00:18.016 --> 00:21.227
Now what, or who,
would you say that is, Monty?

00:28.234 --> 00:29.527
Good Lord.

00:30.570 --> 00:31.821
Big Eric.

00:38.119 --> 00:40.413
Lexie! Golly! Where are you?

00:41.205 --> 00:42.957
What's new, pussycat?

00:43.041 --> 00:44.667
Lexie, my jacket.

00:46.377 --> 00:47.879
Golly!

00:48.629 --> 00:50.381
Come on, come on.

00:54.052 --> 00:57.096
Don't tell me,
you've been invited
on The Clothes Show.

00:59.474 --> 01:02.810
Golly!

01:02.894 --> 01:04.604
What's all the commotion?

01:08.982 --> 01:10.360
Morning, darling.

01:20.203 --> 01:22.038
-Stand aside, boy.
-What?

01:22.121 --> 01:23.498
Give me that.

01:23.580 --> 01:26.334
-But, sir, you should
be careful...
-Stand aside.

01:29.379 --> 01:31.422
Hector, what is it?

01:31.506 --> 01:33.216
Big Eric, Golly. Big Eric!

01:46.479 --> 01:49.232
What's my foolish
husband up to now?

01:49.315 --> 01:50.775
I tried to tell him, honest.

01:50.858 --> 01:52.276
Tell him what?

01:52.360 --> 01:54.153
That the throttle
keeps jamming.

03:18.654 --> 03:21.824
I'll see you later.
Thanks. Bye.

03:21.908 --> 03:24.327
Come on, Terry, get a move on.
Curtain up in three hours.

03:24.410 --> 03:28.039
Right, I've rung round.
Eleven have confirmed,
all bringing partners.

03:28.122 --> 03:31.668
-Archie. Telephone.
-Great, a swarm of
critics all coming here.

03:31.751 --> 03:33.836
No, that's not right.
What is it? A shoal? A flock?

03:33.920 --> 03:36.214
Terry, what's the collective
noun for food writers?

03:36.297 --> 03:39.092
Why are you so calm?
I'm terrified already.

03:39.174 --> 03:40.968
Ah, what can they do apart

03:41.052 --> 03:43.012
from destroy the enterprise
we've slaved for years
to get going?

03:43.096 --> 03:45.181
-Shut up.
-Justine, it'll be wonderful.

03:45.264 --> 03:47.600
You'll be serene
and beautiful.
They'll love our little place,

Nasty accident, dear.

03:55.692 --> 03:57.151
In the loch.

03:58.861 --> 04:00.028
In the loch?

04:01.989 --> 04:03.449
No, of course I'll come.

04:04.659 --> 04:06.911
Yeah,
I'll get the sleeper tonight.

04:08.079 --> 04:09.664
Okay. Bye.

04:13.751 --> 04:15.962
My father's had
some sort of accident.

04:17.922 --> 04:20.298
I'm sorry,
tonight of all nights.

04:20.382 --> 04:24.637
You have to go.
I'll book you a cab to Euston.
I'll manage.

04:26.264 --> 04:30.059
Archie, this is
just a tiny restaurant.

04:30.142 --> 04:32.437
Your family are 10
times more important.

05:19.317 --> 05:21.444
You'll be himself.

05:21.527 --> 05:23.112
Yeah, I suppose I am.

05:30.036 --> 05:31.871
How is he today?

05:31.954 --> 05:33.581
Your dad?

05:33.665 --> 05:35.124
Och, he's in a terrible state.

05:37.251 --> 05:39.462
What did you do that for,
you stupid woman?

05:39.545 --> 05:41.673
Oh, do stop fussing, Hector.

05:41.756 --> 05:43.257
What's he gonna do
when he gets here, eh?

05:43.340 --> 05:46.344
Damn boy's always
been as much use
as a chocolate teapot.

05:46.427 --> 05:49.430
Hector,
you know very well it's time.

05:49.514 --> 05:51.891
I don't want him here.
And what do you want?

05:51.974 --> 05:53.851
Going fishing again,
are we, Hector?

05:53.935 --> 05:56.646
I couldn't find my slippers,
dammit.

05:56.729 --> 05:58.398
Enjoy.

05:58.481 --> 06:01.484
Hags and harpies.
I'm surrounded by
hags and harp...

06:01.567 --> 06:03.069
Where are my Marmite soldiers?

06:03.151 --> 06:05.530
I had them
court-martialled and shot.

06:05.613 --> 06:08.074
I always have Marmite soldiers
with my boiled egg.

06:08.157 --> 06:09.575
Bairns will be bairns.

06:09.659 --> 06:11.577

Ach, away and play
with your lineage.

06:56.247 --> 06:59.375
LEXIE: Mmm, tasty.

06:59.458 --> 07:00.752
Eh, Duncan?

07:02.045 --> 07:04.213
Dun-can. Dun-can't.

Hello?

07:20.480 --> 07:21.689

Oh, darling.

07:30.073 --> 07:31.240
Mother.

07:35.078 --> 07:36.913
-How is he?
-How was your journey?

07:36.996 --> 07:39.666
-How bad is it?
-We're so glad you're back.

07:39.749 --> 07:42.085
-We need you, you see.
-What do the doctors say?

07:42.168 --> 07:46.172
So, the vultures are circling.

07:46.255 --> 07:49.384
-Father.
-Excited by the prospect
of my imminent demise?

07:49.467 --> 07:52.303
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

07:52.387 --> 07:54.514
You're supposed
to be really ill.

07:54.597 --> 07:57.767
I was temporarily
immersed in water.

07:57.849 --> 08:01.854
A trifle peaty
but I don't expect
to start dissolving.

08:01.938 --> 08:04.816
-Just what is going on here?
-How's that bar
of yours doing?

08:04.899 --> 08:07.402
Hector, behave.
Pay no attention, dear.

08:07.485 --> 08:10.362
It's not a bar,
it's a restaurant.
It opened last night and...

08:10.446 --> 08:12.573
Never thought a son of mine
would turn out a publican.

08:12.657 --> 08:14.367
I blame that
awful Thatcher woman.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.285
I'm going back right now.

08:16.369 --> 08:17.996
Darling. I, I...

08:18.079 --> 08:20.623
-And who are you?
-Ah, Robbie, my boy.

08:20.707 --> 08:23.710
Robert Fraser.
Great to meet you.

08:23.793 --> 08:26.212
I, uh, manage the estate.

08:26.295 --> 08:29.298
Under your father's
guiding hand of course.

08:29.382 --> 08:31.634
And a jolly good
job you make of it.

08:31.718 --> 08:33.845
Come, we've work to do.

08:36.347 --> 08:37.557
Mother.

08:40.101 --> 08:41.894
We worked for months,
for years,

08:41.977 --> 08:44.397
to get the premises,
get the money, the staff.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.109
Finally it all comes together,
we plan this big
opening night and where am I?

08:48.192 --> 08:49.944
He was so very fragile.

08:50.028 --> 08:53.364
On a sleeper to Scotland
hurrying to my
dying father's bedside.

08:53.448 --> 08:55.615
I thought you might be
able to help, that's all.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.785
Help with what?

08:57.869 --> 08:59.369
Duncan, where are my bags?

08:59.454 --> 09:01.329
They're in the, um...

09:01.414 --> 09:03.165
I thought you should
like your old room.

09:03.249 --> 09:05.418
I have to get back. I'm sorry.

09:05.501 --> 09:08.171
Whatever you say.
You're a good boy.

09:55.843 --> 09:59.222
Katrina, you'll never guess.
He's returned.

Who, Maureen? The Jedi?

10:02.975 --> 10:04.519
Elvis Presley?

10:04.602 --> 10:08.648
The son and heir.
Archie MacDonald.
After all these years.

10:08.731 --> 10:12.151
Maureen, I will not
have my life defined
by the tedious goings on

10:12.235 --> 10:15.405
at what you're pleased
to call "the Big House".

10:15.488 --> 10:18.241
Very good-looking
from what I hear.

11:02.827 --> 11:04.120
Justine?

11:09.959 --> 11:13.546
Ah, Duncan,
Archie'll be wanting
to go back to the station.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.631
-I'll be ready for him.
-Jolly good.

11:17.550 --> 11:19.677
Geordie, it's Molly.

11:19.761 --> 11:22.096
Hi, it's me. Hello?

11:23.306 --> 11:24.640
Yeah.

11:24.724 --> 11:26.184
Oh, he's fine.

11:26.267 --> 11:28.936
Fontwell Park, 4:30.
Horse called...

11:31.272 --> 11:33.775
"Tickle My Fancy." What price?

11:34.942 --> 11:37.195
Put 50 on for me. Good man.

11:38.404 --> 11:40.531
Well, it's not
quite as simple as that.

11:40.615 --> 11:41.949
Hello?

11:42.033 --> 11:43.284
Oh, God.

Dad's off fishing.

12:52.562 --> 12:53.896
Trying anyway.

12:56.274 --> 12:59.444
-He's a useless specimen.
-Ach, it's the same
throughout nature.

12:59.527 --> 13:02.488
The female does the work.
Making the home,
looking after the bairns,

13:02.572 --> 13:04.282
putting food on the table.

13:04.365 --> 13:05.700
Very funny.

13:05.783 --> 13:08.786
Whereas the male now,
he just stumbles along,

13:08.870 --> 13:11.956
unsure of himself,
what he's
supposed to be doing,

13:12.040 --> 13:13.875
making a mess
wherever he goes.

13:14.917 --> 13:16.919
Just like that fella there.

13:17.628 --> 13:18.796
Where?

13:36.272 --> 13:37.690
Get up.

13:37.774 --> 13:39.901
-Are you mad?
-Too right I'm mad.

13:39.984 --> 13:41.652
-God, I hate you people.
-Katrina.

13:41.736 --> 13:43.613
-Come away out of there.
-Katrina.

13:45.239 --> 13:47.950
Golly? Is that you?

13:48.034 --> 13:49.202
Laddie.

13:51.829 --> 13:53.623
It's great to see you, really.

13:53.706 --> 13:55.667
You've been away
too long, youngster.

13:55.750 --> 13:56.876
Golly...

13:57.627 --> 13:59.128
this is him, isn't it?

13:59.212 --> 14:01.297
I don't know. Are you him?

14:01.381 --> 14:04.884
I was until the wild woman
of the woods started to
rearrange my arms and legs.

14:04.967 --> 14:07.512
-Now listen, you...
-Archie, meet Katrina.

14:07.595 --> 14:11.182
A loyal tenant of
the Glenbogle estate.

14:11.265 --> 14:14.435
-I thought you were
after the ospreys.
-The what?

14:14.519 --> 14:17.230
Big thing with feathers.
Nests in that tree there.

to chinless wonders
who thought

14:19.816 --> 14:21.401
they looked better
on the mantelpiece.

14:21.484 --> 14:23.653
Okay, Mrs Attenborough,
I've seen the documentary.

14:23.736 --> 14:26.406
The nest further up the glen
was robbed last week.

14:26.489 --> 14:28.282
That's why we built the hide.

14:28.366 --> 14:30.660
Organised a rota
to watch the nest.

14:30.743 --> 14:33.079
What she means is
the kids built the hide.

14:33.162 --> 14:35.665
She organised the rota.

14:35.748 --> 14:39.419
Well, if the landowner
won't take his
responsibilities seriously,

14:39.502 --> 14:41.504
the community will.

14:41.587 --> 14:43.840
It's our land really, anyway.

14:43.923 --> 14:46.551
I'm sorry, run that one
past me again, will you?

14:56.019 --> 14:58.229
You have a family, then?

14:58.312 --> 15:00.189
No, I don't.

15:00.273 --> 15:03.234
It's just that Golly
mentioned you had kids.

15:03.317 --> 15:05.987
Oh, I'm the head
teacher of the village school.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.655
Oh, that old place.

15:07.739 --> 15:11.117
It's very well equipped.
And the kids are as
bright as buttons.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.119
I'm sure. I didn't mean...

15:13.202 --> 15:15.580
Good thing, too,
'cause they're the future
of this place, not...

15:16.706 --> 15:19.208
Anyway, are you staying long?

15:19.292 --> 15:21.336
No,
I have to get back tonight.

15:23.588 --> 15:25.506
Well, well,
would you look at that.

15:32.472 --> 15:36.059
We've all manner of
modern contraptions
up here, you know.

wretched hurdy-gurdy off.

You won't catch
much with that object,
laddie, except maybe a cold.

Archie's waiting.

16:56.931 --> 16:58.766

all right to you?

Sorry.

17:59.911 --> 18:01.287
I hope not.

18:03.373 --> 18:05.249
-Och, sorry I'm late.
-Ah.

18:05.333 --> 18:08.419
Great, you're staying.
Love to show you around.

18:08.503 --> 18:11.589
I've had another quote
on the timber, Hector.
Looks quite promising.

18:11.673 --> 18:14.550
-Good boy.
-See, Archie, prices have
fallen through the floor.

18:14.634 --> 18:16.427
Cheap imports
from Scandinavia.

18:16.511 --> 18:18.054
It's hardly worth
growing the things.

18:18.137 --> 18:19.514
But I had this idea...

18:19.597 --> 18:22.475
Don't waste your breath,
Robbie,
he won't be interested.

19:49.771 --> 19:52.357
Hell's flames. Not again.

19:59.614 --> 20:01.366
Oh, heck.

20:01.449 --> 20:02.950
Fuse again.

20:03.034 --> 20:04.994
It's kind of exciting, eh?

20:05.078 --> 20:08.956
Down here in the dark,
crushed up like
a pair of amorous sardines.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.583
Pass us the screwdriver.

20:10.667 --> 20:13.670
You always were one for
your tools, eh, big boy?

20:13.753 --> 20:17.006
(CHUCKLING) Careful, Dunc,
you're squeezing my funbags.

20:19.676 --> 20:23.096
How does she do it?
I've tasted
better shoe leather.

20:23.179 --> 20:24.722
She does her best, dear.

20:24.806 --> 20:27.934
I sometimes think she
does it deliberately.

20:28.017 --> 20:31.229
And what says the expert?
Would you serve this muck?

20:31.312 --> 20:33.022
Tell me, this cafe of yours...

20:33.106 --> 20:35.274
I mean, you have customers,
do they
actually pay you money?

20:35.358 --> 20:37.694
Hector, must you be so rude?

20:37.777 --> 20:40.863
Bad behaviour
is one of the few
privileges of old age.

20:41.948 --> 20:43.866
Anyone for
another slice of Bambi?

20:43.950 --> 20:46.703
Well, who'd have thought it?
You of all people.

20:46.786 --> 20:48.204
Build something of my own,
you mean?

20:48.287 --> 20:50.039
Yes, that must be amazing
to someone like you.

20:50.123 --> 20:51.249
Maybe not.

20:51.332 --> 20:53.626
Glenbogle has been
my career, dear boy.

20:53.710 --> 20:57.380
If you want to see my life,
as Christopher Wren said,
"Look about you."

20:57.463 --> 20:59.799
At what?
This crumbling ruin
where the phone doesn't work

20:59.882 --> 21:02.552
and the lights don't come on?

21:02.635 --> 21:04.929
And the Lord said,
"Let there be light."

21:05.763 --> 21:07.140
Thank you, Robbie.

21:10.309 --> 21:12.353
Sorry you missed
your train, dear.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.731
Very irritating.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.774
Yes.

21:16.858 --> 21:18.818
But I'll make sure I
get it tomorrow night.

ROBBIE: Yeah, no problem.

22:47.073 --> 22:50.535
Ah, I'll call you back.
Mmm. Yes.

22:52.036 --> 22:53.788
Archie. Morning.

22:53.871 --> 22:55.540
We've been reconnected then?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.960
I thought we'd been cut off.

22:59.043 --> 23:01.504
Oh,
things aren't quite that bad.

23:02.463 --> 23:04.090
The estate's in trouble?

23:09.554 --> 23:10.930
Look, um...

23:15.351 --> 23:18.021
Why don't you have
a wee peek at this
on your laptop?

23:19.814 --> 23:22.358
It sets out all
you need to know
in black and white.

23:24.235 --> 23:26.487
And steadily encroaching red.

23:39.292 --> 23:41.294
Blimey.

23:41.377 --> 23:42.879
Have you seen the figures?

23:42.962 --> 23:45.590
Fraser's always
banging on about them.
No time for them myself.

23:45.673 --> 23:47.342
Father, it's serious.
The bank are...

23:47.425 --> 23:49.594
My dear boy,

23:49.677 --> 23:51.763
the MacDonald's have been
in hock to those shysters
since the Battle of Culloden.

23:51.846 --> 23:55.099
You owe them a fortune.
They could sling you
out whenever they wanted.

23:55.183 --> 23:57.810
My father once gave
me the most
wonderful piece of advice.

23:57.894 --> 23:59.228
You've spoken to Fraser?

23:59.312 --> 24:01.689
"Life," he said, "sometimes
bowls one a bumper."

24:01.773 --> 24:04.609
Father, for once will you
please just listen to me?

24:04.692 --> 24:07.945
"But the important thing
is always to play
a straight bat."

24:08.029 --> 24:11.491
This is about the future,
yours and mother's.
You must do something.

24:11.574 --> 24:14.452
I'm very grateful
for your concern,
if not your advice,

24:14.535 --> 24:16.621
but as we've
done without either
for the last 10 years...

24:16.704 --> 24:18.498
Hector, stop this nonsense.

24:19.832 --> 24:21.292
You must tell him.

24:23.044 --> 24:24.170
Tell me what?

24:26.589 --> 24:30.051
Very well.
The estate no longer
belongs to your father.

24:30.134 --> 24:31.678
Molly.

24:31.761 --> 24:34.222
It was made over
to you some time ago
through a trust.

24:36.974 --> 24:40.895
I own the house? The estate?

24:40.978 --> 24:43.690
Legal technicality. Tax dodge.
The lawyers made me do it.

24:43.773 --> 24:47.819
Well, if we hadn't,
you'd have been liable
to crippling death duties...

24:47.902 --> 24:49.445
Well, later on.

24:50.196 --> 24:52.532
I'm Laird of Glenbogle?

24:53.491 --> 24:55.326
You're the only son.

24:55.410 --> 24:58.079
Not how it should have been.

24:58.162 --> 25:00.790
Come on, I think we're
all in need of sherry.

25:00.873 --> 25:03.793
I'm not finished yet.
Not by a long chalk.

25:03.876 --> 25:06.462
I'm still head of the family,
and don't you forget it.

25:17.348 --> 25:20.268
ROBBIE: The place
has been
haemorrhaging cash for years.

25:20.351 --> 25:23.229
Well, you know what
these highland
estates are like.

25:23.312 --> 25:25.148
They need a sugar daddy.

25:25.231 --> 25:26.774
Always have.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.317
Always will.

25:28.401 --> 25:30.278
You were saying
the timber brings in nothing.

25:30.361 --> 25:33.281
Oh, and your father
won't let me market
the sporting side properly,

25:33.364 --> 25:36.117
or raise rents, or sack
any of the estate workers.

25:36.200 --> 25:39.078
I mean Golly for instance,
he's well past
his sell-by date.

25:39.162 --> 25:40.371
Golly's family.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.206
Of course.

25:43.416 --> 25:44.876
He's a marvellous chap.

25:47.170 --> 25:48.338
Anyway...

25:50.506 --> 25:52.508
it's all yours now.

25:52.592 --> 25:55.011
Well, I won't have it.

25:55.094 --> 25:58.473
But I might be able
to persuade my father
to do the sensible thing.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.933
Which is what?

26:01.017 --> 26:02.393
Give you your head?

26:04.979 --> 26:06.439
I could cut the losses...

26:07.565 --> 26:09.108
but it still
wouldn't pay its way.

26:09.650 --> 26:10.985
So...

26:12.403 --> 26:14.614
Well, your parents are

26:14.697 --> 26:17.033
cash-poor but asset-rich.

26:19.452 --> 26:20.828
Well, it's obvious.

26:21.746 --> 26:23.414
Hanging on, it's...

26:24.415 --> 26:26.125
putting off the inevitable.

26:31.047 --> 26:32.465
Sell Glenbogle?

26:36.177 --> 26:40.390
There's a couple of chaps
coming to stalk
tomorrow who, er...

26:40.473 --> 26:42.016
might be interested.

26:49.065 --> 26:53.528
Ah, how is the new proprietor?
Got everything
sorted out, have you?

26:53.611 --> 26:55.822
Lexie, you're
looking very pert today.

26:55.905 --> 26:57.490
Down, Hector.

26:57.573 --> 26:59.617
-Isn't "pert"
the most splendid word?
-Father...

26:59.701 --> 27:01.828
Told me a good one the other
day, didn't you, girl?

27:01.911 --> 27:06.708
Man goes to see quack, says,
"Doctor, I've a cricket
ball stuck up my whatsit."

27:06.791 --> 27:08.251
There's something we
need to talk about.

27:08.334 --> 27:11.212
Doctor says, "How's that?"
Man says, "Don't you start."

27:12.088 --> 27:13.840
Don't you start!

27:16.426 --> 27:19.721
I'm only going
to say this once.

27:19.804 --> 27:23.683
I didn't come back
here because I wanted to.
My life is somewhere else.

27:23.766 --> 27:26.853
And I didn't ask you
to give me the estate.
It's the last thing I wanted.

27:26.936 --> 27:28.813
I told you that years ago.

27:28.896 --> 27:32.233
I didn't do it for you.
For the family.
Fourteen generations of it.

27:32.316 --> 27:33.526
Fairy cake, anyone?

27:33.609 --> 27:36.070
The estate is bankrupt.

27:36.154 --> 27:38.114
Want to run
away again, do you?

27:38.197 --> 27:40.033
There's only one
thing to be done.

27:40.116 --> 27:41.576
It must be sold.

27:43.536 --> 27:45.330
Never!

27:45.413 --> 27:48.875
You have to be
protected from yourself.
I shall sell it for you.

27:48.958 --> 27:53.004
I sometimes wonder what I did
to deserve you as a son.

27:54.422 --> 27:56.007
That's easy.

27:56.090 --> 27:57.759
Impregnated his mother.

27:58.509 --> 27:59.761
Father.

28:01.971 --> 28:03.389
I feel a bit shivery.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.516
I'm going to bed.

28:06.309 --> 28:07.727
Don't be ridiculous.

28:09.896 --> 28:12.273
I don't feel at all well.

28:20.948 --> 28:24.994
MOLLY: Come on, Geordie.
I am not going to
back one of his horses.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.579
The man's hopeless.

28:26.663 --> 28:29.165
He couldn't train
white mice to eat cheese.

28:32.418 --> 28:35.296
I'm sorry, darling.
It was all in a good cause.

28:36.547 --> 28:39.050
This place is no good for me.

28:39.133 --> 28:40.677
I'm going home now.

28:45.556 --> 28:46.849

28:48.101 --> 28:49.310
Duncan!

28:51.771 --> 28:54.816
The station, and no
funny business this time.

29:14.627 --> 29:16.504

the escape committee?

29:35.815 --> 29:37.191
It's Saturday, mate.

29:37.275 --> 29:39.944
I know, Duncan.
I did a time
management course once

29:40.028 --> 29:44.490
and one of the first
things they taught me
was the days of the week.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.159
Sleeper doesn't
run on a Saturday.

29:57.086 --> 29:58.379
I'll walk back.

29:59.547 --> 30:00.965
I need air.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.041
Oi!

30:36.709 --> 30:39.796
Shh, laddie.
You'll disturb the wildlife.

-Come on.
-Golly.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.159

31:51.909 --> 31:53.202
Something sweet.

31:55.788 --> 31:57.206
(WHISPERING) Did you
bring your shotgun?

31:57.290 --> 31:59.208
Nice perfume, lass.

31:59.292 --> 32:03.755

from the hide. There.

to cool your broth.

frighten the ospreys?

They would do if
they had the right tree.

parked at
the house this morning.

talking to the driver.

it won't be the only
way he's robbing your da.

Well, it'll never
stand up in court.

anything about a court?

word with the factor
and then he's out.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.642
My father...

32:57.725 --> 33:00.353
Ah, he's got other worries.

33:00.436 --> 33:01.979
He's not as fit
as he used to be.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.898
Not as young as he used to be.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.486
What is it?

33:10.029 --> 33:11.531
I just found out that

33:11.614 --> 33:13.241
I own the estate.

33:19.539 --> 33:23.001

no disrespect
to the old devil but,

33:23.084 --> 33:24.711
um, I'm delighted.

33:26.212 --> 33:28.172
Yeah.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.299
You'll soon get
things squared round.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.678
I can't stay, Golly.

33:39.225 --> 33:40.393
In fact...

33:42.562 --> 33:44.313
none of us'll be staying.

33:45.815 --> 33:47.817
What's that supposed to mean?

33:50.778 --> 33:52.780
I think we have
to sell Glenbogle.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.282
Sell?

33:56.034 --> 33:57.160
Sell?

33:59.787 --> 34:01.080
Sell your home?

34:02.540 --> 34:04.250
Your birthright?

34:04.334 --> 34:06.544
No, it was never that.
Not mine anyway.

34:06.627 --> 34:09.797
There have been
MacDonalds here for 400 years.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.674
Your name'll be
blackened forever.

34:13.509 --> 34:15.219
You can't do this.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.054
D'you want to
know what'll happen?

34:19.139 --> 34:20.308
I'll tell you.

34:21.391 --> 34:22.976
A new owner'll come in...

34:23.061 --> 34:25.855
jobs'll go,
people's homes with them.

34:25.938 --> 34:27.440

It doesn't have to
be like that, Katrina.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.574
I'm sorry, Golly.

34:36.657 --> 34:38.451
And you're
proposing to just...

34:39.577 --> 34:41.245
just walk away from it?

34:43.289 --> 34:46.542
There's two potential
buyers stalking tomorrow.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.795
I hope you'll give
them a good day's sport.

35:04.769 --> 35:08.272
Oh, the rabbits have
been at everything.
Damn their eyes.

35:09.148 --> 35:10.900
Is Father up yet?

35:10.983 --> 35:13.820
No, he said he's
not getting out of bed
until you come to your senses.

35:13.903 --> 35:16.322
This happens every
time I come home.

35:16.406 --> 35:19.450
I disappoint him and
he makes me feel bad.
It's not easy.

35:19.534 --> 35:21.119
Well, what about the estate?

35:21.202 --> 35:23.705
Oh, poor you.

35:24.455 --> 35:26.666
Here, this might help.

35:26.749 --> 35:27.750
What?

35:30.628 --> 35:32.671
Mother, I thought
all your family money
went years ago.

35:32.755 --> 35:34.756
It did. It's mine.

35:34.841 --> 35:37.677
My winnings on the geegees.

35:37.760 --> 35:41.222
I did it all myself,
with a little help
from Geordie of course.

35:41.305 --> 35:44.726
-Geordie?
-My turf accountant.

35:44.809 --> 35:48.021
Do you know,
it's the first money I've
earned in my whole life.

35:48.104 --> 35:51.107
-Wonderful feeling, isn't it?
-Oh, yes, but...

35:51.190 --> 35:55.862
This is 55,000.
The estate owes the bank 375.

35:55.945 --> 35:58.780
Oh, what a pity. I thought...

35:58.865 --> 36:01.534
Oh, Mother,
you're the best of all of us,
you know that?

36:04.620 --> 36:06.914
What are you going to do? Hmm?

36:06.998 --> 36:11.377
I'd be perfectly happy
with a little flat
in Cadogan Square,

36:11.461 --> 36:16.049
but your father...
it's been his whole life,
every fibre of the old fool.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.508
Who'd catch
Big Eric if he wasn't here?

36:20.553 --> 36:23.389
You know that old
jacket he wears?

36:23.473 --> 36:27.810
He only puts that on
when he's feeling fragile.
Used to belong to Jamie.

36:27.894 --> 36:30.188
I can't see him
leaving here, Archie.

36:30.271 --> 36:32.732
Well, only in a wooden box.

36:32.815 --> 36:34.609
I'm sure you'll
do what's best.

36:53.252 --> 36:55.463
Archie, hello.

36:55.546 --> 36:57.507
Too busy to come on the stalk?

37:00.259 --> 37:02.470
Probably not your
thing anyway. Eh?

37:44.387 --> 37:45.680
I'm sorry.

37:45.763 --> 37:48.975
I'm sure it's the rifle
that's the problem, sir.

37:49.475 --> 37:50.977
Duncan,

37:51.060 --> 37:52.812
take a look at
Mr Potts' piece.

37:55.148 --> 37:56.482
(CAR APPROACHING)

38:04.407 --> 38:06.492
Good morning, gentlemen.

38:06.576 --> 38:08.703
Welcome to Glenbogle.
Archie MacDonald.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.123
I hope you won't
mind if I join you.

38:12.206 --> 38:14.584
I know you're
in very good hands
with old Robbie here

38:14.667 --> 38:18.212
but I think the laird himself
ought to escort such
very important guests.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.798
-You don't mind,
do you, Robbie?
-No.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.634
Of course not, Archie.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.554
Right then,
gentlemen, let's go stalking.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.751
So you and
Mr Andersson are chums,
are you?

38:56.834 --> 38:59.587
Er, met in a balloon,
over the Serengeti.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.798
You know,
one of these luxury safaris.

39:01.881 --> 39:04.634
He's a quiet chap,
but he's canny with it.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.388
You're in
business together, then?

39:08.471 --> 39:11.974
Sort of. Made his cash
in flat-pack furniture.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.894
-I made my pile in pies.
-What?

39:14.977 --> 39:19.232
Anything on four legs,
we'd kill it, mince it,
put puff pastry round it.

39:19.315 --> 39:20.817
Well, used to.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.403
-Co-op just bought us up.
-Oh.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.738
So we're launching this
joint venture, you know.

39:25.822 --> 39:27.865
He's into this shooting lark

39:27.949 --> 39:29.992
so we thought we'd come up
here and see if we could
get something going.

39:30.076 --> 39:31.369
How exciting.

39:35.289 --> 39:36.624
Right, gentlemen.

39:38.292 --> 39:40.586
We're about to
come up to the beasts

39:40.670 --> 39:44.132
so keep low and
don't even fart
unless I give you permission.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.010
Okay?

40:14.746 --> 40:17.540
I do hope that old Robbie's
given you every assistance.

40:17.623 --> 40:19.959
Oh, Robbie
couldn't have done more,
he really couldn't.

40:20.043 --> 40:21.836
Good.

40:21.919 --> 40:24.172
Well, when we get
back we'll have to, uh,

40:24.255 --> 40:25.882
talk figures.

40:25.965 --> 40:29.218
See how your bid matches up to
the one we've
already received.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.929
Another bid?

40:32.013 --> 40:35.350
Robbie never mentioned that.
He said we'd got a clear run.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.602
(WHISPERING) Quiet!

40:37.685 --> 40:40.313
Right, Mr Potts, you first.

40:47.487 --> 40:49.614
What the hell d'you
think you're doing?

40:50.865 --> 40:53.117
Working out your little game.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.244
I've got it, too.

40:55.328 --> 40:57.872
How much of a finder's fee
were you promised, eh?

40:59.290 --> 41:01.167
You're sacked.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.294
We'll see about that.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.505
Your father
would never allow it.

41:05.588 --> 41:08.049
He trusts me...not you.

41:09.133 --> 41:10.593
By heck, what's that?

41:10.677 --> 41:12.887
That, Mr Potts, is Big Eric.

41:13.888 --> 41:16.391
Finest stag I've ever seen.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.727
Been saving him
these past 10 years
for young Mr Archie there,

41:19.811 --> 41:21.479
but what the devil,

41:21.562 --> 41:23.398
you can have him.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.024
You want me to kill him?

41:25.108 --> 41:27.110
Just wait till he turns.

41:27.193 --> 41:30.113
You remember where to line up?
And keep your
breathing steady.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.740
That's it, my friend.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.410
(CLATTERING)

41:36.869 --> 41:38.204
What's going on?

41:38.287 --> 41:41.207
KATRINA:
You're not welcome here.
Get off our land!

41:41.290 --> 41:44.168
Glenbogle's for
the people who live in it,

41:44.252 --> 41:48.381
not absentee feudal landlords
to play with pop-guns.

41:48.464 --> 41:50.341
We demand to be heard!

41:51.551 --> 41:53.386
We demand a voice!

41:53.469 --> 41:55.304
That's the last
thing you need, pet.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.558
Well, gentlemen...

41:58.641 --> 42:01.310
that would appear
to be that for today.

42:25.918 --> 42:30.381
Hector. Um,
I'm afraid I have to raise
a rather painful issue.

42:31.424 --> 42:33.051
Ah, the son and heir.

42:33.134 --> 42:36.512
-Father,
I've just sacked Fraser here.
-I'm not talking to you.

42:36.596 --> 42:39.515
He's crooked.
He's been robbing you blind
since the day he got here.

42:39.599 --> 42:41.309
I'm sorry about
all this, Hector.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.102
You're sorry, Robbie?

42:43.186 --> 42:46.564
-You can't make that
kind of accusation.
-I can if it's true.

42:46.647 --> 42:50.026
Archie seems to have
rather a chip on his shoulder

42:50.693 --> 42:51.861
about me.

42:52.445 --> 42:53.780
I see.

42:53.863 --> 42:55.865
Well, Archie, let me say

42:55.948 --> 42:58.868
that Robbie here is a friend
as well as an employee.

42:58.951 --> 43:00.620
I trust him completely.

43:00.703 --> 43:03.289
Once upon a time,
you might have
fulfilled that function,

43:03.373 --> 43:06.292
but you chose
to turn your back
on your responsibilities.

43:06.376 --> 43:08.127
I had to look
for help elsewhere.

43:09.170 --> 43:10.546
Thank you, Hector.

43:12.006 --> 43:14.300
He's behind the theft
of those osprey eggs.

43:14.384 --> 43:16.469
Oh, don't be silly.

43:16.552 --> 43:19.472
He's always waxing lyrical
about the wretched things.
Goodness knows why.

43:19.555 --> 43:22.475
They catch more salmon
than Golly and
me put together.

43:24.352 --> 43:27.313
He's also planning
to sell the place
behind your back.

43:28.022 --> 43:29.315
What?

43:29.399 --> 43:30.983
Sweet-talking
two millionaires.

43:31.067 --> 43:34.195
Encouraging a bid,
just one bid mind,
no competition.

43:34.278 --> 43:36.280
And at a knock-down price,
I should think.

43:36.364 --> 43:38.199
No!

43:38.282 --> 43:42.412
And getting a sweetener, too.
How much is it?
250? Half a million?

43:45.999 --> 43:47.583
He's got no proof, Hector.

43:49.669 --> 43:51.004
He's barmy.

43:54.424 --> 43:56.050
Well, he hates you.

43:57.343 --> 43:59.554
Who are you gonna believe,
Father?

44:03.307 --> 44:06.019
-Pack your bags and get out.
-Hector.

44:06.102 --> 44:08.146
He's my son.

44:08.229 --> 44:10.314
I don't think my son
would tell me lies.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.984
(SCOFFING)

44:24.579 --> 44:26.331
This place is finished.

44:27.707 --> 44:29.042
And you with it.

44:37.133 --> 44:39.302
I'm sorry,
I know you were fond of him.

44:39.385 --> 44:40.595
Yes.

44:41.596 --> 44:43.139
Still...

44:43.222 --> 44:45.850
one must look on
the bright side.

44:45.933 --> 44:48.770
And which bright
side would that be?

44:48.853 --> 44:52.273
Well, it just puts
a rather different
gloss on things, doesn't it?

44:52.357 --> 44:54.025
How do you mean?

44:54.108 --> 44:56.319
Well, if an honest man
had been in charge,

44:56.402 --> 44:59.781
a good man,
like you for instance,

44:59.864 --> 45:02.658
we'd never have got
into this mess in
the first place, would we?

45:02.742 --> 45:04.619
Father, you... You've...

45:05.453 --> 45:08.206
Oh, God, never mind.

45:08.289 --> 45:11.709
-You'll be
staying then, I take it?
-No! No!

45:31.938 --> 45:33.106
Not you again.

45:33.189 --> 45:35.066
So, have you
sacked him yet, then?

45:35.149 --> 45:37.110
I helped you with
your rotten birds.

45:37.193 --> 45:39.737
You and your family have
a hell of a lot of
ground to make up

45:39.821 --> 45:41.614
before you get
my gratitude, pal.

45:41.698 --> 45:44.742
You know, you are
a very irritating person.
You know that?

45:44.826 --> 45:47.996
You haven't changed.
You always used to sulk.

45:48.079 --> 45:51.582
-What are you talking about?
-Primary school
before they sent you away.

45:51.666 --> 45:54.210
The little girl you
used to sit beside
on the big double desk.

45:54.293 --> 45:55.294
Eh?

45:56.629 --> 45:58.172
Katrina.

45:58.256 --> 45:59.924
Gingernut.

46:00.008 --> 46:03.136
Never, ever call me
that again, d'you hear?

46:03.219 --> 46:05.221
I nearly didn't recognise you.

46:05.304 --> 46:08.433
You used to have as broad
an accent as the rest of us
if I remember right.

46:08.516 --> 46:10.560
It's the main reason
they packed me off
to boarding school.

46:10.643 --> 46:12.895
Can't have the son of a laird
sounding Scottish, can we?

46:12.979 --> 46:14.689
Don't get me started.

46:15.982 --> 46:19.402
Can I tell you
what I really think?

46:19.485 --> 46:23.614
I think the idea of anybody
owning all this is obscene.

46:23.698 --> 46:25.408
How can you buy a view, eh?

46:26.743 --> 46:28.786
But if anybody's
going to own it,

46:28.870 --> 46:31.497
it should be the community
actually making a living here.

46:31.581 --> 46:32.915
Oh, get real, Katrina.

46:32.999 --> 46:34.792
But in the meantime...

46:34.876 --> 46:37.962
rather than some mega-rich
idiot from south
of the border,

46:38.046 --> 46:40.089
better the devil you know.

46:40.173 --> 46:42.925
In this case,
the dashing young laird.
That right?

46:44.010 --> 46:45.720
I don't want it.

46:45.803 --> 46:49.640
I don't want to live
in a freezing castle
with my barmy father,

46:49.724 --> 46:52.226
where the lights
go off all the time
and the phone never works.

46:52.310 --> 46:54.562
I do not want to be a laird.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.689
Do you really
hate it that much?

46:58.649 --> 47:01.027
I was eight when I left.

47:01.110 --> 47:05.573
I missed it so much,
it was like
having an arm cut off.

47:05.656 --> 47:08.993
What I'd do when I was low,
I'd phone that box.

47:09.077 --> 47:12.288
Stand in a dark corridor
somewhere in Berkshire

47:12.372 --> 47:14.624
and imagine the phone ringing
in all this silence.

47:14.707 --> 47:18.419
All this around it,
the water, the hills.

47:18.503 --> 47:21.839
I can still remember
the number, Glenbogle 249.

47:21.923 --> 47:24.133
It couldn't go on,
I had to put a stop to that.

47:24.217 --> 47:26.761
Especially after Jamie died.

47:26.844 --> 47:28.429
I have to get away, Katrina.

47:28.513 --> 47:30.348
Poor little Archie.

47:30.431 --> 47:33.935
Don't you think other
folk have got problems, too?

47:34.018 --> 47:38.564
There's people here,
on your land, sweating their
guts out for nothing.

47:38.648 --> 47:40.733
On the breadline some of them.

47:40.817 --> 47:43.569
And here you are,
master of all he surveys,

47:43.653 --> 47:47.281
whingeing on about
how terrible life is.

47:47.365 --> 47:51.160
What gives you the right
to expect everything
to be the way you want it?

47:51.244 --> 47:53.329
Why don't you just go away?

47:53.413 --> 47:55.456
Why don't you?

47:55.540 --> 48:01.170
Back to your swanky restaurant
and your beautiful girlfriend
and your perfect life.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.061
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

48:45.381 --> 48:46.632
MAN: There you are.

48:51.262 --> 48:52.805
Hey!

48:52.889 --> 48:54.307
What are you doing?

48:56.684 --> 48:59.520
-What do you
think you're doing?
-None of your business, son.

48:59.604 --> 49:01.189
You can't take this.

49:01.272 --> 49:03.900
It's scheduled for removal.
I've got the docket.

49:06.027 --> 49:07.403
Who are you anyway?

49:07.487 --> 49:09.989
Me? I'm the...

49:10.073 --> 49:13.201
I'm a member of
the community here.
And that's our phone box.

49:13.284 --> 49:16.954
So you can take your lorry,
your crane and your bad
attitude and get lost, okay?

49:17.038 --> 49:20.792
MAN: Leave it, Jim.
That's the new
laird you're talking to.

49:47.068 --> 49:48.736
Justine?

49:48.820 --> 49:50.446
Hello, sweetheart, it's me.

49:51.447 --> 49:52.782
How did the do go?

49:54.325 --> 49:55.493
Great.

49:57.203 --> 49:58.830
Yeah.

49:58.913 --> 50:01.082
Listen, Justine...

50:01.165 --> 50:03.751
I've got a bit
of a problem here.
