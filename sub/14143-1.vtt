WEBVTT

00:28.153 --> 00:31.111
I met her in a border town j

j we proceeded to get down j

00:35.077 --> 00:36.783
I she turned me on j;

j I dropped the telephone j

00:43.335 --> 00:46.623
j moonlight

00:47.172 --> 00:49.959
j and the touch of her hand j

00:50.133 --> 00:51.919
j it makes me high j

00:53.595 --> 00:56.052
j like the fourth of July j

00:57.933 --> 01:01.425
j a bad bandito came into town j

01:01.979 --> 01:05.141

01:05.774 --> 01:10.768
j but these words

01:13.365 --> 01:15.856
j little bit

01:16.868 --> 01:19.780
j sometime you want
the whole enchilada j

01:20.872 --> 01:23.454
j little bit

01:24.543 --> 01:27.910
j a little bit
or nothin' at all j

01:48.942 --> 01:51.979
J said Cancun

01:52.696 --> 01:55.654
j turistas there,
they drove her wild &

01:55.991 --> 01:57.777
j the border"s the place j

01:59.286 --> 02:01.948
j put on a brand-new face j

02:04.166 --> 02:07.203
j me and the boys
were just in town j

02:08.002 --> 02:10.995
j shake 'em up
and roll 'em down j

02:11.298 --> 02:12.708
j I guess it was fate j

02:14.676 --> 02:16.712
j I hope I wasn't too late j

02:19.097 --> 02:22.510
j bad, bad boys

02:23.352 --> 02:26.310
j federales want us

j sometime you want

02:45.540 --> 02:48.782
j a little bit
or nothin' at all j

02:58.136 --> 02:59.136
Oh, man.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.939
Hey, you derelicts,
you know what time it is?

03:01.056 --> 03:01.715
Yeah. What's up?

03:01.973 --> 03:04.840
It is bug betting time,
all right?

03:05.102 --> 03:06.888
First bug to get
fried wins $2.00.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.342
I got this green one
right there.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.130
All right, Earl, you gotta actually
let go of the money

03:16.154 --> 03:17.215
in order for it to be a bet.

03:17.239 --> 03:17.978
All right, come to daddy.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.646
All right. Round
and round she goes.

03:19.825 --> 03:20.865
Where she stops, nobody...

03:20.951 --> 03:22.031
Number 2!

03:22.119 --> 03:24.701
Aah! Winner, winner,
chicken dinner!

03:24.871 --> 03:26.532
J a little bit
is better than nada j

03:27.499 --> 03:30.332
j sometime you want
the whole enchilada j

03:32.337 --> 03:34.168
any of you shitheels
ever get bored?

03:34.506 --> 03:35.506
Huh?

03:35.882 --> 03:36.917
You ever get bored?

03:39.010 --> 03:40.010
I got a riddle.

03:40.679 --> 03:41.679
You got a riddle?

03:42.472 --> 03:44.884
Takes about two ounces of brains
to figure it out.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.078
Anybody think they got a brain

03:47.102 --> 03:48.512
with two ounces of brains in it?

03:49.104 --> 03:50.844
There's a rumor Earl does.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.751
Well, for Christ's sakes,
boys, come on,

03:53.775 --> 03:56.215
a little self-confidence
from the players' gallery, all right?

03:56.528 --> 03:57.859
We ain't talking long division.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.424
How much we got to lose?

03:59.448 --> 04:00.925
You want to liven
things up, Earl?

04:00.949 --> 04:02.189
That's a hell of an idea.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.109
So everyone puts in 20 bucks.

04:05.287 --> 04:07.027
Pot goes to whoever
solves the riddle.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.695
You're gonna get
the riddle, tin cup.

04:10.876 --> 04:13.037
Dewey, I'm the one
asking the riddle.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.605
I already know the answer, okay?

04:14.629 --> 04:16.290
I don't... I don't get a guess.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.045
All right.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.418
Although we could say
if I get to 500 bounces

04:19.593 --> 04:20.708
on the old wedge here

04:21.052 --> 04:22.212
and no one gets the riddle,

04:22.429 --> 04:23.464
I get the pot.

04:24.306 --> 04:25.408
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.072
You're thinking it's
an impossible riddle.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.720
Well, it's not.
It's a easy riddle.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.135
And if somehow,
by the grace of fluke luck,

04:31.813 --> 04:34.475
I win, and y'all don't
agree that it was a easy riddle,

04:34.816 --> 04:35.816
well, then, hell, uh,

04:36.526 --> 04:37.561
I'll refund your money.

04:41.573 --> 04:42.153
I'm in!

04:42.324 --> 04:43.801
- All right! All right!
- Money in the bank.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.656
I'll hold the money.
Come on. Give it up.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.409
Now, a man's driving
down the road with his son,

04:48.914 --> 04:50.120
and he gets in a crash.

04:50.582 --> 04:51.617
Two ambulances come

04:51.875 --> 04:54.912
and take the man and his son
to different hospitals.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.417
Okay? Different hospitals.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.963
Son goes into the operating
room, all right?

05:00.842 --> 05:02.423
The doctor looks at him, says,

05:03.678 --> 05:05.259
"I can't operate on this boy.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.139
He's my son.”

05:07.390 --> 05:09.927
Now, how is that possible, hmm?

05:10.519 --> 05:11.850
How is that possible?

05:23.615 --> 05:24.695
Clock's ticking, fellas.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.427
The father's still
over at the other hospital.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.887
I mean, he didn't
sneak back in, right?

05:27.911 --> 05:28.696
This ain't Star Trek, Earl.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.030
Nobody beamed him aboard.

05:30.205 --> 05:33.948
All right. What about if, uh,
if the father married the son's daughter?

05:34.125 --> 05:35.228
This is a family riddle, Earl.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.368
You got... you gotta think
clean thoughts.

05:37.587 --> 05:38.793
Hey, give us a little hint.

05:38.964 --> 05:39.703
You want a hint, Clint?

05:39.881 --> 05:40.495
Little hint.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.379
All right.

05:41.550 --> 05:42.835
The doctor's a woman.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.964
The doctor's a woman.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.097
See, the doctor's
the son's mother.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.017
Feminists posed the riddle

05:53.061 --> 05:55.848
to reveal how deeply our
sexual stereotypes run.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.770
L, uh, take it
you're a feminist.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.004
Ma'am, I've been called
a lot of things before,

06:02.028 --> 06:03.768
- never been saddled with that one.
- Ah.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.023
Smell of leather,
sting of a whip.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.201
- Ooh!
- Mercy.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.596
Well, I'm just
a humble golf pro.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.700
Could I help you?

06:12.122 --> 06:13.487
You're Roy mcavoy, the golf pro?

06:13.832 --> 06:14.491
Mm-hmm.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.658
Oh, well, I-l pictured
something, uh, different.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.001
I have a 7:00 lesson.

06:20.422 --> 06:21.787
I thought I had a Dr. griswold.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.009
Uh-huh...

06:25.135 --> 06:26.135
That's me.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.345
Okay.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.666
First thing you gotta learn
about this game, doc,

06:38.690 --> 06:40.681
is it ain't about hitting
some little white ball

06:40.859 --> 06:41.859
in some yonder hole.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.187
It's about inner demons:

06:43.612 --> 06:44.943
Self-doubt, human frailty,

06:45.113 --> 06:46.944
and overcoming all that crap.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.115
Oh, yeah.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.155
So what kind of doctor
did you say you were?

06:50.577 --> 06:51.577
I'm a psychologist.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.527
In layman's terms call me

06:53.705 --> 06:56.287
Neo-jungian, postmodern,
freudian, holistic, secularist.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.460
Okay.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.289
I mean, inner demons
and human frailty,

07:01.463 --> 07:02.583
well, that's my life's work.

07:02.714 --> 07:03.920
I used to practice in El Paso,

07:04.090 --> 07:05.375
but I moved here now.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.416
What is all this stuff?

07:07.594 --> 07:09.550
Oh, I ordered all this
from the golf channel.

07:09.888 --> 07:12.550
It's a... it's a waste of money.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.010
Well, no, I'm... look, I'm sure

07:15.185 --> 07:17.145
that there are some excesses
and repetitions here,

07:17.312 --> 07:18.956
but I believe in
the gathering of knowledge,

07:18.980 --> 07:20.971
and I thought, you know,
there must be some truth

07:21.149 --> 07:23.309
to the golf swing illustrated
by some of these devices,

07:23.401 --> 07:24.962
and that you would just
kind of help me, you know,

07:24.986 --> 07:26.146
sort through it all.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.562
I have dozens of golf
videotapes, too.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.025
I'll bet she's got a golf watch.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.617
You got a golf watch?

07:32.327 --> 07:33.988
Yeah. I-l think I got
a pretty good one.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.284
Right there.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.135
Well, take it off.

07:37.707 --> 07:38.976
- Take it off?
- All of it, right now.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.786
Just... all of it now.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.841
You're a smart woman,
for Christ's sakes, right?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.463
Jeez.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.334
Don't you know
the work of hustlers when you see it?

07:47.801 --> 07:48.881
Well, no.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.002
I mean,

07:52.347 --> 07:54.884
I can always tell when
someone's lying to himself, okay?

07:55.183 --> 07:57.014
But I'm quite susceptible
and frequently wrong

07:57.185 --> 07:58.391
when that person lies to me.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.973
I mean, Christ, this stuff
cost me over $200.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.934
Well, it's uh, $200 of shit.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.516
Well, that's just great.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.172
Why don't we do this
the old-fashioned way?

08:08.196 --> 08:09.436
Just go take a swing.

08:10.615 --> 08:11.615
All right.

08:16.913 --> 08:17.913
Okay.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.417
Come on.

08:24.379 --> 08:25.379
Excuse me.

08:27.549 --> 08:28.755
= oh!

08:30.385 --> 08:31.385
Fuck.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.340
Well, you talk like a golfer.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.885
That's a pretty girl
to have such an ugly swing.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.051
= oh! God!

08:41.395 --> 08:42.395
Oh, that hurt.

08:43.063 --> 08:44.063
Shit!

08:45.900 --> 08:47.231
Fuck. Shit.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.100
Those are highly
technical golf terms.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.019
You're using them on
your very first lesson.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.229
This is promising.

08:53.742 --> 08:54.742
Right.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.233
Okay, wise-ass.

08:56.745 --> 08:57.745
Show me. Just go ahead.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.010
Something like that.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.429
That's impressive.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.422
You know, look, I tend
to process things verbally,

09:18.600 --> 09:20.119
so do you think you
could break down into words

09:20.143 --> 09:21.143
how you just did that?

09:25.273 --> 09:29.266
You mean, what is the...
What is the golf swing, by Roy mcavoy?

09:31.780 --> 09:34.066
Well, I tend to think
of the golf swing as a poem.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.238
Oh, he's doing that
poetry thing again.

09:36.618 --> 09:39.109
Critical opening phrase
of this poem will always be the grip,

09:40.038 --> 09:41.778
which the hands unite
to form a single unit

09:41.956 --> 09:43.446
by the simple overlap of the...

09:45.168 --> 09:46.208
Little finger.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.419
Right.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.122
Lowly and slowly...

09:49.672 --> 09:51.583
The club head is led back,
pulled into position,

09:51.758 --> 09:54.295
not by the hands,
but by the body,

09:54.469 --> 09:55.738
which turns away
from the target,

09:55.762 --> 09:56.989
shifting weight
to the right side

09:57.013 --> 09:58.674
without shifting balance.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.713
Tempo is everything,
perfection unattainable.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.723
As the body coils now
to the top of the swing,

10:02.894 --> 10:04.509
there's a slight hesitation,

10:04.813 --> 10:06.269
a little nod to the gods,

10:07.232 --> 10:08.597
uh, a nod to the gods?

10:08.775 --> 10:09.775
Yeah.

10:09.859 --> 10:10.859
To the gods.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.434
That he is fallible.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.485
That perfection is unattainable,

10:14.656 --> 10:16.817
and now the weight begins shifting
back to the left,

10:16.991 --> 10:18.982
pulled by the powers
inside the earth.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.242
It's alive, this swing,
a living sculpture,

10:21.412 --> 10:23.824
and down through
contact, always down,

10:24.165 --> 10:25.621
striking the ball crisply...

10:26.501 --> 10:27.661
With character.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.792
A tuning fork goes off
in your heart,

10:30.171 --> 10:31.171
your balls.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.172
Such a pure feeling
is the well-struck golf shot.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.209
And then
the follow-through to finish,

10:38.763 --> 10:39.843
always on line.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.592
The reverse "c"
of the golden bear.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.559
The steelworker's power
and brawn of Carl sandburg's...

10:46.729 --> 10:48.310
= Arnold Palmer!

10:49.607 --> 10:51.518
Oh, he's doing
that Arnold Palmer thing.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.773
And the unfinished
symphony of Roy mcavoy.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.115
Um...

10:58.324 --> 10:59.860
What? What's unfinished?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.822
Well, I have
a short follow-through, it...

11:03.580 --> 11:04.911
Has a unfinished look.

11:05.790 --> 11:06.790
Why?

11:08.251 --> 11:10.211
Well, some say it's because
that's the easiest way

11:10.336 --> 11:12.247
to play through
the winds of west Texas, and...

11:12.547 --> 11:16.039
Some say it's because
I've never finished anything in my life.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.296
You can decide, but the point is

11:20.096 --> 11:21.961
every finishing position
is unique.

11:22.557 --> 11:23.557
Huh.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.600
That's what the golf
swing's all about.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.178
It's about gaining
control of your life

11:30.356 --> 11:32.893
and letting go at the same time.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.102
Jeez, Louise.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.840
There's only one other
acceptable theory

11:38.948 --> 11:40.108
about how to hit a golf ball.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.323
Oh, boy. Well,
I'm afraid to ask.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.759
Well, what is it?
What's the other theory?

11:45.413 --> 11:46.698
Grip it and rip it.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.829
Well, you know, um...

11:52.712 --> 11:56.204
While I do appreciate
your poetic sensibility, Mr. mcavoy.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.382
Call me Roy, Molly.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.007
Well, call me Dr. griswold,
Roy, but at this point,

12:00.178 --> 12:02.418
I really think I'm more
of the grip-it-and-rip-it school.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.088
Well, then, let's tee it up.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.760
All right, waggle.

12:08.478 --> 12:09.478
Waggle.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.105
No, no.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.475
He's got her waggling now.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.148
- Oh, lord.
- Waggle the clubhead.

12:16.527 --> 12:17.527
Okay? = ah.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.190
It's a little relaxing ritual we do,

12:20.365 --> 12:21.365
- mm-hmm.
- Okay?

12:21.449 --> 12:22.609
- Okay.
- Just waggle it.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.698
Waggle it and let
the big dog eat.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.124
What big dog?

12:31.459 --> 12:32.739
The driver, the number one wood.

12:32.877 --> 12:33.536
Well, this is metal.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.231
Yeah. Well, woods are metal.
Don't worry about it.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.041
And the... the driver's
known as the big dog.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.877
I'm just saying,
"let him loose. Let 'er rip.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.468
Let the big dog eat.”

12:41.594 --> 12:42.594
Okay.

12:42.887 --> 12:43.887
Okay.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.105
Oh!

12:53.273 --> 12:54.273
Oh.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.606
You know, this is without a doubt
the stupidest, silliest,

12:57.777 --> 12:59.893
most idiotic grotesquery
masquerading as a game

13:00.071 --> 13:01.271
that has ever been invented...

13:01.322 --> 13:01.981
- Ever.
- Yes, ma'am,

13:02.156 --> 13:03.316
and that's why I love it.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.901
Now, you hit
one good shot, okay?

13:05.076 --> 13:08.443
One, and that tuning fork
rings in your loins...

13:10.915 --> 13:12.951
You can't wait to get back.

13:13.418 --> 13:14.624
Try it again.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.805
=- mim-hmm.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.092
Well, I think the big dog just
ate something there.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.267
Mm-hmm.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.260
Did that tuning fork
ring in your loins?

13:34.272 --> 13:36.103
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.899
Well, I always say
quit on a good shot.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.188
We'll call that
lesson humber one?

13:42.613 --> 13:44.274
Well, oh, okay.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.279
And, um...

13:47.368 --> 13:50.110
If you wouldn't mind
paying me in cash?

13:51.331 --> 13:54.368
There's a little situation
I'm dealing with with the IRS, okay?

13:54.542 --> 13:55.031
Mm-hmm.

13:55.209 --> 13:58.121
With those guys, I gotta Bob and
weave around the facts of life,

13:58.296 --> 13:59.296
if you know what I mean.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.671
Yeah. Look, can I
ask you a question?

14:03.134 --> 14:05.295
If you're such a legendary striker
of the golf ball,

14:05.470 --> 14:08.132
as everyone says,
then why are you, at your age,

14:08.306 --> 14:09.586
out here in
the middle of nowhere

14:09.640 --> 14:12.723
operating a barely solvent
establishment, ducking the IRS,

14:12.894 --> 14:14.174
collecting
a few pathetic dollars

14:14.228 --> 14:15.228
to buy your next six-pack

14:15.313 --> 14:16.928
when you're capable
of so much more?

14:17.231 --> 14:19.893
Jj

14:21.652 --> 14:23.563
Perhaps I'm chock full
of inner demons.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.865
- No.
- Hmm?

14:27.033 --> 14:28.648
You're chock full of bullshit.

14:29.911 --> 14:30.911
Anyway...

14:31.245 --> 14:32.245
Same time next week?

14:33.164 --> 14:35.701
Jj

14:38.378 --> 14:41.040
W-what do you mean I should
try being saddled sometime?

14:43.424 --> 14:46.382
Were you being literal, or was that
some freudian type of deal?

14:47.345 --> 14:48.345
Molly?

14:48.638 --> 14:49.343
Doctor?

14:49.639 --> 14:50.970
What kind of saddle?

14:51.641 --> 14:55.600
Jj

15:17.375 --> 15:18.706
David Simms.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.783
What the hell
you doing here, man?

15:21.045 --> 15:22.330
Hey there, Romeo.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.000
Been a while, hasn't it? = yeah.

15:25.842 --> 15:26.842
Tin cup around?

15:27.385 --> 15:28.385
Uh, no.

15:28.511 --> 15:31.173
He's in, um, Houston
on, uh, business, so.

15:32.557 --> 15:35.197
Anyway, I thought you were
supposed to be on the big pro golf tour.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.303
Well, you tell tin cup
that I'm in town

15:40.481 --> 15:42.813
for my big charity
best ball tournament.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.020
And I got a spot for him

15:45.778 --> 15:47.314
if he ever gets back from, uh...

15:48.656 --> 15:49.816
Huh? Uh, Houston.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.450
Yeah. Wherever.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.653
Well, uh, I thought
you hated him, man.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.657
Hell, I haven't even
thought about him in a dozen years.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.829
Not since the good old days
at the university of Houston

16:02.795 --> 16:04.751
when we won all them
titles together.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.880
God almighty. =

16:08.050 --> 16:10.770
well, he says he carried you
on his back all them years, man.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.591
Well, I didn't have much
craft back then, Romeo,

16:13.764 --> 16:16.096
just a little native ability.

16:17.727 --> 16:21.015
Now, old Roy, he's
a helluva ball striker, isn't he?

16:21.898 --> 16:22.898
What do you want, man?

16:25.026 --> 16:26.732
I want to win my own
tournament, Romeo.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.028
Bet you do.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.399
Now, old Roy, he can help me

16:29.489 --> 16:31.855
if we can manage to behave
like grownups together.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.649
Yep. You never know, huh?

16:37.955 --> 16:38.955
You tell him that.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.321
- Yeah. I'll be sure to tell him.
- So what's the...

16:42.251 --> 16:44.617
What's the catch, David?

16:47.048 --> 16:48.048
Hello, cup.

16:49.634 --> 16:50.874
There is no catch.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.766
I put together this
little tournament, with a...

16:54.472 --> 16:56.053
An elite field of players,

16:56.390 --> 16:57.755
and a half-million dollar purse,

16:58.893 --> 17:01.384
and, by god, I'm tired of seeing
the money head out of town.

17:01.896 --> 17:02.976
Make more birdies.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.058
Yeah. Well...

17:09.237 --> 17:10.646
That's where you
come in, partner.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.395
I need you on my team.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.698
Well, I repeat.
Uh, what's the catch?

17:16.077 --> 17:18.944
We're playing cottonwood,
where you once shot a 59.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.994
Where you can still shoot
a 65 in your sleep.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.406
Because you know every bump
on every fairway

17:24.585 --> 17:26.997
and every subtle break
on every green.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.005
Hot tub, Roy?

17:31.676 --> 17:32.676
It's a spa.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.052
You and me at cottonwood.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.430
Kind of like the old days,
isn't it?

17:44.730 --> 17:46.516
Yeah, well,
put 'er there, partner!

17:47.692 --> 17:49.372
These two homeboys
are gonna show the world

17:49.402 --> 17:51.017
what golf in west Texas
is all about.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.695
Hell, I'll be a goddamn
birdie-making machine for you out there.

17:54.865 --> 17:57.447
Oh, whoa. Whoa, wait
a minute there, Roy.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.788
Hell, I didn't mean
I wanted you to play with me.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.823
I want you to caddy for me.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.580
You know, read the Greens,
club me, that kind of stuff.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.997
Que te lleva la chingada,
cabron, que caddy con nadie.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.175
Caddy?

18:14.969 --> 18:16.084
Come on, Roy.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.150
Hell, I can't bring a guy in
off the street

18:18.306 --> 18:19.591
to play in my tournament.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.550
I mean, for Christ's sake, guys,

18:23.811 --> 18:25.517
this has become
a big-time event.

18:26.314 --> 18:29.272
Hell, I got corporate sponsors,
30 bucks a ticket.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.981
This guy off the street

18:31.152 --> 18:33.609
can kick your ass
on the golf course anytime, man.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.382
Just like he kicked your ass
in junior golf,

18:35.406 --> 18:37.886
just like he kicked your ass
in university... no. Fuck it, man.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.576
I'll give you 100 bucks
for the loop.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.154
And five percent of
any earnings, Roy.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.573
Get the hell out of here, man,

18:47.918 --> 18:49.829
and take your pinche
color-coordinated,

18:50.004 --> 18:51.335
corporate-sponsored chingada and

18:51.589 --> 18:52.816
take a flying fuck on the rolling...
= Romeo.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.200
I got it man.
Don't worry about it.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.093
Well,

18:58.262 --> 18:59.656
I was just trying
to offer you some work.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.000
Yeah. Thank you very much.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.558
David?

19:04.310 --> 19:05.310
Yeah?

19:06.520 --> 19:07.635
I'll take the job.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.771
Yeah. We'll take the job.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.772
I flat broke j

19:19.950 --> 19:21.861
j and busted j

19:23.204 --> 19:25.035
just don't seem fair j

19:26.582 --> 19:28.743
the man in heaven j

19:29.794 --> 19:31.830
j don't hear my prayer j

19:32.963 --> 19:36.000
j and these dice are loaded j;

19:36.550 --> 19:39.007
I but! Still can't win j

19:39.804 --> 19:41.886
I flat broke and busted j

19:42.056 --> 19:43.283
this looks like it
might be a little more

19:43.307 --> 19:44.587
than you got
in the bag, partner.

19:44.767 --> 19:45.767
I could make that.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.431
J all crapped out a... j

19:49.605 --> 19:50.605
shit.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.556
J; Gain j

19:53.901 --> 19:54.901
is he on?

19:55.653 --> 19:56.653
He's on.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.443
Pretty good shape, too.

19:59.657 --> 20:00.487
I mean, my guy could do it.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.114
I've seen him
do it lots of times,

20:03.411 --> 20:05.823
and you have extra-large huevos.

20:15.923 --> 20:16.537
Hit it!

20:16.716 --> 20:17.716
Oh!

20:19.135 --> 20:21.091
Oh! Oh!

20:21.262 --> 20:22.422
Shit!

20:22.805 --> 20:23.805
Fuck that!

20:24.223 --> 20:26.159
I told you that was more
than you had in your bag.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.639
Shit, I had to, partner.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.329
I mean, your damn caddy
came by and told me

20:29.353 --> 20:30.793
that he'd get on
the green from here.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.648
I could.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.774
I got to hand it to you, Roy.

20:41.615 --> 20:44.982
For 15 holes,
you seemed to grasp the concept here.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.280
See, I'm trying to
win this tournament,

20:47.580 --> 20:49.286
and your job is to help me.

20:52.710 --> 20:53.415
Give me the 7-iron.

20:53.711 --> 20:54.711
I'm gonna lay up.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.539
David, you can make that shot.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.878
Hell, I can make
that shot, easy.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.799
I know I can make
this goddamn shot,

21:05.973 --> 21:07.713
but the smart play is to lay up.

21:09.643 --> 21:10.923
These people didn't pay 30 bucks

21:11.061 --> 21:13.518
to see a tour star lay up
on a short par five.

21:13.856 --> 21:16.472
I'm sitting on a two-shot lead
with three to go.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.978
Thanks to you,
my partner's in his pocket.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.443
Suddenly, par's
a helluva number to me.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.855
13 years on the tour,
you're still a pussy.

21:24.074 --> 21:27.282
God damn it, David.
Just hit the fucking three.

21:27.870 --> 21:28.870
Hit it.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.744
13 years on the driving range,

21:31.081 --> 21:33.914
you still think this game is about
your testosterone count.

21:35.211 --> 21:36.211
Now, back up.

21:39.965 --> 21:43.173
230 to carry and
the tour stars lay it up.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.262
So Simms, from the rough,

21:56.565 --> 21:57.565
that's a smart play.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.649
Hey, David, you
in a hurry or what?

22:07.868 --> 22:08.527
Why?

22:08.744 --> 22:10.013
I got a pile of nickels
in the car

22:10.037 --> 22:11.677
that your caddy can
knock it on from here.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.666
"Come on, guys, we're...

22:15.042 --> 22:16.322
Trying to win a tournament here.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.772
Yeah. We are.
That's great, but I got five to one.

22:18.796 --> 22:19.581
I think it's pretty good odds.

22:19.797 --> 22:20.797
I think he can do it.

22:21.090 --> 22:23.109
Come on. Let him hit it.
It's only an exhibition.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.249
C'mon. Come on, Roy.
You can handle it.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.427
I got a ball.

22:26.887 --> 22:27.887
Right here.

22:29.390 --> 22:31.221
Balls versus brains, Roy.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.966
You hit that shot,
just keep walking

22:34.353 --> 22:35.638
'cause your ass is fired.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.481
How are you gonna fire me
in front of all these people,

22:47.449 --> 22:49.030
especially when I
knock it on the green?

22:49.493 --> 22:52.155
It looks like the caddy
wants to hit the shot.

22:52.955 --> 22:54.555
Peter kostis, what's
going on down there?

22:54.874 --> 22:58.241
Boys, I think things have
officially changed here now.

22:58.502 --> 23:01.209
Forget the two-shot lead.
Forget three holes to go.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.120
Hey, Roy, you need a glove.

23:04.091 --> 23:04.671
It'll help.

23:04.842 --> 23:07.070
There's a little side
action going on down there.

23:07.094 --> 23:11.337
And, uh, the $250,000 purse
has just gotten a little bit bigger.

23:11.765 --> 23:14.131
Gary, Gary, you obviously
don't think this guy

23:14.310 --> 23:15.390
can pull this shot off?

23:15.561 --> 23:17.080
I'll tell you what.
I don't think there's any chance.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.456
Let me give you
a little background here.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.096
This impending disaster's
a driving-range pro.

23:21.317 --> 23:22.477
His name is Roy mcavoy.

23:24.778 --> 23:27.507
The locals around here tell
me he was a pretty good college player.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.009
He hung around
the mini-tours for a while.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.760
Well, he's gonna have to have
been a helluva college player

23:30.784 --> 23:31.614
to pull this shot off.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.025
He's got 240 yards.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.784
He's got a national
television audience.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.242
He's got a big gallery here,

23:36.290 --> 23:37.601
and he hasn't hit
a golf ball yet.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.644
Announcer well, this is something
we don't see every day:

23:39.668 --> 23:41.624
National television
with no warmup.

23:41.795 --> 23:43.075
How do you like those odds, Bob?

23:43.213 --> 23:44.274
I don't know who this guy is,

23:44.298 --> 23:46.658
but if this guy even
gets it out of there, I'd be surprised.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.415
A tour pro I'd give ten to one.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.171
Dollar bills.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.010
Oh!

23:52.181 --> 23:53.512
Jj

23:54.433 --> 23:55.798
Oh, he's got that good.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.180
Announcer do you believe this?

24:01.941 --> 24:03.226
Unbelievable.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.606
What a caddy.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.988
You. Yeah. You.
Come here. Come here.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.107
Can you carry that bag? = yeah.

24:15.496 --> 24:16.531
- Pick it up.
- Yes, sir.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.207
Nice shot, Roy. Though shot.
= thanks.

24:22.378 --> 24:23.578
Come here. Come here a second.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.328
Take a hike. The loop's over.

24:28.425 --> 24:29.710
You can't fire me.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.864
- Hey, David, come on, man.
- How can you fire me?

24:32.888 --> 24:36.176
I... hey, I just knocked it
stiff from 250.

24:36.350 --> 24:37.180
- Come on.
- Come on, David.

24:37.351 --> 24:38.557
He's always been a jerk.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.184
What about my money?

24:40.437 --> 24:42.769
You just hit the shot that
took you out of the money, bud.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.475
Welcome to life on the tour.

24:44.942 --> 24:45.681
Jj

24:45.859 --> 24:46.689
Hey! Hey, whoa!

24:46.860 --> 24:49.522
Announcer tonight, the sports machine
brings you a bizarre incident

24:49.697 --> 24:52.939
at the charity golf event
of tour star David Simms.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.073
Let's go to west Texas,

24:55.327 --> 24:57.693
well, driving-range pro
tin cup mcavoy,

24:57.871 --> 24:59.611
serving as a caddy
fo David Simms

24:59.790 --> 25:00.870
at the celebrity event...

25:01.083 --> 25:03.699
He grabbed a 3-wood
out of his own bag

25:04.169 --> 25:06.706
and drilled a 240-yard shot

25:06.880 --> 25:08.541
over water to the 16th green...

25:08.716 --> 25:10.126
If I had it all to do over,

25:11.510 --> 25:12.750
I'd still hit that shot.

25:13.679 --> 25:14.679
Yeah. I know.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.215
Man, you'd bury yourself alive

25:17.266 --> 25:18.906
just to prove you
could handle the shovel.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.179
You know why I'd
still hit that shot?

25:21.895 --> 25:22.895
Yeah.

25:23.313 --> 25:25.395
'Cause it's the only way
you could beat Dave Simms.

25:25.691 --> 25:26.691
No.

25:27.317 --> 25:28.712
'Cause you get
that look in your face.

25:28.736 --> 25:31.728
I'd hit it again because that shot
was a defining moment,

25:32.281 --> 25:34.021
and when a defining
moment comes along,

25:34.324 --> 25:35.404
you define the moment,

25:36.243 --> 25:37.608
or the moment defines you.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.740
I did not shrink
from the challenge.

25:41.040 --> 25:41.529
I Rose to it.

25:41.707 --> 25:44.995
1981, fort Washington golf club,
Fresno, California.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.169
Ring a bell?

25:46.712 --> 25:48.773
The final round
of the tour qualifying school?

25:48.797 --> 25:50.708
I was playing to win.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.382
Tried to hit that same
impossible cut 3-wood into the wind

25:54.553 --> 25:55.553
from a hilly lie.

25:55.846 --> 25:56.846
I was playing to win.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.416
Five in a row out of bounds

25:58.932 --> 26:00.217
till you finally pulled it off

26:00.809 --> 26:03.141
and tapped it in
for a crowd-pleasing 13

26:03.687 --> 26:05.848
when a 12 would have
got you on the tour.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.893
And the definition was "shit."

26:12.988 --> 26:14.944
Greatness courts failure, Romeo.

26:16.033 --> 26:17.819
You may be right, boss,
but you know what?

26:19.119 --> 26:21.235
Sometimes par
is good enough to win.

26:29.421 --> 26:30.501
We owe her $12,000.

26:30.631 --> 26:33.338
No. I owe her $12,000,
all right? 1 owe her.

26:33.550 --> 26:36.292
Okay, fine. You owe her $12,000.
Like it makes a difference.

26:36.470 --> 26:37.590
It makes a difference.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.299
Look, boss, I only got one rule,

26:39.515 --> 26:42.348
and that's never bet money
that you don't have on a dog race

26:42.518 --> 26:44.554
with an ex-girlfriend
who happens to be a stripper.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.733
Now you broke that rule, and you're gonna
have to be sweet to her, homes.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.584
Look, you gotta tell her something
nice to start off with.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.889
You know, kind of like an ice breaker.
How hard can it be?

26:52.027 --> 26:53.227
Look, I'll say one thing nice.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.278
If it don't come out right,
then you say it better.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.483
Hey, tin cup.
Doreen's looking for you.

26:57.658 --> 26:58.658
Yeah, I'll bet she is.

26:58.784 --> 27:03.118
J oh, baby,
you look so good to me j

27:05.541 --> 27:06.541
hey, tin cup.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.081
Haven't seen you for three days.

27:08.252 --> 27:09.252
I'm a busy man.

27:10.254 --> 27:11.254
Hey, tin cup.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.248
Hi, sweetie.

27:12.422 --> 27:13.422
Hi, honey.

27:20.430 --> 27:21.840
That better be you, Roy.

27:22.266 --> 27:23.847
Just be nice, okay?

27:29.523 --> 27:30.523
Doreen.

27:31.775 --> 27:34.687
You're looking
particularly lovely this evening.

27:35.112 --> 27:37.569
Uh, yeah, that's even nicer
than the leopard suit, the...

27:37.739 --> 27:39.019
Cut the horseshit, guys.

27:39.449 --> 27:41.155
You owe me $12,000.

27:41.410 --> 27:43.388
And we're... and we're gonna pay it.
Don't worry about that.

27:43.412 --> 27:45.277
Oh, I know you're gonna pay me.

27:45.622 --> 27:48.113
12 smackeroos. Where is it?

27:50.502 --> 27:51.161
There.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.336
What is this?

27:53.422 --> 27:57.131
With equity and inventory,
it's worth 12 grand,

27:57.676 --> 27:58.676
more or less.

27:58.719 --> 28:01.381
This is how you think
you're gonna settle up?

28:01.638 --> 28:03.754
By giving me the deed
to your driving range.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.012
Only on the condition
that you don't sell right away,

28:06.143 --> 28:08.008
and me and Romeo keep our jobs.

28:08.353 --> 28:12.221
What in the world would I want with
your stupid driving range?

28:12.608 --> 28:15.850
Equity, inventory, cash flow,

28:16.111 --> 28:18.727
not to mention an enhanced stature
in the community,

28:18.906 --> 28:22.444
plus a prepaid membership in
salome chamber of commerce.

28:24.161 --> 28:25.526
What are your labor costs?

28:26.371 --> 28:28.491
Everybody gets what they're get...

28:34.296 --> 28:36.787
But the tractor kid
gets five bucks an hour.

28:41.178 --> 28:43.214
And Romeo gets 10, cash.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.719
What do you pay yourself?

28:46.516 --> 28:47.516
Myself?

28:47.726 --> 28:50.342
You know, to stand around
all day and hit those little golf balls,

28:50.646 --> 28:52.602
when you're not breaking
for beers or corn dogs

28:52.773 --> 28:54.209
or to gather the guys up
and lay bets

28:54.233 --> 28:55.993
on which crow's gonna
fly off the fence next.

28:57.361 --> 28:59.192
Are you referring to
my managerial salary?

28:59.404 --> 29:01.844
I am referring to every red nickel
that you take from the till

29:01.990 --> 29:03.927
and every bag of beer nuts
that you lift from the rack.

29:03.951 --> 29:05.691
That is what I'm referring to.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.860
He'll take the deal.
He'll take the deal.

29:09.957 --> 29:10.957
What is the deal?

29:11.833 --> 29:15.325
Okay, let's just say
the driving range is worth 10,000.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.164
You still owe me 2.

29:22.261 --> 29:26.300
J maybe tomorrow j

29:27.182 --> 29:28.718
j I'll see some light j

29:30.936 --> 29:33.143
j and I'll know the difference j

29:33.730 --> 29:35.812
j between wrong and right »

29:37.401 --> 29:39.312
j my ship is out there j

29:40.529 --> 29:43.191
j no, but it can't come in j

29:43.865 --> 29:46.948
I flat broke and busted j

29:47.369 --> 29:50.861
j crapped out again j

29:53.875 --> 29:54.955
she's been here a while.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.170
Am I early?

29:58.547 --> 30:00.208
Mr. mcavoy, I can appreciate

30:00.382 --> 30:02.998
that you have a fairly laid-back,
relaxed lifestyle,

30:03.176 --> 30:04.586
but I have hours to keep.

30:05.220 --> 30:09.839
All right. A former paramour
once ascribed my fluid sense of time

30:10.017 --> 30:11.973
to being born under
the sign of pisces.

30:13.186 --> 30:16.394
Something about... floating
through the universe.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.559
Oh. You amuse me, Roy,

30:19.318 --> 30:21.809
but I'm the only woman
in America born after world war il

30:21.987 --> 30:23.773
who thinks astrology's
a crock of shit.

30:23.947 --> 30:25.483
Now let's see if
the big dog'll eat.

30:26.366 --> 30:27.366
Waggle.

30:28.744 --> 30:29.744
I'm waggling.

30:29.786 --> 30:31.556
Set up to the ball
like I showed you last time.

30:31.580 --> 30:32.786
I am setting up to the ball.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.744
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.

30:35.917 --> 30:36.497
Yeah.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.388
Quit trying to wring
the club's neck, Molly.

30:38.712 --> 30:39.371
All right?

30:39.546 --> 30:42.083
Show a little warmth,
a little compassion.

30:43.717 --> 30:46.424
Remember, this game's
about trust and touch...

30:47.804 --> 30:48.804
And lettin' go,

30:49.514 --> 30:52.176
so while I subtly enhance
your technical prospects,

30:54.311 --> 30:57.098
why don't you tell me all about
your personal life?

30:57.439 --> 30:58.759
That's none of
your business, Roy.

31:00.817 --> 31:03.524
Your boyfriend's a golfer.
That's my bet.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.027
And he's the reason
you're taking this game up. Hmm?

31:06.782 --> 31:08.272
Hell, I probably even know him.

31:08.450 --> 31:10.486
Get your hands off her ass, Roy.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.205
Hi, honey.

31:15.165 --> 31:16.165
Hi, darlin'.

31:16.416 --> 31:17.935
He's taking her to Miami

31:17.959 --> 31:19.495
for the fucking doral.

31:20.337 --> 31:21.952
How am I supposed to
compete with that?

31:22.130 --> 31:24.212
Man, you are having
a bad week, aren't you?

31:24.466 --> 31:27.333
Man, she must think
I'm such a nothing, such a loser.

31:27.511 --> 31:30.674
A lousy driving-range pro
living in a winnebago.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.176
She don't know
you live in a winnebago.

31:33.517 --> 31:36.008
Well, she sure as hell
knows I ain't taking her to no doral

31:36.186 --> 31:38.848
for massages and mimosas
all weekend.

31:39.523 --> 31:41.013
Hmm? =

31:41.191 --> 31:42.977
oh, god. I didn't leave it out.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.151
Well, I didn't.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.216
Gotta do something with my life.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.696
You just threw that in the spa.

31:50.450 --> 31:53.487
Gotta rise to a level
worthy of the women who think I'm a joke.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.550
Well, you could go out
and win the us open.

31:55.622 --> 31:56.622
That would impress her.

31:57.290 --> 31:57.824
What?

31:58.250 --> 31:59.290
Win the open, man.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.707
She'll think,
"oh, you're wonderful, Roy."

32:04.214 --> 32:06.045
Romeo, that idea has promise.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.985
Are we talking about the same
golf tournament, huh?

32:08.009 --> 32:10.500
The us open, the biggest golf
tournament in the world.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.639
Not just the biggest golf
tournament in the world,

32:13.223 --> 32:15.714
the most Democratic
golf tournament in the world.

32:15.892 --> 32:17.007
What do you mean?

32:17.644 --> 32:18.929
- Well, I mean it's open.
- So0?

32:19.104 --> 32:22.688
It's open. Anybody with a two handicap
or better has got a shot at it.

32:22.858 --> 32:25.315
You just gotta get through
a local and sectional qualifier,

32:25.485 --> 32:29.023
and unlike doral or colonial or at&t,
they can't keep you out.

32:30.073 --> 32:32.735
They can't ask you if you're
a-a garbage man or a bean picker

32:32.909 --> 32:36.151
or a driving-range pro
whose check's signed by a stripper.

32:37.164 --> 32:38.904
You qualify, you're in.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.601
Yeah, you don't got the game, man.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.035
I got every shot in the book.

32:42.210 --> 32:44.166
I'm talking about the game.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.875
The mental game, you know,
la cabeza. You don't got it.

32:47.841 --> 32:49.422
Well, since you're
the authority,

32:49.593 --> 32:52.926
how'd you like to teach me
what I ain't and never will be?

32:53.096 --> 32:54.461
What... what for, man?

32:54.639 --> 32:56.004
You never listen to me. Never.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.798
Well, this time
will be different,

32:58.977 --> 33:00.017
- yeah, right.
- I promise.

33:00.145 --> 33:02.665
You don't even have the money to get
your golf clubs out of hock,

33:02.689 --> 33:04.270
and you're gonna win
the us open.

33:04.733 --> 33:05.768
That don't fit, man.

33:06.568 --> 33:08.183
Don't force it if it don't f...

33:09.863 --> 33:12.104
Ahh, is that what
those things were?

33:12.282 --> 33:13.522
- Flowers?
- Flowers.

33:14.659 --> 33:15.887
Let me get this straight.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.902
You're gonna play me
for $400 with those?

33:18.079 --> 33:21.537
Yeah, and I'll give you
2 strokes a side.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.078
You ain't got no 400 bucks.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.664
I-I got the title of
my car for collateral.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.462
I ain't interested
in that piece of shit.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.841
That's 'cause you think of it as
transportation, Boone.

33:34.304 --> 33:35.794
Think of it as bragging rights.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.825
Think of yourself
sitting around the bar

33:37.849 --> 33:40.340
crowing to your cronies
about the Cadillac you won from me.

33:40.602 --> 33:41.842
They'll...

33:42.020 --> 33:45.057
They'll forget all about
the winnebago you lost to me.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.109
I'll call the ins on you,
you little midget.

33:51.571 --> 33:53.857
I'll be playing
a pink lady today.

33:54.699 --> 33:56.985
Is that little pink fag ball
supposed to intimidate me?

33:58.328 --> 34:00.319
Well, not unless
I knock it by you.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.319
Louisville slugger, please.

34:03.083 --> 34:05.415
J I'm drivin' down the highway,
headed to the range j

34:05.585 --> 34:06.785
j gonna knock 'em out strong j

34:06.878 --> 34:07.878
oh!

34:09.714 --> 34:11.250
J got an old brown bag j

34:11.550 --> 34:12.568
I believe you're away.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.002
Don't worry about it, Julio.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.531
I thought I caught that thing
way the hell on the toe.

34:16.554 --> 34:19.467
J there's a place for you
if you're just like me j

34:21.059 --> 34:21.764
- whoo!
- You drive for show,

34:21.935 --> 34:23.596
and you putt for dough,
big mouth.

34:24.145 --> 34:27.181
You hear that, Romeo?
Boone was being profound.

34:27.649 --> 34:29.168
Let's see,
little wind left to right.

34:29.192 --> 34:30.853
I highly recommend the shovel.

34:31.027 --> 34:32.483
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.762
J well, there's a place for
you if you're just like me j

34:39.786 --> 34:41.429
all right, I want
to see a legitimate swing.

34:41.454 --> 34:42.193
No scooping.

34:42.371 --> 34:43.703
J I'm notrich,
and I'm not on TV j

34:44.081 --> 34:46.539
j have another cool one,
but it won't hurt j;

34:46.710 --> 34:48.510
j got myself a big stick
swingin'in the dirt j

34:48.670 --> 34:49.670
I'll finish.

34:52.299 --> 34:54.790
J got myself a big stick
swingin'in the dirt j

34:54.967 --> 34:56.299
get the hell off my golf course.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.426
Uh, need a receipt?

35:00.682 --> 35:01.701
You know what I think, grasshopper?

35:01.725 --> 35:03.261
She's got you by the huevos.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.160
Listen, swami, your job's to teach
me Patience and humility,

35:06.271 --> 35:08.227
all right, not advise me
on my love life.

35:08.690 --> 35:10.330
Not all my thinking
occurs below the belt.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.003
I mean, I actually
stand for a few things

35:12.027 --> 35:14.359
besides where my next
romantic interlude's coming from.

35:14.571 --> 35:15.276
Well, then great.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.174
You won't have any trouble
telling the doctor lady

35:17.198 --> 35:19.118
you can't teach her no more
until after the open.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.344
Well, now that would make
an issue

35:20.368 --> 35:22.054
of something that's
not a issue, now wouldn't it?

35:22.078 --> 35:23.078
Yeah, right.

35:24.039 --> 35:25.119
I am!

35:25.582 --> 35:26.582
This is my quest!

35:27.125 --> 35:29.186
This is where I stand up
for all the little guys everywhere

35:29.210 --> 35:32.919
who've had their fill
of soulless robots like David Simms.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.789
Well, David Simms
may be a soulless robot,

35:35.967 --> 35:37.832
but he's a rich,
happy soulless robot

35:38.178 --> 35:40.214
with a beautiful
doctor lady girlfriend.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.116
Besides, how's
getting in the open

35:42.140 --> 35:43.721
gonna change
what she thinks about you?

35:44.851 --> 35:47.183
Well, it'll show her
I'm not who she thinks I am.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.769
But you are who
she thinks you are, man.

35:49.939 --> 35:53.932
No, Roy, I will not give you
time off to go win the open.

35:54.527 --> 35:55.983
I don't care
if it is your quest.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.360
How about my destiny?

35:57.530 --> 35:58.861
Or your destiny.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.070
Or any other term

36:00.241 --> 36:01.761
you vaguely remember
from your cliff notes.

36:01.785 --> 36:03.804
That's the most stupid
thing I've ever seen in my life.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.640
Don't get mean, all right?
First you get mean, then you get petty.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.701
You should have been a little nicer to me
when we were an item,

36:08.875 --> 36:10.957
and maybe I wouldn't be
such a nasty boss.

36:11.419 --> 36:14.786
Yeah. Roy, I've got a business
to run. Bye-bye, bon voyage.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.817
You know what, Becky, Becky,
Becky, come here, sweetheart.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.527
Right now, hurry up.
We don't have a lot of time.

36:18.551 --> 36:20.791
Now, you're doing a natural thing,
and it's really sweet,

36:20.845 --> 36:22.565
but you know what?
We don't do natural here.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.171
We do big and bold. Colorful.

36:24.349 --> 36:25.589
Hair, lots of it, many colors.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.803
Look at me.
That's what we do, okay?

36:31.398 --> 36:32.934
Well, if you're gonna
take that tone,

36:33.108 --> 36:34.708
then we'll just have to
talk another day.

36:34.776 --> 36:37.267
I'm sorry, uh,
I have things to do,

36:37.445 --> 36:39.606
and I don't really need
to be treated like that,

36:39.781 --> 36:41.897
so good-bye.

36:43.451 --> 36:44.929
You know, it wouldn't
kill you just once

36:44.953 --> 36:46.909
to tell her something
like that she's beautiful

36:47.080 --> 36:48.866
or that she can dance, or

36:49.249 --> 36:50.455
she's sexy as hell.

36:50.709 --> 36:51.915
Here I am, ready to...

36:52.085 --> 36:54.076
Charge forth in pursuit
of my mythic destiny,

36:54.254 --> 36:56.620
I can't even get
time off work to do it.

36:57.882 --> 36:59.463
Well, uh, I'm no expert here,

36:59.634 --> 37:03.092
but it seems to me
that the pursuit of a mythic destiny

37:03.263 --> 37:06.755
isn't something you need to get off
a $7-an-hour job in order to do.

37:06.933 --> 37:09.015
I'm stuck, man. I'm buried.

37:09.185 --> 37:10.185
I need help.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.304
I need advice, I need counseling.
I need a...

37:14.816 --> 37:15.816
I need a shrink.

37:16.151 --> 37:17.607
You don't know no shrinks.

37:18.695 --> 37:19.695
I know one.

37:21.698 --> 37:23.984
No, no, no, no.
Not the doctor lady.

37:24.325 --> 37:24.984
Why not?

37:25.160 --> 37:27.441
You can't ask advice
about the woman you're trying to hose

37:27.495 --> 37:28.951
from the woman you're
trying to hose.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.165
Why not?

38:12.373 --> 38:14.204
Jj

38:48.535 --> 38:50.116
Sue Ann. Sue Ann, honey.

38:50.286 --> 38:51.305
I didn't... I didn't
say shit to her.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.194
Roy, oh!

38:53.957 --> 38:56.869
Okay, Roy, get in
the other room, please.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.619
Sue Ann, honey, it's okay. Okay.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.744
Hey, look, she was crying
when she came out there, all right?

39:08.972 --> 39:12.590
Okay, okay, Roy. Roy!
That is a patient exit room.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.203
Well, I knew it was
some kind of room.

39:14.227 --> 39:16.809
It wasn't painted.
There was no magazines out there.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.061
Roy, why are you here?

39:20.859 --> 39:21.859
Therapy.

39:23.862 --> 39:24.977
You've come for therapy?

39:25.405 --> 39:26.019
Okay, look, Roy,

39:26.197 --> 39:28.117
you know, you really need
to make an appointment,

39:28.157 --> 39:30.148
because I have a client
in a half an hour.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.901
That's enough time, 30 minutes.
Hell, I'm not that fucked up.

39:33.538 --> 39:35.018
Okay, Roy, you know what?
Why Don"t...

39:35.164 --> 39:36.844
Why don't you just have a seat
right there?

39:36.875 --> 39:37.875
Right over there.

39:41.588 --> 39:42.588
Okay.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.759
Okay, so how do I do it?

39:59.314 --> 40:00.019
Therapy, I mean...

40:00.189 --> 40:01.929
I mean, w-how do I
start doing it?

40:02.108 --> 40:04.394
Okay, Roy, well,

40:04.819 --> 40:06.355
in parlance
you might understand,

40:06.529 --> 40:08.440
just kick back
and let the big dog eat.

40:14.954 --> 40:15.784
Suppose there's this guy,

40:15.955 --> 40:18.742
and he's standing
on the shore of a big, wide river,

40:18.917 --> 40:21.750
and the river's full of
all manner of disaster, you know?

40:21.920 --> 40:24.878
Piranhas, alligators,
Eddies, currents, shit like that.

40:25.465 --> 40:27.376
Nobody'll even go
down there to dip a toe,

40:27.634 --> 40:29.486
and on the other
side of the river is a million bucks,

40:29.510 --> 40:32.252
and on this side of
the river is a rowboat.

40:34.557 --> 40:35.091
Mm-hmm.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.386
I guess my question is this.

40:37.185 --> 40:40.348
What would possess a guy
standing on shore to swim for it?

40:40.897 --> 40:41.897
He's an idiot.

40:42.148 --> 40:44.480
No, see, he's a helluva swimmer.

40:44.651 --> 40:46.482
See his... his problem is more like

40:46.653 --> 40:50.066
why does he always
have to rise to the challenge?

40:50.490 --> 40:51.855
He's a juvenile idiot.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.041
You don't understand
what I mean by the river.

40:54.118 --> 40:54.698
Roy.

40:55.036 --> 40:56.196
We're talking about you

40:56.454 --> 40:58.445
and what you like to call
your inner demons,

40:58.623 --> 41:00.659
that human frailty
you like to blather about.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.491
Not some mythopoetic
metaphor you come up with

41:03.670 --> 41:06.537
in a feeble and transparent effort
to do yourself credit.

41:07.757 --> 41:09.497
You mean you're gonna
make me feel lousy?

41:09.842 --> 41:10.376
No.

41:10.551 --> 41:11.570
I came here to feel better.

41:11.594 --> 41:13.238
- I mean, what kind of therapy is this?
- Roy. Roy, Roy, Roy.

41:13.262 --> 41:15.127
You don't have any inner demons.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.509
What you have is inner crap-ola,

41:17.684 --> 41:18.764
inner debris, garbage,

41:18.935 --> 41:20.471
loose wires, a few.

41:21.104 --> 41:22.469
Horseshit in staggering amounts.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.979
Look, I'm not some just
jerk driving-range pro

41:25.149 --> 41:28.107
who drinks too much booze,
eats too few vegetables, okay?

41:28.277 --> 41:30.313
Roy, could you please
sit down, okay?

41:30.488 --> 41:32.007
'Cause... 'Cause you're getting defensive,

41:32.031 --> 41:34.773
and I want you to just cut
to the chase and tell me why you're here.

41:37.412 --> 41:38.412
Woman.

41:38.621 --> 41:39.986
Oh, a woman.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.492
Have you asked her out?

41:43.584 --> 41:45.744
No. She's seeing a guy.
I don't know how serious it is.

41:45.837 --> 41:48.328
But the guy's
a real horse's ass if you ask me.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.622
Maybe if you shared your heart
with this woman,

41:50.800 --> 41:52.069
you know,
took her out to dinner,

41:52.093 --> 41:54.960
then it would... it would force these
issues out to the open.

41:55.263 --> 41:57.003
Well, I'm afraid she'll say no.

41:57.306 --> 41:58.671
So what you're saying is that

41:58.850 --> 42:01.933
all your speeches about swimming across
shark-infested waters

42:02.103 --> 42:04.594
are really about your golf game,
not about your personal life.

42:04.772 --> 42:06.558
Oh, jeez.

42:06.733 --> 42:08.377
So good, we're getting
a little close to the truth.

42:08.401 --> 42:10.754
Well, Christ, I didn't know
we were gonna get into my personal life.

42:10.778 --> 42:11.858
Well, this is therapy, Roy.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.190
Well, I know, but I didn't...

42:14.115 --> 42:15.795
I didn't think it was
that kind of therapy.

42:15.992 --> 42:17.448
Well, okay, let's
make this simple.

42:17.618 --> 42:19.358
Roy, please, here,
sit down right here.

42:20.038 --> 42:22.266
You know those risks that
you love to take on the golf course?

42:22.290 --> 42:25.123
The ones that you talk
so passionately and poetically about.

42:25.585 --> 42:27.166
Well, you need to apply
those same risks

42:27.336 --> 42:29.827
to your personal life
with the same passion.

42:30.214 --> 42:31.574
You mean I should
just ask her out?

42:31.799 --> 42:32.333
Yes.

42:32.508 --> 42:34.419
And risk coming right
over the top, snap,

42:34.594 --> 42:35.794
hooking it out of bounds left.

42:35.928 --> 42:36.587
Absolutely, Roy.

42:36.763 --> 42:37.468
Hittin' it a little thin.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.638
- Okay, Roy. That's good.
- I'm sorry.

42:39.807 --> 42:44.471
Now look, all you have to do is walk up
to this... this woman, wherever she is,

42:44.771 --> 42:46.636
look her in the eye...
Look at me, Roy.

42:47.482 --> 42:48.597
Just look her in the eyes.

42:48.775 --> 42:50.265
That's right,
let down your guard

42:50.443 --> 42:52.525
and don't try to be cool
or smooth or whatever.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.686
Just be honest and take a risk.

42:54.989 --> 42:57.718
And then you know what? Whatever
happens, if you act from the heart,

42:57.742 --> 42:59.278
you can't make a mistake.

43:16.969 --> 43:17.969
Dr. griswold.

43:18.471 --> 43:19.471
Yes?

43:20.223 --> 43:21.633
I think I'm in love with you.

43:22.683 --> 43:24.411
- What?
- From the moment I first saw you,

43:24.435 --> 43:28.348
I knew I was through with bar girls
and strippers and motorcycle chicks,

43:28.523 --> 43:31.310
and when you first started talking,
I was smitten with you,

43:31.484 --> 43:34.601
and I'm... smitten with you
more every day I think about you,

43:34.779 --> 43:37.270
and the fact that you know
I'm full of crap-ola

43:37.448 --> 43:39.404
only makes you even
more attractive to me.

43:40.118 --> 43:42.575
Usually I can bullshit people,
but I can't bullshit you,

43:42.745 --> 43:45.202
and in addition,
you got... you got great legs,

43:45.373 --> 43:47.409
and most women,
I'm thinking about

43:47.583 --> 43:50.103
how to get in their pants from day one,
but with you I'm just...

43:51.838 --> 43:55.126
I'm just thinking about
how to get in your heart, and...

43:55.800 --> 43:57.040
Roy, uh...

43:57.218 --> 43:58.698
- Stunned, huh?
- Yeah.

44:00.513 --> 44:02.504
So, uh, so what about dinner?

44:02.682 --> 44:05.219
And, uh, we can talk about us
and if we have a future

44:05.393 --> 44:07.433
and how to drop that
horse's-ass boyfriend of yours.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.260
Roy, just slow down, okay?

44:09.522 --> 44:11.979
What? I just hit a 8-degree
driver off the carpet.

44:12.150 --> 44:13.418
I mean, I'm staring
eagle in the face.

44:13.442 --> 44:15.170
Okay, will you just cut
the golf talk, please?

44:15.194 --> 44:16.234
Because this is a mistake.

44:16.571 --> 44:17.631
Well, I'm acting from the heart.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.020
How can that be a mistake?

44:19.907 --> 44:20.907
Right?

44:20.992 --> 44:22.983
Wrong, Roy, I mean...

44:23.786 --> 44:26.118
Shit. I didn't know
you were talking about me, Roy.

44:26.664 --> 44:28.384
Well, would your advice
have been different?

44:30.459 --> 44:33.701
Uh, ha. Roy...

44:36.799 --> 44:37.901
You know, this session is over.

44:37.925 --> 44:39.040
I have someone coming soon.

44:39.218 --> 44:40.424
I think you better leave.

44:43.181 --> 44:44.637
I take it your answer is no.

44:45.516 --> 44:49.008
Well, our relationship is,
and will remain, strictly professional.

44:51.314 --> 44:52.314
That's it?

44:53.608 --> 44:54.608
Yeah.

44:58.821 --> 45:02.279
Well, I'm gonna qualify for the us open
and kick your boyfriend's ass.

45:07.788 --> 45:10.017
And whatever you think of me,
you should know that your boyfriend,

45:10.041 --> 45:13.078
he hates old people,
he hates children, and he hates dogs,

45:13.252 --> 45:16.369
and that broad's out there crying still,
all right? In the exit room.

45:16.672 --> 45:17.941
You're still in the exit room.

45:22.261 --> 45:23.261
Oh...

45:29.393 --> 45:30.007
Hello.

45:30.311 --> 45:32.927
Um, Dr. kasseldorf,
you're there.

45:33.564 --> 45:35.646
Wy-well, you always, uh,
you always said to call

45:35.816 --> 45:38.023
if... if something came up
tha... that confused me,

45:38.194 --> 45:39.934
and, uh, you know,
shrinks need shrinks,

45:40.112 --> 45:42.694
but, uh, it happened.
I mean... l mean, you said it would.

45:42.865 --> 45:46.357
Uh, a patient... a patient came in and
thinks that he's falling in love with me.

45:46.535 --> 45:49.415
Well, I mean, he's not really a patient,
he's... he's my golf pro, but...

45:49.830 --> 45:51.741
No. I know that
under the circumstance,

45:51.916 --> 45:53.836
that I'm supposed to
recommend another therapist,

45:53.960 --> 45:56.042
but there are no other
therapists in salome.

45:56.212 --> 46:00.501
I mean, he'd have to drive
100 miles to midland or Odessa,

46:00.675 --> 46:02.757
and I'm not sure you could
count on any help there.

46:03.386 --> 46:07.220
Me? No, my self-esteem...
My self-esteem is fine.

46:07.390 --> 46:08.596
My self-esteem is fine.

46:09.684 --> 46:11.299
Well, he's a good-looking man.

46:12.270 --> 46:14.226
Green eyes, I don't...
I mean, I don't know...

46:14.397 --> 46:15.637
That's not the point, is it?

46:16.440 --> 46:19.978
Well, he's, you know,
he's kind of cute. He's cute.

46:21.779 --> 46:22.779
B-but I mean...

46:26.242 --> 46:26.901
Okay.

46:27.076 --> 46:29.442
Jj

46:29.996 --> 46:30.996
Okay.

46:31.706 --> 46:32.706
Okay.

46:34.250 --> 46:35.250
Uh-huh.

46:49.181 --> 46:52.673
J oh, I wish I could laugh

46:53.269 --> 46:56.477
j when I look way back j

46:57.857 --> 47:03.853
j find out who stole
all my dreams j

47:05.531 --> 47:09.945
j oh, I wish it was easy j

47:10.119 --> 47:13.361
I to face the fact j

47:14.123 --> 47:20.710
j there was
nobody there but me j

47:30.723 --> 47:34.807
J there was nobody there j

47:35.478 --> 47:37.059
«j but me j

47:37.313 --> 47:38.313
hello.

47:45.571 --> 47:46.571
Hi.

47:49.784 --> 47:51.445
You got a beautiful swing, Roy.

47:52.578 --> 47:53.863
I'm a beautiful guy.

47:55.122 --> 47:57.488
Look, Roy, I came here
to apologize, okay?

47:57.833 --> 47:58.833
For what?

47:58.876 --> 48:00.662
Well, you did exactly
what I said,

48:00.836 --> 48:02.916
and I just poured cold water
over your efforts, okay?

48:03.047 --> 48:04.047
I didn't get it.

48:04.757 --> 48:06.713
I'm a, like, terrible
shrink probably.

48:07.301 --> 48:09.212
Should've never
gotten out of real estate. Shit.

48:09.678 --> 48:13.591
Actually, I should've never left Ohio
for that cowboy in amarillo, but...

48:14.767 --> 48:16.052
Have you ever been to amarillo?

48:16.811 --> 48:17.811
Cowboy?

48:18.604 --> 48:20.344
Yeah. I mean,
it's not as romantic

48:20.523 --> 48:22.263
when you're actually
with one, trust me.

48:22.525 --> 48:24.265
I mean, so the oilman
in Dallas or Houston

48:24.443 --> 48:25.587
orl don't know
where he was from.

48:25.611 --> 48:27.897
Anyway, he just
looked great after that...

48:28.072 --> 48:30.108
Oh, boy. So I... that's when
I went to the Gulf,

48:30.282 --> 48:32.193
and I ended up in,
like, trailer sales,

48:32.618 --> 48:34.825
and then all those condos
in corpus christi.

48:35.037 --> 48:37.369
The bottom just...
Boom... fell right out of the market,

48:37.540 --> 48:39.701
and I just... l needed a new gig.

48:40.209 --> 48:41.289
A new gig?

48:42.128 --> 48:44.995
Therapy. I mean,
I took all the classes.

48:45.172 --> 48:48.084
I'm, you know,
legitimate, legal, certified.

48:48.300 --> 48:50.791
Fuck. I'm certifiable.
I'm really sorry, okay?

48:51.220 --> 48:52.220
Oh, boy.

48:53.639 --> 48:55.119
Ray, do you mind
if I have a doughnut.

49:03.023 --> 49:04.023
Thanks.

49:06.819 --> 49:07.819
Okay, look.

49:08.112 --> 49:10.194
I am really flattered
that you asked me out,

49:10.990 --> 49:13.550
but, I mean, I can't accept
because I am involved with David, and

49:13.826 --> 49:14.928
well, I haven't
seen any evidence

49:14.952 --> 49:17.159
that he treats old people,
children, or dogs badly.

49:17.580 --> 49:18.945
Look, I admit, and I'm sorry.

49:19.123 --> 49:21.268
I guess I got a little carried away
with the David thing.

49:21.292 --> 49:22.686
I just should have
laid up and made my par.

49:22.710 --> 49:25.668
Okay, look, Roy, I j... I just want
to make a proposal, all right?

49:27.465 --> 49:30.081
I mean, as long as you understand
that it's strictly professional,

49:30.259 --> 49:32.420
and that, you know,
we're not going out together.

49:32.636 --> 49:33.636
Tee it up.

49:34.513 --> 49:37.755
Well, I think that I can help you
with the mental aspects of the game.

49:37.933 --> 49:40.299
I mean, you have, um,
Romeo to be your swing doctor.

49:40.478 --> 49:41.580
I could be your head doctor.

49:41.604 --> 49:42.604
What, Roy?

49:43.272 --> 49:45.638
Well, you just said yourself
you're a crummy shrink.

49:46.192 --> 49:47.978
Well, I can improve, Roy.

49:48.235 --> 49:50.567
Molly, I don't even have
the money to pay you.

49:51.322 --> 49:53.425
- I'm broke.
- Roy, you don't need any money to pay me.

49:53.449 --> 49:54.689
We'll trade services.

49:56.243 --> 49:59.735
I mean, you know, I'll give you
my services for golf lessons, and...

50:00.080 --> 50:02.696
And I can help you through
the qualifying, Roy,

50:03.959 --> 50:05.915
and then if you make it
into the open, well...

50:06.587 --> 50:09.078
I'm on my own.
You'll be with David.

50:12.551 --> 50:13.551
Yeah.

50:17.598 --> 50:19.839
Uh, I don't... I don't...
I don't really want this.

50:21.018 --> 50:22.018
Okay.

50:26.023 --> 50:27.308
J every minute j

50:28.984 --> 50:29.689
third in the group,

50:29.860 --> 50:32.146
playing out of salome, Texas,
Roy mcavoy.

50:32.321 --> 50:36.234
J every day that passes by j

50:38.035 --> 50:39.696
j fills my spirit j

50:41.080 --> 50:43.116
I for a moment j

50:44.458 --> 50:47.825
j that you're not on my mind j

50:50.548 --> 50:52.163
j if you wonder j;

50:53.425 --> 50:55.256
j when I think of you j

50:56.679 --> 51:00.638
j well, just let me
put it this way j

51:02.476 --> 51:03.932
j every minute j

51:06.272 --> 51:07.933
Ben hogan. Now, who's he?

51:08.607 --> 51:10.768
I find him mildly attractive

51:10.943 --> 51:12.774
when he's obnoxious
and arrogant like this.

51:13.112 --> 51:14.112
Well, good.

51:17.866 --> 51:19.857
J every hour j

51:21.078 --> 51:25.242
j every day j

51:25.416 --> 51:27.102
these guys bugging you,
boss? I can shut 'em up.

51:27.126 --> 51:27.865
The way I'm swinging today,

51:28.043 --> 51:30.659
nothing bugs me except
insufficient applause.

51:32.298 --> 51:33.413
Gimme the lumber.

51:33.799 --> 51:35.539
Eh, I think you wanna hit
the 2-iron, boss.

51:37.177 --> 51:38.508
I said I want the big dog.

51:39.888 --> 51:42.408
You got a tight par-5 here, man,
with out of bounds on the left.

51:42.766 --> 51:45.036
I don't think you wanna hit the driver.
The 2-iron seems like the deal.

51:45.060 --> 51:47.821
Well, I'm not goin' left of those trees
or right of those trees. Okay?

51:48.188 --> 51:49.519
I'm goin' over those trees...

51:50.274 --> 51:51.274
With a little draw.

51:51.317 --> 51:52.682
Yeah. = over the trees!

51:53.027 --> 51:54.142
That way, I get home in 2.

51:54.361 --> 51:55.881
That way, I'm puttin'
for eagle. Now...

51:56.905 --> 51:58.361
You don't need a eagle
to qualify.

51:59.116 --> 52:00.697
You need to practice
playin' it safe.

52:00.993 --> 52:03.179
- No mistakes with the...
- Qualify? I want the course record.

52:03.203 --> 52:04.283
Now give me the lumber.

52:08.083 --> 52:09.603
You're not gonna
listen to me, are you?

52:10.878 --> 52:12.869
Even when I'm tryin'
to help you, man.

52:14.423 --> 52:16.318
After all these years, what,
do you think I'm full of shit?

52:16.342 --> 52:18.028
I think I'm gonna get
penalized for slow play.

52:18.052 --> 52:19.462
Now gimme the fuckin' driver.

52:19.803 --> 52:21.406
You know, man,
you're a head case, you know?

52:21.430 --> 52:23.421
You always have been,
and you always will be.

52:23.599 --> 52:24.879
Well, let's ask the head doctor.

52:25.184 --> 52:26.411
- Dr. griswold?
- What do I say?

52:26.435 --> 52:27.435
Dr. griswold.

52:28.646 --> 52:29.180
Yes?

52:29.355 --> 52:31.141
Should I hit
the big dog or the 2?

52:32.024 --> 52:35.016
Uh, soliciting shot selection advice
is a 2-stroke penalty.

52:36.028 --> 52:37.268
Trust your feelings.

52:37.529 --> 52:39.895
Ha! Now, gimme the driver
and shut up.

52:43.702 --> 52:45.488
You want the driver? Fine.

52:46.038 --> 52:47.038
Here.

52:48.207 --> 52:49.807
Hit the driver, tin cup.

52:55.756 --> 52:57.667
Well, I've changed my mind.
Give me the 3-wood.

52:59.301 --> 53:01.141
You can't throw that dogleg
with a 3-wood, man.

53:01.887 --> 53:02.887
You wanha bet?

53:05.349 --> 53:07.010
Fine. Take the 3-wood.

53:07.184 --> 53:07.889
Take it and show me

53:08.060 --> 53:09.846
what a golf pro does, man.

53:16.318 --> 53:18.058
Guess I'm goin' with
the safe shot, boys.

53:21.240 --> 53:23.447
But, you know,
sometimes I fan that 2.

53:24.284 --> 53:25.444
Ooo.

53:25.869 --> 53:27.869
You better gimme the 3.

53:28.706 --> 53:30.287
Is this normal behavior for him?

53:30.541 --> 53:31.768
Well, the word "normal" and him

53:31.792 --> 53:33.828
don't often collide
in the same sentence.

53:36.630 --> 53:39.542
And sometimes
I catch that 3 a little thin, too.

53:40.426 --> 53:42.506
Don't do this, Roy.
= and I've hit fliers with the 4.

53:43.762 --> 53:44.592
Hit the damn ball, Roy.

53:44.763 --> 53:49.052
Hmm? I've hooked my 5.
I've shanked the 6.

53:49.351 --> 53:51.558
Skulled the 8. Fatted the 9.

53:51.979 --> 53:53.264
Chili-dipped the wedge.

53:54.148 --> 53:55.638
And I've bladed the sand.

53:56.984 --> 53:58.099
Putter? = yeah.

53:59.069 --> 54:01.185
There is old Mr. 3-wiggle,
isn't there?

54:02.406 --> 54:03.406
Jj

54:06.618 --> 54:08.074
But then there's the 7-iron.

54:09.329 --> 54:11.160
I never miss with the 7-iron.

54:14.626 --> 54:16.036
Jj

54:16.211 --> 54:18.452
It's the only
truly safe club in my bag.

54:21.175 --> 54:23.040
Well, the bag's lighter, Romeo.
You happy?

54:24.052 --> 54:25.258
No, I'm not happy, man.

54:26.430 --> 54:27.430
I'm tired...

54:29.266 --> 54:31.536
And my life's too short
to sit there watch you blow up all the...

54:31.560 --> 54:33.425
'Cause I done it too many times.

54:34.980 --> 54:35.980
What, are you quittin'?

54:36.064 --> 54:39.181
Huh. God... damn.

54:39.693 --> 54:41.684
First sign of adversity,
and you're quittin'?

54:42.446 --> 54:44.277
God. First time
you have a chance

54:44.448 --> 54:45.688
to qualify for the open.

54:45.866 --> 54:47.777
Jesus, what the hell
is wrong with you?

54:50.162 --> 54:53.700
Anybody wanna bet me
I can't par in with a 7-iron? Huh?

54:54.374 --> 54:55.659
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

54:56.168 --> 54:57.168
Come on, anybody?

54:58.128 --> 54:59.743
No, sir. No way.

55:02.132 --> 55:03.542
Doc, take the bet.

55:03.717 --> 55:05.673
Roy, just shut up
and hit the ball.

55:05.969 --> 55:09.757
Jj

55:12.434 --> 55:13.434
Okay.

55:28.242 --> 55:29.322
You the man, cup.

55:32.496 --> 55:34.157
J it's pride against money j

55:36.083 --> 55:37.744
j love against pride j

55:38.961 --> 55:40.917
j drivin' all the demons j

55:41.964 --> 55:44.171
j that I been keepin' inside j

55:45.008 --> 55:47.590
j I always
go for the long shot j

55:48.053 --> 55:50.510
I I never hesitate j

55:51.473 --> 55:54.089
j when I wave
to the four winds j

55:54.309 --> 55:57.267
j I stick a finger at fate j

55:57.688 --> 56:00.475
j it's just a character flaw j

56:00.732 --> 56:03.724
j no matter what you saw,
it don't matter at all j

56:03.902 --> 56:06.689
j it's just a character flaw j

56:07.072 --> 56:10.109
j it ain't against the law,
it don't matter at all j

56:10.284 --> 56:12.366
j it's just a character flaw j

56:14.329 --> 56:15.535
thank you, boys.

56:15.706 --> 56:16.786
You survived?

56:17.207 --> 56:18.207
Whoo!

56:18.709 --> 56:19.709
Cervezas?

56:19.877 --> 56:21.162
Si, cervezas.

56:22.170 --> 56:23.580
What do you think
my best shot was?

56:23.881 --> 56:25.337
Was it the 7-iron on 12?

56:25.507 --> 56:26.713
Pretty good one.

56:26.884 --> 56:28.215
Or was it the 7-iron on 14?

56:28.385 --> 56:28.965
That was tight.

56:29.136 --> 56:29.795
That was better.

56:29.970 --> 56:31.335
What about that
bunker shot on 18,

56:31.513 --> 56:34.505
which, to my recollection,
was a 7-iron?

56:34.683 --> 56:36.264
Yes, it was.

56:36.435 --> 56:37.475
They all were good.

56:37.769 --> 56:38.997
- You're definitely the man.
- Hoo.

56:39.021 --> 56:40.807
Hey, doc. Doc.

56:41.064 --> 56:41.723
Hmm?

56:41.940 --> 56:42.940
How'd I do?

56:43.483 --> 56:45.644
Well, you failed miserably, Roy.

56:46.069 --> 56:47.629
W-what are you
talkin' about? I...

56:47.821 --> 56:49.777
Did I not qualify
for the sectionals?

56:51.033 --> 56:53.695
I believe I did,
with a 7-iron, I recall.

56:54.620 --> 56:58.238
Look, your job
isn't just to qualify for the open.

56:58.957 --> 57:00.572
It's to prepare for the open.

57:00.751 --> 57:02.958
My job is to help you prepare.

57:03.253 --> 57:03.912
Thank you.

57:04.087 --> 57:06.123
Now, you said trust my feelings.
I did.

57:07.299 --> 57:10.403
Well, I didn't know you felt
like breakin' all the clubs in your bag

57:10.427 --> 57:12.509
and getting in a pissing contest
with your caddy,

57:12.804 --> 57:13.919
who, incidentally, quit.

57:14.097 --> 57:16.053
Well, he always quits.

57:16.767 --> 57:18.257
He ought to be here, manana.

57:18.435 --> 57:19.094
To the quitter.

57:19.269 --> 57:20.269
To Rome.

57:20.312 --> 57:21.539
Romeo. Romeo.

57:21.563 --> 57:22.678
Yeah, the little quitter.

57:22.856 --> 57:24.812
Nonetheless, nonetheless...

57:25.943 --> 57:28.400
From the mental aspect,
which is my domain,

57:29.279 --> 57:30.439
you've regressed, Roy...

57:30.739 --> 57:31.398
Oh.

57:31.615 --> 57:34.357
And are fumbling somewhere
between delusion and denial.

57:34.534 --> 57:35.637
Regression. Delusion. Denial.

57:35.661 --> 57:39.028
I mean, why you gotta use all
the psychological language for?

57:40.874 --> 57:42.080
Havin' a bad day, Roy?

57:44.086 --> 57:45.086
No.

57:45.170 --> 57:45.829
Hi, honey.

57:46.004 --> 57:47.004
Hi, darlin'.

57:49.716 --> 57:50.716
Shot a 65.

57:52.344 --> 57:54.084
Parred the backside
with a 7-iron.

57:55.180 --> 57:55.760
Why?

57:56.181 --> 57:58.661
Yeah, that's exactly right.
Now, see, that's the question. Why?

57:58.934 --> 58:00.845
Because he broke
all of his other clubs.

58:02.437 --> 58:03.437
Snapped 'em right in two.

58:04.439 --> 58:07.556
Jesus, Roy.
=I didn't break 'em all. Romeo broke two.

58:10.570 --> 58:13.653
Listen, I'm on your side here.
I mean, we go way back, partner,

58:14.157 --> 58:16.990
and I really hope you
qualify for the open, but if you do...

58:17.577 --> 58:19.738
You better play with
some kind of control, son,

58:20.163 --> 58:21.653
or you'll get
slaughtered out there.

58:22.541 --> 58:24.998
Hell, good players
shoot an 82 in the open.

58:26.211 --> 58:30.170
You see, Roy, it means
you just can't always go for it.

58:30.674 --> 58:34.667
I swear to god, doc,
this guy is not who you think he is.

58:34.845 --> 58:37.052
Well, it's a well-known fact.
If a camera's not on him,

58:37.222 --> 58:39.258
he treats old people
and children like dirt.

58:39.516 --> 58:40.516
And dogs.

58:41.059 --> 58:42.139
Jeez...

58:42.394 --> 58:43.634
Yeah, don't forget dogs.

58:43.812 --> 58:46.679
Okay. Okay, guys. You know what?
We better go, David.

58:47.024 --> 58:48.024
Ugh, come on.

58:48.442 --> 58:49.442
Yeah, I guess so.

58:49.776 --> 58:50.776
Come on.

58:51.695 --> 58:53.686
Hey, you ever shoot par
with a 7-iron?

58:56.783 --> 58:58.193
Why, hell, Roy, it...

58:58.535 --> 59:00.446
Never even occurred
to me to try.

59:02.080 --> 59:03.991
Well, I bet you $1,000
against my car

59:04.166 --> 59:06.122
that I can beat you
in any game...

59:08.045 --> 59:09.876
Any game...
You name it, with a golf club.

59:11.715 --> 59:13.797
Come on, Roy,
this is ridiculous.

59:14.176 --> 59:15.176
What, are ya chicken?

59:21.767 --> 59:25.259
What, are you gonna... gonna lay up
the way you did in the masters last year?

59:25.812 --> 59:27.768
Ooh!

59:35.155 --> 59:36.155
Any game, I name it?

59:36.198 --> 59:37.467
- Oh, David, come on.
- Any game.

59:37.491 --> 59:40.654
Oh, no, no, it's okay. I'm just
gonna teach old Roy here a little lesson.

59:41.703 --> 59:44.285
Why do men insist on
measuring their dicks?

59:49.753 --> 59:51.118
All right, let's measure.

59:52.339 --> 59:54.400
- Fine. Let's measure.
- Oh, Roy, for god's sakes,

59:54.424 --> 59:55.539
I wasn't being literal.

59:56.802 --> 59:58.212
Oh, David, come on, let's go.

59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.464
Wait, wait, wait, Molly,
I got this one.

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:04.848
We'll just call this part of
Roy's mental preparation for the us open,

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:08.970
where the rough is deep and the Greens
are slick and nerves are shattered.

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:11.023
I'll take the bet.

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:11.896
Oh, Jesus.

01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:12.601
- Yes!
- Yes.

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:13.811
All right!

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.565
What's the... what's the game?

01:00:18.323 --> 01:00:19.938
Your 7-iron, Roy.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:23.035
One swing each,

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:25.194
whoever hits it the longest.

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:27.873
That's a lock.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:30.958
I hit the 7-iron
like John daly hits the three.

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:33.174
Winner, winner, chicken dinner!

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:35.537
Who'll take my beer? Curt?

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:36.966
Thank you.

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:39.677
Right here okay?

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:41.053
Fine with me.

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:44.713
You know, you guys
are really being childish.

01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:46.347
Leave this one to me, darlin'.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.053
I know what I'm doin', too.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:51.053
You know what?
I'll see you both in the bar.

01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:52.231
Bye.

01:00:57.028 --> 01:00:58.143
Dollar bills.

01:01:04.452 --> 01:01:06.909
Hey, them signs
are at least 30 yards further.

01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:09.780
Hey, Earl, that ball
must've gone 220.

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:12.407
Nah, 227.

01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:14.534
Toed her a bit, but it'll do.

01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:19.793
Fine with me.

01:01:21.136 --> 01:01:23.377
No, that's all right.
I don't need to.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:26.429
Well, uh, take your jacket off.

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:28.093
No. No, I'm fine.

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:31.210
You're gonna have to muscle up,
big guy, to get it out there.

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:33.978
Gotta give it the old...
Steroid jerk.

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:38.944
Yeah.

01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:43.562
What the hell's he doin'?

01:02:00.592 --> 01:02:02.298
Jj

01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:03.469
Hmm...

01:02:05.639 --> 01:02:07.879
Shit, he hit it
down the fuckin' road, didn't he?

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:09.969
Still goin'.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:13.309
Jj

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:24.021
Uh, you the man, Roy.
You the man.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:26.656
Oh, yeah. You are
definitely the man.

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:29.745
So long, bucko.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:32.905
The man needs a ride home.

01:02:36.044 --> 01:02:37.044
Mm-mmm.

01:02:39.798 --> 01:02:41.038
I always liked that car.

01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:48.420
J it's early Sunday mornin'rl

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:50.513
j the sun is coming up j

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:52.723

j but I'll give it
my best shot... l

01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:03.314
god, I wish Romeo were here.
I'm not cut out for this shit.

01:03:03.822 --> 01:03:06.234
I'm an observer by nature.
I'm a spectator.

01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:07.568
- Earl, shut up.
- Okay.

01:03:07.742 --> 01:03:08.822
Gimme the big dog.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:10.786
Big dog.

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:12.910
I thought that was
the fucking big dog.

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:16.163
J help me keep my head down j

01:03:16.334 --> 01:03:19.121

J first, I pull out my driver

01:03:34.853 --> 01:03:36.809
j I checked my stance and grip j

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.811
j I'm tryin' to remember

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:47.020
No.

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:48.688
J keep your head
behind the ball j

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:50.403
j and look out for those trees j

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:51.783

You all right?

01:03:58.501 --> 01:03:59.501
Aw, shit.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:02.004
Here, give me the bag.

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:03.505
Nah.

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.289
- All right.
- Okay.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:10.005
Dewey, take him in.

01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:12.553
Jj

01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:20.645
Come on, like a million others
you made in your life, Roy.

01:04:22.317 --> 01:04:23.807
Just see it goin' in.

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:26.403
Just feel it.

01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:29.278
Right in the back of the jar.

01:04:36.956 --> 01:04:39.163
J well, I started out
with three balls I

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:41.450

Man, you should've been there.

01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:23.075
I drained a 30-foot snake
to qualify.

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:24.939
Earl gives me
this straight read.

01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:27.124
Thing breaks half a dozen times.

01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:31.588
Ah, missed ya, pods. I missed ya.

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:36.220
Okay, don't talk to me,
but you're still my guy.

01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:40.975
Look, it's a little late
to be pissed off.

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:43.728
I mean, we're in the open,
you and me.

01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:48.311
All right, fine, be like that.

01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:51.017
Say, has Molly been around?

01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:54.565
You know what? Neither her
nor me nor the god of golf himself

01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:56.733
is gonna keep you
from blowin' up in the open.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:58.906
Well, I made it this far,
didn't 1?

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.080
Didn't 1? Didn't 1?

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:03.081
All I gotta do is hold it together
for 72 more holes.

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:07.289
There's a lot of triple bogeys waiting
out there to grab your skinny white ass.

01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:10.334
Are you complainin' again?
Is that... is that what I hear?

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:11.569
- Shut up.
- Are you complaining again?

01:06:11.593 --> 01:06:13.754
You're back,
whinin' and bitchin',

01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:17.591
pissin' and moanin'.
You're back! Huh? You're my man.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.761
You didn't fall in love
with Earl to be your caddy?

01:06:21.186 --> 01:06:21.720
Oh, Earl.

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:24.136
Jeez, he's a wheezin' heart attack
waitin' to happen.

01:06:24.772 --> 01:06:26.353
Cost me 3 strokes a side.

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:29.766
Hell, I had to carry the bag
the last 4 holes.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:38.324
Look, I love old Earl,
okay, but I need you.

01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:41.288
You don't love me?

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:46.123
Well, yeah.
Yeah, I love you, too, god damn it.

01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:48.452
Well, as much as Earl?

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.745
I don't know. I mean...

01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:53.756
When I was with Earl,
I was thinkin' of you.

01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:56.005
Yes, uh...

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:58.927
As much as Earl.

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:01.099
More than Earl.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:04.304
More than Earl.

01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:07.064
Am I special?

01:07:10.735 --> 01:07:12.726
Well, if you can remove
the sexual overtones

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:15.190
in that, uh, golf theme,
then, Romeo...

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:17.022
I am your Juliet.

01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:23.866
In that case, Julieta...

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:26.615
I am your caddy onhe more time.

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:37.667
So nobody's heard
from Molly, huh?

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:39.335
You got it bad, huh?

01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:41.424
Somethin' about that chick.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:43.719
Somethin' about that chick.

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:48.723
Little chili-Dipper there.

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:50.751
Hey, be sure
to do that in the open.

01:07:50.775 --> 01:07:51.775
It really impresses 'em.

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:01.785
Rome...

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.120
Yeah, I'm watchin'.

01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:04.451
That ain't no chili-Dipper.

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:07.622
Looks like you got El hosel.
The laterals.

01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:09.376
You know, the "s" word?

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:10.836
What am I doin' wrong?

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:12.690
I don't know.
The shanks are like a virus.

01:08:12.714 --> 01:08:13.714
They just show up.

01:08:14.132 --> 01:08:15.452
Nobody can figure 'em out.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.640
Romes...

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:25.548
Yeah.

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:27.175
Somethin's terribly wrong.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:29.515
Rome, somethin's wrong.

01:08:29.814 --> 01:08:30.974
That's okay.

01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:34.148
Well? Well, what's your guess?

01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:36.143
It's gotta be the woman.

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:38.006
I thought you said
it was a virus.

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:40.898
Well, a woman can have
the same effect.

01:08:41.908 --> 01:08:43.694
What, uh, what do I do?

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:47.946
Um... j-just keep swingin'.

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:49.781
Go on. You're fine.

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:00.375
Don't say a fuckin' word.

01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:09.350
Um, I'm inside if you need me.

01:09:21.532 --> 01:09:22.817
Just work it out.

01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:29.370
Jj

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:46.380
Jj

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.227
Hello? Is anybody home?

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.447
My god... Roy.

01:10:09.622 --> 01:10:10.622
Dr. griswold.

01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:15.662
The therapist laughs
at the patient?

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:18.165
Huh? Is that how it works?

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:20.048
Is that how it works?

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:22.044
- No.
- Man's laid bare before god,

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.174
he's the butt of a cosmic joke?

01:10:24.512 --> 01:10:26.628
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.426
Some of this shit might actually work,
you know. I mean...

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:32.008
I think there's somethin'
to this hat,

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:34.594
the golf ball pendulum thing.

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:37.225
Could be onto somethin' here.

01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:38.932
Oh, Jesus, Roy.

01:10:39.777 --> 01:10:40.937
I mean, quoting yourself,

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:44.570
it is paraphernalia for lost
and desperate souls.

01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:49.071
Well, a lost and desperate soul
stands before you.

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:53.029
I assume I have
the confidentiality

01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:54.538
of the doctor-client...

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:57.082
Privilege in regards
to this outfit.

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:59.744
Of course you do.
Now, what happened?

01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:04.215
Well... l got the shanks.

01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:06.084
Are you taking penicillin?

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:08.048
There's a glitch in my swing.

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:10.053
Well, that's Romeo's department.

01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:13.887
No, he thinks it's your department.
Says it's a head thing.

01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:17.519
Oh. Well, uh, I just came over

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:21.808
to congratulate you on the, um,
sectionals and to return your car.

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:23.130
I mean, David said
he doesn't want it.

01:11:23.154 --> 01:11:26.396
Just wanted to make a point.
You know what, Roy? Look.

01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:30.366
You know what? I suppose that
we could have a therapy session

01:11:30.536 --> 01:11:31.742
right here and now.

01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:35.784
I don't want therapy, okay?

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:38.331
I want you.

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:44.626
I want you.

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:47.425
I gotta get some air, Roy.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:48.720
Molly...

01:11:50.097 --> 01:11:51.633
Molly. Molly, wait.

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:54.724
Molly, look at me.

01:11:58.397 --> 01:12:01.230
Well, not at the moment,
but just listen to me.

01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:07.190
You're with the wrong guy.

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:09.481
I'm the right guy.

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:15.028
I mean everyone... everyone says
my face is screwed up tight as a drum.

01:12:15.706 --> 01:12:18.493
I know it's 'cause
I been crazy about you

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.249
from the moment you came here,

01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:22.099
when you were wearin'
all this stupid shit.

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:25.442
The whole damn thing's
both inspired me to get here

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:27.923
and also 'caused me
to get the shanks,

01:12:28.135 --> 01:12:30.672
which could humiliate me
in front of a billion, zillion people

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:34.010
in a game I used to... used to
know how to play pretty good.

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:37.141
Such is life.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.896
So dump that phony bastard
you're with

01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:45.058
and come to the open
in my corner, okay?

01:12:46.404 --> 01:12:49.362
Tell me...
Tell me you're not just like at least

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.364
moderately attracted to me.

01:12:53.661 --> 01:12:55.697
You have moments, Roy.

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:57.766
Yeah? Well, you tell me
which ones are my moments,

01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:59.326
and I'll try and duplicate them.

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:01.543
This is a moment.

01:13:01.752 --> 01:13:02.752
Now?

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.162
Yeah. I mean,
just utterly exposed,

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:07.622
completely vulnerable,

01:13:07.842 --> 01:13:09.173
inner child trying to get out.

01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:11.959
Yeah? My inner child
needs a spankin'?

01:13:12.138 --> 01:13:14.299
Yeah. No, Roy. No, Roy.

01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:18.935
Oh.

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:22.645
I, uh, don't have a car.

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:24.806
Need a ride.

01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:26.937
I know.

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:36.821
J you're like a cool breeze... j

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:37.576
Roy...

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:39.362
J to a hot spell... j

01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:43.328
I know a spot
along the river, it's...

01:13:44.378 --> 01:13:46.619
It's great to watch sunsets.
Ll do.

01:13:46.797 --> 01:13:47.456
Watch the road.

01:13:47.632 --> 01:13:49.359
I know a spot by the river
that's great for sunsets.

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:52.216
I bet you do, Roy. Not tonight.

01:13:54.388 --> 01:13:56.344
Not tonight means
maybe some other night.

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:58.089
No, I didn't mean it like that.

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:00.078
Maybe consciously
you didn't mean it that way,

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:01.512
but how about unconsciously?

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:03.790
Come on, you're the expert.

01:14:03.814 --> 01:14:05.054
Did you mean it unconsciously?

01:14:05.232 --> 01:14:09.441
Roy, unconsciously, I don't have a clue
what I'm talkin' about.

01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:12.566
I feel we're makin' progress.

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:14.070
Well, I do, too.

01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:17.776
I have no idea what it's
progress towards, though. None.

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:20.740
Consciously or unconsciously?

01:14:21.082 --> 01:14:22.322
Oh, Roy.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:26.368
J you're like a sweet spot
to these tired eyes j

01:14:26.671 --> 01:14:30.505
j you're like the last mile
on a long ride I

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:33.041
I till the end of time j

01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:35.130
j baby, I can start j

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:39.138
j if you just let me
into your heart j

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:41.890
well, it may not be much of a river
to you, but to me it's the...

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:45.515
Mississippi,
the rio grande, the...

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:49.106
The danube, the Amazon...

01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:52.143
Wow, the Amazon?
I don't know about the Amazon, Roy.

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:58.860
[Scoffs[I come on, Molly. I mean, isn't it
obvious to you that you and me are...

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:02.408
As comfortable together
as a couple of old shoes?

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:06.541
Old shoes? Oh, Roy.

01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:12.668
Look, David... David's
a really good person.

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:18.294
Whenever anybody says
they're with a really good person,

01:15:18.472 --> 01:15:19.472
it means they're...

01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:21.840
It means they're about to leave 'em.

01:15:22.727 --> 01:15:24.467
You know, you're
awfully judgmental.

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:26.187
Well...

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.607
It's one of my few
redeeming virtues.

01:15:34.488 --> 01:15:36.854
You know, look, David's involved
in a lot of charity work.

01:15:37.074 --> 01:15:38.135
Gets his name in the paper.

01:15:38.159 --> 01:15:40.150
No. Roy, no. Let me just finish.

01:15:40.327 --> 01:15:43.088
I mean I... he's a sensitive person,
and a lot of people don't see it.

01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:44.524
Well, so am I.
I mean, hell, I'm...

01:15:45.249 --> 01:15:47.490
Shit, I'm twice
as sensitive as he is.

01:15:48.002 --> 01:15:51.494
I mean, I... hell, I brought you
to the river. I mean, that's a...

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:53.774
That's a nature
kind of thing, isn't it?

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:57.007
Yeah, it is a nature
kind of thing, Roy.

01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:59.339
It is a very nice river.
Thank you.

01:16:00.681 --> 01:16:01.681
But that's not the point.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:03.763
The point is
is that David is there for me.

01:16:04.185 --> 01:16:08.519
Oh, god. Not the
"he's a very good person

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:10.395
and he's there for me thing."
I mean...

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:11.918
L-let me be your shrink
for a minute.

01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:13.422
You know what,
that's not a good idea.

01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:16.314
You're startin' to sound like a woman
who's lookin' for a way out.

01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:21.493
Warm?

01:16:23.788 --> 01:16:24.868
That's enough, Roy.

01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:29.783
Okay. I'm sorry.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:47.883
- We could kiss.
- Oh, jeez, Roy.

01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:49.677
Look, no harm, no foul.

01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:51.937
Just a little, small, innocent,

01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:56.272
you know, kind of...
Kind of a... semi...

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:58.235
Platonic.

01:16:58.405 --> 01:16:59.405
Roy...

01:17:03.077 --> 01:17:05.534
Roy, there's no such thing as

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:07.536
semi-platonic, Roy.

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:10.792
There ought to be.

01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:16.837
I think you better take me home.

01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:36.269
Jj

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:48.323
Well, good luck
in the open, Roy.

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:09.131
J when I was younger,
I believed j

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:12.305
j that dreams came true j

01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:15.513
j now I wonder

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.813
j 'cause I've seen
much more dark skies j

01:18:20.154 --> 01:18:21.940
I than of blue

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:24.730
j now I wonder

01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:29.910
j I keep on prayin'
for blue skies j

01:18:31.665 --> 01:18:34.953
j I keep on thinkin'
of the good times j

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:39.663
j will they ever come again? J

01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:42.502
j now I wonder

01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:47.590
jj

01:18:56.023 --> 01:19:00.107
J will they ever come again? J

01:19:00.527 --> 01:19:02.643
j now I wonder

01:19:05.491 --> 01:19:07.652
j oh, I wonder j

01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:34.133
Jj

01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:47.842
It's got your name on it, man.

01:19:47.866 --> 01:19:49.469
Wow, they spelled it right
and everything.

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:51.779
Hey, look, it's Lee janzen
and Billy Mayfair, man.

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:55.659
They look just like
they do on TV.

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:56.956
Look at these balls.

01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:02.795
Look at these balls.
Brand-new titleist.

01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:03.670
Brand-new?

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:06.207
Look at 'em.
Every one of them, brand-new titleist.

01:20:06.385 --> 01:20:07.385
Whoa.

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:08.793
Jeez.

01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:10.836
Sneak a few in the bag
when you get a chance.

01:20:11.432 --> 01:20:14.720
We swipe enough free shit,
we might even pay for this fiasco.

01:20:15.936 --> 01:20:17.747
Do you think it would
be inappropriate

01:20:17.771 --> 01:20:19.331
if I asked Lee janzen
for his autograph?

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:21.226
I think that's
a dead giveaway, romes,

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.600
but if I still got the shanks,

01:20:22.693 --> 01:20:24.133
we're gonna be
found out soon enough.

01:20:25.446 --> 01:20:28.529
Oh. Hit the 7.
You always hit that good.

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:30.405
Good thinkin', pods.

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:32.734
Sweet swing. Come on, man.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:35.850
Keep your head down
and follow through.

01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:37.058
You're makin' me nervous.

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:38.082
All right.

01:20:42.212 --> 01:20:43.212
Whoa! Hey

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:45.462
- who hit that shot?
- Yeah, who hit that?

01:20:45.799 --> 01:20:47.068
- Anybody see?
- Watch out.

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:48.372
There's supposed
to be pros here.

01:20:49.219 --> 01:20:50.530
A little thin, boss.

01:20:50.554 --> 01:20:51.634
Little fucking thin.

01:20:51.805 --> 01:20:53.341
Jesus Christ,
I still got the shanks.

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:54.345
Don't worry about it, man.

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:55.346
Everybody's watchin' me.

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:56.517
Nobody's watchin'.

01:20:56.727 --> 01:20:58.580
Just hit another one.
Come on, just stand up there, man.

01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:00.164
- You can do it. All right.
- All right.

01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:12.113
- Whoa.
- Look out!

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:13.284
Ho!

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:16.330
Hey, partner, uh, you know,
the guys down the line

01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:17.515
are a little concerned
about that.

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:18.324
What's your name? Tin cup?

01:21:18.499 --> 01:21:19.989
Yeah, Roy mcavoy
from west Texas.

01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:21.186
We're, uh, from west Texas.

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:22.970
Uh, why don't you try
aiming a little left...

01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:25.494
Why don't you try backing up,
giving me just a little room?

01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:31.321
Hey, man, that's Johnny Miller.

01:21:31.345 --> 01:21:32.881
Don't give
a flying fuck who it is.

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:34.386
Jesus, cup.

01:21:35.182 --> 01:21:36.182
He can't do that.

01:21:36.266 --> 01:21:37.786
Hey, no problem.
Who do you want it to?

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:40.134
To Romeo. To Romeo, uh...
My best friend.

01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:42.307
- Ooh!
- Well, good luck to you, guys.

01:21:42.815 --> 01:21:45.251
You might want to make
some plane reservations Friday, though.

01:21:45.275 --> 01:21:47.395
Okay, thanks, Mr. Miller.
Hey, great open in '73, boy.

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:48.630
Okay, thank you.

01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:50.734
- What a nice guy.
- Yeah. Did you get his autograph?

01:21:50.823 --> 01:21:52.484
Yeah. Look.
"To my best friend, Romeo."

01:21:52.658 --> 01:21:53.885
- Do you see who's over there?
- What?

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:56.651
- Jesus Christ.
- It's only an autograph, man.

01:21:57.579 --> 01:21:58.785
Simms is here.

01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:04.742
Aw, shit.
Maybe you should hit your putter.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:05.920
You can't shank that one.

01:22:05.963 --> 01:22:07.403
Look, you're the Mexican
Mac o'Grady.

01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:09.442
You gotta figure out
why I'm still shanking the ball.

01:22:09.466 --> 01:22:10.735
- You know.
- What's the problem?

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:11.759
Oh, shoot.

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:13.154
I'm catching
on the hosel, right?

01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:14.338
Yeah, right, right, right.

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.003
Moving my head? = yeah.

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:18.463
- I'm laying it off?
- Well, that, too.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:19.851
I'm pronating.

01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:21.079
When you're not supinating.

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:22.934
I'm clearing too early,
I'm clearing too late.

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:26.017
My god, my swing feels like
an unfolding lawn chair!

01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:27.692
All right.

01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:31.935
Take all your change
and put it in your left-hand pocket.

01:22:32.489 --> 01:22:33.148
Go on, do it, Roy.

01:22:33.323 --> 01:22:34.323
All right.

01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:40.865
All right, now...
Tie your left shoe in a double knot.

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:43.454
- Tie my left shoe...
- Right now, Roy! Do it!

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:52.206
Turn your hat around backwards.

01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:54.587
Turn your hat around!
Do it, Roy!

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:01.507
Now take this tee
and stick it...

01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:03.888
Behind your left ear.

01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:07.896
Stick it... I look like a fool!

01:23:08.192 --> 01:23:09.627
Well, what the hell
do you think you look like

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:11.858
shooting them chili peppers
up Lee janzen's ass?

01:23:14.281 --> 01:23:15.300
Now, you do it right now, Roy,

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:16.644
or I swear to god,
I'm gonna quit.

01:23:16.783 --> 01:23:18.383
- I swear to god, I'll quit.
- All right.

01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:20.745
All right, good.

01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:22.451
Now take this little ball,

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:24.287
hit it the hell up the fairway.

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:25.833
You're ready.

01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:41.724
How'd I do that?

01:23:41.975 --> 01:23:43.806
'Cause you're not
thinking about shanking.

01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:45.847
You're not thinking
about the doctor lady.

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:47.141
You're not thinking, period!

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:48.888
You're just looking like a fool.

01:23:49.191 --> 01:23:50.752
And you're hitting the ball
pure and simple,

01:23:50.776 --> 01:23:52.212
- and that's your natural...
- Fuck you.

01:23:52.236 --> 01:23:54.898
Fuck me, huh?
Well, you're cured.

01:23:56.657 --> 01:23:57.692
I'm c... that's it?

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:59.197
Yeah, that's it.

01:23:59.826 --> 01:24:01.566
Your brain was getting
in the way.

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:05.491
That's hardly ever
been the case, but...

01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:07.451
Well, no shit, Sherlock.

01:24:07.626 --> 01:24:08.626
Well, what next?

01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:11.535
Well... l should recommend

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:13.273
that you work on
your short game, but...

01:24:14.341 --> 01:24:15.541
I think you oughtta get drunk.

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:17.253
Get drunk? = yeah.

01:24:17.761 --> 01:24:19.401
You always play better
when you're wasted.

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:22.592
Remember brownsville?

01:24:25.269 --> 01:24:25.849
Come on, get it down.

01:24:26.019 --> 01:24:27.339
Come on, now.
What time I tee off?

01:24:27.437 --> 01:24:29.849
You tee off at 7:08.
We're the first guys going.

01:24:30.023 --> 01:24:32.435
- Come on, one more. Just do it.
- Hey.

01:24:32.609 --> 01:24:33.849
Let's go, come on. Get it down.

01:24:33.944 --> 01:24:34.649
That's 4 hours from now.

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:35.820
That's right.

01:24:40.117 --> 01:24:41.653
Here's to
the finely tuned athlete

01:24:41.827 --> 01:24:43.533
on the verge of greatness.

01:24:46.123 --> 01:24:47.123
Ail

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:56.254
Jj

01:24:58.343 --> 01:24:59.343
Hurry up, boss.

01:24:59.553 --> 01:25:00.553
Jj

01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:02.237
I knew we should've set an alarm.

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:06.765
With the honor
in the 7:08 pairing,

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:10.268
from salami, Texas,
Mr. Roy mcavoy.

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:12.854
Uh, any time for a quick bucket?

01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:14.191
Tee it up.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.110
Okay, boss.

01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:17.848
We almost missed
the starting time

01:25:17.904 --> 01:25:19.184
trying to get you off the floor.

01:25:19.489 --> 01:25:20.228
If I may say so,

01:25:20.407 --> 01:25:22.127
you don't handle the hooch
like you used to.

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.116
Oh, I've seen this hole on TV.

01:25:25.704 --> 01:25:27.181
Just hit the big dog
up the chute there.

01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:28.285
No. I've learned my lesson.

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:30.948
I'm gonna play it...
Safe, smart...

01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:33.169
Conservative.

01:25:34.379 --> 01:25:36.165
Fairways and Greens.
Hand me a 2-iron.

01:25:37.382 --> 01:25:38.382
You sure?

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:40.676
Yeah.

01:25:43.764 --> 01:25:44.764
Okay.

01:25:46.725 --> 01:25:47.725
Ohh.

01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:49.310
Uhh.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.560
Not a good day.

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.062
Be humble.

01:26:02.282 --> 01:26:03.112
Be humble.

01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:04.283
83.

01:26:05.202 --> 01:26:06.658
Well, you're humble now, homes.

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:08.245
I was hung over.

01:26:10.707 --> 01:26:12.143
Maybe that was
a coaching mistake on my part.

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:14.453
Yeah, maybe it was.
Thanks, amigo.

01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:17.632
David Simms
is the first-round leader

01:26:17.714 --> 01:26:20.376
at the us open
after a brilliant 67.

01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:21.819
Congratulations, David.

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:24.425
Well... Jim, I gotta tell you,

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:26.211
I'm the last guy on the planet

01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:29.006
that expected me to go out there
right out of the blocks

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:30.890
and shoot a 67 to lead the open.

01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:31.720
Shut up.

01:26:31.895 --> 01:26:32.509
I've really marveled

01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:34.724
at how you've been able
to balance the superb play

01:26:34.898 --> 01:26:37.480
with all the time
and energy you give to...

01:26:37.818 --> 01:26:40.104
To so many charities
and all of your fans, too.

01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:43.396
Well, you know, I...
This game is about...

01:26:44.116 --> 01:26:46.448
Tradition and... and
integrity and honor.

01:26:46.827 --> 01:26:49.569
You know,
the us open is... is it for us,

01:26:49.746 --> 01:26:51.626
so I'm just gonna go out there
tomorrow and, uh,

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:53.238
try and make
some good swings, and...

01:26:53.834 --> 01:26:56.746
Lord willing, I'll put up another
good number tomorrow.

01:26:57.003 --> 01:26:59.210
The antichrist shoots 67.

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:01.500
Believe that?

01:27:01.675 --> 01:27:04.462
Yeah, the old antichrist
had a hot putter today, boss.

01:27:05.262 --> 01:27:06.656
Thanks a lot, Jim.
It's good seeing you.

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:07.260
Yeah, it's great to see you.

01:27:07.431 --> 01:27:09.092
Hey, Luther. Be well, buddy.

01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:11.077
I'll see you out in the trenches.

01:27:11.101 --> 01:27:12.966
Mr. Simms! Mr. Simms!

01:27:13.145 --> 01:27:15.306
I gotta run right now,
but I'll see you later.

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:18.521
Christ almighty Jesus.

01:27:19.776 --> 01:27:21.141
No, it's either
cover or nothing.

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:23.231
They want you for usa weekend.

01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:25.133
We're telling them
it's either the cover or no go.

01:27:25.157 --> 01:27:26.693
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.781
Excuse me, Mr. Simms. Excuse me.

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:31.739
Would you mind giving our
grandson an autograph?

01:27:31.913 --> 01:27:33.558
Can I please have
your autograph, Mr. Simms?

01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:35.072
Can you people not see
that I'm busy?

01:27:35.542 --> 01:27:37.703
I'm working here.
This is my office.

01:27:38.044 --> 01:27:40.501
Do I come to your office
and ask you for your autograph?

01:27:40.881 --> 01:27:43.247
I don't think so. Jesus.

01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:45.006
What an ugly dog.

01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:47.174
It's... it's... it's okay, Joe.

01:27:47.554 --> 01:27:49.154
- It's okay.
- Oh. Come on.

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:01.731
Hey, Gary.

01:28:01.902 --> 01:28:02.732
Hey, nice playing.

01:28:02.903 --> 01:28:03.517
Hey, helluva round, Dave.

01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:05.335
- Oh, thanks a lot.
- Great start, simmsy.

01:28:05.489 --> 01:28:06.769
I got lucky out there.

01:28:09.743 --> 01:28:10.743
Hello, cup.

01:28:12.829 --> 01:28:15.821
I heard that you put
a monster number up there.

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:18.077
Yeah, well, it could
have been worse.

01:28:19.419 --> 01:28:20.909
You know, I played in the pro-am

01:28:21.087 --> 01:28:23.453
with some asshole
movie star here once.

01:28:25.008 --> 01:28:26.088
Shot an 82.

01:28:27.427 --> 01:28:29.042
Now, how in the world...

01:28:29.638 --> 01:28:31.924
Did a great ball striker
like yourself...

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:33.808
A legend...

01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:37.676
Manage to put up an 837

01:28:38.605 --> 01:28:41.312
well, I missed
a 4-foot putt on 18

01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:43.106
for an 82.

01:28:43.693 --> 01:28:44.693
That's how.

01:28:45.695 --> 01:28:48.732
Ain't like playing some muni track
in brownsville, is it, bucko?

01:28:50.492 --> 01:28:53.199
Does, uh, integrity,
tradition, and honor

01:28:53.537 --> 01:28:55.493
include kicking a man
when he's down?

01:28:59.209 --> 01:29:01.370
Come on, Molly.
This is just guy stuff.

01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:03.331
- Oh.
- It's just bar talk.

01:29:03.588 --> 01:29:04.748
No offense. Right, cup?

01:29:04.923 --> 01:29:07.643
You know, this man still has a lot of
great golf shots in his system.

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:09.199
Molly, it's okay. Just go away.

01:29:09.261 --> 01:29:12.003
Just... I don't need
any attention right now.

01:29:12.222 --> 01:29:14.713
I'll bet you $100
right now that Roy here

01:29:15.058 --> 01:29:16.173
can hit a ball

01:29:16.434 --> 01:29:18.846
through that door,
over the patio, and into the river.

01:29:19.312 --> 01:29:21.394
And, Harold,
give me a vodka tonic with a twist.

01:29:21.982 --> 01:29:23.643
Molly, honey...

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:25.140
Really, this isn't dignified.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.021
Oh.

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:28.776
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:29:29.406 --> 01:29:30.406
Roy.

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:32.025
I just wanna go back to Texas.

01:29:33.159 --> 01:29:34.159
What about the river?

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.576
The piranha, the immortality?

01:29:36.955 --> 01:29:38.161
All that bullshit?

01:29:38.957 --> 01:29:41.243
You gonna drag
your ass home with an 83?

01:29:44.754 --> 01:29:46.415
You know, $200.

01:29:46.715 --> 01:29:48.125
For $200...

01:29:48.675 --> 01:29:51.212
I say that Roy can hit the ball
through the damn bar,

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:53.342
out the patio, into the river,

01:29:53.513 --> 01:29:55.879
and make that pelican
right there fly off its post.

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:57.057
No way.

01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:58.427
From right here.

01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:03.262
God almighty.

01:30:03.773 --> 01:30:05.058
This is ridiculous.

01:30:06.026 --> 01:30:07.026
Hey.

01:30:08.111 --> 01:30:09.111
Hey.

01:30:09.487 --> 01:30:10.977
Hey, you got this shot, pods.

01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:13.863
You can do...
It's a hooded 4-iron, man.

01:30:14.034 --> 01:30:15.399
You just... you just turn it over,

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:17.943
and you start it off low...
You can do it.

01:30:18.121 --> 01:30:19.599
He can do this shot.
He can do this shot.

01:30:19.623 --> 01:30:20.703
He can do it, and anyway...

01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:22.059
I'm not leaving
till one of you men

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:23.823
start acting in a manly fashion.

01:30:24.002 --> 01:30:25.583
Should we just
get this over with?

01:30:33.762 --> 01:30:36.094
One ball, one swing.

01:30:38.558 --> 01:30:41.300
One... pelican.

01:30:41.978 --> 01:30:42.978
From right there.

01:30:44.481 --> 01:30:45.596
You can do it, Roy.

01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:47.605
Come on, you're the man.
Shut this guy up.

01:30:58.328 --> 01:30:59.328
One swing?

01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:00.530
One swing.

01:31:00.705 --> 01:31:02.070
I'll give you four-to-one odds.

01:31:02.248 --> 01:31:03.738
Shit, give him 10-to-1.

01:31:06.670 --> 01:31:08.080
Romeo, I'll need a fairway.

01:31:08.421 --> 01:31:09.035
Ladies and gentlemen, - yes.

01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:09.828
Here's what he's got:

01:31:10.006 --> 01:31:11.837
He's got 30 yards
of bar and grill.

01:31:12.008 --> 01:31:13.653
Then he's got to go
through the French doors,

01:31:13.677 --> 01:31:16.635
over the umbrellas,
and then carry 30 yards of river.

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:19.091
He's got to try to pop
that pelican right off its perch.

01:31:19.265 --> 01:31:20.926
Kind of a thin lie,
wouldn't you say?

01:31:21.101 --> 01:31:23.467
Beats all that deep-shit
rough you were in all day.

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:25.748
Fore! Fore in the bar!
Come on, clear it away!

01:31:25.772 --> 01:31:27.412
Pelican's on the other side.

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.021
Man, what a tough shot.

01:31:29.359 --> 01:31:30.599
I betcha he's gotta be thinking

01:31:30.735 --> 01:31:32.566
about that brutal, ego-sapping,

01:31:32.737 --> 01:31:33.817
manhood-robbing...

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:36.404
83 he buried himself
underneath today.

01:31:36.574 --> 01:31:39.407
That's an avalanche
of strokes, a mudslide.

01:31:39.577 --> 01:31:41.097
Romeo, you wanna get
control of that guy?

01:31:41.121 --> 01:31:42.952
Will you shut up? Get down.

01:31:54.634 --> 01:31:56.670
Yes! Yes!

01:31:56.845 --> 01:31:58.335
Did you see that shot?!

01:31:58.513 --> 01:32:00.219
Oh, my god!

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:06.767
That ought to cover it.

01:32:07.272 --> 01:32:08.272
Yeah.

01:32:08.982 --> 01:32:09.982
You know...

01:32:11.234 --> 01:32:12.565
You're all fucking nuts.

01:32:13.695 --> 01:32:14.695
Yeah.

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:16.363
Yeah.

01:32:23.079 --> 01:32:25.070
You really... look good.

01:32:28.001 --> 01:32:29.001
Oh.

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:32.209
J put your coffees down j

01:32:32.922 --> 01:32:34.708

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:38.337
j you're the only one
to get this done j

01:32:40.346 --> 01:32:42.211
j close and lock the door j

01:32:42.766 --> 01:32:44.722
j duck down to the floor j;

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:47.642

j 'cause this could take
all night >

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:03.241
I kind of shanked that, huh?

01:33:03.745 --> 01:33:05.076
No, no.

01:33:05.955 --> 01:33:07.715
- Hey, come on, you guys.
- =

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:08.872
Romeo!

01:33:08.917 --> 01:33:10.157
This is no time for a marathon!

01:33:11.336 --> 01:33:13.247
It's wet out here. Damn.

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:14.460
Tempo is everything.

01:33:14.631 --> 01:33:15.631
Mmm.

01:33:18.343 --> 01:33:19.583
Perfection is...

01:33:19.803 --> 01:33:21.509
Unattainable. = unattainable.

01:33:23.515 --> 01:33:24.675
You know, somebody said...

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.181
Golf and sex are
the only two things

01:33:27.352 --> 01:33:29.263
you don't have to be
good at to enjoy.

01:33:30.522 --> 01:33:31.522
Really?

01:33:33.233 --> 01:33:34.348
Can I have a mulligan?

01:33:34.526 --> 01:33:35.311
A what?

01:33:35.485 --> 01:33:36.485
A mulligan.

01:33:36.611 --> 01:33:37.896
What's a mulligan?

01:33:39.239 --> 01:33:39.773
Oh.

01:33:39.948 --> 01:33:42.280
Just hold still. Don't move.

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:42.984
Oh.

01:33:43.159 --> 01:33:45.115
And I'll show you. =- mmm.

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:46.947
In fact,
why don't you get on top,

01:33:47.122 --> 01:33:48.122
and I'll show you?

01:33:48.164 --> 01:33:49.404
Mmm. Tee it up.

01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:51.956
Come on, Roy!

01:33:53.128 --> 01:33:54.128
Damn!

01:33:55.213 --> 01:33:59.047
J baby, this could take
all night >

01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:01.625
j; Yeah j

01:34:02.679 --> 01:34:06.467
jj

01:34:13.398 --> 01:34:14.500
Welcome, everyone.

01:34:14.524 --> 01:34:16.043
Jim nantz with Ken venturi.

01:34:16.067 --> 01:34:17.773
The sun is struggling
to come out,

01:34:17.944 --> 01:34:19.104
the course is drying up,

01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:20.631
and in case you're
just joining us,

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:23.021
David Simms is tied for the lead
in the clubhouse

01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:25.190
at five under par
with Peter jacobsen.

01:34:25.368 --> 01:34:27.074
But the real story today, Kenny,

01:34:27.245 --> 01:34:29.736
involves a driving-range pro
from Texas

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:32.910
who shot
an opening-round 83 yesterday,

01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:35.871
but now is making a run
at us open history.

01:34:36.045 --> 01:34:38.787
The single-round record
in open history is in jeopardy

01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:40.250
because of Roy "tin cup"...

01:34:40.425 --> 01:34:42.305
Another driving-range pro,
that's all we needed.

01:34:42.468 --> 01:34:43.988
- More obscure guys.
- Unbelievable story.

01:34:44.012 --> 01:34:45.673
Yes, heroes is what I need.

01:34:46.055 --> 01:34:47.670
Not obscure driving-range pros.

01:34:48.308 --> 01:34:49.923
Okay, Ben, we're back at 16.

01:34:50.393 --> 01:34:51.098
Quickly.

01:34:51.269 --> 01:34:52.371
Now, this putt, uh,

01:34:52.395 --> 01:34:53.851
he's studied it
from every angle,

01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:55.307
and I'm sure he knows it's...

01:34:55.481 --> 01:34:59.099
It... he's just got to be firm
on the left-hand edge with this putt.

01:34:59.277 --> 01:35:00.642
Thumbnails on these clowns.

01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:02.481
I have no idea
where he came from,

01:35:03.114 --> 01:35:05.605
but here he is
going 10 under if he makes it.

01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:06.863
He's getting ready to putt.

01:35:09.579 --> 01:35:10.159
Look at that.

01:35:10.330 --> 01:35:11.740
Smooth as silk.

01:35:11.915 --> 01:35:13.576
Made it!

01:35:13.917 --> 01:35:16.579
10 under par for mcavoy.

01:35:17.086 --> 01:35:18.496
Man alive!

01:35:18.755 --> 01:35:22.168
This is, uh...
The stuff of, uh, legend, I would say.

01:35:25.428 --> 01:35:27.760
- Who's mcavoy?
- Mcavoy?

01:35:27.931 --> 01:35:29.796
John, you ever heard
of this mcavoy guy?

01:35:30.308 --> 01:35:33.141
Roy mcavoy after a par at 17,

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:35.134
an eagle to shoot 60,

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:37.118
although no one
has knocked it on the green

01:35:37.232 --> 01:35:38.597
in 2 here today.

01:35:38.775 --> 01:35:41.086
This is not a shot
you really wanna get aggressive with.

01:35:41.110 --> 01:35:41.849
You gotta be conservative.

01:35:42.028 --> 01:35:43.228
You gotta think this shot out.

01:35:43.363 --> 01:35:44.478
He's in great position.

01:35:44.656 --> 01:35:46.271
Well, it's a 3-shot par 5.

01:35:46.449 --> 01:35:48.440
Especially today,
a little wind in the face.

01:35:48.826 --> 01:35:50.942
John daly, in fact,
ended up in the water

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:52.735
trying to go
for this green in 2.

01:35:53.289 --> 01:35:55.154
237, man, to carry that water.

01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:58.916
Jj

01:36:00.338 --> 01:36:01.338
237, man.

01:36:09.639 --> 01:36:10.639
3-wood.

01:36:18.773 --> 01:36:19.432
Hit the hell out of it.

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:20.793
You know, Jimmy,
his adrenaline may have

01:36:20.817 --> 01:36:21.602
gotten the better of him.

01:36:21.776 --> 01:36:23.516
If he lays up,
he takes bogey out of play.

01:36:23.778 --> 01:36:26.861
He goes for the green,
he brings six in, he brings seven in.

01:36:27.198 --> 01:36:29.109
But he's gotta remember,
he's in contention.

01:36:29.284 --> 01:36:32.071
He has a chance to win the us open.
He's gotta play smart.

01:36:32.996 --> 01:36:33.996
Wow.

01:36:35.373 --> 01:36:36.373
Nope.

01:36:41.462 --> 01:36:42.952
Ohh!

01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:46.151
Jimmy,
he just didn't have enough club.

01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:48.260
Well, what the hell.

01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:50.551
You ride her
till she bucks you...

01:36:51.389 --> 01:36:52.674
Or you don't ride at all.

01:36:52.974 --> 01:36:55.841
If he can still
knock a wedge close and make par,

01:36:56.227 --> 01:36:59.060
it would conclude one of the most
remarkable turnarounds

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:00.390
in tournament history.

01:37:00.690 --> 01:37:02.543
He's got
about 85 yards from here, Jim,

01:37:02.567 --> 01:37:04.558
and the drop zone
is short of the water.

01:37:04.902 --> 01:37:06.733
And he'll need to get this
on the upper level

01:37:06.904 --> 01:37:08.394
of this multi-terraced green.

01:37:13.578 --> 01:37:15.409
Now, that's a good solid shot

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:18.492
leaving him about
12 feet away for par,

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:23.285
a par and 62, the all-time
open round record.

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:36.556
Good stroke.

01:37:36.851 --> 01:37:37.851
He's got it.

01:37:38.353 --> 01:37:40.765
Unbelievable!
Roy mcavoy has done it!

01:37:40.938 --> 01:37:43.020
You have just seen
the greatest round

01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:45.227
in United States open history.

01:37:45.651 --> 01:37:46.811
62.

01:37:48.112 --> 01:37:50.524
The all-time lowest round
in the majors

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:52.814
doesn't belong
to a Jack nicklaus

01:37:52.992 --> 01:37:55.904
or an Arnold Palmer,
Nelson, hogan, or snead.

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.237
It has been shot by
the most improbable artist of all.

01:37:59.582 --> 01:38:01.698
Roy mcavoy has his signature

01:38:01.876 --> 01:38:04.367
on golf's all-time
masterpiece round.

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:13.364
You know, I got some money
from the pelican bet.

01:38:13.388 --> 01:38:15.188
Why don't we go
somewhere fancy and celebrate,

01:38:15.348 --> 01:38:16.450
get ready for the final round?

01:38:16.474 --> 01:38:18.385
There's nothing to celebrate.

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:20.390
Besides, these are
my people, right?

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:21.561
That's right.

01:38:22.021 --> 01:38:23.306
I'm a waffle house guy.

01:38:23.481 --> 01:38:24.812
Gotta stay in touch with that.

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:27.013
Plus, he needs
his carbohydrates.

01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:27.685
Yeah.

01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:29.460
Plus, if the boys
in salome were in town,

01:38:29.529 --> 01:38:30.939
this is where they'd be.

01:38:31.114 --> 01:38:32.274
Okay. All right.

01:38:32.448 --> 01:38:34.279
Yay! The legend.

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:36.949
Goddamn, we've been
on a bus for 2 days,

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:38.405
riding around, riding around.

01:38:38.704 --> 01:38:40.365
Oh, god, it's so good
to see you.

01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:41.683
It's so good to see you.

01:38:41.707 --> 01:38:43.018
I didn't know you
were gonna come.

01:38:43.042 --> 01:38:44.077
Sweet 62!

01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:46.325
- Hey, hey.
- Put the tables together.

01:38:46.504 --> 01:38:47.619
Put 'em together.

01:38:47.922 --> 01:38:49.442
Put this up and rest your rump.

01:38:49.674 --> 01:38:51.460
- Does this feel like home?
- Yeah.

01:38:51.634 --> 01:38:54.546
We just want you to know
that we are with you all the way.

01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:57.215
Doreen, uh, meet Dr. griswold.

01:38:57.432 --> 01:38:59.093
- Uh, this is Molly.
- Hi.

01:38:59.892 --> 01:39:01.007
She's, uh, my shrink.

01:39:01.185 --> 01:39:03.301
- Hi.
- Well, ex-shrink, um...

01:39:03.479 --> 01:39:05.970
We're sleeping together now,
so I can't be his therapist.

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:07.774
Knew it. Thanks.

01:39:08.192 --> 01:39:09.192
Knew what?

01:39:09.444 --> 01:39:10.524
Oh, nothing.

01:39:10.695 --> 01:39:11.695
Good luck.

01:39:12.572 --> 01:39:13.732
You know what, guys?

01:39:13.823 --> 01:39:15.688
I have got a little extra cash.

01:39:15.867 --> 01:39:19.405
Why don't we all just go somewhere
a little fancy and celebrate?

01:39:19.579 --> 01:39:20.579
- Exactly.
- Why?

01:39:21.038 --> 01:39:22.238
Well, in honor of, you know...

01:39:22.331 --> 01:39:23.161
This is the waffle house,
Doreen.

01:39:23.332 --> 01:39:24.822
Well, I know,
and I love the waffle...

01:39:25.001 --> 01:39:28.243
I've been dreaming about waffles
for... 1,800 miles.

01:39:28.421 --> 01:39:29.421
Yeah, me, too.

01:39:29.464 --> 01:39:31.384
You know, here's a waffle house
exactly like this

01:39:31.466 --> 01:39:32.581
in Odessa, Texas. = yeah.

01:39:32.758 --> 01:39:34.464
Odessa?
It's in midland, ain't it?

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:35.841
No, it's in Odessa.

01:39:36.053 --> 01:39:38.920
Honey, it's in Odessa.
I'm from Odessa, and it's in Odessa.

01:39:39.098 --> 01:39:41.259
I was born there, honey,
and that's where it is.

01:39:41.434 --> 01:39:42.434
To the man.

01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:43.382
To the cup!

01:39:43.561 --> 01:39:45.097
- To the cup!
- To the cup!

01:39:45.271 --> 01:39:46.351
You didn't have to do that.

01:39:47.773 --> 01:39:49.684
You look particularly
lovely tonight, Doreen.

01:39:50.026 --> 01:39:51.562
Oh, well, thank you.

01:39:53.154 --> 01:39:54.381
I don't know if anybody
ever told you,

01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:55.895
but you're really
a helluva dancer.

01:39:57.325 --> 01:39:58.690
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:39:59.035 --> 01:40:00.195
Yeah, but they had one there.

01:40:00.369 --> 01:40:02.030
That's all I'm saying.
They had one there.

01:40:02.205 --> 01:40:04.161
Wait, wait. = it was... Odessa.

01:40:04.332 --> 01:40:05.684
That's not what I
was talking about,

01:40:05.708 --> 01:40:07.144
and you know the place
that we stopped?

01:40:07.168 --> 01:40:09.329
Listen, there is one easy way
to figure this out.

01:40:09.921 --> 01:40:10.921
You ever tango?

01:40:11.506 --> 01:40:12.506
- Tango?
- Mm-hmm.

01:40:12.882 --> 01:40:13.882
Uh, no.

01:40:15.259 --> 01:40:16.259
Do you?

01:40:16.802 --> 01:40:17.962
Well, you know...

01:40:19.639 --> 01:40:21.504
Romeo, you dance?

01:40:22.767 --> 01:40:23.767
It doesn't matter!

01:40:25.394 --> 01:40:26.884
It doesn't get
much better than this.

01:40:32.109 --> 01:40:34.395
Well,
this extraordinary Roy mcavoy,

01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:35.855
he just won't go away,

01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:38.692
this, uh, humble
driving-range pro

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:41.323
from... salome,
wherever that is.

01:40:41.494 --> 01:40:42.494
Little town, west Texas.

01:40:42.787 --> 01:40:43.993
It hasn't been discovered yet.

01:40:44.163 --> 01:40:45.494
Over to 18, guys, quickly.

01:40:45.665 --> 01:40:48.202
Kenny, this is John cook
at the par 518th,

01:40:48.376 --> 01:40:50.207
no stranger
to championship play.

01:40:50.378 --> 01:40:52.084
He's going to lay up
with a 7-iron.

01:40:53.965 --> 01:40:56.047
Meanwhile, here's Roy mcavoy.

01:40:56.509 --> 01:40:57.694
He has the same shot

01:40:57.718 --> 01:40:59.379
he knocked in the water
yesterday, Jimmy.

01:40:59.554 --> 01:41:02.387
The thing to do right now is tune out
the gallery saying, "go for it."

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.096
He's now back in contention,

01:41:04.350 --> 01:41:06.181
but he must continue
to play smart.

01:41:06.352 --> 01:41:07.352
Gimme a 3-wood.

01:41:12.191 --> 01:41:13.961
Well, he's...
He's pulled the 3-wood,

01:41:13.985 --> 01:41:15.646
and he continues
to play this tournament

01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:16.820
without an ounce of fear.

01:41:16.988 --> 01:41:19.400
That is just inexperience,
just pure and simple.

01:41:19.574 --> 01:41:21.189
This is for venturi
up there in the booth

01:41:21.367 --> 01:41:22.447
thinking I should lay up.

01:41:23.286 --> 01:41:24.696
Yeah, what does he know?

01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:26.790
He only won this tournament
before you were born.

01:41:33.296 --> 01:41:34.035
Caught it a little bit high,

01:41:34.213 --> 01:41:34.998
a little breeze in his face.

01:41:35.172 --> 01:41:37.379
That's... that's gotta go,
gotta go.

01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:39.945
He's done it again.

01:41:39.969 --> 01:41:40.583
No, not again.

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:42.342
He has found the water

01:41:42.513 --> 01:41:44.845
for the third straight day.

01:41:45.016 --> 01:41:46.506
What was he thinking about?

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:47.934
Gimme another ball.

01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:50.020
Roy.

01:41:50.646 --> 01:41:51.305
What?

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:52.640
It's a water hazard.

01:41:53.357 --> 01:41:54.637
You go up there and take a drop,

01:41:54.817 --> 01:41:56.728
try to save par,
just like you did yesterday.

01:41:58.029 --> 01:41:59.029
You're right.

01:42:00.156 --> 01:42:01.396
The hell was I thinking?

01:42:02.533 --> 01:42:04.865
He's tied for the lead,
this Roy mcavoy,

01:42:05.036 --> 01:42:06.947
this tin cup, this empty cup,

01:42:07.121 --> 01:42:08.827
this airbrain out of nowhere.

01:42:09.081 --> 01:42:09.615
West Texas.

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:12.577
And, uh, I... yeah, west...
Thank... thank you for west Texas.

01:42:12.752 --> 01:42:15.414
You, uh, went for
the green on 18 today.

01:42:15.588 --> 01:42:17.388
I'm just wondering
if you think that cost you.

01:42:17.465 --> 01:42:18.830
I saved par, didn't 1?

01:42:19.675 --> 01:42:20.755
- Well...
- Didn't I?

01:42:20.926 --> 01:42:22.821
I'm just trying to understand
what you're thinking.

01:42:22.845 --> 01:42:25.552
You had the same shot yesterday on 18
without a headwind...

01:42:25.723 --> 01:42:27.483
You don't think
I can knock it on from there?

01:42:27.642 --> 01:42:29.282
Let's just say it's
a low-percentage shot.

01:42:29.352 --> 01:42:32.014
Well, so am I.
I mean, look at me, all right?

01:42:32.188 --> 01:42:32.722
Look what I'm wearing.

01:42:32.897 --> 01:42:35.855
I mean, I'm playing for rio grande
short-haul trucking,

01:42:36.025 --> 01:42:38.516
brink's and brown's
sanitation, uh...

01:42:39.654 --> 01:42:41.269
First state bank of salome,

01:42:41.739 --> 01:42:43.195
Woody's smokehouse.
You think a...

01:42:44.659 --> 01:42:47.776
You think a guy like me bothers
to worry about the percentages?

01:43:10.226 --> 01:43:12.262
Are you nervous
about tomorrow, Roy?

01:43:20.194 --> 01:43:21.980
It won't always
be like this, you know.

01:43:22.738 --> 01:43:23.738
What?

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:27.523
With me, surrounded by
all these guys snorin',

01:43:27.952 --> 01:43:30.238
stripper ex-girlfriend
layin' across from us.

01:43:33.249 --> 01:43:35.240
My caddy sleepin' next to her.

01:43:37.253 --> 01:43:38.914
It won't always be like this.

01:43:40.172 --> 01:43:41.662
Yes, it will, Roy.

01:43:42.591 --> 01:43:43.591
It will.

01:44:09.243 --> 01:44:10.653
Dollar bills.

01:44:14.290 --> 01:44:18.408
Jj

01:44:18.586 --> 01:44:19.951
Dollar bills.

01:44:27.636 --> 01:44:28.751
Dollar bills.

01:44:32.016 --> 01:44:38.728
Jj

01:44:41.942 --> 01:44:44.103
First up, in the final pairing,

01:44:44.278 --> 01:44:47.862
from salome, Texas, Roy mcavoy.

01:44:48.741 --> 01:44:49.781
Fairways and Greens, Dave,

01:44:49.909 --> 01:44:52.616
and don't forget to wave
as I blow by.

01:44:53.037 --> 01:44:54.743
You mean blow up,
don't ya, sport?

01:44:55.206 --> 01:44:56.206
You always do.

01:44:57.124 --> 01:45:00.287
Jj

01:45:09.804 --> 01:45:14.514
Jj

01:45:20.856 --> 01:45:22.642
Awww...

01:45:27.071 --> 01:45:27.730
Son of a...

01:45:27.905 --> 01:45:30.021
Playing out of Houston, Texas,

01:45:30.491 --> 01:45:32.231
David Simms.

01:45:37.039 --> 01:45:38.599
It's okay. I know exactly
where you are.

01:45:38.999 --> 01:45:40.359
Don't worry.
You're in great shape.

01:45:41.836 --> 01:45:46.045
Jj

01:45:58.602 --> 01:45:59.704
What kind of lie we got, boss?

01:45:59.728 --> 01:46:01.093
Oh, shit. It's buried.

01:46:01.272 --> 01:46:02.272
Uh-oh.

01:46:03.941 --> 01:46:05.752
All right. Be careful.
Don't... don't touch it.

01:46:05.776 --> 01:46:07.357
I know the rules, Romeo.

01:46:11.365 --> 01:46:12.365
Which way ya gonna go?

01:46:12.992 --> 01:46:14.198
Go right through there.

01:46:14.535 --> 01:46:15.535
Go for it.

01:46:19.874 --> 01:46:21.080
No! God!

01:46:21.333 --> 01:46:22.519
Don't worry about it.
It was my fault.

01:46:22.543 --> 01:46:23.979
I gave you the wrong club.
Okay? You'll be fine.

01:46:24.003 --> 01:46:24.662
You put a good move on the ball.

01:46:24.837 --> 01:46:26.231
- Shut up.
- Really, now, don't worry about it.

01:46:26.255 --> 01:46:27.649
Here... you did fine.
Give me the club.

01:46:27.673 --> 01:46:28.733
Thank you very much, Jim.

01:46:28.757 --> 01:46:30.418
We've just heard that Roy mcavoy

01:46:30.593 --> 01:46:34.677
has taken a disastrous double bogey
to open his final round here.

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:37.512
Ah, double back there, Roy.

01:46:37.892 --> 01:46:39.382
Just keep makin' pars, asshole.

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:42.051
I'll take 18 of 'em,
all day long.

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:43.810
Do it, and I'll own ya.

01:46:43.981 --> 01:46:47.348
Jj

01:46:56.619 --> 01:46:58.575
Jj

01:47:09.882 --> 01:47:12.089
Jj

01:47:12.259 --> 01:47:13.259
Fore!

01:47:18.599 --> 01:47:21.932
Roy mcavoy's 2nd shot
at the 2nd hole

01:47:22.186 --> 01:47:23.926
has gone deep into the woods.

01:47:24.605 --> 01:47:26.311
For a report on his plight,

01:47:26.482 --> 01:47:27.972
let's go down to Gary mccord,

01:47:28.150 --> 01:47:31.984
who has spent most of his life in
the woods and in darkness. Gary?

01:47:32.446 --> 01:47:33.982
Ben, he's in jail here.

01:47:34.198 --> 01:47:35.529
No chance for parole.

01:47:35.699 --> 01:47:37.189
In fact,
the only thing he's got...

01:47:37.701 --> 01:47:39.461
He's got to hit the ball
back in the fairway,

01:47:39.662 --> 01:47:40.847
try to pitch ball on the green,

01:47:40.871 --> 01:47:42.098
and get up and down for his par.

01:47:42.122 --> 01:47:43.762
He's got no chance
to hit it on the green.

01:47:45.417 --> 01:47:47.658
50 bucks says
I knock it on from here with a 7-iron.

01:47:47.878 --> 01:47:48.708
On the green?

01:47:48.879 --> 01:47:49.879
Right on the green.

01:47:50.297 --> 01:47:51.297
You got it.

01:47:51.465 --> 01:47:53.443
Marsha, you want to move
these people back right here?

01:47:53.467 --> 01:47:54.467
I'm goin' right there.

01:47:58.472 --> 01:47:59.752
Mccord, what you got?

01:48:00.057 --> 01:48:01.217
What's he... what's he doing?

01:48:02.643 --> 01:48:05.134
Ben, I think he's gonna
try the old ricochet off the port-a-let

01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:06.392
with a hooded 7-iron.

01:48:06.939 --> 01:48:08.583
He is! He's gonna hit it
right off the shitter!

01:48:08.607 --> 01:48:10.807
I cannot believe he's
about to hit this shot.

01:48:10.985 --> 01:48:13.442
Dave, vt 1, record, record.
Record this shot.

01:48:13.904 --> 01:48:14.939
Hey!

01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:28.825
Roy mcavoy
has banked his 3rd shot at the 2nd hole

01:48:29.003 --> 01:48:31.665
between the trees,
off a water closet...

01:48:31.922 --> 01:48:33.878
Toilet or loo,
as you might call it...

01:48:34.049 --> 01:48:36.882
And got it on the green,
somehow, in three.

01:48:37.052 --> 01:48:37.837
May be the shot, though,

01:48:38.012 --> 01:48:40.549
that does get him right
back on track here in this final round.

01:48:40.723 --> 01:48:42.304
It could erase
that double bogey at one.

01:48:42.474 --> 01:48:44.474
It may be the best thing
that ever happened to him.

01:49:14.715 --> 01:49:16.626
Oh, that was great.

01:49:17.009 --> 01:49:19.250
I didn't know there was
a little mirror thing in here.

01:49:19.428 --> 01:49:20.428
Isn't this cute?

01:49:32.399 --> 01:49:34.185
Here. Let me just look at my...

01:49:36.111 --> 01:49:39.603
Jj

01:50:19.363 --> 01:50:22.363
Looks pretty level. Just roll it
in like you know what you're doin'.

01:50:25.327 --> 01:50:26.362
Hit it close, sport.

01:50:27.204 --> 01:50:30.446
Jj

01:50:49.017 --> 01:50:50.803
Yes! Yes! Yaah!

01:51:03.157 --> 01:51:05.318
Doreen, how did he
get the name "tin cup"?

01:51:05.993 --> 01:51:08.575
Oh, he was the catcher
on the high school baseball team.

01:51:09.204 --> 01:51:11.035
The star pitcher had
a big league curve.

01:51:11.248 --> 01:51:13.739
Not all his pitches
hit Roy in the mitt. Ouch.

01:51:14.710 --> 01:51:17.998
Team thought "tin cup”
was a whole lot better than "clank."

01:51:19.756 --> 01:51:20.756
Clank...

01:51:25.721 --> 01:51:27.461
= fuck.

01:51:34.646 --> 01:51:37.183
Jj

01:51:48.118 --> 01:51:49.858
Molly, can I ask you a question?

01:51:50.204 --> 01:51:51.204
Sure.

01:51:51.538 --> 01:51:53.403
Have you ever had a Latin lover?

01:51:54.124 --> 01:51:55.910
Where does he get his name from

01:51:56.084 --> 01:51:57.665
is what I wanna know.

01:52:00.088 --> 01:52:03.956
Why did you wait
so long to leave that Simms character?

01:52:04.384 --> 01:52:06.591
Well, it takes
a little while to realize

01:52:06.762 --> 01:52:08.156
that prince charming
might be wearing

01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:09.295
a beer-stained undershirt

01:52:09.473 --> 01:52:11.033
with a sausage hangin'
out of his mouth,

01:52:11.141 --> 01:52:14.975
makin' $7.00 an hour in
some armadillo-infested driving range.

01:52:15.145 --> 01:52:17.332
You're not one of these women
who tries to fix men, I hope.

01:52:17.356 --> 01:52:19.563
I mean, men cannot be fixed
and especially him.

01:52:19.733 --> 01:52:21.794
Yeah. Well, I've been
pathetically slow learning that lesson.

01:52:21.818 --> 01:52:23.604
Molly. Hey.

01:52:23.946 --> 01:52:25.506
- Hi. How are ya?
- How are you?

01:52:25.530 --> 01:52:27.771
Good. Hey, I could
use a little help, I think.

01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:29.385
You know, I've seen what
you've done with mcavoy

01:52:29.409 --> 01:52:30.694
and all
that psychological stuff.

01:52:30.869 --> 01:52:32.096
I think it could
come in pretty handy.

01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:33.656
Well, hey! Let me
give you my card.

01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:35.240
- Sure.
- Yeah, that'd be great.

01:52:35.707 --> 01:52:37.852
Super. If, uh, actually, if you
got a few more of these,

01:52:37.876 --> 01:52:40.104
there's a bunch of guys in the locker room
could use your help as well, I'm sure.

01:52:40.128 --> 01:52:41.189
You know what? Take 'em all.

01:52:41.213 --> 01:52:42.373
Thanks. This is Doreen.

01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:43.328
- Hi. I'm Doreen.
- Hi, Doreen. How are you?

01:52:43.507 --> 01:52:45.907
And, you know, my number's right there.
Just call me anytime.

01:52:46.009 --> 01:52:46.794
I do counsel couples,

01:52:46.969 --> 01:52:48.947
so if you want to bring your caddy,
that'd be just fine.

01:52:48.971 --> 01:52:50.573
Yeah, I'll think about it,
and I'll give you a call.

01:52:50.597 --> 01:52:51.597
- Okay.
- Great, thanks.

01:52:51.723 --> 01:52:53.054
- Bye. Nice meetin' you.
- See ya.

01:52:54.017 --> 01:52:55.017
Cheers.

01:52:55.102 --> 01:52:56.102
Oh. Cheers.

01:53:17.165 --> 01:53:18.405
Yes! Ho!

01:53:18.583 --> 01:53:20.414
Boom.

01:53:21.336 --> 01:53:24.078
That puts jacobsen
into a tie at seven, guys,

01:53:24.256 --> 01:53:26.622
and that, uh, tin cup guy
is 1 shot back.

01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:28.040
Let's keep abreast of that.

01:53:28.969 --> 01:53:32.177
That birdie by Peter jacobsen
forged a tie now for the lead

01:53:32.347 --> 01:53:34.053
at seven under with David Simms.

01:53:34.349 --> 01:53:36.556
And Roy mcavoy
just won't go away.

01:53:36.727 --> 01:53:39.560
He's only one shot back
at six under par.

01:53:56.663 --> 01:53:58.278
Man, he's throwin'
darts back there.

01:53:58.665 --> 01:54:00.745
If we don't make some birdies,
we're playin' for 2nd.

01:54:01.168 --> 01:54:03.159
Mcavoy? You believe
he's still hangin' around?

01:54:03.378 --> 01:54:04.981
It's hard to believe
that a guy named tin cup

01:54:05.005 --> 01:54:06.733
might have his name
beneath mine on the trophy.

01:54:06.757 --> 01:54:10.045
So it's come down to the 72nd
hole of this great championship,

01:54:10.218 --> 01:54:14.427
and three men, all battling
to be crowned the next open champion.

01:54:14.598 --> 01:54:17.886
Peter jacobsen is in the fairway
at 18 at eight under par,

01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:21.473
tied for the lead with Roy mcavoy,
who's on the 18th tee.

01:54:21.646 --> 01:54:24.103
And David Simms is
back there trailing by one.

01:54:41.583 --> 01:54:42.663
Jacobsen"s layin' up.

01:54:42.834 --> 01:54:43.949
Yeah, he took out an iron.

01:54:44.127 --> 01:54:45.355
Jacobsen's gonna lay up, Jim,

01:54:45.379 --> 01:54:46.960
and I think that's
a very smart move.

01:54:47.130 --> 01:54:49.872
He's tied for the lead,
virtually assures himself of a par.

01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:52.541
And with his short game,
he could make birdie.

01:54:54.179 --> 01:54:55.760
You ain't gonna have
that luxury, Dave.

01:54:58.392 --> 01:54:59.427
Not if you play to win.

01:55:26.503 --> 01:55:28.463
Well, we've
seen this position before.

01:55:28.630 --> 01:55:31.622
Mcavoy with another
perfect drive at the 18th.

01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:33.415
The last thing he needs
right now, Jim,

01:55:33.593 --> 01:55:35.879
is an excuse to go
for the green again.

01:55:36.304 --> 01:55:37.544
I didn't catch it all.

01:55:37.889 --> 01:55:40.221
That's okay. You have
to lay up, then.

01:56:06.209 --> 01:56:08.370
Jj

01:56:16.303 --> 01:56:17.634
This is for par.

01:56:21.183 --> 01:56:22.183
So birdie wins it.

01:56:22.309 --> 01:56:23.309
Birdie wins it.

01:56:23.643 --> 01:56:26.259
That's par. Lower 3rd.

01:56:26.438 --> 01:56:28.249
- He's in the lead now.
- Jacobsen"s in the lead.

01:56:28.273 --> 01:56:29.273
Eight under.

01:56:29.316 --> 01:56:30.956
And they all have to catch him.

01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:32.109
You or me, Dave?

01:56:42.287 --> 01:56:43.287
Wanna lay up?

01:56:44.956 --> 01:56:45.956
He's layin' up.

01:56:47.209 --> 01:56:48.289
He's layin' up.

01:56:49.211 --> 01:56:50.211
Yeah.

01:56:50.378 --> 01:56:52.164
Birdie to tie, eagle to win.

01:56:52.547 --> 01:56:54.412
Gutless wonder's layin' up.

01:56:55.091 --> 01:56:57.002
It's a birdie to win
and par to tie for you.

01:56:57.511 --> 01:56:58.591
You lay up, too, man.

01:57:00.055 --> 01:57:02.091
You can still
make a... birdie layin' up.

01:57:03.308 --> 01:57:04.468
You know somethin', romes?

01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:07.142
If I make a eagle,
that puts me 10 under.

01:57:07.646 --> 01:57:10.137
No one's ever finished
an open 10 under, not even nicklaus.

01:57:11.608 --> 01:57:13.439
You don't need
an eagle to win, Roy.

01:57:13.902 --> 01:57:15.858
Birdie wins! Par ties!

01:57:16.029 --> 01:57:17.029
Now lay it up.

01:57:20.116 --> 01:57:21.401
Birdie wins! Par ties!

01:57:21.576 --> 01:57:23.942
Look, you can hole out a wedge
for a goddamn eagle.

01:57:26.248 --> 01:57:27.408
This is everything, ain't it?

01:57:28.041 --> 01:57:29.702
This is the choice
it comes down to.

01:57:29.876 --> 01:57:31.537
This is our immortality.

01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:33.581
You don't need to be
thinkin' immortality.

01:57:34.005 --> 01:57:35.870
You need to be thinkin',
"hit the 7-iron"!

01:57:39.761 --> 01:57:41.342
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:57:41.596 --> 01:57:43.006
This is what always happens.

01:57:43.848 --> 01:57:44.848
He's goin' for it.

01:57:45.183 --> 01:57:46.183
Go for it!

01:57:49.688 --> 01:57:50.848
Molly, get a grip.

01:57:51.773 --> 01:57:53.980
He only needs par to tie.
Tell him to lay up.

01:57:54.150 --> 01:57:55.150
He'll listen to you.

01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:57.225
Go for it, Roy.
Just knock it on.

01:57:57.904 --> 01:58:00.520
Mol... you know,
this is why we broke up.

01:58:00.782 --> 01:58:02.113
He always went for it.

01:58:02.617 --> 01:58:03.636
You know what my problem is,

01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:06.197
is I've never
been with a man who went for it.

01:58:06.413 --> 01:58:08.779
Well, honey, he's your guy.

01:58:11.626 --> 01:58:12.741
One swing, Roy.

01:58:13.837 --> 01:58:15.327
One good swing.

01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:20.294
John daly couldn't
get there in 2.

01:58:20.468 --> 01:58:21.207
What the hell is he doing?

01:58:21.386 --> 01:58:23.593
Unbelievable that he's doing this.
Four days in a row...

01:58:23.763 --> 01:58:26.117
No. It's three days
he's put the ball in the water.

01:58:26.141 --> 01:58:28.257
It'll be four days
if he hits this 3-wood.

01:58:28.643 --> 01:58:29.643
Unbelievable.

01:58:31.354 --> 01:58:32.764
Come on, baby...

01:58:33.148 --> 01:58:33.978
- Please...
- We're home.

01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:35.685
Jj

01:58:35.859 --> 01:58:37.059
This has a chance.

01:58:37.652 --> 01:58:39.893
It's gotta go...
This has got a chance.

01:58:40.238 --> 01:58:41.238
I think he's done it.

01:58:41.364 --> 01:58:44.106
Jj

01:58:44.284 --> 01:58:45.364
A little gust there, romes.

01:58:52.250 --> 01:58:53.456
D

01:58:55.837 --> 01:58:57.117
Yes, he did... oh!

01:58:57.213 --> 01:58:57.793
- Hold up!
- Stay up!

01:58:57.964 --> 01:58:59.317
- Stay up!
- Hold up!

01:58:59.341 --> 01:59:00.046
No!

01:59:00.342 --> 01:59:01.444
- Stay up! Stay...
- Whoa!

01:59:05.597 --> 01:59:07.303
No! No! Go back! Back!

01:59:15.023 --> 01:59:16.138
Aw... shit!

01:59:16.441 --> 01:59:18.227
Jj

01:59:18.568 --> 01:59:20.399
You can still make par
from up there, Roy.

01:59:20.904 --> 01:59:21.944
She's right, pods.

01:59:22.113 --> 01:59:23.424
Take a drop and a stroke
up and down,

01:59:23.448 --> 01:59:24.488
we'll make par, we'll tie.

01:59:24.616 --> 01:59:25.616
I nutted that thing.

01:59:26.326 --> 01:59:27.326
I mean, I nutted it.

01:59:28.119 --> 01:59:28.858
I know you did, man.

01:59:29.037 --> 01:59:30.527
You put a helluva
move on that, man.

01:59:30.705 --> 01:59:32.741
Little gust
from the gods cost me.

01:59:33.375 --> 01:59:35.436
Okay, look, we'll go up there,
we'll take our drop, we'll tie,

01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:36.646
and we'll win it in the playoff.

01:59:36.670 --> 01:59:37.670
I can make that shot!

01:59:37.754 --> 01:59:39.665
I know you can, Roy,
but not now!

01:59:39.839 --> 01:59:40.839
Now!

01:59:41.299 --> 01:59:43.255
I'm playin' it
from right here, now!

01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:47.302
Take your drop
and make your par, Roy.

01:59:47.472 --> 01:59:48.472
Now.

01:59:48.682 --> 01:59:49.682
Take a drop, Roy.

01:59:50.517 --> 01:59:51.222
Gimme a ball.

01:59:51.393 --> 01:59:52.678
Unbelievable.

01:59:55.855 --> 01:59:57.061
I can't watch this.

02:00:03.988 --> 02:00:04.647
Fourth shot.

02:00:04.823 --> 02:00:05.983
- Aw, honey.
- Oh, my god.

02:00:06.157 --> 02:00:07.385
Jimmy, I don't believe this.

02:00:07.409 --> 02:00:10.572
He could go up,
use the drop zone, make par,

02:00:10.912 --> 02:00:12.493
force a playoff with jacobsen,

02:00:13.039 --> 02:00:14.039
and get outta here.

02:00:14.082 --> 02:00:16.164
Easy, guys.
Now, he could still make a five.

02:00:16.334 --> 02:00:17.561
- That's right.
- He can still make a five.

02:00:17.585 --> 02:00:18.785
We could still have a playoff.

02:00:18.878 --> 02:00:20.158
Stay with him, Paulie.

02:00:33.435 --> 02:00:34.720
Oh, no!

02:00:41.401 --> 02:00:42.481
Gimme another ball.

02:00:43.153 --> 02:00:44.153
Take a drop, Roy.

02:00:44.195 --> 02:00:44.934
Roy, just...

02:00:45.113 --> 02:00:46.148
Gimme another ball!

02:00:47.407 --> 02:00:48.738
Roy, just take your drop.

02:00:55.707 --> 02:00:57.868
Droppin' five. Hittin® six.

02:00:58.168 --> 02:00:59.437
What the hell is he gonna do?

02:00:59.461 --> 02:01:00.604
Why would he hit it from here?

02:01:00.628 --> 02:01:02.481
All he had to do
was walk up there, take a drop,

02:01:02.505 --> 02:01:03.961
and make a 5,
for cryin' out loud.

02:01:04.132 --> 02:01:05.132
That's insane.

02:01:05.633 --> 02:01:07.043
Somebody tackle him!

02:01:09.846 --> 02:01:10.846
Gimme another ball.

02:01:16.019 --> 02:01:17.179
Awww!

02:01:18.021 --> 02:01:19.021
Shit!

02:01:23.401 --> 02:01:25.892
Droppin' seven,
hittin' his eighth shot.

02:01:32.535 --> 02:01:34.776
I'll tell ya, it's a miracle
he lasted this long.

02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:39.163
Jj

02:01:43.046 --> 02:01:45.458
Look at Simms.
We ought to have a camera on Simms.

02:01:45.632 --> 02:01:46.632
He can't watch.

02:01:46.883 --> 02:01:49.625
Somebody tell this clown
he doesn't have to hit it from there.

02:01:51.721 --> 02:01:54.212
All right. Now he's droppin' nine.
He's hittin' ten.

02:01:55.809 --> 02:01:59.017
Jj

02:02:06.903 --> 02:02:08.894
Oh, god. I'm gonna faint.

02:02:11.282 --> 02:02:12.317
Oh, Jesus.

02:02:19.666 --> 02:02:21.466
This is the last ball
you got in the bag, Roy.

02:02:21.709 --> 02:02:23.495
You get this one wet,
we're disqualified.

02:02:24.087 --> 02:02:25.418
I can make it across.

02:02:25.797 --> 02:02:26.797
Well, then do it.

02:02:27.131 --> 02:02:28.337
Quit fuckin' around.

02:02:33.137 --> 02:02:34.252
Oh...

02:02:38.059 --> 02:02:40.516
He's crazy.

02:02:41.896 --> 02:02:43.807
Oh, god. He's right.

02:02:44.065 --> 02:02:45.851
You're right, Roy.
Just knock it on.

02:02:46.025 --> 02:02:47.356
Let 'er rip!

02:02:47.527 --> 02:02:49.017
Oh, Molly, you're losin' it.

02:02:49.195 --> 02:02:51.607
No, I have lost it,
and so has he.

02:02:54.242 --> 02:02:54.901
He's crazy.

02:02:55.076 --> 02:02:56.156
Honey, so are you.

02:02:56.202 --> 02:02:58.363
11. Now this is a 12, guys.

02:02:58.580 --> 02:03:00.307
Now he's gotta start worrying
about qualifying

02:03:00.331 --> 02:03:02.367
for next year's open
and the masters here.

02:03:02.542 --> 02:03:03.742
But he's lost this tournament.

02:03:03.877 --> 02:03:06.289
He'll end up selling
countess Mara ties

02:03:06.462 --> 02:03:08.828
and renting golf carts
the rest of his life. Look at this!

02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:11.277
I... I don't know...
Even know what I'm feeling, all right.

02:03:11.301 --> 02:03:13.101
This is the most painful thing
I've ever seen.

02:03:13.261 --> 02:03:14.501
You know what's crazy, Jimmy?

02:03:14.679 --> 02:03:16.510
If he doesn't finish the hole
with this ball,

02:03:16.890 --> 02:03:19.302
he can't turn in a card.
He's disqualified.

02:03:19.517 --> 02:03:20.744
Oh, my god.

02:03:20.768 --> 02:03:22.554
Oh, dear lord, please.
Oh, dear lord.

02:03:36.284 --> 02:03:39.151
Get up! Get up! Come on, baby!

02:03:39.329 --> 02:03:40.990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:03:41.623 --> 02:03:43.739
Jj

02:03:45.126 --> 02:03:46.126
There it goes!

02:03:46.544 --> 02:03:47.544
Get over.

02:03:49.797 --> 02:03:51.082
There ya go!

02:03:51.382 --> 02:03:53.748
Jj

02:03:53.927 --> 02:03:54.927
He's over.

02:04:18.493 --> 02:04:19.493
No!

02:04:19.619 --> 02:04:20.619
Jj

02:04:22.914 --> 02:04:24.450
I can't believe it!

02:04:27.168 --> 02:04:28.704
I love you!

02:04:30.838 --> 02:04:31.838
Come on!

02:04:38.846 --> 02:04:42.555
Jj

02:04:47.647 --> 02:04:48.386
Unbelievable!

02:04:48.564 --> 02:04:49.770
Jesus Christ!

02:04:49.941 --> 02:04:51.647
Did you see this? What was that?

02:04:53.194 --> 02:04:55.560
That was a 12. That was a 12.

02:04:55.738 --> 02:04:58.150
He was on the green, on in 12.

02:05:06.207 --> 02:05:08.368
Jj

02:05:16.050 --> 02:05:19.588
Jj

02:06:02.555 --> 02:06:04.511
Well, boss, we blew that one.

02:06:04.766 --> 02:06:06.757
I didn't come here
to play for no second, Romeo.

02:06:06.934 --> 02:06:08.774
And Simms will always be second.

02:06:13.441 --> 02:06:15.352
Hey, meet you back
at the winnebago, man.

02:06:15.526 --> 02:06:16.811
I'll get the blender fired up!

02:06:18.404 --> 02:06:19.940
Yeah. Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you.

02:06:20.615 --> 02:06:22.355
I just gave away the us open.

02:06:24.202 --> 02:06:25.988
Excuse me. Roy!

02:06:26.662 --> 02:06:27.662
Roy!

02:06:28.247 --> 02:06:29.703
That was incredible!

02:06:30.124 --> 02:06:32.536
That was the shot
of this tournament! My god!

02:06:32.710 --> 02:06:35.147
- Did you hear the people...
- Molly, I just gave away the us open.

02:06:35.171 --> 02:06:36.690
- I mean...
- Oh, hell, Roy. It doesn't matter.

02:06:36.714 --> 02:06:37.714
Molly, I just...

02:06:37.799 --> 02:06:39.109
- Just give him a minute.
- One time in my life,

02:06:39.133 --> 02:06:40.714
I know the safe place
to hit the lay-up,

02:06:40.885 --> 02:06:42.341
and I still... shit!

02:06:42.512 --> 02:06:44.239
I still can't make myself do it.

02:06:44.263 --> 02:06:45.783
- It doesn't matter, Roy.
- My whole career,

02:06:45.807 --> 02:06:47.468
my whole life on the line,
and I...

02:06:48.392 --> 02:06:51.225
I just made a 12 on the last hole
of the us open!

02:06:51.395 --> 02:06:52.456
That's right, you sure did, Roy,

02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:54.391
and it was
the greatest 12 of all time!

02:06:54.857 --> 02:06:57.143
No one's gonna remember the open
five years from now...

02:06:57.318 --> 02:06:58.057
Who won, who lost...

02:06:58.236 --> 02:06:59.897
But they're gonna
remember your 12!

02:07:00.321 --> 02:07:01.777
My god, Roy! It was...

02:07:02.198 --> 02:07:03.483
Why, it's immortal!

02:07:03.699 --> 02:07:05.439
I am so proud of you!

02:07:10.164 --> 02:07:11.654
I gotta hand it to you, Roy.

02:07:12.208 --> 02:07:15.325
When you go down,
you go down in flames.

02:07:15.628 --> 02:07:17.459
Roy, never mind what...

02:07:17.630 --> 02:07:19.370
Roy... kiss me.

02:07:21.092 --> 02:07:22.252
Hey, David, you got a minute?

02:07:22.385 --> 02:07:24.671
- Not right now.
- David! David!

02:07:25.096 --> 02:07:26.506
Can I have your autograph?

02:07:26.973 --> 02:07:29.430
Sure. I always got time
for my fans, darlin'.

02:07:29.684 --> 02:07:31.845
Well, don't you look cute.
Come on under.

02:07:39.569 --> 02:07:41.184
Nice par, David.

02:07:44.198 --> 02:07:47.611
Jj

02:08:26.949 --> 02:08:30.282
Hey, do you know that by
finishing in the top 15 at the open,

02:08:30.453 --> 02:08:31.989
you qualified to be
in it next year?

02:08:33.497 --> 02:08:34.828
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

02:08:36.292 --> 02:08:37.122
I didn't know that.

02:08:37.293 --> 02:08:39.534
Yeah, so I'm thinkin'
with your game,

02:08:39.712 --> 02:08:42.294
you could go back to the qualifying
school and go out on tour.

02:08:44.050 --> 02:08:45.050
Nah.

02:08:45.426 --> 02:08:46.541
Then I wouldn't see you.

02:08:47.637 --> 02:08:49.037
Uh, well, actually,

02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:51.762
I picked up a whole bunch
of new clients at the open.

02:08:52.183 --> 02:08:54.663
A lot of the guys on tour
said if I could do that much for you,

02:08:54.727 --> 02:08:56.007
imagine what
I could do for them.

02:08:58.397 --> 02:09:00.388
Yeah, there's a lotta
head cases out there.

02:09:01.859 --> 02:09:04.087
You know, a man goes through
what I've gone through,

02:09:04.111 --> 02:09:05.442
he's supposed
to learn somethin'.

02:09:05.905 --> 02:09:07.465
I'm tryin' to figure out
what I learned.

02:09:11.953 --> 02:09:12.953
Oh, yeah.

02:09:13.329 --> 02:09:16.036
I mean, you learned a little discipline,
a little self-control.

02:09:16.499 --> 02:09:17.784
Yeah. I learned, uh...

02:09:18.292 --> 02:09:19.478
You can't just listen
to your heart.

02:09:19.502 --> 02:09:21.914
Ya gotta...
Listen to your brain.

02:09:22.380 --> 02:09:24.746
I'm learning how to listen
to that tuning fork,

02:09:25.258 --> 02:09:26.498
throw caution to the wind,

02:09:26.676 --> 02:09:30.385
and take crazy risks that
I never thought were possible.

02:09:31.389 --> 02:09:32.094
Aw, come on, Molly,

02:09:32.265 --> 02:09:34.221
when did you ever
take a crazy risk?

02:09:35.601 --> 02:09:36.966
Well, I'm with you, Roy.

02:09:40.773 --> 02:09:41.773
I'm with you.

02:09:44.902 --> 02:09:45.902
Yeah.

02:09:46.821 --> 02:09:47.821
You know, Roy...

02:09:48.739 --> 02:09:50.149
We could kiss.

02:09:52.159 --> 02:09:55.151
You mean like a...
No-harm, no-foul kiss?

02:09:55.329 --> 02:09:58.162
Yeah, kind of
