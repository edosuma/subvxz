WEBVTT

01:19.689 --> 01:21.399
But what's Camilla's motive?

01:22.107 --> 01:25.444
The same as all the others.
Money and power.

01:25.444 --> 01:28.948
- But who's to say Lydell isn't lying?
- Della, the man had a gun to my chest.

01:28.948 --> 01:30.824
It wasn't the other way around.
He's not lying.

01:30.824 --> 01:33.410
It was his son, his cargo ships,
his trying to stop you--

01:33.410 --> 01:35.705
You're in denial. You're in...

01:38.833 --> 01:40.835
Oh, Della, my wife, Clara.

01:41.460 --> 01:44.631
- How do you do?
- Can we bring you something?

01:44.631 --> 01:46.216
A smoke would be nice.

01:49.094 --> 01:50.344
Here.

01:57.435 --> 02:00.145
What Clara snatched
from inside the house.

02:03.232 --> 02:06.069
Maybe this will make you believe Lydell.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.238
Melville Phipps.

02:08.905 --> 02:11.031
His wife, Constance, she's our junkie.

02:12.701 --> 02:15.203
Constance Barbour? The pianist?

02:15.537 --> 02:18.665
Went down just like Ozzie said.
Clara and I saw it all.

02:18.665 --> 02:19.958
More than I needed to.

02:23.168 --> 02:24.211
But Camilla's...

02:29.092 --> 02:30.050
Fuck!

02:32.845 --> 02:33.887
Who's Camilla?

02:34.723 --> 02:37.349
She's who Phipps works for.
He's her attorney.

02:37.349 --> 02:39.686
She ordered Phipps
to arrange the murder.

02:40.019 --> 02:41.730
So how do you want to play this with her?

02:41.730 --> 02:46.108
You can't play this with her. She's too
smart. She's not gonna be intimidated.

02:46.609 --> 02:49.362
I think we should take everything
we have and go straight to Burger.

02:49.362 --> 02:50.779
I agree.

02:51.865 --> 02:53.533
We might need another way.

02:53.533 --> 02:56.744
Della, there isn't another way.
Durkin is ruling tomorrow morning.

02:56.744 --> 03:00.624
There's a reason
Burger won't deal with us.

03:01.749 --> 03:02.791
And that is?

03:05.295 --> 03:06.378
I can't say.

03:06.378 --> 03:10.342
You can't just tell us the one person
who could possibly save this trial...

03:10.675 --> 03:12.844
won't, and then not explain why.

03:18.225 --> 03:20.185
Burger's being blackmailed,

03:21.310 --> 03:23.938
and now we all know who by.

03:25.273 --> 03:26.482
What's she got on him?

03:28.068 --> 03:29.068
Photos.

03:30.194 --> 03:31.237
Of?

03:32.029 --> 03:32.989
Come on.

03:35.449 --> 03:38.744
Okay, your word
that this never leaves this room.

03:39.912 --> 03:40.914
You've got it.

03:42.706 --> 03:44.292
Photos of him...

03:46.836 --> 03:49.256
No, you're gonna judge him. I'm not...

03:51.382 --> 03:52.384
With another man.

03:56.555 --> 04:00.850
Durkin is ruling in eight hours. What
the fuck are we supposed to do now?

04:01.726 --> 04:02.811
We need more time.

04:06.563 --> 04:09.817
I still feel that some of the language
in the brief could be a little stronger,

04:09.817 --> 04:11.318
but it'll get the job done.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.823
Have you decided who you're putting
on the Broderick case?

04:14.823 --> 04:15.948
Not yet.

04:16.491 --> 04:18.158
It'll be a good follow-up
once this is done.

04:18.827 --> 04:19.952
I think I've more than earned it.

04:19.952 --> 04:24.456
Although, I did promise Mary
and the kids a couple days at the beach.

04:30.796 --> 04:32.716
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

04:33.174 --> 04:35.009
How'd you find out about the gun?

04:36.719 --> 04:39.097
Had one of our snoops
break into Mason's office.

04:39.431 --> 04:42.641
I hate to admit it,
but you were right about Mason.

04:43.184 --> 04:44.852
He is shrewd, boy.

04:46.771 --> 04:48.940
Well, clearly not as shrewd as you.

04:49.399 --> 04:51.567
That's why we're gonna win this thing.

04:52.527 --> 04:54.279
And I'm glad about that.

04:55.362 --> 04:58.200
But it was a risky move on your part.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.994
You could have jeopardized this office.

05:01.994 --> 05:03.245
Yeah, but I didn't.

05:06.248 --> 05:07.875
It's the job, isn't it?

05:59.261 --> 06:04.056
That book you were reading,
The Good Earth.

06:06.893 --> 06:08.936
Was it a happy ending?

06:16.069 --> 06:18.821
You'll find out in my chambers
in half an hour.

06:18.821 --> 06:21.115
- Of course. Understood.
- Yes.

06:23.285 --> 06:24.327
Can I speak off the record?

06:24.327 --> 06:27.496
I'm not a fan
of ex parte communications, Mr. Mason.

06:27.496 --> 06:29.123
I know, I know that.

06:29.123 --> 06:32.459
I also know you've put up
with a lot of crap during this trial,

06:32.459 --> 06:36.214
and I just wanted to say how grateful
I am to you for being so fair.

06:36.214 --> 06:38.174
Well, if you didn't know...

06:38.550 --> 06:41.344
being fair is a small detail
of a judge's oath.

06:43.929 --> 06:47.308
I think you see the benefit
of allowing this trial to continue

06:47.308 --> 06:49.852
for these boys with competent counsel.

06:50.353 --> 06:55.358
Be a bit difficult to include you in that
category currently, wouldn't you agree?

06:55.358 --> 06:58.612
I still insist that I'm their best option

06:58.612 --> 07:02.573
because no public defender
will fight as hard for them as I have.

07:04.367 --> 07:07.537
However, I also believe
that I deserve some other...

07:08.455 --> 07:11.165
kind of punishment
that the court sees fit.

07:22.344 --> 07:23.386
Here.

07:25.763 --> 07:28.475
This one, he needs a little polish.

07:41.321 --> 07:42.989
- Hello?
- Phippsy, where have you been?

07:42.989 --> 07:44.657
<i>I've been calling since this morning.
You left...</i>

07:44.657 --> 07:46.492
I'm sorry, I was up half the night.

07:46.492 --> 07:49.120
<i>You left out several points on the
Ulrich deal which we need to discuss.</i>

07:49.120 --> 07:50.830
I don't have the Ulrich file
in front of me.

07:50.830 --> 07:53.375
<i>- The agreed upon acreage is...
- I can ask them that.</i>

07:53.375 --> 07:55.377
And where's the copy of the covenants?

07:55.377 --> 07:58.964
- Yeah, let me get a pad and pen.
- I just want to make changes.

08:07.430 --> 08:09.223
- Go ahead.
- The agreed upon acreage has...

08:25.240 --> 08:26.199
Shit.

08:27.992 --> 08:29.368
And I won't blame you if you run.

08:30.286 --> 08:31.704
That's what a punk does.

08:32.955 --> 08:34.416
Never took you for one.

08:35.542 --> 08:38.294
We both know the street's got rules.
I broke them.

08:38.712 --> 08:40.547
- Got what's mine.
- Yeah.

08:42.131 --> 08:44.050
Game ain't never gonna be fair.

08:44.883 --> 08:46.302
Not for us, down here.

08:47.803 --> 08:48.846
Is what it is.

08:49.513 --> 08:50.515
You're right.

08:51.473 --> 08:52.475
You're right.

08:58.731 --> 08:59.773
That it, then?

09:00.609 --> 09:03.527
No, no, no.
I got one little piece of business.

09:06.323 --> 09:07.573
Why would I help you?

09:09.283 --> 09:10.911
You'd be helping yourself.

09:18.542 --> 09:21.921
Well, I was prepared
to declare a mistrial,

09:22.796 --> 09:24.256
but I have reconsidered.

09:25.299 --> 09:26.426
The trial will continue.

09:26.426 --> 09:30.555
The gun will be admitted with no mention
as to how it was obtained.

09:30.555 --> 09:33.891
Your Honor, in lieu of mentioning
the gun was locked in Mr. Mason's safe,

09:33.891 --> 09:36.143
I'd like to provide a location
for the jury

09:36.143 --> 09:37.394
that connects the gun to the defendants.

09:37.394 --> 09:39.064
That's not in the brief.

09:39.064 --> 09:41.065
Has she completely taken over
the practice now, Mason?

09:41.065 --> 09:43.400
- Why, does that scare you?
- Enough.

09:44.528 --> 09:47.196
Mr. Milligan's request seems reasonable.

09:48.073 --> 09:50.283
Where did the gun come from,
Mr. Mason?

09:51.326 --> 09:53.077
- The Hooverville.
- Any more specifics?

09:53.411 --> 09:55.162
No, that's specific enough.

09:57.081 --> 09:58.208
Once the trial is concluded,

09:58.208 --> 10:02.879
Mr. Mason will plead guilty
to Penal Code 135, concealing evidence,

10:02.879 --> 10:05.507
and be sentenced
to four months in county jail.

10:05.507 --> 10:08.510
Your Honor, that charge
seems a little excessive.

10:09.553 --> 10:14.682
I think it's fair and fit,
don't you, Mr. Mason?

10:16.726 --> 10:17.769
I do.

10:18.352 --> 10:20.522
The state will be granted
two additional witnesses.

10:20.522 --> 10:23.065
Let's keep this thing short and sweet.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.943
Mr. Mason, it should go without saying,

10:24.943 --> 10:26.736
it's likely in your best interest

10:26.736 --> 10:30.197
to avoid cross-examining
either of these witnesses, huh?

10:30.614 --> 10:33.285
Does this plan suit the prosecution?

10:33.701 --> 10:35.078
It does, Your Honor.

10:35.912 --> 10:37.621
Can you line up witnesses
for the top of the week?

10:37.621 --> 10:40.458
- I believe so.
- Fine. We're back in session.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.627
Monday morning, 9:00 a.m.

10:44.128 --> 10:45.212
Perry...

10:45.212 --> 10:47.090
- What you just did in there--
- Yeah.

10:47.965 --> 10:49.758
- It was--
- Don't. It's okay.

10:50.801 --> 10:51.803
It...

10:52.721 --> 10:54.722
It buys us some time
to get those pictures.

10:59.393 --> 11:00.436
Come on.

11:05.941 --> 11:07.527
Let's get her into a bath.

11:09.987 --> 11:11.072
I'm sorry.

11:12.031 --> 11:14.241
- It's all right.
- Phippsy.

11:15.159 --> 11:16.703
Did you hear something?

11:18.454 --> 11:20.789
Oh, Phippsy!

11:25.045 --> 11:26.087
What are you doing?

11:26.087 --> 11:29.174
We thought you might be busy,
so we let ourselves in.

11:29.841 --> 11:30.884
I have a gun.

11:30.884 --> 11:34.845
Yeah, so do I. Look, mine's right here.
How far away is yours?

11:35.930 --> 11:37.891
- Well?
- We know everything.

11:37.891 --> 11:41.436
And we'd like the photographs and
the negatives that you have on Burger.

11:41.811 --> 11:44.564
- Excuse me?
- We know Camilla is blackmailing him.

11:44.564 --> 11:47.775
And we have Ozzie Jackson,
who's agreed to testify against you.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.277
All it took for Ozzie to agree

11:49.277 --> 11:52.405
was the same persuasive tactics
you used on him.

11:56.159 --> 11:57.117
You're amateurs.

11:58.119 --> 11:59.329
It will never stick.

12:04.125 --> 12:05.418
Phippsy...

12:06.878 --> 12:07.921
you're grasping.

12:08.922 --> 12:10.006
Melville!

12:13.093 --> 12:16.096
Your wife doesn't sound too good.
Seems like she might need you around.

12:16.096 --> 12:17.638
You shut your mouth!

12:20.141 --> 12:21.141
Darling!

12:26.773 --> 12:27.816
Come on.

12:32.236 --> 12:33.362
I'm not a murderer.

12:34.739 --> 12:38.200
I was just doing my job,
like I've always done for her.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.328
You've clearly been nothing
but a loyal advocate to Camilla.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.789
But where's that loyalty got you, Phipps?

12:44.416 --> 12:45.499
It got you here,

12:45.874 --> 12:49.128
fully exposed, about to be indicted,
and no one here to protect you.

12:49.504 --> 12:50.630
Or Constance.

12:54.551 --> 12:55.801
Fuck!

12:58.429 --> 12:59.514
Work with us.

13:07.188 --> 13:08.398
What does that mean?

13:22.996 --> 13:24.622
How are you both holding up?

13:25.290 --> 13:27.458
Okay. Anxious.

13:28.084 --> 13:31.879
Monday will probably
be our last day in court.

13:31.879 --> 13:34.632
So, we just wanted to fill you in
on the proceedings.

13:34.632 --> 13:35.759
The gun will be admitted,

13:35.759 --> 13:38.552
but they don't know anything
about Twist renting it to you.

13:38.552 --> 13:39.763
That won't come up.

13:39.763 --> 13:43.308
Which means they can't directly
connect the gun to you.

13:44.266 --> 13:45.559
This is a good thing.

13:48.354 --> 13:51.440
Can I ask you something?
About if we lose...

13:51.440 --> 13:54.193
- We can appeal.
- No, not about that. Just...

13:57.571 --> 13:59.574
Do you know how to write a will?

14:01.867 --> 14:05.455
Yes. Well, yes,
we have experience with that.

14:07.456 --> 14:08.916
Can you do one for me?

14:11.962 --> 14:13.004
Of course.

14:15.924 --> 14:17.549
I just had wishes for Maria.

14:20.178 --> 14:21.428
I want one too.

14:23.348 --> 14:26.184
Just saying you make sure our bodies
are brought back to our family

14:26.184 --> 14:27.602
after we're hung.

14:31.230 --> 14:35.401
That way they have something to visit
instead of some mass grave.

14:42.783 --> 14:45.078
We can write up whatever you want.

14:45.911 --> 14:47.038
Thank you.

14:59.301 --> 15:01.219
- Good morning.
- You got a minute?

15:02.761 --> 15:04.139
Not really, no.

15:06.640 --> 15:07.725
You kept your word.

15:08.518 --> 15:10.978
You kept out of sight during my trial.

15:12.938 --> 15:14.566
You like our neighborhood?

15:14.982 --> 15:16.066
Could be better.

15:17.152 --> 15:19.320
Well, I'm looking to change that.

15:19.863 --> 15:23.158
I want to build a park,
a public pool.

15:23.658 --> 15:27.204
- Give us our own utopia.
- Why are you telling me this?

15:27.204 --> 15:29.122
Because to do any of that,

15:29.580 --> 15:31.333
I need a man of your skills.

15:33.043 --> 15:36.503
You need a man
with my set of skills to do what?

15:41.509 --> 15:46.013
These are the home addresses of all the
city councilmen that stand in our way.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.598
Dig up whatever you can.

15:48.474 --> 15:49.851
Help persuade them crackers.

15:50.851 --> 15:52.062
Get zoning permits.

15:52.811 --> 15:54.272
Do good for our people.

16:31.685 --> 16:34.103
Officer Champlin,
what department do you work in?

16:34.103 --> 16:35.772
In the evidence locker.

16:35.772 --> 16:40.609
Would you please read for the jury
the location in which this gun was found?

16:41.527 --> 16:43.904
On the corner
of 85th and Lou Dillion Street.

16:43.904 --> 16:47.325
- 85th and Lou Dillion. And what's there?
- A Hooverville.

16:47.325 --> 16:50.871
The same Hooverville
in which the Gallardo brothers resided.

16:54.456 --> 16:57.752
- Mr. Mason?
- No, no, no questions, Your Honor.

16:57.752 --> 17:00.588
How many tests did your laboratory
conduct on the gun, Mr. Farkas?

17:00.588 --> 17:04.426
We did a series of 20 firings
of the gun in a controlled environment.

17:04.426 --> 17:05.886
What did each of these tests reveal?

17:05.886 --> 17:08.346
The ballistics
from every single bullet fired

17:08.346 --> 17:12.392
was an exact match for the bullet
that killed Brooks McCutcheon.

17:16.438 --> 17:17.480
Thank you.

17:21.610 --> 17:24.528
Brooks McCutcheon
didn't murder himself.

17:25.321 --> 17:26.405
The defense

17:26.990 --> 17:30.159
made a desperate and unsavory attempt
to paint him as a villain,

17:30.159 --> 17:34.122
but regardless, no matter what opinions
you may have formed about him,

17:35.081 --> 17:37.082
we are here right now

17:38.125 --> 17:39.711
because he was a victim.

17:41.128 --> 17:45.549
Rafael and Mateo Gallardo murdered
Brooks McCutcheon in cold blood.

17:46.509 --> 17:49.596
Two Mexicans,
resentful of the more fortunate.

17:49.596 --> 17:53.308
So bitter that they ripped the life
from Brooks McCutcheon

17:53.308 --> 17:56.810
and then discarded it
with as much indifference as his wallet.

17:56.810 --> 17:58.188
Guests in our country.

17:59.064 --> 18:02.359
They were too lazy
to work their way out of hardship.

18:02.359 --> 18:06.654
A hardship that we've all endured
during these trying times,

18:06.654 --> 18:10.408
because law-abiding Americans,
we know something...

18:11.993 --> 18:14.079
that the Gallardos never will.

18:15.914 --> 18:19.292
America is a great country,

18:19.292 --> 18:23.964
and it takes care of those
who are not afraid to work hard.

18:25.632 --> 18:29.093
There are enough substantiated facts
to prove that the Gallardos are guilty.

18:29.093 --> 18:32.639
Eyewitness testimony, the evidence of a
murder weapon, and where it was found.

18:32.639 --> 18:36.851
It is your duty to make an example

18:36.851 --> 18:41.982
of those who take the easy,
hateful, and destructive way out.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.529
Return the verdict of guilty.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.197
Thank you.

18:56.830 --> 18:59.958
Mr. Mason, you may proceed
with your closing argument.

19:05.171 --> 19:11.343
A very well-established attorney here
in Los Angeles once said to me...

19:13.305 --> 19:17.391
"There's no such thing as justice."
"There's only the illusion of justice."

19:17.891 --> 19:19.561
Now, this case
has been laid out before you.

19:19.561 --> 19:22.563
You have all the information
you need to reach a verdict.

19:22.563 --> 19:27.484
But if we're gonna be truthful,
honest with each other for just a moment,

19:28.319 --> 19:30.280
you, ladies and gentlemen,

19:30.280 --> 19:34.618
had predetermined views
when you swore an oath to be impartial,

19:35.034 --> 19:38.454
and that's not an indictment.
That's merely a fact.

19:38.454 --> 19:41.790
Because every instant of our life,

19:41.790 --> 19:46.003
our wealth, our poverty, our race,
our passions

19:46.379 --> 19:51.467
predetermine how people perceive us
and our actions.

19:53.178 --> 19:54.595
Now, if that is true...

19:56.765 --> 19:59.684
is real justice possible,
or is it just an illusion?

20:00.518 --> 20:05.190
All I ask is that you bear that in mind
in reaching a decision.

20:07.525 --> 20:10.946
For the reception, I want
the citrus supreme and the broiled filet.

20:10.946 --> 20:15.367
I want an assortment of citrus this time,
not just the grapefruit.

21:21.057 --> 21:23.559
I didn't think you were coming today.

21:26.103 --> 21:28.648
Just getting the new contracts
to review at home.

21:31.401 --> 21:34.279
Did you reach our friend
at the federal office?

21:34.821 --> 21:39.075
All files related
to the Brooks McCutcheon investigation

21:39.909 --> 21:41.578
have been taken care of.

21:42.120 --> 21:43.663
And the chatty employee?

21:44.914 --> 21:46.333
Same as the files.

21:48.584 --> 21:51.420
How's Constance?
Has Dr. Evans been helpful?

21:51.838 --> 21:56.091
I don't know that his treatment
has been helping much yet--

21:56.091 --> 21:58.218
Don't get dismissive so soon.

21:58.218 --> 22:02.265
Dr. Evans may be unconventional,
but that's why he's effective.

22:02.265 --> 22:07.019
It's not as if anything else you've tried
with Constance has worked, has it now?

22:08.562 --> 22:10.648
- No.
- You should have seen this coming.

22:11.024 --> 22:13.233
She always gets like this
before a concert.

22:13.233 --> 22:17.696
It's selfish in a way, considering
how much goes into these evenings.

22:17.696 --> 22:22.201
It was the only bright spot for me
with everything else that's going on.

22:22.910 --> 22:25.287
Well, hopefully we can salvage it.

22:25.956 --> 22:28.666
- They're ready to fit the dress on you.
- Thank you, Louise.

22:28.666 --> 22:30.669
- In the Blue Room, yes?
- Yes, of course.

22:31.211 --> 22:33.296
Do you remember the name
of the orchids

22:33.296 --> 22:34.756
Ambassador Debuchi brought me?

22:37.758 --> 22:40.386
- Tiger's Mouth.
- Of course.

22:41.054 --> 22:43.348
I think I'll order some for the recital.

23:00.657 --> 23:03.659
Mr. Phipps called six times
in the last hour.

23:25.264 --> 23:27.225
These are all pictures of Burger?

23:28.392 --> 23:29.351
No.

23:42.740 --> 23:44.825
Who doesn't she have pictures of?

24:17.900 --> 24:20.403
That's everything Camilla had on you.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.363
We made sure of it.

24:25.699 --> 24:30.120
I thought I made it clear, Della,
I did not want your involvement in this.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.248
I know, and I'm sorry.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.502
But... you're free.

24:37.920 --> 24:38.922
"Free..."

24:40.881 --> 24:42.716
You know better than that.

24:45.010 --> 24:46.095
So now you know.

24:47.638 --> 24:49.181
- I don't care.
- I do.

24:49.181 --> 24:52.686
The pictures and the negatives
are yours no matter what.

24:54.395 --> 24:58.524
We also have proof
that Camilla's behind Brooks' murder.

24:58.524 --> 25:00.527
A direct line from her to the brothers.

25:00.527 --> 25:02.194
And with the federal investigation,

25:02.194 --> 25:06.115
which has yet to even scratch
the surface of the real conspiracy.

25:06.115 --> 25:07.992
This is all yours to open up,
whatever investig--

25:07.992 --> 25:12.955
I'm... grateful for what you did for me.

25:14.791 --> 25:16.668
But I'm still the DA of this city.

25:17.376 --> 25:19.754
A city that has been reminded
of this crime

25:19.754 --> 25:22.173
on the radio, in the papers, every day.

25:23.174 --> 25:24.551
Someone has to pay for it.

25:24.551 --> 25:27.469
Ham, we are handing you this
on a platter.

25:27.469 --> 25:29.888
You could open up
a massive criminal investigation.

25:29.888 --> 25:31.016
At the center of which

25:31.016 --> 25:33.560
would be the woman
who tried to own you with blackmail.

25:41.484 --> 25:42.444
All right.

25:45.195 --> 25:47.573
Only one of them pulled the trigger...

25:48.032 --> 25:50.785
so if he confesses...

25:52.662 --> 25:54.748
I'll drop the charges on the other.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.378
Fifteen years for the one
who pleads guilty.

26:01.921 --> 26:03.464
- Life.
- Thirty.

26:04.090 --> 26:06.760
But no parole.
That's the best I can do.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.928
- Twenty.
- Della. Okay, all right.

26:09.346 --> 26:10.889
We'll talk to the brothers.

26:13.558 --> 26:14.601
Thank you.

26:49.593 --> 26:53.264
- Hello, Ms. Street, Mr. Mason.
- Hello.

26:53.264 --> 26:55.183
It's nice to see you all together.

26:55.976 --> 26:57.561
We know
you're in the middle of your visit--

26:57.561 --> 26:59.646
But we need to talk to you now.

27:00.354 --> 27:01.855
The DA has come back with a...

27:03.525 --> 27:04.692
much better deal.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.444
How much better?

27:06.444 --> 27:08.612
He's agreed to drop the charges
for one of you.

27:09.781 --> 27:10.907
- One of us?
- Yeah.

27:11.908 --> 27:15.452
- And the other one?
- Plead guilty with a 30-year sentence.

27:17.414 --> 27:18.456
Parole?

27:19.958 --> 27:20.916
No.

27:30.135 --> 27:31.635
- You're gonna get out of here.
- No.

27:32.094 --> 27:35.348
It should be you.
You have Sofía, you have Maria.

27:35.348 --> 27:36.933
I'll still have them.

27:37.891 --> 27:39.101
Yes.

27:44.691 --> 27:46.026
It's time to end this.

27:59.581 --> 28:01.332
- Verdict come in yet?
- No.

28:02.291 --> 28:04.668
Okay. Why did you want to see me?

28:04.668 --> 28:09.632
I'm taking you off the Gallardo case.
You're not needed anymore.

28:13.260 --> 28:16.388
The jury is about to deliver
a verdict in our favor.

28:16.388 --> 28:19.726
Verdict is irrelevant now.
I made a deal with Mason.

28:21.644 --> 28:23.228
I'm sorry, you made a deal?

28:23.228 --> 28:26.691
Mateo Gallardo is pleading guilty
with an agreed-upon sentence.

28:26.691 --> 28:28.860
Rafael Gallardo is going free.

28:32.529 --> 28:34.657
- Is this some sort of joke?
- Hardly.

28:36.784 --> 28:38.703
Why would you go behind my back?

28:40.205 --> 28:43.333
- I'm the DA.
- And I won the fucking case.

28:45.752 --> 28:46.961
Goodbye, Tommy.

28:50.547 --> 28:51.632
This is bullshit.

29:04.813 --> 29:06.146
It has been brought to my attention

29:06.146 --> 29:09.024
that the defense and prosecution
have reached an agreement.

29:09.858 --> 29:13.988
Mateo Gallardo, will you please stand
and address the court?

29:16.073 --> 29:19.702
Mateo Gallardo,
you've previously pled not guilty

29:19.702 --> 29:22.205
to the murder of Brooks McCutcheon
in the first degree.

29:22.663 --> 29:24.583
How do you wish to plead now?

29:24.999 --> 29:26.167
Guilty, Your Honor.

29:26.500 --> 29:29.628
Your Honor, my client would like to give
a brief statement, if that's possible.

29:29.962 --> 29:31.005
Go ahead.

29:41.558 --> 29:44.518
Today I stand before you
to let it be known...

29:46.353 --> 29:48.857
that I alone shot
and killed Brooks McCutcheon,

29:48.857 --> 29:50.774
and I alone shall pay the price.

29:51.358 --> 29:52.860
You'll get it, Bake.
We're not out of this.

29:52.860 --> 29:54.987
We can have the Governor
invite them out.

29:54.987 --> 29:59.534
Do a whole tour. Make it first class,
have the owners see it all for themselves.

29:59.534 --> 30:02.036
- Sure.
- Yeah, might turn the trick.

30:02.662 --> 30:03.955
We'll talk about it.

30:05.707 --> 30:08.919
- Hey. Hey. We don't have to do this.
- I got it.

30:13.882 --> 30:14.841
Bake.

30:15.926 --> 30:16.884
Bake!

30:26.268 --> 30:29.104
<i>I know there's no excuse
for killing a man.</i>

30:30.606 --> 30:33.193
Do I wish things
had been different for me?

30:33.734 --> 30:34.694
Of course.

30:35.695 --> 30:37.988
More food to eat. A real home.

30:38.989 --> 30:40.742
But none of those things can compare

30:41.701 --> 30:44.663
to the feeling one gets
from the love and loyalty of family.

30:46.748 --> 30:49.208
We may have come
from different worlds...

30:50.459 --> 30:53.879
but I think it's the one thing that we can
both agree is the most important in life.

30:57.968 --> 31:00.470
I am truly sorry
for robbing that from you.

31:07.811 --> 31:09.561
If you will remain standing.

31:10.312 --> 31:12.940
Will the other defendant please rise?

31:16.819 --> 31:17.988
Mateo Gallardo,

31:18.862 --> 31:22.409
you are hereby sentenced
to 30 years in state prison.

31:23.451 --> 31:25.911
Pursuant to Penal Code 1202,

31:25.911 --> 31:29.499
you will be taken to the warden
of the state prison at San Quentin.

31:30.458 --> 31:33.587
Rafael Gallardo, you are hereby
dismissed from this proceeding...

31:33.587 --> 31:34.795
It's all right. It's okay.

31:34.795 --> 31:36.506
...and immediately discharged
from custody.

31:36.839 --> 31:38.550
This court is now adjourned.

31:40.843 --> 31:41.802
Mateo...

31:43.137 --> 31:45.514
- I love you.
- Me too.

31:54.648 --> 31:58.320
My office is very satisfied
with the outcome.

31:58.320 --> 32:00.739
We set out to ensure
that justice was served.

32:01.405 --> 32:02.616
Today, it has been.

32:03.490 --> 32:07.870
It is my great hope
that Mateo Gallardo's conviction

32:08.662 --> 32:11.498
will bring the McCutcheon family
some much-needed solace.

32:11.498 --> 32:14.710
I don't think an internal investigation
into the planting

32:14.710 --> 32:17.881
of Rafael Gallardo's fingerprint
in evidence is out of the question.

32:17.881 --> 32:21.467
- Are you upset about losing?
- I honestly don't see it as a loss.

32:21.926 --> 32:24.429
We did what we had to do.
And we did it as best we could.

32:24.429 --> 32:26.430
But none of this
would have been possible

32:26.430 --> 32:29.935
without the real star of this trial,
which was Ms. Della Street.

32:29.935 --> 32:34.064
Ms. Street, how did it feel
to expose Brooks as a woman strangler?

32:34.438 --> 32:38.777
It's not a pleasant truth, but I'm glad we
were able to speak up for Ms. Lawson

32:38.777 --> 32:40.320
and the other women he mistreated.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.989
Did you find it difficult to be
taken seriously with Councilman Taylor?

32:43.614 --> 32:46.034
Do you find it difficult
to be taken seriously as a reporter?

32:47.826 --> 32:51.121
Miss Street, my sources tell me
you've been seen out on the town

32:51.121 --> 32:52.832
with a special someone.

32:54.291 --> 32:57.796
You've been on the arm of the district
attorney on more than one occasion.

32:57.796 --> 32:59.213
We're old friends.

32:59.213 --> 33:00.547
Well, can you tell the readers,

33:00.547 --> 33:04.260
is there anyone who's more
than an "old friend" in your life?

33:04.594 --> 33:05.845
Currently? No.

33:06.845 --> 33:09.682
But future husbands
are a topic for another day.

33:13.352 --> 33:16.106
Well, Mr. Mason,
that completes our business together.

33:17.231 --> 33:20.651
- Yes. Paul, I will be back.
- I don't need you to be.

33:21.402 --> 33:23.613
Look, this case, Perry,
I sacrificed too much.

33:23.613 --> 33:26.865
With Clara, with Lucius,
and none of it was for them.

33:29.077 --> 33:31.997
I think it's time
I start taking care of my own.

33:33.163 --> 33:34.123
Yes.

33:35.457 --> 33:38.627
Now, you watch out.
She's better at that than you.

33:53.602 --> 33:57.855
I finished up those contracts
for the new Sunny Markets properties.

33:57.855 --> 33:59.940
You just have to sign them before you go.

34:00.566 --> 34:03.402
We made a lot of money out of Sunny

34:09.534 --> 34:13.787
You know what you said in court
about justice being an illusion,

34:13.787 --> 34:15.122
did you mean that?

34:15.540 --> 34:19.335
What I asked was
if real justice was possible.

34:19.335 --> 34:22.339
Perry, look at what we had to do.

34:23.464 --> 34:25.758
We hid a murder weapon,

34:25.758 --> 34:29.929
we pre-arranged a witness, a cop,
to lie on the stand.

34:29.929 --> 34:33.725
Well, that was more like...
half-truths, but go on.

34:33.725 --> 34:36.144
And stopped a blackmail
with another blackmail.

34:36.477 --> 34:39.522
Does any of that add up to real justice?

34:43.817 --> 34:46.070
It's like Sunny's melons.

34:46.988 --> 34:48.073
Excuse me?

34:48.739 --> 34:52.994
Well, we both know
he pumps his melons full of water.

34:53.702 --> 34:55.705
And no one knows
what he's doing in the back room,

34:55.705 --> 34:59.042
but they still get to walk out
with a juicy melon.

35:00.501 --> 35:03.879
It's not justice that's an illusion,
it's the system.

35:03.879 --> 35:05.257
Okay, so...

35:07.634 --> 35:11.136
- What are we supposed to do with that?
- We fight.

35:12.264 --> 35:13.348
Fight?

35:19.186 --> 35:20.146
What?

35:20.605 --> 35:21.648
Nothing.

35:25.402 --> 35:29.405
Is there any place you want
to go tonight, your last night?

35:30.282 --> 35:31.282
My treat.

35:34.118 --> 35:35.704
Right here is just fine.

36:38.057 --> 36:39.768
I'm headed to jail today.

36:41.101 --> 36:42.562
It has to do with the gun.

36:44.688 --> 36:46.650
Turns out the prosecutor had...

36:47.441 --> 36:49.736
Well, had someone break in to my office.

36:51.111 --> 36:52.071
I know.

36:53.781 --> 36:56.784
What was that thing
you said about Los Angeles?

36:58.994 --> 37:01.914
- No one tells you what was...
- Only what can be.

37:08.922 --> 37:12.592
Maybe, eventually,
you could see me that way.

37:21.017 --> 37:22.060
Anyway...

37:26.605 --> 37:27.564
Hey.

37:29.776 --> 37:31.652
When did you say you're getting out?

37:32.404 --> 37:33.362
Four months.

37:35.990 --> 37:37.701
So, it'll be autumn then?

37:38.743 --> 37:39.870
I suppose.

37:41.203 --> 37:44.164
They say Yosemite's lovely
that time of year.

38:20.326 --> 38:21.827
What a lovely surprise.

38:22.162 --> 38:24.581
I just have a few more laps
if you don't mind waiting a moment.

38:24.581 --> 38:26.540
I won't take up much of your time.

38:45.309 --> 38:47.227
Could you hand me a towel, dear?

38:47.646 --> 38:49.189
There's power in the truth.

38:51.149 --> 38:53.067
Isn't that what you said to me?

38:54.319 --> 38:57.112
And what is the "truth"
you came all the way here to share?

38:58.197 --> 38:59.907
I know who you really are.

39:02.910 --> 39:05.621
Your impression of me is too simple,
I can assure you.

39:05.621 --> 39:06.957
Brooks McCutcheon.

39:09.792 --> 39:11.418
It was you, Camilla.

39:17.425 --> 39:18.468
Della...

39:20.428 --> 39:22.721
the way Brooks abused
those women was atrocious.

39:23.098 --> 39:24.558
And what you did in court,

39:24.558 --> 39:28.144
exposing him for all the world to see,
that was very important.

39:28.144 --> 39:31.021
- I'm proud of you--
- I acted on behalf of my clients.

39:31.021 --> 39:33.942
Don't pretend you acted
for the greater good.

39:34.358 --> 39:35.859
Brooks was malignant.

39:37.278 --> 39:41.700
He was a spoiled boy
who ravaged everything he touched.

39:42.491 --> 39:44.118
He had to be taken care of.

39:44.494 --> 39:46.955
And the truth about him
had to come to light.

39:46.955 --> 39:50.709
- You simply finished what I started.
- I can't believe I ever admired you.

39:52.585 --> 39:56.339
- I'm nothing like you.
- Get off your goddamn high horse.

39:57.256 --> 40:01.553
You know, you can say the word
"husband" to the press all day long,

40:01.885 --> 40:03.722
but that is not going to protect you.

40:03.722 --> 40:05.514
You, more than anyone,

40:05.514 --> 40:08.559
should understand
the hard choices we have to make

40:08.559 --> 40:10.979
and the dangers
that ripple out from them.

40:10.979 --> 40:15.482
They ripple and ripple until it catches up
with you and you're drowning.

40:16.442 --> 40:19.446
Camilla Nygaard,
Bureau of Investigation.

40:21.323 --> 40:23.741
We'll meet again, I'm sure.

40:27.245 --> 40:29.664
Until then, good luck to you.

40:33.042 --> 40:35.836
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
If you'd like to step inside,

40:35.836 --> 40:38.673
I'd be happy to answer
any of your questions.

40:43.386 --> 40:44.511
Have you eaten?

40:45.638 --> 40:47.599
Thinkin' about your skills?

40:48.766 --> 40:49.725
No.

40:50.685 --> 40:52.729
You're gonna need something
to trade on.

40:53.271 --> 40:54.563
Yeah, you keep saying.

40:56.565 --> 40:59.069
What was yours, again,
when you were locked up?

41:00.028 --> 41:00.987
Sewing.

41:03.198 --> 41:04.949
- Sewing?
- Yeah, my mother taught me.

41:05.825 --> 41:09.829
You can laugh, but in the joint,
it's gold. Got me a lot of goodwill.

41:09.829 --> 41:12.415
Yeah, I think being an attorney
will be an asset.

41:12.415 --> 41:15.126
No, no, no. No.

41:16.169 --> 41:18.713
If you go blabbing
about being a lawyer in there,

41:19.172 --> 41:22.384
you're gonna have every hard-luck case
knocking on your cell bars,

41:22.384 --> 41:23.634
begging you for help.

41:24.594 --> 41:26.387
Huh? That's what got you here.

41:28.807 --> 41:30.099
You got me here, Pete.

41:31.851 --> 41:32.978
Yeah, fair enough.

41:34.354 --> 41:37.148
Look, I'll make sure
I start your bike once a week.

41:42.362 --> 41:45.323
I tell you I pissed
in Milligan's beloved cognac bottle?

41:46.657 --> 41:48.410
One way of handing in your notice.

41:48.826 --> 41:50.828
À la victoire, asshole.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.378
- I better go.
- Yeah.

41:59.795 --> 42:01.631
Hey, take these.

42:04.134 --> 42:06.136
Actually, you got any Beech-Nut?

42:17.354 --> 42:18.315
So long.

42:21.359 --> 42:23.152
Yeah, I'll see ya around...

42:25.154 --> 42:26.196
fuck-o.

42:37.249 --> 42:41.420
Give him your bag, empty your pockets
in the tray, take off your watch.

44:19.310 --> 44:24.274
To my brilliant Anita
and cameras rolling on her latest opus.

44:24.274 --> 44:27.234
- Well done, darling.
- All thanks to my muse.

44:28.777 --> 44:31.156
You two should come visit set.
That could be fun.

44:31.156 --> 44:34.575
Could introduce you to Cary Grant.
I can introduce Cary Grant to you.

44:35.243 --> 44:37.537
- Picture of the happy couple?
- Yes.

45:03.228 --> 45:06.066
- Paul, Mr. Perkins' office.
- Okay.

45:08.109 --> 45:09.110
Raise that.

45:12.655 --> 45:13.614
Yeah.

45:17.077 --> 45:18.703
Okay, okay, got it.

45:20.747 --> 45:21.914
Heading out now.

45:26.252 --> 45:29.089
- Gotta go.
- You be careful with my husband.

45:35.427 --> 45:38.306
Let's go, Maria,
your father is expecting us.

45:39.474 --> 45:42.351
Tell Mateo I'll see him tomorrow
after class.
