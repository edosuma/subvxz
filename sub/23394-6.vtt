WEBVTT

00:01.793 --> 00:04.001
I'm to inform you
the police have a suspect.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.337
He comes from wealth
and privilege.

00:08.467 --> 00:09.924
Van Bergen is not our killer.

00:10.052 --> 00:13.170
The killer is choosing victims
who somehow remind him

00:13.305 --> 00:16.844
of his own background
and upbringing, his own class.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.058
I almost believe you don't want
the killer found.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.348
It's time to take action.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.767
The Four Hundred are
too important to this city

00:23.899 --> 00:25.561
to suffer the public humiliation

00:25.692 --> 00:28.730
of having one of their own
arrested for murder.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.563
Hand me your weapon.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.109
You're going to regret this.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.904
Our killer might be following
a pattern.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.867
He's following
the Christian calendar.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.703
The next holy day
is the Feast of the Ascension.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.717
Hey!
Watch now!

01:35.846 --> 01:38.429
Come on, Rosie.
The thing's dead.

01:49.526 --> 01:50.687
I ain't no fairy.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.435
Stevie, no one is implying

01:52.571 --> 01:54.173
that you're anything less
than a young man,

01:54.197 --> 01:56.814
but we have an important
undertaking that requires you

01:56.950 --> 01:59.112
to alter your appearance
if it's going to work.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.055
Seems we might have convened
at police headquarters,

02:01.079 --> 02:03.036
judging by how well represented
it is.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.934
Sir, we've asked you here
because we have a plan

02:04.958 --> 02:06.620
that requires
your participation.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.788
Commissioner, I'm sure
Miss Howard has informed you

02:08.919 --> 02:11.280
that Dr. Kreizler believes these
murders are being committed

02:11.381 --> 02:13.192
based upon certain dates
of the Christian calendar.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.216
Where is Dr. Kreizler?

02:14.343 --> 02:15.783
Making arrangements
for this evening.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.961
- What's this evening?
- The Feast of Ascension, sir.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.382
Dr. Kreizler is convinced

02:19.514 --> 02:21.130
the next victim will be taken
tonight.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.007
We're intent on taking up
positions

02:23.143 --> 02:24.930
around two
of the disorderly houses

02:25.062 --> 02:28.430
in hopes that our killer will be
compelled to reveal himself.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.931
You're talking about Van Bergen?

02:30.067 --> 02:32.229
We're talking about
whoever is responsible

02:32.361 --> 02:34.648
for killing four boys
since the new year began.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.152
What exactly is your method
to be?

02:38.283 --> 02:39.899
We plan on using a decoy.

02:44.456 --> 02:45.742
You mean her?

02:45.874 --> 02:47.911
Him, Mr. Roosevelt.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.623
Stevie here is Kreizler's ward,

02:51.755 --> 02:54.589
and will be stationed
in some well-traveled venue

02:54.716 --> 02:56.924
under constant surveillance.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.338
Am I right?

02:58.470 --> 03:01.759
We're going to require full rein
to execute our plan,

03:01.890 --> 03:03.722
which means the police
must not be involved.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.290
Nor informed, as it's certain

03:05.352 --> 03:06.718
they'll not stay quiet about it.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.721
It will also be necessary to
shut down all the boy brothels

03:09.856 --> 03:11.222
in the city save one.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.145
We've chosen the Slide,
right here.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.734
But I cannot be party to...
to <i>this.</i>

03:15.862 --> 03:17.899
The anti-reformers are already
after my head

03:18.031 --> 03:20.444
without me appearing to condone
the dressing of a child

03:20.575 --> 03:21.861
for the express purpose of...

03:21.993 --> 03:23.529
Sex.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.795
It pains me to think
what your father would say

03:26.832 --> 03:28.243
if he heard you talk that way.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.413
Sex is but a three-letter word,
Commissioner.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.421
I trust you are in agreement
with our plan?

03:45.892 --> 03:48.212
Detective Sergeants, you'll have
your weapons at all times.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.143
Most assuredly, sir.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.850
God help us all.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.704
Gentlemen, have you imagined
the logistics

04:08.832 --> 04:10.915
of how we will be able
to accomplish our task?

04:11.042 --> 04:13.955
We calculate it's best
to break into two-man teams,

04:14.087 --> 04:15.623
one on each rooftop.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.373
Our decoy will be on
the street below in plain view.

04:18.507 --> 04:19.868
Hopefully, the killer
makes contact

04:19.926 --> 04:22.418
and we'll be able to move in
swiftly.

04:22.554 --> 04:23.965
What are the teams?

04:24.097 --> 04:26.931
Marcus will take charge
of Mr. Moore, and, uh...

04:30.270 --> 04:31.761
Well, Detective Sergeant?

04:31.897 --> 04:34.935
Miss Howard, I-I'm afraid this
is no task for the weaker sex.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.561
Nor for, um...

04:39.696 --> 04:42.939
Cripples, you mean to say.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.242
Very well, then.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.493
I shall make myself available
throughout the evening

04:47.621 --> 04:49.988
in any capacity that's needed.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.826
Doesn't that still leave us
one shy?

05:46.304 --> 05:48.296
That'll be a nickel.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.673
What the hell?

05:50.809 --> 05:53.142
You heard me, Paddy.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.715
It won't be forever, Willy.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.589
Why do I have to go away?

06:27.721 --> 06:30.885
You can't stay here.
This is only temporary.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.348
We've booked passage for you

06:32.475 --> 06:35.263
on a steamer leaving
early next week.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.012
Where am I going?

06:38.148 --> 06:39.355
To Buenos Aires.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.348
But I don't want to go
to Buenos Aires!

06:41.484 --> 06:46.445
You just... be on that boat
when it sets sail.

06:58.001 --> 07:01.836
It won't be forever, Willy.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.180
Stevie, listen to me.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.801
The man we're looking for
is some 24 to 35 years of age

07:58.937 --> 08:00.974
and is likely to have
a recognizable facial trait.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.098
Yeah.
Mr. Moore said silver teeth.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.849
Possibly.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.602
He'll also likely offer
to take you somewhere.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.194
To live in a castle.
I know.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.154
The point is,
you're to remain alert.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.319
And if you feel in any danger,
no matter who it is,

08:13.451 --> 08:14.595
you're to signal you need help.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.827
- I'll be all right.
- You remember the signal?

08:16.955 --> 08:19.572
Polish my shoe
on the back of my leg.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.040
You mustn't hesitate.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.500
I know how to take care
of myself.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.162
How does he look?

08:27.841 --> 08:28.841
Lovely.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.427
All right, Stevie.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.342
Out you go.
Quickly, now.

08:59.956 --> 09:04.997
Did you know egg creams have
neither eggs nor cream in them?

09:05.128 --> 09:06.335
You mean the man gypped me?

09:06.463 --> 09:08.420
No, no.
It's simply how they're made.

09:08.548 --> 09:13.885
Chocolate syrup,
carbonated water, and milk.

09:15.138 --> 09:18.677
It's rather a mystery as to why
they're called egg creams.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.051
What happened to your hair?

09:22.187 --> 09:23.769
That was a wig.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.183
Oh.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.687
What are you doing
in this neighborhood?

09:30.403 --> 09:32.269
I've come to tell you
that it's important

09:32.405 --> 09:34.613
that you keep your window locked
this evening.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.903
You're worried about
Fatima's saint, aren't you?

09:37.994 --> 09:43.911
We have a suspicion that it may
be tonight that he strikes next.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.118
You know, there are some of us

09:47.253 --> 09:49.791
who don't even believe
he's human.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.880
We think he might be a spirit.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.421
He's most assuredly human.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.344
Where do you call home, Joseph?

10:00.475 --> 10:02.808
I told you...
I work at the Slide now.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.934
I guess what I'm trying to say
is, um,

10:08.066 --> 10:10.649
how long have you been...

10:10.777 --> 10:13.110
Working?
I don't know.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.033
Have you ever thought of doing
something else?

10:21.079 --> 10:22.615
What do you do?

10:23.581 --> 10:24.913
Me?

10:26.084 --> 10:29.327
Well, I'm, um...
I'm an illustrator.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.249
What's that?

10:31.381 --> 10:33.623
I draw pictures.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.875
And people pay you?

10:37.095 --> 10:38.631
Yes.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.674
That's stupid.

10:46.771 --> 10:50.185
Joseph, please, just...

10:50.316 --> 10:54.902
keep your window closed
and locked this evening.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.942
Tell the other boys
to do the same.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.487
That's for his egg cream.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.333
Have I missed anything?

11:59.469 --> 12:01.882
Young Stevie's
just getting started.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.315
You're a sweet thing.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.405
Looks like he's got a bite.

12:25.328 --> 12:26.328
What's your name?

12:26.412 --> 12:30.907
It's, uh... Stella.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.909
Stella.
Stella.

12:35.505 --> 12:39.624
Well, Stella, you certainly are
a pretty young lady.

12:43.304 --> 12:47.594
How would you like to rub up
against me, like a kitten?

12:47.725 --> 12:49.637
Go bugger yourself.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.562
You heard me.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.697
It's 10:23.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.450
I thought perhaps
you'd might want to return home,

13:14.585 --> 13:16.247
as it's getting late.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.713
The commissioner expects me
to be here.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.131
May I ask you a question?

13:29.726 --> 13:32.389
Why do you refer to yourself
as a cripple?

13:36.149 --> 13:39.062
I'm afflicted
with a congenital defect.

13:39.193 --> 13:44.063
My arm... it never fully formed
as it should have.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.359
I hadn't noticed.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.911
Mind that light.

14:14.145 --> 14:17.138
Stevie?
Is that you?

14:17.273 --> 14:18.684
Beansie, get lost.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.854
Why are you wearing a dress?

14:22.362 --> 14:24.570
I'm working for the police,
okay?

14:24.697 --> 14:25.904
Go on.
Get.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.945
Sure, Stevie.
Whatever you say.

14:38.753 --> 14:41.211
I asked you to mind that light.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.001
Yes.
Of course.

15:06.364 --> 15:07.980
Detective Sergeant.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.277
Over there.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.825
Keep an eye on Stevie.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.116
Hey, you!
Stop!

15:34.434 --> 15:37.097
- Please don't hurt me!
- What are you doing here?

15:37.228 --> 15:38.685
You up here looking for
boy-whores?

15:38.813 --> 15:39.974
Is that what you're doing?!

15:40.106 --> 15:42.814
I'm doing God's work,
counseling the poor!

15:42.942 --> 15:44.478
Please don't hurt me!

15:46.946 --> 15:48.653
God's work.

15:50.241 --> 15:53.484
Please.
God's work.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.785
God's work.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.671
Perhaps I'm mistaken
about the calendar.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.673
Laszlo, there could be
any number of reasons

16:16.809 --> 16:18.971
why nothing happened tonight.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.810
Maybe the Feast of Ascension

16:20.938 --> 16:23.180
holds no particular meaning
for him.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.059
Or perhaps by closing
the brothels, we scared him off.

16:26.194 --> 16:30.734
Or I could simply be wrong...
wrong about all of it.

16:37.455 --> 16:41.950
Maybe the killer <i>was</i> here
and you just didn't know it.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.542
Seventeen men talked to Stevie
tonight.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.081
Might have been any one of them.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.709
Stevie, of all the men
you spoke with tonight,

16:51.844 --> 16:53.084
was there not one who evidenced

16:53.179 --> 16:55.136
something unusual
about his appearance?

16:55.264 --> 16:56.846
No one with a silver smile?

16:58.059 --> 17:01.427
What if Van Bergen didn't appear
because he's not the killer?

17:06.358 --> 17:08.099
So what do we do now?

17:08.236 --> 17:10.193
We wait for the next holy day.

17:11.906 --> 17:12.987
When's that?

17:13.115 --> 17:16.699
Nine days from now.
Pentecost.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.107
Good to see you.
Good to see you, Mr. Morgan.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.664
And for youse two?

18:46.792 --> 18:48.499
A lemonade, please.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.961
- Yes, ma'am.
- I'll have the same.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.132
I'm proud of you, John.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.296
Well, you know what they say,
Gran.

18:57.428 --> 18:59.511
Abstinence makes the heart
grow fonder.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.639
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.427
Tell me...

19:07.563 --> 19:11.682
Do you think bidding at auction
allows for the same titillation

19:11.817 --> 19:14.776
as games of chance?

19:14.904 --> 19:16.440
Only for the losers.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.359
What do you mean?

19:18.491 --> 19:21.529
Well, for some,
the pleasure is in the pain.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.153
Where ever did you hear
such a thing?

19:24.288 --> 19:26.655
I read it in a book.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.395
What happened to your finger,
Mary?

19:52.858 --> 19:54.941
May I see?

20:03.202 --> 20:04.864
Oh.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.703
You've cut yourself.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.709
It doesn't look too deep,
but it's still bleeding.

20:21.095 --> 20:24.679
Saliva contains
a natural coagulant.

20:24.807 --> 20:28.551
That means it clots the blood
and allows for hemostasis.

20:28.686 --> 20:31.224
It's why animals lick
their wounds.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.734
The bleeding should stop now.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.090
May we have a photograph?

21:08.684 --> 21:10.141
Certainly, young lady.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.306
Uh, just there.
We'll get the city behind you.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.395
That'll be a first.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.059
Oh.
You too, Mr. Moore.

21:16.192 --> 21:17.774
Oh, no, no.
I don't, uh...

21:17.902 --> 21:19.518
Nonsense.

21:19.653 --> 21:22.191
Oh, all right.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.616
Hold quiet now.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.235
Is your grandmother here, John?

21:28.370 --> 21:31.408
Oh, yes. She wouldn't miss this
for love nor money.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.997
Wonderful. I have it.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.583
Why don't you and I take one
together, Theodore?

21:35.711 --> 21:37.498
Just the two of us.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.418
Alice, why don't we take
Mr. Moore and show him around?

21:40.549 --> 21:41.835
Mm.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.472
Look to me now, Mr. Morgan,
Mr. Roosevelt.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.891
I've had a talk with
our old friend Bishop Potter.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.681
It seems your alienist came by,

21:53.813 --> 21:56.305
inquiring about a member
of the church.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.858
What member might that be?

21:59.985 --> 22:01.021
The one whose family

22:01.153 --> 22:03.145
helped get our dear friend
the mayor elected.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.522
The very same man who appointed
you president

22:05.658 --> 22:07.365
of the Board
of Police Commissioners.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.155
And look to me.

22:12.206 --> 22:13.913
Wonderful.
I have it.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.907
Take another one.

22:18.504 --> 22:21.713
Dr. Kreizler is conducting
an investigation at my request.

22:21.841 --> 22:25.676
How he goes about it and to whom
he speaks I leave to him.

22:26.220 --> 22:29.133
I've been assured
that the young man in question,

22:29.265 --> 22:32.758
whom you attempted to arrest,
will soon be leaving the country

22:32.893 --> 22:34.805
and therefore no longer poses
a threat

22:34.937 --> 22:37.475
to the children of this city.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.973
What about the children
of other cities?

22:40.109 --> 22:41.691
Gentlemen.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.942
Do not betray your own kind,
Roosevelt,

22:50.077 --> 22:55.163
or you'll find yourself
with no job, no friends,

22:55.291 --> 22:57.533
and no goddamn future.

23:09.013 --> 23:10.254
Dr. Kreizler?

23:12.141 --> 23:13.677
Ah.
Miss Howard.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.300
Hello, Cyrus.

23:15.436 --> 23:16.722
Excuse me for letting myself in,

23:16.854 --> 23:19.597
but, Doctor, I've come
to tell you about my plan.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.630
Given that our killer
seems to prefer

23:21.734 --> 23:23.396
taking boys
from inside their room,

23:23.527 --> 23:26.110
I've arranged to have Stevie
stationed inside the brothel.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.675
I've convinced the commissioner
to help,

23:29.783 --> 23:31.303
although he'll not want it
acknowledged.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.284
I'm afraid that wherever Stevie
is placed

23:33.412 --> 23:36.075
may do nothing to help us find
our killer.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.036
What about
the Christian calendar?

23:39.168 --> 23:40.608
Just because it didn't work
last time

23:40.711 --> 23:42.031
doesn't mean it won't work
at all.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.170
Now that the killer has given in
to his desires,

23:44.298 --> 23:45.960
he can't easily stop himself.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.957
Isn't that your theory?

23:50.095 --> 23:53.304
I sometimes wonder
what good my theories do.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.594
For the moment, they only occupy
the bookshelves

23:55.726 --> 23:57.092
of other alienists.

23:57.227 --> 24:00.095
As I said, it's been arranged.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.311
For tomorrow.

24:03.359 --> 24:04.600
Yes.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.194
Pentecost.

24:13.953 --> 24:17.412
Oh, I'm curious as to where
you'll put him, Gran.

24:17.539 --> 24:20.703
I shall keep him in the parlor.

24:20.834 --> 24:23.121
That way, I'll have someone
to talk to

24:23.253 --> 24:25.370
when you're out carousing.

24:25.506 --> 24:26.506
Hello, Mrs. Moore.

24:26.590 --> 24:27.797
Hello, Sara.

24:27.925 --> 24:30.008
That's a fine armadillo
you have.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.878
Thank you.

24:33.013 --> 24:36.882
Did you see what my grandson
spent his money on?

24:37.017 --> 24:39.805
I spent it on the orphans, Gran.

24:40.854 --> 24:44.018
I've hoisted anchors
that weigh less.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.186
A typewriter?

24:46.318 --> 24:48.605
I was hoping you might teach me
how to use it.

24:48.737 --> 24:49.737
You?

24:50.155 --> 24:52.488
I once had aspirations
of being a writer.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.824
I thought I might have
another crack at it.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.485
I don't think that's possible.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.700
Oh, you think I lack talent?

24:59.832 --> 25:04.122
I think you lack dexterity...
in your fingers, that is.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.411
All men do.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.413
It's why they'll never be
any good at it.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.010
Kreizler!

25:20.686 --> 25:21.520
There you are.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.263
I'm afraid you will have to wait
your turn.

25:26.191 --> 25:30.026
I'm here to let you know
your actions...

25:30.154 --> 25:33.067
have become conspicuous
to some very important people.

25:34.199 --> 25:37.283
I'm sorry if they're casting
a shadow over your good name.

25:37.411 --> 25:40.825
Don't worry about my good name.
I know who my enemies are.

25:40.956 --> 25:44.415
I've been informed Willem Van
Bergen is leaving the country.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.205
Mm.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.252
Do you not believe it?

25:48.380 --> 25:50.497
I told you...

25:50.632 --> 25:53.750
I do not believe he's the man
we're looking for.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.422
You plan on another stakeout?

25:55.554 --> 25:56.635
With Pentecost tomorrow,

25:56.764 --> 25:59.598
I believe our killer
will be compelled to act.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.261
He won't be able to stop
himself.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.759
We must therefore take advantage

26:02.895 --> 26:05.262
of every opportunity offered
to us.

26:13.739 --> 26:17.073
What causes a man to do
such things?

26:18.243 --> 26:22.783
Are we to consider him...
mentally defective?

26:23.624 --> 26:26.617
A lunatic acting irrationally?

26:26.752 --> 26:30.245
Or is it possible he's as sane
as you and I

26:30.380 --> 26:34.750
and there indeed is...
method to his madness?

26:36.595 --> 26:39.554
Those who are seen dancing
are thought insane

26:39.681 --> 26:41.593
by those who cannot hear
the music.

26:45.479 --> 26:48.768
It's just a matter of finding
a way to hear the music.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.938
Sara, would you like something
to drink?

26:53.070 --> 26:54.481
I'll have a whiskey.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.105
No, thank you, Mrs. Moore.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.777
Why did she look at you
like that?

27:02.329 --> 27:04.537
I quit drinking.

27:04.665 --> 27:07.999
I have the shakes to prove it.
See?

27:09.920 --> 27:11.377
Bravo, John.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.631
Now I have something
to show you.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.842
I was thinking about my father,

27:18.971 --> 27:21.884
which got me to thinking about
Kreizler's theory about fathers,

27:22.015 --> 27:24.428
which got me to thinking about
Kreizler's own father.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.472
That's a lot of thinking.

27:26.603 --> 27:29.061
Look at this.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.652
Oh, it's an old society column.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.863
I didn't know what
I was looking for at first,

27:38.991 --> 27:41.074
but when I saw this,
it struck me.

27:41.201 --> 27:44.444
You were looking for something
on Kreizler's father?

27:44.580 --> 27:45.821
About Kreizler.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.745
You seem to be obsessed
with the man.

27:49.877 --> 27:51.493
Perhaps you're in love with him.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.545
- Perhaps I am.
- Mm.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.005
Go on.
Read it.

27:58.468 --> 28:01.256
"Mr. and Mrs. Kreizler
of Fifth Avenue,

28:01.388 --> 28:04.881
recent émigrés to the city
from Germany."

28:05.517 --> 28:08.225
It's just a newspaper clipping
from 30 years ago.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.515
Skip down
to the second-to-last paragraph.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.482
"The evening was highlighted
by young Master Kreizler,

28:14.610 --> 28:16.727
who dazzled all
with his interpretation

28:16.862 --> 28:19.946
of Mozart's 'Concerto for Piano
No. 20 in D minor."'

28:20.532 --> 28:22.819
I fail to see anything
unsettling

28:22.951 --> 28:24.283
about a piano recital.

28:24.411 --> 28:27.779
Unless it's Mozart's "Concerto
for Piano No. 20 in D minor."

28:28.874 --> 28:29.874
What of it?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.617
It cannot be played
with one hand.

28:38.508 --> 28:43.219
He said his arm was malformed,
a congenital defect.

28:46.016 --> 28:49.134
Yes. That's how he's always
described it.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.478
Then he was always lying.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.732
You want to take me upstairs?

30:23.488 --> 30:25.480
Whoa!

30:31.079 --> 30:33.412
Thank you.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.840
Connor.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.262
Van Bergen's just got on
the water taxi.

30:53.852 --> 30:54.888
To where?

30:55.020 --> 30:57.353
Well, it's not going
to Buenos Aires.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.855
I'm going out for a while!

30:59.983 --> 31:01.315
He's going to Buenos Aires

31:01.443 --> 31:03.935
if we've got to take him there
ourselves.

31:12.412 --> 31:13.823
You're doing it all wrong.

31:13.955 --> 31:14.991
What?

31:15.123 --> 31:17.331
You have to use your eyes.

31:17.459 --> 31:18.459
My eyes?

31:18.460 --> 31:22.454
You know, bat your lashes.
Draw them in.

31:26.927 --> 31:30.170
No.
Like this.

31:40.232 --> 31:43.396
You make an awful girl.

32:28.196 --> 32:30.188
Going somewhere, son?

32:50.343 --> 32:53.086
Running, huh?

32:53.221 --> 32:54.837
Come back!

33:03.440 --> 33:05.147
Come after him, Doyle!

33:26.922 --> 33:28.914
Who are you?

33:29.049 --> 33:30.381
I have money.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.333
Take this.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.511
You're a degenerate.

33:37.641 --> 33:43.353
A filthy... murdering pederast.

33:45.106 --> 33:47.473
You have no right
to live among decent people.

33:47.609 --> 33:49.692
I'm a Van Bergen!

33:49.819 --> 33:51.276
We're part of the Four Hundred.

33:51.404 --> 33:52.940
Four Hundred, my arse.

33:53.073 --> 33:55.486
You're nothing
but a rich little pansy.

33:55.617 --> 33:56.903
Dirty sodomite!

33:57.035 --> 33:58.901
You cannot talk to me like that!

33:59.037 --> 34:00.869
I'm a Van Bergen!

34:01.498 --> 34:03.364
You cannot touch me!

34:06.586 --> 34:08.578
Easy now, Connor.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.382
You won't do that.

34:14.010 --> 34:16.252
You can't do that.

34:18.348 --> 34:20.214
Dirty sodomite.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.478
You'll pay for this!

34:26.773 --> 34:27.980
You'll hang!

34:34.822 --> 34:37.485
Holy Mother of God.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.746
To hell with him!

34:58.722 --> 35:00.384
That'll do.

36:35.151 --> 36:37.438
Do you really think
we can catch this man?

36:41.366 --> 36:45.406
Multi-murderers rarely get away
with their crimes for long.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.199
What about Jack the Ripper?

36:49.582 --> 36:53.417
There are exceptions...
of course.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.218
Hello.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.057
Joseph.

37:09.185 --> 37:10.642
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

37:10.770 --> 37:13.387
It's just too hot working in
the room with the window closed.

37:13.523 --> 37:14.855
Oh.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.945
Does he really work
for the police?

37:38.006 --> 37:40.248
Buy us a bottle of champagne?

37:41.426 --> 37:42.792
How old are you?

37:43.887 --> 37:46.095
How old would you like?

37:52.353 --> 37:53.935
Hello.

37:59.235 --> 38:02.945
I'm happy to see you're not
still out on the street.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.023
What's your name?

38:05.158 --> 38:08.196
Rosie.
Take me upstairs.

38:10.205 --> 38:12.538
How about some poetry instead,
Rosie?

38:12.665 --> 38:14.031
Poetry?

38:17.045 --> 38:19.788
Wouldn't you like
to get away from all this?

38:21.508 --> 38:23.340
I can help you.

38:24.093 --> 38:25.755
How do you mean?

38:26.805 --> 38:32.426
A pansy by way of Khartoum
took a lesbian up to his room.

38:33.186 --> 38:35.269
They argued all night
as to who had the right

38:35.396 --> 38:36.853
to do what with which
and to whom.

38:38.650 --> 38:39.857
Tell another.

38:41.903 --> 38:44.486
I can take you away...

38:45.490 --> 38:47.322
...to a castle.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.572
We can go there together.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.957
If all you got to do is
draw pictures to make money,

39:04.092 --> 39:06.459
why doesn't everybody do it?

39:06.594 --> 39:08.426
Because not everybody has
the talent.

39:10.890 --> 39:12.426
Find a room upstairs.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.551
Wait for me there.

39:22.151 --> 39:24.393
Joseph... do not leave this room.

39:24.529 --> 39:25.529
Stay here!

39:27.365 --> 39:29.277
It was him.
It was him.

39:29.409 --> 39:30.775
Stop him!

39:43.256 --> 39:45.464
Stop! Police!

39:56.811 --> 39:57.972
I'm sorry.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.312
Do you play?

40:08.448 --> 40:11.566
When I was younger.
Do you know the piece?

40:12.243 --> 40:13.950
Yes.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.499
I was told you were once
something of a prodigy.

40:27.634 --> 40:30.047
I suppose I had my moment
in the sun.

40:31.054 --> 40:34.013
He'll be looking for you.
Keep the curtains opened.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.469
Put the chair against the door.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.106
What's Stevie doing
in that room?

40:48.237 --> 40:50.775
Something's wrong.
Stay here!

40:56.663 --> 40:58.871
What happened to your arm,
Doctor?

40:58.998 --> 41:00.534
That is no concern of yours.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.061
Why do you feel it necessary
to lie...

41:02.085 --> 41:04.828
Stop. I will not have you talk
to me that way.

41:14.555 --> 41:15.555
Whatever it is,

41:15.556 --> 41:19.049
it's what accounts for your bias
against the killer.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.426
Who did this to you, Doctor?

41:20.561 --> 41:22.723
I see no need to discuss
my private life with you.

41:34.242 --> 41:36.242
Why can't you do what
you yourself demand of others

41:36.327 --> 41:37.989
and be honest?

41:38.955 --> 41:40.662
You don't have the courage
to see yourself

41:40.790 --> 41:43.328
for who you really are
because you're a coward.

41:51.426 --> 41:54.043
Laszlo!
Laszlo!

41:54.178 --> 41:55.419
Hurry!

42:17.702 --> 42:20.661
Hey. It's okay.
It's me.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.654
Stevie!
Where is he?

42:22.790 --> 42:24.076
He got away.

42:24.208 --> 42:25.949
Perhaps the others saw him.

42:26.085 --> 42:27.542
What's going on?

42:29.922 --> 42:30.922
Cyrus.

42:33.843 --> 42:36.460
Miss Howard,
please stay with Stevie.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.233
Cyrus?

43:08.878 --> 43:10.369
Cyrus!

43:11.714 --> 43:12.714
Cyrus.

43:12.799 --> 43:14.256
We have to get him
medical attention.

43:14.383 --> 43:15.840
Go and find a roundsman.

43:17.095 --> 43:18.211
Wait.

43:18.346 --> 43:21.885
Why would the man attack Cyrus
and draw attention to himself?

43:22.016 --> 43:23.928
It makes no sense.

43:26.062 --> 43:27.724
Unless...
