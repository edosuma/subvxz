00:06.131 --> 00:08.466
THIS SERIES IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

00:08.550 --> 00:11.886
BUT CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
HAVE BEEN REIMAGINED FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES

00:15.557 --> 00:16.850
How's my offer?

00:17.392 --> 00:18.852
Enticing, right?

00:20.311 --> 00:21.271
Offer?

00:23.314 --> 00:27.485
You need my meth network in Europe
to sell your coke in a month.

00:28.903 --> 00:29.779
It makes sense.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.365
And it should be possible.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.284
I'll give you a fair cut.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.577
Take the deal.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.871
If you don't sell your coke,

00:39.039 --> 00:40.623
Cali Cartel will kill you.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.127
I'd rather watch you die.

00:45.545 --> 00:46.838
Why should I help you?

00:46.921 --> 00:49.174
Seven million in three weeks.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.468
Is that a good reason?

00:51.551 --> 00:57.057
With you dead, I could control
the cocaine business in Suriname.

00:59.809 --> 01:01.478
What are you trying to say?

01:05.648 --> 01:09.027
I wanna keep selling cocaine
after this deal.

01:10.862 --> 01:14.282
We don't trust each other enough
to have that conversation now.

01:14.365 --> 01:17.869
After this deal, we can talk again.

01:17.952 --> 01:18.870
Got it?

01:23.917 --> 01:24.751
No.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.588
I'm gonna love watching you die.

01:39.516 --> 01:45.063
You think the Colombians will suddenly
hand over their product once I'm dead?

01:45.647 --> 01:48.942
And will Suriname's president support you?

01:52.070 --> 01:53.029
Chen Zhen.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.491
In the name of the Lord,

01:59.077 --> 02:00.995
I promise you one thing.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.832
Whether I live or die,

02:05.208 --> 02:07.001
you will never touch

02:08.128 --> 02:09.921
a gram of cocaine.

02:10.004 --> 02:11.005
Got that?

02:12.298 --> 02:13.133
So,

02:14.092 --> 02:16.719
take the deal, accept all my terms,

02:16.803 --> 02:20.348
or go back to selling fucking meth.

02:24.435 --> 02:26.604
What is he plotting?

02:27.105 --> 02:28.314
Damn it.

02:33.653 --> 02:34.737
Okay.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.448
I will help you this time.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.035
But like you said,

02:42.495 --> 02:44.914
there's not much trust between us.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.251
Not only that,

02:48.835 --> 02:52.380
there's a traitor in your family
who switched sides.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.716
If you kill him,

02:54.799 --> 02:56.843
you will have my trust.

02:58.219 --> 02:59.345
Or…

03:00.138 --> 03:01.681
give Byun to us.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.475
Then I will sell your coke for you.

03:12.108 --> 03:16.112
You conniving fuck. You want the preacher.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.159
Yes or no?

03:25.288 --> 03:26.497
Chen Zhen assured us

03:26.581 --> 03:29.334
that if we use
his Chinatown meth routing network,

03:29.417 --> 03:31.920
we can sell 1.5 tons of coke
in three weeks.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.380
That's a lot better than I imagined.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.883
What do you think, Byun?
Those numbers sound right?

03:36.966 --> 03:40.637
Given the reach of Chinatowns
all over Europe and other places,

03:41.137 --> 03:42.513
it's doable, sir.

03:56.736 --> 03:57.862
I'm not sure.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.200
Now that I know
what kind of volume you can move,

04:02.283 --> 04:03.993
I think this
could strengthen that asshole.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.828
Never.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.456
This batch could be one of many
you unload with Chen,

04:08.539 --> 04:09.874
or stop collaborating.

04:10.541 --> 04:12.168
The option's up to you.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.339
Hmm.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.008
Okay. David says yes.

04:19.550 --> 04:22.512
We take a chance on these guys
and see how it goes.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.473
I'd like to hear
what you gentleman think of this.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.393
Will you be comfortable
working with a known heathen

04:28.476 --> 04:29.978
who worships evil spirits?

04:30.061 --> 04:33.606
Puerto Rico's another option
if you can't trust that scumbag.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.402
If I'm being completely honest,

04:37.485 --> 04:40.071
there's a lot of bad blood
between me and Chen Zhen.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.365
I'd rather not deal with that viper.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.158
But the stakes are high here.

04:44.242 --> 04:47.287
I wouldn't want to miss an opportunity
because of my past.

04:47.370 --> 04:51.457
If this makes the sale go through,
of course, I support you, Pastor.

04:51.541 --> 04:52.959
Mm-hmm.

04:54.877 --> 04:57.714
I think I need to go into this
a bit deeper with David.

04:59.173 --> 05:01.342
Excuse us while we continue in private?

05:05.596 --> 05:06.597
Of course, sir.

05:16.065 --> 05:16.941
Pastor.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.571
If we move our product
successfully through this mess,

05:21.654 --> 05:23.740
it will cement your cocaine kingdom

05:23.823 --> 05:26.117
just like you imagined it.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.077
Once this deal goes through,

05:28.161 --> 05:31.456
you'll be in a position
to eliminate any annoyance you please.

05:38.713 --> 05:41.883
I only came to the casino
to get a hold of Chen Zhen.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.470
He doesn't pick up my calls.
Something's up, I think.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.305
Speaking of which,

05:48.389 --> 05:50.058
if Jeon and Chen Zhen actually do team up,

05:50.141 --> 05:53.019
<i>I assume this entire operation</i>
<i>will go down the drain?</i>

05:53.603 --> 05:55.688
That would be a worst-case scenario.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.316
If it derails like that,
go to the US Embassy.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.693
But if I drop off the radar
when crap hits the fan,

06:00.777 --> 06:02.528
that'll make me
suspect number one for Jeon.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.197
He'll come after me for sure.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.990
Then my family will be in danger.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.701
He could send people to Korea
after my wife and kids.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.413
And there's another big issue.

06:13.748 --> 06:14.665
Hey, my friend.

06:19.253 --> 06:20.421
If I go home like this,

06:20.505 --> 06:23.049
I'll resent the loss so bad,
I won't be able to sleep at night.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.927
Do me one last favor
to salvage this, Ingu.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.179
Get Jeon to reconsider Puerto Rico.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.056
He and Chen are rivals,

06:30.139 --> 06:32.850
and you can bet the last thing Jeon wants
is to be in his debt.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.895
Okay. You sound pretty sure.

06:37.271 --> 06:39.315
Oh, you're gonna
have to trust me on this, Ingu.

06:41.025 --> 06:43.861
Sounds familiar.
I'm in no position to refuse.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.239
What's the plan
if Jeon says no to my suggestion?

06:46.322 --> 06:47.490
Do I keep pushing?

06:48.741 --> 06:51.452
Just trust your gut
and do what you think is right.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.287
Good agents know how to read the play.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.418
All right, Sangman. I'll put my trust
in what you're saying one last time.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.502
Bye.

07:05.675 --> 07:06.509
Hey, tough guy.

07:13.641 --> 07:15.435
This is for our friendship.

07:16.644 --> 07:17.562
Take it.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.152
Call me when you find your boss.

09:10.299 --> 09:12.134
The gentle breeze
and moonlight on the water

09:12.218 --> 09:13.594
is very friendly company.

09:13.678 --> 09:14.720
Life is good.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.180
You should join us.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.640
Get your blood flowing.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.433
What I want to flow

09:19.517 --> 09:22.311
is your cocaine
out of here and into Korea.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.938
And cash into my account.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.776
Gotta love your focus.

09:28.859 --> 09:31.571
Am I the only one worried
about the schedule?

09:31.654 --> 09:33.990
You have to decide about Puerto Rico now.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.003
Brother Kang.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.546
You do know

09:49.255 --> 09:50.881
who Pablo Escobar was, don't you?

09:51.716 --> 09:53.551
Mm-mm. Pablo?

09:54.677 --> 09:55.595
Friend of yours?

09:55.678 --> 09:58.889
Escobar was the most powerful cartel boss
in the world.

09:59.473 --> 10:02.476
The guy made so much money
he earned more than General Motors.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.770
He was rich, respected, and ruthless.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.315
He owned most of Colombians
some way or other,

10:07.398 --> 10:08.941
including his politicians.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.360
The man might as well have been a king.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.281
And in spite of all that…

10:15.990 --> 10:17.199
you know how he died?

10:17.283 --> 10:20.620
Shot dead in the street like a dog.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.705
Chased by the DEA from the US,

10:22.788 --> 10:24.540
who flushed him out of his hideout.

10:25.499 --> 10:26.542
The point is…

10:28.419 --> 10:30.796
The Americans cast a wide net.

10:31.797 --> 10:35.968
Which is why
I gave President Delano my word

10:36.052 --> 10:39.305
that under no circumstances
would I send coke to the United States.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.848
I understand that, Pastor,

10:40.931 --> 10:43.309
but you wouldn't be sending coke
to America.

10:43.392 --> 10:44.560
It's a pass-through.

10:44.644 --> 10:48.272
Anyway, Puerto Rico doesn't count.
It's not part of the US.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.191
Technically, it's not.

10:50.941 --> 10:53.653
But you have to remember
the Cali Cartel's my supplier,

10:53.736 --> 10:55.988
and they wouldn't appreciate
my sending their coke on boats

10:56.072 --> 10:57.323
transiting through their turf.

10:57.406 --> 11:00.201
All of North America
belongs to the Colombians.

11:02.244 --> 11:06.290
There are deadly angles to consider here.
You need to be patient.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.503
Goo and I discussed
all the angles earlier.

11:17.593 --> 11:18.636
He said…

11:18.719 --> 11:22.264
Puerto Rico is the only option
to get coke from Suriname to Korea.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.394
Anyway, why should we
have to throw out our only option?

11:26.894 --> 11:28.396
Because Cali won't like it

11:28.479 --> 11:30.648
when we're not selling anything
in their territory?

11:35.778 --> 11:38.489
Do you put your hand in the fire
to see if it's hot?

11:39.031 --> 11:39.865
Huh?

11:41.075 --> 11:42.576
I don't appreciate you doubting me.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.589
If you keep refusing the suggestions
my partner and I bring to you,

11:55.673 --> 11:57.717
I'll have to rethink
what we're doing here.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.634
I can't wait around.

12:02.930 --> 12:05.683
You gave me the impression
you were wise.

12:05.766 --> 12:09.061
Why do insist on pushing my buttons?
Do you have a death wish?

12:10.146 --> 12:13.649
I have to push because you won't jump,
chicken shit bastard.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.653
What did you just call me?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.864
Spawn of the devil!

12:19.947 --> 12:22.241
Demon motherfucker!

12:27.413 --> 12:30.249
Show some respect!

12:36.839 --> 12:39.759
Demons should be done away with.
Don't you think?

12:41.051 --> 12:42.928
I know you're living on credit.

12:44.346 --> 12:47.475
If you kill me, you lose every penny.
Go ahead, Jeon.

12:48.726 --> 12:49.935
Kill me!

12:50.936 --> 12:52.938
You and I'd rather stop living

12:53.022 --> 12:55.107
then go back to surviving, right?

12:55.191 --> 12:56.859
So take me home now, asshole,

12:56.942 --> 12:58.527
and throw your life away.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.987
If you have the guts!

13:06.702 --> 13:09.830
No doubt Lucifer
has commandeered your soul, brother.

13:11.874 --> 13:15.419
It often happens when the spirit is weak,
and you lose faith.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.138
Go get some rest.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.682
The body must be healthy

13:30.184 --> 13:31.685
for the soul to thrive.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.611
Wait.

13:49.954 --> 13:50.996
Take him away!

13:55.501 --> 13:57.878
This is fucking unbelievable!

13:58.420 --> 14:01.090
Enjoy your last dregs
of happiness, asshole!

14:01.173 --> 14:04.093
Your bullshit kingdom is about to crumble!

14:27.616 --> 14:28.450
Okay.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.036
Let me see. Let me see.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.705
CASINO SECURITY

14:37.376 --> 14:40.379
SANGMAN, TALKING TO THE PASTOR
IS LIKE PULLING TEETH.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.464
I'LL DO THINGS MY WAY.

14:44.925 --> 14:45.759
Stay.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.720
Go away.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.728
I wanna go to the hospital,
not to your boss.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.022
I fucking need stitches!

15:24.590 --> 15:27.718
SANGMAN

15:28.928 --> 15:29.762
DECLINE

15:43.817 --> 15:44.860
Come in.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.667
You would really work with Pastor Jeon?

15:59.750 --> 16:01.001
Just to take down Byun?

16:01.085 --> 16:02.711
What are you talking about?

16:03.212 --> 16:04.463
I don't know what you mean.

16:04.546 --> 16:05.547
Bullshit.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.884
I heard it from Jeon's right-hand man.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.521
Even so,

16:21.271 --> 16:23.440
Jeon would never kill his loyal servant.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.609
He sells everything for money.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.695
He sells God.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.238
Selling Byun is easy.

16:30.030 --> 16:30.864
Yeah?

16:32.324 --> 16:34.159
Byun is a problem for us.

16:34.743 --> 16:36.787
He knows my family's weaknesses.

16:36.870 --> 16:42.001
But if he's eliminated
and we get some profit out of it,

16:42.960 --> 16:45.462
it's not a bad deal. Hmm?

16:54.221 --> 16:56.265
You have 100 soldiers, right?

16:57.516 --> 16:59.476
You want to count the spoons in my drawer?

17:03.397 --> 17:06.483
I worry you'll lose 100 heads for one man.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.444
Oh, sorry.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.904
One hundred one heads, with your head.

17:18.579 --> 17:22.583
You're gonna tell me that Pastor Jeon
will try to kill me after this?

17:23.333 --> 17:25.335
So I should stop dealing with him?

17:26.587 --> 17:27.796
You say that

17:28.338 --> 17:32.384
because you lose all the money
if he uses my route.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.890
You're right,

17:39.266 --> 17:41.518
but you forget one thing.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.855
Why would Jeon need your meth route
in the future?

17:45.397 --> 17:47.566
If you sell his coke this time,

17:47.649 --> 17:49.193
he doesn't need you and me.

17:51.278 --> 17:54.573
He'll be even bigger
than the Colombia Cali Cartel. Hmm?

18:03.290 --> 18:05.084
Ah, so hot.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.544
Let's go cool off.

18:21.850 --> 18:22.768
Look at this.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.734
So the rumors are true, huh?

18:31.401 --> 18:32.653
Where is this place?

18:32.736 --> 18:34.196
Not knowing is better.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.074
You get close, his guys will shoot you.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.576
That's why there are only rumors about it.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.829
Outside people never see this place.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.083
You sell his coke,
he can finish his kingdom.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.835
Then he doesn't need us.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.170
Because he can make
huge money in his kingdom.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.421
And we're done!

18:55.050 --> 18:56.593
Those are just photos.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.887
I can't even tell
where they're taken from.

18:58.971 --> 18:59.805
Okay.

19:00.597 --> 19:01.598
You choose.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.268
Sell Pastor's coke and die.

19:04.852 --> 19:08.105
Or kill him and take this kingdom with me.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.160
Yeah.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.328
You just don't get it, right?

19:23.412 --> 19:24.538
Let's say we kill Jeon.

19:24.621 --> 19:28.000
What happens with the president
and the Cali Cartel?

19:30.335 --> 19:32.838
You think they'll help us?

19:34.214 --> 19:35.883
I don't think so.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.010
Chen Zhen.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.933
I got this watch from Delano
as a token of friendship.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.143
I can talk to him.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.229
<i>Colombia is the same!</i>

19:49.313 --> 19:51.607
<i>The world talks in one language.</i>

19:53.233 --> 19:56.570
Anyway, people believe
each other with this.

19:56.653 --> 20:00.240
The president and the Colombians
can bond over dollar bills.

20:03.118 --> 20:03.952
Now.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.081
Let's kill Jeon.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.209
We can work together
with the original plan.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.543
Boss.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.299
I got a call from David.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.926
They are handing over Byun.

20:20.427 --> 20:23.263
Did David say they'll give you Byun?

20:23.764 --> 20:25.933
Hmm? Did you make a deal with Jeon?

20:28.101 --> 20:29.269
Just bet on me.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.022
I'll make you the bigger man.

20:32.105 --> 20:32.940
Brother,

20:33.023 --> 20:34.691
remember my words.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.360
Fight for money.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.819
It's time to fight.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.290
This is Chen Zhen.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.501
You will give me Byun?

20:52.584 --> 20:54.628
Yes, we'll hand him over.

20:54.711 --> 20:57.589
Whether you kill him or not,
that's up to you.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.300
<i>I'm glad to hear that.</i>

21:01.009 --> 21:04.054
We'll give you the time and the place
for the handoff soon.

21:10.060 --> 21:14.314
Chen Zhen's got something up his sleeve.
I can tell. He's acting too fucking clean.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.149
Something doesn't feel right.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.910
Let's double-up on the vigilance.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.288
Demons are after us, David.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.414
Yes, sir.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.712
<i>Brother, remember my words.</i>

21:37.754 --> 21:38.839
<i>Fight for money.</i>

21:38.922 --> 21:40.424
<i>It's time to fight.</i>

21:49.182 --> 21:50.684
Excuse me, sir.

21:50.767 --> 21:53.103
If you mention this conversation to him,

21:53.186 --> 21:55.814
he's going to realize
we're using his phone for surveillance.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.733
You know that, right?

22:01.737 --> 22:04.781
Wait, are you telling me
you told your people to tap into my phone?

22:05.615 --> 22:07.743
What do you mean
what are Chen and I up to?

22:07.826 --> 22:10.120
Isn't the purpose of your department
to gather information?

22:10.203 --> 22:11.621
Have your people figure it out.

22:11.705 --> 22:14.916
Ingu, if you act like a loose cannon,
we're not gonna be able to keep going.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.251
You know what?

22:16.335 --> 22:18.211
I don't care
if the operation keeps going or not.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.755
I'm just trying not to get killed.

22:19.838 --> 22:23.008
The worst thing that can happen is
for Jeon and Chen Zhen to work together.

22:23.091 --> 22:24.384
I'll be expendable!

22:25.927 --> 22:27.471
You told me to trust my instincts.

22:27.554 --> 22:30.015
I need you to back me up on this
because I know these assholes.

22:33.852 --> 22:34.686
All right.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.022
How do you want us to help you?

22:37.522 --> 22:40.067
I need to know Jeon's location
and movements.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.276
Is that doable?

22:56.291 --> 22:57.959
<i> Jeon is on the move right now.</i>

22:58.543 --> 23:00.295
You're gonna have to adjust
your expectations.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.423
Things won't go down the way you wanted.
I'm in survival mode.

23:03.507 --> 23:06.134
I'm only doing this
to save my own ass, not yours.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.345
Whatever your gut tells you
is the right move.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.764
I sure hope it works in your favor.

23:20.690 --> 23:22.776
Our focus right now
is tracking Jeon's movements.

23:22.859 --> 23:26.571
Put in the call to the US Embassy
and ask them to be on standby.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.916
EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES, PARAMARIBO

23:52.639 --> 23:53.682
They're on the move.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.642
<i>Take them out, or we die.</i>

23:56.643 --> 23:58.562
Quickly, get in!

24:25.797 --> 24:29.384
Three green vans just left.
They all went through the main entrance.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.760
Nothing else to report.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.596
Good work, Preacher.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.639
Stay focused and the lookout
for anything unusual.

24:34.723 --> 24:35.974
Take care, bro.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.937
Call Chen Zhen now. Tell him we're ready.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.105
Yes, sir.

24:46.067 --> 24:48.695
We're ready for the handoff. Stand by.

24:48.778 --> 24:53.074
And Byun is… on the roof of 89 Kalpoeweg.

25:08.715 --> 25:09.966
The area's clear, sir.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.683
I think it's best
if we move the product first.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.023
Come on.

26:26.042 --> 26:27.294
CHEN ZHEN

26:32.257 --> 26:33.592
SENDING

26:53.236 --> 26:54.195
Move! Hurry up!

26:54.279 --> 26:56.281
Fuckers are coming for us!

26:58.283 --> 26:59.117
Shit!

27:05.582 --> 27:07.125
Go up!

27:09.753 --> 27:10.837
Shit!

27:10.920 --> 27:11.963
Hurry!

27:33.526 --> 27:35.028
<i>I got Byun.</i>

27:35.111 --> 27:36.696
<i>Now give us the coke.</i>

27:37.656 --> 27:40.659
I'll tell you where it is when we leave.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.827
<i>You look pretty busy.</i>

27:43.536 --> 27:45.538
<i>Just hand it over, chief.</i>

28:09.813 --> 28:12.273
You love your fucking god, don't you?

28:12.857 --> 28:13.983
Go see him today.

28:23.451 --> 28:25.161
You son of a bitch!

29:01.573 --> 29:03.950
Ah!

29:08.455 --> 29:09.873
Get up!

29:10.582 --> 29:11.416
Fuck!

29:23.094 --> 29:24.804
Ah!

29:42.947 --> 29:44.365
Follow me, Pastor!

29:55.293 --> 29:56.169
Fuck!

29:56.795 --> 29:58.171
Go! Go!

29:58.254 --> 30:00.965
Chase him! Quickly!

30:35.583 --> 30:36.709
Ah!

31:11.119 --> 31:13.329
Oh shit, they fucking ran away?

31:13.413 --> 31:15.123
Get the coke! Get the coke!

31:15.206 --> 31:17.292
We don't have time. We have to hurry!

31:17.959 --> 31:19.794
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

31:21.087 --> 31:23.256
Let's go, Pastor, let's go!
Come on, come on!

31:23.339 --> 31:24.924
We've gotta go! Come on!

31:45.904 --> 31:48.114
CHEN ZHEN

31:49.365 --> 31:50.325
You got Jeon?

31:50.825 --> 31:52.285
<i>He got away.</i>

31:52.368 --> 31:54.913
Jesus Christ! You had the guy cornered!

31:56.623 --> 31:57.540
What about the coke?

31:57.624 --> 31:59.042
I've got it.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.336
Take the coke and hide it in a safe place.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.671
Stay there until my call, got it?

32:21.940 --> 32:24.150
Don't worry about them.
Hurry up.

32:24.233 --> 32:27.612
I heard there was a shootout
in Paramaribo. Bodies everywhere.

32:28.154 --> 32:29.697
Is that what you planned? A massacre?

32:29.781 --> 32:31.866
No, nothing went according to plan.

32:32.367 --> 32:33.660
Jeon's still alive.

32:38.539 --> 32:40.583
The safest place for you now
is the US Embassy.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.921
We're gonna have to pull the plug
on the entire operation.

32:45.004 --> 32:47.548
I can make a few calls
to get a lid on the massacre here

32:48.049 --> 32:49.884
<i>and ensure your family stays safe.</i>

32:59.310 --> 33:00.144
Wait a second.

33:00.728 --> 33:03.147
This fiasco guarantees
the pastor and Chen Zhen

33:03.231 --> 33:05.191
will never consider
doing business together.

33:06.651 --> 33:09.404
So going forward,
Puerto Rico's back on the table.

33:09.487 --> 33:11.906
I think it would be better
if I play this out.

33:14.367 --> 33:16.035
I think you've gotten in
way over your head.

33:16.119 --> 33:19.080
-We're not playing a game here.
-There's a fucking understatement.

33:19.580 --> 33:21.290
I have to see Jeon again.

33:21.374 --> 33:22.750
It just might work out.

33:29.882 --> 33:33.136
I'll talk to you later, okay, Sangman?
And don't do anything I wouldn't do.

33:33.219 --> 33:34.053
Hmm?

33:34.137 --> 33:37.015
Brother Kang, Pastor Jeon
wants to talk to you. Come with us.

33:37.598 --> 33:38.766
He wants to talk.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.268
Hallelujah.

33:47.275 --> 33:50.194
I heard there was a shitload
of bullets flying earlier.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.947
And you also must've heard

33:53.031 --> 33:55.450
we had to abandon the warehouse
and all the coke.

33:55.533 --> 33:57.827
Yeah, and now Chen Zhen has it.

33:57.910 --> 34:01.998
So, we gathered everyone
whose ever been to the warehouse.

34:02.081 --> 34:03.332
Good call.

34:04.417 --> 34:06.210
Where the hell is it?

34:07.378 --> 34:08.212
Funny.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.299
You've taken pictures
inside there, asshole.

34:12.300 --> 34:15.595
Yeah, after I was taken there
with a hood on my head like a prisoner.

34:15.678 --> 34:17.972
These are regular glasses,
not X-ray goggles.

34:25.772 --> 34:27.398
You keep leaving without permission.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.738
You're the reason I had to leave.
Why would I ask for permission?

34:34.489 --> 34:36.866
You sent me to the hospital.
I wasn't gonna ask for a ride.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.743
Pastor.

34:38.826 --> 34:41.621
This demon shows no respect, and tries
to talk his way out of everything.

34:41.704 --> 34:42.538
If you'll allow me,

34:42.622 --> 34:45.041
the only way to get the truth out of him
is to inflict pain.

34:45.124 --> 34:47.710
You psycho fuck. Have you lost it? Huh?

34:47.794 --> 34:50.505
I think you're looking to compensate
for the ass-kicking you got.

34:50.588 --> 34:52.340
The warehouse? Huh?

34:52.423 --> 34:56.260
You had me put a bag over my head,
which threw my blood pressure, by the way.

34:56.344 --> 34:59.097
You guys made sure I didn't know
where the warehouse is.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.306
I'm the only one in this room

35:00.389 --> 35:02.266
who shouldn't be interrogated,
for Christ's sake!

35:03.309 --> 35:05.895
This is no way
to treat your business partners.

35:05.978 --> 35:08.564
It's obvious that the rat is one of you.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.984
This is the last straw.
Sangman and I are pulling out.

35:14.570 --> 35:16.322
Stay with us, Brother Kang.

35:16.405 --> 35:18.783
It would be a shame
to miss us doing God's work.

35:21.661 --> 35:24.330
I forgot to mention,
I narrowed down the list of suspects

35:24.413 --> 35:26.290
who would've been able
to cause all this trouble.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.210
Who planned the route to Brazil
and the ambush, huh?

35:29.293 --> 35:32.672
The same person who worked out
the details for today? Huh?

35:38.094 --> 35:40.721
The answer's right before your eyes.

35:40.805 --> 35:44.016
Why are you dragging it all out
when you already know who betrayed you?

35:44.100 --> 35:45.268
Shit!

35:45.935 --> 35:49.272
Serpentine fucker
trying to deflect suspicion.

35:49.355 --> 35:50.773
Look.

35:50.857 --> 35:53.234
What we need to focus on
is who actually benefits

35:53.317 --> 35:55.862
if our arrangement
with Chen falls through.

36:00.283 --> 36:02.368
-Shit.
-Transiting through Chinatown

36:02.451 --> 36:05.454
might be slower,
but Puerto Rico's a deathtrap.

36:05.538 --> 36:08.166
Yet you insist it's our only option!

36:08.249 --> 36:10.585
Who the hell do you think it is?!

36:10.668 --> 36:12.712
Ah!

36:17.550 --> 36:20.303
You have a lot of balls
raising your voice in my house.

36:25.641 --> 36:28.060
When I was on my way
to that shitshow at the warehouse earlier,

36:28.144 --> 36:29.854
I had Sangjun search the house.

36:29.937 --> 36:34.692
I had him go through all your belongings,
your rooms, your cars, the works.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.112
Every one of you.

36:41.991 --> 36:42.992
Of course…

36:48.998 --> 36:52.126
that included
special guests like you. Right?

37:01.177 --> 37:02.011
Go ahead,

37:02.845 --> 37:04.805
tell us who the trader is, Pastor.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.225
Then put a bullet through his head.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.606
What do you think of God's will?
The rat is dead.

38:38.190 --> 38:39.233
Satisfied?

38:49.660 --> 38:51.495
Stupid motherfucker.

38:52.955 --> 38:56.042
He was working
with that bastard Chen Zhen all along.

38:59.378 --> 39:02.631
Sangjun found this
in a secret compartment in David's car.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.717
He never reported
having this phone, obviously.

39:06.052 --> 39:07.345
We looked up the call history.

39:07.428 --> 39:09.972
And guess where
almost every single call was made.

39:12.433 --> 39:13.726
To a number…

39:14.810 --> 39:16.187
in the Chinatown area.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.111
David was at the top of my list.

39:25.279 --> 39:26.906
Yeah, but the thing…

39:28.282 --> 39:30.951
the thing is,
deep in my gut, it feels wrong.

39:32.119 --> 39:34.997
David was always a spineless coward.

39:35.081 --> 39:39.210
Something like this takes nerves of steel,
so he had to be working with someone.

39:45.508 --> 39:47.760
He probably just followed Chen's orders.

39:54.100 --> 39:57.895
Chen Zhen's tough,
but he has shit in here.

40:01.565 --> 40:02.775
They're puppets.

40:02.858 --> 40:06.070
Someone else is pulling the strings
and fucking with us.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.119
Look.

40:13.202 --> 40:14.787
I agree with you,
Chen's being an idiot,

40:14.870 --> 40:16.539
but that's for you to deal with.

40:17.373 --> 40:20.876
I just wanna get going, get the show
on the road, and move the coke.

40:22.461 --> 40:24.296
Where do we ship through, huh?

40:25.172 --> 40:26.340
Puerto Rico?

40:26.424 --> 40:27.383
Yeah.

40:28.342 --> 40:30.344
If we had just gone with Puerto Rico
from the start…

40:30.428 --> 40:32.012
Puerto Rico isn't happening.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.098
Chen Zhen got hold
of the entire shipment, remember?

40:34.181 --> 40:36.350
So get it back, asshole.

40:36.475 --> 40:38.769
What? You're just gonna let him steal
all your product?

40:39.520 --> 40:42.314
I mean, look. Didn't you use to be part
of the same gang?

40:42.398 --> 40:44.567
Make some calls,
and find out what your old friends know.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.195
I'm not calling those guys.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.405
Why not?

40:49.488 --> 40:52.199
If I were you,
I'd already be on the phone. Shit.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.785
Are you all gonna stand around
doing nothing?

40:57.163 --> 40:58.330
Fucking unbelievable.

40:58.414 --> 41:00.082
Christ. Come on, Jeon.

41:01.041 --> 41:02.543
Suriname is tiny, isn't it?

41:02.626 --> 41:05.421
All we have to do is put the word out,
and someone will come through.

41:11.051 --> 41:12.803
You haven't been excused yet, sir.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.388
The pastor isn't finished talking.

41:15.389 --> 41:16.891
Are you a robot or what?

41:16.974 --> 41:19.351
Hey, where's your sense of urgency?

41:19.435 --> 41:20.936
Are you sure you're Korean?

41:21.979 --> 41:25.232
Time is not on our side here.
We need to jump all over this.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.358
And get the coke.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.160
Sangjun.

41:37.286 --> 41:39.538
It's all right,
he'll bring the coke back to us.

41:57.973 --> 41:59.808
My God!

42:13.280 --> 42:16.200
SANGMAN, I THINK I'M DONE WITH THE PASTOR.
I'M MOVING ON MY OWN NOW.

42:16.283 --> 42:17.284
TO: SANGMAN

42:41.725 --> 42:43.018
Hey, go back!

42:45.062 --> 42:46.063
Move back!

42:48.691 --> 42:49.525
What're you doing?

42:49.608 --> 42:51.694
Go back.
Only Chinese can enter.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.280
What the hell did you say?

42:54.363 --> 42:56.365
Are you the police? Huh?

42:56.448 --> 42:57.449
Get the fuck away.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.618
You motherfucker.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.099
Ah, Chen Zhen.

43:22.182 --> 43:24.059
You're being careful. That's good.

43:24.143 --> 43:26.020
Problem is, I can't get in.

43:26.103 --> 43:28.731
<i>You knew Jeon</i>
<i>would put a tail on everyone.</i>

43:28.814 --> 43:30.774
<i>You said it yourself, stay safe.</i>

43:31.400 --> 43:33.319
Okay, okay, okay. I got it, I got it.

43:34.486 --> 43:36.113
You have the coke? Where is it?

43:36.196 --> 43:38.073
It's in a safe place.

43:40.159 --> 43:41.577
Where the hell is this place?

43:41.660 --> 43:44.580
What if I tell you and he tortures you?

43:45.831 --> 43:47.207
It's better you don't know.

43:47.833 --> 43:49.335
What? You're going to hide forever?

43:49.418 --> 43:50.461
Are you an idiot?

43:50.544 --> 43:52.630
The pastor is still alive.

43:53.172 --> 43:54.840
He's gonna try to kill me.

43:56.216 --> 43:59.345
I need to be sure I'm safe
before going out.

44:00.304 --> 44:03.140
If you want, you can kill him.

44:03.223 --> 44:06.977
Now he has too many guards.
It's impossible to get to him.

44:07.061 --> 44:10.439
If you kill him, everything would be fine,
but you failed.

44:11.065 --> 44:12.775
How can you stay like this?

44:13.859 --> 44:14.693
Let's meet and talk.

44:14.777 --> 44:16.945
Find a way to kill him, brother.

44:17.029 --> 44:18.280
Until then,

44:19.073 --> 44:21.408
hiding out here is the safest thing.

44:21.492 --> 44:22.743
For all of us.

44:56.276 --> 44:57.361
I was gonna wait,

44:57.444 --> 45:01.490
then tell the pastor where Chen Zhen
stashed the coke, but it didn't work out.

45:01.573 --> 45:04.535
The bastard wants to stay holed up
where he's safe.

45:09.790 --> 45:12.584
Yes, we're aware. We were monitoring
through another channel.

45:12.668 --> 45:16.672
You know Jeon's advisor David?
He was pretty much his right-hand man.

45:17.715 --> 45:18.882
Jeon took him out.

45:19.675 --> 45:21.301
He thought he was the trader.

45:21.385 --> 45:22.761
<i>I'm aware of that too.</i>

45:22.845 --> 45:23.929
So was he…

45:26.181 --> 45:27.057
Hold on.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.587
Jeon's guys are on my tail.

45:57.588 --> 46:00.507
I need you to make a move
pretty quick here, okay?

46:01.049 --> 46:02.760
Chen Zhen is focused on one thing.

46:02.843 --> 46:05.220
He says he won't budge unless I kill Jeon.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.771
-Ingu, what's going on?
-<i>Get off!</i>

46:13.854 --> 46:15.522
What the fuck is this?

46:17.900 --> 46:20.652
You idiot!
Are you out of your fucking mind?

46:20.736 --> 46:22.237
You bastard!

46:23.197 --> 46:24.531
Sangman and I are talking.

46:24.615 --> 46:27.576
That was Sangman?
Did he ask how the food was?

46:36.919 --> 46:38.170
This is Kim Heewon.

46:39.087 --> 46:41.298
The operation's in the toilet right now.

46:43.842 --> 46:45.052
Is this a W3?

46:45.636 --> 46:48.388
Yeah. I'll let you explain to Kang.

46:50.432 --> 46:51.266
Hey.

46:51.350 --> 46:52.559
Listen, Ingu.

46:53.268 --> 46:56.855
You're with agent Kim Heewon.
He's our NIS operative on the ground.

46:56.939 --> 46:59.858
You need to do what he tells you.
Listen to him, please.

47:01.735 --> 47:03.987
I don't know
what the hell is going on, but…

47:04.780 --> 47:06.073
I'll do what he says.

47:06.782 --> 47:08.116
We have to get moving.

47:14.206 --> 47:15.666
I'll explain what I can.

47:15.749 --> 47:17.084
We have to be careful.

47:17.584 --> 47:20.671
Sangjun is here too.
Jeon told us to watch your every move.

47:20.754 --> 47:22.005
Let me get this straight.

47:22.089 --> 47:23.966
You started off
in Chen Zhen's Chinatown gang,

47:24.049 --> 47:25.592
then pretended to defend the pastor?

47:25.676 --> 47:27.636
It's not the time to discuss that.

47:27.719 --> 47:30.347
The ambush at the warehouse.
Were you behind that?

47:30.430 --> 47:31.390
Yeah.

47:31.473 --> 47:33.725
You know killing Jeon
solves absolutely nothing?

47:33.809 --> 47:36.228
Otherwise,
I would've done it myself on day one.

47:36.311 --> 47:38.647
So your solution is making civilians
part of your plans,

47:38.730 --> 47:40.148
and blaming them when it goes wrong?

47:40.732 --> 47:42.860
I'm cheap labor.
I expect at least a thank you.

47:42.943 --> 47:44.736
You'd have a bullet
through your head right now

47:44.820 --> 47:47.447
if I hadn't planted that phone
in David's car, Brother Kang.

47:48.448 --> 47:50.242
You're the one who should be thankful.

48:09.761 --> 48:12.556
From now on, you only do
what agent Choi and I tell you.

48:12.639 --> 48:14.808
No more flying by
because what you do affects

48:14.892 --> 48:18.020
not only everyone in Suriname,
but the people at home too. Am I clear?

48:21.732 --> 48:23.775
I'm aware of the consequences,

48:23.859 --> 48:25.319
but show some respect.

48:25.402 --> 48:26.570
Aren't we the same age?

48:27.154 --> 48:28.322
What?

48:28.405 --> 48:30.324
I can treat you more like Byun
if you prefer.

48:32.367 --> 48:33.952
You know we're the same age.

48:37.998 --> 48:38.832
Sure.

48:44.671 --> 48:46.590
Your plan was to get Chen
to tell you where he was

48:46.673 --> 48:47.966
so Jeon could get the coke.

48:48.050 --> 48:49.468
And so will to Puerto Rico, right?

48:50.052 --> 48:51.970
Yeah, only Chen Zhen
is holed up who knows where,

48:52.054 --> 48:53.096
so that blew up in my face.

48:54.640 --> 48:57.351
Sangjun and I were told to follow you,
while I try to find the coke

48:57.434 --> 48:59.811
using all my past connections
like you suggested.

48:59.895 --> 49:03.732
There must be only a few places
where Chen and the cocaine could be safe.

49:03.815 --> 49:06.109
I know of about five or six, at most.

49:06.193 --> 49:08.779
Only he's mobilized his forces
to block all access to Chinatown,

49:08.862 --> 49:09.905
so we're screwed.

49:17.120 --> 49:18.246
Hold on a minute.

49:19.831 --> 49:22.000
He doesn't want to see you,
but he'll take your calls?

49:34.554 --> 49:37.307
PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, SURINAME

49:54.199 --> 49:58.161
You bring me such difficult decision
so early in the morning.

50:01.248 --> 50:04.918
The presidential election is coming up.
Don't you want to be re-elected?

50:06.211 --> 50:08.755
You could be in trouble
if things stay this way.

50:08.839 --> 50:10.215
Exactly.

50:10.298 --> 50:14.845
That's why we need to manage
the Chinese votes more carefully.

50:15.554 --> 50:18.849
Foolish to send troops
to Chinatown so easily.

50:31.153 --> 50:31.987
Come on up.

50:36.742 --> 50:40.704
You know about that dead body hanging
in the Chinatown streets?

50:40.787 --> 50:41.788
I do.

50:41.872 --> 50:44.541
The Chinese mob moss Chen Zhen
put him there

50:44.624 --> 50:46.543
after cutting off his hands and feet.

50:47.127 --> 50:50.380
The Chinese community
has been complaining about him

50:50.464 --> 50:52.382
and this makes them more upset.

50:54.843 --> 50:58.013
Doesn't he control Chinese votes anyway?

50:58.096 --> 51:00.724
What if I told you
I could get him replaced?

51:01.433 --> 51:02.392
What?

51:03.268 --> 51:04.311
Are you kidding me?

51:08.231 --> 51:09.441
Come in!

51:26.458 --> 51:28.919
He is the man
who will become the new boss.

51:30.504 --> 51:33.715
He knows the Chinese family very well.

51:33.799 --> 51:38.303
He is Korean-Chinese,
so he can communicate with everyone.

51:39.471 --> 51:40.889
Most important,

51:41.765 --> 51:44.684
his belief in God is deep.

51:45.268 --> 51:46.978
That's good point.

51:47.062 --> 51:52.400
But killing a Chinese man
will make Chinese people more angry.

51:53.443 --> 51:56.029
I'll send someone to watch over situation.

51:56.988 --> 51:59.282
Watch what?

52:01.118 --> 52:04.121
Our fate will be decided
in just a few hours!

52:04.204 --> 52:06.206
In the worst case,

52:06.289 --> 52:08.333
Cali can kill us.
Why don't you understand?!

52:10.627 --> 52:12.546
How dare you, Pastor?

52:34.234 --> 52:37.445
I'm not telling you to stop
controlling the votes,

52:39.489 --> 52:42.284
but to replace the manager

52:43.326 --> 52:45.287
with someone more useful.

52:45.871 --> 52:48.039
I'll get you re-elected.

52:48.790 --> 52:52.669
Just send in your troops,
and I'll let you know what to do next.

53:01.511 --> 53:02.888
Mr. President,

53:04.181 --> 53:05.682
I promise you this.

53:06.308 --> 53:07.434
If you decide now,

53:08.810 --> 53:12.147
you will make
one million more every month.

53:13.857 --> 53:14.816
At least.

53:27.662 --> 53:30.749
General Henk,
this is the president.

53:31.875 --> 53:35.003
Which troop is available
to be mobilized now?

53:37.255 --> 53:38.798
To Chinatown.

53:40.008 --> 53:41.509
Hallelujah.

54:49.869 --> 54:52.038
Everybody, fire!

55:36.875 --> 55:39.336
Boss! Soldiers have barged into Chinatown!

55:39.419 --> 55:41.087
They're killing our brothers down there!

55:48.678 --> 55:51.264
-Get more things!
-Find your places!

55:51.348 --> 55:54.434
This is an operation
to root out the gang

55:54.517 --> 55:57.103
that is involved in murders and drugs.

55:57.187 --> 56:01.858
We will not harm innocent civilians,
so stay in your homes.

56:02.484 --> 56:03.318
I repeat.

56:04.027 --> 56:09.532
This is an operation to root out the gang
involved in murders and drugs.

56:09.616 --> 56:14.371
We will not harm innocent civilians,

56:14.454 --> 56:18.291
so stay in your homes.

56:39.771 --> 56:42.440
-What is happening?
-Pastor sent the army. Where are you?

56:43.066 --> 56:45.026
The army has surrounded me completely!

56:45.110 --> 56:46.486
What the fuck is happening?

56:46.569 --> 56:48.780
Hang in there. I'll get you out.

56:48.863 --> 56:50.198
Where are you now?

56:51.324 --> 56:53.743
The soldiers will find you soon. Tell me!

56:56.204 --> 56:57.080
At Wang's shop.

56:59.958 --> 57:00.792
Okay.

57:00.875 --> 57:02.627
Wait there. I'll tell you what to do.

57:19.811 --> 57:20.895
Fire!

57:21.646 --> 57:22.772
Shoot them!

58:21.873 --> 58:22.707
Hey, brother.

58:23.791 --> 58:24.959
What should I do?

58:31.966 --> 58:33.176
You fucking--

58:53.571 --> 58:54.781
PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE, SURINAME

58:54.864 --> 59:00.411
The drug ring that's persecuted
and killed the people of Suriname

59:00.495 --> 59:01.663
has been rooted out.

59:01.746 --> 59:06.626
Innocent lives have been sacrificed
due to this war,

59:07.460 --> 59:10.505
but we won in the end.

59:13.716 --> 59:17.512
<i>Remind yourself of the motto of Suriname,</i>

59:17.595 --> 59:21.599
<i>justice, piety, and fidelity.</i>

59:22.850 --> 59:26.062
<i>Today, we made a statement.</i>

59:26.771 --> 59:28.898
<i>With piety, we found justice</i>
<i>and protected our fidelity.</i>

59:28.982 --> 59:30.233
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

59:30.316 --> 59:33.695
<i>We thank God for protecting us.</i>

59:33.778 --> 59:37.824
<i>Fellow citizens, let us all pray</i>

59:37.907 --> 59:41.369
<i>for Suriname tonight.</i>

59:41.911 --> 59:42.912
<i>Amen.</i>

59:48.126 --> 59:51.254
<i>You're watching</i>
<i>live footage from the Suriname capital.</i>

59:51.337 --> 59:54.966
<i>The Suriname government has</i>
<i>proclaimed war against a local drug gang.</i>

59:55.049 --> 59:58.261
<i>It is said to be behind</i>
<i>the recent Brazilian border skirmish</i>

59:58.344 --> 1:00:00.054
<i>and the Paramaribo massacre.</i>

1:00:01.222 --> 1:00:02.432
Today, God Almighty,

1:00:02.515 --> 1:00:05.184
Commander of the armies of heaven
took revenge on his enemies.

1:00:05.268 --> 1:00:08.855
Tonight we celebrate
as our savior's vengeance burns bright.

1:00:08.938 --> 1:00:11.816
The Lord's sword is satisfied
after slaying his enemy.

1:00:11.899 --> 1:00:13.151
Amen!

1:00:13.234 --> 1:00:15.236
Brothers and sisters of the truth,

1:00:15.320 --> 1:00:19.198
you are witness to what I prophesized
and to what our Lord promised.

1:00:19.282 --> 1:00:22.785
Our fellow worshipers
who gave their lives to protect us

1:00:22.869 --> 1:00:24.329
are in a better place.

1:00:24.412 --> 1:00:25.538
In God's holy grace,

1:00:25.622 --> 1:00:30.293
all of Suriname is a holy temple worthy
of our Lord's domain.

1:00:30.376 --> 1:00:33.755
Let us praise our God
by lifting our voices to heaven.

1:00:33.838 --> 1:00:35.715
Amen!

1:00:53.983 --> 1:00:55.485
Excuse me, ladies.

1:01:04.077 --> 1:01:07.038
I was told you were instrumental
in getting Chen out of hiding

1:01:07.121 --> 1:01:09.040
and getting my coke back,
like you said you would.

1:01:09.874 --> 1:01:10.958
True on both counts.

1:01:18.675 --> 1:01:20.259
I have to admit, you pissed me off.

1:01:20.343 --> 1:01:22.929
Except, I appreciate a man
who stands his ground.

1:01:23.012 --> 1:01:25.723
The promise of money
helped me grow roots like an oak.

1:01:25.807 --> 1:01:28.935
I thought this might be the storm
that finally knocked me over.

1:01:29.519 --> 1:01:32.397
It's gotten a lot harder
to stay standing through it all.

1:01:36.901 --> 1:01:37.735
Pastor.

1:01:43.241 --> 1:01:44.158
What's going on?

1:01:44.242 --> 1:01:46.536
We're getting resistance
from Chen's European dealers.

1:01:46.619 --> 1:01:48.746
The ones from mainland China
want nothing to do with us.

1:01:48.830 --> 1:01:51.332
If we have to bypass those guys,
we'll need to find another route,

1:01:51.416 --> 1:01:53.042
which will change the whole timeframe.

1:01:53.126 --> 1:01:54.168
So how long?

1:01:54.252 --> 1:01:56.504
Tell me how long for us
to move all of our product.

1:01:56.587 --> 1:01:58.381
We're looking at, uh…

1:01:59.424 --> 1:02:01.175
around three to four months, sir.

1:02:29.036 --> 1:02:30.329
Ingu, what's up?

1:02:30.997 --> 1:02:33.624
Where are you? Getting a good breakfast?

1:02:33.708 --> 1:02:36.669
<i> Just finished. I ate so much,</i>
<i>I think my stomach's about to explode.</i>

1:02:36.753 --> 1:02:39.672
<i>Sangman, listen.</i>
<i>Pastor Jeon wants to talk to you.</i>

1:02:40.465 --> 1:02:41.799
<i>It's been a while, brother.</i>

1:02:42.675 --> 1:02:43.968
Yes, it has.

1:02:44.051 --> 1:02:45.678
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

1:02:47.638 --> 1:02:49.682
I have one question to ask you.

1:02:49.766 --> 1:02:52.810
Is Puerto Rico still a viable option
at this point?

1:02:54.395 --> 1:02:56.522
Why do you ask?

1:02:59.150 --> 1:03:02.153
<i>if we could let bygones be bygones</i>

1:03:02.236 --> 1:03:04.697
<i>and continue our previous discussion.</i>

1:03:04.781 --> 1:03:07.116
"Once burned, twice shy."
You know this saying?

1:03:07.742 --> 1:03:10.578
I'm not sure I can trust you
not to back out on us again.

1:03:12.747 --> 1:03:14.874
I understand you 100%.

1:03:16.292 --> 1:03:17.794
Trust is hard to earn,

1:03:17.877 --> 1:03:20.171
so I propose a deal
that will help with that.

1:03:23.466 --> 1:03:24.717
Another deal, Jeon?

1:03:24.801 --> 1:03:27.011
I've trusted you before,
and it's gotten me nowhere.

1:03:27.094 --> 1:03:28.054
<i>I know that.</i>

1:03:28.137 --> 1:03:29.180
Listen.

1:03:30.014 --> 1:03:31.599
Can you confirm something here?

1:03:32.391 --> 1:03:34.352
If I put all the product in one shipment,

1:03:34.435 --> 1:03:36.813
could you transfer the payment
all in one shot?

1:03:41.692 --> 1:03:42.568
Hmm.

1:03:42.652 --> 1:03:44.111
I've committed those funds elsewhere,

1:03:44.195 --> 1:03:46.280
since I didn't think
the deal was happening.

1:03:46.364 --> 1:03:48.032
I'll have to check my numbers again.

1:03:48.783 --> 1:03:51.744
There's a chance by the time Brother Kang
can get the goods to Puerto Rico,

1:03:51.828 --> 1:03:54.205
I might be able to secure the cash.

1:03:54.288 --> 1:03:55.623
Although, there's still…

1:03:56.165 --> 1:03:57.917
the fact that I don't trust you one bit.

1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.419
Confirm you can pay on arrival,

1:04:00.503 --> 1:04:03.047
and I'll get the goods to Puerto Rico
as soon as I can.

1:04:08.511 --> 1:04:09.804
Soon as you can?

1:04:10.847 --> 1:04:13.015
I'll need a bit more to go on.

1:04:15.977 --> 1:04:17.645
With the contacts I have here,

1:04:17.728 --> 1:04:20.189
when I ask for a plane,
they don't ask questions.

1:04:25.820 --> 1:04:28.865
I'm gonna call it in for takeoff
in about three hours.

1:04:28.948 --> 1:04:30.241
Can you move it that quickly?

1:04:35.746 --> 1:04:37.123
You have a deal, Jeon.

1:04:37.832 --> 1:04:40.251
Great. I knew it'd work.

1:04:47.717 --> 1:04:49.552
Oh wow!

1:04:49.635 --> 1:04:51.304
Oh, you did it! Great work!

1:04:51.387 --> 1:04:52.889
Good job, everybody!

1:04:52.972 --> 1:04:54.724
-We did it!
-Way to go.

1:04:55.975 --> 1:04:58.352
Brother Kang, the game is on.

1:04:59.770 --> 1:05:00.605
Finally.

1:05:01.647 --> 1:05:04.358
Looks like the deep-rooted tree
is about to bear fruit.
