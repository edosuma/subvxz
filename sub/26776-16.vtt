[ lion roars ]

20:53.819 --> 20:54.920
- Shut up lion!

20:54.987 --> 20:56.888
I'm in the middle
of something here.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.729
- Hey, I'm sorry
that things got weird

21:03.795 --> 21:05.430
between us because
of my dream.

21:05.497 --> 21:07.733
- Don't worry about it.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.571
I'm just glad everything's
normal again.

21:12.638 --> 21:14.072
And that you didn't
get eaten by a lion.

21:14.139 --> 21:16.208
- I know, right?

21:16.274 --> 21:18.176
How about a little bet?

21:18.243 --> 21:19.544
- Okay.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.279
- If I miss this putt.

21:21.346 --> 21:22.781
You and I kiss.

21:24.483 --> 21:26.818
- Uh...what?!

21:27.919 --> 21:29.621
- Oops.

21:31.657 --> 21:33.959
- What...
what is...happening--

21:34.026 --> 21:37.262
- Quiet, Henry.
I'm working on something here...

21:37.329 --> 21:38.296
- Lips!

21:38.363 --> 21:41.533
- What?
- Ahh!

21:41.600 --> 21:42.968
- Did you just say "lips?"
- What?

21:43.035 --> 21:45.103
No I don't even know
what that word means.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.206
- There's a phone on your face.

21:48.273 --> 21:49.975
- Oh yeah!
That's because I was...

21:50.042 --> 21:53.712
expecting a call, so,
I put it on my face, so...

21:57.449 --> 21:59.384
Where is this elevator?
