WEBVTT

00:05.773 --> 00:08.109
Previously, on ER:

00:08.141 --> 00:09.443
My car's just up the street.

00:09.477 --> 00:10.778
You want a ride?
Dr. Romano, you're back.

00:10.811 --> 00:12.213
Yeah, try to hide

00:12.246 --> 00:13.581
your wild enthusiasm
at my return.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.483
I find overt displays
of emotion embarrassing.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.817
Do you even think about me?

00:16.850 --> 00:19.287
Yes.
Okay, what did you think?

00:20.621 --> 00:21.589
Ah.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.457
Where am I going?
Home!

00:23.491 --> 00:25.426
Give this to Abby
when you see her.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.599
ABBY:
On any given day

00:31.632 --> 00:33.601
this emergency department
will treat 300 patients.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.170
Another 40 will leave
without ever being seen.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.705
In order to not get buried,

00:37.738 --> 00:41.542
you have to maintain
adequate patient flow.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.377
This all starts
with the nurses.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.578
Treat them with respect,

00:44.612 --> 00:46.214
they'll get you
through your shift.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.815
Treat them as your own
personal scut slaves,

00:47.848 --> 00:49.550
you'll be lucky
to get out of here alive.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.752
Triage is our first line
of defense.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.654
Patients are signed in
and vitalled

00:53.687 --> 00:55.656
by whoever's working the cage.
The cage?

00:55.689 --> 00:57.691
Yeah, like a shark cage.

00:57.725 --> 00:58.859
You can see them out there
circling around,

00:58.892 --> 01:00.161
but they can't get at you.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.362
When's Kovac
getting here?

01:01.395 --> 01:02.696
His flight was supposed
to land at 7:30.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.132
What about Carter?

01:04.132 --> 01:05.699
Can you rack this?

01:05.733 --> 01:08.569
Triage nurse starts the chart,
which is racked at Admit.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.404
TAKATA:
You need to put your name in
for the lottery.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.173
Okay, once the patients
are brought back,

01:12.206 --> 01:13.607
their name is put on the board,

01:13.641 --> 01:17.711
along with time, location,
and chief complaint.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.613
Dr. Pratt is also
a second-year resident.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.582
Pratt, this is three
of our new R2s.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.217
Sofun, Morris, Cooper.

01:23.251 --> 01:24.252
Welcome to the zoo.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.187
What can I give
a ten-year-old

01:26.220 --> 01:28.556
with painful road rash?
Acetaminophen's easy
on the stomach,

01:28.589 --> 01:30.858
but ibuprofen's better
for inflammation.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.293
Med students work up
the patients

01:32.326 --> 01:33.727
and present them
to the residents.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.630
You can mentor them,
but ultimately every case

01:36.664 --> 01:37.865
has to be looked at
by an attending.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.467
MAN:
I know my rights!

01:39.500 --> 01:40.734
This is assault and battery!

01:40.768 --> 01:42.703
I'm coming back
for you, bitch.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.239
Yeah, yeah,
bring me a latte when you do.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.208
Dr. Lewis is one
of our attendings.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.742
We usually we have
two working.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.344
They have to sign off
on every case.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.446
Uh, don't remind me.
Second-year residents?

01:52.480 --> 01:54.682
Cooper, Sofun, Morris.

01:54.715 --> 01:55.683
Grab a chart.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.351
Abby, can you set up

01:57.385 --> 01:59.187
the airway box in Exam Three
so the med students

01:59.220 --> 02:01.189
can practice assembling
laryngoscopes?

02:01.189 --> 02:02.690
Mm-hmm.

02:02.723 --> 02:03.657
Nursing orders go there.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.193
Clerk orders go here.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.261
These are two of our clerks,
Jerry and Frank.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.762
Please don't feed them.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.565
And when you're done,
the discharge rack is over here.

02:11.599 --> 02:12.800
Any questions?

02:12.833 --> 02:15.303
Yeah, why is
the board see-through?

02:15.336 --> 02:17.238
So we can see through it.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.240
Remind me not to get
sick anytime soon.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.341
The ambulance pick Luka up yet?

02:20.374 --> 02:21.409
Yeah, about an hour ago.

02:21.442 --> 02:22.543
They should be here any minute.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.911
Is he going to need
a bed down here?

02:23.944 --> 02:25.513
No, no, they've got one
for him upstairs.

02:25.546 --> 02:26.880
Have you seen
the new schedule?

02:26.914 --> 02:29.483
I'm only working four
shifts in two weeks.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.352
I only got three.
How many do I have?

02:31.385 --> 02:32.953
Two?
We're starting
a petition.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.655
We've got more beds,
but fewer nurses.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.724
And now Romano's cutting
senior nurse hours

02:36.757 --> 02:38.492
so he can bring in
cheaper travelers.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.261
You're the charge nurse.
You need to talk to him.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.695
You lost
the triage lottery, Abby.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.297
You've got the cage
from 9:00 till 1:00.

02:43.331 --> 02:44.932
Oh, come on, no way!

02:44.965 --> 02:46.300
I lose every time!

02:46.334 --> 02:48.236
That's like
statistically impossible.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.737
Abby!
What?

02:56.310 --> 02:57.678
Hey, I need you to help me
with a GI bleeder.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.248
Okay, two minutes.
Just let me say hi to Luka.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.782
( metal crashing )

03:01.815 --> 03:04.852
Sir! You have
to stay in bed.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.387
Here, lie down.
Lie down.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.489
I need sedation
orders over here.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.790
I think
Mrs. Dunn's in labor.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.392
She's only 36 weeks.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.261
Explain Braxton Hicks
contractions to her.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.763
Her water broke.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.331
Did you nitrazine it?

03:17.365 --> 03:18.832
No, I was just helping her
to the bathroom.

03:18.866 --> 03:22.603
Uh, okay, well, page OB
and, and call an attending.

03:22.636 --> 03:23.804
( screams )

03:23.837 --> 03:26.907
Hi. Okay, breathe.
Don't push.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.876
It's too early.

03:28.909 --> 03:32.446
No, 36 weeks is what
we start calling "normal term."

03:32.480 --> 03:34.715
All right, try and relax.
I'm going to do a quick exam.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.450
I need a fetal monitor
and an IV.

03:36.484 --> 03:37.751
Okay. I got it.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:48.729 --> 03:51.565
Oh, Lewis needs that
in Curtain One.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.566
Thank you.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.634
Can you show me

03:53.667 --> 03:54.668
how to set up the slit lamp?

03:54.702 --> 03:56.604
Yup, just
one second.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.705
Luka!

03:59.873 --> 04:02.510
Hey, hey, I think this
old lady stopped breathing.

04:56.664 --> 04:57.731
Dr. Romano, hi.
How are you today?

04:57.765 --> 04:58.799
I'm busy.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.468
How's the stump
feeling?

05:00.501 --> 05:04.772
It's, uh, suffering
from delusions of grandeur.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.608
It still thinks
it's an arm.

05:10.744 --> 05:11.679
What's that?

05:11.712 --> 05:14.014
Your new prosthesis.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.783
Okay...

05:15.816 --> 05:17.918
I'm sorry. I just assumed
as a prosthetist,

05:17.951 --> 05:19.387
that you would have some

05:19.387 --> 05:20.721
rudimentary knowledge
of medicine.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.424
I have a degree
in bioengineering.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.592
Oh, okay, well, then
you have a vague,

05:24.625 --> 05:26.394
civilian concept
of what doctors do.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.828
See, I'm what's
called a surgeon.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.830
That's why I was very specific
about needing a Utah Arm.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.832
Your hospital insurance
won't cover

05:31.865 --> 05:33.434
a myoelectric device.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.805
I lost my arm on the roof
of this damn hospital

05:37.838 --> 05:39.106
trying to save
a patient's life.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.641
The insurance company
requires proof

05:40.674 --> 05:41.975
that you can't get by
with a traditional

05:42.009 --> 05:42.943
body-powered device.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.412
What am I supposed to do?

05:44.412 --> 05:45.813
Am I supposed to just
duct-tape a, a, a...

05:45.846 --> 05:47.681
coat hanger

05:47.715 --> 05:48.682
to my stump?

05:50.618 --> 05:52.753
I can prepare another letter
to the insurance company.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.955
I've got two letters for you
and the insurance company:

05:54.988 --> 05:56.056
F and U.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.658
It's hurting my arm.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.792
Just a little
bit longer.

05:58.826 --> 05:59.960
Why can't I just
have my prescription

05:59.993 --> 06:01.562
filled without
being tortured?

06:01.595 --> 06:02.796
( pounding on glass )

06:02.830 --> 06:04.698
How much longer?
My back is killing me.

06:04.732 --> 06:05.733
I'll let you know.

06:05.766 --> 06:06.834
I don't want to miss my turn.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.936
Then you should sit down.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.438
Okay...

06:10.438 --> 06:12.906
put this in your mouth.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.445
Be a good girl, Ilanna.
Open your mouth.

06:22.082 --> 06:25.018
I think it was a black widow.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.188
WOMAN:
Darren, don't touch that.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.823
Hey, ooh, hey, hey...

06:29.857 --> 06:31.191
Darren, stop it.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.926
( knocking ):
Is it almost my time?

06:32.960 --> 06:33.861
No.

06:36.664 --> 06:37.865
Tell her.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.501
Tell the nurse
what you ate, Lisa.

06:40.534 --> 06:41.902
Well, go on!
Tell her!

06:41.935 --> 06:43.837
Maybe you should tell me,
Mrs. Brandenburg.

06:45.539 --> 06:48.776
I brought my own urine sample
to save time.

07:14.968 --> 07:15.736
Could I at least get

07:15.769 --> 07:17.004
a sandwich?

07:17.037 --> 07:20.541
How did you get back here?
Security!

07:20.574 --> 07:22.576
Hey, wake up!

07:22.610 --> 07:24.044
She's getting worse.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.679
Do you have
asthma, Elle?

07:25.713 --> 07:26.914
No.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.582
Anybody sick at home?
Any fevers?
No.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.884
Okay, deep breaths.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.520
( coughing )

07:32.520 --> 07:33.987
How long have you
had that cough?

07:34.021 --> 07:35.689
Since we went camping.

07:35.723 --> 07:38.058
Uh... a few weeks, maybe.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.226
She lets herself
get run down

07:39.259 --> 07:40.928
and she doesn't eat enough.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.563
( alarm beeping )

07:42.596 --> 07:43.664
What's that?

07:43.697 --> 07:45.265
Um, the oxygen level
in your blood

07:45.298 --> 07:46.567
is a little bit low,

07:46.600 --> 07:48.068
which can happen
with infection.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.603
Frank, what's open?

07:49.637 --> 07:50.904
Curtain One.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.072
Okay, I'm taking this one back.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.073
Come on, Elle.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.241
Going to put you in a bed,

07:54.274 --> 07:55.609
get you some oxygen,

07:55.643 --> 07:56.944
and that should
make you feel better.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.580
Oh, Dr. Lewis.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.181
This is Mrs. Ryser
and her daughter, Elle--

08:01.214 --> 08:03.851
shortness of breath,
sats are 86, bibasilar rales.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.753
Uh, yeah, can you
grab a resident?

08:05.786 --> 08:07.788
I think an attending
should take a look at her.

08:07.821 --> 08:11.992
Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis.
Come on this way.

08:12.025 --> 08:12.993
The rest of her vitals okay?

08:13.026 --> 08:16.096
Tachy at 116.
BP's 98/52.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.264
A&O times three.

08:17.297 --> 08:18.966
What are rales?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.101
It's the sound fluid makes
when it's in your lungs.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.604
That doesn't sound good.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.172
It's probably
just pneumonia.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.907
Great. She never
dresses warm enough

08:26.940 --> 08:29.176
and she's always going
out with wet hair.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.177
Mom, please...

08:30.210 --> 08:31.311
All right, let's
get a chest.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.880
I'll be back
to do a full exam, okay?

08:32.913 --> 08:34.114
Thanks.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.148
Are you coming back?

08:35.182 --> 08:37.618
Yeah. Don't worry.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.986
The only thing you
can catch from wet hair

08:39.019 --> 08:40.587
is split ends.

08:42.923 --> 08:45.025
Yeah, send her for
a chest and draw a CBC.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.259
How's Luka?

08:46.293 --> 08:48.161
I haven't had a chance
to get upstairs.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.663
Well, uh, if you
do go upstairs,

08:49.697 --> 08:50.664
let me know and
maybe I can come.

08:50.698 --> 08:51.765
Okay.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.000
Have you talked to him?
Luka?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.101
No, Romano. We gave him
the petition.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.636
You better do something quick

08:55.669 --> 08:56.904
or you're going to have
a mutiny on your hands.

08:56.937 --> 09:00.708
As soon as I can,
I will, I promise.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.309
Frank, where'd they send Kovac?

09:02.342 --> 09:05.212
5 West.
He looks good.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.714
You saw him?

09:06.747 --> 09:09.282
Just popped my head in
to welcome him back.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.952
Wouldn't hurt you
to do the same thing.

09:11.985 --> 09:15.188
Hi, could I get an update
on a patient, please? Kovac.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.290
K-O-V-A-C.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.759
Right, malaria.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.160
He's still spiking

09:20.193 --> 09:22.295
on quinine,
but lucid between fevers.

09:22.329 --> 09:25.833
And he's asking
for a meatball sub.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.936
Either he's delirious
or hungry.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.337
Never mind.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.271
Hi.
Hi.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.239
I'm Gillian.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.907
Abby.
Oh, you're Abby?

09:33.941 --> 09:35.208
John talked a lot about you.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.277
John...

09:37.310 --> 09:38.145
Carter?

09:38.178 --> 09:40.280
Yeah.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.650
I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?

09:42.650 --> 09:44.251
I'm sorry. You don't know.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.253
I'm Gillian. I was working
with Luka and John in the Congo.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.221
Ah.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.291
Oh, I have something for you.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.696
Um, John asked Luka
to give you this.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.933
He wrote me a letter?

09:59.967 --> 10:01.268
Now there's a lost art.

10:01.301 --> 10:04.404
Uh, well, it's hard
to find a phone

10:04.437 --> 10:05.939
and when you do,
they seldom work.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.776
Uh, where do I find
Dr. Magoo's?

10:08.809 --> 10:09.877
You don't.
It burned down.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.278
Thank you.
You're welcome.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.313
Nance, I'm taking my break.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.748
Am I interrupting?

10:14.782 --> 10:15.849
Your assistant
wasn't at his desk.

10:15.883 --> 10:16.984
We're in the middle
of a meeting.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.185
Oh, well,
that would explain

10:18.218 --> 10:19.753
why you haven't returned
any of my pages.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.021
Hi, I'm Dr. Romano...
( crashing )

10:21.054 --> 10:21.989
Ah, geez.

10:22.022 --> 10:22.990
I'm sorry.
Let me get that.

10:23.023 --> 10:23.991
Ow!
Okay. Stop.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.358
You know what?

10:25.392 --> 10:27.160
I'm just not very good
at using this thing.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.962
You know, maybe
if the hospital's
worker's comp

10:28.996 --> 10:30.063
had covered a
myoelectric arm,

10:30.097 --> 10:31.832
it would be better.
Robert...

10:31.865 --> 10:33.734
You know, what do I have to do?
Pay for the damn thing myself?

10:33.767 --> 10:35.736
Hey, that'd make a good
news story, don't you think?

10:35.769 --> 10:37.337
Amputee surgeon has
to pay for his own arm

10:37.370 --> 10:39.406
to work in the hospital
where he lost it.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.074
This is not the place
or the time to discuss this.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.309
You know, you're right.
I've got a lot

10:42.342 --> 10:43.877
of patients to see in the ER,

10:43.911 --> 10:45.378
and, you know,
that's where using this hook

10:45.412 --> 10:46.346
really gets kind of dicey.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.015
Well, wish me luck.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.650
Hopefully I won't take someone's
eye out with this thing.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.300
We're staging a walkout.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.802
We're all meeting
at Dunkin' Donuts

11:08.836 --> 11:10.137
to come up with a plan.
What?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.271
If we don't
take a stand now,

11:11.304 --> 11:12.806
they're going to replace us all

11:12.840 --> 11:13.774
with part-time nurses
so they don't have

11:13.807 --> 11:15.042
to pay benefits.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.109
Yeah, they're welcome
to replace me.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.410
Is anybody working here today?

11:17.444 --> 11:18.812
Talk to Dr. Romano.

11:18.846 --> 11:19.847
I will.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.081
You know, a joker just fainted

11:21.114 --> 11:22.082
in the waiting area.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.450
Took a header into an end table.

11:23.483 --> 11:24.885
There's blood
everywhere.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.453
Abby?

11:29.122 --> 11:30.924
Why are you telling me this?

11:30.958 --> 11:33.193
Well, according to my watch,
your break is over.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.205
That's right.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.975
Leave me to pick up after you.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.112
Hey, wait.
Hold up, hold up.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.314
( panting )

11:56.316 --> 11:57.384
Sorry.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.786
I just ran
down from CT.

11:58.786 --> 11:59.853
You're Pratt, right?

11:59.887 --> 12:00.854
Nick Cooper, second-
year resident.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.222
My friends call me Coop.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.857
Hey, listen, who do I
get for an unstable

12:03.891 --> 12:05.125
mandible fracture--
plastics or head and neck?

12:05.158 --> 12:06.426
Call them both and take
whoever comes first.

12:06.459 --> 12:07.861
What do I tell the other one?

12:07.895 --> 12:09.196
Tell 'em the
patient eloped.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.798
They'll be happy

12:10.831 --> 12:12.032
'cause it's one less
consult for their team.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.867
Cool.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.869
Hey, listen, man, you new guys
got to start picking it up.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.204
It's only 10:30 and we're
already 20 patients behind.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.972
Well, I got six.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.273
Yeah, but the other two
are draggin' their asses.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.875
Morris has an LOL
with abdominal pain

12:21.909 --> 12:23.010
and altered mental status.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.245
It's a big workup.
It's possible LP.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.847
Sofun's still getting
the lay of the land.

12:26.880 --> 12:27.915
They're killing me.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.216
Hey, man, don't
worry about it.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.417
Look, we'll blast
through these.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.819
Let me see what you got.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.253
Epistaxis and vertigo.

12:33.286 --> 12:36.489
Nasal pack for the nosebleed,
Meclizine for the vertigo.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.058
They're out the door in 20.

12:40.493 --> 12:44.497
( speaking softly in Punjabi )

12:47.367 --> 12:48.836
How's it going?

12:48.869 --> 12:51.104
Oh. Ah... rather deep.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.506
I used a 4-0 Vicryl subq.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.975
Nice.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.509
What was that that you
were just saying?

12:56.543 --> 12:58.011
Nothing.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.446
I heard you talking to him.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.548
It was a prayer.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.484
He's not dying.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.386
It wasn't for him.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.454
It's a private prayer.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.222
Oh, something like, uh...

13:09.256 --> 13:11.859
"Please, Lord, don't let me
kill somebody today?"

13:11.892 --> 13:13.260
Somewhere along those lines?

13:13.293 --> 13:14.594
( chuckles )

13:14.627 --> 13:17.197
Neela, I need you to run down
to medical records

13:17.230 --> 13:18.866
and get Mr. Perkins'
old chart.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.467
If you can't find that,

13:20.500 --> 13:24.037
Cardiology should have his last
EKG on file on the fifth floor.

13:24.071 --> 13:26.406
He's got anemia
and renal insufficiency

13:26.439 --> 13:28.876
so print out his BUN,
creatinine

13:28.909 --> 13:30.477
and CBC trends
for the last two years.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.979
Okay.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.613
Hey, there.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.348
Don't forget--

13:35.382 --> 13:37.450
dinner tonight, 8:00.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.552
Oh, they have a dress code,
so wear something nice.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.588
How nice?

13:41.621 --> 13:44.357
I'm wearing
my little black dress.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.625
( chuckling )

13:45.658 --> 13:47.260
I think I'm in.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.261
You think?

13:48.295 --> 13:49.462
No, no. I'm in.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.898
Hey.

13:50.898 --> 13:52.499
How come I wasn't invited
to this party?

13:52.532 --> 13:53.934
Hook up the thoraseal.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.568
Okay, I got it.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.271
Okay, what's next?

13:58.305 --> 14:00.273
Um...

14:00.307 --> 14:01.208
You want 0-silk?

14:01.241 --> 14:02.342
Yes. 0-silk.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.577
MALIK:
Girl in two's X rays.

14:04.611 --> 14:05.478
You better check it out.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.413
Not good.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.580
Who is it?

14:07.614 --> 14:09.382
LEWIS:
Tachypneic girl in two.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.517
Huge heart.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.253
Call Cards.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.454
She's in failure.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.064
I can't stop drooling.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.232
I'm out.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.466
A nurse will be with
you in one minute.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.538
Hey, what about
that sandwich?

14:31.571 --> 14:32.305
What about it?

14:32.339 --> 14:33.573
Where's Amanda?

14:33.606 --> 14:35.308
She's supposed
to relieve me at 1:00.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.210
Your nursing brethren are
all over at Dunkin Donuts

14:37.244 --> 14:38.678
plotting some kind of a coup.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.480
Hey, did you sign this?

14:40.513 --> 14:41.514
No.
Smart girl.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.350
Should have.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.218
I want everyone on this petition
in the lounge in five minutes.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.219
They staged a walkout.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.220
No, they did not.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.221
They're on a break.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.156
For over an hour?

14:49.189 --> 14:50.490
Well, page them.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.959
Anyone who's not back
in five minutes is fired.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.160
You can't fire nurses.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.627
I can if they walk
off the job.

14:54.661 --> 14:55.595
I'll go get them.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.332
Hey, you got a hook.
Suits you.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.968
Shut up.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.137
Nobody's called my name yet.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.538
They will.

15:05.572 --> 15:09.542
Would it help if I gave
a stool sample, too?

15:09.576 --> 15:10.677
No, just...

15:10.710 --> 15:11.678
Yeah.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.049
Are you a nurse?

15:16.083 --> 15:17.550
Check-in's at tria...

15:17.584 --> 15:18.585
What happened to you?

15:18.618 --> 15:19.586
Somebody shot me.

15:19.619 --> 15:20.587
Okay, all right.

15:20.620 --> 15:21.989
Okay, sit down, sit down.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.090
I need a gurney!

15:23.123 --> 15:25.225
What's your name?
What's your name?

15:25.258 --> 15:26.226
Bobby.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.427
Okay, Bobby.
Okay.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.428
Don't let me die.

15:28.461 --> 15:29.496
I won't.
I won't. I won't.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.032
Okay.

15:33.733 --> 15:34.701
Who shot you?

15:34.734 --> 15:36.136
I don't know.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.105
He got dumped
by a homeboy ambulance.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.406
You're going to have
to hold still, Bobby.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.141
We need to tube him.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.409
Well, get that line in
and I will.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.612
Uh-oh.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.414
Bobby? Bobby?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.382
Bobby, open your eyes.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.019
No radial pulse.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.086
Got a carotid,
but it's weak.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.221
Get him on the monitor.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.555
Get that blood up,
and page surgery.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.292
20 of Etomidate, 120 of sux.
Suction.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.561
BP: 64 systolic,
pulse is 60.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.363
Saline and a Mig of atropine.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.697
Penetrating trauma
with impending arrest.

16:04.731 --> 16:05.732
You gotta crack him.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.700
No, not yet. Tube.
Come on.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.369
I'm prepping the chest.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.075
All right, I'm in the hole.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.176
Bag him up, Abby.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.212
( alarm beeping )

16:19.246 --> 16:20.380
Where's Lewis?

16:21.548 --> 16:23.516
Abby, crash cart, now!

16:23.550 --> 16:25.385
Sorry, I had a hot MI.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.420
What are you doing, Pratt?

16:27.454 --> 16:29.356
Talk to Abby. I'm just trying
to put in a chest tube.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.058
He was talking to me
and now he's about to arrest.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.393
Good breath sounds,
airway secure, hypotensive.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.295
Okay, run the code, Pratt.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.464
What are you going to do,
crack him by yourself?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.366
Get Corday
and order some more 0-neg.

16:48.141 --> 16:51.344
Okay, Lisa, can you, uh,
follow my finger, please?

16:53.413 --> 16:55.315
Lisa, can you follow my finger?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.350
( whispers ):
Don't stare.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.689
Excuse me.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.394
Morris?

17:07.426 --> 17:10.396
Uh, work the kid up
in Curtain Two.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.800
Pressure's only 60 systolic.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.603
Vasculature is collapsed.

17:16.636 --> 17:17.770
Cut-down tray.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.439
Femoral cut down.

17:19.472 --> 17:20.473
Who are they?

17:20.507 --> 17:21.508
Med students.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.642
That makes three of epi.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.345
Good breath sounds with bagging.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.546
Hook up a cell saver.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.747
How much 0-neg?

17:27.780 --> 17:29.116
Four units.

17:29.116 --> 17:30.550
He's only got a faint carotid.

17:30.583 --> 17:31.718
Come on, man.
Stay with me.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.353
Another two units of blood.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.222
Let's follow
his chest tube output.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.456
PRATT:
Here he goes again.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.590
Hey, I have an idea.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.392
How about a thoracotomy?

17:39.426 --> 17:42.495
Wow, that is just so crazy,
Abby, it might work.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.731
There's only 300cc's
out the chest.

17:44.764 --> 17:45.732
( alarm beeps )

17:45.765 --> 17:46.733
V-fib.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.635
Charge to 200.
Look out!

17:48.668 --> 17:50.137
Prep for a thoracotomy.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.504
He's already prepped.

17:51.538 --> 17:52.539
Ten blade, now.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.480
First incision is
in the fourth intercostal space

18:00.513 --> 18:01.714
from the lateral sternum

18:01.748 --> 18:04.284
to the posterior axillary line.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.452
Clear.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.494
Hey, what's Carter mean
by "unfettered"?

18:14.527 --> 18:15.495
Well, it means...

18:15.528 --> 18:16.696
It means she's been dumped.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.198
You get rid
of those nurses?

18:18.231 --> 18:19.499
Yeah, they, uh...

18:19.532 --> 18:20.833
they went up
to Nursing Administration

18:20.867 --> 18:22.502
saying something
about hiring a hit man.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.771
Hell hath no fury
like an RN scorned.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.506
Whose patient is this?!

18:26.539 --> 18:27.440
She's mine.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.541
Well, get her back in bed

18:28.575 --> 18:29.709
and use restraints
if you have to.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.544
It's okay.
She's harmless.

18:31.578 --> 18:32.845
Hey, can you sign off
on a wound infection?

18:32.879 --> 18:35.182
No. Go away and
take her with you.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.316
No, seriously.
She's cool.

18:36.349 --> 18:37.817
I'm Nick Cooper, by the way.
Uh, Coop.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.452
I'm a new resident.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.621
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
realize who you were.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.190
Do me a favor
would you, Coop?

18:43.223 --> 18:44.691
Air Rescue's bringing
in a bad MVA.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.259
Will you go up on the roof
and wave in the chopper?

18:46.293 --> 18:47.660
And make sure you stand

18:47.694 --> 18:49.262
in the middle of
the landing pad,
so they see you.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.598
You're Rocket Romano.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.766
You were a surgeon--
used to be Chief of Staff.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.202
I still am a surgeon.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.836
Yeah? You got
scalpel attachments

18:56.869 --> 18:57.837
for that bad boy?

19:05.712 --> 19:06.679
I'm right-handed.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.915
Lucky.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.517
So, this guy's
ten days out of...

19:10.550 --> 19:12.419
Let's get a few things straight,
all right, nutmeat?

19:12.452 --> 19:14.721
One: we don't offer
remedial medicine here.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.324
Two: You don't talk to me.
I talk to you.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.326
Should I be writing this down?

19:19.359 --> 19:20.660
Stay out of my face!

19:30.937 --> 19:32.572
CORDAY:
30 again.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.641
Clear.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.444
LOCKHART:
Fine v-fib.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.612
LEWIS:
More like coarse asystole.

19:39.646 --> 19:40.613
Resuming compressions.

19:40.647 --> 19:41.614
Units five
and six are up.

19:41.648 --> 19:42.449
How long's it been?

19:42.482 --> 19:43.816
35 minutes.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.253
We should be able to shock him
into sinus.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.288
Hold CPR.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.589
There's nothing
to shock.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.693
High dose epi.
Might coarsen his rhythm.

19:53.726 --> 19:54.761
He's been down too long.

19:54.794 --> 19:55.595
He's young and healthy.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.530
With fatal wounds.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.898
His hilum and aorta
are cross-clamped.

19:58.931 --> 19:59.999
We've replaced his volume

20:00.032 --> 20:01.634
and maxed out
on atropine and epi.

20:01.668 --> 20:02.669
He walked in here.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.703
He was talking to me.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.738
That's it.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.977
Time of death: 13:36.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.683
Abby, can you try
and locate the family?

20:44.944 --> 20:46.446
I was coming down the ladder

20:46.479 --> 20:49.482
and I stepped on the cord
to my sander.

20:49.516 --> 20:50.750
I only fell about three feet,

20:50.783 --> 20:52.452
but I twisted my ankle
pretty good

20:52.485 --> 20:54.321
and my collarbone's killing me.

20:54.354 --> 20:54.854
Well, let's
take a look.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.423
Okay.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.391
I heard about your run-in
with Dr. Romano.

20:58.425 --> 20:59.892
Someone should
have warned you.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.060
He's quite a character.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.929
That's one word for him.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.497
( groans )

21:04.531 --> 21:05.665
What were you sanding?

21:05.698 --> 21:06.833
The hull of a boat.

21:06.866 --> 21:07.834
Fiberglass?

21:07.867 --> 21:08.835
Yeah.

21:08.868 --> 21:12.071
( coughing )

21:12.104 --> 21:13.440
Are you all right?

21:14.941 --> 21:17.510
Hey, Coop, you ready
to present some cases?

21:17.544 --> 21:18.911
His asthma's
acting up.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.047
All right, give him
an albuterol treatment.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.449
Then come find me.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.483
We have to clear
this board.

21:23.516 --> 21:24.417
( coughing violently )

21:24.451 --> 21:25.752
So, what's the story?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.654
Call respiratory
to set up nitric oxide,

21:27.687 --> 21:28.855
give her more Lasix

21:28.888 --> 21:30.089
and start an
isoproteronol drip.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.624
What?

21:31.658 --> 21:33.360
She has primary
pulmonary hypertension.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.527
You're kidding.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.896
Can you even diagnose
PPHN from an echo?

21:36.929 --> 21:38.598
If you know what
to look for.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.567
We'll cath her in the lab
to be a hundred percent.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.802
Tough break.
Seemed like a nice kid.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.372
Yeah.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.577
( sighs )

21:50.610 --> 21:52.412
Hennessy in Exam Three
needs a foley and an IV.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.914
CBC and chem panel
on Gininni in Curtain Four

21:54.947 --> 21:57.550
and scalp lac kid in the
Suture Room needs a setup.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.952
What, am I the only
nurse working today?

21:59.986 --> 22:01.454
Close-- Romano fired six.

22:01.488 --> 22:05.425
Oh, so that leaves four of us
for 35 patients.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.793
Looks like you
dodged a bullet.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.828
Hey, I'm sorry about the
thoracotomy on that kid.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.730
Didn't seem to make
a difference.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.131
Maybe if we'd
done it sooner.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.600
You reach the parents?

22:13.633 --> 22:14.133
No.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.602
Oh.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.504
Hey, you know,
for what it's worth--

22:17.537 --> 22:19.138
I think it's Carter's loss.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.740
What?

22:20.773 --> 22:22.475
Do you know where
my parents are?

22:22.509 --> 22:24.511
They went to talk
to the doctor.

22:24.544 --> 22:26.513
They said they'd
only be a few minutes,

22:26.546 --> 22:27.780
but that was a while ago.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.482
Uh, why don't you
hop back into bed

22:29.516 --> 22:30.650
and I'll find them
for you, okay?

22:30.683 --> 22:31.951
Okay.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.152
MORRIS:
I think he's getting
even tighter.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.153
( faintly ):
Epi.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.154
RASGOTRA:
Try not to talk.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.789
Slow, deep breaths.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.425
( faintly ):
Epi. Epi.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.659
Sub-Q epinephrine?

22:41.561 --> 22:43.596
Uh... point three.

22:43.630 --> 22:46.433
His nebulizer's dry.

22:46.433 --> 22:49.636
Okay, we'll try five
of albuterol this time.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.507
Push it.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.612
Little stick here, Coop.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.856
Too much. Too much.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.824
We gave you point three.

23:11.858 --> 23:12.859
You said push it all.

23:14.461 --> 23:15.895
You gave one milligram?

23:15.928 --> 23:17.864
That's over three
times the dose.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.065
I'll get an attending.

23:19.098 --> 23:21.701
No, no, no.
He can handle it.

23:21.734 --> 23:22.669
( alarm beeps )

23:22.702 --> 23:24.036
V-tach.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.638
Crash cart.

23:25.672 --> 23:26.473
What the hell happened?

23:26.506 --> 23:27.707
Too much epi.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.108
Has he got a pulse?
Can you hear me, Coop?

23:30.543 --> 23:31.744
Charge to 300.
No, no, no, no!

23:31.778 --> 23:32.979
It's stable v-tach.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.146
He only needs 50.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.615
Do you want
some Valium first?

23:35.648 --> 23:36.749
This could be a little
uncomfortable.

23:36.783 --> 23:37.917
Just do it.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.185
Charged to 50
for synch cardioversion.

23:39.218 --> 23:40.520
Clear.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.188
( yells ):
Ah, jeez!

23:42.221 --> 23:43.222
V-tach.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.557
Let's try 100.

23:44.591 --> 23:45.558
Valium.
Charged.

23:45.592 --> 23:46.626
Valium.

23:46.659 --> 23:47.760
Clear.

23:47.794 --> 23:49.962
( yells )

23:51.764 --> 23:52.832
( panting )

23:52.865 --> 23:54.033
Okay.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.703
Congratulations.

23:56.736 --> 24:01.107
You just saved
your first resident.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.117
You can't just
sit here.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.519
The union steward said
to stay the entire shift.

24:12.552 --> 24:13.853
But we're getting slammed.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.822
I mean,
we'll work it all out tomorrow.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.023
I'm sorry, Abby.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.157
But think about
how you're going to feel

24:18.190 --> 24:19.659
ten years from now

24:19.692 --> 24:21.127
when they start replacing you

24:21.160 --> 24:22.562
with minimum-wage grads
right out of nursing school.

24:22.595 --> 24:25.031
MALIK:
Abby,

24:25.064 --> 24:25.865
Lewis is yelling for you.

24:28.968 --> 24:29.936
Are you nurses?

24:29.969 --> 24:30.970
No.
No.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.672
How come
you're still working?

24:32.705 --> 24:35.007
I'm an LVN. They don't
get no cheaper than me.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.176
Pratt needs a chaperone
for a pelvic in Three.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.111
Okay, if you could cath
the little boy in Four.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.112
Done deal.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.247
You still with us?

24:42.982 --> 24:45.117
Okay, I also have a guy in Two
that needs something.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.152
I can't read it.

24:46.185 --> 24:46.919
What's that say,
"nipple lips"?

24:46.953 --> 24:48.120
Oh, all right.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.989
I got a resident who
needs a holding help

24:50.022 --> 24:52.124
for a spinal tap on
the dirty, old man
in Exam Three.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.125
He died.

24:53.159 --> 24:53.826
For real?

24:53.860 --> 24:54.861
Real dead.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.162
Do you think
there's any chance

24:56.195 --> 24:57.196
you could cover for me
for, like, five minutes

24:57.229 --> 24:58.698
so I could run upstairs?

24:58.731 --> 24:59.866
I got to deal with the whole
nursing situation.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.634
I haven't had a chance
to see Luka yet.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.235
You're joking.
I haven't stopped
for six hours.

25:03.269 --> 25:04.937
I had to use a
patient's urinal, Abby.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.238
And that Carter letter.
Look, I'm sorry.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.640
I know that was
pretty harsh.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.810
Okay. How did you hear
about this letter?

25:10.843 --> 25:11.978
Jerry.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.112
Jerry.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.213
Excuse me,

25:14.246 --> 25:15.582
Dr. Romano,

25:15.582 --> 25:16.716
if we don't get some help
down here,

25:16.749 --> 25:17.584
the patients are going
to start dying.

25:17.617 --> 25:18.818
We pulled the registry.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.086
Someone from the service
should be here

25:20.119 --> 25:21.153
within a couple of hours.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.155
Uh, Edna's down
from Geriatrics.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.293
Edna?

25:29.896 --> 25:33.165
Hey, excuse me,
excuse me. Hi.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.167
There is a drunk
in Exam Four

25:35.201 --> 25:37.069
that needs two
more of Ativan.

25:37.103 --> 25:39.271
I'm sorry, dear.
He's a putz.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.340
Who, the drunk?

25:41.373 --> 25:42.909
That Carter boy.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.878
Huh! It's too bad
you didn't dump him first!

25:45.912 --> 25:47.179
You've gotta be kidding me.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.849
The big man, he let me
read the letter. Ha-ha!

25:51.050 --> 25:52.218
Oh, Abby, the
guy in Three

25:52.251 --> 25:54.186
needs another bolus
and an emesis basin.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.088
And you call the lab
and ask why it's
taking over two hours

25:56.122 --> 25:57.156
to get a set
of electrolytes.

25:57.189 --> 25:58.625
Malik can do some of this.

25:58.658 --> 25:59.992
Hey!

26:00.026 --> 26:02.929
Okay, did you hear
about my letter?

26:02.962 --> 26:04.330
What letter?
Good.

26:04.363 --> 26:07.233
Oh, yeah, I need a phenytoin
level on my seizure guy,

26:07.266 --> 26:09.936
and your girl in Exam Two
needs 20 of Lasix, IV.

26:09.969 --> 26:11.303
Oh, Elle.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.105
I told her I was going
to find her parents.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.641
How's she doing?

26:14.641 --> 26:16.676
Well, she has
primary pulmonary hypertension.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.344
Won't live to see
her 21st birthday.

26:18.377 --> 26:19.646
Other than that,
she's fine.

26:19.646 --> 26:21.113
Are you sure?

26:21.147 --> 26:23.315
98%. They won't be certain
until after the cath on Monday.

26:23.349 --> 26:24.984
And her parents
don't want her to know

26:25.017 --> 26:26.252
until after the tests.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.720
They're not going to
tell her for three days?

26:27.754 --> 26:28.888
I know, it's awkward.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.322
It's not awkward,
it's stupid.

26:30.356 --> 26:32.291
I mean, she already
senses something's wrong.

26:32.324 --> 26:33.926
She deserves to
know the truth.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.361
Well, after the cath,
she'll know,

26:35.394 --> 26:37.229
and then it'll all be
downhill from there.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.732
Just stay out of it.
It's the parents' decision.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.067
Excuse me.

26:41.100 --> 26:41.968
Hi, I'm sorry.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.670
We got turned around.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.171
We were supposed to be going
to the children's ward

26:45.204 --> 26:46.405
to visit a classmate.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.274
Okay, uh, go back
to the elevator.

26:48.307 --> 26:50.910
Go up to the third floor,
take a left...

26:50.943 --> 26:53.846
You know what?
I'll show you.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.247
Thanks.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.215
Are you a nurse?

26:56.248 --> 26:57.750
Yes, I am a nurse.

26:57.784 --> 27:00.252
Who here wants to be a nurse?

27:02.321 --> 27:04.891
Hey, you know boys
can be nurses, too.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.926
I want to be a doctor.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.128
CHILDREN:
Me, too! Me, too!

27:09.161 --> 27:10.930
Robert!

27:10.963 --> 27:12.932
Well, to what do we
owe this royal visit?

27:12.965 --> 27:14.166
Do you have any idea
who that was

27:14.200 --> 27:15.234
in my office
this morning?

27:15.267 --> 27:16.402
Well, let me see,
do I care? No.

27:16.435 --> 27:17.837
That was totally
inappropriate.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.739
Oh, yeah?
I'll tell you

27:19.772 --> 27:21.373
what's inappropriate, Kerry.
( crutch clunks on floor )

27:21.407 --> 27:22.842
This hospital boning
me with a prosthesis

27:22.875 --> 27:24.744
that has a limited
functional field.

27:24.777 --> 27:26.278
I'll develop
peripheral neuropathy,
overuse syndrome...

27:26.312 --> 27:27.346
Did you fire
six nurses today?

27:27.379 --> 27:28.815
Yes, as a matter of fact

27:28.848 --> 27:30.216
it was the only
good part of my day.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.784
How'd you like me to fire you?

27:31.818 --> 27:33.753
Well, I've got a, uh,
handicap, remember?

27:33.786 --> 27:36.088
Yes. Somehow I don't think
that'd be an issue.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.456
Uh, you guys have
an audience.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.926
You fire anyone else,
even a candy striper,

27:39.959 --> 27:41.193
and you're going with them.

27:41.227 --> 27:44.130
Consider this
an official reprimand.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.733
You are one
grade "A" bitch!

27:48.100 --> 27:49.301
You know that, Kerry?

27:52.471 --> 27:54.006
You know, Robert,
I'm your boss,

27:54.040 --> 27:55.074
and as long as I am,

27:55.107 --> 27:56.108
you're my bitch.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.309
Now get your ass
back to work.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.354
Fecal impaction in Four

28:08.387 --> 28:09.989
needs some good
old-fashioned
finger-digging.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.157
Enjoy.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.026
Jerry!

28:14.060 --> 28:16.162
Can you show them how to get
to the Pedes playroom?

28:16.195 --> 28:17.163
Yep.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.330
Thank you.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.866
What is that?

28:19.899 --> 28:21.901
Uh, this is human blood.

28:21.934 --> 28:24.036
( screaming )

28:31.443 --> 28:32.779
Hi, Elle.

28:32.779 --> 28:34.413
Feeling any better?

28:34.446 --> 28:35.815
Yeah.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.416
I can finally take
a deep breath.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.385
That's good.

28:39.418 --> 28:42.321
They had a heart doctor
come see me.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.090
Mm-hmm.

28:44.123 --> 28:46.926
Why?

28:46.959 --> 28:50.362
I thought it was my lungs,
not my heart.

28:52.799 --> 28:54.266
Well, your heart...

28:56.302 --> 28:59.105
Your heart and your lungs
are connected,

28:59.138 --> 29:01.908
so it only makes sense
that, um,

29:01.941 --> 29:05.945
cardiology would come
and take a look at you.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.447
I'm sure Dr. Lewis
was just being thorough.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.917
So, was it okay?

29:10.950 --> 29:13.419
My heart?

29:13.452 --> 29:16.823
My parents were
acting a little weird.

29:18.357 --> 29:21.493
Well... all parents
are a little weird, right?

29:26.365 --> 29:28.334
I'm sure they just want you
to get better.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.036
I'm going to go
find Dr. Lewis

29:30.069 --> 29:32.905
and see if she's
heard anything, okay?

29:39.912 --> 29:42.514
( sighs )

29:46.585 --> 29:47.920
Uh, hey.

29:47.954 --> 29:48.921
Hey.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.156
Um, these are my parents.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.258
Mom? Dad?
This is Greg.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.060
PRATT:
Hey, how you doing?

29:54.093 --> 29:55.261
Nice to meet you.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.429
Um, they were
downtown shopping.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.065
Really?

29:59.098 --> 30:01.133
And, um, now they want
to join us for dinner.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.902
I hope you don't mind.

30:02.935 --> 30:03.903
Come on.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.071
( chuckles )

30:05.104 --> 30:06.973
It's-it's okay.
How you doing?

30:07.006 --> 30:08.207
Nice to see you.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.942
Sit down.

30:09.976 --> 30:12.244
Thank you.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.513
( sighs )

30:19.418 --> 30:21.187
Much better.
The medicine's working.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.422
Dr. Lewis, I heard
there was a PPHN in here.

30:23.455 --> 30:26.592
Cardiology said I should
listen for a tricuspid
regurge murmur.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.260
A what?
Is that what I have?

30:28.294 --> 30:29.962
There's something wrong
with my heart?

30:29.996 --> 30:31.597
This is not a good
teaching case, Neela.

30:31.630 --> 30:32.965
Come with me.

30:32.999 --> 30:34.266
ELLE:
No, I-I want
her to stay.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.434
I want to know

30:35.467 --> 30:37.103
what's wrong with me.

30:37.136 --> 30:40.106
Okay, I'll be right back,
all right?

30:40.139 --> 30:42.274
I've never seen
a PPHN before.

30:42.308 --> 30:44.443
She's not a PPHN.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.212
She's a girl who's
about to find out

30:46.245 --> 30:48.347
she's going to die
a slow, horrible death.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.116
She hasn't been told yet?

30:50.149 --> 30:51.450
There are extenuating
circumstances

30:51.483 --> 30:53.019
which you don't know about...
Excuse me.

30:53.052 --> 30:55.922
What are you doing?

30:55.955 --> 30:58.891
He-he wasn't eating it.

30:58.925 --> 31:00.960
That doesn't mean
you get to.

31:00.993 --> 31:03.629
What's his story?

31:03.662 --> 31:04.596
Um...

31:04.630 --> 31:06.132
Forest Herman.

31:06.165 --> 31:09.601
Just snoozing off pain meds
for lower back pain.

31:09.635 --> 31:12.304
Mr. Herman, I'm Do...

31:12.338 --> 31:14.473
Mr. Herman?

31:14.506 --> 31:16.142
Tell me he's sleeping.

31:16.175 --> 31:17.643
Not unless he's
taking a dirt nap.

31:17.676 --> 31:19.145
Wait, I feel a pulse.

31:19.178 --> 31:20.512
It's weak.
Get a crash cart!

31:21.981 --> 31:23.149
Bag him.
What'd you give him?

31:23.182 --> 31:26.485
Just Demerol for back pain.

31:26.518 --> 31:29.621
Somebody page Corday.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.190
( sighs )

31:31.223 --> 31:33.592
Okay, wh-what did I do?
What did I miss?

31:33.625 --> 31:35.294
While you were stealing
his tuna fish,

31:35.327 --> 31:38.664
he was bleeding out
from a triple-A.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.134
He's drifting down.
You want more blood?

31:42.168 --> 31:43.235
Yep. Hang it.

31:43.269 --> 31:44.570
This man needs vascular
right now.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.005
If we can get
his pressure up,

31:46.038 --> 31:47.373
they can do
an endovascular procedure.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.241
He probably won't survive
an open wound.

31:49.275 --> 31:52.044
I've paged them.
They were unimpressed.

31:52.078 --> 31:54.380
Right. Let's page
Dr. Dorset again.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.383
Tell him Dr. Corday
needs him. Badly.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.593
I tried to get you a room
with a fireplace by the pool,

32:07.626 --> 32:10.229
but the guys from Coldplay
rented out the whole top floor

32:10.262 --> 32:11.397
for a party.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.299
I can walk.

32:13.332 --> 32:16.468
I know, but, uh,
hospital policy says

32:16.502 --> 32:19.638
I have to do the driving.

32:19.671 --> 32:21.007
Where are your parents?

32:21.007 --> 32:23.009
They disappear
every half hour.

32:23.042 --> 32:26.512
My mom pretends they're
making phone calls for work,

32:26.545 --> 32:30.149
but when they come back,
I can tell she's been crying.

32:30.182 --> 32:35.021
So, either
the stock market crashed...

32:35.054 --> 32:37.023
or there's something
really wrong with me,

32:37.056 --> 32:38.624
and no one's willing
to talk about it.

32:38.657 --> 32:41.493
( ragged breathing )

32:41.527 --> 32:44.096
So, what,
am I dying?

32:44.130 --> 32:46.265
Do I have cancer or something?

32:50.369 --> 32:56.108
Okay, Elle, the doctors still
have some more tests to do,

32:56.142 --> 32:58.110
but so far...

32:58.144 --> 32:59.645
Abby, I need
to talk to you.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.147
We're on our way upstairs.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.314
Oh, okay.
Hey, Malik,

33:02.348 --> 33:04.516
can you wheel Elle
to, uh, Three South?

33:04.550 --> 33:05.684
Yeah.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.053
I need, uh, help
with the code.

33:15.561 --> 33:16.528
This is wrong.

33:16.562 --> 33:17.729
You know it.

33:17.763 --> 33:19.431
We're teaching her
not to trust us

33:19.465 --> 33:21.767
exactly at the time she should
be trusting us the most.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.435
Abby, what is wrong
with you today?

33:23.469 --> 33:25.437
You practically start
a thoracotomy on your own,

33:25.471 --> 33:26.705
and now you're talking
to my patients

33:26.738 --> 33:27.706
when I asked you not to.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.508
Well, somebody should.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.177
It's not your call.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.678
You're not her doctor;
you're her nurse,

33:32.711 --> 33:36.448
so when I ask you
not to do something,
don't do it.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.793
Mind if I watch?

33:47.826 --> 33:49.195
You should be
at home in bed.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.729
ABBY:
Unit 6 type specific is up.

33:50.762 --> 33:52.498
Pressure's down to 80/40.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.100
Shouldn't we start pressors?

33:54.100 --> 33:55.334
You really do want
to kill this guy.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.635
He's not stable.

33:56.668 --> 33:58.404
He was, but your service
refused to come down.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.539
Those bastards hate
to leave the hot tub.

34:00.572 --> 34:01.807
You... grab some Betadine,

34:01.840 --> 34:03.242
scrub this guy
like a sweet potato.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.411
Uh... ectopy.

34:05.444 --> 34:06.812
Kick that tray
over here.

34:06.845 --> 34:08.813
You sure you don't want
to do this upstairs?

34:08.847 --> 34:11.617
Love to. You didn't leave enough
gas in him to get me there.

34:11.650 --> 34:12.818
MORRIS:
Scrubbed.

34:12.851 --> 34:14.520
Nicely done. Maybe
you can detail

34:14.553 --> 34:15.754
my Jag after work.

34:15.786 --> 34:17.589
Ten blade.
Drape this area

34:17.623 --> 34:18.623
here and here.

34:18.657 --> 34:19.725
Suction to Lewis.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.527
Can we try
a little more teaching,

34:21.560 --> 34:23.295
a little less stand-up?

34:23.329 --> 34:25.197
Are you serious?
My name's on the chart.

34:25.231 --> 34:26.498
Well, it's like we say upstairs:

34:26.532 --> 34:27.733
"What happens in the ER
stays in the ER."

34:27.766 --> 34:28.667
Gee, thanks.

34:28.699 --> 34:29.835
ABBY:
His BP's still 50.

34:29.868 --> 34:31.503
Cover your eyes, kids.

34:31.536 --> 34:33.839
This is going to be
some bad-ass juju.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.741
Midline transperitoneal
incision.

34:38.177 --> 34:41.647
There. Pull down a bit,
Dr. Corday.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.681
You know, it really
is like music

34:43.715 --> 34:45.717
when we work together.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.155
Uh-oh.

34:52.391 --> 34:54.693
You boys remember
the Law of Laplace?

34:57.263 --> 34:59.531
Stress on the arterial wall

34:59.565 --> 35:02.534
is pressure times radius,
divided by wall thickness?

35:02.568 --> 35:04.236
You two have just been
nurse-slapped.

35:04.270 --> 35:06.372
You know what it means?

35:06.405 --> 35:08.207
It means this man's
about to die.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.309
Anyone can rip
a man's heart out...

35:10.342 --> 35:12.544
but fixing it without looking--

35:12.578 --> 35:13.712
that's why I get

35:13.745 --> 35:16.482
the big money
and all the hot chicks.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.450
Right-angled retractor.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.352
CORDAY:
Is this where I get
to make a joke

35:20.386 --> 35:22.554
about this man
bleeding to death?

35:22.588 --> 35:24.190
Only if you're qualified.

35:24.223 --> 35:27.493
Oh, I've got the supraceliac
aorta in my hand,

35:27.526 --> 35:28.560
which means we have
proximal control.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.496
Don't try this at home.

35:30.529 --> 35:32.431
Or anywhere near
this hospital.

35:32.464 --> 35:33.632
You need a clamp?

35:33.665 --> 35:35.234
No, I think
it's best if I pull

35:35.267 --> 35:36.735
a Dutch boy and keep
my finger in it.
Let's roll.

35:36.768 --> 35:39.471
( panting )

35:45.611 --> 35:47.646
MORRIS:
How wicked was that?

35:47.679 --> 35:49.615
Guy's got balls the
size of my head.

35:51.283 --> 35:52.584
( grunts ):
Oops.

35:52.618 --> 35:53.752
I want the blue one.

35:53.785 --> 35:54.920
Well, hey,
you know what?

35:54.953 --> 35:56.455
A medical student
was crushed to death

35:56.488 --> 35:57.923
working on this
computer last year.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.625
I can believe it.

35:59.658 --> 36:00.759
You save any lives today?

36:00.792 --> 36:01.760
Nope.

36:01.793 --> 36:02.928
She saved one.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.763
Hey, I'm Nick Cooper.

36:04.796 --> 36:05.931
My friends call me Coop.

36:05.964 --> 36:07.633
Michael Gallant.
Good to meet you.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.468
So, did I miss
anything good?

36:09.501 --> 36:10.936
Uh, yeah.
Dr. Kovac is back.

36:10.969 --> 36:12.938
He's upstairs.
He's doing better.

36:12.971 --> 36:15.607
Abby got a "Dear John"
letter from Carter.

36:15.641 --> 36:16.608
And she gave it to you?

36:16.642 --> 36:17.543
Not exactly.

36:17.576 --> 36:18.644
What's it say?

36:18.677 --> 36:20.479
NEELA:
I imagine it's private.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.314
Yeah, you're probably right.
What's it say?

36:22.348 --> 36:26.318
( clears throat ):
"Dear Abby..."

36:26.352 --> 36:28.620
Has anybody not read
this letter?

36:28.654 --> 36:30.656
I haven't.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.658
What, you pulled this
out of the trash?

36:32.691 --> 36:33.659
I...

36:33.692 --> 36:34.960
You guys are pathetic.

36:37.829 --> 36:39.965
You're not the
only one who got
a letter today.

36:39.998 --> 36:41.967
We all got 90-day
suspensions.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.671
I hate my job!

36:45.704 --> 36:48.974
Don't worry, dear.
It'll get better.

36:50.342 --> 36:51.677
LIN:
I hope you don't
mind, Greg,

36:51.710 --> 36:53.512
but we went ahead and
ordered some things

36:53.545 --> 36:54.780
that's not on the menu.

36:54.813 --> 36:57.283
Oh, no, this is okay.
It looks good.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.524
Sorry.

37:05.557 --> 37:06.692
LIN:
So, Greg,

37:06.725 --> 37:08.727
what do you parents do?

37:08.760 --> 37:11.930
Um, well, my mom passed
away when I was 12,

37:11.963 --> 37:15.434
and my father and I
never kept in touch.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.002
Well, that's unfortunate.

37:17.035 --> 37:19.705
Family is such a valuable part
of one's life.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.740
It's important to have roots.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.609
LIN:
Jing-Mei is going
to China with us.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.644
She's going to rediscover

37:25.677 --> 37:26.645
her ancestry.

37:26.678 --> 37:29.381
Uh, no, I'm not, Mom.

37:29.415 --> 37:31.016
We talked about this.

37:31.049 --> 37:33.385
It's difficult to know
where you're going

37:33.419 --> 37:34.986
if you don't know
where you came from.

37:35.020 --> 37:36.655
What's that? Confucius?

37:37.956 --> 37:39.758
Common sense.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.963
Lizzie, burning
the midnight oil?

37:44.996 --> 37:47.733
Not if I can help it.

37:47.766 --> 37:48.900
How are you doing?

37:48.934 --> 37:50.802
Very well, thanks.

37:50.836 --> 37:53.605
DORSET:
So, is this where all
the cool kids hang out?

37:53.639 --> 37:54.906
Not if we can help it.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.608
How's our triple-A?

37:56.642 --> 37:57.909
Not dead yet.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.611
Well, that's
encouraging.

37:59.645 --> 38:02.614
Thank you for coming
down so quickly.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.583
And...?

38:04.616 --> 38:06.084
And what?

38:06.117 --> 38:10.622
This is where you say,
"I owe you one."

38:12.624 --> 38:14.460
What do you want?

38:14.493 --> 38:16.628
Foot rub.

38:16.662 --> 38:20.632
I'll, uh...
I'll settle for coffee.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.401
I have to be home
in an hour,

38:22.434 --> 38:23.669
and there's
nothing fancy--

38:23.702 --> 38:25.604
no coconut-frosted
double javaccinos

38:25.637 --> 38:27.639
or anything like that.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.942
Oh, all right.

38:30.976 --> 38:31.943
Good night, Robert.

38:31.977 --> 38:32.944
Elizabeth.

39:21.727 --> 39:23.562
( screams )

39:27.733 --> 39:29.167
( horn honks )

39:29.200 --> 39:30.869
Whoo!
( laughing )

39:30.902 --> 39:33.004
Okay, okay,
how bad was that?

39:33.038 --> 39:35.073
What, the jellyfish
or the ambush?

39:35.106 --> 39:36.442
I'm so sorry.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.043
You know, they
caught me off guard.

39:38.076 --> 39:40.712
Mm-hmm.
You know, if it's
any consolation,

39:40.746 --> 39:41.880
they didn't hate you.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.882
Oh, is that
what they were saying?

39:43.915 --> 39:45.551
They're just old-fashioned.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.819
Taxi! Meaning?

39:47.853 --> 39:52.090
Meaning they want me
to be with someone
more traditional.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.793
You know, all that talk
about going to China?

39:54.826 --> 39:56.962
They just want to
find me a husband.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.664
Well, just tell them
to relax, all right?

39:58.697 --> 39:59.765
It's not like
we're getting married.

39:59.798 --> 40:01.767
Hey, taxi!

40:01.800 --> 40:03.101
Come on.

40:03.134 --> 40:05.504
( sighs )

40:05.537 --> 40:07.873
What?

40:10.509 --> 40:11.843
What are we doing?

40:13.144 --> 40:14.546
You're kidding, right?

40:14.580 --> 40:16.615
We're... we're dating,
you know?

40:16.648 --> 40:17.949
We're having fun.

40:17.983 --> 40:20.018
Neither one of us is ready
to settle down, right?

40:22.053 --> 40:23.789
Right.

40:25.491 --> 40:26.758
What, did I say something?

40:26.792 --> 40:27.759
Nope.

40:28.827 --> 40:29.695
Then why are you mad?

40:29.728 --> 40:31.563
I'm not mad.

40:31.597 --> 40:33.765
I'm sure you'll find yourself
a new bang buddy.

40:33.799 --> 40:35.801
Good night.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.711
( moaning )

40:49.147 --> 40:51.817
( panting )

40:53.519 --> 40:56.822
Thank God I got
you a decaf.

40:57.856 --> 41:01.627
( laughing and moaning )

41:05.163 --> 41:07.533
( sighs )

41:08.734 --> 41:10.536
He left.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.072
What are you doing?

41:14.105 --> 41:16.975
Ah, I needed to stretch
my legs.

41:17.008 --> 41:19.745
It's good to see you.

41:19.778 --> 41:22.748
Look great.

41:22.781 --> 41:25.751
You look... like hell.

41:25.784 --> 41:27.919
Too much partying
on the plane.

41:33.024 --> 41:34.159
So?

41:34.192 --> 41:35.894
So...

41:35.927 --> 41:38.664
So, I met Gillian.

41:39.865 --> 41:42.768
She seems...
Yeah, she is.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.938
Must be nice having
your own private nurse.

41:48.874 --> 41:50.041
She give you your letter?

41:51.643 --> 41:52.844
( clears throat ):
Did you read it?

41:54.345 --> 41:55.647
No.

41:55.681 --> 41:57.182
Well, you're the only one.

42:00.185 --> 42:03.154
I think he wanted to try
and explain why he stayed.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.692
He saved my life.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.696
It's different over there.

42:10.729 --> 42:13.999
Changes you.

42:14.032 --> 42:17.168
I think Carter
found himself.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.873
I didn't know he was missing.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.342
He's going to be okay.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.744
I don't want to talk
about Carter anymore.

42:27.145 --> 42:30.115
I think it was doomed
from the start.

42:30.148 --> 42:33.752
I'm glad one of us had
the courage to put it
out of its misery.

42:38.123 --> 42:41.259
It feels strange to be here.

42:41.292 --> 42:43.695
I think maybe I've changed, too.

42:45.130 --> 42:47.165
Well, change is good, right?

42:48.233 --> 42:50.235
I think I'm way overdue.

42:54.305 --> 42:57.142
I hope he hasn't talked you
into helping him escape.

42:57.175 --> 42:58.944
Nope.

42:58.977 --> 43:01.847
You need to take these
and get back in bed.

43:03.181 --> 43:04.716
You're still warm.

43:06.818 --> 43:08.687
I'll-I'll stop by
tomorrow.

43:08.720 --> 43:10.321
Okay.

43:10.355 --> 43:11.723
Great.

43:11.757 --> 43:14.192
It was really nice
to finally meet you.

43:14.225 --> 43:16.294
You, too.

43:16.327 --> 43:17.829
I'm glad you're back.

43:21.667 --> 43:23.969
How you doing, huh?
