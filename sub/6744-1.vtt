05:16.425 --> 05:20.862
Your move: bishop to knight four.

05:20.930 --> 05:24.127
My move: knight to rook three.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.135
Poor baby, you're startin'
to lose it, aren't you?

05:33.709 --> 05:36.143
Your move: king to rook one.

05:36.212 --> 05:39.307
My move: rook to knight six.

05:39.382 --> 05:43.113
Checkmate. Checkmate.

05:46.389 --> 05:49.153
You cheatin' bitch.

06:52.456 --> 06:55.220
Childs, what's he doin'?

06:55.293 --> 06:57.488
Circling the camp.

06:57.562 --> 06:59.496
Who is he?

06:59.564 --> 07:02.931
Said "Norge" or something
on the side. It's Norwegian.

09:07.594 --> 09:09.528
George, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

09:09.596 --> 09:11.530
Are you? Yeah. What's going on there?

09:34.022 --> 09:35.956
Watch it.

09:56.044 --> 09:57.978
Easy.

10:00.715 --> 10:05.311
Easy, easy, easy. Yes.

10:17.566 --> 10:20.501
First goddamn week of winter.

10:30.379 --> 10:35.112
Oh, come on. Four stitches. Barely grazed ya.

10:35.184 --> 10:38.017
What were they doin' flyin' that low,

10:38.087 --> 10:40.180
shooting at a dog, at us?

10:40.256 --> 10:42.656
Mmm, stir-crazy.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.125
Cabin fever. Who knows?

10:45.194 --> 10:49.358
U.S. Number 31, calling
McMurdo. Come in. Over.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.035
U.S. Number 31, calling McMurdo.

10:54.104 --> 10:56.038
Urgent. Come in. Over.

10:56.106 --> 10:59.769
Great.

10:59.843 --> 11:02.334
Come on, come on. Nobody!

11:02.412 --> 11:04.346
Nobody. Get a hold of somebody.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.473
Get a hold of anybody.
We gotta report this mess.

11:06.550 --> 11:10.077
Look, I haven't been able
to reach shit in two weeks.

11:10.153 --> 11:13.145
I doubt if anybody's talked to
anybody on this entire continent,

11:13.223 --> 11:16.989
and you want me to reach somebody!

11:26.303 --> 11:29.033
Maybe we're at war with Norway.

11:32.909 --> 11:35.844
I was wonderin' when the El Capitan...

11:35.912 --> 11:38.575
was gonna get a chance to use his popgun.

11:42.653 --> 11:46.145
How long've they been stationed
there? It says here only eight weeks.

11:46.224 --> 11:49.159
Well, that's not long enough for
guys to go bonkers. Bullshit, bwana.

11:49.227 --> 11:52.685
Five minutes is enough to put a
man over down here. Damn straight.

11:52.763 --> 11:56.995
I mean, look at Palmer. He been
the way he is since the first day.

11:57.068 --> 11:59.002
How many in their party?

11:59.070 --> 12:02.631
They started with ten. There'd be
eight others left. How do we know?

12:02.707 --> 12:04.641
Guys as crazy as that could have done...

12:04.709 --> 12:06.734
a lot of damage to their
own before they got to us.

12:06.811 --> 12:09.302
Nothing we can do about that.
Yes there is. I wanna go up.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.314
In this weather? Bennings?

12:11.382 --> 12:13.714
Winds are gonna let up a
tad next couple of hours.

12:13.784 --> 12:15.718
A tad?

12:15.786 --> 12:17.720
Can't condone it much myself,

12:17.788 --> 12:19.881
but it is a short haul.

12:19.957 --> 12:22.791
An hour there, an hour back.

12:22.861 --> 12:26.228
Shit, Doc, I'll give
you the lift. No problem.

12:26.298 --> 12:30.359
Forget it, Palmer. Hey, thanks
for thinking about it though.

12:34.239 --> 12:36.764
Loaded with kerosene. I count 15 cans.

12:36.842 --> 12:40.073
MacReady! Mac, get your gear on!

12:51.323 --> 12:53.257
Mac, it may not clear up for a week. Yeah.

12:53.325 --> 12:55.691
We're the closest ones to
'em. It's all right by me, Doc.

12:55.761 --> 12:59.959
I'm just lettin' you know we're takin'
a chance. Quit the griping, MacReady.

13:00.032 --> 13:02.466
Those clouds keep movin' over the
sun, we're gonna get a whiteout.

13:02.534 --> 13:05.401
We get caught in that, you can
scratch one doctor and one pilot.

13:05.470 --> 13:09.134
This is real thin. It'll
clear as soon as you get up.

13:10.643 --> 13:14.079
It's up to you, Mac. If you
don't wanna fly, we don't fly.

13:15.648 --> 13:18.242
You really wanna save those
crazy Swedes, huh? Norwegians.

13:18.318 --> 13:20.252
Which way, Doc? Southwest.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.584
You're gonna have to read the map.

13:29.929 --> 13:34.229
Mac's really taking it up, huh?

13:34.300 --> 13:36.234
He knows what he's doin'.

14:38.233 --> 14:40.326
Nauls, will you turn that crap down?

14:40.402 --> 14:43.303
I'm trying to get some
sleep. I was shot today.

14:44.506 --> 14:46.440
Read, bwana. Will do.

14:48.510 --> 14:51.445
#Writing's on the wall #

14:53.314 --> 14:56.806
#Very superstitious #

17:12.022 --> 17:14.958
Anybody there?

17:15.026 --> 17:19.622
Hey, Sweden! They're not
Swedish, Mac. They're Norwegian.

18:42.515 --> 18:44.915
Mac!

19:19.586 --> 19:22.987
My God. What the hell happened here?

19:25.059 --> 19:27.687
Come on, Doc.

20:05.400 --> 20:10.269
- Portable video unit. Anything?
- It's all in Norwegian.

20:15.343 --> 20:17.277
What are you doin', Doc?

20:17.345 --> 20:19.870
Could be important work.
I wanna take it back.

20:19.948 --> 20:22.883
Well, it's gettin' late. Let's hurry it up.

20:22.951 --> 20:25.044
I'll check out the last few rooms.

20:43.472 --> 20:46.964
Hey, Copper, come here!

21:28.552 --> 21:30.486
Maybe they found a fossil,

21:30.554 --> 21:33.352
the remains of some animal buried
in the ice, and they chopped it out.

21:33.423 --> 21:35.687
But where is it? Look at this.

21:50.273 --> 21:52.969
What is that?

21:53.043 --> 21:55.978
Is that a man in there or something?

21:57.547 --> 22:00.482
Whatever it is, they burned it up in a hurry.

22:02.887 --> 22:05.720
Help me find a shovel, Doc.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.047
We found this.

23:03.115 --> 23:05.049
Jesus Christ.

23:30.409 --> 23:34.073
Blair, I'd like you to
start an autopsy right away.

24:35.075 --> 24:37.839
Did you reach anybody yet? Reach anybody?

24:37.911 --> 24:40.175
We're a thousand miles from nowhere, man,

24:40.247 --> 24:42.681
and it's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

24:42.750 --> 24:45.685
Well, stick to it, Windows. Stick to it.

24:50.891 --> 24:54.019
Nothin' wrong with this
Norwegian, physiologically anyway.

24:54.094 --> 24:57.029
No drugs, no alcohol. Nothing.

24:58.766 --> 25:00.700
Hmm?

25:19.988 --> 25:23.754
Well, what we got here is
what appears to be, anyway,

25:23.825 --> 25:26.259
a normal set of internal organs.

25:27.662 --> 25:31.496
Heart, lungs,

25:31.566 --> 25:33.557
kidneys, liver.

25:33.635 --> 25:35.569
Intestines.

25:39.474 --> 25:41.499
Seem to be normal.

25:58.961 --> 26:02.522
One, door number
two and door number three.

26:02.598 --> 26:05.863
And I think that Dawn Screen here
has got the one to trade in the most.

26:05.935 --> 26:07.960
I went to you first. You
brought your friend Anna.

26:08.037 --> 26:10.130
You've been consulting Anna
all through the show anyhow.

26:10.206 --> 26:13.698
You may as well consult her one
more time. I know how this one ends.

26:48.879 --> 26:52.781
Clark, will you put this mutt
with the others where he belongs?

26:56.253 --> 26:58.187
Yeah, okay.

27:17.875 --> 27:19.809
Go ahead.

27:23.381 --> 27:26.179
Go ahead. What are you waiting for?

30:17.425 --> 30:19.359
I don't know what the hell's in there,

30:19.427 --> 30:22.362
but it's weird and pissed off,
whatever it is. Bennings, go get Childs.

30:22.430 --> 30:24.864
What is this? What's goin' on?

30:24.933 --> 30:27.458
Hey, Palmer, what is this? I don't know.

30:27.535 --> 30:30.629
Childs, Mac wants the
flamethrower! Mac wants the what?

30:30.705 --> 30:33.674
That's what he said. Now, move! Damn it.

30:46.488 --> 30:48.752
- Stay back.
- Hey, Mac, what is it?

31:36.505 --> 31:41.033
- Don't! No!
- Get away! Get back! Get back!

32:06.470 --> 32:08.404
Get your ass over here!

32:09.906 --> 32:11.840
Burn it.

32:15.245 --> 32:17.179
Damn it, Childs. Torch it!

33:39.097 --> 33:41.031
Oh, my God.

33:47.406 --> 33:49.340
Oh!

33:49.408 --> 33:52.206
Oh!

33:56.348 --> 33:59.284
Look. Son of a bitch. Oh.

34:16.034 --> 34:17.797
You see, what we're talking about here...

34:17.870 --> 34:20.360
is an organism that
imitates other life-forms,

34:20.440 --> 34:22.373
and it imitates 'em perfectly.

34:22.442 --> 34:25.878
When this Thing attacked our
dogs, it tried to digest 'em,

34:25.945 --> 34:28.004
absorb them,

34:28.081 --> 34:32.016
and in the process, shape
its own cells to imitate them.

34:34.087 --> 34:38.547
This, for instance... That's not dog.

34:39.891 --> 34:41.826
It's imitation.

34:41.893 --> 34:45.331
We got to it before it had time to finish.

34:46.533 --> 34:48.694
Finish what?

34:48.768 --> 34:51.203
Finish imitating these dogs.

34:58.012 --> 35:02.346
Easy, easy. Good.

35:04.918 --> 35:06.852
Easy, easy.

35:11.892 --> 35:13.826
Clark. Yeah?

35:13.894 --> 35:17.489
Did you notice anything strange
about the dog, anything at all?

35:17.564 --> 35:19.623
Strange? No.

35:21.402 --> 35:23.597
What was the dog doin' in the rec room?

35:23.671 --> 35:25.662
I don't know.

35:25.739 --> 35:28.436
He was just wandering around camp all day.

35:30.745 --> 35:34.806
Are you sayin'to me the dog wasn't
put in the kennel until last night?

35:34.883 --> 35:36.612
Right.

35:38.253 --> 35:40.312
How long were you alone with that dog?

35:40.388 --> 35:45.325
I don't know. An hour.
Hour and a half, maybe.

35:46.895 --> 35:49.830
What the hell you lookin'
at me like that for?

35:52.334 --> 35:54.268
I don't know. What?

35:55.603 --> 35:58.538
I don't know. It's probably nothin'.

35:59.941 --> 36:01.875
It's nothin'at all.

36:13.122 --> 36:15.056
How much more of this crap is there?

36:15.124 --> 36:17.558
Oh, about nine hours, I'd say.

36:18.728 --> 36:20.821
We can't learn anything from this.

36:20.896 --> 36:22.830
Guess not.

36:33.109 --> 36:35.043
Where'd they take these shots?

36:36.612 --> 36:38.546
Seems like they were spendin'
a lot of their time...

36:38.614 --> 36:41.344
in a little place northeast of
their camp about five or six miles.

36:41.417 --> 36:43.851
What's that?

36:43.919 --> 36:47.855
It looks like
somethin' buried under the ice.

36:53.429 --> 36:56.866
And look at that. They're
planting thermite charges.

36:56.933 --> 37:00.869
Whatever it was, it was bigger
than that block of ice you found.

37:09.846 --> 37:12.781
Here. This is it.

37:12.849 --> 37:15.147
The place where they were spendin' most
of their time. Pretty nasty out, Mac.

37:15.218 --> 37:17.152
Thirty-five knots. Screw
it. I'm gonna go up anyway.

37:41.512 --> 37:43.446
Half a mile due east.

39:21.714 --> 39:25.775
Jesus, how long do you figure
this has been in the ice?

39:25.852 --> 39:29.788
Well, the backscatter effect's
been bringin' things up...

39:29.856 --> 39:32.654
from way down around here for a long time.

39:32.725 --> 39:37.560
I'd say... I'd say the ice it's buried
in is 100,000 years old, at least.

39:40.466 --> 39:43.094
And those Norwegians blew it up? Yeah.

40:11.799 --> 40:13.733
I don't know.

40:13.801 --> 40:16.031
Thousands of years ago, it crashes,

40:16.103 --> 40:18.367
and this Thing...

40:18.439 --> 40:22.034
gets thrown out or crawls out,
and it ends up freezing in the ice.

40:22.109 --> 40:26.068
I just cannot believe any
of this voodoo bullshit.

40:26.146 --> 40:29.377
Childs, it happens all the time, man.

40:29.450 --> 40:32.112
They're fallin' outta the skies like flies.

40:32.186 --> 40:34.450
Government knows all about it. Right, Mac?

40:34.521 --> 40:37.285
Do you believe any of this
voodoo bullshit, Blair?

40:37.358 --> 40:42.296
Childs. Childs. Chariots Of The Gods, man.

40:42.364 --> 40:44.525
They practically own South America.

40:44.599 --> 40:47.033
I mean, they taught the
Incas everything they know.

40:54.809 --> 40:56.743
Come on, now, MacReady.

40:56.811 --> 40:59.837
The Norwegians get a hold of this,
and they dig it up out of the ice.

40:59.914 --> 41:02.280
Yes, Garry, they dig it
up. They cart it back.

41:02.350 --> 41:05.911
It gets thawed out, wakes
up, not in the best of moods.

41:05.987 --> 41:08.683
I don't know. I wasn't there. Which
one of you disrespectful men...

41:08.757 --> 41:12.249
been tossin' his dirty drawers
in the kitchen trash can, huh?

41:12.327 --> 41:15.819
From now on I want my
kitchen clean, germfree.

41:15.897 --> 41:19.025
Now how's this motherfucker wake up
after thousands of years in the ice?

41:19.100 --> 41:22.035
And how could it look like
a dog? I don't know how.

41:22.103 --> 41:24.037
'Cause it's different than us, see?

41:24.105 --> 41:27.701
'Cause it's from outer space.
What do you want from me? Ask him.

41:31.480 --> 41:34.005
You buy any of this, Blair?

43:35.606 --> 43:37.540
Mac,
removin' those things...

43:37.608 --> 43:39.543
out of the lab into the storeroom.

43:39.611 --> 43:42.205
Can you come get your stuff?

43:42.281 --> 43:44.215
Be there in a minute, Doc.

44:01.633 --> 44:03.567
Through the door.

44:06.905 --> 44:08.839
Right over here. Right over...

44:11.410 --> 44:15.176
Sorry, Mac. You have to move your stuff ou...

44:15.247 --> 44:18.512
Doc says we gotta lock him up.
Stash him in here and lock him up.

44:18.584 --> 44:21.519
I have to talk to you. I'm
tired of talkin', Fuchs.

44:21.587 --> 44:23.521
I just wanna get up to
my shack and get drunk.

44:23.589 --> 44:27.026
Mac, it's important. What is it?

44:27.093 --> 44:29.687
Outside. It's 40 below outside.

44:29.762 --> 44:33.198
In the Thiokol. Please, Mac.

44:47.247 --> 44:49.738
We ought to just burn these things.

44:49.816 --> 44:52.546
Can't burn the find of the century.

44:52.619 --> 44:55.747
That's gonna win somebody the Nobel Prize.

45:08.301 --> 45:10.236
You, uh, got the keys?

45:10.304 --> 45:13.740
Get 'em from Garry. I wanna
get some stuff outta here.

45:47.775 --> 45:49.709
There's something wrong with Blair.

45:49.777 --> 45:52.109
He's locked himself in his room,
and he won't answer the door.

45:52.179 --> 45:55.946
So I took one of his
notebooks from the lab. Yeah?

45:56.017 --> 45:58.645
Listen.

45:58.720 --> 46:01.814
"It could have imitated a million
life-forms on a million planets.

46:01.890 --> 46:04.154
"Could change into any
one of them at any time.

46:04.225 --> 46:06.159
Now it wants life-forms on Earth. "

46:06.227 --> 46:08.161
It's gettin' cold in here,
and I haven't slept in days.

46:08.229 --> 46:10.163
Wait. "It needs to be alone...

46:10.231 --> 46:12.961
"and in close proximity with
a life-form to be absorbed.

46:13.034 --> 46:14.968
The chameleon strikes in the dark. "

46:15.036 --> 46:16.970
So is Blair cracking up,
or what? Damn it, MacReady.

46:17.038 --> 46:19.632
"There is still cellular
activity in these burned remains.

46:19.708 --> 46:21.642
They're not dead yet. "

46:32.954 --> 46:34.888
Let's go, Bennings. I gotta get some sleep.

46:54.543 --> 46:57.478
Holy shit.

47:01.984 --> 47:04.919
Go get the doc.

47:04.987 --> 47:07.421
I'll get Garry. We'll meet in Blair's room.

47:13.162 --> 47:15.096
It's Bennings!

47:25.709 --> 47:29.645
Bennings was right there. Mac, I
swear to God. It had a hold of him.

47:41.558 --> 47:45.494
Windows!
Windows! Keep away from him!

47:47.697 --> 47:49.631
Get back! Stay back!

47:52.936 --> 47:54.870
It isn't Bennings.

48:28.506 --> 48:30.440
My God, what was happening to him?

48:30.508 --> 48:34.103
If it had more time it would have
looked, sounded and acted like Bennings.

48:34.178 --> 48:36.271
I don't know what you're saying.

48:36.347 --> 48:40.681
That was one of those Things out
there trying to imitate him, Garry.

48:43.421 --> 48:47.517
- Come on.
- MacReady, I know Bennings. I've known him for ten years.

48:47.592 --> 48:49.526
He's my friend.

48:49.594 --> 48:52.223
We've gotta burn the rest of'em.

49:26.198 --> 49:28.132
All right, step back.

49:53.860 --> 49:55.794
You sure that's all of'em?

49:55.862 --> 50:00.458
We cleaned out the storehouse,
the lab. There is nothin' left.

50:00.533 --> 50:02.467
Where's Blair?

50:43.744 --> 50:46.474
I can't find Blair.

50:46.547 --> 50:48.674
Where's everybody else?

50:48.749 --> 50:53.413
Windows is in the radio room still trying to
get through. Everyone else, in the rec room.

50:53.487 --> 50:56.149
Well, you go on. I'll be in in a minute.

51:19.047 --> 51:20.981
Blair?

51:22.150 --> 51:24.084
Blair?

52:21.744 --> 52:25.441
Don't! You son of
a bitch. You understand me?

52:25.514 --> 52:28.574
- He's got a gun. Get back.
- Anybody interferes, I'll kill 'em.

52:28.651 --> 52:31.085
- Jesus.
- Just leave it here. We're gonna talk.

52:31.153 --> 52:33.087
He smashed up some of
the chopper pretty good.

52:33.155 --> 52:35.089
Nobody talk to nobody!

52:35.157 --> 52:38.150
Childs, go see if he got
to the tractor.

52:38.228 --> 52:40.788
Nobody gets in and outta here. Nobody.

52:47.437 --> 52:52.033
You guys think I'm crazy. Well, that's fine.

52:52.109 --> 52:55.545
Most of you don't know
what's goin' on around here.

52:55.612 --> 53:00.106
Well, I'm damn well sure some of you do.

53:00.183 --> 53:02.117
Christ.

53:05.188 --> 53:09.056
He got most of the chopper and the tractor,
and he's killed the rest of the dogs.

53:12.696 --> 53:15.631
Garry, wait a minute, wait a minute.

53:15.699 --> 53:19.635
Now, Childs, go around to the
map room door. Talk to him.

53:19.703 --> 53:21.638
Okay.

53:21.706 --> 53:24.903
Norris, get a table from the lab.

53:26.544 --> 53:30.810
Do you think that Thing
wanted to be an animal?

53:30.882 --> 53:34.010
No dogs make it a thousand
miles through the cold.

53:36.921 --> 53:40.322
Nah, you don't understand!

53:40.391 --> 53:42.359
That Thing wanted to be us.

53:42.427 --> 53:45.863
If the cell gets out...

53:45.930 --> 53:47.898
it could imitate everything
on the face of the earth...

53:47.965 --> 53:50.525
and it's not gonna stop! Okay, Blair.

53:52.103 --> 53:54.037
Come on, man, you don't wanna hurt anybody.

53:54.972 --> 53:57.167
I'll kill you.

54:22.100 --> 54:24.034
Good shot, MacReady.

54:24.102 --> 54:26.036
Excuse me. Okay.

54:26.104 --> 54:28.038
All right, bring him up. Yeah.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.095
Come on, Blair.

54:55.635 --> 55:00.129
What about your shack? I don't want him in
my shack. We'll lock him in the toolshed.

55:05.144 --> 55:08.739
Why am I in here? For
your own protection, Blair.

55:23.062 --> 55:25.121
How you doin', old boy?

55:29.135 --> 55:31.899
I don't know who to trust.

55:31.971 --> 55:35.738
I know
what you mean, Blair.

55:35.809 --> 55:38.972
Trust's a tough thing to come by these days.

55:39.046 --> 55:41.810
Tell you what.

55:41.882 --> 55:44.942
Why don't you just trust in the Lord?

55:47.087 --> 55:50.386
Watch Clark. What?

55:51.325 --> 55:55.091
I said, watch Clark.

55:55.162 --> 55:58.131
And watch him close. Do you hear me?

56:16.150 --> 56:18.175
And now the radio's gone.

56:18.252 --> 56:21.279
And so are the choppers.
We're completely cut off.

56:21.356 --> 56:25.122
All we can do now is hole up 'til
spring, wait for the rescue team.

56:25.193 --> 56:29.323
No, we don't wait. Somebody in this
camp ain't what he appears to be.

56:29.397 --> 56:33.356
Right now that may be one or two of
us. By spring, it could be all of us.

56:33.435 --> 56:36.268
So how do we know who's human?

56:36.338 --> 56:39.239
If I was an imitation...
a perfect imitation...

56:39.307 --> 56:42.970
how would you know if it was really me?

56:48.016 --> 56:50.280
Is there some kind of test, Doc?

56:50.352 --> 56:54.948
Well, yeah, possibly. I've been
thinkin' about a blood serum test.

56:55.023 --> 56:56.820
What's that?

56:56.891 --> 57:01.590
We could take a sample of each person's
blood, mix it with uncontaminated blood.

57:01.663 --> 57:04.929
I suppose if there's a reaction,
we'd know who isn't human.

57:05.001 --> 57:09.028
- We've got whole blood in storage.
- Start working on it.

57:09.105 --> 57:11.039
Keep an eye on Clark.

57:11.107 --> 57:14.076
He was close to that dog.

57:14.143 --> 57:16.338
Yeah. Yeah.

57:20.716 --> 57:23.412
Mac, we need Blair's help.

57:23.486 --> 57:26.819
He's the only one who knows
this organism. He's too far gone.

57:26.889 --> 57:30.825
But get the rest of his
notebooks. Start goin' through 'em.

57:41.837 --> 57:45.238
Garry! Hey, you guys, come here!

57:47.643 --> 57:50.078
What? Somebody got to the blood.

57:50.147 --> 57:52.012
What?

57:52.082 --> 57:54.880
Where's Clark? Right here.

57:54.951 --> 57:58.580
Wait a minute. Was this broken
into? The lock is undamaged.

57:58.655 --> 58:01.522
Somebody opened it, closed it,
then locked it.  Great.

58:01.591 --> 58:04.185
Who's got access to it?

58:08.732 --> 58:11.064
I guess I'm the only one.

58:11.134 --> 58:13.466
And I got the only key.

58:16.773 --> 58:20.174
Would that test have
worked, Doc? I think so, yes.

58:20.243 --> 58:22.473
Somebody else
sure as hell thought so.

58:22.546 --> 58:25.743
Well, who else could've used that key?

58:25.816 --> 58:28.808
Nobody! I just give it to
Copper whenever he needs it.

58:28.885 --> 58:31.479
Could anybody have gotten it from you, Doc?

58:31.555 --> 58:34.992
I don't see how. As soon as I'm
finished, I return it right away.

58:37.729 --> 58:39.663
Great.

58:39.731 --> 58:44.065
When was the last time
you used it?  Day or so ago.

58:46.003 --> 58:49.530
I suppose somebody could have
lifted it off me... Oh, come on!

58:49.607 --> 58:52.940
That key ring of yours is always
hooked to your belt.

58:53.010 --> 58:57.879
- Accusing everybody...
-  Stop it! It ain't worth it!

58:57.949 --> 59:00.850
Copper's the only one who's got any
business with it.  Wait a minute!

59:00.918 --> 59:03.944
You've been in here on several
occasions. Doc thought of the test.

59:04.021 --> 59:07.718
So what? Is that
supposed to clear him?

59:07.792 --> 59:08.850
Windows! Windows!

59:23.041 --> 59:24.975
Put that down!

59:25.043 --> 59:28.240
No. I'll put this right through your head.

59:28.313 --> 59:31.339
You guys gonna listen to Garry?

59:31.416 --> 59:34.783
You gonna let him give the orders?
He could be one of those Things.

59:34.853 --> 59:37.481
Windows. Wait a minute.

59:37.556 --> 59:40.525
Just take it easy. Put the gun down.

59:40.592 --> 59:43.493
Put it down. You don't
want to hurt anybody. Right.

59:43.562 --> 59:45.928
On the floor.

59:59.311 --> 01:00:01.836
It's on the floor.

01:00:08.922 --> 01:00:11.755
I don't know about Copper,

01:00:11.825 --> 01:00:15.124
but I give you my word, I
did not go near that blood.

01:00:22.936 --> 01:00:25.871
But I guess you'll all
feel a little easier...

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:30.506
if somebody else was in charge.

01:00:30.577 --> 01:00:34.536
Norris, I can't see anybody objecting to you.

01:00:38.251 --> 01:00:40.617
I'm sorry, fellas, but I'm not up to it.

01:00:40.687 --> 01:00:44.350
I'll take it. Like hell you will.

01:00:44.424 --> 01:00:48.088
It should be somebody a little
more even-tempered, Childs.

01:00:58.639 --> 01:01:00.607
All right.

01:01:22.129 --> 01:01:25.860
I know I'm human.

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:32.132
And if you were all these Things,
then you'd just attack me right now.

01:01:32.206 --> 01:01:34.471
So some of you are still human.

01:01:34.542 --> 01:01:39.980
This Thing doesn't want to show itself.
It wants to hide inside an imitation.

01:01:41.082 --> 01:01:43.107
It'll fight if it has to.

01:01:43.184 --> 01:01:46.585
But it's vulnerable out in the open.

01:01:46.655 --> 01:01:50.056
If it takes us over,

01:01:50.125 --> 01:01:53.094
then it has no more enemies,

01:01:53.161 --> 01:01:55.322
nobody left to kill it.

01:01:56.398 --> 01:01:58.332
And then it's won.

01:02:01.937 --> 01:02:04.929
There's a storm hitting us in six hours.

01:02:05.006 --> 01:02:07.736
We're gonna find out who's who.

01:02:07.809 --> 01:02:11.609
All right, Doc, Garry and Clark,
move over there away from the others.

01:02:23.559 --> 01:02:28.087
Norris, you and Childs shoot 'em up with morphine.
Tie 'em down in the rec room and watch 'em.

01:02:28.164 --> 01:02:30.428
Fuchs, you start working on a
new technique. I need Doc's help.

01:02:30.499 --> 01:02:35.664
You don't wanna drug me.
Mac, I'm not a prisoner!

01:02:56.592 --> 01:02:59.425
Let-Let me do it. You're gonna
break the needle in my arm.

01:02:59.495 --> 01:03:03.091
No, Doc, he's doing a real fine job.

01:03:11.174 --> 01:03:14.143
I'm gonna hide this tape when I'm finished.

01:03:14.211 --> 01:03:18.443
If none of us make it, at least
there'll be some kind of record.

01:03:18.515 --> 01:03:22.679
Storm's been hitting us
hard now for 48 hours.

01:03:22.753 --> 01:03:25.119
We still have nothing to go on.

01:03:37.034 --> 01:03:40.902
One other thing, I think it
rips through your clothes...

01:03:40.971 --> 01:03:43.565
when it takes you over.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:48.544
Windows found some shredded long
johns, but the name tag was missing.

01:03:48.613 --> 01:03:50.911
They could be anybody's.

01:03:52.383 --> 01:03:54.351
Nobody...

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:58.882
Nobody trusts anybody now.

01:04:00.258 --> 01:04:03.091
And we're all very tired.

01:04:09.467 --> 01:04:11.935
Nobody trusts anybody now.

01:04:15.306 --> 01:04:18.503
There's nothing else I can do.

01:04:18.576 --> 01:04:20.771
Just wait.

01:04:23.714 --> 01:04:27.514
R.J. MacReady, helicopter
pilot, U.S. Outpost, number 31.

01:04:42.201 --> 01:04:44.761
You come up with anything yet?

01:04:44.837 --> 01:04:47.135
One or two ideas.

01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:52.642
But, MacReady, I've been thinking.

01:04:52.711 --> 01:04:56.841
If a small particle of this Thing is
enough to take over an entire organism,

01:04:56.915 --> 01:04:59.383
then everyone should prepare their own meals.

01:04:59.451 --> 01:05:01.544
And I suggest we only eat out of cans.

01:05:02.754 --> 01:05:04.688
All right.

01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:39.254
Who's that?

01:06:16.263 --> 01:06:18.697
Anybody see Fuchs?

01:06:21.502 --> 01:06:23.800
Somebody blew out a fuse in the lab.

01:06:23.871 --> 01:06:27.034
Lights were out for an hour.
Anyone of us could've gotten to him.

01:06:27.107 --> 01:06:32.170
All right, we gotta find him. Nauls, why
don't you come with me and we'll look outside.

01:06:32.246 --> 01:06:34.510
Palmer, you and Windows check the inside.

01:06:34.582 --> 01:06:37.642
I ain't goin' with Windows.

01:06:37.718 --> 01:06:41.085
I ain't goin' with him. I'll go with Childs.

01:06:41.155 --> 01:06:44.022
Hey, fuck you, Palmer!
I ain't goin' with you!

01:06:44.091 --> 01:06:46.424
Who says I want you
goin' with me? Cut the bullshit!

01:06:49.931 --> 01:06:52.331
Windows, you come with
us. Norris, you stay here.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:55.927
Any of them move, you fry 'em. You
hear anything, cut loose on the sirens.

01:06:56.004 --> 01:06:59.906
We all meet back here
in 20 minutes regardless.

01:06:59.975 --> 01:07:04.173
And everybody watch whoever
you're with... real close.

01:07:26.401 --> 01:07:28.335
Hey, Blair.

01:07:30.273 --> 01:07:33.106
Blair, have you seen Fuchs?

01:07:36.045 --> 01:07:39.572
I don't wanna stay out here
anymore. I wanna come back inside.

01:07:43.319 --> 01:07:45.685
I hear funny things out here.

01:07:45.755 --> 01:07:48.519
Have you come across Fuchs? It ain't Fuchs.

01:07:51.193 --> 01:07:53.627
It ain't Fuchs.

01:07:55.431 --> 01:07:58.298
I'm not gonna harm anybody.
There's nothing wrong with me.

01:07:58.367 --> 01:08:02.167
And if there was, I'm all better
now. I'd like to come back inside.

01:08:02.238 --> 01:08:04.536
Now you've got my promise.

01:08:06.809 --> 01:08:09.209
We'll see.

01:08:09.278 --> 01:08:12.577
Wait a minute, man.

01:08:12.648 --> 01:08:16.210
I wanna come back inside,
don't you understand?

01:08:16.286 --> 01:08:20.484
I'm all right. I'm much better...
and I won't harm anybody.

01:08:20.557 --> 01:08:23.651
You gotta let me come back inside.

01:08:30.267 --> 01:08:32.201
Hold it!

01:08:46.316 --> 01:08:48.250
Is it Fuchs?

01:08:55.559 --> 01:08:57.890
Yeah.

01:08:57.961 --> 01:09:00.453
Why would it burn him?

01:09:00.531 --> 01:09:04.023
Flare. Maybe he tried to burn it.

01:09:06.437 --> 01:09:10.395
Maybe he burned himself
before it could get to him.

01:09:17.348 --> 01:09:20.715
Great! Now what are we gonna do?

01:09:22.185 --> 01:09:24.916
You go inside. Tell the
others we found Fuchs.

01:09:24.988 --> 01:09:28.287
We'll be in as soon as we
can. Where are we going?

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:30.850
Up to my shack. What the hell for?

01:09:30.928 --> 01:09:34.125
'Cause when I left yesterday,
I turned the lights off.

01:09:56.755 --> 01:09:59.519
How long have they been out there?

01:09:59.591 --> 01:10:02.287
Forty, 45 minutes.

01:10:02.361 --> 01:10:05.421
We better start closing
off the outside doors.

01:10:37.464 --> 01:10:40.399
Hey! All of you, come here!

01:10:56.049 --> 01:10:59.746
Open up! Open up
this door! Open up! Open up!

01:11:01.721 --> 01:11:03.712
Close that door.

01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:08.124
Where's MacReady?

01:11:08.194 --> 01:11:11.288
I cut him loose of the line up by his shack.

01:11:11.364 --> 01:11:12.922
Cut him loose? Yeah.

01:11:12.999 --> 01:11:16.731
We were up checkin' around
his place, I found this.

01:11:18.272 --> 01:11:22.436
Look. It was stashed in his oil furnace.

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:26.276
Wind must've dislodged it, but
I don't think he saw me find it.

01:11:26.347 --> 01:11:31.478
I made sure I got ahead of him on the
towline on the way back. I cut him loose.

01:11:31.552 --> 01:11:34.248
MacReady? He's one of'em.

01:11:34.321 --> 01:11:36.551
- When do you think it got to him?
- I don't know.

01:11:36.624 --> 01:11:38.922
It could've been anytime, anywhere.

01:11:38.993 --> 01:11:41.188
If it did get to him.

01:11:41.262 --> 01:11:44.595
Look, Childs, come on. When the lights
went out. That would've been perfect.

01:11:44.665 --> 01:11:48.123
Right. You said guys were
missing. Windows, where were you?

01:11:48.202 --> 01:11:51.171
I told you to shut your mouth!

01:11:51.238 --> 01:11:55.470
This is just what it
wants! To pit us against each other.

01:12:01.316 --> 01:12:03.284
Let's open it. Hell no!

01:12:03.351 --> 01:12:06.047
You think he's changed into one
of those Things? He's had time.

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:09.215
Nothing human could've made it back here
in this weather without a guide line.

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:12.158
Let's open it now. Why are you
so anxious to let him in here?

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:16.095
Because it's so close. May be our best
chance to blow it away. Let him freeze.

01:12:16.164 --> 01:12:18.928
Childs, what if we're wrong about him?

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.833
Well then, we're wrong!

01:12:21.903 --> 01:12:23.928
The supply window!

01:12:24.005 --> 01:12:28.101
All right, all right, we got no choice now!

01:12:31.112 --> 01:12:33.410
Damn it! He's got the keys!

01:12:33.481 --> 01:12:36.382
What's going
on? The towline snapped.

01:12:36.451 --> 01:12:40.251
Bullshit, Childs. He's got
to know damn well I cut it!

01:12:42.157 --> 01:12:45.184
You're a dead man, MacReady!

01:12:45.261 --> 01:12:47.559
Or a dead whatever the hell you are!

01:12:58.074 --> 01:13:00.565
Anyone messes with me
and the whole camp goes.

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:04.235
Come on, Childs, burn me.

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:09.213
Put those torches on the floor and back off.

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:19.752
Back off. Way off.

01:13:28.972 --> 01:13:32.032
You asshole. You'd have done the same thing.

01:13:32.109 --> 01:13:34.634
Don't argue with him.

01:13:34.711 --> 01:13:37.771
Where's the rest?

01:13:41.018 --> 01:13:42.918
Come on, man, I mean it!

01:13:42.986 --> 01:13:45.181
It's cool, MacReady, come on.

01:13:45.255 --> 01:13:47.723
Yeah. Yeah, man, just relax.

01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:51.989
Anybody touches me...  and we go.

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:07.771
- He's not breathin'!
- Go untie the doc.

01:14:09.813 --> 01:14:12.442
Get him in here. And bring the others.

01:14:14.652 --> 01:14:17.780
From now on, nobody gets outta my sight.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.332
Let me at him.

01:14:34.439 --> 01:14:38.739
So, you sweethearts were about
to have a little lynching party, huh?

01:14:40.445 --> 01:14:44.142
I might just have to put an end to
you on general principles, Nauls.

01:14:44.215 --> 01:14:47.912
Did it ever occur to the jury that anybody
could've gotten some of my clothes...

01:14:47.985 --> 01:14:50.920
and stuck 'em up the furnace?
We ain't buyin' that.

01:14:50.988 --> 01:14:54.981
Quit that bickerin' over there! Windows,
wheel that defibrillator over here.

01:14:55.059 --> 01:14:57.290
Gimme those paddles!

01:14:57.362 --> 01:14:59.796
You're gonna have
to sleep sometime, MacReady.

01:14:59.865 --> 01:15:02.959
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs.

01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:09.000
If anyone tries to wake me... Uh-uh.

01:15:09.074 --> 01:15:11.975
Clear!

01:15:18.851 --> 01:15:21.479
Clear! Clear.

01:16:21.347 --> 01:16:24.475
We're on fire, MacReady! We're
on fire! Get back! Just wait!

01:16:32.459 --> 01:16:34.484
All right, go!

01:16:55.549 --> 01:16:58.245
Windows! Windows, get in here!

01:17:23.311 --> 01:17:26.474
You gotta be fuckin' kidding.

01:17:45.433 --> 01:17:48.493
What do you got in mind,
MacReady? A little test.

01:17:48.570 --> 01:17:53.803
And, Windows, you and Palmer, tie
everybody down real tight. What for?

01:17:53.875 --> 01:17:57.903
- For your health.
- Let's rush him! He's not gonna blow us all up!

01:18:01.017 --> 01:18:03.884
No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:18:03.953 --> 01:18:07.889
Let's... Let's do what Mac says.

01:18:07.957 --> 01:18:12.656
I mean, uh, he wasted Norris pretty quick,
didn't he? That's close enough, Clark.

01:18:12.728 --> 01:18:16.858
- He ain't tyin' me up.
- Then I'll have to kill you, Childs.

01:18:16.933 --> 01:18:19.629
Then kill me.

01:18:27.810 --> 01:18:30.210
I mean it.

01:18:35.518 --> 01:18:38.510
I guess you do.

01:18:50.367 --> 01:18:52.892
Geez. This is bullshit, Mac!

01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:55.837
Finish it,
Palmer. They're dead, Mac!

01:19:00.811 --> 01:19:03.746
Windows?  Yo?

01:19:03.814 --> 01:19:07.079
You tie up Palmer over here.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:14.256
We're gonna draw a
little bit of everybody's blood...

01:19:16.259 --> 01:19:18.750
'cause we're gonna find out who's the Thing.

01:19:20.197 --> 01:19:24.293
Watchin'Norris in there
gave me the idea that...

01:19:24.368 --> 01:19:28.396
maybe every part of him was a whole.

01:19:28.473 --> 01:19:31.909
Every little piece was
an individual animal...

01:19:31.976 --> 01:19:35.275
with a built-in desire
to protect its own life.

01:19:37.382 --> 01:19:41.614
You see, when a man bleeds,

01:19:41.686 --> 01:19:44.052
it's just tissue.

01:19:45.556 --> 01:19:49.720
The blood from one of you Things
won't obey when it's attacked.

01:19:49.794 --> 01:19:52.228
It'll try and survive.

01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:57.100
Crawl away from a hot needle the same.

01:20:18.257 --> 01:20:20.248
Now you.

01:20:43.515 --> 01:20:45.380
That's good.

01:20:45.451 --> 01:20:48.181
All right, move back, over there.

01:21:35.468 --> 01:21:37.766
I guess you're okay.

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:42.768
All right. Put that on and watch them.

01:21:51.519 --> 01:21:54.886
Now I'll show you what I already know.

01:21:59.126 --> 01:22:01.594
It's a crock of shit.

01:22:01.662 --> 01:22:04.631
Let's try the doc and Clark.

01:22:22.016 --> 01:22:23.950
Now Clark.

01:22:32.894 --> 01:22:36.421
Then Clark was human, huh?

01:22:36.498 --> 01:22:39.331
Which makes you a murderer, don't it?

01:22:39.401 --> 01:22:41.335
Palmer now.

01:22:46.308 --> 01:22:50.768
This is pure nonsense.
It doesn't prove a thing.

01:22:50.845 --> 01:22:55.509
I thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were
the only one that could've got to that blood.

01:22:55.584 --> 01:22:57.848
We'll do you last.

01:23:00.922 --> 01:23:04.551
Get him away from me! MacReady, burn it!

01:23:04.626 --> 01:23:07.390
-What is it?

01:23:16.005 --> 01:23:17.939
-Come on!

01:23:25.448 --> 01:23:27.712
Get me outta here!

01:23:32.088 --> 01:23:34.022
Windows, blast him!

01:23:36.859 --> 01:23:41.523
Get me outta
here! Get me outta here!

01:24:09.092 --> 01:24:10.719
Windows!

01:24:31.181 --> 01:24:33.342
Get me outta here!

01:24:54.305 --> 01:24:57.832
MacReady, get in here! Come on, hurry up!

01:24:57.909 --> 01:25:01.276
He's coming back! Burn it!
Burn it, for God's sake!

01:25:01.346 --> 01:25:04.543
Hurry up, MacReady! Burn it!

01:25:36.515 --> 01:25:38.346
Let's do it.

01:25:52.598 --> 01:25:55.897
Get me outta here! Cut me loose!

01:25:55.968 --> 01:25:59.734
Cut me the hell... Come on, get me
outta here! Come on, get me outta here!

01:25:59.805 --> 01:26:02.365
Cut me loose, damn it!

01:26:19.959 --> 01:26:23.486
I know you gentlemen have been through a lot,

01:26:23.563 --> 01:26:26.657
but when you find the time,

01:26:26.733 --> 01:26:31.796
I'd rather not spend the rest of this
winter tied to this fuckin' couch!

01:26:53.394 --> 01:26:55.362
Childs.

01:26:55.429 --> 01:26:58.956
We're goin' out to give Blair the test.
If he tries to make it back here...

01:26:59.033 --> 01:27:01.968
and we're not with him... burn him.

01:27:21.655 --> 01:27:23.953
Mac, the door's open!

01:27:38.707 --> 01:27:42.438
How'd he get out? The door
was bolted from the outside.

01:28:26.722 --> 01:28:28.781
Blair?

01:28:31.594 --> 01:28:36.395
Hey, Blair, you down
there? We got somethin' for ya!

01:28:46.876 --> 01:28:50.243
Blair's been
busy out here all by himself.

01:28:59.889 --> 01:29:03.290
What is it? Something he's been making.

01:29:03.359 --> 01:29:05.759
It's a ship of some kind.

01:29:06.997 --> 01:29:09.261
He stole the parts from the helicopter.

01:29:09.333 --> 01:29:13.394
The smart S.O.B. put it
together piece by piece.

01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:15.597
Where was he tryin' to go?

01:29:16.873 --> 01:29:19.171
Anyplace but here.

01:29:57.415 --> 01:30:00.748
Hey, you guys, come here. Come here.

01:30:07.458 --> 01:30:11.224
I think I saw Childs outside
the main entrance of the camp.

01:30:11.295 --> 01:30:13.889
What's he doin' outside?
I don't know.

01:30:24.776 --> 01:30:27.108
Got a flare?

01:30:29.747 --> 01:30:32.944
He got back inside and blew the generator.

01:30:35.019 --> 01:30:37.454
In six hours, it'll be
a hundred below in here.

01:30:37.523 --> 01:30:39.582
Well, that's suicide!

01:30:39.658 --> 01:30:42.183
Not for that Thing.

01:30:42.261 --> 01:30:45.890
It wants to freeze now.
It's got no way outta here.

01:30:45.964 --> 01:30:50.025
It just wants to go to sleep in the
cold until the rescue team finds it.

01:30:51.437 --> 01:30:54.167
What can we do? What can we do?

01:30:54.239 --> 01:30:58.403
Whether we make it or not, we
can't let that Thing freeze again.

01:31:00.546 --> 01:31:04.243
Maybe we'll just warm things
up a little around here.

01:31:07.886 --> 01:31:10.787
We're not gettin' outta here alive.

01:31:12.324 --> 01:31:15.020
But neither is that Thing.

01:33:04.706 --> 01:33:06.731
Generator room.

01:34:13.876 --> 01:34:15.810
The generator's gone.

01:34:15.878 --> 01:34:18.369
Any way we can fix it?

01:34:20.017 --> 01:34:22.542
It's gone, MacReady.

01:34:29.192 --> 01:34:32.650
All right.

01:34:32.729 --> 01:34:36.563
We gotta bring this whole
place right down into the ice.

01:34:36.633 --> 01:34:40.034
Garry, plant yours in the old storage room.

01:34:40.103 --> 01:34:43.869
Nauls, down by the generator.

01:35:32.857 --> 01:35:34.984
Ah, God!

01:36:45.065 --> 01:36:47.260
How's it comin' in there?

01:36:48.535 --> 01:36:50.469
I said, how's it...

01:38:35.810 --> 01:38:37.937
Yeah, fuck you too!

01:40:03.433 --> 01:40:06.459
You the only one who made it?

01:40:06.536 --> 01:40:09.004
Not the only one.

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:13.034
Did you kill it?

01:40:13.110 --> 01:40:16.671
Where were you, Childs?

01:40:16.747 --> 01:40:18.739
Thought I saw Blair.

01:40:20.018 --> 01:40:24.455
I went out after him and
got lost in the storm.

01:40:34.098 --> 01:40:37.295
Fire's got the temperature
up all over the camp.

01:40:39.370 --> 01:40:41.600
Won't last long, though.

01:40:41.673 --> 01:40:43.971
Neither will we.

01:40:46.377 --> 01:40:48.902
How will we make it?

01:40:50.181 --> 01:40:52.240
Maybe we shouldn't.

01:40:56.654 --> 01:40:58.747
If you're worried about me...

01:40:58.823 --> 01:41:01.792
If we've got any surprises for each other,

01:41:03.562 --> 01:41:07.123
I don't think we're in much
shape to do anything about it.

01:41:11.036 --> 01:41:15.029
Well... what do we do?

01:41:16.208 --> 01:41:18.506
Why don't we just...

01:41:19.778 --> 01:41:22.770
wait here for a little while?

01:41:24.450 --> 01:41:26.418
See what happens.
