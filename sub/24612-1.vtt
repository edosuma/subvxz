07:36.957 --> 07:39.691
            Well, if history has
             taught us anything,

07:39.693 --> 07:42.160
          it's that this evening
        is almost certain to end

07:42.162 --> 07:43.962
        with me stealing a boat.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.831
             Is that something?
          I don't even know why.

07:45.833 --> 07:46.832
                   Hey, uh, Jim.
                      Could I...

07:46.834 --> 07:48.500
           Y-- One --
       Pardon me a moment.

07:48.502 --> 07:49.901
   Yes, my friend?

07:49.903 --> 07:52.637
        Art Newly just announced
   that he's officially retiring

07:52.639 --> 07:53.638
       at the end of the season,

07:53.640 --> 07:55.907
              and the new head
             of PR from Atlanta

07:55.909 --> 07:57.209
         is coming down tomorrow
               for a meeting.

07:57.211 --> 07:59.311
   Now, I don't want you to read
             too much into this.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.613
 -Holy shit! I did it! I did it!
      -We still don't know.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.015
No, I made it back to the top
of the mountain, Charles.

08:04.017 --> 08:04.917
     Oh, my God!

08:04.919 --> 08:06.718
I could not have done it
    without you.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.320
  I love you! Mwah!
I love you, Charles.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.457
I can't believe you won't
 say it back to me.

08:11.459 --> 08:12.658
          I am not gonna say it,

08:12.660 --> 08:14.393
             and I can't believe
         you're saying it to me.

08:14.395 --> 08:16.094
That's just gonna make it
   all the sweeter

08:16.096 --> 08:17.395
when I finally wear you down.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.831
But tonight is about
 celebratin', baby!

08:19.833 --> 08:21.132
                Not too hard.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.601
              You s-- You have
           the meeting tomorrow.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.202
        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
   All right. Hey, everybody.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.071
      Everybody, I want you
    to show me your cocaine.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.773
     Who's carrying cocaine?
      Hold it on up there.

08:28.775 --> 08:29.941
          -I got some.
             -Okay.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.142
           Let's see.
        -Me, me, me, me!

08:31.144 --> 08:32.611
           Right here.
           -All right.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.346
       That appears to be
       only an eight ball.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.746
  So I'm gonna go with you two

08:35.749 --> 08:37.982
          'cause I got
      a busy day tomorrow!

08:40.820 --> 08:41.553
      [Elevator bell dings]

08:41.554 --> 08:42.620
    You could say
   what you will,

08:42.621 --> 08:44.623
    but I am just
so happy for you, bro.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.757
                  Oh, well,
               thank you, Raj.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.626
          Could not have done it
             without you calling

08:47.628 --> 08:49.694
           all those road games.
    No, you've been a lifesaver.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.429
      Come on.
  Look, thank you.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.631
I just enjoyed joining your
brotherhood of the booth.

08:53.633 --> 08:54.832
   And I must say,

08:54.834 --> 08:57.569
         you're much less racist
        than I thought you'd be.

08:57.571 --> 08:58.703
 Well, my goodness.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.772
 I wish I could take
more credit for that,

09:00.774 --> 09:03.241
  but, uh, the bar
set by old white men

09:03.243 --> 09:05.644
in this great country of ours
is just, oh, so very low.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.779
 Yep. As soon as you raise it up
                a little bit,

09:07.781 --> 09:09.848
              someone knocks it
               back down, huh?

09:09.850 --> 09:11.850
   Man, you keep screwing up.
             -We do.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.252
       Listen, let's commemorate
     this hand-off on the 'gram.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.020
          Get in here.
   -Ah, the ubiquitous 'gram.

09:16.022 --> 09:17.523
            -Mm-hmm.
  -All right. Hey, whoa, whoa!

09:17.525 --> 09:18.924
    What are you doing here,
            asshole?

09:18.926 --> 09:19.925
        -Whoa, whoa! Jim!
          -What's that?

09:19.927 --> 09:22.260
     Hey, look,
I invited him, okay? Look --

09:22.262 --> 09:24.862
        -You invited him?
  -Yes. You're both my brohams,

09:24.864 --> 09:26.732
               so I was hoping
          we could end this feud

09:26.734 --> 09:28.867
because you actually have
a lot in common, okay?

09:28.869 --> 09:31.336
 You're both really
stubborn superstars.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.071
         I mean, you --
     -Whoa, whoa. Superstar?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.339
             Are you kidding me?

09:34.341 --> 09:36.574
  Hey, I've known all the titans
             of mascotry, okay?

09:36.576 --> 09:39.210
           The Phillie Phanatic,
       he officiated my wedding.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.278
        You are not a superstar.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.247
               You are a mime
           in Muppet's clothing.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.381
            What -- What's that?

09:43.383 --> 09:44.249
    What is that?
I don't even understand that.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.551
                   I think
          he's flipping you off.

09:45.553 --> 09:49.087
       You fuck your mother with
    that claw, you stupid idiot?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.023
            -Come on!
         -Jim Brockmire?

09:51.025 --> 09:52.157
             -Yeah.
     -I'm Whitney Masterson.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.359
     I'm the new head of PR
          for Atlanta.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.461
    Is -- Is there a problem?
            -No, no.

09:56.463 --> 09:59.230
   I mean, I don't pretend to be
      a crustacean for a living,

09:59.232 --> 10:01.499
              so I'm very good,
                 thank you.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.569
      Raj, can you join us,
        as well, please?

10:04.471 --> 10:06.371
               Yeah. Come on.
              More the merrier.

10:06.373 --> 10:09.041
              Plan the old line
             of succession here.

10:09.043 --> 10:13.311
   Hey, medium mascot talent!
            At best!

10:13.313 --> 10:14.579
             Dummy!

10:14.581 --> 10:17.049
             First of all, Jim,
              the organization

10:17.051 --> 10:18.249
             wishes to thank you
                  for doing

10:18.251 --> 10:20.719
        all that it asked of you
             over the last year.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.554
       Well, please thank
        the organization

10:22.556 --> 10:24.922
      for doing everything
        I asked of them.
                    [Chuckles]

10:24.924 --> 10:27.525
        It was a little unusual,
        only calling home games,

10:27.527 --> 10:30.462
             and it was a bit of
       a strange contract rider.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.863
                  I mean...

10:31.865 --> 10:35.467
    "Jim Brockmire does not ride
   the bus -- exclamation point.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.669
           Make sure they spell
            'exclamation point'

10:37.671 --> 10:41.272
         because that's how much
  I don't want to ride the bus."

10:41.274 --> 10:42.941
         Yeah, you know,
      I used to say the bus

10:42.943 --> 10:45.010
          is just like
   a concentration-camp train

10:45.012 --> 10:46.011
      that made more stops,

10:46.013 --> 10:48.146
         but, uh, well,
      I quickly discovered

10:48.148 --> 10:50.014
       that people prefer
      their Holocaust humor

10:50.016 --> 10:51.483
             to come
      from Roberto Benigni

10:51.485 --> 10:53.685
         and [Chuckles]
    pretty much nobody else.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.486
                    Okay.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.155
       Before I was hired in PR,

10:57.157 --> 10:59.424
              I interned in the
           analytics department,

10:59.426 --> 11:02.627
            and I learned a very
              important lesson.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.596
             Human perception...

11:04.598 --> 11:05.830
                  is a lie.

11:05.832 --> 11:09.034
         But math -- math always
              tells the truth.

11:09.036 --> 11:12.704
   For example, we believed that
    hiring an Internet celebrity

11:12.706 --> 11:13.838
        would bring in new fans,

11:13.840 --> 11:17.508
            but the numbers told
             a different story.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.977
         What is that --
      like, two pie charts?

11:18.979 --> 11:20.779
       I don't understand
        what's happening.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.981
       It's a Venn diagram, Jim.

11:22.983 --> 11:23.749
            Oh. Okay.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.583
                  According
              to focus groups,

11:25.585 --> 11:28.719
                  our fans
             hate your podcast,

11:28.721 --> 11:32.056
           and your podcast fans
               hate baseball.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.257
       Interesting, right?
            -Mm-hmm.

11:33.259 --> 11:36.461
             So, next, we tested
         that same group to find

11:36.463 --> 11:38.863
       Art Newly's likability --

11:38.865 --> 11:40.866
               92 out of 100.

11:40.868 --> 11:44.135
            I mean, makes sense.
    He's beloved by generations.

11:44.137 --> 11:49.140
            Then, we tested, uh,
              Jim's likability.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.875
               67.
              -Ha!

11:50.877 --> 11:51.943
             -Okay.
             -Yeah!

11:51.945 --> 11:54.879
     -Is that a good number?
        -Great question.

11:54.881 --> 11:58.617
             We needed context.
            We needed a control.

11:58.619 --> 12:00.318
              So we tested Raj.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.087
              And here's where
            it gets interesting.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.689
                Raj is an 84.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.024
     [Chuckles]

12:06.026 --> 12:07.759
     Out of what, like 200?

12:07.761 --> 12:09.227
                 Out of 100.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.163
          200 would make your 67
              look even worse.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.832
     You get how that works?
      -Yes, no, thank you.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.166
    I'm not a complete idiot.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.635
       Look, anybody could
  see that this kid's gonna be

12:17.637 --> 12:20.105
       a big star one day.
            -Agreed.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.407
                Which is why
             replacing Art Newly

12:22.409 --> 12:26.311
           will now be a two-man
competition between you and Raj.

12:26.313 --> 12:27.779
       This kid's a hack!
       Are you kidding me?

12:27.781 --> 12:31.649
  I've known sperm on a crusty
 sock with more life experience.

12:31.651 --> 12:32.984
               I'm sorry, Jim.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.520
     The decision's been made --
             far above my head.

12:35.522 --> 12:38.790
             With insistent and
     unwavering support from me.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.726
  I think I speak for Raj when
  I say that neither one of us

12:41.728 --> 12:43.261
         wants any part
         of this thing.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.498
         No.
 No, I'm in -- 100%.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.700
               Et tu, broham?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.938
              Look. You've been
            like a mentor to me.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.607
        Uh-huh. We both know it.
              So there's no way

12:55.609 --> 12:57.542
       I'm gonna let them pit us
             against each other.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.410
   Ah. Excellent.
Y-Y-You gonna bow out, then?

12:59.412 --> 13:02.080
  No, I just think we should try
  our best and see what happens.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.681
Hey, "F" that, all right?
      "F" that.

13:03.683 --> 13:06.485
Look, I know this has been
a dream of both of ours
for a very long time.

13:06.487 --> 13:08.687
   A dream. That's really funny.
               No, not really.

13:08.689 --> 13:10.755
        I just did, like, improv
             for a little while,

13:10.757 --> 13:12.557
               and then I took
           a broadcasting class.

13:12.559 --> 13:13.625
                I didn't even
              really finish it.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.927
         I really wanted to call
            G-League basketball,

13:15.929 --> 13:17.695
              but that's, like,
             a hard gig to get.

13:17.697 --> 13:20.031

      So, what was that big idea
to beat Raj you texted me about?

16:00.593 --> 16:02.326
I spent all last night
     looking up

16:02.328 --> 16:04.128
    things people
like on the Internet.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.197
Came up with a lot of videos
  of autistic kids

16:06.199 --> 16:08.733
sinking 3-point baskets,
but, uh, apparently,

16:08.735 --> 16:11.202
  they're very hard
to find on short notice.

16:15.541 --> 16:19.143
And then it hit me, Charles --
Make-A-Wish cancer kids.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.378
     -Oh, Jesus Christ. No.
              -Yes.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.947
Unfortunately, when I called
the Make-A-Wish Foundation,

16:22.949 --> 16:26.017
they informed me that no child
had ever requested a visit

16:26.019 --> 16:27.953
  to a Minor League
Baseball broadcast booth.

16:27.955 --> 16:29.287
              That is so weird!

16:29.289 --> 16:32.423
So I took the liberty of calling
around to local cancer wards

16:32.425 --> 16:35.159
till I came upon the parents
of 8-year-old Dylan Cole,

16:35.161 --> 16:37.195
and I convinced them
 to let him join me

16:37.197 --> 16:38.563

16:38.565 --> 16:40.365
           What exactly is wrong
                 with Dylan?

16:40.367 --> 16:42.901
I don't know. Must be really bad
because his doctors,

16:42.903 --> 16:45.370
they did not want him
to leave the hospital.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.905
   -I won't be a part of this.
   -No, agreed. You know why?

16:47.907 --> 16:49.440
 Apparently, he has
 a lot of equipment

16:49.442 --> 16:50.642
      he needs
to help him breathe,

16:50.644 --> 16:53.244
so there's gonna be no room
for you there in the booth.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.112

to do focus testing.

20:50.283 --> 20:53.083
That third trip to juvie,
  that changed him.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.754
What are you having, hmm?
     I'm buying.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.423
            Yeah, um, I can't be
               your producer,

20:59.425 --> 21:02.026
               your roommate,
              your best friend,

21:02.028 --> 21:04.428
                housekeeper,
             and drinking buddy.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.430
     I know you said I can't say
             their name anymore,

21:06.432 --> 21:09.500
  but I only know one person who
  can match you drink for drink.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.568
       If you want some company,

21:10.570 --> 21:12.970
             I recommend making
           a call to Morristown.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.705
       [Sighs]

21:14.707 --> 21:16.173
 Yeah, you're right.

21:16.175 --> 21:17.775
         [Knock on door]

21:17.777 --> 21:19.110
       Ha ha!

21:19.112 --> 21:21.980
      [Laughs]

21:21.982 --> 21:23.214
        Whoo!

21:23.216 --> 21:25.449
      You know this is not
    who I was talking about.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.851
    There he is.
     Brockmire.

21:27.853 --> 21:30.387
                  Oh, man!

21:30.389 --> 21:31.656
I brought you a present.

21:31.658 --> 21:35.460
                     Oh.
          What are those, mints?

21:35.462 --> 21:37.061
 Horse tranquilizer.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.330
                Ah, you see?
                I missed you.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.865
              Come here. Mwah!

21:48.341 --> 21:49.706
             You're more likable
             when you're drunk.

21:49.708 --> 21:52.676
Those are the words that every
alcoholic longs to be true.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.878
            This is New Orleans.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.613
           Every carnal pleasure
        was invented right here.

21:56.682 --> 21:57.948
        You're a brown Joe Buck.

21:58.017 --> 22:01.085
      Ha ha. No.
Joe Buck is a white me.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.853
    This literally could not
         get any worse.

22:02.922 --> 22:05.288
     Lucy? Okay, it just got
      significantly worse.

22:06.893 --> 22:09.727
This comeback might be over
    before it's begun.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.429
       Ho. We are definitely not
           on the same page

22:12.498 --> 22:13.964
             about how to spend
