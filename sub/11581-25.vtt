00:01.502 --> 00:03.471
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.504 --> 00:06.140
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.174 --> 00:08.442
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.476 --> 00:10.444
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.478 --> 00:11.712
are members of an elite squad

00:11.745 --> 00:13.581
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.184
These are their stories.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.553
Double chai latte,

00:19.587 --> 00:23.023
half-caf, whip cream.
Bathroom this way?

00:24.292 --> 00:26.660
( cell phone rings )

00:28.496 --> 00:31.065
Hold on.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.766
Hello.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.503
The Quarterly Reports
aren't on your desk

00:35.536 --> 00:38.106
because you asked me
to pick them up on my way in.

00:38.139 --> 00:41.342
Not good.
They spiral bound them.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.844
Yes, I know
that makes you crazy.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.746
That's why they're redoing them
as we speak.

00:45.779 --> 00:48.116
I told him, velo binding.

00:48.149 --> 00:51.219
No, I can't hand him the phone.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.686
He said it'd take 20 minutes,

00:52.720 --> 00:54.588
so I ran next door
for a cup of...

00:55.756 --> 00:57.691
Damn it!

00:57.725 --> 01:00.094
Oh!

01:00.128 --> 01:01.762
( groans )

01:05.799 --> 01:08.702
What in the world?

01:08.736 --> 01:12.573
What the hell is this?

01:12.606 --> 01:16.777
MORALES:
Digital CCD,
waterproofed, pinhole lens.

01:16.810 --> 01:17.811
A spy camera.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.880
Taking some candid photos.

01:19.913 --> 01:23.417
Video, actually.
High resolution.

01:23.451 --> 01:24.418
Do you have any idea

01:24.452 --> 01:26.720
how long it's
been in there?

01:26.754 --> 01:29.257
These puppies burn batteries
pretty quickly.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.859
Three, four hours tops.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.761
30% power remaining.

01:33.794 --> 01:37.531
It was set up
less than two hours ago.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.233
So where's the video?

01:39.267 --> 01:42.336
Camera was hooked up
to this micro-transmitter.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.438
Could have been recording
as far as a block away.

01:44.472 --> 01:47.107
Or as close
as the next room.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.911
It's getting way too easy
to invade someone's privacy.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.846
All our guy needed
to do was turn
on his computer

01:52.880 --> 01:53.681
and pick up the signal.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.749
Peeping Toms have gone
high-tech on us.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.386
They used to have go outside
and hide in the bushes.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.154
Now you can
violate somebody

02:00.188 --> 02:02.190
by sitting in front
of a computer

02:02.223 --> 02:03.691
enjoying a cup of coffee.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.159
Which one of them's
a pervert?

02:58.712 --> 02:59.313
Where are we
on the potty perv?

03:00.281 --> 03:01.349
Lab got a thumbprint

03:01.382 --> 03:03.684
off the bottom of the
transmitter, but no matches.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.319
Any of the cafe patrons
looking good?

03:05.353 --> 03:07.588
The ones who'd used the john
just looked freaked out.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.390
TARU searched their
hard drives. Nothing.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.858
Figure our guy
was watching it live,

03:10.891 --> 03:12.260
high-tailed it out of there

03:12.293 --> 03:14.328
when the complaining witness
found the camera.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.630
Gives a whole new meaning
to "live streaming video."

03:16.664 --> 03:18.466
You're either looking
for a urophiliac,

03:18.499 --> 03:20.000
that's a sexual attraction
to urine,

03:20.033 --> 03:21.469
or a coprophiliac, that's...

03:21.502 --> 03:22.603
Okay, let's not go there.

03:22.636 --> 03:23.871
This stuff I just don't get.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.839
These aren't heavily studied
paraphilias,

03:25.873 --> 03:28.476
but they're often the result
of an abusive childhood.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.843
The outside world
is so hostile

03:29.877 --> 03:31.812
that these kids turn
inward on themselves

03:31.845 --> 03:33.914
and they become fixated
by their own bodily functions.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.483
This guy dangerous?

03:35.516 --> 03:37.017
Probably not.
But he's anti-social,

03:37.050 --> 03:38.852
his crime was voyeuristic

03:38.886 --> 03:40.954
and he didn't have any physical
contact with his victims.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.023
We have more calls on this guy
than on the Midtown Rapist,

03:43.056 --> 03:44.725
and I'd like to put him
out of commission.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.894
Maybe we can track him down

03:46.927 --> 03:49.530
through his spy-cam equipment.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.468
MAN:
You name it,
we can put a camera in it.

03:54.502 --> 03:55.803
Alarm clocks, buttons, shoes...

03:55.836 --> 03:57.405
What the hell
would you need a camera

03:57.438 --> 03:58.672
in your shoe for

03:58.706 --> 04:00.541
unless you're going
to look up a girl's dress?

04:00.574 --> 04:03.944
Hey, this is a legit business.
I sell a lot to the Department.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.513
I'm a licensed P.I. myself.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.847
MUNCH:
What's this?

04:09.983 --> 04:11.452
Pedophiles must love this thing.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.754
MAN:
There's a nanny cam
in the left eye.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.856
Who knows how many young lives
this has saved.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.291
We talked to one
of your competitors.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.792
He said he thought
this looked like your work.

04:18.826 --> 04:22.696
Could be. I don't do
the special orders myself.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.831
MUNCH:
Who does?

04:23.864 --> 04:25.833
Charlie. Works in the back.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.635
Parts are from various kits.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.571
No serial numbers,
really no way of tracing it.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.972
Did you put it together?

04:32.005 --> 04:33.641
I do so many custom jobs,

04:33.674 --> 04:35.609
it's really hard
to keep it all straight.

04:35.643 --> 04:38.412
Charlie, unless this is a
cleverly disguised camera,

04:38.446 --> 04:40.648
that information should
be in here, right?

04:40.681 --> 04:42.750
Let me try searching
for an order

04:42.783 --> 04:46.487
using the same various
components, okay?

04:46.520 --> 04:47.921
No... No.

04:47.955 --> 04:51.659
FIN:
How many itty-bitty cameras
could you have made?

04:51.692 --> 04:53.561
In the last year,
about 500.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.530
This one was water-proofed,
so that's gotta narrow it down.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.699
Hey, wait a minute.
This might be something.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.901
Six months ago,
a customer came in

05:00.934 --> 05:02.102
and he ordered five of them.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.404
What's his name?

05:03.437 --> 05:05.639
F.E. Tischman.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.775
Fetish Man.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.777
Fetishmanor.net

05:09.810 --> 05:12.079
Are you in charge here?

05:12.112 --> 05:16.750
I'm production manager.
Gil Tanner. Oh...

05:16.784 --> 05:19.887
Your call was half an hour ago.
Get your asses in there.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.356
Keep your pants on.
We're coming.

05:22.390 --> 05:26.126
Gil, what exactly are you
shooting in there?

05:26.159 --> 05:28.362
Porn. It's perfectly legal.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.664
Broadcast live
over the Internet, 24-7.

05:30.698 --> 05:31.665
Anything goes?

05:31.699 --> 05:33.367
Long as no one gets hurt.

05:33.401 --> 05:36.036
We supply the models,
you direct the action.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.705
We got more positions
than the Kama Sutra.

05:37.738 --> 05:38.939
You must have
a lot of cameras

05:38.972 --> 05:40.040
to catch all
those angles.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.108
Closed set.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.711
Yeah. House has over a hundred.

05:43.744 --> 05:44.845
Including five toilet cams

05:44.878 --> 05:46.447
There's only one
in the bowl itself.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.616
Our heavy hits are in
the showers and the hot tubs.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.584
WOMAN ( over radio ):
Gil, we got a situation

05:50.618 --> 05:51.985
with the Chinese
spinning basket.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.587
Copy, I'm on it.
Gotta go.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.523
Hey, Gil,
you ever shoot on location?

05:55.556 --> 05:57.425
Like, say
a coffee house?

05:57.458 --> 05:59.560
Why? We've got a one-stop fetish
shop right here.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.094
It's an effin' cash cow.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.731
So all of your toilet cam's
are accounted for, huh?

06:03.764 --> 06:05.065
Believe me,

06:05.098 --> 06:06.867
I'd be the first to know
if that website went dark.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.636
Feel free to check it out.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.105
Can you believe this?

06:12.139 --> 06:14.007
FetishManor.net had
over 300,000 hits?

06:14.041 --> 06:16.076
Casey says we don't have enough
to subpoena

06:16.109 --> 06:17.645
their subscriber list.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.547
No, ma'am, we haven't recovered
any videos yet.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.148
To be honest with you,
I have no idea

06:21.181 --> 06:22.883
how we're gonna identify
the victims.

06:22.916 --> 06:26.119
Liv, Mr. Carson here saw
the video voyeur on the news.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.888
He needs to talk
to somebody about it.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.490
I take it you used
the facility

06:29.523 --> 06:30.724
at the cafe
yesterday.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.025
No. I work in the
building next door.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.661
He believes he might
have run into our perp.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.162
A gentleman with a laptop.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.764
Where?
On the sidewalk.

06:36.797 --> 06:37.898
I was getting out of a taxi

06:37.931 --> 06:39.900
and this guy practically knocked
me over getting into it.

06:39.933 --> 06:40.901
What time?
8:30.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.504
How do you know
he was coming from the cafe?

06:43.537 --> 06:45.639
I recognized their logo
on the coffee cup

06:45.673 --> 06:47.107
which he spilled
all over me.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.509
Okay. Can you describe him?

06:48.542 --> 06:49.877
White, late 20s,

06:49.910 --> 06:52.646
dark hair, about my height,
wore glasses.

06:52.680 --> 06:53.781
Are you on an
expense account?

06:53.814 --> 06:55.015
Yeah, why?

06:55.048 --> 06:56.183
Your receipt
can tell us
the cab number.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.051
The dispatcher
should be able
to tell us

06:58.085 --> 06:59.653
where he dropped him off.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.558
BENSON:
We're looking for a geek.

07:04.592 --> 07:05.659
He carries a laptop.

07:05.693 --> 07:06.994
I don't know his name,

07:07.027 --> 07:09.530
It sounds like someone
I've seen in the building.

07:09.563 --> 07:10.898
Do you know
which apartment?

07:10.931 --> 07:14.201
First door on the right.
That'd be 1-A.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.203
1-A is Donato.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.572
Do you know
anything else about him?

07:18.606 --> 07:21.208
Just that he creeps me out.
Never makes eye contact.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.443
Just stares at people's asses.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.981
Mr. Donato!

07:30.684 --> 07:31.852
TV's on. Somebody's home.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.220
If there's any
poetic justice,

07:33.253 --> 07:34.788
we caught him
in the bathroom.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.957
Hey, if it isn't Charlie
the spy girl.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.592
You know her?

07:38.626 --> 07:40.594
She's the technician
from the camera shop.

07:40.628 --> 07:41.595
What do you want now?

07:41.629 --> 07:42.863
Let's take another crack

07:42.896 --> 07:44.832
at who you made
that toilet cam for.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.067
Here's a clue:
he lives in this apartment.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.201
It's my baby brother, Wade.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.003
You live together?

07:50.037 --> 07:52.272
Actually, he has trouble
holding down a job

07:52.305 --> 07:55.042
and he asked if he
could spend a few
weeks on my couch

07:55.075 --> 07:56.577
and it turned
into two years.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.645
Now there's sisterly love.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.647
Free room and board
and surveillance equipment.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.514
Look, you guys.
This is my fault.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.583
I should never have
made it for him.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.184
You knew that
he was a pervert.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.953
He's not.
He's just troubled.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.021
I've always had
to look out for him.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.658
We didn't have a pleasant
childhood, all right?

08:10.691 --> 08:11.959
You seem to be
high-functioning.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.861
Wade took the brunt
of the abuse.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.295
He's a very sensitive boy.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.764
I think the people
he caught

08:16.797 --> 08:18.632
with their pants down
might disagree.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.868
This where the
little peeper
keeps his stuff?

08:20.901 --> 08:23.571
Please don't.
Wade doesn't want anyone
touching his things.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.572
Just a peek.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.573
No!
Charlie...

08:25.606 --> 08:27.174
your brother is sick.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.810
You're not doing him any favors.

08:29.843 --> 08:30.711
Help us stop him

08:30.744 --> 08:33.847
so we can get him
the counseling he needs.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.656
BENSON:
"Ur-ine Luck"?

08:42.690 --> 08:44.324
MUNCH:
Must've been good,
they're sequels.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.660
What are you doing?

08:46.694 --> 08:49.296
Admiring your
video collection.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.732
Wade, these are
detectives. They know.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.066
I didn't break any laws.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.835
BENSON:
You did if you
took any of these

08:54.868 --> 08:57.671
without the subject's consent.

08:57.705 --> 09:01.008
Now, uh, these look
homemade, Wade.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.209
I can explain.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.577
MUNCH:
Let's come back
to our place.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.178
You're going
to love our facilities.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.718
Seriously, Wade,
just tell me.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.252
What do you get out of it?

09:12.285 --> 09:13.887
I really don't feel
like discussing it.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.023
Wade, I've gotta commend you
on your fine penmanship.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.758
Our friend here's been keeping
a journal

09:17.791 --> 09:20.093
detailing his toilet tour
of Manhattan.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.795
You had no right
to read that.

09:21.829 --> 09:23.631
You had no right
to shoot the crap.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.198
The witness you ran over
fleeing from the scene

09:25.232 --> 09:26.867
of the crime
positively I.D.'d you.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.201
That's how we got
our search warrant.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.071
I can't stand people
touching my things.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.006
You get anything
off his computer?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.975
Footage from the cafe, yeah.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.977
Oh. Did he write about it
in his journal?

09:37.010 --> 09:39.880
Try May second,
8:05 A.M.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.048
Please don't do this.

09:41.081 --> 09:45.619
"Female subject,
fat butt, urination,
33-second duration,

09:45.653 --> 09:46.954
Marigold yellow."

09:46.987 --> 09:48.656
I wasn't hurting anyone.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.758
You violated hundreds of people.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.259
The videos
were for my own private use.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.027
No one else
was ever going to see them.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.696
Just let me pay the fine
so I can go.

09:55.729 --> 09:56.964
Doesn't work
that way anymore.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.799
They passed
Stephanie's Law in August.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.333
Video voyeurism
is now an "E" Felony.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.035
You're looking
at one to four years.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.637
Per count.
No way.

10:03.671 --> 10:04.838
Oh, yeah. You serve those
consecutively,

10:04.872 --> 10:05.906
you're looking
at a life sentence.

10:11.712 --> 10:12.680
I wanna make a deal.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.148
Unfortunately,
you don't have
anything we want.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.383
No, I do. A real crime.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.852
Yeah? What is it?

10:18.886 --> 10:22.389
If you catch the guy,
will you reduce
my sentence?

10:22.422 --> 10:25.659
It depends.
What have you got?

10:27.861 --> 10:30.630
Check out DVD 62,
about an hour in.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.268
MUNCH:
This is from two weeks ago.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.070
STABLER:
Saturday, 1:00 P.M.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.907
I'll spare you the details.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.174
Next one's three minutes
after this.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.175
It's marked "N.S."

10:42.209 --> 10:44.044
What's N.S.?

10:44.077 --> 10:46.046
No specimen.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.681
Here we go.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.788
FIN:
Oh, no.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.024
Not a kid.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.759
BENSON:
Check out his right eye.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.761
Looks like he's been attacked.

11:00.794 --> 11:01.795
CRAGEN:
Recently.

11:01.829 --> 11:04.297
Maybe he ran in there
to hide.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.433
Look, the door's shaking.

11:06.466 --> 11:09.069
Someone must've followed him in.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.437
FIN:
Don't open the door.

11:28.321 --> 11:31.058
Camera's going out.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.427
Toilet Perv caught
a sexual assault.

11:34.461 --> 11:37.297
And didn't do a thing
to stop it.

11:44.304 --> 11:47.007
You watched that boy
being molested.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.109
What are you doing?

11:49.142 --> 11:51.244
Where were you?
Where were you?

11:51.278 --> 11:53.881
( gagging ):
I don't know what
you're talking about.

11:56.083 --> 11:59.219
You were standing
right outside--
No.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.288
Watching.
No, no, I
saw it later.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.523
Wade, don't lie to me.
That's not your M.O.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.125
You like a live show.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.427
You saw that whole thing
go down--

12:07.460 --> 12:09.429
you didn't even help?

12:09.462 --> 12:11.031
What was I supposed to do?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.299
Help him!

12:12.332 --> 12:13.901
Yeah, and tell the cops

12:13.934 --> 12:16.937
that I caught the whole thing
on my toilet cam?

12:19.206 --> 12:22.442
Where did it happen?

12:22.475 --> 12:26.113
Central Park.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.916
The camera didn't catch
the guy's face.

12:28.949 --> 12:29.917
Describe him.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.018
I was on a bench

12:31.051 --> 12:34.154
50 yards away.
I never saw him.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.493
MAN:
Can't get what's not there.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.930
All we have is the perp's blue
sweatshirt and jeans.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.164
FIN:
What about the boy?

12:44.197 --> 12:46.466
We'll never get an ID,
it's too grainy.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.402
We have some new technology
on loan from NASA.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.104
Let's see what it can do.

12:51.138 --> 12:54.808
Software's a video image
stabilization system

12:54.842 --> 12:56.309
called VISAR.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.511
MUNCH:
That's what they used to solve
that car wash abduction

12:58.545 --> 12:59.512
down in Florida.

12:59.546 --> 13:00.547
FIN:
That's amazing.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.350
You can see just how fresh
the cut over his eye is.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.918
Not to mention eye color--
blue.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.086
I'll print it
out for you.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.955
Hold on, hold on.
Pull back out.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.890
There's a section that we
kept replaying.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.125
We couldn't quite
make it out.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.861
Right there.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.830
Go back a few frames.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.832
Zoom in.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.934
There's something
in the perp's hand.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.103
Can you enhance it?

13:23.136 --> 13:25.873
FIN:
That's an athletic cup.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.208
He must have been playing
some kind of sport in the park.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.609
He's wearing
a soccer jersey.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.178
That explains the cut
over his eye.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.013
Probably got injured
during the game.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.414
Which the pedophile
may have been watching.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.884
Guys, we've got
something else.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.118
What?

13:38.151 --> 13:39.586
The nails are
manicured.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.254
Tips are white.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.823
Our molester's a woman.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.062
Well, that certainly narrows
the suspect pool.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.964
Only ten percent of all
pedophiles are female.

13:50.998 --> 13:51.999
MUNCH:
That we know of.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.266
It's definitely understudied

13:53.300 --> 13:54.534
and probably under-reported.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.603
Patrol had a walk
in the park that day.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.538
No one reported
so much as a mugging.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.440
Which bathroom
are we talking about?

14:00.473 --> 14:02.943
Wade says it was close
to the Boathouse Cafe.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.544
Nearest facility is
Mid-Town here.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.114
There's a lot of practice
fields in that area.

14:07.147 --> 14:10.317
His journal says the attack
occurred around 1:03 p.m.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.152
I checked
the team schedules.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.520
Closest field reserved
for a soccer

14:13.553 --> 14:17.157
was Vipers versus Bulldogs.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.026
The boy's jersey was
red and black.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.994
It's the Bulldogs.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.163
Talk to their coach.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.332
MAN:
That's Shane Madden--
our star forward.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.567
Anything unusual happen
at that game?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.903
Yeah, we were actually
winning for once.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.238
Till Shane
got thrown out.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.439
For what?

14:32.472 --> 14:34.074
Fighting with the
other team's sweeper.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.508
Any adults
get involved?

14:35.542 --> 14:37.244
Shane's mom ran
onto the field.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.478
Real piece of work.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.379
How so?

14:39.412 --> 14:41.648
She's got a little
too much team spirit...

14:41.681 --> 14:42.916
in the liquid form.

14:42.950 --> 14:43.984
So she was drunk?

14:44.017 --> 14:45.418
She wasn't feeling
any pain.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.154
Not even when she
fell on her ass.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.555
Trying to break up
the fight?

14:48.588 --> 14:49.689
No, joining in.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.491
She assaulted
a kid?

14:51.524 --> 14:52.559
Verbally.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.094
She slipped in the mud

14:54.127 --> 14:55.929
before she could reach him.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.565
Then she teetered off
to clean herself up.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.167
I assume to the
nearest restroom.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.334
How long after
all of that

15:01.368 --> 15:02.970
did Shane leave?

15:03.003 --> 15:05.105
Right away.
Never came back.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.474
BENSON:
Any other women leave the game
around that time?

15:07.507 --> 15:08.575
Not that I noticed.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.311
What school
does Shane go to?

15:11.344 --> 15:14.481
( playing marching music )

15:16.516 --> 15:18.251
Trumpet section,
last chair on the right.

15:21.021 --> 15:24.224
You notice any behavioral
changes in the last two weeks?

15:24.257 --> 15:25.959
I don't have that much
interaction with him.

15:25.993 --> 15:28.228
Shane's a good student.
Only the problem cases

15:28.261 --> 15:29.596
get sent to
the principal's office.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.965
We're going to need to speak
to his homeroom teacher.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.633
Fred Moynihan.
Room 109.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.502
BENSON:
Is there a place
where we can speak

15:35.535 --> 15:37.370
to Shane privately?

15:37.404 --> 15:39.272
You're welcome
to use my office.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.108
Go ahead and pull
him out, please.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.443
I don't know what
you're talking about.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.378
Shane, it was
caught on tape.

15:45.412 --> 15:48.381
There was a hidden camera
in the bathroom.

15:48.415 --> 15:51.684
It wasn't me.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.688
Someone who looks
just like you.

15:57.624 --> 16:01.294
Even wearing
your jersey.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.529
Who was it?

16:02.562 --> 16:06.166
Was it a stranger,
or was it someone you know?

16:11.771 --> 16:13.173
A stranger.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.441
BENSON:
Can you describe her?

16:14.474 --> 16:16.309
Why? I thought you had
a picture of her.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.344
STABLER:
We do.

16:17.377 --> 16:18.611
We just need you to tell us

16:18.645 --> 16:20.480
anything you can
remember about her.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.751
You know what, I really
don't want to do this.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.486
BENSON:
Shane...

16:26.519 --> 16:28.188
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.489
You didn't do
anything wrong.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.193
You guys suck.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.066
What happened?

16:39.099 --> 16:41.468
We're going to need
to talk to his parents.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.203
Well, there's just a mother.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.537
I use the term loosely.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.673
STABLER:
So you know about
her problem.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.276
She came to speak
to the kids on Career Day.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.111
It was horrible.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.213
Great lesson on the perils
of drinking, though.

16:53.246 --> 16:56.216
What exactly is
Mrs. Madden's career?

16:56.249 --> 16:57.217
A beautician.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.751
She works at a place

16:58.785 --> 17:01.221
called Creme De La Crop.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.159
The little girls just love him.
They call him all the time.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.628
Ma'am, do you understand
what happened to your son?

17:08.661 --> 17:11.431
He's a gorgeous kid,
just like his father.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.366
Girls couldn't keep their
hands off him either.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.568
We're talking
about an adult.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.338
Who would do
something like that?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.640
We understand that you
had a little mishap at the game.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.242
Some idiot knocked me
in a mud puddle.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.376
Where's you go
to clean yourself up?

17:23.410 --> 17:24.444
Bathroom.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.545
Happen to run
into your son there?

17:25.578 --> 17:26.613
No.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.381
Would you mind if we took
a look at your nails?

17:28.415 --> 17:30.483
Why?

17:30.517 --> 17:32.152
What the hell
are you implying?

17:32.185 --> 17:34.354
Just that you both were in
the restroom at the same time.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.788
I used the one at
the Boathouse Cafe

17:35.822 --> 17:37.624
and then stayed for a drink.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.192
How long were you there for?

17:39.226 --> 17:40.393
Let's see,

17:40.427 --> 17:42.195
I was just finishing
my second beverage

17:42.229 --> 17:43.596
when Shane came
and pulled me out.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.565
Did he say anything about
what had happened?

17:45.598 --> 17:47.734
No, but who talks about
sex with their mother?

17:47.767 --> 17:49.536
Did you notice any
female spectators

17:49.569 --> 17:50.637
that didn't have
a son there?

17:50.670 --> 17:51.638
Cindy Bellamy.

17:51.671 --> 17:52.639
BENSON:
And who's that?

17:52.672 --> 17:53.806
Shane's baby-sitter,
until about a month ago.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.543
Used to just love her, but one
day ups and throws a fit.

17:56.576 --> 17:57.744
Says he doesn't need
her anymore.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.846
What was she doing there?

17:59.879 --> 18:02.315
I have no idea.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.319
I went to more of Shane's games
than his own mom.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.155
While I was there,
I networked a little,

18:08.188 --> 18:09.189
picked up three other gigs.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.358
So you were baby-sitting
another kid that day.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.392
Yeah, Davey Auerbach.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.226
Come on, Alex, Dylan,

18:13.260 --> 18:16.196
five-minute time out.
Separate rooms.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.630
Come on.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.732
MUNCH:
Got quite a way
with the boys there.

18:19.766 --> 18:24.671
Yeah, I'm strict, but I always
make sure they have fun.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.873
And $12.50 an hour
is nothing to sneeze at.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.676
Shame you were fired
from that Madden gig.

18:29.709 --> 18:32.179
Shane said he was too old
for a baby-sitter.

18:32.212 --> 18:35.882
FIN:
But too young
for a girlfriend.

18:35.915 --> 18:38.218
I'd never do that
to a kid.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.620
I'm dating one
of my professors.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.921
I like 'em older.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.323
Now if you'll
excuse me.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.857
Did you talk
to Shane at that game?

18:44.891 --> 18:45.992
Yeah.

18:46.025 --> 18:48.561
I asked if things had gotten
any better with him mom.

18:48.595 --> 18:49.762
MUNCH:
There was a problem?

18:49.796 --> 18:50.830
She's a total alchie.

18:50.863 --> 18:54.401
Heard she was really knockin'
'em back at that game.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.703
I can't tell you how many times
I was baby-sitting,

18:56.736 --> 18:57.970
she showed up hours late,
blotto.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.873
Lot of times with a younger guy
than the one she left with.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.309
Must be rough on Shane.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.943
God knows what
he's seen.

19:03.976 --> 19:09.182
When she's drunk, Mrs. Madden
has no idea what she's doing.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.717
We're seriously looking
at the mother?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.919
She was in the vicinity
at the time of the attack.

19:12.952 --> 19:13.986
Witnesses say
she was drunk.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.589
And when she drinks she gets
horny for younger guys.

19:16.623 --> 19:17.857
When I was on the bottle,

19:17.890 --> 19:20.493
I woke up with my share
of regrettable bedmates,

19:20.527 --> 19:21.428
but her own son?

19:21.461 --> 19:23.930
The more you drink,
the blinder you get.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.333
And her alcoholic
blackouts are legend.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.668
We canvassed the building--
Everybody had a horror story.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.203
Like the time she woke up
so drunk

19:30.237 --> 19:31.604
she couldn't find her
own bathroom.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.206
Ended up pounding
on a neighbor's door

19:33.240 --> 19:34.407
at 3:00 a.m. asking
to use his.

19:34.441 --> 19:35.542
Naked.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.776
So at the very least,

19:36.809 --> 19:38.745
we're looking at
an unfit mother.

19:38.778 --> 19:39.912
Where's the father?

19:39.946 --> 19:41.681
Baby-sitter said
he split years ago.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.783
Apparently, Shane took over
some of his duties.

19:43.816 --> 19:44.884
Okay, but in the bedroom?

19:44.917 --> 19:46.619
You know how big
a role alcohol plays

19:46.653 --> 19:47.987
in sexual assaults.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.589
Before we stagger
down this road,

19:49.622 --> 19:51.424
let's not rule out
other possibilities.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.859
Shane's team has
a game tomorrow.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.527
Well, it should be
the same crowd.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.297
Chat up the cheering section,
see if anybody saw anything.

19:59.799 --> 20:03.636
Check out the redhead--
blue sweatshirt and jeans.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.238
Just like the perp
in the video.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.673
Ma'am?

20:06.706 --> 20:07.807
Yes?

20:07.840 --> 20:09.242
"Soccer Mom."

20:09.276 --> 20:10.310
That's what it says.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.444
You got a boy
on the team?

20:11.478 --> 20:12.512
Do you?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.981
No, but we'd like to talk
to you about your outfit.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.015
What about it?

20:16.048 --> 20:17.984
Did you wear it
to the game
two weeks ago?

20:18.017 --> 20:19.218
I wear it
to all the games.

20:19.252 --> 20:22.522
The booster club pushes them
to pay for the pizza parties.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.357
Every mom in the league's
got one.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.494
Of course I bought a shirt.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.861
Got to support
my little man!

20:28.895 --> 20:30.797
Hey-ya!

20:30.830 --> 20:33.466
Probably appreciate it
a little more if
you were sober.

20:33.500 --> 20:36.303
Screw you.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.338
Ma'am, have you
been drinking?

20:38.371 --> 20:39.238
No.

20:39.272 --> 20:42.642
No? Mind if I examine
your travel cup?

20:42.675 --> 20:44.544
Oops.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.314
Mrs. Madden, you're in
violation of Code 10-125,

20:47.347 --> 20:48.948
and we could arrest
you right now.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.318
MRS. MADDEN:
What do you want from me?

20:51.351 --> 20:52.885
Is this a school team?

20:52.919 --> 20:55.555
No, it's sponsored
through the city.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.590
Shane's principal,
Ms. Rice--

20:57.624 --> 20:58.925
she have a son
on the team?

20:58.958 --> 21:00.327
MRS. MADDEN:
No.

21:02.762 --> 21:03.730
What's she doing here?

21:03.763 --> 21:05.264
Awful close
to the student body.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.638
She's awful popular
around here.

21:11.671 --> 21:15.442
Looks like she has a thing
for young boys in uniform.

21:22.949 --> 21:23.916
Principal Rice.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.752
Hey, good to
see you again.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.919
Detectives.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.455
STABLER:
Who's this young man?

21:28.488 --> 21:29.489
Jason.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.523
My son.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.459
Really? You look
way too young

21:32.492 --> 21:33.893
to have a son this age.

21:33.926 --> 21:34.994
Stepson.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.162
His team just won.

21:36.195 --> 21:38.798
Congratulations.
Does he play in the same
league as Shane?

21:38.831 --> 21:41.701
Jason's 14.
He's in an older division.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.870
But the same league.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.073
Where's your
"Soccer Mom" shirt?

21:47.106 --> 21:50.076
I'm not big on sweatshirts.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.778
What are you
talking about?

21:51.811 --> 21:53.012
You wear that stupid
thing all the time.

21:53.045 --> 21:55.548
Yeah? Your mom come
to all your games?

21:55.582 --> 21:56.949
Oh, yeah.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.818
She's a die-hard soccer fan.
Must be.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.787
We saw you hanging out
at the peewee league.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.922
I ran into a student.

22:02.955 --> 22:04.424
BENSON:
Shane Madden.

22:04.457 --> 22:06.893
You run into him two weeks ago?

22:06.926 --> 22:08.628
No. I'm sorry.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.598
We're late
for a pizza party.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.634
CRAGEN:
What do we know

22:14.667 --> 22:15.668
about the principal?

22:15.702 --> 22:16.969
No criminal record.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.571
Just a lifetime of good deeds:

22:18.605 --> 22:20.640
a stint in the Peace Corps,
volunteer work,

22:20.673 --> 22:22.141
set up an adult literacy
program.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.744
She was I.S. 41's Teacher
of the Year in '96, '98.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.479
Promoted to principal
three years ago.

22:26.513 --> 22:27.780
Nice gig for a pedophile.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.716
Absolute power
over all those kids.

22:29.749 --> 22:32.452
It's just odd that
there's never been so
much as an allegation.

22:32.485 --> 22:33.920
What about her
personal life?

22:33.953 --> 22:36.989
Married seven years
to an architect.
One stepson.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.392
Who happens to be two years
older than the victim.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.761
Most pedophiles
don't get caught
with their first victim.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.162
Maybe she was fooling around
with her stepson.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.831
Easy access.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.132
That's assuming
that she's our perp.

22:46.165 --> 22:47.834
Can we place her
at the game in question?

22:47.867 --> 22:50.437
We just sat through
two riveting hours

22:50.470 --> 22:54.006
of a soccer video
that I wrangled from some dad.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.542
No signs of the principal,

22:55.575 --> 22:58.010
but he did catch Shane's
mom falling on her ass.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.447
The outfit's a crime,
but it's not a match.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.347
Rules her out.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.849
Principal Rice
had to have been there.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.417
Her kid says that she goes
to all his games.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.118
We checked out
where her stepson plays.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.020
The restroom's directly between
the two fields.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.456
That's circumstantial
at best.

23:09.489 --> 23:10.757
Captain, you weren't
there today.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.592
She couldn't get away
from us fast enough.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.661
She never gave us a chance
to find out

23:14.694 --> 23:16.496
what she and Shane
were talking about.

23:16.529 --> 23:17.530
Ask him.

23:17.564 --> 23:18.998
Check out the stepson.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.772
FIN:
How do you get along
with Meredith?

23:25.805 --> 23:26.806
BOY:
Great.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.074
For a step-mom.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.610
For any mom.
I really got lucky with her.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.512
Sounds like you
two are pretty tight.

23:32.545 --> 23:34.781
Well, I was a brat
when she first moved in,

23:34.814 --> 23:36.649
but she's totally cool now.

23:36.683 --> 23:37.617
How so?

23:37.650 --> 23:39.952
She helps with homework,
comes to all my games,

23:39.986 --> 23:42.589
boring school plays,
sappy stuff like that.

23:42.622 --> 23:46.192
( playing scales )

23:46.225 --> 23:48.461
Sounds good.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.797
No, it doesn't.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.632
What are you doing here?

23:52.665 --> 23:53.633
Just checking in.

23:53.666 --> 23:57.169
You always come to school early
to practice?

23:57.203 --> 24:00.072
The noise, it gives
my mom headaches.

24:00.106 --> 24:03.843
I don't think it's your playing
that gives her a headache.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.211
You know, Shane,

24:05.244 --> 24:09.215
I know you've got
a tough situation at home.

24:09.248 --> 24:10.950
My mom, she, uh,

24:10.983 --> 24:12.619
just needs extra help, you know?

24:12.652 --> 24:14.186
She gets sick a lot.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.655
Yeah.

24:15.688 --> 24:18.090
When you feel like talking
to someone,

24:18.124 --> 24:19.859
this is my business card.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.861
You give these people a call.

24:21.894 --> 24:25.097
"Alateen."

24:25.131 --> 24:26.666
What's that?

24:26.699 --> 24:30.102
It's a support group for
children of alcoholics.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.738
Thanks.

24:35.007 --> 24:36.976
Now let's talk about your
situation here at school.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.545
There's no situation.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.079
With Principal Rice.

24:43.750 --> 24:44.884
What about her?

24:45.885 --> 24:48.855
( school bell rings )

24:48.888 --> 24:50.289
I have to get to class.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.858
We have her on tape.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.059
No, you don't.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.927
In that restroom. Yeah, we do.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.132
We talked to her.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.970
Well, she wouldn't say
anything to you.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.577
She has been getting
a little weird lately.

25:10.610 --> 25:11.944
How so?

25:11.978 --> 25:13.846
She and my dad
have been fighting.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.782
That's what
married folks do.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.049
Yeah, but not them.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.885
They never fought before.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.621
I mean, it was
getting really bad, too.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.856
She even yelled at me.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.324
So, what'd you get
from the stepson?

25:25.357 --> 25:27.594
Nothing to indicate
he'd been molested.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.295
What about Shane?
He give her up?

25:29.328 --> 25:30.329
As good as.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.330
I just couldn't get him
to say it.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.332
Not enough to remove
a principal from school.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.935
Which way's the
teacher's lounge?

25:35.968 --> 25:37.269
Meredith Rice?

25:37.303 --> 25:39.171
She's as straight-laced
as they come,

25:39.205 --> 25:40.640
but the kids
still love her.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.909
Do you ever see her interact
with Shane Madden?

25:42.942 --> 25:44.677
Actually, she's pulled him
from my class

25:44.711 --> 25:45.745
a couple of times recently.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.580
For what?

25:47.614 --> 25:50.049
I don't know.
Shane handed me a note
excusing him from gym class.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.618
Tell you the truth,
I thought it was fake.

25:51.651 --> 25:52.652
Why's that?

25:52.685 --> 25:53.920
It looked like
a kid wrote it.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.154
But I double-checked.

25:55.187 --> 25:56.956
Mrs. Rice confirmed
it was her handwriting.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.157
Hey, hey, hey!

25:58.190 --> 25:59.759
( boys arguing )

25:59.792 --> 26:01.327
If Shane Madden passed
through here,

26:01.360 --> 26:02.394
odds are he was written up.

26:02.428 --> 26:05.131
So he'd be there in the
Disciplinary Action File.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.637
Principal Rice didn't write all
of these, did she?

26:10.670 --> 26:11.971
Public school,
lot of at-risk kids.

26:12.004 --> 26:14.774
I mean the handwriting.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.909
Looks like different people
wrote these.

26:16.943 --> 26:19.679
No, Meredith meets
with each one of them.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.318
You're right, she is getting
a little sloppy.

26:26.352 --> 26:27.987
Something weighing on her mind?

26:28.020 --> 26:30.623
She has been
distracted lately,
but aren't we all?

26:30.657 --> 26:32.191
It's so close to summer break.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.960
Nothing on Shane.

26:33.993 --> 26:35.795
Is Principal Rice
available?

26:35.828 --> 26:36.996
Oh, I'm sorry,
she's not back yet.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.364
Where is she?

26:38.397 --> 26:40.032
Home. Family emergency.

26:44.403 --> 26:47.273
STABLER:
Mr. Rice, have you had any
contact with your wife?

26:47.306 --> 26:50.710
Just tell me;
is she in some kind of danger?

26:50.743 --> 26:52.712
One of her problem students?

26:52.745 --> 26:54.280
Mr. Rice, how's
your marriage?

26:54.313 --> 26:56.382
What?
What are you talking about?

26:56.415 --> 26:59.118
We heard you were fighting.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.988
That's none of your business.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.422
Well, actually,
it might be.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.692
At the time that your wife left
school, a young man,

27:05.725 --> 27:07.326
a student also went missing.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.161
You think he kidnapped her?

27:09.195 --> 27:13.632
We think she kidnapped him.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.336
What are you talking about?

27:17.369 --> 27:20.740
Your wife's been molesting
that boy.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.345
That's a lie.

27:26.378 --> 27:30.382
We have it on tape.
I'm sorry.

27:30.416 --> 27:32.284
Have you noticed any
inappropriate behavior

27:32.318 --> 27:34.320
between Meredith
and your son?

27:37.423 --> 27:39.158
Now I've got
a 12-year-old boy

27:39.191 --> 27:40.793
that's in danger
out there

27:40.827 --> 27:44.296
and I need you to tell me
what is going on with your wife.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.298
What is going on
with her?

27:46.332 --> 27:47.867
I don't know.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.669
She's changed.
She's changed, hasn't she?

27:52.104 --> 27:55.441
Yes. Yes.

27:55.474 --> 27:57.810
Please, let me go.

27:57.844 --> 27:59.278
Relax.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.451
She's changed.

28:08.254 --> 28:10.757
She hasn't been
herself lately.

28:10.790 --> 28:14.927
She's preoccupied.

28:14.961 --> 28:16.796
She snaps
at any little thing.

28:16.829 --> 28:18.931
She's...

28:18.965 --> 28:21.500
And in the bedroom...

28:21.533 --> 28:23.069
she's insatiable.

28:26.138 --> 28:31.177
Are you telling me
that she's screw...?

28:31.210 --> 28:32.779
She's not getting enough,

28:32.812 --> 28:35.481
so she's screwing
a little boy on the side?

28:35.514 --> 28:37.416
We just need to find her.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.085
Now do you have any idea
where she might go?

28:39.118 --> 28:40.152
No.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.888
Does she have access
to a car?

28:41.921 --> 28:44.190
We have a car.
We don't use it very often.

28:44.223 --> 28:47.026
Could you check
with the garage?

28:47.059 --> 28:49.461
I got 911'd out
of my VICAP meeting.

28:49.495 --> 28:50.763
We got a cluster?

28:50.797 --> 28:51.864
Shane Madden went missing.

28:51.898 --> 28:52.999
As did Principal Rice.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.266
We're thinking
they're together.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.835
Yeah, and getting the
hell out of Dodge.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.436
Husband hasn't heard from her,
and she took his car.

28:57.469 --> 28:58.437
Long gone by now.

28:58.470 --> 28:59.438
You get out an APB?

28:59.471 --> 29:00.807
And an Amber alert.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.108
And unfortunately,
the blue Ford Taurus

29:02.141 --> 29:03.175
is a very popular make
and model.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.177
We're getting possible sightings
from every highway

29:05.211 --> 29:06.478
in the tri-state area.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.547
She's gotta stop for food
and gas at some point.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.249
You tracking her ATM
and credit cards?

29:10.282 --> 29:11.818
So far, no pops.

29:11.851 --> 29:14.020
She's either using cash
or Shane's piggy bank.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.421
Husband said the tank
was near empty.

29:15.454 --> 29:16.889
We got a sighting.

29:16.923 --> 29:18.157
Where?
Edgewater, New Jersey.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.159
Trucker's right behind them
on the exit.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.527
That's just outside
the city.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.929
How sure is he it's them?

29:22.962 --> 29:24.130
He gave me
the full plate number.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.865
Get moving.

29:32.171 --> 29:35.207
Out of the vehicle!
Move in!

29:35.241 --> 29:36.242
Shane!

29:36.275 --> 29:37.243
Backseat!

29:37.276 --> 29:38.277
Shane!

29:38.310 --> 29:39.278
Help! Help!

29:39.311 --> 29:41.280
Mrs. Rice,
exit the vehicle.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.115
Hands where
we can see 'em!

29:43.149 --> 29:44.250
Go away!

29:44.283 --> 29:45.952
You need to comply now.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.519
You okay?

29:47.553 --> 29:50.322
I'm fine, but she's not.
She's been throwing up.

29:50.356 --> 29:51.824
Please don't let
them hurt her.

29:51.858 --> 29:52.959
Come on.
Let's go.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.027
She's sick! She's sick!

29:55.061 --> 29:57.529
You're under arrest
for sexual assault

29:57.563 --> 29:58.831
and kidnapping
of a minor.

29:58.865 --> 30:01.267
You have the right
to remain silent.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.135
If you give up
that right,
anything you say

30:03.169 --> 30:05.204
can and will be
used against you
in a court of law.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.442
My head is splitting.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.044
I think I need a doctor.

30:12.078 --> 30:14.380
STABLER:
We've got a great company
shrink you can see.

30:14.413 --> 30:15.447
You got to be
out of your mind

30:15.481 --> 30:16.582
to be running off
with a sixth-grader.

30:16.615 --> 30:19.285
I am not crazy.
I know it's wrong.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.087
Good.
Taking responsibility--

30:21.120 --> 30:23.189
it's the first step
to setting it right.

30:23.222 --> 30:24.423
Look, you don't
understand.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.158
That day at
the soccer field

30:26.192 --> 30:27.526
was the first time.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.395
So help me understand
what happened.

30:29.428 --> 30:30.496
He was crying.

30:30.529 --> 30:33.065
I followed him in there
to make sure he was okay.

30:33.099 --> 30:35.567
The next thing I know
we're having sex.

30:35.601 --> 30:38.537
And that seems like

30:38.570 --> 30:40.372
a perfectly natural segue
for you?

30:40.406 --> 30:41.573
Yes.

30:41.607 --> 30:42.909
You didn't notice that Shane
was fighting

30:42.942 --> 30:43.976
to get away from you?

30:44.010 --> 30:45.244
The first time.

30:45.277 --> 30:47.279
But after that
he couldn't get enough.

30:47.313 --> 30:48.480
It was his idea to run.

30:48.514 --> 30:51.617
You always take orders
from sixth-graders?

30:53.953 --> 30:56.455
My life is falling apart
and I don't know why.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.324
Look, what are you
going to do?

30:58.357 --> 31:01.894
You're obviously attracted
to young boys.

31:01.928 --> 31:03.462
This is a nightmare.

31:03.495 --> 31:06.398
I swear, I have never
done anything like this before.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.067
What, been caught?
Well, you have-- on tape,

31:08.100 --> 31:09.568
and now you got
to deal with it.

31:09.601 --> 31:11.237
I am not a pedophile.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.505
I love my husband.
I love my job.

31:13.539 --> 31:14.373
I bet you do.

31:14.406 --> 31:16.075
A lot of young boys
to choose from.

31:16.108 --> 31:17.343
Stop it.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.145
Tell me what you did
to the child.

31:23.115 --> 31:24.583
That's a bad idea.

31:24.616 --> 31:26.185
Come on, let's get it on.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.520
Are you crazy?
You're out of your mind.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.391
Is there a problem here?

31:32.424 --> 31:33.559
No problem.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.494
I think she's going for
an insanity defense.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.663
( gasping )

31:37.696 --> 31:39.265
She's having a seizure.

31:39.298 --> 31:40.466
Call an ambulance.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.974
BENSON:
The tox screen is clean.

31:48.007 --> 31:49.308
They're still waiting
for the head CT.

31:49.341 --> 31:52.011
Olivia, I don't even know
what the hell happened.

31:52.044 --> 31:53.645
It was an accident.
She assaulted you

31:53.679 --> 31:55.381
and you have
witnesses, Elliot.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.616
Rat squad IAB
at two o'clock.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.085
Sergeant Tucker.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.186
Detective Stabler.

32:00.219 --> 32:01.420
Sorry to interrupt
your beauty sleep,

32:01.453 --> 32:02.688
but I'll be waiting
for my union rep.

32:02.721 --> 32:05.357
Smart move.
If you got
something to hide.

32:05.391 --> 32:06.725
He was sexually
assaulted.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.228
What a surprise, the partner's
going to back him up.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.129
Yeah? How
would you feel

32:10.162 --> 32:12.264
if some perp had your boys
in a vice grip?

32:12.298 --> 32:14.500
Cuff her.
Not bash her brains in.

32:14.533 --> 32:17.069
I thought I used
appropriate force.

32:17.103 --> 32:19.171
I was just reading up
about your thoughts.

32:19.205 --> 32:22.041
Suspended four years ago
for telling the company shrink

32:22.074 --> 32:25.711
you dreamed about
killing pedophiles.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.680
Thought about it,
never did it.

32:28.714 --> 32:33.719
You're getting closer
and closer.

32:33.752 --> 32:35.754
MAN:
Detectives?

32:35.787 --> 32:37.189
How is she?

32:37.223 --> 32:38.357
Not good.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.591
We found something
on her CT.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.393
They're rushing her
into surgery right now.

32:41.427 --> 32:43.029
From a blow to the head?

32:43.062 --> 32:45.297
No. This was
a preexisting
condition.

32:45.331 --> 32:48.367
Brain tumor the size
of a baseball.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.271
We were in there eight hours.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.472
Looks like we got it all.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.007
Great. Now here's my problem.

32:55.041 --> 32:56.742
The law says she needs
to be arraigned

32:56.775 --> 32:58.310
within 24 hours
of her arrest.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.379
I just opened up
this woman's skull

33:00.412 --> 33:03.482
and excised a malignant lesion
nine centimeters long.

33:03.515 --> 33:06.185
I'm afraid you're going
to miss that deadline.

33:06.218 --> 33:07.219
I've gotten an abeyance,

33:07.253 --> 33:09.355
but I still need
to proceed in a timely manner.

33:09.388 --> 33:10.622
She'll be in the hospital
five, six days.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.358
That's fine.

33:12.391 --> 33:13.659
I can get a judge and clerk
down here

33:13.692 --> 33:15.261
for a bedside arraignment.

33:15.294 --> 33:18.164
I wasn't aware
that judges made house calls.

33:18.197 --> 33:21.500
Just tell me when she'll
be lucid enough
to be swearable.

33:21.533 --> 33:24.736
May I ask what exactly
is she charged with?

33:24.770 --> 33:26.672
She molested a 12-year-old,

33:26.705 --> 33:29.208
whom she subsequently kidnapped.

33:30.776 --> 33:32.744
You do know that
frontal lobe damage

33:32.778 --> 33:34.513
can diminish impulse control.

33:34.546 --> 33:37.349
This woman knew what
she was doing was wrong.

33:37.383 --> 33:38.617
That's right.

33:38.650 --> 33:41.653
The area of the brain that
stores moral knowledge

33:41.687 --> 33:43.522
is not affected,

33:43.555 --> 33:45.424
but look at this.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.294
This is Meredith's head CT.

33:48.327 --> 33:51.263
The tumor is here in the right
orbitofrontal cortex,

33:51.297 --> 33:53.199
which controls behavior.

33:53.232 --> 33:54.433
That's fascinating,

33:54.466 --> 33:55.767
but I'm not performing
brain surgery here.

33:55.801 --> 33:58.404
I'm just trying to get
a pedophile off the streets.

33:58.437 --> 34:01.573
Without the tumor,
she might not be one anymore.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.410
So what, give her
a doctor's note?

34:04.443 --> 34:06.478
"Please excuse Meredith
for molesting boys,

34:06.512 --> 34:07.546
she had a bad tumor."

34:07.579 --> 34:08.647
To tell you the truth,

34:08.680 --> 34:11.417
this looks like a textbook
case of acquired sociopathy.

34:11.450 --> 34:12.684
How do I know
the tumor caused it?

34:12.718 --> 34:14.353
Maybe she's been
a predator all along,

34:14.386 --> 34:15.721
and the tumor
just made her sloppy.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.823
I doubt it.
Shane is our only known victim.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.525
Not as of
this morning.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.693
Three additional boys
have come forward.

34:21.727 --> 34:22.694
Raped?

34:22.728 --> 34:25.131
One boy sent to her office
was hugged and kissed.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.298
The other two
were fondled.

34:26.332 --> 34:27.433
When?

34:27.466 --> 34:28.600
All in the last month.

34:28.634 --> 34:30.536
She committed multiple
felonies, she has to
pay for them.

34:30.569 --> 34:31.837
Not if she lacked the mens rea.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.872
It's obvious the lesion
disinhibited her.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.574
The question you have
to answer is,

34:35.607 --> 34:38.310
did she act on those pedophilic
tendencies before the tumor?

34:38.344 --> 34:41.647
And are those tendencies
still there?

34:41.680 --> 34:45.184
Understand, this test
is still in the
experimental stages.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.119
So we'll be viewing
her PET Scan in here

34:47.153 --> 34:50.456
while she's viewing
the erotic videos
on those goggles.

34:50.489 --> 34:53.259
Yeah, brain mapping is not
an exact science yet,

34:53.292 --> 34:54.793
but we do know
the areas of the brain

34:54.826 --> 34:56.862
that respond to arousal
and pleasure.

34:56.895 --> 35:00.166
And we'll be able
to view activity on
the anterior cingulate.

35:00.199 --> 35:01.867
Trust me, you won't.

35:01.900 --> 35:04.770
I no longer have those feelings.

35:04.803 --> 35:07.439
What is that, exactly?

35:07.473 --> 35:10.176
It's a very tiny amount
of radiation...

35:10.209 --> 35:14.346
the same exposure you'd get
flying across country
five times.

35:16.382 --> 35:17.916
We're good to go.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.718
How are you feeling?

35:19.751 --> 35:21.520
Like my old self again.

35:21.553 --> 35:25.157
Well, we really appreciate
your cooperation.

35:25.191 --> 35:26.392
I want to do this.

35:26.425 --> 35:28.327
Hopefully, this test
will give us
some answers.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.629
Please...

35:30.662 --> 35:34.533
believe me, I tried to stop.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.236
Did you?

35:37.269 --> 35:39.471
I knew it was wrong,

35:39.505 --> 35:43.209
but the urges were so strong,

35:43.242 --> 35:45.777
that they just took over
my mind, my body...

35:45.811 --> 35:47.679
I couldn't control myself.

35:47.713 --> 35:51.583
Every day it got worse.

35:51.617 --> 35:56.154
I am the last person
who would ever do
anything like this.

35:58.424 --> 35:59.658
Why?

36:02.561 --> 36:05.163
I know the damage it can cause.

36:13.972 --> 36:16.542
When did it happen
to you?

36:20.846 --> 36:23.749
It started when I was eight.

36:23.782 --> 36:24.950
Lasted four years.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.822
With someone
that you knew?

36:32.658 --> 36:34.826
Someone I loved.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.264
My grandfather.

36:41.333 --> 36:42.868
DOCTOR:
Ready?

37:00.452 --> 37:02.588
STABLER:
So that's a pedophile's
brain, huh?

37:02.621 --> 37:03.622
No, this is.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.624
One who's
currently incarcerated.

37:05.657 --> 37:08.026
According to Meredith Rice's
PET Scan,

37:08.059 --> 37:09.928
she's no longer a threat
to society.

37:09.961 --> 37:10.962
She showed no reaction

37:10.996 --> 37:13.265
to the pedophilic
stimuli.

37:13.299 --> 37:15.934
If she had, the area
right in here would be red.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.604
Unless it meets the Daubert test
for scientific reliability,

37:18.637 --> 37:19.838
it's not admissible in court.

37:19.871 --> 37:21.039
Well, look at the handwriting.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.608
I mean, it went right back
to normal

37:22.641 --> 37:23.875
as soon as the tumor
was removed.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.445
So what do we do?
We let her go?

37:26.478 --> 37:27.646
No, if we let her off,

37:27.679 --> 37:29.915
it opens the door for every
rapist and violent criminal

37:29.948 --> 37:31.583
to find some medical excuse.

37:31.617 --> 37:34.320
Yeah, tomorrow
there'll be a run
on the PET Scan lab.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.654
Wouldn't it be great
if that was true?

37:35.687 --> 37:37.356
If they could isolate the part
of the brain

37:37.389 --> 37:38.824
that makes somebody a pedophile?

37:38.857 --> 37:40.292
And they could be fixed.

37:40.326 --> 37:41.993
STABLER:
How? Mandatory
screenings at birth

37:42.027 --> 37:44.463
to zap some part
of the brain we
don't know exists?

37:44.496 --> 37:45.864
A tumor changed her behavior,

37:45.897 --> 37:47.933
but that alone didn't
make her a pedophile.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.302
She had a lower set point
to begin with.

37:50.336 --> 37:51.703
NOVAK:
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

37:51.737 --> 37:53.405
She was molested
as a child.

37:53.439 --> 37:55.407
And like having
any predisposition

37:55.441 --> 37:57.609
to high blood pressure
or cholesterol,

37:57.643 --> 37:59.511
she had a higher risk
of becoming an offender.

37:59.545 --> 38:00.712
But she never acted on it

38:00.746 --> 38:02.914
until the tumor wiped out
her impulse control.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.717
I found a similar case
in Virginia.

38:05.751 --> 38:08.354
Upstanding citizen,
loving husband and father,

38:08.387 --> 38:10.456
became a pedophile
out of the blue.

38:10.489 --> 38:11.923
Let me guess--
same brain tumor.

38:11.957 --> 38:12.891
It was discovered in jail.

38:12.924 --> 38:15.026
It was removed
and he was considered cured.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.528
BENSON:
They release him?

38:16.562 --> 38:17.763
Yeah.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.598
A year later,
he molested again.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.567
So it wasn't
the tumor at all.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.101
No, it was the tumor.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.103
It had just grown back.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.473
So, it's not her fault
and she's perfectly cured.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.475
But if the lesion recurs,
she'll do it again.

38:29.508 --> 38:32.310
What are you going to do,
Counselor?

38:38.650 --> 38:41.086
NOVAK:
She pleads to Rape Three,
five years probation,

38:41.119 --> 38:43.822
and periodic psychiatric
and medical evaluations.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.023
We might be amenable
to that.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.758
I'm not done yet.

38:46.792 --> 38:49.928
She's also not to have future
contact with her victims.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.029
Of course not.

38:51.062 --> 38:53.499
There are already
restraining orders
in place.

38:53.532 --> 38:54.633
We're not
contesting them.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.768
And she registers
as a sex offender.

38:56.802 --> 38:58.804
What?

38:58.837 --> 39:01.407
Come on, Casey, is that
really necessary?

39:01.440 --> 39:02.674
NOVAK:
Yes.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.910
The registry was set up
to protect the public

39:04.943 --> 39:07.045
from sexual predators at risk
of offending again.

39:07.078 --> 39:08.514
RICE:
But that's not me.

39:08.547 --> 39:10.649
This only happened
because of the tumor.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.918
NOVAK:
What are you going to do
if it grows back?

39:12.951 --> 39:14.653
She gets branded
a sex offender,

39:14.686 --> 39:17.022
she can never work in
the school system again.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.924
She can never work
with kids.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.859
Better safe than sorry.

39:20.892 --> 39:24.696
Then I think we'll take
our chances at trial.

39:24.730 --> 39:27.733
This is a noble woman
who suffered a freak
brain tumor.

39:27.766 --> 39:30.135
Everyone fears the big C.

39:30.168 --> 39:31.703
Once I remind
the jurors

39:31.737 --> 39:35.040
it could happen to any one
of them, they'll acquit.

39:35.073 --> 39:37.075
RICE:
No.

39:37.108 --> 39:38.444
I'll take the plea.

39:38.477 --> 39:40.045
Meredith, you don't need
to do that.

39:40.078 --> 39:42.113
Yes, I do.
She's right.

39:42.147 --> 39:45.417
The children have
to be protected.

39:45.451 --> 39:48.787
It's a responsibility
I need to take.

39:50.956 --> 39:53.725
( trumpet playing scales )

39:54.726 --> 39:56.828
You're getting pretty good.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.168
Doesn't matter.

40:03.201 --> 40:05.837
I dropped out of band.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.606
And soccer.

40:09.641 --> 40:11.610
If I could,
I'd drop out of school.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.211
Kids giving you a hard time?

40:13.244 --> 40:15.847
Jason Rice slugged me
in the cafeteria.

40:17.516 --> 40:21.853
Said he'd kick my ass
for busting up his family.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.655
He said he'd kill me.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.861
I'll talk to him, okay?

40:31.963 --> 40:33.865
Why won't she talk to me?

40:33.899 --> 40:36.067
I must've called her
a hundred times

40:36.101 --> 40:37.803
and she never picked up.

40:37.836 --> 40:39.137
Shane, she can't.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.673
She goes to jail if she does.

40:41.707 --> 40:44.876
She talked to me.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.745
She cared about me.

40:48.714 --> 40:50.916
I thought she loved me.

40:50.949 --> 40:54.152
Shane, she
was very sick.

40:54.185 --> 40:57.523
What she did is not your fault.

40:58.557 --> 40:59.691
She's better now,

40:59.725 --> 41:02.193
but I gotta to tell you
I'm more concerned about you.

41:05.196 --> 41:07.899
I just wanna die.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.501
( sobbing )

41:09.535 --> 41:11.870
Then we're gonna
get you some help.

41:11.903 --> 41:15.140
Trust me, you're going to get
over this.

41:20.812 --> 41:24.049
The real damage
hasn't even begun
to set in for Shane.

41:24.082 --> 41:25.817
This kid's gonna need
extensive therapy.

41:25.851 --> 41:27.686
And a strong
support system.

41:27.719 --> 41:29.721
Not gonna get that at home.
Not with his mother.

41:29.755 --> 41:32.223
I think she's the reason
why Shane was susceptible

41:32.257 --> 41:33.925
to a mother figure
in the first place.

41:33.959 --> 41:36.094
This kid is so screwed up, he
doesn't even know he's a victim.

41:36.127 --> 41:37.929
He still thinks he's in love
with Meredith.

41:37.963 --> 41:40.165
It's unfortunate his
first sexual experience
was non-consensual,

41:40.198 --> 41:42.768
but it's even worse that
he developed feelings
for his abuser.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.135
BENSON:
What are the odds

41:44.169 --> 41:45.303
that he's going to have
a healthy sex life?

41:45.336 --> 41:46.972
Not good.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.974
But they're ideal that he'll
become an offender himself.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.842
The cycle of abuse
just keep's turning.

41:50.876 --> 41:52.043
BENSON:
So when he grows up,

41:52.077 --> 41:53.679
he's going to have
a low opinion of women

41:53.712 --> 41:55.581
and be able to rationalize
having sex with a child.

41:55.614 --> 41:57.148
How do you stop that
from happening?

41:57.182 --> 41:59.551
HUANG:
I think the answer
lies in Meredith herself.

41:59.585 --> 42:00.786
If she truly wants
to help Shane,

42:00.819 --> 42:01.987
she'd let us study
her brain.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.121
Maybe we really could locate

42:03.154 --> 42:05.991
the part that creates
a pedophile, and then fix it.

42:06.024 --> 42:08.293
Meredith Rice hasn't changed.

42:08.326 --> 42:11.062
Patrol just responded
to an incident at her address.

42:11.096 --> 42:13.298
OFFICER:
My partner's with the victim.

42:13.331 --> 42:14.766
She took a pretty bad beating.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.267
She gone after
another boy?

42:16.301 --> 42:17.302
This one fought back.

42:17.335 --> 42:20.038
You got it backwards.
There's no boy involved.

42:20.071 --> 42:21.873
So who
attacked her?

42:21.907 --> 42:23.775
You heard the woman.

42:23.809 --> 42:25.276
she's not pressing charges;
I am.

42:25.310 --> 42:26.978
Mrs. Madden,
what happened here?

42:27.012 --> 42:30.048
That perverted bitch
is still chasing my little boy.

42:30.081 --> 42:32.183
Is that true?
I can explain.

42:32.217 --> 42:35.086
Tell it to the judge.
She broke her restraining order.
I want her arrested.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.788
What did she do?
She called Shane

42:36.822 --> 42:38.089
in my home.

42:38.123 --> 42:40.125
Thank God, I happened
to pick up the extension.

42:40.158 --> 42:41.192
What's wrong with you?

42:41.226 --> 42:42.327
Everything.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.062
And you think
the best person

42:44.095 --> 42:45.931
to commiserate with is
your 12-year-old victim?

42:45.964 --> 42:47.666
That's not why I called him.

42:47.699 --> 42:48.800
MRS. MADDEN:
Tell them!

42:48.834 --> 42:50.268
Tell them why
you called Shane!

42:50.301 --> 42:52.203
It doesn't matter
why she called him.

42:52.237 --> 42:54.239
You broke one
of the conditions
of your probation.

42:54.272 --> 42:56.341
Which means
you're under arrest.

42:56.374 --> 42:58.043
I thought he had a right
to know.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.210
Know what?

42:59.244 --> 43:00.679
I'm pregnant.

43:00.712 --> 43:02.113
And I did agonize,

43:02.147 --> 43:04.349
but I felt like
he needed to know.

43:04.382 --> 43:06.918
He is the father.

43:06.952 --> 43:08.954
She's having my baby's baby.

43:08.987 --> 43:10.321
STABLER:
Let's go.

43:10.355 --> 43:13.358
I want it terminated.

43:13.391 --> 43:15.093
That's not your
decision, ma'am.

43:15.126 --> 43:17.362
You have no say over
her reproductive rights.

43:17.395 --> 43:19.030
You didn't need to lay this
on that little boy.

43:19.064 --> 43:20.265
What were you doing?

43:20.298 --> 43:21.700
I don't know.

43:21.733 --> 43:23.101
My husband's
leaving me,

43:23.134 --> 43:24.970
my stepson won't
even talk to me...

43:25.003 --> 43:28.039
I've lost my home,
my job...

43:28.073 --> 43:30.308
The irony is, all I've
ever wanted

43:30.341 --> 43:31.910
is a baby of my own.

43:31.943 --> 43:35.380
Be careful what you wish for,
huh?

44:08.479 --> 44:10.782
( wolf howling )
