"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

00:05.471 --> 00:08.508
{\an8}We ain't got no income...

00:05.471 --> 00:08.508
{\an8}You just gotta chill sometime.

00:08.575 --> 00:11.478
{\an8}I told you I got it.
I could have a potential
situation with a major.

00:11.544 --> 00:13.780
{\an7}You know what I'm saying,
I gotta get out this situation
with Harry first, though.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.782
{\an7}I believe you gonna
make it happen.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.417
{\an7}Is it possible
to give me a release?

00:17.484 --> 00:19.953
{\an7}That's gonna be a hard position
to get to for us.

00:21.388 --> 00:23.056
{\an7}I have my line
coming out.

00:23.123 --> 00:25.725
{\an8}Me and Nikki, we're getting
ready for the fashion show.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.595
{\an7}I've been doing
research on lipo.

00:28.661 --> 00:30.697
{\an8}Lipo?

00:28.661 --> 00:30.697
{\an7}Yes.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.399
{\an7}Do you understand
that this is gonna be

00:32.465 --> 00:35.034
{\an8}a very complicated
love relationship?

00:35.101 --> 00:36.703
{\an8}I'm aware.

00:35.101 --> 00:36.703
{\an8}Okay, I feel better.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.004
{\an7}'Cause I didn't want you
to be blind.

00:38.071 --> 00:39.272
{\an8}All I can do is try.

00:39.339 --> 00:40.874
{\an8}Get your ass
into the courtroom,

00:40.940 --> 00:44.711
{\an8}get full custody
and let her pay you
and go hire a nanny.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.813
{\an8}You have never cared!

00:46.880 --> 00:48.882
{\an8}Not until yesterday
did I get a glimpse

00:48.948 --> 00:50.917
{\an7}that you did not have
a support system.

00:50.984 --> 00:54.020
{\an7}Your mom told me yesterday
to take you to court.

00:54.087 --> 00:58.124
{\an7}I've had feelings of attraction
towards the same sex.

00:58.191 --> 01:01.027
{\an8}And I've been
in a relationship.

01:01.094 --> 01:03.163
{\an8}You have some things
to tell me?

01:03.229 --> 01:04.397
{\an8}(Miles on phone)
<i>I've been with Milan.</i>

01:04.464 --> 01:06.332
{\an8}It's three sides
to a story--

01:06.399 --> 01:10.003
{\an8}my side, Milan's side,
and the (bleep) truth.

01:10.069 --> 01:11.471
{\an8}And I'm gonna
let you know right now,

01:11.538 --> 01:14.207
{\an7}I'm gonna get to the bottom
of this, without you.

When Amber reached out and asked
if she could come see me,

02:04.290 --> 02:06.159
I figured Miles must have
finally told her about us.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.394
Miles has been calling
and texting for weeks,

02:08.461 --> 02:10.263
but we haven't spoken
since I kicked him out.

02:14.501 --> 02:16.936
I can't even think about
taking Miles back right now.

02:17.003 --> 02:18.838
I need to get some answers
from this woman

02:18.905 --> 02:21.875
{\an5}so she can explain to me
why they're such a big part
of each other's lives.

02:21.941 --> 02:24.277
{\an8}Their relationship has always
been a problem for me.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.713
{\an5}What's up?

02:24.344 --> 02:26.713
{\an1}So, um...

02:26.779 --> 02:29.883
{\an1}obviously, you know that we have
some things to talk about.

02:29.949 --> 02:32.919
{\an1}And, you know,
I do want to hear

02:32.986 --> 02:35.688
{\an1}maybe some things that
you would like to tell me.

02:35.755 --> 02:37.991
{\an1}'Cause I kinda already
got a, you know,

02:38.057 --> 02:40.627
{\an1}a little taste of
what's been going on.

02:40.693 --> 02:42.962
He obviously told you
that he was gay

02:43.029 --> 02:44.764
or whatever it is
that he told you.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.267
And, um, I don't know if
you know that me and Miles

02:47.333 --> 02:49.536
{\an1}have been in a relationship
for, like, two years.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.840
{\an5}Yeah.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.840
Two years?

02:53.907 --> 02:54.941
(Amber)
Two years?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.509
{\an8}That means Miles
broke up with me

02:56.576 --> 02:58.177
{\an8}to pursue this relationship.

02:58.244 --> 02:59.846
First he tells me
he was gay,

02:59.913 --> 03:01.948
now I find out
he's with Milan,

03:02.015 --> 03:03.950
and now it's two years.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.785
I'm more hurt than anything.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.755
{\an1}I don't-- I'm just lost
in this situation.

03:08.821 --> 03:12.859
I just want to know from you
what's going on, that's it.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.395
{\an4}Every time I've asked
Miles about you, it's,
"Oh, that's my best friend."

03:15.461 --> 03:17.196
{\an5}I'm like, well,
you need to tell her.

03:15.461 --> 03:17.196
{\an1}Good.

03:17.263 --> 03:20.466
{\an5}I've been telling
Miles from day one,
"I want to talk to Amber."

03:20.533 --> 03:23.269
{\an5}I mean, I just want
to know, like, what
y'all relationship is.

03:23.336 --> 03:25.538
Like, what is it, like,
currently, right now?

03:25.605 --> 03:27.373
What is he to you?

03:27.440 --> 03:29.075
{\an1}You know, we have Zoey,
she's my child,

03:29.142 --> 03:31.878
{\an4}but, you know,
he's been there for her
since her dad passed away,

03:31.945 --> 03:33.446
{\an1}so you know he calls me
all the time.

03:33.513 --> 03:36.249
{\an1}I don't know what
he tells you about that.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.718
{\an4}I don't know what
he tells you when he
begs to come to my house.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.653
{\an1}I don't know what he tells you
about those things.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.922
{\an1}I don't know what else
to say to you,

03:42.989 --> 03:44.457
{\an1}but I do want
to let you know,

03:44.524 --> 03:46.793
{\an1}all those things
that have been going on,

03:46.859 --> 03:49.329
{\an1}all he does is
lie to me about you.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.064
{\an1}He told me
you're his homeboy.

03:51.130 --> 03:53.266
From my point of view,
I want you to understand

03:53.333 --> 03:55.635
{\an1}that he tells me that you are,
like, latching onto him,

03:55.702 --> 03:57.070
you won't let go,

03:57.136 --> 03:59.772
he's been trying to, like,
distance himself from you.

03:59.839 --> 04:02.875
{\an1}Um, like, he's not in love
with you, he's in love with me.

04:02.942 --> 04:04.744
He wants to be with me.
He wants to marry me.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.646
{\an5}He wants to--

04:04.811 --> 04:06.646
So he asked you to marry him?

04:06.713 --> 04:08.615
I mean, we've talked
about being married.

04:08.681 --> 04:09.983
He hasn't asked me
to marry him,

04:10.049 --> 04:13.152
but at the same time,
we have matching tattoos.

04:13.219 --> 04:15.455
{\an5}You know,
he moved into my house.

04:13.219 --> 04:15.455
{\an1}Oh.

04:15.521 --> 04:17.490
You know, I do
everything for him.

04:17.557 --> 04:19.392
He does what he can,
you know what I mean?

04:19.459 --> 04:22.428
{\an1}You do everything for him?
Like what?

04:22.495 --> 04:25.298
The car he drives.
His school.

04:25.365 --> 04:26.499
You know, just--

04:26.566 --> 04:28.267
You must have paid my rent
a couple times, too, huh?

04:28.334 --> 04:29.435
I have paid you rent twice.

04:29.502 --> 04:31.270
{\an1}Thank you, I really
appreciate that.

04:31.337 --> 04:33.072
{\an1}I didn't know
it was coming from you.

04:33.139 --> 04:36.009
{\an5}(Amber) I really thought
Miles was self-sufficient
and making his own money.

04:36.075 --> 04:37.543
And now I'm starting
to question

04:37.610 --> 04:39.946
all the times I was in a pinch
and he helped me with Zoey.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.248
It's like I don't even know
this man anymore.

04:42.315 --> 04:45.451
{\an1}I just want you to know that
I apologize if you think that...

04:45.518 --> 04:49.055
that I was doing
anything malicious to you

04:49.122 --> 04:51.624
or anything vindictive
or being deceitful

04:51.691 --> 04:53.559
{\an1}or anything like that,
because I really did not know.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.563
{\an5}(Milan)
Standing here looking
in Amber's eyes,

04:57.630 --> 04:59.399
I can't help
but feel sorry for her.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.501
I can see she was still
holding on to some type of hope

05:01.567 --> 05:03.236
that her and Miles would
eventually be together.

05:03.302 --> 05:05.071
And I understand that
it can't be easy finding out

05:05.138 --> 05:06.806
that what me and Miles
has is real.

05:06.873 --> 05:08.141
But at the same time,

05:08.207 --> 05:10.643
I'm glad Miles told her
because she deserves the truth.

05:10.710 --> 05:13.413
{\an1}The reason why I was upset
with him when it came to you

05:13.479 --> 05:15.581
was because you never
told me about Milan.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.817
{\an1}Trust me, if he would have
told me about you,

05:17.884 --> 05:19.185
{\an1}this wouldn't even
be like this.

05:19.252 --> 05:20.953
{\an1}I probably would be
friends with you guys.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.289
{\an1}We all probably would be
at the club tonight

05:23.356 --> 05:26.092
{\an4}because I'm not gonna
judge him because he wants
to be with a man.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.927
{\an1}That's not--
That ain't me.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.129
I'm not mad at Miles
for being with another man.

05:30.196 --> 05:33.900
I'm mad that he made me think he
was just working on some (bleep)

05:33.966 --> 05:37.070
and there was a future for us,
because I waited for him.

05:37.136 --> 05:39.272
{\an1}He told you he loved you,
he told me he loved me.

05:39.338 --> 05:40.440
That's wrong.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.442
{\an1}But my thing is,
don't make me a victim.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.343
{\an1}That's all I-- that's only--
that's my concern.

05:44.410 --> 05:45.945
{\an1}That's why I'm here today
to talk to you.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.447
{\an5}Can I have a hug?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.447
Yes, you can.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.382
Because I'm sorry,
I don't want to--

05:49.449 --> 05:51.317
{\an5}I'm sorry, too.

05:49.449 --> 05:51.317
Yes, I'm so sorry.

05:52.785 --> 05:54.754
{\an5}This man...

05:52.785 --> 05:54.754
Is something else.

05:54.821 --> 05:56.155
{\an1}Right, okay.
All right, bye.

05:56.222 --> 05:59.325
{\an5}All right, babe. Bye.

05:56.222 --> 05:59.325

{\an5}(Willie)
Me and my man Omarion,
we play ball every now and then.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.643
{\an8}We're both real competitive, but
it seems like we always end up

06:17.710 --> 06:19.879
{\an8}bumping our gums
more than anything.

06:19.946 --> 06:22.482
{\an1}Yup.
Ooh, come on now.

06:22.548 --> 06:23.850
I don't understand it.

06:23.916 --> 06:25.351
{\an5}(Willie)
I feel like we got
a lot in common.

06:25.418 --> 06:27.453
We both left bands
to pursue solo careers.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.489
And I know he had a season
where he was down.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.858
And I just happen to be dealing
with that season right now.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.860
So maybe I could figure out
what he did in his down time

06:33.926 --> 06:36.095
and hopefully it can help me
get through mine.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.131
{\an1}All in all, it does
come down to one thing.

06:38.197 --> 06:40.867
And that is, you know,
if you had an opportunity,

06:40.933 --> 06:42.268
{\an5}what you gonna do with it?

06:40.933 --> 06:42.268
Exactly.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.003
Like, what's the universe
telling you?

06:44.070 --> 06:46.873
{\an4}Man, I'm currently in
an indie situation.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.873
Okay.

06:46.939 --> 06:49.275
{\an1}Now I just feel like we just
can't-- we reached a bump, man.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.511
{\an5}You know, the budget ran out.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.511
Yeah.

06:51.577 --> 06:54.013
{\an5}Okay, now what we gonna do?

06:51.577 --> 06:54.013
If anybody understands you,

06:54.080 --> 06:56.249
I understand you
the most because

06:56.315 --> 06:59.485
it really took me feeling
like there was no way out

06:59.552 --> 07:03.356
{\an5}because no budgets
were being provided.

06:59.552 --> 07:03.356
Exactly.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.925
{\an5}You know, phone calls
wasn't being picked up,
you know what I mean?

07:05.992 --> 07:07.460
Nobody was really there.

07:07.527 --> 07:09.562
But it's all worth it, man,

07:09.629 --> 07:11.764
when you have
that moment of success.

just like me.

07:14.066 --> 07:17.303
{\an8}With all of the changes and all
of the transitions, you know,

07:17.370 --> 07:19.906
{\an8}it could be tough stepping out
there on your own.

07:19.972 --> 07:23.009
{\an8}Things will get,
you know, tight.

07:19.972 --> 07:23.009

07:24.811 --> 07:26.212

in the game,

07:26.279 --> 07:28.414
they had to go through
the same thing.

07:28.481 --> 07:29.515
{\an5}Exactly. Exactly.

07:28.481 --> 07:29.515
You feel me?

07:29.582 --> 07:31.117
Ain't nobody
spoon-fed around here.

07:31.184 --> 07:34.320
{\an4}When you really successful,
you working your ass off for it.

07:31.184 --> 07:34.320
Yes, indeed.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.155
{\an5}You feel me?

{\an1}Baby, this is the only meal

07:44.697 --> 07:47.033
Okay, so you might
want to save...

you know, Miles was acting up

15:54.620 --> 15:56.021
is hitting her deep.

is mediating a conversation

16:14.973 --> 16:16.642
between the two of them

16:16.709 --> 16:19.044
and hoping that we can
make this right.

So...

16:21.647 --> 16:23.015
last conversation we had,

16:30.122 --> 16:31.857
{\an5}Why?

16:30.122 --> 16:31.857
{\an1}Well...

16:31.924 --> 16:33.392
{\an1}because I want you
and your mom to have

16:33.459 --> 16:35.127
the kind of relationship
that me and my mom have.

16:35.194 --> 16:38.230
{\an8}We're never gonna have
that relationship.

16:35.194 --> 16:38.230

{\an1}I want you to be able
to figure it out.

16:43.135 --> 16:44.470
Of course
I would love--

16:44.536 --> 16:46.171
would have loved,

16:46.238 --> 16:49.508
{\an1}for my mom and I to have a great

but it's a lost cause.

17:25.711 --> 17:26.878
You know, this is
the same bull(bleep)

17:26.944 --> 17:28.380
that I've been dealing with
my whole life

17:28.446 --> 17:29.581

17:29.648 --> 17:31.250
I'm a person
that likes resolve,

17:31.316 --> 17:33.752
so I brought you guys here
to have a conversation.

17:33.819 --> 17:35.687
And I don't know
where it goes

17:35.754 --> 17:37.656
and I don't know,
but hopefully,

17:37.723 --> 17:39.558
let's let the healing begin.

17:39.625 --> 17:40.926
{\an1}Well, first of all,
thanks for calling me,

17:40.993 --> 17:42.694
and it makes sense.

17:42.761 --> 17:44.596
{\an1}And I'm glad that
we are talking,

17:44.663 --> 17:46.932
{\an7}'cause this is the only way
to do it, to talk openly.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.234
{\an7}Did you tell Rich to, like,
run the opp-- go the--

17:49.301 --> 17:51.136
Right, we had
a conversation,

17:51.203 --> 17:54.440
and the (bleep)
left me like...

17:54.506 --> 17:56.909
{\an6}Did that--

17:54.506 --> 17:56.909
When you said--
when you said,

17:56.975 --> 18:00.479
I might have been giving you
an opportunity

18:00.546 --> 18:02.448
to-- to get out of
the situation.

18:02.514 --> 18:05.250
{\an1}Possibly, I mean, that--
I wouldn't put that past me.

18:05.317 --> 18:07.319
{\an1}That's all I wanted to know,
so we can move on.

18:07.386 --> 18:08.987
I mean, the overall thing
is this-- I just--

18:09.054 --> 18:10.522
{\an5}Can I stop right there, though?

18:09.054 --> 18:10.522
Sure.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.057
That's a-- that's a--

18:12.124 --> 18:14.293
{\an1}The bottom line is
that was all in context of--

18:14.359 --> 18:16.061
{\an1}there's two sides
to every story.

18:16.128 --> 18:19.298
{\an1}It's not just me
protecting Moniece from you,

18:19.364 --> 18:21.433
{\an1}but also, when you're
in a relationship,

18:21.500 --> 18:24.236
{\an1}you deserve to know both sides
of what's going on.

18:24.303 --> 18:25.504
Why don't we talk
about custody?

18:25.571 --> 18:27.973
What Drew said to me
was that

18:28.040 --> 18:29.875
she suggested

18:29.942 --> 18:33.846
he go back to court
and take full custody.

18:33.912 --> 18:35.948
{\an5}Let me say--

18:33.912 --> 18:35.948
Please, no, tell me--
tell me your account.

18:36.014 --> 18:37.683
{\an1}I'm going to,
but let me start the way--

18:37.749 --> 18:39.685
{\an5}No, tell me your account.

18:37.749 --> 18:39.685
Moniece, I have no--

18:39.751 --> 18:42.888
{\an5}What's the benefit that
I would want to help you
lose custody of Kameron?

18:42.955 --> 18:46.024
{\an1}And furthermore,
because I know how hard it is,

18:46.091 --> 18:48.227
{\an1}I've been
your biggest cheerleader.

18:50.395 --> 18:52.831
When you had that baby,
you and I sat together,

18:52.898 --> 18:54.633
{\an1}and you know what
I said to you?

18:54.700 --> 18:55.968
I'm gonna remind you.

18:56.034 --> 18:59.738
{\an1}I said, "Moniece, no matter
what it is that you have to do,

18:59.805 --> 19:03.175
{\an1}if you decide to be a mother
to Kameron full time,

19:03.242 --> 19:04.376
you have my support.

19:04.443 --> 19:06.745
{\an1}It's the biggest
and hardest job on the planet,

19:06.812 --> 19:09.147
because I've done it.

19:09.214 --> 19:11.483
You chose something else.

19:11.550 --> 19:12.684
That's all up to you.

19:12.751 --> 19:14.920
{\an1}And the thing about it is,
even still,

19:14.987 --> 19:16.822
we try to be there for you.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.757
{\an1}So it's preposterous for you
to think that I would

19:18.824 --> 19:21.126
{\an1}gang up with Drew
against you.

19:21.193 --> 19:22.694
(Marla)
I know it sounded harsh,

19:22.761 --> 19:25.097
but I have Moniece's
best interest at heart.

19:25.163 --> 19:26.832
What Moniece
can't do on her own,

19:26.899 --> 19:29.601
to step up and take
responsibility for Kameron,

19:29.668 --> 19:31.637
maybe going to court

19:31.703 --> 19:34.540
will inspire her
in some kind of way

19:34.606 --> 19:38.143
to take more responsibility
for her son, period.

19:38.210 --> 19:42.681
{\an1}You choose-- because I'm
the closest person to you--

19:42.748 --> 19:46.518
{\an5}to make me the enemy and if--

19:42.748 --> 19:46.518
I don't choose to
make you an enemy, Mom.

19:46.585 --> 19:49.087
{\an1}Moniece, whatever you need,
I will support that.

19:49.154 --> 19:51.356
{\an1}There are plenty of times
where I feel like you haven't

19:51.423 --> 19:52.691
had my best interest
at heart.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.793
Who are you to tell me

19:54.860 --> 19:57.262
I'm... a bad parent?

19:57.329 --> 19:58.430
That's how I feel.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.132
I feel like
you judge me,

20:00.198 --> 20:02.701
{\an1}you criticize me for making
some of the decisions

20:02.768 --> 20:04.136
that I've made as a parent.

20:04.202 --> 20:07.272
But maybe if you'd made some
of the same decisions I made,

20:07.339 --> 20:10.042
{\an1}maybe I would have turned out
a little bit differently.

20:10.108 --> 20:11.777
(Moniece)
My mom picked up,

20:11.843 --> 20:14.913
ran off with me,
married my stepdad.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.648
Never have I heard
my mother acknowledge

20:16.715 --> 20:19.251
how those decisions
may have actually been

20:19.318 --> 20:20.986
emotionally damaging to me.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.922
I went above and beyond,
most importantly,

20:23.989 --> 20:26.692
which she didn't do,
to make sure

20:26.758 --> 20:28.994
that I did everything
in my power

20:29.061 --> 20:31.897
to have a positive
relationship with Drew

20:31.964 --> 20:33.832
from the very beginning.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.068
{\an1}If this is how you perceive,
it's real to you.

20:36.134 --> 20:37.803
And I apologize.

20:39.338 --> 20:41.740
{\an1}If you don't think I was there
for you, that's hurtful.

for where you are emotionally.

20:44.943 --> 20:48.714
{\an4}And say, if there's anything
I can do for you going forward,
let me know.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.649
I just feel like

20:50.716 --> 20:54.586
I would like to live

Okay, so don't even
worry about a thing.

23:01.346 --> 23:04.583
{\an7}So when your skin is good and
it's elastic like a rubber band,

23:04.649 --> 23:06.718
I can go lipo it, all over,

23:06.785 --> 23:09.755
and it's gonna stick smooth and
nice and have that nice contour.

23:09.821 --> 23:11.490

27:42.460 --> 27:44.496

27:44.562 --> 27:46.031
{\an1}Like, we let (bleep)
get in between us

27:46.097 --> 27:47.899
{\an1}and make us
have issues that

27:47.966 --> 27:50.168

have to be that way.

her problems with Princess,

27:58.977 --> 28:01.579
that doesn't mean that I can't
see what she's all about

28:01.646 --> 28:04.049

about our business.

29:35.039 --> 29:38.543
take him out to lunch, so we
can celebrate a little bit.

29:39.978 --> 29:41.579
{\an4}Yo.

29:39.978 --> 29:41.579
What up, Shanda?

29:41.646 --> 29:42.747
{\an4}Hey.

29:41.646 --> 29:42.747
{\an3}You good?

29:42.814 --> 29:43.982
{\an4}I'm good.

29:42.814 --> 29:43.982
Good to see you.

29:44.048 --> 29:45.350
{\an1}Y'all done with
the meeting already?

29:45.416 --> 29:49.087
{\an1}I came to take
my boo to lunch.

29:49.154 --> 29:51.256
Yo, your boo
is tripping.

29:51.322 --> 29:52.657
I thought he was gonna
swing on me at one point.

29:52.724 --> 29:54.058
{\an4}On you?

29:52.724 --> 29:54.058
{\an3}Yeah.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.460
{\an5}That's what I'm saying.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.460
{\an1}Really?

29:55.527 --> 29:56.461
What's wrong with him?

29:56.528 --> 29:57.829
{\an8}He's just pissed off

29:57.896 --> 29:59.430
{\an8}'cause he can't get out
that Harry contract.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.801
{\an1}You know, I told him
I'm gonna see what I can do.

30:03.868 --> 30:05.370
(Shanda)
Damn, what the hell?

30:05.436 --> 30:07.872
Willie looked me in my eyes
and lied to me?

30:07.939 --> 30:09.507
Now, that (bleep) hurt.

30:09.574 --> 30:10.909
I thought we were a team

30:10.975 --> 30:12.377
and that we were
in this (bleep) together.

30:12.443 --> 30:14.646
He's in the studio
if you want to go see him.

30:14.712 --> 30:16.347
No, he need his time.

30:16.414 --> 30:17.782
Want me to tell him
you stopped by?

30:17.849 --> 30:19.150
{\an1}No, you don't even
gotta do that.

30:19.217 --> 30:20.285
All right. Okay.

30:20.351 --> 30:22.187
{\an5}Good to see you, though.

30:20.351 --> 30:22.187
{\an3}All right.

30:27.692 --> 30:29.060
{\an8}Our fashion show's
in two weeks.

30:29.127 --> 30:31.062
{\an8}You think you're gonna
be ready to go?

30:31.129 --> 30:34.299
{\an7}I feel like I just
let a bus run me over.

30:34.365 --> 30:37.435
{\an8}I'm just a little worried
'cause we have so much
stuff to get done.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.704
{\an7}I mean, you gotta do what's best
for you at the end of the day.

{\an5}(Nikki)
Teairra's home from
surgery resting up.

30:54.919 --> 30:56.654
She's probably not
feeling too good.

30:56.721 --> 30:59.824
{\an8}Trust me, these things
can be a little bit hard
to bounce back from.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.461
{\an5}Aww.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.461
Oh, my God, T.T.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.263
{\an1}You look like you're really
struggling today, girl.

31:05.330 --> 31:06.598
{\an1}I am.

31:06.664 --> 31:09.334
{\an5}Oh, I feel so bad.

31:06.664 --> 31:09.334
I'm having a hard time.

31:09.400 --> 31:12.337
{\an5}(Nikki)
Seeing Teairra hurting
like this has me worried.

31:12.403 --> 31:13.938
I'm concerned for her
as a friend,

31:14.005 --> 31:16.474
but I'm also nervous about
our fashion show coming up.

31:16.541 --> 31:19.711
It's only two weeks away
and we still have a ton to do.

31:19.777 --> 31:21.946
{\an1}I feel like
I just went and, like,

31:22.013 --> 31:25.583
{\an1}laid down and just
let a bus run me over.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.051
T.T., you just
gotta rest, girl.

31:27.118 --> 31:29.587
{\an5}I brought you some soup.

31:27.118 --> 31:29.587
This better be good.

31:29.654 --> 31:31.623
{\an1}(Bleep),
I'm really hungry.

31:33.358 --> 31:36.127
{\an8}You know, honestly, I was
worried going into surgery,

31:36.194 --> 31:38.863
{\an8}but when I came out,

31:38.930 --> 31:42.867
baby, let me tell you,
I didn't know what I was in for.

31:42.934 --> 31:45.370
They said that it would be
about a week recovery,

31:45.436 --> 31:47.572
but this feels like
it's gonna be

31:47.639 --> 31:50.141
a little longer than that.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.443
{\an1}So, look, our fashion show's
in two weeks.

31:52.510 --> 31:54.612
You think you're
gonna be ready to go?

31:54.679 --> 31:57.382
{\an1}I thought it would be easy,
but it's not.

31:57.448 --> 32:00.551
Like, I've been going to
different pattern makers,

32:00.618 --> 32:02.220
different sewers,

32:02.287 --> 32:05.323
{\an4}like, it's just all been
a clutter(bleep).

32:02.287 --> 32:05.323
Right.

32:05.390 --> 32:07.892
{\an1}So now my dilemma is
just getting the models

32:07.959 --> 32:10.595
{\an5}and getting them fit.

32:07.959 --> 32:10.595
Right.

32:10.662 --> 32:13.231
Have y'all ever actually
ever produced an event?

32:13.298 --> 32:15.433
No.

32:15.500 --> 32:19.170
{\an8}On top of all the intricate
details on just the product,

32:19.237 --> 32:21.673
is there appetizers,
waitresses running around,

32:21.739 --> 32:23.975
is it open bar, closed bar,
you got a liquor sponsor,

32:24.042 --> 32:25.176
{\an5}you know what I'm saying?

32:24.042 --> 32:25.176
Right.

32:25.243 --> 32:26.511
And make a checklist,

32:26.577 --> 32:28.646
divide it up,
see what T is able to do,

32:28.713 --> 32:31.582
{\an5}being that
she's kind of bedridden
in her state right now.

32:31.649 --> 32:35.720
See, what realistically,
you know, you both can...

32:35.787 --> 32:37.922
{\an6}Right.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.922
...commit to.

32:37.989 --> 32:39.357
{\an3}Right.

32:39.424 --> 32:42.627
I gotta admit, I got some
major alarm bells going off.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.662
Teairra is looking
totally beat up

32:44.729 --> 32:46.664
and these girls have no clue
what they're doing

32:46.731 --> 32:48.299
with this fashion show
right now.

32:48.366 --> 32:49.667
{\an5}Bye, boo, get some rest.

32:48.366 --> 32:49.667
{\an3}Bye, T.T.

32:49.734 --> 32:50.835
{\an1}All right,
thank you guys.

32:50.902 --> 32:52.370
Lay down,
take your medicine.

32:52.437 --> 32:55.873
It's clear that they're in over
their heads just a little bit.

32:55.940 --> 32:58.776
And I think they're gonna need
a whole lot of help.

32:58.843 --> 33:00.945
{\an1}So I mean, what do you feel,
like, what's...

33:01.012 --> 33:02.747
I'm just
a little worried,

33:02.814 --> 33:04.615
'cause I don't want her
to be in so much pain

33:04.682 --> 33:06.150
and then knowing
that we just--

33:06.217 --> 33:07.919
we have so much stuff
to get done

33:07.985 --> 33:10.855
{\an1}and it's not like we have like,
months, we have two weeks.

33:10.922 --> 33:13.491
{\an1}I have no problem with
taking what you guys have--

33:13.558 --> 33:17.628
'cause it seems like y'all both
have the individual things done

33:17.695 --> 33:18.796
{\an5}that you need to have done.

33:17.695 --> 33:18.796
Right.

33:18.863 --> 33:20.798
But the big collective event,

33:20.865 --> 33:23.501
{\an1}I don't mind taking on
that responsibility

33:23.568 --> 33:24.869
{\an1}'cause that's what
I'm good at.

33:24.936 --> 33:26.637
{\an4}That's light work to me,
I do that in my sleep.

33:24.936 --> 33:26.637
Okay.

33:26.704 --> 33:28.506
I'm a boss chick
with my own fashion line

33:28.573 --> 33:30.074
and I'm serious
about my business.

33:30.141 --> 33:32.744
However, I've never put together
my own fashion show before.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.512
I'm glad I got someone
like Hazel

33:34.579 --> 33:36.547
who can help me out with
all that kind of stuff.

33:36.614 --> 33:38.383
{\an1}I've been meeting
with Princess.

33:38.449 --> 33:40.752
{\an1}And, you know,
she has her stuff together.

33:40.818 --> 33:42.653
{\an1}She's ready to launch
her swimwear line.

33:42.720 --> 33:46.691
{\an5}We have-- Yeah.

33:42.720 --> 33:46.691
{\an1}No, I saw some of her pieces
and they're dope.

33:46.758 --> 33:49.026
{\an1}If we link up,
we're stronger as a force.

33:49.093 --> 33:50.695
{\an4}We're bigger
as a collective group...

33:49.093 --> 33:50.695
Right.

33:50.762 --> 33:52.063
{\an1}...than each of us
individually,

33:52.130 --> 33:53.631
{\an1}and that's what
the "Inc." stands for.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.700
I just don't ever like to be
in the middle of two people

33:55.767 --> 33:58.503
{\an5}and I did hear about T
and Princess' argument.

33:55.767 --> 33:58.503
{\an1}Yeah.

33:58.569 --> 34:00.204
So that's the only thing
that concerns me,

34:00.271 --> 34:01.606
'cause it's like,
you know...

34:01.672 --> 34:02.807
Last year, you know,

34:02.874 --> 34:05.710
{\an1}when all this Berg and Masika
drama was going on,

34:05.777 --> 34:07.445
Teairra had no problem

34:07.512 --> 34:10.047
with doing her business with
Berg and getting her record,

34:10.114 --> 34:13.117
{\an1}so what's good for the goose
is good for the gander.

34:13.184 --> 34:15.820
{\an4}You can either catch this wave
and get this coin...

34:13.184 --> 34:15.820
Right.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.755
{\an1}...or you could be
a petty bitch and dwell on it.

34:17.822 --> 34:19.857
No, I don't--
Nobody got time for that.

Telling Amber about Milan
over the phone

36:00.525 --> 36:03.127
was not how I wanted to do it,
but she gave me no choice.

36:03.194 --> 36:05.296

she went to see Milan,

36:05.363 --> 36:06.731

37:36.921 --> 37:39.056
And it's okay.

37:39.123 --> 37:40.491
I'm a strong bitch.

37:40.558 --> 37:42.760
{\an1}You just loving
another man,

37:42.827 --> 37:44.362
{\an1}hey, it's love,
that who you love.

37:44.428 --> 37:47.064
{\an1}All right, I--
I cannot judge you on that.

37:47.131 --> 37:50.835
{\an1}But what I can judge you on
is how you did me.

37:50.901 --> 37:53.404
What would you rather me
have done, not tell you?

37:53.471 --> 37:56.540
{\an1}I'd rather you had
came and told me the issue

37:56.607 --> 38:00.411
{\an1}instead of stringing me
along for these many years.

38:00.478 --> 38:02.380
{\an1}I was trying to figure things
out before I even told you.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.515
{\an1}Oh, my God, it's like
a (bleep) broken record.

38:04.582 --> 38:06.183
{\an5}Like, you, like...

38:04.582 --> 38:06.183
Do you think--

38:06.250 --> 38:08.653
Have I ever done anything
to hurt you, ever?

38:08.719 --> 38:11.622
{\an1}Oh!
(chuckling)

38:11.689 --> 38:13.290
{\an1}Have you ever done
anything to hurt me?

38:13.357 --> 38:14.825
Intentionally,
intentionally?

38:14.892 --> 38:16.794
{\an5}I cannot, I can't.

38:14.892 --> 38:16.794
Intentionally?

38:16.861 --> 38:18.596
{\an5}All right, because-- No! No!

38:16.861 --> 38:18.596
You want me to talk or no?

38:18.663 --> 38:20.364
{\an6}Can I talk?

38:18.663 --> 38:20.364
No, you cannot talk.

38:20.431 --> 38:23.300
{\an5}So you're not gonna talk to me?

38:20.431 --> 38:23.300
Nope, I don't want to, Miles.

38:23.367 --> 38:24.935
{\an1}'Cause you just now said,
"intentionally."

38:25.002 --> 38:26.871
{\an1}Have you hurt me
intentionally?

38:26.937 --> 38:29.140
That's dumb!
Of course!

38:29.206 --> 38:31.575
{\an5}Come over here and talk to me.

38:29.206 --> 38:31.575
{\an1}No.

38:31.642 --> 38:33.878
{\an5}(Miles)
I never imagined
my feelings evolving

38:33.944 --> 38:35.246
for Milan like they have.

38:35.312 --> 38:38.082
And not telling Amber
sooner was wrong.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.584
I just hope she gives me
a chance to make things right.

38:40.651 --> 38:44.021
Amber, this (bleep)
has eaten me up.

38:44.088 --> 38:45.690
{\an1}Like, you don't even understand
how hard this (bleep) is.

38:45.756 --> 38:47.925
{\an1}Eating you up?
Or eating me up?

38:47.992 --> 38:51.128
{\an5}Before I even--

38:47.992 --> 38:51.128
{\an1}I'm the one that can't eat.
I'm the one that can't sleep.

38:51.195 --> 38:52.963
{\an1}I'm the one that's going
through it, not you.

38:53.030 --> 38:54.331
In the beginning,
I couldn't either.

38:54.398 --> 38:55.499
That's why I didn't want
to tell you.

38:55.566 --> 38:56.767
I didn't-- I didn't
know what it was.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.602
{\an1}In the beginning,
but now you cool, huh?

38:58.669 --> 39:00.171
Do you know what me
telling you consists of?

39:00.237 --> 39:02.039
{\an1}That's telling you,
that's telling your family,

39:02.106 --> 39:03.774
that's telling my family,
that's telling my mom,

39:03.841 --> 39:06.877
{\an5}that's telling my sisters,
it's a domino effect.

39:03.841 --> 39:06.877
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

39:06.944 --> 39:10.014
So I didn't know
how to deal with that.

39:10.081 --> 39:12.983
{\an4}You didn't handle it right.
You didn't-- you didn't do it.

39:10.081 --> 39:12.983
You're right.

39:13.050 --> 39:14.452
I just want you to know
that I love you.

39:14.518 --> 39:17.388
{\an1}I don't-- I don't--
I never want to lose you, ever.

39:17.455 --> 39:19.824
{\an1}Oh, okay, yeah, we're friends.
I don't hate you.

39:19.890 --> 39:21.559
I just don't (bleep)
with you right now.

39:21.625 --> 39:23.427
Let me get over it.

39:23.494 --> 39:26.230
{\an4}You already know
I'm a boss bitch.
I'm a strong-ass bitch.

39:26.297 --> 39:29.400
{\an4}You already know I'm going
to bounce back so well,
you gonna be mad.

39:29.467 --> 39:30.735
{\an6}I'm sorry.

39:29.467 --> 39:30.735
{\an1}All right.

39:30.801 --> 39:33.070
{\an4}And I want you to understand
why I told you.

39:30.801 --> 39:33.070
Okay. Okay.

39:33.137 --> 39:34.772
Bye, sweetheart.

39:34.839 --> 39:36.373
{\an1}(crying)

39:43.848 --> 39:47.017
{\an8}The road to acceptance
can be a tough one to travel.

39:47.084 --> 39:49.453
{\an8}If you or someone you know

39:49.520 --> 39:51.522
{\an8}is struggling
with who they are

39:51.589 --> 39:54.391
{\an8}or needs support to come out
to friends and family,

39:54.458 --> 39:56.060
{\an8}you're not alone.

39:56.127 --> 39:59.897
{\an8}Please go to
OutInHipHop.VH1.com

39:59.964 --> 40:01.899
{\an8}for resources and support.

40:06.871 --> 40:08.906
{\an8}So you told Amber, huh?

40:06.871 --> 40:08.906
{\an8}I came out to her and told her.

40:08.973 --> 40:10.374
{\an8}If I would have known
what you were doing,

40:10.441 --> 40:12.777
{\an8}I would have been there for you
like I'm always there for you.

40:12.843 --> 40:14.111
{\an8}I'm not here
to argue with you.

40:14.178 --> 40:17.148
{\an8}I'm here to apologize
and say you're right.

40:17.214 --> 40:20.851
{\an8}I talked to Drew
and he wants to meet you.

40:20.918 --> 40:22.353
{\an7}Now I'm starting
to feel a way.

40:22.419 --> 40:24.455
{\an7}Like, I'm not out here
to be interrogated.

40:24.522 --> 40:27.258
{\an7}If it goes left and you decide
to handle it a certain way,

40:27.324 --> 40:30.127
{\an8}then this relationship
is over.

40:30.194 --> 40:33.564
{\an7}This is the biggest record
that I've ever had in my career.

40:33.631 --> 40:36.066
{\an8}But how does the balance
come down, Apryl?

40:36.133 --> 40:38.969
{\an7}I just want to make sure that
I'm still not forgotten.

40:39.036 --> 40:41.839
{\an8}Sharpen up and wait
for your moment.

40:41.906 --> 40:44.041
{\an7}Ain't that my boy
Willie's wife?

40:44.108 --> 40:46.410
{\an8}Shanda? Yeah, she been
working with us.

40:46.477 --> 40:48.445
{\an8}She just started.

40:46.477 --> 40:48.445
{\an8}Yo, stop playing.

40:48.512 --> 40:50.314
{\an8}The fact that you think that
it's okay for you to go dance

40:50.381 --> 40:52.550
{\an8}after I told you that
you shouldn't go do it.

40:50.381 --> 40:52.550
{\an5}I don't give a (bleep).

40:52.616 --> 40:54.018
{\an8}Go do that (bleep)
by yourself, then.

40:54.084 --> 40:55.452
{\an7}What the (bleep)
that supposed to mean?

40:55.519 --> 40:56.754
{\an8}Get the (bleep) out
and do it yourself.

40:56.821 --> 40:58.389
{\an7}Willie, I'm not finna do it
right now with your dumb butt.

40:58.455 --> 40:59.824
{\an8}I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

40:59.890 --> 41:01.492
{\an8}(Bleep) ass (bleep).

41:01.559 --> 41:03.761
{\an8}You disrespect everybody.

41:01.559 --> 41:03.761
{\an8}(Bleep) you.

41:03.828 --> 41:06.430
{\an7}You're a fake-ass bitch.
I (bleep) was your friend.

41:06.497 --> 41:07.798
{\an8}Since when were
you my friend?

41:07.865 --> 41:09.400
{\an7}When you were (bleep)
Berg's (bleep) in the alley.

41:09.466 --> 41:10.601
{\an8}(Bleep) you.

41:10.668 --> 41:12.803
{\an8}I hope you mother(bleep)
die tomorrow.

41:12.870 --> 41:15.206
{\an7}(Bleep) that ho, I don't give
a (bleep) about that bitch.

41:15.272 --> 41:17.541
{\an8}Rest in peace,
Teairra Mari.

41:17.608 --> 41:18.876
{\an9}Good-bye!
