00:48.978 --> 00:53.074
One day in this lousy, stinking penal colony,
and I'm cracking up.

00:53.248 --> 00:57.582
Everyone's so deranged and brutal,
it's frightening. I was so depressed,

00:57.753 --> 01:00.586
- I saw the social worker.
- Was he any help?

01:00.756 --> 01:03.350
Not really. He beat me up.

01:03.525 --> 01:07.985
He said I was a whining nancy boy
with girly white legs,

01:08.163 --> 01:13.465
then pummelled me repeatedly with his book
"Showing Compassion to Inmates".

01:13.635 --> 01:17.765
- Social workers are supposed to be nice.
- I was so shellshocked,

01:17.940 --> 01:21.000
- I told the priest everything.
- What did he say?

01:21.176 --> 01:25.135
He said I was a whining baby
who was missing his mum.

01:25.314 --> 01:27.908
Then he beat me up, too.

01:28.083 --> 01:31.678
You can still see the crucifix marks
in the back of my head.

01:31.854 --> 01:35.085
It's 'cause we're in G tower.
The staff are mad here.

01:35.257 --> 01:40.661
One guy said as a reward for good behaviour,
they move you to the luxury block on D wing.

01:40.829 --> 01:46.358
It's nice there. They even shampoo the rats -
groom their tails and everything.

01:46.535 --> 01:50.369
I must look it up
in my "Michelin Guide to Penal Hellholes".

01:50.539 --> 01:53.599
I'm sure it gets the full five slop-out buckets.

01:53.776 --> 01:58.042
They've got TVs, music centres.
They've even got a trouser press.

01:59.114 --> 02:02.345
Since when were you interested
in a trouser press?

02:02.518 --> 02:07.478
You care less about your appearance
than a member of the Dutch Royal Family.

02:07.656 --> 02:10.989
No, if we got moved to a cell
with a trouser press,

02:11.160 --> 02:13.924
we could make cheese toasties.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.299

"If privacy is required when using toilet,
please wear blindfold."

02:29.878 --> 02:31.869
What's the book?

02:32.047 --> 02:33.674
"Gideon's Bible."

02:33.849 --> 02:36.249
He follows me everywhere, that bloke.

02:36.418 --> 02:40.149
I was staying in a hotel once -
he left his bible there as well.

02:40.322 --> 02:44.554
Two years later, another hotel,
dozy git left it behind again.

02:44.726 --> 02:46.353
(SIGHS)

02:46.528 --> 02:51.056
Everything is ruined. My career's over.
I've no goal, no hope, no life.

02:51.233 --> 02:54.225
How come that's starting to get you down now?

02:54.937 --> 02:59.806
We're gonna spend two years in the brig.
Two years with the scum of the universe -

02:59.975 --> 03:04.435
hardened criminals, deranged droids -
people so unbalanced and debauched,

03:04.613 --> 03:09.641
they couldn't even get elected as president
of the United States. We have to escape.

03:09.818 --> 03:13.083
There's security cameras everywhere.

03:13.255 --> 03:17.692
That mad geezer with the one eye
and the funny tick said it was impossible.

03:17.860 --> 03:21.159
He's bound to say that, he was the warden.

03:21.964 --> 03:27.869
If only I'd hired a smarter lawyer instead of the
brain-dead, pompous, stupid-haired git I got.

03:28.070 --> 03:29.833
You defended yourself.

03:34.910 --> 03:38.607
Yes, and I don't need reminding of that,
thank you very much.

03:39.681 --> 03:43.845
- Two years in the Tank.
- Two years.

03:50.792 --> 03:53.124
How did I get into this mess?

03:53.295 --> 03:56.196
I think the blindfold's supposed to be for me.

04:03.472 --> 04:07.704
This is the diary of Captain F. Hollister
of the mining ship Red Dwarf.

04:07.876 --> 04:12.472
Several crew members are being tried
for crimes against the Space Corps.

04:12.648 --> 04:17.244
- Are you familiar with the mind scan?
- We are familiar with the mind scan, sir.

04:17.418 --> 04:19.579
It will involve the administration

04:19.755 --> 04:25.057
of psychotropic drugs which affect
your mental state, making this process possible.

04:25.227 --> 04:27.593
If you accept, say "Aye".

04:27.763 --> 04:30.561
- (ALL) Aye.
- Sign the consent forms,

04:30.766 --> 04:33.530
and seal them into the envelopes provided.

04:34.736 --> 04:36.795
We reconvene at 10 a.m. Tomorrow.

04:39.474 --> 04:44.537
To test the veracity of their defence,
I've had them placed in artificial reality

04:44.713 --> 04:47.238
where their actions can be observed.

04:47.416 --> 04:50.408
(FUNKY MUSIC)

04:52.921 --> 04:55.481
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

05:04.099 --> 05:09.901
Right now, they believe they're escaping,
but we just want to observe what they do.

05:10.072 --> 05:14.668
So that means that if anyone happens
to mention any special agreements

05:14.843 --> 05:19.837
that they've entered into... Can you excuse me?
I think I've left the iron on.

05:22.084 --> 05:24.746
Rimmer, one of the least able of my crew...

05:31.460 --> 05:36.397
...is acting very suspiciously,
being incredibly insightful and efficient.

05:38.867 --> 05:42.769
I suspect he may have access
to the crew's confidential files.

05:42.938 --> 05:45.270
We also believe he may possess a virus

05:45.440 --> 05:49.274
which makes him incredibly attractive
to the opposite sex.

05:49.444 --> 05:54.677
This is a remarkable serum, and, as
a responsible senior officer of the Space Corps,

05:54.850 --> 05:58.411
it's imperative I gain possession of it
and use some myself.

05:58.587 --> 06:01.021
Oh, my God, you are sexy!

06:01.189 --> 06:04.249
So very, very sexy!

06:08.297 --> 06:12.495
Yesterday, he was observed
injecting his groin with anaesthetic -

06:12.668 --> 06:15.228
an attempt to regain some self control.

06:27.949 --> 06:29.940
- Hi.
- (ALL) Hi.

06:31.520 --> 06:37.516
I also suspect someone, possibly Lister, gave
Rimmer access to the crew's confidential files.

06:37.693 --> 06:42.187
He's using this information
to blackmail his way up the chain of command.

06:42.364 --> 06:45.822
It's unforgivable, but it's a technique
that can work.

06:46.001 --> 06:49.994
I should know. I used the same method myself
to become captain.

06:50.172 --> 06:55.633
If the crew discover I'm really
just Dennis the doughnut boy, I'm finished.

06:56.411 --> 06:59.471
I will continue to observe Lister's actions in AR,

06:59.648 --> 07:02.617
and expect my suspicions to be confirmed.
Report ends.

- Major Tom!
- Yeah, Major Tom!

07:30.412 --> 07:34.075
Major Tom, what is your clearance code
and pilot number?

07:34.249 --> 07:38.083
I'm sorry. I left all my details
in my other pants.

07:38.253 --> 07:40.118
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

07:40.288 --> 07:44.816
- Wow!
- Without take-off clearance,

07:44.993 --> 07:49.157
- I can't permit you to fly.
- I can handle this thing OK. I'm good.

07:49.331 --> 07:52.232
I'm better than good - I'm smooth.

07:52.401 --> 07:55.029
I feel smooth.

07:56.138 --> 07:59.539
That's as maybe, but I need proof
that you can fly that thing.

There was a drug on the gluey bit we licked.

with him, I'll cut off both his...

- If we're plugged into AR software,

to allow escape.

something like a trapdoor or exit.

- Suggest we persuade you to come with us

- Only poor people say that.
- Forget it. He's not gonna change his mind.

The crew will know we're out of AR now
and will send someone to investigate.

So, what's it to be?

18:01.209 --> 18:06.909

18:25.533 --> 18:29.128
and find my pubes are orange
and I'm handcuffed to a goat.

18:30.271 --> 18:36.005
And most hilarious of all, discovering I'm
superglued to the rear of one of those rabbits

18:36.177 --> 18:38.577

18:38.746 --> 18:43.149
Ah! Those mad japes they play on you.
I can't miss all that.

18:43.317 --> 18:47.583
That's not gonna happen,
just like it didn't happen for the other Rimmer.

18:47.755 --> 18:50.349
<i>We're giving you a second chance at life,</i>

18:50.525 --> 18:55.428
<i>and an opportunity for you to screw it up</i>
<i>in a new and original way.</i>

18:57.365 --> 19:02.826
You'll get a seat in the cockpit
and you'll be in control of at least five buttons.

19:03.004 --> 19:07.668
He's hardly going to be impressed
at being in charge of a few buttons!

19:07.842 --> 19:10.504
Five, you say?

19:10.678 --> 19:15.775
No more vending machine maintenance.
No more getting heckled by drinks dispensers.

19:15.950 --> 19:18.043
That's five whole buttons?

19:18.219 --> 19:20.380
A new start, a new life.

19:20.555 --> 19:23.149
Each morning, you'll wanna leap out of bed.

19:23.324 --> 19:28.819
In your case, Mr. Lister, that's because your
sheets are covered in pointy poppadom shards.

19:28.996 --> 19:32.090
Tell me about these buttons.
Are some illuminated?

19:32.266 --> 19:36.430
What do you say, man? The old Rimmer
was a vital member of the team.

19:36.604 --> 19:40.096
He performed essential functions
we've never replaced.

19:40.274 --> 19:41.639
What did he do?

19:41.809 --> 19:43.800
Dunno, really.

19:43.978 --> 19:46.344
He, um... He was, um...

19:48.883 --> 19:50.851
Head of Safety.

19:51.018 --> 19:55.648
Head of Safety? That's a hell of a title.
What did he actually do?

19:56.724 --> 20:02.321
You sort out danger. You sort out peril. Then
you advise on the best way to run away from it.

20:03.931 --> 20:06.923
Head of Safety, five buttons.

20:07.368 --> 20:08.665
I'm in!

20:09.637 --> 20:11.798
He's in? Let's celebrate!

20:11.973 --> 20:14.271
I'll crack open a bottle of cyanide.

20:28.956 --> 20:34.986
This is ground control.
You don't appear to have flight clearance.

20:35.796 --> 20:41.098
- You're the ground controller?
- Please state your name and clearance code.

20:41.269 --> 20:42.964
Reality sucks!

20:43.938 --> 20:46.930
Your name's Reality Sucks? (LAUGHS)

20:47.108 --> 20:49.235
One second, Mr. Sucks.

20:50.645 --> 20:52.909
Just checking my clearance list.

20:54.348 --> 20:57.943
- Just do another smegging dance and we'll go.
- Dance?!

20:58.119 --> 21:00.417
With her, I'd have trouble walking!

21:00.588 --> 21:02.715
I'm powering up.

21:06.561 --> 21:09.962
Come back, Mr. Sucks! Come back!

21:18.773 --> 21:23.801
There's nothing on the scanners for
a 1,000-mile radius. We're in the clear, guys!

21:23.978 --> 21:25.502
(ALL) Yes!

21:26.414 --> 21:28.507
- I don't believe we are.
- What's up?

21:28.683 --> 21:33.177
According to the supplies inventory,
we're frighteningly low on...

21:33.354 --> 21:37.290
- I can barely say it.
- What are we frighteningly low on? Oxygen?

21:37.458 --> 21:39.824
Worse. Fabric softener!

21:40.628 --> 21:44.894
Suggest we chart a course
to the nearest derelict - the SS Einstein -

21:45.066 --> 21:48.001
before your woollens get all bibbly-bobbly.

21:49.337 --> 21:53.296
Einstein? Wasn't he the dude
who discovered America?

21:53.474 --> 21:57.137
- Einstein discovered the theory of relativity.
- Where?

21:57.311 --> 21:59.836
Was it fossilized and stuff?

22:01.015 --> 22:03.347
The theory of relativity is...

22:06.153 --> 22:09.452
- What is the theory of relativity?
- What is it, Hol?

22:10.491 --> 22:12.459
<i>Bit busy at the moment, Dave.</i>

22:12.627 --> 22:15.721
Just tell us what it is in simple layman's terms.

22:15.896 --> 22:17.887
<i>It's a theory.</i>

22:18.833 --> 22:20.164
Yeah, but what is it?

22:20.334 --> 22:23.167
<i>You want it more complicated</i>
<i>than that, do you?</i>

22:23.337 --> 22:26.864
- What does it mean?
- <i>It's the theory of relativity.</i>

22:27.041 --> 22:30.841
<i>You know</i> - <i>it's a theory</i>
<i>you only tell your relatives.</i>

22:32.513 --> 22:36.540
It's so sad. Holly's supposed
to have an IQ of 6,000.

22:36.717 --> 22:38.981
Now, I doubt he could even spell IQ.

22:39.153 --> 22:43.590
<i>If I'm so stupid, if I'm computer-senile,</i>
<i>explain this then.</i>

22:44.592 --> 22:45.923
Explain what?

22:46.093 --> 22:48.186
<i>You can't, can you? I</i>

22:52.133 --> 22:53.430
Explain what?

22:53.601 --> 22:57.162
<i>It's no good stalling, trying to buy time.</i>

22:57.838 --> 22:59.135
<i>If I'm so stupid,</i>

22:59.307 --> 23:04.267
<i>how was I able to recreate a new set</i>
<i>of nanobots and get them to resurrect the crew?</i>

23:04.445 --> 23:05.844
(ALL) What?

23:06.013 --> 23:08.072
<i>I thought you'd be pleased.</i>

23:08.249 --> 23:09.648
But why?

23:09.817 --> 23:11.785
<i>My job is to keep Dave sane.</i>

23:11.952 --> 23:15.149
<i>True, I'm not that good at it, but I do my best.</i>

23:15.323 --> 23:19.157
<i>That's why I create little diversions</i>
<i>to keep him occupied.</i>

23:19.327 --> 23:22.922
Hol, we could have wound up
doing two years in the brig!

23:23.097 --> 23:26.066
<i>You still could. I've just worked it out.</i>

23:26.233 --> 23:27.700
<i>We're still in AR.</i>

23:27.868 --> 23:29.631
(ALL) What?

23:29.804 --> 23:31.101
<i>In computer jargon,</i>

23:31.272 --> 23:33.763
<i>my plans have all gone tits up.</i>

23:38.879 --> 23:42.144
- <i>I was out-thought and out manoeuvred.</i>
- <i>Who by?</i>

23:42.316 --> 23:44.648
<i>By a superior intellect.</i>

23:44.819 --> 23:49.051
You mean the hand dryer in the toilets
has outsmarted you again?

23:49.690 --> 23:55.151
<i>No. By that other version of me</i> -
<i>the one on Red Dwarf. This is still our trial.</i>

23:55.329 --> 23:57.422
Our trial? Why didn't you say?

23:57.598 --> 23:59.964
If I'd known, I'd have worn a tie!

24:02.837 --> 24:06.898
The nanobots story is corroborated.
They tried to track 'em down.

24:07.074 --> 24:11.374
Their actions in the psychotropically
induced scenario bear that out.

24:11.545 --> 24:13.137
<i>I agree, Frank.</i>

24:13.314 --> 24:18.911
<i>I also believe we died and were indeed</i>
<i>resurrected</i> - <i>again, borne out by their actions.</i>

24:19.086 --> 24:22.419
So, original charges - all innocent.

24:22.590 --> 24:28.324
But it's apparent that they used classified
information from the crew's confidential files

24:28.496 --> 24:29.793
to their own ends.

24:29.964 --> 24:36.301
I suspected Rimmer had access when he began
acting incredibly smart and knowledgeable.

24:36.470 --> 24:38.563
<i>What a giveaway!</i>

24:39.373 --> 24:43.901
That's why I got him to lick a psychotropic
envelope when I asked him to dinner.

24:44.078 --> 24:48.981
<i>So, abusing classified information.</i>
<i>That's a fresh charge.</i>

24:49.150 --> 24:51.050
On that, they're all guilty.

24:51.218 --> 24:53.743
- <i>That's a statutory sentence.</i>
- I know.

24:53.921 --> 24:56.481
Two years in the brig.

24:56.657 --> 25:01.594
<i>So instead of the original charge and a possible</i>
<i>sentence of two years in the brig,</i>

25:01.762 --> 25:03.957
<i>they've been found guilty on another charge</i>

25:04.131 --> 25:07.362
<i>and got an entirely different</i>
<i>two years in the brig.</i>

25:08.536 --> 25:11.027
<i>That's gonna be a great comfort to them.</i>

25:11.205 --> 25:13.696
<i>I'll bring them round and break the news.</i>

25:17.178 --> 25:20.739
- This is reality? But how can we be sure?
- Why do we care?

25:20.915 --> 25:23.907
Nothing makes any sense
no matter where we are.

25:24.084 --> 25:28.316
Look, everything was real
before we licked the envelopes, right?

25:28.489 --> 25:31.390
Then we conked out and got carted off to AR.

25:31.559 --> 25:33.550
Before we licked anything...

25:33.727 --> 25:36.958
Before we licked anything,
I lent you my Holly watch.

25:37.598 --> 25:40.761
So if this is reality, I should still be wearing it.

25:40.935 --> 25:45.770
<i>Oh, yeah. This is reality, all right.</i>
<i>I'd recognise it anywhere.</i>

25:46.240 --> 25:51.200
Also, shouldn't you have the viruses? You found
them on Starbug before we licked the envelopes.

25:54.348 --> 25:55.838
The luck virus.

25:56.016 --> 25:58.075
Maybe we can get out of this mess.

25:58.252 --> 26:01.949
I'll have that. The lab boys
are gonna want to run tests on it.

26:02.122 --> 26:04.420
(CAPTAIN) Where's the other one?

26:04.592 --> 26:06.753
I'm afraid I lost it, sir.

26:06.927 --> 26:10.761
Goddammit, Rimmer! I wanted that...

26:10.931 --> 26:15.459
I mean, the lab boys wanted it
to test it too. Damn!

26:16.537 --> 26:18.630
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

26:18.806 --> 26:21.707
You betrayed us over the confidential file scam.

26:21.876 --> 26:24.936
- Stole the sexual magnetism virus.
- Lied to us.

26:25.112 --> 26:29.674
And behaved like a self-serving,
scum-sucking, ruthless little rat bag!

26:29.850 --> 26:31.750
And that's bad?

26:31.919 --> 26:38.347
<i>(CAPTAIN) You have been found guilty</i>
<i>of contravening Act 21 of the Space Federation.</i>

26:38.526 --> 26:44.158
<i>Before sentencing, you will have medicals so</i>
<i>you can be assigned appropriate prison status.</i>

26:45.566 --> 26:47.932
<i>I've buggered this up a bit, haven't I?</i>

27:09.557 --> 27:11.923
Welcome to the Tank.

27:34.748 --> 27:38.343
<i>(SONG) It's cold outside,</i>
<i>there's no kind of atmosphere</i>

27:38.519 --> 27:41.784
<i>I'm all alone, more or less</i>

27:41.956 --> 27:45.016
<i>Let me fly far away from here</i>

27:45.192 --> 27:48.025
<i>Fun, fun, fun</i>

27:48.195 --> 27:51.687
<i>In the sun, sun, sun</i>

27:51.865 --> 27:55.232
<i>I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose</i>

27:55.402 --> 27:58.428
<i>Drinking fresh mango juice</i>

27:58.606 --> 28:01.837
<i>Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes</i>

28:02.009 --> 28:04.773
<i>Fun, fun, fun</i>

28:04.945 --> 28:08.346
<i>In the sun, sun, sun</i>

28:08.515 --> 28:11.382
<i>Fun, fun, fun</i>

28:11.552 --> 28:15.545
<i>In the sun, sun, sun</i>
