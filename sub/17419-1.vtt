00:23.356 --> 00:25.024
Oh. Oh, yeah. Yep.
Take that.

00:25.026 --> 00:27.026
Okay, if you want
to visit Newton,

00:27.028 --> 00:29.695
I know he'd be
happy to see you.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.230
Yeah, okay.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.032
We never finished
<i>Carnivàle,</i>

00:33.034 --> 00:35.868
so if you want to finish
the last two episodes...

00:35.870 --> 00:37.136
I don't. No.
You don't. Okay.

00:37.138 --> 00:40.873
I don't.
So, we can be buddies.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.141
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.109
In time.
In time, yeah.

00:49.315 --> 00:51.316
Uh, all right.
All right.

No.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.324
Yes.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.126
Does that thing actually work?

02:07.128 --> 02:09.127
Sex partner found.
Oh, my God.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.562
Hey, where's Wolcott
and Cermak?

02:10.564 --> 02:12.131
It's, like, eight blocks away.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.333
(sighs) I can usually
get it within five.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.801
Your place is remote, man.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.069
Uh, I'm sorry?

02:17.071 --> 02:19.171
You got to get
on this thing, bro.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.473
I mean, it's just
weird to think

02:21.475 --> 02:24.176
about being with anybody else--
we were together for six years.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.644
I thought four.
I count
the two years

02:25.646 --> 02:28.247
we kind of e-mailed each other
before we kissed.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.648
There you go.
No, n-n-n-no.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.150
He's on a very
specific diet.

02:31.152 --> 02:33.652
There's tons of vitamins
in pizza, man.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.487
He eats bugs and little fruit.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.655
You should go to Torch tonight.

02:36.657 --> 02:37.856
What?

02:37.858 --> 02:38.991
Here, wear this.
What is this?

02:38.993 --> 02:40.259
Robert Graham,
contrasting cuffs.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.994
You will crush gash.

02:41.996 --> 02:42.995
What an awful...

02:42.997 --> 02:45.030
Every gash is
somebody's daughter.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.165
Here, wear this.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.866
That's not bad.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.002
It's easy-- just go up
to them and be, like,

02:50.004 --> 02:52.337
"Hey, what's
your deal?"
Wh-What does
that even mean?

02:52.339 --> 02:54.173
Doesn't matter, dude.
You read <i> The Game?</i>

02:54.175 --> 02:56.175
You got to give them
little trinkets,

02:56.177 --> 02:57.676
you got to pinch them--
it works.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.011
You got to wear
a Jamiroquai hat.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.513
Well, to be
honest, I, uh...

03:01.515 --> 03:04.449
I actually have my own
plans this evening.

03:04.451 --> 03:07.186
Yeah. Yeah, my sister's setting
me up with her friend

03:07.188 --> 03:08.687
from Sweden.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.189
Holy shit!

03:10.191 --> 03:11.456
Yeah, I'm pretty
psyched about it.

03:11.458 --> 03:14.459
Liz says she's, uh,
confident, funny.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.028
Congrats, what's
she look like?

03:16.030 --> 03:17.729
I-I-I don't know.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.299
You didn't ask to
see a picture?

03:20.301 --> 03:22.234
I talked you up,
okay?

03:22.236 --> 03:24.369
She's so well-read.
Oh, good.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.138
This is, like,
a woman of substance.

03:26.140 --> 03:28.140
Oh, good. That's-that's
what's most important.

03:28.142 --> 03:29.408
You know, all Mike
wanted to know was,

03:29.410 --> 03:30.542
(low voice): "What
does she look like?"

03:30.544 --> 03:32.077
That guy is
disgusting.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.879
He's so gross.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.414
But this girl tonight,
what does she look like?

03:35.416 --> 03:36.748
Oh, there she is.
What? Oh, no.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.050
Wait, where?
She's right outside.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.484
See? She's in
the Dumpster.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.220
(snorting)

03:41.222 --> 03:43.155
She's that thing across
the street in the garbage?

03:43.157 --> 03:45.490
She's right there, see?
In the Dumpster.

03:45.492 --> 03:46.792
Oh, my God.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.064
Something wrong?
You said she
was from Sweden?

03:52.066 --> 03:54.166
She was born
in the Scandinavian forest.

03:54.168 --> 03:55.434
Right.
She moved here
last year

03:55.436 --> 03:57.436
so she could run
her nonprofit.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.338
And live underneath
the Wabash Bridge.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.106
Does that mean
she's a troll?

04:01.108 --> 04:02.574
I'm sorry,
is that a problem?

04:02.576 --> 04:04.509
No, no, no.
Just, um, uh...

04:04.511 --> 04:06.078
She's drinking
antifreeze.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.346
Uh, okay, cool.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.747
No, I just...
I'm saying...

04:08.749 --> 04:11.083
Um... she might
not be my type.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.085
Joshua, want to have a little
look-at-yourself moment?

04:13.087 --> 04:14.186
No. No, this is...

04:14.188 --> 04:15.420
Do you go to the gym?
Nope.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.189
Do you have a job?

04:17.190 --> 04:18.857
Yeah, I-I...
I'm a temp.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.358
Okay, well, how does
that sound to a lady?

04:20.361 --> 04:22.194
If she's a temp,
she'll like it.

04:22.196 --> 04:24.096
She keeps barking
at strangers...
Josh,

04:24.098 --> 04:26.765
this woman has brought
herself up from nothing.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.867
Why are you crying?
I just really
like her, okay?

04:28.869 --> 04:30.269
I think you guys would
be cool together.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.436
I appreciate
this so much.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.604
This is a mitzvah
you've done.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.939
I just, uh...

04:33.941 --> 04:36.208
Josh, there's,
like, so many guys

04:36.210 --> 04:37.209
like Mike
running around.

04:37.211 --> 04:38.210
You're such
a good guy.

04:38.212 --> 04:40.145
I love you.
I love you.

04:40.147 --> 04:41.780
I wouldn't have set you up
with Gorbachaka

04:41.782 --> 04:43.448
if I didn't think
it was a good match.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.983
Okay?
Thank you so much.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.219
I noticed you were,
uh, rummaging around

04:47.221 --> 04:49.288
in the, uh,
garbage, there.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.157
I-I-In my temp job,

04:52.159 --> 04:53.992
I actually have to deal
with garbage quite frequently.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.962
End of the day, I go around
to everybody's desk

04:56.964 --> 04:58.830
and take all the little
bags of garbage

04:58.832 --> 05:01.967
and put them in one
big bag of garbage.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.969
Pretty cool.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.137
(sniffs)

05:05.139 --> 05:06.471
Can't wait
for that bruschetta.

05:07.407 --> 05:08.974
Flower for the lady?

05:08.976 --> 05:10.575
Yeah, why not?

05:10.577 --> 05:11.810
Twelve dollars.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.911
Twelve dollars?!

05:16.316 --> 05:17.916
Here you are.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.217
Here's a flower
for you.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.722
Mmm.

05:24.924 --> 05:26.325
(spits)

05:26.327 --> 05:27.926
(grunts lightly)

05:27.928 --> 05:30.228
I know,
I know-- roses.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.099
You ever seen,
uh,<i> Carnivàle?</i>

05:34.101 --> 05:35.867
Huh?

05:35.869 --> 05:38.003
This is, uh,
it's kind of nice.

05:38.005 --> 05:41.273
Sort of sitting here,
getting to know each other.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.275
My friend Mike...

05:43.277 --> 05:45.177
he's just obsessed
with these, uh...

05:45.179 --> 05:47.012
these dating apps.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.182
This guy spends just hours
trolling the Internet...

05:50.184 --> 05:51.116
(squeals)

05:51.118 --> 05:52.517
Oh, my God.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.685
Oh, my God,
no, no, no.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.686
I didn't mean it
like that.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.188
I'm sorry.
Ow, ow!

05:56.190 --> 05:58.890
Ow! Ow-ow-ow-ow...
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

05:58.892 --> 05:59.958
Ow!

06:03.062 --> 06:04.029
(screams)

06:04.031 --> 06:05.597
(growls)

06:10.303 --> 06:13.038
No. No. No. No.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.641
Mom, they're so adorable.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.443
He's wearing the sweater.

06:19.979 --> 06:22.214
No.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.616
Please.
Oh, for God's sakes.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.153
Is everything okay?

06:28.155 --> 06:30.155
No, it's not.

06:30.157 --> 06:33.058
Josh, you're not making
a great impression here.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.227
Well, I don't care-- this
is clearly not gonna work.

06:35.229 --> 06:38.397
Why not?
Because she's an
ugly slimy troll!

06:38.399 --> 06:39.998
(gasping)

06:41.334 --> 06:42.401
Oh.

06:42.403 --> 06:45.504
Uh... I... uh, sorry.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.073
I just got out
of a long-term relationship.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.075
I-I don't know what I'm doing.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.010
I... I'm sorry, Liz.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.080
I'm not the one that
you should apologize to.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.249
Yeah, fair enough.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.286
I'm sorry, Gorbachaka.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.655
(snarls)

07:06.759 --> 07:08.827
(sighs)

07:12.698 --> 07:14.666
Oh, my God.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.769
Ugh.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.038
(sighs)

07:26.712 --> 07:28.780
MIKE:

08:02.148 --> 08:04.182
Hey, how are you?

08:04.184 --> 08:06.218
Yeah, I'm just at this club,
it's really nice.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.855
Hey.
(sniffs)

08:09.857 --> 08:11.189
Uh, what's your deal?

08:11.191 --> 08:13.024
Sorry. Excuse me?

08:13.026 --> 08:15.026
Uh.. what... uh...

08:15.028 --> 08:16.428
Uh, wh-what's your deal?

08:16.430 --> 08:17.996
One second, there's
this weird guy.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.331
He just asked me
what's my deal.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.333
You're making people
uncomfortable.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.034
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.670
I'm not the one you
should apologize to.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.506
He's wearing a Robert Graham
shirt, I mean...

08:27.508 --> 08:29.241
I'm sorry, ma'am.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.179
Right this way,
sweetheart.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.580

08:54.367 --> 08:55.867
What... oh, man.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.736
MAN: Joshie.
WOMAN: Hi, Joshie.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.804
JOSH: Hi, Mom. Hi there, Tom.
Ooh, look at
that nice shirt.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.373
TOM: Oh, that-that's fantastic.
MOM: That's smart.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.707
That's nice, I like that.

09:02.709 --> 09:03.875
Thank you, thank you. I...

09:03.877 --> 09:05.577
When are you
coming to visit?

09:05.579 --> 09:07.212
T-Tickets are very expensive
this time of year.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.980
Well, put it on
the Discover Card.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.650
I told you, Mom, I'm not-not
using the Discover anymore.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.751
Why not?

09:12.753 --> 09:14.252
It's pretty pathetic.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.421
I'm 27, I should probably have
my own credit card by now.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.156
Ugh, here we go.
You're 27?

09:19.725 --> 09:21.326
It's not your fault
you're broke.
It's not.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.894
You...
Everyone is struggling
in this economy.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.996
Everyb... But your
sister's a special case.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.232
TOM:
Promotion after promotion.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.667
It's insane.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.735
How'd it go
with Gorbachaka?
Ooh.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.571
What? How do...
You know about that?

09:32.573 --> 09:35.006
You know, your mother
and I met on a blind date.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.575
But with different
people.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.843
Oh, yeah. No, I know--
it's-it's a terrific story.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.078
MOM:
Our tables were right next

09:40.080 --> 09:41.413
to each other.
Right.

09:41.415 --> 09:42.681
And when our

09:42.683 --> 09:44.449

10:02.436 --> 10:03.635
So great to hear from you.

10:03.637 --> 10:04.636
Really?!
(stammers)

10:04.638 --> 10:06.705
I mean, yeah, no, me, same.

10:06.707 --> 10:07.706
Me, same.

10:07.708 --> 10:08.773
You should come to my apartment.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.709
What... uh, now?

10:10.711 --> 10:12.811
Yeah, I'm throwing a huge party.

10:12.813 --> 10:13.778
You should stop by.

10:13.780 --> 10:14.980
I mean, if you're out.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.848
Oh... I'm out.

10:25.224 --> 10:26.791
Forty dollars.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.460
Do you take
Discover Card?

10:28.462 --> 10:31.296
Uh, I think Maggie's code
is four something.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.498
JOSH:
Pound, four-three-four-two.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.668
Pound, four-three-four-two.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.670
MIKE: Josh, this is Aja.
Aja, Josh.

10:38.672 --> 10:39.671
JOSH:
Oh, mazel tov.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.239
Hey, how'd
your date go, buddy?

10:41.241 --> 10:42.907
Oh, let's just get up
to the party.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.242
Is that champagne?

10:44.244 --> 10:45.744
It's, uh, Prosecco,
Maggie's favorite.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.312
Ah, you know, I think
it's pretty cool

10:47.314 --> 10:48.647
of you to
come tonight.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.148
It's gonna mean
a lot to them.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.750
Uh, th-them?

10:51.752 --> 10:53.251
Dude, you know she's
seeing someone, right?

10:54.420 --> 10:55.654
No, I didn't know that.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.422
How long has this been going on?

10:57.424 --> 10:58.990
Uh, at least a month.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.326
I'm sorry, I
thought you knew.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.427
Who is he?

11:02.429 --> 11:03.828
This guy, Adolf.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.096
His name is Adolf?
Yeah.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.665
L-Like Adolf Hitler?

11:06.667 --> 11:07.832
Oh, cool, you know him.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.168
I-I know <i> of</i> him.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.503
I thought he died,
like, years ago.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.371
Nah, he faked that. Yeah.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.873
He's been hiding in Argentina

11:14.875 --> 11:16.675
since, like, the '40s.

11:16.677 --> 11:17.942
I know he's got a weird rep,

11:17.944 --> 11:19.678
and people think he's sketchy
or whatever,

11:19.680 --> 11:21.680
but in person,
he's actually pretty cool.

11:21.682 --> 11:24.015
Like, this one time
we did karaoke.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.617
(laughs)
What?

11:25.619 --> 11:27.052
He was hilarious.
He did Tina Turner,

11:27.054 --> 11:29.020
Gladys Knight.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.289
(distorted): He did
a monologue from <i> Precious,</i>

11:31.291 --> 11:34.025
which wasn't even
in the karaoke book.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.360
Blew all our minds.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.029
He just had it memorized.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.297
(normal voice):
You okay, buddy?

11:39.299 --> 11:40.865
I-Isn't there, like,

11:40.867 --> 11:42.867
a pretty big age-age difference
between them?

11:42.869 --> 11:43.868
I mean, Maggie's only 27.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.870
Somebody's jealous.
Yeah.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.238
I'm not jealous, Aja.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.741
I-I just don't like
Adolf Hitler.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.710
He-he murdered millions
of people.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.079
You don't like him
because he's dating Maggie.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.980
True, but you don't think
it's a little strange

11:55.982 --> 11:58.717
that she's dating him,
of all people?

11:58.719 --> 12:00.552
I'm Jewish.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.320
He famously hates Jews.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.889
Oh, that is a
real stretch, Josh.
Don't make this about you.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.559
I think I'm just gonna go home.
MAGGIE:
Josh!

12:07.561 --> 12:08.593
(chuckles)

12:08.595 --> 12:09.728
Hey.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.496
(muttering)
Oh, my God.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.497
Yeah.
How are you?

12:12.499 --> 12:13.898
Good, how... I'm good.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.767
Hug, come on.
Yeah, hugs, come on.

12:15.769 --> 12:18.069
Oh, is that, is that Prosecco?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.604
Oh, yes, it is.
Would you like some?

12:19.606 --> 12:21.272
Um, that's okay, actually,

12:21.274 --> 12:23.274
'cause Adolf just opened
some Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.776
Oh, shit.
Yeah.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.845
Oh, hello.
Oh.

12:26.847 --> 12:27.846
Hey.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.181
This is prewar.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.250
There-there is plenty
for everyone.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.351
Delicious.

12:33.353 --> 12:34.753
Yeah. Hey!

12:34.755 --> 12:36.755
Hey, A.H.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.423
That's the man.
That's you.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.791
That's the man.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.426
(laughs)
What's up?

12:41.428 --> 12:42.594
Hi.
Hey.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.763
Adolf Hitler.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.364
Uh, Josh Greenberg.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.599
Greenberg?
Yes.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.967
Uh-oh!

12:48.969 --> 12:50.769
(laughter)

12:50.771 --> 12:52.370
Uh-oh!

12:52.372 --> 12:53.605
Uh-oh.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.206
Uh-oh!

12:57.276 --> 12:58.943
There's a Jew at Hitler's party.

12:58.945 --> 12:59.978
That's right. That's right.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.380
There's one in our midst.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.382
Um, you can just throw that down

13:04.384 --> 13:05.483
over there.
Oh, good, yeah.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.118
I've heard so much about you.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.153
Oh, yeah, good.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.387
So much about you.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.990
I'm fairly well-versed in you.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.958
Wikipedia.
Yeah.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.727
There is a compact disc player.

13:15.729 --> 13:16.728
Oh, good news.

13:16.730 --> 13:18.730
We have, um, R&B,

13:18.732 --> 13:20.832
young-young-young music.

13:20.834 --> 13:23.301
Yes, yeah, yeah.
Oh, no Wagner?

13:23.303 --> 13:24.803
No, there's Wagner.

13:24.805 --> 13:25.737
Oh, good.
Yeah.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.307
Mwah.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.476
Little dirty man.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.811
Don't make it awkward
for the Jew.
No, I'm sure...

13:32.813 --> 13:34.813
Nice-nice to meet you.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.655
(laughter)

13:45.424 --> 13:47.926
MIKE:
Tinder is like Facebook,

13:47.928 --> 13:50.595
but it's just, like,
straight to smashing.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.330
To smashing?
Yeah.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.365
ADOLF:
When I was in Austria,

13:54.367 --> 13:56.000
back in that era,
I would say "That one,"

13:56.002 --> 13:57.502
and my bodyguards,

13:57.504 --> 13:59.671
they would take her and they
would put her in my bed.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.105
Really?
They would burn the house down.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.507
MIKE:
That is cool.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.608
That was my Tinder.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.943
Oh, yeah.
That's the good old days.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.377
That's the good old days.
No apps for that.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.513
Yeah. (chuckles)

14:08.515 --> 14:09.681
I wish I was there with you.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.049
You'd be dead if you were there.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.784
Oh, I know.
You don't want to be dead.

14:17.456 --> 14:18.556
Would you like some wine?

14:18.558 --> 14:20.558
Um, I think I'll
switch to beer.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.026
Oh, what kind of beer
would you like?

14:22.028 --> 14:23.228
Anything German.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.196
ALL:
Aw.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.231
ADOLF:
Be right back.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.565
Okay.
Okay, all right.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.867
There you go.

14:30.069 --> 14:31.402
There you are.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.570
Hey.
Hey.

14:32.572 --> 14:33.571
We still haven't caught up.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.540
How's everything?

14:35.542 --> 14:37.809
I miss you.

14:37.811 --> 14:38.910
(laughs)

14:38.912 --> 14:40.879
Oh, Josh, you're drunk.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.547
I'm not drunk. No, I-I, uh...

14:42.549 --> 14:45.383
Why, uh...

14:45.385 --> 14:47.652
Why-why are you with this guy?

14:47.654 --> 14:50.722
I mean, I-I know he's, um,
more successful than me.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.557
My relationship with Dolfy
has nothing to do with you.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.059
Okay? We're-we're just
two people who fell in love.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.728
He's 150 years old.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.229
He's 126.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.598
I can't believe
I'm defending myself to you.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.834
I still have Isaac Newton.

15:02.836 --> 15:04.569
Isaac Newton.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.604
This-this little reptile.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.006
Remember, we said,

15:08.008 --> 15:10.408
we were gonna nurse him
back to health together.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.843
We were on mushrooms.

15:11.845 --> 15:13.578
You should free that thing.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.413
I love you.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.514
(laughing):
Josh.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.082
Don't you still love me?

15:18.084 --> 15:20.118
Josh.
I'm better than Hitler!

15:20.120 --> 15:22.754
(crowd gasps)

15:24.089 --> 15:26.024
Hey, uh...

15:26.026 --> 15:27.625
I think maybe you
should head out, buddy.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.527
Let things cool down a bit.

15:29.529 --> 15:30.528
Yeah.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.530
Fair enough.
Uh, I'm sorry, Maggie.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.001
I'm not the one
you should apologize to.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.104
I'm sorry, Hitler.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.474
He couldn't hear you.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.476
I'm sorry, Hitler!

15:45.478 --> 15:46.945
What?

15:46.947 --> 15:48.713
I'm sorry, Hit...

15:50.482 --> 15:52.483
Oh, hey, do you think you guys

15:52.485 --> 15:54.552
could drop me off in Pilsen?

15:56.488 --> 15:58.623
Isn't your place north, babe?

15:58.625 --> 16:01.693
Uh, sorry, man, we're going
in opposite directions.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.700
(thunder rumbling)

16:11.136 --> 16:12.870
(bird screeches)

16:21.647 --> 16:23.715
(card reader chirping)

16:43.602 --> 16:47.605
(blows raspberry)

17:03.689 --> 17:05.690
(mouthing)

17:05.692 --> 17:07.959
It's a good thing
it's the weekend.

17:07.961 --> 17:09.694
What?

17:09.695 --> 17:10.862
Uh, it-it's the weekend.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.195
Good thing.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.132
What?

17:14.134 --> 17:15.967
A good thing it's the weekend.

17:15.969 --> 17:17.135
Oh. (chuckles)

17:17.703 --> 17:19.537
Yeah.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.704
TGIF.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.205
Yeah, exactly.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.541
Or I guess it's more like

17:24.544 --> 17:25.542
TGIS.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.711
Um, because it's Saturday.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.880
So...
Right, TGIS.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.081
Yes, yes.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.716
Saturday.
Saturday, yeah.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.152
Oh, um,

17:34.154 --> 17:36.587
are you coming?

17:36.589 --> 17:37.889
Uh, this is
going south, right?

17:37.891 --> 17:39.957
Oh, no, it's going north.

17:43.328 --> 17:44.796
That-That's the direction
I'm going in.

17:50.502 --> 17:52.937
Uh, what-what class
did you say you were in again?

17:52.939 --> 17:54.172
Oh, '07.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.406
'07.
Yeah.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.607
Um, '07, '07.

17:56.609 --> 17:57.909
Uh, do you know,

17:57.911 --> 17:59.677
uh, Ted Kasden?

17:59.679 --> 18:01.612
No.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.081
He might have been '08,
actually.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.917
What about Jake, uh,
Jake Barnes?

18:05.919 --> 18:07.418
I knew a Jake Franklin.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.754
No, I don't know that guy.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.956
There's a lot of Jakes.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.125
Well-well, Chris Schifrin.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.426
Chris Schifrin?

18:15.428 --> 18:16.928
Oh, Chris Schifrin.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.529
Yeah, I think I had
an anthro class with him.

18:18.531 --> 18:19.530
Oh.
Are-are you friends with him?

18:19.532 --> 18:20.832
Not at all.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.268
Uh, I know his brother.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.104
I'm an acquaintance
of one of his brothers.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.805
Oh.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.207
Um...

18:29.209 --> 18:31.809
Wow.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.211
It's a...

18:33.213 --> 18:34.712
small world.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.115
Yeah, hugely small.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.282
(bell dings)

18:38.284 --> 18:39.550
Oh.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.785
This is my stop.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.620
Oh, okay.
So, um, well,

18:42.622 --> 18:44.122
it was really nice meeting you.
Yeah.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.790
Josh.
Oh, Laura.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.558
Hi.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.495
Hey, do you want to go
out to dinner sometime?

18:50.497 --> 18:53.631
What?
Would you like to go
out to dinner sometime?

18:53.633 --> 18:56.300
Oh, sure.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.736
Uh, how, uh...

18:58.738 --> 19:01.139
Oh, um, I have a business card.
Sorry.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.807
It's old-fashioned.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.143
Well, I'll, uh, I look forward
to doing business.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.145
Oh. (laughs)

19:07.147 --> 19:08.479
Okay.
Okay.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.081
Okay.
Um...

19:10.083 --> 19:11.649
(bell dings)
Here I go.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.251
Okay.
Okay.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.919
(bell dings)
Okay.

19:17.256 --> 19:19.390
(sniffs)

19:21.593 --> 19:23.661
(phone buzzing)

19:25.664 --> 19:27.431
Hello.

19:27.433 --> 19:28.833
MAN:
Good morning, Joshua.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.668
I'm calling
from the MacArthur Foundation.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.837
I'm pleased to announce
that you shall be receiving

19:32.839 --> 19:34.172
one of our annual rewards.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.707
Wait, you mean the genius grant?

19:36.709 --> 19:37.775
Uh, for what?

19:37.777 --> 19:39.210
For picking up Laura.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.712
Oh, right.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.614
The MacArthur board members
were all wondering,

19:43.616 --> 19:45.283
how'd you manage it?

19:45.285 --> 19:47.218
Did you use a line or something?

19:47.220 --> 19:49.287
No, no, I just, uh, saw her

19:49.289 --> 19:51.522
and struck up a conversation.

19:51.524 --> 19:54.392
Well, what did you say to her?
How did you start it?

19:54.394 --> 19:57.562
Uh, I-I said something about,
uh, how it's the weekend

19:57.564 --> 20:00.531
and how it was cool
that it was the weekend.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.634
Uh, then I found out
she found went to Bard,

20:03.636 --> 20:05.036
and I knew some people
that went there,

20:05.038 --> 20:06.704
so then we started talking
about that.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.706
Knew people at Bard.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.708
Talked about people
who went to Bard.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.977
Really can't believe
you actually did it.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.046
Neither can I. I've, like,
never done that before.

20:15.048 --> 20:18.049
Just walked up to a random girl
and been like,

20:18.051 --> 20:19.984
"Hey, let's go out."

20:19.986 --> 20:23.054
I did it once, back when
I was reading law at Cambridge.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.089
Saw this young woman
I recognized from section,

20:25.091 --> 20:26.557
and I asked her
to have lunch with me.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.392
Uh, that's a bit different.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.061
You did already know her
from section.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.762
I know, also it was just lunch.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.564
Dinner's a bigger deal
because it's at night.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.732
Exactly.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.567
Okay, uh, we'll be in touch.

20:36.569 --> 20:37.735
Josh?
Yeah.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.736
(phone rings)

20:38.738 --> 20:39.570
Hello.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.905
Oh, finally. Josh Greenberg?

20:40.907 --> 20:42.440
Mr. President?
Uh, congratulations.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.841
You are an inspiration
to men everywhere.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.009
Thanks, buddy.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.077
I really appreciate that.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.445
When I met Michelle,

20:47.447 --> 20:48.846
I was rocking a Jamiroquai hat.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.182
Oh.
Honestly, it was a crutch.

20:51.184 --> 20:52.583
Uh, you proved the
old-fashioned way still works.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.086
This Tinder stuff,

20:55.088 --> 20:56.754
I just don't get it.
I'll let you go.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.789
JOSH:
Thanks, buddy.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.758
(shutters clicking)

21:00.760 --> 21:01.926
Wow.
Right here!

21:01.928 --> 21:03.794
Wow, this is so cool.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.596
Hey, hey, wow, sorry.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.499
(reporters shouting)

21:12.704 --> 21:14.639
Josh!

21:14.641 --> 21:15.973
Joshie!

21:15.975 --> 21:17.541
I'm Tom, T-O-M.

21:17.543 --> 21:18.609
This is Patti.

21:18.611 --> 21:19.977
Mom, proud mom.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.213
Hitler ain't got shit
on you, dude.

21:22.215 --> 21:24.548
Okay, thank-thank you.
