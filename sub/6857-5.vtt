00:16.317 --> 00:17.483
<i>Counterattack!</i>

00:17.652 --> 00:19.878
<i>With the clone army stretched
in a desperate attempt</i>

00:20.003 --> 00:22.191
<i>to engage
General Grievous' starfleet,</i>

00:22.316 --> 00:24.576
<i>Separatist planets
that were once thought secure</i>

00:24.701 --> 00:27.201
<i>are now rising up
against the Republic.</i>

00:27.440 --> 00:30.443
<i>On Geonosis,
Separatist leader Poggle the Lesser,</i>

00:30.749 --> 00:33.109
<i>safe in his newly
ray-shielded factories,</i>

00:33.234 --> 00:35.433
<i>creates thousands
of terrible new weapons</i>

00:35.558 --> 00:39.558
<i>which march off the assembly line
against the outnumbered clone army.</i>

00:39.956 --> 00:43.856
<i>The Jedi, resolute in their effort
to restore order to the Republic</i>

00:44.211 --> 00:46.911
<i>mount a massive invasion
to retake Geonosis</i>

00:47.272 --> 00:49.665
<i>and shut down
Poggle's factories of terror</i>

00:49.790 --> 00:51.140
<i>once and for all.</i>

00:53.178 --> 00:55.678
I cannot believe
we're back here again.

00:55.991 --> 00:57.391
It is unfortunate.

00:57.655 --> 00:59.516
The resistance
from the native Geonosians

00:59.641 --> 01:01.429
was stronger than we anticipated.

01:01.554 --> 01:04.489
The same can be said
for their loyalty to Count Dooku.

01:04.614 --> 01:06.715
A fact that is often overlooked.

01:06.926 --> 01:08.026
You're late.

01:08.304 --> 01:09.304
Sorry, Master.

01:09.429 --> 01:12.038
Ahsoka and I were busy
routing the seppies near Dorin.

01:12.369 --> 01:15.037
My squadron alone had 55 kills.

01:15.502 --> 01:18.062
Yeah, but mine had 76.

01:18.421 --> 01:19.421
Show-off.

01:19.653 --> 01:21.864
I'm glad
you two are enjoying yourselves.

01:21.989 --> 01:24.317
It's just a little
friendly competion, Master.

01:24.442 --> 01:25.718
Nothing to worry about.

01:25.886 --> 01:29.140
What I worry about is the way
this war seems to be drawing out

01:29.265 --> 01:31.010
with no end in sight.

01:31.267 --> 01:35.271
Which is why it is crucial our invasion
of Geonosis meets with success.

01:35.480 --> 01:36.480
Agreed.

01:37.003 --> 01:39.816
Contact the Outer Rim command.
We're ready for our briefing.

01:40.105 --> 01:42.155
They're already waiting for us.

01:42.912 --> 01:44.268
Our ships are in position,

01:44.393 --> 01:47.406
and we are ready to begin
our campaign against the Geonosians.

01:47.730 --> 01:50.785
<i>And what about Poggle?
Any report on his location?</i>

01:50.953 --> 01:54.353
It seems he's holed up
at the primary droid foundry here.

01:54.707 --> 01:57.000
The factory is protected
by a shield generator.

01:57.125 --> 02:00.226
Anakin, Ki-Adi, and I shall attempt
a three-pronged attack

02:00.351 --> 02:03.973
through their defense lines to a
staging area just short of the shield.

02:04.098 --> 02:06.676
Once we have landed, we Shall
knock out the shield generator

02:07.031 --> 02:08.881
That is our primary target.

02:09.138 --> 02:13.038
<i>Isn't it risky committing three
generals to one area of the attack?</i>

02:13.875 --> 02:17.186
<i>If something went wrong,
we could be dealt a serious blow.</i>

02:17.354 --> 02:20.104
<i>To ensure that rise again
Geonosis does not,</i>

02:20.511 --> 02:22.161
<i>capture Poggle we must.</i>

02:22.678 --> 02:23.678
<i>Of course.</i>

02:24.055 --> 02:27.505
<i>As always, I shall leave
the strategy to you, Master Jedi.</i>

02:27.750 --> 02:29.365
Our thanks, Chancellor.

02:29.533 --> 02:31.449
<i>May the Force be with you.</i>

02:33.365 --> 02:34.415
Good, Cody.

02:34.731 --> 02:37.531
These are the coordinates
for the rendezvous.

02:37.806 --> 02:39.739
When we hit the ground,
we'll create a perimeter.

02:39.864 --> 02:42.637
Getting past their defenses here
will be the trick.

02:42.762 --> 02:45.599
General Mundi will come across
the defensive lines from the north.

02:45.724 --> 02:47.938
We will make our assault
through the middle.

02:48.063 --> 02:49.377
General Skywalker

02:49.502 --> 02:52.500
will make his attack
on the defensive lines from the south,

02:52.625 --> 02:56.292
And we will meet at the
rendezvous point at 0700 exactly

02:56.810 --> 02:58.414
If we meet with strong resistance

02:58.539 --> 03:00.442
and are forced down away
from the landing zone,

03:00.567 --> 03:04.483
hold out until we join our forces
before attacking the shield generator.

03:04.651 --> 03:07.111
Their front lines
are heavily fortified.

03:07.279 --> 03:09.697
Look at that giant wall
with all the gun emplacements.

03:10.243 --> 03:12.283
That won't be easy to get past.

03:12.501 --> 03:14.813
Don't worry.
We're not going anywhere near that.

03:14.938 --> 03:15.799
Come now.

03:15.924 --> 03:18.724
What happened to all
the enthusiasm I saw earlier?

03:18.849 --> 03:20.273
Don't worry about us.

03:20.398 --> 03:24.045
You just make sure you get yourself
to that landing zone in one piece.

03:24.337 --> 03:26.812
I shall be waiting for you
when you finally arrive.

03:26.937 --> 03:30.687
<i>Gentlemen, if you are quite finished
we have a battle to begin.</i>

03:31.252 --> 03:32.352
Quite right.

03:32.691 --> 03:35.891
Cody, prep the gunships.
I'll meet you in the hangar.

03:57.913 --> 04:01.299
No, sir, I wasn't involved
in the first assault on Geonosis.

04:01.424 --> 04:02.879
You didn't miss much.

04:03.004 --> 04:07.202
Last time, I was chained to a pole and
attacked by several humongous monsters.

04:07.438 --> 04:09.826
That sounds... entertaining.

04:10.176 --> 04:11.176
It was...

04:11.356 --> 04:12.806
for the Geonosians.

04:53.883 --> 04:56.033
- We all ready, Rex?
- Yes, sir.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.014
General Kenobi is already under way.

04:58.182 --> 05:00.641
He's got a head start.
We'll have to catch up.

05:04.624 --> 05:05.938
Good luck, General.

05:06.438 --> 05:08.488
There is no such thing as luck.

05:22.201 --> 05:24.290
Good thing those bugs can't aim.

05:44.270 --> 05:47.626
<i>- The flak is too heavy.
- We're down. Repeat, down.</i>

05:47.751 --> 05:49.101
<i>Location, five...</i>

05:49.374 --> 05:51.442
I just lost contact
with Skywalker's team.

05:52.125 --> 05:54.675
Come on, get up!
We have to keep moving.

05:58.223 --> 05:59.473
Here they come.

06:00.135 --> 06:01.285
Watch it. Watch it!

06:09.503 --> 06:11.654
They're falling back. Come on!

06:19.304 --> 06:21.138
Get the tanks on the ground now!

06:24.643 --> 06:26.811
Cody, get the tanks down.
Come in, Cody.

06:30.482 --> 06:32.682
<i>Cody, come in! Get the tanks down!</i>

06:32.944 --> 06:35.544
Copy that.
Pilot, begin landing sequence.

06:35.779 --> 06:38.072
Copy that, commander.
Have fun down there.

06:47.763 --> 06:49.125
Move it! Move it!

06:49.294 --> 06:51.147
- Here they come.
- Bugs incoming.

06:51.272 --> 06:52.671
Man down! Man down!

06:52.796 --> 06:54.922
General Kenobi, don't land.
The zone is hot.

06:56.591 --> 06:58.551
But there's nowhere else to go.

07:05.601 --> 07:07.501
We're hit. We're going down.

07:12.463 --> 07:13.774
Brace yourselves!

07:34.817 --> 07:36.338
What are our losses, captain?

07:36.635 --> 07:38.192
We got hit pretty hard.

07:38.317 --> 07:40.396
I think only Kenobi's forces
made it through the flak

07:40.521 --> 07:43.095
- to the landing zone.
- And what about Skywalker?

07:43.281 --> 07:46.352
Captain Rex reported they're still
in the middle of a firefight.

07:46.477 --> 07:47.877
Skywalker's tanks are gone,

07:48.002 --> 07:50.904
and they're trying to contact
General Kenobi's forces for support.

07:51.029 --> 07:53.728
In the meantime, they'll press
on to the rendezvous point.

07:53.853 --> 07:54.853
Very well.

07:55.348 --> 07:57.448
Load the injured onto the tanks.

07:57.752 --> 07:59.236
We'll make for that ridge.

07:59.361 --> 08:01.157
With any luck,
we can meet up with Skywalker

08:01.282 --> 08:03.382
on his way to Kenobi's position.

08:10.127 --> 08:13.191
- I'll speak with General Skywalker.
- Rex, what's the word?

08:13.316 --> 08:16.255
- Can Obi-Wan send support or not?
- I don't think so, sir.

08:16.380 --> 08:18.816
Cody says General Kenobi
never reached the landing site.

08:18.941 --> 08:21.403
- They think his gunship got shot down.
- Great.

08:21.528 --> 08:24.782
The one time I actually ask Obi-Wan
for help, he's nowhere to be found.

08:24.907 --> 08:27.139
What if something happened
to General Kenobi?

08:27.264 --> 08:30.139
- He could be injured or...
- No time for that kind of talk.

08:30.264 --> 08:33.114
We need to mobilize now.
Get the men together.

08:33.318 --> 08:35.272
- We're gonna rush the guns.
- Yes, sir.

08:35.768 --> 08:37.366
Ahsoka, you're with me.

08:37.491 --> 08:39.299
We need to give Rex cover
when we attack.

08:39.424 --> 08:41.325
Got it.
Just give the word.

08:42.212 --> 08:43.504
I'm worried about him too.

08:43.629 --> 08:45.753
But you have to keep your mind
in the here and now,

08:45.878 --> 08:48.494
otherwise we'll never
be able to help Obi-Wan.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.437
- All here, sir.
- Ready?

08:53.796 --> 08:55.696
Take 'em out.
Take 'em all.

09:01.884 --> 09:03.946
Not good.
The bugs are splitting up.

09:04.071 --> 09:06.645
- Boil reporting as ordered, sir.
- Waxer reporting as ordered, sir.

09:06.770 --> 09:09.598
We have a downed gunship 5 klicks east.
We believe it's General Kenobi's.

09:09.766 --> 09:12.309
I need you to get out there
and check for survivors.

09:27.875 --> 09:30.004
Why do we always get
the fun missions?

09:30.129 --> 09:31.648
Tthis isn't the fun part.

09:31.773 --> 09:34.473
Getting back to the square
is the fun part.

09:38.420 --> 09:40.114
Am I glad to see you.

09:40.239 --> 09:42.464
Trapper and I
are the only ones still alive.

09:42.632 --> 09:44.831
Good to see you, sir.
Commander Cody's established

09:44.956 --> 09:47.561
the square just beyond this position.
The bugs are on the move

09:47.686 --> 09:49.513
and trying to surround us
as we speak, sir.

09:52.767 --> 09:54.300
They've got the General.

09:54.425 --> 09:57.886
AT-TE 636,
lay down cover fire at point 3-5.

10:08.091 --> 10:09.991
Take it down!
Take it down!

10:16.694 --> 10:19.944
- Are you injured, General?
- No, nothing too serious.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.984
What's the situation here?

10:22.859 --> 10:24.136
We've got no air cover,

10:24.261 --> 10:26.383
two generals on the ground
beyond our position,

10:26.508 --> 10:28.053
and a mess of bugs surrounding us.

10:28.178 --> 10:30.656
The enemy was more than prepared
for our attack, sir.

10:30.781 --> 10:32.408
They knew our every move.

10:32.533 --> 10:34.874
I'm sure General Skywalker
and General Mundi

10:34.999 --> 10:36.518
will make it to our position.

10:36.686 --> 10:40.052
We just have to make sure
we're still here when they arrive.

11:02.212 --> 11:03.925
Negative, captain.
We will be unable

11:04.050 --> 11:05.804
to provide any air support
at this time.

11:06.038 --> 11:07.328
I understand that, sir.

11:07.453 --> 11:09.231
But we have 3 attack forces
on the ground

11:09.356 --> 11:10.928
and only one at the landing zone.

11:11.096 --> 11:13.740
This is a planetary-wide
invasion, captain.

11:13.865 --> 11:15.868
If I devote resources
to your position,

11:15.993 --> 11:18.811
it will mean sacrificing
other areas of the campaign.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.557
All we can do at this time
is help you find General Skywalker.

11:21.682 --> 11:22.865
All right, sir.

11:22.990 --> 11:25.275
I'll report to the General.
Commander jet out.

11:25.659 --> 11:28.209
Give me every fighter
you can scrape up.

11:28.849 --> 11:31.156
Have you located
General Skywalker's position?

11:31.324 --> 11:34.076
We think he's somewhere
along the eastern barrier.

11:34.244 --> 11:35.619
That's not a barrier.

11:35.994 --> 11:37.037
It's a fortress.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.438
Careful, men, careful.

11:47.962 --> 11:51.805
Well, this is another fine mess
you've gotten us into.

11:51.930 --> 11:54.358
What?
Hey, it's not my fault.

11:54.483 --> 11:56.531
You were supposed
to study the holomaps.

11:56.656 --> 11:57.656
I did!

11:58.129 --> 12:01.890
Remember when I reminded you
about the giant wall,

12:02.015 --> 12:06.048
and you said, "Don't worry, Snips.
We won't be anywhere near that. "

12:06.173 --> 12:08.136
Just get ready to climb.

12:09.570 --> 12:12.178
General, I left a squad
to protect the tanks.

12:12.303 --> 12:14.916
Are you sure this is the
shortest way to the landing zone?

12:15.041 --> 12:16.925
No, I'm not sure, commander.

12:17.050 --> 12:19.350
All I can do is trust my instincts.

12:33.178 --> 12:35.929
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I have a wing vibration up ahead.

12:56.669 --> 13:00.317
Don't stop. We must push on.
Forward!

13:01.687 --> 13:04.563
- So what's the plan, General?
- Just keep us covered, Rex.

13:04.688 --> 13:07.192
There's too much laser fire
for all of us to make the climb.

13:07.317 --> 13:08.831
Ahsoka and I will handle this.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.964
Just be ready
when that wall comes down.

13:58.555 --> 14:00.693
How many droids
have you shot down so far?

14:00.818 --> 14:03.568
- 25.
- You're falling behind.

14:04.003 --> 14:04.819
Let's go.

14:21.911 --> 14:24.611
Focus on the droids
on the top of the wall.

14:31.383 --> 14:32.270
Man down!

15:01.282 --> 15:02.412
Look for a hatch.

15:02.537 --> 15:05.037
We need to put the explosives
inside the wall.

15:06.350 --> 15:07.177
Found one.

15:32.486 --> 15:33.940
- Did you get them?
- Catch.

15:37.811 --> 15:38.904
Come on, Rex.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.172
Up and away.

15:46.207 --> 15:47.207
Help!

16:08.852 --> 16:10.952
Next time, just tell me to jump.

16:11.197 --> 16:13.147
Now, where's the fun in that?

16:13.481 --> 16:15.537
Come on, we can't keep
Obi-Wan waiting.

16:15.662 --> 16:17.712
You heard him, lads.
Let's go!

16:27.620 --> 16:30.414
We're almost through.
Bring in the flame throwers.

16:40.925 --> 16:42.325
Look, what's that?

16:51.352 --> 16:53.186
Master Mundi, do you read me?

16:53.354 --> 16:56.074
We are here, Skywalker.
We took a slight detour

16:56.199 --> 16:58.172
that put us out of communications
for a bit.

16:58.297 --> 17:00.439
This has been
a day for detours, Master.

17:00.564 --> 17:04.214
Indeed. But now the road is clear.
I can see the landing zone.

17:04.977 --> 17:06.491
It does not look good.

17:07.262 --> 17:08.952
Can you get me Admiral Yularen?

17:12.824 --> 17:14.595
<i>Admiral, we're
at the breaking point.</i>

17:14.720 --> 17:16.586
<i>You've got to get
some fighters down here.</i>

17:16.711 --> 17:20.560
You are in luck, General Skywalker.
I have one squadron available.

17:28.852 --> 17:31.241
Retreat!
Go, go, go, go!

17:40.363 --> 17:42.863
Every shot counts!
Give it all you got!

17:44.825 --> 17:46.031
Reinforcements!

17:46.199 --> 17:48.299
The reinforcements have arrived!

17:57.068 --> 17:58.470
Go, go, go, go!

17:58.942 --> 18:00.292
Move it! Move it!

18:00.417 --> 18:03.517
- You heard him, lads, let's go!
- Up to the front!

18:04.092 --> 18:06.002
- Come on!
- Hurry, hurry!

18:06.247 --> 18:08.647
- There they are.
- Move it, move it!

18:10.390 --> 18:11.592
Master Kenobi.

18:13.309 --> 18:14.859
What happened to you?

18:15.395 --> 18:17.585
I might ask you the same question.

18:17.710 --> 18:21.233
Our combined forces should be enough
to destroy the shield generator.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.653
Anakin, you'll need to take
a small squad through the shield,

18:24.821 --> 18:27.593
as close as you can get
to their gun emplacements.

18:27.718 --> 18:28.575
From there,

18:28.700 --> 18:30.791
you'll be able to temporarily jam
their scanners

18:30.916 --> 18:33.745
so they are unable to target
the incoming tanks.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.857
Once the tanks knock out the shield,

18:35.982 --> 18:39.209
Master Mundi can bring the rest
of the troops in with the gunships.

18:40.102 --> 18:41.721
Consider it done, Master.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.010
All units are in position, sir.

18:52.021 --> 18:54.271
Tell Skywalker to start the attack.

18:54.559 --> 18:55.909
Begin the attack.

19:35.718 --> 19:38.568
Let's jam their scanners.
Droid poppers ready.

19:45.514 --> 19:46.959
Looks like it's working.

19:47.084 --> 19:49.584
It won't last long.
Bring up the tanks.

20:31.887 --> 20:34.157
So, Master, what was your total?

20:35.127 --> 20:36.414
Not now, Ahsoka.

20:36.539 --> 20:39.616
Come on. Are you afraid
you lost this time?

20:39.959 --> 20:42.804
Fine. 55, that's my count.
And you?

20:44.906 --> 20:45.752
60.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.386
Looks like I won.

20:48.739 --> 20:51.681
Yeah, but I called in
the air strike. Tie.

20:52.426 --> 20:53.826
You're impossible.

20:54.554 --> 20:57.180
I'll never understand
how you can simplify these battles

20:57.305 --> 20:58.955
into some kind of game.

21:02.142 --> 21:05.074
Take care of yourselves.
I expect to see both of you back here

21:05.199 --> 21:07.399
by the time I've destroyed
the main factory.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.097
We shall do our best.

21:09.222 --> 21:10.777
65, Skywalker.

21:11.320 --> 21:12.570
- I'm sorry?

21:12.738 --> 21:14.489
My total. 65.

21:15.547 --> 21:16.899
So what do I win?

21:21.872 --> 21:24.272
My everlasting respect,
Master Mundi.

21:25.669 --> 21:28.069
That is a gift
Anakin rarely bestows,

21:28.921 --> 21:30.071
I assure you.

21:31.305 --> 21:37.516
