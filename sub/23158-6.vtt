WEBVTT

01:35.504 --> 01:38.756
... the creator and maker
of mankind,

01:38.801 --> 01:44.346
and we are mortal, formed of the earth,
and unto earth shall we return.

01:44.395 --> 01:48.526
For so Thou didst ordain
when Thou createst me, saying:

01:48.569 --> 01:53.152
Dust thou art,
and unto dust shalt thou return.

01:55.039 --> 01:56.072
Amen.

02:05.141 --> 02:08.228
- Bless you, my child.
- Thank you.

02:23.467 --> 02:25.176
Excuse me.

02:25.220 --> 02:28.924
- You must be Jennifer.
- I'm Jenny.

02:28.977 --> 02:32.978
- Do I know you, sir?
- I wish you did, my child.

02:34.070 --> 02:37.607
I'm the man
who should have been your father.

02:50.224 --> 02:53.228
- Excuse me, please.
- Yes?

02:53.272 --> 02:56.061
By any chance are you an official
of this club?

02:56.110 --> 02:59.862
Not exactly, but I dare say
I'm not entirely without influence.

02:59.909 --> 03:01.986
How may I be of service?

03:02.038 --> 03:05.955
That man. Well, he's staring at me.

03:09.092 --> 03:10.718
Exactly which one?

03:10.762 --> 03:14.098
The one who appears to
have gone out in his underwear.

03:14.143 --> 03:18.014
Ah, yes. Rest assured,
I'll attend to it immediately.

03:25.038 --> 03:31.129
Either the small businessman has to expand
or get demolished. I move up or move out.

03:31.175 --> 03:36.173
Did you ever consider buying
a balsawood kit and some rubber bands?

03:36.225 --> 03:40.690
- I'm serious. This ain't funny.
- If I may interrupt this assemblage.

03:40.734 --> 03:44.569
- Why don't you pull up a chair?
- How about a beer?

03:44.616 --> 03:46.776
A complaint has been lodged with me

03:46.828 --> 03:50.960
regarding both unbecoming behaviour
and violations of our dress code.

03:51.003 --> 03:52.664
I'm clean.

03:52.714 --> 03:55.967
The guilty party
defends himself before being accused.

03:56.012 --> 03:59.218
Thomas is usually accused
before there's a complaint.

03:59.268 --> 04:00.811
That came out wrong.

04:00.854 --> 04:05.900
Apart from your aggressively offensive attire,
there's a much more serious matter.

04:05.947 --> 04:08.820
That obviously well-bred young lady

04:08.869 --> 04:11.956
has complained
that you've been leering at her.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.327
What? Where?

04:16.007 --> 04:18.547
You been giving the radar eye
to that woman?

04:18.595 --> 04:22.810
Man, you got to be crazy.
That chick is instant frostbite.

04:22.853 --> 04:25.311
That girl? I never even noticed her.

04:25.357 --> 04:28.029
Methinks he doth protest too much.

04:28.071 --> 04:32.951
There is a simple, very practical,
easy way to end this all.

04:32.997 --> 04:38.458
I will just go over and apologise for anything
she thought may have happened. OK?

04:38.507 --> 04:40.584
Everybody happy?

04:45.394 --> 04:48.647
Excuse me.
That gentleman over there, Higgins.

04:48.692 --> 04:53.073
He says I somehow offended you
by staring, which I wasn't, really.

04:53.117 --> 04:59.540
But now that I'm here, and I've met you,
I really wish I had been. You're quite lovely.

05:01.132 --> 05:04.301
Thank you for your courtesy
and the compliment.

05:06.391 --> 05:08.765
My name's Thomas Magnum.

05:10.524 --> 05:12.399
Oh.

05:14.490 --> 05:16.780
Listen, um, if you're new here,

05:16.827 --> 05:20.365
I thought that maybe I could give you
a tour of the club,

05:20.417 --> 05:22.542
introduce you to some people.

05:22.588 --> 05:26.375
Well, that's very thoughtful
but I'm quite comfortable already.

05:27.305 --> 05:30.012
Would you excuse me?

05:32.063 --> 05:34.058
Right.

05:35.695 --> 05:38.069
It was swell talking to you.

05:42.165 --> 05:44.493
Well, did you make a date, Casanova?

05:44.545 --> 05:48.380
Are you serious? That was
a major brush-off, if I ever seen one.

05:48.427 --> 05:53.057
It is obviously a very sad case. She has
a deep psychological hatred for men.

05:53.102 --> 05:57.733
Now, I knew that instinctively when I sat
down so I simply apologised and left.

05:57.777 --> 06:02.490
Really? She seemed extremely
well-adjusted and perceptive to me.

06:02.536 --> 06:06.288
All I know is I tried
to make her as welcome as possible.

06:06.335 --> 06:09.504
And she was so polite, she was rude.

06:10.050 --> 06:12.543
Sit down, have a beer and forget her.

06:12.596 --> 06:15.933
Who's remembering her?
There are too many normal women

06:15.978 --> 06:19.147
to waste time on ones
with psychological problems.

06:19.192 --> 06:24.238
Somebody busted through that deep
psychological barrier. Check it out.

06:26.205 --> 06:30.206
That's just cos they're both British.
Probably comparing accents.

06:30.254 --> 06:35.929
No, sir. Why don't you just admit it?
Higgins has just one-upped you.

06:35.973 --> 06:38.680
She's not even Thomas's type
and you know it.

06:38.728 --> 06:41.435
- She stopped breathing or something?
- TC !

06:41.483 --> 06:44.272
He never struck out before and you know it.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.150
Rick, come on.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.369
$50 says Magnum gets a date
before Higgins gets her name.

06:50.750 --> 06:55.083
- Put your money where your mouth is !
- That's it. I'm going swimming.

06:55.133 --> 06:57.211
Put your money where your mouth isl

07:00.518 --> 07:06.146
'By the end of my swim, I'd completely
forgotten that beautiful but hostile girl.

07:06.195 --> 07:08.735
'Only a crazy man goes looking for trouble.

07:08.783 --> 07:13.413
'And where women are concerned,
I've always been proud of being sane.'

07:30.197 --> 07:33.035
Well, hello again. What a coincidence.

07:33.078 --> 07:36.663
- I beg your pardon?
- Running into you again, on the way out.

07:36.709 --> 07:38.918
Oh. Yes.

07:39.590 --> 07:44.006
- How are you enjoying your visit?
- Awfully, thank you.

07:46.644 --> 07:48.104
Bye.

07:53.991 --> 07:56.365
'I could tell I was making progress.

07:56.412 --> 08:00.199
'Which meant she wasn't unfriendly.
Only shy.

08:02.465 --> 08:05.919
'When I write my book on how to be
a top private investigator,

08:05.971 --> 08:09.094
'I'm going to include two rules
on how to tail a car.

08:09.144 --> 08:12.516
'The first is, when you choose
a nondescript car for tailing,

08:12.567 --> 08:15.356
'don't pick one so nondescript it's obvious.

08:15.405 --> 08:17.946
'The guys following her
were so unnoticeable,

08:17.994 --> 08:20.617
'it was like they had a red flag on the hood.

08:20.665 --> 08:25.130
'The second rule is, don't get so
busy tailing, you forget to look behind you.

08:25.173 --> 08:28.177
'These yo-yos had no idea
I was behind them.'

09:00.948 --> 09:05.079
Hi, guys. Your motor's running.
Don't you listen to the police?

09:05.122 --> 09:08.624
They said it's a no-no
to leave your keys in the ignition.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.760
That's itl

09:14.806 --> 09:17.513
That's right, lady. You call the cops.

09:21.569 --> 09:24.608
I'd make a run for it if I were you.

09:35.887 --> 09:38.724
'One bad thing I've noticed about yo-yos.

09:38.767 --> 09:42.221
'As a group, they don't have
much of a sense of humour.'

10:02.314 --> 10:04.641
What's happened to the windscreen?

10:04.693 --> 10:07.613
- Did the oil pump explode?
- May I explain later?

10:07.657 --> 10:10.150
Are you aware it's all over the bonnet?

10:10.203 --> 10:12.910
Of course I am.
I was attacked by two yo-yos.

10:12.958 --> 10:17.209
It's not motor oil. It's not viscous enough.
This will destroy the lacquer.

10:17.258 --> 10:21.389
Wait a minute. Do you realise
I'm telling you about being nearly killed

10:21.432 --> 10:23.557
and you're worried about paint?

10:23.603 --> 10:26.606
And the side-view mirror
has been sheared off.

10:26.650 --> 10:31.280
Forget your plan to file an insurance claim
under Robin Masters' policy.

10:31.325 --> 10:34.911
- Would you get out of my way?
- This kind of reckless conduct...

10:34.957 --> 10:38.910
Out of my way before I run you down
and enjoy itl

10:43.389 --> 10:44.849
Magnum.

10:44.892 --> 10:49.225
You're clad only in your undershorts.
I find that just a trifle casual.

10:49.275 --> 10:52.729
What do you think I used
to wipe off the bloody windscreen -

10:52.781 --> 10:55.904
the windshield
so I could drive the ruddy car?

11:13.277 --> 11:16.031
Good afternoon, my dear.

11:16.074 --> 11:19.197
I, erm, believe you've met Miss Chapman.

11:19.247 --> 11:20.493
Yesl

11:20.541 --> 11:22.500
Uh, yes.

11:22.544 --> 11:25.583
The yo-yos that I was after were after her.

11:25.633 --> 11:28.637
- Is this what passes for American humour?
- I'm sorry.

11:28.681 --> 11:32.764
At the service station I thought you were
going for help when you saw them.

11:32.813 --> 11:35.389
- I stopped at two stations, for petrol.
- Yes.

11:35.443 --> 11:38.945
- The first was unattended, the second...
- Yesl

11:38.991 --> 11:42.862
Well, I'm afraid I didn't see you.
I'm sure I'd remember.

11:44.585 --> 11:47.624
These bully boys,
exactly what do they look like?

11:47.674 --> 11:50.001
One of them was a sumo wrestler.

11:52.099 --> 11:54.093
And the other was a midget or a dwarf.

11:54.144 --> 11:56.982
- What?
- A midget or a dwarfl

11:57.025 --> 12:02.154
Really? No bearded ladies, trapeze artists?
Where was the rest of the circus?

12:02.201 --> 12:05.619
How lovely of you to come to tea.
Staff is setting it up.

12:05.665 --> 12:08.205
I know, Higgins, you don't believe me.

12:10.549 --> 12:12.627
Of course I do. If you'll excuse us.

12:12.678 --> 12:15.468
Forget it. Just forget it.

12:15.517 --> 12:21.108
Just forget the whole thing. I'm not in my
underwear. There's no oil on the car.

12:23.031 --> 12:25.738
Just forget it. You think I'm crazy?

12:26.621 --> 12:31.916
I'm gonna go clean up. Clean up the car.
No, I'm not cleaning up the car...

12:39.728 --> 12:43.599
'I had Rick check out the car
that had followed Jennifer. It was stolen.

12:43.652 --> 12:47.783
'Now the only question I had was
who was after Jennifer. And why?

12:54.880 --> 12:57.191
'That wasn't my only question for her

12:57.243 --> 13:02.455
'but given my professional responsibility,
it was the only one I could ask.

13:02.503 --> 13:05.257
'Of course, I was too experienced
to do it directly.'

13:05.299 --> 13:07.673
Hello there.

13:09.474 --> 13:12.430
Great day. You been in the water?

13:12.479 --> 13:17.359
- I'm afraid I don't swim.
- You don't swim? In Hawaii?

13:17.405 --> 13:19.863
You're missing what it's all about.

13:19.910 --> 13:23.661
Really? At home
it's either too cold or too crowded.

13:23.708 --> 13:28.955
Robin Masters keeps swimsuits around the
house for guests. Why not put one on?

13:29.010 --> 13:32.346
- You don't give up, do you?
- What?

13:32.391 --> 13:34.966
- No, look, it's not that.
- It's all right.

13:35.480 --> 13:42.022
Jonathan told me about your unfortunate
compulsion where women are concerned.

13:42.910 --> 13:44.785
Are you gonna listen to me?

13:44.830 --> 13:48.582
I'm sorry, but my afternoon itinerary
is already scheduled.

13:48.629 --> 13:53.425
I'll be real direct. Maybe you don't believe
anything went on at that gas station

13:53.471 --> 13:57.175
but I've got the aches to prove it.
So I want you to tell me something.

13:57.228 --> 14:00.148
Somebody's out to get you. Why?

14:00.943 --> 14:03.483
You know, maybe I could help.

14:15.804 --> 14:20.137
I'm all out of red wine,
so I'm gonna borrow some from...

14:23.735 --> 14:26.311
Higgins, what the devil are you doing?

14:26.365 --> 14:29.452
What I'm doing should be obvious
to any civilised person.

14:29.496 --> 14:32.499
But for your information,
I'm practising the rumba,

14:32.543 --> 14:38.135
a dance that requires balance, coordination,
and a lightness of both foot and spirit.

14:38.178 --> 14:42.511
Out of the blue you just decided to put on
the old patent leathers and rumba?

14:42.562 --> 14:44.936
Be a good chap. Help me slip into this.

14:44.983 --> 14:48.604
- As a matter of fact...
- Take a breath. A small one.

14:48.656 --> 14:51.695
Tonight is the Commodore's Ball
at the yacht club.

14:51.745 --> 14:54.702
As an honorary vice commodore,
I must attend.

14:54.751 --> 14:58.834
And rumba with some
of those blue-haired ladies, I suppose.

14:58.883 --> 15:02.635
As a matter of fact,
I'm escorting Miss Chapman tonight.

15:03.642 --> 15:07.857
Jennifer? You're taking Jennifer?
As a sort of a friend of the family

15:07.900 --> 15:10.475
so you can introduce her to the best people?

15:10.530 --> 15:13.319
Be a good lad and lend a hand
with the jacket.

15:13.368 --> 15:19.376
Miss Chapman has confided that she finds
a man in a dinner jacket rather irresistible.

15:21.091 --> 15:24.213
You mean this is a date? A real date?

15:26.726 --> 15:30.312
It may be rather late
when I get home tonight.

15:31.151 --> 15:36.576
So I'll try not to accelerate as I pass the
guesthouse, unlike some people I know.

15:36.619 --> 15:40.572
- TC put you up to this, didn't he?
- Now, one final point.

15:40.627 --> 15:45.292
There's a half-bottle of Beaujolais in
the kitchen I've been using for cooking.

15:45.344 --> 15:47.837
It should be adequate for your palate.

15:47.890 --> 15:52.971
For security reasons, I changed the lock
on the wine cellar. Good night.

15:58.785 --> 16:02.204
10, 20, 30, 40.

16:02.250 --> 16:05.503
- You sure about this?
- I have definite confirmation.

16:05.547 --> 16:09.383
- Just keep counting.
- The rumba? Who does the rumba today?

16:09.430 --> 16:12.433
Nobody, since José "Eye-turbi"
quit doing movies.

16:12.477 --> 16:15.599
Iturbi, and it just doesn't figure.

16:15.649 --> 16:19.271
- It doesn't make any sense.
- Nobody likes a sore loser.

16:21.076 --> 16:24.744
Have your hands fallen asleep
clutching that bankroll?

16:24.791 --> 16:27.997
- Will you please just keep counting?
- I got some side bets.

16:28.047 --> 16:31.751
Maybe you can help me win 'em back.

16:31.804 --> 16:34.558
Maybe it was your moustache
that turned her off.

16:34.601 --> 16:38.020
Try trimming it down.
Or take hand-kissing lessons.

16:38.066 --> 16:42.067
- For you, Casanova.
-  Casanova?

16:43.325 --> 16:45.403
- Uh...
- Magnum speaking.

16:45.454 --> 16:48.577
'You want to know the truth
about Jennifer Chapman? '

16:48.627 --> 16:51.001
- Who is this?
- 'Who she is, where she's from.

16:51.048 --> 16:53.837
'Most of all, why she is seeing Higgins.'

16:53.886 --> 16:56.640
If you've got information, give it to me.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.307
'Meet me at the Valley of the Temples
at 3:00.

16:59.355 --> 17:02.809
'I don't need to tell you to come alone, do I? '

17:04.698 --> 17:08.069
'I know what you're thinking.
I was thinking it, too.

17:08.121 --> 17:10.743
'When I write
my private investigator manual,

17:10.791 --> 17:14.247
'there'll be a chapter
on The Oldest Tricks in the World.

17:14.299 --> 17:18.714
'This had to be one of them.
An anonymous tip? A mysterious meeting?

17:19.892 --> 17:23.976
'The only trouble with the oldest tricks is,
they usually work.

17:24.025 --> 17:26.815
'When dealing with one of the oldest tricks,

17:26.864 --> 17:30.070
'it helps to think of
a couple of tricks yourself.

17:33.501 --> 17:35.579
'Some tricks work better than others

17:35.630 --> 17:39.132
'but if you're gonna be
a world-class private investigator,

17:39.178 --> 17:44.259
'you gotta know where to forget about plans
and just make it up as you go along.'

19:38.272 --> 19:43.353
'One thing I knew, even guys like this
had a code. You don't shoot your partner.'

19:46.370 --> 19:48.448
Here you go.

20:02.657 --> 20:06.195
Please go on.
I'd very much like to know.

20:07.447 --> 20:10.118
It was such a long time ago.

20:10.160 --> 20:15.159
Yes, but it's important to me, Jonathan.
Everything about you is important.

20:16.171 --> 20:19.424
I was the youngest lad in our regiment.

20:20.346 --> 20:24.928
In those dark days when Hitler was winning,
everyone was young.

20:24.979 --> 20:28.351
We'd been going at it with Rommel
all over bloody Africa.

20:28.402 --> 20:32.320
One night, on patrol,
some Jerries surprised us.

20:32.368 --> 20:36.119
No more than the flick of the serpent's tail
as it slithered past us,

20:36.166 --> 20:40.998
but when it was over,
I was the only one in my group left alive.

20:41.885 --> 20:43.963
Three days in the desert.

20:44.014 --> 20:50.271
I've always blamed myself.
Somehow I should have saved...

20:54.951 --> 20:57.195
Then what happened?

20:57.247 --> 21:01.330
I was sent to a hospital in Cairo,
before being sent home.

21:01.379 --> 21:04.668
But you couldn't desert the regiment,
could you?

21:04.719 --> 21:09.052
I taught myself to type,
only two fingers because of the bandages,

21:09.102 --> 21:13.732
and got myself assigned as aide-de-camp
to an officer on the rise.

21:13.777 --> 21:17.992
And when you'd won him over,
completely indebted him to you,

21:18.035 --> 21:21.074
you got him to send you back
to your old post.

21:21.124 --> 21:24.293
You must have been the most attentive aide
in North Africa.

21:24.338 --> 21:29.218
It's true. But I would have done anything
to rejoin the lads.

21:30.642 --> 21:32.885
You're so clever, Jonathan.

21:36.444 --> 21:39.982
Well, as I said, it was a long time ago.

21:45.460 --> 21:48.214
It was a lifetime ago.

22:12.051 --> 22:16.218
Thank you for a lovely evening. I can't
remember when I've had such a good time.

22:17.060 --> 22:19.898
It was entirely my pleasure, I assure you.

22:20.650 --> 22:22.691
Good night.

22:23.363 --> 22:25.156
Jonathan.

22:25.200 --> 22:28.572
You may be the most perfect gentleman
I've ever known.

22:28.623 --> 22:33.788
But did anyone ever tell you
that too much perfection is boring?

23:01.475 --> 23:04.051
Jennifer. I'm in here.

23:06.860 --> 23:09.983
Well, tell me, how was your evening?

23:11.828 --> 23:15.365
It was lovely. Eliza Doolittle at the ball.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.622
Mm-hm.

23:17.672 --> 23:21.008
Are you hungry?
There's some delicious cold chicken.

23:22.764 --> 23:26.635
- Care for a brandy?
- No. Thanks. I'm fine, really.

23:26.688 --> 23:31.769
Really? That's hardly the most positive
endorsement I've ever heard.

23:34.020 --> 23:36.858
Would you care to tell me about it?

23:37.791 --> 23:40.367
I think I'm just tired.

23:41.739 --> 23:48.328
Now, look, my dear, if you're feeling at all
uncomfortable about our plan, you can quit.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.640
I'll, er, manage something else.

23:54.690 --> 23:56.566
On my own.

23:57.776 --> 23:59.735
- Truly.
- No.

24:00.052 --> 24:02.509
- I'll be all right.
- I don't think so.

24:02.606 --> 24:09.908
You see, I believe that you're such a warm,
generous girl, you're experiencing doubts.

24:10.884 --> 24:13.128
Second thoughts.

24:14.649 --> 24:18.103
You always know
what I'm thinking, don't you?

24:18.381 --> 24:21.265
Possibly because
I adored your mother so much.

24:21.880 --> 24:25.168
And you, my dear, are so very like her.

24:27.676 --> 24:33.304
It's just that Higgins doesn't seem
like an evil man. He has a caring quality.

24:33.329 --> 24:36.831
My dear, the truly evil ones
never seem to be so.

24:36.959 --> 24:41.958
That's why their effect on other people
is so... insidious.

24:41.983 --> 24:48.192
Jennifer, your mother was just as trusting,
just as willing to believe.

24:50.524 --> 24:52.982
And look what happened to her.

24:53.099 --> 24:55.259
To me.

24:56.292 --> 24:57.843
To us.

24:57.868 --> 25:01.703
I trust you about everything. You know I do.

25:02.049 --> 25:05.255
You are dearer to me than anyone else
in the world.

25:05.734 --> 25:08.358
I can't let anything happen to you,

25:08.562 --> 25:12.183
even in my quest for retribution.

25:12.800 --> 25:16.670
So if at any time you have second thoughts

25:16.935 --> 25:20.556
or feel compromised in any way,

25:21.772 --> 25:24.894
you must tell me and I'll stop.

25:25.702 --> 25:27.178
Hmm?

25:27.948 --> 25:29.601
Promise?

25:42.602 --> 25:44.477
Higgins.

25:47.611 --> 25:49.689
- Higgins?
- Magnum.

25:51.201 --> 25:53.279
You're waiting up for me?

25:53.330 --> 25:57.830
It's so droll I almost don't object
to the rather callow invasion of my privacy.

25:57.880 --> 26:00.373
Higgins, I want to talk to you about...

26:00.426 --> 26:02.800
Have you been pursuing a case?

26:02.847 --> 26:08.190
You look rather the worse for wear, although
I suppose the divorce business is fraught...

26:08.232 --> 26:09.941
Jennifer Chapman, Higgins.

26:10.862 --> 26:13.189
Jennifer Chapman?

26:13.241 --> 26:16.696
- What do you know about her?
- I beg your pardon?

26:16.748 --> 26:20.451
Who is she? Where is she from?
Why is she interested in you?

26:20.505 --> 26:24.126
Your insolent curiosity
has finally gone too far.

26:24.178 --> 26:27.217
A gentleman's code
does not permit him to ask...

26:27.267 --> 26:32.479
Hooray for the code. Two yo-yos tried to put
me away in a service station yesterday

26:32.527 --> 26:34.521
and today I ran into 'em again.

26:34.572 --> 26:37.576
The sumo wrestler and the midget.
Or a leprechaun?

26:37.619 --> 26:40.326
It was at the Valley of the Temples.

26:40.374 --> 26:43.129
You believe it's related to Miss Chapman?

26:43.171 --> 26:48.051
I went there because I got this phone call
and the voice said meet him at the temple

26:48.097 --> 26:51.054
because he had information about Jennifer.

26:51.103 --> 26:54.640
Dear me.
You almost had me believing it.

26:54.692 --> 26:58.230
But a sumo wrestler and a dwarf
and now this phone call.

26:58.282 --> 27:01.369
You've overplayed your hand just a bit.
Good night.

27:01.413 --> 27:06.210
Try to make it back to your quarters
without being waylaid by Chinese bandits.

27:06.255 --> 27:10.339
OKI Just forget about the fact
that somebody tried to kill me twice.

27:10.388 --> 27:16.016
Forget about the phone call.
Just tell me one thing and then I'll drop this.

27:16.817 --> 27:19.144
And I don't mean this unkindly.

27:20.406 --> 27:26.331
But I want you to think about this logically.
Why is a beautiful, desirable young woman

27:26.376 --> 27:31.042
who can have just about any man
in the Islands... pursuing you?

27:32.888 --> 27:35.178
The answer is obvious, old man.

27:35.225 --> 27:37.801
Logic is irrelevant.

27:37.855 --> 27:41.607
It's simply... tropical madness.

27:57.683 --> 28:01.636
'A private investigator's good reputation
is his most valued asset.

28:01.691 --> 28:05.027
'I'm very particular about the cases I take
and what I do on them.

28:05.072 --> 28:07.695
'For example, I never break the law.

28:09.914 --> 28:15.506
'However, with somebody trying to kill me,
maybe I could just bend it a little.'

29:13.030 --> 29:16.200
'Here I was, once again,
illegally searching a room.

29:16.244 --> 29:19.367
'It was the kind of thing
I never got comfortable with.

29:19.417 --> 29:22.539
'I tried to console myself
that it was for a good cause.

29:22.589 --> 29:27.588
'And I only hoped that I wouldn't have to try
and explain it to the police.'

30:09.008 --> 30:13.639
All the evidence makes it look
like you're the target. I'm just protecting you.

30:13.683 --> 30:17.934
From what? The most beautifully
sensitive girl a man could hope to meet?

30:17.983 --> 30:21.854
Are you gonna ignore the fact that
when I... What are you doing?

30:27.876 --> 30:32.589
Oh, Jonathan, you were so right.
It's absolutely exhilarating.

30:32.635 --> 30:36.968
- I've been teaching Jennifer to swim.
- The unspoiled young lady from England

30:37.018 --> 30:41.066
finds a tropical paradise with an older,
distinguished gentleman.

30:41.109 --> 30:45.110
- What does he mean?
- I've seen your file on Higgins.

30:46.202 --> 30:51.580
You broke into my house and went through
my private papers? And you encouraged it.

30:51.628 --> 30:54.382
Higgins didn't know anything about it.

30:54.425 --> 30:58.640
Did you also play the cassettes I've dictated
or read a chapter I've typed?

30:58.683 --> 31:01.057
How much of my privacy
have you trampled on?

31:01.104 --> 31:03.182
Sample chapter?

31:05.863 --> 31:11.027
I'm so ashamed of the way I've deceived you
but it seemed like the only way.

31:11.874 --> 31:17.038
That's terrific. She's so professional,
she's already rehearsed an explanation.

31:17.676 --> 31:19.469
Magnum, please.

31:19.513 --> 31:22.967
My uncle was a member
of the British Historical Society.

31:23.019 --> 31:25.809
I took care of him when he was dying.

31:25.858 --> 31:29.859
He was working on a chronicle of
Montgomery's campaign in Africa,

31:29.907 --> 31:33.409
in particular the Prince of Wales' Fusiliers.

31:33.455 --> 31:37.290
- Don't continue.
- You aren't buying this ridiculous...

31:37.337 --> 31:39.795
What is ridiculous about the regiment?

31:39.842 --> 31:46.016
Nothing. What's ridiculous is me trying
to slip in some reality into this discussion.

31:46.062 --> 31:51.939
It was my uncle's dream to finish the book
before he died. He was my only family.

31:53.408 --> 31:58.324
And suddenly, after he was gone,
his dream became mine.

31:59.628 --> 32:02.548
After I read your records at the War Office,

32:02.592 --> 32:06.344
I was positive you were
too self-effacing to ever cooperate,

32:06.391 --> 32:09.311
so I resorted to subterfuge.

32:10.398 --> 32:13.520
Then I met you, got to know you,

32:14.948 --> 32:17.026
and became fond of you.

32:24.549 --> 32:26.959
You don't have to say any more.

32:27.012 --> 32:29.339
Come on. Let me call the police.

32:29.391 --> 32:32.561
I'll phone Scotland Yard.
They'll run a routine check.

32:33.106 --> 32:35.516
Come on, just say something. Please.

32:36.279 --> 32:39.781
You will do us the kindness
of going to the devil.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.987
Come, my dear.

32:47.299 --> 32:51.383
'I know what you're thinking.
I was in deep trouble and sinking fast.

32:51.432 --> 32:55.302
'Higgins didn't believe me about Jennifer
or the yo-yos trying to do me in.

32:55.356 --> 32:58.027
'I was like the kid who cried "wolf'
once too often.

32:58.069 --> 33:00.360
'Somebody was manipulating me

33:00.407 --> 33:05.072
'so that I spent my energy getting Higgins
to listen to me instead of solving the case.

33:05.124 --> 33:09.255
'That meant only one thing. It was time
for desperate, inventive measures.

33:09.298 --> 33:14.130
'The only problem was I wasn't focused
on what those measures should be.'

33:14.182 --> 33:16.093
Pulll

33:16.645 --> 33:18.935
Pulll

33:28.834 --> 33:30.294
Pulll

33:33.217 --> 33:35.092
Pulll

33:38.351 --> 33:40.891
That's really not very good.

33:40.939 --> 33:45.486
You're gonna have to do a lot of practising
if you plan on using that on Higgins.

33:46.324 --> 33:49.328
Don't you ever tire of being
so incessantly rude?

33:49.372 --> 33:55.498
Absolutely. So why don't we just end this
for both of us? Satisfy our curiosity.

33:56.510 --> 33:59.466
You won't be apprehensive if I just reload?

33:59.515 --> 34:03.896
No. Not at all.
I'm an American, remember?

34:03.940 --> 34:06.897
We're supposed to catch bullets
in our teeth.

34:06.946 --> 34:11.695
Just give me the truth. Higgins doesn't
believe anything I say, thanks to your friend.

34:11.746 --> 34:14.239
- My friend?
- The one who called me.

34:14.292 --> 34:17.248
Promised to tell me
everything about you if I met him.

34:17.297 --> 34:19.505
A lie. Worse, an obvious lie.

34:19.552 --> 34:23.219
What if I call the Historical Society
with your dead uncle's name?

34:23.266 --> 34:25.938
- I bet they never heard of him.
- Another lie.

34:25.981 --> 34:30.029
Like your identity?
Like your love affair with Higgins?

34:30.071 --> 34:33.194
You're a liar. You're a damnable liarl

34:39.380 --> 34:41.623
Magnum !

34:41.676 --> 34:43.967
Your conduct is abominablel

34:44.014 --> 34:46.589
I should use this on you. I should...

34:47.645 --> 34:49.723
The hell with what I should do.

34:55.827 --> 35:00.410
It wasn't necessary, Higgins.
The kiss wasn't worth it.

35:06.096 --> 35:10.394
My God, I lost my temper.
I haven't done that in 20 years.

35:11.397 --> 35:15.399
And resorting to physical violence,
like some tawdry melodrama.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.949
I think you're actually quite wonderful.

35:18.995 --> 35:23.661
The nearest, dearest thing I've seen
to a hero in a very long time.

35:23.712 --> 35:25.671
Really.

35:27.385 --> 35:32.217
But could you please put your arm
around me, because I just might cry.

35:36.151 --> 35:38.479
How can I make amends for that barbarian?

35:38.531 --> 35:41.618
Please. I don't even want to think about him.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.620
But...

35:43.665 --> 35:46.158
But what?

35:47.547 --> 35:51.679
I want to be with you.
In your home with your personal things.

35:51.722 --> 35:57.017
But how can I, knowing that he's down there
in the guesthouse, leering at us?

35:57.065 --> 36:01.731
We could go away for a while.
Any place you like.

36:01.782 --> 36:06.115
And give him the satisfaction
of knowing he's intimidated us? Never.

36:06.165 --> 36:09.501
There's got to be some other way.

36:25.531 --> 36:29.068
Higgins, I'm packing as fast as I can.

36:29.121 --> 36:33.371
Unless you plan on carrying my bags,
your standing there won't help me.

36:33.420 --> 36:38.252
You promised to be out by noon. I thought it
prudent to check your progress.

36:38.304 --> 36:41.058
I'll be at TC's if my clients want to reach me.

36:41.101 --> 36:46.526
A remote prospect but nonetheless
I'll be delighted to relay the information.

36:57.840 --> 37:02.221
My darling, you look ravishing.
A little champagne?

37:11.407 --> 37:13.697
My darling, you look ravishing.

37:15.790 --> 37:17.867
A little champagne?

37:27.311 --> 37:30.148
My darling, you look ravishing.

37:30.191 --> 37:33.479
A little champagne?

37:36.536 --> 37:39.659
'I knew I was taking a terrible gamble
sneaking back.

37:39.709 --> 37:45.134
'If I was right, Jennifer and her cohort would
make their move and I'd stop them.

37:45.177 --> 37:48.929
'If I was wrong, well, I'd be losing a lot.

37:48.976 --> 37:51.599
'Higgins was a stubborn, tyrannical snob

37:51.647 --> 37:55.600
'but for some crazy reason,
I knew I'd miss him.'

38:42.366 --> 38:44.609
My darling, you look ravishing.

38:45.371 --> 38:47.449
A little champagne?

38:50.339 --> 38:54.042
Charles Boyer, the torch is passed.

38:59.689 --> 39:02.811
Zeus, Apollo. On guard, lads.

39:12.087 --> 39:14.378
What the bloody blazes?

39:16.846 --> 39:19.006
My darling...

39:19.058 --> 39:21.099
you look ravishing.

39:21.145 --> 39:22.771
A little...

39:22.815 --> 39:27.231
Now, stay. Miss Chapman's let herself in
with her own gate key.

39:39.637 --> 39:41.216
Oh, my Godl

39:41.265 --> 39:46.775
Hey, Higgie baby.
Now, that is bad. That is super bad.

39:46.817 --> 39:49.856
- Got a big night planned?
- How did you get in here?

39:49.906 --> 39:52.234
Rang the bell.

39:52.286 --> 39:56.833
I must've rang it too hard. Sparks started
to fly out when I leaned on the gate.

39:56.878 --> 40:00.083
What did you lean on it with?
You short-circuited the alarm.

40:00.134 --> 40:03.921
- No jive?
- Leave now. You are no longer a guest.

40:03.974 --> 40:07.346
You are a common trespasser
who will be dealt with summarily.

40:07.397 --> 40:09.641
I'm going. But it just so happens

40:09.693 --> 40:15.736
that Thomas Magnum borrowed
certain personal belongings of mine.

40:15.787 --> 40:18.459
He was so busy when he hightailed it...

40:18.501 --> 40:23.879
Any items of yours inadvertently left on the
premises will be returned to you forthwith.

40:23.927 --> 40:29.472
Hey. Well, just in case, I made up a list,
which I have here, somewhere.

40:29.521 --> 40:30.601
Oh.

40:30.648 --> 40:36.489
Now, first up, my coffee pot,
which is absolutely almost brand-new.

40:36.534 --> 40:40.202
My clock radio. I don't know why
Thomas Magnum borrowed that.

40:40.249 --> 40:42.825
He never got up early since the Navy.

40:42.879 --> 40:46.465
I can read the list.
It'll be delivered to you in the morning.

40:46.510 --> 40:51.806
I know my stuff, so don't try to palm off
any of that junk you have laying around.

40:54.901 --> 40:56.016
Wow.

40:56.070 --> 41:00.617
My dearl You look ravishingl
Ha-hal A little champagne?

41:00.661 --> 41:05.873
Do something about your voice. Sounds like
you're coming down with something.

41:05.921 --> 41:07.999
Have a good evening.

41:26.626 --> 41:28.620
- You got him?
- Loud and clear.

41:28.671 --> 41:31.211
I'll bet it's boring.

41:34.014 --> 41:36.768
Jonathan, may I ask a favour?

41:38.022 --> 41:42.070
- Anything.
- I thought this was to be a private evening.

41:42.113 --> 41:44.986
Must they watch?

41:45.035 --> 41:46.910
Oh.

41:47.873 --> 41:50.793
Zeus, Apollo. Kitchen.

42:07.534 --> 42:09.862
The gate's open. We got company.

42:20.475 --> 42:23.811
I don't mean to engage
in sentimental gush, my dear,

42:25.234 --> 42:30.659
but these last few days since I've met you
have been simply extraordinary.

42:30.702 --> 42:33.326
It's been a magic time for me, too.

42:38.759 --> 42:42.095
Excuse me. This will only take a moment.

42:44.603 --> 42:47.143
TC, I distinctly told you...

42:49.821 --> 42:51.981
A sumo wrestler and a dwarf?

42:52.033 --> 42:56.699
Ah, my dear Higgins. Good evening.
So frightfully sorry to intrude.

42:56.750 --> 42:59.504
I know who is playing this practical joke

42:59.547 --> 43:02.550
and you may tell Mr Magnum
we are not amused.

43:02.594 --> 43:04.422
Jennifer, the alarml

43:06.017 --> 43:08.689
Jennifer, behind the desk, the alarml

43:09.816 --> 43:12.487
- Jennifer, what is this?
- Don't worry.

43:12.529 --> 43:17.409
- It isn't physical violence we're here for.
- What?

43:17.997 --> 43:20.241
The humiliation.

43:20.293 --> 43:21.955
Why?

43:22.005 --> 43:26.837
Because of what you did during the war
in Egypt to my mother and him.

43:26.889 --> 43:30.640
You betrayed them when they tried to elope.
Tell himl

43:30.687 --> 43:34.309
Elopement? Egypt?
I'm afraid I haven't the foggiest.

43:34.361 --> 43:38.611
Unfortunately, inexcusably,
I'm afraid he's right.

43:38.660 --> 43:40.702
What?

43:40.748 --> 43:45.627
Yes, it was an extremely elaborate idea,
over a year in the planning.

43:45.673 --> 43:50.505
You, my dear,
were merely the final actor in our drama.

43:50.557 --> 43:57.360
I'm terribly sorry to have deceived you
but the air of innocent conviction

43:57.403 --> 44:01.654
which you brought to our endeavour
was absolutely essential.

44:01.703 --> 44:06.583
Since this may be my last opportunity to
speak, may I inquire quickly what you want?

44:06.628 --> 44:09.585
Really, need you ask?

44:09.634 --> 44:13.088
Robin Masters,
the struggling young writer in Paris.

44:13.140 --> 44:17.094
Spending his pittance on what
he considered to be works of great art.

44:17.148 --> 44:23.488
And how right he was. What insight.
What audacity. Picasso, Miro, Matisse.

44:23.535 --> 44:27.072
Surely one of the world's greatest
private collections.

44:27.124 --> 44:30.294
Worth conservatively, what... 30 million?

44:30.339 --> 44:33.295
37 is a more accurate...

44:33.344 --> 44:38.010
And so thoughtful of you
to hand it to us on a silver platter.

44:38.061 --> 44:40.519
A most appreciated gesture.

44:42.361 --> 44:46.611
Mind you, I must say, I don't relish being
in your shoes in a couple of days' time

44:46.660 --> 44:50.198
when they find out
what an ineffectual custodian you were.

44:52.588 --> 44:55.675
Carefull

45:03.233 --> 45:06.106
Hold it right there. Higgins, you all right?

45:06.155 --> 45:09.990
One move and this goes right through it.

45:10.037 --> 45:15.118
Unless you're a far better shot than I think
you are, I suggest we negotiate.

45:15.171 --> 45:17.498
Let's not.

45:20.932 --> 45:22.807
Not absolutely essential.

45:29.907 --> 45:31.782
TCI

45:31.827 --> 45:33.905
Get this guy off mel

45:36.335 --> 45:39.837
I should resign as head of security,
apologise to Robin Masters,

45:39.883 --> 45:41.676
leave the islands.

45:41.720 --> 45:44.509
Would you postpone that self-pity
for ten minutes?

45:44.558 --> 45:48.429
There's somebody else
you should consider. Jennifer.

45:48.482 --> 45:52.614
- Please. No additional salt in the wound.
- Come on. She's outside.

45:52.657 --> 45:56.242
The police are gonna be here soon
and she's determined to confess.

45:56.288 --> 45:59.874
- Confess?
- Take the blame. Go to jail to protect you.

45:59.920 --> 46:02.294
- She's innocent.
- Innocent?

46:02.341 --> 46:05.131
You heard what he said. She was tricked.

46:05.180 --> 46:08.634
What's more,
she really cares about you. Really.

46:09.605 --> 46:11.765
Oh? Really?

46:11.817 --> 46:15.949
Yes. You gotta move fast.
This is your chance to do the decent thing.

46:15.991 --> 46:20.823
The gallant, honourable gesture.
The gentleman's code, remember?

46:24.340 --> 46:26.418
Save her.

46:49.636 --> 46:51.845
Jennifer.

46:51.891 --> 46:53.849
Jonathan.

46:53.894 --> 46:56.814
I'm so ashamed
I can't even beg your pardon.

46:56.858 --> 47:01.025
But I can forgive you. Easily.
A thousand times.

47:01.074 --> 47:06.155
But now, you must go.
TC will fly you out before the police arrive.

47:06.209 --> 47:10.590
But I can't leave you here to take the blame
alone. I've got to stay with you.

47:10.633 --> 47:14.337
No. Your place is away from here.
In freedom.

47:14.390 --> 47:19.222
If you stay, maybe not tomorrow,
maybe not next year,

47:19.274 --> 47:22.729
but one day, you'd only break my heart.

47:22.781 --> 47:28.325
If you go, you have your whole life ahead
and I'll have this time to treasure.

47:30.295 --> 47:32.419
But I care for you.

47:33.384 --> 47:36.007
And I love you.

47:37.099 --> 47:39.426
So you see, for me...

47:48.954 --> 47:53.501
For me, my darling, you must go.

48:15.252 --> 48:18.422
You know, Higgins, that was a bit of all right.

48:18.466 --> 48:21.589
Don't hand me
that wretched understatement.

48:21.639 --> 48:23.930
I was bloody marvellous.
