<i>Previously on</i> East New York... You got to think of yourself

00:03.786 --> 00:06.484

You need something,

00:06.484 --> 00:07.920
have that thing.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.487
Where'd you learn
to speak, uh, Italian?

00:09.487 --> 00:11.098
I lived in Italy when I was 16.

00:11.098 --> 00:14.014
Had an Italian boyfriend
and everything. Long story.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.712
- He's a kid from East New York.
- And you're a kid
from Westchester.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.670
I also want members
of the service

00:18.670 --> 00:20.411

00:20.411 --> 00:22.370
The lying in this precinct
stops now.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.285
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

00:24.285 --> 00:25.764
Think you'll ever give it up
to her?

00:25.764 --> 00:27.505
She don't need me
to give it up to her.

00:27.505 --> 00:30.117
You still haven't gone
to see psych services?

00:30.117 --> 00:32.075
Your father was a cop.

00:32.075 --> 00:34.947
I know he left the job
under difficult circumstances.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.732
Excuse me, I am here

00:36.732 --> 00:39.039

- Yeah.

00:54.184 --> 00:56.056
Yeah, we got a call you were
requesting police assistance.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.535
How can I help you?

00:57.535 --> 00:59.233
Oh, yeah, so the owner,
he always rides us

00:59.233 --> 01:00.973
about checking the notes section

01:00.973 --> 01:03.019
on the meal delivery apps.
When I seen this, Mm-hmm.

01:03.019 --> 01:04.325
I didn't know what to do.

01:04.325 --> 01:05.195
The boss told me
to hit you up right away.

01:05.195 --> 01:06.675
Uh, "notes section"?

01:06.675 --> 01:08.198
Yeah, you know, like,
uh, off-menu requests.

01:08.198 --> 01:10.026
Extra ketchup,
sauce on the side.

01:10.026 --> 01:12.420
This wasn't that.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.817
7-4 15 to Central.

01:18.817 --> 01:21.820
Requesting a patrol
supervisor to my location.

Mom!

01:43.451 --> 01:45.540
Why are you late
for your morning run?

01:45.540 --> 01:48.456
I've been waiting
half an hour.

01:48.456 --> 01:50.588
Maybe you overslept
because you met

01:50.588 --> 01:52.547
an exciting man?

01:52.547 --> 01:54.723
And had a date for a change?

01:54.723 --> 01:56.159
I mean, that would
be nice because

01:56.159 --> 01:57.726
then maybe I'd get
some grandkids.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.858
Not that I'm pushing,
but you notice I'm guessing,

01:59.858 --> 02:02.992
since there have been
no calls, no texts,

02:02.992 --> 02:04.559
no emails.
Oh!

02:04.559 --> 02:06.561
That's too much guilt
before morning coffee.

02:06.561 --> 02:08.345
So why you ghosting me?

02:08.345 --> 02:10.869
I'm not, I just,
- I've been busy.
- Oh.

02:10.869 --> 02:13.350
New job,
new responsibilities, it's...

02:13.350 --> 02:15.265
it's been a lot.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.006
Work should be
number three

02:17.006 --> 02:19.008
on your list,
Regina Gail.

02:19.008 --> 02:21.315
But I think I know...

02:21.315 --> 02:24.013
a way you can make it up to me.

02:24.013 --> 02:26.450
Do I even want to know?

02:26.450 --> 02:28.844
Second chances, Regina.

02:28.844 --> 02:31.325
No, Mom, just no.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.109
Dinner...

02:33.109 --> 02:35.894
at the house as a family.
Your dad...

02:35.894 --> 02:38.549
Has been MIA
for a while now.

02:38.549 --> 02:40.595
And it turns out,
I didn't need him.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.945
After all this time...
Why do you?

02:42.945 --> 02:44.816
God joined us.

02:44.816 --> 02:47.210
And no one better get
in His way.

02:47.210 --> 02:50.213
I guess no one
told Dad. Look.

02:50.213 --> 02:53.216
You want to forgive him,
fine, just leave me out of it.

02:53.216 --> 02:55.392
I'm happy to,
'cause our marriage is none

02:55.392 --> 02:56.698
- of your business.
- That's right.

02:56.698 --> 02:59.266
But you forgive someone
not for them...

02:59.266 --> 03:01.355
it frees you.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.009
Hate is a heavy burden.

03:04.009 --> 03:06.229
No, I don't hate him,
I just don't care.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.318
I'll see you later.

03:14.585 --> 03:16.413
All right, who's making
threats 'cause they're

03:16.413 --> 03:18.807
unhappy with their bacon,
egg and cheese on a roll?

03:18.807 --> 03:20.591
Read it.

03:20.591 --> 03:22.419
"Hostage. Send police,

03:22.419 --> 03:24.204
"quick, quiet.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.162
Please help."

03:33.517 --> 03:35.476
Okay.

03:51.318 --> 03:53.233
Come on, come on,
just do it for me, baby.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.800
Come on, come on, come on!

04:00.457 --> 04:03.330
You can always
take the day,

04:03.330 --> 04:05.201
reassess, think about

04:05.201 --> 04:07.203
if this is really what you want
to do with your life.

04:07.203 --> 04:08.857
I got to call an Uber.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.424
I'm gonna get reamed for
missing roll call, Mom.

04:10.424 --> 04:12.904
This two-hour
commute is killing me.

04:12.904 --> 04:15.733
There is a rent-free apartment
in the city close to work.

04:15.733 --> 04:18.170
I wouldn't need the car.
I was thinking... We have a deal.

04:18.170 --> 04:21.130
You live at home your
- rookie year.
- It's not working.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.392
You're still tied up in knots
about the whole thing.

04:22.392 --> 04:24.873
I have a thousand
good reasons to worry.

04:24.873 --> 04:27.223
And it doesn't stop until you
get back home. Please, Andre.

04:27.223 --> 04:28.964
Granddad was a cop.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.487
And he walked a beat
so you didn't have to.

04:30.487 --> 04:31.749
He loved his job.

04:31.749 --> 04:33.621
And my mother never slept.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.757
Closest Uber is
20 minutes out.

04:39.757 --> 04:41.803
Take your father's car.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.805
- He's at a conference.
- I'm not driving Dad's car.

04:43.805 --> 04:45.981
Well, then stay home.

04:45.981 --> 04:48.157
Or be very, very late.

04:48.157 --> 04:50.159
And you know what I prefer.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.340
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

05:06.654 --> 05:09.134
Homeowner's name
is Isaiah James.

05:09.134 --> 05:11.006
Guy's clean, no wants,
no warrants.

05:11.006 --> 05:13.748
Doesn't make a lot of sense.
We sure this isn't a joke?

05:13.748 --> 05:16.054
- Well, I'm not laughing.
- What're the odds that someone

05:16.054 --> 05:17.752
is being held against
their will and they're able

05:17.752 --> 05:19.449
to request police
through a meal app?

05:19.449 --> 05:20.929
Well, it seems
pretty real to me.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.322
Can't ESU just
kick in the door?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.540
No, our-our hands

05:23.540 --> 05:24.628
are tied without probable cause.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.630
You're good to go.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.153
We check it out first,
then call the cavalry.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.329
Get him to open the door.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.852
Record, then bounce.

05:30.852 --> 05:32.157
Okay, got it.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.420
We'll be close by.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.899
Any sign of trouble,

05:34.899 --> 05:37.032
- we're all over it.
- Mm-hmm, copy.

05:37.032 --> 05:38.947
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:38.947 --> 05:41.079

Uh, I'm actually on the job.

06:31.652 --> 06:33.784
I was in a bit of rush and I
forgot my ID and badge at home.

06:35.133 --> 06:37.048
Car's a hundred grand.

06:37.048 --> 06:39.224

I'm late for roll call.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.450
So can I get
a little bit of courtesy?

06:47.450 --> 06:49.539
Stay in your vehicle.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.805
Did I steal it?

07:08.950 --> 07:10.473
ISAIAH [over intercom]:
Leave the food.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.040
I'm sorry, sir, I can't.
I'm gonna need a signature.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.433

07:13.433 --> 07:14.869

07:14.869 --> 07:16.566

07:16.566 --> 07:18.699
No signature,
no food, no refund.

07:30.188 --> 07:32.060
- Hey. Oh, yeah.
- Where do I sign?

07:32.060 --> 07:34.105
You're just gonna sign right--
oh, my goodness!

07:34.105 --> 07:36.281
Oh, my gosh! I am so sorry!

07:36.281 --> 07:37.674
I am such a klutz!

07:37.674 --> 07:39.546
Do you have any paper towels?
I'll...

07:39.546 --> 07:41.635
I'm so s--

07:48.468 --> 07:50.295
You know what,
I'll get another

07:50.295 --> 07:51.819
- order put in. No, no, really.
- It's fine.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.385
- Just forget it.
- I'll just put a rush on it.

07:53.385 --> 07:54.865
No, it's totally fine.
I'm sorry. It was my bad.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.172
I said forget it!

08:05.876 --> 08:08.270
You still haven't called it in
when I said I was on the job.

08:08.270 --> 08:10.533
- I told you to say in the car!
- My CO's Deputy
Inspector Regina...

08:10.533 --> 08:12.970
You have hearing trouble?
Get your ass back in the car!

08:12.970 --> 08:14.929
All you got to do is call
the 7-4. Why'd you pull me over?

08:14.929 --> 08:17.148
I wasn't speeding.
Car wasn't reported stolen.

08:17.148 --> 08:18.933
So what made you
- hit your lights?
- You got no ID,

08:18.933 --> 08:20.412
no badge in
a car that isn't yours.

08:20.412 --> 08:22.371
Which you didn't know
until you pulled me over.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.852
So tell dispatch I want
a supervisor here now.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.375
Get off me!

08:26.375 --> 08:28.029
You put hands on me!

08:28.029 --> 08:29.726
I'm taking you in!

08:34.644 --> 08:36.385
I saw a gun in plain view.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.343
Isaiah James is
definitely holding

08:38.343 --> 08:41.172
- someone against their will.
- Did you see
any evidence of that?

08:42.086 --> 08:43.697
No.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.655
You saw a gun, Brandy,
but you missed something bigger.

08:45.655 --> 08:46.917
Like what?

08:46.917 --> 08:48.179
Watch.

08:48.179 --> 08:50.704
Place is pretty empty.

08:50.704 --> 08:51.748
Well, it's on the market.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.576
Gun.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.404
That's why I spilled the food
was to get a better look.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.449
Wait, keep watching.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.323
What's that?

09:01.323 --> 09:02.759
Make it bigger.

09:06.589 --> 09:09.070
That's detcord.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.073
This guy wired his house
with a bomb.

09:14.249 --> 09:16.294
Bentley bang in sick today?

09:16.294 --> 09:18.035
I was just coming
over to get you.

09:18.035 --> 09:20.516
He got jammed up
by a Highway unit.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.170
For what?

09:22.170 --> 09:23.737
Failure to comply.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.608
That sound right to you?

09:25.608 --> 09:27.392
Not even close. I think you'd

09:27.392 --> 09:29.133
better get over there
and spring him right away.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.700
That's not all I'm gonna do.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.223
Now what are the chances
it was a misunderstanding?

09:32.223 --> 09:34.269
Above your pay grade.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.792
Let's let the white
shirts handle it.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.359
Keep your head down
and don't make it worse.

09:37.359 --> 09:40.014
Wouldn't dream of it, Sarge.

09:49.153 --> 09:51.678
Officer Ruhl, Marvin Sandeford,

09:51.678 --> 09:53.593
from the 7-4.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.948
What is your beef
with Officer Andre Bentley?

10:00.948 --> 10:03.646
I catch, release is
another department.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.692
Not if you void.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.739
Now why would I do that when
his own actions jammed him up?

10:09.739 --> 10:12.263
You do that to a probie,
he's done.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.439
He failed to comply
with my orders.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.659
You... no.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.400
Power's a heady thing.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.880
Gives you swagger.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.751
Sounds to me
you get upset

10:21.751 --> 10:23.144
when certain people don't do

10:23.144 --> 10:24.449
what you say,
the moment you say it.

10:24.449 --> 10:25.842
You accusing me of something?

10:25.842 --> 10:27.409
Yes, I am.

10:27.409 --> 10:28.715
He had no ID, no badge,

10:28.715 --> 10:29.933
no proof it was his car... You clairvoyant?

10:29.933 --> 10:30.978
You couldn't know any of this

10:30.978 --> 10:32.370
before you pulled him over.

10:32.370 --> 10:33.850
The kid has a temper.
He lashed out.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.591
- So don't put this on me.
- Did he grab your gun?

10:35.591 --> 10:36.940
Did he take a swing
- at you, did he?
- No. No!

10:39.116 --> 10:41.553
Then you escalated
the situation.

10:45.906 --> 10:48.430
We're done here. Now leave.

10:48.430 --> 10:53.304
Oh...

11:09.059 --> 11:11.714
This way, Mr. Padilla.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.716
I'm Deputy Inspector
Regina Haywood.

11:13.716 --> 11:16.197
- This is Captain Stan Yenko.
- How are you?

11:16.197 --> 11:18.678
Alex Padilla.
Please sit.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.723
So how can I help?

11:20.723 --> 11:22.725
What can you tell us
about Isaiah James?

11:22.725 --> 11:24.074
He's worked for
my construction company

11:24.074 --> 11:26.120
for the last ten years
as a blaster.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.991
-"Blaster"?
- Explosive demolition.

11:27.991 --> 11:31.603
He designs blasts to control
the way a building falls.

11:31.603 --> 11:34.824
A skilled blaster can collapse a
building into its own footprint

11:34.824 --> 11:37.479
even when it's surrounded
by other buildings.

11:37.479 --> 11:40.134
Isaiah's one out of only 100
across the country.

11:40.134 --> 11:41.918
He's indispensable.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.746
And has served his country
with honor.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.835
So I don't know what...

11:45.835 --> 11:47.532
this is all about to warrant--
what has he done?

11:47.532 --> 11:50.361
Does he have access
to a lot of explosives?

11:50.361 --> 11:51.623
All of them.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.974
Uh, dynamite, TNT, RDX,

11:53.974 --> 11:56.106
C4 to name a few.

11:56.106 --> 11:58.413
Right now, he's LOA.

11:58.413 --> 11:59.719
It's a damn shame.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.198
You say he's
on leave of absence.

12:01.198 --> 12:02.852
He have issues?

12:02.852 --> 12:05.899
He's going through
a contentious divorce that's...

12:05.899 --> 12:08.640
He's a really good guy

12:08.640 --> 12:10.207
getting screwed over,
so I don't understand

12:10.207 --> 12:11.992
why you're digging
into his life.

12:11.992 --> 12:15.169
A lot of people get divorced
and don't need time off, so?

12:15.169 --> 12:18.955
The split got nasty
when Isaiah was forced to sell

12:18.955 --> 12:21.784
the house that's been
in his family for generations.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.481
I made him take the time off.

12:23.481 --> 12:25.919
Are you missing any ordnance?

12:25.919 --> 12:28.182
They're highly regulated

12:28.182 --> 12:30.097
and secured in a vault.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.274
Are you telling me
I need to check?

12:33.274 --> 12:35.711
I am. Captain?

12:38.583 --> 12:40.368
We got
an angry ex-husband

12:40.368 --> 12:42.065
who may have
kidnapped his wife.

12:42.065 --> 12:44.241
Well, according to
the restaurant app SOS,

12:44.241 --> 12:46.113
- she's still alive.
- For now.

12:46.113 --> 12:47.636
Issue a BOLO for the ex.

12:47.636 --> 12:48.942
We need to find her in case

12:48.942 --> 12:50.465
she's not being held
in the house.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.510
But why'd he wire
the home to blow?

12:52.510 --> 12:54.469
Maybe he resented the hell

12:54.469 --> 12:56.123
out of having
to sell the family home.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.342
You know, if I can't
have it, nobody can.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.518
Full-scale
- neighborhood evacuation?
- Yes.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.694
But plainclothes
and unmarked vehicles only.

13:02.694 --> 13:05.436
Anything out in the open
might spook the guy.

13:05.436 --> 13:08.178
If I have to requisition
a mobile command unit,

13:08.178 --> 13:09.789
I don't know
how we're gonna avoid the press

13:09.789 --> 13:11.312
from invading the block.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.009
And that might
set him off.

13:13.009 --> 13:14.794
Notify ESU?
Not yet.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.752
The press monitor their calls.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.493
Let's just do what we can

13:18.493 --> 13:20.103
for the victim who asked

13:20.103 --> 13:22.279
for quick and quiet.

13:22.279 --> 13:24.368
Let me handle
the press.

13:33.073 --> 13:34.639
Come on.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.250
Got you. Come on,
right this way.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.787
Lot of uniforms here, Inspector.

13:51.787 --> 13:54.659
- We have a situation, Father.
- I'm sure you do.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.270
But this community
lives in fear of you

13:56.270 --> 13:58.228
and your situations,
so I'm saying no.

13:58.228 --> 14:00.056
You have my assurance
that no one

14:00.056 --> 14:02.015
in your sanctuary
will be interfered with.

14:02.015 --> 14:03.886
What are you doing here?

14:03.886 --> 14:07.150
I heard you can be difficult
so I just thought

14:07.150 --> 14:09.674
I'd see if perhaps
I could persuade you to be

14:09.674 --> 14:11.198
more cooperative instead.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.722
You can't force your way
onto church property, Chief.

14:13.722 --> 14:15.593
Would it make any difference
if I told you it's

14:15.593 --> 14:18.422
- a life-and-death situation?
- Only if I believed you.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.207
A man may have wired
his house with explosives.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.557
Inspector, I think that's
a little bit too much

14:22.557 --> 14:24.167
information to be sharing
with the <i>padre</i> here.

14:24.167 --> 14:25.908
Well, I think we can trust

14:25.908 --> 14:27.954
he'll keep it
in confidence.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.522
Like a confession?

14:32.654 --> 14:34.482
Do what you have to do.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.049
Thank you.

14:39.182 --> 14:41.619
He's a tough nut.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.492
Don't I know it.

14:44.492 --> 14:45.972
All right, the microphone's
hidden in the folds of the bag.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.582
All he has to do
is take it inside.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.018
Okay, and then what?

14:49.018 --> 14:50.890
I mean, come on, put me to work.
I can help.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.153
Then patrol the perimeter.
Come on, you know the drill.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.024
Hey.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.721
You won't be in the bag forever.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.462
You're too much
of a go-getter for that.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.724
Okay?

15:07.254 --> 15:09.299
Hey, I'm back.

15:09.299 --> 15:10.692
Told you to forget it!

15:10.692 --> 15:12.041
Well, I ruined
your order.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.608
So I had to fix it.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.088
I don't want it.

15:15.088 --> 15:16.785
Well, I paid
for it myself.

15:16.785 --> 15:18.700
And I'll just leave it
right here and you can

15:18.700 --> 15:20.876
eat it or not.
It's up to you.

15:30.973 --> 15:33.280
Where's your head right now?

15:33.280 --> 15:35.543
If it's not in the game,
how can you watch my six?

15:35.543 --> 15:37.414
Good to know
you care.

15:37.414 --> 15:38.981
I get wrongfully
pulled over, cuffed,

15:38.981 --> 15:40.983
thrown in a cell,
but somehow...

15:40.983 --> 15:42.985
- it becomes about you.
- No.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.726
It's about you,
and what comes next.

15:44.726 --> 15:47.033
You're about to tell me
to eat it, aren't you?

15:47.033 --> 15:49.035
No doubt
you got a genuine beef,

15:49.035 --> 15:50.993
but you got to apologize. If you
don't, you get booted for cause.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.908
If he gets to do that,
I wasn't meant to be a cop.

15:52.908 --> 15:53.953
You let this bastard
punch your ticket,

15:53.953 --> 15:55.606
he'll own every part of you.

15:55.606 --> 15:56.999
Apologize and keep
- your damn job!
- Not happening.

15:56.999 --> 15:59.959
Not happening.
I'm filing a formal complaint.

16:03.788 --> 16:06.356
Cops don't rat on cops, Bentley.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.794
Just setting yourself up
for retaliation.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.188
You saying you won't back me up?

16:13.929 --> 16:16.323
Glad to know you have my six.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.804
Sandeford, Bentley.

16:19.804 --> 16:22.285
Let's get moving.
Inspector's calling

16:22.285 --> 16:25.636
for all hands so report
to the scene forthwith.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.643
<i>What's this about?</i>

16:32.643 --> 16:35.037
I get home with groceries
and I'm surrounded by cops.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.821
Whatever Isaiah did,
it is not my fault.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.040
Does he usually go off
the deep end?

16:38.040 --> 16:40.260
There've been some episodes.

16:40.260 --> 16:43.002
He went off on my lawyer several
times, the child psychologist,

16:43.002 --> 16:44.264
even the judge.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.787
What do you think
set him off this time?

16:45.787 --> 16:47.267
Divorce was settled.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.138
Only thing we fight
about now are the girls.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.358
- How old are they?
- Eight and ten.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.012
He's a girl dad
through and through.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.839
They always have
his full attention.

16:54.839 --> 16:56.450
Any sacrifice is
never too much.

16:56.450 --> 16:59.148
He's a good parent and I
wouldn't keep them from him

16:59.148 --> 17:00.758
if he'd just agree
to get some help.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.630
Was forcing therapy part
of the divorce agreement?

17:02.630 --> 17:04.936
Yes. My lawyer, Sonya Prayal,

17:04.936 --> 17:06.547
was supposed to get
a missing signature.

17:06.547 --> 17:07.939
That was two days ago.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.550
Sir, you want
to listen to this?

17:09.550 --> 17:11.552
Tell us if you
recognize a voice.

17:11.552 --> 17:13.815
You have to let me go.

17:13.815 --> 17:16.165
Please, I have a family,
I have...

17:16.165 --> 17:19.429
I had one, too.
It's your fault I lost them.

17:19.429 --> 17:21.692
That's Sonya! You need to go in
there and get her right now!

17:21.692 --> 17:24.130
The divorce, it took forever
and Sonya went the extra mile.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.871
She didn't charge me an arm
and a leg. She's good people.

17:26.871 --> 17:28.395
Any reason your ex
would hold a grudge

17:28.395 --> 17:29.918
against your lawyer
instead of you?

17:29.918 --> 17:32.790
She did say he was unhinged
in open court.

17:32.790 --> 17:33.791
Well, that would do it.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.057
Damn, what's ESU doing here?

17:44.106 --> 17:46.891
Reports say there's
a female hostage...

17:52.027 --> 17:54.464
We need to control the circus
or this will end badly.

17:58.729 --> 18:00.992
You know it's not
your call anymore, right?

18:00.992 --> 18:03.299
Chief Suarez,
Deputy Inspector Haywood.

18:03.299 --> 18:05.127
I'm Captain Keith Chen.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.824
Soon as I deploy my team,
I need a briefing.

18:06.824 --> 18:08.870
It's my scene now.

18:18.749 --> 18:21.187
"We are men, we are not beasts"
was the rallying cry.

18:21.187 --> 18:24.842
Now it took four days to get
that situation under control.

18:24.842 --> 18:28.281
But 43 hostages and prisoners
at Attica were killed

18:28.281 --> 18:30.500
by unjacketed bullets

18:30.500 --> 18:33.155
fired by state and local police.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.244
Such excessive force
was a black eye

18:35.244 --> 18:36.941
for law enforcement that day,
I can tell you.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.639
We've been here awhile.

18:38.639 --> 18:40.336
When are you gonna answer
a straight question?

18:40.336 --> 18:43.165
What kind of explosives
does Isaiah James...?

18:43.165 --> 18:45.428
You know, it took 19 hours,

18:45.428 --> 18:47.909
but John Wojtowicz
didn't use any explosives

18:47.909 --> 18:49.824
when he took those hostages

18:49.824 --> 18:52.392
during
that Dog Day bank heist and

18:52.392 --> 18:54.045
to sway public opinion,

18:54.045 --> 18:56.091
he would throw money
into the crowd.

18:56.091 --> 18:58.833
And the perps... ESU has control of the scene, so...

18:58.833 --> 19:00.182
- thanks for nothing.
- Where you going?

19:00.182 --> 19:01.401
Where you going?

19:01.401 --> 19:03.185
- Guys!
- Master of the filibuster.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.318
I don't care what everyone
else says about you, Captain.

19:05.318 --> 19:07.320
You're a friggin' genius.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.626

19:53.279 --> 19:54.758
Just learned from the ex-wife

19:54.758 --> 19:56.369
that Isaiah's holding
her lawyer, Sonya Prayal.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.892
He's had her for two days.

19:57.892 --> 19:59.241
You just talked to the ex?

19:59.241 --> 20:01.200
Where is she?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.505
Who's calling
the target?

20:02.505 --> 20:04.507
What do you want, Angela?

20:04.507 --> 20:05.813
- I know what you did, Isaiah.
- Oh, it's his wife.

20:05.813 --> 20:07.684
- Son of a bitch.
- Just let Sonya go

20:07.684 --> 20:08.946
- and everything will be okay.
- Somebody get
that phone from her!

20:08.946 --> 20:10.209
Who told you to say that?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.341
You've always been a dumb cow.

20:12.341 --> 20:13.734
- Who you calling dumb?
- Hey!

20:13.734 --> 20:15.257
I'm not the one
surrounded by cops!

20:15.257 --> 20:17.085
- Idiot!
- Gimme that!
What, are you crazy?

20:20.219 --> 20:23.265
Snipers, you do not
have a green light.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.788
I was trying to help!
Somebody had to do something.

20:24.788 --> 20:26.486
That someone sure as
hell shouldn't be you!

20:26.486 --> 20:27.487
Put her on ice.

20:27.487 --> 20:28.836
Give me my phone.

20:28.836 --> 20:30.577
No, you can't
have your phone.

20:36.931 --> 20:39.455
Give me a closer
look on that.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.414
He's laying detcord everywhere.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.677
That's not good.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.722
I'm texting him
to open the door

20:45.722 --> 20:47.637
and take the phone.

21:07.483 --> 21:08.789
You come in here,
I'll blow the house.

21:08.789 --> 21:09.659
Place is wired.

21:09.659 --> 21:10.878
I hear you.

21:10.878 --> 21:12.619
My name's Keith Chen.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.185
How's everyone doing in there?

21:14.185 --> 21:15.578
Great. Couldn't be better.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.319
And Sonya?

21:17.319 --> 21:19.843
She probably wishes she minded
her own damn business.

21:19.843 --> 21:21.062
Is she hurt?

21:21.062 --> 21:22.150
No.

21:22.150 --> 21:23.499
So no one's been hurt yet.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.109
All right, that's a good thing.

21:25.109 --> 21:26.807
There's still a chance to
resolve this peacefully.

21:26.807 --> 21:28.983
- Lie.
- We just want to make sure
everyone's safe.

21:28.983 --> 21:30.506
Another lie.

21:30.506 --> 21:32.029
I see snipers on the building.

21:32.029 --> 21:33.857
You-you don't give a damn
what happens to me.

21:33.857 --> 21:35.511
We do care, Isaiah.

21:35.511 --> 21:38.688
Okay? We care about you
and we care about Sonya.

21:38.688 --> 21:40.560
Well, you know what,
I don't believe you.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.344
So if you come in here,
we all go.

21:42.344 --> 21:43.563
That's a promise.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.352
<i>I'd like to talk to him myself.</i>

21:50.352 --> 21:51.484
<i>You're not getting through.</i>

21:51.962 --> 21:53.312
Maybe I can.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.487
<i>What makes you think that?</i>

21:54.487 --> 21:55.923
<i>De-escalation.</i>

21:55.923 --> 21:58.839
Captain, Isaiah wanted
to blow up his home.

21:58.839 --> 22:01.581
He didn't intend
to take the lawyer hostage.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.539
She showed up
to get a signature.

22:03.539 --> 22:06.020
- He wasn't expecting her.
- You don't know that.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.588
The first one on the scene
has the most information.

22:08.588 --> 22:10.285
Look, I...Let me try.

22:10.285 --> 22:12.418
I know you had negotiation
training in the past,

22:12.418 --> 22:13.506
but my answer's no.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.903
Give me another
look there.

22:38.095 --> 22:39.140
Scuse me.

22:48.018 --> 22:49.106
Officer.

22:49.106 --> 22:51.065
Father.

22:51.065 --> 22:53.328
I know every neighbor and
parishioner of this church.

22:53.328 --> 22:55.722
- You aren't one of them.
- And I know every felon
in my patrol sector.

22:55.722 --> 22:57.158
Looks like you're harboring one.

22:57.158 --> 22:59.160
Perp's wanted
for Assault 1.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.292
Thought your book believed
- in reaping and sowing.
- Why don't you try

23:01.292 --> 23:03.425
reading the whole book before
you cherry-pick scripture.

23:03.425 --> 23:06.341
Out there, you're the law.
In here, you're my guest.

23:18.092 --> 23:21.965
Bomb Squad just went through
all this, uh, video footage.

23:21.965 --> 23:24.403
They say the electronic triggers
are daisy-chained.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.752
So one goes, they all go.

23:25.752 --> 23:27.188
He won't give up
the hostage,

23:27.188 --> 23:29.103
and now he's not
even talking to us.

23:29.103 --> 23:30.539
Eventually, they're gonna
lure him to the window

23:30.539 --> 23:32.280
and snipe him before
he blows the place up.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.108
If he's not talking,
it might be the only way.

23:34.108 --> 23:35.979
Before we reach
that conclusion,

23:35.979 --> 23:38.460
I'd like a shot
at talking to him.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.201
I think I can
reach this guy.

23:40.201 --> 23:41.463
I got to say no, Regina.

23:41.463 --> 23:44.727
It's time to let ESU
do their job.

23:44.727 --> 23:47.469
Nobody gets to make a bomb
threat in this city anymore

23:47.469 --> 23:48.818
and expect to just walk away.

23:48.818 --> 23:50.472
One PP got to you.

23:50.472 --> 23:51.952
- They did.
- I got

23:51.952 --> 23:54.520
chiefs and super chiefs
blowing up my cell, yes.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.696
Next call's gonna
probably be the PC,

23:56.696 --> 23:58.959
ordering us
to light him up.

24:23.287 --> 24:24.724
One of your officers
tried to arrest

24:24.724 --> 24:26.160
one of my people
inside the nave.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.814
That's why I can't trust
you guys.

24:27.814 --> 24:30.251
Since when did the church
give sanctuary to criminals?

24:30.251 --> 24:32.035
We offer mercy.
You should try it.

24:32.035 --> 24:34.385
Well, as soon as he turns
himself in, I'll consider it.

24:34.385 --> 24:38.259
You're trying awfully hard
to fix a very small problem.

24:39.913 --> 24:43.394
We may be forced to kill
this guy to save his hostage.

24:43.394 --> 24:46.049
And since when
- do you care about that?
- Hey.

24:47.398 --> 24:49.357
I've never been quick
to kill anyone.

24:49.357 --> 24:51.141
Not even a bad guy.

24:51.141 --> 24:53.230
Most cops feel the
same way, Frank.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.755
So quit treating us
like we're the enemy.

24:56.756 --> 24:58.105
Yeah.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.079
He's not taking your calls.

25:16.079 --> 25:17.690
Thanks for the update.

25:17.690 --> 25:19.387
Let me use
the ex-wife's cell phone.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.563
No. You could set
off the explosive.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.957
We already know it didn't go off
when she called the first time.

25:23.957 --> 25:25.262
You got a better idea?

25:25.262 --> 25:26.612
I don't need one.

25:26.612 --> 25:27.743
I already told you no.

25:27.743 --> 25:30.398
Let me try
to get through to him.

25:30.398 --> 25:33.488
You have your marching orders
to take him out.

25:33.488 --> 25:34.794
What difference
could it possibly make,

25:34.794 --> 25:37.448
me wasting my time
talking the guy down?

25:43.150 --> 25:45.108
We follow a script.

25:45.108 --> 25:47.023
If he escalates, hang up.

25:47.023 --> 25:49.243
Your scene, your rules.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.777
Are you happy now, Angela?

26:01.777 --> 26:03.344
Look what you did.

26:03.344 --> 26:05.912
Isaiah, this is
Deputy Inspector Regina Haywood.

26:05.912 --> 26:08.479
I understand
you have a legitimate grievance,

26:08.479 --> 26:09.742
and we can talk about it.

26:09.742 --> 26:11.613
But not like this.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.006
What's left to say?

26:13.006 --> 26:15.095
You can start by telling
me what you want.

26:15.095 --> 26:17.271
I want...

26:17.271 --> 26:19.839
I don't even know anymore.

26:19.839 --> 26:22.711
- I'm so tired.
- This is exactly what
she's not supposed to do.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.278
The guy's finally talking.
What's your problem?

26:24.278 --> 26:25.801
Maybe that's the point.

26:25.801 --> 26:27.716
Hey, you're crazy if you
think I want headlines.

26:27.716 --> 26:29.762
"Man Blows Up Himself
and Hostage"?

26:29.762 --> 26:31.764
Then let her work.
I got to say,

26:31.764 --> 26:34.288
you got our undivided
attention. Isaiah,

26:34.288 --> 26:36.377
we're troubled
by the wired house

26:36.377 --> 26:38.640
and very concerned
about the hostage.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.816
So let's lower the temperature

26:40.816 --> 26:42.601
by sending out Sonya Prayal.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.820
And then we can just--
we can just talk.

26:44.820 --> 26:47.040
They're worried
about Sonya Prayal?

26:47.040 --> 26:48.302
What about all the things
she did to me?

26:48.302 --> 26:49.956
Well, you can tell
me all about it.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.305
I'm willing to listen.

26:51.305 --> 26:52.654
After you let her go.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.003
Only way I release her
is when I toss

26:54.003 --> 26:55.483
her dead body
on the front steps.

26:55.483 --> 26:57.398
He's es-- he's escalating.
- Hang up.
- Okay.

26:57.398 --> 26:58.660
What about
- your daughters?
- Hang up.

26:58.660 --> 26:59.922
How are they going to feel

26:59.922 --> 27:01.141
when they learn
what you've done?

27:01.141 --> 27:02.969
Do not talk to me about my kids!

27:02.969 --> 27:04.535
But they love you.

27:04.535 --> 27:06.581
How are they supposed
to handle the fallout?

27:06.581 --> 27:08.061
H-Have you considered
them at all?

27:08.061 --> 27:10.063
I don't see them or talk to them

27:10.063 --> 27:11.804
because their mother
wants to punish me.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.719
I haven't hugged them in months
while this...

27:13.719 --> 27:15.938
lawyer and my demon ex-wife

27:15.938 --> 27:18.071
raked me across the coals.
They're all I had left,

27:18.071 --> 27:20.334
and they took them from me!

27:21.074 --> 27:22.292
Damn it!

27:23.511 --> 27:25.121
Hell of a pooch screw, Inspector.

27:25.121 --> 27:26.775
Now whatever
happens next

27:26.775 --> 27:29.299
- is on you.
- His children mean
the world to him.

27:29.299 --> 27:32.389
I thought he would <i>listen,</i> Captain,

27:32.389 --> 27:35.131
if I talked about what it would
do to their well-being.

27:35.131 --> 27:36.872
Well, you were wrong.
Hey, hey.

27:36.872 --> 27:38.526
We got movement. Hey.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.621
You come in,

27:46.621 --> 27:47.753
you're dead!

27:47.753 --> 27:50.451
Shoot me, she's dead!

27:50.451 --> 27:52.453
How you like me now?!

28:16.346 --> 28:17.652
Hey, man. Give me
back my camera.

28:17.652 --> 28:19.175
Stay behind the barricade.

28:19.175 --> 28:20.742
I have the right
to report the news, Officer.

28:20.742 --> 28:23.832
Andre Bentley,
badge #66107, out of the 7-4.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.181
Anything else you want to know?

28:25.181 --> 28:26.835
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stay in your lane

28:26.835 --> 28:28.445
or get zip-tied,
because you're interfering

28:28.445 --> 28:29.795
with a police action.
Understand?

28:29.795 --> 28:31.361
Up to you.

28:31.361 --> 28:32.928
Come on.

28:32.928 --> 28:34.800
- I don't need your help.
- Yeah, well, I'm pissed

28:34.800 --> 28:36.236
'cause I'm out of the action
and I'm babysitting some press.

28:36.236 --> 28:37.324
What's your problem?

28:37.324 --> 28:39.065
Nothing I can't handle.

28:39.065 --> 28:41.676
Got to say, you
manhandle a reporter,

28:41.676 --> 28:44.548
they can frame up a story
that can seriously jam you up.

28:45.593 --> 28:46.986
What, are you
looking for trouble?

28:46.986 --> 28:49.118
Don't have to look for it
if it finds me.

28:50.380 --> 28:51.947
<i>What do you think?</i> KILLIAN: <i>Well,</i>

28:51.947 --> 28:54.428
he's got a shotgun
taped to a woman's neck.

28:54.428 --> 28:55.864
Seems committed to
seeing this through.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.083
I don't think so.

28:57.083 --> 28:58.954
This escalated
every step of the way.

28:58.954 --> 29:01.130
Now it's out of control
and he's stuck.

29:01.130 --> 29:03.437
I doubt there's
even shells in the gun.

29:03.437 --> 29:05.744
- What makes you say that?
- Sonya caught him

29:05.744 --> 29:07.310
planting explosives when she

29:07.310 --> 29:09.530
unexpectedly showed up
to get a signature.

29:09.530 --> 29:10.749
He couldn't let her leave.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.881
But he did let her
order food and...

29:12.881 --> 29:14.753
Right. And he had
her for two days.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.929
So if he wanted to kill her,
- he would've done it already.
- Right.

29:18.974 --> 29:20.933
Saw you had beef
on the line.

29:20.933 --> 29:23.022
- You all right?
- Yeah.

29:23.022 --> 29:24.501
I got to take
a leak.

29:25.894 --> 29:28.114
Rookie's still
running hot, huh?

29:29.855 --> 29:31.813
You think I don't get
a heads-up when one

29:31.813 --> 29:33.380
of my officers is in custody?

29:34.381 --> 29:35.512
Thinks I'm hanging him out
to dry.

29:35.512 --> 29:36.731
Now, let meguess--

29:36.731 --> 29:38.211
you told him to apologize.

29:38.211 --> 29:39.778
Making waves
just rocks the boat.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.170
Yeah. Sometimes.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.824
When we first got on the job,

29:42.824 --> 29:44.913
we had to eat every
insult, offense...

29:44.913 --> 29:47.176
...slur
that they hurled our way.

29:47.176 --> 29:48.438
You and me, we were supposed

29:48.438 --> 29:49.744
to put it all to bed.

29:49.744 --> 29:52.703
But, uh, sometimes
I feel like...

29:52.703 --> 29:54.880
we haven't made
any progress at all.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.188
I don't know
if I'd say that, Chief.

29:59.188 --> 30:01.060
A lot of us watched you rise.

30:02.104 --> 30:04.803
Those stars on your collar say
there's been plenty of progress.

30:06.021 --> 30:08.197
I don't live
in my uniform though. Do you?

30:09.764 --> 30:10.896
You'll feel better

30:10.896 --> 30:12.680
if you... do something real.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.247
Yeah, but...
I'd get arraigned

30:14.247 --> 30:15.988
if I did what I wanted to do.

30:15.988 --> 30:17.293
Any suggestions?

30:19.600 --> 30:21.210
Show the rookie
you got his back.

30:22.211 --> 30:23.822
No matter what.

30:24.823 --> 30:25.867
Chief Suarez.

30:27.260 --> 30:29.392
Uh, yeah. I'm on my way.

30:34.223 --> 30:35.442
Do you have joy?

30:35.442 --> 30:36.835
Negative. No clean shots.

30:38.358 --> 30:39.402
Haywood.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.103
If you can get him
to talk to you,

30:44.103 --> 30:45.408
keep him in that window.

30:45.408 --> 30:46.496
Snipers can't take the shot

30:46.496 --> 30:47.846
without hitting the hostage.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.412
They can if they hit
the sweet spot.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.023
Shot to
the dime-sized medulla

30:51.023 --> 30:53.155
will kill a body twitch
before he hits the floor.

30:54.765 --> 30:55.897
What if they miss?

30:55.897 --> 30:58.421
That's a risk
we have to take.

31:03.513 --> 31:04.601
You really think

31:04.601 --> 31:05.864
this is a good idea, Captain?

31:05.864 --> 31:07.778
Time for negotiation's
over, Chief.

31:07.778 --> 31:09.868
She's holding my target steady.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.739
Take the shot on my signal.
Snipers, be ready.

31:11.739 --> 31:12.827
Roger that.

31:25.144 --> 31:27.146
What's your next step, Isaiah?

31:27.146 --> 31:28.495
I want to see my daughters.

31:28.495 --> 31:29.844
I need to see them.

31:29.844 --> 31:32.368
You can. At my precinct,
after processing.

31:32.368 --> 31:33.456
No!

31:33.456 --> 31:34.631
Bring them here.

31:34.631 --> 31:36.242
I wouldn't do that to them.

31:36.242 --> 31:38.070
I care too much
about their welfare.

31:38.070 --> 31:39.506
You're not in charge.

31:39.506 --> 31:40.637
I'm in charge.

31:40.637 --> 31:41.725
You asked me what I wanted.

31:41.725 --> 31:44.206
That's what I want-- my kids!

31:49.429 --> 31:51.083
Take the shot when you have it.

31:52.388 --> 31:53.912
Do me a favor.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.565
We can talk,

31:55.565 --> 31:57.045
but step away
from the window first.

31:57.045 --> 31:58.438
They're not gonna shoot me.

31:58.438 --> 32:00.179
They're willing
to end this.

32:00.179 --> 32:01.745
I'm the only one that's not.

32:01.745 --> 32:03.051
Move.

32:03.051 --> 32:05.401
- Right now.
- Please let me go.

32:05.401 --> 32:06.359
I'm begging you.

32:07.621 --> 32:08.839
Isaiah?

32:08.839 --> 32:10.145
I've lost the shot.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.148
Is Sonya okay?

32:13.148 --> 32:14.193
She's fine.

32:14.193 --> 32:15.411
She's whining.

32:15.411 --> 32:17.239
So why don't you let her go?

32:17.239 --> 32:19.241
Eventually, this'll all end.

32:19.241 --> 32:20.982
Don't do anything stupid. Isaiah,

32:20.982 --> 32:22.462
she's someone's daughter, too.

32:22.462 --> 32:24.551
Can I just talk to my kids
on the phone?

32:24.551 --> 32:26.118
Wouldn't you rather hug them?

32:26.118 --> 32:29.121
Look, I don't know
when the world decided

32:29.121 --> 32:30.992
that men were expendable.

32:30.992 --> 32:33.299
Kids need their fathers,
especially girls.

32:33.299 --> 32:34.953
Fathers...

32:34.953 --> 32:37.694
are the first relationship
with a man they have.

32:37.694 --> 32:40.741
If that goes wrong, they all do.

32:40.741 --> 32:43.004
My wife never understood that.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.745
I don't know
about all that.

32:44.745 --> 32:47.052
She says they're
daddy's girls.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.184
Look, I was one, too.

32:50.142 --> 32:54.102
And then my dad left, and...

32:54.102 --> 32:58.802
all I could do was wonder what
I did wrong to make him go away.

32:58.802 --> 33:01.414
Maybe it wasn't
your fault.

33:01.414 --> 33:04.634
Little girls can only hear that
from their fathers.

33:04.634 --> 33:05.984
Did he ever come back?

33:05.984 --> 33:07.463
Yes.

33:07.463 --> 33:08.551
What happened?

33:08.551 --> 33:10.031
I'm not little anymore.

33:10.031 --> 33:11.337
Isaiah,

33:11.337 --> 33:12.686
what are you gonna tell
your kids?

33:12.686 --> 33:14.993
I don't plan
on telling 'em anything.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.777
They won't understand.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.387
And I can't live
with what they'll think of me

33:18.387 --> 33:20.041
when they find out
what I've done.

33:20.041 --> 33:23.784
The only thing
your girls want is you.

33:24.741 --> 33:26.613
Even when you...

33:26.613 --> 33:28.963
break promises or screw up.

33:28.963 --> 33:31.052
So if all it takes
is an apology,

33:31.052 --> 33:32.358
why aren't you talking to yours?

33:32.358 --> 33:34.229
He hasn't apologized.

33:34.229 --> 33:37.058
Isaiah, it's time to end this.

33:37.058 --> 33:41.193
Don't traumatize your girls
with your mistakes.

33:41.193 --> 33:43.934
Give them a chance
to forgive you.

33:44.935 --> 33:46.720
You owe them that.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.635
You owe them.

34:00.473 --> 34:01.735
I'm coming out.

34:03.650 --> 34:05.086
He's coming out!

34:13.573 --> 34:14.791
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

34:14.791 --> 34:16.184
Don't shoot.

34:29.806 --> 34:31.112
It's empty.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.853
It's a hell of a thing, Inspector.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.637
I've never seen a white shirt
put themselves out like that.

34:34.637 --> 34:35.812
Ever.

34:36.770 --> 34:38.554
Compliments?

34:38.554 --> 34:39.903
- Huh?
- You feeling okay?

34:39.903 --> 34:41.209
Get out of here.

34:41.209 --> 34:42.819
You need an ambulance?

34:42.819 --> 34:46.171
I appreciate you giving me
the chance to talk him down.

34:46.171 --> 34:48.260
- I do.
- Is that what I did?

34:48.260 --> 34:49.957
You don't fool me, Captain.

34:49.957 --> 34:52.351
I know that you wanted
everyone to come out alive

34:52.351 --> 34:53.656
as much as I did.

34:55.093 --> 34:57.182
- Great work.
- All right.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.373
Where are we going?

35:14.373 --> 35:16.375
We're way out
of our patrol area.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.603
As long as we ride together,

35:27.603 --> 35:28.822
I got your back.

35:30.171 --> 35:31.955
Don't ever question
my loyalty again.

35:38.527 --> 35:40.225
Black grapevine's buzzing, Sandman.

35:40.225 --> 35:41.748
Heard you were
about to throw down.

35:41.748 --> 35:44.359
Don't believe
- everything you hear.
- Mm-hmm.

35:44.359 --> 35:46.448
Cop in his unit told us
where he'd be with the wife,

35:46.448 --> 35:48.494
so we tied him up
in a nice little bow.

35:48.494 --> 35:50.191
Hop to it, rook.
We don't have all day.

35:50.191 --> 35:51.540
We think

35:51.540 --> 35:52.846
he's been drinking.

36:03.030 --> 36:04.205
I had one beer.

36:04.205 --> 36:05.424
What the hell
is going on?

36:05.424 --> 36:06.686
My husband's
a police officer.

36:06.686 --> 36:08.427
Have some
damn courtesy.

36:11.691 --> 36:14.433
Sir, please step
out of the vehicle

36:14.433 --> 36:15.956
and blow in
this tube for me.

36:20.830 --> 36:22.702
Make sure you blow
extra hard.

36:25.661 --> 36:26.706
You're eating.

36:27.924 --> 36:29.187
I thought I was bringing dinner.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.362
I brought dinner.

36:30.362 --> 36:33.060
Did I not say I
was bringing it?

36:33.060 --> 36:34.192
Yeah, but I knew
you were gonna be late.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.367
And why's that?

36:35.367 --> 36:37.238
You had to convince
that parishioner

36:37.238 --> 36:39.632
to turn himself in,
Pope Francisco.

36:39.632 --> 36:41.721
That had to take some time.

36:41.721 --> 36:43.549
Jackass.

36:43.549 --> 36:44.985
What kind of priest
uses language like that?

36:44.985 --> 36:46.856
<i>Oye,</i> if it's in the
Bible, I can use it.

36:46.856 --> 36:48.684
Okay? <i>Ven acá. Dame un beso.</i>

36:49.772 --> 36:51.687
Jackass <i>y</i> jackass.

36:51.687 --> 36:53.123
Mwah. <i>Sí.</i> Ah!

36:53.123 --> 36:54.516
Make a plate

36:54.516 --> 36:56.997
for your brother
and show respect

36:56.997 --> 36:58.607
for his sacrifice.

36:58.607 --> 37:01.436
You show respect
for his sacrifice.

37:01.436 --> 37:02.742
What do I always say?

37:02.742 --> 37:04.222
- Family first.
- Family last.

37:12.621 --> 37:14.232
Ah.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.234
Oh. Just the person
I wanted to see.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.889
- Huh?
- Can I give you
a ride home? I, uh...

37:19.889 --> 37:22.283
I still have
my father's car. Nice.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.372
Um, are you sure you want
to go that far out of your way?

37:24.372 --> 37:26.287
Yeah, I need
to see your apartment.

37:28.768 --> 37:31.379
Please tell me that lame-ass
line has never worked before,

37:31.379 --> 37:33.120
because you've got
no game whatsoever.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.991
Pump the brakes, Brandy.

37:34.991 --> 37:36.732
I'm taking the other unit
in Ruskin Gardens,

37:36.732 --> 37:38.168
and I want a look
at your layout.

37:38.168 --> 37:40.606
- Oh.
- Yeah.

37:40.606 --> 37:42.303
So, want a ride?

37:42.303 --> 37:43.957
Uh, yeah.

37:43.957 --> 37:45.698
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah? Great.

37:45.698 --> 37:48.440
I'll get the door.
There you are.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.833
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

Congratulations

38:26.521 --> 38:28.480
I'm not going
to talk shop with you.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.438
Unless you're ready
to tell me what went down

38:30.438 --> 38:32.048
when you were at the 7-4.

38:32.048 --> 38:34.399
Didn't you check?

38:34.399 --> 38:37.053
Your records are restricted,
but you know that.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.056
One day, I'll spill.

I honestly don't know
where to start.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.239
"Forgive me" isn't good enough.

38:49.239 --> 38:53.156
"I'm sorry I left"
won't cut it.

38:54.201 --> 38:58.248
I want so badly
to make it right,

38:58.248 --> 39:00.903
and I know I'm...

39:00.903 --> 39:03.384
just another...

39:03.384 --> 39:05.908
screwup, okay?

39:08.215 --> 39:10.173
You can't just fix this

39:10.173 --> 39:12.175
with one swing.

39:12.175 --> 39:14.221
I spent most of yesterday
dealing with a guy

39:14.221 --> 39:17.050
who lost everything in a divorce
and was so desperate,

39:17.050 --> 39:19.487
he threatened
to blow up his own home.

39:19.487 --> 39:22.142
I talked him down
by reminding him

39:22.142 --> 39:24.144
that his daughters needed him,

39:24.144 --> 39:26.973
whether he went upstate or not.

39:26.973 --> 39:30.716
Are you saying you're willing
to admit you need me, Regina?

39:30.716 --> 39:32.326
I don't know.

39:32.326 --> 39:34.459
I thought I didn't. I...

39:34.459 --> 39:36.635
Then you thought wrong.

39:36.635 --> 39:38.898
Deny your family,

39:38.898 --> 39:40.900
you don't deserve them.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.902
You could be
talking about me.

39:42.902 --> 39:45.339
I know that, but I'm talking
to the apple that fell

39:45.339 --> 39:47.994
from your tree. Stubborn,

39:47.994 --> 39:49.909
opinionated, unforgiving...

39:49.909 --> 39:51.476
I don't know
about all that, Mom,

39:51.476 --> 39:52.955
seeing as I just forgave you
for ambushing me.

39:52.955 --> 39:56.219
Got anything left for me?

39:56.219 --> 39:58.265
I know you want a second chance,

39:58.265 --> 40:00.572
but I don't know
if I can give you one.

40:03.618 --> 40:06.491
So, I will just keep asking

40:06.491 --> 40:08.841
until you change your mind.

40:12.540 --> 40:15.761
Sausages, biscuits,

40:15.761 --> 40:19.852
gravy, eggs, potatoes.

40:19.852 --> 40:21.854
How does that sound?

40:21.854 --> 40:23.986
You cooking or something?

40:23.986 --> 40:26.119
Of course.

40:26.119 --> 40:28.817
That sounds good to me.

40:32.212 --> 40:33.735
Okay, I could eat.

40:33.735 --> 40:36.259
Okay, come on and eat.
