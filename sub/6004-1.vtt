00:21.874 --> 00:23.450
Knock it off, Quill.

00:23.475 --> 00:26.918
If the altitude don't make me hurl,
your lousy dance moves will.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.863
I am Groot.

00:28.888 --> 00:31.304
See? Even
Groot thinks you stink.

00:33.654 --> 00:37.045
Agreed, Rocket. His odor
is extremely unpleasant.

00:37.070 --> 00:39.525
Hey, I just took a shower
this morning, Drax.

00:40.492 --> 00:44.222
- ♪ All the good love, when we're all alone ♪
- Why?

00:44.257 --> 00:46.881
Showers are only for those
who actually break a sweat.

00:46.906 --> 00:49.299
Yeah, I'm more about
the overall vision, Gamora.

00:49.329 --> 00:53.895
Speaking of which, our entry point
should be right around... Here.

00:55.924 --> 00:59.376
- ♪ I'm high on believin' ♪
- I am Groot.

01:00.673 --> 01:02.411
Or maybe a little lower.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.755
So, I'm totally sold on Guardians
of the Galaxy as our name.

01:11.384 --> 01:12.898
Now we need a battle cry.

01:13.186 --> 01:15.187
Suggestions?
- I am Groot.

01:15.221 --> 01:16.905
Walked right into that one.

01:18.091 --> 01:18.801
Groot.

01:19.125 --> 01:19.941
Lights out.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.268 --> 01:31.137
Yorligian Guards,
heavily armed.

01:31.162 --> 01:33.245
Somebody doesn't want
the neighbors popping by.

01:33.439 --> 01:37.014
Okay, listen up. On my signal, we fan
out for our pre-assigned targets.

01:37.429 --> 01:40.352
Five, four,
three, two...

01:40.734 --> 01:41.387
Huh?

01:48.682 --> 01:50.014
Way ahead of you, Quill.

01:50.123 --> 01:52.876
Oh, really? So, you
have that security key I need?

01:52.901 --> 01:55.489
Clearing a path for
Groot right now.

02:05.355 --> 02:06.864
I am Groot.

02:06.889 --> 02:08.309
Yes, you are.

02:15.381 --> 02:18.049
Seriously? The password
is "password"?

02:18.084 --> 02:20.318
Oh, this place has
the worst security ever.

02:22.314 --> 02:23.072
Oh.

02:24.627 --> 02:29.635
It's cool. I got a work order
for routine repair stuff.

02:31.579 --> 02:34.074
Okay, that's
a really old photo.

02:40.139 --> 02:41.537
I am Groot!

02:45.178 --> 02:46.798
Cellblock entry
is clear.

02:47.764 --> 02:50.783
Target located.
Disabling alarms now.

02:52.235 --> 02:54.474
Aw, man! I hate that sound!

02:55.769 --> 02:57.613
That one's even worse!

03:10.436 --> 03:11.539
Take cover!

03:13.372 --> 03:15.842
Oh, yeah... No!

03:16.575 --> 03:19.426
This calls for
something... Special?

03:19.989 --> 03:22.914
Looking for this?
- Uh, Quill, you might not want to...

03:22.939 --> 03:24.639
Appendages where
I can see them!

03:25.065 --> 03:27.285
Let us go,
or we all get vaped.

03:27.322 --> 03:29.123
You're bluffing.

03:29.321 --> 03:32.190
Am I bluffing?
- You d'ast well better be!

03:32.358 --> 03:35.036
You know how much boom
I packed in that crater-maker?

03:35.494 --> 03:38.496
Hey! You heard him.
You have 30 seconds.

03:38.537 --> 03:40.686
29, 28...

03:41.764 --> 03:43.096
Five, four,
three, two, one!

03:54.920 --> 03:57.446
Guessing I grabbed the one
with the 10-second timer.

03:57.483 --> 03:59.142
How'd he talk me
into this job?

03:59.485 --> 04:01.799
How did he talk
any of us into it?

04:05.659 --> 04:07.917
This arms dealer we're
freeing better be loaded.

04:07.959 --> 04:10.840
Arms dealer? You told
me he was a freedom fighter.

04:10.948 --> 04:14.250
Yeah, I might have exaggerated that...
Just a little bit.

04:20.019 --> 04:21.107
Yondu!

04:21.339 --> 04:23.174
I knew you'd come
for me, boyo.

04:23.209 --> 04:25.613
Once a Ravager,
always a Ravager.

04:25.638 --> 04:27.999
You dragged us
here to spring

04:28.024 --> 04:31.279
your former pirate
boss/alien abductor?

04:31.691 --> 04:33.020
Hey, we were partners.

04:33.045 --> 04:34.827
And what was I supposed
to do, tell the truth?

04:36.522 --> 04:40.188
Deceivin' your friends
just to save your mentor.

04:40.426 --> 04:42.287
I'm so proud.

04:42.809 --> 04:45.521
Yeah, about that. I'm actually
turning you in for the bounty.

04:45.622 --> 04:48.217
Oh, I taught you so well.

04:50.441 --> 04:53.449
So, what are we,
heroes or outlaws?

04:53.605 --> 04:54.886
Why can't we be both?

04:57.161 --> 04:58.622
Whoa!
- Because you can't be half

04:58.647 --> 05:00.795
a hero or half an outlaw.

05:00.850 --> 05:03.548
Right. 'Cause that'd be like trying
to be half-human, half-alien.

05:03.582 --> 05:05.360
Oh, wait. I already am.

05:07.519 --> 05:09.510
Let go!
- You let go!

05:10.840 --> 05:13.458
Whoa!

05:13.492 --> 05:15.560
Might wanna keep
your voices down

05:15.594 --> 05:17.797
before you wake
the pit leeches.

05:18.308 --> 05:19.624
Stay out of this!
- I am Groot!

05:22.501 --> 05:25.012
This is why we
need a battle cry.

05:26.032 --> 05:28.573
Hey! Whoa! Easy!

05:28.607 --> 05:29.596
Come on!

05:31.577 --> 05:34.746
How's this for a battle cry?
Let's blow stuff up!

05:41.148 --> 05:42.591
Annoying slug.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.180
Hey, hey! Whoa,
whoa, whoa! Easy!

05:49.361 --> 05:51.995
Still hanging here.
Watch your crossfire!

05:54.600 --> 05:55.376
Oh.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.246
I am Groot.

06:03.475 --> 06:05.663
The bounty better have
been worth it, Quill.

06:06.053 --> 06:08.326
Oh, I made sure it was.

06:08.686 --> 06:11.401
Otherwise, you never
would've come for me.

06:11.450 --> 06:13.307
You put the bounty
on yourself?

06:13.677 --> 06:17.300
I needed some kind of insurance
in case my deal went south,

06:17.423 --> 06:20.617
and I knew you and your zoo crew
couldn't resist them extra unit...

06:20.642 --> 06:22.236
Boyo!

06:25.191 --> 06:26.631
Hey, hey, wait.

06:26.821 --> 06:30.481
I was moving something far more valuable
than any bounty when they grabbed me!

06:31.095 --> 06:33.604
How valuable we talkin'?

06:33.639 --> 06:35.450
We're not in this
for wealth.

06:36.141 --> 06:40.811
Hey... No. Neither was the guy who took
my prize and strung me up in here.

06:41.071 --> 06:43.397
Goes by the name
of Korath.

06:48.884 --> 06:51.078
So you do remember him.

06:51.390 --> 06:52.657
How could I forget him?

06:52.863 --> 06:55.021
We were raised like
siblings by Thanos,

06:55.078 --> 06:56.902
and molded into
his enforcers.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.464
Which means he can
lead us to Thanos,

06:59.498 --> 07:02.356
and my revenge for
the loss of my family.

07:03.032 --> 07:04.897
Talk. What were
you moving?

07:04.922 --> 07:08.991
Uh, all's I know is
it's old. Real old.

07:09.156 --> 07:12.430
And there's something inside it
lots of powerful folks want.

07:13.273 --> 07:16.620
Whatever it is, we can't let
Thanos get his hands on it.

07:16.898 --> 07:19.724
Hmm. Weapon vault's
a few levels up.

07:20.111 --> 07:23.487
If it's valuable and dangerous,
that'd be where it's stashed.

07:23.555 --> 07:27.090
See? You can be a hero and
an outlaw at the same time.

07:34.433 --> 07:35.720
Hey. How's it goin'?

07:41.317 --> 07:43.934
Volcanic gas.
Nasty stuff.

07:44.848 --> 07:46.416
Groot, you're up.

07:53.736 --> 07:57.502
Ah. So the walking
houseplant's a safecracker?

07:59.194 --> 08:00.414
More ways than one.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.048
Ha!

08:05.295 --> 08:06.190
Found it!

08:07.061 --> 08:09.012
Wait. What about
the lockbox?

08:09.201 --> 08:12.239
Oh, Korath took off with that
long before you rescued me.

08:13.612 --> 08:14.363
What?

08:14.634 --> 08:17.142
You think I was gonna leave
without my personal property?

08:17.167 --> 08:19.371
I'd say it
was worth the side trip.

08:22.057 --> 08:25.070
You expect to walk out the front
door loaded down with that stuff?

08:25.350 --> 08:27.520
Who said anything
about walking?

08:30.209 --> 08:32.162
Oh, yeah!

08:35.570 --> 08:39.577
Whoo-hoo! You don't mess with the
Rocket unless you know how to fly!

08:42.433 --> 08:44.402
Which they do!

08:46.471 --> 08:49.141
I am Groot!

08:51.726 --> 08:53.239
Rocket, hang on!

08:59.999 --> 09:01.568
I am Groot!

09:05.168 --> 09:06.993
Stay away from
the bug zappers!

09:07.160 --> 09:08.724
They'll short out your jetpacks!

09:09.933 --> 09:11.294
Among other things.

09:14.876 --> 09:16.962
Two can play at
the short-out game.

09:17.837 --> 09:19.423
This is not a game.

09:21.389 --> 09:24.525
If it is...
I'm winning!

09:28.071 --> 09:29.188
I am Groot.

09:29.213 --> 09:32.751
I know, but I wanna keep my stash.
- I am Groot!

09:32.846 --> 09:36.272
I know, but there's some really
good boom sticks in there.

09:36.371 --> 09:37.809
I am Groot!

09:39.474 --> 09:41.337
Well, since you
put it that way...

09:41.676 --> 09:43.270
I'm sorry, babies.

09:44.846 --> 09:46.509
So, so sorry.

10:07.302 --> 10:09.236
♪ I sleep all day,
out all night

10:09.270 --> 10:11.372
- ♪ I know where you're goin' ♪
- Still torturin' your crew

10:11.406 --> 10:13.323
with that same
Earth racket, Quill?

10:13.348 --> 10:16.639
You know, when you pull my fat out of
the fire, you can choose the tunes.

10:18.347 --> 10:19.467
I got ya, buddy.

10:20.382 --> 10:22.376
I am Groot.

10:23.585 --> 10:24.332
Ew.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.392
There you go, bud.

10:31.426 --> 10:35.616
Nice fresh soil. Help you
grow big and strong, again.

10:36.564 --> 10:40.461
If I know Korath, he's too arrogant
to update his security protocols.

10:40.535 --> 10:43.581
And too ignorant to realize I
stole them from him long ago.

10:43.772 --> 10:47.319
Ah. Typical. He's traveling
through the Beol Asteroid Cluster

10:47.344 --> 10:49.428
to avoid detection
by the Nova Corps.

10:49.477 --> 10:51.712
But that will also
slow him down.

10:51.883 --> 10:54.615
Korath will likely keep the
box in his private quarters.

10:54.649 --> 10:57.745
I should be able to get us close
enough to sneak aboard and grab it.

10:58.149 --> 11:02.466
Then I will persuade Korath
to lead me to Thanos.

11:02.791 --> 11:05.412
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
Heel your attack dog, Quill.

11:05.838 --> 11:09.786
This is a stealth job. I can
bring one more, at most.

11:09.947 --> 11:11.801
Hey. Since when do
you give the orders?

11:11.847 --> 11:15.234
Hmm. Since I'm the one
with the key to that box.

11:15.403 --> 11:18.425
This is starting to feel
a lot more outlaw than hero.

11:20.156 --> 11:23.328
I'm broadcasting an echo signal
on Korath's private frequency

11:23.353 --> 11:25.388
to scramble his
proximity scanners.

11:26.094 --> 11:29.191
Any motion displacement will
read as just another asteroid.

11:34.371 --> 11:37.239
Which would be great
if he wasn't blowing them up!

11:38.019 --> 11:40.594
Ah! You said you
could get us aboard!

11:40.628 --> 11:43.810
I said I could get us
close enough to get aboard.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.568
Ahh. Nice flying, Gammy.

11:57.645 --> 12:00.144
For a second there,
I thought my fur was fried.

12:06.013 --> 12:07.521
Turns out I was right!

12:07.555 --> 12:08.919
We've
been breached.

12:09.324 --> 12:10.194
Groot!

12:12.460 --> 12:13.709
I am Groot.

12:20.602 --> 12:22.061
Nice save, big guy.

12:22.086 --> 12:24.359
Think you can hold that pose
while I seal the inner hatch?

12:24.415 --> 12:26.905
I am Drax the Destroyer.
I can...

12:28.968 --> 12:30.228
That was not me.

12:35.127 --> 12:37.994
Mmm, just like
old times, eh, boyo?

12:38.510 --> 12:41.093
When you gonna forget
this Guardians nonsense

12:41.118 --> 12:43.289
and come back
and work for me, huh?

12:43.625 --> 12:47.637
You was born to be a Ravager.
- I was born to live on Earth.

12:47.742 --> 12:50.780
Until you abducted me.
Mmm-mmm...

12:51.085 --> 12:54.034
I've acquired the artifact
as instructed, Lord Thanos.

12:54.059 --> 12:56.361
And the Cosmic
Seed lies within?

12:56.371 --> 12:58.331
I cannot know
for certain, my lord.

12:58.506 --> 13:00.574
The Ravager was
unable to open it,

13:00.608 --> 13:02.989
so I fed him
to the pit leeches.

13:05.513 --> 13:08.549
Do you not recognize
the insignia, Korath?

13:08.583 --> 13:12.129
Only the key
can unlock the box.

13:12.453 --> 13:16.665
Understood, my lord. I will set
course for the planet immediately.

13:43.484 --> 13:44.257
Whoa!

13:46.257 --> 13:48.281
Yondu. Lower me.

13:50.155 --> 13:52.844
I meant, "Lower me slowly."

13:57.098 --> 13:58.022
Yondu.

13:59.434 --> 14:00.400
Yondu!

14:02.503 --> 14:04.504
Oh, don't you
bail on me, dude.

14:07.098 --> 14:07.747
Oh, hey.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.344
Yeah, I was just
putting this back for you.

14:16.084 --> 14:19.944
So, the Terran rat who
calls himself "Star-Lord"

14:20.121 --> 14:22.022
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

14:22.056 --> 14:24.942
Aw, you remembered me.
That's just so nice.

14:25.423 --> 14:28.266
What was your name again?
Kor... Kory something?

14:28.787 --> 14:30.172
How is this possible?

14:31.750 --> 14:33.823
You could not have
activated this unless...

14:33.914 --> 14:35.333
I was the key.

14:35.487 --> 14:39.273
It's almost as if someone knew that
and dropped me on your doorstep.

14:39.307 --> 14:41.174
Open the box now,

14:41.242 --> 14:43.765
or I will destroy you
with your own weapon!

14:43.805 --> 14:46.813
Seriously? I mean, you're not dumb
enough to blow away your key.

14:49.050 --> 14:51.619
Oh, did I mention that
thing only works for me?

14:51.652 --> 14:55.375
You do realize that's not
the only weapon in the room.

14:56.024 --> 14:57.324
Oh, yeah.

15:00.594 --> 15:04.639
So, how's that whole "trustin' Yondu"
thing working out for you, Quill?

15:05.104 --> 15:08.800
Well, considering we got the prize
and don't have to share, not bad.

15:10.702 --> 15:11.933
If you take that,

15:12.307 --> 15:15.030
Thanos will hunt you
to the end of the universe!

15:15.243 --> 15:16.996
I will be waiting.

15:20.281 --> 15:22.806
Cloak us! Now!
- The secondary generator

15:22.831 --> 15:23.880
took on too much damage!

15:23.935 --> 15:25.537
Buy me some time
to jump-start it!

15:29.829 --> 15:32.456
They'll never navigate that
big tub through this mess.

15:36.420 --> 15:37.891
And then there's that.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.335
Energy systems
can be rerouted

15:41.369 --> 15:44.004
via nonlinear
network configuration...

15:49.410 --> 15:51.381
Commander Korath, sir?

15:51.652 --> 15:54.053
I'm afraid we've lost
the Guardians' ship.

15:54.315 --> 15:55.913
Blast me free, fool!

15:56.250 --> 15:58.722
Seriously? We're
going back to Knowhere?

15:58.867 --> 16:01.323
Didn't we nearly get this
place blowed up last time?

16:01.456 --> 16:03.362
I am Groot!

16:03.558 --> 16:05.921
What do you mean,
"nearly don't count"?

16:06.294 --> 16:07.999
I heard the broker
set up shop here.

16:08.024 --> 16:10.445
He might be able to tell us
what's inside this boom box.

16:10.498 --> 16:13.000
And shell out
big-time units for it.

16:13.178 --> 16:17.270
You ask me, we should destroy it
before Thanos gets his hands on it.

16:17.305 --> 16:21.211
But not before I've had
my revenge on him.

16:26.735 --> 16:30.572
Whose idea was it to build a space
colony inside a Celestial's head?

16:30.969 --> 16:34.503
Relax. The Celestial's been
dormant for 10.000 years.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.751
Not like it's in
any shape to complain.

16:38.623 --> 16:41.381
Ugh! This place always
gives me the creeps.

16:41.740 --> 16:44.096
Eh! Ain't nothin'
spooks me.

16:45.299 --> 16:46.466
I am Groot.

16:46.501 --> 16:49.804
Find the broker.
I will wrangle the animals.

16:53.663 --> 16:55.411
Wait. What am I runnin' for?

16:55.920 --> 16:59.213
Heel, Fido! Unless you
want to get housebroken.

17:00.820 --> 17:01.607
Ow!

17:09.223 --> 17:12.130
Back off, Spot,
or I call Security.

17:12.809 --> 17:15.068
Cosmo is Security.

17:15.229 --> 17:16.574
You talk?

17:17.020 --> 17:19.131
Please to forgive
Cosmo for chase.

17:19.290 --> 17:23.250
Sometimes old instinct to
pursue small mammal kicks in.

17:23.665 --> 17:26.272
Shake. Good humanoid.

17:26.307 --> 17:29.651
Ugh! Oh, man, talking animals
give me the willies.

17:29.955 --> 17:32.768
Eh, technically,
Cosmo not talk.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.647
Communicate telepathically.

17:36.650 --> 17:37.930
I am Groot.

17:38.286 --> 17:40.003
How should I know
why he's sniffing you?

17:40.028 --> 17:43.208
Probably another old instinct.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:43.291 --> 17:47.321
Based on the insignia, this
is clearly Spartax in origin.

17:47.781 --> 17:49.800
Just like your sidearm.

17:49.921 --> 17:51.128
Uh, say what now?

17:54.268 --> 17:55.368
Oh!

17:55.403 --> 17:58.050
They're both keys
to a DNA lock.

17:58.372 --> 18:01.122
Pure Spartax workmanship.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.619
So this thing
only works for me...

18:04.211 --> 18:06.222
Because I'm part Spartax?

18:14.155 --> 18:14.892
Ah.

18:23.039 --> 18:26.429
Peter, my little Star-Lord.

18:27.301 --> 18:30.172
You all right, Quill?
- Ugh! Yeah.

18:30.928 --> 18:32.764
Yeah... fine.

18:32.809 --> 18:35.873
Cosmo was originally part
of Soviet space program.

18:36.075 --> 18:38.642
Fascinating. I have no
idea what that means.

18:38.879 --> 18:39.959
Does not matter.

18:40.098 --> 18:43.303
Capsule... How you say...
Lost in space.

18:43.384 --> 18:45.811
Cosmo taken to lab
and experimented on.

18:45.915 --> 18:47.701
Heh. What a co-winky-dink.

18:47.726 --> 18:49.845
I was...
- Lab experiment too.

18:49.870 --> 18:52.271
Cosmo know.
Cosmo read rodent's mind.

18:52.560 --> 18:56.491
Who you calling rodent,
you mangy little... Huh?

19:00.115 --> 19:01.059
Rodent!

19:08.409 --> 19:09.890
I am Groot!

19:12.928 --> 19:15.939
So, these Spartax aliens,
are they, like, cool?

19:16.059 --> 19:17.560
'Cause they sound like
a bunch of farmers

19:17.585 --> 19:20.320
with this whole "Cosmic Seed" thing here.
- What? Don't open it!

19:20.692 --> 19:23.330
The Cosmic Seed is not
something to be trifled with!

19:23.357 --> 19:26.826
No deal! Get it away
from my shop! Now!

19:27.228 --> 19:31.130
I've got a better idea. Let's toss
it into the nearest black hole.

19:35.560 --> 19:38.367
Aw, now, that'd be
a waste of my prize.

19:38.686 --> 19:41.114
You set me up! You knew
the box was worthless

19:41.139 --> 19:43.661
without me as the key,
so you sold me out to Korath!

19:43.874 --> 19:46.414
Oh, and thanks for letting
me know I'm half Spartax.

19:46.447 --> 19:47.964
Whatever that is!

19:47.989 --> 19:50.291
You sold me out, boyo!

19:53.554 --> 19:56.663
Never bothered to come back
for your old mentor, did you?

19:56.696 --> 19:59.123
I barely gave Korath
the slip on my own.

19:59.805 --> 20:02.837
Maybe Korath let you escape so you
could lead him straight to me.

20:02.977 --> 20:04.404
Impossible.

20:05.670 --> 20:06.321
Huh?

20:20.288 --> 20:22.034
Ah!
- Totally called it.

20:46.893 --> 20:49.049
Miss me, sister?

20:52.074 --> 20:54.703
I never miss, brother.

20:55.647 --> 20:57.621
Just like old times,
eh, boyo?

20:57.712 --> 20:59.940
I'll let you in
on a little secret, Yondu.

21:00.287 --> 21:02.157
The old times were lousy!

21:07.947 --> 21:09.620
I'll take that, thank you.

21:10.001 --> 21:11.678
Like chud you will!

21:13.872 --> 21:15.709
All occupants
to take cover!

21:15.916 --> 21:17.445
Is not drill!

21:18.305 --> 21:21.445
Knowhere is... Alive!

21:29.450 --> 21:32.501
Okay, I really,
really hate that sound.
