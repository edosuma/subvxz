WEBVTT

00:10.240 --> 00:11.880
We are here today

00:11.880 --> 00:14.200
to mourn the loss
of a very special young woman.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.560
Forgetab...

00:16.640 --> 00:20.000
Laura Cunningham, who was the captain
of the debating team.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.840
Oh, my mistake, dear. Of course.
Formidable cox in the rowing team.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.000
Sorry, Sister. That was actually me.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.680
Uh, back-up dancer
in the "Rock is Dead" vid?

00:30.680 --> 00:32.280
- Before our time.
- Oh, Christ on a bike,

00:32.280 --> 00:34.040
- just hit the tape, Genevieve.

00:35.040 --> 00:39.720
<i>♪ Amazing grace ♪</i>

00:40.200 --> 00:45.040
<i>♪ How sweet the sound ♪</i>

00:45.040 --> 00:46.960
Nice of you to mourn me, ladies.

00:51.240 --> 00:52.080
Oh, no.

00:53.320 --> 00:56.040
- Just a pity I'm not dead.
- This is actually for me.

00:56.280 --> 00:57.880
- No, no, no.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.160
Run, Saskia!

01:00.320 --> 01:01.840
I can explain. I've changed.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.400
That's okay. I can pivot.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.280
- Yah!

01:06.280 --> 01:09.840
- Figures. Revenge kick to the cunt.
- Totes justified.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.880
No, no, no, no, Sandra Dee, Sandra Dee,
you don't have to do this.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.640
Whoa. Hey, Sandy. Whoa!

01:14.880 --> 01:16.520
What has Zoe ever done to you, huh?

01:16.800 --> 01:18.920
- Are you serious? She...
- Okay!

01:19.400 --> 01:20.440
I...

01:21.120 --> 01:23.240
- I...
-  Spit it out, Zoe!

01:23.240 --> 01:26.640
I helped Saskia push Sandy out to sea.

01:26.640 --> 01:27.960
-  There it is.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.520
- And you've just been sitting on this?
- I know, I hate myself.

01:30.520 --> 01:32.560
Especially after everything
we put Saskia through?

01:32.560 --> 01:34.240
-  I wish I was dead.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.320
What's wrong with you...

01:37.800 --> 01:39.680
Son of a bitch!

01:41.840 --> 01:43.760
In the back, Sandy? You kidding me?

01:43.760 --> 01:46.960
You're a backstabbing bitch, Zoe.
Backstabbing bitches get backstabbed.

01:46.960 --> 01:47.960
And you!

01:48.440 --> 01:49.920
Me? What did I do?

01:50.600 --> 01:52.600
Catch on, girls. Catch on.

01:58.680 --> 02:02.320
Hold me down all you like, ladies.
The damage is already done.

02:05.240 --> 02:08.240
Don't you love the smell of smoked lettuce
in the morning, girls?

02:08.240 --> 02:10.240
Oh, shit. The crops!

02:14.080 --> 02:15.160
Sorry.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.440
Well, they do say revenge
is a dish best served char grilled.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.960
I just came back to fuck you all up
and starve you out,

02:30.960 --> 02:33.960
so if someone would kindly return
my D'Amiré bag, I will be on my way

02:33.960 --> 02:35.720
and Teresa will be coming with me.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.800
- Sandy, what is your problem?

02:37.800 --> 02:39.160
Yeah, Sandy, what the hell?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Oh, it stinks.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.160
Seagull.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.960
Goes down smooth,
doesn't always stay there.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.080
What's out there, Sandy?

02:50.080 --> 02:51.840
- How's the market?
- Is Brisbane gone?

02:51.840 --> 02:53.160
Is there anything left?

02:55.720 --> 02:57.360
There's nothing, okay?

02:57.960 --> 03:00.120
Just endless fucking ocean.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.280
Hey, Mels.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.920
Does that mean that my embryos are gone?

03:16.920 --> 03:19.560
Mels, could you... Little help here?

03:19.880 --> 03:21.760
Yeah, no.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.000
That's not something
that I can help you with.

03:24.760 --> 03:27.960
In fact, uh, ladies,
just a public service announcement.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.120
Zoe is not to be helped, okay?

03:30.120 --> 03:33.400
If she asks you to take the knife
out of her backstabbing back,

03:33.400 --> 03:35.760
- please politely decline.
-  Yeah, the old freeze out.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.960
I know what that feels like.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.360
-  That is exactly what I mean.
-  Okay, what have I missed?

03:39.360 --> 03:41.560
I didn't know what Saskia
was making me do.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.480
- It was pretty obvious.
- And also, I've been stabbed.

03:44.480 --> 03:47.400
- I'm a victim.
-  Oh, my God.

03:48.320 --> 03:51.640
Okay, ladies of Ridge Heights,
let's not panic.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.800
Things will regrow in a month,

03:54.240 --> 03:56.880
or three, and in the meantime,
we'll ration these out.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.920
What's 12 cherry tomatoes
divided by the whole class

03:59.920 --> 04:01.280
multiplied by a month?

04:02.600 --> 04:03.880
I'm not doing this.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.960
Well, we all know maths
isn't your strong suit, Amelia.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.160
- Anyone else?
- No, I mean,

04:08.160 --> 04:10.160
if this is the last of the food,

04:10.640 --> 04:15.040
if the proposition is half
a fucking lettuce leaf a day and...

04:16.120 --> 04:18.240
if no one is coming to save us, then...

04:21.120 --> 04:23.120
I think we're done here, right?

04:23.120 --> 04:24.160
Huh?

04:24.520 --> 04:28.000
What the hell?
No, we're not done here, Amelia.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.320
- Yeah. We should finish my funeral first.
- Excuse me. We're ignoring her.

04:31.320 --> 04:32.520
Oh, sorry.

04:32.520 --> 04:33.600
Come on, guys.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.800
Did we really think that
of all the people on the planet,

04:37.440 --> 04:39.880
we were the only ones
that were meant to survive?

04:40.160 --> 04:43.200
That's, like, the most millennial thing
I've ever fucking heard.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.240
Yeah, but we know how to do this.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.000
We know how to survive.
We just have to re-plan.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.680
- No.
- We didn't just make fire.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.240
We made electricity, you know?

04:52.360 --> 04:53.720
We're pretty much a week away

04:53.720 --> 04:56.040
from reinventing social media
at this point.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.080
- Come on, guys.
-  But it doesn't matter.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.640
Because what's the point?

05:00.160 --> 05:03.240
There's no finish line, right?
When does it end?

05:03.880 --> 05:06.920
We say when it ends.
We survived longer than most,

05:07.040 --> 05:08.920
that's great,
but we're not going to beat this.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.560
It's a fucking apocalypse.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.800
Hang on.
Do we really believe that this chick

05:12.920 --> 05:15.880
- survived out at sea by herself?
- Look at her.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.640
Sandy couldn't even go
to the tuck shop alone.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.320
Are we actually going to top ourselves

05:20.320 --> 05:23.480
because this fucking lunatic claims
that there's no one else out there?

05:24.760 --> 05:26.240
I know we're supposed
to be freezing her out

05:26.240 --> 05:28.280
but are you pitching we kill ourselves?

05:28.280 --> 05:31.720
No, I'm pitching that we stop
exhausting ourselves with survival.

05:31.720 --> 05:32.840
It's the same thing.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.880
I'm pitching that, that,

05:34.880 --> 05:37.720
that we actually enjoy ourselves
for one fucking minute

05:37.720 --> 05:40.400
and then we meet our fate head on.

05:40.800 --> 05:41.720
I'm pitching...

05:42.640 --> 05:45.040
I guess I'm pitching
a fucking farewell party.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.880
Oh, 'cause now you're fun.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.960
Fuck it. I'm in.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.400
No, you're coming with me.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.520
Sandy, stop!

05:57.000 --> 05:59.280
Everything I've been holding on for
is gone.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.560
My husband, my embryos, my entire life.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.640
Let's cook everything we have left over
in the tuck shop.

06:05.640 --> 06:07.760
None of this watery lentil shit.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.920
- I'm in.
-  All right. Cool.

06:10.920 --> 06:14.240
I've got some moonshine ready to roll
if you want to up the ante.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.680
- Yes.
- Oh, shut the fuck up, Tegan.

06:16.680 --> 06:20.080
Um, sorry, guys,
but we are not having a party.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.720
Thank you, Pepé. Jesus.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.360
Because the party to end
all parties isn't called a party.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.560
It's called a motherfucking
end-of-year formal!

06:38.480 --> 06:40.720
Let's talk themes for the formal.

06:40.720 --> 06:43.760
I've already vetoed Under the Sea
because it's too on-the-nose.

06:43.760 --> 06:47.960
And I think what might be better
is A Night in Paris.

06:47.960 --> 06:51.760
Guys, let's not overthink this.
The theme is obviously...

06:52.760 --> 06:54.000
Last Night on Earth.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.240
Mmm.

06:55.240 --> 06:59.040
No? I'm sorry. I'm just a bit excited.
I missed the formal the first time around.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.560
You missed the Diplo incident then.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.000
- Uh, Forgettable Laura, shh!

07:03.000 --> 07:04.080
No, no, no...

07:04.080 --> 07:05.280
The Diplo incident?

07:05.280 --> 07:08.760
Genevieve was scammed by a fake Diplo
who said he'd DJ our formal

07:08.760 --> 07:11.200
if she collected $20,000
from the student body.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.480
It was a very convincing email chain.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.040
And then Saskia, she got...

07:15.040 --> 07:17.200
I asked my dad to book Thirsty Merc
at the last minute,

07:17.200 --> 07:20.080
and people still talk
about that party to this day.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.480
- What?
- So, yeah,

07:21.480 --> 07:23.640
I know I'm not, like, "officially"
on the planning committee,

07:23.640 --> 07:24.960
but if you need any help...

07:24.960 --> 07:25.960
No, you're not.

07:25.960 --> 07:29.160
Genevieve, the more, the merrier.
Get in here.

07:29.160 --> 07:30.280
Amazing.

07:31.160 --> 07:35.720
So, guys, this is the last party
that humankind will ever throw,

07:35.720 --> 07:37.760
so I want all your bad ideas.

07:38.520 --> 07:41.200
We could have a buffet
with the last of the food.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.960
I love that, but bigger. A bacchanal!

07:43.960 --> 07:46.800
- Yo, I went to a foam party once.
- Doesn't mean you should do it again.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.240
Foam is a must. As is a fight club.
I've always wanted to fuck a bitch up.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.040
Ooh, does anybody know how to fight well?

07:52.040 --> 07:53.760
What about a makeup station?

07:53.760 --> 07:56.280
I have always wanted a fringe.

07:56.280 --> 07:59.000
There was a front flip I never landed
in Year 9 P.E.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.840
I'm going to find that mini-tramp.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.640
Prove Mr. Frankopoulous wrong.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.480
Great. We should, um,
we should write this down.

08:07.480 --> 08:08.680
Don't you think?

08:08.680 --> 08:12.600
Uh, committee chair
has right of the whiteboard markers.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.880
- Thank you.
- Oh, okay. Yeah.

08:15.280 --> 08:18.280
I'm just trying to help if it's...

08:19.640 --> 08:21.520
Okay, sorry. Yeah.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.480
You guys work on that.

08:23.880 --> 08:26.560
I'm going to go find those
unfun mushrooms to cook up.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.480
Who knows?
Maybe I'll even find some fun ones.

08:33.800 --> 08:35.200
Where's that chick been hiding, right?

08:35.200 --> 08:36.440
Don't distract.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.880
Sister, this party, I've begged them
not to go through with it,

08:43.880 --> 08:46.520
but somebody with a bit of authority
needs to put a stop to all this.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.840
Real friggin' mature
for a woman of the cloth.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.880
You know, a freeze out doesn't mean
you literally freeze, right?

09:00.880 --> 09:04.400
Wait. Are you...
Are you going to this thing?

09:05.320 --> 09:07.000
Fucking unbelievable.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.320
Can you at least help me
get this knife out of my back?

09:10.880 --> 09:13.640
If Year 9 religion taught me anything,
it's that your boy JC

09:13.640 --> 09:17.480
was only on the cross for an hour
before they took mercy on him, so...

09:18.000 --> 09:20.160
- Six.
- Come again?

09:20.160 --> 09:24.120
My boy JC was on the cross for six hours,

09:24.840 --> 09:26.240
so you have a ways to go.

09:28.880 --> 09:29.760
Useless!

09:42.600 --> 09:45.440
Look at you,
struggling without your little sidekick.

09:45.440 --> 09:47.240
At least Tegan would be a match for me.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.760
Tegan is her own person

09:49.520 --> 09:51.360
upon whom I no longer co-depend.

09:51.360 --> 09:54.520
-  Whoa! You psycho pirate.

09:56.240 --> 09:57.880
I never did sports, so you better hope

09:58.000 --> 10:00.640
I don't accidentally hit some something
I wasn't aiming for.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.200
Get me Teresa and my bag.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.760
Why are you so obsessed
with Teresa?

10:18.080 --> 10:19.880
- Ugh.
- How dare you?

10:19.880 --> 10:21.640
Lamington's an Australian delicacy.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.720
What time's your flight again,
you ungrateful shit?

10:23.720 --> 10:25.520
Let us call you a cab.

10:25.640 --> 10:29.120
Or better yet, customs.
Someone deport this loser ASAP!

10:29.120 --> 10:32.160
Get out of Australia.
Right now. First flight back.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.480
Pack your bags and leave.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.880
Don't think about
your embryos, Teabag.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.040
Think about the party!

10:37.040 --> 10:40.760
Since you've managed to convince everyone
on this stupid island not to help me,

10:40.760 --> 10:44.280
including a nun, who seems to have
forgotten the virtue of forgiveness,

10:44.280 --> 10:46.600
I guess I'm gonna have to get
this bad boy out myself.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.040
Oh, fuck.

10:49.480 --> 10:50.320
Ow!

10:50.640 --> 10:52.280
I think she got a nerve or something.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.120
Ah! Yes, you did it. The last chicken.

10:58.640 --> 11:01.120
Great work, Forgettable Laura.
Let's find a cage for it.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.480
I don't want to kill it yet.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.040
I have grand plans for you,
my Kentucky fried friend.

11:08.800 --> 11:09.920
Can you hear yourself?

11:12.560 --> 11:17.480
So I'm the bad guy because I pushed
one lousy person out to sea,

11:17.480 --> 11:20.000
and yet you are about
to lead our entire class

11:20.000 --> 11:23.280
into some kind of Jonestown situation,
and you're whistling while you work.

11:25.960 --> 11:26.880
Are you okay?

11:28.920 --> 11:30.440
Is this because you're off your meds?

11:32.760 --> 11:35.640
I've been off my meds a day, you dickhead.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.200
What you're actually witnessing, Zoe,

11:38.200 --> 11:41.240
is the lightness of not caring about,

11:41.240 --> 11:44.600
about the future, about survival.

11:44.600 --> 11:48.760
But most importantly about you.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.360
I don't have to think about
how much longer we're going to be

11:51.360 --> 11:55.040
stuck here together because
it's just all gonna be over soon.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.480
And I just... I can't bloody wait.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.960
Look, I know I let you down, okay?

12:02.960 --> 12:05.440
So, fine, give up on me. No problem.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.920
But please, Mels, don't give up on this.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.760
Don't give up on surviving.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.840
Mushies are ready, Teabag.

12:14.000 --> 12:14.920
Watch your back.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.360
It just shit on me.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.800
Let's see you bitches
have a party without music!

13:35.400 --> 13:37.240
- Teresa!

13:37.240 --> 13:38.720
What the fuck, Sandy?

13:38.720 --> 13:40.360
Teresa, get back here!

13:42.160 --> 13:43.200
Teresa!

13:43.200 --> 13:44.760
Get the hell back in here.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.040
Ugh!

13:47.000 --> 13:47.920
Shut up!

13:54.320 --> 13:55.960
- Come on, you little bitch!

13:59.200 --> 14:01.840
- Oh, my God, this is amazing.
- Wow.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.160
What?

14:04.840 --> 14:07.560
Oh, my God!

14:07.560 --> 14:08.560
Yay.

14:08.560 --> 14:12.400
Okay, this almost trumps Thirsty Merc.
Saskia strikes again.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.000
It was actually all Genevieve.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.320
The creative vision, the logistics,
the styling.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.600
I mean, no one else is fit to plan
the last formal in human history. Right?

14:21.040 --> 14:22.160
Good job.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.280
Come in!

14:23.800 --> 14:27.320
I just, you know, broke up
some foam pieces for the pit and stuff.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.320
Hey, did you see the graffiti?

14:29.320 --> 14:30.600
It was all Genevieve.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.440
Can you believe it?
This all just came from her head.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.440
- She's a mastermind.
- Just shit on me already, would you?

14:36.880 --> 14:39.520
This fake nice bullshit is so much worse.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.120
But I'm not being fake. I'm...

14:44.600 --> 14:46.440
Hey, I thought that we were okay.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.800
I am sorry, Genevieve.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.880
Let the beat drop.

14:53.880 --> 14:56.560
- Whoo!

14:58.480 --> 14:59.840
What the hell is this shit?

14:59.840 --> 15:01.840
Christian rock
is all that was left.

15:01.840 --> 15:05.160
Zoe snapped all the CDs.
I had to improvise.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.200
Oh, yeah, okay, improvise...

15:07.200 --> 15:10.160
Hey, you're gonna dance
and you're gonna like it, okay?

15:10.160 --> 15:13.200
Five, six, seven, eight, and dance.

15:26.080 --> 15:29.760
Look, I can't change the fact
that I fucked you up, but...

15:31.440 --> 15:35.360
you spent all of high school
making things happen for everyone else.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.360
And I just...
I think you deserve to enjoy yourself.

15:38.360 --> 15:41.000
- Okay, but the drink allocations...
- Is something I can handle.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.800
Now, scull, Genevieve.

15:46.560 --> 15:49.640
Scull, scull, scull, scull, scull, scull.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.760
Okay. Okay.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.560
Scull, scull, scull!

16:04.120 --> 16:05.760
Go, go, go, go!

16:05.760 --> 16:06.840
Whoa!

16:10.720 --> 16:12.240
Fuck you, Franko.

16:12.240 --> 16:15.720
Zero out of ten for skill,
but ten out of ten for lols, right, Megs?

16:26.720 --> 16:28.200
I've got to get my bucket back!

16:30.560 --> 16:34.240
Amelia. Amelia. Please don't do this.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.200
Oh! Did no one tell you, Zoe?
You're not invited.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.400
Megan, this is dumb.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.640
- What?

16:46.040 --> 16:48.880
Her feet are like a vice.
It makes no sense.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.080
Okay. Um...

16:52.360 --> 16:55.000
-  Fuck, fuck, fuck!
- Oh, my God.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.400
Who nipple cripples?

16:56.400 --> 16:58.280
Megan, what do I do?
Do I pull her off or what?

16:58.280 --> 17:00.600
Don't pull her off,
my nips will rip with her!

17:00.600 --> 17:02.080
Okay, um, um...

17:05.080 --> 17:07.080
Fucking cunt, you let go!

17:07.080 --> 17:08.400
Not until you let go of Megan.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.080
Why the fuck do you even care?
You're not even friends anymore.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.440
Get me Teresa and I'll let go.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.080
Okay, yeah, maybe we weren't friends,
but then I realized everyone sucks.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.200
Took you long enough.

17:17.200 --> 17:20.160
Yes, and I realized, hey, 18-year-old me
thought she wanted more friends.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.680
Oh, my gosh. She's twisting.

17:22.680 --> 17:25.320
Yeah, but then I thought
18-year-old me also thought she liked boys

17:25.320 --> 17:26.720
and that cargo pants
were the height of fashion.

17:26.720 --> 17:29.000
- And I'm really sorry.
- Apology accepted.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.520
-  Get her off.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.960
You two literally make me sick.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.160
I am so proud of you for getting sober,

17:41.160 --> 17:43.520
but you should just ditch her
and come to formal with me, okay?

17:43.520 --> 17:45.960
- Really?
- It's the last party ever, so who cares?

17:45.960 --> 17:51.520
Oh, I want to but, if I'm being honest,
I sort of like being off the booze.

17:52.760 --> 17:53.920
I just...

17:54.480 --> 17:58.560
I feel things again,
and if this really is the last party ever,

18:00.080 --> 18:01.440
I want to feel that, too.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.320
Wow. Okay.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.240
Ooh!

18:06.800 --> 18:08.800
I didn't think I'd ever say this, but, um,

18:09.320 --> 18:11.320
fuck it, let's just go sober.

18:12.760 --> 18:15.800
Reckon we can just tie her up again
and leave her?

18:15.920 --> 18:17.080
You're thinking with your noggin.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.920
Start thinking with your nips.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.320
Let's go.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.080
Hey, buddy.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.080
Thought this might
make you feel a bit better.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.760
Just...

19:03.280 --> 19:04.400
Um...

19:06.080 --> 19:08.400
It was a bit of a dog move,
what Sas and I did to you.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.480
I'm sorry, Sandy. Really.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.520
You can't carry the weak.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.680
That's survival. I get it.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.880
Should've seen it coming, really.
The three of you never wanted me around.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.720
What do you mean, three of us?

19:24.720 --> 19:26.800
Teresa wasn't there
the night we pushed you out.

19:27.800 --> 19:28.720
Exactly.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.920
<i>She never led the charge,
but she never stopped</i>

19:30.920 --> 19:32.960
the two of you from shitting
on me either, so...

19:35.040 --> 19:36.200
Oh, yes!

19:36.760 --> 19:39.640
I'm learning it's the things you don't say
that get you in the most trouble.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.160
Oh, God.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.000
I keep forgetting.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.520
Oh, I don't know, Sandy.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.880
I spent my whole life
trying to fit in with those girls.

19:49.880 --> 19:53.640
And now, because of what I did to you,
I've just completely stuffed it up.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.440
But... it's not fair that you lose out

19:57.440 --> 19:58.920
just because I'm a desperate numpty.

19:58.920 --> 20:01.160
- So you'll free me?
- Hell, no.

20:01.160 --> 20:04.080
Are you kidding me? You've got fucking
seagull heads around your neck.

20:04.760 --> 20:08.640
No, but us rejects
deserve a last supper, too.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.200
So what do you say I get us some food?

20:10.880 --> 20:12.720
- I presume you're still gluten-free?
- Hmm.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.560
My microbiota is still clean as fuck.

20:16.320 --> 20:17.440
Great.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.640
- Hey, Zo.
-  Mmm?

20:21.200 --> 20:22.160
Thanks for my bag.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.320
It's a D'Amiré, don't you know?

20:36.040 --> 20:37.160
No way.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.480
Hello, mate.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.400
Go on, bud. Go on, mate, be free.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.400
Here. Here we go.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.240
There you go, buddy.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.520
- Go on. Be free.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.000
Eggies.

21:07.240 --> 21:08.680
Yes. Fucking hell.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.640
Hope you like sunny side up.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.080
Fuck.

21:17.760 --> 21:20.520
Oh! Lady Pirate totally played me.

21:24.200 --> 21:28.080
Disgusting, Sandy.

21:40.160 --> 21:44.240
Hey! Ho! Hey! Ho!

21:44.560 --> 21:45.720
- Hey!
- Hi!

21:45.720 --> 21:47.720
You naughty girl! How did you get out?

21:47.720 --> 21:49.400
Want a drink? They're the best.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.800
Drinking is the best.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.880
No, thanks, not drinking right now.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.400
Whoo!

21:58.520 --> 22:00.440
Fight club's over there, ladies.

22:08.640 --> 22:11.000
When did you get
so freakishly strong?

22:11.000 --> 22:12.880
Six months, you little bitch!

22:12.880 --> 22:14.560
-  Hey!
-  Where the hell are we going?

22:14.560 --> 22:16.080
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

22:16.800 --> 22:20.080
If you are planning to kill Teresa
just because she never stuck up for you,

22:20.080 --> 22:22.920
at least cover up your vomity footprints,
you dum-dum.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.680
Uh, wrong. Need her alive.

22:24.680 --> 22:29.520
Oh, okay, well, you also can't force her
to live out at sea

22:29.520 --> 22:31.520
until she admits
that she's your best friend

22:31.520 --> 22:33.720
in some kind of
Stockholm syndrome situation.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.160
Wait, wait a second.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.520
What is that?

22:40.160 --> 22:43.360
You went to the party and gorged yourself.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.520
I made us eggs, Sandy.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.440
- What? No, Zoe.
- How thick are you?

22:47.440 --> 22:49.680
No, it's not a food baby.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.280
It's a baby-baby.

22:52.160 --> 22:53.520
That explains the vomiting.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.840
- She's fucking pregnant, Zoe.
- Wait.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.000
- How?
- How?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.920
Okay, well, when a man and a woman
love each other very much,

23:00.920 --> 23:03.000
and they decide to-- Fuck you, skank!

23:03.000 --> 23:05.320
Do you know how lonely
it was for me out there?

23:05.320 --> 23:07.440
You'd fuck a Spanish canoeist
named Raul too.

23:07.440 --> 23:10.880
Wait. That means that there's
not nobody else out there.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.680
That there's at least
a fucking Raul out there.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.960
- You lied to us, Sandy.
- Yeah, I lied, Zoe. Have you met me?

23:16.960 --> 23:18.480
It was the only way to convince Teresa

23:18.480 --> 23:21.640
to give up on her sad little sea monkeys
and come and raise my kid at sea.

23:21.640 --> 23:24.120
Sandy, you can't just replace my embryos.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.200
No, no, no. Please go back to the bit

23:26.200 --> 23:28.280
about there being
other people alive out there.

23:28.280 --> 23:30.560
- Thank you.
- Why the hell not, Teresa?

23:31.080 --> 23:33.600
Is this not everything
you have ever wanted?

23:34.240 --> 23:36.400
You know what? As far as I'm concerned
you've been a freaking

23:36.400 --> 23:38.320
dumpster fire of a friend
and you basically owe me.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.000
- So, let's go.
- Sandy. Sandy.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.520
Who else is out there?

23:41.520 --> 23:44.320
Oh, people, Zoe. People, okay?

23:44.320 --> 23:46.280
There's disease-riddled cruise ships.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.160
There's floating villages
of cargo freight.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.040
There's a gang of kids from Perth
on jet skis that terrorize fatbergians.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.640
Happy? Now get in the boat, Teresa.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.280
- No, no, no! No!
- Sandy!

23:54.960 --> 23:58.200
You're not going anywhere.
You are going to march back up there,

23:58.200 --> 24:01.520
and you're gonna tell those women what
you know before they eat all the food.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.640
Are you joking?

24:05.280 --> 24:07.840
What do I owe those girls, Zoe? Hmm?

24:07.840 --> 24:11.040
A shitty year in bumfuck nowhere
and a gentle push to my death.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.040
The only reason I came back here
is to fuck you all up,

24:15.040 --> 24:16.480
take Teresa and...

24:28.720 --> 24:31.320
Whoa, whoa. What the fucking fuck, mate?

24:31.320 --> 24:33.680
Zoe, Zoe, Zoe.
You don't need to do that, okay?

24:33.680 --> 24:35.560
Yes, I know. This is incredibly uncool.

24:35.560 --> 24:39.600
I feel very, very yucky about it.
But you left me no choice, Sandy.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.480
Now you come up here
and you tell them the truth.

24:44.200 --> 24:47.000
Hey, everyone,
stop what you're doing and listen.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.200
- T., please come back.
-  Fuck this!

24:52.200 --> 24:54.880
Hey, guys, do you remember
when you were really angry with...

24:55.560 --> 24:57.320
Do you guys remember
when you were really angry with me

24:57.320 --> 24:59.560
because I didn't tell you
that the world was ending?

24:59.560 --> 25:02.000
Do you remember?
This is like the opposite of that.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.680
Okay? Because...
This is like the opposite of that

25:04.680 --> 25:07.160
because there are people out there.
Jesus Christ.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.280
Amelia!

25:14.800 --> 25:17.880
Hey, Amelia. Jesus Christ, Bicky!

25:17.880 --> 25:19.520
Teresa! Teresa!

25:19.920 --> 25:20.920
Amelia!

25:22.800 --> 25:24.880
Testing, testing, <i>un, deux, trois.</i>

25:25.320 --> 25:26.760
All right, dickheads, listen up.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.120
Amelia, I need to tell you something.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.800
-  Oh, boo!

25:34.960 --> 25:36.440
Who let her in?

25:36.440 --> 25:37.760
All right, ladies. You know the drill.

25:38.440 --> 25:39.920
- Ignore her.
- Amelia...

25:40.400 --> 25:42.320
Oh, my God, guys!

25:42.840 --> 25:43.920
Shame!

25:45.760 --> 25:48.400
As you all know, I never got
to make my school captain speech...

25:48.400 --> 25:49.520
Amelia!

25:49.760 --> 25:51.440
Oh, my God. Have some respect.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.200
...because I ran off
with the groundskeeper

25:53.200 --> 25:54.960
and got knocked up
with triplets, et cetera.

25:57.120 --> 26:02.000
Uh, anyway, I thought
I would do it now. Yeah!

26:05.000 --> 26:06.440
Amelia!

26:08.240 --> 26:10.400
Ladies of Ridge Heights.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.280
What a six months we have had, huh?

26:17.720 --> 26:19.800
Highs, lows.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.040
- Lows
- Massive lows, though,

26:22.040 --> 26:23.480
if we're honest.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.880
But look at us now.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.960
Standing on the precipice of nothing.

26:33.720 --> 26:38.880
Staring at our big, bright futures
that do not exist.

26:39.280 --> 26:42.120
But we are not daunted.

26:42.120 --> 26:45.120
So raise your glasses to...

26:45.480 --> 26:47.480
to finally getting a fringe

26:47.480 --> 26:49.960
- and oblivion!

26:49.960 --> 26:51.760
Fucking fringe? What?

26:56.880 --> 26:59.320
Without further ado,
let me introduce to you ladies,

26:59.320 --> 27:01.080
the guest of honor tonight...

27:01.760 --> 27:04.200
the last chicken!

27:16.920 --> 27:18.120
Let me tell you,

27:18.120 --> 27:21.080
this little lady was not as ready
as us to meet her maker.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.680
- Coward!
-  That's right, Genevieve.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.280
Somehow she escaped the tuck shop

27:25.280 --> 27:28.240
and I found her taking
a vengeful little shit in the bubblers.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.120
I've shit around the place.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.840
But behold, ladies.

27:31.840 --> 27:37.040
Behold the last thing we will ever eat.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.360
You've left me no choice.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.080
Wet willy, motherfuckers!

28:04.200 --> 28:05.920
Guys, Sandy's pregnant!

28:08.360 --> 28:09.480
And there's still people out there.

28:12.880 --> 28:14.520
My bad?

28:14.520 --> 28:16.480
So stop fucking eating.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.720
Okay? Because there's still hope.
We can still survive.

28:20.200 --> 28:21.400
Yay!

28:23.720 --> 28:28.280
Oh, um, that's lovely, dear,
but you've just killed the last chicken.

28:35.480 --> 28:36.440
Shit.
