- What's going on, guys?
- Funky...

1:23:49.141 --> 1:23:52.184
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

1:23:52.352 --> 1:23:55.730
Guess not. Gum?

1:23:58.859 --> 1:24:03.571
Changing the answers on the S.A.T.'s so you
can sell more drugs. It's clever, Marlon.

1:24:03.739 --> 1:24:07.491
Twisted, but clever
nonetheless.

1:24:07.659 --> 1:24:10.244
Should make for a great story.

1:24:10.412 --> 1:24:12.538
Bad move, Funky.

1:24:12.706 --> 1:24:15.291
Open that window
and bring him over.

1:24:21.715 --> 1:24:25.426
Okay, here's the real story.
Bobby Funky made a few bad decisions,

1:24:25.594 --> 1:24:27.970
lost his girlfriend and up
and jumped out the window.

1:24:28.138 --> 1:24:31.223
- Just another tormented freshman.
- I'm a sophomore, dick!

1:24:33.143 --> 1:24:37.104
- Throw his ass out.
- [Coughs] You won't do it.

1:24:37.189 --> 1:24:40.149
Oh, I won't? These sorts of
things happen all the time.

1:24:40.317 --> 1:24:43.402
There's a lot of pressure
here at St. Donovan's.

1:24:43.570 --> 1:24:45.821
Throw him out!

1:24:47.074 --> 1:24:49.116
Fine. I'll do it myself.

1:24:49.201 --> 1:24:53.663
- Hey! Let him go!
- Hey, hey! Ahh! Ahh! Calmate.

1:24:53.830 --> 1:24:56.123
Put him down!
Delicately.

1:24:56.208 --> 1:25:00.378
- How'd they know you were here?
- I might have made an announcement.

1:25:02.214 --> 1:25:04.215

1:25:15.978 --> 1:25:17.228

[Bobby Narrating] Bob Woodward once said
that the first rule of good journalism...

1:25:23.527 --> 1:25:27.029
is never reveal the story
before it goes to print.

1:25:27.197 --> 1:25:30.658
But Woodward wasn't in love
with Francesca Fachini.

1:25:30.826 --> 1:25:35.162
Before I cleared my name with the school,
I had to clear it with her.

1:25:35.288 --> 1:25:38.499
I had to tell her
I'd figured it all out.
