00:45.333 --> 00:47.434
Alright, baby.
I'll only be a second.

00:47.468 --> 00:49.135
You see that building?

00:49.169 --> 00:51.103
In two minutes,
I'll be right out.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.805
You okay?

00:52.839 --> 00:54.239
Yeah.

00:54.274 --> 00:55.974
I love you.

01:12.627 --> 01:13.961
Michael Chen?

01:27.310 --> 01:31.213
If you ever say anything
about what you just saw...

01:32.215 --> 01:33.849
I will find you.

01:33.883 --> 01:35.918
I'll kill your mommy
and then...

01:37.654 --> 01:39.254
and then I'll kill your daddy.

01:40.290 --> 01:42.291
Do you understand me?

02:02.379 --> 02:03.579
Hey!

02:04.114 --> 02:06.248
Get away from her!
What are you doing?

02:16.526 --> 02:19.127
Back up to the eighth floor.
Travis is trying to escape.

02:20.596 --> 02:21.596
Fuck!

02:29.606 --> 02:31.039
Guard that exit there.

03:16.288 --> 03:18.256
Seal off all the fire exits!

03:18.290 --> 03:19.891
Go!

03:43.516 --> 03:45.785
- Hello?
- It's me.

03:45.819 --> 03:48.388
- Grace?
<i>- I've found him, Tommy.</i>

03:49.357 --> 03:51.191
I've found him.

03:51.225 --> 03:53.026
The man who killed our boy.

03:53.060 --> 03:54.428
What?

03:54.996 --> 03:56.330
He's a cop.

03:56.364 --> 03:58.532
What are you talking about?

03:58.566 --> 04:01.235
<i>- Grace, where are you?</i>
- His name is Fleming.

04:01.269 --> 04:04.171
All right?
And he's a detective.

04:05.741 --> 04:07.241
The cops are gonna come
to the house, Tommy.

04:07.276 --> 04:11.012
- What do you mean are gonna come...?
- Keep Evie close. You can't get isolated.

04:11.046 --> 04:13.914
<i>Just stay where there are
cops, you have witnesses.</i>

04:13.949 --> 04:15.950
<i>You understand me?</i>

04:15.984 --> 04:18.017
<i>You hear me?</i>

04:19.454 --> 04:20.754
Yeah.

04:20.789 --> 04:22.156
I hear you.

04:22.190 --> 04:23.824
Okay.

04:27.862 --> 04:29.529
Here we go.

04:34.569 --> 04:36.570
Detective Ol Parker,
San Jose PD.

04:41.877 --> 04:44.880
<i>Detective Lucas Mitchell.
Please leave a message.</i>

04:44.915 --> 04:46.949
Mitch, it's me.

04:48.318 --> 04:50.820
Call me on this number
as soon as you get this.

04:50.854 --> 04:52.288
It's urgent, buddy.

04:52.322 --> 04:54.557
You know where she is,
where she might be going?

04:54.591 --> 04:56.158
- No.
- No idea?

04:56.193 --> 04:58.193
- Dad, what's going on?
- Hey.

04:58.228 --> 04:59.695
Sweetie.

04:59.729 --> 05:01.464
Is everything okay?

05:01.498 --> 05:03.499
Yeah, yeah.

05:03.533 --> 05:05.067
- Is Mom okay?
- Mom's fine.

05:12.809 --> 05:15.310
- We lost her. - What do you mean
you lost her? She was in custody.

05:15.345 --> 05:18.413
She got herself transferred to
a hospital where she escaped.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.949
- Are you fucking kidding?
- We'll find her, trust me.

05:20.984 --> 05:22.084
Trust you?

05:26.589 --> 05:29.791
<i>San Jose Police Department.
How may I direct your call?</i>

05:29.825 --> 05:31.826
Detective Mitchell, please.

05:31.860 --> 05:33.894
<i>One moment, please.</i>

05:38.334 --> 05:40.701
<i>He's not answering.
May I take a message?</i>

05:40.736 --> 05:42.737
Uh... no.

05:42.771 --> 05:44.572
Fuck!

05:53.849 --> 05:55.850
You're looking for my mom,
right?

05:59.488 --> 06:01.089
Yes, we are.

06:03.625 --> 06:05.627
Do you know what she did?

06:07.562 --> 06:09.697
Yeah, she killed
the man who did that.

06:14.269 --> 06:16.237
Evie?

06:16.272 --> 06:19.007
Evie, thank God. I told you
to stay close to me, okay?

06:19.041 --> 06:20.442
Come on.

06:34.256 --> 06:35.657
Mitch!

06:54.311 --> 06:56.012
Maybe we should
get out of here.

06:56.046 --> 06:58.881
You know, get away from all
this shit, go someplace else.

07:00.384 --> 07:02.418
You expecting anyone?

07:02.653 --> 07:04.553
I take the morning off
to be with you.

07:04.588 --> 07:06.622
Sweetheart, would you?

07:13.296 --> 07:14.864
What do you want?

07:14.898 --> 07:16.966
Well, if it isn't my favorite
fugitive cop.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.034
Can I come in?

07:21.705 --> 07:23.505
Thank you.

07:23.540 --> 07:25.107
I need to talk.

07:25.141 --> 07:27.276
You know they suspended me,
don't you?

07:27.310 --> 07:29.311
It was only a matter of time.

07:29.346 --> 07:32.047
I make one call, turn you in,
I get my career back.

07:32.816 --> 07:35.284
So what are you gonna offer
me that's better than that?

07:37.120 --> 07:38.120
Nothing.

07:39.889 --> 07:42.290
I always admired your
negotiating skills.

07:44.460 --> 07:45.560
Alright.

07:45.594 --> 07:48.129
Sweetheart, could you maybe
give us a second?

07:48.163 --> 07:50.198
- I'll go for a smoke.
- Okay.

07:56.806 --> 07:58.773
How did you get out?

07:58.807 --> 08:00.241
Hospital.

08:00.275 --> 08:01.910
Travis, you're wasted as a cop.

08:01.944 --> 08:04.345
I can't get hold of Mitch.
Have you seen him?

08:04.379 --> 08:07.214
Yeah, I was with him
yesterday, we were working your case.

08:07.983 --> 08:09.116
You were?

08:09.151 --> 08:11.452
Actually, we made a pretty good team.
You know, he's not a bad cop.

08:11.486 --> 08:15.022
You know Max was sent down
for assaulting a cop?

08:15.523 --> 08:16.857
Yeah.

08:16.891 --> 08:18.926
Fleming was the cop.

08:20.495 --> 08:22.463
That wasn't
in the arrest report.

08:22.498 --> 08:24.565
Somebody's been burying
that shit.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.635
Mitch went out to Fleming's
to see what he could dig up.

08:28.037 --> 08:29.804
Listen to this.

08:29.838 --> 08:33.006
<i>Wilson, it's me. I'm at
Fleming's grandmother's.</i>

08:33.041 --> 08:35.976
<i>Guess who used to live across
the street. Jimmy Laszlo.</i>

08:36.010 --> 08:38.212
<i>Fleming and Max grew up
together.</i>

08:38.246 --> 08:39.806
<i>I'm gonna have a look around
the old Laszlo joint.</i>

08:39.807 --> 08:41.198
<i>I'll check it with you later.</i>

08:41.883 --> 08:43.850
We think Max's arrest
was staged.

08:43.885 --> 08:48.657
He got himself thrown in jail to give him an
alibi when the move on his father goes down.

08:49.325 --> 08:52.260
Max makes it look like Clay Street
is trying to take out Jimmy.

08:52.295 --> 08:54.563
Alec finds himself in the
middle of a war,

08:54.597 --> 08:56.632
fucks it up as only
Alec Laszlo can.

08:57.201 --> 09:00.403
Max comes out, restores
order, takes Jimmy's crown.

09:03.707 --> 09:05.708
Fleming killed Sam.

09:07.878 --> 09:09.312
What F...

09:09.347 --> 09:11.147
Fleming, you sure?

09:13.918 --> 09:17.220
Remember that meet...
where Chen didn't show?

09:19.290 --> 09:21.291
I had Sam with me.

09:22.194 --> 09:24.195
I left him in the car.

09:25.697 --> 09:28.132
I think that he saw
Fleming kill Chen.

09:31.570 --> 09:33.572
I think he was a witness.

09:36.308 --> 09:38.543
Oh, I am...
I'm so fucking sorry.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.091
We've got to find Mitch.

10:14.115 --> 10:16.116
How did you fuck this up?

10:17.718 --> 10:19.686
She got the jump on me.

10:19.721 --> 10:23.023
She's still out there, putting
this whole thing together.

10:24.693 --> 10:27.694
- This could come back to me.
- I'll deal with it.

10:27.729 --> 10:29.463
Like you dealt with
Michael Chen?

10:31.032 --> 10:33.000
It was you, wasn't it?

10:33.034 --> 10:34.802
You killed her boy.

10:35.270 --> 10:38.939
I came to you and I told you we had
a problem with the Chen situation.

10:39.541 --> 10:41.242
He was a child.

10:41.276 --> 10:43.310
Don't fucking put that on me.

10:44.312 --> 10:46.314
Don't you fucking
put that on me.

10:48.150 --> 10:52.186
I told you we had a witness, you didn't want
to know, you didn't want to hear about it.

10:52.220 --> 10:54.589
You told me to deal with it,
I dealt with it.

10:55.590 --> 10:58.625
You think I wanted to do
that, you motherfucker?

11:00.762 --> 11:03.997
You told me Wilson was gonna
show up for the meet with Chen.

11:04.032 --> 11:05.666
Well, he didn't
fucking show up!

11:06.935 --> 11:09.070
She wasn't even supposed
to be there.

11:11.006 --> 11:12.807
I didn't see him, he was
alone in the car.

11:15.177 --> 11:17.478
What the fuck was he doing
in the car alone?

11:17.512 --> 11:19.547
He was a fucking kid!

11:21.016 --> 11:23.017
I didn't know
it was a cop's kid.

11:33.028 --> 11:35.029
You fucked up, kid.

11:44.606 --> 11:46.373
You'll be dealing with me now.

11:47.508 --> 11:49.509
My father's retired.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.444
You got that?

11:51.478 --> 11:53.512
He doesn't look retired to me.

11:57.784 --> 11:58.751
Don't worry.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.853
That's taken care of.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.361
Sorry, Jimmy, Alec told us
not to let you in.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.330
Aargh!

12:11.365 --> 12:14.167
- You alright?
- You fucking shot me!

12:15.035 --> 12:16.603
Motherfucker!

12:16.637 --> 12:18.738
- Listen, Jimmy, I'm sorry.
- Lloyd.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.308
Sorry, Jimmy!

12:21.342 --> 12:22.876
The boys...

12:22.911 --> 12:25.747
I tried to tell them but
they wouldn't fucking listen.

12:25.781 --> 12:27.816
Motherfucker!

12:32.589 --> 12:34.189
Fuck them.

12:34.224 --> 12:36.592
Fuck Alec, I'll deal with him
in my own time.

12:36.626 --> 12:39.895
Right now, what I'm interested
in is Grace fucking Travis.

12:39.930 --> 12:41.564
She escaped from custody.

12:41.598 --> 12:43.566
- You're shitting me?
- I wish I was.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.601
Raise the bounty, 500,000.

12:45.635 --> 12:47.636
Get the word out.

12:47.671 --> 12:49.371
I want her dead.

12:49.405 --> 12:51.440
I'm on it, Jimmy. I'm on it.

12:56.612 --> 12:57.679
Alec.

12:57.713 --> 12:59.347
Dad.

13:03.919 --> 13:05.587
How can I help?

13:05.621 --> 13:07.622
There've been some changes
around here.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.690
I noticed.

13:14.763 --> 13:17.498
You can either leave with
your dignity intact...

13:19.234 --> 13:21.402
or my boys down there
are gonna throw you out.

13:39.588 --> 13:41.022
Alright.

14:13.423 --> 14:15.424
Want us to finish him off?

14:16.593 --> 14:17.627
No.

14:19.096 --> 14:20.796
Let him go.

14:38.547 --> 14:39.580
No.

14:40.482 --> 14:42.450
This isn't happening.

14:42.485 --> 14:44.519
What?

14:46.422 --> 14:47.789
They got him.

14:47.823 --> 14:50.958
- How do you know?
- Because everything's gone!

14:51.860 --> 14:56.630
The maps, the files-- everything that
he had on the case, it's gone.

14:58.900 --> 15:00.868
He's gone.

15:00.902 --> 15:02.904
Wilson, he's...

15:02.938 --> 15:04.972
he's dead.

15:07.309 --> 15:08.543
No!

15:10.846 --> 15:13.114
You don't know that.
We don't know that.

15:20.923 --> 15:23.258
I should have never brought
him into this.

15:24.627 --> 15:26.628
I should have left him alone.

15:28.730 --> 15:30.231
What about his boy?

15:31.033 --> 15:32.900
What about his beautiful boy?

15:32.935 --> 15:34.936
Mitch wanted to do this,
you know?

15:34.971 --> 15:38.373
He had a chance to get out and he
didn't take it. He didn't give up on you.

15:39.108 --> 15:41.109
The evil fucking bastards!

15:45.449 --> 15:47.450
Fleming didn't do this alone...

15:48.652 --> 15:51.288
come after me,
take Mitch out...

15:53.958 --> 15:55.726
clean this place up.

15:56.694 --> 15:58.295
He's not acting alone.

15:58.997 --> 16:00.063
Alright.

16:00.097 --> 16:02.098
What are you doing?

16:02.132 --> 16:04.467
He had a backup piece
somewhere here.

16:04.501 --> 16:07.103
Travis, you can't take them
all on by yourself.

16:07.137 --> 16:09.940
- What are you gonna do when you
find Fleming? Let me help. - I got it!

16:09.974 --> 16:11.975
We'll take them in together.

16:12.010 --> 16:14.878
Travis, please... come on.

16:14.913 --> 16:17.014
I need you to keep an eye
on my family.

16:18.116 --> 16:20.385
I need you to keep Fleming
away from them.

16:21.487 --> 16:23.455
It's okay, it's done.

16:23.489 --> 16:26.457
What about Jimmy? 'Cause you know
he'll be coming after you.

16:31.030 --> 16:32.997
You know as well as I do.

16:33.032 --> 16:35.867
If my son Alec takes over...

16:38.203 --> 16:40.204
there'll be a bloodbath.

16:41.373 --> 16:43.274
We all lose.

16:43.308 --> 16:46.611
You've wanted in on the docks
for a long time, we know that.

16:48.247 --> 16:50.314
I'm prepared to give you
an opening.

16:51.650 --> 16:53.651
Partnership.

17:01.660 --> 17:03.660
What I need right now
is muscle.

17:04.996 --> 17:06.997
Do we have an agreement?

17:49.474 --> 17:52.175
How many? 22?

17:53.144 --> 17:55.345
I'll have to get
some more guys on that.

17:58.249 --> 17:59.849
Alright.

18:10.795 --> 18:12.562
What am I doing here, Dad?

18:14.665 --> 18:16.032
Sit down.

18:16.833 --> 18:18.567
I'm not gonna sit down.

18:18.601 --> 18:21.036
Sit down.
I want to talk to you.

18:21.071 --> 18:22.938
There's nothing to talk about.

18:25.141 --> 18:27.176
We can sort this out, Alec.

18:27.210 --> 18:28.877
It's not too late.

18:37.086 --> 18:39.087
What did I tell you
about making me wait?

18:39.489 --> 18:40.756
Agh!

18:46.595 --> 18:48.763
Relax. Think I'm gonna
try something?

18:48.798 --> 18:50.198
You're my only son.

18:50.233 --> 18:52.268
Now, sit down.

18:52.936 --> 18:55.238
Give me half an hour
of your precious time.

19:09.853 --> 19:10.920
Urgh!

19:10.954 --> 19:12.121
Hey!

19:15.058 --> 19:17.059
I could have had you taken out.

19:17.894 --> 19:19.561
Back there.

19:19.595 --> 19:20.962
At the office.

19:20.997 --> 19:22.164
Urgh!

19:24.067 --> 19:26.034
All I had to do...

19:26.069 --> 19:28.103
say the word.

19:30.273 --> 19:32.207
I spared your life.

19:33.843 --> 19:35.310
Well, I'm touched.

20:10.144 --> 20:12.713
Well, wanna go...

20:13.481 --> 20:15.649
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

21:00.229 --> 21:01.763
Grandma Esther.

21:01.797 --> 21:03.531
Hello.

21:08.872 --> 21:12.942
James Laszlo.
The man. The legend.

21:14.578 --> 21:16.479
So word out in the street is
these are your new offices.

21:16.513 --> 21:19.782
Only temporary, Detective...?

21:19.817 --> 21:21.151
Wilson.

21:22.253 --> 21:24.254
Wilson.

21:28.625 --> 21:31.293
- I gotta congratulate you.
- Oh?

21:31.327 --> 21:33.529
Grace Travis.

21:38.935 --> 21:42.405
Yeah, I mean damn, I've been
trying to bang that broad

21:42.439 --> 21:44.607
since the day she walked
into Oakland.

21:44.641 --> 21:48.278
No luck. You? She just jumps
right in the sack with you.

21:48.312 --> 21:50.880
But then what do you got
that I don't?

21:50.915 --> 21:53.583
Is it the power, the money,
the beard?

21:54.585 --> 21:57.954
It's all right. I get it. What I don't
get is why you're going after her.

21:57.989 --> 22:01.158
What's the bounty now?
100,000? 200?

22:01.192 --> 22:04.528
Look, I know she killed your boy,
but it was self-defense, Jimmy.

22:04.562 --> 22:09.065
All she ever did was try and find the
bastard who put a bullet in her son's head.

22:09.100 --> 22:10.834
You're going after
the wrong person.

22:10.868 --> 22:13.103
It's Fleming you want.
Detective Fleming, Oakland PD.

22:13.137 --> 22:15.505
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

22:15.540 --> 22:17.608
Maybe you do, maybe you don't.

22:18.610 --> 22:20.878
He was a friend
of your boy Max.

22:20.913 --> 22:25.117
They grew up together, right across the
street from your old Jackson Street house.

22:25.151 --> 22:27.319
Maybe they were more
than just friends.

22:27.354 --> 22:30.456
Cos those two did
every fucking thing together.

22:32.025 --> 22:35.461
That bastard, he shot at you,
killed Tony Aldon,

22:35.495 --> 22:37.329
murdered your dear friend
Charlie.

22:37.363 --> 22:40.132
That's the bastard you want,
not Grace.

22:40.166 --> 22:42.534
You need to think about
who your real enemy is here,

22:42.569 --> 22:44.303
cos it ain't her.

23:48.999 --> 23:50.800
Jimmy don't want you here.

24:00.078 --> 24:02.479
You slitty-eyed pricks.

24:03.981 --> 24:06.049
I'm coming back.

24:06.084 --> 24:07.517
And heavy.

24:07.552 --> 24:10.887
You better believe
I'm coming back.

24:15.059 --> 24:16.960
Jimmy brought the chinks
onto the docks?

24:16.994 --> 24:20.430
They're sitting there
right now, at my desk...

24:21.432 --> 24:22.733
Charlie's, Max's.

24:22.767 --> 24:24.734
How could he fucking do this?

24:24.769 --> 24:26.670
So got my guys.
Every one of them.

24:26.704 --> 24:28.939
All of them fucking gone.

24:33.211 --> 24:36.547
He's got no crew left so he
makes a deal with Clay Street.

24:38.883 --> 24:40.918
He's lost his fucking soul.

24:43.522 --> 24:46.123
- What are you gonna do?
- What do you think I'm gonna do?

24:46.157 --> 24:48.325
Lie down and take it?

24:48.359 --> 24:51.295
No. Not this time.

24:51.329 --> 24:55.098
Baby, he's not gonna stop.

24:55.132 --> 24:57.200
I'm not afraid of him any more.

24:58.803 --> 25:00.837
He wants a war...

25:05.575 --> 25:07.710
I'm gonna give him one.

25:11.814 --> 25:13.381
You need to think about this.

25:13.415 --> 25:15.684
I have thought about it.

25:15.718 --> 25:17.519
I've thought about
nothing else.

25:17.553 --> 25:20.255
You can still talk to him.
You can still sort it out.

25:20.289 --> 25:22.124
Talk to him?

25:22.158 --> 25:24.125
Jesus, Cath,
whose side are you on?

25:24.160 --> 25:26.128
I don't want Ruby
losing her daddy.

25:26.162 --> 25:27.796
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

25:27.830 --> 25:30.666
I'm just saying
we need to tread carefully.

25:30.700 --> 25:32.835
You think I'm not up for this?

25:32.869 --> 25:35.771
This is what you've wanted for years
and now you're getting cold feet!

25:35.805 --> 25:39.141
- I am not... - If you don't have the
stomach for it, maybe you should leave!

25:41.177 --> 25:44.680
How can you say that to me?
Is that what you want?

25:44.715 --> 25:47.983
What I want is a wife
who is gonna stand by me,

25:48.017 --> 25:51.187
not run up the white flag
the minute things get tough.

25:51.221 --> 25:54.156
Now, if you can't do that,
why don't you fuck off?

25:54.758 --> 25:57.059
Fine! Maybe I'll do that!

25:57.094 --> 25:59.295
Why don't I get my things?
Ruby!

26:00.364 --> 26:01.998
Ruby is not going anywhere.

26:02.032 --> 26:04.033
You wanna go, go!

26:04.067 --> 26:06.202
She stays here.

26:07.738 --> 26:09.406
You're hurting me.

26:10.408 --> 26:13.343
- What is it, Mommy?
- Come here, baby.

26:13.378 --> 26:15.012
Come here.

26:28.726 --> 26:30.093
Keep looking.

26:30.127 --> 26:32.229
Got a guy in that apartment
of hers.

26:32.263 --> 26:34.065
Got someone on her family home.

26:34.099 --> 26:37.468
We put someone on Wilson.
He hasn't been anywhere near her.

26:37.502 --> 26:38.903
She's a fucking ghost.

26:38.937 --> 26:42.073
I don't care what it costs,
fucking find her.

26:42.108 --> 26:44.709
Jimmy! Jimmy!

26:55.122 --> 26:57.724
Detective Fleming, right?

26:59.293 --> 27:02.162
You got balls coming here.
I'll give you that.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.666
Give us a minute, huh?

27:21.251 --> 27:23.152
Nervous?

27:24.288 --> 27:25.589
Yeah.

27:26.090 --> 27:29.626
If I wanted to take you out, you wouldn't have
reached the fucking door. What do you want?

27:29.661 --> 27:31.695
I know where Max
put your money.

27:32.730 --> 27:34.365
25 million.

27:35.333 --> 27:36.900
Go on.

27:36.935 --> 27:40.704
It's in an offshore account.
I can't get to it but...

27:40.738 --> 27:43.174
you're next of kin, so you can.

27:44.142 --> 27:46.210
If I tell you where it is.

27:46.245 --> 27:48.279
I'm listening.

27:49.414 --> 27:51.582
You want Grace Travis?

27:51.616 --> 27:53.450
I can give you that bitch
on a plate.

27:53.485 --> 27:55.486
- How?
- She wants me.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.688
- I can flush her out.
- And in return?

27:58.523 --> 28:00.658
- I want a slice of the cake.
- How much?

28:00.692 --> 28:02.560
Five million.

28:03.595 --> 28:06.464
Or you could kill me...
and get no money...

28:07.499 --> 28:09.500
and no Grace.

28:13.805 --> 28:15.573
Are you the one who shot at me?

28:15.607 --> 28:17.275
Yeah.

28:17.309 --> 28:19.243
And Charlie, Tony?

28:20.813 --> 28:23.548
I did whatever Max
told me to do.

28:23.582 --> 28:25.650
If I didn't,
I'd be the one on the slab.

28:25.684 --> 28:29.253
And that fucking cop's
little boy? Sam?

28:32.024 --> 28:33.825
I never wanted to do that one.

28:34.793 --> 28:36.794
I never wanted to do it.

28:39.532 --> 28:41.532
Was that Max?

28:43.802 --> 28:46.037
No.

28:46.072 --> 28:48.773
Max didn't know
anything about it.

28:48.807 --> 28:51.009
That was Campbell.

28:52.779 --> 28:55.214
Deputy Chief Campbell?

28:57.083 --> 28:58.584
Hey!

28:58.618 --> 29:02.221
You wanna deal with me, you tell me
the truth, every fucking word of it!

29:05.159 --> 29:08.895
What? You think Max could've
moved against you on his own, man?

29:10.064 --> 29:11.532
Campbell was
his ace in the hole.

29:11.566 --> 29:14.902
I don't understand. Who did you work for?
Max or Campbell?

29:17.305 --> 29:19.974
It was Max's idea
I become a cop.

29:20.008 --> 29:23.578
We were gonna run Oakland one day,
just like you and Campbell.

29:26.115 --> 29:29.050
Campbell found out
that I was working with Max,

29:29.084 --> 29:32.453
he threatened to expose me
unless I... did his bidding.

29:33.588 --> 29:36.423
With me on the inside,
he could control Max.

29:37.759 --> 29:39.893
Max had no idea.

29:40.995 --> 29:43.130
You were his friend.

29:45.366 --> 29:48.201
Campbell had it in his head
that you uh...

29:49.202 --> 29:50.769
you were a lost cause.

29:52.105 --> 29:54.740
They were already planning
to move against you when...

29:54.774 --> 29:57.175
Campbell found out
about the 25 million.

29:57.210 --> 29:59.678
- How?
- From a Fed named Michael Chen.

30:00.613 --> 30:03.515
Chen was investigating
money-laundering in the Bay

30:03.549 --> 30:06.484
when he stumbled across
one of Tony's paper trails.

30:06.519 --> 30:09.354
How did Max steal my money?

30:10.389 --> 30:12.590
He didn't.

30:12.624 --> 30:16.327
Your accountant, Tony Aldon,
he stole it.

30:19.097 --> 30:21.098
He got greedy.

30:21.933 --> 30:24.801
Campbell found out about
the money, he told your son,

30:24.836 --> 30:27.804
they agreed to split it,

30:27.838 --> 30:30.673
Max blackmailed Tony,
I shot him.

30:39.416 --> 30:41.518
And Michael Chen?

30:41.552 --> 30:45.255
Campbell was worried Chen would
uncover the links between you and him,

30:45.289 --> 30:46.856
so Chen had to go.

30:47.859 --> 30:50.026
That was your handiwork?

30:52.129 --> 30:54.331
Chen was undercover so uh...

30:54.365 --> 30:56.600
we had no idea
how to find him so...

30:57.568 --> 31:00.337
Campbell had Wilson
arrange a meet to get him in the open.

31:00.371 --> 31:03.340
- Wilson was in on this?
- No.

31:03.374 --> 31:05.708
Wilson's a fucking patsy.

31:06.443 --> 31:08.778
Anyway, Wilson didn't show.

31:08.813 --> 31:10.914
Grace Travis did.

31:10.948 --> 31:13.616
And her little boy
saw you kill Chen?

31:15.886 --> 31:17.887
Yeah.

31:22.359 --> 31:24.694
I remember you now.

31:24.728 --> 31:27.163
From the Jackson Street house.

31:27.197 --> 31:29.699
Alec used to beat the shit
out of you.

31:33.569 --> 31:35.604
Alec...

31:37.039 --> 31:40.341
Alec bullied me and Max
every opportunity he got.

31:41.076 --> 31:43.711
Yeah.
That's how we became friends.

31:47.782 --> 31:49.750
Why did he hate me?

31:50.785 --> 31:53.453
Max didn't hate you, Jimmy.

31:53.488 --> 31:55.722
You were in his way.
That's all.

31:56.758 --> 31:58.859
Max didn't have feelings
for anyone.

31:58.893 --> 32:01.027
Except for you?

32:02.964 --> 32:06.033
A bond that strong,
over that many years.

32:07.802 --> 32:09.803
Were you two love...

32:20.847 --> 32:23.582
Do we have a deal or what?
Hm?

32:26.052 --> 32:28.087
Tell me...

32:29.089 --> 32:33.558
How does it feel to put a bullet in
the head of a seven-year-old boy?

32:36.429 --> 32:39.097
Oh, I'm gonna burn in hell.
I know that.

32:39.131 --> 32:41.800
I just ain't going there yet.
That's all.

32:49.508 --> 32:51.809
You deliver Grace Travis...

32:52.611 --> 32:55.246
after I'm done with her...

32:55.281 --> 32:57.815
you take me to the money.

32:57.850 --> 33:00.051
I'll give you 500,000.

33:00.086 --> 33:02.754
Not a cent more.

33:04.190 --> 33:05.857
Okay.

33:07.860 --> 33:10.462
Wilson's in touch with Travis.

33:11.964 --> 33:14.233
Appreciate the tip.

33:52.641 --> 33:54.174
- Yeah?
<i>- It's me.</i>

33:55.043 --> 33:57.711
Fleming's here.
He's outside your house.

33:59.914 --> 34:01.515
Oh, God.

34:01.549 --> 34:04.184
- He's going in.
- You need to get in there.

34:04.218 --> 34:06.186
Don't leave them alone
with him.

34:06.220 --> 34:08.353
Yeah, I'm gone.

34:22.338 --> 34:23.905
- What the fuck?
- Okay, stop.

34:23.938 --> 34:25.473
No, no.

34:25.674 --> 34:29.243
Buddy Wilson, I am arresting you on
suspicion of aiding and abetting a fugitive.

34:29.277 --> 34:31.344
- What are you talking about?
- Do not resist! I'm warning you.

34:31.380 --> 34:34.715
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you do or say can...

34:34.750 --> 34:37.385
That man is dangerous!
Do not let him in that house!

34:37.418 --> 34:39.353
If you cannot afford an attorney
one will be provided for you.

34:39.387 --> 34:42.523
He killed Sam Travis!
He killed Detective Travis's son!

34:42.556 --> 34:44.891
- Do not let him in...
- Do you understand the rights...?

34:44.926 --> 34:46.694
You're making a mistake!

34:46.728 --> 34:48.362
Get him out of here!

34:51.065 --> 34:53.733
- What the hell is all that?
- No idea.

35:06.112 --> 35:07.212
Hello?

35:12.218 --> 35:14.419
- Hello?
<i>- Tom.</i>

35:15.021 --> 35:16.788
Grace.

35:16.822 --> 35:19.091
- Yeah. Look there.
- Got it.

35:22.729 --> 35:24.129
Are you okay?

35:26.499 --> 35:27.799
Yeah, I'm fine.

35:27.834 --> 35:29.468
Is Evie with you?

35:30.303 --> 35:32.304
She's fine.

35:34.341 --> 35:36.109
The police are here, too,
Grace.

35:39.180 --> 35:40.914
<i>Tell her to pick up
the extension.</i>

35:42.784 --> 35:44.652
Look, I don't think
that's a good idea.

35:44.686 --> 35:47.722
<i>Please, just... just do it
for me, Tommy.</i>

35:47.756 --> 35:49.290
<i>Will you?</i>

35:49.325 --> 35:51.626
Honey, pick up the other phone.

35:55.097 --> 35:56.097
Mom?

35:56.131 --> 35:58.166
<i>Are you okay?</i>

35:59.401 --> 36:01.069
I'm fine, baby.

36:01.103 --> 36:03.104
<i>How about you?</i>

36:03.139 --> 36:04.639
I'm okay.

36:05.708 --> 36:07.743
I love you, Mom.

36:09.078 --> 36:11.780
I love you so much.

36:12.515 --> 36:15.451
I always have
and I always will.

36:17.688 --> 36:19.922
<i>Tommy, they're onto me.</i>

36:20.758 --> 36:23.459
I'm going to Grandma Esther's
to say goodbye.

36:30.535 --> 36:31.535
Yeah.

36:32.937 --> 36:35.171
<i>Yeah. I think she'd like that.</i>

36:37.875 --> 36:39.575
I love you.

36:41.411 --> 36:43.712
We got her!
We got her position.

36:43.747 --> 36:46.382
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

36:47.584 --> 36:49.852
- Dad...
- Yeah.

36:50.754 --> 36:52.754
It's okay.

36:52.789 --> 36:54.990
- Who's Grandma Esther?
- I have no idea.

36:55.024 --> 36:57.559
Grandma.
Grandma, are you there?

36:58.461 --> 37:00.328
Come on, pick up.

37:00.362 --> 37:02.897
Call me back as soon as you get this
and let me know you're okay.

37:20.917 --> 37:22.084
Shit!

37:46.609 --> 37:48.611
Grandma?

37:54.785 --> 37:56.787
Grandma?

38:02.961 --> 38:04.462
Why didn't you answer
the phone?

38:04.496 --> 38:07.098
Nicky.
What are you doing here?

38:09.936 --> 38:13.772
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd pop by. Everything okay?

38:13.806 --> 38:17.042
- Someone stopped by for you.
- What?

38:17.076 --> 38:19.478
Another cop asking
about poor Max Laszlo.

38:19.512 --> 38:21.513
Pretty young black girl.

38:21.547 --> 38:25.451
- Did you see where she went?
- She went to the old Laszlo house.

38:25.485 --> 38:27.686
Lord knows what she thinks
she's gonna find in there.

39:08.165 --> 39:11.501
Just slowly and carefully
drop your gun.

39:16.607 --> 39:18.708
Do it.

39:25.916 --> 39:27.350
Now move.

39:29.187 --> 39:31.454
That's it.

39:41.032 --> 39:43.166
That for me?

39:44.702 --> 39:47.037
Okay, you need to get
down on your knees.

39:49.340 --> 39:52.575
I'm a cop. You know
what they do to cop-killers.

39:52.610 --> 39:54.377
On your knees.

39:59.650 --> 40:01.384
We can talk about this, sister.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.854
Put your hands
behind your back.

40:04.889 --> 40:07.190
Are you gonna fucking
torture me, Travis?

40:07.225 --> 40:09.292
Do it.

40:14.933 --> 40:17.467
Grace.

40:24.843 --> 40:27.077
Did you really think
I'd come here alone?

40:27.879 --> 40:29.413
Huh?

40:33.219 --> 40:34.619
Drop it.

40:37.490 --> 40:39.657
Drop it!

40:51.470 --> 40:53.337
All yours, Jimmy.

40:56.942 --> 40:59.177
I'll be outside.

41:06.118 --> 41:08.419
What are you doing, Jimmy?

41:08.454 --> 41:10.355
What are you doing, man?

41:11.624 --> 41:14.525
Think about it.
Without me, there's no money.

41:16.295 --> 41:17.896
I delivered her.
We had a deal.

41:17.930 --> 41:20.165
Come on, man.

41:21.801 --> 41:23.668
Come on.

41:24.470 --> 41:26.804
I just need to know...

41:29.508 --> 41:31.576
My Sam.

41:33.912 --> 41:37.482
He saw you kill Michael Chen,
didn't he?

41:39.551 --> 41:41.952
I just need to hear it
from you.

41:44.823 --> 41:47.124
And that is all.

41:50.128 --> 41:52.196
Why did you leave a kid
alone in a car?

42:16.920 --> 42:18.921
Was it worth it?

44:02.058 --> 44:04.159
Grace.

44:06.395 --> 44:08.396
What happened?

44:15.170 --> 44:17.204
I got him.

44:20.309 --> 44:22.443
I got him, Tommy.

44:27.850 --> 44:29.950
It's over.

44:33.388 --> 44:35.556
It's over.

44:48.338 --> 44:49.839
- Mom?
- Hey.

44:53.778 --> 44:56.246
What are you doing home?

44:58.383 --> 45:00.350
I came home.

45:00.385 --> 45:02.552
Are the police
still looking for you?

45:03.855 --> 45:06.256
Yes.

45:07.058 --> 45:09.058
What happens now?

45:10.728 --> 45:13.129
Come here. Come here.

45:15.365 --> 45:18.601
When you were little,
and I used to read to you,

45:19.703 --> 45:22.739
you'd always say,
"What happens next?"

45:22.773 --> 45:25.141
"What happens next, Mommy?"

45:27.845 --> 45:29.680
Even on the last page.

45:29.714 --> 45:34.284
You know, the part where it's,
"And they all lived happily ever after."

45:38.456 --> 45:40.690
That was never enough for you.

45:42.026 --> 45:44.160
My smart little bean.

45:46.563 --> 45:48.764
You always had to know more.

45:49.599 --> 45:51.734
"What happens next, Mommy?"

45:54.705 --> 45:56.739
"What happens next?"

47:02.704 --> 47:04.839
Let's go.

47:46.914 --> 47:48.815
You remember when we first met?

47:51.252 --> 47:54.221
You'd pulled me over on a DUI,

47:54.255 --> 47:56.356
in your bright, shiny uniform.

47:56.391 --> 48:00.461
What were you? 25?

48:00.495 --> 48:01.729
26.

48:01.763 --> 48:04.098
I can see it in your eyes.

48:04.133 --> 48:06.501
We wanted the same things.

48:06.535 --> 48:09.037
- I let you off.
- You did.

48:09.071 --> 48:11.406
We built an empire together.

48:13.976 --> 48:16.878
So why'd you fucking betray me?

48:22.852 --> 48:26.388
You thought you could hide 25 million
and I wouldn't find out?

48:28.992 --> 48:31.594
Thought you could buy a bank
without me?

48:31.628 --> 48:33.896
Go legit?

48:35.933 --> 48:37.801
I made you, Jimmy.

48:40.738 --> 48:43.173
Heard about your deal
with Clay Street.

48:43.975 --> 48:47.377
- Ingenious.
- Yeah, well... needs must.

48:47.412 --> 48:50.647
I'm not gonna let the Chinese
get a hold on the docks, Jimmy.

48:50.682 --> 48:52.916
It's not in my game plan.

48:52.951 --> 48:55.152
Well, they work for me,
you know.

48:56.154 --> 48:58.522
I'm still in charge down there.

49:00.125 --> 49:02.860
You wanna try and run
things by yourself?

49:02.894 --> 49:06.030
You go right ahead.
See how that works for you.

49:06.865 --> 49:10.067
I'll shut you down within a month, Jimmy.
You know that.

49:12.438 --> 49:15.506
I want you gone...
out of Oakland.

49:20.646 --> 49:22.914
That's not gonna happen.

49:25.885 --> 49:29.321
Then I'm gonna go after Alec
for those heads.

49:29.355 --> 49:32.357
I'll push for Murder One.
That's death row, Jimmy.

49:33.426 --> 49:35.827
You know I'll get it.

49:36.963 --> 49:39.164
It's either you or him.

49:44.536 --> 49:47.238
If I agree to leave...

49:47.272 --> 49:49.340
you leave Alec alone.

49:50.376 --> 49:52.477
He runs things.

49:56.148 --> 49:57.849
I don't have a problem
with that.

49:57.883 --> 50:00.551
But he doesn't get to know
about this.

50:02.521 --> 50:04.689
Let him...

50:06.324 --> 50:09.160
Let him think
he got there on his own.

51:00.311 --> 51:02.746
I told 'em
I was coming back heavy.

51:04.348 --> 51:06.516
Looks like
they got the message.

52:22.626 --> 52:24.761
There are two ways this can go.

52:29.566 --> 52:32.034
I can charge you
on two counts of murder...

52:34.704 --> 52:36.704
Or?

52:38.908 --> 52:42.143
As far as I'm concerned,
Detective...

52:43.846 --> 52:46.113
the department
owes you an apology.

52:52.486 --> 52:55.055
In pursuing
Detective Fleming...

52:55.089 --> 53:00.827
you took down a lone rogue cop who brought
disgrace on our badge and on our city.

53:01.896 --> 53:04.597
In a lot of people's minds
you'll be a hero.

53:04.631 --> 53:07.500
You'll have their sympathy.

53:07.535 --> 53:09.869
There'll be a review board,
of course.

53:09.904 --> 53:13.873
If the shootings are found to be
justified, you'll be in the clear.

53:19.679 --> 53:21.913
Why would you do this?

53:24.283 --> 53:27.985
The city of Oakland could use
a cop like you, Detective.

53:29.521 --> 53:31.522
Frankly, so could I.

53:33.191 --> 53:35.759
I'd like you to consider
joining my team.

53:41.768 --> 53:43.668
What do you say?

53:56.984 --> 53:59.051
Okay.

54:01.221 --> 54:03.322
I'm in.
