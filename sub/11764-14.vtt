WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:04.004
YOU FEEL KINDA SAD ABOUT
SELLING YOUR PLACE, BABE?

00:04.004 --> 00:06.037
YEAH, BUT WE'RE GETTING
MARRIED IN FOUR MONTHS.

00:06.037 --> 00:09.009
(sighs) WE PROBABLY HAVE
TO LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.681
WELL, I'M EXCITED
YOU'RE EXCITED.

00:10.681 --> 00:13.684
STILL, THIS PLACE WAS LIKE
MY ISLAND HIDEAWAY.

00:13.684 --> 00:16.187
WITH ALL THE CHAOS
AND THE WEDDING STUFF,

00:16.187 --> 00:17.518
IT'S TOUGH TO LET IT GO.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.689
SPEAKING OF WEDDING STUFF,

00:18.689 --> 00:21.352
I CUT DOWN OUR GUEST LIST
TO 80 PEOPLE,

00:21.352 --> 00:23.294
GIVE OR TAKE 61.
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU

00:23.294 --> 00:26.197
NEEDING SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND
ALL THE TIME?

00:26.197 --> 00:28.199
THIS LAST MONTH
LIVING WITH YOU--

00:28.199 --> 00:31.202
YOUR HOUSE IS NEVER NOT
FULL OF HUMANITY.

00:31.202 --> 00:33.134
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.635
HEY.
THERE THEY ARE.

00:34.635 --> 00:35.736
HEY.
HEY.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.168
IN CASE ANYONE'S WONDERING,

00:37.168 --> 00:38.709
IT'S 6:30 IN THE MORNING.

00:38.709 --> 00:41.472
WELL, I'M SURE THEY ALL HAVE
GOOD REASONS FOR BEING HERE.

00:41.472 --> 00:42.743
NOPE.
COFFEE.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.675
I WAS TRYING TO HIDE
FROM THAT ONE, BUT HE FOUND ME.

00:44.675 --> 00:46.217
MM-HMM.

00:46.217 --> 00:49.220
WELL, YOU CAN'T BE MAD AT ME
FOR THIS. (chuckles)

00:49.220 --> 00:51.222
OKAY, HE'S GONNA START
LOCKING THE DOORS,

00:51.222 --> 00:53.084
SO DO WE ALL HAVE
THOSE KEY NECKLACES

00:53.084 --> 00:54.185
THAT I MADE FOR YOU?

00:54.185 --> 00:56.157
(door closes)
OHH. GREAT. (chuckles) OKAY.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.728
(lowered voice) I'LL SEE YOU
EVERY DAY FOREVER!

00:57.728 --> 00:58.729
(Andy and Ellie chuckle)

00:58.729 --> 01:03.834
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:03.834 --> 01:05.296
HEY, JULES.

01:05.296 --> 01:08.399
UH, CAN I BORROW YOUR LADDER?
I THREW MY FRISBEE ON THE ROOF.

01:08.399 --> 01:09.700
SURE. WHO ARE YOU PLAYING
FRISBEE WITH?

01:09.700 --> 01:11.472
IT'S JUST ME. (chuckles)

01:11.472 --> 01:14.105
THAT'S THE SADDEST THING
EVER SAID.

01:14.105 --> 01:15.746
AS YOUR CO-MAID OF HONOR,

01:15.746 --> 01:19.110
I HAVE BEEN OBSESSING ABOUT
YOUR BACHELORETTE PARTY.

01:19.110 --> 01:20.611
THERE IS
THIS QUAINT LITTLE STRIP CLUB

01:20.611 --> 01:23.254
IN TAMPA CALLED THE STUD FARM.

01:23.254 --> 01:24.655
IT LOOKS LIKE A STABLE.

01:24.655 --> 01:26.487
ALL THE SNACKS COME
IN THESE LITTLE FEED BAGS...

01:26.487 --> 01:28.559
(mouths words)
AND FOR A COUPLE EXTRA BUCKS,

01:28.559 --> 01:30.761
YOU CAN RIDE THE GUYS AROUND
LIKE HORSES,

01:30.761 --> 01:33.694
AND THEY WILL NIBBLE SUGAR CUBES
OFF OF YOUR BOUNCIES.

01:33.694 --> 01:34.825
(mouths word)
OH.

01:34.825 --> 01:36.297
I KNOW THAT PLACE.

01:36.297 --> 01:39.800
YOU DO?
NO, 'CAUSE I WASN'T ABUSED
AS A CHILD.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.602
WH--
YOU GUYS ARE HERE AGAIN...

01:41.602 --> 01:43.704
(chuckles)
IN OUR KITCHEN, IN THOSE SEATS?

01:43.704 --> 01:45.176
THAT'S... (laughs)

01:45.176 --> 01:47.138
MY LIFE IS "GROUNDHOG DAY."

01:47.138 --> 01:48.239
I KNOW IT IS
YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE,

01:48.239 --> 01:51.812
BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN IT,
SO NO SPOILERS.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.314
(lowered voice)
I HAVE SEEN IT SIX TIMES,

01:53.314 --> 01:55.115
AND I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT I SAW.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.116
NO?
OH, THAT'S WHAT
I WANT TO DO

01:56.116 --> 01:57.648
FOR MY BACHELORETTE PARTY--

01:57.648 --> 01:59.720
A TIARA, AND WE WATCH
"GROUNDHOG DAY,"

01:59.720 --> 02:02.223
AND YOU GUYS CAN EXPLAIN IT
TO ME.

02:02.223 --> 02:06.157
OH, MY GOD. IT'S GONNA BE
THE LONGEST PARTY IN THE WORLD.

02:07.628 --> 02:08.759
(clanks)
(Bobby, high-pitched voice) OH!

02:08.759 --> 02:10.561
(all, singsongy) PENNY CAN!

02:10.561 --> 02:12.203
(normal voice) CAN YOU THINK
OF ANYTHING BETTER TO DO

02:12.203 --> 02:14.765
THAN AN ALL-DAY ROUND
OF PENNY CAN?

02:14.765 --> 02:16.637
NOT ENOUGH TIME IN MY LIFE
TO ANSWER THAT.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.239
UH...
(high-pitched voice) AH!

02:18.239 --> 02:19.310
(clatters)
OOH!

02:19.310 --> 02:20.771
THAT WENT RIGHT
INTO THAT SEWER GRATE.

02:20.771 --> 02:22.473
I THINK THERE'S A NEW RULE
FOR THAT. ANDY, GET THE BOOK.

02:22.473 --> 02:23.574
(Andy and Bobby laugh)

02:23.574 --> 02:24.715
YOU MADE A BOOK?

02:24.715 --> 02:26.417
IT'S MORE LIKE A BIBLE, SON.

02:26.417 --> 02:28.819
ALL RIGHT.
"SEWER... SEWER RATS...

02:28.819 --> 02:30.651
SEWER PEOPLE..."
HERE IT IS.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.483
OH! HE'S GOTTA EAT SOMETHING
FROM THE MYSTERY BUCKET.

02:32.483 --> 02:35.286
OOH! (laughs)
MYSTERY BUCKET.

02:35.286 --> 02:37.258
WHOO-HOO! ALL RIGHT.
CLOSE YOUR EYES AND PRAY.

02:37.258 --> 02:40.291
OKAY, WELL, IS EVERYTHING
AT LEAST FOOD?

02:40.291 --> 02:41.732
WELL, IF I TOLD YOU THAT NOW,

02:41.732 --> 02:42.733
IT WOULDN'T BE A MYSTERY,
WOULD IT?

02:42.733 --> 02:45.336
DADDY, CAN I THROW
A PENNY?

02:45.336 --> 02:47.298
SORRY, STAN.
THIS GAME'S FOR GROWN-UPS.

02:47.298 --> 02:48.669
(pennies clank)

02:48.669 --> 02:50.301
OOH, HE GOT THE SNAIL!
(high-pitched voice) OOH!

02:50.301 --> 02:51.302
HE GOT THE SNAIL!
(laughs, high-pitched voice)
HE'S GOT THE SNAIL!

02:51.302 --> 02:53.244
HE GOT THE SNAIL!
GOT THE SNAIL!

02:53.244 --> 02:55.646
(Andy and Bobby) GOT THE SNAIL!
GOT THE SNAIL! GOT THE SNAIL!
PENNY CAN.

02:55.646 --> 02:56.777
WELL, CAN YOU BELIEVE

02:56.777 --> 03:00.180
JELLY BEAN'S STUPID
STRIP CLUB IDEA?

03:00.180 --> 03:03.314
I SO WANT TO TELL HER
THAT I AM THE REAL MAID OF HONOR

03:03.314 --> 03:05.256
AND YOU ONLY MADE HER ONE
OUT OF PITY.

03:05.256 --> 03:08.459
I'VE HAD THAT GRENADE
IN MY BELT FOR MONTHS.

03:08.459 --> 03:10.221
(imitates click)

03:10.221 --> 03:13.324
SOMETIMES AT NIGHT,
IT WHISPERS TO ME. (gasps)

03:13.324 --> 03:16.327
(whispers) "PULL THE PIN.
KILL THEM ALL."

03:16.327 --> 03:18.299
JUST IGNORE THE VOICES
AND LOTION UP.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.601
(chuckles) WHAT ARE YOU DOING
UP HERE READING A BOOK?

03:20.601 --> 03:21.932
READING A BOOK.

03:21.932 --> 03:24.475
NERD ALERT. (chuckles)
SCOOTCH. (whispers) COME ON.

03:24.475 --> 03:25.476
(grunts)

03:25.476 --> 03:27.207
DOUBLE SCOOTCH.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.379
OH, MY GOODNESS.
LOOK AT THESE ELBOWS.
(grunts)

03:28.379 --> 03:30.811
(chuckles) LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE ELSE COULD USE SOME.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.943
THERE YOU GUYS ARE!

03:32.943 --> 03:33.944
LOTION PARTY.

03:33.944 --> 03:35.716
SWEET! SQUIRT ME IN.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.318
HERE YOU GO.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.289
MM.
THANKS.

03:38.289 --> 03:40.651
PLEASE STOP.
I DON'T WANT THIS.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.256
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

03:45.256 --> 03:46.827
WHY ARE YOU ALL TOUCHING
MY STUFF? (chuckles)

03:46.827 --> 03:48.829
PENNY CAN, BROTHER.
ANDY GOT A DOUBLE-BOUNCER.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.731
THAT MEANS
HE'S GOTTA DRESS LIKE YOU.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.363
(chuckles) TRAV, YOU OKAY?

03:52.363 --> 03:54.004
(strained voice)
I ATE A SNAIL.

03:54.004 --> 03:56.667
LOOKS LIKE V-NECKS ARE
ALL THE RAGE IN DOUCHE-BERG.

03:56.667 --> 03:57.868
(all laugh)

03:57.868 --> 03:59.270
(imitates dance beat)
STOP. STOP. STOP.

03:59.270 --> 04:00.541
EVERYBODY STOP TALKING!

04:00.541 --> 04:03.274
OKAY, THIS IS MY ROOM.
THIS IS MY BED.

04:03.274 --> 04:04.645
I'M READING A BOOK...
(chuckles)

04:04.645 --> 04:06.347
BECAUSE I LIKE READING!

04:06.347 --> 04:08.949
BUT, SEE, I CAN'T READ
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS HERE!

04:08.949 --> 04:11.482
(gasps)
WHAT IS THAT AROUND YOUR NECK?

04:13.354 --> 04:15.356
(key jangles)
WHAT'S THIS KEY OPEN?

04:15.356 --> 04:16.357
UM, A LOCK.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.758
DOES IT OPEN THIS HOUSE?

04:17.758 --> 04:19.390
UM...

04:19.390 --> 04:20.591
THEY HAVE ONE, TOO!

04:20.591 --> 04:21.632
YOU FOOL!

04:21.632 --> 04:23.864
WHAT? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

04:23.864 --> 04:25.896
THIS IS NOT OKAY!

04:25.896 --> 04:30.901
THIS IS... NOT... OKAY!

04:32.303 --> 04:33.974
(high-pitched voice) AAH.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.507
SO... DO YOU KNOW
WHY YOU'RE HERE?

04:36.507 --> 04:38.309
I THINK SO.

04:38.309 --> 04:40.311
SHOW HER
YOUR TROPHIES, SWEETIE.

04:40.311 --> 04:42.413
(jangle)

04:45.916 --> 04:47.358
YOU HAD A LITTLE BREAK.

04:47.358 --> 04:49.019
LOOK, WELL, IT'S NO BIGGIE.
I MEAN, STRESS CAN CAUSE THAT.

04:49.019 --> 04:50.821
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT FEELS LIKE
EVERYTHING IS--IS TOO MUCH,

04:50.821 --> 04:52.763
YOU KNOW, AND--AND YOU'RE
FALLING, RIGHT?

04:52.763 --> 04:54.325
(strained voice)
AND YOU'RE FALLING.

04:54.325 --> 04:55.896
(sighs)
YOU'RE FALLING AND FALLING.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.968
LYNN.
OH, SORRY.

04:57.968 --> 05:00.331
TURNS OUT WHEN YOUR DEAD
HUSBAND HAS ANOTHER FAMILY,

05:00.331 --> 05:03.033
THEY HAVE A MORTGAGE, TOO.
(laughs) HERMAN!

05:03.033 --> 05:06.377
(laughs) SO, GRAYSON,
YOU NEED TO REMEMBER

05:06.377 --> 05:07.678
THAT WHEN YOU MARRY JULES,

05:07.678 --> 05:09.510
YOU'RE MARRYING EVERYONE
IN HER LIFE,

05:09.510 --> 05:11.642
AND, JULES, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU NEED TO WORK ON?

05:11.642 --> 05:14.415
NOT BEING SO TURNED-ON
WHEN HE GETS VIOLENT.

05:14.415 --> 05:17.488
I UNDERSTAND WHY WOMEN STAY
WITH MURDERERS NOW,

05:17.488 --> 05:21.422
BECAUSE... I WOULD.

05:21.422 --> 05:25.356
WOW. OKAY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO CIRCLE BACK TO THAT,

05:25.356 --> 05:27.658
BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
THAT GRAYSON IS NOT YOU.

05:27.658 --> 05:30.100
HE NEEDS PRIVACY
IN HIS HOME.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.101
(intercom buzzes)

05:31.101 --> 05:33.604
OH. ONE SECOND.

05:33.604 --> 05:36.066
I WISH I HAD RIPPED
ANDY'S EAR OFF.
(door opens)

05:36.066 --> 05:37.568
OHH.

05:37.568 --> 05:39.840
(keys jangle)

05:39.840 --> 05:41.412
J-JULES, IS...

05:43.474 --> 05:44.475
YOUR SHIRT OFF?

05:44.475 --> 05:45.976
OH. (chuckles)

05:45.976 --> 05:47.748
NOT ANYMORE. (chuckles)

05:47.748 --> 05:50.451
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?
(sighs)

05:50.451 --> 05:52.022
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT WHAT LYNN SAID.

05:52.022 --> 05:53.454
YOU MEAN
WHEN SHE YELLED AT US

05:53.454 --> 05:54.755
FOR HAVING SEX
IN HER BATHROOM?

05:54.755 --> 05:57.688
(sighs) ABOUT YOU NEEDING
SOME PRIVACY, YOU KNOW?

05:57.688 --> 05:59.430
FROM NOW ON,
I WANT YOU TO THINK

05:59.430 --> 06:03.534
OF THIS BEDROOM
AS YOUR NEW ISLAND HIDEAWAY.

06:03.534 --> 06:06.837
NO ONE IS ALLOWED IN HERE
WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION.

06:06.837 --> 06:08.038
YOU'RE AWESOME.

06:10.701 --> 06:15.045
YOU'RE INVITED
ONTO MY ISLAND RIGHT NOW.

06:15.045 --> 06:16.977
THIS SOON
AFTER LYNN'S BATHROOM?

06:16.977 --> 06:20.751
COME ON, GIRL. I'M ONLY 41.
I'M ALWAYS READY.

06:20.751 --> 06:22.082
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
NO.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.884
OH.
BUT I WAS HOPING
YOU WOULD TURN ME DOWN,

06:23.884 --> 06:25.756
SO I DIDN'T HAVE
TO ADMIT IT.

06:25.756 --> 06:28.859
GOTCHA. (chuckles)

06:28.859 --> 06:31.892
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU BETTER RUN.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.594
PAUSE.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.165
OKAY, BILL MURRAY IS
A MEAN WEATHERMAN.

06:35.165 --> 06:36.467
HE WAKES UP.
IT'S THE SAME DAY.

06:36.467 --> 06:39.169
I GET IT, BUT HOW COME
THE OTHER PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE

06:39.169 --> 06:41.401
THEY'RE TRAPPED
IN THE SAME DAY, TOO?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.103
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TRAPPED.
THEY'RE JUST THERE.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.735
WHEN THE SAME THING KEEPS
HAPPENING OVER AND OVER AGAIN...

06:44.735 --> 06:46.136
(chuckles)
WHAT DO THEY THINK?

06:46.136 --> 06:47.578
NO, THEY DON'T THINK.

06:47.578 --> 06:48.609
SO THEY'RE, LIKE, ROBOTS?

06:48.609 --> 06:49.610
I MEAN, I KNOW
THEY'RE NOT ROBOTS.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.142
I'M NOT THAT DUMB, BUT...

06:52.142 --> 06:53.744
ARE THEY ROBOTS?

06:53.744 --> 06:55.446
ALREADY PRAYING FOR DEATH.
(sighs)

06:55.446 --> 06:57.448
FINE. PLAY.

06:57.448 --> 06:58.549
(remote control clicks)

06:58.549 --> 06:59.720
OKAY. PAUSE.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.752
(chuckles) THAT IS SUCH
A CRAPPY HOTEL.

07:01.752 --> 07:04.455
WHY DOESN'T HE JUST CHECK
INTO A NEW PLACE?

07:04.455 --> 07:06.457
BECAUSE HE CAN'T CHANGE
THE DAY BEFORE IT STARTS.

07:06.457 --> 07:08.799
HE CAN ONLY CHANGE IT
AFTER IT STARTS.

07:08.799 --> 07:11.602
(laughing)
DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF?

07:11.602 --> 07:13.433
PLEASE. PLAY.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.165
ARE YOU GONNA SAY "PLAY"
AND "PAUSE" EVERY TIME?

07:15.165 --> 07:16.507
PAUSE. YES.

07:16.507 --> 07:17.568
PLAY.
(chuckles)

07:17.568 --> 07:20.010
OH, WAIT. PAUSE.
BIG LOU NEEDS A REFILL.

07:20.010 --> 07:21.872
OKAY. GOT IT. (grunts)

07:21.872 --> 07:23.914
DEAR GOD,
YOUR DRESS IS SO SHORT,

07:23.914 --> 07:25.916
I CAN SEE YOUR I.U.D.

07:25.916 --> 07:27.618
IT'S STILL
A BACHELORETTE PARTY,

07:27.618 --> 07:29.650
EVEN THOUGH
IT'S A TOTAL SNOOZE-FEST.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.922
OH, COME ON.
LAURIE, I'M 43.

07:31.922 --> 07:34.655
I HAD MY WILD BACHELORETTE PARTY
AT MY FIRST WEDDING.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.086
MAN, I GOT SO DRUNK,

07:36.086 --> 07:38.489
I WOKE UP IN THE OCEAN.
(chuckles)

07:38.489 --> 07:41.662
EXACTLY, WHICH IS WHY
I PREDICT

07:41.662 --> 07:43.634
THAT BY THE END
OF THIS NIGHT,

07:43.634 --> 07:46.196
WE ARE GONNA BE CRAZY DRUNK
IN SOME CLUB,

07:46.196 --> 07:48.198
AND THAT DOWDY OLD CARDIGAN
ELLIE'S WEARING

07:48.198 --> 07:51.101
IS GONNA BE FLOSSIN'
SOME HARD BODY'S JUNK.

07:51.101 --> 07:53.804
YOU HAVE PERFECTLY PREDICTED
THE FUTURE.

07:53.804 --> 07:56.006
YOU'RE HO-STRADAMUS.

07:56.006 --> 07:58.248
I AM. HO-STRADAMUS.

07:58.248 --> 08:00.611
THAT'S RIGHT.
I LOVE THE NEW NICKNAME.

08:00.611 --> 08:02.883
в™Є HO-STRADAMUS в™Є

08:02.883 --> 08:05.556
в™Є HO-STRADAMUS в™Є

08:05.556 --> 08:07.157
(clenched teeth)
PUT THE PIN BACK IN.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.061
WHY IS NOBODY SHOOTING?

08:11.061 --> 08:13.824
I CAN'T TECHNICALLY GO AGAIN
UNTIL I WRITE DOWN

08:13.824 --> 08:16.567
A DOZEN VAN HALEN SONGS,
AND ANDY GOT A DOUBLE-RIMMER,

08:16.567 --> 08:18.999
SO HE'S GOT
TEN MORE SKIP LAPS.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.170
NINE MORE!

08:20.170 --> 08:22.202
THERE'S TOO MANY
STUPID RULES.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.174
THE 'STACHE ATTACKS
AND THE EAR FLICKS WERE FINE,

08:24.174 --> 08:26.637
BUT NOW YOU'VE GOT
TO SNORT SALSA,

08:26.637 --> 08:28.609
BUY FROYO WEARING
NOTHING BUT SAND,

08:28.609 --> 08:30.210
BRUSH DOG TRAVIS' TEETH.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.582
(grunts)

08:31.582 --> 08:34.545
ALL THE RULES MAKE IT BETTER.
MY CALVES ARE ON FIRE!

08:34.545 --> 08:35.686
YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO COVER UP THE FACT

08:35.686 --> 08:37.918
THAT PENNY CAN ISN'T FUN
ANYMORE.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.620
(panting)

08:39.620 --> 08:41.722
IF YOU SPEAK ILL
OF THE CAN AGAIN,

08:41.722 --> 08:44.855
YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF
IN A COBB HEADLOCK,

08:44.855 --> 08:46.897
AND F.Y.I.,
MY DEODORANT THIS MORNING

08:46.897 --> 08:49.560
WAS DOWN TO THE PLASTIC.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.832
YOU THINK I'M WRONG?
ONE GAME--

08:51.832 --> 08:56.066
GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED,
NO-FRILLS PENNY CAN.

08:56.066 --> 08:58.038
SHOW ME IT'S STILL FUN.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.740
GAME ON.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.973
(pennies clatter)

09:02.973 --> 09:04.044
(clanks)

09:04.044 --> 09:06.076
(all, monotone voices)
PENNY CAN.

09:07.077 --> 09:09.750
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.622
PAUSE.

09:11.622 --> 09:13.924
SO IF BILL MURRAY
CAN DO ANYTHING,

09:13.924 --> 09:14.925
HOW COME HE CAN'T SAVE

09:14.925 --> 09:16.587
THE OLD HOMELESS GUY
FROM DYING?

09:16.587 --> 09:19.229
BECAUSE SOME THINGS
YOU CAN'T CHANGE.

09:19.229 --> 09:21.231
WELL, HE SAVED
THE LITTLE KID IN THE TREE.

09:21.231 --> 09:23.163
BECAUSE SOME THINGS
YOU CAN CHANGE.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.235
YOU CAN SAVE CHILDREN,
BUT YOU CAN'T SAVE

09:25.235 --> 09:27.567
OLD HOMELESS PEOPLE?
(sighs)

09:27.567 --> 09:29.299
WHO HAS A CIGARETTE?
I HAVEN'T SMOKED IN 20 YEARS.

09:29.299 --> 09:30.801
I NEED A SMOKE.

09:30.801 --> 09:33.704
OKAY, THIS IS MY FINAL
"GROUNDHOG DAY" QUESTION.

09:33.704 --> 09:36.106
FORGET THAT HE CAN LEARN
TO PLAY THE PIANO

09:36.106 --> 09:38.749
BUT HE CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE
THE PUDDLE IS.

09:38.749 --> 09:41.982
LET'S EVEN FORGET THAT
IT'S CLEARLY THE SAME GROUNDHOG

09:41.982 --> 09:44.354
THAT BILL MURRAY USED
IN "CADDYSHACK."

09:44.354 --> 09:46.016
OH, MY GOD.
DON'T.

09:46.016 --> 09:48.989
(door opens and closes)
WHY DOES THE DAY FINALLY END?

09:48.989 --> 09:51.662
EVERYONE, SIT DOWN.

09:51.662 --> 09:52.963
WHAT?
HELLO?

09:52.963 --> 09:54.725
PENNY CAN IS DEAD.

09:54.725 --> 09:57.628
MAN, WHY COULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN
SOMETHING NO ONE CARES ABOUT,

09:57.628 --> 10:00.931
LIKE HOCKEY
OR THE GOLDEN GLOBES?

10:00.931 --> 10:02.903
ALL RIGHT,
I'M WEARING A TIARA,

10:02.903 --> 10:05.275
SO WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GO
BOTHER SOMEONE ELSE?

10:05.275 --> 10:08.709
SMOKES?
YOU GUYS GOT ANY SMOKES?

10:08.709 --> 10:10.010
UH-OH.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.381
MY NANNY HAS SOME NICOTINE GUM
IN HER DRAWER.

10:11.381 --> 10:12.683
I'LL BE BACK.

10:12.683 --> 10:14.715
OH, BOY.

10:16.286 --> 10:18.388
SIT DOWN.
NO.

10:18.388 --> 10:20.120
PENNY CAN IS DEAD.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.392
I'LL LIVE.
GO BE SAD ON YOUR BOAT.

10:22.392 --> 10:24.294
JULES TOLD US TO COME UP
HERE AND BUG YOU.

10:24.294 --> 10:26.797
JULES KIKI COBB, GET UP HERE!

10:26.797 --> 10:29.700
UH-OH. (singsongy)
SOMEONE'S IN TROUBLE.

10:29.700 --> 10:32.032
WHAT? WE'RE ON THE SECOND FLOOR.
HOW ARE YOU EVEN HERE?

10:32.032 --> 10:33.964
OH, I'M, UH, RETURNING
JULES' LADDER.

10:33.964 --> 10:35.766
YOU SOUND MAD.

10:35.766 --> 10:37.237
YOU WANNA PUNCH
ANOTHER WALL, BABY?

10:37.237 --> 10:39.639
DO NOT FIND
THIS ATTRACTIVE!

10:39.639 --> 10:40.771
I GOT A PROBLEM.

10:40.771 --> 10:43.674
DID YOU ASK ANDY AND BOBBY
TO COME UP HERE AND BUG ME?

10:43.674 --> 10:46.076
NO. I TOLD THEM TO COME BUG
SOMEONE ELSE.

10:46.076 --> 10:47.678
I-I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO THAT WOULD BE.

10:47.678 --> 10:49.820
WELL, DID YOU SEE THEM
COME UP THE STAIRS?!

10:49.820 --> 10:52.282
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY THING
UPSTAIRS.

10:52.282 --> 10:54.384
THE LOTION IS UPSTAIRS.

10:54.384 --> 10:55.756
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:55.756 --> 10:56.927
HEY. WHATCHA DOIN'?

10:56.927 --> 10:59.730
OH... MY... GOD!

10:59.730 --> 11:01.792
THIS IS THE SAME ISSUE
OVER AND OVER! (chuckles)

11:01.792 --> 11:03.233
IT'S "GROUNDHOG DAY."

11:03.233 --> 11:04.795
OH. (chuckles)
YOU GAVE ME AN ISLAND,

11:04.795 --> 11:07.137
BUT YOU DIDN'T MEAN IT!

11:07.137 --> 11:09.039
NO, THAT IS NOT
WHAT HAPPENED.

11:09.039 --> 11:10.771
(ladder clatters)
AAH!

11:10.771 --> 11:12.803
(strained voice)
GUYS. LADDER FELL.

11:12.803 --> 11:14.945
YOU FORCED ME TO DO THIS.

11:14.945 --> 11:16.847
(Ellie and Jules gasp)

11:16.847 --> 11:18.248
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT?

11:18.248 --> 11:19.810
(gasps) PAUSE.

11:19.810 --> 11:22.312
(spits)
CAN'T PAUSE PEOPLE.

11:22.312 --> 11:23.313
AAH!

11:23.313 --> 11:25.716
(crash)

11:25.716 --> 11:29.419
IT'S OKAY! I'M NOT HURT...
MAYBE!

11:29.419 --> 11:30.420
YEAH.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.993
HEY, LAURIE.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.294
(high-pitched voice) WHOA!
(normal voice) HUH? WHAT?

11:34.294 --> 11:37.828
JULES ONLY WANTED ELLIE
TO BE HER MAID OF HONOR.

11:37.828 --> 11:39.730
SHE JUST ASKED YOU
OUT OF PITY.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.835
(sighs)

11:46.777 --> 11:48.078
IS THAT TRUE?

11:49.880 --> 11:51.842
(imitates explosion)

11:56.446 --> 11:57.447
FINE. MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE
THROWN THE GRENADE,

11:57.447 --> 11:59.149
BUT YOU HAVE
SOME RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS.

11:59.149 --> 12:00.450
TRUE.

12:00.450 --> 12:03.894
IT'S MY FAULT FOR TRUSTING YOU
NOT TO HURT ME ON PURPOSE.

12:03.894 --> 12:06.927
LOOK, TINTIN, I CAN'T HAVE
ANDY MOPING AROUND...
(sighs)

12:06.927 --> 12:08.428
BECAUSE YOU KILLED
PENNY CAN.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.500
MOPEY LEADS RIGHT
TO GROPEY.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.764
FIX IT OR BLEED.
FINE.

12:13.764 --> 12:15.435
LAURIE, I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.
(door opens and closes)

12:15.435 --> 12:17.808
I'M TEXTING
MY ARMY BOYFRIEND WADE

12:17.808 --> 12:20.470
A PICTURE, SO HE CAN SEE WHAT
A TOTAL JERK LOOKS LIKE.

12:20.470 --> 12:22.242
(camera shutter clicks, beep)
OH, GAH.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.445
YOU KNOW, JULES,
YOU REALLY HURT ME.

12:25.445 --> 12:29.249
I WAS SO PROUD WHEN YOU MADE ME
YOUR CO-MAID OF HONOR,

12:29.249 --> 12:31.822
BUT YOU DIDN'T DO IT
OUT OF LOVE.

12:31.822 --> 12:33.854
YOU JUST DID IT
TO SHUT ME UP.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.757
WHAT HAPPENED?
DID SHE STORM OUT?
(door opens)

12:37.757 --> 12:39.790
WHY ARE YOU SO LOW, TOM?
(door closes)

12:39.790 --> 12:40.760
UH, I'M IN A WHEELCHAIR.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.533
26 PINS IN MY LEG--
NEW FLORIDA RECORD.

12:43.533 --> 12:44.965
DON'T YOU DARE GIVE ME

12:44.965 --> 12:47.838
THAT BITCH GRIN YOU GET
WHEN LAURIE'S UPSET.

12:47.838 --> 12:50.540
WHAT? DOGS BARK. FISH SWIM.
I BITCH GRIN.

12:50.540 --> 12:52.302
HOW ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

12:52.302 --> 12:53.473
DID SHE STORM OUT?

12:53.473 --> 12:55.205
I'M NOT DOING
PLAY-BY-PLAY, TOM.

12:55.205 --> 12:56.847
OH, NO PROBLEM.

12:59.449 --> 13:00.510
(whack)

13:00.510 --> 13:02.552
BALL.

13:02.552 --> 13:03.783
BALL'S UP.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.816
HEY, GUYS.

13:05.816 --> 13:07.417
ARE YOU HERE TO KILL
SOMETHING ELSE I LOVE?

13:07.417 --> 13:08.458
IF YOU SAY ANYTHING BAD

13:08.458 --> 13:10.390
ABOUT LEATHER SANDALS,
I SWEAR TO GOD--

13:10.390 --> 13:13.163
THEY ARE RIDICULOUS, BUT, NO,
THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.

13:13.163 --> 13:17.797
I HAVE A GREAT IDEA
ON HOW TO REBOOT PENNY CAN!

13:17.797 --> 13:20.570
NICKEL CAN. THE STAKES
HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER.

13:20.570 --> 13:24.504
THANKS FOR TRYING,
BUT IT'S OVER, SON. OHH.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.806
(whack)
LET'S FACE IT.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.838
PENNY CAN WAS JUST
A BORING GAME

13:27.838 --> 13:30.810
ABOUT GETTING A TINY ROUND THING
INTO A HOLE...

13:30.810 --> 13:31.842
(whack)

13:31.842 --> 13:34.514
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.546
(whack)
THAT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING
A MAN CAN DO

13:36.546 --> 13:38.518
EVERY WEEKEND
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.051
(sighs)
OH. DARN IT. I'M OUT.

13:41.051 --> 13:42.322
AT LEAST LET ME BUY YOU
ANOTHER BUCKET.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.855
NAH, DON'T NEED TO.
(whistles) COME HERE, BOY!

13:44.855 --> 13:46.226
DOG TRAVIS COLLECTS 'EM
AS I GO.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.298
HOW MANY CAN HE HOLD
IN HIS MOUTH?

13:48.298 --> 13:51.331
(balls clattering)

13:57.007 --> 13:58.438
ENOUGH.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.870
(ball clatters)

13:59.870 --> 14:02.612
HEY, JELLY BEAN.

14:02.612 --> 14:04.544
I KNOW
YOU PROBABLY WANT TO RUB

14:04.544 --> 14:05.545
THE WHOLE MAID OF HONOR THING
IN MY FACE,

14:05.545 --> 14:07.547
BUT CAN YOU JUST...

14:07.547 --> 14:10.881
PLEASE JUST BE MEAN
TO ME LATER?

14:10.881 --> 14:12.082
NO PROBLEM.
I WAS GONNA DO THAT ANYWAY.

14:12.082 --> 14:14.925
YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO USE
MY GRENADE.

14:14.925 --> 14:16.556
NOW JULES IS SUPER PISSED AT ME,

14:16.556 --> 14:18.628
AND I'M ADDICTED
TO NICOTINE GUM!

14:18.628 --> 14:20.891
LOOK, LAURIE,
I AM SORRY I SAID IT.

14:20.891 --> 14:23.994
WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST TELL ME?
I CAN HANDLE DISAPPOINTMENT.

14:23.994 --> 14:25.335
WHEN YOU'RE 8
AND YOUR MOM PRETENDS

14:25.335 --> 14:26.937
THAT YOU'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED
SO THAT SHE CAN MEET

14:26.937 --> 14:28.468
THE LOCAL NEWS ANCHOR,

14:28.468 --> 14:30.440
YOU KNOW,
YOU LEARN TO BE RESILIENT.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.072
I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.204
THERE ARE SOME BAD THINGS
ABOUT THIS GUM.

14:34.204 --> 14:35.305
I DIDN'T SLEEP AT ALL
LAST NIGHT,

14:35.305 --> 14:36.646
PLUS MY TEETH ARE BLEEDING
A LITTLE,

14:36.646 --> 14:40.450
BUT IT MAKES YOU SEE THINGS
SUPER CLEARLY.

14:40.450 --> 14:42.282
IT'S LIKE EPIPHANY GUM.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.184
HUH?
REALIZATION GUM.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.185
GOT IT.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.886
THIS IS ALL JULES' FAULT.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.519
PLUS I THINK IF I'M NOT BACK
TO WORK BEFORE I'M 50,

14:49.519 --> 14:51.291
I'M GONNA LEAVE ANDY.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.323
I WISH THERE WAS A WAY
WE COULD GET JULES

14:53.323 --> 14:55.295
TO OWN UP TO HER PART
IN ALL THIS.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.467
WELL, DOES ANYONE HAVE
ANY IDEAS?

14:57.467 --> 14:59.369
HOLD ON.

14:59.369 --> 15:01.031
(crunches)

15:01.031 --> 15:03.673
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

15:03.673 --> 15:06.536
(indistinct conversations)

15:06.536 --> 15:08.478
GOT IT.

15:08.478 --> 15:12.042
(Sonny & Cher on radio)
в™Є I GOT YOU BABE в™Є

15:12.042 --> 15:15.415
в™Є I GOT YOU BABE в™Є

15:17.988 --> 15:21.391
FINE. MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE
THROWN THE GRENADE,

15:21.391 --> 15:24.254
BUT YOU HAVE
SOME RESPONSIBILITY IN ALL THIS.

15:24.254 --> 15:25.325
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:25.325 --> 15:27.327
LOOK, TINTIN,

15:27.327 --> 15:31.201
I CAN'T HAVE ANDY MOPING AROUND
BECAUSE YOU KILLED PENNY CAN.
(sighs)

15:31.201 --> 15:35.135
MOPEY LEADS RIGHT TO GROPEY.
FIX IT OR BLEED.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.336
FINE.

15:36.336 --> 15:39.409
WAIT. ARE WE PLAYING
"GROUNDHOG DAY"?

15:39.409 --> 15:41.671
(door opens)
I HATE CONFUSING GAMES.

15:41.671 --> 15:44.414
(door closes)
REMEMBER THAT CORN MAZE
I GOT STUCK IN LAST HALLOWEEN?

15:44.414 --> 15:47.117
I CRIED ALL NIGHT
UNTIL THOSE DOGS FOUND ME.

15:47.117 --> 15:49.079
I'M TEXTING
MY ARMY BOYFRIEND WADE

15:49.079 --> 15:51.982
A PICTURE, SO HE CAN SEE WHAT
A TOTAL JERK LOOKS LIKE.

15:51.982 --> 15:53.623
(camera shutter clicks, beep)
OHH! STUPID FLASH!

15:53.623 --> 15:56.486
YOU KNOW, JULES,
YOU REALLY HURT ME.

15:56.486 --> 15:59.259
I WAS SO PROUD WHEN YOU MADE ME
YOUR CO-MAID OF HONOR, BUT--

15:59.259 --> 16:03.033
YOU ASKED ME, REMEMBER?
YOU PUT ME ON THE SPOT.

16:03.033 --> 16:05.695
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO,
JUST CRUSH YOU?

16:05.695 --> 16:07.998
(scoffs)

16:07.998 --> 16:10.270
WHAT HAPPENED?
I'M IN A WHEELCHAIR.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.702
(door opens)
(Tom and Jules)
26 PINS--NEW FLORIDA RECORD.

16:12.702 --> 16:16.146
(door closes)
WE ALL KNOW, TOM!
I HATE THIS.

16:16.146 --> 16:20.410
WHAT? DOGS BARK. FISH SWIM.
I BITCH GRIN.

16:20.410 --> 16:22.552
HOW COULD YOU BE MAD AT ME?

16:22.552 --> 16:24.614
STOP SAYING THE SAME THINGS!

16:31.321 --> 16:32.392
2%?

16:32.392 --> 16:33.523
SKIM.

16:33.523 --> 16:34.694
YOU WANNA PLAY AGAIN?

16:34.694 --> 16:37.027
I DON'T REALLY LOVE
MILKY GUESSY.

16:37.027 --> 16:38.228
OH, ME NEITHER.
IT'S BORING.

16:38.228 --> 16:40.670
PLUS DAIRY PRODUCTS GIVE ME
THE SPLATS.

16:40.670 --> 16:42.272
(pennies clank)

16:42.272 --> 16:45.135
WELL, THEN WHY NOT PLAY
A LITTLE PENNY CAN?

16:45.135 --> 16:46.676
NO, THANKS.
YOU WERE RIGHT, TRAV.

16:46.676 --> 16:48.778
PENNY CAN'S A STUPID GAME.
(sighs)

16:48.778 --> 16:50.340
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE GAME.

16:50.340 --> 16:53.183
PENNY CAN ISN'T JUST THROWING
A PENNY...

16:53.183 --> 16:54.184
(clanks)

16:54.184 --> 16:55.615
INTO A CAN.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.417
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.519
IT'S ABOUT TRADITION.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.751
IT MIGHT EVEN BE ABOUT AMERICA.

17:01.751 --> 17:03.793
YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO.
NICE TRY.

17:03.793 --> 17:05.655
(sighs) OKAY, WELL,
YOU KNOW, FOR ME,

17:05.655 --> 17:08.658
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN, LIKE,
A FATHER-SON THING,

17:08.658 --> 17:11.231
AND I'M GONNA BE 21
IN A FEW DAYS,

17:11.231 --> 17:12.662
AND I KNOW
I'LL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL

17:12.662 --> 17:14.764
FOR THE TIME
WE SPENT TOSSIN' COPPER.

17:14.764 --> 17:16.736
STAN?

17:16.736 --> 17:18.538
DADDY, WILL YOU THROW
PENNIES WITH ME?

17:18.538 --> 17:19.809
(chuckles)

17:19.809 --> 17:24.574
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S LIKE "FIELD OF DREAMS."

17:26.216 --> 17:27.217
(clanks)

17:27.217 --> 17:28.518
OOH. (singsongy) PENNY CAN!

17:28.518 --> 17:29.779
(Travis, Andy, and Bobby)
YEAH!

17:29.779 --> 17:32.152
(all, singsongy) PENNY CAN!

17:32.152 --> 17:34.053
YEAH!
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GONNA PLAY, SON?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.255
NO, I GOT THINGS TO DO.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.130
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
I HAVE TO BE IN BED AGAIN.

17:40.130 --> 17:41.831
(Ellie) BECAUSE THAT'S
HOW IT WORKS!

17:41.831 --> 17:45.135
(Sonny & Cher)
в™Є I GOT YOU BABE в™Є

17:45.135 --> 17:48.398
HOW DID YOU RIG THE CLOCK
TO DO THAT?

17:48.398 --> 17:53.643
YEAH, YEAH. GRENADE.
KEEP IT MOVIN'. WE'RE DONE.

17:53.643 --> 17:57.277
LOOK, TINTIN, I CAN'T HAVE ANDY
MOPIN' AROUND, BECAUSE--

17:57.277 --> 17:58.378
YEP, YEP, YEP.
MOPEY, GROPEY. GOT IT.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.779
COME ON. LET'S GO.
BYE, TRAV.

17:59.779 --> 18:00.850
I'M TEXTING
MY ARMY BOYFRIEND WADE--
(door opens)

18:00.850 --> 18:02.452
JUST TAKE THE PICTURE.
(camera shutter clicks, beep)

18:02.452 --> 18:04.784
OH, GOD!
IT GETS ME EVERY TIME.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.487
YOU KNOW, JULES,
YOU REALLY HURT ME.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.119
I WAS SO PROUD WHEN YOU--

18:09.119 --> 18:11.090
LAURIE, STOP. THIS IS HELL.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.124
I-I CANNOT HEAR AGAIN
HOW MUCH I HURT YOU.

18:14.124 --> 18:17.827
I'M SO SORRY I DID THAT.
I HATE DISAPPOINTING PEOPLE.

18:17.827 --> 18:19.829
(Tom) WHAT'S GOING ON?
I CAN'T SEE.

18:19.829 --> 18:21.871
26 PINS--NEW RECORD.

18:21.871 --> 18:23.603
BRING IT HOME, JULES.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.176
I SHOULD HAVE TRUSTED THAT
OUR FRIENDSHIP WAS STRONG ENOUGH

18:26.176 --> 18:28.478
TO BE UP-FRONT
WITH EACH OTHER.

18:28.478 --> 18:29.809
I LOVE YOU.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.682
I'M SO HAPPY THAT
YOU'RE IN MY WEDDING...

18:32.682 --> 18:35.745
(whispers)
AND I'M SO, SO SORRY.

18:35.745 --> 18:39.219
(voice breaks) OKAY.
(chuckles) OHH.

18:39.219 --> 18:42.152
OH, YEAH. NICE.

18:42.152 --> 18:43.353
(knock on door)
("I Got You Babe" playing)

18:43.353 --> 18:44.754
PERMISSION TO ENTER?

18:44.754 --> 18:46.125
PERMISSION GRANTED.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.198
SO I FINALLY FIGURED OUT
"GROUNDHOG DAY."

18:48.198 --> 18:51.431
(chuckles) MAN, THAT MOVIE
REALLY OPENED MY EYES.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.363
BILL MURRAY COMEDIES
WILL DO THAT.

18:53.363 --> 18:57.167
LOOK, I KNOW
THIS IS REALLY HARD,

18:57.167 --> 18:59.209
LIVING IN A HOUSE FULL
OF PEOPLE...

18:59.209 --> 19:01.611
(sighs) HEADING TOWARDS
A BIG WEDDING.

19:01.611 --> 19:03.343
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I WANT
OUR RELATIONSHIP

19:03.343 --> 19:05.615
TO BE JUST OURS, YOU KNOW?

19:05.615 --> 19:08.218
GRAYSON, ALL I WANT TO DO
IS MAKE YOU HAPPY.

19:08.218 --> 19:09.879
I MEAN, EVERY NOW AND THEN,
I MAY NEED YOU

19:09.879 --> 19:14.284
TO GET PRISON-YARD ANGRY...
(chuckles)

19:14.284 --> 19:16.456
MAYBE WEAR A DO-RAG.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.857
DONE.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.790
I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

19:20.790 --> 19:22.232
в™Є I GOT YOU в™Є

19:22.232 --> 19:23.693
THEN LET'S ELOPE.

19:23.693 --> 19:25.335
SERIOUSLY?

19:25.335 --> 19:28.198
YOU WANTED TO GO TO NAPA
FOR OUR HONEYMOON.

19:28.198 --> 19:31.201
LET'S GO THERE NOW
AND GET MARRIED.

19:31.201 --> 19:33.873
NO HUGE WEDDING.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.775
JUST US.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.707
в™Є AND IF I GET SCARED в™Є

19:37.707 --> 19:39.379
LET'S DO IT.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.910
(chuckles)

19:40.910 --> 19:44.254
в™Є YOU'RE ALWAYS AROUND в™Є

19:44.254 --> 19:47.687
в™Є I GOT YOU TO HOLD MY HAND в™Є

19:47.687 --> 19:50.220
в™Є I GOT YOU TO... в™Є

19:50.220 --> 19:53.823
OHH. I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE HERE. JUST US.

19:53.823 --> 19:54.824
(horn honks)

19:54.824 --> 19:57.267
(cheering)

19:57.267 --> 19:59.769
WE BROUGHT
OUR OWN WINEGLASSES!

19:59.769 --> 20:02.402
LET'S POUND SOME GRAPE!
(chuckles) YEAH!

20:02.402 --> 20:04.404
NOT WHAT I MEANT BY "JUST US."

20:04.404 --> 20:05.405
WHOO!

20:05.405 --> 20:06.776
(blows raspberry)
(Andy) ALL RIGHT!

20:06.776 --> 20:08.207
в™Є I GOT YOU BABE в™Є
MMM. MERLOT.

20:08.207 --> 20:08.978
UH, WINE?

20:08.978 --> 20:10.940
THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH
TO START.
HI.

20:10.940 --> 20:12.242
CHEERS, MY BRIDE.
(clink)

20:12.242 --> 20:14.244
в™Є I GOT YOU BABE в™Є

20:18.688 --> 20:20.590
AHH! NICE GRAB, TOMMY!

20:22.522 --> 20:25.695
UH-OH. AHH! GOOD ONE.

20:26.856 --> 20:28.798
(groaning)

20:28.798 --> 20:30.430
(Frisbee clatters)

20:30.430 --> 20:32.902
(sighs)

20:32.902 --> 20:33.903
(groans)

20:33.903 --> 20:35.865
THAT'S OKAY, TOMMY!

20:35.865 --> 20:37.967
YOU'RE DOING GREAT!
YOU'RE HAVING FUN!

20:40.740 --> 20:43.873
OH, WATCH OUT, BIRDS!
(bird squawks)
