WEBVTT

00:06.239 --> 00:07.263
Anything?

00:07.340 --> 00:08.637
Not really.

00:08.708 --> 00:11.836
The polyferranide deposits
are contaminated with astiline.

00:11.911 --> 00:13.879
Commander, there's
something over here

00:13.947 --> 00:14.971
l think you should see.

00:15.048 --> 00:16.948
Pack it up.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.644
We'll find better quality
somewhere down the line.

00:18.718 --> 00:19.844
That line is going
to be cut short

00:19.919 --> 00:21.511
when our nacelles
burn themselves up

00:21.588 --> 00:22.748
if we don't find it soon.

00:22.822 --> 00:24.346
What have you got, Lieutenant?

00:24.424 --> 00:27.450
There have been other visitors
to this moon recently.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.495
What do you think this is?

00:29.562 --> 00:30.859
Some kind of message?

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:44.010 --> 00:46.035
l don't want you
to go wandering off.

00:46.112 --> 00:47.602
l'm not.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.204
l'm just looking at something.

00:49.282 --> 00:51.341
Antonio.

00:51.418 --> 00:54.251
Vay-chit no-op-puse-nee.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.379
Chakotay, kay-nee-post.

00:56.456 --> 00:58.287
Pon-ah-chee nun-pah-hee-no.

00:58.358 --> 01:01.657
Kay-nee-post itchee-oh.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.719
Kep-pon-nee!

01:03.797 --> 01:05.128
He says you're quite a scout.

01:05.197 --> 01:06.825
A kep-pon-nee.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.869
l was just looking at a lizard
when l saw it.

01:09.936 --> 01:11.699
Well, it was your eyes
that saw it.

01:11.771 --> 01:12.738
No one else's did.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.933
That's the important thing.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.202
Come.

01:16.276 --> 01:18.301
l want you to understand this.

01:21.714 --> 01:22.976
lt's a blessing to the land.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.484
An ancient healing symbol.

01:26.553 --> 01:28.248
A CHAH-mooz-ee.

01:28.321 --> 01:31.518
They probably cut this down
for firewood.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.422
The Rubber Tree people?

01:33.493 --> 01:36.257
Well, the closest thing to
the Ancient Rubber Tree people

01:36.329 --> 01:37.660
that we'll ever see.

01:37.730 --> 01:40.824
The people in this tribe
are their descendants.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.026
Just like we are.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.264
But they never left this jungle.

01:45.338 --> 01:48.171
And they rarely intermarry
with other tribes.

01:48.241 --> 01:50.903
And they still use firewood
instead of magnesite fuel

01:50.977 --> 01:51.909
like everyone else.

01:51.978 --> 01:55.345
Chakotay, they've chosen

01:55.415 --> 01:56.712
to live like this for centuries.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.216
That's why we are traveling
on foot

01:58.284 --> 01:59.876
and not using a transporter.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.978
We honor the Sky Spirits

02:02.055 --> 02:05.582
who led our ancestors
to this sacred land.

02:05.658 --> 02:07.285
Sacred land?

02:07.360 --> 02:08.327
Yes.

02:08.394 --> 02:09.656
Huh.

02:09.729 --> 02:13.221
The Sky Spirits must have taken
a wrong turn somewhere.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.745
Maybe it's
a blessing to the land.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.975
For damaging it
with the campfire.

02:30.083 --> 02:33.280
What is your basis
for that conclusion, Commander?

02:35.355 --> 02:37.721
Oh, just...

02:37.790 --> 02:39.655
something somebody told me once.

04:33.072 --> 04:35.404
Describe the nature
of your pain.

04:35.475 --> 04:36.908
ln the lower back.

04:36.976 --> 04:38.273
lt's tight.

04:38.344 --> 04:40.574
Choose the word that would
best describe your pain.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.547
Burning, throbbing, piercing,

04:42.615 --> 04:44.879
pinching, biting,
stinging, shooting...

04:44.951 --> 04:45.883
Shooting.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.579
lt even goes down my legs.

04:47.654 --> 04:48.621
Hmm.

04:48.688 --> 04:50.679
ls the baby all right?

04:50.757 --> 04:51.849
Hmm? Oh, certainly.

04:51.924 --> 04:53.653
Fine, nothing to worry about.

04:53.726 --> 04:55.853
Well, that makes me feel better.

04:55.928 --> 04:56.917
The position of the baby

04:56.996 --> 04:58.987
is simply putting pressure
on your sciatic nerve.

04:59.065 --> 05:01.033
You may return to your post.

05:01.100 --> 05:05.833
The pain makes it difficult
to sit for any period of time.

05:05.905 --> 05:07.395
lt's really quite uncomfortable.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.997
Elevating your legs when you sit

05:09.075 --> 05:10.906
should provide
all the relief you need.

05:11.010 --> 05:13.535
Perhaps a day of rest, off-duty.

05:13.613 --> 05:14.580
Mm-mm.

05:16.215 --> 05:18.342
Ensign Wildman, according
to your medical history,

05:18.418 --> 05:20.181
this is your first pregnancy,
correct?

05:20.253 --> 05:21.686
Yes.

05:21.754 --> 05:23.187
Well, Ensign, unfortunately,
pregnancy causes

05:23.256 --> 05:24.188
its fair share of discomforts

05:24.257 --> 05:25.622
and you'll have
to learn to live with them.

05:25.692 --> 05:27.125
That's just the way it is.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.184
We'll schedule her
for follow-up in two days.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.389
lf the pain has not subsided
on its own by then,

05:31.464 --> 05:32.488
we'll attempt to decrease

05:32.565 --> 05:34.430
the sensitivity
of the nerve in that region.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.762
Thank you, Doctor.

05:40.473 --> 05:43.237
Call me day or night
if this gets any worse.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.976
Don't you have any compassion
for the way she feels?

05:50.083 --> 05:52.142
Every member of this crew
is an adult.

05:52.218 --> 05:53.981
l will not coddle them.

05:54.053 --> 05:56.578
Compassion can be
your department.

05:56.656 --> 05:58.886
Fortunately, you have
enough for both of us.

05:58.958 --> 06:01.483
You've never been
sick or in pain.

06:01.561 --> 06:04.155
l just wish, once in your life,
you could know what it's like,

06:04.230 --> 06:05.458
how it makes you
feel vulnerable

06:05.531 --> 06:06.463
and a little afraid.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.124
Then you'd understand.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.199
l don't have a life.

06:16.242 --> 06:17.732
l have a program.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.918
l hated every minute of it.

06:25.985 --> 06:28.476
My father had dragged me
all the way from our colony

06:28.554 --> 06:31.284
near the Cardassian border
on this quest of his.

06:31.357 --> 06:35.453
Away from my friends, my home,
and here we were, in the middle

06:35.528 --> 06:37.462
of a brutal Central
American jungle

06:37.530 --> 06:39.896
looking for the descendants
of the Ancient Rubber people.

06:39.966 --> 06:42.093
lt must have been
very important to him.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.226
Believe me, it was.

06:43.302 --> 06:44.269
And he was very disappointed

06:44.337 --> 06:46.805
that l didn't
share his enthusiasm.

06:46.873 --> 06:49.671
He'd been tracking down the
origins of our tribe for years.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.980
The one on the right
is the one l found today.

06:56.048 --> 07:00.542
And now, something you saw
on that trip years ago,

07:00.620 --> 07:02.815
shows up again
on a moon surface

07:02.889 --> 07:05.517
almost 70,000 light-years away.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.456
l don't suppose
you have any theories

07:10.530 --> 07:12.361
that might explain this.

07:13.766 --> 07:14.824
l can give you

07:14.901 --> 07:16.960
an official Rubber Tree
people theory if you like.

07:18.871 --> 07:22.967
-Sky Spirits.
-Sky Spirits?

07:23.042 --> 07:24.509
lt's an ancient myth.

07:24.577 --> 07:27.876
Sky Spirits from above
created the first Rubber people

07:27.947 --> 07:30.507
in their own image,
and led the way to a sacred land

07:30.583 --> 07:32.710
where the Rubber people
would live for eternity.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.650
You obviously don't
put a great deal of faith

07:34.720 --> 07:36.244
in this explanation.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.921
How much faith do you put
in Adam and Eve?

07:39.992 --> 07:41.289
Hasn't science proved

07:41.360 --> 07:43.760
that all humans developed
from a single

07:43.830 --> 07:44.922
evolutionary process?

07:44.997 --> 07:46.862
That's what l was always taught.

07:46.933 --> 07:48.924
On the other hand,
none of my teachers

07:49.035 --> 07:51.526
ever spent much time
in the Delta Quadrant.

07:52.705 --> 07:54.263
B'Elanna tells me we picked up

07:54.340 --> 07:56.433
a warp signature
heading away from the moon.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.033
Think we should follow it?

07:58.110 --> 07:59.338
l don't know that it's fair
for me

07:59.412 --> 08:03.143
to put my own personal curiosity
ahead of the ship's priorities.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.979
We still haven't found
the polyferranide

08:05.051 --> 08:06.484
we need to seal the warp coils.

08:06.552 --> 08:09.487
lf these people have warp
technology, they might be able

08:09.555 --> 08:10.579
to help us.

08:13.793 --> 08:15.351
Besides...

08:15.428 --> 08:18.727
we are in the business
of exploring, aren't we?

08:19.765 --> 08:22.393
My father would put on
his expedition hat

08:22.468 --> 08:23.867
and shout, ''Let's go!''

08:23.936 --> 08:25.904
l guess that's
good enough for me.

08:38.049 --> 08:39.847
Showing no life signs.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.909
Mr. Paris, are you certain
the warp signature ended here?

08:41.988 --> 08:43.615
Positive, Captain.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.288
Harry, check your sensors.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.385
That look like some kind
of power source to you?

08:49.462 --> 08:51.726
That is an unusually
high EM reading

08:51.797 --> 08:53.424
for a natural occurrence.

08:53.499 --> 08:55.262
Could be some kind
of cloaking technology.

08:55.334 --> 08:59.430
Mr. Kim, transmit a continuous
message on all frequencies

08:59.505 --> 09:01.336
identifying who we are,
where we're from

09:01.440 --> 09:03.101
and make it clear
our intentions are peaceful.

09:03.142 --> 09:04.074
Torres to Bridge.

09:04.143 --> 09:05.075
Go ahead.

09:05.144 --> 09:06.236
We're in luck, Captain.

09:06.312 --> 09:08.246
My readings are showing
high concentrations

09:08.314 --> 09:10.839
of polyferranide about ten
kilometers below the surface.

09:10.950 --> 09:11.848
Acknowledged.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.942
We'll send out an away team
to continue the survey.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.453
Report to Transporter Room 3.

09:15.521 --> 09:16.545
On my way.

09:16.622 --> 09:18.522
Commander,
if we meet any resistance

09:18.591 --> 09:19.523
abort the mission.

09:19.592 --> 09:21.321
l have no intention
of disturbing an alien race

09:21.394 --> 09:22.588
that would rather be left alone.

09:22.662 --> 09:23.594
Understood.

09:23.663 --> 09:26.291
On the other hand,
if we can make contact, our goal

09:26.365 --> 09:29.061
is to get permission to begin
excavation as soon as possible.

09:29.135 --> 09:30.727
Tuvok, you're with me.

09:30.803 --> 09:33.863
Mr. Neelix, please report
to Transporter Room 3

09:33.940 --> 09:35.271
for an away mission.

09:35.341 --> 09:36.899
l'll meet you there, Commander.

09:41.147 --> 09:42.876
We may be out of luck.

09:42.949 --> 09:44.211
Problem?

09:44.283 --> 09:45.875
l'm not sure
we can transport down.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.817
Every time we try
to lock on to a transport sight,

09:47.887 --> 09:48.876
a storm begins.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.547
Storm?

09:50.623 --> 09:53.319
We've tried seven different
sites and as soon as we lock on,

09:53.392 --> 09:55.360
an electrical storm forms
right above the location.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.690
When we change sites,

09:56.762 --> 09:58.753
a new storm forms
and the old one dissipates.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.731
Might the transporter
beam itself

10:00.800 --> 10:03.360
be causing an electrostatic
charge in the atmosphere?

10:03.436 --> 10:05.028
That's as good a guess as any.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.696
l can't explain it.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.740
We just can't transport.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.366
Fine, we'll take a shuttle.

10:19.518 --> 10:21.383
Once again, the storm
seems to have formed

10:21.454 --> 10:22.386
as a direct result

10:22.455 --> 10:24.116
of our interaction
with the atmosphere.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.385
The meteorological
conditions changed radically

10:26.459 --> 10:28.427
when we began
our entry sequence.

10:28.494 --> 10:30.394
Shields are holding.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.794
lt takes more
than a little thunderstorm

10:35.868 --> 10:38.996
to bother one of your mighty
Starfleet ships, huh?

10:39.071 --> 10:41.039
Nothing we can't handle.

10:41.107 --> 10:42.233
Relax, Neelix.

10:54.687 --> 10:57.247
That's why they call it
a rain forest.

11:00.026 --> 11:03.120
Why do your Sky Spirits
choose a place where it rains

11:03.229 --> 11:04.753
all the time?

11:04.797 --> 11:06.890
And it's hot...

11:06.966 --> 11:08.456
and there are so many bugs?

11:10.636 --> 11:14.072
lt's said the Sky Spirits
honored the land above all else.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.643
Maybe it's because this land

11:17.710 --> 11:20.372
yields so many
different kinds of life.

11:20.446 --> 11:24.109
Maybe they wanted us
to become friends

11:24.183 --> 11:25.980
with everything in nature.

11:26.052 --> 11:27.485
lncluding the bugs.

11:27.553 --> 11:28.577
Sorry, Sky Spirits.

11:28.654 --> 11:30.679
l will never make friends
with bugs.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.053
Maybe that's why
they keep biting you.

11:38.497 --> 11:39.794
You're miserable.

11:41.967 --> 11:44.458
lt was a mistake to bring you.
l'm sorry.

11:44.537 --> 11:49.065
l'm sorry l can't be
what you want me to be.

11:50.943 --> 11:53.537
From the day you came
out of your mother...

11:53.612 --> 11:55.603
upside down...

11:55.681 --> 11:59.242
l knew the spirits had
chosen you to be a contrary.

11:59.318 --> 12:01.149
No one chooses for me.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.313
l choose my own way.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.914
And if that makes me a contrary,

12:06.025 --> 12:07.652
l'll have to live with it.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.093
lf you have no spirits
to guide you,

12:10.162 --> 12:12.323
l fear you will lose your way.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.104
Altitude: 5,000 meters.

12:20.172 --> 12:22.970
Decreasing speed to 720 kph.

12:23.042 --> 12:25.670
Entering terminal
approach phase.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.406
Visibility still zero.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.505
Switching
to enhanced terrain scanning.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.573
Touchdown sight scanned.

12:31.650 --> 12:32.878
Continuing descent.

12:51.237 --> 12:54.934
Computer, activate the emergency
medical holographic program.

12:56.842 --> 12:59.037
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.442
l thought we changed
your program

13:00.513 --> 13:02.674
so you wouldn't have
to say that anymore.

13:02.748 --> 13:03.806
We did.

13:03.883 --> 13:06.351
But l became so uncomfortable
trying to find new ways

13:06.418 --> 13:10.184
to ''break the ice,'' as it were,
that l restored it.

13:10.256 --> 13:12.121
Let's just say it works for me.

13:13.159 --> 13:14.353
Doctor?

13:15.528 --> 13:17.462
Ah, you noticed.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.897
Are holograms
supposed to... sneeze?

13:20.966 --> 13:22.263
Generally, no.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.461
But l have accepted
your challenge.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.562
l programmed myself
with the symptoms

13:26.639 --> 13:28.231
of the 29-hour Levodian flu.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.275
Thus l will gain the experience

13:30.342 --> 13:31.969
that you suggest
would be beneficial

13:32.044 --> 13:33.477
to the performance of my duties.

13:36.115 --> 13:37.377
Holographic tissue paper

13:37.449 --> 13:39.110
for the holographic runny nose.

13:39.185 --> 13:40.709
Don't offer them to patients.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.990
Mmm, interesting sensation,
blowing one's nose.

13:46.058 --> 13:47.855
lt's my first time.

13:47.927 --> 13:50.987
l think this is
very brave of you.

13:51.096 --> 13:52.290
Nothing of the sort.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.992
l intend it to be
an educational experience.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.830
l'm sure you'll learn a lot.

13:56.902 --> 13:58.870
l meant for the crew.

13:58.938 --> 14:02.669
l'm tired of the whiny,
cranky attitudes

14:02.741 --> 14:03.867
we see around here.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.705
l intend to serve as an example
of how one's life and duties

14:06.779 --> 14:08.906
do not have to be disrupted
by simple illness.

14:08.981 --> 14:10.312
Doc?

14:10.382 --> 14:11.406
l don't feel so good.

14:11.483 --> 14:12.415
Neither do l,

14:12.484 --> 14:13.951
and you don't hear me
complaining.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.621
We are not making any progress
locating the source

14:24.697 --> 14:26.426
of that unusual power reading,
Commander.

14:27.766 --> 14:29.700
Then l guess we'll have
to search for these people

14:29.768 --> 14:31.599
the old-fashioned way--
with our eyes and ears.

14:31.670 --> 14:32.796
ls something bothering you,

14:32.872 --> 14:34.032
Commander?

14:34.106 --> 14:36.939
No, it just reminds me

14:37.009 --> 14:38.943
of another jungle
that l visited once.

14:39.011 --> 14:41.536
The Central American rain forest
on Earth.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.309
lt's the only other place
in the universe

14:43.382 --> 14:44.747
that l've ever seen this flower.

14:44.817 --> 14:48.218
lt appears to be
a rare variety of Cypriprdium

14:48.287 --> 14:50.346
of the Asiatic genus
PaphiopediIum.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.117
l never knew you had

14:52.191 --> 14:55.718
such horticultural
expertise, Mr. Vulcan.

14:55.794 --> 14:58.957
ln fact, l am--
or, more accurately, l was--

14:59.031 --> 15:00.931
a breeder of prize
Vulcan orchids.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.194
Then we have something
in common--

15:04.270 --> 15:05.237
l breed orchids, too!

15:07.172 --> 15:09.572
Don't they make
the most exquisite salad?

15:09.642 --> 15:12.543
A touch of Baldoxic vinegar--
pure heaven.

15:12.611 --> 15:14.476
l hereby designate
the two of you

15:14.546 --> 15:16.514
the team's botanical surveyors.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.140
Collect a sample
of that flower.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.208
B'Elanna?

15:20.286 --> 15:23.221
lt's just what we've
been looking for.

15:23.289 --> 15:24.779
Almost pure polyferranide.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.848
But there's a problem
with crust reactivity.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.393
lf we can't solve it
before excavation,

15:28.460 --> 15:30.655
we might contaminate
the entire yield.

15:30.729 --> 15:33.357
Have Ensign Kim run an
analysis from the ship.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.660
We should be able to...

15:35.701 --> 15:37.692
l'll be damned.

15:37.770 --> 15:38.828
What?

15:40.272 --> 15:42.797
lt almost looks like a hawk,
doesn't it?

15:45.711 --> 15:47.076
Listen to him, Chakotay.

15:48.247 --> 15:49.578
What does he say to you?

15:52.651 --> 15:55.620
He says, ''You are home.''
Huh?

15:57.656 --> 15:59.749
l'm leaving the tribe, Father.

15:59.825 --> 16:01.156
What?

16:01.260 --> 16:04.787
l got to know a lot
of the Starfleet officers

16:04.830 --> 16:06.821
patrolling
the Cardassian border.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.230
l asked Captain Sulu

16:08.300 --> 16:10.768
if he would sponsor me
at Starfleet Academy.

16:10.836 --> 16:11.996
And he would do such a thing

16:12.071 --> 16:13.561
without even
discussing it with me?

16:13.639 --> 16:16.267
l told him l had your approval.

16:16.342 --> 16:17.309
Ah!

16:17.376 --> 16:19.503
l kept him as far away
from you as l could.

16:20.579 --> 16:23.571
l take it you've been
accepted by the Academy.

16:28.454 --> 16:31.355
Well, you've never
fully embraced

16:31.423 --> 16:33.914
the traditions of our tribe,
l know that.

16:34.026 --> 16:36.460
And you've always been curious
about other societies.

16:36.528 --> 16:39.793
And that is why l allowed you
to read about them.

16:39.865 --> 16:43.562
Because l believe that ignorance
is our greatest enemy.

16:43.635 --> 16:45.899
But to leave the tribe...

16:45.971 --> 16:47.871
Our tribe lives in the past.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.567
A past of fantasy and myth.

16:49.641 --> 16:51.802
That past is a part of you,

16:51.877 --> 16:54.345
no matter how hard
you try to reject it.

16:54.413 --> 16:57.644
Other tribes have learned
to accept the 24th century.

16:57.716 --> 16:58.876
Why can't ours?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.954
lt is not the place
of a 15-year-old boy

17:04.022 --> 17:05.752
to question the choices
of his tribe.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.018
l know.

17:07.092 --> 17:08.423
That's why l have to leave.

17:08.493 --> 17:10.462
You will never belong
to that other life.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.327
And if you leave, you will
never belong to this one.

17:13.398 --> 17:15.731
You'll be caught between worlds.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.269
l ask for your blessing,
Father.

17:18.337 --> 17:20.099
Oon-day. Oon-day, KoIopak.

17:34.686 --> 17:37.883
Botanical surveyor number one
to Commander Chakotay.

17:37.956 --> 17:39.218
Go ahead, Neelix.

17:39.291 --> 17:40.918
You won't believe what l found.

17:41.026 --> 17:41.993
l think it's...

17:47.933 --> 17:48.922
Neelix, what the...?

17:49.001 --> 17:50.935
The bird, the bird!

18:02.815 --> 18:04.749
My eye!

18:04.817 --> 18:06.478
Away team to Voyager.

18:06.552 --> 18:07.484
Go ahead, Commander.

18:07.553 --> 18:08.986
Emergency beam-out.

18:09.054 --> 18:10.817
Get Neelix to Sick Bay.

18:10.889 --> 18:12.015
Acknowledged.

18:18.063 --> 18:19.223
Commander.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.635
You're very lucky this bird

19:01.740 --> 19:03.537
didn't snatch your eye
right out of the socket.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.940
We have no spare
Talaxian eyeballs.

19:07.012 --> 19:08.445
ls something
the matter with him?

19:08.514 --> 19:11.210
The Doctor gave himself
the Levodian flu

19:11.283 --> 19:12.443
to see what it's like.

19:12.518 --> 19:14.748
ls he contagious?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.651
lt's a holographic simulation,
not an actual virus.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.349
There's no need for concern.

19:19.391 --> 19:20.483
You may sit up.

19:21.860 --> 19:22.827
Touchy, isn't he?

19:22.895 --> 19:24.157
He isn't feeling well.

19:24.229 --> 19:27.824
l don't require any compassion,
thank you very much.

19:27.900 --> 19:32.633
l have been experiencing these
symptoms for nearly 20 hours,

19:32.704 --> 19:36.037
and l am in complete command
of my faculties.

19:37.809 --> 19:40.243
You may both leave now.

19:57.629 --> 19:59.654
Mr. Kim believes
if we bombard the crust

19:59.731 --> 20:01.096
with antithoron radiation,

20:01.166 --> 20:03.794
we can decontaminate it
before excavation begins.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.928
Then all we need to do
is locate these people

20:06.038 --> 20:07.198
and get their permission.

20:07.272 --> 20:08.603
Any progress?

20:08.674 --> 20:09.971
Everything we've found here

20:10.075 --> 20:12.373
suggests the people
who live in this village

20:12.444 --> 20:13.775
left recently and in a hurry.

20:13.845 --> 20:16.143
Do you believe our arrival
frightened them?

20:16.215 --> 20:17.409
We can't discount that.

20:17.482 --> 20:19.313
You'd think
with warp technology,

20:19.384 --> 20:21.648
they would have encountered
other alien life before now.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.085
You'd think

20:23.155 --> 20:24.986
with warp technology, they
wouldn't be living like this.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.525
Captain, have you had
any unusual readings

20:27.593 --> 20:30.994
that might explain the images of
a strange face l've been seeing?

20:31.063 --> 20:32.553
lmages?

20:32.631 --> 20:33.859
Very odd.

20:33.932 --> 20:35.661
Like the flash of a memory.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.759
But it's someone l've never met.

20:37.836 --> 20:40.964
Nothing unusual has shown up
on the ship's sensors.

20:41.039 --> 20:44.338
Tuvok hasn't detected
any telepathic activity, either.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.172
lf you want to call it a day,
Commander...

20:46.245 --> 20:47.177
No.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.043
l think we'll press on
for a while.

20:49.147 --> 20:51.411
lf there are any other problems,
l'll let you know.

20:51.483 --> 20:52.575
Chakotay out.

20:53.619 --> 20:56.247
The dwellings are constructed
with an alloy polymer matrix

20:56.321 --> 20:58.289
we've never encountered before,
Commander.

21:00.525 --> 21:01.924
They're out there.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.462
Our tricorders
may not tell us so,

21:04.529 --> 21:05.894
but they're out there.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.399
Lay down your weapons.

21:14.473 --> 21:15.440
Commander?

21:15.507 --> 21:17.441
Disarm-- l want them to see

21:17.509 --> 21:19.136
that we don't pose
any threat to them.

21:20.512 --> 21:23.413
May l remind the Commander
that Starfleet protocol demands

21:23.482 --> 21:24.915
that away teams remain armed

21:24.983 --> 21:27.349
and ready to defend themselves
until contact is...

21:27.419 --> 21:29.717
l know all about
Starfleet protocol, Lieutenant.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.484
As we have not yet established
the inhabitants' intentions,

21:32.557 --> 21:34.388
it would not be
a logical course of action.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.485
The logical course
isn't always the right course.

21:37.562 --> 21:39.462
Lay down your weapons
in plain sight.

21:39.531 --> 21:40.463
Those are my orders.

21:40.532 --> 21:41.624
Would you at least permit me

21:41.700 --> 21:43.224
to advise the Captain
to move the ship

21:43.302 --> 21:44.894
into a stronger
tactical position?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.164
Negative.

21:46.238 --> 21:48.206
We'll show no force of any kind.

21:49.508 --> 21:53.376
For the record, l must take
exception to these orders.

21:53.445 --> 21:55.140
Noted.

22:02.020 --> 22:04.488
They have reason to be scared.

22:04.556 --> 22:06.421
Who can blame them?

22:06.491 --> 22:11.292
Their history, our history,
is filled with conquerors

22:11.363 --> 22:13.593
who brought slavery
and disease and death.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.599
Maybe we should
just leave them alone.

22:15.667 --> 22:22.971
Oh-chip way-nob-ee
teem-mock-uh an-tope-ah-nee.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.600
Hi-yeta-koo-nay-pas.

22:25.677 --> 22:30.239
Cha-kan-a hi-mee.
Cha-kan-a hi-mee.

22:30.315 --> 22:32.875
Duh su kan-nuh-da.

22:34.786 --> 22:35.878
Binda kana.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.090
Binda kana.

22:46.264 --> 22:47.629
Father.

23:03.415 --> 23:05.440
Kah-yo-tay. Hay-noh.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.463
CHAH-mooz-ee.

24:40.679 --> 24:42.943
Teem-ma-ka-ha.

25:25.423 --> 25:27.789
l have no explanation,
Commander!

25:27.859 --> 25:30.384
There is no storm activity
indicated.

25:30.462 --> 25:32.862
All right, let's get back
to the shuttle.

25:48.914 --> 25:51.314
Hey! Wait!

25:58.456 --> 26:00.151
We will never make it!

26:00.225 --> 26:01.658
Where's Chakotay?!

26:01.726 --> 26:03.557
Away team to Voyager.

26:03.628 --> 26:05.027
Emergency beam-out.

26:24.182 --> 26:25.149
He was right behind us.

26:25.216 --> 26:27.150
l don't understand
what could have happened to him.

26:27.218 --> 26:29.652
Was he wearing the combadge
the last time you saw him?

26:29.721 --> 26:30.915
Just before the storm,
he was using it

26:30.989 --> 26:32.081
to speak with you, Captain.

26:32.157 --> 26:34.318
Mr. Paris, what are the current
surface conditions

26:34.392 --> 26:35.324
near the shuttle?

26:35.393 --> 26:37.486
Surface conditions are
back to normal, Captain.

26:37.562 --> 26:39.928
Winds two knots, but...

26:39.998 --> 26:41.659
l can't find any sign
of their shuttle.

26:41.733 --> 26:43.530
lt's not where they landed it.

26:43.602 --> 26:44.830
And it isn't airborne?

26:44.903 --> 26:46.131
No, ma'am.

26:46.204 --> 26:47.171
l'll lead the away team back.

26:47.238 --> 26:48.569
Mr. Tuvok, Lieutenant,
you're with me.

26:48.640 --> 26:49.937
Mr. Paris, you have...

26:50.008 --> 26:51.976
Captain Janeway,
this is the Doctor.

26:52.043 --> 26:55.137
Please turn to your emergency
medical holographic channel.

26:57.749 --> 26:59.216
What is it, Doctor?

26:59.284 --> 27:01.115
Something terrible has happened.

27:01.219 --> 27:02.151
My program...

27:03.855 --> 27:05.345
Doctor, l think you're carrying

27:05.423 --> 27:08.017
this experiment of yours
a little too far.

27:08.093 --> 27:10.823
One hour too far, to be precise.

27:10.895 --> 27:14.592
l very specifically programmed
a 29-hour Levodian flu.

27:14.666 --> 27:17.533
And it has now been 30 hours.

27:17.602 --> 27:19.661
Doctor, l'm sorry, but we have
more pressing matters...

27:19.738 --> 27:20.796
You can't leave me like this.

27:20.872 --> 27:22.840
l need help, now!

27:22.907 --> 27:24.272
Get me somebody
who can tweak the computer

27:24.342 --> 27:25.809
and make me feel better,
immediately.

27:28.580 --> 27:29.547
Very well.

27:30.582 --> 27:32.209
Mr. Kim is on his way.

27:32.283 --> 27:33.682
Try to relax, Doctor.

27:33.752 --> 27:35.583
l'll see to that, Captain.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.053
l'm going to need you
with me, Kes.

27:37.122 --> 27:38.680
Prepare a medkit
and bring it with you

27:38.757 --> 27:39.689
to Transporter Room 3.

27:39.758 --> 27:41.157
Commander Chakotay
is still on the surface

27:41.226 --> 27:42.158
and may be injured.

27:42.227 --> 27:43.159
Janeway out.

27:46.431 --> 27:49.366
Oh, l don't understand it.

27:49.434 --> 27:52.597
l... l ran
a computer diagnostic

27:52.671 --> 27:56.232
and it said
that my program was fine.

27:56.307 --> 27:58.673
Just rest, Doctor.

27:59.944 --> 28:02.276
Here's a cool,
holographic towel

28:02.380 --> 28:03.608
for your forehead.

28:03.648 --> 28:04.706
Oh, thank you.

28:04.783 --> 28:05.750
Thank you so much.

28:05.817 --> 28:07.478
Please...

28:07.552 --> 28:08.610
don't go yet.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.847
l have to.
The Captain...

28:09.921 --> 28:13.823
l feel like l'm fading,
just... fading away.

28:13.892 --> 28:15.860
You don't know what that means
to a hologram.

28:15.927 --> 28:17.588
What seems to be the problem?

28:18.830 --> 28:24.166
My simulated virus is leading me
to a simulated death.

28:24.235 --> 28:25.202
lt's nothing to worry about.

28:25.270 --> 28:27.534
l just added a couple of hours
to his computer program.

28:27.605 --> 28:31.371
He'll be fine
in about 45 minutes.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.037
Knowing when it would end

28:34.112 --> 28:36.876
didn't exactly make it
a fair test, did it, Doctor?

28:45.356 --> 28:50.123
Oh, she is far more devious
than l ever suspected.

29:39.177 --> 29:41.008
No shuttle.

29:41.079 --> 29:43.411
Well, at least
they got out okay.

30:03.735 --> 30:05.965
You have nothing
to fear from me.

30:07.739 --> 30:09.468
Talk to me.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.872
Let me see you.

31:06.831 --> 31:08.765
Is-to ko-hee-nis.

31:08.833 --> 31:10.061
No!

31:10.134 --> 31:11.328
Thank you.

31:49.340 --> 31:52.070
You have nothing
to fear from me.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.243
Talk to me.

31:56.247 --> 31:57.680
Let me see you.

32:19.804 --> 32:20.793
l don't understand it.

32:20.872 --> 32:22.032
lt's the same thing
that happened

32:22.106 --> 32:23.437
the first time
we tried to go down.

32:23.508 --> 32:26.170
A storm develops wherever
we try to lock on.

32:26.244 --> 32:27.541
Why would we have the ability

32:27.612 --> 32:29.739
to beam people up,
but not to beam them down?

32:29.814 --> 32:30.872
l believe

32:30.949 --> 32:33.281
we have seen enough
to discern a pattern, Captain.

32:33.351 --> 32:34.682
The logical conclusion is

32:34.752 --> 32:36.617
that someone is controlling
the elements of nature

32:36.688 --> 32:37.882
to ward us off.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.618
The transporter anomaly is
evidence of this conclusion.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.660
We are allowed
to leave the planet,

32:42.727 --> 32:43.785
but not to approach.

32:43.861 --> 32:45.488
lf that's true, l'd be happy

32:45.563 --> 32:47.895
to respect their wishes,
but, unfortunately,

32:47.966 --> 32:50.196
l have a missing crewman
to get back first.

32:50.268 --> 32:51.292
Janeway to Paris.

32:51.369 --> 32:52.631
Yes, Captain.

32:52.704 --> 32:54.638
Mr. Paris, we're going to land
Voyager on the surface.

32:54.706 --> 32:56.037
Take us into the atmosphere.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.040
Acknowledged.

32:58.109 --> 32:59.599
Beginning entry sequence.

33:11.389 --> 33:13.653
l'm reading electrical storms
forming all around us.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.522
Adjusting flight path.

33:15.593 --> 33:18.357
The barometric pressure
is continuing to fall.

33:18.429 --> 33:21.125
We're looking
at monsoon conditions out there.

34:02.306 --> 34:04.001
Mr. Paris, the shuttle crew
didn't report

34:04.075 --> 34:05.906
turbulence this severe
during their landing.

34:06.010 --> 34:07.534
l'm doing the best l can,
Captain.

34:07.612 --> 34:10.206
l'm showing gale force
winds out there.

34:10.281 --> 34:11.646
lt is conceivable
that the aliens

34:11.716 --> 34:13.513
have been able
to intensify their response

34:13.583 --> 34:15.643
now that they are familiar
with our capabilities.

34:16.821 --> 34:17.844
Red Alert!

34:17.922 --> 34:19.822
lnertial dampers are off-line.

34:21.125 --> 34:22.853
We seem to be caught
in some kind of vortex.

34:22.927 --> 34:25.225
l can't maintain altitude.

34:25.295 --> 34:26.422
Captain, it's a cyclone.

34:39.976 --> 34:41.739
Altitude 20,000 meters
and falling.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.940
l can't get us out
of this thing, Captain.

34:44.014 --> 34:44.947
Bridge to Torres.

34:45.016 --> 34:46.949
We need more power
from the engines.

34:47.018 --> 34:48.985
l've got them running 20 percent
over rated maximum, Captain.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.714
lt's not enough.

34:50.788 --> 34:52.755
Could we go to low warp
under these conditions?

34:52.824 --> 34:54.882
The ship might make it
without inertial dampers,

34:54.958 --> 34:57.325
but we'd all just be stains
on the back wall.

34:58.529 --> 34:59.996
l can try to augment the engines

35:00.031 --> 35:02.124
with power from the auxiliary
fusion reactors,

35:02.166 --> 35:04.157
but it's going to take
at least 20 minutes.

35:04.235 --> 35:06.294
How much time do we have,
Mr. Paris?

35:06.370 --> 35:08.395
Altitude at 18,000 meters
and falling.

35:08.473 --> 35:10.907
At this rate, we're looking
at about ten minutes.

35:37.502 --> 35:39.527
lf you can hear me, speak to me.

35:44.242 --> 35:46.267
Dosh-du-pah kee-ne?

35:46.344 --> 35:50.246
Swasge-muh kee-say-yo-pah?

35:50.314 --> 35:51.906
Swas-ti-ma-hay.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.746
Kee-say-yo-pah.

35:53.818 --> 35:57.811
Pah-kee-ne?
Sas-ga no-yo-du no-kay-dah?

35:57.889 --> 35:59.823
l'm sorry.

35:59.891 --> 36:02.792
l don't know the ancient
language of my people.

36:02.894 --> 36:05.419
l can't understand.

36:05.463 --> 36:08.728
Po-kud-zee yo-atah.

36:08.799 --> 36:10.699
Pon-tez-butz-su.

36:19.210 --> 36:20.438
A CHAH-mooz-ee.

36:21.979 --> 36:23.810
CHAH-mooz-ee.

36:25.149 --> 36:28.482
Swasge-muh kee-say.

36:30.755 --> 36:33.656
Yo-pah no-kay-dah?

36:42.333 --> 36:44.096
CHAH-mooz-ee.

36:54.612 --> 36:56.603
Altitude 6,000 meters.

36:56.681 --> 36:59.878
Warning. Approach vector
is too steep.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.942
Discontinue landing sequence.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.385
Would somebody
turn that off, please?

37:04.422 --> 37:05.616
Engineering, report.

37:05.690 --> 37:07.954
We need that extra power,
B'Elanna.

37:08.025 --> 37:09.788
Ten minutes.

37:09.860 --> 37:12.829
l just need ten minutes!

37:22.373 --> 37:24.807
Do you understand my words now?

37:26.177 --> 37:27.144
Yes.

37:27.211 --> 37:29.475
Explain the face marking.

37:29.547 --> 37:32.072
l wear it to honor my father.

37:32.149 --> 37:34.617
He wore it
to honor his ancestors.

37:34.685 --> 37:36.619
Ancestors...

37:36.687 --> 37:37.915
You are human?

37:38.022 --> 37:38.920
Yes.

37:39.023 --> 37:41.856
Are there others
on your world with this mark?

37:41.926 --> 37:42.915
Yes.

37:42.994 --> 37:44.723
Not many, but some.

37:44.795 --> 37:46.922
We were taught all of them
had been annihilated.

37:47.031 --> 37:50.296
We were taught
your world had been ravaged

37:50.368 --> 37:53.826
by those with no respect
for life or land.

37:53.904 --> 37:56.338
There was a time
when that was true.

37:56.407 --> 37:58.170
But no longer.

37:59.310 --> 38:02.143
He claims to be a descendent
of the lnheritors.

38:03.247 --> 38:04.509
lnheritors?

38:08.786 --> 38:12.153
The ones...
our ancestors chose to honor.

38:12.223 --> 38:14.851
l'm surprised you have no memory

38:14.925 --> 38:16.859
of the lnheritors.

38:16.927 --> 38:19.760
One of our gifts
was the memory.

38:19.830 --> 38:23.197
lf you are a descendent,
you should remember.

38:25.169 --> 38:27.967
l'm not sure l understand.

38:28.039 --> 38:31.031
Perhaps it has
been lost over time.

38:34.345 --> 38:36.813
45,000 years ago,

38:36.881 --> 38:39.645
on our first visit
to your world,

38:39.717 --> 38:42.618
we met a small group
of nomadic hunters.

38:42.687 --> 38:44.814
They had no spoken language,

38:44.889 --> 38:48.723
no culture, except the use
of fire and stone weapons,

38:48.793 --> 38:51.921
but they did have
a respect for the land

38:52.029 --> 38:56.796
and for other living creatures
that impressed us deeply.

38:56.867 --> 38:59.199
We decided
to give them an inheritance--

38:59.270 --> 39:01.067
a genetic bonding--

39:01.172 --> 39:04.608
so they might thrive
and protect your world.

39:04.642 --> 39:08.203
On subsequent visits,
we found that our genetic gift

39:08.279 --> 39:11.510
brought about a spirit
of curiosity and adventure.

39:11.582 --> 39:14.415
lt impelled them to migrate
away from the cold climate

39:14.485 --> 39:17.079
to a new, unpeopled land.

39:17.154 --> 39:18.951
lt took them almost
a thousand generations

39:19.023 --> 39:20.684
to cross your planet.

39:20.758 --> 39:23.852
Hundreds of thousands of them
flourished in their new land.

39:23.928 --> 39:25.987
Their civilization
had a profound influence

39:26.063 --> 39:28.088
on others of your species.

39:28.165 --> 39:31.225
But then new people came
with weapons

39:31.302 --> 39:32.963
and disease.

39:34.972 --> 39:37.805
The lnheritors who survived
scattered.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.400
Many sought refuge
in other societies.

39:40.478 --> 39:42.776
12 generations ago
when we returned,

39:42.847 --> 39:45.577
we found no sign
of their existence.

39:45.649 --> 39:49.676
My people called you
the Sky Spirits.

39:52.356 --> 39:55.587
Why have you been hiding from us
since we landed here?

39:55.659 --> 39:57.593
When we heard your message,

39:57.661 --> 40:01.119
who you were, observed
you probing our land,

40:01.198 --> 40:03.428
we believed you were a threat.

40:03.501 --> 40:05.526
We thought you
would annihilate us

40:05.603 --> 40:06.729
as you had the lnheritors.

40:06.804 --> 40:10.103
Our message was supposed to
communicate peaceful intentions.

40:10.174 --> 40:12.142
We were taught that is the way

40:12.209 --> 40:14.973
human conquerors
often introduce themselves.

40:15.079 --> 40:17.513
As l said...

40:17.581 --> 40:19.310
we've tried to change our ways

40:19.383 --> 40:21.408
since the last time
you stopped by.

40:25.222 --> 40:26.985
Altitude: 2,000 meters.

40:27.057 --> 40:28.285
Stand by, Bridge.

40:28.359 --> 40:30.793
We're initiating
the transfer now.

40:30.861 --> 40:33.591
l'm showing an eight percent
boost in the engines.

40:33.664 --> 40:35.427
That's all?

40:35.499 --> 40:36.989
The fusion reactors
are nearly drained.

40:37.067 --> 40:39.558
Fighting the storm is taking
every reserve we have.

40:39.637 --> 40:41.434
Altitude: 1,000 meters.

40:41.505 --> 40:43.234
lmpact in 20 seconds.

40:43.307 --> 40:44.638
B'Elanna.

40:46.243 --> 40:48.143
lmpact in 15 seconds.

40:48.212 --> 40:51.272
l'm sorry, Captain,
that's all we've got.

40:54.385 --> 40:56.114
lmpact in ten seconds.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.057
Report.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.925
We're free.

41:06.030 --> 41:07.554
Gaining altitude.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.895
2,000 meters.

41:09.967 --> 41:13.095
2,500.
Dampers back on line.

41:13.170 --> 41:16.105
The storms have
completely dissipated.

41:16.173 --> 41:19.233
There's not a cloud in the sky.

41:23.347 --> 41:24.939
Stand down Red Alert.

41:25.015 --> 41:28.212
Anybody have an explanation?

41:28.285 --> 41:29.809
lt appears the inhabitants
of this planet

41:29.887 --> 41:31.548
have decided to make contact,
Captain.

41:31.622 --> 41:33.715
The cloaking device
has been turned off,

41:33.791 --> 41:36.692
and we are showing
an alien population.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.853
l have located the shuttle.

41:38.929 --> 41:40.988
lt may be possible
to locate Commander Chakotay

41:41.065 --> 41:42.191
without landing.

41:43.601 --> 41:45.660
Establish a search pattern,
Mr. Paris.

41:45.736 --> 41:46.668
Yes, Captain.

41:46.737 --> 41:48.261
Begin scanning
for human life signs.

41:48.339 --> 41:51.934
As soon as you find Chakotay,
we'll send down an away team.

41:56.447 --> 41:58.642
My ship will be coming
for me soon.

41:58.716 --> 42:00.911
l'm sorry we cannot permit you

42:01.018 --> 42:03.851
to extract all the materials
you need.

42:03.888 --> 42:07.051
You were generous
to offer as much as you did.

42:08.692 --> 42:10.592
You have a long journey ahead.

42:10.661 --> 42:13.027
lt took us
more than two generations

42:13.097 --> 42:15.395
to reach your world.

42:21.238 --> 42:23.900
l wish l could see
my father's face right now.

42:23.974 --> 42:25.805
Does he still live?

42:27.745 --> 42:29.007
No.

42:31.181 --> 42:32.512
He died fighting enemies

42:32.583 --> 42:34.574
who would have
taken our home colony.

42:34.652 --> 42:37.621
Our tribe moved there
a few hundred years ago.

42:37.688 --> 42:42.387
So he honored the land
just as... his ancestors did.

42:44.395 --> 42:45.919
Yes.

42:45.996 --> 42:47.588
Yes, he did.

42:51.201 --> 42:54.659
We weren't on very good terms
when he died.

42:54.738 --> 42:56.763
Once he was gone, l didn't know

42:56.840 --> 42:59.001
how to reconcile
our differences,

42:59.076 --> 43:01.306
how to heal our old wounds.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.107
l returned to my colony,

43:03.147 --> 43:05.411
and continued the fight
in his name.

43:05.482 --> 43:09.248
l took the mark that he wore
to honor his ancestors.

43:09.320 --> 43:12.551
l spoke to him
in my vision quests,

43:12.623 --> 43:15.820
but he never answered.

43:15.893 --> 43:17.690
Until now.

43:38.882 --> 43:40.577
CHAH-mooz-ee.

43:45.422 --> 43:46.184
Commander.

43:51.495 --> 43:53.292
Put those away.

44:14.218 --> 44:17.483
Listen to him, Chakotay.

44:17.554 --> 44:20.284
Do you hear
what he says to you?

44:20.357 --> 44:22.450
Yes, Father.

44:22.526 --> 44:23.823
l hear him.

44:26.530 --> 44:28.395
l finally hear him.

44:46.016 --> 44:47.847
Four to beam up, Voyager.

44:48.305 --> 44:54.326
