01:08.587 --> 01:11.852
When I start out
to make a fool of myself...

01:12.090 --> 01:14.422
...there´s very little can stop me.

01:14.860 --> 01:18.591
If I´d known where it would end,
I´d have never let anything start.

01:18.830 --> 01:21.162
If I´d been in my right mind, that is.

01:21.399 --> 01:25.358
But once I´d seen her...

01:25.604 --> 01:29.700
...I was not in my right
mind for quite some time.

01:33.411 --> 01:38.075
"Good evening," said I,
thinking myself a very gay dog indeed.

01:38.316 --> 01:40.307
But here was a beautiful girl...

01:40.552 --> 01:43.749
...and me with plenty of
time to get myself into trouble.

01:44.156 --> 01:47.125
Some people can smell danger.

01:47.359 --> 01:48.348
Not me.

01:48.593 --> 01:50.993
I asked her
if she´d have a cigarette.

01:51.229 --> 01:54.164
It´s me last one,
so please don´t disappoint me.

01:54.399 --> 01:55.764
But I don´t smoke.

02:11.583 --> 02:13.073
That´s how I found her.

02:13.318 --> 02:17.687
And from that moment on,
I did not use my head very much...

02:17.923 --> 02:20.187
...except to be thinking of her.

02:21.993 --> 02:24.154
But in the park in those days...

02:24.396 --> 02:27.957
...the rough young fellas
used to be staging holdups.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.361
Help! Help!

02:31.436 --> 02:33.870
These young fellas
were not professionals.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.298
That´s the reason...

02:36.541 --> 02:41.308
...why I start out in
this story a little bit like a hero.

02:41.713 --> 02:43.806
Which I most certainly am not.

03:04.469 --> 03:06.403
The cabdriver
woke up, he was okay...

03:06.638 --> 03:09.573
...so I borrowed his
carriage to drive the lady home.

03:09.808 --> 03:12.777
In a while she recovered
herself and brightened up...

03:13.011 --> 03:16.970
...what with the things I told
her to get her mind off the scare...

03:17.215 --> 03:21.618
...and to set her thinking as well of
the brave fella that had rescued her.

03:21.987 --> 03:23.454
Rosalie.

03:23.688 --> 03:27.055
Fair Rosalie. It´s a name
I´m after calling you. Why not?

03:27.292 --> 03:29.886
It´s a gorgeous, romantic
little name entirely.

03:30.128 --> 03:32.790
-I´m Michael, a poor sailor...
-You´re a character.

03:33.031 --> 03:37.297
...with the princess of
Central Park riding along at his side.

03:37.535 --> 03:41.767
I want to know where
does the princess come from?

03:42.340 --> 03:44.672
I don´t know why
she should tell you but...

03:45.844 --> 03:50.338
Well, her parents
were Russian, quite Russian.

03:50.582 --> 03:52.277
You never heard of the place she´s from.

03:52.517 --> 03:56.351
-Would Your Highness care to gamble?
-She´s done it for a living.

03:56.588 --> 03:59.022
I bet you I´ve been
to the place you were born.

03:59.257 --> 04:01.350
-Cheefoo.
-It's on the China coast.

04:01.593 --> 04:03.083
It´s the second wickedest city.

04:03.328 --> 04:05.296
-What´s the first?
-Macao.

04:05.530 --> 04:08.431
-I worked there.
-You worked in Macao?

04:08.667 --> 04:12.034
Here´s your dollar. How
about Shanghai? I worked there too.

04:12.270 --> 04:13.965
-As a gambler?
-Well...

04:14.205 --> 04:16.435
Hope you were luckier than tonight.

04:17.541 --> 04:19.942
You need more than luck in Shanghai.

04:20.178 --> 04:21.440
-Do you know what?
-What?

04:21.680 --> 04:24.945
I bet I could drive the cart
from down there inside with you.

04:26.184 --> 04:28.379
There´s a police
car on the other road.

04:28.620 --> 04:32.386
We best get out of the park. It´s
too simple for the cops to find us.

04:32.624 --> 04:33.750
You don´t like them.

04:33.992 --> 04:37.428
The cops struggle along
without our doing their work for them.

04:40.865 --> 04:44.323
Watch where you´re going!
Get that nag out of here!

04:46.671 --> 04:48.935
Now the cops are bound to pick us up.

04:49.174 --> 04:51.404
We´d best leave the cab here and walk.

04:51.643 --> 04:53.804
-You don´t like the police.
-I do not.

04:54.045 --> 04:56.536
My car´s right there
in the garage, anyway.

04:58.750 --> 05:02.777
Tell me, Michael, is there some
reason why the police don´t like you?

05:03.021 --> 05:06.479
Well, they never
put me in jail in America.

05:06.725 --> 05:10.456
You know, the nicest jails are in
Australia, the worst are in Spain.

05:10.695 --> 05:12.822
What law did you break in Spain?

05:13.064 --> 05:14.725
I killed a man.

05:17.402 --> 05:19.529
Just now you almost killed a girl.

05:19.771 --> 05:21.136
Is there a law against that?

05:21.373 --> 05:23.034
Try it, you won´t like the jails.

05:23.274 --> 05:26.072
They put you in jail for murder?
I didn´t think so.

05:26.311 --> 05:28.506
A man killed his
wife in Frisco last week.

05:28.747 --> 05:31.045
She´d gone to the icebox for supper.

05:31.282 --> 05:35.981
He thought she was a burglar, he said.
He shot her five times in the head.

05:36.354 --> 05:39.187
-He had a good lawyer.
-Evidently. I saw his picture.

05:39.424 --> 05:40.857
-Bainbridge.
-Bannister.

05:41.092 --> 05:44.926
Arthur Bannister. It said he´s
the world´s greatest criminal lawyer.

05:45.163 --> 05:47.393
-Some people think he is.
-Here´s your car.

05:48.833 --> 05:50.266
Send the bill to my husband.

05:52.604 --> 05:56.938
If you´re a sailor, there´s a job for
you. Would you like to work for me?

05:58.843 --> 06:00.208
I´d like it.

06:06.718 --> 06:08.652
I´m shipping out tomorrow.

06:08.887 --> 06:11.913
So are we! To the West
Coast, by way of the Canal.

06:12.157 --> 06:14.057
We´re short a man on the crew.

06:20.031 --> 06:21.896
I´ll make it worth your while.

06:24.335 --> 06:26.303
Could it be this you´re looking for?

06:27.338 --> 06:31.399
You were smart to carry
a gun, traveling alone in the park...

06:31.643 --> 06:36.171
...but if you knew you had the gun
in your bag, why throw away the bag?

06:37.148 --> 06:40.675
I meant for you to find it.
I don´t know how to shoot.

06:40.919 --> 06:42.147
It´s easy.

06:42.987 --> 06:44.716
You just pull the trigger.

06:55.533 --> 06:57.694
Some dame, ain´t she?

06:57.936 --> 07:00.461
Yeah. And some car.

07:00.705 --> 07:02.730
Evening, Mr. Grisby.

07:04.709 --> 07:07.473
Mr. Bannister sent it
all the way from San Francisco.

07:07.712 --> 07:09.111
So she could have it here.

07:09.347 --> 07:11.781
-Bannister?
-Arthur Bannister, himself.

07:12.016 --> 07:15.975
Gee, some guys have all the luck.

07:16.988 --> 07:20.685
Personally, I don´t like
a girlfriend to have a husband.

07:20.925 --> 07:24.122
If she´ll fool a husband,
I figure she´ll fool me.

07:24.362 --> 07:26.956
New York is not as big
as it pretends to be...

07:27.198 --> 07:30.326
...so I spent the next
day in the hiring hall...

07:30.568 --> 07:32.195
...waiting for a ship.

07:32.437 --> 07:35.235
That way, big boob that I am...

07:36.074 --> 07:37.507
...I thought I could escape her.

07:37.742 --> 07:39.403
S.S. American Trader...

07:39.644 --> 07:42.545
Cigarettes will stunt
your growth. Come here!

07:42.780 --> 07:44.441
Excuse me.

07:44.682 --> 07:49.016
I wonder if you could
help me locate a Mr. O´Hara.

07:49.254 --> 07:50.312
Michael O´Hara.

07:50.555 --> 07:52.045
Mike O´Hara?

07:52.357 --> 07:54.655
You mean Black Irish that talks fancy?

07:54.893 --> 07:57.691
-I don´t know him myself but...
-Black Irish?

07:57.929 --> 08:02.628
Yeah, I know him. Joe, call Mike
O´Hara, a guy here wants to see him.

08:02.867 --> 08:05.836
Michael O´Hara, please
step to the bulletin board.

08:06.070 --> 08:08.004
A man wants to see you.

08:08.473 --> 08:11.067
-Shipmates?
-We was in Spain together.

08:11.609 --> 08:15.943
They started calling him Black Irish
after what he did to finks back in ´39.

08:16.181 --> 08:19.309
Mike´s got blarney, but he
can hurt a man when he gets mad.

08:21.186 --> 08:22.881
You were asking for me?

08:24.155 --> 08:26.146
-O´Hara?
-O´Hara.

08:26.658 --> 08:28.819
You´re what they call
an able-bodied seaman?

08:29.060 --> 08:30.391
That´s what they call it.

08:30.628 --> 08:33.119
-You ever work on a yacht?
-No.

08:33.364 --> 08:36.890
-I presume you can handle a speedboat.
-I presume so.

08:37.135 --> 08:38.328
Do you drink?

08:39.102 --> 08:40.160
I beg your pardon?

08:40.405 --> 08:42.168
I asked you if you drink.

08:43.341 --> 08:47.300
Whatever´s set in front of me. Doesn´t
have to be wholesome, just strong.

08:49.113 --> 08:50.410
Do you drink habitually?

08:50.648 --> 08:53.481
May I ask, mister,
if you´re extending an invitation?

08:57.288 --> 08:59.449
I guess it might as well be.

08:59.691 --> 09:01.921
If you´ll show me to the nearest bar...

09:02.160 --> 09:05.152
...we´ll sit down and
discuss your coming to work for me.

09:05.396 --> 09:07.023
My name is Bannister.

09:08.132 --> 09:09.565
Bannister.

09:11.970 --> 09:14.370
Me boys, may I present
Mr. Arthur Bannister.

09:14.606 --> 09:17.074
The world´s greatest criminal lawyer.

09:17.308 --> 09:19.799
-This is Jake Bjoronson and...
-Hi.

09:20.044 --> 09:20.840
...Goldie, right?

09:21.079 --> 09:22.137
Hi, I´m Goldfish...

09:22.380 --> 09:26.840
Mr. Bannister´s wife sent him to get
me, isn´t that right, Mr. Bannister?

09:27.785 --> 09:31.277
Now, Mr. Bannister is
gonna buy us all a few drinks...

09:31.522 --> 09:35.288
...while I entertain myself
by refusing to go to work for him.

09:45.370 --> 09:48.635
You know, Mike saved my wife´s life.

09:49.841 --> 09:54.403
Here, would you mind
inserting these coins? Number four.

09:54.646 --> 09:56.375
That´s all we like to hear.

10:00.518 --> 10:02.679
Mike´s quite a hero.

10:03.855 --> 10:06.449
Quite a tough guy.

10:06.691 --> 10:09.489
Mister, there ain´t no such thing.

10:10.828 --> 10:12.659
No such thing as...

10:14.032 --> 10:15.124
...tough guy?

10:15.600 --> 10:17.192
What´s a tough guy?

10:19.871 --> 10:21.304
I don´t know.

10:21.539 --> 10:23.803
A guy with an edge.

10:24.042 --> 10:26.772
What makes him sing better
than me? Something in here.

10:27.011 --> 10:30.344
What makes it loud?
A microphone. That´s his edge.

10:30.581 --> 10:33.209
-Edge?
-A gun, a nightstick or a razor.

10:33.451 --> 10:35.248
Something the other guy ain´t got.

10:35.486 --> 10:39.889
An extra reach on a punch, instead of
brass knuckles, a stripe on a sleeve...

10:40.124 --> 10:42.957
...a badge that says "cop"
on it, a rock in your hand...

10:43.194 --> 10:45.492
...or a bankroll in your pocket.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.357
That´s an edge, brother.

10:47.598 --> 10:51.295
Without an edge,
there ain´t no tough guy.

10:51.969 --> 10:55.405
-You hear that, Black Irish?
-It's true.

10:55.640 --> 10:56.800
Well...

10:58.176 --> 11:00.007
...bear it in mind.

11:04.649 --> 11:07.584
Yeah, but what makes
him sing prettier than you?

11:10.621 --> 11:14.352
Naturally, someone
had to take Mr. Bannister home.

11:14.592 --> 11:17.493
I told myself
I couldn´t leave a helpless man...

11:17.729 --> 11:20.493
...lying unconscious in a saloon.

11:20.732 --> 11:23.667
Well, it was me
that was unconscious...

11:23.901 --> 11:28.634
...and he was exactly
as helpless as a sleeping rattlesnake.

11:31.042 --> 11:35.877
Say, it´s nice of you, Michael, to
be so nice to me while I was so drunk.

11:47.258 --> 11:48.589
Lover!

11:48.826 --> 11:50.191
I wasn´t sure you´d come.

11:50.695 --> 11:51.992
I´m not staying.

11:53.097 --> 11:55.088
You´ve got to stay.

11:55.433 --> 11:57.424
Lover!

12:00.905 --> 12:02.873
It´s gonna be a real nice cruise.

12:03.107 --> 12:05.905
First, the Panama Canal,
then up the Mexican coast.

12:06.310 --> 12:09.746
We need a boatswain,
Danny-boy. Ever done any sailing?

12:09.981 --> 12:12.506
A bit of it. I saw you
last night at the garage.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.342
Somebody else, Danny-boy.

12:14.652 --> 12:15.778
Not me.

12:16.020 --> 12:16.987
Don´t go.

12:17.221 --> 12:18.848
She needs you bad.

12:19.090 --> 12:20.022
You stay.

12:20.258 --> 12:24.092
If you play your cards right,
we can get a job for the both of us.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.023
I think we´ll take it.

12:36.474 --> 12:40.968
And what was I, Mike
O´Hara, doing on a luxury yacht...

12:41.212 --> 12:44.272
...pleasure-cruising
in the sunny Caribbean Sea?

12:44.749 --> 12:47.775
Well, it´s clear now,
I was chasing a married woman.

12:48.352 --> 12:51.446
But that´s not the way
I wanted to look at it. No.

12:51.689 --> 12:55.523
To be a real prize
fathead like Mike O´Hara...

12:55.760 --> 13:00.561
...you´ve got to swallow all the lies
you can think up to tell yourself.

13:05.503 --> 13:08.666
Our little expedition spent
some weeks in the West Indies.

13:08.906 --> 13:12.637
Dawdling around, seeing
the sights, laying in supplies...

13:12.877 --> 13:15.937
...and getting into more trouble.

13:48.746 --> 13:49.610
Hi!

13:49.847 --> 13:52.441
Hi, onboard the Cerce!

13:52.817 --> 13:54.307
You there!

13:55.887 --> 13:57.912
Why don´t you go swimming?

13:59.357 --> 14:00.949
I beg your pardon?

14:01.926 --> 14:04.394
I say, why don´t you go swimming?

14:04.629 --> 14:07.223
I didn´t bring a swimming
suit along on the job, sir.

14:07.465 --> 14:08.727
You ought to the next time.

14:08.966 --> 14:10.934
There won´t be
a next time. I´m quitting.

14:11.636 --> 14:13.069
My trunks ought to fit you.

14:13.304 --> 14:14.896
You´ll find them in the locker.

14:15.139 --> 14:17.232
I suppose you´re wondering who I am.

14:17.475 --> 14:18.772
I saw you in New York.

14:19.010 --> 14:21.274
I flew in this morning,
by way of Havana.

14:21.512 --> 14:24.140
I´m George Grisby, you know.
Grisby & Bannister.

14:24.382 --> 14:27.010
-Where is everybody, gone ashore?
-Almost everybody.

14:27.251 --> 14:29.082
My partner too? Mr. Bannister?

14:29.320 --> 14:30.048
That´s right.

14:30.721 --> 14:31.915
And the lady?

14:32.657 --> 14:33.988
Oh...

14:41.799 --> 14:44.859
Mr. Bannister tells me
you once killed a man.

14:45.202 --> 14:48.171
-You are Michael, aren´t you?
-That´s right.

14:48.406 --> 14:50.874
I´m very interested in murders.

14:51.108 --> 14:52.905
Forgive me if I seem inquisitive...

14:53.744 --> 14:55.769
-...but where´d it happen?
-At Murcia.

14:56.013 --> 14:57.503
How´d you do it?

14:57.949 --> 14:59.780
No, let me guess.

15:00.017 --> 15:02.645
You did it with your hands, didn´t you?

15:02.887 --> 15:05.481
Does it ever bother you
when you think about it?

15:06.190 --> 15:07.748
What did he do to you?

15:08.426 --> 15:09.222
Nothing.

15:09.460 --> 15:11.928
You just killed him
for the fun of it, eh?

15:12.396 --> 15:14.921
He was a Franco spy.
There was a war at the time.

15:15.166 --> 15:18.260
Then it wasn´t murder, I suppose.

15:18.569 --> 15:21.470
Tell me, would you do it again?

15:23.374 --> 15:25.274
Would you mind killing another man?

15:25.509 --> 15:28.603
I´d kill another Franco spy.

15:29.013 --> 15:33.450
I was on a pro-Franco committee,
fella, during the Spanish War.

15:34.018 --> 15:36.486
Would you kill me
if I gave you the chance?

15:36.721 --> 15:38.586
I may give you the chance.

15:38.956 --> 15:40.514
Michael!

15:40.958 --> 15:42.357
Michael!

15:42.593 --> 15:44.891
Before Li went ashore,
did he make lunch?

15:45.129 --> 15:47.359
-Yes, ma´am.
-ls there enough for two?

15:47.865 --> 15:50.231
I don´t know. Why don´t
you ask Mrs. Bannister?

15:50.468 --> 15:51.526
You ask her.

15:51.769 --> 15:53.930
Would you like
a good paste in the eye?

16:00.711 --> 16:03.271
I wish she´d asked me to go swimming.

16:09.120 --> 16:10.087
She´ll ask you.

16:11.889 --> 16:13.686
You wait and see.

16:22.466 --> 16:23.364
Will you help me?

16:35.112 --> 16:36.739
Give me a cigarette.

16:38.783 --> 16:40.512
I´m learning to smoke now.

16:42.286 --> 16:44.652
Ever since that night in the park...

16:46.791 --> 16:48.349
...I´ve been getting the habit.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.924
Do all rich women
play games like this?

16:55.833 --> 16:57.425
Call me Rosalie.

17:20.624 --> 17:23.957
-I didn´t think you would do that.
-I didn´t either.

17:26.664 --> 17:28.256
You´re scared, aren´t you?

17:28.666 --> 17:29.997
You´re scared.

17:31.635 --> 17:33.262
I´m scared too.

17:38.542 --> 17:40.772
Methinks you needed me to help you.

17:42.646 --> 17:45.547
Sure, if you need
anything, you help yourself.

17:45.783 --> 17:47.751
I´m not what you think I am.

17:47.985 --> 17:50.146
I just try to be like that.

17:50.621 --> 17:52.179
Keep on trying...

17:52.523 --> 17:54.047
...you might make it.

17:57.528 --> 17:58.927
Oh, Michael.

18:01.732 --> 18:03.029
What are we scared of?

18:09.640 --> 18:12.404
So long, kiddies!

18:13.210 --> 18:14.700
Now he knows about us.

18:15.045 --> 18:16.603
I wish I did.

18:19.917 --> 18:22.078
Bye-bye!

18:30.494 --> 18:31.654
Michael.

18:31.929 --> 18:32.725
Yes, sir.

18:32.963 --> 18:35.056
Mr. Grisby has
just told me something...

18:35.299 --> 18:37.927
...I´m very sorry to hear.

18:38.169 --> 18:41.229
Lover, this concerns you
more than anyone else.

18:41.472 --> 18:44.270
Don´t take your arms...

18:45.276 --> 18:47.107
...away

18:47.511 --> 18:51.277
According to George here,
Michael is anxious to quit.

18:51.515 --> 18:55.042
Comes a change in weather

18:55.286 --> 18:58.255
-Did you know about that, lover?
-No, I didn´t.

18:59.089 --> 19:02.616
Shut up, George. What´s
the matter, the hours too long?

19:02.860 --> 19:05.021
-No, sir.
-How about the money?

19:05.262 --> 19:06.559
I don´t care about that.

19:06.797 --> 19:09.960
Money doesn´t interest you.
Are you independently wealthy?

19:10.201 --> 19:11.065
I´m independent.

19:11.302 --> 19:12.599
Of money?

19:13.103 --> 19:16.869
Before you start that novel,
you better learn something.

19:17.107 --> 19:20.372
You traveled around the world
too much to find out about it.

19:20.611 --> 19:21.543
That´s good.

19:21.912 --> 19:23.072
Well, sir...

19:24.415 --> 19:26.906
...I´ve always found
it sanitary to be broke.

19:27.151 --> 19:28.846
That´s good too, Arthur.

19:29.086 --> 19:30.348
Shut up, George.

19:31.655 --> 19:36.251
Money cannot bring you health
and happiness, et cetera, is that it?

19:38.062 --> 19:41.463
Without money, I´d be flat
on my back in a county hospital.

19:41.699 --> 19:44.862
Look at this yacht.
It once belonged to Jules Bachrach...

19:45.102 --> 19:49.801
...who kept me out of his club because
my mother was a Manchester Greek.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.029
I got him on perjury.

19:52.142 --> 19:54.406
He died bankrupt, and here I am.

19:54.645 --> 19:55.873
George.

19:56.113 --> 19:58.741
-Each has his idea of happiness...
-Light this for me.

19:58.983 --> 19:59.813
I´ve got no match.

20:00.050 --> 20:02.382
...but money is what
all of us have in common.

20:02.620 --> 20:05.817
Take Bessie, here.
She used to work for Bachrach.

20:06.056 --> 20:08.889
-I pay her more, don´t I?
-Yes, Mr. Bannister.

20:09.126 --> 20:11.117
Her salary means happiness.

20:11.362 --> 20:12.852
It means a home.

20:13.097 --> 20:15.190
Three rooms for two families.

20:15.432 --> 20:18.128
She´s a grandmother and
a widow and only one boy works.

20:18.369 --> 20:19.495
-lsn´t that right?
-Yes.

20:19.737 --> 20:20.999
Yes, of course it is.

20:21.238 --> 20:23.729
So Bessie goes
to church every Sunday...

20:23.974 --> 20:28.809
...and prays to God she´ll never be
too old to earn the salary I pay her.

20:34.151 --> 20:35.641
You call yourself independent.

20:36.754 --> 20:40.246
-Come and see me five years from now.
-Aye-aye, sir.

20:44.695 --> 20:46.526
Sing it for us again, lover.

20:48.232 --> 20:51.292
Why do you stand for that?
I´m quitting. Why don´t you?

20:51.535 --> 20:53.400
You heard him, I need the money!

20:53.637 --> 20:56.504
Talk of money and murder.
I must be insane...

20:56.740 --> 20:58.367
...or these people are lunatics.

20:58.609 --> 21:00.167
That´s why I can´t leave.

21:00.411 --> 21:02.276
That poor little child he married...

21:02.513 --> 21:04.708
...somebody´s got to take care of her.

21:06.417 --> 21:09.477
Please don´t hold me

21:10.387 --> 21:14.323
But if you hold me

21:15.526 --> 21:19.018
Don´t take your arms

21:20.064 --> 21:21.827
Away

21:25.202 --> 21:28.660
Comes a change in weather

21:29.373 --> 21:32.342
Comes a change of heart

21:33.210 --> 21:36.077
And who knows when

21:36.880 --> 21:40.611
The rain will start

21:43.787 --> 21:46.119
So I beg you

21:46.523 --> 21:50.960
Please don´t love me

21:52.096 --> 21:55.293
But if you love me

21:57.301 --> 22:01.067
Then don´t take your lips

22:01.805 --> 22:04.239
Or your arms

22:04.908 --> 22:07.308
Or your love

22:08.712 --> 22:11.840
Away

22:15.452 --> 22:16.248
Rub

22:16.887 --> 22:20.323
Rub Glosso Lusto in your hair

22:20.557 --> 22:22.320
Keep it Glosso Lusto bright

22:22.760 --> 22:26.161
G-L-O double-S-O
L-U-S-T-O

22:26.897 --> 22:30.025
Is right
Glosso Lusto

22:31.735 --> 22:35.000
So remember, ladies, use Glosso Lusto.

22:35.239 --> 22:37.002
Pleases your hair.

22:37.241 --> 22:39.607
Pleases the man you love.

22:39.843 --> 22:41.242
Will you help me?

22:43.947 --> 22:47.713
Love. Do you believe
in love at all, Mrs. Bannister?

22:50.187 --> 22:51.518
Give me the wheel.

23:01.899 --> 23:04.925
I was taught to think
about love in Chinese.

23:05.436 --> 23:09.497
The way a Frenchman
thinks about laughter in French?

23:10.607 --> 23:12.302
The Chinese say...

23:12.876 --> 23:15.140
...it is difficult
for love to last long...

23:15.379 --> 23:18.576
...therefore, one
who loves passionately...

23:18.816 --> 23:20.909
...is cured of love in the end.

23:21.151 --> 23:22.675
That´s a hard way of thinking.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.547
There´s more to the proverb.

23:25.522 --> 23:27.683
Human nature is eternal...

23:27.925 --> 23:30.985
...therefore, one
who follows his nature...

23:31.228 --> 23:34.959
...keeps his
original nature in the end.

23:38.502 --> 23:39.526
Lover.

23:39.770 --> 23:40.930
Yes.

23:41.638 --> 23:45.404
Aren´t you glad I talked
Michael into coming along...

23:45.642 --> 23:46.540
...lover?

23:46.777 --> 23:48.768
He must´ve changed his mind about me.

23:49.012 --> 23:52.448
Faith, Mr. Bannister.
I´ve already told your wife...

23:52.683 --> 23:55.675
...I never make up my mind
about anything at all...

23:56.553 --> 23:58.646
...until it´s over and done with.

24:07.498 --> 24:10.831
I´d like to, but
I can´t deny that Mr. Bannister...

24:11.068 --> 24:14.629
...didn´t try to give his
wife the things she wanted.

24:15.839 --> 24:18.740
She´d said once
that she liked picnics.

24:18.976 --> 24:21.342
We were on our way
up the Mexican coast...

24:21.578 --> 24:24.103
...when he decided
to stop and give her one.

24:25.415 --> 24:28.407
Well, Mr. Bannister´s picnic party...

24:28.652 --> 24:31.519
...was most typical of him.

24:32.389 --> 24:35.187
A lot of trouble
and money went into it...

24:35.425 --> 24:38.258
...but it was no more a picnic...

24:38.495 --> 24:41.328
...than Bannister was a man.

24:42.399 --> 24:44.264
When you hear what I got for you...

24:44.501 --> 24:48.699
Sid, we´ve worked many cases. I´ll
be sorry to make this one the last.

24:48.939 --> 24:51.305
-This is...
-There´s a plot against my life.

24:51.542 --> 24:54.033
I´m going to be murdered.
Isn´t that it?

24:54.278 --> 24:55.643
I´m going to be killed.

24:55.879 --> 24:58.347
Why, Sid, don´t you
think I know about it?

24:58.582 --> 25:00.516
All about it!

25:01.318 --> 25:02.910
Now leave me alone!

25:03.220 --> 25:05.279
I want to enjoy myself.

26:14.958 --> 26:16.050
Michael!

26:18.695 --> 26:22.096
I found out about Broome. I tried
to tell you, he isn´t a steward.

26:22.399 --> 26:24.196
-Not a good one.
-He´s a detective.

26:24.434 --> 26:28.200
My husband hires him to watch me,
so I´ll never be able to divorce him.

26:28.438 --> 26:31.703
-So he can divorce you.
-He wants to cut me off without a cent.

26:31.942 --> 26:34.172
Does that matter so much?

26:36.713 --> 26:39.181
Sweet, you don´t know
anything about the world.

26:40.017 --> 26:42.577
Lately, I´ve been
rounding out my education.

27:01.204 --> 27:05.664
I´ll say this much for you, Arthur.
When you give a picnic, it´s a picnic.

27:06.209 --> 27:07.836
Time for another?

27:08.612 --> 27:10.273
-Arthur.
-Time for another.

27:10.514 --> 27:13.244
-You know what? Michael still insists...
-What?

27:13.483 --> 27:14.814
I beg your pardon?

27:15.919 --> 27:17.546
I said what.

27:17.788 --> 27:20.552
Michael still insists on quitting.

27:20.924 --> 27:23.154
-Why shouldn´t he?
-Oh, no.

27:23.393 --> 27:26.658
-Arthur ought to make him stay.
-lf he wants to go, let him.

27:26.897 --> 27:29.889
But George likes
to have him around, lover.

27:30.133 --> 27:34.399
MichaeI´s so big and strong.
Makes a good bodyguard for you.

27:34.638 --> 27:36.162
Isn´t that what you said, George?

27:36.406 --> 27:37.737
I don´t need a bodyguard.

27:37.974 --> 27:40.943
-Not even a big, strong one?
-Don´t make another drink.

27:41.178 --> 27:43.146
-With an Irish brogue?
-He´s had enough.

27:43.380 --> 27:47.874
George thinks MichaeI´s falling
for you, and that makes me unhappy.

27:48.118 --> 27:49.517
George hopes...

27:49.753 --> 27:51.744
...but George is wrong again.

27:52.055 --> 27:53.352
Now, Arthur...

27:53.590 --> 27:57.617
-I didn´t say anything about them.
-Make me another drink, George.

27:59.162 --> 28:01.653
Another Grisby special, coming up.

28:01.898 --> 28:04.890
You know, you´re
a stupid fool, George.

28:05.469 --> 28:10.236
You ought to realize I don´t mind it a
bit if MichaeI´s in love with my wife.

28:11.308 --> 28:12.832
He´s young.

28:13.110 --> 28:14.907
She´s young.

28:16.513 --> 28:18.208
He´s strong.

28:22.152 --> 28:23.619
She´s beautiful.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.155
Sit down, darling.

28:31.294 --> 28:33.353
Where´s your sense of humor?

28:34.398 --> 28:36.298
I don´t have to listen to you.

28:36.533 --> 28:38.626
Oh, yes you do, lover.

28:39.569 --> 28:40.729
Now, Arthur...

28:40.971 --> 28:43.030
...you leave Elsa alone.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.398
Come to think of it...

28:46.209 --> 28:49.110
...why doesn´t Michael
want to work for us?

28:50.113 --> 28:51.410
Why should he?

28:53.216 --> 28:56.276
Why should anyone want
to live around us?

28:56.920 --> 28:59.115
Where´s your sense of adventure?

28:59.356 --> 29:00.880
Broome!

29:01.958 --> 29:05.985
-Excuse me, sir, he´s eating.
-Tell Michael to step over here.

29:06.229 --> 29:07.491
Aye, sir.

29:12.969 --> 29:16.871
Hey, Mike, they want to see you
over there, Mr. Bannister and them.

29:29.853 --> 29:31.616
Well, Michael!

29:32.756 --> 29:34.417
Well, Mr. Bannister?

29:34.658 --> 29:38.992
My wife´s lost her sense of humor, and
you´ve lost your sense of adventure.

29:39.229 --> 29:41.857
Sit down and have a drink.
Give him a drink, George.

29:42.299 --> 29:44.597
And don´t look so shocked.

29:45.135 --> 29:49.401
Michael may not be in the Social
Register, but then neither are you...

29:49.639 --> 29:50.435
...anymore.

29:55.479 --> 29:57.538
Is this what you folks
do for amusement?

29:57.781 --> 30:01.842
Sit around toasting marshmallows
and call each other names?

30:02.652 --> 30:06.213
If you´re so anxious for me
to join the game, I´d be glad to.

30:07.290 --> 30:09.952
I have a few names I´d like
to be calling you myself.

30:10.193 --> 30:12.889
Oh, but, Michael, that isn´t fair.

30:13.129 --> 30:15.757
You´re bound to lose the contest.

30:15.999 --> 30:18.593
We´ll have to give you
a handicap, Michael.

30:19.369 --> 30:22.133
You should know what
George knows about me...

30:22.372 --> 30:24.738
...if you really want
to call me names.

30:25.075 --> 30:25.973
And, Michael...

30:27.978 --> 30:31.880
...if you think George´s
story is interesting...

30:32.115 --> 30:36.415
...you ought to hear the one about
how Elsa got to be my wife.

30:38.855 --> 30:42.450
Do you want me to tell him
what you´ve got on me, Arthur?

30:46.496 --> 30:47.554
Do you know...

30:47.831 --> 30:51.164
...once, off the hump of Brazil...

30:51.401 --> 30:54.996
...I saw the ocean so darkened
with blood it was black...

30:55.238 --> 30:58.639
...and the sun fainting away
over the lip of the sky.

30:58.875 --> 31:00.604
We´d put in at Fortaleza...

31:00.844 --> 31:04.041
...and a few of us had lines out
for a bit of idle fishing.

31:04.281 --> 31:06.681
It was me had the first strike.

31:07.250 --> 31:08.649
A shark it was.

31:09.653 --> 31:11.348
Then there was another.

31:11.588 --> 31:13.613
And another shark again.

31:14.257 --> 31:16.817
Till all about, the sea
was made of sharks...

31:17.060 --> 31:19.119
...and more sharks still.

31:19.629 --> 31:21.290
And no water at all.

31:22.232 --> 31:25.201
My shark had torn himself
from the hook...

31:25.535 --> 31:29.972
...and the scent or maybe the stain it
was, and him bleeding his life away...

31:30.206 --> 31:32.003
...drove the rest of them mad.

31:32.242 --> 31:35.040
Then the beasts took
to eating each other.

31:35.779 --> 31:37.474
In their frenzy...

31:38.114 --> 31:40.548
...they ate at themselves.

31:41.418 --> 31:45.616
You could feel the lust of murder
like a wind stinging your eyes.

31:46.122 --> 31:50.456
And you could smell the death
reeking up out of the sea.

31:51.728 --> 31:53.628
I never saw anything worse...

31:54.097 --> 31:56.622
...until this little picnic tonight.

31:57.334 --> 31:58.528
And you know...

31:59.135 --> 32:03.629
...there wasn´t one of them sharks
in the whole crazy pack that survived.

32:06.109 --> 32:07.804
I´ll be leaving you now.

32:13.950 --> 32:15.815
George, that´s the first time...

32:16.052 --> 32:19.749
...anyone ever thought enough
of you to call you a shark.

32:21.558 --> 32:24.618
If you were a good lawyer,
you´d be flattered.

32:45.749 --> 32:48.843
-Where´s Mrs. Bannister?
-I´m sure I don´t know, sir.

32:49.719 --> 32:52.279
-She adores it here in Acapulco.
-So do I...

32:52.522 --> 32:56.151
It´s nice and quaint, but when are
we gonna get back to Frisco?

32:56.393 --> 32:58.224
Mind walking with me, fella?

32:58.461 --> 33:01.157
I know all the best places.
You might enjoy it.

33:01.398 --> 33:03.457
I want to make you a proposition.

33:15.645 --> 33:19.411
-Beautiful, isn´t it?
-The beach, you mean, or the tourists?

33:19.649 --> 33:20.911
Everything.

33:21.151 --> 33:23.051
´Tis a fair face to the land...

33:23.286 --> 33:25.948
...but you can´t hide
the hunger and guilt.

33:26.389 --> 33:28.084
It´s a bright, guilty world.

33:38.301 --> 33:41.168
Darling, of course you pay me!

33:41.404 --> 33:43.338
What´s your guess, Michael?

33:44.207 --> 33:45.970
Think the world´s coming to an end?

33:46.209 --> 33:49.303
There was a start to the world,
so I guess there´ll be a stop.

33:54.918 --> 33:56.579
It´s coming, you know.

33:57.654 --> 33:58.882
Oh, yeah.

33:59.222 --> 34:00.587
It´s got to come.

34:03.193 --> 34:04.990
First the big cities...

34:06.329 --> 34:08.092
...then maybe even this.

34:08.931 --> 34:10.831
It´s just got to come.

34:11.101 --> 34:13.899
I prefer to be somewhere else
when it does.

34:14.170 --> 34:15.364
I will be.

34:16.072 --> 34:19.530
That´s what I need you for,
to see to it that I´m not around.

34:20.176 --> 34:22.337
-How´d you like $5000?
-What?

34:22.579 --> 34:25.605
That´s what I said.
$5000, fella.

34:27.217 --> 34:28.911
What do I have to do for it?

34:29.152 --> 34:33.282
I´ll fill in the details later.
Meanwhile, think it over, Michael.

34:33.523 --> 34:35.456
Five thousand dollars.

34:36.525 --> 34:37.458
It´s yours.

34:37.761 --> 34:40.195
All you have to do is kill somebody.

34:40.630 --> 34:42.063
Who, Mr. Grisby?

34:42.297 --> 34:44.630
I´m particular who I murder.

34:46.603 --> 34:47.661
Good boy!

34:52.108 --> 34:53.040
You know...

34:53.275 --> 34:55.676
...I wouldn´t like
to kill just anybody.

34:56.446 --> 34:59.108
-ls it someone I know?
-Oh, yeah.

34:59.549 --> 35:00.709
But you´ll never guess.

35:01.684 --> 35:03.914
-I give up.
-It's me.

35:05.288 --> 35:06.755
I´m perfectly sober, Michael.

35:06.990 --> 35:10.619
I´m willing to pay $5000
if the job is well done.

35:11.261 --> 35:14.025
This is a straightforward
business proposition.

35:15.298 --> 35:16.925
I want you to kill me.

35:18.468 --> 35:19.935
So long, fella!

35:30.713 --> 35:31.975
Elsa!

35:48.665 --> 35:50.792
-Michael?
-Yes.

35:52.836 --> 35:55.828
-You talked to George yesterday?
-I did.

35:56.706 --> 36:01.040
-Did he say anything about us?
-He´s afraid the world will explode.

36:01.511 --> 36:03.809
He talked about suicide.

36:13.556 --> 36:15.547
I´ve thought of that sometimes.

36:15.792 --> 36:17.225
Suicide?

36:18.628 --> 36:20.653
Do you think it´s wrong, Michael?

36:21.030 --> 36:22.327
I don´t know.

36:23.366 --> 36:25.766
Would you kill yourself if you had to?

36:27.270 --> 36:28.430
I don´t know.

36:31.908 --> 36:34.809
-I´ve looked at the pills many times...
-Pills?

36:35.044 --> 36:37.808
The ones my husband takes
to kill the pain.

36:38.848 --> 36:42.079
And wondered if enough of them
would kill my pain.

36:42.318 --> 36:44.479
The pain of just being alive?

36:44.721 --> 36:48.657
Mr. Grisby wants to be cured of that
pain. He wants me to cure him.

36:48.958 --> 36:52.553
Mr. Grisby wants me
to kill Mr. Grisby.

36:53.129 --> 36:56.462
-I´m sure he´s out of his mind.
-He´s not sane.

36:56.699 --> 37:00.328
-Neither is Arthur.
-Arthur can take care of himself.

37:01.638 --> 37:04.198
-What do you want?
-Beautiful moon.

37:04.674 --> 37:07.541
Nice night for it,
ain´t it, Mr. O´Hara?

37:10.713 --> 37:12.874
You didn´t answer me, Mr. O´Hara.

37:13.116 --> 37:14.981
Speak when you´re spoken to.

37:15.218 --> 37:18.085
I´d hate to have to report you
to the lady´s husband.

37:18.321 --> 37:20.721
I said it´s a nice night for it.

37:46.950 --> 37:48.975
Would you care to dance with me?

37:56.426 --> 37:59.395
Stop crying. I can´t stand
for you to cry.

37:59.629 --> 38:02.189
-You know what Broome´s been doing?
-Spying.

38:02.432 --> 38:04.093
Spying on you.

38:04.534 --> 38:08.026
Sure I´m gonna take you
where there aren´t any spies.

38:08.838 --> 38:10.863
-Where?
-A long way off.

38:11.107 --> 38:13.871
-Somewhere to the far places.
-Far places?

38:14.110 --> 38:18.945
We´re in one of them now. Running
away doesn´t work. I tried it.

38:20.416 --> 38:22.816
Everything´s bad, Michael.

38:23.052 --> 38:24.610
Everything.

38:24.854 --> 38:27.482
You can´t escape it or fight it.
Get along with it.

38:27.724 --> 38:30.124
Deal with it. Make terms.

38:30.994 --> 38:33.861
You´re such a foolish
knight errant, Michael.

38:34.097 --> 38:36.122
You´re big and strong.

38:36.366 --> 38:39.096
You just don´t know
how to take care of yourself.

38:39.335 --> 38:41.735
So how could you take care of me?

38:41.971 --> 38:43.905
Mike! Hey, Mike!

38:44.640 --> 38:46.733
If you´ll pardon me this intrusion...

38:46.976 --> 38:50.002
-...there´s a couple of cops out here.
-Cops?

38:52.048 --> 38:53.709
I don´t speak their language.

38:53.950 --> 38:56.214
And they wants me to identify this guy.

38:56.452 --> 38:59.421
What´s the Spanish for "drunken bum"?

39:04.293 --> 39:07.626
It was early October when
we made San Francisco...

39:07.864 --> 39:12.494
...and dropped anchor across the bay
from the city, in Sausalito.

39:12.735 --> 39:15.602
It had been a most
interesting cruise.

39:15.838 --> 39:18.773
All very rich and rare and strange.

39:19.008 --> 39:21.408
But I had had no stomach for it.

39:21.644 --> 39:25.774
To begin with, living on a hook
takes away your appetite.

39:26.282 --> 39:30.309
You´ve no taste for any pleasure
but the one that´s burning in you.

39:30.553 --> 39:32.521
But even without an appetite...

39:32.755 --> 39:37.658
...I´d learned it´s quite amazing
how much a fool like me can swallow.

39:38.361 --> 39:40.522
Please, Michael, be careful.

39:43.199 --> 39:45.064
The car´s down there.

39:46.035 --> 39:48.731
Mr. Bannister´s waiting to
take you into the city...

39:48.971 --> 39:52.202
...to San Francisco,
but you´re not going with him.

39:53.242 --> 39:54.903
You´re going with me.

39:56.345 --> 39:57.676
Michael...

39:58.848 --> 40:00.338
I can take care of you.

40:00.583 --> 40:04.485
You think I´d take you to a desert
island to eat berries and goat´s milk.

40:04.720 --> 40:07.120
And I´d have to take in
washing to support you.

40:07.356 --> 40:09.483
Hello, kiddies.

40:10.293 --> 40:12.056
There´s George.

40:13.863 --> 40:16.923
What would you say to $5000
to get us started?

40:17.166 --> 40:20.067
We´ve got a date with
a couple of beers, fella.

40:20.803 --> 40:22.737
Arthur was asking for you.

40:23.372 --> 40:25.772
He´d wondered where you´d gone.

40:27.944 --> 40:29.809
I won´t tell him.

40:32.148 --> 40:35.777
-You didn´t answer my question. $5000?
-Goodbye, Michael.

40:36.486 --> 40:38.386
Couldn´t we start on that?

40:41.023 --> 40:44.356
Would you have to take in
washing on $5000?

41:02.812 --> 41:04.177
Sit down.

41:06.315 --> 41:09.512
I suppose you wonder what´s behind
my little proposition.

41:10.052 --> 41:14.716
None of your business, actually,
but since we´re partners in crime...

41:15.057 --> 41:19.892
...I´ll tell you, our firm´s insured
against the death of either partner.

41:20.129 --> 41:23.587
That means if one of us dies,
the other will get a lot of money.

41:23.833 --> 41:26.893
-Thanks. Now, leave us alone.
-Yes, sir.

41:27.436 --> 41:31.236
Like some other people we both know,
I´m not very happily married.

41:31.474 --> 41:33.203
And another thing, frankly...

41:33.442 --> 41:38.072
...I don´t want to be within 1000
miles of that city or any city...

41:38.314 --> 41:41.681
...when they start
dropping those bombs.

41:42.151 --> 41:44.915
There´s been a suggestion
we drive you into town.

41:45.154 --> 41:46.849
Want a beer before you go?

41:47.089 --> 41:50.149
I´ll be waiting with
Mrs. Bannister in the car.

41:51.594 --> 41:54.290
Better meet me in my office.
Make it late tonight.

41:54.530 --> 41:55.394
What for?

41:55.631 --> 41:57.292
$5000.

41:57.600 --> 42:01.001
That´ll take a girl and a sailor
on a nice little trip.

42:03.172 --> 42:05.367
-I´ll meet you at your office.
-Do.

42:05.608 --> 42:07.508
There´s a paper I´d like you to sign.

42:07.743 --> 42:10.303
It´s nothing very binding or important,
really.

42:10.546 --> 42:12.673
Just a confession of murder.

42:13.683 --> 42:14.980
Here´s to crime.

42:25.962 --> 42:28.988
She say meet you at aquarium.
9:00, before people there.

42:29.232 --> 42:30.665
The aquarium?

42:30.900 --> 42:32.094
Oh, uh...

42:32.468 --> 42:35.232
...if you ever need
a good lawyer, Michael...

42:36.205 --> 42:37.570
...let me know.

42:41.611 --> 42:44.910
"l, Michael O´Hara, in order
to live in peace with my God...

42:45.147 --> 42:49.106
...do freely make the following
confession. On August 9th..."

42:49.352 --> 42:50.717
That´s tomorrow night.

42:51.187 --> 42:53.485
"...I shot and killed
Mr. George Grisby...

42:53.723 --> 42:55.816
...placing his corpse
in the Sausalito Bay."

42:56.058 --> 42:57.025
Just a minute.

42:57.260 --> 42:59.990
What you´re reading, am I
supposed to have written it?

43:01.130 --> 43:02.620
It´s your confession.

43:03.032 --> 43:05.466
It´s the easiest 5000
you´re ever gonna earn.

43:05.701 --> 43:07.328
Why don´t you do it yourself?

43:07.570 --> 43:10.095
Commit suicide? Me? Don´t be silly.

43:10.339 --> 43:14.366
Suicide is against the law.
And we´re not gonna break the law.

43:14.610 --> 43:18.171
This is going to be murder,
and it´s going to be legal.

43:18.414 --> 43:21.076
I want to live, but I want to vanish.

43:21.317 --> 43:24.718
I want to go away and change my name
and never be heard of again.

43:24.954 --> 43:28.981
But that costs money.
It isn´t easy nowadays.

43:29.225 --> 43:31.125
If they´re looking, they´ll find you.

43:31.360 --> 43:33.624
Unless they think you´re dead.

43:33.863 --> 43:37.890
They´ll find you even on the smallest
island in the South Seas.

43:38.534 --> 43:40.434
That´s where I´m going to be, fella.

43:40.670 --> 43:42.797
On that smallest island.

43:43.806 --> 43:47.435
I´ll mail the rest to you
after the "murder".

43:48.711 --> 43:51.407
But I want to live on
that island in peace.

43:51.981 --> 43:56.077
That won´t be possible unless
the world is satisfied I don´t exist.

43:57.186 --> 43:59.518
You know, the law´s
a funny thing, fella.

44:00.056 --> 44:02.650
The state of California
will say I´m dead...

44:02.892 --> 44:04.450
...officially dead...

44:04.694 --> 44:07.128
...if somebody´ll say
they murdered me.

44:07.663 --> 44:09.528
That´s what I´m paying you for.

44:10.066 --> 44:12.296
-To murder you?
-Say you did.

44:13.135 --> 44:15.729
-What happens to you, really?
-I disappear.

44:15.971 --> 44:18.531
-What happens to me?
-Nothing.

44:19.108 --> 44:20.575
That´s the choker.

44:20.810 --> 44:23.506
You swear you killed me,
but you can´t be arrested.

44:23.746 --> 44:26.271
That´s the law.
Look it up for yourself.

44:26.582 --> 44:28.482
There´s no such thing as homicide...

44:28.718 --> 44:30.845
...unless they find a corpse.

44:31.087 --> 44:33.817
It just isn´t murder
if they don´t find a body.

44:34.156 --> 44:35.817
According to the law...

44:36.058 --> 44:40.051
...I´m dead if you say
you murdered me.

44:40.296 --> 44:44.198
But you´re not a murderer
unless I´m dead.

44:45.634 --> 44:47.226
Silly, isn´t it?

44:53.609 --> 44:55.099
I´ve never seen an aquarium.

44:56.912 --> 44:58.402
Would you show me about?

45:02.017 --> 45:04.212
I couldn´t think where
else we could meet.

45:04.520 --> 45:07.512
-Only tourists come here and children.
-And lovers?

45:07.757 --> 45:09.054
-Oh, Michael.
-Fair Rosalie.

45:09.291 --> 45:10.189
-Love me?
-I do.

45:10.426 --> 45:12.656
Do you still want to
take me away with you?

45:13.062 --> 45:14.324
Why do you ask me that?

45:14.563 --> 45:16.997
Will you carry me off
into the sunrise?

45:17.233 --> 45:19.667
I´ll take proper care of you.
You won´t starve.

45:19.902 --> 45:22.462
I don´t care where it is, Michael.

45:22.772 --> 45:24.399
Just take me there.

45:25.274 --> 45:26.366
Take me quick.

45:28.043 --> 45:29.032
Take me.

45:44.026 --> 45:46.620
-Come on, come on.
-Can´t I look? I want to see.

45:48.330 --> 45:49.524
I don´t want you to worry...

45:49.765 --> 45:51.198
-I am.
-I have arrangements...

45:51.434 --> 45:54.870
The things you said
yesterday about money.

45:55.271 --> 45:58.001
You didn´t sound like you.

45:58.607 --> 46:01.235
You´re not going to try
anything foolish, are you?

46:01.777 --> 46:04.940
I´m afraid so.
Something very foolish indeed.

46:09.084 --> 46:12.349
"l, Michael O´Hara, in order
to live in peace with my God...

46:12.588 --> 46:14.715
...do freely make the following
confession."

46:14.957 --> 46:18.154
Read the last part.
That explains the whole of it.

46:22.665 --> 46:27.568
"We arrived at the boat landing.
Mr. Grisby heard a suspicious sound.

46:28.003 --> 46:32.872
He was scared of a holdup and asked
me to get the gun out of the car.

46:33.108 --> 46:38.011
I reached in and got the gun, but
it went off by accident in my hand.

46:38.347 --> 46:41.783
And I saw that Mr. Grisby
was all covered with blood.

46:43.652 --> 46:46.553
It took me a minute to realize
that Mr. Grisby was dead.

46:46.789 --> 46:50.122
To realize that I,
Michael O´Hara, had killed him."

46:52.428 --> 46:57.331
But I don´t understand. What were
you doing with George in Sausalito?

46:57.566 --> 47:02.060
It says Mr. Grisby wants to go to the
yacht and asks me to drive him there.

47:03.005 --> 47:04.939
And that´s where I kill him.

47:05.508 --> 47:07.806
With the rough tide in the bay...

47:08.043 --> 47:10.773
...they wouldn´t recover
the body if there was one.

47:11.747 --> 47:13.647
You don´t understand, darling.

47:13.983 --> 47:16.417
He isn´t dead yet. Grisby´s alive.

47:16.652 --> 47:20.918
He won´t be murdered till tonight.
Is that foolish enough for you?

47:21.156 --> 47:23.989
My husband wrote that
and got you to sign it for him.

47:24.226 --> 47:26.717
It´s one of those famous
Bannister tricks.

47:26.962 --> 47:31.865
It´s Grisby´s idea. It seems
Mr. Grisby wants to disappear.

47:32.167 --> 47:36.263
And this is a scheme of his
to get himself declared dead.

47:37.139 --> 47:41.303
There´s more to it than that, Michael.
I don´t know what, but there´s more.

47:41.544 --> 47:43.705
It´s a trap of some kind.

47:46.081 --> 47:48.982
You´ll meet George tonight,
just as he arranged.

47:49.218 --> 47:53.086
Go with him to Sausalito and
do whatever he asks you to do.

47:53.322 --> 47:55.847
As long as nobody gets hurt,
it won´t matter.

47:56.158 --> 47:57.989
But don´t let him out of your sight.

47:58.227 --> 48:01.594
Maybe George isn´t as big a fool
as he seems to be, but...

48:01.830 --> 48:04.799
...I´ll swear my husband´s
behind this whole thing.

48:05.935 --> 48:09.336
Oh, Michael, why did you let yourself
get dragged into it?

48:09.572 --> 48:13.474
Sure because I´m a fool.
A deliberate, intentional fool.

48:13.709 --> 48:16.303
And that´s the worst kind,
or didn´t you know?

48:16.545 --> 48:20.345
Yes, my beloved. My beloved fool,
I know.

48:26.889 --> 48:30.222
I don´t think anybody´s home,
just Broome.

48:30.726 --> 48:34.321
Mr. Bannister´s in the city, and
Mrs. Bannister went to the movies.

48:35.230 --> 48:37.130
Better wait for me in the kitchen.

48:37.600 --> 48:39.693
Make some coffee. We´ll both need it.

48:40.502 --> 48:41.901
I´ve got things to attend to.

48:55.050 --> 48:56.039
Well?

48:56.952 --> 49:00.388
I wonder, am I the only one
that´s onto you and her?

49:00.623 --> 49:03.820
Nobody else seems to guess
you´re sweet on her.

49:04.093 --> 49:05.754
That ought to be worth extra.

49:05.995 --> 49:09.055
-I´ll throw it in for the same price.
-What are you selling?

49:09.298 --> 49:11.232
I can shut up,
that´s what I´m selling.

49:11.634 --> 49:14.125
You see, I´m a snoopy kind of a guy.

49:14.370 --> 49:15.997
I find things out.

49:16.338 --> 49:17.635
I get around.

49:18.207 --> 49:20.903
I got around one afternoon
in Sausalito.

49:21.143 --> 49:23.168
I overheard a conversation
in Mexico.

49:23.412 --> 49:25.403
I found out about a little plot
of yours.

49:26.148 --> 49:29.606
You wouldn´t want me to say nothing
about you framing Michael.

49:29.852 --> 49:32.082
Frame him for a murder
you´re committing.

49:32.321 --> 49:35.188
Let´s talk it over tomorrow, huh?

49:35.424 --> 49:38.450
When you´ll be playing dead and
somebody else is really dead?

49:38.694 --> 49:43.063
No, thanks, Mr. Grisby.
We´ll settle our account right now.

49:44.600 --> 49:46.033
All right, Broome...

49:47.603 --> 49:49.195
...if you insist.

50:11.760 --> 50:13.489
-What are you doing?
-Oh, hello.

50:13.729 --> 50:15.594
I´m sorry. You drive.

50:15.831 --> 50:17.025
Were you shooting a gun?

50:17.266 --> 50:20.599
Yeah, I was just doing
a little target practice.

50:21.437 --> 50:25.134
That´s what you´ll say when you shoot
the gun, down by the boat landing.

50:25.374 --> 50:27.740
People come out of the bar
to see what happened...

50:27.976 --> 50:30.968
...you´ll say, "I was just doing
a little target practice."

50:32.047 --> 50:34.607
Really, you´re supposed
to have shot me.

50:34.850 --> 50:37.216
Later, when nobody´s looking,
you´re supposed...

50:37.453 --> 50:41.150
...to have thrown my corpse
into the bay.

51:08.050 --> 51:09.039
Look out!

51:09.885 --> 51:12.046
Hey, what happened back there?

51:12.287 --> 51:13.652
Anybody hurt?

51:16.992 --> 51:19.825
-Kind of banged it up.
-It's our fault, I´m afraid.

51:20.062 --> 51:23.657
-Here´s my card, for the damage.
-Looks like you´ve got damage.

51:23.899 --> 51:26.163
-Your head´s cut bad.
-It's okay, really.

51:26.401 --> 51:29.564
-It's all right, good night.
-Well, good night, Mr. Grisby.

51:30.239 --> 51:32.104
-Did he get a good look at us?
-What?

51:32.341 --> 51:33.638
Truck driver, I mean.

51:33.876 --> 51:35.776
-He´ll make a good witness.
-What?

51:36.011 --> 51:38.775
He´ll testify he saw us
just before the murder.

51:41.917 --> 51:44.715
Broome, are you ill?

51:45.120 --> 51:48.089
I got some lead in me where it hurts.

51:48.323 --> 51:50.257
-I´ll call a doctor.
-Did already.

51:50.726 --> 51:53.752
The trouble is, the doc
will report to the police.

51:53.996 --> 51:56.965
They´ll want to know who was
the certain party who shot me.

51:57.199 --> 51:59.394
Don´t worry, he´ll get his.

51:59.902 --> 52:01.927
There´s gonna be a murder.

52:02.404 --> 52:04.872
Ain´t no fake murder.
Somebody´s gonna be killed.

52:05.474 --> 52:06.600
You mean...?

52:06.942 --> 52:10.571
-Your husband´s gonna be knocked off.
-What?

52:10.813 --> 52:11.871
Could be.

52:12.281 --> 52:16.479
You´d better get down to his office,
if you want to do anything about it.

52:24.526 --> 52:27.654
-What are you doing?
-Getting blood all over the car.

52:27.896 --> 52:28.726
My blood.

52:28.964 --> 52:32.695
It´s perfect. If you shot me,
there would be blood, fella, see.

52:32.935 --> 52:35.460
Now, when you get back
to the garage...

52:35.704 --> 52:39.834
...start washing out the blood stains.
You´re wiping out the evidence, see.

52:40.075 --> 52:44.171
Be careful not to do such a good job
that they can´t analyze the stains.

52:44.713 --> 52:46.237
Just try to wash that out.

52:46.481 --> 52:48.449
Get the gun
from the glove compartment.

52:48.684 --> 52:50.311
Good. Come on now, let´s go.

52:57.659 --> 53:00.025
Let the ones in the bar
get a good look at you.

53:00.262 --> 53:01.786
They´ll ask about the shooting.

53:02.030 --> 53:05.090
Just say you´re doing
a little target practice.

53:07.069 --> 53:08.866
Wait until the speedboat gets away.

53:09.471 --> 53:11.336
-Understand?
-Where are you going?

53:11.573 --> 53:12.938
Give me that cap.

53:13.709 --> 53:16.769
-What are you laughing at?
-Wait and see.

53:52.047 --> 53:54.948
Why don´t people let
some people get some sleep?

53:57.419 --> 53:59.319
Somebody said they heard a shot.

54:02.925 --> 54:04.222
Hey, what´s with the gun?

54:04.459 --> 54:07.951
I was just doing a little
target practice.

54:08.363 --> 54:10.160
-Where you going now?
-ls he drunk?

54:10.399 --> 54:11.764
He´s soused!

54:18.974 --> 54:21.568
San Rafael...
San Rafael, please.

54:28.150 --> 54:30.414
Hello, I want to speak to
Mrs. Bannister.

54:30.986 --> 54:31.953
What?

54:32.187 --> 54:33.779
It´s me. Broome.

54:34.189 --> 54:36.953
Get down to the office.
Montgomery Street.

54:37.192 --> 54:38.591
You was framed.

54:38.860 --> 54:42.261
Grisby didn´t want to disappear.
He just wanted an alibi.

54:42.497 --> 54:43.828
And you´re it.

54:44.066 --> 54:45.431
You´re the fall guy.

54:45.667 --> 54:49.068
Grisby´s gone down there
to kill Bannister now.

54:49.905 --> 54:50.929
Hello!

54:53.241 --> 54:54.230
Hello!

54:54.876 --> 54:55.865
Hello!

55:07.122 --> 55:08.612
Stop that car!

55:08.857 --> 55:09.915
Stop the car!

55:14.262 --> 55:15.229
Am I too late?

55:15.464 --> 55:17.125
-Why don´t you save Bannister?
-Who?

55:17.366 --> 55:20.301
-Who are you?
-Hey, that´s blood, ain´t it?

55:20.535 --> 55:22.628
-Sure, it´s blood.
-It's all over the seat.

55:22.871 --> 55:24.429
Will you let go of me?

55:25.007 --> 55:27.032
-Give us your name!
-Michael O´Hara!

55:29.111 --> 55:31.272
I want to know about Mr. Bannister!

55:32.614 --> 55:35.913
"l, Michael O´Hara, in order
to live at peace with my God..."

55:36.151 --> 55:37.550
Yes, Michael?

55:39.388 --> 55:41.219
-You were asking for me?
-Pardon me.

55:41.456 --> 55:43.788
"...do freely make the following
confession...

55:44.026 --> 55:48.793
...on the evening of August 9th,
I shot and killed George Grisby."

55:49.798 --> 55:51.663
You weren´t killed. It was Grisby.

55:51.900 --> 55:54.460
Hello, darling.
Have you heard the news?

55:54.703 --> 55:56.136
George has been murdered.

55:56.371 --> 56:00.000
He was found here on the street
with MichaeI´s cap in his hand.

56:01.176 --> 56:03.906
Michael is going to need
a good lawyer.

56:07.082 --> 56:08.572
Well, it´s my own fault...

56:08.817 --> 56:12.617
...but that´s how I got into it,
big boob that I am.

56:12.854 --> 56:16.153
I began to ask myself if
I wasn´t out of my head entirely.

56:16.391 --> 56:18.450
The wrong man was arrested.

56:18.760 --> 56:20.489
The wrong man was shot.

56:21.029 --> 56:24.192
Grisby was dead and so was Broome.

56:24.566 --> 56:26.761
And what about Bannister?

56:27.235 --> 56:31.069
He was going to defend me
in a trial for my life.

56:31.306 --> 56:35.470
And me charged with a couple
of murders I did not commit.

56:35.710 --> 56:39.441
Either me or the rest of the whole
world is absolutely insane.

56:44.886 --> 56:49.118
You know my associate Mr. Sealy, dear.
He´s arranged for your jail pass.

56:49.357 --> 56:51.348
It´s in this building.
Shall he take you?

56:51.593 --> 56:54.562
-I´ll go by myself.
-Sealy, I´ll join you in the office.

56:54.796 --> 56:58.163
Okay, Mr. Bannister.
Excuse me, Mrs. Bannister.

57:01.369 --> 57:03.234
You want to be alone with Michael.

57:03.472 --> 57:05.269
-It's your idea.
-Morning, Bannister.

57:05.507 --> 57:07.873
Morning, judge.
Your boy still in the hospital?

57:08.110 --> 57:10.601
-Been home since Tuesday.
-That´s fine, judge.

57:10.846 --> 57:12.643
-Was it...
-What´s that, lover?

57:12.881 --> 57:15.611
-Oh, I beg your pardon.
-Wasn´t it your idea?

57:15.851 --> 57:18.979
Isn´t it your idea to save Michael
from the gas chamber?

57:19.254 --> 57:22.655
-Aren´t we the only ones who can?
-What do you think? Galloway.

57:22.891 --> 57:26.850
-Hi, Bannister. How´s tricks?
-You know our district attorney, dear.

57:27.095 --> 57:29.495
-How do you do...
-Mrs. Bannister. Fasbender...

57:29.731 --> 57:32.791
I was the murdered man´s partner.
The other was my servant.

57:33.034 --> 57:37.767
If I defend Michael, any jury is going
to figure I believe he´s innocent.

57:38.840 --> 57:42.071
And you have reason to believe
that Michael is innocent?

57:47.282 --> 57:49.876
I hear that Galloway
is going to say...

57:50.118 --> 57:53.952
...that Michael took George´s body
into the city in our speedboat.

57:54.456 --> 57:57.050
-But we can prove...
-Prove? He couldn´t have.

57:57.292 --> 57:58.554
-Why not?
-How´d he get back?

57:58.793 --> 58:00.784
-Back where?
-To the yacht, naturally.

58:01.029 --> 58:03.190
The boat couldn´t have driven itself.

58:03.431 --> 58:07.265
Or maybe it was George´s ghost.
Maybe the boat just drifted back.

58:07.636 --> 58:08.728
Now, lover...

58:09.004 --> 58:11.404
...Michael has to plead
excusable homicide.

58:11.640 --> 58:13.665
But you can prove it wasn´t his gun.

58:13.909 --> 58:16.673
They know it wasn´t
MichaeI´s gun that killed George.

58:16.912 --> 58:19.676
The gun that did kill George
can´t be found, lover.

58:19.915 --> 58:22.645
So we can´t prove that Michael
didn´t shoot him.

58:22.884 --> 58:26.012
And it was MichaeI´s gun
that killed Broome.

58:27.389 --> 58:28.651
Now...

58:29.191 --> 58:32.683
...Michael is going to need
everything that the greatest...

58:32.928 --> 58:35.362
...living trial lawyer can do for him.

58:35.830 --> 58:39.732
Our good district attorney there
has worked up a beautiful case.

58:39.968 --> 58:44.598
The truck driver, the saloonkeeper.
They´ll be effective witnesses.

58:44.839 --> 58:49.242
And he´ll know how to handle them.
And then there´s the crazy confession.

58:49.477 --> 58:51.672
But Michael has an explanation.

58:53.148 --> 58:54.877
-Explanation?
-You think it´s funny.

58:55.116 --> 58:56.140
Funny?

58:56.952 --> 58:59.921
That story about how George
hired Michael to kill George?

59:00.155 --> 59:03.420
-To pretend to kill him.
-Really?

59:04.526 --> 59:07.051
Why would George want to disappear?

59:07.295 --> 59:10.787
-He mentioned partnership insurance.
-What?

59:11.032 --> 59:14.001
-Partnership insurance.
-Which George wanted to collect?

59:14.236 --> 59:17.399
And George wanted everybody
to think he was dead?

59:18.907 --> 59:21.899
Dead, so that he could collect
the insurance?

59:24.379 --> 59:26.779
Well, if he was dead,
how could he collect?

59:27.916 --> 59:29.178
Now, lover...

59:29.751 --> 59:34.211
...if your Irishman doesn´t want to
die, he´s going to have to trust me.

59:34.923 --> 59:35.981
But you...

59:36.758 --> 59:38.225
...do you trust him?

59:39.828 --> 59:41.921
I wouldn´t trust him with my wife.

59:44.332 --> 59:47.324
You want to make sure he doesn´t
get off, don´t you?

59:48.436 --> 59:51.030
I´ve never lost a case, remember?

59:52.607 --> 59:54.234
Besides...

01:00:03.251 --> 01:00:05.879
...my wife might think
he was a martyr.

01:00:07.389 --> 01:00:09.084
I´ve got to defend him.

01:00:10.125 --> 01:00:12.184
I haven´t any choice.

01:00:14.462 --> 01:00:16.225
And neither have you.

01:00:25.507 --> 01:00:26.769
Hello.

01:00:27.609 --> 01:00:30.601
It looks bad for me,
isn´t that what your husband says?

01:00:31.646 --> 01:00:34.479
Whatever else he is,
Arthur´s a marvelous lawyer.

01:00:34.716 --> 01:00:35.842
You´ve got to trust him.

01:00:36.084 --> 01:00:39.918
-Why? Why should I trust him?
-Because it´s your only chance.

01:00:42.457 --> 01:00:44.618
Because I want you to.

01:00:45.093 --> 01:00:47.027
That´ll have to do for a reason.

01:00:47.262 --> 01:00:48.456
Michael...

01:00:49.431 --> 01:00:50.955
-Why did you kill Broome?
-What?

01:00:51.199 --> 01:00:53.292
Don´t be afraid to tell me.
I want to know.

01:00:53.535 --> 01:00:56.402
Grisby killed Broome. He was
going to murder your husband.

01:00:56.638 --> 01:00:57.969
-George kill Arthur?
-You know that.

01:00:58.206 --> 01:00:59.798
What could he gain from it?

01:01:00.041 --> 01:01:01.975
For one thing, he couldn´t
get a divorce.

01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:05.737
If people thought he was dead,
he could get away from his wife.

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:07.777
-Wife? But that´s impossible.
-Why?

01:01:09.484 --> 01:01:11.418
George didn´t have a wife.

01:01:12.687 --> 01:01:14.518
He wasn´t married.

01:01:31.239 --> 01:01:34.106
Mrs. Bannister, I saved
a seat for youse.

01:01:34.342 --> 01:01:36.537
Would youse gentlemen
please move over?

01:01:39.948 --> 01:01:42.041
-Sit down.
-I just wanted to look at her.

01:01:42.283 --> 01:01:43.375
I object!

01:01:43.618 --> 01:01:47.645
The question calls for the operation
of the officer´s mind.

01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:49.357
Sustained.

01:01:49.591 --> 01:01:52.822
Very well. In the interest
of saving time, we´ll proceed.

01:01:53.061 --> 01:01:56.724
I´m sure Officer Peters
is most anxious to go home...

01:01:56.965 --> 01:01:59.627
...to his wife and family
before returning to duty.

01:01:59.868 --> 01:02:03.235
Now, Officer Peters, except
for the blood, the clothes were dry.

01:02:03.471 --> 01:02:04.870
-Yes, sir.
-They were dry...

01:02:05.106 --> 01:02:08.200
...yet the defendant stated
he threw the body into the bay.

01:02:08.443 --> 01:02:12.539
Your Honor, the district attorney isn´t
cross-examining, he´s making speeches.

01:02:12.781 --> 01:02:13.577
That isn´t so.

01:02:13.815 --> 01:02:18.411
I move for a mistrial on the grounds
that the jury is being prejudiced.

01:02:18.653 --> 01:02:22.384
These are the great Bannister´s
trial tactics in appeal for sympathy.

01:02:22.624 --> 01:02:24.888
The D.A. is beginning
to get vicious.

01:02:25.126 --> 01:02:28.994
When you two gentlemen get over your
argument, tell me who won.

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:31.425
Then I´ll decide on the objection.

01:02:33.401 --> 01:02:34.925
Objection sustained.

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:37.195
Your witness, Mr. Bannister.

01:02:37.439 --> 01:02:39.100
No questions.

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:40.739
Except...

01:02:40.975 --> 01:02:41.771
Yes.

01:02:42.744 --> 01:02:44.507
Officer Peters...

01:02:45.447 --> 01:02:48.507
...I don´t wish to keep you
from your wife and children...

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:53.653
...any more than the D.A. who was
so concerned about them a moment ago.

01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:58.081
But I would like to ask you
one question.

01:02:59.461 --> 01:03:03.192
Officer Peters, have you
a wife and children?

01:03:03.598 --> 01:03:04.826
Well...

01:03:06.334 --> 01:03:07.130
...no.

01:03:10.071 --> 01:03:12.335
Thank you. You may step down.

01:03:12.841 --> 01:03:14.809
Call your next witness.

01:03:15.844 --> 01:03:17.471
I call...

01:03:20.048 --> 01:03:21.913
...Arthur Bannister.

01:03:26.087 --> 01:03:30.456
It´s unusual, Your Honor, to put a
defense attorney on the witness stand...

01:03:30.692 --> 01:03:34.890
...but I´m confident that my client
will make no objection.

01:03:35.296 --> 01:03:37.787
He can´t make Bannister testify
against his own client, can he?

01:03:38.032 --> 01:03:39.056
Hey, what happened?

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:41.768
This keeps getting
screwier all the time.

01:03:42.003 --> 01:03:45.632
I wouldn´t take this step if there
were any more effective means...

01:03:45.874 --> 01:03:48.069
...of establishing the evidence.

01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:51.437
With my client´s
expressed permission...

01:03:52.113 --> 01:03:54.877
Mr. Bannister will take the stand.

01:03:56.584 --> 01:03:57.983
Never seen anything like that.

01:03:58.219 --> 01:04:00.278
-I thought he was smart!
-None smarter.

01:04:03.591 --> 01:04:04.751
You ain´t kidding.

01:04:04.993 --> 01:04:06.290
Do you swear to tell...

01:04:06.528 --> 01:04:08.257
...the truth and nothing
but the truth...

01:04:08.496 --> 01:04:09.485
-...so help you God?
-I do.

01:04:09.731 --> 01:04:10.857
State your name.

01:04:11.099 --> 01:04:12.589
Arthur Bannister.

01:04:17.338 --> 01:04:18.999
Mr. Bannister...

01:04:20.174 --> 01:04:21.937
...you are a member of the bar?

01:04:22.176 --> 01:04:22.972
I am.

01:04:29.651 --> 01:04:32.119
And have been for a number of years.

01:04:32.453 --> 01:04:33.943
That is correct.

01:04:37.425 --> 01:04:41.361
The defendant, Michael O´Hara, worked
as a member of the crew of your yacht?

01:04:41.596 --> 01:04:43.154
Yes.

01:04:43.398 --> 01:04:45.491
Did he seem happy in his job?

01:04:45.733 --> 01:04:47.166
I beg your pardon?

01:04:47.669 --> 01:04:51.036
-You had your back turned...
-Did he seem happy in his job?

01:04:52.707 --> 01:04:54.902
-Did you get that answer?
-Reasonably so.

01:04:55.143 --> 01:04:58.203
As a matter of fact, wasn´t he
threatening to quit?

01:04:58.446 --> 01:04:59.811
Yes.

01:05:00.081 --> 01:05:03.312
Did you know, Mr. Bannister,
that right after the murders...

01:05:04.752 --> 01:05:08.552
...right after the murders we found
the defendant´s bags packed...

01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:11.816
...in readiness for
an immediate departure?

01:05:12.727 --> 01:05:15.890
In your experience as an attorney,
would this not indicate...

01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:16.926
...premeditation?

01:05:17.165 --> 01:05:18.928
The district attorney´s
making speeches...

01:05:19.167 --> 01:05:20.634
Premeditation and flight!

01:05:20.868 --> 01:05:22.859
Making speeches
and drawing conclusions.

01:05:23.104 --> 01:05:25.231
-I am not drawing conclusions!
-You are!

01:05:25.473 --> 01:05:28.704
He is asking improper questions
in order to influence the jury.

01:05:28.943 --> 01:05:32.504
I must ask Your Honor to declare
a mistrial.

01:05:32.947 --> 01:05:34.710
Overruled.

01:05:34.949 --> 01:05:36.348
Exception.

01:05:36.684 --> 01:05:38.447
No further questions.

01:05:38.686 --> 01:05:41.052
Would Your Honor kindly explain
to the jury...

01:05:41.289 --> 01:05:45.658
...that since the district attorney´s
put me in the position of a witness...

01:05:45.893 --> 01:05:50.592
...that I am committed, as the defense
attorney, to cross examine myself?

01:05:51.966 --> 01:05:56.630
These are more of the persuasive
Mr. Bannister´s trial tactics.

01:05:57.739 --> 01:05:59.570
The jury is so instructed.

01:06:00.742 --> 01:06:01.606
Question:

01:06:01.843 --> 01:06:06.439
Mr. Bannister, did the defendant say
anything as to why he took the job?

01:06:06.681 --> 01:06:09.616
Answer: Yes, Mr. Bannister.

01:06:10.918 --> 01:06:15.787
Be reminded that Mr. Bannister had to
go to the seamen´s hiring hall...

01:06:16.024 --> 01:06:19.926
...and use his persuasive powers
to convince the defendant...

01:06:20.161 --> 01:06:21.788
...to take the job. Question:

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:26.423
Can you think of anything else
that is relevant to this inquiry?

01:06:26.668 --> 01:06:29.660
Well, I found this boy
to be clean-cut...

01:06:29.904 --> 01:06:32.532
...courageous, resourceful, honest...

01:06:32.774 --> 01:06:34.071
...hardworking. Question:

01:06:34.308 --> 01:06:37.641
Mr. Bannister, please answer
the question yes or no.

01:06:37.879 --> 01:06:42.043
Can you think of anything else
that is relevant to this issue?

01:06:42.283 --> 01:06:44.114
Answer: No.

01:06:46.854 --> 01:06:49.322
Very well.
Thank you, Mr. Bannister.

01:06:49.557 --> 01:06:50.990
You may step down.

01:06:53.027 --> 01:06:54.619
Your Honor...

01:06:54.862 --> 01:06:57.888
...I have a subpoena for a witness
who´s in the courtroom.

01:06:58.132 --> 01:07:00.032
May I have the bailiff serve it?

01:07:00.268 --> 01:07:01.292
Bailiff?

01:07:01.803 --> 01:07:04.033
You will serve the subpoena.

01:07:09.644 --> 01:07:12.772
I call Mrs. Arthur Bannister.

01:07:14.382 --> 01:07:16.907
There´s no law that says
she has to take that, is there?

01:07:17.151 --> 01:07:20.120
-Don´t be silly, she´s gotta take it.
-Who says there is?

01:07:21.155 --> 01:07:23.521
Sit down and mind your own business.

01:07:34.836 --> 01:07:36.133
Raise your right hand.

01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:38.497
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth...

01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:40.935
...the whole truth, so help you God?

01:07:41.175 --> 01:07:42.870
-I do.
-State your name.

01:07:43.111 --> 01:07:44.840
Mrs. Arthur Bannister.

01:07:46.848 --> 01:07:48.042
Mrs. Bannister...

01:07:49.117 --> 01:07:52.848
...did you ever have guards
to police your house...

01:07:53.087 --> 01:07:55.351
...or the yacht on which
you just cruised?

01:07:55.590 --> 01:07:58.081
-No.
-Why?

01:07:58.993 --> 01:08:01.154
We never felt the need of it.

01:08:01.395 --> 01:08:03.363
You have no children, have you?

01:08:05.066 --> 01:08:05.998
I have no children.

01:08:06.234 --> 01:08:07.201
You have no children.

01:08:07.435 --> 01:08:11.371
So you were never concerned about
kidnappers, is that correct?

01:08:11.806 --> 01:08:13.000
That is correct.

01:08:13.474 --> 01:08:18.002
There was a man employed in your house
and on your husband´s yacht named...

01:08:18.246 --> 01:08:19.337
...Sidney Broome?

01:08:20.782 --> 01:08:21.908
Yes.

01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:24.550
You´ve known Mr. Broome
for several years?

01:08:24.786 --> 01:08:25.684
No.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:30.118
Would it surprise you if I were to
tell you that the detective...

01:08:30.558 --> 01:08:32.457
...hired by your husband...

01:08:32.693 --> 01:08:36.026
...in divorce cases was Sidney Broome?

01:08:36.264 --> 01:08:38.698
The man you employed
in your house as a butler...

01:08:38.933 --> 01:08:42.095
...and on your husband´s yacht,
who was murdered?

01:08:42.336 --> 01:08:43.769
-I object!
-Does counsel deny...?

01:08:45.139 --> 01:08:45.969
Overruled.

01:08:46.207 --> 01:08:47.435
Does counsel deny...

01:08:47.675 --> 01:08:51.577
...that Detective Broome
is used by him in divorce cases?

01:08:52.113 --> 01:08:56.310
Mrs. Bannister, can you think of any
reason why your husband...

01:08:56.551 --> 01:09:00.009
...would want to hire a divorce
detective, other than to watch you?

01:09:00.254 --> 01:09:01.152
I object!

01:09:01.389 --> 01:09:02.481
Objection sustained.

01:09:02.723 --> 01:09:05.920
As a matter of fact, didn´t you
and your husband argue about...

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:08.424
...your showing an infatuation
for O´Hara?

01:09:08.662 --> 01:09:09.459
We did not.

01:09:09.697 --> 01:09:13.792
Isn´t it a fact that the defendant
O´Hara made advances to you...

01:09:14.035 --> 01:09:17.232
...and told you he was
infatuated with you?

01:09:20.474 --> 01:09:22.738
He was very respectful.

01:09:22.977 --> 01:09:24.808
Speak up, Mrs. Bannister.

01:09:27.148 --> 01:09:29.377
He was very respectful.

01:09:30.251 --> 01:09:32.947
And I think he was fond of me.

01:09:33.587 --> 01:09:37.786
Just what is your definition
of "fond", Mrs. Bannister?

01:09:39.594 --> 01:09:43.325
You and Michael O´Hara have kissed
each other, haven´t you?

01:09:43.663 --> 01:09:46.827
To name one occasion, you were seen
in the aquarium...

01:09:47.068 --> 01:09:49.093
...kissing each other!

01:09:49.337 --> 01:09:50.929
Do you deny that?

01:09:58.813 --> 01:10:00.110
No.

01:10:01.682 --> 01:10:03.547
No further questions.

01:10:03.784 --> 01:10:06.344
Your witness, Mr. Bannister.

01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:10.951
No questions.

01:10:14.795 --> 01:10:16.456
The State Department
refused comment.

01:10:16.697 --> 01:10:19.791
Here in San Francisco,
the fate of Black Irish O´Hara...

01:10:20.034 --> 01:10:23.401
...notorious agitator, whose trial
for the murder of George Grisby...

01:10:23.638 --> 01:10:26.630
...has held the front pages,
remains undecided.

01:10:26.874 --> 01:10:30.401
The jury, already out seven hours,
has still returned no verdict.

01:10:30.645 --> 01:10:33.773
The whole Black Irish case,
according to...

01:10:58.839 --> 01:11:00.534
How long do they take, usually?

01:11:00.775 --> 01:11:02.834
Can´t ever tell about a jury.

01:11:08.549 --> 01:11:09.743
Excuse me, Your Honor.

01:11:10.918 --> 01:11:11.714
Yes?

01:11:11.953 --> 01:11:13.318
The jury´s coming out now.

01:11:13.554 --> 01:11:15.852
Oh, thank you, Officer McNaulty.

01:11:28.102 --> 01:11:29.330
By the way...

01:11:32.373 --> 01:11:34.000
...what has Elsa been telling you?

01:11:34.241 --> 01:11:37.904
Or did you imagine that I didn´t know
she´s been coming to see you?

01:11:38.846 --> 01:11:41.178
-She asked me to trust you.
-But you don´t.

01:11:41.415 --> 01:11:44.043
-The jury has reached its verdict.
-Why?

01:11:44.986 --> 01:11:47.819
Because I know you wanted me
to be convicted.

01:11:48.356 --> 01:11:50.324
Now that it´s too late
to do anything...

01:11:50.558 --> 01:11:54.722
...I might as well tell you,
this is one case I´ve enjoyed losing.

01:11:55.796 --> 01:11:59.061
I´m coming to see you in the death
house, Michael. Every day.

01:12:00.267 --> 01:12:02.997
Our little visits will be great fun.

01:12:03.237 --> 01:12:05.171
I´m going to ask for a stay
of execution.

01:12:05.406 --> 01:12:07.499
I really hope it´ll be granted.

01:12:08.309 --> 01:12:11.335
I want you to live as long
as possible before you die.

01:12:11.579 --> 01:12:14.275
You´re talking kind of tough,
aren´t you, Mr. Bannister?

01:12:14.515 --> 01:12:18.747
I´ve got an edge. I know you´re
going to the gas chamber.

01:12:19.387 --> 01:12:20.786
Don´t be so sure.

01:12:21.455 --> 01:12:23.423
I know the killer.

01:12:24.658 --> 01:12:26.819
I know who murdered Grisby.

01:12:28.462 --> 01:12:29.986
Michael?

01:12:38.873 --> 01:12:41.467
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
do you have a verdict?

01:12:41.709 --> 01:12:43.267
-We, the jury...
-Wait a minute!

01:12:45.079 --> 01:12:46.706
Poison! Poison pills!

01:12:47.882 --> 01:12:49.440
Bring him to my chambers!

01:12:52.887 --> 01:12:54.354
Get that doctor!

01:12:54.588 --> 01:12:57.489
I talked to the doctor.
Said to keep him on his feet.

01:12:57.725 --> 01:13:00.353
-We need help.
-I can´t hold this crowd by myself.

01:13:00.594 --> 01:13:03.961
The way I understand it, he´ll be
all right if we keep him moving.

01:13:04.198 --> 01:13:06.666
-I need help!
-lf he sleeps, he´s done for.

01:13:06.901 --> 01:13:08.027
Done for? Well!

01:13:08.269 --> 01:13:11.534
I need two officers to control
the crowd in my courtroom!

01:13:11.772 --> 01:13:13.672
I´ll try and get rid of the reporters.

01:13:13.908 --> 01:13:18.777
You´ll do no such thing! I´ll see
them. I´ll see the reporters myself.

01:13:19.046 --> 01:13:20.479
We have to prepare a statement.

01:13:20.714 --> 01:13:22.511
That´s it, keep him walking.

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:24.615
All right, Mr. Galloway.

01:13:43.537 --> 01:13:45.004
No pictures, please!

01:14:24.145 --> 01:14:27.376
Stay close together while I
escort you out to dinner.

01:14:27.615 --> 01:14:28.775
-It's him.
-What can we do?

01:14:29.016 --> 01:14:30.210
We gotta think of something.

01:14:30.718 --> 01:14:33.687
That´s another jury
from another trial across there.

01:14:33.921 --> 01:14:35.513
He´s walking out with them!

01:14:37.124 --> 01:14:40.992
The judge hopes you will arrive at
a verdict as soon as possible.

01:14:45.065 --> 01:14:46.896
That way! Come on.

01:14:47.401 --> 01:14:50.768
My goodness! My window!
My chessboard.

01:14:51.005 --> 01:14:53.030
McNaulty! Officer Fishbein!

01:14:53.274 --> 01:14:55.265
I expect a full report from you.

01:14:55.509 --> 01:14:57.477
Get off the floor, Officer Fishbein.

01:14:57.711 --> 01:14:59.508
-No pictures.
-What happened?

01:14:59.747 --> 01:15:02.978
That woman´s too nice-looking
to have stolen that jewelry.

01:15:03.217 --> 01:15:06.345
Jury duty´s such a responsibility,
don´t you think?

01:15:07.621 --> 01:15:11.921
You were told not to talk about the
case. Don´t let it happen again.

01:15:27.575 --> 01:15:28.371
Elsa!

01:17:52.553 --> 01:17:53.417
Hello, Li?

01:17:53.854 --> 01:17:54.843
Hello.

01:18:23.751 --> 01:18:26.914
-Why did you do it?
-I didn´t. I´m not guilty.

01:18:27.287 --> 01:18:30.848
Oh, the pills, you mean. The pills.

01:18:31.091 --> 01:18:33.924
I saw you begging me to swallow.
Begging me with your eyes.

01:18:34.161 --> 01:18:37.995
You didn´t mean for me to take
them all. I held some back.

01:18:38.232 --> 01:18:41.360
I took too many of the pills.
I´m faint.

01:18:41.602 --> 01:18:43.263
And now what?

01:18:44.405 --> 01:18:46.270
Don´t you know they´ll catch you?

01:18:46.507 --> 01:18:48.407
I´ve got to find that gun.

01:18:48.642 --> 01:18:50.667
Gun? What gun?

01:18:50.911 --> 01:18:53.675
The gun that killed Grisby.
It´ll prove I´m innocent.

01:18:56.116 --> 01:18:58.914
Well, I phoned our servant Li.

01:18:59.153 --> 01:19:01.951
We´re trying to arrange something.
Someplace to take you.

01:19:02.189 --> 01:19:04.749
Just wait here quietly
and watch the play.

01:19:17.337 --> 01:19:18.235
The police.

01:19:23.143 --> 01:19:24.872
Put your arms around me.

01:19:52.372 --> 01:19:53.566
Don´t move.

01:20:01.215 --> 01:20:02.147
Don´t you move.

01:20:03.817 --> 01:20:05.307
I told you not to move.
I mean it.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.148
I found the gun.

01:20:08.755 --> 01:20:11.019
You killed Grisby. Yes!

01:20:12.459 --> 01:20:14.450
You´re the killer.

01:20:30.544 --> 01:20:31.943
I was right.

01:20:32.179 --> 01:20:35.012
She was the killer.
She killed Grisby.

01:20:35.249 --> 01:20:37.080
Now she was going to kill me.

01:20:37.317 --> 01:20:42.016
Li and his friends smuggled me out and
hid me where I´d be safe from the cops.

01:20:42.256 --> 01:20:43.587
Not safe from her.

01:20:43.824 --> 01:20:46.019
One of the Chinese worked
at an amusement park.

01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:50.458
It was closed for the season. An empty
amusement park makes a good hideout...

01:20:50.697 --> 01:20:53.063
...and she wanted me hidden.

01:20:55.736 --> 01:20:59.137
Well, I came to...

01:21:00.207 --> 01:21:02.368
...in the crazy house.

01:21:02.609 --> 01:21:04.736
And for a while there...

01:21:04.978 --> 01:21:07.412
...I thought it was me that was crazy.

01:21:07.648 --> 01:21:11.675
After what I´d been through,
anything crazy at all...

01:21:11.919 --> 01:21:13.045
...seemed natural.

01:21:13.287 --> 01:21:17.883
But now I was sane
on one subject. Her.

01:21:18.125 --> 01:21:19.490
I knew about her.

01:21:19.726 --> 01:21:22.456
She planned to kill Bannister.

01:21:22.696 --> 01:21:23.993
She and Grisby.

01:21:24.231 --> 01:21:27.359
Grisby was to do it for a share of
Bannister´s money.

01:21:27.601 --> 01:21:29.068
That´s what Grisby thought.

01:21:29.303 --> 01:21:33.034
Of course she meant to kill Grisby
too, after he´d served his purpose.

01:21:33.273 --> 01:21:37.334
Poor howling idiot, he never even
did that. He went and shot Broome.

01:21:37.578 --> 01:21:39.876
And that was not part of the plan.

01:21:40.113 --> 01:21:43.014
Broome might have got to
the police before he died.

01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:47.584
And if the cops traced it to Grisby
and the cops made him talk...

01:21:47.955 --> 01:21:49.354
...he´d spill everything...

01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:54.323
...and she´d be finished. So she
had to shut up Grisby, but quick.

01:21:55.228 --> 01:21:57.162
And I was the fall guy.

01:22:33.433 --> 01:22:35.424
In here.
We´re less likely to be heard.

01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:38.137
I thought it was your husband
you wanted to kill.

01:22:38.372 --> 01:22:40.806
Why don´t you try to understand?

01:22:41.041 --> 01:22:43.532
George was supposed to
take care of Arthur.

01:22:43.777 --> 01:22:47.008
But he lost his silly head
and shot Broome.

01:22:48.248 --> 01:22:51.115
After that, I knew
I couldn´t trust him.

01:22:51.785 --> 01:22:53.343
He was mad.

01:22:53.887 --> 01:22:54.785
He had to be shot.

01:22:55.489 --> 01:22:56.786
And what about me?

01:22:57.024 --> 01:22:58.651
We could have gone off together.

01:22:58.892 --> 01:23:01.087
Into the sunrise.

01:23:01.795 --> 01:23:04.491
You and me? Or you and Grisby?

01:23:04.731 --> 01:23:05.527
I love you.

01:23:05.766 --> 01:23:10.669
One who follows his nature keeps
his original nature in the end.

01:23:11.772 --> 01:23:15.435
But haven´t you heard ever of
something better to follow?

01:23:19.012 --> 01:23:20.445
No.

01:23:25.752 --> 01:23:27.652
I knew I´d find you two together.

01:23:27.888 --> 01:23:31.881
If I hadn´t, Elsa, I might have gone on
playing it your way.

01:23:32.125 --> 01:23:33.285
You didn´t know that...

01:23:33.527 --> 01:23:35.188
...but you did plan for me
to follow you.

01:23:35.429 --> 01:23:36.418
You´ve been drinking.

01:23:36.663 --> 01:23:39.996
I presume you think that if you
murder me here...

01:23:40.233 --> 01:23:42.258
...your sailor friend will get
the blame.

01:23:42.502 --> 01:23:44.094
You´ll be free to
spend my money.

01:23:45.305 --> 01:23:48.672
Well, dear, you aren´t the only one
who wants me to die.

01:23:48.909 --> 01:23:51.139
Our good friend,
the district attorney...

01:23:51.378 --> 01:23:54.347
...is just itching to open a letter
that I left with him.

01:23:55.048 --> 01:23:57.573
The letter tells all
about you, lover.

01:23:58.685 --> 01:24:01.483
So you´d be foolish to
fire that gun.

01:24:03.490 --> 01:24:05.617
With these mirrors it´s
difficult to tell.

01:24:05.892 --> 01:24:08.383
You are aiming at me, aren´t you?

01:24:08.862 --> 01:24:10.591
I´m aiming at you, lover.

01:24:11.565 --> 01:24:14.261
Of course, killing you
is killing myself.

01:24:15.035 --> 01:24:16.832
It´s the same thing.

01:24:18.371 --> 01:24:21.602
But you know, I´m pretty
tired of both of us.

01:24:44.931 --> 01:24:47.991
You know, for a smart girl,
you make a lot of mistakes.

01:24:49.069 --> 01:24:51.264
You should have let me live.

01:24:51.805 --> 01:24:53.397
You´re gonna need a good lawyer.

01:25:01.348 --> 01:25:04.943
He and George...

01:25:08.155 --> 01:25:09.645
...and now me!

01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:14.054
Like the sharks,
mad with their own blood.

01:25:14.294 --> 01:25:17.127
Chewing away at their own selves.

01:25:18.398 --> 01:25:19.888
It´s true.

01:25:23.036 --> 01:25:25.561
I made a lot of mistakes.

01:25:26.106 --> 01:25:29.166
You said the world´s bad
and we can´t run away from that.

01:25:29.409 --> 01:25:30.467
You´re right there.

01:25:30.710 --> 01:25:35.443
But you said we can´t fight it. We
must deal with the badness, make terms.

01:25:35.682 --> 01:25:37.912
And then the badness deal with you.

01:25:38.151 --> 01:25:41.120
Make its own terms
in the end, surely.

01:25:41.354 --> 01:25:44.915
You can fight, but what good is it?

01:25:47.494 --> 01:25:48.722
Goodbye.

01:25:48.962 --> 01:25:50.486
You mean we can´t win?

01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:53.665
No, we can´t win.

01:25:55.001 --> 01:25:57.333
Give my love to the sunrise.

01:25:57.571 --> 01:26:00.096
We can´t lose either.

01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:01.807
Only if we quit.

01:26:02.042 --> 01:26:04.033
And you´re not going to?

01:26:04.277 --> 01:26:05.642
Not again.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.975
Oh, Michael...

01:26:10.984 --> 01:26:12.508
...I´m afraid.

01:26:15.622 --> 01:26:16.748
Michael?

01:26:18.358 --> 01:26:19.916
Come back here.

01:26:20.627 --> 01:26:21.821
Michael?

01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:24.196
Please!

01:26:25.098 --> 01:26:26.827
I don´t want to die!

01:26:28.335 --> 01:26:30.803
I don´t want to die!

01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:42.013
I went to call the cops, but I knew
she´d be dead before they got there.

01:26:42.249 --> 01:26:43.978
And I´d be free.

01:26:44.217 --> 01:26:49.120
Bannister´s note to the D.A. fixed it.
I´d be innocent, officially.

01:26:49.356 --> 01:26:51.722
But that´s a big word, innocent.

01:26:51.958 --> 01:26:54.483
Stupid is more like it.

01:26:54.728 --> 01:26:59.324
Well, everybody is somebody´s fool.

01:26:59.566 --> 01:27:01.966
The only way to stay out of trouble
is to grow old.

01:27:02.202 --> 01:27:04.636
So I guess I´ll concentrate on that.

01:27:04.871 --> 01:27:07.635
Maybe I´ll live so long...

01:27:07.874 --> 01:27:10.342
...that I´ll forget her.

01:27:10.577 --> 01:27:13.546
Maybe I´ll die trying.
