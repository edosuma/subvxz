WEBVTT

00:40.098 --> 00:42.609
-Good morning .
-Morning .

00:42.818 --> 00:46.416
-State your name for the record .
-Daniel Ocean.

00:46.751 --> 00:50.600
Thank you. The purpose of this
hearing is to determine...

00:50.809 --> 00:53.905
...whether you are
likely to break the law again.

00:54.114 --> 00:59.009
This was your first conviction,
but you were implicated...

00:59.219 --> 01:01.688
...in a dozen other schemes
and frauds.

01:01.896 --> 01:04.489
What can you tell us about this?

01:05.369 --> 01:08.297
As you say, ma'am,
I was never charged .

01:09.010 --> 01:11.352
We're trying to find out...

01:11.562 --> 01:14.490
...if there was a reason
for committing this crime...

01:14.699 --> 01:17.670
...or just a reason
you got caught this time.

01:17.879 --> 01:22.690
My wife left me. I was upset.
I got into a self-destructive pattern.

01:24.030 --> 01:28.507
If released, is it likely you'd fall
back into a similar pattern?

01:28.715 --> 01:33.318
She left me once. I doubt
she'd do it again just for kicks.

01:33.527 --> 01:37.878
Mr. Ocean, what do you think
you would do if released?

03:02.812 --> 03:04.319
-Chips, please.
-Sure.

03:07.331 --> 03:11.097
-Change 1 50. Quarters or nickels?
-Quarters are fine.

03:14.025 --> 03:15.908
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

03:22.979 --> 03:27.330
Twenty. Dealer has 1 9. Good start.

03:31.598 --> 03:35.155
-I'm going on break now.
-Here. Thank you very much.

03:36.494 --> 03:39.297
-Good luck.
-You have a good one.

03:40.175 --> 03:43.104
-How are you, sir?
-Hello, Frank.

03:46.954 --> 03:51.765
I beg your pardon. You must have me
confused with someone else.

03:51.974 --> 03:55.781
My name is Ramon.
As you can see right here.

03:59.254 --> 04:01.974
-My mistake.
-No problem, sir.

04:02.350 --> 04:04.903
The table's cold anyway.

04:05.112 --> 04:09.672
You might want to try the lounge
at Caesars. Gets busy after 1 :00.

04:09.881 --> 04:11.722
-1 :00?
-Yes, sir.

04:12.601 --> 04:14.400
Thanks, Ramon.

04:15.864 --> 04:17.119
Thank you.

04:26.408 --> 04:30.508
-Checking up on current events?
-Ramon.

04:30.718 --> 04:35.696
Glad to meet you. Frank Catton
can't get past the gaming board .

04:35.905 --> 04:38.291
-You just got out?
-This afternoon.

04:38.834 --> 04:39.880
You seen him?

04:40.299 --> 04:45.235
I heard he was teaching movie stars
how to play cards. Why?

04:45.905 --> 04:47.579
You have a plan already?

04:47.914 --> 04:51.052
Are you kidding?
I just became a citizen again.

04:51.260 --> 04:52.599
Officer Brooks...

04:52.934 --> 04:57.537
...this is Danny Ocean. I was told
to contact you within 24 hours.

04:58.457 --> 05:01.386
No, sir, I haven't
been getting in trouble.

05:02.766 --> 05:05.110
No, sir, I haven't been drinking .

05:06.114 --> 05:09.419
No, sir, I wouldn't even think
about leaving the state.

05:23.560 --> 05:27.117
Hey, Russ! Rusty. What's up, man?

05:30.632 --> 05:34.397
Let me ask you a question.
Are you incorporated?

05:34.606 --> 05:38.372
You should think about it.
I talked to my manager--

05:38.790 --> 05:42.305
-Bernie?
-Not Bernie. My business manager.

05:42.556 --> 05:45.318
Actually, they' re both named Bernie.

05:45.652 --> 05:49.627
He said what we do could
be considered research...

05:49.878 --> 05:53.937
...for a future gig, so I could
make it a tax write-off.

05:54.145 --> 05:58.036
The one thing is, and this is
his thing and it's stupid...

05:58.246 --> 06:01.216
...but I'd have to pay you by check.

06:06.320 --> 06:08.664
Or we could just stick to cash.

06:08.999 --> 06:11.509
Yeah, let's just stick to cash.

06:19.500 --> 06:23.266
We'll begin with five-card draw.
Everyone remember that?

06:23.516 --> 06:26.362
Who wants to start us out? Josh?

06:29.040 --> 06:31.173
Josh. To the left.

06:31.717 --> 06:32.972
Deal to your left.

06:33.182 --> 06:34.772
-Shane?
-Hit me.

06:34.980 --> 06:37.701
-It's not blackjack.
-Dude!

06:37.909 --> 06:42.009
Looking at them doesn't change them.
You know what you have.

06:44.353 --> 06:46.319
-Left. Left.
-Left, I'll get it.

06:46.528 --> 06:48.662
Lady bets. Let's keep it moving .

06:48.872 --> 06:51.382
-Blue.
-Blue, that's a 50.

06:51.591 --> 06:53.307
-I'll call?
-Okay.

06:53.641 --> 06:55.566
Shane's calling. 50.

06:55.859 --> 06:58.704
What the hell, it's only
pocket change.

06:59.122 --> 07:02.637
Betting's your business.
Pretend it's for a reason.

07:02.888 --> 07:04.227
Yeah, thanks, man.

07:04.896 --> 07:06.569
-Right.
-How many?

07:06.904 --> 07:10.838
-Four.
-You don't want four. You wanna fold.

07:11.088 --> 07:12.720
-I wanna fold?
-Fold.

07:13.347 --> 07:14.394
Is that good?

07:14.687 --> 07:17.992
You're done. Let's take that.
You're done.

07:18.451 --> 07:21.381
You're done. You have three pairs.

07:21.716 --> 07:25.230
You can't have six cards
in a five-card game.

07:25.565 --> 07:27.656
-Maybe one was mine.
-Wasn't me.

07:27.866 --> 07:28.912
Fellas!

07:29.331 --> 07:32.259
All reds.

07:33.598 --> 07:35.188
What up, dog?

07:40.752 --> 07:45.272
I'm gonna love spending your money.
I'm gonna get my car washed .

07:58.283 --> 08:01.965
-How's the game going?
-Longest hour of my life.

08:03.179 --> 08:06.777
-What?
-I'm running away with your wife.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.743
Great.

08:18.073 --> 08:21.922
Isn't that hard, crossing over
from television to film?

08:22.132 --> 08:24.098
Not for me, dude.

08:25.479 --> 08:27.989
Hey, Russ. We got another player...

08:28.323 --> 08:30.206
...if that's cool with you.

08:32.299 --> 08:36.441
What do you do for a living?
lf you don't mind me asking .

08:36.650 --> 08:38.909
Why would I mind you asking?

08:39.159 --> 08:40.500
Two cards.

08:40.750 --> 08:43.302
I just got out of prison.

08:44.935 --> 08:47.988
-Really?
-Why were you in prison?

08:48.574 --> 08:50.624
I stole things.

08:50.834 --> 08:54.348
You stole things? Like jewels?

08:54.724 --> 08:57.863
Incan matrimonial head masks.

08:58.867 --> 09:02.884
-Any money in lncan matrimonial--?
-Head masks. Some.

09:03.092 --> 09:07.151
Don't let him fool you. There's
loads if you can move them.

09:07.360 --> 09:11.628
-I'll take one. But you can't.
-My fence seemed confident.

09:11.837 --> 09:15.268
-With cash you don't need a fence.
-Some lack vision.

09:15.477 --> 09:17.904
Probably everybody in cellblock E.

09:18.112 --> 09:19.870
That's $500.

09:20.665 --> 09:24.515
-What's the first lesson in poker?
-Never bet on the--

09:24.723 --> 09:27.317
-No, leave emotion at the door.
-Right.

09:27.527 --> 09:30.330
Today's lesson:
How to draw out the bluff.

09:30.539 --> 09:32.756
That much money early in the game....

09:32.966 --> 09:36.439
He has nothing better than
a pair of face cards.

09:36.606 --> 09:38.070
Barry?

09:41.041 --> 09:42.380
All right.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.640
I fold.

09:46.773 --> 09:49.283
-Josh?
-Don't worry, I'm game.

09:49.493 --> 09:54.221
I will see your $500
and I will raise you another...

09:54.848 --> 09:58.278
-...$500 of my own.
-That's a very handsome bet.

09:58.530 --> 10:04.220
Careful, don't push him too high,
too fast. I Keep him on the leash.

10:04.430 --> 10:06.396
-Holly?
-Call.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.572
Call.

10:09.408 --> 10:11.081
And I'll call.

10:14.597 --> 10:18.446
I'll see your $500
and raise you $2000.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.630
Guys, you do what you like.
That's a lot of money.

10:22.838 --> 10:28.027
I'm staying in. He's trying to buy
his way out of his bluff.

10:29.366 --> 10:32.085
-Josh?
-Two.

10:37.399 --> 10:38.864
Thattagirl. Call.

10:39.407 --> 10:42.085
-Call.
-Call.

10:44.972 --> 10:46.687
Let's see them.

10:46.897 --> 10:52.754
I'm not sure what four nines does,
but the ace, I think, is pretty high.

10:53.884 --> 10:56.227
Thanks for the tip on bluffing .

10:56.812 --> 11:01.791
Hey, Topher! How about an autograph?
Come on, real quick.

11:17.523 --> 11:21.414
-God, I'm bored .
-You look bored .

11:22.125 --> 11:25.849
How was the clink?
You get the cookies I sent?

11:26.351 --> 11:29.322
Why do you think I
came to see you first?

11:30.158 --> 11:32.502
-So tell me.
-It's tricky.

11:32.836 --> 11:37.397
It's never been done before.
It'll need planning and a large crew.

11:38.359 --> 11:41.664
-Guns?
-Not quite. High security. The take--

11:42.166 --> 11:44.008
-The target?
-Eight figures.

11:44.216 --> 11:46.099
What's the target?

11:47.605 --> 11:50.744
When was the last time
you were in Vegas?

11:50.952 --> 11:53.756
You want to knock over a casino?

12:07.061 --> 12:09.027
The vault at the Bellagio.

12:13.880 --> 12:17.897
If I'm reading this right,
and I'd like to think I am...

12:18.567 --> 12:22.834
...this is probably the least
accessible vault ever designed .

12:24.006 --> 12:25.972
You said three casinos?

12:26.223 --> 12:32.123
These feed into the Mirage and MGM
Grand, but every dime ends up there.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.512
The Bellagio and the Mirage.

12:35.888 --> 12:39.654
-These are Terry Benedict's places.
-Yes, they are.

12:40.365 --> 12:43.168
-Think he'll mind?
-More than somewhat.

12:43.378 --> 12:47.520
You'd need at least 1 2 guys
doing a combination of cons.

12:47.728 --> 12:49.361
Like what, you think?

12:49.570 --> 12:54.842
Off the top of my head, I'd say you're
looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown...

12:55.050 --> 12:57.477
...a Miss Daisy and a Leon Spinks.

12:57.729 --> 13:01.578
Not to mention the biggest
Ella Fitzgerald ever.

13:01.786 --> 13:04.716
Where will you get
the money to back this?

13:04.925 --> 13:07.979
Hit these three casinos,
we'll get our bankroll.

13:08.189 --> 13:10.615
Benedict's got a list of enemies.

13:10.866 --> 13:14.674
But enemies with loose
cash and nothing to lose?

13:17.937 --> 13:19.527
-Reuben.
-Reuben.

13:19.778 --> 13:21.242
Hey.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.841
Oscar, lower it a bit, would you?

13:25.468 --> 13:28.522
Sorry. You guys done?
Find what you want?

13:28.732 --> 13:31.786
We'll take these for the night
to make copies.

13:31.995 --> 13:35.008
-Whatever you need .
-Appreciate it.

13:42.497 --> 13:43.752
What?

13:45.300 --> 13:46.807
I need a reason.

13:47.643 --> 13:50.112
And don't say money. Why do this?

13:50.278 --> 13:51.367
Why not do it?

13:57.517 --> 14:01.408
I just left the joint after
losing four years of my life...

14:01.617 --> 14:04.672
...and you're cold-decking
Teen Beat cover boys.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.814
Because the house always wins.

14:09.023 --> 14:12.244
Play long enough,
the house takes you.

14:12.454 --> 14:18.061
Unless, when that perfect hand comes,
you bet big. Then you take the house.

14:21.073 --> 14:23.960
-You practiced that speech?
-Did I rush it?

14:24.169 --> 14:26.721
It was good .
The Teen Beat thing was harsh.

14:30.571 --> 14:32.704
I wonder what Reuben will say.

14:33.792 --> 14:36.344
You're out of your damn minds!

14:38.227 --> 14:39.859
You're both of you nuts!

14:40.068 --> 14:45.549
I know more about casino security
than any man. I invented it.

14:45.758 --> 14:47.641
And it cannot be beaten.

14:47.850 --> 14:50.988
They got cameras and watchers,
they got locks.

14:51.197 --> 14:53.038
They got timers, vaults.

14:53.373 --> 14:57.055
They got enough armed
personnel to occupy Paris!

14:57.891 --> 15:00.109
Okay, bad example.

15:00.318 --> 15:02.033
It's never been tried .

15:03.080 --> 15:07.682
It's been tried .
A few guys even came close.

15:07.891 --> 15:11.614
You know the three most successful
robberies in Vegas?

15:11.782 --> 15:13.832
Number three, the bronze medal.

15:14.042 --> 15:17.180
Pencil neck grabs a
lockbox at the Horseshoe.

15:17.388 --> 15:19.606
Grab the guy in the suit!

15:20.401 --> 15:24.209
He got two steps closer to
the door than anyone before.

15:24.418 --> 15:25.589
Leave the money!

15:25.799 --> 15:27.765
Second most successful robbery:

15:27.974 --> 15:32.493
The Flamingo in '7 1. This guy
actually tasted fresh oxygen...

15:32.701 --> 15:34.334
...before they grabbed him.

15:35.045 --> 15:39.731
Of course, he was breathing out
ofa hose for the next three weeks.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.781
Goddamn hippie.

15:42.116 --> 15:45.254
And the closest any man
has ever come...

15:45.547 --> 15:47.513
...to robbing a Las Vegas casino...

15:47.765 --> 15:50.777
... was outside of Caesars in '87.

15:51.781 --> 15:52.952
He came...

15:53.956 --> 15:55.295
...he grabbed...

15:56.132 --> 15:57.973
...they conquered.

16:03.161 --> 16:07.805
But what am I saying? You guys
are pros. The best.

16:08.140 --> 16:11.027
I'm sure you can make
it out of the casino.

16:11.278 --> 16:13.621
Of course, lest we forget...

16:13.914 --> 16:19.019
...once you're out, you're still
in the middle of the fucking desert!

16:19.478 --> 16:21.236
You're right. He's right.

16:21.486 --> 16:24.123
Our eyes were bigger than
our stomachs.

16:24.332 --> 16:27.386
-That's what it is. Ego.
-Yeah, blah, blah.

16:27.596 --> 16:30.566
-Thanks for lunch.
-The nicoise was delicious.

16:30.733 --> 16:34.248
-Sorry to bother you.
-Look, we go way back...

16:34.499 --> 16:37.637
...and I owe you from the thing
with the guy.

16:37.846 --> 16:40.565
-Our pleasure.
-I'd never been to Belize.

16:40.775 --> 16:45.503
Give Dominic your addresses.
I got some furniture to send you.

16:46.674 --> 16:52.574
Just out of curiosity, which casinos
did you geniuses pick to rob?

16:53.829 --> 16:57.176
The Bellagio, the Mirage and
the MGM Grand .

16:59.100 --> 17:01.694
Those are Terry Benedict's casinos.

17:02.699 --> 17:05.000
-Is that right?
-That's right.

17:05.836 --> 17:07.175
You guys...

17:08.848 --> 17:11.609
...what do you got against
Terry Benedict?

17:11.861 --> 17:15.040
What do you have against
him, is the question.

17:15.669 --> 17:20.313
He torpedoed my casino.
Muscled me out.

17:20.857 --> 17:26.003
Now he's gonna blow it up next month
to make way for some monstrosity.

17:26.338 --> 17:29.853
-I see what you're doing .
-What are we doing?

17:31.065 --> 17:35.835
If you're gonna steal from Terry
Benedict, you better goddamn know.

17:36.045 --> 17:40.145
This used to be civilized .
You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you.

17:40.355 --> 17:42.237
But Benedict....

17:43.242 --> 17:47.049
At the end of it, he'd better not
know you're involved .

17:47.341 --> 17:52.154
Because he'll kill you,
then he'll go to work on you.

17:53.073 --> 17:56.630
That's why we have to be
very careful, very precise.

17:56.922 --> 17:58.220
Well-funded .

17:59.224 --> 18:01.400
You gotta be nuts too.

18:01.735 --> 18:05.919
And you're gonna need a
crew as nuts as you are.

18:09.265 --> 18:11.023
Who do you got in mind?

18:11.776 --> 18:15.249
-Alright, who 's in?
-Frank C. is in.

18:15.583 --> 18:21.147
Frank has bronchitis and is applying
for a transfer to warmer climates.

18:26.921 --> 18:27.884
Drivers?

18:28.135 --> 18:30.771
-I talked to the Malloys.
-Mormon twins?

18:30.980 --> 18:33.449
They're in Utah, off the job.

18:34.118 --> 18:37.088
They're having
trouble filling the hours.

18:52.067 --> 18:54.870
-Waiting, sweetheart.
-Good. Go.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.419
-I'm waiting .
-Why?

18:56.628 --> 18:58.553
-You're a little girl !
-Relax.

18:58.720 --> 19:03.280
I'm going to get out and
drop you like third-period French.

19:03.573 --> 19:04.786
Relax.

19:42.568 --> 19:45.036
-Electronics?
-Livingston Dell.

19:45.329 --> 19:49.346
He 's been doing surveillance
work for the FBI mob squad.

19:49.554 --> 19:52.233
-How are his nerves?
-Not so bad.

19:52.442 --> 19:54.492
Move in a little bit.

19:56.207 --> 20:00.140
-Don't-- Don't touch that.
-Why not?

20:01.144 --> 20:04.784
Do you see me grabbing your
gun and waving it around?

20:05.035 --> 20:07.546
Hey, RadioShack. Relax.

20:17.545 --> 20:18.634
Munitions.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.893
-Phil Turrentine.
-Dead .

20:21.311 --> 20:23.905
-No shit. On the job?
-Skin cancer.

20:24.114 --> 20:27.210
-You send flowers?
-Dated his wife for a while.

20:27.963 --> 20:29.512
Basher's in town.

20:30.599 --> 20:33.151
There may be an issue
with availability.

20:39.428 --> 20:41.059
All right, chaps...

20:42.398 --> 20:44.364
...hang on to your knickers.

21:02.523 --> 21:04.782
Oh, leave it out!

21:07.126 --> 21:10.597
You tossers! You had one job to do!

21:14.991 --> 21:17.208
That's all you used in the event?

21:17.543 --> 21:21.057
-You accusing me of booby-trapping?
-Well?

21:21.309 --> 21:25.116
Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style.
Isn't that right?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.082
Basher?

21:27.627 --> 21:29.468
Peck. ATF.

21:29.928 --> 21:31.476
Let me venture a guess.

21:31.769 --> 21:37.124
Simple G-4 mainliner, back wound,
quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet.

21:37.794 --> 21:40.806
Let me ask you this.
You search this scumbag...

21:41.140 --> 21:44.153
...for booby traps?
I mean, really searched .

21:44.488 --> 21:45.910
Stand back.

21:46.245 --> 21:47.751
Here we go.

21:48.169 --> 21:50.555
-Find Griggs. I need him.
-Who?

21:50.973 --> 21:52.688
Just find him, will you?

21:54.236 --> 21:57.792
Can you put something together
with what I gave you?

21:58.002 --> 21:59.174
Done.

22:00.722 --> 22:03.776
-Is Danny about?
-He's around the corner.

22:03.985 --> 22:07.918
Terrific. It'll be nice working with
proper villains again.

22:08.336 --> 22:10.512
Everybody down! Get down!

22:12.478 --> 22:14.863
They weren't expecting that shit!

22:15.281 --> 22:16.788
-Nice work.
-Thanks.

22:35.699 --> 22:39.883
-Which one's the Amazing Yen?
-The little Chinese guy.

22:44.360 --> 22:47.373
-Who else is on the list?
-He is the list.

22:51.723 --> 22:54.067
It doesn't seem that diff--

23:03.397 --> 23:06.367
-We got a grease man.
-We got a grease man.

23:11.388 --> 23:12.895
We need Saul .

23:13.146 --> 23:16.911
-He got out of the game a year ago.
-He get religion?

23:17.246 --> 23:18.585
Ulcers.

23:21.095 --> 23:24.108
-You could ask him.
-Hey, I could ask him.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.944
I saw you at the paddock...

23:55.278 --> 24:00.257
...before the second race, outside the
men's room when I placed my bet.

24:01.512 --> 24:04.650
I saw you before you even
got up this morning .

24:05.110 --> 24:08.290
-How you been, Saul?
-Never better.

24:08.541 --> 24:10.382
What's with the orange?

24:10.592 --> 24:15.235
-My doctor says I need vitamins.
-Why don't you take vitamins?

24:15.570 --> 24:18.039
You come here to give me a physical?

24:18.625 --> 24:20.466
Box seats. Come on.

24:33.143 --> 24:37.619
You gonna tell me? Or should I
say no and get it over with?

24:37.829 --> 24:41.636
You're the best. You're in
Cooperstown. What do you want?

24:41.846 --> 24:44.648
Nothing. I got a duplex now.

24:44.941 --> 24:47.327
I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish.

24:47.535 --> 24:51.719
I'm seeing a lady who works the
counter at Macy's.

24:51.929 --> 24:53.435
I've changed .

24:57.451 --> 25:01.593
Guys like us don't change.
We stay sharp or get sloppy.

25:02.137 --> 25:03.854
Quit conning me.

25:04.145 --> 25:06.489
That your hound way in the rear?

25:06.698 --> 25:09.543
He breaks late. Everyone knows this.

25:13.142 --> 25:16.656
You going to treat me
like a grownup at least?

25:16.865 --> 25:18.957
Tell me what the scam is?

25:48.914 --> 25:52.512
Exhibit C: His belt as
king of the heavyweight crown.

25:52.972 --> 25:56.906
Lennox Lewis has proved
he 's the champion.

25:58.328 --> 26:02.219
Saul makes 10.
Ten should do it, don't you think?

26:03.432 --> 26:05.399
You think we need one more?

26:06.487 --> 26:08.370
You think we need one more.

26:10.546 --> 26:12.721
Alright, we'll get one more.

27:30.835 --> 27:34.015
Hello, Linus. Whose is this?

27:35.354 --> 27:38.492
-Who are you?
-A friend of Bobby Caldwell's.

27:39.789 --> 27:43.178
You're either in or out. Right now.

27:46.107 --> 27:50.207
-What is it?
-It's a plane ticket. A job offer.

27:51.462 --> 27:55.185
-You're pretty trusting .
-Bobby has faith in you.

27:55.437 --> 27:57.696
Fathers are like that.

27:58.157 --> 28:02.131
He didn't tell you? He doesn't
want me trading on his name.

28:02.340 --> 28:04.976
Do this job, he'll be
trading on yours.

28:05.186 --> 28:08.784
Don't, and you can go back to
feeling up stockbrokers.

28:08.993 --> 28:11.294
Can you get the check, please?

28:14.641 --> 28:16.775
That's the best lift you've made yet.

28:17.068 --> 28:18.699
Las Vegas?

28:19.076 --> 28:20.707
America's playground .

29:06.690 --> 29:09.870
Did you guys get a group
rate or something?

29:16.228 --> 29:18.697
Saul, do you get out to Utah much?

29:20.287 --> 29:22.631
Not as often as I'd like.

29:22.965 --> 29:27.777
Check it out. I think you'd dig Provo.
You could do well there.

29:28.112 --> 29:29.952
I'll look into it.

29:30.957 --> 29:35.600
Welcome to Las Vegas.
Has everybody eaten? Good .

29:35.977 --> 29:37.818
Everybody sober?

29:38.404 --> 29:42.922
Close enough. Before we start,
nobody's on the line yet.

29:43.132 --> 29:47.734
What I'm about to propose is highly
lucrative and highly dangerous.

29:47.943 --> 29:50.662
If that's not your brand of vodka...

29:50.872 --> 29:55.642
...eat as much as you like and have
a safe journey. No hard feelings.

29:55.810 --> 29:57.608
Otherwise, come with me.

30:07.022 --> 30:09.114
You're Bobby Caldwell's kid?

30:10.662 --> 30:13.591
-From Chicago?
-Yeah.

30:14.679 --> 30:17.147
-You like it there?
-Yeah.

30:17.356 --> 30:21.373
That's wonderful .
Get in the goddamn house.

30:31.038 --> 30:34.008
The 3000 block of
Las Vegas Boulevard...

30:34.385 --> 30:37.774
...also known as the
Bellagio, Mirage and MGM Grand .

30:38.025 --> 30:42.209
They' re three of the most
profitable casinos in Las Vegas.

30:44.886 --> 30:47.397
This is the Bellagio vault, located...

30:47.607 --> 30:50.367
...beneath 200 feet of solid earth.

30:50.577 --> 30:55.681
It safeguards every dime that passes
through each of the three casinos.

30:55.891 --> 30:58.987
-We're gonna rob it.
-Smash-and-grab job?

30:59.196 --> 31:01.665
Slightly more complicated than that.

31:02.417 --> 31:03.966
Well, yeah.

31:04.677 --> 31:09.781
This is courtesy of Frank Catton,
a new dealer at the Bellagio.

31:10.116 --> 31:11.497
Bad news first.

31:11.706 --> 31:16.057
This place houses a security system
rivaling most nuclear silos.

31:16.225 --> 31:21.329
First, we have to get in the casino
cages, which takes more than a smile.

31:21.538 --> 31:24.049
Next, through these doors...

31:24.258 --> 31:28.693
...each one requiring a different
code changed every 1 2 hours.

31:28.943 --> 31:32.667
Past those, the elevator.
Here's where it gets tricky.

31:32.877 --> 31:37.521
-It won't move without fingerprint l.D.
-Which we can't fake.

31:37.730 --> 31:42.709
And vocal confirmation from the system
within the Bellagio and the vault.

31:42.918 --> 31:44.508
Which we won't get.

31:44.717 --> 31:47.729
The elevator shaft is rigged
with sensors.

31:47.939 --> 31:52.750
If we override the lift, the exit
would lock and we'd be trapped .

31:53.002 --> 31:56.433
Once we get down the shaft,
it's a piece of cake.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.947
Just two more guards with Uzis...

32:00.282 --> 32:03.963
...and the most elaborate vault
door ever conceived .

32:04.633 --> 32:06.306
Any questions?

32:09.151 --> 32:10.951
Tunneling's out. There are...

32:11.160 --> 32:16.055
...sensors monitoring the ground .
If a groundhog nested, they'd know.

32:16.599 --> 32:19.862
-Anyone else?
-You mentioned good news?

32:20.072 --> 32:23.126
Yeah. The Nevada Gaming
Commission requires...

32:23.335 --> 32:28.314
...a casino to keep enough cash to
cover every chip in play on the floor.

32:28.523 --> 32:31.996
That means on a weekday
it must carry...

32:32.205 --> 32:35.301
...between $60 and $70 million in
cash and coin.

32:35.469 --> 32:39.443
On the weekend, between 80 and 90
million. On a fight night...

32:39.653 --> 32:42.749
...like in two weeks,
the night we're robbing it...

32:42.958 --> 32:46.347
...$1 50 million,
without breaking a sweat.

32:47.184 --> 32:50.572
There are 1 1 of us,
each with an equal share.

32:51.075 --> 32:52.414
You do the math.

32:52.958 --> 32:54.087
Exactly.

32:54.296 --> 32:55.677
I have a question.

32:56.221 --> 33:00.321
Say we get into the cage
and through the security doors...

33:00.530 --> 33:02.915
...down the elevator
we can't move...

33:03.125 --> 33:07.267
...past the guards with the guns,
into the vault we can't open--

33:07.810 --> 33:12.079
-And not seen by cameras.
-Sorry, I forgot to mention that.

33:12.413 --> 33:15.007
Yeah, well, say we do all that...

33:15.216 --> 33:19.860
...we're just supposed to walk out of
there with $1 50 million...

33:20.070 --> 33:22.664
...without getting stopped?

33:27.642 --> 33:28.982
Yeah.

33:31.241 --> 33:34.546
Oh. Okay.

33:41.743 --> 33:45.550
First task: reconnaissance.
I want to know what goes on...

33:45.759 --> 33:48.687
...in all casinos, from
the dealers' rotation...

33:48.855 --> 33:54.880
...to the path of cash carts. I want
to know everything about every guard.

33:55.089 --> 33:56.554
This girl Charmaine...

33:56.763 --> 34:01.323
Find out where they're from,
nicknames, how they take their coffee.

34:01.575 --> 34:04.754
...dances at Crazy Horse Too.
It pays for her school .

34:04.963 --> 34:08.184
-I think she really likes me.
-Cool .

34:13.581 --> 34:17.306
Know these casinos.
They were built to keep people in.

34:17.514 --> 34:19.313
Know the quick routes out.

34:19.523 --> 34:23.121
-He went through at 10:44.
-10:46. Get a watch that works.

34:23.331 --> 34:26.844
-You make me sick, dude. It's 10:44.
-10:46.

34:31.699 --> 34:33.540
Second task: power.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.598
On fight night, we 'll throw
the switch on Sin City.

34:37.806 --> 34:41.614
-Basher, it's your show.
-You want broke, blind or bedlam?

34:41.824 --> 34:45.213
-How about all three?
-Right, it's done.

34:46.594 --> 34:48.435
Third task: surveillance.

34:48.643 --> 34:51.614
Security has an eye
and an ear on everything.

34:51.822 --> 34:54.752
We want an eye and ear on them.
Livingston?

34:54.960 --> 34:58.100
It's not the least accessible
system I've seen.

34:58.266 --> 35:01.824
-There's no closed-circuit to tap into?
-No.

35:02.032 --> 35:07.011
Then it's definitely a black bag job.
They employ an in-house technician?

35:07.471 --> 35:10.233
Two. And one of them is lonely.

35:24.667 --> 35:27.847
Thanks, Charmaine.
I'll return it in an hour.

35:28.057 --> 35:32.366
-Say hi to your mom for me.
-Say it yourself. She's on-stage soon.

35:55.796 --> 35:56.800
Watch it, bud !

35:57.010 --> 35:59.897
-You call me bud, pal?
-You call me pal, friend?

36:00.105 --> 36:04.081
-You call me friend, jackass?
-Don't call me jackass.

36:04.289 --> 36:09.603
433, we have a visual impairment
on the northwest 052 exit-door camera.

36:10.398 --> 36:12.700
Copy that. I see them.

36:40.982 --> 36:46.087
-Is that a word? You made that up?
-" Obsequious" is a word .

36:56.757 --> 37:00.606
-Sir, please move your balloons.
-You got in my way!

37:00.815 --> 37:03.911
-I was trying to deliver balloons!
-Gentlemen!

37:04.120 --> 37:08.848
-He's a balloon boy! Balloon boy!
-You're spitting in my face.

37:27.926 --> 37:29.516
And we're up and running .

37:30.187 --> 37:35.834
-Why are hallways always that color?
-They say taupe is very soothing .

37:38.931 --> 37:41.148
-Hi .
-Fine, thanks.

37:52.779 --> 37:54.913
-Move the balloons.
-Move them?

37:55.123 --> 38:00.311
An important client is waiting for
these. I don't have time...

38:00.520 --> 38:02.904
...for you circus animals.

38:36.418 --> 38:38.845
Hey! Hold up a minute!

38:39.598 --> 38:41.271
Excuse me!

38:41.481 --> 38:44.409
Hey! Excuse me!

38:44.702 --> 38:50.141
-Hey, you dropped this.
-Oh, thank you.

38:50.351 --> 38:53.656
-How's the reception on those things?
-Excellent.

38:54.242 --> 38:57.296
-Take care.
-Thanks.

39:03.613 --> 39:06.207
-Well....
-Yeah.

39:08.383 --> 39:10.015
Fourth task: construction.

39:10.224 --> 39:14.325
We need to build an exact
replica of the Bellagio vault.

39:14.576 --> 39:17.504
-To practice?
-Something like that.

39:17.964 --> 39:21.647
Fifth task: intelligence.
We need those codes, Linus...

39:21.856 --> 39:23.906
...from the guy who has all three.

39:24.115 --> 39:27.462
-Who, Benedict?
-Learn to love his shadow.

39:27.672 --> 39:32.357
-All I get to do is watch the guy?
-Gotta walk before you crawl .

39:32.859 --> 39:36.249
-Reverse that.
-Sixth task: transport.

39:40.391 --> 39:45.579
Well, I am sorry, but $18,500 a piece
is the best offer that I can make.

39:46.541 --> 39:48.549
Well, I understand .

39:48.884 --> 39:53.695
-They are some great-looking vans.
-Yes, sir, top of the line.

39:54.742 --> 40:00.139
-Okay. Thank you for your time, Mr...?
-Denham. Billy Tim Denham.

40:01.017 --> 40:05.411
-Denham like a jean.
-That's it. Just like the jean.

40:06.582 --> 40:10.515
Man, you got some lovely hands here.
Do you moisturize?

40:10.725 --> 40:13.277
-I'm sorry?
-I've tried lots of lotion.

40:13.485 --> 40:17.586
I even went fragrance-free
for a year. Now my sister...

40:17.795 --> 40:22.146
...she uses aloe vera
with a little sunscreen in it.

40:23.444 --> 40:26.832
Ideally, we all should
wear gloves to bed...

40:27.000 --> 40:33.025
...but I found there was interference
with my social agenda, you know.

40:33.443 --> 40:38.882
Plus, I react to the camphor. So
I'm not into the traditional remedies.

40:39.092 --> 40:42.606
Let me tell you something .
If you could pay cash...

40:42.941 --> 40:45.116
...l could drop that
down to seven--

40:45.451 --> 40:47.250
Sixteen each.

40:48.212 --> 40:49.551
-No?
-Yes, sir.

40:49.760 --> 40:51.434
-You'd do that?
-Yes, sir.

40:51.768 --> 40:54.237
That'd be lovely.
They told me to see you.

40:54.698 --> 40:57.920
-Well, I'm glad they did.
-They told me.

40:58.128 --> 41:03.567
Well, let me go get the paperwork.
You just wait here at the table.

41:03.777 --> 41:05.367
-You do that.
-Thank you.

41:13.316 --> 41:17.458
-Very nice material .
-It's imported silk, Saul .

41:18.295 --> 41:19.634
It's very nice.

41:21.391 --> 41:26.244
Gentlemen, would you excuse us
for a second? Thanks.

41:34.989 --> 41:38.252
Saul, you sure you're ready
to do this?

41:41.516 --> 41:45.323
If you ever ask me
that question again, Daniel...

41:45.533 --> 41:48.378
...you won't wake up
the following morning .

41:52.687 --> 41:54.486
He's ready.

41:59.005 --> 42:01.013
My name is Lyman...

42:01.850 --> 42:02.854
...Zerga.

42:04.193 --> 42:06.829
My name is Lyman Zerga.

42:08.544 --> 42:12.017
My name is Lyman Zerga.

42:34.777 --> 42:37.205
Okay, tell me about Benedict.

42:37.413 --> 42:38.836
That guy's a machine.

42:39.046 --> 42:40.343
Good afternoon.

42:40.551 --> 42:44.234
He arrives at the Bellagio
every day at 2 p.m.

42:44.527 --> 42:45.990
How are you, Tommy?

42:46.242 --> 42:48.208
He remembers every valet's name.

42:49.087 --> 42:51.849
Not bad for a guy worth
3/4 ofa billion.

42:52.057 --> 42:55.739
He works hard, hits the
lobby floor at 7 on the nose.

42:55.949 --> 42:58.082
-Good evening, sir.
-How are you?

42:58.292 --> 43:01.471
-Talks with his casino manager.
-About what?

43:01.680 --> 43:02.685
All business.

43:03.061 --> 43:06.618
Benedict likes to know
what's going on. Be in control.

43:06.827 --> 43:11.932
There 's rarely an incident he doesn 't
know about or handle personally.

43:13.354 --> 43:17.078
Spends a few minutes
glad-handing the high rollers.

43:18.751 --> 43:23.688
He speaks Spanish, German and ltalian
and is getting good at Japanese.

43:25.697 --> 43:29.127
He 's out by 7:30
and is handed a black portfolio.

43:29.462 --> 43:34.608
Contents: profits and new security
codes. He heads to the restaurant.

43:40.633 --> 43:42.767
Like I said, a machine.

43:43.143 --> 43:46.574
That portfolio contains
codes to all the cage doors?

43:46.784 --> 43:50.465
And two minutes after they' re changed,
he's got them.

43:51.805 --> 43:56.783
You guys really can pick them.
This guy's as smart as he is ruthless.

43:56.992 --> 44:01.386
Last guy he caught cheating,
he not only sent up for 10 years...

44:01.594 --> 44:04.398
...he seized his house and
bankrupted his--

44:04.649 --> 44:06.156
In-law's dealership.

44:06.406 --> 44:10.967
He takes out your knees and ruins
your life and anybody you know.

44:11.176 --> 44:12.599
You scared?

44:12.933 --> 44:14.565
You suicidal?

44:16.490 --> 44:17.996
Only in the morning .

44:18.414 --> 44:20.673
-Now what?
-Now comes the girl .

44:21.761 --> 44:24.899
She comes down after him
if they' re in a snit.

44:25.108 --> 44:29.669
-Where does she come from?
-The museum, there. She's the curator.

44:31.510 --> 44:33.016
Here she is.

44:34.522 --> 44:37.325
This is the best part of my day.

44:50.882 --> 44:55.317
I'm not sure we can use her yet.
I haven't even caught her name.

44:55.525 --> 44:57.325
Tess.

44:57.618 --> 44:59.501
Huh?

44:59.709 --> 45:01.384
Her name is Tess.

45:24.395 --> 45:26.738
-We have to talk. Now.
-Okay.

45:31.256 --> 45:34.897
Tell me this is not about her
or I walk off the job.

45:35.232 --> 45:36.695
Who?

45:37.030 --> 45:39.834
Tess. Benedict.
Tell me this isn't about...

45:40.043 --> 45:43.097
-...the guy who's screwing your wife.
-Ex-wife.

45:43.306 --> 45:45.734
-Tell me.
-It's not about that.

45:48.411 --> 45:53.264
It's not entirely about that.
Remember when we got in this business?

45:53.474 --> 45:56.737
We said we'd play
like we had nothing to lose.

45:56.946 --> 45:58.745
Well, I lost something .

45:59.582 --> 46:03.599
I lost someone.
That's why I'm here.

46:08.536 --> 46:11.757
The problem is,
now we're stealing two things.

46:11.967 --> 46:16.234
And if you can't have both,
which do you choose?

46:16.443 --> 46:19.289
Remember, Tess does not split 1 1 ways.

46:19.623 --> 46:25.229
If everything goes to plan, I won't be
the one that has to make that choice.

46:29.957 --> 46:32.426
-How'd she look?
-She looked good .

46:32.636 --> 46:33.974
Thanks.

47:05.521 --> 47:06.818
You like it?

47:08.910 --> 47:11.462
I like that you like it.

47:14.600 --> 47:16.651
-I'll see you tonight?
-Okay.

47:24.056 --> 47:27.445
In my hotel, there's always
somebody watching .

47:28.909 --> 47:30.458
I'll see you tonight.

47:45.060 --> 47:47.193
Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga?

47:48.030 --> 47:51.879
I don't believe in weakness.
It costs too much.

47:52.297 --> 47:54.766
I don't believe in questions either.

47:54.976 --> 47:58.239
Oh, really? Well then,
let me give you a tip.

47:58.574 --> 48:02.130
Don't get into Terry Benedict
for too much money.

48:02.423 --> 48:04.264
He doesn't fool around .

48:04.472 --> 48:06.440
-How are you, Eddie?
-Fine, sir.

48:06.648 --> 48:07.987
Anything for me?

48:08.197 --> 48:12.632
Mr. Lyman Zerga. Third position.
Wants to talk to you privately.

48:14.681 --> 48:16.021
Who is he?

48:16.230 --> 48:19.158
Businessman of some kind,
from Europe.

48:19.326 --> 48:23.719
Very vague. I asked around .
Word is, he deals primarily in arms.

48:24.096 --> 48:25.979
-One of the biggest.
-Zerga.

48:26.188 --> 48:27.861
Yes, sir.

48:28.280 --> 48:31.877
-Never heard of him.
-That's why I don't doubt it.

48:32.087 --> 48:35.936
-He's staying here?
-He's in the Mirador suite.

48:36.271 --> 48:39.911
-How's he doing?
-Up, almost 200.

48:41.417 --> 48:43.383
Good for him.

48:58.112 --> 49:02.755
You're 30 seconds late.
I was about to send out a search....

49:04.178 --> 49:05.768
Hello, Tess.

49:07.315 --> 49:08.905
What are you doing here?

49:10.202 --> 49:11.458
I'm out.

49:12.044 --> 49:13.382
-Out?
-Of prison.

49:13.550 --> 49:16.897
Remember? I went for cigarettes
and didn't come back.

49:17.106 --> 49:19.951
I don't smoke. Don't sit.

49:20.496 --> 49:25.767
-Supposedly I paid my debt to society.
-Funny, I never got a check.

49:26.353 --> 49:28.445
You're not wearing your ring .

49:29.323 --> 49:33.340
I sold it. I don't have a husband
or didn't you get the papers?

49:33.550 --> 49:37.189
-My last day inside.
-I told you I'd write.

49:40.327 --> 49:45.306
-Danny, go now before--
-What? Benedict?

49:46.519 --> 49:49.491
How you doing? Whiskey and whiskey.

49:50.954 --> 49:55.515
You're doing a great job at the museum.
The Vermeer is quite good .

49:55.724 --> 49:59.783
-Vibrant. But his work fell off later.
-Remind you of anyone?

49:59.991 --> 50:04.971
I always confuse Monet and Manet.
Which one married his mistress?

50:05.347 --> 50:07.565
-Monet.
-And Manet had syphilis.

50:08.109 --> 50:10.493
They also painted occasionally.

50:14.342 --> 50:16.811
All right, I'll make this quick.

50:17.021 --> 50:18.862
I came here for you.

50:20.619 --> 50:24.133
I want to get on with my life.
I want you with me.

50:24.761 --> 50:26.602
You're a thief and a liar.

50:27.229 --> 50:30.451
I lied about being a thief.
I don't do that now.

50:30.661 --> 50:32.459
-Steal?
-Lie.

50:32.669 --> 50:35.722
I'm with someone who
doesn't have to make...

50:35.932 --> 50:39.070
-...that kind of distinction.
-He's clear on both.

50:39.572 --> 50:41.664
-You have a problem.
-Only one?

50:41.915 --> 50:47.145
You've met too many people like you.
I'm with Terry now.

50:50.073 --> 50:52.542
Does he make you laugh?

50:54.174 --> 50:57.145
He doesn't make me cry.

51:09.403 --> 51:14.425
-The fight is Saturday night?
-Yes, would you like tickets?

51:14.633 --> 51:18.399
No. Hand-to-hand combat
does not interest me.

51:18.608 --> 51:22.081
I have a package arriving
here that evening .

51:22.667 --> 51:25.177
A black briefcase, standard size...

51:25.762 --> 51:29.946
...the contents of which
is very valuable to me.

51:30.993 --> 51:33.084
I'll put it in the house safe.

51:33.294 --> 51:37.353
The house safe is for brandy
and grandmother's pearls.

51:38.440 --> 51:43.042
-I need something more secure.
-Mr. Zerga, I can assure you our--

51:43.252 --> 51:48.146
I can assure you, Mr. Benedict,
that your generosity in this matter...

51:48.314 --> 51:51.201
...will not go overlooked .

51:51.411 --> 51:57.268
Now, what can you offer me
besides the safe?

51:57.979 --> 52:02.624
People you steal from have insurance.
They get made whole again.

52:02.917 --> 52:07.728
I left New York to escape what
happened. Can I get five years back?

52:07.937 --> 52:12.121
-What you can do is not throw--
-You don't know anything .

52:12.330 --> 52:16.054
You don't love me,
you're with someone else, fine.

52:16.263 --> 52:19.192
I have to live with that.
But not him.

52:20.028 --> 52:21.744
Just like an ex-husband .

52:21.911 --> 52:24.338
-I'm not joking .
-I'm not laughing .

52:24.548 --> 52:27.476
There's a conflict of interest
when you...

52:27.685 --> 52:32.832
-...give me advice about my love life.
-But that doesn't mean I'm wrong .

52:35.258 --> 52:38.228
Do you remember what I said
when we first met?

52:39.024 --> 52:43.626
-That I better know what I'm doing .
-Do you? Now?

52:44.505 --> 52:46.178
You should go if you don't.

52:46.597 --> 52:48.144
I know what I'm doing .

52:48.354 --> 52:49.692
What are you doing?

52:51.367 --> 52:53.040
Just catching up.

52:53.375 --> 52:55.717
-Meet my ex-husband .
-Danny Ocean.

52:55.927 --> 52:58.521
-Mr. Ocean.
-I'm in your seat.

52:59.190 --> 53:02.663
Forgive my lateness.
A guest required my attention.

53:02.873 --> 53:07.182
That's fine. Danny was walking
through and spotted me.

53:07.391 --> 53:09.441
-Is that so?
-Imagine the odds.

53:09.650 --> 53:12.537
" Of all the gin joints
in all the world."

53:12.704 --> 53:15.341
You recently were
released from prison?

53:15.549 --> 53:16.554
That's right.

53:16.763 --> 53:19.859
-How does it feel to be out?
-About the same.

53:21.073 --> 53:25.716
-Danny was just about to--
-I just stopped by to say hi to Tess.

53:25.926 --> 53:27.139
Stay, have a drink.

53:27.390 --> 53:29.064
-I can't.
-He can't.

53:33.122 --> 53:35.089
Well, then....

53:36.176 --> 53:39.356
I imagine we won't see
Mr. Ocean anytime soon.

53:39.566 --> 53:41.030
You never know.

53:41.197 --> 53:44.251
I know everything
happening in my hotels.

53:44.586 --> 53:47.222
So I should put
those towels back.

53:47.431 --> 53:49.900
No, the towels you can keep.

53:55.172 --> 53:57.891
-Good to see you, Tess.
-Take care, Danny.

53:58.101 --> 54:00.277
-Terry.
-Danny.

55:26.088 --> 55:27.260
Stinking....

55:27.470 --> 55:28.976
Tomorrow the day is yours.

55:30.650 --> 55:33.662
Call is at 5:30, makeup and costume.

55:33.871 --> 55:37.679
Saul's package arrives at 7:05.
Linus grabs our codes.

55:38.013 --> 55:42.992
All goes well, we're a go. At 7:30,
Yen is locked in and we're committed .

55:43.327 --> 55:48.515
From this point, we have 30 minutes
to blow the power or he suffocates.

56:02.364 --> 56:06.046
Once the electricity goes,
access to the vault...

56:06.297 --> 56:11.024
...and its elevator shut down for
two minutes. That's when we go.

56:15.041 --> 56:19.142
You're in the middle of the
room, 10 feet from everything .

56:19.393 --> 56:23.199
You have to get to the door
without touching the floor.

56:23.702 --> 56:25.040
What do you do?

56:25.543 --> 56:28.555
-Ten says he shorts it.
-Twenty.

56:36.296 --> 56:38.221
Window or aisle, boys?

56:39.559 --> 56:41.735
Yeah, we're in deep shit.

56:42.070 --> 56:45.751
That poxy demo crew
didn't back the main line.

56:46.086 --> 56:49.141
They naused up the mainframe.
Naused it up!

56:49.852 --> 56:52.487
-You understand him?
-I'll explain later.

56:52.864 --> 56:57.090
They' re so pony they blew the
backup grids one by one.

56:57.299 --> 56:58.847
Basher, what happened?

56:59.433 --> 57:02.738
They did what I would have done
but by accident.

57:02.906 --> 57:06.503
Now they know their weakness,
they're fixing it.

57:07.215 --> 57:11.691
So unless we intend to do this job
in Reno, we're in Barney.

57:13.825 --> 57:16.085
Barney Rubble. Trouble!

57:19.934 --> 57:22.528
-We could always--
-By tomorrow?

57:23.448 --> 57:27.131
Hang on a minute, hang on.
We could use a pinch.

57:29.473 --> 57:31.733
What's a pinch?

57:32.277 --> 57:36.795
A device which creates a cardiac
arrest for broadband circuitry.

57:37.005 --> 57:40.561
Better yet, a pinch is a
bomb without the bomb.

57:40.771 --> 57:44.913
When a nuclear weapon detonates,
its electromagnetic pulse...

57:45.121 --> 57:48.343
...shuts down any power source
within its blast radius.

57:48.552 --> 57:53.489
It usually doesn't matter because a
nuclear weapon destroys everything .

57:53.825 --> 57:57.255
A pinch creates a similar
electromagnetic pulse...

57:57.464 --> 58:01.899
...without mass destruction and death.
Instead of Hiroshima you get...

58:02.066 --> 58:04.535
-...the 1 7th century.
-How long?

58:04.745 --> 58:05.832
30 seconds.

58:06.418 --> 58:10.978
Could a pinch knock out
the power of an entire city?

58:11.188 --> 58:14.158
-Like, for instance--
-Las Vegas?

58:16.417 --> 58:18.217
Yeah, I think it might.

58:18.593 --> 58:21.815
There's only one pinch
big enough to do it.

58:22.024 --> 58:23.153
Where?

58:36.375 --> 58:38.676
Let's go. Yen, Basher, come on.

58:39.179 --> 58:40.517
Where you going?

58:40.852 --> 58:42.483
-I'm coming with you.
-No.

58:42.693 --> 58:46.040
Oh, no, no, no!
Don't leave me with these guys!

58:55.196 --> 58:56.158
Start.

58:56.367 --> 58:58.584
-I got one.
-You thinking of one?

58:58.919 --> 59:02.267
-No, I've thought of one.
-You're thinking of one.

59:02.433 --> 59:04.526
No, I'm done. I have it.

59:04.735 --> 59:06.241
-You a man?
-Yes. 1 9.

59:06.450 --> 59:07.873
-You alive?
-Yes. 18.

59:08.040 --> 59:10.509
-Evel Knievel .
-Shit!

59:10.760 --> 59:12.434
-Don't touch me.
-I'm not.

59:12.642 --> 59:15.237
-Your hand's in my face.
-It's not.

59:15.446 --> 59:18.374
-Am I touching you?
-Your hand's in my face.

59:18.584 --> 59:20.383
-Move.
-I didn't touch you.

59:20.550 --> 59:23.646
-You just touched me.
-You made me touch you.

59:23.856 --> 59:26.533
This is your side.
This is your side.

59:27.830 --> 59:29.880
Get off. Get off.

59:57.913 --> 01:00:00.716
I'm gonna need a score of
car batteries--

01:00:00.926 --> 01:00:04.231
Where's Linus? Where's Linus?

01:00:12.724 --> 01:00:16.197
-There he is.
-Oh, would you look at this doughnut?

01:00:28.163 --> 01:00:29.836
Should someone help him?

01:00:30.046 --> 01:00:34.146
That's a great idea, Albert.
Let's all get nicked .

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:40.673
Back it up.

01:00:57.827 --> 01:00:59.292
Let him in.

01:01:06.822 --> 01:01:09.166
You stupid bastard !

01:01:14.772 --> 01:01:16.906
-I say stay, you stay.
-Got it.

01:01:17.116 --> 01:01:20.337
Lose focus for one second,
somebody gets hurt!

01:01:20.546 --> 01:01:21.969
I got it.

01:01:26.319 --> 01:01:28.035
Where are they?

01:01:28.788 --> 01:01:32.261
That's what I want to know.
Where the hell are they?

01:01:32.471 --> 01:01:36.278
-They will be here.
-"They will be here." Schmuck!

01:01:43.935 --> 01:01:45.901
You boys have a nice trip?

01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:58.536
We have a problem.

01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:01.465
You've been red-flagged .

01:02:01.674 --> 01:02:05.523
The moment you enter the casino,
they'll be watching .

01:02:05.733 --> 01:02:09.833
Like hawks. Hawks with video cameras.

01:02:11.632 --> 01:02:13.473
That's a problem.

01:02:13.682 --> 01:02:16.444
-Saul, turn that off.
-When I'm ready--

01:02:16.653 --> 01:02:20.042
-Saul !
-It's off! It's off!

01:02:22.553 --> 01:02:24.727
Any idea how this happened?

01:02:26.317 --> 01:02:27.657
-No.
-Oh, come on.

01:02:27.824 --> 01:02:32.720
He's been chasing Benedict's girl .
They had an argument two nights ago.

01:02:33.932 --> 01:02:36.025
-I tailed you.
-Who told you to?

01:02:36.234 --> 01:02:39.330
I did. I worried you couldn't
leave Tess alone.

01:02:39.539 --> 01:02:40.794
-Tess?
-My wife.

01:02:41.003 --> 01:02:43.472
-Ex-wife.
-Tess is here?

01:02:44.895 --> 01:02:49.245
I'm sorry. I didn't know if it
would sting you, but it did.

01:02:49.413 --> 01:02:51.463
-You're out, Danny.
-He's out?

01:02:51.673 --> 01:02:55.312
Or we call it off.
His involvement puts us at risk.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:59.706
-It's not your call.
-You put her before us and made it mine.

01:02:59.915 --> 01:03:01.714
This is my job.

01:03:02.174 --> 01:03:03.220
Not anymore.

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:06.861
He can't just be out.
Who's gonna trigger the vault?

01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:08.869
Kid, you up for it?

01:03:14.642 --> 01:03:16.023
I can do it.

01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:20.040
Done. Locate the others.
Tell them the change in plan.

01:03:20.248 --> 01:03:21.923
Curtain goes up at 7.

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:27.111
Tess is with Benedict now?
She's too tall for him.

01:03:28.533 --> 01:03:30.876
Yes. No.

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.056
Very much no.

01:03:36.315 --> 01:03:42.131
Then inform Mr. Levin he'll be better
off watching the fight at home on TV.

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:46.190
Surely, he must have HBO.
That's it.

01:03:50.791 --> 01:03:51.963
Hi .

01:03:54.850 --> 01:03:56.816
What were you thinking about?

01:03:58.030 --> 01:03:59.285
You.

01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:04.724
Where you gonna put your hands?

01:04:07.402 --> 01:04:08.866
No good .

01:04:10.623 --> 01:04:13.092
Don't touch your tie. Look at me.

01:04:13.302 --> 01:04:16.774
You need to answer my question.
Where do you look?

01:04:16.983 --> 01:04:22.004
No. Look down, they know you're lying .
Up, and you don't know the truth.

01:04:22.213 --> 01:04:24.974
Don't use seven words if four will do.

01:04:25.184 --> 01:04:30.623
Be specific, but not memorable.
Be funny, but don't make him laugh.

01:04:30.832 --> 01:04:34.640
He's got to like you,
then forget you once you leave.

01:04:34.848 --> 01:04:37.945
And, for God's sake,
whatever you do, don't--

01:04:38.154 --> 01:04:40.414
Russ! Can you take a look at this?

01:04:40.622 --> 01:04:42.045
Sure.

01:04:58.614 --> 01:05:00.078
Saul?

01:05:05.266 --> 01:05:06.730
It's time.

01:05:25.182 --> 01:05:26.688
Okay.

01:05:26.981 --> 01:05:28.403
Let's do it.

01:05:31.751 --> 01:05:34.596
On a perfectly clear night
in Las Vegas...

01:05:34.804 --> 01:05:38.863
... with the expected crowd of
celebrities and sports fans...

01:05:39.073 --> 01:05:44.051
...piling into the MGM Grand, the two
best heavyweights in the world...

01:05:44.261 --> 01:05:50.201
...prepare to meet after an
eight-month dance toward each other.

01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:54.093
Mr. Zerga?

01:05:54.553 --> 01:05:56.268
Mr. Benedict.

01:05:56.477 --> 01:06:01.708
-I'm very busy. Are we on schedule?
-I have no reason to suspect otherwise.

01:06:02.251 --> 01:06:06.100
My courier should be here momentarily.

01:06:26.769 --> 01:06:30.367
Eighteen. Blackjack!

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:48.191
Find Mr. Walsh. Tell him Mr. Ocean
is in the west slots.

01:06:49.949 --> 01:06:54.341
I can't have private security personnel
in the casino cages.

01:06:54.551 --> 01:06:55.931
Of course not.

01:06:57.438 --> 01:07:00.408
Saul! Saul Bloom, is that you?

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:03.922
Saul! Saul, it's me! Bucky Buchanan!

01:07:04.132 --> 01:07:06.475
Remember? From Saratoga!

01:07:10.533 --> 01:07:12.040
Mikael. Vladimir.

01:07:12.291 --> 01:07:15.889
Hey! Hey, Saul! Saul !

01:07:17.939 --> 01:07:19.445
Mr. Benedict, please.

01:07:19.655 --> 01:07:23.964
I have never enjoyed the touch
of steel to my skin.

01:07:31.202 --> 01:07:33.043
Lift them up, please.

01:07:41.453 --> 01:07:46.264
I acknowledge your briefcase contains
nothing dangerous or illicit.

01:07:46.474 --> 01:07:50.365
I agree to take said briefcase
and store it in my vault...

01:07:50.574 --> 01:07:52.540
...for a period of 24 hours.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.431
-I cannot allow you into the vault.
-Why not?

01:07:56.641 --> 01:08:02.163
Insurance, for one. Security. But,
most of all, I just don't trust you.

01:08:03.502 --> 01:08:04.841
Excuse me.

01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:13.460
I put two plainclothes on Ocean.
He's in the keno bar now.

01:08:13.669 --> 01:08:17.518
Mr. Zerga, this is my
casino manager, Mr. Walsh.

01:08:17.728 --> 01:08:22.162
He will have your briefcase stored
in our vault while you watch.

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:24.799
Those are my terms. Yes or no?

01:08:25.551 --> 01:08:28.941
You leave me no choice.

01:08:32.455 --> 01:08:35.216
Dude, don't do that in
front of the pinch.

01:09:19.902 --> 01:09:23.122
Deep breaths. You 'll do fine.

01:09:23.332 --> 01:09:25.926
-Thank you.
-No sweat. You 're a natural.

01:09:26.135 --> 01:09:28.353
But don 't screw up.

01:09:35.508 --> 01:09:38.435
-Who gets the penne?
-Right here.

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:45.674
You ready?

01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:52.453
This is our security center,
where we oversee the casino and vault.

01:09:52.661 --> 01:09:55.423
You'll monitor your briefcase
from here.

01:09:55.591 --> 01:09:57.180
Don't let me keep you.

01:09:57.389 --> 01:10:00.151
-Mr. Zerga.
-Mr. Benedict.

01:10:06.218 --> 01:10:07.891
Linus, you're up.

01:10:09.230 --> 01:10:10.402
Got him.

01:10:10.778 --> 01:10:12.243
Mr. Benedict.

01:10:13.079 --> 01:10:16.008
Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

01:10:16.217 --> 01:10:18.686
I need two minutes of your time.

01:10:19.941 --> 01:10:21.907
-Anything for the NGC.
-Thanks.

01:10:22.159 --> 01:10:25.004
Will you accompany me
to pit five, please?

01:10:43.915 --> 01:10:46.844
-You make the deposit when?
-At your signal .

01:10:47.053 --> 01:10:51.069
What do we look like,
a couple of peckerwood jackasses?

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:54.710
How does that feel?
You all right?

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:57.680
Want something to read?
A magazine?

01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:59.856
All right. Counting down.

01:11:00.232 --> 01:11:03.537
Thirty minutes of
breathing time starts now.

01:11:04.208 --> 01:11:06.885
This just came to our attention today.

01:11:07.094 --> 01:11:10.190
Apparently, he's got
a record longer than my....

01:11:11.152 --> 01:11:12.700
It's long .

01:11:16.549 --> 01:11:18.893
If he is who you say he is.

01:11:24.081 --> 01:11:26.340
You been at the commission long?

01:11:26.926 --> 01:11:30.984
-About 18 months.
-You know Hal Lindley? Worked with him?

01:11:32.993 --> 01:11:35.419
Not since he died last year.

01:11:39.436 --> 01:11:43.871
Ramon Escalante? Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

01:11:44.081 --> 01:11:45.754
What's going on here?

01:11:45.962 --> 01:11:50.524
-It's come to our attention--
-We should speak off the floor.

01:11:51.151 --> 01:11:52.407
Charlie.

01:12:14.707 --> 01:12:16.129
Thank you.

01:12:18.179 --> 01:12:21.443
-No. I want you out of here.
-Give me one moment.

01:12:21.736 --> 01:12:25.251
-I've had it. I want you gone.
-Tess, come here.

01:12:25.459 --> 01:12:27.217
You're up to something .

01:12:27.384 --> 01:12:31.526
Don't say you're here for me.
You're pulling a job, aren't you?

01:12:31.735 --> 01:12:35.125
Well, no matter what it is,
you won't win me back.

01:12:35.292 --> 01:12:37.969
Tess, I just came to say goodbye.

01:12:45.166 --> 01:12:46.504
Goodbye.

01:13:00.855 --> 01:13:02.487
You be good .

01:13:13.198 --> 01:13:16.210
-Mr. Ocean.
-Mr. Benedict wishes to see you.

01:13:16.713 --> 01:13:18.428
I thought he might.

01:13:20.101 --> 01:13:24.871
Good afternoon, Mr. Escalante.
Or should I call you Mr. Catton?

01:13:26.252 --> 01:13:29.976
You're Frank Catton, of
the Tropicana, the Desert lnn...

01:13:30.185 --> 01:13:34.452
...and the New York State
Penitentiary system. Are you not?

01:13:36.628 --> 01:13:40.310
I take it from your silence
you won't refute that.

01:13:40.812 --> 01:13:44.787
Mr. Benedict, you're employing
an ex-convict. As you know--

01:13:44.996 --> 01:13:46.209
Goddamn cracker.

01:13:49.306 --> 01:13:51.858
-Excuse me?
-You heard me.

01:13:52.068 --> 01:13:54.996
Black man can't earn a decent wage?

01:13:55.205 --> 01:13:58.636
-You wanna throw me on the street.
-I'm doing my job.

01:13:59.012 --> 01:14:01.690
Want me to get on the table and dance?

01:14:01.899 --> 01:14:04.326
Shine your shoes? Smile at you?

01:14:04.536 --> 01:14:10.058
You sure won't let me deal the cards.
You might as well call it whitejack!

01:14:12.527 --> 01:14:17.548
I don't know what to say to that.
Race has nothing to do with it.

01:14:17.756 --> 01:14:21.271
-Yeah, right.
-What a horrible thing to say!

01:14:22.777 --> 01:14:28.676
You, of all people, know the NGC has
always supported hiring colored--

01:14:29.221 --> 01:14:32.945
-No! I didn't mean it!
-Okay. Come on, sit down.

01:14:33.865 --> 01:14:36.083
-Sit down.
-You better talk to him.

01:14:36.752 --> 01:14:39.136
-He's got it.
-Sit down.

01:14:39.346 --> 01:14:42.107
Virgil. Turk. Deliver the package.

01:14:54.283 --> 01:14:56.291
-Where's your card?
-I lost it.

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.299
-You serious?
-I'm so stupid.

01:14:58.508 --> 01:15:01.227
-You are so stupid! You know that?
-Hey!

01:15:01.479 --> 01:15:05.244
You think it helps to call someone
names who's upset?

01:15:05.454 --> 01:15:09.219
-Hey! IKeep it down.
-Sorry. Sorry.

01:15:09.387 --> 01:15:13.069
-Where did this come from?
-High roller's room.

01:15:13.277 --> 01:15:16.834
-It's Mr. Benedict's stuff.
-Joe, take this inside.

01:15:17.043 --> 01:15:20.767
-Count room?
-No, to the vault.

01:15:20.976 --> 01:15:23.445
Benedict's money goes in the vault.

01:15:23.654 --> 01:15:28.214
Next time, remember the card,
and we won't run into this again.

01:15:28.424 --> 01:15:30.474
-Stupid.
-Jeez!

01:15:37.336 --> 01:15:39.344
Yo! Hold that, please.

01:15:41.059 --> 01:15:46.080
-There's your briefcase now, Mr. Zerga.
-Wonderful .

01:15:52.063 --> 01:15:53.695
That's my cue.

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:56.707
Give Basher the go.

01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:59.343
Bash, what's your status?

01:15:59.552 --> 01:16:03.066
-Bash!
-Easy. No need to shout, guv' ner.

01:16:03.276 --> 01:16:06.246
-What's your status?
-I'm nearly there.

01:16:24.405 --> 01:16:26.036
Come on, come on.

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:31.099
Mr. Walsh, show this man
off the premises.

01:16:31.475 --> 01:16:34.321
Don't ever set foot
in my casino again.

01:16:34.530 --> 01:16:35.827
Sir?

01:16:37.082 --> 01:16:39.174
-Cracker!
-Oh, dear God !

01:16:47.458 --> 01:16:52.019
Oh! I forgot my pager.
I left it. Sorry.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.156
-Know the way back?
-I do.

01:16:55.366 --> 01:16:56.496
Good .

01:16:57.039 --> 01:16:58.964
Okay. Enjoy the fight.

01:17:00.094 --> 01:17:01.726
Sorry!

01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:10.889
How much longer you figure
Mr. Benedict's gonna be?

01:17:20.595 --> 01:17:23.482
No cameras in this room, huh?

01:17:24.947 --> 01:17:26.369
Yeah.

01:17:27.875 --> 01:17:31.097
Don't want anybody seeing
what goes on in here.

01:17:33.817 --> 01:17:35.992
He's not coming, is he?

01:17:46.578 --> 01:17:50.469
We're gonna step outside.
Leave you two to talk things over.

01:17:53.230 --> 01:17:57.456
I hadn't seen my wife in three weeks,
so I decided to call her.

01:17:57.665 --> 01:18:01.598
"I love you, you love me."
"I miss you, you miss me."

01:18:01.765 --> 01:18:05.113
That went well, but then
I went to this party....

01:18:09.338 --> 01:18:12.643
I show up at 1 p.m.
She expected me at 1 1 a.m...

01:18:12.811 --> 01:18:16.702
...so she was going crazy.
I said, "What do you expect?

01:18:16.912 --> 01:18:20.593
What do you think goes on?
It's not choir practice."

01:18:20.928 --> 01:18:22.559
Oh, shit.

01:18:25.781 --> 01:18:28.083
Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga?

01:18:28.291 --> 01:18:31.890
I am very satisfied .

01:18:34.526 --> 01:18:39.504
-Are you all right, sir?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:18:41.513 --> 01:18:42.935
All right.

01:18:47.538 --> 01:18:49.044
Jesus!

01:18:50.467 --> 01:18:51.930
Bruiser!

01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:56.575
-Not until later!
-Sorry, Danny. I forgot.

01:18:56.785 --> 01:18:58.333
It's all right.

01:19:00.048 --> 01:19:02.935
-How's your wife?
-Pregnant again.

01:19:03.186 --> 01:19:07.495
Well, it happens.
Let's get started. Come here.

01:19:36.532 --> 01:19:39.963
-You're almost there, Linus.
-Who's that guy?

01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:43.435
-I got a bogey in west corridor.
-Mr. Zerga!

01:19:47.451 --> 01:19:51.217
-Call a doctor! Mr. Zerga!
-Put this under his head .

01:19:51.427 --> 01:19:54.439
Going to video now.

01:19:54.648 --> 01:19:56.949
--to the Eye in the Sky ASAP.

01:19:57.159 --> 01:19:59.753
We have a man down
who's unconscious.

01:20:11.007 --> 01:20:12.597
Oh, Jesus!

01:20:13.811 --> 01:20:18.288
-Did you really think I'd sit this out?
-You didn't trust me?

01:20:18.497 --> 01:20:19.961
I do now.

01:20:20.673 --> 01:20:22.137
Come on.

01:20:51.843 --> 01:20:53.977
Someone call for a doctor?

01:21:03.014 --> 01:21:06.947
-How'd you get here?
-Had to give a friend two million.

01:21:07.198 --> 01:21:11.967
But what about Rusty? The argument?
I mean, what was that about?

01:21:13.599 --> 01:21:18.034
Come on. Why not just tell me?
Why put me through all this?

01:21:18.244 --> 01:21:21.507
Where's the fun in that?
Let's get going .

01:21:22.218 --> 01:21:25.105
Come on, man! Breathe!

01:21:25.482 --> 01:21:27.908
Breathe, damn it! Breathe!

01:21:33.725 --> 01:21:37.741
I'm sorry. We've lost him.

01:21:39.289 --> 01:21:42.929
-Dude, I told you to hurry.
-Don't do that. Just don't.

01:21:43.138 --> 01:21:45.063
I didn't tell you to hurry?

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.787
Come on, get up! Get up!

01:21:54.141 --> 01:21:55.983
Had enough yet?

01:22:21.673 --> 01:22:25.773
-These things are gonna hold us, right?
-They should.

01:22:41.629 --> 01:22:43.554
Livingston, we're set.

01:22:44.266 --> 01:22:47.236
-Livingston, we're set.
-Basher, we're set.

01:22:48.115 --> 01:22:50.333
Hang on a minute, chief.

01:22:50.541 --> 01:22:53.303
We don 't have one.
Yen 's gonna suffocate.

01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:56.483
Then you should
leave off bothering me, okay?

01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:56.397
All right, crack them.

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:07.945
Go.

01:24:14.556 --> 01:24:16.061
Shit!

01:24:16.982 --> 01:24:18.320
Cut it.

01:24:43.258 --> 01:24:44.596
Hey!

01:24:46.563 --> 01:24:49.491
Pit six, table five.
Dealers compromised .

01:24:49.701 --> 01:24:53.257
Trade's breached at tables three,
five, six and ten.

01:25:04.846 --> 01:25:07.608
Get your coat. Get your coat.

01:25:08.236 --> 01:25:10.495
Look, this is crazy! What...?

01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:54.593
Not yet. Not yet.

01:25:59.949 --> 01:26:01.456
Go ahead .

01:26:03.589 --> 01:26:07.606
-You think Yen made it out okay?
-I'm sure he'll be fine.

01:26:08.986 --> 01:26:10.451
How we doing?

01:26:11.455 --> 01:26:14.258
Okay, I guess.

01:26:31.035 --> 01:26:35.847
There's a 95-pound Chinese man
with $1 60 million behind this door.

01:26:36.056 --> 01:26:38.274
-Let's get him out.
-Yeah.

01:26:48.901 --> 01:26:51.203
-10 says he shorts it.
-No bet.

01:26:51.411 --> 01:26:53.127
Try him again.

01:27:24.758 --> 01:27:26.264
Okay.

01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:35.761
Hey. Where we at, boys?

01:27:35.971 --> 01:27:40.030
-Pins and floor sensors, now.
-Blinding .

01:27:46.681 --> 01:27:48.356
Here we go.

01:27:56.807 --> 01:27:59.986
Counting down from 20. Now.

01:28:00.196 --> 01:28:01.576
Twenty...

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:08.522
-Don't blow the door. Can you read me?
-Ten...

01:28:08.815 --> 01:28:10.740
...nine, eight...

01:28:10.906 --> 01:28:15.133
-Maybe the pinch blew out his earwigs.
-Do not blow the door!

01:28:17.266 --> 01:28:20.069
...two, one.

01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:29.484
What's wrong?

01:28:29.692 --> 01:28:31.199
Something....

01:28:43.877 --> 01:28:46.344
Did you check the batteries?

01:28:48.395 --> 01:28:51.868
You know, lose focus
in this game for one second--

01:28:52.076 --> 01:28:56.303
I know, somebody gets hurt.
You don't hear Yen complaining .

01:29:16.929 --> 01:29:18.394
Yen?

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:28.519
Where the fuck you been?

01:29:31.155 --> 01:29:32.953
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

01:29:42.995 --> 01:29:47.431
That is the sexiest thing
I've ever seen.

01:29:50.736 --> 01:29:52.074
Rusty, you're up.

01:30:03.538 --> 01:30:07.221
-You gonna answer that?
-I don't have a cell phone.

01:30:11.321 --> 01:30:12.994
This isn't mine.

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:16.384
See who it is.

01:30:18.392 --> 01:30:21.362
-Hello?
-May I have a word with Mr. Benedict?

01:30:21.572 --> 01:30:23.078
It's for you.

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:31.320
-Who the hell is this?
-The man who 's robbing you.

01:30:36.299 --> 01:30:41.613
-What's going on in the vault?
-Nothing, sir. It's all normal .

01:30:41.821 --> 01:30:43.328
Show me.

01:30:45.294 --> 01:30:48.432
-You're mistaken.
-Watching your monitors?

01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:50.985
Okay, keep watching.

01:31:00.734 --> 01:31:03.787
In this town,
luck can change that quickly.

01:31:03.997 --> 01:31:07.428
-Find out how much money's down there.
-Yes, sir.

01:31:24.373 --> 01:31:25.753
Tess?

01:31:26.423 --> 01:31:27.971
Tess?

01:31:28.891 --> 01:31:30.648
Perhaps you should....

01:31:31.024 --> 01:31:32.907
Perhaps I should what?

01:31:33.786 --> 01:31:37.719
It would be better if you weren't
around here for this.

01:31:45.627 --> 01:31:48.347
All right, you proved your point.

01:31:48.555 --> 01:31:53.660
You broke into my vault.
Congratulations. You're a dead man.

01:31:53.869 --> 01:31:58.681
-Maybe.
-Maybe? May I ask how you will leave?

01:31:59.057 --> 01:32:02.865
You think I'll let you
take my money out my casino doors?

01:32:03.074 --> 01:32:07.175
-No. You'll carry it out for us.
-Why would I do that?

01:32:07.383 --> 01:32:09.057
Look at your monitor.

01:32:10.772 --> 01:32:15.417
As your manager's probably reporting,
you have over $ 160 million...

01:32:15.626 --> 01:32:19.726
...in your vault tonight.
We 're only packing up half that.

01:32:19.936 --> 01:32:24.161
The other half we 're leaving,
booby-trapped, as a hostage.

01:32:24.496 --> 01:32:28.680
You let our $80 million go,
and you get to keep yours.

01:32:28.889 --> 01:32:32.529
You try and stop us,
we'll blow both cashloads.

01:32:36.295 --> 01:32:42.278
You can lose $80 million secretly
or lose $1 60 million publicly.

01:32:42.486 --> 01:32:43.784
Your decision. Hi .

01:32:55.164 --> 01:32:56.754
Make the call.

01:33:02.110 --> 01:33:03.909
91 1 emergency response.

01:33:05.415 --> 01:33:08.301
-Where's Danny?
-He's fine. He's in good form.

01:33:08.511 --> 01:33:12.318
-He asks that you go up and watch TV.
-He does?

01:33:12.778 --> 01:33:17.548
We have three men with explosives
who have taken control of our vault.

01:33:20.351 --> 01:33:22.486
-Okay.
-It's alright, Tess.

01:33:22.737 --> 01:33:24.661
-You have a deal.
-I promise.

01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:27.339
Fantastic. Here's what you do:

01:33:28.804 --> 01:33:32.653
The guys in the vault will put
six bags in the elevator.

01:33:32.861 --> 01:33:34.744
It will rise to your cages.

01:33:34.954 --> 01:33:39.138
Three of your guards will carry
the bags out into the casino.

01:33:39.556 --> 01:33:45.079
If they take more than 20 seconds to
reach the floor, or there's a switch...

01:33:45.288 --> 01:33:47.882
...we'll blow all the money.

01:33:49.639 --> 01:33:52.986
-He's in the casino by the slots.
-Of course I am.

01:33:53.196 --> 01:33:58.676
I'm staying in your hotel.
I have two words for you: mini bar.

01:34:00.727 --> 01:34:03.028
Once the guards
hit the casino floor...

01:34:03.238 --> 01:34:08.634
...a white van will pull up outside.
Your guards will load the rear.

01:34:08.843 --> 01:34:14.116
If anyone so much as approaches the
driver's door, we 'll blow everything.

01:34:15.538 --> 01:34:20.308
When I hear the van is away and
the money secure, my men will leave.

01:34:20.517 --> 01:34:24.115
Once their safety is confirmed,
you 'll get your vault.

01:34:24.701 --> 01:34:26.626
The S.W.A.T. team is here.

01:34:28.215 --> 01:34:29.805
All right.

01:34:30.014 --> 01:34:35.203
Now, I have complied with your
every request. Would you agree?

01:34:35.411 --> 01:34:36.751
I would.

01:34:37.211 --> 01:34:40.098
Good. Because now
I have one of my own:

01:34:40.893 --> 01:34:44.700
Run and hide, asshole. Run and hide.

01:34:44.909 --> 01:34:49.930
If you're picked up buying a $100,000
sports car in Newport Beach...

01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:55.453
...l'll be disappointed. I want my
people to find you, and when they do...

01:34:55.662 --> 01:34:59.428
...rest assured, we won't
hand you over to the police.

01:34:59.636 --> 01:35:04.448
So, my advice to you again
is this: run and hide.

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:07.503
That is all that I ask.

01:35:29.928 --> 01:35:34.490
Mr. Benedict, our guys say that
van is headed for McCarran Airport.

01:35:34.698 --> 01:35:38.296
I want my vault
back before that van hits the tarmac.

01:35:48.673 --> 01:35:51.308
Night goggles on.
Prepare to cut power.

01:35:54.823 --> 01:35:56.078
Ready.

01:35:58.882 --> 01:36:00.723
Cutting power now.

01:36:03.065 --> 01:36:04.237
Do it.

01:36:06.036 --> 01:36:08.379
Breaching elevator doors now.

01:36:09.007 --> 01:36:12.437
We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.

01:36:13.023 --> 01:36:14.236
Wait a minute.

01:36:14.446 --> 01:36:16.329
Guys! Guys!
Someone 's here!

01:36:16.537 --> 01:36:19.006
-Take him down, now!
-I got him!

01:36:20.764 --> 01:36:23.901
-Lights! We need power now!
-Give it to him.

01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:37.374
What's going on?
Talk to me.

01:36:37.583 --> 01:36:41.767
It appears an explosive incendiary
device has been detonated.

01:36:41.976 --> 01:36:45.700
Continuing search for survivors.

01:36:45.909 --> 01:36:48.754
Tell them to take the van.
I'll be there.

01:36:48.963 --> 01:36:52.060
And find out how they
hooked into my system!

01:36:52.268 --> 01:36:53.817
Yes, sir.

01:37:12.143 --> 01:37:15.490
Get out of the van, now. Now!

01:37:20.008 --> 01:37:21.766
Tires. Tires.

01:37:38.627 --> 01:37:40.760
Our search yielded no suspects.

01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:45.070
Nor can we determine how they
entered or exited the premises.

01:37:47.748 --> 01:37:50.551
-Take your men out.
-May I suggest you--?

01:37:50.761 --> 01:37:52.266
Now.

01:37:52.559 --> 01:37:55.656
It's your vault.
Blue team, move it out!

01:38:04.233 --> 01:38:06.534
Walsh, where are we with the van?

01:38:24.817 --> 01:38:27.747
I just want to try
something for a second .

01:38:29.001 --> 01:38:31.387
There's nobody inside.

01:38:33.018 --> 01:38:37.997
-I'm sorry. Did you want to get in?
-Enough monkey business.

01:38:38.206 --> 01:38:39.838
Do it already.

01:38:55.194 --> 01:38:58.415
Mr. Benedict.
We took the van, sir.

01:38:58.624 --> 01:38:59.628
And?

01:38:59.837 --> 01:39:03.185
They say there was no
money in the bags, sir.

01:39:03.352 --> 01:39:04.942
What do you mean?

01:39:05.193 --> 01:39:09.879
They say the bags were filled
with fliers, sir. For hookers.

01:39:16.196 --> 01:39:17.326
Walsh?

01:39:17.871 --> 01:39:20.338
Cue up the tape to the robbery.

01:39:22.096 --> 01:39:24.607
Yes, sir. I'm looking at the tape now.

01:39:25.443 --> 01:39:28.957
Does it say "Bellagio "
on the vault floor?

01:39:29.167 --> 01:39:31.761
No, it doesn't.
I don't understand .

01:39:34.146 --> 01:39:36.112
We had it installed Tuesday.

01:39:36.321 --> 01:39:39.920
The images we saw of those
men robbing us was a tape.

01:39:40.255 --> 01:39:41.510
What?

01:39:43.559 --> 01:39:47.409
It was staged .
Somebody made a duplicate of my vault.

01:39:47.618 --> 01:39:51.760
What we saw on the monitor
wasn't actually happening .

01:39:52.806 --> 01:39:56.697
I don 't understand.
What happened to all that money?

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:08.580
Make the call.

01:40:16.194 --> 01:40:18.203
91 1 emergency response.

01:40:21.968 --> 01:40:24.102
-Night goggles on.
-Clear.

01:40:24.311 --> 01:40:25.775
Prepare to cut power.

01:40:30.922 --> 01:40:33.432
Breaching elevator doors now.

01:40:33.851 --> 01:40:37.072
We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.

01:40:37.281 --> 01:40:38.411
Wait a minute.

01:40:38.621 --> 01:40:40.419
Guys! Guys!
Someone's here!

01:40:40.712 --> 01:40:43.474
-Take him down, now!
-I got him!

01:41:32.175 --> 01:41:33.305
Open the door.

01:41:39.623 --> 01:41:43.597
Hey, Benedict.
How's the other fight going?

01:41:49.287 --> 01:41:50.417
Pick him up.

01:41:59.664 --> 01:42:01.588
Did you have a hand in this?

01:42:02.802 --> 01:42:05.186
Did I have my hand in what?

01:42:09.788 --> 01:42:11.839
I'll ask you one more time.

01:42:12.048 --> 01:42:14.349
Did you have your hand in this?

01:42:17.236 --> 01:42:21.252
Benedict, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:42:25.646 --> 01:42:27.111
Okay.

01:42:28.366 --> 01:42:30.164
You're free to go.

01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:34.055
Show him out.

01:42:40.708 --> 01:42:43.344
-Hello.
-Turn to channel 88.

01:42:43.553 --> 01:42:45.311
Who is this?

01:42:54.348 --> 01:42:57.068
What happened, Benedict?
You get robbed?

01:42:57.276 --> 01:42:58.783
Stop.

01:43:09.786 --> 01:43:12.213
I'll give you one last chance.

01:43:13.343 --> 01:43:14.556
Where 's my money?

01:43:14.765 --> 01:43:17.736
What ifl said you could
get your money back...

01:43:18.824 --> 01:43:20.832
...if you 'd give up Tess?

01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:23.384
What would you say?

01:43:26.397 --> 01:43:27.568
I would say yes.

01:43:32.631 --> 01:43:33.928
All right.

01:43:35.936 --> 01:43:38.907
I know a guy.
We were in the joint together.

01:43:39.116 --> 01:43:43.467
Anybody pulls anyjob in the
Western U. S., he knows about it.

01:43:44.012 --> 01:43:48.028
Give me 72 hours, I'll find
out who took your money.

01:43:52.421 --> 01:43:54.471
You know a guy.

01:43:57.191 --> 01:44:02.127
Contact the police. I'm sure he's
in violation of his parole.

01:44:02.295 --> 01:44:03.802
Yes, sir.

01:44:29.658 --> 01:44:31.164
Tess.

01:44:33.089 --> 01:44:34.595
Tess.

01:44:35.264 --> 01:44:37.775
You of all people should know, Terry.

01:44:37.984 --> 01:44:41.833
In your hotel,
there's always someone watching .

01:46:22.290 --> 01:46:23.839
Wait!

01:46:24.675 --> 01:46:26.013
Wait!

01:46:27.478 --> 01:46:30.448
Wait, that's my husband !

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:37.311
-Danny.
-Tess, I told you...

01:46:38.524 --> 01:46:40.532
...l knew what I was doing .

01:46:41.411 --> 01:46:42.959
I didn't.

01:46:43.168 --> 01:46:44.926
All right, let's go.

01:46:46.139 --> 01:46:47.938
How long will you be?

01:46:48.147 --> 01:46:50.658
About three to six months, I guess.

01:49:46.216 --> 01:49:48.141
I hope you were the groom.

01:49:51.362 --> 01:49:55.086
Ted Nugent called,
he wants his shirt back.

01:50:02.743 --> 01:50:07.135
Thirteen million and you drive
this piece of shit to pick me up?

01:50:07.345 --> 01:50:09.186
I blew it all on the suit.

01:50:09.395 --> 01:50:13.579
-Where are they?
-Back row, silver sedan. Ten o'clock.

01:50:13.788 --> 01:50:17.553
I picked up your personal
effects. Hope you don't mind .

01:50:20.064 --> 01:50:22.533
I'm not sure these belong to me.

01:50:33.494 --> 01:50:34.959
-Hi .
-Hi .

01:50:35.168 --> 01:50:36.506
Rusty needs a girl .

01:50:36.716 --> 01:50:39.561
There's a women's
prison down the road .

01:50:41.151 --> 01:50:43.159
You said that you sold this.

01:50:43.369 --> 01:50:45.042

01:50:45.293 --> 01:50:46.758
Liar.

01:50:48.473 --> 01:50:49.895
Thief.
