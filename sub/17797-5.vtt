<i>Previously on The Affair...</i>

00:08.077 --> 00:09.444
You don't remember me, do you?

00:09.446 --> 00:11.579
John Gunther. We've actually met.

00:11.581 --> 00:14.949
It was high school. Swim meets.

00:14.951 --> 00:17.652
And your marriage to the ex-convict

00:17.654 --> 00:19.354
who killed your brother-in-law.

00:19.356 --> 00:20.355
How's that going?

00:20.357 --> 00:21.389
We're estranged.

00:21.391 --> 00:22.823
But not divorced.

00:22.825 --> 00:24.458
Well, the problem is, you seem incapable

00:24.460 --> 00:26.627
of putting that child's
needs before your own.

00:26.629 --> 00:27.794
Don't be a monster.

00:27.796 --> 00:29.663
She is my child,

00:29.665 --> 00:31.030
and she needs me.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.966
Mr. Solloway, we're treating this attack

00:32.968 --> 00:34.234
as an attempted homicide.

00:34.236 --> 00:36.202
Cole is definitely a person of interest.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.904
What about Alison Bailey?

00:37.906 --> 00:40.839
Someone tried to fucking
kill me, and you got nothing.

00:40.841 --> 00:44.477
I promise you, I am
punishing myself already.

00:44.479 --> 00:45.711
Alison.

00:51.719 --> 00:56.555
You know, what you got
there is an inmate violation.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.922
I'm gonna hang onto this for a sec.

00:57.924 --> 00:59.691
- Come on.
- Hey!

01:01.094 --> 01:02.694
Fuck.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.861
I'm gonna keep this nice and safe.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.866
Detective Stanton, I think
I know who attacked me.

01:08.868 --> 01:11.169
You can have Joanie on
Tuesday for her birthday.

02:36.485 --> 02:37.950
Alison?

02:51.031 --> 02:53.465
Can't believe I'm actually looking at you.

02:57.036 --> 02:58.536
What are you doing here?

03:02.475 --> 03:04.609
I came to see you.

03:04.611 --> 03:06.444
Thought I'd surprise you.

03:06.446 --> 03:08.946
No, I... I-I can't.

03:08.948 --> 03:13.350
If... if Cole finds you out here, he'll...

03:13.352 --> 03:14.984
He'll what?

03:14.986 --> 03:16.486
I'm sorry, I have to go. I can't...

03:16.488 --> 03:18.822
Alison.

03:18.824 --> 03:22.358
I got stabbed four days ago.

03:23.695 --> 03:25.695
I know.

03:25.697 --> 03:27.798
Sorry.

03:27.800 --> 03:32.468
But I... I don't know what to
do. I can't be seen with you.

03:32.470 --> 03:35.304
Well, then it's lucky I ran
into you on this deserted road,

03:35.306 --> 03:38.507
'cause I was about to start
asking in town where you live.

03:48.819 --> 03:50.351
Okay.

03:50.353 --> 03:53.488
66 South Emden Road.

03:55.158 --> 03:58.259
Meet me in 15 minutes.
Do not follow me home.

03:58.261 --> 04:01.629
<i>And do not park that in my driveway.</i>

04:04.067 --> 04:06.166
- You don't like it?
- No.

04:06.168 --> 04:08.435
You got out of prison
and you bought a red car?

04:08.437 --> 04:10.737
No.

04:10.739 --> 04:13.206
It's not mine. It's a friend's.

04:33.027 --> 04:34.794
So, what's she like now?

04:37.532 --> 04:38.730
She's good.

04:38.732 --> 04:41.700
She's... intense.

04:41.702 --> 04:44.135
Wonder where she gets that from.

04:48.041 --> 04:51.075
You look awful.

04:51.077 --> 04:53.211
Do I?

04:55.581 --> 04:57.381
Because I feel great.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.721
So, what happened?

05:03.723 --> 05:06.323
Someone stabbed me.

05:06.325 --> 05:08.225
Well, who?

05:08.227 --> 05:11.662
I'm not sure. I never saw anyone.

05:11.664 --> 05:13.462
Are you serious?

05:14.633 --> 05:17.600
Do the police have any leads?

05:17.602 --> 05:19.536
Not that I know of.

05:22.306 --> 05:23.472
Jesus, Noah.

05:23.474 --> 05:25.808
I'm so sorry.

05:25.810 --> 05:27.744
Thank you.

05:38.488 --> 05:39.688
Are you sure you're okay?

05:39.690 --> 05:41.256
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:46.463 --> 05:48.195
I'm glad you're here.

05:48.197 --> 05:51.465
And I... I want to
talk about everything.

05:51.467 --> 05:53.467
But you have to know

05:53.469 --> 05:55.937
I'm in such a precarious position.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.472
Joanie's lawyer basically told me

05:58.474 --> 06:01.375
that if I have anything to do with you,

06:01.377 --> 06:03.477
it will ruin my case.

06:03.479 --> 06:06.813
And I'm so close to regaining custody,

06:06.815 --> 06:10.684
so... I just...

06:30.738 --> 06:32.537
What are those?

06:35.375 --> 06:37.842
Just muscle relaxers.

06:47.220 --> 06:50.254
Looks like Vicodin to me.

06:56.061 --> 06:58.829
Is your neck hurting that much?

06:58.831 --> 07:01.264
Yes.

07:01.266 --> 07:04.001
You have to be careful
with that stuff, Noah.

07:04.003 --> 07:05.168
It's addictive.

07:05.170 --> 07:07.104
I know.

07:20.118 --> 07:23.119
You have to leave in the morning.

07:26.590 --> 07:27.957
I get it.

07:29.693 --> 07:31.459
I'm sorry.

07:39.402 --> 07:42.737
It's nice to see me just a
little bit, though, right?

07:46.575 --> 07:48.408
Night.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.055
Hey.

08:04.492 --> 08:08.260
So, I... I have an idea.

08:08.262 --> 08:11.764
Why don't we go to
Block Island for the day?

08:11.766 --> 08:13.666
- What?
- Well, you can't be seen

08:13.668 --> 08:16.936
with me here, so let's go somewhere else.

08:16.938 --> 08:20.205
No. What... are you insane?

08:20.207 --> 08:23.842
That's the million-dollar question.

08:23.844 --> 08:26.344
No, I... I'm not having eggs with you.

08:26.346 --> 08:28.046
I'm not taking a stroll with you.

08:28.048 --> 08:32.116
I'm... not going anywhere with you.

08:32.119 --> 08:34.318
In fact, I...

08:34.321 --> 08:36.321
Can you look at this, please?

08:36.323 --> 08:37.922
What is it?

08:52.238 --> 08:54.503
- Divorce?
- I need you to sign those.

08:54.505 --> 08:56.339
It's no-contest.

08:56.341 --> 08:58.341
I told my lawyer that I
don't want anything from you.

08:58.343 --> 09:00.009
I just want a clean slate.

09:04.850 --> 09:09.185
That's a pretty big thing
to drop on me, isn't it?

09:11.021 --> 09:12.955
What, you... you won't sign them?

09:15.559 --> 09:19.161
I just don't think I'm
ready to give up on us yet.

09:30.673 --> 09:31.906
- My God.
- What?

09:31.908 --> 09:33.241
- You have to hide.
- Why?

09:33.243 --> 09:35.076
- Quick, it's Cole.
- Fuck that.

09:35.078 --> 09:36.543
- No, please, go in the back.
- I'm not hiding from him.

09:36.545 --> 09:37.845
- Get out the back.
- You're my wife.

09:37.847 --> 09:40.248
Please? Just... go.

09:45.254 --> 09:47.687
Fuck.

09:58.566 --> 10:00.566
Fuck. Shit.

10:00.568 --> 10:02.401
Go!

10:19.585 --> 10:21.519
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.390
Can I come in?

10:26.392 --> 10:29.060
Yeah. Yeah, come in.

10:36.435 --> 10:37.801
You okay?

10:37.803 --> 10:39.903
Yeah, I think so. Are you?

10:39.905 --> 10:41.972
No. Not really.

10:41.974 --> 10:45.008
No. No, no, no, no. Me neither, I'm...

10:45.010 --> 10:47.410
- What were we thinking?
- Yeah, right, I know.

10:47.412 --> 10:48.745
We can not do this. It's insane.

10:48.747 --> 10:50.948
No. No, I know, um...

10:50.950 --> 10:52.949
We had our chance and we screwed it up,

10:52.951 --> 10:55.584
and I am married to somebody else.

10:55.586 --> 10:56.853
- I know.
- And I love Luisa.

10:56.855 --> 10:58.620
She is a good woman.

10:58.622 --> 11:00.622
- Okay.
- I am not gonna hurt her

11:00.624 --> 11:02.558
the way that you hurt me.

11:03.995 --> 11:05.661
- And what about you?
- Right.

11:05.663 --> 11:07.596
You've come so far putting
your life back together.

11:07.598 --> 11:11.466
I do not want something
like this to derail you.

11:11.468 --> 11:12.834
Derail me?

11:12.836 --> 11:15.603
Yeah, I-I don't want to derail the prog...

11:15.605 --> 11:18.106
What, you think I'm gonna freak out again?

11:18.108 --> 11:20.275
That's... no. I-I just...

11:20.277 --> 11:21.676
I know how much work that you've put in

11:21.678 --> 11:24.179
to try to regain some
order to your thoughts.

11:24.181 --> 11:25.613
What, do you think I'm crazy, Cole?

11:25.615 --> 11:27.114
No. That's not what I'm saying.

11:27.116 --> 11:29.383
- Well?
- What I'm trying to say is

11:29.385 --> 11:33.187
that... I'm not going to leave Luisa.

11:33.189 --> 11:34.989
I never asked you to, so...

11:34.991 --> 11:36.623
But... but...

11:36.625 --> 11:38.125
I want what you want.

11:38.127 --> 11:41.128
I want you to have joint
custody without any hiccups.

11:41.130 --> 11:43.530
I want our lives to go back to normal.

11:43.532 --> 11:47.733
It's what's best for Joanie.

11:47.735 --> 11:51.905
Well, you could just give
me shared custody back.

11:51.907 --> 11:53.239
No. That's not how it works.

11:53.241 --> 11:54.908
Well, it could be, though.

11:54.910 --> 11:56.910
You could just say to the
judge at our next hearing

11:56.912 --> 11:58.844
that you trust me,

11:58.846 --> 12:00.546
and you think I'm emotionally sound enough

12:00.548 --> 12:02.147
to take care of Joanie.

12:05.085 --> 12:07.019
If that's what you believe.

12:12.326 --> 12:14.393
Right.

12:14.395 --> 12:16.561
So, I'm healthy enough to fuck,

12:16.563 --> 12:18.062
but not to be the mother of our child.

12:18.064 --> 12:19.663
There's a process in
place for a reason, Alison.

12:19.665 --> 12:22.033
No, I understand. Thanks for coming by.

12:23.336 --> 12:24.735
I'm sorry.

12:24.737 --> 12:26.537
- No, don't apologize.
- I am sorry.

12:26.539 --> 12:28.272
I'm just trying to do what's
best for everyone here.

12:28.274 --> 12:29.706
Yeah. I know you are.

12:32.845 --> 12:35.011
I care about you.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.548
We're not kids anymore. We can't...

12:38.550 --> 12:40.016
Cole, I get it.

12:40.018 --> 12:41.351
The other night never happened, okay?

12:41.353 --> 12:43.219
Please just go.

12:46.624 --> 12:48.591
Fuck.

12:48.593 --> 12:51.027
Hey, Luisa told me that
you're gonna take Joanie

12:51.029 --> 12:52.561
for her birthday tomorrow.

12:54.265 --> 12:55.864
Yeah.

12:57.701 --> 12:59.601
So come by the Lobster Roll at 3:00.

12:59.603 --> 13:01.370
I'll bring her there after school.

13:08.779 --> 13:10.711
Thank you.

13:18.621 --> 13:22.156
Look, can you please just
sign the papers and go?

13:25.895 --> 13:27.160
Come to Block Island with me.

13:27.162 --> 13:29.463
No. I'm not going anywhere.

13:29.465 --> 13:30.663
Just drop it.

13:30.665 --> 13:32.732
If you come, I'll sign the papers.

13:35.804 --> 13:38.271
I'm serious. Come on.

13:38.273 --> 13:40.240
Just one day.

13:40.242 --> 13:41.608
By the end of it, if
you still want a divorce,

13:41.610 --> 13:42.609
then I'll sign the papers.

13:42.611 --> 13:44.110
You never have to see me again.

13:44.112 --> 13:46.845
What do you think is
gonna happen in one day?

13:46.847 --> 13:48.280
I don't know. Anything can happen.

13:48.282 --> 13:50.349
I'm not gonna sleep with you, Noah.

13:50.351 --> 13:52.985
Please. Come on, gross.

13:56.424 --> 13:58.357
Come on.

13:58.359 --> 14:01.826
Come on, you missed me just a little bit.

14:01.828 --> 14:03.094
Just one day.

14:03.096 --> 14:05.430
Just one more day together.

14:05.432 --> 14:08.433
At the end of it, you
can get back on your knees

14:08.435 --> 14:11.036
and flagellate yourself in
front of Cole and Luisa...

14:11.038 --> 14:12.103
God.

14:12.105 --> 14:13.604
For the rest of eternity,

14:13.606 --> 14:15.540
if that's what you really want.

14:21.047 --> 14:23.347
If you touch me,

14:23.349 --> 14:25.482
<i>I'll yell rape, okay?</i>

14:25.484 --> 14:27.184
Okay. But technically,

14:27.186 --> 14:28.485
you're still my wife,
so that's not really...

14:28.487 --> 14:30.554
- No.
- Cause...!

14:52.409 --> 14:55.009
Why didn't you answer any of my letters?

14:57.881 --> 15:01.149
I didn't get any while I was away.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.417
Sorry.

15:02.419 --> 15:04.086
Where? In the loony bin?

15:04.088 --> 15:05.653
No.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.155
The rehabilitation institution.

15:10.393 --> 15:12.359
How did that go?

15:12.361 --> 15:13.994
Fine.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.162
How was prison?

15:17.433 --> 15:19.500
- Whoo-hoo!
- Noah!

15:19.502 --> 15:22.035
- Block Island!
- No, what are you doing?

15:22.037 --> 15:23.404
- Please.
- It's called being happy.

15:23.406 --> 15:24.405
- Why don't you try it?
- No. What? Get...

15:24.407 --> 15:26.072
- Yahoo!
- Noah.

15:26.074 --> 15:29.075
- Block Island! We love you!
- My God, no. Stop. Please.

15:29.077 --> 15:31.144
- Please don't.
- Block Island, baby!

15:52.366 --> 15:53.798
Noah?

15:53.800 --> 15:56.235
What?

15:56.237 --> 15:59.203
Get the fuck off me.

15:59.205 --> 16:01.772
Please.

16:01.774 --> 16:04.108
Whoo-hoo!

16:05.945 --> 16:07.778
Block Island, baby!

16:07.780 --> 16:09.614
My God.

16:12.051 --> 16:14.485
This is nice.

16:14.487 --> 16:16.886
Aren't you glad we came?

16:16.888 --> 16:18.087
I'm hungry.

16:18.089 --> 16:19.789
Me too. God, what a coincidence.

16:19.791 --> 16:21.491
What are the chances
of us both being hungry

16:21.493 --> 16:23.393
at the exact same time?

16:23.395 --> 16:25.728
Noah, did someone stab you in the brain?

16:25.730 --> 16:28.765
That's not nice.

16:28.767 --> 16:31.901
No. That's a bar.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.503
Well, they might have
oyster crackers or something.

16:50.187 --> 16:51.486
They got wings.

16:51.488 --> 16:54.755
Teriyaki or Jamaican jerk.

16:54.757 --> 16:56.524
Jerk.

17:14.776 --> 17:16.676
So, what's your plan?

17:16.679 --> 17:19.045
What do you mean?

17:19.047 --> 17:20.780
I mean are you gonna hang out in Montauk

17:20.781 --> 17:22.382
for the rest of your life

17:22.384 --> 17:26.785
hoping that Cole will stop
being such a giant dick?

17:26.787 --> 17:29.222
Don't talk about him like that.

17:29.224 --> 17:30.756
Okay, but...

17:34.229 --> 17:35.461
he's an asshole.

17:35.463 --> 17:37.129
I'm serious. Stop.

17:37.131 --> 17:38.631
I mean, who takes a child
away from their own mother?

17:38.633 --> 17:41.066
Look, he didn't take her...

17:41.068 --> 17:42.133
Nevermind.

17:42.135 --> 17:43.368
Come on. Say it.

17:43.370 --> 17:44.802
No, there's no point talking to you.

17:44.804 --> 17:46.170
Why not?

17:46.172 --> 17:48.306
Because you never really hear me.

17:58.317 --> 18:02.219
Cole is doing his best in
an impossible situation.

18:02.221 --> 18:04.388
And I'm grateful for...

18:04.390 --> 18:05.756
You're grateful?

18:05.758 --> 18:07.491
Yes.

18:07.493 --> 18:11.328
Look, we made a schedule
in Joanie's best interest,

18:11.330 --> 18:15.165
and eventually I'll get shared custody

18:15.167 --> 18:16.699
when I'm ready.

18:22.039 --> 18:26.041
Look, Cole will only ever
see you as a disaster, Alison.

18:29.247 --> 18:31.347
Whatever what you do,
however competent you become,

18:31.349 --> 18:33.948
you will always be damaged goods to him.

18:37.354 --> 18:38.920
If you really think he's...

18:38.922 --> 18:40.689
he's ever gonna truly
trust you with Joanie,

18:40.691 --> 18:42.924
then you're being incredibly naÃ¯ve.

18:49.132 --> 18:51.565
I'm just telling the truth.

18:54.904 --> 18:57.104
- Maybe he's right.
- No, he's not.

18:57.106 --> 19:00.608
Yeah? He's known me the longest.

19:00.610 --> 19:02.710
Maybe I can't be saved.

19:02.712 --> 19:04.645
Wow.

19:04.647 --> 19:06.413
You're really determined
to be unhappy, aren't you?

19:06.415 --> 19:08.147
No.

19:08.149 --> 19:10.617
No, I'm determined to take responsibility

19:10.619 --> 19:12.051
for my actions, Noah...

19:12.053 --> 19:14.788
something you wouldn't understand.

19:35.343 --> 19:37.108
Have you seen Helen?

19:39.613 --> 19:41.178
A little bit.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.582
Did you ever say anything about...

19:44.584 --> 19:46.250
- you know, that I was there?
- No.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.689
Why didn't you just
let me go to the police?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.624
Come on. Let's not go back there.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.360
He was attacking me.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.961
It would've been seen as self-defense.

19:57.963 --> 19:59.629
- Maybe.
- Not maybe, it's true.

19:59.631 --> 20:02.466
Says you, Alison. You had no proof.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.167
Well, we should've tried to tell the truth.

20:04.169 --> 20:06.936
Yeah, well, we didn't.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.910
It's like you wanted to go to prison.

20:27.725 --> 20:29.224
Nobody here!

20:30.561 --> 20:32.627
Noah!

20:32.629 --> 20:34.562
Come here, look what I found.

20:34.564 --> 20:35.797
What?

20:38.402 --> 20:39.634
Noah.

20:40.904 --> 20:43.004
The hot tub.

20:43.006 --> 20:44.572
Get down from there.

20:44.574 --> 20:46.207
- You want to try it?
- No! It's not ours.

20:46.209 --> 20:47.409
Come on. There's no one here.

20:47.411 --> 20:49.342
Season's over. They're gone.

20:49.344 --> 20:51.678
No. Noah, I'm leaving.

20:51.680 --> 20:52.913
Why not?

20:52.915 --> 20:54.481
You're trespassing.

20:54.483 --> 20:56.583
For God's sake, you're on parole.

20:56.585 --> 20:57.818
So I'm the one who should be worried.

20:57.820 --> 20:59.420
Not you.

20:59.422 --> 21:00.587
God.

21:02.024 --> 21:03.424
Shit.

21:06.093 --> 21:08.260
No. Don't.

21:08.262 --> 21:09.228
Jackpot.

21:09.230 --> 21:10.430
Put that back.

21:10.432 --> 21:13.533
Noah, don't... you... no.

21:13.535 --> 21:15.735
You used to be a lot more fun.

21:19.373 --> 21:22.441
Look, why would they keep it on
if they had left for the season?

21:22.443 --> 21:24.943
'Cause they're rich.

21:24.945 --> 21:27.546
Rich people don't care.

21:27.548 --> 21:30.515
These things are a pain
in the ass to heat anyway.

21:30.517 --> 21:34.285
The Butlers keep theirs on all winter, too.

21:34.287 --> 21:36.555
Come on, Alison.

21:36.557 --> 21:38.256
Can't you just relax?

21:38.258 --> 21:39.757
We're basically the only two fucking people

21:39.759 --> 21:42.192
on the whole fucking island.

21:42.194 --> 21:45.763
No, no, no, Noah, you cannot
be naked in a stranger's hot tub

21:45.765 --> 21:47.130
without permission... no... God.

21:53.873 --> 21:54.972
My God.

21:54.974 --> 21:58.140
This is so nice!

21:58.142 --> 22:00.743
God, that's good.

22:00.745 --> 22:02.912
Yes!

22:02.914 --> 22:05.114
Yes!

22:05.116 --> 22:08.250
It's so good.

22:12.423 --> 22:14.089
Okay, fine.

22:26.169 --> 22:28.169
No.

22:28.171 --> 22:29.605
Close your eyes.

22:29.607 --> 22:31.071
No, come on. I want to watch.

22:31.073 --> 22:33.608
I'm not coming in unless
you close your eyes.

22:35.812 --> 22:39.046
<i>Okay, then if I close my eyes,
it gets really dirty.</i>

22:52.093 --> 22:53.660
Fuck, can I open yet?

22:53.662 --> 22:55.896
Yes. Okay.

22:57.533 --> 22:59.966
Okay.

22:59.968 --> 23:02.002
This is nice. It is nice.

23:02.004 --> 23:04.570
You're right..

23:07.642 --> 23:09.875
Cheers.

23:17.284 --> 23:19.284
God.

23:27.293 --> 23:29.527
What if I moved to Montauk?

23:35.035 --> 23:36.400
Why?

23:37.503 --> 23:39.069
To be with you.

23:40.806 --> 23:44.641
No. I, I want a divorce, Noah.

23:44.643 --> 23:45.909
- Come on.
- Yeah.

23:45.911 --> 23:48.011
- You don't.
- Yeah.

23:48.013 --> 23:49.446
I do.

23:51.550 --> 23:53.383
Look.

23:53.385 --> 23:55.385
I know I was a jerk, but I...

23:57.655 --> 23:59.989
I just got out of three years in prison.

23:59.991 --> 24:03.392
I don't want what I used to.

24:03.394 --> 24:04.694
I just want a simple life.

24:04.696 --> 24:06.696
I just want to get back into teaching.

24:06.698 --> 24:08.965
I want to live with someone I love.

24:10.702 --> 24:14.035
Raise a... a kid that's not mine.

24:22.512 --> 24:24.679
All I thought about when I was away was

24:24.681 --> 24:26.615
all the time I wasted

24:26.617 --> 24:29.050
just chasing the wrong things,

24:29.052 --> 24:30.985
taking you for granted.

24:34.957 --> 24:36.356
You were the best thing
that ever happened to me.

24:36.358 --> 24:38.592
No. No, don't say that.

24:38.594 --> 24:40.728
- It's true.
- No, it's not.

24:40.730 --> 24:45.065
You're rewriting history.

24:45.067 --> 24:47.900
You and I were a mistake.

24:47.902 --> 24:48.901
- A mistake?
- Yeah.

24:48.903 --> 24:49.902
Come on.

24:49.904 --> 24:50.903
You know, you fell for me

24:50.905 --> 24:53.072
because you were bored

24:53.074 --> 24:56.976
and you felt trapped by Helen, your kids,

24:56.978 --> 24:59.345
your fucking father-in-law.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.214
And you wanted a fling,

25:02.216 --> 25:03.649
but you chose me,

25:03.651 --> 25:04.816
who had lost a child,

25:04.818 --> 25:07.418
and who was so incredibly sad

25:07.420 --> 25:10.522
you couldn't just abandon me,

25:10.524 --> 25:14.126
so you convinced yourself
that you loved me.

25:14.128 --> 25:16.461
And I convinced myself that I loved you,

25:16.463 --> 25:21.231
because I so desperately needed
someone just to take me away.

25:27.540 --> 25:29.874
I used you.

25:29.876 --> 25:33.544
You used me too.

25:33.546 --> 25:36.180
That's what happened between us.

25:37.616 --> 25:39.115
You... you really think that?

25:39.117 --> 25:42.052
Yeah. I know it's true.

25:42.054 --> 25:44.854
And you do too.

25:47.292 --> 25:48.958
Boys, bring your stuff inside!

25:48.960 --> 25:50.426
Fuck.

25:52.230 --> 25:55.864
Stop! Hey, get back here!

25:57.501 --> 25:58.801
I'm calling the cops!

25:58.803 --> 26:00.836
No. Shit.

26:00.838 --> 26:02.971
Fuck.

26:05.976 --> 26:09.044
You should've seen your fucking face.

26:09.046 --> 26:12.046
Hey! Hey!

26:12.048 --> 26:13.380
Fuck.

26:14.718 --> 26:16.584
- My God.
- Shh, shh, shh.

26:16.586 --> 26:19.220
God.

26:19.222 --> 26:20.521
Assholes.

26:20.523 --> 26:22.824
I'm gonna freak out.

26:22.826 --> 26:25.059
I'm fucking freezing.

26:27.263 --> 26:28.262
Fuck.

26:28.264 --> 26:29.763
Let's get you inside.

26:29.765 --> 26:31.497
No, look, I just want to go home, actually.

26:31.499 --> 26:32.565
Please.

26:36.371 --> 26:38.171
- Fuck!
- What?

26:38.173 --> 26:39.940
My fucking shoes. I left them.

26:42.544 --> 26:44.344
Careful.

26:49.016 --> 26:50.549
- No.
- Shit.

26:50.551 --> 26:52.184
- Wait! Wait!
- No!

26:52.186 --> 26:53.385
No, no, no, no.

26:53.387 --> 26:55.955
- No!
- Hey! Please!

26:57.424 --> 26:58.758
Can he come back?

26:58.760 --> 26:59.725
No.

26:59.727 --> 27:00.960
When's the next ferry?

27:00.962 --> 27:03.094
That was the last one of the day, dude.

27:05.698 --> 27:07.531
I'm really sorry.

27:12.939 --> 27:14.739
No.

27:33.558 --> 27:35.926
Thank God. Are you open?

27:35.928 --> 27:37.593
Technically, no.

27:37.595 --> 27:39.996
The season ended a few days ago, but...

27:41.833 --> 27:43.565
Ed?

27:43.567 --> 27:46.235
Can we take someone in for the night?

27:46.237 --> 27:49.071
Do you have any clothes we can borrow?

28:12.795 --> 28:15.562
I'll sign the divorce papers.

28:17.499 --> 28:20.467
As soon as we get home.

28:20.469 --> 28:22.036
Thank you.

28:25.674 --> 28:28.107
I just want to say one thing, though.

28:32.814 --> 28:35.048
I did love you.

28:38.486 --> 28:41.187
Yeah, I fucked up, and maybe...

28:41.189 --> 28:45.157
maybe it was a mistake
from the start, but...

28:45.159 --> 28:46.925
it was love.

28:48.829 --> 28:50.795
At least it was for me.

28:50.797 --> 28:52.331
So don't...

28:55.635 --> 28:57.035
don't take it all away from me

28:57.037 --> 28:58.803
by saying it wasn't real.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.913
You may not want to remember me, but...

29:12.151 --> 29:14.919
I want to remember you, okay?

29:21.726 --> 29:23.293
Okay.

29:44.848 --> 29:49.684
So, I still don't understand
how this is supposed to work.

29:49.686 --> 29:52.554
I mean, are you just gonna wait around

29:52.556 --> 29:56.958
for Cole to finally let you have
custody of your own child back?

29:56.960 --> 29:58.426
No.

29:58.428 --> 30:00.861
There's a whole court procedure.

30:00.863 --> 30:02.630
Which he can circumvent if he wants to.

30:02.632 --> 30:04.565
Right.

30:14.776 --> 30:16.709
I left her, Noah.

30:20.149 --> 30:22.916
I left her for six months. I...

30:27.455 --> 30:29.721
I'm not okay.

30:29.723 --> 30:34.393
You know, I mean, I'm
trying to be, but I...

30:36.397 --> 30:39.098
I have these moments of,

30:39.100 --> 30:42.301
like, such darkness.

30:44.637 --> 30:48.340
I don't know how I'll get past them.

30:55.949 --> 30:59.951
I just... I seem to be
making one bad decision

30:59.953 --> 31:03.587
after another.

31:09.595 --> 31:10.694
You know, maybe it's me.

31:10.696 --> 31:13.930
Maybe I'm just kidding myself

31:13.932 --> 31:18.601
if I think I could ever be a good mother.

31:23.608 --> 31:25.941
My mother...

31:27.945 --> 31:30.946
she couldn't give me everything I needed

31:30.948 --> 31:32.882
'cause she was sick.

31:35.819 --> 31:38.220
And as it got worse, she...

31:42.292 --> 31:44.359
I mean, she couldn't
help me with my homework.

31:44.361 --> 31:45.727
She couldn't teach me how to drive.

31:45.729 --> 31:47.329
She couldn't go shopping.

31:47.331 --> 31:50.899
She couldn't even...

31:50.901 --> 31:52.699
she couldn't even make a meal for me.

31:52.701 --> 31:54.868
But none of that mattered to me.

31:54.870 --> 31:57.804
I just needed to know she was there.

32:00.043 --> 32:03.544
Look, you don't have to be
the greatest mother on Earth.

32:07.083 --> 32:10.016
All you need to do for Joanie is be there.

32:12.187 --> 32:14.521
Don't ever leave her again.

32:16.724 --> 32:20.993
Stay for as long as she needs you, and...

32:20.995 --> 32:24.230
I promise you that'll be enough.

32:56.317 --> 32:59.363
_

33:12.244 --> 33:14.644
I won't have anything to do with you.

33:28.092 --> 33:30.159
Did you hear anything I just said?

33:32.497 --> 33:34.562
Yeah, you're telling me that you...

33:34.564 --> 33:37.999
I can't contact you anymore.

33:38.001 --> 33:39.167
I don't understand.

33:39.169 --> 33:40.435
How long did you leave Joanie with...

33:40.437 --> 33:41.936
Please, just don't judge me. Okay?

33:41.938 --> 33:43.571
I'm not judging you. I'm... I'm just...

33:43.573 --> 33:47.008
Well, that's why you
haven't heard from me, okay?

33:47.010 --> 33:51.778
I... I had to cut myself
off from... from everything.

33:53.682 --> 33:55.282
I had to reevaluate everything.

33:55.284 --> 33:57.684
And now that I'm back in Montauk, I'm...

33:57.686 --> 33:59.019
I'm still getting better.

33:59.021 --> 34:01.622
I'm working on myself, but I...

34:04.693 --> 34:07.827
I'm just afraid that...

34:07.829 --> 34:09.362
when you get out, you may still think

34:09.364 --> 34:11.397
you have me to come home to.

34:15.670 --> 34:18.603
And what you're trying
to tell me is I-I-I won't?

34:31.318 --> 34:33.518
What... can't we wait until I get out?

34:33.520 --> 34:34.719
It's only a few more months.

34:34.721 --> 34:36.188
No.

34:36.190 --> 34:38.121
It's been made very clear to me

34:38.123 --> 34:41.958
that if you come back into my life,

34:41.960 --> 34:44.295
I won't regain custody of Joanie.

34:55.007 --> 34:57.007
I'm sorry.

35:03.915 --> 35:07.183
She's even hotter than I
thought she'd be in real life.

35:08.019 --> 35:10.553
- What?
- Lana.

35:10.555 --> 35:12.088
She reminds me

35:12.090 --> 35:15.091
of the girls that we grew up with.

35:15.927 --> 35:16.927
You know?

35:19.263 --> 35:21.396
Hey, let it go.

35:21.398 --> 35:23.565
Not your fault.

35:23.567 --> 35:27.569
This place is like a
black hole for marriages.

35:27.571 --> 35:31.039
Goes in, don't come out.

35:31.041 --> 35:33.041
Who do you think she's fucking now?

35:33.043 --> 35:34.508
Her ex-husband?

35:34.510 --> 35:37.211
Guy that she used to work
for at that restaurant?

35:37.213 --> 35:38.379
What? Too soon?

35:39.382 --> 35:41.115
Sorry.

35:41.117 --> 35:42.617
That's what I'd be
thinking about if I was you

35:42.619 --> 35:44.218
in this place.

35:44.220 --> 35:46.621
Then again, maybe I'm
not as evolved as you are.

36:01.035 --> 36:04.704
I've been meaning to ask you...

36:04.706 --> 36:06.706
what are you here for?

36:12.045 --> 36:13.579
What did you do?

36:18.118 --> 36:20.886
I hit someone with a
car. It was an accident.

36:26.225 --> 36:27.692
You killed him?

36:29.763 --> 36:31.095
Yeah.

36:35.602 --> 36:37.702
No.

36:39.272 --> 36:43.473
People like you don't do time for that.

36:43.475 --> 36:47.010
That's weird, 'cause here you are.

36:48.514 --> 36:53.517
You must be one very
unlucky motherfucker...

36:56.154 --> 36:59.087
Or you're not telling me the whole truth.

37:01.693 --> 37:03.892
But I will find out. I always do.

37:15.806 --> 37:18.506
Hey, wait, what are you
doing? Come here! No!

37:18.508 --> 37:20.375
This is exciting. Look at this.

37:20.377 --> 37:21.876
It's not anything yet. It's just notes.

37:21.878 --> 37:23.378
Solloway.

37:23.380 --> 37:25.814
Fuck.

37:25.816 --> 37:27.281
Can I read a little bit?

37:34.457 --> 37:37.224
"Jack Hunter stood poised
on the starting block,"

37:37.226 --> 37:39.993
his head down, and his young muscles tense.

37:39.995 --> 37:42.529
The cold, hard water
from his pre-swim shower

37:42.531 --> 37:44.331
was beading on his arm hair,

37:44.333 --> 37:47.368
a thousand tiny magnifying glasses

37:47.370 --> 37:50.236
"clinging to his skin."

37:50.238 --> 37:52.505
My God.

37:52.507 --> 37:54.440
I got a hard-on.

37:59.313 --> 38:01.647
Swimming.

38:01.649 --> 38:03.649
It's beautiful, man.

38:03.651 --> 38:06.185
It's really, really beautiful.

38:06.187 --> 38:07.419
Wait,

38:07.421 --> 38:09.354
who's, who's Jack Hunter?

38:13.861 --> 38:15.994
Nobody.

38:15.996 --> 38:17.496
Just made him up.

38:22.669 --> 38:23.834
I'm gonna hang onto this, you know,

38:23.836 --> 38:25.035
just make sure that it's safe.

38:25.037 --> 38:26.103
Come on, John. It's just a story.

38:26.105 --> 38:27.705
It's Gunther!

38:31.944 --> 38:34.578
I'm gonna keep this.

38:34.580 --> 38:38.081
If anything were to happen to you,

38:38.083 --> 38:39.750
your work is safe.

38:46.224 --> 38:47.524
It's my only copy.

38:47.526 --> 38:49.225
It's my only fucking copy!

39:44.513 --> 39:46.079
Noah?

39:48.016 --> 39:49.682
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:49.684 --> 39:51.416
What are you doing out here?

39:56.023 --> 39:57.790
Nothing. I-I...

40:00.094 --> 40:02.260
thought I saw someone I knew.

40:02.262 --> 40:04.129
Someone you knew?

40:04.131 --> 40:06.063
It's 2:00 in the morning.

40:07.501 --> 40:08.867
Yeah.

40:21.147 --> 40:22.613
My dad died.

40:22.615 --> 40:24.948
Just over a week ago.

40:24.950 --> 40:27.217
He did?

40:27.219 --> 40:29.653
My God, Noah. I'm so sorry.

40:29.655 --> 40:31.522
No. It's okay.

40:31.524 --> 40:34.858
How is it okay?

40:34.860 --> 40:36.793
Well, I just meant...

40:39.297 --> 40:41.063
I don't know what I meant.

40:42.500 --> 40:45.535
Did he say good-bye?

40:45.537 --> 40:46.903
No.

40:55.980 --> 40:59.080
What do you know about your dad?

40:59.082 --> 41:01.750
I told you.

41:01.752 --> 41:03.317
Nothing.

41:03.319 --> 41:05.420
Athena must have some idea who he is.

41:05.422 --> 41:07.522
Nope. She says she doesn't.

41:09.593 --> 41:10.859
How many people could she possibly

41:10.861 --> 41:12.460
have been sleeping with at once?

41:15.031 --> 41:17.932
Yeah. I think she's lying.

41:17.934 --> 41:21.101
I actually think they were
seeing each other on and off

41:21.103 --> 41:22.770
when I was younger.

41:22.772 --> 41:27.274
You know, she'd leave a
week here, a week there.

41:27.276 --> 41:29.209
Once she left for six months.

41:35.917 --> 41:39.953
Yeah. Well, he's probably married.

41:39.955 --> 41:41.788
I'm sure you could find
him if you wanted to.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.056
And say what?

41:43.058 --> 41:45.725
"You're a shit. Thanks for nothing."

41:50.864 --> 41:53.465
What amazes me, though, is
that I spent my whole life

41:53.467 --> 41:55.901
trying not to become my mother,

41:55.903 --> 41:59.237
and, um... somehow that's...

41:59.239 --> 42:01.172
You haven't become her, Alison.

42:04.377 --> 42:05.810
Haven't I?

42:16.589 --> 42:19.056
Fires, oceans, and babies.

42:21.260 --> 42:25.361
Those are the things I could watch forever.

42:25.363 --> 42:28.197
Fires, oceans, babies.

42:42.513 --> 42:44.813
I don't know how you made
it through Gabriel's death.

42:49.620 --> 42:53.122
I thought about it a lot
when I was away, and just...

42:55.192 --> 42:58.492
29 years old, and you lose your child.

42:58.494 --> 43:00.895
No real parents, no
one to take care of you.

43:00.897 --> 43:04.065
I-I don't know how you survived.

43:04.067 --> 43:05.933
I didn't, really.

43:14.677 --> 43:17.610
Whoever I was back then, she...

43:19.548 --> 43:21.481
She died when he did.

43:31.425 --> 43:33.358
No, but I, um...

43:35.563 --> 43:37.930
I did have someone taking care of me.

43:41.569 --> 43:43.335
I had Cole.

43:57.250 --> 43:59.617
Did your dad leave you anything?

44:03.256 --> 44:05.789
Yeah... His house.

44:05.791 --> 44:07.691
What? He didn't leave it to Nina?

44:07.693 --> 44:08.959
Nope.

44:08.961 --> 44:11.528
That's weird, isn't it?

44:11.530 --> 44:13.463
Yeah, it is weird.

44:14.900 --> 44:18.869
When was the last time you were there?

44:18.871 --> 44:20.370
I don't know.

44:20.372 --> 44:22.238
Twenty years ago.

44:22.240 --> 44:24.473
You haven't been back in 20 years?

44:24.475 --> 44:25.842
Why not?

44:32.751 --> 44:35.618
My mother died there.

44:35.620 --> 44:37.319
Noah,

44:37.321 --> 44:41.156
I-I just assumed that
she died in a hospital.

44:46.329 --> 44:47.829
No, she was...

44:47.831 --> 44:49.931
She was sick for a long time.

44:51.935 --> 44:55.602
My dad couldn't handle
it. He basically left home.

44:55.604 --> 44:56.971
And Nina got out of there

44:56.973 --> 45:01.508
as soon as high school was over, so...

45:01.510 --> 45:02.509
In the end,

45:02.511 --> 45:04.779
it was just me and Ma.

45:08.584 --> 45:12.351
I remember the day I
heard I got into Williams.

45:12.353 --> 45:13.987
Full-ride.

45:17.458 --> 45:19.625
It was the worst day of my life.

45:23.098 --> 45:24.463
Why?

45:26.434 --> 45:29.968
'Cause I knew I couldn't go.

45:31.939 --> 45:35.207
I mean, who'd... who'd take
care of her if I was gone?

45:41.215 --> 45:42.314
I hid the letter.

45:42.316 --> 45:44.016
I wasn't gonna tell her, but...

45:44.018 --> 45:45.317
I was gonna pretend

45:45.319 --> 45:46.483
I didn't get in.

45:46.485 --> 45:49.287
They called the school. High school.

45:49.289 --> 45:53.657
Because that's what they do
with all the scholarship kids.

45:53.659 --> 45:56.861
And the principal called my mother, and...

45:59.866 --> 46:01.699
She was so excited.

46:06.138 --> 46:09.239
She started to cry, and then she...

46:16.815 --> 46:19.515
Then she nearly choked on her own...

46:22.854 --> 46:24.253
Noah, I'm sorry.

46:24.255 --> 46:26.255
It's a horrible disease.

46:32.263 --> 46:35.430
Anyway, it was...

46:35.432 --> 46:36.865
It was like a month before

46:36.867 --> 46:40.969
I graduated from senior year.

46:43.206 --> 46:46.640
And she told me that she'd decided to die.

46:50.280 --> 46:53.014
She was gonna... you know.

46:53.016 --> 46:54.447
What?

46:54.449 --> 46:56.216
What, for you?

46:58.420 --> 47:02.722
Well, she never said that, but...

47:02.724 --> 47:04.024
She knew about the scholarship

47:04.026 --> 47:07.127
and she knew she was alone, so...

47:09.965 --> 47:11.864
The problem was her hands.

47:11.866 --> 47:13.632
Her... her hands?

47:15.370 --> 47:16.903
Yeah, I mean, the MS,

47:16.905 --> 47:19.538
it... made them so gnarled

47:19.540 --> 47:23.475
that she... she couldn't
open the pill bottle.

47:25.046 --> 47:27.213
She couldn't even swallow the pills.

47:29.549 --> 47:31.549
So, I...

47:36.256 --> 47:39.891
So I crushed them up for her and...

47:39.893 --> 47:43.395
Mixed them with yogurt.

47:43.397 --> 47:44.729
Noah.

47:50.469 --> 47:52.970
And we spent the day together.

47:54.974 --> 47:57.308
I read to her.

47:57.310 --> 48:00.610
Just headlines and some short stories,

48:00.612 --> 48:03.913
and... her favorite poems.

48:08.186 --> 48:11.654
And then she told me I'd been a...

48:15.126 --> 48:17.493
Hey.

48:23.633 --> 48:26.835
She told me I'd been
a wonderful son, and...

48:30.841 --> 48:32.774
Then I fed the yogurt to her.

48:37.046 --> 48:41.015
Like she was my child.

48:42.618 --> 48:44.651
Noah, here.

48:46.155 --> 48:48.990
Shh.

48:57.632 --> 49:00.733
I thought about you all the time.

49:00.735 --> 49:02.502
When I was in prison, I
thought about you all the time.

49:02.504 --> 49:04.704
I kept asking myself,

49:04.706 --> 49:06.839
"What is it about her..." about you...

49:06.841 --> 49:10.542
"What..."

49:10.544 --> 49:13.545
You just the wrong
person at the wrong time?

49:13.547 --> 49:15.881
Why did I just blow up my whole life

49:15.883 --> 49:17.649
for a girl I met at a diner?

49:17.651 --> 49:21.353
"Why do I still love you so much?"

49:21.355 --> 49:24.356
And I never could find the answer.

49:24.358 --> 49:28.993
But... but you were sitting
there talking about Gabriel,

49:28.995 --> 49:33.231
and I realized...

49:33.233 --> 49:36.534
You're the only person I've ever met...

49:36.536 --> 49:40.171
The only other person I've met who...

49:40.173 --> 49:43.007
Who watched someone they love die.

50:58.012 --> 51:00.679
So, I'm a loser?

51:02.117 --> 51:03.382
Is that it?

51:08.656 --> 51:11.590
No, man, you... you got
nothing to do with these pages.

51:17.531 --> 51:20.031
I fucked your wife this morning.

51:37.483 --> 51:39.450
Fuck.

51:47.359 --> 51:49.392
Just shut the fuck up.

51:49.394 --> 51:50.993
- I'll fucking kill you.
- What the...

51:50.995 --> 51:52.328
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

51:52.330 --> 51:54.063
You fucking prick! I'll fucking kill you!

51:54.065 --> 51:55.731
- What? Seriously?
- I'll kill you!

51:55.733 --> 51:57.300
- The fuck!
- You fucking asshole!

51:57.302 --> 51:58.801
You're fucking going in the hole now!

51:58.803 --> 52:00.369
I don't fucking care! Fuck you, bitch!

52:00.371 --> 52:01.703
You're going in the box!

52:01.705 --> 52:03.238
I'll fucking kill you! I don't care!

52:13.884 --> 52:15.417
Stop resisting!

52:15.419 --> 52:16.518
Fuck you!

53:40.065 --> 53:41.598
I'll walk you out.

53:56.281 --> 53:59.547
So, who is this friend
who's loaned you a car?

54:02.619 --> 54:04.185
No one you know.

54:40.855 --> 54:42.789
I'll leave first.

56:26.622 --> 56:27.754
Fuck.

56:34.562 --> 56:35.961
Fuck.
