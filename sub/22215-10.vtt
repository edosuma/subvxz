00:11.844 --> 00:14.868
Now ends the Druid Order.

00:27.387 --> 00:29.083
He won't stay down for long.

00:30.386 --> 00:31.995
You must find Wil.

00:32.894 --> 00:34.093
He is our last hope.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.266
I'm not leaving without you.

00:38.838 --> 00:41.272
Go now. Find Wil!

00:44.377 --> 00:46.444
Father, you're too weak, he'll kill you!

00:47.747 --> 00:49.681
I must try to end this now.

00:50.317 --> 00:51.349
No!

01:10.170 --> 01:11.202
Don't be afraid.

01:12.105 --> 01:13.905
I will always be with you.

01:14.941 --> 01:15.973
Now go.

01:46.873 --> 01:48.106
- Mareth.
- Wil!

01:48.113 --> 01:49.212
The Warlock Lord is here!

01:49.219 --> 01:51.286
- Allanon saved me, but...
- I have to help.

01:51.293 --> 01:53.393
He can't take him alone. Allanon!

02:05.656 --> 02:06.989
No!

02:07.327 --> 02:08.658
_

02:20.894 --> 02:21.973
No!

02:23.865 --> 02:24.931
Wil!

02:32.352 --> 02:33.518
Allanon!

02:39.426 --> 02:43.127
<i>I feel it running through my veins â™ª</i>

03:24.395 --> 03:25.428
He can't be gone.

03:26.397 --> 03:27.530
I should have been here.

03:29.901 --> 03:31.868
This is no time for regret.

03:31.970 --> 03:34.152
We were caught off guard,
and we paid the price.

03:34.439 --> 03:35.972
The Warlock Lord is gone.

03:36.074 --> 03:37.872
He must be on his way to Heaven's Well.

03:37.879 --> 03:39.712
We have to go after him.

03:41.546 --> 03:43.207
He died for nothing.

03:43.214 --> 03:45.481
No. He died to protect you.

03:46.217 --> 03:47.483
He was right to do so.

03:57.462 --> 03:59.495
This world owes Allanon a great debt.

04:13.451 --> 04:15.013
We're gonna do what Allanon wanted

04:15.947 --> 04:16.978
and we're gonna fight.

04:18.182 --> 04:19.281
This isn't over.

04:20.985 --> 04:23.853
We cannot let your father's
sacrifice be in vain. Understand?

04:25.123 --> 04:27.990
There's no time for fear,
no time for doubt.

04:28.092 --> 04:29.725
Everything hangs in the balance.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.127
This doesn't work without
the both of you.

04:35.199 --> 04:37.099
The Druid and the Shannara.

05:19.377 --> 05:22.044
Please, Eretria, don't do this.

05:22.747 --> 05:23.779
Untie me.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.885
I brought you the Princess.

05:40.331 --> 05:41.831
Such beauty.

06:01.219 --> 06:04.120
Heaven's Well awaits.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.263
No signs of a siege.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.964
You think we made it in time?

06:49.067 --> 06:51.534
Can't say. But one way or another,

06:52.870 --> 06:54.170
the battle ends here.

07:04.148 --> 07:07.316
I want archers on every balcony.
Cover every approach.

07:07.418 --> 07:10.086
Do we know the size or scope
of the Warlock Lord's army?

07:10.188 --> 07:12.488
My scouts report no evidence of an army.

07:12.590 --> 07:14.757
If he is marching on Leah,
he's traveling light.

07:14.859 --> 07:17.770
Oh he's marching all right.
He wants Heaven's Well.

07:17.777 --> 07:19.423
Have your men
heard anything from Allanon?

07:19.430 --> 07:20.529
Nothing yet.

07:21.586 --> 07:24.821
You have your orders, people.
Now let's batten it down.

07:25.007 --> 07:27.107
And if this is our last show,

07:27.114 --> 07:28.714
let's make sure it's a damn good one.

07:33.816 --> 07:36.984
The river must flow with my blood.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.453
Yes, my lord.

07:40.422 --> 07:41.655
Eretria, please.

07:42.497 --> 07:43.896
Don't listen to him.

07:43.903 --> 07:45.770
Okay, I know you're still in there.

07:46.893 --> 07:48.926
If we let him have his way,

07:50.129 --> 07:52.396
my people, our friends,

07:53.065 --> 07:54.073
will die.

07:55.568 --> 07:57.301
I need you to fight for us.

07:57.308 --> 07:58.607
Enough!

08:11.684 --> 08:13.417
Do as I command.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.634
The Well is inside a temple,
behind those falls.

08:47.641 --> 08:48.840
You'll have to go up on foot.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.273
Spoken like a man
who's not coming with us.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.994
I must return to the palace
to protect the dam.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.745
If the Warlock Lord poisons
Heaven's Well,

08:58.847 --> 09:00.980
and his blood gets into the reservoir,

09:01.082 --> 09:02.382
the dam will be the only thing

09:02.484 --> 09:04.884
holding back the tide of darkness.

09:04.986 --> 09:07.120
Nothing quite like a Druid pep talk.

09:09.291 --> 09:11.824
You have the sword. You have each other.

09:11.927 --> 09:14.027
You've seen your truth,
and now you must embrace it.

09:15.497 --> 09:17.363
May the shades of your fathers
watch over you.

09:18.334 --> 09:19.361
Good luck.

09:46.394 --> 09:48.361
This is where your men should be
when we come in.

09:48.580 --> 09:49.658
Eretria,

09:50.699 --> 09:51.731
where's Allanon?

09:54.035 --> 09:56.302
Give it to me straight.
How screwed are we?

09:56.404 --> 09:57.937
The Warlock Lord has Lyria.

09:58.039 --> 09:59.839
And he's heading to Heaven's Well.

09:59.941 --> 10:01.607
We must protect the dam at all costs.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.578
Is there a control room
for the spillways?

10:06.923 --> 10:07.952
Follow me.

10:31.306 --> 10:34.540
Soon my shadow will
extend across the Four Lands.

10:44.652 --> 10:45.785
What do you want from me?

11:05.507 --> 11:08.107
You are the key.

11:37.572 --> 11:38.871
You're free now.

12:18.938 --> 12:21.211
We have to assume he's
already made it to the Well.

12:21.674 --> 12:22.739
Stay alert.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.543
- Wil, wait.
- What's up?

12:26.979 --> 12:28.178
Nothing. Just,

12:29.648 --> 12:32.115
everything actually.

12:32.218 --> 12:35.232
First Allanon tells me I'm
the future of the Druid Order,

12:35.239 --> 12:37.238
and now you're saying that
I'm Queen of the Elves,

12:37.245 --> 12:40.012
and now the fate of
the Four Lands is in our hands.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.893
It's a lot to carry.

12:42.995 --> 12:44.661
Do you remember when you stalked me

12:44.763 --> 12:47.598
at the tavern in Storlock
and you told me,

12:47.700 --> 12:49.166
what was it again?

12:49.268 --> 12:50.901
To drop the tortured loner act.

12:52.004 --> 12:54.037
And I wasn't stalking you.

12:54.139 --> 12:57.007
Uh. Well, I guess it's my turn to say

12:57.109 --> 13:00.444
you're a much better badass
than you are a reluctant hero.

13:03.048 --> 13:06.666
Look, I know I was kind
of a jerk to you when we first met.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.085
Kind of?

13:08.187 --> 13:09.753
What I'm trying to say is that

13:10.789 --> 13:12.322
I get it.

13:12.424 --> 13:14.391
I get why you didn't wanna help me.

13:14.493 --> 13:16.393
Why you couldn't just get over it.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.323
It's okay. You didn't know
what I'd been through.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.030
But you warned me.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.165
You told me that magic
would only bring me pain.

13:23.202 --> 13:24.668
So did Allanon.

13:24.770 --> 13:25.836
But I didn't listen.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.242
Until you have lived with magic,

13:32.344 --> 13:33.577
you can't know its price.

13:36.282 --> 13:38.582
You should know something,
while we're clearing the air.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.045
What?

13:40.052 --> 13:43.387
When we first met, I was just looking

13:43.489 --> 13:45.589
for an excuse to wallow in my pain.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.125
And you snapped me out of it.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.763
I wouldn't be here without you.
You know that, right?

13:55.567 --> 13:57.167
Good.

13:57.269 --> 13:59.670
Because there's no one
I'd rather have by my side.

14:02.715 --> 14:04.730
Well, then I guess
we've got some climbing to do.

14:08.762 --> 14:09.908
All right

14:51.218 --> 14:53.687
_

14:54.817 --> 14:56.904
_

14:57.202 --> 14:58.733
_

14:59.497 --> 15:01.606
_

15:02.537 --> 15:05.154
_

15:05.650 --> 15:07.876
_

15:12.049 --> 15:13.314
_

15:29.742 --> 15:31.742
This room controls the spillways.

15:31.844 --> 15:33.544
One way in, one way out.

15:33.551 --> 15:35.618
Designed to be impregnable
in the event of a siege.

15:44.824 --> 15:48.125
No demons.
Guess we beat 'em to the punch.

15:48.227 --> 15:50.127
They'll come.
It's just a matter of time.

16:02.575 --> 16:04.775
Heaven's Well feeds right into the lake.

16:04.877 --> 16:08.512
If Wil and Mareth fail it'll be up
to us to keep the spillway secure.

16:08.614 --> 16:10.281
We can lock it shut manually.

16:10.383 --> 16:12.416
We have to hand crank it from over here.

16:12.423 --> 16:13.739
Good. Then let's get started.

16:15.855 --> 16:17.955
Station as many of your men
outside as you can.

16:18.524 --> 16:19.590
No one gets in or out.

16:20.259 --> 16:22.493
And, Jax, be careful.

16:23.763 --> 16:25.596
- We don't know what's coming.
- Understood.

16:27.166 --> 16:28.432
I'll see you on the other side.

16:33.506 --> 16:34.638
Can I have a hand over here?

16:38.711 --> 16:39.810
Sure thing.

16:42.448 --> 16:44.315
Lyria!

16:44.417 --> 16:45.983
Hey, you okay?

16:48.554 --> 16:51.155
The Warlock Lord used me
to get into Heaven's Well.

16:51.824 --> 16:52.856
Where's Eretria?

16:52.958 --> 16:55.559
The palace. She's gonna try
to sabotage the dam.

16:55.661 --> 16:58.429
You need to get back there. Help
Cogline stop her if you can.

16:58.531 --> 16:59.663
Be careful.

17:00.033 --> 17:01.160
You too.

17:07.355 --> 17:08.420
Guess this is it.

17:09.137 --> 17:10.223
All right.

17:31.831 --> 17:33.831
Can you feel it?

17:35.568 --> 17:36.667
Feel what?

17:39.038 --> 17:40.104
Destiny.

17:46.345 --> 17:47.578
Wil, we're too late!

17:58.324 --> 17:59.957
It has begun!

18:00.526 --> 18:01.592
No!

18:09.702 --> 18:12.703
My blood now runs
through the Silver River.

18:28.101 --> 18:29.367
We're too late.

18:29.637 --> 18:31.203
The Warlock Lord has infected the well.

18:32.136 --> 18:33.869
If that water gets through the dam,

18:33.971 --> 18:37.439
it'll turn everyone in this valley
and beyond into soulless slaves.

18:37.446 --> 18:38.679
The battle's not over yet.

18:38.686 --> 18:41.387
We have to keep that spillway
secure for as long as we can.

18:41.394 --> 18:42.973
I'll take you to the control room.

18:42.980 --> 18:44.346
Eretria's already down there.

18:46.116 --> 18:47.148
Eretria?

18:48.119 --> 18:50.619
Yeah. She said you sent her.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.288
She's become a pawn of the Warlock Lord.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.457
We may already be too late.

19:07.071 --> 19:08.170
This ends now.

19:08.272 --> 19:11.807
You will fail. Just like your father.

19:13.611 --> 19:16.211
Wil is stronger than Shea
and stronger than you.

19:17.515 --> 19:20.249
And are you your father's daughter?

19:21.018 --> 19:22.985
A failure like him?

19:24.055 --> 19:26.088
I felt your pain.

19:26.924 --> 19:28.824
Let me show you.

19:39.637 --> 19:43.639
He was so weak.

19:46.877 --> 19:48.110
I'm not afraid of you.

20:16.974 --> 20:18.340
Eretria, open the door!

20:23.614 --> 20:24.646
Back away from the door.

20:38.695 --> 20:39.770
Eretria!

20:43.033 --> 20:44.533
Quickly, close the dam.

20:44.635 --> 20:46.835
The blood is already flowing
into the Four Lands.

20:46.937 --> 20:47.970
She broke the wheel.

20:53.377 --> 20:54.409
Grandal!

21:14.365 --> 21:15.379
Come on, girl.

21:16.682 --> 21:18.157
Don't make me have to put you down.

21:22.239 --> 21:25.240
She's alive. But we need to get
that Wraith out of her now.

21:38.289 --> 21:39.988
How do we know this won't kill her?

21:40.090 --> 21:44.026
I don't. If we don't get this thing
out of her, she'll die anyway.

21:44.128 --> 21:46.028
This is an ancient Druid rite.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.630
Blood magic, very dangerous.

21:53.407 --> 21:54.479
Sit her up.

21:56.340 --> 21:57.940
And when I pull the Wraith out,

21:58.042 --> 22:00.309
it will try and escape. Don't let it.

22:06.803 --> 22:08.842
_

22:12.563 --> 22:14.790
_

22:18.172 --> 22:20.203
_

22:22.556 --> 22:24.155
Get ready! It's almost out.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.165
_

22:39.951 --> 22:41.142
Fire it up.

22:42.142 --> 22:43.312
Hit it!

22:48.964 --> 22:50.297
_

23:11.880 --> 23:13.411
Eretria, look at me...

23:13.817 --> 23:14.850
Where am I?

23:18.255 --> 23:20.322
Eretria, come back to me.

23:21.548 --> 23:22.741
You're safe.

23:36.268 --> 23:37.501
He's too powerful.

23:37.508 --> 23:39.274
I have to use the sword.
It's the only way.

23:41.185 --> 23:45.287
Darkness and light
cannot exist together.

23:45.389 --> 23:46.688
We need to get closer.

23:46.695 --> 23:47.828
I'll give you an opening.

23:47.871 --> 23:51.888
When darkness triumphs, light shall die,

23:51.895 --> 23:54.763
and you will both meet
the same fate as your fathers.

23:58.235 --> 24:01.103
Step forward, and show yourselves.

24:02.106 --> 24:03.347
Here I am.

24:05.876 --> 24:07.909
Light always overcomes darkness.

24:40.230 --> 24:42.525
<i>You must sink the blade
straight through his heart.</i>

24:42.532 --> 24:44.199
Nothing can stop me.

24:51.341 --> 24:53.575
Now you will learn like your father...

24:56.179 --> 24:57.612
Go join him...

24:58.682 --> 24:59.714
Shannara.

25:13.163 --> 25:14.629
<i>You are the next Druid.</i>

25:15.899 --> 25:16.931
<i>It is time.</i>

25:17.767 --> 25:19.701
I will always be with you.

25:35.585 --> 25:36.684
Wil!

26:20.630 --> 26:22.764
We did it. We beat him.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.533
We did. You did.

26:38.048 --> 26:39.147
The Well,

26:40.684 --> 26:41.716
it's still poisoned.

26:44.921 --> 26:46.187
I thought if we defeated him...

26:55.332 --> 26:56.431
Mareth,

26:57.267 --> 26:58.333
look.

27:03.641 --> 27:04.649
Wil,

27:04.656 --> 27:06.120
You're a Shannara,

27:06.127 --> 27:08.590
<i>the magic of your ancestors
runs through your blood.</i>

27:09.041 --> 27:11.741
It can defeat the Warlock Lord
and cleanse the world of evil.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.453
What's happening?

27:18.460 --> 27:21.579
Shea said the magic in my blood
could cleanse the world of evil.

27:31.159 --> 27:32.492
I have to finish this.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.776
What are you doing?

27:41.783 --> 27:44.350
I can't heal myself
and save the Four Lands.

27:45.260 --> 27:47.694
I give you these Elfstones freely.

27:47.701 --> 27:50.702
Use them to protect
the people of the Four Lands.

27:50.709 --> 27:52.910
You're going to be right there with me.

27:53.164 --> 27:56.532
- Druid and Shannara, remember?
- Listen to me.

27:56.711 --> 27:59.478
The water is infected.
It's already spread.

28:00.782 --> 28:01.881
But I can stop it.

28:03.118 --> 28:05.318
I didn't understand before,
but now I do.

28:07.256 --> 28:08.388
My father was right.

28:10.125 --> 28:11.558
There's gotta be another way.

28:14.696 --> 28:16.229
The magic is in my blood.

28:18.033 --> 28:19.599
It was inside me this whole time.

28:27.910 --> 28:29.776
You just make sure our people are okay.

31:07.269 --> 31:09.469
- Look!
- Wil and Mareth did it!

31:10.505 --> 31:13.354
The Warlock Lord is no more.

31:13.361 --> 31:16.762
Those guys just earned themselves a
helluva hangover when they get back.

31:16.837 --> 31:18.470
And I'm buying.

32:02.351 --> 32:05.051
With this crown,
we acknowledge a new Queen,

32:05.821 --> 32:07.220
Lyria of Leah.

32:08.256 --> 32:11.057
May her reign be
a long and peaceful one.

32:19.468 --> 32:21.735
The battle for our kingdom may be won.

32:22.971 --> 32:25.405
But now it is time to rebuild,

32:25.507 --> 32:27.741
not just our walls,
but our hearts' resolve.

32:29.177 --> 32:31.211
Our future wouldn't exist

32:31.313 --> 32:33.279
if it weren't for those
that we mourn today.

32:34.316 --> 32:36.750
Heroes like my mother,

32:38.920 --> 32:40.086
King Ander,

32:41.289 --> 32:43.105
the Druid Allanon

32:44.659 --> 32:46.249
and Wil Ohmsford.

32:53.769 --> 32:55.301
They gave their lives.

32:56.304 --> 32:58.371
And in return, it is our duty

32:58.473 --> 33:00.340
to heed the lesson that they offered,

33:01.450 --> 33:05.285
that good will always triumph over evil

33:07.182 --> 33:08.648
and that love conquers all.

33:14.723 --> 33:15.822
Hear, hear!

33:16.358 --> 33:17.390
Hear, hear!

33:18.014 --> 33:19.647
Long live the Queen!

33:26.842 --> 33:28.241
Long live the Queen!

33:36.978 --> 33:38.411
You sounded pretty wise up there.

33:39.948 --> 33:41.181
That crown suits you.

33:41.283 --> 33:42.949
I feel like a fraud, honestly.

33:43.051 --> 33:45.685
I know. I know you never wanted this,

33:46.688 --> 33:49.823
but the people need you.
They need your strength.

33:51.059 --> 33:53.226
I used to think that
I was better off on my own.

33:54.596 --> 33:55.829
Turns out I was wrong.

33:57.666 --> 33:58.898
About a lot of things.

34:00.769 --> 34:02.035
I love you, Lyria.

34:04.573 --> 34:06.439
And maybe someday we'll be together.

34:07.375 --> 34:08.474
Just not yet.

34:23.859 --> 34:28.161
This darkness inside me,
it's still in there.

34:28.263 --> 34:30.929
And I don't ever wanna hurt
the people I care about again.

34:32.833 --> 34:33.933
Especially you.

34:51.418 --> 34:54.186
Go do what you gotta do
and then come back to me.

34:56.257 --> 34:57.357
Okay?

35:20.583 --> 35:23.083
I'm sorry about Wil. He was a good man.

35:23.451 --> 35:24.584
Thanks.

35:24.591 --> 35:26.408
I know he would say the same about you.

35:28.549 --> 35:30.983
It was an honor fighting
alongside you, old timer.

35:31.085 --> 35:32.585
Our kingdom owes you a great debt.

35:32.687 --> 35:36.355
Our kingdom? I thought The Weapons
Master was a one man show.

35:36.457 --> 35:38.858
That was before I had people
worth fighting for.

35:38.960 --> 35:42.194
Besides, not all of us
can be magical badasses.

35:42.297 --> 35:44.084
I think you're gonna
make a great general.

35:47.168 --> 35:48.401
Come on, we're losing light.

35:54.409 --> 35:55.608
Keep the Queen safe for me.

35:56.744 --> 35:57.810
Count on it.

35:58.946 --> 36:01.642
I'm sorry about
what happened at the dam.

36:01.649 --> 36:03.149
That wasn't you.

36:03.251 --> 36:05.117
The Eretria I know is loyal to the end.

36:15.596 --> 36:16.762
See you around, General.

38:13.848 --> 38:16.148
He'd be proud of what
you've accomplished. Know that.

38:19.854 --> 38:22.121
You honor him with your courage.

38:22.230 --> 38:24.530
There's no one better
to carry on his legacy.

38:25.703 --> 38:27.836
That legacy belongs to you both now.

38:27.843 --> 38:29.743
There is much to learn.

38:29.750 --> 38:32.017
The question is, are you ready
to continue your training?

38:35.998 --> 38:38.666
Then it's time to continue
the Druid Order.

38:48.470 --> 38:50.003
Mareth? What is it?

38:51.652 --> 38:53.352
For a second, I felt like,

38:54.822 --> 38:56.180
like Wil was here with us.

39:07.253 --> 39:09.396
Sometimes our fate chooses us instead.

39:23.484 --> 39:24.717
Wil is still alive.

39:26.320 --> 39:27.419
Somewhere.
