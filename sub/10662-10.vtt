00:00.322 --> 00:03.389
The Carmichael Show is taped in
front of a live studio audience.

00:03.391 --> 00:04.757
(exclaims)

00:04.759 --> 00:06.279
Thank you for that French toast, Mama.

00:06.303 --> 00:07.660
Freedom toast, Bobby.

00:07.662 --> 00:09.162
(chuckles)

00:09.164 --> 00:10.830
Joe, when are you gonna let that go?

00:10.832 --> 00:14.867
There's nothing more American
than holding onto a grudge.

00:14.869 --> 00:17.270
Look, either way, it
was a powerful breakfast,

00:17.272 --> 00:18.972
because I was powerful hungry.

00:18.974 --> 00:21.541
You know, that's how Huck Finn
a-a-and Tom Sawyer used to talk.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.242
It was "powerful" this, "powerful" that.

00:23.244 --> 00:25.111
You know, I'm reading the classics now.

00:25.879 --> 00:27.113
Bobby, you were supposed

00:27.115 --> 00:29.816
to read those books
while yowere in school.

00:29.818 --> 00:32.098
Oh, but I was supposed to read
them in summer school, too,

00:32.122 --> 00:33.786
but here we are.

00:33.788 --> 00:34.887
Hey.

00:34.889 --> 00:35.855
Hey, y'all.

00:35.857 --> 00:37.123
Sorry we're late.

00:37.125 --> 00:39.659
Yeah, you guys are not
gonna believe what happened.

00:39.661 --> 00:41.160
So, we were getting ready to leave,

00:41.162 --> 00:42.929
and Jerrod's car had a flat tire...

00:42.931 --> 00:46.532
Well, so far, that is
very believable, Maxine.

00:46.534 --> 00:48.334
...and Jerrod said that he
didn't want to be bothered

00:48.336 --> 00:50.096
with changing it so I
said, "I'll change it,"

00:50.120 --> 00:51.270
and you know what he did?

00:51.272 --> 00:53.106
He laughed in my face.

00:53.108 --> 00:55.408
Maxine, I told you,
I only laughed 'cause

00:55.410 --> 00:57.677
I found it really, really funny.

00:59.747 --> 01:01.314
It is funny!

01:01.316 --> 01:02.281
That's funny, right?

01:02.283 --> 01:04.751
(laughing): Yeah, Maxine,

01:04.753 --> 01:07.854
Danica Patrick doesn't
even change her own tires.

01:07.856 --> 01:10.156
Why is the notion of me
changing a tire so absurd?

01:10.158 --> 01:12.859
Come on, Maxine, don't
make us say it out loud.

01:12.861 --> 01:14.794
Say what?

01:14.796 --> 01:16.829
(groans)

01:17.798 --> 01:19.799
Ah, it feels like a trap.

01:19.801 --> 01:23.169
Yeah, that's not something
you want to say out loud.

01:23.171 --> 01:25.291
You know, that's like all
the thoughts that go through

01:25.315 --> 01:27.740
your mind when you're
talking to a little person.

01:27.742 --> 01:29.042
Yeah.

01:29.044 --> 01:31.077
Am I missing something?

01:31.079 --> 01:33.780
They're saying a woman
shouldn't change a tire.

01:33.782 --> 01:35.048
- Yup, that's it.
- Yeah.

01:35.050 --> 01:36.182
Yeah, that's pretty much
what we're saying, yeah, yeah.

01:36.184 --> 01:37.817
Maxine, why did you make me

01:37.819 --> 01:39.952
say that sexist thing out loud?

01:39.954 --> 01:42.555
It don't feel good.

01:42.557 --> 01:44.290
Yeah, Maxine, it's 2016.

01:44.292 --> 01:47.694
How dare you make my mama
say something like that.

01:47.696 --> 01:49.462
Just not cool.

01:49.464 --> 01:51.397
Yeah, it's 2016, Bobby,

01:51.399 --> 01:53.099
men and women should be treated equally.

01:53.101 --> 01:55.334
Do men and women really
want to be treated equally?

01:55.336 --> 01:56.636
Okay, now,

01:56.638 --> 01:58.604
there's this guy at work,
we call him Big Mike.

01:58.606 --> 02:01.107
Now there's a woman at work
who's even bigger than Mike,

02:01.109 --> 02:02.775
and one day I called her Big Sherry,

02:02.777 --> 02:04.610
almost lost my damn job.

02:05.846 --> 02:08.815
See, you get around women,
you got to be delicate.

02:08.817 --> 02:12.118
Wow, I can't believe how
you guys are sounding,

02:12.120 --> 02:14.040
especially you, Jerrod,
because you don't believe

02:14.064 --> 02:15.354
that women are delicate flowers

02:15.356 --> 02:17.056
who are supposed to
be kept in their place.

02:17.058 --> 02:18.758
Yeah, well, it sounds horrible
when you say it like that.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.127
Now had you said that men are
better suited at certain tasks

02:21.129 --> 02:23.129
than women, I would have
given you one of these.

02:24.064 --> 02:25.631
What?

02:25.633 --> 02:26.899
You know, some people would say

02:26.901 --> 02:29.435
not letting a woman fix
a tire is chivalrous.

02:29.437 --> 02:30.870
And I'm one of those people.

02:30.872 --> 02:33.072
The sexiest thing a man can do for me

02:33.074 --> 02:35.141
is to tell me to sit down.

02:36.210 --> 02:38.678
Yeah, okay, but there is a difference

02:38.680 --> 02:41.347
between chivalry and sexism.

02:41.349 --> 02:43.449
Yeah, but it's hard to see
that difference, Maxine.

02:43.451 --> 02:46.319
Chivalry and sexism are,
like, Olsen twins similar.

02:46.321 --> 02:48.354
I can't believe how crazy this sounds.

02:48.356 --> 02:50.516
I mean, you're making it
sound like we live in the '50s

02:50.540 --> 02:53.192
where all the woman does is
cook and clean while the man

02:53.194 --> 02:54.727
just sits there and rubs his stomach.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.265
(scoffs)

03:01.435 --> 03:03.603
Is this what déjà vu is?

03:04.805 --> 03:06.439
Look, Maxine, I'm just saying

03:06.441 --> 03:08.040
that we kind of have our own roles.

03:08.042 --> 03:10.009
Like, when's the last time
you took out the garbage?

03:10.011 --> 03:11.277
You don't do that 'cause you're a man,

03:11.279 --> 03:12.745
you do that 'cause it's
what you like to do.

03:12.747 --> 03:14.787
Yeah, I'm not complaining,
but it's just what we do.

03:14.811 --> 03:16.849
I take out the garbage and
then you do the laundry.

03:16.851 --> 03:17.817
Yes,

03:17.819 --> 03:18.818
I do the laundry,

03:18.820 --> 03:20.153
but I only do it because if you did it

03:20.155 --> 03:21.487
you would mix all the colors together,

03:21.489 --> 03:23.089
and you'd shrink
everything in the dryer.

03:23.091 --> 03:25.411
Of course, I don't like reading
those little tags, and plus

03:25.435 --> 03:27.827
I don't believe in
segregation of any kind.

03:27.829 --> 03:28.828
Well, I don't cook.

03:28.830 --> 03:30.029
I know you don't cook.

03:30.031 --> 03:32.417
I mean, wouldn't be mad
at you if you did, though.

03:32.418 --> 03:34.600
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, is that asking for too much?

03:34.602 --> 03:36.736
I'm just saying, look, Maxine,

03:36.738 --> 03:38.371
we have different roles.

03:38.373 --> 03:41.174
I mean, w-who-who's the one
that always loads the dishwasher?

03:41.176 --> 03:43.342
Because you never
rinse the dishes first.

03:43.344 --> 03:45.144
What's the point of having a dishwasher

03:45.146 --> 03:46.813
if you've got to rinse off the dishes?!

03:48.081 --> 03:50.383
We have a system that works, all right?

03:50.385 --> 03:52.285
I like it, you like
it, what's the problem?

03:52.287 --> 03:55.254
I don't like being told a
woman's place, Jerrod, and

03:55.256 --> 03:58.257
for the record, the men in this
family aren't particularly manly

03:58.259 --> 03:59.525
at all.

03:59.527 --> 04:02.261
Why, I never.

04:02.263 --> 04:03.863
Oh, come on, Joe.

04:03.865 --> 04:05.898
Look, your favorite
actor is Sandra Bullock,

04:05.900 --> 04:07.333
and, Bobby,

04:07.335 --> 04:10.703
you cry more than any woman
I have ever met in my life.

04:10.705 --> 04:11.771
Well, look here, Maxine,

04:11.773 --> 04:13.613
if you're trying to make
me cry, it's too late.

04:13.637 --> 04:16.805
I cried a bunch of tears this morning.

04:18.612 --> 04:20.146
Yeah, and, Jerrod,

04:20.148 --> 04:22.067
you have the arms of a
person who's been battling

04:22.091 --> 04:23.732
a heroin addiction
for the last ten years.

04:25.452 --> 04:26.986
- Now that is not true.
- Thank you.

04:26.988 --> 04:30.723
A heroin addict has
veins and definition.

04:31.725 --> 04:36.362
If anything, my son has
the arms of a snowman.

04:36.364 --> 04:37.597
No, no,

04:37.599 --> 04:39.065
Mama, I don't-I don't about that.

04:39.067 --> 04:41.307
I mean, I've seen snowmen
with some big branches on them.

04:41.331 --> 04:42.168
Maxine,

04:42.170 --> 04:44.003
who you think built
this roof over your head?

04:44.005 --> 04:45.972
- Me and my sons.
- JERROD: That's right.

04:45.974 --> 04:49.008
You reshingled half the
roof about ten years ago,

04:49.010 --> 04:52.211
so I don't know what
you're bragging about.

04:52.213 --> 04:54.780
Now, Mama, that was the
hottest summer on record.

04:54.782 --> 04:57.149
You wanted us to die up there?

04:57.151 --> 04:59.952
Yeah, see, Cynthia, they're
not as manly as they claim.

04:59.954 --> 05:01.187
I'm not taking sides.

05:01.189 --> 05:03.389
I'm just saying I want my roof finished.

05:03.391 --> 05:04.523
Well, you know what, Ma,

05:04.525 --> 05:07.126
maybe today is the day
that we finish the roof.

05:07.128 --> 05:08.761
(laughs)

05:08.763 --> 05:10.663
Oh, you're gonna...
you're gonna fix the roof?

05:10.665 --> 05:12.398
Yes, yes, I'm gonna
fix the roof, Maxine.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.599
It's a man's job.

05:13.601 --> 05:16.035
Let's not be so civil
that we deny reality.

05:16.037 --> 05:17.370
There are men's jobs.

05:17.372 --> 05:18.671
Let me ask you a question.

05:18.673 --> 05:19.705
If you're walking down the street,

05:19.707 --> 05:20.907
you saw a building being built

05:20.909 --> 05:22.375
by an all female construction crew,

05:22.377 --> 05:24.744
would you go in that building?

05:24.746 --> 05:27.079
Of course. That's a stupid question.

05:27.081 --> 05:29.348
Please. There's no way
you're gonna risk your life

05:29.350 --> 05:30.449
for feminism, Maxine.

05:30.451 --> 05:31.784
JOE: That settles it.

05:31.786 --> 05:34.086
The Carmichael men are
gonna finish the roof!

05:34.088 --> 05:35.855
- Yes.
- Ooh, a battle

05:35.857 --> 05:37.490
of the sexes. That's right, Mama,

05:37.492 --> 05:39.458
we're about to give
you broads the business.

05:39.460 --> 05:40.760
Bobby!

05:40.762 --> 05:42.995
Sorry about that. I
just love challenges.

05:42.997 --> 05:45.131
Not only are we gonna fix the roof,

05:45.133 --> 05:47.366
but we'll do so before
you can have a chance

05:47.368 --> 05:48.634
to change that flat tire.

05:48.636 --> 05:51.070
Oh, so you're allowing
me to fix the tire now?

05:51.072 --> 05:54.073
Maxine, not only am I
allowing you to fix the time,

05:54.075 --> 05:55.808
I'm timing it.

05:55.810 --> 05:58.644
Oh, it's on like Donkey Kong!

05:58.646 --> 06:00.980
Come on, "on like Donkey Kong"?

06:00.982 --> 06:03.649
You're gonna embarrass me in
front of my mama like that?

06:04.785 --> 06:06.252
Come on, Cynthia, we can do this.

06:06.254 --> 06:08.487
"It's on like Donkey Kong"?

06:08.489 --> 06:10.189
What the hell was that, Maxine?

06:10.191 --> 06:13.326
I got caught up in the
moment. Let's move past it.

06:13.328 --> 06:15.227
Look, I need a ride,
'cause we Ubered here.

06:15.229 --> 06:17.830
Mm-mm, I just sat down...
I ain't gettin' up.

06:17.832 --> 06:19.966
Come on, Cynthia. We need to prove

06:19.968 --> 06:23.002
to these men that women
can do anything men can do.

06:23.004 --> 06:25.204
Pass.

06:25.206 --> 06:26.772
I'll give you a hundred bucks.

06:26.774 --> 06:28.774
Well, why didn't you say so?

06:28.776 --> 06:31.610
Wasting time with all
this feminist jargon!

06:31.612 --> 06:33.479
Show me the money!

06:33.481 --> 06:35.081
Oh, "on like Donkey Kong" is bad,

06:35.083 --> 06:37.016
but "show me the money" is okay?

06:37.018 --> 06:39.251
No. I'm not quoting anybody.

06:39.253 --> 06:42.488
I mean, actually show me the money.

08:05.609 --> 08:08.144
All right, before you do any repair job,

08:08.146 --> 08:10.846
it's important that you
got the proper equipment.

08:10.848 --> 08:13.783
Failure to do so can and
will get both of y'all killed.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.585
So let's do a checklist. Hammer!

08:15.587 --> 08:16.586
- Yeah.
- Check.

08:16.588 --> 08:17.987
- Nails!
- Yeah. - Check.

08:17.989 --> 08:20.189
That's the end of the checklist.

08:20.191 --> 08:21.524
Wait, a hammer?

08:21.526 --> 08:23.292
How come we can't use a nail gun?

08:23.294 --> 08:24.727
That seems way faster.

08:24.729 --> 08:27.597
Well, I'm not letting you two
idiots mess with a nail gun.

08:27.599 --> 08:30.433
You can't even work a stapler
without winding up in the E.R.

BOBBY: Look...

08:31.736 --> 08:34.703
Daddy, they tell you not to
look down a barrel of a gun,

08:34.706 --> 08:37.807
but nobody ever says it about staplers!

08:37.808 --> 08:39.674
All right, now, look, we got to rip off

08:39.677 --> 08:41.577
all these shingles here on this side

08:41.578 --> 08:44.347
- before we put down the new ones.
- Wait, wait, we can't just

08:44.349 --> 08:45.915
put the new ones over the old ones?

08:45.917 --> 08:48.784
I tried that, Bobby... it don't work.

08:48.786 --> 08:50.306
All right, I'm with y'all in a second.

08:50.308 --> 08:52.748
Let me take these shoes off...
I don't want to get them dirty.

08:52.772 --> 08:54.991
You can't be barefoot
on a construction site.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.792
Dad, did you see these?

08:56.794 --> 08:58.661
They're limited.

08:59.696 --> 09:02.031
Are they more limited than your feet?

09:02.033 --> 09:04.574
Oh. Whoa, whoa, wait.
Come here, come here.

09:04.575 --> 09:06.102
Is that a naked woman over there?

09:06.104 --> 09:07.603
Ooh. Where?

09:07.605 --> 09:09.605
There, two houses down. Didn't we go

09:09.607 --> 09:11.040
to high school with her?

09:11.042 --> 09:12.174
I don't know.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.143
I need her to flip over.

09:14.145 --> 09:16.779
(chuckles): Oh, yeah, we
went to high school with her.

09:16.781 --> 09:17.947
Yeah.

09:17.949 --> 09:20.282
All right, let's enjoy
this father-son moment,

09:20.284 --> 09:23.285
gaze at this butt-naked sunbather.

09:23.287 --> 09:25.454
Then we'll get right back to work.

09:29.259 --> 09:31.227
This is nice.

09:32.396 --> 09:34.497
All right, who wants to bang some nails?

09:37.734 --> 09:39.468
(car alarm beeps)

09:39.470 --> 09:42.204
We are independent women
doing it for ourselves.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.439
Calm down.

09:43.441 --> 09:45.408
All you did was pop a trunk.

09:45.410 --> 09:48.644
Listen, I'm all for female solidarity.

09:48.646 --> 09:51.580
If you want to call Triple
A and have a man come

09:51.582 --> 09:54.950
- and fix this tire, I won't tell.
- No, Cynthia,

09:54.952 --> 09:58.054
the whole point of feminism
is that we can do it ourselves.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.722
We are equals. We are women.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.590
Hear us roar!

10:02.526 --> 10:05.494
Don't you get tired of being you?

10:06.763 --> 10:10.866
Isn't it exhausting just
always trying to make a point?

10:10.868 --> 10:12.935
Always trying to prove things?

10:12.937 --> 10:16.806
Don't you want to just
bake cookies sometimes?

10:16.808 --> 10:18.641
No. I'm terrible at baking cookies.

10:18.643 --> 10:20.776
Yeah, I know that. I've
tasted your cookies.

10:20.778 --> 10:23.546
Well, maybe society shouldn't
force me to bake them,

10:23.548 --> 10:25.214
just because of my X chromosomes.

10:25.216 --> 10:29.151
Listen, don't blame your
DNA for your bad cookies.

10:29.153 --> 10:30.953
Look, Cynthia, it is
not about the cookies.

10:30.955 --> 10:33.422
It is about proving to Jerrod
that there are no such things

10:33.424 --> 10:34.957
as man jobs and woman jobs.

10:34.959 --> 10:36.158
There are just jobs.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.194
We can do anything they
can do, and vice versa.

10:38.196 --> 10:40.596
That is not true, Maxine.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.465
Men can't have babies,

10:42.467 --> 10:45.968
and women don't get prostate cancer.

10:45.970 --> 10:48.571
Prostate cancer's not a job.

10:48.573 --> 10:52.541
Well, it looks like a lot of work to me.

10:52.543 --> 10:55.344
Like what you're doing with this tire.

10:56.747 --> 10:59.014
You know something? You turning red.

11:00.183 --> 11:03.419
You're already two colors,
now you're adding a third.

11:03.421 --> 11:06.722
(groans) No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:06.724 --> 11:09.158
You, uh, you need some help over there?

11:09.160 --> 11:10.830
Why? Because I'm a woman

11:10.831 --> 11:12.394
you think I can't change this tire?

11:12.396 --> 11:13.956
No, I was just trying to be neighborly.

11:13.980 --> 11:15.212
Keep walking, oppressor.

11:21.772 --> 11:24.073
Careful, son. Take pride in what you do.

11:24.075 --> 11:25.241
No time for pride, Dad.

11:25.243 --> 11:26.563
I got to embarrass my girlfriend.

11:26.587 --> 11:27.543
Why-why...

11:27.545 --> 11:29.305
are there are so many
shingles on this thing?

11:29.329 --> 11:33.031
How come they-they can't
make just one big shingle?

11:33.517 --> 11:36.752
Ooh, man. Bobby's having a head rush.

11:36.754 --> 11:39.188
Altitude.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.468
Jerrod, I don't care about your contest.

11:52.470 --> 11:54.103
I care about this roof.

11:54.105 --> 11:56.572
You do realize this roof
is our last line of defense

11:56.574 --> 11:58.340
from all the dangers in the sky, like

11:58.342 --> 12:01.210
nuclear weapons, seagulls,

12:01.212 --> 12:04.346
rain, heavy rain, downpours.

12:04.348 --> 12:06.035
Okay, you ran out of things, didn't you?

12:06.036 --> 12:06.682
No, I didn't.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.517
Aggressive squirrels.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.886
Dad, this is taking way too long.

12:10.888 --> 12:13.222
What if Maxine actually
changes that tire?

12:13.224 --> 12:15.057
And then what if there's
like this Clinton-esque shift

12:15.059 --> 12:16.392
in power in our relationship.

12:16.394 --> 12:17.693
I can't be the Good Wife.

12:20.096 --> 12:21.664
Jerrod,

12:21.666 --> 12:24.300
are you trying to dig
through to the living room?

12:24.302 --> 12:25.668
'Cause the way you're moving,

12:25.670 --> 12:28.103
that's the only logical
conclusion I can jump to.

12:28.105 --> 12:29.405
Dad, just stop. Let me get it.

12:29.407 --> 12:30.940
No, just wait, wait, Jerrod, Jerrod.

12:30.942 --> 12:32.374
No, no, oh... ow!

12:32.376 --> 12:34.310
Oh, man, I didn't shove you that hard.

12:34.312 --> 12:36.779
I-I stepped on a nail.

12:36.781 --> 12:39.715
Well, I hope your
tetanus shot's up to date.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.551
Move your mouth like this
so you won't get lockjaw.

12:46.275 --> 12:48.423
(grunting) Come on.

12:49.539 --> 12:50.805
I cannot let Jerrod win,

12:50.806 --> 12:52.605
'cause I will never hear the end of it.

12:52.607 --> 12:54.367
With all that yoga
you've been talking about,

12:54.391 --> 12:58.211
I thought you had more
upper body strength.

12:58.213 --> 13:00.180
(sighs) God.

13:00.182 --> 13:01.915
What if we were on the
side of the road somewhere,

13:01.917 --> 13:03.283
and no one was around to help us?

13:03.285 --> 13:04.451
I wouldn't be there.

13:04.453 --> 13:06.352
If it was a road trip
with just you and me,

13:06.354 --> 13:08.955
I'd stay home.

13:08.957 --> 13:11.624
Can you at least help me?

13:11.626 --> 13:14.594
No, because this is crazy.

13:14.596 --> 13:18.465
Wasting a whole day watching
you try to prove something

13:18.467 --> 13:20.533
you don't even need to prove.

13:20.535 --> 13:22.669
It's not even worth a hundred dollars.

13:22.671 --> 13:26.339
I mean, I'm gonna keep it, though.

13:26.341 --> 13:28.208
What is this about, Maxine?

13:28.210 --> 13:31.444
You think Jerrod wants a-a girlfriend

13:31.446 --> 13:32.912
who can change a tire?

13:32.914 --> 13:35.615
I don't care what kind of
girlfriend Jerrod wants.

13:35.617 --> 13:38.852
Well, then, Maxine, what is this for?

13:38.854 --> 13:41.754
The world doesn't care if
you can't change a tire.

13:41.756 --> 13:44.157
And I know that you don't
have to change a tire

13:44.159 --> 13:45.458
before you go in to one of them

13:45.460 --> 13:49.062
feminist bra-burning meetings of yours.

13:49.064 --> 13:51.798
(groans) It's because no
one ever takes me seriously!

13:51.800 --> 13:53.800
Did you just stomp your foot?

13:54.902 --> 13:57.136
Well, that was adorable.

13:57.138 --> 13:58.304
Ugh, God.

13:58.306 --> 14:00.006
See?

14:00.008 --> 14:02.008
Everyone just thinks that
I'm cute and I'm nice.

14:02.010 --> 14:03.343
No one's scared of me.

14:03.345 --> 14:05.078
No one thinks I'm a formidable opponent.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.813
Any time I try to do
anything that requires

14:06.815 --> 14:07.914
any sort of strength,

14:07.916 --> 14:09.349
a man thinks that I need his help,

14:09.351 --> 14:10.517
but I don't.

14:10.519 --> 14:11.651
Maxine.

14:11.653 --> 14:13.653
I do not think you are helpless.

14:13.655 --> 14:17.357
In fact, I think you are
one of the most bull-headed,

14:17.359 --> 14:19.559
aggravating people I have ever met.

14:19.561 --> 14:22.195
When you find a bone to pick,

14:22.197 --> 14:23.863
you just won't let it go.

14:23.865 --> 14:25.765
And even when you win the argument,

14:25.767 --> 14:28.134
you're still just picking at it.

14:28.136 --> 14:29.869
Really?

14:29.871 --> 14:31.237
Thank you, Cynthia.

14:31.239 --> 14:32.972
That is not a compliment.

14:32.974 --> 14:34.474
You should be offended

14:34.476 --> 14:36.709
by what I just said to you,

14:36.711 --> 14:39.479
and honestly, I think this is

14:39.481 --> 14:42.549
what's going to break up you and my son.

14:42.551 --> 14:44.417
What? My belief that a woman can be

14:44.419 --> 14:46.119
more than a wife and a mother?

14:46.121 --> 14:49.756
Oh, well, excuse me, Ms. 28-year-old,

14:49.758 --> 14:52.792
"I think I can change a
tire to prove I'm equal."

14:52.794 --> 14:55.295
True feminism is when a woman knows

14:55.297 --> 14:58.131
where she wants to be in the world.

14:58.133 --> 14:59.666
Now, if you want to join the Army,

14:59.668 --> 15:02.201
and get trench foot, you go for it.

15:02.203 --> 15:04.170
But if I want to be in my kitchen,

15:04.172 --> 15:06.072
baking cookies for my family,

15:06.074 --> 15:07.907
then you can't say boo to me,

15:07.909 --> 15:09.609
because I have burned

15:09.611 --> 15:12.245
bigger bras than you will ever wear.

15:16.617 --> 15:18.151
My boobs are bigger than you think!

15:18.153 --> 15:20.153
That wasn't meant for you.

15:21.889 --> 15:23.556
Ah, Dad, this really hurts.

15:23.558 --> 15:25.525
Who steps on a nail, Jerrod?

15:25.527 --> 15:27.193
You know how many
nails I got in my body?

15:27.195 --> 15:30.363
None. 'Cause I got gravy
and Wendy's double stacks

15:30.365 --> 15:32.665
pushing back against them.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.434
Now, Dad, I don't want to kick Jerrod

15:34.436 --> 15:35.602
when he's down,

15:35.604 --> 15:36.964
but I just want to make the point,

15:36.988 --> 15:40.173
that Bobby Carmichael didn't
step on any nails today.

15:40.175 --> 15:43.142
I got one son drinking
juice out of a pouch,

15:43.144 --> 15:44.711
and another son whining

15:44.713 --> 15:46.512
about this little nail in his foot.

15:46.514 --> 15:48.748
I-I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.016
A-actually, you know what?

15:50.018 --> 15:51.250
It's all your fault.

15:51.252 --> 15:53.753
You raised us to be men for a world

15:53.755 --> 15:55.588
that doesn't exist anymore.

15:55.590 --> 15:58.424
Jerrod, a man is a
man in whatever world.

15:58.426 --> 16:00.560
No, Dad. You know you
taught us how to, like,

16:00.562 --> 16:03.062
re-shingle roofs, and change tires,

16:03.064 --> 16:04.864
and check out other women

16:04.866 --> 16:07.333
while our wives don't notice, but...

16:07.335 --> 16:08.568
you basically

16:08.570 --> 16:11.304
showed us how to be the
greatest men of 1972,

16:11.306 --> 16:13.806
but that's not the
point anymore, you know.

16:13.808 --> 16:15.408
I-it's not what defines you as a man...

16:15.410 --> 16:16.909
strength and fixing things.

16:16.911 --> 16:18.111
Yeah, that's right, Dad.

16:18.113 --> 16:19.379
Women don't care about muscles

16:19.381 --> 16:20.680
and tool belts no more.

16:20.682 --> 16:22.048
Look, I got a friend
named Clayton, right.

16:22.050 --> 16:23.583
He's frail and he play the ukulele.

16:23.585 --> 16:24.817
This dude has banged

16:24.819 --> 16:26.386
more women than Wilt Chamberlin.

16:26.388 --> 16:28.688
Yeah, that's true, Dad.

16:28.690 --> 16:30.056
Like, when you were a
kid, if you saw a dude

16:30.058 --> 16:31.791
with, like, a thick
beard, and a flannel shirt,

16:31.793 --> 16:33.159
you'd think he was a lumberjack.

16:33.161 --> 16:34.627
Now that dude sells organic juice,

16:34.629 --> 16:35.862
and he doesn't climax

16:35.864 --> 16:39.198
until he's sure his girlfriend has.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.400
Why would he do that?

16:40.402 --> 16:42.235
Daddy, 'cause it's all mixed up, man.

16:42.237 --> 16:43.670
Like, for instance, I
went on a date, right.

16:43.672 --> 16:44.871
And this girl just wanted me

16:44.873 --> 16:46.153
to be a man in public, you know.

16:46.177 --> 16:48.341
She had me opening
doors, and buying dinner.

16:48.343 --> 16:51.077
And then when we got
home, she took control.

16:51.079 --> 16:52.779
Yeah, she did things to me in bed,

16:52.781 --> 16:55.081
I've been trying to block
out of my head for years.

16:56.884 --> 16:59.752
Son? Never block out your sex memories.

16:59.754 --> 17:02.755
You're going to need them one day.

17:02.757 --> 17:05.023
You know, I just got to accept I'm not

17:05.026 --> 17:06.659
a man in the traditional way

17:06.661 --> 17:08.161
you're supposed to be a man.

17:08.163 --> 17:09.228
I'm the type of man

17:09.230 --> 17:10.963
who needs a man around the house.

17:12.700 --> 17:15.568
The other day, I was
trying to make dinner,

17:15.569 --> 17:17.336
and I couldn't open a jar, you know.

17:17.338 --> 17:18.503
You know what I did?

17:18.506 --> 17:20.973
I ate something else.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.911
- You ate something else?
- Yeah.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.212
Son, you got to break the jar.

17:26.214 --> 17:28.314
- Eat glass if you have to.
- No.

17:28.316 --> 17:31.150
No, Dad. I'm not that
type of guy, you know.

17:31.152 --> 17:32.852
And I'm not dating that type of girl.

17:32.854 --> 17:34.187
I'm in love with a woman

17:34.189 --> 17:35.588
that wanted to change a tire,

17:35.590 --> 17:36.856
and I stopped her,

17:36.858 --> 17:38.618
because I was afraid
of what you would think,

17:38.619 --> 17:39.619
and what Mom would think.

17:39.643 --> 17:41.294
But I can't think of one good reason

17:41.296 --> 17:43.096
why she shouldn't change that tire.

17:43.098 --> 17:44.764
Well, I can.

17:44.766 --> 17:46.933
You know, what if she
slips and-and falls,

17:46.935 --> 17:49.836
and cuts her face on the tire iron?

17:49.838 --> 17:51.804
Now you're dating Seal.

17:54.808 --> 17:57.110
You want to date Seal, Jerrod, huh?

17:57.112 --> 17:59.712
I didn't think so.

17:59.714 --> 18:01.674
So you mean, seriously,
you're going to sit there,

18:01.698 --> 18:03.449
and watch your girlfriend
change the tire?

18:03.451 --> 18:05.218
No, no, no. I wouldn't watch her do it.

18:05.220 --> 18:07.320
I'd go in the house and
watch <i>Property Brothers.</i>

18:07.322 --> 18:09.522
Uh, let me ask you something, son.

18:09.524 --> 18:11.390
Did I fail you, or
did you fail yourself?

18:11.392 --> 18:14.093
No, Dad. No one failed anyone.

18:14.095 --> 18:16.629
I just don't want to be
told what to do as a man,

18:16.631 --> 18:17.897
and I can't tell my girlfriend

18:17.899 --> 18:19.332
what to do as a woman.

18:19.334 --> 18:22.268
Well, I guess I have to accept you as a

18:22.270 --> 18:23.736
gender-neutral, 21st century

18:23.738 --> 18:25.071
creature that you are.

18:25.073 --> 18:27.707
Okay, no one said anything
about gender-neutral.

18:27.709 --> 18:29.041
I'm just evolved.

18:29.043 --> 18:31.244
No. You can use any restroom

18:31.246 --> 18:32.812
that you feel fits you.

18:32.814 --> 18:33.946
Matter of fact, I'm not even

18:33.948 --> 18:35.314
going to call you "he" or "she",

18:35.316 --> 18:37.183
from here on out, I'm
going to call you "Thou".

18:38.852 --> 18:40.987
All right, no one's transgender, Dad.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.722
I just don't want to fix this roof.

18:42.724 --> 18:46.292
Well, Thou can do
whatever Thou wants to do.

18:46.294 --> 18:47.493
Daddy, that was beautiful.

18:47.495 --> 18:48.861
- Thank you, son.
- No, no, stop.

18:48.863 --> 18:50.983
I'm going to go down here.
I'm going to call a roofer.

18:50.985 --> 18:52.485
Well, I hope it's not
going to be a woman roofer.

18:52.487 --> 18:54.767
I don't mean to be sexist,
but if the police find

18:54.769 --> 18:56.409
a woman on my roof,
they're going to think

18:56.411 --> 18:57.577
she escaped from the basement

18:57.579 --> 19:00.039
after 20 years of imprisonment.

19:03.944 --> 19:05.211
(sighs)

19:08.315 --> 19:10.716
Hey.

19:10.718 --> 19:12.985
Ha. I did it.

19:12.987 --> 19:14.520
Screw you, Jerrod.

19:14.522 --> 19:17.557
Oh, roses.

19:17.559 --> 19:19.392
Maxine, I'm not a roofer.

19:19.394 --> 19:20.693
So you guys didn't finish?

19:20.695 --> 19:22.061
Nah. Not even close.

19:22.063 --> 19:24.063
In fact, I think it's
worse than when we started.

19:24.065 --> 19:25.565
But you're right, Maxine.

19:25.567 --> 19:27.900
You can do anything that I can do.

19:27.902 --> 19:29.302
Thank you.

19:30.304 --> 19:31.470
But I-I mean that.

19:31.472 --> 19:32.238
Like, from now on, you're going to do

19:32.240 --> 19:33.306
all the things that I do.

19:33.308 --> 19:34.748
You're going to change all the tires,

19:34.750 --> 19:35.882
you're going to take out the garbage,

19:35.884 --> 19:37.310
you're going to kill all the bugs,

19:37.312 --> 19:39.312
uh, I think that's pretty
much the end of the list.

19:39.314 --> 19:40.314
Yeah, you don't do a lot.

19:40.338 --> 19:41.180
I know.

19:41.182 --> 19:43.182
I should do more, but...

19:43.184 --> 19:44.483
Hey, what happened here?

19:44.485 --> 19:46.853
Oh, uh, yeah, I slipped
on the tire iron,

19:46.855 --> 19:48.054
and scratched myself.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.176
Oh, my God, Bobby was right.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.824
Let me see your face.

19:51.826 --> 19:55.528
Whew. God, we dodged the Seal bullet.

19:55.530 --> 19:57.463
What... what is a Seal bullet?

19:57.465 --> 19:58.945
That's where a bullet hits your face,

19:58.969 --> 20:01.269
and you end up looking like Seal.

20:02.864 --> 20:06.023
- Why is there so much junk up here?
- Oh, no, Maxine, I went

20:06.024 --> 20:08.064
through a phase where I
thought I could throw things

20:08.088 --> 20:10.891
over the house... I couldn't.

20:10.893 --> 20:12.533
JOE: Said it once and
I will say it again,

20:12.557 --> 20:14.361
it's fun being up on the roof,

20:14.363 --> 20:17.497
if you're not waiting for FEMA.

20:17.499 --> 20:19.333
Well, me and Maxine,

20:19.335 --> 20:21.101
we couldn't have done a better job.

20:21.103 --> 20:24.171
You should have seen the
way we changed that tire.

20:25.039 --> 20:26.740
Oh, we changed that tire?

20:26.742 --> 20:28.775
Oh! Look!

20:28.777 --> 20:32.646
Is that a naked girl over there?

20:32.648 --> 20:33.880
Where?

20:33.882 --> 20:37.884
(calling): Denise! We can see you, girl.

20:39.420 --> 20:41.988
Put some clothes on!

20:41.990 --> 20:44.524
No, don't stand!

20:44.526 --> 20:46.793
Squatting is worse!

20:46.795 --> 20:54.255
