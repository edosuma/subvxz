12:07.928 --> 12:10.797
Balki, we haven't been robbed.

12:10.831 --> 12:11.932
I took the television.

12:11.965 --> 12:16.202
Oh, you took the television.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.470
You took the television?

12:18.805 --> 12:19.940
Balki, I've given this
a lot of thought

12:19.973 --> 12:21.842
and what I've done
is for your own good.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.844
You've been watching
too much television lately

12:23.877 --> 12:26.079
and you've just got to stop.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.782
Let me get this straight.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.285
You're telling me that

12:32.318 --> 12:34.120
I can't watch television.

12:34.154 --> 12:37.090
‐ Yes.
‐ Yes, I see, and...

12:39.059 --> 12:40.393
I'm telling you

12:41.261 --> 12:44.264
give me the TV.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.503
It's not here.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.171
It's in a locker
at the bus station.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.540
Oh, I see.

12:53.574 --> 12:56.476
It's in a locker
at the bus station.

12:58.512 --> 13:01.815
Give me the key.

13:03.349 --> 13:04.851
I haven't got it.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.953
I gave it to Jennifer
and Mary Anne.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.391
They're on a flight to Zurich.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.233
What is this?
Some kind of sick joke?

13:21.902 --> 13:23.937
Balki, ever since we got cable

13:23.970 --> 13:25.939
you spend all night watching TV

13:25.972 --> 13:27.608
and eating junk food.

13:27.641 --> 13:30.476
Do you know it's been two weeks
since you've eaten with a fork.

13:30.511 --> 13:31.878
Now, what kind of life is that?

13:31.912 --> 13:32.913
It's a wonderful life.

13:32.946 --> 13:33.914
Now, cousin...

13:35.215 --> 13:37.083
Cousin, if that's
all that's bothering you

13:37.117 --> 13:39.285
just sit down,
listen to this.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.322
I can stop watching TV
anytime I want to.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.624
You can stop anytime?

13:43.657 --> 13:46.326
‐ You have to ask?
‐ Yes.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.828
What was the question?

13:49.095 --> 13:51.297
You can stop watching TV
anytime you want to?

13:51.331 --> 13:53.366
‐ Of course, I can.
‐ Then do it.

13:53.399 --> 13:54.167
‐ Do what?
‐ Stop.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.336
‐ Stop what?
‐ Stop watching TV.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.470
‐ When?
‐ Tonight.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.471
‐ Tonight?
‐ Tonight.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.107
‐ Who?
‐ You! Tonight!

14:01.141 --> 14:04.511
Stop watching TV, tonight!

14:10.450 --> 14:11.952
Well, alright.

14:13.253 --> 14:14.988
There's no need to get crazy.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.457
We don't have a television.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.093
I'll have to do without,
won't I?

14:20.126 --> 14:21.194
Goodness gracious.

14:21.227 --> 14:23.096
Great balls of fire.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.935
So that's it?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.338
You're not going to watch
any more television?

14:32.372 --> 14:33.874
What did I just say?

14:36.376 --> 14:37.377
Good.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.013
Well, I'd like to stay here
with you

14:40.046 --> 14:42.482
but I have to go.

14:42.516 --> 14:44.284
Mr. Flynn wants me
to cover the hearing

14:44.317 --> 14:45.519
at the Water Commission.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.523
‐ You'll be alright?
‐ Well, I'll be fine.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.992
I'll just sit here
and read this book.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.530
Okay.

14:59.365 --> 15:00.534
‐ See you later?
‐ See you later.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.536
I'll just be sitting here...

Where did you get that?

Crazy Al's video.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.160
Alright, well, this has gotten
completely out of hand.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.128
We have to take this back.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.566
I don't think so.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.054
Give me the remote.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.056
Get your own remote.

Oh, look, there's Gumby.

Oh!

You tricked Balki.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.600
You're damn right
I tricked Balki.

16:39.633 --> 16:41.668
Give me my remote!

16:42.769 --> 16:43.704
Balki!

16:44.771 --> 16:47.741
You've got to stop watching
so much television.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.076
I don't want to see you

No way, Rosay.

And do you know why?

17:02.288 --> 17:06.159
Because I have no idea
what that is.

17:08.094 --> 17:10.496
Now give me my remote!

17:13.366 --> 17:14.467
A couch potato is someone

who is addicted to television.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.805
They sit on the couch

They lose interest
in everything else.

Is that a TV in the window

I was watching "Sea Hunt".

18:43.557 --> 18:45.826

Well, believe it.
It's gone.

to mention this

19:47.854 --> 19:49.590

it would be too painful.

But you give me no choice.

It was over two weeks ago.

Well, that can't be.

20:11.812 --> 20:13.246
It was‐it was right after

‐ Wednesday.

is only bad if you abuse it.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.847

is learn to be more selective

21:20.881 --> 21:22.683
about what you watch.

21:22.716 --> 21:23.483
Do you think I could that?

21:23.517 --> 21:26.553
Of course you can,
I'll help you.

21:26.587 --> 21:27.954
Oh, thank you, cousin.

21:27.988 --> 21:29.590
Now, first thing in the morning

21:29.623 --> 21:30.791
we'll go see Crazy Al

21:30.824 --> 21:32.325
and return this TV.

21:32.358 --> 21:33.560
That's a good idea.

cancel that satellite dish
I ordered.

the postage meter refilled?

22:15.401 --> 22:17.103
Yes, sir, and I put
the receipit on your desk.

‐ Receipit?
‐ Receipit.

22:20.406 --> 22:21.708
Did you copy all those invoices?

22:21.742 --> 22:25.011
Yes sir, and I made
copies of the copies.

22:25.045 --> 22:27.113

those mail bags washed?

22:27.147 --> 22:29.716
Oh, c'mon, you weren't serious
about that, were you?

22:29.750 --> 22:33.687

I got them washed and ironed

half on hangers.

going to go see tonight?
