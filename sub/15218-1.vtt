00:39.419 --> 00:42.445
You know what I would love to do?

00:45.425 --> 00:51.057
I would love to... fix that flat for you,
but I can't. I mean...

00:51.131 --> 00:54.362
It's your only tux,
and you're late for your wedding.

00:54.434 --> 00:57.460
How could I be late?
We've just met.

01:01.408 --> 01:03.933
I'm a lot friendlier than he is.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.105
That's what I'm afraid of.

01:13.220 --> 01:14.710
Wow!

01:14.788 --> 01:16.983
Kick in the butt, ain't it?

01:17.057 --> 01:19.048
I never felt anything like it.

01:20.060 --> 01:21.960
Ooh, who makes this?

01:23.063 --> 01:26.897
Oh, this?
This is an experimental model.

01:28.902 --> 01:30.893
Look at that.

01:35.308 --> 01:39.608
- Oh, that's, uh, sheet lightning.
- I never saw lightning like that before.

01:39.679 --> 01:42.079
And there are no clouds.
I can see the stars.

01:44.484 --> 01:47.510
You know, that's about where they
set off the first atomic bomb.

01:47.587 --> 01:51.182
No kidding.

01:51.258 --> 01:54.591
And some people say there's
still a top secret project out there.

01:54.661 --> 01:57.824
Something to do with
the deep space probe or a...

01:57.898 --> 02:00.765
- Control!
- What's happening, Gooshie?

02:00.834 --> 02:05.134
He's leaping.
Ziggy said no, but Sam's leaping.

02:05.205 --> 02:08.834
- He can't leap. We're not ready.
- Tell Sam that!

02:08.908 --> 02:13.312
- Put him on!
- I can't. He's in the accelerator.

02:22.422 --> 02:25.687
Al-Al, what do I do?

02:25.759 --> 02:27.989
Nothing. Any interference
could kill him.

02:28.061 --> 02:30.052
I'll be there in two minutes.

02:30.130 --> 02:32.724
Hang on, beautiful.

04:13.934 --> 04:15.959
We did it.

04:16.036 --> 04:19.164
Did what?

04:20.640 --> 04:23.768
I can't remember.

04:23.843 --> 04:26.437
I can't remember anything.

04:26.513 --> 04:28.777
Who am I?

04:29.783 --> 04:31.774
Where am I?

04:36.723 --> 04:40.318
I'll put the coffee on, Tom.

04:40.393 --> 04:43.328
Oh, boy.

04:43.396 --> 04:45.387
I'm in big trouble here.

04:45.465 --> 04:48.161
I don't even remember going to bed
with this woman, whoever she is.

04:48.234 --> 04:52.136
And whoever she is,
she's certainly... pregnant.

04:53.740 --> 04:55.674
Very pregnant.

04:55.742 --> 04:57.733
Good morning.

05:04.117 --> 05:07.712
What will I be you okay?

05:07.787 --> 05:10.688
<i>The secretary of state
appeared to be acting as a go-between... </i>

05:10.757 --> 05:14.124
<i>at the United Nations in an effort to
cool down the heightened tensions between... </i>

05:14.194 --> 05:16.754
Tom, better hurry up.

05:16.830 --> 05:19.697
Bird Dog's gonna be here to pick you up
in about 10 minutes.

05:19.766 --> 05:22.064
Oh, honey, the P.X. was out
of your shaving cream,

05:22.135 --> 05:24.467
so I got you some of that stuff, uh...

05:24.537 --> 05:27.973
What do you call it? The one with
the cute little signs on the highway.

05:30.043 --> 05:32.341
"Burma Shave?"
Oh, that's it.

05:32.412 --> 05:35.677
Burma Shave.
I love those little signs.

05:36.750 --> 05:40.652
What's taking you so long?
You gotta hurry up. Come on.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.711
Get in there.

05:46.826 --> 05:50.057
Oh, Tom. Sometimes...

05:53.967 --> 05:56.128
It's a dream.

05:56.202 --> 05:58.898
That's it. I'm dreaming.

05:58.972 --> 06:01.907
All I have to do is flow with it,
and I'll wake up.

06:03.476 --> 06:05.410
Shave.

06:05.478 --> 06:08.379
The sooner you shave,
the sooner you'll wake up.

06:11.918 --> 06:13.909
Oh, God.

06:14.921 --> 06:17.446
It smells real.

06:17.524 --> 06:19.992
It feels real.

06:20.060 --> 06:22.221
What the hell is happening?

06:33.673 --> 06:36.267
Tom?

06:36.342 --> 06:39.971
Honey, what's wrong? Who
do you see in the mirror?

06:40.046 --> 06:43.209
Oh, Tom, would you cut it out?
You nearly scared me into delivering.

06:43.283 --> 06:45.444
Who do you see in the mirror?
You.

06:48.054 --> 06:50.215
- Me?
- And me.

06:50.290 --> 06:52.053
Oh.

06:52.125 --> 06:54.252
Oh, I look awful.

06:54.327 --> 06:57.125
Most women bloom
when they get pregnant. I shrivel.

06:57.197 --> 06:59.131
Tom, I look like a prune.

06:59.199 --> 07:01.827
My name's not Tom.

07:01.901 --> 07:04.199
Honey, you're supposed to say,
"Peg, I love prunes. "

07:04.270 --> 07:08.570
- What do you mean your name's not Tom?
- Daddy, Captain Birdell's on the phone.

07:11.211 --> 07:15.580
- I'm a daddy.
- Tom, are you sick?

07:16.649 --> 07:19.516
Oh, honey, you're not gonna fly
if you're sick, are you?

07:23.256 --> 07:25.247
Fly?

07:26.526 --> 07:30.189
Mikey, tell Captain Birdell that Daddy will
call him as soon as he gets out of the shower.

07:30.263 --> 07:34.165
Roger. And get his number. You know
him. He never sleeps at the B.O.Q

07:35.635 --> 07:38.160
555-2231.

07:38.238 --> 07:40.832
Daddy's in the shower.
What's your number?

07:49.649 --> 07:52.777
5-5-5

07:55.922 --> 07:58.686
Tom, what are you up to?
I'm calling my office.

07:58.758 --> 08:02.524
- But that's Block field 8-4-7.
- What the hell's wrong with the phone?

08:02.595 --> 08:04.961
You're dialing too many numbers.

08:05.031 --> 08:08.228
Too many? Maybe not enough.
What's the area code?

08:08.301 --> 08:12.362
Area code? You never tell us
codes, Dad. That's secret stuff.

08:12.438 --> 08:14.463
Secret? What the hell
is secret about an area code?

08:14.541 --> 08:18.409
If you're testing one of your gags on us,
I don't have time for it and neither do you.

08:18.478 --> 08:20.878
<i>That's the morning report on KHOl. </i>

08:20.947 --> 08:23.177
<i>Stay tuned for all the denizens
of Doodyville... </i>

08:23.249 --> 08:26.013
<i>with Buffalo Bob and Howdy Doody. </i>

08:27.153 --> 08:30.384
<i>Well, Howdy Doody, kids. </i>

08:30.456 --> 08:34.017
<i>- And howdy, Buffalo Bob.
- Howdy there, Mr. Doody. </i>

08:34.092 --> 08:37.995
<i>Boys and girls at home and all
our kids here in the gallery, let's go!</i>

08:38.063 --> 08:44.070
<i>It's Howdy Doody time</i>

08:45.839 --> 08:48.569
<i>Bob Smith and Howdy too</i>

08:48.641 --> 08:51.701
<i>Wave howdy-do to you</i>

09:15.635 --> 09:17.569
Okay.

09:17.637 --> 09:19.571
It's not a dream.

09:19.639 --> 09:21.800
It's a nightmare.

09:21.875 --> 09:24.400
And if it's a nightmare,
sooner or later,

09:25.411 --> 09:27.743
there's gonna be a bogeyman.

09:30.583 --> 09:35.043
Until the bogeyman showed up,
I decided to ride out the dream.

09:35.121 --> 09:37.521
Not that I had a choice.

09:37.590 --> 09:39.820
Everyone seemed to think it was 1956,

09:39.893 --> 09:42.020
and that I was an air force
captain named Tom Stratton...

09:42.095 --> 09:46.156
with a wife called Peg
and one and two-thirds children.

09:46.232 --> 09:48.792
Evidently, my best friend
was the officer behind the wheel,

09:48.868 --> 09:51.803
a Captain Birdell, who
everyone simply called Bird Dog.

09:52.939 --> 09:55.237
It didn't take long to find out why.

09:56.676 --> 09:59.236
Hey. Hey-hey-hey, hoo-hoo.

09:59.312 --> 10:02.406
Look at this.

10:08.855 --> 10:11.585
Oh, my.
And I don't see a wedding ring.

10:13.793 --> 10:16.261
Good morning, sweet pea.
How are you?

10:17.597 --> 10:19.758
Allow me to introduce myself.

10:19.832 --> 10:22.426
I'm Captain Bill Birdell and...

10:22.502 --> 10:25.471
well, my facially wounded friend
here is Captain Tom Stratton.

10:27.006 --> 10:29.600
You might've heard of us.
We're the only two pilots...

10:29.676 --> 10:32.668
in the entire United States Air Force
brave enough to fly the X-2.

10:32.745 --> 10:34.872
Oh?

10:34.948 --> 10:39.044
What about Tony LaMott?
Oh, Lord.

10:39.118 --> 10:41.609
Don't tell me you've been led astray
by that junior birdman.

10:41.688 --> 10:44.521
Captain LaMott might have
a complicated wristwatch,

10:44.590 --> 10:48.993
but he ain't anywhere close
to being otherwise test pilot equipped.

10:49.062 --> 10:50.996
This being Friday,
I assume you're...

10:51.064 --> 10:52.998
staying at the ranch
as his weekend guest?

10:53.066 --> 10:57.332
Well, I'm staying at the ranch.
Then I'll anticipate a dance tonight.

10:57.403 --> 11:01.669
And the sonic booms you hear today
will be dedicated to you.

11:25.231 --> 11:28.758
"Only two guys brave
enough to fly the X-2."

11:28.835 --> 11:31.463
You gotta impress the ladies,
pard, if you wanna score.

11:31.537 --> 11:33.903
Besides that, it's true.

11:33.973 --> 11:36.168
What if I told you I couldn't fly?

11:36.242 --> 11:39.370
You sick?
No, I just...

11:39.445 --> 11:43.643
When I woke up this morning,
.. couldn't remember how to fly.

11:45.485 --> 11:48.648
I like it.
It's so crazy, I like it.

11:48.721 --> 11:51.212
Who you gonna pull it on?
It's not a joke.

11:51.290 --> 11:54.487
You sound like you mean it.
I do.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.997
Damn, Tom, that's what makes you
the best, that sincere look.

11:59.065 --> 12:03.434
Hell, if I could lie with a straight face
like you, my bird-dogging rate would double.

12:03.503 --> 12:07.166
Hey, what say
we pull it on Weird Ernie.

12:08.708 --> 12:12.075
Weird Ernie? Yeah, we'll tell him
that flying faster than Mach 2...

12:12.145 --> 12:14.113
is affecting our minds.

12:14.180 --> 12:16.114
Affecting your minds how?

12:16.182 --> 12:18.673
It seems the faster I fly,
the less I remember about it.

12:18.751 --> 12:23.313
I've experienced that. And I'm starting
to forget things, like my wife's birthday.

12:23.389 --> 12:26.790
I never forgot Lucy's birthday
until I flew at Mach 2.5.

12:26.859 --> 12:29.487
Last time I busted Mach 2,
I forgot where I parked my car.

12:29.562 --> 12:31.553
That's fascinating.

12:31.631 --> 12:34.725
Dr. Berger, could you design a test to
quantify these apparent memory losses?

12:35.802 --> 12:40.967
- I should be able to come up with something.
- Good. Good.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.838
This is a most interesting development.
Thank you, gentlemen.

12:43.910 --> 12:47.004
Before we mount up, there's one more thing.
We believe the fire warning light...

12:47.080 --> 12:50.140
Captain Birdell encountered at Mach 2.6
was a result of inadequate insulation.

12:50.216 --> 12:53.310
We've rewired the system,
and we expect no further problems.

12:53.386 --> 12:56.014
What's all this "we" stuff?
You gonna be up there with me?

12:56.089 --> 12:59.252
I wish I could, Captain LaMott.
I truly wish I could.

12:59.325 --> 13:03.591
But as you know, my war wounds
physically disqualify me.

13:03.663 --> 13:07.121
If you should experience
a red light around Mach 2.6,

13:07.200 --> 13:10.101
shut down until the chase plane
can catch up and check you over...

13:10.169 --> 13:12.137
for visible signs of fire.

13:12.205 --> 13:14.196
A fella could
be barbecued doing that.

13:14.273 --> 13:16.833
You get a fire warning light, Tony,
I recommend you punch out.

13:16.909 --> 13:21.278
- You didn't eject.
- Yeah, but I'm a damn hero.

13:21.347 --> 13:23.611
You know, I like that guy.

13:23.683 --> 13:26.208
He kind of reminds me of me
back in the old days.

13:26.285 --> 13:29.812
All right, all right. If there are no
further questions, gentlemen, let's mount up.

13:36.362 --> 13:38.728
Well, he swallowed that
hook, line and slide rule.

13:41.934 --> 13:44.334
Now, ain't this a kick in the butt?

13:56.849 --> 14:02.385
Chase One, hold on niner east.

14:07.994 --> 14:09.928
Mother Hen, you are cleared to roll.

14:09.996 --> 14:12.590
The pattern is yours.
Good luck.

14:16.836 --> 14:19.236
You're my best friends.
I need your honest opinion here.

14:19.305 --> 14:22.240
Uh-oh. Which thigh
has less stretch marks?

14:22.308 --> 14:25.106
Oh, Lord.
My right one. Okay?

14:25.178 --> 14:28.375
Or my left?
Gosh, Peg.

14:28.447 --> 14:30.881
You know, I think this
one has less. My right?

14:30.950 --> 14:33.043
They're not as wide either.
Really?

14:33.119 --> 14:34.950
This is the one I'm using
my cactus cream on.

14:35.021 --> 14:36.352
No!
Yes!

15:04.016 --> 15:07.816
I gotta stop drinking so much coffee.
It's making me jumpy.

15:07.887 --> 15:10.412
Yeah.

15:16.495 --> 15:19.464
Given enough time,
you can get used to anything,

15:19.532 --> 15:22.262
even a nightmare.

15:23.569 --> 15:27.198
All you have to do is relax and...

15:27.273 --> 15:29.264
trust those around you.

15:33.145 --> 15:35.079
When did you get
into the import business?

15:35.147 --> 15:37.615
What are you talking about?
That long-legged honey...

15:37.683 --> 15:39.776
staying at the ranch
this weekend.

15:39.852 --> 15:42.184
What's he do, Tom,
smell 'em out?

15:42.255 --> 15:44.450
It's a natural gift, son.
It's a natural gift.

15:44.523 --> 15:46.457
Sort of like
a bird dog flushing quail.

15:46.525 --> 15:48.993
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I gotta mount up.

16:02.141 --> 16:05.110
You know, I'm actually
beginning to enjoy this.

16:05.177 --> 16:10.274
I mean, here I am, a daring air force
test pilot who doesn't have to fly.

16:10.349 --> 16:12.317
Well, she's all yours, pard.

16:13.786 --> 16:16.721
Take her up to 25 while
I answer Mother Nature.

16:45.584 --> 16:49.076
Mother Hen heading 2-5-0-2-6-0...

16:49.155 --> 16:51.680
at 12,000 and dropping.

16:51.757 --> 16:55.352
Mother Hen, Edwards. Radar indicates you are
in a 40-degree-per-minute turn to the right.

16:55.428 --> 16:57.828
Are you experiencing a problem?
Over.

17:02.101 --> 17:08.061
Whoa-ooo-ooo!

17:09.642 --> 17:12.702
- What's wrong?
- I can't fly.

17:12.778 --> 17:16.771
Bird Dog, Tom,
can you read me? Over.

17:22.922 --> 17:25.049
Mother Hen, Edwards.
Do you have a problem? Over.

17:26.125 --> 17:28.093
Uh, Edwards, this is Mother Hen.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.094
We must've had a bubble
in the hydraulic system,

17:30.162 --> 17:33.131
'cause for a while, this bird
was flying like a Mack truck.

17:33.199 --> 17:35.190
Whatever it was,
we must have burped it out.

17:35.267 --> 17:38.532
We are continuing our climb
up to 25,000.

17:40.172 --> 17:43.801
You save it for Weird Ernie, pard.
You ain't never gonna sucker me.

17:47.146 --> 17:49.137
Just don't ask me to fly.

18:22.181 --> 18:25.514
<i>Edwards, Mother Hen.
Level at 25,000.</i>

18:25.584 --> 18:27.848
Roger, Mother Hen.
You are clear to drop.

18:30.189 --> 18:32.180
Good luck.

18:43.102 --> 18:45.969
Hey, Tony, I'm tired of
hauling your butt around.

18:46.038 --> 18:50.270
I'm gonna cut you loose and see which
of us gets back to that blonde first.

18:57.850 --> 19:01.286
Is everybody back there
okay where they're at?

19:03.756 --> 19:06.122
Yeah, looks fine to me.

19:07.426 --> 19:12.329
All right. 240 indicated.
Here we go, ladies.

19:13.566 --> 19:17.195
Drop in ten, nine, eight,

19:17.269 --> 19:19.703
seven, six,

19:19.772 --> 19:21.672
five, four,

19:22.741 --> 19:24.709
three, two,

19:24.777 --> 19:26.472
one.

19:26.545 --> 19:28.172
Bombs away.

19:53.005 --> 19:55.439
Ride her, cowboy.

20:05.784 --> 20:09.618
Mach 1.3 and accelerating.

20:10.623 --> 20:12.284
Nosing over.

20:14.493 --> 20:18.020
One-nine. Mach 2.

20:19.265 --> 20:22.063
All right.
She's leveling off.

20:22.134 --> 20:25.069
65,000.

20:25.137 --> 20:27.298
Sixty-six.

20:27.373 --> 20:30.536
Level at 71,000.

20:30.609 --> 20:33.305
Mach 2.4.

20:35.147 --> 20:37.138
On profile.

20:39.485 --> 20:43.251
All right. Starting my run.
Firing rocket three.

20:43.322 --> 20:46.553
Mach 2.5.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.460
Two-six.

20:53.399 --> 20:57.392
Outside skin temperature. 683.

20:57.469 --> 20:59.596
Ain't no fire warning light.

20:59.672 --> 21:02.266
I guess we beat that gremlin.

21:03.909 --> 21:05.843
Mach 2.7.

21:06.979 --> 21:10.847
Two-eight.

21:14.887 --> 21:17.981
Skin temperature. 800.

21:20.492 --> 21:22.619
Fire warning light.

21:23.662 --> 21:26.290
Rockets off.

21:32.771 --> 21:35.296
Everything looks okay.
Mach 2.4.

21:35.374 --> 21:37.035
2.3.

21:38.043 --> 21:40.341
Nah, I think it's
another false alarm.

21:40.412 --> 21:44.610
- Hey, where are you, Dougie?
- Five miles behind you at 30,000.

21:44.683 --> 21:47.345
Roger. Coming back to you
for a look-see.

21:48.187 --> 21:51.281
Don't turn above Mach 2.
Don't turn above Mach 2.

21:51.357 --> 21:53.518
Oh, I lost her!

22:33.732 --> 22:35.723
Did you see it?

22:38.404 --> 22:40.395
There.

22:42.574 --> 22:44.565
Oh, God.

23:22.147 --> 23:24.809
Well, the X-2 didn't get him,
but she's sure gonna auger him in.

23:24.883 --> 23:30.549
- You think so?
- Yeah, he's got that, uh, that sick calf look.

23:30.622 --> 23:33.853
Here we go, gang.
Bird Dog's about to pounce.

23:33.926 --> 23:36.258
Shoot, he's the only pilot left
in the B.O.Q

23:36.328 --> 23:38.796
Be awful lonesome in there
without him.

23:38.864 --> 23:41.697
How would you know?
You never sleep in the B.O.Q

24:12.030 --> 24:15.898
As nightmares go, this one is definitely
taking a turn for the better.

24:16.902 --> 24:21.896
Even at six months, I found Peg...
stunningly beautiful.

24:21.974 --> 24:24.238
Although, I doubt she'd believe it.

24:24.309 --> 24:28.336
It could be that pregnant women hold
some strange attraction for me, but...

24:28.413 --> 24:30.608
I think it's Peg.

24:30.682 --> 24:33.708
Whatever it is, the chemistry
is definitely working and,

24:33.786 --> 24:35.947
well, I'll just have to
keep telling myself...

24:36.021 --> 24:38.285
I'm not really her husband, Tom.

24:42.227 --> 24:44.218
Would you like to dance?

24:44.296 --> 24:45.854
What?
Dance.

24:47.432 --> 24:50.458
With this stomach?
I can reach around it.

25:31.109 --> 25:34.237
Well, I wanna know who you've
been dancing with, mister.

25:34.313 --> 25:37.305
What? Tom, you may be the
best pilot in the air force,

25:37.382 --> 25:41.580
but you were born
with two left feet... until tonight.

25:41.653 --> 25:45.453
Maybe I just needed
a well-rounded partner.

25:56.468 --> 25:58.459
Peg?
Hmm?

25:59.571 --> 26:01.732
Who's that guy
by the jukebox?

26:03.775 --> 26:05.800
That's Doug.

26:05.878 --> 26:08.642
No, no, no.
The guy in the tux.

26:08.714 --> 26:11.205
A tux? In here?

26:15.320 --> 26:18.847
You don't see a man in a black tux
standing by the jukebox?

26:18.924 --> 26:21.290
Tom, Tom.

26:21.360 --> 26:24.420
Everything is so nice.
Let's not spoil it.

26:24.496 --> 26:27.397
Either someone blocked Peg's view
of the guy in the tux,

26:27.466 --> 26:30.958
or the bogeyman had arrived.

26:31.036 --> 26:34.130
Whichever it was,
I was going to find out.

26:34.206 --> 26:36.936
Oh, Tom. No, you're
six months along, Peg.

26:37.009 --> 26:39.409
At six months, you dance one,
and then sit one out.

26:39.478 --> 26:42.413
Doctor's orders.
But I feel fine,

26:42.481 --> 26:44.949
and we never get
a chance to dance.

26:45.017 --> 26:49.113
This is my favorite song.
I don't want you to overdo it.

26:49.187 --> 26:51.781
Look, we've got
all night, okay?

26:51.857 --> 26:53.518
Okay.

26:53.592 --> 26:55.958
I'm gonna go feed the old
jukebox. I'll be right back.

27:14.012 --> 27:17.345
Isn't this great?

27:17.416 --> 27:19.350
I mean, isn't this just great?

27:19.418 --> 27:21.648
Brings back so many old memories.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.280
Hey, have they got
"Be-Bop-A-Lula" on there?

27:24.356 --> 27:28.349
Got me through some long,
cold nights at M.I.T.

27:28.427 --> 27:33.865
"Be-Bop" and a little
Lithuanian girl named Danesa.

27:33.932 --> 27:35.900
She was in the chemistry lab
researching the...

27:35.968 --> 27:38.232
Am I dead?
What?

27:38.303 --> 27:40.362
Dead. Am I dead?
It would explain a lot.

27:40.439 --> 27:43.431
I could be in a reverse reincarnation
that's entered in midlife.

27:43.508 --> 27:49.242
That's a good one, Sam.
You know my name.

27:49.314 --> 27:51.305
I'm not that wasted.

27:51.383 --> 27:53.578
Why do you know who I am
when no one else does?

27:53.652 --> 27:57.213
Are you serious? Dead
serious. No pun intended.

28:00.092 --> 28:02.322
Oh, my God.

28:02.394 --> 28:05.955
You really don't
recognize me, do you? No.

28:06.031 --> 28:08.898
Or remember the experiment.
What experiment?

28:08.967 --> 28:11.731
What do you remember
prior to waking up this morning?

28:11.803 --> 28:15.705
Other than my name and a telephone
number, not a lot. What experiment?

28:15.774 --> 28:19.175
If I'm part of an experiment, then this
all isn't a psychotic hallucination, is it?

28:19.244 --> 28:21.235
Is it?

28:22.614 --> 28:27.017
Oh, God,
that putz Ziggy was right.

28:27.085 --> 28:30.612
Ziggy? I remember a Ziggy.
A little guy with bad breath.

28:30.689 --> 28:32.680
You're slipping; pard.

28:32.758 --> 28:36.216
Nobody's gonna fall for that old
"talking to somebody who ain't there" gag.

28:56.648 --> 28:58.878
Oh, God. What the hell?

28:58.950 --> 29:01.942
What are we gonna do?

29:03.088 --> 29:07.957
- We're in a rotten fix.
I told him not to...

29:09.661 --> 29:12.721
Though I don't know

29:12.798 --> 29:15.892
Many words of praise

29:15.967 --> 29:17.958
Please, God,

29:19.704 --> 29:22.264
I'd like to wake up now.

29:22.340 --> 29:27.972
Put on your bonnet
your cape and your glove

29:28.046 --> 29:31.379
And come with me

29:33.251 --> 29:35.981
This is KCV530, Victorville.

29:36.054 --> 29:40.787
Here's Velton Bunch
and the Dovetones.

29:40.859 --> 29:43.623
I never realized how hard it was
to follow a road without striping.

29:44.696 --> 29:46.926
Striping?

29:46.998 --> 29:48.932
I was just thinking that,
you know,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.491
if they would paint white stripes
along the side of the road,

29:51.570 --> 29:53.561
it would be easier to see.

29:54.873 --> 29:56.807
That's a very good idea, Tom.

29:56.875 --> 29:59.776
I got a few of them.

30:05.650 --> 30:08.175
Tonight was fun.

30:08.253 --> 30:10.687
Good.

30:10.755 --> 30:13.553
It was a little scary too.
Why scary?

30:14.559 --> 30:17.722
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because...

30:17.796 --> 30:19.787
you wanted to dance.

30:20.999 --> 30:23.490
It's not the first time
we danced.

30:23.568 --> 30:26.560
And you didn't drink more
than one or two beers...

30:26.638 --> 30:29.038
or talk flying.

30:29.107 --> 30:31.098
I can't remember
the last time you sat...

30:31.176 --> 30:33.508
at a table full of pilots
and you didn't talk airplanes.

30:33.578 --> 30:35.512
It seemed to me that's
all we talked about.

30:35.580 --> 30:37.514
That's all they talked about.
You didn't say a word.

30:37.582 --> 30:41.712
I wasn't in a talkative mood.
You were at the jukebox.

30:46.758 --> 30:51.218
"Why is it... "
"When you... "

30:52.264 --> 30:56.030
"Try to pass... "
"The guy in front... "

30:57.269 --> 31:01.228
- "Goes twice as fast?"
- "Burma Shave. "

31:05.310 --> 31:07.904
Oh, it feels nice.

31:07.979 --> 31:11.244
How did it work?
Better than my electric razor,

31:11.316 --> 31:13.307
uh, would.

31:15.620 --> 31:18.282
I don't use an electric razor, do I? No.

31:18.356 --> 31:20.620
No, Tom.

31:20.692 --> 31:23.627
What's going on?
I wish I knew.

31:23.695 --> 31:28.291
- Honey, just tell me, okay?
- What if I told you my name wasn't Tom?

31:28.366 --> 31:30.926
You said that this morning
in the bathroom. It's Sam.

31:31.002 --> 31:35.098
Don't ask me what my last name is
because I can't remember it.

31:35.173 --> 31:37.698
I look in a mirror, and I see...

31:37.776 --> 31:39.710
Tom Stratton, I guess,

31:39.778 --> 31:42.212
but he's not me.

31:43.215 --> 31:45.149
I can't fly.

31:45.217 --> 31:47.208
In fact,
I don't know what I can do.

31:48.820 --> 31:51.550
When I woke up this morning,

31:51.623 --> 31:55.957
I didn't know you or Mikey...
or anyone else at the base.

31:57.696 --> 32:00.221
I know it sounds like I belong
in a loony bin, but it's the truth.

32:00.298 --> 32:03.927
The reason I'm acting different
is because I am different.

32:04.002 --> 32:08.666
- I'm not your Tom.
- Oh, Tom.

32:10.842 --> 32:12.332
Oh, look.

32:14.045 --> 32:17.173
Please don't...
Then stop doing this, okay?

32:17.249 --> 32:19.911
You asked me to explain...
Just stop it, Tom.

32:28.727 --> 32:30.718
I'm sorry, Peg.

32:31.896 --> 32:34.888
I'm being a real nerd.

32:34.966 --> 32:36.957
You were right.
I'm setting up a gag.

32:37.035 --> 32:41.165
- Thank God.
- I shouldn't have tried it on you.

32:41.239 --> 32:43.969
Oh, honey, you had me
scared to death.

32:44.042 --> 32:46.408
I thought you had a brain tumor
or something.

32:46.478 --> 32:48.946
I never thought of that.
What?

32:50.915 --> 32:54.009
Bird Dog and I have been dreaming up
theories to explain why I can't fly.

32:54.085 --> 32:56.019
You see, that's the joke.

32:56.087 --> 32:58.647
I tell Weird Ernie
that I forgot how to fly.

32:58.723 --> 33:01.749
You tell Weird Ernie that
you forgot how to fly. Yeah.

33:01.826 --> 33:04.351
Tom, that is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

33:04.429 --> 33:08.388
I don't know.
It sounds pretty plausible to me.

33:13.605 --> 33:15.937
Tom?
Hmm?

33:16.007 --> 33:17.998
What's a nerd?

33:20.845 --> 33:22.676
Well, it, uh...

34:14.532 --> 34:16.966
What's the matter?

34:17.034 --> 34:20.129
What? Nothing. Go back to sleep.

34:20.205 --> 34:22.196
Okay.

34:26.311 --> 34:28.938
That's all I need,
a good night's sleep.

34:29.013 --> 34:31.208
I'll figure it out in the morning
when I milk the cows.

34:32.217 --> 34:34.208
"Milk the cows"?

34:36.254 --> 34:40.315
I was raised
on a dairy farm in Indiana...

34:40.391 --> 34:42.518
until I was 18.

34:42.594 --> 34:44.585
I went to college at...

34:46.431 --> 34:49.889
Damn, I can't remember.
Stick to the farm.

34:49.967 --> 34:53.960
I was raised on a farm with...
my sister Kate.

34:54.038 --> 34:56.268
Katie married a naval officer.

34:56.341 --> 34:58.639
Um, Lieutenant John...

34:59.644 --> 35:02.841
No, Jim.
Jim Bonick.

35:02.914 --> 35:05.178
Yeah, Katie and Jim Bonick.

35:05.250 --> 35:07.912
Mom's lived with them in Hawaii
ever since...

35:09.320 --> 35:11.845
Dad died in '74.

35:15.393 --> 35:17.384
But this is '56.

35:21.433 --> 35:24.095
My dad is still alive.

35:34.012 --> 35:36.003
Operator.

35:37.749 --> 35:41.048
Operator,
I'd like long distance, please.

35:41.119 --> 35:43.110
Long Distance.

35:45.657 --> 35:47.648
Indiana, please.

35:49.961 --> 35:53.124
Elk Ridge, Indiana.
Number, please.

35:56.034 --> 35:58.093
Number, please.

35:58.169 --> 36:00.899
I'm-I'm-I'm trying, Operator,
but it's been a long time.

36:00.972 --> 36:03.532
Um, it's...

36:06.344 --> 36:08.278
Oakdell.

36:08.346 --> 36:11.804
Yeah, that's it.
Uh, Oakdell...

36:11.883 --> 36:14.750
Sir, why don't you give me
the name of the party,

36:14.819 --> 36:17.652
and I will ring
Elk Ridge Information.

36:19.657 --> 36:21.750
Sir?

36:21.826 --> 36:24.727
Sir, do you want
Elk Ridge Information?

36:31.169 --> 36:35.196
Dad? What's wrong?

36:35.273 --> 36:37.741
I'm just...
I'm catching a cold.

36:37.809 --> 36:39.800
Wanna skip the fishing trip?

36:41.112 --> 36:43.205
- What?
- It's Saturday.

36:43.281 --> 36:45.215
You said we'd go fishing today.

36:45.283 --> 36:48.218
But we don't have to
if you don't feel good.

36:49.487 --> 36:51.478
What are you talking about?

36:51.556 --> 36:54.286
Nothing cures a cold
faster than a fishing trip.

37:14.612 --> 37:16.603
You don't wanna do that.

37:16.681 --> 37:19.309
I just did that to show you
what not to do.

37:20.318 --> 37:23.981
I'll bring it back now, and I'll
show you how it should be done.

37:28.493 --> 37:32.520
Now, remember, Mikey,
even your best fly fisherman...

37:32.597 --> 37:34.724
gets his fly snagged now and then.

37:34.799 --> 37:39.236
But it's the old pro
who can bring it back without...

37:39.304 --> 37:41.295
Can I try now, Dad?

37:50.415 --> 37:52.576
You stay here and fish this,
uh, pool, all right?

37:52.650 --> 37:55.414
I'm gonna fish further upstream. Roger.

37:56.421 --> 38:00.187
Dad, I know you're trying
to make me look good.

38:03.161 --> 38:05.152
Yeah.

38:26.184 --> 38:28.880
Is that a Ginger Quill
spent wing?

38:28.953 --> 38:32.047
Or maybe a Blue Dunn?
I don't know.

38:32.123 --> 38:35.217
I got such a damn hangover.
It could be a Coors pop-top.

38:37.929 --> 38:41.865
Don't yell, please!

38:41.933 --> 38:44.493
I should've stayed in bed
with Tina.

38:45.570 --> 38:47.800
You still don't
remember me, huh?

38:47.872 --> 38:49.863
That's sad, pal, very sad.

38:49.941 --> 38:51.875
My name is Albert.

38:51.943 --> 38:54.810
Albert what, I can't tell you,
because it's restricted.

38:54.879 --> 38:57.712
Most of what you're gonna
wanna know is restricted.

38:57.782 --> 39:00.808
So it'll be easier for us if you
don't ask a lot of questions.

39:00.885 --> 39:03.547
- What are you?
- That's a question, Sam.

39:04.622 --> 39:07.182
I'm a man, like you.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.985
Mmm.

39:13.698 --> 39:17.259
- Not like me.
- Oh, no, uh, this isn't me.

39:17.335 --> 39:20.065
This is, uh,
a neurological hologram.

39:20.138 --> 39:23.164
It's an image that only
you can see and hear.

39:23.241 --> 39:25.402
Created by a subatomic
agitation of carbon quarks...

39:25.476 --> 39:28.240
...tuned to the mesons
of my optic and optic neurons?

39:28.312 --> 39:32.214
- You got it.
- How did I know that?

39:34.852 --> 39:37.988
Ziggy has come up with five
different scenarios to ex...

39:37.989 --> 39:38.788
Ziggy!

39:38.856 --> 39:41.809
Ziggy, a little guy with bad breath.

39:41.810 --> 39:43.020
No, that's Gooshie.

39:43.094 --> 39:46.029
He programs Ziggy.
Ziggy's a hybrid computer.

39:46.097 --> 39:50.295
Hybrid computers and neurological
holograms didn't exist in 1956.

39:50.368 --> 39:52.893
Only in theory.
But this is '56.

39:52.970 --> 39:55.700
Well, it is for you.
It is not for me.

39:55.773 --> 39:57.707
What's my last name?

39:57.775 --> 40:00.073
If you can't remember, I
can't tell you. It's important.

40:00.144 --> 40:03.375
But it's also on top of Ziggy's
no-no list, double-starred.

40:03.448 --> 40:05.382
Why?
I can't tell you that either.

40:05.450 --> 40:07.384
What the hell can you tell me?

40:07.452 --> 40:10.182
Basically, what you already know.

40:10.254 --> 40:14.213
that you're, uh, part of
a time-travel experiment...

40:14.292 --> 40:16.283
that went a little caca.

40:17.662 --> 40:19.653
"A little caca"?

40:20.998 --> 40:24.661
- How little caca?
- Well, you're here, which is a biggie.

40:24.736 --> 40:26.829
I mean, that's a first.
It's Nobel Prize time.

40:26.904 --> 40:28.838
You should be proud of that.
And?

40:28.906 --> 40:31.773
And, uh, uh,
we're experiencing...

40:31.843 --> 40:35.006
technical difficulties in,
uh, retrieving you.

40:37.949 --> 40:40.110
That's great, Al.

40:41.486 --> 40:43.420
I wake up in '56 with a memory
like Swiss cheese,

40:43.488 --> 40:45.513
and you're experiencing
technical difficulties?

40:45.590 --> 40:48.423
Whose brainchild is this, yours?

40:49.427 --> 40:52.294
No, not mine.

40:52.363 --> 40:55.730
I haven't got a lot of time. I have
to find out which of these scenarios...

40:55.800 --> 40:58.792
can explain why we couldn't
retrieve you this morning.

40:58.870 --> 41:01.668
You tried? Of course we
tried. You wouldn't leap.

41:01.739 --> 41:03.866
So now it's my fault.
Possibly.

41:03.941 --> 41:06.967
Did you tell anyone
that you're not Tom Stratton?

41:09.580 --> 41:11.514
Sort of.
Oh, Sam.

41:11.582 --> 41:14.176
Retrieving you is dependent upon
everyone here...

41:14.252 --> 41:16.345
believing that you're
the person you replaced.

41:16.420 --> 41:19.548
They didn't believe me. I look in
a mirror, and I don't believe me.

41:19.624 --> 41:23.390
That's to be expected.
To us, Tom looks just like you.

41:24.796 --> 41:26.730
He's with you?
Of course.

41:26.798 --> 41:29.961
How do you think we located you?
When you went in, he came out.

41:30.034 --> 41:33.561
If it's any consolation,
his memory is full of holes too.

41:33.638 --> 41:37.199
Now, everyone has to believe
that you're Tom Stratton...

41:37.275 --> 41:39.869
if we're gonna be able
to retrieve you on Tuesday.

41:39.944 --> 41:42.071
Tuesday.

41:43.314 --> 41:45.908
Tuesday's gonna be a little late.

41:45.983 --> 41:48.781
I'm, uh...

41:48.853 --> 41:52.289
I'm scheduled to test-fly
the X-2 on Monday.

41:55.860 --> 41:57.851
Did you ever think
of taking flying lessons?

42:01.299 --> 42:03.290
Just a thought.

42:12.510 --> 42:15.240
All right, give me the big one.
Right down the middle.

42:17.682 --> 42:20.082
Not bad, not bad. Right in
the glove. Right in the glove.

42:20.151 --> 42:23.643
Right down the middle. No batter,
no batter, no batter, no batter.

42:23.721 --> 42:26.246
What you need
is a little Texas sauce.

42:26.324 --> 42:29.919
Yeah! Ow. Mmm.

42:29.994 --> 42:33.555
How does he do it?
Probably wearing his hat.

42:37.535 --> 42:40.698
Sometimes Doug
wears his goggles.

42:42.206 --> 42:44.868
Well, I think it's sexy.

42:44.942 --> 42:48.207
I mean, if anything,
that spin became even flatter.

42:48.279 --> 42:50.804
Hi, baby.

42:50.882 --> 42:54.750
I mean, I didn't want to punch out
inverted, but what the hell else could I do?

42:57.822 --> 43:01.280
All right.

43:30.321 --> 43:33.449
Yeah!

43:33.524 --> 43:35.151
Wow!

43:35.226 --> 43:38.684
Did you see that roll and flip
he did at the top, Dad?

43:38.763 --> 43:41.698
What do you call it?
You got me.

43:44.669 --> 43:48.105
- The chandelle, Mikey.
- Wow! It sure was something.

43:49.106 --> 43:53.133
Yeah, it sure was.

43:53.210 --> 43:56.008
I'd better help your mom.

43:56.080 --> 43:58.173
Aw, Dad.
Unless you wanna set the table.

43:58.249 --> 44:00.342
Hey, Captain Crawford,
wanna play catch?

44:00.418 --> 44:02.784
Sure do.
Fire one on in there, Mikey.

44:14.398 --> 44:16.389
Hi.
Hi.

44:20.638 --> 44:22.765
You okay?
I'm fine.

44:24.141 --> 44:27.508
You look a little pale.
Yeah, well, it's the heat.

44:27.578 --> 44:29.512
I'll never get used to it.

44:29.580 --> 44:32.481
You want me to help?
I make a mean Caesar salad.

44:32.550 --> 44:35.178
I'm just kidding.
I know.

44:36.187 --> 44:38.382
But not about how you look.

44:38.456 --> 44:40.447
Well, that's your fault.

44:41.859 --> 44:44.453
That's not what I meant.
Look, I'm fine.

44:44.528 --> 44:46.462
I really am.

44:46.530 --> 44:49.658
Why don't you just go back
on out there with Mikey?

44:49.734 --> 44:54.171
You know, you haven't spent this much
time with him since he was hit by the bus.

44:56.440 --> 44:58.431
Okay.

45:00.411 --> 45:03.380
Hey, flyboy.

45:22.666 --> 45:25.328
Come and get it.
Uh...

45:25.403 --> 45:27.667
Got to eat trout
while it's sizzling.

45:27.738 --> 45:29.706
Yeah.

45:29.774 --> 45:33.141
Why don't you take the salad out?
I'll get the rolls.

45:33.210 --> 45:35.235
Yeah.

45:50.694 --> 45:52.292
I'm sorry to pull you
from your barbecue,

45:52.293 --> 45:54.460
but Dr. Berger and I have just
finished a questionnaire...

45:54.532 --> 45:58.400
to test Captain Birdell's theory that Mach
3 flight has a negative effect on the memory.

45:58.469 --> 46:01.131
Quite frankly, if this theory had
come from you, I'd be skeptical.

46:01.205 --> 46:04.697
We all know your penchant
for practical jokes, eh?

46:04.775 --> 46:07.608
Doctor, any memory loss
I suffer won't be faked.

46:07.678 --> 46:10.044
We're going to call it the
Ernst-Berger Engramic Standard.

46:10.114 --> 46:14.312
200 questions designed to
benchmark a person's memory.

46:14.385 --> 46:17.320
I thought we were gonna call it
the Berger-Ernst Engramic Standard.

46:17.388 --> 46:18.855
Hi, Tom.
Hi.

46:18.923 --> 46:21.858
These questions should give us
a cross section of your memory.

46:21.926 --> 46:25.828
Some, like your age, place of birth,
are the usual statistics.

46:25.896 --> 46:29.388
But I think you'll find
most are rather unusual.

46:29.467 --> 46:32.265
What was the coldest
you've ever been?

46:32.336 --> 46:34.327
Who was your second-best friend
in college?

46:35.573 --> 46:37.507
Where did you first make love?

46:39.477 --> 46:41.638
Well, at least you didn't ask to who.

46:41.712 --> 46:43.805
Dr. Ernst suggested that,

46:43.881 --> 46:47.146
but where is as meaningful
and more discreet.

46:47.218 --> 46:49.209
Sort of a personal "Trivial Pursuit"?

46:51.122 --> 46:53.056
Not a bad name.

46:53.124 --> 46:55.354
The Berger-Ernst
Engramic Trivial Pursuit.

46:55.426 --> 46:59.157
Ernst-Berger. We'll need this filled
out before you take off on Monday.

46:59.230 --> 47:01.164
You'll fill it out
again when you land.

47:01.232 --> 47:04.497
If there are any significant changes in your
memory, we should be able to detect them.

47:04.568 --> 47:07.264
- Any questions, Captain?
- Uh, no, no.

47:07.338 --> 47:11.502
It seems simple enough. I’ll, hum...
I'll have it for you on Monday.

47:12.676 --> 47:14.667
Doctors.

47:21.352 --> 47:24.844
Doctor, we could be on the verge
of a momentous discovery.

47:24.922 --> 47:28.824
Or the butt of a momentous joke.

48:07.131 --> 48:10.726
Pretty simple, huh?

48:10.801 --> 48:12.632
Can't you just
fade in or something?

48:12.703 --> 48:17.265
You tell me how to fade in agitated carbon
quarks, and I'll make the Scientific Journal.

48:17.341 --> 48:22.176
Just don't sneak up on me. You
still don't remember our project?

48:22.246 --> 48:26.979
Bad enough I have to give Dick-and-Jane
explanations to the president.

48:27.051 --> 48:30.543
I've gotta give you one too.
All right.

48:30.621 --> 48:34.022
One end of this string
represents your birth.

48:34.091 --> 48:39.688
The other end, your death. You tie the
ends together, and your life is a loop.

48:39.763 --> 48:42.391
Ball the loop...

48:44.001 --> 48:47.664
and the days of your life
touch each other out of sequence.

48:47.738 --> 48:50.730
Therefore, leaping from one point
of the string to another...

48:50.808 --> 48:53.208
Would move you backward or forward
within your own lifetime.

48:53.277 --> 48:55.939
Which is our project,
Quantum Leap!

48:57.781 --> 48:59.715
I can't remember.

49:02.720 --> 49:05.382
Al! I wish you would stop doing that.

49:05.456 --> 49:07.515
What?

49:07.591 --> 49:09.923
Walking through things.

49:09.994 --> 49:14.795
Well, you want me to walk around something that
isn't even here? All right, I'll walk around it.

49:14.865 --> 49:18.892
There. How's that?
Why- Why isn't it here?

49:18.969 --> 49:24.032
I'm a hologram to you, right? Well, you and
everything around you is a hologram to me.

49:24.108 --> 49:27.305
You're in the imaging
chamber. You remember.

49:27.378 --> 49:29.938
Vaguely. A cavern somewhere. New Mexico.

49:30.014 --> 49:32.505
What year is it there?

49:32.583 --> 49:36.417
You'll find that out...
if we get you back. If?

49:36.487 --> 49:39.251
Well, see, Ziggy's theory is really...
It's a load of crap.

49:39.323 --> 49:43.282
I mean, you gotta believe
that God or time or something...

49:43.360 --> 49:47.694
was just waiting for
your quantum leap to, uh,

49:47.765 --> 49:51.223
to correct a mistake.
A mistake in time?

49:51.302 --> 49:54.897
Something that happened in the life
of Captain Tom Stratton in '56,

49:54.972 --> 49:57.236
since he's the one you bounced out.

49:57.308 --> 50:01.335
Once that's put right,
you'll snap back like a pimp's suspenders.

50:01.412 --> 50:02.879
Once what's put right?

50:02.946 --> 50:07.406
Tom Stratton was killed
trying to break Mach 3 in the X-2.

50:07.484 --> 50:12.353
If Ziggy's right,
all you have to do is break Mach 3...

50:12.423 --> 50:13.947
and live.

50:19.797 --> 50:21.731
Hey!
No way.

50:21.799 --> 50:24.199
Hey, pal, it's not my theory.
There's gotta be another way.

50:24.268 --> 50:26.566
The next one's only got
a 52% chance of working.

50:26.637 --> 50:28.571
I'll take it.

50:28.639 --> 50:31.972
It requires you to be at ground zero
during an atomic detonation.

50:33.210 --> 50:36.202
You asked.
What else have you got?

50:36.280 --> 50:39.681
This isn't a shopping list, you know.

50:39.750 --> 50:42.150
The odds drop into
the low teens after that.

50:42.219 --> 50:47.384
Your best shot is freezing the brain
until all electrical activity has ceased.

50:47.458 --> 50:50.894
That's called death.
I never said it would be easy.

50:52.363 --> 50:55.298
Hey, slow down, will ya?
I'm fighting a hangover.

50:55.366 --> 50:57.891
All right, you want a sure thing?
I got it for you.

50:57.968 --> 51:01.495
You don't do anything. You just live.
Barring accidental death...

51:01.572 --> 51:04.268
or a fatal disease,
you'll be back in 40 years.

51:04.341 --> 51:07.310
That's your safest option.
And Tom Stratton?

51:07.378 --> 51:10.006
He'll go on living forward
from where he's at now.

51:10.080 --> 51:14.176
Technically, he could end up
the oldest man alive.

51:14.251 --> 51:18.415
Well, what about Peg and Mikey? I don't want to
hurt them, but I can't go on pretending I'm Tom.

51:18.489 --> 51:21.856
Hey, they were gonna
lose him on Monday anyway.

51:21.925 --> 51:25.258
Of course,
if you bust Mach 3 and survive,

51:25.329 --> 51:28.457
they could have him around for
another 30 or 40 years. I can't fly!

51:28.532 --> 51:30.466
I'll be your copilot.
You're a hologram.

51:30.534 --> 51:34.493
I'm also an ex-astronaut. The hardest part
about flying is taking off and landing.

51:34.571 --> 51:38.940
The B-50 does the first part for you.
After that, you just fire a couple of rockets,

51:39.009 --> 51:42.172
hang on to the stick
and ka-za-zoom, Mach 3.

51:42.246 --> 51:44.840
And the second part?
Landing?

51:46.283 --> 51:50.811
You could never land the X-2, not
even with my help. So, you don't.

51:50.888 --> 51:53.686
I eject?
Mmm.

51:53.757 --> 51:56.988
X-2 does a crash and burn.
You float back to earth on a pillow of silk.

51:57.060 --> 52:00.791
The moment you touch down, you leap forward,
Tom leaps back, and the broad and I...

52:00.864 --> 52:03.196
are gone to Las Vegas.
It might work.

52:03.267 --> 52:05.201
Of course it'll work.

52:05.269 --> 52:07.635
A minute ago
you said it was crap.

52:10.874 --> 52:13.365
That was before I thought it out.

52:56.753 --> 52:59.221
Tom?

52:59.289 --> 53:02.747
You should be asleep.
And you shouldn't be?

53:09.633 --> 53:12.193
You're worried about breaking
the record tomorrow, aren't you?

53:15.339 --> 53:17.273
No.

53:17.341 --> 53:22.369
Oh, honey, you'll do it.
You're gonna be the fastest man alive.

53:29.620 --> 53:31.611
Tom...

53:34.558 --> 53:36.492
promise me.

53:36.560 --> 53:40.018
What?
No, you have to promise first.

53:40.097 --> 53:43.066
Well, that's silly. How can I promise
something if I don't know what...

53:43.133 --> 53:46.830
Just promise.

53:49.006 --> 53:52.498
I promise.

53:52.576 --> 53:54.635
Now, what did I promise?

53:56.213 --> 53:58.443
I'll tell you tomorrow night.

54:36.019 --> 54:38.010
Thanks, guys.

54:43.193 --> 54:46.788
Well, ready to become
the fastest man on earth?

54:46.863 --> 54:50.629
Ready as I'll ever be.

54:50.701 --> 54:53.898
Oh. What did you
think of this, Tom?

54:53.971 --> 54:59.375
Well, I'm not sure how useful it'll be
to gauge a memory loss, but, uh,

54:59.443 --> 55:03.436
filling it out last night sure brought back
a lot of old ones for me.

55:33.010 --> 55:37.538
Well, my boobs
are as big as Marilyn's.

55:37.614 --> 55:41.050
Lucy, you're
five months pregnant.

55:41.118 --> 55:45.213
Well, maybe she is too. Why else
would a guy like Miller marry her?

55:45.214 --> 55:46.053
Guess.

55:46.123 --> 55:51.393
Sally, he's a writer.
They're only used to the finer things in life.

55:51.461 --> 55:53.793
Honey, there is nothing finer in life.

55:53.864 --> 55:56.924
You are so bad!

56:34.871 --> 56:38.466
<i>There's a yellow rose in Texas</i>

56:38.542 --> 56:41.136
<i>That I am gonna see</i>

56:41.211 --> 56:43.475
<i>Nobody else could miss her</i>

56:43.547 --> 56:46.072
<i>Not half as much as me</i>

56:46.149 --> 56:48.083
<i>She cried so when I left her</i>

56:48.151 --> 56:50.620
Hey, wait a minute. Listen to this.

56:50.621 --> 56:52.383
<i>It like to broke my heart</i>

56:52.456 --> 56:56.517
<i>And if I ever find her
we'll never fall apart</i>

56:56.593 --> 56:58.959
If you don't clear this radio,
Captain Birdell,

56:59.029 --> 57:02.192
the only yellow rose you'll be seeing will be
the one I'll shove up your afterburners.

57:02.265 --> 57:05.757
- Is that clear? Over.
- Uh, that's a roger, Edwards.

57:08.438 --> 57:11.134
Read this.

57:11.208 --> 57:15.736
"Date of birth,
August 8th, 19... 53."

57:15.812 --> 57:19.373
- Well, that's a typo. He means 1923.
- Keep reading.

57:19.950 --> 57:24.410
"What had the most positive impact on
me in high school? Answer: miniskirts.

57:26.289 --> 57:32.086
"What had the most negative impact
on me in high school? Answer: panty hose? "

57:37.634 --> 57:39.568
It's time to mount up, Tom.

57:39.636 --> 57:43.402
Hey, Tom, this is gonna sound
a little weird, but...

57:43.473 --> 57:47.341
right before I got the fire warning light,
I swear I smelled coffee brewing.

57:47.410 --> 57:50.072
Maybe it's one of
Weird Ernie's gremlins.

57:50.147 --> 57:52.081
Yeah, maybe.

57:52.149 --> 57:54.310
Good luck, Tom.

58:07.964 --> 58:10.592
Where are you, Albert?

58:21.444 --> 58:23.469
Hmm.

58:32.122 --> 58:35.956
"When feeling lonely, I rent a video
and microwave some popcorn. "

58:36.026 --> 58:39.962
This is gibberish.
Very creative gibberish.

58:40.030 --> 58:42.726
Captain Stratton has answered
each question as if he had...

58:42.799 --> 58:45.563
been born in '53
and lived in the future.

58:45.635 --> 58:48.695
Then this whole memory loss thing
is another one of their hoaxes.

58:48.772 --> 58:51.570
I'm afraid so.
Well, how stupid do they think I am?

58:51.641 --> 58:54.633
Pet rocks. Water beds.

58:54.711 --> 58:58.374
What was it he said he was expelled
from college for? Uh, streaking.

58:58.448 --> 59:01.884
He's got a sick mind, Doctor.
They all do.

59:04.254 --> 59:06.245
Maybe they have to.

59:10.393 --> 59:14.921
Okay.

59:18.168 --> 59:22.764
Uh, Albert?

59:51.167 --> 59:54.830
Locked tight. All set, Captain.
Good luck.

01:00:11.521 --> 01:00:14.388
<i>Edwards, Mother Hen.
Level at 25,000.</i>

01:00:14.457 --> 01:00:19.087
Roger, Mother Hen.
You are clear to drop.

01:00:19.162 --> 01:00:21.528
Good luck.

01:00:21.598 --> 01:00:24.692
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

<i>four, three, two,</i>

01:00:34.444 --> 01:00:36.571
<i>one.
Albert!</i>

01:00:36.646 --> 01:00:39.206
Bombs away.

01:00:41.418 --> 01:00:46.412
<i>Albert.!</i>

01:00:48.558 --> 01:00:52.324
<i>X-2, Chase One.
Do you have a problem? Over. </i>

01:00:52.395 --> 01:00:55.159
I can't fly.

01:00:55.231 --> 01:00:58.564
Relax. I can.
Al?

01:00:58.635 --> 01:01:03.470
Al? Where are you?
Right here.

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:07.169
<i>Hey, Tom, do you read me?
Come in, X-2.</i>

01:01:07.243 --> 01:01:11.179
Follow my lead.
Light off one and two.

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:20.287
It's a kick in the butt, ain't it?

01:01:20.357 --> 01:01:22.689
Match my movements.

01:01:39.175 --> 01:01:41.370
Where the hell were you?

01:01:41.444 --> 01:01:43.878
I was at the Laker game.
It went into overtime.

01:01:43.947 --> 01:01:46.745
A ball game? I nearly died
because you were at a ball game?

01:01:46.816 --> 01:01:50.980
It wasn’t just a ball game.
It was a play-off game.

01:01:51.054 --> 01:01:54.319
At the party later,
I met this dish named Martha.

01:01:54.391 --> 01:01:58.384
I guess I can thank God you didn't
spend the night with this Martha.

01:01:58.461 --> 01:02:03.125
Well, I did.
Uh, coming up on Mach 1.

01:02:03.199 --> 01:02:05.224
Coming up on Mach 1.

01:02:20.717 --> 01:02:22.947
Mach 1.3.
Nosing over.

01:02:23.019 --> 01:02:25.613
Mach 1.3. 50,000.
N- N-Nosing over.

01:02:25.688 --> 01:02:28.020
Now ease the stick forward.
That's enough.

01:02:31.094 --> 01:02:33.995
Mach 1.7.

01:02:34.064 --> 01:02:36.032
Mach 2. 68, 69.

01:02:36.099 --> 01:02:39.830
Mach 2.

01:02:39.903 --> 01:02:45.273
Level at 70,000.
Mach 2.4. On a profile.

01:02:45.341 --> 01:02:48.208
Level at 70,000.
Mach 2.4.

01:02:48.278 --> 01:02:50.610
On profile.

01:02:52.615 --> 01:02:54.879
Wow.!

01:02:56.653 --> 01:02:58.883
It's incredible!

01:03:00.423 --> 01:03:05.451
- What now?
- Punch three and go for it.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:15.503
Mach 2.4, 2.5.
Outside skin temperature. 685.

01:03:15.572 --> 01:03:20.635
- Mach 2.7. Skin temperature. 750.
- Ride her, cowboy.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:26.916
Mach 2.8.

01:03:26.983 --> 01:03:30.680
- Do you hear that?
- Mach 2.9. Yes.

01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:38.352
Tony didn't smell coffee.
He heard it perking.

01:03:38.428 --> 01:03:41.295
It's the fuel, Sam.

01:03:41.364 --> 01:03:45.391
The heat is boiling the fuel.
Shut 'em down, Sam. Shut 'em down!

01:03:45.468 --> 01:03:46.901
Shut 'em down.!

01:04:10.693 --> 01:04:14.254
Pull, Sam. Eject.!

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.989
I'm still here.
No, damn it, I'm still here.!

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.591
Al!

01:05:40.049 --> 01:05:43.712
You know, Captain, we could be combing the
desert with tweezers and little glass jars...

01:05:43.786 --> 01:05:46.653
looking for what's left of you.

01:05:46.723 --> 01:05:51.160
You guys are all alike. Losing your
plane's worse than losing your wife.

01:05:51.227 --> 01:05:54.060
I'd trade my ex-wife
for any wreck they got.

01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:57.657
I'm still here.
Hmm. 'Bout time you realized it.

01:05:57.734 --> 01:05:59.725
What now? I'm going to
take your blood pressure.

01:05:59.802 --> 01:06:02.566
We could try the A-bomb
theory. No, thank you.

01:06:02.639 --> 01:06:06.302
Well, I'm sorry, but it's
necessary. It's not my theory, Sam.

01:06:06.376 --> 01:06:11.006
I never bought into that "good deed,
put time right" bull. Not really.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.378
So I'm stuck here?
I don't think so.

01:06:13.449 --> 01:06:17.385
Maybe not. A few tests at the hospital,
and you should be able to go home.

01:06:17.453 --> 01:06:20.081
Maybe you could leap back when you least
suspect it, like tonight when you're sleeping.

01:06:20.156 --> 01:06:23.353
Do you really believe that?
Absolutely. I don't know.

01:06:23.426 --> 01:06:25.792
I don't see any reason to keep you
in the hospital. But in the meantime,

01:06:25.862 --> 01:06:29.389
there's no reason for me to stay here,
and I would feel really bad...

01:06:29.465 --> 01:06:34.266
if Martha woke up and found out that I'd gone
without even saying good morning, you know?

01:06:34.337 --> 01:06:36.464
It's not nice.

01:06:38.675 --> 01:06:41.235
Unless your blood pressure
keeps elevating.

01:06:50.787 --> 01:06:56.190
<i>Dr. Berger,
please contact the ward nurse. </i>

01:06:56.259 --> 01:06:58.250
Daddy!

01:06:59.595 --> 01:07:02.621
Hey.
Hey, I'm okay.

01:07:07.337 --> 01:07:11.364
Peg went into premature labor
when she heard the crash.

01:07:11.441 --> 01:07:13.432
Okay, I'll be right.

01:07:16.412 --> 01:07:20.906
Look, I know you want
to be with your mom.

01:07:20.983 --> 01:07:23.008
And you will.
But, uh,

01:07:23.086 --> 01:07:27.284
right now I want you to stay
with Sally and Lucy, okay?

01:07:27.357 --> 01:07:31.316
They're both pregnant, and they're
very frightened. You understand?

01:07:32.628 --> 01:07:35.392
Yes, sir.

01:07:35.465 --> 01:07:38.400
She'll be fine, son.

01:07:38.468 --> 01:07:40.459
I promise.

01:07:44.474 --> 01:07:46.465
Tom, what...

01:07:55.585 --> 01:07:57.519
Is she dilated any further?

01:07:57.587 --> 01:08:00.078
Tom. Tom!

01:08:01.824 --> 01:08:04.759
Oh.! Oh.!

01:08:04.827 --> 01:08:06.818
Oh!

01:08:11.134 --> 01:08:14.900
Oh, I knew
you'd keep your promise.

01:08:14.971 --> 01:08:17.404
It'll take more than
a gremlin to kill me.

01:08:17.473 --> 01:08:20.135
Hey, did you set a record?

01:08:20.209 --> 01:08:24.839
I guess so.
Oh, I'm so proud of you!

01:08:28.216 --> 01:08:31.709
Look at me. Look at me.
Take a deep breath.

01:08:31.787 --> 01:08:34.984
Hold it...
and let it out like this.

01:08:44.033 --> 01:08:46.661
Okay?

01:08:46.736 --> 01:08:49.899
Where did you learn to do that? Premed.

01:08:51.474 --> 01:08:53.499
Oh, Tom!

01:08:55.444 --> 01:08:57.675
Excuse me. Tom?

01:08:59.982 --> 01:09:01.916
I'll be right back.

01:09:07.423 --> 01:09:10.290
Tom, this is Dr. Blaustein.

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:15.091
It's not good, Captain. The baby's
gonna arrive at least nine weeks premature.

01:09:15.163 --> 01:09:18.361
The nearest neonatal
intensive care unit's in L.A.

01:09:18.434 --> 01:09:19.830
Now, we've got a plane standing by...

01:09:19.831 --> 01:09:22.063
but considering the shock
that your wife's been through...

01:09:22.138 --> 01:09:24.072
I don't want to risk moving her.

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:29.077
It's your decision, Tom. I'd recommend
delivering here and flying the baby to L.A.

01:09:29.145 --> 01:09:32.511
The baby won't have a chance.
Not much, but your wife will.

01:09:34.283 --> 01:09:38.777
Dr. Cooper to O.R. 3.
Dr. Cooper to O.R. 3.

01:09:38.854 --> 01:09:40.948
How far apart are
the contractions?

01:09:41.023 --> 01:09:43.890
It's early labor. It's just
started. How far dilated?

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.451
Two centimeters,
and the cervix is partial effaced.

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:51.488
Then it's early enough to stop. Captain,
once labor's started you can't stop it.

01:09:51.567 --> 01:09:56.595
Of course you can. Start her on
a beta sympathomimetic. A what?

01:09:56.672 --> 01:09:59.539
A beta sympathomimetic.

01:09:59.609 --> 01:10:04.376
I'm not sure which one. Obstetrics isn't
my specialty. Probably ritodrine or terbuta...

01:10:04.447 --> 01:10:08.474
Hell, those didn't come out till the
late '70s. Excuse us a minute, Doctor.

01:10:08.551 --> 01:10:11.748
Captain, the only reason I'm not
kicking you from here to the flight line...

01:10:11.821 --> 01:10:13.686
is that woman down the hall needs you.

01:10:13.756 --> 01:10:18.352
She doesn't have to deliver. I know what
I'm talking about. Now you're a doctor?

01:10:18.427 --> 01:10:20.588
Evidently.

01:10:20.663 --> 01:10:22.961
Tom, considering what
you've been through today,

01:10:23.032 --> 01:10:25.728
I'm gonna make an allowance
for your behavior up to now.

01:10:25.801 --> 01:10:29.760
But if you persist in wasting our time with
this little sham you and Captain Birdell...

01:10:29.839 --> 01:10:33.434
are trying to perpetrate, mister,
I'll see you never fly again!

01:10:33.509 --> 01:10:36.410
It's not a sham.
Those answers are true.

01:10:36.479 --> 01:10:40.939
Dr. Ernst was right.
You are one sick bastard.

01:10:41.017 --> 01:10:43.042
Alcohol.

01:10:43.119 --> 01:10:46.452
A five percent solution of ethanol
alcohol in dextrose and water...

01:10:46.522 --> 01:10:48.513
intravenously administered
will stop labor.

01:10:48.591 --> 01:10:52.721
The technique was developed in the '60s.
Beta sympathomimetics replaced it in the '70s.

01:10:52.795 --> 01:10:55.389
But it'll still work.
Use your brain, damn it!

01:10:55.464 --> 01:10:58.262
What will an intravenous
five percent solution of alcohol do?

01:10:59.335 --> 01:11:01.326
Get her instantly drunk,

01:11:02.838 --> 01:11:06.638
which will interfere
with the oxytocins...

01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:09.769
her brain's releasing
to stimulate the uterine contractions.

01:11:09.845 --> 01:11:14.373
Thank you.

01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:16.475
Did you hear any of that, Barry?
Yeah, I did.

01:11:16.552 --> 01:11:20.181
What do you think? Well, let's give
it a try. Nurse, prepare an I.V...

01:11:20.256 --> 01:11:24.215
Que sera, sera

01:11:24.293 --> 01:11:29.424
Whatever will be, will be

01:11:29.498 --> 01:11:34.265
The future's not ours to see

01:11:34.337 --> 01:11:37.898
Que sera, sera

01:11:37.974 --> 01:11:43.537
What will be, will be

01:11:46.415 --> 01:11:48.383
Well, what do you think, boys?

01:11:48.451 --> 01:11:52.114
We have Doris Day
for a patient. Well?

01:11:52.188 --> 01:11:56.420
She's gonna have one beaut of a
hangover, but she's not gonna deliver.

01:11:56.492 --> 01:11:58.738
Do you want to tell me how
in the hell Captain Stratton...

01:11:58.739 --> 01:11:59.620
Barry, do me a favor.

01:11:59.695 --> 01:12:02.664
Hmm?
Don't ask.

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:06.967
Hey, flyboy,
the squares are gone.

01:12:07.036 --> 01:12:09.027
You wanna boogie?

01:12:18.648 --> 01:12:21.276
I love you.

01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:23.648
I love you too, Peg.

01:13:23.913 --> 01:13:27.007
Hey, Fox.!
Fox, what ya posing for?

01:13:27.083 --> 01:13:30.314
Ain't nobody gonna take your picture.

01:13:43.332 --> 01:13:46.665
Nice catch, Foxy.

01:13:46.736 --> 01:13:50.365
This is it, folks.
Down by five, the last of the ninth.

01:13:50.439 --> 01:13:55.103
Unless the Bombers can pull a miracle and
win this final game of the 68th season,

01:13:55.177 --> 01:13:58.044
it's the cellar
for the third year in a row.

01:13:58.114 --> 01:14:02.642
The bottom of the ninth is brought to
you tonight, as it has been all year long,

01:14:02.718 --> 01:14:05.186
by Shneck and Shneck
Funeral Parlors,

01:14:05.254 --> 01:14:09.623
serving Waco and
the Texas Hill Country for 43 years.

01:14:09.692 --> 01:14:12.991
All right, now, put some fire under it.!

01:14:13.062 --> 01:14:17.897
Hustle, boys! Now hustle!
We're gonna beat these Okies.

01:14:35.117 --> 01:14:38.382
Fox! Do something!

01:14:38.454 --> 01:14:40.718
Me? Why me?

01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:42.314
It's your dog.

01:14:44.593 --> 01:14:48.427
He knew. The little sucker knew.

01:14:48.497 --> 01:14:51.523
And he wasn't gonna stop barking
until they all knew.

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:54.330
Stray dogs are pretty common
on the farm belt,

01:14:54.403 --> 01:14:57.861
and one of the first things my dad taught
me was how to face the wild ones down.

01:14:59.074 --> 01:15:02.100
You look them straight in the eye,
and you let 'em know who's boss.

01:15:10.352 --> 01:15:14.550
Of course, it had been a long time
since I was a kid.

01:15:17.026 --> 01:15:19.051
Then again,

01:15:21.463 --> 01:15:25.126
once you've got the touch,
you never lose it.

01:15:25.201 --> 01:15:27.726
- That's the damnedest thing I ever saw.
- How'd you teach him that, Foxy?

01:15:27.803 --> 01:15:29.794
Well... Aah!

01:15:31.807 --> 01:15:34.537
Barnes lines a solid shot
down the aisle in right center.

01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:38.444
Pace is chasing it back into the corner.
Barnes is rounding first.

01:15:41.150 --> 01:15:43.584
Here comes the throw to second, and he
- Safe!

01:15:43.652 --> 01:15:45.313
He's safe!

01:15:45.387 --> 01:15:50.256
Well, the Bombers get their second hit
of the game, and it's a double! Oh!

01:15:52.294 --> 01:15:56.788
No wonder they're in the cellar. They got
about as much enthusiasm as a $10 hooker.

01:15:56.866 --> 01:15:58.834
Come on.

01:15:58.901 --> 01:16:01.836
I want to watch the game.
Will you follow me?

01:16:01.904 --> 01:16:05.931
- I can't. I'm up after Matt.
- Yeah. Right.

01:16:06.008 --> 01:16:09.774
- Something wrong, Fox?
- Uh, no. I'm gonna...

01:16:09.845 --> 01:16:13.679
I'll be back in a minute. I'm
just gonna,... you know.

01:16:13.749 --> 01:16:16.217
Make it snappy.

01:16:17.319 --> 01:16:19.082
Strike!

01:16:19.154 --> 01:16:23.682
The next son of a gun that swings at
the first pitch, I'm gonna fine 50 bucks!

01:16:23.759 --> 01:16:25.750
Al!

01:16:32.301 --> 01:16:34.462
How'd you get here so fast?

01:16:34.536 --> 01:16:37.164
It's been a week since
you quantum leaped. A week?

01:16:37.239 --> 01:16:40.834
A couple of minutes ago
I was in the hospital with Peg.

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:44.607
Well, you've been bouncing
around in time, Sam.

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:46.944
It may have seemed like
a couple of minutes to you,

01:16:47.016 --> 01:16:50.543
but we've been popping
champagne for six days.

01:16:50.619 --> 01:16:53.315
Oh, it was a hell of a party too.

01:16:53.389 --> 01:16:57.758
Gooshie, he got so wasted that
he had Ziggy printing X-rated pictures.

01:16:57.826 --> 01:17:00.454
And you know Brenda,
the cute little redhead in coding?

01:17:00.529 --> 01:17:03.555
She got so turned on!

01:17:03.632 --> 01:17:06.294
No, I don't know Brenda,
or I don't remember Brenda.

01:17:06.368 --> 01:17:08.734
And I certainly don't care
how turned on she got.

01:17:08.804 --> 01:17:12.001
I'm in a real identity crisis here, Al.

01:17:12.074 --> 01:17:15.635
I mean, one minute I'm Tom Stratton,
and the next I'm a ball player named Fox.

01:17:15.711 --> 01:17:20.512
Tim Fox, 32-year-old third baseman
for the Waco Bombers.

01:17:20.582 --> 01:17:25.019
According to Ziggy, you hit... 415 in
'63 and got called up to Chicago...

01:17:25.087 --> 01:17:30.992
where you broke your leg sliding into
second and got sent back down to recover.

01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:33.324
That was five years ago.

01:17:44.606 --> 01:17:46.540
Oh, boy!

01:17:46.608 --> 01:17:49.577
Hey, come on, Sam.
We're missing the game!

01:17:49.645 --> 01:17:52.375
The hell with the game!
It's your last one in organized ball.

01:17:52.448 --> 01:17:55.212
In a couple of minutes
you're gonna fly out to center.

01:17:55.284 --> 01:17:57.309
The Bombers are gonna finish
another season in the cellar,

01:17:57.386 --> 01:18:00.913
and you're gonna hang up
your spikes. Then what?

01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:04.255
Well, you're gonna open up a Kentucky
Fried Chicken franchise. What?

01:18:04.326 --> 01:18:06.590
You'll marry a girl named Sue
and have two kids.

01:18:06.662 --> 01:18:08.596
Of course, you don't have to be
around for all of that.

01:18:08.664 --> 01:18:14.068
Soon as we can figure out what needs
to be put right, you'll leap outta here.

01:18:14.136 --> 01:18:17.367
Like fly the X-2
to Mach 3 and live?

01:18:17.439 --> 01:18:19.236
Hey, Ziggy blew it!
Yeah.

01:18:19.308 --> 01:18:23.472
He didn't research it enough.
Originally, Tom Stratton not only died,

01:18:23.545 --> 01:18:26.981
but his wife went into premature labor,
and the baby was stillborn.

01:18:27.049 --> 01:18:28.573
And now?
Tom's alive!

01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:32.313
Peg gave birth to a healthy baby girl,
seven pounds, eight ounces.

01:18:32.388 --> 01:18:36.324
Funny thing.
They happened to name her Samantha.

01:18:36.392 --> 01:18:39.418
Seems like someone wanted
both Tom and Samantha to survive.

01:18:39.495 --> 01:18:41.087
Yeah.

01:18:41.163 --> 01:18:44.064
Come on, Jackson's up.
He's gonna hit a homer with one on!

01:18:45.667 --> 01:18:48.534
You're a vampire.

01:18:48.604 --> 01:18:52.631
What? Neurological
holograms don't reflect, Sam.

01:18:52.708 --> 01:18:56.769
Obviously when it comes to quantum
physics, you're still a mental slug.

01:18:56.845 --> 01:18:59.643
But we can talk about this later.
Come on. I hate to miss the game.

01:18:59.715 --> 01:19:02.240
You already know how
it's going to end.

01:19:02.317 --> 01:19:08.051
I knew how it was gonna end
when I took Brenda into the filing room.

01:19:08.123 --> 01:19:10.284
I still took her.

01:19:12.761 --> 01:19:15.924
There's the homer.
Why didn't I leap all the way?

01:19:15.998 --> 01:19:19.593
Twelve years in a blink isn't bad, pal.
A couple more of those, you'll be back home.

01:19:19.668 --> 01:19:22.865
If I leap forward again.
What if I leap back?

01:19:22.938 --> 01:19:24.997
That is always possible.

01:19:25.074 --> 01:19:27.907
In other words, I could be
bouncing around in time forever?

01:19:27.976 --> 01:19:30.968
No. Nobody lives forever.

01:19:34.716 --> 01:19:38.447
What does Ziggy say I have to put right
to leap this time? He isn't saying.

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:39.885
What?
He's depressed.

01:19:39.955 --> 01:19:42.321
He's a computer.
He's got a big ego.

01:19:42.391 --> 01:19:47.727
I think he knows what you have to do. He's
just afraid to print it out in case he's wrong.

01:19:47.796 --> 01:19:50.196
Who created this Ziggy?

01:19:53.769 --> 01:19:59.674
You. Quantum Leap
is your project, Sam.

01:19:59.741 --> 01:20:02.175
You're the genius behind it.

01:20:02.244 --> 01:20:05.907
At least you were before
your brain got magna-foozled.

01:20:05.981 --> 01:20:11.385
No, no. See, I'm a medical doctor.
I found that much out.

01:20:11.453 --> 01:20:13.353
You hold six doctorates, Sam.

01:20:13.422 --> 01:20:17.324
Medicine is just one of them.
Your special gift was quantum physics.

01:20:17.392 --> 01:20:20.054
Time magazine even
called you the next Einstein.

01:20:20.129 --> 01:20:22.324
The truth is...

01:20:22.397 --> 01:20:27.266
if there's one guy who could
figure out how to bring you back...

01:20:27.336 --> 01:20:29.270
it's you.

01:20:34.543 --> 01:20:37.307
And I can't even
remember my name.

01:20:42.584 --> 01:20:47.044
It's Beckett.

01:20:51.426 --> 01:20:53.360
Sam Beckett.

01:21:10.812 --> 01:21:13.747
Jackson hits a towering smash...

01:21:13.815 --> 01:21:17.273
over the Shneck and Shneck billboard
in center field.!

01:21:17.352 --> 01:21:21.789
And the Bombers have pulled
within a run. Ooo-wee.!

01:21:27.196 --> 01:21:29.562
Long distance.

01:21:29.631 --> 01:21:31.565
Long distance?

01:21:31.633 --> 01:21:35.262
Yes, I'd like to call
a John Beckett...

01:21:35.337 --> 01:21:38.500
in Elk Ridge, Indiana.

01:21:38.574 --> 01:21:40.974
And I-I-I don't have the number.

01:21:41.043 --> 01:21:43.102
John Beckett?

01:21:43.178 --> 01:21:46.545
Yes, ma'am. Beckett.
One moment, please.

01:21:53.889 --> 01:21:55.880
Hello?

01:21:58.994 --> 01:22:00.723
Dad?

01:22:00.796 --> 01:22:06.632
What? Who is this?
Hello? Hello?

01:22:06.702 --> 01:22:09.603
Look, whoever this is,
I got no time for tomfoolery.

01:22:09.671 --> 01:22:11.332
Please, don't hang up.

01:22:11.406 --> 01:22:13.397
Who is this?

01:22:15.344 --> 01:22:18.780
I- I'm a Beckett.

01:22:18.847 --> 01:22:22.305
My father and your father
are related.

01:22:22.384 --> 01:22:24.375
How?

01:22:25.587 --> 01:22:30.115
Uh, they're brothers.

01:22:30.192 --> 01:22:32.183
I'm John's son.

01:22:32.261 --> 01:22:36.789
John's son? My God, he moved to
Australia when I was just a kid.

01:22:36.865 --> 01:22:39.993
Huh! Listen to me telling you
what your father did.

01:22:40.068 --> 01:22:42.036
That's all right.

01:22:42.104 --> 01:22:46.097
What's your name?
Sam.

01:22:46.174 --> 01:22:49.666
Well, I'll be darned.
I've named my boy Sam.

01:22:49.745 --> 01:22:53.374
How about that?
You don't sound Australian, Sam.

01:22:53.448 --> 01:22:56.576
Well, I-I-I travel a lot.

01:23:00.455 --> 01:23:02.685
I don't believe it.!

01:23:02.758 --> 01:23:05.727
Flash hit a stand-up double.

01:23:07.562 --> 01:23:10.190
I don't want to disappoint
my dad, but I...

01:23:10.265 --> 01:23:13.530
I don't think I'm gonna be able to
make it home for Thanksgiving this year.

01:23:13.602 --> 01:23:17.003
Well, I know he'll understand.
I hope so.

01:23:17.072 --> 01:23:20.166
It doesn't mean I don't love him.
I do, and I miss him a lot too,

01:23:20.242 --> 01:23:22.233
even...

01:23:24.446 --> 01:23:27.040
even if I never...
I never told him.

01:23:27.115 --> 01:23:29.345
He knows.
You think so?

01:23:29.418 --> 01:23:33.514
Well, a boy can't feel about his dad
the way you do without his knowing it.

01:23:36.091 --> 01:23:37.956
Maybe.

01:23:38.026 --> 01:23:42.463
But when I don't show for Thanksgiving,
it's-it's gonna hurt him.

01:23:42.531 --> 01:23:46.831
Sam, it's nice to have
the children home for the holidays,

01:23:46.902 --> 01:23:50.235
but sometimes
it can't happen.

01:23:50.305 --> 01:23:53.274
You're a young man trying to
make your mark in the world, and...

01:23:53.342 --> 01:23:55.529
how you go about doing
that's a lot more important

01:23:55.530 --> 01:23:58.370
to your father than
showing up for turkey.

01:23:58.447 --> 01:24:00.574
At least
it would be for me.

01:24:03.785 --> 01:24:06.948
Coming from you, that means...
that means a lot.

01:24:07.022 --> 01:24:09.923
Now you can't make it
to Australia for the holidays,

01:24:09.991 --> 01:24:13.324
but... we're a lot closer.

01:24:13.395 --> 01:24:16.057
Why don't you come up here?
We got plenty of room,

01:24:16.131 --> 01:24:21.091
and Mom's pumpkin pie has taken a blue ribbon
at the Elk Ridge County Fair for ten years.

01:24:22.604 --> 01:24:26.233
Well, I don't know
if I'll be able to, but I'm...

01:24:26.308 --> 01:24:28.276
I'm sure gonna try.

01:24:28.343 --> 01:24:31.608
Well, it doesn't have to be
Thanksgiving either.

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.649
You wanna drop by here
anytime, you're welcome.

01:24:37.252 --> 01:24:39.243
I'll remember that.

01:24:43.692 --> 01:24:46.456
Good-bye.

01:24:46.528 --> 01:24:48.519
I love you, Dad.

01:25:04.613 --> 01:25:07.138
Hey, Dad, that calf
is gonna drop any second.

01:25:07.215 --> 01:25:10.048
I'll get my sweater, Sam.

01:25:10.118 --> 01:25:13.679
I just talked to
my Uncle John's son from Australia.

01:25:13.755 --> 01:25:15.723
He may come for the holidays.

01:25:15.791 --> 01:25:17.850
Can he milk cows?

01:25:19.594 --> 01:25:21.528
Come on.

01:25:40.882 --> 01:25:42.975
Thank you.

01:25:59.835 --> 01:26:02.895
You know, maybe this quantum leaping...

01:26:02.971 --> 01:26:05.098
isn't such a bad deal after all.

01:26:05.173 --> 01:26:07.107
Getting a second chance
to put things right,

01:26:07.175 --> 01:26:11.373
to make the world a better place.

01:26:11.446 --> 01:26:14.279
Who knows what I can accomplish
before I'm done.

01:26:29.865 --> 01:26:31.856
Thanks, Al.

01:26:35.170 --> 01:26:38.606
Go fly out.

01:26:38.673 --> 01:26:41.801
I don't know, Al.
Maybe I'm here to win this one.

01:26:45.514 --> 01:26:50.417
The tying run is on second, and the
potential winning run is coming up to bat!

01:26:50.485 --> 01:26:56.446
Hey, Fox!
Tim, this is my last year too,

01:26:56.525 --> 01:27:01.258
and, uh, I don't want
to end it in the cellar.

01:27:12.707 --> 01:27:15.267
Go, Foxy! Go, Foxy!

01:27:15.343 --> 01:27:19.575
Foxy! Foxy! Foxy!

01:27:19.648 --> 01:27:22.208
Give me one with
a four-bagger in it, son.

01:27:25.987 --> 01:27:29.684
Go on, Foxy.

01:27:29.758 --> 01:27:32.591
Are you serious, Sam?

01:27:32.661 --> 01:27:35.391
You notice who that kid kind of
looks like out there? Yeah.

01:27:35.463 --> 01:27:38.762
Yeah? Yeah?
You're gonna fly to center.

01:27:38.833 --> 01:27:42.792
Fox flied out to center.
I'm not Fox.

01:27:42.871 --> 01:27:46.102
Yeah, well, you're not Roy Hobbs either.

01:27:52.347 --> 01:27:55.111
Fox, representing the winning run,
steps to the plate.

01:27:55.183 --> 01:28:00.416
A switch-hitter, Fox has 28 home runs
this year, 12 of them batting left-handed.

01:28:04.526 --> 01:28:09.190
Be patient in there now!
Be patient!

01:28:23.278 --> 01:28:26.338
Strike one!

01:28:26.414 --> 01:28:29.906
Well, now, at least there's someone
around here who can follow orders.

01:28:42.897 --> 01:28:45.491
Strike two!

01:28:51.072 --> 01:28:54.940
That last one had to be
over 100 miles an hour.

01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:57.945
I'll get the next one.
Did you ask for time?

01:28:58.013 --> 01:29:00.447
No. Play ball.
All right. Let's go.

01:29:00.515 --> 01:29:02.278
"When it comes to that
final out in life,

01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:06.548
"whether you pop out,
ground out or fly out, remember.

01:29:06.621 --> 01:29:10.990
Shneck and Shneck will always
be there to bring you home. "

01:29:11.059 --> 01:29:13.960
Fox steps back into the box.
He digs in.

01:29:14.029 --> 01:29:19.023
Behind 0 and 2 in the count, he looks
determined not to let another pitch go by.

01:29:58.673 --> 01:30:00.971
Strike three.!
