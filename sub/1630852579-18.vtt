00:02.042 --> 00:02.958
NARRATOR:
Throughout the ancient world,

00:03.083 --> 00:05.583
there were tales of mortals

00:05.708 --> 00:07.208
and immortals.

00:07.333 --> 00:08.917
AMIR HUSSAIN:
In Christian traditions,

00:09.042 --> 00:10.375
in Islamic traditions,

00:10.542 --> 00:12.000
and Hindu traditions,

00:12.125 --> 00:14.333
you have these divine beings
who live forever.

00:14.417 --> 00:18.333
NARRATOR:
Could these stories be
accounts of alien visitors

00:18.458 --> 00:22.500
who traveled to Earth from
thousands of lightyears away?

00:22.625 --> 00:25.250
TRAVIS TAYLOR:
Imagine an advanced civilization

00:25.375 --> 00:27.167
that has interstellar travel.

00:27.333 --> 00:30.500
If they can travel
through the stars, they could

00:30.583 --> 00:33.875
stretch their longevity
maybe even to centuries.

00:34.042 --> 00:36.750
NARRATOR:
And if humans are to one day

00:36.875 --> 00:38.208
colonize other planets,

00:38.333 --> 00:40.167
will we too need to discover

00:40.250 --> 00:42.750
the key to immortality?

00:42.875 --> 00:45.042
DAVID CHILDRESS:
What our extraterrestrial
ancestors

00:45.208 --> 00:46.792
have wanted us to do

00:46.875 --> 00:49.167
is be like them.

00:49.292 --> 00:52.458
They want us to be a spacefaring
race that goes to the stars.

00:52.542 --> 00:55.875
And to live
these extended lives where

00:56.042 --> 00:58.083
we become essentially immortal.

01:01.042 --> 01:02.750
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:02.875 --> 01:05.458
in the universe.

01:05.542 --> 01:08.667
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:09.958 --> 01:12.542
It demands
we question everything

01:12.667 --> 01:15.000
we have ever been taught.

01:15.125 --> 01:18.458
The evidence is all around us.

01:18.583 --> 01:22.500
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:22.625 --> 01:25.208
We are not alone.

01:25.333 --> 01:28.458
We have never been alone.

01:38.667 --> 01:42.125
The Ashmolean Museum
of art and archaeology.

01:43.375 --> 01:46.833
Among the hundreds of
historic artifacts on display

01:46.958 --> 01:50.000
is an ancient
Sumerian cuneiform text.

01:50.125 --> 01:53.500
Dating back to at least
2000 BC,

01:53.667 --> 01:57.292
the four-sided clay document
is a list of kings

01:57.375 --> 02:01.083
who lived far longer than
the average human life span.

02:02.375 --> 02:04.667
In the Ashmolean Museum
at Oxford,

02:04.833 --> 02:06.333
there's an astounding artifact.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.917
It's referred to as WB44,

02:09.042 --> 02:10.750
the Sumerian Kings List.

02:12.417 --> 02:15.792
On one panel, it tells us
about eight kings

02:15.917 --> 02:19.458
that ruled over five cities, and
what's astounding about this

02:19.583 --> 02:22.542
is the length of
the reigns of these kings.

02:22.708 --> 02:27.167
One king is said to have ruled
for 43,200 years.

02:27.292 --> 02:30.917
Another king rules
for 28,000 years.

02:31.042 --> 02:32.458
It's astounding.

02:33.542 --> 02:36.333
NARRATOR:
Curiously,
the Sumerian Kings List

02:36.458 --> 02:38.833
is not the only
ancient record of rulers

02:38.958 --> 02:41.167
who lived for centuries.

02:41.292 --> 02:44.667
A curious document
was found in a tomb

02:44.792 --> 02:46.333
in Luxor,

02:46.458 --> 02:49.750
and it's called the, uh,
Turin Kings List.

02:51.583 --> 02:54.708
We only have fragments
of this document,

02:54.875 --> 02:57.333
but what this document lays out

02:57.500 --> 03:00.417
is that many of the really early

03:00.542 --> 03:03.333
Egyptian pharaohs had lives

03:03.458 --> 03:06.042
that were many
hundreds of years,

03:06.208 --> 03:09.083
and that some
of these pharaohs lived

03:09.208 --> 03:12.417
for 700, 800, 900 years.

03:13.583 --> 03:17.292
We have a similar story
in the Bible of Methuselah

03:17.417 --> 03:19.042
and that he's said to have lived

03:19.167 --> 03:22.500
for 969 years.

03:22.583 --> 03:26.167
So, how is it that
people are able

03:26.292 --> 03:29.250
to live such great ages?

03:30.708 --> 03:32.583
NARRATOR:
Is it merely coincidence

03:32.708 --> 03:35.542
that in three different
ancient traditions

03:35.667 --> 03:37.958
there are records
of their earliest leaders

03:38.083 --> 03:40.333
living impossibly long lives?

03:41.208 --> 03:45.167
Curiously,
in all three cultures, it was

03:45.292 --> 03:48.208
also recorded that, during
the time when people lived

03:48.375 --> 03:51.500
to these incredible ages,
humans shared the Earth

03:51.667 --> 03:54.542
with beings who came down
from the sky.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.083
The ancient Egyptians
referred to

03:58.208 --> 04:00.500
a-a time called the first time,

04:00.625 --> 04:03.708
when the gods walked among men.

04:04.958 --> 04:08.500
Ancient Egyptian creation
mythology tells us that these

04:08.583 --> 04:12.583
original god beings
came from the stars.

04:12.708 --> 04:15.250
This sounds very much like
the arrival of the Anunnaki,

04:15.375 --> 04:18.500
the divine lords of light
of the Sumerian tradition

04:18.583 --> 04:22.417
when they arrived
atop Mount Kerzok.

04:22.542 --> 04:25.500
It's also virtually identical
to the arrival of the Watchers.

04:25.625 --> 04:29.208
The Watchers are the angels

04:29.333 --> 04:31.000
of the Old Testament.

04:31.125 --> 04:34.125
They are the fallen angels

04:34.208 --> 04:35.500
who came to Earth

04:35.625 --> 04:38.000
and intermingled with humans.

04:41.167 --> 04:43.208
NARRATOR:
The Watchers, like divine beings

04:43.375 --> 04:45.292
in many other ancient cultures,

04:45.375 --> 04:48.667
were referred to as immortals,
but often

04:48.750 --> 04:52.458
they were described as having
very humanlike traits.

04:53.292 --> 04:55.167
There were 200
of these Watchers,

04:55.250 --> 04:57.500
and they were led by, uh,

04:57.667 --> 04:59.667
an individual named Samyaza.

04:59.792 --> 05:01.833
They shone.

05:01.917 --> 05:03.667
There was a translucence.

05:03.792 --> 05:07.333
There was an aura about them
that was as bright as the Sun.

05:07.500 --> 05:11.250
But they seem to be more human
in their appetites

05:11.375 --> 05:13.917
than one would like to believe.

05:14.042 --> 05:15.417
They're hungry, they eat,

05:15.542 --> 05:17.375
they want affection, they lust.

05:18.708 --> 05:22.250
I think that the Watchers
most definitely

05:22.375 --> 05:25.167
are extraterrestrials
who came to Earth.

05:25.333 --> 05:28.875
Countless ancient,
original cultures

05:29.042 --> 05:32.000
speak of a time when the gods

05:32.125 --> 05:33.833
descended from the sky

05:33.917 --> 05:37.500
and mingled with people
to impart their knowledge.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.917
Ancient Egypt,

05:40.042 --> 05:41.708
ancient China,

05:41.833 --> 05:43.375
ancient Sumeria,

05:43.500 --> 05:45.083
ancient Japan,

05:45.208 --> 05:47.083
ancient Greece.

05:47.208 --> 05:49.333
And so, I think
the different cultures

05:49.458 --> 05:52.167
were visited
by the same teachers,

05:52.250 --> 05:53.500
who were extraterrestrials.

05:53.583 --> 05:55.500
NARRATOR:
Could it be

05:55.625 --> 05:58.000
that the earliest
human civilizations

05:58.083 --> 06:01.625
shared the Earth with visitors
from another world?

06:01.750 --> 06:02.917
And if so,

06:03.042 --> 06:05.667
is this somehow connected
to the ancient records

06:05.792 --> 06:09.708
of people who lived
extraordinarily long lives?

06:10.833 --> 06:14.167
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest an important clue

06:14.292 --> 06:16.458
can be found in a famous verse

06:16.542 --> 06:19.667
from the Bible that
is often mistranslated.

06:19.792 --> 06:22.625
In many English versions
of the Book of Genesis,

06:22.750 --> 06:25.458
chapter one, verse 27 states

06:25.542 --> 06:28.958
that "God created man
in his own image."

06:29.083 --> 06:30.958
But in the original Hebrew,

06:31.083 --> 06:34.667
instead of "his" image,
it says "our" image.

06:35.708 --> 06:39.500
God says in Genesis,
"Let us make man in our image."

06:39.583 --> 06:41.792
Well, you have to say,
"Well, who is 'our'?

06:41.917 --> 06:43.625
Who-who are the
other people there?"

06:44.708 --> 06:48.500
Well, the word "God"
in Hebrew is "Elohim,"

06:48.625 --> 06:51.000
and that is plural.

06:51.125 --> 06:53.833
TSOUKALOS:
If you look at
the original Hebrew

06:53.958 --> 06:56.458
in which the sentence
was written,

06:56.542 --> 06:59.667
all of a sudden
you have the truth

06:59.750 --> 07:02.542
because, according to
the ancient astronaut theory,

07:02.667 --> 07:06.000
someone came
and someone altered our DNA

07:06.125 --> 07:07.792
in order for us

07:07.875 --> 07:09.333
to become humans

07:09.458 --> 07:12.875
and essentially gave us
more intelligence.

07:14.708 --> 07:16.583
ERICH VON DÄNIKEN:
Practically every culture,

07:16.708 --> 07:19.333
including our Bible, says,
"In the beginning,

07:19.500 --> 07:21.417
God," in the plurals, "created

07:21.542 --> 07:25.292
humans according
their own image."

07:25.417 --> 07:27.250
I'm a deep believer in God,

07:27.375 --> 07:29.667
but God is something gigantic,

07:29.792 --> 07:32.333
spiritual, not explainable.

07:32.458 --> 07:35.333
In my opinion,
when you read the Bible,

07:35.458 --> 07:38.667
it's all about
extraterrestrials.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.667
Part of ancient astronaut theory

07:40.750 --> 07:44.042
is that what
our extraterrestrial

07:44.208 --> 07:46.292
ancestors have wanted us to do

07:46.375 --> 07:48.167
is be like them.

07:49.667 --> 07:51.542
They want us to achieve

07:51.708 --> 07:54.458
the same things
that they achieved.

07:55.333 --> 07:58.500
The goal was,
some thousands of years

07:58.667 --> 08:00.208
in the far future,

08:00.375 --> 08:03.875
this humanity should be able
to construct spaceships

08:04.000 --> 08:06.583
to spread out
in the universe again.

08:10.208 --> 08:13.500
NARRATOR:
If <i>Homo sapiens</i> were
genetically engineered

08:13.583 --> 08:15.667
by extraterrestrial
space travelers

08:15.833 --> 08:17.500
to one day become like them

08:17.625 --> 08:20.250
and seed life on other planets,

08:20.375 --> 08:24.167
what might this mean for
the future of the human race?

08:24.250 --> 08:28.333
Some experts have suggested
that interstellar travel

08:28.417 --> 08:31.833
will only be possible
when science finds a way

08:31.958 --> 08:35.458
to dramatically extend
the human life span.

08:35.542 --> 08:37.750
TAYLOR:
Maybe our generation,

08:37.875 --> 08:39.750
with new developments
in technologies,

08:39.875 --> 08:42.792
will be living
to the mid-100s, 150,

08:42.875 --> 08:45.667
maybe even up to 200
in the next few decades.

08:45.792 --> 08:48.750
So, imagine
an advanced civilization

08:48.875 --> 08:51.000
that has interstellar travel.

08:51.125 --> 08:53.917
Certainly, if they can travel
through the stars,

08:54.042 --> 08:57.583
they could stretch
their longevity

08:57.708 --> 08:59.750
maybe even to centuries.

09:01.542 --> 09:04.458
NARRATOR:
Could it be that
the ancient people

09:04.542 --> 09:06.542
referred to the gods
as "immortals"

09:06.708 --> 09:08.667
because they encountered
space travelers

09:08.792 --> 09:11.042
who lived
for thousands of years?

09:11.208 --> 09:13.208
And if so,

09:13.375 --> 09:15.333
is it possible
that there are records

09:15.500 --> 09:17.833
of early rulers
living for centuries

09:18.000 --> 09:22.167
because these visitors somehow
extended their life spans?

09:23.250 --> 09:26.167
RABBI ARIEL BAR TZADOK:
It was natural for people

09:26.250 --> 09:27.792
in those days

09:27.875 --> 09:31.792
to live a life close
to a thousand years,

09:31.875 --> 09:35.292
but we're talking
about those who interacted

09:35.375 --> 09:38.583
with these beings
from the stars.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.500
Are these things connected?

09:41.625 --> 09:44.667
HENRY:
We're talking about an age
in which otherworldly beings

09:44.833 --> 09:47.167
assist humankind in becoming

09:47.292 --> 09:50.000
very much like the gods.

09:51.208 --> 09:54.667
NARRATOR:
But if our ancestors
from deep antiquity

09:54.833 --> 09:58.750
were so close to becoming like
their extraterrestrial creators,

09:58.875 --> 10:01.542
as ancient astronaut
theorists suggest,

10:01.708 --> 10:05.083
what kept them
from realizing this destiny?

10:05.208 --> 10:08.792
And are humans today
still on the same path?

10:08.917 --> 10:11.208
Perhaps further clues
can be found

10:11.333 --> 10:14.292
by examining a story
shared by different cultures

10:14.417 --> 10:16.167
all over the world,

10:16.333 --> 10:19.000
the story of the Great Flood.

10:24.042 --> 10:26.292
NARRATOR:
The Bible's Book of Genesis.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.875
In chapter six, verse nine

10:29.000 --> 10:31.667
begins the story of Noah
and the flood,

10:31.792 --> 10:35.125
in which God
sends a great deluge

10:35.250 --> 10:39.000
to cleanse the Earth,
which has become overrun by sin.

10:40.042 --> 10:43.042
It is one of the most
well-known tales from the Bible,

10:43.167 --> 10:46.542
but, curiously,
nearly identical stories

10:46.708 --> 10:49.958
exist in dozens of
other ancient traditions.

10:50.875 --> 10:53.667
BILL BIRNES:
We've heard about
the flood of Noah,

10:53.792 --> 10:56.833
which wiped out that
whole generation and brought

10:56.917 --> 11:00.083
about a new generation
of descendants of Noah.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.542
The fact is,

11:01.667 --> 11:04.667
there's all these stories
of the Great Flood

11:04.750 --> 11:07.042
in all countries
across the world.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.833
Plato talked about Atlantis.

11:10.917 --> 11:13.667
He talked about
a whole civilization

11:13.750 --> 11:16.333
destroyed by floods.

11:16.417 --> 11:17.500
In the Bible,

11:17.625 --> 11:20.333
Turkey, in Egypt,

11:20.458 --> 11:22.250
among the Native Americans,

11:22.375 --> 11:24.000
there's a story

11:24.125 --> 11:27.417
that the Great Flood wrapped
around the entire planet.

11:27.542 --> 11:29.750
All life was destroyed.

11:29.875 --> 11:31.750
The connection between
the biblical story

11:31.875 --> 11:34.875
of the Great Flood
and the destruction

11:35.000 --> 11:38.917
of other societies
around the world

11:39.042 --> 11:41.708
through floods
tell us one thing.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.542
There actually was
a Great Flood

11:43.667 --> 11:46.000
and that, at one point

11:46.125 --> 11:47.833
in the history of this planet,

11:47.958 --> 11:50.167
all life was wiped out

11:50.292 --> 11:54.250
as the Earth
was covered in water.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.833
VON DÄNIKEN:
In all mythologies,
including the Bible,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
some gods are coming down

12:01.083 --> 12:03.500
and teach the human
a great flood

12:03.625 --> 12:04.875
will come and destroy you.

12:05.042 --> 12:08.708
And these god,
they knew it long before,

12:08.833 --> 12:11.000
and they knew it because

12:11.125 --> 12:14.083
they themselves
made the Great Flood.

12:15.250 --> 12:19.417
The Great Flood was created
by extraterrestrials on purpose.

12:20.542 --> 12:22.792
NARRATOR:
Could the story
of the Great Flood

12:22.875 --> 12:25.125
be a historical record
of a real event

12:25.208 --> 12:28.667
that was brought on
by extraterrestrials?

12:28.792 --> 12:32.125
But if the ancient
astronaut theory is correct,

12:32.208 --> 12:36.167
and aliens genetically
engineered humankind,

12:36.292 --> 12:39.750
why would they then destroy
their greatest creation?

12:41.208 --> 12:44.500
TZADOK:
We have the records, as
described in the Book of Enoch

12:44.625 --> 12:46.000
and other literature,

12:46.125 --> 12:49.167
that the Watchers led
to the moral corruption

12:49.333 --> 12:51.000
of all humanity,

12:51.125 --> 12:54.375
which led to the destruction
of the face of the Earth.

12:54.542 --> 12:58.042
They were introducing
hidden technologies

12:58.167 --> 13:01.000
centuries before they were meant
to be introduced.

13:01.125 --> 13:03.833
They corrupted
the human gene pool.

13:03.958 --> 13:06.667
CARTER:
In Genesis six,

13:06.750 --> 13:08.917
we hear about the sons of God.

13:09.042 --> 13:11.167
They see the daughters of men,

13:11.292 --> 13:14.042
and they lust after them,
and they come down,

13:14.167 --> 13:17.500
and they take them as wives.

13:17.625 --> 13:21.542
And then they create a hybrid
race called the Nephilim.

13:21.708 --> 13:25.167
You weren't supposed to
fraternize with the natives,

13:25.250 --> 13:28.667
but this is what we
are told in the Bible.

13:28.792 --> 13:30.875
Now, what are we to make
of these texts?

13:31.042 --> 13:33.708
Are we to say,
"Well, maybe these angels,

13:33.833 --> 13:35.375
"these sons of God,
did they have sex

13:35.500 --> 13:37.000
the old-fashioned way?"

13:37.125 --> 13:39.167
We don't know,
but we need to start

13:39.292 --> 13:43.583
looking at these stories
from a 21st century perspective.

13:44.625 --> 13:48.583
With the technology that
we have with genetic engineering

13:48.708 --> 13:50.292
and splicing genes
and what have you,

13:50.417 --> 13:53.167
maybe we can revisit
this story and look

13:53.250 --> 13:55.833
at it from maybe
an extraterrestrial,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.917
uh, hypothesis or point of view.

13:58.042 --> 14:01.208
They're creating a hybrid race.

14:01.333 --> 14:04.250
The DNA of the
off-world intelligence

14:04.375 --> 14:05.708
and the human DNA

14:05.875 --> 14:08.167
creates this hybrid race,
and most

14:08.333 --> 14:11.750
of these beings,
for better or for worse,

14:11.875 --> 14:15.000
had what we could call
superhuman powers.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.333
NARRATOR:
As far as ancient
astronaut theorists

14:18.458 --> 14:22.000
are concerned,
a genetic upgrade occurred.

14:22.083 --> 14:26.000
One that closed the gap
between mortals and immortals

14:26.083 --> 14:28.333
far more quickly
than was intended.

14:28.417 --> 14:31.708
And it is a story that,
once again,

14:31.833 --> 14:34.500
was told across many cultures.

14:35.458 --> 14:38.125
When the sons of God
procreated with

14:38.208 --> 14:39.833
the daughters of men,
it is said that

14:40.000 --> 14:42.833
mighty ones were born.

14:42.958 --> 14:45.833
They had a longer
life span as well,

14:45.917 --> 14:47.792
dating maybe centuries,

14:47.917 --> 14:50.333
up to a thousand years--
not immortal

14:50.417 --> 14:53.875
but a life span much,
much longer than ours.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.208
CHILDRESS:
When you look back at
ancient Egyptian history,

14:58.333 --> 15:01.542
the pharaohs themselves
were said to be demigods.

15:03.125 --> 15:06.000
Part-god, part-human.

15:06.083 --> 15:09.167
JONATHAN YOUNG:
This was present
in the Greek imagination.

15:09.292 --> 15:12.125
The Olympians were known
to get involved in the world

15:12.250 --> 15:14.375
of the mortals, and they
would intervene sometimes.

15:14.542 --> 15:17.083
Sometimes they would
get attracted to a mortal

15:17.208 --> 15:19.667
and children would come.
Hercules, Perseus.

15:19.792 --> 15:23.542
These are the offspring,
demigods, half-god, half-human.

15:23.708 --> 15:26.667
NARRATOR:
But in many
of the ancient stories,

15:26.833 --> 15:30.375
the gods who were responsible
for this upgrade of humanity

15:30.500 --> 15:34.042
were acting against the wishes
of their superiors.

15:34.167 --> 15:37.958
They were not just helping
to jumpstart human civilization

15:38.083 --> 15:41.500
but creating
a new race of immortals.

15:41.583 --> 15:45.292
CARTER:
Enoch, who's the scribe of God,

15:45.417 --> 15:49.333
says that these angels
went against the will of God.

15:49.458 --> 15:52.792
Now, you can imagine
those angels were

15:52.875 --> 15:55.167
extraterrestrial in origin.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.833
If there was a prime directive,
they violated it.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.250
They gave us gifts,

16:00.375 --> 16:03.583
and we weren't ready
for those gifts.

16:03.708 --> 16:05.917
It's like giving
a gun to a baby.

16:06.042 --> 16:07.292
Nothing good will happen.

16:07.375 --> 16:09.667
HENRY:
Maybe the extraterrestrials

16:09.750 --> 16:11.167
were protecting humanity,

16:11.292 --> 16:13.750
and humanity is considered
a sacred project,

16:13.875 --> 16:17.500
and they know that, while they
begun it thousands of years ago,

16:17.583 --> 16:20.583
it would take thousands
or perhaps tens of thousands

16:20.708 --> 16:24.167
of years for humanity to reach
its ultimate fulfillment,

16:24.292 --> 16:26.208
but they were
committed ultimately

16:26.333 --> 16:29.042
to the sacredness or
the fulfillment of the project.

16:29.167 --> 16:32.667
And this is why
they restarted civilization.

16:33.625 --> 16:36.500
NARRATOR:
As far as ancient
astronaut theorists

16:36.625 --> 16:40.083
are concerned,
the story of Noah and his family

16:40.208 --> 16:41.792
being saved from the flood

16:41.875 --> 16:44.333
shows that Earth's
extraterrestrial

16:44.417 --> 16:48.500
visitors did not abandon
their plan for humankind.

16:48.625 --> 16:52.542
As further evidence,
they cite a 2,000-year-old text

16:52.667 --> 16:56.167
called the Zohar,
that continues the Biblical

16:56.250 --> 16:58.917
story of the Watchers
after the cataclysm

16:59.042 --> 17:01.500
that ended the previous age
of humans.

17:01.625 --> 17:03.583
TZADOK:
The Zohar says that
there's a great secret

17:03.708 --> 17:07.250
about the angels who walked
with us on Earth.

17:08.417 --> 17:10.167
The Watchers.

17:10.292 --> 17:13.625
They ascended to the stars,

17:13.750 --> 17:15.167
and they are the ones who

17:15.292 --> 17:18.333
come back and shepherd us,

17:18.500 --> 17:20.083
watch over us.

17:20.208 --> 17:22.458
They watch over humanity

17:22.542 --> 17:26.292
and direct the course
of our civilization.

17:27.208 --> 17:29.000
TSOUKALOS:
I think that
the extraterrestrials

17:29.167 --> 17:31.125
never left. Why?

17:31.208 --> 17:34.167
Because, according to the
ancient astronaut theory,

17:34.333 --> 17:36.750
we are their offspring.

17:36.875 --> 17:40.333
They made us <i>Homo sapiens
sapiens,</i> what we are today.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.583
If you have such a creation,

17:42.708 --> 17:46.125
I don't think you
would just abandon that.

17:46.208 --> 17:49.417
We are a long-term project.

17:50.708 --> 17:54.208
NARRATOR:
If the first humans shared
the planet with alien visitors,

17:54.333 --> 17:56.875
as ancient astronaut
theorists suggest,

17:57.000 --> 17:58.792
is it possible that

17:58.875 --> 18:02.500
these otherworldly beings have
remained on Earth for thousands

18:02.583 --> 18:06.875
of years, continuing to direct
the course of humanity?

18:07.042 --> 18:10.042
And if humans were
designed to ultimately

18:10.208 --> 18:14.167
achieve immortality,
just how will that happen?

18:15.167 --> 18:18.167
Perhaps further clues
can be found by examining

18:18.292 --> 18:20.458
a strange substance discovered

18:20.542 --> 18:23.375
on Easter Island.

18:29.375 --> 18:32.708
NARRATOR: Lying over 2,000 miles
off the coast of Chile,

18:32.833 --> 18:36.458
this remote landmass is famous
for the nearly 1,000

18:36.583 --> 18:39.292
monolithic stone statues
called moai

18:39.417 --> 18:41.833
found along its coastline.

18:41.917 --> 18:43.833
For ancient astronaut theorists,

18:43.958 --> 18:45.500
the enormous statues,

18:45.625 --> 18:47.875
along with the
local legends that say

18:48.000 --> 18:49.542
they represent giant beings

18:49.667 --> 18:52.500
who came down from the sky,
present a compelling case

18:52.625 --> 18:54.375
for Easter Island being a place

18:54.542 --> 18:58.167
of extraterrestrial visitation.

18:58.333 --> 19:01.125
And what has made
this notion even more

19:01.208 --> 19:04.500
intriguing is the discovery
that the island's soil

19:04.625 --> 19:07.708
contains a substance
called rapamycin

19:07.875 --> 19:11.542
that might be able to extend
the human life span.

19:13.042 --> 19:14.750
In 1968, a remarkable

19:14.875 --> 19:18.042
substance was found,
a kind of bacterial substance

19:18.167 --> 19:20.292
called rapamycin,
and it was given that name

19:20.375 --> 19:22.375
because it was found
on Rapa Nui, or Easter Island,

19:22.542 --> 19:24.708
which in itself
is very interesting.

19:25.833 --> 19:28.458
And what they found was
it could actually help

19:28.583 --> 19:31.125
when people had
organ transplants

19:31.208 --> 19:33.250
to stop them rejecting them,

19:33.375 --> 19:36.375
but it could also help
in cancer therapies as well.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.958
Then they found that it had very
strong anti-aging properties.

19:39.083 --> 19:44.042
It would almost reverse aging
in certain medical situations.

19:44.167 --> 19:47.208
NARRATOR:
Rapamycin has already been shown

19:47.375 --> 19:50.583
to extend life span
and improve health in mice,

19:50.708 --> 19:52.750
and in 2018,

19:52.875 --> 19:54.708
researchers at Texas A&M

19:54.833 --> 19:57.667
began testing
the substance on dogs.

19:57.833 --> 20:00.583
While there is still much
to learn about the effects

20:00.708 --> 20:01.917
of rapamycin,

20:02.042 --> 20:03.708
scientists are hopeful that it

20:03.833 --> 20:06.000
could prove to actually
reverse aging

20:06.125 --> 20:08.000
on a cellular level.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.208
Is it a coincidence
that rapamycin

20:10.333 --> 20:12.292
was found on Easter Island?

20:12.375 --> 20:15.000
Where there's possible
alien visitations?

20:15.083 --> 20:17.750
We don't know. In fact,
one question to ask is, what

20:17.875 --> 20:19.917
do the aliens do to live

20:20.042 --> 20:23.000
very long lives themselves?
Do they take certain substances?

20:23.167 --> 20:27.292
NARRATOR:
Could it be that
the anti-aging substance found

20:27.417 --> 20:31.250
on Easter Island was
left behind by alien visitors

20:31.375 --> 20:35.333
who used it as a way
to extend their life spans?

20:35.458 --> 20:37.792
In numerous ancient traditions,

20:37.875 --> 20:40.792
there are stories of the gods
possessing elixirs

20:40.917 --> 20:42.375
of immortality

20:42.500 --> 20:45.958
and sometimes sharing them
with humans.

20:47.042 --> 20:49.917
There are many ancient cultures

20:50.042 --> 20:53.583
that had their own
food and drink

20:53.708 --> 20:56.250
that could bring immortality.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.667
For instance, in China,

20:58.750 --> 21:01.667
there was the peaches
of immortality

21:01.792 --> 21:05.833
that were given out
by the goddess known as

21:05.917 --> 21:08.250
the Old Mother of the West.

21:08.375 --> 21:12.167
These were given
to the immortals of China

21:12.250 --> 21:15.250
to quite literally
allow them to live

21:15.375 --> 21:17.833
for eternity.

21:17.958 --> 21:21.500
HUSSAIN:
For the Greeks,
it's this nectar ambrosia,

21:21.625 --> 21:24.583
literally the food of the gods,
that, if you consume that,

21:24.708 --> 21:27.542
then you yourself
will be divine.

21:27.667 --> 21:29.167
In the Vedas,
you have this drink--

21:29.292 --> 21:31.500
uh, soma--
and the same idea,

21:31.667 --> 21:33.375
that this is what feeds the gods

21:33.500 --> 21:35.958
and keeps them
alive and immortal.

21:36.083 --> 21:38.458
Then, if we humans
eat that food,

21:38.542 --> 21:41.542
these substances will
keep us alive forever.

21:42.708 --> 21:46.792
NARRATOR:
If these gods were,
in fact, alien visitors,

21:46.917 --> 21:50.208
could it be that they
were able to achieve immortality

21:50.375 --> 21:54.292
simply by ingesting
some type of plant or drug?

21:54.417 --> 21:58.792
Some ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that substances,

21:58.917 --> 22:02.000
like ambrosia, were merely
symbolic devices

22:02.083 --> 22:05.417
representing the gods' ability
to extend their lives.

22:05.542 --> 22:09.625
And they believe this
was accomplished using the same

22:09.708 --> 22:13.250
technology that scientists
are developing today,

22:13.375 --> 22:15.000
gene splicing.

22:23.042 --> 22:27.250
A team of scientists working
with a gene-manipulating

22:27.375 --> 22:29.458
technology known as CRISPR

22:29.542 --> 22:32.625
at the Broad Institute
of Harvard and MIT

22:32.750 --> 22:34.458
makes a groundbreaking
discovery.

22:34.542 --> 22:37.792
By editing specific genes
in mice,

22:37.917 --> 22:39.917
the researchers were able

22:40.042 --> 22:43.333
to double the life spans
of their test subjects.

22:43.458 --> 22:45.458
CRISPR, you can think of it like

22:45.583 --> 22:49.167
we can cut and snip out
pieces of our DNA.

22:49.250 --> 22:52.167
And if we can discover,
for example,

22:52.333 --> 22:54.542
part of our genetic code

22:54.708 --> 22:56.500
that has to do with aging,

22:56.625 --> 22:58.583
we can maybe cut it out,

22:58.708 --> 23:01.833
or we can add things
into the genetic code

23:01.958 --> 23:03.917
that might extend life

23:04.042 --> 23:06.500
to potentially create

23:06.625 --> 23:09.667
a human that could live forever.

23:10.875 --> 23:14.167
If we could rewrite
the DNA code,

23:14.292 --> 23:17.792
in principle
we can live forever.

23:19.083 --> 23:23.125
Already we've been able to
slice and dice that for a mouse,

23:23.208 --> 23:26.000
and eventually
we'll do it for a human.

23:27.208 --> 23:31.333
NARRATOR:
While it remains to be seen
if CRISPR technology

23:31.500 --> 23:34.458
will succeed in increasing
the human life span...

23:36.500 --> 23:40.375
...some scientists believe
the key to immortality

23:40.542 --> 23:43.667
may be found by studying
a strange sea creature

23:43.792 --> 23:46.750
that has the ability
to live forever.

23:47.917 --> 23:49.750
So, one thing
in nature that seems

23:49.875 --> 23:52.125
to be immortal
is the immortal jellyfish,

23:52.208 --> 23:55.375
where it can actually revert
to an earlier state

23:55.500 --> 23:57.542
when damaged or at risk

23:57.708 --> 24:00.042
and then regrow back
into the adult state.

24:02.042 --> 24:05.333
NARRATOR:
The cells of all animals
begin as stem cells,

24:05.458 --> 24:08.875
which then develop
into organs, muscles, bones,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.375
and whatever else
the organism needs.

24:11.500 --> 24:14.958
The jellyfish species
<i>Turritopsis dohrnii,</i>

24:15.083 --> 24:17.667
commonly known as
the immortal jellyfish,

24:17.792 --> 24:19.667
can take mature adult cells

24:19.750 --> 24:22.583
and turn them back
into stem cells,

24:22.708 --> 24:25.417
allowing the jellyfish
to, in effect,

24:25.542 --> 24:28.500
start its development all over.

24:28.583 --> 24:31.167
So you're really
reversing the biological

24:31.250 --> 24:34.167
timeline and then
resetting it going forward,

24:34.292 --> 24:36.167
so that you're actually
not only living longer

24:36.333 --> 24:37.625
but you're also younger.

24:37.708 --> 24:40.708
And thinking about
how these things

24:40.833 --> 24:43.125
get reversed, to me,
is an intriguing way

24:43.208 --> 24:46.750
to approach the biology
and the immortality.

24:47.667 --> 24:49.333
NARRATOR:
By understanding species

24:49.458 --> 24:51.333
like the immortal jellyfish

24:51.458 --> 24:54.000
and through the technology
of gene editing,

24:54.083 --> 24:57.125
might we greatly extend
the human life span?

24:58.125 --> 25:01.333
And could
extraterrestrials have used

25:01.458 --> 25:03.875
similar means
to achieve immortality,

25:04.000 --> 25:07.667
allowing them to travel
great distances through space?

25:07.833 --> 25:10.042
TSOUKALOS:
It often seems to me

25:10.208 --> 25:11.958
that we live in a time

25:12.042 --> 25:13.500
of rediscovery,

25:13.583 --> 25:16.958
meaning that the fact that we

25:17.083 --> 25:20.083
come up with ways
with which to improve

25:20.208 --> 25:22.208
and prolong our lives,

25:22.333 --> 25:27.125
extraterrestrials have
figured that out long ago.

25:28.500 --> 25:32.167
NARRATOR:
But while scientists
are optimistic that the human

25:32.250 --> 25:35.833
life span can be lengthened
through genetic engineering,

25:35.917 --> 25:39.333
many aerospace experts
believe that biological

25:39.458 --> 25:41.542
bodies are simply not equipped

25:41.667 --> 25:45.333
to withstand the rigors
of extended space travel.

25:45.417 --> 25:47.500
They suggest that,

25:47.625 --> 25:49.667
if humans
are to one day colonize

25:49.750 --> 25:52.917
other planets,
it will require merging man

25:53.042 --> 25:55.208
and machine.

26:05.958 --> 26:09.667
NARRATOR:
In a press conference organized
by a UFO investigative group

26:09.792 --> 26:12.458
called the Disclosure Project,

26:12.542 --> 26:14.833
former Army Sergeant
Clifford Stone

26:14.917 --> 26:16.750
makes a shocking announcement.

26:16.875 --> 26:20.917
He claims to be part of
a top secret military unit

26:21.042 --> 26:23.542
once tasked with recovering
extraterrestrial craft

26:23.708 --> 26:26.833
and their pilots
for the U.S. government.

26:27.958 --> 26:30.875
I was involved in
situations where we actually

26:31.042 --> 26:34.542
did recoveries of crashed,
of crashed saucers,

26:34.708 --> 26:37.083
for lack of a better term,
debris thereof.

26:37.208 --> 26:39.542
There were bodies
that were involved with

26:39.667 --> 26:42.958
some of these crashes.
Also, some were alive.

26:43.083 --> 26:45.042
While we were doing
all this, we were telling

26:45.167 --> 26:47.000
the American public
there was nothing to it.

26:47.125 --> 26:48.917
We were telling the world
there was nothing to it.

26:50.708 --> 26:53.042
NARRATOR:
Sergeant Stone
would later describe

26:53.208 --> 26:56.125
a specific mission in which
he learned that the pilot of

26:56.250 --> 27:00.417
an extraterrestrial craft was
"a biological robot."

27:01.542 --> 27:03.500
NEWMAN:
So, what he found was,
is that these so-called

27:03.625 --> 27:06.333
Grey aliens with
the skinny bodies and giant

27:06.458 --> 27:08.458
heads were like
biological robots.

27:08.583 --> 27:09.875
They-they had few organs.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.667
They had all this machinery

27:11.792 --> 27:14.500
and computing inside them,

27:14.625 --> 27:16.333
and he really questioned
what this was all about.

27:16.458 --> 27:19.750
And the conclusion was that
they must have been created

27:19.875 --> 27:23.500
to travel huge distances
from their planet to this planet

27:23.625 --> 27:26.833
because, if they were
just a biological entity,

27:26.958 --> 27:29.792
they simply
would not have survived.

27:29.875 --> 27:32.708
NARRATOR:
Could it be that Earth
is being visited

27:32.875 --> 27:36.125
by alien entities
that are part machine?

27:36.208 --> 27:40.125
Is this why the ancient people
referred to the gods as

27:40.250 --> 27:42.958
immortals, because
they were not entirely

27:43.042 --> 27:46.958
biological beings
and appeared to never age?

27:47.042 --> 27:50.833
As further support
for this notion,

27:50.917 --> 27:52.833
ancient astronaut theorists

27:52.958 --> 27:56.792
point to a strange figure that
appears in 18th century France,

27:56.875 --> 28:01.208
the mysterious
Count de Saint-Germain.

28:01.333 --> 28:03.042
COLLINS:
The Count de Saint-Germain is

28:03.167 --> 28:05.500
probably one of
the most enigmatic

28:05.625 --> 28:07.833
gentlemen of human history.

28:07.917 --> 28:11.042
He was an adventurer,
he was a scientist,

28:11.167 --> 28:13.333
he was a composer.

28:13.417 --> 28:15.417
He knew several languages,

28:15.542 --> 28:18.667
yet, strangely, he always

28:18.833 --> 28:20.542
was the same age

28:20.708 --> 28:22.667
whenever anybody saw him.

28:22.833 --> 28:25.292
ETTINGTON:
One of the most
interesting stories

28:25.375 --> 28:29.000
about the count was that when
he was at a social gathering

28:29.083 --> 28:31.875
he met an old woman,
and the old woman said,

28:32.000 --> 28:35.750
"I met you 60 years ago
when I was a young woman,

28:35.875 --> 28:38.708
and you looked in your 40s then,
same as you do now."

28:38.875 --> 28:40.167
He hadn't aged.

28:41.375 --> 28:44.167
Another thing that people
talk about was that he had

28:44.250 --> 28:47.875
so much knowledge of history
and of science.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.333
He knew a lot
of the leaders and kings.

28:50.417 --> 28:53.083
NARRATOR:
Throughout his
reportedly very long life,

28:53.208 --> 28:56.458
the Count de Saint-Germain
befriended many noblemen

28:56.542 --> 29:00.625
and rulers, who he was believed
to have great influence over.

29:00.750 --> 29:03.667
ETTINGTON:
In the mid-1700s

29:03.750 --> 29:06.250
he was a diplomat
for King Louis XV,

29:06.375 --> 29:09.583
and in the 1760s

29:09.708 --> 29:11.167
he traveled to Russia

29:11.250 --> 29:14.500
and he was complicit
in the overthrow

29:14.583 --> 29:18.750
that put Catherine the Great
in place as the czar of Russia.

29:18.875 --> 29:20.333
HENRY:
It was rumored
that he later advised

29:20.458 --> 29:22.875
the Russian imperial commander
in the war against

29:23.042 --> 29:25.083
the Turks, which the Russians
ultimately won.

29:26.583 --> 29:28.208
COLLINS:
He's supposed to have died

29:28.375 --> 29:31.083
in 1784, but there were

29:31.208 --> 29:33.833
reported sightings of him
just the following year

29:34.000 --> 29:37.708
entering into a Masonic lodge
in France,

29:37.875 --> 29:41.000
where his name was actually
noted there and then.

29:41.833 --> 29:45.625
He was reportedly
at the beheading

29:45.708 --> 29:49.000
of Marie Antoinette
several years later.

29:49.167 --> 29:51.500
And there are many other reports

29:51.625 --> 29:53.250
of his presence

29:53.375 --> 29:56.792
all the way around the world
in the 19th century.

29:56.875 --> 30:01.292
NARRATOR:
In addition to appearing in
historical records long after he

30:01.375 --> 30:04.833
was alleged to have died,
it was said by many who knew

30:04.958 --> 30:07.958
the Count de Saint-Germain
that he had odd habits

30:08.042 --> 30:11.375
and possessed
extraordinary abilities.

30:11.500 --> 30:14.458
One of the strange things about
him were his dietary habits.

30:15.708 --> 30:17.667
He'd sit with other people
as they ate,

30:17.792 --> 30:20.042
but he wouldn't eat with them.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.292
One of Count Saint-Germain's
contacts in the 18th century was

30:24.375 --> 30:28.167
Casanova, who said he had
an ability to melt diamonds,

30:28.292 --> 30:30.833
that he had amazing
abilities and powers.

30:30.917 --> 30:32.917
He thought that
he was an incredible

30:33.042 --> 30:34.667
superhuman type of person.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.333
So, if Saint-Germain

30:37.458 --> 30:39.125
had lived centuries,

30:39.208 --> 30:43.000
and he was an alien
from the past,

30:43.083 --> 30:44.958
certainly when you
look at aliens,

30:45.042 --> 30:48.000
who are thousands of years
in advance of us,

30:48.125 --> 30:51.708
they could have had alterations
genetically or mechanically

30:51.833 --> 30:53.750
that would allow them
to live a very long time.

30:53.875 --> 30:57.833
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that
the Count de Saint-Germain

30:57.958 --> 31:01.500
was an extraterrestrial entity
that was part robotic,

31:01.625 --> 31:04.792
much like the Grey alien
that Sergeant Clifford Stone

31:04.875 --> 31:06.583
claims to have examined?

31:06.708 --> 31:10.792
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that such a scenario

31:10.875 --> 31:14.708
is not so far-fetched
considering that today

31:14.833 --> 31:17.042
we are already creating
robots that are

31:17.208 --> 31:20.000
incredibly humanlike
in their appearance.

31:20.083 --> 31:22.167
One of the most cutting-edge

31:22.250 --> 31:25.708
is a Hanson Robotics
creation named Sophia.

31:25.833 --> 31:28.125
HENRY:
What is absolutely mind-blowing

31:28.250 --> 31:30.750
about Sophia and other
robotic entities is,

31:30.875 --> 31:32.917
it's not hard
to imagine a population

31:33.042 --> 31:36.208
of extraterrestrials creating
humanoid robots

31:36.375 --> 31:38.167
like the ones that
we're building today.

31:38.292 --> 31:41.333
Probably even more advanced.

31:41.500 --> 31:45.792
And it makes a lot of sense
for us to send robots into space

31:45.875 --> 31:47.333
instead of
flesh-and-blood bodies.

31:47.417 --> 31:49.250
If it makes sense for us,
it probably

31:49.375 --> 31:51.958
makes sense for
extraterrestrials as well.

31:53.708 --> 31:56.583
NARRATOR:
If the ancient astronaut
theory is correct

31:56.708 --> 31:59.792
and humankind was created
to follow in the footsteps

31:59.875 --> 32:02.167
of its extraterrestrial
creators,

32:02.292 --> 32:05.875
will that mean merging
man and machine?

32:06.042 --> 32:08.667
According to some scientists,

32:08.792 --> 32:12.583
that process
is already underway.

32:22.042 --> 32:24.708
NARRATOR: Located just
four miles west of the Pentagon

32:24.833 --> 32:26.208
is the headquarters

32:26.375 --> 32:29.500
for the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency,

32:29.625 --> 32:31.167
better known as DARPA.

32:31.250 --> 32:34.667
Since 2002, DARPA has been

32:34.792 --> 32:37.333
investing hundreds
of millions of dollars in its

32:37.417 --> 32:40.917
brain-machine interface program
for the U.S. military.

32:41.042 --> 32:44.042
The technologies
they're developing allow

32:44.167 --> 32:46.292
humans to control
mechanical devices

32:46.417 --> 32:48.333
with their minds.

32:48.458 --> 32:50.375
BERLIN:
There are these brain-computer

32:50.542 --> 32:53.500
interfaces where we can implant
electrodes in the brain.

32:53.625 --> 32:56.500
And, for example, you can
control a prosthetic limb

32:56.625 --> 32:58.000
by just using your thoughts

32:58.083 --> 33:00.083
with these
brain-computer interfaces.

33:00.208 --> 33:02.542
The chip records activation
in your brain.

33:02.667 --> 33:05.542
It sends that information
to a computer, which then

33:05.667 --> 33:09.167
sends that to, let's say,
a prosthetic limb to control it.

33:09.250 --> 33:11.625
This is certainly
a good way to extend lives

33:11.750 --> 33:14.375
when the brain is not
the part that's failing, but

33:14.500 --> 33:16.083
it's the rest of the body
that's failing.

33:16.208 --> 33:19.292
'Cause you can actually
now imagine human,

33:19.375 --> 33:21.583
sort of metal robotic cyborg

33:21.708 --> 33:23.958
combinations where your brain is

33:24.083 --> 33:26.792
now not just controlling
maybe your biological body

33:26.875 --> 33:29.333
but something artificial
and man-made.

33:29.458 --> 33:31.500
You give this technology another

33:31.583 --> 33:34.750
50 years, and we will
appear as god beings

33:34.875 --> 33:37.708
to a person living at the
beginning of the 20th century.

33:38.708 --> 33:41.917
So, let's now look back
at the extraterrestrial

33:42.042 --> 33:44.375
gods of the ancient world.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.333
They must have had at least
the level of technological

33:47.458 --> 33:50.708
sophistication that we are
enjoying and experiencing today,

33:50.833 --> 33:52.958
probably even more advanced.

33:53.083 --> 33:55.375
I think it's fascinating
where we are

33:55.500 --> 33:57.708
in this moment in time because

33:57.833 --> 34:00.708
what if, one day, we can create

34:00.875 --> 34:02.542
artificial human beings?

34:02.708 --> 34:06.917
And, in fact,
we are merely rediscovering

34:07.042 --> 34:10.375
what has happened already
a long time ago.

34:10.500 --> 34:13.000
NARRATOR:
As far as some
ancient astronaut theorists

34:13.125 --> 34:16.083
are concerned,
merging biology and

34:16.208 --> 34:17.958
technology is an important

34:18.042 --> 34:21.375
first step in becoming
like our alien ancestors.

34:21.500 --> 34:25.500
But they believe
the extraterrestrial beings

34:25.583 --> 34:28.000
that people have reported
encountering on Earth

34:28.125 --> 34:30.625
may be merely avatars,

34:30.708 --> 34:32.458
vessels for intelligences

34:32.583 --> 34:35.958
that can move
from one body to another.

34:36.042 --> 34:38.167
HENRY:
What if they're digital beings?

34:38.292 --> 34:41.208
Or light beings?
We have numerous stories

34:41.375 --> 34:44.333
that tell us that
the god beings were

34:44.417 --> 34:48.000
originally light beings that
could then phase into a physical

34:48.167 --> 34:50.542
flesh-and-blood form
and then phase back into

34:50.667 --> 34:53.250
their light body form when
they want to travel the stars.

34:53.375 --> 34:56.167
We hear the story
of the Anunnaki,

34:56.250 --> 34:59.208
the divine lords of light
of the Sumerian tradition...

35:00.167 --> 35:02.417
...or the arrival
of the Watchers,

35:02.542 --> 35:05.500
the lords of light
who descended upon Mount Hermon.

35:06.542 --> 35:10.333
TAYLOR:
The stories of Vishnu
actually describe Vishnu

35:10.500 --> 35:13.667
having many manifestations
of himself as other gods.

35:13.792 --> 35:16.500
He would come to our reality
as a different god.

35:16.625 --> 35:19.333
He came to Earth
many different times as many

35:19.417 --> 35:21.833
different people and had
adventures and activities

35:21.958 --> 35:24.542
and then he would go back
into the heavens as Vishnu.

35:24.667 --> 35:28.167
KAKU:
The aliens could be avatars.

35:28.250 --> 35:30.667
They can withstand all
the rigors of outer space

35:30.792 --> 35:33.625
because they are part biological
and part mechanical

35:33.708 --> 35:37.667
but controlled by
an alien consciousness

35:37.792 --> 35:39.875
in a different star system.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.167
NARRATOR:
While the notion
of a conscious being that

35:43.333 --> 35:47.000
can move from one body to
another may sound far-fetched,

35:47.125 --> 35:49.042
humankind is working towards

35:49.208 --> 35:51.292
realizing this technology
right now

35:51.417 --> 35:54.375
by attempting to map
the human brain.

35:54.542 --> 35:57.708
Whole brain emulation
is the ability

35:57.833 --> 36:02.250
to create a carbon copy
of the brain itself.

36:02.375 --> 36:06.500
Already, by slicing and dicing
the brain of a fruit fly,

36:06.583 --> 36:09.375
we've been able to catalog
all the connections

36:09.500 --> 36:11.167
of a fruit fly's brain

36:11.292 --> 36:14.750
up to 100,000 neurons.

36:14.875 --> 36:19.042
Think about that-- every single
connection of the brain

36:19.167 --> 36:21.833
of a fruit fly mapped
using computers

36:22.000 --> 36:24.500
by slicing and dicing the brain.

36:24.625 --> 36:27.458
Now, the human brain
is much more complicated.

36:27.583 --> 36:30.167
A hundred billion neurons,

36:30.250 --> 36:32.583
with each neuron connected to

36:32.708 --> 36:36.333
10,000 other neurons,
but in principle

36:36.458 --> 36:39.375
that's also possible
to create an exact copy

36:39.542 --> 36:43.542
of the brain to map
every single neuron

36:43.667 --> 36:45.042
of the brain

36:45.167 --> 36:48.875
using transistors
rather than neurons.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.875
And it would, in principle,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.583
be identical to who you are.

36:53.708 --> 36:56.333
It would have access
to all your memories,

36:56.417 --> 36:59.167
all your dreams,
all your foibles,

36:59.250 --> 37:01.167
all your mannerisms.

37:01.333 --> 37:03.333
It'll take, of course, decades

37:03.417 --> 37:07.083
to give you that kind of
accuracy, but it is doable.

37:08.292 --> 37:11.583
NARRATOR:
Once scientists can completely
replicate a human brain

37:11.708 --> 37:13.750
through whole brain emulation,

37:13.875 --> 37:17.458
then that information
can be uploaded to a computer

37:17.542 --> 37:21.333
to digitally represent
a person's consciousness.

37:21.417 --> 37:25.167
Could it be that
extraterrestrials who already

37:25.292 --> 37:28.000
possess this capability
have come to Earth

37:28.125 --> 37:32.375
by uploading their consciousness
into artificial bodies?

37:32.500 --> 37:35.375
There are some
theoretical physicists

37:35.542 --> 37:38.000
who say not only
is this possible

37:38.125 --> 37:41.917
but that this is how humans will
eventually leave the planet

37:42.042 --> 37:45.375
and travel the stars.

37:55.292 --> 37:59.042
NARRATOR:
August 27, 2019.

38:01.250 --> 38:04.500
Space X announces
the successful test flight

38:04.667 --> 38:07.833
of its starship prototype
<i>Starhopper.</i>

38:07.958 --> 38:11.083
The founder of
the private aerospace company,

38:11.208 --> 38:14.667
billionaire Elon Musk,
has also been at the forefront

38:14.750 --> 38:17.958
of efforts to upgrade humankind.

38:18.042 --> 38:21.500
It is his belief that
both pursuits are critical

38:21.625 --> 38:24.375
to ensuring the survival
of the human race.

38:25.125 --> 38:27.542
It's interesting that, today,

38:27.708 --> 38:31.750
we have these adventurer
billionaires like Elon Musk,

38:31.875 --> 38:36.333
and they want to put
computer chips in our brains,

38:36.417 --> 38:40.083
even map our
own consciousness and put

38:40.208 --> 38:42.000
that in a robot or cyborg,

38:42.125 --> 38:45.667
and they're wanting to go
into space at the same time.

38:45.792 --> 38:47.292
So, in many ways,

38:47.417 --> 38:49.042
they're like the

38:49.208 --> 38:50.500
alien explorers

38:50.625 --> 38:53.083
who came here in the past.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.833
KAKU:
I think with known technologies,

38:56.917 --> 39:00.542
we can theorize, that is,
within 100, within 200 years,

39:00.708 --> 39:03.750
we're talking about
fusion rockets and antimatter

39:03.875 --> 39:07.042
rockets capable
of reaching the stars.

39:07.167 --> 39:09.292
And then I think
we'll be sending

39:09.417 --> 39:13.500
robots into outer space
that are actually avatars.

39:13.625 --> 39:17.042
I personally think this is
the future of the space program,

39:17.167 --> 39:20.667
and I think we will do this
using laser beams.

39:20.792 --> 39:23.750
If we can digitize
the human brain,

39:23.875 --> 39:26.958
we can put that knowledge
on a laser beam

39:27.083 --> 39:28.375
and shoot it to the Moon.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.333
In one second,

39:30.417 --> 39:32.500
you are on the Moon.

39:32.583 --> 39:35.375
In 20 minutes,
you could be on Mars.

39:35.500 --> 39:38.125
In four years,
at the speed of light,

39:38.250 --> 39:40.833
you could reach
the nearby stars.

39:40.958 --> 39:42.083
And what would you do?

39:42.208 --> 39:43.583
If that laser beam goes

39:43.708 --> 39:46.125
to the Moon, is then downloaded

39:46.250 --> 39:47.833
into an avatar,

39:47.917 --> 39:51.250
that avatar could withstand
gravity fields,

39:51.375 --> 39:52.833
poisonous gases,

39:53.000 --> 39:54.375
radiation from the Sun.

39:54.542 --> 39:57.167
And in fact,
I'll stick my neck out.

39:57.250 --> 39:59.000
I think this already exists.

39:59.167 --> 40:01.458
I think this is
the preferred way

40:01.542 --> 40:05.208
for an advanced alien species
to explore the universe.

40:05.333 --> 40:07.083
In fact, near the Earth,

40:07.208 --> 40:08.833
there could be a digital highway

40:09.000 --> 40:10.667
with the digitized souls

40:10.750 --> 40:14.833
of billions of aliens going
across the Milky Way Galaxy.

40:14.958 --> 40:17.833
So I think when we
meet aliens from outer space,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.667
we should not be surprised
if they're actually

40:20.792 --> 40:23.708
avatars that are controlled by

40:23.875 --> 40:26.333
the aliens
in a distant star system.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.583
NARRATOR:
As entrepreneurs

40:28.708 --> 40:31.000
continue to invest
billions in pursuit

40:31.125 --> 40:34.083
of both space travel
and whole brain emulation,

40:34.208 --> 40:37.500
are we getting closer to
becoming like the immortals

40:37.625 --> 40:41.500
our ancestors described
thousands of years ago?

40:41.625 --> 40:45.000
And if these immortals were
responsible for the creation

40:45.125 --> 40:46.458
of the human race,

40:46.542 --> 40:49.250
as ancient astronaut
theorists suggest,

40:49.375 --> 40:52.583
could this evolution be exactly

40:52.708 --> 40:55.708
what they intended
for humankind all along?

40:57.542 --> 40:59.667
Why would extraterrestrials
come to Earth

40:59.750 --> 41:01.750
and start a human project,

41:01.875 --> 41:04.125
knowing that it would
take thousands of years

41:04.208 --> 41:05.708
for us to, to develop?

41:05.833 --> 41:08.167
Well, it could perhaps
be that extraterrestrials

41:08.292 --> 41:12.542
have a different perspective
of time than we do.

41:12.708 --> 41:14.833
If we think
of the extraterrestrials

41:14.958 --> 41:17.500
as immortal, time is irrelevant.

41:17.625 --> 41:20.958
And their goal
is to assist humanity

41:21.042 --> 41:23.625
to become more like them.

41:25.042 --> 41:28.042
TAYLOR:
There's a potential that
humanity is going to become

41:28.167 --> 41:31.250
a starfaring nation
that has long life

41:31.375 --> 41:33.500
because you're gonna need that
for some of these long journeys.

41:33.625 --> 41:36.958
And we might become more
like the gods that seemed to

41:37.042 --> 41:40.708
live for thousands of years
and traveled the heavens.

41:42.875 --> 41:45.333
NARRATOR: Is humanity
on the verge of becoming

41:45.417 --> 41:47.458
an intergalactic civilization?

41:47.542 --> 41:50.708
And if so,
is it possible that we

41:50.875 --> 41:54.000
were set on this path
by an extraterrestrial race

41:54.125 --> 41:57.250
that visited Earth
thousands of years ago?

41:57.375 --> 42:00.292
Perhaps one day,
the immortal gods

42:00.375 --> 42:02.583
seen descending from the sky

42:02.708 --> 42:05.125
on a distant planet...

42:05.208 --> 42:06.875
will be us.
