00:01.669 --> 00:03.702
-<i> Previously on The Strain...</i>
- I found a way to kill these

00:03.704 --> 00:06.671
things. It's a bioweapon. It's
crude, it needs to be refined,

00:06.673 --> 00:08.472
but it works.
- Goodweather.

00:08.474 --> 00:11.041
- He's here for me, not for you.
No! Wait!

00:15.613 --> 00:16.529
- Who put this up?

00:16.555 --> 00:18.513
- That's your friend from
the convenience store?

00:18.515 --> 00:20.481
- We were more than
just friends.

00:20.483 --> 00:23.016
- Men or women?
- I specialize

00:23.018 --> 00:25.284
<i> in passionate, destructive</i>
<i> relationships.</i>

00:25.286 --> 00:27.452
<i> - The best kind.</i>

00:27.454 --> 00:30.354
- This airport's in a restricted
area. There's a quarantine.

00:30.356 --> 00:34.124
-<i> I sensed him when</i>
<i> he was injured.</i>

00:34.126 --> 00:37.060
<i> I will stop him, but for</i>
<i> my own reasons --</i>

00:37.062 --> 00:39.896
which you well know.
(growling)

00:39.898 --> 00:42.365
I need to know who got
close enough to hurt him.

00:42.367 --> 00:46.369
And I need human hunters.
That is, if you have any left.

00:52.009 --> 00:55.176
- (Setrakian):<i> They called him</i>
<i> the Barbarian Gladiator.</i>

00:55.178 --> 00:57.511
<i> A warrior like none other.</i>

00:57.513 --> 01:00.580
<i> Unmatched in speed,</i>

01:00.582 --> 01:04.316
<i> strength and savagery.</i>

01:06.520 --> 01:09.721
<i>He defeated every challenger --</i>

01:09.723 --> 01:13.424
<i> man and beast.</i>

01:13.426 --> 01:16.593
<i> None lasted more</i>
<i> than a few minutes.</i>

01:16.595 --> 01:19.662
<i> Most, not more than</i>
<i> a few seconds.</i>

01:30.741 --> 01:33.675
(roaring cheers)

01:41.851 --> 01:44.551
(low growl)

01:44.553 --> 01:48.087
(yelling)

02:01.601 --> 02:04.101
(grunting)

02:14.212 --> 02:17.379
(growling)

02:25.921 --> 02:29.422
- Please.

02:29.424 --> 02:33.792
- (crowd): KILL! KILL! KILL!
KILL! KILL!

02:33.794 --> 02:37.061
KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL!

02:37.063 --> 02:41.931
KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL!
KILL! KILL! KILL!

02:41.933 --> 02:45.567
- It's not I who wants
this outcome.

02:45.569 --> 02:48.636
Your own kind demands it.

02:48.638 --> 02:50.871
(cheering)

03:11.092 --> 03:13.192
(growling)
- (Setrakian):<i> A senator</i>

03:13.194 --> 03:16.995
<i> with more than a passing</i>
<i> familiarity with the dark arts</i>

03:16.997 --> 03:20.565
<i> sponsored</i>
<i> the Barbarian Gladiator.</i>

03:34.847 --> 03:38.148
- They call you the
Night Demon of Sicily.

03:38.150 --> 03:40.617
It took an entire army
detachment to capture you

03:40.619 --> 03:43.353
at the cost of 20 soldiers.

03:43.355 --> 03:46.556
- They wanted me so badly;
I decided to see what for.

03:46.558 --> 03:50.393
- You were to be crucified.
The games saved you.

03:50.395 --> 03:53.562
- The greed of the Patrician
class and the savage impulse

03:53.564 --> 03:56.031
of the masses saved me.

03:56.033 --> 03:59.401
- You care not
for food or drink.

03:59.403 --> 04:02.570
You care only
for the juice of one animal.

04:02.572 --> 04:05.606
The human animal.

04:10.012 --> 04:13.079
You bleed white, yet you
tolerate exposure to the sun.

04:13.081 --> 04:15.915
You are the half-breed,

04:15.917 --> 04:19.852
birthed of human flesh
and demon blood,

04:19.854 --> 04:23.655
possessed of a God-like
strength and agility.

04:23.657 --> 04:26.758
Why do you not escape?

04:26.760 --> 04:29.660
- I am a student of human
instinct and behavior.

04:29.662 --> 04:34.431
I find I learn best
as their instrument.

04:38.936 --> 04:42.404
- If you want to learn
about man's true nature,

04:42.406 --> 04:47.442
I can offer you
a complete education...

04:47.444 --> 04:51.512
on the field of battle.

05:05.527 --> 05:08.027
(theme music)

05:28.114 --> 05:30.147
- Hey.

05:30.149 --> 05:33.349
- You watching me dream?

05:35.419 --> 05:39.020
- I was just waiting
for you to wake up.

05:45.594 --> 05:48.061
- I'm sorry I wasn't there
last night.

05:48.063 --> 05:52.031
Just... still working
through some things.

05:59.606 --> 06:02.106
Poor Fitzwilliam.

06:02.108 --> 06:05.442
- Yeah, that's too bad.

06:05.444 --> 06:10.112
He could've been helpful
to us, you know?

06:10.114 --> 06:12.580
- I don't want to get dressed.

06:15.451 --> 06:18.985
- I don't want you
to get dressed either.

06:18.987 --> 06:22.588
- That's not what I meant.
- Are you sure?

06:22.590 --> 06:25.791
- I have been wearing the same
three outfits for days.

06:25.793 --> 06:29.461
Maybe I should go and get
the rest of my things.

06:29.463 --> 06:31.496
- You should.

06:31.498 --> 06:34.599
Just clear all your stuff out

06:34.601 --> 06:37.602
and move them in here.

06:37.604 --> 06:41.172
- Moving my things in.

06:41.174 --> 06:43.340
And that's not
a commitment or anything.

06:43.342 --> 06:45.542
- Of course not.

07:14.205 --> 07:16.905
- What about the furniture?

07:16.907 --> 07:18.840
- Is it yours?

07:18.842 --> 07:22.409
- Most of it's Nikki's. Paid for
by her generous mother.

07:24.246 --> 07:28.347
- Is that the wrong key?
- No, it's dead bolted

07:28.349 --> 07:31.049
from the inside.
- Step back.

07:45.497 --> 07:47.997
- I don't smell vamp shit.

07:47.999 --> 07:51.733
- Vamps don't lock doors.
Squatters.

07:51.735 --> 07:54.569
SHOW YOURSELF!

07:56.372 --> 07:59.406
(creaking)

07:59.408 --> 08:01.674
Hey.

08:08.883 --> 08:11.049
(sob)
- NIKKI!

08:11.051 --> 08:14.252
(sobbing)
- Oh my God!

08:14.254 --> 08:16.854
Oh my God!

08:16.856 --> 08:20.890
- You're alive.
- Oh my God! Oh my God!

08:20.892 --> 08:24.093
- Are you OK? Are you OK?

08:38.275 --> 08:40.275
- Everything all right,
Mr. Palmer?

08:40.277 --> 08:44.045
- I'm sorry,
I was just thinking.

08:44.047 --> 08:48.048
Looks like an absolutely
gorgeous day.

08:48.050 --> 08:51.251
Maybe I'll take a ride later.

08:51.253 --> 08:53.319
Perhaps you'd like
to accompany me?

08:53.321 --> 08:55.954
- That sounds wonderful.

08:55.956 --> 08:59.924
- Mr. Palmer, excuse me. I have
an update on Goodweather.

08:59.926 --> 09:02.660
- Coco, could I trouble you

09:02.662 --> 09:05.896
for a cup of that wonderful
herbal tea you recommended?

09:05.898 --> 09:08.732
- Certainly, Mr. Palmer.

09:13.838 --> 09:16.238
- Sorry, sir. You said you
wanted to be updated right away.

09:16.240 --> 09:19.074
- Yes, yes. What happened?
- Leavitt's dead.

09:19.076 --> 09:21.009
Goodweather shot him
and got away somehow.

09:21.011 --> 09:23.778
- Has Leavitt's body been found?
- No, we took care of that.

09:23.780 --> 09:27.615
- And Goodweather's bioweapon?
- In friendly hands.

09:27.617 --> 09:29.516
It's contained.
- For now. He certainly could

09:29.518 --> 09:32.852
reformulate it.

09:32.854 --> 09:35.120
How soon until
he's taken care of?

09:35.122 --> 09:37.288
- That's the thing, sir.
We've lost his trail.

09:37.290 --> 09:39.490
We don't know where he is.

09:56.542 --> 09:58.775
(gasp)

10:42.886 --> 10:45.052
(grunting)

11:11.379 --> 11:13.345
- Everything OK?
- Couldn't be better.

11:13.347 --> 11:15.680
Do you have chilled bourbon?
- Well, I got bourbon

11:15.682 --> 11:17.882
and I got ice.

11:17.884 --> 11:20.985
- Bourbon straight.
Double, please.

11:35.267 --> 11:40.103
- You know, some people like
to sip...and enjoy.

11:44.575 --> 11:46.741
- Maybe next time.

11:46.743 --> 11:50.710
- After the convenience store, I
came back here looking for you.

11:50.712 --> 11:53.412
- I didn't come back,
not right away.

11:53.414 --> 11:56.615
I was scared out of my mind.
Those creepers at the gas

11:56.617 --> 11:58.583
station, they gave up
on me pretty quickly.

11:58.585 --> 12:01.619
- That's 'cause they
weren't there for you.

12:01.621 --> 12:04.489
They were there for the old man.
- So, you stayed with them?

12:04.491 --> 12:07.258
Those strangers from the store?
- Yeah, well, I didn't have

12:07.260 --> 12:09.760
a choice at first. And then...

12:11.597 --> 12:15.031
Yeah, I stayed with them.

12:15.033 --> 12:17.566
- She joined the fight.

12:17.568 --> 12:21.503
She's a hell of a fighter too.
How 'bout you, Nikki?

12:21.505 --> 12:23.872
Where you been all this time?

12:23.874 --> 12:26.241
You been hiding out
in that closet, or what?

12:26.243 --> 12:29.444
- I, uh, strained my ankle,

12:29.446 --> 12:32.013
falling, running
from those things.

12:32.015 --> 12:34.615
I thought it was a fracture.
I tried to go to the ER, but

12:34.617 --> 12:37.784
I got so scared. I've been holed
up in here every night since.

12:40.388 --> 12:43.622
- I'm so glad you're alive.

12:46.927 --> 12:50.395
- Well, it's great.

12:50.397 --> 12:54.031
It's really, really
heartwarming. It really is.

12:54.033 --> 12:58.567
But... Setrakian...
He's waiting for us, right?

12:58.569 --> 13:01.202
- Yeah.
- You said you wanted

13:01.204 --> 13:03.137
to come back here
to get your clothes--

13:03.139 --> 13:05.572
- Why don't we both
get our things.

13:05.574 --> 13:08.174
It's so much safer there.

13:18.085 --> 13:19.984
- (Fet):<i> We have company.</i>

13:19.986 --> 13:22.653
- You're from
the convenience store.

13:22.655 --> 13:25.622
- It's me.
- This is Nikki, my roommate.

13:25.624 --> 13:28.758
This is Nora; she's a doctor.
She has a bad ankle.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.460
- She hurt herself running away.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.995
- Tell me where it hurts.
- I've been waiting for you

13:33.997 --> 13:36.931
all morning. We need to go.
- Just give me one second.

13:36.933 --> 13:38.832
Hey, Dutch.

13:38.834 --> 13:42.468
Can I have a moment, please?
- How about later, yeah?

13:42.470 --> 13:44.803
- How 'bout now?

13:56.983 --> 13:59.817
- So?

13:59.819 --> 14:03.453
- So?
- Aren't you going to ask her?

14:03.455 --> 14:06.522
About the money that
mysteriously disappeared from

14:06.524 --> 14:09.625
your apartment? Your laptop?
- None of that's important now,

14:09.627 --> 14:12.027
is it? She's terrified.

14:12.029 --> 14:14.295
She's been through it.

14:14.297 --> 14:17.598
- Oh, is that why you seem

14:17.600 --> 14:19.933
a little reluctant

14:19.935 --> 14:22.168
to tell her about us?

14:25.973 --> 14:28.273
- She is dealing
with so much right now.

14:28.275 --> 14:33.043
Just give her time. And me.

14:33.045 --> 14:35.445
- Give you time?

14:39.349 --> 14:42.883
What for?

14:42.885 --> 14:45.485
- I've got to get back to her.

14:45.487 --> 14:47.620
- Dutch, Setrakian needs us.

14:47.622 --> 14:49.955
He wants to go to that factory

14:49.957 --> 14:52.190
that Fitzwilliam
told us about, so...

14:52.192 --> 14:54.358
- I can't leave her here
like this.

14:54.360 --> 14:58.228
You understand that, right?

14:58.230 --> 15:01.197
- Yeah. OK.

15:01.199 --> 15:04.300
- You can handle this.
- Mm-hmm.

15:04.302 --> 15:07.703
You go.
- I will.

15:13.009 --> 15:16.076
- Mr. Fet!

15:19.914 --> 15:22.147
- Coming!

15:30.423 --> 15:33.924
- "She's dealing
with so much right now."

15:33.926 --> 15:36.760
Dealing with what?
Leaving her apartment closet?

15:36.762 --> 15:40.230
What? A twisted ankle?
- Mr. Fet. Your romantic worries

15:40.232 --> 15:42.832
have no relevance at this
moment. None at all.

15:42.834 --> 15:45.668
- You're right.

15:45.670 --> 15:48.737
- I have a very strong
instinct about this.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.272
Something very bad
is happening here.

15:51.274 --> 15:55.509
- Well, let's have
a closer look. After you.

16:16.898 --> 16:19.398
- What's a school bus
for blind kids

16:19.400 --> 16:21.633
doing at a Stoneheart factory?

16:29.709 --> 16:33.143
- I trust you've come prepared?
- I'm always prepared.

16:33.145 --> 16:36.645
- Control, this
is Security Officer--

16:36.647 --> 16:39.314
(grunting)

16:45.454 --> 16:48.020
(growling)

16:49.923 --> 16:53.124
- So, what about the big guy?
The Russian.

16:53.126 --> 16:56.060
- What about him?
- What's his deal?

16:58.097 --> 17:00.163
- He doesn't really have a deal.

17:00.165 --> 17:02.965
That's kind of the nice thing
about him. What you see is what

17:02.967 --> 17:05.467
you get.
- So, what are the sleeping

17:05.469 --> 17:07.569
arrangements here?
Where's your, um...

17:07.571 --> 17:10.171
(knocking)

17:12.308 --> 17:15.909
- Alright!

17:19.014 --> 17:21.280
- Dr. Goodweather, I presume.

17:21.282 --> 17:24.316
How did it go in DC?

17:24.318 --> 17:27.285
Total success
by the looks of it.

17:27.287 --> 17:29.954
- Do I know you?
Because I feel like I do.

17:29.956 --> 17:34.657
- Yeah, we all met that fateful
night at the convenience store?

17:34.659 --> 17:37.292
- The track star! That's right!
Welcome back.

17:37.294 --> 17:40.128
Uh, where's Fet?

17:40.130 --> 17:42.663
- Out, with Setrakian.

17:42.665 --> 17:46.633
- Is Zack in?
- Yeah, in his room.

17:46.635 --> 17:49.302
Alright, OK. Why don't
you just sit down

17:49.304 --> 17:51.203
before you fall down? Come on.

17:51.205 --> 17:53.371
- Sure, I should get
some shut-eye.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.006
- Nora's napping
up there. She'll

17:56.008 --> 17:59.943
be glad to see you're home.
- Yeah, maybe I should lie down

17:59.945 --> 18:02.679
in yours and Fet's room.

18:26.971 --> 18:30.405
- These critters. Dead.

18:32.809 --> 18:34.842
Necks snapped.

18:34.844 --> 18:37.344
- Culled from the herd.

18:37.346 --> 18:40.980
- What is this,
like a mass grave?

18:40.982 --> 18:43.349
- The opposite.

18:43.351 --> 18:45.584
A nursery.

18:47.387 --> 18:50.688
- Blind kids.

18:50.690 --> 18:52.656
That just ain't right.

18:52.658 --> 18:56.593
(snarling)

18:56.595 --> 18:59.329
- Professor!
- I hear it.

18:59.331 --> 19:01.564
(snarling)

19:01.566 --> 19:03.799
(squealing)

19:13.376 --> 19:17.177
(chirping and screeching)

19:17.179 --> 19:20.346
- They're coordinated.
- The Master.

19:20.348 --> 19:23.782
- Yeah.

19:23.784 --> 19:27.685
I'm just gonna keep on firing,
hope I get lucky.

19:27.687 --> 19:31.521
Just in case, I'm gonna
save the last two for us.

19:31.523 --> 19:33.523
(grunting)

19:33.525 --> 19:36.526
- Now, come on, you little
monkeys! COME ON! BRING IT!

19:36.528 --> 19:38.694
LET'S DO THIS!

19:45.736 --> 19:48.136
(low growl)

19:49.939 --> 19:52.272
- Mr. Fet.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.607
- What?

20:13.928 --> 20:16.228
(shrieking)

20:16.230 --> 20:18.997
(growling and barking)

20:43.923 --> 20:46.156
(shrieking)

20:50.629 --> 20:53.496
(hissing and screeching)

21:03.707 --> 21:07.041
- Hello, Professor.

21:17.052 --> 21:19.519
(distant sirens)

21:19.521 --> 21:22.555
- And to think I was looking
forward to a nice car ride.

21:22.557 --> 21:25.324
- Perspective, Coco.
Difficult to maintain

21:25.326 --> 21:27.626
but critical for success.

21:27.628 --> 21:29.861
- I've never been this high
above the city before.

21:29.863 --> 21:32.396
(soft thump)
(laughing)

21:37.669 --> 21:40.202
- I'm sorry, I have to ask:

21:40.204 --> 21:42.804
earlier today your head
of security mentioned

21:42.806 --> 21:45.640
a Dr. Goodweather?
- The disgraced

21:45.642 --> 21:48.542
CDC epidemiologist? Yes.

21:48.544 --> 21:51.645
Apparently, he found his way
down to Washington DC

21:51.647 --> 21:55.247
and murdered three people,
including his former boss,

21:55.249 --> 21:58.049
Dr. Everett Barnes.

21:58.051 --> 22:01.352
Everett was a dear
friend of mine.

22:01.354 --> 22:04.088
Joshua was just breaking
the news to me.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.356
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- It's tragic.

22:06.358 --> 22:09.993
As terrible as this plague
has been for New York City,

22:09.995 --> 22:12.829
there is something
to be said for regeneration.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.698
Yellowstone National Park,
for example.

22:15.700 --> 22:18.434
Much of it burned
in a massive wildfire.

22:18.436 --> 22:22.604
Ten years later, the landscape
was completely renewed.

22:22.606 --> 22:27.342
And while no one would ever wish
for a catastrophe such as this,

22:27.344 --> 22:31.845
complacency is the enemy
of empires.

22:31.847 --> 22:34.180
Just ask the Romans.

22:43.657 --> 22:47.791
(hissing)

22:47.793 --> 22:50.994
- The Ancients gave me
your name,

22:50.996 --> 22:53.563
Professor Setrakian.

22:53.565 --> 22:55.865
I followed you here.

22:55.867 --> 22:58.500
- But...who are you?

22:58.502 --> 23:01.069
- My name is Quinlan.

23:01.071 --> 23:03.404
And you and I have something
very much in common.

23:03.406 --> 23:06.306
- What's that?
- We are both

23:06.308 --> 23:08.341
hunting the Master.

23:08.343 --> 23:11.877
- You know the Ancients?

23:11.879 --> 23:14.412
- Hold on. What are
the Ancients?

23:14.414 --> 23:16.914
What the hell is this guy?

23:16.916 --> 23:19.583
- If you discharge that weapon
in my direction,

23:19.585 --> 23:24.053
I shall come over there
and tear you in half.

23:26.157 --> 23:29.224
I see you've been hunting
the Master for some time.

23:29.226 --> 23:32.560
- Most of my life. You?

23:34.597 --> 23:37.764
- All of mine.

23:42.703 --> 23:45.336
(horse whinnies)

23:45.338 --> 23:47.804
(indistinct voices)

23:50.742 --> 23:52.875
- You from this place?

23:52.877 --> 23:56.545
- Sire. This home is abandoned.

23:56.547 --> 24:00.115
The entire village...forsaken.

24:00.117 --> 24:03.518
Accursed. First,
it was the children.

24:03.520 --> 24:07.621
Drawn from their beds,
taken in sleep. The next night,

24:07.623 --> 24:10.090
they returned
to spread the sleeping sickness

24:10.092 --> 24:13.560
to their kin. Soon after, the
healthy fled for their lives.

24:13.562 --> 24:16.596
The ghosts still come down
after nightfall.

24:16.598 --> 24:19.031
- The giant in the castle.

24:19.033 --> 24:20.932
Is he still here?

24:20.934 --> 24:24.302
- You know this tale, sire?
- This tale is what brought me

24:24.304 --> 24:28.372
to this place. Now I fear
I am too late.

25:11.416 --> 25:16.018
(growling)

25:21.492 --> 25:26.260
- So it is "Sardu" now?

25:26.262 --> 25:29.129
(growling)

25:29.131 --> 25:31.264
Your new host body
no longer requires

25:31.266 --> 25:34.000
this fine cane.

25:41.341 --> 25:43.774
You knew I would hear
of the strange tale

25:43.776 --> 25:46.176
of the possessed giant
and come for you.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.878
I suppose that's why
you left these here.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.213
To taunt me.

25:54.818 --> 25:58.185
But your vigilance belies
a deeper concern.

26:00.489 --> 26:02.956
Your fear.

26:02.958 --> 26:06.258
(hissing)
(shouting)

26:07.794 --> 26:10.394
- You know this cane.

26:10.396 --> 26:12.729
The Sardu legend.

26:12.731 --> 26:17.232
- That cane is proof that
it is not a legend.

26:17.234 --> 26:21.735
There are no myths, Professor.

26:21.737 --> 26:23.837
Only exaggerations.

26:23.839 --> 26:26.840
- Or hidden truths,
such as the Ancients.

26:26.842 --> 26:28.842
What did they tell you?

26:28.844 --> 26:31.377
- They told me about a mortal

26:31.379 --> 26:36.181
who'd succeeded in hunting down
and wounding the Master.

26:36.183 --> 26:39.184
The Dark Lord has taken on
various forms

26:39.186 --> 26:41.719
over the centuries,
but always by choice.

26:41.721 --> 26:44.821
No one has ever forced
him to transform.

26:46.658 --> 26:48.824
Until now.

26:48.826 --> 26:51.026
- He has taken on a new form?

26:51.028 --> 26:54.662
- And yet your first victory is
a minor one compared to this.

26:54.664 --> 26:56.530
- What's that?

26:56.532 --> 26:59.833
- You have led me
to his nesting place.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.901
- His... his what?

27:01.903 --> 27:05.237
Here?

27:07.007 --> 27:08.906
- What the hell just happened?

27:08.908 --> 27:11.341
- He's here. In this building.
- I got that part.

27:11.343 --> 27:13.343
But what the hell was that?

27:13.345 --> 27:16.746
- We can't let the Master
escape. We must bring down

27:16.748 --> 27:18.848
this structure on the Master.

27:18.850 --> 27:21.917
- Well, we can do that.
It'll be pretty messy, though.

27:21.919 --> 27:24.452
And what about your new friend,
Mr. Myth, over there?

27:24.454 --> 27:27.021
- Nothing matters more
than destroying

27:27.023 --> 27:30.024
the Master! Go! Fast as you can!

27:30.026 --> 27:32.860
- Stay close.

27:48.377 --> 27:50.810
- Why didn't you wake me?

27:50.812 --> 27:51.811
(groans)

27:51.813 --> 27:54.246
My God!

27:54.248 --> 27:57.448
What happened?

28:00.286 --> 28:02.586
Kelly got close, Eph.

28:02.588 --> 28:05.288
Setrakian thinks the Master
has made her one of the more

28:05.290 --> 28:08.557
sentient strigoi.
- Jesus Christ.

28:08.559 --> 28:11.226
- I'm pretty sure Zack saw her.

28:11.228 --> 28:14.229
You need to talk to him.

28:14.231 --> 28:16.965
- Maybe he didn't.

28:16.967 --> 28:18.933
- Don't downplay this, Eph!

28:18.935 --> 28:22.669
They nearly got us.
She's not gonna stop.

28:24.739 --> 28:27.506
- I'm so sorry.

28:27.508 --> 28:29.474
I should've been there for Zack.

28:29.476 --> 28:32.910
It just... It seemed so good.
Like it was all coming together.

28:36.748 --> 28:40.649
And then it was all taken away.

28:40.651 --> 28:43.585
It was Eldritch Palmer.

28:43.587 --> 28:45.587
- You're sure?

28:45.589 --> 28:47.789
- He had Rob murdered.

28:47.791 --> 28:50.925
He's been five steps ahead
of us this entire time.

28:50.927 --> 28:53.093
From the plane right till now.

28:54.930 --> 28:56.863
- He hasn't beaten us.

28:56.865 --> 28:59.799
We can grow more
of the bioweapon ourselves.

28:59.801 --> 29:03.602
We'll take our time,
make it even more lethal.

29:05.372 --> 29:08.439
- I'm sorry; I'm all out
of optimism right now.

29:15.780 --> 29:19.047
- Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
- You guys got

29:19.049 --> 29:21.049
an emergency alarm here?
- Sure do.

29:21.051 --> 29:24.185
- Better get someone to hit it.
Someone just called in

29:24.187 --> 29:26.520
a bomb threat.
- Who?

29:26.522 --> 29:29.956
- Me!
- Hey! Hey!

29:29.958 --> 29:33.825
We got a maniac with a bag
of dynamite. Evacuate! Evacuate!

29:33.827 --> 29:36.060
(men yelling)

29:50.842 --> 29:53.976
- What are you now?

30:04.154 --> 30:07.889
- I have been expecting you.

30:14.430 --> 30:17.164
Welcome to the new world.

30:17.166 --> 30:20.934
- I see you had little time
to prepare your new vessel.

30:20.936 --> 30:23.369
- I chose this host
for its loyalty.

30:23.371 --> 30:26.205
Something you know
nothing about.

30:26.207 --> 30:30.408
- It lacks...intimidation.

30:32.578 --> 30:36.079
- You'd hoped to find me
weakened and hurt.

30:36.081 --> 30:40.082
As ever, you are too late.
- What's this?

30:40.084 --> 30:42.717
Your new lapdog?

30:42.719 --> 30:44.885
- I'm curious about something.

30:44.887 --> 30:48.521
Your power depends on darkness,

30:48.523 --> 30:52.524
invisibility, obscurity. Yet

30:52.526 --> 30:55.360
this siege

30:55.362 --> 30:58.363
exposes you.

30:58.365 --> 31:01.431
Leaves you vulnerable.

31:03.968 --> 31:08.270
What is it you're after?
(growling)

31:45.775 --> 31:49.076
(beeping)

32:01.322 --> 32:05.323
- You.
- Now it's a proper duel,

32:05.325 --> 32:08.192
complete with seconds.

32:08.194 --> 32:10.594
- What a team you two make.

32:10.596 --> 32:14.531
United and crippled
by lifelong hatred.

32:14.533 --> 32:17.033
- This human embarrassed you.

32:17.035 --> 32:19.368
Now I'm about to destroy you.

32:19.370 --> 32:22.070
- On the contrary.

32:22.072 --> 32:24.739
I'll make you scream out
in agony.

32:24.741 --> 32:27.408
As I did your mother.

32:27.410 --> 32:31.378
(yelling)

32:31.380 --> 32:33.947
(explosions)

32:33.949 --> 32:37.016
(the Master laughing)
- NO!

32:48.629 --> 32:51.997
I had him.
(grunting)

32:51.999 --> 32:55.333
He was here.
(heavy breathing)

33:00.072 --> 33:04.474
You cost me a chance
to destroy him once and for all.

33:04.476 --> 33:06.708
Now he will shore up
his defenses.

33:09.012 --> 33:12.246
This is my fight.
I will take it from here.

33:16.484 --> 33:18.484
- Hey.

33:18.486 --> 33:21.286
You all right?

33:21.288 --> 33:24.422
Did we get him?
- They're gone.

33:24.424 --> 33:26.757
- Who, the Master or,
what, the other guy? Who?

33:26.759 --> 33:29.126
(police sirens)

33:29.128 --> 33:34.164
- We gotta get outta here.
C'mon. C'mon. Fast!

33:50.314 --> 33:52.314
- Dad?

33:52.316 --> 33:55.383
Dad.

34:02.491 --> 34:05.859
- So, what happened?

34:05.861 --> 34:10.329
- Things, uh, things didn't go
exactly as I had planned.

34:10.331 --> 34:12.331
- But...why not?

34:12.333 --> 34:14.900
You said you had a solution.

34:14.902 --> 34:18.637
- Well, sometimes
a solution isn't enough.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.572
Sometimes you need
to knock down a lot of doors

34:20.574 --> 34:22.907
before you find
the right way in.

34:22.909 --> 34:25.142
But, that's all over for now.

34:25.144 --> 34:28.711
I'm back for good.
- OK, good.

34:30.848 --> 34:33.381
- Nora told me about last night.
That must have been

34:33.383 --> 34:37.151
really scary.
- I think I saw Mom.

34:37.153 --> 34:40.187
Was it Mom?
- I don't know. I wasn't there.

34:40.189 --> 34:43.023
- Nora saw her.

34:43.025 --> 34:46.059
Tell him, Nora.
- I already did.

34:57.872 --> 35:01.873
- Well, I do know that your
mother loved you very much.

35:01.875 --> 35:04.208
And sometimes, when people turn,

35:04.210 --> 35:08.545
that bonding instinct can become
a source of attraction.

35:08.547 --> 35:11.781
- Yeah, the "dear one" --

35:11.783 --> 35:14.450
Mr. Setrakian already
told me about it.

35:14.452 --> 35:17.419
- He did?

35:17.421 --> 35:20.855
Well, I'm gonna keep you safe.
That's a promise.

35:20.857 --> 35:23.757
- Hey Dad?

35:25.927 --> 35:28.027
Maybe you shouldn't promise.

35:28.029 --> 35:30.262
You know what happens
every time you promise.

35:30.264 --> 35:32.397
- Cool.

35:32.399 --> 35:34.866
No promises.

35:34.868 --> 35:37.168
I promise not to promise.

35:40.373 --> 35:43.540
- I can't believe I'm actually
going to say this, but...

35:43.542 --> 35:46.509
...you really should
call your mother.

35:50.715 --> 35:54.315
- These are up all over.

35:54.317 --> 35:56.984
She's worried sick.

35:56.986 --> 35:59.319
- Have you been carrying
this around?

36:03.124 --> 36:06.959
- Hey. You're never going to
guess what we saw today--

36:06.961 --> 36:10.462
- Hi! We've been making dinner
for everyone. Um...

36:10.464 --> 36:13.298
There was this guy, he was
leaving and loading up his car

36:13.300 --> 36:15.400
and he gave us
some fresh tomatoes.

36:15.402 --> 36:17.602
- Yeah, that's great.

36:17.604 --> 36:19.670
Hm.
- What happened?

36:19.672 --> 36:21.638
What did you see?

36:21.640 --> 36:24.273
- It can wait.
People are hungry.

36:24.275 --> 36:28.009
- Hey, Mr. Fet. How goes
the battle for New York?

36:28.011 --> 36:31.412
- The prodigal son returns, huh?

36:31.414 --> 36:33.580
So when do the, uh,
fighter jets appear?

36:33.582 --> 36:35.915
- You're still blowing up
our fair city.

36:35.917 --> 36:38.117
- Yeah.

36:38.119 --> 36:40.252
I like to think
I'm doing my share.

36:40.254 --> 36:43.655
More than my share,
actually.

36:43.657 --> 36:46.190
We saved your boy last night.

36:46.192 --> 36:48.926
I guess it does
take a village to raise a kid --

36:48.928 --> 36:51.695
especially when his father
ain't around.

36:51.697 --> 36:56.098
- Hey, where the hell
is this coming from?

36:56.100 --> 36:57.999
- Ah...

36:58.001 --> 37:01.335
I see a lot has changed
since I left.

37:09.944 --> 37:11.843
- Drink up, Doc.

37:11.845 --> 37:16.780
Everybody just
make yourselves at home! Hm?

37:16.782 --> 37:21.251
- Fet! Fet!

37:26.724 --> 37:29.791
You happy now?
- I'm not the one he's

37:29.793 --> 37:32.193
running away from.

37:34.330 --> 37:37.397
- (Eldritch): Ah!
Reinforcements.

37:37.399 --> 37:40.400
- Mm-hmm.
(soft jazz playing)

37:40.402 --> 37:43.669
- Thank you. Cheers.

37:43.671 --> 37:46.204
(clink)

37:52.245 --> 37:55.646
(sighing deeply)
- Today was amazing.

37:55.648 --> 37:58.181
- It's rather nice
to have a helicopter.

37:58.183 --> 38:00.550
(laughing)

38:00.552 --> 38:02.552
- I'm learning
so much from you.

38:02.554 --> 38:05.922
- As am I from you.
- From me?

38:05.924 --> 38:07.924
Like what?

38:07.926 --> 38:10.493
- Well, as absurd
as it may sound,

38:10.495 --> 38:13.829
I had no idea
how isolated I was.

38:13.831 --> 38:15.864
It's so reassuring
to have someone

38:15.866 --> 38:17.999
to talk to.
(sipping)

38:18.001 --> 38:20.668
- I know you never married.

38:20.670 --> 38:24.204
No...long-term relationships?

38:24.206 --> 38:27.707
- No short-term relationships.

38:27.709 --> 38:31.343
- A man of your success,

38:31.345 --> 38:34.112
your power?
- Good health

38:34.114 --> 38:36.681
makes all the difference,
my dear --

38:36.683 --> 38:38.849
even this late in life.

38:38.851 --> 38:42.919
- It's not that late.

38:42.921 --> 38:46.588
- Forgive me, I...

38:48.358 --> 38:50.791
I'm not in the habit
of opening up,

38:50.793 --> 38:53.794
even after two cocktails.

38:53.796 --> 38:56.263
- Me neither.

39:00.935 --> 39:03.702
How about a third?
(snorting)

39:03.704 --> 39:06.638
- It would put me
right to sleep.

39:06.640 --> 39:09.641
- So, where do you sleep?

39:09.643 --> 39:11.876
- My bedroom is
right above this room.

39:11.878 --> 39:13.878
- Can I...

39:13.880 --> 39:16.614
Can I see?

39:20.252 --> 39:22.151
- This was more of

39:22.153 --> 39:24.553
a hospital room
than a proper bedroom

39:24.555 --> 39:26.788
for most of my adult life.

39:39.736 --> 39:42.570
- Needs a woman's touch.

39:42.572 --> 39:46.306
- Oh, my dear!
You are simply exquisite.

39:48.243 --> 39:51.077
But I'm certain
I would only disappoint.

39:51.079 --> 39:53.913
- Shut up. Just shut up,

39:53.915 --> 39:57.449
Eldritch.

39:57.451 --> 39:59.484
- ♪ There you'll be ♪

39:59.486 --> 40:03.387
♪ Just waiting for me ♪

40:05.157 --> 40:07.824
♪ Though this ends my song ♪

40:07.826 --> 40:11.693
♪ And all else is gone ♪

40:11.695 --> 40:14.495
♪ My love ♪

40:18.533 --> 40:21.000
- His disappearance coincided

40:21.002 --> 40:24.335
with the fall
of the Roman Empire.

40:26.138 --> 40:28.638
While his immediate fate
was unknown,

40:28.640 --> 40:31.774
sightings persisted
throughout Eurasia

40:31.776 --> 40:34.009
over centuries.

40:34.011 --> 40:35.977
Yet to this day,

40:35.979 --> 40:39.213
no record exists to explain
where he came from

40:39.215 --> 40:42.149
nor how he was created.

40:42.151 --> 40:45.785
Perhaps a clue
lies in the nickname

40:45.787 --> 40:48.187
given to him by his sponsor,

40:48.189 --> 40:51.056
Senator Sertorius:

40:51.058 --> 40:54.225
"The Born."

40:56.329 --> 40:58.528
- I don't understand.

41:00.532 --> 41:03.699
Is that a legend,
or is it real?

41:05.369 --> 41:08.737
- The answer to both questions
is yes.

41:18.514 --> 41:20.780
<i> (Rock & Roll</i> by
the Velvet Underground playing)

41:28.422 --> 41:31.756
- You OK, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

41:33.559 --> 41:36.092
Mm...

41:36.094 --> 41:38.994
Bartender made me promise
I'd sip this,

41:38.996 --> 41:41.363
but, uh, booze is meant
to make you

41:41.365 --> 41:43.698
feel good, not taste good.

41:43.700 --> 41:47.501
- DC was that bad, huh?

41:47.503 --> 41:50.269
- Worse.

41:52.106 --> 41:54.773
So...

41:54.775 --> 41:58.276
Dutch's roommate Nikki, huh?

41:58.278 --> 42:00.478
- Yeah.

42:00.480 --> 42:02.947
"I specialize

42:02.949 --> 42:07.517
in passionate,
destructive relationships."

42:07.519 --> 42:11.921
I guess it was
never meant to be.

42:14.158 --> 42:16.158
- It's funny; you don't
strike me as a quitter.

42:16.160 --> 42:18.827
- I think sometimes
people quit on you,

42:18.829 --> 42:22.397
you know?

42:22.399 --> 42:26.534
So Washington, DC
didn't work out.

42:28.304 --> 42:31.038
What are you going to do now?

42:38.547 --> 42:40.980
- I'm going to kill
Eldritch Palmer.

42:45.686 --> 42:48.720
