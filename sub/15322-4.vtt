WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:05.916
Are you a virgin?

00:11.428 --> 00:13.635
Why are you crying,
little girl?

00:20.270 --> 00:22.306
You recognize the voice?

00:24.066 --> 00:25.556
Where did you get this?

00:25.567 --> 00:27.728
Goldie's apartment.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.522
Sound like him to you?

00:32.533 --> 00:34.114
I don't know.

00:38.455 --> 00:42.039
Did Kallie ever tell you
about making tapes like these?

00:44.503 --> 00:47.210
I knew some kids who would do
things like this, but...

00:47.297 --> 00:49.083
not Kallie.

00:49.132 --> 00:52.340
She wouldn't do nothing
like this ever.

00:52.386 --> 00:55.469
Do you know
where this place is?

00:55.514 --> 00:56.970
That hotel.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.506
Queens whatever dump
run by that crazy old bitch.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.141
- Mama Dips?
- Yeah.

01:01.186 --> 01:02.642
I'll bring this
downstairs to Tech,

01:02.688 --> 01:04.178
maybe run it
through voice recognition,

01:04.273 --> 01:06.730
see if it's a match to Goldie.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.979
What's up?

01:10.028 --> 01:11.768
That's my ring.

01:11.822 --> 01:14.279
Gave it to her.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.440
When?

01:16.493 --> 01:18.108
Three days ago.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.072
Last time I saw her.

01:21.290 --> 01:22.780
We're gonna need
a search warrant.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.076
I got the hook-up
with the judge.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.119
I'll call Skinner.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.419
You think she's at Mama Dips'?

01:26.461 --> 01:28.122
- You go home, Bullet.
- Wait.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.787
I'll be back, okay?

01:30.841 --> 01:33.878
Just wait here.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.676
Remember me, Mama San?

01:43.729 --> 01:45.310
Now what?

01:45.355 --> 01:48.142
We got that search warrant
you were asking about.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.727
I don't give a damn
what you got.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.858
You could either give us
the master key,

01:51.903 --> 01:54.485
or we're gonna kick in
every door in this flophouse.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.146
Get off of my property.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.064
That's how you want
to play it, baby?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.574
All right.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.360
Go.

02:01.413 --> 02:02.619
All right, move, move.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.500
I didn't do anything,
all right?!

02:11.882 --> 02:13.372
We checked the west end
of the building.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.668
We're moving on
to the east side.

02:14.718 --> 02:15.924
What are you looking at?

02:15.969 --> 02:16.924
Nothing.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.176
Open that door.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.169
Screw you.

02:20.599 --> 02:21.839
No!

02:21.892 --> 02:23.382
Sit down!

02:23.435 --> 02:24.675
This is my property!

02:24.728 --> 02:26.218
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

02:26.271 --> 02:28.557
What is that?

02:28.607 --> 02:30.723
It's coming from
behind that wall.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.895
Holder. False panel.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.017
You're gonna be seeing

03:53.066 --> 03:55.102
a whole lot more of us now,
my friend.

03:55.152 --> 03:58.394
We're gonna be best buddies
by the time we kill ya.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.566
You're gonna have to work
a whole lot harder next time,

04:00.615 --> 04:02.025
you want to get out of here.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.067
Man wasn't trying to kill
himself, you damn redneck.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.783
Just showing he don't care
about nothin' or no one.

04:08.832 --> 04:09.992
He cut out that tattoo

04:10.041 --> 04:12.327
so y'all ain't got nothin'
to hold over him.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.492
No point of weakness.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.285
Shut up, Hill.
Go back to bed.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.503
Ah, hell, no.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.708
Open 204!

04:17.758 --> 04:19.123
Free country.
I do what I like.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.461
Ain't that right, Big Noise?

04:22.262 --> 04:24.048
Close 204!

04:33.023 --> 04:36.311
It's my legal obligation to
make sure the state kills you.

04:36.359 --> 04:39.851
That man like
a champion gladiator.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.691
You're just like Spartacus,
ain't you?

04:41.740 --> 04:42.729
You Spartacus?

04:42.783 --> 04:46.526
Yeah, you Spartacus.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.864
You be pretending
like you don't like me,

04:48.914 --> 04:50.199
but I got you.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.658
That's right.

04:56.755 --> 05:00.418
It's her hotel where they film
the porn tapes.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.755
Goldie the pimp--
was that his voice on the tapes?

05:03.804 --> 05:05.669
The voice match
was inconclusive.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.932
It's a crap recording,
so it's tough to match.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.134
I don't think it's him.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.344
Mm.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.054
We do know that our missing
girl, Kallie Leeds,

05:12.062 --> 05:13.393
was at the hotel the night
she disappeared,

05:13.438 --> 05:14.723
making one of those tapes.

05:14.731 --> 05:18.440
Did we positively ID the Leeds
girl as one of our bodies?

05:18.443 --> 05:19.603
No.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.317
Her mom says she isn't missing.

05:21.363 --> 05:25.356
Do we have any of our confirmed
dead girls on the porn tapes?

05:28.787 --> 05:30.618
All right, you and Holder,

05:30.664 --> 05:32.950
get in there and have a talk
with Madam Dibs

05:32.999 --> 05:34.614
or whatever the hell
her name is.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.703
Holder can do it,

05:35.752 --> 05:37.162
and Reddick's en route,

05:37.170 --> 05:39.707
so maybe Ijust...
sit this one out?

05:40.841 --> 05:43.298
Is there a problem?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.549
No.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.552
'Course not.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.717
Look, I don't care who does it.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.599
Just get it done
before she lawyers up.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.357
Nothing I hate more

06:01.361 --> 06:03.477
than being woken up in the
middle of the night for BS.

06:05.323 --> 06:08.565
We already talked to grandma.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.870
Watch wonder boy charm
the bloomers off her.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.652
He's getting pretty good at it.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.370
Well, he's learning from a pro.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.872
Finally.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.166
Yep. You said it.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.952
You said you saw Kallie Leeds

06:21.006 --> 06:23.042
in the hotel parking lot
that night.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.791
You forgot to mention
the Oscar-winning performance

06:25.844 --> 06:27.380
in the back room, though.

06:27.429 --> 06:30.546
Those kids pay me
20 bucks to crash.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.840
I don't ask what they're doing.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.677
Yeah, that'l/ hold up.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.016
Hidden panel, secret room,

06:39.065 --> 06:41.442
and you don't know nothin'?

06:41.443 --> 06:42.853
Yeah.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.191
Who's Kallie Leeds' costar?

06:47.240 --> 06:49.231
Perv asking the questions?

06:49.326 --> 06:52.068
It was me.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.031
You?

06:55.916 --> 06:58.749
So you’re the man
asking the questions.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.535
I'm a heavy smoker.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.045
So it's a one-woman
operation, huh?

07:04.090 --> 07:06.923
You find the girls,
you ask them questions,

07:06.968 --> 07:08.208
you film it--
you get off on it?

07:08.261 --> 07:09.296
That's right.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.213
Why is that so hard to believe?

07:12.265 --> 07:13.926
I'm a modern woman.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.135
I do it all.

07:15.143 --> 07:19.386
Now, where’s my soda?

07:19.439 --> 07:22.931
You promised
you’d get me a soda.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.944
Let her sit for a couple
of days.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.904
Maybe she'll have
a change of heart.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.285
But what if Kallie's
still alive,

07:35.330 --> 07:37.036
being held out there somewhere?

07:37.082 --> 07:39.448
Then Goldie will lead us
to her.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.916
And in the meantime,
we wait for that to happen?

07:41.962 --> 07:43.748
What if Goldie's
not the killer?

07:43.755 --> 07:46.246
We just wait for the next girl
to show up dead?

07:46.299 --> 07:47.880
In the meantime,

07:47.926 --> 07:50.417
get a warrant
for Goldie's juvie records,

07:50.470 --> 07:53.337
your buddy, Judge Elliot,
gets to court at 7:00.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.722
You and me,
we'll have a talk with him.

07:55.767 --> 07:59.055
I think I'll go back
to her mom and have a talk.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.641
What's gonna change
from yesterday?

08:08.488 --> 08:11.696
She's been a murder cop,
what, six years?

08:11.700 --> 08:13.656
So what?
She's good at it.

08:13.702 --> 08:16.910
I've forgotten more convictions
than she'll ever have.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.996
Yeah, well, you're a lot--
a lot older.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.507
Get off me.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.185
You find Kallie?

08:48.695 --> 08:50.060
Go on.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.900
Go on.
Live a little.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.065
That's nasty.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.733
Ain't you got any normal food
around here?

08:56.745 --> 08:58.076
Like chips or something?

08:58.079 --> 09:01.116
Might as well be mainlining
8-ball with that stuff.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.997
I don't do none of that.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.500
My body's a temple.

09:08.506 --> 09:11.043
Suit yourself, Bullet.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.344
Man, you look like a rabbit.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.476
Like some big, hairless,
albino Bugs Bunny.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.978
All right, I'm cool with that.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.309
See, I like rabbits.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.064
Bugs Bunny's the bomb.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.559
You know rabbits
got three eyelids

09:30.612 --> 09:32.148
and their teeth
never stop growing?

09:32.197 --> 09:34.438
Yeah.
But they can't puke.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.322
Don't got enough
stomach muscles.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.988
Damn.
How you know that?

09:39.037 --> 09:40.777
You watch
the Discovery Channel?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.240
No.

09:42.332 --> 09:45.415
I learned it in zoology class
in my boarding school.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.168
All right.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.082
Anyway...

09:54.135 --> 09:57.298
I gotta jet.

09:57.347 --> 10:00.180
You stay safe
out there, you hear?

10:06.147 --> 10:07.432
Look, I gotta go to work.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.814
I got three blow-dries
back to back.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.440
I told you Kallie's fine.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.317
We're gonna need
your daughter's dental records.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.857
Yeah, well,
good luck with that.

10:14.906 --> 10:16.237
She's never been to no dentist.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.609
Her teeth are perfect.

10:17.659 --> 10:21.652
Your daughter's a prostitute.
Are you aware of that?

10:21.663 --> 10:25.155
It's just a phase.
She'll grow out of it.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.827
Ijust started this new job,

10:26.835 --> 10:28.325
and the owner's
a real prick, so--

10:28.378 --> 10:29.458
Sit down.

10:29.504 --> 10:30.584
Excuse me?

10:30.588 --> 10:32.203
I don't have to hear this
in my own home.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.458
Yeah, you do, actually.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.214
Sit down.
I'm not done with you.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.568
Are you a virgin?

10:58.116 --> 11:01.404
This is where your daughter was
three days ago.

11:01.452 --> 11:02.578
Why are you crying,
little girl?

11:02.620 --> 11:05.657
Do you recognize his voice?

11:09.043 --> 11:11.750
Does your daughter have a pimp?

11:18.469 --> 11:21.677
Did she ever mention
somebody named Goldie?

11:26.853 --> 11:29.094
Her friend Bullet said Kallie
was on her way here

11:29.147 --> 11:30.307
the night she disappeared

11:30.356 --> 11:32.347
when she couldn't get a bed
at the shelter.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.686
Thought maybe she would
crash at home.

11:38.448 --> 11:39.563
What?

11:42.702 --> 11:45.660
I told herI had somebody
coming over.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.740
My boyfriend.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.656
So she did come here
that night?

11:51.294 --> 11:53.501
I locked the door,

11:53.546 --> 11:56.538
and she knocked...

11:56.591 --> 11:59.549
and I didn't answer.

11:59.594 --> 12:02.085
So she went away.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.969
Look, the last time that she was
here, she stole $100,

12:06.976 --> 12:09.433
and I didn't see her
for days, all right?

12:09.479 --> 12:12.312
So if we're done here,
I-I got to go to work.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.910
See you at the hotel,
all right?

12:47.141 --> 12:49.553
Joaquin Phoenix
didn't go to school.

12:49.560 --> 12:53.018
I mean, he lived
on the streets panhandling.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.273
You know, and he lived free.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.443
What are we doing here?

13:00.446 --> 13:02.107
I thought we were going
to the office.

13:02.156 --> 13:05.114
I need to talk.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.401
I got bad news.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.570
Your piss test came back dirty.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.738
That's impossible!

13:11.791 --> 13:13.702
What can I say?
The dye don't lie.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.787
I've been totally clean,
I swear!

13:15.795 --> 13:18.002
Look, I--
I can't go back to juvie.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.338
I'm supposed to go to LA
next month.

13:20.383 --> 13:23.295
I got my headshots
and my hair and everything.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.005
I got plans!

13:25.013 --> 13:26.128
Come on, man.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.341
You know I've been
keeping clean, right?

13:28.391 --> 13:30.097
You kids.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.600
You're all the same.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.345
No sense of responsibility.

13:35.398 --> 13:36.934
No sense of decency,

13:36.983 --> 13:40.646
or how your actions
affect those around you.

13:53.082 --> 13:56.415
Not that.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.997
Get in the back.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.456
Take your pants down.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.881
No--

14:00.923 --> 14:03.665
I don't do that.
I'm-- I'm not gay.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.254
Neither am I.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.225
Your antibiotic.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.931
Doc says you got to take it
twice a day

14:15.980 --> 14:17.845
or you're gonna get
some kind of infection.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.780
Come on, will you just take it?

14:41.381 --> 14:44.293
That's second-level shit
right there.

14:44.342 --> 14:45.923
Not a smart move, Seward.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.300
You're not careful,
you are gonna get an infection.

14:48.346 --> 14:50.758
And you're gonna have pus
coming out of your willie

14:50.807 --> 14:51.967
or some damn thing.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.927
Shut it, Hi!!!

14:55.353 --> 14:57.685
"Pus coming out
of your willie."

14:57.730 --> 14:59.436
What's he think you got,
the clap?

15:00.858 --> 15:03.315
You right about them
antibiotics, though.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.567
I never take them myself.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.897
They give you the runs.

15:05.905 --> 15:09.022
I remember I had green pus
coming out of my ear once.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.566
They ass didn't want to give me
no Q-tips,

15:11.619 --> 15:12.904
so I started digging.

15:12.954 --> 15:15.036
You know how I know
you're not innocent?

15:15.039 --> 15:17.155
It's because
you never shut up about it.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.698
It's quoting your transcript,

15:18.751 --> 15:21.413
talking about your lawyers
going over your evidence,

15:21.421 --> 15:22.627
just on and on and on

15:22.672 --> 15:24.287
about how you're gaming
the system.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.581
Well, an innocent man
doesn't need to game nothing

15:26.634 --> 15:28.670
because he knows the truth,
and the truth is

15:28.719 --> 15:32.632
that we've all got
a death sentence...

15:32.682 --> 15:34.843
whether you're innocent
or guilty.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.634
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about, Spartacus.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.850
See, it's the innocent man
that gotta speak up

15:40.898 --> 15:42.980
because it's the only hope
we got.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.566
"Hope."
Hope's the same as faith.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.024
That bitch will kill you faster
than this place will.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.120
Off of dental records,

15:55.163 --> 15:57.905
we've gotten seven
positive IDs so far.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.996
The killer is not particular
about the race of his victim.

16:02.044 --> 16:05.628
The only consistencies
are gender and age range.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.122
Okay, you two got a connect
between the porn tapes

16:08.176 --> 16:09.461
and our dead girls?

16:09.510 --> 16:12.217
We're still trying to ID
the male voice on the tapes.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.672
And although we haven't
positively ID'd her body,

16:15.683 --> 16:17.969
our missing girl, Kallie Leeds,

16:17.977 --> 16:20.639
fits the profile
of our known victims.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.644
So the mother confirmed
the daughter is missing.

16:22.690 --> 16:26.308
No. In fact, her mom saw her
that night around 1:00 AM.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.521
They locked her
out of the house.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.186
So, the girl is not missing.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.321
She is, we believe.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.027
She made one of those porn tapes
the night she disappeared.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.236
At the Queens Motel.

16:35.286 --> 16:37.618
We got a bunch of pervs
and the owner, Margery Dips.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.738
We believe she's protecting
the film-maker.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.701
Unless you have
specific charges

16:41.751 --> 16:42.706
beyond solicitation,

16:42.752 --> 16:44.288
Lieutenant, my office suggests

16:44.337 --> 16:46.168
you cut your johns
and junkies loose.

16:46.214 --> 16:47.795
The DA's focusing on Dips.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.795
She's the big fish.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.377
Connect it to the kiddie porn.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.007
Ag reed. Okay.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.089
That pimp that we stimulated
and let roam.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.514
Sheldon "Goldie" Willis.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.421
Has an impressive
arrest history

16:57.475 --> 16:59.386
for pandering
and statutory rape.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.391
Just opened up
his juvie records,

17:01.395 --> 17:03.351
and I'm liking him
more and more.

17:03.397 --> 17:06.139
Age 15 while attempting to rape
an 11-year-old,

17:06.192 --> 17:08.308
Goldie held a knife
to her throat

17:08.361 --> 17:10.101
and threatened to cut her
ear to ear if she moved.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.610
Still got eyes
on his residence?

17:11.614 --> 17:12.979
Been holed up for the last 24.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.533
He's got to make a move
eventuaHy.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.076
So far,

17:16.118 --> 17:17.733
we don't have any
tangible connection

17:17.787 --> 17:19.197
between Goldie
and our dead girls.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.203
Besides the fact that they're
hookers and he's a pimp?

17:22.333 --> 17:23.368
Okay, that's it.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.749
I want shift reports
around the clock,

17:25.795 --> 17:26.750
every 24 hours.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.340
These are the screen grabs

17:37.390 --> 17:39.176
of all the girls
from the porn tapes.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.298
Sorry it took so long.

17:40.351 --> 17:41.932
Any matches to our dead girls?

17:41.936 --> 17:43.346
No. Sorry.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.556
Thanks.

18:24.562 --> 18:26.098
Hey, Holder, come here.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.107
What do you think?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.734
Maybe.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.494
Wait.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.088
Yeah.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.678
Same guy, same place,
Queens Hotel.

19:04.727 --> 19:07.139
Maybe Vice can help us ID him?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.807
It's gonna be tough.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.313
Both this girl and Kallie were
with him-- both are dead.

19:11.359 --> 19:13.645
Until we got a body,
Kallie Leeds ain't a victim.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.525
Just heard from Nance.
Goldie's on the move.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.941
Let's go.

19:33.547 --> 19:36.539
You know how many rivers
down the wall of my cell?

19:36.550 --> 19:37.835
322.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.752
I know this because I count them
all every single day.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.511
Day in, day out.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.137
It never changes.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.094
I mean, this is what I do.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.758
You know?

19:50.064 --> 19:52.180
You really are Spartacus.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.647
How come you ain't got no ink?

19:53.693 --> 19:55.103
Ain't got no tats or nothin'.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.188
You want to see my tattoos?

20:04.662 --> 20:08.029
This here's
my Mexican mafia tattoo.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.542
Black guerillas.

20:17.591 --> 20:21.834
Ah, and this...

20:26.225 --> 20:29.183
my daddy gave me.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.220
The day I was sentenced
to Cedar Creek.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.437
Adult gen pop.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.097
Iwas 16.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.733
He took a baseball bat
to my head.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.019
Beat the hell out of me.

20:40.072 --> 20:43.906
Said his son
wasn't ever gonna be a pussy.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.860
I'd go in a man,

20:47.872 --> 20:51.865
and I'd stay a man
till the day I died.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.959
Yeah?

20:56.005 --> 20:58.621
And how is that
working for you?

21:45.346 --> 21:47.302
Thought
you were off the shiz.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.684
Lyric know you're using
her money for that?

21:53.729 --> 21:56.220
You oughta be sellin'
your own ass

21:56.232 --> 21:59.144
if you're gonna use her scratch
to get loaded.

21:59.193 --> 22:00.603
Ain't your PO making you test?

22:00.653 --> 22:01.893
I ain't going back there.

22:01.946 --> 22:05.313
Ever. Ever.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.780
What's wrong?

22:08.744 --> 22:10.780
Just leave me alone.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.697
Yo, Twitch.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.616
Twitch! Twitch,
where you going?!

22:20.798 --> 22:24.211
Do you recognize this voice
from any of your Vice jobs?

22:24.301 --> 22:26.678
This looks home-grown.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.921
Most of the hard candy we find
is a little more professional.

22:32.476 --> 22:34.558
We're looking for a connection

22:34.562 --> 22:36.928
between the guy
asking the question

22:36.981 --> 22:38.391
and the killer's vics.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.182
We've got at least one,
maybe two matches.

22:43.571 --> 22:46.358
I don't-- I don't recognize
any of these...

22:46.365 --> 22:48.526
films...

22:48.576 --> 22:51.158
and I've seen a lot
of this amateur crap.

22:55.457 --> 22:58.119
But this girl.

22:58.168 --> 22:59.374
I know her.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.118
Yeah?

23:01.171 --> 23:03.378
Tiffany something or other.

23:03.424 --> 23:06.006
Picked her up last week
for solicitation.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.086
She's alive?

23:07.136 --> 23:08.626
And kicking.

23:08.679 --> 23:10.840
So, what was his name--

23:10.890 --> 23:13.051
the guy who made the video?

23:13.100 --> 23:14.761
I don't know.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.096
That was a long time ago.

23:18.606 --> 23:21.222
So, tell me
what you do remember.

23:21.275 --> 23:24.233
He was white.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.311
Kind of short.

23:26.322 --> 23:30.110
Nice enough,
said I reminded him of Rihanna.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.948
Where'd you meet him?

23:31.952 --> 23:33.362
On the street.

23:33.370 --> 23:36.237
Like how I "meet"
everyone else.

23:36.332 --> 23:39.540
And what kind of car
did he drive?

23:39.585 --> 23:41.496
I don't know.

23:41.545 --> 23:45.413
What happened after you made
the video with him?

23:45.466 --> 23:48.173
He let me stay
in that motel room.

23:48.218 --> 23:52.928
It was raining.
He bought us some Carl's Jr.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.923
Let me have his fries.

23:54.975 --> 23:55.964
Mama!

23:56.018 --> 23:57.804
It was nice.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.684
Mama.

23:59.730 --> 24:00.845
Mama.

24:00.898 --> 24:03.310
Hey,baby.
Mama's coming.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.150
He was one of the good ones.

24:22.503 --> 24:23.834
Wait for him to come out.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.712
Number 314,
you got eyes on the suspect?

24:26.757 --> 24:29.464
Yeah, we got eyes
on Goldie. Over.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.422
You don't have to be so hard
on Linden, man.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.635
She's not that bad.

24:40.938 --> 24:43.554
Here's the thing.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.984
Linden's never worked
sex crimes,

24:45.985 --> 24:48.476
has no idea
how these people think.

24:48.529 --> 24:51.020
I teach the freakin' class
on this.

24:51.073 --> 24:54.406
You've given this an awful lot
of thought, Carl.

24:54.410 --> 24:57.026
Yeah, well...

24:57.037 --> 24:59.198
Got 23 years in this bureau.

24:59.206 --> 25:02.664
She's been handling dead bodies
for like a minute.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.122
Want to put your career
in her hands?

25:05.170 --> 25:06.751
What the hell
you talking about?

25:06.797 --> 25:08.708
I'm not putting my career
in anyone’s hands.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.167
There he is.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.092
Who's that with him?

25:14.138 --> 25:15.127
It's a woman.

25:15.139 --> 25:17.972
Suspect is leaving
Yasler Terrace,

25:17.975 --> 25:19.511
heading east on Sherman.

25:19.560 --> 25:20.549
He is not alone.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.854
He's got an unidentified
woman in the car.

25:30.279 --> 25:31.735
He's headed to the dump site.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.950
We need all available units
in the West Seattle area.

25:37.995 --> 25:40.111
Suspect is heading towards
the retention pond

25:40.164 --> 25:41.404
off Grover Road.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.322
He has an unidentified female
in the vehicle.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.615
Copy that.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.752
What the hell is he doing?

25:50.883 --> 25:54.296
Yo! I got an official
announcement.

25:54.344 --> 25:56.630
My name is Goldie Willis.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.467
This is my mom,
and I'm the serial killer.

26:02.144 --> 26:05.181
Goldie Willis
ain’t no pied piper,

26:05.272 --> 26:08.514
leading little girls
to their death.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.558
They’re not even telling you
about this other girl

26:10.611 --> 26:12.351
that's missing that could be
in the hands

26:12.404 --> 26:13.610
of the real killer right now.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.611
- How old is she?
- How long has she been missing?

26:15.657 --> 26:17.238
Sorry, we don ’t have anything
for you right now.

26:17.326 --> 26:18.987
We don 't have any comment.

26:19.036 --> 26:20.776
This all goes back, of course,

26:20.788 --> 26:22.574
to the 17 girls
who have been killed

26:22.581 --> 26:24.913
and the possibility another
teen may now be missing

26:24.958 --> 26:26.539
and could be
the latest victim...

26:26.543 --> 26:28.499
There you are.

26:28.545 --> 26:31.378
What happened to you
last night, baby?

26:31.423 --> 26:35.587
Yeah, I waited up for you.
You never even called.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.298
Sure.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.589
I can go tonight.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.638
You should have seen
Hill and Seward

26:45.687 --> 26:48.019
out there in the yard today
yukking it up.

26:48.065 --> 26:49.896
Regular A-hole
buddies now.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.352
Gonna have to think
what I'm gonna do about that,

26:54.404 --> 26:55.655
'cause I don't like it.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.490
How'd it go
with the medication?

27:01.912 --> 27:04.904
Yeah.
Fine. No problem.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.538
Good.

27:09.419 --> 27:10.579
What's the matter with you?

27:12.089 --> 27:14.045
Nothing.

27:14.091 --> 27:15.547
Double shift.

27:15.592 --> 27:19.176
Just... psyching myself up
to go home.

27:19.221 --> 27:23.385
Donna keeps asking me questions
about this place, and...

27:23.433 --> 27:26.561
I just don't want
to talk about it.

27:26.603 --> 27:29.015
Well, how about this?

27:29.064 --> 27:31.851
You come to my place,
you get a beer.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.106
I live three miles away.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.983
Talk to Donna and the kid
tomorrow.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.019
No point in going home anyway.
Let's go.

27:40.409 --> 27:41.945
Ijust need one more bag.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.029
No, you don't.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.319
Smurf says Nico's selling
at Freeway Park.

27:45.372 --> 27:46.452
Freeway park?

27:46.498 --> 27:47.704
You're not going
to Freeway Park.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.075
Hey, yo, watch it, click!

27:51.128 --> 27:52.709
Hey!

27:52.754 --> 27:53.960
That's Tank's park.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.630
He don't own the park.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.836
He'll straight murder you,
fool!

28:00.762 --> 28:03.094
Twit-- Twitch.
Damn it.

28:03.098 --> 28:05.180
Lyric is probably waiting
for you back at the hotel.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.965
Let's just go back there, okay?

28:10.522 --> 28:12.558
Hey, yo, spare some change?

28:12.608 --> 28:13.973
No. Get lost!

28:13.984 --> 28:15.315
Douchebag!
Hey,hey.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.772
Hey, you piss off, man!

28:19.907 --> 28:21.613
Just let it go.

28:27.581 --> 28:29.446
Twitch.

28:29.499 --> 28:31.911
I hope you like it spicy.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.212
Frank loves his chili fierce.

28:34.254 --> 28:35.869
Thank you.

28:35.923 --> 28:38.084
Can’t keep it in. Finally
a line change is in order.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.873
Frank Jr., come on in here.
Have dinner with your dad.

28:39.927 --> 28:40.962
I'm doing homework.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.300
Frankie, get in here.
Finish the game.

28:42.304 --> 28:45.717
Got an algebra test
tomorrow, dad.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.715
Kid's smart.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.138
He gets A's in everything,
not like the old man.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.306
Going out for football
next year.

28:52.356 --> 28:53.687
Oh, yeah?

28:53.732 --> 28:55.643
I played
high-school football.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.102
I was a defensive tackle.

28:57.152 --> 28:59.768
Well, you got the shoulders
for it.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.812
Annie.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.025
Get me a couple beers.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.281
Those are the last ones.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.442
You know what? I got a half one.
I'm good.

29:06.495 --> 29:07.905
What, are you kidding me?

29:07.913 --> 29:09.073
We're just getting started.

29:09.122 --> 29:11.249
I got a couple cases
in the garage.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.869
I-- Really, I'm--

29:15.128 --> 29:18.586
He never has anyone over.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.873
Especially a Green Tag.

29:22.928 --> 29:25.385
Yeah, well, I don't--
I don't mean to intrude.

29:25.430 --> 29:28.797
No. No, it's good for Frank Jr.
to see his dad laugh...

29:28.809 --> 29:30.299
occasionally.

29:30.352 --> 29:32.468
I mean, well,
you know how it is.

29:32.521 --> 29:34.557
You guys are gone all the time,

29:34.564 --> 29:35.770
and then, you know,

29:35.774 --> 29:38.060
when you're home,
it ain't much fun.

29:41.363 --> 29:44.275
Yeah.
I know how that is.

29:44.324 --> 29:45.700
And these double shifts--

29:45.742 --> 29:47.448
I mean, they're hell
on a marriage.

29:47.494 --> 29:50.782
Most nights he's gone, I sleep
right here on the couch.

29:50.831 --> 29:53.413
I hate sleeping in that bed...

29:53.458 --> 29:54.447
alone.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.202
Hey.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.174
Don't fool me for a minute.

30:13.437 --> 30:15.803
Seward didn't take
his medication, did he?

30:25.198 --> 30:26.904
No.

30:28.952 --> 30:32.069
I tried, but he--
he just wouldn't do it.

30:39.713 --> 30:43.126
Twitch. Twitch!
Come on! Twitch!

30:43.175 --> 30:46.713
Hey, bitches,
stay out of our park!

30:46.720 --> 30:49.006
Ain't your park, A-hole.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.012
Punk-ass queers!

30:51.058 --> 30:52.764
Yo, who you calling
a queer, bitch?

30:52.809 --> 30:54.845
Yo, you and
your dog-faced midget!

30:54.895 --> 30:56.681
Yo, bite me!

30:56.730 --> 30:57.685
Screw you.

30:57.731 --> 31:00.643
Twitch, turn and bail.

31:01.943 --> 31:04.605
Come on, man, this is crazy.
Tank's gonna kill you.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.986
Pussy.

31:07.032 --> 31:09.694
You know what?
Fine, get yourself killed!

31:09.701 --> 31:11.532
This here is my park!

31:13.580 --> 31:15.445
Twitch.

31:15.499 --> 31:17.455
Twitch!

31:21.004 --> 31:22.460
These cops here,

31:22.506 --> 31:25.418
they've brought me in three
times on bogus charges...

31:25.467 --> 31:28.254
You mind telling me what
the hell happened out there?

31:28.303 --> 31:29.588
Following the suspect.

31:29.638 --> 31:32.926
You let this clown
hijack your investigation.

31:37.604 --> 31:40.516
The public's panicking.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.476
I've got the Mayor on my ass

31:42.526 --> 31:44.642
about finding
some pied piper...

31:44.694 --> 31:46.901
who now has a nickname,

31:46.947 --> 31:48.653
thanks to your pimp.

31:48.698 --> 31:51.189
Loo, it was your idea
to cut him loose.

31:53.745 --> 31:54.905
I thought it was a good idea.

31:54.913 --> 31:58.405
At least now the scumbag's
behind bars.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.406
Yeah.

32:01.503 --> 32:04.461
You, you have any good news
for me?

32:04.506 --> 32:05.962
No.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.383
Swell.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.130
Chief.

32:13.557 --> 32:17.300
This is just... great.

32:17.310 --> 32:18.925
Great.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.816
Ijust talked to this girl,
Tiffany,

32:30.866 --> 32:32.572
who was one of the porn actors.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.528
She's alive, huh?

32:34.578 --> 32:37.945
There goes your "find the porn
maker, find the killer" theory.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.537
She says she can't remember
the film-maker,

32:39.583 --> 32:40.868
but I don't buy it.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.123
I'm pretty sure they had some
sort of relationship,

32:42.169 --> 32:43.284
and I want to know who he is.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.872
But he didn't kill her.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.957
What's your theory about that?

32:46.965 --> 32:50.298
I got a feeling my girl
knows more than she's saying.

32:50.343 --> 32:52.595
I want to have another go
at her,

32:52.637 --> 32:54.468
and I could use your help.

32:54.514 --> 32:56.015
For God's sake. You know what?

32:56.057 --> 32:57.968
You should go over that list
ofjohns

32:57.976 --> 32:59.841
arrested for beating up
prostitutes.

32:59.853 --> 33:01.764
See if any of them
has any connections

33:01.813 --> 33:02.973
to medical facilities.

33:03.023 --> 33:05.765
That'd be a better use
of your time, wouldn't it?

33:05.817 --> 33:08.399
Carl, why are you still here?

33:08.445 --> 33:11.152
What?

33:11.198 --> 33:13.735
What are you doing here?

33:13.783 --> 33:15.523
I mean, really.

33:15.577 --> 33:19.991
Haven't you ever wondered
why you never made sergeant?

33:19.998 --> 33:21.579
I'll tell you why.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.866
Because 23 years of experience,

33:23.919 --> 33:26.160
and all you are is in the way.

33:40.602 --> 33:44.094
I'm talking to Skinner
about her.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.388
She's going 5150 on us.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.822
Yo, Linden.

34:07.796 --> 34:09.661
I'm coming with you.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.045
But I'm driving.

34:52.173 --> 34:53.674
Twitch?

34:53.717 --> 34:55.673
Oh, my God.
What happened?

34:55.719 --> 34:58.085
Dickhead went lookin' to score
in Freeway Park.

34:58.096 --> 35:01.429
Got his ass kicked.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.339
Look at me.

35:05.812 --> 35:09.646
I can't go to LA like this.

35:09.649 --> 35:11.640
Such a joke.

35:14.195 --> 35:16.151
You know what I'm gonna do?

35:16.197 --> 35:19.360
I'm-- I'm gonna
go to the drugstore

35:19.367 --> 35:20.868
and get some stuff...

35:20.910 --> 35:23.037
to put on that... cut.

35:23.079 --> 35:26.116
And...

35:26.166 --> 35:29.408
then I'll get some ice
from the liquor store

35:29.419 --> 35:33.003
and some band-aids...

35:33.048 --> 35:34.879
and some popsicles.

35:34.924 --> 35:37.006
Popsicles?

35:37.052 --> 35:38.167
For your lip.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.801
They'll make you
feel better, baby.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.466
I don't like orange.

35:42.474 --> 35:45.841
Okay.

35:45.894 --> 35:48.135
Then strawberry.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.979
They always got strawberry.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.203
It's gonna be okay, baby.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.849
I told you,
I don't remember his name.

36:27.894 --> 36:29.555
Look at this girl.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.595
Janice Gibbs.
14 years old.

36:31.648 --> 36:33.354
Had her head nearly cutoff.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.515
And-- and Marla Ritter.

36:34.567 --> 36:35.898
17 years old.

36:35.944 --> 36:38.902
Just had a baby when he drug her
out to the field and raped her.

36:38.947 --> 36:41.313
What you want me to do
about it?

36:41.366 --> 36:43.482
Each one of these girls
sat in that hotel room,

36:43.535 --> 36:44.900
answered those same questions,

36:44.911 --> 36:47.277
and then was given a happy meal,
just like you were.

36:47.330 --> 36:48.786
That's what men like this do.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.618
They make you think
that you're special,

36:50.667 --> 36:52.623
that you're the only one,
but it's not true.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.994
Get out of my house.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.880
It's too bad you grew up,
got old and pregnant.

36:58.925 --> 37:01.337
What would he think
if he saw you now?

37:09.936 --> 37:14.100
What that grown man
did to you...

37:14.149 --> 37:15.309
it's not right.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.973
Taking that from a kid.

37:17.026 --> 37:19.642
He didn't take anything
from me!

37:19.696 --> 37:23.063
He fed you.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.690
Said you were pretty.

37:25.744 --> 37:28.577
I was.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.782
Still are.

37:30.790 --> 37:35.784
I mean, look at you.
You got it going on, girl.

37:35.837 --> 37:37.748
Any man who would want
to dump you

37:37.797 --> 37:40.254
because you grew up
into a fine young woman...

37:42.510 --> 37:45.468
is crazy.

37:45.513 --> 37:48.926
Why would you want to protect
a man like that?

37:50.769 --> 37:53.181
The man says
if you want to be happy,

37:53.229 --> 37:54.844
free your heart from hatred

37:54.898 --> 37:56.684
and free your mind from worry.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.189
Like that's gonna work.

37:58.234 --> 37:59.644
I mean, it does for me.

37:59.694 --> 38:02.106
Every time I get
a janky-ass thought,

38:02.155 --> 38:04.362
Ijust think
about something else.

38:04.407 --> 38:06.443
Like what?

38:06.493 --> 38:08.734
Like, I name all 50 states

38:08.787 --> 38:12.575
and try to find one
that make me feel good.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.160
Detroit.

38:14.209 --> 38:16.325
My dad took me to a club
there once,

38:16.377 --> 38:17.753
and I heard James Brown.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.583
Man was like 70 years old
but could do a back flip,

38:20.632 --> 38:23.044
drop into the splits,
and come up singing.

38:23.051 --> 38:24.712
Detroit's not a state.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.334
That's not the point.

38:26.387 --> 38:29.754
Time to take your medication,
convict.

38:43.738 --> 38:46.229
Atta boy.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.198
Open 209.

38:58.711 --> 38:59.962
What's up, man?

39:00.004 --> 39:00.993
Take the pill.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.412
Be trippin', man.

39:02.465 --> 39:05.172
Hey, man, don't take that pill.

39:05.218 --> 39:07.300
Okay.

39:10.765 --> 39:13.723
Take your damn pill.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.133
Screw them, man.
Don't even take that pill.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.804
It's up to you, convict.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.598
I got nowhere to go.

39:24.112 --> 39:25.352
Aah!

39:28.700 --> 39:30.281
Like I said,

39:30.326 --> 39:31.441
I got nowhere to go.

39:48.678 --> 39:51.966
I knew you'd see it my way.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.218
Put him back in 209.

40:06.571 --> 40:09.278
I could have taken more.

40:09.324 --> 40:10.939
You didn't have to give in.

40:10.992 --> 40:13.574
You let them win.

40:15.705 --> 40:18.162
They won a long time ago.

40:22.128 --> 40:25.370
Joe Mills.
Joseph.

40:29.844 --> 40:32.130
So, what'd you say
to Carl, anyway?

40:32.180 --> 40:33.761
Nothing.

40:33.806 --> 40:35.421
He's gonna hate you.

40:35.475 --> 40:37.841
Not as much as he hates you.

40:42.732 --> 40:44.768
I can't guarantee
you're gonna make sergeant

40:44.817 --> 40:46.944
by working with me.

40:46.986 --> 40:49.193
What makes you think
I need your help?

40:53.159 --> 40:54.444
I hate to say it, Linden,

40:54.494 --> 40:56.450
but so far,
none of this porn stuff

40:56.454 --> 40:58.410
seems to lead back
to Trisha Seward.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.536
I know.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.322
If Seward didn't kill his wife,

41:01.334 --> 41:03.325
we're running out of time
to prove it.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.084
How we doing on Mills?

41:05.129 --> 41:06.835
Searching.

41:10.635 --> 41:13.172
What's up with that ADA anyway?

41:13.221 --> 41:14.836
You two a thing?

41:14.889 --> 41:15.878
You jealous?

41:24.357 --> 41:25.893
Son of a bitch!

41:25.900 --> 41:27.231
Mills?

41:27.276 --> 41:29.608
We took him in last night
at Hotel Mama's.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.861
Cut him loose six hours ago.
