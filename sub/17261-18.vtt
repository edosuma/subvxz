(Victoria)
<i>Hot in Cleveland</i> is recorded

00:04.754 --> 00:06.548
in front
of a live studio audience.

00:06.631 --> 00:08.717
Why am I getting
my picture taken?

00:08.800 --> 00:12.303
Well, it seems I've become
a bit of a local celebrity.

00:12.387 --> 00:14.806
{\an1}We're getting
an engagement portrait.

00:14.889 --> 00:19.060
My driver's license expired.

00:19.144 --> 00:23.148
I'm doing a nude calendar
for charity.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.404
What do you mean,
you're doing a nude calendar

00:29.487 --> 00:31.740
for charity?

00:31.823 --> 00:33.450
{\an1}First, we thought
of a bake sale.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.453
Good idea.
Do that.

00:36.536 --> 00:40.999
And then, we started
doing Jell-O shots.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.293
{\an3}When I saw the jiggle
in my glass,

00:43.376 --> 00:46.671
I came up with the idea.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.007
But can't you just cancel?

00:49.090 --> 00:50.550
You're the only ones
who know about it.

00:50.633 --> 00:54.304
Turn to page three.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.931
The mayor has agreed
to do a nude calendar

00:57.015 --> 00:59.309
to raise money for
the Cleveland animal shelter.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.643
It's in the papers?

01:00.727 --> 01:04.022
I drunk-dialed that in.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.234
Guess who just got
asked for their celebrity photo,

01:08.318 --> 01:09.194
and it's not Victoria.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.820
Is it you, Melanie?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.822
{\an3}Yes!

01:12.906 --> 01:14.199
Because of my radio show,

01:14.282 --> 01:15.784
{\an3}the dry cleaners
asked for my photo.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.328
{\an1}Ah, the first time
the dry cleaner

01:18.411 --> 01:21.456
{\an1}asks for your head shot--
I remember it well.

01:21.539 --> 01:24.834
{\an1}I was between David Hasselhoff
and Henry Winkler,

01:24.918 --> 01:29.172
{\an1}and ironically, a year later,
I was between them again.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.298
Oh, my God.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.341
What's wrong?

01:31.424 --> 01:33.176
Oh, that stupid Ohio DMV!

01:33.259 --> 01:34.844
{\an1}I went in
to renew my license,

01:34.928 --> 01:36.888
and they sent it back to me
with someone else's picture.

01:36.971 --> 01:40.517
{\an1}Look at that ugly,
old woman.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.268
{\an3}Victoria, honey,
that's you.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.353
{\an1}What?

01:46.648 --> 01:50.527
{\an1}I told them I required
the celebrity Photoshop package,

01:50.610 --> 01:54.197
you know, like they have
at the Beverly Hills DMV.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.366
{\an1}When I gave that greeter
outside $100,

01:56.449 --> 01:57.700
{\an1}he said
he'd take care of it.

01:57.784 --> 02:01.204
{\an3}They don't have
a greeter at the DMV.

02:01.287 --> 02:06.042
{\an1}That's what the sign said
on his shopping cart.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.752
{\an1}Bob and I found
a fantastic photographer

02:07.836 --> 02:09.044
for our engagement photo.

02:09.127 --> 02:10.045
He could take your picture.

02:10.128 --> 02:11.506
Oh, that'd be great.

02:11.589 --> 02:12.549
Now, and then I could take

02:12.632 --> 02:15.552
my own professionally done
head shot to the DMV.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.720
{\an3}And he could take shots
for our thing.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.055
What thing?

02:19.138 --> 02:22.308
We're posing nude
for the animals.

02:26.479 --> 02:29.107
Well, as long
as people don't have to see it.

{\an7}Can't you just smile and think
about how happy you are?

02:53.173 --> 02:54.757
{\an8}I'm sorry, Joy.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.719
{\an8}It's just, when I think about
how I really feel, you know--

02:57.802 --> 02:59.971
{\an9}about a guy like me getting
to marry a girl like you,

03:00.054 --> 03:01.431
{\an8}well, I just--

03:01.514 --> 03:05.101
{\an9}I can't believe how--
how lucky I am.

03:05.184 --> 03:07.478
{\an8}I need a minute.

{\an8}Aw, that's so sweet.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.316
{\an7}It is.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.776
{\an8}I know it's surprising--
his sensitive side,

03:13.860 --> 03:17.238
{\an8}seeing how tough and macho
he is on the outside.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.117
{\an8}We're talking about Bob,
right?

03:21.200 --> 03:24.704
{\an8}Of course.
I'll go check on him.

03:24.787 --> 03:26.289
{\an9}While we're waiting, do you want
to start on yours, Melanie?

03:26.372 --> 03:28.583
{\an7}Oh, yeah, sure.
It's a little chilly in here.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.418
{\an7}I'm just gonna put this shawl
around me while you set up.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.295
{\an8}- Okay.
- You know, it's weird.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.464
{\an8}I haven't had
a studio portrait taken

03:34.547 --> 03:37.008
{\an8}without my husband or my kids.

03:37.091 --> 03:38.927
{\an8}But I'm single now,
and that's okay.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.970
{\an7}It just feels like
there should be something

03:41.054 --> 03:41.971
{\an8}here next to me.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.141
{\an8}Well, hi, you.

03:45.224 --> 03:46.643
{\an8}What a sweet little kitty
you are.

03:46.726 --> 03:49.062
{\an8}What is your name?

03:51.230 --> 03:54.275
{\an8}Barney, well, that's a handsome
name for such a handsome fellow.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.821
Oh, God, Joy, without you,

03:58.905 --> 04:01.324
that could be me--

04:01.407 --> 04:04.994
{\an1}sad, alone,
talking to cats.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.163
I am not sad and alone.

04:07.246 --> 04:08.164
{\an3}(Ian)
Can we get a smile, Melanie?

04:08.247 --> 04:10.291
No, I don't think we can.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.798
To Cleveland's
calendar girls.

04:17.882 --> 04:23.054
You know, I'm gonna pose
with nothing but a python

04:23.137 --> 04:25.264
like Britney Spears.

04:27.058 --> 04:30.186
All I need
are a couple puppies

04:30.269 --> 04:32.563
to cover my puppies.

04:34.899 --> 04:37.235
I'm gonna balance
a champagne glass on my butt

04:37.318 --> 04:38.861
like Kim Kardashian.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.155
I tried it at home.

04:41.239 --> 04:44.367
There's even room
for the ice bucket.

04:46.119 --> 04:50.081
I'm thinking
of posing behind clothes.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.542
But then
you won't be naked.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.837
I guess I'm a little nervous
about being in the buff.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.339
Pardon my language.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.675
But you have
a gorgeous body.

05:00.758 --> 05:01.509
How do you know?

05:01.592 --> 05:05.388
I've never even
seen myself naked.

05:05.471 --> 05:09.559
I take out my contacts
before I undress.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.895
{\an3}I saw you when you went
through airport security.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.274
It was a nice outline.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.862
What if Reverend Bower
sees it?

05:20.945 --> 05:23.072
Ooh, Reverend Bower?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.574
Somebody's hot
for preacher.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.411
We're just friends.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.039
I wouldn't want him
to think less of me

05:31.122 --> 05:33.624
by seeing more of me.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.376
It's gonna be fine.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.086
Have another beer.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.048
{\an3}What we need
is to order some pizzas.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.884
{\an1}Elka, we've got
to watch our figures, honey.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.427
{\an1}We've got
a photo shoot coming.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.595
Relax.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.889
I'll just wear bigger puppies.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.103
You're a good friend,

05:54.187 --> 05:55.605
{\an1}volunteering to keep me company
at the DMV.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.440
I didn't volunteer.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.109
{\an3}You said we were going
for frozen yogurt.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.945
{\an1}Next.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.781
Oh, my goodness,
Victoria Chase!

06:04.864 --> 06:06.491
- I'm such a fan!
- Oh, thank you.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.576
You are not
gonna believe this,

06:08.659 --> 06:11.788
but my nitwit assistant here
lost my driver's license.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.122
{\an3}What?

06:13.206 --> 06:14.123
Oh, no problem.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.666
We have your photo on file.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.627
{\an1}It would be my honor
to reissue one immediately.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.670
Yeah,
I need to replace that photo

06:19.754 --> 06:21.255
with this one.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.841
{\an1}Oh, that's
a beautiful photo.

06:23.925 --> 06:24.967
{\an1}So pretty.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.595
I know.
So can you use it?

06:27.678 --> 06:29.305
Sorry, no can do.

06:29.388 --> 06:30.640
Why not?

06:30.723 --> 06:32.266
{\an1}The best we can do
is take your photo again,

06:32.350 --> 06:33.810
{\an1}but we have
to use our camera.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.353
- It's the law.
- Seriously?

06:35.436 --> 06:38.106
I have to have my photo
taken with that piece of--

06:38.189 --> 06:41.526
{\an3}Okay, I-I think what my boss
is trying to say is that

06:41.609 --> 06:43.152
it would be difficult

06:43.236 --> 06:45.196
{\an3}to take a nice photo of her
with your equipment.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.281
{\an1}Mm-hmm, perhaps
if you hadn't lost her license,

06:47.365 --> 06:49.367
{\an1}she wouldn't be
in this predicament.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.996
Okay.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.958
She's my mother's friend.
I had to hire her.

07:00.419 --> 07:01.838
I'm sorry, Miss Chase.

07:01.921 --> 07:02.964
I want to help you out,

07:03.047 --> 07:05.883
{\an1}but it's important that
everyone look like themselves.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.844
{\an3}This isn't
what I look like.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.805
This is what I look like.

07:10.888 --> 07:13.516
I'm sorry, no can do.

07:13.599 --> 07:16.519
{\an3}All right,
I will be back.

07:16.602 --> 07:17.645
{\an1}Hey, do you think
you could get Miss Chase

07:17.728 --> 07:18.813
to autograph this for me?

07:18.896 --> 07:21.899
I'm sorry, no can do.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.068
{\an1}It's assistants like you
that give stars

07:24.152 --> 07:26.904
{\an1}like Victoria Chase

07:29.323 --> 07:31.033
Okay, no more crying.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.702
Don't worry.
I've got this.

Ah, my grandmother's ring

07:39.041 --> 07:42.003
on my beautiful
fiancée's hand.

07:42.086 --> 07:43.713

Here I go again.

07:47.466 --> 07:48.384

{\an1}Oh, what's this
on my dress?

07:50.136 --> 07:52.638
{\an3}Oh.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.099
{\an3}Nose tears?

07:55.183 --> 07:56.559
I've got to go
clean this off.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.352
Pull yourself together.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.563
Okay. Ahh.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.567
{\an3}I cannot wait
to marry that woman.

08:04.650 --> 08:05.860
Yeah, I can see that.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.278
You two planning
on having kids?

08:07.361 --> 08:09.405
No, no.

08:09.488 --> 08:11.157
I mean, I've always dreamed
of having kids of my own,

08:11.240 --> 08:13.784
but when you get married
this late in life,

08:13.868 --> 08:16.370
it's not really in the cards,

08:16.454 --> 08:17.955
though I'd never say anything
to Joy about it.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.917
I wouldn't want her to think she
was disappointing me in any way.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.463
So Bob wants kids?

08:25.546 --> 08:27.590
{\an3}He says
he wants his own kids.

08:27.673 --> 08:28.758
{\an1}Have you discussed
having children?

08:28.841 --> 08:30.718
I didn't think
we had to discuss it.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.553
Now I'm worried
I'm being unfair.

08:32.636 --> 08:33.971
Bob's a man.

08:34.054 --> 08:36.432
He could still have kids
with someone younger.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.476
And less dried out.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.104
{\an3}[groans]

08:45.858 --> 08:47.652
{\an3}Is this
absolutely necessary?

08:47.735 --> 08:50.613
My photo shoot's tomorrow,

08:50.696 --> 08:53.491
and I need to practice
being comfortable.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.953
It's disturbing.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.663
It is a little awkward.

08:58.746 --> 09:01.457
Not for me.
Now, I'm an actress.

09:01.540 --> 09:04.126
I've been trained to convey
that the human body is beautiful

09:04.210 --> 09:05.878
no matter
what I'm actually feeling.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.966
{\an1}So what are you
gonna do?

09:10.049 --> 09:11.676
{\an3}The mature,
responsible thing--

09:11.759 --> 09:13.803
pretend I never heard him.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.972
Having kids
is a big issue.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.640
Ultimately, it's what broke up
me and Alec.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.976
I know, and I don't want
to go back to being

09:20.059 --> 09:22.812
sad, single, and alone.

09:22.895 --> 09:26.107
No offense, Melanie.

09:26.190 --> 09:29.318
I may be single,
but I'm not sad.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.320
{\an1}It's so easy
for us to get dates,

09:31.404 --> 09:34.323
{\an1}we've become reliant on guys
for our happiness,

09:34.407 --> 09:36.867
{\an1}which is why I am having a date
with myself tomorrow night

09:36.951 --> 09:38.828
at that new restaurant
I've been dying to try.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.913
And now
I'm using my acting training

09:40.997 --> 09:43.249
to pretend
that Melanie's plan isn't sad.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.838
You know what is sad
besides Melanie?

09:48.921 --> 09:50.881
I am not sad.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.509
Mamie Sue thinks
her body isn't good enough

09:53.592 --> 09:54.677

{\an1}Well,
maybe she's just shy,

09:56.762 --> 10:01.350
and maybe
you should be shy too.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.729
Hey, we're not gonna
look this hot forever.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.151
Mm-hmm. Next.

10:10.234 --> 10:14.030
{\an1}Oh, Victoria Chase, are you back
to take your picture?

10:14.113 --> 10:16.324
{\an3}Yes, I am, and I'm
going to use your equipment

10:16.407 --> 10:18.409
as required by law.

10:18.492 --> 10:20.202
{\an1}Wonderful,
just step over there.

10:22.371 --> 10:23.205
Okay, are you ready?

10:23.289 --> 10:26.709
Ready.

10:30.629 --> 10:33.466
Oh, wow,
that was amazing.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.553
So did you
get the shot?

10:37.636 --> 10:39.096
Oh, whoopsie.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.139
Whoopsie?

10:42.308 --> 10:43.309
{\an1}I got it.
Next.

10:48.272 --> 10:49.190
What kind of music
should we listen to

10:49.273 --> 10:50.107
for the photo session?

10:50.191 --> 10:53.944
Well, it's hard
to keep your clothes on

10:54.028 --> 10:56.405
when you're listening
to Sinatra.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.491
True story.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.411
{\an3}I'm still feeling nervous
about this.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.039
Why? What's the worst
that can happen?

11:05.122 --> 11:08.793
{\an3}Well, hello,
Mamie Sue, ladies.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.252
Hello, Reverend Bower.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.963
It might look like
we were talking about something,

11:13.047 --> 11:14.799
but we weren't.

11:14.882 --> 11:17.927
Okay, I hope to see you
in the front pew

11:18.010 --> 11:18.928
in church again this Sunday.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.596
Oh, you will.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.264
What's your sermon
going to be about?

11:22.348 --> 11:24.392
Society's declining values.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.480
Ladies, Mamie Sue.

11:29.563 --> 11:30.940
Good-bye.

11:31.023 --> 11:34.110
I hardly know these women.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.279
She's hot for preacher.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.447
You said that already.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.199
I'm a nude model.

11:40.282 --> 11:43.119
I don't have to be smart.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.579
Well, I'm not going
to be a nude model.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.623
Because of Reverend Bower?

11:47.706 --> 11:48.833
It's not just him.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.794
{\an1}Who wants to see me
like that anyway?

11:51.877 --> 11:53.295
Maybe 40 years ago.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.506
But why should we think
we're only beautiful

11:55.589 --> 11:57.383
up to a certain age?

11:57.466 --> 12:01.554
Girl, my varicose veins
look like a fault map.

12:01.637 --> 12:04.807
And my muffin tops
have muffin tops.

12:04.890 --> 12:08.811
And my ass
looks like a bag of socks.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.982
But are we gonna let
all that get in the way

12:13.065 --> 12:14.692
of our getting naked
in front of the world?

12:14.775 --> 12:17.111
Oh, hell, yeah.

12:17.194 --> 12:19.613
I'm with them.
I'm out too.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.324
Oh, come on, girls, what can
I do to change your mind?

12:22.408 --> 12:26.787
Turn the calendar back
to 1965.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.629
Wow, these tables
are so close.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.047
[laughs]

12:37.131 --> 12:39.008
{\an1}But don't worry.
I won't be eavesdropping.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.342
{\an1}Why would I?
I have a book.

12:40.426 --> 12:41.594
{\an1}[laughs]

12:45.598 --> 12:47.391
Can I get you a drink,
or should we wait for your date?

12:47.475 --> 12:50.895
Uh, yes, you can get me
a glass of Merlot,

12:50.978 --> 12:52.480
and my date is already here.

12:55.107 --> 12:58.903
And what can I get for you?

12:58.986 --> 13:00.905
{\an3}I know that
there's nobody sitting there.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.239
I'm not crazy.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.825
I am just a lady
on a date with herself,

13:04.909 --> 13:07.870
celebrating being alone.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.914
Oh, God, is that cat hair?

13:11.457 --> 13:12.875
{\an3}Okay, don't look at me
like that.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.877
I'm sure there are plenty
of people that come here

13:14.960 --> 13:15.836
and dine by themselves.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.630
Not really.

13:17.713 --> 13:20.382
{\an1}Uh, we were voted Cleveland's
most romantic restaurant.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.676
Oh, well,
then it's the perfect atmosphere

13:22.760 --> 13:25.888
for me to read
my World War II love story.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.181
Just bring me the chateaubriand.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.891
It's for two.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.143
We'll see about that.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.736
{\an1}Oh, my God, Melanie Moretti
from the radio show.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.404
Yes, yes, that's me.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.572
I saw your picture
at the dry cleaner.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.949
Oh.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.408
{\an1}I'm so sorry
to bother you.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.118
{\an3}No, no, no,
it's no bother at all.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.453
What would you like
to talk about?

13:49.537 --> 13:50.538
Is there anything
you'd like to talk about?

13:50.621 --> 13:52.957
Please sit down.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.625
{\an1}I just wanted to say
thank you,

13:54.708 --> 13:56.377
{\an1}because you said
on your radio show,

13:56.460 --> 13:57.920
"Fear of being alone

13:58.003 --> 14:00.089
{\an1}is no reason to stay
in a bad relationship,"

14:00.172 --> 14:01.924
{\an1}so I dumped
my terrible boyfriend,

14:02.007 --> 14:04.134
{\an1}and now I just go out by myself
if I want to.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.594
And it's fun, right?

14:05.678 --> 14:07.388
So fun.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.099
{\an1}I mean,
the first time I did it,

14:10.182 --> 14:12.101
{\an1}I was so self-conscious,
I ate a whole bread basket.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.894
Oh, I just ordered
3 pounds of meat.

14:13.978 --> 14:17.231
{\an1}Oh. [laughs]
Okay.

14:17.314 --> 14:18.899
But this is nice too.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.609
Ah, so nice.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.735
Yeah.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.117
Want to go someplace
and pick up guys?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.868
- Oh, God, yes.
- Okay.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.748
{\an3}Joy, I was up all night
practicing.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.792
{\an3}How's this?

14:36.875 --> 14:39.795
{\an1}Oh, Bob,
that's a beautiful smile.

14:39.878 --> 14:41.755
- You look so handsome.
- Thanks.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.465
I was looking in the mirror,

14:43.549 --> 14:46.135
thinking about what I love most
about you, and I saw this smile,

14:46.218 --> 14:47.845
{\an3}and I thought,
"That looks good.

14:47.928 --> 14:50.639
That looks damn good."

14:50.723 --> 14:52.474
{\an3}You know,
you're a lucky woman, Joy.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.642
- I am.
- Mmm.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.686
{\an1}Mmm.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.980
{\an1}So what do you love most
about me?

14:58.063 --> 15:01.275
I love that we're a team.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.985
{\an3}We may disagree
about the little things,

15:03.068 --> 15:04.653
{\an3}but we agree
on the big things,

15:04.737 --> 15:06.280
and that's what matters most.

15:06.363 --> 15:11.160
{\an1}Yes, it's important
to agree on the big things

15:11.243 --> 15:13.495
{\an1}and be open and honest
with each other

15:13.579 --> 15:15.122
about the big things.

15:15.205 --> 15:18.459
{\an3}All right,
you two lovebirds, smile.

15:21.545 --> 15:25.382
{\an1}Bob, what if
there were one big thing that,

15:25.466 --> 15:28.719
{\an1}if revealed,
could potentially destroy us?

15:28.802 --> 15:31.013
Would you still love me?

15:31.096 --> 15:33.349
{\an3}I guess,

15:33.432 --> 15:37.519
{\an3}although I feel my smile
starting to fade a little.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.188
{\an1}Oh, it's nothing
we should talk about now

15:39.271 --> 15:40.522
or ever, really.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.150
{\an3}Ah.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.027
How big, Joy?

15:45.110 --> 15:47.363
How big is the big thing?

15:47.446 --> 15:49.657
{\an1}It's big.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.242
{\an3}Joy, I think I need to know
what the big thing is.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.369
{\an1}All right.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.995
{\an1}Wait.

15:55.079 --> 15:55.954
I heard you talking

15:56.038 --> 15:58.123
{\an1}about how you'd always dreamed
of having kids,

15:58.207 --> 16:00.876
and I felt terrible.

16:00.959 --> 16:03.879
{\an1}You should be marrying someone
you can have children with.

16:03.962 --> 16:07.549
{\an3}Joy, you're the woman
I want to marry.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.218
{\an3}If you don't want to have kids,
that's fine.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.886
{\an1}But I do.
I would love to.

16:10.969 --> 16:14.556
{\an1}I'm just too...
not young enough.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.141
{\an3}But what difference
does age make?

16:16.225 --> 16:17.559
We can adopt.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.603
{\an1}But I thought
you wanted your own child.

16:19.687 --> 16:23.857
{\an3}If we adopt a child,
it will be my own--our own.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.402
{\an1}Oh, Bob.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.737
{\an1}I would love
to adopt a child with you.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.073
And I with you.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.908
[both crying]

16:36.495 --> 16:38.539
Do you guys want to,
like, reschedule or--

16:38.622 --> 16:41.875
{\an1}No, no, no, no, no,
take the photo.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.420
{\an1}I want to capture exactly
how we're feeling right now,

16:44.503 --> 16:46.338
in this moment.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.341
[both crying]

16:53.512 --> 16:54.972
{\an3}How's this?

16:55.055 --> 16:56.473
Same time tomorrow?

17:01.687 --> 17:02.604
{\an1}Do you want me
to turn up the heat?

17:02.688 --> 17:07.568
{\an3}No, keep it down
for perkiness.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.319
So, uh, you're the only model
for this calendar?

17:10.404 --> 17:14.491
{\an3}Nope, Miss December
is in the house, child.

17:16.034 --> 17:17.286
Marcia.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.454
I thought
about what you said

17:19.538 --> 17:22.040
about women our age
being invisible,

17:22.124 --> 17:25.085
and I don't want
to be invisible.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.837
Neither do I.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.131
I got a full-body wax.

17:29.214 --> 17:32.301
I'm hairless from my eyebrows
to my ankles.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.096
{\an3}Helen,
what changed your mind?

17:36.180 --> 17:38.599
Your inspiring words
and two vodkas.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.936
Poor Mamie Sue.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.105
{\an3}She'll never know
how freeing this is.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.483
Yes, she will.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.984
{\an3}Mamie Sue!

17:49.067 --> 17:50.694
You were right, Elka.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.946
We ought to be doing this.

17:53.030 --> 17:56.241
A girl should feel
she's beautiful her whole life,

17:56.325 --> 17:59.286
not just the years
she's actually beautiful.

18:01.079 --> 18:02.498
Get over here.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.750
- Let's make a calendar.
- I'm ready.

18:11.089 --> 18:14.843
I forgot my wallet.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.637
But I don't need it.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.478
{\an3}[gasps] How'd it go
at the adoption agency?

18:24.561 --> 18:26.730
{\an1}Looks good,
but it's gonna be a process.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.066
Oh,
I'm all for you two adopting,

18:29.149 --> 18:31.360
and FYI,
with your light skin,

18:31.443 --> 18:34.363
a darker baby
would really pop.

18:34.446 --> 18:35.989
We should open
some champagne.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.658
To celebrate the baby?

18:37.741 --> 18:41.245
That and the blessed arrival
of my new driver's license.

18:41.328 --> 18:42.996
Take a look, ladies.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.706
Oh, honey,
that's a terrible picture.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.251
Yeah, I know,
but look at the birth date.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.919
1980?

18:50.629 --> 18:52.381
So they made a mistake.

18:52.464 --> 18:56.552
Uh-uh, according to the great
state of Ohio, I'm 35,

18:56.635 --> 18:58.303
and we're all gonna
go with that.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.516
{\an1}The calendars are out,
girls.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.353
Oh, look at Miss September.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.897
She's 98?

19:08.981 --> 19:11.358
Oh, and look
at that cute, wrinkly Shar-Pei

19:11.441 --> 19:13.569
she's holding in her lap.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.530
She didn't pose with a dog.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.959
{\an3}Is this unbelievable
or what?

19:29.042 --> 19:32.087
{\an1}Well, this has been great
for my marriage.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.715
{\an1}My husband is looking at me
differently.

19:34.798 --> 19:36.425
He's looking at me.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.972
I heard the senior center alone
bought 50 copies.

19:42.055 --> 19:44.099
We've caused two heart attacks
already!

19:46.351 --> 19:48.395
{\an3}Mamie Sue.

19:48.478 --> 19:51.273
{\an1}Reverend Bower,
I can't believe you're here.

19:51.356 --> 19:55.402
{\an3}I am so proud that you
have taken what God gave you

19:55.485 --> 19:56.820
{\an3}and put it
toward a good cause.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.114
{\an1}Really?
Thank you.

19:59.197 --> 20:01.116
And even though it's April,

20:01.199 --> 20:03.535
{\an3}my calendar
still shows January.

20:05.245 --> 20:07.623
That's my month.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.458
You know, Mamie,

20:09.541 --> 20:11.460
{\an3}there's a raffle night
coming up at the church--

20:11.543 --> 20:14.463
{\an1}And you'd like me
to pose nude for the poster?

20:14.546 --> 20:16.465
{\an1}Sure!

20:16.548 --> 20:20.093
{\an3}Actually, I was just hoping
you'd be my date.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.929
I would love that.
