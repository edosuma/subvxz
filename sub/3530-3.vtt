00:00.661 --> 00:01.995
<i>Previously on The Tudors...</i>

00:01.995 --> 00:03.663
Lady Anne of Cleves.

00:03.663 --> 00:05.783
Welcome to my court.

00:06.415 --> 00:09.671
Why did Your Majesty invite
Lady Anne of Cleves for Christmas?

00:10.641 --> 00:12.848
I like her after all.

00:13.206 --> 00:15.043
He ought not to have
divorced the Lady Anne.

00:15.043 --> 00:17.297
I fear that you will
have to reconcile yourself

00:17.297 --> 00:18.305
to the new Queen.

00:18.305 --> 00:20.846
No, I will not. I hate her.

00:21.263 --> 00:23.382
Tell me, my Lord Surrey,
what are your ambitions?

00:23.483 --> 00:26.798
To surpass the achievements
of my father and my grandfather.

00:26.798 --> 00:29.182
The Earl has made it
plain that he despises us.

00:29.182 --> 00:31.995
Says you tried to entrap him
but he is too noble a beast

00:31.995 --> 00:34.186
to be tangled by
such cunning hooks.

00:34.287 --> 00:35.788
I have come here to ask you

00:35.822 --> 00:37.789
why you will not show
me the respect which,

00:37.789 --> 00:41.178
as Queen of England,
I'm entitled to expect even from you.

00:41.178 --> 00:45.014
You are thought capable of
bearing sons. Unfortunately,

00:45.014 --> 00:47.611
I see you are still not pregnant.

00:47.768 --> 00:50.255
She is very appealing.

00:50.255 --> 00:51.937
Do you really want to?

00:51.972 --> 00:54.071
I can arrange it.

00:54.071 --> 00:55.733
The ulcer on His Majesty's leg

00:55.733 --> 00:57.110
has unfortunately
become clogged again.

00:57.110 --> 01:00.112
I fear for His Majesty's life.

01:01.481 --> 01:03.416
His Majesty remains indisposed.

01:03.450 --> 01:05.078
Why will he not see me?

01:05.078 --> 01:06.900
Has he taken a mistress,
Master Culpepper?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.835
I cannot answer Your Majesty.
I'm sorry.

01:08.835 --> 01:10.807
You may go since you
will not tell me anything.

01:10.807 --> 01:12.258
You know I would do
anything in the world

01:12.359 --> 01:14.627
to bring you comfort
and make you happy.

01:15.929 --> 01:18.055
He wants to visit you privately.

01:18.055 --> 01:19.299
That's not possible.

01:19.299 --> 01:21.967
Nobody else need ever know.
Not the King,

01:21.967 --> 01:24.851
not anybody.

One two three... One two three...

03:48.900 --> 03:49.972
One two three...

03:52.715 --> 03:55.263
One two three...
One two three... Turn...

03:56.750 --> 03:58.919
Lord, turn!

04:00.099 --> 04:02.267
My Lady! This way! No,
no, no, no, no, no.

04:02.402 --> 04:04.983
I will show you.

04:14.372 --> 04:18.522
<i>Comme รงa! You see?</i>

04:20.591 --> 04:23.190
Elegant;

04:23.991 --> 04:26.858
everything is elegant.

04:29.855 --> 04:32.031
Beautiful!

04:32.534 --> 04:36.546
Everything that is not
elegant must be beautiful.

04:40.232 --> 04:42.711
Your Majesty.

04:46.488 --> 04:49.886
I haven't seen you for
a good while. I'm sorry.

04:49.886 --> 04:52.470
I did not know
the reason for it.

04:52.470 --> 04:53.767
No one told me.

04:53.767 --> 04:55.062
I was unwell.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.159
But now I am better.

04:57.159 --> 04:59.334
Thank God.

05:00.264 --> 05:02.218
I trust you found something
to amuse yourself

05:02.218 --> 05:04.775
while I was away?

05:08.640 --> 05:10.710
I missed Your Majesty so much.

05:10.710 --> 05:13.195
I hope they gave you my gifts.

05:13.195 --> 05:15.820
Your gifts are not you.

05:18.027 --> 05:19.451
My Lord Surrey.

05:19.451 --> 05:22.342
Majesty.

05:23.847 --> 05:26.042
You are a blood
relative of my wife.

05:26.898 --> 05:29.706
For that reason,and because you so
distinguished yourself in France,

05:29.706 --> 05:32.907
I've decided to make you a Knight
of the Order of the Garter.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.451
Does it please you?

05:37.648 --> 05:40.839
I am deeply grateful,
Your Majesty.

05:41.446 --> 05:42.726
My Lord Surrey. -

05:42.726 --> 05:45.100
Majesty.

05:53.169 --> 05:56.486
Ah, I have something for you.

06:11.087 --> 06:14.917
Thank you. It's beautiful.

06:15.206 --> 06:17.612
So are you.

06:26.836 --> 06:29.455
I am going away tomorrow,
for a few days.

06:29.455 --> 06:31.814
But tonight I will visit
to your bedchamber.

06:32.144 --> 06:33.611
For nothing would please me more

06:33.611 --> 06:36.847
than for you to conceive my child.

07:04.518 --> 07:06.123
Your Majesty, good morning.

07:06.123 --> 07:07.334
My Lord Bishop.

07:07.334 --> 07:09.580
Your Majesty, these poor,
suffering subjects,

07:09.580 --> 07:11.115
they have begged leave to receive

07:11.115 --> 07:15.141
Your Majesty's gift of grace.

07:18.812 --> 07:22.682
So if Your Majesty might consent
to lay your hands upon them?

07:28.032 --> 07:31.735
Your Majesty. Please.
Please. Your Majesty.

07:33.690 --> 07:38.064
By the Grace of God,
I command you to be healed.

07:44.557 --> 07:46.462
By the Grace of God,

07:46.462 --> 07:49.733
I command you to be healed.

07:56.638 --> 07:57.874
Please, Your Majesty.

07:57.874 --> 08:01.220
By the Grace of God,
I command you to be healed.

08:01.322 --> 08:04.924
Please, Your Majesty. Please.

08:06.872 --> 08:11.397
By the Grace of God,
I command you to be healed.

08:11.397 --> 08:15.119
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

08:34.518 --> 08:36.839
By the Grace of God,

08:36.839 --> 08:39.318
I command you to be healed.

08:39.318 --> 08:45.389
God bless you, Your Majesty.
Thank you, Your Majesty.

08:46.774 --> 08:48.801
Oh, thank you.

08:53.741 --> 08:57.266
Thank you, Your Majesty.

08:57.266 --> 08:58.824
Thank you, Your Majesty.

08:58.824 --> 09:03.284
Oh, thank you, Your Majesty.
Thank you, Your Majesty.

09:03.284 --> 09:06.505
Oh, thank you, Your Majesty.
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.499
Thank you, Your Majesty!

09:17.631 --> 09:21.167
God bless you, Your Majesty!

09:35.524 --> 09:40.000
Hever Castle Residence
of Anne of Cleves

10:11.715 --> 10:15.214
Bravo, my Lady. Bravo!

10:18.439 --> 10:21.583
- Your Majesty.
- Majesty.

10:26.306 --> 10:28.653
Your Majesty.

10:28.653 --> 10:30.401
Did I surprise you?

10:31.450 --> 10:32.957
Good.

10:38.997 --> 10:42.382
Lady Elizabeth. - Your Grace.

10:43.068 --> 10:45.573
I have a gift for you.

10:45.573 --> 10:47.011
How is your Latin?

10:47.011 --> 10:50.491
I enjoy learning it,
thank you, Your Majesty.

10:51.209 --> 10:53.783
Mr Grindle, the tutor you gave me,

10:53.783 --> 10:56.188
is an excellent teacher.

10:57.669 --> 11:02.663
This book is by the
Roman historian Tacitus.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.739
Now you may find it
difficult to read

11:04.739 --> 11:07.627
but the effort
will be worthwhile.

11:07.627 --> 11:12.394
For without knowledge,
life is not worth having.

11:13.582 --> 11:16.654
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.

11:19.684 --> 11:24.238
I am very grateful and thank God
every night for your good health

11:24.238 --> 11:27.730
and trust you will be our
good King, and father,

11:27.730 --> 11:29.922
a long time.

11:32.935 --> 11:34.964
Madam.

11:34.964 --> 11:36.238
I have come for supper.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.266
I hope that doesn't
inconvenience you.

11:38.301 --> 11:41.951
I think we may find something
in the larder, Your Majesty.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.382
Good.

11:43.743 --> 11:45.820
Your formal installation
into the Order

11:45.820 --> 11:47.688
will take place soon,
my Lord Surrey.

11:47.688 --> 11:50.964
The King's grace has commanded
me to prepare you for the event,

11:50.964 --> 11:53.431
which I am happy
and willing to do.

11:53.431 --> 11:56.578
I am sure your lordship is
aware of the great significance

11:56.578 --> 12:00.602
attached to the Order by His
Majesty and the great honor

12:00.602 --> 12:04.561
that he conveys upon you
by electing you to it.

12:04.561 --> 12:08.704
As you know, the Order
comprises of twenty-five

12:08.704 --> 12:11.597
noble and valiant knights
and their sovereign.

12:11.597 --> 12:14.541
There is no greater
honor in England.

12:14.966 --> 12:19.062
Your lordship has no need
to sell the Order to me.

12:20.627 --> 12:22.873
How long have you
belonged to the Order?

12:23.475 --> 12:25.181
I was elected earlier this year.

12:25.181 --> 12:27.639
A few months, oh.

12:28.985 --> 12:31.785
My father and four
generations of my family

12:31.785 --> 12:34.322
have already belonged to it.

12:36.938 --> 12:39.130
Shall we eat?

12:50.039 --> 12:53.151
Where do you suppose
the King has gone?

12:53.151 --> 12:55.608
I don't know, Your Majesty.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.363
They tell me there's
a full moon tomorrow

13:03.363 --> 13:06.235
and we shall all
behave like lunatics.

13:06.235 --> 13:10.668
For some, the moon
is the planet of love.

13:17.790 --> 13:19.974
I want to see him again.

13:25.470 --> 13:27.164
As you wish.

13:30.636 --> 13:34.559
Perhaps I could bring
him to my room.

13:35.131 --> 13:38.942
Then I could wait outside,
in case anyone should come.

13:42.430 --> 13:46.730
I only urge Your Majesty
to be careful when you--

13:46.730 --> 13:50.144
What, Lady Rochford?

13:50.144 --> 13:51.913
Don't you think I know
how to meddle with a man

13:51.913 --> 13:55.281
without conceiving a child?

14:14.651 --> 14:16.923
Your Majesty should be
proud of your daughters.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.154
Both of them.

14:18.154 --> 14:20.515
They do you a great credit.

14:20.515 --> 14:27.345
The Lady Mary is very serious
and religious but very clever

14:27.345 --> 14:31.082
like some women,
she likes to hide her intelligence.

14:31.082 --> 14:35.585
But the Lady Elizabeth - she
cannot hide her intelligence.

14:35.585 --> 14:39.398
She will be a great lady,
I think...

14:39.398 --> 14:42.256
if God so wills it.

14:42.585 --> 14:45.015
Your Majesty.

14:47.590 --> 14:51.712
I have something which I should
like to return to Your Majesty.

14:55.206 --> 14:57.335
My wedding ring.

14:58.095 --> 15:01.688
I should like you to
break it into pieces,

15:01.688 --> 15:04.074
as a thing of no value.

15:24.276 --> 15:27.566
: Katherine? Sweetheart?

15:27.566 --> 15:30.708
Yes, Thomas.

15:31.214 --> 15:34.122
Do you like our
meeting like this?

15:34.704 --> 15:36.567
Yes.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.781
Do you love me yet?

15:41.458 --> 15:46.274
Let me perceive by some
token that you love me.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.231
: Shall I kiss you?

15:49.231 --> 15:53.549
We have kissed before,
Katherine sweet.

15:58.642 --> 16:00.736
It does not mean that you love me.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.938
: What else can I show you?

16:33.447 --> 16:35.478
My Lord Surrey,

16:36.184 --> 16:39.968
I am commanded now to
invest you with the Garter,

16:40.002 --> 16:43.304
for you to wear at
your installation.

16:46.919 --> 16:53.230
"Honni soit qui mal y pense.
" Evil be to him who evil thinks.

17:05.012 --> 17:06.623
Sir.

17:08.045 --> 17:11.198
The most friendly
Companions of this Order,

17:11.198 --> 17:13.479
denominated from the Garter,

17:13.479 --> 17:17.740
have admitted you, their friend,
brother, and companion,

17:17.740 --> 17:21.103
in faithful testimony of which
they impart and give you

17:21.103 --> 17:26.367
the Garter, which God grant that you,
deservedly receiving it,

17:26.367 --> 17:30.673
may rightly wear and use
to the Glory of God.

17:32.698 --> 17:35.451
Thank you, my friends,

17:36.025 --> 17:38.101
brothers,

17:38.101 --> 17:41.378
and companions.

17:43.777 --> 17:45.646
Your Grace.

17:59.268 --> 18:01.092
You know I am
very grateful to you

18:01.092 --> 18:04.719
for raising no objection to
the annulment of our marriage.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.983
It runs rather counter to
my experience of women.

18:08.983 --> 18:12.502
Your Majesty, I can truly say

18:12.502 --> 18:16.549
that I wish in all things
to please you as my Lord,

18:16.549 --> 18:19.308
to bear testament to your
good treatment of me,

18:19.308 --> 18:23.778
and to stay in this country
that I already love as my own.

18:28.251 --> 18:30.796
Do you know what the French
Ambassador wrote about you?

18:32.099 --> 18:35.482
We intercepted his letter.

18:36.051 --> 18:39.687
He said that our people
much regretted our divorce,

18:40.284 --> 18:42.958
and that in a short time
you had won their love,

18:43.523 --> 18:48.115
and that they esteemed you
as one of the most sweet,

18:48.115 --> 18:52.642
gracious, and humane
queens they had ever had.

18:59.262 --> 19:02.003
You have another queen now.

19:02.003 --> 19:03.858
Yes.

19:04.874 --> 19:06.706
I like her.

19:07.674 --> 19:10.731
She is beautiful, of course.

19:10.731 --> 19:15.947
And very young. Full of life.
You must adore her.

19:33.746 --> 19:36.281
My Lady!

19:38.974 --> 19:40.542
My Lady!

19:41.683 --> 19:43.676
My Lady...

20:05.394 --> 20:07.721
You did your duty.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.898
He's insufferable.

20:09.898 --> 20:12.500
He thinks us all his inferiors.

20:12.500 --> 20:15.070
Unfortunately,
we did him the great favor

20:15.070 --> 20:17.319
of making a member of
his family the Queen.

20:17.319 --> 20:21.775
- What is made can sometimes be unmade
- like a bed.

20:21.843 --> 20:24.978
What chance is there?
The King is besotted by her.

20:25.113 --> 20:27.614
Everyone knows that.
That may change.

20:27.682 --> 20:30.651
She seems to me nothing but
a frivolous and stupid girl.

20:31.226 --> 20:34.113
In any case,

20:34.113 --> 20:37.417
I want you to teach the
Earl a lesson in humility.

20:37.418 --> 20:41.167
I will be called a she-wolf

20:41.167 --> 20:44.273
by no man, nor should you allow

20:44.273 --> 20:48.050
the slanders against our
family to go unpunished.

20:48.207 --> 20:52.849
Surely, my dear husband,

20:52.849 --> 20:56.882
you could arrange for some
misfortune to befall him?

22:01.080 --> 22:02.981
Hello, my friends!

22:03.082 --> 22:05.350
Jesus Christ!

22:05.350 --> 22:07.003
Not quite!

22:07.003 --> 22:10.275
As you see, I have been
received into the most noble,

22:10.275 --> 22:13.580
most prestigious
Order of the Garter.

22:13.580 --> 22:20.242
And here indeed is the garter!
"Honni soit qui mal y pense."

22:20.242 --> 22:24.320
Evil to him who evil thinks!

22:24.320 --> 22:28.178
It's a good motto.
I agree with it.

22:28.178 --> 22:30.716
Ale, please!

22:30.716 --> 22:32.538
My responsibilities to the Order

22:32.538 --> 22:34.393
have already made me
dreadfully thirsty.

22:34.393 --> 22:37.196
- Very fine, my Lord!
- Thank you.

22:37.196 --> 22:40.598
How in God's name did you
afford all this, my Lord?

22:40.699 --> 22:45.570
I have often had no money,
but I have never been poor.

22:45.570 --> 22:47.875
Wench! How would you like
to suck the cock of a man

22:47.875 --> 22:50.541
who's a member of the
Order of the Garter?

22:50.576 --> 22:52.710
What would your friends say?

22:52.778 --> 22:56.547
They would tell me not to
swallow stories like that.

22:59.251 --> 23:01.158
Your hand!

23:03.359 --> 23:04.890
It is...

23:04.890 --> 23:09.878
all naked. - Ooh.

23:12.567 --> 23:18.440
There, there, there.
It is dressed.

23:20.239 --> 23:21.906
Thank you, ma'am.

23:21.974 --> 23:24.008
Come here.

23:25.044 --> 23:30.114
More ale. Drink up,
my friend. Drink up.

23:31.025 --> 23:34.660
My Lords,
we must before long agree

23:34.660 --> 23:37.769
on these plans for our much-
delayed progress to the North.

23:38.814 --> 23:42.196
We shall take a large retinue,
including men-at-arms,

23:42.196 --> 23:43.831
since we mean especially
to visit those parts

23:43.831 --> 23:46.453
of our realm which, not long ago,

23:49.648 --> 23:51.493
However, this time
we expect the people,

23:51.493 --> 23:54.737
being pardoned by our grace,
to make further submissions

23:54.737 --> 23:56.886
in acknowledgments of
their past depravities.

23:58.261 --> 23:59.684
My Lady.

24:00.093 --> 24:04.128
It is also our intention to
invite James, King of Scots,

24:04.128 --> 24:06.497
to meet with us at
York in September.

24:08.829 --> 24:10.162
Your Majesty.

24:10.842 --> 24:13.295
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

24:13.295 --> 24:14.807
The King's in Council!

24:14.807 --> 24:16.595
Arrange for the conveyance of
our best tapestries and plates.

24:16.595 --> 24:18.853
Yes, Your Majesty...

24:21.164 --> 24:23.154
I apologize, Your Majesty.

24:25.261 --> 24:27.013
Come.

24:30.576 --> 24:33.718
Katherine, you silly-
- I have missed my bleeding.

24:33.718 --> 24:36.343
I believe I am with child.

24:40.585 --> 24:43.153
My sweet sweetheart...

24:45.509 --> 24:49.099
I had to tell Your Majesty.
I am sorry I made you angry.

24:49.099 --> 24:52.111
I'm not angry. How could I
be any bit angry? God forbid.

24:52.111 --> 24:56.931
Katherine, listen to me,
listen to me. Listen to me.

24:56.931 --> 24:59.914
For the sake of our child,
please, girl,

24:59.914 --> 25:03.865
don't excite yourself.
Go and lay down.

25:03.865 --> 25:07.834
Rest, and I will come and
see you very, very soon.

25:10.226 --> 25:12.353
God bless you.

25:14.061 --> 25:15.870
Go.

25:30.468 --> 25:34.536
My beautiful young Queen. Go.

25:53.025 --> 25:54.626
How is my father?

25:54.626 --> 25:57.524
The King, having recovered
from his recent illness,

25:57.524 --> 26:00.445
seems in much better humor,
my Lady.

26:02.042 --> 26:03.406
He is planning to make a progress

26:03.406 --> 26:05.404
to the North of England.

26:06.004 --> 26:08.869
A great deal of work
is already instigated.

26:11.107 --> 26:13.874
They say that embroiderers
are working on furniture

26:13.874 --> 26:16.761
and tapestries using
copes and ornaments

26:16.761 --> 26:19.144
stripped from the churches, alas.

26:20.116 --> 26:22.075
Excellency.

26:22.804 --> 26:25.156
Thank you, Madam.

26:42.488 --> 26:46.803
There is another reason why
the King's humor is improved.

26:47.833 --> 26:52.156
There are rumors. The Queen
is thought to be with child.

26:56.436 --> 26:58.609
I'm sure His Majesty
would be overjoyed

26:58.609 --> 27:00.648
if she produced a Duke of York.

27:00.648 --> 27:02.768
On the other hand,

27:02.768 --> 27:06.520
if she does not,
then the succession may,

27:06.520 --> 27:09.208
in fact, remain an open question.

27:09.208 --> 27:11.225
What do you mean?

27:11.225 --> 27:15.032
Surely Edward is first in line?
Who could doubt it?

27:15.032 --> 27:17.106
Lady Mary,

27:17.106 --> 27:21.041
certain important people
at court have told me

27:21.041 --> 27:23.439
they feel a "Scruple"
Of conscience

27:23.439 --> 27:25.688
over the fact that
Prince Edward's mother,

27:25.688 --> 27:29.506
Queen Jane, was never
ever formally crowned,

27:29.506 --> 27:32.306
unlike your own mother,
Queen Catherine.

27:32.306 --> 27:34.882
So the rumor also goes,
that the King intends to crown

27:34.882 --> 27:37.697
his new Queen at York,
so if she has a son

27:37.697 --> 27:42.800
no one can question his
legitimacy or right to the throne.

27:44.300 --> 27:47.172
But if she does
not have a son...

27:47.172 --> 27:52.404
Exactly. It would strengthen
your own claim to the crown.

27:56.458 --> 27:58.700
Which is why these certain
people at court have assured me

27:58.700 --> 28:02.551
how they pray, pray,
not only for the overthrow

28:02.551 --> 28:06.518
of vile reformers like Hertford,
but for the day and the hour

28:06.518 --> 28:10.023
that Your Grace
succeeds to the throne.

28:11.271 --> 28:13.901
Only if God wills it,
Excellency.

28:14.097 --> 28:15.876
Only if God wills it.

28:15.876 --> 28:18.309
But He must will it, Lady Mary.

28:18.309 --> 28:21.536
For how else will this untry
ever be restored to obedience

28:21.536 --> 28:25.999
and to faith? Otherwise,
as things are,

28:26.275 --> 28:29.050
it will go to the devil.

28:36.144 --> 28:38.622
Tell me more about the progress.

28:38.657 --> 28:40.454
Where shall we go?

28:40.454 --> 28:42.400
First to Hatfield,

28:42.400 --> 28:46.295
then to Dunstable,
Ampthill, and Grafton,

28:46.295 --> 28:48.432
hunting and hawking along the way.

28:48.432 --> 28:53.283
Then to Stamford,
and then Lincoln,

28:53.283 --> 28:56.658
and so on to Boston and Yorkshire.

28:56.658 --> 28:58.844
And you'll have to have
plenty of new dresses made,

28:58.844 --> 29:01.617
for there will be many great
occasions and banquets along the way,

29:01.617 --> 29:05.981
and great crowds will come
to see your magnificence.

29:06.084 --> 29:09.312
I'm so excited.
All of this seems to me

29:09.312 --> 29:12.424
still like a dream,
from which I hope never to wake!

29:14.889 --> 29:17.271
Will you come to my
bedchamber tonight?

29:17.271 --> 29:20.565
No, sweetheart.
It's too dangerous

29:21.311 --> 29:23.795
not while you're with child.

29:27.738 --> 29:32.376
What's the matter?
You are with child?

29:36.000 --> 29:37.912
I was mistaken.

29:37.912 --> 29:41.752
I-- I miss--

29:51.180 --> 29:53.014
My Lady?

29:55.646 --> 29:57.326
My Lady?

30:10.832 --> 30:13.834
: Master Culpepper,

30:15.267 --> 30:21.522
I heartily recommend
me unto you...

30:21.522 --> 30:25.898
Praying you send me
word how that you do.

30:26.993 --> 30:31.481
I would you were with
me now that you might

30:31.481 --> 30:35.730
see what pain I take
in writing to you.

30:35.730 --> 30:39.205
"I heard that you were sick.
And never longed so much

30:39.205 --> 30:43.042
"For anything as to see you.
It makes my heart die

30:43.042 --> 30:46.678
to think I can't always
be in your company."

30:46.712 --> 30:50.570
It makes my heart die

30:50.570 --> 30:55.954
to think I cannot always
be in your company. Yours--

30:56.055 --> 31:00.592
- Yours as long as life endures
- Katherine.

31:00.726 --> 31:04.762
It's not her fault.
She's so young.

31:13.656 --> 31:17.142
No. That is her fault.

32:48.646 --> 32:50.236
You play well.

32:50.236 --> 32:52.886
You didn't used to, I remember.

32:53.305 --> 32:57.008
And I never used to drink wine,
or play music.

32:57.109 --> 32:59.844
Now I do all those things...

33:00.670 --> 33:03.248
and I like to do it.
I am free, and I like to do it.

33:06.371 --> 33:08.820
May I come to your bed tonight?

33:20.058 --> 33:24.762
I'm here now.
I don't want your heart to die.

33:37.559 --> 33:40.029
You feel so sweet.

33:43.241 --> 33:45.623
My sweet little fool.

33:52.586 --> 33:54.807
I love you.

34:08.609 --> 34:12.510
You mustn't... you know?

34:14.933 --> 34:16.909
I won't.

34:16.909 --> 34:19.310
I promise.

35:31.892 --> 35:33.098
Your Majesty,

35:33.098 --> 35:35.898
Lady Bryan.

35:37.892 --> 35:40.805
Your Majesty. My Lord.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.514
Here is your son, Prince Edward.

35:47.740 --> 35:50.468
Your Majesty. Uncle.

35:50.468 --> 35:52.505
Your Grace.

36:07.412 --> 36:09.379
Edward.

36:10.128 --> 36:11.916
I trust you are well looked after

36:11.916 --> 36:13.508
and everybody is kind to you.

36:13.508 --> 36:16.499
Yes, sir.

36:18.762 --> 36:21.202
I have a gift for you.

36:32.270 --> 36:36.024
Thank you, Your Majesty.

36:37.670 --> 36:40.422
I have to go away
from London for a while.

36:40.422 --> 36:44.403
But your uncle will stay here.

36:45.516 --> 36:48.985
He is to be kept warm and
well at Windsor, Lady Bryan.

36:49.087 --> 36:52.578
And if, heaven forbid,
you should fall ill,

36:52.578 --> 36:56.970
dose him with this.
It's my own concoction.

37:05.133 --> 37:08.085
I can see your mother in you.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.348
Do you know who she was?

37:17.294 --> 37:19.261
This is her.

37:23.567 --> 37:26.569
And this is her thimble.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.937
You're a good boy.

37:50.804 --> 37:52.932
Your sword, sir.

38:19.541 --> 38:21.130
Your Majesty

38:21.643 --> 38:23.936
My Lady, the King is here.

38:24.851 --> 38:26.394
Katherine, I've come
to tell you that we are

38:26.394 --> 38:28.242
leaving Whitehall
in two days time.

38:28.242 --> 38:29.714
I trust you are prepared.

38:30.611 --> 38:32.962
Yes, Your Majesty.

38:33.136 --> 38:34.453
Oh, I've also come to tell you,

38:34.453 --> 38:36.711
the Lady Mary will
be accompanying us.

38:36.711 --> 38:40.207
Why?

38:40.207 --> 38:42.322
Must she come?

38:44.166 --> 38:46.148
Obviously you don't understand.

38:46.216 --> 38:48.342
Mary is a much-loved
figure in the North,

38:48.342 --> 38:51.540
where we mean to
impress our subjects.

38:51.540 --> 38:54.723
The decision has
nothing to do with you.

38:58.627 --> 39:00.971
I'm sorry I was not with child.

39:05.163 --> 39:07.900
I am sure I can be.

39:38.435 --> 39:40.862
Lift it!

39:42.055 --> 39:44.471
Keep moving!

39:45.542 --> 39:49.338
- Gather it up!
- Hay up!

39:50.680 --> 39:52.794
Boy!

39:58.822 --> 40:02.722
Keep in line! Fall in!

40:03.259 --> 40:06.698
You there!

40:19.533 --> 40:24.116
Keep moving! Keep up!

40:26.716 --> 40:28.884
There's the King!

40:28.952 --> 40:33.255
- The King!
- Lady Mary and the King!

41:06.715 --> 41:09.225
You see how much they love us?

41:09.559 --> 41:11.995
These are the real
people of England.

41:11.995 --> 41:14.296
They love their King.

41:26.191 --> 41:28.828
His Grace, Bishop Gardiner.

41:28.828 --> 41:32.403
My Lord. I trust I
am not disturbing you.

41:32.403 --> 41:35.591
I know you bear a heavy burden,
in His Majesty's absence.

41:35.591 --> 41:37.467
Not at all, Your Grace.
You are most welcome.

41:37.467 --> 41:40.674
- How goes the King's progress?
- Most excellently.

41:40.674 --> 41:42.369
He has been warmly and
graciously received

41:42.369 --> 41:45.016
everywhere he goes.
And he has had good sport.

41:45.016 --> 41:46.574
Just last week he
and his companions

41:46.574 --> 41:48.717
shot over four hundred
deer in two days.

41:49.307 --> 41:50.635
They're now on their
way to Lincoln.

41:50.635 --> 41:54.314
I am very glad to hear His
Majesty is in such good spirits.

41:55.138 --> 41:56.774
I suppose...

41:56.774 --> 42:01.158
he would number among his
companions the Earl of Surrey.

42:02.629 --> 42:03.881
Yes, for certain.

42:03.881 --> 42:05.811
- My Lord.
- Why?

42:05.811 --> 42:09.567
I have received more reports
of the Earl's behavior.

42:10.614 --> 42:12.574
It seems that,
after his investiture

42:12.574 --> 42:15.614
into the Order of the Garter,
he ppeared in a tavern

42:15.614 --> 42:18.725
in his regalia - and made
great fun of the Order

42:18.725 --> 42:21.310
and of those belonging to it.

42:21.310 --> 42:24.948
Even before bawds and pimps.

42:25.268 --> 42:27.697
And these are sworn
statements of his behavior?

42:27.697 --> 42:31.610
They are, my Lord.
Are you going to investigate further?

42:31.610 --> 42:33.386
Yes, I will.

42:33.386 --> 42:36.295
I am most grateful to Your
Grace for this information.

42:36.295 --> 42:39.487
I trust that someday
you will use it.

42:39.487 --> 42:42.095
For I am as convinced as I can be

42:42.095 --> 42:45.942
that Surrey and his crew
flout the fasting laws

42:46.597 --> 42:49.685
and are fanatic Lutherans
and Sacramentarians

42:49.685 --> 42:52.156
for which damnable heresies

42:52.156 --> 42:55.113
they ought to be
burned at Smithfield.

42:56.963 --> 42:59.137
Your Grace.

43:14.450 --> 43:21.356
Left, left, right, left,
right, left, right...

43:47.629 --> 43:52.000
{n8}Cathedral City of Lincoln

44:44.422 --> 44:48.222
Henry, by the Grace of God,

44:48.222 --> 44:52.232
King of England,
Ireland, and France;

44:52.232 --> 44:58.024
also God's high minister here,
Head of His Church

44:58.024 --> 45:01.858
and soul of the whole Kingdom.

45:01.858 --> 45:04.870
We beseech you in all humility

45:04.870 --> 45:09.341
to animate, rule,
and save your people.

45:09.341 --> 45:14.258
And we further pray God,
of his infinite mercy,

45:14.258 --> 45:18.722
that he will bless and
maintain in faith,

45:18.722 --> 45:21.803
in love, and in fecundity

45:21.803 --> 45:28.875
Queen Katherine and your
blessed daughter, Lady Mary.

45:30.099 --> 45:31.746
Amen.

45:32.116 --> 45:34.569
Amen.

45:36.402 --> 45:38.794
Your Majesty.

46:08.930 --> 46:11.041
People of Lincoln.

46:11.041 --> 46:16.687
Do I need to remind you many
of you here and about rose up

46:16.687 --> 46:20.938
in an unnatural and unlawful
rebellion against your King,

46:20.938 --> 46:23.601
who you, by the laws of God,

46:23.601 --> 46:25.407
are bound to obey.

46:26.830 --> 46:33.231
Well, today we come here for
an altogether different reason.

46:33.231 --> 46:37.910
Today we come here on a
Pilgrimage of Forgiveness.

46:37.910 --> 46:41.433
We are here to pardon all
our subjects for their

46:41.433 --> 46:44.150
past sins and disobedience.

46:44.150 --> 46:46.296
And since we have seen
how much you love us,

46:46.296 --> 46:50.365
and seen all your tokens
and signs of loyalty,

46:50.814 --> 46:56.062
with a free heart we forgive you.

47:10.046 --> 47:13.054
Here is Your
Majesty's bedchamber.

47:28.271 --> 47:29.694
Where does this go?

47:29.694 --> 47:31.341
To the Stool Chamber.

47:39.749 --> 47:42.255
And that?

47:42.255 --> 47:44.702
To the backstairs.

47:46.122 --> 47:48.895
Come on! I want to see.

48:09.721 --> 48:11.874
What's behind here? -

48:11.874 --> 48:13.584
His Majesty'bedchamber.

48:13.584 --> 48:15.597
With his servants?

48:30.867 --> 48:32.811
It looks bad,
doesn't it, Thomas?

48:32.811 --> 48:35.842
I have seen it better, Your Majesty.
But I'll bathe it.

48:38.135 --> 48:41.068
I wanted to visit
the Queen tonight.

48:41.577 --> 48:45.707
She looked so pure and beautiful
in the cathedral today.

48:45.707 --> 48:47.459
Don't you think?

48:47.459 --> 48:49.771
You were both magnificent.

48:50.394 --> 48:52.330
And the people adored and
worshipped Your Majesty,

48:52.330 --> 48:55.016
such as I have never
seen the like.

49:02.932 --> 49:05.467
Do you think the
King's asleep yet?

49:06.119 --> 49:07.794
He must be late.

49:07.794 --> 49:11.410
- It's almost midnight.
- Oh! Where is he?

49:25.346 --> 49:27.172
He has gone to sleep. -

49:27.172 --> 49:29.190
Go and fetch him. Hurry!

49:29.292 --> 49:30.992
Yes, my Lady.

49:32.159 --> 49:34.444
Help me change out of this.

49:52.334 --> 49:55.074
- Who's that?
- The night watchman.

49:55.968 --> 49:57.816
Come.

50:11.610 --> 50:13.945
I'll stay out here.

50:16.953 --> 50:19.682
I'll watch outside.

50:42.304 --> 50:43.831
Not in here!

50:44.148 --> 50:45.860
Where then?

50:51.206 --> 50:53.567
In here.

51:42.402 --> 51:44.409
Jesus Christ.
