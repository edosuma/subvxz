00:01.501 --> 00:02.068
This is the Evergreen

00:02.068 --> 00:03.436
This is the
Evergreen Forest.

00:03.436 --> 00:04.871
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.340 --> 00:10.010
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.711
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.046 --> 00:15.348
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.049 --> 00:17.117
Yikes!

00:17.951 --> 00:19.019
Yaaaah...

00:22.088 --> 00:23.423
Yeaaaah!

00:23.423 --> 00:26.393
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.169
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.704 --> 00:38.905
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.876 --> 00:44.978
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:45.812 --> 00:46.980
the Raccoons!!

00:46.980 --> 00:49.315
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:01.327 --> 01:03.063
If you are looking
for an adventure,

01:03.063 --> 01:06.433
you can find it anywhere your
imagination takes you.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.868
Whether it's between the
covers of a book,

01:08.868 --> 01:10.670
or in your own backyard.

01:10.670 --> 01:14.207
But even the greatest
adventurers like Bert Raccoon,

01:14.207 --> 01:17.310
sometimes need a little help
getting started.

01:19.379 --> 01:21.448
The blazing tropical sun

01:21.448 --> 01:24.017
beat down upon the explorers

01:24.017 --> 01:26.753
as they hacked their way through

01:26.753 --> 01:29.756
the dank jungle undergrowth.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.692
Couldn't you at least
give us a hand here, Bert?

01:32.692 --> 01:35.328
I'm just getting
to the good part, Ralph.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.064
Never mind, Bert.

01:38.064 --> 01:39.866
We're at the water, anyway.

01:39.866 --> 01:42.535
Now you and Cedric
be careful out there.

01:42.535 --> 01:45.071
We didn't build this
boat to be careful.

01:45.071 --> 01:47.140
We built it to explore

01:47.140 --> 01:51.144
the mysterious
Beaver Bite Swamp.

01:51.144 --> 01:54.380
Come on, Broo, it's time to
leave civilization behind.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.851
We'll be
back for dinner!

01:57.851 --> 02:01.187
Explorers don't come
back but dinner, Cedric!

02:01.187 --> 02:02.956
They do
if they're hungry.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.525
Cedric/Bert:

02:08.194 --> 02:09.896
They followed the river deeper

02:09.896 --> 02:11.564
into the jungle depths.

02:11.564 --> 02:14.033
A steaming air was shattered by

02:14.033 --> 02:16.469
the cries of predators and prey.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.140
Grrrrrr!

02:24.077 --> 02:26.112
That's
pretty good, Bert!

02:26.112 --> 02:29.015
Beneath the greasy green waters,

02:29.015 --> 02:32.986
giant crocodiles waiting
for unwary victims!

02:32.986 --> 02:35.021
Uaaah! Ah-haaa!

02:35.021 --> 02:36.456
And then ahead,

02:36.456 --> 02:40.026
the exhausted explorers
sited their goal,

02:40.026 --> 02:42.962
the lost city of Bukhara!

02:42.962 --> 02:44.964
Bert, watch it.
We're going to...

02:44.964 --> 02:46.533
Uaaaaah!
Woaaah!

02:50.436 --> 02:52.739
Oooh! Aaaah!
Yaaaah! Ooh!

02:52.739 --> 02:54.207
Heeeeelp!
Ouh!

02:54.207 --> 02:55.241
Heeeelp!

03:02.515 --> 03:04.951
Nooo! Oooh! Heeeelp!

03:08.988 --> 03:11.324
Right lucky I came by.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.661
Y-ye-yeah!

03:14.661 --> 03:16.629
Thanks.

03:16.629 --> 03:19.299
I-i-if you
don't mind me asking,

03:19.299 --> 03:21.968
w-wh-who-who are you?

03:21.968 --> 03:23.803
Most folks
call me Herman,

03:23.803 --> 03:26.039
Of course, I'm the only
folks hereabouts.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.212
Ain't you
the cute little fella?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.479
That's Broo.

03:33.479 --> 03:36.382
Well, I reckon
you're Bert and...

03:36.382 --> 03:37.884
you must be Cedric.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.652
How do you know that?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.956
Well.. you fellas
yell real loud!

03:44.524 --> 03:46.125
Well, here we are.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.061
Come on, we'll
get you cleaned up.

03:56.035 --> 03:57.804
Uaaaah!

03:57.804 --> 03:58.771
Yeaaaah!

03:58.771 --> 04:00.340
Uaaaah-uh!

04:00.340 --> 04:02.108
Uaaaaah!

04:02.108 --> 04:03.376
Ugh!

04:04.344 --> 04:05.578
Don't worry,

04:05.578 --> 04:07.413
these vines are mighty strong.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.216
Besides that, you can get
enough sweet water out of 'em

04:10.216 --> 04:12.485
to keep you from
ever getting thirsty.

04:12.485 --> 04:13.920
Here!

04:13.920 --> 04:15.154
Try it.

04:15.154 --> 04:17.023
Bert/Cedric:

04:17.023 --> 04:18.391
Mmmm!

04:18.391 --> 04:19.959
Ouch!

04:19.959 --> 04:21.027
Ouuuch!
Here, rub this on.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.228
Keeps the mosquitos off.

04:25.798 --> 04:27.200
Hey, that's terrific!

04:27.200 --> 04:29.869
Wow! Amazing!

04:31.170 --> 04:32.705
You lived here long,
Herman?

04:32.705 --> 04:33.773
All my life!

04:33.773 --> 04:36.743
Like my pappy and my
grand-pappy before him.

04:36.743 --> 04:39.178
Now, go get yourselves clean.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.548
That's delicious!

04:42.548 --> 04:45.318
Thanks. That's
my special bark tea.

04:45.318 --> 04:46.619
Take some back with you.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.454
There's a tin right
there on that shelf.

04:49.155 --> 04:50.790
Which one, Herman?

04:50.790 --> 04:52.759
They all look the same.

04:52.759 --> 04:53.926
Third from the left.

04:55.228 --> 04:58.464
Wouldn't it be easier,
if you made labels for them?

04:58.464 --> 05:01.701
Well uh, don't need
labels if you got a good memory.

05:02.535 --> 05:04.237
Huh?

05:04.237 --> 05:07.307
Oh, you're right, Broo,
it is getting late.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.777
We better get back before our
friends start to worry, Herman.

05:10.777 --> 05:12.412
I'll see ya' safely out.

05:12.412 --> 05:15.615
It's right easy to get yourself
turned around in the swamp.

05:15.615 --> 05:18.284
Don't forget your book,
it's dry now.

05:18.284 --> 05:20.286
You saved
our lives, Herman,

05:20.286 --> 05:21.487
I'd like you to have it.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.723
Uhm.. you haven't
read it, have you?

05:23.723 --> 05:26.893
Uhm, can't
make out the title.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.961
Must have misplaced my glasses.

05:28.961 --> 05:32.632
It's called
'Jungle Adventure'.

05:32.632 --> 05:33.900
I bet you'd like it.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.803
Uh, I'm sure,
I would Bert, thank you.

05:40.340 --> 05:44.477
Heeeey, those
swamp shoes look like fun!

05:44.477 --> 05:45.978
Yep, they are!

05:45.978 --> 05:48.381
Boy, this swamp sure is

05:48.381 --> 05:50.783
an amazing place, Herman!

05:50.783 --> 05:52.819
Yeah, lots of
history in the swamp.

05:52.819 --> 05:55.922
Million years ago, it
looked just the same.

05:55.922 --> 05:58.591
Of course, now those ancient
trees are under the swamp,

05:58.591 --> 06:00.126
turning into oil.

06:00.126 --> 06:03.329
You mean there might be
oil under this swamp?

06:04.931 --> 06:06.399
I don't see why not.

06:06.799 --> 06:09.168
Well, there's the
edge of the swamp.

06:09.168 --> 06:10.503
Thanks, Herman.

06:10.503 --> 06:13.106
We'll come and visit you
sometime, if it's okay?

06:13.106 --> 06:15.208
Whenever
you like. Bye now!

06:15.208 --> 06:17.510
Bert/Cedric:
Bye! Thanks a lot!

06:19.345 --> 06:19.746
He was really

06:19.746 --> 06:21.481
He was
really something, Pop.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.883
He knows all the
plants and birds

06:23.883 --> 06:25.818
and the history of the swamp.

06:25.818 --> 06:29.322
He even told us about
the oil under the swamp.

06:29.322 --> 06:30.623
Oil?!

06:30.623 --> 06:32.024
Amazing, isn't it?

06:32.024 --> 06:33.893
Well, see you at dinner pop.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.962
Oil! Huh!

06:35.962 --> 06:39.565
I don't own
Beaver Bite Swamp... yet,

06:39.565 --> 06:40.900
but I will!

06:40.900 --> 06:42.335
Pigs!

06:42.335 --> 06:45.171
Piiigs!!
The Pigs: Yes, Sir! Yes, Sir!

06:45.171 --> 06:47.340
Get down to the
Land Registry office.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.375
Find out who does
own that swamp.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.711
The Pigs: Yes, Sir!
Right away, Sir.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.212
Oil!!

06:53.212 --> 06:57.183
Black Gold! Texas tea!!

06:57.183 --> 07:00.019
Barrels and barrels
of beautiful crude.

07:00.019 --> 07:01.921
I'm rich! I mean, I'm richer!

07:01.921 --> 07:05.024
Ha ha! It's all mine,
just for the taking!

07:08.161 --> 07:10.863
And he picked us up,
right out of the swamp.

07:10.863 --> 07:14.200
And that's not all!
He's got these swamp shoes.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.270
I'm gonna make some
for me and Cedric. And then...

07:17.270 --> 07:20.072
We'd like to
hear all about it, Bert,

07:20.072 --> 07:22.241
after you have a bath.

07:22.241 --> 07:23.709
Uh!

07:23.709 --> 07:25.812
Hey, what's the matter?

07:25.812 --> 07:29.615
Haven't you ever smelled
a jungle explorer before?

07:31.117 --> 07:32.952
Oh my, my, my, my, my!

07:32.952 --> 07:34.787
This is mighty peculiar.

07:34.787 --> 07:37.457
We don't seem to
have a deed on file.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.625
No deed, no deed at all!

07:39.625 --> 07:41.194
The Pig 1: Well,
what's that mean?

07:41.194 --> 07:44.464
Well, it means that
you can buy it, if you want.

07:44.464 --> 07:48.201
Though why you'd want a swamp
is beyond me.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.268
The Pig 2: We'll take it!

07:49.268 --> 07:50.903
No, no, no, no, no!

07:50.903 --> 07:52.271
Not so fast.

07:52.271 --> 07:54.607
First of all, you'll
have to register a claim

07:54.607 --> 07:57.510
and pay the $25 fee.

07:57.510 --> 08:00.446
After a 48 hour
waiting period,

08:00.446 --> 08:02.648
the swamp will be yours.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.784
That'll be uh...

08:04.784 --> 08:06.886
5:00 o'clock on Tuesday.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.888
The Pigs: Oh, goodie goodie!

08:08.888 --> 08:10.656
But first,

08:10.656 --> 08:13.326
fill out this in quadruplicate.

08:16.963 --> 08:19.332
Ha-haaa! 25 bucks!

08:19.332 --> 08:21.100
Best deal I ever made.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.536
It'll be all mine on Tuesday!

08:24.737 --> 08:27.907
The Pig: Well, Sir,
unless somebody turns up

08:27.907 --> 08:30.943
with the original
deed before then...

08:30.943 --> 08:32.812
Don't bother
me with details!

08:32.812 --> 08:35.648
In less than two days,
the swamp will be mine!

08:35.648 --> 08:39.185
And no one, no one is
going to stop me!

08:48.728 --> 08:50.830
The Pig: Keep out!

08:50.830 --> 08:53.966
Do you think the boss will
give us a raise if we find oil?

08:53.966 --> 08:56.536
The Pig 2: I know what
he'll do it if we don't!

09:02.508 --> 09:03.843
The Pig 1: Eh-e-eh-ah!

09:08.881 --> 09:10.383
The Pig 2:

09:21.260 --> 09:22.295
Oiiiink!

09:22.295 --> 09:24.764
The Pigs: Yikes! Who are you?

09:24.764 --> 09:28.768
I was just about to
ask you that same question.

09:28.768 --> 09:32.672
The Pig: We work for
Sneer Oil Explorations,

09:32.672 --> 09:36.676
the biggest oil company
in existence.

09:36.676 --> 09:37.843
Almost!

09:37.843 --> 09:41.347
So just, what do you
think you're doing here?

09:41.347 --> 09:42.882
The Pig 2:
Can't you read?!

09:42.882 --> 09:44.917
I'll ask
the questions here?

09:44.917 --> 09:48.387
The Pig: Y-yu-you're the one
who's t-tr-tre-trespassing?

09:48.387 --> 09:49.522
Uaaaah!

09:49.522 --> 09:52.258
The Pig:
Uh, wi-wi-will be.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.760
What are you talking
about? And make it fast!

09:54.760 --> 09:57.029
I'm getting a mite
short-tempered!

09:57.029 --> 09:59.332
The Pig: At 5 PM tomorrow,

09:59.332 --> 10:02.068
Cyril Sneer will own this land

10:02.068 --> 10:03.903
and you'll be out!

10:07.073 --> 10:08.708
The Pig: T-th-that's the law.

10:08.708 --> 10:11.444
I'd suggest
you leave my swamp,

10:11.444 --> 10:13.479
and don't come back,

10:13.479 --> 10:16.015
if you know what's good for ya'.

10:16.015 --> 10:18.718
Now, run along home
and tell your boss,

10:18.718 --> 10:21.487
he can do his exploring
somewhere else!

10:28.628 --> 10:30.396
Well, what's the verdict?

10:30.396 --> 10:33.065
The Pig 1: Well Sir,
we fractionated...

10:33.065 --> 10:34.634
The Pig 2: Sedimentated...

10:34.634 --> 10:36.802
analyzed,
crystallized...

10:36.802 --> 10:39.639
The Pig 3: And it all comes
down to the same thing.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.574
Get on with it!
I haven't got all day!

10:41.574 --> 10:46.045
The Pig 1: Well, it seems that
there's a lot of oil, Sir.

10:46.045 --> 10:51.050
I knew it!! The Sneer
nose knows where money is!

10:52.785 --> 10:54.920
The Pig 2: But, Sir, we were
thinking, Sir, that, um...

10:54.920 --> 10:58.224
maybe we should
explore elsewhere? Um...

10:58.224 --> 11:00.459
What's that?
The Pig 2: Yes, Sir, elsewhere...

11:00.459 --> 11:03.729
...with less mosquitoes.
I hate being bit.

11:03.729 --> 11:06.265
Bit? You are a bacon bit!

11:06.265 --> 11:08.634
Get out there and get started!

11:08.634 --> 11:12.605
The Pig 1: Well, there is
one small hitch, Sir.

11:12.605 --> 11:15.007
The Pig 2: Yes Sir,
uh.. a hermit!

11:15.007 --> 11:17.710
Uh, well, he's sort of asked us

11:17.710 --> 11:20.279
not to come back again, Sir.

11:20.279 --> 11:22.848
The Pig 3: I think
he meant it, Sir.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.484
Get back there and tell
that hermit he'd better be

11:25.484 --> 11:29.321
out of my swamp by 5 o'clock
tomorrow or else!

11:29.321 --> 11:32.491
And I don't wanna hear anymore
of your pig-brained excuses.

11:32.491 --> 11:36.162
The Pig: But, Sir,
he's, he's scary!!

11:36.162 --> 11:38.898
Scary!?
What does that make me?

11:38.898 --> 11:40.366
Mr Nice Guy?

11:40.366 --> 11:42.501
The Pig: N-n-no, Sir!

11:42.501 --> 11:44.470
Then get going
before I turn you into

11:44.470 --> 11:46.205
a set of matched luggage.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.973
The Pigs: Yes, Sir, yes Sir!

11:47.973 --> 11:49.341
Oink-oink!

11:50.776 --> 11:52.712
Mammoth, yeah,

11:52.712 --> 11:54.947
what do you charge
for an oil rig?

11:54.947 --> 11:57.516
That much, eh?

11:57.516 --> 12:01.220
Yeah yeah, I'll
take a dozen, for now!

12:01.220 --> 12:04.090
I'll need more later.
Yeah, yeah...

12:04.090 --> 12:06.125
Is it a big oil strike?

12:06.125 --> 12:08.360
Well, it's bigger
than a breadbox.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.798
Boy, these swamp shoes

12:12.798 --> 12:14.567
take a little getting used to.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.570
Uaah-ouh-ups!

12:17.570 --> 12:20.706
You can't become a
great jungle explorer

12:20.706 --> 12:23.175
like me, overnight.

12:23.175 --> 12:25.644
Huh, it takes a
little practice, Cedric.

12:25.644 --> 12:28.881
Like.. uaaah!

12:28.881 --> 12:31.617
I guess, practice
makes perfect, right Bert?

12:33.519 --> 12:34.553
Huh?!

12:38.724 --> 12:41.594
Hey, I wonder
what they're up too?

12:41.594 --> 12:44.096
Looks like they're
headed for Herman.

12:44.096 --> 12:47.299
Well, let's find
out what's happening.

12:50.836 --> 12:54.039
Thought I told you
not to bother coming back here.

12:54.406 --> 12:57.276
Now that ya' scared off the
fish, what do you want?

12:57.276 --> 12:59.044
The Pig: Ehm, uhm...

12:59.044 --> 13:02.782
We are here to deliver
official legal papers.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.419
The Pig 2: Read 'em and weep!

13:07.419 --> 13:09.455
I-I don't have
time to waste

13:09.455 --> 13:11.357
readin' every paper
that comes along.

13:12.258 --> 13:13.359
What does it say?

13:13.359 --> 13:15.561
The Pig: That this
is Cyril Sneer's

13:15.561 --> 13:18.631
true and level
claim to the swamp!

13:18.631 --> 13:21.433
But this is my swamp!
Always has been!

13:21.433 --> 13:23.969
The Pig: Not according
to the Land Registry.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.871
The Pig 2:
By tomorrow at 5 PM,

13:25.871 --> 13:28.574
it will be Cyril
Sneer's swamp.

13:28.574 --> 13:30.776
The Pig 3: Better start packing!

13:30.776 --> 13:32.411
The Pig 2: Right now!!

13:37.917 --> 13:41.387
Yaaaaahooooo!

13:41.387 --> 13:44.156
Hiya, Herman!
Hi, Herman!

13:45.991 --> 13:48.227
(sadly) Hi.
What's wrong, Herman?

13:48.227 --> 13:50.563
I just had
a visit from the Pigs.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.464
They gave me this.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.769
They can't do this!!

13:56.769 --> 13:59.572
They can't throw you
out of your own swamp!!

13:59.572 --> 14:01.307
I don't know, Bert.

14:01.307 --> 14:03.142
It looks pretty legal,

14:03.142 --> 14:06.145
Oh, Pop, how could you?

14:06.145 --> 14:08.414
But you're going to fight
this, aren't you, Herman?

14:08.414 --> 14:10.182
I don't see how it can.

14:10.783 --> 14:15.287
It's all down there in black
and white, isn't it, Cedric?

14:15.287 --> 14:17.323
It sure looks that way.

14:17.323 --> 14:19.758
But you gotta
fight it, Herman!!

14:19.758 --> 14:22.628
I can't fight
marks on paper, Bert.

14:22.628 --> 14:25.664
I can't fight what
I don't understand.

14:25.664 --> 14:28.601
I'm just a stupid old man.

14:29.468 --> 14:32.504
If those papers say
I have to leave my home,

14:32.504 --> 14:34.607
then I guess I better go.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.810
But, Herman.. I-I
don't understand. We did...

14:37.810 --> 14:40.546
That's right, Bert,
you don't understand,

14:40.546 --> 14:42.815
and I'm not going to explain it.

14:42.815 --> 14:45.184
I believe in this swamp.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.391
I see. You're sure?

14:52.858 --> 14:56.629
Well... no, thank you.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.231
So, it's all a
mistake, right Ralph?

14:59.231 --> 15:01.800
Wrong, Bert.
According to the clerk

15:01.800 --> 15:03.736
at the Land Registry office,

15:03.736 --> 15:05.738
everything's perfectly legal.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.741
There must be
something we can do.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.478
Sorry, Bert, but
without the original deed,

15:12.478 --> 15:15.180
that swamp is up for grabs.

15:17.216 --> 15:19.685
The Pig 1: That was
easier than I thought.

15:19.685 --> 15:23.989
The Pig 2: Yeah! There's nothing
to this oil drilling business.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.724
The Pig 1: Well done, boy.

15:25.724 --> 15:28.494
The Pig 3:
Well done.

15:28.494 --> 15:31.330
Get it? Well done!

15:31.330 --> 15:34.099
The Pigs:

15:36.235 --> 15:39.271
Yeah, it was
a great old house.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.240
Where are you
gonna go, Herman?

15:41.240 --> 15:43.409
Oh, I don't know.

15:43.409 --> 15:46.078
Must be another
place for me somewhere.

15:46.078 --> 15:49.114
I still think you're
giving up too easily.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.317
We can help you fight this!

15:51.317 --> 15:54.720
Are you sure you
don't have a deed, Herman?

15:54.720 --> 15:56.755
It's too
late for all that.

15:56.755 --> 15:58.624
It's just too late.

16:00.926 --> 16:02.594
Well.. Goodbye fellas.

16:02.594 --> 16:04.730
Goodbye, Herman.

16:04.730 --> 16:06.532
Bye! Take care.

16:09.234 --> 16:10.936
The Pig 1: It's done, Sir!

16:10.936 --> 16:13.472
The Pig 2: The rig is rigged.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.075
The Pig 3: It's
floating. Yes, Sir!

16:16.075 --> 16:19.411
About time! We start
drilling at 5 o'clock.

16:19.411 --> 16:21.981
Go take a shower.
You smell like pigs!

16:21.981 --> 16:24.283
You look, smell and are pigs!

16:25.651 --> 16:28.587
Mammoth?! Yeah, it's me again.

16:28.587 --> 16:31.924
Ha, Cyril! The oil magnet!

16:31.924 --> 16:34.426
Get me drills, refineries.

16:34.426 --> 16:37.429
Yeah, and throw in a few
gas stations too, will you?

Ah, it's not your fault.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.589
There's no point

18:14.860 --> 18:17.696
Herman old pal!
You're back!

18:17.696 --> 18:18.931
Yeah, I'm back.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.567
And I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

18:21.567 --> 18:24.203
There's something I
haven't told you, Bert.

18:24.203 --> 18:26.271
There's something,
I've been too...

18:26.271 --> 18:28.107
ashamed to tell anyone.

18:29.241 --> 18:32.377
I've never been scared of
anything in my life.

18:32.377 --> 18:34.780
But I've always been
afraid people would

18:34.780 --> 18:36.849
laugh at me, if they know, I...

18:36.849 --> 18:38.550
I can't read.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.185
But you were right, Bert.

18:40.185 --> 18:43.055
I can't just give up
my home without a fight.

18:43.055 --> 18:46.758
I'm a proud man and it's
hard for me to ask, but...

18:46.758 --> 18:48.427
I need your help.

18:48.427 --> 18:50.229
We'd be proud
to help you, Herman.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.266
My pappy gave
these to me a long time ago.

18:54.266 --> 18:55.934
Told me to keep 'em safe.

18:55.934 --> 18:58.770
Maybe there's something written
in them that could help.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.909
Ha! I-I-I
don't believe it!

19:03.909 --> 19:06.879
Herman, do you realize
what you got here?

19:06.879 --> 19:10.149
The deed to Beaver Bite Swamp!

19:10.883 --> 19:12.417
You own it, Herman!

19:12.417 --> 19:14.052
Yahooo!

19:14.052 --> 19:15.654
You own it!!!

19:17.489 --> 19:19.491
Well, he won't own
it, if we don't get down

19:19.491 --> 19:21.326
to the Land Registry office.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.095
We've got less than an hour

19:23.095 --> 19:25.397
before Cyril owns the swamp!

19:25.397 --> 19:26.798
Hmm...

19:33.071 --> 19:36.642
(reading) Gone to the
opening of Sneer Oil field,

19:36.642 --> 19:39.811
now located in
Beaver Bite Swamp!

19:39.811 --> 19:43.615
Oh no! We'll never
make it there in time!

19:43.615 --> 19:46.018
We're sure gonna
give it a try. Come on!

19:46.852 --> 19:47.920
The Pig: Five more minutes!

19:47.920 --> 19:51.423
And you'll be an oil maggot,
uhm magnate, Sir.

19:51.423 --> 19:53.692
I don't see
why we have to wait.

19:53.692 --> 19:54.760
Give me those scissors!

19:54.760 --> 19:57.129
Mr Sneer,

19:57.129 --> 20:00.165
we must wait until
5 o'clock sharp!

20:00.165 --> 20:03.001
Rules are not made to be broken.

20:03.001 --> 20:04.836
I hate rules!

20:04.836 --> 20:07.673
If there's another
person who claims this swamp,

20:07.673 --> 20:09.508
we must be fair.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.276
Look out!!

20:11.276 --> 20:12.511
Oh no!

20:12.511 --> 20:15.547
Don't worry, this
is a shortcut. Follow me!

20:15.547 --> 20:21.653

20:21.653 --> 20:22.654
Uaaaah!

Yahoooo! Uaaaah!

20:28.126 --> 20:29.127
Wooohooo!

20:29.127 --> 20:31.330
The Pig: Ten, nine, eight,

20:31.330 --> 20:32.564
Hold it right there!

20:37.903 --> 20:41.173
Cedric?!
Oh, hi, Pop!

20:41.173 --> 20:44.710
What do you raccoons
think you're doing in my swamp?

20:44.710 --> 20:47.212
Hah! Your swamp?

20:47.212 --> 20:50.048
Yes, my swamp!

20:50.048 --> 20:52.417
You Raccoons, get
out of here, pronto.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.753
I think you'll
find this in order.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.489
It's my deed to the swamp.

20:57.489 --> 21:00.158
It's a fake!!
It's got to be.

21:00.158 --> 21:04.029
It looks perfectly
genuine to me, Mr Sneer.

21:04.029 --> 21:07.899
Oh my, I'm afraid you're
trespassing on, uhm,

21:07.899 --> 21:11.937
Herman Zachariah Stroll's swamp.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.940
And that's the law, Mr Sneer.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.543
Yahoooo!
Hip-hip-hooray!

21:18.543 --> 21:20.178
Way to go, Hermie!

21:22.214 --> 21:23.882
Hiya, Herman!
Are you ready

21:23.882 --> 21:25.550
for your next reading lesson?

21:25.550 --> 21:28.120
Hi, Bert! I thought
we'd have dinner first.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.288
Sit yourself down.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.623
Ah!

21:31.623 --> 21:33.425
What are you cooking?

21:33.425 --> 21:34.626
I'm not sure.

21:34.626 --> 21:39.197
It, um, smells a...
eh-eh, bit strange.

21:39.197 --> 21:41.233
You're
absolutely right, Bert!

21:41.233 --> 21:44.069
And the first thing I want
to do, when I learn how to read,

21:44.069 --> 21:46.004
is get a cookbook!

21:46.004 --> 21:48.440
Bert/Herman:

21:49.975 --> 21:50.509
Mammoth, you know all

21:50.509 --> 21:52.077
Mammoth, you know
all those refineries

21:52.077 --> 21:52.511
nkers I ordered? Heh heh.

21:54.846 --> 21:57.015
I want to return it all. Ha.

21:57.015 --> 22:00.419
Yeah, I want to return
all those oil rigs too.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.522
What do you mean
I can't return it?

22:03.522 --> 22:05.957
Brand new! Never been used.

22:06.858 --> 22:08.660
Did I read the small print?

22:08.660 --> 22:10.796
Of course I read
the small print!

22:10.796 --> 22:13.432
Quick!
Read the small print.

22:15.801 --> 22:16.802
The Pig:

22:16.802 --> 22:19.271
I-I think you
should read it, Sir.

22:19.271 --> 22:23.175
It says right here:
all sales final.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.943
What?! No, Mammoth,

22:25.711 --> 22:27.979
There's, there's no problem.

22:27.979 --> 22:29.247
