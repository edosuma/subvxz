blood and urine test would be

most accurate, so we are going
to a doctor that I see for food

wanting to do a health test, and
we tried, like, a sweat thing

23:11.333 --> 23:14.433
that didn't really work.
>> KIM: I just want, like,

23:14.433 --> 23:18.066
'cause Kourtney is gluten-free
and I'm not, I want to see who's

23:18.066 --> 23:19.767
healthier.

me that I should be gluten-free.
>> JONATHAN: We want to know, is

23:25.033 --> 23:26.767
this a shrink's office?
'Cause we think Kourtney's

23:26.767 --> 23:28.400
insane.
I want to know what kind of

23:28.400 --> 23:30.200
doctor's office we're in.
>> KIM: Yeah, like, just the

23:30.200 --> 23:32.000
gluten-free crackers.
>> JONATHAN: Gluten-free cheese.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.400
>> KOURTNEY: Gluten-free cheese.
>> DR. BYRNES: What Kourtney is

23:35.400 --> 23:37.567
really doing, which, to some
people, seems extreme, but

23:37.567 --> 23:41.000
she's doing what she needs to
do to get herself feeling as

23:41.000 --> 23:42.834
good as she can, and being as
healthy as she can.

>> JONATHAN: Is it, like, a

23:56.967 --> 23:58.734
needle blood test?
>> DR. BYRNES: Yep, yep.

23:58.734 --> 24:00.600
>> JONATHAN: Meaning that's,
like, blood off the veins, or,

24:00.600 --> 24:02.233
like, a finger?
>> DR. BYRNES: No, in the arm.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.834

37:26.233 --> 37:29.800
gluten-free can actually be more
harmful for you.

>> DR. RHONDA: I-I actually know

37:39.567 --> 37:42.600
the-the study you were referring
to, and they found that people

37:42.600 --> 37:47.300
that ate gluten-free diets had,
like, twice as much arsenic and,

37:47.300 --> 37:49.633
like, 70% more mercury in their
blood.

37:49.633 --> 37:53.433

Kim, just being gluten-free is

37:53.433 --> 37:57.266
not unhealthy.
It's like if you're gluten-free

37:57.266 --> 38:00.066
and just eating a lot of
processed foods, which,

38:00.066 --> 38:02.867
gluten-free or not, that's just
not good, anyways.

38:02.867 --> 38:04.900
>> DR. RHONDA: Exactly.
Gluten-free diets have become

38:04.900 --> 38:07.233
such a fad that people are just
buying all this, like...

38:07.233 --> 38:09.567
>> KOURTNEY: Gluten-free, yeah.
>> DR. RHONDA: Packaged, yeah.

38:09.567 --> 38:12.800
And a lot of times what people
do is they'll substitute rice

38:12.800 --> 38:16.600
flour, and rice bioaccumulates
mercury and arsenic.

38:16.600 --> 38:18.800
In my mind, when I read this
study, what I started to think

38:18.800 --> 38:20.900
about was, "What about all the
people eating rice?

38:20.900 --> 38:23.367
Like, in China or, you know,
Japan."

38:23.367 --> 38:25.467
>> KIM: Yeah, for breakfast.
>> DR. RHONDA: Yeah, so this is

38:25.467 --> 38:27.834
kind of a field of study I'm,
like, obsessed with.

38:27.834 --> 38:31.667
It's called nutrigenomics, where
basically, like, thousands of

38:31.667 --> 38:34.500
years ago, people have come from
different parts of the world and

38:34.500 --> 38:37.834
you weren't really traveling
much then, so you kind of, like,

38:37.834 --> 38:40.066
were beholden to the food that
you could grow in that region,

38:40.066 --> 38:41.900
right?
And the theory is that people

38:41.900 --> 38:44.166
have similar genes, but we have
different variations in these

38:44.166 --> 38:46.266
genes.
And so, some people can process

38:46.266 --> 38:48.967
carbs better, some people can
process fat better, some people

38:48.967 --> 38:51.700
can process, uh, lactose better
or gluten, like, things like

38:51.700 --> 38:53.133
that.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

38:53.133 --> 38:55.233
>> KIM: So, basically, eat
everything in moderation because

38:55.233 --> 38:56.834
we're  at some point,
either way.

38:56.834 --> 38:57.967
>> JONATHAN: Yeah, you can't win
either way.

38:57.967 --> 38:59.333
>> DR. RHONDA: But you sweat.
You could sweat this stuff out,

38:59.333 --> 39:02.367
too.
You sweat mercury, arsenic, uh,

39:02.367 --> 39:04.166
all these heavy metals out of
your...

39:04.166 --> 39:05.166
>> KIM: Really?
>> DR. RHONDA: Yeah.

39:05.166 --> 39:06.333
>> KOURTNEY: Like, with steam?
>> KIM: I didn't know that.

39:06.333 --> 39:08.533
>> DR. RHONDA: Yeah, steam
rooms, saunas, exercise...

39:08.533 --> 39:09.867
>> KOURTNEY: Sitting in this
room.

39:09.867 --> 39:12.467
>> JONATHAN: Right? I think
I just lost, like, 13... 13

39:12.467 --> 39:13.734
ounces of cadmium.
>> KOURTNEY: I just turned the

39:13.734 --> 39:15.133
the air on.
I'm so sorry it's so hot in

39:15.133 --> 39:18.133
here.
But there is no benefit to

39:18.133 --> 39:20.734
eating gluten for anybody,
right?

39:20.734 --> 39:23.867
>> DR. RHONDA: The only benefit
is that most of the foods that

39:23.867 --> 39:27.500
gluten is found in have a lot of
fiber.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.166
>> KOURTNEY: Okay.
>> DR. RHONDA: And so...

39:29.166 --> 39:31.533
: The fiber is so
damn important.

39:31.533 --> 39:32.767
>> KOURTNEY: Okay.
>> DR. RHONDA: But there are

39:32.767 --> 39:34.533
things you can do to counter it.
Other food sources of fiber

39:34.533 --> 39:37.300
include vegetables, fruits,
seeds, nuts.

39:37.300 --> 39:39.300
>> KOURTNEY: I'm gonna look into
my fiber and how much I'm

39:39.300 --> 39:41.133
getting.
>> DR. RHONDA: Yeah, it really

39:41.133 --> 39:43.600
makes a difference.
>> KIM: From this experience,

39:43.600 --> 39:46.066
I've definitely learned that
it's just not that simple.

39:46.066 --> 39:48.533
Like, there isn't a perfect
science, and my lifestyle is

39:48.533 --> 39:51.033
working for me and Kourtney's
lifestyle is working for her.

39:51.033 --> 39:52.734
>> KOURTNEY: Are you
gluten

39:52.734 --> 39:54.467
>> DR. RHONDA: I try to eat a
diet that's mostly, like, whole

39:54.467 --> 39:56.367
foods.
Like, I try to avoid the

39:56.367 --> 39:58.900
processed foods and the packaged
foods and all that, and so it

39:58.900 --> 40:01.433
sort of ends up being mostly
gluten-free.

40:01.433 --> 40:02.800
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> DR. RHONDA: So I'll eat,

40:02.800 --> 40:05.734
like, chicken. I eat steak.
I eat, um, salmon.

40:05.734 --> 40:09.266
But I also, like, eat like a
vegetarian because I eat so many

40:09.266 --> 40:11.133
vegetables in, like, wide
variety.

40:11.133 --> 40:12.633
>> KIM: Ugh, I wish I could do
that.

40:12.633 --> 40:14.300
I just, like, can't eat...
>> KOURTNEY: All I'm eating

40:14.300 --> 40:17.200
right now is vegetables, fruit
and protein.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.333
>> JONATHAN: Aren't you
starving?

40:18.333 --> 40:19.734
>> KOURTNEY: No.
>> KIM: It's so hard for me.

40:19.734 --> 40:21.000
>> DR. RHONDA: Once you start
doing it, though...

40:21.000 --> 40:23.300
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah, once you get
used to it, like, it takes... I

40:23.300 --> 40:27.266
would say it takes two weeks to
really get used to it.

40:27.266 --> 40:29.533
>> JONATHAN: Cool. I'm starving.
>> KIM: You are?

40:29.533 --> 40:31.266
>> JONATHAN: Yeah.
>> KOURTNEY: Um, do we have any

40:31.266 --> 40:33.500
other questions?
>> JONATHAN: No, just how fast

40:33.500 --> 40:36.467
can you get a pizza over here?

40:36.467 --> 40:38.133
>> KIM: Thank you so much for
coming out.

40:38.133 --> 40:40.734
>> KOURTNEY: Thank you.
♪ ♪

40:40.734 --> 40:42.433
>> MJ: I'm having a ball.
Thank you.

40:42.433 --> 40:44.667
>> KHLOE: What are we doing?
>> MJ: We're winning.

40:44.667 --> 40:46.633
>> JONATHAN: Heaven.

40:48.734 --> 40:51.500
>> KHLOE: Hello?
>> KIM: What are you doing here?

40:51.500 --> 40:57.700
>> KHLOE: Hi.
Well, I had to ambush you.

40:57.700 --> 41:00.200
Why have you been avoiding me?

41:02.300 --> 41:04.300
>> KIM: I mean, I've just been
laying low.

41:04.300 --> 41:07.734
You called me a disloyal person.
I'm just, like, over it 'cause

41:07.734 --> 41:11.500
I'm not.
I'm gonna lay low on that

41:11.500 --> 41:13.333
energy, that negative vibes.

41:19.100 --> 41:24.500
>> KHLOE: Why have you been
avoiding me?

41:24.500 --> 41:27.500
>> KIM: I mean, I've just been
laying low.

41:27.500 --> 41:31.333
You called me a disloyal person.
I'm just, like, over it 'cause

41:31.333 --> 41:34.934
I'm not.
>> KHLOE: I feel super bad about

41:34.934 --> 41:37.367
it and I don't want to react
that way to you.

41:37.367 --> 41:40.900
But then I'm embarrassed, and,
like, it's disturbing how I

41:40.900 --> 41:42.967
respond to you.
And I just feel like it stems

41:42.967 --> 41:45.633
from years and years of you not
believing me.

41:45.633 --> 41:48.767
And I get when I was 16 I used
to, like, exaggerate and tell

41:48.767 --> 41:51.500
stories, but that was, like,
when I was 16.

41:51.500 --> 41:53.967
I have, like... I have come so
far with you.

41:53.967 --> 41:56.467
Like, I've been pretty, like...
When it comes to straight-up

41:56.467 --> 41:59.700
facts, I've been pretty, like,
loyal and honest or whatever.

41:59.700 --> 42:03.166
So I don't know, but it doesn't
matter if you believe me or not.

42:03.166 --> 42:06.567
I need to know, like, it's my
truth and I am... I am saying

42:06.567 --> 42:09.433
the truth, so why do I get so
annoyed with you?

42:09.433 --> 42:10.800
And I don't know.
>> KIM: I don't know.

42:10.800 --> 42:15.100
I don't even know why I don't
believe you half the time.

42:15.100 --> 42:18.333
Like, you've never, you haven't
given me a reason in so long to

42:18.333 --> 42:20.266
not believe you.
>> KHLOE: Then, I don't know.

42:20.266 --> 42:22.700
>> KIM: So I don't know why
that's, like, my thing with you.

42:22.700 --> 42:25.700
>> KHLOE: But I... honestly,
just by you saying that, that

42:25.700 --> 42:28.367
means so much and, like, I
appreciate that, like, even just

42:28.367 --> 42:31.467
that you're acknowledging that.
That really means a lot.

42:31.467 --> 42:34.500
And I'm just really sorry for my
short temper with you and I'm

42:34.500 --> 42:36.600
working on it.
I'm trying to better myself and

42:36.600 --> 42:38.934
just... You know, I shouldn't
react that way.

42:38.934 --> 42:41.567
So, I love you and I'm sorry.
>> KIM: I love you, too, and I'm

42:41.567 --> 42:44.533
sorry if I doubted you.
I do get why Khloe gets so

42:44.533 --> 42:47.233
upset 'cause if someone didn't
believe you all the time, that

42:47.233 --> 42:50.600
would be so frustrating.
I can be pretty critical,

42:50.600 --> 42:54.100
especially with my sisters, so I
definitely want to, like, try to

42:54.100 --> 42:59.500
reprogram, try to figure out how
to be more open and accepting

42:59.500 --> 43:04.300
and just believing in her.
>> KHLOE: I say we both try to

43:04.300 --> 43:07.500
make a conscious effort to,
like, I won't go off on you like

43:07.500 --> 43:10.266
that and you just try to give
me the benefit of the doubt.

43:10.266 --> 43:14.333
>> KIM: Okay. Deal.
>> KHLOE: Sounds like a plan.

43:14.333 --> 43:16.767
>> KIM: On the next episode...
You're going on a trip?

43:16.767 --> 43:18.500
>> KOURTNEY: To Egypt.
>> KHLOE: With your kid?

43:18.500 --> 43:22.066
>> KOURTNEY: No. It is hard to
balance being in a relationship,

43:22.066 --> 43:25.567
work and my children.
>> KHLOE: This is your friend

43:25.567 --> 43:27.934
Pierre.
You guys are so cute.

43:27.934 --> 43:29.800
>> KRIS: I really have to pee.

43:29.800 --> 43:31.967
You are gonna be in so much
trouble. Get down.

43:31.967 --> 43:34.000
>> KHLOE: There's no way Rob and
Chyna are gonna get back

43:34.000 --> 43:35.667
together.
The legal battle that has been

43:35.667 --> 43:37.934
going on between the two of them
is escalating.

43:37.934 --> 43:41.100
>> KRIS: What's going on?
Ah, .
