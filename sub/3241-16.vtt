23:20.920 --> 23:22.001
Extraordinary!

23:24.080 --> 23:25.411
A miracle, perhaps.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.126

23:33.560 --> 23:35.005
Somehow, I don't think canon law

23:35.080 --> 23:37.845
was constructed with my situation in mind.

23:38.800 --> 23:39.926
True.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.607
But, our Lord sees the truth in all things.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.802
And so he knows your truth as well.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.408
Whatever your sins might be,

23:51.480 --> 23:53.642

24:35.880 --> 24:37.803
Stubborn. Very stubborn.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.045
He still refuses any food.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.210
You need sustenance.

24:45.320 --> 24:47.163
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

24:51.240 --> 24:52.366
He has a fever.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.491
I was afraid of that.

25:03.640 --> 25:04.880
It's looking better.

25:07.840 --> 25:08.887
Once we have you healed up,

25:09.560 --> 25:12.689
we can begin a regime
of massage and exercise,

25:12.760 --> 25:15.286
see if we can't
get that ring finger bending properly.

25:16.520 --> 25:17.726
We need to get his fever down.

25:18.520 --> 25:21.251
I'll need a bucket
of the coldest water you can find.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.525
The burn is icy in the mornings.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.724
That'll do. And also plenty of clean cloth.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.201
I'll see you get all you need.

Hey, go on.

25:48.200 --> 25:51.010
Staying sober
isna going to heal Jamie any faster, eh?

25:51.480 --> 25:53.130
It's not his wounds I'm worried about.

25:54.360 --> 25:55.361
It's the not eating.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.251

Refused to take even a mouthful of bread.

26:05.960 --> 26:06.961

26:07.680 --> 26:09.091
Starved himself to death.

There's no place safe for ye in Scotland.

Not Leoch, not Lallybroch.

Ye'll have to flee the country.

The MacKenzies know people in Paris.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.248
They can take ye in, provide shelter, eh?

31:56.920 --> 31:58.445
There are Frasers in France as well.

Jamie and I have a cousin.

He couldna fight sleep.

You need someone who can defend against...

Mistress Claire,
do you not have yer own family in France?

32:09.120 --> 32:11.646
Is that not where you were headed
when we first encountered ye?

32:12.320 --> 32:13.321
Perhaps they would take ye in?

32:13.680 --> 32:16.331
Yes, but they were
relatives of my late husband

32:16.760 --> 32:17.761
and most likely wouldn't welcome

32:17.840 --> 32:19.205
me in my current circumstances.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.161
I think Jamie would prefer to be

32:22.880 --> 32:25.770
- No offense.

34:26.719 --> 34:28.005
I wanted to tell you,

34:29.760 --> 34:31.524

I've been praying ye'd be able

34:35.760 --> 34:37.330
to talk some sense into the lad.

34:38.239 --> 34:39.241
That he'd come around.

34:39.400 --> 34:40.400
Why?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.081
Why does he want to die so badly?

34:44.560 --> 34:45.686
He's been tortured.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.081
Raped.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.364

No.

Aye.

35:25.600 --> 35:26.931

maybe the only way to save Jamie

to step into the darkness with him.

JAMIE: (MOANING)

43:51.800 --> 43:53.689
Say my name, Jamie.

43:57.560 --> 43:58.971
Say my name.

44:03.320 --> 44:04.446
Claire.

44:06.280 --> 44:07.805

44:15.040 --> 44:17.281

44:49.760 --> 44:51.125
RANDALL: I understand.

44:54.360 --> 44:56.124
How could she ever forgive you?

45:00.360 --> 45:01.361
(SOBBING)

45:05.720 --> 45:07.370
I couldna help myself, Claire.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.406
It felt

45:11.840 --> 45:13.046
so good.

45:14.560 --> 45:15.721
Not to be in pain.

45:21.720 --> 45:23.882
Were you afraid I wouldn't forgive you?

45:27.040 --> 45:29.168
There's nothing to forgive.

45:32.240 --> 45:33.526
Jamie, it's...

45:34.280 --> 45:35.406
It's all right.

45:38.920 --> 45:40.081
Don't you see?

45:45.400 --> 45:47.562
I canna be your husband any longer.

45:50.200 --> 45:52.362
And I will not be less to you.

45:52.640 --> 45:55.166
You did what was necessary to survive.
That's all.

45:55.240 --> 45:57.083
No. No, he broke me.

45:57.680 --> 45:58.841
He broke me, Claire.

45:59.920 --> 46:01.410
He knew it. We both did.

46:03.760 --> 46:05.762
You belong to no one else but me.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.290
And I belong to you.

46:09.120 --> 46:11.202
And nothing will ever change that.

46:11.280 --> 46:13.328
Those are just weak words, Claire.

46:14.880 --> 46:16.211
(GROANS)

46:19.520 --> 46:21.522
(PANTING)

46:23.240 --> 46:24.321
I lie here,

46:25.400 --> 46:27.289
feeling I will die without your touch,

46:27.360 --> 46:31.001
but when you do touch me,
I want to vomit with shame.

46:31.400 --> 46:32.401
No.

46:32.680 --> 46:34.648
You're my husband, James Fraser.

46:34.840 --> 46:36.729
How dare you give up on me now!

46:38.200 --> 46:39.201
You swore to me,

46:39.280 --> 46:40.520
you promised me

46:40.600 --> 46:43.251
the protection of your body if need be.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.130
Well, Randall had your body,

46:48.120 --> 46:50.487
but I'll be damned if he
has your soul as well.

46:51.360 --> 46:52.407
(SOBBING)

46:52.480 --> 46:53.641
You're mine.

46:56.160 --> 46:58.003
And we are meant to be together.

47:00.160 --> 47:03.369
It's the only explanation I have for all this.

47:03.440 --> 47:05.841
It's the only way I can wrap my mind around

47:05.920 --> 47:08.491
what's happened all these past months.

47:10.280 --> 47:13.284
It's all been for you and me.

47:26.280 --> 47:27.770
But if you take away

47:29.360 --> 47:31.931
the one last thing that makes sense to me,

47:37.400 --> 47:38.640
then I will die.

47:40.360 --> 47:42.044
With you, right here, now.

47:52.440 --> 47:54.647
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

47:59.520 --> 48:01.329
How can you have me like this?

48:03.200 --> 48:05.441
I will have you any way I can.

48:08.640 --> 48:09.880
Always.

- CLAIRE: The laudanum, please.
- JAMIE: No.

48:34.120 --> 48:37.203
I want to be awake

49:22.480 --> 49:23.766
Thank you, Willie.

49:26.800 --> 49:27.801
(SIGHS)

49:27.880 --> 49:29.086
You're a true friend.

49:30.240 --> 49:33.289
I doubt everyone is as sad
as you are to see us go.

49:33.680 --> 49:35.489
It's nothing personal, mistress,

49:35.640 --> 49:37.802
but keeping you and Jamie out of harm's way

49:37.880 --> 49:39.803
proves to be a full-time occupation.

49:39.880 --> 49:40.927
That's very true.

Time to go.

ANGUS: Mistress Claire?

49:49.880 --> 49:51.006

kiss you farewell?

49:54.360 --> 49:55.566
No, you may not.

49:59.240 --> 50:00.651
That is far too final.

50:01.920 --> 50:03.251
You may kiss me <i>au revoir.</i>

Apologies, mistress, I lost my head.

50:25.200 --> 50:27.965
Goodbye to you, Claire. God bless.

50:29.160 --> 50:30.286
Very gallant.

50:31.280 --> 50:33.886
See, that's how you take your leave of a lady.

51:40.120 --> 51:42.600
puking my guts out over the side

51:42.680 --> 51:45.081
and here ye are, as green as rotten fish.

51:45.240 --> 51:46.446
Please.

Fish is the last thing
I want to think about right now.

I'll see to it.

52:32.160 --> 52:33.161
Aye.

52:33.800 --> 52:35.165
I know what you mean.

52:36.080 --> 52:37.809
What are we to do in France?

52:43.520 --> 52:45.284
It won't be forever, Claire.

52:46.320 --> 52:48.243
Someday, we'll return to Scotland.

52:49.200 --> 52:50.406
That I promise ye.

52:53.600 --> 52:55.887
But you know what's
going to happen in Scotland.

52:57.960 --> 52:59.485
The Rising. Culloden.

The end of the Highland culture.

What if we could stop it from happening?

53:22.200 --> 53:24.851
The Rising, Culloden,
what if we could stop all of it?

53:26.880 --> 53:28.041
Change the future?

53:29.040 --> 53:30.201

53:30.960 --> 53:32.644
That's madness, is it not?

53:33.760 --> 53:35.091
We have to try.

53:36.800 --> 53:39.007
The Rising starts with Prince Charles.

53:40.440 --> 53:42.886
And right now,
the Bonnie Prince is in France.

Ye mean besides changing the future?

I'm not sure I'm ready to hear it.

54:19.840 --> 54:21.922
I've been wondering how to tell you this.

Murtagh assures me that

54:28.840 --> 54:29.841
once we're underway

54:29.920 --> 54:32.446
you'll be too seasick to have a conversation.

I'm pregnant.
