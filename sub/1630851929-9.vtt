00:08.967 --> 00:10.260
<i>If he wasn't your boyfriend,</i>

00:10.301 --> 00:13.179
<i>I would totally do a deep dive.</i>

00:14.180 --> 00:15.348
<i>Hey, Miles.</i>

00:15.390 --> 00:16.850
<i>I'm here to ask you</i>

00:16.891 --> 00:17.851
<i>about your encounter</i>
<i>with Jim Lindsay.</i>

00:17.892 --> 00:19.019
<i>He fucking jumped me.</i>

00:19.060 --> 00:20.145
<i>He poked me in the neck with,</i>

00:20.186 --> 00:22.022
<i>like, a needle or some shit.</i>

00:22.063 --> 00:24.315
<i>[Molly]</i> <i>I mean, I got
some really creepy vibes</i>

00:24.357 --> 00:25.692
<i>from Kurt.</i>

00:25.734 --> 00:26.901
<i>It's the kind that I tell</i>

00:26.943 --> 00:28.069
<i>my listeners to run away from</i>

00:28.111 --> 00:29.320
<i>as fast as they can.</i>

00:30.405 --> 00:32.073
<i>I think about it all the time.</i>

00:32.115 --> 00:34.159
<i>Hurting people.</i>

00:34.200 --> 00:36.745
<i>You've always known.</i>

00:37.871 --> 00:40.248
<i>That's why you left.</i>

00:40.290 --> 00:42.375
<i>When I came here,
I-I wanted answers.</i>

00:42.417 --> 00:44.002
<i>Whoa!</i>

00:44.044 --> 00:46.004
<i>[Harrison]</i> <i>I think I was
also looking for...</i>

00:46.046 --> 00:47.881
<i>Real connection with your dad.</i>

00:47.922 --> 00:49.591
<i>Whatever blood bond</i>

00:49.632 --> 00:51.676
<i>most fathers have

<i>it's...
<i>...it's not there.</i></i>

00:53.636 --> 00:55.221
<i>Where does Kurt have my son?</i>

00:55.263 --> 00:56.890
<i>Up at his cabin on Stearn Road.</i>

00:56.931 --> 00:58.433
<i>Nothing personal.</i>

01:00.060 --> 01:01.561
<i>We're talking about my son.</i>

01:01.603 --> 01:03.897
<i>There's nothing more personal</i>
<i>than that.</i>

01:03.938 --> 01:05.190
<i>Run.</i>

01:05.231 --> 01:07.233
<i>Run!</i>

01:09.277 --> 01:10.695
<i>Harrison!</i>

01:10.737 --> 01:12.238
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:12.280 --> 01:13.698
<i>There's so much</i>
<i>I need to tell you.</i>

01:13.740 --> 01:15.033
<i>I should've way before</i>

01:29.923 --> 01:31.549
<i>You have everything?</i>

01:31.591 --> 01:33.426
<i>Did you guys have fun?</i>

01:33.468 --> 01:35.470
<i>It's a scary world out there.</i>

01:45.939 --> 01:48.900
<i>Oh! Wiggles loves it!</i>

01:48.942 --> 01:50.777
<i>ominous music</i>

01:50.819 --> 01:53.571
<i>And there he is,</i>
<i>Jeremiah the giraffe,</i>

01:53.613 --> 01:56.491
<i>for the birthday girl. Mwah!</i>

01:56.533 --> 01:58.409
<i>Now, can I have everybody say,</i>

01:58.451 --> 02:00.370
<i>"Happy Birthday, Sam!"</i>

02:00.411 --> 02:02.539
<i>Happy Birthday, Sam!</i>

02:02.580 --> 02:04.415
<i>Oh, and let me get a picture</i>

02:04.457 --> 02:05.583
<i>of the birthday girl.</i>

02:07.001 --> 02:09.295
<i>
<i>-Okay.</i></i>

02:09.337 --> 02:10.713
<i>And all of you...</i>

02:10.755 --> 02:13.550
<i>Murderers. Rapists. Predators.</i>

02:16.469 --> 02:18.304
<i>Monsters who walk among us,</i>

<i>and we never even know.</i>

02:20.849 --> 02:24.144
<i>Counting on the justice system

02:24.185 --> 02:26.312
<i>and effectively deal with them</i>

02:26.354 --> 02:28.314
<i>is not an option.</i>

02:31.276 --> 02:32.944
<i>Not for me.</i>

02:59.095 --> 03:01.723
<i>I don't follow society's rules.</i>

03:07.896 --> 03:09.689
<i>But that doesn't mean
there aren't rules</i>

03:09.731 --> 03:12.567
<i>I have to follow
when the Dark Passenger calls.</i>

03:15.737 --> 03:17.322
<i>Wait.</i>

03:17.363 --> 03:20.533
<i>What-What's the Dark Passenger?</i>

03:20.575 --> 03:23.161
<i>It's the name I gave the...</i>

03:23.203 --> 03:25.371
<i>-calling that I have.</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

03:26.581 --> 03:28.708
<i>Careful.</i>

03:30.168 --> 03:32.170
<i>Always there,</i>

03:32.212 --> 03:35.215
<i>riding alongside me.</i>

03:35.256 --> 03:36.466
<i>Giving me...</i>

03:36.507 --> 03:38.718
<i>A lot of bad ideas.</i>

03:55.777 --> 03:57.820
<i>Sometimes...</i>

04:00.490 --> 04:02.700
<i>...I have the urge</i>
<i>to hurt people.</i>

04:04.869 --> 04:07.247
<i>An urge too strong to ignore.</i>

04:09.666 --> 04:11.751
<i>The Dark Passenger.</i>

04:15.213 --> 04:16.464
<i>That sounds right.</i>

04:19.968 --> 04:21.511
<i>W-Why...</i>

04:22.971 --> 04:25.098
<i>...why-why are we like this?</i>

04:28.476 --> 04:31.104
<i>We both saw our mothers murdered</i>

04:31.145 --> 04:33.189
<i>when we were young.</i>

04:41.990 --> 04:43.616
<i>You, too?</i>

04:48.997 --> 04:52.041
<i>I-I've always felt so alone.</i>

04:53.501 --> 04:57.797
<i>I thought no one</i>
<i>could understand me.</i>

04:57.839 --> 04:59.841
<i>I-I mean, if I, if I</i>

04:59.882 --> 05:01.801
<i>talked about this shit</i>
<i>with anyone...</i>

05:01.843 --> 05:03.344
<i>They'd lock you up.</i>

05:07.181 --> 05:09.017
<i>When your grandfather Harry</i>

05:09.058 --> 05:12.270
<i>found out what I was...</i>

05:12.312 --> 05:15.106
<i>I thought he'd send me</i>
<i>to an institution.</i>

05:17.608 --> 05:21.070
<i>But instead...</i>

05:21.112 --> 05:23.281
<i>he gave me the Code.</i>

05:24.866 --> 05:26.617
<i>It's a rigid process.</i>

05:28.453 --> 05:30.496
<i>Once someone is identified
as worthy of the Code,</i>

05:30.538 --> 05:33.833
<i>100% proof of their crimes
must be found.</i>

05:34.834 --> 05:37.587
<i>gentle, dramatic music</i>

06:07.241 --> 06:09.744
<i>It's not always easy to find.</i>

06:15.750 --> 06:18.878
<i>Secrets are secret for a reason.</i>

06:34.685 --> 06:38.231
<i>As a cop, Harry saw too many</i>
<i>criminals get arrested</i>

06:38.272 --> 06:39.565
<i>and escape the law.</i>

06:39.607 --> 06:42.151
<i>Then hurt innocent people</i>
<i>over and over.</i>

06:42.193 --> 06:44.570
<i>He taught me how to make sure</i>

06:44.612 --> 06:46.406
<i>they never hurt anyone</i>
<i>ever again.</i>

06:46.447 --> 06:47.740
<i>So...</i>

06:47.782 --> 06:49.992
<i>when did your dad</i>
<i>decide to teach you</i>

06:50.034 --> 06:53.246
<i>this Code?</i>

06:53.287 --> 06:54.747
<i>I was about your age</i>

06:54.789 --> 06:57.834
<i>when I started exhibiting</i>
<i>violent tendencies.</i>

06:57.875 --> 07:00.753
<i>Harry kept it a secret</i>
<i>from the rest of the family.</i>

07:00.795 --> 07:02.380
<i>Fucking-A he did.</i>

07:02.422 --> 07:03.923
<i>Well, they would've been</i>
<i>afraid of you.</i>

07:03.965 --> 07:06.467
<i>But I would never hurt family.</i>

07:10.930 --> 07:13.182
<i>Harry gave me the Code</i>
<i>as a way to channel</i>

07:13.224 --> 07:15.726
<i>the Dark Passenger.</i>

07:15.768 --> 07:17.270
<i>To use it for good.</i>

07:18.771 --> 07:20.022
<i>F-For good?</i>

07:20.064 --> 07:22.191
<i>And a way forward in life.</i>

07:24.944 --> 07:27.029
<i>Ooh!</i>

07:32.493 --> 07:35.746
<i>You like... the caramel?</i>

07:35.788 --> 07:39.459
<i>Oh!</i>

07:39.500 --> 07:40.460
<i>Oh.</i>

07:40.501 --> 07:42.879
<i>Oh...</i>

07:47.133 --> 07:49.677
<i></i>

07:51.095 --> 07:52.638
<i>What the fuck?</i>

07:52.680 --> 07:54.765
<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>Once I have proof
of their crimes,</i>

07:54.807 --> 07:57.518
<i>the Code allows me to stop them
from hurting others.</i>

08:03.608 --> 08:06.235
<i>I do what the law failed to do.</i>

08:08.154 --> 08:09.447
<i>I fix things.</i>

08:18.414 --> 08:19.373
<i>Hello.</i>

08:24.462 --> 08:26.172
<i>You kidnapped him?</i>

08:27.924 --> 08:29.509
<i>I did.</i>

08:29.550 --> 08:31.552
<i>Wiggles was a threat.</i>
<i>He would've</i>

08:31.594 --> 08:33.179
<i>tortured and killed that kid.</i>

08:33.221 --> 08:35.348
<i>Hey. That's enough.</i>

08:35.389 --> 08:36.682
<i>Well, then what?</i>

08:38.309 --> 08:39.936
<i>So...</i>

08:39.977 --> 08:43.022
<i>I prepare a place to...</i>

08:46.400 --> 08:48.611
<i>...confront these bad people.</i>

08:48.653 --> 08:50.029
<i>gentle, dramatic music</i>

08:50.071 --> 08:52.865
<i>I have to be very neat</i>

08:52.907 --> 08:55.493
<i>because the world will never
understand what I do.</i>

08:57.995 --> 09:00.039
<i>I always show them
their victims.</i>

09:01.290 --> 09:03.292
<i>It's important
that they open their eyes</i>

09:03.334 --> 09:05.503
<i>and look at what they've done.</i>

09:06.921 --> 09:09.924
<i>You abso-fucking-lutely</i>
<i>cannot tell Harrison</i>

09:09.966 --> 09:11.634
<i>about your sick-ass ritual.</i>

09:33.364 --> 09:35.157
<i>What the hell is this?</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

09:35.199 --> 09:38.411
<i>They always say</i>
<i>some shit like that.</i>

09:38.452 --> 09:42.248
<i>Stop clowning around, Wiggles.</i>

09:42.290 --> 09:45.334
<i>You know exactly</i>
<i>what's going on.</i>

09:45.376 --> 09:47.086
<i>You...</i>

09:47.128 --> 09:50.256
<i>remember... them all.</i>

09:58.973 --> 10:02.268
<i>You tell Harrison that you kill</i>
<i>people, there's no going back.</i>

10:04.729 --> 10:07.440
<i>So, doing that...</i>

10:07.481 --> 10:09.609
<i>confronting him...</i>

10:09.650 --> 10:11.944
<i>that-that made him stop?</i>

10:11.986 --> 10:13.446
<i>Scaring him like that?</i>

10:17.325 --> 10:18.909
<i>Fine.</i>

10:25.708 --> 10:27.335
<i>I won't tell him.</i>

10:27.376 --> 10:29.670
<i>Yes. He never hurt anyone again.</i>

10:34.800 --> 10:37.178
<i>So, you're-you're kind of like</i>
<i>Batman or something.</i>

10:39.305 --> 10:40.806
<i>I like Dark Defender.</i>

10:40.848 --> 10:42.933
<i>And that...</i>

10:42.975 --> 10:46.062
<i>that makes the Dark Passenger</i>
<i>not push so hard?</i>

10:54.320 --> 10:56.197
<i>This is a lot.</i>

10:56.238 --> 10:59.075
<i>It's not every day</i>
<i>you're nearly murdered</i>

10:59.116 --> 11:01.494
<i>and then find out this.</i>

11:01.535 --> 11:04.664
<i>Is Kurt gonna come after us?</i>

11:04.705 --> 11:07.667
<i>If I were him,</i>
<i>I'd be 500 miles away by now.</i>

11:15.633 --> 11:17.551
<i>It's getting late.</i>
<i>You should get some sleep.</i>

11:21.013 --> 11:22.515
<i>Okay.</i>

11:24.517 --> 11:25.935
<i>Good night, Dad.</i>

11:25.976 --> 11:28.354
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

11:28.396 --> 11:30.648
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

11:30.690 --> 11:32.441
<i>You, too.</i>

11:35.736 --> 11:37.988
<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>I still have

12:34.420 --> 12:36.464
<i>And when he asks, I'll answer.</i>

12:36.505 --> 12:38.758
<i>You ever think about</i>
<i>how screwed up it is</i>

12:38.799 --> 12:41.302
<i>you watched your mom get chopped</i>

<i>and now you do the same shit</i>

12:43.971 --> 12:45.306
<i>And Harrison dealt</i>
<i>with his trauma</i>

12:45.347 --> 12:47.266
<i>by arming himself</i>
<i>with a straight razor,</i>

<i>It is Christmas.</i>

14:21.569 --> 14:23.529
<i>Harrison seems to be all right.</i>

14:23.571 --> 14:27.032
<i>Maybe the truth

14:36.083 --> 14:38.961
<i>-Is that for me, too?</i>
<i>-Only one way to find out.</i>

14:51.974 --> 14:54.059
<i>Wow.</i>

15:00.274 --> 15:02.234

15:11.785 --> 15:13.913
<i>Do you use this when, you know,</i>

15:13.954 --> 15:16.206
<i>you know, you go after bad guys?</i>

15:16.248 --> 15:19.043
<i>No. Never. Guns are...</i>

15:19.084 --> 15:20.669
<i>loud, messy.</i>

15:20.711 --> 15:22.129
<i>Plus I'm not a very good shot.</i>

<i>This is all about blending in.</i>

15:41.732 --> 15:44.610
<i>and keep the butt up tight...</i>

15:44.652 --> 15:47.488
<i>here, like this.</i>
<i>It'll save you from bruising.</i>

15:55.663 --> 15:57.748
<i>-What is...</i>
<i>-Oh, you got to...</i>

15:57.790 --> 15:58.958
<i>take the safety off.</i>

15:58.999 --> 16:00.501
<i>-There.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

16:00.542 --> 16:02.419
<i>Like that. There you go.</i>

16:02.461 --> 16:04.964
<i>-You're ready to go.</i>
<i></i>

16:08.801 --> 16:10.970
<i>-Okay. You need to--</i>
<i>-I got it.</i>

16:21.105 --> 16:24.024
<i>Look at you.</i>

16:24.066 --> 16:25.609
<i>That's better</i>
<i>than I've ever been.</i>

16:34.368 --> 16:35.911
<i>He's a natural.</i>

16:39.707 --> 16:41.667
<i>So, I was, I was thinking</i>
<i>about Kurt last night.</i>

16:41.709 --> 16:44.169
<i>Oh?</i>

16:44.211 --> 16:47.464
<i>Was he trying to kill me because</i>
<i>you were going after him,</i>

16:47.506 --> 16:49.133
<i>like-like with Wiggles?</i>

16:55.222 --> 16:59.143
<i>Kurt has been killing innocent</i>
<i>women for the last 25 years.</i>

16:59.184 --> 17:02.187
<i>Wait, what? Wh...</i>

17:02.229 --> 17:03.731
<i>Kurt's a serial killer?</i>

17:03.772 --> 17:06.608
<i>H-How long have you known this?</i>

17:06.650 --> 17:08.027
<i>I just found out.</i>

17:08.068 --> 17:10.779
<i>Why didn't, why didn't you</i>
<i>tell Angela?</i>

17:10.821 --> 17:13.198
<i>I don't have any proof.</i>

17:13.240 --> 17:14.658
<i>Not yet.</i>

17:14.700 --> 17:17.578
<i>Plus Kurt's already</i>
<i>been arrested</i>

17:17.619 --> 17:19.121
<i>for one murder.</i>

17:19.163 --> 17:21.415
<i>-And he got away with it.</i>
<i>-Yup.</i>

17:23.751 --> 17:26.295
<i>Wh-What if I testified</i>
<i>that he tried to shoot me?</i>

17:26.336 --> 17:28.839
<i>That-That's</i>
<i>attempted murder, right?</i>

17:28.881 --> 17:31.258
<i>And then Angela starts to ask</i>
<i>a lot of questions</i>

17:31.300 --> 17:33.343
<i>about what I was doing</i>
<i>out on his property.</i>

17:33.385 --> 17:36.221
<i>Questions I can't answer.</i>

17:37.765 --> 17:38.891
<i>Vigilante shit.</i>

17:38.932 --> 17:41.351
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:41.393 --> 17:45.022
<i>Vigilante shit.</i>

17:45.064 --> 17:47.733
<i>But I do have a plan</i>

17:47.775 --> 17:50.402
<i>to make sure Kurt</i>
<i>can't hurt anyone else.</i>

17:51.904 --> 17:54.740
<i>Ask me what the plan is.</i>

17:54.782 --> 17:56.742
<i>Ask me if you can help.</i>

17:58.911 --> 18:01.080
Shit, I-I forgot.

18:01.121 --> 18:03.582
<i>I, um, I made you a gift.</i>

18:03.624 --> 18:05.584
<i>One second.</i>

18:16.095 --> 18:18.430
<i>I know it's not much.</i>

18:18.472 --> 18:21.767
<i>It's kind of how I remember her.</i>

18:27.606 --> 18:29.900
<i>Thank you. I love it.</i>

18:32.569 --> 18:34.571
<i>You got any more, uh,</i>

18:34.613 --> 18:36.281
<i>got any more bottles somewhere?</i>

18:36.323 --> 18:38.700
<i>I do, but I think</i>
<i>it's time for us</i>

18:38.742 --> 18:42.246
<i>to go exchange presents</i>
<i>with Angela and Audrey.</i>

18:42.287 --> 18:45.958
<i>Yeah. Yeah, right.</i>

18:45.999 --> 18:48.293
<i>Oh, I do have</i>
<i>one other gift for you.</i>

18:48.335 --> 18:51.880
<i>It's, uh, part of the whole...</i>

18:51.922 --> 18:53.257
<i>blending in thing.</i>

18:53.298 --> 18:55.634
<i>It's kind of a tradition</i>
<i>I've been doing.</i>

19:09.398 --> 19:11.733
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:21.034 --> 19:23.120

<i>Uh, yeah, I-I guess so.</i>

19:54.818 --> 19:56.862
<i>-Want to put these by the tree?</i>
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>

20:00.240 --> 20:01.992

<i>-to finish what he started?</i>
<i></i>

24:41.271 --> 24:42.147

<i>to remember what</i>
<i>they did to their victims.</i>

<i>jewelry, photo.</i>

25:17.307 --> 25:18.725

<i>but they can't help themselves.</i>

25:20.936 --> 25:22.896
<i>You think Kurt does that?</i>

25:22.938 --> 25:25.857
<i>And I think he keeps them</i>
<i>on his property,</i>

<i>near the cabin.</i>

26:40.098 --> 26:42.559

<i>about what I did.</i>

27:09.878 --> 27:11.338
<i>With Ethan.</i>

27:14.341 --> 27:17.844
<i>I mean, shit, I-I-I set</i>
<i>the whole thing up</i>

27:17.886 --> 27:20.472
<i>so that I could</i>
<i>get away with it.</i>

27:20.513 --> 27:22.599
<i>Maybe even look like a hero.</i>

28:13.233 --> 28:15.985
<i>I knew you were</i>
<i>hiding something.</i>

28:26.413 --> 28:28.164
<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>about Wiggles.</i>

28:28.206 --> 28:30.500
<i>About the end.</i>

28:32.961 --> 28:34.879
<i>You said you</i>

28:34.921 --> 28:37.340
<i>made sure he didn't hurt</i>
<i>anyone else again.</i>

28:38.925 --> 28:41.803
<i>I mean, scaring the shit</i>
<i>out of him,</i>

28:41.845 --> 28:44.389
<i>even hurting him.</i>

28:44.431 --> 28:48.393
<i>I mean, that-that</i>
<i>doesn't feel...</i>

28:48.435 --> 28:50.520
<i>I don't know...</i>

28:50.562 --> 28:52.605
<i>like justice.</i>

28:54.733 --> 28:57.318
<i>And what would...</i>

28:57.360 --> 29:00.405
<i>justice feel like to you?</i>

29:05.535 --> 29:08.830
<i>When I was 12 years old,</i>
<i>I started having fantasies about</i>

29:08.872 --> 29:11.708
<i>hunting down the Trinity Killer.</i>

29:11.750 --> 29:14.252
<i>You know he just</i>
<i>up and disappeared?</i>

29:17.380 --> 29:18.923
<i>I wanted to kill him.</i>

29:20.633 --> 29:22.802
<i>With his own razor.</i>

29:27.390 --> 29:29.434
<i>I wanted to do it slowly.</i>

29:38.234 --> 29:40.904
<i>I understand.</i>

29:57.921 --> 30:00.799
<i>Wait. Hold it right there.</i>

30:00.840 --> 30:04.260
<i>That's... strange.</i>

30:04.302 --> 30:06.805
<i>See that? Can you go in closer?</i>

30:09.140 --> 30:11.142
<i>That's right where</i>
<i>Kurt disappeared.</i>

30:11.184 --> 30:13.269
<i>Holy shit. That's big.</i>

30:13.311 --> 30:15.313
<i>That could be where he kills.</i>

30:15.355 --> 30:17.524
<i>Maybe where he keeps</i>
<i>his trophies.</i>

30:22.654 --> 30:24.614
<i>I-Is that a vent?</i>

30:26.324 --> 30:27.826
<i>-Let's go.</i>
<i>-Wait.</i>

30:29.494 --> 30:32.956
<i>
<i>don't get caught.</i></i>

30:32.997 --> 30:34.332
<i>We wait until dark.</i>

30:34.374 --> 30:37.210
<i>Come back tonight</i>
<i>and check it out.</i>

30:37.252 --> 30:39.170
<i>Okay.</i>

30:39.212 --> 30:41.631
<i>Outside of Harold Shipman</i>

30:41.673 --> 30:43.383
<i>or Luis Garavito,</i>

30:43.424 --> 30:45.009
<i>the Bay Harbor Butcher</i>

30:45.051 --> 30:47.011
<i>was one of the most prolific</i>

30:47.053 --> 30:50.515
<i>serial killers of all time.</i>

30:50.557 --> 30:53.518
<i>He's one of the most
sick-ass, decapitating,</i>

30:53.560 --> 30:56.354
<i>dismembering murderers
out there.</i>

30:56.396 --> 30:58.314
<i>And by the end of this podcast,</i>

30:58.356 --> 31:00.108
<i>I'm gonna challenge everything</i>

31:00.149 --> 31:01.609
<i>you may think you know about</i>

31:01.651 --> 31:04.529
<i>who... he... was.</i>

31:12.537 --> 31:13.496
<i>Hey.</i>

31:13.538 --> 31:16.040
<i>Hey, yourself.</i>

31:16.082 --> 31:17.709
<i>Look,</i>

31:17.750 --> 31:20.044
<i>I hope it doesn't bum you</i>
<i>and Audrey out too much,</i>

31:20.086 --> 31:21.963
<i>but would it be okay if</i>

31:22.005 --> 31:23.882
<i>Harrison and I don't</i>
<i>come over tonight?</i>

31:23.923 --> 31:25.842
<i>Me and the kid have been</i>
<i>really bonding.</i>

31:25.884 --> 31:27.468
<i>That's really great.</i>

31:27.510 --> 31:29.304
<i>Uh, it's no problem.</i>

31:29.345 --> 31:31.639
<i>Yeah, we're gonna go
on a night hike</i>

31:31.681 --> 31:34.434
<i>and check out that blood moon</i>
<i>that's been happening.</i>

31:34.475 --> 31:37.061
<i>That's fine. Have fun.</i>

31:37.103 --> 31:39.355
<i>Yeah. Merry Christmas. Love you.</i>

31:39.397 --> 31:42.442
<i>Merry Christmas to you, too.</i>

31:44.777 --> 31:46.696
<i>As I walk along</i>

31:46.738 --> 31:48.531
<i>I wonder</i>

31:48.573 --> 31:51.701
<i>A-what went wrong
with our love</i>

31:51.743 --> 31:55.038
<i>A love that was so strong</i>

31:56.789 --> 31:59.417
<i>And as I still walk on</i>

31:59.459 --> 32:01.252
<i>
<i>- I think of</i></i>

32:01.294 --> 32:02.629
<i>The things we've done</i>

32:02.670 --> 32:05.798
<i>Together, while our hearts</i>

32:05.840 --> 32:07.800
<i>Were young</i>

32:12.263 --> 32:14.098
<i>This is too much.</i>

32:14.140 --> 32:15.975
<i>Is it?</i>

32:19.812 --> 32:22.065
<i>He fantasized</i>
<i>about killing Trinity.</i>

32:22.106 --> 32:23.524
Who fucking didn't?

32:23.566 --> 32:25.610
<i>He admitted to wanting</i>
<i>to kill Ethan.</i>

32:25.652 --> 32:27.779
<i>-He's just like me.</i>
<i>-Then cut it short</i>

32:27.820 --> 32:29.697
<i>at finding the psycho's</i>
<i>trophies. That's enough.</i>

32:29.739 --> 32:31.366
<i>You don't have to do</i>
<i>any of this with him.</i>

32:31.407 --> 32:34.410
<i>I'm not forcing</i>
<i>any ideas on Harrison.</i>

32:34.452 --> 32:35.954
<i>I want to help him,</i>

32:35.995 --> 32:38.206
<i>just like Harry helped me.</i>

32:38.247 --> 32:41.167
<i>There were fucking</i>
<i>alternatives, Dexter.</i>

32:41.209 --> 32:44.671
<i>Therapy! Institutionalization!</i>

32:44.712 --> 32:47.131
<i>Prison might have been better</i>
<i>in the long run.</i>

32:47.173 --> 32:51.094
<i>You think prison</i>
<i>would be better?!</i>

32:51.135 --> 32:52.929
<i>Whose side are you on?</i>

32:52.971 --> 32:54.973
<i>Harrison was born in blood.</i>

32:55.014 --> 32:58.267
<i>His Dark Passenger</i>
<i>pushes him to hurt others.</i>

32:58.309 --> 33:00.478
<i>This path, it's the only way.</i>

33:04.440 --> 33:06.442
<i>And you fucking love it.</i>

33:08.236 --> 33:09.404
<i>His victims</i>

33:09.445 --> 33:10.738
<i>were usually criminals</i>

33:10.780 --> 33:12.240
<i>who'd gotten away with it.</i>

33:12.281 --> 33:15.118
<i>That's some Batman-level
vigilante shit.</i>

33:15.159 --> 33:17.453
<i>And it's why
Miami Metro Homicide</i>

33:17.495 --> 33:18.997
<i>came to believe the Butcher</i>

33:19.038 --> 33:21.416
<i>was one of their own.</i>

33:21.457 --> 33:24.335
<i>Sergeant James Doakes.</i>

33:24.377 --> 33:27.505
<i>But... what if they were wrong?</i>

33:27.547 --> 33:30.591
<i>Well, maybe the police didn't
want to keep investigating</i>

33:30.633 --> 33:33.845
<i>the biggest case
in Miami Metro history,</i>

33:33.886 --> 33:37.015
<i>but I fucking do.</i>

33:37.056 --> 33:39.350
<i>Because if I'm right,</i>

33:39.392 --> 33:42.520
<i>the Bay Harbor Butcher
could still be out there.</i>

33:42.562 --> 33:45.606
<i>Still feeling all butcher-y.</i>

33:45.648 --> 33:47.358
<i>Still a threat.</i>

33:47.400 --> 33:48.901
<i>And...</i>
<i></i>

33:48.943 --> 33:51.487
<i>Oh, my God. You freaked me out.</i>

33:51.529 --> 33:53.156
<i>-You freaked me out.</i>
<i></i>

33:53.197 --> 33:55.575
<i>-Sorry.</i>
<i>-Ooh,</i> <i>Merry Fucking Kill.</i>

33:55.616 --> 33:57.827
<i>BHB. Bad guy killer.</i>

33:57.869 --> 33:59.704
<i>Chops them up,</i>
<i>dumps them in the ocean.</i>

33:59.746 --> 34:01.330
<i>What do you think?</i>
<i>Did they get the wrong guy?</i>

34:01.372 --> 34:02.874
<i>I don't know.</i>

34:02.915 --> 34:04.542
<i>But if she's right,</i>

34:04.584 --> 34:06.961
<i>I'd be scared shitless</i>
<i>to put it out there so publicly.</i>

34:07.003 --> 34:09.672
<i>She certainly is brave.</i>

34:09.714 --> 34:11.257
<i>Times like this,</i>
<i>I'm glad we live in the sticks,</i>

34:11.299 --> 34:12.759
<i>away from monsters like that.</i>

34:12.800 --> 34:15.053
<i>
<i>- Gonoohgwa',</i> <i>Mom.</i></i>

34:15.094 --> 34:18.139
<i>
<i>-I love you, too, sweetheart.</i></i>

34:18.181 --> 34:19.932
<i>Sleep tight.</i>

34:32.945 --> 34:34.697
<i>Hi, hi. You've reached</i>

<i>Merry Christmas, Jimbo.</i>

35:15.363 --> 35:17.865

<i>There's-there's definitely</i>

<i>Come see.</i>

41:14.638 --> 41:16.974
<i>Please don't.</i>

42:13.239 --> 42:16.700
<i>Well, no, but luggage was gone.</i>

42:16.742 --> 42:18.369
<i>Room key on the bed,</i>

<i>You know the concept</i>

43:51.211 --> 43:53.130
<i>Well, it's all the more</i>

43:53.172 --> 43:57.343
<i>A single drop of blood, a single</i>

46:03.802 --> 46:07.055
<i>Really?</i>
<i>You-you fucking murdered women.</i>

46:07.097 --> 46:10.601
<i>No! I saved 'em.</i>

46:12.019 --> 46:13.771

<i>what my dad would do to them.</i>

46:23.071 --> 46:25.991
<i>Hey! I told you no dad shit.</i>

46:30.204 --> 46:32.289
<i>I'd pick them up on the road,</i>

<i>and I'd take 'em to my cabin,</i>

<i>And safety.</i>

46:42.591 --> 46:44.927
<i>They always wanted</i>
<i>to go back out there.</i>

46:44.968 --> 46:48.305
<i>And so I preserved them,</i>

46:48.347 --> 46:51.308
<i>kept them safe forever.</i>

46:52.309 --> 46:53.852
<i>Bullshit.</i>

46:55.187 --> 46:56.647
<i>This wasn't</i>
<i>about saving anyone,</i>

46:56.688 --> 46:58.732
<i>this was about power.</i>

47:00.526 --> 47:04.655
<i>You loved the power</i>
<i>you had over them.</i>

47:04.696 --> 47:09.117
<i>It fed the darkness inside you.</i>

47:09.159 --> 47:12.454
<i>You loved</i>
<i>the hunt, the capture.</i>

47:12.496 --> 47:16.333
<i>Their terror feeding you.</i>

47:18.669 --> 47:20.671
<i>You deserve to die.</i>

47:20.712 --> 47:24.508
<i>Oh, wow, Jimbo.</i>

47:24.550 --> 47:27.970
<i>You really get me,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

47:29.972 --> 47:31.557
<i>So what is this?</i>

47:31.598 --> 47:34.476
<i>You and your son, you're</i>
<i>some kind of vigilante team?</i>

47:35.936 --> 47:38.522
<i>No, don't get me wrong.</i>
<i>I'm kinda jealous.</i>

47:38.564 --> 47:42.276
<i>All the time that</i>
<i>I spent with Harrison.</i>

47:42.317 --> 47:47.823
<i>Kinda made me wish</i>
<i>my son was more like H here.</i>

47:47.865 --> 47:49.449
<i>Yeah, then why'd you try</i>
<i>to kill me?</i>

47:51.910 --> 47:55.497
<i>Oh, shit. He doesn't know.</i>

47:55.539 --> 47:58.709
<i>He doesn't know what</i>
<i>you did to Matt, does he?</i>

48:00.878 --> 48:04.673
<i>Revenge... for your dear old dad</i>
<i>murdering my son.</i>

48:04.715 --> 48:07.259
<i>Eye for an eye.</i>
<i>Son for a son.</i>

48:07.301 --> 48:09.928
<i>Nothing personal, kid.</i>

48:09.970 --> 48:11.597
<i>Matt fit The Code.</i>

48:11.638 --> 48:13.557
<i>Five people died</i>
<i>because of him.</i>

48:13.599 --> 48:15.934
<i>And they didn't</i>
<i>receive justice</i>

48:15.976 --> 48:18.020
<i>because Kurt</i>
<i>covered for him.</i>

48:18.061 --> 48:20.480
<i>Wait. What?</i>

48:20.522 --> 48:23.817
<i>That's your rationale</i>
<i>for killing people?</i>

48:23.859 --> 48:27.070
<i>Some kind of bullshit</i>
<i>justice code?</i>

48:36.455 --> 48:38.749
<i>You know, When Matt was</i>
<i>on my table,</i>

48:38.790 --> 48:41.251
<i>he blamed you for everything.</i>

48:41.293 --> 48:45.797
<i>Just like you blame your dad.</i>

48:45.839 --> 48:47.799
<i>Like father, like son.</i>

48:51.637 --> 48:53.972
<i>You don't have to watch.</i>

48:56.475 --> 48:57.935
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

49:23.710 --> 49:25.462
<i>You okay?</i>

49:27.756 --> 49:29.216
<i>I think so.</i>

49:29.257 --> 49:33.011
<i>If you need to</i>
<i>head up and get some air...</i>

49:39.643 --> 49:43.146
<i>'Cause my work isn't done here.</i>
<i>He has to be disposed of.</i>

49:45.691 --> 49:47.859
<i>I'm ready.</i>

49:57.995 --> 50:00.872
<i>Can you get the garbage bags?</i>

50:13.677 --> 50:17.097
<i>I generally cut them</i>
<i>into nine pieces,</i>

50:17.139 --> 50:19.266
<i>depending on how big they are,</i>

50:19.307 --> 50:21.184
<i>for ease of transport.</i>

50:22.728 --> 50:24.688
<i>eerie synthesizer music</i>

51:11.610 --> 51:13.236
<i>You all right?</i>

51:13.278 --> 51:14.738
<i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

51:14.780 --> 51:18.241
<i>Um, I'm gonna go get some air,</i>
<i>like you said.</i>

52:07.165 --> 52:08.291
<i>Hey.</i>

52:10.210 --> 52:12.129
<i>You put these bags</i>
<i>in the back of the RTV?</i>

52:29.855 --> 52:32.315
<i>What happens when people</i>
<i>notice he's missing?</i>

52:32.357 --> 52:35.569
<i>Well, he covered that for us</i>
<i>when he rushed home to escape.</i>

52:35.610 --> 52:40.240
<i>Angela'll look to his place</i>
<i>and see that he ransacked it,</i>

52:40.282 --> 52:43.827
<i>packed his bags, grabbed all</i>
<i>his money from the safe.</i>

52:43.869 --> 52:45.996
<i>You knew he'd run.</i>

52:46.037 --> 52:49.457
<i>Everyone here in Iron Lake</i>
<i>will think he fled.</i>

52:49.499 --> 52:52.460
<i>People run away</i>
<i>from their lives all the time.</i>

52:55.672 --> 52:57.716
<i>No more women kidnapped</i>
<i>and killed.</i>

52:57.757 --> 52:58.842
<i>That's right.</i>

53:01.344 --> 53:03.305
<i>And the Dark Passenger?</i>

53:05.765 --> 53:08.185
<i>Is quiet.</i>

53:09.394 --> 53:11.897
<i>That's how it works.</i>

53:11.938 --> 53:14.024
<i>That's how we keep it</i>
<i>under control.</i>

53:18.737 --> 53:20.906
<i>And the world's</i>
<i>a better place for it.</i>

53:22.574 --> 53:24.868
<i>That's the idea.</i>

53:28.997 --> 53:31.249
<i>Let's go home.</i>

53:41.551 --> 53:43.303
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

53:43.345 --> 53:44.596
<i>Is that smoke?</i>

54:05.408 --> 54:06.743
<i>Harrison.</i>

54:06.785 --> 54:09.829
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

54:09.871 --> 54:12.582
<i>I thought you were dead.</i>

54:15.919 --> 54:19.214
<i>Where were you?</i>

54:19.256 --> 54:23.969
<i>Like I said, I took Harrison</i>
<i>out to see the blood moon.</i>

54:24.010 --> 54:25.387
<i>What the hell happened here?</i>

54:25.428 --> 54:28.014
<i>Well, I was hoping</i>
<i>you could tell us.</i>

54:28.056 --> 54:31.226
<i>It's Kurt's parting shot.</i>

54:31.268 --> 54:34.521
<i>I kept calling you.</i>
<i>Why didn't you answer?</i>

54:34.562 --> 54:36.189
<i>I turned my phone off.</i>

54:36.231 --> 54:38.900
<i>I'm trying to stay present</i>
<i>for Harrison, you know?</i>

54:38.942 --> 54:41.194
<i>What time did you leave?</i>

54:41.236 --> 54:43.029
<i>It was around 10 p.m.</i>

54:43.071 --> 54:46.616
<i>We took the RTV out,</i>
<i>had a great night.</i>

54:46.658 --> 54:48.743
<i>Just lost track of time,</i>
<i>I guess.</i>

54:48.785 --> 54:51.037
<i>They have to stay with us.</i>

54:51.079 --> 54:53.206
<i>What?</i>

54:53.248 --> 54:54.958
<i>It's okay.</i>
<i>We can stay at the inn.</i>

54:55.000 --> 54:58.169
<i>Mom, they can stay</i>
<i>with us, right?</i>

55:17.605 --> 55:18.898
<i>Bet you're starving.</i>

55:18.940 --> 55:20.859
<i>Yep.</i>
<i>-Me, too.</i>

55:20.900 --> 55:22.610
<i>I was thinking eggs and bacon?</i>

55:22.652 --> 55:24.779
<i>Maybe some of those</i>
<i>frozen hash browns?</i>

55:24.821 --> 55:27.699
<i>And a damn fine cup of coffee.</i>

55:34.873 --> 55:37.667
<i>I should probably help</i>
<i>the kids in the kitchen.</i>

55:37.709 --> 55:39.919
<i>Breakfast wizard.</i>

55:39.961 --> 55:44.174
<i></i>

56:05.570 --> 56:07.655
<i>haunting piano music</i>

56:09.282 --> 56:11.368
<i></i>
<i></i>

56:20.919 --> 56:23.505
<i>mysterious music</i>
