<i>You don't have to be
a prisoner of depression.</i>

00:06.435 --> 00:08.529
<i>Unlock the door
of darkness and despair...</i>

00:08.740 --> 00:11.335
<i>... and step into the sunlight
with Lumitrol.</i>

00:11.510 --> 00:14.640
<i>If you're taking an MAO inhibitor,
consult your physician.</i>

00:15.149 --> 00:16.242
<i>- Tremors, nausea...</i>

00:16.418 --> 00:17.886
You should try that stuff.

00:18.054 --> 00:19.989
What for? I'm not depressed.

00:20.157 --> 00:24.528
- Really? Why not?
- What have I got to be depressed about?

00:24.697 --> 00:27.395
You've been divorced twice,
you live on your brother's couch...

00:27.569 --> 00:30.164
...and your only child
is flunking tenth grade.

00:31.308 --> 00:33.834
You're flunking tenth grade?
When did this happen?

00:34.011 --> 00:36.743
Easy, dude. I think you got
bigger things to worry about.

00:38.786 --> 00:40.721
Charlie, you're being an ass about this.

00:40.889 --> 00:42.482
I said no. End of discussion.

00:42.658 --> 00:44.456
Yeah, that'll do it.

00:44.628 --> 00:48.259
It's a couple dance lessons so we
don't look like idiots at our wedding.

00:48.434 --> 00:51.769
I've said yes to everything
having to do with this stupid wedding...

00:51.939 --> 00:53.134
...but this is too much.

00:53.308 --> 00:56.905
- You think our wedding is stupid?
- Lf I have to dance it is.

00:57.081 --> 00:59.414
You know what, just drop dead.

00:59.584 --> 01:03.522
Fine, I'll drop dead
and you can dance on my grave.

01:18.213 --> 01:22.208
You do know you're going to be taking
dancing lessons?

01:22.387 --> 01:24.253
Oh, yeah.

01:24.423 --> 01:26.187
Does that depress you?

01:26.359 --> 01:30.354
- A little.
- May I suggest you try Lumitrol.

01:32.001 --> 01:34.562
- What?
- Unless you're taking an MAO inhibitor.

01:34.738 --> 01:37.436
In which case, consult your physician.

01:37.610 --> 01:41.343
Hard to believe
he's flunking tenth grade.

02:13.298 --> 02:15.062
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:15.234 --> 02:17.396
Did you cave on the dancing?

02:17.905 --> 02:20.067
- Yeah.
- You have to grovel?

02:21.310 --> 02:24.076
Like a leper at a kissing booth.

02:24.515 --> 02:26.108
Did you at least get make-up sex?

02:26.284 --> 02:29.585
- Nope.
- Wow, it's like you're already married.

02:30.491 --> 02:32.518
I might as well give her my testicles...

02:32.695 --> 02:35.062
...and use the empty sack
as a man purse.

02:35.232 --> 02:39.796
Hey, hey, don't knock the man purse.
Terrific way to carry your keys...

02:39.973 --> 02:43.410
...ChapStick, sunblock, moist wipes.

02:44.012 --> 02:45.480
Please move out of my house.

02:45.915 --> 02:50.981
Hey, face it, big brother, we're a team.
Like Ernest and Julio Gallo.

02:51.957 --> 02:55.861
Seriously, get some cardboard boxes,
fill them with your crap and go.

02:56.030 --> 02:59.024
See, that's just misdirected anger.
You're not mad at me...

02:59.202 --> 03:02.537
...you're mad at yourself for trading
your dignity and self-respect...

03:02.707 --> 03:04.938
...for security,
peace of mind and regular sex.

03:05.111 --> 03:06.545
Where do you get that?

03:06.713 --> 03:08.306
I've been married twice, Julio.

03:10.553 --> 03:13.683
The key is to make the best of it.
Like the dance lessons.

03:13.858 --> 03:17.421
They can be fun.
You and Chelsea practicing...

03:17.630 --> 03:21.329
...learning to glide across
the dance floor as a single organism...

03:21.503 --> 03:24.303
...embracing the music
like the breath of life itself.

03:25.209 --> 03:29.147
Okay, first decorate my house
then move out.

03:29.315 --> 03:31.284
Cute.
You'll see on your wedding day...

03:31.451 --> 03:34.547
...when you step out onto
the dance floor with your new bride...

03:34.723 --> 03:37.523
...and sweep her into your arms
with everybody watching.

03:38.095 --> 03:41.589
- Sorry, I can't see it.
- Let me help you.

03:41.767 --> 03:44.966
<i>Precious and few
Are the moments</i>

03:45.140 --> 03:51.343
<i>We two can share</i>

03:52.417 --> 03:54.716
How'd you know
that's the song she wants?

03:54.888 --> 03:57.586
Who do you think suggested it to her?

03:57.759 --> 04:01.390
Okay. Let's see what you got.

04:02.099 --> 04:03.897
- What?
- Dance with me. Come on.

04:04.569 --> 04:06.470
Are you out of your mind?

04:06.640 --> 04:10.373
- I'm just gonna give you a few tips.
- Keep your tip away from me.

04:10.546 --> 04:12.174
You can embarrass yourself now...

04:12.348 --> 04:14.840
...or embarrass yourself
at your first dance class...

04:15.019 --> 04:17.351
...in front of Chelsea
and a bunch of strangers.

04:21.762 --> 04:25.030
Okay, I just want you to know
I'm only letting you touch me...

04:25.235 --> 04:27.534
...because I'm half in the bag.

04:27.738 --> 04:30.675
Boy, if I had a nickel
for every time I heard that.

04:31.778 --> 04:34.715
Now, put your right hand
on my lower back.

04:34.883 --> 04:37.910
- And your left hand holds my right hand.
- Okay.

04:38.088 --> 04:41.217
Whoa, whoa. We're not cracking walnuts.

04:41.392 --> 04:43.862
Firmly but gently,
like you hold a baby bird.

04:44.030 --> 04:45.430
I've never held a baby bird.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.965
Okay, like you hold a boob.

04:47.536 --> 04:50.301
- I am holding a boob.
- Ha, ha.

04:50.473 --> 04:53.467
We start with a simple waltz.
You're the boy, I'm the girl.

04:53.645 --> 04:55.841
That's how it'd break down in prison.

04:56.015 --> 04:58.986
I don't know, Charlie,
you've always been the pretty one.

04:59.153 --> 05:03.251
And one, two, three,
two, two, three...

05:03.426 --> 05:05.919
...one, two, three, two, two, three.

05:06.098 --> 05:08.158
Okay, you have to back off a half step.

05:08.334 --> 05:11.169
There's no groin contact
in ballroom dancing.

05:12.407 --> 05:15.310
I wonder if that's why
they call it "ball room."

05:17.949 --> 05:21.250
Man, your grandmother really did
a number on those poor bastards.

05:24.126 --> 05:26.891
It's a miracle I turned out
as well as I did.

05:47.561 --> 05:50.088
Hey, Uncle Charlie,
wanna dance with me?

05:50.266 --> 05:52.997
Hey, Jake,
wanna live in a foster home?

05:53.170 --> 05:55.105
Sometimes.

05:55.273 --> 05:58.142
Don't sass me, boy.
I'll take the switch to you.

06:00.514 --> 06:01.982
Hello, man of my dreams.

06:02.150 --> 06:03.948
Hello, love of my life.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.816
Hello, reason I go to therapy.

06:05.989 --> 06:08.551
You go to therapy
because you're weak.

06:08.728 --> 06:11.220
I'm weak because you broke my spirit
at age 5.

06:11.398 --> 06:13.128
Oh, boo-hoo for you.

06:13.301 --> 06:15.497
Guys, guys,
can we please not do this?

06:15.671 --> 06:18.164
- What?
- Just saying hello.

06:19.511 --> 06:22.140
I'm gonna go put this stuff away.
Thanks for the scarf.

06:22.582 --> 06:25.644
My pleasure, dear.
It looks beautiful on you.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.652
Thank you.

06:27.823 --> 06:30.658
- That woman is just a treasure.
- I know.

06:30.828 --> 06:32.820
- Worth her weight in gold.
- Yes, she is.

06:32.998 --> 06:36.231
Speaking of which, have you
talked to her about a prenup?

06:36.437 --> 06:38.929
What? No, I'm not gonna ask her
for a prenup.

06:39.107 --> 06:42.875
Charles, 50 percent of all marriages
end in divorce.

06:43.046 --> 06:46.950
And guess which half the guys
who can't keep it in their pants fall into?

06:47.120 --> 06:49.681
Hey, I have never once cheated
on Chelsea.

06:49.857 --> 06:52.692
- How long have you known her?
- About a year and a half.

06:52.862 --> 06:55.195
How long do you plan on
being married?

06:56.768 --> 06:59.397
Criminy, I need a prenup.

07:03.813 --> 07:06.783
And one, two, three, one, two, three.

07:06.983 --> 07:10.443
Very nice, two, three.

07:10.622 --> 07:13.559
You're doing great, sweetie.
Have you been practicing?

07:13.727 --> 07:17.722
No, no. No. I'm a musician.
It's instinctive.

07:18.869 --> 07:21.464
So the pictures Jake e-mailed me
of you and Alan...

07:21.639 --> 07:25.202
...was just what,
a tender moment between brothers?

07:27.381 --> 07:31.046
How old do kids have to be
before it's legal to punch them?

07:31.221 --> 07:34.090
Oh, come on, you'd never hit Jake.

07:34.259 --> 07:37.924
That's exactly what I want you to tell
Child Services.

07:38.432 --> 07:41.267
I think it's great you cared
enough about this to practice.

07:41.437 --> 07:43.201
So I get some points in the bank?

07:43.373 --> 07:46.105
- Whole bunch.
- Good, good.

07:46.278 --> 07:49.305
Hey, speaking of banks...

07:49.482 --> 07:52.248
...l've been thinking.
Now don't overreact...

07:52.420 --> 07:57.656
...but maybe we should talk about
the possibility of getting some kind of a...

07:57.829 --> 07:59.821
What do you call them? ...prenup.

08:01.434 --> 08:03.630
Sure. Want your lawyer
to draw it up or mine?

08:03.804 --> 08:07.333
Now switch partners
with the couple to your left.

08:10.849 --> 08:13.911
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:14.087 --> 08:16.522
- Are you two getting married?
- Yeah.

08:16.691 --> 08:21.859
That's wonderful. It took me 38 years
to get my husband to dance with me.

08:22.333 --> 08:23.824
Well, better late than never.

08:24.002 --> 08:27.269
He's doing it now because I caught
him banging our church organist.

08:30.513 --> 08:32.708
Oh.

08:32.883 --> 08:36.787
Wanna help a nice lady
give a little payback?

08:37.857 --> 08:39.017
Switch!

08:41.530 --> 08:42.690
Hi. Missed you.

08:42.864 --> 08:44.355
Me too.

08:44.534 --> 08:47.528
So you were saying you're okay
with the prenup thing?

08:47.706 --> 08:50.369
Yeah. I was trying to figure
out a way to bring it up.

08:50.543 --> 08:52.672
Really? Why were you
gonna bring it up?

08:52.847 --> 08:56.717
Well, I just think it's smart for both
of us to protect our property.

08:56.886 --> 08:58.650
What property do you have?

08:59.390 --> 09:01.518
Not a lot. Just a little real estate.

09:02.295 --> 09:03.523
Real estate?

09:03.697 --> 09:06.223
No big deal.
Just a few apartment buildings.

09:06.401 --> 09:08.700
- Buildings?
And switch.

09:09.573 --> 09:11.906
Keep walking, pal.

09:12.076 --> 09:14.842
When were you planning on telling me
you own buildings?

09:15.448 --> 09:17.280
I didn't think it was that important.

09:17.451 --> 09:19.682
It's important enough for you
to want a prenup.

09:19.855 --> 09:23.384
- You're the one who brought it up.
- But I'm not hiding anything from you.

09:23.560 --> 09:26.429
You know everything I've got.
A house on the beach...

09:26.599 --> 09:30.628
...a car in the garage and
a worthless douche in my guest room.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.105
What about all the royalties
from your music?

09:34.277 --> 09:37.271
Yeah, well, you've got buildings.

09:38.283 --> 09:39.444
Just three.

09:40.119 --> 09:42.988
- Just three?
- Why are you getting so upset?

09:43.158 --> 09:48.292
I thought I knew you. I had no idea
you had some secret life as a slumlord.

09:48.733 --> 09:49.792
I'm not a slumlord.

09:49.968 --> 09:52.335
Two are in the marina
and one's in Brentwood.

09:52.772 --> 09:55.743
- Oh, my God, that's even worse.
- Why?

09:55.911 --> 09:57.675
We've been together
almost two years.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.512
Would it have killed you to pick up
a check once in a while?

10:01.686 --> 10:03.484
Switch.

10:04.925 --> 10:06.416
Hello again.

10:14.406 --> 10:17.844
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome for the first time...</i>

10:18.011 --> 10:22.382
<i>... as husband and wife
Mr. And Mrs. Alan Harper.</i>

10:25.156 --> 10:29.288
<i>Now I've had the time of my life</i>

10:29.462 --> 10:33.525
<i>No, I never felt like this before</i>

10:33.702 --> 10:37.801
<i>Yes, I swear
It's the truth</i>

10:37.976 --> 10:40.878
<i>And I owe it all to you</i>

10:41.046 --> 10:46.885
<i>Cos I had the time of my life</i>

10:47.056 --> 10:50.026
<i>And I owe it all to you</i>

10:55.302 --> 10:57.669
Hey, how was dance lessons?

10:58.040 --> 10:59.941
You wanna know
how dance lessons were?

11:00.110 --> 11:03.878
I'll tell you how dance lessons were.
Chelsea wants a freaking prenup.

11:04.049 --> 11:06.951
Just because you dance
like a middle-aged white guy?

11:07.120 --> 11:09.283
- I am not middle-aged.
- Oh, sorry.

11:09.458 --> 11:10.926
You. You're middle-aged.

11:11.561 --> 11:12.927
I'm younger than you.

11:13.096 --> 11:17.125
You're also broke, losing your hair
and sleeping on my hide-a-bed.

11:17.303 --> 11:20.672
Always gotta bring a gun
to a knife fight, don't you?

11:22.544 --> 11:25.207
- What the hell are you watching?
- It's my wedding video.

11:25.381 --> 11:27.043
No kidding. Where am I?

11:27.218 --> 11:29.711
In the coatroom
banging Judith's sister.

11:29.889 --> 11:33.827
Oh, right. Wish you had that video.

11:34.829 --> 11:36.593
So why does Chelsea want a prenup?

11:36.766 --> 11:40.761
She's got three apartment buildings
she doesn't want me to get my hands on.

11:40.939 --> 11:43.170
Really?
Anything I could live in for free?

11:43.343 --> 11:46.746
You know, house-sit,
building manager in lieu of rent.

11:47.549 --> 11:50.349
- How did this become about you?
- Fine, I'll stay here.

11:50.521 --> 11:52.888
Oh, good, I was worried.

11:53.459 --> 11:56.452
The point is, Chelsea's been keeping
a secret from me.

11:56.630 --> 12:00.329
Maybe she wants to make sure you loved
her for herself and not her property.

12:00.502 --> 12:02.494
Oh, so I don't even get the choice?

12:03.040 --> 12:04.633
I would think you would be happy.

12:04.843 --> 12:07.278
She's well-off
and doesn't care about your money.

12:07.446 --> 12:10.315
- Which makes me trust her even less.
- What?

12:10.485 --> 12:11.817
Alan, think it through.

12:11.987 --> 12:15.618
If she's not interested in my money,
then why is she marrying me?

12:17.496 --> 12:19.465
I have no idea.

12:20.867 --> 12:26.240
Exactly. We may have to consider
the possibility that Chelsea's insane.

12:26.977 --> 12:28.969
I see your point.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.751
She look like she's sorry?

12:37.192 --> 12:40.095
Yeah. Sorry she ever met you.

12:40.798 --> 12:43.234
- Hey, Chels.
- Hello, Alan.

12:43.402 --> 12:47.204
Brr. I think my nipples just got hard.

12:48.176 --> 12:49.542
Yeah, well, too bad.

12:49.712 --> 12:52.649
She deceived me and doesn't trust
our marriage is gonna last.

12:52.817 --> 12:54.786
Aren't you the one
who wanted the prenup?

12:54.953 --> 12:56.046
- That's different.
- How?

12:56.222 --> 12:59.454
Because when I brought it up
I thought I had more stuff than her.

12:59.627 --> 13:01.152
Okay, let me get this straight.

13:01.329 --> 13:04.858
You're upset because you're marrying
a woman whose only character flaw...

13:05.035 --> 13:07.665
...is that she happens
to have her own money?

13:07.840 --> 13:10.002
I knew you wouldn't understand.

13:15.518 --> 13:17.646
<i>So we take each other's hands</i>

13:17.821 --> 13:23.319
<i>Cos we seem to understand the urgency</i>

13:23.497 --> 13:25.729
<i>Just remember</i>

13:25.901 --> 13:28.837
<i>You're the one thing</i>

13:29.005 --> 13:32.067
<i>I can't get enough of</i>

13:32.244 --> 13:35.477
That's the last time
she ever moved her pelvis like that.

13:49.403 --> 13:52.465
Are we gonna talk or are you
gonna sit there pretending to read?

13:52.642 --> 13:54.406
I'm not pretending.

13:54.578 --> 13:57.845
If I didn't know how to read,
I would've told you a long time ago.

13:59.019 --> 14:01.079
I wouldn't have deceived you.

14:01.255 --> 14:02.518
Don't be such a child.

14:03.058 --> 14:05.857
I'm the child? You're the one
who's been keeping secrets.

14:06.029 --> 14:09.968
It wasn't really a secret.
I would've told you if you'd asked.

14:11.637 --> 14:16.043
Oh, really? So it's my fault
that I didn't ask if you're a land baron?

14:17.280 --> 14:18.872
What else should I be asking you?

14:19.049 --> 14:22.680
Were you born with a penis?
Is this your home planet?

14:23.356 --> 14:25.291
- Okay, now you're being ridiculous.
- No.

14:25.459 --> 14:27.826
What I'm being is committed
to this relationship.

14:27.996 --> 14:29.225
Really? You're committed?

14:29.398 --> 14:31.765
Yes, and I've jumped through hoops
to prove it.

14:31.935 --> 14:35.168
- What hoops? Dancing lessons?
- No, not dancing lessons.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.378
Yeah, okay, dancing lessons.

14:38.579 --> 14:39.706
And meeting your mom.

14:39.882 --> 14:43.011
And being nice to your friends,
even the ones that don't like me.

14:43.187 --> 14:45.383
And letting you put
these pillows on my bed.

14:45.590 --> 14:47.456
- Did I complain about that?
- Constantly.

14:47.627 --> 14:49.858
And yet here they are.

14:50.632 --> 14:54.161
With your frilly curtains
and your girly lamps.

14:54.337 --> 14:56.966
<i>It's like living inside
the I Dream of Jeannie bottle.</i>

14:57.608 --> 15:00.511
I'm supposed to be grateful because
you've behaved the way...

15:00.680 --> 15:03.583
...a fiancé is supposed to behave
towards the woman he loves?

15:03.752 --> 15:07.918
Oh, yeah, okay, I see.
Now you're gonna turn it around on me.

15:08.125 --> 15:09.423
Make me the bad guy.

15:09.594 --> 15:12.393
- Where are you going?
- I'm sleeping on the couch.

15:12.566 --> 15:13.692
In my house.

15:13.867 --> 15:18.033
Which you know I own because
I bragged about it the first night we met.

15:23.081 --> 15:25.312
- Alan.
- What? What's wrong?

15:26.086 --> 15:27.349
Chelsea and I had a fight.

15:27.522 --> 15:29.491
I'm sorry. You wanna talk about it?

15:29.658 --> 15:32.127
I just did. Now go sleep on the couch.

15:32.796 --> 15:35.596
If you had the fight,
why do I have to sleep on the couch?

15:35.767 --> 15:38.897
You ever hear of crap rolling uphill?

15:39.306 --> 15:40.501
Get out.

15:40.675 --> 15:43.804
Just using the word "please"
would go such a long way with me.

15:43.981 --> 15:48.886
Fair enough. Please get out before
I pull your pajama bottoms up so far...

15:49.054 --> 15:51.957
...you'll be wearing your balls
as a bolo tie.

15:53.829 --> 15:55.388
There, was that so hard?

16:18.099 --> 16:20.934
I'm sorry for keeping a secret
from you.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.753
Is there any way I can make it up
to you?

16:40.767 --> 16:42.531
Okay, I would be remiss...

16:45.976 --> 16:47.569
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16:47.745 --> 16:50.409
- You let me lay naked on you.
- I didn't know it was you.

16:50.583 --> 16:53.382
I thought it was a dream.
I didn't know what to say.

16:53.554 --> 16:54.886
And you're so soft and so warm...

16:56.792 --> 16:59.159
Oh, I deserved that.

17:01.032 --> 17:04.162
- What the hell is going on in here?
- Your brother's a pervert!

17:04.337 --> 17:06.238
You woke me up to tell me that?

17:07.009 --> 17:09.444
I came down here to apologize
for keeping a secret.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.740
It was dark,
and I thought it was you...

17:11.915 --> 17:14.784
...so I laid down naked on him
and he let me.

17:14.954 --> 17:18.289
You let Chelsea lie... Wait a minute.
You came down to apologize?

17:18.893 --> 17:20.361
Yes.

17:20.529 --> 17:23.021
So you're saying I'm right
and you're wrong?

17:23.567 --> 17:24.590
Yes. You're right.

17:25.102 --> 17:27.367
Excuse me, I didn't quite get that.

17:27.540 --> 17:30.374
Do you wanna gloat or do you wanna
let me make it up to you?

17:30.544 --> 17:32.137
Make up. I choose make up.

17:32.647 --> 17:35.413
- Then come on.
- Right behind you.

17:35.719 --> 17:36.812
You sick freak.

17:44.599 --> 17:45.726
Still worth it.

17:55.883 --> 18:00.049
Eventually,
Alan's bed-wetting stopped.

18:00.223 --> 18:04.253
At least I hope it did
for the sake of the honeymoon.

18:05.198 --> 18:08.226
Unless, of course,
you're into that kind of thing.

18:11.741 --> 18:13.869
To Alan and Judith.

18:14.045 --> 18:16.014
Yeah.
Yeah.

18:18.151 --> 18:22.614
And now I'd like
to introduce the best man...

18:22.792 --> 18:26.821
...although I consider him
to be a bitter disappointment...

18:26.998 --> 18:30.094
...Alan's brother, Charlie.

18:30.270 --> 18:32.102
Charlie?

18:33.608 --> 18:35.008
Charlie?

18:35.177 --> 18:37.271
Charles.

18:37.748 --> 18:39.512
Coming.

18:46.595 --> 18:48.461
What's going on?

18:48.632 --> 18:52.798
You're making a toast
to your brother and his bride.

18:52.971 --> 18:54.906
How am I doing?

18:55.976 --> 18:57.500
Make the toast.

18:57.679 --> 18:59.271
Okay.

19:00.483 --> 19:03.886
Can I throw in a word
about the bride's sister?

19:04.055 --> 19:07.117
- No.
- Got it.

19:07.360 --> 19:12.356
Well, just FYI,
that word would've been "nasty."

19:14.505 --> 19:19.376
Don't look at me like that, Judy.
Your sister's a freak.

19:19.545 --> 19:22.072
<i>She's a super freak, super freak</i>

19:22.250 --> 19:25.551
<i>She's super freaky
Super freak, super freak</i>

19:25.722 --> 19:28.385
Unbelievable.
