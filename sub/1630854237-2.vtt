Yeah, that was my warm-up.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.938
Bishop.

01:10.971 --> 01:13.941
That Crisis One paperwork
isn't gonna file itself.

01:13.974 --> 01:16.144
Yeah, Hughes usually does
the paperwork for Crisis One.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.045
I believe the words you're
looking for are, "Yes, Captain."

01:18.078 --> 01:20.114
Yes, Captain.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.155
He's even more charming
than usual.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.492
<i>Travis Montgomery
can grandstand all he wants,</i>

01:31.525 --> 01:33.661
<i>but the truth is, the people

<i>I've been working at city hall
in one capacity</i>

01:35.829 --> 01:37.765
<i>or another for 15 years.</i>

01:37.798 --> 01:40.067
<i>Montgomery's been a non-ranking
firefighter for less than 10.</i>

01:40.100 --> 01:42.336
Dixon is so salty
that you're getting famous!

01:42.370 --> 01:44.104
I'm not getting famous.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.840
Like, five people have shared
that video from the tornado.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.076
You are Seattle famous.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.145
Embrace it, buddy.
It's gonna help you win.

01:51.179 --> 01:53.281
I don't want to win.
I just want Dixon to lose.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.682
Seriously, though,
you could win.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.084
Look, they are calling you
"Mayor Trav."

01:57.117 --> 01:59.086
Oh, okay.

01:59.119 --> 02:02.323
So I'm not even Seattle Famous,
I'm Seattle Gay-Famous.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.457
Yeah.
I'm Gaymous.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.092
Yeah, you are.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.327
Jack, I'm gonna fill up
your voicemail

02:06.360 --> 02:08.095
until you call me back.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.163
Has anyone
heard from Gibson?

02:09.197 --> 02:11.965
Look at Mayor Trav.
Look at him.

02:13.301 --> 02:15.002
Ooh! Jaunty.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.437
You know this means you need
a boyfriend, right?

02:16.470 --> 02:18.105
Theo, not in
front of Vic.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.807
Wha-- Ah, buh, buh.
Wait, wait, wait, he's right.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.442
As your campaign manager--
You're not my campaign manager.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.178
As your campaign manager,
I would be irresponsible

02:24.212 --> 02:26.347
not to tell you that
candidates poll 4% higher

02:26.380 --> 02:27.948
when they're in
a committed relationship.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.450
Even more when
they're married.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.818
I'm pretty sure that
doesn't include gay men.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.120
Ah, gay firefighter.
Big difference.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.455
That's right.
Mm. They do have a point.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.723
Yeah, I'm saying,
we could set you up.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.858
With who?
We know gay men.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.993
Other than me.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.029
Your dad?
Ohh.

02:42.062 --> 02:43.997
Is it just me,
or is Beckett, like,

02:44.031 --> 02:45.466
out for blood
with Bishop these days?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.235
Dude! Okay.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.537
I didn't want to say anything,
but I heard him tell Carina

02:49.570 --> 02:52.406
that Bishop tried blackmailing
Ross into firing him.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.641
What?
Yeah.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.676
No. That is--
Come on, stop.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.678
That's ridiculous.
Is it, though?

02:57.711 --> 03:01.549
Bishop's the most ruthless
person I know, except, well...

03:01.582 --> 03:03.083
you.

03:03.116 --> 03:05.219
What could she blackmail
Chief Ross about?

03:05.253 --> 03:07.020
Exactly. I mean,
why would she <i>need</i> to?

03:07.054 --> 03:10.391
'Cause you could fire Beckett
for literally anything.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.025
I mean, pick something.
Any reason.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.895
Maybe Ross
is a con artist

03:14.928 --> 03:16.597
and was never even
a firefighter before.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.198
Oh.
That's your opening play?
Yeah.

03:18.232 --> 03:19.867
That's a little extreme.
But you know what?
I mean...

03:19.900 --> 03:20.868
I like it, so...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.104
You know, maybe she's
an international super spy.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.005
Ooh!
I like that.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.340
Origin story.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.875
I like it.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.343
I love that. Yeah.

03:29.377 --> 03:32.246
Like a bank robber,
hiding out from the cops.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.956
It's 2022.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.058
You'd think we'd figure out how
to digitize Crisis One filings.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.928
Please tell me that
what I just heard is not true.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.430
What did you hear?

03:49.463 --> 03:52.266
That you
blackmailed Ross.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.535
Did Carina tell you that?

03:54.568 --> 03:57.438
No.
People are talking.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.039
Wait. Why would your wife
tell me that?

03:59.072 --> 04:01.475
She thinks something's
wrong with me.

04:01.509 --> 04:04.111
If you blackmailed the Chief,
then, yeah,

04:04.144 --> 04:06.113
I-I might have to agree.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.915
I just wanted
my job back.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.417
Oh, so you thought--

04:09.450 --> 04:11.218
you thought blackmail
was the way to do that, huh?

04:11.251 --> 04:14.121
Maya--
I saw an opportunity,
so I took it.

04:14.154 --> 04:15.323
What opportunity?

04:15.356 --> 04:16.757
You're already looking at me
like you think

04:16.790 --> 04:18.158
I'm scum,
so never mind.

04:18.191 --> 04:19.327
Oh. Come on. Stop it.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.295
Girl, look, it's me.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.930
I mean, whatever you tell me
stays here.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.133
People are out there,
making up stories

04:26.166 --> 04:28.235
that are probably way worse
than whatever the truth is,

04:28.268 --> 04:29.970
so you might--
I told Chief Ross

04:30.003 --> 04:32.005
that if she didn't get rid of
Beckett and reinstate me

04:32.039 --> 04:33.674
as Captain, then I would
go to the department

04:33.707 --> 04:35.809
and report her relationship
with Sullivan.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.981
Aren't they just
old friends?

04:41.014 --> 04:42.983
I think they're more than that.
Or at least they used to be.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.151
Or maybe that's
what she wanted,

04:44.184 --> 04:45.753
and that's why
she promoted him?

04:45.786 --> 04:46.954
I don't know. But it was
gross and inappropriate.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.156
We've all been gross
and inappropriate

04:49.189 --> 04:50.624
at some point
or another.

04:50.658 --> 04:53.093
But we do not
blackmail each other.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.695
I know, and it was
a stupid impulse,

04:54.728 --> 04:55.929
because I didn't
have any proof

04:55.963 --> 04:57.498
so I couldn't actually
report them,

04:57.531 --> 04:59.433
but Ross went to Beckett
and told him

04:59.467 --> 05:01.168
I tried to stab him in the back
so she could keep

05:01.201 --> 05:03.604
her nose clean and let him
punish me himself,

05:03.637 --> 05:05.506
which is actually
kind of genius,

05:05.539 --> 05:07.608
and if I didn't hate her
so much, I'd actually love her.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.043
But now Beckett has been
taking it out on me

05:10.077 --> 05:12.713
the last six months
until my wife got upset with him

05:12.746 --> 05:15.449
and confronted him about it,
and he told her what I did,

05:15.483 --> 05:18.051
and now she thinks
that I need therapy.
Wait, wait, hold up.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.221
You didn't
even tell Carina?

05:21.254 --> 05:22.356
I didn't say
it was a good plan.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.991
Okay, all right.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.193
Okay.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.195
Y-You have to promise me
one thing.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.863
Actually,
two things.

05:29.897 --> 05:33.467
One, do not tell anyone else
in this house

05:33.501 --> 05:35.002
what you just told me, okay?

05:35.035 --> 05:37.037
Do you want to go back
to when they all hated you?

05:37.070 --> 05:38.238
No.
Right, exactly.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.374
And two--

05:40.408 --> 05:43.477
<i>Engine 19,
Ladder 19, Aid Car 19</i>

05:43.511 --> 05:47.014
<i>requested at 5178
San Juan Court.</i>

05:47.047 --> 05:48.816
Aid car is wrapping up
another call.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.317
They'll meet us.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.685
Bishop, you're on
the ladder with me.
Why?

05:51.719 --> 05:53.821
'Cause I need someone
to polish my helmet.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.061
Cutler,
you're on the engine.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.730
Maybe the new chief's
a Wiccan.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.932
Maybe the Chief made
a pass at Maya.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.936
You think
she's her type?

06:08.969 --> 06:10.070
What's a Wiccan?

06:11.772 --> 06:13.774
Hey, what was
the second thing?

06:13.807 --> 06:16.710
Listen to your wife.
Get some help.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.131
Herrera, you're
interior division.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.933
Sullivan, Hughes,
fire attack.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.935
Find the fire,
drop-bag a hose line.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.538
Montgomery, Ruiz,
search and rescue.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.106
Evac the building.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.445
My neighbors,
they're still inside!

06:51.479 --> 06:53.280
They're old, and the husband
uses a walker.

06:53.313 --> 06:54.782
What apartment, ma'am?
Oh, God. I can't believe
I left them!

06:54.815 --> 06:56.717
Ma'am, what unit?!
That building, Unit D!

06:56.750 --> 06:58.619
Stay here.
Go around!

07:02.089 --> 07:04.057
Ah!
Cap, the hydrant's dry.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.225
City probably hasn't
updated them

07:05.258 --> 07:06.994
in this neighborhood
in years.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.996
Yeah, well, if we need
more than the 500 gallons--

07:09.029 --> 07:10.464
I'll get a tanker.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.799
Dispatch-- this is
incident command.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.902
We need a tanker ASAP!

07:14.935 --> 07:16.770
Set it for next week.
Okay. Got you.

07:16.804 --> 07:20.073
Then you have the budget meeting
with city council at 1:00.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.842
That doesn't leave you time
for a lunch break.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.110
Do you want--
Kel, you know I don't
take a lunch break.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.746
1:00 is fine.
No lunch?

07:25.779 --> 07:28.516
That must be how you keep
such a slim figure.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.817
Michael Dixon.

07:29.850 --> 07:30.984
I forget we work
in the same building

07:31.018 --> 07:32.753
since you're
hardly ever here.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.422
So, Montgomery-- he's become
quite the fan favorite, huh?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.190
You threatened?

07:37.224 --> 07:38.792
Oh, yeah, I was really
counting on that boost

07:38.826 --> 07:40.628
from the gay
Asian voting bloc.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.864
10% of nurses in Washington
state are Asian American.

07:43.897 --> 07:44.998
Oh, oh, wait!

07:45.032 --> 07:46.166
The Nurses Union
endorsement is key

07:46.199 --> 07:47.467
in the mayoral race,
isn't it?

07:47.501 --> 07:50.037
So is the Police Union's.
And Fire.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.539
Two out of three.

07:53.373 --> 07:57.110
You think Montgomery has
the Fire Union in his pocket?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.612
Wow!

07:58.646 --> 08:00.614
19-- they really
live in their own

08:00.648 --> 08:02.616
little bubble,
don't they?

08:02.650 --> 08:04.685
Send them my cuddles
and snuggles, Ross.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.119
Nice makeover,
by the way.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.155
The tie made you look
so mannish.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.024
Says a guy with a spray tan.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.060
I don't think we need
to admit you,

08:13.093 --> 08:15.162
but I would like to observe you
for a little while longer,

08:15.195 --> 08:16.997
just to be sure.
Okay?

08:17.030 --> 08:18.766
Thank you, Doctor.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.138
Hey.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.140
Why are you acting surprised
to see me?

08:27.174 --> 08:28.341
You know I work here.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.143
Yeah, not so much
surprised as, um--

08:30.177 --> 08:31.979
Ashamed?

08:32.012 --> 08:33.480
I was gonna say afraid.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.283
Can we finish yelling at
me after I get some pain meds?

08:39.252 --> 08:40.754
You think I'm yelling?

08:40.788 --> 08:42.690
Is that not
what's happening?

08:42.723 --> 08:44.091
No, Jack,
I'm not yelling at you.

08:44.124 --> 08:47.027
Have you ever been yelled at
by an Italian?

08:47.060 --> 08:49.029
Yeah, you.

08:49.062 --> 08:52.232
Well, then, when I yell,
you'll know.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.101
Show me.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.038
This looks horrible.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.708
I am sorry, by the way.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.844
Yeah, for abandoning us after
committing to be our donor?

09:03.877 --> 09:05.779
Uh-huh, you should
feel sorry about that.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.581
"Abandon" is
a strong word.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.750
No, that's
the accurate word.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.852
You made me believe that you had
made a real change

09:11.885 --> 09:13.621
and you had
matured and grown

09:13.654 --> 09:15.055
into somebody
that I could trust,

09:15.088 --> 09:17.057
and you are none
of these things.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.391
None.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.927
Yeah, no, you're right.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.294
Squeeze.
You dodged a bullet with me.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.731
I suck.
Don't just agree with me.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.098
I'm-- Okay.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.900
Um, you're wrong.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.101
Shut up?

09:28.135 --> 09:29.937
Oh, my God!

09:36.443 --> 09:38.812
Apartment D
is up on the right.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.750
Hello?!

09:42.783 --> 09:44.785
Can anyone inside
reach the door?!

09:50.157 --> 09:51.625
Please! Help us!

09:53.627 --> 09:54.962
Come on.
Come on, sir.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.164
Let me help, let me help.
Back up, back up.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.431
Ma'am, can you walk?
Yes, yes.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.500
Okay, follow us!

10:00.533 --> 10:02.135
Okay, no! No, no, no!
Leave it!

10:02.169 --> 10:03.436
Leave the vitamins,
and let's go!

10:03.470 --> 10:05.305
It's time to go.
It's time to go.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.674
Oh, no, no!
Okay, no!

10:06.707 --> 10:08.141
Whatever that is,
it's not--

10:08.175 --> 10:10.110
Okay, it's your wedding album.
That is important.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.344
Keep moving,
all the way out.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.980
Is he okay?
Nice and slow.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.690
That way!
Follow them!

10:22.723 --> 10:24.424
Checking for an extension.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.994
Why are there no
smoke alarms going off?

10:27.027 --> 10:28.361
Is anyone up here?!

10:28.395 --> 10:29.997
Hello?! Hello?!

10:30.030 --> 10:32.099
What in the world
is this stuff?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.106
Sounds like we got fire
in the walls.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.641
I just got to tie off
for the hose.

10:41.675 --> 10:44.311
What the hell are all
these computer servers for?

10:46.814 --> 10:48.982
Ah, damn it!
What are you doing here?

10:50.818 --> 10:53.386
Hey, hey, hey!
You gotta get out of here!

10:53.420 --> 10:55.122
Hughes,
cut the power.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.289
Got it!

10:56.323 --> 10:57.791
No, I can't! I gotta--
No, no, listen.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.159
I need to--

11:00.393 --> 11:02.462
Don't touch the hazard.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.464
Sully, I found
the problem!

11:04.497 --> 11:05.999
There you go,
there you go.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.973
Ready. All right.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.075
Hughes, you ready?
<i>Yeah, gimme a sec!</i>

11:15.108 --> 11:17.310
I got him, Hughes.
Get the water up here.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.979
Captain, I'm coming out.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.849
You're on the tank till we get
more water. Make it last.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.987
Just take deep breaths,
deep breaths.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.321
Okay, let's
have a seat right here.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.990
You're gonna
be okay, ma'am.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.092
What's your name?
Ivy.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.260
My husband's Gerald.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.395
Okay, Ivy.
My name's Travis.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.764
I want you
to put this on.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.999
Take slow,
deep breaths.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.700
40 years
we've lived here.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.036
Ivy, I want you to keep
this mask on, all right?

11:43.070 --> 11:46.006
I promise we're doing everything
we can to put that fire out.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.608
Okay, Gerald, slow,
deep breaths, all right?

11:48.641 --> 11:50.677
We'll have an aid car here soon
to take you to the hospital.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.013
Captain, I need an ETA
on Aid Car 19.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.916
Bishop, he was poking around
the scene of the fire.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.518
A bunch of computers
bootleg-wired together.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.020
I got him, I got him.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.924
Take a breath,
take a breath. Breathe.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.126
19, building's clear,
knock that fire down.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.095
Remember, we only got
500 gallons.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.466
Woman on P.A.:

12:13.500 --> 12:14.968
<i>Dr. Williams to NICU.</i>

12:15.002 --> 12:17.704
This is a new surgical
intern, Dr. Adams.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.239
You think
I might need surgery?

12:19.272 --> 12:21.374
I don't decide that.
He will decide that.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.643
It's pretty jacked.
What happened?

12:23.676 --> 12:26.780
It involved a tree, a tornado,
and some handcuffs.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.949
I hope
at least you had some fun.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.051
I shoulda gotten it checked out
a week ago, but--

12:31.084 --> 12:32.385
You were in
self-destruct mode,

12:32.419 --> 12:34.121
like everybody in my life
seems to be.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.923
Yeah, we're
gonna need an X-ray.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.962
Why are you looking at me?!
Go order it!

12:41.995 --> 12:44.597
Woman on P.A.: <i>Dr. Stanson,
please dial 378.</i>

12:44.631 --> 12:46.266
<i>Dr. Stanson, 378.</i>

12:46.299 --> 12:48.601
I'm pretty sure they call that
a hostile work environment.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.403
That's how interns learn.
We scare them, okay?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.505
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.975
I keep telling people that I'm
meaner because of the hormones,

12:55.008 --> 12:56.977
and that's part of it,
but it's be--

12:57.010 --> 12:58.345
it's-- it's because--

12:58.378 --> 12:59.947
I left, and you guys
had to pivot.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.614
Oh, my God, Jack, no!

13:01.648 --> 13:03.350
That has literally nothing
to do with you.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.954
There are mountains of sperm
for sale in the world.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.255
We have all the sperm
we need.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.790
Okay, yeah. No, you're right.
Not-- Not about me.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.092
I got it.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.526
It's just because
I'm so angry.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.428
I'm angry at my wife
and at the world,

13:15.462 --> 13:18.031
and anger is like
a poison that comes out

13:18.065 --> 13:20.968
as meanness, and--

13:21.001 --> 13:24.371
I used to wear pink scrubs
because work was my happy place,

13:24.404 --> 13:28.976
full of happy people,
bringing in new life, and...

13:29.009 --> 13:32.012
now we're wearing black scrubs,
in protest,

13:32.045 --> 13:37.384
because women's bodies are
held hostage by the government.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.153
And...

13:40.187 --> 13:42.990
I literally have
no happy place left.

13:45.758 --> 13:48.361
Yeah.
This keeps happening.
It's the hormones.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.397
Carina,
are you pregnant now?

13:50.430 --> 13:53.233
No.
May-- I don't know.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.169
Okay, I'm gonna need
to take you to imaging.

13:56.203 --> 13:59.072
What's the wheelchair for?
He can walk!

13:59.106 --> 14:00.540
She's not usually
this angry.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.509
Do you even know
where imaging is?

14:02.542 --> 14:04.411
That was gonna be
my next quest--

14:04.444 --> 14:07.881
Oh, my God. I'll take him.
You go l-learn stuff.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.749
You, come on, move.
You can walk, go. Okay.

14:09.782 --> 14:12.419
Come on!
Oh, my gosh, all right.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.021
I'm coming. Wow.

14:16.223 --> 14:19.526
This is gonna sting.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.062
I gotta-- Those computers,
I gotta get them out.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.197
That's a conversation for
your insurance company now.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.733
I don't understand
how this could've happened.

14:26.766 --> 14:29.069
Sounds like the complex
hasn't been well-maintained.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.038
When we first
got married,

14:31.071 --> 14:33.040
this was
a nice neighborhood.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.441
Clean.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.543
We were the only people
we knew with a pool.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.878
Ivy, I need you to keep
this mask on, please.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.548
But then, like everything else,
it started to change.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.516
They stopped
fixing the roads.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.920
The prices got so high,
the stores had to close.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.956
The building manager
covered the pool

14:48.989 --> 14:50.257
instead of
maintaining it.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.858
The rent went up.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.526
We can't afford to move,
can't afford to stay.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.228
Gerald. Gerald?

14:55.262 --> 14:56.729
Hey, Warren, I need
some help over here.

14:56.763 --> 14:59.199
What's happening?
No, Gerald! Gerald!

14:59.232 --> 15:01.368
Don't leave me!
Ma'am, stay back.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.370
They need to work.
No, no, I have to be with him.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.038
Charging!
Wait. Is he okay?

15:05.072 --> 15:06.473
No, what--
what's going on?
Clear!

15:06.506 --> 15:08.108
Why isn't-- Why isn't--
V-tach arrest still.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.909
Time for epi.
Arrest?
Does that mean heart attack?

15:09.943 --> 15:11.578
Ethan, I need you to stay calm
and take deep breaths, okay?

15:11.611 --> 15:13.413
You have to help him!
Help him!

15:13.446 --> 15:16.483
W-What's-- What's going on?
Tell me, what's going on?

15:16.516 --> 15:18.385
Gerald?
Hey,
do you know that man?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.620
Gerald, you promised.
Hey, Ethan,
do you know that man?

15:20.653 --> 15:22.822
Stay with me.
What? No,
I-I-I don't live here.

15:22.855 --> 15:25.158
Gerald! Do not leave me!
You hear me?!

15:25.192 --> 15:26.626
Miss, Gerald just needs
some space.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.928
What do you know?
What?

15:28.962 --> 15:30.730
If you know how that fire
got started

15:30.763 --> 15:32.499
and you're not telling us and
that man dies, you go to jail.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.334
Please. Please,
tell me what's going on.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.169
All right, I'm gonna
charge it again. Charging!

15:36.203 --> 15:37.337
Charging again?

15:37.370 --> 15:38.972
What does that mean?
Clear!

15:42.009 --> 15:43.476
We got him.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.112
Oh!

15:45.145 --> 15:46.513
My Gerald.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.282
Gerald, honey.
You came back to me.

15:49.316 --> 15:50.417
We need to get him
to the hospital now.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.119
Where the hell's
that aid car?

15:52.152 --> 15:54.187
What the hell?
Talk. Now.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.959
It's eating right
through these walls.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.162
Yeah, old building,
cheap material.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.297
Let's hope there's not
too much more of this.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.601
We have about
four minutes of water left.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.503
But do we have less
than four minutes of fire?

16:13.640 --> 16:16.209
Captain, how soon until
we have more supply?

16:16.243 --> 16:18.011
We have more fire
than we have water.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.054
I need an ETA ASAP.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.122
Captain, we're gonna need
that water real soon.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.790
Where's this tanker
coming from, Canada?

16:30.823 --> 16:32.059
Yeah, why don't
we have it knocked down?

16:32.092 --> 16:33.693
Dry hydrant,
short on water.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.628
Yeah, that tracks, unfortunately.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.464
You call a tanker?
Yep, still
eight minutes out.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.998
All right.
Let me try to expedite.

16:39.032 --> 16:41.401
I'm searching the perimeter
for another hydrant.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.308
Captain, we've used more
than half the supply already!

16:48.341 --> 16:51.078
Tanker's eight minutes out.
The chief is expediting.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.513
In eight minutes,
this building is toast!

17:01.621 --> 17:04.357
Captain, we do not have
to wait for the tanker.

17:04.391 --> 17:07.327

hundred gallons for the siphon.

♪ Oh, oh oh, oh, oh

18:35.382 --> 18:38.151
♪ Oh, oh oh, oh oh oh

18:40.019 --> 18:42.522
Hey. They'll bring you in
in just a minute.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.823
Thank you.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.193
Uh-- Oh.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.361
Okay, I have to ask.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.163
Was any of it true?

18:50.197 --> 18:53.032
When you left Seattle, we were
worried sick about you.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.267
And-- And Andy told us

18:54.301 --> 18:55.968
you were looking
for your foster siblings.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.970
But did you even
leave Seattle?

18:58.004 --> 18:59.472
Or have you been hiding

18:59.506 --> 19:02.041
at that drunk woman's house
this whole time?

19:02.074 --> 19:04.677
No, I-I left.
I-- I tried to find them.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.213
That--
That wasn't a lie.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.548
Okay.
And then what happened?

19:10.082 --> 19:14.120
Well, uh, it took a while,
but, um...

19:14.153 --> 19:16.456
eventually, I found out that,
uh, my brother, Cal,

19:16.489 --> 19:18.825
lives in Utah.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.027
Okay.
So that's where I went.

19:21.060 --> 19:25.131
I got his address,
went to his door, and, uh...

19:25.164 --> 19:27.200
nothing.

19:27.234 --> 19:30.036
He didn't remember me.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.839
I mean, he was 7
and I was 12,

19:32.872 --> 19:34.841
so it's a bit fuzzier
for him.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.844
But, um...

19:37.877 --> 19:39.479
I didn't think there was
much point

19:39.512 --> 19:42.682
in looking for Lily after that,
so I got in my truck,

19:42.715 --> 19:46.085
and I just drove around
for a while.

19:46.118 --> 19:50.056
Um, camped up and down
the coast.

19:50.089 --> 19:54.261
Um, slept in my truck
for a couple weeks.

19:54.294 --> 19:59.065
And then, uh, somehow,
found myself back in Seattle.

19:59.098 --> 20:03.069
That's when I walked into a bar
and saw Eva, and then, uh...

20:03.102 --> 20:06.072
Yeah, I-I guess
that was a couple months ago.

20:08.107 --> 20:11.511
I feel like the whole
world is on fire right now.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.613
E-Everyone I know

20:13.646 --> 20:18.117
is in pain or a panic,
or they're lost.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.119
Or they're ruining
their own lives

20:20.152 --> 20:23.055
or somebody else's life or...

20:23.089 --> 20:25.725
they're suffering
or grieving

20:25.758 --> 20:29.095
or trying to convince themselves
that love and life

20:29.128 --> 20:32.231
is something
worth fighting for.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.900
You're saying
I'm not special?

20:33.933 --> 20:36.436
I'm saying
we're having a moment.

20:36.469 --> 20:39.038
All of humanity seems to be
having a moment

20:39.071 --> 20:41.073
right now, and...

20:41.107 --> 20:44.110
Your story
breaks my heart, Jack,

20:44.143 --> 20:46.546
but you don't have to be
alone in your pain

20:46.579 --> 20:48.915
unless you keep choosing
to be alone.

20:52.519 --> 20:55.054
Nurse Karen: Gibson, Jack?
Yeah.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.756
Thank you.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.325
Go.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.930
Okay. There you go.
Nice and easy.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.164
And put your seat belt on.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.499
I'm not as frail
as I look.

21:06.533 --> 21:08.167
Oh, I can tell.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.452
Tell them.

21:27.186 --> 21:28.788
His computers
started the fire.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.323
His bootleg wiring job overheated

21:30.357 --> 21:32.759
and blew out
his system.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.027
It was a power surge
that fried the servers,

21:35.061 --> 21:36.796
and they're not mine.
What are they for?

21:36.829 --> 21:38.798
You're not a cop.
You can't interrogate me.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.132
He's right.
Let's just call PD.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.701
Sounds good.
That way, when they figure out

21:41.734 --> 21:43.135
whatever Dark Web,
child porn,

21:43.169 --> 21:44.804
human-trafficking ring
he's involved in,

21:44.837 --> 21:46.973
they won't have to make
a second trip to arrest him.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.141
Think of the gas they'll save. Goodness. Mm.

21:49.175 --> 21:50.510
I hope you have a good
defense attorney.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.812
Okay, okay, calm down.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.114
It's a crypto mine.
It's not illegal.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.383
I'm just trying to get
my bag up.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.717
What's a crypto mine?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.018
Basically,
a giant calculator

21:59.051 --> 22:00.152
looking for the next
piece of an equation

22:00.186 --> 22:03.456
that's somehow worth
a lot of money.

22:03.490 --> 22:07.560
What, you think I got rich
playing Keno, Bishop?

22:07.594 --> 22:09.662
Whose servers are they?

22:09.696 --> 22:11.664
Chief.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.400
PD will get
this out of him.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.067
Yeah.
How long will that take?

22:15.101 --> 22:16.669
Whoever put him in charge
of this operation

22:16.703 --> 22:18.070
likely has others,

22:18.104 --> 22:19.706
and if they're as shoddily
rigged as this one,

22:19.739 --> 22:21.708
they're just fire hazards
waiting to happen.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.245
Listen, Ethan.

22:26.278 --> 22:27.680
I understand
what it's like

22:27.714 --> 22:29.248
to follow orders,
be a good soldier.

22:29.281 --> 22:32.151
But following orders just cost
40 people their homes

22:32.184 --> 22:33.520
and possibly
their lungs.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.388
Is that worth the few

22:35.422 --> 22:37.256
extra bucks that you
and whoever put you up
to this are gonna make?

22:37.289 --> 22:39.225
Welcome to capitalism.

22:39.258 --> 22:40.827
Tech billionaires, developers?

22:40.860 --> 22:42.562
They're cheating the system
for billions,

22:42.595 --> 22:44.997
and the city calls it
a "tax incentive."

22:45.031 --> 22:47.233
I run a few crypto rigs
out of my apartment,

22:47.266 --> 22:49.001
but I'm a criminal?

22:49.035 --> 22:51.370
Yeah, well, siphoning
electric power is a crime,

22:51.404 --> 22:53.239
and if that man Gerald dies,
are you willing to go to prison

22:53.272 --> 22:55.174
to protect whoever
put you up to this?

23:02.081 --> 23:03.450
Will he be okay?

23:03.483 --> 23:05.117
Well, he's not
quite alert yet,

23:05.151 --> 23:07.787
and he's not out of the woods,
but I think he'll be okay.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.689
Oh, please, God.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.592
We're old but not old enough
to bury each other.

23:12.625 --> 23:13.893
Yeah, well, I have
every intention

23:13.926 --> 23:15.294
of living to be
100 years old,

23:15.327 --> 23:17.363
and I expect my wife
to do the same.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.098
I get it.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.734
What about you?
Do you have a wife?

23:21.768 --> 23:24.103
I do not. Oh.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.539
I had a husband, though.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.140
Oh!

23:28.174 --> 23:29.942
My grandson is gay.

23:29.976 --> 23:33.112
That's--
Congratulations.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.047
You know, he's--
he's running for mayor.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.549
No, sir!
Oh, yeah.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.050
Isn't that something?

23:38.084 --> 23:40.553
W-What's your name?
I-I'll write it down.

23:40.587 --> 23:44.156
Uh, Montgomery, Travis.

23:44.190 --> 23:48.561
Well, now, if you're running for
mayor, you'll need a husband!

23:48.595 --> 23:51.598
Here-- take my
grandson's number.

23:51.631 --> 23:54.066
T-Thank you, Ivy,
but, you know, I--

23:54.100 --> 23:58.270
I tried dating a grandson once,
and it didn't work out.

23:58.304 --> 24:00.139
You haven't
met my grandson.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.641
Right.
You know what?

24:01.674 --> 24:03.309
You give me that number.
I'll make sure he--

24:03.342 --> 24:04.343
Okay.
Yeah.

24:04.376 --> 24:05.778
Thank you, Warren.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.514
I'm here to help.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.348
And this guy, "Bryan,"
he paid you

24:09.381 --> 24:10.950
to illegally bootleg
the servers?

24:10.983 --> 24:12.785
They're his rigs,
he wired them.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.587
And you just let him?

24:14.621 --> 24:17.023
He paid me 2 grand a month,
so, yeah, I let him.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.626
To keep his computer equipment?
Why you? Why your place?

24:19.659 --> 24:21.994
I'm a college student,
which means that I am poor,

24:22.028 --> 24:24.531
which means I qualify for cheap
power through the city's

24:24.564 --> 24:26.633
Utility Discount Program.

24:26.666 --> 24:29.602
Mining takes a lot of power,
and the cheaper the power,

24:29.636 --> 24:33.640
the bigger your profit margin,
and he's making a killing.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.474
Already had another mine
at another guy's apartment

24:35.508 --> 24:36.809
with 10 rigs going.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.044
Where?

24:38.077 --> 24:39.979
I don't know.
I swear!

24:40.012 --> 24:41.814
Probably some crappy
complex like this one.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.182
And the crappier
the building,

24:43.215 --> 24:44.617
the less chance of anyone
asking questions.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.719
As if being poor
weren't bad enough.

24:46.753 --> 24:48.955
"Bryan" is not answering.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.356
Do we just start
knocking on doors

24:50.389 --> 24:51.991
at all low-income housing
buildings all over town?

24:52.024 --> 24:53.626
Sure, Bishop, why don't you
go get a head start?

24:53.660 --> 24:55.027
No, no.
We call City Light,

24:55.061 --> 24:56.228
see how many
low-income units

24:56.262 --> 24:57.530
are drawing unusual
amounts of power.

24:57.564 --> 24:58.965
That'll take days.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.032
Not for the Fire Chief.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.204
It's Chief Ross from SFD.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.139
You know, you're not a bad
captain when you're sober.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.108
Wish I could say the same
about you, Bishop.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.545
You guys used to date
or something?

25:12.579 --> 25:14.513
'Cause that dude
really hates you.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.983
Shut up.
Just sign here for discharge.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.284
Just use your finger.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.654
Ethan, this is
your last chance.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.656
Where are Bryan's
other crypto mines?

25:23.690 --> 25:25.658
I swear to God,
I don't know.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.059
What did City Light say?

25:27.093 --> 25:29.061
There are power surges
happening all over the city.

25:29.095 --> 25:32.098
Bryan's crypto mines
just became ticking time bombs.

25:32.131 --> 25:33.733
All right.
This just became critical.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.835
I need all users drawing
way above average power.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.908
All right, 19!

25:41.941 --> 25:43.542
Engine's going to the pin
that I sent you, Sullivan.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.044
Beckett's gonna take the ladder
to the other address.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.879
I've got the third one.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.715
We're looking for illegally
wired computer servers.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.082
So what do we do
when we find them?

25:50.116 --> 25:51.918
We politely ask whoever
is there to unplug them.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.285
And what if they don't?

25:53.319 --> 25:54.954
Then you call Dispatch
for PD backup, all right?

25:54.987 --> 25:56.522
Keep going till we hit
all five spots

25:56.555 --> 25:58.925
or we get another call,
whatever comes first.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.126
All right, let's go!

26:03.830 --> 26:06.365
"Only you can prevent
crypto fires."

26:07.967 --> 26:09.268
I don't get it.

26:09.301 --> 26:10.970
You had to be
born in the '80s.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.205
Bishop must be
hating life right now,

26:13.239 --> 26:15.975
stuck on a field trip
with Beckett.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.610
They're both professionals.

26:17.644 --> 26:19.979
He's probably making her scrape
the gum off the bottom

26:20.012 --> 26:21.547
of the seats
or something.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.616
Man, I gotta know
what she threatened him with.

26:23.650 --> 26:26.719
I'm sure whatever happened
was blown out of proportion.

26:26.753 --> 26:29.922
You don't think the Chief
hit on her, do you?

26:29.956 --> 26:31.590
'Cause if that
is what happened,

26:31.624 --> 26:33.760
I'm honestly a little offended
it wasn't me.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.795
But I guess--
All right, that's enough.
Knock it off, all right?

26:35.828 --> 26:37.830
It's--
It's disrespectful.

26:37.864 --> 26:40.232
Oh, come on.
Only if we say it to her face.

26:41.668 --> 26:44.336
Herrera, don't take
away all my fun.

26:44.370 --> 26:47.306
Uh, that's it.
Uh, right up there.

26:48.775 --> 26:50.943
We sure this guy
isn't violent?

26:50.977 --> 26:52.578
No. We don't know anything
at this point.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.080
And what if he tries to--
Oh, I think we found him.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.748
Hey!
Hey, hey!

26:55.782 --> 26:57.817
Hey, are you Bryan?!
I don't know any Bryan.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.585
I-I'm not doing anything illegal.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.821
Look, we're Seattle Fire.
We just want to talk to you.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.489
We aren't cops. We just
want to make sure
there's no fire hazard!

27:03.522 --> 27:05.424
Wait, no!

27:05.457 --> 27:07.660
- Hey, hey!
- Ooh!

27:07.694 --> 27:09.028
Ugh.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.998
Oh, no.
Ooh. Ooh, okay.
All right.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.800
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.936
Well, that was a bust.

27:16.969 --> 27:20.840
Next address
is 582 Willow.

27:22.541 --> 27:23.676
So, you're into Bitcoin?

27:23.710 --> 27:24.977
How about some tunes,
Kline?

27:25.011 --> 27:27.446
We never listen to tunes
in the rig anymore.

27:29.181 --> 27:32.051
♪ Gonna have
a real good time tonight ♪

27:32.084 --> 27:35.221
♪ Ain't nobody gonna
fuss or fight ♪

27:35.254 --> 27:37.790
Come on, Kline!

27:37.824 --> 27:41.160
♪ Gonna have a real
good time tonight ♪

27:41.193 --> 27:43.696
♪ Oh, yeah

27:43.730 --> 27:45.832
Yeah,
you got some-- Oof!

27:45.865 --> 27:47.033
Some bad bruising
but at least

27:47.066 --> 27:50.402
no open wounds or bleeding. Thanks.

27:51.838 --> 27:55.842
All right, this is gonna help
with the swelling, all right?

27:55.875 --> 27:57.676
Can you keep
me covered up, man?

27:57.710 --> 27:59.245
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

27:59.278 --> 28:00.913
I'd be more concerned about
the fire you're responsible for,

28:00.947 --> 28:02.882
the utility fraud
you committed

28:02.915 --> 28:04.583
than us seeing your weird li--
All right,
all right, Hughes.

28:04.616 --> 28:06.385
Hughes.
Shutting up.

28:06.418 --> 28:07.820
You hit your head
pretty hard.

28:07.854 --> 28:08.988
Both of them. Hughes.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.857
Shutting up!

28:10.890 --> 28:12.925
Concussion?
Most likely.

28:12.959 --> 28:14.160
He's gonna need a trip
to the hospital

28:14.193 --> 28:16.062
on his way to prison. Herrera.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.064
Okay.
I'm shutting up now.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.999
I feel you, man.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.368
I mean... damn.

28:22.401 --> 28:25.271
Captain,
we found Crypto Bro.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.538
We need to get him
to the hospital.

28:26.572 --> 28:28.775
What's the status
on the aid car?

28:28.808 --> 28:31.110
Copy, Aid Car 19
en route.

28:34.146 --> 28:37.083
So, uh, listen...

28:37.116 --> 28:38.584
I don't know
if Hughes is right

28:38.617 --> 28:40.052
about this whole
you needing a partner thing,

28:40.086 --> 28:42.889
but I have Ivy's grandson's
number.

28:42.922 --> 28:45.191
So he's a tall drink of water,
I hear.
War--
Not you, Warren.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.292
Please-- Please not you, too, okay?

28:46.325 --> 28:47.927
Can you not try
to set me up, too?

28:47.960 --> 28:50.362
I don't need
that from you.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.731
I don't know why nobody
believes me

28:52.765 --> 28:55.067
when I say I'm not trying
to actually win.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.969
Oh, I know why.

28:57.003 --> 28:59.471
Because <i>you</i> don't
believe you.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.440
I don't want to win. Yeah.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.542
Because if I do,
the chances of me

29:03.575 --> 29:05.812
becoming like Dixon
are way too high,

29:05.845 --> 29:08.380
and I'm hanging way too close
to that edge already.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.249
Why? Why?

29:10.282 --> 29:12.751
Because you--
you got a little good press?

29:12.785 --> 29:15.087
A-And you
actually liked it?

29:15.121 --> 29:16.555
Come on, Montgomery,
look--

29:16.588 --> 29:19.258
you could buy a dozen billboards
a-and a Super Bowl ad,

29:19.291 --> 29:23.595
and you still wouldn't be a
fraction as corrupt as that man.

29:23.629 --> 29:25.031
I promise you.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.270
Think I could
just do an X?

29:31.303 --> 29:33.372
I don't care.

29:34.841 --> 29:36.442
Bye.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.744
What did radiology say?

29:38.777 --> 29:40.179
Buckle fracture
of the distal radius.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.014
But, you know,
just a splint, so...

29:42.048 --> 29:43.816
Does it still hurt?

29:43.850 --> 29:45.784
I'm fine.

29:45.818 --> 29:48.020
You know, all of humanity
is in pain, so...

29:48.054 --> 29:49.321
I wasn't dismissing

29:49.355 --> 29:50.756
your pain, Jack.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.024
I know.

29:52.058 --> 29:53.792
I was just saying
don't be alone in it.

29:53.826 --> 29:56.262
Don't add pain to your pain
by keeping it

29:56.295 --> 29:58.530
all to yourself when there
are people who love you.

29:58.564 --> 30:00.867
I was saying the abuses
of your childhood

30:00.900 --> 30:04.336
will only define you if you
need everything to end in chaos.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.438
I-I-I was saying,
don't self-destruct!

30:06.472 --> 30:10.609
J-Just get help when the people
you love tell you you need help!

30:10.642 --> 30:11.978
Wow.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.046
I think I'm talking
to my wife.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.014
She's not here.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.883
Oh, I know!

30:18.817 --> 30:21.020
That's what it sounds like
when an Italian yells at y--

30:21.053 --> 30:22.154
You don't care.

30:22.188 --> 30:23.155
Nope.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.525
New theory.
Mm!

30:26.558 --> 30:28.160
The chief and Beckett have
an illegal crypto pool,

30:28.194 --> 30:29.528
and Bishop found out.

30:29.561 --> 30:31.663
Oh, so maybe Chief is in cahoots
with Bryan in there!

30:31.697 --> 30:33.032
I like it!

30:33.065 --> 30:34.566
Maybe Chief Ross has
a drinking problem herself.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.202
And Maya
threatened to out her

30:36.235 --> 30:38.004
if she didn't fire Beckett.
Right?
Yeah, yeah.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.838
Well, if that's true,
how come both Beckett

30:39.872 --> 30:41.407
and the Chief
are still around?

30:41.440 --> 30:45.411
Because they both got clean,
except the Chief did it

30:45.444 --> 30:47.646
the right way
so you could never tell.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.148
Not like the captain,
who just, you know,

30:49.181 --> 30:51.083
subbed booze
for breath mints.

30:51.117 --> 30:52.851
Okay, guys,
seriously, stop.

30:52.885 --> 30:54.020
Oh, God, it's just a joke, Herrera.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.487
Yeah,
it's all good fun.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.423
Except it's not,
because it's real people

30:57.456 --> 30:59.158
and real lives
you're talking about.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.459
Oh, okay.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.329
All right.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.932
You want to know what Maya
said to the Chief?

31:05.965 --> 31:08.067
Oh, you know?
Yeah, you know now?

31:08.100 --> 31:09.335
Of course I do!
Yeah, dude, tell us.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.070
We all knew you knew.

31:11.103 --> 31:14.173
It was because of me.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.043
Bishop went to the Chief
and said that if the Chief

31:17.076 --> 31:19.946
doesn't fire Beckett
and make me captain of 19,

31:19.979 --> 31:22.348
Maya was gonna make
a public stink about the Chief

31:22.381 --> 31:25.051
looking the other way
about Beckett's drinking.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.718
And then, right after,
Gibson left,

31:26.752 --> 31:28.220
so there was
room for me--

31:28.254 --> 31:30.189
Yeah, and she didn't
have to fire Beckett

31:30.222 --> 31:31.123
and told him to get clean.

31:31.157 --> 31:32.424
Right.
Right.

31:32.458 --> 31:33.859
And the Chief told
Beckett that

31:33.892 --> 31:36.195
Maya tried
to get him canned.

31:36.228 --> 31:39.231
Mm. I mean, that's
kinda sneaky, and I like it.

31:39.265 --> 31:42.434
And now Beckett has the freshest
breath in the department...

31:42.468 --> 31:44.536
And a serious grudge
against Bishop.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.905
And I-I just
found out,

31:46.939 --> 31:49.541
so, look, her-- her plan
kinda worked, right?

31:49.575 --> 31:50.909
I'm back.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.811
Yeah, Senior Man. Right.

31:52.844 --> 31:54.246
All right, so just stop
with the--

31:54.280 --> 31:56.215
the rumors and the gossip.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.417
And let's just focus on getting
Gibson back on his feet,

31:58.450 --> 32:01.587
and let's-- let's have
each other's backs, all right?

32:01.620 --> 32:02.989
Yeah.
19! God!

32:03.022 --> 32:04.957
19!
Thank you!

32:18.337 --> 32:21.140
Crypto Bro okay?

32:21.173 --> 32:22.975
Concussion.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.977
And gnarly
groin injury.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.812
Yeah, he won't be riding
any horses anytime soon.

32:28.214 --> 32:29.581
No, he scrambled his
own eggs by jumping off

32:29.615 --> 32:31.117
that balcony
to avoid getting caught.

32:31.150 --> 32:32.518
Yeah, but, you know,
we, uh--

32:32.551 --> 32:34.086
we kind of played cowboy,
though, right?

32:34.120 --> 32:35.787
Fire safety is
in our purview.

32:35.821 --> 32:37.956
I agree.
The guy's a criminal.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.358
He did this to himself.

32:39.391 --> 32:41.160
I mean, he preyed
on poor people

32:41.193 --> 32:42.361
and the city's lack
of empathy for their needs.

32:42.394 --> 32:43.595
What?
Yeah, in order to

32:43.629 --> 32:45.197
"get his own bag up."

32:45.231 --> 32:46.932
His bag is
all the way up

32:46.965 --> 32:48.500
in his abdominal cavity
right now.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.036
Vic, no!

32:50.069 --> 32:51.103
No! Too soon.
Come on!
Yeah!

32:51.137 --> 32:52.638
You know
who's into crypto?

32:52.671 --> 32:54.840
Bishop, why do I see your wife
around here

32:54.873 --> 32:56.308
more than
my own girlfriend?

32:56.342 --> 32:58.077
You have a girlfriend?

33:00.846 --> 33:02.214
He has a girlfriend.

33:02.248 --> 33:06.052
So he gets laid regularly
and is still a dick?

33:06.085 --> 33:09.021
Stop with the rumors
and gossip.

33:09.055 --> 33:10.889
Just ignore him.

33:10.922 --> 33:12.558
Yeah,
I'm good at that.

33:12.591 --> 33:15.494
I was just telling Andy
that I saw Jack this morning.

33:15.527 --> 33:18.797
At the hospital?
Yeah, at least he finally
got his wrist looked at.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.800
Yeah, he's not doing well.
He-- He needs help.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.469
Yeah, that was clear
when we found him drunk,

33:23.502 --> 33:26.472
under a tree,
handcuffed to Eva Vasquez's bed.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.174
I thought
he was your friend.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.309
He was,
and then he left.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.511
Look, if the department
really takes care of its own,

33:32.544 --> 33:34.313
there's probably, like,
an outreach program--

33:34.346 --> 33:36.148
If you guys are
talking about Gibson,

33:36.182 --> 33:38.016
he already made his own bed out
of handcuffs and greenery.

33:38.050 --> 33:41.853
You can have your girl talk
here, but I need to eat.

33:41.887 --> 33:43.722
Ciao.

33:44.956 --> 33:46.892
And I need a workout.

33:46.925 --> 33:48.227
Maya--

33:48.260 --> 33:50.062
I am sorry
Jack is struggling,

33:50.096 --> 33:51.063
but he ditched us.

33:51.097 --> 33:52.831
Yeah,
that's kinda cold.

33:52.864 --> 33:55.567
I mean, do we have each
other's backs, or do we not?

33:55.601 --> 33:57.203
I'm dealing with
my own problems right now.

33:59.271 --> 34:02.541
Except you're not
really dealing with them.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.510
I am, in my own way.

34:04.543 --> 34:05.944
Okay.

34:05.977 --> 34:08.680
H-Have you started looking
for therapists?

34:08.714 --> 34:10.015
I'm gonna
go get cleaned up.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.883
No.

34:11.917 --> 34:13.952
No me, or no her?

34:13.985 --> 34:15.254
I'm sorry I haven't
done everything

34:15.287 --> 34:16.755
on your timeline, Carina.

34:16.788 --> 34:18.257
I'm living in my own
personal hell.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.459
And my co-workers are now
gossiping about me--

34:20.492 --> 34:22.060
Actually, I fixed that--
And my boss hates me

34:22.094 --> 34:24.096
and treats me worse
than I was treated as a probie.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.964
And now my wife
can't have my back

34:25.997 --> 34:28.234
because she has suddenly
decided that I am unstable.

34:28.267 --> 34:30.269
So, no, I haven't
researched therapists

34:30.302 --> 34:32.804
because I've been kind of
busy with all of that.

34:41.480 --> 34:45.251
I'm sorry.
I-- I-I-I'll call Jack again.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.786
Thank you.
I'm heading out.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.962
Ready?

34:58.930 --> 35:03.101
Booze up and be somebody!

35:03.135 --> 35:05.971
Mm. Mm!

35:06.004 --> 35:07.072
Hey, baby.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.106
Hey.

35:08.140 --> 35:09.408
Want a shot?

35:09.441 --> 35:10.942
I'll do one with you. Okay.

35:10.976 --> 35:13.179
What'd you do today?

35:15.214 --> 35:17.816
Whoo-hoo!
Ha ha!

35:17.849 --> 35:19.818
Does this mean you can
pull my hair again?

35:19.851 --> 35:22.354
Soon, yeah.

35:22.388 --> 35:23.989
To getting
your grip back.

35:24.022 --> 35:25.824
Mm.

35:32.164 --> 35:34.866
Oh, excuse me.
Have we met?

35:36.868 --> 35:38.470
You know, that shower
was not nearly as good

35:38.504 --> 35:39.871
as the one
this morning.

35:39.905 --> 35:41.006
Yeah, well, I have
better body wash.

35:41.039 --> 35:42.808
That must be it.

35:46.178 --> 35:48.914
Mm.

35:53.352 --> 35:54.786
What?

35:54.820 --> 35:57.623
I just-- You're not real.
This isn't real.

35:57.656 --> 36:00.025
This is too... perfect.

36:00.058 --> 36:02.160
Come on.
No, I'm...

36:04.430 --> 36:06.898
I'm so in love
with you.

36:08.166 --> 36:11.237
And we have mind-blowing sex,
and we work together, here,

36:11.270 --> 36:14.506
without friction or awkwardness
or competitiveness.

36:14.540 --> 36:15.874
Those aren't bad things.
I know.

36:15.907 --> 36:17.243
I just feel like
I'm being lulled

36:17.276 --> 36:19.077
into this sense
of comfort and security,

36:19.110 --> 36:22.147
and I'm totally unaware
of this giant pile of bricks

36:22.180 --> 36:25.251
that's about to drop on my head,
so can you just drop it

36:25.284 --> 36:27.453
and let's just
get it over with?

36:29.054 --> 36:31.156
Are you a con artist?

36:31.189 --> 36:33.525
Or in witness protection?

36:33.559 --> 36:37.896
Or, like, a closet crypto bro
or something?

36:37.929 --> 36:40.432
Things are good, so something's
got to be wrong with me?

36:40.466 --> 36:43.068
No, I'm just saying,
look at Carina, okay?

36:43.101 --> 36:45.504
She marries Maya, thinking
she met the perfect match,

36:45.537 --> 36:47.072
and they're living
this picture-perfect life,

36:47.105 --> 36:50.909
and then, turns out,
Maya's just a nasty blackmailer.

36:50.942 --> 36:53.178
Are you really surprised?

36:53.211 --> 36:55.747
I am just saying,

36:55.781 --> 36:59.050
if there is something
that I should know,

36:59.084 --> 37:01.119
or, like, a shoe
that's about to drop, can--

37:01.152 --> 37:03.188
I thought it was bricks
about to drop.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.926
Okay.

37:11.397 --> 37:14.366
What if nothing's
about to drop?

37:14.400 --> 37:16.935
What if I pinch myself
every morning

37:16.968 --> 37:21.540
because I can't believe
how lucky I am to have you?

37:21.573 --> 37:24.042
What if sometimes I don't
think you're real?

37:24.075 --> 37:25.344
Hmm?

37:27.245 --> 37:31.317
What if, last year,
when we broke up and you...

37:31.350 --> 37:33.819
were pregnant...

37:33.852 --> 37:37.389
what if I thought that was,
for sure, the end?

37:37.423 --> 37:40.992
And maybe I cried.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.728
Yeah.

37:42.761 --> 37:46.298
And I thought, "It was good
while it lasted."

37:46.332 --> 37:49.100
Well, here we are. Yeah.

37:49.134 --> 37:52.103
And, uh, I might've
blackmailed Beckett...

37:52.137 --> 37:56.041
Ugh.
...to taking me
when 23 closed down.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.911
Canoodling
in the firehouse!

37:59.945 --> 38:01.347
Oh!
Well, I am shocked.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.181
Sorry, Mayor Trav. Yes.

38:03.214 --> 38:05.584
Mayor Trav.
How about
a shame ticket for you?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.686
You can have one, too.
I don't need any shame.

38:07.719 --> 38:09.621
That's right.

38:11.690 --> 38:14.593
I feel like
I'm having déjà vu.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.428
Yeah, just
burning off the day.

38:16.462 --> 38:18.029
Yeah.

38:18.063 --> 38:21.467
Well, listen, I-I just wanted
to say that, um...

38:21.500 --> 38:24.503
Herrera told us
about what you did.

38:25.537 --> 38:26.938
How you went toe-to-toe
with Ross

38:26.972 --> 38:29.375
to get her job back
at 19.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.209
That took guts.

38:31.242 --> 38:32.878
But it was
the right thing to do,

38:32.911 --> 38:35.113
'cause, you know, Herrera,
she belongs here.

38:35.146 --> 38:38.049
All right?
So, uh, good looking out.

38:39.184 --> 38:41.252
Yeah.
