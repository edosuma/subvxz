03:48.211 --> 03:49.228
But this other girl, Chelsea,

03:49.379 --> 03:50.787
was also looking
at Susmita's test,

03:50.789 --> 03:52.472
and she was just copying down
all of her answers.

03:59.147 --> 04:01.131
So what? Now you're worried
she's gonna tell on you?

04:01.300 --> 04:02.557
What? I didn't even
think about that.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.134

we're already helping.

04:04.227 --> 04:05.652
Well, do you think
she's gonna tell on you?

04:05.804 --> 04:07.637
I mean, she doesn't seem like
the telling on people type,

04:07.731 --> 04:10.490
since she's, you know,
basically, uh, a criminal.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.583
She's the girl
who got in trouble

04:11.735 --> 04:13.252
for saying the F-word 23 times

04:13.328 --> 04:15.069
during one game of kickball
and she got suspended.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.329
Is that the same girl

04:16.482 --> 04:17.739
who spray-painted
the F-word on the bleachers?

04:17.833 --> 04:19.483
Yeah, she really
likes the F-word.

04:19.501 --> 04:22.152
So, do you think
she thinks you'll tell on her?

04:24.080 --> 04:25.322
Well, let me help you out.

04:25.340 --> 04:27.081

you're gonna tell on her.

04:34.758 --> 04:36.500
if you saw this girl cheating,
and she saw you cheating...

04:36.518 --> 04:37.943
-I wasn't.
-...she might think

04:38.094 --> 04:40.520
she has to tell on you
before you tell on her.

04:40.672 --> 04:42.522
I'm not gonna tell on her.
I'm terrified of her.

04:42.599 --> 04:44.691
And maybe she knows that,
but maybe she thinks

04:44.843 --> 04:46.267
you might
tell on her anonymously,

04:46.287 --> 04:47.786
like say,
by writing it on a note

04:48.013 --> 04:50.271

little doll's fanny pack?

05:52.669 --> 05:54.353
And the heat is off
in the restaurant,

05:54.580 --> 05:58.172

customers expect to have heat.

<i> a nice accent piece.</i>

07:01.255 --> 07:03.313
Thanks for calling back, Teddy.

07:03.406 --> 07:05.498
Yeah, it's broken-broken.
Do you think you could come?

07:05.592 --> 07:08.260
Bob, I've literally
had this exact dream.

07:08.411 --> 07:09.744
Your heater breaks. I rush over.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.171
Linda is scared and so are you,

07:11.265 --> 07:13.173
but I look you both in the eyes
and I say,

07:13.341 --> 07:16.660
"Shh-shh, I'm here.
Teddy's here. You're fine."

07:16.678 --> 07:18.586
And we all hold hands
while I fix your heater.

07:18.664 --> 07:20.513
I don't know how
I do it with no hands.

07:20.666 --> 07:21.848
Maybe I use my feet?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.350
-Mm-hmm. So, can you come over?
<i> -I can't.</i>

07:24.445 --> 07:27.112
I'm headed to a job.
Ah, why do I take jobs?

07:27.263 --> 07:28.672
<i> -Oh, my God.</i>
-But don't worry.

07:28.690 --> 07:30.431
I know an
HVAC guy who's really good,

07:30.451 --> 07:33.176
but you know, he's a sweet man.
Maybe a little sensitive.

07:33.269 --> 07:34.527
But, what does that mean?

07:34.680 --> 07:35.603
<i> Just don't razz him.</i>

07:35.697 --> 07:37.013
I know you like to razz, Bob.

07:37.106 --> 07:38.773
<i> -I-I don't razz.</i>
-You roast. You razz.

07:38.867 --> 07:41.034
-Teddy, that's not true.
<i> -Ask anybody.</i>

07:41.186 --> 07:42.869
Teddy, I just want
our heater to work.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.162
I'll send you his number.

07:44.314 --> 07:45.780
Boy, I hit the brakes,
like, 20 seconds ago

07:45.799 --> 07:48.800
and I'm still skidding.
I just slid right by my exit.

07:49.027 --> 07:50.026
Teddy, be careful.

07:50.028 --> 07:51.303
<i>Ah, you know what I'm gonna do?</i>

07:51.530 --> 07:53.530
<i> I'm gonna gently steer</i>
<i> into the guard rail.</i>

07:53.699 --> 07:55.048
-Teddy, don't do that.
<i> -Hell of a time for</i>
<i> a roast, Bobby.</i>

07:55.200 --> 07:56.700
-That wasn't a roast.
<i> -I'm just about to go into</i>

07:56.702 --> 07:58.459
<i> a guard rail,</i>
<i> and you're razzing me.</i>

07:58.479 --> 08:01.054
<i> Oh, I regained control,</i>
<i> but I should probably go.</i>

08:01.148 --> 08:02.222
LOUISE:
It's nice in here.

08:02.316 --> 08:03.873
Maybe nicer than our house?

08:03.967 --> 08:05.709
Oh, my God. It's so cozy.

08:05.727 --> 08:08.211
There's my comforter.
Just right there on the floor.

08:08.230 --> 08:09.713
And I'm using your pillow
as my foot rest.

08:09.806 --> 08:11.323
My feet are gonna
smell like your face.

08:11.399 --> 08:13.325
No. Give it to me.
(sniffs, groans)

08:13.476 --> 08:14.400
It's too late. Keep it.

08:14.495 --> 08:15.494
Tina, you okay, sweetie?

08:15.645 --> 08:17.329
You look anxious.
You have to poop?

08:17.480 --> 08:20.147
I'm great. So happy
we're not going to school.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.391
Well, it's gonna be
a little longer

08:21.409 --> 08:22.909
until the heat gets fixed today.

08:23.061 --> 08:24.077
Do you guys need anything?

08:24.229 --> 08:26.079
Hot cocoa please?
And just keep it coming?

08:26.231 --> 08:27.839
Yeah, okay.
You kids just stay here

08:28.066 --> 08:29.582
-and make everything smell bad.
-On it.

08:29.735 --> 08:32.010
Ugh, Teddy's heater guy
still isn't answering.

08:32.237 --> 08:33.236
Probably busy today.

08:33.405 --> 08:34.738
Or maybe he's out
making a snowman?

08:34.831 --> 08:36.089
It's just,
if you run a business,

08:36.183 --> 08:37.757
you should pick up
your ph... Hi.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.184
Hey. This is, uh, Bob Belcher.

08:39.335 --> 08:41.186
I got your number from Teddy.

08:41.413 --> 08:43.337
What-what did... What did I say?

08:43.357 --> 08:46.082
Oh, I said
if-if you run a business,

08:46.101 --> 08:47.250
you should pick up your phone.

08:47.269 --> 08:48.843
But I was talking
about something else,

08:48.937 --> 08:51.254
'cause you did
pick up your phone. Eventually.

08:51.347 --> 08:52.422
Hello? Oh, good.

08:52.515 --> 08:54.274
I-I thought you...
I thought you hung up.

08:54.426 --> 08:56.426
You're doing great, Bob.
But do it better.

08:56.519 --> 08:59.929
What a day.
No school, no restaurant.

09:00.023 --> 09:01.281
Bottomless hot cocoa on the way.

09:01.433 --> 09:03.357
Bottomless hot cocoa?
Yes, please.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.268
No, no-no-no.
You'll catch your death.

09:05.361 --> 09:07.194
-Keep your cheeks warm.
-Fine.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.289
♪<i> Call Jeffrey Ruth</i>
<i> Seafood Delivery</i> ♪

09:09.441 --> 09:11.608
Nope. Nope. Nuh-uh. Not in here.

09:11.701 --> 09:12.717
Wait, where did Tina go?

09:12.869 --> 09:14.201
TINA (muffled):
I didn't cheat!

09:14.263 --> 09:16.446
There she is.
Tina, we have to fix you.

09:16.539 --> 09:18.114
For the sake
of the Pillow Palace,

09:18.133 --> 09:19.373
which is a name
I'm workshopping.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.301
-Cushion Castle?
-Damn it, that's better.

09:21.453 --> 09:22.635
The only thing that could fix me

09:22.729 --> 09:24.470
would be going to school
and talking to Chelsea.

09:24.547 --> 09:26.565
I'm gonna put the blanket back
over you. Night-night.

09:26.674 --> 09:28.474
Tina, there's some
exciting new technology

09:28.627 --> 09:30.735
I think you should know about.
It's called the telephone.

09:30.887 --> 09:32.128
Call Chelsea?

09:32.147 --> 09:33.313
I don't know the number
of whatever burner phone

09:33.465 --> 09:34.923
she's probably using right now.

09:35.058 --> 09:36.633
Mom and Dad have to
have a school directory

09:36.726 --> 09:37.650
around here somewhere, right?

09:37.803 --> 09:39.152
Oh, my God. School directory.

09:39.304 --> 09:40.412
Yeah, go ask Mom and Dad for it

09:40.563 --> 09:42.229
and find out what's
going on with that cocoa.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.490
Yeah, this miss
needs some Swiss.

09:44.643 --> 09:45.825
He's gonna come, right?

09:45.977 --> 09:47.919
I feel like
we won't survive the night.

09:48.071 --> 09:49.254
And that's bad parenting.

09:49.405 --> 09:50.905
I mean he said
he was gonna come.

09:50.999 --> 09:52.148
Maybe-maybe I should
call him again.

09:52.241 --> 09:54.000
Bob, it's fine. Get me the milk.

09:54.152 --> 09:55.318
But wait, smell it first.

09:55.487 --> 09:57.337
(sniffs)
Let's say it's good enough.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.246
Hey, hey, hey.
Uh, I want to, um,

09:59.341 --> 10:00.915
call a friend from school

10:00.934 --> 10:02.375
that's always been my friend.

10:02.527 --> 10:04.327
So do you happen to have
the school directory handy?

10:04.420 --> 10:05.586
I forgot some of the numbers.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.439
I know there's a six,
just need a couple more.

10:07.666 --> 10:09.608
School directory.
Where have I seen that?

10:09.835 --> 10:12.185
Oh. I think it's under
the leg of our bed frame

10:12.337 --> 10:13.837
'cause the legs are uneven.

10:13.855 --> 10:15.505
Or our house is.
I'm not sure which.

10:15.523 --> 10:17.173
Uh, we didn't think
you kids would need it

10:17.192 --> 10:19.892
'cause you don't seem to
ever call anyone or do things.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.269
Not in a bad way.
You-you have each other.

10:22.364 --> 10:24.772
Um, I'm gonna go get it
from under your bed. Bye.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.367
Oh, and, uh, the Cushion Castle
is still waiting on that cocoa.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.368
Taste this.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.944
Oh, I was wrong. Milk's bad.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.112
Do you think they'll notice?

10:31.206 --> 10:32.856
I think start over.
Just use water.

10:32.949 --> 10:35.541
We shouldn't make our
kids drink old milk, right?

10:35.694 --> 10:37.135
Okay, Dr. Fresh Milk.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.363
I got it.
And apparently I can lift beds

10:40.382 --> 10:42.474
when I'm really stressed out.
Anyway, I'm calling her.

10:42.550 --> 10:44.142
Quick question.
Who would you guys call

10:44.293 --> 10:46.127
if you needed a lot of fish,
but in a jiffy?

10:46.146 --> 10:47.294
-Gene, no.
-It's ringing.

10:47.389 --> 10:49.706
Uh, hey, is this Chelsea?

10:49.724 --> 10:51.465
Hi, it's Tina. From school?

10:51.485 --> 10:52.466
Why are you calling me?

10:52.486 --> 10:54.210
Well, I was trying
to talk to you

10:54.229 --> 10:55.987
after the history test
yesterday,

10:56.139 --> 10:57.489
but you kind of ran off there.

10:57.716 --> 11:01.234
Anyway, I just wanted to
talk about the, um, thing?

11:01.386 --> 11:03.052
Oh, you mean when you cheated?

11:03.146 --> 11:04.645
No, no, no, when you cheated.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.647
Sorry. Sorry. (nervous laughter)

11:06.667 --> 11:10.059
So, what? Are you calling just
to tell me you told on me?

11:10.061 --> 11:12.486
No. No. No, no, no, no, no.
I definitely didn't tell on you.

11:12.506 --> 11:15.156
And also, I wasn't cheating.
I-I got the right answer

11:15.175 --> 11:16.508
before I looked
at Susmita's test.

11:16.735 --> 11:18.067
So, I'm not a cheater.

11:18.161 --> 11:19.585
-Okay, great. Neither am I.
-Yup, great.

11:19.738 --> 11:22.572
So, uh, just, since
we're talking about it,

11:22.590 --> 11:25.258
um, did you tell on me?

11:25.385 --> 11:27.334
Oh, you know what? I might have.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.412
I might've written it
on like a little note

11:29.414 --> 11:32.190
and put it in that creepy
puppet's pocket or something.

11:32.341 --> 11:34.192
Fanny pack!
You put it in his fanny pack.

11:34.419 --> 11:36.252
Well, this has been fun. Bye.

11:36.271 --> 11:38.196
(gasping) She told on me.

11:38.423 --> 11:39.847
Chelsea told on me! (shouts)

11:39.941 --> 11:42.275
I don't know if the castle can
handle this kind of meltdown.

11:42.427 --> 11:44.277
-(Tina shouts)
-No, no, no, no, no.

11:44.429 --> 11:45.203
(shouting)

11:45.430 --> 11:46.930
GENE:
Hmm, kind of feels like

11:46.948 --> 11:48.373
we're just sitting on
the floor now. Gross.

11:51.953 --> 11:53.712
Ah! Chelsea told on me.

11:53.939 --> 11:55.696
But I didn't do anything.
I didn't cheat off Susmita.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.623
Oh, no. What's sweet, sweet
Susmita going to think of me?

11:57.776 --> 12:00.126
I'll just switch schools.
Or Susmita should.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.778
Or we both should?
How does this work?

12:01.796 --> 12:04.038
I can't believe my life is being
ruined by a stupid puppet.

12:04.132 --> 12:05.631
Oh wait, Mr. Frond's puppet.

12:05.726 --> 12:08.393
You know what, I'm just gonna
text the heater guy real quick.

12:08.544 --> 12:10.787
Maybe I'll just casually
send him our address.

12:10.805 --> 12:13.064
-So he has it.
-You already told him
where we were.

12:13.291 --> 12:14.399
Well, now
he'll have it in writing.

12:14.626 --> 12:17.477
"Here is our address again."
(groans) New phone.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.888
Not good at texting on it.
And... send.

12:20.982 --> 12:22.073
-Oh, my God.
-What?

12:22.150 --> 12:24.075
It wrote "again"
in all caps somehow.

12:24.152 --> 12:25.243
So, now it's like
I'm yelling at him.

12:25.394 --> 12:27.245
Like, "Here is
our address AGAIN."

12:27.396 --> 12:28.747
I told you not to text him.

12:28.898 --> 12:31.232
I'm going to apologize.
"My bad."

12:31.251 --> 12:33.400
-Wait, no. Oh, my God.
-What?

12:33.420 --> 12:35.344
It autocorrected
"bad" to "butt,"

12:35.480 --> 12:37.163
so I just texted him, "My butt."

12:37.257 --> 12:39.090
Just stop, Bob.
Put down the phone.

12:39.317 --> 12:42.668
Okay, I just wrote, "My bad.
Not my butt. Please still come."

12:42.821 --> 12:43.669
Okay, good save.

12:43.764 --> 12:44.578
I'm bringing the super special,

12:44.598 --> 12:45.764
no-spoiled-milk cocoa

12:45.991 --> 12:47.507
to our maybe
slightly spoiled kids.

12:47.659 --> 12:49.250
Don't call anyone,
don't text anyone.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.417
Uh, I'm calling Teddy.

12:50.495 --> 12:52.161
LINDA:
Just stop calling people!

12:52.180 --> 12:53.179
It's going to voice mail.

12:53.331 --> 12:55.348
Teddy, it's Bob.
Um, I think I did bad.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.849
I might need you
to call that guy

12:56.943 --> 12:58.167
and tell him that I'm nice,

12:58.186 --> 13:00.594
and that-that
we don't deserve to die.

13:00.688 --> 13:02.447
Really good cocoa time.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.507
Just a second, Mom.
We weren't expecting

13:04.526 --> 13:06.359
a teen-nado to destroy
our precious palace.

13:06.528 --> 13:09.270
But I think we've built back
better, stronger, cozier.

13:09.364 --> 13:11.197
What happened? Where's Tina?
What's going on?

13:11.291 --> 13:12.606
She's fine, she's fine.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.108
Nothing you need
to concern yourself with.

13:14.202 --> 13:15.943
Some might blame
the lateness of the cocoa,

13:15.962 --> 13:17.278
but I think that's unfair.

13:17.372 --> 13:19.205
I'm here. Hi. Thank you, Mom.
I'll take those.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.948
And off you go.
Back to the kitchen.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.041
Heh. Oh, not to be sexist.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.543
I might go to a different room.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.619
Nah, I'm going to the kitchen.

13:25.639 --> 13:26.696
I'm gonna heat up some crackers.

13:26.698 --> 13:28.122
Hey. So, we're glad you're back,

13:28.216 --> 13:30.216
and we're hoping you're
not gonna go all standy-uppy.

13:30.368 --> 13:32.310
The insurance company
paid for the repairs,

13:32.537 --> 13:34.203
but we don't want to
go through that again.

13:34.297 --> 13:35.796
We're still
rebuilding emotionally.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.316
I have an idea. I just need
the school directory again.

13:38.543 --> 13:39.876
There's someone
I have to talk to.

13:39.894 --> 13:41.468
-Who are you calling?
-Mr. Frond.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.987
I can get ahead of this.
I just have to tell him

13:43.064 --> 13:44.805
that there's a note in Billy's
fanny pack that's not true.

13:44.899 --> 13:47.141
Sounds like a desperate, last
ditch effort to save yourself.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.827
-Thank you. It's ringing.
-(line ringing)

13:48.936 --> 13:50.477
(TV music playing)

13:50.497 --> 13:52.555
No, Phillip.
Don't answer the phone.

13:52.648 --> 13:55.558
Not until the glutes and quads
cooldown routine.

13:55.651 --> 13:58.244
You owe it to them because
they are on fire right now.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.338
No answer. Crap.
Crap, crap, crap.

14:00.565 --> 14:03.490
Sorry, T. Guess you'll just have
to deal with Billy tomorrow.

14:03.585 --> 14:04.658
No. I'm calling back.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.493
-(phone ringing)
-Leave me alone.

14:06.588 --> 14:08.495
I'm toning. (groans)

14:08.590 --> 14:09.922
Dang it. Okay, okay.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.407
You know what's better
than a phone call?

14:11.500 --> 14:13.017
Me going to Mr. Frond's house.
He has to be home.

14:13.169 --> 14:15.094
And I know where he lives.
And-and if he's not home,

14:15.188 --> 14:16.579
I'll wait for him.
Or I'll find him.

14:16.598 --> 14:18.581
I'll hunt him down.
I'll get his scent, track him,

14:18.600 --> 14:20.375
and then I tell him,
"You gonna believe me

14:20.377 --> 14:21.675
or you gonna
believe that puppet?"

14:21.844 --> 14:23.177
And he's gonna look in my eyes,

14:23.196 --> 14:25.012
and he's gonna believe me.
I love this plan.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.255
How are you gonna get there?

14:26.349 --> 14:28.441
With these two bad girls.
My feet.

14:28.593 --> 14:30.426
They taste just like
regular crackers,

14:30.519 --> 14:31.852
but they're hot.
And I love them.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.262
They feel good
on your face, too.

14:33.281 --> 14:34.614

14:34.766 --> 14:36.265
Ooh. Mm, crackers. Mm, crackers.

14:36.434 --> 14:37.617
Lin, what are we gonna do
if he doesn't come?

14:37.693 --> 14:39.452
I don't think
we can stay here tonight.

14:39.604 --> 14:42.121
We could all pile into the kids'
little blanket castle thing.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.624
It'll be breathy,
but maybe kind of warmish?

14:44.718 --> 14:47.051
I don't know, I think we might
have to go to a hotel.

14:47.278 --> 14:49.278
Or probably a motel,
'cause poor.

14:49.297 --> 14:50.537
Wait, could we even get there?

14:50.557 --> 14:52.056
I don't think our car
can drive in this.

14:52.283 --> 14:53.633

we might be stuck here.

Uh, give me... Give me
more crackers. More crackers.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.438
I'm putting them on my face.
Put them on your face.

14:58.623 --> 14:59.546
-Ow.
-What?

14:59.566 --> 15:01.474
I don't want
hot crackers on my face.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.234
-They're hot.
-You get used to it.

15:03.461 --> 15:04.644
(groans) Is this our life now?

15:04.738 --> 15:06.462
Should we just leave
the oven on and open it a little

15:06.555 --> 15:08.481
-so we can use it as a heater?
-Bob, no!

15:08.633 --> 15:11.576
I think, like, 20 million people
die like that every month.

15:11.727 --> 15:13.469
What? Oh, my God,
that's so many.

15:13.562 --> 15:15.580
That's awful.
Wait, it can't be that many.

15:15.731 --> 15:16.989
Just stay away from the oven.

15:17.142 --> 15:18.565
You know what? I'm calling
the heater guy again.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.419
Fine, call him,
but try not be how you are.

15:21.570 --> 15:22.662
I always try to do that.

15:22.830 --> 15:25.572
(sighs) Bob sounded
so upset in that message.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.760
He just had to razz,
and now his family's freezing.

15:28.911 --> 15:30.836
That's straight, right?
Looks straight.

15:30.989 --> 15:33.580
What does it even matter?
People are dying out there.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.007

15:35.101 --> 15:36.826
Yes. I'm fine, Mr. Yazdian.

Everything's fine!

15:38.163 --> 15:39.270
Tina, it's really cold

15:39.497 --> 15:41.088
and windy and snowy out there.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.440
The truth will keep me warm.

15:42.667 --> 15:44.500
I mean, it's like
really cold, Tina.

15:44.593 --> 15:47.094
Justice will be my jacket.
And also this jacket.

15:47.188 --> 15:49.096
Mm-hmm. And what do we
tell Mom and Dad

15:49.190 --> 15:50.114
if they ask where you went?

15:50.266 --> 15:52.024
Tell them I went
for a... stroll?

15:52.118 --> 15:53.192
Winter storm stroll. Got it.

15:53.344 --> 15:54.435
That sounds delightful.

15:54.529 --> 15:56.512
Enjoy yourself
out there, sister.

15:56.531 --> 15:59.106
-(wind gusting)
-(shivering)

15:59.125 --> 16:00.349
Oh, my God. So cold.

The truth

16:09.118 --> 16:10.635
Oh. Hi, restaurant.

16:10.786 --> 16:12.119
Do you kids want hot crackers?

16:12.213 --> 16:13.471
Your mother and I
are having hot crackers.

16:13.698 --> 16:15.289
We don't know if the heater guy
is coming or not

16:15.366 --> 16:16.474
and it's nobody's fault.

16:16.701 --> 16:18.309
-It's my fault.
-It's your father's fault.

16:18.461 --> 16:20.219
Had a really bad phone call.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.146
A couple of them.
Some bad texts, too. Sorry.

16:22.298 --> 16:24.890
Ooh, yes to crackers.
Also, more cocoa please.

16:25.043 --> 16:27.485

-Tina, you want one, too?

16:27.654 --> 16:28.878

Um, Gene.

16:30.139 --> 16:31.881
GENE:
No?

16:31.899 --> 16:33.140
Uh, did you murder Tina?

16:33.234 --> 16:34.141
W-Where's Tina?

16:34.160 --> 16:35.309
That's her, isn't it?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.161
That is not. That is a pillow.

16:37.313 --> 16:38.979
-What?
-Kids, where's your sister?

16:39.073 --> 16:40.406
She went for a stroll.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.667
A totally normal
winter storm stroll.

Oh, my God, Bob,

16:49.158 --> 16:50.041
Like an Encino Man.

16:50.193 --> 16:51.567
I'll go find her. Louise?

16:51.660 --> 16:53.236
Got any tips which
direction I should go?

16:53.296 --> 16:54.828
-Towards Mr. Frond's house?
-What?

16:54.922 --> 16:56.405
I'm just using that
as a direction,

16:56.424 --> 16:58.407
like some people say,
"Go towards the water."

16:58.426 --> 17:00.167
You know, go towards

Ah! Accountability Billy?

17:06.693 --> 17:08.434
Uh, it seems like you're
going around my back

17:08.586 --> 17:10.511
to talk to
Mr. Frond about something,

17:10.605 --> 17:12.938
so I'm just here
to say, uh, ouch.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.423
And I can't let you do that.

17:14.592 --> 17:15.682
What do you mean?
Are you threatening me?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.777
All accountability reports
go through Billy.

17:17.895 --> 17:19.945
That's Billy's business.
So, back off.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.523
No. I'm gonna tell
Mr. Frond I'm not a cheater.

17:22.617 --> 17:25.376
Oh. I don't know, Tina.
I mean, is that true?

17:25.603 --> 17:26.602
Yes, it's true.

17:26.604 --> 17:28.195
Okay. But, like, uh,
I have to ask...

17:28.214 --> 17:29.380
What would you have done
if Susmita had

17:29.532 --> 17:31.382
-a different answer than you?
-What?

17:31.459 --> 17:33.367
When you looked at her test,
she had the same answer.

17:33.461 --> 17:35.294
But what if she had
circled a different answer?

17:35.446 --> 17:37.113
What would you have done?
Would you have changed yours?

17:37.131 --> 17:39.873
No. I-I mean...
I don't want to talk about it.

17:39.967 --> 17:41.208
Tina, you can tell me.

17:41.302 --> 17:43.286
In fact, you should tell me.
It'll feel better.

17:43.379 --> 17:44.453
And if you don't tell me,

17:44.472 --> 17:45.546
it'll make Billy angry.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.398
And you don't
want to make Billy angry.

17:47.625 --> 17:48.733
♪<i> Da-da-da-dah</i> ♪

17:48.884 --> 17:51.627
Whoa. Okay, maybe
I would've cheated.

17:51.646 --> 17:53.312
Okay, Billy?
If she had a different answer,

17:53.464 --> 17:55.073
maybe I would've
changed mine to hers.

17:55.224 --> 17:56.223
I studied so hard for that test

17:56.392 --> 17:57.800
and I wanted
to get a good grade.

17:57.893 --> 17:59.302
So, I guess
maybe I am a cheater.

17:59.395 --> 18:00.469
Are you happy? Huh?

18:00.563 --> 18:01.412
I mean, a little.

18:01.639 --> 18:02.580
Ugh. God. (grunts)

18:02.731 --> 18:04.156
Uh, no, don't kick snow at me.

18:04.309 --> 18:05.975

18:09.997 --> 18:11.089
What are you doing out here?

18:11.274 --> 18:12.815
Were you screaming
and kicking snow?

18:12.834 --> 18:14.483
Uh, a little. Yeah.

18:14.502 --> 18:15.668
Y-Your dad said he upset

18:15.820 --> 18:17.911
the heater repair guy
and he's not gonna come.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.746
I finished the
other job really well,

18:19.766 --> 18:22.100
and I hopped in my truck, but
then it got stuck in the snow

18:22.251 --> 18:24.677
a couple miles away,
so I decided to walk.

18:24.829 --> 18:25.511
Get on my back.

18:25.663 --> 18:27.421
I mean, I can probably walk.

18:27.515 --> 18:29.107
Okay, good. Thanks.

18:29.258 --> 18:30.441
The tools are kind of heavy.

18:30.593 --> 18:32.110
-I'm gonna go find Tina.
-(front door opens)

18:32.261 --> 18:33.427
Never mind. Tina's here.

18:33.596 --> 18:34.612
With Teddy.

18:34.763 --> 18:35.947
Don't worry, you're all safe.

18:36.098 --> 18:37.356
Teddy's here to save the day.

18:37.508 --> 18:39.283
I'm gonna fix your heater.
But I'm also really cold.

18:39.435 --> 18:41.344
And weak.
And I can't feel my body.

18:41.362 --> 18:42.603
But then Chelsea told on me

18:42.697 --> 18:44.455
that I was a cheater,
and maybe I am a cheater

18:44.682 --> 18:45.939
'cause if Susmita had
had a different answer,

18:45.959 --> 18:48.275
I might have changed mine
like a cheating cheater.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.443
So this is why you've been

18:49.462 --> 18:51.520
acting so weird all day,
moping around.

18:51.539 --> 18:54.690
Destroying award-winning pillow
and blanket architecture.

18:54.709 --> 18:55.949
I'm a terrible cheater person.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.468
You're not a terrible
cheater person.

18:57.695 --> 18:59.862
You didn't cheat,
so let's start there.

18:59.881 --> 19:01.955
Maybe if Susmita
had a different answer,

19:01.975 --> 19:04.066
you would've changed yours,
but maybe not.

19:04.126 --> 19:05.868
So there's no point
in beating yourself up,

19:05.887 --> 19:07.370
-'cause you don't know.
-Yeah?

19:07.388 --> 19:09.296
And next time you're
in this situation,

19:09.390 --> 19:10.706
you probably won't
cheat then either

19:10.725 --> 19:12.541
because you know how bad
you feel right now.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.543
-Really bad.
-And hey, when I was your age,

19:14.637 --> 19:16.803
I did a little looking,
I did a little peeking.

19:16.898 --> 19:18.805
Except for when I was sitting
in the back of the class

19:18.900 --> 19:20.065
with the dum-dums.

19:20.234 --> 19:21.400
I knew they didn't
have the right answer.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.643
-Lin.
-I'm saying,

19:22.662 --> 19:24.553
I didn't feel good
when I did it either.

19:24.572 --> 19:25.812
But here's the thing:

19:25.832 --> 19:27.147
Even if you do something
you're not proud of,

19:27.241 --> 19:29.500
that's okay, too.
That's survivable.

19:29.652 --> 19:31.227
You don't have to
go out in snowstorms.

19:31.245 --> 19:32.578
That's not always survivable.

19:32.730 --> 19:35.231
20 million people a week
die in snowstorms.

19:35.249 --> 19:37.400
-That's true.
-There-there would be no people.

19:37.418 --> 19:38.992
-Dad. Shh.
-Sorry. I just...

19:39.012 --> 19:41.161
So, yeah, don't forget
to cut yourself some slack.

19:41.222 --> 19:42.738
You're a good kid.

19:42.831 --> 19:44.740
Thanks, Mom, but I'm still gonna
get in a lot of trouble tomorrow

19:44.833 --> 19:47.334
when Mr. Frond pulls a note
out of Billy's fanny pack.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.911
-Wait, what?
-Who's Billy?

19:49.004 --> 19:50.095
A disciplinary puppet.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.505
What is wrong with your school?

19:51.599 --> 19:53.916
Okay, so, yeah, you might
get in a lot of trouble.

19:53.935 --> 19:55.676
-Oh.
-Should we go murder the puppet?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.344
-Lin.
