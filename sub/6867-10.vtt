shoot a jillion stupid A-hole bullets at me.

18:52.731 --> 18:54.460
Not me. I wasn't shooting.

18:54.666 --> 18:57.829
And you, the worst of the bunch.

18:58.036 --> 18:59.264
Me? Why me?

18:59.471 --> 19:02.235
Five thousand measly dollars.

19:02.441 --> 19:06.172

19:06.378 --> 19:07.538
PAM: Yeah?
- L... You...

19:07.746 --> 19:09.475
Well, let's see how much you wiggle...

19:09.681 --> 19:12.514

5000 bucks' worth of your ass.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.310
MALORY: What?
- Hey, whoa, Pam.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.215
Lana, let her have this one.

19:16.421 --> 19:17.513
MALORY:
Sterling.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.691
Somebody? Anybody?

19:19.892 --> 19:22.326
Yeah, anybody...

19:22.528 --> 19:23.517
ALL:
Ugh.

19:23.729 --> 19:26.220
PAM:
...want a piece of this?

19:30.669 --> 19:32.193
Nope.
