00:01.160 --> 00:01.860
Peter Rabbit.

00:01.860 --> 00:03.730
Go on a run.

00:03.730 --> 00:05.640
Run for our lives.

00:05.640 --> 00:08.650
We'll tear a hole in every
fence and every wall.

00:08.650 --> 00:09.610
Peter Rabbit.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.180
Run through the fields.

00:11.180 --> 00:13.390
Run wild and free.

00:13.390 --> 00:16.340
And grab a piece of
every radish that we see.

00:16.340 --> 00:17.330
Peter Rabbit.

00:17.330 --> 00:18.810
Go day and night.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.790
Go for it all.

00:20.790 --> 00:23.750
It's time to fly, come on,
the wind's begun to blow.

00:23.750 --> 00:24.740
Let's go!

00:24.740 --> 00:27.710
Because you and I we
weren't made for going slow.

00:27.710 --> 00:28.690
Let's go!

00:28.690 --> 00:30.460

PETER RABBIT: The Tale
of the Downhill Escape.

00:49.780 --> 00:51.700
LILY: Left a bit.

00:51.700 --> 00:54.200
Right a bit.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.400
I think I'm getting
the hang of your dad's

00:57.400 --> 00:59.270
apple grabber, Benjamin.

00:59.270 --> 01:00.200
Come on, Lily.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.250
You can do it.

01:01.250 --> 01:02.700
Come on, apple.

01:08.260 --> 01:11.380
Haven't we got enough
apples now, Lilly?

01:11.380 --> 01:13.950
It's getting late.

01:13.950 --> 01:15.230
LILY: Got it.

01:15.230 --> 01:16.470
Don't worry, Benjamin.

01:16.470 --> 01:19.190
I've got a great idea for how
we get home really quickly.

01:22.620 --> 01:25.580
BENJAMIN: I don't like
where this is going.

01:25.580 --> 01:27.780
We'll ride the apple
grabber down the hill,

01:27.780 --> 01:30.900
and be the fastest rabbits
in the whole valley.

01:30.900 --> 01:33.110
Great idea.

01:33.110 --> 01:36.310
Yeah, great.

01:36.310 --> 01:37.259
Come on, Benjamin.

01:37.259 --> 01:38.400
It will be fun.

01:45.920 --> 01:46.620
Uh!

01:46.620 --> 01:47.330
Woo-hoo!

01:47.330 --> 01:48.050
Yeah!

PETER RABBIT: Woo!

01:48.750 --> 01:49.450
Rabbits are brave.

01:49.450 --> 01:50.300
Rabbits are brave.

01:50.300 --> 01:51.570
Ha-ha.

01:51.570 --> 01:54.490
We can steer by
leaning on either side.

01:54.490 --> 01:55.960
Look!

01:55.960 --> 01:57.420
Woo-hoo!

Yeah!

02:03.770 --> 02:04.470
Yeah!

Ha-ha!

02:05.720 --> 02:06.690
Woo!

02:06.690 --> 02:07.930
This isn't so bad.

02:07.930 --> 02:09.240
It's actually kind of--

02:09.240 --> 02:10.250
--boring.

02:10.250 --> 02:12.140
I know, let's go down there.

02:16.820 --> 02:17.520
Aah!

02:21.220 --> 02:21.920
Ha!

02:21.920 --> 02:23.880
That's more like it.

Woo!

Aah!

02:25.829 --> 02:27.790
Are we there yet?

02:31.210 --> 02:33.460
Wow, this is the life.

02:33.460 --> 02:35.930
Speeding down a mountain
with your best friends,

02:35.930 --> 02:37.150
and feeling the wind in your--

02:37.150 --> 02:38.150
Rock!

02:38.150 --> 02:39.640

Oh, it's those
rowdy rabbits again.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.170
I'll teach them to wake me.

03:03.360 --> 03:04.390
Does it hurt?

03:04.390 --> 03:05.090
Hurt?

03:05.090 --> 03:06.130
Ha-ha.

03:06.130 --> 03:07.540
No, of course not.

03:07.540 --> 03:08.240
Ouch!

03:08.240 --> 03:10.230
Whoa.

03:10.230 --> 03:12.360
Do you think you can
get back on the cart?

03:12.360 --> 03:13.510
The cart?

03:13.510 --> 03:16.320
Peter, the cart's what got
him hurt in the first place.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.720
Uh, that was just bad luck.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.590
Next time, it will be perfect.

03:20.590 --> 03:24.300
Um, can I say something?

03:24.300 --> 03:26.230
Ouchy.

03:26.230 --> 03:27.730
Hmm.

03:27.730 --> 03:29.829
I think you sprained your paw.

03:29.829 --> 03:30.650
Is that bad?

[GASPS]

03:36.300 --> 03:39.630
You've just got to keep it
still, and you'll be all right.

03:39.630 --> 03:41.370
One of us should get my dad.

03:41.370 --> 03:42.460
He's a doctor.

03:42.460 --> 03:43.960
He'll know what to do.

It's Old Brown!

be an owl snack.

Ugh.

Let's run for it.

04:04.540 --> 04:05.660
Wait, Peter.

04:05.660 --> 04:06.940
Down there.

04:06.940 --> 04:11.020
That looks like one of your
dad's secret escape tunnels.

04:11.020 --> 04:12.490
Good old dad.

04:12.490 --> 04:14.740
Quick, before Old
Brown spots us.

04:14.740 --> 04:16.390
Not the cart again.

It's the only way to
get you there, Benjamin.

04:19.089 --> 04:19.870

else happen to you.

bothersome bunnies!

A meal on wheels.

How convenient.

Quick, lean.

Waah!

04:56.860 --> 04:58.950
Run away if you must.

me work up an appetite!

down any more steep hills, hmm?

10:51.200 --> 10:54.660
Sorry, we broke your
apple grabber, Mr. Bouncer.

10:54.660 --> 10:56.550
Oh, no worries, Peter.

10:56.550 --> 11:00.590
I never knew I was so good
at inventing crutches.

11:00.590 --> 11:01.920
Ah-ha-ha.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.230
I'm sorry I got
you hurt, Benjamin.

11:04.230 --> 11:07.470
It was my fault we went too
fast in the first place.

11:07.470 --> 11:09.220
Are you joking?

11:09.220 --> 11:12.190
I love going fast!

11:12.190 --> 11:14.930
And we'll go twice
as fast tomorrow!

11:14.930 --> 11:18.590
But maybe we'll miss
the owl part next time.

11:18.590 --> 11:20.310
And the badger part.

11:20.310 --> 11:21.950
And the hurty leg part.

11:21.950 --> 11:23.060
And the rocks.

11:23.060 --> 11:24.410
And the cart.

11:24.410 --> 11:31.950
And um-- Why don't we just
go fishing tomorrow instead?

11:31.950 --> 11:33.150
