<i>My name is Ronald Coaltic,</i>

02:06.126 --> 02:07.343
<i>and I am not an actor,</i>

02:07.586 --> 02:09.680
<i>but I've owned my model H524...</i>

02:09.920 --> 02:12.299
<i>H52... uh, um...</i>

02:12.549 --> 02:14.597
<i>If you want me
to remember all this shit,</i>

02:14.843 --> 02:17.062
<i>at least stop with all
the goddamn distractions.</i>

02:17.304 --> 02:19.523
<i>I mean, what's going on
over there?</i>

02:21.391 --> 02:23.189
<i>Well, look through
this microscope.</i>

02:23.435 --> 02:25.062
<i>This is what's
actually happening</i>

02:25.312 --> 02:27.189
<i>right under your toes.</i>

<i>Ads, this is Rachel.</i>

03:08.563 --> 03:09.985
Uh, I'd like to buy an ad.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.358
<i>Print, online, or both'?</i>

03:11.608 --> 03:12.655
Both.

03:12.901 --> 03:13.901
<i>Business name?</i>

03:14.111 --> 03:15.579
I don't have a business.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.423
<i>Oh, you want Classifieds.
Let me transfer you.</i>

03:17.447 --> 03:19.575
No, no, no, no, look.
how do I get the real thing?

03:19.825 --> 03:20.951
Like a quarter page

03:21.201 --> 03:23.704
in someplace prominent
on your site, hmm?

03:23.954 --> 03:26.673
<i>Your name?</i>

03:26.915 --> 03:29.668
Miles Grissom, O-M.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.886
<i>And what's this an ad for?</i>

03:32.129 --> 03:34.006
I'm, uh...

03:36.842 --> 03:38.594
I'd like to offer $30,000

03:38.844 --> 03:40.697
to the first person that
can show me definitive proof

03:40.721 --> 03:41.722
of life after death,

03:41.972 --> 03:43.440
like a ghost, or...

03:43.682 --> 03:45.980
or something
I could never doubt.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.105
<i>30 grand to show you a ghost?</i>

03:49.354 --> 03:50.606
You know how every year or two,

03:50.856 --> 03:52.776
there's a headline that
pops up about an asteroid

03:52.858 --> 03:54.576
that's maybe on course
to crash into Earth

03:54.818 --> 03:56.240
and kill us all, right?

03:56.486 --> 03:59.911
And then they say,
"Oops, never mind.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.283
"It'll miss us.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.503
Death from space
is canceled."

04:04.745 --> 04:08.215
Then we get that relief.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.880
We go on about our lives
like there's no asteroid.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.464
But that's insane,

04:15.714 --> 04:18.843
because really there is
still an asteroid,

04:19.091 --> 04:21.560
that we should be afraid,

04:21.803 --> 04:23.601
because we all have one coming,

04:23.847 --> 04:25.315
and it's on a 100% guaranteed

04:25.557 --> 04:28.561
collision course with you.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.938
Your world will end.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.691
We don't get to know when,

04:33.940 --> 04:37.740
all we know for sure
is that it never misses.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.114
And look,
I know that most people

04:40.363 --> 04:42.081
are gonna be full of shit,

04:42.324 --> 04:45.077
but in this whole city,
I mean...

04:45.327 --> 04:48.922
maybe I find one
who can prove it to me.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.962
Just to know for sure.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.212
It would change everything.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.054
Hey.
Mom?

05:38.296 --> 05:39.673
Okay.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.901
Wait now, before you react,
I know you hate surprises,

05:41.925 --> 05:43.125
and I know you want me to call

05:43.343 --> 05:46.222
before heading
all the way here from...

05:46.471 --> 05:48.348
It's really good
to see you, Mom.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.989
I guess I thought or hoped
you wouldn't see it.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.033
Oh, come on, it went viral.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.873
You know, like crazy things do.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.833
So it's what, a work thing?

06:07.075 --> 06:09.703
Mom, I'm serious about this.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.833
Okay, you're making a huge
face at me right now.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.085
Relax your face.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.004
Aunt Lily left that money
for you to help,

06:15.250 --> 06:16.850
and here you go
spending half of it on...

06:16.960 --> 06:17.961
All of it.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.438
Paid the other half for the ad.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.679
You what?

06:20.922 --> 06:23.266
I can't...

06:23.508 --> 06:26.261
We agreed to find you, like,
an actual professional.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.711
Yeah, but wouldn't it be better
if this one simple thing

06:28.847 --> 06:32.943
saved me, instead of, I don't
know, 12 years of therapy?

06:33.184 --> 06:35.024
I mean, I'm in LA and I
can't even drive a car.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.442
Well, that's different.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.608
Not everyone lost their
father to these freeways.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.491
Yeah?
I was 3.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.974
You'd think by now, I'd be
able to ride more than a bike.

06:43.028 --> 06:46.749
You actually think you're
going to find something?

06:46.990 --> 06:48.037
Look at you.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.160
You do, don't you?

06:53.330 --> 06:55.207
This is nothing.

06:55.457 --> 06:58.461
Most of it's online.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.587
Don't tell me
you're not curious.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.348
(man)
<i>My tutorial will prove</i>

07:07.594 --> 07:10.438
<i>that the devil
was worshiped on pages</i>

07:10.680 --> 07:13.775
<i>but proof here in the Bible.</i>

07:14.017 --> 07:16.816
<i>sent from the Almighty God.</i>

07:17.062 --> 07:19.110
<i>When I get flashed by a light,</i>

07:19.356 --> 07:21.609
<i>I get possessed by this
German Nazi soldier.</i>

07:21.858 --> 07:23.531
<i>I don't know why.</i>

07:23.777 --> 07:25.937
<i>I've never spoken German,
I've never been to Germany...</i>

07:33.620 --> 07:35.839
(man) <i>Okay, so I got my
sister out of the hospital</i>

07:36.081 --> 07:37.082
<i>just for this.</i>

07:37.332 --> 07:39.460
<i>She can... she can...</i>

07:39.709 --> 07:41.677
<i>h' she focuses,
she can tell the...</i>

07:41.920 --> 07:44.764
<i>She has to focus,
but she can tell you</i>

07:45.006 --> 07:46.349
<i>what's going to happen...</i>

07:46.591 --> 07:48.468
<i>(distorted computer voice)</i>

07:54.808 --> 07:57.186
Dirty cheaters.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.028
Blah!

07:59.270 --> 08:01.068
(woman)
<i>She only comes in</i>

08:01.314 --> 08:02.987
<i>when everyone but me is asleep,</i>

08:03.233 --> 08:05.531

08:18.873 --> 08:20.420
<i>(distorted scream)</i>

08:20.667 --> 08:23.386
Fake.
Definitely.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.881
Look.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.431
<i>Because I can talk
to dead people.</i>

08:29.676 --> 08:31.445
(man on voicemail) So you
don't believe in ghosts, huh?

08:31.469 --> 08:33.437
<i>Well, you should.</i>

08:33.679 --> 08:34.852
<i>They're everywhere.</i>

08:35.097 --> 08:37.020
<i>I can show you, I think.</i>

08:37.267 --> 08:38.907
<i>Yeah, I'm with one
right now, a dead lady,</i>

08:39.059 --> 08:40.340
<i>who says you've seen her already</i>

08:40.562 --> 08:43.532
<i>in the...
in the grandfather clock.</i>

08:43.773 --> 08:45.571
<i>She died in that place.</i>

08:45.817 --> 08:48.195
<i>If you're intrigued,
maybe we should meet, yeah?</i>

08:48.445 --> 08:49.446
<i>Don't have a...</i>

08:49.696 --> 08:51.824
I say into the loony bin
with him.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.826
Grandfather clock?

08:55.076 --> 08:56.076
Actually, I say

08:56.244 --> 08:57.263
we throw him
in the "Maybe" pile.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.379
Why?

08:58.621 --> 08:59.981
Well, it's the only
voicemail reply

09:00.206 --> 09:01.924
I got from an unknown caller.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.386
Except I didn't
give my number out.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.220
Okay, let's see.

09:06.463 --> 09:10.263
We've got 1,067
responses, all told.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.603
Uh, 493 unconvincings
or incompletes.

09:13.845 --> 09:16.348
241 for Jesus Christ.
Amen.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.521
97 definite fakes,

09:18.767 --> 09:20.144
91 pranks,

09:20.393 --> 09:22.236
uh, 65 solicitors,

09:22.479 --> 09:24.698
26 just crazy nonsense,

09:24.939 --> 09:26.566
and 12 people who want to be

09:26.816 --> 09:28.693
my personal
psychedelic drug guide.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.071
But there are three
that are interesting.

09:31.321 --> 09:32.994
You forgot the Masturbators.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.957
No, I counted them
as solicitors.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.747
Of what?

09:36.993 --> 09:38.586
Okay, three candidates.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.956
We've got the scholar,

09:41.206 --> 09:42.628
the medium,

09:42.874 --> 09:45.502
and the entrepreneur.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.846
The first guy
is Dr. Ben Ellison.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.681
<i>We create the world around us</i>

09:49.923 --> 09:51.391
<i>with our consciousness,</i>

09:51.633 --> 09:55.183
<i>and that is why adults
rarely see ghosts.</i>

09:55.428 --> 09:58.978
<i>They've closed that door,
they've shut it up tight</i>

09:59.224 --> 10:02.194
<i>with skepticism
and suspicious questioning.</i>

10:02.435 --> 10:03.755
<i>But that door can be
opened again.</i>

10:03.853 --> 10:04.945
(Miles tapes keyboard)

10:05.188 --> 10:06.791
Says he got a technique
that will guarantee

10:06.815 --> 10:08.362
a supernatural encounter.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.235
I just like the science angle.

10:10.485 --> 10:13.489
Number two.
This is... the medium?

10:13.738 --> 10:16.332
Yes, Josefina,
down in Inglewood.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.372
Works in her family's
restaurant.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.371
<i>I cannot show you a ghost
that doesn't want to be seen.</i>

10:21.621 --> 10:23.715
<i>No one can.</i>

10:23.957 --> 10:25.254
<i>But one meditation with me,</i>

10:25.500 --> 10:28.253
<i>and I can show you
your own death</i>

10:28.503 --> 10:32.258
<i>and you can know
everything I know.</i>

10:32.507 --> 10:34.509
Okay, I believe she believes it,

10:34.759 --> 10:35.885
sure, but that isn't...

10:36.136 --> 10:38.013
Wait, wait, all of her
references vouched.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.703
I mean, would you prefer
one of those

10:39.931 --> 10:42.354
reality television
ghost hunter assholes?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.147
Okay.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.566
Third guy's the entrepreneur.

10:45.812 --> 10:46.813
Sexy phone voice.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.423
Yeah, you'll like
this one, I know.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.067
Emmett Fromm.

10:50.316 --> 10:53.786
<i>I spent 30 years
of my life in pursuit</i>

10:54.028 --> 10:56.451
<i>of the same treasure
you're digging for.</i>

10:56.698 --> 10:58.450
<i>I wanted to know for sure,</i>

10:58.700 --> 11:00.873
<i>I wanted
to live my life fearlessly.</i>

11:01.119 --> 11:05.044
<i>I traveled the world,
I talked to mystics, monks,</i>

11:05.290 --> 11:07.088
<i>and I finally found
what I was looking for</i>

11:07.333 --> 11:10.633
<i>on the top of a mountain
in Tibet.</i>

11:10.879 --> 11:14.349
<i>I paid the bulk
of my worth for it.</i>

11:14.591 --> 11:16.013
<i>After I opened this box,</i>

11:16.259 --> 11:19.559
<i>I knew it was worth every penny.</i>

11:19.804 --> 11:23.684
<i>You will have to open yourself
and see what comes out.</i>

11:25.977 --> 11:27.854
Hmm!

11:30.398 --> 11:33.117
Look at this beast.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.703
I bet you run things over
and don't even know it.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.447
You really doing this?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.074
Yes.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.135
I'm going to go see
the first guy this afternoon.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.411
The science guy?

11:42.660 --> 11:44.628
Mm-hmm. I don't trust that guy.

11:44.871 --> 11:48.000
You taking the bus?

11:48.249 --> 11:51.048
Yeah.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.716
Get in.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.839
It's sort of on my way.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.143
Maybe I'll go inside with you,

11:59.385 --> 12:01.729
make sure you don't
take any shit.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.401
(Ellison) Well, I'm thrilled,
actually, that you called me.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.083
I mean, if nothing else,
I get to see

12:08.228 --> 12:10.071
who the hell it was
put up this ad.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.065
Am I what you expected?

12:12.315 --> 12:15.364
No.
(chuckles)

12:15.610 --> 12:17.453
So what do you do, hmm?

12:17.695 --> 12:19.789
A video editor.
Nothing special.

12:20.031 --> 12:21.328
Industrial shorts,

12:21.574 --> 12:23.326
paid programming,
that sort of thing.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.887
(Charlotte) You know when you
wake up at 3:00 in the morning

12:24.911 --> 12:26.083
and the TV's still on

12:26.329 --> 12:28.089
and there are these
dead-eyed, plastic people

12:28.331 --> 12:29.878
talking excitedly
about paring knives

12:30.124 --> 12:32.047
and you want to
just quietly die?

12:32.293 --> 12:34.170
Thank my son.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.636
Yeah, it is an old,
old building.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.057
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

12:42.303 --> 12:44.647
You told me you were
Amaxophobic,

12:44.889 --> 12:46.687
classic agoraphobic,

12:46.933 --> 12:48.776
but... Seplophobia,
was that...

12:49.018 --> 12:51.271
Yeah, anything to do
with decay or rot,

12:51.521 --> 12:55.901
or heights, planes, and trains,

12:56.150 --> 12:59.700
Oh, and cars.
I really hate cars.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.574
I guess it's all kind of
the same fear, isn't it?

13:02.824 --> 13:07.500
Yes.
You would like not to die.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.043
And I don't blame you,
I quite agree.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.089
You suffer from heart defects?

13:13.334 --> 13:16.213
Circulatory issues of any kind?

13:16.462 --> 13:17.679
Hey, what is this?

13:17.922 --> 13:19.233
Is he in line
for a roller-coaster?

13:19.257 --> 13:21.055
Sort of, yes.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.061
You see, I have
a responsibility to make sure

13:23.177 --> 13:27.307
that he is fit
and capable, and credible.

13:27.557 --> 13:31.027
You've gotta understand,
this ad is vague.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.737
It's somewhat ambiguous.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.778
I mean, I could...
I could show you God himself

13:36.024 --> 13:38.823
and you could just... you could
deny it and just walk away.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.115
Okay, this isn't a check.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.908
It won't bounce.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.408
And believe me, I want
to give this to you.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.204
Let me see.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.212
Plus expenses, travel,

13:50.455 --> 13:53.925
equipment rentals, all included.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.465
Regardless of the result.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.431
Okay.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.892
Now, I know about your fears,

14:03.134 --> 14:05.102
but Phasmophobia,
fear of ghosts,

14:05.345 --> 14:06.892
that's not one of them, right?

14:07.138 --> 14:08.230
Right.

14:08.473 --> 14:09.850
But you did fear ghosts.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.442
I mean, we all did.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.828
You mean when we were little?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.650
Yes.

14:14.896 --> 14:18.571
Like that, like a child feels.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.409
That is the doorway

14:20.651 --> 14:22.904
and that's what you've
gotta get back to.

14:23.154 --> 14:24.997
That fear.

14:25.239 --> 14:28.743
The borders between
these worlds start to blur

14:28.993 --> 14:31.246
when you are paralyzed by fear.

14:31.496 --> 14:35.296
When you're powerless
because of it, like a child,

14:35.541 --> 14:39.011
then the door opens, and...

14:39.253 --> 14:42.348
a spirit... can appear.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.594
You're going to try to
scare the shit out me.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.687
(chuckling)
Yes.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.147
When can we go?

14:50.390 --> 14:51.516
Tomorrow night.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.484
Where are we going?

14:53.726 --> 14:55.446
You do that homework
that I asked you to do?

14:55.686 --> 14:56.687
Homework?

14:56.938 --> 14:58.190
He asked me to think of

14:58.439 --> 15:00.407
the scariest place
I knew from childhood.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.950
To come in with
something in mind.

15:04.195 --> 15:07.620
Mrs. Grissom,
where are we going?

15:07.865 --> 15:09.458
St. Timothy Middle School,

15:09.700 --> 15:11.373
goddamn Temecula.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.017
(Ellison) Well, what is
it about this school?

15:17.041 --> 15:18.668
What happened there?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.479
(Miles) Kieran Saville
was in the sixth grade

15:20.503 --> 15:22.801
when I was in seventh.

15:23.047 --> 15:27.427
Smaller than he should
have been, and real quiet.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.975
He always kept to himself.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.646
He died.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.520
(Ellison)
Tell me about his death.

15:37.770 --> 15:41.695
(Miles)
He died inside locker 530.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.160
(Charlotte)
He went missing in July.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.575
Rode his bike from his house
and didn't come back.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.573
They had search parties,
town meetings.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.416
They dragged the river,
remember?

15:50.658 --> 15:52.956
(Miles) When they pried
open the locker,

15:53.202 --> 15:56.456
Kieran was inside.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.174
It's a small place.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.010
No summer school, no guards.

16:01.252 --> 16:03.050
And someone shut him
in his locker,

16:03.296 --> 16:04.976
way up by the woodshop
on the second floor,

16:05.214 --> 16:08.093
where no one would
come till Fall.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.515
Whoever did it never admitted it

16:10.761 --> 16:12.980
and never got caught.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.520
I wonder if they still call it
"The Coffin Locker."

16:19.353 --> 16:21.230
(dog barking)

16:26.986 --> 16:30.035
I done night shifts
two dozen years,

16:30.281 --> 16:34.161
and this is
the weirdest shit ever.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.287
You got one hour.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.428
(computer beeps)

16:48.674 --> 16:49.971
All right, Mr. Grissom,

16:50.218 --> 16:53.017
would you lift your shirt
for me, please?

16:53.262 --> 16:55.856
It's all right, this is
not going to hurt one bit.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.146
There you are.

16:58.392 --> 17:01.271
Okay, shirt down, thank you.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.654
Give me your hand, please.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.277
All right, now lick that,

17:07.527 --> 17:09.213
like you do before you
take a shot of tequila.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.579
He's not licking anything!

17:10.820 --> 17:12.493
No, no, no, it's
Monosodium Glutamate,

17:12.740 --> 17:15.664
it's a salt, an amino
acid crystallize.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.538
It'll heighten
your fear receptors.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.507
Look, we've all three been
together the whole time.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.626
I haven't gone
into the building,

17:23.876 --> 17:25.252
I'm not going into the building.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.507
I don't know what the hell
is gonna happen.

17:28.756 --> 17:32.852
My job, all this stuff,

17:33.094 --> 17:35.563
it is to give you
your best chance

17:35.805 --> 17:38.274
to see what you
came here to see.

17:43.271 --> 17:45.148
It's safe.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.617
(wipes off hand)

17:51.862 --> 17:54.035
Now...

17:54.282 --> 17:56.159
you put these on, please.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.377
Do not take these off.
You promise me.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.045
I promise.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.293
All right.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.420
(muffled)
Thank you.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.683
<i>Mr. Grissom,
can you hear me?</i>

18:15.928 --> 18:17.350
<i>All right.</i>

18:17.597 --> 18:19.474
<i>Now, I want you to walk
to your starting point,</i>

18:19.724 --> 18:23.445
<i>Close your eyes, and breathe.</i>

18:32.653 --> 18:34.826
Just watch it, please.

18:35.072 --> 18:38.918
You know what?
You watch it.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.458
I carry a gun in here, okay?

18:41.704 --> 18:43.581
I got a license
and everything, so-...

18:43.831 --> 18:45.174
Jesus Christ.

18:45.416 --> 18:48.010
All I'm saying is
don't fuck with my son.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.258
(machine beeps)

18:54.508 --> 18:56.931
Are you there,
Mr. Grissom?

18:57.178 --> 18:58.178
(Miles)
Yes.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.556
Your eyes still closed?

18:59.805 --> 19:01.182
Yes.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.730
<i>All right.
Open them.</i>

19:03.976 --> 19:06.946
<i>Start walking.</i>

19:07.188 --> 19:09.156
<i>Who are we here for,
Mr. Grissom?</i>

19:09.398 --> 19:11.947
<i>Tell me his name.</i>

19:12.193 --> 19:14.366
Kieran.

19:14.612 --> 19:17.331
(low electric humming)

19:17.573 --> 19:18.574
What's that?

19:18.824 --> 19:21.373
Sounds, Mr. Grissom,

19:21.619 --> 19:22.836
I'm sending you sounds.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.956
(static warble)

19:29.293 --> 19:32.217
<i>What are you thinking
about, Mr. Grissom?</i>

19:32.463 --> 19:34.386
I'm thinking about him.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.509
<i>Kieran Saville.</i>

19:36.759 --> 19:39.478
<i>Dying in a small metal box,</i>

19:39.720 --> 19:41.848
<i>alone.</i>

19:42.098 --> 19:43.520
<i>Call him.</i>

19:43.766 --> 19:45.188
Kieran?

19:45.434 --> 19:47.311
I can't hear you,
Mr. Grissom.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.070
Kieran!

19:53.984 --> 19:55.861
<i>Go to the stairs.</i>

20:29.186 --> 20:31.860
(humming intensifies)

20:32.106 --> 20:33.699
(breathing heavily)

20:33.941 --> 20:35.614
Can I take
the headphones off, please?

20:35.860 --> 20:36.860
No.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.027
I don't think I can...

20:38.195 --> 20:39.287
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

20:39.530 --> 20:41.407
<i>You're not gonna stop now.</i>

21:00.009 --> 21:01.886
<i>Go to the locker.</i>

21:35.711 --> 21:37.429
(whispers)
I'm here.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.890
<i>Now again, call him.</i>

21:44.512 --> 21:45.604
Kieran?

21:45.846 --> 21:47.769
<i>Open the locker.</i>

21:48.015 --> 21:50.017
No, I can't It's locked.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.019
<i>Is it?
Try.</i>

21:52.269 --> 21:54.943
<i>(static warbles)</i>

21:55.189 --> 21:57.487
I can't move.

22:00.528 --> 22:03.577
I can't move anything.

22:03.823 --> 22:04.870
I can barely...

22:05.115 --> 22:06.992
<i>Open it!</i>

22:16.210 --> 22:18.087
<i>(distorted laughter)</i>

22:28.848 --> 22:30.725
(locker door closes)

22:43.404 --> 22:44.576
It's incredible.

22:44.822 --> 22:46.415
Look at you.
You're still shaking.

22:46.657 --> 22:47.658
I just...

22:47.908 --> 22:49.251
It'll take some time.
No.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.710
You just have to...

22:50.953 --> 22:53.001
You just have to let it
settle in, all right?

22:53.247 --> 22:54.715
No, no, no it was him.

22:54.957 --> 22:56.083
It was him.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.335
I mean, that's gotta be...

22:58.586 --> 23:00.964
No, no, that is proof.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.467
But of what, exactly?

23:04.717 --> 23:06.185
I can't wrap my mind
around this.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.304
(Charlotte)
Hey!

23:08.554 --> 23:10.648
I caught the ghost.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.609
I'm a ghost catcher,
or whatever you call it.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.032
(Miles)
Let's just go.

23:24.278 --> 23:26.656
We'll just get in the car.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.658
Mr. Grissom?

23:30.910 --> 23:33.129
The boy was a failsafe.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.713
He was a what?

23:34.955 --> 23:36.832
A failsafe.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.084
I told him to come out
of the wood shop if,

23:39.335 --> 23:42.339
and only if, nothing
happened at the locker.

23:42.588 --> 23:45.432
Those were his instructions,
I swear to you.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.301
You thought it would work.

23:47.551 --> 23:50.350
It did work, or it did with me.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.145
It just...
It's...

23:53.390 --> 23:56.269
It's just not foolproof.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.566
Not yet.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.689
(engine starts)

24:11.367 --> 24:12.914
Drive slower.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.161
(car thumps)

24:14.411 --> 24:16.459
Mom, careful, please.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.333
Are the child locks on?
It's stuck.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.623
It's been stuck like that
for Christ knows how long.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.055
I really like the back seat.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.230
It makes me feel like
when I was really little.

24:36.433 --> 24:37.776
Mmm.

24:38.018 --> 24:41.238
I used to sit back here
and look between you two.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.734
Jesus, this car is old as hell.

24:44.984 --> 24:48.329
I was right here looking
between you and Dad.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.493
(Charlotte)
You really remember that?

24:50.739 --> 24:52.161
He'd drop me off at the cleaners

24:52.408 --> 24:54.536
on his way to the factory.

24:54.785 --> 24:57.584
The whole drive,

24:57.830 --> 24:59.878
we'd have these
elaborate fake arguments

25:00.124 --> 25:02.268
over which one of us got to
take you to work with them.

25:02.292 --> 25:03.589
You both wanted me.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.509
Yes.
Always.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.598
You were the greatest baby.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.764
And whoever came up with
the best lie

25:11.010 --> 25:12.170
for why they needed you more,

25:12.261 --> 25:14.138
they'd win you for the day.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.030
I'll go see the medium tomorrow,

25:23.272 --> 25:25.491
but don't worry, there's
a bus that goes right...

25:25.733 --> 25:28.031
I'm not going anywhere.

25:28.277 --> 25:29.494
It's not what you think,

25:29.737 --> 25:31.172
I'm not staying
because I think it'll work.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.995
It won't work.

25:34.241 --> 25:37.040
It won't.

25:37.286 --> 25:40.631
Somewhere in you,
you know that already.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.466
What do I know?

25:42.708 --> 25:44.710
That we go out like lights.
What else would we do?

25:47.046 --> 25:48.514
What if you're wrong?

25:48.756 --> 25:51.305
If I'm wrong?

25:51.550 --> 25:53.052
Actually, the idea of more

25:53.302 --> 25:55.555
doesn't exactly give me relief.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.647
Really?
Really.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.767
You don't hope
for anything else?

26:00.017 --> 26:03.112
No.

26:03.353 --> 26:06.152
So you wouldn't want to
see Dad again?

26:08.901 --> 26:10.369
I think everything should end,

26:10.611 --> 26:11.737
no matter how good.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.830
Enough is enough.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.872
It's ugly to beg for more.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.081
(utensils clanking)

26:23.832 --> 26:26.506
Josefina?

26:26.752 --> 26:29.631
Uh, you answered my ad.

26:29.880 --> 26:33.885
We tried to call ahead,
but your line was dead.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.807
We didn't mean to scare you.

26:36.053 --> 26:37.179
Honestly.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.749
We thought the address
you gave us

26:38.847 --> 26:39.847
was your home address.

26:39.890 --> 26:42.894
It is.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.020
Upstairs.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.284
This way.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.923
(whispering)

27:08.168 --> 27:10.842
Should we...

27:11.088 --> 27:13.341
<i>Si.</i>

27:13.590 --> 27:16.343
Please, sit.

27:16.593 --> 27:19.767
Sit, please, sit.

27:20.013 --> 27:24.018
Can I ask, why were you
so surprised to see us?

27:24.268 --> 27:26.316
I know there are many like me.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.564
Spirit talkers, however you say.

27:28.814 --> 27:29.814
(Charlotte)
There are.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.167
And the good ones in Brentwood

27:31.191 --> 27:32.989
charge 195 an hour.

27:33.235 --> 27:35.533
Not that they wouldn't take
30 grand, don't get me wrong.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.958
Why do you come to me instead?

27:40.200 --> 27:41.600
Well, the others do it
for a living.

27:41.827 --> 27:45.252
They always seem
very much about career.

27:45.497 --> 27:49.252
Um, I... I never
saw my ability

27:49.501 --> 27:52.220
as something with...

27:52.462 --> 27:54.260
with money value, but then...

27:54.506 --> 27:57.601
I did see
your advertisement... Oh!

27:57.843 --> 27:59.060
Whoa.

27:59.303 --> 28:01.271
Forgive me, please,
I'm sorry, I...

28:01.513 --> 28:03.060
It's okay.

28:03.307 --> 28:05.401
Look, I like that you're
not from a hipster office

28:05.642 --> 28:06.939
in Venice Beach.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.106
Everyone else is selling
the dead relative thing,

28:09.313 --> 28:10.815
and I don't want messages.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.158
They don't feel like proof.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.529
Maybe just intuition,
but you're-...

28:16.778 --> 28:19.657
(Speaking Spanish)

28:24.244 --> 28:26.121
<i>Silencio!</i>

28:34.713 --> 28:38.388
Before, when she whispered
to you, what did she say?

28:38.634 --> 28:41.513
She asked if I could
see you, too.

28:41.762 --> 28:44.060
Why would she ask that?

28:44.306 --> 28:46.354
Why do you think?

28:46.600 --> 28:50.025
I'm sorry, I... I should
have offered a drink.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.522
Um, tea?

28:51.772 --> 28:53.695
(Charlotte)
Stop, honey.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.739
You want to tell me
what you're on?

28:55.984 --> 28:58.533
What?

28:58.779 --> 28:59.951
I... I don't...

29:00.197 --> 29:02.620
What drugs you're on.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.914
No.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.255
I don't do that.

29:08.497 --> 29:10.750
Senor, you didn't say
there would be two of you.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.279
Sorry, I was just
trying to help.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.839
Well, she's my mother,
I'm sorry.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.480
She must not be here
for our meditation.

29:15.504 --> 29:17.302
A skeptic looking on
will spoil any chance...

29:17.547 --> 29:19.187
He's a skeptic, too.
That's why he's here.

29:19.383 --> 29:20.805
But he wants to believe.

29:21.051 --> 29:23.019
The difference is everything.

29:27.516 --> 29:28.859
No!

29:29.101 --> 29:30.978
Hey, hey!
Hey!

29:38.819 --> 29:40.742
Th... They are
really bad right now.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.740
They don't like
that you're here.

29:42.990 --> 29:46.620
Do you see more people
in here than I do?

29:46.868 --> 29:49.587
I have many spirits
tethered to me.

29:49.830 --> 29:51.207
You have...

29:51.456 --> 29:54.175
Ghost.
Many ghost.

29:54.418 --> 29:55.937
You never mentioned this
in your video...

29:55.961 --> 29:57.838
I never mentioned.

29:58.088 --> 30:00.511
A haunting is a lonely thing.

30:00.757 --> 30:03.055
No one else can see
what you see,

30:03.302 --> 30:07.978
even the people you love
would call you... crazy.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.975
That's why I never mentioned,

30:10.225 --> 30:13.320
because why tell
what I cannot show?

30:13.562 --> 30:16.156
So you're going to show me
a vision of my own death?

30:16.398 --> 30:17.991
<i>Si.</i>

30:18.233 --> 30:21.203
But not your death in this life.

30:21.445 --> 30:23.994
The last time you died.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.833
How many times have I died?

30:27.075 --> 30:28.873
Closer.

30:29.119 --> 30:30.371
By looking at you,

30:30.620 --> 30:34.625
I think... many.

30:34.875 --> 30:37.253
When does it start?

30:37.502 --> 30:39.129
It's happening already.

30:39.379 --> 30:43.009
Breathe.
I will pass it to you.

30:43.258 --> 30:47.229
Um, this feels
a little intimate.

30:47.471 --> 30:49.644
What you're searching for

30:49.890 --> 30:51.358
is an intimate thing.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.900
Look at me.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.988
(gasps) Oh, my
God, are you okay?

30:57.230 --> 30:58.903
No!
Oh, no, no!

30:59.149 --> 31:01.652
(Speaking Spanish)

31:01.902 --> 31:03.870
They will not allow it.
Oh, my God.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.113
There are so many.

31:05.364 --> 31:08.459
(muttering)

31:08.700 --> 31:09.952
<i>Por favor!</i>

31:10.202 --> 31:12.330
Okay, I think... I think,
I think we're done.

31:12.579 --> 31:13.979
Did she touch you?
What is going on?

31:14.039 --> 31:15.382
Let's just go, let's just go.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.001
(Josephine speaking Spanish)

31:17.250 --> 31:18.627
It's over, hon.
It didn't work.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.424
Who's Bill?
I don't know any Bills.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.513
Yes, Bill.
He's showing me his neck.

31:22.756 --> 31:23.928
He suffocated.

31:24.174 --> 31:26.802
He's warning you
to stop your mission now.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.805
My father was William,
but he didn't suffocate.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.775
He died in car crash,
so I don't know why...

31:32.015 --> 31:33.242
No one called him Bill, no one.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.939
It isn't him, it isn't anyone.

31:35.185 --> 31:36.653
Wait!
Don't go!

31:36.895 --> 31:38.055
I really hope you get better.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.363
Wait!

31:39.606 --> 31:41.483
(horn blaring)

31:47.406 --> 31:49.283
We can see
the third guy tomorrow.

31:52.661 --> 31:56.586
Mr. World-Traveler
Sexy-Phone-Voice lives here?

32:00.293 --> 32:01.795
We're early.

32:03.964 --> 32:06.387
Hey, what are you doing?
That's private.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.226
Looking for butter-scotches.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.345
I don't have any.
Get out of there.

32:15.225 --> 32:17.569
Holy shit!

32:17.811 --> 32:20.109
Is that a tiny gun?

32:20.355 --> 32:21.732
Do you have a tiny gun in here?

32:24.401 --> 32:26.074
Wow.

32:26.319 --> 32:28.037
This would be almost adorable

32:28.280 --> 32:31.250
if it wasn't an instrument
of death in my mother's purse.

32:31.491 --> 32:32.492
It's a purse gun.

32:32.742 --> 32:34.244
What am I supposed to do?
Take shit...

32:34.494 --> 32:35.494
Mom, wait... just...

32:35.620 --> 32:37.372
Hold on a sec, Mom.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.499
(seatbelt unbuckles)

32:42.043 --> 32:43.044
I'll be right back.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.172
Don't shoot anyone.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.522
Brian?

32:54.764 --> 32:56.357
Dude!
Oh!

32:56.600 --> 32:58.227
I haven't seen you
since graduation.

32:58.477 --> 32:59.694
How are you, brother?

32:59.936 --> 33:01.483
I'm, uh, good.
You?

33:01.730 --> 33:02.730
Yeah, I'm good, good.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.066
Great, actually, yeah.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.568
You still doing the...

33:05.817 --> 33:07.170
The special effects, yeah,
I'm still in it.

33:07.194 --> 33:08.366
I got my own little company,

33:08.612 --> 33:10.410
and it's actually
not so little anymore.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.749
So, do you live
around here or just...

33:12.991 --> 33:14.413
Nah, once in a blue moon,

33:14.659 --> 33:16.137
I get the opportunity
to do a real-life set up.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.458
You mean like...

33:17.704 --> 33:19.172
Yeah, real-life
special effects, man.

33:19.414 --> 33:20.586
Real life scares.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.232
I got all my holograms
back in here,

33:22.459 --> 33:24.257
and this guy up the way
is paying some stacks

33:24.503 --> 33:26.722
to do some real crazy stuff.

33:26.963 --> 33:28.931
He's got this small box, right?

33:29.174 --> 33:30.318
He's making it out
to be Tibetan...

33:30.342 --> 33:32.640
It's good to see you.

33:36.264 --> 33:38.141
(munching)

33:41.811 --> 33:45.657
There are 12 still
in the "Maybe" category.

33:45.899 --> 33:48.527
I say we wake up tomorrow,
we make pancakes...

33:48.777 --> 33:50.529
No.

33:50.779 --> 33:52.406
Why keep looking?

33:52.656 --> 33:54.533
I mean...

33:57.577 --> 34:00.080
Be happy.
Hmph.

34:00.330 --> 34:03.584
This is what you wanted to find.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.086
Or not find.
I don't know.

34:13.342 --> 34:16.313
If there's nothing after we die,

34:16.554 --> 34:19.024
well, I guess...

34:19.266 --> 34:23.237
I always liked that it means...

34:23.478 --> 34:24.775
no one's watching.

34:25.021 --> 34:28.900
It means no one's been
watching this whole time.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.275
It means no fate,

34:30.527 --> 34:33.621
no destiny,
no... specific stuff

34:33.862 --> 34:37.036
I was supposed to get done
while I was here.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.581
Best of all...

34:39.828 --> 34:42.251
no one waiting at the end,
you know, to...

34:42.496 --> 34:44.591
judge me.

34:46.876 --> 34:50.346
That's what really
scares me, Miles.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.433
Because, um...

34:53.675 --> 34:55.177
I'm ashamed of more stuff

34:55.427 --> 34:57.521
than I'm proud of.

35:00.140 --> 35:02.268
And I don't want to be
judged, I really don't.

35:02.517 --> 35:05.396
That...
That scares me so bad.

35:07.856 --> 35:11.827
I'd rather it all be a blip
that means nothing to no one.

35:15.905 --> 35:18.784
Because I think I failed.

35:22.579 --> 35:26.049
I know I failed him.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.885
But hey, somewhere
along the way,

35:29.127 --> 35:30.970
I guess your, uh, hope

35:31.212 --> 35:33.510
is kind of catching.

35:36.301 --> 35:39.430
It would be good
to see him again.

36:04.913 --> 36:06.790
(Typing on keyboard)

36:09.084 --> 36:10.301
(Ronald)
<i>Welcome back.</i>

36:10.543 --> 36:12.545

<i>Well, you should.

Oh, come on, come on,

Don't do this.

Hello.

Hello?

(let approaching)

39:51.097 --> 39:54.476
You get used to it!

39:54.726 --> 39:57.775
It's hard to believe.
Do you work here?

39:58.021 --> 40:00.149
Yeah.
I work the runways.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.821
You know, clean the tarmac,
change the light bulbs.

40:03.067 --> 40:06.992
Whatever shit needs doing,
have for years.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.411
Yeah, better not.

40:09.657 --> 40:12.331
I have a sniffle.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.170
Sorry, I'm Nelson.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.689
Tell me how you know
about the woman

40:23.713 --> 40:24.965
in the tape I'm cutting.

40:25.214 --> 40:26.682
I already told you my message.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.302
She told me.

40:28.551 --> 40:29.643
Look, you wouldn't be here

40:29.886 --> 40:31.280
if you didn't sort of
believe me, right?

40:31.304 --> 40:32.656
Is she the ghost
you're gonna show me,

40:32.680 --> 40:33.977
the clock woman?

40:34.223 --> 40:35.223
Oh, no.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.527
She's just someone
I came across.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.988
Look, you'll understand after.

40:40.229 --> 40:42.197
Once you see what
I'm gonna show you,

40:42.440 --> 40:43.566
you're kind of gonna be

40:43.816 --> 40:46.365
in the inner circle
on this thing, and...

40:46.611 --> 40:49.911
well... you'll be
open to it.

40:50.156 --> 40:52.079
To them.

40:52.325 --> 40:56.546
Like, uh, you ever drop acid?

40:56.788 --> 40:58.210
Once.
Yeah.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.209
Then you know.
It's kind of like that.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.881
A door gets opened,

41:03.127 --> 41:06.472
it doesn't get closed again.

41:06.714 --> 41:08.682
You still want to see?

41:11.344 --> 41:13.267
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

41:13.513 --> 41:15.265
I won't survive jail.

41:15.515 --> 41:16.892
Oh, don't worry.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.381
Yeah, no one will come looking.

41:18.434 --> 41:19.434
This is my territory.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.187
I know the ins and outs.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.690
Tell me what's over there first.

41:23.940 --> 41:25.283
You're afraid.

41:25.525 --> 41:26.742
Yes.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.953
Your ad didn't make you
seem like you'd be afraid.

41:29.195 --> 41:30.947
I guess I learned along the way.

41:31.197 --> 41:34.622
Good.
That'll help.

41:34.867 --> 41:36.187
You know, just think
of your lady.

41:36.369 --> 41:39.088
That's what I do.
I think of my Alice.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.628
You ought to meet her, really.

41:44.377 --> 41:46.550
Now you got a lady?

41:46.796 --> 41:48.343
Just tell me what's over there.

41:52.719 --> 41:54.813
That over there
is called Surf Ridge.

41:57.223 --> 42:00.022
In the '30s, like old
Hollywood times, right?

42:00.268 --> 42:02.191
The well-offs came in
and nabbed this spot.

42:02.437 --> 42:04.690
Real nice little
beach community.

42:04.939 --> 42:08.239
Until the baby airstrip next
door started to grow, right?

42:08.484 --> 42:12.830
And now, it's...
wait for it...

42:13.072 --> 42:14.915
LAX!

42:15.158 --> 42:18.082
Yeah, it's jet fuel raining
down, it's walls shaking.

42:18.327 --> 42:20.079
Yeah, they went packing.

42:20.329 --> 42:24.050
Went back to Beverly Hills
or... wherever.

42:24.292 --> 42:26.478
The place weren't worth nothing
to nobody at that point,

42:26.502 --> 42:28.504
so they built a fence,

42:28.755 --> 42:30.803
left it a ghost town.

42:31.049 --> 42:33.393
What houses are left
are used for no good.

42:33.634 --> 42:35.136
I know guys on security detail

42:35.386 --> 42:37.764
don't even bother
snooping around no more.

42:38.014 --> 42:41.564
Let the worst of things
stay in the dark, you know?

42:41.809 --> 42:43.982
Or maybe you don't know.

42:44.228 --> 42:46.856
Eh, maybe me neither.

42:47.106 --> 42:48.733
Maybe sick twists
like you and me

42:48.983 --> 42:50.951
gotta go poking.

43:09.837 --> 43:11.714
That's the place, isn't it?

43:14.759 --> 43:16.727
Yep.

43:16.969 --> 43:19.188
Something taking up in there
that ain't human.

43:19.430 --> 43:20.807
Not nearly.

43:21.057 --> 43:22.775
Not anymore, anyways.

43:26.854 --> 43:29.073
What you thinking?

43:29.315 --> 43:31.363
Honestly?

43:31.609 --> 43:34.112
I'm at like a 68% chance

43:34.362 --> 43:36.990
of being robbed
and killed and raped.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.117
You really brought
the money with you?

43:42.495 --> 43:43.667
Yeah.

43:43.913 --> 43:44.914
You know what?

43:45.164 --> 43:47.542
If this is some sort
of weird stick up,

43:47.792 --> 43:50.762
take the money and...
save me the torture.

43:51.003 --> 43:52.380
I really can't
handle that at all.

43:52.630 --> 43:54.132
Pay what you want.

43:54.382 --> 43:56.055
If you want.

43:56.300 --> 43:58.519
After.

43:58.761 --> 44:01.059
I mean, I just want
to share, you know?

44:01.305 --> 44:03.033
I want to get you into
that inner circle, buddy,

44:03.057 --> 44:05.480
just like you want, okay?

44:05.726 --> 44:08.275
I see you getting your spine.

44:08.521 --> 44:11.900
Whenever get yourself
a lady, like my lady.

44:12.150 --> 44:14.244
Hey, you should meet my lady.
She'd say herself.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.328
You don't got
any worries with me.

44:16.571 --> 44:20.371
All right, I don't got
any guns or knives.

44:20.616 --> 44:24.211
It's not me
you're scared of, huh?

44:24.453 --> 44:25.670
You're scared of that house

44:25.913 --> 44:29.508
and what's inside that house.

44:29.750 --> 44:33.300
You already know this is real.

44:33.546 --> 44:35.423
Is it dangerous?

44:35.673 --> 44:37.550
Depends what you mean.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.677
Better see for yourself.

44:55.151 --> 44:57.870
Might want to hold your nose.

44:58.112 --> 45:00.956
Lots of strays get in and shit
and die and God knows what.

45:01.199 --> 45:03.076
I'm pretty used to it.

45:03.326 --> 45:05.203
It's pretty ripe.

45:14.212 --> 45:16.089
(Miles groans)

45:23.137 --> 45:25.014
Hey.

45:55.294 --> 45:57.547
First door on the left.

45:57.797 --> 45:59.674
That's where he is.

46:05.930 --> 46:08.809
(cat screeches)

46:09.058 --> 46:10.935
Hmm.

46:20.903 --> 46:22.780
Open it.

47:05.156 --> 47:07.079
(chuckles)

47:07.325 --> 47:10.204
(jet passing overhead)

47:38.356 --> 47:41.326
(distorted)
Surprise.

47:41.567 --> 47:43.240
Now we're together.

47:50.493 --> 47:53.372
(plane flying overhead)

48:26.362 --> 48:28.456
(muttering)

48:28.697 --> 48:30.415
Oh, God, oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus.

48:32.410 --> 48:35.289
(jet passing overhead)

48:37.873 --> 48:39.591
(gasping)

48:39.834 --> 48:41.962
Breathe, Miles,
breathe, breathe.

48:42.211 --> 48:44.088
Breathe.

48:59.895 --> 49:02.023
Oh, my God, you're okay.

49:02.273 --> 49:03.525
You're okay.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.254
You're okay,
you're okay, you're okay.

49:05.443 --> 49:08.743
No, you're not.

49:08.988 --> 49:11.616
You look like pure shit.

49:11.866 --> 49:14.585
Do you know a guy named Nelson?

49:14.827 --> 49:17.125
Yeah.

49:17.371 --> 49:19.339
He's in Surf Ridge

49:19.582 --> 49:23.382
in an abandoned house, upstairs.

49:23.627 --> 49:26.506
Tell them that he's dead
in that place.

49:29.383 --> 49:31.351
Oh, dear.

49:33.971 --> 49:36.815
(laughing)

49:47.151 --> 49:49.028
(jet passing overhead)

49:51.405 --> 49:52.622
(engine starts)

49:52.865 --> 49:55.744
(cell phone ringing)

50:03.209 --> 50:05.428
<i>Mom'?
Are you...</i>

50:05.669 --> 50:07.546
(Nelson)
<i>Surprise.</i>

50:23.270 --> 50:26.149
(car radio turns on,
<i>overlapping distorted voices)</i>

50:30.110 --> 50:32.454
(car horn blares)

50:32.696 --> 50:35.575
(voices whispering)

51:06.564 --> 51:10.444
(driver on PA)
<i>Next stop, Robertson.</i>

51:19.618 --> 51:20.835
(distorted screaming)

51:21.078 --> 51:23.831
(inhales deeply)

51:24.081 --> 51:26.755
(driver)
<i>Next stop, Crenshaw.</i>

51:27.001 --> 51:28.594
<i>Crenshaw coming up.</i>

51:28.836 --> 51:32.136
(distorted voices whispering)

51:32.381 --> 51:34.804
Mom! Mom!

51:35.050 --> 51:37.894
Mom?

51:38.137 --> 51:41.391
Mom?

51:41.640 --> 51:43.517
Hi, baby boy...
Oh, Jesus!

51:43.767 --> 51:45.360
Oh!
(Chokes)

51:45.603 --> 51:47.697
You smell horrible!
Mom, wait...

51:47.938 --> 51:50.487
Why do you smell
like shit and rot?

51:50.733 --> 51:54.237
(static distortion)

51:54.486 --> 51:56.659
Mom, shut off the TV, please.

51:56.905 --> 51:58.157
It is off.

51:58.407 --> 52:00.127
Miles, what were you
thinking driving alone?

52:00.159 --> 52:01.376
I'm having...

52:01.619 --> 52:02.721
You can't even walk
down the street by your...

52:02.745 --> 52:03.745
I just saw a dead man...

52:03.787 --> 52:04.806
I don't understand, just...

52:04.830 --> 52:06.298
Listen!

52:06.540 --> 52:07.620
Something terrible happened

52:07.833 --> 52:09.255
and it hasn't stopped happening.

52:09.501 --> 52:10.878
It's still happening.

52:11.128 --> 52:12.675
What's wrong with your eyes?

52:12.921 --> 52:14.399
I see terrible things
at the back of my eyelids

52:14.423 --> 52:16.221
when I...

52:16.467 --> 52:18.765
so I'm trying not to blink.

52:19.011 --> 52:20.697
When I do... please don't
make me think about it,

52:20.721 --> 52:22.189
because then it just happens.

52:22.431 --> 52:25.184
Miles...
somebody dosed you.

52:25.434 --> 52:26.435
What?
Somebody?

52:26.685 --> 52:27.937
Dosed you!
Drugged you!

52:28.187 --> 52:29.313
They did, didn't they?

52:29.563 --> 52:30.883
Somebody... slipped
you something

52:31.023 --> 52:32.303
and made you see God knows what,

52:32.441 --> 52:33.793
and now you're on
a bad trip and...

52:33.817 --> 52:35.660
Hey, Miles, you're
going to be fine.

52:35.903 --> 52:36.995
You are.

52:37.237 --> 52:39.706
You just... you have to
get cleaned up,

52:39.948 --> 52:43.873
and, uh, we'll
take you to a Doctor...

52:44.119 --> 52:47.714
My keys, my car...
where is it?

52:55.881 --> 52:57.474
So, you met a man who...

52:57.716 --> 52:59.514
took you to see his own ghost?

52:59.760 --> 53:01.182
No.

53:01.428 --> 53:03.772
I met a ghost who took me
to see his own dead body.

53:04.014 --> 53:05.654
The man on the voicemail
message we heard,

53:05.766 --> 53:06.766
the unknown caller?

53:06.892 --> 53:07.892
He's not a man.

53:08.018 --> 53:09.440
Not a man, okay.

53:09.687 --> 53:12.031
But, well, he called you, right?

53:12.272 --> 53:14.491
Actually, no.

53:14.733 --> 53:15.733
It never rang.

53:15.859 --> 53:18.112
Never got a missed call.

53:18.362 --> 53:21.491
It was just a message,
so that must mean...

53:21.740 --> 53:23.834
Mr. Grissom.

53:24.076 --> 53:27.580
(distorted hissing scream)

53:27.830 --> 53:30.800
Please, please,
just try to relax, okay?

53:31.041 --> 53:32.213
Oh, my God.
Okay!

53:32.459 --> 53:33.802
Oh, my God, Mom, make it stop!

53:34.044 --> 53:35.591
Make it stop, make it stop.

53:35.838 --> 53:36.898
There's nothing there.
Honey, there's nothing there!

53:36.922 --> 53:39.175
Oh, my God, Mom.

53:39.425 --> 53:42.053
It's not in my blood.
It's not a bad trip, Mom.

53:42.302 --> 53:43.519
I'm haunted!

53:43.762 --> 53:45.059
I'm haunted, he's still here!

53:45.305 --> 53:46.477
I believe you, I believe you.

53:46.724 --> 53:49.227
It isn't drugs,
but it is in you.

53:49.476 --> 53:52.525
Bill was afraid, too.

53:52.771 --> 53:54.239
Bill?

53:54.481 --> 53:57.576
Dad?

53:57.818 --> 53:59.695
You called him that.

54:02.156 --> 54:06.206
What happened to him?

54:06.452 --> 54:08.329
I found him hanging.

54:08.579 --> 54:12.209
After they said he...

54:12.458 --> 54:15.712
suffocated because...

54:15.961 --> 54:17.321
the neck didn't break
how he wanted

54:17.504 --> 54:19.757
when the rope...
when it...

54:20.007 --> 54:21.179
What you never knew

54:21.425 --> 54:25.851
is that your father
was afraid all the time.

54:26.096 --> 54:27.723
Afraid of ghosts?
No.

54:27.973 --> 54:31.694
The world, like you,
when this started.

54:31.935 --> 54:34.905
By then, it was heights
and cars, it was people,

54:35.147 --> 54:38.242
it was fire and water
and it was just...

54:38.484 --> 54:40.657
It was all closing
in around him.

54:40.903 --> 54:43.247
The note he left said to lie.

54:43.489 --> 54:46.163
That... that everyone
should lie.

54:46.408 --> 54:47.705
I think he thought if you knew,

54:47.951 --> 54:50.374
then you'd grow up
expecting it to happen.

54:53.540 --> 54:56.339
She wasn't a fake.

54:56.585 --> 55:00.385
Josefina was the real thing.

55:00.631 --> 55:03.100
Oh, my God.

55:03.342 --> 55:06.721
That was Dad in the room.

55:06.970 --> 55:11.396
He was trying to
tell me something.

55:11.642 --> 55:13.519
He's trying to warn me.

55:19.441 --> 55:21.990
And you lied.

55:22.236 --> 55:24.534
Stop, stop the bus!

55:33.288 --> 55:34.288
How far you going?

55:34.456 --> 55:36.550
Inglewood.

55:36.792 --> 55:37.964
I don't know, man.

55:38.210 --> 55:40.508
He don't exactly look normal.

55:43.382 --> 55:45.476
You have to ride
in the back, fella.

56:01.984 --> 56:03.861
(distorted scream)

56:10.450 --> 56:12.123
Josefina, please!

56:12.369 --> 56:14.997
Sir, we're closed.
You have to go.

56:24.172 --> 56:25.890
Come.

56:37.311 --> 56:40.190
Hey.
(Speaking Spanish)

56:48.780 --> 56:51.875
His toy was stepped on,
and he's not sleepy yet.

56:52.117 --> 56:55.621
But he will fix it, see?

56:55.871 --> 56:57.168
Come on.

57:06.298 --> 57:07.971
Don't let go.

57:08.216 --> 57:10.594
Hey, and sit.

57:10.844 --> 57:11.891
Don't look.

57:12.137 --> 57:15.767
You can relax.

57:16.016 --> 57:17.859
Hey.

57:18.101 --> 57:20.149
Hey.

57:20.395 --> 57:22.944
You're safe.

57:23.190 --> 57:25.113
No.

57:25.359 --> 57:30.365
Look.
Do you see him?

57:30.614 --> 57:32.616
<i>Si.</i>

57:32.866 --> 57:34.709
He's your ghost now,

57:34.952 --> 57:36.670
and he's everywhere you are.

57:36.912 --> 57:39.415
Don't think about him.

57:39.665 --> 57:42.293
I can hold him back for a while.

57:42.542 --> 57:44.419
I know how you suffer.

57:47.381 --> 57:49.258
I know, I know.

57:57.099 --> 57:58.942
He wants to kill me.

57:59.184 --> 58:02.984
The last thing the spirit
wants is to kill you.

58:03.230 --> 58:05.824
He did not intend to die.

58:06.066 --> 58:08.239
If you die, he will
pass with you.

58:12.739 --> 58:14.457
He cannot take you over.

58:14.700 --> 58:16.702
He cannot kill you.

58:16.952 --> 58:20.377
He's tethered to you,
it's what I call it,

58:20.622 --> 58:23.375
but everybody knows about it.

58:23.625 --> 58:25.127
I don't.

58:25.377 --> 58:26.845
Si, you do.

58:27.087 --> 58:31.012
When my Mama passed,
she tethered to my Dad.

58:31.258 --> 58:34.683
She rode along with him
like a passenger in a car.

58:34.928 --> 58:38.398
She rode with him
for a whole month.

58:38.640 --> 58:43.271
And then one day
he felt her just... go.

58:45.522 --> 58:47.570
Just don't die.

58:47.816 --> 58:51.912
Lift off like a balloon.

58:52.154 --> 58:53.576
There's someone in every family

58:53.822 --> 58:57.326
who can tell the same story.

58:57.576 --> 59:02.298
But your ghost was a man
who died unloved.

59:02.539 --> 59:06.009
They need a willing
stranger to attach.

59:06.251 --> 59:10.176
Did he bring you to the body?

59:10.422 --> 59:13.847
I had one that took me
in that way.

59:14.092 --> 59:15.935
So how do I get him off,

59:16.178 --> 59:21.025
or out, or...
untethered?

59:21.266 --> 59:24.816
He must choose to untie,
but he will never do that.

59:25.062 --> 59:26.405
Never?

59:26.646 --> 59:27.926
For him, the Light is like fire.

59:28.148 --> 59:29.775
He will never go in.

59:30.025 --> 59:33.074
Maybe he won't go alone.

59:33.320 --> 59:35.618
What are you saying?

59:39.659 --> 59:42.458
He was in love with a girl.

59:42.704 --> 59:44.752
He told me about her
when we met.

59:44.998 --> 59:46.375
Alice.

59:46.625 --> 59:48.627
He shows her to me sometimes.

59:48.877 --> 59:52.507
I think he wants me to find her.

59:52.756 --> 59:55.851
You know what he's asking for.

59:56.093 --> 59:58.221
Yes.

59:58.470 --> 01:00:01.064
He wants me to kill her,

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.434
so that he can
take her with him.

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.525
Some of my tethers,

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:11.150
they want me to do
terrible things,

01:00:11.399 --> 01:00:15.654
but if you want to
take a life to save your own,

01:00:15.904 --> 01:00:18.748
now your life
is not worth saving.

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:24.204
When I bought that ad,
I was so sure

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:28.755
I'd be glad to find anything.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.895
Now I know a little more
why Mom wants just wants

01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:34.344
to go to sleep at the end.

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:36.512
You haven't heard
the good part yet.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:42.014
What's the good part?

01:00:42.264 --> 01:00:44.141
I will show you.

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:53.942
The ghost who haunts you

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:56.069
is proof only of what happens

01:00:56.319 --> 01:01:00.620
when we are afraid
to leave this world.

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:03.836
But when we finally do,

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:06.671
what happens then
is another story.

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:16.716
It's like home.

01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:19.434
Arms all around you.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:26.854
It's like a whole other memory

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:30.400
that come flooding back,

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:33.569
that was in the tip of
your brain the whole time.

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:45.662
Remember now
what it was like to die...

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:53.127
and what came after.

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:55.253
Wow.

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:11.315
We get to be young again.

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:16.900
Josefina?

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:20.575
What stops you from ending it?

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:25.826
Ending it yourself and just
getting to the good part?

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:29.205
I will never do that.

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:31.422
And neither will you.

01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:33.292
Promise.

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:37.091
If we do that, we miss
the entire point.

01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:40.011
We are not in this life
to be comfortable

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.180
or to be satisfied.

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:45.850
We are here for the adventure.

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:47.973
Got any change?

01:02:52.227 --> 01:02:55.606
God bless you!
I need it badly.

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:57.983
If you got anymore.

01:02:58.233 --> 01:03:00.110
I was in a terrible fire.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.662
Keep it together, dude.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.313
(engine starts)

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:35.688
Keep it together, dude.

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:38.315
Keep it together, dude.

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:40.613
Keep it together, dude.

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:42.736
Keep it together, dude.

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:44.829
Oh, keep it together, dude.

01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:48.666
Keep it together, dude.
Keep it together, dude.

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:49.955
Ahh!
Sorry.

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:52.078
Keep it together, dude.

01:03:57.751 --> 01:03:59.628
(key jangles)

01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:03.886
(tapping on window)

01:04:04.132 --> 01:04:06.009
(door handle jiggles)

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:17.271
Got your car back.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.397
I see that.
Thank you.

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:23.610
Miles...

01:04:28.239 --> 01:04:30.116
I'm sorry.

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:38.383
Did you see her?

01:04:38.625 --> 01:04:41.094
I saw Josefina.

01:04:41.336 --> 01:04:42.804
She could see Nelson.

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:45.640
You mean...
My ghost.

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:47.259
I know you don't
believe a word...

01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:49.182
Nelson Kinny.

01:04:49.427 --> 01:04:51.100
LAX runway worker.

01:04:51.346 --> 01:04:52.768
They found the body.

01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:54.891
It was on the news, and...

01:04:58.937 --> 01:05:01.816
He's here, now, isn't he?

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:05.239
Yes.

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:06.485
Do you see him?

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:08.200
No.

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:11.825
Well, for a second, I thought...

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:16.000
It's because you're
scared now, too.

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:17.589
You're starting to believe me.

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:20.675
I believe you.

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:24.547
I believe you.

01:05:24.796 --> 01:05:26.264
What did she tell you?

01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:29.259
I mean, is there
something we can do to...

01:05:29.509 --> 01:05:31.637
Nothing.

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:34.480
There's nothing.

01:05:34.722 --> 01:05:36.599
(static hissing)

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.773
There is something.

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:44.194
Don't lie to me.

01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:48.196
Miles... tell me
what she said.

01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:59.710
Oh!
I'm sorry.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:00.956
It's okay, it's okay.

01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:02.296
I just...
It's all right.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:04.340
It's just an egg.
I'm going to fix it.

01:06:04.586 --> 01:06:07.089
Here we go, no big deal.

01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:15.727
So, this girl, Alice,

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:18.145
do you think you'd recognize
her face if we have...

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:19.813
Enough.

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:23.654
We're not talking
about her, you promised.

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:25.057
There's only one option here,

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.748
and it's not really
an option, so just...

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.743
Don't tell me
what my options are.

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:38.169
I never hurt anybody on purpose,

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:40.413
but when it comes to my son,

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:41.960
there's no such thing as morals,

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:43.800
no right and wrong.

01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:46.795
I'd personally end innocent
lives by the goddamn dozens

01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:49.389
if it meant...
you could be alive,

01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:52.225
if it meant you could be happy.

01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:53.593
I call that worth it.

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:56.062
I call that being a mother

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:59.478
and having a son.

01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:01.442
(sighs)

01:07:12.403 --> 01:07:13.950
(priest)
The virtuous man,

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:16.996
though he die before
his time, will find rest.

01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:19.336
The length of days

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:21.170
is not what makes age honorable,

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:23.039
nor years
the true measure of life...

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:24.916
(Miles)
How many do you see?

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:27.168
Three plus a priest.

01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:29.921
Not four?

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:32.344
(hissing)

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.843
He has sought to please God,

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:37.095
so God has loved him.

01:07:37.345 --> 01:07:38.614
Your funeral's pathetic, Nelson,

01:07:38.638 --> 01:07:40.936
you sad son of a bitch.

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:43.150
He has been taken up,
he has been carried off

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:45.896
so that evil may not
warp his understanding

01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:47.988
or treachery seduce his soul,

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:49.824
for the fascination of evil

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:51.693
throws good things
into the shade,

01:07:51.943 --> 01:07:53.445
and the whirlwind of desire

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:57.541
corrupts a simple heart.

01:07:57.782 --> 01:08:00.456
Coming to perfection
in so short a time,

01:08:00.702 --> 01:08:02.545
he achieved long life.

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:07.213
His soul being pleasing
to the Lord.

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:08.584
He is taken in quickly

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:12.055
from the wickedness around him.

01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:16.598
It does not enter their heads
that grace and mercy

01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:18.220
await the chosen of the Lord

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:21.348
and protection, his holy ones.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.569
The Lord bless you and keep you.

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:37.162
The Lord make His face
shine upon you

01:08:37.404 --> 01:08:39.282
and be gracious to you.

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:42.627
The Lord lift up
His countenance upon you

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:45.247
and give you peace.

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:37.799
Beautiful service.

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:45.060
(withering chuckle)

01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:46.432
Hmph.

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:48.435
Hmm.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:51.529
You're Alice.

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:53.694
Nelson told me about you.

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:56.363
I'm Miles.
I worked with him.

01:09:56.609 --> 01:09:57.952
YOU?

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:00.697
Greasy runway rat?

01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:02.620
Really?

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:06.022
Nelson described me so damn well

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:07.621
you could spot me like this?

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.964
Yeah.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:13.130
I mean, no.

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:15.970
He had pictures.

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:18.089
He had pictures?

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:22.602
Son of a bitch.

01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:25.597
I'm very sorry for your loss.

01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:27.099
My loss?

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:29.225
I thought you said you knew him.

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:38.617
I did care for him.

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.032
A long time ago.

01:10:43.114 --> 01:10:45.208
This one never did get it
straight in his head

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:48.704
how I'd never feel
what he felt, and...

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:51.081
well, he kept coming.

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:54.425
Never did stop.

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:57.591
Never did stop with
the needles, either.

01:10:57.837 --> 01:10:59.022
When I heard he'd gone missing,

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:01.048
I already had it figured
for an OD'er.

01:11:01.299 --> 01:11:03.347
OD'er?

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:05.687
As in "OD."

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.555
As in oh, dear,
you shot too much shit

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:09.523
and croaked, you stupid asshole.

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:13.524
I'm glad he's gone.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:16.655
I shouldn't say that here.

01:11:23.404 --> 01:11:26.533
I'm glad you're gone.

01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:32.293
You see him?

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:34.757
I... I thought I did.

01:11:39.545 --> 01:11:41.798
Tell me what is happening.

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:43.800
Now.

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:45.643
It's Nelson.
No.

01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:47.808
Look, Alice...
Alice calm down, okay?

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:49.306
Calm down.

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:51.728
Alice, look at me, please.

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.351
Nelson is wherever I go.

01:11:53.601 --> 01:11:56.696
He's haunting me.

01:11:56.938 --> 01:11:58.406
He's my ghost.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:00.070
Make this stop.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.068
He can't hurt you.

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.696
But he wants to, doesn't he?

01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:06.994
Only because he didn't
want to leave...

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.538
and he's scared to go alone.

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:14.247
He wants you to hurt me.

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:17.421
Alice...
Alice, I promise you,

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:19.135
I will live the rest of my life

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:22.301
making sure that Nelson
never gets what he wants.

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:26.684
I promise, you'll be safe.

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:31.931
You can say goodbye to him now.

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:36.106
And you can mean it.

01:12:59.959 --> 01:13:02.212
(whispering indistinctly)

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:25.944
(gun cocks)

01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:29.326
(Click)

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:33.167
(empty chamber clicking)

01:13:42.043 --> 01:13:43.465
(screaming)

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:00.232
(sobbing)

01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:06.822
Mom...

01:14:09.987 --> 01:14:12.456
(sobbing loudly)

01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:23.839
What the hell happens now?

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:27.138
Now?

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:34.053
Now I learn to live
with a ghost.

01:14:37.515 --> 01:14:40.940
Maybe I'll be able to...
sleep through the night

01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:42.562
every now and then.

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:44.940
Maybe I'll be able
to tell the dead ones

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:46.816
from the real ones on my own.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.538
And if I have to drag
Nelson Kinny through my life

01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:59.628
and never give him
what he really wants...

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:01.247
then maybe I can find
a few things

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:03.215
that make him happy.

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:07.587
I'll take him for his
6:00 a.m. walks by the airport,

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:09.839
let him hear the planes.

01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:11.682
I think he likes the sound.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:19.892
If I do that for him...
maybe he'll let me feel normal.

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:21.141
(laughing)

01:15:21.225 --> 01:15:24.946
Just here and there.

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.781
Enough to justify going on.

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:36.244
(gasps)

01:16:00.681 --> 01:16:02.308
Maybe I won't get better.

01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:15.580
If I don't get better, then...

01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:17.118
well...

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.877
If you die,
he will pass with you.

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.858
You're not ready, not yet.

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:50.152
I'll stay
for another day or two.

01:16:50.397 --> 01:16:52.115
Mom, Mom, come on.

01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:53.575
I'm ready.

01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:55.286
Okay?

01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:57.155
(sighs)

01:16:57.404 --> 01:16:58.576
I have to try.

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:06.005
Oh, um, will you drop this off
for me on your way out of town?

01:17:20.553 --> 01:17:23.102
Look, call to say
you made it fine.

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.651
(engine starts)

01:17:49.206 --> 01:17:51.129
(clanking)

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:54.504
Excuse me, is Josefina here?

01:17:54.753 --> 01:17:56.130
She can't see you today.

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:57.941
I have something I need
to give to her in person.

01:17:57.965 --> 01:17:59.342
It's very important.

01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:03.062
Josefina is very bad
with spirit today.

01:18:03.304 --> 01:18:05.352
I understand, but, um...

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:13.609
<i>Muy importante.</i>

01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:15.073
<i>Si.</i>

01:18:15.316 --> 01:18:18.115
Come with us.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.828
Thank you.

01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:36.213
(airplane whooshing)

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:01.324
You looking for me...
or him?

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:05.457
You.

01:19:05.699 --> 01:19:08.327
I was hoping not to see him.

01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:12.877
I was thinking...

01:19:13.123 --> 01:19:16.673
well, I was feeling
sorry for you.

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:17.966
Really?

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:23.593
Well, I guess you are
the only one who has any idea

01:19:23.842 --> 01:19:25.442
what it's like to have
Nelson on your ass

01:19:25.636 --> 01:19:27.229
every second of the day.

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:30.475
I've actually been
back there a few times.

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:33.193
To the grave.

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.733
Really?
Yeah.

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:38.153
Justâ€œ I don't know,

01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:41.073
talk to him, you know?

01:19:41.318 --> 01:19:43.241
Make a bit of peace.

01:19:44.655 --> 01:19:47.204
I told him he should let you go.

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:50.373
Told him I liked you
and you seem decent to me.

01:19:52.663 --> 01:19:54.711
Wish it had worked.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:02.139
You got a lady
in your life, Miles?

01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:04.258
(airplane whooshing)

01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:18.655
<i>SeÃ±ora...</i>

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:21.025
your visitor is back.

01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:25.492
Bill... he is
showing me his neck,

01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:28.287
where he hung from the rope.

01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:29.532
He's...

01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:32.086
He's here?

01:20:36.623 --> 01:20:38.421
Bill?

01:20:46.258 --> 01:20:48.260
I can feel him.

01:20:50.637 --> 01:20:54.858
What is he... please,
tell me what he's saying.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.228
He say you turn around.

01:20:57.478 --> 01:20:58.855
Turn around?

01:20:59.104 --> 01:21:03.951
You turn your car around
and go back to your son!

01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:06.195
Go! Go now!

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:10.036
(grunting)

01:21:12.076 --> 01:21:13.544
(whispering)
Oh, my God.

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:16.505
Oh, Jesus...
I'm so sorry.

01:21:16.747 --> 01:21:18.841
I would have never hurt you.

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:21.177
No, you would.

01:21:21.418 --> 01:21:23.216
You don't get it.

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:25.590
Nelson, he wears you down.

01:21:25.839 --> 01:21:27.056
That's what he does.

01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:30.553
And eventually you'd have come.

01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:33.807
I can't take
that chance, damn it.

01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:35.854
I have a boy now.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:39.195
I had a boy with another man,

01:21:39.436 --> 01:21:41.359
and Nelson was so angry,

01:21:41.605 --> 01:21:44.654
he told me he'd
bury my baby alive.

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:47.653
He said that... and...

01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:53.000
Jesus, a mother
has to do something.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:55.495
So I told him we could go
get high at the ghost town,

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:57.621
like the old days.

01:22:04.962 --> 01:22:08.967
And I tainted his dose...
shot up three needles full.

01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:19.894
(screaming)

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:22.855
I had to.

01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:31.284
(airplane whooshing)

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:37.962
You gotta take him
out of here for good now.

01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:40.126
Okay?

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:44.502
(weakly)
I will.

01:22:46.003 --> 01:22:47.846
God bless you.

01:22:54.428 --> 01:22:55.771
Nelson?

01:22:56.013 --> 01:22:58.186
Do you hear me in there?

01:23:00.684 --> 01:23:02.186
Burn in hell.

01:23:03.687 --> 01:23:06.736
(whispering)
There ls no hell.

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:11.954
(airplane whooshing)

01:23:31.924 --> 01:23:34.068
(Young Charlotte) I think that
Miles has to come with me today

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:35.514
because he's so good at finding

01:23:35.761 --> 01:23:37.809
all the buttons on
the floor, so I need him.

01:23:38.055 --> 01:23:39.602
I need him today
at the dry-cleaners.

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:42.271
Uh-huh, that's good,
that's good, that's good.

01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:43.610
I need him at work today

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:45.320
because he reattaches
my knee pads

01:23:45.562 --> 01:23:47.235
every time I finish
with my lunch break.

01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:49.734
He's the perfect height to
put those knee pads back on.

01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:51.326
Yeah, I need him at work today.

01:23:51.568 --> 01:23:53.787
Miles is the only one
who speaks Spanish.

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:55.281
That's ridiculous, I win.

01:23:55.531 --> 01:23:56.657
(laughing)

01:23:56.907 --> 01:23:58.955
Why don't we let him decide, Bill?
Mm.

01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:02.375
Okay, Miles,
time to make a choice.

01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:05.340
Do you want to go
with Dad today, or with Mom?

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:09.712
What'll it be?
Mom or Dad?

01:24:09.962 --> 01:24:10.962
Mama!

01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:12.847
(giggling)

01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:14.090
Pulse check.

01:24:14.174 --> 01:24:15.642
(coughing and gasping)

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:18.137
There we go.
We got him.

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:19.513
(police radio chatter)

01:24:19.763 --> 01:24:21.436
(coughing)
Oh, God.

01:24:21.682 --> 01:24:22.934
Thank you, thank you.

01:24:24.268 --> 01:24:26.316
Mama...

01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:27.779
I died.

01:24:28.021 --> 01:24:30.615
But you came back to me, kid.

01:24:30.857 --> 01:24:32.951
And I came back alone.

01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:40.869

01:24:46.081 --> 01:24:47.424

(cell phone ringing)

01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:18.868
