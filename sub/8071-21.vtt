00:09.677 --> 00:11.445
Oh jeez, Colonel
Klink is definitely

00:11.545 --> 00:14.715
going to the Russian front
for this wacky foul up.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.050
You'd think they
figured it out

00:16.150 --> 00:18.086
that Hogan could hear all
their secret plans after, like,

00:18.186 --> 00:21.021
1,000 episodes.
- Forget that.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.356
After the second
episode you think

00:22.456 --> 00:23.624
they'd realize they
should be speaking

00:23.724 --> 00:24.525
to each other in German.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.462
You want a soda?

00:28.562 --> 00:30.564
Yeah, sure.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.400
Oh jeez, now they're
playing volleyball.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.267
What is this?

00:33.367 --> 00:34.702
Like the Nazi Club Med?

00:37.471 --> 00:38.572
Here you go.

00:38.672 --> 00:41.041
Thanks.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.811
Tell your mom
you're out of chips.

00:43.911 --> 00:45.613
Let's see what else is on.

00:48.716 --> 00:49.517
Let's watch this.

00:53.854 --> 00:56.090
What are you doing?

00:56.190 --> 00:59.593
That was not the
reaction I was hoping for.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.862
Well, David, we're,
like, really good friends.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.631
So?

01:03.731 --> 01:07.168
So I don't think you should
cop a cheap feel from a friend.

01:07.268 --> 01:10.604
Hey, my hand is way out of
copping range here, Darlene.

01:10.704 --> 01:11.505
Move it.

01:11.605 --> 01:12.706
OK.

01:12.806 --> 01:13.907
I don't believe this.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.209
Why not?

01:15.309 --> 01:16.844
The whole school thing we're
boyfriend and girlfriend.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.279
So what?

01:18.379 --> 01:19.380
So what did I do, anyway?

01:19.480 --> 01:21.182
I put my arm around you.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.151
- Well, yeah, and what was next?
- God, I don't know.

01:23.251 --> 01:24.618
It took me three
weeks to get to that.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.122
Oh, gross.

01:28.222 --> 01:30.891
You've been planning this?

01:30.991 --> 01:32.826
This is the lowest
moment of my entire life.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.829
Thanks for being a part of it.

01:35.929 --> 01:36.964
Look, I'm sorry.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.832
You caught me off guard.

01:38.932 --> 01:42.270
I-- I just don't know
if see you that way.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.638
Becky!

01:44.738 --> 01:47.975
Next time you let your car
hog up the driveway like that,

01:48.075 --> 01:51.212
I'm getting it towed
to Indianapolis!

01:51.312 --> 01:52.313
She's not here.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.748
Dana picked her up, and
they went somewhere.

01:54.848 --> 01:58.018
Oh, well, it's
not that important.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.954
I'm sure she hear
you anyway, dear.

02:01.054 --> 02:01.889
- Hey, David.
- Hey.

02:01.989 --> 02:02.923
You know, you're out of those--

02:03.023 --> 02:03.924
Here you go.

02:04.024 --> 02:04.892
Oh, thanks.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.498
I'm gonna get out of here.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.233
You don't have to.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.133
Yeah, I do.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.612
Yeah, so, just cause
Rodbells is missing some stuff,

02:24.712 --> 02:25.879
you know, everybody
has to take, like,

02:25.979 --> 02:28.249
some stupid lie detector test.

02:28.349 --> 02:29.483
Well, don't take it.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.219
They can't fire
you if you refuse.

02:31.319 --> 02:32.286
Oh, yeah, they can.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.955
They just wouldn't
say that that was why.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.758
You know, they'd say it was
cause I was always late.

02:37.858 --> 02:41.161
Or cause I was rude
to the customers.

02:41.262 --> 02:44.832
They'd find some
tiny, little thing.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.367
What kind of stuff got stolen?

02:46.467 --> 02:47.501
They didn't even tell us.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.637
Well you don't have
anything to worry about.

02:49.737 --> 02:50.638
But that's just the point.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.440
I didn't take
anything, you know?

02:52.540 --> 02:55.543
And I really resent Rodbells
treating me like I'm

02:55.643 --> 02:57.311
some common criminal, you know?

03:04.485 --> 03:07.087
I'm going to the big house, Dan.

04:16.424 --> 04:19.793
[music playing]

04:21.429 --> 04:23.096
Well, I don't know
how this happened.

04:23.196 --> 04:25.399
But suddenly, ladies,
we are overstocked

04:25.499 --> 04:30.571
with half empty jars of
mustard and mayonnaise.

04:30.671 --> 04:31.805
Anybody have anything to say?

04:35.376 --> 04:37.345
Uh, All right.

04:37.445 --> 04:42.115
Uh, Leon, I took some things
home from the restaurant.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.651
I know it's illegal,
and I'm sorry.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.753
That's why I brought them back.

04:45.853 --> 04:49.423
Bonnie, don't you think I
noticed that you leave here

04:49.523 --> 04:52.826
lumpier than when you come in?

04:52.926 --> 04:55.729
Now, I have always tried
to look the other way

04:55.829 --> 04:57.064
when you've taken condiments.

04:57.164 --> 05:01.034
But how can I do that if you
keep on bringing them back?

05:01.134 --> 05:03.471
Well, I'm sorry.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.238
Well, I figured if I
brought them back then when

05:05.339 --> 05:06.874
they asked me if
I stole anything I

05:06.974 --> 05:10.177
could just say I borrowed them.

05:10.277 --> 05:13.080
You're not going to
bust her, are you, Leon?

05:13.180 --> 05:14.314
Course not.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.517
Well, then can you give
me a hand cause I got a vat

05:16.617 --> 05:18.185
of steak sauce out in my car.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.756
Roseanne, I hate
to burst your bubble,

05:22.856 --> 05:25.493
but your little plan
isn't gonna work.

05:25.593 --> 05:29.129
You see, once you believe
that you've stolen something

05:29.229 --> 05:31.031
it'll show up on the polygraph.

05:31.131 --> 05:34.668
Yeah, but like she said,
we-- we were just borrowing it.

05:34.768 --> 05:37.204
Yeah, but you
borrowed a full jar.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.106
And when you brought it
back it was half empty.

05:39.206 --> 05:43.444
Now don't you believe
that that was stealing?

05:43.544 --> 05:44.645
Well, I do now.

05:44.745 --> 05:45.913
Thanks to you.

05:46.013 --> 05:49.550
Yeah, way to go, Leon.

05:49.650 --> 05:50.451
Hey.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.686
Hey.

05:52.786 --> 05:53.587
You got a few minutes?

05:53.687 --> 05:54.588
Yeah, sure.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.190
My break doesn't
start for a half hour.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.593
Well, I was thinking.

05:59.693 --> 06:03.130
Did Darlene tell you about
what happened last night?

06:03.230 --> 06:04.965
Of course.

06:05.065 --> 06:08.569
Well, I thought, maybe,
we should talk about it.

06:08.669 --> 06:12.105
OK, well, do you want
some pie or something?

06:16.143 --> 06:19.346
Isn't that Darlene's
little boyfriend?

06:19.447 --> 06:21.549
Darlene doesn't
have a boyfriend.

06:21.649 --> 06:24.284
And, yes.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.686
Well, what'd he mean by that?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.020
What happened last night?

06:27.120 --> 06:27.921
I don't know.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.289
Darlene never tells me a thing.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.294
Well, here you go.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.529
Thanks.

06:35.629 --> 06:36.564
OK, we'll talk.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.566
You start.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.668
Well, Mark said
that you were always

06:40.768 --> 06:43.036
trashing on him to Becky, and
that's why she broke up with.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.705
Ugh, come on, David.

06:44.805 --> 06:45.906
No, no no, hold it.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.407
I'm not like my brother, OK?

06:47.508 --> 06:49.610
I think Mark is the
biggest jerk on the planet.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.211
And you were
absolutely right to try

06:51.311 --> 06:52.813
to keep him away from Becky.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.783
Hmm, you're sucking up.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.118
That's better.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.820
So, I guess I'm
just asking you

06:59.920 --> 07:02.923
not to sink me with Darlene.

07:03.023 --> 07:06.393
So I'm just supposed to forget
about what happened last night.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.294
Is that it?

07:07.394 --> 07:08.195
What?

07:08.295 --> 07:09.129
Nothing happened.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.097
I put my arm around her.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.465
That's all.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.701
What did she tell you?

07:13.801 --> 07:16.269
I really can't
tell you that, David.

07:16.369 --> 07:20.674
Uh, but I will tell
you this, Darlene

07:20.774 --> 07:24.177
is a lot like I was when I
first started dating Mr. Conner,

07:24.277 --> 07:25.145
you know?

07:25.245 --> 07:28.582
Oh, we took it real
slow, you know?

07:28.682 --> 07:31.084
Cause that's what I
needed at the time.

07:31.184 --> 07:36.089
I mean, it was years
before anything happened.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.457
Got it?

07:37.558 --> 07:38.358
Yeah, I got it.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.298
Bring on the lie detector.

07:45.398 --> 07:48.769
[music playing]

07:50.738 --> 07:51.539
I don't know.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.641
He's still Mark's brother.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.009
Totally different kid, Dan.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.845
Mark is obnoxious.

07:57.945 --> 07:58.779
He's rude.

07:58.879 --> 07:59.847
He's going nowhere.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.915
And he's too old for Becky.

08:02.015 --> 08:05.318
On the other hand,
David likes me.

08:05.418 --> 08:06.987
Where's the mustard?

08:07.087 --> 08:08.956
I took it back to Rodbells.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.223
What about the salami?

08:10.323 --> 08:11.124
I told you, Dan.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.359
I took everything back.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.895
But the-- the salami was ours.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.264
ROSEANNE: I panicked!

08:17.364 --> 08:20.333
I've been forward to that
salami ever since dinner.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.405
Dad?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.374
Uh, you want to go
shoot some hoops?

08:31.679 --> 08:32.512
You mean, your dad?

08:35.616 --> 08:37.084
Well, just a quick game.
No big deal.

08:37.184 --> 08:37.985
Sure.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.158
OK, Conner, no time
left on the clock.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.426
Your team is down by a point.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.761
It's all up to you.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.164

Darlene, Darlene.

08:51.264 --> 08:54.501
Ooh.
- God, I'm shooting like a girl.

08:54.602 --> 08:55.969
Nah, you're just
a little rusty.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.004
You'll get it back.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.005
Here, put it up.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.640
Try it again.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.444
Girly girly.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.748
Gee, I forgot how much
fun it was to play with you.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.249
Come on, put it up.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.021
You know, Dad, I
really just want to talk.

09:14.121 --> 09:14.922
I knew it.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.693
What's up?

09:19.793 --> 09:24.097
Well, I need a guy's
opinion about something.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.700
OK, I'll be the guy.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.670
All right, um, let's say
that you were real good friends

09:29.770 --> 09:31.204
with this girl.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.974
And you made a move on her,
and she turned you down.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.375
What would you do?

09:35.475 --> 09:38.345
Why, then I'd applaud
her high moral standards.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.217
Well, that's a dad opinion.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.653
I need a guy opinion.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.354
An honest one.

09:47.454 --> 09:48.789
I'd run and tell all
my buddies I scored.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.895
No, I meant would you
still be friends with her?

09:54.995 --> 09:58.165
Oh, well, maybe.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.534
Well, even if you're
still attracted to her?

10:01.635 --> 10:04.571
Well, then I'd try again.

10:04.672 --> 10:05.773
So it'd always
be on your mind.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.508
So you couldn't just,
like, hang out with her.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.510
Is this about you and David?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.279
Let's just say I'm curious,
and leave it at that.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.180
OK.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.117
So?

10:17.217 --> 10:22.289
Listen, Darlene, what I would
do, or what Mr. X would do,

10:22.389 --> 10:24.658
is, like, not the point.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.527
You're asking me what
you should do, right?

10:27.627 --> 10:28.528
Yeah, I guess.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.398
Well, let me put it this way.

10:31.498 --> 10:34.668
You have never in your
life done anything

10:34.768 --> 10:36.003
just to please somebody else.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.909
Why start now?

10:42.009 --> 10:43.176
Cool.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.278
Play ball!

10:45.378 --> 10:48.749
[music playing]

10:59.259 --> 11:00.060
Thanks, Dad.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.929
Anytime.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.163
Thanks for what?

11:03.263 --> 11:05.532
Well, she just came to
the old man for some advice.

11:07.801 --> 11:08.668
Yeah?

11:08.769 --> 11:10.437
What, she talked
to you about David?

11:10.537 --> 11:12.105
Well, it was steeped in
the hypothetical, dear.

11:12.205 --> 11:16.576
But she basically confirmed
that he's warm for her form.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.946
Well that's just great.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.247
I know.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.982
But you knew she was gonna
start with boys again.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.084
And look at it this way,
she didn't go up and hide

11:24.184 --> 11:25.652
in her room or anything.

11:25.753 --> 11:28.588
She did exactly what
you wanted her to do.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.489
She came to us.

11:35.595 --> 11:38.932
You just don't
get it, do you, Dan?

11:39.032 --> 11:42.102
When I said us, I meant me!

11:42.202 --> 11:43.603
[door slams]

11:43.703 --> 11:47.107
[music playing]

11:54.681 --> 11:58.085
[phone ringing]

11:59.286 --> 12:00.087
Hello?

12:00.187 --> 12:01.254
Oh, hey, David.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.490
Hang on one second.

12:03.590 --> 12:04.724
Uh, David, Darlene's
in the shower.

12:04.825 --> 12:05.625
Yeah.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.929
Well, I'll tell her you called.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.197
OK, she'll see you at school.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.298
Bye.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.365
Why'd you have to say shower?

12:12.465 --> 12:13.500
Now he's picturing me naked.

12:16.703 --> 12:21.741
Well, then I'm sure he won't
be bothering you anymore.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.143
What am I going to say to him?

12:23.243 --> 12:27.214
I just know he's going to want
to sit next to me in detention.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.281
What's the big deal?

12:28.381 --> 12:30.317
You either go out with
him, or you don't.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.620
Yeah, and then if we do,
like, everything changes.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.790
Yeah, but it could be better.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.592
I mean, don't you
want to kiss him?

12:39.692 --> 12:40.961
Uh-huh.

12:41.061 --> 12:41.962
Really?

12:42.062 --> 12:42.863
Yeah, really.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.431
OK?

12:44.531 --> 12:46.599
Well, you having
dreams about it?

12:46.699 --> 12:48.235
No.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.804
Well, yeah.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.772
But I woke up at the good part.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.774
Yeah, and then you tried to
go back to sleep real quick

12:54.875 --> 12:56.676
so you can get right
back into it, right?

12:56.776 --> 12:57.811
Yeah, but it wasn't the same.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.446
All of a sudden everybody
had really big heads

12:59.546 --> 13:02.816
and we were all talking
about spaghetti.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.117
Well, I don't know, Darlene.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.718
If I were you, I'd go for it.

13:05.819 --> 13:08.055
Yeah, but then what if we do,
and then what if we break up?

13:08.155 --> 13:10.490
Then I lose, like, the
best friend I ever had.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.092
Well, things have
already changed, Darlene.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.661
You can't go back.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.997
Well hey, he left it up to me.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.465
I mean, if I want,
then I can decide

13:18.565 --> 13:21.134
that we'll just be friends.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.602
Good, guys love that.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.176
DJ, let's go.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.410
I'll see you tonight, Dad.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.378
You going to drive Darlene?

13:31.478 --> 13:32.745
Nah, she walked.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.447
She's got a lot to think about.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.683
Oh, yeah.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.118
She talk to you about David?
- Yeah.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.152
Yeah, me too.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.287
Think she's gonna
go out with him?

13:40.387 --> 13:41.754
I don't think she knows yet.

13:41.855 --> 13:42.789
But I-- I think she's gonna.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.191
Yeah.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.758
Well, I think it's really great
you guys are talking about this

13:45.859 --> 13:47.494
because I'm only
good for guy stuff.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.029
Yeah, well, I think
she just needs, like,

13:49.129 --> 13:51.331
the female viewpoint from
someone who's, you know,

13:51.431 --> 13:53.300
a little older.

13:53.400 --> 13:57.404
This is really ticking me off!

13:57.504 --> 13:59.339
I can't believe you're
jealous over this.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.240
Why not?

14:00.340 --> 14:01.808
It's very typical of me.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.210
OK.
You called.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.012
I rushed right over.
What so important?

14:05.112 --> 14:08.315
Uh-huh, I'm talking
to Dan right now.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.583
OK, next time one of
the kids has a problem

14:10.683 --> 14:11.985
I'll send them directly to you.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.853
This is the problem I wanted.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.222
And you hogged it!

14:18.091 --> 14:18.926
I'm ready.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.260
What took you so long?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.162
I'm supposed to wear
this for gym today,

14:22.262 --> 14:23.663
and I don't how to put it on.

14:29.602 --> 14:30.403
Sounds like a problem.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.949
Want to field this one, honey?

14:42.049 --> 14:42.916
Get out of here.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.085
Come on, DJ.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.988
I can't believe you're
still mad because Darlene

14:48.088 --> 14:49.990
went to Dan instead of you.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.292
Well, she didn't just
go did Dan, you know?

14:52.392 --> 14:53.760
She went Becky, too.

14:53.860 --> 14:57.030
Ooh, she went to her
older sister for advice.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.699
Never worked for me.

14:59.799 --> 15:00.800
Shut up.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.703
Look, the important
thing is that Darlene

15:03.803 --> 15:05.538
got what she needed, right?

15:05.638 --> 15:06.573
Fine.

15:06.673 --> 15:10.177
OK then, so, what
do you need me for?

15:10.277 --> 15:17.117
Well OK, you know I took
this stuff from the restaurant,

15:17.217 --> 15:18.251
right?

15:18.351 --> 15:19.852
Well I know now it was
wrong and everything.

15:19.953 --> 15:20.820
And I made a mistake.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.122
And I feel really bad about it.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.490
You know, I can't stop
thinking about it.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.658
I feel really bad about it.

15:25.758 --> 15:30.230
So my question to you
is, what are the chances

15:30.330 --> 15:33.800
of beating a lie detector?

15:33.900 --> 15:35.502
You're actually gonna lie?

15:35.602 --> 15:37.537
Well, If I tell the
truth I'm gonna get fired.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.240
And If I lie, at
least I got a shot.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.509
I sort of figured, you know,
being a cop and everything,

15:42.609 --> 15:44.444
maybe you'd know
some of the tricks.

15:44.544 --> 15:45.678
There are no tricks!

15:45.778 --> 15:47.880
It's a machine!

15:47.981 --> 15:50.850
I can beat it.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.021
The test measures blood
pressure, heart rate,

15:54.121 --> 15:55.088
respiration.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.457
These are things that
you can't control.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.127
I think I can.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.495
The only ones that can
beat a lie detector test

16:02.595 --> 16:04.964
are people that have,
like, no conscience at all.

16:05.065 --> 16:08.235
Psychos, schizos,
pathological liars.

16:12.939 --> 16:14.674
I know I can.

16:14.774 --> 16:18.011
[music playing]

16:20.480 --> 16:22.849
Man, it's really hot in here.

16:22.949 --> 16:23.816
What if I get all sweaty?

16:23.916 --> 16:25.518
Will I get electrocuted?

16:25.618 --> 16:29.222
No, Mrs. Conner, there
is absolutely no danger.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.058
Well, how's this work, anyway?

16:31.158 --> 16:33.360
If those needles start
jumping all over the place,

16:33.460 --> 16:35.328
then that's how you
know I'm lying, right?

16:35.428 --> 16:39.299
Do you plan on
lying, Mrs. Conner?

16:39.399 --> 16:41.468
- No.
- Oh, it's not on yet.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.474
OK, here we go.

16:47.574 --> 16:50.077
Now, just concern yourself
with the questions,

16:50.177 --> 16:52.612
and try to remain relaxed.

16:52.712 --> 16:53.713
Okey-dokey.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.448
State your name, please.

16:55.548 --> 16:56.649
Roseanne Conner.

16:56.749 --> 16:57.750
Your age?

16:57.850 --> 16:59.386
38-- 39.

16:59.486 --> 17:02.489
Uh-huh, occupation?

17:02.589 --> 17:03.756
Waitress.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.558
Have you ever stolen any
merchandise from Rodbells?

17:08.895 --> 17:09.962
Well--

17:10.063 --> 17:11.164
Yes or no, Mrs. Conner.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.933
Well, I mean, can't you
start off, like, smaller?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.268
And maybe more specific?

17:15.368 --> 17:17.270
Like, you know,
going, like, OK--

17:17.370 --> 17:20.073
have I ever stolen
a giant screen TV?

17:20.173 --> 17:21.241
No.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.643
A hose from garden supply?

17:23.743 --> 17:25.378
No.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.746
A canoe--

17:26.846 --> 17:30.049
Yeah, have you
ever taken anything?

17:30.150 --> 17:32.819
Well hey, how about
that pen you got there?

17:32.919 --> 17:34.621
I bet you took that
from your work.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.523
Yes, and I'm working with it.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.727
Oh.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.662
Now, Mrs. Conner, have
you ever taken anything?

17:42.762 --> 17:44.764
Yes or no, please.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.099
Yes, please.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.668
What have you taken?

17:48.768 --> 17:54.507
Uh, ketchup,
mustard, pickle chips,

17:54.607 --> 17:57.277
what's gonna happen to me?

17:57.377 --> 17:58.511
That's management's decision.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.980
I just asked the questions.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.682
Now, have you ever
stolen any cash?

18:02.782 --> 18:03.950
Absolutely not.

18:04.050 --> 18:06.319
Ah, how about your coworkers?

18:06.419 --> 18:07.220
Bonnie?

18:07.320 --> 18:08.655
No.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.624
Actually, I was
talking about Leon Carp.

18:11.724 --> 18:12.659
Leon?

18:12.759 --> 18:13.793
How come?

18:13.893 --> 18:15.228
Bonnie's the one that
has the police record.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.201
Uh-huh.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.536
Well, have you ever seen
Mr. Carp take any cash

18:23.636 --> 18:24.737
from the register?

18:24.837 --> 18:26.072
Well yeah, because he
does the books, you know?

18:26.173 --> 18:27.440
That's his job.

18:27.540 --> 18:31.043
Well, have you observed any
changes in his normal routine?

18:31.144 --> 18:32.245
No.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.813
Have you seen him exhibit
any unusual behavior?

18:36.483 --> 18:40.787
Oh, I know what
this is all about.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.356
You're trying to scrounge
up some dirt on Leon

18:43.456 --> 18:46.025
just because he's gay.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.595
Well, I ought to call
the ACLU because this

18:48.695 --> 18:50.563
is totally un-American.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.031
And I'm not going
to give you any help

18:52.131 --> 18:53.400
in your little witch hunt.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.934
No crappy job is worth that.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.008
You did know he
was gay, didn't ya?

19:04.677 --> 19:06.579
No.

19:06.679 --> 19:07.614
Well, he's not.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.953
[music playing]

19:18.891 --> 19:20.059
Hey.

19:20.159 --> 19:20.960
How's it going?

19:21.060 --> 19:22.094
You still got a job?

19:22.195 --> 19:23.530
Oh, what does it matter?

19:23.630 --> 19:25.265
I can't ever go
back there again.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.233
How come?

19:26.333 --> 19:27.967
Oh, cause I cracked.

19:28.067 --> 19:30.370
I turned myself in, then I
ratted out all my friends.

19:35.242 --> 19:38.645
Sounds like you
had a full day.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.146
Where's Darlene?

19:40.247 --> 19:43.015
Last time I saw her, she
was out shooting hoops.

19:43.115 --> 19:45.252
Well, I've decided that
she's going to confide in me

19:45.352 --> 19:47.287
if I have to rip it out of her.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.562
Dan, come here!

19:59.566 --> 20:01.968
So then how come you
never return my calls?

20:02.068 --> 20:03.603
All right, I was
avoiding you because I

20:03.703 --> 20:05.171
didn't know what to say.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.506
It's easy, you want
to go out with me?

20:06.606 --> 20:08.408
Yes or no.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.609
And then we stop
being friends.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.978
And it become something
totally different.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.480
So then your answer is no.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.914
And now we're not
friends anymore, right?

20:15.014 --> 20:15.815
No.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.717
Look, I was ready for this.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.887
I can't help liking
you that way.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.122
But I'll deal with it, you know?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.892
I'd rather be
friends than nothing.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.360
OK.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.261
OK.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.066
So, I got a couple bucks, want
to go down to the arcade and--

20:47.079 --> 20:50.016
What, exactly, did
you tell her, Dan?

20:52.552 --> 20:53.620
I don't know.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.422
I just listened and tried
to be there for her.

20:55.522 --> 20:56.923
That's all.

20:57.023 --> 21:00.259
Brilliant!

21:00.360 --> 21:03.730
[music playing]

21:07.767 --> 21:10.002
Absolutely not.

21:10.102 --> 21:15.074
Roseanne Conner is not a danger
to herself or the customers.

21:15.174 --> 21:18.711
To the best of your knowledge,
is she on any medication?

21:18.811 --> 21:20.513
No.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.550
But I think she should be.

21:23.650 --> 21:27.153
So you consider
her a good employee?

21:27.253 --> 21:29.789
Well now, that that's a poser.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.023
Yes or no, Mr. Carp.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.729
