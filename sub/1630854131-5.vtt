WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:05.406
**

00:05.439 --> 00:07.441
Did Paige get back
to New York okay?

00:07.475 --> 00:08.476
She sure did.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.678
Luke thinks you're still
suspicious about him.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.246
Look, your mum's
arriving tomorrow.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.515
She thinks we're up here
riding horses, having fun,

00:14.548 --> 00:16.650
not looking into
some disappearance.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.619
Ren Bhullar said you might be
able to help me

00:18.652 --> 00:20.288
with a problem my boss has.

00:20.321 --> 00:23.391
Something was taken from him
and he wants it back.

00:23.424 --> 00:27.495
Deliver them to us, and you
will be very well compensated.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.763
-I located the targets.
-Where are they?

00:29.797 --> 00:30.798
DONNO: Camping trip.

00:30.831 --> 00:33.234
I have always wanted
to go camping.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.636
So, uh, what are we looking for?

00:35.669 --> 00:37.471
**

00:37.505 --> 00:40.308
It's Mark Woodman,
our missing backpacker.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.743
That boy is gonna be the end
of you someday, Sunny.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.179
**

00:45.213 --> 00:46.647
I love you, Walter.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.950
**

00:49.983 --> 00:51.552
They're gone.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.959
Why didn't you
scream for help?

00:58.992 --> 01:00.428
I don't know who
any of you people are.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.632
What would've happened
if I did scream?

01:04.665 --> 01:06.134
WALTER: Nothing good.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.336
My mom told everyone
you went home.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.671
Your mom...

01:10.704 --> 01:11.972
is Sunny?

01:12.005 --> 01:13.674
Yes.

01:13.707 --> 01:17.077
Why is Sunny
keeping you out here?

01:17.111 --> 01:19.147
To protect me
from other people.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.449
And the police.

01:23.684 --> 01:28.021
(exhales shakily)
Okay, a lot to unpack there.

01:28.055 --> 01:30.124
(chuckles)

01:30.158 --> 01:32.526
**

01:35.763 --> 01:36.997
Luke was gonna hit you
in the head

01:37.030 --> 01:38.899
with that rock,
and I saved you.

01:38.932 --> 01:39.967
Saved me?

01:42.170 --> 01:43.204
From my boyfriend?

01:43.237 --> 01:44.772
He doesn't care about you!

01:45.939 --> 01:47.308
He has already moved on.

01:47.341 --> 01:50.544
He has been frolicking
with other women.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.980
**

01:53.013 --> 01:54.482
He's bad news.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.686
S-So, you...

01:58.719 --> 02:01.555
you spy on your mom's camp?

02:01.589 --> 02:03.257
It's not spying.

02:04.492 --> 02:07.795
I am...observing.

02:07.828 --> 02:11.131
**

02:11.165 --> 02:13.634
I have some fresh bandages
for you.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.804
**

02:16.837 --> 02:19.773
May I?

02:19.807 --> 02:22.810
-You really cut yourself bad
running away from Luke.
-(winces)

02:25.112 --> 02:28.816
I promise, I will protect you.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.385
**

02:31.419 --> 02:32.953
(exhales shakily)

02:32.986 --> 02:37.090
**

02:37.124 --> 02:42.863
In the old days, they used
maggots to clean wounds,

02:42.896 --> 02:44.465
stop gangrene.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.600
If you put a maggot on me,
I swear --

02:47.635 --> 02:49.136
-Aah!
-(gasps)

02:49.169 --> 02:51.539
(laughing)
It's antibiotic ointment.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.874
It's a joke.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.443
This might hurt.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.779
**

02:58.812 --> 03:02.550
(groans,
breathing heavily)

03:02.583 --> 03:06.620
I have so much good in me,
but it gets messed up.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.823
Builds up inside,

03:09.857 --> 03:11.825
makes my head hurt.

03:11.859 --> 03:15.529
**

03:15.563 --> 03:18.932
You know what?
(groans)

03:18.966 --> 03:21.001
I think that
you've been out here

03:21.034 --> 03:24.272
on this whole crazy
Duck Dynasty survivalist trip

03:24.305 --> 03:26.607
for a long time,

03:26.640 --> 03:32.012
and maybe you just need
some direction in your life...

03:32.045 --> 03:34.482
like, um...

03:34.515 --> 03:37.518
-a secret mission or something.
-(laughs)

03:38.819 --> 03:41.154
-I like missions.
-Yeah?

03:42.456 --> 03:44.157
I was thinking...

03:45.693 --> 03:47.828
...you can maybe
go into the camp

03:47.861 --> 03:50.331
and get something for me?

03:50.364 --> 03:52.466
Sure.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.101
I can do that.

03:54.134 --> 03:59.373
**

04:00.941 --> 04:05.613
**

04:07.315 --> 04:11.585
**

04:12.586 --> 04:16.457
**

04:17.591 --> 04:20.661
**

04:20.694 --> 04:22.896
This is a sweet little ride.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.332
My daughter has wanted
one of these

04:24.365 --> 04:26.099
since she could
ride a tricycle.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.702
I'm thinking now I should
teach her to ride, you know?

04:28.736 --> 04:30.270
-She doesn't ride?
-No, no.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.739
-Very overprotective mother.
-Mm, got it.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.074
So probably better
that I ask for, uh,

04:34.107 --> 04:36.243
forgiveness than permission,
if you know what I mean.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.879
-(chuckles)
-There's just something about
daddy-daughter time, you know?

04:38.912 --> 04:40.514
* My only company *

04:40.548 --> 04:44.885
-Um, sorry. Give me a moment.
-Sure, yeah.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.087
* And the wind may howl *

04:48.188 --> 04:51.191
Oh, what's that? You've
never seen Emily so happy?

04:51.224 --> 04:52.993
Excuse me, sir.
Is somebody helping you?

04:53.026 --> 04:54.227
(chuckles) Of course not.
'Cause you took her glamping.

04:54.261 --> 04:57.565
I gave her a bike.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.266
CARL: Step off. Come on.
Step off the bike right now!

04:59.299 --> 05:00.801
I mean, come on.
That's...

05:00.834 --> 05:02.403
Get your hands off me!

05:02.436 --> 05:04.237
Whoa. Wait a second.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.940
Hey. Hey!

05:06.974 --> 05:08.576
-Hey, somebody help him!
-He was trying to
steal the bike.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.244
Stop!

05:11.278 --> 05:14.915
**

05:16.149 --> 05:21.789
**

05:21.822 --> 05:22.823
(dog barking)

05:22.856 --> 05:24.958
Whoa, hey! Hey!

05:24.992 --> 05:26.794
**

05:26.827 --> 05:29.430
Sheriff's Department!
Stop!

05:29.463 --> 05:32.900
**

05:32.933 --> 05:35.503
(engine revving)

05:35.536 --> 05:36.970
TRENT:
Let's go! Let's go!

05:37.004 --> 05:38.606
Hey!

05:38.639 --> 05:42.075
2-5-Yankee,
2-Bravo-Golf-Romeo-7-2-5-Yankee.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.777
I got you!

05:43.811 --> 05:45.345
7-2-5-Yankee.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.114
(breathing heavily)

05:47.147 --> 05:49.149
Okay. Okay.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.486
(police radio chatter)

05:52.520 --> 05:54.488
Yeah. Thank you.

05:54.522 --> 05:57.658
CID says the body's been here
less than 48 hours.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.461
Decomp is pretty bad.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.763
I wonder if he died earlier
and the body was moved here.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.065
The trail's up there, right?

06:05.098 --> 06:07.668
Yeah.
What are you thinking?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.737
Maybe an animal
dragged him here,

06:09.770 --> 06:12.540
or he hit his head
and wandered?

06:12.573 --> 06:13.741
Maybe.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.709
Or this is a good place
to dump a body.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.545
Hey, Cass,
I need to head on back now.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.547
Gotta pick up some
new campers coming in.

06:19.580 --> 06:22.650
But, uh, I'll be around
if you need me.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.485
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.554
-For everything.
-Yeah.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.888
You got a little...

06:27.921 --> 06:31.024
**

06:31.058 --> 06:32.793
-Thanks.
-(clears throat)

06:34.327 --> 06:36.163
You two been here
all night?

06:36.196 --> 06:38.298
I wasn't gonna
leave the body.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.833
And he wasn't
gonna leave you.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.435
(scoffs) Okay.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.908
Turkey buzzards made a mess
out of this scene.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.309
Yeah.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.380
Okay.

06:54.047 --> 06:56.316
**

06:58.351 --> 07:02.389
**

07:02.422 --> 07:04.558
Look at this.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.259
What is that?

07:07.795 --> 07:09.296
JENNY: It's weird.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.031
Yeah.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.766
Speaking of weird,

07:12.800 --> 07:14.735
I was driving through
the mountains the other day

07:14.768 --> 07:17.471
and I ran into some guy
whose truck had broken down.

07:17.505 --> 07:20.107
Gave me serious
Ted Kaczynski vibes.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.742
Drove a blue and white
Suburban,

07:21.775 --> 07:25.979
and I remember seeing something
under a tarp in the back.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.481
What do you think it was?

07:27.515 --> 07:30.718
I don't know,
but no one uses that road.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.119
And he was nervous
about something.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.254
Let's see what the coroner
gets back on the body.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.290
**

07:38.291 --> 07:43.096
**

07:43.130 --> 07:45.398
CORMAC: Well, this is it.
This is home base.

07:45.432 --> 07:48.201
Oh, man.
It's beautiful.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.237
-Thank you, Cormac.
-Of course.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.072
Hi, Carla.
So nice to meet you.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.707
Aww, same here.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.710
I can just see why Avery has
been raving about this place.

07:56.744 --> 07:57.978
Well, we try.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.113
Now, I hear you're quite
the fly fisherman.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.381
Well, Avery likes to brag.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.483
Nothing better
than a proud man.

08:03.517 --> 08:06.486
Why don't you let Savannah
take your bags, and you can join

08:06.520 --> 08:07.921
Avery and Emily for
breakfast if you want to?

08:07.955 --> 08:09.690
Okay, good.
Thank you so much.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.024
-Have fun.
-Yeah, thanks.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.826
* Get lost, disappear *

08:12.860 --> 08:16.129
-Whoa.
-I told you it was nice.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.998
I saw horses.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.167
-Yeah.
-Wanted a pony
when I was little.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.535
I got a stick pony instead.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.971
My dad used to chase me around
the house and hit me with it.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.606
Hey, you're gonna
have to cool it

08:25.639 --> 08:27.107
with those stories
while we're here.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.710
-You got it?
-It wasn't that bad.

08:29.743 --> 08:30.878
Okay.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.279
So, you must be Tonya.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.648
Yes. And this is, um --

08:34.682 --> 08:37.951
-this is my husband, Donno.
-Hi.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.119
DONNO: Husband.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.121
I hope it's okay that we're
joining the group so late.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.255
Oh, no problem.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.457
We have a spare tent,
so it worked out perfectly.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.026
Lucky us.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.261
I want to ride a horse.
A white one.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.830
SUNNY:
Uh, we can make that happen.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.399
-And I will name him Gandalf.
-Mm.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.169
Well, he's already got a name,
but you do you.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.640
So, um, why don't y'all join
the gang for breakfast?

08:59.673 --> 09:00.874
I'll take your bags.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.109
Thank you so much.
I'm starving.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.543
DONNO: No. This is my bag.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.445
Or you can keep yours,
if you prefer.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.347
Nobody touches
my camping tools.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.682
Duly noted.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.550
Okay.
Y'all enjoy your breakfast.

09:10.584 --> 09:11.852
Have fun.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.254
* It left a mark on us *

09:14.287 --> 09:16.657
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh *

09:16.690 --> 09:18.592
Since when do we
take latecomers?

09:18.626 --> 09:19.827
Since they paid double,

09:19.860 --> 09:21.494
and since you
stayed out all night,

09:21.528 --> 09:23.230
you don't get a say-so.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.165
CORMAC: I was with Cassie.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.067
We found
the missing backpacker...

09:27.100 --> 09:28.568
dead.

09:28.602 --> 09:31.271
Oh, my gosh.
What happened?

09:31.304 --> 09:33.607
Well, we can't say for sure.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.843
What were you doing out there
helping her?

09:35.876 --> 09:37.945
-'Cause she asked.
-Be careful.

09:37.978 --> 09:41.915
Pretty girl like that, just
make sure she's not using you.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.151
Maybe I want to be used.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.820
Cormac Barnes,
I'm still your mother.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.989
I just don't want you
to get your heart broken.

09:49.022 --> 09:55.763
**

09:55.796 --> 09:59.099
Cassie, Cassie,
Cassie, Cassie.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.035
(sighs)

10:02.069 --> 10:06.073
**

10:06.106 --> 10:09.042
Getaway truck is registered
here to a Sam Dillard.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.779
I just got a bad feeling
about this guy.

10:11.812 --> 10:12.846
Y'know, boss, I can handle this.

10:12.880 --> 10:13.947
It's probably
just some punk kid

10:13.981 --> 10:15.515
trying to steal wheels
for a joyride.

10:15.548 --> 10:18.185
You really wanna blow your day
off on a minor infraction?

10:18.218 --> 10:19.653
Hell, yeah, I do.
You know why?

10:19.687 --> 10:21.354
That punk stabbed somebody
with a screwdriver.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.756
Aggravated assault's a felony.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.557
Copy that.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.694
I'm gonna -- I'm gonna have
a look for the truck

10:26.727 --> 10:27.995
while you charm
the manager, okay?

10:28.028 --> 10:29.062
Okay.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.732
Hello?

10:31.765 --> 10:35.435
(rock music playing on radio)

10:35.468 --> 10:38.772
**

10:40.808 --> 10:43.777
**

10:43.811 --> 10:47.280
* Save your crying' *

10:47.314 --> 10:52.319
Hey, there. Excuse me?
Hey. Sorry.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.654
I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions?

10:54.688 --> 10:56.056
Sure thing.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.425
* No more lying' *

10:58.458 --> 10:59.860
Officer...?

10:59.893 --> 11:01.128
Deputy. Poppernak.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.996
Dep-- Deputy Poppernak.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.664
(laughs)

11:04.698 --> 11:06.900
-My uncle was a cop.
-Nice.

11:06.934 --> 11:09.102
I'm --
I'm looking for a truck.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.437
Maybe you can help me.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.973
* Get what you need,
bring it on, bring it on *

11:13.006 --> 11:14.674
* Bring it on, babe *

11:14.708 --> 11:15.776
Haven't seen it.

11:15.809 --> 11:18.245
-Mm.
-What's this about?

11:18.278 --> 11:20.680
We're looking for a guy
who tried to steal a motorcycle,

11:20.714 --> 11:22.249
hoping you might
know something.

11:22.282 --> 11:26.519
**

11:28.121 --> 11:30.457
**

11:30.490 --> 11:33.260
Yeah, that truck's been here for
awhile, hardly ever gets moved.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.995
When was the last time
you saw the owner?

11:35.028 --> 11:37.898
It's been awhile.
He must be like 90.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.735
Customers have
a unique access code,

11:41.769 --> 11:44.772
so we know every time when
a vehicle enters and exits.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.073
BEAU: All right.
I might need that.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.775
-Sure.
-(vehicle approaches)

11:47.808 --> 11:49.977
Son of a bitch.
That's it right there!

11:50.010 --> 11:52.279
**

11:52.312 --> 11:55.282
Pop, hey!
You seeing this?

11:55.315 --> 11:56.917
Truck's leaving the lot
right now.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.618
What's your 20?

11:59.753 --> 12:00.954
Pop!

12:03.556 --> 12:07.160
**

12:07.194 --> 12:08.228
Hey.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.696
Hey, girlfriend.
Whadja got for us?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.132
Your backpacker, Mark Woodman's,
personal effects.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.134
Wait, don't you
need this as evidence?

12:14.167 --> 12:16.403
The coroner ruled his death
an accident.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.038
It's to give back
to his parents.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.206
There's no way
this was an accident.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.808
He must have fallen
from a height.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.476
He had broken ribs,
which means he could've walked

12:23.510 --> 12:25.078
or crawled away
before he died.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.280
Ok-- What about
the photo I gave you?

12:27.314 --> 12:29.883
-Still waiting.
-(sighs)

12:29.917 --> 12:34.387
Okay, CID said he died days ago,
and if that's true,

12:34.421 --> 12:36.990
his parents got that e-mail
after he died.

12:37.024 --> 12:40.160
And where's his phone?
It's not in here.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.694
It wasn't recovered.

12:41.728 --> 12:44.164
Okay, call me a conspiracy
theorist -- actually, don't --

12:44.197 --> 12:45.799
but I'm telling you
that this is connected

12:45.833 --> 12:47.234
to the Bleeding Heart murder.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.236
That was 20 years ago.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.671
No, no, no,
but I can feel it in my bones.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.473
The coroner ruled this death
an accident.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.475
His parents are gonna be here
in a couple hours.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.011
Okay, we should just stick
with the facts

12:58.045 --> 13:02.415
-unless you find evidence
that it wasn't an accident.
-(cellphone rings)

13:02.449 --> 13:03.483
Hey.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.920
What happened?

13:06.954 --> 13:08.521
-I'll be right there.
-What is it?

13:08.555 --> 13:10.023
It's Poppernak.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.425
**

13:16.463 --> 13:20.067
If you're waiting on an apology,
you're gonna be disappointed.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.536
I'm not gonna apologize
for trying to help my own son.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.073
Well, it's my job
to protect you,

13:26.106 --> 13:28.775
especially from the things
that you can't see coming.

13:28.808 --> 13:33.046
(scoffs) I draw a hard line when
it comes to my own blood.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.949
Now, like it or not,
Walter's mine, and I get it.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.717
You don't want him
to make a mess.

13:37.750 --> 13:41.554
We made a deal that Cormac would
never know about any of this.

13:41.588 --> 13:42.789
SUNNY: I know that.

13:42.822 --> 13:43.891
If that ever happens,

13:43.924 --> 13:45.893
we'll just cross that bridge
when we get there.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.460
-Yeah, well...
-(firewood thuds)

13:47.494 --> 13:49.262
...he tell you about how
he and Cassie Dewell

13:49.296 --> 13:50.463
found the backpacker?

13:50.497 --> 13:51.564
He did.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.200
Are you gonna tell me
the whole story?

13:54.634 --> 13:56.336
(sighs)

13:59.139 --> 14:01.341
Walter brought the boy to me.

14:01.374 --> 14:04.111
-Why?
-'Cause he was hurt, bad.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.179
Wasn't nothing anybody
could do to help him.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.680
Walter do something to him?

14:07.714 --> 14:10.183
No. The boy fell.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.119
Walter was trying
to save his life.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.453
(scoffs)

14:13.486 --> 14:16.156
Like he saved the folks
that adopted him?

14:16.189 --> 14:18.191
They weren't worth saving.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.360
Did the world a favor,
if you ask me.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.829
-What about Paige?
-Oh, don't go there.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.364
BUCK: Oh, we're already there.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.634
We know he's capable.
What if he did something to her?

14:27.667 --> 14:29.369
How many people
does he have to hurt

14:29.402 --> 14:31.771
before you see him
for what he really is?

14:31.804 --> 14:33.373
I'm his mother.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.609
It doesn't matter what he does.
I'll always love him.

14:36.643 --> 14:39.612
Well, if you think I'm gonna
stand around and watch him wreck

14:39.646 --> 14:41.982
everything that we've built,

14:42.015 --> 14:43.984
you are sadly mistaken.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.119
Well, what would you
have me do?

14:46.153 --> 14:48.088
Maybe it's time
to let the law handle it.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.091
I mean, if --
if it's like you say it is.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.459
Can't do it.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.128
I let him use the old truck
to move the backpacker's body,

14:55.162 --> 14:57.564
and Cassie Dewell
saw him driving it.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.002
Okay, here's what
we got to do, then --

15:02.035 --> 15:04.837
Okay, before you have any ideas,
let me tell you.

15:04.871 --> 15:07.307
We're gonna move
Walter far away.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.576
You already tried that, Sunny.

15:09.609 --> 15:13.113
SUNNY: I know, but this time
he's not gonna have a say in it.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.581
Come hell or high water,

15:14.614 --> 15:17.717
he's gonna do exactly
what I tell him to do.

15:17.750 --> 15:24.657
**

15:24.691 --> 15:25.758
Are you with me?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.829
Always, babe.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.731
Till they bury me
deep in the ground.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.667
(chuckles)

15:34.701 --> 15:35.768
Come here.

15:35.802 --> 15:40.173
**

15:40.207 --> 15:42.075
I mean, I literally watched
the truck speed off.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.044
I didn't know Pop was in it.
I've been trying his cellphone.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.345
Where were you
when it happened?

15:45.378 --> 15:46.546
I was talking
with the lot manager,

15:46.579 --> 15:48.715
about to get the lot logs,
and then I --

15:48.748 --> 15:50.417
(cellphone ringing)

15:50.450 --> 15:52.385
You hear that?

15:52.419 --> 15:56.056
**

15:56.089 --> 15:58.858
(ringing continues)

15:58.891 --> 16:05.232
**

16:05.265 --> 16:07.134
(sighs)
It's his phone.

16:07.167 --> 16:10.570
**

16:10.603 --> 16:12.272
-(ringing stops)
-(sighs) Okay.

16:12.305 --> 16:16.509
**

16:16.543 --> 16:19.112
Radio.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.213
BEAU: Oh, come on.

16:20.247 --> 16:23.150
**

16:23.183 --> 16:24.217
What is this?

16:24.251 --> 16:25.452
It's a paddock stand.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.754
Somebody was working
on a motorcycle here.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.389
Maybe it was the guy
that I was chasing.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.957
Maybe Poppernak
surprised him.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.559
But why take a cop?

16:32.592 --> 16:34.061
It's not like he needs
another felony.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.262
BEAU: That's a good question.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.729
Unless it was to cover up
something bigger,

16:36.763 --> 16:38.498
you know, like a --
like a-a bike theft ring,

16:38.531 --> 16:40.333
and they're using the truck
to hide the stolen goods.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.434
Do you know who
the owner is?

16:41.468 --> 16:43.403
Some 90-year-old
in the North Valley.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.737
Doesn't make any sense, right?

16:44.771 --> 16:46.106
No, but we gotta figure
this out fast.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.574
We're talking about
my partner here.

16:47.607 --> 16:51.644
**

16:51.678 --> 16:52.979
We gotta let him go.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.049
Too late. He saw you.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.085
So it's my fault
you grabbed a cop?

16:58.118 --> 17:00.853
(coughing)

17:00.887 --> 17:02.189
I think he's choking.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.690
Too bad.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.192
(Poppernak moans)

17:05.225 --> 17:07.560
**

17:07.594 --> 17:10.163
(breathing heavily)
You gotta let me go now.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.698
Shut him up!

17:13.100 --> 17:15.268
Now! Or I will!

17:16.936 --> 17:18.271
(door slides open)

17:19.872 --> 17:22.875
I told you bringing
your girlfriend was a bad idea.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.145
-Heather's cool.
-Mnh-mnh. She's green.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.179
She's soft.
She can't handle this.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.614
You think I'm not
tough enough?

17:29.048 --> 17:30.217
Watch me.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.187
Hey, hey, hey.
It's just one job.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.955
We'll be in and out of the bank,
quick and easy.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.724
You want my mom's stuff or not?

17:38.925 --> 17:40.493
We play by my rules.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.028
We're hitting this bank.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.163
He comes with.

17:43.196 --> 17:46.866
**

17:46.899 --> 17:49.636
-You're gonna kill a cop?
-Depends.

17:49.669 --> 17:50.670
POPPERNAK: No, no, no, no. No.

17:50.703 --> 17:55.342
**

17:55.375 --> 17:56.576
Okay, people, listen up.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.545
I want an officer
with Poppernak's mother,

17:58.578 --> 18:00.947
and I want a patrol car sitting
out in front of her house.

18:00.980 --> 18:03.082
I ran the entire family
of the truck owner.

18:03.116 --> 18:04.684
Found a grandson,
Trent Dillard,

18:04.717 --> 18:07.854
who had a record of disorderly
conduct and shoplifting.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.022
That is the guy
from this morning.

18:10.056 --> 18:12.192
There's more. Trent is
a former motocross rider.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.394
When did he escalate to grand
theft auto and kidnapping?

18:14.427 --> 18:15.462
Good question.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.864
All right,
I've got the lot logs.

18:17.897 --> 18:20.300
Cross-check these logs
with the crime database.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.868
I want to see everything
that was happening

18:21.901 --> 18:23.436
whenever that truck
left the lot.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.071
We're thinking alike.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.207
**

18:27.240 --> 18:28.975
(mouse clicking)

18:29.008 --> 18:30.843
Son of a bitch.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.381
He's stealing a lot more
than bikes, Hoyt.

18:34.414 --> 18:39.085
**

18:41.921 --> 18:44.857
(whispers) Hey, you don't have
to do this.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.058
It's not too late
to change your mind.

18:46.092 --> 18:47.427
You got your whole life
ahead of you.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.928
Stop talking.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.299
ANNE: Good afternoon.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.068
Is everything all right,
Officer?

18:56.102 --> 18:58.738
Follow my instructions
or she shoots him.

18:58.771 --> 19:02.842
**

19:02.875 --> 19:05.978
Hand me your pass card and
the master safety deposit key.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.648
Do anything stupid,
people will get hurt.

19:10.617 --> 19:13.320
-Do what he says.
-Come on, come on.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.289
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

19:16.323 --> 19:20.193
**

19:20.227 --> 19:22.395
Don't! Hey.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.031
That would be stupid.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.267
**

19:27.300 --> 19:29.669
(screaming)

19:29.702 --> 19:32.705
**

19:32.739 --> 19:35.775
You two, come out!
Come out!

19:35.808 --> 19:37.677
Everybody else,
face down on the ground,

19:37.710 --> 19:39.078
hands on the back
of your head!

19:39.111 --> 19:41.781
Eyes shut, mouths closed!

19:41.814 --> 19:44.351
Disobey and there
will be consequences!

19:44.384 --> 19:46.819
Trent Dillard
has robbed three banks

19:46.853 --> 19:48.488
in the past six years.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.490
Always gets away
on a motorcycle,

19:50.523 --> 19:52.091
just disappears into thin air.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.461
He always kills a hostage.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.596
State and federal authorities
have been alerted

19:56.629 --> 19:58.431
and we are notifying
every local bank.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.800
Meanwhile, I need
a police cruiser

20:00.833 --> 20:02.269
and two armed police officers

20:02.302 --> 20:03.870
out in front
of every local branch.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.506
We are putting together
a central strike team

20:06.539 --> 20:07.874
in case anybody gets the call.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.342
Talk to dispatch
about your assignments.

20:09.376 --> 20:10.777
Guys, let's go.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.945
**

20:12.979 --> 20:15.415
(breathing heavily)
This wasn't the plan.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.785
You didn't have to shoot her.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.186
Would you rather I shot you?

20:23.856 --> 20:25.458
Uh-huh.

20:25.492 --> 20:30.196
**

20:30.229 --> 20:31.931
Time to prove how tough you are.

20:31.964 --> 20:35.201
**

20:35.234 --> 20:36.269
Come on.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.472
Nobody move.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.908
Anybody calls an ambulance,
this man is dead!

20:44.411 --> 20:45.445
Face down!

20:45.478 --> 20:48.080
**

20:48.114 --> 20:49.115
Go.

20:49.148 --> 20:52.419
**

20:54.987 --> 20:57.790
**

20:57.824 --> 21:02.995
(upbeat music playing)

21:03.029 --> 21:05.598
I've been thinking about
the person in the woods.

21:05.632 --> 21:06.866
(music stops)

21:06.899 --> 21:08.234
The one that you said
that you saw the night

21:08.267 --> 21:10.169
that Paige left
or went missing.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.605
Look, I told you I don't
remember anything.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.574
And if you're smart,
you'll stay out of it.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.942
Is that a warning?

21:15.975 --> 21:17.009
Yes.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.882
About what, exactly?

21:23.716 --> 21:25.718
(sighs)

21:25.752 --> 21:27.820
Okay, look.

21:27.854 --> 21:30.423
Paige isn't...

21:30.457 --> 21:32.359
Little Miss Innocent, okay?

21:32.392 --> 21:33.860
There's things about her
that are --

21:33.893 --> 21:35.995
Hi.
Mind if we join you?

21:36.028 --> 21:38.531
Oh, not at all, no.
Um, welcome to the trip.

21:38.565 --> 21:41.033
Thank you. I'm Tonya.
This is Donno.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.035
We're married.
Happily ever after.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.070
TONYA: Don't listen to him.

21:44.103 --> 21:47.507
The sun makes him say
stupid things.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.209
-Oh, well, I'm Emily.
-Luke.

21:50.242 --> 21:51.878
Are you two here together?

21:51.911 --> 21:52.912
EMILY: Oh, no.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.714
I'm -- I'm here with
my mom and my stepdad.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.516
A family trip, sorta.

21:56.549 --> 21:57.984
He came with his girlfriend.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.819
-Girlfriend?
-Where is she?

21:59.852 --> 22:02.288
She, um, had to go home.

22:03.255 --> 22:05.157
Um, nice talking to you.

22:05.191 --> 22:07.994
I think I'm gonna hit
the trails, get a run in.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.796
So, uh...bye.

22:09.829 --> 22:13.400
**

22:15.835 --> 22:19.539
**

22:21.608 --> 22:26.078
**

22:28.147 --> 22:30.116
(sniffles)

22:30.149 --> 22:32.251
"Death by misadventure"?

22:32.284 --> 22:33.553
What does that even mean?

22:33.586 --> 22:37.724
That they think that Mark was
careless and had an accident.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.393
CASSIE: We don't believe that.
At all.

22:41.494 --> 22:45.932
And if you'll let me,
I'd like to keep pursuing this.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.234
We know that your son was
an experienced backpacker

22:48.267 --> 22:49.669
and that he has trekked
some of the most

22:49.702 --> 22:51.638
dangerous places in the world.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.240
He always came home
safe and sound.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.579
Here are some of Mark's things.

22:59.612 --> 23:02.281
We thought you'd want
to have them.

23:04.584 --> 23:08.688
And I wanted to ask you
about this.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.524
It was found in his pocket.

23:11.558 --> 23:14.193
Some sort of talisman
he carried?

23:14.226 --> 23:15.294
No.

23:15.327 --> 23:16.729
I've never seen it before.

23:18.731 --> 23:21.300
Maybe someone
gave it to him?

23:21.333 --> 23:23.803
ELISE: No. Mark would've
just tossed it.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.572
He hated stuff like this...

23:25.605 --> 23:27.474
junk and trinkets, he called it.

23:27.507 --> 23:33.212
**

23:33.245 --> 23:35.882
I'm going to find out
what happened to your son.

23:37.216 --> 23:38.618
I promise you that.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.825
You know that Poppernak is
just talking the guy's ear off

23:45.858 --> 23:49.361
about some species
of Montana Woodpecker, right?

23:50.563 --> 23:52.865
Almost makes you feel bad
for the bank robber.

23:52.899 --> 23:57.236
If anyone can get through this,
it's Poppernak, right?

23:57.269 --> 23:58.771
You're damn right.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.575
I'm gonna give you a hug.

24:02.609 --> 24:06.278
**

24:06.312 --> 24:07.914
We'll find him.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.649
(Madge clears throat)

24:12.151 --> 24:13.285
What do you got?

24:13.319 --> 24:14.854
Green Meadow Savings and Loan

24:14.887 --> 24:16.756
hasn't picked up our calls.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.357
Let's check it out.

24:18.390 --> 24:21.260
**

24:21.293 --> 24:22.795
(clattering)

24:22.829 --> 24:24.864
(Trent laughs)

24:24.897 --> 24:30.537
**

24:30.570 --> 24:31.604
Hurry up!

24:34.106 --> 24:35.474
30 seconds!

24:35.508 --> 24:37.376
I can't find it.
She must've switched boxes.

24:37.409 --> 24:39.411
Find it or forget it.
We leave in 25 seconds.

24:39.445 --> 24:45.752
**

24:45.785 --> 24:47.153
This is a huge mistake.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.057
Nope.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.725
**

24:52.759 --> 24:54.927
Payday!
Let's head to the bikes.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.366
All right, time to go.

25:00.399 --> 25:02.769
We didn't get her stuff!

25:02.802 --> 25:04.003
Turns out I don't need it.

25:05.304 --> 25:06.338
I got enough.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.508
And I'm sick of
your mommy issues.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.012
I'm not leaving without it.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.380
You're not cut out for this.

25:16.448 --> 25:17.984
You weren't gonna make it
out of here anyway.

25:18.017 --> 25:21.187
**

25:21.220 --> 25:23.823
No! What the hell did you do?

25:23.856 --> 25:26.425
**

25:28.995 --> 25:33.299
**

25:33.332 --> 25:35.001
Sheriff's Department.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.502
Everybody stay down.

25:36.535 --> 25:40.873
**

25:40.907 --> 25:42.508
(engine revs)

25:42.541 --> 25:43.509
That's gotta be him.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.777
Go. I got this.

25:44.811 --> 25:48.314
**

25:48.347 --> 25:52.418
(engine revving)

25:52.451 --> 25:57.256
**

25:57.289 --> 25:58.925
(engine revs)

25:58.958 --> 26:04.664
**

26:08.200 --> 26:14.073
**

26:16.308 --> 26:20.813
**

26:22.949 --> 26:25.551
**

26:25.584 --> 26:26.753
(car horn honks)

26:26.786 --> 26:29.188
(tires screeching)

26:29.221 --> 26:31.257
(horn blares)

26:31.290 --> 26:34.661
**

26:37.296 --> 26:40.733
**

26:40.767 --> 26:44.003
(horn honks)

26:44.036 --> 26:48.340
**

26:50.209 --> 26:54.413
**

26:57.116 --> 27:02.454
**

27:03.990 --> 27:05.257
(tires screech)

27:05.291 --> 27:11.130
**

27:12.932 --> 27:13.966
Move out, quick!

27:19.672 --> 27:21.307
(groans)

27:21.340 --> 27:22.909
I got you.

27:22.942 --> 27:25.411
(dialing, ringing)

27:25.444 --> 27:28.114
It's Hoyt. Need an ambulance
and backup now.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.982
(loud bang in distance)

27:30.016 --> 27:35.621
**

27:38.958 --> 27:42.294
**

27:45.031 --> 27:47.934
-Hello again.
-(sighs)

27:47.967 --> 27:50.102
What are you --
Get out of my tent.

27:50.136 --> 27:52.071
Sure thing.

27:52.104 --> 27:55.942
But first --
where's your girlfriend?

27:55.975 --> 27:58.310
-Paige.
-I already told you.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.079
-She went home.
-Mm.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.448
Actually,
we know she didn't.

28:02.481 --> 28:08.420
**

28:10.522 --> 28:11.657
I'll yell.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.026
Then I'm gonna hit you
in the eye with this hatchet.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.694
(chuckles)

28:17.263 --> 28:19.966
Look, I-I don't have what
you're looking for, okay?

28:19.999 --> 28:21.233
She took it.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.135
Took what?

28:23.169 --> 28:24.737
The $15 million.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.505
She took it and left.

28:26.538 --> 28:31.944
**

28:31.978 --> 28:33.712
TONYA: As long as we're
in the camp, you stay here.

28:33.746 --> 28:36.682
You try to run,
Donno will find you, and...

28:36.715 --> 28:38.050
Chop, chop.

28:38.084 --> 28:44.791
**

28:47.326 --> 28:54.233
**

28:55.267 --> 28:56.869
**

28:56.903 --> 28:58.871
(pounding)

29:00.807 --> 29:02.274
(beeps)

29:02.308 --> 29:04.376
(lock clicks)

29:04.410 --> 29:06.412
(grunts)

29:06.445 --> 29:08.014
-Drop the gun.
-HEATHER: Come one step closer

29:08.047 --> 29:09.248
and I'll blow his head off.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.250
-Careful, Hoyt.
-Drop your gun.

29:11.283 --> 29:12.684
-We can talk about this.
-Drop it now

29:12.718 --> 29:13.786
or I'll kill this guy!

29:13.820 --> 29:15.287
Okay, okay.

29:15.321 --> 29:18.190
**

29:18.224 --> 29:20.526
(gun clatters)

29:20.559 --> 29:21.794
You okay, Pops?

29:22.761 --> 29:24.196
Gotta say, I've been better.

29:25.331 --> 29:26.732
I have no weapon.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.467
Now let my partner go.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.802
No way.

29:29.836 --> 29:31.270
Not until I get what I need.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.939
And what's that?

29:32.972 --> 29:34.974
A way outta here.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.642
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.112
Then your friend's gonna die.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.747
-(grunts)
-Okay!

29:41.780 --> 29:43.049
You think I'm not serious?!

29:43.082 --> 29:44.116
I believe you.
Just calm down.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.085
Calm down,
and I will help you.

29:46.118 --> 29:49.321
**

29:51.891 --> 29:54.927
**

29:57.496 --> 30:03.769
**

30:03.802 --> 30:05.237
Whoo!

30:05.271 --> 30:06.305
Wyatt!

30:09.408 --> 30:10.742
Let's move!

30:10.776 --> 30:13.179
(footsteps approaching)

30:14.213 --> 30:16.048
Oh, Wyatt can't do that.

30:16.082 --> 30:18.450
**

30:18.484 --> 30:20.586
Hands where I can see 'em.

30:20.619 --> 30:24.523
**

30:24.556 --> 30:27.759
Okay, understood.

30:27.793 --> 30:29.962
Look, it's gonna take some time
to get you all your money.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.864
This bank doesn't have
enough cash.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.067
-What about my car?
-It's on its way.

30:35.101 --> 30:36.102
And a plane's on standby.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.570
Look, I did everything
that you've asked for.

30:38.604 --> 30:41.273
-Let my partner go now.
-No!

30:41.307 --> 30:45.511
No, he stays with me
until I'm safe and far away.

30:45.544 --> 30:46.946
I know how this works.

30:46.979 --> 30:48.948
As long as I can put
a bullet in his head,

30:48.981 --> 30:50.282
you won't screw with me.

30:50.316 --> 30:51.951
I saved your life, Heather.

30:51.984 --> 30:53.252
This isn't personal.

30:53.285 --> 30:56.088
It's all personal...

30:56.122 --> 30:57.589
all because you're mad
at your mom.

30:57.623 --> 31:00.859
Shut up!
You don't know anything.

31:00.893 --> 31:04.696
**

31:04.730 --> 31:06.665
The bitch cut me off,

31:06.698 --> 31:07.934
stole my inheritance.

31:07.967 --> 31:10.336
I'm just supposed
to forget that?

31:10.369 --> 31:12.104
I'm her flesh and blood.

31:13.572 --> 31:16.375
Flesh and blood doesn't always
make you a good parent.

31:17.309 --> 31:20.079
Look, I get how she hurt you,
Heather.

31:20.112 --> 31:23.649
But don't let her ruin
the rest of your life.

31:24.783 --> 31:26.352
It's -- It's too late for me.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.853
No, it's not. I can help you.

31:27.886 --> 31:32.925
**

31:32.959 --> 31:34.293
Oh.

31:34.326 --> 31:35.694
There's no car or money coming,
is there?

31:35.727 --> 31:37.629
-You're playing me.
-Heather --

31:37.663 --> 31:39.031
(grunts)

31:39.065 --> 31:43.469
**

31:43.502 --> 31:45.537
-(handcuffs click)
-This is what you get
when you mess with my friends.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.839
**

31:51.443 --> 31:55.447
Okay, nothing like
old-fashioned card games

31:55.481 --> 31:57.916
-in the great outdoors, right?
-Mm-mm-mm.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.685
-This is killing you.
-Are you kidding me?

31:59.718 --> 32:00.953
-(laughs)
-This is so much fun.

32:00.987 --> 32:04.090
-No way.
-I love this. This is the best!

32:04.123 --> 32:06.692
(laughter)

32:06.725 --> 32:08.894
(laughing) Yeah, right.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.063
Now, I know it's not your speed,
but, um, babe,

32:11.097 --> 32:13.199
will you please come
fly fishing with me tomorrow?

32:13.232 --> 32:14.666
Uh, I think I will just watch.

32:14.700 --> 32:15.867
No, you're gonna do.

32:15.901 --> 32:19.338
Oh, I'll do, will I?
Oh, well, if you insist.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.740
(chuckles)

32:21.773 --> 32:23.409
Sorry.

32:23.442 --> 32:26.078
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine. I don't...

32:28.080 --> 32:31.150
-Um, Em...
-Mom?

32:31.183 --> 32:34.320
...there's something
that I've been meaning
to talk to you about.

32:34.353 --> 32:37.156
Uh-oh.
Serious Mom voice.

32:37.189 --> 32:41.760
Well, I saw you talking
to that boy earlier,

32:41.793 --> 32:43.329
the one whose girlfriend left?

32:43.362 --> 32:46.698
And I overheard some of the
campers talking about them, too.

32:46.732 --> 32:48.567
Oh, Mom, really?

32:52.571 --> 32:54.040
Whoa. What's this?

32:54.073 --> 32:57.543
-Look at you two,
thick as thieves.
-No, it --

32:57.576 --> 33:00.246
And for the record,
Avery has told me nothing, okay?

33:00.279 --> 33:03.382
-So spill it.
-Spi--

33:03.415 --> 33:05.617
Okay, I'm not, like, into him,

33:05.651 --> 33:07.986
if that's what you're asking.

33:08.020 --> 33:10.056
Okay, good. All right.

33:10.089 --> 33:12.891
I just want to find out
exactly what's going on...

33:12.924 --> 33:14.093
for my podcast.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.294
About relationships.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.197
Okay.
And what did you learn?

33:20.666 --> 33:23.001
I'm not entirely sure that
his girlfriend made it home.

33:23.035 --> 33:26.305
**

33:26.338 --> 33:29.308
-So something bad happened?
-(sighs)

33:29.341 --> 33:31.443
Emily, do any of the other
campers think this?

33:31.477 --> 33:33.579
-Some of them do.
-I can't believe you.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.013
-Emily, you need to keep
your distance from this kid.
-Look, Carla, you're --

33:35.047 --> 33:36.282
-you're getting
ahead of yourself.
-No, no, Luke was about to tell

33:36.315 --> 33:37.616
-me something
really important --
-No. You know what?

33:37.649 --> 33:38.917
-We should -- We should tell
your father about this.
-No, no,

33:38.950 --> 33:40.952
-we do not need to call Beau.
-He's the Sheriff.

33:40.986 --> 33:42.788
-He can get to the bottom of it.
-That's not necessary!

33:42.821 --> 33:45.091
-Sunny says
everything's all right.
-Oh, yeah? Really? Is it?

33:45.124 --> 33:48.394
-You think it's all right?
-Carla, please,
just -- just -- just stop.

33:48.427 --> 33:49.895
Just stop.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.798
Breathe.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.733
(exhales sharply)

33:54.766 --> 33:58.170
Who built a panic room
in our house?

33:58.204 --> 34:01.507
And who insisted
on museum-grade security?

34:01.540 --> 34:02.708
You did.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.676
That's right.

34:04.710 --> 34:07.646
Because I'm
a professional worrier.

34:08.980 --> 34:11.450
And if I were to sense
something even slightly off...

34:12.918 --> 34:15.987
...I'd sound the alarm, okay?

34:16.021 --> 34:17.089
Okay.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.127
Trust me.

34:21.160 --> 34:26.832
**

34:26.865 --> 34:29.501
* Like a harbor sings
to the concrete *

34:29.535 --> 34:31.903
Um, someone's here
to see you, Cass.

34:31.937 --> 34:34.140
Hey. Come in.

34:34.173 --> 34:37.876
* Like a highway rolls
in your childhood dreams *

34:40.579 --> 34:43.149
So, yeah, Denise, I got this.

34:43.182 --> 34:45.617
Okay, well,
call me if you need anything.

34:45.651 --> 34:46.952
Yep. I won't need you.

34:46.985 --> 34:49.855
* And I'm coming for you
like a stampede *

34:49.888 --> 34:52.791
(chuckles, clears throat)

34:52.824 --> 34:57.729
* I'm coming for you
like a driving rain *

34:57.763 --> 34:59.131
-Hi.
-Hi.

34:59.165 --> 35:02.301
* I'm coming for you
like a storm unchained *

35:02.334 --> 35:04.536
-Thanks for coming.
-No, thank you.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.472
Your, uh --
Your call made my day.

35:06.505 --> 35:08.607
-Really?
-I mean, I had to come and grab

35:08.640 --> 35:10.542
some more supplies anyway.
-Mm.

35:10.576 --> 35:14.880
So, uh, what's going on?
What can I do for you?

35:14.913 --> 35:17.449
Um...

35:18.650 --> 35:21.420
I'm looking for a creepy guy
I saw near your camp

35:21.453 --> 35:24.356
a couple days ago,
drove a blue and white Suburban.

35:24.390 --> 35:26.725
Well, that doesn't sound
at all like me.

35:26.758 --> 35:29.595
-(chuckles) Can you focus?
-Absolutely, yes.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.463
-Thank you.
-Um...

35:31.497 --> 35:33.865
Honestly, I haven't seen a soul
up there except for our group.

35:33.899 --> 35:38.036
And, uh, no blue and white
Suburbans.

35:38.069 --> 35:40.071
What about this?

35:40.105 --> 35:41.840
Ever seen anything like this?

35:41.873 --> 35:44.943
Um, it doesn't look familiar.

35:46.111 --> 35:48.414
But I have seen this before.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.251
CASSIE: Heart?

35:54.152 --> 35:56.855
Seen this carved on some of the
trees in the woods near camp.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.990
Where exactly?

36:03.128 --> 36:06.498
It was so strange being
with the bad guys this time.

36:06.532 --> 36:08.267
Everyone just seemed...

36:08.300 --> 36:10.769
I don't know...scared.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.938
* That's why I bought
myself two *

36:12.971 --> 36:16.942
Gotta say, glad it was
you two coming for me.

36:16.975 --> 36:18.577
Yeah, about that...

36:18.610 --> 36:21.079
There's something
we need to tell you.

36:21.112 --> 36:23.649
You're fired. Sorry, buddy.

36:23.682 --> 36:24.750
Wait...

36:24.783 --> 36:27.286
We had no choice. I'm sorry.

36:27.319 --> 36:28.920
It was terrible police work.

36:28.954 --> 36:32.424
Terrible police work.
The worst.

36:32.458 --> 36:35.527
* I've been tryin'
to surrender *

36:35.561 --> 36:39.498
(laughing) Really?

36:39.531 --> 36:41.800
Oh, we're just glad
you're safe.

36:41.833 --> 36:44.002
(laughter)

36:44.035 --> 36:47.138
All right, we need more beers.

36:47.172 --> 36:49.341
-Yeah.
-For the good guys.

36:49.375 --> 36:51.610
(laughs)

36:51.643 --> 36:53.078
That was good.

36:53.111 --> 36:56.181
* How we were
before we changed *

36:56.214 --> 36:58.116
How you holding up?

36:58.149 --> 37:01.420
(sighs)

37:01.453 --> 37:02.988
I don't know.

37:03.021 --> 37:06.492
Just, today got me thinking
about my mom.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.595
Thinking about robbing
some banks?

37:09.628 --> 37:10.662
Maybe.

37:12.598 --> 37:15.033
Well, Hoyt, listen.

37:15.066 --> 37:18.036
All we can do
is the best that we can.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.905
And at the end of the day,

37:19.938 --> 37:23.041
all relationships have to
be a two-way street.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.743
Even blood.

37:26.412 --> 37:29.147
Maybe especially blood.

37:29.180 --> 37:31.216
I hate it when you do that.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.151
BEAU: Do what?

37:33.184 --> 37:36.988
The whole...
cowboy wisdom thing.

37:37.022 --> 37:38.189
Well, my bad.

37:38.223 --> 37:40.559
* You're the ghost *

37:40.592 --> 37:42.861
All right, fine.
I actually kinda like it.

37:42.894 --> 37:43.895
BEAU: Oh.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.498
Well, look, we don't really
blush in Texas,

37:46.532 --> 37:49.835
so, uh, I will just
accept that compliment.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.737
And, uh --

37:51.770 --> 37:53.204
And maybe
we just get drunk.

37:53.238 --> 37:54.873
Okay.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.142
* ...that you'll still
haunt me? *

37:57.175 --> 37:58.810
To family.

37:58.844 --> 37:59.878
BEAU: To family.

38:01.413 --> 38:02.781
Yeah.

38:02.814 --> 38:05.951
**

38:05.984 --> 38:08.620
You know I'm just trying to
protect all of us, don't ya?

38:08.654 --> 38:10.121
So you've said.

38:10.155 --> 38:11.923
SUNNY:
And I'm gonna keep on sayin' it.

38:11.957 --> 38:14.760
Walter's my firstborn,
and I'll always love him,

38:14.793 --> 38:18.163
but that doesn't mean
I love you and Cormac any less.

38:19.365 --> 38:20.832
Are you sure
you can handle this?

38:20.866 --> 38:22.634
Oh, yeah, I can handle it.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.405
I sure am gonna miss
that ol' gal.

38:26.438 --> 38:30.275
Got no other choice with
the blood and the DNA evidence.

38:30.308 --> 38:33.445
I'm sorry.
(sighs)

38:33.479 --> 38:35.414
(rustling)

38:35.447 --> 38:37.783
(whispering) Shh.
Quiet a minute.

38:37.816 --> 38:38.950
-Shh, shh, shh, shh.
-What is it?

38:38.984 --> 38:40.586
Don't.

38:40.619 --> 38:46.792
**

38:48.960 --> 38:50.496
What the hell?

38:53.264 --> 38:54.265
What?

38:54.299 --> 38:56.267
BUCK: Walter's out there
creepin' around.

38:56.301 --> 38:58.136
**

38:58.169 --> 38:59.905
(water running)

39:05.477 --> 39:07.012
(water turns off)

39:07.045 --> 39:08.447
Once.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.548
Destroy.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.049
Hazard.

39:11.082 --> 39:12.150
Excuse me?

39:12.183 --> 39:15.120
Forever. Midnight. Risk.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.792
What the hell is this, Avery?

39:20.826 --> 39:24.530
I was an early investor
in Ethereum,

39:24.563 --> 39:26.965
so I know a seed phrase
when I see one.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.967
-A what?
-A seed phrase.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.536
A code that opens up
a crypto account.

39:30.569 --> 39:31.870
Don't act
like you don't know.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.175
I saw Paige's journal...

39:37.208 --> 39:39.511
and her gun, before she --

39:39.545 --> 39:42.213
While you were looking
for her underwear?

39:42.247 --> 39:44.215
Why were you even going
through that stuff anyway?

39:44.249 --> 39:46.952
I have a stepdaughter
to think about.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.454
And now my wife is here, so...

39:50.155 --> 39:51.457
...if you're in
any kind of trouble...

39:53.725 --> 39:54.726
...you need to tell me.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.161
I don't need to tell you
anything.

39:56.194 --> 39:57.863
Luke, I can help you.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.732
-Because there's
nothing to tell.
-Really?

40:00.766 --> 40:02.568
I just want to enjoy
the rest of this trip.

40:04.736 --> 40:09.741

40:38.837 --> 40:40.639
* But I will not
leave his side *

40:40.672 --> 40:45.010
* And if we die,
we'll die together *

40:45.043 --> 40:50.381

40:50.415 --> 40:54.319

"I have a little girl" *
