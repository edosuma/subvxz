Hi, Steph.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.928
What you doing?

00:10.970 --> 00:13.430
I'm looking at the shapes

00:10.970 --> 00:13.430
in the clouds.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.224
Why?

00:17.518 --> 00:19.979
- It's relaxing.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.979
- Oh!

00:25.484 --> 00:29.404
Hey, doesn't that look like

00:25.484 --> 00:29.404
a kangaroo in a baseball cap?

00:29.446 --> 00:32.992
- Nope.

00:29.446 --> 00:32.992
- Don't you see it?

00:33.033 --> 00:35.828
It's right there next

00:33.033 --> 00:35.828
to the horse eating the taco.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.498
Horses don't eat tacos.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.961
It's not a real horse.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.961
It's just a cloud.

00:44.003 --> 00:46.421
Clouds don't eat tacos either.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.759
Fine. There's no horse.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.759
There's no tacos.

00:50.801 --> 00:53.762
- There's no kangaroos.

00:50.801 --> 00:53.762
- Told you so.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.725
You know, you really

00:55.472 --> 00:57.725
know how to suck the fun

00:57.766 --> 00:59.560
out of cloud-watching.

01:05.941 --> 01:09.110
Oh, there's the horse.

02:35.363 --> 02:38.659

Says here he's known

02:40.869 --> 02:44.999

Yep, and guess whose flab

02:45.040 --> 02:48.752
he's gonna be flinging?

03:18.406 --> 03:20.742

Yeah, well,

Oh, come on, you always

03:42.014 --> 03:45.059

Heck, you called him Rugsy.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.167

04:10.209 --> 04:11.835

04:10.209 --> 04:11.835
it will reverse to the state

04:11.877 --> 04:13.503
and they'll turn it

04:11.877 --> 04:13.503
into a parking lot.

Well, they're not gonna

06:01.695 --> 06:03.071

06:03.113 --> 06:04.531

06:04.572 --> 06:06.992

06:14.208 --> 06:16.459
Sonny and Cher?

06:16.501 --> 06:18.461

06:21.756 --> 06:24.009
- Yeah, yeah, I know her.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.161
What about the age limit?

06:51.203 --> 06:52.662
No age limit.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.662
No alcohol.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.289
- That's cool.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.289
- That would be great.

06:54.331 --> 06:57.584
- Big dance floor. Good food.

- I would love that.

Would you guys hang out

06:57.625 --> 06:58.877

Just get it away from me, okay?

08:17.580 --> 08:18.706
Oh!

08:20.417 --> 08:22.210
It's a bar rag.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.296
Well, maybe you wanna get

08:22.252 --> 08:24.296
that smudge right over there.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.756
Stop it!

08:24.338 --> 08:26.756
Get your fat head out of there.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.467
She gonna be here any minute.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.467
Come on, get out.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.677
Ow! Ow!

08:28.508 --> 08:30.677
I'm saying ow.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.638
I..

08:33.680 --> 08:35.682
I can't move. I'm stuck.

08:35.723 --> 08:37.184
(female #1)

08:35.723 --> 08:37.184
'Mr. Katsopolis?'

08:37.225 --> 08:39.186
- 'Yoo-hoo!'

08:37.225 --> 08:39.186
- She's here.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.648
Hi. Hi.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.648
Come right in. Come right in.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.108
Welcome. Nice to see you.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.486
I'm Eleanor Cooke

08:45.150 --> 08:47.486
from Embarcadero Bank.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.279
Hi. I'm Jesse Katsopolis.

08:49.321 --> 08:50.780
[Joey sneezing]

08:50.822 --> 08:54.617
- What was that?

08:50.822 --> 08:54.617
- Um, well, could be anything.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.078
[Joey sneezing]

08:57.120 --> 09:00.874
Uh, an old bar rag, a rat..

09:00.915 --> 09:02.250
[screaming]

09:04.127 --> 09:06.421
A freak under a bucket.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.133
Could somebody hold my nose?

09:08.006 --> 09:10.133
I gotta pop my ears.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.343
Stop it!

09:12.344 --> 09:14.304
Oh, how terribly rude of me.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.390
This is, uh,

09:14.346 --> 09:16.390
this is Joseph Gladstone.

09:16.431 --> 09:19.600
- Hi.

09:16.431 --> 09:19.600
- Our, uh, head waiter.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.027
Anyway, we've, uh, we-we-we used

09:25.982 --> 09:29.027
to be in advertising together

09:29.069 --> 09:31.196
so we've cooked up this

09:29.069 --> 09:31.196
little presentation if you will

09:31.238 --> 09:34.157
to illustrate the need for a

09:31.238 --> 09:34.157
club like this in San Francisco.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.034
So picture, if you will

09:36.076 --> 09:38.953
Jesse and Joey teenager

09:36.076 --> 09:38.953
walking down the street

09:38.995 --> 09:42.040
but in this case, uh, one of us

09:38.995 --> 09:42.040
has a bar on his shoulders.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.166
Me.

09:46.253 --> 09:50.424
Okay, here we are

09:46.253 --> 09:50.424
walking down the street.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.512
[both whistling]

09:57.305 --> 10:00.225
Uh, Jess, ha ha! Uh,

09:57.305 --> 10:00.225
what do you wanna do tonight?

10:00.267 --> 10:01.351
- Uh, mall?

10:00.267 --> 10:01.351
- Did it.

10:01.393 --> 10:02.477
- Movie?

10:01.393 --> 10:02.477
- Seen it.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.520
- Burger?

10:02.519 --> 10:03.520
- Ate it.

10:03.562 --> 10:05.772
- Bowling?

10:03.562 --> 10:05.772
- Hold it.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.065
No, actually bowling

10:05.813 --> 10:07.065
was roll it

10:07.107 --> 10:08.567
but you get it,

10:07.107 --> 10:08.567
it's a rhyming--

10:08.608 --> 10:11.152
No, I meant hold it,

10:08.608 --> 10:11.152
as in please, go no further.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.530
I have some specific questions

10:11.194 --> 10:13.530
we need to discuss.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.282
Oh, that's no problem.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.282
We can handle that.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.242
- Uh, right, little buddy?

10:15.323 --> 10:17.242
- It's alright.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.955
Actually we need to talk about

10:18.868 --> 10:21.955
what kind of loan you want.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.874
Alright. We got the loan.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.874
Joseph, high five.

10:29.921 --> 10:33.133
Actually, I, uh, I meant

10:29.921 --> 10:33.133
we haven't discussed

10:33.174 --> 10:35.969
the amount, the terms, whether

10:33.174 --> 10:35.969
you want adjustable or fixed.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.597
Oh, well, you lend it,

10:36.010 --> 10:38.597
we'll spend it, right?

10:40.765 --> 10:44.185
I also need to know

10:40.765 --> 10:44.185
if the club is up to code.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.396
Uh, what code?

10:46.438 --> 10:52.152
Codes. Uh, health codes,

10:46.438 --> 10:52.152
fire codes, building codes.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.237
How are your footings

10:52.193 --> 10:54.237
and bearing walls?

10:54.279 --> 10:57.407
Oh, fine, thanks, and yours?

10:57.449 --> 11:00.160
I mean, has the foundation

10:57.449 --> 11:00.160
been inspected?

11:00.201 --> 11:04.789
Uh, well, it hasn't, it hasn't

11:00.201 --> 11:04.789
been, uh, inspected per se

11:04.831 --> 11:07.208
but, uh, you know,

11:04.831 --> 11:07.208
I've-I've checked the foundation

11:07.250 --> 11:10.504
and, uh, you know, it's, uh,

11:07.250 --> 11:10.504
it's really holding up..

11:14.799 --> 11:16.426
Well, it's, see,

11:14.799 --> 11:16.426
still standing.

11:16.468 --> 11:19.471
The place is like a rock.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.807
Mr. Katsopolis, it's, uh,

11:19.513 --> 11:22.807
obvious you're unprepared.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.894
I'm afraid I have no choice

11:22.849 --> 11:26.894
but to deny your loan request.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.605
Miss Cooke, you-you can't,

11:26.936 --> 11:28.605
they're gonna turn

11:28.647 --> 11:29.897
this place into a parking lot.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.817
I'm very sorry.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.817
Goodbye, Mr. Katsopolis.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.653
Mr. Gladstone.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.908
Miss Cooke, give us

11:38.198 --> 11:40.908
a second chance, won't you?

11:40.950 --> 11:43.620
Uh, did I mention your hair

11:40.950 --> 11:43.620
looks nice today?

11:43.662 --> 11:45.163
'Cause it does.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.749
Jess? Hello?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.466
Ma-ma-ma..

12:08.061 --> 12:09.270
How you doin'?

12:09.312 --> 12:10.564
The station just sent

12:09.312 --> 12:10.564
over my outfit

12:10.605 --> 12:12.357
for the sumo wrestler segment.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.858
Great. Let's see it.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.664
There's gotta be more to it

12:25.412 --> 12:27.664
than this.

12:27.706 --> 12:28.998
I'm gonna, I'm gonna

12:27.706 --> 12:28.998
need a tanning booth

12:29.040 --> 12:31.501
and a full body wax.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.670
Fashion tip,

12:31.543 --> 12:33.670
don't wear black socks.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.924
- So, uh, how's Jess doing?

12:35.213 --> 12:37.924
- Oh, not good.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.884
He's really depressed.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.678
What does depressed mean?

12:41.720 --> 12:46.140
Um, depressed means,

12:41.720 --> 12:46.140
you know, uh, sad, unhappy.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.559
You know, how you felt

12:46.182 --> 12:47.559
when you found out

12:47.601 --> 12:49.644
that Gumby

12:47.601 --> 12:49.644
wasn't microwave-safe.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.939
Gotcha.

12:52.980 --> 12:56.443
So let's all try

12:52.980 --> 12:56.443
to be extra nice to him, okay?

12:56.484 --> 12:58.819
I'll give him

12:56.484 --> 12:58.819
my last sweet roll.

12:59.778 --> 13:00.988
[Jesse humming]

13:01.030 --> 13:03.575
Good morning,

13:01.030 --> 13:03.575
my beautiful family.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.535
It's nice to see you all.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.535
Good morning.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.078
I love you all

13:05.577 --> 13:07.078
in a very special way.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.705
Individually, that is.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.125
You are depressed?

13:12.166 --> 13:14.961
Depressed? Ha! I don't know

13:12.166 --> 13:14.961
the meaning of the word.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.171
I don't think daddy does either.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.676
Well, get this, I-I just talked

13:19.758 --> 13:21.676
to the lady from the bank

13:21.718 --> 13:24.679
you know, Miss Cooke, and

13:21.718 --> 13:24.679
she said after a little begging

13:24.721 --> 13:26.013
she's gonna give me

13:24.721 --> 13:26.013
another interview.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.515
In order to keep

13:26.055 --> 13:27.515
the Smash Club alive

13:27.557 --> 13:28.767
I've gotta totally be prepared.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.435
So I'm gonna find a book

13:28.807 --> 13:30.435
on, on every code.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.479
Uh, building codes,

13:30.477 --> 13:32.479
health codes

13:32.520 --> 13:34.063
municipal codes, area codes.

13:34.105 --> 13:36.190
If there's a code out there,

13:34.105 --> 13:36.190
I'm gonna crack it.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.361
I'm glad you're happy again,

13:37.484 --> 13:40.361
Uncle Jesse.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.363
Aw, thanks, Michelle.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.501
Here, Michelle.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.003
Ah, this is the life.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.131
Wait a second.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.841
This is a nectarine.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.804
I asked for a peach.

14:06.845 --> 14:08.556
See, this is bald.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.017
Try again.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.730
Nicky, did you find

14:13.478 --> 14:15.730
Waldo yet for me?

14:15.772 --> 14:17.273
No Waldo.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.486
- Keep looking. He's in there.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.486
- Okay.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.701
Okay.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.869
Oh, Becky, that sumo wrestler

14:29.910 --> 14:31.579
really did a number on my back.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.708
Could you do me a favor,

14:32.706 --> 14:34.708
could you, uh

14:34.749 --> 14:36.417
get me an ice pack or somethin'?

14:36.459 --> 14:40.463
Oh, come on, Danny. Bozoyashi

14:36.459 --> 14:40.463
didn't sit on you that hard.

14:40.505 --> 14:44.676
Becky, the only way a 700-pound

14:40.505 --> 14:44.676
guy sits on you is hard.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.969
We're out of ice,

14:44.718 --> 14:46.969
we have waffles

14:47.011 --> 14:50.264
a pint of rocky road,

14:47.011 --> 14:50.264
and a rump roast.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.850
Bring me the rump roast.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.145
Danny, this is our dinner.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.106
I'm gonna defrost it anyway.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.945
Let's eat out tonight.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.407
Ah!

15:09.534 --> 15:12.453
Guys, I'm thirsty.

15:09.534 --> 15:12.453
Where's that water?

15:12.495 --> 15:14.080
Mean Michelle.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.752
- Come on. I'm really dry.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.752
- 'Mean.'

15:23.590 --> 15:25.049
Ah! Hey!

15:27.635 --> 15:29.220
Hey!

15:29.262 --> 15:31.138
My hair! My shirt!

15:31.180 --> 15:32.891
I'm soaked.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.142
- What's going on out here?

15:32.932 --> 15:35.142
- What's happenin' out here?

15:35.184 --> 15:38.062
Nicky and Alex got me all wet.

15:38.104 --> 15:41.232
Boys, that was not very nice.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.985
It gets worse.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.985
They brought me the wrong fruit.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.655
They cleaned my room wrong.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.655
They brushed my hair wrong--

15:47.697 --> 15:49.532
Michelle. Michelle.

15:51.075 --> 15:55.037
Honey, you know what?

15:51.075 --> 15:55.037
It, uh, oh!

15:55.079 --> 15:58.291
It sounds to me

15:55.079 --> 15:58.291
like you're trying to turn

15:58.332 --> 16:01.795
your little cousins

15:58.332 --> 16:01.795
into your own personal servants.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.588
Is that how it sounds?

16:05.799 --> 16:07.592
Maybe I said it wrong.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.262
You know, Michelle, even though

16:09.135 --> 16:11.262
Nicky and Alex are little

16:11.304 --> 16:15.475
they're still people, and we

16:11.304 --> 16:15.475
need to treat them with respect.

16:15.516 --> 16:18.185
I know, but it was so easy.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.148
I'm sorry

16:19.979 --> 16:22.148
for being so bossy.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.942
Are you mad at me?

16:33.743 --> 16:37.831
Okay, next. "Section 27635

16:33.743 --> 16:37.831
of the health code."

16:37.872 --> 16:40.374
27635 of the health code.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.374
27..

16:40.416 --> 16:43.544
Oh, that's, uh, all restrooms

16:40.416 --> 16:43.544
must have self-closing doors.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.338
- Am I right?

16:43.586 --> 16:45.338
- Close.

16:45.379 --> 16:48.048
"Food preparation areas must

16:45.379 --> 16:48.048
be lit to a minimum brightness

16:48.090 --> 16:50.551
of 20 foot candles of light."

16:50.593 --> 16:52.345
Close? How is that close?

16:52.386 --> 16:55.515
It's not.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.515
I was just tryin' to be nice.

16:55.556 --> 16:58.601
I've got one. 27626.

16:58.643 --> 17:01.562
27626, uh, that would be, uh

17:01.604 --> 17:04.190
portable water supply

17:01.604 --> 17:04.190

17:04.231 --> 17:06.275
with the 1989 standard.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.275
Am-am I right?

17:06.317 --> 17:09.111
I don't know.

17:06.317 --> 17:09.111
I just made up a number.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.947
[doorbell ringing]

17:09.153 --> 17:10.947
Michelle.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.448
Uh, alright. There she is.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.448
Everybody, out.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.783
Come on.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.783
Thank you guys for helping.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.994
Out, out, out, out, out, out.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.495
- Okay.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.495
- Ah!

17:17.537 --> 17:18.705
Are you sure

17:17.537 --> 17:18.705
you don't need any help?

17:18.746 --> 17:20.456
Oh, no,

17:18.746 --> 17:20.456
it-it-it's too late now.

17:20.498 --> 17:23.167
It's just me and her.

17:20.498 --> 17:23.167
Mano-a-womano.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.464
- Hi.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.464
- Good afternoon.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.676
Nice to see you again.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.676
Uh, won't you sit down?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.803
[clears throat]

17:31.718 --> 17:33.803
Can I get you something to eat?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.803
Drink?

17:33.845 --> 17:36.055
- Approve?

17:33.845 --> 17:36.055
- We'll see.

17:36.096 --> 17:38.140
Okay, well, listen,

17:36.096 --> 17:38.140
I've done some research

17:38.182 --> 17:40.434
and I found that the last

17:38.182 --> 17:40.434
major renovation done

17:40.476 --> 17:42.436
to the Smash Club was in 1986.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.604
Oh, then you'll have to upgrade

17:43.646 --> 17:45.565
the food preparation areas

17:43.646 --> 17:45.565
to code.

17:45.606 --> 17:46.941
Right.

17:45.606 --> 17:46.941
Food preparation areas.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.943
That's-that's a,

17:46.983 --> 17:48.943
that's a good..

17:48.985 --> 17:51.153
Uh, you know, we were just

17:48.985 --> 17:51.153
going over that code earlier.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.906
It's, it's actually,

17:51.195 --> 17:52.906
uh, it's actually

17:52.947 --> 17:54.490
one of my favorite codes.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.490
Don't tell me.

17:54.532 --> 17:58.202
Uh, I know it

17:54.532 --> 17:58.202
like I know my address.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.079
- Uncle Jesse.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.079
- 'Yes, what?'

18:00.120 --> 18:02.665
D.J. said

18:00.120 --> 18:02.665
I don't have a bellybutton.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.709
What? Of course,

18:02.707 --> 18:04.709
you have a belly button.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.878
Uh, can't you see

18:04.751 --> 18:06.878
that I'm busy here?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.588
Could you check?

18:13.801 --> 18:17.513
Uh, let me see. Oh, yes,

18:13.801 --> 18:17.513
you do have a bellybutton.

18:17.555 --> 18:20.182
Very good, you go back

18:17.555 --> 18:20.182
and tell D.J. that, uh

18:20.224 --> 18:21.893
you have the bellybutton

18:20.224 --> 18:21.893
of an angel.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.605
Oh, by the way, that-that code

18:23.811 --> 18:25.605
you were wondering

18:25.646 --> 18:29.025
that was, uh, 27635.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.568
I'm sure it was.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.404
Uh, now let's talk

18:30.610 --> 18:33.404
maximum capacity, hmm?

18:33.446 --> 18:37.491
Maximum capacity. Good. That

18:33.446 --> 18:37.491
would be under the fire codes.

18:37.533 --> 18:40.160
Uh, which is, uh, that's a,

18:37.533 --> 18:40.160
that's a good one, too.

18:40.202 --> 18:42.162
You know, it's funny 'cause

18:40.202 --> 18:42.162
I was, I was just, uh..

18:42.204 --> 18:45.291
I was just reading about the

18:42.204 --> 18:45.291
fire codes today in the, uh..

18:45.332 --> 18:47.376
...big red book.

18:47.418 --> 18:48.544
Okay, big red book.

18:48.586 --> 18:51.213
- Big red book.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.924
Hey, speaking of codes

18:51.255 --> 18:52.924
in general, you know

18:52.966 --> 18:57.762
one of my all-time favorite

18:52.966 --> 18:57.762
codes is 07470

18:57.804 --> 18:59.973
which is,

18:57.804 --> 18:59.973
we all know is the, uh

19:00.014 --> 19:01.641
zip code of Wayne, New Jersey.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.517
But you know the odd thing

19:01.682 --> 19:03.517
about that, and I tell people

19:03.559 --> 19:05.770
it freaks them out, it's the

19:03.559 --> 19:05.770
same forward as it is backwards.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.564
- It's a wacky, wacky--

19:05.812 --> 19:08.564
- Bologna-sandwich time.

19:08.606 --> 19:11.358
Oh, would you look at the time?

19:08.606 --> 19:11.358
By God, it is.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.612
Doctor's orders.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.612
Uh, I have low blood fat so..

19:14.654 --> 19:17.239
Uh, let me inspect that

19:14.654 --> 19:17.239
sandwich immediately, please.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.366
I have to..

19:19.408 --> 19:21.995
Uh, yeah, Michelle, you know

19:19.408 --> 19:21.995
that I love brown mustard

19:22.036 --> 19:23.871
on my bologna sandwiches.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.873
Sorry. I'll get it

19:23.913 --> 19:25.873
right tomorrow.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.500
Very good. Run along.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.128
Oh, uh, by the way, that code

19:27.541 --> 19:30.128
just popped into my head.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.673
It was, uh, 74762.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.843
Mr. Katsopolis, let's talk about

19:33.714 --> 19:36.843
things that are a bit more basic

19:36.884 --> 19:38.761
like your financial statement,

19:36.884 --> 19:38.761
hmm?

19:38.803 --> 19:42.723
Oh, great. Very good. Well, uh,

19:38.803 --> 19:42.723
basically, it's-it's right here.

19:42.765 --> 19:45.977
Here's my financial statement,

19:42.765 --> 19:45.977
uh, some basic floor plans

19:46.019 --> 19:49.105
and a basic perspective which

19:46.019 --> 19:49.105
I think you'll basically enjoy.

19:49.147 --> 19:52.650
Oh, good.

19:49.147 --> 19:52.650
I'm very impressed.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.235
- You've done your homework.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.235
- Thank you.

19:55.277 --> 19:58.197
Now the most important question.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.074
Shoot.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.952
Why do you want

20:00.116 --> 20:02.952
to reopen the Smash Club?

20:04.704 --> 20:07.498
Uh, why do I wanna reopen

20:04.704 --> 20:07.498
the Smash Club?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.583
Well, that's-that is a, that's

20:07.540 --> 20:09.583
a, that's a good question.

20:09.625 --> 20:13.796
Why do I wanna.. Why do I

20:09.625 --> 20:13.796
wanna reopen the smash club?

20:13.838 --> 20:15.715
What kind of bread

20:13.838 --> 20:15.715
do you want?

20:17.257 --> 20:20.553
Mr. Katsopolis, I'm afraid

20:17.257 --> 20:20.553
the answer to this one

20:20.594 --> 20:22.763
won't be found in a sandwich.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.019
Hold the mayo. We're busted.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.856
Uh, I-I..

20:29.645 --> 20:31.856
Don't tell me.

20:31.898 --> 20:35.275
I know this one.

20:31.898 --> 20:35.275
Um, profit margins?

20:35.317 --> 20:38.863
- Uh, franchising?

20:35.317 --> 20:38.863
- I don't think you understand.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.031
Give me the first two letters.

20:40.073 --> 20:43.159
Mr. Katsopolis,

20:40.073 --> 20:43.159
I can't help you.

20:45.036 --> 20:48.247
Hey, Miss Cooke,

20:45.036 --> 20:48.247
what do you want from me?

20:48.288 --> 20:50.499
You know,

20:48.288 --> 20:50.499
I-I-I'm not a businessman.

20:50.541 --> 20:53.460
And I'm not

20:50.541 --> 20:53.460
a suit-and-tie kind of guy.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.504
The Smash Club just fell

20:53.502 --> 20:55.504
in my lap, it was the place

20:55.546 --> 20:57.590
that I grew up, it's a place

20:55.546 --> 20:57.590
that's very close to my heart

20:57.631 --> 20:59.675
and I don't wanna see it die.

20:59.717 --> 21:02.511
You know, my plan was

20:59.717 --> 21:02.511
to fix it up, you know?

21:02.553 --> 21:05.514
Introduce a whole new generation

21:02.553 --> 21:05.514
to great music.

21:05.556 --> 21:08.434
I mean, don't you think

21:05.556 --> 21:08.434
a, a family and their kids

21:08.475 --> 21:10.103
deserve a better place

21:08.475 --> 21:10.103
to hang out

21:10.144 --> 21:13.856
other than, uh,

21:10.144 --> 21:13.856
behind a kitchen door?

21:18.903 --> 21:21.030
Listen, Miss Cooke,

21:18.903 --> 21:21.030
I-I don't have all the answers

21:21.072 --> 21:24.033
so you know what,

21:21.072 --> 21:24.033
go ahead and turn me down.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.367
But I promise you,

21:24.075 --> 21:25.367
I'm gonna find a way

21:25.409 --> 21:27.703
to keep the Smash Club open.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.455
I know you will.

21:29.496 --> 21:31.415
That's why

21:29.496 --> 21:31.415

21:37.463 --> 21:39.882
Really? You're gonna, you're

21:37.463 --> 21:39.882
gonna approve the.. Thank you.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.176
Your answer was exactly

21:39.924 --> 21:42.176
what I wanted to hear.

21:42.218 --> 21:45.471
- It came from your heart.

21:42.218 --> 21:45.471
- Yeah, well, uh..

21:45.512 --> 21:48.182
- I got the big one right.

21:45.512 --> 21:48.182
- Yeah.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.768
Well, you-you got

21:48.224 --> 21:50.768
another thing right too.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.272
You're really not

21:50.810 --> 21:54.272
the suit-and-tie type.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.607
I prefer you

21:54.313 --> 21:56.607

21:59.359 --> 22:01.946
I have a leather vest?

22:01.988 --> 22:04.782
Well, I've seen you perform.

22:29.098 --> 22:30.516

22:29.098 --> 22:30.516
- Yeah.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.518
I love when you did that.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.405
Alright, yeah.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.405
Well, thank you, guys.

22:45.447 --> 22:47.074
Uncle Jesse,

22:45.447 --> 22:47.074
I wanna be a waitress.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.367
- Yeah, let me decorate.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.367
- I can make bologna sandwiches.

22:49.409 --> 22:51.037
Yo, I'm still..

22:49.409 --> 22:51.037
Hold the thought.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.955
I'm never gonna hear

22:51.078 --> 22:52.955
