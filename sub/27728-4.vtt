00:00.459 --> 00:01.835
Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...

00:01.835 --> 00:04.254
(gunshots)
(grunts)

00:04.254 --> 00:04.880
No.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.381
ISOBEL:
20 years of keeping this secret

00:06.381 --> 00:08.467
and now you up and
resurrect someone?

00:08.467 --> 00:09.968
LIZ:
So if you can heal with
electricity,

00:09.968 --> 00:12.095
can you also harm?
(gasps)

00:12.095 --> 00:14.598
ISOBEL:
He's letting Liz experiment
on him.

00:14.598 --> 00:16.516
If a bio-medical engineer
knows how Max is put together,

00:16.516 --> 00:18.060
she's gonna know how
to dismantle him.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.853
We have to get her far away
from our brother.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.605
MICHAEL:
You gonna mind-warp Liz?

00:21.605 --> 00:23.148
ISOBEL:
It's time for you
to leave Roswell.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.483
I can't leave.
Why not?

00:24.483 --> 00:26.026
Max.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.444
Rosa used to hide things
all the time.

00:27.444 --> 00:28.862
You think she was seeing
someone?

00:28.862 --> 00:30.572
MARIA:
I saw her sneak out the window.

00:30.572 --> 00:31.782
I figured there must be a boy.

00:31.782 --> 00:32.908
LIZ:
Max.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.284
I'm sorry, we're closed.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.078
Could you come back?
I need to talk to you.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.371
I know that my sister was
murdered by an alien

00:37.371 --> 00:38.747
So was it you?

00:38.747 --> 00:40.582
Do you really think I am capable

00:40.582 --> 00:42.209
of killing Rosa?

00:42.209 --> 00:45.087
I have loved you my entire life.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.338
Michael, when you get this,
get over here.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.298
(screaming)

00:57.599 --> 00:59.518
ROSA:
You should be happier.

00:59.518 --> 01:02.229
I am happy, Rosa.
I just...

01:02.229 --> 01:04.314
What are you gonna do tonight?

01:04.314 --> 01:07.317
Well, Usher's hosting SNL.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.569
And then I'm probably gonna try
to score some crack.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.072
And... (laughs)

01:12.072 --> 01:14.283
I'm just kidding.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.451
Look, I promise I'm doing
a lot better, okay?

01:16.451 --> 01:18.245
There's no need
to babysit me.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.205
Not too much.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.873
Don't worry, in that dress,
you'll look every bit

01:21.873 --> 01:23.250
like a virgin on prom night.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.669
Did Dad pick it out?

01:25.669 --> 01:26.962
Yeah.

01:29.131 --> 01:32.426

01:32.426 --> 01:34.428
Oh, my God.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.888
Did you sleep with Kyle
while I was drying out?

01:36.888 --> 01:39.057
Elizabeth.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.393
I'm delighted.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.729
I don't know about Kyle.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.939
You don't know about your
high school boyfriend?

01:45.939 --> 01:47.941
Ay, dios mío. Estás arruinada.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.819
He says he loves me
and he's nice to me,

01:50.819 --> 01:53.405
but he's kind of a jerk
to other people, and...

01:53.405 --> 01:56.658
Listen, listen.
Don't worry about Kyle, okay?

01:56.658 --> 01:58.618
And definitely
don't worry about love.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.705
People are the worst drug.
They hook you, and then,

02:01.705 --> 02:03.749
they make you believe
that they care and they leave,

02:03.749 --> 02:06.001
or they fail you,
or they hurt you on purpose.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.961
Did you and Frederico
have a fight?

02:07.961 --> 02:11.340
No. Frederico is old news,
but just listen to me, okay?

02:11.340 --> 02:14.217
There's a reason that God put
a cage around your heart.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.678
People don't need other people.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.180
We need armor.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.099
Rosa. Seriously.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.517
Who hurt you?

02:22.517 --> 02:23.727
It doesn't matter.

02:23.727 --> 02:24.895
Take off that dress.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.104

02:32.402 --> 02:34.446

02:52.714 --> 02:55.550
You going on the run, Deputy?

02:55.550 --> 02:57.719
Gonna bring these
supplies into town.

02:57.719 --> 02:58.845
It's just water, food.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.263
Yeah, we assume
you're the reason

03:00.263 --> 03:01.598
every transformer
in town's blown.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.730
I've been raging out
for days and I...

03:08.730 --> 03:12.109

destruction and I feel better.

Catcher in the Rye

03:14.152 --> 03:15.862

03:15.862 --> 03:17.197
TVs are down,
figured the hospital

03:17.197 --> 03:18.448
could use
a few books.
Yeah, well,

03:18.448 --> 03:20.200
when you resurrected Liz

03:20.200 --> 03:21.827
or healed her or whatever,

03:21.827 --> 03:24.037
you must have absorbed
some kind of destructive energy.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.372
Now that you released it...

03:25.372 --> 03:26.456
(whispers):
...you're better.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.208
So, what happened?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.127
To piss you off again?
She didn't like your mixtape?

03:30.127 --> 03:33.463
Wait, you guys... You guys
didn't get my voice mail?

03:33.463 --> 03:35.799
Cell service is down.

03:35.799 --> 03:36.967
(exhales)

03:39.469 --> 03:41.638
Liz confronted me last night.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.224
I don't know how she
found out, but she knows.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.227
She knows that Rosa
was killed by an alien.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.354
Damn it.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.482
Okay.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.734
All right.
So what's the plan?

03:54.734 --> 03:57.362
(exhales) Look, this
blackout is my fault, okay?

03:57.362 --> 04:00.699
So let me drop these off
and then I will find Liz

04:00.699 --> 04:02.159
and I'll confess.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.535
Look, she already thinks
I did it.

04:03.535 --> 04:04.995
And if she
keeps digging,

04:04.995 --> 04:06.371
eventually she's
gonna learn everything.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.165
I am out of options here.

04:08.165 --> 04:10.041
Well, I'm not.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.169
I can use my abilities
to influence her to go.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.589
GRANT:
This blackout

04:15.589 --> 04:17.966
is pure alien phenomena.

04:17.966 --> 04:21.303
Government will tout it
as "faulty equipment."

04:21.303 --> 04:23.096
Or a lightning storm.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.892
But it's another sign
that they are amongst us.

04:26.892 --> 04:30.520
Working to undermine
the very fabric of our society.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.232
My alien wave detector bracelet

04:34.232 --> 04:36.443
is your only means to stay safe.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.737
Only $45.

04:38.737 --> 04:39.946
One day only.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.409
(Liz sighs)

04:46.786 --> 04:48.872
Thanks for coming all the way
over here, Frederico.

04:48.872 --> 04:52.334
Um, hey, what is, um...
What's this about?

04:52.334 --> 04:54.461
You want some free ice cream?
'Cause of the blackout.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.463
The freezers are down
so we're getting rid of it.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.006
You said you had
something of mine.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.967
Okay, great; skip the niceties.
(sharp exhale)

05:00.967 --> 05:03.261
I found this.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.388
In in one
of Rosa's hiding spots.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.559
(sighs) Wow.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.645
I know this question
might be strange.

05:11.645 --> 05:16.107
but did you and Rosa get back
together before she died?

05:16.107 --> 05:20.529
No, she was trying to avoid
all of our old crowds.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.280
And her old, um, habits.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.907
I'm sorry-- (stammers)

05:23.907 --> 05:25.325
I don't like thinking
about that time.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.993
I get it, I do.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.287
It's just, I heard she was
seeing someone at the end

05:29.287 --> 05:30.789
and I'm trying
to figure out who it was.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.127
Well, if-if you think
of anything, anything at all.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.171
Yeah...
Really.
It would help.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.506
I would really
appreciate it.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.841
Oh, crap.
Um...

05:41.841 --> 05:43.927
Oh, it's been a decade;
he's fine.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.554
Nope. Uh, sir...

05:45.554 --> 05:48.181
You've got exactly
cinco segundos to get out

05:48.181 --> 05:50.850
or I'll serve you as today's
special, ¡hamburguesa idiota!

05:57.482 --> 05:59.109
VALENTI: Can I help you,
Master Sergeant?

05:59.109 --> 06:01.903
Yeah. Power's been
out 18 hours now.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.405
Still no indication
of a cause?

06:03.405 --> 06:05.407
Nothing to report yet.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.367
I see.

06:07.367 --> 06:11.580
Because my engineers found
evidence of tampering.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.541
VALENTI: Your engineers
have no business

06:14.541 --> 06:15.709
outside the perimeter
of your base.

06:18.336 --> 06:21.631
I had hoped, now that
Roswell is in your hands,

06:21.631 --> 06:24.718
that maybe the military
and the local law enforcement

06:24.718 --> 06:28.221
would have a more,
um, amicable partnership.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.889
(chuckles)

06:29.889 --> 06:32.392
You expected me to be more
amicable than my husband.

06:34.519 --> 06:38.607
Actually...
given Jim's struggles

06:38.607 --> 06:40.442
at the end
of his term,

06:40.442 --> 06:42.527
I was expecting you
to make different choices.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.211
Master Sergeant.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.214
At ease.
Um...

07:03.214 --> 07:07.385
Sheriff Valenti's not
a fan of the military.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.804
Still hasn't warmed up to me
and I've been in town two years.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.473
(chuckles) You served.

07:11.473 --> 07:12.766
I did.

07:12.766 --> 07:13.892
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Deputy...

07:13.892 --> 07:15.310
Cameron.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.896
Manes.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.482
Um, let me ask you.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.025
What do you
make of those?
(clears throat)

07:24.027 --> 07:25.445
Lightning struck
my parents' barn

07:25.445 --> 07:28.073
when I was a kid;
left a burn like that.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.867
There was one of those on every
busted transformer in town.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.955
Criminal mischief, probably.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.250
People here are,
like, deeply bored.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.419
Yeah.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.088
Well, it was nice
to meet you.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.598
MAX:
So what is it like, exactly?

07:53.598 --> 07:54.891
When you get into
someone's head?

07:54.891 --> 07:56.226
I don't want you
to hurt yourself.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.311
No, it-it doesn't hurt.
It's, um...

07:58.311 --> 08:00.855
It's a place where
I have ultimate power.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.400
I make a suggestion
and someone else's thought

08:03.400 --> 08:06.319
or memory just kind of
floats to the surface.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.863
If I'm strong enough,
I can change it.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.573
Influence it.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.118
I don't know if I want you
to violate Liz like that.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.913
Maybe it'll help her.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.874
Remind her what exists
outside Roswell.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.668
Make her stop pressing
an old bruise.

08:23.795 --> 08:26.131
Will she forget me?
No.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.300
Just how she feels about you.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.970
Well, she feels like
I'm a murderer, so...

08:38.643 --> 08:40.687
Playing hooky, Evans?

08:40.687 --> 08:43.440
Been covering for you
with Valenti all morning.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.316
Sorry.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.610
Was a rough night.
Yeah, well,

08:47.610 --> 08:49.904
when people are denied AC
and cold beer in this town,

08:49.904 --> 08:52.615
they start committing crimes
for fun.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.784
So grab your boots
and your badge.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.704
(sharp exhale)

08:59.247 --> 09:00.540
What do you want
to do about Liz?

09:02.667 --> 09:06.046
What I want stopped mattering
a long time ago.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.174
Do it.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.010
Get inside her head.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.887
Send her away.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.933
(monitor beeping,
ventilator hissing)

09:21.060 --> 09:22.854
I'll be right back.

09:22.854 --> 09:25.732
Dr. Kindelay.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.858
I know that kid,
Victor Franco.

09:26.858 --> 09:28.193
What happened?

09:28.193 --> 09:29.569
Cardiac contusion.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.029
There was a car accident.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.448
All the street lights
are down from the blackout.

09:33.448 --> 09:36.242
He needs a pacemaker,
but I can't do it

09:36.242 --> 09:37.619
while the hospital's
on generator power.

09:37.619 --> 09:38.870
It's not stable.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.455
How urgent is the procedure?

09:40.455 --> 09:42.123
The external pacer
that he's hooked up to

09:42.123 --> 09:43.750
will max out in a few hours.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.668
And if we don't have
power back by then,

09:45.668 --> 09:47.796
I don't know how
we can help him.

09:53.802 --> 09:54.928
Thought you weren't
strong enough

09:54.928 --> 09:56.346
to change Liz's mind last night.

09:56.346 --> 09:57.722
That's why we're going
to the Wild Pony.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.099
So I can practice.

10:00.099 --> 10:03.812
You didn't tell Max about
how Liz really feels about him.

10:06.523 --> 10:09.067
It'll hurt less
if he doesn't know.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.616
(door opens, closes)

10:16.616 --> 10:18.284
LIZ: That was
real mature, Dad.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.203
Running Frederico off
like a maniac.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.830
I was trying
to talk to him.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.414
What was he doing here?

10:23.414 --> 10:25.583
No tiene dos dedos de frente.
I told you.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.669
I'm trying to learn more
about Rosa's last few weeks.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.087
You're obsessed.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.296
Meeting up with her drug dealer.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.548
Oh, my God.
Frederico's sober now.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.091
He's dangerous.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.260
Después de niño ahogado,
tapan el pozo,

10:35.260 --> 10:37.512
y ya!
Stop treating me like a child.

10:37.512 --> 10:40.223
You know, maybe Rosa wouldn't
have hidden so much

10:40.223 --> 10:42.058
if you'd trusted us.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.310
Maybe she wouldn't have hiding
places all over town and some

10:44.310 --> 10:46.187
secret boyfriend
she couldn't tell us about.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.939
Maybe I wouldn't
have to do this.

10:47.939 --> 10:51.943
I stopped trusting Rosa when
she started to keep secrets.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.570
Not the other
way around.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.113
When you girls
were little,

10:55.113 --> 10:56.948
I would make churro pancakes,

10:56.948 --> 10:58.449
and you would tell me
everything.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.411
About school, boys,
your friends.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.705
(speaks Spanish)

11:03.705 --> 11:06.207
Then, one day,

11:06.207 --> 11:09.711
she stopped talking.

11:09.711 --> 11:12.005
And she started lying.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.840
Like that.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.343
The end.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.804
Papi? Hey, hey, hey. Papi.

Liz.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.611
I was about to call 911,

11:34.611 --> 11:36.946
and then I thought I might be
putting him on ICE's radar,

11:36.946 --> 11:39.032
and if they picked him up
for something minor,

11:39.032 --> 11:40.491
I would never forgive myself.
Liz.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.035
It's okay.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.162
And most of the computers
have been shut down

11:44.162 --> 11:45.288

11:45.288 --> 11:47.874
so, unfortunately,

11:47.874 --> 11:50.752
his paperwork won't
make it into the system.

Sure. What, how the movie

14:03.885 --> 14:08.431

homage to Metropolis,

21:17.485 --> 21:20.196
Honestly, I came
here to help me.

21:20.196 --> 21:23.949
Step nine of 12 states
you must make amends

21:23.949 --> 21:26.869
with those you have wronged
in your addiction.

21:26.869 --> 21:31.540
And since Rosa is not here,

21:31.540 --> 21:32.583
I can't.

21:35.794 --> 21:38.214
You said to come back
if I thought of anything.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.965
Rosa's backpack.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.384
How long have you had this?
Well,

21:42.384 --> 21:45.387
I, um... I wanted
to get really loaded

21:45.387 --> 21:46.889
one night when I was broke.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.891
I went to one of the
hiding spots she used

21:48.891 --> 21:50.476
to stash her stuff in
the turquoise mines,

21:50.476 --> 21:52.478
and I, I don't know,
I maybe raided it,

21:52.478 --> 21:55.439
like, a... a week
before she passed.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.358
Swiped the backpack,
took the pills,

21:57.358 --> 21:59.318
spent the cash, but
the rest of her stuff

21:59.318 --> 22:00.653
should still be in there.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.488
She was gonna make
a hell of a getaway.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.990
You--

22:04.990 --> 22:07.326
You said you thought she might
have a-a boyfriend, right?

22:10.287 --> 22:13.958
Is there any chance she knew
anyone in Los Alamos?

22:16.001 --> 22:17.545
That ticket's for June 8.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.173
It's the day after she died.

22:40.568 --> 22:42.736
(speaking Spanish)

22:45.531 --> 22:46.866
I know.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.576
I was a dumb kid.

22:48.576 --> 22:50.536
I wouldn't have liked me either.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.080
You're ready to be discharged.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.540
Okay.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.834
You're prediabetic.

22:56.834 --> 22:58.586
We're gonna get
you treatment.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.045
Safely.

23:03.549 --> 23:04.717
(electricity crackles)

23:04.717 --> 23:05.801
(pager beeping)

23:09.346 --> 23:11.348
(monitor alarm beeping)

23:15.436 --> 23:17.146
We lost transcutaneous pacing.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.564
Page Dr. Kindelay; this kid
needs to get into surgery.

23:23.444 --> 23:25.613
You just gonna
stand there, Evans?

23:32.161 --> 23:34.788
(monitor alarm beeping)

23:34.788 --> 23:36.415
His BPM is dropping.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.291
Clear.

23:37.291 --> 23:39.001
Now, Doctor! Clear.

23:39.001 --> 23:40.377
(defibrillator zaps)

23:40.377 --> 23:42.046
We need to get this kid
into surgery.

23:42.046 --> 23:44.006
Dr. Valenti, we cannot operate
with failing power.

23:44.006 --> 23:44.840
KINDELAY: If you can't help
making suggestions,

23:44.840 --> 23:46.342
get out.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.347
Hey.

23:51.347 --> 23:52.765
You okay?

23:52.765 --> 23:55.351
No. People here are suffering,
and what do we do?

23:55.351 --> 23:56.769
We brought a few
water bottles.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.062
Why don't we throw
some paper towels at 'em

23:58.062 --> 23:59.063
while we're at it?

23:59.063 --> 24:00.105
We do what we're told.

24:00.105 --> 24:01.273
We follow orders.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.316
We do the bare minimum.

24:03.901 --> 24:05.319
(groans)

24:05.319 --> 24:06.654
I've done the bare minimum
for years.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.864
I've tried to lay low,
disappear,

24:08.864 --> 24:10.074
no matter who suffers.

24:10.074 --> 24:12.201
Okay, what is going on with you?

24:13.994 --> 24:15.913
I can't do that this time.
Evans.

24:34.682 --> 24:36.684
(screaming)

24:38.060 --> 24:41.146
(transformer booms)

24:41.146 --> 24:43.482
(electricity crackles)

24:46.735 --> 24:48.821
NURSE: Dr. Kindelay, the
hospital's power is back up.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.572
They're prepping an OR
for Victor.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.378
LIZ:
Rosa, seriously, who hurt you?

25:06.547 --> 25:08.006
ROSA:
People are the worst drug.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.633
They hurt you on purpose.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.220
I heard she was seeing someone
at the end,

25:13.220 --> 25:14.138
and I'm trying to figure out
who it was.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.578
Evans.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.248
What the hell?

25:41.248 --> 25:43.751
Max. Max.

25:43.751 --> 25:45.586
Hey, hey. Max.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.088
Oh, is the power back?

25:48.088 --> 25:50.340
Yeah, but just here
at the hospital.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.467
Are you okay?

25:51.467 --> 25:52.509
Yeah. No, I was--

25:52.509 --> 25:53.510
I was messing with that thing.

25:53.510 --> 25:56.346
Must have gotten shocked.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.432
(groaning)

26:20.037 --> 26:22.039
Hey.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.499
I brought your dad home.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.667
I wanted to talk
about a treatment plan.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.464
Are you all right, Liz?

26:32.382 --> 26:33.300
No.

26:37.137 --> 26:40.557
There's this bus ticket that
Rosa's boyfriend got her,

26:40.557 --> 26:41.975
with a note.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.727
I compared the handwriting
from the note

26:43.727 --> 26:45.979
to everybody in her
high school class and ours.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.272
I got nothing.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.525
Then I flipped
to the dedication pages

26:49.525 --> 26:53.028
that our parents made
for us before graduation.

27:03.330 --> 27:05.749
I don't understand.

27:05.749 --> 27:09.628
It was your dad, Kyle.

27:09.628 --> 27:13.924
Your father,
the town sheriff,

27:13.924 --> 27:18.512
was having an affair with
my teenage, drug addict sister.

27:22.099 --> 27:25.769
No, my father was
a good sheriff, a good dad,

27:25.769 --> 27:26.979
and a good husband.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.981
The writing is
exactly the same, Kyle.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.275
The way he capitalizes
certain letters.

27:31.275 --> 27:33.026
Look at this.
Why are you doing this?

27:33.026 --> 27:35.112
Are you so desperate
to clear Max's name

27:35.112 --> 27:36.530
that you'll drag my dad's
through the mud?

27:43.620 --> 27:44.830
You're right.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.082
You're totally right.

27:47.082 --> 27:51.336
My sister never would have
hooked up with a cop.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.838
She hated narcs.

27:52.838 --> 27:56.174
And-and your dad was
definitely not an alien.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.218
So, he didn't kill her.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.595
I was looking for
the wrong clue.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.273
There's something
I haven't told you.

28:19.239 --> 28:21.992
My dad knew about aliens.

28:21.992 --> 28:24.077
That the crash was real,

28:24.077 --> 28:26.204
that not every alien died
in '47.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.584
That's how I got the autopsy.

28:30.584 --> 28:33.545
If he was
sleeping with Rosa,

28:33.545 --> 28:36.548
maybe he conspired, and
maybe she knew too much.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.799
Maybe she was pregnant.

28:37.799 --> 28:39.134
It could have been...
Hey, Kyle.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.345
I am sure

28:41.345 --> 28:42.763
I'm wrong about this.

28:42.763 --> 28:44.389
Okay?

28:44.389 --> 28:46.099
You don't believe that.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.144
Why are you trying
to make me feel better?

28:50.938 --> 28:53.190
I know what it's like
when heroes fall.

28:53.190 --> 28:56.860
Mom, Rosa.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.696
You idolized your dad.

28:59.696 --> 29:01.698
I don't want you
to lose him twice.

29:04.868 --> 29:07.746
You're one of the best people
I know.

29:07.746 --> 29:11.083
You don't deserve that.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.261
You don't want to do this.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.597
I'm a mess.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.140
Trust me.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.059
If you say so.

29:29.059 --> 29:35.691
But maybe we could both
use a distraction.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.359
I mean, there are downsides
to being adults,

29:37.359 --> 29:43.323
like taxes, and parents
having flaws.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.909
But there are perks.

29:45.909 --> 29:49.746
Recreational sex, for example.

29:52.290 --> 29:57.004
♪ Take a breath

29:57.004 --> 30:00.215

(sighs)
Hey.

30:37.294 --> 30:39.796
Drink this.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.131
No.
Drink it.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.424
I need to know
why she hated me.

30:42.424 --> 30:45.761
Rosa Ortecho.

30:45.761 --> 30:47.387
She was avoiding me

30:47.387 --> 30:50.432
on the day she died,
and I don't know why.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.809
You can't get inside the mind
of a dead girl, Isobel.

30:52.809 --> 30:55.395
Besides, we made
a deal, remember?

30:55.395 --> 30:58.732
We never talk about that night.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.984
We never ask questions.

wisdom, experience,

31:23.548 --> 31:25.133
anatomy class.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.676
(chuckles)

31:26.676 --> 31:28.929
Are you gonna apply
for that research position

31:28.929 --> 31:29.930
at the hospital?

31:29.930 --> 31:32.057
(sighs)

31:32.057 --> 31:36.103
I can't believe
I'm making plans to stay, but...

31:36.103 --> 31:38.730
my dad and Rosa.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.107
And Max?

31:40.107 --> 31:42.943
I don't want to talk
about him with you

31:42.943 --> 31:44.111
when I'm not wearing a bra.

31:46.113 --> 31:49.825
I've lived in 14 cities
since high school,

31:49.825 --> 31:53.703
transferred colleges twice,
bailed on every boyfriend.

31:53.703 --> 31:57.040
Something broke in me
when I lost Rosa,

31:57.040 --> 31:59.126
and I've been running
ever since.

32:01.253 --> 32:04.381
But if I could
solve this mystery,

32:04.381 --> 32:06.800
I... I might have a chance

32:06.800 --> 32:11.221
at feeling at home
somewhere again.

32:11.221 --> 32:13.682
I'm tired of almosts
and maybes.

32:13.682 --> 32:14.724
And distractions?

32:17.185 --> 32:18.895
I like having you around.

32:20.814 --> 32:22.649
You make me feel safe.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.529
Look, I still

32:27.529 --> 32:30.198
do not feel safe in your dad's
house with the door closed,

32:30.198 --> 32:32.075
so I'm gonna go.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.828
I'll let you know what
I find out about my father.

32:34.828 --> 32:38.957
My mom's been begging me for
years not to look into his past.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.792
I'm guessing this is why.

32:40.792 --> 32:44.504
I'm so sorry, Kyle.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.756
Me, too.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.054
(sighs heavily)
(door closes)

33:00.645 --> 33:02.939
(insects trilling)

33:05.442 --> 33:06.776
(bell tinkles, door opens)

33:12.282 --> 33:13.366
Hey.

33:13.366 --> 33:15.202
Max.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.872
I just wanted to thank you
for your help today.

33:18.872 --> 33:21.166
Yeah.

33:24.544 --> 33:27.339
I became a doctor
because I wanted to be a hero,

33:27.339 --> 33:28.548
like my dad.

33:28.548 --> 33:30.717
I wanted the glory.

33:30.717 --> 33:33.887
But glory isn't why

33:33.887 --> 33:37.682
you became a cop, is it?

33:37.682 --> 33:40.268
No.

33:41.645 --> 33:45.065
Have a good night.

33:52.072 --> 33:53.490
(bell tinkles)

33:53.490 --> 33:55.617
We're closed.

34:07.128 --> 34:11.132
So Kyle, huh?

34:11.132 --> 34:12.759
Did you tell him about me?

34:12.759 --> 34:14.803
Yes.

34:14.803 --> 34:15.971
And my family?

34:15.971 --> 34:17.347
No, not them.

34:19.307 --> 34:22.310
He saw the-the mark you left
on me and he had questions.

34:22.310 --> 34:25.230
You had lied to me about Rosa
and I was so angry at you.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.982
He was the only one
I could talk to.

34:30.026 --> 34:33.154
I know him. He won't
do anything, unless...

34:33.154 --> 34:35.365
Unless what?

34:35.365 --> 34:38.410
Unless you two
decide I'm a killer?

I'm guessing that's why
the whole town is dark.

34:53.049 --> 34:57.595
I hate that you're hurting, Max,

34:57.595 --> 35:00.015
and I want to believe you.

35:00.015 --> 35:01.558
I...

35:04.227 --> 35:06.438
I don't trust people.

35:06.438 --> 35:09.733
I've been burned
too many times.

35:09.733 --> 35:14.070
I use, I use facts and evidence
to build a cage around my heart.

35:14.070 --> 35:17.240
I-I-I can't help it.
I can't change it, and honestly,

35:17.240 --> 35:20.327
I don't think I would want to.

35:33.465 --> 35:36.968
that you didn't hurt my sister.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.429
But I can't shake the feeling
that you're lying.

35:48.938 --> 35:50.940
I need to ask you something.

35:53.777 --> 35:55.362
I have been

35:55.362 --> 35:58.156
pouring my heart out to you
ever since you got back.

36:00.283 --> 36:02.243
And I need to know.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.623
How do you truly
feel about me, Liz?

36:06.623 --> 36:09.793
I feel this.

36:09.793 --> 36:11.336
Real answer, please.

36:11.336 --> 36:14.964
I feel a lot
of things. I...

36:14.964 --> 36:17.092
But mostly,

36:17.092 --> 36:21.471
I feel...

36:21.471 --> 36:23.014
terrified,

36:23.014 --> 36:27.602
in all kinds
of ways.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.354
That's the truth.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.689
It's the only one
that I can give you right now.

Did you believe a word that
I said to you at the drive-in?

36:42.992 --> 36:44.494
Not about Rosa.

36:46.621 --> 36:50.166
Did you believe me
when I said I love you?

36:50.166 --> 36:52.043
Yes.

36:55.630 --> 36:58.842
Good.

36:58.842 --> 37:02.178
That's what matters.

37:02.178 --> 37:04.764
I hope you take that with you
wherever you go next.

37:04.764 --> 37:05.807
No.

37:09.185 --> 37:10.770
Good-bye, Liz.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.071
(bell tinkles)

37:29.372 --> 37:31.291
(music plays quietly)

37:37.422 --> 37:39.674
No, no, no, please.

37:39.674 --> 37:43.094
I'll sit.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.889
I have a proposition for you.

37:45.889 --> 37:47.515
It's kind of a

37:47.515 --> 37:50.351
"you scratch my back,
I scratch yours" type situation.

37:50.351 --> 37:53.480
I don't really have an itch.

37:53.480 --> 37:56.941
Your friend Charlie does.

37:59.068 --> 38:00.778
Yeah, I know.

38:00.778 --> 38:04.240
It's a shame, it's...

38:04.240 --> 38:05.825
that ugly situation.

38:08.495 --> 38:11.039
But I could help.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.374
If...

38:13.374 --> 38:15.835
If you could help me
with a little access

38:15.835 --> 38:17.837
to the Roswell
Sheriff's Department.

38:28.515 --> 38:30.558
You look better, Papi.

38:30.558 --> 38:35.188
I told you, I'm fine.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.398
I'm sorry I've been
so distant lately.

38:37.398 --> 38:41.152
I've been so caught up in
the people who have let me down

38:41.152 --> 38:43.613
that I forgot about the guy
who's always been there.

38:45.365 --> 38:46.866
I won't do that again.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.916
(chuckles)

38:54.916 --> 38:58.127
Churro pancakes.

38:58.127 --> 39:01.005
They smell wrong.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.340
Oh, they're sugarless

39:02.340 --> 39:03.591
and made with
buckwheat and millet.

39:03.591 --> 39:04.634
They're totally
disgusting.

39:04.634 --> 39:06.761
Kyle says you're
prediabetic,

39:06.761 --> 39:09.305
but I needed to have
one of our pancake talks.

39:09.305 --> 39:12.767
I've been having some
serious boy problems,

39:12.767 --> 39:15.019
and I could really
use your advice.

39:15.019 --> 39:18.731
I know.

39:24.237 --> 39:25.572
(chuckles)

39:25.572 --> 39:30.368
I used to look in the sky
when we were kids

39:30.368 --> 39:32.912
and hope something up there
would save me.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.002
I used to look around
at the people of this town

39:39.002 --> 39:40.503
and hope for
the same thing.

39:40.503 --> 39:44.132
We have each other.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.467
That's it.

39:46.467 --> 39:50.221
Kyle knows about me.

39:50.221 --> 39:53.600
Never should've
told Liz the truth.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.643
Now our secret
is gonna spread.

40:01.983 --> 40:05.236
I don't think I'm strong enough
to change Liz's mind, Max.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.780
And we tried,
I just, uh...

40:07.780 --> 40:09.866
I think we need more time.

40:09.866 --> 40:11.200
We don't have
more time.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.952
We'll figure
something out.
No.

40:12.952 --> 40:14.412
We're not gonna do anything.

40:14.412 --> 40:21.628
Kyle, Liz, Grant frigging Green,

40:21.628 --> 40:24.213
they all want the same thing,

40:24.213 --> 40:26.507
a little green man
that they can put in a cage.

40:26.507 --> 40:27.634
MAX:
You're right.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.304
I'll tell Liz it was me.

40:31.304 --> 40:34.599
No, but thank you.

40:34.599 --> 40:38.061
I'm not gonna let you
martyr yourself.

40:38.061 --> 40:39.520
You got a good life, Max.

40:39.520 --> 40:42.106
Yeah.
You do.

40:42.106 --> 40:43.316
Isobel,

40:43.316 --> 40:45.652
you got Noah.

40:45.652 --> 40:47.820
I got nothing besides
some old scrap metal.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.239
There is no point

40:50.239 --> 40:51.699
in all three of us going down

40:51.699 --> 40:53.576
when only one of us
did the deed.

40:53.576 --> 40:56.120
No, Michael,
we stick together.

40:56.120 --> 40:59.082
Liz Ortecho's
looking for a murderer.

41:01.584 --> 41:03.002
Let's give her one.

41:03.002 --> 41:05.755
I'm gonna confess.

41:08.549 --> 41:10.093
After all...

41:12.220 --> 41:15.473
I'm the one that
killed those girls.
