WEBVTT

00:06.740 --> 00:08.509
Joe: "MELISSA & JOEY"
IS RECORDED IN FRONT

00:08.542 --> 00:10.244
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.278 --> 00:13.714
HEY, SOMEBODY HAD
A FABULOUS NIGHT.

00:13.747 --> 00:16.417
CAN YOU SPOT HER?

00:16.450 --> 00:18.286
WHERE'D YOU GO?

00:18.319 --> 00:19.587
WHERE DIDN'T WE GO?

00:19.620 --> 00:22.490
LET'S SEE... BIG FUN,
MORE FUN, DRINKING FUN,

00:22.523 --> 00:23.991
SALSA FUN.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.594
OOH, GET-OUT-BEFORE-
THE-COPS-COME FUN.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.562
FIVE KINDS OF FUN.

00:28.596 --> 00:31.599
LET ME JUST POINT OUT AT
FUN-THIRTY IN THE MORNING

00:31.632 --> 00:33.667
THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
DATING A 24-YEAR-OLD

00:33.701 --> 00:35.669
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE 24.

00:35.703 --> 00:38.005
I DON'T KNOW. I THINK
IT KIND OF DOES.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.474
YEAH, WHAT'S WRONG WITH
HAVING A GOOD TIME?

00:40.508 --> 00:42.476
JUST NOT A LOT OF TIME.
YOU'RE ALREADY IN YOUR 30s.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.712
YOU KNOW, SIX MONTHS
WITH THE WRONG GUY

00:44.745 --> 00:46.580
IS JUST LIKE SIX MONTHS WASTED.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.582
DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING
FOR MORE OF A SUBSTANTIAL MEAL

00:48.616 --> 00:50.718
INSTEAD OF JUST FILLING
UP WITH JUNK FOOD?

00:50.751 --> 00:54.188
CAN I HELP IT IF JUNK FOOD
CAN'T KEEP ITS HANDS OFF ME?

00:54.222 --> 00:58.126
BESIDES, GEORGE IS THE
RIGHT GUY FOR RIGHT NOW.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.627
WOW, CHECKMATE.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.730
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN
COME BACK FROM...

01:02.763 --> 01:06.434
NO, YOU CAN'T. SO SPEAKING OF WASTING
TIME, WHAT DID YOU DO TONIGHT?

01:06.467 --> 01:08.769
WATCH LINGERIE FOOTBALL?

01:08.802 --> 01:11.139
NO, SEASON'S OVER.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.507
WE'LL GET 'EM NEXT YEAR.

01:13.541 --> 01:16.677
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS, LONGO?
- NO COOL WRISTBANDS?

01:16.710 --> 01:19.513
NO, YOU THINK EVERYONE SHOULD
LIVE THEIR LIVES YOUR WAY.

01:19.547 --> 01:23.050
NO, I'M JUST SAYING YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING
OUT FOR MORE OF A LONG-TERM GUY.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.652
- THAT'S ALL.
- WHAT, A HUSBAND?

01:24.685 --> 01:26.320
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.622
WHY? I'VE ALREADY GOT AN
ANNOYING KNOW-IT-ALL GUY

01:28.656 --> 01:32.160
WHO SITS ON MY COUCH THAT I DON'T
HAVE SEX WITH. WHAT MORE DO I NEED?

01:33.294 --> 01:35.696
HONEY, WILL YOU GRAB ME A BEER?

02:02.756 --> 02:05.125
SCHOOL BLOG, REALLY?
THE SCHOOL BLOG

02:05.159 --> 02:07.661
EXPECTING TO SEE AND
YET FOUND NOTHING

02:07.695 --> 02:09.630
AND YOU'RE WONDERING WHY?

02:09.663 --> 02:11.499
NOT ANYMORE.

02:11.532 --> 02:14.768
- I TRIED TO WARN YOU.
OF A JOB.U DID A HELL

02:14.802 --> 02:17.638
MR. SHAMTOUB AND I
CANNOT WORK WITH ROMAN.

02:17.671 --> 02:21.342
SO NOTHING GETS ON THE BLOG
MY BRILLIANT STUFF, 'T LIKE

02:21.375 --> 02:25.246
AND I DON'T LIKE
BECAUSE IT'S STUPID.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.448
CAN'T YOU GUYS WITH EACH OTHER?

02:27.481 --> 02:29.417
YOU DON'T LEARN, DO YOU?

02:29.450 --> 02:31.819
YOU CAN'T COLLABORATE
NOT LISTEN TO YOU.LL

02:31.852 --> 02:34.222
HE DOESN'T EVEN LET
ME FINISH A SENTENCE.

02:34.255 --> 02:37.725
- YEAH, I CAN'T STAND...
- IT'S JUST SO FRUSTRATING.

02:37.758 --> 02:41.595
I BET. HEY, I LOVE SOMETHING
DIFFERENT WITH IT?

02:41.629 --> 02:44.232
NO, DON'T TRY TO DISTRACT ME
BY TALKING ABOUT MY HAIR.

02:44.265 --> 02:47.768
NO NO NO, IT'S SO SHINY. ARE
YOU USING SOMETHING NEW?

02:47.801 --> 02:49.770
YEAH, IT'S CALLED
STRAWBERRY-SCENTED ANGER.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.805
OH WELL, IT IS WORKING FOR YOU.

02:53.874 --> 02:57.678
UH-OH, NANNY IN A SUIT.
EIGHT MORE WEEKS OF WINTER?

02:57.711 --> 03:00.414
HA, THAT'S... NO, I
ACTUALLY HAVE A MEETING.

03:00.448 --> 03:03.751
HANDING OUT MY BUSINESS CARD
LAST WEEK YIELDED A FEW CALLS.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.819
LONGO'S GETTING
BACK INTO THE GAME.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.422
I MAY BE DOING SOME
WITH THIS STARTUP.NG

03:08.456 --> 03:11.625
WELL, GOOD LUCK. YOU
HAVE A JOB INTERVIEW.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.594
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
HIDE THINGS FROM ME.

03:13.627 --> 03:16.497
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE
WITH GEORGERNY HEAVEN

03:16.530 --> 03:20.601
AND NOTHING ELSE MATTERS,
I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.Y?

03:20.634 --> 03:22.370
- WHAT'S THIS?
HAVE THAT, PLEASE?

03:22.403 --> 03:24.638
AN ANNIVERSARY CARD?
WHOSE ANNIVERSARY IS IT?

03:24.672 --> 03:26.874
- MEL. TIFFANY? FFANY."

03:26.907 --> 03:29.743
YOU'RE SENDING AN ANNIVERSARY
CARD TO YOUR EX-WIFE? WHY?

03:29.777 --> 03:32.313
IF YOU HAVE TO KNOW,
YESTERDAY I GOT A POSTCARD

03:32.346 --> 03:34.248
FROM THE CHALET WE
WENT ON OUR HONEYMOON,

03:34.282 --> 03:37.518
AND IT SAID, "WE MISS YOU.
COME SKI US AGAIN."

03:37.551 --> 03:40.921
I GUESS THEY DIDN'T HEAR
EACH OTHER.PPED SKIING

03:40.954 --> 03:43.657
I AM JUST REACHING OUT ALL RIGHT?
OUR ANNIVERSARY,

03:43.691 --> 03:45.693
AND I FOUND A CARD WITH
AN APPROPRIATE MESSAGE.

03:45.726 --> 03:49.397
YOU FOUND A CARD THAT SAYS,
OUT, YOU GOLD-DIGGING BITCH"?

03:49.430 --> 03:51.832
LOOK, I'M JUST TRYING TO
BE A FRIEND HERE, OKAY,

03:51.865 --> 03:53.767
ON A DAY WHEN SHE'S
GONNA BE SAD AND LONELY

03:53.801 --> 03:55.636
AND PROBABLY WATCHING THAT VIDEO
WE MADE ON OUR HONEYMOON.

03:55.669 --> 03:59.640
MY BAGEL JUST CAME BACK ON ME.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.809
NO, WE RODE OUR BIKES
TO THE TOP OF A VOLCANO

04:01.842 --> 04:04.478
AND A GUY VIDEOTAPED US THERE
AT THE TOP OF THE CRATER...

04:04.512 --> 04:06.580
DOING IT.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.582
I'M KIDDING. I JUST
WANTED TO SEE THAT FACE.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.718
- JOE, THIS IS A BAD IDEA.
- WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

04:10.751 --> 04:13.654
I'M JUST GONNA SWING BY HER PLACE
AFTER MY MEETING AND GIVE IT TO HER.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.789
THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT...
YOU GIVING IT TO HER.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.491
I'M GONNA MAIL HER THIS.

04:17.525 --> 04:20.394
MEL, I DIDN'T EVEN SEAL
THAT ENVELOPE YET.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.863
YOU SHOULD NOT BE LICKING
ANYTHING THAT SAYS TIFFANY ON IT.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.769
SO ALL THESE PIECES I
SUBMITTED ARE TERRIBLE.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.838
IT'S JUST MY OPINION,

04:30.871 --> 04:32.740
WHICH IS ALWAYS CORRECT.

04:32.773 --> 04:36.744
EVERY STORY, EVERY POEM, EVERY
SINGLE LINE IS TOTAL SUCKAGE?

04:36.777 --> 04:39.647
NO, YOU KNOW, THERE
ARE RANDOM MOMENTS

04:39.680 --> 04:42.750
OF UNINTENDED HILARITY.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.852
YOU THINK IF YOU ACT
SMARTER AND BETTER,

04:44.885 --> 04:48.489
YOU'RE SOMEHOW...
SMARTER AND BETTER.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.760
YES, AND YEAH.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.495
THOSE PIECES MAY NOT BE PERFECT,

04:54.528 --> 04:57.565
BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A CHANCE.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.000
- SO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE A CHANCE?
- YEAH.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.803
- YOU REALLY WANT ME TO TAKE A CHANCE?
- YEAH.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.838
PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE
YOUR MOUTH IS.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.777
WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?

05:10.778 --> 05:15.449
SO, UM, YOU WERE REALLY JUST
TALKING ABOUT THE BLOG?

05:15.483 --> 05:17.418
YEAH.

05:17.451 --> 05:20.721
BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT
METAPHORS, SO I THOUGHT... I'M SORRY.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.794
I'M CONFUSED.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.996
- WHY DON'T WE CLEAR THINGS UP?
- YEAH.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.572
KNOCK KNOCK.

05:38.606 --> 05:42.309
MR. SHAMTOUB, WE WERE JUST...

05:42.342 --> 05:44.745
INSPECTING EACH OTHER'S
LIPS FOR DEFECTS?

05:44.778 --> 05:47.014
I THINK NOT.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.784
( doorbell rings )

05:52.686 --> 05:54.455
GEORGE, ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO BE GOING OUT TONIGHT?

05:54.488 --> 05:57.658
NO NO NO. TONIGHT'S YOUR NIGHT OFF.
REST UP FOR WHAT'S TO COME.

05:57.691 --> 06:01.795
- WHAT'S TO COME?
- WE JUST GOT INVITED TO A PARTY.

06:01.829 --> 06:04.965
"MEET THE NEW GIRLFRIEND." THAT'S SO SWEET.
WHO'S GOT A NEW GIRLFRIEND?

06:04.998 --> 06:07.868
JUST SOME GUY NAMED ME.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.037
AHA!

06:10.070 --> 06:14.542
YEAH, SO THIS GUY, ME, HE'S A LOT OF FUN.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE HIM.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.044
HE'S THROWING A PARTY RIGHT
HERE SO THAT ALL HIS FRIENDS

06:17.077 --> 06:18.679
CAN MEET HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.481
THERE'S THAT WORD AGAIN.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.884
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CALLING
IT AFTER ONLY 12 DAYS?

06:23.917 --> 06:26.720
AM I IN TROUBLE? 'CAUSE I
ALREADY SENT OUT THE EVITE.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.889
NO, IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.358
I WAS WORRIED YOU MIGHT BE
THINKING THAT I'M GOING TOO FAST.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.695
WHAT? TOO FAST? WHO'S FAST?
NOT YOU.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.765
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE SENT OUT THE
INVITE WITHOUT RUNNING IT BY YOU FIRST,

06:37.798 --> 06:39.733
BUT I WAS JUST SO EXCITED.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.669
SO YOU'RE OKAY WITH IT?

06:41.702 --> 06:44.505
YEAH, I MEAN, WHAT'S NOT
TO BE OKAY WITH, YOU KNOW?

06:44.538 --> 06:47.841
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, I AM YOUR...

06:47.875 --> 06:50.778
- GIRLFRIEND.
- YOU SAID IT.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.412
- OKAY, I GOTTA GO.
- ALL RIGHT.

06:52.446 --> 06:53.981
HEY, MEL, I GOT SOME GREAT NEWS.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.817
WHOOPS. DID I JUST INTERRUPT
ANOTHER MAGICAL MOMENT?

06:56.850 --> 06:59.687
- WOULD THAT STOP YOU?
- HONESTLY, NO.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.823
SO MY INTERVIEW WENT AWESOME. THEY DIDN'T
EVEN CARE THAT I WORKED FOR SCANLON.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.859
THEY SAID, "THAT WAS THE PAST.
WE ARE PRIDEMORE FINANCIAL.

07:05.893 --> 07:09.630
WE LOOK TOWARD THE FUTURE, AND THAT FUTURE
JUST MIGHT INCLUDE YOU, JOE LONGO."

07:09.663 --> 07:11.765
- WAY TO SCORE, JOE.
- YEAH, YOU TOO, BUDDY.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.701
I MEAN, THANK YOU.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.803
WELL, I HOPE YOU CAN
MAKE THE PARTY.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.138
- WHAT PARTY?
- SHE'LL TELL YOU.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.674
- LATER.
- LATER.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.011
- WHAT PARTY IS HE TALKING ABOUT?
- ( cell phone beeps )

07:24.044 --> 07:26.914
IT'S NOTHING. IT'S JUST
A LITTLE GATHERING.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.482
I JUST GOT AN EVITE.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.752
FROM GEORGE.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.954
"COME MEET MY NEW GIRLFRIEND."

07:33.987 --> 07:37.691
- ARE YOU THE NEW GIRLFRIEND?
- UH-HUH.

07:37.725 --> 07:40.928
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU DON'T LOOK
100% TOTALLY COMFY WITH THAT.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.930
I'M COMFS. I'M SUPER COMFS.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.998
YEAH? WELL, YOU BETTER
TELL YOUR FACE,

07:45.032 --> 07:47.768
BECAUSE IT DON'T LOOK TOO COMFS.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.671
IT MAKES SENSE. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
GOING OUT FOUR, FIVE MINUTES NOW.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.673
WELL, ALMOST TWO WEEKS.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.142
TWO WEEKS? THAT'S
LIKE HALF HIS LIFE.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.977
- THIS IS NOT ABOUT HIS AGE.
- NO, YOU SURE?

07:57.010 --> 07:59.446
THE YOUNG GUY'S NOT GOING A
LITTLE TOO FAST FOR YOU?

07:59.479 --> 08:00.948
NO, HE'S MOVING JUST RIGHT.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.652
YOU KNOW, AND ANYTIME HE
WANTS, HE CAN CALL ME THAT.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.219
OKAY, WELL, THEN WE
BOTH GOT GOOD NEWS.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.221
BECAUSE I AM THIS CLOSE
TO GETTING A NEW JOB,

08:08.255 --> 08:11.692
AND YOU ARE THIS CLOSE TO BEING
ABLE TO SAY THE WORD "GIRLFRIEND."

08:24.872 --> 08:27.040
EXCUSE ME. HI.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.577
WASN'T THIS PRIDEMORE FINANCIAL?

08:29.610 --> 08:32.580
THEY CLEARED OUT,
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT...

08:32.613 --> 08:34.582
SO FAST THEY LEFT SKID MARKS.

08:34.615 --> 08:37.050
TURNED OUT THEY DIDN'T
HAVE THE FINANCING.

08:37.084 --> 08:40.688
YEAH, BUT I HAD A MEETING
TODAY WITH THE C.E.O.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.990
OH, YEAH, SURE THAT'S
STILL ON THE SCHEDULE.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.826
YEAH, IT'S RIGHT AFTER MY
DATE WITH JENNIFER LOPEZ.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.127
THEY CAN'T BE GONE.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.997
NO, I HAD AN INTERVIEW
AND I NAILED IT.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.766
OH, I'M SORRY. I ALMOST
COMPLETELY FORGOT.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.535
YEAH, THEY LEFT A
MESSAGE FOR YOU.

08:55.569 --> 08:56.870
LOOK AROUND.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.878
SO I TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT
GONNA VALIDATE MY PARKING?

09:16.990 --> 09:19.159
- ABOUT TIME.
- UH-OH.

09:19.192 --> 09:22.796
- SIT DOWN.
- BOY TROUBLE? WHAT'S HIS NAME?

09:22.830 --> 09:25.833
- MR. SHAMTOUB.
- A TEACHER? OH MY GOD!

09:25.866 --> 09:29.302
NO. NO NO, IT'S ROMAN.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.672
WE WERE KISSING AND MR.
SHAMTOUB CAUGHT US.

09:31.705 --> 09:34.307
WHOA, I THOUGHT YOU AND
ROMAN HATED EACH OTHER.

09:34.341 --> 09:37.144
SO NOW YOU HAVE TO LIKE
SOMEONE TO KISS THEM?

09:37.177 --> 09:39.279
NO, GOOD POINT. PROCEED.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.148
OKAY, MR. SHAMTOUB DOESN'T
WANT TWO STUDENTS

09:41.181 --> 09:43.651
WHO ARE HAVING "A THING" LEFT
ALL ALONE IN THE RESOURCE ROOM

09:43.684 --> 09:45.252
FOR NO REASON.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.054
A COUPLE OF
PREGNANCIES, A LAWSUIT,

09:47.087 --> 09:50.724
AND PEOPLE MAKE UP
THESE IDIOTIC RULES.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.293
SO YOU WANT ROMAN
TO ASK YOU OUT?

09:53.326 --> 09:55.763
YES. NO. GOD, KEEP UP.

09:55.796 --> 09:59.867
MR. SHAMTOUB SAYS THAT ONE OF
US HAS TO RESIGN AS EDITOR,

09:59.900 --> 10:01.869
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ME.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.805
- SO IT'LL BE ROMAN?
- NO, HE'S NOT GONNA DO IT.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.140
SO ALL THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE
OF ONE LITTLE KISS?

10:07.174 --> 10:08.842
ACTUALLY IT WAS TWO.

10:08.876 --> 10:11.578
THREE IF YOU COUNT
THE THIRD ONE.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.281
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

10:14.314 --> 10:16.616
I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S WHY
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.052
REALLY? YOU WANTED
MY OPINION ON THIS?

10:19.086 --> 10:21.021
NO, I JUST WANTED
TO HEAR MYSELF TALK

10:21.054 --> 10:24.257
SO MAYBE I COULD FIGURE THINGS OUT.
NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOU.

10:26.226 --> 10:29.029
I LIKE IT BETTER
WHEN IT'S ABOUT ME.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.099
WOW, WHAT'S THIS? YOU ACTUALLY
WENT GROCERY SHOPPING?

10:32.132 --> 10:34.067
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK YOU
COULD FIND THE STORE.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.635
JUST BUYING STUFF
FOR THE PARTY...

10:35.669 --> 10:37.270
YOU KNOW, THE MEET-THE-ME PARTY.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.072
SO HOW'D THE INTERVIEW GO?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.874
IT WENT IN A U-HAUL IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.776
THE COMPANY WENT BUST
AND THEY TOOK OFF.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.878
- JOE, I'M SO SORRY.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

10:44.912 --> 10:48.015
SO MY CAREER IS DEAD.
MY MARRIAGE IS SHOT.

10:48.048 --> 10:52.019
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THE GOOD NEWS IS
THAT I'VE OFFICIALLY HIT ROCK BOTTOM.

10:52.052 --> 10:55.756
- AND IN THAT, MEL, COMES A CERTAIN SERENITY.
- ( cell phone rings )

10:55.789 --> 10:57.257
LONGO.

10:57.290 --> 11:00.160
MR. LONGO, THIS IS
ANGELO AT VALENTINO'S.

11:00.193 --> 11:04.097
I'M CALLING TO CONFIRM YOUR RESERVATION
FOR TONIGHT AT YOUR USUAL TABLE.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.398
RESERVATION? WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:05.432 --> 11:07.400
I SEE THAT IT WAS MRS. LONGO

11:07.434 --> 11:09.369
WHO MADE THE RESERVATION.
MY MISTAKE.

11:09.402 --> 11:12.672
I AM SO VERY SORRY.
PLEASE FORGET I CALLED.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.174
- WAIT A MINUTE, ANGELO. ANGELO, WAIT A MINUTE.
- ( clicks )

11:14.207 --> 11:16.710
HELLO, ANGELO.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.011
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

11:18.045 --> 11:20.948
TIFFANY IS USING OUR STANDING
ANNIVERSARY RESERVATION

11:20.981 --> 11:22.682
TO TAKE SOME NEW GUY OUT.

11:22.716 --> 11:25.418
WELL, SHOULDN'T SHE BE ABLE
TO MOVE ON WITH HER LIFE?

11:25.452 --> 11:28.756
YES, BUT NOT AT OUR TABLE AT OUR
RESTAURANT ON OUR ANNIVERSARY.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.224
THAT'S LIKE SLEEPING WITH
ANOTHER GUY IN OUR BED.

11:31.258 --> 11:34.127
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR SERENITY?
- SHE SUCKED IT OUT OF ME.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.969
- YOU QUIT.
- NO, YOU QUIT.

11:42.002 --> 11:45.973
HOW ABOUT A COMPROMISE?
YOU QUIT AND I DON'T.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.441
I'M A JUNIOR. I'LL BE
APPLYING TO COLLEGES FIRST

11:48.475 --> 11:50.778
AND I NEED TO BE EDITOR MORE.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.946
YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
MORE TIME TO APPLY TO COLLEGES?

11:52.980 --> 11:54.247
BY QUITTING.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.716
WHY ARE WE MAKING
THIS SUCH A BIG DEAL?

11:56.750 --> 11:58.718
BECAUSE OF A COUPLE OF KISSES?

11:58.752 --> 12:01.121
I KNOW. IT'S CRAZY.

12:01.154 --> 12:04.724
ALTHOUGH THAT LAST ONE ROCKED.

12:04.758 --> 12:08.061
OKAY, IT'S NOT AN S.A.T.
WORD, BUT IT'S ACCURATE.

12:08.095 --> 12:11.031
TRUE, BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE
BLOG, WE CAN'T DO THAT AGAIN.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.067
- NO, EVER.
- SO THIS NON-RELATIONSHIP IS OVER.

12:14.101 --> 12:17.037
- DEAD AND BURIED.
- YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN

12:17.070 --> 12:19.306
MAKE THIS WORK AS CO-EDITORS.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.875
- WHICH IS ALL I CARE ABOUT.
- YEAH, ME TOO.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.911
SO.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.181
LET'S NOT RISK IT.

12:30.918 --> 12:34.254
( pop music playing )

12:36.924 --> 12:40.760
HEY, I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS WAS
GONNA BE A SMALL GET-TOGETHER.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.096
I DID, BUT YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE CALL PEOPLE.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.765
THEN THEY CALL PEOPLE
AND THE WORD GETS OUT.

12:45.799 --> 12:48.235
TRISTAN, EMILY, GET OVER HERE.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.871
MEET MY GIRLFRIEND. THIS
IS HER, MY GIRLFRIEND.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.073
YEAH, DON'T CALL ME THAT.
IT'S SO FORMAL.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.175
JUST CALL ME MEL.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.911
SO I'M JUST GONNA GET SOME
OF THE STUFF OUT OF HERE.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.482
HEY, LITTLE DUDE,
WE RAN OUT OF GUAC,

13:02.515 --> 13:05.953
SO DO US A SOLID... RUN TO
THE STORE AND PICK SOME UP.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.088
YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT I
LIVE FOR, TO DO YOU A SOLID.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.157
IGNORE THEM, SWEETIE.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.160
IT'S JUST KIND OF WEIRD WITH
ALL THESE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.963
NOW RUN TO THE STORE
AND GET SOME GUAC.

13:15.996 --> 13:19.166
EXCUSE ME. WOW, LOOK
AT THIS TURNOUT.

13:19.199 --> 13:22.102
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT SPRING BREAK
WAS COMING TO YOU THIS YEAR.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.138
I THINK IT'S SWEET THAT
GEORGE HAS A LOT OF FRIENDS.

13:25.172 --> 13:28.275
- THEY'RE ALL HERE TO MEET THE GIRLFRIEND.
- THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.177
LOOK AT THE TWO OF US, HUH, MEL?

13:30.210 --> 13:32.479
OLD AND OVERDRESSED.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.315
- YOU'RE COMING TO THE PARTY?
- NO, I'M JUST PASSING THROUGH.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.784
PLUS, VALENTINO'S
HAS A DRESS CODE.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.854
VALENTINO'S? WAIT, YOU'RE
NOT SERIOUSLY GONNA SHOW UP

13:40.888 --> 13:42.522
AT TIFFANY'S DATE, ARE YOU?

13:42.555 --> 13:44.791
YEAH, I WANNA SEE WHO SHE'S
DESECRATING MY ANNIVERSARY WITH.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.793
I'M SORT OF
SENTIMENTAL THAT WAY.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.795
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
I WON'T LET YOU.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.132
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE 5,000
NEW FRIENDS TO ATTEND TO HERE.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.134
NO NO NO. IF YOU GO,
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.037
ARE YOU CRAZY? YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE YOUR
HOUSE FULL OF ALL THESE STRANGERS?

13:57.070 --> 13:59.873
GEORGE WILL WATCH THE PLACE.
HE'S VERY MATURE. I TRUST HIM.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.009
HEY, LISTEN,

14:02.042 --> 14:05.045
CAN YOU GUYS TELL
GEORGE THAT HIS GIRL...

14:05.078 --> 14:07.347
MEL HAD TO GO TO
VALENTINO'S REAL QUICK

14:07.380 --> 14:09.816
BECAUSE MY NANNY DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO BE DIVORCED, OKAY?

14:09.849 --> 14:12.185
- THANKS.
- WHO'S GEORGE?

14:12.219 --> 14:13.921
I DON'T KNOW. WHO
WAS THAT BLONDE?

14:13.954 --> 14:16.890
I DON'T KNOW. SHE'S PRETTY
HOT FOR AN OLD LADY.

14:29.269 --> 14:32.472
- ( classical music playing )
- THERE SHE IS.

14:32.505 --> 14:36.309
LOOK AT THAT... AT OUR
TABLE WITH HIM EATING.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.877
JOE, THINK LONG AND HARD
BEFORE YOU DO THIS.

14:37.911 --> 14:40.013
OKAY, I'M DOING IT.

14:40.047 --> 14:43.283
NO, SOMETIMES TURNING AND RUNNING IS
THE MOST COURAGEOUS THING YOU CAN DO.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.986
BE A MAN... RUN.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.321
I'M SORRY, MEL, I JUST
CANNOT LET THIS THING GO.

14:51.158 --> 14:52.559
HELLO, TIFFANY.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.327
HELLO, BROKEN HOME WRECKER.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.996
JOE! MEL!

14:56.029 --> 14:58.198
HI, TIFFANY. IT'S ALWAYS
A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU,

14:58.231 --> 15:01.268
EVEN UNDER PAINFULLY
AWKWARD CIRCUMSTANCES.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.203
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE?

15:03.236 --> 15:05.905
I JUST WANNA SEE WHAT GUY YOU'RE
CELEBRATING MY ANNIVERSARY WITH.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.607
- HIS NAME IS CARSON.
- I BET IT IS.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.309
I DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE.

15:09.342 --> 15:12.445
YEAH, ME EITHER, BUT UNFORTUNATELY
WE GOT A WHOLE TRUCKLOAD OF IT HERE.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.347
SO THIS IS HOW YOU
ACKNOWLEDGE OUR ANNIVERSARY?

15:14.381 --> 15:16.283
BY SHOWING UP AND
EMBARRASSING ME?

15:16.316 --> 15:19.486
- EMBARRASSING YOU? EMBARRASSING YOU?
- JOE, YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.589
LUCKILY, CARSON CALLED

15:22.622 --> 15:25.392
AND SAID THIS WAS NO NIGHT
FOR ME TO BE ALONE.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.028
WHAT A HUMANITARIAN, TAKING YOU
OUT ON A DATE ON OUR ANNIVERSARY.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.897
- EXCUSE ME.
- WHO ARE YOU?

15:30.930 --> 15:33.066
- ELAINE.
- MY WIFE.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.234
- WIFE?
- WIFE.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.537
WIFE. OH, I THOUGHT WE
WERE ALL SAYING IT.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.041
THAT'S MY SEAT.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.609
SO THIS ISN'T A DATE?

15:42.642 --> 15:45.645
ARE THERE USUALLY THREE
PLACE SETTINGS ON A DATE?

15:47.014 --> 15:48.615
THE LEAST YOU COULD HAVE
DONE WAS ACKNOWLEDGE

15:48.648 --> 15:50.383
OUR ANNIVERSARY IN
SOME SMALL WAY.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.219
I DID. I SENT A CARD.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.254
WHAT CARD?

15:57.024 --> 15:59.092
OOPSIE.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.460
HOLD ON.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.330
REALLY GOTTA CLEAN
THIS THING OUT.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.066
HEY, MOVIE STUBS... "INCEPTION."

16:06.099 --> 16:08.535
I DIDN'T GET IT.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.670
LOOK, JUST GO AHEAD, EAT.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.205
BINGO!

16:12.239 --> 16:15.542
HERE IT IS. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

16:15.575 --> 16:19.346
OOH, WAIT, YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE'S A PHONE
NUMBER THERE. I AM GONNA NEED THAT.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.953
TIFFANY, LOOK, I OWE
YOU AN APOLOGY.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.222
- I SHOULD HAVE NEVER DOUBTED...
- I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.458
YOU KNOW, IT'S TIMES
LIKE THIS, JOE LONGO,

16:31.491 --> 16:35.228
THAT I WISH WE WERE STILL MARRIED
SO I COULD TELL YOU IT'S OVER.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.099
TIFFANY, I...

16:39.132 --> 16:41.134
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.673
YOU KNOW THE UPSIDE TO THIS
WHOLE HORRIBLE EVENING?

16:48.141 --> 16:50.277
UNTOUCHED CRAB CAKES.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.645
DELICIOUS.

16:54.147 --> 16:57.317
HEY, YOUNG DUDE, YOU
BRING THE GUACS?

16:57.350 --> 16:58.751
DID I BRING THE GUACS?

16:58.785 --> 17:01.221
YEAH YEAH, I BROUGHT THE GUACS.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.756
AND I ALMOST GOT RUN OVER ON
MY BIKE 'CAUSE I WAS CARRYING

17:03.790 --> 17:06.126
SIX BAGS OF GROCERIES
AND MY LIGHT BURNED OUT

17:06.159 --> 17:07.760
AND EVERY DRIVER IN TOLEDO

17:07.794 --> 17:10.029
DECIDED TO PLAY LET'S-SEE-
HOW-CLOSE-WE-CAN-GET-

17:10.063 --> 17:12.299
TO-THE-KID-ON-THE-BIKE-
WHO'S-RISKING-HIS-LIFE-

17:12.332 --> 17:14.334
TO-BRING-HOME-THE-GUACS.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.705
- THE KID BROUGHT THE GUACS!
- ( cheering )

17:19.739 --> 17:21.608
ANYBODY SEEN MEL?

17:21.641 --> 17:24.177
HEY, ARE YOU GEORGE?

17:24.211 --> 17:26.045
YES.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.715
AN EXCITING NIGHT, EH, MR.
LONGO?

17:28.748 --> 17:31.251
YES, ANGELO. THANK YOU.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.722
I WENT A LITTLE OVERBOARD COMING
DOWN HERE, DIDN'T I, MEL?

17:35.755 --> 17:38.057
WHO CAN SAY?

17:38.091 --> 17:40.059
YEAH, YOU DID.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.795
WHY DOES IT HURT SO BAD TO WATCH
SOMEONE MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIFE

17:42.829 --> 17:45.265
WHEN YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT
THE RIGHT PERSON FOR YOU?

17:45.298 --> 17:47.400
I THINK WHEN TWO PEOPLE
AREN'T MEANT TO BE,

17:47.434 --> 17:50.470
AT SOME POINT YOU
JUST GOTTA LET IT GO.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.704
- YEAH.
- ( glasses clink )

17:51.738 --> 17:55.108
- MEL, THERE YOU ARE.
- GEORGE.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.777
- WHAT'S GOING ON? ARE YOU GUYS ON A DATE?
- WHAT? NO!

17:57.810 --> 17:59.679
COME ON, MAN, THERE'S THREE
PLACE SETTINGS HERE.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.315
JEEZ, DOESN'T ANYBODY
COUNT DINNERWARE ANYMORE?

18:03.516 --> 18:06.119
OH, YEAH. WELL, YOU
LEFT THE PARTY.

18:06.153 --> 18:09.189
- I THOUGHT MEETING MY FRIENDS WAS IMPORTANT TO YOU.
- IT IS.

18:09.222 --> 18:12.091
MEL, IF I MAY? HEY, GEORGE.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.196
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK MEL'S A LITTLE
OVER THE WHOLE BIG PARTY THING.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.831
SO WHY DON'T YOU DO THIS? WHY DON'T YOU
SIT DOWN HERE IN THIS CHAIR TONIGHT

18:18.865 --> 18:20.833
AND HAVE A NICE LITTLE
PARTY FOR TWO, ALL RIGHT?

18:20.867 --> 18:23.570
GEORGE, WE SHOULD REALLY
GET BACK TO YOUR PARTY.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.739
NO, YOU KNOW,

18:26.773 --> 18:28.775
I WAS THINKING MAYBE
WE COULD STAY HERE.

18:28.808 --> 18:32.312
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PARTY.
I JUST CARE ABOUT YOU, MEL.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.683
NOW WOULD BE PROBABLY A
GOOD TIME TO SIT DOWN.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.218
OH YEAH, SURE.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.788
YOU SURE YOU WON'T JOIN US?

18:41.821 --> 18:44.123
YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT
WOULD BE ROMANTIC.

18:44.157 --> 18:47.093
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, YOU TWO.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.095
HEY, THANK YOU.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.430
YEAH.

18:50.463 --> 18:54.301
LOOK, I KNOW I WAS PUSHING
A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

18:54.334 --> 18:57.237
I'LL STOP USING THE "G"
WORD UNTIL YOU'RE READY.

18:57.270 --> 19:00.373
THANK YOU. YOU'RE A
VERY CARING BOYFRIEND.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.108
BOYFRIEND?

19:02.141 --> 19:04.577
SO THAT WOULD MAKE YOU MY...

19:04.611 --> 19:06.613
BITCH?

19:07.880 --> 19:09.682
GIRLFRIEND.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.319
ALL RIGHT, I HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE
WITH THE "G" WORD BEFORE,

19:12.352 --> 19:16.823
BUT YOU KNOW, I'VE GROWN A
LOT IN THE LAST 10 MINUTES.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.459
THIS IS NICE, JUST THE
TWO OF US, YOU KNOW?

19:19.492 --> 19:21.361
A REAL GROWN-UP EVENING.

19:21.394 --> 19:25.198
$11 FOR SOUP?!

19:27.800 --> 19:30.169
I JUST READ YOUR
ANNIVERSARY CARD.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.605
I HAD NO IDEA YOU FELT
THAT WAY, JOJO-BE.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.308
I CAN'T STAY MAD AT YOU.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.510
I WANT YOU MORE THAN ANY MAN
I'VE EVER WANTED IN MY LIFE.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.846
TIFFANY, THIS MAY NOT BE
THE BEST MOMENT TO...

19:41.948 --> 19:43.916
IT'S A GREAT MOMENT.
NOW COME ON.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.553
- LET'S GO INTO THE RESTROOM LIKE OLD TIMES.
- YEAH, OKAY.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.258
- LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN, MR. AND MRS. LONGO.
- THANK YOU, ANGELO.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.801
( bell rings )

20:01.834 --> 20:04.871
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA PUT THE
WORD "JEJUNE" IN THIS ARTICLE?

20:04.904 --> 20:06.706
YEAH, IT'S A GOOD WORD.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.841
YEAH, IF YOU'RE JE-JERK.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.845
IT WON'T HURT ANYBODY TO CRACK OPEN
A DICTIONARY AND LEARN SOMETHING.

20:12.879 --> 20:16.716
CRACK YOU OPEN AND ALL THAT COMES
OUT IS SMARM AND POMPOSITY.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.719
THOSE ARE BIG WORDS.
ARE YOU TIRED?

20:19.752 --> 20:21.721
DO YOU NEED TO LIE DOWN?

20:21.754 --> 20:24.891
SHUT UP. AND WHEN YOU'RE
DONE WITH THAT, SHUT UP!

20:24.924 --> 20:27.760
WHAT IS THIS I HEAR? DISHARMONY?

20:27.794 --> 20:30.196
ONE MINUTE YOU ARE
ALL LOVEY-DOVEY,

20:30.229 --> 20:32.365
AND THE NEXT YOU ARE AT
EACH OTHERS' THROATS.

20:32.399 --> 20:36.903
IT IS LIKE WATCHING... (
speaks Indian dialect )

20:36.936 --> 20:40.373
INDIA'S VERSION OF "THE VIEW."

20:40.407 --> 20:43.543
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO
ME THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.379
SOMEHOW I THOUGHT ROMAN
WAS NOT A REPULSIVE

20:46.413 --> 20:48.815
NARCISSISTIC PIG.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.618
AND I WAS DELUDED
BY HER HUMAN FORM.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.553
THEN SHE UNZIPPED HER FACE

20:53.586 --> 20:56.689
AND REVEALED HER
SELF-IMPORTANT LIZARD HEAD.

20:56.723 --> 21:00.793
AH, HOW IT GLADDENS MY HEART TO
SEE SUCH UNBRIDLED ANIMOSITY

21:00.827 --> 21:04.297
BETWEEN MY CO-EDITORS.
HA HA HA! YES!

21:04.331 --> 21:06.699
BOTH OF YOU MAY
REMAIN IN YOUR POSTS,

21:06.733 --> 21:09.802
SO LONG AS YOU MAINTAIN THIS
DELIGHTFUL LEVEL OF HOSTILITY.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.672
- IT WON'T BE A PROBLEM.
- NOT AT ALL.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.607
NOW LET'S SEE.

21:14.641 --> 21:17.444
WHICH "SEX AND THE
CITY" CHARACTER AM I?

21:17.477 --> 21:19.746
DO YOU HAVE TO SIT SO CLOSE?

21:19.779 --> 21:22.315
DO YOU HAVE TO EXIST?

21:27.887 --> 21:29.889
