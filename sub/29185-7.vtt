00:14.915 --> 00:19.019
* I worry when the sun is
shining brightly on my pillow *

00:19.053 --> 00:20.688
* I worry
when it starts to rain *

00:20.721 --> 00:22.790
* And I hear it tappin'
on the window *

00:22.823 --> 00:24.258
* I worry now my mother's gone

00:24.292 --> 00:26.294
* And the leaves are falling
from the willow *

00:26.327 --> 00:29.097

will keep spinning 'round *

00:29.963 --> 00:33.467

will keep spinning 'round *

00:33.501 --> 00:35.803
* I worry passing time

00:35.836 --> 00:37.838
* I don't know what
I should be feeling *

00:37.871 --> 00:39.640
* I worry that
I'll go through life *

00:39.673 --> 00:41.642
* Never truly finding meaning

00:41.675 --> 00:43.010
* I worry
that we don't rejoice *

* About the love
everybody's needing *

in my mind *

00:56.757 --> 01:00.194
* Didn't want to hang around me
any longer *

01:00.228 --> 01:02.563

there'll be no trace *

01:02.596 --> 01:04.098
* Of tears falling
from my face *

01:04.132 --> 01:07.301

a little stronger *

01:08.436 --> 01:11.539

really ain't no denying *

01:11.572 --> 01:13.341

You almost done?

01:31.625 --> 01:33.861
Oh, these aren't mine.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.996
Nothing in here
is mine.

01:36.029 --> 01:40.168
Nothing in here
is yours.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.470
It's all a forgery.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.805
Maybe you'll see
the real thing someday.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.049
[Tires screech]

01:56.083 --> 01:57.985
[Horn honks]

02:00.854 --> 02:03.857
Thank you for coming in early.
This won't take long.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.026
Yeah, Liz, we gotta talk to you
about something.

02:06.059 --> 02:09.297
Sure, but first I just want
to address one small thing.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.132
Now, listen, I'm pretty much
the last person

02:12.166 --> 02:13.934
to tell you
what's right and wrong.

02:13.967 --> 02:18.472
But there is an alarming amount
of food being stolen.

02:18.506 --> 02:23.244
Like, I get it, but there's got
to be some kind of moral limit.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.845
Does there?
Valid point.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.814
Again,
no judgment on my end.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.783
But as manager,
I feel obligated to point out

02:29.817 --> 02:31.652
that if we steal
all the food,

02:31.685 --> 02:34.154
we won't be able to stay open
as a restaurant.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.390
And more importantly,
we'll stop getting paid.

02:36.424 --> 02:37.958
We're already
not getting paid.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.693
I know.
We've talked about this.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.462
The "hospitality included"
thing,

02:41.495 --> 02:43.531
but that's really
Omni's master plan.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.700
We'll jack up the menu prices
and raise our hourly take-home.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.537
No, no, no.
We're not getting paid at all.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.872
-What?
-Our checks bounced.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.708
Everyone at the check-cashing
place was laughing at me.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.745
I was laughing, too,
'cause it was hilarious

02:57.778 --> 03:00.881
in a sick, twisted sort of way,
like a Goya painting.

03:00.914 --> 03:03.050
But still.

03:03.083 --> 03:06.720
Yeah, look, did your --
did your check bounce, Liz?

03:06.754 --> 03:08.289
No.
[Chuckles]

03:08.322 --> 03:12.025
Which makes me look like
an evil traitor, so yeah...

03:12.059 --> 03:15.729
let me get to the bottom
of this, okay?

03:15.763 --> 03:17.931
[Indistinct conversations]

03:17.965 --> 03:20.501
This is my third message,
Tarquin.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.169
Get your ass over here.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.439
[Cellphone thuds]

03:28.576 --> 03:31.144
Hey.
Hey.

03:31.178 --> 03:34.582
Sorry. I-I didn't mean
to get angry at you.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.451
Or accuse you
of selling us all out.

03:37.485 --> 03:40.220
No, I understand.
This is awful.

03:40.254 --> 03:42.556
It's pretty bad.

03:42.590 --> 03:46.627
Um, Gerson went out
to Redlands,

03:46.660 --> 03:50.398
get some work with
his cousin's catering company.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.533
What?
He never told me.

03:55.102 --> 03:57.271
Yeah.

03:57.305 --> 04:01.742
Hey, look, we -- we've been
through a lot together, Liz.

04:03.110 --> 04:07.648
We got the affair,
the drug freak-out at Orbis...

04:07.681 --> 04:09.517
You didn't really have snow
in your hair, did you?

04:09.550 --> 04:11.118
'Cause that really
would be impossible.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.853
Jeremy, um...

04:12.886 --> 04:13.887
What is it?

04:13.921 --> 04:17.124
Yeah, well,
it's kind of embarrassing.

04:19.460 --> 04:22.896
I'm broke, too, Liz.

04:22.930 --> 04:26.700
Sarah doesn't know it yet,
but we're maxed out.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.869
I was living
paycheck-to-paycheck

04:28.902 --> 04:31.572
when rats
took over Shamroxx.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.441
[Chuckles]
And now...

04:33.474 --> 04:36.209
I'm really trying,
Jeremy.

04:38.446 --> 04:43.951
I wake up every night
from 3:00 to 4:00

04:43.984 --> 04:45.986
worrying about the future.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.889
It sucks.

04:48.922 --> 04:51.992
That hour
lasts for six days.

04:53.594 --> 04:57.030
But you know what puts me
back to sleep?

04:57.064 --> 05:00.501
Half a Tylenol PM

05:00.534 --> 05:03.303
and imagining that
you're holding me, Liz.

05:05.005 --> 05:09.543
You're holding me
and Sarah and the baby.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.945
[Exhales sharply]

05:11.979 --> 05:17.851
Yeah, your -- your arms
are huge and strong.

05:17.885 --> 05:23.156
[Chuckles]
And they can keep us all safe.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.363
**

05:29.397 --> 05:32.366
[Chuckles]
Hey! There you are.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.301
I woke up early,
but you were already gone.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.003
I was wandering
all night.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.539
Oh.
Where'd you go?

05:38.572 --> 05:42.209
All the satellites up there
are mapping the wrong thing.

05:42.242 --> 05:43.210
Oh.

05:43.243 --> 05:45.946
Dud, I took
your shark tooth

05:45.979 --> 05:47.715
and made you an amulet.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.183
[Chuckles]

05:50.217 --> 05:53.587
Wow.
Blaise...thank you.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.556
You fought a monster.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.658
But it left something dark
inside you

05:57.691 --> 05:58.859
that clouded your vision.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.060
Yeah, yeah...

06:00.093 --> 06:02.630
Um...what do you mean?

06:02.663 --> 06:04.131
You were chasing gold.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.133
You thought money could
solve everyone's problems.

06:06.166 --> 06:09.603
Yeah, well, I mean, it would
really help [Laughing] you know,

06:09.637 --> 06:13.140
having a little,
but I'm sorry, I'm listening.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.108
No one can deny
what we've seen.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.778
Hidden rooms.
The testament of Jackie Loomis.

06:17.811 --> 06:21.982
Our spectacular emergence
from the philosophic egg.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.484
It's undeniable.
[Chuckles]

06:23.517 --> 06:26.487
You were lost.
But now you're not.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.088
Right. Yeah. I...

06:28.121 --> 06:30.858
Well, I'm -- I'm --
I'm still a little confused.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.393
'Cause what's our plan
exactly?

06:33.427 --> 06:35.262
Well, first we have to
get back in the lodge.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.030
I have some important materials
in there.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.066
Purifying agents.
Yeah, I don't know.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.535
'Cause Scott's really serious
about your banishment.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.704
He's got the whole place on,
like, lockdown.

06:43.737 --> 06:48.976
We have to accept the exile
our knowledge requires.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.680
And besides,
I'm pretty sure

06:52.713 --> 06:55.449
I know how to pick the lock
on the back door.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.585
Oh. Okay.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.890
These are nice.
Mm.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.425
But they might change the vibe
a little bit.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.994
Exactly.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.630
And the new vibe
is gonna be  fun.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.732
Good, normal fun.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.901
College football starts
this weekend.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.036
We're gonna have
all the games here.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.738
Have you been up
to the egg room?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.607
Uh, no.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.775
Ah, who cares?
It's just a waste of space.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.644
[Sighs]

07:23.677 --> 07:26.580
And I can't really fit in
the passageway that leads there.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.081
[Chuckles]

07:28.115 --> 07:30.450
Where is the money coming from
for all this?

07:30.484 --> 07:32.820
Oh, I'm paying
for everything myself.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.187
What?
I've got savings.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.423
I've always been
financially responsible.

07:36.456 --> 07:40.861
Well, congrats, Scott,
you're a better man than me.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.596
I don't get commissions
anymore,

07:42.630 --> 07:45.666
so I'm trying to sell the Caddy
just to cover rent.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.234
I'm sorry about that,
Ernie.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.169
But that's --
you know, that's --

07:49.202 --> 07:50.671
People have to
be responsible.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.372
I know!

07:52.405 --> 07:55.543
I'm just saying that we all
have our crap to deal with.

07:55.576 --> 07:58.779
No one's asking you to make
this kind of sacrifice.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.081
Well, this is
what leaders do.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.883
We sacrifice everything.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.051
[Laughs]

08:04.084 --> 08:06.486
Even if nobody
appreciates it.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.688
[Sighs]

08:07.721 --> 08:10.423
Okay, look, I haven't seen
Connie in a couple of days.

08:10.457 --> 08:13.794
And she hasn't said
a single word about my song.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.328
You been talking
to her?

08:15.362 --> 08:16.564
No.

with Anita.

Shh!
Ernie, call down, okay?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.335
We're not here
to murder anybody.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.970
Scott changed the locks.
It was our only way in.

Scott here?

Blaise, you have what you need?

-And you're not coming back --
-Ever.

09:42.616 --> 09:46.754
You're not coming back until
we can have some sort of --

I don't know -- reconciliation
meeting, which will be --

-Never.
-Wow.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.626
You're really not seeing it,
are you?

09:52.660 --> 09:53.927
Seeing what?

09:53.961 --> 09:56.396
That he is ruining this place
like none of it matters.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.899
Hey! You can't talk to me
like that, Dud.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.167
I'm Sovereign Protector.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.802
You know what?
You're banished, too.

10:01.835 --> 10:02.836
Good!

10:02.870 --> 10:04.104
Blaise: Let's go, Dud.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.472
Forget it.
They'll never understand.

10:05.505 --> 10:07.875
This isn't
the lodge anymore.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.110
Ernie, when I first
knocked on that door,

10:10.143 --> 10:11.478
this place
felt like magic.

10:11.511 --> 10:14.715
Magic? Blaise shot Scott
with a nail gun.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.150
He broke the back door
with an axe.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.451
And he ruined my song!

10:18.485 --> 10:21.154
Blaise doesn't
need magic.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.589
He needs...

10:22.622 --> 10:25.525
Man, when was the last time
you slept?

10:25.558 --> 10:27.327
I'll sleep
when I wake up.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.328
Scott: Oh, God...

10:28.361 --> 10:30.864
Blaise isn't the problem.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.467
You  are.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.071
You're under a spell,
Ernie.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.907
It's like my shark tooth.

10:39.940 --> 10:44.778
You've got poison inside you,
and you need to get it out.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.384
[Door opens, closes]

10:51.418 --> 10:58.325
I was pleased when Liz called
to offer me her gift.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.260
Gift?

11:00.293 --> 11:02.429
That is what
we call complaints.

11:02.462 --> 11:07.534
Because any opportunity to
maximize our potential is a...

11:07.567 --> 11:08.836
gift.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.772
Higher Steaks is rewriting
the transactional logic

11:11.805 --> 11:14.341
of the high-end
retail dining experience.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.243
And that is why I have
been authorized by Janet

11:16.276 --> 11:19.146
to deliver to you maybe...

11:19.179 --> 11:21.214
maybe...

11:21.248 --> 11:23.984
the most important news
of your life.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.854
Are you going to pay my staff
what you owe them?

11:26.887 --> 11:29.156
Plus something extra
to make up for the hassle?

11:29.189 --> 11:30.390
[All murmuring]

11:30.423 --> 11:31.124
Shh.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.692
[Murmuring stops]

11:35.863 --> 11:37.297
Even better, Liz.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.932
I do not have
your paychecks.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.267
[All groaning]

11:40.300 --> 11:43.636
Because paychecks
aren't necessary

11:43.670 --> 11:46.339
when you're all...

11:46.373 --> 11:47.941
shareholders!

11:47.975 --> 11:49.743
Okay, um...
[Clears throat]

11:49.777 --> 11:52.012
Could I have a word with you
for a moment, please?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.446
Yes, you may.
Go ahead.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.082
After you.
No, after you.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.117
No, after you.
No, no, you.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.854
They don't need stock
in a failing restaurant.

12:00.888 --> 12:01.955
You owe them money.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.356
I am but a vessel
for Janet.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.292
I do not have what
she does not put into me.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.393
So there's no money?

12:06.426 --> 12:07.660
The future's
far more valuable

12:07.694 --> 12:09.362
than whatever
small amount of cash

12:09.396 --> 12:11.164
might make you feel good
in the moment.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.632
-Think bigger, Liz.
-Tarquin.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.701
These people deserve to know
what's going to happen here.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.369
"These people"
are the  owners

12:16.403 --> 12:18.171
of Higher Steaks!

12:18.205 --> 12:19.339
As limited-participation,

12:19.372 --> 12:21.074
Class-C, non-voting
stockholders.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.010
When Higher Steaks succeeds,
so will they.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.211
But it never will.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.445
Because no one
who lives around here

12:25.478 --> 12:26.980
wants to pay $50
for a steak.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.481
Mm.
[Clicks tongue]

12:28.515 --> 12:31.952
Hey! If you can't handle this,
I'll go find Janet.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.620
Ha!
Nobody gets to Janet.

12:33.653 --> 12:37.090
Janet can't be found.
Janet is everywhere  and  nowhere.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.725
You tell Janet
I'm looking for her!

12:38.758 --> 12:42.262
And when I find her,
I'm gonna punch her in the face!

12:46.099 --> 12:47.367
[Exhales sharply]

12:47.400 --> 12:50.337
[Indistinct conversations]

12:50.370 --> 12:53.841

That was awesome, Liz.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.708
iNo pasarán!

12:55.742 --> 12:57.744
Higher Steaks
will be the graveyard

12:57.777 --> 13:00.280
for Omni Capital Partners
Food Service West.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.849
I'd die for you, Liz.

13:01.882 --> 13:05.718
Thanks. But you still
don't have paychecks.

13:05.752 --> 13:08.688
And I don't know when that's
going to happen.

13:10.657 --> 13:11.791
Banishment!

13:11.825 --> 13:14.094
If Scott thinks that's gonna
have any effect on me at all,

13:14.127 --> 13:15.195
he is sadly mistaken.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.030
I've been
banished before.

13:17.064 --> 13:19.399
You have?
This is all so clarifying.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.501
No one had seen a lynx in
Scotland since the 8th century.

13:21.534 --> 13:25.605
But Merrill saw one.
In the Year of Our Lord 1843.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.207
He was a kid,
playing in the snow.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.608
It's in the pamphlet.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.943
It's why he named the order
after the lynx.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.278
It's part of the legend.
Legend?

13:31.311 --> 13:33.080
Okay. If you're still
thinking that way.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.781
[Scoffs]

13:34.814 --> 13:36.149
Dreams, reality, memory.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.051
It's all one thing
to a kid.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.387
They have pure vision.
I have a theory.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.455
Anyone can get their hands
on the scrolls,

13:42.489 --> 13:45.325
but it takes someone truly
special to be able to read them.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.227
Merrill could,
and then he hid them,

13:47.260 --> 13:49.362
waiting for the next person,
someone worthy.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.797
Well, then it's got to be you,
Blaise.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.465
I mean, you've worked
so freakin' hard.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.968
I need to purify myself first.
Clear my vision.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.536
Right.
And in order to do that,

13:56.569 --> 13:58.738
I need to get my hands
on some lynx urine.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.640
Uhhh...okay.
Um...

14:00.673 --> 14:02.842
So where are you gonna
find lynx urine?

14:02.876 --> 14:03.944
I got a lady.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.145
You got
a lynx-urine lady?

14:05.178 --> 14:07.280
I also need to take
a long bath

14:07.314 --> 14:09.849
with my purifying salts
and unguents.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.451
Uh...

14:11.484 --> 14:14.187
Well, Larry's

Hi, Ernie.

Hey, Trish.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.609
I'm sorry.
I-I...

14:36.643 --> 14:38.778
I was gonna
knock on the door,

14:38.811 --> 14:42.849
but I just --
I didn't want to bug you.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.752
Oh. So you thought you would
just loiter around here

14:45.785 --> 14:46.686
for a few days?

14:46.719 --> 14:49.222
Creep out
the neighborhood?

14:49.256 --> 14:50.423
This may come as a shock,

14:50.457 --> 14:54.161
but you're not very discreet
in this.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.196
Where's the Caddy?

14:56.229 --> 14:58.798
It's dead.
I'm trying to sell it.

What's going on, Ernie?

15:06.073 --> 15:07.240
[Sighs]

15:08.908 --> 15:14.847
I was down in Mexico
for some stupid reason.

15:14.881 --> 15:20.387
I drank a little too much
tequila and, um...

15:20.420 --> 15:23.256
I had the dream again.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.591
That's all.

Oh, Ernie...

15:26.159 --> 15:28.528
It had been so long.

15:28.561 --> 15:32.365
I was usually able
to shake it.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.002
But not this time.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.604
[Chuckles]

15:37.637 --> 15:39.739
If things
had gone different...

15:39.772 --> 15:44.611
I keep thinking about that life,
with her

15:44.644 --> 15:49.016
[Sighs] all the things
that should've happened.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.651
[Chuckles]

by now.

what heaven is?

It's all the things
that  should've  happened.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.435
And we don't live in heaven.
We live here.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.438
And I'm glad.
You should be, too.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.875
You said you'd never
say her name again.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.881
I never have.

It's been
over 20 years.

Right now it feels
like yesterday.

16:29.556 --> 16:30.923
I can't.

dreams I had for her, for us,

21:57.750 --> 22:00.687
My parents...

22:00.720 --> 22:03.122
yelling at each other
all night.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.557
Oh.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.827
They didn't get along
with each other,

22:07.860 --> 22:09.396
and they didn't
get along with  me.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.698
The only time
they agreed on anything

22:11.731 --> 22:15.668
was when they kicked me
out of the house.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.437
Oh.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.805
Um...

22:18.838 --> 22:21.741
Blaise, that's terrible.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.643
Why?

22:23.676 --> 22:24.744
Why do you think?

22:24.777 --> 22:27.447
I was the shame
of the family.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.285
Where'd you go?

22:33.319 --> 22:36.456
I just sort of drifted
for a while.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.591

-Hey!

-It's been awhile.
-Yeah.

22:46.899 --> 22:49.969
Hey, Dorothy, thanks a lot
for the rush order.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.538
And, um,
I was just wondering

22:51.571 --> 22:53.640
if maybe you could
invoice me for this?

22:53.673 --> 22:55.041
'Cause cashwise,
I'm r--

22:55.074 --> 22:56.709
Say no more.
We'll work it out.

22:56.743 --> 22:59.912
I am not in this game
for the money.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.414
See ya.

To cover?

23:10.923 --> 23:12.825
No.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.195
$500 on the dog.

Pac-12 champion?

23:20.366 --> 23:22.835
Actually,
make it $5,000.

23:22.869 --> 23:25.572
Holy shit.

Uh, Blaise took a bubble bath
in my apartment yesterday.

23:42.622 --> 23:46.058
Oh. Wow.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.093
I'm sorry...

It's fine.

23:49.128 --> 23:50.663
How are you, Liz?

23:50.697 --> 23:53.766
Well, I just entered
a pawnshop, so...

23:53.800 --> 23:55.568
Right.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.870
Well, it was --
it was good to see you.

Hey. Ernie.

Um, I just want
to say thank you.

24:10.617 --> 24:11.484
For what?

24:11.518 --> 24:14.020
For watching out
for Dud.

Last year,

it was just a rough time.

24:39.546 --> 24:42.414
Hello, Burt.
It's a beautiful day out there.

24:42.448 --> 24:47.153
I thought I'd come in here
and inquire about a loan.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.556
This was my first night
on the news floor.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.390
I was 24.

24:51.423 --> 24:53.893
No one had time to train me.
They just threw me in.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.227
An editor
handed me proofs

24:55.261 --> 24:57.396
and told me to send them
down to the printer.

24:57.429 --> 24:58.931
He pointed
to a pneumatic tube.

24:58.965 --> 25:00.533
A-A pneumatic tube?

25:00.567 --> 25:03.102
The past is
a foreign country, Ross.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.672
That's where I come from,
unfortunately.

25:05.705 --> 25:08.507
So I roll up the proofs,
put them in the tube,

25:08.541 --> 25:11.210
push the button, and whoosh!
They're gone!

25:11.243 --> 25:14.847
But I didn't put them
in the cannister,

25:14.881 --> 25:18.017
so I broke the damn thing
and held up production,

25:18.050 --> 25:22.655
and every editor on the floor
spent the night screaming at me.

25:22.689 --> 25:25.892
But the next day
it was like it never happened

25:25.925 --> 25:29.161
because there was
another edition to get out,

25:29.195 --> 25:32.131
and I loved that so much,

25:32.164 --> 25:34.634
the turnaround.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.970
Can you really type
130 words a minute?

25:38.004 --> 25:40.339
I can do it blindfolded.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.208
Okay.
[Chuckles]

25:42.241 --> 25:45.912
Well, that's -- that's great,
but, um...

25:45.945 --> 25:49.381
also, Connie, I'm worried
you're gonna be overqualified

25:49.415 --> 25:51.851
for some of the stuff
I have coming in.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.119
I don't care.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.054
I'm starting over.

25:55.087 --> 25:58.825
Whaling used to employ
a lot of harpooners,

25:58.858 --> 26:03.495
but then the fisheries closed,
and the harpooners,

26:03.529 --> 26:07.366
I don't know...
they came to Temp Joy.

26:07.399 --> 26:11.638

get a little bored.

What you did, Liz,
taking out that loan --

27:04.957 --> 27:05.958
it was insane.

27:05.992 --> 27:07.126
Yeah.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.461
Greatly appreciated,
but insane.

27:09.495 --> 27:10.797

right?

27:10.830 --> 27:13.299
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah.

But it feels kind of good,
you know...

27:16.869 --> 27:18.237
I feel focused.

27:18.270 --> 27:21.007
Because now I have to find Janet
to get my money back

and utterly screwed.

God, I wish I could see the
world through your eyes, Liz.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.822
So are you gonna storm
the Omni castle?

27:35.855 --> 27:38.925
No. I wouldn't make it
past security.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.160
So I'm gonna
keep it simple.

27:41.193 --> 27:42.729
I'm gonna stake out Tarquin

wherever he goes.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.433
He'll lead me to Janet.

27:49.368 --> 27:51.938

You got to read the footnotes.

27:51.971 --> 27:53.439

27:53.472 --> 27:56.642
Yeah. Okay. So maybe we should
get some avocados and...

27:56.675 --> 27:58.177
"Civitas Solis."
Did you read that?

27:58.210 --> 27:59.879
Uh, yeah, maybe.
It was on the list?

27:59.912 --> 28:02.248
Campanella wrote it in prison
during the Inquisition.

28:02.281 --> 28:03.783
It's about a mythical city
to the West

on the inside.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.823
Merrill was obsessed
with "Civitas Solis."

28:10.857 --> 28:14.093
He said it was an actual place
if you had the right map.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.095
I think
he went looking for it.

28:16.128 --> 28:18.330
I think it brought him
to Long Beach.

28:18.364 --> 28:21.433
And he laid the foundation
for the new place.

right where we're standing.
