[Betty]
Previously onRiverdale...

00:02.698 --> 00:03.873
I'm Charles, your brother.

00:05.135 --> 00:07.268
Hey, your days
of exploiting kids

00:07.311 --> 00:09.313
to do your dirty work
ends tonight.

00:09.357 --> 00:11.837
Didn't we say
we were gonna turn this place
into a community center, Red?

00:11.881 --> 00:12.621
Jughead?

00:12.664 --> 00:13.883
Are you my roommate?

00:14.710 --> 00:16.103
So much for a new start.

00:16.886 --> 00:17.930
[doorbell rings]

00:24.372 --> 00:26.156
[tape playing]

00:28.245 --> 00:30.030
What... what is this?

00:31.553 --> 00:32.641
Fast-forward.

00:41.563 --> 00:43.565
It's literally six hours...

00:44.261 --> 00:45.436
of our house.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.701
Why would somebody do that?

00:49.745 --> 00:52.095
Film it, and then
leave the evidence
on the front doorstep?

00:52.139 --> 00:53.488
[Charles] To unsettle you.

00:53.531 --> 00:55.446
Let you know
you're being watched.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.535
Yeah, but why a videotape?

00:57.579 --> 00:59.407
Why something
so anachronistic?

00:59.450 --> 01:00.756
Maybe it's just a prank.

01:01.496 --> 01:02.584
[Jughead] If it was...

01:03.324 --> 01:04.673
it was an elaborate one.

01:05.413 --> 01:07.067
Over the next few days,

01:07.110 --> 01:08.459
then weeks,

01:08.503 --> 01:09.895
more and more
citizens of Riverdale

01:09.939 --> 01:12.550
received copies
of similar tapes,

01:13.203 --> 01:14.987
footage of their houses

01:15.031 --> 01:17.120
being watched
from across the street,

01:18.165 --> 01:19.079
for hours

01:20.428 --> 01:21.820
upon hours.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.824
No messages were included
with the videos,

01:26.869 --> 01:28.392
which somehow
made the whole thing

01:28.436 --> 01:29.959
even more disturbing,

01:31.874 --> 01:35.312
so that by Halloween,
the entire town was on edge.

01:35.356 --> 01:37.140
Who would get the next tape?

01:37.184 --> 01:38.359
What did they mean?

01:38.402 --> 01:39.577
Were they a warning?

01:40.187 --> 01:41.318
A test?

01:41.362 --> 01:42.537
[FP] Another one?

01:42.580 --> 01:43.712
Keep me updated.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.628
The Muggses also got a tape.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.238
Ooh! I'll get over there

01:48.282 --> 01:50.893
and get an interview with him
for tonight's broadcast.

01:50.936 --> 01:53.591
That's the fringe benefit
of living with the Sheriff.

01:53.635 --> 01:56.290
I get the inside scoop
before any other reporter.

01:56.333 --> 01:59.162
-Mmm-hmm?
-Mmm-hmm. [chuckling]

01:59.206 --> 02:01.512
Hey, Betty, is Jug still
coming home for Halloween?

02:01.556 --> 02:03.079
Yeah, that's the plan,
Mr. Jones.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.821
We're going to
hand out candy
and watch scary movies.

02:07.039 --> 02:08.084
Oh!

02:08.128 --> 02:09.172
Why don't you invite
your brother?

02:09.216 --> 02:10.782
Half-brother.

02:10.826 --> 02:12.784
Charles doesn't know
anybody in town.

02:12.828 --> 02:14.395
Okay, well, why is he
still in town?

02:14.438 --> 02:17.267
He's helping me with the tapes
and a couple of other cases.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.878
It's the one good thing
that came out
of this nightmare.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.271
Brought the entire
family together.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.404
Except for Jughead,

02:23.447 --> 02:25.710
who's at Stonewall Prep.

02:25.754 --> 02:28.365
And Polly,
who's in a facility
being de-programmed.

02:28.409 --> 02:30.498
-[door closes]
-[Toni] I think...

02:30.541 --> 02:31.890
it's time, Cheryl.

02:32.674 --> 02:34.371
Time? Time for what?

02:34.415 --> 02:35.677
To say goodbye to Jason.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.855
You've been promising me
for weeks.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.118
I know,

02:42.162 --> 02:43.293
and I'm going to.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.470
But I can't do it
before Halloween.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.255
It's our favorite holiday.

02:48.298 --> 02:51.127
Babe, then you're going to
say the same thing
about Thanksgiving

02:51.171 --> 02:53.216
And then Christmas.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.044
You're not going to
let this go, are you?

02:57.264 --> 03:00.005
Okay, fine.

03:00.049 --> 03:03.052
We'll rebury him
on the Blossom family plot
on the grounds of Thornhill.

03:04.358 --> 03:05.881
But I'm warning you...

03:05.924 --> 03:07.187
he's not going to like this.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.233
I'll get the shovels.

03:22.245 --> 03:23.681
Moose, why do you have this?

03:24.900 --> 03:27.946
Oh, just thinking maybe
I'm done with high school.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.079
I mean, I'm 18.

03:30.122 --> 03:32.037
The army doesn't care
who you are
or where you're from.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.865
Dude, what Bret did,

03:33.909 --> 03:35.302
spreading that article
about you,

03:35.345 --> 03:37.434
was a real scumbag move.

03:37.478 --> 03:38.696
But you can't let him win.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.176
He wants you to leave.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.004
[scoffs] Hell, he wants
both of us to leave.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.919
Let's not give him
that satisfaction, okay?

03:43.962 --> 03:45.529
It's easy for you to say, Jug.

03:45.573 --> 03:47.096
They're not calling you
"Gargoyle Boy."

03:51.753 --> 03:53.972
[indistinct chattering]

04:02.329 --> 04:03.852
[Gargoyle King growling]

04:08.596 --> 04:11.163
Hey! You and you,

04:11.207 --> 04:12.600
I made it very clear

04:12.643 --> 04:14.993
that there will be no costumes
on school property.

04:15.037 --> 04:17.082
Now take off the masks.
Come on.

04:17.126 --> 04:18.170
Hand it over.

04:18.214 --> 04:19.389
Class.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.564
[Veronica] Bee...

04:20.608 --> 04:21.652
you okay?

04:22.305 --> 04:23.393
Um, I'm not going to lie,

04:23.437 --> 04:25.352
I'm a little on edge
this Halloween.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.571
I mean, people are dressed up
like the Black Hood

04:27.615 --> 04:29.443
and the Gargoyle King...

04:29.486 --> 04:32.489
And there are
those damn videotapes.

04:32.533 --> 04:33.925
-[music playing]
-I'm with you, girl.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.579
Ever since my dad
broke into the Pembrooke,

04:35.623 --> 04:37.625
I've been looking
over my shoulder.

04:37.668 --> 04:39.279
And if the town's got
a voyeur now...

04:39.322 --> 04:40.280
[Reggie] What's up, guys?

04:41.933 --> 04:44.762
Who wants to TP
Mr. Honey's office
with me tomorrow night?

04:46.329 --> 04:48.331
Reggie, It's senior year.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.941
We're seniors.

04:49.985 --> 04:51.116
Exactly.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.814
It's senior year.

04:52.857 --> 04:54.511
This is our last Halloween
at Riverdale High.

04:54.555 --> 04:55.556
I'm in, Reggie.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.384
-Huh?
-What? Kev.

04:57.427 --> 04:58.428
Why?

04:58.472 --> 04:59.734
Honey gave me
a week's detention

04:59.777 --> 05:01.649
for going to the bathroom
without a hall pass.

05:01.692 --> 05:03.433
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Mmm-hmm.

05:03.477 --> 05:04.782
[Munroe] Yo, Red.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.610
I just got
some distressing news.

05:06.654 --> 05:08.612
You remember that crew
that was working
out of the arcade?

05:08.656 --> 05:10.135
Dodger and his boys?

05:10.179 --> 05:12.137
He's still pissed that
he got beat up and jumped by...

05:13.791 --> 05:15.445
that, uh, vigilante.

05:16.707 --> 05:17.969
[sighs]

05:18.013 --> 05:19.362
They're planning on wilding
Halloween night,

05:19.406 --> 05:21.059
looking to bust some heads.

05:21.103 --> 05:23.323
Damn it. The kids
in the neighborhood
will be sitting ducks.

05:23.366 --> 05:24.454
We got to do something.

05:24.498 --> 05:25.977
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

05:26.021 --> 05:28.328
Maybe keeping
the center open
later than usual.

05:28.371 --> 05:31.113
Why don't you guys host
a Halloween party
at the community center?

05:31.156 --> 05:33.550
That'll keep the kids
off the streets
and out of harm's way.

05:33.594 --> 05:34.986
And don't worry about costumes.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.162
One of my gal pals
in New York, Katy Keen,

05:37.206 --> 05:39.339
she goes to the High School
of the Performing Arts

05:39.382 --> 05:41.166
and is an amazing designer.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.646
Let me see what she can
whip up for you two.

05:42.690 --> 05:43.778
Yeah, sounds great.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.998
[Mr. Chipping sighs]
What about you, Jughead?

05:47.042 --> 05:49.436
Which of your
favorite horror writers

05:49.479 --> 05:50.785
did you bring in to share?

05:50.828 --> 05:54.179
I brought the collected works
of HP Lovecraft.

05:54.223 --> 05:55.746
[Bret scoffs]

05:55.790 --> 05:58.009
There is nothing scary
about Lovecraft.

05:58.053 --> 06:00.011
Says the guy
that brought in "The Raven"?

06:02.100 --> 06:04.842
My favorite Poe story
is "The Cask of Amontillado."

06:04.886 --> 06:06.278
That's the one where the guy is

06:06.322 --> 06:08.150
sealed behind a wall,
behind bricks,

06:08.193 --> 06:10.674
and then is never seen
or heard from again.

06:10.718 --> 06:13.329
And that would be
a horrible way to go,
don't you think, Forsythe?

06:13.677 --> 06:14.591
Just vanish.

06:15.592 --> 06:18.508
Like the Stonewall Four,
you mean?

06:18.552 --> 06:20.945
I'm betting Forsythe
could make it
the Stonewall Five.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.078
We're overdue for a vanishing.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.781
[Jughead] Who or what
are the Stonewall Four?

06:31.739 --> 06:33.610
Four students,

06:33.654 --> 06:35.220
all of whom
went to this school,

06:35.264 --> 06:37.135
all of whom [blows]

06:37.179 --> 06:39.007
disappeared without a trace.

06:39.660 --> 06:40.791
All at the same time?

06:41.270 --> 06:42.140
No.

06:43.446 --> 06:44.839
Uh, over 30 years or so.

06:44.882 --> 06:47.232
And they didn't
really go "missing."

06:47.276 --> 06:48.146
They dropped out.

06:50.018 --> 06:51.236
So what're you saying?

06:51.280 --> 06:53.630
Stonewall Four
is an urban legend, Jughead.

06:53.674 --> 06:56.024
It's campus lore, that's all.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.769
[Toni] I'm so proud
of you, babe.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.466
You're the strongest person
that I know.

07:03.510 --> 07:06.164
Well, it's not the first time
I've had to bury
my brother,

07:06.208 --> 07:08.863
but hopefully it's the last.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.995
Well, it was
the right thing to do.

07:13.389 --> 07:14.259
Cheryl, what's that?

07:18.307 --> 07:19.264
Oh, no.

07:20.483 --> 07:21.528
I was afraid of this.

07:21.571 --> 07:22.442
Of what?

07:23.225 --> 07:24.182
Jason's ghost.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.447
I think he's mad at us
for what you made me do.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.978
I know exactly
where this is going...

07:37.457 --> 07:38.327
the trash.

07:50.165 --> 07:51.993
What are you reading, Jones?

07:52.036 --> 07:54.474
Uh... The Stonewall Sentinel.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.345
Coffee?

07:56.867 --> 07:57.781
It's fresh brewed.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.174
Yeah, thanks.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.918
Searching for something
in particular?

08:04.571 --> 08:05.920
Like...

08:05.963 --> 08:09.489
articles about
the Stonewall Four, perhaps?

08:10.359 --> 08:11.360
How'd you guess?

08:11.403 --> 08:12.753
You love a good mystery,
don't you?

08:12.796 --> 08:14.406
I've already searched
through years of articles,

08:14.450 --> 08:17.453
and so far there's nothing
about disappearing students.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.108
My next stop is
the town newspaper office

08:20.717 --> 08:22.066
and the police station.

08:24.025 --> 08:25.156
Jones, are you okay?

08:27.071 --> 08:28.986
[groggily] Yeah, uh...

08:30.640 --> 08:31.511
I think I...

08:32.686 --> 08:33.991
I think I need some air.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.125
No.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.301
You need to lie down.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.698
[heart beating]

08:48.092 --> 08:50.399
Say hello to
the Stonewall Four for us.

09:01.628 --> 09:04.065
Okay, opening my eyes now.

09:04.108 --> 09:06.676
-[Veronica gasps]
-We look ridiculous.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.896
You look adorable,
both of you.

09:08.939 --> 09:10.375
What are our names again?

09:10.419 --> 09:11.594
According to Katy,

09:11.638 --> 09:13.378
you, Archie, are
Pureheart The Powerful,

09:13.422 --> 09:15.424
and you, Munroe,
are The Shield.

09:15.467 --> 09:16.730
Right on.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.035
Uh, Veronica, you need a ride
to the center?

09:18.079 --> 09:19.254
No, I'll take an Uber.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.299
I still have to do
some cleanup over here.

09:21.343 --> 09:23.432
But save a dance for me,
Pureheart, won't ya?

09:26.827 --> 09:27.697
[door closing]

09:28.655 --> 09:30.047
[TV playing]

09:32.833 --> 09:34.225
Why aren't you
in a costume?

09:36.924 --> 09:39.579
I am. I'm dressed
as Laurie Strode.

09:40.623 --> 09:41.450
Who?

09:42.669 --> 09:44.061
From the original Halloween...

09:44.496 --> 09:45.367
movie...

09:47.456 --> 09:48.544
[doorbell ringing]

09:49.676 --> 09:50.546
I got it.

09:57.074 --> 09:58.380
[children] Trick or treat!

10:04.865 --> 10:06.127
You guys look great.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.872
Have fun.

10:11.915 --> 10:12.612
-[child 1] Thank you.
-[child 2] Thank you.

10:12.916 --> 10:13.787
Yeah.

10:17.312 --> 10:18.356
[sighs]

10:18.400 --> 10:19.967
What time is Jughead
getting here?

10:20.010 --> 10:22.665
Uh, I don't know.
I keep texting him.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.625
Whatever. I'm going upstairs
to play Minecraft.

10:27.714 --> 10:28.671
Okay.

[dramatic music playing on TV]

10:34.808 --> 10:36.157
Happy Halloween to me.

-[Jughead] Ow!

10:43.164 --> 10:44.731
-Ow.

-Ouch.
-[clicking lighter]

10:50.780 --> 10:52.216
What?

11:04.533 --> 11:05.403
All right.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.019
All right!

11:12.062 --> 11:13.803
It's really funny.
Let me out now.

11:17.546 --> 11:18.373
Hey!

11:20.549 --> 11:21.811
All right, Bret.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.813
I know you love
Edgar Allen Poe.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.815
But trying to prove

11:25.859 --> 11:27.991
that the premature
burial is scary,

11:28.035 --> 11:31.299
the joke is on you
because I've already
survived way worse.

11:34.476 --> 11:35.695
[panting]

11:37.871 --> 11:38.741
Hey!

11:40.395 --> 11:42.702
All right, you sick
preppy bastard,
let me out.

Let me out!

Hello?

Jug? Is that you?

12:31.141 --> 12:32.621
[man] No, Betty, it's me.

12:35.493 --> 12:36.320
Who is this?

12:36.364 --> 12:37.757
You know who this is.

12:41.456 --> 12:42.674
[sighs]

12:42.718 --> 12:44.851
I don't know
what kind of sick joke

12:44.894 --> 12:46.113
you think you're playing,

12:46.156 --> 12:47.810
but the Black Hood is dead.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.290
And I'm calling the police.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.770
Have you checked on
the children lately?

[door opens]

13:04.827 --> 13:06.002
Oh...

13:06.046 --> 13:07.699
I'm sorry,
but we're closed.

You know,
I've been driving straight
the last 18 hours.

13:14.315 --> 13:15.925
I could really use
a cup of coffee

13:15.969 --> 13:17.318
and a home-cooked meal.

13:21.235 --> 13:22.540
I'll be quick.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.325

to my family by daybreak.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.155
Take a seat.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.547
I'll get you a menu.

Thank you.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.492
What the hell?
What are you doing with that?

14:01.536 --> 14:03.320
You know the rules,
you can't have
a knife in here.

14:03.364 --> 14:04.365
Hand it over.

14:04.408 --> 14:05.845
Can I get it back
before I go?

14:05.888 --> 14:06.976
Maybe.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.064
Red, we got trouble
at two o'clock.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.457
Dodger and his crew
just came in.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.328

14:16.290 --> 14:18.553
Hey,
this is a private event.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.512
Really?

14:21.556 --> 14:23.688
'Cause the sign outside says
it's open to the public.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.865
Not for you and
your crew, Dodger.

14:30.652 --> 14:31.653
Do I know you?

14:32.741 --> 14:34.351

[whistles]

14:37.833 --> 14:38.703
Eddie?

14:40.618 --> 14:42.490
You didn't tell me
you were taking
the night off.

14:42.533 --> 14:43.795
Who's handling
business out there

14:43.839 --> 14:46.102
while you're in here,
having a good time?

14:46.146 --> 14:47.712
Time is money.
Come on, let's go.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.366
He's not going
anywhere with you.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.455
Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do
about it, Captain Spandex?

14:51.499 --> 14:53.544
I heard you got your ass
kicked not too long ago.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.982
If you'd like a repeat,
I'll happily oblige.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.374
Now, leave.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.768
This is private property.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.075
Be seeing you boys.

15:07.428 --> 15:08.559
You too, Eddie!

15:09.212 --> 15:10.213
Keep moving.

15:10.257 --> 15:13.651
So, what do you think,
Ms. Isley?

15:13.695 --> 15:15.218
Are we ready
for any trick-or-treaters

15:15.262 --> 15:16.524
that might come our way?

15:16.567 --> 15:18.352
Oh, we're ready
for a lot of things

about now... Ms. Quinn.

And cue the toxic twins.

15:41.810 --> 15:44.204
They're being
fussier than usual.

15:44.247 --> 15:45.857
It must be
the blood moon tonight.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.076
Aren't they with Nana?

-[sighs]

15:59.871 --> 16:00.829
They're asleep.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.355
Nana, where's the other
baby monitor?

16:05.399 --> 16:07.096
I heard him crying.

16:08.489 --> 16:09.707
Your brother.

16:10.491 --> 16:11.883
In the chapel.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.983
[Toni] Okay,
that's not possible.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.027
I threw that doll away!

16:25.071 --> 16:25.985
I told you.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.422
It's Jay-Jay.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.554
He's angry. And now
he's haunting us.

16:32.252 --> 16:33.470
Cheryl, are you
messing with me?

16:33.514 --> 16:35.603
On the ashes of Thornhill,
I swear I'm not.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.348
But...

16:41.391 --> 16:42.566
I do think
we should have

16:42.610 --> 16:44.829
a Halloween seance
to try to talk to Jason.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.181
[Kevin] Cool. Can we
get outta here, now, Reggie?

16:48.224 --> 16:49.921
Relax, dude.

We're good.

I don't know who you are--

17:59.991 --> 18:02.472
[man] Yes, you do.
I'm your father.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.126
That's impossible.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.259
I saw you, him...

18:07.216 --> 18:08.522
I saw him die.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.001
You saw what
I wanted you to see.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.002
Stop lying.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.221
Tell me, Betty, do you know

18:12.265 --> 18:13.135
where this call
is coming from?

18:13.179 --> 18:14.441
Leave me alone!

It's coming
from inside the house.

18:37.464 --> 18:38.769
What the hell
are you doing here?

18:38.813 --> 18:40.075
I was just headed home,

18:40.119 --> 18:42.425
I thought you guys
might want some pizza...

18:42.469 --> 18:44.688
Wha...
Is everything okay?

18:47.300 --> 18:48.866
[breathing heavily]

19:21.203 --> 19:22.335
[Veronica] Here you go.

19:22.378 --> 19:23.466
Right off the grill.

19:23.510 --> 19:24.859
[trucker] I appreciate it.

19:24.902 --> 19:26.077
Hey, can I show you something?

19:27.688 --> 19:28.863
It's my family.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.735
My wife and
my two little girls.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.129
Aww...

19:35.217 --> 19:36.218
Aren't they angels?

19:36.262 --> 19:37.915
They are,
they're beautiful.

19:38.612 --> 19:40.091
And very lucky
to have a father

19:40.135 --> 19:41.223
who's willing
to drive through
the night for them.

19:42.572 --> 19:44.270
-I'm gonna get you a refill.
-Thank you.

19:45.445 --> 19:46.968
[Charles]
So, someone pretending

19:47.011 --> 19:48.839
to be the Black Hood
keeps prank-calling you?

19:50.363 --> 19:52.191
Mmm-hmm.
On and off, all night.

19:54.715 --> 19:55.933
You know, um...

19:57.021 --> 19:59.023
I could help you
trace the call.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.244
Really? You can do that?

20:02.288 --> 20:04.812
Yeah. Yeah.
I've got a unit
in the back of my trunk,

20:04.855 --> 20:06.727
and it would only take
a few minutes to set up.

20:07.728 --> 20:08.859
What do you think?

20:10.296 --> 20:12.036
Let's do it.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.777
I've been reviewing
your records, Kevin.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.344
You've had a rough year.
Well...

20:16.345 --> 20:17.303
rough couple of years.

20:18.521 --> 20:19.696
Mmm.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.657
You know, after everything
you've been through,

20:23.700 --> 20:25.267
I can only imagine how

20:26.399 --> 20:27.965
alone you must feel.

20:29.663 --> 20:30.751
Friendless.

20:33.101 --> 20:34.537
Sometimes, yeah.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.757
And it's that vulnerability
that Mr. Mantle exploited,

20:37.192 --> 20:38.062
isn't it?

20:40.978 --> 20:43.242
Ms. Burble tells me
your first choice

20:44.417 --> 20:45.766
for college is NYU.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.073
The theatre program.
It's a great school.

20:49.117 --> 20:50.423
It could be
a fresh start for you.

20:53.382 --> 20:54.514
Sadly, I doubt you'll get in.

20:54.557 --> 20:55.428
Excuse me?

20:56.298 --> 20:57.256
Hmm, well...

20:58.300 --> 20:59.649
Not after Carrie.

21:00.302 --> 21:01.390
Not after Heathers.

21:02.609 --> 21:03.784
And not after tonight.

21:07.004 --> 21:07.918
[sighs]

21:08.789 --> 21:10.573
It was...
It was Reggie's idea.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.096
To... to trash your office.

21:12.140 --> 21:14.490
I'm... I'm so sorry.

21:14.534 --> 21:15.926
Okay, Mr. Honey?

21:15.970 --> 21:17.276
No. It's very good, Kevin.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.321
Very good.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.627
That's all
I needed to hear.

21:20.670 --> 21:21.758
You can go now.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.114
[sighs]

21:30.158 --> 21:31.246
Talk to me, Eddie.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.552
What's Dodger
got you doing for him?

21:32.595 --> 21:35.163
Running? Collecting?
Stealing hubcaps?

21:35.206 --> 21:36.686
What do you care?

21:36.730 --> 21:38.122
I care because
I don't want you
getting in trouble.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.646
Or worse.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.256
Yo, Red, you're gonna
wanna check this out.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.171
-What?
-Some of the kids
wanted to go home.

21:43.214 --> 21:44.955
I went outside to make sure
everything was cool and...

21:44.999 --> 21:45.956
And?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.088
There's trouble out front.

21:47.131 --> 21:48.959
Hey, wait, can...
Can I bounce?

21:49.003 --> 21:50.787
Hell, no, you're staying here

21:50.831 --> 21:52.789
until the party's over,
and then I'm walking you home.

21:54.356 --> 21:55.836
[door closes]

21:57.403 --> 21:58.317
[Archie] Hey!

21:59.013 --> 22:00.319
I told you to get outta here.

22:01.102 --> 22:02.756
Nah, it doesn't
work that way.

22:02.799 --> 22:05.454
That crap gym of yours
might be private property,

22:05.498 --> 22:06.716
but this lot isn't.

22:07.108 --> 22:08.022
[spits]

22:09.023 --> 22:10.894
That's it, I'm done playing.

22:10.938 --> 22:12.287
Yeah, you do that, son!

22:13.027 --> 22:14.420
Come here and
get your ass shot.

22:17.074 --> 22:18.946
That would make
our Halloween. Right, boys?

22:25.518 --> 22:27.607
-[line ringing]
-Come on. Come on.

22:27.650 --> 22:29.260
[voicemail beeps]

22:29.304 --> 22:30.566
Mr. Jones, it's Archie.

22:30.610 --> 22:32.002
Can you do me a favor
and swing by the gym?

22:32.046 --> 22:33.656
We got a bunch of kids here
and some punks

22:33.700 --> 22:35.266
with guns out front.
Let me know.

22:36.877 --> 22:38.269
What do we do
in the meantime?

22:39.923 --> 22:42.099
We keep the party going,
as late as we have to.

22:43.318 --> 22:45.059
[Cheryl] I call upon
the invisible forces

22:45.102 --> 22:47.757
all around us to aide
and guide us through

22:47.801 --> 22:49.368
this communication
with the spirit world.

22:52.066 --> 22:54.373
Is the entity
inside this doll present?

23:07.821 --> 23:09.866
Okay, come on, Cheryl.
Stop moving it.

23:09.910 --> 23:12.129
I would, T.T.,
except, I'm not.

23:13.435 --> 23:14.262
I swear.

23:15.568 --> 23:17.874
Spirit, what is thy name?

23:24.620 --> 23:25.839
[gasps]

23:26.970 --> 23:28.755
I know you're upset

23:28.798 --> 23:31.497
that I made you bury
your dead brother's corpse,

23:31.540 --> 23:32.715
but this is so messed up.

23:32.759 --> 23:35.022
I already told you,
it's not me.

23:35.065 --> 23:37.633
It's Jay-Jay's ghost self
trying to engage with us.

23:37.677 --> 23:40.897
This is not Jason, Cheryl.

23:41.550 --> 23:42.899
He's not moving this board.

23:43.552 --> 23:45.119
Antoinette's right.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.078
It's not Jason...

23:49.819 --> 23:50.907
[whispers] it's Julian.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.041
What do you mean, Nana?

23:55.303 --> 23:56.391
Who is Julian?

23:56.435 --> 23:57.653
Your mother

23:57.697 --> 24:00.439
held three babies
in her womb.

24:01.527 --> 24:04.486
Julian was to be your triplet.

24:04.530 --> 24:08.011
But, in the end,
only you and Jason were born.

24:08.359 --> 24:09.926
Because,

24:09.970 --> 24:12.189
as the midwife explained it,

24:12.842 --> 24:14.496
you, Cheryl,

24:15.715 --> 24:18.457
had absorbed
the third one.

24:21.198 --> 24:22.199
Eaten it.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.901
That... that can't
possibly be true.

24:27.944 --> 24:30.381
Penelope was devastated.

24:31.121 --> 24:33.820
So she procured this doll

24:33.863 --> 24:37.301
and reared it alongside
the two of you

24:37.345 --> 24:40.217
until you were
no longer infants,

24:41.523 --> 24:44.483
at which point Julian...

24:45.266 --> 24:46.485
was retired...

24:47.964 --> 24:49.226
to the attic.

24:51.620 --> 24:52.621
So...

24:52.665 --> 24:54.754
now that the doll's back,

24:54.797 --> 24:56.582
the spirit of Julian

24:56.625 --> 24:58.105
is haunting Thistlehouse?

24:58.148 --> 25:00.716
What other explanation
could there possibly be?

25:00.760 --> 25:02.979
That you and Nana Rose

25:03.023 --> 25:04.372
are working together.

25:04.415 --> 25:06.722
And to what end
would Nana and I
be colluding?

25:06.766 --> 25:08.463
I don't know, babe,

25:08.507 --> 25:10.770
to make me realize
that things were better
when Jason was here?

25:10.813 --> 25:14.861
So we dig him back up
and park him
at the kitchen table.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.515
Back here in the chapel
would be acceptable.

25:21.563 --> 25:22.695
And if we...

25:23.391 --> 25:24.566
did

25:24.610 --> 25:26.002
bring Jason back home,

25:26.916 --> 25:29.179
would this haunting stop?

25:29.223 --> 25:31.181
Could we get rid of
this creepy-ass doll
once and for all

25:31.225 --> 25:32.618
and bury him
in Jason's grave?

25:34.010 --> 25:35.925
Yes, T.T.,
I agree to your terms.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.017
You know,

25:41.061 --> 25:43.542
this persona that you've...

25:44.107 --> 25:45.761
cultivated, Mr. Mantle,

25:45.805 --> 25:47.546
this prankster,

25:48.547 --> 25:49.809
this class clown,

25:49.852 --> 25:51.332
has made it impossible

25:51.375 --> 25:53.464
for your peers
and your teachers

25:53.508 --> 25:54.553
to take you seriously.

25:59.906 --> 26:01.342
Do you think
this has anything to do

26:01.385 --> 26:03.083
with your father abusing you?

26:03.866 --> 26:04.737
What?

26:06.042 --> 26:08.044
People won't notice
the bruises or the pain

26:08.088 --> 26:10.438
if they're laughing
at one of your jokes.

26:10.481 --> 26:11.352
Is that the thinking?

26:13.746 --> 26:15.965
Because the thing is...

26:16.009 --> 26:18.577
they're not laughing
with you, Mr. Mantle,

26:19.708 --> 26:21.101
they're laughing at you.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.714
Now, you consider that

26:25.758 --> 26:27.455
as you clean up my office,

26:27.498 --> 26:30.676
and you leave it exactly
as you found it.

26:35.376 --> 26:36.812
[Charles] We haven't
talked much since

26:36.856 --> 26:38.379
everything went down
with the Farm.

26:40.337 --> 26:41.295
Haven't we?

26:42.992 --> 26:45.168
You have every right
to be wary of me.

26:47.388 --> 26:49.346
Starting with the fact
that you let Mom walk

26:49.390 --> 26:51.522
right into the
lion's den with Edgar.

26:51.566 --> 26:52.828
Let the record show

26:52.872 --> 26:54.438
that when I reconnected
with Alice,

26:54.482 --> 26:56.092
and she found out
I worked with the FBI,

26:56.136 --> 26:57.572
she wanted to go undercover.

26:58.442 --> 26:59.705
To help Polly,

26:59.748 --> 27:00.749
to get a story.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.490
What about you?

27:04.623 --> 27:05.624
What do you want?

27:11.586 --> 27:12.848
I guess I've, uh...

27:14.545 --> 27:17.026
I've always wanted
to be part of a real family.

27:19.899 --> 27:22.379
But I know that
that takes time.

27:23.511 --> 27:24.991
[telephone ringing]

27:25.034 --> 27:26.296
[clears throat] Um...

27:26.949 --> 27:28.603
Just, um,
keep him talking.

27:29.038 --> 27:30.126
Okay.

27:34.043 --> 27:34.957
Hello?

27:35.001 --> 27:36.524
[man] Hello again, Betty.

27:37.656 --> 27:38.526
[Betty] Who is this?

27:38.569 --> 27:40.093
Don't play dumb.

27:40.571 --> 27:41.485
Sorry.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.141
I just have been getting
a lot of prank calls

27:45.185 --> 27:46.795
tonight pretending to be...

27:48.014 --> 27:49.842
you.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.800
I mean, it is Halloween,
and I do live
in the murder house. Right?

27:51.844 --> 27:53.149
You're testing my patience.

27:53.193 --> 27:55.674
You remember Halloween,
don't you?

27:57.066 --> 27:58.589
We used to go
trick-or-treating...

27:59.590 --> 28:00.504
as a family.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.550
You, me, Mom, Polly.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.727
We'd walk up and down
Elm Street.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.598
I remember.

28:07.642 --> 28:10.776
And when we got home,
we would go through
our bags of treats.

28:10.819 --> 28:12.429
You didn't want us
to eat apples

28:12.473 --> 28:14.431
because you thought
there might be
razor blades in them.

28:15.737 --> 28:16.956
Which is...

28:16.999 --> 28:20.220
pretty funny,
all things considered, huh?

28:20.263 --> 28:23.179
-[sternly] Elizabeth.
-Bye, you sicko.

28:25.878 --> 28:27.227
Did you trace it?
The number?

28:31.753 --> 28:32.580
Charles?

28:33.799 --> 28:34.713
What is it?

28:36.410 --> 28:37.716
Where is the call coming from?

28:39.848 --> 28:40.849
Um...

28:42.416 --> 28:43.678
It's...

28:43.722 --> 28:46.507
coming from Shady Grove
Treatment Center,

28:47.421 --> 28:48.770
where your sister's
been staying.

28:51.033 --> 28:53.775
Polly has been
prank-calling me?

28:55.124 --> 28:56.430
Well,

28:56.473 --> 28:58.301
I'll call the main line
at Shady Grove and see

28:58.345 --> 29:00.564
-how she got access to a phone.
-No, no, no. Wait.

29:03.132 --> 29:05.526
I have a better idea.

29:05.569 --> 29:07.963
[woman on phone]
Shady Grove,
how may I assist you?

29:08.007 --> 29:09.225
Hi, I was wondering
if I could speak

29:09.269 --> 29:10.574
to one of your
patients, please.

29:10.618 --> 29:11.750
Name of patient?

29:11.793 --> 29:12.751
Polly Cooper.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.361
Who may I ask is calling?

29:15.797 --> 29:16.885
Edgar.

29:16.929 --> 29:18.278
One moment, please.

29:22.282 --> 29:24.023
[Polly] Edgar?
Is it really you?

29:24.066 --> 29:25.938
No, bitch, it's your sister.

29:25.981 --> 29:26.895
What?

29:26.939 --> 29:29.071
Edgar is worm food,

29:29.115 --> 29:31.334
and you're as good as
dead to me now, too.

29:31.378 --> 29:33.946
What? Betty, how could you
pretend to be Edgar?

29:33.989 --> 29:35.991
How could you
pretend to be Dad?

29:36.035 --> 29:38.689
-I... I...
-You are sick, Polly.

29:38.733 --> 29:39.647
Really truly.

29:39.690 --> 29:40.822
[call disconnects]

29:41.954 --> 29:42.824
[slams receiver]

29:47.220 --> 29:49.570
So ends the Case
of the Mystery Prank Caller.

29:49.613 --> 29:51.267
You know, I wish
that I could say

29:51.311 --> 29:53.617
tonight's been
particularly insane
because it's Halloween,

29:53.661 --> 29:56.490
but no, this is actually
fairly typical.

29:58.579 --> 30:01.582
[spooky music playing on TV]

30:01.625 --> 30:03.453
I'm not usually
on kitchen duty,

30:03.497 --> 30:04.803
so I hope
the burger was all right.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.369
Oh, delicious.

30:06.413 --> 30:08.023
Nothing like
a home-cooked meal.

30:08.067 --> 30:10.417
[chuckles]
We here at Pop's try.

30:10.460 --> 30:13.376
Any room for dessert?
We have pumpkin pie,
homemade.

30:14.508 --> 30:16.815
Oh, well, well,
I will take a slice of that.

30:16.858 --> 30:17.946
-All right.
-Thank you.

30:24.953 --> 30:26.520
[TV beeps]

30:26.563 --> 30:27.782
[Alice on TV] We have just
received breaking news.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.653
An extremely
dangerous patient

30:29.697 --> 30:32.743
escaped Shady Grove
Treatment Center
earlier today.

30:32.787 --> 30:35.659
A serial killer nicknamed
"The Family Man,"

30:35.703 --> 30:37.139
Michael Matthews,

30:37.183 --> 30:39.533
forced his many victims
to cook him meals

30:39.576 --> 30:41.578
before brutally murdering them.

30:41.622 --> 30:44.320
He is of average height
and medium build.

30:44.364 --> 30:46.322
After escaping
from Shady Grove,

30:46.366 --> 30:47.671
he killed a trucker

30:47.715 --> 30:50.022
and stole his clothes
and vehicle.

31:22.837 --> 31:25.318
[pounding on door]

31:27.929 --> 31:28.930
[glass breaking]

-Check the bay doors next.

32:31.123 --> 32:32.472
Mr. Jones?

32:32.515 --> 32:34.213
Hey, Red, sorry
it's taken me a minute.

32:34.256 --> 32:35.910
It's been a crazy night,
but I'm pulling up right now.

32:35.954 --> 32:36.824
Okay, great.

32:42.961 --> 32:43.962
Where's Eddie?

32:45.572 --> 32:46.834
I'll check around back.

[gunfire]

Hey!

-Eddie?
-[Eddie whimpering]

-Eddie?

Right now!

[indistinct talking
over police radio]

33:02.154 --> 33:03.198
[breathing heavily]

33:03.242 --> 33:04.112
You're okay, you're okay.

33:06.245 --> 33:07.898
[Charles] Hey,
I've been thinking, um,

33:07.942 --> 33:10.075
given how well
you handled yourself

33:10.118 --> 33:11.772
with the Farm, at the motel,

33:11.815 --> 33:13.339
I think you'd make
an excellent candidate

33:13.382 --> 33:14.993
for the Junior
FBI Training Program.

33:16.733 --> 33:18.997
An FBI program
for high schoolers?

33:20.520 --> 33:22.304
Is that actually a thing?

33:22.348 --> 33:23.740
-It is.
-Hmm.

33:25.046 --> 33:26.482
We could work together
trying to figure out

33:26.526 --> 33:27.875
who's sending
these videotapes.

33:28.963 --> 33:31.531
You know this town
a whole lot better than I do.

33:33.054 --> 33:34.012
That's true.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.016
Will you consider it, at least?

33:51.638 --> 33:53.466
[Mr. Honey]
Looks good, Mr. Mantle.

33:55.555 --> 33:57.165
So, can I go home?

33:57.209 --> 33:58.558
I mean, it's already morning.

34:00.908 --> 34:02.692
As long as we
understand each other,

34:03.650 --> 34:04.912
we can walk
out of here together.

34:12.920 --> 34:13.790
What the hell?

34:14.226 --> 34:16.489
Bella! Bella!

34:16.532 --> 34:19.405
[dramatic gasp]
What happened to my car?

34:19.448 --> 34:23.061
It's such a shame
when someone disrespects
your property, isn't it?

34:23.104 --> 34:24.062
[clicks tongue]

34:25.541 --> 34:27.369
Wonder who did this.

34:27.413 --> 34:29.067
Probably hooligans
having some...

34:30.111 --> 34:31.112
Halloween fun.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.464
Would you like a ride,
Mr. Mantle?

34:36.074 --> 34:36.944
No.

34:37.379 --> 34:38.467
No, thank you.

34:39.773 --> 34:40.687
Well...

34:42.167 --> 34:43.168
get home safe.

34:49.261 --> 34:51.089
You're home now, Jay-Jay.

34:52.786 --> 34:53.700
For good.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.096
All is right in the world.

34:59.575 --> 35:01.838
Isn't it, my love?

35:03.188 --> 35:04.580
Yep.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.167
[gasping]

36:09.210 --> 36:11.647
Where... Where...

36:11.691 --> 36:13.345
I'm always amazed
at my students' antics.

36:13.388 --> 36:15.390
How they get extra...

36:15.434 --> 36:17.044
creative at Halloween.

36:17.436 --> 36:18.654
Creative?

36:19.481 --> 36:21.179
Don't take it
personally, Jughead.

36:22.049 --> 36:23.485
It's a...

36:23.529 --> 36:25.183
Stonewall Prep tradition.

36:25.792 --> 36:27.576
It means you belong now.

36:30.057 --> 36:31.145
Belong to what?

36:32.015 --> 36:32.973
To us, of course.

36:33.713 --> 36:35.105
Here is your phone.

36:35.149 --> 36:37.934
You've got a lot of
missed texts and calls.

36:39.545 --> 36:40.676
Did you know about this?

36:42.330 --> 36:43.679
Absolutely not.

36:46.334 --> 36:47.640
What was even
the point of this?

36:47.683 --> 36:49.598
It was just a bit of
Halloween fun, that's all.

36:50.469 --> 36:51.731
What? Did we go too far?

36:54.734 --> 36:57.040
In that case,
you could always...

36:57.084 --> 36:58.128
just leave.

37:00.827 --> 37:01.958
No.

37:03.003 --> 37:04.004
I'm good.

37:06.746 --> 37:07.921
Happy Halloween, kids.

37:10.489 --> 37:11.881
[Archie]
How you feelin', Eddie?

37:11.925 --> 37:13.231
Like I got shot in the leg.

37:15.755 --> 37:17.365
Doctor said it was just
a flesh wound.

37:18.497 --> 37:20.020
You got really lucky.

37:20.063 --> 37:22.022
Eddie, it could've been
a lot worse.

37:22.065 --> 37:24.242
If Dodger and
his crew did this,

37:24.285 --> 37:25.286
we can help you.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.070
Me, Munroe, Sheriff Jones.

37:27.114 --> 37:27.941
Help how?

37:29.595 --> 37:30.770
[softly] The last thing I need

37:30.813 --> 37:32.946
is for these guys
to think that I snitched,

37:34.121 --> 37:35.949
especially since
you took away
my switchblade.

37:35.992 --> 37:38.952
That's not
gonna protect you
from guys like Dodger,

37:39.605 --> 37:40.910
but Munroe and I will.

37:40.954 --> 37:42.260
Come hang with us
at the center.

37:42.303 --> 37:43.913
They won't step foot
in there ever again.

37:43.957 --> 37:46.307
And then what happens
when the center
closes at 10:00?

37:46.351 --> 37:48.091
Where do I go then?

37:48.135 --> 37:50.659
I'm back out on the street
'cause I have to be.

37:51.312 --> 37:52.313
A lot of us are.

37:52.966 --> 37:54.272
I have two options...

37:55.751 --> 37:57.405
either I roll with Dodger

37:59.277 --> 38:00.278
or hide

38:00.669 --> 38:01.888
from Dodger.

38:02.541 --> 38:03.759
That's it.

38:09.896 --> 38:12.507
I can't believe
you held that guy off
on your own.

38:12.551 --> 38:13.726
I mean, I can.

38:14.727 --> 38:16.250
You know you're
a total badass, right?

38:16.990 --> 38:19.819
[chuckles] I like to think so.

38:21.821 --> 38:23.431
And how did
Pureheart hold up?

38:24.476 --> 38:26.173
[Archie sighs]

38:27.696 --> 38:28.915
Honestly...

38:30.960 --> 38:32.222
I don't know
what I'm doing.

38:33.833 --> 38:37.532
I vowed to create
a safe space
for the kids in this town,

38:37.576 --> 38:39.055
something my dad
could be proud of.

38:40.361 --> 38:41.797
It's never going to happen

38:41.841 --> 38:43.103
as long as guys like Dodger
are out on the streets.

38:43.146 --> 38:45.061
Okay, so then
we clean up the streets.

38:57.509 --> 38:59.162
Archie...

38:59.206 --> 39:01.164
As well as you fill them out,
you're not actually considering

39:01.208 --> 39:03.341
fighting crime
in those tights, are you?

39:03.384 --> 39:05.038
Of course not.

39:06.561 --> 39:08.171
I'm going to need a mask.

39:08.215 --> 39:09.216
[Toni] Cheryl?

39:09.869 --> 39:11.218
How was your shower, my love?

39:12.524 --> 39:13.873
Why was this
sitting on the bed?

39:15.178 --> 39:17.180
I thought we agreed
to put an end to this.

39:17.224 --> 39:18.225
Jason's back.

39:18.268 --> 39:19.269
You got what you wanted.

39:21.881 --> 39:25.101
Although it pains me
to admit it...

39:26.799 --> 39:29.584
Yes, I was
gaslighting you before.

39:29.628 --> 39:32.021
And for that,
I apologize, but,

39:32.065 --> 39:34.415
I swear, on Jason's life,

39:34.459 --> 39:37.070
I have no idea
how that got back
into this house.

39:38.419 --> 39:39.768
Truly.

39:39.812 --> 39:42.118
Well, then,
how is this happening?

39:42.162 --> 39:43.816
I mean...

39:43.859 --> 39:46.296
We for sure
buried this doll. Right?

39:47.385 --> 39:48.516
[Nana] I told you...

39:49.778 --> 39:51.258
It's Julian.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.394
T.T.

39:58.221 --> 40:00.789
I'm afraid the true haunting
of Thistlehouse
has only just begun.

40:06.926 --> 40:09.276
Moose, you're not
going to believe what Bret--

40:14.760 --> 40:17.284
[Jughead] I mean, it's like
Moose completely vanished.

40:18.372 --> 40:21.070
There's not a trace of him
anywhere, Betty.

40:21.114 --> 40:23.464
Well, is it possible
he actually joined the Army?

40:23.508 --> 40:24.465
I don't know.

40:25.466 --> 40:26.467
I placed a couple calls,

40:27.250 --> 40:28.556
but...

40:28.600 --> 40:30.732
I know it was them
that chased him out of here.

40:30.776 --> 40:32.212
I mean, did they
lock me in that coffin

40:32.255 --> 40:33.866
because they wanted me
out of the way

40:33.909 --> 40:35.433
while they terrorized Moose
into leaving?

40:37.217 --> 40:38.174
[sighs]

40:39.959 --> 40:41.526
I don't know.

40:41.569 --> 40:43.484
I just hate that
they kept me
from helping you.

40:43.528 --> 40:45.355
I'm sorry that you had to
go through that alone.

40:46.313 --> 40:48.054
Well, technically,
I wasn't alone.

40:49.359 --> 40:50.317
I was with Charles.

40:51.100 --> 40:52.493
Oh.

40:52.537 --> 40:55.191
So are we warming up
to our half-brother now?

40:55.627 --> 40:57.063
I guess so.

40:58.630 --> 40:59.935
Yeah. Kind of.

40:59.979 --> 41:02.503
He wants me to join
the Junior FBI,

41:02.547 --> 41:04.026
which, I don't know.

41:04.070 --> 41:05.724
[laughs] I might
actually be good at.

41:05.767 --> 41:08.161
[Jughead] Yeah. I think
you would be great at it.

41:09.336 --> 41:11.207
I'm just glad that
Charles was there for you.

41:11.947 --> 41:13.079
[Betty] Yeah.

41:14.863 --> 41:16.474
He might be the real deal.

41:18.127 --> 41:19.346
Meanwhile, I feel guilty

41:19.389 --> 41:21.348
that I wasn't
there for you, Jug.

41:21.566 --> 41:22.784
No.

41:22.828 --> 41:25.091
Well, actually,
you were there for me.

41:25.134 --> 41:26.266
Thinking about you
was the only thing

41:26.309 --> 41:27.485
that kept me
from losing hope.

41:28.703 --> 41:29.878
And my sanity.

41:31.619 --> 41:33.403
I think deep down,
I know that
if I ever really went missing,

41:33.447 --> 41:35.014
that you would be the one
to find me.

41:35.623 --> 41:36.885
I would, Jug.

41:41.977 --> 41:43.152
I promise.
