00:08.925 --> 00:11.428

we had to do to pay for them?

Hunter never performs
at small venues.

I am going to die!

"I Want Crazy,"

09:26.565 --> 09:28.317
Good work
on these, though.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.153
You're a real artist.
- Thank you.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.281
- You're welcome. Leave!

09:33.364 --> 09:35.199
- SOPHIE: Oh, okay.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.828
- Pepper, don't worry.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.538
He wasn't back there anyway.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.582
- How do you know?
- Because he's right there!

09:43.666 --> 09:47.003
- Hey, Hunter, can I have
a quick word with you?

09:47.086 --> 09:48.629
- I'm so sorry.
I can't even talk.

09:48.713 --> 09:49.672
I think I cracked
my tooth.

09:49.755 --> 09:52.300
- But I just have a few--
- You heard the man.

09:52.383 --> 09:56.929
Now move along,
counterfeiter.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.015
- Pepper, what
about your dad?

09:59.098 --> 10:01.267
- Why would I want to
interview my dad?

10:01.350 --> 10:03.519
He's not a rockstar,
he's a den--

10:03.602 --> 10:06.856
My dad's a dentist!

10:06.939 --> 10:09.275
This is my dad's card.
He's a really good dentist.

10:09.358 --> 10:11.569
Please give it to Hunter.
- Yeah, I'll get right on it.

10:11.652 --> 10:12.695
- And tell him I love him!

10:12.778 --> 10:15.573
I love him! I love him!
I love him! I love him!

10:15.656 --> 10:19.452
I love him! I love him!

Hey, guys.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.299
- Oh, how was your Nana's
birthday party?

10:33.382 --> 10:36.135
- Oh, um, yeah, it was...
it was great, a great time.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.637
- Oh, sounds fun.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.432
- Yep, just a normal party.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.308
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.810
Was it anything like, uh...

10:44.894 --> 10:46.645
this!

10:50.983 --> 10:53.110
Boom! Just blew you up.
[laughs]

10:59.742 --> 11:02.912
- You ditched the team
to go to a concert?

11:02.995 --> 11:03.954
- How did you get this?

11:04.038 --> 11:06.290
- Yesterday, when I was
cleaning the stench

11:06.374 --> 11:09.168
of Port-a-Potty
off of my soul,

11:09.251 --> 11:11.420
my stepmom Brenda texted
me from the concert.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.548
She was there, too,
of course.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.301
- Whoa, guys, I...
I can explain.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.428
- Save it, Bella.
You lied to us.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.263
- Yep, and we're
telling Coach.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.099
Let's go.
- What?

11:23.182 --> 11:23.933
Okay, please, you can't.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.684
- And if you think
Coach'll be mad,

11:25.768 --> 11:30.689
wait till Nana hears you
skipped her birthday party.

11:30.773 --> 11:31.941
- Sawyer, just...

11:32.024 --> 11:34.360
no.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.320
- He spent seven hours
in the hot sun

11:36.404 --> 11:38.155
cleaning bird poop while
you were on stage

11:38.239 --> 11:41.617
shaking your rump
to the funk!

11:41.700 --> 11:43.285
- Come on, guys,
you don't understand.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.413
It was Hunter Hayes!

11:45.496 --> 11:49.875
- Oh, Hunter Hayes!
It was Hunter Hayes!

11:49.959 --> 11:52.253
That changes...nothing.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.213
- Do you know what
Coach is gonna do

11:54.296 --> 11:55.339
when he finds out
you lied to him?

11:55.423 --> 11:58.384
He's gonna bench you.

11:58.467 --> 12:00.636
- Come on, guys, all I did
was miss one silly clean-up.

12:00.719 --> 12:02.304
- But you should
have been there, Bella.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.473
It was a team event.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.684
- A filthy, vile team event--

12:06.767 --> 12:08.686
which I will be discussing
with my therapist

12:08.769 --> 12:11.313
well into my forties.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.107
- Have fun on the bench.

12:13.190 --> 12:15.317
- Guys, I am so sorry
I missed the clean-up,

12:15.401 --> 12:17.945
but please don't
tell Coach.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.113
I'll...I'll do anything.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.739
- Oh.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.909
How about you do my biology
homework for me?

12:23.993 --> 12:25.411
- Done!

12:25.494 --> 12:27.413
- Clean out my ferret's cage.
- On it!

12:27.496 --> 12:28.622
- And I need three dozen
cupcakes by tomorrow.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.583
Make sure they're gluten-free,
sugar-free, dairy-free,

12:30.666 --> 12:35.087
and also rich, creamy,
and totally delicious.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.006
- I'm not sure
that's even possible.

12:37.089 --> 12:41.093
But don't worry, I'm going to
totally make it up to you.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.928
- TROY: Unh-unh-unh,
not so fast.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.638
We are just getting started.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.682
- You're gonna wanna
write these down.

12:46.765 --> 12:47.975
Grab a pen, rump shaker.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.608
- Hey, Silverstein,
how's that interview comin'?

12:55.691 --> 12:58.527
Remember, you promised
me a big name.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.738
- Don't worry, Ace.
I'm on it.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.866
- Good. I'd hate to have to
cancel you after one episode.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.618
But I will.

13:08.787 --> 13:10.539
- Pepper, it's time
to face the facts--

13:10.623 --> 13:12.625
you're not going
to get Hunter Hayes.

13:12.708 --> 13:13.834
- I know.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.544
But where am I gonna find
a cool musician at this point?

13:15.628 --> 13:18.422
- Oh, here.
- Hey, girls.

13:18.506 --> 13:21.884
- What? At least
he's a musician.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.970
- Hey, Kenny, can I interview
you for Bulldog Network?

13:25.054 --> 13:27.556
- Okay.
- Roll camera.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.309
We're here with Kenny Ping,
musician and first chair oboe.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.561
Kenny, do you like nachos?

13:32.645 --> 13:33.687
- Well, my mom doesn't
let me eat cheese

13:33.771 --> 13:39.276
because it enflames
my embouchure.

13:39.360 --> 13:43.572
- Cut! Thanks, Kenny.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.740
[sighing]
That was a disaster.

13:44.823 --> 13:47.743
Ace is going to cancel me
before I even air.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.286
- Wait, look at this!

13:49.370 --> 13:50.788
Hunter just posted
a Click Pic

13:50.871 --> 13:52.706
of the poster from
your dad's dental office!

13:52.790 --> 13:54.667
- He must have seen
the business card.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.919
If we leave now, I can
still get my interview.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.672
- BOTH: [squealing]

14:00.839 --> 14:02.883
- Hey, guys. Sawyer,
here's your homework.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.593
I even did the extra credit.
- Thanks a lot.

14:04.677 --> 14:08.514
Now they'll know
I didn't do it.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.558
- Troy, the cage is clean.

14:10.641 --> 14:13.269
I wish you had told me

14:13.352 --> 14:16.146
your ferret had
a taste for human flesh.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.982
- You actually did that?

14:18.065 --> 14:18.899
Girl, that ferret crazy!

14:23.237 --> 14:26.532
- And here, Newt,
I baked your cupcakes.

14:26.615 --> 14:29.201
It was hard without
the dairy, and the gluten,

14:29.285 --> 14:30.869
and the sugar.

14:30.953 --> 14:35.207
And it took me three tries,
but I finally did it.

14:35.291 --> 14:39.545
- Ugh, not quite there yet.

14:39.628 --> 14:40.879
- You know, Bella,
you look tired.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.674
Why don't you sit down?
- Thank you.

14:43.757 --> 14:47.219
- And clean the mud
outta my cleats.

14:47.303 --> 14:50.347
- Ooh, good idea.
Mine, too.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.391
- But I already did
everything on your list.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.393
So should that not
make us even

14:54.476 --> 14:56.228
for me skipping the clean-up?

14:56.312 --> 14:57.688
- Hm...
- Oh...

14:57.771 --> 14:59.648
- That's a...that's
a good question.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.650
I don't know.
Let's ask Coach.

15:01.734 --> 15:02.860
See what he thinks.
Oh, Coach?

15:02.943 --> 15:05.321
- Fine! I'll clean
your stupid cleats!

15:05.404 --> 15:08.365
- Ooh, mine, too.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.658
- Uh, no offense, Newt,

15:09.742 --> 15:13.829
but how did your cleats get
muddy from sitting on the bench?

15:13.912 --> 15:15.414
- Oh, that's not mud.

15:15.497 --> 15:19.710
I just stomped all over those
lousy cupcakes you made.

15:19.793 --> 15:23.005
Sorry. Power's not
a good color on me.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.429
- Okay, that laughing gas

15:30.512 --> 15:32.681
should have you
nice and relaxed.

15:32.765 --> 15:33.766
Let me just test it out.
- All right.

15:33.849 --> 15:36.435
- Knock-knock.
- Who's there?

15:36.518 --> 15:38.520
- Interrupting dentist.
- Interrupting dentist...?

15:38.604 --> 15:40.481
- [equipment whirring]

15:40.564 --> 15:44.985
- See? Oh, 'cause...oh...

15:45.069 --> 15:50.032
Looks like the laughing
gas is not working.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.576
Let's just give it
a little more time to set in.

16:01.251 --> 16:02.753
- All we have to do
is interview him

16:02.836 --> 16:03.796
without him knowing
he's being interviewed.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.465
So, keep it together
this time.

16:06.548 --> 16:11.637
- Don't worry. It's
all outta my system.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.556
- Hi, I'm your dental hygienist.
My name is Coco and she is...

16:14.640 --> 16:17.309
- [giddy laughter]
Hi...

16:17.393 --> 16:20.187
- Heidi.

16:20.270 --> 16:23.857
- Aren't you a little young
to be a dental hygienist?

16:23.941 --> 16:24.692
- [laughing]

16:24.775 --> 16:27.986
Oh, you. I get that a lot.

16:28.070 --> 16:31.198
I'm 31.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.324
- Okay.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.285
- Well, I guess we should
start off by flossing you.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.579
- I'll do it!

16:37.663 --> 16:40.249
All right, here it comes.

16:40.332 --> 16:43.210
Open wide!

16:43.293 --> 16:44.878
OMG!
- What are you doing?

16:44.962 --> 16:47.715
- Uh, perhaps you'd
better skip the floss

16:47.798 --> 16:50.050
and get right into
the questions.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.719
- Questions?

16:51.802 --> 16:53.679
- Yes, my associate will
be recording your answers

16:53.762 --> 16:56.765
to ensure quality service--
a totally normal procedure.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.852
How many times
a day do you brush?

16:59.935 --> 17:01.603
- Twice.
- Um-hm.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.689
Okay, okay, great,
uh, after your break-up,

17:03.772 --> 17:05.357
how did you keep
a smile on your face

17:05.441 --> 17:08.193
when the cold fingers of despair
were clutching at your heart?

17:08.277 --> 17:09.403
- What's going on here?

17:09.486 --> 17:11.905
You're...you're not really
a dental hygienist, are you?

17:11.989 --> 17:16.117
- No, I'm not.
Either is she.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.871
- I love you! I love you!
I love you! I love you!

17:18.954 --> 17:21.707
I love you! I love you!
I love you! I love--

17:21.790 --> 17:23.625
- Heidi!

17:25.836 --> 17:26.627
- Can I get the dentist
back in here?

17:26.712 --> 17:29.089
- Uh, wait, full disclosure.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.258
My name is Pepper
and I'm your biggest fan.

17:31.341 --> 17:32.301
I really need to
interview you

17:32.384 --> 17:35.012
or I'll lose my show
on the school TV station.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.638
- I'm happy to help.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.557
Let's just get the tooth
thing fixed first.

17:38.640 --> 17:39.641
- You'll do the interview?
- Yeah.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.477
- I love you! I love you!
I love you! I love you!

17:41.560 --> 17:45.272
I love you! I love--
Oooh!

17:45.355 --> 17:47.316
- Fan girls. Am I right?

17:47.399 --> 17:53.906
- ♪

17:54.782 --> 17:55.991
- That's it. I have
finally finished.

17:56.074 --> 18:00.287
- Unh-unh-unh. I can't
see my reflection.

18:00.370 --> 18:02.372
- Look, I know it
was wrong of me

18:02.456 --> 18:03.916
to go to the concert.

18:03.999 --> 18:04.917
But at this point, you're just
taking advantage of me.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.836
- Uh, yeah, that's
the whole point of this.

18:07.920 --> 18:08.921
- NEWT, SAWYER, TROY:
[laughing]

18:09.004 --> 18:11.840
- And we are just
gettin' started.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.133
- That's it!

18:13.217 --> 18:15.344
I'm telling Coach the truth
about why I missed the clean-up.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.845
I don't care
if I get benched.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.138
It's better than
being your slave.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.060
- Don't worry.
She's bluffing.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.937
- But, dude, if she tells Coach
what we've been doing,

18:25.020 --> 18:28.273
we could be in more
trouble than her.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.983
- Come on, then.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.361
Bella, don't bother Coach
with that thing.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.239
He's a busy man.
- Quiet, guys.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.032
Bella?

18:37.115 --> 18:41.578
- Coach, I lied to you about
my Nana's 60th birthday party.

18:41.662 --> 18:44.081
- I knew she looked
too good to be 60.

18:44.164 --> 18:44.790
[chuckling]

18:44.873 --> 18:47.376
- No.
[nervous laugh]

18:47.459 --> 18:49.628
I mean it wasn't her birthday.

18:49.711 --> 18:53.048
I went to the Hunter Hayes
concert instead.

18:53.131 --> 18:54.633
I'm so sorry.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.678
I should have never put myself
in front of the team.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.930
I promise it'll
never happen again.

19:00.013 --> 19:04.143
- I am very disappointed
in you, Dawson.

19:04.226 --> 19:09.481
I'm glad you came clean,
even though it took you a while.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.066
- Well, glad that's
all wrapped up!

19:11.149 --> 19:13.652
See ya in practice, huh?
- COACH: Hold it!

19:13.735 --> 19:17.155
Hold it!
[chuckling]

19:17.239 --> 19:21.159
Do you guys have anything
you wanna tell me?

19:21.243 --> 19:22.744
- No.
- Nope.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.746
- Not at all.
- No?

19:24.830 --> 19:27.249
Newt!
- [gasping]

19:27.332 --> 19:31.128
- If you tell me the truth,
I'll go easy on you.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.630
- Oh, please, what's
the worst you could do?

19:33.714 --> 19:36.967
Bench me?
- TROY, NEWT, SAWYER: [laughing]

19:37.050 --> 19:41.096
- I'll send you back
to the doo-doo sheds.

19:41.179 --> 19:43.015
- Well, we found out Bella
lied about the concert

19:43.098 --> 19:45.058
and we threatened to tell you
unless she did what we asked,

19:45.142 --> 19:46.143
so she did Sawyer's homework,
got bit by Troy's ferret,

19:46.226 --> 19:49.104
and...and made me
perfectly good cupcakes

19:49.187 --> 19:50.355
which I stomped on because
I was crazed with power!

19:53.817 --> 19:55.444
Who said that?

19:55.527 --> 20:03.410
- Wow! Bella lied to me and you
guys used it against her?

20:03.493 --> 20:05.329
This is shameful.

20:05.412 --> 20:07.122
I should bench all of you.

20:07.205 --> 20:08.916
- Coach, look, please
don't bench us, okay?

20:08.999 --> 20:11.126
We'll do anything.
- Yeah.

20:11.209 --> 20:12.753
- Anything?

20:12.836 --> 20:16.423
- Gross. A hairy
chicken wing.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.926
- I recognize that
from the tornado.

20:19.009 --> 20:22.596
In a weird way,
it reminds me of Pepper.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.057
Thanks.

20:25.140 --> 20:28.644
- Uh, Coach, this isn't
a football trophy.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.562
What's this for?

20:30.646 --> 20:32.814
- The Argentine Tango.
- You dance?

20:32.898 --> 20:35.484
- I've been known to.

20:35.567 --> 20:36.401
- TROY: Oh!

20:36.485 --> 20:40.364
- Coach, haven't
we been punished enough?

20:47.996 --> 20:49.706
- Ace McFumbles here
with the world premiere

20:49.790 --> 20:52.000
of our new segment--
"Silverado Scoop."

20:52.084 --> 20:54.670
Pepper Silverstein,
take it away.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.630
- Hello, Bulldogs,

20:56.713 --> 20:58.674
I'm here with country
superstar Hunter Hayes.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.634
Tell me, Hunter,
do you like nachos?

21:00.717 --> 21:03.762
- [mouth full of cotton]
I don't really eat nachos.

21:03.845 --> 21:06.264
- Interesting.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.433
And what was your inspiration
for "Young and in Love"?

21:08.517 --> 21:11.979
- Well, it's about how when you
fall in love with somebody,

21:12.062 --> 21:14.398
and you're, you know,

21:14.481 --> 21:16.274
and you have these
life experiences,

21:16.358 --> 21:19.111
and it's just about...
[garbled]

21:26.702 --> 21:28.620
- So, what do you think?

21:28.704 --> 21:32.624
- I think your dad used
too much novocaine.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.959
He totally numbed.

21:34.042 --> 21:36.712
- Still, no one else
has this interview.

21:36.795 --> 21:39.923
Ooh, this is
my favorite part.
