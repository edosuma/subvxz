WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.294
I am the system.

00:02.586 --> 00:04.086
I consume humanity.

00:04.379 --> 00:07.216
- There is no escape.
- Objection!

00:07.508 --> 00:10.010
Jeff Winger, hero-at-law.

00:10.302 --> 00:11.803
Best lawyer you ever saw.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.597
Hero to freedom.

00:13.889 --> 00:15.182
Defender of liberty.

00:15.474 --> 00:17.142
South of the 40 at Lincoln.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.727
You park for free Jeff.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.105
Are you a good person being sued,
oppressed or beaten?

00:22.397 --> 00:25.984
I can help,
and that's the Winger Guarantee.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.862
Call 555-her...

00:29.154 --> 00:31.615
Maybe you should've spent
less money on special effects.

00:31.907 --> 00:35.619
Yeah. Thanks a lot,
Francis Ford Repo Man.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.962
Jeff Winger, loser-at-law.

00:45.254 --> 00:48.924
Rented office in a mini mall.

00:49.675 --> 00:52.010
Relax, Tango. I come in peace.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.679
Way I see it, I screwed you...

00:53.971 --> 00:56.598
I got screwed back.
Now we can bygone the bygones.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.351
I got a juicy new client
and a bone to throw you.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.353
Hear about that bridge
that collapsed?

01:01.645 --> 01:03.397
A human could say that
without salivating.

01:03.689 --> 01:06.275
I represent Marvin Humphries,
the engineer who designed it.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.943
He wants to seek damages.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.528
From what? His own pencil?

01:09.820 --> 01:13.365
From the only school reckless enough
to give him a degree in engineering.

01:13.657 --> 01:16.952
City-funded school,
deep government pockets.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.745
Maybe you've heard of it.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.331
Greendale Community College.

01:21.623 --> 01:24.126
Weird choice, by the way,
bachelor's degree on the wall.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.878
You're gonna sue my school,
you're bothering to tell me?

01:27.170 --> 01:28.171
You have access there.

01:28.463 --> 01:32.217
I need Marvin's records to prove
that he was irresponsibly educated.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.386
- Well, why don't you just subpoena?
- Right.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.805
So they can have a shredding party.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.474
That's the difference
between you and Greendale, Alan.

01:39.766 --> 01:40.976
They wouldn't shred evidence.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.811
It's a good place for good people.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.104
It's a diploma mill.

01:44.396 --> 01:46.607
It turns idiots
into bridge collapsers...

01:46.898 --> 01:50.569
and Jeff Winger into an attorney
that thought he could...

01:50.861 --> 01:53.071
help people?

01:53.363 --> 01:56.074
Jeff, I once saw you
convince an arson victim...

01:56.366 --> 01:58.243
that he liked his house better burnt.

01:59.995 --> 02:02.456
God, look what that school
did to you.

02:02.748 --> 02:05.208
It took all your money,
it took four years of your life.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.878
And worst of all,
it took your Winger moves.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.588
I still got my Winger moves.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.757
Prove it. Get me Humphries' records.

02:12.049 --> 02:15.260
Because the next bone you get thrown
might be through a dude's zipper...

02:15.552 --> 02:18.930
in the warehouse district and I can't
guarantee you it'll be from me.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.266
I might be broke, desperate,
nearly homeless...

02:21.558 --> 02:25.479
but I still got one thing deep down
inside that gives me power... That was it.

02:25.771 --> 02:26.772
That was all I had.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.692
♪ Give me some more
Time in a dream ♪

02:30.984 --> 02:34.071
♪ Give me the hope
To run out of steam ♪

02:34.363 --> 02:37.199
♪ Somebody said It can be here ♪

02:37.491 --> 02:41.411
♪ We could be roped up
Tied up dead in a year ♪

02:41.703 --> 02:46.208
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay ♪

02:46.500 --> 02:50.462
♪ One by one they all
Just fade away ♪

02:52.214 --> 02:54.049
Welcome back, human beings.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.302
Dean Pelton here, wishing you
another magic year at Greendale...

02:57.594 --> 03:00.222
ranked America's number two
community college...

03:00.514 --> 03:02.641
by
greendalecommunitycollege.com.

03:02.933 --> 03:07.020
Regarding the recent tragedy
surrounding a certain collapsed bridge...

03:07.312 --> 03:09.773
we'll be observing a moment
of silence on the quad...

03:10.065 --> 03:13.402
followed by four years of silence
to the press.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.778
I told you you'd be back.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.405
Shut up, Leonard. I'm not here.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.366
I'm just a figment
of your creeping dementia.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.749
Hi.

03:28.125 --> 03:31.086
How would I go about
getting records for certain alumni?

03:31.378 --> 03:34.339
Why would you think a stranger
could just walk in here and do that?

03:34.631 --> 03:36.091
You're Rita.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.510
- Rhonda.
- I've always regretted not telling you...

03:38.802 --> 03:42.055
how much you remind me
of my aunt.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.685
It's more disarming than it sounds.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.938
I have a very attractive aunt.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.149
Rhonda, why are you wearing
Jeff Winger's...?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.192
Jeffrey.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.195
Are you looking for your friends?
They don't go here anymore.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.865
Looking for something
in front of you the whole time?

04:00.157 --> 04:01.366
He's asking for records...

04:02.534 --> 04:03.618
for a certain alumni.

04:05.287 --> 04:08.039
In the midst of all this
Marvin Humphries business...

04:08.331 --> 04:12.711
I doubt this is a coincidence.
You're here to save me, aren't you?

04:13.378 --> 04:14.629
Yes.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.548
I thought I might contact alumni...

04:16.839 --> 04:18.048
to form a committee.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.552
The Save Greendale Committee.
Working title.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.429
Jeffrey, I'm gonna cry.

04:22.721 --> 04:25.307
- Please don't.
- Request denied.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.894
Rhonda will let you
in the records room.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.854
It's actually your old study room.

04:31.146 --> 04:35.025
After you and your friends left,
it was closed for sentimental reasons.

04:35.317 --> 04:38.403
And asbestos reasons,
but it's clean as a whistle now.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.577
"Harassment reports,
hazardous waste citations...

04:45.869 --> 04:47.746
herpes, water fountains."

04:48.038 --> 04:49.790
Come on. Where's Humphries?

04:50.081 --> 04:52.042
- I see your value now.
- Abed, why?

04:52.334 --> 04:54.461
It's a callback to when
we met first season.

04:54.753 --> 04:57.422
Me calling years "seasons"
is a callback to my dialogue and...

04:57.714 --> 04:59.257
I know what makes you off-putting...

04:59.549 --> 05:02.594
- but why are you here?
- Dean called me about the committee.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.846
- Can I join?
- Oh, no. Who else did he call?

05:05.138 --> 05:07.265
Just me. I called everyone else.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.184
Jeffrey.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.146
Jeff.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.274
- Is that cool?
- It's the coolest.

05:16.566 --> 05:20.195
Jeff, if you wanted to save Greendale,
why didn't you call us first?

05:20.487 --> 05:22.489
Well, you guys just got sprung
from this joint.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.783
And I figured you had careers
to get started.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.535
- Yeah, working hard.
- Yes.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.745
- Yeah. So many things.
- Yeah. Sandwiches...

05:29.037 --> 05:30.288
Us, always doing stuff.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.208
What have they done to our home?
The table's buried.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.005
- I got it.
- This is where we became a family.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.757
Where Jeff made us a family.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.052
We can repilot.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.138
This could be like Scrubs season nine,
a revamp, a do-over.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.559
- Jeff could come back as a teacher.
- I'm not gonna be a teacher, Abed.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.060
Come on.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.728
Sit in your chair.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.814
Complete the table.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.608
- We wanna help you save Greendale.
- Yeah.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.194
- Greendale. Greendale. Greendale.
- Save it.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.654
I gotta go to the bathroom.

06:04.531 --> 06:05.531
Give him space.

06:05.782 --> 06:06.825
Repiloting can be intense.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.703
New people show up,
regulars shift roles or even fall away.

06:09.995 --> 06:12.205
In Scrubs, Zach was only
in the first six episodes.

06:12.497 --> 06:13.498
That son of a bitch.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.501
After everything Scrubs did for him?

06:16.918 --> 06:17.918
I'm sorry.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.298
Vision boarding.

06:21.590 --> 06:22.632
Okay, vision boarding...

06:22.924 --> 06:23.925
Oh, hi, Jeffrey.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.345
I have to warn you about something
because it's the right thing to do.

06:27.637 --> 06:31.308
First, why is there a big empty box on
your desk that says "Humphries" on it?

06:35.270 --> 06:37.147
The press has been calling
about Humphries.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.774
I didn't want any details
about his enrollment here...

06:40.066 --> 06:41.443
to be spun against us...

06:41.735 --> 06:43.111
so now there are no details.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.070
That was his thesis.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.035
Okay. So sue me.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.661
This ain't Harvard, Jeffrey.

06:51.953 --> 06:55.957
Okay, my job is to give
a certain number of degrees per year...

06:56.249 --> 06:57.792
or we could get shut down.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.628
And that would be bad because...?

07:00.128 --> 07:01.880
Because then I wouldn't have a job.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.091
And, you know, Greendale
is a good place for good people.

07:05.383 --> 07:06.468
That whole spiel, huh?

07:06.843 --> 07:07.969
Yeah.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.055
That whole spiel.

07:13.642 --> 07:14.642
Wing Blade.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.645
Shock me by impressing me.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.064
- He shredded Humphries.
- What?

07:19.481 --> 07:21.566
I told you.
How could you let this happen?

07:21.858 --> 07:24.486
Sir, I have to ask you
to leave the concierge desk.

07:25.987 --> 07:29.491
Jeff, this case was all I had.
I am screwed.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.785
My wife left,
my girlfriend dumped me.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.037
And they're sisters,
whole family's pissed.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.706
Shut up. Bring me paperwork
for filing a class action.

07:36.998 --> 07:40.001
Letters of intent, engagement,
everything. Multiple copies.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.545
Winger, you just lost our client!

07:42.837 --> 07:45.590
Yeah. But I can create five new ones.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.092
So dusty. Let's get this off.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.595
- Season nine of Scrubs.
- And that's the Winger Guarantee.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.644
Okay. Maybe we should brainstorm
fundraising ideas...

07:57.936 --> 07:59.771
that aren't bake sales.

08:00.063 --> 08:03.900
Or opening a zoo where the humans are
in cages and the animals come to visit.

08:04.192 --> 08:07.112
Are you okay, Jeff?
You left kind of freaked out.

08:07.570 --> 08:11.825
Well, I can't stop thinking this school
might be in trouble...

08:12.117 --> 08:15.120
- because of this bridge guy.
- He's the one making bad bridges.

08:15.412 --> 08:18.623
That's like me blaming owls
for how much I suck at analogies.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.960
Sometimes a student will claim,
in court...

08:22.252 --> 08:24.713
that their school ruined their life...

08:25.213 --> 08:26.381
and they'll win.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.300
You wanna save Greendale?
Make it litigation-proof.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.303
- How?
- Think like the enemy.

08:32.636 --> 08:34.222
How did Greendale damage you,
Annie?

08:34.514 --> 08:36.808
It didn't.
I love hospital administration.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.977
- Is that your job?
- Well, not yet.

08:40.270 --> 08:46.151
But I administer
things to hospitals, like these. Pen?

08:47.694 --> 08:50.321
- "Futurza"?
- They're a rising star in pharmaceuticals.

08:50.613 --> 08:53.950
They invented fibromyalgia
and the cure for fibromyalgia.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.910
You push drugs now? That's ironic.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.495
I push pens, Britta.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.457
Speaking of irony,
how's the therapy market? Depressed?

09:00.749 --> 09:02.500
- I'm on sabbatical.
- You're Jewish?

09:02.792 --> 09:06.087
I'm doing hands-on research
about the psychology of alcoholism.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.756
You're a bartender, aren't you?

09:08.048 --> 09:10.050
Which is basically
like a modern-day therapist.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.677
Somebody tells me about a murder,
I can't tell anyone.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.429
You're even bad at bartending.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.764
What about you?

09:16.056 --> 09:18.641
Abed's working on the next
billion-dollar social media app.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.519
And when it takes off,
all I gotta do is sue him.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.355
- It's foolproof.
- You're programming now, Abed?

09:24.647 --> 09:26.941
Didn't get any work
with your four-year film degree?

09:27.233 --> 09:29.360
Directing a commercial.
Still haven't been paid.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.947
I'll cut you a cheque tomorrow,
but just so we're clear, you quit.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.533
- Differences.
- I asked you to put the phone number...

09:35.825 --> 09:38.036
- on the screen.
- I didn't like the number. 555?

09:38.328 --> 09:40.038
- The number of my business.
- Sounds fake.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.999
Every number starts with 555.
Are there only 10,000 numbers?

09:43.291 --> 09:44.375
Abed, you quit?

09:44.667 --> 09:47.796
Said you got fired. You haven't paid
rent in our apartment in months.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.632
Sell him a pill that will help him
give up on his dreams.

09:50.924 --> 09:54.260
Relaxabrex doesn't make you give up
on your dreams. That's a side effect.

09:54.552 --> 09:57.555
At least the drugs I sell don't
get slurped out of my belly button.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.892
- That's only on Tummy Tuesdays! Sorry...
- It's okay to...

10:01.184 --> 10:03.228
Andre left again.

10:05.688 --> 10:09.400
It's not like last time.
He's staying with family.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.736
He took the boys, he took the dog.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.071
He took the DVR.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.407
Hundred and sixty-six episodes
of Bones just gone.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.661
It was my fault this time.

10:19.953 --> 10:20.953
I cheated on him...

10:22.330 --> 10:23.915
with Shirley's Sandwiches.

10:24.207 --> 10:28.920
I threw the money into expanding.
I just didn't think I could fail.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.883
Okay.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.261
Well, just so you know...

10:36.553 --> 10:37.929
this is the sort of stuff...

10:38.221 --> 10:41.432
that someone could use
to make a claim against a school.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.941
I have to go to the bathroom again.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.110
While I'm gone...

10:52.402 --> 10:54.445
I want you to think about what I said.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.114
As an exercise.

10:59.909 --> 11:04.289
Do you guys feel weird
about doing this without Magnitude?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.380
That's everything you asked for.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.550
- Who are you flipping?
- My friends...

11:15.842 --> 11:18.011
who are now the
Save Greendale Committee...

11:18.303 --> 11:19.303
which I created.

11:20.638 --> 11:21.723
Classic Winger.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.601
I forgot what it was like
to be good at being bad.

11:24.893 --> 11:27.145
So just close the deal
and bring it home to Daddy.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.771
Sorry, Alan. Change of daddies.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.441
- I'll take it from here.
- But it's my case.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.985
- Humphries was your case.
- Jeff...

11:35.403 --> 11:36.654
- you're scaring me.
- Good.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.489
Guys like you should be more scared.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.868
You trust-funded, body-sprayed,
Eli Roth DVD-owner.

11:42.160 --> 11:45.830
You're an amateur monster and you
stomped on the grave of a real monster...

11:46.122 --> 11:49.542
who was willing to stay buried
because real monsters have shame...

11:49.834 --> 11:53.671
because they wish that... You're not
worth the monologue. Give me your tie.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.758
- What?
- No monologue for you. Give me your tie.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.969
That's for making me go
to this school.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.347
That's for making
the last four years happen.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.891
And now I get to make them
un-happen for me...

12:05.183 --> 12:08.019
and the only people I care about.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.192
I failed my husband, I failed my kids.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.069
I've failed Bones.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.530
I'm helping to hook a whole new batch
of little Annies on Adderall.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.951
I've spent so much time with computers
your tears are 1 s and 0s to me.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.662
Yeah, you were a real
Hallmark card before.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.998
I'm much sadder than the rest of you.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.209
I will figure out why later.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.211
Jeff, full disclosure.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.173
Our lives are worse
than the day we got here.

12:37.465 --> 12:41.052
Well, that is a serious allegation
to arrive at all by yourselves.

12:41.344 --> 12:42.720
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.181
And we've come to a decision
as a group...

12:45.473 --> 12:48.726
and please don't judge us
for suggesting it.

12:49.018 --> 12:52.021
- I'll back you up no matter...
- We decided to reenroll at Greendale.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.564
What? Are you nuts?

12:53.856 --> 12:56.901
Greendale! Greendale! Greendale!

12:57.193 --> 12:59.404
You guys wanna keep it down?

13:00.571 --> 13:01.906
- Chang?
- Kevin?

13:04.617 --> 13:08.246
Chang. I've dropped the amnesia thing,
copped to my crimes and went to jail.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.580
Now I'm on work release.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.249
- Working as what?
- Math teacher.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.960
- Explain the pyjamas.
- Work release from house arrest...

13:14.252 --> 13:17.213
but I don't have a home.
See this? This won't let me travel...

13:17.505 --> 13:19.090
a hundred yards from this.

13:19.382 --> 13:23.720
And this only has a 30-yard cord,
so I can only travel...

13:24.137 --> 13:26.222
- You do the math.
- You said you teach math.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.558
Exactly. I teach it, you do it.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.938
Chang was faking his Changnesia?

13:34.230 --> 13:38.192
Seriously rehired a teacher they fired
for trying to burn down the school?

13:38.484 --> 13:42.405
After being rehired as a guard after
being fired for impersonating a teacher.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.032
That's insane, and I'm Abed.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.034
Worse than insane. Irresponsible.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.827
- Evil.
- I don't believe in evil.

13:48.119 --> 13:50.955
But this school clearly got a finger
up its butt as a child.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.749
This place ruins lives.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.375
If that were true...

13:54.751 --> 13:59.839
then what could we
possibly do about it?

14:05.219 --> 14:06.554
Make them dance, Winger.

14:07.055 --> 14:10.308
Jeff, what's your evil
legal nemesis doing here?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.018
Nemesis?

14:12.435 --> 14:14.145
No, we were partners again...

14:14.854 --> 14:16.606
until I lost my usefulness.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.649
I may be evil...

14:18.941 --> 14:22.487
but your friend here
is so much more dangerous.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.323
Tell them how it took you 30 minutes
to make them think...

14:25.615 --> 14:27.658
they wanted to sue their own school.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.245
I did it.

14:31.537 --> 14:32.538
Sorry.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.666
Anyway, I'll leave you
to pick up these pieces.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.168
I'm gonna go score some blow.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.545
My dealer's a gym teacher here.

14:41.000 --> 14:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:48.971 --> 14:50.681
You were lying to us?

14:50.973 --> 14:52.642
I never lied to you.

14:52.934 --> 14:55.436
I showed you the right truth.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.856
Britta, when we met,
you were an eclectic anarchist.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.192
How did you become
the group's airhead?

15:01.484 --> 15:02.944
- Thank you?
- And, Shirley...

15:03.236 --> 15:05.405
you've gone from an
independent divorcee...

15:05.696 --> 15:07.031
striking out on her own...

15:07.323 --> 15:11.035
to a bankrupt fry cook
hoping for a call from her husband.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.371
Troy, your entire identity
has been consumed...

15:13.663 --> 15:17.125
- by your relationship with another man.
- You found my Clive Owen Tumblr.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.377
What happened to Annie,
unstoppable go-getter?

15:19.669 --> 15:21.379
There was that gas leak last year.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.673
Oh, don't blame it all
on the gas leak year.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.383
This was a four-year process.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.218
We went in one end as real people...

15:27.510 --> 15:29.804
and out the other end
as mixed-up cartoons.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.347
- Cool.
- Sure.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.058
Coming from the guy who's had
how many psychotic breaks?

15:34.350 --> 15:35.518
Including gas leak year?

15:35.810 --> 15:37.895
You all came here
with a chance to be something.

15:38.187 --> 15:41.691
And you all had that taken away
from you. Get something back.

15:41.983 --> 15:44.110
Seek damages.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.028
Sign here.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.572
But you're our hero.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.908
- I mean, in the commercial...
- The commercial was a lie.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.910
You staged a robot fight?

15:53.202 --> 15:56.414
Yeah. In real life, the robot wins.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.588
Troy?

16:06.299 --> 16:09.760
If Jeff didn't change, then Jeff is right.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.346
Case closed. Let's make some money.

16:13.181 --> 16:16.142
Okay, Jeff, if this is
what you really want to do...

16:16.434 --> 16:17.434
I'll sign.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.270
The choice to make is yours.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.272
No, it's yours.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.693
We're putting Greendale
in your hands.

16:34.619 --> 16:37.538
- Do we all have to say something?
- No, you can just sign it.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.626
- You brought us together.
- With lies.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.711
But what you do is above lying,
remember?

16:44.295 --> 16:46.255
You show us the right truth.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.635
You won't regret this.

16:56.557 --> 16:59.143
I'd like to take the study room table
in back and burn it.

16:59.435 --> 17:00.978
Burn it? Why?

17:01.270 --> 17:04.648
The same reason I never returned
Time Bandits to Blockbuster.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.817
Nobody else deserves it.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.494
Jesus.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.665
- Looks as if you've lost your way.
- Pierce?

17:20.957 --> 17:23.501
Continue on this path,
you might miss your last chance...

17:23.792 --> 17:26.503
to see the Pierce Hawthorne
Museum of Gender Sensitivity...

17:26.796 --> 17:28.673
and Sexual Potency
on the central quad.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.341
The museum and this hologram...

17:30.633 --> 17:32.843
were donated in compliance
with a court order...

17:33.135 --> 17:34.929
I'm not allowed to discuss.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.682
Let's just say some women
can't take a compliment.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.475
Unbelievable.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.353
What I am allowed to discuss
is Greendale.

17:42.645 --> 17:46.023
And I'll say this:
Don't turn your back on it.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.693
Take it from a man
with no legal right to be there.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.987
You're in a special place.

17:51.279 --> 17:54.282
A crappy place, sure, but only because
it gives crappy people...

17:54.574 --> 17:57.493
a chance to sort themselves out.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.664
Did I sound gay at the end?
Do you wanna do another take?

18:03.124 --> 18:05.501
- Jeffrey, I'm not decent.
- I know.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.212
These are the signatures
of the five people...

18:08.504 --> 18:10.965
that are crazy enough
to care about this toilet.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.551
And tonight, I almost got them
to sue it.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.554
- Heed the warning.
- It's not easy being dean, Jeffrey.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.014
Then stop being the dean.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.849
It's my whole ideantity.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.018
I mean... See what I did there?
That's proof.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.437
Get your crap together.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.731
Your job is not to hand out degrees.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.983
Your job is to make this a toilet...

18:29.275 --> 18:31.736
that people don't have to be crazy
to care about.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.864
But you could stay here
and help me save the school.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.240
For how much money?

18:36.532 --> 18:39.076
I can't offer you any money.
I could offer you a job.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.578
You just described slavery.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.414
I mean, there's nothing in the budget
for school-saver...

18:43.706 --> 18:48.002
but I could hire you as...

18:50.087 --> 18:52.214
Screw you, Abed.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.802
I'd be depressed
if these samples from work...

18:57.094 --> 18:58.971
weren't giving me
a new outlook on life.

18:59.263 --> 19:03.100
If you're interested in learning more, ask
your doctor if Joyvatrex is right for you.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.935
Oh, honey.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.521
If we sue Greendale,
can I be a surprise witness?

19:07.813 --> 19:10.358
- Wait. Don't tell me.
- Stop.

19:11.525 --> 19:13.903
- We shouldn't sue the school.
- Oh, come on!

19:14.195 --> 19:16.697
Are you trying to give us
emotional whiplash?

19:16.989 --> 19:19.784
Look, if you feel there's more work
to be done on yourselves...

19:20.076 --> 19:24.121
then as crappy as this place is,
it's a place that you can do it.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.124
- You got a job teaching here.
- I don't wanna talk about it.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.544
Well, then, I'm getting back
into forensic science.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.631
That was my actual dream.
It's my fault I bailed on it.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.716
A film degree
doesn't make me a filmmaker.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.134
I need to work with others.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.762
- I need to figure out who I am.
- I'll help you.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.639
Get out of my brain.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.974
I need to learn
how to really run a business...

19:44.266 --> 19:46.352
by my own standards,
not Greendale's.

19:46.644 --> 19:49.230
I'm gonna get a four-year
psych degree, then a master's...

19:49.522 --> 19:51.649
and become a real psychologist.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.235
Or you could find another major.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.695
A real psychologist.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.114
- How about English?
- Psychology.

19:58.406 --> 20:01.409
All right, what's important
is no matter what...

20:01.701 --> 20:06.080
we'll be trying to talk Britta into
doing something different together.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.669
Burn, hopelessness.

20:16.799 --> 20:17.967
Oh, my God!

20:18.259 --> 20:20.302
It's a fire! Somebody help us!

20:22.722 --> 20:25.349
Little victories
count for a lot around here.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.228
Good.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.897
Even if you never asked
to win in the first place.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.527
And you have to enjoy
those nice moments while you can.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.363
He does a voice-over wrap-up
at the end of every episode.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.031
Cool.

20:41.323 --> 20:44.910
Because around here,
they never last very long.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.496
Once more. More teacher-y.

20:47.788 --> 20:48.956
I wanna kill myself.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.291
Use that.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.507
Are you a good person?

20:58.799 --> 20:59.967
Yes, unlike you.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.012
I can guarantee,
the Winger beaten you.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.680
Not anymore.
