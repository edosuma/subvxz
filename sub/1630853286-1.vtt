Yep.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.515
I couldn't go any faster.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.183
It had nothing
to do with you.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.353
His heart stopped.
He's lost too much blood.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.021
We did everything we could.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.067
Sorry for your loss.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.443

<i>Dr. Kersey,

03:25.122 --> 03:29.042
What? Now you're gonna go
save the animal that shot him?

03:29.751 --> 03:31.378
If I can.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.785
I think
it's running a little slow.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.246
Maybe it's time
for a new one.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.040
No, I like this one.
Mmm.

04:11.293 --> 04:12.627
They said 9:00.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.338
She's going to get in.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.675
I know.
I just miss envelopes.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.303
None of this online crap.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.847
on, my God! Yes!

04:25.056 --> 04:26.308
That sounds like
a good scream.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.727
That sounded like
a very good scream.

04:33.482 --> 04:34.566
Oh, hey, guys, What's up?

04:34.733 --> 04:37.235
Hi, baby.
You want some breakfast?

04:37.402 --> 04:39.362
Mmm-hmm. How are you?
How you doing?

04:39.529 --> 04:41.406
I'm good.
Yeah? You're hungry?

04:42.407 --> 04:44.534
Yeah, I'm starving.
Want some eggs?

04:44.618 --> 04:46.077
Mmm. Yes, please.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.664
Are you excited
for your game?

04:49.748 --> 04:51.792
Eh. It's just a game.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.961
Hey, I thought
I heard a noise upstairs.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.379
Did you hear anything?

04:56.922 --> 04:58.882
Yeah, I thought I heard
something, what was that?

05:00.300 --> 05:03.637
Thank you.
I got in. I got in! I got in!

05:05.764 --> 05:07.015
So happy, honey.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.392
I'm so happy for you! I'm gonna
be living in New York City!

05:13.814 --> 05:17.108
I will fly home on weekends to
do laundry, okay? I promise.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.485
Okay, okay, good.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.446
Oh, my God. I have to text
Sophie to see if she got in.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.372
Our girl
is going to college.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.290
L'm happy-

05:32.457 --> 05:33.792
Really.
Yeah?

05:34.292 --> 05:35.877
I think you have to tell that
to your face.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.379
Mmm. Baby.
Mmm.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.757
Don't stop! Come here!

05:40.841 --> 05:42.926
Watch the defender.
Go, go, go!

05:44.427 --> 05:46.596
All right, come on, Jordan.
Let's go, Jordan!

05:46.680 --> 05:48.139
- Jordan!
- Let's go!

05:50.392 --> 05:51.768
I guess I always had it
in my head

05:51.852 --> 05:54.521
that she'd go to Northwestern.
Someplace close.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.690
Yeah. You think
my dad was happy

05:56.773 --> 05:58.733
when I wanted to leave Texas
to go to college?

05:58.900 --> 06:00.360
Well, this is different.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.862
How's it different?

06:02.028 --> 06:04.364
It's just that now we are
the ones that have to let go.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.409
That's a foul! Hey!
That was cleats up!

06:07.576 --> 06:09.786
What the fuck, ref?
Oh.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.371
MAN 23 Really?

06:11.538 --> 06:13.790
I guess I didn't think
it would happen so fast.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.209
That's a bullshit pass,
Brianna. You know that!

06:17.002 --> 06:18.420
I think we're gonna see her
more than we think.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.630
Because we've got, um,
Thanksgiving,

06:20.714 --> 06:21.965
we've got Christmas...
Mmm.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.508
And we get to go
to New York City.

06:23.675 --> 06:26.386
Foul! That's another foul!

06:26.469 --> 06:28.138
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy, pal.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.306
You're gonna give yourself
a heart attack.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.642
I wasn't talking to you,
Lake Shore Drive.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.605
No, as a matter of fact,
you were talking to everyone.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.941
Just dial down the language,
there's kids here.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.026
Or what?

06:43.153 --> 06:44.237
Uh, Paul, come on.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.531
I would just shut the fuck up
if I were you.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.534
That's a good idea.
Why don't you do that?

06:50.702 --> 06:56.041
Be me, and just shut the...
Fuck up.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.585
You think that's funny?

07:01.087 --> 07:02.088
Say it again.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.882
Come on, funny guy.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.508
Say it again.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.095
Now you're quiet, huh?

07:09.262 --> 07:11.723
- Come on! Come on!
- Stop it!

07:11.973 --> 07:13.975
Stop it! Stop it!
Come here.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.937
Oh, that's right.
Get your wife to defend you.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.688
Pussy.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.443
It's all right. All right.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.907
Okay, so then the guy gets
right in Dad's face, okay?

07:29.074 --> 07:31.159
And he starts shoving him and
it literally stops the game.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.327
Spitting right in my face.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.787
I had to get in
the middle of it.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.664
I was gonna punch
the guy. Right?

07:35.830 --> 07:38.166
Why didn't you
whoop this guy's butt?

07:38.333 --> 07:39.417
Like in the old days.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.294
Thank God your mom came over.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.505
Wait, Dad, the "old days"?

07:43.672 --> 07:45.674
- Yeah, your dad was a scrapper.
- Yeah, I was a scrapper.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.425
Really?
You never told me that!

07:47.592 --> 07:49.636
He would've,
back in the day.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.304
Tell her. Tell her.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.847
I used to fight my dad.
Oh.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.599
Fighting all the time.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.810
You know, he was screaming
and crying in the house.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.019
And guess who was crying?

07:58.269 --> 07:59.854
Me. I lost every fight.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.982
Terrible.
I still love you, Dad.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.442
You should take Krav Maga.
You study that.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.695
This way, when you go
to college, and these guys,

08:06.861 --> 08:09.489
when they get a little too aggressive
with you, you know what to do.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.032
Don't look at me like I don't
know what I'm talking about.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.201
No, no. Yeah, I'm just saying,
like, maybe I already know it.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.285
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:14.369 --> 08:15.370
- Jordan!
- All right, all right.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.454
I tapped out.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.415
Seriously, she trains Monday,

08:18.498 --> 08:20.417
Wednesday, and Friday,
this one. Watch out.

08:20.583 --> 08:21.668
Really?
I'm training.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.086
And I actually found
a boxing gym in Tribeca

08:23.169 --> 08:24.212
that all
the supermodels go to.

08:24.379 --> 08:25.714
So I'm gonna start
going there.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.634
And speaking of college,
how about your PhD?

08:29.801 --> 08:31.428
Oh, that's very nice of you
to remember.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.721
How about that?

08:32.886 --> 08:35.222
Yes, 15 years in the making,
lam soon to be a doctor.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.767
Cheers to Mom, right?
How about that? Come on.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.019
Two Dr. Kerseys.
Can you believe it?

08:39.102 --> 08:40.102
Two doctors.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.855
Are you gonna call me Doctor?
Yes, I am.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.481
You are?
I'm gonna call you Dr. Baby.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.692
Cheers to Dr. Kersey.
Thank you.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.736
How about two Kerseys
that aren't doctors?

08:47.902 --> 08:50.530
How about cheers to us?
Non-doctors.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.492
I wanna get the big puffy
jackets, UGG slippers...

09:03.084 --> 09:04.169
How much?

09:04.335 --> 09:05.420
Two grand.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.340
What? Two grand, what?
Hey, man.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.384
You know, I've been convicted
of a crime.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.927
I mean, it's not like
I'm a criminal, but...

09:14.763 --> 09:16.431
This cashmere?

09:19.434 --> 09:20.727
It's okay.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.103
All right, thanks, man.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.230
Pauly, thank you.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.649
No worries.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.196
He's got the money. Not me.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.447
Hey, thank you so much.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.075

10:43.852 --> 10:45.019
You guys ready?

10:48.314 --> 10:49.440
Hi, Susan.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.401
I was just trying on
my birthday present.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.946
No, I had worked it out
with Terry.

10:55.905 --> 10:56.906
He's...

11:02.412 --> 11:03.788
Okay.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.207
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, see you soon.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.502
Terry has a 104 fever.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.212
So, no birthday dinner
at La Fonda?

11:11.588 --> 11:12.589
Mmm-mmm.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.719
I'll go tell Uncle Frank.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.804
Sorry, Daddy.
Oh, it's all right, hon.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.348
L just had my heart set
on that tres leches cake.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.225
I know, me too.
We'll have it soon.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.393
All right, baby.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.273
We will celebrate
tomorrow night.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.111
Don't worry at all,
I promise.

11:35.278 --> 11:36.362
Try and stay awake.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.488
Okay, lwill.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.617
Okay. I'm sorry.
lwill. Bye, honey.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.118
It's all right.

11:46.497 --> 11:47.498
<i>Hey, Paul.</i>

11:48.458 --> 11:49.792
Happy birthday, old man.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.002
Oh, come on.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.754
First baseline.
You don't get me anything.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.464
You better be taking me
to that game.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.944
Why can't we just Postmates
La Fonda? It's so much easier.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.071
Our cake is gonna be
so much better

12:18.154 --> 12:19.614
because we're gonna make it
with love.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.407
Yeah, but La Fonda makes it
with love.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.451
And we know that
Dad already loves it,

12:23.534 --> 12:24.702
so it's kind of a win-win.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.079
No, it's his birthday.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.332
He's gonna love knowing that
we actually made the effort.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.458
We did the work.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.794
So we can make the effort
to dirty up the kitchen,

12:32.961 --> 12:34.879
and then when he gets home, we just
pretend that we cooked all night.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.506
Honey, we're making the cake.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.178
Honey, could you get me
my iPad?

12:42.595 --> 12:43.930
I think it's upstairs
on the nightstand.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.181
Sure.

12:45.556 --> 12:46.557
Thank you.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.439
Hi, Soph.

12:54.399 --> 12:55.984
I can't hear you.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.244
Okay, so I've narrowed it down
to two options.

13:06.411 --> 13:09.289
I'm thinking either
Third North or Seventh Street.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.790
Third North
has bigger bedrooms

13:10.957 --> 13:12.375
but I think that
Seventh Street is just, like,

13:12.458 --> 13:13.626
a way cooler area.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.833
Honey, did you get that iPad?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.835
Yeah, it was in your dresser,
not on it.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.905
Jordan? Can you please
come down here? I need it.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.587
Jordan, come down here,
right now.

14:39.754 --> 14:42.131
Mom, lam grabbing
a charger, relax.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.384
So what are you guys
gonna do tonight?

14:44.467 --> 14:45.760
Jordan!

14:45.843 --> 14:48.012
Oh, my God. Will you calm
down? I said I'm coming.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.263
Now!

14:49.430 --> 14:51.974
I'm gonna have to oall you back.
My morn is being a total psycho.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.187
No!

15:04.404 --> 15:06.364
Mom.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.033
Put the fucking phone down
right now.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.911
No.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.414
Please. Please don't hurt her.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.834
Don't hurt her, please!

15:17.917 --> 15:19.001
Shh.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.713
Shh. Shh.

15:22.797 --> 15:25.550
Now here's
what's gonna happen.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.636
Morn, you're gonna save me 20
minutes by opening the safe.

15:28.719 --> 15:29.720
Okay.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.472
Then I'm gonna tie you up
with your daughter,

15:31.639 --> 15:33.808
so you won't be calling anyone
till we're long gone.

15:33.891 --> 15:34.892
Okay.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.310
Now if you could do that,
nobody gets hurt.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.395
Okay.

15:37.478 --> 15:38.771
You understand me?
Mmm-hmm.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.481
Go on.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.275
Mom,Mom!

15:42.442 --> 15:44.819
Don't hurt her.
Do not hurt her.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.571
Oh, that's entirely up to you.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.283
It's okay, Mom.
Just do it. Just go.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.659
Tie her up.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.120
No fucking games.

15:54.579 --> 15:55.788
We need to move.

16:02.253 --> 16:03.463
Hey.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.715
Hey, no fucking games.
What, are you deaf?

16:05.882 --> 16:07.008
Put that thing away.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.343
All right, man. Relax.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.846
Jesus. THE FISH:
Just fucking watch her.

16:16.184 --> 16:19.395
My husband has two watches,
there's cash...

16:19.562 --> 16:21.272
You can take it all.
Whatever you want.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.733
That's nice. Thank you.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.033
Where's the rope, girl?

16:34.410 --> 16:35.745
Check the garage.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.100
Don't get amnesia on me.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.311
I'm sorry.
I'm just not used to doing it

17:00.394 --> 17:01.479
with a gun pointed at me.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.648
Yeah, well, get used to it.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.451
You play sports?

17:23.459 --> 17:25.044
You look like
you play sports.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.253
No.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.339
- Shh.
- No, no, stop.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.133
Did you say something?

17:32.176 --> 17:33.177
Please don't.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.054
Please don't.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.234
Oh, you can do it.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.736
And then we're done.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.991
Goddamn, you're strong.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.660
That's good.

17:58.995 --> 17:59.996
No.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.080
- No,no,no.
- Please.

18:01.247 --> 18:04.083
It's nice.
It's nice. It's good.

18:07.712 --> 18:08.713
I got it.

18:25.688 --> 18:28.316
Hey. Hey, what the fuck
is your rush, bro?

18:28.482 --> 18:30.359
We don't have time
for this shit.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.528
Just give me
two fucking minutes, please.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.988
I'm begging you,
two minutes, please.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.115
It's not that kind of a party,
all right?

18:36.991 --> 18:39.076
Why don't you just stop being
such a fucking pussy?

18:39.577 --> 18:41.412
What the fuck?
What the fuck, man?

18:44.832 --> 18:45.958
God damn it!

18:46.375 --> 18:47.376
Fuck!

18:50.254 --> 18:51.881
Fuck! God damn it!

18:52.048 --> 18:53.758
- You motherfucker!
- No!

18:54.050 --> 18:55.968
No! No!
The fuck are you doing?

18:56.135 --> 18:57.595
She cut my fucking face!

18:57.762 --> 18:59.388
She can see your fucking face!

19:01.182 --> 19:02.183
Mom!

19:05.186 --> 19:06.771
Jordan, run!

19:07.772 --> 19:08.814
FUCK it.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.198
<i>Trauma,
two incoming, Level One.</i>

19:17.365 --> 19:19.659
<i>Female, 17,
basal skull fracture.</i>

19:19.742 --> 19:22.411
<i>Female, 43,
gunshot wound to the chest.</i>

19:22.953 --> 19:25.039
Dr. Simone, would you mind
closing, please?

19:25.206 --> 19:26.749
Yes, doctor.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.460
Put her on the monitor. Get two
lV's and put her on oxygen.

19:29.543 --> 19:30.544
Yes.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.713
Jordan, open your eyes.
Open your eyes, Jordan.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.466
She needs to be intubated. Prepare
100 milligrams of propofol...

19:44.183 --> 19:45.351
Doc, hold up, man.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.894
It's fine, it's fine.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.188
Listen. Paul,
something's happened.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.399
You can't go in there.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.030
Where are they?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.240
Paul. Paul.

19:59.407 --> 20:00.408
Where is she?

20:01.575 --> 20:03.452
They took your daughter
up to surgery, doc.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.454
Your wife's in Two.

20:05.621 --> 20:06.622
Lucy!

20:11.794 --> 20:12.878
Paul...

20:13.671 --> 20:15.631
We did everything we could.

20:55.463 --> 20:56.547
Baby.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.392
<i>Our passports,
Jordan's birth certificate,</i>

21:08.559 --> 21:11.020
$2,000 in cash...

21:12.980 --> 21:14.857
My Stanford class ring,

21:15.149 --> 21:17.568
two Panerai watches
on the desk.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.488
Can you describe the watches?

21:21.614 --> 21:23.115
One was all black.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.201
The other one...

21:27.244 --> 21:30.498
It was a birthday present.
Silver and black.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.417
Were there any firearms
in the house?

21:33.626 --> 21:34.877
No.

21:35.211 --> 21:36.754
A lot of these guys,

21:36.837 --> 21:39.298
they break in looking for guns
'cause they're easy to sell.

21:40.007 --> 21:43.010
I had a couple of assholes break
in to my house looking for mine.

21:43.177 --> 21:44.470
So that's what
you think this was?

21:44.553 --> 21:46.180
It was a robbery gone bad?

21:46.347 --> 21:48.641
Well, there have been a string of
break-ins along the North Shore.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.934
So we're looking
at the possibility.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.102
You said string.
How many in this string?

21:54.104 --> 21:56.106
Uh, six,
in the last nine months.

21:56.273 --> 22:00.069
Six? Six robberies.
Did you know about this?

22:00.277 --> 22:01.612
No, I didn't know about it.

22:01.779 --> 22:02.905
What, you don't think
it's important enough

22:02.988 --> 22:04.073
to tell the residents?

22:04.240 --> 22:06.784
We post every crime
on the Neighborhood Watch.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.078
If it's big enough, the media
picks it up and reports about it.

22:09.245 --> 22:11.288
If not,
these are just burglaries.

22:11.455 --> 22:12.998
Just burglaries.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.167
Frank, that's not what he
meant No, I'm just wondering,

22:15.334 --> 22:17.962
if it's important enough now,
to go on their radar...

22:18.128 --> 22:19.129
You're not helping.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.048
You guys,
it's been a long night.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.467
I think we got enough
to start with.

22:23.634 --> 22:24.885
Yeah.
Yeah.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.512
This is my card.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.638
Thanks.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.348
It's got my cell phone number
on there,

22:29.431 --> 22:31.225
if you've got anything else.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.727
Thank you, Detective Raines.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.605
You know,
I... I get that you're upset.

22:38.107 --> 22:39.483
We're upset, too.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.403
But we're gonna
get these guys.

22:45.489 --> 22:48.325
Again, I'm... I'm deeply
sorry for your loss.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.661
Thank you.
Thanks for your time.

22:50.828 --> 22:53.622
Dr. Kersey, your daughter's
out of surgery.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.002
Her surgery went well.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.672
She's still in a coma,
but she's stable.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.217
They were able
to evacuate the hematoma

23:05.301 --> 23:06.802
and remove
the bullet fragments.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.723
I wish I had more to tell you.

23:20.983 --> 23:24.987
So, I gotta take Mom home
to Grandpa today.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.492
Uncle Frank's gonna take over
reading duties for now.

23:32.328 --> 23:37.458
I love you so much.
Oh, so much, baby.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.795
I'll see you soon, kiddo.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.925
When Lucy's
mother passed,

23:46.884 --> 23:48.761
she turned to me and said,

23:49.178 --> 23:51.555
"Why did God take her
so soon?"

23:53.724 --> 23:57.603
All I could say was,
"Honey, I don't know.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.272
"L think
it's part of His plan.

24:00.856 --> 24:03.275
"And we have to trust
His plan."

24:06.654 --> 24:11.116
We used to come up here
and visit her and...

24:12.910 --> 24:13.911
Well...

24:17.581 --> 24:19.208
Now here I am.

24:20.042 --> 24:23.879
And I'm seeing something
I was never meant to see.

24:25.339 --> 24:28.425
How is this
part of His plan?

24:30.427 --> 24:32.513
How is this part of any plan?

24:40.020 --> 24:42.481
Thank you, Paul,
for bringing her home.

24:43.732 --> 24:47.611
This is where she wanted
to be. With her mom.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.655
One day, I'll join 'em.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.075
There'll always be
a place here for you.

24:55.619 --> 24:56.912
Thanks.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.623
Have the police
gotten anywhere?

24:59.790 --> 25:04.670
One of the neighbors saw three
repairmen in a white van.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.131
The police seem
pretty confident.

25:33.157 --> 25:34.616
Oh, damn. Run!

25:37.661 --> 25:39.580
Poachers! Come on!

25:44.835 --> 25:46.086
Go, go!

25:55.262 --> 25:58.766
People rely on the police
to keep them safe.

26:00.642 --> 26:02.686
That's the problem.

26:03.604 --> 26:04.772
The police only arrive

26:04.855 --> 26:07.316
after the crime
has taken place.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.359
That's like...

26:10.444 --> 26:12.071
Trapping the fox

26:12.154 --> 26:14.281
as he's comin' out
of the hen house.

26:16.784 --> 26:19.703
If a man really wants
to protect what's his...

26:22.331 --> 26:24.458
He has to do it for himself.

26:29.213 --> 26:30.964
<i>All right, this is
The Loop. I'm the Mancow.</i>

26:31.048 --> 26:32.925
<i>7:15, a quarter past 7:00.</i>

26:33.008 --> 26:35.344
<i>Good morning. Another great
weekend here, the city of death.</i>

26:35.511 --> 26:36.970
<i>Forty-eight people shot
over the weekend.</i>

26:37.054 --> 26:39.056
<i>Forty-eight
freaking people shot.</i>

26:39.223 --> 26:41.725
<i>Thirteen dead. And this...
It's getting worse.</i>

26:41.892 --> 26:42.935
<i>The numbers are up.</i>

26:43.018 --> 26:44.937
<i>You wonder how much more
of this we can take.</i>

26:45.354 --> 26:46.980
<i>I'm sorry,
Dr. Kersey, nothing yet.</i>

26:47.147 --> 26:48.190
Nothing?

26:48.273 --> 26:49.942
<i>Don't be alarmed.
It's not uncommon.</i>

26:50.109 --> 26:51.693
<i>Forensics usually takes
a week or two.</i>

26:51.860 --> 26:53.362
<i>Uh, same with informants.</i>

26:54.363 --> 26:55.656
Hey!

26:56.406 --> 26:58.659
I'm sorry. Some asshole's
trying to clean my windshield.

26:58.826 --> 27:00.577
Hey, that's enough. Go on.

27:01.161 --> 27:03.122
<i>Run 'em over.
Doesn't count as</i> a <i>crime.</i>

27:03.288 --> 27:04.414
I can do that?

27:04.581 --> 27:06.333
<i>Look, I have someone
in my office right now,</i>

27:06.500 --> 27:08.001
<i>but Detective Jackson and I
are all over this, okay?</i>

27:08.168 --> 27:09.294
Hey! That's it!

27:10.087 --> 27:12.214
<i>We'll get back to you as soon
as we have more information.</i>

27:12.381 --> 27:14.174
Come on! Just do something.
Yep.

27:15.134 --> 27:18.804
Fuck you!
Yes, fuck me.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.515
Spare some change, man?
Come on, man.

27:23.851 --> 27:26.270
<i>"Normative economics

27:26.436 --> 27:28.063

27:28.147 --> 27:29.565
"of positive economics.

27:30.983 --> 27:31.984

27:33.235 --> 27:35.404
Hi.
Dr. Kersey, hi.

27:36.613 --> 27:37.823
The nurses let me
come in here.

27:37.906 --> 27:38.907
No, it's okay.

27:39.575 --> 27:41.243
I'm glad you're here.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.078
How are you doing?

27:43.704 --> 27:46.415
I'm okay. How are you?

27:46.748 --> 27:49.209
Doing okay. Thank you.

27:49.376 --> 27:50.961
What are you reading?

27:51.378 --> 27:56.175
<i>Um, Essays in Positive
Economics</i> by <i>Milton Friedman.</i>

27:56.341 --> 27:58.635
I'm not sure
that's gonna help her wake up.

27:58.719 --> 28:01.305
Yeah, I know, it's boring.

28:01.555 --> 28:02.598
Um...

28:02.681 --> 28:04.558
But it's on
the NYU summer reading list

28:04.641 --> 28:06.643
and I'm reading it
anyway, so...

28:08.353 --> 28:10.731
I thought, I don't know,
maybe this way...

28:11.690 --> 28:13.775
This way,
she won't get behind.

28:16.445 --> 28:17.946
I can leave, if you want.

28:18.113 --> 28:21.408
No, no. Stay. Stay.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.535
It'd be good for her.

28:26.121 --> 28:27.331
Dr. Kersey...

28:29.791 --> 28:31.293
Do you think it helps?

28:31.710 --> 28:33.503
I know it does.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.177
I can't sleep on our bed.

28:41.511 --> 28:45.724
So I sleep on the couch.
I watch TV until I pass out.

28:48.769 --> 28:50.395
Even then I...

28:51.230 --> 28:52.898
I'm just not
getting any sleep.

28:53.148 --> 28:55.234
That's to be expected.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.445
I can prescribe sleeping pills
if it gets worse.

28:59.154 --> 29:01.240
I feel like I'm in purgatory.

29:01.823 --> 29:06.245
I can't go back to work,
I can't be around my house.

29:09.539 --> 29:10.874
When I was a kid,

29:11.416 --> 29:14.628
I used to ride the trains
to avoid my father.

29:16.630 --> 29:19.007
<i>And I would
even do my homework then,</i>

29:19.091 --> 29:21.510
<i>just to stay away from him.</i>

29:23.595 --> 29:24.638
<i>So...</i>

29:25.973 --> 29:27.182
<i>I've been doing that.</i>

29:28.141 --> 29:30.018
<i>Just riding the trains...</i>

29:32.562 --> 29:33.981
<i>Just to think.</i>

29:40.570 --> 29:43.991
<i>I wish I could say everything
I see reminds me of Lucy.</i>

29:45.867 --> 29:48.203
<i>But everything I see
reminds me of them.</i>

29:49.329 --> 29:50.956
<i>The men I've never seen.</i>

29:57.004 --> 29:59.006
<i>The men who came
and took her from me.</i>

30:01.091 --> 30:02.634
<i>This is Detective Kevin Raines</i>

<i>Otherwise,

<i>I thank God for Jordan.</i>

31:08.742 --> 31:09.743
Yes.

31:11.912 --> 31:13.497
This is a process.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.332
And it's gonna take time.

31:15.499 --> 31:16.583
Yeah, I know it's a process.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.128
I'm just...

31:22.172 --> 31:25.592
Starting to wonder
about the result, that's all.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.526
Listen,
I understand the process

31:42.609 --> 31:43.610
takes a little bit of time,
all right?

31:43.777 --> 31:45.779
Just fill out all the boxes
on this application.

31:45.946 --> 31:48.281
Take a seat, and we'll get
to you as soon as possible.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.412
Hello, sir.
Fill out this application,

31:53.495 --> 31:55.247
every single box, please.

32:21.815 --> 32:22.816
Sir, can I help you?

32:22.983 --> 32:25.110
Yeah, I'm here
to see Detective Raines.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.112
Detective Raines. Do you have
an appointment, sir?

32:27.446 --> 32:28.488
No. No, I don't.

32:28.655 --> 32:30.031
My name is Paul Kersey.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.243
K-U-R...

32:33.326 --> 32:34.327
E-R...

32:34.411 --> 32:35.495
Sorry about that.
It's all right.

32:35.579 --> 32:38.081
Hey, Dr. Kersey.
Dr. Kersey, come on back.

32:38.457 --> 32:39.958
Thank you. Thanks.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.251
Buzz him in, Willy.

32:41.418 --> 32:43.003
Yeah.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.468
What about the DNA
in the blood and skin

32:49.551 --> 32:51.094
from the guy that got burned?

32:51.261 --> 32:52.471
We got that test back.

32:52.554 --> 32:54.431
It didn't match anybody
in our database.

32:54.598 --> 32:55.765
But we can use it
to put 'em there

32:55.849 --> 32:57.058
when we get one in custody.

32:59.853 --> 33:00.854
Yeah, Raines.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.024
Get a number,
I'll call him back.

33:11.198 --> 33:12.699
<i>GSA'?</i>

33:12.866 --> 33:14.868
Cleared. Closed by arrest.

33:17.871 --> 33:20.123
So all these other ones
are open cases?

33:20.874 --> 33:21.875
Yep.

33:24.211 --> 33:25.587
Most of these
are gang-related.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.714
Just asshole-on-asshole
violence.

33:27.881 --> 33:30.425
Some banger posts some shit
on social media

33:30.592 --> 33:32.761
and they retaliate
with an AR-15.

33:34.387 --> 33:36.515
Last weekend,
a guy shot up a party.

33:36.681 --> 33:41.436
One guy shoots 14 people,
no one sees anything.

33:42.354 --> 33:45.273
They don't talk to the cops,
that's why these stay open.

33:47.359 --> 33:50.570
Point is,
your wife's case is different.

33:52.364 --> 33:53.740
You wanna have a seat?

33:53.907 --> 33:54.908
Thanks.

33:56.409 --> 33:59.246
I mean, that's three burglars
who panicked.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.872
I guarantee
at least one of 'em

34:00.956 --> 34:02.791
is shittin' himself somewhere.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.376
He's got a friend
who's gonna get picked up

34:04.459 --> 34:05.752
on something unrelated.

34:05.919 --> 34:08.588
He's gonna sell his buddy down
the river for his own freedom.

34:08.672 --> 34:09.672
Okay?

34:09.839 --> 34:12.132
I've seen guys
turn in their own mother.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.594
What if I offered
some kind of reward?

34:14.761 --> 34:16.763
We'll just get flooded
with false leads.

34:16.929 --> 34:18.306
Me and my partner
are gonna have to

34:18.389 --> 34:20.016
waste time tracking 'em down.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.726
What about
a private investigator?

34:23.103 --> 34:27.190
Pl's good for cheating
spouses, missing persons...

34:27.774 --> 34:30.402
But murder case,
they'll just take your money.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.029
They can't get involved
in a police investigation.

34:33.196 --> 34:36.408
It's tampering with evidence,
they could lose their license.

34:36.574 --> 34:37.867
So there's nothing
that I can do.

34:37.951 --> 34:39.494
Is that what you're saying?

34:39.911 --> 34:41.788
You can have faith.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.588
How'd faith
work out for them?

34:51.130 --> 34:53.717
<i>This is

34:53.882 --> 34:56.136

<i>This is Red Line train

35:07.647 --> 35:08.648
Hey, mama.

35:08.815 --> 35:10.025
What's poppin', redbone?

35:10.191 --> 35:12.110
Look at you.
Where you going, baby?

35:12.277 --> 35:13.403
Can I come with you?

35:13.486 --> 35:14.946
Look at your fine ass.
Look at them thick-ass thighs.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.407
Can I get your number, baby?
Can I call?

35:17.574 --> 35:18.783
Hey!

35:21.077 --> 35:22.621
What the fuck you say, <i>puto?</i>

35:22.787 --> 35:23.955
Just leave her alone.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.041
Fuck you talking to?

35:26.207 --> 35:27.459
Just leave her alone.

35:28.043 --> 35:29.169
What the fuck
is your problem?

35:30.712 --> 35:32.797
Punk-ass. Who the fuck
you think you are'?

35:53.818 --> 35:56.196
<i>I don't shoot to kill,

35:57.197 --> 36:00.075

<i>When seconds count,

<i>Come on down to Jolly Roger's.</i>

36:08.041 --> 36:10.418
<i>We've got some badass deals
on our F-1 firearms.</i>

36:10.502 --> 36:11.586
<i>Ooh, and right now,</i>

36:11.670 --> 36:13.922
<i>we have a special

36:14.089 --> 36:15.340
<i>Surprise 'em.</i>

36:16.299 --> 36:18.385
Okay, here's a good one
for you. Easy on the...

36:21.554 --> 36:23.306
No, no, hold it, son.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.184
<i>First gun'?</i>

36:27.018 --> 36:28.812
Uh,yeah.

36:28.895 --> 36:30.438
It can be
pretty overwhelming at first.

36:31.231 --> 36:32.232
I'll say.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.900
Don't worry, I got your back.
I'm Bethany.

36:34.401 --> 36:35.860
Hi.
Welcome to Jolly Roger's.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.112
Come on back,
let me show you around.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.741
So over here we have
all of our bladed weapons.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.284
Behind me on this wall
are all of our rifles.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.830
Each one comes with
a free case and two PMAGs.

36:46.996 --> 36:48.581
And if you follow me
over here,

36:48.665 --> 36:49.958
all of our new pistols
are over there.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.627
And all of our used weapons
are right here.

36:54.671 --> 36:56.089
Used?
Oh.

36:56.256 --> 36:59.509
Not used in crimes, obviously.
But, you know, used.

36:59.926 --> 37:02.345
Now, personally,
for taking care of business,

37:02.429 --> 37:04.597
my very favorite
is right over here.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.516
Forgive me for asking,

37:06.599 --> 37:09.436
but what is the process for all of this?
There must be a lot of paperwork, right?

37:09.769 --> 37:11.396
Oh.

37:11.563 --> 37:12.939
Don't even worry.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.734
We'll get you set up with your
FOID application right here today.

37:16.526 --> 37:17.902
State Police send it
pretty quick.

37:17.986 --> 37:20.196
And then you'll just have to
take a gun safety class,

37:20.363 --> 37:22.365
but don't worry,
no one ever fails.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.451
You can do that anytime
within 30 days

37:24.534 --> 37:26.244
of the time period you're
waiting for your city permit.

37:26.369 --> 37:27.787
And then it's just <i>72</i> hours,

37:27.871 --> 37:30.540
and you're cocked, locked,
and ready to rock.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.251
Ooh, and we can set you up
with a gun safe.

37:33.418 --> 37:34.419
If someone ever steals
that gun,

37:34.544 --> 37:36.713
those bullets can be traced
right back to you.

37:39.883 --> 37:42.093
I'm gonna think about it...

37:42.260 --> 37:43.261
And I'll come back.

37:43.428 --> 37:44.804
Great, just ask for Bethany.

37:46.598 --> 37:50.268
<i>Dr. Kersey,
OR Two. Dr. Kersey, OR Two.</i>

37:52.645 --> 37:53.813
Put him on the monitor
and oxygen.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.399
On my count.

37:56.566 --> 37:58.276
Three, two, one.

38:00.153 --> 38:01.821
And breathe. Good.

38:01.905 --> 38:04.574
Blood's on its way.
Get an IV. Get his pants off.

38:05.325 --> 38:07.535
Okay.
Take it easy, you're okay.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.333
You'll be all right, sir.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.645
<i>This is the Glock 17,</i>

38:33.853 --> 38:36.856
<i>arguably the most
iconic pistol of all time.</i>

38:37.023 --> 38:39.108
<i>Today, I'm gonna teach you
how to take it apart.</i>

38:39.818 --> 38:43.780
<i>Then put it back together
by simply reversing the steps.</i>

38:43.988 --> 38:46.658
<i>Put slight backwards pressure
on the slide,</i>

38:46.741 --> 38:48.660
<i>and the slide
will release forward.</i>

38:48.827 --> 38:50.578
<i>Step three, remove the barrel.</i>

39:19.899 --> 39:21.734
<i>Brush from the breach end
of the barrel.</i>

39:22.610 --> 39:24.112
<i>I do this four
to five times or until...</i>

39:54.309 --> 39:56.352
Dr. Kersey to ICU.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.938
<i>Dr. Kersey,
please report to ICU.</i>

40:14.621 --> 40:15.830
<i>She's had a seizure.</i>

40:15.914 --> 40:17.540
ls she gonna be okay?

40:17.916 --> 40:19.542
The only thing
we know for sure

40:19.709 --> 40:22.587
is her odds get less
every day.

40:25.632 --> 40:27.050
She's in handcuffs.

40:29.385 --> 40:31.429
My daughter is in handcuffs.

40:32.472 --> 40:35.141
And the men who did it
are out there.

40:35.308 --> 40:37.018
Free.

40:39.979 --> 40:42.273
Look what these animals
did to my baby.

41:37.537 --> 41:39.205
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41:39.288 --> 41:40.289
So...

41:45.294 --> 41:46.671
Keys, now!

41:47.130 --> 41:48.631
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, man. Come on, man.

41:48.715 --> 41:49.799
Give it up, bitch.

41:49.882 --> 41:50.883
It's all right.
Come on, man.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.052
Hey!

42:03.438 --> 42:04.439
Ah!

43:18.888 --> 43:22.558
It's okay, it's okay,
get out of here. Go! Go!

44:18.614 --> 44:19.615
Move over.

44:44.849 --> 44:46.142
<i>A</i> rainy <i>July...</i>

44:46.309 --> 44:47.894
<i>Tickets
are now on sale for the...</i>

44:48.060 --> 44:49.770
<i>Chicago's teacher's
union has taken the first step...</i>

45:07.705 --> 45:08.956
Hey!

45:13.294 --> 45:14.629
<i>I didn't know him.</i>

45:14.837 --> 45:16.547
He just came out of nowhere.

45:17.673 --> 45:19.258
He saved my life.

45:20.676 --> 45:22.261
Like a guardian angel.

45:30.728 --> 45:32.271
<i>I heard that girl screaming</i>

45:32.438 --> 45:33.940
and then I heard
tires squealing,

45:34.023 --> 45:36.108
a whole bunch of shots
and then a crash.

45:36.317 --> 45:37.944
What about the shooter?

45:38.236 --> 45:39.528
He looked like a white dude.

45:40.863 --> 45:42.365
He had a hoodie.

45:42.615 --> 45:45.117
It's the same description
the couple gave outside.

45:45.284 --> 45:46.577
White guy in a hoodie.

45:46.661 --> 45:48.579
They called him
a guardian angel.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.790
Yeah, more like
a Grim Reaper.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.250
I mean, did you see how

45:52.333 --> 45:54.001
he stood over that guy
and shot him?

45:54.168 --> 45:55.753
That shit was cold.

45:56.003 --> 45:57.463
Did you see his face?

45:57.880 --> 45:58.923
Mmm-mmm.

45:59.090 --> 46:02.218
How about marks
on his arms or tattoos?

46:02.635 --> 46:03.636
Mmm-mmm.

46:04.011 --> 46:06.222
So nothing
that can help us?

46:06.889 --> 46:09.475
It was dark.
He was shooting.

46:09.850 --> 46:10.851
Um...

46:11.394 --> 46:13.437
He kept waving his hand
around like this.

46:13.604 --> 46:14.814
Like his hand got shot?

46:14.981 --> 46:17.400
I don't know.
Watch the video.

46:17.692 --> 46:19.610
I mean, you've seen
as much as I did.

46:21.487 --> 46:22.947
- There!
- Yeah.

46:24.073 --> 46:25.199
It doesn't look like
it was shot.

46:25.283 --> 46:26.284
Hmm.

46:29.829 --> 46:31.831
No, that is the slide
kicking back

46:31.998 --> 46:33.624
and cutting his hand

46:33.791 --> 46:35.543
because he doesn't know
how to hold a gun.

46:35.710 --> 46:38.170
So we're looking for a guy
who never fired a gun?

46:38.337 --> 46:40.089
Well, not in anger.

46:40.840 --> 46:42.925
Well, he has now.

46:43.092 --> 46:45.094
Natasha, listen,
we're gonna need you to

46:45.177 --> 46:46.929
keep this video
confidential, okay?

46:47.138 --> 46:48.723
No posting on social media,

46:48.806 --> 46:50.182
and all that stuff
you guys do.

46:50.349 --> 46:52.310
I uploaded
that shit hours ago.

46:52.393 --> 46:53.811
I'm getting hits
like a motherfucker.

46:54.562 --> 46:55.938
Terrific.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.819
Who wants gluten?

47:01.902 --> 47:04.030
Oh, man, that's just cruel.

47:04.113 --> 47:05.114
A little support.

47:05.281 --> 47:06.365
You know
you want a bear claw.

47:06.532 --> 47:07.533
RAINESI Hell, yeah, I do.

47:07.700 --> 47:08.701
Donut hole.

earlier today,

49:18.789 --> 49:20.332
but you should check on him.

49:21.459 --> 49:22.710
I'll check that.

49:24.962 --> 49:28.007
This poor kid.
Got shot on the way to school.

49:30.134 --> 49:31.135
Tyler.

49:31.218 --> 49:32.219
Mmm-hmm.

49:33.012 --> 49:35.556
Hi, Tyler. I'm Dr. Kersey.

49:36.474 --> 49:38.642
I'm here to look at your wound.
ls that all right?

49:42.480 --> 49:45.774
I have my little
flashlight pen.

49:46.734 --> 49:48.068
Let's take a look.

49:51.739 --> 49:52.990
That must've hurt.

49:55.367 --> 49:57.369
A LeBron fan?

49:59.872 --> 50:00.873
<i>Me'?</i>

50:01.081 --> 50:03.083
I'll always be a Jordan guy.

50:03.709 --> 50:09.215
He had swagger, he had style,
he could fly through the air.

50:09.798 --> 50:14.178
Still, LeBron might be
the best ever.

50:14.678 --> 50:16.180
Maybe.
Yeah.

50:18.265 --> 50:20.100
You got caught
in some crossfire?

50:22.269 --> 50:24.146
The Ice Cream Man done it.

50:24.438 --> 50:26.190
The Ice Cream Man?

50:26.398 --> 50:28.609
Can't walk to school
if you don't work for him.

50:29.068 --> 50:30.236
Selling ice cream?

50:32.363 --> 50:33.405
Nah.

50:35.866 --> 50:38.827
He said next time,
it ain't gonna be my leg.

50:46.001 --> 50:50.047
Tyler, you are
gonna be all right.

50:50.339 --> 50:52.174
I promise.

Thanks.

50:54.593 --> 50:56.887

50:57.388 --> 50:58.389
Okay.

51:16.949 --> 51:19.201

Word?

51:19.410 --> 51:22.204
Yo, that's it, MUBU.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.624
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Yeah, Tanisha.

51:28.377 --> 51:30.588
That was next level business
she was doing.

51:32.673 --> 51:34.425
Pimp out your crib?
That's it.

51:34.592 --> 51:36.635
That's what I'm talking about.
Thank you.

51:36.802 --> 51:38.554
Yeah, so,
brought her up to my crib,

51:38.637 --> 51:39.763
show him the picture...

51:39.930 --> 51:41.098
Of course I got mine,

51:41.181 --> 51:42.516
but show him the picture,
youWlsee.

51:42.766 --> 51:45.894
- Let's see that cat, man.
- Hey, look here.

51:48.022 --> 51:50.190
You're the Ice Cream Man?

51:52.568 --> 51:54.320
Who the fuck are you?

51:54.528 --> 51:55.863
Your last customer.

51:55.946 --> 51:56.989
Oh, shit!

52:04.496 --> 52:06.915
- Yo, give me that shit!
- Out my way.

52:08.584 --> 52:09.585
He was white.

52:09.668 --> 52:11.003
A white guy,
he had a hoodie...

52:11.253 --> 52:12.921
And that's all I know.

52:13.088 --> 52:14.632
Was he tall? Short?
Thanks.

52:14.798 --> 52:17.468
- He was not short.
- Fat? Skinny?

52:17.635 --> 52:19.470
He was taller
than me, you know.

52:19.553 --> 52:21.138
I don't know.
He just went over there...

52:21.347 --> 52:22.389
He was just some white guy.

52:22.473 --> 52:23.641
Let me guess,
white guy with a hoodie?

52:23.807 --> 52:25.142
Yeah, exactly.
White guy with a hoodie.

52:25.351 --> 52:28.270
Fucking bullshit.
Nine witnesses, one story.

52:28.479 --> 52:30.064
The Grim Reaper.

52:30.147 --> 52:31.440
They say
he didn't take anything.

52:31.523 --> 52:33.609
Just walked up,
shot the victim and left.

52:34.276 --> 52:36.111
That's Ray Shawn Core.

52:36.278 --> 52:38.530
Multiple drug offenses suspect
and three shootings.

52:38.739 --> 52:40.741
Mmm, real community leader.
Yeah.

52:42.743 --> 52:45.162
You really think
it's the same shooter?

52:47.539 --> 52:49.625
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

52:49.708 --> 52:51.835
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

52:54.380 --> 52:55.714
Pull up that video.

52:56.548 --> 52:58.550
Reaper?
Yeah.

53:00.427 --> 53:03.013
What hand does he shoot with?
Hold up.

53:11.146 --> 53:14.066
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

<i>Don't we need people

<i>to keep the monsters at bay?</i>

54:17.921 --> 54:19.089

I'm getting calls

54:35.481 --> 54:38.817
Everybody's nervous about
a copycat. Where are we?

54:38.984 --> 54:41.779
Well, we assume
the carjacking was random.

54:41.862 --> 54:42.905
Mmm-hmm.

54:42.988 --> 54:45.449
And our subject was just in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

54:45.657 --> 54:47.659
But he got a taste for it.
Mmm-hmm.

54:47.743 --> 54:49.536
So we were trying
to figure out

54:49.620 --> 54:51.288
how he selected
the second victim.

54:51.497 --> 54:53.248
The drug dealer.
Mmm-hmm.

54:53.415 --> 54:54.875
Oh, we also know
he's left-handed.

54:55.709 --> 54:58.128
Um, and we're pretty sure
he's not in the system.

54:58.337 --> 55:00.756
We figured that out
after the first shooting.

55:00.964 --> 55:04.384
Um, he had
a lack of basic weapon skills.

55:04.468 --> 55:05.719
To say the least.

55:05.928 --> 55:06.970
Wow. Great.

55:07.054 --> 55:10.349
You got it narrowed down
to about a million suspects.

55:10.516 --> 55:13.185
Detectives,
get off your fucking asses!

55:17.147 --> 55:18.148
He's pissed.

55:23.153 --> 55:25.447
You wanna tell me where
we're gonna start looking

55:25.614 --> 55:27.825
for our white needle
in the haystack?

55:27.991 --> 55:29.326
Not where.

55:30.369 --> 55:31.370
But when.

55:32.538 --> 55:33.539
I mean, why now?

55:34.623 --> 55:35.624
What, uh...

55:35.999 --> 55:39.670
Lit the fuse
that set off our Mr. Reaper?

55:40.504 --> 55:42.172
You look much better.

55:43.590 --> 55:45.884
Thank you.
I feel much better.

55:46.051 --> 55:47.386
You exercising?

55:48.387 --> 55:49.763
I do my push-ups.

55:49.888 --> 55:53.308
Mmm-hmm. Good.
Getting out? Socializing?

55:53.934 --> 55:54.935
Mmm...

55:55.686 --> 55:56.937
Not so much.

55:57.020 --> 55:59.648
It's like you said.
It's a process.

56:00.315 --> 56:01.316
Takes time.

56:01.692 --> 56:03.569
Well, whatever you're doing,
keep it up.

56:03.652 --> 56:05.904
Okay. I Will.

56:12.286 --> 56:14.162
Keep on bagging. Push the O-neg.
Got it!

56:14.329 --> 56:15.372
Give me
the ultrasound machine.

56:15.539 --> 56:18.250
Hold compressions.
Give me the defib.

56:18.417 --> 56:19.751
Charge to 300.

56:19.918 --> 56:22.754
Jesus. I know this kid.

56:25.507 --> 56:27.676
Charged.
Clear.

56:28.802 --> 56:31.346
Continue bagging.
Charge again to 300.

56:35.309 --> 56:36.393
<i>Charged.</i>

56:36.935 --> 56:37.936
Clear.

56:43.942 --> 56:46.153
Time of death, 9:35 p.m.

57:47.172 --> 57:48.382
Dr. Kersey?

57:49.716 --> 57:50.717
Dr. Kersey?

58:11.196 --> 58:13.657
Wednesday, 8:00, La Fonda.

58:14.241 --> 58:15.283
See you guys.

58:30.257 --> 58:31.925
<i>Hi.
This is Detective Kevin Raines</i>

58:32.009 --> 58:33.927
<i>of the Chicago
Police Department.</i>

58:34.136 --> 58:36.596
<i>If this is an emergency,
please dial 911.</i>

59:05.500 --> 59:06.543
What?

59:06.918 --> 59:08.420
You scared the shit out of me.

59:09.921 --> 59:10.964
What are you doing here?

59:12.090 --> 59:14.259
What do you mean?
I can't check on my niece?

59:14.426 --> 59:16.970
And her dad
who doesn't return my texts?

59:17.137 --> 59:20.098
Yeah, yeah. Look, I'm sorry,
it's been a crazy week.

59:20.307 --> 59:21.850
Yeah? Still getting
used to being back.

59:22.768 --> 59:25.187
You sleeping better? 'Cause I gotta
tell you, you still look like shit.

59:25.353 --> 59:27.230
Thanks for your diagnosis,
Dr. Frank Kersey.

59:27.439 --> 59:29.191
Go fuck yourself. Jesus.

59:29.399 --> 59:31.193
Come on, let's go get a bite.
I'm buyin'.

59:31.359 --> 59:33.403
What, now?
Hey, I'm back to work.

59:33.612 --> 59:35.614
Union wages, no less. Come on.

59:36.782 --> 59:38.241
Ah, no, no, I can't.

59:38.325 --> 59:41.036
I got a meeting with
a bunch of hospital staff.

59:41.203 --> 59:43.580
All right.
What about this weekend?

59:43.747 --> 59:46.124
We go get a bite. Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah, that's better.

59:46.208 --> 59:48.085
That's better. I'll call
you later, all right?

59:48.668 --> 59:49.836
What's up with your hand here?

59:49.920 --> 59:51.755
It's nothing, it's a scratch.
Leave it alone.

59:51.963 --> 59:54.132
Look, do you need somethin'?

59:54.466 --> 59:56.968
Some cash? What, some help?

59:57.552 --> 59:58.845
Is that what this is about?

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.518
No.
Frank.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:06.144
Here, it's all right.

01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:08.355
Look, this is the $2,000
lowed you. Here you go.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:10.816
It's all right. I wanted to maybe
take you to lunch, you know.

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:14.986
Celebrate that I can
actually pay you back.

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:16.404
It's all right.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.449
- Frank.
- Later, man.

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:22.577
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:21.845
Hey, hey, buddy,
you can't be back here.

01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:24.431
I'm looking for Trebol.

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:27.309
Well, you found him,
now you can get out.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:31.563
Miguel sent me.

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:33.857
Who the fuck is Miguel?

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.445
He works as a valet
at my restaurant.

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:42.991
He's got an MJ tattooed
on his wrist.

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:49.247
He said you could help me
find a gift for my wife.

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:51.625
He works for you?

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.460
Yes.

01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:55.253
At your restaurant?

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:57.047
Yes.

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:00.050
Yeah, all right. Sit down.

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:05.889
Hey.

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:30.914
So, uh...

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:34.626
ls this a "thanks for
the years of service"

01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:35.710
kind of thing, honey,

01:02:35.794 --> 01:02:36.920
or is this more of

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:38.797
a "sorry, I boned
the babysitter" kind of thing?

01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:39.965
Neither.

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:57.524
So you're looking
for something...

01:02:58.984 --> 01:02:59.985
Specific?

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:03.446
Very specific.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.240
Well, how specific
are we talking?

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:09.828
Panerai watches.
You got any of those?

01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:11.830
Well, why don't you just
let me check

01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:13.164
the reserve collection
over here,

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:14.541
because I think
there's something here

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:15.917
that might interest you.

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:22.090
Drop it.

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:24.926
Fuck! It's dropped.
Kick it away.

01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:29.639
I want my stuff.

01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:32.517
It's in the back.

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:33.685
Keep moving.

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:35.895
Who's Fish?

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:37.063
He's just a drop guy.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:40.900
Yeah. Your crew that stole
the shit out of my house!

01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:43.653
You just described
half the shit in my shop, man.

01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:45.113
And you killed my wife!

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.323
Look.

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:48.700
Who are they?
I just know Fish, okay?

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:51.328
I don't know the other guys.
I told you!

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:54.497
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
It's all here. It's all here.

01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:57.751
I don't organize it by house, just
take whatevefls yours, all right?

01:03:57.917 --> 01:04:00.045
What, are you gonna talk? Or are you
gonna tell me where my shit is?

01:04:00.211 --> 01:04:01.212
It's here.

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:02.839
Where is it? I'm gonna blow
your fucking head off

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:03.965
if you don't tell me...

01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:07.010
What the... What is this?
What is this bullshit?

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.721
Now you're gonna tell me
where it is

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:11.765
in the next three seconds
or your head comes off.

01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:13.892
All right. It's all there.

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.439
You see this?
You know what it is, don't ya?

01:04:20.231 --> 01:04:22.275
It was on my wife's arm.

01:04:24.235 --> 01:04:25.904
I hope it was worth it,
asshole.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.248
If I knew...

01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:39.125
If I knew it was your shit,
I wouldn't have taken it, man.

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:42.337
All my love for my wife
and my family is keeping me

01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:44.214
from putting one
right in your fucking mouth.

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:46.925
I'm not a killer, okay?
I don't kill people.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:48.843
It's not what I do.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:54.391
Fuck!

01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:10.740
Motherfucker!

01:05:19.624 --> 01:05:21.209
Shit!

01:05:27.298 --> 01:05:28.299
Fuck!

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:35.849
Oh, shit!

01:05:53.825 --> 01:05:55.952
Fuck!

01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:02.167
Fuck!

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:05.378
Shit!

01:06:07.839 --> 01:06:10.133
I didn't shoot her.
I didn't shoot her.

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:12.051
I promise, I didn't shoot her.

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:16.723
Fuck!

01:06:17.015 --> 01:06:19.017
Who did?
It wasn't me.

01:06:21.352 --> 01:06:24.063
Fuck! Please!

01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:26.149
It wasn't me. It's Joe.
What?

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:27.358
Joe!
Joe who?

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:30.778
Joe Gannon! The fat greasy
fuck at the auto body shop.

01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:32.822
Where's Joe?
It's in my phone.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:35.074
It's got pictures, everything.
I'll bring you to him.

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:50.507
Stupid motherfuck.

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:12.237
<i>Watch what
I do in the next few seconds.</i>

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.404
<i>You might learn something</i>

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:15.490
<i>that could help you
solve your problem.</i>

01:07:15.573 --> 01:07:16.824
<i>Grab this drill.</i>

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.369
<i>I'm going to drill
several holes</i>

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:20.954
<i>around this circle right here.</i>

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:23.164
<i>And when I do that,</i>

01:07:23.248 --> 01:07:26.626
<i>the information that's inside
of this metal box</i>

01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:29.420

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.427
<i>With any luck, your metal box</i>

01:07:36.511 --> 01:07:37.804
<i>should now look
something like this.</i>

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:45.061
<i>Again, FBI, CIA,
NSA, Interpol,</i>

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:48.398

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:50.608
<i>Stay out of trouble,

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:06.207
Morning, Paul!

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:13.339
<i>Reaper alert!</i>

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:14.716
<i>Reaper alert! Reaper alert!</i>

01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:17.135
Where's the <i>Reaper?</i>

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:18.761
The Grim Reaper strikes again.

01:08:18.845 --> 01:08:20.263
This time
in the Pilsen neighborhood.

01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:22.055
In front of this liquor store,

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.143
which was a fencing operation
for stolen goods.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.228
Not anymore,
when last night,

01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:29.647
the Grim Reaper
paid them a visit.

01:08:29.731 --> 01:08:32.399
Dude, I look over, I see this dude
walking out, this old white dude,

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:35.278
and he's walking with his hood
up, looking super suspioious.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.154
Just like, you know...

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.032
Kind of idolizing him.
Man, right now,

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:40.450
this dude is all over
the Internet, man.

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:42.827
There's memes coming up.
Get outta here.

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:44.453
Yeah, there's memes.
Like, people are making memes.

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:45.830
Look at this one right here.

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:47.624
Oh, that's too intense.

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:48.791
He's become a folk hero.

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:50.251
He's a real hero
to these people.

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:51.336
They're being affected

01:08:51.419 --> 01:08:52.420
by all this crime
in their neighborhood.

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:54.171
As long as it's not
in your neighborhood.

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:56.215
Clearly, if he didn't
just kill somebody,

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:57.300
I don't know what he did.

01:08:57.508 --> 01:08:59.676
I still stand by
my point that

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:02.013
we're normalizing
dangerous behavior.

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:04.474
You know? Should we be
policing ourselves

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:05.558
in our own neighborhoods...

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:08.478
I have said we need a guy
like Grim Reaper for years.

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:11.104
Are you Team Reaper or not?

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:12.774
<i>Give us</i> a call.
<i>Sway in the Morning</i>

01:09:12.857 --> 01:09:15.193
at Shade 45, Sirius XM.

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:35.796
Dr. Kersey, it's
Detective Raines and Jackson.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.465
May we come in?

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:39.175
Of course. Come on in.

01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:43.638
How you doing?
Sorry to drop in like this.

01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:44.971
Oh, no.

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:47.100
Uh, something's
come to our attention.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:49.352
We were hoping you could
offer some insight.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:51.354
I'm happy to see you guys.
Have a seat.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.189
Thanks.
Thank you.

01:09:54.232 --> 01:09:55.983
Okay, um...

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:58.778
Have you ever seen this man?

01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:03.574
No.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:05.868
Is he a suspect?

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:09.622
Well, his name is Tate Karp.
He goes by "The Fish."

01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:12.208
He's a career burglar and,
we believe,

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:14.377
involved in
your wife's shooting.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.379
How did you find him?

01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:18.214
What did he say?

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:21.259
Well, unfortunately,
he was killed last night

01:10:21.426 --> 01:10:23.261
before we had a chance
to question him.

01:10:24.762 --> 01:10:28.307
But we did find this ring
at the crime scene.

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:34.355
That's my ring.

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:37.150
Yeah. That's what we thought.

01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:39.944
Um, but this right here,

01:10:40.027 --> 01:10:41.529
it's the break
we've been waiting for.

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:44.615
- It's great.
- Yeah.

01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:46.993
Now that we have Karp,
it's just a matter of time

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.703
before we have
the rest of 'em.

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:51.205
We'll run through his priors,
see who he liked to work with,

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.499
subpoena his cell phone
records, his texts.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.209
Even the phone's GPS.

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:59.589
Great. Do you need
anything else from me?

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:02.633
Appreciate that.
I think we're good for now.

01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:05.219
Um... I know you've been
frustrated and I wanted to

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:07.513
come by in person
to give you the good news.

01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:10.808
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:13.436
I told you to have faith.

01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:15.062
Thanks for your time.

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:16.355
Thank you.

01:12:14.705 --> 01:12:17.166
Yo, we're closed, pal.

01:12:18.042 --> 01:12:19.544
You're Joey, right?

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:24.507
Yeah. Who the fuck are you?

01:12:29.804 --> 01:12:32.306
Hey, fuckstick,
I said we were closed.

01:12:57.456 --> 01:13:00.418
What the fuck?
Get me the fuck outta here.

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.007
Fuck! Get me the fuck
outta here, man!

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:07.633
What the fuck are you...
Shut the fuck up.

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:11.220
You're gonna tell me
what I wanna hear.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.561
You don't want this.
But guess what?

01:13:19.478 --> 01:13:20.897
You'll get some.

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:23.524
I'm just gonna help you out.

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:27.737
Trust me, I know where to cut.

01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:30.907
Now right back here,
don't move...

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.618
...is your sciatic nerve.

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:41.292
Longest, strongest nerve
in the body.

01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:44.503
Fuck!

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:47.673
God damn!

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:51.469
You're that doctor.

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:53.429
lam that doctor.

01:13:53.512 --> 01:13:55.139
But right now,
I'm your doctor.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:58.017
Your friend, Fish,
is already dead.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.061
You can thank him
for giving you up.

01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:03.230
No. No, no, no, no.

01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:07.735
What I want to know
is who else was there.

01:14:07.902 --> 01:14:08.945
Nobody.

01:14:09.028 --> 01:14:10.071
Who else was there?

01:14:10.237 --> 01:14:11.238
No one, man.

01:14:17.161 --> 01:14:20.748
What you're feeling
is a caustic agent

01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:23.501
being applied directly
to a nerve.

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:28.130
In med school,
we were taught that

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:29.924
this is the most
painful experience

01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:31.175
that a person can endure

01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:33.469
without possibly going into
cardiac arrest.

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:35.888
Please stop. It hurts.

01:14:36.055 --> 01:14:37.765
The bad news is

01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:40.309
you've got a shit ton
of brake fluid here.

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:42.478
So we might be here all night.

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.272
Now you're gonna
start talking, aren't ya?

01:14:46.273 --> 01:14:48.943
Knox! That's his name. Knox!

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:50.945
Knox. What's his full name?

01:14:51.112 --> 01:14:52.780
I don't know
anything else, man!

01:14:52.863 --> 01:14:55.116
His name is Knox
and he's from the South Side.

01:14:55.282 --> 01:14:56.993
Look, Fish planned
the whole fucking thing!

01:14:57.076 --> 01:14:58.661
I never met the guy before!

01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:00.454
Where do I find Knox?

01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:03.040
You don't. He finds you.

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:05.251
Joe.
I don't know anything else!

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:07.336
I swear to fucking God!

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.797
I have no reason
to protect this asshole!

01:15:09.964 --> 01:15:13.884
I don't even fucking know him!
You gotta believe me, please.

01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:16.303
I fucking swear it!

01:15:17.263 --> 01:15:18.848
I believe you, Joe.

01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:23.436
I think you're gonna find
the propofol is wearing off.

01:15:25.771 --> 01:15:26.814
Thanks for your help.

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:37.033
Fuck.

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:42.079
So you're not gonna kill me?

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:43.247
No.

01:15:44.165 --> 01:15:45.416
The jack is.

01:15:53.007 --> 01:15:55.468
Damn. Hell of a swing.

01:15:55.676 --> 01:15:57.178
Lefty, no less.

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:58.554
Hey, Frank.

01:15:58.888 --> 01:16:00.473
You know,
when I asked your supervisor

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.433
where you like to
hang out after work,

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.060
he told me here.

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:05.227
I thought he was
jerking my chain.

01:16:06.604 --> 01:16:08.522
Then I looked you up.

01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:11.192
You were
a legitimate prospect.

01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:12.359
What happened?

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:14.320
So you want my autograph?

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:16.072
We just wanna talk.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.448
All right.

01:16:17.615 --> 01:16:20.367
Have you heard of this
Grim Reaper fellow

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:21.577
that people are talking about?

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:22.870
Yeah, yeah.
I heard about it.

01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:27.208
Well, last night,
he went into a liquor store.

01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:29.627
And he killed
one of the three men

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:30.961
that broke into
your brother's house.

01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:34.632
Traffic cam caught him walking
in and out. White, fit...

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:36.842
Lefty.
Lefty. Yeah. He's a lefty.

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:39.762
So I ask myself, you know,

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:42.598
"What streetwise lefty
do I know?"

01:16:42.807 --> 01:16:44.141
You know,
the kind of guy that could

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:46.936
put word out
he would pay for info.

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:49.605
Would want to
execute our suspects.

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:53.025
A real do-it-himself
kind of guy.

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:56.028
So you think I had something
to do with it, huh?

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:58.030
Well, you should talk
to my brother.

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:00.658
He'll tell you
that I don't pay for shit.

01:17:01.408 --> 01:17:05.329
Of course. So, do you mind
if we see your hands?

01:17:13.546 --> 01:17:15.631
Hey!

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.927
<i>Tragedy struck earlier this
evening in West Englewood,</i>

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:21.178
<i>where police think</i>

01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:23.597
a <i>49-year-old father of three
was killed</i>

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:26.433
<i>while trying to commit
vigilante justice.</i>

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:28.102
<i>Police believe
this was a copycat</i>

01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:30.229
<i>of the so-called
"Chicago Grim Reaper."</i>

01:17:30.437 --> 01:17:32.398
<i>A guy who went out,

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:34.400
<i>and ended up a victim himself.</i>

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:36.026
<i>Police are still looking
for the shooter.</i>

01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:02.970
This is Paul Kersey.

01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:05.681
<i>I hear
you're looking for me.</i>

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:06.974
That's right.

01:18:07.141 --> 01:18:10.144
<i>Come to Blowout.
Last club off Ashland.</i>

01:18:10.227 --> 01:18:11.353
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

01:18:11.562 --> 01:18:13.063
Why would I do that?

01:18:13.272 --> 01:18:15.482
<i>Because it's safe. Public.</i>

01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:18.694
<i>And I wanna tell you what
your wife's last words were.</i>

01:18:18.903 --> 01:18:20.946
<i>You have 30 minutes.</i>

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:38.297
Come on, <i>Paul.</i>

01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:42.635
Paul, come on, man.

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:45.721
We gotta talk, Paul.

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:51.560
Hey, man.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:54.021
Are you here?

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:03.739
Hey, man.

01:19:21.215 --> 01:19:22.216
Paul.

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:55.768
Get out.

01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:58.414
Jackson.

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:02.334
What?
We're on our way.

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:04.586
Shooting at a club downtown.

01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:06.588
Guy in a hoodie
pulled out a gun,

01:22:06.797 --> 01:22:09.341
then got shot himself.
Ran out in the crowd.

01:22:09.508 --> 01:22:11.301
Hey. Alert all the
local hospitals, all right?

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:13.345
Any gunshot wound
being treated,

01:22:13.429 --> 01:22:15.264
a male, 40s or 50s,
give us a call!

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:22.062
<i>County reports
they have no one</i>

01:22:22.146 --> 01:22:23.480
<i>matching the shooter's
description.</i>

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:26.483
<i>One of the victims
is en route to Chicago North.</i>

01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:28.068
<i>He says he saw the shooter.</i>

01:22:41.748 --> 01:22:43.459
The patient's this way.

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:52.176
How you doing?

01:22:52.759 --> 01:22:54.178
Did you see the shooter?

01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:56.430
Yeah, Idid.

01:22:56.763 --> 01:22:59.224
Can you describe him to us?

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:39.348
Fuck!

01:24:11.421 --> 01:24:12.714
- Open it.
- Uh-huh.

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:34.820
Paul, what you gonna do?
Shoot me too?

01:24:34.987 --> 01:24:36.029
What are you doing here?

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:37.864
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

01:24:37.948 --> 01:24:38.949
What is this,
your little war room?

01:24:39.032 --> 01:24:40.033
Don't you judge me!

01:24:40.117 --> 01:24:42.911
I'm notjudging you!
I'm worried about you!

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:45.414
You... You can't do this.

01:24:45.956 --> 01:24:47.332
Paul, you're not a cop.

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:49.042
Then somebody has to do it!

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:53.171
My wife and daughter
just disappear.

01:24:53.839 --> 01:24:55.799
And there's no consequences.

01:24:59.052 --> 01:25:01.013
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:02.848
Everything.

01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:06.852
I worked hard.
I obeyed the law.

01:25:07.894 --> 01:25:12.316
I made a life for my family.
For my wife and daughter!

01:25:12.482 --> 01:25:14.192
And what?
Just forget about that?

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:16.194
They're just gone now?

01:25:19.364 --> 01:25:21.283
You need to leave now, Frank.

01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:23.076
I don't want you
to be part of this.

01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:26.747
No. Hey, hey.
I'm already a part of this.

01:25:38.175 --> 01:25:39.176
Stay, Sta)'-

01:25:46.767 --> 01:25:49.269
If it isn't Chicago's finest.

01:25:49.936 --> 01:25:51.647
Hello, Frank.

01:25:52.105 --> 01:25:53.607
We were expecting
your brother.

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:57.110
Yeah, he's out. Dinner party.
Why, what's up?

01:25:57.736 --> 01:26:00.197
Well, he could be
in real trouble.

01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:04.201
Believe or not,
we wanna help.

01:26:04.368 --> 01:26:08.330
That's so sweet. I appreciate
your concern, Detective.

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:11.333
Like I said, when I see him,
I'll tell him.

01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:14.961
That was some bullshit.

01:26:16.922 --> 01:26:18.256
He's in there.

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:21.593
But we're not
arresting the surgeon

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:23.512
without an ironclad proof.

01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:30.936
Well, the good news is
I'm not a suspect anymore.

01:26:31.103 --> 01:26:34.231
The bad news is
I'm not a suspect anymore.

01:26:36.733 --> 01:26:38.276
Paul, this has to end.

01:26:39.319 --> 01:26:40.487
It's gotta end, man.

01:26:40.570 --> 01:26:42.406
I don't wanna have to bury you
next to your wife.

01:26:42.489 --> 01:26:44.157
You're not gonna bury me.

01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:46.535
All right.
We gotta figure this out

01:26:46.702 --> 01:26:48.161
if you think there's anything
the cops can find.

01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:50.789
There were cameras
in the club.

01:26:50.956 --> 01:26:52.833
I kept my head down
the whole time.

01:26:52.999 --> 01:26:54.292
Where's your car?

01:26:54.459 --> 01:26:55.502
Near the hospital.

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:57.379
Okay, you gotta get it,

01:26:57.462 --> 01:26:59.047
before the police
start checking tags.

01:26:59.256 --> 01:27:00.757
Okay.

01:27:00.841 --> 01:27:02.259
Who'd be calling
at 2:30 in the morning?

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:04.761
Let's see.

01:27:05.637 --> 01:27:06.763
It's the hospital.

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:09.349
Hello?

01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:13.895
Thank you.
I'll be right there.

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:16.606
It's Jordan. She's awake.

01:27:32.164 --> 01:27:33.415
On, baby.

01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:46.595
Daddy.

01:27:48.722 --> 01:27:50.348
Hi, Daddy.

01:27:51.141 --> 01:27:52.142
Baby.

01:27:55.353 --> 01:27:58.148
Dad, they won't tell me
where Mom is.

01:28:03.653 --> 01:28:06.406
Dad, they won't
tell me where Mom is.

01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:09.409
Dad, where is Mom?

01:28:10.911 --> 01:28:14.623
I wanna see Mom. Where is she?
Please, Dad, where is she?

01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:29.638
Oh, Jesus.

01:28:37.771 --> 01:28:38.772
Hey.

01:28:39.105 --> 01:28:40.440
How's she doing?

01:28:40.774 --> 01:28:42.734
Physically, I can take her
home in a week.

01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:46.321
Mentally, she just found out
her mother died.

01:28:46.404 --> 01:28:48.198
Jesus, Pauly.

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:52.035
It's a miracle though,
you know,

01:28:52.118 --> 01:28:53.912
that we got her back.
It's a miracle.

01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:56.665
It was a miracle.

01:28:57.332 --> 01:28:58.917
All that matters now
is that...

01:29:02.212 --> 01:29:03.797
You look after her.

01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:05.715
Yes, of course.

01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:08.260
You, though. Her father.

01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:09.469
I will.

01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:12.430
Not this other thing,
not this other guy. You.

01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:13.974
It's over.

01:29:16.935 --> 01:29:18.728
It's over.

01:29:19.396 --> 01:29:20.397
Okay.

01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:21.815
Slowly.
Thanks.

01:29:21.982 --> 01:29:22.983
You sure
you got everything?

01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:24.067
Yeah, I got it.

01:29:24.150 --> 01:29:25.151
You got her, Dad?

01:29:25.235 --> 01:29:26.319
I got it, Dad. I'm okay.

01:29:26.486 --> 01:29:29.197
All right, I know you got it.
Easy does it.

01:29:29.406 --> 01:29:30.824
I can't believe
I have to leave in this,

01:29:30.907 --> 01:29:32.158
feel like an invalid.

01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:33.869
You're not an invalid.

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:36.288
Bye, Jordan.
Bye.

01:29:36.454 --> 01:29:37.706
You ready?
Yes, take me home.

01:29:41.626 --> 01:29:43.378
Hey, Dr. Kersey.
Dr. Kersey.

01:29:43.545 --> 01:29:45.213
Jordan.
Jordan.

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:47.591
I told you guys,
we'll call you

01:29:47.674 --> 01:29:48.884
as soon as she
remembers something.

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:50.719
It's okay, Dad. Um...

01:29:51.469 --> 01:29:53.388
I wanna help you guys,
I really do.

01:29:53.471 --> 01:29:55.015
It's just that...

01:29:55.181 --> 01:29:56.391
I don't remember anything

01:29:56.474 --> 01:29:58.268
after going upstairs
to get the iPad.

01:29:58.602 --> 01:30:01.187
Any little detail
you can remember

01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:03.189
will really help us out
a lot, Jordan.

01:30:03.565 --> 01:30:06.192
I don't remember a thing.
I'm sorry.

01:30:06.359 --> 01:30:08.528
It's okay. Maybe over time,
you'll remember something.

01:30:08.737 --> 01:30:11.323
Either way, we'll keep looking
for the guys.

01:30:11.531 --> 01:30:12.866
Thank you.
Thanks, guys.

01:30:12.949 --> 01:30:14.367
Dr. Kersey.
We'll let you know.

01:30:14.451 --> 01:30:16.411
Bye.

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:18.455
<i>PA ANNOUNCER'. Dr. Meredith,</i>

01:30:18.538 --> 01:30:22.083
<i>Dr. Ronald Meredith,
please report...</i>

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:25.629
Well, they seem okay.

01:30:28.381 --> 01:30:29.674
Hey, hold that.

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:36.139
Thank you.

01:30:40.936 --> 01:30:42.729
What happened to you?

01:30:43.188 --> 01:30:46.232
Oh, um, I was in an accident.

01:30:46.483 --> 01:30:48.026
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:30:49.736 --> 01:30:51.821
Are you better?

01:30:52.072 --> 01:30:53.406
Yeah.

01:30:56.409 --> 01:30:57.744
That's nice.

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:02.415
You going home?

01:31:03.249 --> 01:31:06.211
Yeah. I'm going home.

01:31:07.671 --> 01:31:10.173
I'm going home, too.

01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:13.093
Well, what happened to you?

01:31:13.593 --> 01:31:15.595
Igotshot

01:31:18.014 --> 01:31:19.766
Oh, well...

01:31:20.016 --> 01:31:22.227
I'm glad you're okay.

01:31:22.894 --> 01:31:24.104
Thank you.

01:31:27.565 --> 01:31:28.692
Take care.

01:31:29.109 --> 01:31:31.820
I'll see you around,
Dr. Kersey.

01:31:32.612 --> 01:31:34.614
Dad, who was that?

01:31:34.864 --> 01:31:38.535
Not a clue, honey.
Somebody else's patient.

01:31:48.294 --> 01:31:50.296
Welcome to Jolly Roger's.
How can I help you?

01:31:50.714 --> 01:31:52.215
I wanna buy a gun.

01:31:52.757 --> 01:31:54.634
Don't I know you?

01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:01.558
Yeah, I'm taking
Writing and History.

01:32:01.641 --> 01:32:03.977
Mainly just
introduction classes.

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:05.979
I'm doing it online,
just a couple hours a day.

01:32:06.146 --> 01:32:07.313
So that way,
I don't fall behind

01:32:07.397 --> 01:32:08.523
when school starts next fall.

01:32:09.399 --> 01:32:10.567
Well, that's smart.

01:32:12.736 --> 01:32:15.447
You know, I think you're the
smartest one in the family.

01:32:16.322 --> 01:32:17.657
So how's your therapy coming?

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:19.826
'Cause you look like
you're getting around better.

01:32:19.993 --> 01:32:22.454
It's good. You know, boring.
I'm almost done,

01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:24.247
but I just had to
teach my body

01:32:24.330 --> 01:32:26.124
how to do basic things again.

01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:28.877
It feels good
to have you home.

01:32:29.878 --> 01:32:31.588
Feels good to be home.

01:32:38.178 --> 01:32:41.222
And that's him in the middle.
Him and the girl.

01:32:43.308 --> 01:32:44.601
Good night, Uncle Frank.
Love you!

01:32:44.768 --> 01:32:45.935
Okay, Frankie!

01:33:15.632 --> 01:33:17.926
Dad, the kitchen's clean.
I'm going to bed.

01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:21.513
Okay, honey.

01:33:25.225 --> 01:33:27.727
Hey, can you
help me with this?

01:33:28.228 --> 01:33:29.604
Move this?
Slide it down a little.

01:33:29.687 --> 01:33:30.688
Yeah, just a little bit.
Mmm-hmm.

01:33:30.772 --> 01:33:31.815
Why are you moving this?

01:33:31.898 --> 01:33:34.526
Because I need you
to come over here.

01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:36.152
I just saw somebody run by.

01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:38.029
What do you mean you just saw
someone run by?

01:33:38.196 --> 01:33:39.781
You saw someone run by here?
Yeah, I did. I did.

01:33:39.948 --> 01:33:41.533
I want you to
get under the stairs.

01:33:41.699 --> 01:33:42.992
Dad, why are you putting me
under the stairs?

01:33:43.159 --> 01:33:45.286
Call the cops right now.
Dad, please be careful.

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.038
Take your phone and dial 911.
Dad, please!

01:33:52.794 --> 01:33:54.337
<i>911,
what is your emergency?</i>

01:33:54.504 --> 01:33:55.713
There's men, they're
breaking into my house.

01:33:55.797 --> 01:33:56.881
They're on my front lawn.

01:33:56.965 --> 01:33:57.966
I think they're coming
to kill me.

01:33:58.049 --> 01:33:59.050
My name is Jordan Kersey.

01:33:59.217 --> 01:34:01.845
I'm at 20 Dorset Road
in Evanston.

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.346
I think they're here.

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:35.063
Jordan, I'm okay.

01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:36.731
Dad. Dad!

01:35:36.898 --> 01:35:40.276
Stay quiet.
Just wait for the police.

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:43.488
Do not come out.
Stay in there.

01:36:29.409 --> 01:36:31.035
Sit down.

01:36:31.202 --> 01:36:32.370
Dad?

01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:35.331
I think they just shot my dad.

01:36:35.498 --> 01:36:38.042
Dad! Dad!

01:36:38.251 --> 01:36:39.919
Jordan, just stay up there!

01:36:40.253 --> 01:36:42.213
Is that your little girl?

01:36:43.256 --> 01:36:45.550
Now, you ever hear someone
burn to death?

01:36:46.718 --> 01:36:48.261
You're in for a treat,
Dr. Kersey.

01:36:48.344 --> 01:36:49.595
Dad!

01:37:16.914 --> 01:37:19.667
So you're saying
you got both the cut

01:37:19.751 --> 01:37:22.253
on your hand
that's almost healed

01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:25.923
and the shot in the shoulder
tonight? That's your story.

01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:28.634
That's what happened.
That's my story.

01:37:28.718 --> 01:37:30.136
Hmm.

01:37:30.303 --> 01:37:33.890
And the paperwork
for the pistols and the rifle?

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:36.851
You can call
Jolly Roger's Sporting Goods.

01:37:36.934 --> 01:37:38.227
Ask for Bethany.

01:37:38.478 --> 01:37:41.147
And you bought these guns...

01:37:41.856 --> 01:37:43.858
The day my daughter came home.

01:37:45.026 --> 01:37:48.196
Just in case something like
this ever happened again.

01:37:49.322 --> 01:37:50.865
What about a Glock?

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:56.079
I had one for a while.
Decided to get rid of it.

01:37:57.163 --> 01:37:58.581
Gone for good?

01:37:59.957 --> 01:38:02.043
Yeah. Gone for good.

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:06.172
Well, I got everything I need.

01:38:07.131 --> 01:38:09.384
Seems pretty straightforward.
Knox came back,

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:11.636
'cause he thought
Jordan could ID him.

01:38:11.803 --> 01:38:14.514
And you defended your family
like any man would.

01:38:15.056 --> 01:38:16.307
Thank you.

01:38:18.309 --> 01:38:21.187
And Dr. Kersey,
stick to saving lives.

01:38:21.354 --> 01:38:22.647
You're good at it.

01:38:22.814 --> 01:38:23.815
I will.

01:38:23.981 --> 01:38:25.149
Thanks for everything.

01:38:42.166 --> 01:38:45.253
So, you satisfied?

01:38:46.087 --> 01:38:47.505
No.

01:38:53.678 --> 01:38:55.763
Now I'm satisfied.

01:39:11.612 --> 01:39:12.613
Sway in the Morning,

01:39:12.697 --> 01:39:13.906
<i>Shade 45 at Sirius XM.</i>

01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.991
<i>Hey, Grim Reaper,</i>

01:39:15.158 --> 01:39:16.617
<i>we don't know where you are,
where you went,</i>

01:39:16.701 --> 01:39:17.702
<i>or what happened to you,</i>

01:39:17.869 --> 01:39:20.246
<i>but wherever that is,
stay there. Peace.</i>

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:24.709
Have I told you
how proud I am of you?

01:39:24.876 --> 01:39:27.837
Yes, Dad, you've told me,
like, a billion times.

01:39:28.004 --> 01:39:30.423
If you ever need anything,
I'm just three stops away.

01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:33.050
I know, Dad.
I've got the number.

01:39:35.303 --> 01:39:36.596
I love you.

01:39:36.762 --> 01:39:38.306
I love you, honey.

01:39:41.476 --> 01:39:44.020
Well, you can go now.

01:39:44.103 --> 01:39:46.814
All right. Go be smart.

01:39:50.568 --> 01:39:51.611
Bye,baby.

01:40:06.417 --> 01:40:07.418
Hey!
