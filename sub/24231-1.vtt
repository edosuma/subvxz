Look at your lips. You wearing
my red lipstick. You think you grown?

00:55.388 --> 00:58.808

red lipstick besides me. Let's go.

That's right.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.950
Bro, I ain't battling no little girl.

01:58.660 --> 02:02.372
- You can't be serious.
- You asked for the Queensbridge champion.

02:02.705 --> 02:04.415
All right, who's going first?

02:05.291 --> 02:08.586
Remember, this is hip-hop, breaking,
MC-ing, graffiti and DJ-ing.

02:08.669 --> 02:12.757
Why do we do it? Peace, love, unity
and to safely have fun, all right?

02:12.841 --> 02:16.469
Now, let's get this battle started!

02:19.305 --> 02:20.890
My man got this.

02:20.974 --> 02:21.975
Can I curse?

02:22.142 --> 02:25.145
I don't care what you do
as long as you win that $50.

02:50.169 --> 02:53.047
It's the way I like it.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.594
Go, Fast. Go, Fast.

02:57.677 --> 02:58.845
Go, Fast.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.641
Stop, you're gonna cut me with your teeth.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.227
So what? I'm getting in my kisses.

03:09.522 --> 03:13.651
Shante. Come on. If you're gonna
do this, go take that in your room,

03:13.735 --> 03:17.947
and tell Latifa to come out here
and let's get dinner going. It's ready.

03:23.202 --> 03:24.203
Watch this.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.294
Shante, stop.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.504
Mommy want you.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.099
Mommy, I picked out my room.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.726
You did? Well, let me see.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.523
- I like this room with the window.
- Mm-hm.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.484
And I really, really, really want it.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.695
You have to fight that out with
your sisters. What do you think?

03:59.614 --> 04:01.074
You can have what you want.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.700
- Go wash your hands.
- Okay.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.038
Ho-oh!

04:07.121 --> 04:08.456
What's all this, baby?

04:08.539 --> 04:10.083
We're celebrating.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.209
Celebrating what?

04:11.876 --> 04:12.710
Life.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.171
- New beginnings, honey.
- All right.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.839
Alrighty, then. Come on.

04:19.676 --> 04:20.969
Tell me you love me.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.681
- You know how I feel...
- I wanna hear you say it.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.517
- Tell me you love me.
I'll tell you this.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.938
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.526
We're dancing.
Let me see what you got.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.653
Let me see if you still got it.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.365
All right, Fastima,
five more minutes.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.367
Can't be late your first day of school.

04:44.575 --> 04:45.952
Man, y'all are lucky.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.706
No.

04:49.914 --> 04:52.875
But it don't matter.
I'm happy we have a backyard,

04:52.959 --> 04:55.461
so she can stop playing
on dirty-ass mattresses.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.587
Yeah, that's true.

04:57.213 --> 04:58.423
Anyway...

04:58.673 --> 05:01.217

jelly bean jackets?

05:01.301 --> 05:03.553
- Mm-mm.
- Fresh to death.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.929
I gotta get me one.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.681
Yeah, and the jeans, too.

05:06.764 --> 05:10.018
So, when you, uh, grab yours,
make sure you grab me one, too.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.938
Well, you ain't shit, Shante.

05:14.939 --> 05:15.982
Excuse you?

05:16.649 --> 05:18.735
I ain't battling you again, Ronald.

05:18.818 --> 05:22.447
Yeah, she already dusted your ass,
you need to kill that noise.

05:22.530 --> 05:25.408
- Nobody talking to your big-head ass.
Watch your mouth.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.452
I'm the dopest rapper in the Bridge.

05:27.535 --> 05:30.747
No, the world.
I've been practicing. I'm ready now.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.874
You need to practice some more.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.795
- All right, Fast. Time's up, come on.
- I got 50 I could beat you.

05:37.879 --> 05:41.966
Fifty She ain't took
a battle for less than 100 in years.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.469
- Get your broke ass out of here.
- Seventy-five.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.763
I don't have 100.

05:46.846 --> 05:50.349
You don't have a battle neither.
We Audi 5000, homeboy.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.268
Move.

05:55.104 --> 05:58.733
Y'all a bunch of ugly chicks.
Mad 'cause nobody wants y'all.

05:58.816 --> 06:01.069
Take them slanted eyes
back to the projects.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.321
Word up.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.492
Yeah, that's what I thought.

06:08.701 --> 06:09.827
Say something else.

06:11.996 --> 06:12.830
Come on.

06:15.666 --> 06:19.962
Good morning, class. We have
a new student joining us this semester.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.507
Welcome Ms. Lolita Gooden.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.675
Y'all can call me Shante.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.179
Young man.

06:29.055 --> 06:32.308
He already know he don't.

06:34.519 --> 06:37.313
So, tell us a little bit
about yourself, Shante.

06:38.689 --> 06:39.524
Uh...

06:40.441 --> 06:43.611
I'm from Queensbridge,
but I went to school in Woodside.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.823
Woodside? You know,
Woodside is a really good school.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.033
Not to say that 802 isn't. But it...

06:50.993 --> 06:52.578
Understand what I'm saying?

06:52.995 --> 06:56.707
Yeah. I had to transfer,
'cause I needed to be closer to home.

06:56.791 --> 07:00.044
My little sister started school,
and I gotta pick her up.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.796
You know, grown people stuff.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.256
Oh.

07:03.339 --> 07:07.135
All right. Uh, well, once again,
welcome to 802.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.595
You can have a seat.

07:11.764 --> 07:15.935
Now, I have strong rules.
One of them is keep your area clean.

07:19.188 --> 07:21.649
Don't lose it.
I'll hang it in my new room.

07:21.732 --> 07:25.194
- You gotta color inside the lines, Fast.
- Mommy said I don't.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.611
Mm.

08:08.571 --> 08:12.033
You know Gina's kids, Sharonda and Nicole?

08:12.617 --> 08:13.659
Ah.

08:15.119 --> 08:18.998
What do you think about bringing them
to that house we're gonna get?

08:21.584 --> 08:24.587
Yeah, baby. They could come.

08:24.670 --> 08:28.132
Because, baby. I mean,

08:28.633 --> 08:31.052
You always thinking about everybody else.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.264
But we ain't gonna be able

08:37.475 --> 08:38.893
I got something for you.

08:40.227 --> 08:41.770
And we gonna get that house.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.995
You have to open it and see.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.089

09:08.172 --> 09:10.216
I saved it.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.512
- Peggy.
- I saved a little bit every day.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.475
I will do anything for my babies.

You can't stop crime

You gonna get your ass hurt.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.115

You owe me more money.
You took all day.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.437
- I was gone five minutes.
- Five minutes too long.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.063
- We could've left him here.
- Mm.

12:13.315 --> 12:14.817

What do you want?

13:03.616 --> 13:04.867
I wanna come in.

13:06.076 --> 13:08.746
What time does this key lock my door?

13:10.831 --> 13:12.708
You wanna be playing with ho's,

13:12.791 --> 13:16.086

Hey, hey, hey. Come on, now, Peggy.

13:24.678 --> 13:25.638
Let her back in.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.181
No, Dave.

13:27.264 --> 13:31.435
If she wants to hang it on the streets,
let her stay her ass out there.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.354
My door locks at nine o'clock.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.314
And that goes for anybody.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.441
Peggy.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.653
That goes for anybody.

13:51.080 --> 13:51.914
Come on.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.378
- Thanks, Dave.
- Yeah.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.138
Fast.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.307

Dave will be here any second.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.249
We been ready.
- Hurry up.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.586
Mom, when we finished moving,
you gonna see me battle?

14:38.669 --> 14:42.798
I'll see you battle, but right now,
battle your ass to the front door.

14:42.882 --> 14:43.924
We gotta go.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.136
Girls. Girls. What are you doing?

14:47.219 --> 14:49.263
This is a happy day.
You should not be angry.

14:49.346 --> 14:53.475
I'm not angry, but do you ever close
your mouth? Give your mouth a break.

14:54.894 --> 14:55.728
Finally.

14:57.605 --> 14:58.606
What's up, y'all?

15:00.482 --> 15:02.818
I just came to see if y'all left yet.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.404
Not yet. But the truck's on its way.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.997
He was supposed to be here hours ago.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.919
You're not telling me
what I think you're telling me.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.712
I'm not telling you anything.

15:56.747 --> 15:57.581
Why?

16:00.042 --> 16:02.544
We gonna get it back. I promise.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.423
That was everything I have.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.469
Twenty thousand dollars.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.307
Why would he take that away
from my babies?

16:17.810 --> 16:21.271
You know how long it took me
to save that money?

16:21.939 --> 16:26.360
How many toilets I cleaned?
How many asses I wiped?

16:32.825 --> 16:33.867
Why, Gina?

16:39.289 --> 16:42.543
- Every time I try to leave...
- Here.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.921
Go ahead and have a drink.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.675
No, that ain't gonna get me out of here.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.261
It'll take your mind off it for now.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.592
Shante. Get your thumb out your mouth.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.096
Know how much I paid
for them braces?

17:36.180 --> 17:39.558
You gonna put your thumb
in your mouth and ruin your teeth?

17:40.768 --> 17:43.604
She the only one
in the projects with braces.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.149
Come here, little girl. Come here.

17:47.232 --> 17:50.277
- Let me see if they even work.
- All right, Ms. Peggy.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.821
- Shante, go.
- No. Let's see if they working.

17:52.905 --> 17:53.781
All right.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.742
Okay? It's okay.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.216
Ms. Peggy, it's okay.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.804
Girl, it's okay. You can let it out now.

18:16.887 --> 18:17.763
I'm all right.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.017
We gonna be fine.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.028
Move. Get off my bed.
I don't want you here.

18:33.112 --> 18:33.946

18:34.029 --> 18:35.239
- Move.

18:35.572 --> 18:38.075
- Move, little girl.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.717
Stop, that hurts.
You don't know how to comb my hair.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.052
Stop moving.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.055
Ow.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.016
Stop! I want Mommy to comb my hair!

19:03.100 --> 19:05.060
Mommy's sleep. We can't wake her.

19:05.435 --> 19:06.937
Stop!

19:08.105 --> 19:08.981
Go ahead.

19:16.405 --> 19:20.284
What you all doing? You two
should be out the door. Time for school.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.036
Come on, Neek. I need your help.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.330
Okay.

19:34.089 --> 19:35.591
Mommy, are you up?

19:38.093 --> 19:41.471
I need my hair combed.
Shante don't know what she doing.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.517

19:46.393 --> 19:47.644
Come on, wake up.

19:54.484 --> 19:56.069

19:56.528 --> 19:59.239
They really ain't shit.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.909
Did they even find him yet?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.160
He gone, Ranita.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.205
- Motherfucker.
You ain't shit, Shante.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.424
Gimme, gimme, gimme, all your little bank.

20:59.508 --> 21:03.470

21:05.764 --> 21:08.809
That's cool, but when you going

21:08.892 --> 21:10.352
I need some new clothes.

21:10.936 --> 21:11.770
You got dough?

22:25.218 --> 22:26.928
There was something in there.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.514
- Wasn't nothing in it.
- Show me.

22:30.348 --> 22:31.933
It wasn't nothing in there.

22:32.017 --> 22:35.145
Say something else
and see what happens to your ass.

22:38.356 --> 22:41.276
When was the last time
you took your ass to school?

22:45.030 --> 22:47.157
I don't want no fucking social worker

22:47.240 --> 22:50.660
showing up at my goddamn house anymore,
you understand me?

22:56.792 --> 23:00.462
I want better for you,
and I'm tired of this shit.

23:02.881 --> 23:06.635
And if you don't like it,
you can see your ass to my front door.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.346
I'm doing this for us, Mommy.

23:09.721 --> 23:10.639
We need money.

23:10.722 --> 23:14.392
I don't give a shit about no money.
I want you to go to school.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.357
You have 30 minutes.

23:20.690 --> 23:23.193
So, good luck, my young geniuses.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.281
Mr. Lester, I need a test.

23:30.075 --> 23:33.954
Oh. I forgot you were here, Ms. Gooden.

23:38.125 --> 23:41.419
How can you? You're never here.
Hallway, please, now.

23:42.963 --> 23:46.758
- Yeah, I know what a PINS warrant is.
- You must not know.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.345
They came up here looking for you.

23:50.762 --> 23:53.431
They asked me to turn you in
when I see you.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.351
So, what's up

23:58.603 --> 23:59.729
Nothing.

24:00.313 --> 24:05.944
Listen, I know the streets are calling,
but you must find a way to rise above it.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.780
And you know what? You can.

24:09.656 --> 24:12.159
Because you are
tremendously smart, Shante.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.249
Hey, Ms. Peggy.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.209

Because I said so.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.532
Hey, yo, y'all out here looking crazy.

24:53.033 --> 24:56.494

Yeah.

25:13.678 --> 25:14.804
Don't we look good

25:16.848 --> 25:18.016
All right, Shante.

25:38.411 --> 25:41.748
- If you need to go to the bathroom, go.
- I don't have to go.

25:41.831 --> 25:44.000
Fast, just go and use the bathroom.

25:44.084 --> 25:45.585
- I'll go with you.
- No.

25:46.002 --> 25:46.920
Come on, girl.

25:47.170 --> 25:48.964
Stop. I'm not going.

25:51.174 --> 25:52.676
Why don't you wanna go in?

25:56.179 --> 25:57.973
You scared you gonna miss him?

Come on. Spread out your dresses.

26:15.448 --> 26:18.576
Fast, come in the middle of us.
You can go right here.

26:18.660 --> 26:21.288
What she need to do
is just get in the house.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.712
Don't get it on my feet.

26:38.471 --> 26:39.556
Ah.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.441
I feel like a whole new woman.

26:53.194 --> 26:54.612
Just a damn shame.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.907
These babies learning
how to be disappointed by men

26:57.991 --> 26:59.284
at such an early age.

27:01.328 --> 27:03.330
It's gonna happen sooner or later.

27:06.750 --> 27:07.584
Shante!

27:14.424 --> 27:18.053
There's some beans and cornbread
on the stove if y'all hungry.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.231
Baby, just sit down.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.902
Or go on back to your place.
I'll look after them.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.688
I want y'all to take this as a lesson.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.902
You don't ever wait for no motherfucker.

28:18.613 --> 28:22.951
This is what happens when you think
they love you and you find out they don't.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.498
Trifling-ass motherfucker.

28:28.581 --> 28:31.918
Come on, Shante.
Come on inside and get something to eat.

28:36.881 --> 28:38.550
Give me my baby, Shante.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.724
Don't be giving me no attitude,
'cause I ain't him.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.922
No.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.885
You know what time my door closes.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.219
Mommy.

29:33.688 --> 29:36.232
Get on my fucking nerves, man.

29:36.649 --> 29:38.443
I'm out here fucking trying.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.913

29:50.914 --> 29:53.333
All right. For this, it's gonna be 500.

29:53.958 --> 29:56.711
Go on ahead and do that for 250.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.671
For six cashmere sweaters?

29:59.047 --> 30:01.883
- Mm-mm. It costs 1000 in-store.
- Two-fifty, Shante.

30:02.342 --> 30:05.261
It's only gonna take you 30 minutes,
there and back.

30:05.345 --> 30:08.097
Two hundred and 50 bills
for 30 minutes of work?

30:08.681 --> 30:09.891
You can't beat that.

30:24.656 --> 30:25.865
Miss

30:25.949 --> 30:27.367
Hey! Come back here!

30:52.016 --> 30:53.726
Fuck you! I'm done!

30:56.437 --> 30:58.857

Put your money in this, all right?
This what you put it in every week.

31:10.827 --> 31:15.331
And I'm serious about coming up

31:18.293 --> 31:19.127

31:21.337 --> 31:22.171
Thank you.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.132

That's why I'm inviting you into my spot.

31:30.179 --> 31:33.391

You still be boosting?

31:41.399 --> 31:43.693
Man, you old-school hustling.

You need to get down.

32:21.814 --> 32:22.649
Hey, yo.

32:33.117 --> 32:36.245
I got you. Use my cellular if you want.

32:40.625 --> 32:44.754
Dial the number and press the red button.

32:51.761 --> 32:53.930
<i>Hello?
Shante. Hey, where are you?</i>

32:56.766 --> 32:57.892
I can't tell you.

32:57.976 --> 33:01.312
How are things?

33:02.563 --> 33:05.274
I ain't coming back, Neek. Not to live.

33:07.110 --> 33:11.823
<i>- But I'm gonna bring some money, though.

Money for rent is in the jar.

35:26.624 --> 35:29.127
It's piling up,
waiting for you to take it.

35:29.210 --> 35:30.044
Let it pile.

All these dudes here. You can't be

What you mean? I always wear this.

37:06.515 --> 37:07.475

37:08.601 --> 37:12.021
What? Ever since I moved in here,
I wear the same pajamas.

You tell me one good reason why
I should let your ass back in my house.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.723
Because you my daughter?

39:31.786 --> 39:33.579
Y'all got any more clothes?

39:37.792 --> 39:40.336
I ain't picking that up.
What you think this is?

39:40.419 --> 39:43.464
I'm telling Mommy you ain't cleaning.

39:45.508 --> 39:47.468
How are you gonna make it out to tell her?

39:54.850 --> 39:56.519

- I ain't got time, I got laundry to do.
- One verse. It ain't gonna take long.

40:26.549 --> 40:30.761
I ain't got no money to give you.

40:31.178 --> 40:33.806
You still work

40:35.057 --> 40:38.519
I want jeans for me and my sisters.

You gotta put the headphones on

I'm about to play it back.

42:04.104 --> 42:07.525
Shante, where you going?
We gotta play it back and listen.

42:07.608 --> 42:10.569

<i>Oh, my God, Shante! Oh, my...!</i>

42:27.336 --> 42:29.880
<i>Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You're on the radio!</i>

42:30.339 --> 42:32.967
Stop calling.
You're gonna get me in trouble.

43:19.346 --> 43:21.223
I wonder what I sound like.

43:27.688 --> 43:31.108
You're Shante? We heard you on the radio.
You sounded dope.

43:31.191 --> 43:35.112
All right, back up, back up.
She's a superstar now.

43:35.195 --> 43:36.739
Okay. Come on.

43:36.822 --> 43:39.742
Move it, move it. Move.
No, she ain't signing.

43:40.326 --> 43:43.120
It's crazy how Shante
is all over the newspaper.

43:43.203 --> 43:44.997
Newspaper

43:45.331 --> 43:46.498
Oh, you don't know?

43:47.374 --> 43:48.876
Well, what happened now?

43:48.959 --> 43:52.963
I think she should tell you.

43:53.297 --> 43:56.634
Goddamn, Shante is always getting herself
into some mess.

43:57.426 --> 43:59.720
- Thank you.
- Don't have no kids, Raoul.

44:01.555 --> 44:02.389
Shante.

44:03.474 --> 44:06.602
I heard you was in the newspaper.
What did you do now?

44:06.685 --> 44:09.396
You can't keep yourself
out of trouble, can you?

44:17.071 --> 44:20.532
They been playing my song on the radio.

44:36.674 --> 44:39.426
So, that's where
all this rapping shit is going.

44:41.845 --> 44:43.514
Okay, well, I like it.

44:44.014 --> 44:47.851
But who is Roxanne? That ain't your name.
I ain't name you Roxanne.

44:47.935 --> 44:50.229
Is that your name?
I don't think that's your name.

44:50.312 --> 44:52.815
I didn't name you no damn Roxanne, now.

45:11.166 --> 45:13.919
Show me your teeth.
We need to check for braces.

45:14.002 --> 45:17.881
No, no. See, look, on the flyer,
they said anybody could get in.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.801
They got 2500 for the winner.
We here to win that.

45:20.884 --> 45:22.845
Nope. She won't show her teeth.

45:23.303 --> 45:26.515
I told you, we can't let the girl
with the braces battle.

45:26.598 --> 45:30.102
All these "rapper chicks" that's making
diss records about me?

45:30.185 --> 45:33.105
What we at now, like, 50 or something?
That's crazy.

45:33.188 --> 45:35.774
Fifty diss records about me
for this one song.

45:35.858 --> 45:37.568
They should be thanking me,

45:37.651 --> 45:40.612
sending me gifts for Mother's Day,
'cause I birthed they asses.

45:59.381 --> 46:01.091
And you know it like a poet,

46:01.175 --> 46:05.721
this is Magic 106FM, WHBI.
It's called "Roxanne Speaks Out."

46:05.804 --> 46:08.265
Hope you got it on tape,
you may never hear it again.

46:08.348 --> 46:11.685
Coming up on ten minutes
before the 2:00 hour in the a. m.

46:16.899 --> 46:17.733
Good?

46:18.650 --> 46:19.526
We good?

46:22.571 --> 46:24.156
Yeah.

46:24.239 --> 46:26.617
Right on.
You need something, let me know.

46:30.579 --> 46:33.790
Sparky Dee, Sparky Dee, Sparky Dee.

46:34.541 --> 46:37.377
What you gonna do about "Sparky's Turn"?
She cold got busy...

46:37.461 --> 46:40.839
Man, get out of here,
I told you, I'm done talking to you.

46:40.923 --> 46:44.927
Oh, you don't like to hear this?
I can turn it off if you want me to.

46:45.010 --> 46:46.053
Yo, come...

46:46.595 --> 46:50.140
Shan, I don't even know
why you bother to argue with fools.

46:50.224 --> 46:51.725
Ain't that right, Ranita?

46:52.434 --> 46:54.144
Everyone all right over here?

46:55.646 --> 46:57.564
Oh.

46:57.648 --> 47:00.275
Look at you, Shante. Looking all grown-up.

47:01.777 --> 47:04.863
- I'm glad everything working out for you.
- Thank you.

47:04.947 --> 47:07.074
Need something to drink? I got you.

47:07.866 --> 47:11.036
When you got free time,
let me take you out. Me and you.

47:11.620 --> 47:14.456
- Treat you to your success.
Let's go.

47:14.540 --> 47:15.958
Leave that little girl alone.

47:16.041 --> 47:19.378
She ain't gonna be little forever.
Ain't that right, Shante?

47:19.461 --> 47:20.796
I ain't little now.

47:21.755 --> 47:22.589
Shaunie.

47:24.007 --> 47:24.967
You ready to go?

47:25.759 --> 47:29.388
Yup. She's ready, I'm ready.
I got school tomorrow. Let's go.

47:29.471 --> 47:32.724
- I could take you home, Shante.
- She already got a ride.

47:32.808 --> 47:36.395
It's all good, big man.
Good job getting him out of here.

47:37.271 --> 47:38.897
You don't know me, homeboy.

47:39.856 --> 47:41.233
It's all good, homeboy.

47:41.775 --> 47:44.945
I'm just saying.
Shante gonna need some protection.

47:45.696 --> 47:47.197
She a big superstar now.

47:52.661 --> 47:53.495
All right.

47:54.329 --> 47:56.456
If y'all need something, I'm around.

48:03.922 --> 48:04.756
Yo, Shaunie.

48:06.550 --> 48:07.968
I need to holla at you.

48:12.389 --> 48:16.351
A hundred dollars
That's all this rap shit pay?

48:16.435 --> 48:18.186
I battled three times tonight.

48:18.270 --> 48:22.858
- I make more than this on the street, Ray.
- Come on, Shaunie. We only made $500.

48:22.941 --> 48:26.612
We owe 100 for the limo,
and the rest we split with everybody.

48:26.778 --> 48:31.241
Look. This is how it works.
It don't matter whose show it is.

48:31.325 --> 48:34.453
If everybody's working,
everybody gets paid the same.

48:34.536 --> 48:36.538
We gotta take care of the family.

48:37.080 --> 48:40.917
I'm gonna book you mad shows.
You gonna eat out here, I promise.

48:42.002 --> 48:43.670
Check out what I got for you.

48:44.630 --> 48:47.633
- You know I don't drink, Ray.
- Just open it.

48:47.716 --> 48:50.218
You know we use these bags for everything.

49:01.229 --> 49:02.397
Damn.

49:04.024 --> 49:05.651
This is dope.

49:06.902 --> 49:08.612
"Roxanne Shante."

49:08.695 --> 49:09.905
Say it loud.

49:12.574 --> 49:13.659
Thanks, Ray.

49:15.035 --> 49:16.161
I got you.

49:30.926 --> 49:33.970
The champ is here. The champ is here.

49:35.389 --> 49:37.432
We used to get busy.

49:38.016 --> 49:40.560
You should've seen us, Antwan.
Killing them.

49:41.478 --> 49:43.438
Well, you still killing them now.

49:43.897 --> 49:45.440
Yo, and keep killing them.

49:45.941 --> 49:49.653
All right, yeah. Ain't nobody
fucking with you while I'm around.

49:50.070 --> 49:54.199
Like tonight? Yo, I don't play with nobody
putting their hands on you.

49:55.158 --> 49:57.786
I'm always gonna be right there, ready.

49:58.954 --> 49:59.913
I know you will.

50:02.582 --> 50:03.417
Yo, Shaunie.

50:05.293 --> 50:08.714
Of course she is.

50:08.797 --> 50:12.509
This ain't nothing new.
I been telling them the champ is here.

50:12.592 --> 50:14.136
Y'all crazy.

50:15.303 --> 50:16.138
No.

50:17.180 --> 50:19.141
- We just love you, Shaunie.
- Yeah.

50:21.393 --> 50:22.436
Aw.

50:23.812 --> 50:24.896
I love y'all, too.

50:27.357 --> 50:29.317
Hey. You like the way I say that?

50:30.068 --> 50:30.944
No.

50:31.820 --> 50:34.906
The champ is here. The champ is here.

50:34.990 --> 50:36.533
The champ is here.

50:36.616 --> 50:39.244
Boogie down Bronx,
how y'all feeling tonight?

50:39.327 --> 50:41.621
Let's hear you make some noise!

50:43.373 --> 50:46.168
This is my DJ, Marley Marl,
with the funky mixes.

50:46.251 --> 50:50.172
We about to kick a new track for y'all.
A subject I know all about.

51:42.474 --> 51:45.602
Word. He got locked up last night.

51:45.685 --> 51:48.355
Antwan beat the shit out of somebody
that owed him money.

51:48.438 --> 51:50.065
Yup.

51:50.607 --> 51:51.942
Great show, Roxanne.

51:52.901 --> 51:54.361
- It was dope.
- Thanks.

51:54.945 --> 51:56.530
Can I get your autograph?

51:58.782 --> 52:02.410
I don't know. It ain't looking too good.

52:03.328 --> 52:05.330
You forgot to answer the question.

52:12.921 --> 52:15.757
Look what he asked me.
Like we in school or something.

52:20.011 --> 52:22.764
And you checked "no"? Shaunie, you cold.

52:22.848 --> 52:23.682
You cold.

52:24.391 --> 52:28.061
Here you go. I don't need no man,
and you too young for me.

52:28.186 --> 52:29.563
But we the same age.

52:30.105 --> 52:31.147
Exactly.

53:11.021 --> 53:12.647
I shouldn't even be here.

53:24.200 --> 53:25.035
After you.

53:41.176 --> 53:43.762
Before we go in, I need you
to put on this bandana.

53:43.845 --> 53:45.889
I ain't putting that on. For what?

53:46.389 --> 53:47.307
Just put it on.

53:49.100 --> 53:51.728
I already told you,
I shouldn't even be here.

53:52.312 --> 53:54.022
Shante, stop acting so tough.

53:54.648 --> 53:58.276
- Let me do something for you.
- You ain't gotta do nothing for me.

54:01.154 --> 54:02.864
This is so damn stupid.

54:05.408 --> 54:09.913
You gotta cut me some slack. I'm gonna
do some white folk shit for once.

54:18.046 --> 54:19.172
Hold out your hands.

54:27.722 --> 54:29.140
Is this mink?

54:30.475 --> 54:31.601
Who you think I am?

54:33.770 --> 54:35.146
It looks a little big.

54:36.314 --> 54:37.732
I'm pretty sure it fits.

54:50.620 --> 54:54.666
That ain't for you. That's mine.

54:54.749 --> 54:55.583
You like it?

55:00.296 --> 55:02.132
Cross, why you playing with me?

55:14.853 --> 55:16.771
Just wanted to match your fly...

55:17.564 --> 55:19.232
when I take you out tonight.

55:27.365 --> 55:28.950
I don't know about this.

55:29.034 --> 55:30.869
People gonna think we a couple.

55:36.374 --> 55:38.918
Ain't nobody ever gave me
nothing like this.

55:40.045 --> 55:41.963
Here, let's get it right on you.

55:44.299 --> 55:45.133
Cute.

55:47.761 --> 55:49.012
I like your freckles.

56:00.982 --> 56:02.650
I ain't ready for all that.

56:06.404 --> 56:07.238
Me neither.

56:28.510 --> 56:30.011
Pull over right up there.

56:30.970 --> 56:32.597
Right in front of this car.

56:44.400 --> 56:45.860
Pop the trunk button.

56:51.074 --> 56:51.908
Be right back.

57:23.606 --> 57:25.984
No. Just a little tired.

57:31.114 --> 57:32.031
Let's go.

57:33.700 --> 57:35.118
This is why I do this.

57:56.514 --> 57:58.808
Homeboy, you see who the fuck she with?

57:58.892 --> 58:01.686
It's nothing like that.
I'm just singing a song.

58:01.769 --> 58:02.979
Come on, Cross.

58:22.790 --> 58:23.791
You're beautiful.

58:27.337 --> 58:28.296
You cute, too.

58:29.839 --> 58:30.840
Pretty eyes.

58:31.925 --> 58:34.427
Every girl in here gonna be all on you.

58:36.554 --> 58:39.015
It's obvious who I'm here with tonight.

58:42.602 --> 58:44.687
Why you messing with me, Cross?

58:46.272 --> 58:47.857
You know how old I am?

58:50.693 --> 58:51.778
Good.

58:54.364 --> 58:56.866
I don't trust shit
moving out here, Shante.

59:00.328 --> 59:01.996
There's something about you.

59:05.041 --> 59:06.042
I want family.

59:06.918 --> 59:09.170
A family bond. I need that in my life.

59:12.757 --> 59:14.175
Let me give that to you.

59:17.220 --> 59:18.179
Give what to me?

59:19.764 --> 59:20.890
Love, Shante. You ever feel that?

59:27.272 --> 59:28.356
Hmm?

59:48.876 --> 59:51.546
I'm telling y'all, this is huge.

59:52.046 --> 59:54.382
We gonna get paid. Mm.

59:54.716 --> 59:57.719
Check it. We take them out on tour
like prize fighters.

59:57.802 --> 59:59.721
Make it a big event every night.

59:59.804 --> 01:00:03.349
<i>Roxanne Shante vs. Sparky Dee.
Round One.</i>

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:08.313
This will be epic. I mean, you ain't never
seen anything like this before.

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:11.065
And they're ripping each other apart.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.277
Fans gonna love this.

01:00:32.545 --> 01:00:33.880
Hey, you, new dude.

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:37.925
I'm in a rush. Next time.

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:41.137
Yeah, you. You see a lady
carrying bags, you help her.

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.681
My bad.

01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:45.892
You gotta pay some dues around here.

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:48.436
You gotta put in work if you wanna get to my level.
- Take my bags. - Let me kick my rhyme to you.

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:54.692
Yo, kid, if you wanted to rhyme,
you would've started already.

01:00:55.401 --> 01:00:57.195
But fuck it. Rap.

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:00.782
Yo... Yo...

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:06.746
What's your name?

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.207
- Nasir.
- Nasir.

01:01:10.124 --> 01:01:13.169
If you don't have your rap together
the next time I see you,

01:01:13.252 --> 01:01:14.587
I'm gonna fuck you up.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:17.799
I'm dead serious, too.
Take your ass to school.

01:01:20.968 --> 01:01:22.595
Why you over there, Ranita?

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:26.057
Just about to walk to school.

01:01:26.724 --> 01:01:28.976
- We can get you a ride.
- No, I'll walk.

01:01:30.478 --> 01:01:32.689
Yeah, I know.

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:36.567
Wish you could have found a way to come.

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:39.153
I don't.

01:01:43.157 --> 01:01:46.411
You was my first DJ and hype man.

01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:54.127
Feels like they waiting on you.

01:01:59.006 --> 01:01:59.841
Come here.

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:06.055
Why you so sad, Ranita?

01:02:07.014 --> 01:02:09.016
It's not like I'm not coming back.

01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:15.440
I don't wanna go either.

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:23.489
The first record was "Roxanne's Revenge."
I did it to prove a point.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.533
To prove to him that I could rap.

01:02:25.616 --> 01:02:29.620
The way it was done was, she was
doing laundry, washing drawers.

01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:33.124
I told her to forget about the laundry,
come up, do this record.

01:02:33.207 --> 01:02:36.127
So, she came up...

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:38.588
Just gonna bring up I was doing laundry?

01:02:38.671 --> 01:02:41.632
- He always telling the laundry story.
- It's the truth.

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:45.178
She was doing laundry,
I told her to come up and do this record.

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:48.848
Marley, I wasn't washing drawers.
It was my mother's laundry.

01:02:49.223 --> 01:02:53.519
Yo, if it wasn't for me, Shaunie,
you'd still be washing panties.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.607
Whatever. I still did
our biggest record in one take.

01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:02.737
Boom. I made a record and did laundry
at the same time.

01:03:03.654 --> 01:03:06.991
See what I've been telling you?
Gotta embrace and be nice

01:03:07.074 --> 01:03:10.244
when they're yelling,
"Roxanne, I wanna be your man."

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:12.163
Let their imagination work.

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:14.081
Feed them.

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:16.751
Hmm? Be a fantasy to them.

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:19.837
Yeah, they can be your man.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.050
Like this dude right here. Feed his ass. Look,
it's all a part of being Roxanne Shante, okay?

01:03:28.846 --> 01:03:30.973
Look, Shaunie, you a phenomenon now.

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:32.809
You coming, Roxanne?

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:37.772
Got you.

01:03:44.403 --> 01:03:46.948
I own, like, ten of these types
of garages.

01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:49.242
We get cars left and right.

01:03:49.742 --> 01:03:52.328
That's right.

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:55.164
These Southern boys get money, too.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.167
- Gimme a minute, playboy.
- All right.

01:03:58.251 --> 01:04:01.337
I wanna show you
what we call Southern hospitality.

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:05.675
I saved this one for you.

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:15.893
Seriously? We just met, Doug.
I don't know about all that.

01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:16.811
I don't care.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.188
You Roxanne Shante, baby.

01:04:19.605 --> 01:04:21.774
You bigtime. You deserve it.

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:24.151
It's nothing for me.

01:04:24.735 --> 01:04:28.281
I'm just enjoying this time with you.
Let me spend the money.

01:04:29.448 --> 01:04:30.575
So, do you want it?

01:04:34.245 --> 01:04:35.162
Of course.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:40.418
We got a connect at the DMV.
Should we put the car in your name?

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:44.338
I don't think it can go in my name.

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:47.425
It can go in my manager's name.

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:49.677
Let's do one more.

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:52.263
You like jewelry?

01:04:56.475 --> 01:04:58.978
You shouldn't be taking gifts from people.

01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:02.064
You heard me.

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:05.359
You shouldn't be taking gifts.
You know what they want.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:08.613
Ain't nobody giving nothing.
Mind your business.

01:05:08.696 --> 01:05:11.908
- You doing some ho shit, Shaunie.
- Fuck you, Marley.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:15.161
No, Ray. She acting like a ho.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:20.291
You just mad 'cause you can't fuck me.

01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:23.085
We brothers and sisters.
What is y'all on?

01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:25.838
Word up.
She really feeling herself right now.

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.341
Don't nobody want your young ass.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:31.302
You know what? Give me this shit.

01:05:31.636 --> 01:05:32.720
Get off me.

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:36.849
Fuck you. I don't give a fuck
about that shit anyway.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:40.144
Give it to one of your girlfriends,
broke-ass house DJ.

01:05:40.227 --> 01:05:42.396
- I fucking made you.
- Make another.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.274
You just jealous. You wanna be in my spot.

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:49.070
What's up, Shaunie?
What's the deal with y'all?

01:05:49.153 --> 01:05:51.948
Fuck him.

01:05:52.323 --> 01:05:55.034
I ain't DJ-ing your shit no more.
Ever again.

01:05:55.576 --> 01:05:57.453
Find somebody else. We done.

01:05:58.496 --> 01:05:59.622
Yeah, you jealous.

01:06:03.584 --> 01:06:06.170
- Yo, he got all my records.
- Yo, wait.

01:06:06.253 --> 01:06:09.131
You have to kill him
to get those records from him.

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:12.760
- He dead, then.
- Chill, Shaunie. You ain't got to do that.

01:06:12.843 --> 01:06:14.804
I'll beat-box the show for you.

01:06:14.887 --> 01:06:16.639
Yeah.

01:06:16.722 --> 01:06:19.725
Yeah, that's what I do.

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.894
Watch. They gonna love us.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.323
- I'll see you soon.
- Go back to school, little girl.

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:36.283
Hey, baby girl.

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:40.830
- Blackout, it's cool. I know him.
- She in good hands, big man.

01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:46.293
That's your new bodyguard? What happened
to the other big motherfucker?

01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:49.338
I needed some shit.

01:06:50.214 --> 01:06:53.009
Plus, you know, I had to come
check on my Shante.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:56.220
Roxanne, Roxanne. Mm.

01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:58.305
I wanna be your man.

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:02.643
- It takes a lot to be my man.
- Get your bitch-ass out of here, man.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.861
My bad, yo.

01:07:13.154 --> 01:07:15.156
I just ain't seen you in a minute.

01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:18.743
See if I bruised those freckles.

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:22.413
I gotta go do this show.

01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:24.957
I'll be right here.

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:27.251
Let's do this.

01:07:28.544 --> 01:07:30.713
You getting close to him, Shaunie?

01:07:30.796 --> 01:07:34.216
- This ain't good.
- Don't need to hear this right now, Shan.

01:07:35.092 --> 01:07:37.094
All day.

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:05.432
- Get off me, man...
- Ow.

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:10.062
You hit me in the my mouth, you asshole.
I told you I was sorry.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:11.897
Let me see, let me see.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:17.903
You all good.

01:09:20.781 --> 01:09:21.782
My bad, yo.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.372
Just get a little possessive over you.

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:32.626
I don't want nobody to fuck this up.

01:09:34.086 --> 01:09:36.296
I told you, it's just part of my job.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.176
I don't even like it when they do that.

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:42.803
I understand.

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:46.348
Hey. Sorry.

01:10:05.659 --> 01:10:06.744
Yo, Shaunie.

01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:10.039
Man, our tour money is gone.

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:13.542
I put my bags down in the bathroom.

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:16.462
When I came out the stall,
a couple of my bags were gone,

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:19.548
and the money was in one of them.
This just happened.

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:21.842
You call the police?
Tell the hotel people?

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:26.180
I had a lot of other shit in them bags.
I can't call the cops. It's gone.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.683
So, you telling me
all our tour money is gone?

01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:33.270
Most of it. I had already given
Marley and Sparky their cut,

01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:35.189
and I was about to bring you yours,

01:10:35.272 --> 01:10:38.192
and I come out the bathroom,
and my bags are gone.

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:39.693
Fuck, man.

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:44.990
It's gone.

01:10:45.157 --> 01:10:46.659
There's nothing I can do.

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:50.329
Back up.

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:51.455
Marley?

01:10:51.538 --> 01:10:54.166
- Man, fuck this. Give me my money.
- Chill.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:57.503
Let go, Sparky.
Fuck this rap shit. I need my money.

01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:59.838
- It ain't worth it, Shante.
- Let go, Sparky.

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:03.217
Fuck all y'all. If Antwan was here,
he'd beat the shit out of you.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.469
Antwan ain't gonna do shit.
- Fuck this.

01:11:05.552 --> 01:11:07.805
Ain't no fucking money
in this shit anyway.

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.890
That's right. Fuck them.

01:11:10.557 --> 01:11:14.478
You don't need them, Shaunie.
You got this without them, all right?

01:11:16.897 --> 01:11:17.731
All right? Here.

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:32.413
I know what we out here doing
and saying about each other.

01:11:32.746 --> 01:11:35.249
But we still sisters
at the end of the day.

01:11:51.765 --> 01:11:54.393
Yo, nigga. You think I'm playing, huh?

01:11:55.436 --> 01:11:59.982
<i>You ran off with my fucking package.
You better hit this motherfucker back.</i>

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:22.880
You ready to order?

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:25.883
Still looking.
Give us five more minutes.

01:12:25.966 --> 01:12:27.968
I'll take a beer. Whatever you got.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:29.428
We got High Life.

01:12:30.637 --> 01:12:33.640
How about you, miss?
You look like you need a drink.

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:36.769
I bring you the beer, okay?

01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:38.354
I'll come back.

01:12:43.942 --> 01:12:45.152
What you staring at?

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:48.572
You looking at me the whole time.

01:12:48.655 --> 01:12:52.659
Trying to figure out who you are
and why you in my motherfucking face.

01:12:54.119 --> 01:12:57.081
This your new boyfriend, Shante?
Huh

01:12:57.664 --> 01:13:00.417
You wanna be grown so bad,
you got yourself an old man?

01:13:03.587 --> 01:13:05.756
You a nasty motherfucker.

01:13:05.839 --> 01:13:10.094
What do you want
I keep trying to tell you.

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:14.973
You stir up enough shit, eventually,
shit's gonna splash you on your ass.

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:17.684
And I see this piece of shit
is all over you.

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:20.854
Do you know how old she is?

01:13:21.772 --> 01:13:23.023
She's 16.

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:28.445
- You look like you damn near my age.
- You sounding like a scorned woman.

01:13:30.322 --> 01:13:34.034
Somebody must have hurt you real bad.
Hate every man walking.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:38.330
You don't want her to be happy?
You want her to be miserable like you?

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:44.878
Just a trifling motherfucker.
Shante, you fucking this nigga?

01:13:46.213 --> 01:13:48.882
I ain't got time for this.

01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:50.968
Yeah. Take your punk ass
out the restaurant.

01:13:51.051 --> 01:13:53.846
- Cross, wait.
- Don't you be running after no man.

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:55.722
I'm moving to Jersey with you.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:59.935
- Go back there with your crazy-ass momma.
- No.

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:02.896
You ain't ready for all this, Shante.

01:14:04.481 --> 01:14:05.315
Go.

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:24.978
You'll learn how to control your mouth,
or I'll keep beating your ass.

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:27.940
Keep disrespecting me,
keep doing that shit.

01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:30.943
Get the fuck up.
I ain't playing with you. Get up.

01:15:32.152 --> 01:15:33.403
Fuck out of my house.

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.366
Get the fuck out.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.705
Get the Huh?

01:15:45.916 --> 01:15:49.419
Fuck you, motherfucker! I hate you!

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.510
Come on, Roxanne.
I know you can give me a smile.

01:15:57.302 --> 01:15:58.136
I can't.

01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:02.015
Come on.
But you're too pretty to not be smiling.

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:05.310
I can't move my fucking jaw.
Take the damn picture.

01:16:07.688 --> 01:16:08.772
It's beautiful.

01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:12.901
See

01:16:12.985 --> 01:16:17.197
No, I'm good. Thanks, though.

01:16:17.447 --> 01:16:20.409
What's been up, Shaunie?
We've been looking for you.

01:16:21.451 --> 01:16:24.204
Heard you in Newark
with a family and everything.

01:16:24.871 --> 01:16:26.123
Congrats on your son.

01:16:27.457 --> 01:16:29.626
Yo, check it. I got some good news.

01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:32.879
Cold Chillin' got a deal with Warner Bros.

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:36.383
They don't wanna do it without you.
They wanna push you.

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:41.305
Ray, it's been four years,
and I ain't got no damn album.

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:45.642
Tell me why.
'Cause you don't wanna pay me.

01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:47.686
That's what we gonna do, Shaunie.

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:51.189
Get that first album out,
and then take you out on tour.

01:16:52.232 --> 01:16:53.066
For real.

01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:58.864
Look. I'm sorry, Shaunie. That's just how
I thought shit was supposed to be.

01:16:59.656 --> 01:17:01.116
I promise. Not this time.

01:17:03.076 --> 01:17:04.244
We've all learned.

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:08.123
Fuck you. Fuck rap.

01:17:08.915 --> 01:17:10.834
I ain't making no money rapping.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:13.462
Really. Fuck Roxanne Shante.

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:17.007
Because of her,
I'm getting my ass beat every day.

01:17:19.134 --> 01:17:20.677
Think about this, Shaunie.

01:17:29.561 --> 01:17:31.188
Act right, Shaunie.

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.119
How do I look?

01:17:47.871 --> 01:17:49.081
You look good.

01:17:49.706 --> 01:17:53.710
- You used to hate the clothes I got you.
- Yeah, them church clothes.

01:17:54.544 --> 01:17:58.090
Shaunie, I can't believe
you wanna cut all this beautiful hair.

01:17:58.298 --> 01:18:01.426
I have to, 'Nessa. Roxanne Shante gotta go.
She is the ponytail and I need a change.

01:18:06.264 --> 01:18:07.516
I hate to cut it.

01:18:12.479 --> 01:18:13.438
Hey, Ms. Peggy.

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:16.858
Hey, 'Nessa. Hi, Mommy.

01:18:19.903 --> 01:18:20.862
Hey, Shante.

01:18:24.449 --> 01:18:27.744
Your old man kicked you out,
and you're running back home?

01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:30.372
I brought the girls clothes,
and was gonna take them to get ice cream.

01:18:30.455 --> 01:18:31.748
Well, they can't go.

01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:37.462
No ice cream before dinner.

01:18:38.588 --> 01:18:39.548
Mommy.

01:18:41.007 --> 01:18:42.718
Why are you getting your hair fried?

01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:46.179
You got my house smelling
like you been ironing dirty jeans.

01:18:46.263 --> 01:18:49.182
Why don't you go
to the beauty salon, superstar?

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:36.772
Shante.

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:43.069
Why are you coming in here?

01:19:53.538 --> 01:19:54.915
Why you all tensed up?

01:20:02.172 --> 01:20:04.007
Are you gonna act like that now?

01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:08.678
Can I finish my bath?

01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:22.150
I only hit you 'cause I love you.

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:25.237
You know that, right?

01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:30.075
If I didn't care, I wouldn't do that.

01:20:48.969 --> 01:20:49.803
Come on.

01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:09.406
I love you, you know?

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.049
It looks good on you.

01:22:01.416 --> 01:22:03.585

The record label want me back.

01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:32.113
Well, go back, then.

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:35.492
And my sisters need me.

01:22:36.826 --> 01:22:39.245
It's just a lot, and I can't...

01:22:45.543 --> 01:22:46.378
I can't.

01:22:50.006 --> 01:22:50.840
I just...

01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:58.181
I think it's quits.

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:02.143
It's quits.

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:09.317
Fuck you think this is?

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:19.828
This is some grown-up shit,
Ms. Roxanne Shante. Ain't no quits.

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:52.277
How are those ribs feeling today?

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:56.573
You did fracture three of them,
so you're gonna be in pain for a while.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:24:00.827
Get some rest and we should be able
to release you tomorrow morning.

01:24:01.119 --> 01:24:04.289
We talked to your father.
He going to sign the release forms.

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:05.749
You talked to my father?

01:24:06.332 --> 01:24:08.752
Yeah, Mr. James Cross.

01:24:09.335 --> 01:24:12.672
He was here with your little brother?
You didn't see them?

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:15.967
Shante.

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:18.595
Careful, okay? Be careful.

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:21.890
Ms. Gooden, do you need anything else?

01:24:21.973 --> 01:24:22.932
No.

01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:26.811
- Thank you, nurse.
- You're welcome.

01:24:28.605 --> 01:24:31.649
All right now, girls. Come on.
Sit down. Sit down.

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:33.985
Give your sister some room to breathe.
What the hell happened to you, Shante?

01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:04.516
I just wanted to be a kid, Mommy.

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:08.937
That's all.

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:17.112
I watched my whole life change that day.

01:25:21.616 --> 01:25:23.076
I lost you.

01:25:27.163 --> 01:25:28.665
I lost my friend.

01:25:31.543 --> 01:25:33.086
I lost my mommy.

01:25:38.508 --> 01:25:40.218
When you took that drink...

01:25:44.514 --> 01:25:46.099
it all fell on me.

01:26:21.968 --> 01:26:23.845
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:26:27.765 --> 01:26:29.017
I'm so sorry.

01:26:40.945 --> 01:26:43.865
So, you mean
you haven't seen Chucky in two weeks?

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.284
That motherfucker.

01:26:48.286 --> 01:26:50.830
Look, Shante, you gotta talk to him.

01:26:51.497 --> 01:26:53.041
You gotta get Chucky back.

01:26:56.502 --> 01:26:57.921
You don't miss your son?

01:26:59.130 --> 01:27:00.673
Of course I miss my baby.

01:27:01.674 --> 01:27:03.301
Then you gotta talk to him.

01:27:08.348 --> 01:27:11.601
Well... at least let me talk to him.

01:27:14.604 --> 01:27:15.688
Dial the number.

01:27:21.444 --> 01:27:24.072
<i>Hello?</i>

01:27:24.697 --> 01:27:27.909
<i>- Put Shante on the phone.
- She don't wanna talk to you.</i>

01:27:28.451 --> 01:27:30.870
<i>Put Shante on the phone
or I'm hanging up.</i>

01:27:33.873 --> 01:27:35.208
You gotta talk to him.

01:27:42.298 --> 01:27:43.383
<i>Come home, Shante.</i>

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:52.141
Say it.

01:27:56.854 --> 01:27:58.273
I hit you 'cause I love you.

01:27:59.816 --> 01:28:01.609
<i>Now, bring your ass back home.</i>

01:28:02.235 --> 01:28:03.861
I just want Kareem.

01:28:04.654 --> 01:28:08.449
You just want Kareem
That's all you want?

01:28:08.533 --> 01:28:11.911
<i>Cross, just stop.</i>

01:28:11.995 --> 01:28:14.706
- I ain't coming back.
- No, bitch, ain't no stopping this.

01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:19.502
You want your son back?
You're gonna listen to me, goddamn it.

01:28:19.752 --> 01:28:23.589
<i>I gave you the world, Shante.
And now you don't wanna act right.</i>

01:28:24.173 --> 01:28:25.800
I should've beat your ass worse.

01:28:25.883 --> 01:28:29.387
<i>You shut your mouth,
we wouldn't even be in this situation.</i>

01:28:36.227 --> 01:28:37.729
You know what? Fuck it.

01:28:39.814 --> 01:28:43.985
About through with your ass anyway.
You want him back? Ten Gs.

01:28:46.571 --> 01:28:47.572
You got 10 thou?

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:54.495
<i>Yeah, that's what I thought.</i>

01:28:57.957 --> 01:28:59.792
Now, bring your ass back home.

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:09.761
You know, Shante,
you people never cease to amaze me.

01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:10.928
I...

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:15.141
I can't help you buy your baby back.
You can't buy and sell people.

01:29:15.641 --> 01:29:18.853
What is wrong with you?
This is like modern-day slavery.

01:29:18.936 --> 01:29:23.191
The chutzpah of this motherfucker.
Wants to sell his own kid for $10,000.

01:29:23.608 --> 01:29:26.986
And you sit here wanting me
to give you fucking paperwork

01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:29.906
to solidify the sale?
It's un-fucking-believable.

01:29:33.284 --> 01:29:34.118
Fuck.

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:40.833
I can't believe I'm gonna help you with
this shit. And you better not tell a soul.

01:29:50.259 --> 01:29:52.220
You ain't even gotta pay me back.

01:29:53.096 --> 01:29:53.971
I owe you one.

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:58.684
Again, my bad about that, Shante.

01:30:00.144 --> 01:30:03.147
Yo, let me know
where you gonna meet up with dude.

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:07.068
You know I can get that 10 back
and it'll be all yours. For real.

01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:11.739
You meet him, give him the bread,
and then you move out with the baby.

01:30:12.657 --> 01:30:13.616
And we move in.

01:30:16.452 --> 01:30:20.706
It'll be just another nigga dead.
People die around here all the time.

01:30:22.041 --> 01:30:24.043
Won't nobody think twice about him.

01:30:25.628 --> 01:30:28.214
You won't ever have
to worry about him again.

01:30:33.052 --> 01:30:34.011
I can't do that.

01:30:35.888 --> 01:30:36.889
You sure, Shante?

01:30:59.162 --> 01:31:01.289
What's the shit you want me to sign?

01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:27.899
You always gonna be my woman.

01:31:29.817 --> 01:31:30.651
Remember that.

01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:43.539
Chuck.

01:32:09.273 --> 01:32:10.816
It's a big house in Newark.

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:14.570
Oh, baby. It is so good them girls
are moving out there with you.

01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:17.156
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, Ms. Peggy told me. She was...

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:20.910
The way she was smiling? I ain't seen her
grinning like that for years.

01:32:20.993 --> 01:32:23.454
Yeah. And my first album about to drop.

01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:26.082
- It's looking good, Ms. Denise.
- Congrats.

01:32:26.165 --> 01:32:29.919
Girl, I am so proud of you.
Making all of us out here look good.

01:32:30.753 --> 01:32:32.213
This cutie-pie here.

01:32:32.964 --> 01:32:36.092
We about to get ice cream and check out
the Park Jam if you wanna come.

01:32:36.175 --> 01:32:39.011
Oh, no, girl.
My back has been giving me problems.

01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:42.348
But I'm still hanging in there.
Like a loose tooth.

01:32:42.431 --> 01:32:44.767
I'll cook some food.
That's what I'll do.

01:32:44.850 --> 01:32:47.645
You want some of that?
That's good, right

01:32:47.728 --> 01:32:51.649
You better not walk past me
and not say nothing.

01:32:52.608 --> 01:32:54.610
Peace, Shante.

01:32:55.278 --> 01:32:56.946
You done grew up on me.

01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:59.657
Nas.

01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:01.867
All right, Nas.

01:33:02.952 --> 01:33:03.911
Bust your rhyme.

01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:07.290
You remember what I told you
if you ain't know your shit.

01:33:07.373 --> 01:33:09.792
- Hi, Ms. Denise.
- You gonna get fucked up.

01:33:09.875 --> 01:33:12.545
- Let me hear it.
- Take your ass back upstairs.

01:33:12.628 --> 01:33:14.797
Go ahead.
- Nobody got time for this.

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:17.717
You thought I was playing?
- Look at your girl.

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:21.929
- Look at that. She just like you.
- Hey, Mommy. Come check this kid out.

01:33:22.013 --> 01:33:24.724
He say he can rap.
He gotta prove it, though.

01:33:27.685 --> 01:33:29.979
You trying to battle rap my girl, Nasir?

01:33:30.062 --> 01:33:33.691
The Queensbridge Champ
since she was 9? She ain't never lost.

01:33:33.774 --> 01:33:36.444
How much money you got?
She don't rap for free.

01:34:07.224 --> 01:34:08.934
Yeah.

01:34:11.645 --> 01:34:13.647
- That was good.
- Thanks.

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:15.358
Good job.

01:34:16.108 --> 01:34:17.526
Take your ass to school.

01:34:27.036 --> 01:34:30.331
The reason it's important
for a man to know more about a woman

01:34:30.414 --> 01:34:33.417
is 'cause then he knows
the things that she likes done,

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:35.836
and the things he should do
to keep her happy,

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:39.507
'cause that's what we're trying to do.
Get more back into the family thing.

01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:42.259
And you can't have a family if you don't
know what it takes to have one.

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:45.262
The reason why I feel
we lost the family thing is because...

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:48.974
And, fellas, please don't get mad at me.
Please. Please don't.

01:34:50.393 --> 01:34:52.728
...men weren't living up
to their responsibilities.

01:34:52.812 --> 01:34:54.730
I don't know if I should say this.

01:34:56.774 --> 01:35:00.694
They weren't. I say that because
fellas got more into hanging out.

01:35:00.778 --> 01:35:02.863
They didn't wanna be home, flowers...

01:35:02.947 --> 01:35:06.617
Nobody was buying flowers anymore.
You had to die to get flowers.
