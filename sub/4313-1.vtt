03:57.062 --> 03:58.890
He's still working on it.

03:58.977 --> 04:00.762
Never seems to finish.

04:11.294 --> 04:13.862
No one's been here
in months.

04:13.949 --> 04:17.039
Season doesn't really start
until Memorial Day.

04:24.829 --> 04:27.876
Looks like we have the whole
neighborhood to ourselves.

04:38.147 --> 04:39.496
Hey...

04:42.194 --> 04:46.677
I've been thinking about this,
like, you have no idea.

05:01.518 --> 05:03.477
I missed you.

05:15.837 --> 05:18.927
So, uh, what do you
want to do?

06:05.539 --> 06:06.888
Where are you going?

06:06.975 --> 06:10.152
I'm just going to run
to the restroom.

06:10.239 --> 06:12.720
I'll be back in a sec.

06:15.766 --> 06:20.989
You know, it's not bad here in,
like, January, February.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.730
Yeah?

06:24.819 --> 06:26.516
Well...

06:26.603 --> 06:28.300
I was thinking that maybe we
could live here,

06:28.388 --> 06:29.693
like year-round.

06:31.303 --> 06:33.088
I mean, the house is just
sitting here empty.

06:34.263 --> 06:35.873
It's such a waste.

06:38.615 --> 06:40.835
Well, what about
my grad school?

06:40.922 --> 06:42.619
Can't that wait?

06:45.100 --> 06:46.623
I mean, that's, like years.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.843
I mean, it's such bullshit.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.846
You know it is.

06:51.933 --> 06:54.414
No, not really.

06:55.327 --> 06:56.633
Think about it.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.593
It'd be a vacation all the time.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.595
Isn't that what we want?

07:05.120 --> 07:08.166
Don't be scared.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.573
Randall, get up.

10:17.660 --> 10:18.835
Someone's here.

10:18.922 --> 10:21.490
- What?
- Someone's in the house.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.274
Well, that's impossible.

10:23.361 --> 10:25.668
- No one should be here.
- Well, they're downstairs.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.757
- Get dressed.
- Who is it?

10:27.844 --> 10:29.977
I don't know. Some woman.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.283
Perfect.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.355
She was right there.

11:03.184 --> 11:04.533
Hello?

11:04.620 --> 11:05.795
Jesus!

11:05.882 --> 11:07.623
Who are you?

11:07.710 --> 11:09.364
What are you doing
in my house?

11:11.279 --> 11:12.846
Your house?

11:12.933 --> 11:16.284
Doc never said anyone
was gonna be here.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.242
You spoke to my father?

11:19.113 --> 11:21.419
You're Randy?

11:22.769 --> 11:25.685
Oh, you got so big.

11:25.772 --> 11:28.644
I haven't seen you since...

11:28.731 --> 11:30.777
Mm...

11:30.864 --> 11:32.300
It's been years.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.129
We stayed here
with your family.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.219
Jane, honey,
sorry I took so long.

11:38.306 --> 11:41.918
The nearest open store
is an hour away.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.705
Well...

11:46.880 --> 11:48.316
It's Randy.

11:48.403 --> 11:50.231
Doc's son.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.800
Is that right?

11:53.887 --> 11:55.802
Well, Randall now.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.804
Well, Randall.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.196
Mitch Turner.

12:00.763 --> 12:02.547
You've met my wife Jane.

12:02.634 --> 12:03.897
It's good to see you.

12:03.984 --> 12:07.291
I taught with Doc
at Brighton High,

12:07.378 --> 12:09.424
maybe, uh, 20 years ago.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.079
And you are?

12:12.166 --> 12:14.124
Uh, sorry, I'm Emily.
Emily Kirk.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.691
I'm Randall's girlfriend.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.911
Oh, it's very nice
to meet you.

12:17.998 --> 12:19.390
Nice to meet you.
I'm so sorry about this.

12:19.477 --> 12:20.827
We don't want
to ruin your weekend.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.916
We can, uh,
go to a hotel, or...

12:23.003 --> 12:24.221
We don't want to impose
or anything.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.049
No, we're only in one bedroom.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.443
There's plenty of space.

12:28.530 --> 12:32.186
It'd be so great to have
dinner with you tonight.

12:32.273 --> 12:35.624
I'm kind of a grill master,
at least Jane says so.

12:35.711 --> 12:37.757
He is.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.193
Yeah, sure.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.282
That sounds good.

12:41.369 --> 12:43.066
Thank you. Uh...

12:43.153 --> 12:45.547
Randall, I'm gonna go
get the bags...

12:45.634 --> 12:46.722
Okay.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.115
...from the car.

12:49.029 --> 12:50.944
I'll be there
in a minute.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.294
Excuse me.

13:24.716 --> 13:26.414
So who are they?

13:26.501 --> 13:30.200
Some old friends
of my father, it seems.

13:30.287 --> 13:35.379
They obviously spoke to Doc
before coming here.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.904
Did you happen to tell him
that we were gonna be here?

13:37.991 --> 13:40.123
Things have been strained
between us lately.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.821
It's not my fault.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.825
Of course.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.784
You know, I thought it would be
a good idea

13:48.871 --> 13:50.830
to come here with you
and straighten some things out.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.527
And now it's not?

13:52.614 --> 13:54.268
I'm serious.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.053
You know, I...

13:58.098 --> 13:59.926
I thought we were good.

14:00.013 --> 14:02.276
And then you leave school,

14:02.363 --> 14:04.278
you leave me.

14:04.365 --> 14:07.194
No calls,
some cryptic emails.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.152
I mean, are you kidding me?

14:09.239 --> 14:12.895
And now, here we are,
back at it again

14:12.982 --> 14:14.897
like nothing's changed.

14:16.159 --> 14:18.553
And we could have gone
somewhere else.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.294
We could have gone anywhere.

14:20.381 --> 14:21.861
Emily...

14:23.863 --> 14:25.865
I fucked up.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.650
I wanted to be here with you,
that's all.

14:28.737 --> 14:30.260
So they're here.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.134
We'll figure it out.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.483
We have time.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.138
I promise.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.097
It'll be fine, okay?

14:42.403 --> 14:43.578
Okay.

14:45.623 --> 14:47.582
I do love you, you know.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.499
I love you, too.

15:20.093 --> 15:22.182
And here comes
this three-year-old kid

15:22.269 --> 15:24.358
who wouldn't eat
anything we made,

15:24.445 --> 15:27.361
just scarfing down
these oysters.

15:27.448 --> 15:30.364
I think I puked
my brains out.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.540
You liked them.

15:32.627 --> 15:35.195
No oysters tonight?

15:36.805 --> 15:38.459
Fine.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.635
For old times' sake.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.906
Yeah, um...

15:50.993 --> 15:53.517
I think I liked them more
when I didn't know any better.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.870
I'm not even going
to attempt that.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.698
Mm-mmm, not for me.

16:00.785 --> 16:02.396
It's an acquired taste.

16:02.483 --> 16:07.401
Yeah. My idea of the beach
is a book and a blanket.

16:07.488 --> 16:09.316
Not shellfish.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.144
What are you studying
at school, Emily?

16:11.231 --> 16:13.320
Organic chemistry.
I'm finishing up my third year.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.017
Five more weeks.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.932
Chemistry? That's...
That's an ambitious major.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.326
Yeah, yeah. I, um...

16:19.413 --> 16:21.328
I did it as a bit
of a challenge to myself.

16:21.415 --> 16:26.594
I figured I could study anything
after four years of chemistry.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.639
- You thinking about grad school?
- Yeah.

16:28.726 --> 16:32.078
I want to study astrobiology
at the University of Washington.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.080
They have a great program.

16:34.167 --> 16:36.430
What is that?
Life on other planets?

16:36.517 --> 16:38.258
Kind of.

16:38.345 --> 16:41.130
It actually has more to do
with life on this planet.

16:41.217 --> 16:45.134
How organisms can adapt
to extreme environments

16:45.221 --> 16:47.702
that we could not even survive.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.312
It's, um...

16:49.399 --> 16:51.793
It's the point where chemistry
becomes biology.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.535
Somewhere at the bottom
of the ocean, we think.

16:58.974 --> 17:02.108
Life is so fragile.

17:03.326 --> 17:06.112
We're the right
combination of elements.

17:06.199 --> 17:10.464
The right temperature.
The right distance from the sun.

17:10.550 --> 17:15.121
And this measure of time
spent developing

17:15.208 --> 17:17.513
and changing.

17:17.601 --> 17:19.473
Billions of years.

17:19.560 --> 17:24.130
One thing slightly off,
and we would be nothing.

17:24.217 --> 17:27.089
Dust or gas or something.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.007
I'm in awe of it.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.970
Over my head.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.148
Randall, how'd you end up
with someone so smart?

17:42.235 --> 17:44.454
Lucky, I guess.

17:44.541 --> 17:47.066
Randall, what are you
studying at college?

17:47.153 --> 17:50.460
Um... Well,
I'm not really there now.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.332
Oh, yeah?

17:52.419 --> 17:54.595
Yeah. I just...

17:56.423 --> 17:57.641
I'd had it with school.

17:57.728 --> 18:00.209
I needed to get away,
you know?

18:00.296 --> 18:03.691
Doc probably wasn't
thrilled with that.

18:05.432 --> 18:06.650
No.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.348
No, he was not.

18:08.435 --> 18:12.091
Things are a little
different now, with college.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.353
Like, they're farming
graduates.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.138
I didn't want
what school offered,

18:16.225 --> 18:18.184
what the rest of my life
was gonna be.

18:18.271 --> 18:22.623
I mean, it's like,
what am I learning?

18:23.667 --> 18:25.278
What's the point
of an education?

18:25.365 --> 18:27.193
Just to... to get a job?

18:27.280 --> 18:29.456
I mean, there has to be
something else, right?

18:29.543 --> 18:31.327
What's underneath
all of this?

18:31.414 --> 18:33.895
The... The marriage, kids,

18:33.982 --> 18:36.027
taxes, bills,
watching television,

18:36.115 --> 18:38.378
elections, sports on Sunday.

18:38.465 --> 18:41.511
Careful. I coached
a state champion baseball team.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.905
Look, no offense.

18:43.992 --> 18:45.907
I just don't know.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.952
You know, I'm figuring it out.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.215
For me.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.042
Well, it's complicated.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.566
I just wouldn't write off

18:52.653 --> 18:55.873
everyone who thinks
differently than you do.

18:55.960 --> 18:59.094
You should be thankful
that you have the time

18:59.181 --> 19:00.617
to do whatever you want.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.448
It...

19:08.016 --> 19:10.149
It is nice to hear...

19:11.802 --> 19:13.152
that spirit.

19:14.675 --> 19:17.765
We are so fortunate
to be here with you.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.549
It's just...

19:21.508 --> 19:23.162
It's just so nice.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.350
Well, uh,

19:37.437 --> 19:38.786
does anyone need a refill?

19:38.873 --> 19:40.614
Yes, please.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.925
Uh-oh.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.666
Bad news.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.015
Are we out?

19:51.102 --> 19:53.844
Last bottle of chardonnay.

19:53.931 --> 19:55.281
Half-empty.

19:56.978 --> 20:00.416
Doc doesn't have any bottles
stashed away anywhere?

20:00.503 --> 20:02.810
I could use a little whiskey.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.290
No.

20:04.377 --> 20:05.943
Nothing's open
this time of night.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.424
Well, and we shouldn't
be driving anyway.

20:11.079 --> 20:13.560
There is something else.

20:21.045 --> 20:23.004
- Mr. Turner.
- "Mitch," please.

20:23.091 --> 20:24.745
Mitch, Jane...

20:26.747 --> 20:28.531
are you familiar
with edibles?

20:28.618 --> 20:30.272
Randall...

20:30.359 --> 20:32.231
Times being
what they are,

20:32.318 --> 20:33.580
legalization and all.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.190
I don't think
this is appropriate.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.714
Well, it's only polite to share.

20:40.587 --> 20:43.416
Edible marijuana?
Is that what you mean?

20:47.724 --> 20:49.900
Are you fucking insane?

20:49.987 --> 20:52.338
What? I got them at a
dispensary before I picked you up.

20:52.425 --> 20:54.601
They even said that most
of the customers are, like,

20:54.688 --> 20:56.037
50, 60 years old.

20:56.124 --> 20:58.387
This is a really
bad idea, Randall.

20:58.474 --> 20:59.867
What's he gonna do,
tell my dad?

20:59.954 --> 21:01.477
She's medicated.

21:01.564 --> 21:03.523
It'll probably
do her some good.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.352
I don't think it's a good idea.

21:06.439 --> 21:07.875
You already ate.
We're not gonna be driving.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.224
Okay.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.357
How strong are they?

21:11.444 --> 21:13.359
They'll be fine.

21:13.446 --> 21:14.969
Randall?

21:16.275 --> 21:19.539
Do we cut it in quarters?

21:30.811 --> 21:35.163
So wait, tell me
about this astrobiology?

21:35.250 --> 21:39.776
Well,
it's like the origins of life on Earth.

21:39.863 --> 21:43.737
As we study the basic building
blocks of life on other planets,

21:43.824 --> 21:46.696
it helps us
with our origins.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.481
Finding any evidence of water
is a good start.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.221
Didn't they just
find water on Mars?

21:50.309 --> 21:53.137
Uh, yeah, kind of.

21:53.224 --> 21:55.096
Very recently.

21:55.183 --> 21:58.752
It's like, there are these
very basic elements

21:58.839 --> 22:01.972
that were present at the
earliest stages of the planet,

22:02.059 --> 22:05.628
and the heat from the from
the core of the earth,

22:05.715 --> 22:08.283
it kept churning these elements

22:08.370 --> 22:10.938
for millions and millions
of years.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.202
Evaporating, hardening...

22:18.728 --> 22:20.774
The atmosphere is, like,

22:20.861 --> 22:24.343
steam from water
hitting a hot rock.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.040
But it's like

22:26.127 --> 22:29.957
something foreign had to enter
the environment

22:30.044 --> 22:32.307
for nucleic acids to form.

22:32.394 --> 22:35.354
That initial drop,

22:35.441 --> 22:37.399
where did it come from?

22:37.486 --> 22:40.924
And then it started reacting,
replicating,

22:41.011 --> 22:45.189
into what would become
the bottom of the ocean.

22:58.855 --> 23:01.467
Soft water.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.910
I'm getting my diver's
certification,

23:09.997 --> 23:13.392
so I can go on
deep-sea studies...

23:14.784 --> 23:18.092
in some of the most inhospitable
places on the planet.

23:20.007 --> 23:21.791
If we can find organisms

23:21.878 --> 23:24.620
that could live in such
harsh conditions here, then...

23:24.707 --> 23:27.884
Oh, like an alien planet.

23:29.495 --> 23:30.887
I mean...

23:32.889 --> 23:34.108
I guess.

23:36.023 --> 23:39.940
All other planets are too harsh
for life as we know it.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.422
We are the exception.

23:45.162 --> 23:46.468
We're delicate.

23:50.298 --> 23:53.170
What would it
have looked like?

23:53.257 --> 23:54.476
What?

23:54.563 --> 23:56.260
Our planet.

23:56.347 --> 23:58.437
The surface back then.

24:00.308 --> 24:01.788
I don't know.

24:07.271 --> 24:09.622
Swirling gases.

24:12.146 --> 24:14.322
Unstable.

24:14.409 --> 24:15.889
Boiling.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.240
Chaos.

24:19.327 --> 24:20.850
Hm.

25:43.585 --> 25:46.457
It's so beautiful.

25:49.460 --> 25:53.290
Randall, have you
seen this out here before?

25:53.377 --> 25:54.901
No way.

25:56.511 --> 25:58.165
Super trippy.

26:05.825 --> 26:08.654
It's all over.

26:08.741 --> 26:10.873
It's in the trees.

26:14.747 --> 26:18.185
Windswept microbes of some kind.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.015
Something in the air.

26:23.494 --> 26:25.366
Usually it's in
the water.

26:25.453 --> 26:28.064
Oh, I want to see.

26:29.631 --> 26:30.893
You think you should?

26:30.980 --> 26:34.288
Oh, please, Mitchell.
I'm fine.

26:34.375 --> 26:36.290
I'm having such a good time.

26:36.377 --> 26:38.161
Fine, fine.

26:44.515 --> 26:46.822
I think I need
a new song.

26:51.479 --> 26:54.613
Mm. I'm sorry,
I should have asked.

26:57.485 --> 26:59.226
With all your science...

26:59.313 --> 27:00.444
I know.

27:00.531 --> 27:01.663
I know it's stupid.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.056
I'll say.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.103
Randall hates it, too.

27:09.453 --> 27:11.194
I want to be a scientist,

27:11.281 --> 27:14.676
but I still do dumb shit.

27:31.388 --> 27:32.868
You okay, Mrs. Turner?

27:32.955 --> 27:34.261
Hmm?

27:34.348 --> 27:35.654
You feeling it?

27:35.741 --> 27:39.266
Oh, I'm just having
so much fun.

27:40.659 --> 27:44.445
That music sounded alive.

27:44.532 --> 27:46.360
Yeah?

27:46.447 --> 27:47.796
That's awesome.

27:50.233 --> 27:54.020
It's gonna be
amazing outside.

28:04.204 --> 28:07.686
You kids today,
how you see the world.

28:08.861 --> 28:10.689
It's so different.

28:12.038 --> 28:15.215
All the information
out there, it's...

28:16.651 --> 28:18.305
scary.

28:18.392 --> 28:20.699
No, don't...
Don't be scared. It...

28:21.874 --> 28:24.050
The doors that could be open

28:24.137 --> 28:27.053
because of that
information should...

28:28.141 --> 28:31.666
It should make life
more beautiful.

28:33.015 --> 28:36.932
We're learning
so much so fast.

28:38.455 --> 28:41.937
I think that's why
I put my head down

28:42.024 --> 28:44.679
and focus on our
baseball team.

28:47.943 --> 28:50.250
It kind of smells
out here.

28:51.468 --> 28:52.818
You smell that?

28:55.603 --> 28:56.909
Yeah, I do.

28:58.519 --> 29:00.869
I wonder if sewage
is backed up.

29:02.175 --> 29:05.221
I felt a little
light-headed before.

29:08.442 --> 29:10.879
Have you seen my wife?

29:12.315 --> 29:14.056
Um...

29:18.887 --> 29:20.193
No, I haven't.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.325
She... She's very...

29:25.024 --> 29:27.504
I h... I have to look out
for her.

29:27.591 --> 29:28.723
Yeah.

29:28.810 --> 29:30.290
I really...

29:30.377 --> 29:32.379
I really shouldn't have
let her do this.

30:37.792 --> 30:39.620
Mitchell?

30:46.540 --> 30:48.411
Randall, get up.

30:48.498 --> 30:50.152
What? It's fine.

30:50.239 --> 30:52.024
It's not fine.
Turn the music down.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.678
Randall, where did Jane go?

30:54.765 --> 30:56.550
Uh... Outside, I think?

30:56.637 --> 30:57.899
I need to find her.

30:57.986 --> 31:00.162
She went out the front door.

31:04.427 --> 31:05.602
Jane!

31:05.689 --> 31:07.300
It smells.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.611
That stuff's really strong.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.865
I think they're really
fucked up.

31:50.952 --> 31:52.606
Who?

31:52.693 --> 31:53.955
Who do you think?

32:00.919 --> 32:03.095
This fog is insane.

32:18.719 --> 32:20.460
You smell that?

32:22.331 --> 32:23.463
What?

32:33.864 --> 32:35.954
I'm seeing sunspots.

32:37.129 --> 32:38.652
Jane!

32:38.739 --> 32:40.306
Relax.

32:40.393 --> 32:41.655
Jesus.

32:41.742 --> 32:43.135
Jane?

32:45.528 --> 32:47.313
Jane?

32:50.620 --> 32:52.144
Randall?

32:53.841 --> 32:55.625
What are you doing?

32:57.932 --> 32:59.542
I don't...

33:02.676 --> 33:04.199
I don't feel good.

34:02.997 --> 34:04.477
Randall?

34:04.564 --> 34:05.913
Hm?

37:06.006 --> 37:07.573
Randall...

37:07.660 --> 37:10.097
Hey, get up. It's past noon.

37:12.926 --> 37:14.232
How are you feeling?

37:14.319 --> 37:16.146
I'm fine.

37:18.540 --> 37:20.542
I feel like
I'm still stoned.

37:22.718 --> 37:25.504
I have this horrible
taste in my mouth.

37:27.593 --> 37:29.290
Is it hot out?

37:29.377 --> 37:30.726
I'm sweating.

37:30.813 --> 37:32.598
Yeah, it's hot out.

37:35.122 --> 37:36.819
It's beautiful, though.

37:38.430 --> 37:40.519
The fog's gone away.

37:43.173 --> 37:45.480
Should we go to the beach?

37:49.658 --> 37:53.183
Okay, I'm still a little
fucked up.

37:56.709 --> 37:58.450
Yeah.

38:00.887 --> 38:02.062
They were a mess.

38:02.149 --> 38:03.455
Really?

38:03.542 --> 38:04.630
Yeah.

38:05.805 --> 38:07.285
She was throwing up.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.766
And you fell asleep.

38:10.853 --> 38:12.812
I didn't think
they'd get so messed up.

38:14.466 --> 38:16.598
I thought they'd enjoy it.

38:16.685 --> 38:18.165
Really.

38:19.819 --> 38:22.865
Well, I'm... I'm glad
I brought my suit.

38:33.180 --> 38:36.357
Mrs. Turner,
how are you today?

38:44.234 --> 38:46.759
Um...

38:46.846 --> 38:48.717
You want some coffee?

38:53.069 --> 38:54.854
Are you okay?

39:02.252 --> 39:04.385
Do you need
your medication?

39:08.302 --> 39:09.738
Your pills.

39:23.404 --> 39:25.363
Mrs. Turner,
where's Mr. Turner?

39:29.105 --> 39:30.368
Where's Mitch?

39:34.894 --> 39:36.504
Mitch?

39:43.381 --> 39:45.165
Um, here, let me...

39:45.252 --> 39:46.558
Let me help you.

40:06.142 --> 40:07.622
Hello, Mrs. Turner.

40:15.848 --> 40:17.589
Um...

40:40.307 --> 40:41.700
Mitch!

40:43.571 --> 40:45.094
Mr. Turner!

40:57.542 --> 40:58.847
Let's go down.

41:18.780 --> 41:20.652
I don't think
he's down here.

41:22.001 --> 41:23.524
No one is.

41:26.266 --> 41:27.920
Mitch!

41:30.531 --> 41:32.620
Mr. Turner!

41:35.536 --> 41:37.364
Mitch!

41:56.470 --> 41:58.516
Why would he leave her?

41:58.603 --> 42:00.518
Seems fucking shitty.

42:01.823 --> 42:04.739
I'm sure he's somewhere close.

42:12.660 --> 42:14.357
Can we sit down
for a second?

42:14.444 --> 42:15.576
You okay?

42:15.663 --> 42:17.622
Yeah.

42:17.709 --> 42:21.147
It's just hot.

42:21.234 --> 42:22.975
And the air is so thick.

42:39.034 --> 42:40.993
Maybe he went swimming
somewhere.

43:39.007 --> 43:40.313
You all right?

43:40.400 --> 43:42.271
Yeah, I'm gonna go
back to the house.

43:42.358 --> 43:44.099
- Yeah?
- Yeah, like right now.

43:44.186 --> 43:46.058
- Well, I'll come with you.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

43:46.145 --> 43:48.277
I got to use the bathroom.
It's a guy thing.

43:48.364 --> 43:51.237
- Will you check on Mrs. Turner?
- Yeah. Sure.

43:52.847 --> 43:54.719
Are you sure
you're okay?

43:54.806 --> 43:56.634
Yeah, I'll be right back.

44:47.293 --> 44:49.687
Where is everyone?

44:52.646 --> 44:54.213
I've been wondering that.

44:59.871 --> 45:02.308
It was always so beautiful here,
but this time...

45:04.092 --> 45:05.485
I don't know.

45:05.572 --> 45:07.574
Something is off.

45:19.151 --> 45:20.761
Oh, come on, now.

45:34.688 --> 45:36.211
What the fuck?

45:49.355 --> 45:51.313
Mr. Turner?

45:57.102 --> 45:58.668
Mitch?

46:21.039 --> 46:24.129
The thing we liked about coming
here is, it was so comfortable.

46:25.173 --> 46:28.568
The same weather,
the same rooms,

46:28.655 --> 46:30.483
the same furniture.

46:30.570 --> 46:32.790
They're frozen in time.

46:36.619 --> 46:38.404
Jane loved it so much.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.931
We hadn't been in so long,
I just...

46:46.238 --> 46:49.807
I wanted her to have
one last special time.

46:52.766 --> 46:55.900
She could be so happy
on the beach.

47:02.602 --> 47:05.779
And when you see
someone change

47:05.866 --> 47:07.781
in front of you...

47:09.522 --> 47:12.917
and you know it won't
get any better,

47:13.004 --> 47:14.832
there's no going back.

47:19.967 --> 47:22.100
It scares me to death.

47:27.932 --> 47:29.455
How is she?

47:35.026 --> 47:37.202
We are so fortunate.

47:39.030 --> 47:42.120
It is so nice out today.

47:57.352 --> 47:59.050
Is everything okay?

48:00.703 --> 48:02.792
Fine, fine.

48:04.359 --> 48:06.448
Everything is fine.

48:10.975 --> 48:13.238
I think I'll go for a swim.

49:00.067 --> 49:02.809
Mr. Turner?

49:36.974 --> 49:38.932
Mitch!

49:52.337 --> 49:54.034
Mitch!

50:00.388 --> 50:01.868
Jane?

50:19.581 --> 50:21.148
Are you okay?

50:30.853 --> 50:32.333
Mrs. Turner?

50:34.074 --> 50:35.597
I'm coming inside.

50:36.816 --> 50:39.340
Tell me if you don't want me to.

50:53.615 --> 50:55.139
Mitch!

52:05.296 --> 52:06.558
Randall!

52:57.348 --> 52:58.740
Randall!

53:34.472 --> 53:37.518
Randall, where the fuck
are you?

56:18.549 --> 56:19.941
Randall?

56:21.465 --> 56:24.163
Hey. Hey, stop.
What are you doing?

56:24.250 --> 56:26.818
What's wrong with you? Hey.

56:33.085 --> 56:34.652
No, no.

56:54.585 --> 56:57.239
Hey, we have to go.
We have to go, all right?

56:58.502 --> 57:00.286
Get up, get up, get up, get up.

57:34.973 --> 57:36.496
Where are your keys?

57:37.802 --> 57:39.281
- I don't have them.
- What do you mean?

57:39.368 --> 57:40.935
They're not here!

57:42.850 --> 57:44.983
- God, what's wrong with her?
- Go! Just go!

57:49.988 --> 57:51.859
- This way.
- What?

57:51.946 --> 57:53.339
This way.

58:07.396 --> 58:09.442
Hello?

58:10.530 --> 58:12.619
Hello? We need help!

58:13.838 --> 58:14.969
Hello?

58:15.056 --> 58:16.362
I need a hospital.

58:19.147 --> 58:21.367
Oh, I'm fucked up.

58:22.847 --> 58:24.457
What is it?
Is it your stomach?

58:24.544 --> 58:26.415
No, it's everything.

58:35.120 --> 58:36.861
What did she do to you?

58:38.427 --> 58:40.517
I tried to help her.

58:45.609 --> 58:47.393
It's like I was knocked out.
I...

58:49.003 --> 58:50.701
I can't remember.

58:55.532 --> 58:57.403
We need a car.

58:59.840 --> 59:01.973
We need a car.
We need to get out of here.

59:02.060 --> 59:03.975
We need help.

59:04.062 --> 59:05.324
What is going on?

59:06.978 --> 59:08.545
I don't know.

59:13.462 --> 59:15.029
- What is it?
- Oh, fuck!

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.561
I can't breathe.

01:00:18.266 --> 01:00:19.877
Look. Look.

01:00:19.964 --> 01:00:21.487
What is it?

01:00:22.662 --> 01:00:24.664
A flashing light.

01:00:24.751 --> 01:00:27.058
Somebody's gonna be there.

01:00:27.145 --> 01:00:28.625
They have to be.

01:00:31.671 --> 01:00:33.194
We got to go.

01:00:56.261 --> 01:00:57.566
Okay.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.941
Okay...

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.773
Hello?

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:31.252
Is this the police?

01:01:34.603 --> 01:01:36.823
Is there anybody there?
We need help.

01:01:42.916 --> 01:01:45.049
We're... We're on Beach...

01:01:45.136 --> 01:01:46.790
Beachcomber Road.

01:01:46.877 --> 01:01:48.792
It's, um...
It's near the bend.

01:01:48.879 --> 01:01:50.576
It's, uh... I don't...

01:01:50.663 --> 01:01:52.621
I don't know the address.

01:01:54.101 --> 01:01:56.190
...hear you... near the water?

01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:58.976
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
It's on the ocean.

01:01:59.063 --> 01:02:01.152
Your... Your car is here.

01:02:01.239 --> 01:02:02.806
It's number, um...

01:02:02.893 --> 01:02:05.547
Um, I don't know.
I don't know the number.

01:02:05.634 --> 01:02:07.419
I don't know the number,
but we need help.

01:02:08.942 --> 01:02:10.335
...are extremely dangerous...

01:02:10.422 --> 01:02:12.250
What's extremely dangerous?

01:02:13.555 --> 01:02:14.687
...exposed.

01:02:14.774 --> 01:02:16.515
Everyone exposed.

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:20.954
Exposed to what?

01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:22.956
Get out of the car,
get indoors, lock yourself in.

01:02:23.043 --> 01:02:26.046
Seal the windows.
Don't breathe it.

01:02:26.133 --> 01:02:28.179
Breathe what?

01:02:28.266 --> 01:02:30.050
Is it the fog?

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.706
It's not fog.

01:02:36.622 --> 01:02:38.145
What is it?

01:02:39.494 --> 01:02:41.235
What is it?

01:02:41.322 --> 01:02:42.933
Hello?

01:02:45.544 --> 01:02:47.285
Hello? Please answer.

01:02:49.461 --> 01:02:51.942
Hello?

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.076
Randall?

01:03:00.167 --> 01:03:01.473
Randall!

01:03:07.653 --> 01:03:10.787
Randall. Are you okay?

01:03:14.355 --> 01:03:15.922
I was... I was thinking...

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:21.188
maybe it wasn't such a great
idea to come to the beach.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.800
Can you get up?

01:03:44.342 --> 01:03:46.126
Help!

01:03:48.215 --> 01:03:50.435
Okay, I need you
to give me a second, okay?

01:03:50.522 --> 01:03:52.132
Just give me one second.

01:04:40.659 --> 01:04:42.139
Hey.

01:04:42.226 --> 01:04:44.184
Jesus!

01:04:44.271 --> 01:04:45.403
Sorry.

01:04:47.274 --> 01:04:49.146
I'm feeling worse.
We need to get inside.

01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:56.980
I need you to cover your eyes,
okay?

01:04:57.067 --> 01:04:58.198
Shit.

01:05:10.819 --> 01:05:12.517
Can you get in?

01:05:12.604 --> 01:05:14.258
Okay, come on.

01:05:14.345 --> 01:05:15.781
Come on.

01:05:18.479 --> 01:05:21.091
One... two...

01:05:21.178 --> 01:05:22.483
three.

01:05:41.459 --> 01:05:42.939
You okay?

01:05:44.505 --> 01:05:46.029
I'm all right.

01:05:51.034 --> 01:05:53.514
Are you okay?
Are you all right?

01:05:53.601 --> 01:05:56.343
Look at me. Look at me.

01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:58.128
Are you okay?

01:06:13.665 --> 01:06:15.145
Hello?

01:06:20.498 --> 01:06:21.803
Em...

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.464
Come on.

01:06:40.866 --> 01:06:42.520
Well, that's a good thing.

01:06:44.783 --> 01:06:46.089
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:06:46.176 --> 01:06:47.351
Hold on.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.367
Hello? Is anyone there?

01:07:04.237 --> 01:07:06.239
It smells like rotten eggs.

01:07:15.596 --> 01:07:17.337
What happened here?

01:07:32.178 --> 01:07:33.484
Nothing.

01:07:35.529 --> 01:07:37.053
Damn it!

01:07:39.316 --> 01:07:41.448
Car keys. Car keys.
Car keys.

01:08:08.736 --> 01:08:10.086
They...

01:08:12.479 --> 01:08:15.178
They said it's not fog.
Maybe...

01:08:15.265 --> 01:08:18.398
Maybe it's something
from the water.

01:08:18.484 --> 01:08:20.183
An algae bloom.

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.794
A chemical spill
that's affecting the air.

01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:24.274
I...

01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:28.495
I don't know.

01:08:29.801 --> 01:08:31.455
We're fucked, right?

01:08:47.296 --> 01:08:49.081
Randall...

01:08:52.432 --> 01:08:53.999
Okay...

01:08:55.392 --> 01:08:56.479
Okay...

01:08:59.657 --> 01:09:02.529
It's okay. It's okay.

01:09:02.616 --> 01:09:05.140
Here. Here.

01:09:18.328 --> 01:09:19.416
What?

01:09:19.502 --> 01:09:21.243
The television.

01:09:33.517 --> 01:09:34.474
Uh-uh.

01:09:36.997 --> 01:09:39.087
I can feel it, like...

01:09:40.654 --> 01:09:42.439
churning inside.

01:10:00.065 --> 01:10:02.023
It's all the same.

01:10:03.851 --> 01:10:06.071
We're in fucking hell.

01:10:11.816 --> 01:10:13.644
The microbes
have been preserved in rock.

01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:15.167
- What is that?
- And the earth's heat

01:10:15.254 --> 01:10:16.908
free the bacterial form,

01:10:16.995 --> 01:10:18.214
- bubbling to the surface.
- It's a...

01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:20.216
It's an AM station.

01:10:21.739 --> 01:10:23.480
Someone's out there.

01:10:23.567 --> 01:10:25.612
...Oceanographic
Research Institute,

01:10:25.699 --> 01:10:29.225
located 41 degrees north,
54 minutes, 67 seconds.

01:10:38.756 --> 01:10:40.192
We are fucked.

01:10:40.279 --> 01:10:42.803
Well, if somebody's
broadcasting that,

01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:44.022
that mean that
there are others.

01:10:44.109 --> 01:10:45.241
We should...

01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:46.633
We should lock ourselves in

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.156
and seal the windows,

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:50.507
and we could just
wait until morning.

01:10:53.336 --> 01:10:54.728
I won't make that.

01:10:56.469 --> 01:10:57.775
No.

01:11:01.126 --> 01:11:03.607
I need you to hold on for me,
okay?

01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:05.652
I can't do this by myself.

01:11:07.001 --> 01:11:08.394
I've...

01:11:08.481 --> 01:11:11.615
I've wasted so much time
on shit.

01:11:15.009 --> 01:11:16.620
I'm scared.

01:11:20.188 --> 01:11:21.538
I'm so scared.

01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:22.713
It's okay.

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:31.069
Look at me. Hey.

01:11:33.463 --> 01:11:36.248
We have to keep going.

01:11:40.383 --> 01:11:42.036
Oh, God.

01:11:43.603 --> 01:11:45.039
I'm here.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:48.608
And I'm not leaving you.

01:11:53.004 --> 01:11:54.484
Don't be scared.

01:11:56.181 --> 01:11:58.096
Okay?

01:11:59.358 --> 01:12:01.665
I need you
to hold on for me.

01:12:03.667 --> 01:12:05.103
I'll try.

01:12:38.571 --> 01:12:42.314
...don't expire
when they succumb to the affliction.

01:12:42.401 --> 01:12:44.229
While life does not resemble

01:12:44.316 --> 01:12:45.622
what we have come
to understand,

01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:47.972
a complex carbon-based form

01:12:48.059 --> 01:12:49.626
has become something else.

01:13:52.689 --> 01:13:55.431
...until our planet becomes
like all others,

01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:57.520
an extinction event

01:13:57.607 --> 01:13:59.957
to all current complex
forms of life.

01:16:14.787 --> 01:16:16.397
Randall?

01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:23.579
We got to go now.
There's something down there.

01:16:51.955 --> 01:16:53.609
No!

01:20:17.551 --> 01:20:18.944
No!

01:21:20.136 --> 01:21:21.354
Ah!

01:24:29.107 --> 01:24:30.935
Don't be scared.

01:24:32.589 --> 01:24:34.156
Don't be scared.

01:24:35.418 --> 01:24:37.115
Don't be scared.

01:24:38.595 --> 01:24:40.249
Don't be scared.

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:44.079
Don't be scared.

01:25:01.993 --> 01:25:06.993
