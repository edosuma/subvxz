WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.480
MAN: This is to declare that
Jules Zemanik hereby owns

00:03.480 --> 00:06.280
2% of the LightWave surf company.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.040
WOMAN: I locked it.
Why?

00:09.040 --> 00:11.120
I saw you with Margaux, Trot,
so you know why.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.840
I'm having a baby.
This is amazing.

00:17.840 --> 00:20.000
This is just what we need.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.400
SHIRLEY: Mac did a drug deal
in Bali.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.560
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

00:22.560 --> 00:24.080
Trot, Mac killed someone.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.080
I can't pay you for this.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.720
Mate, what are friends for?

00:27.720 --> 00:29.360
Arthur Foreman.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.120
I do want to talk to you
about a bigger investment

00:31.120 --> 00:32.320
than just a sponsorship.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.600
Don't you think it's time
surfers started making some money?

00:34.600 --> 00:36.840
You never used to care
about the money, Snap!

00:36.840 --> 00:38.080
You're not selling?

00:38.080 --> 00:41.360
You seem like a decent guy,
but you're just not that salty.

01:54.440 --> 01:57.760
MAC: Thousand ways to kneel
and kiss the ground.

01:57.760 --> 02:01.600
Thousand ways to go home again.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.880
Rumi. The master.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.480
Wise, wise man. (LAUGHS)

02:08.480 --> 02:09.680
Yeah!

02:11.280 --> 02:12.760
Mac.
Yeah?

02:12.760 --> 02:15.600
Mate, it's never an easy decision
to leave paradise.

02:16.640 --> 02:17.800
I can imagine.

02:17.800 --> 02:18.840
Wait.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.160
YOU can?

02:23.400 --> 02:25.040
I genuinely can't, mate.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.160
Yeah.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.720
Ugh. Colder than a witch's tit here,
mate.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.040
I don't know how you stand it.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.920
Oh, Jesus.

02:35.960 --> 02:39.800
So, uh...
what brings you to our fine town?

02:39.800 --> 02:41.320
What?

02:41.320 --> 02:43.000
Oh...

02:43.000 --> 02:45.840
Just had to get out of Bali
for a while, you know?

02:45.840 --> 02:49.720
It'll wash over, it's nothing,
but, ah,

02:49.720 --> 02:52.080
just felt like a good time
to be back here.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.600
You don't mind if I crash here
for a while, do you?

02:55.440 --> 02:57.440
(GLASS CLINKS)

02:59.520 --> 03:00.520
Course not.

03:00.520 --> 03:05.440
Oh, mate, that is such good news.

03:05.440 --> 03:09.160
You know, I was wondering,
who owes ME something?

03:10.560 --> 03:17.200
And you appeared,
like a stallion or a gladiator,

03:17.200 --> 03:20.480
rising through the mists
of the ancient world.

03:21.640 --> 03:24.360
To give you a place to stay?

03:24.360 --> 03:25.360
Yeah.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.560
For now.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.040
TRACY: Jules, you could follow
your own dreams.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.360
Look, if you come on board,

03:49.360 --> 03:52.280
Foreman will give us more money than
we've ever seen in our whole lives.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.760
Trotter will never sell.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.440
He doesn't have to sell.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.680
He just gets a new business partner.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.000
And so why do you need me?

04:00.640 --> 04:03.440
Foreman needs 51% of the company
to make the deal,

04:03.440 --> 04:06.720
and together,
we're the majority shareholders.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.880
Jules,

04:10.880 --> 04:12.440
you and I have been
the silent partners

04:12.440 --> 04:14.400
in Trot's ego show for too long.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.640
It's time we take what's ours
and move on.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.800
This is all pretty sudden, Trace.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.480
What happens if you and Trot
get back together?

04:23.760 --> 04:25.040
That's not happening.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.280
WOMAN: She deserves an explanation.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.800
TROTTER: Not from you.
I don't know, I feel bad.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.200
It's not your business.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.320
Don't be mad at me, Trotter.
We were both there.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.400
Yeah, you think I'm not paying
for that?

04:39.400 --> 04:40.920
What are you gonna do?

04:44.560 --> 04:45.920
Keep trying.

04:50.160 --> 04:53.600
Look, please, don't speak to Tracy.
Yeah, I'll stay out of your way.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.000
(SQUEAKING)
(SIGHS)

05:13.960 --> 05:15.240
Hey, Dad.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.320
Bit of a mess, hey?

05:21.640 --> 05:24.680
People are talking, love.
Oh, yeah?

05:24.680 --> 05:25.800
Yeah. They, ah...

05:26.720 --> 05:29.040
They reckon no-one would've done
that unless there was truth in it.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.600
Is that right?

05:33.920 --> 05:35.760
So is it true?

05:35.760 --> 05:37.600
Does it matter?
Yeah, well, it matters to me.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.440
If it is, this isn't the way
I wanted to tell you.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.880
How could you be so stupid?

05:56.880 --> 05:59.640
You don't think I've tried
to keep it a secret?

05:59.640 --> 06:01.400
It's not like I did this
to my own shop.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.880
No, no,
you brought this on yourself.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.560
Thanks for the support, Dad.
No, no, you need to stop.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.360
It's not natural, love.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.840
I mean, what about babies
and marriage?

06:12.960 --> 06:14.480
You'll never be able
to live a normal life.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.320
What do you think this is?

06:16.320 --> 06:18.240
It's what I'm trying to do, Dad.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.200
I stayed here, didn't I?

06:21.200 --> 06:22.440
You stayed here for your friends.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.840
And for you.

06:28.840 --> 06:32.040
I'm just glad your mother's
not alive to see that.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.480
Dad.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.400
Dad!

06:47.400 --> 06:50.520
(CRIES)

06:55.360 --> 06:57.200
Who'd you tell?

06:57.200 --> 06:58.440
Don't act like you don't know.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.160
You were the only one
who knew anything about me,

07:00.160 --> 07:02.480
and now there's 'lezzo'
written across my shop window.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.720
Shit.
Yeah, bloody right it's shit.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.040
Who'd you tell?
No-one.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.240
My dad saw it.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.520
You talk to him?
Oh, yeah.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.440
He's disowned me now,
so thanks for that.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.400
It wasn't me, Dani.
Yeah, I'm not saying that.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.280
But this story got out somehow.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.280
Dani.
No!

07:23.280 --> 07:24.480
I don't trust you anymore.

07:29.520 --> 07:32.400
SNAPPER: Hey. How about
we reconvene tomorrow, hmm?

07:32.400 --> 07:34.840
Well, what about the new shorts?
Ah, they're not quite ready.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.640
They look ripper, Snap. I like them.
Nah.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.680
Just need a little bit more time
to finish my thoughts, you know?

07:39.680 --> 07:41.560
Are you really saying no
to another day off?

07:41.560 --> 07:44.520
Come on, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.440
MAC: Hey, that China White I gave
you really helped you set things up,

07:55.440 --> 07:57.280
huh?

07:57.280 --> 08:00.320
That actually cost me a lot more
than it gave me in the end.

08:01.720 --> 08:04.840
Oh, if you spill from the cup
that is giveth with love...

08:05.880 --> 08:07.400
..the wine must still be shared.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.440
What is that, more Rumi?

08:09.440 --> 08:12.520
Hey? I just made that up.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.280
Can't believe it. That's mine.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.400
Have you got a pencil?
I've got to write this down.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.160
Oh, that's my favourite.
Oh, this thing.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.360
So you want me to pay for the smack?

08:24.480 --> 08:25.920
Well, yeah.

08:27.120 --> 08:30.440
But the question is,
what's it worth?

08:44.800 --> 08:46.280
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

08:50.800 --> 08:52.760
Can I break the rules?

08:55.480 --> 08:59.600
I made a big deal about no strings
and sex and everything,

08:59.600 --> 09:02.480
but we need to talk.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.080
I won't tell if you don't.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.520
The whole world's gone mad.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.520
Yes, it has.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.360
Tracy wants to sell LightWave.

09:18.720 --> 09:19.960
There's money about.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.080
Changes people.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.080
Do you think it would change me?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.560
I don't think so.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.560
I mean, it might be nice to get to
make my own decisions, for a change.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.840
Yeah?

09:40.240 --> 09:42.120
You know, I've been thinking about
doing the same thing.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.520
MERV: It's a lot of money.

10:02.480 --> 10:06.000
Sold the license for LightWave US.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.840
All that for your little
boardshort business?

10:07.840 --> 10:10.240
That's just the start.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.960
Who'd have thought?

10:11.960 --> 10:14.080
I guess you'll be paying the house
off now.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.680
Nice piece of real estate.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.600
Needs a bit of work, I hear.

10:21.960 --> 10:25.120
Let's not pay for that house
just yet, Merv.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.320
It's your money.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.920
How's it feel to be rich?

10:33.920 --> 10:35.160
Fantastic.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.720
OK. I'm in.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.760
Really?

10:49.880 --> 10:51.120
Think so.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.360
Yes.

10:56.360 --> 10:57.840
You won't regret this, Jules.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.000
Need me to stay?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.840
You're alright.
OK.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.960
Trot.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.160
Look, Trace, I...

11:27.280 --> 11:33.200
The, ah... The US license money
came in this morning.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.480
That's good news.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.320
It'll make the company
more attractive.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.440
In what way?

11:40.440 --> 11:42.360
You know Arthur Foreman?

11:42.360 --> 11:44.720
The idiot who wanted to buy
Bare Feet?

11:44.720 --> 11:46.480
Yeah.
(CHUCKLES)

11:48.240 --> 11:50.120
Well, now he wants to buy LightWave.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.280
Well, I'm not selling.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.160
As long as he gets a majority share,
he's happy.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.720
And Jules and I have agreed
to sell our shares.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.280
Oh.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.680
No, this is too much, Trace.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.560
Really?

12:11.560 --> 12:12.840
Which part?

12:12.840 --> 12:14.480
You ruining everything

12:14.480 --> 12:16.840
or me trying to salvage something
back for myself?

12:16.840 --> 12:18.440
You're not selling my company.

12:18.440 --> 12:19.960
It's OURS.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.800
And I'll do what I like
with my share.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.080
Well, I'm not letting this happen.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.120
You don't fight for our marriage,
but you fight for this?

12:25.120 --> 12:27.560
Because this is wrong, Trace.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.960
Hey. This is amazing.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.080
It's a disaster.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.840
What's going on?

12:45.840 --> 12:48.200
Oh, just the whole town now knows
that I'm a lezzo.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.120
Why would you use that word?

12:51.120 --> 12:53.600
'Cause it's the word I just
scraped off my shop window.

12:55.560 --> 12:59.000
Oh, Dani.
Don't "Oh, Dani" me.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.200
Someone must have seen us together.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.760
Yeah, well, I'm not ashamed of that.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.480
Yeah, 'cause you don't have
to live here.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.520
OK.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.720
You're angry.
Yeah, I'm furious!

13:08.720 --> 13:10.320
Everything is going to shit!

13:10.320 --> 13:11.440
Only if you let it.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.280
That is so easy for you to say,
Shirley.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.680
Actually...it's not.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.960
Shirley?

13:36.960 --> 13:38.760
(CLANK!)

13:38.760 --> 13:40.000
Snap.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.400
Hey, Reggie.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.840
Let's talk outside, yeah?
Why?

13:42.840 --> 13:44.360
Just, come on. Let's go talk.
No.

13:44.360 --> 13:45.960
What?
I need to say this.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.160
I don't wanna make boards
for Bare Feet anymore.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.680
It's time I did my own thing.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.480
MAC: About time, Reginald.

14:01.720 --> 14:08.120
We can never truly know freedom
until we own our own destiny, right?

14:08.120 --> 14:09.160
(CHUCKLES)

14:10.240 --> 14:12.160
What's he doing here?

14:12.160 --> 14:13.280
(QUIETLY) I didn't invite him.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.840
Why didn't you just sell out if this
was how you're gonna make money?

14:15.840 --> 14:17.680
It's not what it looks like.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.600
He's just helping out an old mate.

14:22.840 --> 14:23.920
Isn't that right, Snap?

14:26.160 --> 14:27.200
Oh.

14:27.200 --> 14:32.320
Buddy was talking about those
Blue Meanies in the back paddock.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.440
I should get some.

14:36.760 --> 14:39.280
I'm just gonna go for a forage.

14:42.120 --> 14:45.800
Only from the heart
can we really touch the sky.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.400
Oh, Reg.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.760
If I find some mushies, you're in.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.200
(CHUCKLES)

14:57.920 --> 14:59.560
What the hell?

15:00.760 --> 15:02.160
He just showed up.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.040
He wants runaway money.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.520
So give it to him.

15:09.360 --> 15:13.640
I don't...have any.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.880
You shouldn't have taken the smack.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.120
Do you think I don't know that? Huh?

15:19.200 --> 15:23.200
That I don't pay for that deal, which
I got nothing from, by the way,

15:23.200 --> 15:25.600
every single day?

15:26.720 --> 15:27.920
Karma's a bitch.

15:29.640 --> 15:33.200
Yeah. Yeah, OK. Yeah,
I brought it all on myself, huh?

15:34.360 --> 15:35.920
What do you want from me, Reg?

15:38.240 --> 15:39.960
I don't know, Snap.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.560
Maybe this is a sign, brother.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.440
It's all over.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.960
How long have we known each other?
It's not about you, Trot.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.040
Please, don't do this.
I need the money.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.400
So hang in there, OK?

16:03.400 --> 16:05.760
The bigger we grow,
the more you'll have.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.280
I'm tired of waiting. I'm selling.

16:08.280 --> 16:09.560
Where were you before you came here?

16:10.640 --> 16:13.600
Running round the back rooms of
Zemaniks, hiding from your old man,

16:13.600 --> 16:15.080
waiting for him to marry you off.

16:15.080 --> 16:18.280
You treat me the same way he did.
"Do this, Jules." "Do that, Jules."

16:18.280 --> 16:20.120
You never ask me
what I think about anything.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.800
That's bullshit.
BARRY: Hey.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.360
Hey, settle down, mate.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.320
He's alright, Barry.
(SIGHS)

16:25.320 --> 16:26.440
Look at me.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.400
I am still working here
and for you guys.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.120
You know,
when do I get what I deserve?

16:30.120 --> 16:32.440
You wouldn't even have your precious
LightWave if it wasn't for me.

16:32.440 --> 16:33.880
Yeah, I know that, I know.

16:33.880 --> 16:37.520
But the US money has just come
through. It is happening, Jules.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.560
Really? Where's my share?

16:40.960 --> 16:43.560
You know we've got debts.
And now the wetsuits...

16:43.560 --> 16:46.640
Yeah, and your new house.
It's all about you.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.000
I'm not even an afterthought.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.840
This sale gives me a chance
to do something for myself.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.040
I'm sorry, I'm taking it.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.200
You're not selling my company.
Alright, that's enough, Trot.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.280
Hey, I'm just gonna talk to her,
Barry. I'm just talking to her.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.920
You don't want another
smack in the head, boy.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.800
Don't do this, Jules.

17:10.280 --> 17:13.800
I wish Hunter had just given us
a dress code. Maybe this is too much.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.920
Overdressing is worse than
underdressing with these people.

17:19.600 --> 17:20.880
What do you think?

17:22.320 --> 17:23.640
Bud!

17:23.640 --> 17:25.680
Wake up.

17:25.680 --> 17:26.880
(COUGHS)

17:26.880 --> 17:28.880
What the hell is wrong with you?

17:28.880 --> 17:31.160
Oh. Sorry, baby. It...

17:31.160 --> 17:33.960
Why are you doing this?

17:33.960 --> 17:36.720
You promised.
I love you, Kell.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.840
Well, that's good news,
because I'm about to...

17:40.840 --> 17:42.600
Fuck! Fuck.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.920
HUNTER: You guys ready?

17:43.920 --> 17:45.680
Coming!

17:46.840 --> 17:48.200
Bud, get it together.

17:53.480 --> 17:55.120
Oh...

17:56.760 --> 17:59.240
Hi, guys.
Oh, my God, Kelly, you look amazing.

17:59.240 --> 18:01.600
I wish I could pull off that look.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.320
You always look beautiful.

18:03.320 --> 18:06.200
Are you sure your mum's
going to be OK with this?

18:06.200 --> 18:08.200
Well, I mean, she invited you,
didn't she?

18:09.280 --> 18:10.720
Bud, what are you doing?

18:10.720 --> 18:13.160
How can he possibly take longer
to get ready

18:13.160 --> 18:15.600
than these two fine women
put together?

18:15.600 --> 18:18.080
You know how he is.
Every outfit's an adventure.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.320
Right, well, I'll go flush him out.
No, no, no, no.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.640
I'll go.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.640
Hey, hey, hey.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.440
Can't a man take a shower in peace?
Huh?

18:29.440 --> 18:30.520
Give me five.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.720
I know exactly what I'm gonna wear
to meet the rich.

18:38.400 --> 18:42.320
Hey, ah, we're all good, right?

18:42.320 --> 18:44.520
That interview, I know it was lame.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.520
No, you were just doing
what you do best.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.000
That's why we're a team, huh?

18:49.320 --> 18:51.120
Thanks, man.
Let's do this.

18:51.120 --> 18:54.640
Mum, Dad, you remember, ah...
Kelly Fox?

18:54.640 --> 18:57.720
And, ah, this is my business
partner, Buddy Fraser.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.440
Hi.
Have you sued us yet?

19:00.440 --> 19:03.160
I'm so sorry about last time,
Mrs Hunter.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.880
Call me Marilyn.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.680
I've played a few pranks in my time.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.440
Champagne?
Yes, I'll pour.

19:10.440 --> 19:14.360
So, Bud, what business
is your old man in?

19:14.360 --> 19:16.000
Oh...
Dad.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.200
Well, he's...

19:18.320 --> 19:19.560
Liquor exports.

19:19.560 --> 19:23.360
Well, more import than export,
if you get what I mean.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.920
Oh.

19:24.920 --> 19:28.360
Well, in that case, are you drinking
champagne or whiskey?

19:28.360 --> 19:30.600
I'll leave the champagne
for the ladies, huh?

19:30.600 --> 19:32.560
Hmm.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.360
That one always goes
for the champagne.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.480
No, I'll take a whiskey.

19:38.480 --> 19:40.480
Only because you're here, Buddy.

19:40.480 --> 19:44.520
Um, we've been drinking champagne
all week. (LAUGHS)

19:44.520 --> 19:46.040
I'm having a baby.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.680
I was three months gone
with Bernie's brother

19:49.680 --> 19:51.760
when his father and I got married.

19:51.760 --> 19:56.440
I carried a very large bouquet and
everyone pretended not to notice.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.520
I didn't know that
Bernie had a brother.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.320
He passed a long time ago.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.240
I'm so sorry.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.280
To new beginnings all around.

20:07.280 --> 20:10.000
(ALL LAUGH)
Cheers.

20:11.160 --> 20:13.240
Ah, sorry, where's your bathroom?

20:13.240 --> 20:17.160
It's up the stairs
and first door to the right.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.320
Thanks.
Should I come with you?

20:19.320 --> 20:20.720
No, babe.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.840
I remember when my wife used
to look at me like that.

20:26.840 --> 20:29.040
A long, long time ago.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.360

Chester told me he'd be able to
renegotiate for you any time.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.200
HUNTER: We're doing OK, Dad.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.600
We've got a lot of goodwill
from the Australian connection.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.920
Oh, no, you need your own identity.

21:19.920 --> 21:23.400
Well, Buddy is the American face
of the brand. Isn't that right, Bud?

Dude, your dad is an asshole.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.080
He didn't mean that.
I did.

21:52.080 --> 21:54.240
Why do you let him talk to you
like that?

21:54.240 --> 21:55.640
This is his house.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.880
You just went facedown in your soup.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.240
Yeah, we've already broken you out
of this prison once before,

22:00.240 --> 22:02.720
and, what, you just...
you come crawling back in?

22:02.720 --> 22:04.200
Bud, stop.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.680
Look at this place.

22:06.680 --> 22:10.480
No matter how hard you try to
slum it with us, you're always...

22:10.480 --> 22:12.800
You're gonna be Newport.

22:14.160 --> 22:17.240
Well, at least I do something, Bud.
You'll always just be a face.

22:18.680 --> 22:22.160
What about the money that
I got you for Trotter and Gina?

22:22.160 --> 22:23.760
This face got you that.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.480
Hmm.

22:25.480 --> 22:27.240
One grand gesture and you can, ah,

22:27.240 --> 22:29.240
go back to taking drugs
and ruining Kelly's life.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.720
I'll speak for myself.

22:31.720 --> 22:34.240
You have no idea
what I've done for you.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.480
Isn't that your car?

to keep our head above water

it's all too much

23:27.840 --> 23:30.120
I was just checking
if you got all that cash from Buddy.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.440
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

23:34.440 --> 23:37.480
I know what you did in Bali!
What?

23:37.480 --> 23:39.320
Oh... Oh, that.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.600
You're an animal.

23:42.600 --> 23:47.560
Yeah, but if you tell anyone then
I guess all this just disappears.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.880
(LAUGHS)

23:50.600 --> 23:51.880
What?

23:53.480 --> 23:54.760
I'll see you fellas out there.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.880
He's lost his marbles.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.080
You know he killed someone?

24:05.080 --> 24:06.400
What?

24:08.720 --> 24:11.160
So that's what he's running from?
I've had enough of this.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.600

Get rid of him.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.480

Did your bank not get the wire?

24:55.480 --> 24:57.080
I'm not taking your blood money.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.000
I...I have no idea
what you're talking about.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.960
As if you don't know what
happened in Bali, Newbie.

25:15.360 --> 25:18.000
Listen, about today...
Did Mac kill someone in Bali?

25:22.520 --> 25:25.600
Trotter says you were the one
who got rid of the body.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.520
Yeah, well, you knew
what was happening in Bali.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.360
Not this, Buddy. This, this...

25:35.360 --> 25:37.040
Well, I'm the one
who has to live with it...

25:37.040 --> 25:38.440
Oh, really?
..Hunter.

25:38.440 --> 25:41.320
Really? What happens
when this story gets out?

25:41.320 --> 25:43.240
It won't.
Well, it already has.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.560
Trotter just cancelled
the LightWave license.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.120
No, no, no, no, no,
he can't do that.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.800
We've paid it.
Listen to me.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.360
You bring chaos everywhere you go.

25:53.360 --> 25:56.560
And you just expect that
I'll clean up after you, don't you?

25:56.560 --> 25:58.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
I'M the fuck-up.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.400
Just blame everything on me.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.880
I can't do this anymore, Bud.

26:08.120 --> 26:10.120
I... I'm... I'm done.

26:10.120 --> 26:13.640
I'm... We're done. We're done.

The guy's a junkie.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.080
# And the bottom's all empty... #

26:51.080 --> 26:52.640
MARILYN: He is.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.360
# And I though of you... #

26:56.360 --> 27:00.520
Family are the only people that you
should ever go into business with.

27:00.520 --> 27:03.080

# Time stands still

# But the world keeps
spinning around... #

27:15.160 --> 27:17.360

27:17.360 --> 27:20.840
# Time stands still

27:22.560 --> 27:27.320
# It's hard to keep your feet
on the ground... #

27:27.320 --> 27:29.080
Just tell us what you need.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.880
# Fallen on the train tracks

27:35.800 --> 27:39.480
# Laid red autumn leaves

during the day.

Not for much longer, I hear.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.280

28:51.440 --> 28:53.040
Don't sell, Trace.

28:55.840 --> 28:57.400
If I sell, you've won.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.680
Isn't this what you want?

29:00.680 --> 29:01.680
Not like this.

29:14.160 --> 29:15.480
Not like this.

29:17.440 --> 29:19.720

cheap rip-offs

29:24.960 --> 29:26.320
So now you're better than me?

29:27.600 --> 29:28.640
That?

29:32.480 --> 29:33.480
Never.

29:45.480 --> 29:47.240
About the other night...

29:50.000 --> 29:53.160
It's fine, Trace. I...
I know what you're gonna say.

29:54.440 --> 29:56.200
I just want to say thank you.

29:58.440 --> 29:59.560
For listening.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.960
Don't throw everything away
just because you're hurting.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.040
That happens to the best of us.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.480
WOMAN: Are my family gonna find
my decomposed body here, Dim?

30:34.800 --> 30:37.160
DIMMA: That's a bit gruesome.
I read a lot of mysteries.

30:39.480 --> 30:41.720
(CHUCKLES) Homely.

30:43.320 --> 30:45.360
Oh, this is stupid.
We don't have to stay here.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.480
I like it.

30:54.120 --> 30:57.240
So...what's the story?

31:02.080 --> 31:04.560
I come here
when I'm sick of everyone.

31:06.520 --> 31:07.560
Your mum died, didn't she?

31:12.280 --> 31:13.840
That sucks.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.040
I wouldn't know how to look
after a baby.

31:33.440 --> 31:35.600
My mum reckons I should give it up.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.640
Will you?

31:45.520 --> 31:48.120
Well, you can come here
anytime you need to.

31:49.560 --> 31:51.440
Will you be here?

31:54.040 --> 31:55.320
Probably.

31:59.840 --> 32:04.240
# Don't you have some loving
for me, honey?

32:04.240 --> 32:07.920
# Would you give it some thought?

32:09.320 --> 32:14.160
# I ain't a man to be unkind
to a woman

32:14.160 --> 32:16.160
# I ain't got it in

# I ain't got it in my heart... #

32:19.680 --> 32:21.040
Hm.

Hey, Snap.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.120
This is the life, hey?

32:34.200 --> 32:36.600
How long are you gonna keep me
locked up in here for?

32:36.600 --> 32:38.400
You're not locked up, mate.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.160
Fly, oh, fly, my soul bird.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.240
Feel it. In here.

32:49.640 --> 32:53.320
Can't you just give me my money
and I'll just fly away?

32:56.080 --> 32:57.440
How much are we talking?

33:00.120 --> 33:01.560
How do you put a price on freedom?

33:03.120 --> 33:04.760
Oh. Hang on.

33:09.800 --> 33:12.400
You didn't tell me Bare Feet
was worth this much.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.880
It's not. I didn't sell.

33:14.880 --> 33:15.880
Still...

33:18.240 --> 33:21.120
Why don't we say ten grand?

33:22.280 --> 33:23.680
Then we're square.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.640
I don't have that kinda cash, mate.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.200
Here's the thing.

33:30.200 --> 33:33.840
Either you give me the money
to get outta here...

33:36.480 --> 33:37.760
..or I'm just gonna take it...

33:40.120 --> 33:41.560

Are you kidding me, mate?

34:29.720 --> 34:32.680
I wear lezzo on my face
all the bloody time, Dani.

34:34.560 --> 34:36.520
Shit, Reg, I'm sorry.

34:42.640 --> 34:44.840
Whenever people would meet
my parents,

34:44.840 --> 34:46.440
they'd always look past me...

34:47.840 --> 34:50.360
..never think that I belonged
to them.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.000
And I wonder...

34:54.520 --> 34:56.000
..sometimes that's what
they thought.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.920
Like I was some stray
that they picked up

34:59.920 --> 35:01.040
and now they're stuck with me.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.720
No, Reg.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.560
Nobody could hassle you as much
as they do and not love you.

35:08.640 --> 35:09.840
You'd know all about that.

You're not alone, Dani.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.400
Shirley says I should just be
who I am,

where to start.

What, you too?
What do you mean?

36:20.880 --> 36:24.680
I'm just getting a beer.
Great. Who else did you tell?

36:26.080 --> 36:27.320
I'm here for you too.

get around town

This isn't the place.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.640

All of you know that someone wrote
a word on my new shop window...

37:22.080 --> 37:24.320
..and I bet some of you thought
it was pretty bloody funny.

37:26.760 --> 37:27.840
Well, guess what.

37:29.240 --> 37:30.800
I am a lezzo.

37:32.440 --> 37:34.880
But I grew up in this town.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.280
And I'm the same person today
as I was yesterday.

37:37.280 --> 37:39.200
And if that word is the best
you can do for me,

37:39.200 --> 37:40.600

I'm not going anywhere,
and I'm not changing who I am.

have a problem with it,

48:49.200 --> 48:50.720
After this you're gonna be
a very rich man.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.200
Hmm.

48:52.200 --> 48:57.560
And now that we're all present...
shall we?

49:00.840 --> 49:03.720
I don't wanna be in any kind
of partnership with you anymore.

49:14.280 --> 49:15.800
Congratulations, Arthur.

49:15.800 --> 49:17.280
You've just bought
half of LightWave.

49:17.280 --> 49:19.080
Yeah, well, not quite.

49:19.080 --> 49:22.280
We still need Jules and her 2%.

49:25.640 --> 49:29.280
Before you sign that, Jules, there
is something I should tell you all.

49:31.200 --> 49:33.320
We don't have a US licence deal
anymore.

49:33.320 --> 49:39.520
(LAUGHS)
You said that money came through.

49:39.520 --> 49:42.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yep,
but then I cancelled it.

49:42.240 --> 49:44.240
Why?
Doesn't matter why.

49:44.240 --> 49:46.040
It's happened.

49:46.040 --> 49:48.680
But due diligence, mate.

49:48.680 --> 49:54.480
There is no US licence and I don't
have the money to pay them back.

49:55.600 --> 49:59.000
I mean, I just spent a shit-ton
of money that we really don't have

49:59.000 --> 50:00.880
on a rubber deal.

50:00.880 --> 50:04.080
Oh, and I'm probably gonna lose
the deposit on a house.

50:04.080 --> 50:07.080
I mean, you were right
about Dumbo, Trace.

50:08.280 --> 50:10.000
We couldn't afford it.

50:12.680 --> 50:15.400
I wish I could let you buy us
out of this hole...

50:17.520 --> 50:20.320
..but I just...I just can't
let you spend all that money

50:20.320 --> 50:23.520
without being totally honest
about our financial situation.

50:26.560 --> 50:28.160
Well.

50:31.520 --> 50:33.200
That's me done.

50:43.280 --> 50:45.120
You know, next time
you make a decision

50:45.120 --> 50:46.400
without your husband's permission,

50:46.400 --> 50:48.160
call someone else, OK?

50:48.160 --> 50:49.600
Ah, yeah, rack off, mate.

50:50.840 --> 50:52.400
Thank you.

50:57.280 --> 51:00.280
Well, I guess both of you
need my 2% now.

51:08.320 --> 51:10.680
For better or for worse,
right, Trace?

51:10.680 --> 51:12.280
Fuck off, Trot.

51:22.040 --> 51:23.960
Way I see it...

51:26.560 --> 51:32.440
..you can climb the mountain
by yourself, see the view,

51:32.440 --> 51:35.880
go back and tell your friends
about it...

51:37.800 --> 51:42.640
..or you could climb that mountain
together, see that view

51:42.640 --> 51:47.240
and talk about it
with your friends, forever.

51:48.840 --> 51:51.120
Am I the mountain or the view?

51:51.120 --> 51:56.080
Oh, mate,
you are definitely the view.

52:06.880 --> 52:11.880
If I stay, Snap, the only boards
coming out of this shed are mine.

52:15.720 --> 52:17.840
I wouldn't want it any other way.

52:20.120 --> 52:22.240
(PHONE RINGS)

52:22.240 --> 52:23.840
LightWave.

52:23.840 --> 52:26.520
Trotter.
Newbie.

52:26.520 --> 52:28.240
You can't cancel the contract.

52:28.240 --> 52:30.920
Ah, I'm sorry, mate, I have to.

52:30.920 --> 52:33.560
It's not how we do business.

52:33.560 --> 52:36.160
Don't worry, we'll find a way
to get you your money.

52:36.160 --> 52:38.160
No, I mean, you can't.

52:38.160 --> 52:40.360
I'm keeping the licence.

52:40.360 --> 52:41.720
You?

52:41.720 --> 52:44.120
I've had my lawyers
look at the contract.

52:44.120 --> 52:46.920
We paid you and it's watertight.

52:46.920 --> 52:52.120
And if you try and stop me, I will
tie you up in the court so long

52:52.120 --> 52:54.560
you'll be left with
absolutely nothing.

52:54.560 --> 52:55.800
Newbie.

52:55.800 --> 52:59.880
The name's Hunter
and I'm gonna make LightWave USA

52:59.880 --> 53:02.040
the most successful surf brand
in the world.

53:03.840 --> 53:06.160
It's just like I said way back
when we met.

53:07.640 --> 53:09.800
You and I could make a lot of money.

53:10.920 --> 53:16.760
We're barons, my friend, and either
you rule this world with me...

53:18.760 --> 53:20.680
..or I'm gonna rule it on my own.

53:22.600 --> 53:24.400
So...

53:24.400 --> 53:27.240
..what's it gonna be?

53:27.240 --> 53:30.840
# I am Pegasus

53:30.840 --> 53:33.240
# My name means horse

53:33.240 --> 53:38.440
# And I can fly with you

53:38.440 --> 53:40.880
# But I've changed my course

53:40.880 --> 53:43.120
# I am Michael

53:43.120 --> 53:47.280
# I am Jeffrey and John

53:48.560 --> 53:51.160
# And I don't have to leave you

53:52.360 --> 53:54.680
# But I shall be gone

53:57.480 --> 54:00.480
# I am Genesis

54:00.480 --> 54:02.920
# I have no fear

54:04.240 --> 54:08.000
# I make my plans to land for

54:08.000 --> 54:10.880
# I plan to stay here

54:10.880 --> 54:12.640
# I am Simon

54:13.800 --> 54:17.160
# I am Demetrius and John

54:17.160 --> 54:20.760
# And I don't want to leave you

54:20.760 --> 54:23.560
# Unless you want me gone

54:23.560 --> 54:26.480
# I am flying

54:26.480 --> 54:28.800
# But let me down

54:30.720 --> 54:34.080
# I don't need the things

54:34.080 --> 54:36.440
# That once kept me around

54:36.440 --> 54:38.400
# It's not too late

54:38.400 --> 54:42.920
# Do you know who I am?

54:42.920 --> 54:45.960
# I am Pegasus

54:45.960 --> 54:48.680
# My name means horse

54:48.680 --> 54:53.440
# And I can fly with you now

54:53.440 --> 54:56.120
# But I changed my course

54:56.120 --> 54:58.280
# I am Michael

54:58.280 --> 55:02.320
# I am Jeffery and John

55:02.320 --> 55:06.120
# And I don't have to leave you

55:08.520 --> 55:11.480
# I am Pegasus

55:11.480 --> 55:13.880
# My name means horse

55:15.160 --> 55:18.840
# I can fly with you now

55:18.840 --> 55:21.440
# But I've changed my course

55:21.440 --> 55:23.040
# I am Michael

55:23.040 --> 55:27.320
# I am Jeffrey,
I am Demetrius and John

55:28.320 --> 55:31.480
# And I don't have to leave you, no

55:31.480 --> 55:33.920
# No, no, no, no

55:33.920 --> 55:37.360
# I am Pegasus and Genesis

55:37.360 --> 55:40.040
# My name means horse

55:40.040 --> 55:43.920
# And I can fly with you now

55:43.920 --> 55:46.360
# But I've changed, changed, changed

55:46.360 --> 55:48.440
# I am Michael

55:48.440 --> 55:52.200
# I am Jeffrey,
I am Demetrius and John

55:52.200 --> 55:55.480
# And I don't have to leave you
