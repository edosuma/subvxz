WEBVTT

00:02.915 --> 00:05.440
HANA: Previously on Mars.

00:07.224 --> 00:13.317
ELON: Getting to Mars will
be the greatest adventure
ever, ever in human history.

00:13.361 --> 00:17.060
HANA: With the
science of innovators
who came before us,

00:17.104 --> 00:19.715
we set out on an
uncertain journey.

00:19.758 --> 00:22.370
A mission of exploration.

00:22.413 --> 00:26.374
We traveled 30 million
miles further than
anyone had gone before.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.941
And we successfully
landed on Mars.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.552
We're looking at a red planet.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.075
[applause]

00:32.119 --> 00:35.078
But it was far from welcoming.

00:35.122 --> 00:40.605
In the time we've been here,
the planet's tested us in ways
we couldn't have imagined.

00:40.649 --> 00:43.739
It's pushed us to
our physical limits.

00:43.782 --> 00:46.394
It's made us closer.

00:46.437 --> 00:51.921
It's made us question our
sanity, and it's taken lives.

00:53.575 --> 00:58.536
But it's also given us
hope that we can make this
another home for humankind,

00:58.580 --> 01:01.931
without repeating the
mistakes we've made on Earth.

01:01.974 --> 01:04.673
JOON: There is life on Mars.

01:16.293 --> 01:19.296
HANA: To make it more
habitable, we've begun 3-D
Printing solar mirrors

01:19.340 --> 01:22.038
and launching them
from the surface.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.650
Eventually, they will form a
reflective screen over the ice
caps to warming the planet and

01:25.694 --> 01:28.131
changing its atmosphere.

01:28.175 --> 01:34.181
With a space station now
in orbit, the Chinese government
is a partner in this experiment.

01:34.224 --> 01:40.230
Science has been the
sole purpose for human
presence here, until now.

01:41.275 --> 01:43.146
Go ahead and run checks
on mass flow rates.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.453
MIKE: Engine test should have
been completed yesterday.

01:45.496 --> 01:47.585
Launch is in a month.

01:47.629 --> 01:50.632
HANA: We can only make
propellant as fast
as we can make it.

01:50.675 --> 01:52.155
It's going to be fine, Mike.

01:52.199 --> 01:55.767
If there's one thing Mars
teaches you, it's patience.

02:00.032 --> 02:01.164
Looks like they're here.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.731
MIKE: They shouldn't be.

02:02.774 --> 02:05.081
HANA: It's not like anyone
could stop them from coming.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.996
I just wish they weren't
going to be so close to us.

02:07.039 --> 02:09.129
MAN [over radio]: Commander,
incoming debris.

02:20.357 --> 02:23.926
Commander, come in.

02:23.969 --> 02:27.886
Are you okay? Commander.

02:31.542 --> 02:36.068

02:36.112 --> 02:40.682

03:01.746 --> 03:04.271
MIKE: Jettisoned
their heat shield.

03:04.314 --> 03:06.751
HANA: Obviously designed
to break up on entry.

03:06.795 --> 03:09.232
MIKE: With all the money this
company has, you'd think they
could come up with one that

03:09.276 --> 03:10.538
didn't litter.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.366
HANA: Or almost kill us.

03:12.409 --> 03:14.237
Look at this mess.

03:29.992 --> 03:32.560
SHEP: Wow.

03:32.603 --> 03:34.823
JEN: I can't believe
we're on Mars.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.955
KURT: Yeah, it's not
to admire the scenery.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.788
We have big plans
for this planet.

03:51.448 --> 03:55.191
BARACK: Last month, we launched
a new spacecraft as part of a
reenergized space program

03:55.235 --> 03:58.586
that will send American
astronauts to Mars.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.283
[applause]

04:00.327 --> 04:03.417
Pushing out into
the solar system.

04:03.460 --> 04:06.594
Not just to visit, but to stay.

04:06.637 --> 04:12.164
ADAM: Mars is really the
beginning of, of our becoming
truly a uh, space-faring race.

04:12.208 --> 04:17.257
ANNOUNCER: 3, 2,
1, and lift-off.

04:18.345 --> 04:21.304
ADAM: The future of humanity is
very much in the solar system.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.306
ANNOUNCER: All systems are go.

04:23.350 --> 04:26.266
ADAM: And so, the question,
as we start to travel
to these other worlds,

04:26.309 --> 04:29.007
what kinds of civilizations
are we going to build?

04:29.051 --> 04:31.140
WOMAN: We need to
protect our planet.

04:31.183 --> 04:33.142
MAN: We're going to need
more oil for the future.

04:33.185 --> 04:37.625
MAN: We can't afford to
make the same mistakes
we made in the past.

04:39.496 --> 04:44.240
MAN: Mars often functions as a
great mirror for concerns that
we have on Earth now that are

04:44.284 --> 04:47.504
ecological and political.

04:47.896 --> 04:49.985
MAN: The front
lines of climate change.

04:50.028 --> 04:53.162
WOMAN: Melting ice
sheets that will raise sea
levels and swamp coast lines.

04:53.205 --> 04:57.340
MAN: The fire-fight
is now a year-round event.

04:57.384 --> 05:02.867
KIM: How do we keep the whole
show going over the long-term
and make it sustainable?

05:02.911 --> 05:05.827
How do we get along together?

05:05.870 --> 05:07.568
[protestors chanting]

05:07.611 --> 05:09.265
NEIL: Does it become
Lord of the Flies?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.484
Who's in charge?

05:10.527 --> 05:12.486
Should anyone be in charge?

05:12.529 --> 05:16.054
We have plenty of evidence
of things going wrong in
the history of actual

05:16.098 --> 05:18.318
human conduct on Earth.

05:18.361 --> 05:21.538
ANNOUNCER: Protestors want the
Dakota oil pipeline route moved
away from the Standing Rock

05:21.582 --> 05:23.671
Reservation.

05:23.714 --> 05:29.590
LUCIANNE: We as a human species
have the ability to affect
and transform our planet.

05:29.633 --> 05:35.335
Some of us might think that
we have to be stewards of
the worlds that we live on.

05:35.378 --> 05:41.341
But at the same time, others
might see planets as something
that are ours to use.

05:41.384 --> 05:47.085
MAN: We can create millions of
new American jobs if we simply
develop energy resources on

05:47.129 --> 05:49.305
federal lands, off-shore.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.395
-The White House's
argument is that the Paris
Agreement is a job-killer.

05:52.439 --> 05:55.790
-The president
announcing the US is quitting
the Paris Climate Agreement.

05:55.833 --> 05:59.228
JARED: Are we explorers
on a path of discovery or
on a path of exploitation?

05:59.271 --> 06:00.795
Of course, we're
both of those things.

06:00.838 --> 06:04.668
We have a right and a left
hand, we explore, we exploit.

06:08.455 --> 06:09.891
ADAM: We're human beings.

06:09.934 --> 06:13.808
We carry the entire evolution
of our species with us.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.592
There will never be a
clean slate on Mars.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.551
[Speaking Mandarin]

06:26.908 --> 06:28.562
CHEN: Solar mirrors
successfully attached.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.868
HANA: And we are
at 6% completion.

06:30.912 --> 06:34.568
At this rate, we'll have warmth,
water, and breathable air by
the time your grandson retires.

06:34.611 --> 06:38.572
The next solar mirror
launch will be delayed a
few weeks, unfortunately.

06:38.615 --> 06:39.790
CHEN: That's fine.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.575
We have plenty to
keep us busy up here.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.577
HANA: Keep busy, or look busy?

06:43.620 --> 06:45.317
I don't know how you
guys can stand it.

06:45.361 --> 06:47.450
Cameras broadcasting 24/7.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.191
CHEN: Hey, it helps
pay for the mission.

06:49.234 --> 06:52.194
And it's made this one
here a superstar back home.

06:58.505 --> 07:01.116
CHEN: So, no comment
on the new neighbors?

07:01.159 --> 07:03.466
HANA: Let's just say they
made quite an entrance.

07:03.510 --> 07:06.121
ROBERT: It's not like they
planned to do what they did,
or that you can control where

07:06.164 --> 07:07.775
jettisoned objects land.

07:07.818 --> 07:09.472
HANA: You're way
too understanding.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.387
It's not just about
how they arrived.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.824
It's the fact that
there's been virtually no
communication with them.

07:13.868 --> 07:16.479
Not before launch, and
not even after landing.

07:16.523 --> 07:19.787
They never even shared their
mission information, other
than projected arrival date

07:19.830 --> 07:20.962
and location.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.616
ROBERT: Lukrum's a
private corporation.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.269
They didn't really have to.

07:24.313 --> 07:28.796
Especially since they came here
independent of any space agency.

07:28.839 --> 07:31.233
VOICE [over computer]:
Elevator ascending.

07:39.371 --> 07:42.331
HANA: It's not like the planet's
ready for mass colonization.

07:42.374 --> 07:43.637
ROBERT: I don't know.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.813
I think it's smart.

07:45.856 --> 07:48.990
Get in on the ground floor,
so they can build everything
that needs to get built.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.035
Gives them time to
find what they need.

07:51.079 --> 07:53.342
HANA: If they even take time.

07:53.385 --> 07:56.563
Seems like they're in a pretty
big hurry to dig into a planet
they know less about than we do.

07:56.606 --> 08:00.175
ROBERT: You just don't
like it, because they
won't be reporting to you.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.353
HANA: No Amelie?

08:04.396 --> 08:07.530
JAVIER: She wouldn't miss work,
not even to meet the new people.

08:07.574 --> 08:10.664
MARTA: She doesn't
need to meet them to know
that she won't like them.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.970
They're not scientists,
for God's sake.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.537
They're miners.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.408
And they already
dumped toxic waste.

08:16.452 --> 08:18.541
MIKE: Literally on top of us.

08:18.585 --> 08:21.370
ROBERT: Look, whatever you think
of Lukrum, they're here for the
same reasons we are:

08:21.413 --> 08:23.198
to pave way for migration.

08:23.241 --> 08:26.070
MARTA: They're here to
steal natural resources
and to make a profit,

08:26.114 --> 08:27.724
just like they do
all over Earth.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.596
There's a difference.

08:29.639 --> 08:34.122
HANA: Well, they're here
either way, so let's try
and make the best of it.

08:41.259 --> 08:44.088
AMELIE: Seasonal
affective disorder.

08:44.132 --> 08:45.699
Depression.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.222
Anxiety.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.572
All of it can cause insomnia.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.357
It's pretty common when
you've been here a long time.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.055
CAMERON: Not sure why it's
happening to me now, then.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.144
I've only been here
a couple of years.

08:56.187 --> 08:59.451
AMELIE: Well, living
in confined spaces affects
different people differently.

08:59.495 --> 09:04.413
But since it's only been a
problem for you recently, I'd
like you to try some herbal

09:04.456 --> 09:08.069
supplements before I
prescribe any medication.

09:08.112 --> 09:10.462
That, and exercise.

09:10.506 --> 09:12.421
Okay, Cameron?

09:12.464 --> 09:14.292
CAMERON: Is that what you do?

09:14.336 --> 09:16.033
AMELIE: Sorry?

09:16.077 --> 09:17.252
CAMERON: To cope?

09:17.295 --> 09:18.906
AMELIE: Me?

09:18.949 --> 09:22.605
I just try and
focus on the future.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.607
CAMERON: Easier to do
when you know what it is.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.957
Who knows how long
we'll be here.

09:27.001 --> 09:30.918
You know, I hear the Lukrum
people are term workers.

09:30.961 --> 09:34.095
Apparently, they cycle
out every four years.

09:34.138 --> 09:36.619
They're not in it
for the long haul.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.621
They're not like us.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.405
Thanks.

09:54.202 --> 09:58.249
ANDY: Mars wouldn't just be
full of scientists and dreamers.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.774
People would be there
to turn a profit.

10:00.817 --> 10:04.647
If there's money to be made
on Mars, then people would
go there to make the money.

10:04.691 --> 10:07.519
ANNOUNCER: Space is turning
private, with plans for profits.

10:07.563 --> 10:11.306
Billionaires are funding
ventures to get past
the Moon, onto Mars.

10:11.349 --> 10:13.525
DYLAN: Imagine a gold
rush to outer space.

10:13.569 --> 10:17.834
ANNOUNCER: It will be very
risky, extremely, expensive, but
none of that is stopping them.

10:17.878 --> 10:21.490
STEPHEN: Mars is going
to be full of private
companies eventually.

10:21.533 --> 10:25.146
It's not just going to be one
company, there are going to be
hundreds of companies on Mars.

10:25.189 --> 10:28.540
It's going to work very much
the way it works on Earth.

10:29.019 --> 10:31.326
ELON: I think a Mars
civilization ultimately looks

10:31.369 --> 10:34.155
like an advanced
version of Earth.

10:34.198 --> 10:39.682
Mars is for anyone who
wants to be an entrepreneur and
going to the brave new world

10:39.726 --> 10:44.252
and to try their fortune, so
Mars is going to be the
planet of opportunity.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.820
MAN: In this land, there is
wealth beyond all dreams.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.996
JOEL: This is very
old human nature.

10:49.039 --> 10:52.913
Humanity has been exploring
foreign land for profit ever
since we've been able to build a

10:52.956 --> 10:54.871
ship and go there.

10:54.915 --> 11:00.660
You see something that
has unimaginable wealth,
and you want to go get it.

11:57.629 --> 12:00.241
ANNOUNCER: The oil and
gas reserves in the
Arctic are massive,

12:00.284 --> 12:03.461
experts say worth possibly
tens of trillions of dollars.

12:03.505 --> 12:07.422
ANNOUNCER: Russia, the US,
Canada, Denmark, and Norway
have all been trying to assert

12:07.465 --> 12:10.425
jurisdiction over
parts of the Arctic.

12:10.468 --> 12:14.603
JOEL: In the Arctic, there
is this mentality that,
let's go get it boys.

12:14.646 --> 12:16.605
You know, it's there.

12:16.648 --> 12:19.086
It's there, ripe for the taking.

12:19.129 --> 12:22.785
There are parallels between
what's going on in space,
and the Arctic cold rush.

12:22.829 --> 12:25.266
It's a new frontier,
it's unexploited.

12:25.309 --> 12:28.791
Space is just, it's
another oil field.

12:28.835 --> 12:31.359
If humans think they can profit,
they're going to go there.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.498
ADAM: People have to have some
way to make a living,

13:23.541 --> 13:26.718
so it can't just be
scientists going out to Mars.

13:26.762 --> 13:32.463
There also has to be a way in
which people can bring their
entrepreneurial spirits and be

13:32.507 --> 13:36.250
able to create thriving
human communities.

13:43.692 --> 13:47.087
ROBERT: Look, there it is.

14:05.105 --> 14:09.065
Wow, great design, self-docking
pods, vehicle lift.

14:09.109 --> 14:11.415
I like it.

14:11.459 --> 14:16.768
JAVIER: We'd have nice
things too, if all our money
wasn't going to your lab.

14:16.812 --> 14:19.728
MIKE: All that for
DNA-based microbes.

14:19.771 --> 14:23.775
MARTA: They may not be new
biochemical life forms, but they
still need to be studied and

14:23.819 --> 14:26.561
protected, especially from them.

14:26.604 --> 14:31.392
HANA: Okay, everybody ready
to meet the neighbors?

MARTA: Oh my God.

14:52.804 --> 14:55.024
Oh, look at you.

14:55.068 --> 14:57.331
Oh, I miss dogs.

14:57.374 --> 15:00.638
[intercom chatter]

15:02.945 --> 15:04.947
KURT: I see
you guys met Marvin.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.818
He's the one who keeps
us all from going crazy.

15:06.862 --> 15:08.690
Commander Hurrelle, but
you can call me Kurt.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.257
MIKE: Lieutenant Mike Glenn.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.606
KURT: Nice to meet
you, Mike Glenn.

15:11.649 --> 15:12.955
HANA: Commander Hana Seung.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.130
KURT: Of course.

15:14.174 --> 15:15.479
You're the one I
want to talk to.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.003
HANA: Likewise.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.440
Because your heat shield sprayed
our launchpad with debris.

15:19.483 --> 15:20.832
KURT: Oh.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.791
I'm sorry, I had no idea.

15:22.834 --> 15:26.708
I tell you what, though,
we, we'll get out
there and clean up ASAP.

15:26.751 --> 15:29.102
Alright, what are you,
about 200 people now?

15:29.145 --> 15:31.104
Must be a pretty
well-oiled machine.

15:31.147 --> 15:33.106
HANA: Yeah, it is.

15:33.149 --> 15:34.846
KURT: That's good, cause
we need to hook up to
your water and your power.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.544
HANA: Sorry?

15:36.587 --> 15:38.807
KURT: Well, it's my
understanding that,
as astronauts, uh,

15:38.850 --> 15:42.854
if we require your help, you're
supposed to give it to us.

15:42.898 --> 15:47.294
Part of the outer space
treaty that each one of
your member nations signed.

15:47.337 --> 15:49.687
HANA: Are you saying
you're in distress?

15:49.731 --> 15:51.951
KURT: No, I'm saying that ten
tons of equipment and 30 crew,
we weren't able to bring that

15:51.994 --> 15:55.650
much water along, beyond what we
have in our radiation shielding.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.304
HANA: You can't be serious.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.393
This should have been
pre-negotiated, pre-planned.

15:59.436 --> 16:02.048
I'm going to have to talk
to IMSF leadership before
I can authorize it.

16:02.091 --> 16:03.484
KURT: You know
what, you do that.

16:03.527 --> 16:04.485
You run it up the chain.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.400
I'm going to start laying pipe.

16:14.060 --> 16:18.325
SUSAN: If Mars is going to
have a thriving human society,
then industry is going to be

16:18.368 --> 16:21.719
absolutely vital to that effort.

16:21.763 --> 16:26.594
But all colonies
throughout human history
have faced a tension,

16:26.637 --> 16:30.859
between the development of the
new society, and preservation.

16:30.902 --> 16:36.865
The more you preserve an area
untouched, the less genuine
society develops there.

16:36.908 --> 16:41.261
The example I always think of
is, there's a straight line from
the Industrial Revolution

16:41.304 --> 16:43.176
to the Modern Age.

16:43.219 --> 16:48.442
Without exploiting fossil
fuels, we would not
have a global society.

16:48.485 --> 16:54.187
When you develop a real vibrant
society, you have the potential
for great growth of knowledge,

16:54.230 --> 16:59.975
but you also are destroying some
natural resources as you do so.

17:00.932 --> 17:05.067
LUCIANNE: Certainly, in
a scenario where you had a Mars
settlement that wanted to grow,

17:05.111 --> 17:08.723
you would be faced
with tough choices.

17:08.766 --> 17:14.076
Even here on Earth, we often
have disputes over how industry
should be allowed to carry out

17:14.120 --> 17:15.599
their business.

17:15.643 --> 17:20.778
On Mars, those tensions are
absolutely exponentially bigger.

17:20.822 --> 17:25.740
And so, it's going to
be really, really hard
to say, yeah, of course,

17:25.783 --> 17:29.222
build some sort of
industrial site here.

17:33.487 --> 17:36.664
JOON: They've had their sights
set on Mars for a long time.

17:36.707 --> 17:39.406
Getting regulatory approvals
wasn't a problem for them.

17:39.449 --> 17:41.103
They have international clout.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.236
But more than that,
they have money.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.542
Lots of it.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.762
And it allowed them to put
together an impressive team of
engineers to plan a mission of

17:47.805 --> 17:48.937
their own.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.460
HANA: That's my point.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.332
The lack of planning.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.203
Water is everything here.

17:54.247 --> 17:56.336
We need it to live,
we need it for fuel.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.033
How could they come
here without enough?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.340
JOON: Because they
knew we couldn't say no
in helping provide it.

18:00.383 --> 18:04.822
What Lukrum Industries really
wants is to back-door IMSF
into some sort of partnership.

18:04.866 --> 18:06.737
HANA: Why?

18:06.781 --> 18:08.435
JOON: To gain credibility
for this so-called
infrastructure mission.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.785
HANA: Even though there's no
one here to provide it for?

18:10.828 --> 18:13.614
JOON: This is just their
way of monetizing Mars.

18:13.657 --> 18:17.096
HANA: This is one of those
times I wish you were
still secretary general.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.538
LESLIE: Has legal
counsel arrived yet?

18:24.581 --> 18:27.149
What Lukrum's trying
to pull off needs to be
dealt with immediately.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.151
MAN: No, but their CEO's here.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.979
ROLAND: Mind if I come in?

18:31.022 --> 18:34.374
Thank you.

18:34.417 --> 18:37.986
I apologize for not having
arranged to meet sooner.

18:38.029 --> 18:41.990
I think it's a holdover from
my never feeling quite welcome
here at IMSF when Joon Seung was

18:42.033 --> 18:44.210
secretary general.

18:44.253 --> 18:48.039
I'm already more
at ease with you.

18:48.083 --> 18:52.174
LESLIE: What your company's
trying to do by demanding water
for humanitarian reasons is a

18:52.218 --> 18:54.829
gross manipulation of
the outer space treaty.

18:54.872 --> 18:57.179
ROLAND: That should have
been my first apology.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.920
The wrong impression was given.

18:58.963 --> 19:01.183
Our mining crews are a little
rough around the edges.

19:01.227 --> 19:05.492
They're not exactly the science
types those in Olympus Town
are used to dealing with, so.

19:05.535 --> 19:11.019
And now, I owe you
a third apology.

19:11.062 --> 19:16.677
Oh, yeah, for a moment,
I'd forgotten you have
that background as well.

19:18.374 --> 19:23.727
It's an interesting
choice, shifting from
scientist to bureaucrat.

19:23.771 --> 19:28.819
LESLIE: My core values are
still the same, advancing
the mission of IMSF.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.344
ROLAND: That's why the
need for infrastructure
can't be overlooked.

19:31.387 --> 19:34.912
LESLIE: Well, it seems Lukrum
did just that, by sending
employees up there without

19:34.956 --> 19:36.871
enough water.

19:36.914 --> 19:39.003
ROLAND: Look, I'm not
going to deny knowing that
we could count on you.

19:39.047 --> 19:41.615
But that was never anything
less than a quid pro quo,
as far as I'm concerned.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.791
I do know that since
the loss of MMC support.

19:43.834 --> 19:47.229
LESLIE: We're not interested
in bringing Lukrum Industries
into the IMSF circle.

19:47.273 --> 19:51.059
ROLAND: You know, I understand
that's been the mentality here.

19:51.102 --> 19:54.715
But you've taken on the
mantle of secretary general
at a difficult time.

19:54.758 --> 20:01.069
Terraforming, particularly at
this pace, won't show progress
for quite some time, if at all.

20:01.112 --> 20:05.639
And even your award-winning
scientist has yet to find
anything new, for years now.

20:05.682 --> 20:07.728
LESLIE: What are you
suggesting, exactly?

20:07.771 --> 20:12.080
ROLAND: That IMSF is
dangerously close to becoming
irrelevant, on your watch.

20:12.123 --> 20:17.128
And you should ask yourself
if you want a second failure
as part of your legacy.

20:18.304 --> 20:19.740
MIKE: So, what happens next?

20:19.783 --> 20:21.872
ROBERT: Building the
link isn't an issue.

20:21.916 --> 20:24.788
We can do that, and I'd
like to, but a lot's needed
to make it happen quickly,

20:24.832 --> 20:26.268
at least on my end.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.965
HANA: Hopefully we won't
need to do anything at all.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.620
This is game-playing,
and IMSF knows it.

20:30.664 --> 20:33.841
Just waiting on an official
note from the secretary general.

20:33.884 --> 20:36.670
MIKE: I'd be happy to
deliver that message for you.

20:36.713 --> 20:39.803
I don't trust that company
or those people one bit.

20:39.847 --> 20:43.938
HANA: We don't need to make
enemies, but we don't need to
be handcuffed to anyone either.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.947
AMELIE: Mm.

20:52.990 --> 20:55.471
I love you.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.125
You know that, right?

20:57.168 --> 20:58.866
JAVIER: I know.

20:58.909 --> 21:02.739
AMELIE: I could
have never lasted here
this long without you.

21:02.783 --> 21:06.526
JAVIER: Too many
years now, right?

21:13.141 --> 21:15.926
Maybe we should do
something about that.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.021
Maybe we should.

21:24.065 --> 21:26.981
AMELIE: I'm going home.

21:34.815 --> 21:37.339
JAVIER: What?

21:37.383 --> 21:42.344
AMELIE: I'm leaving on the next
[inaudible] flight to Earth.

21:42.388 --> 21:45.086
I'm sorry.

21:45.129 --> 21:48.307
I'm so sorry.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.560
LESLIE: Comms.

22:24.604 --> 22:28.390
I need to conference
all member-nation
representatives right away.

22:28.434 --> 22:32.307
VOICE [over computer]:
Conference call request sent.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.788
HANA: Alright, let's
hear what she has to say.

22:34.831 --> 22:36.833
Mae, play message.

22:36.877 --> 22:41.882
LESLIE: After much
discussion, IMSF has struck a
deal with Lukrum Industries.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.405
FEMALE: What?

22:43.449 --> 22:45.146
ROBERT: You're kidding.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.061
LESLIE: They've
agreed to increase our
terraforming efforts,

22:47.104 --> 22:50.412
and will begin manufacturing
solar mirrors on
Mars, which we will launch,

22:50.456 --> 22:53.459
and the Chinese space
station team will attach.

22:53.502 --> 22:58.725
So, for the time being, give
the miners what they want.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.555
VOICE [over computer]:
Transmission ended.

23:08.517 --> 23:12.565
TOM: Any resource
extraction is high-stakes,
even here on the Earth.

23:12.608 --> 23:17.918
It costs millions, tens of
millions, hundreds of millions
to prove up a resource.

23:17.961 --> 23:20.747
If you're going to extract
resources on Mars,

23:20.790 --> 23:23.053
you're going to work with the
best drillers on Earth.

23:34.108 --> 23:38.504
ANTONIA: Drilling in the Arctic
is an incredibly risky endeavor.

23:38.547 --> 23:44.597
There are threats from
extreme frozen waters,
extreme harsh weather.

23:44.640 --> 23:48.601
A lot of the operations have
proven to be empty wells.

23:48.644 --> 23:52.692
And the consequences just for
the companies are enormous.

23:52.735 --> 23:56.347
LESTER: After pouring
$7 billion into its search
for oil in the Arctic,

23:56.391 --> 23:59.525
Royal Dutch Shell announced
today it was calling it quits.

23:59.568 --> 24:03.877
MAN: After more than ten years,
the oil giant announced it
was abandoning the search.

24:03.920 --> 24:07.402
-This is a very, very hostile,
very remote environment.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.492
It's really like trying
to drill on Mars.

24:10.536 --> 24:14.235
JOEL: The Arctic is by far
the hardest place to drill
off-shore in the world.

24:14.278 --> 24:17.499
And it's a very expensive
place for companies to operate.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.936
You know, you're laying a
lot of it out on the line.

24:46.223 --> 24:49.226
TOM: On Mars, the stakes
are going to be even higher.

24:49.270 --> 24:52.012
There's going to be high drama
and high stakes all the time,

24:52.055 --> 24:54.623
around this kind of development.

24:56.538 --> 25:00.063
[radio chatter]

25:01.412 --> 25:05.504
MAN [over radio]: Hold it,
hold it, hold it...
alright drop it off.

25:09.116 --> 25:11.379
MIKE: Well,
that's five kilometers down.

25:11.422 --> 25:13.555
20 to go.

25:13.599 --> 25:18.517
Alright, let's get this
pipeline done, we need that
water, let's move, let's go.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.694
SHEP: It was getting over
the first rise, cost more
time than we thought.

25:21.737 --> 25:23.696
JEN: We can make up for
it here, in the flats.

25:23.739 --> 25:26.350
KURT: This is
taking way too long.

25:26.394 --> 25:29.919
JEN: Okay, well maybe we can see
if our friends at Olympus Town
will lend us some of their crew.

25:29.963 --> 25:31.704
KURT: Yeah, I doubt
they'd be much help.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.575
SHEP: Also, it's not like the
manpower that's slowing us down.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.229
It's how hard this ground is.

25:35.272 --> 25:37.405
KURT: What's slowing us down is
not being smart about the route.

25:37.448 --> 25:41.757
If we cut through this
area here, we save three
days and tons of material.

25:41.801 --> 25:43.846
JEN: Yes, but I
thought that we had to.

25:43.890 --> 25:46.588
KURT: Jen, we just need
to connect to Olympus Town
and get on with it, okay.

25:46.632 --> 25:50.592
Look, every day we're not
drilling keeps us further
from hitting pay dirt.

25:50.636 --> 25:53.900
We're here for a reason,
unlike our friends
over at science camp,

25:53.943 --> 25:57.207
it's not to watch
the ice caps melt.

25:58.469 --> 26:02.343
HANA: Lukrum's going to have
the pipeline here early, is
that going to work for us?

26:02.386 --> 26:04.519
JAVIER: We're halfway
through load testing now.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.260
So far, so good.

26:06.303 --> 26:07.914
HANA: So, you don't
anticipate any problems?

26:07.957 --> 26:09.089
JAVIER: No.

26:09.132 --> 26:10.133
Okay, shut it down.

26:10.177 --> 26:12.396
Let's try reactor two.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.964
HANA: Because even if Lukrum's
ready sooner, we should only
share resources if it's safe to

26:15.008 --> 26:16.749
do so.

26:16.792 --> 26:19.273
I don't want you working any
faster than you need to, Javier.

26:19.316 --> 26:20.274
JAVIER: It's fine.

26:20.317 --> 26:21.841
Doesn't bother me.

26:25.018 --> 26:28.412
HANA: Okay. So, what
is it, then?

26:28.456 --> 26:31.502
You seem bothered
about something.

26:31.546 --> 26:33.461
JAVIER: You knew.

26:33.504 --> 26:35.158
You had to have known.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.465
Have to approve it, make
plans for it, arrange
for another doctor

26:37.508 --> 26:39.815
to take her place.

26:39.859 --> 26:41.600
HANA: I did.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.950
And I'm sorry.

26:43.993 --> 26:48.128
But you have to understand,
that information was
not mine to share with you.

26:48.171 --> 26:51.305
Look, I know how it must feel.

26:51.348 --> 26:53.960
JAVIER: No, don't.

26:54.003 --> 26:57.790
Amelie is leaving, and it's
not like I can chase after her.

26:57.833 --> 27:00.662
My body's not prepared
to make the trip now.

27:00.706 --> 27:04.927
And it's three years before
another trip is even possible,
and seven months of travel time

27:04.971 --> 27:07.451
on top of that.

27:07.495 --> 27:11.325
It's too long, for anyone.

27:11.368 --> 27:14.371
The water system is good to go.

27:28.734 --> 27:31.432
JOON: Leslie.

27:31.475 --> 27:34.217
LESLIE: Hello.

27:34.261 --> 27:37.133
I was here early.

27:37.177 --> 27:41.660
JOON: He was an amazing
scientist, and a good man.

27:41.703 --> 27:44.358
LESLIE: They're all good.

27:44.401 --> 27:48.362
JOON: I know you feel
that somehow what happened
is a reflection on you.

27:48.405 --> 27:50.277
LESLIE: It was.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.192
It is.

27:52.235 --> 27:55.325
JOON: Paul wouldn't have
wanted you to just walk away.

27:55.369 --> 27:58.546
He wouldn't have wanted
you to just stop.

27:58.589 --> 28:01.549
LESLIE: Joon, I can't go back.

28:01.592 --> 28:04.117
JOON: I'm not asking you to.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.772
LESLIE: Then why am I here?

28:06.815 --> 28:09.035
JOON: I pulled some strings.

28:09.078 --> 28:11.037
I moved myself up in the queue.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.865
I intend to travel
on the next ship out.

28:12.908 --> 28:14.040
LESLIE: To Mars?

28:14.083 --> 28:16.564
JOON: I know it seems impulsive.

28:16.607 --> 28:21.612
But, if I don't go now,
I probably never will.

28:23.484 --> 28:26.879
LESLIE: And you can't leave
until you've found a suitable
replacement for your position as

28:26.922 --> 28:29.751
secretary general.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.492
Why me?

28:31.535 --> 28:33.581
JOON: Because you
get it, Leslie.

28:33.624 --> 28:35.888
The politics and the science.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.759
LESLIE: And you think I
have something to prove?

28:37.803 --> 28:39.587
JOON: Don't you?

28:39.630 --> 28:41.763
MAN: Secretary general.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.765
LESLIE: Yes?

28:43.809 --> 28:45.898
MAN: Are you ready?

28:45.941 --> 28:48.422
LESLIE: I'll be right there.

28:56.517 --> 29:01.435
MARTA: Let's see
how these cultures tolerate
dehydration in this sector.

29:01.478 --> 29:03.437
CAMERON: 114.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.265
MARTA: Excuse me?

29:05.308 --> 29:06.919
CAMERON: That's how many
times we field-tested
variations of this same

29:06.962 --> 29:09.617
microbial form since
I've been here.

29:09.660 --> 29:12.794
MARTA: If you think that's a
lot, you should hear my number.

29:12.838 --> 29:14.622
CAMERON: Probably right.

29:14.665 --> 29:17.320
Makes me wonder how you've kept
from going nuts in this place.

29:17.364 --> 29:21.455
MARTA: This place, as you call
it, may have answers to the
questions we've been asking for

29:21.498 --> 29:24.110
centuries.

29:26.329 --> 29:31.813
Where you see a red,
dusty planet, I see
beauty and possibility.

29:31.857 --> 29:38.167
I see a world that's
new and pure, and alive.

29:38.211 --> 29:41.083
There isn't just
one life form here.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.998
There can't be.

29:45.044 --> 29:47.263
We have to keep looking.

29:47.307 --> 29:48.961
CAMERON: Yeah.

29:49.004 --> 29:52.312
I hope we find something
before funding runs out.

30:02.191 --> 30:05.238
MARTA: What's this?

30:17.250 --> 30:19.208
CAMERON: Is that
one of Lukrum's?

30:19.252 --> 30:21.515
MARTA: This area is
off-limits to them.

30:21.558 --> 30:23.865
They can't do this.

30:23.909 --> 30:27.086
CAMERON: Well, it
looks like they are.

30:38.271 --> 30:41.013
ZUBRIN: People will go to Mars
to try to make their fortune.

30:41.056 --> 30:44.581
Yes, they're doing a job for
the corporation back home.

30:44.625 --> 30:48.585
But they also are creating
lives for themselves.

30:50.283 --> 30:54.200
SUSAN: You go to the frontier
because you have a vision
for you and your family.

30:54.243 --> 30:56.550
That is not a greedy thing.

30:56.593 --> 31:01.337
That is a human impulse to want
to do better for your family.

31:02.991 --> 31:07.213
JOEL: It takes that sort
of frontier mentality to
do this work in the Arctic.

31:07.256 --> 31:11.217
People have to leave
their families for
often months at a time,

31:11.260 --> 31:14.742
and go work in these very
isolated environments.

32:25.769 --> 32:27.293
GIRL: Hi, Daddy.

32:27.336 --> 32:31.210
A few days ago, I went
to the store with Mom.

32:31.253 --> 32:32.472
Boring.

32:32.515 --> 32:34.648
But it was actually pretty fun.

32:34.691 --> 32:36.824
I got a crystal kit.

32:36.867 --> 32:39.522
You would probably think I
bought this, but I grew it.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.481
Isn't it pretty?

32:41.524 --> 32:44.701
I'm going to call
it the Kurt crystal.

32:44.745 --> 32:47.139
If you were here, I
would give it to you.

32:47.182 --> 32:49.010
But you're not.

32:49.054 --> 32:52.144
I want you to come home.

32:52.187 --> 32:54.146
I miss you, Daddy.

32:54.189 --> 32:56.670
A whole lot.

32:58.411 --> 33:02.632
HANA: Everything was running
smoothly, and now it feels like,
like I'm suddenly in over my

33:02.676 --> 33:04.939
head.

33:04.983 --> 33:09.596
Javier's pissed at me, Leslie
barely speaks to me, and this
jerk from Lukrum is treating me

33:09.639 --> 33:11.337
like I'm a little girl.

33:11.380 --> 33:14.862
JOON: Hana, your experience
can't be denied by anyone.

33:14.905 --> 33:17.038
Always remember that.

33:17.082 --> 33:19.519
MARTA: Sorry to interrupt,
but this is important.

33:19.562 --> 33:21.825
HANA: I got to go.

33:21.869 --> 33:25.394
MARTA: Those idiots from Lukrum
are plowing through sector two,
which is an area devoted to

33:25.438 --> 33:27.005
scientific study.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.702
And they're contaminating
the hell out of it.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.356
HANA: What?

33:30.399 --> 33:31.705
MARTA: You need to do something.
HANA: We agreed on the routing.

33:31.748 --> 33:33.924
MARTA: Are you going to
call their commander?

33:33.968 --> 33:36.014
HANA: I'm going to
do more than that.

33:40.279 --> 33:41.410
KURT: How are you doing?

33:41.454 --> 33:42.716
HANA: Good.

33:42.759 --> 33:43.891
I appreciate you coming.

33:43.934 --> 33:45.501
JEN: I'm Jen, Senior
Systems Engineer.

33:45.545 --> 33:47.068
HANA: Pleasure.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.070
Nice to see Lukrum has
some women in their ranks.

33:49.114 --> 33:53.596
JEN: Yeah, there are
six of us, and he cuts
us no slack whatsoever.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.424
KURT: That's a nice elevator.

33:55.468 --> 33:59.385
HANA: Robert, who you
met, he had it built
for us a few years ago.

33:59.428 --> 34:01.996
He also created this park.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.172
-Oh, wow.

34:04.216 --> 34:06.827
-It also helps the crew keep
their circadian rhythms.

34:06.870 --> 34:09.177
KURT: That's pretty great.

34:09.221 --> 34:11.745
HANA: It's a place for people
to get together, relax, and
experience day and night like

34:11.788 --> 34:13.486
they did on Earth.

34:13.529 --> 34:15.792
But that's not what
I wanted you to see.

34:15.836 --> 34:18.578
Right this way.

34:19.448 --> 34:21.146
KURT: Is that why I'm
here, for show and tell?

34:21.189 --> 34:24.410
HANA: Kurt, I understand
your desire to move quickly.

34:24.453 --> 34:27.587
But your crew has cut
into a scientific preserve, and
obviously I cannot allow that to

34:27.630 --> 34:29.415
happen.

34:29.458 --> 34:31.852
This is why.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.602
KURT: Yeah, I get it.

34:42.645 --> 34:44.560
You do important work here.

34:44.604 --> 34:46.954
HANA: We're testing
samples in the area, and
can't risk contamination.

34:46.997 --> 34:49.870
JEN: With all due respect,
commander, the crew is a good
500 meters from where your

34:49.913 --> 34:51.480
scientists work.

34:51.524 --> 34:52.916
KURT: Look, I get the whole,
let's keep it a museum thing.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.614
HANA: Kurt, I'm not talking
about the entire planet.

34:54.657 --> 34:56.529
KURT: That's why we're doing
our part by making the pipeline.

34:56.572 --> 34:58.183
HANA: I'm talking
about one sector.

34:58.226 --> 34:59.575
KURT: Which means we're going to
be using less of the resources.

34:59.619 --> 35:00.924
HANA: And that's great.

35:00.968 --> 35:02.970
But boundaries still
have to be respected.

35:03.013 --> 35:06.060
Marta's research on
microbial life is central to
the work we're doing here.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.627
KURT: That's funny,
cause I thought maybe
changing the atmosphere

35:07.670 --> 35:09.194
was the bigger mission.

35:09.237 --> 35:11.065
HANA: Obviously, terraforming
is vitally important, too.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.632
KURT: Uh, breathable
air versus microbes.

35:12.675 --> 35:14.721
Seems like a no-brainer to me.

35:14.764 --> 35:17.811
HANA: I assure you,
everything we do here takes
brains and proper planning.

35:17.854 --> 35:21.989
We're not the ones in
need of water and power.

35:22.032 --> 35:25.166
KURT: Fine, we'll go back
to the original route.

35:25.210 --> 35:28.300
It's the least we can do for
the people helping us out.

35:32.434 --> 35:35.045
You ready to go?

35:35.089 --> 35:36.873
We'll show ourselves out.

35:36.917 --> 35:38.745
HANA: Mhm.

35:43.532 --> 35:45.317
KURT: Hey.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.536
Nice work on that elevator.

35:47.580 --> 35:49.147
ROBERT: Thanks.

35:51.366 --> 35:52.672
How'd it go?

35:52.715 --> 35:54.500
HANA: I'm not sure.

35:54.543 --> 35:57.807
But I think I'd feel better
having eyes and ears on them.

36:12.082 --> 36:16.043
AMELIE: You moved your
things out of our HAB
without a single word?

36:16.086 --> 36:18.567
JAVIER: Are you really comparing
what I did to what you did?

36:18.611 --> 36:20.439
AMELIE: No.

36:20.482 --> 36:23.485
I should have told you
sooner, but I just, I
just didn't know how.

36:23.529 --> 36:25.879
JAVIER: You lied.

36:25.922 --> 36:28.055
For months.

36:28.098 --> 36:31.928
And waited until it
was too late for me to
go with you to tell me.

36:31.972 --> 36:35.280
AMELIE: I, I just
didn't want to hurt you.

36:35.323 --> 36:38.239
But, in the beginning, I really
thought I could do this.

36:38.283 --> 36:40.894
I thought I could stay,
and I thought I wanted it.

36:40.937 --> 36:44.114
And being with you
helped me so much.

36:44.158 --> 36:46.595
JAVIER: So, we are together
because we've been stuck here.

36:46.639 --> 36:48.902
AMELIE: No, I just,
look at us, Javier.

36:48.945 --> 36:53.254
We've been living under dorms
for nine years, nine years.

36:53.298 --> 36:54.951
I miss Earth.

36:54.995 --> 36:57.258
I miss breathing fresh
air, I miss real grass.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.521
I miss, I miss the
clouds, I miss the rain.

36:59.565 --> 37:00.653
Look around you.

37:00.696 --> 37:02.176
This is all fake.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.569
I miss real life.

37:03.612 --> 37:04.831
JAVIER: This is real life too.

37:04.874 --> 37:06.267
This is real grass too.

37:06.311 --> 37:08.748
AMELIE: I miss my family!

37:08.791 --> 37:13.143
And I've tried to fight it, I've
tried to stop thinking about it,
dreaming about it, but I can't.

37:13.187 --> 37:14.710
I just can't.

37:14.754 --> 37:19.062
And if I stay here any longer,
I'm just going to lose it.

37:23.980 --> 37:26.461
I'm sorry.

37:26.505 --> 37:29.638
I have to go.

37:31.205 --> 37:36.602
JAVIER: As far as I'm
concerned, you're already gone.

37:40.388 --> 37:41.781
KURT: How much longer guys?

37:41.824 --> 37:42.999
WOMAN: Waiting on the crane.

37:43.043 --> 37:44.305
MAN: Checking the hydraulics.

37:44.349 --> 37:45.437
KURT: And?

37:45.480 --> 37:46.481
WOMAN: Seems okay?

37:46.525 --> 37:47.830
Should we do a line inspection?

37:47.874 --> 37:49.179
KURT: After this
one gets placed.

37:49.223 --> 37:50.485
MAN: Copy that.

37:50.529 --> 37:51.965
WOMAN: Could use some
more hands over here.

37:52.008 --> 37:53.140
MAN: Stepping in.

37:53.183 --> 37:54.620
WOMAN: Alright,
let's bring it down.

37:54.663 --> 37:55.838
MAN: Roger that.

37:55.882 --> 37:57.318
KURT: Where are the
rest of the pipes, guys?

37:57.362 --> 37:59.146
WOMAN: Got the next one
already cinched and hooked.

37:59.189 --> 38:00.930
And six more en route.

38:00.974 --> 38:03.019
KURT: Should have been
here ten minutes ago,
we need to keep pushing.

38:03.063 --> 38:05.021
WOMAN: I have three more coming.

38:05.065 --> 38:06.458
MAN: Copy that.

38:06.501 --> 38:08.155
How's the core alignment?

38:08.198 --> 38:09.156
Looking good?

38:09.199 --> 38:10.331
SHEP: Hey, Terry!

38:10.375 --> 38:11.593
Keep that toe line tight.

38:11.637 --> 38:12.812
MAN: Yes, sir.

38:12.855 --> 38:14.030
SHEP: Come on, guys.
I know you're tired.

38:14.074 --> 38:15.597
I am too, but we're
moving way too slow.

38:15.641 --> 38:16.816
Let's get this one placed and
synced as quick as we can.

38:16.859 --> 38:18.861
Let's go guys, we
got a target number to hit.

38:18.905 --> 38:21.255
JEN: Yeah, we're going
as fast as we can, Shep.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.476
SHEP: We need to get hooked up
to that water, people or we're
going to have a real problem.

38:24.519 --> 38:29.481
JEN: Hey help me hold this down.
It's not activating.

38:29.524 --> 38:31.874
Hey, why don't you relieve
Terry while I do this?

38:31.918 --> 38:33.528
He looks exhausted.

38:33.572 --> 38:36.183
MIKE: Who isn't?

38:36.226 --> 38:38.098
SHEP: Jen, what are you doing?

38:38.141 --> 38:40.492
JEN: I just need to
do a quick diagnostic.

38:40.535 --> 38:42.058
SHEP: Well, make it snappy.

38:42.102 --> 38:43.799
We've already lost daylight,
and we're nowhere near done.

38:43.843 --> 38:46.672
Right, while she's
doing that, let's start
prepping the next pipe.

38:46.715 --> 38:48.500
ROBERT: Do you always
move at this fast a clip?

38:48.543 --> 38:49.849
JEN: No, we usually move faster.

38:49.892 --> 38:51.851
Shep's just tired today.

38:51.894 --> 38:53.679
You're the design genius, right?

38:53.722 --> 38:55.681
The one that built the elevator.

38:55.724 --> 38:56.986
ROBERT: Group effort.

38:57.030 --> 38:58.597
But that was a while ago.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.076
Haven't built much since.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.774
SHEP: Jen, what could
possibly be taking this long?

39:01.817 --> 39:02.862
JEN: Nothing.

39:02.905 --> 39:04.298
I'm on it.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.517
Sorry.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.388
SHEP: Okay, let's get
this done already.

39:07.432 --> 39:08.520
What's going on down there?

39:08.563 --> 39:10.217
JEN: Yeah, there's a short.

39:10.260 --> 39:11.523
SHEP: We're going to
switch out the bad one.

39:11.566 --> 39:12.872
JEN: Wait, hang on.

39:12.915 --> 39:14.395
I got to pull the
plug out first.

39:14.439 --> 39:15.440
SHEP: Come on.

39:15.483 --> 39:16.745
JEN: It's stuck.

39:16.789 --> 39:17.877
ROBERT: Let me help you.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.053
WOMAN: [inaudible].
MAN: I'm good.

39:20.096 --> 39:21.402
SHEP: Pull the pipe out.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.407
ROBERT: Hold on.

39:26.451 --> 39:27.930
Hold on, I almost got it.

39:27.974 --> 39:29.802
SHEP: Just leave it, we'll
switch it out for the next pipe.

39:29.845 --> 39:31.064
JEN: No!

39:31.107 --> 39:32.761
[screams]

39:39.464 --> 39:41.640
[screams]

39:47.515 --> 39:49.125
AMELIE: Displaced
fracture with [inaudible].

39:49.169 --> 39:51.867
Robert, we're going to
take care of you, okay?

39:51.911 --> 39:55.436
SHEP: I tried to keep as much
pressure on it as I could, but
he's, he's lost a lot of blood.

39:55.480 --> 39:59.266
AMELIE: Radial pulse
is good, so at least his
arteries weren't severed.

39:59.309 --> 40:00.876
Can you move your
fingers at all?

40:00.920 --> 40:02.095
ROBERT: No, not really.

40:02.138 --> 40:04.010
AMELIE: Okay, okay.

40:04.053 --> 40:05.925
Prep the OR, he's going to
need open reduction
and internal fixation.

40:05.968 --> 40:07.056
WOMAN: What does that mean?

40:07.100 --> 40:09.102
AMELIE: Let's get
him into the bay.

40:09.145 --> 40:11.321
We need to set the bone
surgically using plates
and screws, lots of them,

40:11.365 --> 40:13.019
and hope there's
no nerve damage.

40:13.062 --> 40:14.890
Let's get his a scan
and treat his pain.

40:14.934 --> 40:16.544
HANA: How could they
allow this to happen?

40:16.588 --> 40:18.111
ROBERT: It wasn't
them, it was me.

40:18.154 --> 40:19.460
I wanted to help.

40:19.504 --> 40:20.766
HANA: Why would you do that?

40:20.809 --> 40:23.377
ROBERT: Maybe I wanted
to feel useful, okay?

40:31.646 --> 40:35.302
VOICE [over computer]:
Comminuted fractures of the
radius and ulna as indicated.

40:35.345 --> 40:37.478
Soft tissue damage as indicated

40:37.522 --> 40:38.827
AMELIE: Not a surprise.

40:38.871 --> 40:40.829
Pretty big crush
injury to your forearm.

40:40.873 --> 40:43.310
But, it could have
been a lot worse.

40:43.353 --> 40:45.007
ROBERT: Are you
saying I'm lucky?

40:45.051 --> 40:46.487
AMELIE: That you didn't lose it?

40:46.531 --> 40:47.836
Yes.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.838
But it'll be months
before you fully heal.

40:49.882 --> 40:54.713
And with injuries like
this, it's possible
you may never be 100%.

40:54.756 --> 40:58.804
ROBERT: How can I
be here, and not be able
to do what I need to do?

40:58.847 --> 41:00.980
What I want to do?

41:01.023 --> 41:04.810
AMELIE: Hey, hopefully, that
won't be the case for you, okay?

41:04.853 --> 41:08.857
Come on, let's get you
prepped for surgery.

41:11.556 --> 41:14.210
ROBERT: So, I hear
you're going back.

41:14.254 --> 41:17.518
You know we're all
going to miss you here.

41:17.562 --> 41:19.999
AMELIE: Another doctor is
on his way to take my place.

41:20.042 --> 41:22.218
ROBERT: But you're one of us.

41:22.262 --> 41:24.917
One of the first.

41:24.960 --> 41:29.051
AMELIE: You're being
sentimental, Robert.

41:29.095 --> 41:32.620
Must be the painkillers talking.

41:34.230 --> 41:36.581
Okay, sit here.

41:40.628 --> 41:43.457
ROBERT: I don't know
why you'd want to leave.

41:43.501 --> 41:47.069
Everything here is so easy.

41:55.251 --> 41:58.559
JAVIER: I heard what happened.

41:58.603 --> 42:01.649
HANA: I sent him there.

42:05.610 --> 42:09.222
JAVIER: You
may be in charge, but not
everything is your fault.

42:09.265 --> 42:12.530
People make their own decisions,
and sometimes they get hurt.

42:12.573 --> 42:15.750
HANA: Or hurt others
without intending to.

42:23.628 --> 42:25.238
You're not going in there?

42:25.281 --> 42:27.109
JAVIER: I will, later.

42:27.153 --> 42:29.895
There's a lot of work I still
need to do for the pipeline.

42:29.938 --> 42:34.639
Not like this is
going to stop Lukrum from
getting here on schedule.

42:36.162 --> 42:38.251
HANA: That's for sure.

42:45.475 --> 42:47.913
Alright, let's do this.

42:47.956 --> 42:51.220
MAN: All drives linked
in, operational.

42:53.309 --> 42:55.616
JAVIER: Systems set.

42:56.399 --> 42:58.706
MAN: Lukrum colony on standby.

43:02.405 --> 43:04.451
HANA: Initiate.

43:10.675 --> 43:15.070
MAN: Network engaged,
power uploading.

43:15.984 --> 43:18.726
Outflow in progress.

43:20.989 --> 43:22.295
Connection made.

43:22.338 --> 43:25.211
[applause]

43:26.821 --> 43:29.868
MARTA: I don't
care if they do have a dog.

43:30.520 --> 43:33.306
KURT: Alright, that's it,
we are officially linked!

43:33.349 --> 43:35.787
Good job, everybody.

43:35.830 --> 43:39.486
LESLIE: With Lukrum Industries'
commitment to the additional
production of solar mirrors,

43:39.529 --> 43:42.968
we are effectively doubling
our terraforming efforts.

43:43.011 --> 43:48.800
Ladies and gentlemen, IMSF is
making Mars habitable and soon.

43:48.843 --> 43:51.237
[applause]

44:34.759 --> 44:36.195
KURT: How's Robert?

44:36.238 --> 44:38.371
HANA: Better.

44:38.414 --> 44:41.635
He'll take some time
to recover, but he's lucky he
didn't lose his arm entirely.

44:41.679 --> 44:44.943
KURT: Yeah, again, I'm
real sorry that happened.

44:44.986 --> 44:48.076
Accidents do.

44:48.120 --> 44:52.341
HANA: I know you're starting
to survey, but it's important
I share my experience with you,

44:52.385 --> 44:54.082
commander to commander.

44:54.126 --> 44:55.301
You're new.

44:55.344 --> 44:57.477
I'm not.

44:57.520 --> 45:02.395
And the one thing I've
learned in my time here, is
that you can't force anything.

45:02.438 --> 45:08.053
You have to take it slow,
and on the planet's terms,
or face consequences.

45:08.096 --> 45:11.273
KURT: I appreciate the advice.

45:13.058 --> 45:15.060
Look.

45:15.103 --> 45:18.672
I'm sorry that we did not
start off on the best foot.

45:18.716 --> 45:21.762
HANA: We're glad to
have partners in the
terraforming effort.

45:21.806 --> 45:25.592
I look forward to cooperation
between our colonies, as long
as boundaries are respected.

45:25.635 --> 45:28.421
KURT: We will absolutely
try to do that.

45:28.464 --> 45:32.860
But you have to know, there
are no real boundaries here.

45:32.904 --> 45:34.775
Not for Lukrum, anyway.

45:34.819 --> 45:37.082
We're a company, not a country.

45:37.125 --> 45:41.347
We didn't sign the outer space
treaty, and we aren't even based
in a country that did sign it.

45:41.390 --> 45:46.091
So those laws, they
only apply to you guys.

45:58.016 --> 46:00.235
HANA: We're not alone.

46:00.279 --> 46:03.673
There are other human
beings on Mars now.

46:03.717 --> 46:07.808
And while all of us have the
same basic needs, and the same
long-term goal of making this

46:07.852 --> 46:11.507
planet a home for humankind,

46:11.551 --> 46:14.467
co-existence may prove
just as challenging

46:14.510 --> 46:17.949
as it does on Earth.
