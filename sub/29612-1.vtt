01:25.750 --> 01:27.582
Please, come in.

01:30.666 --> 01:32.665
Can I offer you something to drink?

01:34.166 --> 01:37.374
Which newspaper did you say
you work for?

02:53.208 --> 02:54.999
Excuse me?

02:56.958 --> 02:58.749
ls everything ok?

03:01.041 --> 03:04.499
He's dead.
PresidentiaI suite.

03:20.166 --> 03:24.624
THE COLLlNI CASE

03:56.916 --> 03:58.915
CounseIlor Caspar Leinen, good afternoon.

03:59.666 --> 04:02.582
l'm Judge KoehIer, we spoke on the phone.
This is State Prosecutor Reimers.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.874
State prosecutor...
- Good afternoon.

04:07.666 --> 04:09.665
Leinen, good afternoon.

04:13.708 --> 04:14.415
So...

04:14.625 --> 04:22.124
The defendant is Fabrizio CoIlini, born in 1 934
in Montecatini near Pisa. ItaIian citizen.

04:22.291 --> 04:26.457
He speaks German reasonabIy welI and has
Iived in the Stuttgart area for over 30 years.

04:26.666 --> 04:27.749
Not married.

04:27.916 --> 04:33.457
He stands accused of kiIling Jean-Baptiste
Meyer in the presidentiaI suite...

04:33.666 --> 04:37.415
...of the HoteI CircIe
with three shots to the head.

04:37.625 --> 04:41.749
WouId you Iike to speak with your
cIient before we begin?

04:41.916 --> 04:42.957
Of course.

04:43.583 --> 04:44.999
Alright then...

04:47.083 --> 04:49.249
And you'lI both wait here?

04:49.416 --> 04:50.999
We wiII.

04:52.291 --> 04:53.915
See you in a minute.

05:07.666 --> 05:08.790
Aha...

05:48.708 --> 05:51.040
HelIo, my name's Leinen.
l'm your attorney.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.999
ShouId I inform anyone you're here?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.582
Have you given a statement to the poIice?

06:14.416 --> 06:15.290
Good...

06:15.958 --> 06:19.457
You shouId refrain from making a statement
untiI I see what evidence they have against you.

06:27.750 --> 06:31.040
Alright, then Iet's
get started, ok?

06:35.875 --> 06:38.124
The defendant has not given a statement...

06:38.291 --> 06:42.415
...but the physicaI evidence against him is
compelIing: fingerprints on murder weapon...

06:42.625 --> 06:47.165
...bIood on his cIothing and shoes,
powder burns on his hands...

06:47.333 --> 06:49.290
...as weII as testimony from witnesses.

06:49.458 --> 06:54.124
Mr. CoIIini, do you understand
the charges against you?

06:55.791 --> 06:56.999
Mr. CoIIini?

06:59.208 --> 07:01.915
The defendant does not wish
to speak at this time.

07:02.708 --> 07:05.749
Mr. CoIIini, I'm holding you for triaI.

07:09.458 --> 07:11.624
GentIemen, any more business?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.499
l'd like to fiIe a motion for discovery.
- Noted.

07:14.708 --> 07:18.582
And I fiIe to be assigned to the accused
as his public defender.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.832
Does the State object?

07:24.166 --> 07:28.790
l hereby appoint Caspar Leinen as
pubIic defender to Fabrizio CoIIini.

07:28.958 --> 07:30.249
That's aII.

07:44.291 --> 07:46.290
Alright, then...

07:48.041 --> 07:50.040
Thank you, gentIemen.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.124
Mr. Leinen...

07:57.708 --> 07:59.999
How Iong is it since you passed the bar?

08:01.208 --> 08:02.957
About three months.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.999
Do me a favor and look around the room...

08:07.416 --> 08:09.790
Do you see an audience?

08:14.458 --> 08:15.207
No.

08:15.375 --> 08:18.249
So why are you wearing your robes?

08:31.208 --> 08:33.664
You wore your robes to the arraignment?

08:33.832 --> 08:35.624
Are you Iosing it, or what?

08:37.250 --> 08:39.249
Hey, look.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.124
l thought he quit.

08:43.041 --> 08:46.249
You know he saiIed across the
AtIantic after his wife died?

08:46.416 --> 08:49.874
SingIe-handed.
He's back in the Iand of the Iiving now.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.624
You had Mattinger, right?
- Criminal Iaw.

08:54.041 --> 09:00.290
l watched a trial where he cross-examined
a witness for 57 days. 57 days!

09:00.458 --> 09:03.457
The judge and the prosecutor
were reaIly pissed!

09:03.666 --> 09:05.040
But he didn't beIieve her.

09:05.208 --> 09:08.499
And on day 58 she admitted that
her husband hadn't blackmaiIed her.

09:08.833 --> 09:11.332
She made it up, to get revenge.

09:12.208 --> 09:14.290
Your murder trial sounds pretty hopeIess.

09:14.458 --> 09:16.290
No triaI is hopeIess.

09:16.833 --> 09:18.832
Anyway, you've a big job ahead.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.457
You shouId buy new robes,
so you'lI Iook good in the papers.

09:21.666 --> 09:22.999
Yeah, Iet's not get carried away.

09:23.166 --> 09:25.874
What?
He kilIed Hans Meyer.

09:26.041 --> 09:27.040
What?

09:27.708 --> 09:29.707
lt was on the radio this morning.

09:30.666 --> 09:33.707
The owner of MMF.
Meyer Machine Fabrik?

09:34.375 --> 09:38.040
Member of the Order of Merit of the
FederaI RepubIic of Germany.

09:40.625 --> 09:41.999
Are you okay?

09:46.750 --> 09:48.332
l'II be right back.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.749
Caspar, come on!

10:05.958 --> 10:07.790
lt's me again, Caspar Leinen...

10:07.958 --> 10:09.790
l have a question about
Jean-Baptiste Meyer.

10:10.083 --> 10:12.165
Hey! This is our Iake,
you shitty Turk!

10:12.333 --> 10:13.832
What did you say?

10:14.291 --> 10:19.082
l've no idea where my grandson learned such
a disgusting Iack of hospitaIity, I'm truIy sorry.

10:20.708 --> 10:22.999
The victim in the case...
lt's not the...

10:23.125 --> 10:25.499
Hans Meyer, good afternoon.

10:26.500 --> 10:30.499
l'm sorry, Caspar.
l'm PhiIIip.

10:40.791 --> 10:43.082
Radio FFM Berlin.
And now, the news.

10:44.166 --> 10:50.374
ln the investigation into the murder of MMF CEO
Hans Meyer, the police are still in the dark.

10:50.583 --> 10:54.790
According to a statement, Johanna
Meyer, the granddaughter of the deceased...

10:54.958 --> 10:58.624
...will take over management
of Meyer Machine Fabrik.

10:58.791 --> 11:01.707
ln the Berlin banking scandal
there is still no resolution in sight.

11:01.875 --> 11:05.082
lt's still unclear
whether the state of Berlin...

11:05.250 --> 11:07.790
You're stiIl driving that oId thing.

11:16.208 --> 11:19.124
l'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

11:27.291 --> 11:29.957
Why wouId anyone murder my grandfather?

11:32.791 --> 11:35.249
l spoke to him on the phone.
Right before it happened.

11:36.958 --> 11:40.790
He was moaning about how
they were ruining Potsdamer Platz.

11:42.208 --> 11:46.999
A testament to bIoodymindedness, cast in
concrete, you know how he used to speak...

11:47.125 --> 11:49.457
l mean, bIoodymindedness...
ls that even a word?

11:49.666 --> 11:51.832
lf he said it, it's a word.

11:56.291 --> 11:57.665
ls your husband not here?

11:59.416 --> 12:01.415
He stayed in London.

12:03.625 --> 12:05.165
And you?

12:06.833 --> 12:08.999
You must be a top attorney by now.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.249
Not reaIly.

12:17.416 --> 12:18.749
Hanna?

12:21.666 --> 12:23.665
l took a case as public defender.

12:24.041 --> 12:25.665
Okay.

12:27.083 --> 12:28.749
ls that a good move for you?

12:32.125 --> 12:34.124
l'm defending Hans's kiIler.

12:37.333 --> 12:38.165
What?

12:39.291 --> 12:41.290
l didn't choose the case.

12:42.333 --> 12:47.124
l didn't even know it was him.
His passport says Jean Baptist, not Hans.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.415
You're not taking the case, of course.

12:51.208 --> 12:55.249
l already took the case.
lt's not that easy to get out of it.

12:58.583 --> 13:00.082
But it's a confIict of interest!

13:00.291 --> 13:01.665
We're not related.

13:04.125 --> 13:06.999
Caspar, you can't defend someone Iike that.

13:48.041 --> 13:51.957
Let's hope the Iast guy didn't
order tomato soup.

13:52.291 --> 13:56.040
lf he did, forget the next 1 0 cups.
Mattinger.

13:56.416 --> 13:59.290
Professor...
l know, l had you in...

13:59.458 --> 14:00.999
CriminaI Iaw.

14:01.125 --> 14:04.624
l Iike to know about my opponent, Mr Leinen.

14:07.500 --> 14:11.749
l'm representing the Meyer famiIy
in the civil case against ColIini.

14:13.791 --> 14:15.290
Tomato soup...

14:17.000 --> 14:21.124
CongratuIations.
lt's a fascinating case.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.249
l fiIed a motion yesterday.
l want to give up the case.

14:28.791 --> 14:32.374
l grew up with the famiIy,
Hans Meyer was Iike a father to me.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.290
l didn't know that.

14:44.916 --> 14:46.915
ExceIlent wording.

14:48.625 --> 14:50.999
l take it this is your first case
that made it to trial?

14:53.750 --> 14:58.999
You know, your next case might remind you
of a tragic experience from your chiIdhood.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.457
Or maybe you don't like your cIient's nose...

15:01.666 --> 15:06.165
...or you think the drugs he soId
make him the worst of the worst.

15:07.625 --> 15:11.957
Do you think personaI opinions
beIong in a courtroom?

15:12.083 --> 15:12.874
No.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.499
You want to be a defense attorney...

15:19.333 --> 15:21.374
Then act Iike one.

16:20.041 --> 16:22.040
This is the public defender, Mr. Leinen.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.915
l'm representing the defendant, CoIIini.

16:26.458 --> 16:28.457
The young man is very committed.

16:29.625 --> 16:30.707
WeII, then...

16:33.000 --> 16:33.957
Right...

16:35.875 --> 16:41.999
The victim is male, 84 years old,
5 foot 1 1 inches, 205 pounds.

16:57.291 --> 17:02.124
The nose is shattered,
presumably from bIunt force...

17:02.333 --> 17:05.332
From the Ieft, to the head...

17:08.458 --> 17:11.957
These injuries were post-mortem.

17:12.250 --> 17:17.290
Blood and fIuid Ieakage,
signs of abrasion in both ears.

17:26.208 --> 17:28.874
3 projectiIes, heaviIy deformed.

17:37.125 --> 17:39.374
Entry wounds cIearIy visible.

17:39.708 --> 17:40.874
l can't do it.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.749
Once more, where does
expectandum come from?

17:57.708 --> 18:00.957
You try to Iook at it as an object,
not as a person.

18:01.458 --> 18:03.999
But you don't aIways succeed.

18:05.625 --> 18:07.165
Expectare...

18:08.333 --> 18:09.915
To expect!

18:12.291 --> 18:14.915
Expecto, expectas...

18:15.041 --> 18:19.582
Expectat, expectamus, expectatis, expectant.

18:23.458 --> 18:25.457
Liver, 2 pounds, 1 3 ounces.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.040
Right Iung, 1 pound, 1 2 ounces.

18:35.041 --> 18:36.957
Left, 1 pound, 6 ounces.

18:40.041 --> 18:42.040
Professor, we're Ieaving.

18:42.416 --> 18:43.665
Thank you.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.457
Heart, 1 pound, 1 ounce...

18:54.250 --> 18:55.332
That's it.

18:58.208 --> 19:02.290
The first shot, front, center...
He was probabIy kneeIing.

19:03.041 --> 19:06.582
The other 2 through
the Ieft side of his face...

19:06.750 --> 19:08.999
...he was already Iying on the ground.

19:13.958 --> 19:18.332
No defensive wounds.
The victim must have been caught unawares.

19:18.625 --> 19:21.999
Since the defendant refuses to make a
statement, we must assume it was intentionaI.

19:22.166 --> 19:23.999
CertainIy premeditated.

19:24.583 --> 19:27.582
Mr. Leinen, this aIl Ieads to a charge
of first-degree murder.

19:28.666 --> 19:29.707
Good night.

19:42.875 --> 19:47.832
BERLIN - MOABIT
STATE PRlSON

21:18.458 --> 21:20.457
You'lI probably be charged with murder.

21:22.291 --> 21:24.665
You could get Iife.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.374
lf a crime has some emotionaI motivation,
it can make a big difference in court.

21:43.041 --> 21:48.124
lmagine you have a shop, and a boy
steals an appIe, then you're angry.

21:50.625 --> 21:56.415
But if the kid teIIs you he hasn't eaten
in two days, you're not so mad, you know?

22:01.791 --> 22:03.582
Why did you do it?

23:01.875 --> 23:05.999
MOTlVE?

23:10.791 --> 23:14.624
lnvestigators have so far been unable
to establish a direct connection...

23:14.791 --> 23:16.915
...between Fabrizio Collini and his victim...

23:17.041 --> 23:21.999
The funeral of the Federal Cross of Merit holder
Hans Meyer will be held today...

23:47.708 --> 23:51.499
Caspar!

23:56.500 --> 23:58.499
How Iong has it been?

23:59.000 --> 24:00.874
Must be 1 0 years.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.874
Since the accident, right?

24:03.666 --> 24:05.665
And now oId Mr. Meyer.

24:07.083 --> 24:08.707
lt's like a curse.

24:11.833 --> 24:13.832
Give me your jacket, I'II iron it for you.

24:36.625 --> 24:39.082
lt's not a museum, off you go!

24:58.625 --> 25:00.832
There you go, good as new!

25:02.750 --> 25:05.874
Johanna, you have to eat something.

25:14.125 --> 25:16.124
You didn't teIl her.

25:17.208 --> 25:19.999
lf you had, she wouId have thrown
that food in your face.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.374
How can you do it?

25:32.958 --> 25:34.999
After everything Grandpa did for you.

25:35.125 --> 25:36.874
l'm an attorney.

25:38.166 --> 25:41.832
lf I was a doctor,
l'd have to save a seriaI kilIer.

25:42.000 --> 25:42.874
Sure.

25:45.833 --> 25:48.832
Do you think it might have
something to do with the MMF?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.124
Who can I ask?

25:52.291 --> 25:54.207
You want me to heIp you now?

25:54.375 --> 26:00.040
Maybe there's a connection to organized crime.
Did Hans ever taIk about blackmaiI attempts?

26:00.208 --> 26:04.415
He wouId never have taken his firm
into grey areas. And you know that.

26:04.625 --> 26:08.457
Not even insider trading?
Some kind of dodgy deaIing?

26:23.625 --> 26:28.290
l'd like to thank you aIl very much
for coming and for your sympathy.

26:30.416 --> 26:35.832
Most of you knew Hans Meyer
as an entrepreneur and a friend...

26:37.041 --> 26:41.582
...but I wouId Iike to say a few words
about my grandfather.

26:43.125 --> 26:47.124
As many of you know,
our family wasn't very big...

26:48.791 --> 26:53.290
And when my parents and my brother
were taken from us far too young...

26:54.166 --> 26:57.124
...he was the onIy person I had.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.707
l'II miss my grandfather very much.

27:08.333 --> 27:15.374
His openness, his patience, his aImost
chiIdIike enthusiasm for oId cars...

27:15.916 --> 27:20.624
...and the words he wouId create,
which he aIways insisted...

27:20.791 --> 27:22.999
...were to be found in the dictionary.

27:25.666 --> 27:29.499
And there was another side to him
that not everyone knew...

27:30.000 --> 27:34.040
He couId Iove without expecting
anything in return.

27:39.416 --> 27:42.665
And anyone he took to his heart...

27:47.833 --> 27:51.415
...was overwheImed with
Iove and generosity.

28:17.083 --> 28:18.499
Guess who!

28:19.625 --> 28:23.624
With those rough hands, you could
onIy be Franz the gardener.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.249
When did you get back?

28:26.416 --> 28:28.374
Stop it!
Get off me!

28:33.583 --> 28:35.040
And who's that?

28:35.208 --> 28:37.124
That's Caspar.

28:37.291 --> 28:41.374
Aha! So you're the hungry caterpilIar
who's moved in and is eating aII our food?

28:43.666 --> 28:48.999
And you're the oIder sister
who's studying art history...

28:49.166 --> 28:52.874
...at the "oh my god"
academy in EngIand.

29:00.791 --> 29:03.999
Oh, no, no, no!
Are you crazy?

30:14.666 --> 30:16.999
What are you doing here, Bernhard?

30:17.166 --> 30:18.957
HelIo, Caspar.

30:19.041 --> 30:22.124
l thought I shouId at
Ieast come to the funeraI...

30:25.208 --> 30:28.999
l wrote you a Ietter after
l heard he was dead.

30:30.333 --> 30:33.249
l wish I had met him.

30:33.875 --> 30:38.040
So you couId throw tomatoes at him
and caII him a capitaIist pig?

30:41.666 --> 30:44.915
To thank him for everything he did for my son.

30:47.958 --> 30:51.374
l taIked to your mother a couple of weeks ago.

30:51.583 --> 30:54.374
She's doing fine in AntaIya,
she's enjoying her retirement...

30:54.583 --> 30:55.665
l know.

30:58.375 --> 31:00.374
l've onIy got a few more years myseIf.

31:00.583 --> 31:02.957
Although, l enjoy
working in the bookstore.

31:03.083 --> 31:05.790
l'd like to keep working, you know?

31:06.083 --> 31:10.874
What are you up to, Bernhard?
This father-son thing?

31:12.875 --> 31:16.165
We tried alI that before, it didn't
work, you have to see that?

31:17.041 --> 31:18.582
We don't even know each other.

31:22.666 --> 31:23.832
Yes...

31:25.916 --> 31:27.082
Okay.

31:28.208 --> 31:29.874
Take care, boy.

31:31.583 --> 31:32.707
Bye.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.624
l often wonder what would have happened
if Philipp hadn't died.

32:19.291 --> 32:22.290
Maybe it wouId have only lasted
that one summer anyway.

32:32.791 --> 32:36.457
l'd have gone back to London,
you were going to start university...

32:38.125 --> 32:40.874
Maybe l'd have appIied to
universities in London.

32:52.625 --> 32:54.915
Maybe we'lI do better this time?

33:44.416 --> 33:45.915
Where were you?

33:46.416 --> 33:47.874
l couIdn't find a parking space.

33:48.041 --> 33:51.499
You caught the triaI of the century and
you're Iooking for a parking space.

33:51.708 --> 33:54.624
l'm not saying you shouId take the bus,
but couIdn't you have caIIed a cab?

34:06.500 --> 34:09.290
UnfortunateIy, we can't make
a statement at this time.

34:09.458 --> 34:11.248
Maybe Iater...

34:57.833 --> 35:04.124
...it is the prosecution's contention that
Fabrizio CoIlini committed this crime...

35:04.291 --> 35:10.374
...brutaIIy, in coId bIood,
with fulI premeditation.

35:12.208 --> 35:16.415
At the same time, we know nothing
about the defendant's motive...

35:16.625 --> 35:23.624
We don't know enough to say whether
the defendant pIanned and committed...

35:24.041 --> 35:24.999
Please stand!

35:25.125 --> 35:26.874
...the crime aIone.

35:27.500 --> 35:31.457
Today, however, onIy
Fabrizio CoIlini is standing triaI...

35:32.291 --> 35:36.207
...and I am convinced that you wiII agree
with the State...

35:36.375 --> 35:40.874
...when we characterize this crime as murder...

35:41.000 --> 35:44.040
...and demand the maximum penaIty.

35:48.333 --> 35:51.415
CounseI for the defense, wouId your
cIient Iike to make a statement?

35:53.958 --> 35:55.040
CounseIlor?

35:55.583 --> 35:56.374
Yes?

35:56.583 --> 35:58.624
Does your client want to speak?

35:58.958 --> 35:59.915
My client doesn't...

36:00.041 --> 36:02.290
WouId you please speak into
the microphone in front of you?

36:09.875 --> 36:12.332
My client doesn't wish to make a statement.

36:17.000 --> 36:22.999
ln addition to the defendant's DNA, we only
found minor traces of one other person...

36:23.125 --> 36:25.374
...on the victim's cIothing.

36:25.583 --> 36:28.915
The second DNA is from his
Iong-time housekeeper.

36:29.500 --> 36:33.332
The defendant's shoes had
remnants of brain matter...

36:34.375 --> 36:36.499
...and even particles of bone.

36:36.708 --> 36:39.082
What did the forensic reports say about those?

36:40.166 --> 36:43.082
They beIonged to Hans Meyer as weIl.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.290
l asked if he was aIright.

36:47.250 --> 36:49.082
He was very quiet.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.290
He had some blood spIattered
on his forehead here...

36:55.875 --> 36:58.040
Then he said, "He's dead."

36:58.750 --> 37:04.707
Was Mr. CoIIini particuIarIy agitated
or emotionaI?

37:04.875 --> 37:05.832
No.

37:07.208 --> 37:10.707
He was kind of vacant...

37:11.875 --> 37:15.124
l don't know if I
shouId say this here, but...

37:17.250 --> 37:20.624
l wouIdn't have been surprised
if he had ordered an espresso.

37:21.958 --> 37:24.832
The Ieft eye was destroyed
and hanging out of its socket...

37:25.250 --> 37:27.124
Cheekbone and nose were destroyed.

37:27.291 --> 37:29.499
ln layman's terms...

37:29.708 --> 37:32.665
ls it easy to break
someone's cheekbone?

37:33.916 --> 37:38.040
The skulI is very soIid.
l assume that...

37:46.041 --> 37:50.207
l assume that the perpetrator kicked
Hans Meyer with fuII force severaI times...

37:50.375 --> 37:51.999
...in the face.

37:54.125 --> 37:56.124
Mattinger is very good at his job.

37:58.583 --> 38:01.082
lf it goes on Iike this,
you'Il die in prison.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.582
Now you Iisten to me, Mr. CoIlini.

38:13.083 --> 38:15.915
Do you know how much
Hans Meyer meant to me?

38:16.625 --> 38:19.624
The man you shot in the head three times...

38:19.875 --> 38:22.874
...and then stamped on his head
untiI your shoe broke.

38:24.833 --> 38:29.499
He was the only one who had time for me
because my mother had to work aII the time...

38:29.708 --> 38:32.207
...and my father Ieft when I was 2.

38:40.791 --> 38:42.165
You know what?

38:43.625 --> 38:45.624
l don't care anymore...

38:46.750 --> 38:48.999
From now on, it's aII by the book.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.124
See you in court.

38:52.208 --> 38:53.874
ls he stiII alive?

38:58.125 --> 38:59.082
Who?

38:59.958 --> 39:02.707
Your father, is he stiII alive?

39:04.750 --> 39:06.749
Yes.
He Iives in Frankfurt.

39:09.458 --> 39:11.874
Do you see each other often?

39:16.833 --> 39:19.790
You shouId see him more.

39:21.083 --> 39:24.415
He won't be there forever.

39:49.916 --> 39:51.915
Why did you kiIl him?

39:55.500 --> 40:00.582
l don't want to cause you any trouble, CounselIor.

40:30.333 --> 40:31.457
Fuck!

41:06.291 --> 41:08.124
Can I have that pizza there?

41:08.291 --> 41:10.165
There's a 1 0 percent discount for take-away

41:10.333 --> 41:13.582
Delivery, pIease.
BrehmstraÃe 3, the name is Leinen.

41:13.833 --> 41:16.499
l can take it.
lt's on my way anyway.

41:24.041 --> 41:25.749
So, you can take me with you.

41:25.916 --> 41:28.874
That's not possible.
lnsurance.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.249
You don't need to worry.

41:30.416 --> 41:32.999
As the delivery driver, you invoice
the pizzeria for your time, right?

41:33.166 --> 41:38.457
That makes you an autonomous subcontractor
so you're legalIy excluded from IiabiIity.

41:38.666 --> 41:40.040
Do you puII this trick often?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.999
My car broke down.

41:53.458 --> 41:54.457
Come on.

42:17.458 --> 42:19.999
What do you do when you're
not deIivering Pizzas?

42:20.583 --> 42:23.624
l'm studying.
Business administration and ltaIian.

42:25.833 --> 42:27.999
Sure, business administration...
l shouId've guessed.

42:28.750 --> 42:30.749
You don't Iook much like a Iawyer either.

42:32.000 --> 42:32.790
Why?

42:33.500 --> 42:36.499
WeII, a Turkish Iawyer?

43:24.458 --> 43:26.832
l'm gIad you could make it.

43:28.250 --> 43:30.957
l was never interested in politics
or the opinion of others...

43:31.083 --> 43:33.915
...unIike many of my coIIeagues.

43:34.041 --> 43:36.499
The Iaw was aIways my top priority.

43:36.958 --> 43:39.249
l always beIieved in the ruIe of Iaw.

43:40.708 --> 43:43.624
And now, after 40 years?
Do you stiII beIieve in it?

43:43.791 --> 43:48.582
l run a Iaw firm with 30 empIoyees,
so it's onIy rarely about the Iaw...

43:48.958 --> 43:55.790
...it's much more about settIements,
deaIs and biIIing as many hours as possibIe.

43:57.708 --> 44:00.249
lt paid for my viIla on Wannsee.

44:09.500 --> 44:14.707
The poIice found a Ietter from CoIlini to Meyer
in which he cIaimed he was a journalist.

44:15.500 --> 44:18.040
That's why Meyer Iet him into the suite
in the first pIace.

44:18.208 --> 44:19.332
l know.

44:20.458 --> 44:22.290
l can forget mansIaughter...

44:28.833 --> 44:31.665
l'd like to make you an offer.

44:35.375 --> 44:38.957
Get CoIlini to confess.

44:41.750 --> 44:43.749
Nobody wants a Iong triaI.

44:43.916 --> 44:46.999
Neither the public prosecutor,
nor the company...

44:47.125 --> 44:50.374
And I guess Johanna Meyer wiII aIso
be gIad when it's alI over.

44:55.250 --> 44:56.749
Can you take the tilIer?

45:03.000 --> 45:04.999
l've known Reimers for a Iong time.

45:05.333 --> 45:07.999
l think if CoIlini confesses...

45:08.166 --> 45:13.374
...l can persuade him to reduce the charges.
Maybe ignore the premeditation.

45:14.916 --> 45:17.040
Which wouId mean mansIaughter.

45:20.125 --> 45:21.665
Pay attention to the wind!

45:44.166 --> 45:48.374
lf you confess in court,
you couId get as IittIe as seven years.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.665
With good behavior,
you're out after 3 or 4 years.

46:00.083 --> 46:01.624
l don't care.

46:10.166 --> 46:14.957
Do you have any idea how much pain
your siIence is causing the reIatives?

46:33.125 --> 46:36.040
How's our confession coming aIong, CounseIlor?

46:36.208 --> 46:38.082
Give me a few more days.

46:39.916 --> 46:41.915
l have compIete faith in you.

46:44.333 --> 46:46.124
You'lI remember your promise?

46:46.875 --> 46:49.624
Of course, the offer stiIl stands.

47:05.666 --> 47:07.707
l don't want to be alone.

47:11.250 --> 47:12.332
Come in.

47:19.375 --> 47:21.790
Mattinger said CoIIini had confessed?

47:24.166 --> 47:25.832
lt's practicaIIy over.

47:49.208 --> 47:50.832
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen...

47:51.000 --> 47:52.915
...we're reporting from the
Berlin Regional Court.

47:53.041 --> 47:56.499
Even after the dramatic confession,
details of the crime remain unclear.

47:56.708 --> 47:59.332
Mr. Mattinger, the case is over
for you, right?

47:59.500 --> 48:03.415
As you know, nothing's certain,
in court and on the high seas.

48:14.750 --> 48:17.832
The baIIistics tests were difficult.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.999
However, the projectiIes
matched the murder weapon.

48:22.583 --> 48:24.832
WaIther P38.

48:26.458 --> 48:31.040
This type of weapon is not typicaI for a
perpetrator connected with organized crime...

48:31.208 --> 48:35.332
... the weapon is quite rare
and has very heavy recoiI.

48:35.833 --> 48:38.374
The defendant refused to make a statement...

48:38.583 --> 48:42.207
...so we know nothing about
how he found the weapon...

48:42.375 --> 48:45.874
...but we assume that he acquired it
on the black market.

48:47.333 --> 48:53.999
The fingerprints on the grip
cIearIy match the defendant...

49:01.291 --> 49:03.707
Excuse me.
Do you have a second?

49:03.875 --> 49:04.874
CounseIlor...

49:05.000 --> 49:08.749
l have a question about the murder weapon.
You said it was rare.

49:08.916 --> 49:09.957
Yes, indeed.

49:10.083 --> 49:12.999
lf I wanted to buy a gun,
any gun on the bIack market...

49:13.333 --> 49:16.874
...wouId I be Iikely to end up
with a WaIther P38?

49:17.000 --> 49:21.374
Almost impossibIe. l'd say you'd
have to Iook for it specificaIIy.

49:22.416 --> 49:24.457
What's your point?

49:26.666 --> 49:28.332
Thank you for your time.

49:37.125 --> 49:40.457
Hey.
Today, I don't want to be aIone.

49:41.708 --> 49:45.499
Okay. Come over.
l'm expecting you.

50:13.708 --> 50:15.207
What are we doing here?

50:15.958 --> 50:17.124
Wait and see.

50:53.208 --> 50:54.874
Wow!

50:55.333 --> 50:57.040
ls it reaI?

50:57.208 --> 50:58.832
l think so.

50:59.750 --> 51:00.999
Can I touch it?

51:11.583 --> 51:12.624
Stop!

51:14.166 --> 51:18.374
You must never enter the library,
and I'm serious!

51:19.791 --> 51:21.457
Never without me!

51:32.000 --> 51:33.124
CounseIlor.

51:33.291 --> 51:34.499
Good morning.

51:34.708 --> 51:37.874
You sIept weIl?
- ExcelIent, why shouIdn't l?

51:38.500 --> 51:40.040
There's no reason not to.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.249
l need a moment with my client, pIease.

51:50.416 --> 51:52.290
The triaI is about to begin.
- It'Il be quick.

51:52.458 --> 51:56.082
What's his probIem now?
- The young man's very jumpy.

52:01.708 --> 52:03.749
l want you to take a Iook at this.

52:08.375 --> 52:11.790
Had you ever seen a weapon
Iike this before the crime, Mr. ColIini?

52:18.791 --> 52:20.457
Mr. CoIIini, pIease!

52:20.916 --> 52:25.374
Why do you torture yourseIf?
Why don't you just teIl me what happened?

52:29.083 --> 52:31.124
Because it doesn't make a difference.

52:31.291 --> 52:32.790
CounseIlor, it's time!

52:32.958 --> 52:34.874
lt does make a difference!
- That's enough!

52:35.000 --> 52:36.707
Mr. CoIIini, I can heIp you.

52:57.083 --> 52:58.457
Please be seated.

53:05.875 --> 53:06.999
Since the defendant...

53:07.166 --> 53:08.999
Your honor!

53:09.583 --> 53:10.374
Yes?

53:10.875 --> 53:12.999
l wouId like to file for continuance
for one week.

53:15.583 --> 53:18.915
CounseIlor, this is ridicuIous!

53:19.041 --> 53:22.249
Dr. Reimers, Professor Mattinger,
Mr. Leinen...

53:22.833 --> 53:24.832
Please join me in my chambers.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.915
The triaI is over for today.

53:35.333 --> 53:37.040
Wasted time.

53:37.375 --> 53:40.082
Mr. Leinen, are you out of your mind?

53:40.250 --> 53:41.957
l need to be sure about one thing.

53:42.083 --> 53:45.915
You wiIl apoIogize to the judge immediateIy
and withdraw your motion.

53:52.958 --> 53:56.624
Right, let's see what our young coIIeague
has on his mind.

53:57.083 --> 54:02.249
Mr. Leinen, are you planning to break
alI the ruIes in your first triaI?

54:05.000 --> 54:06.957
Did you teach him that?

54:07.083 --> 54:10.165
l don't think I can teach Mr. Leinen anything!

54:10.333 --> 54:12.665
Out with it, CounselIor.
What's the purpose of this farce?

54:12.833 --> 54:17.249
There's new evidence regarding my cIient's
motive and I need to investigate it.

54:17.416 --> 54:18.915
What new evidence?

54:26.375 --> 54:27.665
You have four days.

54:29.583 --> 54:30.707
Thank you.

55:02.458 --> 55:03.999
Hey!
- Hey!

55:06.625 --> 55:09.999
Did your car break down again
or have you come to ask me out?

55:10.458 --> 55:13.249
Do you know a place caIled Montecatini?

55:13.666 --> 55:14.999
Nope...

55:20.583 --> 55:21.957
Montecatini?

55:22.458 --> 55:24.124
lt's near Pisa.

55:25.166 --> 55:26.790
l need an interpreter.

55:28.791 --> 55:30.499
l'II pay 1 50 Deutschmarks a day.

55:33.750 --> 55:35.165
Can I deIiver these first?

55:37.250 --> 55:40.082
FederaI Archive Ludwigsburg.

55:40.250 --> 55:43.999

You're in Iuck.
We've got quite a few hits here.

55:48.041 --> 55:49.207
Great!

55:49.416 --> 55:51.999
CouId you send me a copy
of the documents?

55:52.250 --> 55:55.124
We're taIking about more than 300 pages.

55:55.291 --> 55:56.124
Oh!

55:56.291 --> 55:57.499
Per foIder.

55:57.708 --> 55:59.582
Okay, how many foIders are there?

55:59.750 --> 56:01.165
Five.

56:01.333 --> 56:03.165
You'lI have to come by, CounseIlor.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.290
Yes, thank you.
l'II get back to you.

56:06.750 --> 56:10.582
Drive to Ludwigsburg,
read 1 ,500 pages and ItaIy?

56:11.375 --> 56:13.957
How do you want to do alI that in four days?

56:14.083 --> 56:15.832
We'II never get it done on our own.

56:28.750 --> 56:30.415
Leinen Books.

56:35.083 --> 56:36.915
l made the bed..

56:37.875 --> 56:39.874
The toiIet's around the corner.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.082
But...
Where wiII you sIeep?

56:42.833 --> 56:44.999
l've got a good sIeeping bag.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.374
Good night.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.249
l'm realIy glad you're staying over.

57:05.875 --> 57:07.207
No, thank you.

57:09.083 --> 57:11.082
There were no hoteI rooms
because of the trade fair.

57:20.125 --> 57:24.915
So, you have to go to Ludwigsburg, and read
over 1 ,000 pages and you onIy have three days.

57:25.041 --> 57:27.415
l'm a fast reader, I'Il manage.

57:29.750 --> 57:31.040
Thank you.

57:36.791 --> 57:38.790
A IittIe wiId for you, isn't she?

57:41.000 --> 57:43.165
We're coIIeagues.
That's aII.

57:54.208 --> 57:55.415
And you?

57:59.208 --> 58:00.707
Your mother...

58:03.791 --> 58:06.624
The fact that it didn't
work out for us...

58:07.041 --> 58:09.499
l've come to terms with that.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.999
But you and me...

58:39.708 --> 58:44.915
MONTECATINI
TUSCANY - ITALY

58:50.708 --> 58:52.707
Didn't you say you don't speak ItaIian?

58:53.291 --> 58:54.749
l had Latin in schooI.

58:56.125 --> 58:58.999
Keep going Iike that and
you won't need me anymore.

59:29.833 --> 59:34.499
WeII, he only knew an AntoneIla CoIIini,
but she died two months ago.

01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:21.957
An oId woman told me that the guy
who lives here knew CoIIini.

01:00:42.083 --> 01:00:43.665
l speak German.

01:00:46.875 --> 01:00:49.207
l represent Fabrizio CoIIini.

01:00:49.375 --> 01:00:51.207
We were toId you know him.

01:00:51.583 --> 01:00:54.332
Fabrizio.
What is it?

01:00:56.416 --> 01:00:58.082
He's in trouble.

01:00:59.083 --> 01:01:02.040
Does the name Hans Meyer
ring a beIl?

01:01:21.083 --> 01:01:23.290
Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:01:23.458 --> 01:01:24.707
ls Johanna in?

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.332
She's in a meeting in the Iounge.

01:01:29.833 --> 01:01:31.582
You Iook terribIe!

01:01:39.166 --> 01:01:42.415
l must ask you not to taIk to anyone about this.

01:01:46.041 --> 01:01:49.749
There are some unpIeasant detaiIs
about what happened...

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:53.915
...which l wouId like to spare you.

01:01:57.250 --> 01:02:00.915
And for the good of the company,
not a word to Mr. Leinen.

01:02:31.375 --> 01:02:34.415
You aIways Iiked that one, right?

01:02:34.666 --> 01:02:36.957
Hans, l shouId apoIogize...

01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:41.457
lt's a cIassic.

01:02:42.666 --> 01:02:43.957
The shape...

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.999
The straight Iines...

01:02:49.375 --> 01:02:54.374
lf you finish schooI with the grades
you need, it's yours.

01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:00.040
l can't accept that.

01:03:00.208 --> 01:03:03.624
No discussion, Caspar.
l never Iiked driving it anyway.

01:03:04.208 --> 01:03:06.999
lt turns like a ship saiIing in moIasses.

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:08.874
MoIasses?

01:03:45.416 --> 01:03:47.415
l was in Montecatini.

01:03:51.833 --> 01:03:53.832
l know what happened.

01:03:55.583 --> 01:04:00.290
On 1 9 June, 1 944.

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:24.457
Here.
lt was outside on the ground.

01:05:24.958 --> 01:05:26.582
What do you want?

01:05:34.583 --> 01:05:35.749
Nice!

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:38.332
Modern!

01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:51.082
The deviI visits a Iawyer...

01:05:54.166 --> 01:05:56.165
"What can I do for you?"

01:05:56.875 --> 01:05:58.249
"l'm the devil."

01:05:58.583 --> 01:06:01.832
"WeIl, I can see that.
So what can I do for you?"

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:06.207
"Listen", says the deviI.

01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:12.999
"You wilI be the greatest Iawyer of aIl time,
you wiII win every singIe case...

01:06:14.916 --> 01:06:22.999
ln return you'Il give me your souI,
the souIs of your children, your parents...

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.457
...and the souIs of your five best friends."

01:06:31.083 --> 01:06:36.665
The Iawyer looks at the ceiling, thinks for
a moment, leans forward again and says:

01:06:38.666 --> 01:06:42.332
"Fine, but what's the catch?"

01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:56.624
Let it be, young man.

01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:06.249
Your new evidence,
the trump card up your sIeeve...

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:09.624
Leave it where it is.

01:07:11.833 --> 01:07:16.832
The truth, or what you think is the truth,
is of no use to anyone.

01:07:17.125 --> 01:07:19.290
lt'II hurt Johanna Meyer very badIy.

01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:20.832
Leave Johanna out of this.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.790
l'm offering you our deal one Iast time.

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:31.165
Take it. Let CoIIini enjoy a few
more beautifuI summers in ItaIy.

01:07:31.666 --> 01:07:38.499
Meyer Factories are part owners
of a private bank in DusseIdorf.

01:07:39.833 --> 01:07:42.749
lt's facing an insider trading trial
and they'd be happy...

01:07:42.916 --> 01:07:44.790
...if you represented one of the defendants.

01:07:44.958 --> 01:07:50.499
Your daily rate is 2,500 Deutschmarks pIus
expenses. The triaI wiII Iast at Ieast 1 00 days.

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:53.582
You're scared.

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:58.874
You're scared that I won't pIay the roIe
you picked out for me.

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:08.457
See you in court.

01:08:10.375 --> 01:08:14.082
Oh, and pay attention to
detaiIs Iike this...

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:19.040
lt Iooks shabby and harms
our entire profession.

01:08:42.832 --> 01:08:45.332
Sorry I'm Iate.

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:46.915
No problem.

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:49.207
Let's go, I'm hungry.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:51.207
l need to telI you something.

01:08:53.457 --> 01:08:54.790

01:08:56.082 --> 01:08:58.415
They toId me about Hans yesterday.

01:08:58.791 --> 01:09:00.790
lt was so Iong ago.

01:09:01.832 --> 01:09:03.957
lt doesn't heIp anyone to bring that aII up now.

01:09:04.166 --> 01:09:05.707
lt might help ColIini.

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:07.749
lt's not important.

01:09:08.332 --> 01:09:10.332
We are aII that matters now.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.915
l'm going to step down from the company.

01:09:14.041 --> 01:09:15.249
l'd like to take photos again...

01:09:15.416 --> 01:09:18.707
Hanna! l'm going to present the new
evidence at court tomorrow.

01:09:19.207 --> 01:09:20.957
No, you're not.

01:09:22.832 --> 01:09:24.499
l saw you with Mattinger.

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.457
Did he brief you?

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:32.707
Or did you send him here to buy me?
- BulIshit!

01:09:33.666 --> 01:09:35.582
Was it his idea to start things
up with me again after alI this time?

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:37.332
Fuck you, Caspar!

01:09:38.125 --> 01:09:39.582
And what did you do?

01:09:40.375 --> 01:09:43.249
Do you think I didn't notice
you poking around our place?

01:09:43.416 --> 01:09:46.749
l wiIl defend my cIient as best l can.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.415
Don't do it!

01:09:50.791 --> 01:09:52.790
l'm an attorney.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.790
And that's thanks to one man:
my grandfather, and you know it.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.290
And now you want to destroy his reputation?
Without him you'd be working in a kebab shop!

01:10:56.583 --> 01:10:59.249
CalIing Katrin Schwan to the stand.

01:11:00.583 --> 01:11:01.665

Ms. Schwan, thank you for coming.

01:11:18.833 --> 01:11:22.499
You've been at the Federal Archive

01:11:22.708 --> 01:11:25.790
l'm the head of the research unit
"Records/Appraisal."

01:11:25.958 --> 01:11:33.290
Can you telI us if Jean-Baptiste Meyer, born
on March 1 2, 1 91 6, served in WorId War II?

01:11:33.458 --> 01:11:37.749
No! Or rather yes, I can.
He didn't.

01:11:37.958 --> 01:11:38.915
No?

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:41.249
Not under that name.

01:11:42.291 --> 01:11:46.749
There were about 1 6,000 Wehrmacht
personneI with the surname Meyer...

01:11:46.916 --> 01:11:48.790
...with aII of the different speIIings.

He died of a gunshot to the stomach

01:12:10.583 --> 01:12:11.707
And the other one?

01:12:12.375 --> 01:12:18.082
The other Hans Meyer, the same height and
date of birth as Jean-Baptiste Meyer...

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:22.915

01:12:32.666 --> 01:12:33.707

01:12:33.875 --> 01:12:35.040

01:12:35.208 --> 01:12:36.832
Didn't you?
- No.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.749
Order, please.
Thank you.

01:12:54.875 --> 01:12:58.374
l have no further questions.
Thank you, Ms. Schwan.

01:12:59.833 --> 01:13:01.832
WouId the prosecution care to cross examine?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.124
GentIemen?

01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:05.457
Thank you.

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:13.249
Your honor! The defense wouId Iike to
caII Mr. CIaudio Lucchesi to the stand.

01:13:13.416 --> 01:13:17.249
One moment, pIease.
That name is not on the witness Iist.

01:13:17.583 --> 01:13:22.249
CounseI for the defense, l must urge you
to stick to the usuaI procedures.

01:13:22.416 --> 01:13:24.999
The witness has travelIed up from the

01:13:25.125 --> 01:13:26.457
l onIy just found out he had arrived.

01:13:28.916 --> 01:13:31.915
Alright, but just this once, Mr. Leinen.

01:13:32.125 --> 01:13:35.249
So, caIIing the witness...

01:13:38.333 --> 01:13:40.165
Mr. CIaudio Lucchesi, pIease.

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.040
Do we need an interpreter?

01:13:42.208 --> 01:13:43.915
The witness speaks German.

01:14:06.958 --> 01:14:12.999

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:19.332

Mr. Lucchesi, may I first ask if

01:14:31.791 --> 01:14:33.124
Of course.

01:14:33.625 --> 01:14:35.624
But initiaIIy you didn't want to.

01:14:37.291 --> 01:14:38.165
No.

01:14:38.875 --> 01:14:40.290
Why not?

01:14:42.708 --> 01:14:44.707
You can't turn back time.

01:14:47.416 --> 01:14:49.749
Your father's name was Alberto Lucchesi.

01:14:49.958 --> 01:14:50.915

01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:26.915
ColIaboration with the Germans.

01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:31.582
He was aIso an interpreter.

01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:32.915
Name?

01:16:15.625 --> 01:16:16.665
Please.

01:16:40.791 --> 01:16:42.790
You needn't be afraid of me.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.332
l just Iike to get to know alI of my employees.

01:16:59.291 --> 01:17:00.790
What was the officer's name?

01:17:02.833 --> 01:17:04.832
Hans Meyer.

01:17:07.583 --> 01:17:10.457
Quiet!
Quiet, please.

01:17:12.041 --> 01:17:14.499
WouId the prosecution
Iike to make a statement?

01:17:14.708 --> 01:17:15.290
Yes.

01:17:15.458 --> 01:17:21.999
The counseI for the defense is cIearIy trying
to bIacken the name of Jean-Baptiste Meyer...

01:17:22.166 --> 01:17:27.082
...and distract from the fact that Mr. Meyer
is the victim in this triaI.

01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:29.707
Let's not forget that, pIease.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.665
CounseIlor?

01:17:32.041 --> 01:17:34.999
Mr. Lucchesi, you said that your father
Alberto was sentenced to death...

01:17:35.166 --> 01:17:39.040
...for coIlaboration with the Germans,
even though he was onIy an interpreter.

01:17:40.041 --> 01:17:41.707
lt's hard to understand.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.582
On a Iate summer's day in 1 944,
at around 1 0 in the evening...

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:54.040
...a bomb exploded in
the Cafe Trento in Pisa.

01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:57.915
lt kiIIed two German soIdiers.

01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:02.082
A Partisan assassination.

01:18:03.791 --> 01:18:08.082
Everyone knew what the
Germans' response wouId be.

01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:15.374
The peopIe are protecting these partisans.

01:18:17.291 --> 01:18:18.624
lt's obvious.

01:18:19.041 --> 01:18:23.332
And so, as of today,
we wiIl proceed as foIIows:

01:18:24.875 --> 01:18:31.082
For every German kiIled,
1 0 partisans wilI die.

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:36.124
Or supporters, hostages...

01:18:36.625 --> 01:18:40.999
...and anyone who even Iooks Iike he's
thinking of protecting these bandits.

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:44.082
Ten for one.

01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:47.499
lt's the onIy way to break the resistance.

01:18:49.166 --> 01:18:50.332
Ten for one!

01:18:57.666 --> 01:19:01.915
Lucchesi, wouId you Iike to pIay God?

01:19:05.166 --> 01:19:07.499
Mr. SturmbannfÃ¼hrer, pIease no!

01:19:07.875 --> 01:19:09.415
Then you do it.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.582
What about... here!

01:19:32.250 --> 01:19:33.874
Montecatini.

01:19:41.916 --> 01:19:43.082
Yes, Sir!

01:19:43.958 --> 01:19:45.957
Ten for one.

01:19:47.833 --> 01:19:50.415
20 civilians shot dead...

01:19:52.166 --> 01:19:55.790
...in retaIiation for the 2 German soIdiers.

01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:02.374
Bring them here.

01:21:02.583 --> 01:21:03.582
Let's go!

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:11.457
Open up!

01:21:45.375 --> 01:21:46.624
Buona sera.

01:22:04.458 --> 01:22:05.874
HelIo there...

01:22:43.875 --> 01:22:45.874
We don't like doing this.

01:22:47.666 --> 01:22:48.957
Louder!

01:22:52.375 --> 01:22:53.999
But we hope...

01:22:58.166 --> 01:23:00.290
...that in future these partisans...

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.499
...wiIl not find sheIter and help.

01:23:18.666 --> 01:23:19.832
No chiIdren!

01:23:21.416 --> 01:23:23.499
Quiet!
You, too!

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.207
You idiot!

01:23:45.583 --> 01:23:47.165
Don't worry, my boy.

01:23:52.916 --> 01:23:54.207
What's your name?

01:23:57.958 --> 01:23:59.957
Fabrizio CoIlini.

01:24:19.333 --> 01:24:21.332
Mr. CoIIini?

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:25.874
WouId you be wiIIing to testify?

01:24:37.458 --> 01:24:40.374
The defense caIls Fabrizio CoIIini.

01:24:46.375 --> 01:24:49.749
Mr. CoIIini?
Take the stand, pIease.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.749
Thank you, Mr Lucchesi.

01:25:16.375 --> 01:25:18.374
What happened then, Mr. CoIIini?

01:25:19.958 --> 01:25:24.499
Then he asked me about my father.

01:25:25.958 --> 01:25:27.624
Where's your father?

01:25:45.166 --> 01:25:46.207
Good...

01:25:47.916 --> 01:25:48.999
The father.

01:25:59.708 --> 01:26:03.874
But he says his father had nothing to do with it!
He's not a partisan!

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:19.499
Ready!

01:26:25.083 --> 01:26:27.082
Get over there.
ln a row.

01:26:29.708 --> 01:26:31.332
Aim!

01:26:32.916 --> 01:26:34.082
1 8...

01:26:34.916 --> 01:26:36.082
1 9...

01:26:37.666 --> 01:26:38.624
20.

01:26:41.833 --> 01:26:42.749
Fire!

01:26:46.916 --> 01:26:48.915
Ready!

01:26:50.875 --> 01:26:52.374
Aim!

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.082
Fire!

01:27:20.458 --> 01:27:23.249
The court wiII recess for half an hour.

01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:35.124
Thank you.

01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:36.874
Thank you, goodbye.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.290
Come on.
See you Iater.

01:27:39.458 --> 01:27:40.665
See you Iater.

01:27:42.416 --> 01:27:44.415
l'II be with you in a second.

01:27:47.875 --> 01:27:50.499
You know exactly what kind
of person my grandfather was.

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:53.790
He was foIlowing orders.

01:28:05.875 --> 01:28:08.582
The counseI for the civil claim
has asked to make a statement.

01:28:08.833 --> 01:28:11.124
Go ahead, Professor Mattinger.

01:28:14.125 --> 01:28:20.457
The counciI for the defense has
vividIy demonstrated that in 1 944...

01:28:20.666 --> 01:28:30.707
...near Pisa, a 1 0-foId retaliation was inflicted
on civilians, in response to a Partisan attack.

01:28:32.916 --> 01:28:35.249
By the way, this form of retaIiation
was not unusuaI...

01:28:35.416 --> 01:28:39.457
...and was not onIy used by
German forces in World War Il.

01:28:40.083 --> 01:28:47.749
We cannot imagine the suffering
of the victims and their famiIies.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.165
But...

01:28:55.208 --> 01:28:57.915
As tragic as it is...

01:28:59.208 --> 01:29:03.665
...this kind of hostage shooting
was not an isoIated incident.

01:29:05.375 --> 01:29:09.790
ln certain circumstances, these punitive
measures were in accordance...

01:29:09.958 --> 01:29:11.957
...with internationaI Iaw...

01:29:12.083 --> 01:29:18.749
...namely when no women and children
were affected by the retaIiatory action.

01:29:19.875 --> 01:29:22.999
No women, no chiIdren.

01:29:26.583 --> 01:29:27.915
ls that correct, Mr Leinen?

01:29:29.833 --> 01:29:31.624
ln rare cases, yes.

01:29:35.583 --> 01:29:37.874
Things happen in war...

01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:43.290
...that we cannot and do not
want to imagine here.

01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:46.790
But...

01:29:47.166 --> 01:29:51.374
...whether or not Jean-Baptiste Meyer
committed a war crime...

01:29:52.125 --> 01:29:55.582
...is a question for a miIitary tribunaI.

01:29:57.125 --> 01:30:00.790
Why didn't you fiIe
a compIaint against him...

01:30:00.958 --> 01:30:03.999
...instead of taking the law
into your own hands?

01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:06.999
WouIdn't that have been the way to proceed?

01:30:10.166 --> 01:30:11.457
l think it wouId.

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:22.582
However...

01:30:24.708 --> 01:30:32.999
lsn't it true that you and your sister fiIed
a criminal compIaint against Meyer in 1 968?

01:30:39.083 --> 01:30:41.040
Recess, pIease.
l have to taIk to my...

01:30:41.208 --> 01:30:42.249
No!

01:30:47.916 --> 01:30:48.915
And?

01:30:57.583 --> 01:30:59.582
What happened with the complaint?

01:31:07.708 --> 01:31:10.749
ln the summer of 1 969...

01:31:11.041 --> 01:31:17.582
...the pubIic prosecutor's office suspended
the investigation of Jean-Baptiste Meyer.

01:31:19.208 --> 01:31:21.499
ln this case, the truth is quite simpIe.

01:31:21.708 --> 01:31:26.165
Jean-Baptiste Meyer was not guilty,
there was no war crime.

01:31:26.833 --> 01:31:30.415
Those were terribIe times.
Period.

01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:35.790
You, Mr. ColIini,
murdered an innocent man.

01:31:42.291 --> 01:31:44.082
Today's session is over.

01:31:46.083 --> 01:31:48.082
l'm sorry you had to hear aIl that again.

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.290
Why didn't you teII me?

01:32:07.833 --> 01:32:11.040
That's the game, Leinen.
Don't take it personaIly.

01:32:43.125 --> 01:32:45.999
When the compIaint was rejected...

01:32:46.166 --> 01:32:49.999
...my sister made me swear that
l'd never try anything again.

01:32:50.458 --> 01:32:53.249
Never talk to anyone about it again.

01:32:54.166 --> 01:32:56.874
"For as long as I'm alive", she said.

01:32:58.833 --> 01:33:01.832
She Iived with the pain
for more than thirty years.

01:33:03.625 --> 01:33:05.249
UntiI two months ago.

01:33:08.166 --> 01:33:09.957
l hope you understand me...

01:33:12.041 --> 01:33:15.290
l understand...
WeII, I think.

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:20.207
l know this isn't easy for you, CounselIor.

01:33:21.166 --> 01:33:24.165
l wanted to apoIogize.

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.499
l'm the one who should apoIogize.

01:33:29.833 --> 01:33:32.707
lf you had a better Iawyer, you'd have
been a free man in three years.

01:33:35.250 --> 01:33:37.124
l'm not interested in that.

01:33:40.291 --> 01:33:44.624
l don't have a famiIy anymore, no kids.

01:33:47.958 --> 01:33:50.374
AlI I want is justice.

01:33:55.333 --> 01:33:58.999
How couId they dismiss the compIaint
against Meyer?

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:04.874
What Iaw was on his side?

01:34:19.416 --> 01:34:23.499
What Iaw, CounselIor?

01:34:35.416 --> 01:34:37.415
This is the originaI verdict.

01:35:01.208 --> 01:35:04.582
BONN, MAY 24 1 968

01:35:06.208 --> 01:35:10.499
VOTE IN THE
GERMAN BUNDESTAG

01:35:10.708 --> 01:35:15.624
ACT ON ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENCES

01:35:15.791 --> 01:35:20.832
THE FOLLOWlNG ACT lS VOTED lNTO LAW...

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.415
MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT
GEORG LEBER

01:35:22.625 --> 01:35:24.790
MINISTER FOR JUSTICE
DR. HElNEMANN

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.832
DEPUTY CHANCELLOR
WILLY BRANDT

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.582
PRESlDENT
LÃBKE

01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:42.124
Look at this!

01:35:57.625 --> 01:35:59.249
Good morning, CounseIIor!

01:35:59.416 --> 01:36:01.249
l'm sorry, your honor.

01:36:02.416 --> 01:36:06.332
l'm so glad you were abIe to take time away
from uncovering surprise witnesses.

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:09.499
We were afraid you wouIdn't make it to court!

01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:14.415
l do have a surprise witness, your honor.

01:36:14.875 --> 01:36:17.582
But the person l wouId like to calI is
already here in the court room.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.874
And who wouId that be?

01:36:22.375 --> 01:36:24.749
Professor Richard Mattinger.

01:36:26.458 --> 01:36:30.790
But l don't want to caII him as a witness,
but as an expert on legal history.

01:36:31.708 --> 01:36:35.499
Again, this is not the usual procedure.

01:36:35.708 --> 01:36:37.624
You don't have to do this,
Professor Mattinger.

01:36:37.791 --> 01:36:39.415
l know.

01:36:43.583 --> 01:36:46.207
But if it heIps us to find the truth...

01:36:46.375 --> 01:36:48.832
Do you want me to sit in the witness chair?

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.499
That's not necessary.

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:56.249
Maybe it's not bad to change my perspective.
See the room from the other side!

01:37:02.083 --> 01:37:04.082
ShalI we, CounselIor?

01:37:08.041 --> 01:37:12.582
Professor Mattinger, when did you
pass the bar? 1 968?

01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:13.707
Correct.

01:37:14.375 --> 01:37:16.832
Were you a good Iawyer from the beginning?

01:37:19.625 --> 01:37:21.499
Please, CounseIIor...

01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:29.207
One couId say that you've aIways been on
the side of Iaw, order and justice, right?

01:37:30.333 --> 01:37:37.582
WeII, I was once ticketed for speeding on
HohenzoIIerndamm. I was 8 mph over the limit.

01:37:39.833 --> 01:37:42.999
My only 'offence' in that direction, if you wiII.

01:37:43.125 --> 01:37:47.707
l was on my way to a friend's wedding
and a littIe Iate. I was the best man.

01:37:50.333 --> 01:37:53.040
Let's taIk about Doctor Eduard Dreher.

01:37:56.375 --> 01:37:58.749
Was that a question?
- Not yet.

01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:01.499
Please, gentlemen.

01:38:03.708 --> 01:38:10.040
Professor Mattinger, the compIaint against
Jean-Baptiste Meyer was not suspended...

01:38:10.208 --> 01:38:14.082
...because the execution of the hostages
was IegaI, isn't that right?

01:38:15.458 --> 01:38:19.124
The state prosecutor did not make
a judgment on that.

01:38:19.375 --> 01:38:22.999
Exactly.
Because there was a different reason.

01:38:23.916 --> 01:38:27.374
Fabrizio CoIlini waited untiI his mother died...

01:38:27.791 --> 01:38:32.124
Then, together with his sister AntoneIIa, he filed
a compIaint against Jean-Baptiste Meyer...

01:38:32.291 --> 01:38:34.290
...in early 1 969.

01:38:35.041 --> 01:38:40.957
The two did everything that the ruIe of law
expected of them and then got this answer:

01:38:42.083 --> 01:38:44.374
"The matter wiII not be investigated."

01:38:46.875 --> 01:38:52.165
And this was due to a law that came
into force at the end of 1 968.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.999
Almost 25 years after the massacre...

01:38:55.166 --> 01:38:59.165
...but just 4 months before the sibIings
fiIed charges against Meyer.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.624
"Introductory Law to the Law on
Administrative Offences."

01:39:08.250 --> 01:39:09.999
Quite a mouthful, isn't it.

01:39:10.166 --> 01:39:12.749
So your first serious question...

01:39:12.916 --> 01:39:17.332
...is about how easily the name of an
obscure Iaw trips off the tongue?

01:39:20.291 --> 01:39:23.249
Doctor Eduard Dreher
was the author of the Iaw.

01:39:24.125 --> 01:39:28.707
During the Nazi regime he was the Senior Public
Prosecutor at the special court in Innsbruck.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.915
He argued for the death penaIty if someone,
for exampIe, stoIe food.

01:39:34.041 --> 01:39:34.915
Right?

01:39:35.083 --> 01:39:37.082
He was quite drastic, yes.

01:39:39.416 --> 01:39:43.499
ln 1 951 , Dreher was appointed to the
FederaI Ministry of Justice?

01:39:43.708 --> 01:39:45.832
And another question, yes!

01:39:46.666 --> 01:39:51.040
The same Dr. Eduard Dreher became head
of the criminaI justice department here?

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:54.999
Whatever you're trying to suggest...

01:39:55.166 --> 01:39:59.124
...he wasn't the onIy Nazi who made
a career under Adenauer.

01:39:59.291 --> 01:40:02.790
When CoIlini's cIaim was rejected in 1 969...

01:40:02.958 --> 01:40:06.707
...the IegaI basis for that decision
was what, five lines from that law?

01:40:10.041 --> 01:40:13.374
WouId you mind teIIing us
what exactIy it means?

01:40:13.666 --> 01:40:15.582
ln simpIe words?

01:40:18.125 --> 01:40:23.749
To put it very simply, it meant that
the crime of accessory to murder...

01:40:24.625 --> 01:40:27.999
...in certain cases, was to be punished
as mansIaughter, not murder.

01:40:28.166 --> 01:40:29.582
Which meant?

01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:35.207
That in certain cases, accessory to murder was
to be punished as mansIaughter, not murder.

01:40:35.375 --> 01:40:37.999
What did this mean in practice?

01:40:38.125 --> 01:40:40.499
l toId you!
Twice!

01:40:41.083 --> 01:40:43.957
l want everyone in the room to understand it.

01:40:48.666 --> 01:40:52.915
lt meant that such crimes committed during the
war wouId faIl under the statute of limitations...

01:40:53.041 --> 01:40:55.582
...and the perpetrators couId
no Ionger be prosecuted.

01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:58.582
Because the statute of Iimitations
for mansIaughter is 20 years.

01:40:59.166 --> 01:41:00.999
ln contrast to murder.

01:41:05.708 --> 01:41:12.832
lt meant that an officer Iike Hans Meyer
who indiscriminateIy executed civilians...

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:17.874
...his crime was cIassified as mansIaughter.
And he wouId get away with it...

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.832
...because the statute of Iimitations
for mansIaughter had aIready passed.

01:41:21.333 --> 01:41:23.790
How many got away because of this law?

01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:27.374
How many of the senior kiIIers
who sat behind the desks?

01:41:27.583 --> 01:41:31.249
And ordered the extermination
of aImost aIl the Jews in Europe?

01:41:31.416 --> 01:41:34.249
They had nothing to worry
about anymore, right?

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.582
lt doesn't change a thing,
ColIini kiIled an innocent man.

01:41:38.791 --> 01:41:40.707
Yes, Iet's taIk about guiIt.

01:41:40.875 --> 01:41:42.874
Your honor, l've no idea what this...

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:49.124
Mr Mattinger, did you serve as an intern in the
Ministry of Justice in Bonn in the mid-sixties?

01:41:51.875 --> 01:41:53.165
Yes.
So?

01:41:53.333 --> 01:41:58.207
ls it true that you took part in meetings
where this Iaw was discussed?

01:42:10.416 --> 01:42:11.457
The minutes of the meeting.

01:42:18.375 --> 01:42:22.207
Can you remember if it was unpIeasant
to work on this Iaw...

01:42:22.375 --> 01:42:24.457
Yes, some sessions were quite Iong.

01:42:30.250 --> 01:42:35.332
To work on a Iaw that meant that crimes
Iike these were suddenIy beyond prosecution?

01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:38.249
lt was a different time back then.

01:42:38.416 --> 01:42:40.582
Perhaps you see it differentIy today?

01:42:41.291 --> 01:42:43.290
Do you think Meyer was guilty?

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:48.915
Was it just that Meyer couId never
be brought before a court for his crimes?

01:42:49.041 --> 01:42:50.415
lt was the Iaw.

01:42:50.916 --> 01:42:54.749
That's what we discuss here.
Nothing eIse, young man.

01:42:57.041 --> 01:43:01.040
You're standing here, protected by
the grace of your late birth...

01:43:01.208 --> 01:43:04.999
...and want to nail me to a Iaw
that was drafted at the same time...

01:43:05.125 --> 01:43:07.499
...l happened to be employed
by the same authority?

01:43:09.208 --> 01:43:11.999
Have you got the sIightest idea?

01:43:12.416 --> 01:43:17.665
Can you even begin to imagine
how this country worked back then?

01:43:18.958 --> 01:43:22.957
ln the end, our job was to respect the law.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.582
l've aIways done that.

01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:27.624
The Iaw was a scandaI.

01:43:29.708 --> 01:43:36.665
And if you didn't have the courage to
stand up and say it then, at Ieast do it now.

01:43:46.833 --> 01:43:48.249
Ready!

01:43:53.208 --> 01:43:55.207
Aim!

01:43:56.708 --> 01:43:58.374
This law...

01:43:59.958 --> 01:44:00.999
Was it just?

01:44:03.583 --> 01:44:04.624
Fire!

01:44:13.291 --> 01:44:17.165
No-one is disputing that CoIIini
took the Iaw into his own hands.

01:44:18.625 --> 01:44:22.624
But was it just that no charges
were brought against Meyer?

01:44:25.833 --> 01:44:28.832
Don't we have to judge
ColIini's deed differentIy?

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:35.165
Stand by!

01:44:41.250 --> 01:44:43.874
You must learn to be brave.

01:44:44.291 --> 01:44:49.707
You must learn to be brave, Hans Meyer.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.915
Aim!

01:44:57.166 --> 01:44:58.082
Fire!

01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:09.999
Was it just, Mr. Mattinger?

01:46:38.625 --> 01:46:40.624
ls this the rule of Iaw we beIieve in?

01:47:02.666 --> 01:47:03.457
No.

01:47:06.291 --> 01:47:08.290
Of course not.

01:47:11.041 --> 01:47:13.790
According to our current understanding
of internationaI law...

01:47:13.958 --> 01:47:17.749
...Jean-Baptiste Meyer shouId have
been charged and convicted.

01:47:17.916 --> 01:47:20.124
For a war crime, is that correct?

01:47:24.875 --> 01:47:26.332
That's right, yes.

01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:34.499
l've no further questions, your honor.

01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:43.624
The court is in recess for today.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.790
Tomorrow we'II hear cIosing arguments,
and then we'lI pass sentence.

01:48:02.458 --> 01:48:03.999
lt's over.

01:48:09.791 --> 01:48:12.957
The dead don't want revenge.

01:48:16.625 --> 01:48:19.374
Thank you, CounseIIor.

01:49:47.250 --> 01:49:49.249
Am I aIl that, too?

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.999
You are who you are.

01:50:53.625 --> 01:50:56.290
We're reporting Iive from outside the court,
and today is the Iong-awaited day.

01:50:56.458 --> 01:50:59.999
We're expecting to hear the verdict in
the ColIini case that has gripped the nation.

01:51:00.125 --> 01:51:03.374
After yesterday's expIosive revelations,
the question on everyone's Iips is:

01:51:03.583 --> 01:51:05.415
How wiII the judges ruIe?

01:51:05.625 --> 01:51:09.874
lt's a true legal diIemma.
Stay tuned for more breaking news.

01:51:44.666 --> 01:51:49.749
The defendant, Fabrizio Maria CoIlini,
took his own life in his celI last night.

01:51:49.916 --> 01:51:50.832
Shit!

01:51:52.208 --> 01:51:57.165
The coroner pronounced him dead at 2:40 a.m.

01:51:58.125 --> 01:52:00.457
l therefore have the foIlowing
decision to announce:

01:52:01.708 --> 01:52:04.665
The proceedings against the accused
are cIosed.

01:52:04.916 --> 01:52:07.207
The costs wiII be borne by the state.

01:52:07.375 --> 01:52:11.624
Ladies and gentIemen,
this hearing is cIosed.

01:52:45.625 --> 01:52:49.707
CASPAR LElNEN
ATTORNEY

01:53:02.208 --> 01:53:03.124
Hi!

01:53:03.458 --> 01:53:04.374
Hey!

01:53:06.750 --> 01:53:07.790
Your mail...

01:53:08.041 --> 01:53:10.040
Your father calIed,
you shouId caII him back.

01:53:10.208 --> 01:53:11.999
And your fIight is Ieaving soon.

01:53:12.166 --> 01:53:15.957
Listen, what did we say about
appropriate cIothing at work?

01:53:33.250 --> 01:53:37.499
THIS WAS OUR FATHER
FABRIZlO COLLINI

01:55:53.375 --> 01:55:58.415
Hundreds of thousands of civiIians were
indiscriminateIy murdered by the SS...

01:55:58.625 --> 01:56:03.290
...and the German army in the Second
WorId War during "retaIiatory" measures.

01:56:06.208 --> 01:56:13.665
ln 1 968 the so-caIIed "Dreher Law"
was passed by the German Bundestag.

01:56:17.291 --> 01:56:24.415
This law alIowed countless war criminaIs
to escape justice.
