00:05.040 --> 00:08.119
&lrm;<i>Just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

00:08.240 --> 00:10.840
&lrm;<i>But there's something about me</i>
&lrm;<i>that no one knows yet.</i>

00:10.960 --> 00:12.440
&lrm;<i>Because I have a secret.</i>

00:30.960 --> 00:34.480
&lrm;Marinette!
&lrm;This is quite a special day for you.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.760
&lrm;Yes, Tikki, it sure is!

00:37.600 --> 00:39.720
&lrm;Hmm. Still no call.

00:41.760 --> 00:44.360
&lrm;There's a ritual
&lrm;we kwamis perform on a day like this.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.920
&lrm;Oh! Really? That's nice!

00:47.040 --> 00:49.440
&lrm;But I don't know
&lrm;if you humans would like it.

00:49.560 --> 00:52.880
&lrm;I wonder if you guys even give each other
&lrm;presents on your birthday.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.520
&lrm;Oh! Really, Tikki?
&lrm;You got me a birthday present?

00:55.640 --> 01:00.080
&lrm;-A kwami specialty.
&lrm;-Oh, that's so awesome! What it is?

01:00.480 --> 01:03.080
&lrm;[sings]

01:08.000 --> 01:10.080
&lrm;Miraculous birthday, Marinette!

01:11.000 --> 01:12.760
&lrm;Ugh!

01:12.880 --> 01:16.840
&lrm;-Oh, no! You don't like it, do you?
&lrm;-Yes, yes! I love it!

01:16.960 --> 01:19.760
&lrm;It's amazing, it's... What is it?

01:19.880 --> 01:23.680
&lrm;A kwagatama! A great symbol of friendship
&lrm;among us kwamis!

01:23.800 --> 01:25.960
&lrm;We take a hair from our Miraculous holder,

01:26.080 --> 01:28.840
&lrm;and join it to the hairs
&lrm;of all former Miraculous holders

01:28.960 --> 01:32.840
&lrm;and, with them, we grow a magic resin
&lrm;for a few months and...

01:35.920 --> 01:39.000
&lrm;I know you don't want to tell me
&lrm;not to hurt my feelings,

01:39.120 --> 01:41.120
&lrm;but it's obvious you don't like it.

01:41.240 --> 01:44.600
&lrm;I'm sorry, Tikki! I really love your gift!
&lrm;It's just that...

01:44.720 --> 01:46.640
&lrm;Alya should have called me by now!

01:46.760 --> 01:50.680
&lrm;We're supposed to be taking her little
&lrm;sisters to the dentist at four o'clock!

01:50.800 --> 01:55.240
&lrm;Do you humans always celebrate
&lrm;your birthday by going to the dentist?

01:55.360 --> 01:58.640
&lrm;No, of course not, Tikki!
&lrm;It's a secret code!

01:58.760 --> 02:01.560
&lrm;They're throwing me
&lrm;a surprise birthday party!

02:01.680 --> 02:04.840
&lrm;But how can it be a surprise,
&lrm;if you know about it?

02:04.960 --> 02:08.039
&lrm;You know about the surprise,
&lrm;but you pretend you don't,

02:08.160 --> 02:10.520
&lrm;so you won't spoil it
&lrm;for those organising it!

02:10.639 --> 02:13.160
&lrm;-What about the dentist?
&lrm;-It's a fake-out!

02:13.280 --> 02:15.920
&lrm;See, Alya's gonna pretend
&lrm;to take me to the dentist's,

02:16.040 --> 02:19.040
&lrm;but she'll&lrm;<i> really</i>&lrm; be taking me
&lrm;to my surprise party!

02:19.160 --> 02:20.400
&lrm;But what if you're wrong?

02:20.520 --> 02:23.200
&lrm;Impossible!
&lrm;All the signs are there, Tikki!

02:23.520 --> 02:26.600
&lrm;<i>Juleka jumped when I caught her</i>
&lrm;<i>holding a bicycle pump!</i>

02:32.760 --> 02:36.080
&lrm;-Perhaps Juleka has a bicycle?
&lrm;-No, Tikki!

02:36.200 --> 02:39.320
&lrm;Obviously, she was planning
&lrm;to use the pump to blow up balloons!

02:39.440 --> 02:41.920
&lrm;A surprise birthday party always
&lrm;has balloons!

02:42.440 --> 02:46.440
&lrm;Also, yesterday, I caught Nino
&lrm;listening to&lrm;<i> my</i>&lrm; favourite song!

02:49.160 --> 02:51.440
&lrm;Perhaps it's his favourite song too?

02:51.560 --> 02:56.040
&lrm;Are you kidding? He hates it! He has
&lrm;no reason to listen to it unless...

02:56.160 --> 02:59.840
&lrm;he's making a playlist
&lrm;for my surprise party! Elementary!

03:01.520 --> 03:06.240
&lrm;OK. If you don't believe me, why was Alya
&lrm;having a secret convo with Adrien, huh?

03:07.440 --> 03:11.520
&lrm;Yes, Alya, I know a very good dentist
&lrm;and here's his number!

03:11.640 --> 03:14.840
&lrm;Which means he's going to be there!

03:14.960 --> 03:19.040
&lrm;Or it means Alya is taking her sisters
&lrm;to see Adrien's dentist!

03:19.160 --> 03:23.120
&lrm;Ugh! Fine. You know what?
&lrm;There's one no-fail way to find out

03:23.240 --> 03:25.440
&lrm;if there's a surprise party in the making!

03:25.560 --> 03:26.720
&lrm;Watch their faces.

03:27.320 --> 03:31.960
&lrm;Mom! Dad! Do you know anything about
&lrm;Alya planning a party for my birthday?

03:32.080 --> 03:33.080
&lrm;Uh...

03:33.200 --> 03:36.280
&lrm;Oh! Party? Uh... what party?

03:36.400 --> 03:38.400
&lrm;Uh, which Alya again?

03:38.520 --> 03:41.560
&lrm;You're overdoing it.
&lrm;We're talking about her best friend!

03:41.680 --> 03:45.800
&lrm;Alya! Of course! Alya!
&lrm;We haven't seen her in years!

03:46.080 --> 03:46.960
&lrm;[nervous laugh]

03:47.080 --> 03:47.800
&lrm;[groans]

03:47.920 --> 03:51.160
&lrm;See? Parents always know
&lrm;when there's a surprise party!

03:51.280 --> 03:52.720
&lrm;[door bell rings]

03:52.840 --> 03:56.400
&lrm;And now, on the other side of this door,
&lrm;check out who's coming to get me,

03:56.520 --> 03:59.120
&lrm;just in time for the party. It's...

03:59.240 --> 04:01.000
&lrm;Grandma?

04:01.120 --> 04:02.920
&lrm;-Mom?
&lrm;-Gina?

04:04.000 --> 04:09.080
&lrm;Marinetta! You're so tall for your age!
&lrm;Did you get my letter from Patagonia?

04:09.200 --> 04:12.000
&lrm;Yes. And the ones from Australia,
&lrm;Bali and Estonia, too!

04:12.120 --> 04:15.520
&lrm;-Did you really get chased by a bear?
&lrm;-Ha, ha, ha!

04:15.640 --> 04:18.320
&lrm;Yes, but we wound up
&lrm;good friends in the end!

04:18.440 --> 04:22.480
&lrm;-Mom, it's her birthday, remember?
&lrm;-Why do you think I'm here?

04:23.880 --> 04:26.360
&lrm;Happy birthday, my fairy!

04:26.480 --> 04:30.640
&lrm;My Inuit friend knitted it
&lrm;especially for your tenth birthday!

04:30.760 --> 04:34.400
&lrm;-Uh... She's 14.
&lrm;-My! How time flies!

04:37.320 --> 04:40.920
&lrm;That's OK. I'll ask my friends
&lrm;to make another one.

04:41.040 --> 04:45.320
&lrm;No, no, it's... awesome! I can make this
&lrm;work. It's perfect, Grandma. Thank you!

04:45.440 --> 04:49.280
&lrm;Ah! Your nonna has also brought you
&lrm;your favourite candy!

04:49.400 --> 04:51.280
&lrm;Oh! [nervous laugh]

04:51.400 --> 04:54.360
&lrm;-You still love them, right?
&lrm;-Yes, yes, of course!

04:54.480 --> 04:58.680
&lrm;And that's not all, my fairy!
&lrm;We'll have a wonderful day, you and I,

04:58.800 --> 05:01.560
&lrm;just like the last time!
&lrm;We'll go to the merry-go-round,

05:01.680 --> 05:05.960
&lrm;-then to the zoo, then...
&lrm;-Uh... Mom? Can I have a word, Mom?

05:06.080 --> 05:07.920
&lrm;-Just the two of us?
&lrm;-What, Tom?

05:08.040 --> 05:11.120
&lrm;That I don't know Marinetta
&lrm;any more 'cause I'm always away?

05:11.240 --> 05:12.960
&lrm;No, Mom, it's just...

05:13.080 --> 05:16.320
&lrm;You think she doesn't want to spend time
&lrm;with her nonna, is that it?

05:16.440 --> 05:19.040
&lrm;No! Of course
&lrm;I want to spend time with you!

05:19.160 --> 05:22.520
&lrm;-Besides, it's not four o'clock yet!
&lrm;-There. You see?

05:23.040 --> 05:25.840
&lrm;Come on, let's go, Marinetta!
&lrm;We're going to have a ball!

05:59.760 --> 06:02.120
&lrm;It's four o'clock. Maybe you were right.

06:02.240 --> 06:05.600
&lrm;I jumped to conclusions
&lrm;and there really is no surprise party.

06:05.720 --> 06:08.840
&lrm;Why don't you tell your grandmother
&lrm;you don't like this candy?

06:08.960 --> 06:11.680
&lrm;Not to hurt her feelings.
&lrm;We don't see each other often.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.200
&lrm;-[phone rings]
&lrm;-Aaah! Alya!

06:15.320 --> 06:18.080
&lrm;Sorry, I'm running late.
&lrm;Can you meet me at the park?

06:18.200 --> 06:21.240
&lrm;We'll jam straight from there
&lrm;to the... uh... dentist!

06:21.360 --> 06:26.800
&lrm;Yes... yes, awesome! "To the dentist".
&lrm;Totally! I'll be right there!

06:29.840 --> 06:34.040
&lrm;Oh! I'm so sorry, Grandma.
&lrm;I have to go to the dentist with Alya.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.080
&lrm;Surely you're not going to the dentist
&lrm;on your birthday?

06:37.200 --> 06:40.240
&lrm;I still have to take you to see
&lrm;the trains at the station!

06:40.360 --> 06:43.080
&lrm;Well, it's because Alya
&lrm;has sisters who are twins and

06:43.200 --> 06:45.720
&lrm;as there are two of them,
&lrm;Alya needs my help and...

06:45.840 --> 06:49.280
&lrm;Wait. What am I saying?
&lrm;That's all a fake out!

06:49.400 --> 06:53.240
&lrm;You know what I think? Alya might
&lrm;be throwing me a surprise birthday party.

06:53.360 --> 06:58.720
&lrm;I get it, my fairy! Don't worry about me.
&lrm;Run along, now, and go meet your friend!

06:58.840 --> 07:01.840
&lrm;-Are you sure?
&lrm;-Go on. I'll hold on to all this.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.280
&lrm;-We'll catch up later.
&lrm;-Thank you!

07:04.400 --> 07:07.400
&lrm;You really&lrm;<i> are</i>
&lrm;the best grandma in the world!

07:09.760 --> 07:13.800
&lrm;Tom! That's the motorcycle. They're
&lrm;coming back! Marinette can't see the cake!

07:15.680 --> 07:18.160
&lrm;-Uh... Where's Marinette?
&lrm;-Tom was right.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.880
&lrm;She's too old now
&lrm;to spend time with her nonna.

07:21.480 --> 07:24.480
&lrm;What? No, no, Tom never said that!

07:24.600 --> 07:28.200
&lrm;That's sweet of you, Sabine,
&lrm;but it's not a big deal. That's life!

07:28.320 --> 07:30.800
&lrm;I'll be up in the apartment
&lrm;if you need me.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.840
&lrm;You should go and speak to your mother.
&lrm;She's... Oh, no!

07:35.960 --> 07:38.280
&lrm;I know!
&lrm;And it's almost time for the party!

07:38.400 --> 07:42.040
&lrm;OK. I'll help you. We can manage!
&lrm;And we'll take Gina to the party with us.

08:13.800 --> 08:18.160
&lrm;What could be more powerful than
&lrm;a grandmother who has been deserted?

08:18.280 --> 08:22.400
&lrm;Perfect fodder for disappointment
&lrm;and misunderstanding.

08:28.960 --> 08:33.400
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,
&lrm;and evilise her ailing heart!

08:41.919 --> 08:44.760
&lrm;Befana, I am Hawk Moth.

08:44.880 --> 08:48.040
&lrm;I'm restoring
&lrm;your matriarchal power as grandmother!

08:48.160 --> 08:53.480
&lrm;You will use these candies to reward
&lrm;the deserving and punish the ungrateful!

08:53.600 --> 08:56.680
&lrm;As for my reward,
&lrm;you will bring me the Miraculous

08:56.800 --> 09:00.480
&lrm;of those pesky little kids,
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir!

09:00.600 --> 09:05.120
&lrm;You're right, Hawk Moth. The time
&lrm;has come to teach them all a lesson!

09:11.320 --> 09:13.040
&lrm;-Ta-dah!
&lrm;-Ah!

09:13.160 --> 09:16.560
&lrm;Good job, partner! We better get going!
&lrm;The party awaits us!

09:17.280 --> 09:19.080
&lrm;Oh, wait! We've got to tell Mom.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.840
&lrm;Naughty son!
&lrm;Don't tell your mamma what to do!

09:23.960 --> 09:25.040
&lrm;Mom?

09:27.200 --> 09:28.840
&lrm;[evil laugh]

09:28.960 --> 09:32.640
&lrm;Do you know what naughty boys is get?

09:34.520 --> 09:36.120
&lrm;Coal!

09:36.240 --> 09:40.080
&lrm;You have nothing to fear, my fairy.
&lrm;You've always been good to me.

09:43.920 --> 09:47.280
&lrm;So now, tell me. Marinette
&lrm;isn't at the dentist, is she?

09:47.400 --> 09:50.680
&lrm;-No, Mistress.
&lrm;-Then take me to her.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.440
&lrm;Happy Birthday, Marinette!

09:59.760 --> 10:00.800
&lrm;Open it, Marinette!

10:01.600 --> 10:05.760
&lrm;♪ La Befana comes at night

&lrm;-Grandma?
&lrm;-You lied to your grandma, Marinetta.

10:13.920 --> 10:17.480
&lrm;No, I... I didn't know Alya
&lrm;was throwing a surprise party for me.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.880
&lrm;-She's for real, ma'am.
&lrm;-And all those candies

10:20.000 --> 10:21.600
&lrm;you pretended to be eating?

10:21.720 --> 10:24.760
&lrm;I'm sorry, Grandma. It's just that
&lrm;I didn't want to upset you.

10:24.880 --> 10:29.360
&lrm;I'm not your grandma any more.
&lrm;From now on, I am only Befana

10:29.480 --> 10:32.320
&lrm;and I'm going to punish you
&lrm;for all those lies!

10:34.720 --> 10:36.240
&lrm;No!

10:36.960 --> 10:38.920
&lrm;We didn't even get in on the buffet!

10:39.040 --> 10:42.040
&lrm;The party's over, my friend!
&lrm;Plagg... claws out!

10:58.600 --> 11:02.240
&lrm;It's rude to leave
&lrm;while Befana's still speaking to you!

11:02.360 --> 11:05.240
&lrm;Hey! I never knew
&lrm;grandmas could be so nasty!

11:05.360 --> 11:07.960
&lrm;You'll look wonderful in white,
&lrm;my pretty kitty!

11:09.200 --> 11:13.400
&lrm;Not convinced. I'm much more into black.
&lrm;Makes my eyes stand out, don't you think?

11:18.720 --> 11:21.680
&lrm;Take care of this pesky pussycat!

11:23.680 --> 11:26.160
&lrm;Hey! I thought fairies
&lrm;were supposed to be nice!

11:27.120 --> 11:30.200
&lrm;You're not getting away unpunished,
&lrm;Marinetta!

11:32.520 --> 11:35.560
&lrm;You don't deserve all these presents,
&lrm;you spoiled brat!

11:35.680 --> 11:38.080
&lrm;Now for what you really deserve...

11:41.640 --> 11:44.400
&lrm;Don't worry.
&lrm;You'll get what's coming to you!

11:45.240 --> 11:47.800
&lrm;This isn't how I envisioned
&lrm;my birthday party!

11:47.920 --> 11:49.640
&lrm;You need to transform!

11:50.600 --> 11:53.800
&lrm;-Do you lie only to me?
&lrm;-Cat Noir!

11:53.920 --> 11:55.520
&lrm;Stay put. I'll be right there!

11:55.640 --> 11:56.840
&lrm;Uh... Soon!

11:57.280 --> 12:00.600
&lrm;Or do you also lie to your parents,
&lrm;and your friends, too?

12:02.720 --> 12:04.520
&lrm;-We gotta help Marinette!
&lrm;-Yeah.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.160
&lrm;The time has come to teach you a lesson!

12:08.120 --> 12:12.480
&lrm;-Marinette is not a liar!
&lrm;-Someone has to teach you table manners.

12:16.520 --> 12:17.760
&lrm;Alya!

12:21.840 --> 12:22.840
&lrm;No, Kim!

12:22.960 --> 12:27.440
&lrm;That's what you get for stealing candy,
&lrm;you bunch of ill-mannered kids!

12:27.560 --> 12:31.040
&lrm;Don't touch Marinette! She's only
&lrm;the nicest person in the world!

12:31.160 --> 12:34.400
&lrm;Hmm. It's very disrespectful
&lrm;to speak up without permission.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.640
&lrm;But it's quite noble of you
&lrm;to stick up for your friends.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.840
&lrm;OK, I shall make you... a fairy!

12:42.600 --> 12:47.360
&lrm;You are going to help me
&lrm;discipline your friend! Ha, ha, ha!

12:47.480 --> 12:50.280
&lrm;Tikki...

12:50.400 --> 12:53.960
&lrm;Sorry I kept you waiting.
&lrm;We need to find you a better hiding place.

12:55.680 --> 12:58.960
&lrm;Marinetta's getting away with the kitty!
&lrm;Catch them!

12:59.920 --> 13:01.840
&lrm;Marinette is cool, so don't touch her!

13:01.960 --> 13:05.960
&lrm;-We won't let you hurt Marinette!
&lrm;-Is that how you speak to your elders?

13:06.080 --> 13:07.840
&lrm;How rude!

13:09.800 --> 13:12.320
&lrm;Maybe this way,
&lrm;you'll learn to keep quiet.

13:13.600 --> 13:17.040
&lrm;You must be real cool if all your friends
&lrm;are protecting you like that!

13:17.160 --> 13:20.880
&lrm;-Why's your grandma flipping out?
&lrm;-She wanted me around more.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.200
&lrm;Don't worry.
&lrm;I'll get your real grandma back.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.920
&lrm;Oh, I almost forgot.
&lrm;Happy Birthday, anyway.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.440
&lrm;Thank you, Cat Noir.

13:34.960 --> 13:38.920
&lrm;It's time to save my nonna!
&lrm;Tikki! Spots on!

13:39.040 --> 13:40.560
&lrm;Ha!

&lrm;Bring me the Miraculous, Befana!

14:28.280 --> 14:30.760
&lrm;You didn't say the magic word.

14:30.880 --> 14:31.880
&lrm;Ahem.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.160
&lrm;-Please.
&lrm;-Much better, Hawk Moth!

14:35.280 --> 14:37.800
&lrm;You little thief!
&lrm;Where have you hidden Marinetta?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.320
&lrm;I forgetta!

14:39.440 --> 14:41.400
&lrm;Watch out or you'll get a time-out!

14:41.520 --> 14:43.240
&lrm;Take care of these two villains!

14:46.400 --> 14:50.360
&lrm;What does the villainous cat burglar
&lrm;do when he feels threatened?

14:51.600 --> 14:53.000
&lrm;He climbs!

&lrm;-We can't let her get to the Eiffel Tower!
&lrm;-And why not?

15:03.360 --> 15:05.720
&lrm;Because that's where I hid
&lrm;her granddaughter!

15:05.840 --> 15:07.520
&lrm;Wait. No! She's...

15:11.880 --> 15:16.360
&lrm;Where are you, Marinetta?
&lrm;Befana has a special treat for you!

15:16.840 --> 15:20.520
&lrm;Can I hitch a ride? Your granddaughter
&lrm;isn't here. Let me show you the way.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.280
&lrm;Pets are not allowed on board.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.560
&lrm;Aaah!

15:27.600 --> 15:32.000
&lrm;What a sweet little ladybug you are!
&lrm;You'd make a perfect fairy!

15:36.520 --> 15:39.520
&lrm;-Thanks, but no thanks!
&lrm;-You can't turn down a gift,

15:39.640 --> 15:40.840
&lrm;you rude little imp!

15:40.960 --> 15:45.120
&lrm;You take care of the kitty, my fairies,
&lrm;while I punish this polka-dot brat!

16:02.160 --> 16:03.120
&lrm;[evil laugh]

16:25.960 --> 16:30.400
&lrm;Cat Noir, I saw Befana dodging her own
&lrm;candies. Even she can't touch them!

16:31.080 --> 16:33.120
&lrm;The candy bag! The akuma must be in there.

16:33.240 --> 16:34.920
&lrm;Of course!

16:35.040 --> 16:36.720
&lrm;Lucky charm!

16:41.960 --> 16:45.760
&lrm;-You didn't tell me you played the tuba!
&lrm;-I don't! But I'll have to learn!

16:50.440 --> 16:51.480
&lrm;Aaah!

16:53.200 --> 16:57.720
&lrm;You've been very naughty. I'm going to
&lrm;have to take your toys away from you!

17:02.120 --> 17:04.040
&lrm;OK, you win, Befana.

17:05.920 --> 17:09.319
&lrm;I did lie. I'm sorry.
&lrm;Your granddaughter is here.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.000
&lrm;Never too late to tell the truth, right?

17:12.119 --> 17:15.119
&lrm;-I don't believe you!
&lrm;-I'll take you to her myself.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.240
&lrm;Keep an eye on the ladybug!

17:24.160 --> 17:26.560
&lrm;Sorry, guys,
&lrm;I've got to put you all in time-out.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.120
&lrm;-Phew!
&lrm;-What is the meaning of this?

17:33.240 --> 17:35.640
&lrm;-She isn't here!
&lrm;-I guess I'm a compulsive liar.

17:39.680 --> 17:43.840
&lrm;There you are! Nice try, Marinetta!
&lrm;But she won't get away that easily!

17:43.960 --> 17:45.880
&lrm;[evil laugh]

17:48.440 --> 17:50.600
&lrm;Don't worry, Cat Noir. Marinette is safe.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.520
&lrm;I'm waiting for you, Marinetta!

18:01.000 --> 18:02.240
&lrm;What?

18:03.960 --> 18:06.000
&lrm;Cat Noir, the fire hydrant!

18:07.360 --> 18:10.640
&lrm;My pleasure! Cataclysm!

&lrm;No!

&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

18:41.600 --> 18:43.720
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

18:47.200 --> 18:48.120
&lrm;Gotcha!

18:49.720 --> 18:51.600
&lrm;Bye, little butterfly!

18:51.720 --> 18:54.160
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

19:05.120 --> 19:06.080
&lrm;Pound it!

19:06.680 --> 19:10.600
&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir,
&lrm;you've escaped punishment yet again!

19:10.720 --> 19:12.480
&lrm;I won't sugar-coat the truth.

19:12.600 --> 19:16.520
&lrm;The next time, I&lrm;<i> will</i>&lrm; destroy you
&lrm;and have your Miraculous!

19:18.160 --> 19:19.880
&lrm;So, how about you, André?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.360
&lrm;Do you have anyone in particular
&lrm;to share your ice cream with?

19:23.480 --> 19:26.800
&lrm;Well, actually, I have yet to find
&lrm;the perfect blend of flavours.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.640
&lrm;-Grandma!
&lrm;-My sweetie!

19:29.760 --> 19:31.560
&lrm;What did you do with that T-shirt?

19:31.680 --> 19:35.280
&lrm;I fixed it up. I've been sewing
&lrm;since the last time you came to visit.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.560
&lrm;You're so grown up, Marinette.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.800
&lrm;You know what? There'll be
&lrm;no more merry-go-rounds or zoos.

19:40.920 --> 19:44.280
&lrm;For your next birthday,
&lrm;I'll take you on one of my trips!

19:44.400 --> 19:48.280
&lrm;Thank you, Grandma! But, you know,
&lrm;it doesn't matter where you take me.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.800

&lrm;Brava!

20:05.080 --> 20:09.080
&lrm;You never got a chance to open it,
&lrm;with all that was going on!

20:09.200 --> 20:10.600
&lrm;Oh!

20:11.320 --> 20:15.280
&lrm;I always carry the lucky charm
&lrm;you gave me, and it works pretty well.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.680
&lrm;So, I figured it was my turn
&lrm;to make one for you.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.880
&lrm;You're so wonderful.
&lrm;Oh! It's wonderful! What a charm!

20:23.000 --> 20:25.200
&lrm;Uh... the charm!
&lrm;I mean, I'll wear the charm!

20:25.320 --> 20:28.480
&lrm;With luck... uh...
&lrm;Basically, uh... Thank you?

20:29.520 --> 20:31.360
&lrm;Aw!

20:35.920 --> 20:42.320
&lrm;Do you realise? He made it specially
&lrm;for me... with his own hands... Adrien!

20:42.920 --> 20:46.480
&lrm;Yeah, well, it's kind of a weird gift,
&lrm;if you ask me.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.320
&lrm;No weirder than yours, Tikki!

20:51.640 --> 20:54.600
&lrm;But that doesn't mean
&lrm;they're not both precious to me.

20:54.720 --> 20:58.240
&lrm;-So, you really did like the gift, then?
&lrm;-Of course I did!

20:58.360 --> 21:03.080
&lrm;The most important thing about a present,
&lrm;Tikki, is the person who's giving it.
