<i>I'm not sick, but I'm not well</i>

00:05.887 --> 00:09.323
<i>And I'm so hot</i>

00:09.367 --> 00:13.883
<i>Cos I'm in hell</i>

00:18.647 --> 00:20.797
'The remains of an old lady's life.

00:20.847 --> 00:22.724
'What a paltry set of mementos!

00:22.767 --> 00:26.123
'I don't want to lord it over
Jez's dead great-aunt,

interesting set of personal effects.

00:37.007 --> 00:39.760
Managing to contain
your grief, Jeremy?

00:39.807 --> 00:43.402
Come on, she was my mum's aunt.
I only met her about twice.

00:43.447 --> 00:45.199
It's not like she was Ian Curtis.

00:45.247 --> 00:47.238
She was never going to make
a seminal album.

00:47.287 --> 00:48.606
She couldn't even make Christmas cake.

00:48.647 --> 00:52.879
It's a pisser though, isn't it? Cancer.
They should find a fucking cure.

00:52.927 --> 00:55.077
- I think they're trying.
- Yeah, sure they are.

00:55.127 --> 00:57.766
They should pull their fucking
fingers out. It's important, Mark.

01:00.127 --> 01:03.483
Not a huge reader. Three James Herriots,

01:03.527 --> 01:04.926
Frank Muir's autobiography

01:04.967 --> 01:09.085
and the Reader's Digest
Quiz and Puzzle Book 1984.

01:09.127 --> 01:12.164
Mum's getting 40 grand in the will

01:12.207 --> 01:15.279
and she's promised me half.
It's all gravy from here, Mark.

01:15.327 --> 01:19.366
Good old Gwen. I couldn't have planned
this better if I'd murdered her myself.

01:19.407 --> 01:21.602
£20,000 won't last forever, Jeremy.

01:21.647 --> 01:26.118
What do you mean?
£20,000- I'm going to be a millionaire!

01:26.167 --> 01:30.638
"I have a mouth, but do not speak,
I have a bed but never sleep. "

01:30.687 --> 01:31.915
What am I?

01:31.967 --> 01:33.161
A river.

01:33.207 --> 01:35.118
Nicholas Lyndhurst.

01:35.167 --> 01:38.000
- That's the wrong-answer section.
- Fuck this shit.

01:38.047 --> 01:39.400
So when's the funeral?

01:39.447 --> 01:42.405
Wednesday. But Mum's
coming over this afternoon,

01:42.447 --> 01:45.166
which will be incredibly boring.

01:45.207 --> 01:48.756
You should drop acid at the funeral.
Make it more intense. That's what I did

01:48.807 --> 01:52.243
<i>at me old man's. It was fucking mental.
I was crying and laughing.</i>

01:52.287 --> 01:54.676
Didn't know who was dead
and who was alive.

01:54.727 --> 01:55.876
Shit.

01:55.927 --> 01:57.246
What, dildo?

01:59.207 --> 02:00.276
Jesus, Jeremy!

02:00.327 --> 02:03.000
Wow! Nice. Nice gun.

02:03.047 --> 02:06.278
Must be, what... a war gun?

02:06.327 --> 02:08.636
Yeah. I reckon it's a war gun.

02:08.687 --> 02:12.316
This is great. This isn't bin or sell,
this is a keeper!

02:12.367 --> 02:14.198
You're not serious,
it's an illegal firearm!

02:14.247 --> 02:17.796
It's not illegal... probably.
It's just a grisly souvenir.

02:17.847 --> 02:21.635
- You've got to get rid of it, Jeremy.
- Where should he take it, Mark? Scope?

02:21.687 --> 02:25.680
Leave it in a litter bin for a kiddie to
find and kill his mum? You'd love that!

02:25.727 --> 02:26.716
No.

02:26.767 --> 02:30.237
I'll keep it in my room. It'll be safe
there. I'll put it in a drawer.

02:30.287 --> 02:34.439
Oh, brilliant As long as no-one can
work out the intricate sliding mechanism

02:34.487 --> 02:37.081
that opens your drawer,
it'll be perfectly safe!

02:37.127 --> 02:41.439
'Yeah, sure, you've got sarcasm.
I've got a big gun! '

02:43.087 --> 02:46.318
'Good old Jeremy's mum.
The more sophisticated end

02:46.367 --> 02:52.044
'of the mum spectrum, the sort of
mum you'd buy in John Lewis. '

02:52.087 --> 02:54.476
Mummy! Coffee!

02:54.527 --> 02:56.995
Fucky hurry-uppy!

02:57.047 --> 03:00.517
'Whereas he's the sort of son
you'd get free with Nuts magazine. '

03:00.567 --> 03:03.479
Did you bring those
CDs like I told you?

03:03.527 --> 03:05.358
Yes, they're in my handbag.
Shall I fetch them?

03:05.407 --> 03:09.400
Might be an idea.
Oh, and guess what?

03:09.447 --> 03:12.723
- You forgot to top up my mobile again.
- Sorry, Jez,

03:12.767 --> 03:16.396
is there some reason why you're being
so incredibly rude to your mum?

03:16.447 --> 03:18.244
Oh, right, stick up for Mummy.

03:18.287 --> 03:20.403
You don't know her, Mark,
you don't know her tricks.

03:20.447 --> 03:24.076
Anyway, what's it to you?
Do you want to fuck my mum, is that it?

03:24.127 --> 03:25.799
Mum, Mark wants to fuck you!

03:25.847 --> 03:27.565
Shut up, Jeremy!

03:27.607 --> 03:29.757
He definitely wants
to fuck you, Mum!

03:29.807 --> 03:32.002
Stop showing off to Mark, Jeremy. 

03:32.047 --> 03:34.845
Me? I'm not the one
dressed like a prossie.

03:34.887 --> 03:37.765
Please, Jez, this level
of conflict may be usual for you,

03:37.807 --> 03:40.640
but it's not healthy.
I'm going to have a heart attack.

03:40.687 --> 03:43.997
And I suppose your relationship
with your mum is healthy, is it?

03:44.047 --> 03:45.446
Sitting in silence, watching Taggart.

03:45.487 --> 03:48.559
30 years of mutual resentment
eating away at you.

03:48.607 --> 03:50.916
We like Taggart.
Even the new ones.

03:52.847 --> 03:55.122
- Right...
- Where are those clothes I asked for?

03:55.167 --> 03:57.442
Martin's bringing them
when he picks me up.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.081
- Here we are.
- Who's Martin?

04:00.127 --> 04:02.322
Oh, God, not another boyfriend!

04:02.367 --> 04:04.722
Fucking hell, Mum!
How many's that now?

04:04.767 --> 04:06.997
'How come she gets
all the bloody boyfriends? '

04:07.047 --> 04:09.959
'OK, so he's ex-Army,
but keep calm. '

04:10.007 --> 04:11.565
- Martin.
- Hello, love.

04:11.607 --> 04:14.758
'Shit, it's Paddy Ashdown,
it's Indiana Jones!

04:14.807 --> 04:17.480
'Lndiana Ashdown! '
Pleased to meet you, Martin, I'm Mark.

04:17.527 --> 04:18.846
You're not the son?

04:18.887 --> 04:21.003
No, that's the son.

04:21.047 --> 04:24.642
Hi. Are you my new daddy?

04:24.687 --> 04:28.157
Natalie's bringing up
that bag of clothes you asked for.

04:28.207 --> 04:31.279
'The daughter. I wonder what she's like.
Maybe she's "the one. "'

04:31.327 --> 04:33.079
Do you need a hand?

04:33.127 --> 04:35.595
No, fine. Will you give that to my dad?

04:35.647 --> 04:37.956
Sure. Would you like
to come in for coffee?

04:38.007 --> 04:39.759
No, fine.

04:40.607 --> 04:44.646
'Well, if she is the one,
she's hiding it brilliantly. '

04:46.047 --> 04:51.041
So, Martin, Jackie tells me
you're a Scots Guardsman.

04:51.087 --> 04:52.805
Did you see a lot of action?

04:52.847 --> 04:56.237
' That was a good question,
better than "Can I get you a coffee?"'

04:56.287 --> 04:57.766
...Malaysia, not pretty.

04:57.807 --> 04:59.763
Falklands, ditto.

04:59.807 --> 05:02.275
- Did you kill many black babies?
- In the Falklands?

05:02.327 --> 05:04.795
I'll get you a coffee.

05:04.847 --> 05:07.441
I've got some more
Corfu property details.

05:07.487 --> 05:10.365
I think we'll be able to see them all
while we're there.

05:10.407 --> 05:12.477
Are you buying somewhere?
I hope this isn't coming out of

05:12.527 --> 05:14.040
my chunk of the dead Gwen bonanza.

05:14.087 --> 05:17.238
Actually, darling, if you remember,
we spoke about...

05:17.287 --> 05:18.356
Spoke about what?

05:18.407 --> 05:23.800
Just that it might not be ideal
for you still to be living on

05:23.847 --> 05:25.803
handouts from your mother.
You're what, 35?

05:25.847 --> 05:28.759
- Fuck off!
- Jackie isn't a wealthy woman, Jeremy.

05:28.807 --> 05:34.086
Mum? You said I could have half of
Gwen's money. That's what you said.

05:34.127 --> 05:35.685
To me. Your son.

05:35.727 --> 05:38.400
Don't hassle me.
You know I don't like being hassled.

05:38.447 --> 05:41.883
Little Henry Hassle,
that's what I used to call him!

05:44.847 --> 05:48.681
What are we going to do with him,
Mark?

05:48.727 --> 05:52.436
Thank goodness he lives with you,
sweetheart. You're very good for him.

05:52.487 --> 05:53.806
I try.

05:53.847 --> 05:57.157
'Parents do tend to like me.
Apart from Dad, obviously. '

05:57.207 --> 05:59.641
Maybe you should try and talk to him.

05:59.687 --> 06:02.485
I won't get through.

06:02.527 --> 06:05.724
'The woman has left,
let the war talk commence. '

06:05.767 --> 06:08.486
So, Martin, are you
a military history buff

06:08.527 --> 06:12.236
or is that too much of
a busman's holiday for you?

06:12.287 --> 06:16.200
Bit like a butcher looking at...
meat catalogues.

06:16.247 --> 06:19.125
'Meat catalogues don't exist,
Mark, get a grip! '

06:19.167 --> 06:22.523
- I'm very keen on military history.
- I've got all the Antony Beevors.

06:22.567 --> 06:27.004
Don't you find him? I find Beevor
a bit lightweight, if I'm honest.

06:27.047 --> 06:28.765
Yeah, he's rubbish, isn't he?

06:28.807 --> 06:30.684
'I'm so sorry, Anthony. '

06:30.727 --> 06:32.240
He's fine for an overview.

06:32.287 --> 06:36.838
That's all I read him for, really.
I get the detail elsewhere.

06:36.887 --> 06:41.324
You're really into this stuff,
aren't you? Do you write at all?

06:41.367 --> 06:45.155
I did once start a business book.
I've always fancied doing an article

06:45.207 --> 06:48.404
about the evacuation of Greece
in '41 for the local paper.

06:48.447 --> 06:52.486
Not that it would really fit in
among the kebab-shop stabbings.

06:52.527 --> 06:55.599
'Why doesn't Jeremy want you
to be his dad?

06:55.647 --> 06:58.878
'I want you to be my dad.
I want to sit on your knee right now. '

07:01.407 --> 07:03.238
'Right, everyone's out.

07:03.287 --> 07:05.562
'Might sneak a little peek at the gun.

07:05.607 --> 07:08.246
'Lt's fine to be fascinated by the gun.

07:08.287 --> 07:12.280
'Lt's fascinating. Everything that
can kill a man is fascinating.

07:12.327 --> 07:16.764
'Guns, electric chairs, paracetamol,
lead piping. '

07:16.807 --> 07:18.877
Hello, Mark.

07:18.927 --> 07:21.316
Oh... hi, Jez.

07:21.367 --> 07:23.198
I was just... you know,

07:23.247 --> 07:27.286
making sure it was safe.
Gunny, the gun.

07:27.327 --> 07:28.601
You like it, Mark.

07:28.647 --> 07:30.877
That's fine. You like the gun.

07:30.927 --> 07:36.718
Guns are great. Design classics, like
the Routemaster Bus or those chairs.

07:36.767 --> 07:38.917
It's fine to like it as an object,
isn't it?

07:38.967 --> 07:43.165
I might carry it around the flat
for a bit. Would that be OK?

07:43.207 --> 07:45.323
Sure, man. Enjoy.

07:45.367 --> 07:47.642
'Oh, this is good.

07:47.687 --> 07:49.166
'This feels so good. '

07:49.207 --> 07:50.435
Jackie called earlier.

07:50.487 --> 07:53.047
Was it about my money?
- I'm afraid not.

07:53.087 --> 07:55.681
She invited me to have dinner
with her and Martin.

07:55.727 --> 07:58.605
Why? Maybe they both want to fuck you.

07:58.647 --> 07:59.682
Stop it, Jeremy.

07:59.727 --> 08:04.164
'Although what do they want? What
will I talk to the grown-ups about? '

08:04.207 --> 08:06.880
- Give us a go with Gunny.
- Um...

08:06.927 --> 08:09.202
Come on, my turn with Gunny!

08:09.247 --> 08:12.717
Now pass me the Doritos
or I'll blow my brains out!

08:12.767 --> 08:17.238
'Maybe they're going to blame me
for Jeremy. I should have done more. '

08:17.287 --> 08:19.721
Perhaps I won't go. Might be awkward.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.519
No, no, bat for me, talk me up.

08:21.567 --> 08:25.321
For you as much as me.
I owe you over £1,000.

08:25.367 --> 08:28.916
- £4,000.
- Exactly. Over £1,000.

08:30.727 --> 08:33.400
And then there's fixed rate
versus variable.

08:33.447 --> 08:36.086
You're right, Martin,
it is a financial minefield.

08:36.126 --> 08:37.559
Oh, absolutely.

08:37.607 --> 08:40.644
'This is great!
Why was I anxious? I'm in my element.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.563
'Older people are still people.

08:42.607 --> 08:45.280
'Just people who think when they open
a new window on the computer

08:45.327 --> 08:47.887
'the previous window
disappears for good. '

08:47.927 --> 08:50.839
Jonathan Dimbleby was talking
about offset mortgages

08:50.887 --> 08:53.481
on some Radio 4 programme yesterday.

08:53.527 --> 08:57.725
I always think there's a third Dimbleby
brother they keep locked in an attic.

08:59.287 --> 09:00.276
Gummo Dimbleby!

09:00.327 --> 09:03.046
'Yes! No-one else I know
would have found that funny

09:03.087 --> 09:05.123
'but I was right
to think it was amusing. '

09:05.167 --> 09:09.877
You're a very witty chap, Mark. Which is
sort of the reason I asked you tonight.

09:09.927 --> 09:12.282
I want to...
'Fuck you. '

09:12.327 --> 09:15.239
...look into writing a memoir
about my time in the Scots.

09:15.287 --> 09:17.517
A small publisher's interested,

09:17.567 --> 09:21.446
I'm looking at possible collaborators.
Would you be interested?

09:21.487 --> 09:24.047
'I would literally stab a baby
to do it. '

09:24.087 --> 09:25.805
Yes, Martin, I think I would.

09:25.847 --> 09:29.920
Good. Well, we must keep chatting
before Jackie and I jet off to Corfu.

09:29.967 --> 09:31.446
Great.

09:31.487 --> 09:35.685
Now, can we talk about Jeremy
and this whole inheritance situation?

09:35.727 --> 09:39.163
I don't know what to do, Mark.
Would the money be good for Jeremy?

09:39.207 --> 09:42.483
- Good for Jeremy?
- Yes.

09:42.527 --> 09:44.404
Would it be good for him?

09:44.447 --> 09:45.926
What an interesting question.

09:45.967 --> 09:49.596
'Which way will Caesar Corrigan's
thumb point?

09:49.647 --> 09:52.115
'This is a fantastic evening.
I've become

09:52.167 --> 09:55.682
'a military historian, and Jeremy's
future happiness rests in my hands.

09:55.727 --> 09:58.116
'And I've got a Tiramisu.

09:58.167 --> 09:59.839
'This is fucking amazing! '

10:01.367 --> 10:05.440
Well? Did you do it?
Have I got my money?

10:05.487 --> 10:09.241
Don't do the pause, Mark, you're
not Davina! Have I got my money?

10:09.287 --> 10:10.879
Yes, you've got your money.

10:10.927 --> 10:12.645
Yes! Mwah!

10:12.687 --> 10:16.726
You beautiful man. I'm gonna tattoo
your name on my balls.

10:16.767 --> 10:18.200
I'm a millionaire again!

10:18.247 --> 10:19.396
But there's a condition.

10:19.447 --> 10:21.483
There's always conditions, Mark.
You can ignore conditions.

10:21.527 --> 10:24.678
When you sign up for a credit card
or adopted child there are conditions,

10:24.727 --> 10:25.842
they're meaningless.

10:25.887 --> 10:28.606
Jackie doesn't trust you
with that kind of money.

10:28.647 --> 10:31.081
She wants to put someone
in charge of it

10:31.127 --> 10:34.483
- to control how much you spend.
- Fuck, it's not Martin, is it?

10:34.527 --> 10:36.802
No... No, it's not, actually.

10:36.847 --> 10:41.318
Right, who is it? Is it some kind of
Brewster's Millions scenario?

10:43.327 --> 10:44.760
It's me.

10:44.807 --> 10:47.162
I'm in charge of your money.

10:47.207 --> 10:50.961
Brilliant You're the boss of me.

10:51.007 --> 10:54.079
This is your pathetic dream
come true, isn't it?

10:54.127 --> 10:57.403
No, it isn't. 'Yes, it is.
I've got your balls in a vice.

10:57.447 --> 11:00.166
'I'm the iron chancellor! '

11:00.207 --> 11:04.041
I've worked out a budget.
I think £70 a week is about right.

11:04.087 --> 11:07.636
And I'll take £130 for rent
and loan repayments.

11:07.687 --> 11:11.362
Basically, you're my dad now
and you give me my pocket money?

11:11.407 --> 11:13.204
You don't have to agree, Jeremy.

11:13.247 --> 11:15.602
You're free to turn the money down.

11:15.647 --> 11:17.842
'That would teach him
if I did turn it down.

11:17.887 --> 11:20.196
'That would wipe the shit-eating grin
off his face if I did that. '

11:20.247 --> 11:21.282
Do you agree?

11:21.327 --> 11:23.795
Of course I agree,
obviously I agree.

11:26.407 --> 11:27.806
Can I have some money for expenses,

11:27.847 --> 11:29.838
- on credit?
- To spend on what?

11:29.887 --> 11:33.596
You're at your great-aunt's wake, Jez,
all the food and drink is free

11:33.647 --> 11:37.242
and I don't think there's going
to be a tombola or a bouncy castle.

11:37.287 --> 11:39.198
'I'll shoot the breeze with Super Hans.

11:39.247 --> 11:43.923
'Chatting with your mates is still free.
You can't tax that, Brown! '

11:43.967 --> 11:48.358
- You all right?
- Jez, can you tell me, as a mate,

11:48.407 --> 11:53.925
someone who knows me really well,
is the bottom half of me on fire?

11:53.967 --> 11:55.798
No.

11:55.847 --> 11:58.964
- Thanks. That's good.
- Are you tripping?

11:59.007 --> 12:01.043
The shit I'm seeing,
I fucking well hope so!

12:01.087 --> 12:03.760
You couldn't get me any glue,
could you? Take the edge off?

12:03.807 --> 12:05.035
- Glue?
- Yeah.

12:05.087 --> 12:07.681
Glue's coming back. Nature's glue.

12:07.727 --> 12:12.642
'I've never done glue. Never boffed
a tranny. I've hardly lived. '

12:12.687 --> 12:16.680
I've had a few thoughts about the title.
Warrior King?

12:16.727 --> 12:19.366
Or Master Of Men?

12:19.407 --> 12:20.601
War Dad?

12:20.647 --> 12:22.478
I'll run them past Natalie.

12:22.527 --> 12:25.997
I'm using her as a bit of
a younger-generation sounding board.

12:26.047 --> 12:30.837
Look, Mark, I'm actually seeing
one other guy tomorrow

12:30.887 --> 12:34.562
about the writing.
Best hold fire for a day or so.

12:34.607 --> 12:35.960
'Fuck, a rival! '

12:36.007 --> 12:38.760
He's very good, Brendan. Ex-Navy.

12:38.807 --> 12:40.763
'A rival who dippy Jackie likes. '

12:40.807 --> 12:42.206
Right.

12:42.247 --> 12:45.045
'OK, need to smarm the sounding board. '

12:45.087 --> 12:47.237
Hello, again, is this?

12:47.287 --> 12:50.404
Yeah, Dad asked me to do the food.
I'm in the catering corps.

12:50.447 --> 12:53.598
So, are you the ghost writer?

12:53.647 --> 12:55.399
Well, hopefully.

12:55.447 --> 12:56.641
'Ls she straight?

12:56.687 --> 13:01.761
'Gay? Doesn't bother me, it's just nice
to know. It's not like I'm a homophobe,

13:01.807 --> 13:05.880
'but it's good to know where you are.
Stay safe, praise the food,

13:05.927 --> 13:07.565
'the lukewarm disgusting food. '

13:07.607 --> 13:10.644
- This food is superb.
- Thanks.

13:10.687 --> 13:13.645
Normal slop, tarted up
like a whore's drawers.

13:13.687 --> 13:17.157
Actually, Natalie,
could I interview you about your dad?

13:17.207 --> 13:19.767
Bit of prep for the book, if I do it.

13:19.807 --> 13:23.402
Interview me? Are you sure?
I've never been interviewed before.

13:23.447 --> 13:26.200
That's hilarious, actually.
Me, being interviewed.

13:26.247 --> 13:27.885
'Just for family colour, really.

13:27.927 --> 13:31.158
'Like the story of how you did,
or possibly didn't, become a lesbian. '

13:31.207 --> 13:35.598
Come on then, what's the big news? Is it
something disgusting? Trying for a baby?

13:35.647 --> 13:38.002
Or is he going to the Hague
for war crimes?

13:38.047 --> 13:41.244
It's Gwen's money.
Turns out your mother,

13:41.287 --> 13:44.677
after probate and tax and so on,
she's only going to get £20,000.

13:44.727 --> 13:48.037
What? So I only get ten grand now?

13:48.087 --> 13:51.636
That's a bit rich! Come on, Mum,
can I have it all? You'll be all right.

13:51.687 --> 13:55.760
Our plan is you get some money -
for jeans, a night out, some trainers,

13:55.807 --> 13:59.800
but your mother needs all Gwen's money
for the Corfu property.

13:59.847 --> 14:05.080
What?! So I get nothing? You can't
just take it away. This is stealing!

14:05.127 --> 14:06.355
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

14:06.407 --> 14:08.318
OK, do you want me to beg?

14:08.367 --> 14:11.245
That's fine. I'm fine with that.
I beg you for money.

14:11.287 --> 14:14.484
OK? I beg you, Mum,
as your only child,

14:14.527 --> 14:18.042
to please make me happy
by giving me my money.

14:18.087 --> 14:21.841
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe I should? Although...

14:21.887 --> 14:24.162
No. It's a no.

14:24.207 --> 14:28.200
'This is fine. I'm just back to being
poor again. It's just money. I mean,

14:28.247 --> 14:29.726
'no-one died.

14:29.767 --> 14:33.077
'No, no, Gwen died
and I haven't got her fucking money! '

14:34.687 --> 14:39.886
My teacher was a bit of a hippy
and she gave me this CND badge.

14:39.927 --> 14:43.442
I genuinely loved Miss Davis.

14:43.487 --> 14:45.000
'Case closed. '

14:45.047 --> 14:48.244
Anyway, I wore it at home
and fucking hell, Mark, Dad's face.

14:48.287 --> 14:50.676
It was like he was being given
a Tabasco enema.

14:50.727 --> 14:53.605
These are all great stories, Natalie.

14:53.647 --> 14:58.516
It'd be good to focus on your dad's
career a bit, but these are class.

14:58.567 --> 15:00.842
Let me get us some more wine...

15:00.887 --> 15:03.321
'cos you're going through this
like a thirsty gay! '

15:05.847 --> 15:07.997
Everything's shit flavoured, Mark.
It's all ashes.

15:08.047 --> 15:10.117
What am I going to do for money now?

15:10.167 --> 15:14.797
You can get a job.
People do get jobs. I've got a job.

15:14.847 --> 15:18.635
Yes, but as I've told you before, Mark,
re doing a job,

15:18.687 --> 15:21.247
because of my creativity,
it's kind of abuse.

15:21.287 --> 15:24.677
I'm thinking of selling Gunny.
I could sell it to some Yardies.

15:24.727 --> 15:27.002
No, Jeremy, Gunny lives with us now.

15:27.047 --> 15:28.878
Or I could shoot Martin.

15:28.927 --> 15:31.202
Or I could hire some Yardies
to shoot Martin.

15:31.247 --> 15:33.636
Jeremy, the Yardies aren't gonna
solve all your problems.

15:33.687 --> 15:36.724
Why do you always think the Yardies
are the answer to everything?

15:36.767 --> 15:41.557
<i>'The Yardies will help me. I just need
to get a number for the Yardies. '</i>

15:41.607 --> 15:43.837
I tell you what...

15:43.887 --> 15:47.197
let's make this next one
an Irish wine.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.807
What's an Irish wine?
'Look at me,

15:49.847 --> 15:54.079
'talking happily to a lesbian about war
and drinking Irish wine.

15:54.127 --> 15:57.961
'Good job you're dead, Norman Mailer,
cos there's a new gonzo in town! '

15:58.007 --> 16:00.965
Whisky usually makes me horny.
It's a horny drink.

16:01.007 --> 16:04.602
'When did we stop saying "randy"?
"Horny" has driven "randy" out. '

16:04.647 --> 16:07.480
Hello, Natalie. How's your dad?

16:07.527 --> 16:08.596
Jeremy...

16:08.647 --> 16:10.319
Yeah, fine, thank you.

16:10.367 --> 16:14.042
Enjoying my money, is he?
Is he lying in a bath of my money?

16:14.087 --> 16:17.443
Nude, after having sex with my mum?
Nude?

16:17.487 --> 16:20.285
Natalie, why don't you take
your wine through to my room?

16:20.327 --> 16:22.158
We can finish the interview in there?

16:22.207 --> 16:24.004
Whatever you say.

16:27.167 --> 16:31.126
Look, everything isn't always
someone else's fault, Jeremy.

16:31.167 --> 16:33.158
Actually, I think you'll find it is.

16:33.207 --> 16:36.483
You need to get over this thing
with your mum. You're not Hamlet.

16:36.527 --> 16:37.755
Stop being Hamlet. 

16:37.807 --> 16:39.877
I'll stop being Hamlet when you
stop being...

16:39.927 --> 16:42.157
'He can't think of a
Shakespearean character. '

16:42.207 --> 16:45.324
...a massive twat!

16:45.367 --> 16:48.882
'He couldn't even think of Romeo.
Romeo's easy. '

16:48.927 --> 16:53.717
Found another bottle. It's Moldovan,
but if we Irish it up a bit...

16:53.767 --> 16:56.998
'Right, OK.
Looks like the floor for me, then.

16:57.047 --> 17:00.722
'Sofa's out. Jeremy's busy murdering
pedestrians on Grand Theft Auto.

17:00.767 --> 17:04.964
'She hasn't had a wee in a while.
I hope she doesn't wee in my bed. '

17:05.007 --> 17:06.963
Don't wee the bed, Natalie.

17:07.007 --> 17:09.396
'That might filter through
to her subconscious.

17:09.446 --> 17:11.642
<i>'I hope the don't was clear enough. '</i>

17:13.087 --> 17:17.478
Mum, I can't find my good pants.
I don't want to wear the tight ones.

17:17.527 --> 17:18.596
It's PE.

17:20.047 --> 17:22.685
Natalie... is everything?

17:22.727 --> 17:26.117
I like you, Mark.
I'm showing you I like you.

17:26.166 --> 17:29.523
'Oh, God, when did she start?
This could've been going on all night. '

17:29.567 --> 17:32.843
Natalie, sorry... No... I...

17:32.887 --> 17:36.118
- Stop!
- Don't you like me?

17:36.167 --> 17:39.284
Yes, but I don't think we should...
I don't really want to...

17:39.327 --> 17:42.364
'Maybe this is what they do in the Army.
I'm being initiated! '

17:42.407 --> 17:44.557
I'm not a lesbian, Mark.

17:44.607 --> 17:48.361
Yes, OK... I...
I can see that. Point proved.

17:48.407 --> 17:51.444
But please stop, Natalie.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.557
Are you nearly there?

17:53.607 --> 17:54.960
I don't...

17:55.007 --> 17:56.486
Could you stop?

17:56.527 --> 17:58.757
Oh, dear God! Oh, dear...

17:58.807 --> 18:01.799
'I'm having an orgasm against my will!

18:01.847 --> 18:05.317
'Oh, God! She's stolen sex off me. '

18:05.367 --> 18:07.119
I like you.

18:09.327 --> 18:10.726
I liked that.

18:10.767 --> 18:12.359
Yes... OK.

18:12.407 --> 18:14.762
Think I need a wee now.

18:14.807 --> 18:17.196
Right.
'Least she didn't wee on me.

18:17.247 --> 18:18.726
'That's a positive. '

18:20.207 --> 18:21.560
 Bye, Natalie.

18:21.607 --> 18:24.360
- Have you had breakfast?
- Yes.

18:24.407 --> 18:26.079
What did you have?

18:26.127 --> 18:27.765
Mainly Nurofen.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.765
How was the rest of your evening
with Peaches Stalin?

18:30.807 --> 18:32.604
Oh, OK. Bit funny.

18:33.807 --> 18:38.722
I woke up with Natalie shagging me
and I wasn't really into it.

18:38.767 --> 18:42.760
I asked her to stop. But she didn't.
That was a bit of a weird one.

18:42.807 --> 18:45.446
You asked her to stop
but she carried on, anyway?

18:45.487 --> 18:47.125
Yes...

18:47.167 --> 18:50.079
It was all a bit, you know...

18:50.127 --> 18:55.121
Mark, it sounds like
you've been raped by a soldier.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.759
Like in a Mike Leigh film.

18:56.807 --> 18:58.320
Stop talking like this, Jeremy.

18:58.367 --> 19:01.279
You said no. You said
stop having sex with me, please,

19:01.327 --> 19:04.080
but she didn't listen.

19:04.127 --> 19:07.039
You, my friend, are a rape victim.

19:07.087 --> 19:08.964
It's more complicated than that.

19:09.007 --> 19:11.237
Do you have feelings of guilt, shame,
self-loathing?

19:11.287 --> 19:14.085
You know I do. Don't load the question.

19:14.127 --> 19:17.278
- Wotcha, guys.
- How did you get in?

19:17.327 --> 19:18.919
Got keys. It's easier.

19:18.967 --> 19:21.117
You still cool about me having the gun?

19:21.167 --> 19:22.885
- Yeah, sure.
- Top man.

19:22.927 --> 19:26.124
- What do you mean, having the gun?
- I'm renting it to Super Hans.

19:26.167 --> 19:28.078
- What?
- I need to frighten this geezer.

19:28.127 --> 19:32.359
It's gone frilly. Need to wave a gun
at a guy, get him to back off.

19:32.407 --> 19:33.635
Got any Marmite?

19:33.687 --> 19:35.086
No. No way!

19:35.127 --> 19:37.243
Come on, Mark.
Don't piss on my strawberries.

19:37.287 --> 19:40.518
Don't mind Mark, Super Hans.
He's a bit down in the dumps.

19:40.567 --> 19:42.285
He's been raped.

19:42.327 --> 19:44.045
Yeah? You got raped?

19:44.087 --> 19:48.080
A woman continued to have sex with me
after I asked her to stop, that's all.

19:48.127 --> 19:50.766
Sounds like you were raped to me, Mark.
Classic case.

19:50.807 --> 19:54.243
It wasn't rape, all right?
It was just a minor sexual assault.

19:54.287 --> 19:58.565
She didn't force anything up my bum -
that's why it's not rape.

19:58.607 --> 20:00.120
Well, it's not bum rape, no.

20:00.167 --> 20:03.523
You never said it was bum rape, Mark.

20:03.967 --> 20:05.923
Do you think you're gonna
write this book, then?

20:05.967 --> 20:08.322
I dunno. He sounded
very positive on the phone.

20:08.367 --> 20:10.164
- I've got a title for you.
- Yeah?

20:10.207 --> 20:12.641
Yeah. The Memoirs Of A Thieving,
Conniving,

20:12.687 --> 20:15.121
Murdering, Stealing,
Cheating Motherfucker.

20:15.167 --> 20:17.727
You're not going to cause an incident,
are you, Jeremy?

20:17.767 --> 20:19.439
This is really important to me!

20:19.487 --> 20:22.365
No, of course not!
I'm going to go to the hotel,

20:22.407 --> 20:26.002
say goodbye to Mum. Tell her I've never
loved her, wish her bon voyage.

20:26.047 --> 20:28.686
Look, I'm just saying goodbye.
I am a human being.

20:28.727 --> 20:32.606
'Please don't shit on my dreams,
I don't want shit on my dreams. '

20:34.287 --> 20:37.996
That's the first lot of diaries, Mark.
The Malay years.

20:38.047 --> 20:41.835
Great. I'll start making notes straight
away. Thank you so much, Martin.

20:41.887 --> 20:43.764
'Look out, Beevor, I'm on your ass! '

20:43.807 --> 20:46.002
You've got Natalie to thank, really.

20:46.047 --> 20:48.925
She's been very enthusiastic about you.

20:48.967 --> 20:50.639
'Maybe that was actually good sex.

20:50.687 --> 20:53.520
'Loosen up, Corrigan. This is
what happens in the bedroom now.

20:53.567 --> 20:56.127
'No old-fashioned
fumbling and kissing.

20:56.167 --> 21:00.285
'A lesbian rapes you while you
dream about your mother. It's edgy. '

21:00.327 --> 21:05.720
Some of it's a bit choice, Mark. A bit
fruity, death-wise. You have been warned!

21:05.767 --> 21:07.997
Doesn't bother me, Martin.
The fruitier the better.

21:08.047 --> 21:09.560
War's never a picnic.

21:09.607 --> 21:12.883
Although, obviously, soldiers do end up
eating outdoors quite a lot.

21:12.927 --> 21:18.001
Yes, I'm going to check out now,
pay up, save us some time.

21:18.047 --> 21:19.685
I'll finish up here.

21:21.247 --> 21:24.683
Ahh, it's been lovely seeing you,
pumpkin.

21:24.727 --> 21:25.876
'Shut up, Mum. '

21:25.927 --> 21:27.963
I'm sorry about this
boring money business!

21:28.007 --> 21:32.285
It's fine. Really. Super Hans says
the band's been getting a lot of interest

21:32.327 --> 21:35.160
and I might write a porn film
with a proper story,

21:35.207 --> 21:39.325
so... good opportunities. This is
a nice room. Mind if I have a look?

21:39.367 --> 21:40.436
Mmm, sure.

21:42.127 --> 21:45.836
He seems a lot less...
Doesn't he, Mark?

21:45.887 --> 21:50.119
Yes... I might just
go and have a look round, too.

21:51.367 --> 21:53.756
What's going on? Why's Gunny here?

21:53.807 --> 21:57.561
If they can't get to Corfu, Mark, they
can't spend my money. That's physics!

21:57.607 --> 22:01.202
Jez, mate, a gun at an airport?
No, give me Gunny.

22:01.247 --> 22:04.159
No, Mark.
I won't let them run off with my money.

22:04.207 --> 22:06.323
That's why Gunny's
going on a little holiday!

22:06.367 --> 22:08.642
Twit! I've only packed my bloody...
What?

22:08.687 --> 22:11.360
- That's a gun.
- Give me Gunny, Jeremy.

22:11.407 --> 22:13.284
Oh, fuck off, Mark! You're not Taggart.

22:13.327 --> 22:17.525
You're aiming the gun at me?
You're going to shoot me, Jeremy?

22:17.567 --> 22:19.319
I was just stretching my arm.

22:19.367 --> 22:22.040
'He's abducting Gunny. '

22:22.087 --> 22:25.602
It's deactivated.
Most of these things are.

22:25.647 --> 22:29.322
'Deactivated. It's like he's told me
my cock doesn't work.

22:29.367 --> 22:30.595
'Poor deactivated Gunny. '

22:30.647 --> 22:35.038
Jackie, we're going!
Your son is an idiot!

22:36.687 --> 22:39.155
I'm so sorry, Martin. Really.

22:39.207 --> 22:41.482
You don't want the diaries back,
do you?

22:41.527 --> 22:44.758
You're not responsible for Jeremy, Mark.
We'll talk when we get back.

22:44.807 --> 22:46.604
Have a lovely time in Corfu.

22:46.647 --> 22:48.285
Natalie raped Mark.

22:48.327 --> 22:49.362
What?!

22:49.407 --> 22:52.444
- Bye, then.
- Mark? Is that what you told him?

22:52.487 --> 22:54.762
Go on, Mark.
Tell Martin what happened.

22:54.807 --> 22:58.595
I'm telling the police and the papers
unless I get my money.

22:58.647 --> 23:00.160
Mark?
'Close, doors, close. '

23:00.207 --> 23:04.120
There was a misunderstanding.
That's all, Martin. Crossed wires.

23:04.167 --> 23:08.319
It wasn't a proper rape at all.
Nothing went up my bum. Off you go.

23:08.367 --> 23:10.961
What do you mean, rape?
What are you talking about?

23:11.007 --> 23:13.567
Well, I did actually say stop.

23:13.607 --> 23:18.044
But let's just completely forget,
forever, what Jeremy just said. You go.

23:18.087 --> 23:19.918
Don't let her off, Mark.

23:19.967 --> 23:23.118
She's OJ. She's guilty as fuck.
Tell the truth!

23:23.167 --> 23:26.000
Yes, please do!
Tell the fucking truth.

23:26.047 --> 23:29.960
Why am I suddenly the bad guy?
He's the one with the gun!

23:30.007 --> 23:35.479
<i>She's the one who... not raped me, but...
How come I'm the villain?</i>

23:35.527 --> 23:36.801
'Doors closing. '

23:36.847 --> 23:40.681
'No, not the diaries! I've lost
the battle of the war diaries!

23:40.727 --> 23:44.606
'Back to the trenches
of credit management. '

23:44.647 --> 23:47.445
Well, Mummy's gone.
So you're my mummy again now.

23:49.047 --> 23:52.198
'And I'm gonna have to
suck on your dry teat forever! '

23:59.767 --> 24:01.644
<i>Paranoia, paranoia</i>

24:01.687 --> 24:04.679
<i>Everybody's comin' to get me</i>

24:04.727 --> 24:07.605
<i>Just say you never met me</i>

24:07.647 --> 24:12.801
<i>I'm runnin' underground
with the moles, diggin' holes</i>
