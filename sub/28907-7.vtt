Dennis tipped me off to the fact
that this guy had

Tom is a mopar fanatic,

mr. Norm's ramcharger van.

08:20.830 --> 08:23.360
Now, mr. Norm here
in the chicago area

08:23.370 --> 08:26.670
was literally mr. Mopar.

08:26.670 --> 08:28.600
Mr. Norm had a dodge dealership
in chicago

08:28.600 --> 08:31.070

and became a huge success

08:31.070 --> 08:33.240

The 440 engine was unique

09:27.860 --> 09:29.700
for its web-shaped
combustion chambers.

09:29.700 --> 09:33.130
The dana 60 axle was also used
on the challenger and the cuda,

09:33.140 --> 09:35.900
so combined up,
it's a classic muscle-car setup.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.000
There's mr. Norm.

I got this kick-ass van.
It was mr. Norm's.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.450
You ever heard of mr. Norm's
out of the chicago area?

15:19.450 --> 15:22.080
No. There's a guy who
owns a donut shop in
new york named mr. Norm.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.250
No. No. No.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.920
This guy was well-known
in the early '70s

15:24.920 --> 15:27.120
for everything mopar,
super popular dude.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.560
Somewhere along the way,
he decided to build his own van.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.030
It's all tricked out with
a drag car on the side of it,

15:32.030 --> 15:33.530
shag carpets, swivel seats.

15:33.530 --> 15:34.730
Perfect.
You name it.

15:34.730 --> 15:35.830
Well, I need to sell it.

15:35.830 --> 15:37.200
Search the net,
and find me a mr. Norm

15:37.200 --> 15:38.560
fan that wants
to buy this thing.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.000
You think that'll go?
It's a van.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.330
Vans are cool, man.

15:41.340 --> 15:43.400
Richard:
I paid $16,000 for this
mr. Norm's van.

15:43.410 --> 15:44.970
All I need to do is make
a little bit of profit,

15:44.970 --> 15:47.610
so I've got russell, and he
is going to try to turn up

15:47.610 --> 15:50.110
one of the many hordes
of mr. Norm's fans,

15:50.110 --> 15:52.450
and hopefully they got $20,000
or $30,000 in their pocket.

15:52.450 --> 15:54.680
Alright. See if there's any
action on the web.

15:54.680 --> 15:55.920
Somehow I got to
keep you employed.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.580
There's a whole building
and a kitchen

15:57.590 --> 15:58.820
and all these projects.

15:58.820 --> 16:00.450
Can I use the van
as a work van?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.360
Oh, absolutely not.
We're selling it for profit.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.060
Damn it.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.260
-What do you got there?
-Hitch a ride here.

16:11.270 --> 16:12.500
Got y'all an engine.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.930
So our '68
mustang needs a new motor.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.900
This thing overheats every time
richard drives it,

16:15.900 --> 16:17.340
so I need to get the new one
out of the box,

16:17.340 --> 16:20.970
see what needs to be painted
and make sure it all matches up.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.510
Open this thing up.
I got y'all a 347 stroker motor.

16:24.510 --> 16:27.010
Really?
So he just had a 302 before.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.350
Jason: I think we got
a major upgrade here.

16:28.350 --> 16:29.820
Figured
he'd want better power.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.580
As if he didn't already burn
the tires off of it enough.

16:31.590 --> 16:32.990
Yeah,
we got it from summit,

16:32.990 --> 16:34.890
so we were able to get it,
like, today.

16:34.890 --> 16:36.690
I like everything except
that ugly distributor.

16:36.690 --> 16:37.920
Yeah. Exactly.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.330
Brian: This motor is just
what the mustang needs.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.290
It's a stroker, which means
the piston stroke is longer,

16:41.300 --> 16:42.560
which allows
for more combustion,

16:42.560 --> 16:43.860
and that means more power.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.830
This motor pushes about
415 horsepower.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.270
It's almost going to
double the power.

16:47.270 --> 16:50.400
Guys like richard buy a lot
of motors, and we know why.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.740
Let's get it on the stand
and ready for paint.

16:57.050 --> 16:59.210
Is that your new boba fett
outfit?

16:59.210 --> 17:00.510
What? What?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.180
No, dude, you know how hot
it's been in there.

17:02.180 --> 17:05.420
This hood, ac respirator.
Aren't you lucky?

17:05.420 --> 17:07.750
So you plug it in, and it blows,
like, cold air.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.060
Could you get me one, too?

17:09.060 --> 17:10.220
Are you jealous?

17:10.230 --> 17:11.920
Well, you know,
there's two of us, right?

17:11.930 --> 17:13.060
Well, you can...
I'll share with you.

17:13.060 --> 17:14.590
I'm not sharing your hood.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.360
I'm not licking it.

17:16.360 --> 17:19.530
Just go paint something.

17:19.530 --> 17:22.840
Jealous.
Stingy.

17:22.840 --> 17:25.740
I hope that [bleep] breaks.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.440
To pretty this ugly beast
up some,

17:27.440 --> 17:29.640
mike: I'll shoot the underside
an engine compartment

17:29.640 --> 17:31.110
while we've got
the motor torn out.

17:31.110 --> 17:33.750
It's just a time crunch
on this one.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.580
If I was painting this car to be
judged like a restored shelby,

17:36.580 --> 17:37.920
we'd take it down
to metal, prime it

17:37.920 --> 17:40.020
and then paint it like
carroll shelby would,

17:40.020 --> 17:42.820
but we're building
it to be driven, not judged.

17:42.820 --> 17:44.590
The goal is to make it
presentable,

17:44.590 --> 17:47.360
so the undercarriage and engine
bay get a fresh satin black,

17:47.360 --> 17:48.960
and then jason and them
can start stabbing

17:48.960 --> 17:51.600
the new motor
and transmission and all that.

17:51.600 --> 17:56.740
♪

17:56.740 --> 17:58.600
richard:
We hit a critical point
in the riviera build.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.340
I'm investing $300,000
to turn this

18:00.340 --> 18:03.840
1972 land yacht into a super car
to show it off at sema.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.280
All right.

18:05.280 --> 18:08.010
The plan is to make this riviera
look more like a zr1 corvette.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.650
Slam it on a new chassis
and suspension,

18:09.650 --> 18:12.120
and give it bronze wheels
and big tires.

18:12.120 --> 18:14.090
The top gets chopped
for a more aggressive look,

18:14.090 --> 18:16.920
and power, well,
that's a supercharged lt ford

18:16.930 --> 18:18.860
delivering about 1,000 horses.

18:18.860 --> 18:20.230
-Whoa.
-There we go.

18:20.230 --> 18:22.560
The guys have less than 5 months
now to get it all done.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.800
We're just talking about things
that are really time-consuming,

18:24.800 --> 18:26.770
and we're really already
under the gun.

18:26.770 --> 18:29.000
Richard:
Now, while mike coy has got
the mustang in paint,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.200
the guys can make progress
assembling the custom frame

18:31.210 --> 18:33.470
that we got from
chris dawson's chassis works.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.010
Man:
You realize the scale of the car

18:36.010 --> 18:38.140
when you have the chassis
laid out like this.

18:38.150 --> 18:40.450
All this stuff is a little bit
oversized right now too,

18:40.450 --> 18:42.550
just to make sure we had
enough material to cut it in.

18:42.550 --> 18:44.780
Oh, so you'll be able to adjust,
fine-tune everything.

18:44.790 --> 18:45.750
Yes.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.120
How long until the frame
is put together?

18:48.120 --> 18:50.320
Tomorrow.
No. I'm just kidding.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.290
Yeah. That's a great answer.
We'll stick with that.

18:52.290 --> 18:54.930
Let's knock it out.

18:54.930 --> 18:57.060
Josh: The parts are made
to our specifications,

18:57.070 --> 18:58.460
but we have to weld it
all together

18:58.470 --> 19:00.670
and dial it in perfectly
straight and level.

19:00.670 --> 19:02.300
Hit it.
Hit it.

19:06.910 --> 19:09.640
For this super build,
jeremy and I are team fabricate.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.380
The frame,
it's super universal.

19:13.380 --> 19:14.650
Yeah, we have
a front crossmember.

19:14.650 --> 19:16.250
We have the rear independent
all set up.

19:16.250 --> 19:17.880
All the control arms
are figured out.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.690
We just have to kind of put the
pieces together for our needs.

19:20.690 --> 19:23.120
I mean, the car is wider
than most cars.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.590
The car is longer
than most cars,

19:24.590 --> 19:26.830
so chassis works does a great
job about leaving

19:26.830 --> 19:28.160
extra in every direction.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.130
They totally provided us
with what we needed.

19:30.130 --> 19:32.200
It was awesome.
Yeah.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.930
Jeremy: We're really excited
to be building this car,

19:33.940 --> 19:36.400
but with less than 5 months
until sema, for once,

19:36.400 --> 19:39.040
richard may have bit off
more than we can chew.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.540
Everything is a little longer
than it should be,

19:40.540 --> 19:42.380
so we can cut it to size.

19:42.380 --> 19:45.950
I'm just going to chop
the extra off.

19:45.950 --> 19:47.580
I'll add the little brace in.

19:50.220 --> 19:51.450
Set the body on.

19:51.450 --> 19:53.290
Make it to the next step.

19:53.290 --> 19:55.090
Oh, man.

19:55.090 --> 19:57.820
I got to cut the stupid bar
back off.

Narrator: ...The shelby build
gets shafted.

-Chadwick, get the door.
-Door me.

20:29.820 --> 20:31.420
Okay.

Brian: It's a big day
for richard's '68 mustang.

20:33.330 --> 20:35.130
The plan is to get the motor,
transmission and exhaust

20:35.130 --> 20:36.700
all buttoned up
and have the car on the ground

20:36.700 --> 20:38.400
by the end of the day.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.800
Oh, you bastard.

20:39.800 --> 20:40.900
Tony's going to give me a hand
with the brake lines

20:40.900 --> 20:44.400
while the guys stab
the motor.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.010
Mike: It's a small detail,
but choosing the correct

20:46.010 --> 20:48.570
engine paint is vital to keeping
an authentic shelby look.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.410
After 1965, ford committed
to corporate blue engine paint,

20:51.410 --> 20:53.410
so that's what
we're going with.

20:53.410 --> 20:55.350
Wait a minute.
I'm over mine.

20:55.350 --> 20:56.620
Are you over yours?
-Yeah.

20:56.620 --> 20:57.750
Man: Yep.

20:57.750 --> 20:58.750
Jeremy: Those cobra-branded
valve covers,

20:58.750 --> 20:59.920
that's one of those
visual cues

20:59.920 --> 21:02.390
making this mustang
look shelby authentic.

21:02.390 --> 21:06.290
I need to go under to get
the mounting bolts.

21:06.290 --> 21:07.290
All right.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.490
-Perfect.
-Go, team. We did it.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.830
Go fords!

21:09.830 --> 21:12.000
Okay.
Transmission time.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.900
We relied on ford parts
to keep the car looking

21:15.900 --> 21:18.600
cobra authentic,
bonus points if they fit right,

21:18.610 --> 21:20.770
but the monster transmission
is after market,

21:20.780 --> 21:22.040
and, well, that might be like
jamming the wrong

21:22.040 --> 21:23.180
piece into a puzzle.

21:23.180 --> 21:24.440
Ready?

21:24.450 --> 21:25.880
Why'd you give me
the heavy side?

21:25.880 --> 21:29.680
Why did we get the two smallest,
shortest guys here to do this?

21:43.600 --> 21:45.630
You think?

21:45.630 --> 21:47.500
It won't fit around
the transmission unit.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.400
Josh:
With the new transmission,
this factory crossmember

21:49.400 --> 21:50.870

39:01.340 --> 39:03.600
-Not stock.
-Is that really 8.7 liters?

39:03.600 --> 39:05.770
Brian: So that's like a
600-cubic-inch motor, too.

39:05.770 --> 39:07.540
Now, in the mach 1s
that were this color,

39:07.540 --> 39:09.270
they had
the reflective stripe, right?

39:09.280 --> 39:10.810
Man: Yes, on the mach 1s,
yes. Yeah.

39:10.810 --> 39:11.940
Richard: Yeah. All right.
Where we going?

39:11.950 --> 39:13.140
-All right.
-Where are the real cars?

39:13.150 --> 39:14.510
Richard, well, if you
can ever get him to...

39:14.510 --> 39:15.880
He just...
He veers off.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.050
Is it an r, or is...

39:17.050 --> 39:18.520
What did you start with,
just a basic shelby?

39:18.520 --> 39:20.590
-The gt.
-I wouldn't mind building one.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.520
Jason:
If we build a car like this,
just for example,

39:22.520 --> 39:25.760
that battery cable setup
is 3gs by itself.

39:25.760 --> 39:29.160
So how much is this
$3,500 mustang?

39:29.160 --> 39:30.930
You got '69 and '70
mach 1s.

39:30.930 --> 39:33.930
You've got
early model gt cars.

39:33.930 --> 39:36.100
You've got brand-new
ford gts.

39:36.100 --> 39:38.740
-Yeah.
-Golly, this car is just killer.

39:38.740 --> 39:41.840
You know what it needs?
A big, giant r right there.

39:41.840 --> 39:45.440
This guy had one in gulf livery,
and I really wanted the car.

39:45.450 --> 39:48.780
Jason:
He's got one of each gt40 in all
three different iterations.

39:48.780 --> 39:50.080
Man:
Yep, '68, 2006 and the '18.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.950
All gulf blue livery,
that's awesome.

39:51.950 --> 39:53.420
So what do you want for it?

39:53.420 --> 39:55.090
It would start
probably about 2 million.

39:55.090 --> 39:58.420
Man, I was really strong
at 1.

39:58.430 --> 39:59.960
If I gave you
2 million for it...

39:59.960 --> 40:01.930
I'd just keep smiling,
and you wouldn't get to have it.

40:01.930 --> 40:03.160
That guy is living right
if he can turn down

40:03.160 --> 40:04.460
2 mils just like that.
-Yeah, you're right.

40:04.460 --> 40:06.130
If you want to sell it
for 2 million, you call me.

40:06.130 --> 40:07.300
I'm your buyer.
-Okay.

40:07.300 --> 40:09.470
I can wire it
within 45 minutes.

40:09.470 --> 40:11.840
Just between us,
I didn't have the 2 million.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.840
I'll say, daphne
is going to be...

40:13.840 --> 40:15.040
Richard: Come on.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.780
There's something I want
to check out over here.

40:17.780 --> 40:22.150
This is a car I've always
wanted, kr500 four-speed.

40:22.150 --> 40:23.820
Please tell me
it's a four-speed.

40:23.820 --> 40:25.050
-Automatic.
-Damn it.

40:25.050 --> 40:26.180
-I'd still do it.
-Still close.

40:26.190 --> 40:27.790
Man, look how original
the car is.

40:27.790 --> 40:29.090
Richard:
So I saw my favorite car,

40:29.090 --> 40:30.320
I mean, the car I've been
looking for all my life.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.490
-Lime gold.
-Lime gold

40:31.490 --> 40:34.930
-lime gold.
-Five hundred kr, convertible.

40:34.930 --> 40:36.260
I bet it's original
all the way around.

40:36.260 --> 40:37.900
Fe motor, 428 cobra jet,
front [indistinct].

40:37.900 --> 40:40.530
It's original everything, huh?
Are you the owner?

40:40.530 --> 40:42.070
Yes, I am.
Richard rawlings, how you doing?

40:42.070 --> 40:43.500
Dennis snow,
nice to meet you.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.000
And this is your car,
one owner?

40:45.010 --> 40:47.070
This is my car,
one owner for 50 years.

40:47.070 --> 40:48.810
-God, it's gorgeous.
-Wow.

40:48.810 --> 40:50.880
Freaking supercool.
All right.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.940
Richard:
You know I'm going to ask,
dennis, how much?

40:52.950 --> 40:54.650
-How much what?
-For this car?

40:54.650 --> 40:56.050
[ laughs ]

40:56.050 --> 40:58.420
come on.
You've owned it for 50 years.

40:58.420 --> 40:59.780
Yeah.

40:59.790 --> 41:03.190
It's time to let somebody else
have the privilege.

41:03.190 --> 41:05.290
I figure this car,
at a good auction,

41:05.290 --> 41:08.190
would bring $130,000-$150,000
in today's market,

41:08.200 --> 41:10.800
but I'll give you $200,000
for this car right now.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.230
-Wow.
-Wow.

41:12.230 --> 41:14.430
I offered him $200,000,
which is $50,000 over...

41:14.430 --> 41:15.700
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-...What it's worth.

41:15.700 --> 41:17.640
-Not now.
-That's the love, right?

41:17.640 --> 41:19.300
Should I go get the beer
and come back in a minute?

41:19.310 --> 41:20.770
[ laughter ]

41:20.770 --> 41:22.140
might get him a beer too
while you're at it.

41:22.140 --> 41:23.680
Then I offered him
$201,000.

41:23.680 --> 41:26.780
And he just starts
laughing at you.

41:26.780 --> 41:28.710
Maybe in a few years,
but not right now.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.250
-Dennis, thank you, man.
-Thank you.

41:30.250 --> 41:31.750
-Supercool car.
-Appreciate it.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.550
Best car out here, I don't
care about even the new ones.

41:33.550 --> 41:36.050
-This is rad.
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

41:36.060 --> 41:37.220
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

41:37.220 --> 41:38.620
Richard: I think we knocked it
out of the park.

41:38.630 --> 41:41.090
This was a big win, and if I'm
right, which I usually am,

41:41.090 --> 41:42.730
this opened up
a whole new market for us.

41:42.730 --> 41:44.560
We're just going to stick it on
the trailer, get it back home,

41:44.560 --> 41:46.900
and then now I can actually
start driving it again.

41:46.900 --> 41:49.030
I been a very bad car owner
for, like, 5 years.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.300
Yes.

41:50.300 --> 41:51.270
Please take care of this one
a little better, please.

41:51.270 --> 41:52.640
-Yes. Enjoy it.
-Oh, no.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.340
As long as I got y'all, I can
do anything I want to to it.

41:54.340 --> 41:55.510
Well, if he doesn't drive
it, you and I are going to
take it out and drive it.

41:55.510 --> 41:56.640
Hey. I'm down with that.

41:56.640 --> 41:57.840
Let's do it.
-It's a nice car.
