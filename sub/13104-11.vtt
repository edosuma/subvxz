(man) * CROUCHED UNDER
A STILL BLUE SKY *

00:03.570 --> 00:05.720
* I KEEP CALM LIKE
THE HURRICANE'S EYE *

00:05.770 --> 00:08.989
* NO PAIN, NO SORROW I FIND *

00:09.040 --> 00:12.009

REMEMBER NO PAST *

00:12.040 --> 00:14.235

YOUR FIRST AND YOUR LAST *

00:16.680 --> 00:17.977
I STILL DON'T GET IT.

00:18.010 --> 00:20.376
(panting) WELL, MAYBE
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT, HUH?

00:20.420 --> 00:22.547
* THERE AIN'T NO SUCH THING
AS FEAR *

00:22.590 --> 00:23.716

00:23.750 --> 00:25.047
OOH!

NICE TAKE. NICE TAKE.

00:25.090 --> 00:26.387

00:26.420 --> 00:28.559
I'M JUST SAYIN',
YOU AND SWAREK WERE SOLID.

00:28.590 --> 00:29.852

00:29.890 --> 00:31.027
* AIN'T NO SUCH THING AS FEAR *

00:31.060 --> 00:32.891
SUCKA.
(Chuckles)

00:32.930 --> 00:34.727
OKAY. GOOD.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.524
PEOPLE STAY TOGETHER.
PEOPLE BREAK UP. WHATEVER.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.197
WELL, YOU SEEM TO BE
DEALING PRETI'Y WELL.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.164
WHAT ELSE AM I GONNA DO?
I MEAN, I HAVE THE CHOICE.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.404
I EITHER FALL APART
OR KEEP MOVING,

00:43.440 --> 00:44.862
AND I CHOOSE
TO KEEP MOVING.

00:44.910 --> 00:46.104
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:46.140 --> 00:47.778
WITH EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
WITH GAIL AND TRACI,

00:47.810 --> 00:50.677
MY ROMANTIC LIFE IS NOT
AN ISSUE.

00:50.710 --> 00:52.211
YEAH, IT KINDA PUTS IT
INTO PERSPECTIVE.

00:52.250 --> 00:53.842
I'M GETTING OVER IT.
I'M FINE.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.370
* 'CAUSE IT'S A WAR ZONE
OUT HERE *

00:55.420 --> 00:56.648
NICE.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.885
* THERE AIN'T NO SUCH THING
AS FEAR *

00:58.920 --> 01:00.478
* AND THE END IS ALWAYS NEAR *

01:00.520 --> 01:03.159
* SO, BABY, BRING IT ON *

01:03.190 --> 01:04.418
GREAT WORKOUT,

01:04.460 --> 01:06.223
ALTHOUGH SHE TOTALLY CLEANED
MY STOVE. (Chuckles)

01:06.260 --> 01:08.228
IT WAS BRUTAL.

01:08.260 --> 01:09.796
SO YOU'RE TAKING ME IN, RIGHT?

01:09.830 --> 01:11.297
ABSOLUTELY. THAN KS AGAIN
FOR LENDING ME YOUR TRUCK.

01:11.330 --> 01:12.866
OH, THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

01:12.900 --> 01:15.039
MUST BE A PRETTY BIG
DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.

01:15.070 --> 01:16.537
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE TAKING
THE WHOLE DAY.

01:16.570 --> 01:19.801
NOT JUST DOCTOR. DENTIST,

01:19.840 --> 01:21.376
I DO 'EM ALL,
SAME DAY, ONCE A YEAR.

01:21.410 --> 01:23.207
OPTIMIZATION
OF TRANSPORTATION.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.138
(Chuckles) OKAY.

01:25.180 --> 01:26.647
YOU COMING?

01:26.680 --> 01:27.715
(keys jangle)
RIGHT BEHIND YA.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.217
JUST GO'I'I'A GRAB MY COAT.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.081
(Clicks tongue)
(jangles)

01:31.120 --> 01:32.712
(horn honks in distance)

01:32.760 --> 01:36.423
(beeps)

01:37.760 --> 01:40.024
HEY. IT'S ME.

YEP. I MEAN, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO

01:49.910 --> 01:51.901
OH, SO THAT MEANS YOU GET

01:51.940 --> 01:55.034
FINE. LET'S SEE

01:55.080 --> 01:58.868
(Changing radio stations)

01:58.910 --> 02:01.140
(Chuckles)

02:01.180 --> 02:03.842
(turns off radio)
WHOA! GOOD GOD, MAN.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

02:03.890 --> 02:05.482
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW

02:05.520 --> 02:08.159
YEAH, WELL, WE GOTI'A GET YOU

02:08.190 --> 02:10.021
BECAUSE YOU ARE
A VIRILE YOUNG MAN.

02:10.060 --> 02:12.358
(Chuckles)
WE NEED TO GET YOU
SET UP HERE.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.493
HEY, YOU KNOW I DON'T ACTUALLY
NEED A RIDE TO WORK, LIKE,

02:14.530 --> 02:16.020
EVERY SINGLE DAY, RIGHT?

02:16.060 --> 02:17.027
(turn indicator Clicking)

02:17.070 --> 02:18.367
DUDE, I'M GOOD.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.063
NO, I KNOW. I JUST...
I LIKE THE COMPANY.

02:23.140 --> 02:24.767
OH.

02:24.810 --> 02:27.131
AND THE SPARKLING
CONVERSATION.

02:28.410 --> 02:29.547
OKAY.
(turns on radio)

02:29.580 --> 02:30.945
OHH.

02:30.980 --> 02:32.106
(man) * YEAH *
(woman) * ALL NIGHT *

02:32.150 --> 02:33.708
* WELL, THESE ARE THE FACTS *

02:33.750 --> 02:35.377
(laughs)

02:35.420 --> 02:37.980
* ...FROM SCRATCH,
OH, SHE LIKES MY RAPS *
* OH *

02:38.020 --> 02:39.749
I CAN'T LOSE YOU
RIGHT NOW, CALLAGHAN.

02:39.790 --> 02:41.018
I'M ALREADY SHORT
A DETECTIVE.

02:41.060 --> 02:42.652
YOU'VE GOT NASH STARTING
BACK TODAY.

02:42.690 --> 02:45.523
SHE CAN TAKE OVER
SOME OF JERRY'S CASE FILES.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.198
YOU'RE IN A RUSH TO GET OUT
OF HERE. I GET IT.

02:47.230 --> 02:48.857
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.629
PROJECT DAKOTA?

02:51.530 --> 02:53.361
HEARD ABOUT IT
AT HEADQUARTERS.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.334
IT'S A BIG DEAL.
CONGRATULATIONS.

02:55.370 --> 02:57.099
NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

02:57.140 --> 02:58.209
(Chuckles)

02:58.240 --> 02:59.207
(lowered voice)
WELL, WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT

02:59.240 --> 03:00.901
WHO YOU NEED
IN TERMS OF PEOPLE.

03:00.940 --> 03:02.544
MAJOR TASK FORCE
ON ORGANIZED CRIME.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.400
WE GOT THE BEST OF THE BEST
RIGHT HERE.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.668
YEAH, I'LL KEEP THAT
IN MIND.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.416
WHAT? YOU'LL KEEP THAT
IN MIND?

03:09.450 --> 03:10.417
YOU SPENT YEARS
IN THIS BUILDING.

03:10.450 --> 03:11.417
WHERE'S YOUR LOYALTY?

03:11.450 --> 03:12.417
(lowered voice)
LOOK, FRANK,

03:12.460 --> 03:14.849
15's IN
A ROUGH PATCH, OKAY?

03:14.890 --> 03:16.118
YOUR NUMBERS ARE DOWN.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.457
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT THAT
A DETECTIVE WAS KILLED

03:17.490 --> 03:19.082
IN THE LINE OF DUTY.

03:19.130 --> 03:21.519
OUR NUMBERS HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH ABILITIES OR TALENTS.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.869
I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT PEOPLE
ARE STARTING TO NOTICE.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.061
GETTING ANY OF YOUR PEOPLE
ON A MAJOR TASK FORCE RIGHT NOW

03:26.100 --> 03:27.328
WOULD BE A TOUGH SELL.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.911
(clatters)

03:55.600 --> 03:58.592
(indistinct conversations)

04:04.370 --> 04:06.372
WHY ARE YOU IN UNIFORM?

04:06.410 --> 04:07.604
ALREADY CLEARED IT
WITH FRANK.

04:07.640 --> 04:09.130
(Frank)
ALL RIGHT. LISTEN UP.

04:09.180 --> 04:11.148
AS OF TODAY, WE'RE PUTTING
THE PAST BEHIND US,

04:11.180 --> 04:12.738
WHICH MEANS
WE'RE MOVING FORWARD.

04:12.780 --> 04:14.509
OFFICER SWAREK,
"BACK TO BASICS"--

04:14.550 --> 04:16.108
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU?

04:16.150 --> 04:18.687
IT MEANS HIT THE STREETS.
FOOT PATROLS, TRAFFIC STOPS.

04:18.720 --> 04:19.948
THAT'S RIGHT.

04:19.990 --> 04:22.208
TALK TO TEN PEOPLE.
MAKE TWO ARRESTS.

04:22.260 --> 04:25.923
BACK TO BASICS, PEOPLE.
I WANT TO SEE RESULTS TODAY.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.520
MCNALLY, COLLINS,
ANDERSON, PEARCE,

04:28.560 --> 04:31.620
I WANT YOU GUYS AT JARVIS,
SHERBOURNE, AND CARLTON.

04:31.670 --> 04:33.638
GET OUT OF YOUR CARS.
GET ON THE STREETS.

04:33.670 --> 04:35.069
BE PROACT IVE.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.533
(lowered voice) I GUESS
NUMBERS ARE DOWN AGAIN.

04:36.570 --> 04:38.504
(lowered voice) YOU THINK?

04:38.540 --> 04:40.872
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing in distance)

04:40.910 --> 04:42.707
NASH?

04:42.750 --> 04:43.978
CAN YOU COME HERE A SECOND?

04:44.010 --> 04:46.843
(radio chatter)

04:46.880 --> 04:48.370
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:48.420 --> 04:49.489
FRANK DIDN'T TELL YOU?

04:49.520 --> 04:50.646
TELL ME WHAT?

04:50.690 --> 04:53.250
(clears throat)
IT'S MY FIRST SHIFT BACK,

04:53.290 --> 04:57.750
AND I JUST THOUGHT THAT...
I SHOULD START ON THE STREET,

04:57.790 --> 04:59.155
YOU KNOW, GET BACK
ON THE HORSE.

04:59.190 --> 05:00.521
HOW LONG?

05:01.530 --> 05:04.067
LOOK, NASH, I'VE BEEN
SAVING FILES FOR YOU.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.534
I'M DEALING WITH JERRY'S
ENTIRE CASELOAD ON MY OWN.

05:06.570 --> 05:08.868
I JUST NEED
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.039
I-I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT,

05:11.070 --> 05:13.072
BUT YOU'VE BEEN OFF
A MONTH ALREADY,

05:13.110 --> 05:16.648
AND THIS DETECTIVE JOB--
THIS IS A TRAINING ROTATION,

05:16.680 --> 05:18.602
SO IF YOU CAN'T DO THIS,
YOU NEED TO LET ME KNOW,

05:18.650 --> 05:21.118
BECAUSE I GOTTA FIND
SOMEBODY WHO CAN.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.855
IT WON'T EVEN--IT'LL BE,
LIKE, UNINTENTIONALLY ALL--

05:27.890 --> 05:29.619
HEY. MCNALLY, HOW YA DOIN'?

05:29.660 --> 05:30.684
GOOD. FINE. YOU?

05:30.730 --> 05:31.685
READY TO GET BACK
TO BASICS?

05:31.730 --> 05:32.697
YES, SIR.

05:32.730 --> 05:34.698
HEY, HEY. HEY, WAIT.
WAIT UP.

05:34.730 --> 05:37.619
(radio chatter)

05:37.670 --> 05:39.729
HEY. (sighs)

05:39.770 --> 05:41.567
UH, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

05:42.710 --> 05:43.836
OKAY.

05:45.770 --> 05:48.637
UM... (sighs)

05:48.680 --> 05:50.102
UH, MY KEYS,
UM, TO THE TRUCK.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.401
I JUST, UM,
IT'S MY ONLY OTHER SET.

05:51.450 --> 05:53.008
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET
THOSE BACK.

05:53.050 --> 05:56.247
KEYS. YEAH. UH...

05:56.280 --> 05:57.588
I THINK
THEY'RE IN MY LOCKER.

05:57.620 --> 05:59.042
I CAN GO GRAB 'EM RIGHT NOW
FOR YOU.

05:59.090 --> 06:01.149
NO, NO. LATER'S FINE.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.918
ALL RIGHT.
HAVE A GOOD SHIFT.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.496

06:07.960 --> 06:09.769
DIAZ, COME ON! LET'S GO!

06:09.800 --> 06:11.825
(Chuckles)
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

06:11.870 --> 06:13.792
SEE YA.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.899
BACK TO BASICS. I LOVE IT.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.067
(siren wailing)

06:18.110 --> 06:19.259
(door opens)

06:19.310 --> 06:20.572
HEY, DID YOU CHECK
YOUR WEAPON?

06:20.610 --> 06:21.577
YES.

06:21.610 --> 06:22.577
AND YOUR RADIO'S TURNED ON?

06:22.610 --> 06:23.679
YES, GAIL.

06:23.710 --> 06:24.699
HEY, WHO KNOWS
WHAT KIND OF BAD HABITS

06:24.750 --> 06:25.808
YOU PICKED UP AT THE D's?

06:25.850 --> 06:28.569
I MEAN, THIS IS
REAL POLICING RIGHT HERE.

06:28.620 --> 06:30.986
(radio chatter)

06:31.020 --> 06:32.248
(horn honks)

06:32.290 --> 06:33.257
THERE YOU ARE.

06:33.290 --> 06:34.257
(sniffles, voice breaking)
HEY.

06:34.290 --> 06:35.257
I WAS LOOKING
FOR YOU INSIDE.

06:35.290 --> 06:36.587
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE
GONE IN--

06:36.630 --> 06:38.427
YEAH, NO.
I'M, UH, I'M A KEENER,

06:38.460 --> 06:40.599
SO... (sniffles)

06:40.630 --> 06:41.756
(seat belt buckle Clicks)
YOU OKAY?

06:41.800 --> 06:43.768
(sniffles)
YEAH, I'M FINE. WHY?

06:43.800 --> 06:44.926
LET'S GET TO WORK.

06:44.970 --> 06:45.891
(starts engine)

06:45.930 --> 06:47.898
(sniffles)

06:47.940 --> 06:49.259
(exhales deeply)

06:49.300 --> 06:51.632
(radio chatter)

06:51.670 --> 06:54.309
DISOBEYING A TRAFFIC LIGHT,
IMPROPER LANE CHANGE,

06:54.340 --> 06:56.945
FAILURE TO SIGNAL,
TAILLIGHT OR HEADLIGHT OUT--

06:56.980 --> 06:59.301
TODAY NOTHING ESCAPES
OUR NOTICE.

06:59.350 --> 07:00.317
(radio chatter)

07:00.350 --> 07:02.545
SO YOU'VE BEEN DOING
ALL RIGHT?

07:02.590 --> 07:05.081
I MEAN, CONSIDERING
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED

07:05.120 --> 07:07.156
AND--AND YOU AND ANDY
BREAKING UP?

07:07.190 --> 07:08.782
DIAZ.
RIGHT. YEAH.

07:08.820 --> 07:09.980
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT, THAT'S COOL, TOO.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.590
RED COROLLA UP AHEAD.
NOTICE ANYTHING?

07:12.630 --> 07:15.622
BUSTED TAILLIGHT. NICE.

07:18.300 --> 07:21.269
(radio chatter)

07:23.770 --> 07:27.001
YOU KNOW, MY WORST BREAKUP,
I CRIED EVERY DAY FOR TWO WEEKS.

07:28.340 --> 07:31.400
NO, BUT I DID BUY
A MOTORCYCLE

07:31.450 --> 07:33.645
AND JOINED THE ARMY, SO...

07:33.680 --> 07:34.908
I DON'T KNOW.

07:34.950 --> 07:36.417
AND THEN I GREW A MUSTACHE.

07:36.450 --> 07:37.781
(Chuckles)
(Chuckles)
YOU KNOW HOW SOME GUYS

07:37.820 --> 07:40.311
LOOK REALLY GOOD WITH MUSTACHES
AND SOME GUYS JUST DO NOT?

07:40.360 --> 07:43.181
WELL, I DO NOT,
AND I WENT TO AFGHANISTAN,

07:43.230 --> 07:46.688
AND ALL THESE GUYS WERE LIKE,
"I CANNOT BELIEVE--"

07:46.730 --> 07:50.461
"GOOD RIDDANCE: HOW TO DITCH
THAT LOSER AND KEEP SMILING."

07:50.500 --> 07:52.934
WOW. OKAY.
YOU DEFINITELY WIN.

07:52.970 --> 07:55.234
YEAH. MY MOM GOT IT FOR ME.
SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP ME.

07:55.270 --> 07:56.703
SO DID IT?

07:56.740 --> 07:59.004
I DON'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T
READ IT ALL THE WAY YET.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.702
(sniffles)

08:01.740 --> 08:03.970
(keypad beeping)
I DON'T KNOW.
GUY SEEMED KINDA FRAZZLED.

08:04.010 --> 08:05.773
COUPLE OF BABY SEATS
IN THE BACK.

08:05.810 --> 08:07.368
MAYBE WE SHOULD CUT HIM
A BREAK.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.741
TWO PRIORS
FOR DOMESTIC ASSAULT.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.417
BEATS HIS WIFE.

08:11.450 --> 08:13.554
WE LET HIM OFF
'CAUSE SHE WON'T PRESS CHARGES.

08:13.590 --> 08:15.581
TURNS AROUND,
BEATS HER AGAIN.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.748
OKAY, BUT RIGHT NOW ALL WE GOT
IS A BUSTED TAILLIGHT.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.655
GOOD THING
WE'RE BACK TO BASICS.

08:20.700 --> 08:23.692
(radio chatter)

08:26.100 --> 08:28.568
(sighs)

08:28.600 --> 08:31.603
(radio chatter continues)

08:36.750 --> 08:38.206
NOT A GOOD DAY FOR YOU,
MY FRIEND.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.547
YOU ROLLED RIGHT THROUGH
THAT STOP SIGN

08:39.580 --> 08:41.616
WHEN YOU MADE YOUR TURN
BACK THERE.

08:41.650 --> 08:44.289
UH, YOUR REAR MARKER,
THE LITTLE LIGHT OVER THE TOP

08:44.320 --> 08:47.517
OF YOUR LICENSE PLATE--
NOT ILLUMINATED.

08:49.260 --> 08:51.979
FAILURE TO SIGN YOUR
VEHICLE REGISTRATION IN INK.

08:52.030 --> 08:55.022
YOU USED A PENCIL.
THAT'S A SEPARATE OFFENSE.

08:56.130 --> 08:59.099
FAILURE TO PRODUCE
INSURANCE DOCUMENTS,

08:59.130 --> 09:01.667
AND YOU HAVE
A BROKEN TAILLIGHT.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.907
FIVE TICKETS?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

09:03.940 --> 09:05.362
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
FIVE TICKETS?

09:05.410 --> 09:06.877
WE DON'T MAKE
THE RULES, SIR.

09:06.910 --> 09:08.730
OH, FORGET IT!
I'M NOT PAYING THESE!

09:08.780 --> 09:09.747
PLEASE STEP OUT
OF THE CAR, SIR.

09:09.780 --> 09:10.747
OH, COME ON!

09:10.780 --> 09:12.577
(seat belt buckle Clicks)

09:12.620 --> 09:14.576
OVER HERE, SIR.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.214
I WANT YOUR BADGE NUMBERS,
BOTH OF YOU.
WE'RE JUST DOING OUR JOB, SIR.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.343
YEAH? AND I PAY
YOUR SALARIES, JACKASS.

09:19.390 --> 09:22.052
NEVER HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE.
DO YOU WRITE YOUR OWN MATERIAL?

09:22.090 --> 09:23.250
SCREW YOU.

09:23.290 --> 09:25.588
AND THAT'S CALLED
"ASSAULTING AN OFFICER."

09:25.630 --> 09:26.949
HERE WE GO.
OHH! HEY.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.319
SIR, I NEED YOU
TO HOLD STILL.
OW!

09:28.360 --> 09:29.668
(handcuffs Click)

09:29.700 --> 09:31.793
"RULE NUMBER 3--DO NOT TALK
TO YOUR EX FOR 60 DAYS."

09:31.830 --> 09:33.468
OOH, WELL, GOOD THING
YOU GUYS DON'T WORK TOGETHER.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.365
OKAY, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO READ IT OUT LOUD.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.606
IT SAYS HERE YOU NEED
A BREAKUP BUDDY,

09:36.640 --> 09:38.460
RULE NUMBER FIVE--
"SOMEONE WHO WILL KICK YOUR ASS

09:38.510 --> 09:39.875
AMD MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW
THE RULES."

09:39.910 --> 09:40.877
SKIPPING IT.

09:40.910 --> 09:42.070
OH, MY GOD.

09:42.110 --> 09:43.543
YOU WANT ME TO BE
YOUR BREAKUP BUDDY.

09:43.580 --> 09:44.672
ANDY, I AM TOUCHED.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.302
(laughs) SHUT UP.

09:46.350 --> 09:47.442
(radio static)

09:47.480 --> 09:48.617
(woman)
1520, we've got a vehicle fire

09:48.650 --> 09:50.709
at Queen and Cowan
at St. Julian's Church.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.411
_ Please att_end.
Fire has been dispatched.
(static)

09:52.450 --> 09:54.384
1520. SHOW US _RESPONDING.
(static)

09:54.420 --> 09:56.729
(receiver Clicks, siren wailing)

09:56.760 --> 09:59.752
(indistinct conversations,
flames crackling)

10:03.030 --> 10:04.691
(static)
1520.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.630
VEHICLE IS INDEED ON FIRE.

10:06.670 --> 10:08.297
PUT A RUSH
ON THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.
(static)

10:08.340 --> 10:12.037
(extinguisher spraying)

10:12.070 --> 10:13.378
WHOA! WHOA!

10:13.410 --> 10:16.072
HEY! MOVE BACK! GET BACK!
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

10:16.110 --> 10:18.578
HEY, COME ON!
I GOT TEN CRATES OF TOMATO SAUCE
IN THERE. COME ON!

10:18.610 --> 10:19.747
OKAY.
COME ON, SIR.
LET'S GO, PLEASE.

10:19.780 --> 10:21.668
COME ON. COME ON!

10:21.720 --> 10:23.449
COME ON. MOVE BACK.
GET AGAINST THE BUILDING.

10:23.490 --> 10:24.445
BACK UP
AGAINST THE BUILDING.

10:24.490 --> 10:27.084
NO, ALL FOUR OF YOU.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.656
IS THAT YOUR CAR THERE?

10:28.690 --> 10:31.921
(speaks indistinctly)

10:31.960 --> 10:33.655
(sighs)

10:33.700 --> 10:37.363
***

10:38.870 --> 10:41.964
I WAS UNLOADING STUFF
INTO THE KITCHEN.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.308
TWO MINUTES I MUST HAVE
BEEN DOWN THERE.

10:43.340 --> 10:46.229
WHEN I CAME BACK UP,
THE VAN WAS ON FIRE.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.806
YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYONE
AROUND IT?

10:47.840 --> 10:48.807
NO.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.148
NO ONE RUNNING AWAY?

10:50.180 --> 10:51.909
NOBODY.

10:51.950 --> 10:53.417
IS THERE ANYONE YOU CAN THINK OF
THAT MIGHT WANT TO HURT YOU?
(Siren whoops)

10:53.450 --> 10:56.908
I'M A PRIEST. WHO WOULD WANT
TO HURT A PRIEST, RIGHT?

10:56.950 --> 10:58.713
WELL, SOMEONE'S TRYING
TO SEND YOU A MESSAGE.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.150
PROBABLY SOME JUNKIE
I PISSED OFF.

11:01.190 --> 11:02.726
I GOT ONE RULE--
YOU SHOW UP HIGH,

11:02.760 --> 11:04.751
YOU GET NOTHING.
NO EXCEPTIONS.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.280
SO YOU THINK A JUNKIE SET
YOUR VAN ON FIRE?

11:06.330 --> 11:08.423
IT COULD BE. I MEAN,
IT'S PRETTY EASY, RIGHT?

11:08.460 --> 11:11.327
A BEER BOTTLE HALF-FULL
OF GAS, STUFF A RAG IN IT.

11:11.370 --> 11:12.837
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.
TAKES TWO MINUTES.

11:12.870 --> 11:14.758
(radio chatter)

11:14.800 --> 11:15.835
HEY, YOU MIND
IF I GET IN THERE?

11:15.870 --> 11:17.406
I MAY BE ABLE
TO SALVAGE SOMETHING.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.998
UH, NO. SORRY, FATHER.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.075
CRIME SCENE, RIGHT?

11:20.110 --> 11:21.805
WELL, IT'S ALL
A WRITE-OFF, ANWVAY.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.479
JUST 'CAUSE SOMETHING'S
DAMAGED DON'T MEAN

11:24.510 --> 11:26.774
YOU GOTTA TH ROW IT AWAY.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.139
LET YOU KNOW
WHEN WE'RE DONE.

11:28.180 --> 11:29.670
MM-HMM.

11:31.850 --> 11:34.057
(Traci) NONE OF THESE KIDS WAS
OUTSIDE WHEN IT HAPPENED.

11:34.090 --> 11:35.557
(Gail) YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE PRIEST?

11:35.590 --> 11:38.150
WELL, HE SAYS HE DIDN'T
SEE ANYTHING.

11:38.190 --> 11:39.657
BUT...
WELL... (sighs)

11:39.690 --> 11:40.691
I DON'T KNOW.
I MET THIS GUY BEFORE.

11:40.730 --> 11:41.924
HE DOESN'T MISS A TRICK.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.461
WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO HIDE?

11:43.500 --> 11:44.967
HE RUNS
A PROGRAM FOR STREET KIDS.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.262
HE GIVES 'EM A SAFE PLACE
TO SLEEP.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.495
HE FEEDS THEM. HE TRIES TO GET
THEM OFF DRUGS.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.428
MAYBE HE'S PROTECTING
ONE OF HIS KIDS.

11:50.470 --> 11:51.437
YEAH, IT'D BE
A PRIEST-LIKE THING TO DO,

11:51.470 --> 11:52.778
TURN THE OTHER CHEEK.

11:52.810 --> 11:53.777
WELL, EITHER WAY,
IT'S A DEATH THREAT,

11:53.810 --> 11:55.129
SO WE HAVE TO TAKE IT
SERIOUSLY.

11:55.180 --> 11:56.602
YOU COMING?

11:56.640 --> 11:57.743
MAYBE WE TALK
TO ONE OF THE LOCALS,

11:57.780 --> 11:58.747
SEE IF THEY SAW SOMETHING?

11:58.780 --> 12:00.475
LET'S DO IT.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.648
(grunts) LET ME GUESS.
BRICK COLLECTION?

12:03.690 --> 12:05.089
(Closes door)
TEXTBOOKS. (chuckles)

12:05.120 --> 12:06.644
LISTEN, DOV,
THANKS FOR HELPING ME MOVE

12:06.690 --> 12:08.282
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.981
I JUST--I JUST DIDN'T HAVE
ANYONE ELSE TO CALL.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.759
NO, I TOLD YOU,
WHATEVER YOU NEED,

12:11.790 --> 12:13.553
BUT... ALONG
WITH ALL THESE BOOKS,

12:13.600 --> 12:14.658
YOU'RE ALSO GONNA NEED
SOME FURNITURE.

12:14.700 --> 12:15.758
FIRST TIME MOVING OUT,

12:15.800 --> 12:17.199
MAYBE YOUR MOM WILL SPRING
FOR A NEW COUCH.

12:17.230 --> 12:19.596
SHE'S HELPED ENOUGH
WITH MED SCHOOL.

12:19.630 --> 12:21.632
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT ONCE SHE SEES
HOW EMPTY YOUR APARTMENT IS.

12:21.670 --> 12:23.501
I DON'T WANT HER HELP.
BESIDES, I DON'T THINK

12:23.540 --> 12:24.962
SHE'S GONNA BE
COMING BY HERE ANYWAY.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.773
OKAY. NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

12:26.810 --> 12:27.799
THAT'S RIGHT. (sighs)

12:27.840 --> 12:29.171
BUT IF IT WERE,
I MIGHT ASK.

12:29.210 --> 12:31.701
MY MOM FOUND OUT
I WAS TALKING TO YOU.

12:33.980 --> 12:35.971
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
MOVING OUT?

12:36.020 --> 12:39.808
IT'S--IT WAS MY DECISION.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. I LEFT.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.920
SO ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME MOVE
OR WHAT?

12:47.060 --> 12:48.721
(Traci) NOBODY'S TALKING.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.261
YEAH, WHAT A SURPRISE.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.325
I ALMOST FORGOT
HOW HARD IT WAS.

12:52.370 --> 12:53.735
SEE, THIS IS
EXACTLY MY POINT.

12:53.770 --> 12:55.567
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
A CAKEWALK OUT HERE,

12:55.600 --> 12:59.058
AND YOU SPENT ALL THAT TIME
TRAINING TO BE A DETECTIVE.

12:59.110 --> 13:00.907
JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO TH ROW IT AWAY.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.532
I'M NOT THROWING IT AWAY.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.241
I'M JUST TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHERE I FIT.

13:04.280 --> 13:07.044
HERE WE GO. 1:00.

13:08.650 --> 13:12.142
SO THOSE ARE THE CORNER GUYS,
THE ONES TAKING THE ORDERS?

13:12.190 --> 13:14.556
YEAH, EXCEPT I THINK WE MIGHT
BE CRAMPING THEIR STYLE.

13:14.590 --> 13:15.909
(police radio chatter)

13:15.960 --> 13:19.452
WHERE ARE THE RUNNERS,
THE KIDS WHO DELIVER THE DRUGS?

13:19.490 --> 13:22.493
(Children Speak indistinctly)

13:24.070 --> 13:25.890
(radio chatter continues)

13:25.930 --> 13:28.467
GOD, LOOK AT THEM. THEY COULD
CARE LESS THAT WE'RE HERE.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.367
AS LONG AS THEY'RE UNDER 12,
THEY'RE PRACTICALLY IMMUNE.

13:31.410 --> 13:35.130
HEY. YOU KIDS WANT
TO HAVE A CHAT?

13:35.180 --> 13:36.602
HEY!

13:36.640 --> 13:38.073
HEY!

13:38.110 --> 13:41.876
OW! LET GO! LET ME GO!
OH, D-DON'T BE
SO DRAMATIC.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.080
THIS IS TOTAL BRUTALITY!

13:43.120 --> 13:44.940
YOU JUST HIT ME IN THE FACE
WITH A SLUSHIE.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.810
OKAY, YOU LITTLE PUNK?
SO GUESS WHAT?

13:46.860 --> 13:49.078
YOU CAN GO FOR A RIDE
IN MY SQUAD CAR.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.428
YOU OKAY?

13:51.360 --> 13:54.227
LIKE I SAID,
IT'S NOT EXACTLY A CAKEWALK.

13:54.260 --> 13:56.728
LAST THREE MONTHS, CHURCH BEEN
VANDALIZED SIX TIMES--

13:56.760 --> 13:58.921
BROKEN WINDOWS, GRAFFITI...

13:58.970 --> 13:59.891
(knock)

13:59.940 --> 14:01.396
HEY. YOU GOT A MINUTE?

14:01.440 --> 14:03.499
NO.

14:03.540 --> 14:07.078
FATHER JEAN PIERRE SOLAINE.
FIVE YEARS FOR ARMED ROBBERY.

14:07.110 --> 14:10.500
TH REE FOR AGGRAVATED ASSAULT.
GOT OUT OF PRISON IN 2006.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.916
SO HE WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST GUY
TO FIND GOD IN JAIL.

14:12.950 --> 14:14.645
(Nick) THINK HE KNOWS
WHO SET THE VAN ON FIRE.

14:14.680 --> 14:17.183
'COURSE HE DOES.
HE'S NOT GONNA TELL YOU.

14:17.220 --> 14:20.212
LOOK, PEOPLE CONFIDE IN HIM,
TELL HIM THEIR SINS.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.818
ONE HONEST CONVERSATION
WITH THIS GUY,

14:21.860 --> 14:24.954
I COULD PROBABLY
CLOSE 18 CASES.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.628
CURTIS PAYNE.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.059
(keyboard Clicks, beep)

14:28.100 --> 14:30.022
LOCAL DEALER.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.992
HIRES THE NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS.

14:32.030 --> 14:33.497
FATHER JEAN PIERRE'S
BEEN PUSHING BACK FOR YEARS.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.292
YOUR VAN FIRE PROBABLY HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT.

14:35.340 --> 14:37.308
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PRIEST
IS DOING SOMETHING RIGHT.

14:37.340 --> 14:39.035
LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO GET
ANY TRACTION WITH THIS,

14:39.070 --> 14:40.207
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
AN EYEWITNESS,

14:40.240 --> 14:41.776
SOMEBODY WHO CAN
PUT CURTIS AT THE FIRE.

14:41.810 --> 14:43.004
IF YOU CAN GET
CURTIS PAYNE ON THIS--

14:43.050 --> 14:44.802
THEN WE CAN TRADE UP
AND GET TO HIS SUPPLIERS.

14:44.850 --> 14:46.044
BACK TO BASICS.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.810
CURTIS PAYNE IS NO JOKE.
HE'S DANGEROUS, OKAY?

14:48.850 --> 14:50.442
ANDY, I'M SERIOUS.

14:52.690 --> 14:56.478
CURTIS BUYS THEM ANYTHING
THEY WANT--RUNNING SHOES, iPOd--

14:56.520 --> 14:58.522
HE EVEN TAKES 'EM
TO HOCKEY GAMES.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.892
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT THESE KIDS
WANT, IS ATTENTION, HUH?

15:00.930 --> 15:02.727
THAT'S WHY NOBODY
SNITCHES ON HIM.

15:02.760 --> 15:05.365
CURTIS JUST SUCKS THEM
INTO THE LIFE, AND THEY'RE LOST.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.436
THEY END UP IN JAIL OR DEAD.

15:07.470 --> 15:09.358
THE FATHER TRIES TO MAKE SURE
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.937
HE DID THE SAME THING FOR ME.
I USED TO WORK THE STREETS.

15:11.970 --> 15:13.278
HEY, YOU WANT TO
GIVE ME A HAND WITH THIS?

15:13.310 --> 15:14.800
SURE. WHERE'S THIS GOING?

15:14.840 --> 15:16.944
DOWNSTAIRS.
CORY WILL SHOW YOU WHERE.

15:16.980 --> 15:19.278
FOLLOW ME.
LEAD THE WAY.

15:19.310 --> 15:20.572
GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU, TOO.

15:20.620 --> 15:21.575
OKAY.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.042
AND THERE WE GO.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.341
(police radio chatter)

15:25.320 --> 15:27.754
SEE, I KNEW YOU GUYS
WERE GOOD FOR SOMETHING.

15:27.790 --> 15:30.554
(police radio chatter)

15:30.590 --> 15:32.228
WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

15:32.260 --> 15:33.249
YEP.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.358
HERE'S FINE.
JUST MAKE A PILE.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.719
ALL RIGHT.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.660
SOUNDS LIKE FATHER JEAN PIERRE'S
DOING PRETTY GOOD WORK.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.725
YEAH, I GUESS.

15:39.770 --> 15:43.501
HEY, CORY? ANY IDEA WHO MIGHT
HAVE BURNED THE VAN TODAY?

15:43.540 --> 15:44.859
IT WAS CURTIS, FOR SURE.

15:44.910 --> 15:46.559
OH, YEAH? YOU SAW HIM?

15:47.510 --> 15:48.602
NO.

15:48.640 --> 15:53.373
OH. FATHER JEAN PIERRE
TAUGHT YOU NOT TO LIE, HUH?

15:53.420 --> 15:54.375
FATHER'S A SMART MAN.

15:54.420 --> 15:55.512
(gunshots, glass shattering)

15:55.550 --> 15:57.108
(Andy) CORY, GET DOWN!

15:57.150 --> 15:58.185
(Nick) DON'T MOVE!
CORY, ARE YOU OKAY?

15:58.220 --> 15:59.915
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!
STAY THERE!

16:01.220 --> 16:03.780
1520, 10-33, QUEEN AND COWAN.
SHOTS FIRED.

16:03.830 --> 16:06.788
(police radio chatter,
tires screeching)

16:12.330 --> 16:13.888
(holsters gun)
WHAT HAPPENED?

16:13.940 --> 16:15.339
IT'S CALLED A DRIVE-BY.

16:15.370 --> 16:16.439
EVERYONE OKAY?

16:16.470 --> 16:17.698
I'M GOOD.
YOU TAKE CARE OF HER.

16:17.740 --> 16:19.867
HEY. FATHER. COME ON.
LET US HANDLE THIS.

16:19.910 --> 16:22.777
LET YOU HANDLE THIS?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?!

16:22.810 --> 16:24.971
YOU'RE THE REASON
WE'RE GETTING SHOT AT, OFFICER.

16:25.010 --> 16:26.978
IT'S YOUR FAULT!

16:32.950 --> 16:36.283
(sirens wailing in distance)

16:39.760 --> 16:41.159
(siren whoops)

16:41.200 --> 16:43.418
WATCH YOURSELF THERE, PAL.
BIG STEP FORWARD, ALL RIGHT?

16:43.470 --> 16:46.359
GOT A CRUISER COMING IN.
COME ON. YOU GUYS?

16:46.400 --> 16:48.095
I NEED YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE STREET, ALL RIGHT?

16:48.140 --> 16:49.835
SO THE BULLETS HIT UP HERE,
TAKING OUT THE WINDOWS,

16:49.870 --> 16:51.064
AND FATHER JEAN PIERRE
WAS DOWN HERE?

16:51.110 --> 16:53.305
MM-HMM. GUESS THEY DIDN'T
HAVE VERY GOOD AIM.

16:53.340 --> 16:56.002
OR THEY'RE JUST SENDING
A MESSAGE, TRYING TO SCARE HIM.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.246
I MET THIS GUY
A FEW TIMES BEFORE.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.679
I DON'T THINK
HE SCARES THAT EASY.

16:58.710 --> 17:00.416
CALLAGHAN, YOU WANT TO GIVE ME
THE TAG, I'LL RUN IT DOWN?

17:00.450 --> 17:02.441
WE DIDN'T GET
THE LICENSE PLATE, ACTUALLY.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.414
BY THE TIME WE GOT OUT HERE,
THEY WERE GONE.

17:04.450 --> 17:07.010
I'M SORRY. SO YOU WERE
BOTH INSIDE THE CHURCH?

17:07.060 --> 17:10.018
YEAH. FATHER JEAN PIERRE
ASKED US TO BRING IN SOME GEAR.

17:10.060 --> 17:11.687
WHAT KIND OF GEAR?

17:11.730 --> 17:13.425
TOMATO SAUCE.

17:14.930 --> 17:17.626
SO YOU WERE UNLOADING GROCERIES
WHILE THE PRIEST WAS OUT HERE

17:17.670 --> 17:20.559
GETTING SHOT AT. IS THAT RIGHT?
DID ANYONE SEE THE VEHICLE?

17:20.600 --> 17:22.932
WELL, FAR AS WE CAN GATHER,
GOLD S.U.V.

17:22.970 --> 17:24.506
FULL SIZE,
MAYBE AN ESCALADE.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.360
I'LL SEE IF I CAN FIND
ANY GOLD S.U.V.S

17:26.410 --> 17:28.139
REGISTERED
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

17:28.180 --> 17:31.172
(Sam) GENIUS.
WHY DON'T YOU TWO TALK
TO FATHER JEAN PIERRE AGAIN,

17:31.210 --> 17:32.370
SEE IF HE REMEMBERS
ANYTHING ELSE?

17:32.410 --> 17:33.968
MM-HMM.

17:35.780 --> 17:38.385
SOME, UH, FANTASTIC
LEADERSHIP THERE, SAMMY.

17:38.420 --> 17:39.910
YOU WANT TO TAKE
A SHOT AT ME NEXT?

17:39.950 --> 17:41.508
GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK,
CALLAGHAN.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.515
KEEP SAYING THAT.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.221
ALWAYS A PLEASURE.

17:44.260 --> 17:46.319
HOW MANY TIMES
I GOTTA TELL YOU?

17:46.360 --> 17:48.692
THEY CAME OUT OF NOWHERE,
STARTED SHOOTING AT US.

17:48.730 --> 17:49.799
IT HAPPENED SO FAST.

17:49.830 --> 17:51.263
SO YOU DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE THE CAR?

17:51.300 --> 17:54.030
ONCE AGAIN, IT WAS A S.U.V.
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE.

17:54.070 --> 17:58.336
IT WAS CURTIS PAYNE, WASN'T IT?
WHY IS HE SHOOTING AT YOU?

17:58.370 --> 18:00.065
MAYBE 'CAUSE
WE TALKING TO THE COPS.

18:00.110 --> 18:02.601
OKAY, DID YOU GET A LOOK AT
ANY FACES? DRIVER? SHOOTER?

18:02.640 --> 18:03.743
NOTHING.

18:06.580 --> 18:08.013
CARLENE,
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING?

18:08.050 --> 18:09.870
WE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING,
AND WE'RE FINE.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.080
CAN WE GO BACK INSIDE,
PLEASE?

18:11.120 --> 18:13.918
HEY, FATHER. HEY.
YOU ALL RIGHT?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.382
(Jean Pierre) YES.

18:15.420 --> 18:16.512
I'M GONNA GET
THESE TWO OFFICERS

18:16.560 --> 18:18.027
TO STICK AROUND
AND KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS, OKAY?

18:18.060 --> 18:20.051
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.
THANK YOU. WE'RE GOOD.

18:20.090 --> 18:21.398
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
GET IN THE WAY.

18:21.430 --> 18:23.261
ALL THAT'S GONNA DO
IS UPSET THE KIDS.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.767
WELL, I'M SORRY.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.860
AFTER TODAY, I'M NOT, UH,
I'M NOT REALLY ASKING.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.197
(police radio chatter)

18:29.240 --> 18:31.060
(man) ALL RIGHT.
PULL THAT SQUAD CAR OUT OF HERE.
(sighs)

18:31.110 --> 18:34.329
(buzzer, beep)
I KNOW THE RULES. IF YOU'RE
ARRESTING ME, I GET A LAWYER.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.802
YOU'RE NOT UNDER ARREST.

18:35.840 --> 18:36.875
THEN WHY AM I HERE?

18:36.910 --> 18:38.172
WHOA, HEY, NOW.

18:38.210 --> 18:40.075
I WAS JUST STANDING THERE,
MINDING MY BUSINESS.

18:40.110 --> 18:42.010
YOU ASSAULTED AN OFFICER.

18:42.050 --> 18:43.278
PLEASE.

18:43.320 --> 18:47.086
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
CALM DOWN? HAVE A SEAT.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.008
SHE SAID, SIT.

18:51.190 --> 18:52.680
OKAY, YOU NEED TO
TELL US YOUR NAME.

18:52.730 --> 18:53.697
JORDAN.

18:53.730 --> 18:55.197
"JORDAN" WHAT?

18:56.400 --> 18:59.426
LOOK, JORDAN, WE NEED TO GET
IN TOUCH WITH YOUR PARENTS.

18:59.470 --> 19:01.438
YOU KNOW A GUY
NAMED CURTIS PAYNE?

19:01.470 --> 19:02.732
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

19:02.770 --> 19:04.601
YOU DON'T WORK FOR HIM
AS A RUNNER?

19:04.640 --> 19:07.529
NO. I WAS JUST HANGING OUT
WITH MY FRIENDS.

19:09.480 --> 19:10.640
WHAT IS THIS?

19:10.680 --> 19:12.841
LET GO! YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME!

19:15.820 --> 19:18.482
NOW YOU'RE SURE YOU DON'T WANT
ME TO HOOK ANYTHING ELSE UP?

19:18.520 --> 19:22.058
I MEAN, UH, DVD PLAYER,
TV, LAMP, CLOCK RADIO...

19:22.090 --> 19:23.182
SHH.

19:23.230 --> 19:26.757
OKAY, SO, THERE'S
BARELY ANY WATER PRESSURE,

19:26.790 --> 19:28.849
ONE OF THE WINDOWS
WON'T OPEN...
(banging in distance)

19:28.900 --> 19:30.720
AND JUDGING BY
THAT BANGING SOUND,

19:30.770 --> 19:32.226
THERE'S A GHOST
IN MY CLOSET.

19:32.270 --> 19:33.532
WELL, TH-THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

19:33.570 --> 19:35.231
MEANS YOU'LL ALWAYS
HAVE COMPANY.

19:36.270 --> 19:38.704
NO, YOU KNOW, I THINK
I'M GONNA LIKE THIS...

19:38.740 --> 19:42.369
YOU KNOW, LIVING ON MY OWN,
YOU KNOW, MY OWN MUSIC,

19:42.410 --> 19:45.277
MY OWN MESS,
NO ONE ASKING WHERE I'VE BEEN...

19:45.310 --> 19:49.349
SO, UH, WHEN DID YOU PLAN
ON FILLING ME IN ON ALL THIS?

19:49.380 --> 19:51.143
WHAT? IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.784
I JUST, LIKE, FOUND
THE APARTMENT ON craigslist,

19:53.820 --> 19:56.584
CALLED THE GUY UP,
MADE AN OFFER--SIMPLE.

19:56.620 --> 19:58.850
CRYSTAL, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.826
LOOK, MY COUSIN
SAW US TOGETHER.

20:04.970 --> 20:08.098
HE TOLD MY MOM, AND NOW
MY FAMILY WON'T TALK TO ME.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.438
WERE YOU GOING TO TELL ME
ABOUT ANY OF THIS?

20:10.470 --> 20:12.301
DOV, I DON'T CARE
WHAT THEY THINK.

20:12.340 --> 20:14.570
THEY'LL GET OVER IT,
OR ELSE IT'S THEIR LOSS.

20:14.610 --> 20:15.929
SO WHAT, YOU'RE JUST
NEVER GONNA GO HOME?

20:15.980 --> 20:17.208
WHY? DO YOU WANT ME TO?

20:17.250 --> 20:21.368
NO, I...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT.

20:21.420 --> 20:28.258
***

20:28.290 --> 20:29.450
ALL RIGHT.
(beeps)

20:29.490 --> 20:31.458
I FOUND A GOLD S.U.V.
WITH A FLAG ON THE RECORD.

20:31.490 --> 20:34.653
IT'S REGISTERED TO A BUSINESS,
THE SKYLINE RESTAURANT,

20:34.700 --> 20:36.099
AND GUESS WHO THE OWNER IS?

20:36.130 --> 20:37.097
WHO?

20:37.130 --> 20:38.097
CURTIS PAYNE.

20:38.130 --> 20:39.392
NO KIDDING.

20:39.430 --> 20:42.866
YEAH. YEAH, 1426 QUEEN STREET.
SHOULD BE RIGHT ABOUT...

20:42.900 --> 20:46.734
HERE. YOU--
YOU KNEW THAT ALREADY.

20:46.770 --> 20:48.374
I HAD A HUNCH.

20:48.410 --> 20:51.379
(siren wailing in distance)

20:51.410 --> 20:53.947
(police radio chatter)

20:53.980 --> 20:55.470
(car door Closes)

20:58.450 --> 21:01.487
(hip-hop music playing)

21:01.520 --> 21:03.181
BOYS, WHAT'S THE LUNCH SPECIAL?

21:03.220 --> 21:04.858
CLOSED.

21:04.890 --> 21:07.154
SHOULDN'T YOU KIDS
BE IN SCHOOL?

21:07.190 --> 21:08.851
HEY. CAN I SEE YOUR GUN?

21:08.900 --> 21:10.390
HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

21:10.430 --> 21:12.398
HEY, LET ME CALL YOU BACK.

21:12.430 --> 21:13.533
(beep, cell phone clatters)

21:13.570 --> 21:14.798
CAN I HELP YOU, OFFICER?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.091
YOU KNOW
WHY WE'RE HERE, CURTIS--

21:16.140 --> 21:18.438
DRIVE-BY AT ST. JULIAN'S,
GOLD S.U.V.

21:18.470 --> 21:21.007
YEAH, WE HEARD ABOUT THAT.
WORD TRAVELS.
YEAH?

21:21.040 --> 21:23.474
DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL VERY FAR
WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DID IT.

21:23.510 --> 21:24.670
AND WHO MIGHT
YOUR WITNESS BE?

21:24.710 --> 21:27.440
I DON'T NEED A WITNESS.
I KNOW IT WAS YOU.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.277
I GUESS YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY EVIDENCE, EITHER, HUH?

21:29.320 --> 21:32.619
IS THIS WHAT IT'S COME TO?
TAKING SHOTS AT A PRIEST?

21:32.650 --> 21:34.015
LOOK, I'VE BEEN
SITTING HERE ALL MORNING,

21:34.060 --> 21:35.516
TALKING TO THESE GENTLEMEN.

21:35.560 --> 21:39.121
MY VEHICLE'S BEEN
PARKED OUT BACK ALL DAY.

21:39.160 --> 21:44.223
***

21:44.270 --> 21:46.727
(groans)
OFFICER DIAZ. SUBJECT HAD
HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS.

21:46.770 --> 21:47.896
YOU KNOW WHAT WE CALL THAT?

21:47.940 --> 21:48.895
THREAT CUE.

21:48.940 --> 21:49.895
THAT'S RIGHT.

21:49.940 --> 21:50.907
PUT IT AWAY.

21:50.940 --> 21:52.464
(Curtis Chuckles)

21:52.510 --> 21:56.298
(sighs)
KIDS AND THEIR PHONES, HUH?

21:56.340 --> 21:58.308
OFFICER SWAREK,
IF HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING,

21:58.350 --> 21:59.772
I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.

21:59.810 --> 22:01.368
(sighs)

22:01.420 --> 22:04.844
CURTIS? STAY AWAY
FROM THE CHURCH, HUH?

22:04.890 --> 22:05.914
(exhales sharply)

22:05.950 --> 22:08.214
UNLESS YOU'RE THERE
FOR CONFESSION.

22:08.260 --> 22:11.252
***

22:11.290 --> 22:14.123
NICE SEEING YOU, TOO, OFFICER.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.094
HAVE A NICE DAY.

22:17.100 --> 22:18.362
(telephone rings in distance)

22:18.400 --> 22:20.459
HOW'D YOU GET
THE BURN MARKS, JORDAN?

22:20.500 --> 22:22.991
(sighs)
I DON'T TALK TO COPS.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.439
LOOK, IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION.

22:24.470 --> 22:29.339
(sighs) IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
I WAS COOKING BACON.

22:29.380 --> 22:30.779
CIGARETTE BURNS
IN A PATTERN.

22:30.810 --> 22:32.448
MIGHT BE SOME KIND
OF INITIATION.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.516
NEED TO CONTACT
CHILD AND YOUTH SERVICES.

22:34.550 --> 22:35.710
MM-HMM.

22:35.750 --> 22:38.446
SHE NEEDS TO BE INTERVIEWED
BY A DETECTIVE.

22:38.490 --> 22:41.482
(police radio chatter,
telephone rings in distance)

22:43.430 --> 22:47.082
WELL, NO FIREBOMBS OR GUNSHOTS
IN THE LAST HOUR AND A HALF.

22:47.130 --> 22:48.097
THINGS ARE LOOKING UP.

22:48.130 --> 22:49.950
OKAY, SO RULE NUMBER SIX--

22:50.000 --> 22:51.524
WE HAVE TO MAKE
A GOOD RIDDANCE LIST.

22:51.570 --> 22:53.697
SO WHAT ARE SWAREK'S
LEAST LIKABLE QUALITIES?

22:53.740 --> 22:55.833
OKAY, WE REALLY
SHOULD BE WORKING.
WE ARE.

22:55.870 --> 22:59.135
PADRE HASN'T LEFT THE CHURCH
SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE, SO...

22:59.170 --> 23:02.901
"SELFISH"? IS HE "STUBBORN"?
"ARROGANT"?

23:02.940 --> 23:03.907
(sighs)

23:03.950 --> 23:05.099
OH, COME ON. HELP ME OUT.

23:05.150 --> 23:06.777
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE
A GOOD BREAKUP BUDDY.

23:06.810 --> 23:08.141
"STUBBORN." WRITE THAT DOWN.

23:08.180 --> 23:09.408
OKAY, GREAT. WHAT ELSE?

23:09.450 --> 23:11.987
"OVERBEARING,"
"INSENSITIVE"...

23:12.020 --> 23:13.339
WHAT ABOUT "SELFISH"?

23:13.390 --> 23:14.709
YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN
TOGETHER FOR ALMOST A YEAR,

23:14.760 --> 23:16.409
AND HE HAS NOT ONCE TOLD ME
HOW HE FEELS ABOUT ME?

23:16.460 --> 23:18.155
WELL, SOME GUYS ARE JUST
TOO COOL FOR FEELINGS.

23:18.190 --> 23:19.987
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT GETS A LITTLE THIN

23:20.030 --> 23:21.622
FOR THE REST OF US,
WHO ARE WORKING REALLY HARD

23:21.660 --> 23:23.696
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE THINKING--

23:23.730 --> 23:24.719
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

23:24.770 --> 23:25.964
I'M NOT TOO COOL
FOR ANYTHING.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.764
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T WANT
TO ADMIT THIS, BUT...

23:28.800 --> 23:30.768
I'M ACTUALLY
SOMEONE'S BREAKUP BUDDY.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.061
(Chuckles)

23:32.110 --> 23:33.532
OKAY. SO THE MANTRA.

23:33.580 --> 23:34.808
(whispers) MANTRA.

23:34.840 --> 23:38.844
(both) "I, ANDY MCNALLY,
AM STILL A KICK-ASS PERSON,

23:38.880 --> 23:41.110
AND JUST BECAUSE
MY RELATIONSHIP FAILED..."

23:41.150 --> 23:43.015
"DOES NOT MEAN I'M A FAILURE."
"DOESN'T MEAN I'M A FAILURE."

23:43.050 --> 23:44.483
JUST MEANS YOU'RE UNLOVABLE.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.488
(thump)
(laughs)

23:46.520 --> 23:47.782
WHOA. HEADS UP.

23:47.820 --> 23:50.823
(police radio chatter)

23:55.530 --> 23:57.157
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

23:57.200 --> 23:59.168
LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.964
OH, NO. OH, NO. NO.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.399
NO, THANK YOU.
NO. NO, TH--

24:03.440 --> 24:05.032
WHOA. WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, NO! NO!

24:05.070 --> 24:06.037
CAR WASH, SIR?

24:06.070 --> 24:07.401
(engine starts)
STOP.

24:07.440 --> 24:08.634
STOP! NO!
WE DON'T NEED ANYTHING!

24:08.680 --> 24:10.568
GET AWAY FROM OUR CAR! STOP!

24:10.610 --> 24:12.999
(Nick) WE'RE FINE! THANK YOU!
STEP OFF THE CAR!

24:13.050 --> 24:14.870
WATCH IT WITH
THE SQUIRTING, OKAY?

24:14.920 --> 24:17.377
(tires pealing)
BACK OFF. UP AGAINST THE FENCE.
UP AGAINST THE FENCE.

24:17.420 --> 24:19.047
(groans)

24:23.120 --> 24:25.452
(horn honks in distance)

24:25.490 --> 24:29.620
CURTIS PAYNE IS A MAJOR PLAYER
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

24:29.660 --> 24:31.890
INTIMIDATION, VIOLENCE--

24:31.930 --> 24:34.330
HE'S A SUSPECT IN
SEVEN DIFFERENT ASSAULTS.

24:34.370 --> 24:36.531
IN, LIKE, SIX YEARS, WE HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO TOUCH HIM.

24:36.570 --> 24:38.458
ALL THE MORE REASON
WE NEED TO PLAY IT BY THE BOOK.

24:38.510 --> 24:40.705
INFORMANTS, UNDERCOVER BUYS--
NONE OF IT'S WORKED.

24:40.740 --> 24:44.403
HE'S TOO CAREFUL. BEST WE CAN DO
IS RATTLE HIS CAGE.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.873
SPEAKING OF WHICH...

24:46.910 --> 24:49.811
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN. LET'S GO.
HANDS AGAINST THE WALL.

24:49.850 --> 24:51.112
(man) ...TALKING ABOUT, MAN?

24:51.150 --> 24:52.913
WHAT DID I JUST SAY?
HANDS AGAINST THE WALL.

24:52.950 --> 24:54.918
(man) WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
(man) HEY, MAN! MAN!

24:54.960 --> 24:56.587
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:56.620 --> 24:58.349
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE'RE DOING,
OFFICER DIAZ?

24:58.390 --> 24:59.755
WE'RE ARRESTING CRIMINALS.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.792
ARRESTING THEM FOR WHAT?

25:01.830 --> 25:05.027
YOU DIDN'T SEE 'EM SELLING
DRUGS? I SAW 'EM SELLING DRUGS.

25:05.070 --> 25:06.697
THEY JUST SEEM LIKE
A BUNCH OF KIDS HANGING OUT.

25:06.730 --> 25:09.062
NO, NO, NO.
LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.

25:09.100 --> 25:10.362
(thud)

25:13.840 --> 25:15.671
(police radio chatter)

25:15.710 --> 25:18.178
DISPATCH IS GONNA PUT A LOOKOUT
ON FATHER JEAN PIERRE'S CAR.

25:18.210 --> 25:20.349
IS HE GONNA GET IN TROUBLE
FOR TAKING OFF?

25:20.380 --> 25:22.348
NO, HE'S NOT.
WE ARE TRYING TO PROTECT HIM.

25:22.380 --> 25:23.984
WE DON'T WANT
ANYBODY GETTING HURT.

25:24.020 --> 25:25.988
I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WENT.

25:26.020 --> 25:27.248
OKAY, WELL, DID HE TALK TO YOU
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

25:27.290 --> 25:29.178
FATHER J.P. DOESN'T
TALK ABOUT THAT STUFF.

25:29.220 --> 25:31.381
OH, COME ON, CARLENE. YOU KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON.

25:31.430 --> 25:34.854
VAN FIRE, SHOOTING--SAME DAY.

25:34.900 --> 25:35.855
(sighs)

25:35.900 --> 25:38.926
UM, CURTIS AND THE FATHER--

25:38.970 --> 25:41.234
THEY'VE BEEN HAVING
THIS WAR OVER THE KIDS,

25:41.270 --> 25:42.999
AND THEN THIS WHOLE THING
WITH THOMAS--

25:43.040 --> 25:44.735
IT JUST SET IT ALL OFF AGAIN.

25:44.770 --> 25:46.829
(Andy and Nick) WHO'S THOMAS?

25:46.870 --> 25:50.374
TOTALLY AMAZING KID. HE WAS
A SCHOLARSHIP WINNER LAST YEAR.

25:50.410 --> 25:52.378
HE USED TO HANG OUT HERE
ALL THE TIME...

25:52.410 --> 25:55.516
AND, UH, THEN, A FEW DAYS AGO,

25:55.550 --> 25:57.689
FATHER J.P.
WENT OUT AND FOUND HIM.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.642
HE WAS WORKING THE CORNERS.

25:59.690 --> 26:02.079
ON HIS ARM RIGHT HERE,
IT WAS ALL INFECTED.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.781
SOMEONE BURNED HIM
WITH A CIGARETTE.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.457
AND FATHER JEAN PIERRE
FREAKED OUT.

26:05.490 --> 26:09.494
SO THE SHOOTING--
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THOMAS?

26:09.530 --> 26:10.827
CARLEN E.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.121
HE WAS IN THE CAR.

26:12.170 --> 26:13.569
THOMAS WAS? YOU SAW HIM?

26:13.600 --> 26:15.158
HE WASN'T
THE ONE WITH THE GUN,

26:15.200 --> 26:17.907
BUT HE WAS THERE
IN THE BACK SEAT.

26:17.940 --> 26:19.703
CURTIS WAS MAKING A POINT.

26:20.840 --> 26:23.070
I THINK FATHER J.P. MIGHT HAVE
GONE OUT TO FIND THOMAS.

26:23.110 --> 26:24.543
WHERE DOES THOMAS LIVE?

26:24.580 --> 26:26.309
(door buzzes and beeps)

26:28.280 --> 26:30.441
JORDAN LEWIS.

26:31.550 --> 26:34.189
I CALLED CHILD AND YOUTH
SERVICES, AND IT TURNS OUT

26:34.220 --> 26:36.381
THERE'S NOT THAT MANY JORDANS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

26:36.420 --> 26:38.684
SO DIDN'T TAKE LONG
TO PULL YOUR FILE.

26:39.990 --> 26:43.790
YOU'VE BEEN IN FOSTER CARE
SINCE YOU WERE 2 YEARS OLD.

26:43.830 --> 26:45.923
12 DIFFERENT FAMILIES.

26:46.670 --> 26:48.069
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN TOUGH.

26:49.140 --> 26:52.007
DO YOU EVER TALK
TO YOUR REAL PARENTS?

26:52.040 --> 26:57.330
NO. THEY DON'T NEED ME.
I DON'T NEED THEM.

26:57.380 --> 26:59.746
I DON'T NEED ANYONE.

27:03.480 --> 27:04.549
HOW OLD IS THIS KID?

27:04.590 --> 27:05.989
(Traci, filtered voice)
I GET IT.

27:06.020 --> 27:08.853
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ALL ALONE,
BUT WHAT ABOUT CURTIS?

27:08.890 --> 27:10.858
I MEAN, HE MUST BE
LIKE YOUR FAMILY NOW.

27:10.890 --> 27:13.051
WHAT'S HE LIKE?
IS HE A NICE GUY?

27:13.090 --> 27:15.194
'CAUSE I KNOW HE'S GENEROUS.
I KNOW HE GIVES YOU GUYS--

27:15.230 --> 27:16.549
WHAT'S WITH THE NEW CLOTHES?

27:16.600 --> 27:17.794
SORRY?

27:17.830 --> 27:20.663
YOU WERE IN UNIFORM.
WHY'D YOU CHANGE?

27:20.700 --> 27:22.634
DID YOU THINK
I'D LIKE YOU BETTER?

27:24.870 --> 27:26.599
ACTUALLY, I DID.

27:26.640 --> 27:32.101
YOU'RE STILL A COP. I HATE COPS.
PUT ME IN JAIL, I DON'T CARE.

27:35.750 --> 27:38.116
HEY. YOU GUYS
NEED TO SEE THIS.

27:38.150 --> 27:39.708
(Traci, filtered voice) JORDAN,
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO JAIL...

27:39.750 --> 27:40.819
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

27:40.860 --> 27:44.978
COME ON.
YOU, TOO. LET'S GO.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.327
(radio chatter)

27:46.360 --> 27:49.727
I WAS GOING THROUGH THAT GIRL'S
PHONE, LOOKING FOR, UH,

27:49.760 --> 27:52.627
LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY TO CONTACT.
I FOUND THIS.

27:52.670 --> 27:53.967
(key Clicks)

27:54.000 --> 27:55.865
YOU READY, THOMAS?

27:56.870 --> 27:58.406
READY?

28:00.710 --> 28:02.928
GIVE ME YOUR ARM.

28:02.980 --> 28:03.947
COME ON, MAN.

28:03.980 --> 28:04.947
DO IT.

28:04.980 --> 28:05.947
DO IT.

28:05.980 --> 28:06.947
(sizzle)

28:06.980 --> 28:10.416
(screaming)

28:10.450 --> 28:13.419
(Children Speak indistinctly,
clapping)

28:13.450 --> 28:15.680
(Curtis) THAT'S IT,
LITTLE MAN. IT'S OVER.

28:15.720 --> 28:18.086
IT'S OVER.
WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.654
(boy) YEAH!
WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.

28:19.690 --> 28:21.294
AREN'T YOU PROUD
OF YOUR BROTHER?
WHOO! YEAH!

28:21.330 --> 28:22.627
MAKE SOME NOISE.
COME ON, GUYS.

28:22.660 --> 28:23.627
YEAH !

28:23.660 --> 28:24.661
(key Clicks)

28:26.870 --> 28:27.939
(woman) THOMAS ISN'T HERE.

28:27.970 --> 28:29.767
WELL, WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING
FOR FATHER JEAN PIERRE.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.028
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE HE IS RIGHT NOW?

28:31.070 --> 28:32.935
YOU NEED TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

28:32.970 --> 28:34.198
WELL, SOMEBODY
DROVE BY THE CHURCH,

28:34.240 --> 28:36.105
AND SHOTS WERE FIRED
AT FATHER JEAN PIERRE.

28:36.140 --> 28:37.232
IS HE OKAY?

28:37.280 --> 28:38.474
YEAH, HE'S FINE,

28:38.510 --> 28:40.102
BUT WE THINK THOMAS WAS
IN THE BACK OF THE CAR.

28:40.150 --> 28:44.211
ANDY? TRACI FORWARDED ME
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD SEE.

28:44.250 --> 28:45.410
OH.

28:46.490 --> 28:48.617
MS. YOUNG,
IS THAT YOUR SON?

28:48.660 --> 28:50.252
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HIM?

28:50.290 --> 28:51.928
CURTIS PAYNE.

28:52.730 --> 28:55.096
LOOKS AS THOUGH
HE BURNED THOMAS.

28:57.430 --> 29:00.126
J.P. CAME LOOKING FOR THOMAS
ABOUT 20 MINUTES AGO.

29:00.170 --> 29:02.297
WHY IS HE SO DESPERATE
TO FIND THOMAS?

29:04.140 --> 29:06.529
JEAN PIERRE--H--

29:06.570 --> 29:08.276
HE'S THOMAS'S FATHER.

29:08.310 --> 29:11.404
***

29:14.250 --> 29:16.639
SIR, I DON'T THINK
THESE GUYS ARE DEALERS.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.011
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

29:18.050 --> 29:19.938
I ONLY FOUND ONE JOINT
IN THIS BAG,

29:19.990 --> 29:21.981
AND NONE OF THEM
WILL TELL ME WHOSE IT IS.

29:22.020 --> 29:25.456
WELL, I GUESS WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO BRING 'EM ALL IN, THEN.
(cell phone rings)

29:25.490 --> 29:27.219
(ring, beep)

29:27.260 --> 29:28.750
McNALLY?

29:28.800 --> 29:30.199
HEY, SAM.

29:30.230 --> 29:31.959
LISTEN, WE THINK JEAN PIERRE'S
GOING AFTER CURTIS PAYNE.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.194
WHAT? WHY?

29:33.230 --> 29:35.494
BECAUSE CURTIS
HAS HIS SON--THOMAS.

29:35.540 --> 29:37.235
He was in the car
when the shots were fired.

29:37.270 --> 29:38.737
I'M SORRY.
THE PRIEST HAS A SON?

29:38.770 --> 29:40.203
YES, FROM A PREVIOUS LIFE.

29:40.240 --> 29:41.673
LOOK, I WILL EXPLAIN
ALL OF THIS LATER.

29:41.710 --> 29:43.029
WE'RE HEADING
TO SKYLINE RIGHT NOW.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.069
WE'RE GONNA SEE
IF WE CAN CATCH UP

29:44.110 --> 29:45.839
WITH JEAN PIERRE
BEFORE ANYTHING HAPPENS.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.302
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL MEET YOU THERE.

29:47.350 --> 29:49.739
LISTEN, WE KNOW CURTIS IS ARMED,
SO DO NOT GO INSIDE WITHOUT US.

29:49.780 --> 29:50.883
(beep)

29:50.920 --> 29:52.114
PEARCE SAYS HE CAN TAKE
A COUPLE OF THESE GUYS.

29:52.150 --> 29:53.959
HE CAN TAKE 'EM ALL.
WE GOT SOMEPLACE ELSE TO BE.

29:53.990 --> 29:56.709
I GOTTA GO. ALL RIGHT?

29:56.760 --> 29:57.852
(car door Closes)

29:57.890 --> 29:59.357
THOUGHT SWAREK SAID TO WAIT.

29:59.390 --> 30:00.721
SCREW SWAREK.

30:00.760 --> 30:03.797
GOD BLESS THE PROGRAM.

30:03.830 --> 30:05.366
READY?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.969
(laughter in distance)

30:14.110 --> 30:18.069
(man in distance) COME ON, SON.
(speaks indistinctly)

30:18.110 --> 30:21.944
FATHER,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN HERE.

30:21.980 --> 30:24.119
(Chuckles)

30:24.150 --> 30:27.347
THAT'S CURTIS PAYNE BACK THERE.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.119
DUDE IS SO UNTOUCHABLE.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.526
NOBODY COMES AFTER HIM, RIGHT?

30:31.560 --> 30:35.656
THAT'S RIGHT.
(Chuckles) UNTIL TODAY.

30:35.700 --> 30:40.592
WHEN HE COMES OUT THAT DOOR,
WITH GOD LOOKING OVER ME...

30:40.630 --> 30:41.858
GUN.

30:41.900 --> 30:43.561
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.329
FATHER, PUT THE GUN AWAY.

30:45.370 --> 30:47.406
ALL THESE YEARS ON THE STREETS,

30:47.440 --> 30:49.704
NOT KNOWING
IF I'M DOING ANY GOOD.

30:49.740 --> 30:53.676
(whispers) THIS RIGHT HERE--
THIS WOULD BE GOOD.

30:53.710 --> 30:54.916
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

30:54.950 --> 30:56.178
(normal voice)
YES, IT IS TRUE.

30:56.220 --> 30:58.188
THAT IS NOT TRUE.
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

30:58.220 --> 31:00.814
ONE BULLET--ONE...

31:00.850 --> 31:03.853
AND I SAVE LIVES...
KIDS' LIVES.

31:03.890 --> 31:07.189
WHO'S GETTING IT DONE?
YOU? YOU?

31:07.230 --> 31:09.198
LET ME DO WHAT I CAME HERE
TO DO, AND AFTER THAT,

31:09.230 --> 31:11.425
YOU CAN READ ME MY RIGHTS.
I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.267
THIS ISN'T UP TO YOU.
YOU DON'T GET TO DECIDE THAT.

31:13.300 --> 31:14.631
YOU'RE NOT GOD.

31:14.670 --> 31:16.968
YOU DAMN RIGHT, AND I'M-A DEAL
WITH THE GOOD LORD

31:17.000 --> 31:18.558
WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER WITH.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.407
HEY, HOW YOU DOING, MAN?

31:20.440 --> 31:21.907
HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

31:21.940 --> 31:23.976
FATHER, PUT THE GUN DOWN.
PUT IT DOWN.

31:24.010 --> 31:25.773
THAT'S THE LOOK
I WAS WAITING ON.

31:25.810 --> 31:27.243
YOU LIKE THAT, CURTIS?

31:27.280 --> 31:28.269
PUT IT DOWN.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.548
WALK AWAY.

31:29.580 --> 31:31.286
THIS IS BETWEEN ME AND CURTIS!

31:31.320 --> 31:32.617
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DO THAT.

31:32.650 --> 31:34.186
JUST SAY YOU CAME
TWO SECONDS TOO LATE.

31:34.220 --> 31:35.414
THAT'S ALL YOU GOTTA DO.

31:35.460 --> 31:36.609
YOU GONNA LET HIM DO THIS?!

31:36.660 --> 31:37.752
YO, CURTIS, SHUT UP.

31:39.490 --> 31:41.094
"THOU SHALT NOT KILL."

31:42.300 --> 31:44.120
THAT'S WHAT YOU TEACH
THE KIDS, RIGHT?

31:46.300 --> 31:47.619
(holsters gun)

31:47.670 --> 31:49.888
TEN SIMPLE RULES.

31:50.940 --> 31:54.239
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA THINK
IF YOU BREAK NUMBER SIX?

31:54.280 --> 31:55.907
WHAT ABOUT THOMAS?
WHAT'S HE GONNA THINK?

31:55.940 --> 31:58.738
THOMAS IS THE REASON
WHY I'M HERE.

32:00.210 --> 32:03.043
YOU ARE A GOOD MAN.

32:04.120 --> 32:07.112
ARE YOU REALLY WILLING
TO THROW EVERYTHING AWAY?

32:07.150 --> 32:10.881
IF YOU DO THIS, YOU'RE GONNA
LOSE YOUR SON FOREVER.

32:13.190 --> 32:15.499
HE'S GONNA FIND OUT
YOU DID THIS.

32:15.530 --> 32:17.418
HE IS.

32:18.130 --> 32:20.189
WHAT IF HE CAN'T FORGIVE YOU?

32:21.170 --> 32:23.365
WHAT IF HE CAN'T
FORGIVE HIMSELF?

32:24.170 --> 32:25.501
(whispers) DON'T.

32:25.540 --> 32:27.360
(whispers) DON'T.

32:27.410 --> 32:28.377
(normal voice) COME ON.

32:28.410 --> 32:29.729
(clatter)

32:29.780 --> 32:32.248
COME ON. (speaks indistinctly)
HANDS AGAINST THE WALL.

32:32.280 --> 32:33.702
YOU, TURN AROUND.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.012
(Curtis) YOU'RE CUFFING ME?

32:35.050 --> 32:38.941
I GOTTA SEARCH YOU. TURN AROUND.
TURN AROUND. ARMS UP.

32:42.020 --> 32:43.487
I TOLD YOU TO WAIT
TILL I GOT HERE.

32:43.520 --> 32:44.851
I HEARD YOU.

32:44.890 --> 32:46.187
(police radio chatter)

32:46.230 --> 32:47.857
TURN AROUND.

32:47.890 --> 32:50.324
(handcuffs Click)

32:50.360 --> 32:52.499
IT'S OKAY.

32:53.500 --> 32:56.936
(handcuffs Clicking)

32:58.910 --> 33:00.309
IT'S OKAY.

33:01.580 --> 33:05.368
(whispers) FORGIVE ME FATHER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED. FORGIVE ME.

33:07.610 --> 33:10.374
(telephone ringing,
indistinct conversations)

33:10.420 --> 33:13.389
(door buzzes and beeps)

33:13.420 --> 33:15.012
YOU CAN SAVE IT.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.857
I'M NOT SAYING NOTHING
TILL MY LAWYER GETS HERE.
(door closes)

33:16.890 --> 33:18.482
THAT'S COOL.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

33:18.530 --> 33:19.781
JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU

33:19.830 --> 33:22.492
WE RECOVERED THIS FROM
THE PREMISES OF YOUR RESTAURANT.

33:22.530 --> 33:24.066
WE'RE JUST WAITING ON
THE BALLISTICS REPORT,

33:24.100 --> 33:26.523
WHICH I'M ALMOST POSITIVE
IS GONNA MATCH THE SLUGS

33:26.570 --> 33:28.367
WE PULLED FROM THE MORTAR
AT ST. JULIAN'S.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.789
WELL, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE
COME AND GO FROM MY PLACE.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.569
YOU KNOW,
THAT COULD BELONG TO ANYBODY.

33:32.610 --> 33:33.702
THAT'S TRUE,

33:33.740 --> 33:35.970
BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE LOOKING
AT YOU FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

33:42.920 --> 33:45.411
(Curtis) YOU READY, THOMAS?

33:46.720 --> 33:48.153
GIVE ME YOUR ARM.

33:48.190 --> 33:50.010
(boy) COME ON, MAN.

33:50.060 --> 33:51.357
(boy) Do IT.

33:51.390 --> 33:54.496
(Thomas yelling,
children speaking indistinctly)

33:54.530 --> 33:56.851
WHATEVER.
JUST SOME PEOPLE MESSING AROUND.

33:56.900 --> 33:59.221
WELL, WHAT YOU CALL,
"MESSING AROUND," WE CALL,

33:59.270 --> 34:03.695
AGGRAVATED ASSAULT OF A MINOR.
CARRIES A PRETTY SERIOUS CHARGE.

34:03.740 --> 34:04.729
AND JAIL TIME.

34:04.770 --> 34:05.759
ASSAULT OF A MINOR?

34:05.810 --> 34:07.437
YEAH, CHILD ABUSE?

34:07.470 --> 34:10.974
CHILD ABUSE--WHAT'S THAT
GONNA DO FOR YOUR REPUTATION?

34:11.010 --> 34:14.116
I GUESS YOU COULD
CAREFULLY EXPLAIN IT

34:14.150 --> 34:16.175
TO YOUR FELLOW INMATES.

34:16.220 --> 34:19.246
MAYBE EVENTUALLY
THEY'LL SEE IT LIKE YOU DO,

34:19.290 --> 34:21.850
THAT YOU WERE JUST
"MESSING AROUND."

34:29.300 --> 34:31.666
YOU COULD JUST
GIVE US SOME NAMES...

34:31.700 --> 34:34.260
YOU KNOW, A COUPLE PLAYERS,
YOUR SUPPLIERS.

34:34.300 --> 34:36.768
MAYBE THEN WE COULD TALK
ABOUT A DIFFERENT CHARGE...

34:38.570 --> 34:40.504
LIGHTER SENTENCE.

34:41.140 --> 34:42.471
(door buzzes and beeps)

34:42.510 --> 34:44.978
WE'LL GIVE YOU SOME TIME
TO THINK THAT OVER.

34:50.450 --> 34:52.987
I GIVE HIM TILL HIS LAWYER
ARRIVES BEFORE HE CRACKS.

34:53.020 --> 34:55.181
NAH, IT'S NOT GONNA
TAKE THAT LONG.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.156
GOOD WORK ON THIS.

35:00.690 --> 35:02.829
YOU'RE WONDERING
WHAT ELSE YOU COULD HAVE SAID.

35:02.860 --> 35:04.521
NOT TO CURTIS--THE GIRL.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.788
YOU DIDN'T GET THROUGH TO HER,
AND THAT BOTHERS YOU,

35:06.830 --> 35:08.832
SO YOU'RE ALREADY PLANNING WHAT
YOU'D DO DIFFERENT NEXT TIME.

35:10.500 --> 35:11.706
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

35:11.740 --> 35:13.628
BECAUSE I'M A DETECTIVE, TOO.

35:17.980 --> 35:19.948
(door opens)

35:19.980 --> 35:23.313
THOMAS IS HERE.
HE SAYS THAT HE LET YOU DOWN.

35:23.350 --> 35:25.011
HE WANTS TO APOLOGIZE.

35:30.390 --> 35:32.028
DOES HE KNOW?

35:33.030 --> 35:34.554
I MEAN, DID YOU TELL HIM?

35:35.460 --> 35:36.825
NO.

35:36.860 --> 35:38.691
IT'S BETWEEN YOU
AND HIS MOTHER,

35:38.730 --> 35:41.062
BUT IF IT WERE ME,
I'D WANT TO KNOW.

35:50.310 --> 35:51.868
HEY.

35:51.910 --> 35:53.400
HEY.

36:02.820 --> 36:04.117
SO WHAT'S NEW?

36:04.160 --> 36:05.718
LOTS OF THINGS.

36:05.760 --> 36:09.958
OKAY, SO THIS WOMAN--SHE'S FROM
CHILD AND YOUTH SERVICES,

36:10.000 --> 36:13.128
AND SHE'S GONNA HELP YOU FIND
A NEW HOME, A NEW FAMILY--

36:15.200 --> 36:19.204
JORDAN. YOU DON'T FOOL ME,
NOT EVEN FOR A SECOND.

36:19.240 --> 36:21.504
YOUR WHOLE TOUGH GUY ACT--
I JUST DON'T BUY IT.

36:21.540 --> 36:24.077
SO I WANT YOU
TO HAVE MY CARD.

36:24.110 --> 36:25.372
I WANT YOU TO
HANG ONTO IT,

36:25.410 --> 36:28.709
AND IF ANYONE EVER HURTS YOU
OR MAKES YOU FEEL AFRAID,

36:28.750 --> 36:32.846
I WANT YOU TO CALL ME, OKAY?
THAT'S ME--GAIL PECK.

36:34.620 --> 36:35.757

36:41.800 --> 36:43.427

37:03.650 --> 37:06.210

37:10.320 --> 37:13.255

FOR WHAT YOU CAN, WHEN YOU CAN,

37:17.660 --> 37:21.596
'CAUSE THAT'S THE JOB, EVEN IF
YOU HAVE TO PUSH IT SOMETIMES.

37:23.500 --> 37:27.266
NO. IT'S NOT.
NOT FOR EVERYBODY.

37:31.350 --> 37:32.578
LOOK, I KNOW

37:32.610 --> 37:34.510

TO SAY YOU EARNED THIS TODAY.

38:28.070 --> 38:29.765

I CHANGED MY MIND.
I'M COLD.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.377
TWO WORDS--HIGH MAINTENANCE.

39:14.420 --> 39:16.877
