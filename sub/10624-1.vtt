<i>What happened to my hair?</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:37.070
<i>Looks like shit.</i>

00:45.810 --> 00:47.720
<i>I hated going to school here.</i>

00:49.500 --> 00:52.080
<i>Fuck, I'm hungry. I should've gone
to Starbucks on the way here.</i>

00:55.030 --> 00:58.670
<i>Why did I have to marry into a family
that needs to donate things like chapels?</i>

01:04.370 --> 01:06.160
<i>They hate that I'm married
to their daughter.</i>

01:06.230 --> 01:07.820
<i>They hate that I'm working at their bank.</i>

01:07.890 --> 01:09.710
<i>I hate that I'm working at their bank.</i>

01:13.590 --> 01:16.140
<i>Next summer,
they want to go shoot an elephant.</i>

01:16.210 --> 01:18.000
<i>Who the fuck
wants to shoot an elephant?</i>

01:18.060 --> 01:20.140
<i>I'll probably have to shoot an elephant.</i>

01:23.990 --> 01:26.160
<i>I'm waxy.</i>

01:26.230 --> 01:28.500
<i>The fuck, I'm old. It's depressing.</i>

01:28.570 --> 01:30.250
<i>I don't want to be old.</i>

01:30.320 --> 01:32.910
<i>I'm gonna be old and waxy
and working at a bank.</i>

01:32.980 --> 01:34.410
<i>And now my pants
are riding up my ass.</i>

01:36.110 --> 01:38.160
Do not tell the principal that I'm here.

01:44.890 --> 01:46.320
Fuck.

01:50.320 --> 01:51.780
Did someone
just run through here?

01:51.860 --> 01:55.720
Uh, no.
Not that I know of.

01:55.790 --> 01:57.650
Why? What's going on?

01:58.770 --> 02:00.910
Nothing.

02:00.980 --> 02:03.020
Just thought I saw
one of the kids running in here.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.550
No, it's just me.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.500
Oh, hey, Bill.

02:07.470 --> 02:11.340
So this is a, uh,
pretty big day for your family.

02:11.410 --> 02:13.610
You know, your father-in-law's
really outdone himself this time.

02:13.690 --> 02:16.810
The John Jacoby Family Chapel.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.920
He is truly a godsend.

02:20.370 --> 02:23.080
I heard he might run for mayor,
and to tell you the truth, I'd vote for him.

02:23.150 --> 02:25.010
He's a hell of a guy.

02:25.070 --> 02:26.220
Um...

02:26.290 --> 02:28.670
Hey, um,

02:28.750 --> 02:32.230
did anyone mention to you about the new
mentor program that we're doing here?

02:32.300 --> 02:33.580
No.

02:33.650 --> 02:36.520
Kids love the program,
and it helps them think about their futures.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.150
You know, if you're interested,
you should sign up today.

02:39.210 --> 02:41.100
We'll set you up with a student.

02:41.170 --> 02:42.600
Yeah. I'm sure. Why not?

02:42.680 --> 02:44.680
Well, listen, uh,

02:44.750 --> 02:47.270
your brother and father-in-law
are probably waiting to break ground,

02:47.350 --> 02:49.930
so I'll, uh... I'll meet you outside?

02:56.950 --> 02:58.850
You can come out now.

03:03.220 --> 03:05.130
Hey, I don't know
why you lied for me,

03:05.200 --> 03:06.790
but thanks, man.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.730
You kiddin'?

03:10.760 --> 03:12.670
You can keep your money.

03:13.970 --> 03:15.520
All right.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.510
I think I'm gonna hang out here
for a few minutes

03:17.580 --> 03:19.820
just so I don't get busted.

03:19.880 --> 03:21.160
All right.

03:32.550 --> 03:34.690
He committed to rebuilding the chapel

03:34.770 --> 03:37.350
three years ago, after the fire,

03:37.420 --> 03:41.580
and he and Janice made good.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.240
On behalf of the Tate Schools,

03:43.310 --> 03:45.890
I'm proud to present
the future site

03:45.960 --> 03:49.280
of the John Jacoby Family Chapel.

04:01.710 --> 04:03.750
Everybody looks great.
Get closer together.

04:03.820 --> 04:06.180
Bill. Bill.

04:08.200 --> 04:11.430
<i>This is Chip Johnson, On the Scene,
at the Tate Preparatory School,</i>

04:11.500 --> 04:13.770
and we have Maria Sanchez
with us here today.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.660
Here's Maria.

04:19.209 --> 04:22.250
That's the bell. Cut.

04:36.940 --> 04:38.530
Ow!
Oh, sorry! God! Honey!

04:38.600 --> 04:41.090
I'm fine. I'm fine.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.320
Oh, this is, uh, Chip Johnson.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.410
Oh.
Chip, my husband Bill.

04:49.480 --> 04:50.460
Oh.

04:51.850 --> 04:53.510
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, I just saw you out there.

04:53.580 --> 04:55.200
You're Channel 11, right?

04:55.270 --> 04:57.920
Are you on the scene?

04:57.990 --> 05:00.260
It's a favor to Mr. Jacoby.

05:00.330 --> 05:02.180
Right.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.160
Nice to meet you. Bye, Jess.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.710
You know him?

05:08.780 --> 05:09.730
No.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.770
I mean, I do now.
I met him today.

05:14.310 --> 05:15.900
He just called you Jess.

05:16.870 --> 05:18.210
Everybody calls me Jess.

05:19.170 --> 05:20.930
People who know you call you Jess.

05:20.990 --> 05:22.860
Okay, Bill.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.570
Uh, I have to go.

05:24.650 --> 05:27.770
Uh, is there anything special
you want for dinner tonight?

05:28.740 --> 05:30.400
No. Whatever's fine.

05:30.470 --> 05:32.060
Okay. Well...

05:33.630 --> 05:35.230
See you later.

05:40.360 --> 05:43.810
This is my son-in-law Bill.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.360
He's the executive vice president...

05:47.680 --> 05:49.890
...of human resources.

05:49.960 --> 05:53.470
Bill is in charge of making sure

05:53.540 --> 05:55.580
everything runs smoothly up front.

05:57.830 --> 05:59.420
Go ahead, Bill.

05:59.490 --> 06:03.450
Oh, well, if you have any questions,
uh, feel free to ask them.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.150
Um...

06:10.140 --> 06:12.420
Bill, I need five copies of this, okay?

06:35.460 --> 06:37.920
Why would I want
a doughnut franchise?

06:37.980 --> 06:40.160
It's one of the most lucrative
franchises in the country.

06:40.230 --> 06:42.430
The average store
grosses over 500K,

06:42.500 --> 06:45.150
and right now, the perceptions is
that people don't really believe in carbs,

06:45.210 --> 06:46.940
so we can get them
at somewhat of a discount.

06:47.010 --> 06:48.670
But I don't really eat doughnuts.

06:48.730 --> 06:50.710
Well, you don't need to eat them.
You don't even need to like them.

06:50.780 --> 06:52.670
Then why would I want the franchise?

06:52.740 --> 06:54.710
Investment purposes.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.950
You know, Eddy what's-his-name
down in accounting did that no-carb thing.

07:01.030 --> 07:02.300
Lost 30 pounds.

07:02.370 --> 07:03.960
Eddy Anderson.
Right.

07:04.030 --> 07:07.030
Likes to run, too. Great athlete.

07:07.110 --> 07:09.920
By the by, how's your brother?

07:10.880 --> 07:13.530
He's great. He's fine.
Great.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.730
And, uh, don't forget.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.540
We're going hunting Saturday.

07:21.600 --> 07:25.310
I'd like to speak to someone
regarding franchise opportunities.

07:29.210 --> 07:31.510
Okay. Well, I'd like to leave
my cell phone number.

07:38.430 --> 07:41.520
So, is this your bank?
I saw your face on the billboard.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.180
Yeah, I have an ownership interest.

07:44.260 --> 07:46.450
You ever go just look at the cash?

07:48.310 --> 07:49.850
Can I get a tour?

07:50.820 --> 07:52.270
Uh...

07:52.350 --> 07:54.930
- It's against the rules.
- It's your bank.

07:55.010 --> 07:57.270
- Yeah. And it has rules.
- That you make.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.700
Tell me something.

07:59.770 --> 08:03.160
Why are you interested
in having me mentor you?

08:04.190 --> 08:06.910
You work at a bank. I like money.

08:06.980 --> 08:08.570
Right.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.810
Um, well, unfortunately,

08:10.880 --> 08:13.330
it turns out that I may not be able
to participate in the program.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.860
My schedule shifted today,
and it's gonna be tight.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.430
That's rough.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.920
Mm-hmm.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.660
Well, if you do mentor me,
could I get a tour?

08:21.730 --> 08:23.380
Yeah. Let's play it by ear.

08:24.340 --> 08:26.420
All right.

08:26.490 --> 08:27.860
Thanks, Bill.

08:27.930 --> 08:29.340
You bet.

09:00.510 --> 09:01.620
Yeah.

09:03.670 --> 09:07.020
Okay, well... Yeah.

09:07.090 --> 09:09.650
Okay, so this Saturday.

09:09.720 --> 09:12.210
Yes, they're going hunting all day.

09:12.280 --> 09:13.710
Trust me.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.590
Meet me here at 10.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.060
Yeah. All right.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.820
I didn't know you were home.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.730
Where'd you get this?

09:42.300 --> 09:44.500
I really wish you'd listen to the doctor.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.840
These are gonna kill you.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.660
Were you on the phone?

09:49.650 --> 09:51.790
Yeah.

09:51.860 --> 09:54.410
My mom.

09:54.490 --> 09:56.790
Your mom... Where is she...
your mom?

09:56.860 --> 09:59.120
She's, um, home.

09:59.190 --> 10:00.500
Why?

10:00.570 --> 10:01.840
Mmm.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.200
Are you gonna answer that?

10:19.730 --> 10:21.520
Hello.

10:21.590 --> 10:23.630
Right.

10:23.700 --> 10:25.650
This is my cell phone.
Thank you.

10:26.610 --> 10:28.590
Yeah. Tomorrow, 5:30.
That'll be great.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.310
Yeah, I'll be alone.
Okay, thank you.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.130
Who was that?
It was the office.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.270
The office wants to know if you're
gonna be alone tomorrow at 5:30?

10:40.340 --> 10:42.410
It's... I'm working on a deal.

10:42.490 --> 10:43.500
A deal?

10:43.570 --> 10:45.290
Yeah. I have deals.

10:45.360 --> 10:48.460
Come on. What deal?
A financial deal.

10:48.530 --> 10:50.390
You're lying.
I am not.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.240
I can tell. You have
your hands on your hips.

10:54.770 --> 10:57.520
You know what?
A thief thinks everyone steals.

11:00.250 --> 11:02.410
That's right.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.160
Okay.

11:06.230 --> 11:07.980
I'm gonna watch TV.

11:08.050 --> 11:09.330
I'm gonna call your mom.

11:09.390 --> 11:10.440
Okay.

11:10.520 --> 11:11.490
At home.

11:11.570 --> 11:12.780
All right.

11:17.810 --> 11:19.500
<i>So again for tomorrow</i>

11:19.570 --> 11:22.420
<i>it's going to be partly sunny
with highs around 83,</i>

11:22.480 --> 11:23.720
<i>the lows in the upper 60s.</i>

11:23.790 --> 11:26.380
Your mom wasn't home.

11:29.580 --> 11:30.890
Oh, look, here it is.

11:30.960 --> 11:34.570
<i>There is nothing
more important than community.</i>

11:34.640 --> 11:36.020
Bet you a thousand dollars
he runs for mayor.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.730
<i>You know, I was, uh...</i>

11:38.800 --> 11:43.820
Is that my stomach?
Is that my stomach?

11:43.890 --> 11:46.280
Oh, my God, I'm The Blob.

11:46.350 --> 11:47.880
Okay, move, I can't see.

11:47.950 --> 11:50.370
Oh, my God.

12:16.710 --> 12:19.330
I have to remember
to go to the store.

12:19.410 --> 12:21.070
Mmm.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.730
Too bad there's not a place
where you can get

12:22.790 --> 12:24.770
a really good hot, fresh doughnut.

12:24.850 --> 12:28.140
Yeah. You really need
to cut back on the sugar.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.210
Mmm.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.530
Speaking of cutting back,

12:31.600 --> 12:34.180
I've been reviewing
our financial situation,

12:34.250 --> 12:36.830
and I think that we should
consider diversifying.

12:36.910 --> 12:38.690
Okay. Just ask my dad.

12:40.100 --> 12:43.650
Wouldn't it be nice to be less
dependent on your... father?

12:43.720 --> 12:46.310
I'm not dependent on him.

12:54.410 --> 12:56.000
Love you.

13:06.930 --> 13:09.260
<i>On the Scene.</i>

13:27.110 --> 13:29.640
"Sex and Power in America."

13:32.300 --> 13:35.500
<i>Chip Johnson. On the Scene.</i>

13:35.560 --> 13:37.700
You're everywhere, Chip.

13:38.820 --> 13:40.650
Not anymore.

13:40.710 --> 13:43.360
We'll do this.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.120
Now you're mine.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.200
Let's see who dyes their hair now.

13:51.270 --> 13:52.930
How do you like this? Whoop!

13:53.000 --> 13:56.960
Oh! I'm sorry, Chip. I chopped it.

13:57.030 --> 13:59.340
Oh, that's okay.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.750
I'm on the scene today.

14:00.810 --> 14:04.040
I just had my hair dyed last week
and my teeth whitened,

14:04.100 --> 14:05.990
and I'm feeling really good about myself.

14:06.060 --> 14:09.060
So good that I'm gonna
hop on over here.

14:09.130 --> 14:11.720
Oh, hello, darling.
Who colors your hair?

14:11.780 --> 14:13.060
Oh, I saw you on television.

14:13.130 --> 14:14.110
Oh, have you, now?

14:14.180 --> 14:16.220
Oh, yes, I watch you
at 6:00 every single night.

14:16.290 --> 14:19.230
Oh, that's so funny.
I was just wondering who dyes your hair.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.250
You okay, Bill?

14:20.330 --> 14:22.270
What?

14:22.340 --> 14:23.680
Yes, sir.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.160
Our kids from
the mentor program are here.

14:25.220 --> 14:26.170
I want you to give them a tour.

14:26.250 --> 14:27.770
Uh, okay. Which kids?

14:27.850 --> 14:30.150
Yours, mine, and John Jr.'s.
We're all doing it.

14:30.220 --> 14:34.560
Now, John Jr. and I have a meeting,
so they're waiting for you in the lobby.

14:34.630 --> 14:37.860
Oh, and the two boys are
coming hunting with us Saturday.

14:37.930 --> 14:40.710
Your brother has some guns
waiting at the store for them.

14:40.770 --> 14:44.090
I told him that you would
pick them up after work.

14:44.170 --> 14:45.630
Thanks, Bill.

14:52.070 --> 14:53.090
Hey, Bill.

14:56.670 --> 14:58.920
I thought the program
started on Monday.

14:58.980 --> 15:01.980
Mr. Jacoby thought it would be prudent
for us to get acquainted with your facility

15:02.050 --> 15:04.580
prior to the actual
commencement date.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.920
Sarah Sheldon, class of 2009.

15:06.980 --> 15:08.410
Your father-in-law's my mentor.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.860
Donald Choo.

15:09.930 --> 15:12.960
Hi, Donald. Hi, Sarah.
Nice to meet you.

15:13.020 --> 15:16.480
I don't know what you're up to,
but this is going to be a fast tour.

15:16.540 --> 15:17.560
Follow me.

15:26.570 --> 15:30.100
Uh, the question we're asked the most is
what's inside the safety deposit boxes.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.120
Well, some of these boxes haven't
been opened for over 20 years,

15:32.190 --> 15:33.400
so, uh, it's anybody's guess.

15:33.470 --> 15:35.900
And, um, the people who own
the boxes have the only key.

15:35.970 --> 15:38.040
You ever go through them,
see what people are hiding?

15:38.110 --> 15:40.150
He just told you
he doesn't have the key.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.370
Oh, come on.
There's no master key?

15:42.440 --> 15:43.780
Anyway, that's the end of the tour.

15:43.850 --> 15:47.040
- Can't we see the safe?
- Shut up, kid.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.620
We ran your financials,
and we think, potentially,

15:50.690 --> 15:51.860
you could be a good fit for us.

15:51.940 --> 15:53.790
Great.

15:53.860 --> 15:55.520
So what's next?

15:55.580 --> 15:57.790
We'll fly out later this week
and approve the site.

15:57.860 --> 15:59.800
And, of course,
there's a sort of orientation

15:59.870 --> 16:01.940
where you spend a day
at one of our main stores.

16:02.020 --> 16:04.950
Just to ensure you know exactly
what business you're getting into.

16:05.020 --> 16:06.240
You could bring your wife.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.880
Oh, that'd be great.
She'd love that.

16:13.950 --> 16:15.330
Since she'll be
your partner in this venture,

16:15.400 --> 16:16.950
we do require one meeting
with her anyway,

16:17.030 --> 16:18.940
so kill two birds with one stone.

16:19.010 --> 16:21.500
Well, she won't be involved
in the daily operations.

16:21.570 --> 16:22.510
Oh, it's a formality.

16:22.590 --> 16:26.480
She's listed as co-owner
of... all of your assets.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.240
I know.

16:29.310 --> 16:30.330
Pretty sweet, aren't they?

16:30.400 --> 16:32.090
They're delicious.

16:35.750 --> 16:37.020
<i># And they just walkin' by #</i>

16:37.090 --> 16:38.780
<i># I think I'm Superfly #</i>

16:38.840 --> 16:40.600
<i># I've got my alibi #</i>

16:40.670 --> 16:42.710
<i># Too easy #</i>

16:42.790 --> 16:44.210
<i># I've got my helmet on #</i>

16:44.290 --> 16:46.170
<i># I think her name is Joan #</i>

16:46.240 --> 16:47.380
<i># I gotta make me #</i>

16:47.460 --> 16:49.870
<i># Halfway paradise #</i>

16:49.950 --> 16:51.360
<i># I'm just an obnoxious boy #</i>

16:51.430 --> 16:53.310
<i># I wanna feel the joy #</i>

16:53.370 --> 16:54.520
<i># I wanna feel the #</i>

16:54.590 --> 16:56.250
<i># Come on, float with me #</i>

16:56.320 --> 16:57.270
<i># I wanna elevate #</i>

16:57.340 --> 16:58.910
You're back.

16:58.970 --> 17:00.150
Is that it?

17:00.220 --> 17:01.880
Do you like them?

17:01.950 --> 17:03.700
They're fine.

17:03.780 --> 17:05.780
Would you ever wear them?

17:05.849 --> 17:08.150
Sure.

17:08.220 --> 17:09.530
Do you ever wear them?

17:09.599 --> 17:13.109
That's gonna be 28.75.
Do you want them or not?

17:15.040 --> 17:17.079
Tired of flirting?

17:18.619 --> 17:20.380
Actually...

17:20.440 --> 17:22.069
I bought them for you.

17:33.880 --> 17:34.900
Hey, I know you.

17:34.970 --> 17:37.270
Where do I know you from?

17:37.340 --> 17:40.340
Freedom Bank.
I'm on the billboards.

17:40.410 --> 17:41.360
No, I know. I know.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.960
You're Sargeant Thompson's brother.

17:43.040 --> 17:45.550
Yeah.
I went to Tate with you guys.

17:45.630 --> 17:47.410
I'm Charlie Sherman.

17:47.480 --> 17:50.450
Oh, man, your brother
was my hero in high school.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.530
Goddamn rocket for an arm.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.160
So how is Sarge, huh?
He still in town?

17:55.230 --> 17:57.710
Yeah. He lives in Ferndale.

17:57.790 --> 17:59.220
Whoa.

17:59.290 --> 18:02.140
Yeah. With his boyfriend.

18:02.200 --> 18:05.240
Paul. He's a great guy.
Teaches math at Tate.

18:07.290 --> 18:08.630
Sugar?

18:13.530 --> 18:14.650
Mark, you seen my brother?

18:14.710 --> 18:16.560
I think he's upstairs.

18:16.630 --> 18:18.320
Thanks.
You got it.

18:20.570 --> 18:22.930
Why don't you just tell him
that you think hunting is wrong?

18:23.000 --> 18:25.370
The man has a stuffed
bear in his bedroom.

18:25.440 --> 18:28.600
You're already his son-in-law.
It doesn't matter if he likes you.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.520
He signs my paychecks.

18:30.580 --> 18:32.340
What is this?

18:32.410 --> 18:34.550
That's the Tate mentor program.

18:34.610 --> 18:35.790
They sent out invitations?

18:35.860 --> 18:37.720
Yeah. They want me
on the board or something.

18:37.790 --> 18:39.340
Been a meeting about it
a couple weeks ago.

18:39.420 --> 18:42.280
Why? Are you joining?

18:42.360 --> 18:46.280
Sanderson roped me into it yesterday.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.400
He didn't tell me
that you were doing it.

18:48.470 --> 18:50.510
Yeah.

18:50.580 --> 18:52.920
Wow.

18:52.990 --> 18:56.330
<i>Join Chip Johnson,
On the Scene, tonight at 6 on 11.</i>

18:58.170 --> 19:00.720
You mind if I borrow
your video camera?

19:36.280 --> 19:37.320
Next one's yours, Bill.

19:38.670 --> 19:41.810
Keep your eyes open this time.
Okay? Don't forget to aim.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.560
This sucks.

19:44.630 --> 19:47.660
I'm fucking wet,
I'm fucking tired.

19:47.740 --> 19:49.220
No to mention deaf.

19:51.980 --> 19:54.440
That thing
sounds like a giant ass.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.100
Shut up.
You'll scare the ducks.

19:59.020 --> 20:00.970
What the fuck?
You closed your eyes.

20:01.050 --> 20:02.390
John, I did not.
I squinted at the sun.

20:02.460 --> 20:05.510
You did, too. What a waste.

20:05.590 --> 20:06.900
Dad...

20:10.190 --> 20:12.500
Get the duck.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.260
I was talking to the dog.

20:19.890 --> 20:22.260
Oh.

20:22.330 --> 20:23.530
I knew that.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.420
I got a little cramp in my back.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.050
Get the duck. Get the duck.

20:35.060 --> 20:36.430
All right, get the damn duck.

21:09.260 --> 21:12.620
If this were a hundred years ago,
your family would be dead of starvation.

21:12.680 --> 21:15.910
Come on, boys. Let's go.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.580
How'd it go?

21:37.640 --> 21:39.170
Uh, fine.

21:39.250 --> 21:40.870
Did you get anything?
Uh, no.

21:40.940 --> 21:42.500
What's in your vest?

21:42.570 --> 21:43.820
Nothing.

21:46.290 --> 21:47.230
It's a duck.

21:47.310 --> 21:48.810
What are you gonna do with it?

21:48.870 --> 21:50.300
Bury it.
Where?

21:50.380 --> 21:52.200
In the backyard.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.480
I think he knows.

22:01.550 --> 22:02.490
He looked really uptight.

22:02.570 --> 22:04.230
He always looks that way.

22:04.300 --> 22:06.270
Everything makes Bill uptight.

22:06.350 --> 22:08.550
Blow jobs make Bill uptight.

22:08.620 --> 22:10.310
Okay, I don't need that visual.

22:10.380 --> 22:12.580
No, I swear.

22:12.650 --> 22:15.140
He has a complex about the little acorn.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.290
No.
Yeah.

22:16.360 --> 22:17.310
The acorn?

22:17.390 --> 22:18.850
I swear to God,
that's what it looks like.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.960
No. No, it doesn't.

22:21.040 --> 22:26.120
It's too bad, too, because I hear
that his brother is huge, like you.

22:34.380 --> 22:35.460
You know what I'm gonna do?

22:35.530 --> 22:38.020
I'm gonna kill her. After I kill him.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.040
Calm down.

22:39.120 --> 22:40.940
<i>Calm down? My wife is screwing
the On the Scene news guy.</i>

22:41.000 --> 22:42.210
You don't know
that was him for sure.

22:42.280 --> 22:45.060
Come on!
The hair, the hair, the hair!

22:45.130 --> 22:46.210
It could've been anyone.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.170
Yeah, anyone. Anyone except me!

22:47.240 --> 22:50.060
Anyone who works out all the time.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.630
God, he's in my bed,
he's in my shirt.

22:54.730 --> 22:56.900
Why aren't you
into blow jobs?

22:56.970 --> 22:59.590
She said I'm not into blow jobs.

22:59.660 --> 23:01.570
Listen to me,
and I want this to be known.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.420
I am. I love blow jobs.

23:04.490 --> 23:07.180
I am Mr. Blow Job Aficionado.

23:07.240 --> 23:08.800
Must run in the family.

23:08.870 --> 23:10.400
Paul, can you stop being
a fag for half a second?

23:10.470 --> 23:12.070
I'll try.

23:12.130 --> 23:13.890
Little acorn.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.110
All right, that's enough.

23:15.170 --> 23:16.700
Oh, my God.

23:16.770 --> 23:19.910
What if she's planning
on leaving me for him?

23:22.280 --> 23:24.990
I'm gonna go get my gun,

23:25.060 --> 23:26.490
and I am gonna go kill him.

23:26.570 --> 23:29.570
Okay, you're not gonna
kill anyone, so just calm down.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.250
I am calm.

23:47.150 --> 23:49.050
Hey, did you bury the duck?

23:50.090 --> 23:52.290
The duck?
The duck is right here.

23:52.350 --> 23:54.010
Quack quack.

23:54.090 --> 23:56.350
Mm-hmm. Look
who's on the scene today.

23:58.180 --> 23:59.300
You spied on me.

23:59.360 --> 24:01.570
That's right, baby,
and I got it all on tape.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.530
That's illegal.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.090
No, smoking pot is illegal.

24:05.160 --> 24:07.040
You cheated on me.

24:07.110 --> 24:09.310
That is a complete
invasion of my privacy.

24:09.380 --> 24:10.720
Are you kidding me?

24:10.790 --> 24:12.030
It was in our bedroom.

24:12.100 --> 24:13.960
I can't believe you would do that to me.

24:14.020 --> 24:16.320
Wait a second. That's what
I'm supposed to be saying to you.

24:16.390 --> 24:17.850
- Give me the tape.
- No.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.810
- I want it.
- No, the tape is mine.

24:19.880 --> 24:20.920
Give me the tape!

24:21.000 --> 24:22.180
No.

24:22.240 --> 24:25.210
<i>Join me later. I'm on the scene
at a local children's hospital,</i>

24:25.280 --> 24:27.040
<i>raising money for a special cause.</i>

24:27.110 --> 24:28.600
We have 30 seconds.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.200
Where is cancer kid?

24:30.270 --> 24:32.540
Over there.
His name's Charlie.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.450
He doesn't look that sick to me.

24:35.530 --> 24:37.410
He's had leukemia since he was 4.

24:37.470 --> 24:39.580
His prognosis is grim.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.490
Tell him to tone down the smile.

24:44.550 --> 24:46.170
- Fine.
- Did my agent call?

24:48.200 --> 24:50.170
On the scene! On the scene!

24:50.240 --> 24:52.580
Always on the scene.
I'll give you on the scene.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.500
Action team. Hey!

24:54.560 --> 24:57.250
I saw you, and I'm watching you!
I'm watching you!

24:57.310 --> 25:01.140
Video camera, one watch.

25:04.040 --> 25:08.670
A wallet, with a Chip Johnson doll.

25:11.110 --> 25:13.890
Can I make my phone call?

25:16.730 --> 25:18.810
Your brother's here.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.080
We watched the tape.

25:23.100 --> 25:26.880
That acorn thing is harsh.

25:26.950 --> 25:28.800
<i>I saw you, and I'm watching you!</i>

25:28.870 --> 25:31.230
Wow, a deranged fan.

25:31.290 --> 25:33.790
Is this the first time something
like this has happened to you?

25:33.850 --> 25:34.960
Yes, it is, Rick.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.250
You see that hair? He dyes it.

25:37.310 --> 25:39.390
It looks like it.

25:39.450 --> 25:41.910
You think he's good-looking?

25:45.440 --> 25:48.670
Why are you watching this?

25:48.740 --> 25:50.080
Do you think he's good-looking?

25:52.640 --> 25:55.710
Bill, he's not better than you.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.640
We have that mentor thing at 7.

26:00.700 --> 26:03.460
Get some sleep.

26:03.510 --> 26:05.940
Deranged fan.

26:11.100 --> 26:12.600
Oh, my God.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.370
All right, give it to me straight.

26:20.450 --> 26:22.330
How many deranged fan jokes?

26:22.400 --> 26:25.660
No one saw anything.
Come on, we're late.

26:27.490 --> 26:29.720
Wait, I'm just gonna take a second.

26:29.790 --> 26:31.290
Sure.

26:48.660 --> 26:50.480
Oh, my God, it's him.

26:50.550 --> 26:51.500
It's the deranged fan!

26:52.700 --> 26:54.130
Deranged fan.

27:27.580 --> 27:29.950
All right.
It's a good-looking group, huh?

27:30.000 --> 27:30.990
Mind if I get this started?

27:31.070 --> 27:34.960
Hey, I, for one, think this is going
to be an excellent program,

27:35.030 --> 27:37.960
but I want to make sure
you think so, too,

27:38.040 --> 27:40.430
so what do you say,
is this gonna be a great program?

27:40.510 --> 27:42.100
Huh?

27:44.220 --> 27:45.740
Yeah-ha-ha!

27:50.580 --> 27:52.790
I cannot believe
you kicked that guy's ass.

27:52.860 --> 27:54.230
Local news usually sucks.

27:54.300 --> 27:55.930
Listen.

27:55.990 --> 28:00.020
Um, no offense, but, um...

28:00.090 --> 28:03.570
I think that you should
maybe choose someone else.

28:03.640 --> 28:06.510
Because this isn't the best time
for me to be mentoring somebody, okay?

28:06.580 --> 28:09.170
What are you talking about?
This is the perfect time.

28:09.240 --> 28:12.620
Why don't you have John Jr.
or Mr. Jacoby mentor you?

28:12.700 --> 28:15.370
Would you want to spend time
with either one of them?

28:16.700 --> 28:19.110
Come on.
Is this about your wife?

28:19.190 --> 28:20.810
No, it's about more
than my wife. It's about...

28:20.890 --> 28:23.990
Don't worry about your wife.
We'll get her back.

28:24.050 --> 28:25.880
We aren't gonna do anything.

28:25.940 --> 28:28.110
Drop it now.

28:28.190 --> 28:30.970
Hi, John. Sarah. John. Donald.

28:31.020 --> 28:32.010
Hey, Choo.

28:32.090 --> 28:34.740
Bill, you're going to make
a schedule for all three kids.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.530
We agreed it would simplify things.

28:36.600 --> 28:39.350
That's right. They'll report to you
at the same time every day.

28:39.420 --> 28:42.000
No way. Bill's my mentor.

28:42.070 --> 28:43.790
This isn't a group project.
All right?

28:43.860 --> 28:46.610
I don't want to be all tied
to you and choo-choo.

28:46.680 --> 28:49.200
Okay? So you can forget about it.

28:49.260 --> 28:51.210
We're fine.
We're not scheduling.

28:51.290 --> 28:52.270
Fine.

28:52.340 --> 28:55.600
All right, Bill.
I'll see you tomorrow after school.

28:55.670 --> 28:57.970
Don't go deadbeat on me.

29:06.190 --> 29:08.980
Gonna be a great program, huh?

29:19.130 --> 29:20.530
Hey.
Hey.

29:20.590 --> 29:22.160
How are you?

29:22.230 --> 29:24.720
I'm good. You want a doughnut?

29:24.790 --> 29:26.210
Can I show you something?

29:28.080 --> 29:29.360
Of course. What's up?

29:29.430 --> 29:30.990
You promise you won't be mad at me?

29:31.060 --> 29:32.040
No.

29:41.140 --> 29:44.480
<i>No, I swear. He's got a complex
about the little acorn.</i>

29:46.070 --> 29:48.070
I thought you should know.

29:50.130 --> 29:51.950
It does not look like an acorn.

29:52.020 --> 29:54.640
Everybody got it in email this morning.

29:54.710 --> 29:57.570
I had Donna delete it from Mr. Jacoby's.

29:57.650 --> 29:58.700
Oh.

29:58.770 --> 30:00.200
He can barely use
the internet anyway.

30:00.270 --> 30:03.620
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

30:13.390 --> 30:15.020
Did my father see it?

30:15.080 --> 30:16.470
No.
John Jr.

30:16.520 --> 30:17.770
Not yet.

30:19.750 --> 30:21.180
Where'd you get that?

30:21.260 --> 30:22.960
Oh, please, I know
where your stash is.

30:25.810 --> 30:28.300
My life is ruined.

30:28.370 --> 30:29.740
Don't exaggerate.

30:29.800 --> 30:32.360
I'm in a sex video. That's porn.

30:34.930 --> 30:36.490
Chip is gonna go into cardiac arrest.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.190
Screw Chip.

30:38.250 --> 30:41.390
He's a celebrity.
This could ruin his career.

30:41.460 --> 30:44.940
<i>On the Scene News 11
doesn't exactly qualify as celebrity.</i>

30:46.830 --> 30:48.900
Stop eating that.
It's not good for you.

30:51.470 --> 30:52.460
Where are you going?

30:52.520 --> 30:54.590
To talk to Chip about your little tape.

31:05.350 --> 31:08.590
<i># Come in close, come in tight #</i>

31:08.650 --> 31:11.650
<i># Taste my neck and take a bite #</i>

31:11.720 --> 31:14.180
<i># Be the vampire saints you are #</i>

31:14.250 --> 31:17.490
<i># Stab it right into my heart #</i>

31:17.550 --> 31:19.140
<i># Cut my skin upon your teeth #</i>

31:19.210 --> 31:21.800
Bill, what are you doing?

31:21.870 --> 31:24.680
Put the gun down!
Hey, news guy!

31:26.890 --> 31:29.650
We're on the scene. It's your house!

31:29.700 --> 31:30.820
Bill, you're gonna get arrested!

31:30.890 --> 31:33.130
Won't be the first time.

31:34.770 --> 31:36.620
Bill, you go home!

31:36.680 --> 31:38.310
This is not about you!

31:40.620 --> 31:42.410
Get...

31:44.040 --> 31:46.050
Yeah, let's see what Chip
has to say for himself.

31:47.530 --> 31:49.380
I don't know why you're blaming Chip
for your tape.

31:49.450 --> 31:50.970
How long you been lying to me?

31:51.050 --> 31:52.130
Oh, please. What about you?

31:52.200 --> 31:53.700
I never lied to you.
Really?

31:53.770 --> 31:54.890
Yeah.
Oh.

31:54.950 --> 31:57.000
Well, you've never managed to clip
a feather, let alone bring home a duck,

31:57.060 --> 31:59.080
but you just hit two 4-inch targets
from 30 yards.

31:59.140 --> 32:00.260
Who's the liar?

32:00.330 --> 32:02.500
What the hell's going on out here?

32:02.570 --> 32:04.510
It's me.
I can see that.

32:04.580 --> 32:06.660
I filed a restraining order
against you.

32:06.730 --> 32:08.250
Well, then, congratulations.

32:08.330 --> 32:10.220
Looks like you got
your top story for tonight.

32:10.280 --> 32:12.030
This is not gonna look good.

32:12.110 --> 32:13.510
I don't care how it looks.

32:13.580 --> 32:16.610
I can't be involved in this.
Take your husband and leave.

32:16.680 --> 32:19.260
Don't speak to me like I'm
some groupie you just fucked.

32:19.340 --> 32:21.700
Honey!
I just want you off my property.

32:21.770 --> 32:23.900
- Give me that towel!
- Get your hands off me!

32:23.970 --> 32:25.380
I knew you dyed your hair!

32:25.450 --> 32:27.040
Bill, cut it out!
Apologize to her!

32:27.110 --> 32:28.930
Bill!
You are gonna get arrested!

32:29.000 --> 32:30.460
Let me see that hair!

32:30.530 --> 32:33.320
Chip Johnson, Action News!

32:33.380 --> 32:35.680
- Phony, apologize!
- Mm-mm.

32:35.750 --> 32:38.140
<i>You apologize! Apologize!</i>

32:38.210 --> 32:41.030
Jesus Christ.

32:41.100 --> 32:44.060
<i>Your brother's here, Acorn.</i>

32:50.600 --> 32:51.650
Good morning.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.540
Good morning.

32:57.450 --> 32:59.360
Hey, you want to come swim?

32:59.430 --> 33:01.850
The pool's open before school.

33:01.930 --> 33:03.590
Friends and family are welcome.

33:03.650 --> 33:05.510
It's 5:00 in the morning.

33:05.570 --> 33:08.710
So? You going back to sleep?

33:10.570 --> 33:13.190
Sergeant says you swim every day.

33:13.250 --> 33:16.150
Don't you remember
how liberating it feels to be in the water?

33:18.090 --> 33:19.750
The best way to drown out the noise.

33:22.210 --> 33:24.580
Come on.

33:24.650 --> 33:26.980
Who needs an occasional escape
from their reality?

33:27.040 --> 33:29.630
I'll grab you a suit.

33:32.740 --> 33:34.430
You ready?

33:45.540 --> 33:48.850
All right. Come on, big guy.
Let's rock it.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.290
I know how this entire debacle
must look,

34:50.370 --> 34:53.630
and I'm sorry if I have
embarrassed you in any way.

34:53.699 --> 34:56.860
Bill, you're dangerously close
to losing everything you've worked for.

34:56.929 --> 34:58.210
I understand that.

34:58.270 --> 35:01.470
Pull it together and resolve your personal
problems in private like a gentleman.

35:01.530 --> 35:04.190
- Yes, sir.
- We're having a family dinner tomorrow.

35:04.260 --> 35:06.560
I'll expect the two of you
to be there, together.

35:06.630 --> 35:08.790
- She has a restraining order.
- Work it out.

35:08.860 --> 35:10.610
We'll be there together.

35:33.790 --> 35:34.960
- Hey!
- Hey!

35:35.040 --> 35:36.210
How are you?

35:36.290 --> 35:39.250
Actually, I think this is the best one.
The location is perfect.

35:39.330 --> 35:41.220
Yeah, the traffic pattern's great.

35:41.270 --> 35:42.870
Oh, and you can do a drive-through.

35:42.940 --> 35:44.790
That's a great idea.

35:44.860 --> 35:46.230
Hey, apologize!

35:46.300 --> 35:48.410
Apologize!

35:49.660 --> 35:51.090
Sorry!

35:53.690 --> 35:55.120
That was strange.

35:55.200 --> 35:58.570
Yeah. Anyway...
You know, that's the space.

36:00.030 --> 36:02.040
Oh, when do we get to meet Jessica?

36:04.510 --> 36:06.010
Uh, Jessica?

36:06.070 --> 36:08.370
Well, actually, she, uh...

36:08.440 --> 36:12.020
she just called me. She's sick.
She has the flu, and it's pretty bad.

36:12.100 --> 36:14.330
But you'll meet her when we
come up to spend the day with you.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.370
Right.

36:16.440 --> 36:18.960
Well, we got some time to kill.
Maybe we can see your offices.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.630
I would love to see your operation.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.670
<i>I read about it
in Entrepreneur Magazine.</i>

36:22.750 --> 36:25.230
Your father-in-law sounds
like a pretty amazing fellow.

36:25.310 --> 36:27.220
Good idea, Jim.

36:28.190 --> 36:30.120
Yeah, Jim, that's a great idea.

36:30.200 --> 36:33.780
Um, yeah. Yeah, sure.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.730
Take your time. Take your time.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.010
Come on, Jim.

36:41.090 --> 36:42.640
Come on in.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.620
- Just come on...
- You're really fast.

36:45.590 --> 36:46.770
Hey, Bill.

36:48.150 --> 36:50.430
Um...

36:50.490 --> 36:52.340
This is Jim and, uh, Jane.

36:52.410 --> 36:54.320
This is my student I'm mentoring.

36:54.400 --> 36:56.280
It's an alumni-participation program.

36:56.340 --> 36:57.970
That's fantastic.
Nice.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.890
We love our family
being part of the community.

37:00.920 --> 37:02.640
You guys are family?

37:02.710 --> 37:06.160
Well, hopefully, when Bill becomes part
of SweetSweet, it'll feel that way.

37:06.230 --> 37:07.180
Doughnuts?

37:09.270 --> 37:11.570
I love the chocolate-covered ones
with the vanilla.

37:11.640 --> 37:14.940
Oh, you should visit our Madison store
when Bill and Jessica come next week.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.380
I'd love to.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.540
Just... Just... Just a second.
Excuse me.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.360
Sarah, I'm really busy right now.

37:30.430 --> 37:32.280
Donald told me
you went hunting last weekend.

37:32.340 --> 37:34.230
Why was I intentionally excluded?

37:34.290 --> 37:36.810
- What, you wanna kill little birds?
- It's discriminatory.

37:36.890 --> 37:40.050
Let me tell you something.
Life is discriminatory. Deal with it.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.310
So is this where the tour starts?

37:50.390 --> 37:52.460
They don't give tours here.
It's against the rules.

37:52.530 --> 37:54.260
Oh.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.910
Well, we don't want anyone
to break the rules.

37:56.980 --> 37:58.840
Be quiet.

38:01.690 --> 38:03.150
Doughnuts?

38:03.220 --> 38:04.980
I have to go back to work now.

38:05.040 --> 38:07.250
We're supposed to spend
five hours a week together.

38:07.320 --> 38:09.480
I'll call you.

38:25.710 --> 38:27.660
What are you doing?

38:27.730 --> 38:29.330
I'm fixing your head!

38:29.390 --> 38:31.340
No, no, no!
You come down from there!

38:31.410 --> 38:33.420
You own this place!

38:33.490 --> 38:35.630
You can't have your face all saggy!

38:35.690 --> 38:37.390
I'll get somebody to fix it in the morning!

38:38.350 --> 38:41.390
Come on! Get down!

38:43.760 --> 38:45.350
We'll go do something!

38:49.110 --> 38:51.020
What exactly do you want
from this mentor thing?

38:51.090 --> 38:53.430
An A.

38:53.490 --> 38:56.070
Hey, there.
You guys need anything?

38:56.150 --> 38:57.970
Uh, no, thank you.

38:58.030 --> 39:00.780
Actually, uh, we do need something.
He needs a suit.

39:00.850 --> 39:03.750
And, uh, you got anything
besides these lame plum smugglers?

39:05.520 --> 39:07.380
I'll see what I can do.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.560
How are you ever gonna meet
any new chicks if you don't work it?

39:11.640 --> 39:13.600
For your information,
I'm still married.

39:13.680 --> 39:17.320
The only way to get the old one back
is to get a new one she's jealous of.

39:17.390 --> 39:18.570
Yeah, when you're 15.

39:19.950 --> 39:22.160
These are cool.
A lot of guys are wearing these.

39:22.220 --> 39:24.070
Yeah, those are cool.

39:24.140 --> 39:25.730
Do you like to swim?

39:25.810 --> 39:28.360
Yeah. Yeah, I like to swim.

39:28.430 --> 39:29.810
You should come sometime.

39:29.870 --> 39:31.760
It's great exercise,

39:31.820 --> 39:34.580
and, you know, we can get breakfast
or something afterwards.

39:34.640 --> 39:37.770
Well, look, you guys decide you want
any of that stuff, my name's Laura.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.630
Just give my name at the register.

39:39.700 --> 39:41.960
All right.
Thank you, Laura.

39:43.920 --> 39:46.510
My brother owns this place,
so try and behave.

39:46.570 --> 39:48.680
Wait. Wait. Uh...

39:48.750 --> 39:51.780
"This is going to be a great program" guy
is your brother?

39:54.230 --> 39:57.530
You own a bank. He owns this place.
Can I get the family discount?

39:57.610 --> 39:59.520
- Let's play it by ear.
- This is a great program.

39:59.600 --> 40:02.910
Hey, deranged fan guy. Apologize!

40:09.390 --> 40:11.770
- Bird watching?
- Duck hunting.

40:15.120 --> 40:18.560
No one can even tell
it's you in the video.

40:18.640 --> 40:21.380
And, besides, you're more popular now
than ever before.

40:21.450 --> 40:26.730
I mean, everybody loves the whole
"deranged fan, apologize" thing.

40:26.790 --> 40:28.830
I'm glad you're amused.

40:28.910 --> 40:30.940
What do you think would happen
to Brian Williams' career

40:31.020 --> 40:32.930
if he were caught on tape
with someone else's wife?

40:33.010 --> 40:34.210
Who the hell's that?

40:34.280 --> 40:35.370
Never mind.

40:35.430 --> 40:38.950
The point is,
it would be O-V-E-R.

40:39.020 --> 40:42.570
Don't be dramatic, all right?
Look at Paris Hilton.

40:42.630 --> 40:44.320
Clinton, for that matter.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.070
This could be the thing
that gets you a national spot.

40:47.150 --> 40:49.000
I don't know.

40:50.480 --> 40:52.390
Maybe I should hire my own PR person.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.620
Don't you have to go to work?

40:55.690 --> 40:57.510
Yeah. I gotta go.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.480
See ya.

41:06.450 --> 41:07.720
Hello.

41:07.790 --> 41:10.750
Hey, it's me.

41:10.830 --> 41:12.860
Oh. What's up?

41:12.940 --> 41:15.360
<i>Uh, I just, uh...</i>

41:15.430 --> 41:18.340
I just want to know if you want me
to pick you up for dinner tomorrow night.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.560
Yeah, that's fine.

41:25.580 --> 41:27.040
What's that noise?

41:27.110 --> 41:30.250
Oh, it's, uh...
Sergeant's watching TV.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.870
Oh. How is Sarge?

41:31.950 --> 41:34.630
Uh, he's good. You know...
You know him. He's always happy.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.390
That's true.

41:36.450 --> 41:39.010
<i>Tell him I said hi.
I gotta stop by the store.</i>

41:39.080 --> 41:41.320
My dad said it's, like, totally amazing.

41:41.380 --> 41:43.270
Oh, gross.

41:43.340 --> 41:45.280
Come on.
You have a great ass.

41:45.350 --> 41:46.560
What?

41:47.650 --> 41:48.830
Nothing. I was just...

41:48.900 --> 41:51.620
I was just, uh, thinking
how great your body is.

41:51.690 --> 41:53.540
You were thinking about my butt?

41:53.610 --> 41:55.200
It's just when you said gross...

41:55.270 --> 41:57.920
Oh, so I said gross,
and you thought of my butt.

41:57.990 --> 42:00.890
<i>No. That's what you say
when you check it out sometimes.</i>

42:05.060 --> 42:08.610
<i>Bill, I can see you.</i>

42:08.670 --> 42:11.550
What the hell are you doing?

42:11.620 --> 42:14.070
I need some clothes.

42:16.070 --> 42:18.520
Jesus Christ, Bill.

42:18.600 --> 42:21.380
I'm sorry.

42:21.450 --> 42:24.640
I just don't understand
what you see in that guy.

42:29.830 --> 42:31.590
Stop spying on me.

42:36.990 --> 42:39.330
I'll pick you up at 7 tomorrow night.

42:39.400 --> 42:41.790
Tell your little friend I saw him.

43:03.200 --> 43:07.360
The most important thing is that
you treat tomorrow like a first date.

43:07.420 --> 43:10.940
All right? You gotta buy some new clothes,
and you're gonna bring her flowers.

43:11.010 --> 43:12.530
It's gonna make her feel
like you really care.

43:12.610 --> 43:15.870
- What's going on?
- We're upgrading the package.

44:05.470 --> 44:06.900
Ahh!

44:09.220 --> 44:11.040
What are you doing here?

44:12.100 --> 44:14.100
Taking a shower.

44:14.180 --> 44:16.570
Does this count as part
of the five hours per week?

44:18.910 --> 44:21.250
Would you write me a note
so I don't get detention for being late?

44:23.900 --> 44:25.220
No.

44:27.390 --> 44:29.910
Hey. I guess I'll see you
after school.

44:29.980 --> 44:31.830
I won't be there.

44:31.900 --> 44:34.330
I have to buy some new clothes.
Sorry.

44:34.400 --> 44:36.410
Cool. We'll go to the mall.

44:37.570 --> 44:39.420
- Hey, Mr. Rose.
- Aren't you late for class?

44:39.480 --> 44:42.130
Bill's signing a note for me.

44:42.210 --> 44:43.930
Oh, really?

44:44.000 --> 44:47.610
Um, well, that's not exactly
how it works.

44:53.820 --> 44:55.920
You're really lucky
I don't report you.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.390
- Come on. He's my mentor.
- Look, move it.

44:58.460 --> 45:00.310
All right. Bill, I'll see you later.

45:00.380 --> 45:02.550
Tuck in the shirt.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.100
She's hot.

46:13.180 --> 46:15.510
I'm shopping for clothes.

46:15.580 --> 46:17.780
You need a new strategy. Y...

46:17.850 --> 46:19.700
If your wife saw you with her,
she'd think twice

46:19.770 --> 46:21.360
<i>about hitting
the On the Scene news guy again.</i>

46:21.430 --> 46:23.290
Let's say that I buy into your theory.

46:23.350 --> 46:25.200
Who am I gonna
go out on a date with?

46:25.270 --> 46:28.180
Unlike you, I have a plan.
You can borrow my girlfriend.

46:28.240 --> 46:30.550
Oh, right.

46:33.720 --> 46:35.470
Look at him.

46:36.600 --> 46:38.770
He needs your help.

46:41.210 --> 46:43.860
He needs new clothes and a hot chick
to get his wife back.

46:43.920 --> 46:45.580
I wonder who thought of that.

46:45.660 --> 46:48.550
Come on. What?
I'll pay you a hundred bucks.

46:48.630 --> 46:50.250
Where'd you get a hundred bucks?

46:50.330 --> 46:51.880
I happen to have an allowance.

46:51.960 --> 46:54.130
Fine.

46:54.190 --> 46:56.500
I'll get him some clothes.

47:00.600 --> 47:02.580
<i>So that On the Scene loser's
jammin' his wife,</i>

47:02.640 --> 47:04.460
but he's got a date with her tonight.

47:04.530 --> 47:08.180
Yeah, I saw the video.
What's up with his hair?

47:08.240 --> 47:09.770
You... I can hear you.

47:09.840 --> 47:11.640
You know,
I sold her those underwear.

47:11.700 --> 47:14.900
- That's hot.
- I'll bet you it was his fault.

47:14.970 --> 47:16.820
It's not my fault.
Oh, really?

47:16.880 --> 47:18.610
When was the last pair of panties
you bought her?

47:19.860 --> 47:21.750
I'm a fat fuck.

47:21.810 --> 47:23.720
I love panties.

47:23.800 --> 47:25.960
I bet you don't even know
what kind she wears.

47:26.030 --> 47:28.050
I see it every day...

47:28.110 --> 47:30.390
women
investing hope in underwear.

47:30.450 --> 47:32.300
I bought you those pink furry ones.

47:32.370 --> 47:35.670
- I returned them.
- I would never forget how sexy you are.

47:35.730 --> 47:37.420
You know, you're kind of creepy.

47:37.490 --> 47:40.180
- But only kind of. Right? Hey.
- Stop.

47:46.540 --> 47:49.100
That is hot.

47:53.100 --> 47:54.730
Thanks for helping out.

47:54.800 --> 47:56.810
I needed the money.

47:56.880 --> 48:00.390
You know, this would look
really hot on you.

48:00.470 --> 48:02.440
I'm not trying on underwear for you.

48:02.510 --> 48:04.270
What's your hang-up
with underwear?

48:04.330 --> 48:06.410
I mean, it's just like
wearing a bathing suit.

48:06.480 --> 48:09.960
Oh, really? Well, then,
why don't you model some for me?

48:12.110 --> 48:15.980
I'll model for you, you come on
a date with me Friday night.

48:18.290 --> 48:20.360
I get to choose the underwear.

48:20.440 --> 48:22.510
All right.
Let's go.

48:39.980 --> 48:41.260
Bill.

48:41.330 --> 48:43.720
It's no big deal.

48:49.330 --> 48:51.180
You ready to face my dad?

48:52.140 --> 48:55.210
I face him every day. It'll be fine.

48:55.280 --> 48:57.180
I'll pretend I'm sick,
and we'll leave early.

49:01.130 --> 49:02.590
You ready?

49:02.670 --> 49:05.160
The question is are you ready?

49:05.230 --> 49:06.790
Yep.

49:06.860 --> 49:09.290
I don't know.
I don't think you can handle this.

49:09.350 --> 49:11.210
I think it might be
a little too sexy for you.

49:11.280 --> 49:12.900
Let's see it, kid.

49:12.980 --> 49:14.250
All right.

49:16.500 --> 49:18.800
<i># Hey #</i>

49:18.860 --> 49:20.970
<i># Everybody get naked #</i>

49:24.500 --> 49:26.050
<i># Shake it, shake it, shake it #</i>

49:26.130 --> 49:28.990
Oh, yeah! Ride the pony.

49:30.670 --> 49:32.680
<i># Shake it, shake it, shake it #</i>

49:32.750 --> 49:34.920
You know you want it. You know it.

49:36.810 --> 49:38.280
Tap it! Tap it!

49:38.350 --> 49:40.810
<i># Mercy, shake it, shake it, shake it #</i>

49:40.870 --> 49:42.700
You're so weird.

49:42.760 --> 49:45.830
<i># I love you #</i>

49:45.900 --> 49:47.590
Ride the pony!

49:47.650 --> 49:51.620
<i># Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah #</i>

49:52.910 --> 49:54.910
Duck is perfect, Mom.

49:54.990 --> 49:57.770
My favorite is the acorn squash.

49:59.310 --> 50:00.970
It's in season now.

50:02.470 --> 50:04.420
It's nice.

50:04.490 --> 50:05.640
Oh-oh-oh-oh.

50:07.920 --> 50:10.570
I missed that one.

50:10.630 --> 50:12.160
It's good luck.

50:12.230 --> 50:14.850
- You have to swallow it.
- That's right. Swallow it.

50:18.630 --> 50:20.610
It's all yours.

50:21.830 --> 50:23.740
You can't disrespect the hunt.

50:28.040 --> 50:29.860
Swallow it.

50:30.920 --> 50:31.970
No.

50:33.450 --> 50:34.400
Yes.

50:35.720 --> 50:36.670
No.

50:36.750 --> 50:38.820
Swallow it!

50:38.880 --> 50:40.930
No!
Swallow it.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.240
No!
Swallow it.

50:43.300 --> 50:44.580
No.
Eat it!

50:44.650 --> 50:46.950
- No!
- Swallow it, you ingrate!

50:47.020 --> 50:49.180
John, please! We're at the dinner table.

50:49.260 --> 50:53.280
I'm sorry, okay?
But he has absolutely no respect

50:53.350 --> 50:55.520
for this family
and everything we've done for him.

50:55.590 --> 50:58.460
I mean, he wouldn't even have a job
if it weren't for you!

50:58.530 --> 51:00.810
He's executive vice president.

51:00.870 --> 51:03.330
Executive vice president? Of what?

51:03.400 --> 51:05.150
Human resources?

51:05.230 --> 51:08.290
A position that we created
specifically for him!

51:08.360 --> 51:10.050
Shut up, John!

51:10.120 --> 51:13.940
Since Bill's been at the bank,
unemployment claims are down 41%.

51:14.020 --> 51:17.210
That's because he never fires anyone!

51:17.280 --> 51:19.900
And why are you defending him?

51:21.800 --> 51:24.130
Pathetic. Unbelievable.

51:24.200 --> 51:26.400
If you were my wife, I would leave you.

51:26.470 --> 51:28.890
No one is leaving.

51:28.960 --> 51:30.780
No one's leaving.

51:30.850 --> 51:33.470
No one is leaving anyone.

51:34.440 --> 51:36.290
I'm running for mayor.

51:36.360 --> 51:37.850
What?

51:37.930 --> 51:39.810
I'm announcing it at the club picnic,

51:39.880 --> 51:43.970
and I expect all of you
to behave like a family.

51:45.410 --> 51:48.790
Now, does everyone understand
what I'm saying? Jessica?

51:48.870 --> 51:50.490
Yes, Daddy.

51:50.570 --> 51:52.870
Now, who wants to get the fireworks?

51:54.150 --> 51:55.900
I'll get them.

51:57.660 --> 52:00.230
Just don't screw it up.

52:00.290 --> 52:02.810
You know, when my dad
finds out you made a tape,

52:02.880 --> 52:06.140
and it's on the internet,
he's gonna freak.

52:06.210 --> 52:08.100
Well, maybe he won't find out.

52:08.170 --> 52:09.920
He's running for mayor.

52:09.990 --> 52:12.060
Mm-hmm. And I told you.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.760
Let's get coffee.

52:17.820 --> 52:19.840
No. No, I'm too stressed.

52:19.900 --> 52:23.110
Come on.
It'll be a good distraction.

52:23.170 --> 52:24.830
Yeah, all right.

52:25.790 --> 52:27.650
It's gonna be okay. Come on.

52:27.710 --> 52:31.460
What happened to the girl who didn't
give a shit about what anybody thought?

52:31.530 --> 52:35.300
Where is the Jess who used to go
commando under her uniform

52:35.360 --> 52:37.210
and flash me outside of science class,

52:37.280 --> 52:40.210
even though Jenny Bradley
called her a slut?

52:40.290 --> 52:42.360
And Jenny Bradley was a slut!

52:42.430 --> 52:44.160
Bill?

52:44.220 --> 52:46.290
Hey!
Hey!

52:46.370 --> 52:47.870
What the heck are you doing here?

52:47.930 --> 52:50.520
Um, just, you know,
having a little late-night coffee.

52:50.590 --> 52:51.700
Really?

52:58.780 --> 53:00.890
So you coming by the store tomorrow?

53:00.960 --> 53:04.820
Uh, maybe tomorrow night after work.

53:04.900 --> 53:06.270
Yeah?

53:06.340 --> 53:08.270
Make sure you ask for me.

53:08.350 --> 53:09.670
Lucy.

53:09.730 --> 53:11.160
Yeah, exactly.

53:11.230 --> 53:13.500
So I'll see you then.

53:17.310 --> 53:20.440
- Lucy works at the mall, doesn't she?
- Mm-hmm.

53:20.510 --> 53:22.610
You know what I
could really go for right now?

53:22.690 --> 53:23.960
A doughnut.

53:24.920 --> 53:26.210
What?

53:26.270 --> 53:28.440
Fresh out of the oven.
Milk-chocolate icing.

53:28.510 --> 53:30.580
Think how successful Krispy Kreme is.

53:30.660 --> 53:32.480
Yeah. They are.

53:32.550 --> 53:34.880
If we had one of those, we would never
have to worry about your father again.

53:34.940 --> 53:36.370
What are you talking about?

53:36.450 --> 53:38.430
Doughnut franchises
are extremely lucrative.

53:38.490 --> 53:41.310
Yeah, but who the hell
wants a doughnut franchise?

53:41.370 --> 53:43.800
Who the hell
wants a doughnut franchise?

53:46.300 --> 53:51.490
Bill, listen, you gotta do
something about the tape.

53:51.550 --> 53:54.330
What can I do?

53:54.400 --> 53:57.300
Seven million teens
have probably already downloaded it.

53:57.370 --> 53:58.800
Oh, God.

53:59.990 --> 54:02.240
I feel sick.

54:05.080 --> 54:06.990
I don't know what he's doing here.

54:09.780 --> 54:11.640
It's okay. Go on.

54:11.710 --> 54:13.590
Go on. I understand.

54:13.660 --> 54:16.760
I don't think I can handle another
"deranged fan" with him anyway.

54:19.230 --> 54:20.980
Are you seeing that girl?

54:21.050 --> 54:23.220
I told you, I just met her.

54:24.380 --> 54:26.520
She obviously likes you.

54:29.050 --> 54:30.910
Do you like her?

54:33.760 --> 54:36.150
She sells underwear.
She's nice.

54:47.740 --> 54:49.770
Okay.
Okay. Bye.

55:05.850 --> 55:07.920
What are you doing?

55:07.990 --> 55:09.590
Pretty good, huh?

55:09.650 --> 55:11.630
This isn't a competition, Bill.

55:12.830 --> 55:14.170
Okay.

55:14.240 --> 55:16.430
Oh, I gotta stop smoking that chronic.

55:18.740 --> 55:20.880
Nice mentoring, Bill!

55:22.430 --> 55:25.100
Roser the poser looks pissed.

55:26.100 --> 55:29.100
He probably couldn't punch out
his algorithm this morning.

55:31.830 --> 55:34.480
Was she jealous?

55:34.550 --> 55:36.440
Yeah, she was.

55:36.500 --> 55:38.890
I knew it. I knew it.

55:38.970 --> 55:40.910
It's only a matter of time now.

55:44.530 --> 55:46.990
- Is she coming to see the SweetSweets?
- I don't think so.

55:47.060 --> 55:49.610
Yes, she is.

55:51.420 --> 55:53.750
It's never gonna work.
Of course it is.

55:58.840 --> 56:00.980
This is my wife.

56:01.050 --> 56:02.900
Nice to meet you.

56:02.960 --> 56:04.560
Likewise.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.760
All righty, then.

56:07.830 --> 56:09.840
Let's get started.

56:09.910 --> 56:12.630
And now we put
the topping on them.

56:12.700 --> 56:15.280
We got glazed,
chocolate, and sprinkles.

56:15.350 --> 56:16.780
What the hell are you doing?

56:16.850 --> 56:18.890
I'm sorry. It looked so good.

56:18.970 --> 56:20.560
Hey, Lucy tried it, too.

56:20.630 --> 56:24.040
- Who's Lucy?
- I don't know.

56:24.120 --> 56:27.150
He has an imaginary friend... Lucy.

56:28.690 --> 56:31.080
Well, we're gonna have
to throw all that away now.

56:31.160 --> 56:32.980
I'll just take it home.

56:33.050 --> 56:35.210
- No. That's against company policy.
- What?

56:35.280 --> 56:38.220
- Frosting can't leave the building?
- It's a secret recipe.

56:39.730 --> 56:42.190
All right. If you're gonna
throw it away, here. Try it.

56:42.260 --> 56:43.850
It's good.

56:49.170 --> 56:50.480
Ahh.

56:51.920 --> 56:54.540
I'm not eating sugar right now.

56:56.560 --> 56:58.540
I'll take you guys over
to the boxing section,

56:58.610 --> 57:00.550
and then, uh,
set you up at the register.

57:03.480 --> 57:07.370
I'll have six chocolate
and two vanilla and three cherry.

57:07.450 --> 57:10.380
No, make that two chocolate.

57:10.450 --> 57:13.170
She looks a little young
to be his wife.

57:13.240 --> 57:15.270
Jane, who gives a shit,
all right?

57:15.350 --> 57:17.200
We need to move
some of these franchises.

57:17.270 --> 57:19.120
He could be a huge asset to us.

57:19.180 --> 57:21.090
Don't cuss at me.

57:21.170 --> 57:23.500
I am trying to protect
your interest also.

57:23.570 --> 57:25.160
I'm sorry.

57:26.450 --> 57:29.710
I just think sometimes
you have unreasonable expectations.

57:30.890 --> 57:32.520
There you go.

57:32.590 --> 57:34.410
Actually, I said six chocolate.

57:34.480 --> 57:36.660
Maybe you should consider
laying off the chocolate.

57:37.970 --> 57:41.100
Hey. He's just kidding.
He wants the chocolate ones for himself.

57:41.160 --> 57:43.890
Okay, so that will be, uh, 8.63, please.

57:43.950 --> 57:45.740
I already gave you a coupon
for the free dozen.

57:45.800 --> 57:47.980
Dude, the last thing you need
is the free dozen.

57:51.350 --> 57:54.220
There you go.
There's your change.

57:56.210 --> 57:58.310
Have a SweetSweet day.

57:58.390 --> 58:01.450
Bill, why do you want a doughnut store?
This place sucks.

58:01.520 --> 58:03.560
Let me tell you something, kid.

58:03.630 --> 58:05.420
Working sucks, okay?

58:05.480 --> 58:07.390
Working sucks!

58:07.470 --> 58:11.500
It doesn't matter if you're in a bank,
a department store, or a doughnut factory,

58:11.560 --> 58:13.670
because once you've been there long enough,
the only thing you'll care about

58:13.740 --> 58:16.590
is when your next pay increase is,
how many vacation days you've accrued,

58:16.660 --> 58:19.040
and if your health insurance is gonna pay
for the cholesterol medicine

58:19.120 --> 58:21.700
that keeps your heart pumping no matter
how much shit you work through it.

58:21.780 --> 58:25.770
Then, after you've gained 20 or 30 pounds
because you're so fucking uptight all the time,

58:25.830 --> 58:28.680
you wake up and discover
that you're working for your father-in-law

58:28.750 --> 58:31.620
in a position with a gratuitous title,
and you're totally replaceable.

58:31.690 --> 58:34.150
And not only is the new guy
better at your job,

58:34.220 --> 58:36.780
but he's got a better car
and better jokes and better hair!

58:36.840 --> 58:38.340
So no matter what you do,

58:38.410 --> 58:40.900
you make sure you make
a lot of money doing it,

58:40.980 --> 58:42.690
because it all sucks!

58:44.210 --> 58:47.620
And that is one lesson I,
as your mentor, can teach you.

58:47.690 --> 58:49.290
Whoa.

58:51.300 --> 58:53.380
How are you?
Step right on up here.

58:53.450 --> 58:56.450
What would you like today, my little friend?
A glazed doughnut?

58:56.520 --> 58:58.730
Well, if you have any questions,
you can call us at home.

58:58.790 --> 58:59.740
Okay.

58:59.820 --> 59:01.860
Otherwise, we'll send down the paperwork
on Monday. Congratulations.

59:01.930 --> 59:03.970
- Okay.
- Hey, Lucy has to be home by 6.

59:04.040 --> 59:06.530
Who's Lucy?
His imaginary friend.

59:06.600 --> 59:09.760
- All right, then. We'll talk Monday.
- All right.

59:09.830 --> 59:11.420
Take care.

59:15.400 --> 59:17.380
Bye.

59:25.870 --> 59:28.230
So are these for, like,
baby announcements?

59:35.850 --> 59:37.340
Aah!

59:37.420 --> 59:40.260
You think that's funny?

59:40.330 --> 59:42.700
Come on. Bring them on.

59:42.760 --> 59:44.290
Oh, yeah?

59:44.360 --> 59:46.690
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

59:46.760 --> 59:48.190
Come on!

59:49.610 --> 59:50.860
No guts!

59:54.950 --> 59:57.340
Look at my little friend.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.350
Damn, my thumb!
I lost my thumb!

01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:04.420
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Where's your thumb?

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:07.800
Where's your thumb?
Lucy, you guys, help him find his thumb!

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.250
You guys, where is his thumb?

01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:13.600
It's just ketchup.

01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:15.080
You're dead.

01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:17.380
Oh! Oh, my God! No!

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.840
<i># Let it loose #</i>

01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:26.370
<i># Let it loose #</i>

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:29.280
<i># It's modern man #</i>

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:32.480
Okay, so, uh,
let's take two of those boxes,

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:33.950
five of the Froggers,

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.550
two of the big fountains,

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:39.970
a couple dozen of those, uh,
crackers, and, uh, some rockets.

01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:42.340
That'll be good.
Do you have a bathroom here?

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.440
- Uh, yeah, it's in the back.
- Okay.

01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:47.800
Uh, you know what?

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:49.950
Double that.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.990
Dude, you want insane?

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.730
Try the Crack Pipe

01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:59.450
and the k-k-k-k-k-k... yaah...

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.470
Hyper Coaster.

01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:01.530
Right on.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.160
You know what?

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.310
Pack those together
so he won't know.

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:09.370
I'm excited.
You excited? Get excited.

01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:10.900
I'm excited.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.910
I think you have a thing
for Miss SweetSweet.

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:16.500
I do?
Yeah. I don't know.

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.080
It seemed like...
She hates me.

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:19.430
I don't know.
She was so...

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.090
- Seemed like she was kind of into you.
- She's insane.

01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:22.950
Oh, really?
Tasting her chocolate.

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.540
That was hysterical.

01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:26.430
You know what?
Thanks for coming along.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.910
No problem. You know, I, uh...
I actually had a pretty good time.

01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:31.810
What can I say? I'm fun.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.500
I am.

01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:40.440
Congratulations, man.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:44.640
Yeah? Well, I still have to convince Jess
to buy into a doughnut franchise.

01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:48.930
You already did all the work.
Just tell her how much cash she makes.

01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:50.750
All she has to do
is sign a piece of paper.

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:53.910
Jess doesn't do anything
without her father's permission.

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:55.640
She sounds lame, man.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.020
Give that to me.

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:23.520
<i># Young and useless #</i>

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:26.390

Laura, can we climb your wall?

<i># And I feel #</i>

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:52.100

01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:56.860
Hey, Bill, apologize!

01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:58.870
Apologize!

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:07.040
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh!

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:09.400
What are you, high?

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:13.370
Would you get down?
Bring 'em down.

01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:17.520
What are you, high?

01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:22.550
Hey, "This is going to be
a great program" guy.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:32.150
<i># Everything's all right #</i>

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.670
I just scored on myself.

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:38.190
Watch this. Watch this one.
Laura, watch closely.

01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:39.860
Hey, Paul, you wanna play?

01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:42.680
Come on. We'll kick your ass.

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:45.600
Oh, Jesus. Everything has to be
a competition with you, doesn't it?

01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:47.990
Oh! We're just having fun.

01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:50.870
I'm serious.
That's why Chip Johnson

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:53.110
and the whole acorn thing
drive you so crazy.

01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:56.120
Take it easy, Rose Man.

01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:58.550
It's just air hockey, okay, Paul?

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:01.430
Really? Well, it's in the pool as well.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.210
Just take him home.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.540
Take him home.
To his house or to our house?

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:09.100
Okay, don't start, okay?

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.480
Sergeant, forget it.

01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:13.520
Please, I can take a hint.

01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:15.500
Roser the poser
can't handle a competition.

01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:17.590
Bill...

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:19.340
No, really.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:21.400
I don't need to live with you guys.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.440
Come on.

01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:32.690
- I don't know why you said that.
- Can't you see that's his problem?

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.540
His life is falling apart.
Where's your sympathy?

01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:37.520
You always take his side.

01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:41.040
He's my brother. For obvious reasons,
he's having an identity crisis.

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:43.380
Remember what that feels like?

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.110
Cheers, kid.

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.840
Cheers, Bill.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.810
Off the wall. Hook shot.

01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:47.820
You suck.

01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:49.100
You suck.

01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:53.450
You know, I have to turn in a paper
on banking to get my final grade.

01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:56.840
Does it cover the variables
of office basketball?

01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:57.860
Very impressive.

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:00.010
I'm just surprised he's not
paying someone to write it for him.

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:03.500
Maybe he should stop paying people
to write papers for him.

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:05.700
Cheap shot.
Bill's right.

01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:07.670
You know, it's only money.

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:10.450
Not if you're the one making it. Yeah.

01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:14.670
Hey, what are you doing here?

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.860
l... I came to see my dad.

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:23.220
Um, then I just thought I'd stop by.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.220
What's going on?

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:29.290
Nothing.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:35.060
l... I was gonna see if you were doing
anything later tonight, um,

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.500
and you are.

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:39.850
You're busy, so...
Why don't you hang out?

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.650
No, thanks. l...

01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:43.600
No, I have to go.

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:45.420
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:52.740
You suck.

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:53.710
You suck.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:57.040
You both suck.

01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:03.340
Okay.

01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:04.650
Come on.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.150
Okay.

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:10.670
Can you drive around
for just a little bit longer?

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:13.100
No, I can't.
All right. Yeah.

01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:14.760
We'll go back to your place, then.

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:17.030
I'm dropping you off.

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.080
What? What? Come on. Come on.

01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:21.460
You gotta let me sleep over.
Like, I'm not kidding.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.940
Please, dude,
you gotta do this for me.

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:26.180
You have to.
She'll call one of her friends.

01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:28.940
She's calling one of her friends right now.
She's doing it.

01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:37.150
You've only had sex with one person
your entire life.

01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:40.670
Would you sh...
Now, you can change that.

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:42.640
Tonight, right now.
Mm-hmm.

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:44.560
You can change it.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.390
Cool tent.

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:53.890
Thanks.

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:58.500
So do you live here for real?

01:07:58.570 --> 01:08:01.800
Yeah. Um, temporarily.

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:06.210
Hey, do you get any, like,
wild animals out here?

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:10.180
We're in a backyard.

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:12.140
All right. Hey, take this.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:15.470
Now be careful.
That's White Widow.

01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:17.740
It's really strong.

01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:19.710
It's good. Trust me.

01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:21.859
Put on some music.

01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:26.189
Come on, we're dancing.

01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:29.540
Get up. Come on.
Get up. Give me your hand.

01:08:29.609 --> 01:08:32.910
Lucy? Lucy, my hand.
Take my hand, Lucy.

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:34.660
Get up.

01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:35.620
Bill, dance. Come on.

01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:37.600
Hold on.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.680
Come on, Bill. Get up.

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:42.950
Come on, Bill. Come on.

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.260
Come on, Billy.

01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:45.760
Come on.

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:50.510
Bill, dance with us.

01:08:50.569 --> 01:08:52.930
He'll be sorry.

01:08:59.819 --> 01:09:02.529
Whoo-hoo!

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.740
<i># I am the storm #</i>

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.390
<i># I am the wonder #</i>

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:08.960
<i># I am the flashlight #</i>

01:09:09.029 --> 01:09:12.229
<i># I twist, sudden explosion #</i>

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.069
Whoo!

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.149
Whoo-hoo!

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:27.590
What's going on out there?

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:30.300
Let him have some fun.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.740
It's 10:30.

01:09:35.819 --> 01:09:38.750
Go do some sit-ups.

01:09:38.819 --> 01:09:40.450
No.

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.010
Do not tell him. It's a secret.

01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:45.050
Wait. Wait.

01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:47.939
I have a really good secret.

01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:51.359
I got fake boobs.

01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:53.250
No way. You slut.

01:09:53.319 --> 01:09:54.820
I know!

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.030
I love that bra.

01:09:56.100 --> 01:10:00.610
And then the matching panties
with the little bows at the sides.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.020
Oh, my God.

01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:04.250
Fucking sweet.

01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:06.500
Can I touch 'em?
Of course.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.650
Oh, my God.

01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:08.700
Me, too.
Mm-mm.

01:10:08.770 --> 01:10:09.700
What?

01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:13.990
Oh, my God.
Bill, don't you wanna touch these?

01:10:14.050 --> 01:10:16.420
Don't you wanna feel them?

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.080
They look nice.

01:10:18.150 --> 01:10:20.670
Come on.

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:30.720
Come on. Just once.

01:10:44.890 --> 01:10:46.550
What are you doing?

01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:49.280
Making coffee.

01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:54.080
Put some pants on.
You look like a Froot Loop.

01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:56.480
It's actually pretty comfortable.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.840
Don't you have school?

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:00.990
It's Saturday.

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:04.040
The picnic.

01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:05.790
Don't worry, I'm making the coffee.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.500
Jesus.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.750
Ugh!

01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:52.720
Again.

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.000
Always stick close to me.

01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:01.440
When I'm walking, you always
have to be close to me.

01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:23.200
You guys, we gotta
get Jess out of here.

01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:25.150
Sarah brought Jim and Jane.

01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:28.780
Come on.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.830
Jess?

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.810
I said 50 yards.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.510
This doesn't concern you.

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.240
I can't believe you have
the nerve to bring her here.

01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:40.540
- Sir, you're gonna have to step back.
- It's not what it looks like, Jessica.

01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:43.450
Let go of me.
Meet me at the back entrance.

01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:47.060
Back... Okay. Come on,
Lucy, let's go. Come on.

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:53.880
Hi. I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna check on security.

01:12:57.370 --> 01:12:59.190
Get in.

01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:01.710
Your order said 50 yards.

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:29.550
Um, could I have everyone's attention,
please, ladies and gentlemen?

01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:31.800
Ladies and gentlemen. Ahem.

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:36.300
It's almost time for me to introduce
my father, Mr. John Jacobi.

01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:41.850
Right. But first I'd like to,
uh, take a quick look back

01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:45.110
to the year 1902.

01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:10.290
As legend has it, there wasn't even
a road that, uh, would get you here,

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:13.070
and once you did get here, well,
there wasn't that much to see.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:30.280
It was only through our family's
perseverance and foresight that we were...

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.400
What's going on?

01:15:42.930 --> 01:15:44.340
Bill!

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.110
Bill!

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.130
That was fucking awesome.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.340
Did you see the crack pipe?

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.470
Yes, I saw the crack pipe.

01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:01.260
What I want to know
is how it got in my car.

01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:03.020
You gotta admit it was
the highlight of the show.

01:16:03.090 --> 01:16:04.810
If I could stand up straight, I'd kill you.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.370
I gotta get some of those
crack pipes for homecoming.

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:09.810
Why don't you focus
on something productive?

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.810
Having fun is productive.

01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:22.570
Let's get out of here.

01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:27.310
You look like shit.

01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:34.860
Wanna stop at Big Bun?
I'm kind of hungry.

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.200
Yeah, let's do that.

01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:38.880
I'll take a double supreme,
large fries, and a soda.

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.300
No, I don't want
to stop at the Big Bun.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.990
I'm just kidding.

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:45.060
You're not still mad about
the crack pipe, are you?

01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:47.020
Shut up and drive.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.670
Asshole!

01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:54.020
<i>#... never wanna say good night #</i>

01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:56.510
<i># There's nothing left to say #</i>

01:16:56.590 --> 01:17:00.750
<i># Before we go #</i>

01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:02.410
<i># We will sing #</i>

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:07.300
<i># That we're all in love with you #</i>

01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:09.540
I'm gonna go check in.
You wait in the lobby.

01:17:09.610 --> 01:17:11.370
Okay.

01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:14.600
You haven't
figured one thing out.

01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:16.050
I've got one or two in there.

01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:20.010
No, you don't.

01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:21.540
Thanks for coming.

01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:22.830
I don't mind.

01:17:22.890 --> 01:17:24.780
See? You like hanging out with me.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.850
Of course
I like hanging out with you.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.230
Really?

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:29.890
Yeah.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:35.400
I mean, your obsession with women's
underwear is kind of creepy.

01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:37.030
There's nothing creepy about that.

01:17:37.090 --> 01:17:39.620
You're kind of a stalker.

01:17:39.690 --> 01:17:42.890
Here, I've been meaning
to give that to you.

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:45.380
Whoa. What's this for?

01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:48.650
You don't have to pay me
to be your friend.

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:50.200
I want to be.

01:17:51.690 --> 01:17:53.900
Thanks.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:57.060
I'd like to be your friend, too.

01:17:58.510 --> 01:18:00.870
I gotta go check up on Bill.

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:02.320
All right.

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.770
Whoa. Whoa.

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.140
Just friends.

01:18:07.210 --> 01:18:08.140
I get it.

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.180
Okay.

01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:10.720
- I get it.
- Okay.

01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:12.480
Hey.

01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:13.630
Sneaky little shit.

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.520
Oh, my God.
Will you put that thing away?

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.090
You're gonna break it. Oh.

01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:28.770
Hey. Thank God you called.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.780
The entire club
is out looking for you.

01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:32.380
The fourth hole is totally on fire.

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:33.410
I heard.

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.390
My father had to
cancel his announcement.

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:37.730
He's furious. I don't know
what I'm gonna tell him this time.

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:40.070
You know what?

01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:43.880
We've spent enough time
worrying about your father.

01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:46.840
The truth is I don't care
what he thinks about me.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.230
Bill...
No.

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:52.450
Did you know that every
single day all I can think about

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.930
is how much I hate working for him?

01:18:57.090 --> 01:18:59.620
I should've said something
a long time ago.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.310
Before this whole Chip Johnson thing.

01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:04.860
He's a total action news idiot.

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:07.170
What? The guy's an idiot.

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.180
He's right. He is an idiot.

01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:11.260
Fine, he's an idiot.

01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:13.430
But then, so what?

01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:16.540
This whole doughnut thing
is a new career?

01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:17.890
Oh, God, Jim and Jane.

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:19.810
They're going to think I'm insane.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.500
Yeah, they were a little confused
when I told them I was your wife.

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.800
Well, that's because I had
to tell them that you're Lucy,

01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:27.390
or Lucy was you, so that they
would get the deal done,

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:30.690
but I don't think I have
a doughnut franchise in my future.

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:34.470
Jess...

01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:37.760
I love you.

01:19:38.850 --> 01:19:40.770
But our lives suck.

01:19:48.710 --> 01:19:50.020
Can I give you a ride?

01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:53.430
No. I have one.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.020
Ohh...

01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:11.000
I'd like to tender my resignation,

01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:13.310
effective immediately.

01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:16.610
And I know my opinion
is of little consequence to you,

01:21:16.670 --> 01:21:18.160
but, uh...

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:21.100
I think hunting defenseless
animals for sport is...

01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:23.990
it's wrong.

01:21:25.150 --> 01:21:26.130
Oh.

01:21:26.210 --> 01:21:28.850
And, uh, John Jr. was right.

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:31.060
I don't belong here.

01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:34.590
You know what? I would have
done exactly the same thing

01:21:34.650 --> 01:21:36.060
to that Chip Johnson fellow.

01:21:39.710 --> 01:21:41.050
Good luck to you, Bill.

01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:43.860
Thank you, sir.

01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:49.390
Hi. They're waiting for you.

01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:55.390
...there is, we're on the corner...

01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:58.230
Hi.

01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:02.970
Your wife was just sharing
some of her ideas with us.

01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:05.170
Well, every partnership
has its up and downs.

01:22:05.250 --> 01:22:07.150
The important thing
is that you're able to stick it out.

01:22:07.230 --> 01:22:08.920
I don't think we've ever seen anyone

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:11.290
so committed to getting
one of our franchises.

01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:14.930
We did it.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.470
You did it.

01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:20.720
You look great.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.160
Are you happy?

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.350
I am happy.

01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:28.980
I am happy.

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:32.560
But not because of the doughnuts.

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.090
You know, before you got here,

01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:36.620
I was going to tell them
I didn't want the franchise anymore.

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:40.500
I think you should keep it.

01:22:40.570 --> 01:22:42.680
Why?

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:46.320
Because I don't think
this is the life that I want.

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.850
I don't want
to be the doughnut guy.

01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:52.620
I don't want to be the bank guy.

01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:57.590
Quite frankly, I'm kind of...

01:22:57.650 --> 01:22:59.700
sick of being the deranged fan guy.

01:23:01.170 --> 01:23:02.830
Okay.

01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:07.530
You can be whoever you want.

01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:03.840
Hey.

01:24:06.450 --> 01:24:07.700
It's your grade.

01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:10.760
I can't believe you're not
going to mentor me anymore.

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:13.930
Kid, you don't need a mentor.
You got it all figured out.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.380
Sometimes. But hey, I'm still
going to miss hanging out with you.

01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:19.280
I'll miss you, too, kid.

01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:21.230
But listen to me,
and this is important.

01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:24.600
I don't want you to float through life
pretending nothing matters

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:26.670
because trust me, one day
you're going to wake up,

01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:29.490
and you're going to realize
you don't have the life you wanted.

01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:32.430
You understand?

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:33.930
I understand, Bill.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.420
Good. All right, I have to go.

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:38.290
Where are you going?

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:41.030
I don't know,
but I'm excited to find out.

01:24:45.930 --> 01:24:46.880
Thanks, kid.

01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:56.780
Can I come visit?

01:24:56.850 --> 01:24:58.670
Check your locker.

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:07.270
Are you excited?

01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:20.170
Holy shit.

01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:45.930
<i># I know it's easier
to give up your dreams #</i>

01:25:47.530 --> 01:25:53.380

is harder than it seems #</i>

if I can't change myself? #</i>

01:26:56.610 --> 01:26:59.300

01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:50.280
<i># For all the things I had inside #</i>

01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:54.050

01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:57.760
