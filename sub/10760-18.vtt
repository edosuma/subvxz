[CLAPPING]

00:09.000 --> 00:10.500
Thank you. Thank you,
Brother Reynolds,

00:10.700 --> 00:11.800
for your inaugural ode.

00:11.900 --> 00:13.700
And may I congratulate you
on your ingenuity

00:13.900 --> 00:17.000
in rhyming "Sauvignon"
with "tie one on."

00:17.400 --> 00:18.500
Sir.

00:18.700 --> 00:20.900
And now,
as outgoing corkmaster,

00:21.100 --> 00:25.000
it is my privilege
to bestow the sash of office

00:25.300 --> 00:28.000
upon the newly-elected corkmaster.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.300
Which would be me.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.400
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you for your support.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.800
It humbles me,
and I only hope to live up

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
to the shining example
of my predecessor.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.600
[NILES LAUGHING]

00:39.900 --> 00:42.300
And, of course,
the example of my opponent,

00:42.600 --> 00:45.400
the other Brother Crane,
who so graciously conceded

00:45.800 --> 00:48.100
after that fourth recount. Uh...

00:48.500 --> 00:49.900
Is he here?

00:50.100 --> 00:52.400
I guess he's not.
Well, I'm sure he's with us in spirit.

00:52.800 --> 00:56.000
Uh, if you'll indulge me,
I've cobbled together a few remarks

00:56.200 --> 01:00.200
to express what this moment
means to me.

01:00.600 --> 01:05.300
I'm sorry. Don't start yet.
Oh, God. I'm terribly sorry I'm late.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.500
You know, it's just coming down
in buckets out there.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.700
- Hello, Frasier.
- Oh, hi.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Just as the cork protects the wine,

01:13.300 --> 01:15.800
as corkmaster,
I hope to protect the wine club

01:16.100 --> 01:18.500
from the forces
of metaphorical oxidation.

01:18.900 --> 01:21.500
Oh, Lord, Niles, are you in the middle
of your inauguration speech?

01:21.800 --> 01:23.800
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right. That's all right.

01:24.100 --> 01:26.300
It's just that I have an announcement
of my own to make.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.700
Yes, well, new business
is concluded, brother Crane.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.500
- I move we reopen new business.
- Second.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.000
- Denied.
FRASIER: Point of order.

01:32.100 --> 01:33.900
Once a motion's been seconded,
there's a vote.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.500
Just tell us your new business.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.700
To override procedure,
there must be a quorum.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.200
Very well. Move for a vote.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.500
- Second.
- All in favour?

01:41.700 --> 01:44.300
ALL: Aye.
- Motion carried. Make a note.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.100
- Noted, corkmaster.
NILES: Thank you.

01:47.700 --> 01:48.800
Proceed.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.400
I remember when we
used to come here to drink.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.600
- Go ahead.
- Corkmaster,

01:56.800 --> 01:58.500
members of the Wine Cabinet,

01:58.600 --> 02:02.400
esteemed brothers and sisters,
I come here tonight with a heavy heart.

02:02.800 --> 02:06.100
You see, I am resigning
from the wine club.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.100
- What?
REYNOLDS: Oh, no.

02:08.300 --> 02:11.300
This wouldn't have anything to do
with my winning the election, would it?

02:11.600 --> 02:14.100
No, no, of course not, Niles.
I couldn't be happier for you.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.500
You see, I've been afforded
a marvellous opportunity

02:16.700 --> 02:19.400
to pass on what I've learned here
to a much larger audience.

02:19.700 --> 02:20.800
Starting next week,

02:21.000 --> 02:25.900
I will be hosting a new feature
on KACL called <i>The Wine Corner</i>,

02:26.200 --> 02:29.000
just at the end of Gil Chesterton's
<i>Restaurant Beat.</i>

02:29.300 --> 02:30.700
[MURMURING]

02:32.700 --> 02:34.300
- Thank you.
- Can't you do both?

02:34.600 --> 02:36.900
Oh, well, no. Regrettably, no.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.500
You see, like this Camembert,

02:39.700 --> 02:44.300
I am at my most delicious
when I'm not spread too thin.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.400
But this isn't goodbye
by any stretch of the imagination.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.300
Please, I invite each and every
one of you to call into my show

02:50.500 --> 02:52.200
so that you can help me
get Seattle hooked

02:52.500 --> 02:54.600
on our sometimes whimsical,
always enlightened

02:54.900 --> 02:56.300
brand of discussion.

02:56.600 --> 02:59.100
But I've taken enough time
away from Niles.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.400
After all, this is his night.

03:01.700 --> 03:06.200
He has been elected corkmaster
of this fine club.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.600
Thank you, Frasier.

03:07.900 --> 03:10.600
I thought you were settling in
for a long farewell speech.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.000
- Second.
- All in favour?

03:12.200 --> 03:15.200
ALL: Aye.
- Well, if you insist.

03:16.200 --> 03:22.200
It was a short seven years ago,
on a night very much like this one,

03:22.700 --> 03:26.000
a man had a dream...

03:31.400 --> 03:33.700
[FOOTSTEPS]

03:34.000 --> 03:36.200
All right, Roz, now,
this is a very different kind of show

03:36.500 --> 03:38.700
we're gonna be doing,
so are you clear on the procedure?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.200
What's so hard?

03:40.400 --> 03:43.300
You talk for a while, I screen calls,
you answer them, I look interested...

03:43.600 --> 03:46.600
- Oh, I see the hard part.
- Oh, ha-ha, very funny.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.700
This is a list of the members
of the wine club.

03:48.900 --> 03:50.700
If any of these names
should happen to call,

03:50.900 --> 03:52.600
put them through,
and fasten your seat belt

03:52.900 --> 03:55.800
for an all-out, freewheeling
symposium.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.400
- Hey, there's my Renaissance man.
- Oh, Kenny.

03:58.700 --> 04:02.300
If you can't solve their problems
with therapy, solve them with drinking.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.300
Yes, well, let's just keep that
out of the ads, shall we?

04:06.600 --> 04:08.200
- Heh. Too late.
FRASIER: Oh.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.400
Kenny...

04:10.600 --> 04:13.400
And finally,
no review of Le Petit Oiseau

04:13.700 --> 04:16.600
would be complete
without a word about their décor.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.899
Hideous.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.600
I'll be back after these messages.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.900
[IN SING-SONG VOICE]
And we're out.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.300
Hi, Lance.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.100
Here's Frasier, and this is Roz.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.800
- She'll be producing the show.
- Hi.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.900
ROZ: Hi.
- Oh, my, isn't that interesting?

04:32.200 --> 04:34.700
Yes, well, Frasier wants me
to produce his segment of the show.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.200
We have to get the levels right to
accommodate the timbre of his voice.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.200
My, my, my,
isn't she the fuss-pot?

04:41.100 --> 04:42.300
Actually, it was my idea.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.900
[IN SING-SONG VOICE]
That's who I was talking about.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.400
Listen, Gil, I hope you don't mind
my doing this segment.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.400
Oh, perish the thought.
I'm ecstatic.

04:52.700 --> 04:53.800
As ecstatic as you would be

04:54.000 --> 04:56.900
if someone hijacked
the last 15 minutes of your show.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.000
Hey, Gil,
what is the deal with Lance?

05:00.300 --> 05:03.900
Oh, smitten already,
are we, Roz?

05:04.300 --> 05:07.100
Well, he's certainly catnip
to the ladies.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.000
No, that was... Really?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Well, that's what he claims.

05:14.300 --> 05:16.400
Of course, I've never actually
seen him with a woman.

05:16.700 --> 05:19.600
Well, just between us, I've always
thought he went the other way.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.800
Which way would that be?

05:24.400 --> 05:26.200
[IN SING-SONG VOICE]
And we're back.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.500
Normally at this time, I'd be doing
my final segment on food

05:29.800 --> 05:33.400
for the calorie-conscious,
"All Things Light and Edible."

05:33.600 --> 05:35.800
But, apparently,
health is going to take a back seat

05:36.000 --> 05:39.800
to the random musings
of a radio psychiatrist on wine.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.200
So without further ado,

05:41.500 --> 05:45.400
I give you <i>The Wine Corner</i>,
with your host, Dr. Frasier Crane.

for that gracious introduction.

05:59.300 --> 06:02.700
And hello to you, Seattle.
Welcome to <i>The Wine Corner.</i>

06:03.100 --> 06:05.300
I hope you're as excited
about this new programme as I am.

06:05.600 --> 06:10.700
I offer myself as Sherpa,
a guide, if you will,

06:11.100 --> 06:15.100
to lead you through the labyrinth
of vintages and wine lists,

06:15.500 --> 06:19.500
chateaus and bodegas,
and take you, hopefully,

06:19.900 --> 06:23.300
to a whole new level
of sophistication.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.300
In summary, Linda,

06:25.600 --> 06:29.500
the year listed on the bottle
is not an expiration date.

06:34.400 --> 06:39.900
So that wine from 1997
should be perfectly safe to drink.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.000
- Who else, Roz?
- We have ten seconds, Frasier.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.800
In that case, this is Frasier Crane

06:48.100 --> 06:51.800
reminding you that a great wine
is like a great woman,

06:52.000 --> 06:57.300
always intoxicating, ever surprising,
and only getting better with age.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.300
- Aw, do you really believe that?
- Oh, who cares, Roz?

07:01.600 --> 07:04.900
I stopped listening
to myself ten minutes ago.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.000
Are you sure no one
from the wine club called?

07:07.300 --> 07:10.600
I'm positive. Don't feel bad.
You got a lot of other callers.

07:10.900 --> 07:12.400
It's just that
I was hoping to provoke

07:12.700 --> 07:16.300
the same kind of spirited debates
we have at the wine club.

07:16.700 --> 07:19.200
No holds barred free-for-alls

07:19.400 --> 07:21.300
that sometimes go into
the wee hours of the night,

07:21.600 --> 07:24.500
and even spill out into the streets.

07:24.700 --> 07:28.800
Oh, Roz, we loved wine then.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.100
Huzzah, Frasier.

07:32.300 --> 07:36.000
I'm sure everyone who was listening
is hitting the bottle as we speak.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.900
Well, Lance and I
are going for a boys' night out.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.500

subtle for my listening audience.

"This delightful offering is infused
with the brooding,

08:12.700 --> 08:17.200

of vanilla."

08:18.900 --> 08:20.100
No, it's not too subtle,

08:20.400 --> 08:23.700
unless you want them to know
what the hell you're talking about.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.400
What, you don't think it's clear
that I enjoyed the wine?

08:27.700 --> 08:30.600
I don't think it's clear
you're talking about wine.

Oh, now, behave yourself, Dad.

08:37.700 --> 08:40.500
It's only until Daphne comes back.
You have no idea how difficult it is

08:40.799 --> 08:42.600
to find a therapist
that can also cook.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.300
- Her name is Frederica.
- Oh.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.100
Sounds German.
You know what that means.

08:46.400 --> 08:50.600
She was probably kicked off
the shot-put team for using steroids.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.500

anybody off the team for that.

lack of time, death.

of those excuses that I accept:

is corkmaster,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.700
which states that the club shall not,
through contract or deed,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
- endorse any commercial endeavour.
- Any commercial endeavour.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.000
Yes, you can hide
behind some flimsy by-law

12:13.200 --> 12:14.800
if you wish to
for as long as you like.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.900
We both know the subtext
behind this pretext, vindictiveness.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.600
- Oh. I've...
- In light of this abuse of power,

12:20.900 --> 12:23.700
I move that the corkmaster
be stripped of his title,

12:24.100 --> 12:26.500
and that some well-deserving
member be named in his stead.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.800
Oh. The motion fails
for lack of a second.

12:29.100 --> 12:32.200
- Second.
- Stop that. Motion denied.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.000
Point of order, a motion cannot
be denied that has been seconded.

12:35.300 --> 12:38.300
The chair doesn't recognise motions
from former members, ergo,

12:38.600 --> 12:40.700
there can be no second
to a motion that doesn't exist.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.300
I move whatever it takes
to get us to the bar.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.300
Second that.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.900
All right, the chair declares a state of
emergency and a five-minute recess.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.500
[BANGS GAVEL]

12:51.800 --> 12:54.700
I want you out of here. It's bad enough
you upstaged me the other night.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.100
I did no such thing.

12:56.300 --> 12:59.300
Oh, no, you could've picked any time
to announce your resignation,

12:59.600 --> 13:01.400
but you chose
my inauguration to do it.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.400
Nonsense, Niles.
Will you listen to yourself?

13:03.500 --> 13:05.700
- This is just a wine club.
- Just a wine club?

13:05.900 --> 13:08.500
That's not the platform
you campaigned on two years in a row.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.200
You can say anything
you want now,

13:10.400 --> 13:12.300
you know how important
this place is to me.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.800
Yes, and you know how important
my radio show is to me.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.600
Oh, well, I guess then we're even.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.100
So you admit it.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.600
You have dishonoured this club
with your selfishness.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.600
Yes, well,
at least I'm still in the club.

13:25.900 --> 13:28.600
You are a trespasser.
Sergeant at arms.

13:34.600 --> 13:38.300
Well, we can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

13:40.300 --> 13:43.000
All right, call off your henchman.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.100
All right, thank you.
Stand down, Brother Hefflewhite.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.800
I'm just trying to save you
from yourself, Niles.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.600
I see. Well, goodbye,
former brother.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.700
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

14:08.100 --> 14:10.700
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.100
Anything good on TV tonight?

14:19.800 --> 14:21.000
I don't know. Why?

14:21.400 --> 14:25.400
Oh, got the night free.
Thought we might hang out together.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.400
Oh, that's nice.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.100
You know, I usually have Wine Club
on Wednesday nights.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.900
What do you usually do
Wednesday nights?

14:37.900 --> 14:43.100
Oh, just sit back,
uh, enjoy the silence.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.400
Sounds good.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.100
- Seven thirty.
- Mm.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.800
Wonder what they're doing
at the wine club.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.400
Oh, jeez.
You gonna do this all night?

15:11.800 --> 15:13.700
No, no, Dad, you're right. I'm sorry.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.300
It's just that I hate to see
a once-proud institution

15:17.700 --> 15:19.700
making so many foolish mistakes.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.500
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
the club will probably fail without you.

15:23.900 --> 15:27.100
It'll be no fun.
All the members will resign.

15:27.400 --> 15:32.000
This time next month they'll probably
have torn the building down.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.300
I never know
when you're being facetious.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.200
Yeah, you do.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.700
All right, all right,
let's talk about something else.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.200
- How was your physical therapy?
- Oh.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.300
It was the most painful afternoon
of my life.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.900
She did things to me.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.600
Bad things.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.400
Well, Dad, I suppose
we could look for another therapist.

16:00.700 --> 16:05.300
Oh, hold on a second.
Here, try this.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.300
[LAUGHING]

16:08.700 --> 16:11.500
My God.
Oh, that sauerbraten is ambrosia.

16:11.800 --> 16:16.200
Oh, and wait till you wash it down
with her papa's homemade lager.

16:17.100 --> 16:18.100
How is everything?

16:18.400 --> 16:20.700
Oh, gosh, Frederica,
I've never tasted anything so divine.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.100
Oh, yeah, you see, Dr. Crane,

16:22.300 --> 16:25.600
I don't believe that fitness depends
on starving yourself.

16:25.900 --> 16:29.000
The secret is exercise, hard work,
then good food,

16:29.200 --> 16:30.900
and lots of it
when you've earned it.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.500
- Oh...
- Well, this is fabulous food.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.600
You haven't earned it!

FREDERICA:
That's just my way of having fun.

16:43.300 --> 16:46.800
Of course, you're welcome.
I'll get another plate.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.200
Thank you.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.500
We ought to get Niles over here,
you know.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.200
He'd love this stuff.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.000
Niles? Dad, I told you, Niles
is no longer welcome in this house.

16:57.300 --> 16:58.300
Thank you, Frederica.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.900
Oh, son, why don't you just
ask your brother to take you back?

17:03.300 --> 17:04.300
I did.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.099
I called him and I apologised.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.300
He would hear none of it.

17:10.599 --> 17:14.099
All he did was keep quoting rules
and by-laws.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.800
Just like when you were kids
with that fort.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.599
You were always making up
these big fancy rules

17:19.900 --> 17:22.800
and titles for yourself.
It always ended up in a fight.

17:23.099 --> 17:25.200
I didn't like it then,
and I don't like it now.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.599
All right, then,
we just won't talk about it.

17:27.900 --> 17:29.900
Besides,
I'm through with the wine club.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.300
Good. Why don't we
just enjoy our Wednesday?

17:32.600 --> 17:34.400
Second.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
All in favour?

17:37.700 --> 17:38.900
Aye.

Motion carried.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.600

Mm. Mm-hm, mm-hm.

I'm getting oak
with plummy overtones.

Niles, I wanna talk to you.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.800
Dad? What happened?
Is there something wrong?

18:04.100 --> 18:07.000
You're damned right there is.
It's about you and Frasier.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.400
Good God, you wear a sash?

18:12.600 --> 18:14.000
Frasier sent you down here,
didn't he?

18:14.300 --> 18:17.900
FRASIER: No.
- Frasier, get in here, now.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.700
Dad, this isn't necessary.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.900
Yeah, we can talk about this
some other time.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.500
Zip it up, both of you.

18:25.800 --> 18:29.500
I just gave up the best meal of my life
to come down here, so listen up.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.800
Niles, let your brother play.

18:35.600 --> 18:36.700
Dad, this is not a game.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.600
This is a club,
and Frasier broke the rules.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.000
- Technically, I did...
- Zip!

18:40.400 --> 18:42.900
Well, then you write a new rule
so that Frasier can come back.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.900
- First, I want an apology.
- I said zip it.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.200
- He did. I heard him.
- Don't get smart.

18:47.700 --> 18:49.700
Now, are you gonna
let your brother play?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.400
- Dad, l... Why...?
- Are you gonna let your brother play?

18:52.700 --> 18:55.100
Are you gonna
let your brother play?

18:56.900 --> 18:57.900
Fine.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.600
Am I gonna have any more trouble
between you two?

19:01.700 --> 19:03.700
- No.
- No.

19:04.700 --> 19:05.900
No what?

19:06.400 --> 19:07.400
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.300
Good. Now, shake hands.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.000
That's more like it.

19:13.300 --> 19:15.700
Now, you don't mind, I've got
a big plate of <i>Gewürzplätzchen</i>

with my name on it.

to the wine, shall we?

- Well, be that as it may...
- Zip it.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.300
- Niles.
- Hello, Frasier.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.300
Thought we could drive over
to Wine Club together.

19:48.700 --> 19:50.700
Actually,
I'm thinking about not going.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.300
Why not?

19:52.500 --> 19:58.100
Niles, truth be told, my enthusiasm
for the wine club has started to turn.

19:58.600 --> 19:59.700
I know what you mean.

19:59.900 --> 20:03.700
It used to be the wine club,
now it's just the teasing-people club.

20:04.100 --> 20:05.400
Then let's not go.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.500
They'll put our names
in the absent bottle.

20:07.700 --> 20:10.100
We'll have to bring
the crackers next time.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.600
- What if there's no next time?
- What do you mean?

20:13.900 --> 20:17.100
Niles, those people
don't care about wine.

20:17.500 --> 20:18.600
Not the way you and I do, no.

20:18.700 --> 20:21.300
What's preventing us from starting
a whole new club from scratch?

20:21.600 --> 20:24.500
- We could really get back to basics.
- Something that's just about wine,

20:24.900 --> 20:27.400
and a clear constitutional procedure
for enjoying it.

20:27.700 --> 20:30.400
Yes, well, then maybe this time
the governing body could be bicameral.

20:30.600 --> 20:31.700
Well, I don't know, Niles.

20:31.900 --> 20:34.200
There is something to be said
for the parliamentary system.

20:34.500 --> 20:38.000
Well, either way, we have to have
a strong judiciary to keep it in check.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.500
God, I love wine.
