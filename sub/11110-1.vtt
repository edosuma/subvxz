The Internet went down
for three hours this morning...

02:12.498 --> 02:15.399
plunging the nation into productivity.

02:15.467 --> 02:19.904

"startages" from New York to California...

04:35.807 --> 04:39.641
Apparently, a local area man
has misplaced his black socks.

04:39.711 --> 04:43.306
Mr. McCormick, would you please tell us
exactly what happened this morning?

04:43.382 --> 04:47.318
Sure. Um, I got up.
It was a normal morning.

04:47.386 --> 04:52.119
The kids are downstairs.
And, uh, my wife's giving 'em breakfast.

04:52.191 --> 04:55.888
And all of a sudden, I noticed
that my good black socks are missing.

04:57.963 --> 05:00.397
Here's your boy, ma'am,
safe and sound.

05:00.465 --> 05:02.558
Oh. Thanks, thanks.

05:02.634 --> 05:05.728
Look, sweetie. Look!

05:05.804 --> 05:07.999
<i>- The Onion News van!

05:10.676 --> 05:13.270
In other news, a local
eight-year-old accidentally...

05:13.345 --> 05:16.143
exercised his Second Amendment
rights yesterday...

05:16.215 --> 05:20.345
when he blew off his head
with his father's semiautomatic rifle.

05:20.419 --> 05:23.786
The fatal incident is being hailed
by gun rights activists...

05:23.855 --> 05:27.951
as a victory for America
and the Constitution.

05:31.230 --> 05:35.599
- Nobody move, unless you want
your head blown off!

05:35.667 --> 05:38.363
- You!
- Please. Please don't shoot me.

05:38.437 --> 05:40.371
I'll give you however much you want.

05:40.439 --> 05:43.272
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You think I want money?

05:43.342 --> 05:46.140
You think that's what this is about?

05:46.211 --> 05:48.611
A big, angry black man
comes walking in waving a gun...

05:48.680 --> 05:50.614
and you assume
he's robbing the place?

05:50.682 --> 05:54.345
I ain't looking for no goddamn handout.
I'm looking for a motherfucking job, bitch!

05:54.419 --> 05:59.015
- Excuse me?
- You heard me! A motherfucking job!

05:59.091 --> 06:02.788
<i>Don't you see? If you give me money,
that'll just help me in the short term.</i>

06:02.861 --> 06:07.855
But a job, that'll help me develop
valuable job skills and experience.

06:07.933 --> 06:10.663
It's like teaching a man how to fish.

06:10.736 --> 06:13.466
So quit stalling,
get your bitch ass back there...

06:13.538 --> 06:16.632

I'd like to deposit this check,
please, into my savings account,
and then I need to withdraw-

06:37.929 --> 06:41.592
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just shut the fuck up for a minute.

06:41.667 --> 06:44.295
What the fuck you doin', Liz Anne?
You callin' the cops?

06:44.369 --> 06:46.303
- No.
- If that's the goddamned cops-

06:46.371 --> 06:50.273
No, no, I swear. I was just on
with an account holder. I was advising him-

06:50.342 --> 06:53.175
I'm gonna kill you, bitch!

06:53.245 --> 06:55.907
Who the fuck's this?
You a cop? Mm-hmm.

06:55.981 --> 06:58.916
<i>Well, what I recommend is that
you keep at least 500 in your checking...</i>

06:58.984 --> 07:00.918
to just avoid
the minimum balance fee...

07:00.986 --> 07:04.251
and put the rest in our money market which
will earn you an additional 2% interest.

07:04.323 --> 07:07.349
<i>Right. You have a nice day, sir.
My pleasure. Uh-</i>

07:08.694 --> 07:10.958
Liz Anne, uh, sorry.

07:11.029 --> 07:12.963
My bad.

07:13.031 --> 07:15.363
That's okay.
Honest mistake.

07:15.434 --> 07:18.426
Armed gunman,
I've been watching you...

07:18.503 --> 07:22.405

Outstanding. Yeah, we're gonna get you

07:54.172 --> 07:56.106
I'll get you 8% on that one.

07:56.174 --> 07:59.337
Everybody down now!
Get the fuck down, everybody!

07:59.411 --> 08:02.346
Give me all the money!
Hurry up! Hurry the fuck up!

08:02.414 --> 08:04.348
<i>What you doing?
You playing back there?</i>

08:04.416 --> 08:07.647
Load the bag up with money,
and nobody else fucking move.

08:07.719 --> 08:09.949
You hurry up!
Hurry the fuck up!

08:10.021 --> 08:12.182
Load the bag up!
Load the bag-

08:16.027 --> 08:19.895
You sicken me.
Asking for a handout...

08:19.965 --> 08:23.423
instead of raising yourself up
out of your situation through hard work.

08:23.502 --> 08:27.632
Why don't you get a job like the rest of us?

08:30.375 --> 08:35.836
According to statistics,
87% of U.S. citizens are obese.

08:35.914 --> 08:39.475
And the surgeon general is taking steps
to address the problem.

08:39.551 --> 08:42.782
<i>- As a result of the rampant
spread of obesity in the U. S...</i>

08:42.854 --> 08:45.914
the government has been forced
to raise the definition of obesity...

08:45.991 --> 08:49.358
from 55% body fat to 90%.

08:49.428 --> 08:52.022
<i>The move, which reduces
the number of obese Americans...</i>

08:52.097 --> 08:54.827
<i>from 200 million to 185 million...</i>

08:54.900 --> 08:57.892
was widely applauded
from coast to coast.

08:57.969 --> 09:01.905
It's high time the government stepped in
and did something about this problem.

09:01.973 --> 09:05.500
I don't wanna be obese.
Man, that shit is all fucked up.

09:05.577 --> 09:08.478
In other news,
Georgia officials announced...

09:08.547 --> 09:12.711
<i>plans to add a swastika and middle finger
to the Georgia state flag.</i>

09:12.784 --> 09:17.153
Joe's Diner,
an unusual Atlanta area eatery...

09:17.222 --> 09:22.717
was not based around any sports,
music, or movie-based theme-

09:22.794 --> 09:25.661
<i>- Have you spoken to Norm about the changes?
- Not yet.</i>

09:25.730 --> 09:27.755
<i>- He's not gonna be happy.
- But he's got no choice.</i>

09:27.833 --> 09:32.532
Whatever the new parent
company says... goes.

09:34.072 --> 09:37.007
Melissa Cherry is America's
biggest pop sensation...

09:37.075 --> 09:41.535
selling millions of records
to her legions of teenage fans.

09:41.613 --> 09:45.379
But is this young singer
sending the wrong message?

09:45.450 --> 09:47.384
Kip Kendall reports.

09:47.452 --> 09:50.216
<i>Her new album, Come With Me...</i>

09:50.288 --> 09:53.689
<i>has gone quadruple platinum
and made her a household name.</i>

09:53.758 --> 09:58.422
# Baby, when we kiss
my heart just skips a beat #

09:58.497 --> 10:03.059
#And when you hold my hand
Oh, I can hardly speak #

10:03.134 --> 10:05.694
# Oh, yeah
I'm down on my knees #

10:05.770 --> 10:09.228
<i>But some concerned parents
think Melissa Cherry's...</i>

10:09.307 --> 10:11.298
<i>image and music are too sexy...</i>

10:11.376 --> 10:14.368
setting an inappropriate
example for their children.

10:14.446 --> 10:18.473
So, what do you say to
all the concerned parents out there?

10:18.550 --> 10:22.850
Well, Kip, I honestly don't understand
what all the fuss is about.

10:22.921 --> 10:25.389
My music isn't about sex.

10:25.457 --> 10:29.393
<i>It's about being a girl
and having fun.</i>

10:29.461 --> 10:33.830
But clearly the song, "Down on my Knees,"
Melissa, is about fellatio, isn't it?

10:33.899 --> 10:36.333
Ew. It's about how...

10:36.401 --> 10:38.801
like, when you have
a big crush on a boy...

10:38.870 --> 10:43.398
<i>sometimes you get down on your knees
and, like, beg for their love.</i>

10:43.475 --> 10:48.503
# Oh, I got so much love
I need to show it #

10:50.115 --> 10:53.312
What about your first big hit,
"Take Me From Behind"?

10:53.385 --> 10:57.253
"Take Me From Behind"
isn't sexual at all.

10:57.322 --> 11:00.382
It's about love sneaking up on you.

11:00.458 --> 11:03.154
You know, like from the behind.

11:03.228 --> 11:05.662
<i>You know, it could be a boyfriend's love
sneaking up on you...</i>

11:05.730 --> 11:09.598
or a friend's or even Jesus Christ.

11:09.668 --> 11:14.002
# But what I really want is for
you to take me from behind #

11:14.072 --> 11:16.370
# Oh, yeah #

11:16.441 --> 11:18.432
# Oh, yeah #

11:18.510 --> 11:21.070
# Oh #

11:21.146 --> 11:23.205
# Oh, oh #

11:23.281 --> 11:27.547
#When you love me right up front
you know that I don't mind #

11:27.619 --> 11:31.612
# But what I really want is for you
to take me from behind #

11:33.692 --> 11:37.628
Let's talk about the song,
"Lollipop Love."

11:37.696 --> 11:41.097
"Lollipop Love" is...

11:41.166 --> 11:44.499
the kind of love
that is just really sweet...

11:44.569 --> 11:49.006
and you just kind of want to lick it,
you know, and suck it.

11:51.343 --> 11:53.470
# Lollipop
Hey, yeah #

11:53.545 --> 11:55.706
# Lollipop #

11:55.780 --> 11:57.680
# Love #

11:57.749 --> 11:59.182
# Lollipop #

11:59.250 --> 12:03.311
<i># Love
Baby, baby #</i>

12:03.388 --> 12:05.913
# Lolly, lolly, lolly
lollipop #

12:05.991 --> 12:09.427
<i># Oh-ho, lollipop love #</i>

12:09.494 --> 12:11.724
Like a lollipop.

12:14.065 --> 12:17.933
What about the song
"Shoot Your Love All Over Me"?

12:18.003 --> 12:22.201
<i>That's about how, like,
when you're in love...</i>

12:22.273 --> 12:24.264
you just wanna be covered in it.

12:24.342 --> 12:28.608
# Shoot your love all over me #

12:28.680 --> 12:32.582
# Oh, drown me in a milky sea #

12:32.651 --> 12:36.087
<i># Love all over me #</i>

12:36.154 --> 12:38.520
But clearly, the video
seems to tell a different story.

12:38.590 --> 12:41.024
What kind is that?

12:41.092 --> 12:44.619
<i>- The kind with a... cum shot.
- I'm a virgin.</i>

12:44.696 --> 12:46.391
How would I know what a facial is?

12:46.464 --> 12:49.661
<i>Sometimes I like dressing up
sexy in my videos...</i>

12:49.734 --> 12:52.464
but that's just my way
of celebrating being a woman.

12:52.537 --> 12:55.472
<i>You know, people are always
gonna try to tear you down...</i>

12:55.540 --> 12:57.701
<i>but that's their problem, not mine.</i>

12:57.776 --> 13:01.143
<i>Because I know
who Melissa Cherry is.</i>

13:01.212 --> 13:05.342
<i>She's just a good, old-fashioned country girl
from Monroe, Tennessee.</i>

13:05.417 --> 13:07.408
<i># Baby ##</i>

13:10.088 --> 13:13.216
The pope condemned
three more glands today...

of sinful hormone secretion ducts...

13:43.354 --> 13:45.345
<i>Hey, Norm.</i>

13:50.762 --> 13:52.593
Hey, Norm. Okay.

13:52.664 --> 13:56.395
- Oh, there goes Norm again.
- He looks pissed.

14:07.078 --> 14:10.070
Onion tip line.
What do you got?

14:13.952 --> 14:16.318
Hey, Norm. What's up?

14:16.387 --> 14:18.378
Hey, Norman.

14:18.456 --> 14:20.356
What the hell was that?

14:21.693 --> 14:24.753
We'd, uh, been meaning
to talk to you about that.

14:24.829 --> 14:29.163
Um, it's Globie.
It's the Global Tetrahedron penguin.

14:29.234 --> 14:32.362
<i>Yeah, the folks at Global
Tetrahedron thought he'd be...</i>

14:32.437 --> 14:36.203
you know, a fun, unobtrusive way
to plug the company during the news.

14:36.274 --> 14:38.708
Plus, you gotta admit,
he is pretty fucking cute.

14:38.777 --> 14:41.143
Hi, Norm.

14:41.212 --> 14:45.512
Who's the best anchorman
in the whole world? You are!

14:45.583 --> 14:49.178
Come on, Norman.
You've gotta get with the times, mate.

14:49.254 --> 14:51.984
These kind of tie-ins are
commonplace these days, Norman.

14:52.056 --> 14:55.219
It's called synergy, Norm.

14:55.293 --> 14:58.751
We cannot have a shameless ad
for our parent company...

14:58.830 --> 15:00.991
running during the newscast.

15:01.065 --> 15:06.435
<i>It's a blatant compromise
of our journalistic ethics and integrity.</i>

15:09.040 --> 15:11.941
I'm sorry. It's just that, um-

15:12.010 --> 15:14.035
You know, what you're saying, it's-

15:14.112 --> 15:17.172
It's a steaming pile of shit, mate.

15:17.248 --> 15:23.016
<i>Norm, listen, what he's trying
to say is it's, uh, uh-</i>

15:23.087 --> 15:25.385
<i>- It's-
- Hilarious!</i>

15:25.456 --> 15:29.256
<i>It's off the wall!
It's rude, crude and uncensored.</i>

15:29.327 --> 15:33.286
<i>It's the very best of

21:05.997 --> 21:09.763
- In the car, darky.
- But I'm- I'm not black.

21:09.834 --> 21:11.927
<i>I'm white.
My whole family's white.</i>

<i>We go to the Fourth Avenue Lutheran Church

<i>Let's stand right over here.

Now, I just want you to point
to the perpetrator for me.

21:33.824 --> 21:38.523
Him. That... Negro.

21:38.596 --> 21:40.587
Okay, thanks.
We can go.

21:47.338 --> 21:50.000

22:10.328 --> 22:14.264
<i>There you have it. The Negro is guilty.</i>

22:17.168 --> 22:22.367
<i>- Welcome to

<i>Hello. We are now a good
way through the film...</i>

22:25.243 --> 22:29.009
so we thought it would be a good time
to get some perspective on it.

22:29.080 --> 22:32.049
And joining us to provide just that...

22:32.116 --> 22:35.085
<i>are Nicholas Van Essen
and Raymond Marcus.</i>

22:35.152 --> 22:39.452
<i>Offer us, if you will, your take on
how the film is doing thus far.</i>

22:39.523 --> 22:43.721
I'll have to say, Kenneth,
that I am very impressed.

22:43.794 --> 22:47.230
Sketch after sketch,
we're being treated to...

22:47.298 --> 22:51.234
a brilliantly biting skewering
of contemporary social mores.

22:51.302 --> 22:53.361
Well, Raymond, what do you think?

22:53.437 --> 22:55.997
<i>- I must strenuously disagree.
- Ah.</i>

22:56.073 --> 23:01.067
This is nothing but vulgar, low-brow,
potty humor thinly disguised as satire.

23:01.145 --> 23:05.479
<i>It saddens me that the Onion has stooped
to this lowest common denominator...</i>

23:05.549 --> 23:07.517
pandering to the masses.

23:07.585 --> 23:10.383
Well, now for a third opinion...

23:10.454 --> 23:12.388
let's go straight to the source.

23:12.456 --> 23:16.358
We have with us here
in the studio a very special guest.

23:16.427 --> 23:18.361
Welcome, Masses.

23:20.831 --> 23:23.391
So, what do you think of the film?

23:23.467 --> 23:25.765
It's pretty cool so far, I guess.

23:25.836 --> 23:29.203
That Cockpuncher dude is awesome.
Bam! Right in the balls.

23:29.273 --> 23:34.438
<i>But this part, with these film-expert assholes-</i>

23:34.512 --> 23:38.881
<i>I mean, why do you even have these two
gaywads in the movie for anyways?</i>

23:38.949 --> 23:40.780
Fags!

23:40.851 --> 23:44.150
Lose 'em and let's get on
with the movie, dude.

23:44.221 --> 23:47.713
<i>Gentlemen, experience the majestic splendor...</i>

23:47.792 --> 23:51.455
<i>of a cruise aboard the luxurious

<i>On the Queen Nathan, there's so much

23:55.766 --> 23:59.600
<i>shuffleboard, exquisite cuisine...</i>

<i>monster cocks.</i>

24:01.772 --> 24:03.899
<i>Grab a pole and go deep-sea fishing.</i>

24:21.025 --> 24:24.893
<i>So climb aboard the Queen Nathan II.</i>

24:24.962 --> 24:29.490
<i>And now it's time
for Little-Known Racial Stereotypes.</i>

24:29.567 --> 24:32.764
<i>Yes, everyone knows that
Italians are all mobsters...</i>

24:32.837 --> 24:35.101
<i>and Native Americans are all drunks.</i>

24:35.172 --> 24:39.199
<i>But did you know
that blacks love taffy?</i>

24:39.276 --> 24:43.303
<i>It's also true that Eskimos
run all the locksmith shops...</i>

24:43.381 --> 24:46.544
<i>the Irish have enormous nipples...</i>

24:46.617 --> 24:50.713
<i>and Puerto Ricans can dangle
from steel beams for hours at a time.</i>

24:50.788 --> 24:53.086
<i>Damn, that's unbelievable.</i>

24:53.157 --> 24:55.489
- How does he do that?
- Oh, he's a Puerto Rican.

24:55.559 --> 24:57.493
<i>- Also...
- Y'ello?</i>

24:57.561 --> 25:00.086
<i>did you know that the Dutch
enjoy speaking with telemarketers?</i>

25:00.164 --> 25:04.430
Visa? With a special
credit card offer?

25:04.502 --> 25:09.303
<i>Peruvians love to swoop in
and save the day at the last minute.</i>

25:09.373 --> 25:12.240
<i>And they can shoot laser beams
out of their eyes.</i>

25:12.309 --> 25:16.143
<i>And, of course,
all Arabs are terrorists.</i>

25:16.213 --> 25:20.013
<i>Ah, stereotypes. Can you imagine
a world without them?</i>

25:28.926 --> 25:32.054
Okay, that must be our final player.

25:37.201 --> 25:39.135
- Hi, Julie!
- Hi.

25:39.203 --> 25:41.467
- Welcome.
- Oh, your house is so lovely.

25:41.539 --> 25:44.030
Oh, thank you!
Come on in.

25:44.108 --> 25:47.043
- Everybody, this is Julie.
- Hi.

25:47.111 --> 25:49.511
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Hi, Julie.

25:49.580 --> 25:52.413
Have a seat. So, I understand this
is your first whodunit party?

25:52.483 --> 25:54.542
Ah, you are gonna
have so much fun! Okay!

25:54.618 --> 25:58.554
With any luck, by the end of the night
we'll figure out which one of us did the dirty deed.

25:58.622 --> 26:03.184
<i>Any one of us could be the rapist!</i>

26:03.260 --> 26:07.663
- I'm sorry. Did you say "rapist?"
- Yeah. Yeah, I did.

26:07.731 --> 26:12.293
Don't these things usually
revolve around, um, a murder?

26:12.369 --> 26:15.236
<i>Yeah, Julie, see,
we do this every few months...</i>

26:15.306 --> 26:19.606
and frankly, we were getting
a little bored with murder.

26:19.677 --> 26:22.578
So I was like, " Isn't there some other
violent crime we can reenact?"

26:22.646 --> 26:26.013
And I'm in the store the other day...
and I find this.

26:27.785 --> 26:31.585
How fantastic is that?

26:31.655 --> 26:35.955
So, anyway, Julie,
since you are new, luckyJulie...

26:36.026 --> 26:40.395
you get to be the victim.

26:40.464 --> 26:42.591
<i>Okay?</i>

26:42.666 --> 26:45.726
- Ooh.
- So, I want you to put this on. Hop up.

26:45.803 --> 26:48.067
Okay, so here's what's gonna happen.

26:48.138 --> 26:52.165
The lights are gonna go out.
So, you lie down on the floor.

26:52.243 --> 26:56.771
We're all gonna come running in, but you're
gonna be unconscious, so you stay down there.

26:56.847 --> 26:59.975
Don't you think this is a little... sick?

27:00.050 --> 27:03.918
Oh, sweetie, it's all in fun.
No one's actually raping anyone.

27:06.056 --> 27:08.991
I mean, you wouldn't have a problem with
a murder-mystery game now, would you?

27:09.059 --> 27:12.392
- I guess not.
- Yeah, so why would you object to a game...

27:12.463 --> 27:16.399
revolving around a lesser crime
where no one even loses their life?

27:16.467 --> 27:18.401
- Well, it's just different.
- Oh, "it's just, it's just"!

27:18.469 --> 27:21.734
Come on, guys.
Let's play the game.

27:21.805 --> 27:24.603
Get your cards. Okay?

27:27.077 --> 27:29.307
CD in here.
You got that on, sweetie?

27:29.380 --> 27:31.644
Okay, get down on the floor.
Get down on the floor.

27:31.715 --> 27:33.842
Ready for a rapin'?

27:36.587 --> 27:40.318
Oh, no, please don't rape me.

27:40.391 --> 27:44.293
- Shut up, you bitch!
- No, no, please, Mr. Raper Man.

27:44.361 --> 27:46.556
- Shut the fuck up!
- What are you doing?

27:46.630 --> 27:48.564
Shut up, bitch!

27:48.632 --> 27:51.123
- Oh, no!
- Shut up!

27:56.740 --> 27:58.708
Wow.

27:58.776 --> 28:02.974
" Oh, no. The sweet, innocent,
young daughter of Mayor Lewis has been raped.

28:03.047 --> 28:06.608
Lock the door. No one is leaving
until we figure out who did it."

28:06.684 --> 28:08.618
- Nice accent.
- Thanks, man.

28:08.686 --> 28:11.655
<i>Who committed this rape? Hmm?</i>

28:11.722 --> 28:14.213
Was it... the creepy uncle?

28:16.226 --> 28:19.059
The handsome, young Ivy League
fraternity brother...

28:19.129 --> 28:22.155
who's used to getting what
and who he wants?

28:24.301 --> 28:26.861
Um, the prisoner
just released on parole? That's me.

28:26.937 --> 28:30.873
Or the vaguely hermaphroditic
night nurse...

28:30.941 --> 28:32.909
from the senior center
just down the block?

28:32.977 --> 28:37.812
<i>Ooh, he's so creepy!
Okay, come on. Let's play! Let's play!</i>

28:37.881 --> 28:40.714
"I was with my wife.

28:40.784 --> 28:44.618
"Besides, that bitch has been
making up stories since she was four.

28:44.688 --> 28:47.350
You can't believe anything she says!"

28:47.424 --> 28:50.518
"I have 22 fraternity brothers
who will vouch that I was with them."

28:52.496 --> 28:56.023
Oh, I bet you do.
Okay, time to spin.

28:56.100 --> 28:59.433
Whoa, Julie, I know this
is your first time...

28:59.503 --> 29:02.563
- but you're not acting very raped.
- Okay.

29:02.640 --> 29:06.041
Oh, no, no, Julie, you can't stand up.
You've just been raped.

29:06.110 --> 29:08.943
The rapist shattered
your pelvis with a baseball bat.

29:11.015 --> 29:12.949
Um, I'm leaving.

29:13.017 --> 29:15.781
Wha-What?
Where are you going?

29:15.853 --> 29:19.880
Ju- Come-Julie, wh-

29:21.191 --> 29:23.182
Now what?

29:25.362 --> 29:29.128
I guess you guys are just gonna have to rape me.

29:29.199 --> 29:32.293
<i>Oh, no, please don't rape me.</i>

29:35.539 --> 29:39.635
Taffy?
God! Fucking blacks!

29:43.781 --> 29:47.080
The nation's anti-tobacco lobby
won another victory today...

29:47.151 --> 29:51.645
when Congress passed legislation
restricting smoking within U.S. borders...

29:51.722 --> 29:54.088
<i>to a single room in Iowa.</i>

29:54.158 --> 29:56.820
<i>- Traffic was backed up from
Nevada all the way to lowa...</i>

29:56.894 --> 29:59.294
<i>as smokers tried to get to the lounge.</i>

29:59.363 --> 30:02.662
Move the car,
you old, fucking bitch!

30:02.733 --> 30:05.634
<i>Smokers from across the country
are making the long journey...</i>

30:05.703 --> 30:09.799
<i>to the 10-by-10 smoker's lounge
in Des Moines, Iowa.</i>

30:09.873 --> 30:13.741
I drove all the way from San Francisco
just to sneak a smoke in on my lunch break.

30:13.811 --> 30:16.678
I'm supposed to be back
at work in 10 minutes.

30:16.747 --> 30:20.342
It's a 37-hour drive.
It's fuckin' bullshit!

30:20.417 --> 30:24.478
In legal news, a judge has declared
local aerobics instructor...

30:24.555 --> 30:29.822
and accused murderer, Jennifer Porter,
too fit to stand trial.

30:29.893 --> 30:32.726
Judge Edward Conlin
said that the suspect...

30:32.796 --> 30:35.856
with her washboard abs
and powerful leg muscles...

30:35.933 --> 30:38.527
is of too sound body...

30:38.602 --> 30:41.969
to be tried for the killing
of her ex-lover.

30:44.341 --> 30:47.105
According to a new medical study...

30:47.177 --> 30:50.510
depression hits losers hardest.

30:50.581 --> 30:53.880
The study found that extreme,
debilitating depression...

30:53.951 --> 30:57.284
most commonly afflicts
those who are total screw-ups...

30:57.354 --> 30:59.618
who can't do anything right.

31:06.096 --> 31:08.030
Are you ready?

31:09.099 --> 31:11.499
Oooh.

31:11.568 --> 31:16.028
# Baby, when we kiss
my heart just skips a beat #

31:16.106 --> 31:20.839
#And when you hold my hand
Oh, I can hardly speak #

31:20.911 --> 31:26.008
# But there's one kind of lovin'
that we can't do face to face #

31:26.083 --> 31:31.749
# So let me give you some affection
just below your waist #

31:31.822 --> 31:34.950
- I like that.
- # Oh, yeah, I'm down on my knees for you #

31:35.025 --> 31:39.018
# I'm beggin' please, please for you #

31:39.096 --> 31:43.829
# Oh, got so much love
I need to show it #

31:43.901 --> 31:47.428
# It's a big job
Don't wanna blow it #

31:47.504 --> 31:50.667
# Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah #

31:50.741 --> 31:53.733
# Oh #

31:55.579 --> 31:57.740
# Baby
Down on my knees #

31:57.815 --> 31:59.749
# Beggin' please, please ##

From Global Tetrahedron Pictures,
Steven Seagal is-

32:02.686 --> 32:07.055
<i>Hey, welcome to Volt Village. My name's Dirk.
What can I help you find today?</i>

32:07.124 --> 32:09.524
Hey, Dirk.
Um, my computer...

32:09.593 --> 32:12.790
it's a few years old,
and I feel like I'm ready for a new one.

32:12.863 --> 32:15.855
I got just the thing.

32:15.933 --> 32:19.664
The Bates 4000.
Absolute cutting-edge.

32:19.736 --> 32:22.466
These babies came in on Tuesday.
They're packed, man.

32:22.539 --> 32:24.837
Eighty "G's" of RAM.

32:24.908 --> 32:27.900
We're talking
a quad-port 900 processor...

32:27.978 --> 32:30.674
D.V.K. compatible memory card...

32:30.747 --> 32:32.681
dual-burning DVD drives...

32:32.749 --> 32:35.912
plus a 16,000 C.T.C. combo-drive...

32:35.986 --> 32:38.716
with a plus-four digital
upgrade card.

32:38.789 --> 32:41.724
This will knock the shit
out of your ass.

32:43.427 --> 32:47.090
Well, I'm just looking for your basic,
simple home computer.

32:47.164 --> 32:51.294
I know, your wife has you
by the purse strings. But you know what?

32:51.368 --> 32:53.996
This is the Bates 4000.
It doesn't get any better than this.

32:54.071 --> 32:56.665
It's not going anywhere.
This is the future.

32:56.740 --> 32:59.504
Well, I have the Bates 1000
and that worked-

32:59.576 --> 33:01.942
<i>Oh, excuse me.
You have the Bates 1000.</i>

33:02.012 --> 33:05.675
Oh, that's great!
Fuck, man, wow!

33:05.749 --> 33:09.344
<i>Maybe you should talk to a homeless woman
outside 'cause maybe she'll be impressed.</i>

33:09.419 --> 33:11.512
Those things are barbaric.

33:11.588 --> 33:14.523
I mean, last time I checked,
they didn't even have a delete key on it.

33:14.591 --> 33:19.426
I'm joking, of course. But look,
this is the future. You get my point?

33:19.496 --> 33:22.659
- Yeah.
- Okay? Let's write you up.

33:22.733 --> 33:26.294
- All right, let's do it.
- All right, my friend.

33:30.741 --> 33:33.904
Wow, honey. Are you sure
we needed such a fancy one?

33:33.977 --> 33:36.741
You kidding? This thing's got
a quad-port 900 processor...

33:36.813 --> 33:39.714
and a 16,000
C.T.D. combo-drive with-

33:39.783 --> 33:43.844
Dude, you're not still using
the Bates 4000, are you?

33:43.921 --> 33:46.048
That thing's ancient.

33:46.123 --> 33:48.353
<i>- Really?
- Really.</i>

33:48.425 --> 33:53.829
You got to get you one of these:
the Bates 5000.

33:53.897 --> 33:55.990
Absolute cutting-edge.

33:56.066 --> 33:59.558
<i>Wow, that is newer.
Thanks.</i>

34:01.705 --> 34:03.570
The new Bates 5000.

34:03.640 --> 34:07.167
Throw your 4000 away.
It's a piece of shit.

34:17.621 --> 34:20.748
<i>This is Hard Drive Hal, your computer expert.</i>

34:20.824 --> 34:24.282
<i>My guest today
is Bates C.E.O. Gil Bates.</i>

34:24.360 --> 34:27.989
<i>Now, he's here to talk about perhaps
the most powerful machine ever built:</i>

34:28.065 --> 34:31.694
<i>the Bates 6000,
and it's available in stores right now.</i>

34:34.838 --> 34:37.670
Asshole!

34:44.648 --> 34:47.081
Hey, I just dropped off
a shipment of the Bates 7000s.

34:47.150 --> 34:49.777
Now, what do you want me
to do with the leftover 6000s?

34:49.853 --> 34:54.085
6000s? Throw 'em in the fucking
garbage where they belong.

34:57.160 --> 35:00.960
<i>That's right. Twice the memory
capacity of the 8000.</i>

35:01.031 --> 35:04.091
Mr. Bates, you have a visitor.
- Hang on. Come in.

35:04.167 --> 35:06.931
Hi.

35:07.004 --> 35:11.600
Bates was 42.

35:11.675 --> 35:15.406
In other news, after a six-month
stint at the Betty King Clinic...

35:15.479 --> 35:18.471
actor Bryce Brand
finally returned home today.

35:18.548 --> 35:23.042
That's right, Norm. I'm here outside superstar
Bryce Brand's Hollywood Hills mansion...

35:23.120 --> 35:28.080
where, at any moment, he's due to return
from his stay at the Betty King Clinic.

35:28.158 --> 35:30.422
<i>Bryce!</i>

35:34.297 --> 35:36.663
Bobby, baby!

35:36.733 --> 35:39.293
- Bryce.
- Bobby, baby!

35:39.369 --> 35:42.930
Bobby, baby!

35:43.006 --> 35:45.998
- I'm back!
- You look great.

35:46.076 --> 35:50.410
I cannot tell you how good I feel
now that I'm off the drugs...

35:50.480 --> 35:52.573
and high on life.

35:52.649 --> 35:54.776
<i>Hey, that's what they're saying.</i>

35:55.852 --> 36:01.518
<i>Oh, man, was I a mess.</i>

36:01.591 --> 36:05.254
<i>But all that's changed now
that I'm clean and sober.</i>

36:05.328 --> 36:10.561
You know, I never knew how amazing
life can be without the haze of drugs.

36:10.634 --> 36:14.866
It's just the little things, like...

36:14.938 --> 36:17.736
smelling the flowers-

36:20.243 --> 36:24.771
<i>Or watching the sunset,
or just walking along the beach.</i>

36:24.848 --> 36:29.376
You know, these things get me
way higher than drugs ever could.

36:29.453 --> 36:31.717
<i>That's great, um, Bryce.</i>

36:31.788 --> 36:35.622
So, we have got a lot of
catching up to do with your career.

36:35.692 --> 36:38.126
<i>Now I brought a script. It is fantastic.</i>

36:38.195 --> 36:40.823
Actually, your part is comedic.
Uh, sort of a wise-cracking-

36:40.897 --> 36:43.229
Bob, this chamomile is so amazing.

36:43.300 --> 36:46.861
It is blowing my mind, man.
Smell this.

36:46.937 --> 36:49.201
No. Thank you, though.

36:49.272 --> 36:52.469
Um, back to the script.
Again, it took a lot to get this-

36:52.542 --> 36:54.874
Bob, one thing sobriety
has taught me...

36:54.945 --> 36:59.075
is that you have to take time out
to enjoy life's little pleasures.

36:59.149 --> 37:02.141
Can you put the tea down for a sec?

37:03.753 --> 37:06.916
- Bryce?
- Oh, my God.

37:06.990 --> 37:09.322
<i>- Bryce.
- Oh, my God.</i>

37:13.396 --> 37:16.263
The nation's rapidly growing
prison population...

37:16.333 --> 37:19.097
which recently passed
the 20 million mark...

37:19.169 --> 37:21.865
has created
a severe overcrowding problem.

37:21.938 --> 37:24.372
<i>In an attempt to alleviate
the overcrowding...</i>

37:24.441 --> 37:27.968
<i>the government announced today
that a random selection of U.S. households...</i>

37:28.044 --> 37:31.036
<i>will be asked to take prisoners
into their homes.</i>

37:35.719 --> 37:39.553
Hi. Uh, I'm Dick.

37:41.158 --> 37:43.092
This-This is my wife, Sarah.

37:43.160 --> 37:44.957
This is our daughter, Allie.

37:45.028 --> 37:48.657
And this is our son, Bobby. He's 10.

37:48.732 --> 37:51.633
Welcome to our home.

37:51.701 --> 37:53.635
'Sup.

37:56.907 --> 37:59.307
Don't drop this shit on me, bitch!

37:59.376 --> 38:04.370
What the fuck are you doing? Don't just
stand there! Get your man something to drink!

38:10.720 --> 38:13.746
Damn, it's good to see some women.

38:13.823 --> 38:15.757
Mm-mm-mm.

38:15.825 --> 38:19.989
Mr. Prisoner, my tattoo hurts.

38:20.063 --> 38:22.463
Lights out, guys.

38:24.467 --> 38:27.129
If successful,
another 20,000 prisoners...

38:27.204 --> 38:31.504
will be moved to suburban homes
by the first of next month.

38:35.212 --> 38:38.272
<i>Hello and welcome once again
to Focus on Film.</i>

38:38.348 --> 38:40.282
I'm Kenneth Garber.

38:40.350 --> 38:43.080
And I'm joined by Kwame Roberts...

38:43.153 --> 38:46.122
<i>president of the National Coalition
of African Americans...</i>

38:46.189 --> 38:51.149
and James Nakatami, director of
the Asian American Alliance for Equality.

38:51.228 --> 38:53.719
Mr. Roberts, let's start with you.

38:53.797 --> 38:59.133
Your organization is not pleased with
this film's depiction of African Americans.

38:59.202 --> 39:02.069
Oh, that is absolutely correct, Kenneth.

39:02.138 --> 39:04.436
We are just about halfway
through the film...

39:04.507 --> 39:08.170
and we've yet to see a dignified
portrayal of a person of color.

39:08.245 --> 39:12.682
So far, we've only been shown
as vicious criminals or sex fiends.

39:12.749 --> 39:14.717
Just take a look at that last sketch.

39:14.784 --> 39:17.116
So, what specifically
is your group demanding?

39:17.187 --> 39:21.214
The filmmakers put a positive black role model
on that screen in the next 10 minutes...

39:21.291 --> 39:25.921
<i>or we will be organizing a nationwide
walkout of black moviegoers.</i>

39:25.996 --> 39:29.397
That means every single African American
currently watching this film...

39:29.466 --> 39:31.400
will exit the theater.

39:31.468 --> 39:33.732
<i>Mr. Nakatami,
you are equally unhappy?</i>

39:33.803 --> 39:36.465
<i>Thus far, there are maybe one...</i>

39:36.539 --> 39:40.498
<i>or, at the most, two,
three Asian faces in the film.</i>

39:40.577 --> 39:43.808
How do you feel about such
gross underrepresentation?

39:43.880 --> 39:46.781
Me no "rikey."

39:48.652 --> 39:50.244
Excuse me?

39:50.320 --> 39:52.652
Me no "rikey."

39:52.722 --> 39:56.658
And... back to the film.

39:56.893 --> 39:59.919
In legal news, local
18-year-old Joey Frankel...

39:59.996 --> 40:04.296
is suing for the right to be
sexually harassed in the workplace.

40:04.367 --> 40:07.962
Frankel, an employee
at Carl's Copy Shop in Phoenix...

40:08.038 --> 40:10.302
alleged that during
his three years there...

40:10.373 --> 40:15.436
not a single female coworker made
inappropriate sexual advances toward him...

40:15.512 --> 40:18.276
either verbal or physical.

40:19.516 --> 40:21.643
In other news, health officials
have confirmed...

40:21.718 --> 40:24.619
that a potentially deadly
airborne virus...

40:24.688 --> 40:27.248
has been spreading
across eastern Canada.

40:27.324 --> 40:31.055
And is now moving south towards the coast of-

40:49.612 --> 40:51.546

Okay.

40:51.614 --> 40:54.845

- He looks pissed.

41:05.929 --> 41:08.261
Onion tip line.
What do you got?

41:11.668 --> 41:13.602
- All right. Listen to me.
- Hi, Norm.

41:13.670 --> 41:18.107

41:24.881 --> 41:30.148
<i>In this crazy world, the Onion may be
the only news source that people can truly trust.</i>

41:30.220 --> 41:33.348
<i>Look, don't be so naive, Norm.
This is a business.</i>

41:35.992 --> 41:39.393
Listen, Norm. I know you're not
gonna want to hear this.

41:39.462 --> 41:41.453
But the suits at
Global Tetrahedron...

41:41.531 --> 41:45.365
want you to open up Friday's broadcast
with a slightly different lead story.

41:48.638 --> 41:51.801
But Friday is the day
Azmenistan gave Sloravia...

41:51.875 --> 41:54.867
as a deadline for pulling out
of the Uzbagiyak region.

41:54.944 --> 41:58.345
<i>It's also the day that
Cockpuncher opens.</i>

41:58.415 --> 42:02.511
I mean, this Azmenistani, uh, sloppy
ground thing is all well and good, right?

42:02.585 --> 42:05.076
But it's a million miles away.
Nobody gives a fuck about it.

42:05.155 --> 42:08.818
<i>The more important news story
right now is Cockpuncher mania.</i>

42:08.892 --> 42:11.053
It's sweeping the nation.

42:11.127 --> 42:13.994
And it better sweep
your newscast Friday.

42:15.865 --> 42:17.230
Take a putt?

42:18.401 --> 42:19.868
No?

42:29.779 --> 42:33.374
You owe me a pound,
you son of a bitch. I made that last one.

42:33.583 --> 42:36.245
<i>From Global Tetrahedron Pictures...</i>

42:36.319 --> 42:38.810
- Steven Seagal is-
- Awesome!

42:38.888 --> 42:43.222
Goddamn whorish corporate plugs.

42:45.995 --> 42:47.929
I'm a newsman, damn it.

42:47.997 --> 42:50.192
<i>Oh!</i>

42:53.770 --> 42:56.762
<i>- Cockpuncher.
- I don't think you have the balls.</i>

42:56.840 --> 43:00.435
Oh, I cannot wait for Friday.

43:04.314 --> 43:06.748
- Excuse me, sir.
- What can I get you?

43:06.816 --> 43:09.979
No, thank you. I don't drink,
or use drugs for that matter.

43:10.053 --> 43:14.012
No. I was just wondering if you could
give me directions to the local library.

43:14.090 --> 43:17.753
Um, two blocks down
and left on Second.

43:17.827 --> 43:21.194
Thank you very much.
You have a wonderful evening.

43:27.036 --> 43:29.766
Mm-hmm.

43:35.178 --> 43:37.612
Thank you.
You have a wonderful evening.

44:22.759 --> 44:26.422
<i>Uh, help?</i>

44:27.764 --> 44:30.995
Has your penis become stuck
in a library book return slot?

44:31.067 --> 44:34.628
<i>Call Kostman's, the penis people.</i>

44:34.704 --> 44:36.638

<i>That's my personal guarantee.</i>

<i>So don't just sit there hoping that your penis

44:50.453 --> 44:52.148
<i>Call Kostman's.</i>

44:52.221 --> 44:54.951
- Dave got my penis out.
- Dave got my penis out.

44:57.393 --> 44:59.657
Dave got my penis out.

44:59.729 --> 45:02.459
Dave got all our penises out!

45:02.532 --> 45:04.466
<i>Kostman's, the penis people.</i>

45:09.572 --> 45:11.506
This week's campaign is gonna rule.

45:11.574 --> 45:14.236
I can't wait for the assault
on castle Dragonflame.

45:14.310 --> 45:16.608
I know. It's gonna be
super totally awesome.

45:16.679 --> 45:21.207
I have a third-level elven cleric
I can't wait to pit against my foes.

45:21.284 --> 45:24.776
Well, uh, don't count on it being too awesome.
Look who just showed up.

45:27.590 --> 45:32.823
<i>Well, what have we stumbled upon here?</i>

45:32.895 --> 45:34.726
Oh, shit.

45:34.797 --> 45:37.391
Dare you challenge the might
of Proteus the Invincible?

45:40.336 --> 45:45.239
Ah, I see there are some beardless saplings
with us this afternoon...

45:45.308 --> 45:48.368
who have ne'er tasted my blade.

45:48.444 --> 45:50.344
This douche bag ruins everything.

45:50.413 --> 45:52.677
Prepare for total devastation.

45:54.984 --> 45:57.452
<i>The magical wizardry,
expert chaos techniques...</i>

45:57.520 --> 46:01.217
and incomparable equipment roster
of Proteus the Invincible...

46:01.290 --> 46:06.523
will make short work
of all pretenders to the throne.

46:16.873 --> 46:18.807
Okay, Lyle.

46:18.875 --> 46:23.107
How's about letting some of
the younger guys have a chance today?

46:23.179 --> 46:25.147
Okay?

46:25.214 --> 46:28.581
When it comes to Wizards and Warbeasts,
I expect no quarter.

46:28.651 --> 46:30.915
And none shall be given.

46:33.156 --> 46:35.090
All right.

46:44.801 --> 46:49.261
Now that I have readied my provisions
for the day's foray into the fairy realms...

46:51.774 --> 46:54.470
let the slaughter begin.

47:41.691 --> 47:44.660
None remain standing before me.

47:44.727 --> 47:49.187
All have fallen before
the might of my broadsword.

48:00.109 --> 48:04.910
Hope you're happy, Lyle. You just ruined
another Saturday for the whole gaming club.

48:04.981 --> 48:07.882
What care I for
the sniveling excuses of the weak?

48:07.950 --> 48:10.783
They shall bow before my wrath.

48:10.853 --> 48:15.813
In the realm of fantasy, only the strong
shall survive to conquer another day.

48:15.892 --> 48:18.383
Whatever.

48:24.467 --> 48:28.335
Alas, the day's adventuring
is now done...

48:28.404 --> 48:32.170
and I must take
the number two bus back home.

48:32.241 --> 48:37.235
If only I could live in
the world of fantasy forever...

48:37.313 --> 48:40.407
instead of being forced to
put up with this banal realm...

48:40.483 --> 48:43.145
and its silly, weak-minded mortals.

48:45.221 --> 48:50.284
Oh, how I wish I could live in
the realm of Wizards and Warbeasts...

48:50.359 --> 48:53.021
ruling the land as
a mighty conqueror...

48:53.095 --> 48:58.294
smiting orcs and ogres alike
with my trusty broadsword.

48:58.367 --> 49:03.100
<i>Proteus the Invincible?</i>

49:03.172 --> 49:07.700
<i>- I have heard your plea.
- What?</i>

49:07.777 --> 49:13.716
<i>- Who-Who goes there?
- It is I, Gygax, demon of the Astral plane.</i>

49:13.783 --> 49:17.810
<i>Never before have I seen your equal
among the mortals that play this game.</i>

49:17.887 --> 49:20.549
What's going on? Guys?

49:20.623 --> 49:23.888
<i>I have chosen to grant your wish,
Proteus the Invincible.</i>

49:25.094 --> 49:28.928
<i>Come forth into the land of legends.</i>

49:33.970 --> 49:36.302
God. Where am I?

49:38.374 --> 49:40.308
Ow!

50:01.264 --> 50:03.664
<i>Oh, God. Where am I?</i>

50:03.733 --> 50:06.998
<i>Proteus.</i>

50:11.908 --> 50:15.435
Prepare to piss thyself, human.

50:17.113 --> 50:20.514
No, no, no.
No. No. No. No. Please.

50:24.220 --> 50:26.984
Fucking geek.

50:27.056 --> 50:29.820
After last night's heartbreaking
loss in Los Angeles...

50:29.892 --> 50:34.488
basketball star Dashante Jackson
had harsh words for the lord.

50:34.563 --> 50:37.031
You know, I'd like to put
the blame on God tonight...

50:37.099 --> 50:41.661
<i>for not blessing me with the talent to
hit the game-winnin' three-pointer tonight.</i>

50:41.737 --> 50:45.833
You know, without him,
I would truly be goin' to the play-offs.

50:45.908 --> 50:48.308
Bitch, I don't know why
you do this shit to me!

50:51.213 --> 50:55.172
In news from our nation's capital,
a group of Alzheimer's disease sufferers...

50:55.251 --> 50:58.709
marched on Washington today
demanding a cure for pancakes.

51:02.625 --> 51:08.154
<i>Until this teakettle is cured...</i>

51:08.230 --> 51:12.758
there will never be enough
bread in the laundry!

51:12.835 --> 51:14.598
<i>Ding-dong!</i>

51:14.670 --> 51:17.104

51:17.173 --> 51:19.368

51:28.918 --> 51:31.352
<i>Hi. I'm Michael Bolton.</i>

51:31.420 --> 51:33.354
Did you know that all over
the world...

51:33.422 --> 51:36.186
there are millions of children
living in extreme poverty?

51:36.258 --> 51:40.354
For more than 40 years, the What About
the Children Foundation has been making...

51:40.429 --> 51:44.024
a difference in the lives of
kids throughout the third world.

51:44.100 --> 51:46.034
And so can you...

51:46.102 --> 51:48.627
by adopting a What About
the Children sponsor child.

51:48.704 --> 51:51.730
But don't take my word for it.
Take Dibo's.

51:51.807 --> 51:54.401
Hello. I am Dibo.

51:54.477 --> 51:57.446
<i>- Come.
- Thanks to What About the Children...</i>

51:57.513 --> 52:00.812
<i>Dibo has seen his standard
of living soar well above the level...</i>

52:00.883 --> 52:03.317
<i>of his pathetic
poverty-stricken village.</i>

52:03.386 --> 52:05.286
<i>The What About The Children Foundation...</i>

52:05.354 --> 52:07.652
<i>is able to provide

52:40.689 --> 52:45.023
Thank goodness the McCormicks sent me
a security system to keep these animals out.

52:45.094 --> 52:49.030
Thank you, Dibo. It's stories like yours
that make it all worthwhile.

52:51.700 --> 52:56.228
In breaking news, we now join
Dana Dobbs in Lake Shore Bluff...

52:56.305 --> 53:00.435
where a verdict has just been handed down
in the Timothy Shanahan trial.

53:00.509 --> 53:03.205
Dana, what's the latest
on the situation?

53:03.279 --> 53:05.213
Well, Norm, as you can see...

53:05.281 --> 53:07.215
I'm here outside the First
District Federal Courthouse...

53:07.283 --> 53:11.982
where this angry mob of Negroes
is rioting over the guilty verdict...

53:12.054 --> 53:14.022
in the Timothy Shanahan case.

53:20.229 --> 53:22.697
We will keep you posted.

53:22.765 --> 53:25.029
- Thanks, Dana.
- Thank you, Norm.

53:25.101 --> 53:28.036
Those crazy Negroes.

53:28.104 --> 53:30.902
# Oh, when you love me right up front
You know that I don't mind #

53:30.973 --> 53:32.964
Enter.

53:33.042 --> 53:34.976
Pardon me, General.
Your meeting is about to start.

53:35.044 --> 53:36.978
- #Take me from behind #
- Yeah.

53:37.046 --> 53:42.211
So, as you can see, generals, Deathco
Amalgamated's M-47 "Jumpin' Johnny" land mine...

53:42.284 --> 53:48.245
earned a triple-A rating in field trials
and boasts a 98% kill-through ratio...

53:48.324 --> 53:52.420
making it the best land mine
for the government's dollar.

53:59.468 --> 54:01.902
Nah, we're gonna pass.

54:01.971 --> 54:03.905
Thanks anyway.

54:53.222 --> 54:55.156
Fuck!

54:56.392 --> 54:58.826
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

54:58.894 --> 55:03.854
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

Fuck, fuck!

55:08.337 --> 55:10.464
<i>You call yourself a salesman?</i>

55:10.539 --> 55:14.771
We spent $400 billion of the company's money
developing these land mines for the military!

55:14.843 --> 55:17.437
You'd better find a way
to unload these things!

55:17.513 --> 55:20.038
<i>Tired of backbreaking yard work?</i>

55:20.115 --> 55:23.346

Get Jumpin' Johnny today!</i>

55:41.904 --> 55:46.136
It's now time for our weekly
Inspirational Portrait.

55:47.142 --> 55:50.543
<i>This week, the Brendan Laroux story.</i>

55:50.613 --> 55:53.878
<i>Brendan Laroux's story is one of dreams.</i>

55:53.949 --> 55:57.112
<i>As a young boy,
he wanted to become a dancer...</i>

55:57.186 --> 55:59.950
<i>but at the age of 12,
he lost his legs.</i>

56:00.022 --> 56:02.354
<i>Now, this would be a setback
for any youngster...</i>

56:02.424 --> 56:06.292
<i>but not Brendan, who set
his eyes on being a surgeon...</i>

56:06.362 --> 56:09.763
<i>until, at age 14,
he lost his wrists.</i>

56:09.832 --> 56:14.064
<i>Without my wrists, there was nothing
to keep my hands attached to my arms.</i>

56:14.136 --> 56:18.869
So, even though my hands were fine,
l- I lost them too.

56:18.941 --> 56:23.503
Now, Brendan may not have had as many
hands and legs as the other boys...

56:23.579 --> 56:26.241
<i>but there was one dream
he didn't let go of-</i>

56:26.315 --> 56:28.249
<i>becoming a professional
hockey player.</i>

56:30.386 --> 56:33.253
<i>At first, the other players
treated him fairly.</i>

56:33.322 --> 56:37.315
<i>But after seeing all the attention that
Brendan was getting, they became jealous.</i>

56:37.393 --> 56:41.762
<i>The special treatment stopped. Brendan
toughed it out in the minors for two brutal years.</i>

56:41.830 --> 56:44.765
<i>But it all paid off when
he finally got the call.</i>

56:44.833 --> 56:49.202
<i>The coach said,
"How would you like to be pro hockey's...</i>

56:49.271 --> 56:53.298
first legless, handless player?"

56:53.375 --> 56:58.312
<i>It was an inspiring night, full of inspiration.</i>

56:58.380 --> 57:01.941
<i>But then, two days later...</i>

57:02.017 --> 57:05.077
<i>Brendan found out that
his rib cage was backwards...</i>

57:05.154 --> 57:09.614
<i>leaving his spine exposed, and that
he needed a complete muscle transplant.</i>

57:09.692 --> 57:12.525
<i>The risky surgery lasted 720 hours.</i>

57:12.594 --> 57:14.562
<i>Brendan came back better than ever.</i>

57:19.268 --> 57:23.102
<i>Brendan persevered
and was selected M. V.P.</i>

57:23.172 --> 57:28.542
<i>Just when it seemed like the dark clouds
had finally passed, Brendan contracted scurvy...</i>

57:28.610 --> 57:32.671
<i>went bankrupt,
and his wife was eaten by wolves.</i>

57:32.748 --> 57:35.546
<i>He was also molested
by his Uncle Jerry.</i>

57:35.617 --> 57:39.383
<i>Today, Brendan's journey
has opened the door for many athletes...</i>

57:39.455 --> 57:41.582
<i>who never would have
been given a chance...</i>

57:41.657 --> 57:46.185
<i>if he hadn't broken down
pro sports' physical ability barrier.</i>

57:46.261 --> 57:50.527
Athletes like Emma Heathcoat,
cerebral-palsy sufferer...

57:50.599 --> 57:53.227
<i>and three-time national
equestrian champ.</i>

57:56.071 --> 57:59.563
<i>Blind stockcar driver,
Bobby Templeton.</i>

58:05.147 --> 58:07.809
<i>Deaf Olympic sprinter Craig Connors.</i>

58:12.688 --> 58:16.852
<i>Gil Sarinen, the world's first
professional comatose diver...</i>

58:21.497 --> 58:25.194
<i>and, of course, Chicago
shooting guard Herbie Cohn...</i>

58:26.201 --> 58:28.965
<i>who was born with Judaism.</i>

58:37.980 --> 58:42.917
<i>Yes, none of it would have
been possible without Brendan Laroux...</i>

58:42.985 --> 58:46.477
<i>a true Inspirational Portrait.</i>

58:47.856 --> 58:50.381
In adult entertainment
industry news...

58:50.459 --> 58:53.553
the nation's porn stars
gathered today in Los Angeles...

58:53.629 --> 58:58.362
<i>in a unified demand for stronger,
more intense sexual intercourse.</i>

58:58.434 --> 59:00.197
Fuck me with your big cock!

59:00.269 --> 59:03.295
- Give it to me harder!
- Fuck me till I explode!

59:04.573 --> 59:09.306
Calling the tragedy a terrible,
unintentional mistake...

59:09.378 --> 59:12.643
the Los Angeles Police Department
issued an apology today...

59:12.714 --> 59:15.274
for the accidental shooting, clubbing...

59:15.350 --> 59:19.753
stabbing, firebombing, choking,
impaling, electrocution...

59:19.822 --> 59:23.349
and lethal-injection death
of an African-American man.

59:24.626 --> 59:27.220
<i>I'm Kip Kendall reporting
for the Onion News.</i>

59:27.296 --> 59:31.596
<i>- As the conflict between Sloravia
and Azmenistan deepens...</i>

59:31.667 --> 59:36.695
college campuses across this country
have become a hotbed of political activity.

59:36.772 --> 59:40.401
We're here in Santa Cruz, California today.
Let's listen in.

59:40.476 --> 59:43.934
Stop the violence.

59:44.012 --> 59:46.003
Stop the violence!

59:46.081 --> 59:49.209
<i>Increase the peace!</i>

59:50.819 --> 59:54.721
For the past three years,
Sloravia and Azmenistan...

59:54.790 --> 59:58.157
they've been locked in
a pointless and bloody war.

59:58.227 --> 01:00:02.027
Their cowardly leaders send
innocent young men into battle to die.

01:00:04.333 --> 01:00:06.733
Well, you know what?

01:00:06.802 --> 01:00:10.602
We need to put those leaders
in a room and let them fight it out!

01:00:14.209 --> 01:00:19.010
And you know what else? What these countries
need to do, what they need to do-

01:00:19.081 --> 01:00:22.881
<i>- Th-They need to listen to
their women a little more.</i>

01:00:22.951 --> 01:00:28.912
Because women create life,
while men, they destroy it.

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:32.887
<i>So, let's all stand up against
the corporate war machine...</i>

01:00:32.961 --> 01:00:36.795
that only exists to do
the imperialist agenda...

01:00:36.865 --> 01:00:39.834
against the- the oppressed minority.

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:41.836
Right?

01:00:45.007 --> 01:00:49.603
Love your brother! Peace! One love.

01:00:56.985 --> 01:00:59.078
<i>- Excuse me, Chad.
- 'Sup?</i>

01:00:59.154 --> 01:01:03.989
We're with the U.N.
And let me just say, we are very impressed.

01:01:04.059 --> 01:01:07.085
What you said up there
was dead on, Chad. Dead on.

01:01:07.162 --> 01:01:08.493
What?

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:12.796
We want you to negotiate talks
between Sloravia and Azmenistan.

01:01:13.869 --> 01:01:15.860
Shut up, dude.

01:01:15.938 --> 01:01:19.430
We're convinced you are the man who can
finally bring peace to this troubled region.

01:01:20.842 --> 01:01:26.007
Will you do it, Chad?
Will you help us increase the peace?

01:01:28.884 --> 01:01:32.285
- Fuck, yeah! Fuck, yeah, dude. I'm in!
- Great.

01:01:32.354 --> 01:01:34.822
- Would you come with me, please?
- Yeah.

01:01:40.295 --> 01:01:43.458
<i>Your systematic campaign of aggression...</i>

01:01:43.532 --> 01:01:46.330
against my country is the reason-

01:01:46.401 --> 01:01:51.998
Our military operations are purely
in response to your violation of the treaty.

01:01:52.074 --> 01:01:54.838
<i>- You are the one to violate the peace treaty!
- We?</i>

01:02:00.048 --> 01:02:01.982
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys.

01:02:02.050 --> 01:02:05.213
Guys, chill, chill.
Let's take a chill pill here.

01:02:09.224 --> 01:02:15.185
Don't you guys realize that war, no matter
how justified it may seem, it's not the answer.

01:02:16.932 --> 01:02:18.923
It's not?

01:02:20.202 --> 01:02:24.229
No, man.
Love is the answer.

01:02:28.343 --> 01:02:33.440
Now, let's get
this peace shit started.

01:02:41.923 --> 01:02:46.019
<i># A baby's born

01:02:46.094 --> 01:02:50.030

In international news...

01:04:07.809 --> 01:04:11.472
the crisis between Sloravia and Azmenistan
deepened today...

01:04:11.546 --> 01:04:14.709
when the leaders of
the two rival nations-

01:04:27.696 --> 01:04:32.690
Tomorrow is the deadline for Sloravia
to pull out of the Uzbagiyak region.

01:04:32.768 --> 01:04:38.502
- If it's not our lead story,
consider it my resignation.

01:04:41.443 --> 01:04:43.377
<i>Cockpuncher mania.</i>

01:04:57.993 --> 01:04:59.927
Two minutes, Norm.

01:06:14.369 --> 01:06:18.237
<i>And now, the Onion News,
America's finest news source.</i>

01:06:18.306 --> 01:06:19.603
Honey, it's about to start.

- and award-winning anchor, Norm Archer.
- Good evening.

01:06:38.159 --> 01:06:42.892
For the past 27 years,
I've sat at this desk...

01:06:42.964 --> 01:06:44.955
dedicating myself to one thing-

01:06:45.033 --> 01:06:48.662
delivering the news to you,
the American viewing public...

01:06:48.737 --> 01:06:52.537
in the most fair, balanced,
serious way possible.

01:06:52.607 --> 01:06:54.268
What's he doing?

01:06:54.342 --> 01:06:56.970
Well, things are changing
in the news game...

01:06:57.045 --> 01:06:59.843
and I've been under pressure
to change with them.

01:06:59.915 --> 01:07:04.716
<i>The powers that be at this network
have done everything they can...</i>

01:07:04.786 --> 01:07:06.879
to get me to compromise my values.

01:07:06.955 --> 01:07:08.718
So what do they want me to do?

01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:11.224
Plug our parent company's movies...

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:14.319
and other products like
a two-bit network news whore.

01:07:14.396 --> 01:07:16.023
Motherfucker.

01:07:16.097 --> 01:07:21.558
Well, I've been giving this
whole ugly business a lot of thought...

01:07:21.636 --> 01:07:24.605
and just a few moments
before going on the air tonight...

01:07:24.673 --> 01:07:26.971
I finally came to a conclusion.

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:30.068
And that conclusion is-

01:07:30.145 --> 01:07:33.672
<i>Nobody move
or the anchor infidel dies!</i>

01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:38.246

We shit on your country!
And piss also!

01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:52.598
That was good.
Tonight, on live television...

01:07:52.667 --> 01:07:58.105
<i>the American people will watch
this great spreader of Western lies...</i>

01:07:58.173 --> 01:08:01.006
get blown to pieces...

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:06.104
unless the United States government
formally apologizes...

01:08:06.181 --> 01:08:09.378
for its rotting, immoral culture.

01:08:09.451 --> 01:08:11.578
Like that's gonna happen.

01:08:11.653 --> 01:08:15.214
Are you listening, Mr. President?

01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:19.249
- We might be fucked, sir.
- We will do it.

01:08:19.327 --> 01:08:23.559

01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:25.564
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

01:08:28.603 --> 01:08:30.537
I don't think you have the balls.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.102
Cockpuncher!

01:08:33.174 --> 01:08:37.133

puncher of cocks.

<i>I'm hungry.</i>

01:08:44.551 --> 01:08:49.080
I could sure go for a sundae
topped with... crushed nuts.

01:08:49.157 --> 01:08:53.059
Yummy.

01:08:53.127 --> 01:08:56.825
Cockpuncher!
Fuck him up!

01:09:10.345 --> 01:09:11.334
Come on!

01:09:16.216 --> 01:09:19.413
I believe you'll be
releasing Norm now.

01:09:19.487 --> 01:09:23.082
Not so fast, Cockpuncher.

01:09:25.727 --> 01:09:28.287
Cock blocked.

01:09:30.165 --> 01:09:35.102
Those clever terrorists.
They blocked their cocks.

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:37.832
<i>Maybe I can be of some assistance.</i>

01:09:37.906 --> 01:09:40.466

01:10:06.434 --> 01:10:08.629
Think unsexy thoughts.
Think unsexy thoughts.

01:10:08.703 --> 01:10:11.228
Think unsexy thoughts.

01:10:22.951 --> 01:10:28.890
Enough! Your immoral Western sexuality
will not work on us.

01:10:28.957 --> 01:10:33.291
Mr. President, the time has come to
give in to our demands.

01:10:33.361 --> 01:10:38.492
If we do not hear from you in 10 seconds,
we will kill everyone in this studio.

01:10:39.567 --> 01:10:41.091
We might be fucked, sir.

01:10:41.169 --> 01:10:45.105
Ten, nine, eight...

01:10:45.173 --> 01:10:47.232
seven, six...

01:10:47.308 --> 01:10:52.940

Fuckin'-A, man.
That's some cool shit, man...

01:12:25.073 --> 01:12:27.132
You know what?

01:12:30.578 --> 01:12:33.308
You are absolutely
right, Cockpuncher.

01:12:33.381 --> 01:12:36.873
Violence is not the answer.

01:12:36.951 --> 01:12:41.820
<i>Terrorism never solved anything.
To hell with terrorism.</i>

01:12:41.889 --> 01:12:43.652
Yeah! Yeah.

01:12:43.725 --> 01:12:47.661
I'm sick and tired of
living in a fucking cave.

01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:52.124
I'm sick of doing nothing
but cursing the West all day.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.830
Jesus H. Allah!
I like the West!

01:12:56.904 --> 01:12:59.031

But most of all...

01:13:08.883 --> 01:13:14.378
I like this big-budget
blockbuster action hero.

01:13:14.455 --> 01:13:18.255

01:13:26.601 --> 01:13:30.628
Hey, Norm. Some crazy shit, huh?

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.337
Look, with all due respect,
we just wanted to ask, um...

01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:38.436
what were you gonna say
during your speech?

01:13:38.513 --> 01:13:42.677
Yeah, we were wondering what
the conclusion that you came to was.

01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:46.208
Well, I was going to say, " I'm mad as hell
and not going to take it anymore."

01:13:46.287 --> 01:13:48.221
- But after what just happened...
- Shh.

01:13:48.289 --> 01:13:50.519
I think I've learned a little lesson
I won't soon forget.

01:13:50.591 --> 01:13:56.359
As a matter of fact, I think we've all learned
a few things in the past 90 minutes.

01:13:57.965 --> 01:14:00.957
We've learned that Irishmen
have huge nipples.

01:14:01.035 --> 01:14:05.267
We've learned that film-critic intellectuals
are a bunch of gaywads.

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:08.104
And, most of all, we've learned...

01:14:08.176 --> 01:14:12.579
that creeping corporate
influence over the news...

01:14:12.647 --> 01:14:14.808
protects us from terrorism.

01:14:19.187 --> 01:14:23.817
<i>Hey, everybody, we're all gonna get laid!</i>

01:14:41.809 --> 01:14:43.743
Um, I can't help but think...

01:14:43.811 --> 01:14:48.407
it must have taken a lot of courage
to make such a provocative film.

01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:52.146
And joining us
to discuss just that...

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:55.451
<i>is the man who green-lit the film.</i>

01:14:55.523 --> 01:14:57.616
Thanks, Kenneth.
Pleasure to be here.

01:14:57.692 --> 01:15:03.562
So, uh, now, while you gave the makers
of this film tremendous leeway, obviously...

01:15:03.631 --> 01:15:06.361
still, there was some material
that you simply refused to allow?

01:15:06.434 --> 01:15:08.368
That's true.

01:15:08.436 --> 01:15:11.894
Basically, as committed as I was to letting
these guys be free to do their thing...

01:15:11.973 --> 01:15:15.841
there were simply some images
that I just didn't feel comfortable with.

01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:18.504
Mm-hmm. But I understand
you did bring some clips.

01:15:18.579 --> 01:15:22.140
That's right. Uh, I would like to show
some special bonus material.

01:15:22.216 --> 01:15:24.878
These are scenes that didn't
make it into the movie.

01:15:24.952 --> 01:15:27.887
Great. Let's take a look.

01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:45.430
So what we do is we get the kitty...

01:15:45.506 --> 01:15:47.940
and we put it in
a simple egg batter.

01:15:48.009 --> 01:15:50.978
Careful. Okay. Shh. That's fine.

01:15:51.045 --> 01:15:52.979
And then we just simply roll it around...

01:15:53.047 --> 01:15:54.981
making sure we cover
the whole thing.

01:15:55.049 --> 01:15:57.244
It's all right, baby. It's okay.

01:15:57.318 --> 01:16:00.617
Get him completely covered in
an her bed bread-crumb batter here.

01:16:00.688 --> 01:16:02.622
I see. Okay. Oh!

01:16:02.690 --> 01:16:05.523
Thank you.
And into- Oh- into the canola oil.

01:16:07.261 --> 01:16:10.924
