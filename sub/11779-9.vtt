EPISODE OF <i> INK MASTER,</i>

00:04.045 --> 00:06.756
EIGHT ARTISTS WERE LEFT
IN THE COMPETITION.

00:06.840 --> 00:07.882
- [bleep] YOU, DUDE.
YOU LITTLE BITCH.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.759
- WELL, LISTEN, MOTHER[bleep],
WHATEVER YOU WANT--

00:09.843 --> 00:11.094
- MOTHER[bleep]?

00:11.177 --> 00:12.262
- COME ON.
- SLOW DOWN.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.472
- KYLE.
- GET THE [bleep] OFF ME.

00:15.473 --> 00:17.308
THIS IS STUPID.

00:17.392 --> 00:19.686
YOU'RE FIGHTING OVER A TATTOO?

00:19.769 --> 00:22.814
- KYLE IS NOT COMING BACK.

00:22.897 --> 00:24.607
narrator:
IN THE FLASH CHALLENGE,

00:24.691 --> 00:27.026
HALO SET HIS SIGHTS
ON TAKING DOWN SAUSAGE.

00:27.110 --> 00:31.281
- SAUSAGE, MAN,
YOU GOT TO PLAY BY YOURSELF.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.198
- [chuckles]

00:32.281 --> 00:34.284
- I HAVE BEEN NICE AS [bleep]
TO YOU.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.202
- THE POINT WASN'T TO SCREW YOU.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.829
- BULL[bleep].

00:37.912 --> 00:39.914
narrator:
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO...

00:39.998 --> 00:40.874
- LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR.

00:40.957 --> 00:41.958
THIS IS GOING ON MY BODY.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.461
I DO NOT CARE
IF YOU GO HOME.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.297
narrator: THE PLAN TO TAKE DOWN
SAUSAGE BACKFIRED.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.049
- IF THIS WOULD'VE BEEN A CANVAS
FOR ANYBODY ELSE,

00:50.133 --> 00:51.301
THEY WOULD'VE [bleep]
GOT MURDERED.

00:51.384 --> 00:54.512
- SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST,
THAT'S THE [bleep] GAME, BRO.

00:54.596 --> 00:58.183
- THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY
GOES TO SAUSAGE.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.977
- SAUSAGE,
YOU SLIPPERY LITTLE WIENER.

01:01.060 --> 01:04.688
narrator: IN THE ELIMINATION,
MELISSA, LYDIA, AND HALO

01:04.772 --> 01:05.315
WERE THE BOTTOM THREE.

01:05.397 --> 01:07.484
- LYDIA.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.319
- THESE STRIPES COMING DOWN
FROM THE TOP TEETH,

01:09.402 --> 01:11.029
WHAT EFFECT
ARE WE GOING FOR THERE?

01:11.112 --> 01:11.988
- DROOL.

01:12.071 --> 01:13.114
- OH, IT'S DROOL?

01:13.198 --> 01:14.073
- MELISSA.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.074
- HE DIDN'T WANT EARS.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.326
HE DIDN'T WANT HORNS.

01:16.409 --> 01:16.618
- IT'S THE ANGRY TURTLE.

01:16.701 --> 01:18.328
- WHAT?

01:18.411 --> 01:20.038
- HALO.
- THIS IS A WEAK TATTOO.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.582
IT'S DEFINITELY A NOTCH DOWN
FROM WHAT WE EXPECTED.

01:22.665 --> 01:23.792
- I LOVE THAT PIECE.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.878
- IT DEFINITELY IS THE ODDEST,
WEIRDEST ONE OF THE BUNCH.

01:26.961 --> 01:30.089
- LYDIA, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

01:30.882 --> 01:33.718
narrator: SIX ARTISTS REMAIN,

01:33.802 --> 01:37.972
BUT ONLY ONE
WILL EARN A $100,000 PRIZE

01:38.056 --> 01:40.850
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

{\an8}[rock music]

01:43.978 --> 01:52.070
{\an8}♪ ♪

02:36.739 --> 02:38.741
- SAUSAGE IS ON EDGE.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.076
HE'S RUNNING ON EMPTY
RIGHT NOW, DUDE.

02:40.159 --> 02:41.369
- HE DID GOOD
WITH THE LAST ONE.

02:41.452 --> 02:42.620
- THAT THING WORE HIM OUT.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.081
- IF THIS WOULD'VE BEEN A CANVAS
FOR ANYBODY ELSE,

02:45.164 --> 02:46.624
THEY WOULD'VE [bleep]
GOT MURDERED.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.376
I THINK BEING THROWN
UNDER THE BUS LIKE THAT

02:48.459 --> 02:50.128
IS A SLAP IN THE FACE.

02:50.211 --> 02:51.504
- I'M NOT GONNA
HAND YOU A PIECE

02:51.588 --> 02:53.173
THAT YOU'RE GONNA [bleep] WIN
TATTOO OF THE DAY WITH.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.925
- SO THIS IS HOW
THE GAME IS GONNA BE PLAYED?

02:56.009 --> 02:59.429
- SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST,
THAT'S THE [bleep] GAME, BRO.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.431
HE'S MAKING IT PERSONAL,
DUDE.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.725
WHENEVER I WIN,
IT REALLY BUGS HIM.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.685
SO IF I WIN
A FLASH CHALLENGE,

03:05.768 --> 03:07.145
I GOT TO GIVE HIM
A BAD SKULL.

03:07.228 --> 03:08.313
- HE'LL JUST LOSE IT, DUDE.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.272
- THAT'S LIKE AN OPEN PUNCH...

03:09.355 --> 03:10.523
- YEAH.
- RIGHT IN HIS FACE.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.442
IT'S JUST GONNA MAKE HIM
EVEN MORE EMOTIONAL.

03:12.525 --> 03:13.693
IT'S GONNA MAKE HIM
MORE FRUSTRATED.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.028
AND THAT'S GONNA SHOW
IN HIS WORK.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.779
- THAT'LL [bleep] HIM UP.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.615
I COULD USE HIM
OUT OF MY WAY TOO, MAN.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.824
IF SAUSAGE
IS OUT OF THE PICTURE,

03:19.908 --> 03:20.950
THAT PUTS ME
ONE LITTLE NOTCH HIGHER.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.202
- THINK I'M GONNA PUT
THAT WIENER IN THE MICROWAVE

03:23.286 --> 03:23.870
AND JUST WATCH HIM BLOW,
DUDE.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.456
LIKE, ONE MORE BAD SKULL...

03:26.539 --> 03:27.582
- TOTALLY, LET'S DO IT.

03:27.665 --> 03:28.249
- SQUASH THAT WIENER.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.098
- OOH, WOW.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.850
- [laughs]

03:45.934 --> 03:48.186
- WHOA.
THIS IS SWEET.

03:48.269 --> 03:50.313
- I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO PUNCH SOMETHING FOR WEEKS.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.606
- I'M GONNA BEAT YOUR ASS.

03:51.689 --> 03:53.608
I HOPE THAT
WE'RE PUTTING ON GLOVES.

03:53.691 --> 03:54.317
{\an8}I WOULD PUT SAUSAGE
IN THAT RING

03:54.400 --> 03:56.945
{\an8}AND JUST SPANK HIM RIGHT NOW.

03:57.028 --> 03:57.737
- WELCOME.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.197
EVERY ONE OF YOU
HAS FOUGHT HARD

03:59.280 --> 04:00.531
TO STAY IN THIS COMPETITION.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.951
BUT ONLY ONE OF YOU
WILL WALK AWAY WITH $100,000

04:03.034 --> 04:05.495
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.498
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING DETAIL.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.000
{\an8}- DETAIL IS ESSENTIALLY
JUST USING

04:11.084 --> 04:14.629
{\an8}REALLY SMALL, FINE LINES
AND DOING ALL THE LITTLE THINGS

04:14.712 --> 04:17.130
{\an8}THAT REALLY GIVE
A PIECE OF ART THAT EXTRA POP.

04:17.214 --> 04:18.966
- YEAH.
I LOVE DETAIL.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.551
DETAIL IS WHAT I'M KNOWN FOR.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.178
- TODAY WE HAVE
A VERY SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.473
HE'S A FORMER
WORLD BOXING ASSOCIATION

04:25.556 --> 04:27.350
LIGHTWEIGHT CHAMPION.

04:27.433 --> 04:28.518
BRANDON RIOS.

04:28.601 --> 04:29.894
- YEAH!
- OH!

04:29.978 --> 04:32.522
[applause]

04:32.605 --> 04:36.109
{\an8}- BRANDON RIOS BEATS PEOPLE UP
AND GETS PAID.

04:36.192 --> 04:39.028
{\an8}- THIS GUY IS AMAZING.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.281
{\an8}- WHEN I'M IN THE RING,
I LOVE SHOWING OFF MY INK.

04:41.364 --> 04:44.784
IT'S TWO PUNCH, AND YOU'RE OUT--
BAM BAM.

04:44.867 --> 04:45.952
- THANKS FOR JOINING US TODAY,
MAN.

04:46.035 --> 04:46.869
- THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.162
- NORMALLY,
BOXERS WEAR MOUTH GUARDS

04:48.246 --> 04:50.415
FOR PROTECTION
WHEN THEY FIGHT.

04:50.498 --> 04:54.043
BUT TODAY YOU MUST CREATE
A ONE-OF-A-KIND ACCESSORY

04:54.127 --> 04:55.211
TO TAKE THE PLACE
OF THAT MOUTH GUARD

04:55.294 --> 04:58.214
WHEN BRANDON
IS NOT IN THE RING:

04:58.298 --> 05:01.217
A CUSTOM MOUTH GRILL.

05:01.300 --> 05:02.635
- A CUSTOM WHAT?

05:02.719 --> 05:04.929
- GRILLS BECAME THE LOOK
OF CHOICE FOR HIP-HOP ARTISTS

05:05.013 --> 05:07.056
AS A SYMBOL OF MONEY
AND SUCCESS.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.558
{\an8}- I'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN
A GRILL.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.436
I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE AT ALL.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.146
- THE WINNER
OF TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE

05:13.229 --> 05:15.314
WILL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL THE HUMAN CANVASES

05:15.398 --> 05:17.150
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

05:17.233 --> 05:20.153
YOU WILL HAVE 60 MINUTES
TO ENGRAVE A DESIGN

05:20.236 --> 05:22.905
USING INTRICATE DETAIL
TO CREATE A CUSTOM GRILL

05:22.989 --> 05:25.158
FOR BRANDON RIOS,

05:25.241 --> 05:28.578
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.086
- WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE
SIX-LETTER WORD?

05:37.170 --> 05:38.171
- BAM BAM.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.380
THAT'S MY RING NAME.

05:39.464 --> 05:40.548
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

05:40.631 --> 05:40.923
- WHAT ELSE MEANS A LOT TO YOU?

05:41.007 --> 05:42.759
- FIGHTING.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.093
YOU KNOW,
MY KIDS MEANS A LOT TO ME.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.095
- INITIALS?
- IF YOU WANT.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.930
{\an8}- I'M GONNA USE
AS MANY OF THE SMALL DETAILS

05:48.014 --> 05:49.724
{\an8}FROM BRANDON'S LIFE
TO KNOCK THIS DESIGN

05:49.807 --> 05:52.351
{\an8}OUT OF THE PARK
AND GET ANOTHER WIN.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.480
{\an8}- WE'RE DOWN TO THE FINAL SIX,

05:55.563 --> 05:58.524
{\an8}AND WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A REALLY TIGHT COMPETITION.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.985
{\an8}TODAY I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR DETAILS THAT ARE SOLID

06:01.069 --> 06:02.653
{\an8}AND LEGIBLE,
CLEAN AS POSSIBLE.

06:02.737 --> 06:03.946
{\an8}- BEING IN THE BOTTOM
ON THE LAST CHALLENGE

06:04.030 --> 06:06.199
{\an8}PUTS A FIRE UNDER MY ASS

06:06.282 --> 06:09.243
{\an8}THAT I DON'T FEEL LIKE
THESE OTHER GUYS HAVE.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.079
{\an8}WHAT THE [bleep]?

06:11.162 --> 06:12.872
{\an8}YOU MIND IF I SEE YOUR TEETH
REAL FAST?

06:12.955 --> 06:14.707
{\an8}OH, SO YOU DO HAVE ONE
IN THE FRONT--

06:17.710 --> 06:18.836
{\an8}- THANKS, MAN.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.422
{\an8}I NEED TO WIN THIS FLASH
CHALLENGE IN ORDER TO BE ON TOP.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.552
{\an8}- THE COMPETITION
IS GETTING REALLY INTENSE.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.138
{\an8}IT'S REALLY GETTING DOWN
TO PERSONAL VENDETTAS.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.265
{\an8}I WOULD LOVE
TO JUST WIN THIS THING

06:31.349 --> 06:33.309
{\an8}AND PUT A POUNDING
ON LITTLE SAUSAGE.

06:33.392 --> 06:34.310
{\an8}HOW'S IT GOING, KIDDO?

06:34.393 --> 06:36.813
{\an8}- YOU'RE BLOCKING MY LIGHT,
BRO.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.482
{\an8}THE TARGET ON MY BACK IS GROWING
WITH EVERY SINGLE WIN.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.985
YOU STEAL ANY OF MY IDEAS,
I WILL KILL YOU.

06:43.069 --> 06:46.030
IF I GET A CHANCE
TO PICK SKULLS,

06:46.114 --> 06:47.615
SCOTT AND HALO
SHOULD WATCH THEIR ASS.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.992
- 30 MINUTES REMAIN.
30 MORE MINUTES.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.369
- OW.

06:51.452 --> 06:52.829
[exhales]

06:52.912 --> 06:54.914
{\an8}I'M KIND OF NERVOUS
EVEN TO TOUCH THE THING.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.874
THIS IS A VERY SMALL SURFACE

06:56.958 --> 06:59.335
AND TOOLS THAT
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH.

06:59.418 --> 07:01.295
OW.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.839
THAT IS HOT.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.841
IF YOU MESS UP,
YOU'RE SCREWED.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.760
WHY IS THIS MORE NERVE-RACKING
TO ME THAN TATTOOING?

07:10.304 --> 07:12.932
- GOT THE, LIKE--
THE AZTEC STUFF.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.308
- MM-HMM.
- THAT'S AWESOME, MAN.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.435
{\an8}- ME AND SCOTT
HAVE A COMMON GOAL NOW

07:16.519 --> 07:17.854
{\an8}TO GET TO THE FINAL THREE.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.690
{\an8}HAVING SCOTT ON MY SIDE
GIVES ME A HUGE ADVANTAGE.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.692
{\an8}- THAT IS [bleep] COOL.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.193
{\an8}- HALO AND MATTI
ARE BOTH BEING SUBMISSIVE

07:24.277 --> 07:26.696
{\an8}TO SCOTT MARSHALL'S CHARMS

07:26.779 --> 07:29.115
{\an8}INSTEAD OF REALIZING
THAT HE'S BULL[bleep] THEM,

07:29.198 --> 07:31.701
{\an8}BEING SMART ENOUGH
TO TAKE HIS ASS OUT.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.788
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT,

07:35.872 --> 07:37.874
SEVEN, SIX,

07:37.957 --> 07:41.085
FIVE, FOUR, THREE,

07:41.169 --> 07:42.628
TWO, ONE.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.672
THAT IS IT.
TIME'S UP.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.716
NO MORE ENGRAVING.

07:48.050 --> 07:48.885
{\an8}- GENTLE JAY IS PUTTING, LIKE,

07:48.968 --> 07:51.804
{\an8}ALMOST THE WHOLE WORD
ON ONE TOOTH.

07:51.888 --> 07:52.972
IT IS NOT READABLE.

07:53.055 --> 07:56.475
I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET RID OF HIS ASS.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.811
- MATTI.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.229
- I WENT
WITH THE AZTEC SYMBOLOGY

08:00.313 --> 08:01.606
TO REPRESENT STRENGTH
AND WARRIORS.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.399
- OVERALL, IT'S HARD TO TELL
WHAT'S GOING ON.

08:03.482 --> 08:06.235
NOTHING REALLY STANDS OUT
REAL VIVIDLY.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.070
AS FAR AS GETTING
SMALL, TINY DETAILS,

08:08.154 --> 08:10.781
EVERYTHING'S KIND OF
A BIG, BOLD, THICK LINE.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.200
- HALO,
I LIKE THAT YOU ADDED

08:12.283 --> 08:14.160
THE TATTOO-STYLE SCRIPT.

08:14.243 --> 08:15.745
IT ADDS A LOT OF NICE DETAIL.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.580
- IT'S LIKE YOU DID
A TATTOO ON TEETH.

08:17.663 --> 08:18.581
IT'S NICE.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.416
- THE SMALL LITTLE DETAILS
IN THE FILIGREE,

08:20.499 --> 08:22.210
THEY WON'T BE NOTICEABLE
FROM A DISTANCE,

08:22.293 --> 08:25.630
BUT THEY WILL ADD
A LITTLE GLIMMER AND BLING.

08:25.713 --> 08:26.964
- MELISSA.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.258
- I THINK THE TOOTH IS THE PART
THAT'S THROWING US ALL OFF.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.843
EVEN FROM HERE, LOOKING AT IT,
IT JUST DOESN'T READ.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.095
- THE DETAIL IN THE LETTERING
IS YOUR STRONG SUIT HERE.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.679
YOU HAVE A NICE, SOFT FLOW
TO IT.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.765
BUT EVERY LETTER
LOOKS SPACED EVENLY,

08:36.849 --> 08:38.142
AND IT'S VERY LEGIBLE.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.519
OVERALL,
IT'S A NICE USE OF DETAIL.

08:39.602 --> 08:39.894
- THANK YOU.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.020
- SAUSAGE.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.356
- I LOVE THE FACT
THAT IN THE BACK,

08:43.438 --> 08:44.941
YOU PUT MY KIDS' INITIALS
ON IT.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.943
IT'S AWESOME, BECAUSE
THEY DO MEAN A LOT TO ME.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.654
- I THINK THE MAIN DOWNFALL
IS THE "B"s THEMSELVES.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.239
ONE "B" LOOKS PRETTY CROOKED.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.490
ONE "B" LOOKS BIGGER
THAN THE OTHER.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.992
AND WE'VE SEEN A FEW
REALLY, REALLY NICE EXAMPLES

08:55.076 --> 08:56.577
OF SMOOTH, CLEAN LETTERING
TODAY.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.579
SO YOUR LETTERING
DOES FALL SHORT.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.581
- [exhales]

09:00.665 --> 09:01.457
- JAY.

09:01.540 --> 09:02.500
- THE "BAM BAM" IS NICE.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.584
I LIKE HOW IT LOOKS.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.461
BUT YOU GOT TO LOOK VERY CLOSELY
AND CAREFULLY

09:05.544 --> 09:06.545
JUST TO READ "BAM BAM."

09:06.629 --> 09:07.755
- I DON'T REALLY LIKE
THE GLOVES.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.257
THEY LOOK LIKE LITTLE TOMATOES
TO ME.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.133
- THOSE THINGS LOOK LIKE GLOVES
'CAUSE IT SAYS "BAM BAM."

09:11.217 --> 09:12.134
WHAT ELSE WOULD THEY BE?

09:12.218 --> 09:14.470
- BAM BAM.
THESE TOMATOES ARE EXPLODING.

09:14.553 --> 09:16.639
- YOU'RE CRAZY, MAN.
THIS THING IS BADASS.

09:16.722 --> 09:17.640
- THANK YOU.

09:17.723 --> 09:18.557
- SCOTT.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.393
- THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL DETAIL.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.102
YOU CAN SEE THE "BAM BAM"
PERFECT.

09:21.185 --> 09:22.436
THE DIAMOND'S AWESOME.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.064
- GREAT IDEA
TO MAKE THE TEETH GOLD.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.649
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE.
IT'S A GOLD GRILL.

09:26.732 --> 09:27.441
AND EVEN THOUGH
IT'S A VERY SMALL AREA,

09:27.525 --> 09:29.318
YOU MADE IT
SO IT'S READABLE.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.278
IF HE REALLY SMILES AT YOU,

09:30.361 --> 09:31.112
YOU CAN SEE "BAM BAM"
FROM A DISTANCE.

09:31.195 --> 09:34.073
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

09:34.156 --> 09:35.366
{\an8}- THIS IS A DETAIL CHALLENGE.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.450
SCOTT'S HAS BASIC LETTERS

09:36.534 --> 09:40.663
AND ONE TOOTH OUT OF SEVEN
THAT'S DETAILED.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.832
IT'S BULL[bleep],
STRAIGHT BULL[bleep].

09:44.542 --> 09:46.210
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
TODAY'S CHALLENGE:

09:46.294 --> 09:48.713
CREATE A CUSTOM GRILL
SHOWING DETAIL

09:48.796 --> 09:50.047
FOR THIS GENTLEMAN,
MR. BRANDON RIOS.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.341
HOW'D THEY DO OVERALL?

09:52.425 --> 09:54.760
- IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO SHOW
DETAIL IN SUCH A SMALL AREA,

09:54.844 --> 09:56.178
SOME PEOPLE
GOT A LITTLE CLUTTERED.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.555
IT MADE IT HARDER TO READ.

09:57.638 --> 10:00.224
- SAUSAGE CRAMMED SO MUCH DETAIL
IN THERE.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.976
- THE BEST PART
OF THAT WHOLE GRILL

10:02.059 --> 10:04.020
IS THE INSIDE, THAT HE PUT
THE KIDS' INITIALS.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.813
OTHER THAN THAT,
THE THING WAS A LOSS.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.524
- MATTI DID AZTEC SYMBOLS.

10:08.607 --> 10:11.319
- I DON'T REALLY THINK
THERE WAS FINE, DETAILED LINES.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.696
THE BIG SHAPES THAT HE HAD
WERE VERY SLOPPY.

10:13.779 --> 10:14.864
- SOMETIMES,
LESS IS MORE,

10:14.947 --> 10:16.699
AND JUST MAKING THESE THINGS
LEGIBLE

10:16.782 --> 10:18.034
MAKES THIS THING
COME TO LIFE.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.118
- LIKE, MELISSA'S LETTERS,

10:19.201 --> 10:19.952
EACH ACTUAL LETTER

10:20.036 --> 10:21.871
HAD SUCH A GOOD, CLEAN SHAPE
TO IT.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.581
IT REALLY WAS THE NICEST
LETTERING THAT WE SAW TODAY.

10:23.664 --> 10:26.459
- FOR ME, SHE LOST IT
ON THE TOOTH

10:26.542 --> 10:28.085
IN THE CENTER OF THE GRILL.

10:28.169 --> 10:28.753
- FOR A GUY WHO'S A FIGHTER,

10:28.836 --> 10:29.587
HE DOESN'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE

10:29.670 --> 10:31.505
HE'S GETTING
HIS TEETH KNOCKED OUT.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.049
- AND YOU COULDN'T EVEN TELL
IT WAS TEETH.

10:33.132 --> 10:33.716
IT LOOKED LIKE A WISHBONE.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.551
- SCOTT USED NEGATIVE SPACE

10:35.634 --> 10:36.761
TO CREATE HIS LETTERING.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.054
- IT'S VERY LEGIBLE.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.264
JUST HIS ATTENTION TO DETAILS
CAME OUT VERY CLEAN.

10:40.348 --> 10:41.474
- WELL, EVERYBODY WANTS
A GOLD GRILL,

10:41.557 --> 10:42.600
AND HE MADE IT A GOLD GRILL.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.894
AND EVEN THOUGH
IT WASN'T A REAL DIAMOND,

10:44.977 --> 10:46.020
IT WAS SPARKLY.

10:46.103 --> 10:47.730
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
SO I THINK WE HAVE A WINNER.

10:47.813 --> 10:48.731
DO WE ALL AGREE?

10:48.814 --> 10:49.857
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.317
- ALL RIGHT, MAN,
LET'S GO LET THEM KNOW.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.819
TODAY YOU HAD TO USE DETAIL

10:53.903 --> 10:57.406
TO CREATE A CUSTOM GRILL
FOR BRANDON RIOS.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.533
SOME OF YOU IMPRESSED US.

10:59.617 --> 11:00.576
SCOTT.

11:00.659 --> 11:02.953
- THE DETAIL IN THE DIAMOND
WAS REALLY STRONG.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.414
BUT ACTUALLY LEAVING THE TEETH
AND MAKING THEM GOLD,

11:05.498 --> 11:07.249
THAT'S REALLY WHAT JUMPS OUT
TO ME.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.501
A GOLD GRILL
IS A GOLD GRILL.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.086
AND YOU MADE IT GOLD.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.338
- MELISSA.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.673
- THIS IS REALLY,
REALLY NICE LETTERING.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.509
CREATING AN EVEN SPACE
BETWEEN EACH LETTER

11:16.592 --> 11:18.344
EVEN THOUGH THE TEETH
ARE DIFFERENT SIZES

11:18.427 --> 11:20.429
IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT,
SO VERY NICE.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.764
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED THAT

11:21.847 --> 11:25.226
THE WINNER OF TODAY'S
FLASH CHALLENGE IS...

11:28.020 --> 11:29.105
SCOTT.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.523
- THANK YOU.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.608
- I'M GONNA WEAR IT
AT MY NEXT FIGHT.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.318
AFTER I GET DONE IN THE RING,

11:34.402 --> 11:35.569
I'M GONNA TAKE OFF
MY MOUTHPIECE,

11:35.653 --> 11:36.904
PUT THE GOLD GRILL ON,

11:36.987 --> 11:38.781
AND THEN GIVE A SHOUT-OUT
TO SCOTT.

11:38.864 --> 11:39.949
- NICE, DUDE.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.117
- GOOD LUCK, MAN.
SMASH HIM.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.284
- THANK YOU.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.120
- SCOTT,
YOU'LL HAVE THE POWER

11:44.203 --> 11:46.580
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

11:46.664 --> 11:50.418
{\an8}- I CANNOT WAIT
TO STICK IT TO SAUSAGE AGAIN

11:50.501 --> 11:52.044
{\an8}AND HAND HIM A TOUGH SKULL.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.462
{\an8}I'M GONNA KEEP GUNNING
FOR HIM

11:53.546 --> 11:55.214
{\an8}TILL HE'S PACKING HIS BAGS
AND HE'S GOING HOME.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.966
{\an8}- I CAN'T GET A BREAK.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.134
{\an8}NOW I HAVE TO FACE SCOTT

11:58.217 --> 11:59.552
{\an8}HANDING OUT SKULLS
ONE MORE TIME.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.721
HE'S GONNA HAVE BULLETS
AIMING AT ME,

12:01.804 --> 12:04.140
AND I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN HANDLE
ANOTHER DIFFICULT CANVAS.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.516
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT

12:05.599 --> 12:07.935
AND PREPARE TO MEET
YOUR CANVASES

12:08.018 --> 12:09.562
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.152
{\an8}- "LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.528
{\an8}NOW I GET TO HAND OUT
SKULLS."

12:17.611 --> 12:18.529
{\an8}- I GOT A SKULL FOR YOU, MAN.

12:18.612 --> 12:19.989
{\an8}- I'M NOT [bleep] AFRAID.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.240
{\an8}- IT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT.

12:21.323 --> 12:22.825
- IT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT,
OR YOU CAN'T DO IT?

12:22.908 --> 12:24.827
- WE GOT OURSELVES A BITCH,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.954
I'M JUST GONNA WIND UP
TATTOOING MYSELF.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.795
- WHO THINKS IT WAS WEIRD

12:34.879 --> 12:36.005
THAT SCOTT WON
THE DETAIL CHALLENGE?

12:36.088 --> 12:39.258
- I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT HALO
SHOULD'VE WON IT OVER SCOTT.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.217
- WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

12:40.301 --> 12:41.760
- HIS HAD GREATER DETAIL
IN IT.

12:41.844 --> 12:42.303
- I TOOK A SIMPLISTIC APPROACH.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.680
- THEY SAID DETAIL.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.557
- IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
EVERY TIME I COME UP HERE,

12:46.640 --> 12:48.559
IF I WIN,
IT'S KIND OF LIKE,

12:48.642 --> 12:50.102
"SOMEONE ELSE SHOULD'VE WON."

12:50.186 --> 12:52.438
- WHAT, WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO FEEL THAT WAY?

12:52.521 --> 12:54.899
SCOTT IS AN EGOMANIAC.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.025
IF I CAN GET UNDER HIS SKIN,

12:56.108 --> 12:59.236
I FEEL THAT SCOTT'S
GONNA OVERTHINK HIS STRATEGY.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.696
- TO ME, IT'S JUST, LIKE,
DISRESPECTFUL AS AN ARTIST.

13:00.779 --> 13:03.324
- YOU WON.
OKAY, COOL, YOU WON.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.074
I MEAN,
IF YOU WANT TO GO AROUND

13:04.158 --> 13:04.783
AS A PROUD PEACOCK,
YOU CAN.

13:04.867 --> 13:05.576
"LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME.

13:05.659 --> 13:06.869
NOW I GET TO HAND OUT
SKULLS."

13:06.952 --> 13:08.621
BUT DON'T THINK--
- I GOT A SKULL FOR YOU, MAN.

13:08.704 --> 13:11.207
I GOT A SKULL FOR YOU.
- I KNOW YOU DO, DUDE,

13:11.290 --> 13:12.750
'CAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW IT'S BEEN EVERY SINGLE TIME.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.127
- YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SMART,
MAN, AND YOU JUST--

13:15.211 --> 13:16.086
- AND THEN YOU PLAY IT OFF AS,
"I'M PLAYING THE GAME."

13:16.170 --> 13:18.214
AND EVERYBODY ELSE--
- I AM PLAYING A GAME.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.298
- I'M NOT [bleep] AFRAID.

13:19.381 --> 13:19.965
YOU KNOW WHAT I DID
WITH THE SKULL

13:20.049 --> 13:21.550
LAST TIME YOU GAVE IT TO ME.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.844
I [bleep] KNOCKED IT
OUT OF THE PARK.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.902
- WELCOME TO
THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

13:39.985 --> 13:40.778
NAIL IT,
AND YOU'LL EARN ANOTHER WEEK

13:40.861 --> 13:45.157
TO PROVE THAT YOU DESERVE
$100,000,

13:45.241 --> 13:47.034
A FEATURE IN <i> INKED MAGAZINE,</i>

13:47.117 --> 13:48.744
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

13:48.827 --> 13:49.912
- YEAH.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.455
- YOU'LL BE JUDGED
BY OLIVER PECK, CHRIS NUNEZ,

13:51.539 --> 13:53.707
BRANDON RIOS, AND MYSELF.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.501
BUT WE'RE NOT
YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

13:55.584 --> 13:58.546
EACH WEEK, YOU'LL ALSO
BE JUDGED BY AMERICA.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.589
VIEWERS AT HOME WILL SCOUR
EVERY DETAIL

14:00.673 --> 14:04.593
OF YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOOS
AT INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM

14:04.677 --> 14:07.763
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

14:07.846 --> 14:11.100
AMERICA'S VOTE
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT

14:11.183 --> 14:12.893
AT THE LIVE FINALE.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.353
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

14:14.436 --> 14:16.188
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER
TO WIN TATTOO OF THE DAY,

14:16.272 --> 14:20.818
BECAUSE THE WINNER MUST PUT
ONE ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.987
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING DETAIL.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.029
- DETAIL TAKES
A LOT OF TIME.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.448
{\an8}IT'S INTRICATE, TINY, LITTLE,
PRECISE ACTIONS

14:26.532 --> 14:28.784
{\an8}YOU CAN PUT INTO A TATTOO

14:28.867 --> 14:31.078
{\an8}THAT REALLY JUST PUT IT
ABOVE PAR.

14:31.161 --> 14:34.707
- TODAY, YOU MUST TATTOO
A WARRIOR.

14:34.790 --> 14:35.958
- YEAH.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.127
- STRONG, FEARLESS,
AND READY FOR BATTLE,

14:38.210 --> 14:41.797
A WARRIOR IS A FIGHTER
FROM ANY TIME PERIOD OR CULTURE.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.883
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO SHOW
EXACTLY WHO YOUR WARRIOR IS--

14:44.967 --> 14:46.719
THROUGH THE DETAILS.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.887
- IF YOU DON'T PUT A LOT
OF DETAIL IN A WARRIOR TATTOO,

14:48.971 --> 14:49.888
{\an8}IT'S NOT GONNA LOOK
INTIMIDATING.

14:49.972 --> 14:53.309
IT'S NOT GONNA HAVE
THAT WARRIOR SPIRIT.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.894
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

14:59.898 --> 15:01.150
SCOTT, YOU WON
THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.486
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.946
SO CHOOSE WISELY.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.948
- I CANNOT WAIT
TO STICK IT TO SAUSAGE.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.784
AND GENTLE JAY
IS JUST [bleep] ANNOYING.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.578
I'M SICK OF HIS LOUD MOUTH,
AND I WANT HIM GONE.

15:12.661 --> 15:13.704
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
TO GET DONE?

15:13.787 --> 15:16.332
- I'M LOOKING TO GET
A SAMURAI WARRIOR ON MY BACK.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.291
{\an8}- THIS BIG?
- YEAH.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.546
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT THE SAMURAI.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.424
{\an8}THEIR ARMOR IS VERY ORNATE,
VERY DETAILED.

15:25.507 --> 15:26.717
{\an8}IT'S GONNA BE ROUGH TO FINISH.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.177
- I'M LOOKING TO GET
A VIKING WARRIOR.

15:28.260 --> 15:28.677
- AWESOME.
- I LIKE THAT.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.595
- ROMAN GLADIATOR.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.680
- WITH THE ARMOR
AND EVERYTHING?

15:31.764 --> 15:33.223
{\an8}- YES.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.475
{\an8}- WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING
TO GET DONE?

15:34.558 --> 15:37.394
{\an8}- A NATIVE AMERICAN
WARRIOR WOMAN ON MY RIBS.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.147
{\an8}- IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

15:40.230 --> 15:42.274
{\an8}TO SHOW A LOT OF DETAIL
ON A RIB CAGE.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.400
{\an8}IT'S A SENSITIVE AREA.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.360
{\an8}THIS WOULD BE
A VERY TOUGH PIECE.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.237
{\an8}- AZTEC FEMALE WARRIOR
ON MY RIGHT FOREARM.

15:59.583 --> 16:00.751
- SCOTT'S MY BOY.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.211
I KNOW THAT
HE'S GONNA HOOK ME UP.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.589
{\an8}SO I'M JUST MORE INTERESTED
IN WHO HE IS GONNA SCREW.

16:05.673 --> 16:06.548
{\an8}- HE'S GUNNING
FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE NOW,

16:06.632 --> 16:08.509
{\an8}AND I'M ONE OF THEM.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.179
{\an8}- SCOTT'S GONNA HAND OUT SKULLS

16:12.262 --> 16:13.722
{\an8}THE WAY HE ALWAYS
HANDS OUT SKULLS.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.433
{\an8}HE'S GONNA HAVE BULLETS
AIMING AT ME.

16:16.975 --> 16:18.185
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

16:18.268 --> 16:21.605
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.565
- MATTI.

16:23.649 --> 16:24.900
- HALO.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.154
- SCOTT.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.364
- OH.

16:30.447 --> 16:33.450
{\an8}- AT LEAST
HE'S NOT PREDICTABLE.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.618
- MELISSA.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.215
- SAUSAGE.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.511
- GENTLE JAY.

16:52.594 --> 16:55.305
- GOOD LUCK, JAY.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.558
- REMEMBER, GUYS,
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

16:57.641 --> 17:00.269
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO

17:00.352 --> 17:01.812
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST

17:01.895 --> 17:04.272
AND PUT ONE OF YOU
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.023
AND THE WINNER
OF TATTOO OF THE DAY

17:06.108 --> 17:08.609
WILL ALSO PUT ONE OF YOU
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.363
YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO A FIERCE WARRIOR.

17:11.446 --> 17:12.698
AND BASED ON YOUR WORK,

17:12.781 --> 17:14.324
ONE OF YOU
WILL BE CLOSING SHOP.

17:14.407 --> 17:16.242
GOOD LUCK.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.082
{\an8}- SMALL DETAILS TELL THE STORY
OF WHO THESE WARRIORS ARE.

17:22.165 --> 17:24.792
WE GOT THESE DYNAMIC FIGURES
IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.962
YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE
THIS TATTOO SOME SORT OF LIFE.

17:27.045 --> 17:28.672
ALL OF THESE FINE,
LITTLE DETAILS

17:28.756 --> 17:31.049
ARE WHAT'S GONNA MAKE
YOUR TATTOO STEP AHEAD

17:31.133 --> 17:32.676
AND BE BETTER
OR FALL SHORT.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.969
- SO YOU'RE THINKING YOU WANT
TO GET A VIKING WARRIOR.

17:34.052 --> 17:36.430
- VIKING WARRIOR, YEAH.
- AWESOME.

17:36.513 --> 17:37.806
- SOMETHING BADASS, MAN.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.851
- I WANT HER TO KIND OF RESEMBLE
MY FACE JUST A LITTLE BIT.

17:40.934 --> 17:41.602
- OKAY.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.812
- I WANT A KICK-ASS TATTOO.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.314
- I JUST NEED SPECIFICS.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.149
- I WANT, LIKE, A BREASTPLATE,
LIKE A CHEST PLATE.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.318
THE HELMET WHERE, LIKE, THE NOSE
AND THE EYES ARE SHOWING.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.320
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT A SPEAR
INSTEAD OF A SWORD?

17:51.403 --> 17:54.490
- YOU GOT TO JUST TELL ME
WHICH TYPE YOU WANT.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.867
{\an8}WE GOT OURSELVES A BITCH,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.494
SCOTT WAS TRYING TO GIVE ME
A DIFFICULT ONE TO DEAL WITH.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.746
HE SUCCEEDED.

18:00.829 --> 18:02.581
- I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE
TO, LIKE, SEE HIS BICEP

18:02.664 --> 18:04.333
AND, LIKE,
HIS FOREARM AND HIS FIST.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.376
- THAT MIGHT NOT BE
ANATOMICALLY POSSIBLE.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.961
WE ALSO WANT TO FINISH
THIS THING.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.922
- THAT IS TRUE TOO,
BUT I DON'T LIKE THAT IDEA.

18:10.005 --> 18:10.923
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.382
- THAT LIMITS US.

18:12.466 --> 18:15.177
HE JUST WANTS TO FIGHT ME
AT EVERY SINGLE TURN.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.845
- YEAH, NO.
NO, I DON'T LIKE THAT MUCH.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.138
- [groans]
WHATEVER, DUDE.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.349
I DON'T CARE.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.143
THIS COULD DEFINITELY
GET ME SENT HOME.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.734
- YEAH, THAT BODY POSITION
WAS WEIRD.

18:30.818 --> 18:31.944
THE ARM WAS ALL WONKY.

18:32.027 --> 18:33.821
- I JUST DON'T GET IT.

18:33.904 --> 18:34.905
YOU TOLD ME YOU'RE NOT GONNA
CHANGE IT ON ME.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.782
YOU CHANGED THE ARM,
AND YOU CHANGED THE SHIELD.

18:36.865 --> 18:38.116
- YEAH, BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT
IT LOOKS [bleep] WEIRD.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.537
LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU NOW,
IT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.247
- IT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT,
OR YOU CAN'T DO IT?

18:43.330 --> 18:44.456
YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE?

18:44.540 --> 18:45.624
- [sighs]

18:45.707 --> 18:46.875
MY CANVAS IS AN ASS[bleep].

18:46.959 --> 18:48.627
- WHAT HAPPENED WAS,
YOU TOLD ME THIS,

18:48.710 --> 18:49.920
- NO, NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

18:50.003 --> 18:50.796
- AND YOU SAID YOU'RE NOT GONNA
ASK ME TO CHANGE IT.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.339
AND THEN YOU CHANGED IT ON ME.

18:52.422 --> 18:53.549
- I HAD TO CHANGE IT.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.050
I HAD TO CHANGE IT
FOR WHAT'S GONNA WORK.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.635
AND YOU SIGNED UP
TO GET A FREE TATTOO.

18:56.718 --> 18:57.886
- NO, I'M SUPPOSED
TO GET SOMETHING

18:57.970 --> 18:59.388
I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE HAPPY WITH.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.889
- YOU'RE GONNA GET
WHAT'S GONNA WORK

19:00.973 --> 19:02.558
FOR THE COMPETITION--
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.853
{\an8}DON'T COST ME MY OPPORTUNITY
BECAUSE YOU'RE A DICK.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.354
{\an8}YOU'RE A DICK, DUDE.

19:07.437 --> 19:08.480
- I GOT TO LIKE THIS.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.232
- BUT I GOT TO DO
WHAT'S GONNA WIN.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.359
SO I'M GONNA TRY TO DO WHAT
YOU'RE ASKING FOR RIGHT NOW.

19:12.442 --> 19:13.318
- I'M SURE YOU WILL.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.528
- BUT IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT,

19:14.611 --> 19:16.154
I'M JUST GONNA WIND UP
TATTOOING MYSELF.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.197
- THAT'S COMFORTING.

19:17.281 --> 19:17.364
{\an8}- [groans]

19:20.200 --> 19:21.577
{\an8}- IF YOU'RE GONNA TATTOO
YOURSELF,

19:21.660 --> 19:22.953
{\an8}THEN WHAT'S THE WHOLE POINT
OF THIS COMPETITION?

19:23.036 --> 19:23.996
{\an8}I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:24.079 --> 19:25.038
{\an8}IS THIS HOW YOU TREAT CUSTOMERS
IN YOUR SHOP?

19:25.122 --> 19:27.291
THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT I HAVE TO WEAR

19:27.374 --> 19:29.001
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,
FIRST AND FOREMOST.

19:29.084 --> 19:32.504
IT'S A CONTEST SECONDARY.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.674
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO A WARRIOR.

19:35.757 --> 19:39.761
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.096
- LET'S ROCK.

19:41.179 --> 19:44.099
- YOU READY TO WIN
THIS [bleep]?

19:46.935 --> 19:47.895
{\an8}- WHEN YOU'RE TATTOOING
A WARRIOR,

19:47.978 --> 19:49.730
{\an8}THERE'S A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS
YOU COULD GO.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.315
A LOT OF THE ARMOR
WAS VERY DETAILED.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.025
BATTLE WOUNDS,
FACIAL EXPRESSIONS,

19:53.108 --> 19:54.276
HAIR, BEARDS--

19:54.359 --> 19:56.445
A WARRIOR WILL ALWAYS HAVE
FINE DETAIL.

19:56.528 --> 19:59.323
{\an8}- COOL?

19:59.406 --> 20:01.074
- I THINK IT'LL DEFINITELY
GIVE HER THE IDEA

20:01.158 --> 20:02.284
OF HER BEING SEXY,

20:02.367 --> 20:04.244
THE RED THAT'S KIND OF
GOING ACROSS HERE.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.245
PRETTY COOL?

20:05.329 --> 20:06.204
- I LOVE IT.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.247
- YAY.
HIGH FIVE.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.165
- [laughs]

20:08.248 --> 20:09.458
- YOU'RE THE BEST NEWS
I'VE HAD

20:09.541 --> 20:10.459
IN A LONG TIME, SWEETIE.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.460
THAT'S--
THIS IS REFRESHING.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.211
MY CANVAS WANTED A WARRIOR
ON HER RIB CAGE.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.048
{\an8}I'M NOW TATTOOING
MY CANVAS'S RIGHT SHOULDER.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.591
WHEN IS SCOTT GONNA REALIZE

20:17.674 --> 20:19.593
THAT HE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO TAKE ME OUT?

20:19.676 --> 20:20.928
AND IF YOU DON'T THANK
ANYBODY ELSE, YOU THANK SCOTT.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.096
YEAH, YOU GO OVER THERE.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.098
YOU GO, "THANK YOU, SCOTT,
FOR BEING SO COOL."

20:25.182 --> 20:26.308
- ALL RIGHT, MAN, HERE WE GO.

20:26.391 --> 20:27.309
- ALL RIGHT.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.816
- FIVE MORE HOURS.

20:37.819 --> 20:39.071
- I'VE BEEN ON THE TOP
QUITE A BIT.

20:39.154 --> 20:41.949
SO I'M TRYING TO JUST KEEP
THAT FLOW GOING

20:42.032 --> 20:43.617
AND KEEP [bleep]
FIGHTING MY TITS OFF.

20:43.700 --> 20:44.785
- MM-HMM.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.912
- A TRUE WARRIOR HAS GOT

20:46.995 --> 20:48.246
A LOT OF DENTS AND DINGS
FROM BEING IN BATTLE,

20:48.330 --> 20:51.041
SO I PLAN ON SHOWING DETAIL
EVERYWHERE.

20:51.124 --> 20:52.668
{\an8}THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ONE PART
OF THIS TATTOO

20:52.751 --> 20:53.835
{\an8}THAT THE JUDGES ARE GONNA SAY
LACKS DETAIL.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.170
{\an8}IT'S NICE TO KNOW,

20:55.253 --> 20:57.631
{\an8}ESPECIALLY THIS LATE
IN THE GAME,

20:57.714 --> 20:59.800
{\an8}THAT I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING
THAT'S GONNA KICK ASS.

20:59.883 --> 21:02.302
{\an8}- COMPETITION'S GETTING TIGHT,

21:02.386 --> 21:04.638
{\an8}AND I REALLY NEED TO STAY
IN THE TOP.

21:04.721 --> 21:05.889
I WANT TO OUTPERFORM EVERYBODY
TODAY.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.517
- CHECK OUT WHAT MATTI'S DOING.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.518
- WHAT'S UP, DUDE?

21:09.601 --> 21:11.019
- OH, YOU GOT THE VIKING.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.312
YOU DOING A LOT OF COLOR?

21:12.396 --> 21:12.854
NO, YOU'RE DOING FULL COLOR
ON THIS THING, HUH?

21:12.938 --> 21:13.855
- YEAH, FULL COLOR.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.816
- YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.025
- I'M THE ONLY ONE DOING COLOR,

21:17.109 --> 21:18.735
AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA
GIVE ME THE EDGE.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.487
- KILLER, MAN.
WE'LL SEE YOU IN A BIT.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.075
- HIS SHIELD IS DARK.

21:25.158 --> 21:26.743
THAT'S A LOT OF DARK
IN ONE SPOT.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.537
- I CAN'T STAND THIS JERK-OFF.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.705
THERE HAS TO BE SHADOWS.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.833
IF THERE'S NO SHADOWS,
WE GOT NOTHING.

21:32.916 --> 21:33.625
- YOU DON'T THINK IT'S TOO MUCH,

21:33.709 --> 21:35.293
LIKE, BLACK IN ONE SPOT,
THOUGH?

21:38.130 --> 21:39.089
HE'S COMPLAINING.

21:39.172 --> 21:40.215
HE'S QUESTIONING
WHAT I'M DOING.

21:40.298 --> 21:41.550
{\an8}- IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S SO MUCH BLACK

21:41.633 --> 21:43.552
{\an8}GOING ON THERE IN THE ARM.

21:46.888 --> 21:49.016
I SHOULD'VE DONE

21:49.099 --> 21:50.392
WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE
IN THE REAL WORLD

21:50.475 --> 21:52.561
AND THROWN HIS ASS
THE [bleep] OUT.

21:52.644 --> 21:55.022
- COME IN HERE TO SEE
WHAT GENTLE JAY'S DOING.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.314
- WHAT'S UP?
- GENTLE JAY.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.358
- JAY'S GOT A LOT OF DETAILS
IN THIS TATTOO.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.027
{\an8}BUT HE'S ADDING
A LOT OF BACKGROUND

22:00.110 --> 22:02.362
{\an8}THAT I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE

22:02.446 --> 22:04.489
{\an8}IS GONNA HELP HIS TATTOO OUT
TOO MUCH.

22:04.573 --> 22:05.949
JUST BAD DECISIONS.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.661
- ONE MORE HOUR.

22:09.745 --> 22:10.829
FINAL HOUR.

22:21.673 --> 22:22.674
{\an8}BEING THE YOUNGEST,

22:22.758 --> 22:24.092
{\an8}I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK
THAT ANYONE

22:24.176 --> 22:25.427
{\an8}EXPECTED ME TO GET
THIS FAR.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.512
BUT I'VE JUST BEEN SHOWING
WEEK AFTER WEEK

22:27.596 --> 22:28.764
THAT I DESERVE TO BE HERE.

22:28.847 --> 22:31.516
AND NOW I'M GONNA PROVE
THAT I DESERVE TOP FIVE.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.643
- IT'S A DETAIL CHALLENGE.
- YEAH.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.438
- MORE DETAIL NEVER HURTS.

22:36.521 --> 22:36.813
- 30 MINUTES REMAINING.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.356
30 MINUTES.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.447
I'M SHOWING MY TATTOO AROUND
TO THE OTHER ARTISTS

22:45.530 --> 22:46.323
BECAUSE I'M SICK
OF BEING DISCREDITED.

22:46.406 --> 22:47.616
YOU WANT TO SEE HIM
REALLY QUICK?

22:47.699 --> 22:51.244
{\an8}I WANT THEM TO SEE MY TATTOO
SIDE BY SIDE WITH THEIR TATTOO,

22:51.328 --> 22:53.955
{\an8}SO THEY CAN SEE HOW MUCH BETTER
MY TATTOO IS THAN THEIRS.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.540
- LET ME SEE.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.042
WHEN I SEE THE SAMURAI,

22:57.125 --> 23:00.629
I REALIZE RIGHT AWAY,
I HAVE SEEN THAT BEFORE.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.840
IF SCOTT IS JUST STEALING IMAGES
AND TATTOOING THEM,

23:03.924 --> 23:06.927
HE SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

23:07.010 --> 23:10.263
- OH, MY GOD.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.896
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT,

23:17.979 --> 23:19.898
SEVEN, SIX,

23:19.981 --> 23:23.860
FIVE, FOUR, THREE,

23:23.944 --> 23:25.487
TWO, ONE.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.988
THAT'S IT.
MACHINES DOWN.

23:27.072 --> 23:27.989
TIME IS UP.

23:28.073 --> 23:28.824
NO MORE INK.

23:28.907 --> 23:29.825
- [gasps]

23:29.908 --> 23:31.660
OH, MY GOD.

23:31.743 --> 23:32.828
[gasps]

23:32.911 --> 23:35.664
SHE'S [bleep] HOT.

23:35.747 --> 23:36.957
- GREAT, MAN.
THANK YOU.

23:37.040 --> 23:37.582
BETTER THAN I COULD'VE BELIEVED.

23:40.961 --> 23:43.421
- AND TA-DA.

23:43.505 --> 23:47.425
- IT--IT JUST--
IT LOOKS A LITTLE TOO DARK.

23:47.509 --> 23:51.555
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE HIS ARM
AND THE SHIELD,

23:51.638 --> 23:53.098
IT'S JUST, LIKE--
IT'S ONE SHADE.

23:53.181 --> 23:55.100
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO, LIKE, SEE
HIS ARM A LITTLE BIT MORE.

23:55.183 --> 23:56.852
- THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT
ONE SHADE.

23:56.935 --> 23:57.811
- JAY'S INABILITY TO WORK
WITH THE CANVAS...

23:57.894 --> 24:00.063
- HOLY [bleep].

24:00.147 --> 24:01.022
- REALLY SHOWS IN HIS TATTOO.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.108
IF YOU WANT TO BE INK MASTER,

24:03.191 --> 24:04.693
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK
WITH ANY CANVAS

24:04.776 --> 24:05.902
AND STILL MAKE A GOOD TATTOO.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.028
- THE JUDGE COME OVER,

24:07.112 --> 24:10.240
TAKING A LOOK AT IT
WITH A BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE--

24:10.323 --> 24:12.409
HE DIDN'T DO THAT
'CAUSE I WAS [bleep] UP.

24:12.492 --> 24:13.869
- PACK YOUR BAGS, DUDE.
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S MISSING YOU.

24:13.952 --> 24:14.870
GO HOME.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.164
- [groans]

24:17.247 --> 24:17.873
{\an8}- SO HE'S JUST TRACING STUFF.

24:17.956 --> 24:18.874
{\an8}- HE'S TRACING.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.959
{\an8}- THAT'S NOT FAIR.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.043
- HE'S AT THE END OF HIS ROPE.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.170
- NOBODY OVER HERE
IS SCARED OF YOU.

24:23.253 --> 24:24.296
- BITCH.
- [bleep].

24:24.379 --> 24:26.047
- THROWING ME
UNDER THE [bleep] BUS.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.008
I HAVE NOTHING
TO [bleep] HIDE.

24:32.596 --> 24:35.307
- I ACTUALLY WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU TWO GUYS.

24:35.390 --> 24:38.143
I HAVE SOMETHING
THAT I DISCOVERED.

24:38.226 --> 24:41.188
SOMEONE HASN'T BEEN COMPLETELY
HONEST ABOUT THEIR ARTWORK.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.815
YOU SAW SCOTT'S TATTOO?
- YEAH.

24:43.899 --> 24:47.027
- HE SAID HE DREW IT.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.195
- [gasps]

24:48.278 --> 24:49.487
- THERE'S YOUR SAMURAI.

24:49.571 --> 24:53.158
THAT'S THE SAME PICTURE,
LINE FOR [bleep] LINE.

24:53.241 --> 24:55.577
- [laughs]
HOLY [bleep]!

24:55.660 --> 24:57.495
IT IS, DUDE!
WOW.

24:57.579 --> 25:00.290
- SO HE'S JUST TRACING STUFF.
- HE'S TRACING.

25:00.373 --> 25:03.168
HE'S TAKING IMAGES
AND PASSING THEM OFF AS HIS OWN.

25:03.251 --> 25:04.753
- WHAT AN ASS[bleep].
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.

25:04.836 --> 25:09.090
- I GUESS I GOT TO GET A COUPLE
MINUTES WITH THE JUDGES.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.300
- I WOULD.

25:10.383 --> 25:11.301
IT'S AT LEAST WORTH
BRINGING UP.

25:11.384 --> 25:14.095
{\an8}EITHER IT'S GOING TO WORK
AGAINST SCOTT,

25:14.179 --> 25:15.472
{\an8}WHICH I'M COOL WITH,

25:15.555 --> 25:17.724
OR IT'S GONNA MAKE JAY
LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT,

25:17.807 --> 25:20.143
WHICH, HONESTLY,
I'M COOL WITH THAT TOO.

25:20.227 --> 25:21.811
- TO BE AN INK MASTER,
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE

25:21.895 --> 25:23.104
TO DRAW YOUR OWN ARTWORK...

25:23.188 --> 25:26.149
- RIGHT.
- AND THEN TRANSFER IT TO SKIN.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.777
IF HE'S BEEN IN THE TOP
FOR [bleep] THAT HE'S COPYING

25:28.860 --> 25:31.780
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE TOP,
DRAWING MY OWN [bleep],

25:31.863 --> 25:34.366
I THINK THIS WHOLE COMPETITION
JUST CHANGED.

25:48.463 --> 25:50.257
- TODAY WE ASKED YOU
TO SHOW DETAIL

25:50.340 --> 25:53.677
BY TATTOOING WARRIORS.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.304
MATTI, LET'S START WITH YOU.

25:57.847 --> 26:00.141
- EVERY DETAIL
IN THE ACTUAL CHOICE

26:00.225 --> 26:02.310
OF THE WAY THAT THE DESIGN
WAS PUT TOGETHER

26:02.394 --> 26:03.895
HAS A GREAT LOOK TO IT.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.063
THE SUBTLE LITTLE DETAILS,

26:05.146 --> 26:06.439
THE CUT ON THE EYE,
THE SCAR,

26:06.523 --> 26:08.441
AND THE WAY THAT
THE SEVERED HEAD'S EYES

26:08.525 --> 26:10.485
ARE ROLLED UP IN HIS HEAD
WITH THE OPEN MOUTH--

26:10.568 --> 26:11.987
IT'S JUST VERY DYNAMIC.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.822
- THE DETAIL IN THE HELMET
IS GREAT.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.198
AND THEN YOU GO INTO THE FACE.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.658
YOU SEE THE FACE
IS EVEN BETTER.

26:16.741 --> 26:17.617
I LOVE IT, MAN.

26:17.701 --> 26:18.702
I WISH THAT WAS MY LEG.

26:18.785 --> 26:21.246
- YOU TOOK THIS KIND OF DARK,
GRUESOME IMAGE,

26:21.329 --> 26:23.498
AND YOU JUST LIVENED IT UP
WITH JUST REALLY, REALLY

26:23.581 --> 26:26.167
BRIGHT COLORS THAT MAKE
THIS THING VERY VIBRANT.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.711
IT'S [bleep] SUPER COOL.

26:27.794 --> 26:29.754
AND YOU'RE REALLY
STANDING OUT TODAY

26:29.838 --> 26:32.340
AMONGST FIVE BLACK-AND-GRAY
TATTOOS STANDING BEHIND YOU.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.717
- THANK YOU.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.680
- HALO.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.307
- YOU DIDN'T GO OVERBOARD
WITH DETAIL,

26:40.390 --> 26:42.183
BUT THE DETAIL YOU DID
IS VERY TRUE

26:42.267 --> 26:43.643
TO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

26:43.727 --> 26:44.769
THE BUCKLES ARE CLEAR.

26:44.853 --> 26:45.937
THE BREASTPLATES ARE CLEAR.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.314
AND EVEN THE MUSCLES
IN THE STOMACH,

26:47.397 --> 26:48.565
IT'S JUST SIMPLE,
BUT IT'S THERE.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.859
- HE LOOKS LIKE
HE'S READY FOR BATTLE.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.193
I LOVE THE FACT
THAT YOU SEE THE WHOLE ARROW

26:52.277 --> 26:53.194
THROUGH THE SHIELD.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.362
HE LOOKS LIKE A WARRIOR.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.697
- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
STRIKES ME THE MOST ABOUT IT

26:55.780 --> 26:59.701
IS JUST HOW FLUID AND NATURAL
THE ANATOMY OF IT LOOKS.

26:59.784 --> 27:02.579
MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS TATTOO
REALLY IS THE SHIELD,

27:02.662 --> 27:03.955
HOW IT'S ATTACHED
TO HIS ARM.

27:04.039 --> 27:07.042
IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
IT'S SITTING IN THE RIGHT SPOT.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.251
LIKE, HIS ARM WOULD BE TUCKED UP
IN THERE A LITTLE BIT.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.545
THAT THROWS ME OFF.

27:10.628 --> 27:12.005
OTHER THAN THAT, MAN,
ALL THE DETAILS YOU CAPTURED

27:12.088 --> 27:14.090
IN THIS TATTOO--
VERY, VERY NICE

27:14.174 --> 27:15.675
AND A VERY SMOOTH APPLICATION.

27:19.304 --> 27:22.182
- MELISSA.

27:22.265 --> 27:23.350
- I LIKE THIS TATTOO.

27:23.433 --> 27:24.517
I LIKE THE LAYOUT.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.269
YOU WENT HEAVY ON THE DETAIL,

27:26.353 --> 27:28.271
SO ALL OF THE OUTSIDE AREA
IS REALLY DENSE,

27:28.355 --> 27:30.440
BUT THE FACE STANDS OUT,
AND IT LOOKS PRETTY.

27:30.523 --> 27:31.941
BUT YOU DEFINITELY DID
DENT UP HER NOSE A LITTLE BIT.

27:32.025 --> 27:35.403
THE SHADING YOU PUT IN THE TIP
OF HER NOSE, FROM A DISTANCE,

27:35.487 --> 27:36.529
THAT DIVOT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE
IT'S THE NOSTRIL

27:36.613 --> 27:39.240
THAT'S MAKING HER NOSE
LOOK OFF-CENTERED.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.284
- WHAT IS REALLY STANDING OUT
TO ME IS,

27:41.368 --> 27:42.786
IF WE LOOK AT THE RIDGE
OF HER NOSE

27:42.869 --> 27:43.870
AND WE LOOK AT THE RIDGE
OF THE HEADDRESS,

27:43.953 --> 27:45.413
WHERE THE BEAK IS,
THEN IT MAKES THE HEADDRESS

27:45.497 --> 27:47.749
LOOK LIKE
IT'S OFF TO THE SIDE.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.376
BUT YOU PUT TOGETHER
SOME GREAT SUBJECT MATTER.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.795
IT WAS A GOOD JOB.
- THANK YOU.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.802
- SAUSAGE.

27:58.885 --> 28:01.429
DO YOU THINK THAT SCOTT
HANDED YOU THIS CANVAS

28:01.513 --> 28:04.182
IN SOME KIND
OF STRATEGIC GAME PLAY?

28:04.265 --> 28:05.266
- YEAH,
HE'S DOING HIS BEST

28:05.350 --> 28:07.602
TO TRY TO MAKE SURE
THAT I DON'T GO TO THE FINALS.

28:07.685 --> 28:08.603
- I DON'T THINK
THAT IT'S THAT

28:08.686 --> 28:10.105
I DON'T WANT HIM
IN THE FINALS.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.148
IT'S JUST, I'M GONNA MAKE IT
A LIVING HELL FOR HIM

28:12.232 --> 28:13.316
IF I GET THE CANVAS PICK.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.818
- I'M GONNA CONTINUE
TO DO GOOD TATTOOS,

28:14.901 --> 28:16.277
WHETHER IT'S ON [bleep] CANVAS
OR ON REALLY GOOD CANVAS.

28:16.361 --> 28:18.446
I'M HERE TO WIN.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.657
- WELL, I THINK THAT
YOU ROSE THROUGH ADVERSITY.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.325
AND I THINK THIS TATTOO
IS BEAUTIFUL.

28:22.409 --> 28:23.284
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.286
- THE DETAIL YOU HAVE
IN THIS TATTOO--

28:25.370 --> 28:26.704
THE BREASTPLATE, THE BEADS,
THE LITTLE FEATHER

28:26.788 --> 28:30.959
OFF THE TOMAHAWK--
IT MAKES THE TATTOO JUMP OUT.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.002
- I LIKE THE SUBTLE TREE LINE
THAT YOU GOT ABOVE IT,

28:33.086 --> 28:35.505
JUST TO GIVE IT A HINT
THAT SHE'S IN THE WILDERNESS.

28:35.588 --> 28:36.840
MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS IS,

28:36.923 --> 28:38.842
SHE JUST LOOKS A LITTLE STIFF
AND AWKWARD.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.635
AND THE HAND DOES LOOK
A LITTLE MANNISH.

28:40.718 --> 28:42.971
BUT OVERALL, MAN,
VERY SMOOTH APPLICATION,

28:43.054 --> 28:46.141
GREAT USE OF FINE DETAILS.

28:47.350 --> 28:48.810
- SCOTT.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.568
- SCOTT, I LOVE THIS TATTOO,
MAN.

28:56.651 --> 28:57.986
IT'S A VERY DYNAMIC DRAWING.

28:58.069 --> 28:59.320
BUT THE ANATOMY OF THE WARRIOR

28:59.404 --> 29:00.822
SITTING ON THE HORSE
DOESN'T FLOW RIGHT.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.323
- I WANTED IT TO LOOK LIKE
THE HORSE WAS REALLY COMING UP,

29:02.407 --> 29:04.701
AND HE WAS BACK LIKE THIS.

29:04.784 --> 29:05.994
- THERE JUST NEEDS TO BE

29:06.077 --> 29:07.454
SEPARATION OF THE BODY PARTS
IN THERE,

29:07.537 --> 29:10.165
AND FROM HIS KNEE TO HIS THIGH
TO HIS WAIST TO HIS CHEST,

29:10.248 --> 29:11.082
THERE'S NO SEPARATION.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.751
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE
A SMALL LITTLE AREA.

29:13.835 --> 29:17.005
BUT I LOVED THE DETAIL IN
THE CHEST PLATE AND THE HELMET.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.799
THIS IS JUST
A VERY DYNAMIC ILLUSTRATION.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.718
- HE LOOKS LIKE
A MEAN MOTHER[bleep].

29:21.801 --> 29:22.969
[laughter]

29:23.052 --> 29:23.970
- THE USE OF THE LITTLE PAGODA
IN THE BACKGROUND

29:24.053 --> 29:26.514
REALLY GIVES THIS THING
SOME NICE DIMENSION.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.392
AS ALWAYS, YOUR SHADING IS
SMOOTH, AND YOUR BLACK IS RICH.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.102
AND LOOKING AT THIS
FROM ACROSS THE ROOM,

29:31.186 --> 29:31.519
IT'S A TOUGH TATTOO.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.646
- THANK YOU.

29:37.275 --> 29:40.028
- JAY.

29:40.111 --> 29:41.654
- MAN, REALLY, WHAT I JUST
GOT TO GET INTO IS THIS SKY.

29:41.738 --> 29:44.199
I MEAN, WE'VE SEEN
SOME BAD BACKGROUNDS.

29:44.282 --> 29:45.325
THIS IS SOME BAD BACKGROUND.

29:45.408 --> 29:46.201
- THAT WAS
THE END OF THE TATTOO

29:46.284 --> 29:48.036
WHERE HE JUST
WOULDN'T STOP MOVING.

29:48.119 --> 29:48.745
- YOU WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER OFF

29:48.828 --> 29:51.789
JUST DOING YOUR FIGURE ALONE.

29:51.873 --> 29:52.832
- THE WARRIOR'S DRAWN
AND SHADED NICELY.

29:52.916 --> 29:55.376
I THINK THE SECOND
YOU GOT TO THE BACKGROUND,

29:55.460 --> 29:56.544
YOU WERE LIKE, "[bleep] IT."

29:56.628 --> 29:58.630
JUST LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE
TATTOOING REALLY PISSED OFF.

29:58.713 --> 30:00.423
- I'M A LITTLE BIT OFF TODAY,
ACTUALLY.

30:00.507 --> 30:03.468
CAN I SPEAK
WITHOUT BEING INTERRUPTED?

30:03.551 --> 30:06.471
- I MEAN,
WE PROBABLY WILL RESPOND.

30:06.554 --> 30:07.555
- I HAVE SUSPICIONS

30:07.639 --> 30:11.059
THAT SCOTT HAS BEEN TRACING
ALL OF HIS [bleep].

30:11.142 --> 30:12.560
HERE, JUST TAKE THAT.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.812
- OKAY.

30:14.896 --> 30:17.607
JAY, EXPLAIN TO ME
WHAT I'M LOOKING AT HERE.

30:17.690 --> 30:19.901
- REFERENCES
THAT SCOTT'S BEEN TRACING.

30:19.984 --> 30:20.860
IF YOU'RE GONNA SAY
THAT YOU'RE CREATING

30:20.944 --> 30:23.446
SOMETHING ORIGINAL
AND THEN YOU'RE NOT,

30:23.530 --> 30:25.490
YOU'RE GAINING AN ADVANTAGE
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

30:25.573 --> 30:26.950
- SCOTT, HOW DO YOU RESPOND
TO THIS?

30:27.033 --> 30:27.450
- I LOOKED AT A STATUE
OF A HORSE.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.369
I DID MY [bleep].

30:29.452 --> 30:30.537
I'LL USE REFERENCES
ALL THE TIME.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.080
I'LL PRINT OUT
FIVE OR SIX OF THEM.

30:32.163 --> 30:33.081
HE'S SCRAMBLING.

30:33.164 --> 30:33.748
HE'S AT THE END OF HIS ROPE,
MAN.

30:33.831 --> 30:35.333
HE'S JUST LOOKING FOR ANY--

30:35.416 --> 30:36.417
- IT HAS BEEN CHANGED.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.253
- I WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON
THAT THOUGHT THAT.

30:38.336 --> 30:38.920
- YOU CAN THINK WHAT YOU WANT,
MAN.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.380
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

30:40.463 --> 30:41.464
- HOLD ON.
LET'S--

30:41.548 --> 30:44.467
JAY, IF I'M GONNA DO
A TATTOO OF A [bleep] HORSE,

30:44.551 --> 30:45.635
I'M GONNA PULL UP A LOT
OF [bleep] HORSE REFERENCES.

30:45.718 --> 30:46.886
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.
- AND I'M GONNA--

30:46.970 --> 30:49.222
- BUT IF IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU JUST TRACED IT

30:49.305 --> 30:51.558
OUT OF A PICTURE, THEN THAT'S
NOT YOUR ORIGINAL ARTWORK.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.393
- WHAT HE DID
IS MADE A COLLABORATION

30:53.476 --> 30:54.894
OF ALL THESE
DIFFERENT IDEAS.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.854
- DUDE, I'LL SHOW YOU
EVERY IMAGE I USE, MAN.

30:56.938 --> 30:58.106
MY TATTOOS ARE CHANGED ENOUGH

30:58.189 --> 30:59.482
WHERE I'M DOING MY OWN THING
WITH THEM.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.109
- DID HE OR DID HE NOT
MAKE CHANGES

31:01.192 --> 31:02.610
ON THE REFERENCES
THAT HE TOOK?

31:02.694 --> 31:04.362
- THAT LOOKS REAL SIMILAR
TO THAT THING, MAN.

31:04.445 --> 31:06.531
- BUT "REAL SIMILAR"

31:06.614 --> 31:07.949
AND "EXACTLY THE SAME"
ARE DIFFERENT.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.535
- I USE REFERENCES
IN DOING TATTOOS LIKE THIS.

31:10.618 --> 31:12.579
IT'S [bleep] SMART.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

31:12.662 --> 31:15.039
MAYBE YOUR [bleep] TATTOOS
WOULD LOOK BETTER, JAY.

31:15.123 --> 31:16.124
- [laughs]

31:16.207 --> 31:16.916
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT WHATEVER YOU'RE--

31:17.000 --> 31:17.792
- YOU SHOULD BE
[bleep] WORRIED.

31:17.875 --> 31:19.919
- NOBODY OVER HERE
IS SCARED OF YOU.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.296
- BITCH.
- [bleep].

31:21.379 --> 31:22.839
- ALL RIGHT, JAY,
LET'S MOVE ON,

31:22.922 --> 31:27.176
UNLESS ANYBODY HAS ANYTHING
UNKNOWN TO ADD TO THIS.

31:27.260 --> 31:29.220
- NO.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.311
- I WANT TO SAY
THIS HAS BEEN

31:36.394 --> 31:38.271
ONE OF THE BEST DAYS
OF ALL-AROUND TATTOOING

31:38.354 --> 31:39.397
WE'VE SEEN
THIS WHOLE COMPETITION.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.524
JUST DON'T WORRY ABOUT
WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING,

31:41.608 --> 31:42.859
PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN,
AND DO YOUR BEST,

31:42.942 --> 31:44.152
AND THEN THE OUTCOME'S
GONNA COME.

31:44.235 --> 31:45.820
- THE PRESSURE IS MOUNTING.
YOU CAN SEE IT.

31:45.903 --> 31:47.196
PEOPLE ARE MAKING MOVES.

31:47.280 --> 31:47.864
THINGS ARE GETTING MORE TENSE.

31:47.947 --> 31:49.907
AT THE END OF THE COMPETITION,

31:49.991 --> 31:51.576
IT'S GONNA BE
ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE TATTOO.

31:51.659 --> 31:53.536
IT'S GONNA BE
ABOUT WHO DOES THE BEST STUFF.

31:53.620 --> 31:57.165
AND I THINK THE COMPETITION
IS SUPER TIGHT.

31:57.248 --> 31:59.417
- BEFORE WE SEND YOU BACK
TO THE LOFT,

31:59.500 --> 32:02.295
THE JUDGES HAVE DETERMINED
A WINNER.

32:02.378 --> 32:02.920
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED

32:03.004 --> 32:06.841
THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY

32:06.924 --> 32:07.300
GOES TO MATTI.

32:07.383 --> 32:09.844
[applause]

32:09.927 --> 32:11.471
- THANKS.
THANK YOU.

32:11.554 --> 32:13.598
- WITH OR WITHOUT COLOR,

32:13.681 --> 32:16.392
YOUR PIECE HAD
A LOT OF GREAT CONTRAST IN IT.

32:16.476 --> 32:18.227
AND JUST THE DETAILS
THAT STOOD OUT,

32:18.311 --> 32:19.896
MAKING THIS IMAGE WHAT IT WAS,

32:19.979 --> 32:21.189
CAME OUT ON TOP TODAY, MAN.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.148
- THANK YOU.

32:22.231 --> 32:23.232
- CONGRATULATIONS, MATTI.

32:23.316 --> 32:24.901
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO CHOOSE THE ARTIST

32:24.984 --> 32:27.362
THAT YOU THINK
HAS THE WORST TATTOO

32:27.445 --> 32:29.155
AND PUT THEM UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

32:29.238 --> 32:30.615
YOU HAVE A TOUGH DECISION,
MAN.

32:30.698 --> 32:31.532
- YEAH.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.785
- 'CAUSE WE HAD
A STRONG SHOWING TODAY.

32:33.868 --> 32:36.079
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS ALSO DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW.

32:36.162 --> 32:40.083
THEIR VOTE WILL PUT ANOTHER
ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.167
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT.

32:41.250 --> 32:42.877
WE'LL CALL YOU
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

32:54.597 --> 32:57.141
- JAY'S GOING DOWN, MAN.

32:57.225 --> 32:58.643
THROWING ME
UNDER THE [bleep] BUS,

32:58.726 --> 33:00.937
SEE, THAT WAS YOUR MISTAKE
RIGHT THERE, DUDE.

33:01.020 --> 33:03.564
- YOU SHOULD BE COUNTING
YOUR LUCKY STARS.

33:03.648 --> 33:04.732
- I HAVE NOTHING
TO [bleep] HIDE.

33:04.816 --> 33:05.775
- YOU GOT A LOT TO HIDE.

33:05.858 --> 33:07.151
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU COULD TELL ME

33:07.235 --> 33:07.819
THAT YOU DREW YOUR OWN WORK.

33:07.902 --> 33:10.154
I DON'T BELIEVE FOR ONE SECOND

33:10.238 --> 33:12.782
THAT YOU HAD THE INSIGHT
TO PULL THAT [bleep] OFF.

33:12.865 --> 33:15.243
{\an8}- JAY TRYING TO DISCREDIT
MY ARTWORK JUST SHOWS

33:15.326 --> 33:16.786
{\an8}HE'S JUST CLAWING
FOR ANY CHANCE

33:16.869 --> 33:18.496
{\an8}TO STAY
IN THIS COMPETITION NOW.

33:18.579 --> 33:20.331
IF YOU THINK I CAN'T DRAW,
[bleep] THAT.

33:20.415 --> 33:21.207
I CAN DRAW MY [bleep] ASS OFF.

33:21.290 --> 33:22.709
- SCOTT NEEDS
HIS DAILY COMPLIMENTS,

33:22.792 --> 33:25.002
OTHERWISE HE CAN'T FUNCTION.

33:25.086 --> 33:27.255
HIS EGO CAN'T TAKE
NOT BEING FLOATED UP.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.590
- I CAN'T WAIT TO DO
THIS ELIMINATION, MAN.

33:29.674 --> 33:30.800
- I AIN'T WORRIED ABOUT IT.

33:30.883 --> 33:32.093
- THIS MIGHT BE THE END, MAN.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.595
- NOTHING IS DECIDED.
THAT'S NUMBER ONE.

33:34.679 --> 33:37.014
NUMBER TWO,
I KNOW I DID A GOOD TATTOO.

33:37.098 --> 33:39.517
AND NUMBER THREE,
WE KNOW WHO THE ASS[bleep]

33:39.600 --> 33:40.685
OF THE HOUSE IS.

33:40.768 --> 33:44.522
SO EITHER WAY,
I ALREADY WON.

33:57.577 --> 33:58.578
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
SO WE'RE DOWN TO SIX.

33:58.661 --> 34:00.538
DETAIL CHALLENGE--

34:00.621 --> 34:02.165
THEY TATTOOED WARRIORS.

34:02.248 --> 34:03.124
- EVERYBODY TURNING IN
SUCH GOOD WORK,

34:03.207 --> 34:05.251
IT'S REALLY TIGHTENED UP
THE COMPETITION.

34:05.334 --> 34:07.044
- YEAH, NOW IT'S COMING DOWN
TO THE NITPICKY STUFF,

34:07.128 --> 34:08.838
WHICH MAKES IT A LOT MORE FUN
TO CRITIQUE.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.215
- SPEAKING OF WHICH, LET'S GET
INTO THESE SPECIFICALLY.

34:11.299 --> 34:14.385
WE HAD SCOTT,
WHO DID THE SAMURAI WARRIOR.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.012
- I LIKE THE HORSE,
WITH THE MUSCLES AND EVERYTHING.

34:16.094 --> 34:17.889
THAT LOOKS LIKE A HORSE
READY TO BATTLE.

34:17.972 --> 34:20.641
- OVERALL,
I REALLY LIKE THIS TATTOO.

34:20.725 --> 34:23.143
IT'S JUST FLAWS WITH THE ANATOMY
OF THE WARRIOR.

34:23.226 --> 34:24.437
HE USED A REFERENCE.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.147
AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE HE DID
ANYTHING WRONG.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.024
YOU HAVE TO BE ALLOWED
TO USE A REFERENCE.

34:28.107 --> 34:29.192
NOTHING THAT WE SAW TODAY

34:29.275 --> 34:31.027
WAS MADE UP
FROM THEIR IMAGINATION.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.487
DO YOU THINK MATTI
MADE UP THE FACT

34:32.570 --> 34:33.821
THAT THE VIKINGS
HAVE TWO HORNS?

34:33.905 --> 34:35.364
NO, MAN, THIS IS ALL TAKEN
FROM REFERENCE.

34:35.447 --> 34:39.827
- LET'S TALK ABOUT JAY USING
THE REFERENCE OF THAT MASK.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.329
THAT THING'S JUST TERRIBLE.

34:41.411 --> 34:43.498
- THAT'S THE WORST PART
OF HIS TATTOO, IS THAT HELMET.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.166
- THIS IS A GUY THROWING STONES
WHO LIVES IN A GLASS HOUSE.

34:45.248 --> 34:48.377
- IF HE WOULD'VE GOT
SOME REFERENCE OF SOME TREES

34:48.460 --> 34:49.212
AND TRACED THOSE TREES
ON THERE,

34:49.295 --> 34:50.670
THAT WOULD'VE HELPED HIM OUT
A LOT.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.672
- I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED

34:52.757 --> 34:54.007
WITH WHAT MELISSA TURNED IN
TODAY.

34:54.091 --> 34:55.342
WHAT DID YOU THINK?

34:55.426 --> 34:57.762
- THE COMPOSITION OF
THE DRAWING'S A LITTLE BIT OFF.

34:57.845 --> 35:00.515
THE WAY THE HEADWEAR LINES UP
WITH THE FACE,

35:00.598 --> 35:02.099
EVERYTHING'S TURNED
JUST A LITTLE BIT

35:02.183 --> 35:03.392
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.353
- SAUSAGE DID
THE INDIAN WARRIOR.

35:05.436 --> 35:07.855
- I DIDN'T LIKE THE HAND
AND THE NECK PIECE.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.816
IF A GUY'S GONNA LOOK
AT A FEMALE,

35:09.899 --> 35:11.108
I WANT TO SEE A GIRL'S NECK.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.152
- I AM BOTHERED BY THE ANATOMY
A LITTLE BIT.

35:13.236 --> 35:13.945
BUT HIS SKILL
AT DOING BLACK-AND-GRAY

35:14.028 --> 35:16.197
IS ONE OF THE BEST
IN THE ROOM.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.240
- WELL, WHEN THE COMPETITION
GETS THIS TIGHT,

35:17.323 --> 35:20.409
THOSE INCONSISTENCIES
ARE GONNA BE GLARING.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.370
WE WANTED THIS THING
TO BE A TIGHT RACE.

35:22.453 --> 35:23.287
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE THERE.

35:23.371 --> 35:24.664
- WE HAVE THE RIGHT
TOP SIX PEOPLE.

35:24.747 --> 35:25.873
- I AGREE.

35:25.957 --> 35:26.874
- WE HAVE A DECISION?
- ABSOLUTELY.

35:26.958 --> 35:27.333
- AGREED.
- ALL RIGHT, MAN.

35:28.751 --> 35:31.212
{\an8}- SO WE'RE HERE TO DETERMINE

35:31.295 --> 35:35.299
{\an8}WHO GOT THE WORST TATTOO
OF THE DAY.

35:35.383 --> 35:36.926
- THAT IS MY PIECE.

35:37.009 --> 35:37.802
MY ARTIST WAS MELISSA.

35:37.885 --> 35:39.720
SHE USED MY FACE IN IT.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.515
I THINK IT DOES LOOK LIKE ME.

35:42.598 --> 35:44.183
- HER NOSE, SHE DARKENED IT
A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.978
AND IT MADE IT LOOK
LIKE YOUR EYEBROWS

35:47.061 --> 35:48.271
WENT INTO YOUR NOSE.

35:48.354 --> 35:50.106
- WHEN IT HEALS,
IT'S GONNA GET WAY LIGHTER.

35:50.189 --> 35:53.317
THIS TATTOO IS MY BEST TATTOO
THAT I'VE EVER GOTTEN.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.778
- THE MOUTH--IT DOESN'T LOOK
THE SAME AS YOURS.

35:55.862 --> 35:57.238
IT LOOKS A LITTLE WEIRD.

35:57.321 --> 36:01.826
- I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE
THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT.

36:01.909 --> 36:02.994
- THAT'S MY PIECE.

36:03.077 --> 36:04.078
HALO WAS MY ARTIST.

36:04.161 --> 36:05.913
- THE ONLY THING
I CAN'T GET MY HEAD AROUND

36:05.997 --> 36:07.748
IS THE DIMENSION
OF THE SHIELD.

36:07.832 --> 36:10.376
THE UPPER PART IS BIGGER
THAN THE BOTTOM.

36:10.459 --> 36:11.043
YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE CENTER.

36:11.127 --> 36:11.794
I MEAN, YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

36:11.878 --> 36:13.713
IT'S A HEAVY SHIELD.

36:13.796 --> 36:15.423
IT DOESN'T LOOK PROPORTIONATE.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.675
- I LOVE IT.

36:17.758 --> 36:20.177
- THIS IS MY TATTOO.

36:20.261 --> 36:21.262
JAY WAS MY ARTIST.
HE WASN'T VERY PROFESSIONAL.

36:21.345 --> 36:23.764
HIS WHOLE THING WAS,
"YOU'RE GETTING A FREE TATTOO,

36:23.848 --> 36:24.765
"SO IT'S GONNA BE MY WAY.

36:24.849 --> 36:25.641
"OR YOU COULD LEAVE,
AND I'LL TATTOO MYSELF.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.602
I'M READY TO DO THAT."

36:27.685 --> 36:28.811
- WHAT?
- VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.

36:28.895 --> 36:30.021
- HE HAD A REALLY POOR ATTITUDE,

36:30.104 --> 36:30.938
AND I JUST--
I DIDN'T APPRECIATE IT.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.106
- YOU CAN SEE THE ATTITUDE

36:32.190 --> 36:34.775
ACTUALLY REFLECTED
ON THE TATTOO.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.193
- I'M DISAPPOINTED WITH IT.

36:36.277 --> 36:39.238
THE SHIELD IS JUST WAY TOO MUCH
HEAVY, HEAVY BLACK.

36:39.322 --> 36:41.199
LIKE, YOUR SHIELD HAS RIDGES
AND BUMPS.

36:41.282 --> 36:44.285
MINE IS JUST A FIST-SIZED GLOB
OF BLACK INK.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.120
- IT KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE A DOORWAY TO A CAVE.

36:46.203 --> 36:47.955
- LIKE THE COVER
FOR A GARBAGE CAN.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.917
- THIS PIECE IS NOT READABLE.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.168
- I'M NOT HAPPY.

36:52.251 --> 36:54.795
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT AN INK MASTER WOULD DO.

36:54.879 --> 36:56.756
- HAVE WE ALL REACHED
A DECISION?

36:56.839 --> 36:58.466
all: YES.
- OKAY.

36:58.549 --> 37:00.384
[door closes]

37:05.181 --> 37:06.057
- SO, MATTI, WHICH ONE
OF YOUR FELLOW ARTISTS

37:06.140 --> 37:09.101
ARE YOU PUTTING UP
FOR ELIMINATION?

37:10.895 --> 37:13.606
- I GOT TO GO WITH JAY.

37:13.689 --> 37:14.357
- ALL RIGHT.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.652
MATTI, YOU'LL COME DOWN
AND JAY

37:17.735 --> 37:19.487
AND MELISSA.

37:19.570 --> 37:20.947
- WOW.

37:21.030 --> 37:23.616
- SEE Y'ALL DOWN THERE.

37:23.699 --> 37:26.577
- I'M SO SICK OF HEARING JAY'S
LOUD-ASS MOUTH IN THE LOFT.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.704
{\an8}I CAN'T WAIT FOR HIS PIG ASS
TO GO WHEE, WHEE, WHEE,

37:28.788 --> 37:30.289
{\an8}ALL THE WAY HOME.

37:30.373 --> 37:32.500
- YOU WANT TO GO?
COME ON.

37:46.430 --> 37:50.434
- TODAY WE ASKED YOU
TO TATTOO FEARLESS WARRIORS.

37:50.518 --> 37:54.647
JAY, YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE MATTI
PUT YOU UP FOR ELIMINATION.

37:54.730 --> 37:56.357
MATTI, WHY JAY?

37:56.440 --> 37:59.318
- FOR ME, WITH THE BACKGROUND
THAT JAY HAD,

37:59.402 --> 38:00.528
IT WAS FAIRLY OBVIOUS.

38:00.611 --> 38:03.406
- MOST OF THE THINGS I WANTED
TO PUT IN THE BACKGROUND,

38:03.489 --> 38:04.573
I DIDN'T GET TO PUT IN THERE

38:04.657 --> 38:06.367
'CAUSE THE GUY
JUST DID NOT WANT IT.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.869
HE WAS SECOND-GUESSING AND
QUESTIONING EVERYTHING I DID.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.621
- WELL, THEN WOULD IT
SURPRISE YOU TO FIND OUT

38:10.705 --> 38:13.082
THAT YOU'RE ALSO HERE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

38:13.165 --> 38:15.042
VOTED YOU
WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY?

38:15.126 --> 38:16.669
- I ALREADY KNEW
THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

38:16.752 --> 38:17.294
IT WAS A STRUGGLE.

38:17.378 --> 38:17.920
CHANGE THIS, CHANGE THAT.

38:18.004 --> 38:20.089
IN REALITY, THAT GUY

38:20.172 --> 38:21.632
WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN TATTOOED
IN MY SHOP.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.552
- PART OF THIS COMPETITION
IS DEALING WITH WHAT'S DEALT.

38:24.635 --> 38:25.720
WE KNOW FROM PAST EXPERIENCE

38:25.803 --> 38:28.723
THAT YOU CAN DO A BETTER TATTOO
THAN WHAT WE SAW TODAY.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.558
YOUR OVERALL CHARACTER LOOKS
A LITTLE STIFF AND RIGID.

38:30.641 --> 38:31.392
AND YOU WOULD'VE BEEN
A LOT BETTER OFF

38:31.475 --> 38:34.895
NOT PUTTING THAT SKY
IN THERE, MAN.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.565
- I WOULD LIKE TO STAY.
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.

38:37.648 --> 38:40.109
I STILL GOT PLENTY LEFT
TO SHOW.

38:40.192 --> 38:43.279
- MELISSA, YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THE JUDGES THOUGHT

38:43.362 --> 38:46.532
THAT YOU ALSO HAD ONE OF
THE WEAKEST TATTOOS OF THE DAY.

38:46.615 --> 38:47.616
- ALTHOUGH THERE'S A LOT
OF THINGS ABOUT THIS TATTOO

38:47.700 --> 38:50.870
THAT I REALLY LIKE,
IT STILL LEAVES US TO WONDER

38:50.953 --> 38:52.538
HOW FAR YOUR SKILL GOES

38:52.621 --> 38:54.415
AS FAR AS THE APPLICATION
OF BLACK AND GRAY.

38:54.498 --> 38:56.917
- I REALLY LIKE THE TATTOO
I DID TODAY, HONESTLY.

38:57.001 --> 38:59.670
I'M STILL LEARNING, AND I'M
GONNA ALWAYS KEEP LEARNING.

38:59.754 --> 39:02.131
- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE DAYS
WHERE IT'S REALLY HARD,

39:02.214 --> 39:04.925
BECAUSE AT THIS POINT
OF THE COMPETITION,

39:05.009 --> 39:06.844
THERE IS NOT GONNA BE SOMEBODY
WHO DID A BAD TATTOO

39:06.927 --> 39:09.263
THAT IS GONNA GO HOME.

39:09.346 --> 39:11.265
IT'S JUST GONNA BE
THE WEAKEST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

39:11.348 --> 39:14.477
- GUYS, THERE ARE NO MORE
EASY DECISIONS.

39:14.560 --> 39:18.397
ULTIMATELY, SOMEONE WILL GO HOME
FOR A GOOD TATTOO.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.860
THE JUDGES HAVE
DECIDED...

39:22.943 --> 39:25.780
[knuckles cracking]

39:31.494 --> 39:34.789
NEITHER OF YOU WILL BE
PACKING YOUR MACHINES TODAY.

39:34.872 --> 39:37.124
- WHAT?

39:37.208 --> 39:39.627
- COMING INTO THIS CHALLENGE
TODAY,

39:39.710 --> 39:42.254
WE GOT THE TOP SIX PEOPLE
DOING GREAT TATTOOS.

39:42.338 --> 39:44.131
AND I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE
OUT OF THE TOP SIX.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.674
LET'S KEEP THIS COMPETITION
TIGHT

39:45.758 --> 39:46.967
AND SEE WHO COMES OUT ON TOP.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.219
- TO ME, IN COMPETITION,

39:48.302 --> 39:49.637
IT'S ALWAYS,
KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE PRIZE.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.556
I WANT TO BE BETTER THAN HIM.
HE'S NEVER GONNA BEAT ME.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.642
I'M GONNA BE BETTER THAN HIM.
THAT'S THE WAY I SEE IT.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.811
AND THAT'S WHAT I LOOK FOR
WHEN I GO INTO THE RING.

39:56.894 --> 39:57.978
- IT'S A GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT

39:58.062 --> 39:59.230
TO MAKE IT
WHERE YOU'VE MADE IT.

39:59.313 --> 40:01.857
WE WANT TO SEE YOU GUYS
LET YOUR ART DO THE TALKING.

40:01.941 --> 40:03.109
- I GOT GOOSE BUMPS.

40:03.192 --> 40:04.026
- GREAT.

40:04.110 --> 40:06.028
SPORT THEM ALL THE WAY
TO THE NEXT TATTOO

40:06.112 --> 40:07.780
AND COME BACK
AND AVENGE YOUR DEATH.

40:07.863 --> 40:08.948
- HELL YEAH.

40:09.031 --> 40:10.908
- BECAUSE TODAY WAS YOUR DEATH.

40:10.991 --> 40:13.911
STEP BACK UP
AND GO OUT SWINGING.

40:13.994 --> 40:15.704
- YOU CAN ALL HEAD BACK
TO THE LOFT.

40:18.582 --> 40:20.042
- [bleep] YEAH.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.839
narrator: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:24.922 --> 40:26.173
- NINE LIVES.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.633
- WHAT THE [bleep]?

40:27.716 --> 40:30.970
- IF JAY SURVIVES ANOTHER WEEK,
I'M GONNA BE [bleep] PISSED.

40:31.053 --> 40:32.555
- YOU'RE NOT DONE
DEALING WITH ME YET.

40:32.638 --> 40:34.807
{\an8}- THERE WILL BE
NO FLASH CHALLENGE.
