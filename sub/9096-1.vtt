04:14.712 --> 04:18.757
Come on. It's all right.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.052
Yes, it's all right.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.104
Wake up, Will.

04:37.569 --> 04:40.154
Starboard bow ahoy.

04:48.496 --> 04:51.040
- What is it, Slade?
- Thought I heard somethin'.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.209
Sounded like a bell.

04:54.794 --> 04:59.007
- Native fishermen, perhaps.
- Or a reef marker, sir.

04:59.090 --> 05:02.051
Mr Calamy, the lead, if you please.

05:16.983 --> 05:21.154
- By the mark, five fathom.
- Five fathom.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.630
Sand and broken shell.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.764
What is it?

05:49.849 --> 05:52.477
Two points off the starboard bow,
in the fog bank.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.604
What was it? A sail?

05:54.687 --> 05:59.192
- I don't know what it was.
- Should we beat to quarters?

06:06.449 --> 06:10.828
- I can't be certain.
- You're officer of the watch.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.915
Hollom, you must make a decision.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.752
We shall beat to quarters.

06:19.963 --> 06:23.132
Rouse up. Sleepers awake.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.472
Move. Move along.

06:29.556 --> 06:32.684
Jump to it, boys. Jump to it.

06:34.143 --> 06:36.062
Light along there.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.460
Sighting in heavy fog.

06:59.544 --> 07:03.089
- Handsomely on the yards tackle.
- Topmen aloft.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.142
Where away?

07:14.225 --> 07:18.980
Two points off the starboard bow, sir.
Not a mile distant.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.861
- You sure, Mr Hollom?
- Yes, sir.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.323
Man-of-war?

07:30.325 --> 07:32.201
I don't know, sir.

07:32.285 --> 07:36.122
It was only for a moment.
I thought I saw a shape.

07:39.042 --> 07:42.337
- Did you see it, Mr Calamy?
- No, sir.

07:44.422 --> 07:49.093
You did the right thing, Mr Hollom.
Go to your stations.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.931
The deck's yours, Tom.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.474
Sir.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.772
Clear away. And launch boats.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.574
- Quit your dawdling.
- You heard the man.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.118
Lower away.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.083
Haul both your yard tackles.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.171
Strike the bell.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.742
Down. All hands down.

09:09.173 --> 09:13.261
Hands to your stations.
Mr Hollar, damage report, if you please.

09:22.395 --> 09:26.232
18-pounders. We'll have to get closer.
Run out the starboard battery.

09:26.316 --> 09:30.111
Mr Allen, come up on the wind.
Lay me alongside at pistol-shot.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.536
Sharpshooters to the tops, Mr Howard.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.206
Sergeant. Take your section
into the main top.

09:41.289 --> 09:44.250
We stand tall on the quarterdeck.
All of us.

09:45.376 --> 09:48.338
- Mr Boyle, run up the colours.
- Aye, sir.

09:53.343 --> 09:57.305
Note for the log, Mr Watt.
"Engaged enemy frigate at six bells."

10:01.809 --> 10:04.437
- Straight at 'em, Mr Mowett.
- Straight at 'em, sir.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.940
Bill.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.901
Leave the swords.
Get the captain's silver below.

10:09.984 --> 10:14.030
She's not in range yet.
Stand fast till she's close enough.

10:14.113 --> 10:17.951
- Close with him amidships.
- Midships it is, sir.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.954
For God's sake, don't drop anything.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.460
Steady.

10:27.544 --> 10:31.089
- Hold your positions.
- Hold your position. Courage, now.

10:32.215 --> 10:36.553
- Hold steady, boys.
- Don't worry, lads, we'll serve 'em out yet.

10:36.636 --> 10:41.015
Mr Pullings, sir.
Davies, Jemmy, get Mr Pullings below.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.767
Aye, sir.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.395
Mr Blakeney, pass the word for the captain.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.231
Clear the forward pin rails.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.281
More sand on the floor.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.951
On the up-roll, fire!

11:12.964 --> 11:14.632
Down!

11:23.600 --> 11:28.146
Relieving-tackles on the tiller.
You men, collect these wounded.

11:30.315 --> 11:35.361
- Keep 'em spitting, Mr Calamy.
- Aye, sir. Reload and give 'em hell.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.806
Sir. To the taffrail.

12:10.355 --> 12:13.441
The rudder's shot away.
The steering don't answer.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.818
We're fish in a barrel.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.411
Why are we not firing?

12:29.874 --> 12:31.376
Let me through.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.962
Here, Joe.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.130
Hold it in there.

12:40.593 --> 12:45.598
- He's on the larboard bow, sir.
- Bring up your small arms.

12:48.685 --> 12:51.187
Prepare to repel boarders.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.440
Seize your weapons
and wait for the word.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.861
Your orders, sir?

12:59.821 --> 13:04.200
Call the gun crews to deck. Rig man-ropes
over the stern and pull the boats in.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.870
Put us in that fog, Tom.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.383
Pull together, men.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.594
Pull for the fog bank.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.514
Run 'em out.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.562
Fire!

13:33.855 --> 13:37.901
She's opened up a seam.
We need to get some oakum and pound it in.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.737
Joe, a mallet and some irons.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.870
She's gaining on us.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.923
- We're nearly there, boys.
- Pull.

14:00.006 --> 14:03.218
- Reach for it, men.
- We're home inside that fog.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.307
Fire!

14:10.892 --> 14:13.811
Pull for Lucky Jack.

14:13.895 --> 14:16.064
We've done it.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.236
Pipe down. Silence on deck.

14:31.162 --> 14:34.290
They'll not find us in here.

14:34.374 --> 14:38.002
Quiet, lads. No shouts, no calls.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.199
Avast rowing.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.538
Well done, lads.

15:37.562 --> 15:40.899
Two feet six inches, sir, and holding.

15:44.527 --> 15:47.280
- Good work, Mr Lamb.
- Thank you, sir.

15:57.832 --> 16:00.001
So, what's the butcher's bill?

16:00.084 --> 16:02.670
Nine dead, 27 wounded.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.389
Joe Plaice.

16:13.473 --> 16:18.811
He has a severely depressed fracture of
the skull. I don't think he'll see out the night.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.689
Lord Blakeney.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.361
Just a broken arm, sir.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.615
You're in very good hands.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.915
I'm doing everything I can.
I know you were close to his father.

16:38.998 --> 16:43.378
His father would've understood.
He knew the life. His mother, however...

16:43.461 --> 16:46.965
Let me take a look at that brow of yours.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.925
What?

16:53.680 --> 16:56.766
Damn, he was good.
Just came out of nowhere.

16:56.849 --> 17:01.980
Hit us with a full broadside,
cut across our tail and took out our rudder.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.315
Damn fine gunnery.

17:05.275 --> 17:09.945
We only slipped away because of the fog.
Quite fortunate, really.

17:10.029 --> 17:14.784
He may have had the weather gauge,
but we had the weather gods.

17:15.827 --> 17:21.665
I have no idea what it is you're talking about,
but he did seem to come off rather well.

17:22.584 --> 17:27.922
Seven weeks sailing, and he happens
in darkness on our exact position.

17:30.258 --> 17:34.429
The French have their spies
in England and elsewhere. As do we.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.931
Indeed.

17:38.141 --> 17:44.230
If he knew we were looking for him, he could
have stood to sea and passed well clear.

17:44.314 --> 17:47.483
Well then, perhaps he was looking for us.

18:13.676 --> 18:16.221
If she was a frigate, then I am a Dutchman.

18:16.304 --> 18:19.265
It was an unfair match.
There was no dishonour in it.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.601
She was more like a ship of the line.

18:21.684 --> 18:25.021
You have to wonder about her hull.
Our shots wouldn't penetrate.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.732
Triple-shotted at 200 yards - no effect.

18:27.815 --> 18:31.569
She had the weather gauge
and a clear advantage in firepower.

18:31.653 --> 18:34.239
What is the weather gauge?

18:34.322 --> 18:37.867
- Shall I show you again, Stephen?
- Not on the cloth.

18:39.953 --> 18:44.082
It means she had the wind in her favour,
therefore control of the engagement.

18:44.165 --> 18:47.502
And she had longer guns,
so she could hit us beyond our range.

18:47.585 --> 18:51.256
The simple fact is we were soundly beaten.

18:53.675 --> 18:58.805
- Heavy frigate like that in the Pacific...
- Could tip the war in Napoleon's favour.

18:59.347 --> 19:04.435
By comparison, the <i>Surprise</i>
is a somewhat aged man-of-war.

19:08.147 --> 19:12.944
- Am I not correct?
- Would you call me an aged man of war?

19:13.027 --> 19:16.364
The <i>Surprise</i> is not old.
No one would call her old.

19:16.447 --> 19:22.620
She has a bluff bow, lovely lines.
She's a fine sea boat, weatherly, stiff and fast.

19:22.704 --> 19:26.082
Very fast, if she's well-handled.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.293
No, she's not old.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.629
She's in her prime.

19:31.713 --> 19:36.301
We can patch up the main and mizzen.
Foresail's gone, so we'll bend our spare.

19:36.384 --> 19:40.471
Mr Lamb is confident with basic repairs.
We can get home as we are.

19:40.555 --> 19:43.391
We're not going home.

19:52.317 --> 19:56.487
But to refit we need a port,
and the <i>Acheron</i> may be still looking for us.

19:56.571 --> 20:00.909
We can refit at sea.
Here, where it shoals.

20:02.118 --> 20:06.873
As you said, she is taking the war to
the South Seas. We are supposed to stop her.

20:06.956 --> 20:14.214
But, sir - with respect - she's a vastly
heavier ship. She's out of our class.

20:15.131 --> 20:18.843
She could be halfway to Cape Horn
by the time we're repaired.

20:18.927 --> 20:22.597
Well then, there's not a moment to lose.

20:41.032 --> 20:44.202
Is it true they put the last stitch
through your nose?

20:44.285 --> 20:46.371
What do you mean?

20:47.413 --> 20:52.752
Joe said when you die, they stitch you in your
hammock with the last stitch in your nose,

20:52.835 --> 20:56.047
just to make sure you're not asleep.

20:59.676 --> 21:03.137
Not through the nose. You'll tell them?

21:59.819 --> 22:04.324
It's all right.
It's just the laudanum speaking.

22:37.899 --> 22:40.693
I've never seen a braver patient.

22:45.532 --> 22:49.577
Poor darling.
Never mind, soon have you fixed up.

22:49.661 --> 22:51.621
I want good work now.

22:51.704 --> 22:56.209
I'll need two men into the starboard
forechannels. Roberts, Chadwick.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.378
That's nice work there.

22:58.461 --> 23:01.756
Repair won't do here.
I need these replaced.

23:08.471 --> 23:11.808
Mr Calamy. There's something
might interest you here.

23:11.891 --> 23:16.479
Look. The captain carved that.
When he was a mid, no more than your age.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.439
He's known this ship man and boy.

23:18.523 --> 23:23.736
He says there's enough of his blood in the
woodwork for the ship to almost be a relation.

23:23.820 --> 23:28.074
I do understand your point.
Your knowledge is beyond question.

23:28.157 --> 23:33.580
However, a week in the Brazilian rainforest
looking for a new mast simply will not do.

23:33.663 --> 23:35.915
The <i>Acheron</i> will be halfway to China.

23:35.999 --> 23:41.754
Mr Lamb, as always, will do his best. Which
is all I can hope to expect from any man.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.582
Is them his brains?

24:17.665 --> 24:21.544
No, that's just dried blood.
Those are his brains.

24:26.883 --> 24:30.220
Physician, he is.
Ain't one of your common surgeons.

24:30.303 --> 24:33.473
- Can I have the coin, please?
- Sir.

24:38.186 --> 24:40.939
He wouldn't look at you
for under ten guineas on land.

24:41.022 --> 24:43.191
And he knows his birds and beasts.

24:43.274 --> 24:46.653
You show him a beetle
and he'll tell you what it's thinking.

24:46.736 --> 24:50.281
Back to work, you loafers.
Eckhart, use your pipe.

24:50.365 --> 24:52.784
Let's get on with it, gentlemen.

24:52.867 --> 24:56.663
You're not a pennyweight of use
gawpin' here.

25:03.253 --> 25:05.838
Still hasn't said a word, sir.

25:11.261 --> 25:14.264
Lord Blakeney. Feeling better?

25:14.347 --> 25:16.432
Much better, thank you, sir.

25:16.516 --> 25:18.601
Well, good. Good.

25:20.478 --> 25:24.607
The doctor told me
you were fond of reading, so I...

25:30.864 --> 25:34.367
It has all of his major battles
and some fine illustrations.

25:34.450 --> 25:36.369
Thank you, sir.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.164
Did you ever meet Lord Nelson, sir?

25:40.248 --> 25:43.960
I had the honour of serving with him.
At the Nile. A great victory.

25:44.043 --> 25:50.133
You can find it in here, actually.
Page 135, if I'm not mistaken.

25:51.551 --> 25:53.428
Yes.

25:59.350 --> 26:03.229
May I beg you to tell me
what kind of man he is?

26:05.440 --> 26:07.442
You should read the book.

26:07.525 --> 26:10.111
I will, sir. Thank you.

26:30.798 --> 26:35.929
Here we go again.
Scrape-scrape, screech-screech.

26:36.012 --> 26:39.933
Never a tune you could dance to,
not if you were drunk as Davy's sow.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.653
How about this?

26:51.736 --> 26:56.199
Or are you in the mood
for something more aggressive?

28:09.564 --> 28:11.733
Salute.

28:11.816 --> 28:13.735
Hats off.

28:15.904 --> 28:18.072
What's all this about?

28:20.825 --> 28:24.162
- What's this?
- It's the phantom, sir.

28:24.245 --> 28:28.041
Excuse me. That's what the men call it.
It's the <i>Acheron,</i> sir.

28:28.124 --> 28:31.044
You see, Will here, he seen her being built.

28:31.127 --> 28:36.299
In Boston, sir. During the peace.
But she's Yankee-built, sir.

28:36.382 --> 28:40.303
He was getting married, and his wife's
second cousin works in the yards,

28:40.386 --> 28:42.639
so Will here saw the ship out of water.

28:42.722 --> 28:47.977
Sir, I saw there was something right strange
about her, so I asked Joe...

28:48.061 --> 28:51.356
So he described it to me
and I knocked you up a model, sir.

28:51.439 --> 28:56.194
- And this framing is accurate?
- Exactly accurate, sir.

28:56.277 --> 28:58.863
- Thank you, lads.
- Thank you, sir.

28:58.947 --> 29:02.200
Killick, an extra ration of rum for these men.

29:02.283 --> 29:04.702
Thank you very much, sir.

29:04.786 --> 29:07.789
- Which I was saving for Salutin' Day.
- We'll drink wine.

29:07.872 --> 29:09.999
Oh, drink wine on Salutin' Day.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.752
Bluff above the water and sharp below.

29:12.835 --> 29:18.258
Gives the hull a finer entry and a long run
as she goes aft. That's why she's so fast.

29:18.341 --> 29:20.969
Heavier, but fast despite it.

29:22.011 --> 29:27.350
That's the future.
What a fascinating modern age we live in.

29:27.433 --> 29:31.312
Planking and framing like that
would make her hull 2ft thick. Solid oak.

29:31.396 --> 29:36.359
That's why we couldn't dent her. She's
probably capable of making 12 to 14 knots.

29:37.026 --> 29:40.363
Now we know. Thank God for Warley
and his wife's second cousin.

29:40.446 --> 29:43.408
She could be doing up to 280 miles a day.

29:43.491 --> 29:49.539
Even if we did catch up with her,
I mean, to take her...

29:49.622 --> 29:53.751
She's out of our class.
She's a 44-gun ship.

29:55.336 --> 29:59.799
She's still vulnerable at the stern,
like the rest of us.

30:13.521 --> 30:16.566
Hello, darling. How much for a kiss?

30:17.317 --> 30:19.360
<i>Quanto</i> cost-o kiss-o?

30:19.444 --> 30:22.655
- Name?
- My name is Maria.

30:22.739 --> 30:26.034
Give us arrows. I give axe. Quick, mate.

30:26.117 --> 30:28.369
Thank you, mate.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.923
Gangway for the mail, please.

30:41.049 --> 30:44.469
Here we are. Very important mail. Letters.

30:44.552 --> 30:47.847
What's he saying?

30:51.434 --> 30:55.271
A large man-of-war, French, stopped here
on the 10th, then headed south.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.862
Somewhere here.

31:02.946 --> 31:05.532
A full three weeks ahead.

31:05.615 --> 31:07.492
Damn.

31:08.409 --> 31:11.204
All right, Tom, let's get all this squared away.

31:11.287 --> 31:15.208
Aye, sir. Mr Hollar.
Let us complete our business here.

31:15.291 --> 31:18.044
Hands, prepare to weigh anchor.

31:20.004 --> 31:27.220
Put that woman down, Slade. This is a ship
of His Majesty's Navy, not a floating bordello.

31:30.014 --> 31:34.018
All hands, get these provisions stowed.

31:46.614 --> 31:48.241
Well done.

31:48.324 --> 31:50.410
Gentlemen.

31:51.411 --> 31:56.416
To wives and to sweethearts.

31:56.499 --> 31:59.878
May they never meet.

31:59.961 --> 32:03.882
Mr Howard, the bottle.
The bottle stands by you, sir.

32:04.465 --> 32:06.801
Sir?

32:07.635 --> 32:12.223
Excuse me, sir, but Mr Blakeney said that
you served under Lord Nelson at the Nile.

32:12.307 --> 32:17.228
Indeed. I was a young lieutenant,
not much older than you are now.

32:17.312 --> 32:20.899
And Mr Pullings was
a snivelling midshipman,

32:20.982 --> 32:23.359
still yearning for hearth and home.

32:23.443 --> 32:26.613
Did you meet him, sir?
Can you tell me what he's like?

32:26.696 --> 32:29.824
I have had the honour
of dining with him twice.

32:29.908 --> 32:32.785
He spoke to me on both occasions.

32:32.869 --> 32:36.039
A master tactician
and a man of singular vision.

32:36.122 --> 32:41.377
He always said in battle "Never mind
the manoeuvres, just go straight at 'em."

32:41.461 --> 32:45.632
Some would say not a great seaman,
but a great leader.

32:45.715 --> 32:48.760
He's England's only hope
if old Boney intends to invade.

32:48.843 --> 32:52.222
Sir, might we press you for an anecdote?

32:55.183 --> 32:58.269
The first time that he spoke to me,

32:58.353 --> 33:03.566
I shall never forget his words.
I remember it like it was yesterday.

33:03.650 --> 33:07.403
He leaned across the table,
he looked me straight in the eye,

33:07.487 --> 33:12.158
and he said "Aubrey,
may I trouble you for the salt?"

33:14.202 --> 33:19.374
I've always tried to say it
exactly as he did ever since.

33:25.171 --> 33:30.552
The second time,
the second time he told me a story

33:30.635 --> 33:34.180
about how someone offered him
a boat cloak on a cold night.

33:34.264 --> 33:39.143
And he said no, he didn't need it.
That he was quite warm.

33:39.227 --> 33:43.898
His zeal for king and country kept him warm.

33:43.982 --> 33:48.027
I know it sounds absurd,
and were it from another man,

33:48.111 --> 33:53.408
you'd cry out "What pitiful stuff"
and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm.

33:53.491 --> 33:55.577
But with Nelson,

33:57.453 --> 34:00.290
you felt your heart glow.

34:06.629 --> 34:11.592
- Wouldn't you say, Mr Pullings?
- You did indeed, sir.

34:12.176 --> 34:18.641
Well then, he would seem to be the exception
to the rule that authority corrupts.

34:18.725 --> 34:22.061
To Lord Nelson.

34:25.815 --> 34:29.194
Do you see those two weevils, Doctor?

34:29.277 --> 34:30.820
I do.

34:30.904 --> 34:33.239
Which would you choose?

34:34.282 --> 34:40.163
Neither. There's no difference between them.
They're the same species of curculio.

34:40.246 --> 34:42.665
If you had to choose.

34:42.748 --> 34:46.210
If you were forced to make a choice.
If there was no other...

34:46.293 --> 34:49.922
Well then, if you're going to push me,

34:52.217 --> 34:55.219
I would choose the right-hand weevil.

34:55.303 --> 34:59.057
It has significant advantage
in both length and breadth.

34:59.140 --> 35:02.477
There, I have you.
You're completely dished.

35:02.560 --> 35:08.483
Do you not know that in the service one must
always choose the lesser of two weevils?

35:15.156 --> 35:18.576
He who would pun would pick a pocket.

35:20.078 --> 35:22.330
Really. Weevils.

35:22.413 --> 35:27.752
To the lesser of two weevils.

35:38.388 --> 35:41.349
Yay, Joe.

35:43.893 --> 35:45.979
Go on, Joe.

36:04.622 --> 36:06.916
The Lord taketh,

36:08.126 --> 36:11.045
and the Lord giveth away.

36:11.129 --> 36:14.007
You hear that? He said something.

36:14.090 --> 36:16.968
Doctor. He spoke, Doctor.

36:17.051 --> 36:18.970
Well done indeed, Stephen.

36:19.053 --> 36:22.056
Adieu to you Spanish ladies

36:22.140 --> 36:26.269
Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain

36:26.352 --> 36:31.274
For we've received orders
to sail for old England

36:31.357 --> 36:37.530
We hope in a short time
to see you again

36:38.406 --> 36:42.577
What a wonderfully true voice
Mr Hollom possesses.

36:42.660 --> 36:45.205
Indeed.

36:46.331 --> 36:49.042
Come, all you bold young thoughtless men

36:49.125 --> 36:51.628
A warning take by me

36:51.711 --> 36:56.216
And never leave your happy homes
to sail the raging sea

37:08.061 --> 37:11.189
On deck there. Sail ho.

37:12.148 --> 37:14.359
Looks like a frigate.

37:18.947 --> 37:21.074
How did it get there?

37:21.157 --> 37:24.827
- We must turn and fight.
- But he has the weather gauge again.

37:24.911 --> 37:28.206
He must've been watching us
from some inlet.

37:32.168 --> 37:35.713
My God. What can we do?
He has us by the hip.

37:35.797 --> 37:37.799
Run like smoke and oakum.

37:37.882 --> 37:41.803
- We'll have to bend every sail.
- We'll put up our handkerchiefs if we have to.

37:41.886 --> 37:45.848
We must survive this day.
Let's get about it. Mr Allen, gentlemen.

37:45.932 --> 37:47.976
All hands, make sail.

37:48.059 --> 37:52.981
This is the second time he's done this to me.
There will not be a third.

38:08.872 --> 38:14.627
I tell ya, the devil's at the wheel
of that there phantom ship.

38:14.711 --> 38:17.130
You better hold fast.

38:23.386 --> 38:25.555
What is it with this man?

38:25.638 --> 38:31.436
Did I kill a relative of his in battle, perhaps?
His boy, God forbid?

38:31.519 --> 38:33.563
He fights like you, Jack.

38:52.165 --> 38:55.084
Bring the sun down to the horizon.

38:55.168 --> 38:59.380
When its lower limb is touching the horizon...
Williamson, look to your sextant.

38:59.464 --> 39:03.343
When the orb is no longer rising,

39:03.426 --> 39:07.013
then it has reached its zenith
and that would be noon.

39:07.096 --> 39:09.474
- Sir?
- Mr Pullings.

39:09.557 --> 39:11.768
- Do you make noon, Mr Hollom?
- Yes, sir.

39:11.851 --> 39:14.354
Call noon. It's your class.

39:16.648 --> 39:20.026
- Sir, that's noon.
- Mr Nichols, make that twelve.

39:20.109 --> 39:22.445
Six hours?

39:22.529 --> 39:24.781
Five at most.

39:24.864 --> 39:28.826
Just keep us out of her reach until nightfall.

39:36.960 --> 39:41.881
She's to look like us, lads, don't forget.
Jibbo, make fast those whips.

39:41.965 --> 39:45.426
We didn't want to make it any taller,
on account of this wind.

39:45.510 --> 39:51.599
- Excuse me, sir, but what are they building?
- Your first command.

39:57.522 --> 39:59.899
Quickly. She'll be on top of us.

39:59.983 --> 40:02.902
Take the weight on the yard tackles.

40:02.986 --> 40:05.280
Fend her off.

40:05.363 --> 40:07.866
Lower away on the main.

40:14.831 --> 40:18.001
- Wouldn't want to lose you.
- Aye, sir.

40:29.095 --> 40:34.642
There's a painter. Pass her aft.
Outside everything, mind.

40:34.726 --> 40:39.022
Lively now.
We've not ten minutes before he's up with us.

40:45.195 --> 40:49.032
- Mind what the captain told you.
- Pull, boys. That's it.

41:12.597 --> 41:13.640
Now.

41:19.312 --> 41:22.232
Killick there. Douse your light.

41:28.655 --> 41:30.281
Mr Allen, make ready.

42:11.406 --> 42:13.908
Hello. We caught a fish.

42:15.451 --> 42:17.370
Take the helm, Bonden.

42:17.453 --> 42:21.165
- Now, tell me that wasn't fun.
- Yes, sir.

42:22.917 --> 42:25.628
Hard a'larboard.

42:54.532 --> 42:59.037
Stand the men down, Mr Pullings.
I'll take this watch.

42:59.120 --> 43:00.747
Aye, sir.

43:00.830 --> 43:05.418
Mr Mowett, Mr Allen, calmly now.
You know his orders.

43:05.501 --> 43:07.587
Well done, sir.

43:09.380 --> 43:13.968
She's a right phantom, she is. The way
she come up again, right behind us like that.

43:14.052 --> 43:19.390
Out of nowhere. And right behind us.
Like that first time, out the fog.

43:19.474 --> 43:21.976
With our shot bouncin' off her.

43:22.060 --> 43:25.021
Captain's not called Lucky Jack for no reason.

43:25.104 --> 43:29.192
Phantom or no, she's a privateer,
and Lucky Jack'll have her.

43:29.275 --> 43:32.195
You need more than luck 'gainst a phantom.

43:33.988 --> 43:37.242
- Is she like a pirate?
- No, they're not pirates, Lofty.

43:37.325 --> 43:41.871
Oh, no. If they were,
we could hang them when we catch 'em.

43:41.955 --> 43:44.749
Privateer gets a piece of paper
from the Frenchies

43:44.832 --> 43:47.502
says they can hunt down
anything with our flag.

43:47.585 --> 43:51.256
They go after rich merchantmen and the like.

43:51.339 --> 43:55.093
But think on our share of the prize money.

43:55.176 --> 44:00.181
She'll be loaded with gold
and ambergris and all the gems of Araby.

44:00.265 --> 44:03.768
That's all very well, Nagle.
Got to get home to spend it, but.

44:03.851 --> 44:06.187
Never met a dead man
who bought me a drink.

44:06.271 --> 44:10.233
And I've never met a live one
that you bought one for, neither.

44:11.609 --> 44:17.740
Sitting up all night, catching your death
of cold. That's the last of the coffee, too.

44:17.824 --> 44:19.909
Thank you, Killick.

44:24.247 --> 44:26.291
Bonden.

44:26.374 --> 44:29.544
That's enough easting.
Set a course sou'-sou'west.

44:29.627 --> 44:33.631
Aye, sir. Sou'-sou'west.

44:37.677 --> 44:40.138
Sail.

44:40.221 --> 44:43.433
Two points off starboard bow.

44:43.975 --> 44:46.436
Three cheers for Lucky Jack.

44:52.567 --> 44:54.944
She's ours, boys.

45:04.704 --> 45:08.875
Foul. You got away before me.

45:13.046 --> 45:16.007
- Set royals and courses.
- Sir.

45:16.090 --> 45:18.593
Have the idlers placed along the rails.

45:18.676 --> 45:20.637
I've never seen the like.

45:20.720 --> 45:24.682
It has to be more than 100 sea miles
and he brings us up on his tail.

45:24.766 --> 45:28.937
That's seamanship, Mr Pullings.
My God, that's seamanship.

45:29.020 --> 45:32.357
Told you it would work, Will.
We'll have them by nightfall.

45:32.440 --> 45:35.944
- I think we've got him, sir.
- And the wind favours us this time.

45:36.027 --> 45:39.322
Don't count your eggs
before they're in the pudding.

45:39.405 --> 45:44.327
Still, if we can close this gap
and get up behind her, she may well be ours.

45:44.410 --> 45:46.788
Touch wood. Scratch a stay.

45:47.413 --> 45:50.875
Turn three times.
May the Lord and saints preserve us.

46:06.474 --> 46:08.184
Turn.

46:08.268 --> 46:12.105
Move along, man.
We'll have lost him before you rig it up.

46:12.188 --> 46:14.315
Hold.

46:15.108 --> 46:18.695
- 12 knots, sir.
- That's 12 knots. That's good.

46:18.778 --> 46:23.449
I want more. Have all the spare hands
placed on the windward rail.

46:23.533 --> 46:26.828
Mr Hollar. Rouse up the off-watch.

46:27.787 --> 46:31.124
All hands on starboard rail.

46:31.791 --> 46:35.169
Come up the larboard topsail sheets.

46:52.812 --> 46:57.275
- We're crackin' on.
- We'll be crackin' up if he don't watch it.

46:57.358 --> 47:01.988
Captain knows this ship.
He knows what she can take.

47:06.159 --> 47:10.580
Mr Hollar, I want lifelines fore and aft.

47:10.663 --> 47:12.373
No lounging, boy.

47:12.457 --> 47:18.171
Lifelines, fore and aft.
Double-grape that launch.

47:20.381 --> 47:22.800
Cape Horn, Doctor.

47:38.608 --> 47:41.611
Close the lid.
There's enough water in the grog.

47:41.694 --> 47:43.571
Thank you for that, Davies.

47:43.655 --> 47:48.535
Reckon the captain will follow him
round the Horn, every stitch of canvas flying?

47:48.618 --> 47:51.079
I reckon he'd follow him to the gates of hell.

47:51.162 --> 47:55.708
It's a devil ship, I tell ya.
And it's leadin' us right into a trap.

47:59.087 --> 48:01.965
She's making a run for the Horn, sir.

48:02.048 --> 48:05.009
I'll not vouch for this mast.
Not around the Horn.

48:05.093 --> 48:08.137
Thank you. Your comments
will be noted in the log.

48:08.221 --> 48:14.477
Sail trimmers to their stations.
Get the sails off her, lads. She's over-pressed.

48:14.561 --> 48:16.729
Give 'em a pull and belay.

48:32.203 --> 48:35.707
We're closing on her, Tom.
I'll not give up now.

48:35.790 --> 48:39.043
Come up on the wind, Barret.
Set a course sou'west by west.

48:39.127 --> 48:41.754
Sou'west by west, sir.

48:42.922 --> 48:44.632
Mr Calamy.

48:44.716 --> 48:47.427
Idlers and waisters below.

48:51.222 --> 48:54.017
We're for the Horn, boys.

48:57.979 --> 48:59.939
Close reef topsails.

49:13.453 --> 49:15.205
Lively, lads.

49:19.500 --> 49:24.297
Batten down those hatches
before we're on the bottom.

49:33.890 --> 49:36.684
Johansson, Truelove. To the mizzen.

49:38.102 --> 49:40.021
All secure.

49:40.104 --> 49:42.065
Down ye go, lads.

49:48.530 --> 49:53.243
Mr Hollom, help young Warley
on the mizzen topgallant.

49:56.704 --> 50:00.083
- I'll need more men, sir.
- Yes. Go.

50:08.424 --> 50:12.136
Mr Hollom, sir. Help me.

50:18.935 --> 50:22.605
Tudor, Ellers. To Mr Allen.

50:22.689 --> 50:27.694
You men, lay aloft.
The mizzen topgallant. Light along.

50:35.618 --> 50:37.704
Help.

50:40.748 --> 50:42.792
Help me.

50:48.673 --> 50:51.426
Man overboard.

50:52.594 --> 50:57.098
Mizzen's gone. Hands to the taffrail.

51:08.193 --> 51:11.070
He's over there, sir.

51:11.154 --> 51:14.824
Swim for the wreckage, man. Swim.

51:15.617 --> 51:17.327
Over here.

51:17.410 --> 51:22.707
Mr Allen, gratings and barrels,
anything that floats, overboard.

51:22.790 --> 51:26.920
She's broaching. We're losing her.

51:27.003 --> 51:30.340
Sir, the wreckage is acting as a sea anchor.

51:30.423 --> 51:33.968
We must cut it loose.
It's going to sink us.

51:34.052 --> 51:37.889
Sir, he's going to make it. He can do it.

51:37.972 --> 51:42.018
- Come on, Will.
- Come on. Hand over hand.

51:42.101 --> 51:47.273
For God's sake, Will, swim.
Swim for the wreckage, Will.

51:55.907 --> 51:57.825
You can do it, Will.

51:57.909 --> 52:02.080
- Swim. Come on.
- Come on, Will. Swim.

54:31.729 --> 54:35.149
- He's been at it again.
- Who's that, then?

54:35.233 --> 54:38.069
- The Jonah.
- What's that?

54:48.454 --> 54:52.917
The deaths in actual battle
are the easiest to bear.

54:53.626 --> 55:00.675
For my own part, those who die under my
knife, or from some subsequent infection,

55:00.758 --> 55:06.681
I have to remind myself that it was
the enemy that killed them, not me.

55:08.850 --> 55:11.477
That young man was a casualty of war.

55:14.189 --> 55:18.443
As you said yourself,
you have to choose the lesser of two evils.

55:18.526 --> 55:20.612
Weevils.

55:24.032 --> 55:28.453
The crew will take it badly.
Warley was popular.

55:28.536 --> 55:32.624
Have they expressed
any feelings on the matter to you?

55:39.881 --> 55:42.926
Jack, before answering,
I'm compelled to ask,

55:43.009 --> 55:47.138
am I speaking with my old friend
or to the ship's captain?

55:48.223 --> 55:51.851
To the captain I'd say
there's little I detest more than an informer.

55:51.935 --> 55:55.188
- Now you're talking like an Irishman.
- I am an Irishman.

55:55.271 --> 55:57.315
As a friend, then.

55:57.398 --> 56:03.238
As a friend, I would say that I have never once
doubted your abilities as a captain.

56:03.321 --> 56:05.240
Speak plainly, Stephen.

56:07.033 --> 56:11.746
Perhaps we should have
turned back weeks ago.

56:11.829 --> 56:15.708
The men, of course
they would follow Lucky Jack anywhere,

56:15.792 --> 56:18.044
rightfully confident of victory.

56:18.127 --> 56:23.758
But therein lies the problem.
You're not accustomed to defeat.

56:25.301 --> 56:31.516
And chasing this larger, faster ship with
its long guns is beginning to smack of pride.

56:31.599 --> 56:35.019
It's not a question of pride.
It is a question of duty.

56:35.103 --> 56:37.564
Duty. Yes, I've heard it well spoken of.

56:37.647 --> 56:42.277
Be as satiric as you like. Viewing the world
through a microscope is your prerogative.

56:42.360 --> 56:46.906
This is a ship of war. I will grind whatever
grist the mill requires to fulfil my duty.

56:46.990 --> 56:49.367
Whatever the cost?

56:49.450 --> 56:51.703
Whatever the cost.

56:51.786 --> 56:54.581
To follow orders with no regard for cost.

56:54.664 --> 56:58.960
Can you really claim there's
nothing personal in this call to duty?

56:59.043 --> 57:01.546
Orders are subject
to the requirement of the service.

57:01.629 --> 57:07.927
My orders were to follow him as far as Brazil.
I exceeded my orders a long time ago.

57:10.138 --> 57:12.223
Got it.

57:15.768 --> 57:18.771
The wind's backing, sir.

57:18.855 --> 57:22.901
Sir, we just can't hold
this westerly course any longer.

57:23.484 --> 57:29.532
If we can't sail through the damn wind, Tom,
we'll bloody well sail around it. Due south.

57:29.616 --> 57:32.619
How far south, sir?

57:32.702 --> 57:36.247
As far as is necessary, Mr Pullings.

57:36.331 --> 57:38.791
- Aye, sir.
- Lively.

57:39.876 --> 57:44.047
- Due south, please, Mr Bonden.
- Due south, sir.

57:46.591 --> 57:49.761
Heave. Steady.

58:25.046 --> 58:29.384
Clearly something nautical and fascinating
just happened. I am at a loss.

58:29.467 --> 58:33.972
We have made our turn northward.
We are headed back toward the sun.

58:34.055 --> 58:36.140
To the sun.

58:38.768 --> 58:42.397
And by way of anticipation of this event,

58:42.480 --> 58:48.111
I have asked Killick
to prepare something special.

58:48.194 --> 58:52.490
- Killick. Killick there.
- I'm already here, ain't I?

58:54.993 --> 58:59.205
Gentlemen, I give you,

58:59.998 --> 59:02.292
our destination.

59:08.590 --> 59:12.343
- It's the Galápagos Islands.
- The Galápagos Islands.

59:14.929 --> 59:17.223
Our whaling fleet is there.

59:17.307 --> 59:22.770
And their cargo would put a pretty penny
into old Bones-aparte's invasion purse.

59:22.854 --> 59:28.568
That's where the <i>Acheron</i> will be.
Sure as there's carts to horses.

59:28.651 --> 59:31.321
So, Mr Pullings, if you'll permit me,

59:31.404 --> 59:34.407
a slice of Albemarle.

59:35.366 --> 59:38.995
And for you, Doctor, Redondo Rock.

59:39.078 --> 59:40.413
Perfect.

59:40.496 --> 59:43.249
And the <i>Acheron</i> for me.

59:49.422 --> 59:54.677
Safe and sound at home again
Let the waters roar, Jack

59:54.761 --> 59:59.724
Safe and sound at home again
Let the waters roar, Jack

59:59.807 --> 01:00:06.064
Long we tossed on the rolling main
Now we're safe ashore, Jack

01:00:06.147 --> 01:00:11.486
Don't forget your old shipmates

01:00:11.569 --> 01:00:16.991
We have worked the selfsame gun
Quarterdeck division

01:00:17.075 --> 01:00:22.747
Sponger I, and loader you
Through the whole commission

01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:29.212
Long we tossed on the rolling main
Now we're safe ashore, Jack

01:00:29.295 --> 01:00:36.553
Don't forget your old shipmates

01:01:20.847 --> 01:01:27.687
The Enchanted Isles. They're said
to be full of strange and wonderful beasts.

01:01:28.521 --> 01:01:31.608
When we get there,
we'll have to stop for food and water.

01:01:31.691 --> 01:01:35.653
I promise you, during that time -
several days at least -

01:01:35.737 --> 01:01:40.158
you can wander at will, collecting bugs
and beetles to your heart's content.

01:01:40.241 --> 01:01:44.746
You'll be the first naturalist
to set foot on the islands, I'll wager.

01:01:44.829 --> 01:01:48.208
I would like that of all things.

01:01:51.836 --> 01:01:55.089
- Is it an insect?
- Yes.

01:01:56.925 --> 01:02:01.763
Doesn't look like one.
I mean, it looks like a stick.

01:02:02.555 --> 01:02:04.933
Yes, that's the whole point.

01:02:05.016 --> 01:02:08.978
It's disguised itself in order to survive.

01:02:12.982 --> 01:02:17.654
There's a spider
that's disguised itself as an ant.

01:02:17.737 --> 01:02:25.036
And here's an insect that's taken on the shape
of a thorn to save itself from the birds.

01:02:26.538 --> 01:02:28.748
Did God make them change?

01:02:28.831 --> 01:02:32.210
Does God make them change?
Yes, certainly.

01:02:32.293 --> 01:02:35.755
But do they also change themselves?

01:02:35.838 --> 01:02:38.633
Now that is a question, isn't it?

01:02:40.718 --> 01:02:43.388
Sir, we've raised the Galápagos.

01:02:43.471 --> 01:02:45.557
I'm coming.

01:03:20.425 --> 01:03:24.220
- Look. Beyond the rock.
- Yes, I see.

01:03:24.304 --> 01:03:27.974
What is it? Curious, eh?
Some type of gull?

01:03:28.057 --> 01:03:33.521
- There's an ugly devil.
- Disgusting. It's got warts all over it.

01:03:33.605 --> 01:03:36.566
Ugly devils, aren't they?

01:03:37.525 --> 01:03:40.195
I can't see any women.
Just ducks and lizards.

01:03:40.278 --> 01:03:43.198
What, no women? It ain't natural.

01:03:44.532 --> 01:03:46.409
How extraordinary.

01:03:46.492 --> 01:03:48.328
What is, sir?

01:03:48.411 --> 01:03:52.457
Those birds. They're a species of cormorant,
but they are flightless.

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:55.210
Do you see their underdeveloped wings?

01:03:55.293 --> 01:03:58.880
By all that's holy,
I think that's unknown to science.

01:03:58.963 --> 01:04:02.759
The dragons don't seem to bother them.

01:04:03.384 --> 01:04:07.847
They're a type of iguana, I should think.
Therefore, they're vegetarian.

01:04:07.931 --> 01:04:11.017
- Will you catch one?
- A pair of them, I should think.

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:14.312
Then you can present
one of their offspring to the king.

01:04:14.395 --> 01:04:18.107
- Look. There's one going for a swim.
- Iguanas don't swim.

01:04:18.191 --> 01:04:20.443
These ones do.

01:04:29.494 --> 01:04:31.621
I'll be damned.

01:04:31.704 --> 01:04:37.961
Two new species in as many minutes.
That's remarkable.

01:05:01.359 --> 01:05:06.322
All hands about ship. Off tacks and sheets.
Prepare the mainsail to haul.

01:05:15.582 --> 01:05:19.168
- Aubrey.
- Hogg. Master of the <i>Albatross.</i>

01:05:19.252 --> 01:05:22.714
God bless you, Captain.
God bless you all.

01:05:23.715 --> 01:05:26.676
- Mr Calamy, food and water for these men.
- Aye, sir.

01:05:26.759 --> 01:05:30.221
- Mr Howard, stand your men down.
- Royal Marines, trail arms.

01:05:31.097 --> 01:05:34.142
We was coming back for fresh lines
no more than a week ago.

01:05:34.225 --> 01:05:39.689
Hid in that inlet yonder. Burnt our bloody
ship to the waterline. Fucking pirates.

01:05:39.772 --> 01:05:42.066
Crew prisoner, captain dead.

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:46.279
She were a big black three-master.
Break your heart, it would.

01:05:46.362 --> 01:05:51.576
£12,000 sterling of the finest grade oil they
took. We been out more than two years.

01:05:51.659 --> 01:05:53.578
And her course?

01:05:53.661 --> 01:05:56.831
Maybe a point south of west,
following the rest of the fleet.

01:05:56.915 --> 01:06:00.126
Mr Pullings, enter these men's names
into the ship's books.

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:03.421
Mr Allen, set a course. West by south.

01:06:03.504 --> 01:06:05.757
All hands, make sail.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.885
Sir, should we not take on fresh provisions?

01:06:08.968 --> 01:06:12.096
Mr Mowett, there's not a moment to lose.

01:06:27.237 --> 01:06:32.283
- Have you forgotten your promise?
- Subject to the requirements of the service.

01:06:32.367 --> 01:06:35.578
I cannot delay for the sake
of an iguana or a giant peccary.

01:06:35.662 --> 01:06:39.123
Fascinating, no doubt,
but of no immediate application.

01:06:39.207 --> 01:06:43.253
There is, I think, an opportunity here
to serve both our purposes.

01:06:43.336 --> 01:06:46.464
As I understand it, this is a long, thin island.

01:06:46.548 --> 01:06:50.093
You need to sail around it.
I could walk across it.

01:06:50.176 --> 01:06:54.097
I have known you to spend hours
staring into a deserted bird's nest.

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:58.142
I could walk briskly, pausing only
for important measurements.

01:06:58.226 --> 01:07:02.397
Making discoveries that could advance
our knowledge of natural history.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:06.568
If wind and tide had been against us,
I should have said yes.

01:07:06.651 --> 01:07:09.863
They're not. I'm obliged to say no.

01:07:11.531 --> 01:07:15.243
I see. So after all this time in your service,

01:07:15.326 --> 01:07:20.206
I must simply content myself
to form part of this belligerent expedition,

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:25.295
hurry past wonders, bent on destruction.
I say nothing of the corruption of power...

01:07:25.378 --> 01:07:28.965
- You forget yourself, Doctor.
- No, Jack.

01:07:29.048 --> 01:07:33.344
You've forgotten yourself. For my part,
I look upon a promise as binding.

01:07:33.428 --> 01:07:37.765
The promise was conditional.
I command a king's ship, not a private yacht.

01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:41.978
We do not have time for
your damned hobbies, sir.

01:08:09.923 --> 01:08:12.383
All right.

01:08:14.344 --> 01:08:19.933
Get those fish below.
Sluice down this deck.

01:08:20.015 --> 01:08:23.269
Davies, don't leave them there.
Get them below.

01:08:23.353 --> 01:08:25.020
Mr Blakeney.

01:08:25.104 --> 01:08:29.317
Sir, I found a curious beetle
walking along the deck.

01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:35.365
I think it's a Galápagos beetle.

01:08:36.407 --> 01:08:38.158
I'm sure of it.

01:08:39.327 --> 01:08:44.541
Were you to walk all day on the island,
you might never come across it.

01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:50.046
Yes, that is more than likely sure.

01:08:50.796 --> 01:08:53.216
You can have it, sir.

01:09:09.607 --> 01:09:12.193
Mr Blakeney.

01:09:13.403 --> 01:09:16.406
- Thank you.
- Sir.

01:09:29.877 --> 01:09:31.880
Last gun fired, sir.

01:09:31.962 --> 01:09:35.591
- Timing?
- Two minutes and one second, sir.

01:09:35.675 --> 01:09:41.014
Lads, that's not good enough.
We need to fire two broadsides to her one.

01:09:41.096 --> 01:09:44.309
- Want to see a guillotine in Piccadilly?
- No.

01:09:44.392 --> 01:09:47.604
- Do you want to call Napoleon your king?
- No.

01:09:47.687 --> 01:09:50.439
- Want your children to sing <i>The Marseillaise?</i>
- No.

01:09:50.523 --> 01:09:53.776
Mr Mowett, Mr Pullings, starboard battery.

01:09:56.821 --> 01:10:00.116
Jump to it, lads. Cadence and rhythm.

01:10:02.785 --> 01:10:06.122
- Mark your targets.
- Come on, lads, faster now.

01:10:06.206 --> 01:10:08.291
Come on, swab it.

01:10:20.094 --> 01:10:22.514
Heave.

01:10:22.597 --> 01:10:25.808
- Report, Mr Mowett.
- Third and fourth divisions ready.

01:10:25.892 --> 01:10:28.770
Right. Starboard battery, fire!

01:11:02.637 --> 01:11:04.848
One minute and ten seconds.

01:11:06.683 --> 01:11:09.352
Well done, lads.
Extra grog for all of you.

01:11:13.481 --> 01:11:15.942
Gangway for the captain, lads.

01:11:16.025 --> 01:11:18.695
Marked improvement, Mr Calamy. Well done.

01:11:18.778 --> 01:11:20.864
Thank you, sir.

01:11:27.245 --> 01:11:32.667
Killick. Killick there.
What do you have for us tonight?

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:35.295
Which it's soused hog's face.

01:11:35.378 --> 01:11:40.049
- Which it is soused hog's face.
- My favourite.

01:11:40.133 --> 01:11:46.764
And when they run, the <i>Surprise</i>
will blow her to kingdom come.

01:12:43.112 --> 01:12:46.491
One more week of this and
they'd give it up for a cup of water.

01:12:46.574 --> 01:12:48.743
I can't make it rain.

01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:54.165
I can harness the wind,
but I ain't its goddamn creator.

01:12:54.249 --> 01:12:56.834
I have never known such a run of bad luck.

01:13:13.268 --> 01:13:19.190
"And they said unto him
'For what caused the evil?"'

01:13:23.027 --> 01:13:25.363
Where'd that come from?

01:13:26.281 --> 01:13:31.202
It's from the Bible, that. That is
from the Bible. The story of the Jonah.

01:13:31.286 --> 01:13:35.164
They found out on their ship
that one of their men - this Jonah cove -

01:13:35.248 --> 01:13:38.293
he'd offended God
and was the cause of all their bad luck.

01:13:38.376 --> 01:13:44.007
Evil comes from him
who evil thinks and evil is.

01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:48.803
No. Joe knows a thing or two about evil.

01:13:49.679 --> 01:13:53.349
From personal experience. Right, Joe?

01:14:05.069 --> 01:14:10.491
It's like Killick says. Morning of the battle,
he doesn't have the guts to beat to quarters.

01:14:10.575 --> 01:14:15.205
Then his entire gun crew's killed.
Soon as he went up the mizzen, Will falls.

01:14:15.288 --> 01:14:19.083
And whose watch was it
when we lost our wind?

01:14:41.439 --> 01:14:44.067
You there. Stand fast.

01:14:46.194 --> 01:14:50.365
Master-at-arms, take that man below
and clap him in irons.

01:14:50.448 --> 01:14:53.993
Mr Pullings, defaulters at eight bells.

01:14:54.077 --> 01:14:55.787
Aye, sir.

01:14:57.205 --> 01:15:00.542
Bring Hollom down to my cabin.

01:15:04.546 --> 01:15:07.840
A man pushed past you,
yet you said nothing. Why?

01:15:07.924 --> 01:15:10.844
I intended to, sir, but the right words didn't...

01:15:10.927 --> 01:15:16.140
The right words?
He was deliberately insubordinate.

01:15:16.224 --> 01:15:19.310
I've tried to get to know the men, sir,
and be friendly,

01:15:19.394 --> 01:15:22.856
but they've taken a set against me.

01:15:23.523 --> 01:15:28.361
Always whispering when I go past
and giving me looks.

01:15:28.444 --> 01:15:31.364
I'll set that to rights.
I'll be much tougher on them.

01:15:31.447 --> 01:15:34.993
You don't make friends
with the foremastjacks, lad.

01:15:35.076 --> 01:15:39.372
They'll despise you in the end,
think you weak.

01:15:39.455 --> 01:15:43.167
- Nor do you need to be a tyrant.
- No, sir.

01:15:43.251 --> 01:15:45.545
I'm very sorry, sir.

01:15:45.628 --> 01:15:49.048
- You're 26? 27?
- I'm 30 next Friday, sir.

01:15:49.132 --> 01:15:50.717
30?

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.053
You've failed to pass for lieutenant twice.

01:15:54.137 --> 01:15:59.017
I know you have, but you're not a bad sailor.
You can't spend your life a midshipman.

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:02.729
No, sir. I will try much harder, sir.

01:16:04.272 --> 01:16:07.692
Look, Hollom, it's leadership they want.

01:16:07.775 --> 01:16:09.819
Strength.

01:16:09.903 --> 01:16:15.366
You find that within yourself,
and you will earn their respect.

01:16:16.951 --> 01:16:20.538
Without respect,
true discipline goes by the board.

01:16:21.623 --> 01:16:24.417
Yes, sir.

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:29.589
Strength, respect and discipline, sir.

01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:37.472
It's an unfortunate business, Hollom.

01:16:38.473 --> 01:16:41.309
Damned unfortunate.

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:44.938
- That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.

01:16:48.191 --> 01:16:52.195
- I am not a flogging captain.
- Hollom is a scapegoat for all the bad luck,

01:16:52.278 --> 01:16:55.573
real or imagined, on this voyage.

01:16:55.657 --> 01:16:58.201
Mr Lamb? If you please.

01:16:58.284 --> 01:17:01.538
They're exhausted.
These men are exhausted.

01:17:01.621 --> 01:17:04.499
You've pushed them too hard.

01:17:04.582 --> 01:17:08.253
Stephen, I invite you
to this cabin as my friend.

01:17:08.336 --> 01:17:12.632
Not to criticise nor to comment
on my command.

01:17:12.715 --> 01:17:18.263
Shall I leave you until you're in
a more harmonious frame of mind?

01:17:19.514 --> 01:17:23.309
- What would you have me do?
- Tip the ship's grog over the side.

01:17:23.393 --> 01:17:26.855
- Stop their grog?
- Nagle was drunk when he insulted Hollom.

01:17:26.938 --> 01:17:30.233
Stop 200 years of privilege and tradition.

01:17:30.316 --> 01:17:33.486
I'd rather have them three sheets to the wind
than face a mutiny.

01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:35.864
I'm rather understanding of mutinies.

01:17:35.947 --> 01:17:40.785
Men pressed from their homes, confined
for months aboard a wooden prison...

01:17:40.869 --> 01:17:47.667
I respect your right to disagree with me,
but I can only afford one rebel on this ship.

01:17:49.085 --> 01:17:53.381
I hate it when you talk of the service
in this way. It makes me so very low.

01:17:53.464 --> 01:17:55.216
You think I want to flog Nagle?

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:58.887
A man who hacked the ropes
that sent his mate to his death?

01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:01.848
Under my orders?

01:18:01.931 --> 01:18:06.269
Do you not see? The only things that keep
this wooden world together are hard work...

01:18:06.352 --> 01:18:08.771
Jack, the man failed to salute.

01:18:08.855 --> 01:18:11.566
There's hierarchies even in nature.

01:18:11.649 --> 01:18:16.905
- There is no disdain in nature. There is no...
- Men must be governed.

01:18:16.988 --> 01:18:19.532
Often not wisely, but governed nonetheless.

01:18:19.616 --> 01:18:23.912
That's the excuse of every tyrant in history,
from Nero to Bonaparte.

01:18:23.995 --> 01:18:28.124
I, for one, am opposed to authority.
It is an egg of misery and oppression.

01:18:28.208 --> 01:18:32.670
You've come to the wrong shop
for anarchy, brother.

01:18:35.506 --> 01:18:37.342
Four.

01:18:38.801 --> 01:18:40.178
Five.

01:18:42.472 --> 01:18:44.140
Six.

01:18:45.391 --> 01:18:47.185
Seven.

01:18:48.436 --> 01:18:49.979
Eight.

01:18:50.688 --> 01:18:52.440
Nine.

01:18:54.817 --> 01:18:56.694
Ten.

01:18:57.779 --> 01:18:58.988
Eleven.

01:19:01.032 --> 01:19:02.992
Twelve.

01:19:05.995 --> 01:19:08.206
Cut him down.

01:19:32.146 --> 01:19:34.524
Not so loud.

01:20:28.661 --> 01:20:31.331
Put that dirk down, Boyle.

01:20:33.833 --> 01:20:36.419
You OK, Mr Hollom?

01:20:36.502 --> 01:20:39.589
- He's not ill, just dodging work as usual.
- Shut up.

01:20:39.672 --> 01:20:42.759
- You shut up.
- Just leave him be.

01:20:42.842 --> 01:20:45.845
- Have some water.
- Thank you.

01:20:50.058 --> 01:20:52.393
Sir, it's Mr Hollom.

01:20:59.526 --> 01:21:05.490
There's nothing physically wrong with him.
He thinks he's been cursed.

01:21:07.242 --> 01:21:10.954
Sailors can abide a great deal,
but not a Jonah.

01:21:11.621 --> 01:21:14.707
My God. You believe it too.

01:21:16.376 --> 01:21:19.837
Not everything is in your books, Stephen.

01:21:26.344 --> 01:21:28.263
It's him, innit?

01:21:30.849 --> 01:21:33.852
The Jonah.

01:21:33.935 --> 01:21:35.937
He's causing it.

01:21:38.439 --> 01:21:41.693
He's callin' it up, don't you see?

01:21:41.776 --> 01:21:46.447
Every time he's on watch, that ship appears.

01:21:49.909 --> 01:21:52.579
You wait and see.

01:21:52.662 --> 01:21:57.667
Any time tonight,
that ghost ship's gonna turn up.

01:21:58.835 --> 01:22:03.631
And it's gonna take us all with it,
straight down to the hot place.

01:22:24.319 --> 01:22:26.654
Mr Hollom.

01:22:26.738 --> 01:22:29.449
You gave me such a start.

01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:34.078
Are you feeling better now?

01:22:34.162 --> 01:22:37.707
Yes. Much better, thank you.

01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:53.389
The captain thinks
we'll get our wind tomorrow.

01:22:53.473 --> 01:22:55.558
I'm sure of it.

01:23:24.504 --> 01:23:28.049
You've always been very kind to me.

01:23:35.139 --> 01:23:37.559
Goodbye, Blakeney.

01:24:45.835 --> 01:24:50.632
The simple truth is, not all of us become
the men we once hoped we might be.

01:24:50.715 --> 01:24:53.676
But we are all God's creatures.

01:24:56.429 --> 01:25:00.767
If there are those among us
who thought ill of Mr Hollom,

01:25:01.684 --> 01:25:04.395
or spoke ill of him,

01:25:06.105 --> 01:25:09.734
or failed him in respect of fellowship,

01:25:10.985 --> 01:25:14.531
then we ask for your forgiveness, Lord.

01:25:14.614 --> 01:25:16.783
And we ask for his.

01:25:32.549 --> 01:25:35.134
God be praised. Mr Mowett?

01:26:00.493 --> 01:26:02.954
Avast there.

01:26:16.676 --> 01:26:19.804
- Doctor, have you seen the bird?
- What sort of bird?

01:26:19.888 --> 01:26:26.853
Some sort of albatross. Either that, or
he's a prodigious great mew. There it goes.

01:26:33.193 --> 01:26:37.113
There he is. My bird. Damn.

01:26:38.781 --> 01:26:40.742
It's circling, lads.

01:26:47.874 --> 01:26:48.917
Doctor?

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.336
My God. Doctor.

01:26:52.754 --> 01:26:57.592
I'm so sorry, man.
The bird dropped low. I didn't see you.

01:27:00.303 --> 01:27:03.556
- Calamy, get Higgins.
- I'm fine, Jack.

01:27:17.070 --> 01:27:19.864
The bullet took in a piece of shirt with it.

01:27:19.948 --> 01:27:24.994
Unless it's removed,
it's gonna suppurate and fester.

01:27:25.078 --> 01:27:27.038
Are you equal to the task?

01:27:27.121 --> 01:27:33.211
I'll need to read up on the doctor's books.
Study some pictures he has.

01:27:33.294 --> 01:27:35.213
Study some pictures?

01:27:35.296 --> 01:27:38.383
It's just to get my bearings, that's all.

01:27:38.466 --> 01:27:45.098
It'd be a lot easier if I were on dry land.
You wouldn't have the...

01:27:45.181 --> 01:27:47.684
I'll manage. You'll see.

01:28:12.125 --> 01:28:15.837
Sail on the horizon, sir. Running west.

01:28:16.379 --> 01:28:19.257
We're not sure, but we think it's her, sir.

01:28:23.178 --> 01:28:25.180
Better get...

01:28:26.556 --> 01:28:28.641
Goodbye, sir.

01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:50.997
No mistakin' it. She's the Frenchie.

01:28:58.546 --> 01:29:01.716
Shall we beat to quarters, sir?

01:29:40.129 --> 01:29:42.632
Tell me this wasn't on my account.

01:29:42.715 --> 01:29:47.846
No, not at all.
I just needed to stretch my legs.

01:29:49.556 --> 01:29:51.975
Gently there.

01:29:58.731 --> 01:30:02.527
Briskly now. Secure this line.

01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:05.905
Royal Marines posted every 20 yards, sir.

01:30:16.958 --> 01:30:19.544
- All set, Higgins?
- Yes, sir.

01:30:19.627 --> 01:30:22.046
No.

01:30:22.630 --> 01:30:25.633
I do this with my own hand.

01:30:31.097 --> 01:30:34.184
If everything is under control,
I'll just be outside.

01:30:34.267 --> 01:30:37.353
A spare pair of steady hands
wouldn't go amiss.

01:30:37.437 --> 01:30:42.942
That is, if, of course, you have
the constitution for this kind of thing.

01:30:43.318 --> 01:30:51.242
My dear doctor, I have been amongst
and around wounds all my life.

01:30:51.784 --> 01:30:53.953
Good, then.

01:30:54.037 --> 01:30:59.125
Put your hand on my belly,
pressing firmly when I give the word.

01:30:59.209 --> 01:31:02.670
Higgins, the catling, if you please.

01:31:10.136 --> 01:31:12.388
Padeen, please.

01:31:25.652 --> 01:31:28.154
The sounder, Mr Higgins.

01:31:29.531 --> 01:31:31.616
Swab.

01:31:41.668 --> 01:31:43.753
All right.

01:31:46.673 --> 01:31:49.926
Mr Higgins, you'll have to raise the rib.

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:56.975
Take a good grip with the square retractor.

01:32:00.436 --> 01:32:02.647
Right in.

01:32:02.730 --> 01:32:04.691
And lift up.

01:32:04.774 --> 01:32:06.234
Lift up.

01:32:19.330 --> 01:32:21.916
Swab, Jack. I can't see.

01:32:26.296 --> 01:32:29.340
Are you all right?

01:32:39.309 --> 01:32:41.394
I got it.

01:32:53.031 --> 01:32:55.325
A tad more pressure.

01:33:06.169 --> 01:33:08.880
- Is that all of it?
- Aye, sir.

01:33:09.589 --> 01:33:11.799
She'll patch up nicely.

01:33:11.883 --> 01:33:13.801
Thank God I got it.

01:33:59.597 --> 01:34:01.432
That's good.

01:34:09.065 --> 01:34:10.859
Sir.

01:34:10.942 --> 01:34:14.779
- Padeen and I have been collecting for you.
- Have you really?

01:34:14.863 --> 01:34:18.491
The beetles each come with a specimen
of the plant they were found on.

01:34:18.575 --> 01:34:21.035
Padeen, that one's got away.

01:34:21.119 --> 01:34:25.373
Sir, I've made a few notes,
if you want to see them.

01:34:41.389 --> 01:34:45.435
Mr Blakeney, it would appear that
you have the makings of a naturalist.

01:34:45.518 --> 01:34:52.442
Perhaps I could combine them to be
a sort of fighting naturalist, like you, sir.

01:34:54.611 --> 01:34:57.947
They don't combine too well, I find.

01:34:58.031 --> 01:34:59.073
Right.

01:34:59.157 --> 01:35:01.534
Should you really be getting up, sir?

01:35:01.618 --> 01:35:05.079
- Mr Blakeney, are you also a doctor?
- No, sir.

01:35:05.163 --> 01:35:08.583
No, you're not. Padeen, if you please.

01:35:15.048 --> 01:35:19.469
How long does the captain
intend that we stay? Do you know?

01:35:21.346 --> 01:35:23.806
- Oh, a week perhaps.
- A week?

01:35:23.890 --> 01:35:27.936
- There's no great hurry.
- Mustn't we make haste for the Marquesas?

01:35:28.019 --> 01:35:30.939
I'm not even sure
it was the <i>Acheron</i> we sighted.

01:35:31.022 --> 01:35:36.069
And if it was, she'll be well away by now.
Like looking for an honest man in parliament.

01:35:36.152 --> 01:35:41.282
No, we shall head home. Before peace
breaks out with France, God forbid.

01:35:44.911 --> 01:35:48.331
I fear you may have burdened me
with a debt I can never repay.

01:35:48.414 --> 01:35:53.628
Tosh. Name a shrub after me.
Something prickly and hard to eradicate.

01:35:53.711 --> 01:35:58.383
A shrub? Nonsense.
I'll name a great tortoise after you.

01:35:58.466 --> 01:36:01.261
<i>Testudo aubreii.</i>

01:36:42.927 --> 01:36:46.264
Come on, pack up your things.
We should be going.

01:36:46.347 --> 01:36:49.559
- Back to camp, sir?
- No, to the other side of the island.

01:36:49.642 --> 01:36:54.105
- But, sir, that must be at least ten miles.
- Then there's not a moment to lose.

01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:57.192
That's where I saw my flightless cormorant.

01:36:57.275 --> 01:36:59.194
Come on.

01:37:10.121 --> 01:37:13.082
Seven inches in length.

01:37:14.083 --> 01:37:16.127
Four inches wide.

01:37:16.211 --> 01:37:18.713
15-inches-long neck.

01:37:19.797 --> 01:37:24.135
Width at the widest point, six inches.

01:37:30.183 --> 01:37:33.728
Padeen, put the net down
and use your hands. They won't bite.

01:37:33.811 --> 01:37:36.064
Here's a good one.

01:37:37.815 --> 01:37:40.568
Pick them up carefully.

01:37:41.194 --> 01:37:44.072
Sir, I think we should be getting back.

01:37:44.155 --> 01:37:49.661
Naval discipline doesn't operate out here,
Mr Blakeney. I must find that cormorant.

01:37:49.744 --> 01:37:52.413
And should it indeed prove flightless,

01:37:52.497 --> 01:37:56.334
you can join me at the Royal Society dinner
as co-discoverer.

01:39:20.084 --> 01:39:21.628
Mr Blakeney.

01:39:36.768 --> 01:39:39.062
Sir, we must hurry.

01:39:41.272 --> 01:39:46.986
Padeen, you must carry him. Put those down.
Leave them. Just put everything down.

01:39:50.490 --> 01:39:53.243
Open the cages.

01:40:07.674 --> 01:40:12.554
- All hands, unmoor ship.
- Mr Allen, I'll have her on a starboard tack.

01:40:12.637 --> 01:40:15.849
Let's have hands to stow these tortoises.

01:40:15.932 --> 01:40:20.019
Barret Bonden,
put your helm hard to starboard.

01:40:22.105 --> 01:40:25.483
He has a head start of two hours on us
and he's bearing south.

01:40:25.567 --> 01:40:29.279
That can only mean King Charles Island.
He's looking for water.

01:40:29.362 --> 01:40:36.536
If we caught up with her, to take her,
we'd have to be bloody invisible.

01:40:37.745 --> 01:40:40.707
Brace the yards to starboard.

01:40:49.966 --> 01:40:53.094
So, Stephen, did you get to see your bird?

01:40:53.178 --> 01:40:57.182
No. Well, yes, but I couldn't catch one.

01:40:57.891 --> 01:41:00.852
My greatest discovery was your phantom.

01:41:00.935 --> 01:41:05.982
Indeed it was. I'm sorry you had to leave
the majority of your collection behind.

01:41:06.065 --> 01:41:12.071
In actual fact, Mr Blakeney and I
did make one very interesting find.

01:41:12.155 --> 01:41:14.824
Is that right?

01:41:14.908 --> 01:41:17.160
Let me guess. A stick?

01:41:24.292 --> 01:41:26.377
Tell him about it, Mr Blakeney.

01:41:26.461 --> 01:41:29.839
- It's a rare phasmid, sir.
- A phasmid?

01:41:29.923 --> 01:41:36.429
It's an insect that disguises itself as a stick
in order to confuse its predators.

01:42:28.731 --> 01:42:30.984
A nautical phasmid, Doctor.

01:42:31.067 --> 01:42:36.072
At least, to a hungry eye,
if one has an appetite for whalers.

01:42:36.155 --> 01:42:40.493
I intend to take a greater interest
in the bounty of nature from now on.

01:42:40.577 --> 01:42:45.123
I had no idea that a study of nature
could advance the art of naval warfare.

01:42:45.206 --> 01:42:47.208
I see.

01:42:47.292 --> 01:42:50.420
Now to pull this predator in close
and spring our trap.

01:42:50.503 --> 01:42:52.005
- Jack?
- Yes.

01:42:52.088 --> 01:42:54.924
You're the predator.

01:42:56.176 --> 01:43:01.264
There. Hull-down,
broad off the larboard bow.

01:43:01.347 --> 01:43:03.266
That's a frigate, all right.

01:43:03.349 --> 01:43:06.561
Damn, you've got good eyes, Barret.

01:43:06.644 --> 01:43:10.773
- Mr Allen. More smoke.
- Aye, sir.

01:43:10.857 --> 01:43:13.484
That'll bring 'em about.

01:43:24.329 --> 01:43:29.125
That's it, lads. Clean 'em up
so they fly straight and true.

01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:34.756
Let's have fresh flints in all the locks.

01:43:43.890 --> 01:43:48.728
Larboard battery,
unship your rear wheels.

01:43:53.233 --> 01:43:55.318
Drop the gun.

01:43:58.530 --> 01:44:02.158
- Come on, Killick, you too. Get dressed.
- Oh, God.

01:44:02.242 --> 01:44:05.161
- Tom?
- Our preparations are completed, sir.

01:44:05.245 --> 01:44:09.958
Good. Right, from now on
no "sirs", no salutes, no whistles, no bells.

01:44:10.041 --> 01:44:11.709
Aye, sir.

01:44:11.793 --> 01:44:15.421
Yes, I think we're all
finding that quite difficult.

01:44:16.339 --> 01:44:19.342
There'll be 30 or more whalers
locked in the <i>Acheron's</i> hold.

01:44:19.425 --> 01:44:22.804
After we board, Mr Calamy
should take a party and free them.

01:44:22.887 --> 01:44:26.766
- You think him ready, sir?
- Were you ready, Tom?

01:44:26.850 --> 01:44:29.644
- He may well turn the tide.
- Indeed, sir.

01:44:40.238 --> 01:44:42.490
She's taken the bait. Let's come about.

01:44:42.574 --> 01:44:46.619
Make a show of fleeing, panicky
and disorganised, like a whaler might.

01:44:46.703 --> 01:44:49.122
Present company excepted, Mr Hogg.

01:44:49.205 --> 01:44:51.082
Hurry up, or they'll see you.

01:44:51.166 --> 01:44:55.420
Eckhart, leave that. Just come up quick
and get some whaler's slops on.

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:12.562
- Congratulations. Acting third lieutenant.
- Thank you.

01:45:12.645 --> 01:45:17.358
- I hear we're to free the whalers.
- You're to be stationed on the quarterdeck.

01:45:17.442 --> 01:45:19.861
I'm sorry, Will.

01:45:21.821 --> 01:45:27.285
Make a bad show of keeping your course.
Let her run up and luff every now and then.

01:45:28.077 --> 01:45:31.039
- Excuse me, sir.
- Remove your hat. We're whalers.

01:45:31.122 --> 01:45:35.335
Mr Calamy says I'm not
on the boarding party. I want to say...

01:45:35.418 --> 01:45:39.506
I know what you want to say.
And my answer is no.

01:45:39.589 --> 01:45:43.968
You'll lead your gun crew, then when
we board, you'll take command of the ship.

01:45:44.052 --> 01:45:48.431
- Do I make myself clear?
- Take command of the ship? Thank you, sir.

01:45:48.515 --> 01:45:51.059
- Back to your station.
- Yes, sir.

01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:57.440
On your right upper arm,
to tell friend from foe.

01:45:57.524 --> 01:46:00.151
Davies, this arm. Starboard arm.

01:46:00.235 --> 01:46:03.988
- Is that the arm you got or don't got?
- Less of that cheek, Davies.

01:46:04.072 --> 01:46:07.867
Take your neck cloths
and put them round your right upper arm.

01:46:07.951 --> 01:46:10.537
Make way for the captain.

01:46:11.913 --> 01:46:13.998
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

01:46:14.082 --> 01:46:15.625
Right, lads.

01:46:15.708 --> 01:46:18.044
I know there's not a faint heart among you,

01:46:18.127 --> 01:46:21.923
and I know you're as anxious as I am
to get into close action.

01:46:22.006 --> 01:46:25.593
But we must bring him right up beside us
before we spring this trap.

01:46:25.677 --> 01:46:27.679
That will test our nerve.

01:46:27.762 --> 01:46:31.850
And discipline will count
just as much as courage.

01:46:31.933 --> 01:46:37.355
The <i>Acheron</i> is a tough nut to crack.
More than twice our guns and numbers.

01:46:37.438 --> 01:46:40.692
And they will sell their lives dearly.

01:46:42.527 --> 01:46:46.781
Topmen, your handling of the sheets
to be lubberly and un-navylike,

01:46:46.865 --> 01:46:49.534
until the signal
to spill the wind from our sails.

01:46:49.617 --> 01:46:53.037
This will bring us almost to a complete stop.

01:46:53.121 --> 01:46:56.749
Gun crews, you must run out and tie down
in double-quick time.

01:46:56.833 --> 01:47:02.130
With the rear wheels removed you've gained
elevation, but without recoil you can't reload.

01:47:02.213 --> 01:47:07.510
So, gun captains, that gives you one shot
from the larboard battery. One shot only.

01:47:07.594 --> 01:47:12.390
You'll fire for her mainmast.
Much will depend on your accuracy.

01:47:12.473 --> 01:47:20.815
However, even crippled she will still
be dangerous, like a wounded beast.

01:47:21.774 --> 01:47:23.818
Captain Howard and the marines

01:47:23.902 --> 01:47:28.198
will sweep their weather deck with swivel gun
and musket fire from the tops.

01:47:28.281 --> 01:47:31.326
They'll try and even the odds for us
before we board.

01:47:33.119 --> 01:47:36.664
They mean to take us as a prize.

01:47:36.748 --> 01:47:43.463
And we are worth more to them undamaged.
Their greed will be their downfall.

01:47:45.298 --> 01:47:48.134
England is under threat of invasion.

01:47:48.218 --> 01:47:52.388
And though we be on the far side
of the world, this ship is our home.

01:47:54.015 --> 01:47:56.893
This ship is England.

01:48:00.021 --> 01:48:04.567
So it's every hand to his rope or gun.
Quick's the word and sharp's the action.

01:48:04.651 --> 01:48:08.071
After all, surprise is on our side.

01:48:19.541 --> 01:48:22.460
- Toss them high so they can see them.
- Hello, Doctor.

01:48:22.544 --> 01:48:23.920
Jack.

01:48:24.003 --> 01:48:26.256
- Care for a cigar?
- Thank you, no.

01:48:26.339 --> 01:48:28.925
If you please, Doctor.

01:48:30.343 --> 01:48:33.596
- I took the liberty, Doctor.
- Thank you, Killick.

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:38.351
- There's three lumps in there.
- How kind.

01:49:33.114 --> 01:49:35.617
- Good luck, Will.
- Good luck, Peter.

01:49:37.410 --> 01:49:40.955
- See you afterwards.
- And you.

01:49:41.998 --> 01:49:45.627
Steady now, lads. Keep calm.

01:49:48.087 --> 01:49:51.674
English whaler <i>Syren,</i> this is <i>Acheron.</i>

01:49:51.758 --> 01:49:53.426
- Barret.
- Sir.

01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:58.306
You have no possibility, no chance.
But you have had warning.

01:49:58.389 --> 01:50:01.851
Stop now, or we will destroy your ship.

01:50:01.935 --> 01:50:05.355
English whaler, this is your last warning.

01:50:05.438 --> 01:50:09.734
Stop now, or we will destroy you.

01:50:09.817 --> 01:50:12.070
Let fly!

01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:17.825
Haul your yards there.

01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:21.329
Run out, boys.

01:50:21.412 --> 01:50:22.580
Fire!

01:50:23.790 --> 01:50:25.583
Fire!

01:50:34.467 --> 01:50:37.136
For the mainmast, lads.

01:50:44.102 --> 01:50:46.563
- Let me through.
- Fire!

01:51:14.174 --> 01:51:16.259
Hard a-larboard.

01:51:16.968 --> 01:51:19.512
Right the headsails. Set the topsails.

01:51:19.596 --> 01:51:20.889
Heave.

01:51:21.973 --> 01:51:24.851
Man the starboard battery.

01:51:30.982 --> 01:51:33.359
Fire as she bears.

01:51:53.838 --> 01:51:56.799
Get to it.

01:51:56.883 --> 01:51:59.511
It's the fallen mast. We can't lay alongside.

01:51:59.594 --> 01:52:02.639
Cross the wreckage as best you can.
I'll draw their fire.

01:52:02.722 --> 01:52:06.684
- My division to join Mr Pullings.
- Clew up topsails.

01:52:06.768 --> 01:52:09.771
Huzzah for Lucky Jack.

01:52:09.854 --> 01:52:12.482
Grappling hooks away.

01:52:12.565 --> 01:52:14.984
Run out the boarding planks.

01:52:17.111 --> 01:52:22.283
- My division, follow me.
- For England, for home, and for the prize.

01:52:22.909 --> 01:52:25.495
Here we go, lads.

01:52:29.666 --> 01:52:31.751
Pipe down. Silence.

01:52:54.524 --> 01:52:56.526
Looks like the job is done, sir.

01:52:56.609 --> 01:52:58.361
<i>Acheron.</i>

01:53:12.667 --> 01:53:13.877
Fire!

01:53:30.602 --> 01:53:32.979
Mr Blakeney, the nine-pounder.

01:53:33.062 --> 01:53:34.939
That's it.

01:53:35.023 --> 01:53:36.107
Fire!

01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:39.694
Keep moving, men. Keep moving.

01:54:28.827 --> 01:54:30.703
Joe.

01:54:36.584 --> 01:54:38.211
Grenades, ready.

01:54:48.388 --> 01:54:51.349
They're aiming for our hull.

01:54:51.432 --> 01:54:54.102
They could sink us. Depress the muzzle.

01:54:54.185 --> 01:54:56.229
Padeen, train it aft.

01:54:56.312 --> 01:54:57.981
Together now.

01:54:58.898 --> 01:55:01.025
Stand clear.

01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:02.902
Fire!

01:55:03.778 --> 01:55:06.197
Arm yourselves. We must board them.

01:55:07.574 --> 01:55:09.659
Follow me.

01:55:25.091 --> 01:55:26.843
Now.

01:55:31.514 --> 01:55:35.643
Whalers, follow me.
Mr Hogg, down below. Quickly now.

01:55:38.104 --> 01:55:41.900
Albatrosses. Albatrosses, do you hear me?

01:55:42.859 --> 01:55:44.903
To the guns.

01:55:48.489 --> 01:55:50.825
Boyle, douse that gun's priming.

01:56:26.027 --> 01:56:29.030
Lively there. Come on. Move.

01:56:32.575 --> 01:56:35.245
Now do your worst.

01:57:06.609 --> 01:57:08.570
- Mr Howard.
- Sir.

01:57:08.653 --> 01:57:11.281
- Have they struck their colours?
- I believe so.

01:57:11.364 --> 01:57:15.034
- Has their captain been sighted?
- Not yet, sir.

01:57:15.118 --> 01:57:16.995
- Carry on.
- Aye, sir.

01:58:18.973 --> 01:58:21.392
<i>Docteur de Vigny, monsieur.</i>

01:58:21.476 --> 01:58:24.270
I did what I could for him.

01:58:29.359 --> 01:58:33.488
Before the <i>capitaine</i> died,
he said I was to give you this.

02:00:03.495 --> 02:00:06.456
No. I'll do it.

02:00:20.178 --> 02:00:22.597
Can you help me?

02:00:46.454 --> 02:00:48.289
Our Father,

02:00:48.373 --> 02:00:52.418
who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

02:00:52.502 --> 02:00:56.381
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

02:00:56.464 --> 02:00:58.842
on earth as it is in heaven.

02:00:59.509 --> 02:01:02.262
Give us this day our daily bread,

02:01:02.345 --> 02:01:07.267
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:11.437
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

02:01:11.521 --> 02:01:13.481
For thine is the kingdom,

02:01:13.565 --> 02:01:15.608
the power and the glory,

02:01:15.692 --> 02:01:17.777
forever and ever.

02:01:17.861 --> 02:01:19.404
Amen.

02:01:20.029 --> 02:01:23.491
Robert Gardner, able seaman.

02:01:23.575 --> 02:01:27.412
James Lloyd, boatswain's mate.

02:01:27.495 --> 02:01:30.540
Robert Kemp, able seaman.

02:01:31.749 --> 02:01:35.670
John Antonio, quartermaster's mate.

02:01:36.921 --> 02:01:40.884
Michael Doudle, able seaman.

02:01:42.385 --> 02:01:46.055
Joseph Nagle, carpenter's mate.

02:01:47.682 --> 02:01:50.935
John Allen, sailing master.

02:01:56.441 --> 02:01:58.443
Peter Miles Calamy,

02:02:03.156 --> 02:02:05.408
lieutenant.

02:02:07.827 --> 02:02:11.080
We therefore commit
their bodies to the deep,

02:02:11.164 --> 02:02:13.333
to be turned into corruption,

02:02:13.416 --> 02:02:17.253
looking for the resurrection of the body
when the sea shall give up her dead,

02:02:17.337 --> 02:02:20.215
and the life of the world to come,

02:02:20.298 --> 02:02:23.635
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

02:02:23.718 --> 02:02:25.803
Amen.

02:02:54.666 --> 02:02:56.960
It's our old friend.

02:03:51.347 --> 02:03:54.350
Pass down a barrel of paint, please.

02:04:00.857 --> 02:04:05.028
Sir, the whalers are all aboard
and that's the last detachment of marines.

02:04:05.111 --> 02:04:06.738
Good.

02:04:06.821 --> 02:04:09.616
I think I shall return to the Galápagos.

02:04:09.699 --> 02:04:13.453
Take on food and water and give
the doctor a few days to find his bird.

02:04:13.536 --> 02:04:14.746
Very good, sir.

02:04:14.829 --> 02:04:18.291
You, however,
shall take the <i>Acheron</i> south to Valparaíso.

02:04:18.374 --> 02:04:23.588
Parole the prisoners there, refit as necessary,
and we shall rendezvous in Portsmouth.

02:04:23.671 --> 02:04:26.716
I believe Mr Hogg
would be a good choice for sailing master.

02:04:26.799 --> 02:04:31.554
However, that will be your decision,
Captain Pullings.

02:04:36.476 --> 02:04:38.561
Your orders.

02:04:42.357 --> 02:04:45.109
- Thank you, sir.
- Godspeed, Tom.

02:04:45.193 --> 02:04:47.195
And to you, sir.

02:04:52.951 --> 02:04:54.911
- Mr Mowett?
- With pleasure, sir.

02:04:54.994 --> 02:04:57.664
- Good luck.
- See you in Portsmouth.

02:04:57.747 --> 02:05:01.251
Now, lads, huzzah for Captain Pullings.

02:05:08.883 --> 02:05:12.637
- Good luck, sir.
- Good luck, Captain.

02:05:28.653 --> 02:05:30.572
Here we go again.

02:05:30.655 --> 02:05:33.116
Killick. Killick there.

02:05:33.199 --> 02:05:35.994
Which it will be ready when it's ready.

02:05:41.541 --> 02:05:44.460
I'll rest easier when I know
they've reached shore.

02:05:44.544 --> 02:05:49.841
So many wounded, and only that poor
unfortunate Higgins to tend to them.

02:05:49.924 --> 02:05:53.595
Still, he's better than no doctor at all.

02:05:53.678 --> 02:05:58.474
- I met their doctor. I spoke to him.
- No, he died of fever months ago.

02:05:58.558 --> 02:06:01.144
De Vigny?

02:06:12.655 --> 02:06:16.451
- Pass the word for Mr Mowett.
- Mr Mowett to the great cabin.

02:06:16.534 --> 02:06:19.579
Their "doctor" gave me this sword.

02:06:20.538 --> 02:06:21.748
Sir.

02:06:21.831 --> 02:06:24.876
Mr Mowett, change of course.
Southeast by east.

02:06:24.959 --> 02:06:28.463
We'll intercept the <i>Acheron</i>
and escort them into Valparaíso.

02:06:28.546 --> 02:06:31.424
Aye, sir. Sou'east by east.

02:06:32.467 --> 02:06:35.220
- And William.
- Sir?

02:06:35.303 --> 02:06:38.056
- Beat to quarters.
- Very good, sir.

02:06:43.102 --> 02:06:46.564
Subject to the requirements of the service.

02:06:53.988 --> 02:06:57.325
Well, Stephen, the bird's flightless?

02:06:57.408 --> 02:06:58.493
Yes.

02:06:59.577 --> 02:07:02.247
It's not going anywhere.

02:17:25.327 --> 02:17:28.748
