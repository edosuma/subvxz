00:02.036 --> 00:04.138
BRYAN:
Halloween is my absolute
favorite holiday.

00:04.172 --> 00:06.974
I look forward to it all year
and put all of my energy

00:07.007 --> 00:08.976
into making sure it's fun
and festive for everyone.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.179
It's like Gay Christmas,
except you get

00:11.212 --> 00:13.347
to invite people
you actually like.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.152
I don't like this.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.253
Well, I'm sorry,
but last year

00:19.287 --> 00:20.754
you scared too many children
with your costume

00:20.788 --> 00:22.390
when you went
as the mother from Precious.

00:22.423 --> 00:25.193
Okay, so now I have to
be-- who am I again?

00:25.226 --> 00:27.528
Matt Lauer
from The Today Show.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.397
He handles hard-hitting news
and cooking segments
with equal aplomb.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.932
Look, Rocky, the point
of Halloween is that

00:31.965 --> 00:33.867
you get to be whoever
it is you want to be,

00:33.901 --> 00:35.403
and I want you
to be Matt Lauer.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.571
Another Halloween thing
I love to do

00:37.605 --> 00:39.107
is pick out pumpkins
in the paparazzi patch

00:39.140 --> 00:40.841
with my bestie Nicole Richie.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.411
(paparazzi clamoring)
Nicole!

00:45.146 --> 00:47.115
Can you hold this pumpkin
in front of my head

00:47.148 --> 00:48.116
to obscure their shot?

00:48.149 --> 00:49.049
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.852
This must be so
annoying for you.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.222
Turn around, turn around!

00:55.256 --> 00:57.191
Put the pumpkin down!

00:57.225 --> 00:58.592
Nicole!

00:58.626 --> 01:00.027
Is that Courtney Love?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.429
No, that's a scarecrow.

01:01.462 --> 01:04.232
That is Courtney Love.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.299
You look great.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.467
But Halloween
wouldn't be complete

01:06.500 --> 01:08.302
without curling up on the couch

01:08.336 --> 01:11.539
and watching scary movies--
the scarier the better--

01:11.572 --> 01:14.708
Psycho, The Exorcist,
27 Dresses.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.310
I didn't know
Frankenstein had a wife.

01:16.344 --> 01:18.279
Oh, sure, nobody has a problem
with monster marriage.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.148
Ooh, here comes
a scary part.
God, who can see

01:20.181 --> 01:20.981
in here?

01:21.014 --> 01:22.116
Sweet mother.
Oh!

01:22.150 --> 01:23.151
David.
Geez.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.385
Guys, I've been
thinking a lot

01:24.418 --> 01:25.919
about our Halloween costumes,

01:25.953 --> 01:27.488
and, Bryan, I know
you always have

01:27.521 --> 01:29.490
a very specific idea of what
we're gonna dress as,

01:29.523 --> 01:31.159
but seeing as there's more of us
this year,

01:31.192 --> 01:35.163
I was thinking that maybe
we could go as...

01:35.196 --> 01:37.398
* Ba-ba-ba.
...a sports team.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.733
Oh, David,
that is a great idea,

01:39.767 --> 01:42.069
oh, but we are all going to be

01:42.102 --> 01:44.238
the redneck family
from Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.506
Well, as long
as you loved my idea.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.940
I already have my makeup
and wardrobe people

01:46.974 --> 01:47.941
at the show on it.

01:47.975 --> 01:48.976
I'm gonna be Mama June,

01:49.009 --> 01:50.144
Goldie's gonna
be Chickadee,

01:50.178 --> 01:51.145
you're gonna be Sugar Bear,

01:51.179 --> 01:52.980
and guess who's Honey Boo Boo.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.317
A dollar makes me holla,
Honey Boo Boo.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.656
You better redneck-ognize.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.625
Great, okay, let's
try it again.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.026
This time give me
pageant cupcake hands.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.496
Whoo, go, baby.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.663
Now show me
gunslinger.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.465
Whoo!

02:11.499 --> 02:13.201
Reminds me of how Nana
used to make me do

02:13.234 --> 02:14.202
pageants when
I was little.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.102
I bet you won a lot.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.337
I did. You
know, Nana put

02:16.370 --> 02:19.273
the entire $65 into
my college fund.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.041
I'm gonna go rehydrate.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.142
Good work, baby.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.311
(slow knocking at door)

02:25.045 --> 02:26.514
(screams)

02:26.547 --> 02:27.881
(laughs)
Your face--

02:27.915 --> 02:29.717
you looked like you were gonna
get killed or something.

02:29.750 --> 02:30.718
No, Clay,

02:30.751 --> 02:32.320
what are you doing here?

02:32.353 --> 02:33.321
It's Halloween.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.223
It's a family tradition.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.524
But you're making
me and Shania

02:36.557 --> 02:38.292
come back to Ohio
next week.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.228
You served me
custody papers, remember?

02:40.261 --> 02:41.862
I didn't, some lawyer did.

02:41.895 --> 02:45.199
Geez, you always got to make
me out to be the bad guy.

02:46.267 --> 02:46.867
Daddy.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.168
Hey, monkey.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.537
Please come in.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.372
(bump)
Ow.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.741
Yep.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.343
I'll get the ice.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.679
Why are you using a melon
baller to do detail work?

02:58.712 --> 03:00.348
Would you use a hammer
to frost a cake?

03:00.381 --> 03:01.582
Can I just do it my way?

03:01.615 --> 03:04.218
Okay, can I see?

03:04.252 --> 03:05.819
Sure.
Oh, your pumpkin

03:05.853 --> 03:06.887
looks like it had
a stroke.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.155
GOLDIE:
You know, Nicole,

03:08.188 --> 03:10.724
besides Santa, you're the
first celebrity I've ever met.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.326
Aw, that's sweet
of you to say,

03:12.360 --> 03:13.727
but don't call
me a celebrity.

03:13.761 --> 03:14.895
But you are.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.764
I know, it's just
so uncool to say.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.266
Oh, got it.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.934
It's like squeezing dog poop
with big seeds in it.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.169
Come on, Shania,
do it with me.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.904
Don't worry,
he doesn't get a knife.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.072
We only let him scoop.

03:25.105 --> 03:26.206
DAVID:
So, Goldie,

03:26.240 --> 03:27.608
uh, how are you doing

03:27.641 --> 03:29.610
with the little surprise
visit from Clay?

03:29.643 --> 03:32.179
I mean, it is hard to pretend
like everything's okay with him

03:32.212 --> 03:33.781
when I know he stands between me

03:33.814 --> 03:34.748
and our happiness.
(doorbell rings)

03:34.782 --> 03:35.883
But then I see him with Shania,

03:35.916 --> 03:38.952
and I feel so bad
for keeping them apart.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.220
(door opens and closes)

03:40.254 --> 03:42.089
Hey, guys.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.791
Hi.
Hey, Ian,

03:43.824 --> 03:45.693
you remember Nicole
and Goldie and Shania,

03:45.726 --> 03:46.860
and that's Clay.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.228
Clay is Goldie's...

03:48.262 --> 03:51.031
C-Clay.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.065
Hey, buddy,

03:52.099 --> 03:53.233
loving the long locks.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.268
Yeah, and those
sandals are rocking.

03:54.302 --> 03:55.769
Hey, Shania, why
don't you take Avery

03:55.803 --> 03:56.904
upstairs and show him
my collection

03:56.937 --> 03:58.406
of East Asian
slippers?

03:58.439 --> 03:59.707
I think you'd
really like that.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.774
Sure.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.776
Hey, I have a shirt
just like that.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.211
It's a tunic.

04:04.244 --> 04:04.878
Come on.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.314
So, Ian, what's

04:06.347 --> 04:07.981
little Avery going as
for Halloween?

04:08.015 --> 04:10.984
Well, we're still hovering
around a couple of ideas.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.453
(Ian and Avery make
shooting noises)

04:12.486 --> 04:13.454
Son,

04:13.487 --> 04:14.722
I got us these great

04:14.755 --> 04:17.891
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle
costumes for Halloween.

04:17.925 --> 04:21.429
No, I want to go as
Bruce Vilanch or a fairy.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.398
Okay, but turtles
with weapons--

04:24.432 --> 04:27.167
that's pretty awesome, huh?

04:27.200 --> 04:28.569
But they don't have
tights or wings

04:28.602 --> 04:32.005
or write jokes
for the Oscars.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.643
So he's going
as Vilanch?

04:35.676 --> 04:37.177
No, I won't let him.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.178
Why can't he be

04:38.211 --> 04:39.747
Batman or
Superman?

04:39.780 --> 04:42.115
I'd even settle
for Aquaman-- a man.

04:42.149 --> 04:42.950
I just don't want

04:42.983 --> 04:44.352
other kids
making fun of him.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.453
NICOLE:
You know,
I read this article

04:45.486 --> 04:46.387
in the New York Times that said

04:46.420 --> 04:48.456
that cross-gender
experimentation happens

04:48.489 --> 04:49.823
in about five percent of boys

04:49.857 --> 04:51.492
and really can be caused
by anything

04:51.525 --> 04:52.926
from emulating
maternal figures

04:52.960 --> 04:54.695
to the presence of
prenatal hormones.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.364
This came up with an
actress friend of mine

04:56.397 --> 04:58.265
whose daughter only
dresses like a boy.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.334
She's totally gonna
tell me who it is
after you guys leave.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.369
No way.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.504
I would never betray
her confidence.

05:05.238 --> 05:06.273
BRYAN:
Ian, I just think
it would be

05:06.306 --> 05:07.307
really empowering for you

05:07.341 --> 05:08.642
to let Avery make
his own choice.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.011
Wait a second, you're okay
with a five-year-old making

05:11.044 --> 05:13.881
his own costume decision
but not with me making mine?

05:13.914 --> 05:16.016
(laughs)
Honey, that's
because we do

05:16.049 --> 05:19.687
things together,
because we are a team.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.456
No, you tell me what
to wear and I wear it.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.657
But you know what?

05:23.691 --> 05:26.326
This year I am gonna be
whoever I want to be.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.861
BRYAN:
So you're not gonna
dress up as Sugar Bear?

05:27.895 --> 05:29.463
Where am I supposed to find
a shiftless husband

05:29.497 --> 05:30.898
and a poor excuse for a father?

05:30.931 --> 05:31.632
I don't know.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.435
Hey, I could do that.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.709
Mom, can I go pick out
my monster makeup?

05:41.742 --> 05:44.144
Oh, man, Shania,
when I was your age,

05:44.177 --> 05:45.979
me and my friends
used to put on makeup

05:46.013 --> 05:48.382
and dress like we were
in this band Kiss.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.917
Oh, we, we spit blood

05:49.950 --> 05:51.485
and blew fireballs
and stuff.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.486
Oh, one time

05:52.520 --> 05:55.055
this awesome dude Johnny Pacheco

05:55.088 --> 05:58.726
poured gasoline in his
mouth and swallowed it.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.327
(laughing):
We were dying.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.531
He actually did; he pretty much
died right in front of our eyes.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.433
We were just about
your age, Shania.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.401
Go pick out your makeup,
okay, honey?

06:08.301 --> 06:09.269
Off you go.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.438
(sighs)

06:10.471 --> 06:12.406
Why would you tell her
a story like that?

06:12.440 --> 06:13.607
She's gonna have nightmares.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.375
Oh, sure, sorry.
Truce?

06:15.409 --> 06:17.377
Fine, truce.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.079
Oh, your face.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.849
You were like, "Oh,
my God, zombie hand."

06:21.882 --> 06:23.617
(laughs)
(laughs sarcastically)

06:24.652 --> 06:26.454
Hey.

06:26.487 --> 06:29.289
Hey.

06:29.322 --> 06:32.259
Hey, I get you're not psyched
that I just kind of showed up,

06:32.292 --> 06:33.627
but I'm glad I'm here.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.463
But you're not really here
for us, are you?

06:35.496 --> 06:38.365
It's all to look good for some
judge back in Ohio, right?
No.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.901
I mean, I want the court
to see I'm a good dad,

06:40.934 --> 06:42.470
but just 'cause I want
to be with Shania.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.704
She's my kid,
I love her.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.405
You say that,
but you don't know

06:45.439 --> 06:47.240
the first thing
about being a good dad.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.341
Come on, Clay,

06:48.375 --> 06:50.611
you've never even taken her
trick-or-treating before.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.145
I tried, remember,
a few years back,

06:52.179 --> 06:54.448
but you were on my case,
nagging me the whole time.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.049
"She needs her jacket.
Don't let her eat nuts.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.551
Make sure the
safety's on."

06:57.585 --> 06:59.419
I have to do that 'cause you
act like a child all the time.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.755
Because you try to control
everything I do, Goldie.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.824
You don't like the way
I do anything with her.

07:03.857 --> 07:07.795
I just want you
to be a better dad.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.396
How can I be?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.799
You took her away and
you moved to California.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.567
How am I supposed
to be the parent

07:13.601 --> 07:16.870
you want me to be if you
won't let me be with her?

07:25.946 --> 07:28.148
I know you're in there,
honey, come on.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.183
Time to go.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.095
Oh, Sam, you're a genius.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.832
You even gave me
Mama June's neck crust.

07:44.865 --> 07:45.933
Oh, it's brilliant.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.434
Oh, please, honey,

07:47.467 --> 07:49.870
if I can make Bea Arthur
pass as a woman,

07:49.903 --> 07:52.005
I can certainly do
a simple fat roll.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.006
(laughs)

07:53.040 --> 07:56.443
(David grunting)

07:56.476 --> 07:57.511
What do you think?

07:57.545 --> 07:58.646
I'm Tom Brady.

07:58.679 --> 07:59.647
I can't believe
you're cheating

07:59.680 --> 08:00.948
on me with
another costume.

08:00.981 --> 08:01.949
I'm not cheating,

08:01.982 --> 08:03.450
I'm just doing my own thing.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.885
It just bothers you
'cause you can't control it

08:04.918 --> 08:05.919
like every other year.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.523
Hey, kids.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.358
(children scream)

08:11.391 --> 08:12.893
Oh, no, don't run away.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.495
He was the wind
beneath my wings.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.030
Cute.
Is it?

08:17.064 --> 08:19.700
Doesn't it all seem just
like a big gay cliché to you?

08:19.733 --> 08:20.801
Why is that you--

08:20.834 --> 08:22.169
and overweight members
of the media--

08:22.202 --> 08:24.137
think that anything
remotely effeminate or camp

08:24.171 --> 08:25.338
is a stereotype?

08:25.372 --> 08:27.407
You're all trying to keep
the fey gay quarantined

08:27.440 --> 08:28.341
in the center square.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.177
Ain't it the truth,
honey?

08:30.210 --> 08:31.011
Nobody wants

08:31.044 --> 08:32.846
the femme gays anymore.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.815
The media, the straights--

08:34.848 --> 08:37.150
everybody has
such disdain.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.587
Even the trans community
doesn't want us.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.755
If you're the least bit
femme anymore,

08:41.789 --> 08:44.592
they call you an Uncle Tom Ford.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.726
BRYAN:
Just face the
truth, David,

08:45.759 --> 08:47.027
you're embarrassed by me.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.361
I am not embarrassed.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.362
He's embarrassed.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.732
It sounds like he's embarrassed.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.000
Okay, I'm a little embarrassed.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.835
I just don't understand
why Halloween has to be

08:54.868 --> 08:56.670
one big gender-bending party.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.672
David, every day of
the year, I walk around

08:58.706 --> 09:00.440
a little self-conscious
in the world.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.374
I'm not like you.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.076
I have to remember
to deepen my voice

09:03.110 --> 09:04.845
and be aware of my
too-vivid hand gestures

09:04.878 --> 09:07.047
and take big,
manly strides.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.116
Wear Spanx
to the supermarket.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.383
BRYAN:
But on Halloween

09:10.417 --> 09:11.451
I get to let
all that go.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.253
I get to put on my
mask and my makeup

09:13.286 --> 09:14.454
and let my
freak flag fly,

09:14.487 --> 09:16.189
so that's what I'm
trying to do this year.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.424
You can join me or not.

09:17.457 --> 09:18.626
Okay, I choose not.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.559
Fine.
Fine.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.594
Sam, what are you going as?

09:20.628 --> 09:23.964
Lisa Ling's sister--
the one who got kidnapped.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.298
Lucy Liu got kidnapped?

09:25.332 --> 09:26.734
No.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.569
The cool thing
about this year is,

09:29.603 --> 09:32.606
in this costume, babe,
people won't get uptight

09:32.640 --> 09:34.141
if I'm drinking a beer

09:34.174 --> 09:35.142
while we're out
trick-or-treating.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.309
Yeah.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.712
I look like I did
in our wedding photos.

09:38.746 --> 09:39.713
You've never
been prettier

09:39.747 --> 09:41.381
than on that day, Goldie.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.750
Stop it.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.085
But the most awesome
thing about all this

09:45.118 --> 09:46.586
is that we're going
as a family--

09:46.620 --> 09:47.721
you, me,
and the kid.

09:47.755 --> 09:48.756
SHANIA:
Mom.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.159
I don't want to be
Honey Boo Boo.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.961
It's just not me.
What?

09:53.994 --> 09:55.395
Baby, you look
adorable,

09:55.428 --> 09:56.797
and I thought
you loved the idea.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.666
Well, Bryan's bossiness
is infectious,

09:58.699 --> 10:00.233
and I laugh at the show, too,

10:00.267 --> 10:01.902
but I feel
like I'm laughing at them.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.236
Plus, I can't support
something

10:03.270 --> 10:05.806
that perpetuates
a sexualization of girls

10:05.839 --> 10:07.140
and denigrates
a family

10:07.174 --> 10:09.176
because of their lack
of economic resources.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.110
Know what I mean?

10:10.143 --> 10:11.244
GOLDIE:
Baby,

10:11.278 --> 10:12.680
you don't ever have to be

10:12.713 --> 10:13.981
someone you don't want to be.

10:14.014 --> 10:14.948
Go on, go
wash off

10:14.982 --> 10:16.449
the eight pounds of makeup.

10:17.851 --> 10:18.986
(sighs)
You see, Goldie,

10:19.019 --> 10:20.353
you did it again.

10:20.387 --> 10:23.490
I'm her dad, and you
didn't even ask me.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.325
You just made the
decision yourself.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.528
Me and Shania were supposed
to be costume buddies.

10:28.561 --> 10:29.496
Every time I
figure out a way

10:29.529 --> 10:30.964
to get close to her,

10:30.998 --> 10:33.266
you always steal
her away from me.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.135
That is not true.
No.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.469
No more, Goldie.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.271
We-We'll ditch the
stupid costumes, okay,

10:38.305 --> 10:39.539
but I'm gonna have
a great Halloween

10:39.572 --> 10:42.710
with my kid, and I'm
gonna do it my way.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.480
I don't want to dress up
as Honey Boo Boo. I just feel

10:47.514 --> 10:49.817
like Halloween is a chance
to show the world who you are,

10:49.850 --> 10:51.551
and I'd rather not squander it
on a message

10:51.584 --> 10:54.187
that champions irony
over authenticity.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.023
I had a different idea
about what

10:56.056 --> 10:57.224
to go as instead.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.059
You are wasting
your breath, Shania.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.460
No one changes
Bryan's mind

11:00.493 --> 11:01.862
about anything.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.698
He won't even participate
in daylight savings time.

11:04.732 --> 11:05.498
It's just so arbitrary.

11:05.532 --> 11:06.533
DAVID:
See?

11:06.566 --> 11:07.835
Good luck with your costume.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.136
Tell me what
you were thinking, sweetie.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.137
I thought it'd be neat

11:10.170 --> 11:11.171
if I went as Frankenstein.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.472
Frankenstein?

11:12.505 --> 11:13.974
That's so last century.
Hmm.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.509
I even had this idea that
we could all go as Frankenstein.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.245
Cause in a way, we're sort of
these separate pieces

11:18.278 --> 11:19.512
who've been sewn together

11:19.546 --> 11:23.751
to make up this kind of
freaky family.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.586
Well, I do have a closet
full of platform boots.

11:26.619 --> 11:27.654
Okay, guys, we
have to hurry.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.556
We only have 24 hours
to get our costumes ready.

11:29.589 --> 11:33.360
Or 23 hours if you believe one
of them magically disappears.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.165
This is great.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.700
Oh, these bolts are cool.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.736
Brains!

11:42.770 --> 11:46.339
Uh, Mom, Frankensteins
don't scream, "Brains."

11:46.373 --> 11:48.575
That's zombies.
Oh. Sorry.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.077
Brains!

11:50.110 --> 11:51.378
(roaring)
(giggling)

11:51.411 --> 11:52.545
DAVID:
All right, go long.
Go long, Bry.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.081
Bry, go long.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.282
Hey, look, everybody.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.784
It's Igor in a jockstrap.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.118
Sorry, everyone.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.120
Dr. Frankenstein's
a little testy

12:00.153 --> 12:03.256
because someone is doing
what they want to for once.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.925
No, David. I think
a football player

12:04.958 --> 12:06.193
is a really
original costume.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.761
Right behind hobo
and slutty nurse.

12:07.795 --> 12:11.298
This... getting... awkward.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.466
(doorbell rings)
Oh, good!

12:13.500 --> 12:15.468
The first
trick-or-treaters!

12:15.502 --> 12:17.704
(moaning)
(moaning)

12:17.737 --> 12:18.939
Come on.
Brains!

12:18.972 --> 12:20.140
(roaring)

12:20.173 --> 12:21.241
(grunting)

12:21.274 --> 12:22.876
(grunting)
Are you ready?

12:22.910 --> 12:24.577
Yup.
(roars)

12:24.611 --> 12:26.646
Oh.
BRYAN:
Rocky.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.581
Matt Lauer would never wear
that tennis dress.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.383
I'm Serena Williams.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.820
I'm tired of you telling me who
I have to be every Halloween.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.922
Why is everybody rejecting
my brilliant ideas?

12:34.955 --> 12:37.424
No wonder mad scientists
are so mad.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.092
Rocky, guess
who I am.
Oh, my God.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.728
You're the little guy
on top of a football trophy.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.830
Do you want to come
trick-or-treating with us?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.731
No, thanks. I'll stay here

12:44.764 --> 12:47.134
and hand out candy to
the adorable children

12:47.167 --> 12:48.902
and protect the liquor cabinet
from vandals.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.804
(knocking)
Oh, good!

12:50.838 --> 12:52.772
The first trick-or-treaters!

12:52.806 --> 12:53.740
Boo.
(cheers and laughs)

12:53.773 --> 12:55.775
(groaning)

12:59.179 --> 13:01.514
Boo!

13:05.218 --> 13:07.287
Nana, what are you doing here?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.189
After everything you did
with Shania's pretend wedding,

13:09.222 --> 13:10.357
you can't expect me

13:10.390 --> 13:11.992
to welcome you with open arms.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.593
JANE:
Oh.
It was me.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.594
I called her.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.329
I have not missed
a Halloween

13:16.363 --> 13:17.931
with Goggles
for nine years,

13:17.965 --> 13:20.500
and I'm not about
to start now.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.701
Oh, really? Well,
who are you supposed to be?

13:21.734 --> 13:23.636
She's Endora
from Bewitched.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.605
She was the show's
sharp-tongued comic relief.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.441
Audiences didn't know
whether to love her or hate her.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.709
JANE:
Come on.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.278
There's a lot
of candy out there,

13:31.311 --> 13:34.014
and a neighborhood full of fat,
Persian kids to beat to it.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.715
Let's go.

13:35.748 --> 13:36.783
Candy!

13:36.816 --> 13:37.985
Okay.
BRYAN:
Come on, Rocky.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.652
Turn the lights off,

13:39.686 --> 13:41.621
we'll put the candy
by the door. Come with us.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.891
Even though I didn't wear
your Matt Lauer costume?

13:43.924 --> 13:45.959
Look, sometimes
I lose sight of the big picture.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.327
But you know what?

13:47.360 --> 13:49.362
Your costume makes me
look better by association.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.464
(laughs)
It's like Jay-Z
with Beyonce.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.533
What do you say?

13:53.566 --> 13:55.535
Trick-or-treat!

13:55.568 --> 13:56.703
Fruit?

13:56.736 --> 13:58.205
What is this, an off-ramp?

13:58.238 --> 14:00.507
Come on.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.809
What do you say?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.444
Thank you.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.480
Hmm.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.149
(door squeaks shut)

14:09.182 --> 14:13.086
Hey, Halloween isn't only
about the treats, you know.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.855
It's also about the tricks.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.857
(whispers):
All right, let's go.

14:17.891 --> 14:18.758
(doorbell rings)

14:18.791 --> 14:19.993
ALL:
Trick-or-treat!

14:20.027 --> 14:21.995
Hey, guys.
Come on in!

14:22.029 --> 14:23.330
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.532
Now that

14:25.565 --> 14:27.267
is a costume.
Hey, how you doing?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.169
Hi.
You got anything
stronger than candy?

14:29.202 --> 14:31.338
Yup, up, we got plenty.
Come on in.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.739
Hey. Where's your daughter
and her dad?

14:32.772 --> 14:34.774
Um, I think trick-or-treating
one street over.

14:34.807 --> 14:37.277
Clay said this is
the only night for free candy.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.112
That he can have free
boring conversation

14:39.146 --> 14:41.714
any other night
of the year, so, meh.

14:41.748 --> 14:42.782
(sighs)

14:42.815 --> 14:44.551
So, Ian,

14:44.584 --> 14:45.385
I don't think
you've met...

14:45.418 --> 14:46.753
Endora from
Bewitched!

14:46.786 --> 14:48.355
I love that show!

14:48.388 --> 14:51.291
Look! I'm a fairy!
I can fly! Wee!

14:51.324 --> 14:52.725
No more candy, son.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.794
Son? Are you going

14:54.827 --> 14:57.764
to let that little fairy
out-do you like that?

14:57.797 --> 15:00.900
So, I-I thought you guys were
going as Ninja Turtles?

15:00.934 --> 15:03.403
We were. Then Avery threw a fit.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.805
Do you know what it's like to
be around someone who screams

15:05.838 --> 15:08.108
and cries and holds his breath
until he gets what he wants?

15:08.141 --> 15:09.442
Nope.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.811
After two hours of high-pitched
screeching, I realized,

15:11.844 --> 15:14.714
I can force him to dress
a certain way for me,

15:14.747 --> 15:17.050
but it's not gonna change
who he is on the inside.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.451
He is who he is.

15:18.485 --> 15:19.719
Not gonna
change him.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.254
You're a good dad, bud.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.723
No. I'm weak,
and I'm exhausted.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.425
All I care about
is that cold beer

15:25.458 --> 15:28.261
that my wife brings me
after she's tucked him in.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.929
But that's nice of you to say.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.731
Daddy, help.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.833
I have poo-poo
in my panties.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.839
Atomic Fireball? Score!

15:39.872 --> 15:42.642
I love Atomic Fireballs.
Yeah.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.944
Sure do love their
daddies, don't they?

15:44.978 --> 15:48.148
Oh, still hate me, huh?

15:48.181 --> 15:50.750
We have plenty of time
to work that out in Ohio.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.253
Back where people
clean their own houses.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.256
God, Nana, sometimes you make me
so crazy, you know that?

15:56.289 --> 15:57.857
The things you say.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.159
I am what I am.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.927
Not about to change now.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.463
And I guess I need
to remember that.

16:05.232 --> 16:07.100
When I saw you
trick-or-treating tonight,

16:07.134 --> 16:11.338
the way you were with Shania--
it made me think.

16:11.371 --> 16:14.541
You're the one person
who's always been there for me.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.412
The only one,
actually. Ever.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.184
Goldie, what do you say
to the nice lady?

16:24.217 --> 16:26.486
Trick-or-treat!

16:26.519 --> 16:28.121
Thank you.
Good girl.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.957
You remembered to say thank you.
I'm surprised.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.793
I'd like to think
that I'm a good mom.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.064
But I didn't learn that
from my mom.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.232
I learned it from you.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.203
Thank you, Nana.

16:43.236 --> 16:47.040
Thank you for always
being here for us.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.077
Didn't really have a choice.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.978
I couldn't just leave you.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.846
Sure you could have.
No.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.048
But you didn't.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.584
And even now
that I'm all grown up,

16:57.617 --> 17:00.820
here in L.A. with people and
choices you don't understand,

17:00.853 --> 17:03.823
still...

17:03.856 --> 17:05.858
you still haven't left.

17:07.927 --> 17:11.831
You know, I...

17:11.864 --> 17:13.933
I think I get mad at you

17:13.966 --> 17:16.369
'cause I can.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.740
'Cause you're here.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.580
Would you just look
at all the money

17:27.614 --> 17:30.016
these homos spend
on decorations?

17:30.049 --> 17:33.052
It's like they're
being paid per sin.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.588
I love you, Nana.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.992
Appreciate you saying that.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.133
Shania, tonight
was awesome.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.568
We're gonna do this all the
time when you're back in Ohio.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.070
But you know trick-or-treating
is just one night a year, right?

17:51.104 --> 17:53.940
The rest of the time, there's
lots of important stuff to do.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.642
Like what?

17:55.675 --> 17:58.811
Pay bills, make breakfast
and pack nut-free lunches.

17:58.845 --> 17:59.879
Do homework with me,

17:59.912 --> 18:02.382
cuddle me in every night,
just like Mom does.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.950
Can you do all that?

18:03.983 --> 18:05.952
'Course. I'm your dad.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.053
I love you.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.788
I know you do.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.757
I mean, you're fighting Mom
for custody.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.260
That means a lot to me,
but the thing is,

18:13.293 --> 18:14.894
you've never really been a dad.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.096
You've always been more
like a friend.

18:17.130 --> 18:20.066
Yeah. A best friend.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.969
But sometimes
I need more than a friend.

18:23.002 --> 18:25.638
I need a dad.
A dad, dad.

18:27.106 --> 18:31.978
I want be a good dad...
but I don't know how.

18:32.011 --> 18:35.982
I mean, I was only 15
when I met you, Shania.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.921
I cannot believe

18:41.954 --> 18:43.956
this is our last Halloween
before we have a kid.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.359
After this, it's all going
to be about him or her.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.162
Still a little
bit about me.
It's amazing
how kids change you.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.331
I mean, back in med school,
every year

18:51.364 --> 18:54.167
Ian's costume was
the same-- tired Jew.

18:54.201 --> 18:57.537
(muffled laugh)
This year,
he was a fairy.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.105
Well, if this
is our last year

18:59.138 --> 19:00.673
picking our own
Halloween costumes,

19:00.707 --> 19:03.210
seems like it'd be a shame
to let Tom Brady go to waste.

19:03.243 --> 19:06.045
You know, Tom Brady
is a quarterback,

19:06.078 --> 19:09.015
and you can get a flag
for roughing the passer.

19:09.048 --> 19:10.983
I have no idea what
you're talking about,

19:11.017 --> 19:13.886
but I like the way
you're saying it.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.888
(knocking)

19:15.922 --> 19:18.024
What happened?

19:18.057 --> 19:19.326
An earthquake.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.793
You can't always feel 'em.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.196
When you get a sec,
can you come downstairs?

19:24.264 --> 19:26.065
What's going on?

19:26.098 --> 19:27.567
I'm not good
at a lot of things.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.136
No kidding.
And even though
I want to be,

19:30.169 --> 19:33.005
I know I haven't been
a real good dad to Shania.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.641
You know, if-if being

19:34.674 --> 19:37.510
a better dad means doing
what's right for your kid, then,

19:37.544 --> 19:39.212
the right thing
for Shania

19:39.246 --> 19:40.847
is to be here in L.A.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.048
with her ma.

19:42.081 --> 19:44.083
So I'm dropping
the custody case.

19:44.116 --> 19:46.052
Holy hell!

19:46.085 --> 19:47.220
I love you, Shania.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.822
And I want to be a better dad.

19:49.856 --> 19:53.025
You just did
what a dad-dad would do.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.627
Thank you.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.533
CLAY:
And since I'm in
California, guess what?

20:00.567 --> 20:02.001
I'm an actor now!

20:02.034 --> 20:03.836
(whoops)

20:03.870 --> 20:05.171
I think he's
actually too smart.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.007
Could somebody please
give me a Valium?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.676
Why don't you come with
me to West Hollywood?

20:09.709 --> 20:12.345
If they think we're drag
queens, we drink for free.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.681
Oh. Well.

20:14.714 --> 20:18.184
I think I would rather be drunk
with those freaks

20:18.217 --> 20:20.186
than sober with these.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.654
Hmm.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.457
Bye, Thelma.
Bye, Louise.

20:24.491 --> 20:26.092
Come on, everybody,
grab a seat.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.226
Spooky movie time!

20:30.129 --> 20:32.299
Dad, would you mind
sitting next to me?

20:32.332 --> 20:33.065
This movie's

20:33.099 --> 20:34.601
pretty scary.

20:34.634 --> 20:37.069
Oh. Uh, yeah.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.575
Since when are you
afraid of scary movies?

20:42.609 --> 20:44.911
Oh, I'm not,
but my dad gets bad dreams.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.557
(knocking)

20:57.590 --> 21:00.059
Hi. Hey, we just
wanted to thank you

21:00.092 --> 21:02.795
for being the house that
passes out fruit on Halloween.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.096
Yes. It's what
every eight-year-old

21:04.130 --> 21:05.765
trick-or-treater is hoping for.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.500
Their full daily allowance
of vitamin C.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.902
Yeah, I was just disappointed
it wasn't baby carrots.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.103
Or throat lozenges.

21:11.137 --> 21:12.372
Or flu shots.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.675
I think we made our point.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.076
Let's go find that house

21:17.109 --> 21:18.277
where they're passing
out the pencil erasers.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.779
Go deep, Bry! Go deep!
