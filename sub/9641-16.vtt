WEBVTT

00:05.309 --> 00:07.610
And this is
the hallway.

00:07.645 --> 00:10.079
A long corridor
that students can use

00:10.114 --> 00:12.348
to mosey from
class to class.

00:12.383 --> 00:15.685
I know what
a hallway is, Laritate.

00:15.719 --> 00:18.087
Right. Sorry.

00:18.122 --> 00:19.589
Superintendent Clanton,

00:19.623 --> 00:21.524
it's just that
I'm a little nervous.

00:21.559 --> 00:25.361
Your surprise school inspection
caught me totally off-guard.

00:25.396 --> 00:28.431
Yes, that's
the surprise part.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.769
You'll be fine as long as you've
been running a shipshapehip.

00:39.577 --> 00:42.679
Oh, hey! I just joined the
school's one-man marching band.

00:42.746 --> 00:45.849
We don't have a
one-man marching band, Max.

00:45.883 --> 00:48.885
I can see why,
'cause I sound terrible.

00:48.919 --> 00:50.220
See you guys later.

00:57.094 --> 01:00.129
Unsafe use of
musical instruments.

01:00.164 --> 01:03.199
I can explain that.

01:03.234 --> 01:04.566
Actually, I can't.

01:04.602 --> 01:09.472
Quick, Justin.
Say something amazing.

01:09.506 --> 01:11.307
An object in motion
tends to stay in motion

01:11.342 --> 01:14.477
unless acted upon by an
external, unbalanced, force.

01:14.511 --> 01:16.212
Good enough.

01:16.247 --> 01:19.816
Let's get you out of here while
that's still fresh in your mind.

01:21.285 --> 01:23.753
Out of my way, people.
Coming through!

01:23.787 --> 01:26.456
Alex, what is going on?

01:26.490 --> 01:29.459
Don't you remember?
It's Roller Skates and Pie Day.

01:29.493 --> 01:31.194
I've been planning this
for months.

01:32.730 --> 01:35.265
Roller Skates
and Pie Day?

01:35.299 --> 01:38.768
What kind of a rusty freighter
are you running, Captain?

01:40.170 --> 01:43.172
Don't worry. I'll pull in the
reins on this cattle drive.

01:43.207 --> 01:45.074
- Alex, come back here.
- Nope!

01:45.109 --> 01:46.542
This is not
a good time for this.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074
Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

01:55.719 --> 01:57.220
Look...

02:00.424 --> 02:02.091
...what you did!

02:03.327 --> 02:06.696
You know, the fact that
I don't know who you are

02:06.730 --> 02:09.264
makes this even
more satisfying.

02:11.335 --> 02:14.170
And interestingly enough,
that was a perfect example

02:14.204 --> 02:16.406
of the law
I was just describing.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.975
The object in motion...
Stay with now, her...

02:19.009 --> 02:22.111
Not now with
the nerd stuff, Justin.

02:22.146 --> 02:26.749
Laritate, you have obviously
lost control of the helm.

02:26.784 --> 02:31.821
And it seems that
this young sailor here

02:31.855 --> 02:36.326
may be the iceberg
that sinks your Titanic.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.996
Oh, that's very sweet
of you to say. Thank you.

02:41.265 --> 02:43.599
Laritate, as you know,
it is the job of the principal

02:43.634 --> 02:45.268
to control his students

02:45.302 --> 02:48.237
and sink their spirit
whenever possible.

02:50.741 --> 02:52.141
If you're not up to the task,

02:52.176 --> 02:56.245
I have no choice but to
relieve you of your command.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.749
- What a you saying?
- I'm saying...

02:59.783 --> 03:02.652
...stand down
from the bridge.

03:05.289 --> 03:07.590
Are you saying I should
get out of the saddle?

03:07.624 --> 03:09.225
That's horsefeathers!

03:09.259 --> 03:11.861
I'm sorry. I don't know
what that means.

03:11.895 --> 03:15.031
Oh, for gosh sakes,
he just fired you,

03:15.065 --> 03:16.933
and he's upset
about it.

03:19.636 --> 03:23.673
You're making a very huge
mistake, Superintendent Clanton.

03:31.615 --> 03:34.951
Would it make you feel better
if I gave you a goodbye pie?

03:34.985 --> 03:37.820
I'm in no mood,
Miss Russo.

03:39.556 --> 03:41.524
It's lemon meringue.

03:43.560 --> 03:44.794
Thank you.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000

04:38.615 --> 04:41.617
Keep moving, deckhands.
Get to class.

04:43.954 --> 04:46.455
Iceberg alert.

04:47.724 --> 04:50.493
Hello,
Superintendent Clanton.

04:50.527 --> 04:53.496
You know, I was thinking
of funny things I could do

04:53.530 --> 04:56.832
that'd drive you crazy.
But then I thought,

04:56.867 --> 05:00.436
"Alex, why not give
the poor guy a break?"

05:00.470 --> 05:02.638
So I baked you
this cake instead.

05:16.887 --> 05:20.256
Ah! The ol'
fish-in-the-cake bit.

05:22.392 --> 05:26.162
Yum. I like to eat
the middle first, too.

05:26.196 --> 05:28.497
I'm on to you, Russo.

05:28.532 --> 05:31.767
I used to be a gym teacher.
Do you know what that means?

05:31.802 --> 05:34.604
It means I was
kicked out of the Navy.

05:34.638 --> 05:36.672
That's right.

05:36.707 --> 05:39.809
Four and a half weeks
of basic training,

05:39.843 --> 05:44.113
so you don't
scare me one bit.

05:49.786 --> 05:53.889
Ahoy there,
Superintendent Clanton.

05:53.924 --> 05:56.192
Hello, barnacle.

05:56.226 --> 05:58.628
I would just like to welcome
you, sir, to our school

05:58.662 --> 06:00.830
with a basket full
of fruits and bath oils,

06:00.864 --> 06:06.168
courtesy of the Student Body
President and future valedictorian.

06:08.605 --> 06:10.206
No, thank you.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.908
I have no respect for students
who use their good grades

06:12.943 --> 06:17.246
and stellar behavior
to curry favor with authority.

06:17.281 --> 06:20.316
Hey, what are you guys
talking about?

06:21.885 --> 06:26.322
My word. What is
that on your head?

06:26.356 --> 06:29.292
That would be his
mashed potato helmet.

06:29.326 --> 06:31.827
Correction, Alex, it was
my mashed potato helmet.

06:31.862 --> 06:35.498
At some point during my walk to
school it became my bug helmet.

06:35.532 --> 06:38.167
Need I remind
you students

06:38.201 --> 06:41.103
things are different now
that Laritate is gone.

06:41.138 --> 06:44.340
Behavior like yours
will no longer be tolerated.

06:44.374 --> 06:48.811
And to prove
that I mean business,

06:48.845 --> 06:53.983
I'm amplifying my voice
with this bullhorn.

06:55.485 --> 06:57.687
Now drop
and give me 20.

07:00.324 --> 07:03.159
All of you.

07:03.193 --> 07:05.861
All right, look.
I'll give you 20 bucks,

07:05.896 --> 07:08.698
'cause the whole workout
thing isn't really my scene.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.400
Just do the push-ups, sailor.

07:12.269 --> 07:13.536
If you have to,

07:13.570 --> 07:16.906
you can do the girly version
like your brother.

07:19.276 --> 07:22.645
It allows me to do
more reps for tone.

07:22.679 --> 07:25.147
We need to get
Mr. Laritate back.

07:25.182 --> 07:27.016
He likes my fish cake.

07:27.050 --> 07:29.985
Once, he threw away the
cake and ate the fish.

07:30.020 --> 07:33.089
Keep going, mashed potato-head.

07:37.454 --> 07:40.757
- Hey, how was school?
- Horrible.

07:40.791 --> 07:43.159
Look at how our new principal's
making everybody dress.

07:43.193 --> 07:44.927
I mean, how are we
supposed to tell

07:44.962 --> 07:46.529
the weirdos from the losers?

07:48.132 --> 07:50.767
I think I could
make that work, don't you?

07:50.801 --> 07:52.201
No. It's hideous.

07:52.236 --> 07:54.303
Okay, but I'm asking if
it's acceptable for me

07:54.338 --> 07:56.105
to wear young people's clothes.

07:59.376 --> 08:02.211
Ah, greetings and
salutations darling mother.

08:02.246 --> 08:03.279
Honorable father.

08:05.416 --> 08:08.551
Would any of you care
for a nutritious snack?

08:08.585 --> 08:11.587
Max? Are you feeling okay?

08:11.622 --> 08:12.789
Never better, actually.

08:12.823 --> 08:14.924
Our new principal's
strict rules and dress codes

08:14.958 --> 08:17.093
have taken the guesswork
out of my life.

08:17.127 --> 08:18.728
I feel so much
more focused now.

08:23.767 --> 08:26.302
Can we please agree to leave
the pillows as we found them?

08:26.336 --> 08:28.404
Thank you very much.

08:30.140 --> 08:34.342
Jerry. There's something
seriously wrong with our son.

08:34.378 --> 08:36.412
Isn't it great?

08:38.115 --> 08:39.615
No, it's not great.

08:39.650 --> 08:42.018
Look what I found
in his backpack.

08:43.419 --> 08:45.988
Jerry, those are
college brochures.

08:46.023 --> 08:48.291
I know.
I can't pay for that.

08:49.626 --> 08:52.695
You cannot just leave here
wearing a mashed potato helmet

08:52.729 --> 08:55.898
and come sauntering back in
wanting to go to college.

09:04.041 --> 09:07.477
Alex, I heard at the hobby shop
that Mr. Laritate took a new job

09:07.511 --> 09:08.845
at some place called,

09:08.879 --> 09:11.881
Wild Bill's Western Round-Up
and Tent Rental.

09:11.915 --> 09:14.484
That's great. We've got to get
down there and convince him

09:14.518 --> 09:16.285
to come back to school.
Come on, Max.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.620
I don't think so, Alex.

09:17.654 --> 09:19.622
With my new appreciation
of law and order,

09:19.656 --> 09:22.792
I'd much rather stay home and
conform to the rules of society.

09:22.826 --> 09:23.860
Okay.

09:28.599 --> 09:31.033
Mr. Laritate, we really need
to talk to you right now.

09:31.068 --> 09:33.636
Howdy, buckaroos.

09:33.670 --> 09:37.573
Can I interest you in a ride
on one of my prized broncos?

09:37.608 --> 09:39.876
No, this is important.
See, the thing is...

09:39.910 --> 09:42.411
Seriously, I can't talk to you
unless you're riding the horses

09:42.446 --> 09:43.513
or renting the tent.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.952
Whoa, whoa! I was gonna
get on that short one.

09:49.987 --> 09:51.687
- Go.
- You know I'm afraid of heights!

09:53.290 --> 09:57.293
Westward ho!

09:57.327 --> 09:59.795
All right, what did you
need to talk to me about?

09:59.830 --> 10:02.265
You need to come back
to Tribeca Prep.

10:02.299 --> 10:05.101
Superintendent Clanton's the
worst. He's not afraid of Alex,

10:05.135 --> 10:08.838
he doesn't find me charming,
he's making Max make sense,

10:08.872 --> 10:11.807
which is...
It's all backwards!

10:11.842 --> 10:14.177
I'd like to help you kids,
but, unfortunately,

10:14.211 --> 10:17.413
I'm finally living the life
I was meant to live.

10:17.447 --> 10:22.952
As a part-time employee of
Wild Bill's Western Round-Up?

10:22.986 --> 10:25.488
Yes. Take a look around.

10:27.691 --> 10:29.458
The life of the cowboy.

10:29.493 --> 10:33.629
Where men can be men and
the stallions can roam free

10:33.664 --> 10:36.199
along the wide open plain.

10:36.233 --> 10:41.170
Who am I kidding? This is
nothing like the Old West.

10:42.940 --> 10:46.042
Just a tent in a parking lot.

10:46.076 --> 10:50.346
Unfortunately, I was born
at the wrong time in history.

10:50.380 --> 10:55.184
Working here at Wild Bill's is as close
as I'll ever get to living my dream.

10:55.219 --> 10:58.454
Woo-hoo! This is fun.

10:58.488 --> 11:00.022
I'm gonna
call you Scout.

11:00.057 --> 11:02.024
Yeah...

11:02.059 --> 11:04.594
There's just no place for me
in this modern world

11:04.628 --> 11:07.530
with its creamy-licious
coffee drinks

11:07.564 --> 11:10.433
and its crazy doo-wop music.

11:11.969 --> 11:17.340
I'd like to help you kids,
but I'm sorry, I can't.

11:17.374 --> 11:19.208
* Who's the best
pony in the world? *

11:19.243 --> 11:21.277
* Scout is, Scout is... *

11:21.311 --> 11:23.446
- * Scout, yes you are. *
- Justin!

11:27.851 --> 11:29.352
I think I made
a new friend.

11:30.754 --> 11:33.923
Right... Okay!

11:33.957 --> 11:36.125
If we can figure out a way
to prove to Mr. Laritate

11:36.159 --> 11:38.794
that his life wouldn't
be better if he were a cowboy,

11:38.829 --> 11:40.596
then that's what we need to do.

11:40.631 --> 11:43.466
- Wait a minute. I have an idea.
- Okay.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.034
I'm gonna go
to the Sub Station.

11:45.068 --> 11:47.637
You get Mr. Laritate to come
there when his shift is done.

11:50.507 --> 11:55.811
So, where are those musky
aftershaves you promised me?

11:55.846 --> 11:58.247
I'll get them in just
a second, Mr. Laritate.

11:58.282 --> 11:59.615
Wait right here.

12:02.586 --> 12:04.086
Okay, he's here.
What's the plan?

12:04.121 --> 12:06.222
Watch.

12:06.256 --> 12:07.757
Say good night
out like a light

12:12.829 --> 12:15.031
I hope you have more
to your plan than this.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.201
Old West, right away
Yippie-yi-ki-yay

12:27.344 --> 12:29.578
You brought us back
to the Old West!

12:29.613 --> 12:33.015
Yes, so that Mr. Laritate can
see that living in the Old West

12:34.518 --> 12:36.819
Then he'll let go of this
crazy dream once and for all,

12:36.853 --> 12:38.587
and want to be our
principal again.

12:38.622 --> 12:42.358
Alex.
What did you do?

12:42.392 --> 12:46.095
Yeah, I was just hiding Max's
textbooks when, all of a sudden,

12:46.129 --> 12:48.130
I'm in this
ridiculous outfit.

12:48.165 --> 12:51.267
Although I do like
this corset.

12:51.301 --> 12:53.569
Yeah, why didn't
I get one of those?

12:53.603 --> 12:57.673
Don't worry. We're doing something that'll
teach our principal a valuable lesson.

12:57.708 --> 13:00.042
You mean the guy passed out
on the floor over there?

13:01.345 --> 13:05.281
Yes, and when he comes to,
everybody just act westerny.

13:05.315 --> 13:07.717
I don't know how
to act westerny.

13:07.751 --> 13:10.619
Just say "Howdy, pardner"
and "I reckon" a lot.

13:10.654 --> 13:12.455
I call the word,
"varmint."

13:17.761 --> 13:19.495
Oh, what happened?

13:21.965 --> 13:25.735
- What's going on?
- You're having a dream.

13:28.372 --> 13:32.575
Oh, my gosh, I am.

13:34.578 --> 13:38.114
I'm dreaming about
being in the Old West.

13:38.148 --> 13:42.051
And, look, I'm the sheriff.

13:43.653 --> 13:45.654
Yes, well...

13:45.689 --> 13:47.490
Now that you're here,
pardner,

13:47.524 --> 13:49.158
you can see
that the Old West

13:49.192 --> 13:52.395
is a terrible place
to live, pardner.

13:52.429 --> 13:56.132
There's no vending machines,
no air conditioning,

13:56.166 --> 14:00.836
and no microwavable
popcorn... pardner.

14:03.039 --> 14:07.076
And, look, there's only
two things on the menu.

14:07.110 --> 14:09.545
I reckon you want to
get out of here right now,

14:09.579 --> 14:12.648
- I reckon.
- Pardner.

14:14.284 --> 14:16.318
Are you kidding?

14:16.353 --> 14:19.455
Coyote cutlets
and possum-tail soup.

14:19.489 --> 14:23.793
I'll have one of each.
Range and Strange!

14:25.562 --> 14:28.130
Great! He's loving all this.
Now what are we gonna do?

14:28.165 --> 14:29.832
Don't worry.

14:29.866 --> 14:34.136
I'll create an evil villain that'll
scare the Old West out of him.

14:34.171 --> 14:37.706
Bad, bad Leroy Brown,
run Laritate out of town.

14:51.221 --> 14:51.253
Hey, why did everybody get
so quiet all of a sudden?

14:58.595 --> 15:03.599
My listenin' holes tell me

15:03.633 --> 15:07.837
there's a
new sheriff in town.

15:07.871 --> 15:10.372
Superintendent Clanton?

15:10.407 --> 15:12.575
I don't know what
fancy words yer hurlin',

15:12.609 --> 15:15.811
but the name's
Old Man Clanton.

15:15.846 --> 15:19.248
Has been since
I was 12 years old.

15:19.282 --> 15:20.316
Know why?

15:21.952 --> 15:24.920
'Cause I took down
my old man.

15:28.592 --> 15:31.760
Now, you best skedaddle,
law man.

15:31.795 --> 15:34.330
Or I reckon you might be
answerin' to this here

15:34.364 --> 15:38.400
gang of outlaws,
hooligans

15:38.435 --> 15:41.203
and assorted yahoos.

15:42.072 --> 15:44.139
Oh, my gosh.

15:44.174 --> 15:47.276
He knows more cowboy words
than I do.

15:48.545 --> 15:50.813
You were right. There's
no way Laritate's gonna

15:50.847 --> 15:52.348
want to stay here
with these guys.

16:07.731 --> 16:07.763
What's the matter?
Ya yellow-bellied?

16:13.537 --> 16:16.038
No.

16:16.072 --> 16:18.974
Are you yellow-bellied?

16:19.009 --> 16:20.042
No.

16:22.946 --> 16:24.113
Are you?

16:25.582 --> 16:28.484
Oh, well, this could
take forever.

16:28.518 --> 16:30.886
Mr. Laritate?

16:30.921 --> 16:32.788
What's that, Sheriff?

16:32.822 --> 16:36.392
You think that vest makes
Old Man Clanton look like a

16:36.426 --> 16:39.361
dumb... cactus... buzzard?

16:39.396 --> 16:41.664
What? I didn't say...

16:41.698 --> 16:44.700
Listen here, law man.

16:44.734 --> 16:49.538
Nobody,
and I mean nobody

16:49.573 --> 16:53.842
calls me a dumb cactus...
Buzzard?

16:57.180 --> 17:01.717
Buzzard and
gets away with it.

17:01.751 --> 17:03.118
Get him, boys!

17:29.946 --> 17:31.380
Oh, thank you.

17:39.322 --> 17:42.257
Oh, my goodness.
Total lawlessness.

17:45.462 --> 17:46.495
Excuse me.

17:49.466 --> 17:52.001
Total lawlessness!

18:35.278 --> 18:39.882
Oh, my gosh!
Mr. Laritate won.

18:39.916 --> 18:42.418
I... I can't believe it.
Is it over?

18:46.823 --> 18:48.157
Yep, it's over.

18:49.993 --> 18:53.062
Hot smoke and sassafras!

18:53.096 --> 18:58.934
Looks like those dudes
picked on the wrong cow.

19:00.136 --> 19:03.572
I realize I just
called myself a cow,

19:03.606 --> 19:06.075
but I'm in too good
of a mood to care.

19:06.109 --> 19:07.910
It looks like my plan
to get Laritate

19:07.944 --> 19:10.145
to hate the Old West
didn't work.

19:12.148 --> 19:14.983
You were right, Mr. Laritate.

19:15.018 --> 19:17.186
You were meant to
be a cowboy after all.

19:17.220 --> 19:20.489
You bet your
Mexican blankets I was.

19:21.825 --> 19:25.027
He's never gonna come back
to Tribeca Prep with us now.

19:25.061 --> 19:28.097
Come on, let's go.

19:29.466 --> 19:33.502
Wait. I don't want
to stay here.

19:33.536 --> 19:35.604
You don't?

19:35.638 --> 19:38.373
I horsewhipped the outlaws
of the Old West.

19:38.408 --> 19:40.509
I got my gumption back.

19:40.543 --> 19:44.680
Now I need to take care of
the outlaws of the modern day.

19:44.714 --> 19:49.885
Just as soon as I wake up
from this glorious dream.

19:56.626 --> 19:59.962
Modern day, right away
Yippie-yi-ki-yay

20:09.072 --> 20:10.639
Now, you listen,
Clanton.

20:10.673 --> 20:12.608
I've got something to say.

20:12.642 --> 20:14.109
I'm the principal
of this school,

20:14.144 --> 20:17.479
and I aim to stake my claim
and take my job back.

20:17.514 --> 20:19.782
You can't just barge in here

20:19.816 --> 20:23.585
and bully your way back
into your job, Laritate.

20:23.620 --> 20:25.687
This isn't the Old West.

20:26.589 --> 20:29.458
Or is it? Posse!

20:33.797 --> 20:37.266
Cute. Now go change,
you're out of uniform.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.935
No. These are
our uniforms.

20:39.969 --> 20:45.741
Oh... Disobeying orders.

20:45.775 --> 20:47.843
You all have detention.

20:47.877 --> 20:50.512
Well, you're gonna have to put
the entire school in detention,

20:50.547 --> 20:53.115
because everybody in school's
wearing western wear.

20:53.149 --> 20:55.818
No, don't look.
Just take my word for it.

20:55.852 --> 20:57.686
Yeah, take her
word for it,

20:57.720 --> 20:59.822
because we're
all behind Laritate.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.324
You...

21:02.358 --> 21:04.493
You're turning
everyone against me.

21:04.527 --> 21:06.528
Just like Chief Petty Officer
Gunther did

21:06.563 --> 21:08.397
back in basic training
in the Navy.

21:08.431 --> 21:12.334
Who cares if I wouldn't share
the cupcakes in my foot locker!

21:14.537 --> 21:17.773
Mommy sent them to me!

21:17.807 --> 21:19.741
Are we having cupcakes?

21:22.212 --> 21:23.879
Vamoose, Clanton.

21:24.514 --> 21:25.614
That's right.

21:25.648 --> 21:29.451
You can catch the 3:10
to Cupcakeville.

21:29.485 --> 21:30.719
Pardner!

21:32.088 --> 21:34.356
You're all meanies.

21:34.390 --> 21:36.258
You can have this job.

21:36.292 --> 21:37.726
Abandon ship!

21:40.597 --> 21:42.464
You know what
your problem is, Clanton?

21:42.498 --> 21:45.267
When things get tough,
you give up.

21:45.301 --> 21:48.737
I could never do that
to these kids.

21:48.771 --> 21:51.807
When the going gets rough,

21:51.841 --> 21:56.645
this cowboy sticks around
and goes down with the ship.

21:58.014 --> 22:01.850
And, occasionally,
we don't go down.

22:03.019 --> 22:05.420
Not today.

22:05.455 --> 22:07.289
I found his cupcakes.
