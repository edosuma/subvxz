00:28.496 --> 00:30.562
¶ ¶

01:03.064 --> 01:04.396
(click, quiet whirring)

01:05.666 --> 01:06.765
(screams)

01:34.595 --> 01:37.529
17 kids running around,
hopped-up on cake and ice cream.

01:37.531 --> 01:40.132
It was like an invasion
of hyperactive squirrels.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.400
(chuckles)
So what'd you go with,

01:41.402 --> 01:43.268
the beauty parlor
or the pony theme this year?

01:43.270 --> 01:46.405
Disney. I'm gonna be having
fairy tale nightmares for days.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.273
Disney? What the hell
did you dress as?

01:48.275 --> 01:49.575
Yeah, right. What do you think?

01:49.577 --> 01:51.643
I think that
Daddy Sam will do

01:51.645 --> 01:53.812
anything for
his little girl.

01:53.814 --> 01:57.382
I have seen you throw
a mean princess tea party.

01:59.186 --> 02:00.786
Captain Hook.

02:00.788 --> 02:01.854
He's a sailor.

02:01.856 --> 02:03.188
Don't you have something to do?

02:03.190 --> 02:05.290
I'm doing something.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.693
I'm honing my deductive
reasoning skills.

02:07.695 --> 02:10.162
Wasting your time, and
you're interfering with mine.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.264
What was the name of the bad guy
from<i> The Lion King?</i>

02:12.266 --> 02:14.133
I don't know what
you're talking about.

02:14.135 --> 02:15.334
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

02:15.335 --> 02:16.534
It was practically on
a loop at your house.

02:16.537 --> 02:17.536
Scar.
Yes.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.570
What are we
talking about?

02:18.572 --> 02:19.905
Nothing.
Which Disney character

02:19.907 --> 02:21.740
Sam dressed up as for
his, uh, daughter's party.

02:21.742 --> 02:22.741
Aw.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.343
DEEKS:
Baloo

02:24.345 --> 02:25.744
from<i> The Jungle Book.</i>

02:25.746 --> 02:27.312
That's strong.
Beast from
<i>The Beauty and the Beast.</i>

02:27.314 --> 02:28.480
Large,

02:28.482 --> 02:29.915
fearless, a heart of gold.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.316
SAM:
Oh, look at this,

02:31.318 --> 02:33.485
Lady and the Tramp
are helping out Goofy.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.654
Did you see what he just did?
That's my partner.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.223
Sam Hanna,
ladies and gentlemen!

02:38.225 --> 02:39.424
(whistles)
Deflecting!

02:39.426 --> 02:41.326
Time to meet the band, ladies.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.761
What?

02:42.763 --> 02:44.496
I'm just trying out
some new catchphrases.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.397
Yeah, well, try harder.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.665
Grumpy?

02:50.371 --> 02:52.371
What do we have, Nell?

02:52.373 --> 02:54.373
A residential security
camera in Mid-City

02:54.375 --> 02:57.242
caught this guy creeping around
a private residence.

02:57.244 --> 02:59.545
Here he is
entering the property.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.513
And this is him
shortly after.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.416
That's a hell
of a security system.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.251
LAPD's on the scene now.

03:06.253 --> 03:07.819
Do they know
what happened?

03:07.821 --> 03:09.221
Neighbors reported hearing

03:09.222 --> 03:10.622
an explosion
before the police arrived.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.591
Have they identified the body?
ERIC: Jack Chapman.

03:12.593 --> 03:13.859
He worked paparazzi
for that

03:13.861 --> 03:15.627
gossip show<i> Sunset Scoop.</i>

03:15.629 --> 03:17.696
Chapman caused
a huge scandal

03:17.698 --> 03:20.966
by releasing photos of NBA star
Kip Brigham after he was caught

03:20.968 --> 03:22.968
leaving an illegal
gambling establishment.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.536
ERIC:
Chapman filed a lawsuit

03:24.538 --> 03:27.339
accusing Brigham of assault
and property damage

03:27.341 --> 03:29.208
for smashing his camera.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.876
Then Brigham fired back

03:30.877 --> 03:32.543
with a countersuit claiming
that Chapman attacked him.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.547
But there was no witness, so
it's classic he-said, he-said.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.982
KENSI:
I heard about this.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.984
Brigham lost potential millions
on his latest contract

03:38.986 --> 03:40.419
because of bad press.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.221
Could be a case
of revenge.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.523
<i> Sunset Scoop,</i> NBA...

03:44.525 --> 03:46.525
Why NCIS?

03:46.527 --> 03:48.527
It's because of
who owns the home.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.529
The house belongs

03:50.531 --> 03:53.232
to CIA officer Nicole Borders.

03:53.234 --> 03:54.399
<i> The</i> Nicole Borders?

03:54.401 --> 03:55.884
Indeed.

03:55.885 --> 03:57.368
The CIA Director
of Operations

03:57.371 --> 04:00.572
is a friend of Assistant
Director Granger.

04:00.574 --> 04:04.409
He personally requested
our assistance in this matter.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.460
DEEKS:
Borders.

04:05.461 --> 04:06.510
What do we need
to know about her?

04:06.513 --> 04:07.729
SAM:
She's a legend.

04:07.730 --> 04:08.946
The rumor is that
she was instrumental

04:08.949 --> 04:10.282
in orchestrating
successful ops

04:10.284 --> 04:12.351
from taking bin Laden

04:12.353 --> 04:13.819
to ISIS air strikes.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.488
SAM:
Makes her a prime target.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.623
Where is she now?

04:17.625 --> 04:19.358
We're trying
to locate her.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.993
What is
a celebrity photographer doing

04:20.995 --> 04:22.761
at the home of a CIA officer?

04:22.763 --> 04:24.296
HETTY:
That's what you need

04:24.298 --> 04:25.764
to get to the bottom of.

04:25.766 --> 04:26.765
Quickly.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.035
Before it happens again.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.004
KENSI:
So maybe Chapman

04:32.006 --> 04:34.773
found out about the air strikes
and was trying to break a story.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.642
DEEKS: Not really the material
that<i> Sunset Scoop</i> looks for.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.844
SAM: I want to know
what caused that blast.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.679
Yeah, we can't
rule anything out.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.347
Why don't you
two check out

04:42.349 --> 04:44.016
Kip Brigham, find out
if he's got an axe to grind

04:44.018 --> 04:45.484
with this whole
gambling thing.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.985
Uh, full disclosure,
actually, I'm...

04:46.987 --> 04:48.420
Hey, we got it.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.523
Looks like
someone's a fan.
Yikes.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.025
We'll check out
the crime scene.

04:53.027 --> 04:55.694
You two keep digging on Chapman,
see what else you can find.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.496
Copy that.
Copy that.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.364
CALLEN:
Dr. Evil?

04:59.366 --> 05:00.966
Lex Luthor?

05:00.968 --> 05:02.534
SAM: Lex Luthor.
Give it up, G.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.536
You're never gonna guess.
All right?

05:04.538 --> 05:06.405
I know.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.973
Yul Brenner.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.909
You're really not gonna tell me?

05:10.911 --> 05:12.511
It's between me
and my daughter.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.546
I'll just check it out
on Instagram.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.482
Good luck.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.417
Tell me you took the phone
from every kid at that party.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.484
I didn't say that.
Uh-huh.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.455
I know what you did.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.490
You had Beale
scrub the Internet.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.025
All you need to know
is a father's willing

05:27.027 --> 05:28.677
to do anything
for his daughter.

05:28.678 --> 05:30.328
Mm-hmm. Let's see. I mean,
you wouldn't look good

05:30.331 --> 05:32.198
as any of the
Disney princesses.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.066
You could be the genie from
<i> Aladdin.</i> There's no way

05:34.068 --> 05:36.435
you found a pair of lederhosen
that would fit you.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.836
I mean, not
with those legs.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.504
My legs look good in anything.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.040
But why would I be
wearing lederhosen?

05:42.042 --> 05:44.509
<i> Pinocchio</i> was
her favorite bedtime story.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.844
Keep it up.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.646
Make your nose grow.

06:15.376 --> 06:18.377
Chapman wasn't carrying flowers
in the video.

06:18.379 --> 06:19.678
Could've been here previously.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.614
No rose bushes.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.551
(camera clicks)

06:26.553 --> 06:28.420
(phone chimes)

06:28.422 --> 06:30.822
I got a text from Eric.
Officer Borders

06:30.824 --> 06:32.858
is gonna meet us
at the boatshed.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.926
Good.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.997
High velocity blast.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.867
Shoddy craftsmanship.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.503
It's unstable at best.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.571
Activated by a pressure plate.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.607
Whoever built this is lucky
they didn't kill themselves.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.108
You mean like an IED?

06:50.110 --> 06:52.444
Exactly like an IED.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.691
(doorbell rings,
music playing inside)

07:06.693 --> 07:09.094
DEEKS: I mean, clearly
somebody's home.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.196
(sighs)
Yeah.

07:11.198 --> 07:14.065
Must've had to score a lot
of touchdowns for those two.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.934
Did you just say
"touchdowns"?
Yeah.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.804
'Cause he's a basketball player.
He led the league in scoring.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.939
Basketball, huh?
Wow.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.841
We watched him together,
in case you don't remember.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.509
If you say so.
(clears throat)

07:24.511 --> 07:26.645
Just do me a favor,
don't embarrass me.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.079
Oh, hi.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.948
Hi.<i> Hi. </i>
We're federal agents.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.150
We're here to speak to Mister...
BRIGHAM: Marty!

07:32.152 --> 07:33.084
Where you been, dude?
I've been calling you for weeks.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.085
Get in here, man.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.487
DEEKS:
Forgot to mention

07:35.489 --> 07:37.856
that we go, uh, way back.

07:37.858 --> 07:38.790
(chuckles)

07:38.792 --> 07:39.825
What's up, buddy?

07:39.827 --> 07:40.826
What's up, man?
How are you?

07:40.828 --> 07:42.994
I'm good.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.996
Good to see you.
How do you guys
know each other?

07:44.998 --> 07:47.566
Marty-mar is the reason
I got into basketball.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.118
Well, the growth
spurt helped.

07:49.119 --> 07:50.669
But, yeah, we used to
play a lot of one-on-one,

07:50.671 --> 07:52.471
which I consistently
won, I may add.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.505
Yeah. You were
taller then.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.173
Still had the beard though.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.742
Can you put a shirt on?
Sorry.

07:57.744 --> 08:00.479
Do you remember when I said
he was pointing at us

08:00.481 --> 08:02.614
during the game?
And you thought he
wanted to hook up.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.815
Yeah.

08:03.817 --> 08:04.583
With you.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.051
Oh. Nice.

08:06.053 --> 08:09.054
Um, so we're actually here
to ask you some questions.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.122
You weren't playing
about this one. She's bad.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.624
Are you kidding me
right now?

08:12.626 --> 08:13.258
Uh...

08:13.260 --> 08:14.659
DEEKS:
Dude.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.128
We have some questions
about Mr. Jack Chapman,

08:17.130 --> 08:18.997
the, uh,<i> Sunset </i>
<i> Scoop</i> reporter.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.633
Specifically the assault charge
he filed against you.

08:21.635 --> 08:22.734
Easy. He attacked me.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.736
After I tomahawked his camera,

08:24.738 --> 08:26.838
he got all crazy,
tried to rush me.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.507
So I caught him
with a two-piece. Wa, wa!

08:28.509 --> 08:30.909
Dude folded like a lawn chair.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.278
You must've been very upset.
Upset?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.946
Man, that dude cost me
a lot of money

08:34.948 --> 08:36.915
when it came
to renegotiating my contract,

08:36.917 --> 08:38.750
playing paparazzi.

08:38.752 --> 08:42.087
But who knew it would get me
official bad boy status?

08:42.089 --> 08:44.756
New shoe deal doubled
what I would have made before.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.057
I should thank him.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.893
Well, you might have
to hold a séance.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.227
Mr. Chapman was killed today.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.264
Wow.

08:52.266 --> 08:53.532
How?

08:53.534 --> 08:56.201
Still trying to figure that out.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.003
Wait.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.605
You-you think
I had something to do with it?

09:00.607 --> 09:02.607
Got to tweet this.
Where's my phone?
You can't tweet this.

09:02.609 --> 09:03.742
This is an ongoing
investigation.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.076
You can't
tweet anything.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.878
You really think
I murdered someone?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.547
I got my white Bronco out back.

09:08.549 --> 09:09.981
Just relax.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.583
It's protocol. We just need
to know your whereabouts

09:11.585 --> 09:13.285
your last 24 hours.
Unbelievable.

09:13.287 --> 09:16.321
Isn't this some sort
of conflict of interest?

09:16.323 --> 09:17.856
I mean, maybe
I should just be...

09:17.858 --> 09:20.592
talking to her. Alone.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.627
Alone?
Maybe he should talk
to me alone.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.262
It's a conflict of interest.
Okay. (clears throat)

09:24.264 --> 09:25.597
This is supposed
to be you

09:25.599 --> 09:27.165
and I against...
Yeah, that was before

09:27.167 --> 09:28.767
you accused
your best friend of murder.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.569
I don't know if I would
define you as my best friend,

09:30.571 --> 09:31.636
because I got Monty.

09:31.638 --> 09:34.773
(chuckles)
All good.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.274
We just got back
from a press conference

09:36.276 --> 09:37.809
in New York.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.344
Been gone a month.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.012
Flew private.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.714
All the records are here.

09:42.716 --> 09:45.016
And I just e-mailed you
all the details.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.118
Thank you,
Now...

09:47.120 --> 09:49.888
I'm getting back
to the pool.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.690
You want to join?
No. No, no.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.692
'Cause I got better
things to do than

09:53.694 --> 09:56.294
hang out with, like,
half-naked, oiled-up,

09:56.296 --> 09:58.930
supernova-hot models
all day long.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.098
Uh-huh.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.700
(whispering):
I bet you do.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.337
Did you just...
She just saw that.

10:05.339 --> 10:06.738
She's bad.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.740
We got to go.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.342
Kensi.
Yeah.

10:10.344 --> 10:11.810
Come on. Let's go.
Okay.

10:11.812 --> 10:12.944
Come on!

10:12.946 --> 10:14.079
I'm going.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.380
Hey, have fun swimming.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.218
Squinting's bad for your eyes.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.621
Myth. It actually
enhances your focus.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.773
Hmm. What you got?

10:24.774 --> 10:26.924
Well, Callen found these rose
petals at the crime scene.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.159
And that's odd

10:28.161 --> 10:29.361
because...?

10:29.363 --> 10:31.363
Well, there's no rose bush
on the property.

10:31.365 --> 10:33.615
Could've been
there previously.

10:33.616 --> 10:35.866
Maybe. But no wrapping,
no stems, just the petals?

10:35.869 --> 10:37.402
When you put
it like that,

10:37.404 --> 10:39.337
something does smell
a little rotten.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.338
Huh.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.073
(gasps softly)

10:42.075 --> 10:43.274
Perfume.

10:43.276 --> 10:46.711
Beale, you really are
a genius.

10:50.384 --> 10:52.083
CALLEN:
<i> We think it may have</i>

10:52.085 --> 10:53.084
been retaliation.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.352
For?

10:54.354 --> 10:56.688
Your résumé suggests
you made a few enemies.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.124
Must mean I'm
doing my job.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.860
But I don't
know this man,

11:01.862 --> 11:03.695
or what he was doing
at my house.

11:03.697 --> 11:04.929
I haven't been
there in weeks.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.364
It's getting ready
to go on the market.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.433
Where have you been staying?

11:08.435 --> 11:11.202
Across town.
I live with my fiancé

11:11.204 --> 11:13.772
Gunnery Sergeant Mike Johnson
and his son.

11:14.408 --> 11:16.741
Do they go to the house?

11:16.743 --> 11:18.143
Not really.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.878
Mike checks on it
about once a week.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.246
We've had some trouble
with squatters.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.649
SAM: Where's
your fiancé now?

11:23.650 --> 11:26.051
He's been training in the Mojave
for about a month.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.986
He's supposed to
be home tonight.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.121
Any chance he knows Chapman?

11:31.458 --> 11:33.291
Maybe.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.694
I don't know. Why?
SAM: Because Chapman

11:35.696 --> 11:37.762
must have been there looking
for someone or something.

11:37.764 --> 11:40.098
If he knew my fiancé, he
knows he doesn't live there.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.516
Unless he asked him

11:41.517 --> 11:42.933
to look after the house
while he was gone.

11:42.936 --> 11:46.104
So if the bomb
wasn't meant for Chapman...

11:46.106 --> 11:48.940
It was intended for your fiancé.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.477
Or you.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.419
They filled me in.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.854
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.491
They told me what happened.

12:06.493 --> 12:09.427
I grew up with Chapman.
He said he was in the area

12:09.429 --> 12:12.397
and it wouldn't be a problem
to check on the house.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.999
He was doing me a favor;
this is on me.

12:15.001 --> 12:17.035
This isn't your fault, Mike.

12:17.037 --> 12:19.771
There's no way you could have
foreseen this happening.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.906
Where's Devin?

12:21.908 --> 12:24.776
Agent Callen and Agent Hanna are
picking your son up right now.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.415
Sorry, is that a problem?

12:30.417 --> 12:31.983
No, this will be good for Devin.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.752
My son can be a bit by-the-book.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.820
Meaning?

12:35.822 --> 12:38.857
I hope your agents know
how to exercise patience.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.392
(chuckles)

12:41.394 --> 12:44.462
SAM: This is like the military
school Aiden goes to.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.999
CALLEN: No cliques,
girls falling for bad boys,

12:48.001 --> 12:49.768
no geeks.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.320
I don't get it.

12:51.321 --> 12:52.871
It's a military academy,
not a social club.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.939
I also went to a school
just like this.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.775
That explains a lot.

12:56.777 --> 13:00.011
Give them a boy at eight,
they return a man at 18.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.447
I think I took
a total of 18 classes.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.015
And that explains a lot.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.784
Well played.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.118
Excuse me.
Sir?

13:07.120 --> 13:09.187
I'm looking for
Cadet Johnson.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.389
Yes, sir.
Across the quad, sir.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.991
Thanks.
Thanks.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.962
Devin Johnson?

13:17.964 --> 13:21.266
We're with NCIS.

13:21.268 --> 13:24.002
We're here to take you
to your father.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.538
At ease, Cadet.

13:26.540 --> 13:28.840
Sir, Gunnery
Sergeant Johnson says

13:28.842 --> 13:31.509
I'm not to leave the grounds
without proper authorization.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.344
Look, son...
Sir, no disrespect,

13:33.346 --> 13:35.246
but I am not your son.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.216
I'm Cadet Master Devin Johnson,
and I do not break exit protocol

13:38.218 --> 13:40.051
without proper authorization
from Gunnery Sergeant Johnson.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.221
You mean your dad?

13:43.223 --> 13:44.823
I prefer to utilize
the rank structure.

13:44.825 --> 13:45.890
Uh-huh.

13:46.827 --> 13:49.194
Cadet. Chief Petty
Officer Hanna.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.995
Sir, yes, sir!

13:50.997 --> 13:54.032
Outstanding demonstration
of following protocol.

13:54.034 --> 13:57.068
What do you need to
solve the problem?

13:57.070 --> 13:58.436
Sir,

13:58.438 --> 14:00.538
if I could communicate
with Gunnery Sergeant Johnson

14:00.540 --> 14:02.240
for permission
to adjust protocol.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.942
Mm-hmm.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.614
(line ringing)

14:09.616 --> 14:12.250
CALLEN:
Kens, uh, can you put

14:12.252 --> 14:14.519
Gunnery Sergeant Johnson
on the phone?

14:14.521 --> 14:17.121
Cadet Johnson won't leave
without his dad's permission.

14:17.123 --> 14:19.157
KENSI:
Uh, sure.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.893
Sir?

14:21.895 --> 14:23.328
Yes, sir.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.530
Like he's talking
to a senior officer.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.249
Affirmative.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.967
Some people actually take
the chain of command seriously.

14:28.969 --> 14:29.968
DEVIN:
Copy that.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.136
Confirming
protocol adjustment.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.439
We good?

14:34.441 --> 14:37.075
Permission granted to adjust.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.643
So we can go?

14:38.645 --> 14:39.944
Yes, sir.

14:39.946 --> 14:41.012
This way, gentlemen.

14:42.949 --> 14:44.949
We're gonna be working
for that kid one day.

14:44.951 --> 14:47.085
Yeah. Maybe next week.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.667
Cadet.
Sir.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.602
Ma'am.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.338
It's our new
challenge coin.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.941
Thank you.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.542
What a wonderful gift.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.647
Not the warmest
reception.

15:15.649 --> 15:17.682
Doesn't mean
he doesn't care.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.184
Let's check in with Nell.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.520
Where do we
stand, Nell?

15:22.522 --> 15:24.389
Hey. So those
rose petals you found

15:24.391 --> 15:27.058
reminded me of a case
I consulted on at Pendleton.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.960
There was a perfume bottle left

15:28.962 --> 15:30.962
at the scene of a crime
but no prints.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.231
That got me thinking-- someone
had to have left it there

15:33.233 --> 15:34.365
on purpose, right?

15:34.367 --> 15:37.235
Well, nothing ever came of it.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.237
But I did some digging.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.973
And I found two additional
murders in the last year

15:41.975 --> 15:44.976
with unexplained items
found at the crime scene.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.644
We have a ring,

15:46.646 --> 15:48.947
a necklace
and a bottle of perfume.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.983
All men.
All Marines.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.419
A ring, perfume and a necklace.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.489
They're gifts,
but not for the victim.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.992
They're things
you'd give to a...

16:00.994 --> 16:02.327
a girlfriend or a...

16:03.463 --> 16:05.363
...a mother.

16:05.365 --> 16:08.232
SAM: A gift someone sends
who's seeking approval?

16:08.234 --> 16:10.134
Love or validation, maybe?

16:10.136 --> 16:12.003
Take Cadet Johnson.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.304
He's obsessively
disciplined.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.173
You know,
he's a little soldier

16:15.175 --> 16:17.709
trained to do
whatever he's told.

16:17.711 --> 16:21.579
But what would happen
if his dad pushed him too far?

16:21.581 --> 16:23.448
He could snap.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.017
The killer could be

16:26.019 --> 16:27.452
one of these over-disciplined
kids who crumbled

16:27.454 --> 16:29.187
under the pressure. Nell,

16:29.189 --> 16:32.223
see if any of the victims had
sons in the military program.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.491
All right.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.695
Bingo.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.732
All the victims' sons
attend military academies.

16:40.734 --> 16:43.101
The killer may think
he's representing these boys.

16:43.103 --> 16:46.170
He's protecting them
from these overbearing fathers.

16:46.172 --> 16:50.108
We could be dealing
with a serial killer.

17:02.322 --> 17:05.256
In each of the other murders,
there were a series of accidents

17:05.258 --> 17:06.557
leading up
to the victims' deaths.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.692
Let me see that.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.427
Individually,
it doesn't look like much,

17:09.429 --> 17:11.329
but collectively,
there's definitely a pattern.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.097
These locations mean
anything to the victims?

17:13.099 --> 17:14.632
Eric spoke to the spouses.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.068
Every accident was
a point of interest

17:17.070 --> 17:18.569
in each victim's weekly routine.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.505
So he's stalking them.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.306
The risk grew
with every murder attempt.

17:22.308 --> 17:23.708
Means he's driven,
obsessively so.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.310
And he's not gonna stop
until he achieves his goals.

17:26.312 --> 17:29.180
Do we think the killer tried
for Johnson before this?

17:29.182 --> 17:31.549
Well, if he did, we could
use it to our advantage.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.585
If we put the word out there
that Chapman was the one killed.

17:34.587 --> 17:37.522
If he finds out
he didn't get the job done,

17:37.524 --> 17:40.091
could cause the killer
to expose himself.

17:40.093 --> 17:43.194
So we reinsert Johnson
into his daily routine.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.196
And maybe the killer tries
to come after him again.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.331
Let's set it up.
I love it.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.634
SAM:
When I was a kid,

17:49.636 --> 17:51.669
Colonel Hanna was
all about discipline.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.305
He would make me run
15 miles in a week.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.440
That's good for you.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.075
Eh, it wasn't all good.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.177
One week, I slacked off
due to weather.

17:59.179 --> 18:02.146
He made me run 15 miles
in a day, in the snow.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.082
And where was he?

18:04.084 --> 18:05.683
Colonel Hard-ass
was in the truck

18:05.685 --> 18:08.486
following me, heat blasting.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.488
That's interesting.
What?

18:10.490 --> 18:12.190
Yeah, well, he was
in the truck,

18:12.192 --> 18:13.257
you know, he was
following you.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.726
Yeah, I just said that.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.628
He was following you.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.230
He was there.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.169
No one ever pushed me.

18:25.171 --> 18:27.238
People push you when they care.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.511
You turned out fine, okay?

18:33.513 --> 18:36.180
Shut up and let's go.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.483
Well, should we
hug it out, or...?

18:46.759 --> 18:49.293
We believe the suspect
has been scouting you

18:49.295 --> 18:50.695
for some time.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.163
Waiting for
the best time to strike.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.297
You mean like
a stalker?

18:53.299 --> 18:54.365
Why would anybody
be tracking me?

18:54.367 --> 18:56.367
We're still
putting that together.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.302
So what's next?

18:58.304 --> 19:00.371
SAM:
We have a plan,

19:00.373 --> 19:02.273
but it requires
your cooperation.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.775
Absolutely not.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.310
No, let's hear them out.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.412
They want to use you as bait
to smoke this guy out.

19:08.414 --> 19:09.914
It'll give us
our best chance.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.549
We'll be with you
every step of the way.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.783
It's too dangerous, Mike.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.286
This maniac already tried
to blow you up once.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.388
This is how Marines fight,
Nicole.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.857
Face-to-face. I don't have
the luxury of deploying

19:19.859 --> 19:21.626
an air strike from miles away.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.327
That's not fair. That's my job.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.596
And this is my job.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.498
It's my duty.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.934
What about us?

19:29.936 --> 19:31.369
What about Devin?

19:34.407 --> 19:36.507
Even more reason to do this.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.678
Cadet.
Sir.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.214
What would you do?

19:46.286 --> 19:48.786
We put our lives on the line
for the greater good.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.622
We don't run away from
an opportunity to save others.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.928
You heard the man.

19:58.431 --> 19:59.697
Let's get this guy
off the streets.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.433
Oorah.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.709
I need him back.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.378
He's in good hands.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.985
Come here.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.629
Gentlemen.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.831
Get you guys a refill?

20:33.833 --> 20:35.433
I'm good.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.736
Come on,
it's macchiato Mondays.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.504
Just coffee, black.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.540
Black? Wow, let's not
get too crazy, huh?

20:42.542 --> 20:44.342
What about you?
You want an apple juice?

20:44.344 --> 20:46.544
No.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.982
I'm starting to feel like
this guy's not gonna show.

20:50.984 --> 20:52.683
Are you sure
about this location?

20:52.685 --> 20:55.486
I stop for coffee here daily--
you could set your clock by it.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.288
CALLEN (over earpiece):
Well, if he's been stalking you,

20:57.290 --> 20:59.490
this place would be
the most vulnerable.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.527
Your son seems
like a good cadet.

21:03.529 --> 21:07.298
Just hope he gets the chance
to be a boy.

21:07.300 --> 21:11.035
Well, if instilling discipline
keeps my son off of drugs

21:11.037 --> 21:13.304
and out of a gang,
then I'm okay with it.

21:13.306 --> 21:14.739
Seems like
it worked out for you.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.342
Guilty.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.879
It's just, all this
pressure at that age--

21:21.881 --> 21:24.382
it's a lot to handle.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.384
It's good that his limits
are being pushed early.

21:26.386 --> 21:30.288
Could be here right now because
somebody pushed too hard.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.791
Noted.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.860
(camera clicking)

21:39.332 --> 21:41.332
NELL: Okay, Kens, we got
those license plates.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.000
Keep them coming.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.371
Guys, we got a bogey.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.810
ERIC:
All right.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.613
His name's Glen Frazier,
he lives in Sylmar,

21:55.615 --> 21:57.081
works at the
Beverly Center.

21:57.083 --> 22:00.818
No military experience
or affiliation.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.959
Check out blue shirt,

22:08.961 --> 22:11.028
messenger bag.

22:13.399 --> 22:14.699
NELL:
Name is Gil Jones.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.367
He wasn't in the military,

22:16.369 --> 22:18.502
but his father was,
and he did time

22:18.504 --> 22:20.471
in Chino for assault.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.540
This could be our guy.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.776
Don't spook him.

22:30.416 --> 22:31.816
Just like we
discussed.

22:43.629 --> 22:45.463
He's moving.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.552
Hi, honey.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.522
(engine revving)

23:18.464 --> 23:20.631
Thank you.

23:20.633 --> 23:22.566
I promised we'd get
you home in one piece.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.602
(man grunting)
DEEKS: Keep your hands

23:24.604 --> 23:25.903
where I can see them!

23:25.905 --> 23:27.738
Out of the car.
Out of the car.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.440
Get down.
Hands behind your back.

23:29.442 --> 23:31.409
You got no right.

23:31.411 --> 23:32.443
(handcuffs clicking)

23:32.445 --> 23:34.044
Hey, you got
nothing on me.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.613
KENSI:
We're secure!

23:47.960 --> 23:50.795
(clears throat)
Richard Mills.

23:50.797 --> 23:53.030
Military school dropout.

23:53.032 --> 23:56.000
Seems like you started okay
and then, uh, fell off.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.768
What happened?
Did you get your heart broken?

23:57.770 --> 23:59.570
You get picked last
in dodgeball?

23:59.572 --> 24:01.572
It had to be done.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.441
What? Run down a Marine
and a federal agent?

24:03.443 --> 24:05.976
In a sneaky hybrid at that.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.612
Those men had to go.

24:08.614 --> 24:11.032
Whoa.

24:11.033 --> 24:13.451
Wow. Here I was thinking that
we were gonna be here all day,

24:13.453 --> 24:15.753
and it seems like all we needed
to do to get a confession

24:15.755 --> 24:17.621
was to ask nicely.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.490
We should really remember
that for next time.

24:19.492 --> 24:21.592
Yeah, usually there's a dance
that happens where you show

24:21.594 --> 24:23.627
a little bit of reluctance,
we crack some head, but you,

24:23.629 --> 24:27.198
my friend, are making this easy,
and I, for one, appreciate that.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.800
You seem very eager
to turn yourself in.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.669
I just want
to get this over with.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.671
In due time.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.040
Just one question.

24:36.042 --> 24:38.476
Why? Why did
you do it?

24:43.649 --> 24:45.015
Th-They were evil men.

24:45.017 --> 24:47.218
Th-They didn't deserve to live.

24:47.220 --> 24:48.819
Wow.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.255
So just to clarify then...

24:51.257 --> 24:54.658
your plan is to rid
the world of evil men?

24:54.660 --> 24:57.928
I mean, you're on the wrong
side of the table, brother.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.897
We should be handing you
an application.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.899
See, what I don't understand
is why you cut off

25:01.901 --> 25:04.602
the index fingers
of the second

25:04.604 --> 25:07.671
and third victims,
but not the first?

25:09.775 --> 25:11.775
Well, the-the first, uh...

25:11.777 --> 25:13.511
Mm-hmm?

25:16.549 --> 25:18.749
Hmm?
I didn't have time
with the first.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.951
Time.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.220
Yeah, there's never
enough of that.

25:23.222 --> 25:26.290
But I think the correct response
would have been, uh,

25:26.292 --> 25:29.527
"I didn't cut off any fingers."

25:29.529 --> 25:31.762
Richard.

25:31.764 --> 25:33.731
Who are you protecting?
Why'd you try to run down

25:33.733 --> 25:35.065
Gunnery Sergeant Johnson?

25:35.067 --> 25:37.601
Who else is behind
the other murders?

25:37.603 --> 25:39.003
Answer the question!

25:39.005 --> 25:41.572
I'm so stupid.
You are so stupid.

25:41.574 --> 25:43.307
Stupid, stupid,

25:43.309 --> 25:45.643
stupid, stupid...
Hey!

25:45.645 --> 25:48.279
Richard.

25:48.281 --> 25:49.813
It's too late.

25:49.815 --> 25:51.582
You-You can't stop the
next one. It's too late.

25:51.584 --> 25:52.783
What's too late, Richard?

25:52.785 --> 25:54.151
You can't stop him.

25:54.153 --> 25:55.319
There's no stopping who,
Richard?

25:55.321 --> 25:56.987
(humming lullaby)

25:56.989 --> 25:58.556
Richard.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.724
Richard!

26:00.726 --> 26:02.593
Richard!

26:02.595 --> 26:04.595
Richard!

26:05.932 --> 26:07.998
(continues humming lullaby)

26:22.081 --> 26:25.616
Well, he's a few crayons
short of a full box.

26:25.618 --> 26:27.685
Yeah, he doesn't
fit the profile.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.787
You know, he's more like
one of those programmed kids

26:29.789 --> 26:31.622
than he is a killer.

26:31.624 --> 26:33.190
Yeah, but he tried to run down
Gunnery Sergeant Johnson.

26:33.192 --> 26:34.925
Under whose orders?

26:34.927 --> 26:37.795
More importantly,
these attacks may not be over.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.630
Why don't you guys
stay at him.

26:39.632 --> 26:40.598
We'll check in
with Eric and Nell.

26:40.600 --> 26:41.799
All right,
we'll switch it up.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.233
See what we can get.

26:46.238 --> 26:47.871
Eric, what else
do we have on him?

26:47.873 --> 26:49.139
Uh, not much.

26:49.141 --> 26:51.642
Car he was driving was
registered to his mother,

26:51.644 --> 26:54.645
Estelle Mills--
uh, married twice.

26:54.647 --> 26:57.615
First husband, Sergeant Ronan
Mills, was killed in combat.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.700
And the second,

26:59.701 --> 27:01.784
Sergeant Harris Posey--
looks like he just disappeared.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.854
More like he was taken out.

27:03.856 --> 27:05.322
ERIC: Uh, get this.
Richard has an older brother.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.124
David Mills.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.727
What do we have on him?

27:09.728 --> 27:12.329
Uh, military, completed
two tours in the Middle East.

27:12.331 --> 27:13.931
Dishonorably discharged.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.666
SAM: Why?
Huh.

27:15.668 --> 27:17.234
Issues with authority.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.372
Looks like he attacked
his commanding officer twice.

27:21.374 --> 27:23.624
Where do we find him?

27:23.625 --> 27:25.875
Last known address
was Pendleton, so...

27:25.878 --> 27:27.044
The mother?
ERIC: Still lives in Echo Park.

27:27.046 --> 27:28.212
All right.

27:28.214 --> 27:29.380
We'll pick up the mom.
See if you can

27:29.382 --> 27:30.748
find anything else
on the brother.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.416
Got it.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.402
Thanks.

27:34.403 --> 27:36.387
And you have the
opportunity to save him.

27:36.389 --> 27:39.123
You're not a murderer, Rich.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.125
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:41.127 --> 27:42.359
Oh, my God.

27:42.361 --> 27:45.396
Here's what we're...

27:45.398 --> 27:48.899
what we're
talking about.

27:48.901 --> 27:50.768
Sergeant George Rush.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.703
Right there. See that?

27:52.705 --> 27:55.005
Master Sergeant
Damon Duvall.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.975
And, of course, Staff
Sergeant Kevin Davis.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.277
That's who we're
talking about!

28:00.279 --> 28:02.680
DEEKS: Come on, I don't
have all day here.

28:02.682 --> 28:05.315
Richard! I'm getting really
frustrated, so I'm just gonna

28:05.317 --> 28:07.918
give you one more option: tell
me where we're gonna find him,

28:07.920 --> 28:09.420
or I'm gonna beat it out of you.

28:09.422 --> 28:12.756
It's true. It is true,
it's absolutely true.

28:12.758 --> 28:15.459
You're being used to...
Stop talking.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.728
DEEKS: We're just trying
to tell you how it is, man.
Richey?

28:17.730 --> 28:19.397
Tell me who he is.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.065
What did he do?
CALLEN: He tried to kill

28:21.067 --> 28:23.067
a Marine and a
federal agent.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.269
Can I see him?
I need to see him.

28:25.271 --> 28:26.870
Soon.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.972
We need to talk to you
about your family.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.044
Mrs. Mills.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.279
Yes?
Your husbands?

28:35.281 --> 28:37.481
Um...

28:37.483 --> 28:40.951
My first husband
was killed in combat.

28:42.755 --> 28:44.455
He was a good man.

28:44.457 --> 28:48.092
That's why I went back
to his last name.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.762
And your
second husband?

28:51.764 --> 28:54.364
Bobby?

28:54.366 --> 28:56.800
Went out for a pack of smokes
three years ago

28:56.802 --> 28:58.936
and never came back.

28:58.938 --> 29:01.171
How's that for a bad movie?

29:04.243 --> 29:05.509
SAM: How was the
relationship

29:05.511 --> 29:08.278
between your second husband
and your sons?

29:08.280 --> 29:11.215
He was hard on the boys.

29:11.217 --> 29:13.917
More so on David,
the older one.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.420
He may have
gone overboard

29:16.422 --> 29:18.055
a few times,
if you know what I mean.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.857
It was out of love.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.127
He said he was
making men out of them.

29:23.129 --> 29:26.096
Do you know where
to find David?

29:26.098 --> 29:27.831
No.

29:29.001 --> 29:31.535
I haven't talked to him
in a long time.

29:31.537 --> 29:34.872
I know you want to protect...
I don't know where he is.

29:41.347 --> 29:44.548
Mrs. Mills...

29:44.550 --> 29:47.885
tell us about your relationship
with your second husband.

29:59.799 --> 30:01.198
(clears throat)

30:04.537 --> 30:07.304
Mrs. Mills,

30:07.306 --> 30:10.207
as the son of a military man,

30:10.209 --> 30:12.309
I know what it's like
to have everything happen

30:12.311 --> 30:14.945
on a strict schedule.

30:14.946 --> 30:17.580
I would watch my mother hold it
together when he would deploy

30:17.583 --> 30:20.884
and then expect everything to
be perfect when he returned.

30:20.886 --> 30:23.887
It wore her down.

30:26.492 --> 30:29.126
I think you know what happened
to your second husband.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.295
It sounds to me

30:31.297 --> 30:33.263
like a son
protecting his mother.

30:35.234 --> 30:36.834
Help us find Davey

30:36.836 --> 30:38.535
before he hurts someone else.

30:38.537 --> 30:41.371
Anything you can
tell us will help.

30:45.578 --> 30:48.579
Can I see Richey now?

30:48.581 --> 30:50.514
He's not well.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.316
Neither of them are well.

30:52.318 --> 30:55.252
DEEKS: I'm gonna beat you
like I beat that chair!

30:55.254 --> 30:56.620
I'm gonna find this guy,

30:56.622 --> 30:59.289
and when I do, I'm gonna
tell him that you're the one

30:59.291 --> 31:01.558
that ratted him out!

31:01.560 --> 31:03.560
Please let me
see my baby.

31:03.562 --> 31:05.462
Where's David?

31:08.300 --> 31:11.335
At an abandoned school
in Woodland Hills.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.403
Cali-South High.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.640
Come with me, Mrs. Mills.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.609
Kensi, Deeks,
Sam's coming in. Eric,

31:18.611 --> 31:21.178
get me the information
on that school.
I'm on it.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.649
Oh. It's okay, baby.

31:25.651 --> 31:28.518
Mommy's here.
It's okay. It's okay.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.922
Shh.

31:31.924 --> 31:36.093
¶ Hush little baby,
don't say a word ¶

31:36.095 --> 31:40.664
¶ Mama's gonna buy you
a mockingbird ¶

31:40.666 --> 31:45.936
¶ And if that mockingbird
won't sing ¶

31:45.938 --> 31:50.507
¶ Mama's gonna buy you
a diamond ring... ¶

31:50.509 --> 31:53.644
ERIC: School was closed down
five years ago.

31:53.646 --> 31:55.913
Neighbors have reported
seeing lights at night.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.915
LAPD thinks
there might be squatters.

31:57.917 --> 32:00.617
Thanks, Eric.

32:06.992 --> 32:08.992
Second school today.

32:08.994 --> 32:11.929
Universe's way of telling us
it's never too late to learn?

32:11.931 --> 32:13.463
I was thinking
more along the lines

32:13.465 --> 32:16.934
of old dogs and new tricks.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.336
(gunshots)

32:22.274 --> 32:23.140
Need him alive.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.942
Federal agents!

32:47.566 --> 32:49.633
¶ ¶

33:18.497 --> 33:20.263
(grunting)

33:20.265 --> 33:22.466
(groaning)

33:23.202 --> 33:24.534
Put your hands behind your back.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.069
Hands behind your back.

33:26.638 --> 33:27.704
You got nothing on me!

33:27.706 --> 33:29.206
Shooting at

33:29.208 --> 33:31.074
a federal agent--
that's a pretty good start.

33:31.076 --> 33:33.410
Turn over. Turn over.
Get up.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.245
Sit up.

33:35.247 --> 33:39.082
(grunting)

33:39.084 --> 33:41.151
Stay down.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.691
I'm gonna take
a look around.

33:50.596 --> 33:51.795
(door creaks)

34:12.484 --> 34:14.551
¶ ¶

34:36.375 --> 34:37.808
CALLEN:
<i> Yeah, we picked up</i>

34:37.810 --> 34:40.343
your brother Richard.

34:40.345 --> 34:43.513
Must be kind of nice, huh?

34:43.515 --> 34:45.849
Your own personal army of one.

34:45.851 --> 34:48.151
It's a funny
thing though.

34:48.153 --> 34:51.188
Read your file,
and your brother?

34:51.190 --> 34:53.156
Was actually doing
pretty good till you got home.

34:53.158 --> 34:57.594
Good grades,
excelling at school.

34:57.596 --> 35:02.833
Maybe what your stepfather
was doing for him was working.

35:02.835 --> 35:04.601
Shut up!
He was on his way

35:04.603 --> 35:06.803
to becoming a productive citizen
till you interfered.

35:06.805 --> 35:09.139
You don't know us. You don't
know what we've been through.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.141
I know enough.

35:11.143 --> 35:14.411
I spent a little time
with your mom this morning

35:14.413 --> 35:16.480
in the interrogation room.

35:16.482 --> 35:19.483
You hurt Mother,
I will rip you apart.

35:19.485 --> 35:20.817
Is that what you did

35:20.819 --> 35:22.119
to your stepfather, huh?

35:22.121 --> 35:23.353
Did you rip him apart?

35:23.355 --> 35:24.588
My stepfather got

35:24.590 --> 35:26.156
what he deserved.
You served him up

35:26.158 --> 35:28.625
a little, uh... a little
home-cooked justice?

35:28.627 --> 35:30.127
Our stepfather
was suffocating.

35:30.129 --> 35:32.596
He never let us make a decision
on our own.

35:32.598 --> 35:34.365
If we veered off his path,

35:34.366 --> 35:36.133
he just beat us into submission
with the strap, belt,

35:36.135 --> 35:38.735
or whatever else he had handy.

35:38.737 --> 35:41.371
Is that why
you're doing all this?

35:41.373 --> 35:43.874
'Cause of what he did to you?

35:46.145 --> 35:48.912
I'm doing these boys a favor.

35:48.914 --> 35:51.314
Doing what they can't do.

35:51.316 --> 35:53.316
They should be thanking me.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.385
By leaving them
without fathers?

35:55.387 --> 35:56.920
I don't think so.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.855
I think you ruined their lives.

35:58.857 --> 36:02.259
And now your
life's ruined.

36:02.261 --> 36:04.628
Taking your brother down
with you. (chuckles)

36:04.630 --> 36:05.862
You're a real hero.

36:05.864 --> 36:08.632
Way to go.

36:08.634 --> 36:10.200
G?

36:10.869 --> 36:13.870
Bring him this way.

36:21.180 --> 36:23.313
(click, quiet whirring)

36:29.655 --> 36:32.455
Modified your little IED.

36:32.457 --> 36:34.424
Tell us who the
next target is,

36:34.426 --> 36:36.860
or you'll be joining
your stepfather.

36:54.413 --> 36:57.314
Ballsy to mess
with another man's toys.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.316
No, that implies
inexperience.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.418
I'm an explosives expert.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.453
Who's the next target?

37:03.455 --> 37:05.355
I'll disarm it
before you ever get there.

37:05.357 --> 37:06.723
You can try.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.658
I rearranged
the wiring configuration.

37:08.660 --> 37:09.793
You'll never figure it out,

37:09.795 --> 37:12.229
because I'm smarter
than you.

37:12.231 --> 37:14.731
Well, why don't I just
step off it now

37:14.733 --> 37:16.366
and take us all to hell.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.537
He doesn't have it in him.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.339
DAVID:
Well, it doesn't matter.

37:22.341 --> 37:24.007
It's too late anyway.

37:24.009 --> 37:26.009
We'll get it out
of his mom.

37:26.011 --> 37:28.712
Just pin the crimes on her, say
she was in on the whole thing.

37:28.714 --> 37:31.414
Mm, toss her in jail.
She seems pretty tough.

37:31.416 --> 37:32.682
She might last a week.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.484
Mother had nothing
to do with this.

37:34.486 --> 37:35.685
You can argue that

37:35.687 --> 37:36.987
when she's serving
hard time, okay?

37:38.757 --> 37:41.558
Who's the next target?

37:48.033 --> 37:50.867
(humming lullaby)

37:57.342 --> 37:59.409
(continues humming lullaby)

38:07.319 --> 38:09.819
Master Sergeant Shawn Lewis

38:09.821 --> 38:11.721
in Mid-City.

38:11.723 --> 38:12.922
(sirens approaching)

38:12.924 --> 38:15.058
He deserves to die.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.794
Just like you.

38:17.796 --> 38:18.862
(click)

38:18.864 --> 38:21.731
No. No, no, no, no, no!

38:21.733 --> 38:23.333
What did you do?!

38:23.335 --> 38:24.801
Guess he had it in him.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.637
What did you do?!

38:27.639 --> 38:29.706
(tires screeching)

38:33.745 --> 38:35.312
Kensi.
KENSI: What do you got?

38:35.314 --> 38:36.579
We got the next target.

38:36.581 --> 38:39.416
Master Sergeant Shawn Lewis
in Mid-City.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.984
Eric's sending you the address.
Meet us there.

38:40.986 --> 38:42.052
Copy that.

38:44.623 --> 38:45.588
Eric,

38:45.590 --> 38:47.023
any luck with Lewis?

38:47.025 --> 38:48.958
Master Sergeant Lewis's
phone is at his home,

38:48.960 --> 38:50.026
but he's not answering.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.594
All right, keep trying.
Got it.

38:51.596 --> 38:53.630
Hope we're not too late.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.803
DEEKS:
That's him.

38:59.805 --> 39:01.638
That's Master Sergeant Lewis.
Pull over.

39:01.640 --> 39:04.341
Master Sergeant Lewis?

39:04.343 --> 39:05.675
We're NCIS.
We have reason

39:05.677 --> 39:07.510
to believe you're the target
of an attack.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.579
What? What are
talking about?
We'll explain in the car.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.047
Right now, we have
to get you off the street.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.416
Can I stop by my house?
I'm less than three miles away.

39:13.418 --> 39:14.985
DEEKS:
No can do.

39:14.986 --> 39:16.553
It's possible that's
where the attack may take place.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.988
But my son Brian
is on the way there now.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.990
Well, then we need to go.

39:20.992 --> 39:22.625
Callen, we have
Master Sergeant Lewis,

39:22.627 --> 39:24.661
but his son Brian is on his way
to the house.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.763
He might be there already.

39:26.765 --> 39:28.698
DEEKS:
Go.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.066
(tires screeching)

39:39.611 --> 39:41.044
Here now.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.480
(tires screech)

39:46.752 --> 39:48.818
The back.

39:55.827 --> 39:57.894
(click, quiet whirring)
Brian!

39:57.896 --> 40:00.397
Brian!

40:08.907 --> 40:11.441
(gasping)

40:11.443 --> 40:14.010
What just happened?

40:14.012 --> 40:15.879
Where's my dad?
CALLEN: He's safe.

40:15.881 --> 40:18.014
He'll be here soon.

40:23.855 --> 40:25.088
How's the water?

40:25.090 --> 40:27.157
Perfect.

40:38.804 --> 40:41.171
I just got off the phone
with Officer Borders.

40:41.173 --> 40:42.739
She sends her regards.

40:42.741 --> 40:43.973
Well, I don't know about

40:43.975 --> 40:45.709
you guys, but I am starving.

40:45.710 --> 40:47.444
Thinking about hitting up that
barbecue place in the marina.

40:47.446 --> 40:48.645
Best brisket in town.

40:48.647 --> 40:49.779
Who's with me?
You buying?

40:50.682 --> 40:51.881
Oh, hell, I'll buy.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.483
Well, then I'm definitely in.
Sam?

40:53.485 --> 40:54.851
I'll catch up with you guys.

40:54.853 --> 40:56.786
You better hurry,
'cause you know there are limits

40:56.788 --> 40:58.154
to Kensi's generosity.

40:58.156 --> 40:59.856
Okay. Now
you're buying.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.925
Oh. Backfire.

41:06.765 --> 41:09.199
Oh, that you
and the colonel?

41:09.201 --> 41:12.769
Killed him
how I went Navy over Marines.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.604
It's weird.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.706
What's that?

41:16.708 --> 41:19.776
How someone
can affect your life.

41:19.778 --> 41:21.978
As gruff as he was,

41:21.980 --> 41:25.515
still grateful
for everything he did for me.

41:25.517 --> 41:27.917
Well...

41:27.919 --> 41:31.221
sometimes it takes a rock
and a feather for balance.

41:31.223 --> 41:33.223
Hmm.

41:33.225 --> 41:35.992
Brisket awaits, gentlemen.

41:35.994 --> 41:37.927
On our way.

41:37.929 --> 41:39.796
Rock or feather?

41:39.798 --> 41:42.532
Both.

41:43.768 --> 41:45.101
(chuckles)

41:45.103 --> 41:48.071
Sulley.

41:48.073 --> 41:49.272
What's that?

41:49.274 --> 41:50.640
Went to my
daughter's party

41:50.642 --> 41:52.008
as Sulley from
<i> Monsters, Inc.</i>

41:52.010 --> 41:53.810
Big, blue creature,

41:53.812 --> 41:55.945
furry horns, you know?
I never heard of him.

41:55.947 --> 41:58.014
You have a photo?
Get out of here.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.949
(chuckles)
You're not coming?

41:59.951 --> 42:01.918
No, no, no. I'll catch
up with you guys.

42:01.920 --> 42:02.952
All right.

42:09.561 --> 42:12.562
(dialing)

42:15.634 --> 42:19.569
(line ringing)

42:19.571 --> 42:22.939
MAN: Hello?
Colonel Hanna.

42:22.941 --> 42:25.975
It's Sam. Just thought I would
call and see how you're doing.
