WEBVTT

00:00.050 --> 00:02.416
My name is Cassie, and I see ghosts.

00:02.419 --> 00:04.858
Sometimes they send me a message,

00:04.861 --> 00:06.627
and sometimes they just show up.

00:06.629 --> 00:10.465
If you find yourself wanting
a little help from my side,

00:10.467 --> 00:13.534
just give me a holler,
and I'll come running.

00:13.536 --> 00:16.236
We're not a team. I never
want to see you again.

00:16.239 --> 00:17.538
I can't believe I'm saying this,

00:17.540 --> 00:19.054
but maybe reach out to Cassie.

00:19.057 --> 00:20.351
I saw some strange stuff,

00:20.354 --> 00:23.088
and I think it might
be related to your case.

00:23.091 --> 00:24.489
Who's Sally?

00:24.492 --> 00:26.280
My fiancÃ©e. She fell into a coma.

00:26.282 --> 00:28.816
It's like she's here, but she's gone.

00:28.818 --> 00:30.952
I can see if she'll talk to me.

00:30.954 --> 00:32.835
That'd be great.

00:40.230 --> 00:42.597
You're not going in there, are you?

00:47.103 --> 00:49.604
It's just a hospital.

00:49.606 --> 00:51.839
It'll be fine.

00:51.841 --> 00:55.076
Hospitals are always
crammed full of ghosts.

00:55.078 --> 00:57.578
If you need a bodyguard
to keep them off you,

00:57.580 --> 00:59.514
I'm available.

00:59.516 --> 01:01.082
Go away.

01:01.084 --> 01:02.750
Oh, come on, now.

01:02.752 --> 01:04.986
The quicker you agree
to let me help you,

01:04.988 --> 01:06.921
the quicker I'll be out of your hair.

01:08.925 --> 01:10.625
Why would you want to help me?

01:10.627 --> 01:12.593
Because I need to do some good,

01:12.595 --> 01:14.595
or I'll never get out of here.

01:14.597 --> 01:17.798
Now, I admit, I did some bad things

01:17.800 --> 01:21.168
when I was alive, and
for that, I'm truly sorry.

01:21.170 --> 01:24.338
But it stands to reason
if I start putting my chits

01:24.340 --> 01:26.274
in the "doing good" jar,

01:26.276 --> 01:28.042
mm, maybe folks up there

01:28.044 --> 01:31.445
will let me pass through
those heavenly gates.

01:31.447 --> 01:34.448
I help you, you help me.

01:34.450 --> 01:36.517
What do you say?

01:36.519 --> 01:38.452
I say find another sucker.

01:46.396 --> 01:48.796
Think I'll tag along with you anyhow.

01:48.798 --> 01:52.300
A hospital's a dangerous
place for someone sensitive.

01:52.302 --> 01:56.304
All the people who died in
there, all the pain, fear,

01:56.306 --> 01:57.972
that energy... it lingers.

01:57.974 --> 02:00.374
You can see it and feel it.

02:01.644 --> 02:03.477
I can ease you past the rough spots.

02:07.483 --> 02:10.184
It's only rough at first.

02:10.186 --> 02:14.522
Once I get inside, I can
figure out how to block it...

02:14.524 --> 02:16.525
most of it.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.913 --> 02:38.679
Get a move on, slowpoke.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.853
Going up?

02:45.855 --> 02:47.855
Yes, alone.

02:53.863 --> 02:57.187
SRS Tech to Pediatric Oncology ward...

02:57.190 --> 02:58.637
- Hey.
- Can I help you?

02:58.640 --> 03:00.067
I'm here to see Sally Bishop.

03:00.069 --> 03:02.203
Detective Asante called ahead about me.

03:02.205 --> 03:04.472
- You must be Cassie.
- Yeah.

03:04.474 --> 03:06.273
Thank you.

03:06.275 --> 03:09.039
Are you friends with Detective Asante?

03:09.042 --> 03:10.877
Something like that.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.880
Well, he seems very devoted.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.945
Let me know if you need anything.

03:16.948 --> 03:20.043
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

04:17.380 --> 04:20.148
I mean, like it was gonna be that easy.

05:07.940 --> 05:10.107
Oh.

05:12.338 --> 05:14.172
Was that you?

05:14.175 --> 05:16.909
Next time, warn a girl.

05:18.541 --> 05:22.176
Hey. Got you a tea.

05:22.178 --> 05:24.712
Guy said it tastes just
like a Yorkshire Gold.

05:26.015 --> 05:27.681
You're not even gonna taste it?

05:27.683 --> 05:30.217
There's no way that American
swill tastes like anything

05:30.219 --> 05:33.420
but weak, lukewarm, sugary piss.

05:33.422 --> 05:35.356
But I appreciate the thought.

05:35.358 --> 05:36.924
Anytime.

05:36.926 --> 05:39.693
Gentlemen, we've got a
body at Woodgate Memorial.

05:39.695 --> 05:41.195
- Patient or visitor?
- Staff.

05:41.197 --> 05:43.437
- Nurse fell from the roof.
- Suicide?

05:43.440 --> 05:45.770
You tell me.

05:45.773 --> 05:47.873
Officer Jansen.

05:47.876 --> 05:49.869
Good morning, detectives.

05:49.872 --> 05:51.071
Morning.

05:51.073 --> 05:53.407
So, what can you tell us?

05:53.409 --> 05:56.043
Uh, the deceased is Grace Morrow, 37.

05:56.045 --> 05:57.411
She's a registered nurse.

05:57.413 --> 05:59.343
Worked at Woodgate the past two years.

05:59.346 --> 06:00.781
She was in the middle of her shift.

06:00.783 --> 06:02.783
Told her friends that she
was taking a cigarette break.

06:02.785 --> 06:05.219
20 minutes later a
custodian heard a scream,

06:05.221 --> 06:06.720
came out here, and found the body.

06:06.722 --> 06:07.890
Anyone see her fall?

06:07.893 --> 06:09.890
We're canvassing, but nothing so far.

06:09.892 --> 06:11.325
Keep at it, and get somebody

06:11.327 --> 06:13.060
to pull security video from the rooftop

06:13.062 --> 06:14.562
and the stairwell, please.

06:14.564 --> 06:16.130
So what do you think, Amy?

06:16.132 --> 06:18.899
Spinal cord injuries
suggest she folded on impact

06:18.901 --> 06:20.273
like a closing book.

06:20.276 --> 06:21.602
She went over backwards.

06:21.604 --> 06:23.237
That's unusual for suicide.

06:23.239 --> 06:25.673
They don't typically scream either.

06:25.675 --> 06:27.741
Check out the bruising here.

06:31.581 --> 06:33.247
Well, those look like fingertips.

06:36.419 --> 06:38.085
This is where she went over.

06:38.087 --> 06:39.253
So, if someone was up here with her,

06:39.255 --> 06:40.921
maybe they asked for a cigarette.

06:40.923 --> 06:42.423
They step up close.

06:42.425 --> 06:43.991
As she's pulling it out of the pack,

06:43.993 --> 06:45.626
they grabbed her legs
and flipped her backwards

06:45.628 --> 06:46.760
over the ledge.

06:46.762 --> 06:48.629
Detectives?

06:48.631 --> 06:49.964
I'm Hal Weaver.

06:49.966 --> 06:51.632
I'm the administrator here at Woodgate.

06:51.635 --> 06:54.268
Please let him through. Thank you.

06:54.271 --> 06:55.638
Mr. Weaver.

06:55.641 --> 06:57.874
I just want to assure
you that the hospital

06:57.877 --> 07:00.273
will support your investigation
in any way that we can.

07:00.276 --> 07:01.775
Thank you. We appreciate that.

07:01.777 --> 07:03.177
We'll need to interview your staff,

07:03.179 --> 07:04.778
especially anyone Grace
considered a friend.

07:04.780 --> 07:06.359
Vanessa Shaw, she's a nurse

07:06.362 --> 07:08.527
at Pediatric Oncology.

07:08.530 --> 07:10.216
I believe she and Grace were roommates.

07:10.219 --> 07:12.152
- How well did you know Grace?
- Not very.

07:12.154 --> 07:14.521
I try to keep a professional
distance with the employees.

07:14.523 --> 07:17.024
Did Grace have any problems
with a staff member?

07:17.026 --> 07:18.959
Anyone that gave her a hard time?

07:18.961 --> 07:20.914
She never filed any complaints.

07:20.917 --> 07:23.481
Look, as far as I know,
Grace got along with everyone.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.033
I'm sure this is just
a terrible accident.

07:26.035 --> 07:27.868
We have to be thorough. You understand.

07:27.870 --> 07:28.898
Of course.

07:28.901 --> 07:30.970
Mr. Weaver, where were
you when Grace fell?

07:30.973 --> 07:33.641
A board meeting...
second-floor conference room.

07:33.643 --> 07:36.710
I heard a commotion, we ran outside,

07:36.713 --> 07:39.481
and that's when I saw it was Grace.

07:39.484 --> 07:41.273
Is there anything else you need?

07:41.276 --> 07:43.484
That's all for now.
Thanks for your time.

07:43.486 --> 07:44.985
Thank you.

07:44.987 --> 07:46.353
Anything?

07:46.355 --> 07:48.689
Security says that the
cameras in the stairwell

07:48.691 --> 07:51.358
and on the roof malfunctioned
sometime this morning.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.993
There's no video.

07:52.995 --> 07:54.453
Well, that's suspicious, isn't it?

07:54.456 --> 07:55.988
Apparently it happens a lot.

07:55.991 --> 07:59.832
The staff uses the roof as a
kind of unofficial clubhouse.

07:59.835 --> 08:01.335
People even come up here to fool around.

08:01.337 --> 08:03.103
And that's when they
knock out the cameras.

08:03.105 --> 08:04.838
Let's talk to Grace's roommate.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.840
Maybe our victim was meeting someone.

08:12.615 --> 08:16.551
Pediatric physician's
assistant, please call 5300.

08:24.648 --> 08:27.461
Any attending technician to
third floor Radiology, please.

08:27.463 --> 08:30.264
Any attending technician
to third floor Radiology.

08:53.289 --> 08:54.621
Hello?

08:56.792 --> 08:58.660
Hello?

09:00.596 --> 09:01.895
Hello?

09:09.572 --> 09:11.972
Who's there?

09:35.698 --> 09:38.832
Hey. Where are you going?

09:45.808 --> 09:48.275
Hey, there.

09:48.277 --> 09:50.778
Do you want me to come with you?

09:55.117 --> 09:57.951
Please don't be like
the kid from "The Ring."

10:06.210 --> 10:08.495
The basement. Of course.

10:27.328 --> 10:28.805
I'm Cassie.

10:30.611 --> 10:32.611
What's your name?

10:32.614 --> 10:34.480
Ethan.

10:34.483 --> 10:36.450
Ethan Grant.

10:36.453 --> 10:38.991
Well, it's nice to meet you, Ethan.

10:38.994 --> 10:42.596
- What are you doing down here?
- I guess I live here now.

10:42.598 --> 10:44.161
All alone?

10:44.164 --> 10:47.768
With a lady, but she doesn't
like me talking to strangers.

10:47.770 --> 10:49.820
Please get me out of here.

10:51.393 --> 10:52.573
Run!

10:58.347 --> 11:01.115
Leave my boy alone!

11:01.118 --> 11:09.086

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

11:10.175 --> 11:12.407
Hey. I forgot my coat.

11:14.747 --> 11:16.547
When you get downstairs, don't be alarmed

11:16.549 --> 11:18.015
if you see a lot of police around.

11:18.017 --> 11:19.583
One of the nurses had an accident.

11:19.585 --> 11:21.051
This morning?

11:21.053 --> 11:23.220
I guess she fell off the roof.

11:33.366 --> 11:35.866
This is just awful.

11:35.868 --> 11:37.401
Poor Grace.

11:37.403 --> 11:39.336
Um, h-how did it happen?

11:39.338 --> 11:40.738
We're still looking into it.

11:40.740 --> 11:43.874
Did Grace typically go
to the roof to smoke?

11:43.876 --> 11:45.242
Or to get some air.

11:45.244 --> 11:48.846
Did she ever meet with anyone?

11:48.848 --> 11:50.381
She never told me his name.

11:50.383 --> 11:52.383
But I got the feeling he was married.

11:52.385 --> 11:54.785
But he works at the hospital?

11:54.787 --> 11:57.755
She said he was a big shot,
so I assumed he was a surgeon.

11:57.757 --> 12:00.291
They're the most important
people around here.

12:00.293 --> 12:02.259
Grace was very close
to some of her patients.

12:02.261 --> 12:03.928
I'd like to break the news to them.

12:03.930 --> 12:05.362
Of course.

12:05.364 --> 12:07.631
We'll call you if we need anything else.

12:07.633 --> 12:09.266
- Thanks, Vanessa.
- Thank you.

12:11.304 --> 12:13.437
Hey, I just spoke to Forensics

12:13.439 --> 12:15.472
about those cigarettes
you found on the roof.

12:15.474 --> 12:18.042
Preliminary tests
identified two DNA samples.

12:18.044 --> 12:19.476
Ah, any matches?

12:19.478 --> 12:21.445
There's not enough
to run a full profile,

12:21.447 --> 12:23.948
but they said it's definitely
a male and a female.

12:23.950 --> 12:26.083
Grace's roommate thinks
she's dating a married man.

12:26.085 --> 12:27.298
Maybe a doctor.

12:27.301 --> 12:29.452
Can you start interviewing
the nursing staff, please?

12:29.455 --> 12:31.989
- I'll see if I can get a name.
- Thank you.

12:31.991 --> 12:35.727
Cassie? What are you doing here?

12:37.330 --> 12:39.330
I had one of my things.

12:39.332 --> 12:41.465
I came over to check it out.

12:41.467 --> 12:43.399
You must be here about the nurse.

12:43.402 --> 12:45.468
Do you know something about that?

12:45.471 --> 12:47.471
I saw a raven, and then there was

12:47.473 --> 12:49.813
some terrifying falling through space,

12:49.816 --> 12:51.841
and that is it.

12:51.844 --> 12:53.143
Got it.

12:53.145 --> 12:56.247
You should have just called me.

12:56.249 --> 12:58.515
You hate hospitals.

12:58.517 --> 13:01.685
I'm tr... trying to get a handle on it.

13:01.687 --> 13:04.121
Do you mind if I just step outside?

13:08.699 --> 13:10.832
I know you're busy, but
can you do me a favor

13:10.835 --> 13:12.568
and run a name for me?

13:12.571 --> 13:14.031
It's Ethan Grant.

13:14.033 --> 13:15.699
I think he died in the hospital.

13:15.701 --> 13:17.434
Looking for something in particular?

13:17.436 --> 13:19.795
Just if there's anything
suspicious about it.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.860
Okay. Yeah, we'll look into it for you.

13:21.863 --> 13:24.037
Sure, but in return, can you stay away

13:24.040 --> 13:25.442
from this place, please?

13:25.444 --> 13:27.177
The nurse's death may
have been a homicide,

13:27.179 --> 13:28.720
but either way, you and hospitals...

13:28.723 --> 13:31.179
not a good mix.

13:31.182 --> 13:33.182
You don't know the half of it.

13:44.030 --> 13:46.330
- Hey.
- Hey, Cassie.

13:46.332 --> 13:49.633
Ethan Grant, eight years old...

13:49.635 --> 13:52.202
he died at Woodgate two
weeks ago of neuroblastoma.

13:52.204 --> 13:53.704
So he was terminal.

13:53.706 --> 13:55.406
He'd been fighting it for two years.

13:55.408 --> 13:56.874
Tom spoke with his oncologist.

13:56.876 --> 13:58.842
He says they were hoping
this last round of chemo

13:58.844 --> 14:00.811
would shrink the tumor,
but looks like his body

14:00.813 --> 14:02.607
just gave out... nothing suspicious.

14:02.610 --> 14:04.848
Okay, thanks.

14:04.850 --> 14:08.218
And, uh, I'm sorry I didn't
get anything from Sally.

14:08.220 --> 14:10.102
Hey, thanks for trying.

14:10.105 --> 14:12.173
Yeah, bye.

14:14.359 --> 14:16.493
Neuroblastoma?

14:16.496 --> 14:17.828
Sounds like a bad one.

14:17.830 --> 14:21.231
Anything that kills
children is a bad one.

14:21.233 --> 14:23.734
Hey, now, don't give me that evil eye.

14:23.736 --> 14:26.503
I never took the life
of an innocent child.

14:26.505 --> 14:28.772
Pin a rose on you.

14:28.774 --> 14:31.985
In fact, I feel sorry for Ethan.

14:31.988 --> 14:34.789
Trapped down there
with the basement bitch.

14:34.792 --> 14:37.747
Bad enough he got done in by...

14:37.750 --> 14:41.452
- What was it again?
- Neuroblastoma.

14:41.454 --> 14:43.017
I sympathize.

14:43.020 --> 14:46.389
Now he can't even move
on to his greater reward.

14:46.392 --> 14:49.026
Surely his people are
waiting to welcome him

14:49.028 --> 14:50.794
on the other side.

14:50.796 --> 14:53.931
I reckon they're worried sick,
wondering where he might be.

14:53.933 --> 14:55.432
What do you want?

14:55.434 --> 14:57.968
It's about what you want, Cassie girl.

14:57.970 --> 15:00.437
You want to help Ethan.

15:00.439 --> 15:01.905
And I want to help you.

15:01.907 --> 15:03.774
Because you think entry to Heaven

15:03.776 --> 15:05.909
is based on a points system?

15:05.911 --> 15:08.445
And you're in over
your head on this one.

15:08.447 --> 15:11.415
What's in that basement
ain't a heartbroken lover

15:11.417 --> 15:14.485
or some sad spirit waiting for closure.

15:14.487 --> 15:16.720
You can't reason with it.

15:16.722 --> 15:19.790
Can't send it gently
into that good night.

15:21.394 --> 15:23.009
How do you plan to get her claws

15:23.012 --> 15:26.095
out of little Ethan so he can be free?

15:26.098 --> 15:28.132
I'll think of something.

15:31.837 --> 15:34.004
H-here's Grace's personnel file.

15:34.006 --> 15:35.506
And her activity log.

15:35.508 --> 15:37.674
Those ID badges they carry
track everywhere they go

15:37.676 --> 15:40.110
and everything they do...
literally everything.

15:40.112 --> 15:42.846
I spoke with several nurses
who worked with Grace.

15:42.848 --> 15:44.648
None of them knew about an affair,

15:44.650 --> 15:46.631
but they all described
her the same way...

15:46.634 --> 15:48.485
- sensitive.
- Sensitive how?

15:48.487 --> 15:50.821
Took the deaths of her patients hard.

15:50.823 --> 15:52.489
Need a thick skin for
that sort of stuff.

15:52.491 --> 15:53.790
Grace didn't have one.

15:53.793 --> 15:56.325
Some said she wasn't
cut out for nursing work.

15:56.328 --> 15:58.642
But they all claimed to have liked her.

15:58.645 --> 16:00.044
Thanks.

16:00.047 --> 16:01.831
Here's something.

16:01.834 --> 16:04.001
According to Grace's
log, about two weeks ago

16:04.003 --> 16:05.704
she requested a post-mortem test

16:05.707 --> 16:07.587
for a patient who died in the hospital.

16:07.590 --> 16:09.623
That seems to be the
first time she's done that.

16:09.626 --> 16:11.841
- What was she looking for?
- Ah, it's hard to say.

16:11.844 --> 16:14.178
I'll need someone to
translate the medical jargon.

16:14.180 --> 16:16.513
But the test was never performed.

16:16.515 --> 16:17.848
Why not?

16:17.850 --> 16:19.845
Because the patient was terminal.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.982
Neuroblastoma.

16:21.985 --> 16:23.387
It was Ethan Grant.

16:26.025 --> 16:27.946
Cassie's Ethan Grant?

16:29.808 --> 16:32.275
So Ethan Grant died of terminal cancer,

16:32.278 --> 16:35.019
but a nurse at the hospital
still wanted to check it out?

16:35.022 --> 16:36.622
Well, we're not sure yet.

16:36.625 --> 16:39.140
Asante's at the morgue with the M.E.

16:39.143 --> 16:40.475
decoding the medical data.

16:40.477 --> 16:42.444
But we checked Grace's schedule,

16:42.446 --> 16:44.813
and she was working
on the pediatric ward

16:44.815 --> 16:48.339
the night that Ethan died,
so maybe she saw something.

16:48.342 --> 16:50.191
Okay. What do you need from me?

16:50.194 --> 16:52.836
When you first mentioned
Ethan, you asked us to check

16:52.839 --> 16:54.838
if there was anything
suspicious about his death.

16:54.841 --> 16:57.339
- Yeah.
- I'm wondering if he said anything to you

16:57.342 --> 16:59.675
about the night he died,
because it's not often you get

16:59.678 --> 17:01.678
an eyewitness statement
from the deceased.

17:01.681 --> 17:04.954
It didn't come up. But I can go ask.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.238
Actually, do you know what?

17:06.241 --> 17:08.407
I-I don't really want you
going back to the hospital.

17:08.411 --> 17:11.621
I don't want to go back
either, but I kind of have to.

17:11.624 --> 17:14.424
The truth is, Ethan is...

17:14.426 --> 17:19.680
he's trapped down there with
this angry, old dead lady.

17:19.683 --> 17:24.464
She came flying at me all
like, "Leave my boy alone!"

17:24.467 --> 17:26.900
Cassie, the last person that
got involved with Ethan Grant

17:26.903 --> 17:28.707
is dead.

17:28.710 --> 17:29.876
We'll handle it.

17:29.879 --> 17:31.545
You're gonna handle Ethan?

17:31.548 --> 17:33.415
You're gonna go down in the basement

17:33.418 --> 17:35.964
and negotiate his release
with an evil spirit?

17:35.967 --> 17:38.401
No offense, but I go this.

17:38.404 --> 17:41.332
According to this request,
Grace Morrow wanted to run

17:41.335 --> 17:43.637
an ELISA test on Ethan Grant.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.808
- Why?
- Not sure.

17:45.811 --> 17:47.470
The test gauges enzyme levels,

17:47.473 --> 17:49.307
so she could've been
looking for several things...

17:49.309 --> 17:51.212
antibodies to certain
infectious diseases,

17:51.215 --> 17:52.425
for instance.

17:52.428 --> 17:54.195
Anything that might have
to do with his cancer?

17:54.197 --> 17:55.472
Not that I can think of.

17:55.475 --> 17:58.052
And according to his records,
Ethan had gone through

17:58.055 --> 18:00.889
a post-surgical round of
chemo shortly before he died.

18:00.891 --> 18:02.891
So his body would've been full of drugs,

18:02.893 --> 18:04.960
and his enzymes would've
been all over the map.

18:04.962 --> 18:07.862
If I were you, I would
check with Ethan's surgeon.

18:07.864 --> 18:10.065
Maybe Grace told him
what she was looking for.

18:10.067 --> 18:11.363
Why do you think that?

18:11.366 --> 18:14.367
Because it's the same doctor
who denied her ELISA request...

18:14.370 --> 18:15.722
Shane Vogel.

18:19.497 --> 18:21.433
- Dr. Vogel?
- Yes, what can I do for you?

18:21.436 --> 18:23.816
We're looking into the
death of Grace Morrow.

18:23.819 --> 18:25.253
Yeah, such a tragedy.

18:25.256 --> 18:27.410
She was a wonderful
nurse, a wonderful person.

18:27.413 --> 18:29.707
Grace had concerns
about a surgical patient

18:29.710 --> 18:31.987
that recently passed
away... Ethan Grant.

18:31.989 --> 18:34.035
Yes, she was very upset
when we couldn't remove

18:34.038 --> 18:35.570
all of Ethan's tumor.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.758
It was too close to
several major blood vessels,

18:37.761 --> 18:39.427
so we elected to put him back on chemo

18:39.429 --> 18:40.597
to further shrink the mass.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.097
- How was it going?
- Well, or so we thought.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.700
That said, his death wasn't
completely unexpected.

18:45.702 --> 18:47.102
He was a very sick little boy.

18:47.104 --> 18:51.072
Did Grace tell you why
she wanted an ELISA test?

18:51.074 --> 18:53.742
She didn't have any specific concerns.

18:53.744 --> 18:56.011
Seemed like more of
a fishing expedition.

18:56.013 --> 18:58.046
Honestly, she just
couldn't accept the fact

18:58.048 --> 19:00.472
that this bright little
boy we knew was gone.

19:00.475 --> 19:03.217
Now, I am wanted in surgery.
Is there anything else?

19:03.220 --> 19:04.285
No, that's all.

19:04.288 --> 19:07.349
Oh, except Grace told her
roommate that she was seeing

19:07.352 --> 19:09.786
someone at the hospital,
maybe a doctor on staff.

19:09.789 --> 19:11.458
Do you know who that could be?

19:11.461 --> 19:13.595
I stay away from hospital gossip.

19:13.597 --> 19:16.550
- Are you married?
- Divorced.

19:16.553 --> 19:18.086
Three times.

19:18.089 --> 19:19.888
Thank you.

19:19.891 --> 19:23.093
SRS Tech to Pediatric Oncology ward.

19:24.598 --> 19:28.142
SRS Tech to Pediatric Oncology ward.

19:59.343 --> 20:01.409
She said you have to go away.

20:01.411 --> 20:03.637
Ethan, if you want to leave here,

20:03.640 --> 20:04.879
I can help you.

20:04.881 --> 20:07.349
No, she said she'll
hurt us if we try to run.

20:07.351 --> 20:08.616
Who is us?

20:11.773 --> 20:13.325
We all live down here.

20:14.586 --> 20:16.186
Ah, here she comes.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.778
Ethan, what happened to you?

20:19.781 --> 20:22.096
Find Avery! Go!

20:22.099 --> 20:23.431
Ethan!

20:23.433 --> 20:25.223
Okay, thanks for letting me know.

20:25.226 --> 20:27.455
I-I'll talk to you later. Bye.

20:27.458 --> 20:28.958
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.171
That was Cassie.

20:31.174 --> 20:34.008
She said there are more people
like Ethan in the basement,

20:34.010 --> 20:36.211
and the old lady seems to be in charge.

20:36.213 --> 20:38.684
- What does she think it means?
- No idea.

20:39.825 --> 20:43.559
Tom, I just read your report,
and I need some clarification.

20:43.562 --> 20:46.096
Two weeks ago, Grace Morrow
asked for a post-mortem

20:46.099 --> 20:47.822
on a kid with terminal cancer.

20:47.825 --> 20:50.125
Now, do you really believe that
it was related to her death?

20:50.127 --> 20:52.114
Well, she was very upset
about Ethan's passing.

20:52.117 --> 20:53.448
That goes to her state of mind,

20:53.451 --> 20:55.651
but we've already ruled out suicide.

20:55.654 --> 20:57.525
Did you talk to the boy's parents?

20:57.528 --> 20:59.566
Do they think the death was suspicious?

20:59.569 --> 21:00.614
No, I called them.

21:00.617 --> 21:02.636
They were asleep at
home when he passed away.

21:02.639 --> 21:04.038
But they were very complimentary

21:04.040 --> 21:05.559
about the care he got at Woodgate.

21:05.562 --> 21:07.262
But you still think
there's a connection?

21:07.265 --> 21:09.399
It's one of several
leads we're following.

21:09.402 --> 21:12.546
I encourage you not to waste
too much energy on it, okay?

21:15.218 --> 21:19.053
You know, maybe she has a point.

21:19.055 --> 21:21.723
It is possible Ethan Grant
doesn't have anything to do

21:21.726 --> 21:23.059
with Grace's murder.

21:23.062 --> 21:24.925
Maybe the timing was just a coincidence.

21:27.062 --> 21:29.840
Come here.

21:31.435 --> 21:34.936
Okay, before Grace died, she
was concerned about Ethan.

21:34.938 --> 21:37.272
Her death brought
Cassie to the hospital,

21:37.274 --> 21:40.340
where she saw Ethan, so
it's not a coincidence.

21:40.343 --> 21:42.343
Cassie wasn't at the hospital yesterday

21:42.346 --> 21:45.223
because of Ethan Grant or Grace Morrow.

21:46.756 --> 21:48.656
She was there for me.

21:48.659 --> 21:50.727
I don't understand.

21:57.294 --> 22:02.004
I have a-a girlfriend in Seattle.

22:02.007 --> 22:04.007
She's in a coma.

22:04.010 --> 22:06.967
And Cassie went to see maybe if...

22:06.970 --> 22:08.803
well, if she could talk to her.

22:08.805 --> 22:10.472
And you asked Cassie to do that?

22:10.474 --> 22:12.051
She offered.

22:12.054 --> 22:13.887
But I just...

22:13.890 --> 22:15.856
I didn't say no.

22:15.859 --> 22:18.145
Look, I just didn't want
you thinking the universe

22:18.148 --> 22:21.316
was at work here when
Cassie was doing me a favor.

22:21.318 --> 22:23.036
I-I know.

22:23.039 --> 22:24.705
I should have told you.

22:26.644 --> 22:30.546
Cassie's been pushing this
gift away for a long time.

22:30.549 --> 22:34.551
But lately she seems to have
turned a bit of a corner.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.554
She's using it to do good things,

22:36.557 --> 22:39.225
like trying to help a friend.

22:39.228 --> 22:41.635
I appreciate you telling me.

22:44.741 --> 22:46.817
But I still think that
Grace's investigation

22:46.820 --> 22:49.387
into Ethan's death is
what got her killed.

22:49.390 --> 22:52.079
My hunch, not Cassie's.

22:52.082 --> 22:54.182
Then we just have to prove it.

22:55.819 --> 22:58.520
Nutritionist dial 2665.

22:58.522 --> 22:59.988
Can I help you?

22:59.990 --> 23:01.155
I hope so.

23:01.157 --> 23:04.492
I'm a family friend of Ethan Grant.

23:04.494 --> 23:06.160
I just wanted to say thank you

23:06.162 --> 23:09.364
to everyone who was so kind
to him while he was here.

23:09.366 --> 23:11.699
That's very nice of you.

23:11.701 --> 23:13.368
I meant to write a card.

23:13.370 --> 23:16.129
Maybe I can send a note later.

23:16.132 --> 23:18.345
Can I get the names of his nurses?

23:18.348 --> 23:21.129
He used to talk a lot about someone.

23:21.132 --> 23:23.010
I think her name was Avery.

23:23.013 --> 23:25.778
There's no nurse named Avery here.

23:25.781 --> 23:27.443
That's me.

23:27.446 --> 23:29.116
I'm Avery.

23:29.119 --> 23:30.885
Mind your business, young lady.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.489
It's okay, Carla.

23:32.492 --> 23:35.075
Cassie's with me.

23:42.387 --> 23:44.494
How did you know my name?

23:44.497 --> 23:46.067
Ethan told me.

23:46.069 --> 23:48.136
He said to keep an eye out for you.

23:48.138 --> 23:51.573
You can talk to Ethan
even though he's gone?

23:51.575 --> 23:53.975
I think it's because I'm sick...

23:53.977 --> 23:56.145
neuroblastoma, same as he had.

23:56.148 --> 23:58.248
But you can see him.

23:58.251 --> 24:00.084
And you're not sick.

24:00.087 --> 24:02.587
It started for me when
I was younger than you.

24:02.590 --> 24:04.424
But it just never went away.

24:06.663 --> 24:09.129
Can you help Ethan?

24:09.132 --> 24:11.098
He doesn't like it down there.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.727
None of them do.

24:12.729 --> 24:14.192
I'm trying to.

24:14.195 --> 24:15.395
But it...

24:18.501 --> 24:22.270
Did Ethan ever talk to you
about the night he died?

24:24.374 --> 24:27.275
Everyone says I don't
have to be scared of dying

24:27.277 --> 24:29.110
'cause it doesn't hurt.

24:29.112 --> 24:33.434
But Ethan says they're
liars and it does hurt...

24:33.437 --> 24:35.204
a lot.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.262
How did it hurt him?

24:37.265 --> 24:39.565
He said he was sleeping when it started.

24:39.568 --> 24:41.840
So he doesn't remember the beginning.

24:41.843 --> 24:43.009
But then...

24:45.228 --> 24:47.261
There was a rash on this arm.

24:47.263 --> 24:51.733
It felt like he was burning
alive but from the inside.

24:51.735 --> 24:53.583
He couldn't scream.

24:53.586 --> 24:56.154
He couldn't move.

24:56.157 --> 24:58.057
Then he couldn't breathe.

24:58.060 --> 25:01.995
Ethan says that's what dying felt like.

25:09.096 --> 25:11.679
I'm gonna start charging
you guys a consulting fee.

25:11.682 --> 25:13.950
Trying to establish a cause of death.

25:13.953 --> 25:16.754
Symptoms include rash, fever, paralysis.

25:16.756 --> 25:18.355
Onset was immediate.

25:18.358 --> 25:20.598
Was the rash on the arm
like at an injection site?

25:20.601 --> 25:21.603
Could've been.

25:21.606 --> 25:23.726
Sounds like an allergic
reaction to a drug.

25:23.729 --> 25:25.329
Maybe succinylcholine.

25:25.332 --> 25:26.921
It's a paralytic.

25:26.924 --> 25:29.932
Anesthesiologists use it to
keep intubated patients still.

25:29.935 --> 25:31.502
And it's also handy for killing people.

25:31.504 --> 25:34.138
There have been several
murder cases involving SUX.

25:34.140 --> 25:36.137
Usually the perp's in the medical field.

25:36.140 --> 25:38.108
Unhappy doctor injects his spouse,

25:38.110 --> 25:40.778
she dies within minutes...
looks like a heart attack.

25:40.780 --> 25:41.979
What about an autopsy?

25:41.981 --> 25:43.313
Well, that's the beauty of it.

25:43.315 --> 25:45.115
The drug is essentially just a pair

25:45.117 --> 25:47.284
of bonded acetylcholine molecules

25:47.286 --> 25:49.686
which naturally occur in the body.

25:49.688 --> 25:51.043
It's pretty much untraceable.

25:51.046 --> 25:53.290
Except for an ELISA test.

25:53.292 --> 25:56.328
If you were injected with SUX,
there would be elevated levels

25:56.331 --> 25:58.194
of succinic acid in your body.

25:58.197 --> 26:01.331
That's why Grace wanted to
order an ELISA test on Ethan.

26:01.333 --> 26:03.667
How common is an allergic reaction?

26:03.669 --> 26:05.169
Incredibly rare.

26:05.171 --> 26:07.571
Someone tried to murder
Ethan with an injection.

26:07.573 --> 26:09.573
Figured it'd look like
the boy died in his sleep.

26:09.576 --> 26:11.969
But Ethan was allergic, and
Grace noticed the reaction.

26:11.972 --> 26:13.977
And thank you, Amy.

26:13.979 --> 26:15.712
I'll send the bill in the mail.

26:15.714 --> 26:17.581
Double it.

26:17.583 --> 26:20.517
Why kill an eight-year-old
boy, one who's already terminal?

26:20.519 --> 26:23.086
Well, the only reason I can
think of is to end his misery.

26:23.088 --> 26:25.189
- But it wasn't the parents.
- Then an employee?

26:25.191 --> 26:27.324
Well, if it was someone at the hospital,

26:27.326 --> 26:29.393
Ethan won't be the only victim.

26:29.395 --> 26:31.195
The ghosts Cassie saw in the basement.

26:31.197 --> 26:33.197
We could be talking
about an angel of mercy.

26:33.199 --> 26:34.610
And if they've been killing patients

26:34.612 --> 26:36.031
who are already terminal,

26:36.034 --> 26:37.834
it's possible they've
been doing it for years

26:37.837 --> 26:39.023
with no one suspecting.

26:39.026 --> 26:41.179
So when Grace started
looking into Ethan's death...

26:41.182 --> 26:43.606
The killer knew they
were about to be exposed.

26:43.609 --> 26:44.835
Exactly.

26:44.838 --> 26:47.243
They lured Grace to the
roof and pushed her off.

26:47.246 --> 26:49.015
We need to identify the other victims.

26:49.018 --> 26:50.976
Let's start with the patient records.

26:53.419 --> 26:56.186
Thankfully, Grace Morrow
had the foresight to mention

26:56.188 --> 26:58.021
the rash on Ethan Grant's arm

26:58.023 --> 26:59.796
before she filed the ELISA request.

26:59.799 --> 27:01.691
That was enough to
get us a sealed warrant

27:01.694 --> 27:04.228
for Woodgate's medical records
for the last five years.

27:04.230 --> 27:05.529
Okay, but you're talking

27:05.531 --> 27:07.210
about thousands of
people, though, right?

27:07.213 --> 27:08.874
3,000 to 5,000, actually.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.567
We need to identify the two
dozen you saw in the basement.

27:11.570 --> 27:12.769
Oh.

27:12.771 --> 27:14.304
I-I know. I know.

27:14.306 --> 27:17.040
But we pulled out patients
who, just like Ethan,

27:17.042 --> 27:19.710
died in the hospital alone at night,

27:19.712 --> 27:22.212
and then we separated

27:22.214 --> 27:25.176
their intake photos from
their medical information.

27:25.179 --> 27:26.383
These are those.

27:26.385 --> 27:29.086
And you want me to
go through the photos?

27:29.088 --> 27:30.888
Is this police procedure?

27:30.890 --> 27:32.723
You're a witness.

27:32.725 --> 27:34.591
But let's keep it to
ourselves, shall we?

27:34.593 --> 27:36.429
Okay, I have to be at work in two hours.

27:36.432 --> 27:38.961
Until then, I'm yours.

27:40.466 --> 27:42.966
Where are we with the angel of mercy?

27:42.968 --> 27:45.469
Woodgate has nearly 10,000 employees.

27:45.471 --> 27:47.653
Almost a quarter of them
have direct or limited access

27:47.656 --> 27:49.406
- to succinylcholine.
- And the victims?

27:49.408 --> 27:51.642
Well, we're using Ethan
Grant as a baseline...

27:51.644 --> 27:53.835
pulling patients who are
classified as terminal

27:53.838 --> 27:55.112
but whose deaths were not expected

27:55.114 --> 27:56.480
for several more weeks.

27:56.482 --> 27:59.082
So far, we found 22
patients who fit the profile.

27:59.084 --> 28:01.184
Well, how can we narrow
down the employees?

28:01.186 --> 28:03.253
Everyone has to swipe their ID passes

28:03.255 --> 28:04.755
to gain access to the drug cabinet.

28:04.757 --> 28:06.687
We're correlating
employees' work schedules

28:06.690 --> 28:07.874
with patients' time of death,

28:07.877 --> 28:09.926
hoping someone ticks all the boxes.

28:09.929 --> 28:11.595
I found a match.

28:14.417 --> 28:15.649
Good afternoon.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.433
Detectives, what can we do for you?

28:17.436 --> 28:20.062
Carla Gainer, we're going
to need you to come with us.

28:20.065 --> 28:22.432
- I don't understand.
- What's this about?

28:22.435 --> 28:23.973
The murder of Ethan Grant.

28:31.463 --> 28:34.283
This is crazy. I
barely knew Ethan Grant.

28:34.286 --> 28:35.953
I try to avoid working peds.

28:35.955 --> 28:37.354
Because it's difficult?

28:37.356 --> 28:38.889
Because I don't like children.

28:38.891 --> 28:40.290
Look, check my activity log.

28:40.292 --> 28:42.159
If I was taking SUX from the cabinet,

28:42.161 --> 28:43.860
- there'd be a record of it.
- And there is.

28:43.862 --> 28:46.697
Your pass was used to
withdraw 100 milligrams of SUX

28:46.699 --> 28:47.898
the day Ethan Grant died.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.299
But I wasn't even there.

28:49.301 --> 28:51.335
I remember when I heard
the news about Ethan,

28:51.337 --> 28:53.254
feeling glad I'd gone
home with food poisoning.

28:53.257 --> 28:54.538
Avoided that drama.

28:54.540 --> 28:56.640
Are you saying someone
else used your badge?

28:56.642 --> 28:57.736
That's all I can think of,

28:57.739 --> 28:59.239
but I don't know how
it could have happened.

28:59.241 --> 29:01.210
We guard those badges with our lives.

29:01.213 --> 29:03.513
Hal Weaver is a fanatic about security.

29:03.515 --> 29:05.148
We need to confirm your alibi.

29:05.150 --> 29:07.517
Call Anne Freeman, the head nurse.

29:07.519 --> 29:09.820
She'll remember, because
it was a big nuisance.

29:09.822 --> 29:12.656
Grace was the only one that
could cover me last minute,

29:12.658 --> 29:14.424
but she had never
worked the night shift.

29:14.426 --> 29:15.425
Why not?

29:15.427 --> 29:17.494
Even though she had no
seniority at Woodgate,

29:17.496 --> 29:19.496
she still got special treatment.

29:35.781 --> 29:37.762
You've reached Tom
Hackett. Leave a message.

29:37.765 --> 29:39.601
Tom, it's me.

29:39.604 --> 29:41.046
I'm going through photos,

29:41.049 --> 29:43.406
and I think I found the
old lady in the basement.

29:43.409 --> 29:45.921
It looks like she was
a patient at Woodgate.

29:49.212 --> 29:51.390
I've never seen her before.

29:51.393 --> 29:54.263
But she wouldn't be on
the pediatric ward anyway.

29:54.265 --> 29:57.366
Yeah, I figured it was a long shot.

29:58.736 --> 30:01.370
It's just if I can find
out who that woman is,

30:01.372 --> 30:04.240
maybe I can figure out what she wants

30:04.242 --> 30:06.041
with Ethan and the others.

30:06.043 --> 30:08.411
Thank you for helping Ethan.

30:08.413 --> 30:11.247
It makes him feel less scared,
knowing you're working so hard

30:11.249 --> 30:12.484
to get him out.

30:12.487 --> 30:16.453
And I told him if I die,
I'll come and be with him

30:16.456 --> 30:18.287
so he won't be alone anymore.

30:18.289 --> 30:21.957
You're not gonna die
for a long time, Avery.

30:21.959 --> 30:25.961
You shouldn't say that
unless you know for sure.

30:25.963 --> 30:28.931
You're right. I'm sorry.

30:28.933 --> 30:32.468
People want to have
something positive to say.

30:32.470 --> 30:34.303
They want to tell you how strong you are

30:34.305 --> 30:36.421
and how you need to fight.

30:36.424 --> 30:39.817
But they don't know how hard it is...

30:39.820 --> 30:44.890
and how you basically never feel strong.

30:44.893 --> 30:46.815
But you know what I mean.

30:46.818 --> 30:49.318
You deal with all this awful stuff,

30:49.320 --> 30:52.822
and you feel helpless and sad,

30:52.824 --> 30:54.804
but you keep trying.

30:54.807 --> 30:58.493
Cassie, if I do die

30:58.496 --> 31:01.831
and I get stuck in the inbetween...

31:03.334 --> 31:05.167
Will you help me get back out?

31:09.229 --> 31:11.095
That's a promise.

31:15.203 --> 31:16.736
I spoke to Anne Freeman.

31:16.739 --> 31:19.421
She said anytime she scheduled
Grace for a night shift,

31:19.424 --> 31:21.350
she'd get a call from Hal Weaver

31:21.352 --> 31:22.952
with orders to change it.

31:22.954 --> 31:25.087
Pulling strings to get
Grace the better rotation.

31:25.089 --> 31:26.989
Sounds like the kind of thing
a big shot at the hospital

31:26.991 --> 31:28.791
- might do for his girlfriend.
- There's more.

31:28.793 --> 31:31.335
I looked into that badge situation.

31:31.338 --> 31:33.104
And Weaver's really strict about it.

31:33.107 --> 31:35.797
He's the only one who can issue them.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.333
We should bring him in.

31:37.335 --> 31:39.335
Mr. Weaver.

31:39.337 --> 31:42.939
Hope you have a good reason
for dragging me down here.

31:44.774 --> 31:46.173
When Grace was killed,

31:46.176 --> 31:47.984
you told us you were in a board meeting.

31:47.987 --> 31:50.378
But you neglected to mention
there was a 15-minute break.

31:50.381 --> 31:53.115
Coincidentally right when Grace
left her desk and went upstairs

31:53.117 --> 31:54.218
for a smoke.

31:54.221 --> 31:56.054
Did you call her on the hospital line

31:56.057 --> 31:57.957
to ask her to meet you?

31:57.960 --> 32:01.428
We know you and Grace
were having an affair.

32:01.431 --> 32:03.064
Yes.

32:03.067 --> 32:04.993
I called Grace from the conference room,

32:04.996 --> 32:06.962
and I asked her to
meet me up on the roof.

32:06.964 --> 32:08.964
- But I never made it up there.
- Why not?

32:08.966 --> 32:11.233
I got cornered by the head of the board.

32:11.235 --> 32:13.669
He said that somebody had
told him that I was planning

32:13.671 --> 32:16.205
to change my vote on the expansion plan

32:16.207 --> 32:17.573
which was not true.

32:17.575 --> 32:19.742
But it took 20 minutes
to unwind the confusion,

32:19.744 --> 32:23.468
and by that time, Grace was dead.

32:23.471 --> 32:25.271
Who was in that meeting
with you, Mr. Weaver?

32:25.274 --> 32:26.820
A couple of the directors...

32:26.823 --> 32:28.584
Wally Fitzgerald, head of the board,

32:28.586 --> 32:30.419
Katy Mead from the foundation,

32:30.421 --> 32:31.921
and Shane Vogel, head of surgery.

32:31.923 --> 32:34.089
Did Shane Vogel know
about you and Grace?

32:34.092 --> 32:35.757
Shane's a friend.

32:35.760 --> 32:37.760
I confided in him, yes.

32:37.762 --> 32:40.597
Because he can keep a secret?

32:40.600 --> 32:42.667
Would you do favors for him in return?

32:42.670 --> 32:45.900
Did you ever give him
extra security badges?

32:45.903 --> 32:49.271
Well, Shane's nurses
were particularly careless

32:49.273 --> 32:50.739
with their badges.

32:50.741 --> 32:53.675
Several times I remember
issuing a replacement badge

32:53.678 --> 32:57.244
for Carla Gainer while Shane waited.

32:57.247 --> 32:59.013
Thank you.

32:59.016 --> 33:01.850
Shane Vogel lied to us when he
said he didn't know who Grace

33:01.853 --> 33:02.886
was sleeping with.

33:02.889 --> 33:05.122
He knew Hal Weaver and
Grace were having an affair.

33:05.125 --> 33:06.420
We spoke with Wally Fitzgerald,

33:06.423 --> 33:07.519
head of the board.

33:07.522 --> 33:08.821
He says it was Vogel

33:08.824 --> 33:10.492
who told him Hal was
gonna change his vote.

33:10.494 --> 33:12.026
Vogel wanted to keep Hal downstairs.

33:12.029 --> 33:14.315
So Vogel jams up Hal,
then he goes to the roof

33:14.318 --> 33:16.479
to confront Grace about Ethan Grant.

33:16.482 --> 33:18.933
And if Grace hadn't figured
out that Vogel was the killer,

33:18.936 --> 33:20.292
she might have confided in him,

33:20.295 --> 33:22.203
said she wasn't gonna
drop the investigation.

33:22.206 --> 33:23.473
Well, he'd need to get rid of her

33:23.475 --> 33:25.308
before she spoke to anybody else.

33:25.311 --> 33:28.242
Can we prove Vogel
is our angel of mercy?

33:28.245 --> 33:30.779
We cross-referenced him
with potential victims.

33:30.781 --> 33:34.083
He operated on eight of
them, including Ethan Grant.

33:34.085 --> 33:36.251
Supervised residents on another 12.

33:36.253 --> 33:38.787
Now, we think this is patient zero.

33:38.789 --> 33:40.823
Ellen Rabe... she's
Shane Vogel's mother.

33:40.825 --> 33:42.124
The date of her death

33:42.126 --> 33:44.126
coincides with the
first replacement badge

33:44.128 --> 33:46.161
that Hal Weaver issued for Carla Gainer.

33:46.163 --> 33:47.997
Shane Vogel ended the pain for his mom,

33:47.999 --> 33:49.665
then he got a taste for it.

33:49.667 --> 33:52.067
He knows we brought in Hal
Weaver and Carla Gainer.

33:52.069 --> 33:54.003
He has got to assume
we're getting close.

33:54.005 --> 33:56.138
I'll get a judge to
issue an arrest warrant.

33:59.010 --> 34:01.176
Excuse me. Where's Shane Vogel?

34:01.178 --> 34:03.445
He said he had to check
on a patient in Pediatrics.

34:07.373 --> 34:09.440
- Shane.
- Put the needle down.

34:11.295 --> 34:13.254
I never wanted to hurt anyone.

34:15.292 --> 34:17.326
I became a doctor to help people.

34:17.328 --> 34:20.094
You do everything you can to
keep them alive, and for what?

34:20.097 --> 34:22.464
Prolong their suffering?
Drag out their misery?

34:22.466 --> 34:24.333
Another month? Another week?

34:24.335 --> 34:26.214
A day?

34:26.217 --> 34:27.934
It's cruel.

34:27.937 --> 34:30.638
Is that why you helped
your mother, Shane?

34:30.641 --> 34:31.964
Because she was in pain?

34:31.967 --> 34:35.376
I sat with her for hours
listening to her cry

34:35.379 --> 34:36.779
because it hurt so much.

34:36.781 --> 34:38.380
And then one night I saw it.

34:38.382 --> 34:41.949
It was a halo around her
head, and I knew it was time.

34:41.952 --> 34:44.887
And everyone I chose had that
halo because they were ready,

34:44.889 --> 34:47.121
even if no one else understood.

34:47.123 --> 34:50.059
In that room, just the two of us...

34:50.061 --> 34:51.193
we knew.

34:51.195 --> 34:54.730
You can't put me in prison,
not for helping people.

34:54.732 --> 34:57.566
And I tried to tell Grace,
but she wouldn't listen!

34:57.568 --> 35:01.904
Shane, I'm giving you
to the count of three.

35:01.906 --> 35:04.120
One...

35:04.123 --> 35:05.323
two...

35:09.547 --> 35:12.526
- No, Shane! No!
- I need a crash cart now!

35:14.486 --> 35:16.218
"Leave my boy alone."

35:16.221 --> 35:18.154
I thought she was talking about Ethan,

35:18.157 --> 35:19.423
but it was Shane.

35:19.426 --> 35:21.984
Well, even after death,
some mothers will do anything

35:21.987 --> 35:23.306
to protect their child.

35:23.309 --> 35:26.322
Yeah, and I guess she's still
thinking like a living person.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.451
The people Shane killed were witnesses.

35:28.454 --> 35:30.166
- They could talk.
- Right.

35:30.169 --> 35:31.521
Well, she wasn't wrong.

35:31.524 --> 35:34.265
Ethan talked to you... and Avery.

35:36.234 --> 35:38.602
What if Ellen doesn't know it's over,

35:38.604 --> 35:40.670
that Shane is dead?

35:40.672 --> 35:44.007
She could still be down
there holding on to them all.

35:54.486 --> 35:57.854
Going another ten rounds
with the basement bitch

35:57.856 --> 36:00.323
Ding, ding.

36:00.325 --> 36:04.561
Just out of curiosity, what's
your plan for the old lady?

36:04.564 --> 36:07.364
I don't have one yet.

36:07.366 --> 36:10.333
Well, I love me a good cat fight.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.535
Putting 20 on you, cottontail.

36:15.374 --> 36:17.474
I want you to go away, Ed.

36:17.476 --> 36:19.709
I mean it.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.444
You're a killer.

36:21.446 --> 36:24.314
You have no remorse
for what you've done.

36:24.316 --> 36:26.536
You're not getting out of the inbetween,

36:26.539 --> 36:27.639
no matter what you do.

36:27.642 --> 36:29.886
And I don't want your help.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.888
So go.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.514
Don't come back.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.570
Ellen?

36:47.572 --> 36:49.305
Are you here?

36:51.910 --> 36:53.576
Ellen.

36:58.249 --> 37:00.282
They know about Shane.

37:02.087 --> 37:04.420
It's over.

37:04.422 --> 37:07.290
He's dead.

37:07.292 --> 37:08.892
Liar.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.460
It's the truth.

37:12.597 --> 37:15.565
But he might still be close by.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.902
If you look, maybe you can find him...

37:18.904 --> 37:21.971
help him through this.

37:21.973 --> 37:24.941
Your boy's in pain.

37:24.943 --> 37:27.410
He needs his mother.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.317
Nicely done.

37:36.421 --> 37:38.254
Look at you.

37:39.791 --> 37:42.492
Like a box of Cracker Jack, cottontail,

37:42.494 --> 37:45.295
you are just full of surprises.

37:45.297 --> 37:47.830
Where's Ethan?

37:47.832 --> 37:50.066
A-and the others?

37:53.805 --> 37:55.305
No idea.

38:02.580 --> 38:04.881
I'm just saying, I'd feel better

38:04.884 --> 38:08.451
if I'd seen a big light, you know?

38:08.453 --> 38:10.353
Heard a heavenly choir or something.

38:10.355 --> 38:13.318
But there's just nothing.

38:13.321 --> 38:15.936
Look, I'm not an expert,
but if Ellen's gone,

38:15.939 --> 38:17.787
doesn't that mean the
others have gone as well?

38:17.790 --> 38:19.882
I mean, she was the only thing
keeping them there, right?

38:19.884 --> 38:20.904
Maybe.

38:20.907 --> 38:23.366
I just need to be
sure that Ethan's okay.

38:23.368 --> 38:25.869
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.952
Maybe she's not talking
to you on purpose.

38:42.954 --> 38:45.722
I mean...

38:45.724 --> 38:48.191
she didn't believe this stuff...

38:48.193 --> 38:51.861
psychic abilities,
communicating with spirits.

38:51.863 --> 38:54.163
Well, she wouldn't be the first person

38:54.165 --> 38:57.400
who's come around after
spending a little time with me.

38:59.637 --> 39:02.405
Well, either way,

39:02.407 --> 39:06.409
I know she would ask
you a million questions.

39:06.411 --> 39:08.745
How does it work?

39:08.747 --> 39:11.080
What's the best and worst part?

39:11.082 --> 39:13.383
Where does it come from?

39:13.385 --> 39:15.251
That one's easy.

39:15.253 --> 39:17.020
My mom.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.201
She had it, too.

39:18.204 --> 39:20.256
It must have made life a little easier.

39:20.258 --> 39:21.557
Not really.

39:21.559 --> 39:23.526
She hated it so much.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.161
She didn't want to understand it

39:25.163 --> 39:27.330
or deal with it.

39:27.332 --> 39:29.732
She just kept trying to make it stop.

39:29.734 --> 39:32.835
- Can you do that?
- You can.

39:32.837 --> 39:36.372
If you drink yourself into a stupor.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.275
Liquor dulls the senses, right?

39:39.277 --> 39:41.444
Even the sixth one.

39:41.446 --> 39:44.514
It quiets the voices.
It blurs your vision.

39:44.516 --> 39:48.351
But then it plays havoc
on your actual life.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.290
She died when I was 13.

39:56.561 --> 39:59.529
That's when I went to
live with Tom and Brian.

39:59.531 --> 40:02.131
Does she ever...

40:02.133 --> 40:03.900
visit you?

40:03.902 --> 40:05.201
Not once.

40:11.976 --> 40:15.478
I'm not getting anything. I'm...

40:15.480 --> 40:17.480
I'm sorry.

40:17.485 --> 40:20.249
It's okay.

40:23.145 --> 40:25.845
I'm not sure if there's
anything she would tell me

40:25.848 --> 40:28.415
that I don't already know.

40:28.418 --> 40:30.819
She loves me.

40:30.822 --> 40:32.594
She knows I love her.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.464
And this terrible thing happened to us,

40:34.466 --> 40:37.329
and it's not right or fair, but...

40:37.332 --> 40:39.732
it's no one's fault.

40:39.735 --> 40:42.227
And if she does recognize
the world around her now,

40:42.230 --> 40:44.130
then she knows I'm here.

40:44.133 --> 40:46.842
And I'll never leave.

40:46.845 --> 40:49.345
I'm waiting for her to come back to me.

40:52.350 --> 40:56.407
Pediatric physician's
assistant, please call 5300.

40:56.488 --> 41:00.257
Pediatric physician's
assistant, please call 5300.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.303
Cassie, hey.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.672
Hey. Hey yourself.

41:16.674 --> 41:18.875
- Is everything okay?
- I just heard.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.810
My cancer's in remission.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.678
- Oh.
- I get to go home.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.547
That is great news.

41:24.549 --> 41:26.349
Congratulations.

41:26.351 --> 41:28.217
- Thanks.
- Oh.

41:28.219 --> 41:30.019
My mom's on her way.

41:30.021 --> 41:31.721
But I'm glad I could say good-bye.

41:31.723 --> 41:34.223
Yeah, me too.

41:34.225 --> 41:36.726
- Take care.
- Thanks.

41:36.728 --> 41:40.563
Oh, Ethan says thank you, too.

41:40.565 --> 41:42.787
- He's all right?
- Oh, yeah.

41:42.790 --> 41:45.401
They all are.

41:45.403 --> 41:47.503
Thanks for telling me.
