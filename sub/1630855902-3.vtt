WEBVTT

00:37.439 --> 00:39.320
The world is complicated.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.719
We can never arrest all the bad people.

00:42.640 --> 00:45.359
At least, I have
those guys under control

00:45.359 --> 00:47.560
and they won't cause serious trouble.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.759
But even if they do,

00:49.759 --> 00:51.320
I know who to talk to.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.280
If anything happens out there,

00:54.799 --> 00:57.039
they almost certainly know something.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.520
How can we bailiffs

00:59.719 --> 01:02.920
work on cases without any informants?

01:03.640 --> 01:04.439
Right?

01:10.400 --> 01:11.439
Say something.

01:27.040 --> 01:27.959
I knew it.

01:28.879 --> 01:31.040
You don't respect me as your master.

01:39.239 --> 01:40.120
Master.

01:40.879 --> 01:42.239
Let me scrub your back.

01:48.439 --> 01:49.519
Sangeng.

01:51.280 --> 01:56.959
I'll send you to arrest all those scoundrels.

01:58.120 --> 01:59.159
What do you say?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.079
That's great.

02:03.439 --> 02:04.640
"That's great"?

02:05.760 --> 02:07.120
Nonsense.

02:09.479 --> 02:12.599
There are over 300 of them,
and you'll arrest them all?

02:13.120 --> 02:14.080
How?

02:15.039 --> 02:16.520
The key is to catch the leader.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.280
That's what I'll do.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.840
And then what?

02:20.360 --> 02:21.479
How do you convict them?

02:21.639 --> 02:23.000
They committed all sorts of crimes.

02:23.479 --> 02:25.479
There will be many
victims and witnesses.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.199
Victims and witnesses?

02:32.560 --> 02:34.960
They're experts in
threatening and buying off

02:35.639 --> 02:37.599
victims and witnesses.

02:37.960 --> 02:41.039
Are you going to
compete with them on that?

02:44.680 --> 02:45.800
How about this?

02:48.479 --> 02:50.479
Here's an assignment for you.

02:50.599 --> 02:51.960
From now on,

02:51.960 --> 02:53.280
check the income

02:53.280 --> 02:56.719
of those gangsters in secret.

02:56.719 --> 02:58.080
Keep the books

02:58.719 --> 03:01.479
and see how much
illegal income they have.

03:01.960 --> 03:04.240
If you ever
have a chance to go after them,

03:05.159 --> 03:06.879
gather evidence based on the books.

03:06.879 --> 03:08.000
Among all the cases,

03:08.000 --> 03:12.560
you're bound to find some
fearless witnesses who don't want money

03:12.719 --> 03:13.960
to testify for you.

03:17.759 --> 03:18.639
Master.

03:20.039 --> 03:22.840
They wouldn't tell me
what income they have.

03:24.159 --> 03:24.919
Besides,

03:25.360 --> 03:26.879
it's impossible to find out

03:26.879 --> 03:30.520
how much a legal business
is making without the ledger,

03:30.759 --> 03:33.000
let alone those shady businesses.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.240
How do I

03:35.680 --> 03:36.840
keep the books?

03:37.479 --> 03:41.360
I can't offer you any advice on that.

03:42.199 --> 03:44.520
You'll have to figure it out.

03:44.759 --> 03:46.479
Doing justice

03:47.080 --> 03:48.479
is way more difficult

03:48.479 --> 03:49.719
than scrubbing my back.

04:47.812 --> 04:52.010
=Ripe Town=
=Episode 3=

05:17.279 --> 05:18.439
Hello, Puppy.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.959
Get some water
from the well in the yard.

05:26.279 --> 05:28.279
Why are you suddenly planting a tree?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.519
I heard something happened to Feng

05:30.519 --> 05:31.560
so I came to visit,

05:31.920 --> 05:33.720
only to be held as a laborer.

05:34.199 --> 05:37.279
I wanted to fill the pit
for my uncle's body.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.120
But then I thought

05:39.720 --> 05:40.720
I might as well

05:41.360 --> 05:42.360
plant a tree here.

05:53.000 --> 05:53.959
What tree is it?

05:55.639 --> 05:56.399
Plum blossom.

06:15.399 --> 06:16.279
What did the coroner say?

06:20.519 --> 06:22.759
The fatal wound
was on the back of the head.

06:24.079 --> 06:27.519
The murderer hit him repeatedly
with that bronze ferule

06:28.839 --> 06:30.120
and smashed the occipital bone.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.360
There was a headless chick

06:34.680 --> 06:36.560
stuffed in your uncle's mouth.

06:37.879 --> 06:38.600
A chick?

06:39.800 --> 06:42.120
A fluffy baby chicken,

06:43.839 --> 06:44.800
beheaded.

06:50.839 --> 06:51.600
Mr. Feng.

06:55.000 --> 06:55.639
I'm okay.

07:03.639 --> 07:05.279
What is the County Magistrate
going to do?

07:05.399 --> 07:06.800
He realized it was a serious crime

07:07.959 --> 07:09.399
with two deaths in a row.

07:10.079 --> 07:10.800
So he started

07:12.480 --> 07:13.600
writing another report.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.600
So he believes that

07:17.000 --> 07:18.560
it's a serial killer responsible

07:18.920 --> 07:20.959
for your master and my uncle's deaths.

07:21.040 --> 07:21.600
Right?

07:28.680 --> 07:31.399
But the murderer
killed your master to seek justice.

07:32.079 --> 07:33.639
Why did he kill my uncle?

07:36.759 --> 07:41.199
Was Mr. Wang somehow
related to Captain Leng?

07:43.360 --> 07:43.839
No way.

07:43.839 --> 07:44.480
No way.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.839
I have another theory.

07:51.959 --> 07:54.000
The murderer has been here for school.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.040
Mr. Wang hit him
with the ferule many times.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.920
Later, the murderer
got wronged by Captain Leng.

08:01.319 --> 08:03.040
Since he had killed Captain Leng,

08:03.040 --> 08:05.560
he decided to take revenge
on Mr. Wang too.

08:07.839 --> 08:08.399
No.

08:08.639 --> 08:11.480
Then he would kill everyone
who has offended him.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.519
It will never end.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.759
No, no.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.160
No, no.

08:17.160 --> 08:17.800
Shicong.

08:20.399 --> 08:21.279
You're right.

08:21.279 --> 08:22.399
Am I?

08:25.240 --> 08:28.160
These messages are like
memorial speeches.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.480
But why these words?

08:32.879 --> 08:34.799
Yeah, why?

08:35.120 --> 08:36.559
Because they're lengthy.

08:38.720 --> 08:39.919
It doesn't make sense.

08:40.399 --> 08:41.440
If I wanted to

08:42.879 --> 08:44.399
kill only two people

08:45.759 --> 08:48.080
and leave memorial speeches as a ritual,

08:49.399 --> 08:51.720
then I would make them come in a pair.

08:52.559 --> 08:53.240
Good point.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.600
If the murderer
only wants to kill two people,

08:58.919 --> 09:00.159
then a couplet

09:00.159 --> 09:01.600
will be neater as a message.

09:03.279 --> 09:06.080
So he's most likely going to
commit another murder.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.039
Why did he choose

09:14.080 --> 09:15.960
this message out of all the sayings?

09:18.240 --> 09:18.559
Clad...

09:18.559 --> 09:19.440
Clad in attire

09:20.320 --> 09:21.440
in late spring.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.919
Grown and young ones.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.000
Bath in the Yi River,

09:29.799 --> 09:31.000
and the wind on the altar.

09:32.080 --> 09:32.960
Homeward with songs.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.320
You've been reading.

09:36.639 --> 09:38.679
I'm starting to read the Analects.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.360
This is an easy part.

09:41.879 --> 09:43.799
Confucius and his four students

09:43.799 --> 09:45.240
were discussing their ambitions.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.519
Three of them wanted
to be in high positions.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.879
But only Zeng Xi
said something different,

09:51.480 --> 09:52.799
which is this message.

09:53.679 --> 09:54.279
Then...

09:55.840 --> 09:57.159
I don't get it.

09:57.440 --> 10:00.480
It illustrated Zeng Xi's aspirations.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.639
He didn't aspire to be a high official.

10:03.960 --> 10:05.440
Nor did he hold any ambition.

10:06.559 --> 10:11.000
What he longed for
was a picnic in the spring.

10:11.399 --> 10:13.440
What he longed for... All right.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.679
You said that

10:14.679 --> 10:17.360
the murderer was
quoting sayings in a cynical way.

10:17.639 --> 10:19.879
He quoted the expression "young ones",

10:20.320 --> 10:21.840
and your uncle was a teacher...

10:29.759 --> 10:30.759
Speak your mind.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.480
If it was meant to show a longing,

10:33.799 --> 10:35.320
then the murderer quoted it

10:37.120 --> 10:38.120
to present something

10:39.000 --> 10:39.919
regrettable.

10:40.720 --> 10:41.720
He's implying that

10:42.559 --> 10:44.080
Mr. Wang has done something

10:47.080 --> 10:49.039
regrettable with the young ones.

11:12.480 --> 11:13.120
Sangeng,

11:15.159 --> 11:16.159
can you let me

11:19.759 --> 11:21.120
look into it first?

11:23.399 --> 11:24.279
Why?

11:26.639 --> 11:28.039
I want to investigate alone

11:28.159 --> 11:29.039
because

11:29.840 --> 11:32.200
it's not just about how he died.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.879
It's also about how he lived.

11:37.399 --> 11:39.679
You suspect that he had
done something unspeakable?

11:41.000 --> 11:45.360
I suspect that he had
done something horrendous.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.840
They're getting delivered to our house.

12:02.000 --> 12:02.720
Shicong.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.879
Your job...

12:05.879 --> 12:06.759
My job?

12:09.120 --> 12:09.759
Sangeng,

12:10.360 --> 12:11.679
my job doesn't matter.

12:11.759 --> 12:12.559
But you.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.960
Captain Yi is going to deal with you.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.440
You're no match for him.

12:19.000 --> 12:19.879
Go apologize.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.200
I prepared a great gift for him.

12:29.720 --> 12:30.440
A great gift?

12:31.200 --> 12:34.080
65 taels. 300 taels.

12:34.639 --> 12:35.559
80 taels.

12:37.639 --> 12:38.480
Qu Sangeng.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.960
What did you say it was?

12:41.639 --> 12:43.480
Assignment left by my master.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.159
I think it's useful to you.

12:45.879 --> 12:46.879
What do you mean?

12:47.720 --> 12:51.080
I heard that the gangs
made you their new leader.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.480
Someone has to contain those hooligans.

12:54.480 --> 12:55.759
Your master is gone.

12:55.759 --> 12:57.600
I have to shoulder the responsibility.

12:57.879 --> 12:59.879
What? Any objections?

12:59.879 --> 13:01.639
Not at all.

13:02.279 --> 13:03.279
I totally get it.

13:03.879 --> 13:05.480
That's why I'm giving you this.

13:05.759 --> 13:06.879
God knows how much

13:06.879 --> 13:08.320
they're making every month.

13:08.759 --> 13:10.559
It's not so hard if you want to.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.159
Well, that's new.

13:14.440 --> 13:15.360
Be more specific.

13:18.879 --> 13:21.240
The first category is the easiest.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.840
It's the "cleaning fee"
they charge from the small businesses.

13:25.159 --> 13:26.879
Go through the business streets

13:26.879 --> 13:28.679
and visit a few market fairs.

13:28.679 --> 13:30.000
Ask the business owners

13:30.399 --> 13:31.480
and you'll know.

13:31.480 --> 13:34.120
They have a fixed income every month.

13:34.519 --> 13:36.639
It does sound simple.

13:37.759 --> 13:40.639
Then, we have income
from casinos and loans.

13:40.759 --> 13:41.679
This money

13:41.759 --> 13:44.360
is exchanged into silver
at the banks every month.

13:44.559 --> 13:46.360
But of course, they wouldn't

13:47.240 --> 13:48.679
tell me the actual amount.

13:48.679 --> 13:50.480
I kept an eye on a few

13:50.480 --> 13:53.480
apprentice accountants
of some banks for months

13:54.039 --> 13:56.159
and caught them finding escorts

13:56.159 --> 13:57.759
and committing adultery.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.879
Then they became my informants.

14:00.679 --> 14:01.679
That's interesting.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.639
Next, they have several brothels.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.799
The Two Rats and Three Wolves
kidnap women

14:07.799 --> 14:09.240
and send them there.

14:09.799 --> 14:11.279
Thankfully, several fellow officers

14:11.279 --> 14:12.759
visit those places often.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.360
So I learned how much

14:15.840 --> 14:17.279
those women were sold for.

14:18.559 --> 14:21.279
I know those officers
you're talking about.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.840
Of course, they can't hide it from you.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.759
The major income
is the property and fields

14:25.759 --> 14:29.080
they obtain through faking bets,
blackmailing, and framing people.

14:29.559 --> 14:31.600
The property transfers
must be registered here.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.720
So I asked our clerks.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.600
That's pretty much of it.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.000
It wasn't so hard.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.759
It just took me some effort.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.000
How much effort?

14:44.480 --> 14:45.440
About three years.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.840
So much effort?

14:48.840 --> 14:51.200
Unfortunately,
I can't figure out how much

14:51.200 --> 14:56.279
they make from all other
less organized illegal activities.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.120
Sangeng,

15:01.720 --> 15:03.320
you've worked so hard.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.120
Yeah.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.399
Master said that
I shouldn't be his apprentice

15:06.600 --> 15:08.679
and should be an accountant.

15:09.919 --> 15:10.679
Sangeng,

15:11.440 --> 15:14.480
I'll keep the ledger here
and study it carefully.

15:15.399 --> 15:17.919
Can you tell me

15:18.519 --> 15:21.799
how much income
they have in total every month?

15:22.279 --> 15:23.840
Those Two Rats and Three Wolves

15:24.440 --> 15:27.240
make about
2000 taels of silver every month.

15:27.240 --> 15:28.039
So much?

15:29.480 --> 15:32.200
T-Then do you know how much they were

15:33.159 --> 15:34.120
paying your master

15:35.480 --> 15:36.879
every month?

15:37.399 --> 15:38.519
He never mentioned it.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.080
So I never asked.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.399
I guess it'd be less than 50 taels.

15:44.519 --> 15:47.720
I think that was how Master
gave one tael to everyone

15:47.720 --> 15:49.360
on the Hunter Squad.

15:54.000 --> 15:54.799
Qu Sangeng.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.600
This thing is worth a fortune.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.840
Why did you just give it to me?

16:03.480 --> 16:06.080
It's worth a fortune when you have it.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.200
It's worth nothing in my hands.

16:08.559 --> 16:09.879
I've figured things out.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.200
Master is gone.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.360
I need someone

16:12.679 --> 16:14.360
to look after me in the Yamen.

16:17.879 --> 16:18.600
Some days ago,

16:18.600 --> 16:20.399
I was reckless enough

16:20.399 --> 16:21.799
to have offended you.

16:22.039 --> 16:24.200
You're magnanimous, so please don't

16:24.519 --> 16:25.480
take it to heart.

16:26.879 --> 16:27.960
Get up, get up.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.559
Where does that come from?

16:30.200 --> 16:32.120
I heard that you were quite stubborn,

16:32.840 --> 16:33.799
ignorant,

16:33.960 --> 16:36.120
and full of yourself
because of your master.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.519
But it seems that

16:38.000 --> 16:39.399
you've come around it

16:39.399 --> 16:41.120
and proved yourself talented.

16:42.879 --> 16:43.679
Rest assured.

16:44.519 --> 16:45.600
From now on,

16:46.440 --> 16:48.879
work for me and I'll treat you better

16:49.240 --> 16:50.679
than your master.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.120
I don't need something.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.320
But that auxiliary bailiff
got implicated

16:57.960 --> 16:59.519
and fired some days ago.

17:00.039 --> 17:01.360
I feel so...

17:02.879 --> 17:03.799
No problem.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.960
I actually dare not accept your ledger

17:07.119 --> 17:08.160
if you don't

17:08.400 --> 17:09.759
ask for something.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.160
Just an auxiliary bailiff.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.359
Let him come back.

17:12.920 --> 17:14.200
I didn't mean it, anyway.

17:14.480 --> 17:15.400
Thank you, Captain.

17:15.640 --> 17:16.799
No problem.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.480
What's going on?

17:21.119 --> 17:22.559
What's with the calligraphy works?

17:22.680 --> 17:23.440
Exactly.

17:32.079 --> 17:32.839
Mr. Feng.

17:33.440 --> 17:35.319
We came here because

17:35.519 --> 17:38.720
we heard that you wanted to refund

17:38.720 --> 17:40.079
the tuition fees.

17:40.519 --> 17:41.559
Why did you give us

17:43.279 --> 17:44.559
these calligraphy works?

17:45.720 --> 17:46.680
It wasn't my idea.

17:47.519 --> 17:48.279
It wasn't?

17:48.799 --> 17:49.519
Whose idea was it?

17:50.200 --> 17:51.319
My uncle's.

17:52.839 --> 17:53.680
Mr. Wang?

17:56.519 --> 17:57.240
My uncle

17:57.559 --> 17:58.759
came to my dream that day.

17:59.079 --> 17:59.759
What?

18:00.599 --> 18:02.079
He was bothered by two things.

18:02.440 --> 18:03.319
First,

18:04.279 --> 18:05.240
the tuition fee.

18:07.799 --> 18:09.200
He accepted tuition fees

18:09.519 --> 18:12.759
but failed to teach his students.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.000
How can he rest in peace like that?

18:19.599 --> 18:22.839
Mr. Wang was indeed an honorable man.

18:24.039 --> 18:26.000
So these calligraphy works...

18:29.319 --> 18:31.759
After his funeral,

18:32.599 --> 18:35.279
his savings almost ran out.

18:35.759 --> 18:39.640
Thankfully, I'm skilled
in painting and calligraphy.

18:40.359 --> 18:42.279
And I'm known in Du County.

18:42.599 --> 18:45.559
I thought I could give you my work

18:45.759 --> 18:47.640
to pay back the tuition fee.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.400
What do you think?

18:49.599 --> 18:50.519
Gentlemen,

18:50.799 --> 18:53.640
what do you think?

18:58.519 --> 19:00.000
No problem.

19:00.359 --> 19:01.119
Mr. Feng,

19:01.119 --> 19:03.480
that's very kind of you to offer that.

19:04.599 --> 19:06.359
In that case,

19:06.680 --> 19:08.559
we will leave you to work

19:08.559 --> 19:10.400
and attend to our business.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.039
Wait.

19:11.880 --> 19:12.599
My uncle

19:13.319 --> 19:14.519
had another issue.

19:15.799 --> 19:16.440
He said that

19:16.880 --> 19:18.599
if the students got held back

19:19.200 --> 19:20.720
because of his sudden death,

19:21.279 --> 19:23.680
then he couldn't face the saints

19:23.799 --> 19:24.799
and our ancestors.

19:25.680 --> 19:26.839
He got really emotional

19:26.839 --> 19:27.960
when he was talking

19:28.400 --> 19:31.880
and ended up covered in tears.

19:32.319 --> 19:32.880
What...

19:34.039 --> 19:35.960
To comfort his spirit,

19:36.759 --> 19:39.519
why don't we get the students back here

19:39.799 --> 19:42.200
to study for another five days?

19:43.240 --> 19:44.440
I will be the lecturer.

19:47.039 --> 19:47.839
Mr. Feng.

19:49.839 --> 19:52.119
We know that you mean well.

19:53.440 --> 19:54.839
And we trust you.

19:55.279 --> 19:58.839
But after what happened here,

19:59.160 --> 20:01.240
I don't think it's a good idea

20:02.279 --> 20:05.160
for us to bring our kids back here.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.079
What do you think?

20:08.160 --> 20:09.000
That's right.

20:09.839 --> 20:10.599
Mr. Feng.

20:11.359 --> 20:13.559
I'm not a superstitious man.

20:14.559 --> 20:15.559
But someone died

20:15.759 --> 20:17.839
in this room, after all.

20:17.839 --> 20:19.240
My son

20:19.240 --> 20:20.720
is a timid child.

20:21.440 --> 20:24.039
Please pardon us.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.440
Pardon us.

20:25.960 --> 20:26.799
It seems that

20:27.119 --> 20:28.599
I was being inconsiderate.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
But my uncle said

20:34.480 --> 20:38.759
that he'd visit
his students in person if needed.

20:44.599 --> 20:45.599
If your son is timid,

20:45.880 --> 20:47.119
don't let him sleep alone.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.519
If my uncle visits your son

20:49.880 --> 20:51.799
and he can't recite the texts, then...

20:56.559 --> 20:57.759
I won't force you.

20:58.359 --> 21:00.519
Raise your hands
if you'll bring your children.

21:06.119 --> 21:07.599
Uncle, take a look.

21:07.839 --> 21:08.880
Don't visit the ones

21:09.119 --> 21:10.319
with their hands up.

21:14.079 --> 21:14.880
Thank you.

21:15.559 --> 21:17.200
Only a few won't come.

21:17.519 --> 21:18.440
You've saved

21:18.680 --> 21:20.519
my uncle some extra work.

21:51.480 --> 21:52.400
I want more.

21:53.200 --> 21:53.960
I want more.

21:54.039 --> 21:55.720
Sir, let me help you get in.

22:02.000 --> 22:02.759
Mr. Song.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.119
Teach me how to write poems next time.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.839
Why are you interested in that?

22:10.240 --> 22:11.640
I'm not so pretty.

22:12.519 --> 22:13.680
I have no musical talent.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.960
So I'm not presentable.

22:16.279 --> 22:18.240
Yingrui doesn't know music, either.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.720
But she writes poems.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.200
So she has more clients.

22:24.079 --> 22:25.720
Not everyone can write poems.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.519
Yingrui is so lucky.

22:30.440 --> 22:31.440
She can write poems

22:32.440 --> 22:34.240
and gets fresh fish every day.

22:38.319 --> 22:39.480
Fish tastes good.

22:42.720 --> 22:43.319
Chunxing.

22:44.359 --> 22:46.000
You can also have fish today, right?

22:46.000 --> 22:46.720
Yeah.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.000
All thanks to you.

22:49.119 --> 22:51.000
I've asked the chef in the kitchen

22:51.000 --> 22:52.240
to keep me a big one.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.960
Ms. Lin is so stingy.

22:58.240 --> 22:59.119
She can afford one or two

22:59.880 --> 23:01.759
even if you don't have many clients.

23:02.759 --> 23:04.839
But I have you, Mr. Song.

23:05.319 --> 23:07.200
You come once every month.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.400
I get to have

23:08.400 --> 23:10.440
fresh fish at least once a month.

23:18.519 --> 23:19.160
Chunxing.

23:20.400 --> 23:24.119
So do you want me
to come again this month?

23:25.079 --> 23:26.119
Of course.

23:28.519 --> 23:31.640
But will you skip the next month

23:32.839 --> 23:34.319
if you visit twice this month?

23:36.000 --> 23:36.880
Of course.

23:37.599 --> 23:39.880
I have to borrow money
to visit again this month.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.920
I must pay it back next month.

23:45.720 --> 23:48.119
Then you should come next month.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.079
Two times of having fish this month

23:50.960 --> 23:52.480
but no fish next month,

23:53.240 --> 23:55.240
it is worse than one per month.

23:56.119 --> 23:57.160
Why is that?

23:59.400 --> 24:00.839
Don't worry about the future.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.480
Isn't it great
to have fish twice this month?

24:03.759 --> 24:04.440
No.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.079
Because it's something to hope for.

24:20.880 --> 24:21.519
Chunxing.

24:24.440 --> 24:25.920
What if I stop coming

24:29.400 --> 24:30.200
or what if

24:31.640 --> 24:32.720
I visit someone else

24:34.279 --> 24:35.240
instead of you?

24:37.920 --> 24:38.640
Mr. Song.

24:39.680 --> 24:40.920
Did I say something wrong?

24:42.839 --> 24:43.759
I'm hoping for you,

24:44.640 --> 24:45.880
not the fish.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.759
I'm hoping for you.

24:54.519 --> 24:55.200
Chunxing.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.119
You should hope for

25:00.000 --> 25:00.880
the fish,

25:02.119 --> 25:03.000
not me.

25:03.720 --> 25:04.640
Remember.

25:05.519 --> 25:06.799
Don't put your hopes

25:08.359 --> 25:09.279
on anybody.

25:10.079 --> 25:10.799
Understand?

25:18.240 --> 25:20.799
I have to go.

25:23.640 --> 25:24.640
Mr. Song is leaving.

25:34.480 --> 25:35.240
Mr. Song.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.039
Your friend has paid for you.

25:37.799 --> 25:38.440
My friend?

25:39.240 --> 25:39.839
That's right.

25:42.799 --> 25:43.680
Mr. Song.

25:44.240 --> 25:45.240
There's your friend.

25:48.960 --> 25:49.839
Mr. Song.

25:50.759 --> 25:51.799
Greetings.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.440
Do you remember me?

25:54.279 --> 25:56.799
I'm Zhang Jizu,
the housekeeper of Mr. Xue.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.039
So it's you.

26:02.839 --> 26:03.680
Greetings,

26:04.880 --> 26:05.880
Mr. Zhang.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.039
Are your hands burned?

26:11.480 --> 26:12.559
My hands?

26:13.759 --> 26:15.119
Pardon me, Mr. Song.

26:16.119 --> 26:17.359
We don't know each other.

26:17.799 --> 26:19.599
Why would you pay for me if your money

26:19.599 --> 26:21.200
wasn't burning your hands?

26:22.519 --> 26:23.319
Mr. Song.

26:26.559 --> 26:27.839
Let me walk you.

26:29.079 --> 26:30.440
No need. I have my donkey.

26:30.440 --> 26:31.839
I can hold the reign.

26:31.920 --> 26:32.400
Come on.

26:32.799 --> 26:33.480
Go.

26:37.920 --> 26:38.720
Mr. Song.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.640
Let me be honest.

26:40.920 --> 26:42.359
I do need a favor.

26:44.480 --> 26:47.359
Next to the back door
of Cuihua Tower, in Yanzhi Alley,

26:47.359 --> 26:49.000
there's an unclaimed mansion

26:49.640 --> 26:51.000
abandoned for years.

26:51.599 --> 26:54.359
Can you sell it to me
on behalf of the county office?

26:54.559 --> 26:56.839
You'll name the price.

26:57.279 --> 26:59.559
You also get to decide how much

26:59.759 --> 27:01.039
to turn in to the county.

27:01.519 --> 27:03.279
The rest is for you.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.119
I know that mansion.

27:06.079 --> 27:08.799
It's not abandoned as you said.

27:08.960 --> 27:09.599
It's taken.

27:10.519 --> 27:11.200
It's taken?

27:12.559 --> 27:13.400
No way.

27:14.319 --> 27:15.759
I've asked around.

27:16.279 --> 27:17.640
It's been abandoned for years.

27:17.759 --> 27:19.240
The weed has grown tall.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.519
The house is about to collapse.

27:21.319 --> 27:24.319
Captain Leng told me
about that mansion last month.

27:24.319 --> 27:25.200
Captain Leng?

27:28.319 --> 27:29.759
The one who just passed away?

27:33.359 --> 27:34.400
He told me that

27:35.279 --> 27:37.079
the mansion was abandoned.

27:37.920 --> 27:41.079
The homeless and hooligans
would gather there

27:41.079 --> 27:42.359
and fight for turf

27:42.359 --> 27:44.079
every now and then.

27:44.359 --> 27:45.119
He asked me

27:45.119 --> 27:47.559
if the county office
could seal the gate with bricks.

27:48.559 --> 27:49.559
I looked into it

27:50.440 --> 27:51.880
and found out that

27:52.319 --> 27:55.599
the county had sold it to
a traveling businessman six years ago.

27:56.960 --> 27:57.440
But...

27:57.440 --> 27:58.000
Go.

27:58.359 --> 27:59.799
I checked on it some days ago.

27:59.799 --> 28:01.319
It was still abandoned.

28:01.839 --> 28:03.799
The Xue family has so many properties.

28:03.799 --> 28:05.279
Why do you want a crappy mansion?

28:06.799 --> 28:08.319
It's not for my master.

28:08.519 --> 28:09.839
It's for me.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.920
See, I'm in my forties and it's time

28:13.160 --> 28:14.240
to get married.

28:14.799 --> 28:16.079
I know that place

28:16.079 --> 28:17.519
doesn't have a good vibe,

28:17.759 --> 28:19.200
but it's inexpensive.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.839
I don't think you can get it.

28:22.799 --> 28:25.640
I heard that a traveling businessman

28:26.200 --> 28:28.079
bought it but never lived there.

28:28.079 --> 28:31.000
Nobody knows where he is now.

28:33.880 --> 28:34.680
No wonder.

28:35.839 --> 28:37.160
I checked on it some days ago.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.720
It was still abandoned.

28:39.720 --> 28:43.160
But there were
a few more items in the yard.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.160
How do you know about that mansion?

28:55.799 --> 28:58.519
It belonged to Chen Wang.

29:00.119 --> 29:03.200
The mansion
was right next to Cuihua Tower.

29:03.599 --> 29:05.039
It was the best place

29:05.640 --> 29:07.240
to kill Captain Leng.

29:08.039 --> 29:11.200
I wonder what Mr. Song can find out.

29:11.599 --> 29:14.359
Song Chen is no ordinary man.

29:14.960 --> 29:17.599
I heard that Captain Leng's apprentice

29:17.599 --> 29:20.480
was asking around
about that fire two decades ago.

29:22.480 --> 29:23.759
Keep an eye on him.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.519
Lu Zhi is long gone.

29:28.440 --> 29:30.039
They can't find out anything.

29:33.720 --> 29:34.920
The Lu Residence is huge

29:35.440 --> 29:36.680
with four yards.

29:37.480 --> 29:38.960
The side door was close to me.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.279
I remember clearly

29:40.519 --> 29:43.000
that the fire was the worst there.

29:43.039 --> 29:44.920
The fire was an accident.

29:44.920 --> 29:47.039
The candle fell and started the fire

29:47.039 --> 29:50.039
in the main bedroom in the main yard.

29:50.039 --> 29:52.640
It spread fast and the residence lit up.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.079
All four family members,

29:54.079 --> 29:57.559
the master Lu Jinxin, his wife Ms. Zou,

29:57.559 --> 29:58.759
his eldest son Lu Buyou,

29:59.039 --> 30:01.519
and his second daughter Lu Ping'er died.

30:01.759 --> 30:03.039
The housekeeper Lu Zhong,

30:03.039 --> 30:05.480
maids Shiliu and Haitang,

30:05.480 --> 30:07.799
and women servants
Ms. Zhang, Ms. Li, and Ms. Ji

30:07.799 --> 30:09.480
all died in the fire.

30:09.480 --> 30:12.079
The night watchman Qu Tianming
died trying to put out the fire.

30:12.200 --> 30:14.440
The night watchman Qu Tianming.

30:15.359 --> 30:16.359
Sangeng's father.

30:17.519 --> 30:18.440
I remember now.

30:18.440 --> 30:19.319
There was a man,

30:19.319 --> 30:20.279
their servant.

30:20.559 --> 30:22.720
Chen... Chen Wang.

30:22.960 --> 30:23.799
He survived.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.359
I heard he survived

30:25.359 --> 30:27.319
because he was extremely lucky.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.559
He was a gambler.

30:29.799 --> 30:32.279
He gained momentum
and went to gamble in the city.

30:32.279 --> 30:33.200
He made a fortune

30:33.279 --> 30:34.240
and bought a residence

30:34.799 --> 30:37.319
around Yanzhi Alley, I think.

30:40.880 --> 30:41.720
Yanzhi Alley?

30:43.160 --> 30:44.759
By the back door of Cuihua Tower.

30:46.359 --> 30:47.000
How...

30:47.680 --> 30:49.759
How do I know
about the back door of Cuihua Tower?

30:51.000 --> 30:51.839
And then?

30:52.119 --> 30:55.039
T-Then he ran out of luck,

30:55.039 --> 30:56.599
got into serious debt,

30:56.599 --> 30:57.599
lost the residence,

30:57.839 --> 30:58.960
and drowned himself.

31:00.039 --> 31:01.559
What was his name again?

31:02.240 --> 31:03.000
Chen Wang.

31:04.799 --> 31:06.039
Someone said that

31:06.440 --> 31:09.000
Lu Jinxin's adopted son survived

31:09.319 --> 31:10.200
that fire.

31:10.400 --> 31:11.079
Adopted son?

31:11.440 --> 31:13.240
Speaking of this adopted son,

31:13.240 --> 31:14.640
I've seen him before.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.319
He was 15 or 16.

31:17.839 --> 31:20.559
I heard that he was a beggar
who was starving to death.

31:20.559 --> 31:22.680
They brought him home

31:23.000 --> 31:25.519
to be a boy attendant for Lu Buyou.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.440
Lu Jinxin appreciated him

31:27.960 --> 31:30.559
and adopted him.

31:31.519 --> 31:35.119
What was his name again?

31:37.000 --> 31:37.599
Lu...

31:39.079 --> 31:41.640
Go find Lu Zhi if you want luck.

31:41.839 --> 31:44.039
Because he's so blessed.

31:44.279 --> 31:46.039
That's right, Lu Zhi.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.359
Boy attendant Lu Zhi, servant Chen Wang,

31:48.519 --> 31:50.640
guard Zhang Gui, and chef You Er

31:50.799 --> 31:53.079
survived.

31:54.000 --> 31:54.799
Mr. Liu.

31:55.039 --> 31:57.279
Where are those four survivors now?

31:57.920 --> 31:59.440
How do I know?

31:59.759 --> 32:02.400
We can't make them
report to the Yamen regularly.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.559
I want to check
their household registration.

32:07.720 --> 32:08.640
Household registration?

32:09.000 --> 32:09.720
Okay.

32:10.200 --> 32:10.960
Go ahead

32:11.160 --> 32:12.799
to the Archive Room.

32:13.559 --> 32:15.480
Sorry, I still have work to do.

32:15.799 --> 32:16.720
Check by yourself.

32:18.119 --> 32:18.680
All right.

32:19.279 --> 32:20.359
I will check by myself.

32:48.000 --> 32:48.799
Mr. Song.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.279
I checked the abandoned residence
in Yanzhi Alley.

32:54.359 --> 32:55.440
Any discoveries?

32:55.599 --> 32:56.240
(First,)

32:56.640 --> 32:58.400
(there was a mended spot on the wall)

32:58.599 --> 33:00.039
(that seemed to be a hole.)

33:00.559 --> 33:02.079
(Second, the millstone.)

33:02.359 --> 33:03.920
(It was never used.)

33:04.279 --> 33:06.359
(If it was used to grind rice or beans,)

33:06.680 --> 33:08.640
(there would be traces.)

33:09.079 --> 33:10.440
(The millstone was intact.)

33:10.440 --> 33:11.200
(However,)

33:11.519 --> 33:12.319
(it's weird that...)

33:12.680 --> 33:15.720
(There are stone maker marks around it)

33:16.640 --> 33:19.519
(as if the donkey had been working hard)

33:20.079 --> 33:21.240
(around the millstone.)

33:21.880 --> 33:22.960
(That's right.)

33:23.720 --> 33:25.880
(It doesn't require that much strength.)

33:27.559 --> 33:29.799
Master was killed there.

33:32.359 --> 33:33.279
How do you know?

33:33.640 --> 33:36.119
That residence was next to
the back door of Cuihua Tower.

33:36.680 --> 33:37.480
Cuihua Tower?

33:38.599 --> 33:40.400
What did it have to do with your master?

33:43.880 --> 33:44.640
Go on.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.599
(My master was strangled.)

33:52.359 --> 33:54.559
(The murderer must have blocked the gate)

33:55.000 --> 33:55.640
(and somehow)

33:55.640 --> 33:57.599
(lured Master to crawl through the hole.)

33:59.920 --> 34:01.640
I bet he wrapped a rope

34:01.640 --> 34:03.519
around Master's neck
while he was crawling

34:08.800 --> 34:10.239
(and tied it to the millstone.)

34:15.320 --> 34:16.840
(Then the donkey moved the mill)

34:16.840 --> 34:18.480
(and got Master hung on the pillar.)

34:28.239 --> 34:29.239
What are you waiting for?

34:32.400 --> 34:33.199
Go to work.

35:14.639 --> 35:15.880
Officers,

35:16.400 --> 35:17.920
what can I do for you?

35:18.159 --> 35:19.280
I'll do my best.

35:19.719 --> 35:21.159
Are you Si Baozhu, the stone maker?

35:22.039 --> 35:22.559
Yes.

35:22.760 --> 35:24.519
That's me.

35:24.519 --> 35:25.840
Come with us to the Yamen.

35:42.039 --> 35:43.000
The bamboo slit

35:44.599 --> 35:46.800
will pierce your finger under the nail

35:48.519 --> 35:50.320
for about two inches tops.

35:51.159 --> 35:52.119
But it will hurt.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.159
Once you are hurt,

35:54.719 --> 35:55.760
you may confess.

35:56.559 --> 35:57.599
Go ahead.

35:57.599 --> 35:58.719
Please don't, sir.

35:58.719 --> 36:00.239
Sir, I'm a stone maker.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.440
You can't destroy my hands.

36:02.440 --> 36:05.039
I have to sustain my family
with my hands.

36:05.480 --> 36:06.880
Let me give you a hint.

36:07.159 --> 36:08.259
Where were you on the eighth day

36:11.039 --> 36:12.000
of this month?

36:12.320 --> 36:13.199
I was at work.

36:13.199 --> 36:14.639
I've been working in my workshop

36:14.639 --> 36:15.519
for two months.

36:15.519 --> 36:16.679
I never left.

36:17.760 --> 36:18.880
Never?

36:18.880 --> 36:19.639
Never.

36:20.519 --> 36:22.360
No, I left once.

36:23.079 --> 36:24.800
In the middle of last month,

36:24.800 --> 36:26.119
I went to town

36:26.440 --> 36:27.960
and delivered the job.

36:28.079 --> 36:28.920
What was it?

36:29.119 --> 36:30.920
A millstone.

36:31.159 --> 36:34.079
My son and I delivered it
to the customer's mansion.

36:34.079 --> 36:36.519
It was in Yanzhi Alley.

36:37.159 --> 36:40.039
That place looked abandoned.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.360
Our customer
said he'd make it a tofu shop

36:42.360 --> 36:44.519
and ordered the millstone.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.679
What does he look like?

36:47.239 --> 36:48.280
He was

36:49.239 --> 36:50.800
about seven-chi tall.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.000
He was weird.

36:52.360 --> 36:54.039
He always had his straw hat on.

36:54.280 --> 36:57.440
It was raining
the day he placed the order.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.239
So it wasn't that weird.

36:59.239 --> 37:01.800
(But it wasn't raining
the day I delivered the millstone,)

37:01.800 --> 37:03.360
(and he still had it on.)

37:04.199 --> 37:04.960
Please take a look.

37:06.480 --> 37:07.079
Thank you.

37:09.039 --> 37:10.519
Let's go.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.119
You didn't see his face.

37:14.519 --> 37:16.760
I caught a glimpse

37:17.159 --> 37:18.920
but I don't know how to describe it.

37:20.199 --> 37:21.440
He had a heavy beard

37:21.440 --> 37:23.880
like those deity statues in the temples.

37:29.119 --> 37:30.079
Anything else?

37:30.400 --> 37:31.400
Nothing else, sir.

37:31.400 --> 37:32.400
I told you everything.

37:37.639 --> 37:38.840
You must tell the truth.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.559
I've seen that man before.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
You can't deceive me.

37:46.039 --> 37:46.840
Heavy beard.

37:48.079 --> 37:48.679
Oh right.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.559
His fingers are slender

37:51.000 --> 37:52.039
with long nails.

37:53.679 --> 37:54.320
Thank you.

37:58.719 --> 37:59.239
Come on.

37:59.239 --> 38:00.199
Take him to the cell.

38:01.599 --> 38:02.800
Sir, I told you everything.

38:02.800 --> 38:04.719
I'm telling the truth, sir.

38:04.719 --> 38:06.000
Sir, I'm wronged.

38:06.440 --> 38:07.320
I'm wronged.

38:08.239 --> 38:09.000
Sir.

38:09.480 --> 38:10.880
Sir, I'm wronged.

38:12.480 --> 38:13.239
Mr. Song.

38:13.239 --> 38:14.880
How long will we keep him locked up?

38:14.880 --> 38:15.840
Until we solve the case.

38:18.760 --> 38:19.440
What?

38:20.000 --> 38:21.360
500 taels every month?

38:21.920 --> 38:24.320
That's still nothing for you.

38:24.679 --> 38:26.880
Didn't we agree on
50 taels a few days ago?

38:26.880 --> 38:27.960
I didn't know

38:27.960 --> 38:30.719
you were making so much money back then.

38:30.920 --> 38:31.960
Gentlemen,

38:33.239 --> 38:34.400
throughout the county,

38:34.679 --> 38:35.639
all businesses,

38:35.639 --> 38:36.880
workers, and farmers

38:37.440 --> 38:39.559
are supported by the Yamen.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.480
How come you get all the money

38:41.760 --> 38:43.360
and we get nothing

38:43.679 --> 38:45.159
when it comes to your territory?

38:45.960 --> 38:46.719
Does it make sense?

38:46.960 --> 38:48.519
Cut the crap!

38:49.159 --> 38:51.760
Do you want my brothers to starve?

38:51.760 --> 38:52.840
You have brothers, huh?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.119
I have brothers too.

38:55.000 --> 38:55.920
Listen carefully.

38:56.159 --> 38:57.079
From now on,

38:57.719 --> 38:59.079
I want 500 taels every month

38:59.079 --> 39:00.519
without any exceptions. Also...

39:01.280 --> 39:03.679
I want extra when there are cases

39:03.960 --> 39:04.800
to settle.

39:13.800 --> 39:14.519
Captain Yi.

39:15.079 --> 39:17.800
We're talking business.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.000
Business is about negotiation.

39:20.719 --> 39:22.440
It's not supposed to be a threat.

39:24.599 --> 39:25.400
Are you cold?

39:27.480 --> 39:28.920
The water has turned cold.

39:29.440 --> 39:30.159
Guards!

39:30.480 --> 39:31.760
Bring some hot water.

39:32.320 --> 39:33.079
Coming.

39:42.960 --> 39:43.559
What's going on?

39:57.719 --> 40:01.440
I am the captain
of both Executer and Hunter Squads.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.119
Your lives are in my hands.

40:04.639 --> 40:05.679
You're talking business

40:05.960 --> 40:06.760
with me?

40:09.320 --> 40:10.639
You'd better be smart.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.840
Pay up to stay alive.

40:13.880 --> 40:14.719
Yi Youkao.

40:15.440 --> 40:17.079
Don't push us to the corner.

40:18.840 --> 40:20.320
This place is suffocating.

40:20.559 --> 40:22.320
You got overwhelmed

40:22.320 --> 40:23.679
and carried away, huh?

40:24.280 --> 40:25.119
Guys.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.440
Get them out

40:26.800 --> 40:28.480
for some fresh air

40:28.599 --> 40:29.480
to wake up.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.119
It's inappropriate to be naked.

40:58.119 --> 40:59.960
Give them a sheet to cover themselves.

41:18.159 --> 41:18.719
Mother.

41:18.880 --> 41:20.119
Sangeng, you're back.

41:20.880 --> 41:22.440
The lantern didn't go out, right?

41:22.719 --> 41:23.679
No, Mother.

41:23.960 --> 41:24.800
It is still lit up.

41:30.599 --> 41:31.639
What's wrong, Sangeng?

41:32.079 --> 41:33.159
What happened?

41:35.559 --> 41:36.440
Nothing, Mother.

41:36.760 --> 41:37.519
It's okay.

41:40.960 --> 41:41.480
Kneel.

41:43.760 --> 41:47.280
The Five Lords invite you over
to discuss business.

41:47.920 --> 41:48.480
Don't go.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.119
Sangeng, don't go.

41:51.320 --> 41:52.239
It's okay, Mother.

41:53.239 --> 41:54.599
I've been waiting for it.

41:57.639 --> 41:58.400
Lead the way.

42:22.599 --> 42:23.719
Gentlemen,

42:25.199 --> 42:27.079
why did you bring me here?

42:27.440 --> 42:28.280
Sangeng,

42:30.119 --> 42:31.840
we've been highly concerned

42:32.679 --> 42:34.960
with Captain Leng's death.

42:35.079 --> 42:38.079
We've been working hard

42:38.199 --> 42:40.000
to gather evidence these days

42:40.320 --> 42:43.199
and actually discovered something.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.519
The widow Ms. Zhao in Ping'an Village

42:49.519 --> 42:52.400
got hooked up with Wang Shun,
the second leader of the porter agency.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.639
Her late husband

42:54.800 --> 42:55.800
was Wu Jinlong.

42:55.800 --> 42:58.079
He was arrested by Captain Leng

42:58.079 --> 42:59.440
for assault and murder.

42:59.440 --> 43:01.639
Liu Shitou from Siyanjing Street

43:01.639 --> 43:02.840
came back recently.

43:03.039 --> 43:06.199
He was once arrested
by Captain Leng for burglary

43:06.440 --> 43:07.440
and got 40 batons.

43:07.519 --> 43:08.239
First Lord,

43:08.960 --> 43:10.599
let me read it by myself.

43:22.119 --> 43:23.519
Thank you, gentlemen.

43:23.519 --> 43:24.960
I'll keep an eye on all of them.

43:25.400 --> 43:27.079
Please keep investigating

43:27.679 --> 43:28.960
and help me solve the case.

43:30.280 --> 43:31.199
Of course.

43:31.199 --> 43:32.039
So I will

43:33.320 --> 43:34.480
leave you to rest.

43:35.920 --> 43:36.599
Sangeng,

43:37.039 --> 43:38.679
what's the rush?

43:38.679 --> 43:40.840
We prepared some dishes and drinks

43:41.039 --> 43:43.679
to share with you.

43:43.679 --> 43:44.400
First Lord,

43:45.480 --> 43:47.119
I'll cut to the chase.

43:47.360 --> 43:48.480
You didn't

43:49.239 --> 43:50.800
bring me here to share the clues

43:51.360 --> 43:52.880
or the drinks with me.

43:54.280 --> 43:55.719
I'll cut to the chase too.

43:55.880 --> 43:57.480
I do need a favor.

43:57.480 --> 43:59.880
Forget it if it's about Captain Yi.

44:00.119 --> 44:01.920
He's the captain of both squads.

44:02.280 --> 44:05.679
I can't help you
as an insignificant bailiff.

44:07.079 --> 44:07.760
Sangeng,

44:08.039 --> 44:09.440
please don't say that.

44:09.800 --> 44:11.679
Only you stand a chance

44:11.800 --> 44:13.159
against Captain Yi.

44:13.559 --> 44:14.360
Sangeng,

44:14.360 --> 44:15.519
if you don't help us,

44:16.119 --> 44:18.360
we'll be overwhelmed
by the monthly offering

44:18.440 --> 44:19.480
he asks for.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.039
We won't have

44:22.320 --> 44:23.360
extra time

44:23.519 --> 44:25.480
for other things.

44:26.159 --> 44:27.440
Are you saying that

44:28.679 --> 44:31.039
if I don't help you
deal with Captain Yi,

44:32.159 --> 44:34.840
you can't keep
looking into my master's case?

44:35.599 --> 44:36.920
We'd love to,

44:38.679 --> 44:40.559
but we'll be overwhelmed.

44:40.960 --> 44:41.639
My Lord,

44:42.360 --> 44:44.599
Captain Yi only wants money.

44:45.440 --> 44:47.119
Just threaten him a bit.

44:48.239 --> 44:50.840
Your men are skilled

44:50.840 --> 44:53.159
in all kinds of illegal activities.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.360
To be honest,

44:57.480 --> 44:59.880
you can even secretly get him...

45:03.320 --> 45:05.400
I don't think it's hard for you.

45:08.280 --> 45:09.039
No way.

45:09.440 --> 45:10.599
We can't do that.

45:10.599 --> 45:11.719
Why not?

45:13.079 --> 45:14.039
Sangeng,

45:15.199 --> 45:17.239
you know that

45:17.519 --> 45:19.360
robbers,

45:19.679 --> 45:20.679
bandits,

45:20.679 --> 45:22.679
and burglars

45:23.119 --> 45:25.440
can claim to be outlaws.

45:25.719 --> 45:28.639
But we Fang gangs and Da gangs

45:29.360 --> 45:30.119
cannot do that.

45:31.960 --> 45:32.880
Why not?

45:34.440 --> 45:36.079
Because we work for the Yamen

45:36.199 --> 45:38.039
just like you.

45:48.159 --> 45:49.000
What did you say?

45:49.679 --> 45:51.639
All the county people

45:52.039 --> 45:54.599
are terrified by us.

45:55.039 --> 45:56.639
Is it because we're powerful?

45:56.800 --> 45:57.559
No.

45:57.800 --> 45:59.519
It's because of the Yamen.

46:00.760 --> 46:02.480
The county people are scared of us

46:02.480 --> 46:05.280
not because we're merciless gangsters,

46:05.440 --> 46:07.880
but because the Yamen
never comes after us

46:07.880 --> 46:10.159
no matter what we do.

46:10.159 --> 46:12.679
So we set up a rule.

46:12.679 --> 46:13.639
What is it?

46:14.079 --> 46:15.440
Never hurt an official.

46:15.679 --> 46:16.719
So,

46:17.400 --> 46:20.159
you Five Lords dare not
hurt a captain in the Yamen

46:21.199 --> 46:23.440
although everyone's scared of you.

46:24.320 --> 46:25.920
We certainly dare not.

46:30.280 --> 46:30.880
My Lord,

46:32.039 --> 46:34.639
I don't think you're only

46:35.079 --> 46:36.719
paying off captains

46:36.719 --> 46:38.719
of the Hunter Squads, right?

46:41.480 --> 46:42.480
Normally,

46:43.360 --> 46:45.000
the judge of a county

46:45.559 --> 46:47.360
is in charge of trials.

46:47.960 --> 46:50.360
He's the one we should pay off.

46:51.039 --> 46:53.360
For example, Mr. Ma
from our neighboring Zhong County

46:53.360 --> 46:55.239
takes great care of us.

46:56.400 --> 46:57.920
But look at Mr. Song here,

46:57.920 --> 47:00.079
totally unapproachable
and unpredictable.

47:00.280 --> 47:01.840
We don't know his background.

47:01.840 --> 47:04.079
Even the county magistrates
can't handle him.

47:04.280 --> 47:05.360
How can we

47:05.360 --> 47:07.519
possibly pay him off?

47:07.679 --> 47:08.840
Have you tried it?

47:09.000 --> 47:10.159
Of course.

47:10.840 --> 47:13.519
Nobody hates people who bring gifts.

47:14.199 --> 47:15.440
But Mr. Song

47:15.639 --> 47:17.079
hates them with a passion.

47:17.199 --> 47:19.400
Other officials accept bribery.

47:19.400 --> 47:20.119
But nobody

47:22.119 --> 47:23.880
dares to bribe Mr. Song anymore.

47:24.400 --> 47:25.599
I know that.

47:25.840 --> 47:27.840
And that's the solution.

47:29.840 --> 47:30.840
What is it?

47:31.199 --> 47:34.119
Let Captain Yi
take the money to Mr. Song.

47:34.440 --> 47:35.199
No.

47:35.440 --> 47:36.679
No, no.

47:37.320 --> 47:40.039
Even we know what Mr. Song is like.

47:40.760 --> 47:42.679
Why would Captain Yi take the risk?

47:42.679 --> 47:44.639
As long as he gets paid well,

47:46.559 --> 47:48.880
Captain Yi will take
all the risks in the world.

47:53.320 --> 47:54.599
I see.

47:54.840 --> 47:57.480
We just need to offer enough money.

47:57.480 --> 47:59.320
Let's take a bet.

48:00.519 --> 48:01.840
Give him 1000 taels of silver.

48:01.840 --> 48:03.960
Tell him to make Mr. Song
go easy on a case.

48:04.440 --> 48:05.239
Guess how much

48:06.559 --> 48:07.880
he will embezzle them.

48:08.440 --> 48:10.280
I say 500 taels.

48:11.800 --> 48:13.480
These 200 taels are a deposit.

48:14.119 --> 48:15.400
The Guo family who runs the oil shop

48:15.679 --> 48:17.280
says that they'll pay more

48:17.599 --> 48:19.239
once we release their young master.

48:37.599 --> 48:38.440
Captain Yi.

48:39.480 --> 48:40.639
I heard

48:41.639 --> 48:42.920
that the young man

48:44.639 --> 48:46.559
had broken someone's legs.

48:47.239 --> 48:47.880
That's right.

48:48.320 --> 48:50.079
But he had a good reason.

48:50.639 --> 48:51.760
After all,

48:51.760 --> 48:55.000
the victim kicked
the young master's dog first.

49:05.639 --> 49:06.760
You're saying

49:09.039 --> 49:11.800
that 200 taels of silver
can buy a pair of legs.

49:15.599 --> 49:17.039
So it's too little?

49:17.480 --> 49:18.559
That's easy.

49:18.760 --> 49:19.480
Name a price.

49:19.719 --> 49:20.880
I'll work on it.

49:25.159 --> 49:26.159
Well...

49:26.760 --> 49:28.039
Why don't you name a price?

49:28.480 --> 49:30.599
I'd say 300 taels.

49:35.679 --> 49:36.960
Is it enough

49:38.480 --> 49:39.880
for you to live a free life?

49:40.079 --> 49:40.840
Mr. Song.

49:41.880 --> 49:43.119
What do you mean?

49:46.719 --> 49:47.519
Captain Yi.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.840
I heard that you've been
very busy ever since

49:51.840 --> 49:53.280
you took over the Hunter Squad.

49:54.559 --> 49:55.880
You threw the Two Rats and Three Wolves

49:56.039 --> 49:57.559
on the street naked.

49:58.280 --> 50:00.639
You're not getting any younger.

50:00.639 --> 50:01.800
Did you lose it

50:01.800 --> 50:04.440
because of the overwhelming work?

50:07.960 --> 50:09.800
Don't you know who I am?

50:11.800 --> 50:13.320
It's actually my fault.

50:13.840 --> 50:14.599
How about this?

50:16.039 --> 50:18.719
You're no longer
in charge of the Hunter Squad.

50:18.719 --> 50:19.840
I'll take over.

50:20.480 --> 50:21.519
Come on, Mr. Song.

50:21.880 --> 50:23.039
Please don't do that.

50:23.119 --> 50:25.920
Y-You can't fire me for that.

50:27.159 --> 50:28.480
If 300 taels are too little,

50:28.599 --> 50:29.960
then 500 taels.

50:32.199 --> 50:33.519
1000 taels will do, huh?

50:35.679 --> 50:36.719
Shame on you.

50:37.840 --> 50:38.440
Get lost.

50:51.280 --> 50:52.800
6000 taels in a year.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.119
18,000 taels in three years.

50:54.920 --> 50:56.159
30,000 taels in five years.

50:57.880 --> 50:58.719
All gone.

51:00.840 --> 51:01.360
All...

51:05.159 --> 51:06.159
Qu Sangeng?

51:06.519 --> 51:07.400
What do you want?

51:19.880 --> 51:22.320
I ran into Ms. Liu from Yingchun House.

51:25.280 --> 51:26.840
She said
you haven't visited for a long time.

51:27.559 --> 51:28.840
Yingchun House?

51:30.119 --> 51:31.400
What do you want?

51:32.320 --> 51:34.159
Mr. Song sent me to ask you

51:36.119 --> 51:38.800
whether you have paid
to keep that new girl

51:40.360 --> 51:41.800
all to yourself.

51:44.440 --> 51:45.800
Why would

51:46.199 --> 51:47.760
Mr. Song ask that?

51:49.039 --> 51:49.960
No idea.

51:49.960 --> 51:51.239
I don't think it's serious.

51:51.559 --> 51:53.199
Just answer the question.

51:55.719 --> 51:58.239
I did mention to Ms. Liu about

51:58.480 --> 51:59.760
paying for a month.

51:59.760 --> 52:00.639
How much did you pay?

52:00.960 --> 52:01.920
I just mentioned it.

52:01.920 --> 52:03.000
I didn't pay.

52:03.920 --> 52:06.679
You kept her to yourself without paying.

52:10.400 --> 52:12.199
That's really impressive.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.039
Ms. Liu complained that

52:16.480 --> 52:18.800
the new girl had been here
for almost two months

52:18.920 --> 52:20.039
but hadn't taken on

52:20.400 --> 52:21.960
other jobs because of you.

52:22.079 --> 52:23.039
Two months?

52:23.559 --> 52:24.440
That's nonsense.

52:25.039 --> 52:26.000
That new girl

52:26.800 --> 52:29.599
came on the eighth day of this month.

52:29.719 --> 52:30.800
It's not even a month yet.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.159
I went there

52:32.159 --> 52:33.719
the day she came.

52:33.920 --> 52:36.119
Why do you remember it so clearly?

52:36.599 --> 52:38.400
Mr. Zhang got transferred.

52:38.559 --> 52:41.360
We were supposed to
bid him farewell at Yingchun House

52:41.360 --> 52:43.199
with Captain Cui

52:43.440 --> 52:44.320
and some clerks.

52:44.719 --> 52:46.480
About eight or nine people.

52:46.920 --> 52:48.719
Why is Mr. Song asking that?

52:50.480 --> 52:51.960
He didn't tell me and I didn't ask.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.039
I'm guessing that

52:54.800 --> 52:56.599
he's also into that new girl.

52:59.519 --> 53:01.480
I don't think you should

53:02.440 --> 53:04.239
compete with him, Captain Yi.

53:07.719 --> 53:08.360
I won't.

53:09.440 --> 53:10.239
I dare not.

53:13.719 --> 53:15.199
So I'll tell Mr. Song that

53:15.199 --> 53:16.599
you didn't pay for the month.

53:24.320 --> 53:25.599
The testimonies match.

53:26.320 --> 53:27.119
Yeah.

53:28.559 --> 53:30.519
That was what Ms. Liu

53:30.519 --> 53:31.920
and the others said.

53:33.800 --> 53:35.639
He stayed at Yingchun House that day.

53:36.960 --> 53:39.280
Captain Leng was killed on that day.

53:40.039 --> 53:43.159
So he's clean.

53:44.840 --> 53:45.920
It looks like it

53:47.440 --> 53:48.320
for now.

53:54.119 --> 53:57.599
The Two Rats and Three Wolves
used to count on your master.

53:57.960 --> 53:59.719
Master was containing them.

54:00.440 --> 54:01.639
After your master died,

54:02.639 --> 54:04.159
they went to work for Captain Yi.

54:06.320 --> 54:07.719
I've heard of it.

54:07.880 --> 54:14.760
Who will they seek protection from
since I demoted Captain Yi today?

54:15.000 --> 54:16.440
I heard that the gangsters

54:16.960 --> 54:19.039
follow the lead of the judges

54:20.800 --> 54:21.679
in other Yamen.

54:25.079 --> 54:27.119
They did try to bribe me.

54:28.920 --> 54:30.159
I found them disgusting.

54:30.320 --> 54:33.360
But they could be useful sometimes.

54:37.840 --> 54:38.679
Qu Sangeng.

54:40.920 --> 54:42.199
You look clever.

54:42.599 --> 54:44.199
And I bet you've learned the tricks

54:44.199 --> 54:45.400
from your master.

54:46.880 --> 54:47.679
I have an idea.

54:48.679 --> 54:49.719
I'll support you.

54:50.760 --> 54:51.960
You'll lead them, okay?

54:56.519 --> 54:57.559
Qu Sangeng

54:57.920 --> 54:59.360
is nothing but a bailiff.

55:00.079 --> 55:01.519
I don't think he can protect us.

55:02.840 --> 55:04.760
We're not counting on him.

55:05.719 --> 55:06.400
We're just

55:06.400 --> 55:08.320
using him to take down Yi Youkao.

55:11.199 --> 55:14.800
So who's going to look after us?

55:15.880 --> 55:17.000
Mr. Song.

55:18.559 --> 55:19.440
Mr. Song?

55:20.199 --> 55:21.360
He doesn't accept money.

55:21.360 --> 55:25.079
Mr. Song is gloomy and dangerous.

55:25.559 --> 55:26.480
I bet he loves

55:26.719 --> 55:28.199
manipulating people.

55:31.440 --> 55:32.639
Be my right-hand man.

55:33.599 --> 55:35.800
And you'll decide what to do

55:37.880 --> 55:38.800
with the money.

55:39.400 --> 55:40.800
Speaking of which,

55:46.239 --> 55:47.519
I've kept a record.

56:01.639 --> 56:03.239
Who else have you shown it to?

56:04.679 --> 56:05.320
My Master

56:05.719 --> 56:06.360
and Captain Yi.

56:08.320 --> 56:09.679
I copied one for Captain Yi.

56:10.440 --> 56:11.239
No wonder.

56:11.800 --> 56:16.599
So you accept the offer?

56:16.599 --> 56:19.480
Mr. Song, I need you
to do me a favor first.

56:28.880 --> 56:31.719
The ledger is not just
a record of income,

56:32.760 --> 56:34.719
but also a record of sins.

56:36.199 --> 56:37.440
I'd like to ask you

56:37.440 --> 56:39.159
(Writ: warrant of arrest)
to issue a writ.

56:42.719 --> 56:45.159
I want to arrest
the Two Rats and Three Wolves

56:45.840 --> 56:48.119
and dissemble the gangs in Du County.

56:55.360 --> 56:57.280
How did you know I was testing you?

57:00.159 --> 57:01.960
I've been a bailiff for years,

57:02.800 --> 57:04.239
testing others all day.

57:07.760 --> 57:09.239
You're quite

57:09.960 --> 57:11.159
an interesting bailiff.

57:15.519 --> 57:17.280
Their leader looks tough.

57:20.239 --> 57:22.360
It will be pleasant for me

57:23.360 --> 57:24.159
to arrest him

57:25.679 --> 57:26.800
and interrogate him.

57:27.079 --> 57:28.599
So I have your permission?

57:34.840 --> 57:37.280
It's not easy to arrest those five men.

57:37.599 --> 57:39.480
If you catch one of them,

57:39.480 --> 57:40.679
the other four will run away.

57:41.159 --> 57:43.280
I'll just gather them
and arrest them all.

57:43.920 --> 57:46.280
They invited me over for a drink.

57:48.519 --> 57:49.800
What for?

57:51.360 --> 57:53.800
It was my idea to make Captain Yi

57:54.880 --> 57:56.039
bring you money.

58:01.000 --> 58:01.719
How dare you!

58:02.880 --> 58:04.039
You used me!

58:04.039 --> 58:04.800
Mr. Song.

58:05.639 --> 58:08.159
Didn't you just tell me
to be your right-hand man?

58:21.159 --> 58:21.800
Take it.

58:28.719 --> 58:29.599
I'll take my leave.

58:29.840 --> 58:30.360
Get lost.

58:35.440 --> 58:37.880
Is it not a delight to acquire knowledge

58:37.880 --> 58:39.920
and put it into practice
from time to time?

58:40.360 --> 58:41.679
Is it not a delight to have friends

58:41.679 --> 58:42.599
coming from afar?

58:42.880 --> 58:45.440
Is it not a delight to have friends

58:45.440 --> 58:47.400
coming from afar?

58:47.800 --> 58:48.199
A man...

58:48.199 --> 58:49.079
Sir.

58:49.599 --> 58:50.719
We've learned this.

58:52.519 --> 58:53.320
You have?

58:53.639 --> 58:54.239
We older ones

58:54.239 --> 58:56.440
have learned the Analects last year.

58:59.440 --> 59:00.400
Here is a quiz.

59:01.199 --> 59:02.320
Reviewing learned things...

59:02.320 --> 59:03.280
What's next?

59:06.119 --> 59:06.840
Huh?

59:06.840 --> 59:07.880
I thought you learned it.

59:09.360 --> 59:09.920
Sir.

59:09.920 --> 59:10.920
Reviewing learned things,

59:10.920 --> 59:11.800
you can be a teacher.

59:11.800 --> 59:13.000
It means that

59:13.000 --> 59:14.880
we can be teachers
if we review what we learn

59:14.880 --> 59:16.159
and know new things.

59:19.079 --> 59:20.000
As a teacher,

59:20.400 --> 59:21.519
shouldn't I remind you

59:21.519 --> 59:22.679
to review what you have learned?

59:25.159 --> 59:25.800
Keep going.

59:27.119 --> 59:28.639
A man of virtue feels no discomposure

59:28.840 --> 59:29.920
when men take no note of him.

59:30.400 --> 59:32.920
A man of virtue feels no discomposure

59:32.920 --> 59:35.239
when men take no note of him.

59:35.800 --> 59:36.679
Repeat.

59:36.880 --> 59:39.119
Is it not a delight to acquire knowledge

59:39.119 --> 59:41.199
and put it into practice
from time to time?

59:41.199 --> 59:44.039
Is it not a delight to have friends

59:44.039 --> 59:44.599
coming from afar?

59:44.599 --> 59:45.320
Stay after class.

59:46.360 --> 59:47.719
A man...

59:50.159 --> 59:52.679
Do you know why you got a detention?

59:57.320 --> 59:59.599
Mr. Wang also kept students, didn't he?

01:00:00.239 --> 01:00:02.840
He did it quite often,

01:00:03.039 --> 01:00:05.119
but not me.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.320
Who did he keep?

01:00:07.599 --> 01:00:08.440
There were a few.

01:00:10.159 --> 01:00:10.920
Write it down.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:12.880
All right.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.039
Do you know why you got a detention?

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:23.519
Yes, I do.

01:00:24.719 --> 01:00:25.480
You do?

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.000
Sir.

01:00:42.679 --> 01:00:43.679
Won't you kneel?

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.320
I... I will.

01:00:58.599 --> 01:00:59.320
Sir.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.079
Opposite.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.519
Turn around.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.239
Just...

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:05.960
Sir.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:06.559
No.

01:01:06.559 --> 01:01:07.199
Like this.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:08.639
Sir.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.239
What are you doing?

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.599
Sir.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.239
That's what
the detention is for, isn't it?

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:17.519
My uncle did that?

01:01:24.599 --> 01:01:26.079
He told me before.

01:01:27.119 --> 01:01:29.199
But it's been years and I forgot.

01:01:31.639 --> 01:01:32.679
Go on.

01:01:51.159 --> 01:01:51.800
Sir.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.239
Is it enough?

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.320
Enough, enough.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.079
Can I leave now?

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.920
Is there anything else?

01:02:08.239 --> 01:02:08.840
Sir.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:10.760
You want more?

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.800
No, no.

01:02:12.119 --> 01:02:13.400
I-If there's nothing else,

01:02:13.639 --> 01:02:14.400
we can stop.

01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:18.119
So I'll leave, sir.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.000
Oh right.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.039
Have you told anyone about it?

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.360
Never.

01:02:26.599 --> 01:02:27.440
Never.

01:02:27.599 --> 01:02:29.400
Not even my parents.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.280
Mr. Wang warned me that

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.559
I couldn't study here if I told someone.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:34.760
In that case,

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.920
my father would kill me.

01:02:38.239 --> 01:02:39.159
Who is your father?

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.679
He's an ironsmith in Liujiaji.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.519
Outside the West City Gate?

01:02:48.239 --> 01:02:49.239
Why did your father

01:02:49.239 --> 01:02:51.079
send you here to study

01:02:51.079 --> 01:02:52.480
instead of making you an ironsmith?

01:02:52.719 --> 01:02:53.719
I have many elder brothers.

01:02:54.119 --> 01:02:56.440
My father says that
someone has to be educated.

01:02:56.679 --> 01:02:58.800
And Mr. Wang didn't charge me.

01:03:05.119 --> 01:03:06.079
Goodbye.

01:03:12.159 --> 01:03:12.960
Goodbye.

01:03:16.199 --> 01:03:16.840
Don't move.

01:03:21.199 --> 01:03:22.559
That kid did this to you?

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.719
What a beating.

01:03:27.119 --> 01:03:29.119
That kid can be a great Yamen runner.

01:03:40.199 --> 01:03:41.119
When you told me

01:03:41.559 --> 01:03:43.519
that the murderer
stuffed a headless chick

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:45.000
in my uncle's mouth,

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:46.559
I thought...

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.159
I wanted to
get some clues from those kids

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:54.559
but ended up...

01:03:54.639 --> 01:03:57.679
Discovering some weird fetish.

01:04:00.519 --> 01:04:01.880
I checked my uncle's account books.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.119
Every year,

01:04:03.599 --> 01:04:04.519
he took in

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.320
three students without a fee.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.440
They were all poor kids

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.400
living outside the city.

01:04:11.199 --> 01:04:12.519
It was easy to silence them,

01:04:12.639 --> 01:04:14.000
and even if others found out,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.199
he could just send them home.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.800
Nobody would know in the city.

01:04:18.679 --> 01:04:19.400
Besides,

01:04:19.679 --> 01:04:22.039
imagine a kid telling his father
who's an ironsmith,

01:04:22.199 --> 01:04:25.320
"My teacher is making me
beat him up with a ferule."

01:04:26.559 --> 01:04:28.280
The ironsmith may think he's crazy

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.800
and beat him up.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.599
I used to think that

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.719
I had known my uncle my whole life.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.400
But after he passed away, I realized

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.280
that I never knew the real him.

01:04:46.159 --> 01:04:47.840
You think you know him well

01:04:50.199 --> 01:04:52.440
but you turn out to be strangers.

01:04:56.199 --> 01:04:57.960
To my uncle.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.280
To Mr. Wang.

01:05:13.119 --> 01:05:13.800
This is

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:17.679
to my master.

01:05:20.559 --> 01:05:21.960
To Captain Leng.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:34.880
This is...

01:05:37.519 --> 01:05:38.400
This is to...

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.320
To whom?

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.599
To Confucius.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:52.719
To Confucius?

01:05:53.519 --> 01:05:56.079
He's been teaching people
morality for centuries in vain.

01:05:57.239 --> 01:05:58.159
In the end,

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.000
the world is still filled with animals

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.320
who don't talk,

01:06:02.519 --> 01:06:04.559
think, or behave like humans.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.599
Confucius,

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.400
please don't be mad.

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:10.960
Don't see it as your failure.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.760
It's just...

01:06:12.679 --> 01:06:14.159
It's just so hard

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.039
to be a decent man.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.119
It's so hard.

01:06:18.079 --> 01:06:19.760
Well said. It's hard indeed.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.320
Bottoms up.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:21.880
Bottoms up.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.599
My head hurts so much.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.559
Have some soup and you'll be fine.

01:06:58.559 --> 01:06:59.159
Really?

01:06:59.559 --> 01:07:00.199
Where?

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.440
Over there.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.800
Fish soup with tofu
at the pancake stall is the best.

01:07:04.119 --> 01:07:05.079
Cross the bridge.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.599
It's right in that...

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.719
In that alley...

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.400
Standing by the river, the Master

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.719
said, "Time passes by like this."

01:07:21.159 --> 01:07:22.639
Standing by the river, the Master...

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.199
Could it be the gambler
who drowned himself, the owner

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:32.199
(Time passes by like this)
of that mansion in Yanzhi Alley, Chen Wang?

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:35.239
This case surely

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.159
has something to do
with the fire 20 years ago.

01:07:44.812 --> 01:07:46.604
