00:00.211 --> 00:02.911
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.295 --> 00:06.830
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:06.897 --> 00:09.265
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.333 --> 00:14.137
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:14.205 --> 00:16.338
- <i>Where am I?</i>
- <i>Miami.</i>

00:16.407 --> 00:19.509
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.577 --> 00:22.145
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.213 --> 00:23.747
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:23.814 --> 00:25.382
Should we shoot them?

00:25.449 --> 00:27.984
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.052 --> 00:30.353
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.421 --> 00:32.822
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:32.890 --> 00:35.058
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.126 --> 00:37.560
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:37.628 --> 00:39.229
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:45.090 --> 00:47.391
Mr. Westen, we're aware
of your past affiliation

00:47.459 --> 00:49.960
with a rogue network
of burned spies.

00:50.028 --> 00:50.941
To the best
of your knowledge,

00:50.966 --> 00:53.027
does any trace of that network
still exist.

00:53.398 --> 00:54.598
No.

00:56.368 --> 00:58.536
All of that's over now.

01:00.338 --> 01:01.438
Who the hell are you?

01:01.506 --> 01:02.873
I'm the one
who watched you tear down

01:02.941 --> 01:05.910
every last shred of the
organization that burned you.

01:05.977 --> 01:07.912
The organization I spent
half my life building.

01:10.081 --> 01:11.348
I framed you,

01:11.416 --> 01:13.083
and now I'm framing
your girlfriend for murder.

01:13.151 --> 01:14.451
I own you.

01:14.519 --> 01:16.387
I don't want you doing anything
for that man.

01:16.454 --> 01:17.888
I don't have a choice, Fi,

01:17.956 --> 01:19.223
unless we find some leverage
of our own.

01:19.291 --> 01:20.457
Michael, listen to me.

01:20.525 --> 01:22.426
There's no moves left
on the chess board.

01:22.494 --> 01:23.761
I know you.

01:23.828 --> 01:25.696
About five years ago,
I filled in

01:25.764 --> 01:27.531
as a substitute
for Madeline's therapist.

01:27.599 --> 01:28.933
She didn't know
who she was talking to.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.835
It's your father
you <i>should</i> be upset with.

01:31.903 --> 01:34.071
The things <i>that</i> man gave us
before he passed away...

01:34.139 --> 01:36.640
Anson's using that dish
to talk to someone.

01:36.708 --> 01:38.409
So, Anson
was calling here?

01:38.476 --> 01:40.411
- Wait a second. Is that...
- Benny.

01:40.478 --> 01:42.246
As in, your mother's
boyfriend, Benny.

01:45.317 --> 01:46.850
Ma,
you don't have to do this.

01:46.918 --> 01:47.952
I don't care
how long it takes.

01:48.019 --> 01:49.787
I want to know
if it was all a lie.

01:49.854 --> 01:51.388
Did you get
the package I sent you?

01:51.456 --> 01:52.389
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>I got the package.</i>

01:52.457 --> 01:53.757
Package?

02:00.999 --> 02:03.434
<i>When a spy is killed</i>
<i>in the field,</i>

02:03.501 --> 02:06.437
<i>it's often hardest on the</i>
<i>people they were spying on.</i>

02:06.504 --> 02:07.771
It's about Benny.

02:07.839 --> 02:09.872
Anson is using him
to spy on us.

02:09.941 --> 02:12.076
<i>Mourning the death of someone</i>
<i>you thought you knew</i>

02:12.143 --> 02:13.677
<i>is complicated enough</i>

02:13.745 --> 02:15.913
<i>when the spy was</i>
<i>a trusted colleague or friend.</i>

02:15.981 --> 02:17.748
I thought
he had feelings for me.

02:17.816 --> 02:19.550
<i>But it's even more difficult</i>

02:19.618 --> 02:21.485
<i>when they were someone</i>
<i>you loved.</i>

02:34.232 --> 02:35.432
Hi, mom.

02:37.335 --> 02:40.437
I'm sorry I didn't make it
to the funeral.

02:41.606 --> 02:43.874
How you holding up?

02:43.942 --> 02:46.844
Honestly?

02:46.911 --> 02:48.345
I don't know.

02:48.413 --> 02:51.015
I feel like
I should be glad

02:51.082 --> 02:54.151
that a man who was spying on me
is gone.

02:56.388 --> 02:57.955
But I don't.

02:58.023 --> 03:02.459
It felt like he knew me in a way
that no one else did.

03:02.527 --> 03:03.927
We liked the same songs.

03:03.995 --> 03:06.563
And he'd take me places
I always wanted to go, and...

03:08.533 --> 03:10.668
I know it sounds crazy,

03:10.735 --> 03:14.238
but I honestly thought that
we were made for each other.

03:15.607 --> 03:18.876
Benny knew you, but not because
he was your soul mate.

03:20.278 --> 03:22.379
What are you
talking about?

03:22.447 --> 03:25.115
Six years ago, your therapist
went on sabbatical.

03:26.785 --> 03:28.819
W-what does that
have to do with Benny?

03:28.887 --> 03:32.723
Your substitute therapist
was Anson Fullerton.

03:32.791 --> 03:34.858
He arranged sessions
with you

03:34.926 --> 03:36.560
so he could find out
background information on me.

03:36.628 --> 03:38.629
He was preparing
to burn me.

03:38.697 --> 03:39.863
He hired Benny.

03:39.931 --> 03:42.266
He gave him all the information
he would need

03:42.334 --> 03:44.501
to make sure
that you two hit it off.

03:44.569 --> 03:47.905
All so that he could
keep tabs on <i>me.</i>

03:47.972 --> 03:50.274
How long have you known
about this?

03:50.342 --> 03:54.178
Ever since I met Anson.

03:57.015 --> 04:00.084
And you said nothing?

04:00.151 --> 04:01.318
I didn't want you
to get hurt.

04:03.521 --> 04:05.422
Get out.

04:06.991 --> 04:09.126
You had no right
to keep that from me!

04:12.397 --> 04:14.231
Get the hell
out of my house.

04:14.299 --> 04:15.632
Get out!

04:31.082 --> 04:33.317
Finger on the housing,
not the trigger, Fi.

04:33.385 --> 04:36.320
Anson had no problem killing
Madeline's boyfriend.

04:36.388 --> 04:38.055
Who's to say
he'll stop there?

04:38.123 --> 04:39.890
Look, trust me, I wouldn't
put anything past the guy,

04:39.958 --> 04:42.259
but I don't think he wants to
break his new toy just yet.

04:42.327 --> 04:43.627
He still has plans
for Mike,

04:43.695 --> 04:45.796
so can we please focus
on keeping your boyfriend safe?

04:45.864 --> 04:47.531
Here he comes now.

04:53.171 --> 04:54.538
Hello, Michael.

04:54.606 --> 04:55.873
I know it's been
a big week,

04:55.940 --> 04:58.842
but rest assured,
nothing's changed between us.

04:58.910 --> 05:00.411
You sent a man
to spy on my mother.

05:00.478 --> 05:02.112
And when I found out,
you had him killed.

05:02.180 --> 05:03.781
I think
things have changed.

05:03.848 --> 05:04.782
<i>I</i> killed him?

05:04.849 --> 05:06.483
Michael. Come on.

05:06.551 --> 05:09.219
You knew Benny was dead the minute
you tried to use him against me.

05:09.287 --> 05:11.622
You want to pretend
that's not true, go ahead.

05:11.689 --> 05:13.724
But don't blame me.

05:13.792 --> 05:14.958
What do you want?

05:15.026 --> 05:16.360
My money.

05:16.428 --> 05:17.761
Your little investigation
into me

05:17.829 --> 05:19.363
got a certain
Cayman Islands account

05:19.431 --> 05:21.031
flagged
by U.S. intelligence.

05:21.099 --> 05:22.766
It's too risky
to wire the money,

05:22.834 --> 05:24.935
so I need somebody
to go there in person.

05:25.003 --> 05:28.071
I can't fly to the Caymans.
CIA tracks my travel.

05:28.139 --> 05:30.741
Well, that's what
friends are for.

05:30.809 --> 05:33.177
They're here somewhere,
right?

05:33.244 --> 05:36.547
Nestled in some little sniper
perch with a clear view of us?

05:36.614 --> 05:37.881
If they're willing
to shoot me for you,

05:37.949 --> 05:39.917
I imagine they'll fly
to the Caribbean

05:39.984 --> 05:42.085
and blackmail a banker.
The job shouldn't be too hard.

05:42.153 --> 05:44.588
I tend to work with people
who are easy to manipulate.

05:44.656 --> 05:47.157
So check out the skeletons
in this guy's closet

05:47.225 --> 05:49.193
and call me
when my money's stateside.

05:53.765 --> 05:55.933
I won't be told what to do
forever.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.734
I need to know this ends.

05:57.802 --> 05:59.870
You're done by the end
of the month, Michael.

05:59.938 --> 06:01.205
I promise.

06:01.272 --> 06:03.807
In the meantime, remember,
actions have consequences.

06:03.875 --> 06:07.077
Just ask your mother.

06:26.997 --> 06:29.932
Hey, guys.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.634
Mike, you okay?

06:32.003 --> 06:34.038
Hey, your mom's a tough lady.
She's gonna be fine.

06:35.057 --> 06:37.656
So, listen, I've been checking into
this Cayman Islands business

06:37.657 --> 06:38.678
that Anson wants us to do.

06:38.679 --> 06:41.145
I think I got an angle
we can use. I made some calls.

06:41.394 --> 06:43.729
You know we can't
go to the cops, Sam,

06:43.796 --> 06:46.465
unless you want Anson to drop a
ton of bricks directly on my head.

06:46.532 --> 06:47.666
I'm not talking
about the cops.

06:47.734 --> 06:49.234
I'm talking about
going to the FBI,

06:49.302 --> 06:51.570
high enough so we can sort out
your blackmail problem.

06:51.637 --> 06:53.005
I mean, I'm gonna have to
call in a lot of favors --

06:53.072 --> 06:54.740
it's probably
the only play we have.

06:54.807 --> 06:56.608
But we still have to
go get Anson's money.

06:56.676 --> 06:58.477
Fi, do you think
you can convince Jesse

06:58.544 --> 07:00.479
to back you up on a trip
to the Cayman Islands?

07:00.546 --> 07:03.348
Sure.

07:03.416 --> 07:06.618
<i>The Cayman Islands are home</i>
<i>to only 60,000 people,</i>

07:06.686 --> 07:08.520
<i>but thanks to lenient tax laws,</i>

07:08.588 --> 07:11.523
<i>it's the fifth-largest</i>
<i>financial center in the world,</i>

07:11.591 --> 07:14.226
<i>but it's not banking</i>
<i>like most people are used to.</i>

07:14.293 --> 07:16.661
<i>Bank locations</i>
<i>tend to not offer services</i>

07:16.729 --> 07:19.431
<i>like online bill pay,</i>
<i>drive-through teller windows,</i>

07:19.499 --> 07:20.899
<i>or even ATMs.</i>

07:20.967 --> 07:23.035
<i>What they lack</i>
<i>in modern conveniences</i>

07:23.102 --> 07:25.070
<i>they make up for</i>
<i>in guaranteeing their clients</i>

07:25.138 --> 07:27.272
<i>complete security</i>
<i>and anonymity.</i>

07:27.340 --> 07:28.974
<i>Whether you're</i>
<i>a Wall Street executive</i>

07:29.042 --> 07:30.509
<i>looking for a tax shelter</i>

07:30.576 --> 07:33.445
<i>or an international criminal</i>
<i>hiding a small fortune,</i>

07:33.513 --> 07:34.946
<i>it's nearly impossible</i>

07:35.014 --> 07:37.349
<i>for government agencies</i>
<i>to access your information</i>

07:37.417 --> 07:39.584
<i>when your bank of choice</i>
<i>is nothing more</i>

07:39.652 --> 07:42.521
<i>than a number in a phone book,</i>
<i>a sign on a window,</i>

07:42.588 --> 07:46.258
<i>and a sleazy banker</i>
<i>with very white teeth.</i>

07:46.325 --> 07:48.660
You read Anson's file
on this dude?

07:48.728 --> 07:50.395
He hides money
for everyone --

07:50.463 --> 07:52.264
terrorist groups,
arms traffickers, warlords.

07:52.331 --> 07:54.266
I feel like I need
a shower just looking at him.

07:54.333 --> 07:55.734
Let's get this over with.

07:55.802 --> 07:57.269
Fi, Fi, whoa --
we trying to get this guy

07:57.336 --> 07:59.237
to transfer a couple hundred
million off the books.

07:59.305 --> 08:02.207
You think the move is to just
blackmail him in the street?

08:02.275 --> 08:03.642
Of course not.

08:03.709 --> 08:05.777
I'm just gonna invite him
to lunch.

08:09.982 --> 08:11.149
Uh, Mr. Anders,
a moment?

08:11.217 --> 08:13.819
Banking hours are over.

08:13.886 --> 08:15.821
Sir, I promise this will
be worth your while.

08:15.888 --> 08:17.789
We heard you're the best.
My wife's father's dying.

08:17.857 --> 08:20.625
That's very sad.
I have a meeting.

08:20.693 --> 08:21.993
- Mr. Anders!
- Yes?

08:22.061 --> 08:23.795
We did not charter a private jet
from the Hamptons

08:23.863 --> 08:25.363
to waste your time.

08:25.431 --> 08:27.766
Listen,
we have a very...

08:27.834 --> 08:29.701
<i>very</i> large sum of money
that we need to move

08:29.769 --> 08:31.269
before her old man
kicks the bucket

08:31.337 --> 08:32.736
and his company's board
checks the books.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.706
We're talking
a $200 million estate.

08:34.774 --> 08:36.808
- Now, if you're not interested...
- No. No.

08:36.876 --> 08:38.110
I apologize
for being brusque.

08:38.177 --> 08:40.812
I-I don't get
many walk-in clients.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.414
Oh,
that's understandable.

08:42.482 --> 08:44.149
Let's start over.

08:44.217 --> 08:45.784
How about we take you
to lunch tomorrow?

08:45.852 --> 08:47.085
How does 1:00 p.m.
sound?

08:47.153 --> 08:48.520
Excellent.
Meet me here.

08:48.588 --> 08:50.755
Bring your account information.
I'll look it over.

08:50.823 --> 08:53.725
I'll take care of any funds
you wish to deposit.

08:53.793 --> 08:55.160
Okay?
See you tomorrow.

08:55.228 --> 08:57.562
Okay. Now Sam's
got to do his part.

09:05.171 --> 09:06.538
<i>When you want to catch</i>

09:06.606 --> 09:08.406
<i>a well-placed</i>
<i>and well-protected spy,</i>

09:08.474 --> 09:10.408
<i>you can't just call</i>
<i>local police.</i>

09:10.476 --> 09:13.345
<i>That kind of investigation</i>
<i>takes high-level resources</i>

09:13.412 --> 09:15.780
<i>and an even higher level</i>
<i>of operational secrecy,</i>

09:15.848 --> 09:17.215
<i>which means you have to start</i>

09:17.283 --> 09:19.317
<i>with someone connected</i>
<i>to the very top.</i>

09:19.385 --> 09:21.319
A meeting with
the deputy director, huh?

09:23.422 --> 09:25.223
Big favor, Axe.

09:25.291 --> 09:28.026
I guess that explains why
you bought me an $18 scotch.

09:28.094 --> 09:29.494
Come on.
It's a couple of calls.

09:29.562 --> 09:30.996
You got friends
in the D.C. office.

09:31.063 --> 09:32.297
And I'd like to keep them.

09:32.365 --> 09:33.365
Look, my friends
are in a tight spot.

09:33.432 --> 09:34.766
Spare me the details,
all right?

09:34.834 --> 09:36.168
I'll set it up,

09:36.235 --> 09:38.170
but I don't want to get any more
involved than I have to.

09:38.237 --> 09:40.172
Fair enough.
Thanks, Harris.

09:40.239 --> 09:41.439
And if this thing
blows back on me,

09:41.507 --> 09:43.041
there won't be enough scotch
in the world

09:43.109 --> 09:44.743
to keep me off your ass.

09:44.810 --> 09:46.211
Loud and clear.

09:49.749 --> 09:52.083
Excuse me. Sam? There's
a young woman asking for you.

09:52.151 --> 09:54.719
I told her she'd have to wait
until your meeting was over.

09:54.787 --> 09:55.854
<i>Ibarbilla!</i>
<i>Beatriz?!</i>

09:55.922 --> 09:58.456
Oh! Wow!
Is it great to see you!

10:00.793 --> 10:02.260
What's it been --
like five years?

10:02.328 --> 10:03.929
What are you doing here?

10:03.996 --> 10:06.331
Looking for you.
I've been all over the city.

10:06.399 --> 10:07.432
And nobody knew
where you lived.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.633
Well, you found me.
Sit down.

10:08.701 --> 10:09.968
So, what brings you
to Miami?

10:10.036 --> 10:11.903
You come all the way from Bogotá
for a social visit?

10:11.971 --> 10:14.339
I came because
I need your help.

10:14.407 --> 10:15.740
Okay, we'll get some dinner,
you can fill me in,

10:15.808 --> 10:16.675
we'll catch up
on old times.

10:16.742 --> 10:19.344
Sam, this is serious.

10:19.412 --> 10:21.379
Someone's trying to kill me.

10:23.683 --> 10:26.952
Okay, so,
you wrote all these?

10:27.019 --> 10:29.087
For the newspaper,
yes.

10:29.155 --> 10:31.256
And you think something
in one of these articles

10:31.324 --> 10:32.791
made someone
want to kill you?

10:32.858 --> 10:34.326
Not think.
I <i>know</i> it!

10:34.393 --> 10:36.494
Okay.
But this is in Russian.

10:36.562 --> 10:37.963
Since when
do you speak Russian?

10:41.133 --> 10:45.503
Okay. So, what do you want me
to do, exactly?

10:45.571 --> 10:47.973
You know people
with the government.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.207
You can call them.

10:49.275 --> 10:50.809
And say what?

10:50.876 --> 10:53.111
You know,
here's 50 pages of research,

10:53.179 --> 10:55.714
a bunch of articles on
Colombian/Russian oil contracts.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.048
It's complicated stuff.

10:57.116 --> 10:58.984
Complicated?

10:59.051 --> 11:00.719
This is simple.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.187
I print this,

11:02.255 --> 11:03.989
and the next day
they try to shoot me.

11:04.056 --> 11:06.124
I got a call...

11:06.192 --> 11:09.894
from a man I didn't know.

11:09.962 --> 11:12.063
I was busy,

11:12.131 --> 11:14.032
so I told my assistant
to take the call.

11:14.100 --> 11:17.369
She was there at my desk

11:17.436 --> 11:19.404
when the bullet
came through the window.

11:19.472 --> 11:22.274
Now she's in the hospital.

11:22.341 --> 11:23.441
On life support.

11:25.177 --> 11:27.545
Christ, kid.

11:27.613 --> 11:30.015
Yeah, sounds like somebody
set you up for sure.

11:30.082 --> 11:31.249
Do you know who this guy is,
the guy who's after you?

11:31.317 --> 11:32.851
You got nothing?

11:32.918 --> 11:35.487
Nothing.

11:35.554 --> 11:38.056
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't know who else to ask.

11:38.124 --> 11:39.858
It's okay. You came to the right
place. We'll sort this out.

11:39.925 --> 11:43.028
First thing we got to do is find
out who this son of a bitch is.

11:43.095 --> 11:45.297
Chances are he's still
trying to track you down.

11:45.364 --> 11:46.698
Okay, get your stuff.

11:46.766 --> 11:48.667
Let's get you
someplace safe,

11:48.734 --> 11:51.403
hopefully someplace that
doesn't smell like wet socks.

12:03.049 --> 12:05.283
Something's wrong.

12:06.719 --> 12:07.419
Gun! Move!

12:11.023 --> 12:13.058
Looks like the bastard who's been
after you followed you to Miami.

12:13.125 --> 12:15.327
We got to get to that car.

12:18.297 --> 12:21.800
We're not gonna make it!
<i>Mira.</i>

12:21.867 --> 12:22.834
<i>Surviving</i>
<i>an enemy sniper attack</i>

12:22.902 --> 12:25.103
<i>is about finding adequate cover</i>

12:25.171 --> 12:26.571
<i>while being able</i>
<i>to stay mobile enough</i>

12:26.639 --> 12:29.541
<i>to escape the shooter's</i>
<i>pre-scouted kill zone.</i>

12:29.608 --> 12:32.344
<i>Pulling the shifter linkage</i>
<i>of a parked car into neutral</i>

12:32.411 --> 12:34.079
<i>and using it</i>
<i>as a rolling barricade</i>

12:34.146 --> 12:35.547
<i>allows you to do both...</i>

12:35.614 --> 12:38.550
Stay behind the car. Okay?
Ready? Push, push, push!

12:38.617 --> 12:40.151
<i>...As long as you can</i>
<i>get it moving.</i>

12:47.360 --> 12:49.627
He's reloading.
Let's move!

12:49.695 --> 12:52.330
Okay, let's go!

12:56.335 --> 12:58.136
You okay? Are you hit?
I'm fine.

12:58.204 --> 12:59.637
Go! Go!

13:10.601 --> 13:11.644
So, Mike,
what you think?

13:11.645 --> 13:13.913
I mean, you know these eastern
bloc types better than me.

13:13.980 --> 13:15.915
It's been a long time,
and I didn't know any operatives

13:15.982 --> 13:17.483
who worked
in Latin America.

13:17.551 --> 13:19.785
You know, you blew the whistle
on a lot of powerful people.

13:19.853 --> 13:21.587
Any one of them
can be after you.

13:21.655 --> 13:23.322
You're sure
you have no idea?

13:23.390 --> 13:26.859
I already told you.
I don't know.

13:26.927 --> 13:28.360
We know
the guy was trained.

13:28.428 --> 13:29.628
And the hardware
he was using was serious.

13:29.696 --> 13:30.996
Probably Russian FSB

13:31.064 --> 13:32.932
but that doesn't
narrow it down much.

13:32.999 --> 13:36.368
Mike, uh...
This may sound crazy,

13:36.436 --> 13:38.070
but we know a shrink
whose job it is

13:38.138 --> 13:41.607
to profile and identify agents
like this.

13:41.675 --> 13:43.842
You want to bring <i>Anson</i> in
on this?

13:43.910 --> 13:45.878
We got to find this guy
before he takes another shot.

13:45.946 --> 13:47.813
Anson's our best bet
at I.D.'ing him.

13:47.881 --> 13:50.916
Anson's killed at least four
people since we've met him.

13:50.984 --> 13:53.719
Are you sure you want to
ask <i>him</i> for help?

13:53.787 --> 13:55.020
Mike, I don't like this,
either,

13:55.088 --> 13:56.889
but the kid means
a lot to me, okay?

13:56.957 --> 13:59.491
She saved my life more than once
when I was down in Colombia.

13:59.559 --> 14:02.194
So if she comes to me for help,
I'm damn well gonna do it.

14:12.138 --> 14:14.673
<i>As a spy,</i>
<i>you get used to the idea</i>

14:14.741 --> 14:16.442
<i>that you sometimes have to</i>
<i>ask your enemies for help.</i>

14:16.509 --> 14:18.978
<i>It's not an easy thing to do,</i>

14:19.045 --> 14:21.146
<i>but unfortunately</i>
<i>the best information</i>

14:21.214 --> 14:22.881
<i>is often in the hands</i>
<i>the worst people.</i>

14:22.949 --> 14:27.419
So, you want me to help you find
a Russian spy?

14:27.487 --> 14:28.754
Michael,
I think you're confused

14:28.822 --> 14:30.322
about the nature
of our relationship.

14:30.390 --> 14:32.124
<i>You</i> work for <i>me.</i>

14:32.192 --> 14:33.359
And I've done
what you've asked.

14:33.426 --> 14:35.494
Now I'm <i>asking</i>
<i>for something in return.</i>

14:35.562 --> 14:37.296
What you get in return is
your girlfriend's freedom.

14:37.364 --> 14:39.064
Now, don't call me again
until you have my money.

14:39.132 --> 14:41.267
Before you go, I want you
to think about something.

14:41.334 --> 14:42.801
You've seen
my psych profile.

14:42.869 --> 14:45.104
- I helped <i>write</i> your psych profile.
- <i>Good.</i>

14:45.171 --> 14:48.507
Then you know that if my friends
are in danger -- real danger --

14:48.575 --> 14:50.909
I will help them,
whatever the risks.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.311
What's the point?

14:52.379 --> 14:55.014
My point is I'm no good to you
dead or in jail.

14:55.081 --> 14:57.650
So you help me,
and it's a lot more likely

14:57.717 --> 15:00.919
I will stay healthy, free,
and useful to you.

15:02.522 --> 15:04.156
Fine. I'll help.

15:04.224 --> 15:05.591
But here's what
it's gonna cost you.

15:05.659 --> 15:08.761
I get to come along
and watch you work, every step.

15:12.966 --> 15:15.200
Deal.

15:15.268 --> 15:17.169
I'll be in touch.

15:17.237 --> 15:19.738
And tell Fi and Jesse
my bank account is still empty.

15:25.612 --> 15:29.381
I must apologize again
for before.

15:29.449 --> 15:32.384
People don't always understand
the, uh, high-dollar-amount,

15:32.452 --> 15:35.254
discreet financial service
we arrange.

15:35.322 --> 15:38.090
I assure you we understand
<i>exactly</i> what you do.

15:38.158 --> 15:40.192
Well, let's get right to it,
then, shall we?

15:40.260 --> 15:41.860
How can I help you?

15:41.928 --> 15:43.329
Well, here's the deal,
George.

15:43.396 --> 15:45.164
There's been a bit
of a change of plans.

15:45.231 --> 15:46.799
We don't need you
to make a deposit.

15:46.866 --> 15:51.637
We need you to make a withdrawal
from this account.

15:55.608 --> 15:58.077
That's impossible.
This is a flagged account.

15:58.144 --> 15:59.611
They'll know the moment
the money's touched.

15:59.679 --> 16:00.779
Now, unless
there's something else,

16:00.847 --> 16:01.947
I'd say
this meeting is over.

16:02.015 --> 16:03.449
Well, there <i>is</i>
<i>something else.</i>

16:05.118 --> 16:06.852
Take a look at this.

16:11.124 --> 16:13.592
These are my confidential
client accounts.

16:13.660 --> 16:15.994
- How on earth did you get this?!
- Doesn't matter how we got it.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.831
All that matters
is what we can do <i>with</i> it.

16:18.898 --> 16:21.633
You really think I'm gonna
sit here and let this happen?

16:21.701 --> 16:22.735
Let you
blackmail me?

16:22.802 --> 16:24.970
Um...Yeah.

16:25.038 --> 16:26.438
It's actually pretty simple,
George.

16:26.506 --> 16:28.707
If you don't get us the money
that we're asking for,

16:28.775 --> 16:31.243
well, all these dangerous
clients of yours are gonna

16:31.311 --> 16:33.512
find out that you haven't been
so discreet after all.

16:33.580 --> 16:36.648
Sharing their financial info
would be quite a deal breaker.

16:36.716 --> 16:40.319
My clients know
that I would never --

16:40.387 --> 16:41.453
okay,
who should we call first --

16:41.521 --> 16:42.821
the drug dealers
or the terrorists?

16:42.889 --> 16:45.090
Druggies are closer.
That's true. That's true.

16:45.158 --> 16:46.859
But the terrorists are a little quicker
on the trigger, don't you think?

16:46.860 --> 16:47.502
Uh-huh.

16:47.503 --> 16:48.494
Yeah, what's the country
code for Algeria?

16:48.495 --> 16:49.561
George, do you know --

16:49.629 --> 16:50.462
okay, okay, okay.
Look. Fine.

16:50.530 --> 16:51.730
I'll get the money.

16:51.798 --> 16:53.866
Meet me at the, uh,
old church grounds.

16:53.933 --> 16:55.434
St. Anthony's.
Tomorrow at noon.

16:55.502 --> 16:56.835
Thank you, George.

16:56.903 --> 16:58.470
I would insist
that you stay for lunch,

16:58.538 --> 16:59.772
but you have work to do.

16:59.839 --> 17:01.507
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

17:11.151 --> 17:14.153
There you are, Michael.

17:14.220 --> 17:15.820
I must admit,
I'm warming to the notion

17:15.888 --> 17:17.089
of you coming to me
for help.

17:17.156 --> 17:18.390
I think
it'll be good for us.

17:18.458 --> 17:20.726
You said you had something
on who's after Beatriz.

17:20.794 --> 17:23.194
I went back to the office
and worked up a profile,

17:23.262 --> 17:26.131
uh, based on involvement
in the oil industry,

17:26.199 --> 17:27.566
assignments into Colombia,

17:27.634 --> 17:29.401
and, of course,
skill with a sniper rifle.

17:29.469 --> 17:30.335
Any good candidates?

17:32.238 --> 17:35.974
Beatriz's article referenced
a man named Oscar aguirre.

17:36.042 --> 17:37.609
Real name --
Oscar Markov.

17:37.677 --> 17:39.845
He wasn't supposed to be
at that energy conference.

17:39.913 --> 17:41.914
She outed a spy.

17:41.981 --> 17:44.850
And now that his cover's blown,
his number-one priority

17:44.918 --> 17:47.352
is to silence
his pretty little publicist.

17:47.420 --> 17:49.755
Question is,
what will his next move be?

17:49.823 --> 17:51.790
The FSB likes
to plant spies

17:51.858 --> 17:54.193
in big corporations
on foreign soil.

17:54.260 --> 17:55.894
He'd be looking
to reconnect.

17:55.962 --> 17:57.429
Exactly.

17:57.497 --> 17:59.731
So I went a step further,
located Russian intelligence's

17:59.799 --> 18:02.100
favorite corporate headquarters
here in Miami.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.769
And?

18:03.837 --> 18:05.404
The information's
not free.

18:05.472 --> 18:07.272
You already
agreed to help.

18:07.340 --> 18:09.408
I agreed to I.D. Oscar.
Job done.

18:09.476 --> 18:10.676
If you want to know
where he is,

18:10.743 --> 18:12.678
I want unfettered access
to that brain of yours.

18:12.745 --> 18:15.180
I get to ask the questions,
and you have to answer them.

18:15.248 --> 18:16.648
I don't have time
to play these games.

18:16.716 --> 18:18.484
No, you don't.

18:18.551 --> 18:19.818
But I do.

18:19.886 --> 18:21.887
Fine.

18:21.955 --> 18:25.090
Ask me whatever you'd like.
But just tell me where he is.

18:25.158 --> 18:27.793
Oscar made an appointment
at Dyban Industries.

18:27.861 --> 18:29.828
It's a Russian energy firm
on Miami Beach.

18:29.896 --> 18:31.230
Probably
on his way there now.

18:43.710 --> 18:45.344
Well,
where do you start?

18:45.411 --> 18:48.447
Her. The blonde
at the front desk.

18:48.515 --> 18:51.517
She sees everyone that comes
and goes through this lobby.

18:51.584 --> 18:53.018
And she won't have
the clearances

18:53.086 --> 18:54.686
to know who's working
with the FSB.

18:54.754 --> 18:56.655
If we play it right,
she can give us full access

18:56.723 --> 18:58.490
to the building.

18:58.558 --> 19:00.826
Let me ask you something.

19:00.894 --> 19:02.427
What do you think
happens to her

19:02.495 --> 19:03.795
after you talk
your way in?

19:03.863 --> 19:06.098
This job is probably
all that she has.

19:06.165 --> 19:08.367
How do you justify that
to yourself?

19:09.836 --> 19:11.370
Unfettered access,
remember?

19:13.473 --> 19:16.542
Better she finds a new job
than Sam buries a friend.

19:18.511 --> 19:19.745
Hello.

19:19.812 --> 19:21.113
Hi.

19:21.180 --> 19:22.447
Good afternoon.
How can I help you?

19:22.515 --> 19:24.983
Uh, I have a meeting
with Oscar Markov.

19:25.051 --> 19:26.985
My name
is Dmitri Malkin.

19:27.053 --> 19:28.520
I believe
I'm in the computer.

19:28.588 --> 19:30.088
Okay.
Let me check.

19:30.156 --> 19:33.759
Irina.
That's a beautiful name.

19:33.826 --> 19:35.627
Uh...thank you.

19:35.695 --> 19:38.463
Wasn't the youngest in Chekhov's
"three sisters" named Irina?

19:38.531 --> 19:41.567
Yes. Uh, actually, my father
ran a theater in Moscow.

19:41.634 --> 19:43.135
And he named me for her.
Oh.

19:43.202 --> 19:44.736
I'm sorry, Mr. Malkin.

19:44.804 --> 19:45.971
Your friend signed in
20 minutes ago.

19:46.039 --> 19:48.473
He went to suite 120,
but your name --

19:48.541 --> 19:49.675
it's not coming up.

19:49.742 --> 19:51.276
You know what?
This is my mistake. It --

19:51.344 --> 19:52.811
could you let him use
one of those temporary passes

19:52.879 --> 19:57.416
to just go back while
you and I sort this out?

20:00.720 --> 20:02.287
Thank you, Irina.

20:16.302 --> 20:19.004
Hi. Can I help you?

20:19.072 --> 20:20.606
Ah, yes, I have a meeting
in room 120

20:20.673 --> 20:21.807
with that man right there.

20:21.874 --> 20:23.809
You can wait for him
in the lobby.

20:23.876 --> 20:25.077
He'll see you
when we're finished.

20:25.144 --> 20:26.345
Maybe I wasn't clear.

20:26.412 --> 20:27.833
I need to speak to him
right now.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.169
You see, we're in the middle
of a negotiation.

20:29.170 --> 20:30.115
Drop it, Mr. Westen.

20:30.116 --> 20:32.884
I'm with
Russian intelligence.

20:32.952 --> 20:34.419
You don't think
my employers briefed me

20:34.487 --> 20:35.821
on the burned spy
in Miami?

20:39.025 --> 20:41.660
I <i>will</i> shoot you.

20:41.728 --> 20:43.195
Go away.

20:43.262 --> 20:44.162
Your man in there
is out of control.

20:44.230 --> 20:46.331
He's shooting
at civilians.

20:46.399 --> 20:49.034
He is FSB's problem,
not yours.

20:52.105 --> 20:53.805
See what you did?

20:53.873 --> 20:55.874
I don't have time
to deal with you.

20:55.942 --> 20:58.343
Got a big enough mess
on my hands already.

20:58.411 --> 20:59.378
I can help you.

20:59.445 --> 21:00.712
You can help? No.

21:00.780 --> 21:03.915
His car was right outside.
He's gone.

21:03.983 --> 21:05.617
Too late, isn't it?

21:05.685 --> 21:08.053
You're Oscar's handler
in Miami.

21:08.121 --> 21:10.188
He's your responsibility.
Think about it.

21:10.256 --> 21:12.891
What happens to you
if I find him first?

21:12.959 --> 21:14.393
If you find him
and Oscar doesn't kill you,

21:14.460 --> 21:16.461
I'll get someone else
to finish the job.

21:18.331 --> 21:21.166
Get this CIA trash
out of my sight.

21:31.593 --> 21:33.039
Okay, guys,
here's what I got.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.808
Talked to my cop buddy
down at the precinct.

21:34.875 --> 21:36.876
He's pulling the information
from the traffic cameras

21:36.944 --> 21:38.445
around the Russian
energy firm.

21:38.512 --> 21:40.647
He's gonna send me a screen grab
any minute now

21:40.714 --> 21:41.781
of the car
Oscar got away in.

21:41.849 --> 21:44.317
Oh, and my beers
are off limits.

21:44.385 --> 21:46.619
I don't think beverages were part
of your little deal with Mike.

21:48.956 --> 21:50.990
Is finding Oscar
still the best idea?

21:51.058 --> 21:53.593
He's running from you. He's
running from his own people.

21:53.661 --> 21:55.061
Why not just let him run?

21:55.129 --> 21:57.597
Beatriz doesn't go home
until she's safe.

21:57.665 --> 21:59.499
That means
taking Oscar down.

21:59.567 --> 22:01.101
Yeah, uh, sorry to interrupt
your psychotherapy, Mike.

22:01.168 --> 22:03.069
I just got the footage.

22:03.137 --> 22:05.872
Looks like Oscar's
driving a red Ford.

22:05.940 --> 22:08.908
License plate starts
with, um, "B"?

22:08.976 --> 22:11.878
- Is that an 8 or a 3?
- Unbelievable.

22:11.946 --> 22:13.913
Of course, when it comes to giving me
a traffic ticket, they work perfectly.

22:13.981 --> 22:16.249
So, how does Michael Westen
deal with a dead end?

22:16.317 --> 22:17.784
This isn't a social experiment,
you son of a bitch.

22:17.852 --> 22:19.686
We're talking
about Beatriz here.

22:19.753 --> 22:21.321
I know
what the stakes are, Sam.

22:21.388 --> 22:22.956
And I also know
that my deal means

22:23.023 --> 22:25.725
that I get my questions
answered.

22:25.793 --> 22:27.093
So?

22:27.161 --> 22:29.262
Oscar found Beatriz once.

22:29.330 --> 22:30.797
If we figure out
how he tracked her down,

22:30.865 --> 22:33.199
we can use that
to lure him out.

22:33.267 --> 22:34.834
I don't know
how useful she'll be.

22:34.902 --> 22:36.469
She talked
to the hospital.

22:36.537 --> 22:38.371
Her co-worker,
the one that Oscar shot?

22:38.439 --> 22:39.873
She died this morning.

22:39.940 --> 22:42.275
Bea's pretty broken up.

22:49.884 --> 22:53.153
I'm sorry
about your friend.

22:54.889 --> 22:57.891
It's my fault.

22:57.958 --> 22:59.926
She's dead
because of what I did.

22:59.994 --> 23:03.029
Oscar made the choice
to shoot your friend.

23:03.097 --> 23:04.564
<i>He's</i> to blame, not you.

23:04.632 --> 23:07.500
Tell that
to her little sister.

23:10.804 --> 23:13.540
Listen, the only way
we're gonna make this right

23:13.607 --> 23:15.175
is if we find him.

23:15.242 --> 23:17.177
Now, other than Sam,

23:17.244 --> 23:19.779
was there anyone else who knew
you were in Miami?

23:19.847 --> 23:23.149
I e-mailed a friend
at the Miami consulate.

23:23.217 --> 23:25.385
She helped me with travel
and the motel and everything.

23:25.452 --> 23:28.188
Well, that's how Oscar
found you.

23:28.255 --> 23:29.522
And if we're gonna
trap him,

23:29.590 --> 23:31.191
he needs to think
he's found you again.

23:31.258 --> 23:33.226
I need you to e-mail your friend
at the consulate,

23:33.294 --> 23:35.395
set up a meeting there
for later today.

23:35.462 --> 23:37.063
Okay. And then?

23:37.131 --> 23:39.832
And then <i>I</i> go to the consulate
and I take care of Oscar.

23:39.900 --> 23:42.936
Sam knows a lot of good places
to stay low.

23:43.003 --> 23:45.104
He's gonna take you
far away from here.

23:45.172 --> 23:46.673
You'll be safe
until it's over.

23:55.282 --> 23:57.283
There's George.
Right on time.

24:01.121 --> 24:02.722
Oh, and he's packing.

24:02.790 --> 24:04.924
He just brushed his waistband,
checking his gun.

24:04.992 --> 24:07.060
He probably decided
it was easier to kill us

24:07.127 --> 24:09.095
than to get the money
out of Anson's account.

24:09.163 --> 24:11.731
Well, for a money guy, he's
not good at calculating risk.

24:11.799 --> 24:13.466
What do you think --
I zig, you zag,

24:13.534 --> 24:15.168
surround him
before he pees himself?

24:15.236 --> 24:16.569
Sounds good.

24:22.810 --> 24:24.310
George.
Good to see you.

24:29.450 --> 24:31.884
George! I thought
we were friends.

24:31.952 --> 24:33.419
You know,
I'm beginning to think

24:33.487 --> 24:35.021
he didn't hold up
his end of the deal.

24:35.089 --> 24:36.556
Look, please.
I-I tried.

24:36.624 --> 24:38.458
But I can't transfer the money.
All right?

24:38.525 --> 24:39.792
It's not just tracked.

24:39.860 --> 24:41.561
It's flagged
10 different ways

24:41.629 --> 24:43.596
by agencies
I never even knew existed.

24:43.664 --> 24:44.931
We'll make sure
they can't find you.

24:44.999 --> 24:46.499
I think it's time
that George retired

24:46.567 --> 24:48.001
from the dirty-banking
business.

24:48.068 --> 24:49.369
Ooh,
I think so, too.

24:49.436 --> 24:51.004
You know what, George?
You had a good run.

24:51.071 --> 24:52.772
Here's the deal --
you're gonna get the cash,

24:52.840 --> 24:54.107
we're gonna help you vanish.

24:54.174 --> 24:55.408
And I would get some money
for yourself, too.

24:55.476 --> 24:57.377
It'll help you lay low.

24:57.444 --> 24:58.845
I'm sure the bad guys
you're in bed with

24:58.912 --> 25:00.880
have some spare change
they can donate to the cause.

25:00.948 --> 25:03.816
Rip off my clients?
You're crazy.

25:03.884 --> 25:05.184
They'd hunt me down.
They'd kill me!

25:05.252 --> 25:06.819
Probably best if they think
he's already dead.

25:06.887 --> 25:07.987
I like it.

25:08.055 --> 25:09.188
I-I <i>don't</i> like it!

25:09.256 --> 25:11.090
Well, you don't get a vote,
big guy.

25:11.158 --> 25:12.525
You just get us
that money.

25:12.593 --> 25:14.927
You have one hour.
I suggest you get moving.

25:22.670 --> 25:24.637
I took the money
from your account,

25:24.705 --> 25:27.073
and I deposited it
into a clean one.

25:27.141 --> 25:28.941
And...There we go.

25:29.009 --> 25:31.311
Anson is officially many,
many digits richer.

25:31.378 --> 25:32.812
He's not the only one.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.747
Exactly how much did you steal
from your clients?

25:34.815 --> 25:36.516
As much as I could carry.

25:36.583 --> 25:38.451
Good. It's gonna have to
last you a lifetime.

25:38.519 --> 25:40.253
Only way you stay alive
is if you play dead

25:40.321 --> 25:41.621
till the day you die,
my man.

25:41.689 --> 25:43.456
We stopped
at a blood bank

25:43.524 --> 25:45.758
and made a withdrawal
of our own.

25:48.329 --> 25:50.096
<i>Faking someone's death</i>

25:50.164 --> 25:51.564
<i>is all about getting</i>
<i>the details right.</i>

25:51.632 --> 25:54.534
<i>The human body contains</i>
<i>five liters of blood.</i>

25:54.601 --> 25:56.002
<i>Finding half that amount</i>

25:56.070 --> 25:58.705
<i>spilled across the seat</i>
<i>of an abandoned car</i>

25:58.772 --> 26:00.340
<i>is enough to lead</i>
<i>any crime-scene investigator</i>

26:00.407 --> 26:01.841
<i>to draw the obvious conclusion.</i>

26:01.909 --> 26:03.876
Hope you're not afraid
of needles, George.

26:03.944 --> 26:05.478
Oh, you've got to
be kidding me.

26:05.546 --> 26:06.946
Don't be squeamish.

26:07.014 --> 26:09.349
We just need to leave a little
of your DNA behind.

26:11.585 --> 26:13.186
<i>Answering</i>
<i>the remaining questions</i>

26:13.253 --> 26:16.656
<i>of where the body went</i>
<i>and how the victim was injured</i>

26:16.724 --> 26:18.291
<i>is as simple</i>
<i>as a blood trail run cold,</i>

26:18.359 --> 26:20.560
<i>destroying any DNA</i>
<i>that doesn't match the victim,</i>

26:20.627 --> 26:22.662
<i>and lots and lots of bullets.</i>

26:38.912 --> 26:41.114
All right, there's a change
of clothes in the bag

26:41.181 --> 26:42.749
and a boat waiting for you in the
marina at the end of the road.

26:42.816 --> 26:44.650
That's great,
but can I get a ride?

26:44.718 --> 26:47.420
No ghosts
in the rental.

26:52.493 --> 26:53.659
Have a nice death.

27:17.418 --> 27:18.851
Hello?

27:18.919 --> 27:21.421
Michael Westen.
This is Ivan Baskov.

27:21.488 --> 27:24.357
Ivan, do you keep a lot
of CIA trash on speed dial,

27:24.425 --> 27:25.825
or am I just special?

27:25.893 --> 27:29.295
I've been ordered to make
finding Oscar a top priority.

27:29.363 --> 27:31.697
If my agents see you
getting in the way,

27:31.765 --> 27:33.833
they shoot on sight.

27:33.901 --> 27:35.802
Is that clear enough for you,
Michael?

27:35.869 --> 27:38.404
Consider this
your last warning.

27:43.777 --> 27:45.044
What are you doing here?

27:45.112 --> 27:47.713
I'm replacing the fuel injector
of an old truck.

27:47.781 --> 27:49.015
Just came by
for some supplies.

27:52.853 --> 27:54.620
Mom, I was trying
to protect you.

27:54.688 --> 27:55.888
Oh, just stop.

27:55.956 --> 27:57.256
I think I've proven

27:57.324 --> 28:00.693
that I can take anything
your life throws at me.

28:00.761 --> 28:03.296
What I <i>can't</i> take is your
keeping things from me.

28:03.363 --> 28:05.398
Mom --
I'm not finished.

28:05.466 --> 28:07.233
Your life affects
all of us.

28:07.301 --> 28:09.902
It affects Sam.
It affects Fiona.

28:09.970 --> 28:12.104
Only I'm the only one
who's left in the dark.

28:18.111 --> 28:20.613
Mom, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

28:20.681 --> 28:23.249
Anson was using
anything he could against me.

28:23.317 --> 28:25.418
Fi, you.

28:25.486 --> 28:27.620
And he mentioned dad.

28:29.356 --> 28:30.723
What about your dad?

28:33.727 --> 28:35.194
It doesn't matter.

28:35.262 --> 28:37.830
I don't want to know.
I don't need to know.

28:37.898 --> 28:39.832
Michael, I'm not trying to
tell you how to run your life.

28:39.900 --> 28:41.167
You're a big boy.

28:41.235 --> 28:42.368
But it's the things
you <i>don't</i> know

28:42.436 --> 28:44.337
that can hurt you.

28:59.820 --> 29:01.120
You see anything?

29:01.188 --> 29:03.155
Not yet,
but from this vantage point,

29:03.223 --> 29:05.157
Oscar's car
won't be hard to spot.

29:05.225 --> 29:07.326
So we have some time.

29:07.394 --> 29:09.462
I'm curious
about something.

29:09.530 --> 29:11.731
Why this deep attachment
to the people you help?

29:11.798 --> 29:14.300
What are you
talking about?

29:14.368 --> 29:16.469
Well, here you are with me,
someone you despise,

29:16.537 --> 29:18.538
about to do something
exceedingly dangerous

29:18.605 --> 29:19.906
for someone
you met yesterday.

29:19.973 --> 29:21.107
Why?

29:21.174 --> 29:23.042
Why do you care?

29:23.110 --> 29:25.444
You don't think I want to understand
the man who destroyed my life's work?

29:25.512 --> 29:28.281
I want to know
why you do what you do.

29:30.183 --> 29:33.853
Sometimes good people
are handed bad situations.

29:33.921 --> 29:35.288
It's not their fault.

29:35.355 --> 29:37.056
You're motivated
by something

29:37.124 --> 29:39.292
as generic as injustice,
honestly?

29:39.359 --> 29:41.294
Honestly, we're gonna have to
get into it another time.

29:41.361 --> 29:44.196
That's Oscar's car right on
schedule. Time to end this.

29:55.776 --> 29:59.145
<i>If you want to incapacitate</i>
<i>an enemy's moving car,</i>

29:59.212 --> 30:01.447
<i>the first thing you need</i>
<i>is a bigger vehicle.</i>

30:01.515 --> 30:03.583
<i>A utility truck gives you</i>
<i>enough horsepower</i>

30:03.650 --> 30:05.318
<i>to keep you</i>
<i>from getting left in the dust</i>

30:05.385 --> 30:07.787
<i>and a full-size metal bumper</i>
<i>that can take a pounding.</i>

30:07.854 --> 30:09.555
<i>The trick is getting</i>
<i>close enough to your target</i>

30:09.623 --> 30:12.291
<i>to precisely time an accident</i>

30:12.359 --> 30:14.360
<i>that keeps innocent bystanders</i>
<i>out of harm's way</i>

30:14.428 --> 30:16.762
<i>and surprises your enemy</i>
<i>with a hard impact</i>

30:16.830 --> 30:18.431
<i>to force them out of control.</i>

30:22.336 --> 30:24.136
<i>And if their wheels</i>
<i>aren't touching the ground,</i>

30:24.204 --> 30:25.404
<i>they'll have no way to escape.</i>

30:25.472 --> 30:29.108
Hands! Hands up!
Show me your hands!

30:29.176 --> 30:31.377
Don't shoot, please!
Put your hands up!

30:31.445 --> 30:33.312
I can't!
They're tied to the wheel!

30:33.380 --> 30:34.780
This guy
put a gun to my head

30:34.848 --> 30:37.316
and said I had to drive to some
building downtown, I swear.

30:37.384 --> 30:38.513
You got to help me.

30:38.514 --> 30:39.878
Sorry, but you're gonna
have to sit tight.

30:39.879 --> 30:41.274
I have bigger problems
right now.

30:41.275 --> 30:42.709
I know I'm new
to field work,

30:42.777 --> 30:44.444
but something tells me
that's not Oscar

30:44.512 --> 30:46.880
and this isn't how the plan
was supposed to go...

30:46.948 --> 30:49.716
And that this is a perfect place
for an ambush.

30:49.784 --> 30:51.651
If this was an ambush,
we'd be dead already.

30:51.719 --> 30:53.887
No, Oscar's trying
to keep us busy.

30:55.823 --> 30:58.258
Hey, Mike, what's up?
You nab that guy?

30:58.326 --> 30:59.726
Sam, Oscar knows
where you are.

30:59.794 --> 31:01.328
What? How?

31:01.396 --> 31:03.430
Beatriz called the hospital
with your phone.

31:03.498 --> 31:04.765
He must have put a tap
on the other end.

31:04.832 --> 31:07.567
Mike, that was hours ago.
He could be here already.

31:07.635 --> 31:08.668
Is Oscar here?
Get down!

31:08.736 --> 31:10.203
Aah!

31:14.442 --> 31:16.676
Crap!

31:16.744 --> 31:18.578
Let's get out of here.

31:18.646 --> 31:20.781
No, no, no. You stay still.
We got to stop the bleeding.

31:20.848 --> 31:22.115
Press that against there.

31:22.183 --> 31:24.618
Sam?! Sam, you all right?
What's going on?

31:24.685 --> 31:26.219
Uh, Beatriz took
some shrapnel.

31:26.287 --> 31:27.754
We got to think of something,
'cause we're sitting ducks here.

31:27.822 --> 31:29.790
I don't know how long
we're gonna last.

31:43.072 --> 31:45.040
All right,
stay behind this vest

31:45.107 --> 31:46.941
and keep the pressure
on that bleeding.

31:49.445 --> 31:50.879
Sam, hold on.
I'm on my way.

31:50.946 --> 31:52.714
What now, Michael?

31:52.782 --> 31:54.649
Riding to Beatriz's
and Sam's rescue?

31:54.717 --> 31:56.685
What's the thought process
behind that?

31:56.752 --> 31:58.420
I'm done playing
your games, Anson.

31:58.487 --> 32:01.623
My games make more sense
than charging off half-cocked.

32:01.691 --> 32:02.891
I have to do <i>something.</i>

32:02.958 --> 32:04.492
Even if it makes no sense?

32:04.560 --> 32:05.727
Sam's
a good enough soldier

32:05.795 --> 32:07.128
to hold him off
for a half an hour,

32:07.196 --> 32:09.397
but you'll never get there
before Oscar finishes the job.

32:12.301 --> 32:13.568
You want to rip me apart
right now?

32:13.636 --> 32:14.969
Go ahead.
It just proves I'm right.

32:15.037 --> 32:17.839
You have all the answers,
huh?!

32:17.907 --> 32:19.574
Well, let's hear it!
You tell me what to do!

32:19.642 --> 32:20.975
Because we're running
out of time!

32:21.043 --> 32:23.511
I don't have the right answer.
Just the right question.

32:23.579 --> 32:26.648
Why do you think Oscar managed
to outwit you here?

32:26.716 --> 32:29.117
Because he's a sociopath
like you.

32:29.185 --> 32:31.419
He likes killing
innocent people.

32:31.487 --> 32:32.887
Wrong.

32:32.955 --> 32:35.890
This is a waste of time.

32:41.063 --> 32:43.821
If you want to save your
friends, you have to dig deeper.

32:43.822 --> 32:44.858
Where'd it all start?

32:44.883 --> 32:46.794
Why did 17-year-old
Michael join the army?

32:52.241 --> 32:53.708
To get away from my dad.

32:53.776 --> 32:55.844
- Is that what you want to hear, Anson?
- No, no, no.

32:55.911 --> 32:57.112
There's a reason

32:57.179 --> 32:59.314
you have to be everybody's
white knight, Michael.

32:59.381 --> 33:00.782
You left because you thought
if you saved the world,

33:00.850 --> 33:03.351
you'd be safe at home.

33:03.419 --> 33:05.353
And that's what Oscar needs
right now.

33:05.421 --> 33:07.088
He needs to feel safe.

33:07.156 --> 33:09.124
Give him what he wants,
Michael.

33:09.191 --> 33:11.793
If you were him,
what would you do?

33:11.861 --> 33:14.729
What would make you
call off the hunt?

33:14.797 --> 33:16.965
What does he want?

33:19.435 --> 33:21.669
He wants his life back.

33:21.737 --> 33:23.438
And who can give it to him?

33:23.506 --> 33:26.141
His handler.

33:26.208 --> 33:27.509
We need to go see Ivan.

33:38.387 --> 33:40.622
Where are the police?

33:40.689 --> 33:42.457
Too far away,
and Oscar knows it.

33:42.525 --> 33:45.293
I'm gonna try and carve a way
out of this death trap.

33:51.867 --> 33:54.435
I thought I told you
to stay out of my way.

33:54.503 --> 33:57.071
That includes coming
to my offices uninvited.

33:57.139 --> 33:59.174
Listen, your Oscar
problem is about to turn

33:59.241 --> 34:00.842
into a double murder
on U.S. soil.

34:00.910 --> 34:02.811
You need to call off
your dog right now.

34:02.878 --> 34:04.879
Oscar is off his leash.
Nothing <i>I</i> can do.

34:04.947 --> 34:06.748
Unless you want to tell me
where he is.

34:06.816 --> 34:08.783
He will be gone when you get there,
and my friends will be dead.

34:08.851 --> 34:10.485
That's a pity.

34:10.553 --> 34:12.887
It will be, because
I'll have every U.S. agency

34:12.955 --> 34:14.155
crawling all over
this office,

34:14.223 --> 34:15.790
and they'll be coming
directly after you.

34:15.858 --> 34:18.793
Fine.
What do you want from me?

34:18.860 --> 34:20.594
I want you to put an end
to this.

34:20.663 --> 34:21.963
You call him,
you tell him his target,

34:22.031 --> 34:23.831
Beatriz Pendas,
works for you --

34:23.899 --> 34:25.300
she's a Russian operative

34:25.367 --> 34:27.402
running an off-the-books
mission for you.

34:29.505 --> 34:31.505
No, that's easy to say.

34:31.574 --> 34:33.808
I want him
off the streets, too,

34:33.876 --> 34:35.476
but Oscar knows
if he meets me again,

34:35.543 --> 34:36.811
he gets shipped
to Siberia.

34:36.879 --> 34:38.947
He's not coming back in
willingly.

34:39.014 --> 34:42.784
He will if you convince him
he's worth saving.

34:42.851 --> 34:45.119
Oscar just
wants to go home.

34:45.187 --> 34:48.022
He wants to know that his
sacrifices meant something.

34:48.090 --> 34:49.524
He wants
someone to tell him

34:49.592 --> 34:53.261
that the nightmares that he sees
when he closes his eyes

34:53.329 --> 34:55.763
help other people
sleep better at night.

34:58.133 --> 35:01.269
He just wants the world
to make sense again.

35:01.337 --> 35:04.539
I know you can get ahold of him.
Do it.

35:04.607 --> 35:07.208
And if he does come in?

35:07.276 --> 35:08.610
What then?

35:08.677 --> 35:12.614
I think you have the answer
to that in your right hand.

35:18.420 --> 35:20.221
I don't like
your friend here.

35:20.289 --> 35:22.557
Neither do I.

35:32.568 --> 35:34.769
Okay, your escape hatch
is ready.

35:34.837 --> 35:36.704
<i>My</i> escape?

35:36.772 --> 35:38.106
You have to come, too!

35:39.708 --> 35:41.910
I got to go out the front
to distract Oscar

35:41.977 --> 35:43.311
so you can
get off the beach.

35:43.379 --> 35:45.079
Otherwise, you're gonna be
in the open too long.

35:45.147 --> 35:47.015
That's crazy!
Oscar will kill you!

35:47.082 --> 35:49.117
He's after you, not me.
Don't lie to me!

35:49.184 --> 35:51.185
Don't you sass me, now,
okay?

35:51.253 --> 35:53.121
You're going out this way,
I'm going out the front.

35:53.188 --> 35:54.422
This is not open
for a debate.

36:03.098 --> 36:04.999
When you write about this
back home,

36:05.067 --> 36:06.234
make sure
you spell my name right.

36:38.267 --> 36:39.167
Hey!

36:40.903 --> 36:42.737
Don't shoot!

37:25.848 --> 37:27.982
So, I-it's over?

37:28.050 --> 37:30.885
It should be. The Russians
will deal with Oscar.

37:30.953 --> 37:33.054
And since they claimed you
as one of their agents,

37:33.122 --> 37:33.830
you won't have to worry
about them.

37:33.855 --> 37:35.055
You should know,
though,

37:35.057 --> 37:36.791
if you keep reporting
on the Russian oil thing,

37:36.859 --> 37:37.892
your problems
will come back.

37:39.628 --> 37:40.962
I'll think about it.

37:41.030 --> 37:42.597
See you back
at the loft, Mike.

37:42.664 --> 37:44.499
I'm gonna try
and convince the doctor

37:44.566 --> 37:46.167
to take the crazy parts
out of her.

37:52.307 --> 37:55.343
I trust the young woman
is gonna make a full recovery?

37:55.411 --> 37:57.078
Listen, Anson --
no need to thank me.

37:57.146 --> 37:58.312
I wasn't going to
thank you.

37:58.380 --> 38:00.248
You know, I must admit,
it was refreshing

38:00.315 --> 38:03.217
to see you be honest
with yourself for a change.

38:03.285 --> 38:06.220
I think we've had
a real breakthrough.

38:06.288 --> 38:08.589
We still have some issues
to work out.

38:08.657 --> 38:10.425
One step at a time.

38:14.329 --> 38:17.298
You know, Michael, you shouldn't
be so hard on your old man.

38:17.366 --> 38:19.634
He made you
what you are.

38:19.701 --> 38:22.336
And he wasn't quite
the poisonous leech

38:22.404 --> 38:24.972
you make him out to be.

38:28.477 --> 38:30.178
Really?

38:30.245 --> 38:32.280
And what makes you
such an expert?

38:32.347 --> 38:35.316
I knew Frank.
Pretty well, actually.

38:35.384 --> 38:38.152
You'd been on our radar
for a while,

38:38.220 --> 38:41.155
and he was such a great tap
for information.

38:43.025 --> 38:44.792
More of a talker
than your mom.

38:44.860 --> 38:46.461
Of course,
the whiskey helped.

38:46.528 --> 38:49.163
I could get him
to go on for hours

38:49.231 --> 38:51.365
about how you protected
your mom and little Nate,

38:51.433 --> 38:54.402
the things you said.

38:54.470 --> 38:56.904
It's hard to watch
a grown man cry.

38:58.841 --> 39:01.676
Are you trying to make me
feel sorry for him?

39:01.743 --> 39:03.077
You should feel sorry

39:03.145 --> 39:05.012
that he never got the chance
to apologize.

39:05.080 --> 39:07.682
He wanted to.

39:07.749 --> 39:09.150
But we had to move fast.

39:09.218 --> 39:12.153
"We..."

39:12.221 --> 39:13.788
W-what?

39:13.856 --> 39:15.590
"Move fast"?

39:15.657 --> 39:18.559
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree, Michael.

39:18.627 --> 39:20.294
After a while,
the old man got suspicious

39:20.362 --> 39:22.130
about my interest in you.

39:22.197 --> 39:23.531
He didn't know who I was

39:23.599 --> 39:28.202
or the effect
I had on you, but he...

39:28.270 --> 39:30.438
Had started snooping
in places that he shouldn't,

39:30.506 --> 39:32.440
and a heart attack
had to arranged.

39:35.777 --> 39:37.211
You killed him.

39:38.814 --> 39:40.181
Ironic, really.

39:40.249 --> 39:44.252
All those years, how many times
did you wish he were dead?

39:44.319 --> 39:48.356
We did it for you.

39:48.423 --> 39:50.992
You're welcome,
Michael.

40:12.342 --> 40:15.210
Anything from Sam yet?

40:15.764 --> 40:17.335
Michael, are you sure
you're okay?

40:17.336 --> 40:19.337
You have been in a daze
all morning.

40:19.405 --> 40:20.605
I'm fine. I'm just --

40:20.673 --> 40:23.909
working with Anson
was draining.

40:23.976 --> 40:25.310
Don't let him get to you.

40:25.378 --> 40:27.312
He's just trying
to tie you in knots.

40:27.380 --> 40:29.381
It doesn't matter.

40:29.448 --> 40:31.349
Sam called in
every FBI favor

40:31.417 --> 40:33.018
to meet with
the deputy director.

40:33.085 --> 40:35.821
And with any luck, he's solving
our Anson problem right now.

40:35.888 --> 40:38.390
Well, let's hope he brought
plenty of his trademark charm.

40:40.026 --> 40:41.359
Well,
I don't care for it,

40:41.427 --> 40:43.628
but some people
seem to enjoy it.

40:43.696 --> 40:45.797
Sam, how'd it go?

40:45.865 --> 40:48.366
It didn't.
It got canceled.

40:48.434 --> 40:52.037
And now I'm being investigated
as a possible Russian Agent.

40:52.104 --> 40:54.339
What?
When Ivan filed his report

40:54.407 --> 40:56.641
claiming Beatriz
was a Russian Agent,

40:56.709 --> 40:59.711
someone must have convinced him
to include you, too.

40:59.779 --> 41:01.980
Yeah, take a wild guess
who did the convincing.

41:02.048 --> 41:03.582
His name rhymes
with Charles Manson.

41:03.649 --> 41:05.217
I'll call you back.

41:09.655 --> 41:11.923
Your friend
left you a note.

41:14.594 --> 41:16.461
"It was great
working with you.

41:16.529 --> 41:18.196
"Your need to help Beatriz

41:18.264 --> 41:21.533
"provided a great opportunity
to neutralize Sam.

41:21.601 --> 41:23.268
"And we finally got to talk
about daddy.

41:23.336 --> 41:26.104
Drinks are on me."

41:26.172 --> 41:29.040
Anson got there first.

41:29.108 --> 41:30.942
We just delivered a couple
hundred million dollars

41:31.010 --> 41:32.544
to a very dangerous man.

41:32.612 --> 41:35.447
I should disappear.

41:35.514 --> 41:37.315
You'll be able
to bring Anson down.

41:37.383 --> 41:39.084
And you'd keep running
for the rest of your life.

41:39.151 --> 41:42.954
