WEBVTT

00:09.444 --> 00:10.619
FALLON:
Whew.

00:10.662 --> 00:12.577
Do you smell that?

00:12.621 --> 00:13.752
Waffles?

00:13.796 --> 00:15.885
No, that's the smell
of our future, Liam,

00:15.928 --> 00:17.321
which starts today.Thank you.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.583
I don't know.[sniffs]

00:18.627 --> 00:20.672
I think I definitely
got a whiff of brioche.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.674
You're awful perky
for someone who was up at

00:22.718 --> 00:24.241
2:00 a.m. typing louder

00:24.285 --> 00:25.590
than I knew
was humanly possible.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.810
Ooh, did I wake you?
I'm sorry, I just,

00:27.853 --> 00:30.465
I-I had this idea about Farrah's
story arc, and I just...

00:30.508 --> 00:32.641
I wanted to get it in
the script before I forgot.

00:32.684 --> 00:34.556
Don't apologize. I love
that you're so passionate.

00:34.599 --> 00:36.297
I just wish that passion
didn't involve

00:36.340 --> 00:38.125
pounding on a keyboard
with a sledgehammer.

00:38.168 --> 00:39.430
Well, I'll be
sure to use

00:39.474 --> 00:41.128
a feather from now on.
Hey, and just know that,

00:41.171 --> 00:42.651
even though my days
are about to get

00:42.694 --> 00:44.957
crazy busy,
I am still 100%

00:45.001 --> 00:47.264
committed to making
this baby thing happen.

00:47.308 --> 00:50.093
Aw. Your sacrifice is noble.
I mean, who knows,

00:50.137 --> 00:51.573
maybe this baby
is already

00:51.616 --> 00:53.879
growing inside of me
with your eyes,

00:53.923 --> 00:56.317
my hair, and not a single
genetic link

00:56.360 --> 00:57.753
to any of her grandparents.

00:57.796 --> 00:58.884
Oh, we can only hope.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.234
Thank you.

01:00.277 --> 01:02.062
Now, I got to get to work
to make sure this

01:02.105 --> 01:04.629
maybe-baby has a legacy
to inherit someday.

01:04.673 --> 01:07.502
Okay. Which is...A work in progress.

01:09.982 --> 01:11.114
BLAKE:
Hey, Cristal.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.334
It's not like youto miss

01:13.377 --> 01:14.987
a morning run.
Are you okay?

01:15.031 --> 01:16.511
I'm fine.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.426
I just needed a day off.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.428
I know there's probably
something important

01:20.471 --> 01:22.778
I should be signing
or selling or

01:22.821 --> 01:25.215
not selling
for Flores Incorporado,

01:25.259 --> 01:28.566
but I'm finding it all
a little overwhelming.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.307
Remember, I've got
the Flores stuff covered.

01:30.351 --> 01:31.917
I don't want you
to stress about this.

01:31.961 --> 01:33.441
Maybe we should just dump
the whole thing on Beto

01:33.484 --> 01:35.225
and run off to Cancún.

01:35.269 --> 01:36.879
Well, we don't need to dump
anything to go on vacation,

01:36.922 --> 01:38.315
and the
Carringtons

01:38.359 --> 01:40.709
slumming it in Cancún?
That is hilarious.

01:40.752 --> 01:42.232
Although, I'm not
against the idea

01:42.276 --> 01:44.191
of someplace tropical.
Is that today's paper?

01:46.758 --> 01:48.847
I'm just... so lucky

01:48.891 --> 01:51.154
to have you.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.547
I'm the lucky one.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.812
Come on, let's go for that run.

01:56.855 --> 01:59.423
The fresh air will do
both of us some good.

02:02.470 --> 02:05.299
A run, yay.

02:06.648 --> 02:08.693
I knew you would do a great job,

02:08.737 --> 02:11.348
but this is even more
than I expected.

02:11.392 --> 02:12.828
Thank you.
No, thank you.

02:12.871 --> 02:14.046
Running
an international

02:14.090 --> 02:15.439
media conglomerate seems to have

02:15.483 --> 02:16.788
convinced the world
that I'm back.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.573
I got dozens
of offers,

02:18.616 --> 02:20.270
and no one has asked
about Mars in weeks.

02:20.314 --> 02:23.186
Hey, I liked the Mars idea.Thanks, but

02:23.230 --> 02:24.883
it was pretty out there,
even for me.

02:24.927 --> 02:26.755
But I just wanted to make
the world a better place.

02:26.798 --> 02:28.104
Still do,
which is why

02:28.148 --> 02:30.193
I'd love my last act here

02:30.237 --> 02:32.761
to be taking Fallon Unlimited's
carbon footprint

02:32.804 --> 02:35.546
down to zero,
or as close as possible.

02:35.590 --> 02:37.069
I love it.

02:37.113 --> 02:38.810
I haven't even shown you
the cost projections yet.

02:38.854 --> 02:39.811
No need.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.030
I have been thinking a lot

02:41.073 --> 02:42.423
about my legacy

02:42.466 --> 02:44.251
and making tons of money
just isn't enough.

02:44.294 --> 02:45.817
I want to do good. Philanthropy

02:45.861 --> 02:47.515
is great,
but healing

02:47.558 --> 02:49.908
the world? I mean, doesn't get
much better than that.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.171
Although, I still

02:51.214 --> 02:52.302
do want to make tons of money,

02:52.346 --> 02:54.391
as well.Yes, of course.

02:54.435 --> 02:56.828
Take a look.
I got it all mapped out.

02:56.872 --> 02:58.787
Our first move is buying
Morell Green Energy Corporation.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.137
Wait a minute,
the company you and I built

03:01.181 --> 03:02.791
before we almost got married?

03:02.834 --> 03:04.358
I think you mean "the company
you convinced me to fund

03:04.401 --> 03:05.750
"before pretending to marry me

03:05.794 --> 03:07.012
so you could steal it
for your father."

03:07.056 --> 03:08.710
Eh, tomato, potato.Right, uh,

03:08.753 --> 03:10.799
well, Morell is still
on the cutting edge

03:10.842 --> 03:12.148
when it comes to
renewable energy,

03:12.192 --> 03:13.758
and-and their
renewable resources

03:13.802 --> 03:16.065
could easily fit
your company's needs.

03:16.108 --> 03:18.589
You don't need to sell me
on this, I am on board.

03:18.633 --> 03:21.157
I'm also bored-bored
by the details,

03:21.201 --> 03:23.855
so skip to the end, what do I
need to do to get Morell?

03:23.899 --> 03:25.770
They're currently owned
by a company called TORO.

03:25.814 --> 03:28.208
Their CEO is coming to meet
with us this afternoon.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.818
Thank you.Perfect.

03:32.081 --> 03:34.475
I get to keep
the barista, though, right?

03:35.998 --> 03:37.478
You break it, you buy it.NINA: If I see any

03:37.521 --> 03:39.262
five-year-olds around,
I'll be sure to let them know.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.351
LIAM: [laughs] I think
what Nina means is

03:41.395 --> 03:42.700
thank you for doing this.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.224
Permits are
all approved.

03:44.267 --> 03:45.703
We never would've been able
to make the time line

03:45.747 --> 03:47.314
if you hadn't given us
the hotel and the club,

03:47.357 --> 03:49.881
so we're really grateful,
right, Nina?

03:49.925 --> 03:52.406
I agreed to shoot here, not kiss
the ring every time I walk in.

03:52.449 --> 03:53.755
See you on the 17th.

03:53.798 --> 03:57.585
Uh, did you say
the 17th?

03:57.628 --> 03:59.674
Just 'cause, you know,
you tend to mumble.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.850
The 17th. Was that clear enough?

04:01.893 --> 04:03.243
Mm-hmm.Is there a problem?

04:03.286 --> 04:05.810
Uh, no, not at all.Great.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.249
I take it there's a problem?

04:09.292 --> 04:10.554
Oh, yeah.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.121
Should I call Sam?
No.

04:12.164 --> 04:13.949
I'll take care of it.
Don't bother Sam.

04:13.992 --> 04:15.298
He's busy with some, um,

04:15.342 --> 04:17.213
important hotel business.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.302
Why aren't youat work?

04:19.346 --> 04:21.304
Because I'm obviously
making cranes.

04:21.348 --> 04:22.914
Plus,

04:22.958 --> 04:24.655
I'm avoiding my
faux-father Daniel,

04:24.699 --> 04:27.310
who pops up every time
I set foot in my own lobby.

04:27.354 --> 04:30.487
Well, maybe you should
just hear him out

04:30.531 --> 04:33.229
instead of working on
a third grade art project.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.232
Or I can just hone my craft
until the DNA tests come in

04:36.276 --> 04:38.190
and prove that
he is a con artist

04:38.234 --> 04:40.280
looking for a payday.

04:40.323 --> 04:43.195
[sighs]

04:43.239 --> 04:44.806
Who am I kidding,

04:44.849 --> 04:47.374
a third grader would be better
at this than I am.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.114
Distract me, please.

04:49.158 --> 04:50.420
I wanted you to distract me.

04:50.464 --> 04:52.640
I called Gretchen today,
my old agent,

04:52.683 --> 04:55.120
see if she would
re-sign me as a model.

04:55.164 --> 04:56.339
She didn't
call me back.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.733
That's why the mint chip is out.

04:58.776 --> 05:02.389
This is great bad news.
Convincing Gretchen

05:02.432 --> 05:04.304
to take you back is the perfect
distraction for both of us.

05:05.870 --> 05:08.656
Hi. Sam Jones calling
for Gretchen...

05:08.699 --> 05:10.222
the, um, agent.

05:11.398 --> 05:12.616
Yeah.

05:12.660 --> 05:15.358
I am willing to offer
double market value

05:15.402 --> 05:16.751
to get Morell back.

05:16.794 --> 05:19.014
Now, what do we know
about the CEO?Very little.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.624
TORO's a relatively new company,

05:20.668 --> 05:22.800
focused mainly
on environmental activism.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.541
There's almost nothing
publicly available

05:24.585 --> 05:26.195
about their corporate structure.Great,

05:26.238 --> 05:28.371
so a bleeding heart do-gooder
new to the scene.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.286
This'll be like taking
candy from a baby.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.332
[clicks tongue]MAN [over intercom]:
Mr. Colby, the CEO

05:32.375 --> 05:33.507
of TORO has arrived.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.726
Great, send him in.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.249
All right.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.340
Patty?

05:40.383 --> 05:41.558
Fal-pal's here, too?

05:41.602 --> 05:43.865
I get both of you? [chuckles]

05:43.908 --> 05:46.476
This day will be increds.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.609
That's one half-word for it.

05:48.652 --> 05:51.655
♪

05:56.530 --> 05:58.575
You're the CEO
of TORO?
[chuckles]

05:58.619 --> 06:01.883
Your assistant told me I was
meeting with "Mr. Toro" himself.

06:01.926 --> 06:03.406
Because I wanted
to surprise you.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.016
Like a mini high school
re-yoon.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.278
FALLON:
Aw.

06:06.322 --> 06:08.106
Hey, I have an idea,
why don't you two

06:08.150 --> 06:10.195
make this really authentic
and move this meeting

06:10.239 --> 06:11.501
to the backseat
of Jeff's car?

06:11.545 --> 06:12.546
[forced laugh]
Hilarious.

06:12.589 --> 06:14.286
Uh, that
doesn't explain

06:14.330 --> 06:16.724
why the public has no idea
your environmental company

06:16.767 --> 06:19.422
is actually owned by the
"oil royal" de Vilbis family.

06:19.466 --> 06:20.858
PATTY:
You got to keep

06:20.902 --> 06:21.685
the focus on all the good work
we're doing, right?

06:21.729 --> 06:22.904
I feel like
being tied

06:22.947 --> 06:25.080
to an oil company
could confuse things.

06:25.123 --> 06:26.255
Oh, you think?JEFF: Well,

06:26.298 --> 06:27.778
we're, uh, grateful

06:27.822 --> 06:29.650
that you took the time
to meet with us today.

06:29.693 --> 06:30.825
[scoffs] Like I'd pass
on a meeting

06:30.868 --> 06:32.348
with my favorite third baseman.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.002
Please tell me
she's talking about the time

06:34.045 --> 06:35.003
you played
for the Penley Pirates.

06:35.046 --> 06:36.744
H-How exactly do you

06:36.787 --> 06:38.920
own Morell Green
Energy, Patty?

06:38.963 --> 06:40.922
Well, when Carrington Atlantic
collapsed,

06:40.965 --> 06:43.577
my father snatched up
a bunch of its assets.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.927
Unforch, Morell didn't really
fit the family brand,

06:45.970 --> 06:47.885
so Daddy spun it off
and let me

06:47.929 --> 06:49.887
try the CEO thing.

06:49.931 --> 06:52.412
T.B.H., he's the big boss,
and I'm more day-to-day,

06:52.455 --> 06:54.414
but I guess I've got
a green thumb

06:54.457 --> 06:56.067
because Morell
has really flourished.

06:56.111 --> 06:57.373
It's pretty easy
to grow a garden

06:57.417 --> 06:58.635
when someone else
has done the planting.

06:58.679 --> 06:59.462
JEFF: Okay, I think
we can all agree

06:59.506 --> 07:00.637
that the environment

07:00.681 --> 07:01.725
is the priority here,

07:01.769 --> 07:03.684
which is why we're prepared

07:03.727 --> 07:06.556
to make you a very generous
offer to buy Morell.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.819
Oh, I'm not selling.

07:08.863 --> 07:09.951
Then why did you
come here?

07:09.994 --> 07:11.692
I told you, to see Jeff.

07:11.735 --> 07:14.477
But since I am here,
why don't you guys

07:14.521 --> 07:16.566
come to a little fete
that I'm hosting tomorrow.

07:16.610 --> 07:19.264
Morell landed a contract
to convert City Hall

07:19.308 --> 07:20.875
to green energy,

07:20.918 --> 07:23.268
and this is sort of my
"coming out" party as CEO.

07:23.312 --> 07:24.922
I'd love to show y'all
what we've done

07:24.966 --> 07:26.924
with your little company.JEFF: Yeah,

07:26.968 --> 07:28.491
I don't think that...We'll be there.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.275
Perf. [chuckles] Oh,

07:30.319 --> 07:31.842
and we are asking
that guests come dressed

07:31.886 --> 07:33.278
as their favorite
endangered species,

07:33.322 --> 07:35.019
so get your
costume game ready.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.632
Why did you tell her yes?

07:38.675 --> 07:40.416
We're clearly not gonna
change her mind.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.506
Oh, I'll find a way.
Morell is my family's name,

07:43.550 --> 07:46.901
and I will die before Patty
drags it through the mud.

07:46.944 --> 07:48.555
That's Alexis's job.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.513
This place is perfect.

07:50.557 --> 07:51.645
MICHAEL:
I can do you one better,

07:51.688 --> 07:54.082
ballroom.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.737
This is supposed to be
a love story, right?

07:56.780 --> 07:58.826
What's more romantic than

07:58.869 --> 08:00.131
locking eyes across a ballroom?

08:00.175 --> 08:02.743
Huh?
A-And this place is

08:02.786 --> 08:04.614
dark and moody.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.007
I can barely even stand
to be in here.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.269
NINA:
Which is why it's

08:07.312 --> 08:08.879
perfect for
a divorce party,

08:08.923 --> 08:11.403
but thanks for your
unsolicited input.

08:11.447 --> 08:14.624
Okay, okay, but have you
thought about sound?

08:14.668 --> 08:16.974
The club was built
to amplify bass.

08:17.018 --> 08:19.237
You'll be echoing
all over the place.

08:19.281 --> 08:20.543
I'm guessing
you didn't work out

08:20.587 --> 08:22.066
that problem
you mentioned earlier?

08:22.110 --> 08:24.591
Your producers scheduled
the club for the 13th.

08:24.634 --> 08:26.375
I have a wedding on the 17th.

08:26.418 --> 08:27.724
Can't you move it?Tried.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.160
Bride's a lawyer.
She threatened to sue

08:29.204 --> 08:30.466
before I could even
finish a sentence.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.815
Okay, so put bridezilla
in the ballroom.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.425
I hear it's romantic.Tried that, too.

08:33.469 --> 08:35.079
She wants somewhere unique,

08:35.123 --> 08:36.864
somewhere where no one's
ever been married before.

08:36.907 --> 08:39.127
She's even hired
a huge video crew

08:39.170 --> 08:41.738
to "preserve
the wedding experience."

08:41.782 --> 08:44.088
Look, guys,

08:44.132 --> 08:45.699
I can move you to any other day

08:45.742 --> 08:47.091
or location.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.006
We'd have to reapply
for all of our permits,

08:49.050 --> 08:50.138
and that would
take weeks.

08:50.181 --> 08:51.313
This is my only
free window

08:51.356 --> 08:52.444
for the next
18 months,

08:52.488 --> 08:54.272
so if we can't
work this out,

08:54.316 --> 08:57.145
we're gonna have to postpone...
indefinitely.

08:58.625 --> 08:59.843
Hold on, hold on.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.585
Hailey-- bridezilla--

09:02.629 --> 09:04.587
she comes tomorrow
for her final walk-through.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.720
Maybe we can convince
her together.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.115
[indistinct voices over phone]

09:11.159 --> 09:12.116
AMANDA: Oh.[chuckles]

09:12.160 --> 09:14.031
Hi.

09:14.075 --> 09:16.686
I don't suppose you've seen my,
uh, brother around, have you?

09:16.730 --> 09:18.340
Perhaps napping
in a coffin

09:18.383 --> 09:21.082
or lurking under a bridge?

09:21.125 --> 09:22.779
He left town last night.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.955
[scoffs] You got to be kidding.I think he did.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.610
He and I mostly
avoid each another these days.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.830
Meanwhile, I can't seem
to get away from him,

09:29.873 --> 09:31.745
except when I need him.
[chuckles]

09:31.788 --> 09:34.748
Kirby, there you are.
What are you doing in my room?

09:34.791 --> 09:38.142
Never mind, I got big news,
guess what?

09:38.186 --> 09:39.317
Gretchen called me back.

09:39.361 --> 09:40.754
Shut up, really?SAM: Mm-hmm.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.016
She and a guest
are coming to the hotel

09:42.059 --> 09:43.626
for dinner tomorrow.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.976
I told her it was a promotional
thing, but of course,

09:46.020 --> 09:48.152
you will coincidentally
be there, too,

09:48.196 --> 09:50.633
having a wedge salad,
or maybe a Waldorf.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.592
We don't want her to think
you're a ranch girl.

09:52.635 --> 09:56.334
Sorry, who's, uh, who's Gretchen
and what's a "ranch girl"?

09:56.378 --> 09:59.381
[laughs] Funny. Hey,

09:59.424 --> 10:00.687
are you free
tomorrow night?

10:00.730 --> 10:01.949
Because, uh,
Kirby needs a plus one

10:01.992 --> 10:03.254
so she doesn't look pathetic.

10:03.298 --> 10:04.516
I guess Adam
is somewhere else,

10:04.560 --> 10:06.388
and Alexis is in Dubai,
so, yeah,

10:06.431 --> 10:08.129
I am, in fact, wildly free.

10:08.172 --> 10:09.347
Perfect, and then

10:09.391 --> 10:10.827
maybe after,
we can talk about your need

10:10.871 --> 10:12.873
for age-appropriate friends
who are not your mother.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.745
Why are you not smiling?I have news.

10:15.789 --> 10:18.574
Your DNA test results came back.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.664
Oh, wow.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.448
Uh...

10:23.492 --> 10:24.972
I don't think I'm ready.

10:25.015 --> 10:26.800
What if Daniel
really is my father?

10:26.843 --> 10:29.193
How could I forgive him
for ditching my mom?

10:29.237 --> 10:31.326
You open it.

10:31.369 --> 10:32.806
What? No.
What if it's bad news,

10:32.849 --> 10:34.024
and then you
blame me forever?

10:34.068 --> 10:35.896
Kirby, please.No.

10:35.939 --> 10:38.289
Fine, I'll open it.[envelope opens]

10:38.333 --> 10:39.595
[Amanda clears throat]

10:43.251 --> 10:44.469
What does it say?

10:47.734 --> 10:50.432
Why are you wearing Cristal
number one's engagement ring?

10:50.475 --> 10:51.694
And why didn't we bury her
in it?

10:51.738 --> 10:53.261
I'm kidding.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.785
Cristal number one
might've had bad instincts

10:55.829 --> 10:56.873
about pretty much everything,

10:56.917 --> 10:58.048
but she had
great taste in jewelry.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.223
Is there something
you wanted, Fallon?

10:59.267 --> 11:00.572
Yeah, there absolutely is.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.879
I want to take down someone

11:02.923 --> 11:04.664
with morals,
and I need guidance.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.796
You want my help...

11:06.840 --> 11:08.406
destroying someone with morals?

11:08.450 --> 11:09.930
I mean, you know, mostly because

11:09.973 --> 11:11.714
you're the only one
in this house who has any.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.673
So, Plan A
was obviously

11:13.716 --> 11:15.196
to blackmail her, but

11:15.239 --> 11:18.068
my PI says that her closet
is skeleton-free.

11:18.112 --> 11:19.983
I mean, apparently,
underneath all of that

11:20.027 --> 11:21.942
unflattering self-tanner
is a decent,

11:21.985 --> 11:23.465
boring human being.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.510
Nobody's that decent. Trust me,

11:25.554 --> 11:28.122
even the prettiest manicures
have some dirt underneath.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.601
Not Bratty Patty's.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.125
Then I guess you'll just
have to drag those nails

11:31.168 --> 11:32.779
through the dirt
and make them less pretty.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.172
Wow.

11:35.216 --> 11:36.739
I have to say,

11:36.783 --> 11:39.742
I think this is the most helpful
you have ever been

11:39.786 --> 11:42.353
and least predictable.
Thank you.

11:42.397 --> 11:43.746
[cell phone chimes]

11:51.362 --> 11:52.929
DANIEL: Sam?SAM: Explain how

11:52.973 --> 11:56.541
you can be my father when
I've never even heard of you.

11:56.585 --> 11:57.804
[sighs]

11:57.847 --> 12:00.371
I was born in
Caracas, like you.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.809
I was raised down the
road from your mother.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.898
Iris was my first friend.
[chuckles]

12:04.941 --> 12:06.987
We shared everything:
toys, books...

12:07.030 --> 12:08.771
Beds?

12:08.815 --> 12:09.946
No, it wasn't like that.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.469
[scoffs]

12:11.513 --> 12:12.688
And once she married Alejandro,

12:12.732 --> 12:13.994
I didn't really see her anymore.

12:14.037 --> 12:16.474
Yeah, he...

12:16.518 --> 12:18.520
wasn't big on her socializing.

12:20.130 --> 12:22.393
But after he left, she started
visiting the stables.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.787
She told me she liked
the company of the horses,

12:24.831 --> 12:27.921
but I liked her company,
and then I realized

12:27.964 --> 12:29.531
she liked my company, too.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.054
So, you had a roll in the hay
in the stables,

12:31.098 --> 12:33.404
and then you disappeared

12:33.448 --> 12:34.884
when you found out
she was pregnant?No.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.320
No, no, I didn't know.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.539
If I had,
I would've fought for her

12:37.582 --> 12:39.062
when Alejandro returned. I...

12:39.106 --> 12:41.717
I loved Iris.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.066
But she told me
she loved her husband.

12:43.110 --> 12:45.503
I was heartbroken,
so I took

12:45.547 --> 12:48.245
a job as far away
as I could, California.

12:48.289 --> 12:50.073
When did you find out about me?

12:50.117 --> 12:52.032
When my mother died,

12:52.075 --> 12:54.208
I returned to Caracas
to sell her house.

12:54.251 --> 12:57.080
I paid a visit to Iris, and...

12:57.124 --> 13:00.040
I saw you playing in the yard.
[chuckles]

13:00.083 --> 13:02.956
You were about five, so I, uh...

13:02.999 --> 13:05.959
I did the math.Why didn't you say anything?

13:06.002 --> 13:07.525
Because I was young and proud,

13:07.569 --> 13:10.441
and she didn't tell me
for a reason.

13:10.485 --> 13:13.140
And, selfishly, if I moved home,

13:13.183 --> 13:14.576
it would've ruined my career.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.317
I, um...

13:16.360 --> 13:17.840
I don't know what to say.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.060
I just want a chance
to know my son.

13:20.103 --> 13:22.627
That's why I came here
and booked a room in your hotel,

13:22.671 --> 13:24.847
why I accepted a-a job
with Fallon.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.849
So, you want to start
from scratch now?

13:26.893 --> 13:28.242
If you'll allow it.

13:30.113 --> 13:31.898
Um, I...

13:31.941 --> 13:33.377
I don't think I can do this.

13:33.421 --> 13:36.337
All right?
I have a new family, and...

13:36.380 --> 13:38.730
I think it's best
if we keep this professional.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.044
How am I supposed to relax
when you're trying

13:48.088 --> 13:49.480
to shut us down?I don't understand.

13:49.524 --> 13:53.223
I thought you said
the club's capacity was 325.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.572
Standing.

13:54.616 --> 13:56.487
For a seated event,
it's only 250.

13:56.531 --> 13:59.142
[scoffs] Come on, man,
can you just help us out? Look,

13:59.186 --> 14:01.144
I am willing to make this
worth your while.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.146
Sir, are you attempting
to bribe a public official?

14:03.190 --> 14:05.845
No. [laughs] No. No.

14:05.888 --> 14:09.152
But I'm happy to host
your next party.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.676
Which will be capped at 250,
just like this wedding.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.504
[sighs]

14:13.548 --> 14:15.898
I'm so sorry, Hailey.
This is on me.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.465
I will give you
a full refund.[squeals]

14:17.508 --> 14:18.596
Low-key,

14:18.640 --> 14:20.337
this is the
best news ever.

14:20.381 --> 14:21.904
I've been dying
to cut, like,

14:21.948 --> 14:24.515
75 of my monster-in-law's
annoying friends,

14:24.559 --> 14:26.169
and now I actually
have a reason to.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.911
So, seriously, everyone wins.
It's perfect.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.434
[chuckles]

14:31.740 --> 14:33.960
You said the capacity is 250?

14:34.003 --> 14:36.919
Are you sure it's not
a number lower than that?

14:36.963 --> 14:39.182
I said 250 because
that's what my boss told me.

14:39.226 --> 14:41.924
I can't just make up the room's
capacity willy-nilly.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.622
Maybe you could double-check.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.929
I think that firetruck's left
the station, so thank you

14:46.973 --> 14:49.192
for bringing me out here
for no reason.

14:51.847 --> 14:53.283
[sighs]

14:53.327 --> 14:56.591
That fire marshal was,
like, weirdly sensitive,

14:56.634 --> 14:58.375
but hot.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.247
I wonder if he does
bachelorette parties.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.737
There you are.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.696
Can you please do
that PT trick

15:14.739 --> 15:16.437
you do for
my shoulders?

15:16.480 --> 15:18.569
I'm all knots.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.745
Of course. J-Just

15:20.789 --> 15:22.965
remind me
which trick again?

15:23.009 --> 15:24.358
I don't know the name.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.142
It's literally
the one you always do.

15:26.186 --> 15:28.318
Actually, I just read up
on some new shiatsu techniques.

15:28.362 --> 15:30.538
Let me try one
of those.
Okay.

15:31.974 --> 15:34.020
And if you're wondering
why I'm so tense,

15:34.063 --> 15:36.544
it's because Daniel
wants to get to know me.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.024
And that's bad?

15:38.067 --> 15:40.374
Yeah. I've already had
one absentee father.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.637
Do I really need
to go through that again? Ow.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.421
Right. So, shut it down.

15:44.465 --> 15:47.337
Yeah, but what if
I'm making a mistake?

15:47.381 --> 15:49.905
What if Daniel's a good guy?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.254
Ow!

15:51.298 --> 15:53.082
Are you trying
to relocate my spine?

15:53.126 --> 15:55.258
Suck it up.
This is how shiatsu works.

15:55.302 --> 15:57.217
What would you do?The biggest betrayals in my life

15:57.260 --> 15:59.045
have always come from
my own family.

15:59.088 --> 16:01.656
That's why I believe
in the family we choose.

16:01.699 --> 16:04.050
Really?

16:04.093 --> 16:06.182
I thought you were
all about la familia

16:06.226 --> 16:08.141
until the whole
Mark Jennings situation.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.013
Exactly.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.232
Do you mind if we don't
talk about this?

16:12.275 --> 16:14.277
It's still too painful.

16:14.321 --> 16:15.670
Oh.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.977
Um, sure.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.413
And you're right,

16:19.456 --> 16:21.502
the family I choose
is the one that matters,

16:21.545 --> 16:24.722
so I'm gonna forget all about
Daniel and go help Kirby.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.855
Is that an
espresso martini?Um...

16:26.898 --> 16:29.901
First, I'm your masseuse,
now I'm your bartender?

16:29.945 --> 16:31.903
Make your own.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.472
I just don't get
why you think

16:35.516 --> 16:37.300
jellyfish
are endangered.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.172
Aren't all animals
endangered

16:39.215 --> 16:41.348
if humans don't do their part
to save the planet?

16:41.391 --> 16:44.394
Besides, I would shave
my eyebrows off before facing

Yeah, exactly.

Look at Mr. Tortoise.
Suddenly wishing

17:03.848 --> 17:05.285
I were a hare,

17:05.328 --> 17:07.200
so that we could be
neck-and-neck.

17:07.243 --> 17:10.029
Uh, thanks. I think.

17:10.072 --> 17:13.249
Come on, I am dying to show you
our new green energy tech.

17:13.293 --> 17:15.730
We are harnessing
the energy of the dancers

"Blend your own."

the solar panels.

disturbing tortoise image

17:38.622 --> 17:40.102

be evil, but Patty isn't.

Maybe we should rethink this.

We're just embarrassing Patty

Thank you.

18:27.715 --> 18:29.934
You've been working so hard
on all the Flores stuff.

18:29.978 --> 18:32.937
I figured you could use
something alcoholic

18:32.981 --> 18:35.026
and caffeinated.Well, you must be
a mind reader.

18:35.070 --> 18:38.334
I'm actually marking up
the new Flores contracts now.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.206
New contracts?

18:40.249 --> 18:43.078
No company is worth more
than your happiness.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.167
We'll transfer Flores
to Beto,

18:45.211 --> 18:48.866
and be rid of the problem child
once and for all.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.265

18:56.309 --> 18:58.920
[chuckles] Wow,
if I'd of known

18:58.963 --> 19:00.095
you'd react like that,

19:00.139 --> 19:01.357
I would've ditched
Flores days ago.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.403
[chuckles]

19:03.446 --> 19:05.318
I'm just so relieved.

19:10.366 --> 19:13.195
Okay, we need to find
the network interface

19:13.239 --> 19:14.718
for the solar
panel controls

19:14.762 --> 19:16.677
and Bluetooth it
to my tablet.

If I knew what
any of that meant,

19:18.287 --> 19:19.506
I wouldn't have
needed you here.

19:21.029 --> 19:22.335
Bingo.

19:24.989 --> 19:26.295
Ah, okay.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.601
Okay, can you go any faster?

19:27.644 --> 19:29.168
I want to cut the power
before the press leaves.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.300
Distracting me won't make it
go any faster, okay?

19:31.344 --> 19:32.867
All right, we are
powering this

19:35.261 --> 19:36.958

19:38.742 --> 19:41.484
Why is that light still on?Because the building

19:41.528 --> 19:44.270
only experienced a 5% drop
in power when I cut the solar.

19:44.313 --> 19:47.316
Patty said all of City Hall
was running on green energy, but

19:47.360 --> 19:48.665
as far as I can tell,

19:48.709 --> 19:50.580
it's only the west
parking garage.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.582
Someone tried
to disguise it,

19:52.626 --> 19:54.976
but most of the power's coming
from an outside source.

19:55.019 --> 19:58.197
Holy cow patty,
they're greenwashing.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.763
You think so?

19:59.807 --> 20:01.548
Definitely.
It's the oldest trick

20:01.591 --> 20:03.332
in the "oil royal" handbook.

20:03.376 --> 20:04.942
Get everyone to look at
the greenhouse you're building,

20:04.986 --> 20:06.248
so nobody notices

20:06.292 --> 20:07.989
the coal plant you snuck in.

20:08.032 --> 20:10.426
Wow, I wonder what they're
using as their real source?

20:10.470 --> 20:12.123
I would bet my shoe closet

20:12.167 --> 20:14.691
it's petroleum owned by
the de Vilbis family.

20:16.737 --> 20:20.175
It is. This whole solar thing
is just for show.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.568
I knew this was
too good to be true.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.439
Patty is going to be
so humiliated

20:23.483 --> 20:25.049

the whole world

20:25.093 --> 20:26.529
what Daddy dreadful
has been up to.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.444
God, if we're lucky,
maybe they've been dumping

20:28.488 --> 20:30.490
petroleum runoff into
the neighborhood nearby.

20:30.533 --> 20:31.926
Okay, you and I
have very different

20:31.969 --> 20:33.449
definitions of "lucky."

20:33.493 --> 20:35.016
All we need to do
is to get Peter de Vilbis

20:35.059 --> 20:36.800
to admit this whole
thing is a sham,

20:36.844 --> 20:38.672
and then threaten
to exploit him if he doesn't

20:38.715 --> 20:41.152

35:17.332 --> 35:19.117
BOTH: What are you doing here?Uh...

35:20.422 --> 35:23.991
Um...

35:24.034 --> 35:25.819
Well, I tracked your phone,
because you've been

35:25.862 --> 35:27.647
acting off for weeks,
and then I noticed

35:27.690 --> 35:30.302
the tan line
from your wedding ring was gone.

35:30.345 --> 35:32.217
Thought maybe you were having
an affair another man, not...

35:33.348 --> 35:34.654
...this, whatever this is.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.917
She's a con artist.
She kidnapped me.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.179
She's the con artist.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.180
You lying bitch.

35:39.224 --> 35:40.399
Stop!

35:40.442 --> 35:41.574
Nobody move
or I'm calling the police.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.231
Show me your hands.

35:48.058 --> 35:49.756
I'll check your tan lines.

35:55.892 --> 35:58.504
Tell me something that
only the two of us would know.

35:58.547 --> 36:01.202
Last year, we had dinner
with the Mona Lisa.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.161
It was one of
the best nights of my life.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.773
Not nearly as wonderful
as the time we got snowed in

36:06.816 --> 36:08.383
at that little château
in Zermatt.

36:08.427 --> 36:10.298
BLAKE:Okay.

36:10.342 --> 36:13.040
What's your favorite restaurant?Bacchanalia.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.173
What's myfavorite restaurant?

36:15.216 --> 36:16.391
You don't like
anybody's cooking

36:16.435 --> 36:17.871
better than
Mrs. Gunnerson's.

36:22.049 --> 36:23.964
What was the first thing
you said to me

36:24.007 --> 36:26.575
after we renewed
our wedding vows?

36:29.099 --> 36:31.450
That I would love you
until the day I die, mi amor.

36:36.803 --> 36:38.544
"I can't believe
you wore those shoes."

36:38.587 --> 36:40.676
Oh, thank God, Cristal.

36:42.591 --> 36:43.549
Don't take another step.

36:43.592 --> 36:44.941
My driver's outside,

36:44.985 --> 36:46.029
and he's armed.

36:47.466 --> 36:48.597
Call the police.

36:50.686 --> 36:52.297
Sam.

36:53.385 --> 36:54.734
Can I come in?

36:57.389 --> 36:59.521
I'm sorry, I meant to be
out of here sooner,

36:59.565 --> 37:02.829
but Allegra was being particular
about dinner.

37:02.872 --> 37:04.961
I'll be, uh,
done packing soon.

37:05.005 --> 37:06.136
That's not why I'm here.

37:06.180 --> 37:07.703
I shouldn't have

37:07.747 --> 37:09.749
judged you
for mistakes you made

37:09.792 --> 37:11.098
two decades ago.

37:11.141 --> 37:12.795
What are you saying?

37:14.667 --> 37:17.278
That I'm afraid
of getting hurt again,

37:17.322 --> 37:19.628
and it made me push you away.

37:19.672 --> 37:21.239
But it is not fair

37:21.282 --> 37:23.153
to judge you as
the person you were back then.

37:23.197 --> 37:27.288
So, if you are willing
to give me a second chance,

37:27.332 --> 37:29.116
I would like to get
to know my father.

37:30.378 --> 37:32.119
I'd like nothing more.

37:34.643 --> 37:36.906
Do you, uh, do you want to...

37:39.953 --> 37:41.520
Um...

37:41.563 --> 37:44.697
I am more into literal models
and private planes

37:44.740 --> 37:46.133
these days.
[chuckles]

37:46.176 --> 37:47.961
Why don't we just start
with a meal?

37:49.179 --> 37:51.573
That, uh, that sounds great.

37:52.966 --> 37:55.142
[indistinct chatter]

37:55.185 --> 37:57.536
Careful, you break it,
you buy it.Cute callback.

37:57.579 --> 37:59.538
Take this back upstairs,
would you, please?

38:01.496 --> 38:03.542
The club is yours
on the 17th.

38:03.585 --> 38:04.891
I got the bride
to move her wedding.

38:04.934 --> 38:06.501
Really? How?

38:06.545 --> 38:07.981
There's just one small catch.

38:08.024 --> 38:09.983
I knew it.It's not a big deal.

38:10.026 --> 38:12.638
I just kind of told her
that you would film her wedding.

38:14.074 --> 38:15.467
[chuckles] Me?

38:15.510 --> 38:19.558
Film the wedding?
Like a hired videographer?

38:19.601 --> 38:21.037
Except you wouldn't be
getting paid,

38:21.081 --> 38:23.126
so really just a videographer.

38:23.170 --> 38:25.781
You do realize I've placed
at Sundance three times.

38:25.825 --> 38:27.957
I was on the 30-under-30 list
twice,

38:28.001 --> 38:29.655
once when I was 31.

38:29.698 --> 38:31.396
Hailey is determined to make
her wedding unique,

38:31.439 --> 38:33.920
and what is more unique
than having indie darling

38:33.963 --> 38:36.183
Nina Fournier film
your big day?

38:37.663 --> 38:38.968
This wasn't my idea.

38:39.012 --> 38:40.622
I can't shoot a wedding video.

38:40.666 --> 38:42.581
It's one night.

38:42.624 --> 38:43.886
We'll ply you
with all the alcohol you want.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.627
Hmm. Fine.

38:45.671 --> 38:48.021
Just remind me to thank
our jackass producers in L.A.

38:48.064 --> 38:49.805
for this.

38:49.849 --> 38:50.893
Hey, don't you think
we could use a producer

38:50.937 --> 38:52.808
here on the ground?Sure.

38:52.852 --> 38:54.419
You know anyone who's
willing to drop everything,

38:54.462 --> 38:56.899
relocate to Atlanta,
and start tomorrow?

38:59.902 --> 39:01.251
What do you say?

39:01.295 --> 39:03.253
Me? Producing?

39:03.297 --> 39:04.777
Yeah. Look,
it's just organization,

39:04.820 --> 39:07.562
problem-solving
and creative thinking. Plus,

39:07.606 --> 39:08.607
I mean, you did say
you were looking

39:08.650 --> 39:09.956
for a new adventure.Yes.

39:09.999 --> 39:11.523
but I don't know anything
about making movies.

39:11.566 --> 39:13.829
At least we both know
a bad idea when we hear one.

39:14.830 --> 39:15.875
You know what?

39:17.006 --> 39:19.879
I'm a quick learner.
Sign me up.

39:21.533 --> 39:24.405
How are you?

39:24.449 --> 39:28.148
I just woke up in my own bed
for the first time in weeks.

39:29.149 --> 39:30.585
I'm great.

39:30.629 --> 39:32.892
I-I can't believe I...

39:32.935 --> 39:34.676
slept next
to a stranger all that time.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.156
I should've known.

39:36.199 --> 39:37.418
I'm so sorry, Cristal.

39:39.246 --> 39:41.509
It wasn't your fault.

39:41.553 --> 39:44.207
Beto clearly trained
that psychopath well.

39:44.251 --> 39:46.775
But you knew it was me
when it really mattered.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.257
Mmm.

39:53.956 --> 39:55.828
I just wish Beto hadn't
gotten away

39:55.871 --> 39:57.699
with stealing
Flores Incorporado.

39:57.743 --> 39:59.440
Well, you got your wish.
He didn't.

39:59.484 --> 40:01.268
I had my lawyer draw up

40:01.311 --> 40:02.965
fake contracts
just to give me

40:03.009 --> 40:05.272
more time to figure out
what was going on with you--

40:05.315 --> 40:07.361
well, her.
That paperwork meant nothing.

40:09.058 --> 40:11.409
And if Beto ever tries
to come back?

40:11.452 --> 40:13.193
The FBI will be waiting for him.

40:15.891 --> 40:17.415
What's this?

40:17.458 --> 40:18.677
New ring.

40:19.939 --> 40:22.550
The old one was tainted by Rita.

40:24.509 --> 40:27.425
I love you.And I love you.

40:31.167 --> 40:32.299
Thanks for coming in.

40:32.342 --> 40:33.474
Why am I here?

40:33.518 --> 40:35.389
Hopefully,
accepting a job

40:35.433 --> 40:36.825
at Fallon Unlimited.

40:36.869 --> 40:39.175
You're obviously smart
and hard-working,

40:39.219 --> 40:42.352
and if we could just leave
our past where it belongs,

40:42.396 --> 40:44.659
I'm thinking
this could be a great fit.

40:45.704 --> 40:48.968
You've taken almost everything
from me.

40:49.011 --> 40:51.884
Now you want my self-respect?

40:51.927 --> 40:53.538
Pass.

40:53.581 --> 40:56.323
I will never forgive you,
Fallon Carrington.

40:56.366 --> 40:58.238
And I'm gonna make you pay.

40:58.281 --> 41:00.675
One way or a-nuth.

41:05.941 --> 41:08.030
Well, that went well.Yeah, not exactly a surprise,

41:08.074 --> 41:09.641
but it was nice of you.

41:09.684 --> 41:11.207
I'm working on
empathy, remember?

41:11.251 --> 41:14.820
Oh, speaking of which,
you were right.

41:14.863 --> 41:17.518
My family does have a pattern
of turning our backs

41:17.562 --> 41:18.954
on the unwashed masses.

41:18.998 --> 41:21.130
But now with Morell,

41:21.174 --> 41:22.958
I have a chance to do good.

41:23.002 --> 41:24.525
You know, and hopefully

41:24.569 --> 41:26.614
we can start to atone
for our sins.

41:26.658 --> 41:28.007
A real leg.

41:29.182 --> 41:31.445
Legacy. I just wanted to see
what it felt like.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.578
[scoffs] Yeah, well,

41:33.621 --> 41:36.537
it's not exactly like the Colbys
are designated for sainthood,

41:36.581 --> 41:38.017
which is why

41:38.060 --> 41:39.627
I'd like to stay here

41:39.671 --> 41:41.324
as head of Morell.

41:41.368 --> 41:42.804
If you're cool with that.

41:42.848 --> 41:45.024
Sounds like we've got
our work cut out for us.

41:45.067 --> 41:47.243
[chuckles softly]But I want my chair back.

41:51.204 --> 41:52.945
It's me.

41:52.988 --> 41:55.382
Fallon Carrington stole
what's mine,

41:55.425 --> 41:59.473
and I need your help making sure
she does not get away with it.
