Uncle Obie!

00:06.762 --> 00:08.796
Hey, Kev. What's up, man?

00:08.862 --> 00:10.829
Kevon, did the
Big Brother program assign

00:10.896 --> 00:13.296
Kyle to you as punishment?

00:13.362 --> 00:16.229
You're right.
She is a mean old lady.

00:17.696 --> 00:19.962
Where's the nice one
with the fake hair?

00:22.329 --> 00:25.929
Well, Regine is at the doctor's,
but if you want to see her hair

00:25.996 --> 00:28.762
there's a whole box of it
upstairs.

00:34.262 --> 00:35.629

through a blizzard.

00:36.896 --> 00:39.796
Can I have some money
for some ice cream?

00:39.862 --> 00:42.629
Kevon, man,
you just had a candy bar.

00:42.696 --> 00:46.296
Please?

00:46.362 --> 00:50.029
Ah, look at that face.
You can't turn him down.

00:51.096 --> 00:53.396
Here you go, Kev.
Get some ice cream.

00:55.196 --> 00:57.196
‐ I better go with him.
‐ No, I'll go.

00:57.262 --> 01:01.269
Well, I got a hankering
for a Nutty Buddy my damn self.

01:03.636 --> 01:06.836

I gave him my last dollar.

to go to hell.

walked a little hunched over.

is wasted.

02:56.542 --> 02:59.142
Regine, if your doctor's
recommending it

02:59.209 --> 03:00.416
maybe you should consider it.

03:00.482 --> 03:02.382
Now, that's how I chose
my toothbrush.

Synclaire, we're talking about
my breasts, not gingivitis.

Regine, your back
has been bothering you

03:12.449 --> 03:14.049
for the last three months.

03:14.116 --> 03:15.982
Maybe you should just get
a second opinion.

03:16.049 --> 03:18.182
I don't need to go
to another doctor, alright?

03:18.249 --> 03:20.482
I'll just have to get some
gravity boots

03:20.549 --> 03:23.249
and hang upside down
for a couple of hours.

03:23.316 --> 03:25.549
Yeah, but is it worth
two black eyes?

03:31.516 --> 03:34.349
Ah, jealous, boyish Max.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.582
Look, if it'll make
it any easier for you

03:38.649 --> 03:40.582
I will go with you.

03:40.649 --> 03:42.549
‐ You would?
‐ Yeah.

03:42.616 --> 03:46.016

and lunch, and I'm there.

No, no, the ice cream man
is not dead.

03:54.916 --> 03:57.482
The paramedic said
all he needs is a little rest.

03:57.549 --> 03:59.216
And maybe a bypass.

04:00.722 --> 04:04.189
All I did was ask
for a Nutty Buddy.

04:04.256 --> 04:07.056
But the ice cream man had
to dig all the way in the back

04:07.122 --> 04:10.256
and the next thing you know
his heart skipped a beat.

04:10.322 --> 04:12.022
Well, several, hmm.

04:19.755 --> 04:22.022
So, man..

04:22.089 --> 04:23.722
...did you get the Bomb Pop?

04:30.022 --> 04:31.489
Here you go.

04:36.255 --> 04:38.122
Would you relax?

04:38.189 --> 04:41.056
No. What if this was you?

04:41.122 --> 04:42.922
In fact, this should be you.

04:42.989 --> 04:45.222
‐ Why isn't this you?
‐ Nah!

04:45.289 --> 04:48.922
Now, I was built
to hold this shelf.

04:55.956 --> 04:58.989
A‐are you here
to be reduced too?

04:59.056 --> 05:01.362

Oh, no. I just got these.

05:06.062 --> 05:08.229
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

05:08.296 --> 05:09.329
People are paying good money

05:09.396 --> 05:11.562
to get
what I might have to lose.

05:13.596 --> 05:17.529
She will be back in three years
when them things get recalled.

05:20.462 --> 05:22.329
[sighs]
What if this plastic surgeon

05:22.396 --> 05:24.162
agrees with
the other doctors.

05:24.229 --> 05:27.196
‐ I'm just..
‐ Look, relax now.

05:27.262 --> 05:29.562
Look, I know you're scared,
but we're passing up

05:29.629 --> 05:31.729
one very important
opportunity here.

05:32.529 --> 05:33.829
Look at these people.

05:35.329 --> 05:37.929

Name That Surgery?

05:50.062 --> 05:51.362
Nose job.

‐ Lipo!

that's about to tip over.

Well, according to this chart,
you are too.

06:54.536 --> 06:56.936
[laughing]

06:58.669 --> 07:01.909
So, your orthopedist recommended
reduction mammoplasty.

07:01.976 --> 07:04.709
Yes, yes, he did,
but you know, just sitting here

07:04.776 --> 07:07.509
my breasts suddenly
feel quite light.

07:07.576 --> 07:09.409
Well, before you float away..

07:10.742 --> 07:12.676
...let me take a look
at your back.

07:14.442 --> 07:17.442
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Mm‐hmm what?

07:17.509 --> 07:19.409
Oh, that's just something
they teach us to say

07:19.476 --> 07:22.676

we're examining patients.

07:24.142 --> 07:25.676
Ah!

07:25.742 --> 07:28.276
[clears throat]
Well, Regine, it looks to me

07:28.342 --> 07:29.842
like your breasts
are overworking

07:29.909 --> 07:31.409
your latissimus muscles.

07:32.209 --> 07:33.276
And that means?

07:33.342 --> 07:35.009
We really should
get your breasts down

07:35.076 --> 07:36.676
to a workable size.

07:39.242 --> 07:41.509
Well, I've been working
with these for years.

07:43.376 --> 07:45.909
I mean, come on, they're one
of my greatest assets.

07:45.976 --> 07:48.142
They're‐they're part
of what make me a woman.

07:48.209 --> 07:51.642
And if I might say, a diva.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.642
Oh, a diva.
That wasn't on your chart.

07:58.709 --> 07:59.942
Okay, I got a solution.

08:00.009 --> 08:02.916
Why don't you just give me
a lifetime supply of painkillers

08:02.982 --> 08:04.682
and then I'll be out your hair?

08:04.749 --> 08:08.049
There's an idea. We can do your
surgery right after Detox.

08:11.282 --> 08:14.849
As a woman, would you do this?

08:16.016 --> 08:18.082
H‐have you done this?

08:23.649 --> 08:25.249
Many times.

08:26.282 --> 08:28.682
On many patients.

08:28.749 --> 08:30.649
And in your case, I would say,
we'd have to take out

08:30.716 --> 08:34.515
only about four ounces of fat,
glandular tissue and skin.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.316
And actually,
I doubt we'd have to even

08:36.381 --> 08:38.416
detach the nipple at all.

08:43.015 --> 08:45.949
Bye‐bye. It's been
really great meeting you.

08:46.016 --> 08:48.349
Take care. Cool out. Khadijah!

08:48.416 --> 08:51.249
Ms. Hunter, if you decide
not to have this operation

08:51.316 --> 08:53.982
your back pain
can only get worse.

08:55.449 --> 08:56.649
‐ Worse?
‐ 'Yes.'

08:56.716 --> 08:58.416
And it's going to be
kind of hard to be a diva

08:58.482 --> 09:01.489
when you're bent over in pain,
and your assets are sagging.

09:04.422 --> 09:06.256
You paint an ugly picture.

09:12.222 --> 09:14.622
Okay...I'll do it.

09:14.689 --> 09:15.622
Good decision.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.022
And the first step
is taking pictures

09:17.089 --> 09:19.889
so we can determine precisely
what needs to be done.

Alright, now, Regine, I'll be
right here when you come out.

13:00.582 --> 13:04.149
Ah, thank you, Khadijah.

13:04.216 --> 13:07.549
Kha‐dee‐jah!

13:10.716 --> 13:14.616
You know, I've known you
longer than I've had these.

13:17.316 --> 13:19.582
We've been through
a lot together.

13:19.649 --> 13:21.316
Me and mine.

13:22.049 --> 13:24.182
You and yours.

13:29.549 --> 13:32.616
We bought our first
bras together

13:32.682 --> 13:36.316
and then we went to
the pa‐a‐anty section.

13:37.916 --> 13:40.582
A‐and the saleslady
had to tell you

13:40.649 --> 13:42.616
what a G‐string was.

13:42.682 --> 13:44.349
Oh, come on.

13:44.416 --> 13:46.516
Shouldn't you have
passed out by now?

13:47.716 --> 13:53.416
Oh, and, Max.
Oh, funny, funny Max.

13:56.616 --> 13:58.249
Bye‐bye, friends!

13:58.316 --> 14:00.089

14:00.156 --> 14:03.122
Bye‐bye, double Ds.

[instrumental music]

14:13.930 --> 14:15.530
You know, I don't think

14:15.597 --> 14:18.897
I've ever seen Regine
this quiet before.

14:18.964 --> 14:20.264
She ought to have
surgery more often.

14:21.630 --> 14:24.797
I heard that, you goat.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.364
Hey, she's back.

14:27.430 --> 14:28.564
So how are you feeling?

14:28.630 --> 14:30.130
[groans]

14:30.197 --> 14:31.597
okay, I guess.

14:37.397 --> 14:39.897
Oh, my God.

14:41.464 --> 14:42.864
How are you feeling?

14:42.930 --> 14:45.297
Flat as a board, thanks to you.

14:45.364 --> 14:48.030
Oh, Regine, your surgery
went extremely well.

14:48.097 --> 14:50.030
You're just bandaged
quite tightly.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.330
I can assure you we left you

14:51.397 --> 14:54.164
with some substantial
breast‐shaped structures.

14:56.164 --> 14:58.397
Breast‐shaped structures?

14:58.464 --> 15:03.137
What am I, a muffin pan?
I want cleave.

15:03.204 --> 15:05.437
Trust me, as someone
who's performed this procedure

15:05.504 --> 15:08.937
many, many times, you still have
an impressive set of hooters.

15:11.737 --> 15:13.204
I guess you get
this attitude a lot

15:13.270 --> 15:14.637
with your patients, huh?

15:14.704 --> 15:17.670
‐ No. She's my worst case.
‐ Yeah.

15:17.737 --> 15:20.070
Cleave. I want cleave.

15:20.137 --> 15:23.137
Oh, fine. Go on. Get out.

15:28.937 --> 15:30.037
Surprise!

15:30.104 --> 15:32.270
The ice cream man!

15:32.337 --> 15:34.437
Yeah, I wanted to show Kevon
that you're alright.

15:34.504 --> 15:35.837
And then show him
that I had nothing to do

15:35.904 --> 15:37.370
with you being in here.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.237
‐ It's you.
‐ Sure, it's me.

15:39.304 --> 15:40.837
You tried to kill me.

15:42.704 --> 15:43.704
No, I didn't.

15:43.770 --> 15:46.137
Have you come back
to finish the job?

15:46.204 --> 15:48.604
You and your damn Nutty Buddy.

15:49.837 --> 15:52.537
Look, look,
kind of unfair to blame me.

15:52.604 --> 15:55.270
I mean, you are a tad bit
on the hefty side.

15:56.504 --> 15:58.570
That's it! I'll kill you,
you hear me?

15:58.637 --> 15:59.877
I'll kill you.

Nurse, oh, nurse!

16:06.610 --> 16:09.610
You killed him again?

16:09.677 --> 16:11.377
Look, I wanna take you
and get you

16:11.444 --> 16:14.077
one of those Fudgie the Whale
ice cream cakes.

16:14.144 --> 16:15.644
In his own chocolate ocean?

16:15.710 --> 16:17.710
‐ Sure.
‐ Let's go.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.477
'I'll kill him.'

16:20.944 --> 16:22.544
[chuckles]

16:22.610 --> 16:24.510
Hey, Regine, come on over.

16:24.577 --> 16:25.777
‐ Hey, you guys.
‐ 'Hey, girl.'

16:25.844 --> 16:27.110
Good to see you out. Here.

16:27.177 --> 16:28.610
'Oh, thank you.'

16:30.210 --> 16:32.244
Alright,
now isn't this much better

16:32.310 --> 16:34.144
than sittin' at home
knitting and singing

16:34.210 --> 16:36.110
"The Way We Were?"

16:36.177 --> 16:37.910
So, how are you doing?
Feeling better?

16:37.977 --> 16:39.944
Yeah. I'm feeling great.

16:40.010 --> 16:41.777
But I'm still having
that nightmare

16:41.844 --> 16:43.477
where I'm in
the swimsuit competition

16:43.544 --> 16:45.644
at the Miss America pageant,
and people are yelling

16:45.710 --> 16:47.510
"Get that guy off the stage!"

16:48.944 --> 16:51.244
No, but I‐I'm fine, I'm fine.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.677
[laughing]

16:56.744 --> 16:59.610
God, look at the way she is
throwing her chest in his face.

16:59.677 --> 17:01.250
Who does that?

17:04.950 --> 17:06.849
Hey, Kyle, Overton.

17:06.916 --> 17:08.584
Oh, Mitch, what's up, man?
Alright!

17:08.650 --> 17:11.384
Now, you guys coming over Sunday
to watch the fight, right?

17:11.450 --> 17:14.617
On that little bitty box
you call a TV?

17:14.684 --> 17:16.349
Yeah. TV's so small.

17:16.416 --> 17:18.150
Last time, went over there
to watch "Eight Is enough"

17:18.217 --> 17:20.284
could only see three people.

17:20.349 --> 17:22.584
‐ That's too small, baby.
‐ That's too small.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.750
Well, maybe next time, alright?

17:24.817 --> 17:26.050
Alright.

17:27.184 --> 17:29.250
Well, you know, Mitch,
I love boxing.

17:29.317 --> 17:30.650
Oh, is that right?

17:32.250 --> 17:34.150
Well, i‐it's my roommate

17:34.217 --> 17:37.117
who makes a big production
out of fight night, you know.

17:37.184 --> 17:39.217
Well, then maybe
you should avoid

17:39.284 --> 17:40.984
all the hoopla at your place

17:41.050 --> 17:45.084
and, oh, take somebody out
to a movie or get some dinner.

17:45.150 --> 17:48.050
Well, I‐I'm sorry,
I don't eat out much.

17:49.184 --> 17:51.350
Well, uh,
I got to go feed my meter.

17:51.417 --> 17:52.584
Hey, I'll check you
guys later, alright?

17:52.650 --> 17:54.217
‐ Alright, peace, man
‐ Alright.

17:59.184 --> 18:00.990
Well, that was
nice and humiliating.

18:01.057 --> 18:02.490
Oh, Regine, it wasn't that bad.

18:02.557 --> 18:05.790
He tried to let you down nicely
before he totally dissed you.

18:09.424 --> 18:10.890
I'm gonna go home.

18:12.957 --> 18:14.424

18:26.324 --> 18:27.657

18:28.690 --> 18:30.590
Okay,
but I can only stay a minute.

18:32.724 --> 18:34.157
Why don't you just
leave me alone

18:34.224 --> 18:38.590
Mr. I‐just‐can't‐
imagine‐you‐without‐them?

18:38.657 --> 18:41.657
Okay, okay, so I lose some
of my debonair nonchalance

18:41.724 --> 18:44.357
in a hospital room.
I'm sorry.

18:44.424 --> 18:47.257
No, it's not just you, Kyle.

18:47.324 --> 18:49.490
Did you see the way
I repulsed your friend?

18:49.557 --> 18:51.324
Not because
you looked different

18:51.390 --> 18:52.824
because you looked desperate.

18:54.390 --> 18:56.257
Well, how else was I supposed
to get his attention?

18:56.324 --> 18:57.624
He was talking to you

18:57.690 --> 19:01.230
but having a conversation
with Khadijah's chest.

19:01.297 --> 19:03.264
Guys used to talk to me
that way.

19:04.730 --> 19:07.797
Look, first of all
you do not look different.

19:07.864 --> 19:09.397
And second, the reason
why men paid

19:09.464 --> 19:11.397
so much attention to your
breasts is because you did.

19:11.464 --> 19:12.930
You left us no choice.

19:14.664 --> 19:16.697
Well, how else was
I supposed to get dates

19:16.764 --> 19:18.830
or get out of speeding tickets?

19:20.330 --> 19:23.564
You really believe your
breasts got you those things?

19:23.630 --> 19:26.630
Y‐yes.
It's always been that way.

19:26.697 --> 19:29.697
My figure got me elected
homecoming queen.

19:29.764 --> 19:32.330
I sent in a picture
with my college application.

19:32.397 --> 19:33.997
I know that didn't hurt.

19:34.897 --> 19:37.297
Oh, okay. So it's your breasts

19:37.364 --> 19:39.330
that made you top buyer
at the boutique.

19:39.397 --> 19:41.797
It's your breasts that make
people come to you for advice

19:41.864 --> 19:43.064
and make you such a good cook

19:43.130 --> 19:45.430
and make you look so good
in a bathing suit.

19:45.497 --> 19:47.230
Wait, wait, scratch
the last one, come on.

19:51.497 --> 19:53.630
They were part of a package.

19:55.197 --> 19:59.304
When I look in the mirror,
I see a different person.

20:00.837 --> 20:04.404
Regine,
you are a different person.

20:04.470 --> 20:08.470
You are a beautiful woman
who has lost her confidence.

20:08.537 --> 20:10.504
That's what made men
flock to you.

20:10.570 --> 20:12.570
Your wit, your poise..

20:12.637 --> 20:14.604
And your ability to make
every other woman in the room

20:14.670 --> 20:16.804
feel like she had something
hanging out of her nose.

20:20.170 --> 20:21.470
I had it all.

20:23.370 --> 20:25.170
And you still do.

20:25.237 --> 20:27.263
Just one cup size less.

20:28.630 --> 20:29.763
Who told you?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.230
I'm Kyle, baby.

20:34.430 --> 20:35.463
Come on.

20:35.530 --> 20:37.897
You know, you used to be
the only person I knew

20:37.963 --> 20:40.597
whose sense of style
even came close to mine.

20:40.663 --> 20:42.530
Now look at you.
What, what is this?

20:43.330 --> 20:45.197
Yeah, it was kind of weird

20:45.263 --> 20:48.197
not being the best dressed
in the cafe tonight.

20:48.263 --> 20:50.430
I mean, even Synclaire
in her dorky hat

20:50.497 --> 20:52.697
looked more pulled together.

20:52.763 --> 20:55.030
‐ There you go.
‐ Oh, I'm just getting started.

20:55.097 --> 20:56.530
Khadijah.

20:56.597 --> 20:58.697
What was girlfriend thinking
in all that purple?

20:58.763 --> 21:00.837
She looked like
Barney's girlfriend.

Uh, this?

Th‐th‐th‐this, this is nice.
