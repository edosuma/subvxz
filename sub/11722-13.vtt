00:00.500 --> 00:02.360
Previously on
"The Secret Circle"...

00:02.386 --> 00:05.083
My sweet Cassie, I didn't
want you to have this life,

00:05.179 --> 00:07.846
You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded 100% witch.

00:07.882 --> 00:09.549
A complete circle is 6.

00:09.650 --> 00:10.950
You complete
the circle.

00:10.985 --> 00:12.485
- That's my father.
- John Blackwell.

00:12.553 --> 00:14.854
He died in the same fire
that your parents did.

00:14.955 --> 00:16.856
He was at the fire
16 years ago.

00:16.957 --> 00:18.958
I have to find out
what happened that day.

00:19.059 --> 00:21.060
This is our only chance.

00:23.764 --> 00:24.697
John Blackwell,

00:24.765 --> 00:27.500
you have been accused
and found guilty.

00:27.568 --> 00:28.868
Confess your sins.

00:28.969 --> 00:30.303
What are you doing here?

00:30.371 --> 00:32.005
You--
you can see me?

00:32.072 --> 00:34.707
Get out. Now.

00:35.676 --> 00:37.510
Dawn? Did she
put you to this?

00:37.577 --> 00:39.128
She's playing you,
Ethan.

00:39.196 --> 00:41.347
As soon as she gets
the crystal back, you're dead.

00:41.415 --> 00:42.849
I found this.

00:42.916 --> 00:44.500
My father was wearing it
the day of the fire.

00:44.568 --> 00:45.584
It saved him.

00:45.636 --> 00:48.604
Is there a chance
that he's still alive?

01:02.036 --> 01:04.370
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:04.438 --> 01:05.370
How did you--

01:05.438 --> 01:06.489
Diana said
you were here.

01:06.573 --> 01:07.740
Is your grandmother
back?

01:07.791 --> 01:09.058
Actually, no.

01:09.126 --> 01:11.394
I just came to grab
some more of my stuff.

01:11.462 --> 01:12.795
Come in.

01:18.285 --> 01:19.552
Everything ok?

01:19.619 --> 01:21.587
Something happen between
you and Diana?

01:21.638 --> 01:23.389
No, but she did mention

01:23.457 --> 01:25.141
something a little
disturbing, though.

01:25.225 --> 01:27.293
Did you dig up
your father's grave?

01:27.344 --> 01:29.262
With Jake?

01:29.313 --> 01:31.097
She told you?

01:31.165 --> 01:32.648
Was she
not supposed to?

01:32.733 --> 01:35.435
Are you and Jake's
crazy adventures a secret now?

01:35.486 --> 01:36.936
I know
it sounds bad--

01:36.987 --> 01:39.072
Cassie, it is bad.

01:39.139 --> 01:42.842
Adam, my father didn't die in
the boat yard fire.

01:42.910 --> 01:44.193
I saw him leave,

01:44.278 --> 01:46.245
and I need to know if
he's still out there.

01:46.313 --> 01:48.698
Breaking the law and risking
exposure is not the way to do it.

01:48.766 --> 01:51.984
Neither is getting dragged into
Jake's memory and almost dying.

01:52.036 --> 01:53.770
Is this about me
or Jake?

01:53.837 --> 01:55.788
Both.

01:55.856 --> 01:57.557
I will not let anything
happen to you,

01:57.624 --> 01:59.620
and Jake seems to be
the guy who's making

01:59.645 --> 02:01.145
bad things happen.

02:01.211 --> 02:05.264
Digging up the grave
was my idea.

02:05.332 --> 02:08.601
And because of Jake,
I saw my father.

02:10.336 --> 02:12.171
And found this.

02:12.222 --> 02:14.474
We don't even know
what that is, Cassie.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.008
Look, since figuring out
who we are,

02:16.060 --> 02:18.361
we have tried to take things
slowly and carefully.

02:18.445 --> 02:23.382
What you have been
doing lately crosses the line.

02:23.450 --> 02:25.201
And Jake
is pushing you.

02:25.285 --> 02:27.170
He's just trying
to help.

02:27.237 --> 02:29.655
If your father is alive,

02:29.706 --> 02:33.376
I will do anything
and everything

02:33.460 --> 02:36.312
to find out for sure,

02:36.380 --> 02:38.916
and not because I'm obsessed
with your family's legacy

02:38.941 --> 02:40.133
of dark magic--

02:40.134 --> 02:43.052
because
I care about you.

02:43.137 --> 02:46.089
Present-day you.

02:47.925 --> 02:50.259
The you I kissed
the other night.

02:52.813 --> 02:55.881
There's no room for
Jake between us.

03:05.659 --> 03:06.943
You're back.

03:07.027 --> 03:08.995
Had to make sure Adam
and Cassie don't get

03:09.062 --> 03:10.413
to second base, huh?

03:10.497 --> 03:13.566
Jealousy isn't
a good look on you.

03:13.617 --> 03:16.002
I heard witch hunters
killed your parents.

03:16.069 --> 03:18.838
I know you, Jake.
You want payback.

03:18.905 --> 03:20.373
What's your point?

03:20.440 --> 03:22.291
You're barking up the
wrong shrub with Cassie.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.594
She won't understand.
She's not the type.

03:24.661 --> 03:26.596
She's not your type.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.764
Thanks, Doc.

03:28.849 --> 03:31.017
Why don't you go deal
with your sense of powerlessness

03:31.084 --> 03:33.302
and burn down
another school?

03:33.387 --> 03:36.139
See, there's
the Jake I remember.

04:15.679 --> 04:17.480
Um...

04:17.564 --> 04:18.764
Can I help you?

04:18.815 --> 04:21.267
You're
Amelia Blake's daughter.

04:21.317 --> 04:23.569
Yes.

04:23.637 --> 04:25.404
Cassie.

04:27.824 --> 04:30.092
You look so familiar.
Have we met before?

04:30.160 --> 04:32.281
16 years ago
in the boat yard fire.

04:45.242 --> 04:46.992
You were at
the boat yard fire?

04:47.044 --> 04:48.094
Yes.

04:48.161 --> 04:50.012
And I've been
reliving that day

04:50.080 --> 04:51.681
over and over
for 16 years.

04:51.765 --> 04:53.916
Then last week,
for the first time,

04:53.984 --> 04:55.935
my memory changed.

04:56.002 --> 04:57.637
Suddenly,
you were there.

04:57.704 --> 04:59.055
And now,
whenever I think back,

04:59.122 --> 05:01.190
I can see you in
the ferry's cafeteria

05:01.275 --> 05:03.142
and me telling you
to get out.

05:04.278 --> 05:05.361
Please, can I come in?

05:05.445 --> 05:07.196
I'm taking a risk
just being here.

05:07.281 --> 05:09.398
Yes. Yeah.
Yeah. Thank you.

05:14.204 --> 05:16.355
My name is
Lucy Gibbons.

05:16.406 --> 05:19.158
I knew your mother.

05:19.209 --> 05:21.425
When I first saw you
in my memory,

05:21.450 --> 05:22.511
I thought you were her.

05:22.512 --> 05:24.947
You told me to get out
right before the fire started.

05:25.015 --> 05:27.166
You were trying
to protect me.

05:27.217 --> 05:29.302
Later, I realized
you were visiting

05:29.369 --> 05:31.837
in someone else's mind.

05:31.888 --> 05:35.057
You were tethered
to someone who really was there.

05:35.142 --> 05:37.310
How could
you have even seen me?

05:37.377 --> 05:38.678
Are you a witch?

05:38.729 --> 05:39.878
No.

05:39.930 --> 05:41.447
But I have
other abilities.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.232
I'm a psychic.

05:44.384 --> 05:47.687
Every moment,
every event in time,

05:47.738 --> 05:50.690
has its own
psychic imprint.

05:50.757 --> 05:52.692
You being there altered
the imprint,

05:52.743 --> 05:55.861
and I felt it,
saw you.

05:55.912 --> 05:57.413
What were you
doing there?

05:57.497 --> 06:00.082
I was close with
your parents' circle.

06:00.167 --> 06:01.534
I helped them...

06:01.585 --> 06:02.901
When I could.

06:02.953 --> 06:05.187
So you knew my father?

06:05.255 --> 06:07.673
Very well.

06:07.741 --> 06:12.011
He was a hero
that day.

06:12.078 --> 06:16.465
His death was
a terrible tragedy.

06:18.335 --> 06:21.103
I saw him
escape the fire.

06:23.507 --> 06:24.940
I thought he died
in that room.

06:25.025 --> 06:26.776
No.
I saw him leave.

06:26.843 --> 06:28.361
But I don't know
what happened after--

06:29.863 --> 06:31.180
I'm sorry.

06:31.248 --> 06:33.482
There's no time
to talk.

06:33.550 --> 06:35.034
I've come here
to warn you.

06:35.101 --> 06:36.619
About what?

06:36.703 --> 06:38.821
Witch hunters.

06:38.905 --> 06:41.106
I've been hiding from
them for 16 years.

06:41.158 --> 06:43.826
And yesterday,
one of them found me.

06:43.910 --> 06:45.544
But you're not a witch.

06:45.612 --> 06:48.130
He was asking about you.

06:48.215 --> 06:50.883
Why?

06:50.950 --> 06:53.469
Someone else must've
seen you like I did

06:53.553 --> 06:56.172
and told them you were there
and know what really happened.

06:56.256 --> 06:58.557
They're coming for you, just like
they came for your father.

06:58.625 --> 07:01.260
And they'll kill me if
they know I'm here.

07:01.311 --> 07:02.895
Wait!

07:02.962 --> 07:05.481
Why are you
telling me this?

07:05.599 --> 07:07.817
Why risk
your life to warn me?

07:07.901 --> 07:09.568
I owe it to
your parents.

07:09.636 --> 07:11.487
They meant
a lot to me.

07:11.571 --> 07:16.776
I'm staying at the Ocean Vista Motel
for the night.

07:16.843 --> 07:18.828
Be careful, Cassie.

07:51.027 --> 07:52.611
Ethan?

07:52.679 --> 07:54.563
You sent Ethan
after me?

07:56.032 --> 07:57.566
You want coffee?

07:58.785 --> 08:00.686
He's an unstable,
pathetic drunk.

08:00.737 --> 08:02.121
And now, he has
the power of a crystal.

08:02.188 --> 08:04.857
Why?
Just so I wouldn't?

08:05.992 --> 08:07.910
What's happened
to us?

08:07.994 --> 08:10.379
How'd we end up
on opposite sides like this?

08:10.464 --> 08:12.548
When you threatened to kill
my mother, it occurred to me

08:12.632 --> 08:15.217
that you and I aren't exactly on
the same page.

08:15.302 --> 08:17.253
Look, we have both had to do
things we're not happy about,

08:17.337 --> 08:19.359
but the end goal--

08:19.384 --> 08:21.667
getting our power back--
that hasn't changed.

08:23.042 --> 08:25.594
Not for me.

08:27.213 --> 08:29.648
I'm going to get
that crystal back.

08:29.716 --> 08:33.736
And the next time
you cross me will be your last.

08:47.501 --> 08:51.069
Hi, Mr. Conant.
Is Adam around?

08:51.121 --> 08:52.671
He should be back
pretty soon.

08:52.739 --> 08:54.072
You want to wait?

08:54.124 --> 08:55.741
I wanted to talk
to you anyway.

08:57.928 --> 09:00.546
- Anything wrong?
- No. In fact,

09:00.597 --> 09:04.700
I want to throw a surprise party
for Adam's birthday.

09:04.768 --> 09:06.435
Is there any chance
you could give me a hand?

09:06.520 --> 09:08.938
I'd love to.

09:09.005 --> 09:11.891
I was wondering what I was
going to do for his birthday.

09:11.942 --> 09:13.609
It's weird.

09:13.693 --> 09:15.194
Last year,
I was so excited.

09:15.261 --> 09:17.596
I broke into his locker
and filled it with cookies.

09:17.647 --> 09:19.732
And this year,

09:19.783 --> 09:22.401
I'm not even sure
how to sign a birthday card.

09:22.452 --> 09:24.436
I'm sorry.

09:24.504 --> 09:28.324
I know he cares
about you.

09:30.777 --> 09:33.579
I think a surprise party is
a great idea,

09:33.647 --> 09:34.864
and I'd love to help.

09:34.931 --> 09:36.248
Surprise party.

09:36.299 --> 09:37.633
Well,
that sounds fun.

09:37.701 --> 09:39.251
Forget
the surprise part.

09:39.302 --> 09:40.469
Be here at 8:00.

09:40.554 --> 09:43.222
Fun, food,
and drinks.

09:46.493 --> 09:48.894
Did she say who, exactly, was
coming after you?

09:48.962 --> 09:52.181
Like which gang
of witch hunters?

09:52.265 --> 09:54.900
No. I don't think
anyone knows them

09:54.968 --> 09:56.485
as well as you.

09:56.570 --> 10:00.138
I'm just trying to
understand how bad it is.

10:00.190 --> 10:02.191
Do you trust her?

10:02.275 --> 10:03.642
I don't know
if I trust you.

10:03.693 --> 10:06.645
You don't,
or Adam doesn't?

10:06.713 --> 10:07.997
Both.

10:08.064 --> 10:10.232
And yet,
here we are--

10:10.300 --> 10:13.168
you and me, trying to figure out
how to save everyone,

10:13.253 --> 10:14.703
no trace of Adam.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.672
He's worried
about me.

10:16.756 --> 10:18.007
I don't want
him to worry.

10:18.091 --> 10:21.460
Now, how the hell
does this work?

10:21.511 --> 10:24.063
If we can figure it out,
we can stop the witch hunters,

10:24.130 --> 10:25.497
for good.

10:27.333 --> 10:30.269
Let's try it
downstairs.

10:30.336 --> 10:32.838
The symbol matches the one
on the ceiling, right?

10:32.889 --> 10:35.340
Finally making
yourself useful.

10:43.016 --> 10:44.700
- Now what?
- I have no idea.

10:44.784 --> 10:49.622
Oh. Maybe if I align it
in just the right way--

10:50.624 --> 10:52.374
or catch the light...

10:52.459 --> 10:55.193
There must be a spell that can
activate its energy.

10:55.245 --> 10:57.546
There was one.
My father said it at the fire.

10:57.631 --> 11:00.883
I just...
Don't remember.

11:24.390 --> 11:26.241
What's happening?

11:27.611 --> 11:32.064
Something feels
completely wrong.

11:32.115 --> 11:35.200
Jake, run!
Get out of here!

11:35.251 --> 11:38.170
Hurry,
I can't move!

11:54.521 --> 11:57.139
What the hell
is going on?

12:06.739 --> 12:07.669
Adam wait!

12:07.670 --> 12:10.172
Look, I was just trying to
figure out the medallion.

12:10.239 --> 12:12.340
The whole house
felt like it was coming down.

12:12.408 --> 12:14.543
A woman came
to see me,

12:14.594 --> 12:16.928
someone I saw at
the boat yard fire 16 years ago.

12:17.013 --> 12:20.048
And I know
that that sounds crazy.

12:20.099 --> 12:21.883
She said the witch hunters
are coming,

12:21.934 --> 12:23.552
just like Jake said.

12:23.603 --> 12:26.888
This medallion is the best way
I know how to protect us.

12:26.956 --> 12:28.923
I saw my dad use it
to stop them.

12:28.975 --> 12:30.859
And yet, my mom
is still dead.

12:30.927 --> 12:34.596
Just like Diana's and
Melissa's and Nick's.

12:34.664 --> 12:36.231
So, Jake's, too.

12:36.282 --> 12:38.233
What if the medallion
makes things worse?

12:38.301 --> 12:39.734
Diana's grandmother
told you

12:39.785 --> 12:41.786
that your father
became consumed

12:41.871 --> 12:43.288
by that kind of magic.

12:43.356 --> 12:45.240
What other choice
do we have?

12:45.308 --> 12:47.909
You are not alone
in this.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.111
The power of the circle,

12:50.179 --> 12:52.931
that's all
the protection we need.

12:56.018 --> 12:58.670
Ok.

12:58.754 --> 13:00.989
Maybe you're right.

13:16.239 --> 13:18.990
So are we done here?

13:19.075 --> 13:21.493
You and Adam going to go get
ready for the next school dance

13:21.577 --> 13:24.162
and pretend
everything's fine?

13:25.948 --> 13:29.417
No, we're not done.

13:30.336 --> 13:32.487
Let's go talk to Lucy.

13:36.926 --> 13:39.177
Diana said all they found in
the coffin were dog bones.

13:39.262 --> 13:40.879
Diana,
your new bestie?

13:40.963 --> 13:43.131
Faye, I just told you Cassie
dug up her father's grave.

13:43.182 --> 13:44.683
Of course she did.
Because

13:44.767 --> 13:46.268
she's a creepy little
Stepford ghoul

13:46.335 --> 13:48.703
with dark magic
and daddy issues.

13:48.771 --> 13:51.773
She's part of the circle,
and so are you.

13:51.840 --> 13:52.974
No matter what happened,

13:53.025 --> 13:54.676
you can't just
pretend you're not.

13:54.727 --> 13:58.179
Maybe I can.

14:00.366 --> 14:01.650
Check it out.

14:01.701 --> 14:04.369
Devil's spirit.

14:04.453 --> 14:06.037
It's supposed
to help you tap into

14:06.122 --> 14:07.739
your inner strength
and power.

14:07.823 --> 14:09.824
We could both use a little
of that, don't you think?

14:09.909 --> 14:11.626
Your creepy Lee friend
give you that stuff?

14:11.694 --> 14:15.630
No. His even
creepier biker pal.

14:19.585 --> 14:21.553
Mmm. You should go help.

14:21.637 --> 14:24.463
Get ordered around
by a control freak in

14:24.488 --> 14:25.423
party planning mode.

14:25.424 --> 14:28.293
Or...

14:28.361 --> 14:30.878
You could tap into
your inner Melissa.

14:54.337 --> 14:57.672
Lucy? It's me,
Cassie Blake.

14:57.740 --> 15:00.008
Are you alone?

15:00.075 --> 15:03.545
I'm with a friend,
Jake Armstrong.

15:11.437 --> 15:13.021
Hurry.

15:18.027 --> 15:20.695
Quite a barricade.

15:20.763 --> 15:23.615
I don't have
powers like you.

15:24.533 --> 15:25.984
How do you know
I have powers?

15:26.068 --> 15:28.236
I'm a psychic.

15:28.287 --> 15:31.122
For what that's worth.

15:31.207 --> 15:34.275
I wanted to ask
you something.

15:36.612 --> 15:38.213
About my father's
medallion.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.131
The Balcoin
medallion?

15:40.216 --> 15:42.467
I saw him use it against
the witch hunters.

15:42.551 --> 15:45.120
That's how
he escaped.

15:45.187 --> 15:48.139
Could I use it, too?
To protect us.

15:48.207 --> 15:50.291
Absolutely.

15:50.343 --> 15:54.229
But unfortunately,
the medallion was lost to us.

15:59.485 --> 16:01.403
I found it.

16:02.605 --> 16:03.905
But we don't know
how to use it.

16:03.973 --> 16:05.640
I almost tore down
a house trying.

16:05.691 --> 16:08.610
That's because it needs
to be unlocked.

16:08.661 --> 16:10.812
Activated.

16:10.863 --> 16:12.647
If you are
a bound circle,

16:12.698 --> 16:14.315
you can do a ritual to
activate the medallion.

16:14.367 --> 16:17.085
And then, it can do
what it did that day

16:17.152 --> 16:19.037
to Eben and
the other witch hunters?

16:21.924 --> 16:24.975
If I were to help,
would you be seeking

16:25.000 --> 16:26.010
protection or revenge?

16:26.011 --> 16:27.695
Both.

16:27.763 --> 16:29.013
Can you help us?

16:30.516 --> 16:32.534
Yes, I can get
the spell.

16:32.601 --> 16:35.687
Is there somewhere safe
we can meet later?

16:35.771 --> 16:38.556
My father's
old house.

16:59.762 --> 17:01.913
Oh, uh,
just a minute, Cassie.

17:06.551 --> 17:08.803
You should see
your face right now.

17:12.974 --> 17:15.143
How did you find me?

17:15.210 --> 17:17.145
That day when
you betrayed us,

17:17.212 --> 17:20.982
I told you never to come
back here again.

17:21.049 --> 17:22.983
And I marked you.

17:24.019 --> 17:25.819
You don't remember?

17:34.330 --> 17:36.898
Do you mind?

17:50.846 --> 17:52.580
Oh, my God.

17:52.631 --> 17:54.215
Jake?

17:54.266 --> 17:55.416
What?

17:55.468 --> 17:57.919
The medallion is gone.

18:03.493 --> 18:05.810
I'm just here
visiting a friend.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.814
Cassie Blake?
Is that your friend?

18:07.882 --> 18:09.816
You know I was close
with Amelia.

18:09.884 --> 18:11.351
When I heard Cassie
come here--

18:11.419 --> 18:13.219
You thought you'd pop by
and tell her

18:13.271 --> 18:14.488
how you killed
her father?

18:14.555 --> 18:16.656
I just wanted to see
if Cassie was ok.

18:16.724 --> 18:19.526
You were supposed
to protect Blackwell.

18:19.577 --> 18:21.244
You were his psychic.

18:21.329 --> 18:23.413
You should've seen when
the hunters coming.

18:23.498 --> 18:25.415
They must've blocked
my sight somehow.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.201
You know I'd give anything to
get that day back.

18:28.252 --> 18:29.953
Well, you can't.

18:34.509 --> 18:36.676
There may be something you can do
to make it up to me.

18:36.744 --> 18:38.695
What do you mean?

18:38.763 --> 18:41.765
What do you know
about family crystals?

18:41.833 --> 18:44.101
- Why?
- Because I need to find them.

18:44.185 --> 18:47.687
Dawn,
I can't do that.

18:47.755 --> 18:49.389
Those crystals aren't
yours to find.

18:49.440 --> 18:52.742
I am giving you a chance to
make up for your mistakes.

18:52.810 --> 18:54.694
And considering
your abilities,

18:54.762 --> 18:58.582
I assume you'll know what will
happen to you if you don't.

19:00.051 --> 19:02.068
It can't just
have disappeared.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.703
Who else could have
gotten in here?

19:03.771 --> 19:06.790
Well, the Book of Shadows
is still there.

19:06.874 --> 19:08.208
So someone was just
after the medallion.

19:08.275 --> 19:09.609
But no one knows
about that drawer,

19:09.660 --> 19:12.212
or has even seen me
use it.

19:12.279 --> 19:13.413
What?

19:13.464 --> 19:17.651
There is one person.

19:28.763 --> 19:30.964
You really didn't
have to do this.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.768
But thank you.

19:34.819 --> 19:35.986
You're welcome.

19:36.070 --> 19:38.905
But it was
mostly Diana.

19:38.973 --> 19:40.407
That girl can plan.

19:46.146 --> 19:49.616
I'm impressed. Diana was able
to find enough random classmates

19:49.667 --> 19:51.201
to make it look like
Adam has friends.

19:51.285 --> 19:53.453
Other than us 5.

19:53.504 --> 19:55.255
This isn't easy
for her.

19:55.322 --> 19:58.258
Trying to move on from Adam
and still be there for him

19:58.325 --> 19:59.926
and everyone else?

19:59.994 --> 20:01.011
Sounds exhausting.

20:01.095 --> 20:03.463
I think she's brave
and strong.

20:03.514 --> 20:04.931
Oh, I forgot.

20:04.999 --> 20:06.666
You guys are
a super duo now.

20:06.717 --> 20:08.501
"Delissa," is it?

20:08.553 --> 20:10.103
Let it go.
Have some fun.

20:10.170 --> 20:11.688
The music is amazing.

20:11.772 --> 20:13.840
And the food
is amazing, too.

20:13.891 --> 20:17.644
I loved those
puffed pastry thingies.

20:17.695 --> 20:20.197
They tasted like gold.

20:20.281 --> 20:21.865
Are you messed up
right now?

20:21.933 --> 20:25.986
You don't feel...
Shiny?

20:26.053 --> 20:28.321
Maybe I should do
some more.

20:28.372 --> 20:30.189
Yeah, let's.

20:35.913 --> 20:38.215
Well, that's
just perfect.

20:38.299 --> 20:40.834
Call the biker guy.
Get some more.

20:40.885 --> 20:42.886
Thank you.

20:47.642 --> 20:50.227
Happy Birthday.

20:52.063 --> 20:53.730
This is amazing.

20:53.814 --> 20:55.148
It was mostly
your dad.

20:55.215 --> 20:58.068
Oh, yeah. That's exactly
what he just said.

20:58.185 --> 21:01.338
We both thought you deserved
an Adam appreciation night.

21:01.405 --> 21:02.989
And I think
you're both right.

21:10.998 --> 21:12.666
Weren't you going
to make a toast?

21:12.733 --> 21:15.902
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

21:19.757 --> 21:22.408
Thanks for coming,
everyone.

21:23.511 --> 21:26.079
Uh, I'm better at

21:26.130 --> 21:28.181
incoherent rambling
than speeches,

21:28.248 --> 21:30.750
so I'll keep it short.

21:32.086 --> 21:35.438
Happy Birthday, son.

21:37.241 --> 21:38.892
I don't say this enough.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.860
I love you.

21:40.928 --> 21:42.829
Aww.

21:44.282 --> 21:45.899
Happy Birthday, Adam.

21:45.950 --> 21:47.867
Happy Birthday, Adam.

21:58.045 --> 22:02.499
Uh, Diana, um,
didn't you want to...

22:03.551 --> 22:04.718
Ok.

22:04.785 --> 22:08.471
Hi.

22:08.556 --> 22:12.642
Adam's been a part of my life
for as long as I can remember.

22:14.312 --> 22:20.383
He was...The kid who
always shared his toys.

22:21.852 --> 22:23.603
Who always said something

22:23.654 --> 22:26.656
when someone tried taking
yours without asking.

22:26.724 --> 22:30.910
And I remember
getting into the habit of

22:30.978 --> 22:35.281
looking to him first to see
how he'd react to things

22:35.333 --> 22:39.652
so I could tell the difference
between right and wrong.

22:42.990 --> 22:44.824
Happy Birthday.

22:44.875 --> 22:47.827
It's...Knowing you

22:47.878 --> 22:50.847
that's always kept me headed
in the right direction.

22:50.931 --> 22:54.300
And I'll always
be grateful.

22:54.352 --> 22:56.603
Aww.

22:59.357 --> 23:00.473
To Adam.

23:00.524 --> 23:01.808
To Adam.

23:01.859 --> 23:03.026
To Adam.

23:29.754 --> 23:31.921
That was a nice toast.

23:37.061 --> 23:39.145
That's a good son
you've got there.

23:39.213 --> 23:40.647
I know.

23:40.714 --> 23:43.549
It's a shame about
Adam and Diana.

23:43.601 --> 23:45.902
Clearly, they still have
a lot of affection for each other.

23:48.072 --> 23:50.106
What are you doing here,
Charles?

23:51.892 --> 23:54.694
Diana asked me to come.
And I'm glad I did.

23:54.745 --> 23:58.331
You know, watching these kids
really puts things into perspective.

24:00.234 --> 24:02.435
We were just like them
once.

24:03.721 --> 24:06.005
Ironically, I needed
a visit from my mother

24:06.073 --> 24:11.744
to realize how many bad choices
I've made recently.

24:14.181 --> 24:16.099
I'm sorry.

24:16.183 --> 24:18.134
Tonight's
about the kids.

24:37.655 --> 24:39.873
Happy Birthday.

24:41.158 --> 24:42.625
Thanks.

24:42.693 --> 24:44.944
What's wrong?

24:47.465 --> 24:50.250
You took
my father's medallion.

24:50.301 --> 24:52.869
Yeah, I did.

24:52.937 --> 24:55.305
How could you?

24:55.372 --> 24:59.125
Because someone has to stop you
before you hurt yourself.

24:59.176 --> 25:01.177
I need it.
Lucy knows the ritual

25:01.245 --> 25:02.479
to activate
the medallion,

25:02.563 --> 25:04.764
and until we do it,
we're all sitting ducks.

25:04.815 --> 25:06.316
How do you know that?

25:06.400 --> 25:08.485
I went to her hotel--

25:08.552 --> 25:10.386
You and Jake.

25:10.454 --> 25:11.804
You gave me no choice.

25:11.856 --> 25:13.389
This is about protecting
the circle,

25:13.457 --> 25:15.141
and you were making it
about jealousy.

25:15.192 --> 25:20.079
Jake accepts that dark magic is
a part of me.

25:20.147 --> 25:23.399
And he doesn't ask me
to hide from who I am.

25:23.467 --> 25:25.668
- Who you are?
- Mmm.

25:25.736 --> 25:27.954
Jake's killed people
for being who you are.

25:28.005 --> 25:30.173
He hasn't killed
anyone.

25:30.257 --> 25:32.959
He came back looking
for revenge after Nick's death,

25:33.027 --> 25:35.211
and maybe he planned
on taking that out on the circle,

25:35.296 --> 25:37.430
but he didn't go through
with it.

25:37.497 --> 25:39.498
He's changed.

25:39.550 --> 25:42.685
Are you sure,

25:42.770 --> 25:45.371
or is that just what
you want to believe?

26:05.734 --> 26:07.568
You were supposed to
call me from the car.

26:07.652 --> 26:09.770
I wanted to come
check out the party.

26:12.390 --> 26:13.691
Are you Callum?

26:13.742 --> 26:15.859
The devil stuff guy?

26:15.910 --> 26:18.328
I've been called
worse.

26:18.396 --> 26:20.230
I'm Melissa.

26:22.417 --> 26:24.218
Did you bring it?

26:35.430 --> 26:38.215
Great. Transaction done.
Now you can go.

26:38.266 --> 26:40.917
I think I'll stay.

26:40.969 --> 26:43.604
Suddenly, the night
just shows some great potential.

26:43.688 --> 26:45.606
This is a private party,
Callum.

26:48.476 --> 26:51.445
- What's up?
- I've got this, Jake.

26:51.529 --> 26:54.931
Better listen to her, "Jake."
She's got this.

26:54.983 --> 26:56.784
Who are you?

26:57.819 --> 27:02.156
A friend of Faye's
voodoo boyfriend.

27:05.610 --> 27:07.327
Get out.

27:16.621 --> 27:19.956
Watch your back, Jake.

27:31.686 --> 27:33.270
Where did you go?

27:33.321 --> 27:35.806
To the boat.

27:37.659 --> 27:39.660
Here you go.

27:43.531 --> 27:47.317
I have no right to
make decisions for you.

27:47.368 --> 27:51.121
Thank you.

27:51.172 --> 27:53.590
I'll let Lucy and the rest of
the circle know.

27:53.658 --> 27:56.693
How do you know everyone
will agree to do it?

27:56.761 --> 28:00.297
It's the only way to
protect ourselves.

28:00.348 --> 28:02.432
Maybe.

28:04.519 --> 28:07.471
Everything I said
about Jake is true.

28:07.522 --> 28:10.841
And somewhere
inside you,

28:10.859 --> 28:12.693
I think you know it.

28:28.409 --> 28:29.710
Mm.

28:29.794 --> 28:31.712
Dad?

28:31.796 --> 28:33.580
You ok?

28:33.665 --> 28:35.966
Well, I didn't have a drink,
if that's what you mean.

28:36.033 --> 28:38.969
No, I was just--
it's ok, kid. Really.

28:39.036 --> 28:41.722
I'm just wiped out. I must be
coming down with something.

28:41.806 --> 28:44.975
Dad.

28:45.042 --> 28:46.510
Thanks for the party.

28:46.578 --> 28:49.146
Everybody's having
a great time.

28:49.213 --> 28:51.899
Means a lot to me.

28:51.966 --> 28:53.984
I'm glad.

28:54.051 --> 28:57.855
You have a lot of friends here
who really care about you.

28:57.906 --> 29:00.891
I'm going to go grab
some aspirin.

29:00.942 --> 29:02.609
Go have fun.

29:18.343 --> 29:20.510
You ok?

29:25.066 --> 29:26.934
Where'd you get that?

29:27.001 --> 29:29.570
Adam had it.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.171
He stole it.

29:31.239 --> 29:32.589
To protect me.

29:32.657 --> 29:34.358
- From what?
- Its power.

29:34.425 --> 29:36.259
The potential for dark magic
inside of it.

29:36.311 --> 29:38.946
He doesn't think you can
handle it. He's wrong.

29:39.030 --> 29:40.480
No, that's not it.

29:40.548 --> 29:41.698
He thinks that
it's dangerous.

29:41.766 --> 29:43.934
I don't care
what Adam thinks.

29:43.985 --> 29:46.102
I care
what you think.

29:50.158 --> 29:53.443
Have you ever murdered
a witch?

30:03.171 --> 30:05.005
Cassie.

30:19.404 --> 30:21.521
Come in.

30:24.993 --> 30:26.276
We can sit in
the living room.

30:26.327 --> 30:28.612
I've gathered photos
that will help us

30:28.663 --> 30:32.449
tap into
each family's energies.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.751
We're not going
to need them.

30:37.422 --> 30:38.989
Lucy.

30:48.833 --> 30:51.285
You can forget
the crystals, Dawn.

30:51.352 --> 30:54.021
You see, the witch hunters are
coming back to Chance Harbor.

30:54.105 --> 30:57.874
And after tonight, the circle
won't have any power to stop them.

30:57.942 --> 31:02.779
I've always been
on the right side, Dawn.

31:02.847 --> 31:05.282
And it was never yours.

31:18.593 --> 31:20.094
That was
a great party, Adam.

31:20.178 --> 31:21.845
I had so much fun.

31:21.913 --> 31:23.630
Happy Birthday,
Adam!

31:25.433 --> 31:27.217
So we just have to
do what you say

31:27.268 --> 31:29.019
'cause you're
the queen of dark magic?

31:29.087 --> 31:30.687
If we don't activate
the medallion,

31:30.755 --> 31:32.606
then we're vulnerable to
witch hunters.

31:32.690 --> 31:34.441
We don't know that.
Maybe we can use

31:34.526 --> 31:35.526
our full power
to stop them

31:35.593 --> 31:36.593
without
the medallion.

31:36.644 --> 31:38.846
But why take the chance?

31:38.913 --> 31:40.230
You saw your father
use it, right?

31:40.281 --> 31:41.365
You know it works?

31:41.432 --> 31:42.783
Yes.

31:42.867 --> 31:44.701
Then I think we
should activate it.

31:44.769 --> 31:45.869
Me, too.

31:45.937 --> 31:48.005
Fine.

31:51.876 --> 31:55.662
Ok. I'll go along with
the rest of the circle.

31:55.730 --> 31:58.293
All right. I told Lucy
we'd meet in the woods

31:58.318 --> 31:59.518
behind the house.

32:05.957 --> 32:07.808
Adam...

32:10.795 --> 32:13.881
You were right.
About Jake.

32:16.634 --> 32:19.953
I accept who you are.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.682
I just don't accept
that you're only defined

32:22.707 --> 32:23.907
by dark magic.

32:24.225 --> 32:28.078
I think you're...
Much more than that.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.699
I know.

33:07.118 --> 33:10.537
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's ok.

33:10.622 --> 33:14.124
Well, the sooner we start,
the safer you'll be.

33:14.192 --> 33:17.828
Form a circle around the fire
and hold hands.

33:17.879 --> 33:19.749
The last time we
all stood around a fire,

33:19.774 --> 33:20.974
we bound the circle.

33:21.199 --> 33:23.083
And look how well
that worked out.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.866
Focus on the fire.

33:55.917 --> 33:58.068
Breathe deeply,

33:58.119 --> 34:00.003
slowly.

34:00.071 --> 34:02.706
Air we breathe,

34:02.757 --> 34:04.925
and fire we feel.

34:04.993 --> 34:06.910
Air we breathe,

34:06.961 --> 34:09.129
and fire we feel.

34:12.217 --> 34:15.018
The medallion's
getting warm.

34:16.020 --> 34:19.056
Stay focused,
Cassie.

34:19.107 --> 34:21.725
Air we breathe.

34:21.775 --> 34:23.944
And fire we feel.

34:24.027 --> 34:25.762
Air we breathe,

34:25.813 --> 34:28.197
and fire we feel.

34:30.034 --> 34:31.818
I don't feel
so great.

34:31.902 --> 34:34.788
What you're feeling is your
magic activating the medallion.

34:34.871 --> 34:35.956
We're almost done.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.741
By this circle,

34:37.792 --> 34:40.210
bind air and fire
to metal,

34:40.277 --> 34:42.445
and ignite its power.

34:42.496 --> 34:45.415
By this circle,

34:45.466 --> 34:48.118
bind air and fire
to metal,

34:48.168 --> 34:51.054
and ignite its power.

34:55.143 --> 34:56.260
Oh.

34:58.429 --> 35:02.266
No, something's wrong.
I--I can feel it.

35:02.317 --> 35:04.467
It feels
like it did

35:04.519 --> 35:07.470
when Faye tried the spell
at the fire and ice dance.

35:09.490 --> 35:13.026
The medallion, it's
taking our magic.

35:14.162 --> 35:16.997
I'm sorry.

35:17.065 --> 35:20.534
The medallion channels
power in or out.

35:20.618 --> 35:22.753
It's stolen the magic
from thousands of witches.

35:22.820 --> 35:25.005
That's what makes it
so strong.

35:27.041 --> 35:29.826
Now,
it's taking yours.

35:30.795 --> 35:33.347
This is my father's
medallion.

35:33.431 --> 35:37.050
I saw him use it against
the witch hunters.

35:40.004 --> 35:42.556
And I remember
what he said now.

35:44.008 --> 35:45.776
No.

35:45.843 --> 35:47.861
Ignus despair
ad volum.

35:53.184 --> 35:54.951
You lied
about everything.

35:55.019 --> 35:56.987
She must be working
for the witch hunters.

35:57.038 --> 35:58.521
- Is that true?
- They threatened me.

35:58.573 --> 35:59.740
Gave me no choice.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.508
You told me that
you didn't know

36:01.576 --> 36:03.410
if my father
was alive or dead.

36:03.478 --> 36:05.629
But if you're really
a psychic,

36:05.697 --> 36:08.131
you could sense
his energy.

36:08.199 --> 36:10.133
Tell me the truth.

36:10.201 --> 36:12.886
Is he alive?

36:15.373 --> 36:16.807
Yes.

36:16.874 --> 36:20.227
No one has any idea
where he is. No one.

36:21.229 --> 36:23.847
Aah! Hey!
I swear it!

36:23.898 --> 36:27.550
Kill me, go ahead,
but I don't know anything more.

36:29.570 --> 36:32.155
Never come back
to Chance Harbor.

36:32.223 --> 36:34.524
And you can tell the witch
hunters that I have the medallion,

36:34.575 --> 36:37.077
and I know
how to use it.

36:37.161 --> 36:39.663
We're ready for them.

36:42.784 --> 36:45.285
Let her go.

36:47.255 --> 36:49.906
She's not
coming back.

37:01.663 --> 37:03.113
Are you ok?

37:03.198 --> 37:07.034
My father's alive.

37:07.085 --> 37:09.203
I need to find him.

37:09.254 --> 37:10.537
I'll help you.

37:10.588 --> 37:12.840
I don't think so.

37:12.907 --> 37:14.625
Don't push me away.

37:14.709 --> 37:16.260
We're not so different.

37:16.344 --> 37:18.929
What you were feeling
here with Lucy,

37:18.997 --> 37:21.598
letting your anger
drive you,

37:21.683 --> 37:24.935
that's what you'll need
to beat the witch hunters.

37:25.019 --> 37:27.437
No.

37:27.522 --> 37:30.641
I'm not like you
at all, Jake.

37:58.937 --> 38:00.470
Dawn.

38:24.162 --> 38:26.430
You saved me.

38:26.497 --> 38:28.482
Yeah.

38:41.396 --> 38:42.930
I was surprised
you called.

38:42.997 --> 38:45.399
But I'm glad you did.

38:46.968 --> 38:49.136
Thing is,

38:49.187 --> 38:51.872
you remind me of
an old boyfriend of mine.

38:51.940 --> 38:54.274
You miss an old flame,
I reap the benefits.

38:54.342 --> 38:57.644
This is about
devil's spirit.

38:57.712 --> 39:00.814
It made the night
a lot easier.

39:11.209 --> 39:14.077
You went through that
last bag a little fast.

39:14.178 --> 39:16.330
Please be careful, ok?

39:20.001 --> 39:21.885
I can take care
of myself.

39:21.970 --> 39:24.187
No doubt.

39:30.011 --> 39:33.563
I got your text.
What do you want?

40:04.595 --> 40:07.297
You failed.

40:07.382 --> 40:10.050
I'm the one
who came to you.

40:10.101 --> 40:11.702
I'm the one
who told you

40:11.769 --> 40:13.603
Cassie Blake saw
the medallion.

40:15.189 --> 40:16.523
If I hadn't seen her
in my memory,

40:16.590 --> 40:18.542
you'd never know
where it was.

40:18.609 --> 40:22.846
And yet, you weren't able
to bring it back to me.

40:22.914 --> 40:24.648
By leaving it behind,

40:24.716 --> 40:28.952
you've opened the door
for Blackwell's return.

40:29.037 --> 40:32.739
I'm sorry.
She was too strong.

40:32.790 --> 40:35.742
So I keep hearing.

40:35.793 --> 40:39.496
I guess I'm just going to
have to see for myself.

41:46.948 --> 41:49.816
Daddy.
