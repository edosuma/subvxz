WEBVTT

01:04.709 --> 01:05.959
Alright, everybody.

01:06.041 --> 01:10.458
fast

01:15.709 --> 01:17.625
- Ready?
- I was born ready.

01:17.709 --> 01:19.917
Good, 'cause today's the day
I'm going to kick your butt.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.542
Why, you been practicing
on the side?

01:21.625 --> 01:24.875
Oh, that's for me to
know
and you to find out,
alright.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.542
Hey, so I heard they're
trying
to get roller skating

01:26.625 --> 01:28.208
into the 1980 Olympics.

01:28.291 --> 01:30.083
Wow, it's about time.

01:30.166 --> 01:32.667
And if we train really hard,
maybe we can make it.

01:32.750 --> 01:35.000
It would be so cool
to win a medal.

01:35.083 --> 01:37.959
Can you imagine being that good?

01:38.041 --> 01:40.792
Yep.

01:56.458 --> 01:58.250
I'm going to beat
you
one of these days.

01:58.333 --> 02:00.709
[chuckles]
Oh, dream on.

02:56.417 --> 02:58.417
This is Dawn Wheeler,
she claims to have information

02:58.500 --> 03:00.458
'on an old case.'

03:00.542 --> 03:02.417
Captain Fashion says
if I tell you what I know

03:02.500 --> 03:05.834
I get one
of those downward departures.

03:05.917 --> 03:07.667
(Valens)
'Well, that's up
to the judge.'

03:07.750 --> 03:10.000
All we can do is listen.

03:10.083 --> 03:12.291
You made it sound
like a done deal.

03:12.375 --> 03:13.917
(Rush)
'Well, tell us
what you got.'

03:14.000 --> 03:15.083
If we think it's
worth investigating

03:15.166 --> 03:18.000
we'll see what we can do.

03:18.083 --> 03:22.333
High school girl was found dead
in Fairmount Park back in '78.

03:22.417 --> 03:23.709
Missy Gallavan.

03:23.792 --> 03:25.500
(Dawn)
'All over the news.'

03:25.583 --> 03:27.625
You never found the guy
who did it, did you?

03:27.709 --> 03:29.041
And you saw the guy?

03:29.875 --> 03:30.959
No.

03:31.041 --> 03:34.083
But I saw the van
she was getting in.

03:34.166 --> 03:35.834
- In the park?
- No.

03:35.917 --> 03:38.500
Outside a roller rink
in Mayfair.

03:38.583 --> 03:40.417
(Dawn)
'One of those customized vans'

03:40.500 --> 03:42.458
had a picture painted
on the side.

03:42.542 --> 03:44.083
(Rush)
'What kind of picture?'

03:44.166 --> 03:45.625
A spaceship.

03:45.709 --> 03:47.333
You see little green men, too?

03:50.208 --> 03:51.291
I know what I saw.

03:51.375 --> 03:53.458
- What color was the van?
- Black.

03:53.542 --> 03:54.792
What were you doing
outside the rink?

03:54.875 --> 03:57.333
Smoking a little herbal remedy.

03:57.417 --> 03:58.792
And did you know Missy?

03:58.875 --> 04:01.959
I'd seen her around the rink.
Girl could skate.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.166
But you didn't say
anything in '78.

04:04.250 --> 04:07.000
My jackass boyfriend
boosted a car the next night.

04:07.083 --> 04:08.625
'We hightailed it to Florida.'

04:08.709 --> 04:11.208
Got the gimme's
in a bunch of liquor stores.

04:11.291 --> 04:13.834
Just couldn't say no
to old Captain Morgan.

04:13.917 --> 04:14.917
Hmm.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.125
What they got you for now?

04:16.208 --> 04:17.917
Armed robbery.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.875
Looking at ten to twelve.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.875
But what I told you, that's
got
to be worth something, right?

04:23.959 --> 04:25.166
We'll let you know.

04:25.250 --> 04:27.875
That's it?

04:27.959 --> 04:29.875
I got to go back to lockup?

04:29.959 --> 04:32.083
That girl's family's
been in the dark for 30 years

04:32.166 --> 04:33.542
while you sat
on that information.

04:33.625 --> 04:36.166
I think you and Captain
Fashion
can sweat a few days

04:36.250 --> 04:38.291
while we check
if your story holds water.

04:40.250 --> 04:41.625
Okay, Dawn?

05:21.959 --> 05:24.917
(Rush)
Ever go to the roller
rink
back in the '70s?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.542
Roller disco back then.

05:26.625 --> 05:29.417
Like a regular club,
just on skates.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.875
I had the ones
that clipped on your sneakers.

05:31.959 --> 05:33.375
I used a key to tighten them.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.125
Outdoor skates.
Old school.

05:36.208 --> 05:38.917
I spent hours
patrolling
the neighborhood.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.083
I was more
into the night scene.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.750
Ah, rocking the leisure suit?

05:42.834 --> 05:44.417
Watch yourself now.

05:46.709 --> 05:48.417
I bet I'm faster.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.667
Trust me, Lil,
different leagues.

05:53.583 --> 05:56.583
Ah, Missy Gallavan,
15 years old.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.583
A jogger discovered
her body in a ravine

05:58.667 --> 06:01.500
in Fairmount Park,
near Tacony Creek.

06:01.583 --> 06:02.917
Time of death around midnight.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.417
Blunt-force trauma to the
head,
possibly from a fall.

06:05.500 --> 06:09.417
Abrasions on her knees
and palms, broken fingernails.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.166
They had a series of assaults
in the park that summer.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.792
Mother said she was a tomboy

06:14.875 --> 06:17.125
but it looks like she went
parking with the wrong guy.

06:17.208 --> 06:18.500
Ah, you could fill a book
with the things

06:18.583 --> 06:21.125
teenage girls
don't tell their mothers.

06:21.208 --> 06:22.709
The mother Simone
was a legal secretary

06:22.792 --> 06:25.250
worked until 2:00 a.m.
that night.

06:25.333 --> 06:28.250
Well, Missy had gone to the
rink
with a girl named Julie Reed.

06:28.333 --> 06:31.542
They split up around 10:00,
but no one saw her take off.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.583
That leaves two hours
unaccounted for.

06:33.667 --> 06:34.834
'Anything could have happened.'

06:34.917 --> 06:37.208
The blue fibers found
on the body.

06:37.291 --> 06:38.959
Looked like carpet.

06:39.041 --> 06:41.500
Could be shag
from the spaceship van?

06:41.583 --> 06:43.291
It was the '70s.

06:43.375 --> 06:44.709
They save her nail clippings?

06:46.041 --> 06:47.959
It looks like, but no DNA

06:48.041 --> 06:50.291
'in '78, so they
couldn't test them.'

06:50.375 --> 06:52.625
Hmm. Let's get them
from Evidence

06:52.709 --> 06:54.458
send them to the lab.

06:54.542 --> 06:57.041
We got science
on our side now.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.208
(Simone)
My daughter never would
have gone to the park

06:59.291 --> 07:00.500
with some stranger.

07:00.583 --> 07:03.291
Missy wasn't who
they made her out to be.

07:03.375 --> 07:05.500
Well, we're not here to judge
your daughter, Mrs. Gallavan.

07:05.583 --> 07:07.959
I know what the police
and everybody else
thought.

07:08.041 --> 07:11.000
Well, we're looking into a
possible new lead on her
murder.

07:11.083 --> 07:14.542
'Did you or Missy know anyone
with a customized van?'

07:14.625 --> 07:16.542
Why, you think someone
with a van hurt Missy?

07:16.625 --> 07:19.792
Maybe someone she went to
school
with? From the neighborhood?

07:19.875 --> 07:23.208
I didn't really know
anybody
in the neighborhood.

07:23.291 --> 07:24.542
After my husband
and I split up

07:24.625 --> 07:26.291
Missy and I moved
into an apartment

07:26.375 --> 07:28.208
in Mayfair that summer.

07:28.291 --> 07:29.834
Was Missy's father
in the picture?

07:29.917 --> 07:34.250
He took off for California
with his dental hygienist.

07:34.333 --> 07:37.959
Wanted a fresh start.
I went back to work.

07:38.041 --> 07:41.125
Missy told you she was going
to the rink with a friend?

07:41.208 --> 07:42.959
I trusted my daughter.

07:43.041 --> 07:44.625
Missy knew if she
couldn't
get a ride home

07:44.709 --> 07:46.542
she could call
and I'd come and pick her
up.

07:46.625 --> 07:49.000
Did she ever call that night?

07:49.083 --> 07:51.875
It's the first time I
let her
go with that Julie.

07:51.959 --> 07:54.417
- And look what happened.
- Julie Reed?

07:54.500 --> 07:55.875
Missy had met her
a couple of weeks

07:55.959 --> 07:58.917
before at the
apartment complex.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.208
never

08:01.291 --> 08:02.709
get mixed up
with a girl like that.

08:18.959 --> 08:20.583
I've seen you at the rink.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.250
- You're pretty good.
- Thanks.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.834
- Can you "shoot the moon?"
- I'm more of a fast skater.

08:25.917 --> 08:30.375
I could maybe show you
a few things, if you
wanted.

08:30.458 --> 08:31.583
Sure.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.083
Once you know
some spins and stuff

08:33.166 --> 08:34.875
we can go to the rink at night.

08:34.959 --> 08:37.750
The real action
happens after nine.

08:37.834 --> 08:39.083
Oh, that's for over 18.

08:39.166 --> 08:40.417
I'm only 15.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.250
They won't let me in.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.500
They will
if you're with me.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.500
I have connections.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.417
You know, you could be pretty
if you wore a little makeup

08:52.500 --> 08:54.250
played up your eyes.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.750
Oh, I'm really bad
at all that.

08:56.834 --> 08:59.458
Lucky for you, I'm an expert.

08:59.542 --> 09:01.875
We're about the same size.
I could lend you clothes.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.333
What's wrong with my clothes?

09:05.041 --> 09:07.917
By the time I'm done,
you won't recognize yourself.

09:11.792 --> 09:15.125
Julie was, uh, fast.
A lot of attitude.

09:15.208 --> 09:17.667
She told detectives she was
at the rink with Missy

09:17.750 --> 09:19.083
before they got split up.

09:19.166 --> 09:21.500
Yeah, that's what
she said, alright.

09:23.208 --> 09:25.792
Some friend
she turned out to
be.

09:28.625 --> 09:30.000
(Kat)
'Uh-uh, no way.'

09:30.083 --> 09:32.083
Last time you hooked me up
the guy wore flip-flops

09:32.166 --> 09:33.500
and forgot his wallet.

09:33.583 --> 09:35.625
- Onions?
- Sure.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.250
No, Mom,
I'm not talking to you.

09:37.333 --> 09:38.917
- Cheese?
- Heart attack special.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.667
- Heart attack.
- Okay, okay, fine.

09:40.750 --> 09:44.667
- Thanks, Jake.
- But you're babysitting.

09:45.875 --> 09:46.875
What?

09:46.959 --> 09:48.458
My mother met
some guy at church

09:48.542 --> 09:50.917
and now I have a
date
tomorrow night.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.166
That a bad thing?

09:52.250 --> 09:54.250
You ever had
a good blind
date?

09:54.333 --> 09:55.333
I don't do blind dates.

09:55.417 --> 09:57.875
I like to see
what I'm getting into.

09:57.959 --> 09:59.792
Yeah, me, too.

09:59.875 --> 10:01.583
I talked to a buddy
in Narcotics.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.458
Most of the guys that
detailed vans in the '70s

10:03.542 --> 10:06.667
are tattoo artists
or T-shirt airbrushers now.

10:06.750 --> 10:09.166
What kind of loser paints
a spaceship on their car?

10:09.250 --> 10:10.625
Oh, it was the '70s.

10:10.709 --> 10:14.250
"Star Wars", that Boston
album,
Parliament-Funkadelic.

10:14.333 --> 10:17.333
Uh-uh, brothers were not
painting spaceships on
vans.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.667
Not anymore.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.166
Those guys got your mom
down at church

10:20.250 --> 10:22.166
setting them up
on blind dates now.

10:22.250 --> 10:23.583
See, now, that
was uncalled
for.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.792
(Vera)
'Pretty isolated up here,
especially at night.'

10:27.875 --> 10:29.750
Just that one
streetlight
up on the road.

10:29.834 --> 10:31.875
The string of assaults
on the park in '78.

10:31.959 --> 10:34.125
Everyone knew not
to come here after dark.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.709
Tell a teenager
not to do
something

10:35.792 --> 10:37.083
it just makes
them
want do it more.

10:37.166 --> 10:38.750
Yeah, so say she meets
a guy at the rink.

10:38.834 --> 10:41.792
They get in his van,
come here for some quality
time.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.458
Things start to heat up.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.917
Or don't get as
hot
as he wants it.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.667
(Jeffries)
'She fights back
and he blows a fuse.'

10:48.750 --> 10:50.583
Tosses her over the edge.

10:50.667 --> 10:52.542
Done and done.

10:52.625 --> 10:55.041
Or she gets out of the
car,
starts to run..

10:55.125 --> 10:57.417
It's dark, she can't see
where the pavement ends..

10:57.500 --> 11:00.959
Wham, she hits the wall,
topples over.

11:01.041 --> 11:02.583
Humpty Dumpty..

11:02.667 --> 11:04.041
One nasty fall.

11:08.500 --> 11:12.500
Yeah. You do any artwork on
vans
back in the '70s?

11:13.709 --> 11:14.875
Yeah, right.

11:14.959 --> 11:18.667
I am sure your sunsets
would rock my world, sir

11:18.750 --> 11:22.542
but I'm only interested
in spaceships.

11:22.625 --> 11:25.166
I talked to 33
guys.
Not jack squat.

11:25.250 --> 11:27.709
[sighs]
Oh, dudes smoked out
all their brain cells.

11:27.792 --> 11:30.333
Yeah, uh, Rufus?

11:30.417 --> 11:33.000
'Uh, you do any artwork
on vans back in the '70s?'

11:33.083 --> 11:35.333
Yeah?
Spaceships?

11:35.417 --> 11:37.709
- You're kidding.
- I got to go run an errand.

11:37.792 --> 11:40.500
- Hair appointment, right?
- You better quit now.

11:43.792 --> 11:45.542
Uh, yeah, Rufus?

11:49.166 --> 11:51.000
How long were you
and Missy friends, Julie?

11:51.083 --> 11:54.083
Uh, just a few
weeks
before that night.

11:54.166 --> 11:56.834
She'd just
moved
into the
building.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.250
Your idea to go to the rink
that night, adult skate?

11:59.333 --> 12:01.959
I had a lot
of bad ideas back
then.

12:02.041 --> 12:05.125
I'm sure you remember 15.

12:05.208 --> 12:07.125
- Is that you?
- 'My daughter, Tiffany.'

12:07.208 --> 12:09.792
'Can't get enough
of that retro fashion.'

12:09.875 --> 12:11.083
Uniforms on, girls!

12:11.166 --> 12:14.166
We leave for practice
in ten minutes.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.583
Run a pretty tight ship.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.125
Idle hands, right?

12:18.208 --> 12:20.000
If they're busy,
they can't get into
trouble.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.458
Do you remember any guys
who showed

12:21.542 --> 12:22.667
interest in Missy that night?

12:22.750 --> 12:24.500
Lots of guys.
She was a cute girl.

12:24.583 --> 12:29.500
Any drove a customized van,
a spaceship painted on the
side?

12:29.583 --> 12:32.000
Spaceship. No.

12:32.083 --> 12:33.208
Stoners weren't really my scene.

12:33.291 --> 12:34.959
Well, what was
your scene, Julie?

12:35.041 --> 12:36.083
'Anywhere I could get in.'

12:36.166 --> 12:38.291
I knew how to handle myself.

12:38.375 --> 12:40.458
But it was all still
pretty fresh for
Missy.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.291
How'd you two get separated
that night?

12:42.375 --> 12:45.875
Met a cute guy. Got distracted.

12:45.959 --> 12:48.625
I know her mother still
blames me for what happened.

12:51.375 --> 12:52.667
Truth is, I was the kind of girl

12:52.750 --> 12:55.667
I try to keep
my daughters away from.

13:00.750 --> 13:01.959
It's amazing.

13:02.041 --> 13:04.625
Totally different
than daytime.

13:04.709 --> 13:06.000
Daytime's for kids.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.834
You want a man,
not a boy,
right?

13:07.917 --> 13:12.667
[laughs]
I'm...not really sure
about the whole dating thing.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.542
Try it.
You'll like
it.

13:14.625 --> 13:17.375
I'm still getting used
to my mom dating.

13:17.458 --> 13:20.208
You ever miss your dad?

13:20.291 --> 13:21.208
Not much to miss.

13:21.291 --> 13:22.458
Last time I saw him we went

13:22.542 --> 13:25.041
to Wanamaker's to see Santa.

13:25.125 --> 13:26.417
I think I was four.

13:31.959 --> 13:33.667
There's a lot
of talent here
tonight.

13:35.125 --> 13:37.333
Now, if a guy grabs your
hips
during "Loco-Motion. "

13:37.417 --> 13:38.917
- That means he's into you.
- Okay.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.375
And if he asks what you do,
just say, "taking some
classes."

13:42.458 --> 13:45.000
It makes you sound
older,
and it's sort of true.

13:45.083 --> 13:47.375
- Smart.
- I know, right?

13:47.458 --> 13:48.875
And don't worry
if you get nervous

13:48.959 --> 13:50.542
or run out of things to say.

13:50.625 --> 13:52.875
Just flip your hair.
Guys think it's sexy.

13:52.959 --> 13:54.834
Like this?

13:54.917 --> 13:56.625
Perfect.

14:28.125 --> 14:31.250
Summer night,
just out looking for fun.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.834
Turned out to be
the worst night of my life.

14:32.917 --> 14:35.250
Who was the guy
getting
handsy with Missy?

14:35.333 --> 14:36.834
Rick, the DJ.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.375
(Julie)
'He was, like a local
celebrity.
We were friends.'

14:39.458 --> 14:41.458
DJ's friends
with 15-year-old
girls?

14:41.542 --> 14:43.208
He would get us
into the over 18

14:43.291 --> 14:44.792
let us hang out
in his booth.

14:44.875 --> 14:48.583
- He was harmless.
- Rick's DJ booth.

14:48.667 --> 14:50.125
Shag carpet?

14:50.208 --> 14:52.583
It was the '70's. What else?

15:04.583 --> 15:06.667
Tragic what happened
to that girl.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.291
(Rick)
'I heard she was some skater.'

15:08.375 --> 15:10.792
You remember letting her into
the adult skate, Rick?

15:10.875 --> 15:12.709
Hey, the outfits
those girls wore

15:12.792 --> 15:14.291
they could go
wherever
they wanted.

15:14.375 --> 15:16.750
That why you decided to do
the "Loco-Motion" with her?

15:16.834 --> 15:18.291
I was the DJ.

15:18.375 --> 15:22.417
I always came out and
grabbed
a body for that song.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.875
Never heard a lady complain.

15:23.959 --> 15:25.542
The way I heard it,
you had your share

15:25.625 --> 15:28.000
of underage groupies doing time
in your DJ booth.

15:28.083 --> 15:29.500
They all looked 18 to me.

15:29.583 --> 15:32.500
A player like you, I bet you
had
a sweet ride back then.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.542
Maybe a cool,
customized van?

15:34.625 --> 15:36.500
No. I was an AMX man.

15:36.583 --> 15:40.250
It was a fast ride,
and the seats fully
reclined.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.000
What time did you
leave the rink?

15:45.083 --> 15:46.166
I didn't,
I stayed there all
night

15:46.250 --> 15:47.375
with some
friends,
partying.

15:47.458 --> 15:49.000
These friends,
are gonna back that up?

15:49.083 --> 15:51.917
Yeah, it may take a while, but
I
can probably track 'em down.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.542
How about you toss me
your digits

15:53.625 --> 15:55.792
and I'll call you
with their info?

15:55.875 --> 15:57.000
How about you give me
their names

15:57.083 --> 15:58.333
and leave the detective work
to me?

15:58.417 --> 16:00.667
Sure you never gave Missy
a spin in your booth?

16:00.750 --> 16:04.375
Come on. There were so many
girls back then, I lost
count.

16:04.458 --> 16:07.250
Oh, let me refresh your memory.

16:07.333 --> 16:10.041
You skated with her and she
wound up dead a few hours
later.

16:10.125 --> 16:14.375
Whoa. I'm a lover,
not a killer, baby.

16:14.458 --> 16:16.875
Yeah. Look, she was cute.

16:16.959 --> 16:18.458
I might have grabbed her.

16:18.542 --> 16:21.458
But this girl had someone else
on her tail that night.

16:24.125 --> 16:28.083
- 'What's your sign?'
- Um, Pisces.

16:28.166 --> 16:30.291
You are one foxy little fish.

16:34.125 --> 16:36.625
- What the hell, man?
<i>man.</i>

16:36.709 --> 16:38.875
You touch me again, and I'll
rearrange your face, kid.

16:38.959 --> 16:41.291
Hey, what are you doing here?

16:41.375 --> 16:42.667
I called your house.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.208
Some guy said you'd be here.

16:44.291 --> 16:45.583
What are you wearing?

16:45.667 --> 16:46.917
Your face is all shiny.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.750
It's glitter makeup.

16:48.834 --> 16:50.041
Brings out my eyes.

16:50.125 --> 16:51.667
Look, Missy,
you shouldn't be here.

16:51.750 --> 16:54.208
The guys are all pervy and old.

16:54.291 --> 16:55.583
Anyway, where have you been?

16:55.667 --> 16:56.834
(Hugh)
You haven't come
to Fast Skate in weeks.

16:56.917 --> 16:59.125
Julie's been teaching
me
some new tricks.

16:59.208 --> 17:02.166
- I can shoot the moon.
- Shoot the moon?

17:02.250 --> 17:03.542
What about the Olympics, huh?

17:03.625 --> 17:05.250
Or are you too cool
for that now?

17:05.333 --> 17:10.750
Just...leave me alone,
Hugh.
Would you?

17:17.667 --> 17:18.834
Sure, I could
have
taken the guy

17:18.917 --> 17:20.667
but he seemed jacked
on something.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.542
Did you see him with Missy
later that night?

17:22.625 --> 17:25.291
No, but then again, I wasn't
exactly keeping tabs on her.

17:25.375 --> 17:26.625
I don't need
those reindeer
games.

17:26.709 --> 17:28.583
Of course not. You were
king of the rink, huh?

17:28.667 --> 17:31.875
You know it. We do a '70s
night
here on Saturdays.

17:31.959 --> 17:34.291
It's off the hook.
You should come by.

17:34.375 --> 17:37.041
Give you
the special VIP
treatment.

17:39.250 --> 17:42.000
So I go down to Evidence to
pick
up Missy's nail clippings.

17:42.083 --> 17:44.959
Mr. Happy Meal behind
the counter keeps
stonewalling

17:45.041 --> 17:46.291
finding reasons why
I can't have them.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.792
I know that guy.
Loves

17:48.875 --> 17:50.625
We go in
circles
for an hour.

17:50.709 --> 17:53.291
Finally, he admits
the box holding
them

17:53.375 --> 17:54.959
get this, four rows back.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.500
Well, hey, that's gotta
be ten, 12 feet.

17:56.583 --> 18:00.208
Oh, he's not going to waddle
his fast food self all that
way.

18:00.291 --> 18:01.542
Afraid the
Hamburglar
will grab him.

18:01.625 --> 18:02.875
(Vera)
'Unbelievable.'

18:02.959 --> 18:04.834
Finally, went and got
the damn box myself.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.250
We locate that other kid
from the rink yet?

18:07.333 --> 18:08.834
(Vera)
'Hugh Mastersen.'

18:08.917 --> 18:10.500
Grew up in her old neighborhood.

18:10.583 --> 18:14.500
I can't decide whether this
guy's creepy or just plain
sad.

18:14.583 --> 18:16.291
Pulled up his MySpace page.

18:16.375 --> 18:18.500
Single male in his 40s,
never married.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.834
Still looking
for that special connection.

18:20.917 --> 18:22.458
Cross-check him
with vehicle registration?

18:22.542 --> 18:24.709
I don't even think he had
a learner's permit back in
'78,

18:24.792 --> 18:26.667
but he did call
the house that night

18:26.750 --> 18:27.875
asking for Missy.

18:27.959 --> 18:29.750
Some guy answered,
said she was at the rink.

18:29.834 --> 18:32.333
- The mother aware of this?
- Got a call in to Simone.

18:32.417 --> 18:34.542
Going through old statements,
boyfriends.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.750
If there's a man with a van,
we'll find him.

18:36.834 --> 18:38.291
Any progress
on those nail clippings?

18:38.375 --> 18:40.375
At the lab now,
being tested for
DNA.

18:40.458 --> 18:43.041
Will put a hurtin'
on Mr. Happy Meal.

18:52.417 --> 18:56.000
(Valens)
'Hey. Get your nails done,
killer?'

18:56.083 --> 18:58.500
Shut up.

18:58.583 --> 19:01.542
So, where are you kids
headed tonight?

19:01.625 --> 19:02.667
Think I'm gonna cancel.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.875
The regular
dating's
hard enough.

19:04.959 --> 19:06.667
For a single mom,
it's impossible.

19:06.750 --> 19:09.125
Yeah, why bother?

19:09.208 --> 19:11.166
Get yourself some sweatpants

19:11.250 --> 19:12.208
park it on the couch.

19:12.291 --> 19:13.542
You make it sound so bad.

19:13.625 --> 19:14.583
Oh, you'll go toe-to-toe

19:14.667 --> 19:15.917
with some jacked-up gangbanger

19:16.000 --> 19:17.542
but you're afraid
of a little blind date

19:17.625 --> 19:19.208
your mom's met at church?

19:19.291 --> 19:20.834
Sorry about that, Cat told me

19:20.917 --> 19:22.750
'to ink his girl's name
across his back.'

19:22.834 --> 19:24.166
'Sheryl with an "S ."'

19:24.250 --> 19:25.834
Turns out she spells
it with a "C".

19:25.917 --> 19:27.250
Well, talk spaceships, Rufus.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.875
Said on the phone you
remember spraying one

19:28.959 --> 19:29.917
on a van back in the day?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.625
Yeah, cat was a big Boston fan.

19:31.709 --> 19:34.083
Thought they were gonna
be the next Stones.

19:34.166 --> 19:36.250
So much for his crystal-balling.

19:36.333 --> 19:40.083
I keep my old stuff in here
for inspiration.

19:40.166 --> 19:41.583
You remember the guy's name?

19:41.667 --> 19:44.000
Just called him Boston.

19:44.083 --> 19:47.625
You got great skin.
Make an excellent canvas.

19:47.709 --> 19:50.125
'Yeah, here it is.'

19:53.542 --> 19:56.542
Huh. Thanks, Rufus.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.750
We'll try to get
this back to you.

19:58.834 --> 20:00.625
- 'Are we good?'
- Yeah, we're good.

20:06.041 --> 20:07.917
Yeah, Missy and I grew up
on the same block.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.917
We were skate buddies
since kindergarten.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.792
Oh, sounds like you two
had a real connection.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.458
(Hugh)
'The Missy I knew was a
tomboy.'

20:14.542 --> 20:17.917
She used to talk about
training for the
Olympics.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.083
(Rush)
'The guy who answered
the phone at Missy's place'

20:20.166 --> 20:21.458
told you she was at the rink?

20:21.542 --> 20:22.667
Did you recognize his voice?

20:22.750 --> 20:24.041
Figured it was
her mom's
boyfriend.

20:24.125 --> 20:25.166
Didn't occur to you
to mention that

20:25.250 --> 20:26.542
to the police in '78?

20:26.625 --> 20:28.625
Well, the papers said
some creep picked her
up

20:28.709 --> 20:31.709
in the park, but I
take it
you already know
that.

20:31.792 --> 20:33.500
Saw your MySpace page, Hugh.

20:33.583 --> 20:36.625
Still looking
for that special connection?

20:37.709 --> 20:38.834
Who isn't?

20:38.917 --> 20:39.959
Well, you seemed
pretty particular

20:40.041 --> 20:41.000
to Missy back in the day.

20:41.083 --> 20:42.333
I told you we were friends.

20:42.417 --> 20:44.792
Going after her
and the guy she's with..

20:44.875 --> 20:46.792
...isn't really
friend behavior, is it?

20:46.875 --> 20:48.417
That DJ was a creep.

20:48.500 --> 20:49.667
Hmm, no argument here,

20:49.750 --> 20:51.375
but you were angry with her.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.500
I wasn't mad at her.
I was worried about
her.

20:53.583 --> 20:54.959
Funny way of showing it.

20:55.041 --> 20:58.458
When Missy moved away,
she just fell off the
map.

20:58.542 --> 21:01.417
When I finally see her
again,
the way she looked..

21:01.500 --> 21:03.542
...it just wasn't her.

21:11.250 --> 21:12.625
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:12.709 --> 21:18.000
Um...look, I'm,
I'm really sorry about before.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.834
I, I haven't heard from you
since you moved.

21:19.917 --> 21:22.291
I was gonna
call
you, but..

21:22.375 --> 21:24.458
...things have been
kind of messed up.

21:24.542 --> 21:28.000
My mom works all the time.

21:28.083 --> 21:31.000
And she's got
this slimy
boyfriend.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.166
He's always around.

21:32.250 --> 21:36.375
This guy, did he do something?

21:36.458 --> 21:39.041
Missy, it's me. I mean,
you can tell me anything.

21:41.458 --> 21:43.125
The other night..

21:45.166 --> 21:47.500
...we were watching TV..

21:47.583 --> 21:52.709
...and he...he touched my hair.

21:55.834 --> 21:57.208
It creeped me out.

22:00.333 --> 22:01.959
What are you going
to do about it?

22:02.041 --> 22:03.417
Stay out of his way.

22:06.625 --> 22:09.709
So, what have you
been doing all Summer?

22:09.792 --> 22:11.875
Well, I found this new place.

22:11.959 --> 22:14.083
You're gonna love it.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.291
We can go now
if you want to, on my bike.

22:16.375 --> 22:17.959
Tear it up like we used to.

22:18.041 --> 22:19.709
I promised Julie I'd
do
the dance contest

22:19.792 --> 22:20.959
with her later.

22:21.041 --> 22:24.125
But I can come
by your house
tomorrow.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.333
We'll start training then.

22:27.417 --> 22:28.750
Okay.

22:34.083 --> 22:35.583
I waited on my
front steps all
day

22:35.667 --> 22:36.750
but she just never showed.

22:36.834 --> 22:38.250
What'd you do
after you left Missy?

22:38.333 --> 22:39.750
Rode my bike home,
I had to get up at
five

22:39.834 --> 22:41.917
in the morning
for my paper
route.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.917
Pretty much
quit skating after
that.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.166
It just wasn't
the same without
Missy.

22:50.166 --> 22:51.917
(Scotty)
'Plates from the van
came back registered'

22:52.000 --> 22:53.583
to a Joe Bosquay.

22:53.667 --> 22:54.667
(John)
'He got a sheet?'

22:54.750 --> 22:57.125
Uh, that name, Bosquay..

22:59.542 --> 23:02.166
In '91, his 16 year
old step daughter

23:02.250 --> 23:03.709
charged him
with sexual assault.

23:03.792 --> 23:06.166
- The charges were dropped
but..
- Where there's smoke..

23:06.250 --> 23:09.542
And Joe Bosquay
alibied out in
'78.

23:09.625 --> 23:10.959
Jacuzzi salesman.

23:11.041 --> 23:12.792
- Dated the mother.
- Simone's boyfriend.

23:12.875 --> 23:15.750
Oh, Simone backed him up,
said he wasn't around.

23:15.834 --> 23:17.166
Yeah, well, we got 30 years
of history

23:17.250 --> 23:18.583
since then not backing Joe up.

23:18.667 --> 23:21.083
Now, according to Hugh,
the guy was putting the moves

23:21.166 --> 23:23.083
on Missy a few
days before she
died.

23:23.166 --> 23:24.333
Hmm, Bring him in?

23:24.417 --> 23:25.750
The mother, too.
Maybe she knows more

23:25.834 --> 23:27.417
than she's been letting on.

23:28.625 --> 23:30.166
Homicide. Stillman.

23:30.250 --> 23:31.458
Just a minute.

23:33.709 --> 23:37.000
It's Miller...and she's
pretending to be someone else.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.625
She sounds drunk.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.667
Miller? You sure?

23:40.750 --> 23:42.458
She's asking for you, Scotty.

23:50.750 --> 23:52.750
Get in, lush.

23:55.417 --> 23:58.250
I would've called a cab,
but I was late

23:58.333 --> 24:00.000
left the house
without my wallet.

24:00.083 --> 24:02.667
- So, what's wrong with the
guy?
- Nothing.

24:02.750 --> 24:07.500
Good-looking, manners,
ordered a nice bottle of
wine.

24:07.583 --> 24:10.417
'I just drank half of it
before the calamari came.'

24:10.500 --> 24:13.083
Ah, you were nervous.
It's a rookie mistake.

24:13.166 --> 24:16.667
I don't have the time
or energy for the game.

24:16.750 --> 24:17.917
Bring on the sweatpants.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.500
You, you say
goodbye to him

24:19.583 --> 24:23.500
or just go to the
bathroom,
never come back?

24:23.583 --> 24:25.375
Oh, that's cold, man.

24:27.625 --> 24:29.041
You got to
call
him tomorrow

24:29.125 --> 24:31.500
and make up some kind
of work emergency.

24:31.583 --> 24:33.166
Mmm-mm, I'm not calling him.

24:33.250 --> 24:36.000
This was a one-shot deal.
One and done.

24:36.083 --> 24:37.208
Aw, come on, Kat.

24:37.291 --> 24:38.792
You got to get
back in the
game.

24:38.875 --> 24:40.667
[sighs]
Got no game, baby.

24:40.750 --> 24:42.208
- Game over.
- Shame.

24:42.291 --> 24:45.083
You're still
a pretty good
catch.

24:45.166 --> 24:46.542
- Yeah?
- Just saying.

24:46.625 --> 24:49.083
You deserve more.

24:49.166 --> 24:50.375
Damn straight.

24:50.458 --> 24:53.000
Lousy-ass cop, though.

24:53.083 --> 24:56.542
Take me home before
I puke all over your car.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.417
You got it.

25:11.542 --> 25:13.750
(Simone)
'Joe Bosquay.'

25:13.834 --> 25:15.917
That's a name I'd rather forget.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.250
But he was
your boyfriend?

25:18.333 --> 25:20.417
Not for long.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.250
He was just the first
guy
to look at me

25:22.333 --> 25:23.750
after my husband left.

25:23.834 --> 25:26.667
Turns out I wasn't
a very good judge of
character.

25:26.750 --> 25:28.583
You didn't tell us
he drove a van.

25:28.667 --> 25:29.959
Big spaceship on it.

25:30.041 --> 25:31.667
He didn't drive a van.

25:31.750 --> 25:34.750
- He drove a convertible.
- You sure about that?

25:34.834 --> 25:36.709
He kept the top
down
all the time.

25:36.792 --> 25:39.542
I had to wear a scarf to keep
my hair from blowing around.

25:39.625 --> 25:42.083
The van was registered
to Joe's business.

25:45.625 --> 25:48.291
I've never seen it before.

25:48.375 --> 25:49.750
Why?

25:53.458 --> 25:55.458
Was Joe ever home
when you weren't?

25:55.542 --> 25:56.959
No.

25:57.041 --> 25:58.291
Not that I know of.

25:58.375 --> 26:00.792
Did he have a key
to your apartment?

26:00.875 --> 26:02.000
No.

26:02.083 --> 26:03.834
Ever keep an extra key
outside your door

26:03.917 --> 26:05.000
maybe for Missy?

26:08.834 --> 26:10.417
Oh, my God.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.291
You don't think..

26:15.750 --> 26:17.208
(Nick)
'You ever been
arrested, Joe?'

26:17.291 --> 26:18.208
Nope.

26:18.291 --> 26:19.417
My record's clean.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.125
Only because your
stepdaughter Celeste

26:21.208 --> 26:23.208
didn't proceed with
her case against you.

26:23.291 --> 26:25.250
Bitch was a liar.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.083
It was his van.

26:27.166 --> 26:28.917
And Joe picked up
Missy at the rink.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.125
No, no, no,
th-that's not
possible.

26:31.208 --> 26:32.333
I-I would have known.

26:32.417 --> 26:33.625
We have an eyewitness, Simone.

26:33.709 --> 26:37.625
God, I brought
that man into my
house.

26:37.709 --> 26:40.625
(Vera)
'DA said Celeste's mother
pressured her to walk away.'

26:40.709 --> 26:43.667
You had her convinced you were
some kind of Prince Charming.

26:43.750 --> 26:45.250
So much for maternal instinct.

26:45.333 --> 26:48.166
Fibers found on Missy's body
came back from the lab.

26:48.250 --> 26:49.709
American Blue shag.

26:49.792 --> 26:52.750
One of the options
offered
on the '76 Chevy Van 20.

26:52.834 --> 26:55.542
Perfect match
for your model
van.

26:55.625 --> 26:58.041
I never touched Missy.

26:58.125 --> 27:00.291
Missy ever try to talk
to you about Joe?

27:01.959 --> 27:04.500
She...she..

27:04.583 --> 27:08.542
...told me something once.

27:08.625 --> 27:11.583
A-a day or two
before she died,
but..

27:11.667 --> 27:14.208
But what, Simone?

27:14.291 --> 27:17.208
I thought it was
about something
else.

27:21.417 --> 27:23.417
Look! It's called
"Shoot the moon."

27:23.500 --> 27:24.875
That's terrific!

27:24.959 --> 27:27.041
Oh, you should come
to the rink with me sometime.

27:27.125 --> 27:29.542
Oh, we'd have so much fun.

27:29.625 --> 27:31.458
Maybe Joe could come, too.

27:31.542 --> 27:35.959
He's a great dancer. I bet
he's a great skater, too.

27:36.041 --> 27:37.834
Do you think
Joe really loves you?

27:37.917 --> 27:41.667
The way you and dad
loved each other.

27:41.750 --> 27:43.041
Before?

27:45.125 --> 27:47.000
Oh, honey.

27:47.083 --> 27:50.250
Your dad...
he's not coming
back.

27:51.875 --> 27:53.834
I know that.

27:55.834 --> 27:58.375
You've had a lot to
adjust to this
summer.

27:58.458 --> 28:00.417
And you have been
such a trooper.

28:00.500 --> 28:05.709
But you and me,
we're a family.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.125
We don't need anyone else.
Right?

28:09.208 --> 28:11.709
Nobody will ever
replace your dad.

28:11.792 --> 28:14.375
But whoever it is I'm dating,
you have to give him a chance.

28:14.458 --> 28:18.959
I know, and I did, but
Joe's not the guy for you,
Mom.

28:19.041 --> 28:21.250
You are too picky, honey.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.375
Maybe you're not picky enough.

28:31.750 --> 28:34.542
I just thought
she missed her
father.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.250
She was trying
not to hurt your feelings.

28:37.333 --> 28:38.875
It's all my fault.

28:40.917 --> 28:42.333
That bastard!

28:43.875 --> 28:45.959
You were in
the apartment that
night.

28:46.041 --> 28:47.125
- You answered the phone.
- So?

28:47.208 --> 28:48.667
Missy wanted a ride home.

28:48.750 --> 28:51.291
Which you never told her mother
or the cops back then?

28:51.375 --> 28:53.959
The kid ended up
dead that night.

28:54.041 --> 28:56.542
- It would have looked bad.
- Because it was bad!

28:56.625 --> 28:58.625
You picked her up at the
rink
took her to the park!

28:58.709 --> 29:02.125
No! She never went
anywhere with me.

29:22.834 --> 29:24.041
Where's my mom?

29:26.333 --> 29:27.500
Where'd you get this van?

29:27.583 --> 29:28.834
She's still at work.

29:28.917 --> 29:30.166
I really need her right now.

29:30.250 --> 29:33.333
Yeah, well...you got me.

29:36.583 --> 29:39.166
Come on.
I need your help inside.

29:39.250 --> 29:40.333
Alright.

29:43.166 --> 29:45.959
I brought help. We're going
to get you out of here.

29:46.041 --> 29:48.583
Do you have any idea
how young these girls are?

29:48.667 --> 29:49.917
- This is not cool.
- Look, man, I--

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
This is not cool at all.

29:52.083 --> 29:54.000
I wouldn't want to be you
if the cops get wind of this.

29:54.083 --> 29:56.417
If somebody gave them
the wrong impression.

29:59.125 --> 30:02.208
Maybe this will
keep you quiet?

30:02.291 --> 30:04.625
Julie can stay
till she sleeps it
off?

30:04.709 --> 30:06.500
And then we'll all
forget this ever
happened.

30:06.583 --> 30:08.792
Forget what?
Let's scram, Missy.

30:08.875 --> 30:09.875
I got people to see.

30:09.959 --> 30:11.458
Aren't you going
to do something?

30:11.542 --> 30:14.041
- Let's go.
- I'm not leaving Julie
alone.

30:14.125 --> 30:16.542
I am not going
anywhere with you.

30:16.625 --> 30:18.542
You're disgusting.

30:18.625 --> 30:20.208
You don't want to come,
that's your deal

30:20.291 --> 30:24.458
but, uh, I don't think your
mom
is gonna to be too thrilled

30:24.542 --> 30:25.709
at how you're
spending your time.

30:25.792 --> 30:28.291
I guess now
you and I have a secret.

30:33.417 --> 30:34.834
They were Rick's problem
after that.

30:34.917 --> 30:37.208
I mean, I didn't need
that kind of headache.

30:37.291 --> 30:38.875
Where did you go
after you left the
rink?

30:38.959 --> 30:41.667
I went to my friend Anita's.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.709
That, uh, lady loved her
some nose candy.

30:45.792 --> 30:48.041
It made her real grateful.

30:48.125 --> 30:49.834
More grateful than Simone?

30:49.917 --> 30:51.792
Simone wasn't around.

30:51.875 --> 30:53.750
A man has needs.

30:53.834 --> 30:57.000
I'm torn, Joe.

30:57.083 --> 31:00.375
I can't decide if you're too
old
for me to feed you your
teeth.

31:16.542 --> 31:17.875
Miss Gallavan.

31:22.625 --> 31:24.000
You were supplying drugs
to minors.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.583
Trying to get over
on underage girls.

31:25.667 --> 31:27.000
- I didn't--
- You lied, Rick.

31:27.083 --> 31:28.417
You did see Missy
again that night.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.625
Her friend Julie was high
as a kite, thanks to you.

31:30.709 --> 31:32.417
So you made sure
Missy stayed silent.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.625
Whoa!

31:34.709 --> 31:39.166
The last time I saw those
girls,
they were very much alive.

31:41.625 --> 31:43.291
She's freezing, Rick.

31:43.375 --> 31:44.667
She needs a doctor!

31:44.750 --> 31:48.125
Uh, what's-what's going on?

31:48.208 --> 31:49.291
Your friend
brought her old
man.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.417
That's what's going on.

31:51.500 --> 31:53.333
Look, I want you
two brats out now!

31:53.417 --> 31:55.583
And don't even think
about coming back.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.333
I didn't kill that girl.

32:00.417 --> 32:03.917
I just wanted her to
take
her friend and go
home!

32:04.000 --> 32:05.500
You saying Missy left
with Julie?

32:05.583 --> 32:08.250
Gave her
that roller-skating jacket.

32:08.333 --> 32:11.083
She was cleaning up my mess.
Guess I owe her a thanks.

32:11.166 --> 32:13.333
Sure you're done
jerking us around, Rick?

32:13.417 --> 32:15.417
- Nothing else?
- That's all I got.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.208
Talk to Julie.

32:17.291 --> 32:20.041
- Good. We will.
- What the hell?

32:20.125 --> 32:21.667
You got six
outstanding tickets

32:21.750 --> 32:23.667
for moving violations
in Potter County.

32:23.750 --> 32:24.709
Tickets?

32:24.792 --> 32:26.500
Well, 1,400 bucks ain't no joke.

32:26.583 --> 32:29.166
Potter County PD's on their
way
downstate to pick you up.

32:29.250 --> 32:31.291
Long drive.
Could take all night.

32:31.375 --> 32:33.208
See if we can find
a nice big cellmate

32:33.291 --> 32:34.667
you can
do the Locomotion with.

32:34.750 --> 32:35.917
Who's the foxy fish now?

32:38.917 --> 32:40.417
Julie's been
marinating for a
while.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.625
Should be about ready
to talk now.

32:43.667 --> 32:44.917
Tell her you'd
be right there?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.125
Yup, about an hour ago.

32:47.208 --> 32:48.250
Nice.

32:48.333 --> 32:49.375
So, you call him?

32:49.458 --> 32:51.000
What are you now,
my life coach?

32:51.083 --> 32:52.917
Apparently,
I'm your driver.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.542
Never living that down.

32:54.625 --> 32:57.625
- Call him.
- Why am I here?

32:57.709 --> 32:59.834
I told you everything I
knew
when you were at my house.

32:59.917 --> 33:01.291
Except the part
about you going home

33:01.375 --> 33:02.959
with Missy that night.

33:03.041 --> 33:05.709
- Who told you that?
- Your good buddy, Rick, the
DJ.

33:05.792 --> 33:07.875
The cute guy you
hooked up with that night.

33:07.959 --> 33:09.375
(Scotty)
'He didn't think
you were so cute'

33:09.458 --> 33:13.709
after you passed out
on his couch, though.

33:13.792 --> 33:15.083
He gave me some pills.

33:15.166 --> 33:16.709
I barely remember that night.

33:16.792 --> 33:18.291
You remember how Missy

33:18.375 --> 33:19.667
got your sorry
butt out of there.

33:19.750 --> 33:20.875
No, I blacked out.

33:20.959 --> 33:22.750
Yeah, that's bull.

33:22.834 --> 33:23.875
She had your back.

33:23.959 --> 33:25.750
Put her jacket
on you, took you home.

33:25.834 --> 33:29.250
Same jacket you kept
all these years.

33:29.333 --> 33:32.208
Let your daughter wear it.

33:32.291 --> 33:34.291
'Why is that, Julie?'

33:36.166 --> 33:38.625
Tiffany found it in the
attic.
I didn't know it was
there.

33:38.709 --> 33:39.834
You kept it for a reason.

33:39.917 --> 33:41.250
Couldn't bring yourself
to get rid of it.

33:41.333 --> 33:43.250
Something happened
between you two

33:43.333 --> 33:45.667
at the rink or on the way home.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.041
What was it, Julie?

33:54.500 --> 33:56.291
For all my talk
I was still a
virgin

33:56.375 --> 33:58.625
when I went
to the rink that
night.

34:00.500 --> 34:04.041
When I got home,
I realized I wasn't
anymore.

34:09.709 --> 34:11.750
It's Rick?

34:15.125 --> 34:17.375
I remember messing around

34:17.458 --> 34:20.417
and then things got fuzzy.

34:20.500 --> 34:21.792
Next thing I
knew,
Missy was there

34:21.875 --> 34:23.125
and he was kicking us out.

34:25.375 --> 34:27.417
She came back
for you, Julie.

34:29.041 --> 34:32.041
You owe it to her now
to tell the truth.

34:32.125 --> 34:34.041
All she did was help me.

34:36.792 --> 34:38.583
And I was terrible to her.

34:42.333 --> 34:44.208
What happened, Julie?

34:44.291 --> 34:48.250
If I'd been a better friend,
she would still be alive
today.

34:52.500 --> 34:53.458
Do you still feel sick?

34:53.542 --> 34:55.417
Don't even talk to me.

34:55.500 --> 34:56.750
You're mad at me?

34:56.834 --> 34:59.792
I invited you into my
world and you blew it.

34:59.875 --> 35:01.709
You've ruined everything!

35:01.792 --> 35:03.458
I was just
trying to help.

35:03.542 --> 35:04.667
Well, you didn't.

35:04.750 --> 35:06.000
Rick was going
to be my
boyfriend

35:06.083 --> 35:08.959
and now he'll never
speak to me again.

35:09.041 --> 35:10.750
- Were you guys..
- Duh!

35:10.834 --> 35:12.500
How else do you
think
I got into the
over-18?

35:12.583 --> 35:14.959
It's not because I'm
such a great skater.

35:15.041 --> 35:16.333
He's a jerk.

35:16.417 --> 35:17.917
You'll find somebody cooler.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.834
Someone our age.

35:19.917 --> 35:22.375
Boys our age are idiots.

35:22.458 --> 35:24.166
And older guys aren't?

35:25.834 --> 35:29.375
I had kind of a fight
with my mom's boyfriend.

35:30.458 --> 35:33.375
Can I sleep over
your house tonight?

35:33.458 --> 35:34.834
After what you did?

35:34.917 --> 35:36.875
I never want to speak
to you again.

35:36.959 --> 35:40.959
But I don't have
any place to go.

35:41.041 --> 35:44.250
That's your
problem,
not mine.

35:56.333 --> 35:58.625
That's the last time I saw her.

35:58.709 --> 36:01.250
That whistle..

36:01.333 --> 36:03.542
someone she knew?

36:03.625 --> 36:05.709
I didn't look back to see.

36:07.792 --> 36:09.667
I'll never forgive myself.

36:22.166 --> 36:24.875
All this time we've
been looking for a guy in a
van

36:24.959 --> 36:27.125
who took Missy
to the park that night.

36:27.208 --> 36:30.083
Didn't think too much
about a boy on a bike.

36:30.166 --> 36:31.750
It's tough when you're 15.

36:32.792 --> 36:34.959
All the girls move on
to older guys.

36:35.041 --> 36:36.583
(Nick)
'All of a sudden you're
just a squeaky-voice'

36:36.667 --> 36:39.917
little kid with a paper route.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.041
That what Missy thought of you?

36:41.125 --> 36:42.875
Missy wasn't like that.

36:42.959 --> 36:44.750
How come you never
married, Hugh?

36:44.834 --> 36:46.125
Just never found the right girl?

36:47.166 --> 36:49.000
Or maybe you did.

36:49.083 --> 36:50.625
Only she just
wasn't that into you.

36:52.083 --> 36:53.750
We were just friends.

36:53.834 --> 36:55.625
But you wanted
it to be more.

36:55.709 --> 36:57.458
No, it wasn't like that.

36:57.542 --> 36:58.959
It's always that way
with guys, Hugh.

36:59.041 --> 37:00.625
That's why you
came back for her.

37:02.250 --> 37:05.834
You whistled to her, to let
her know you were there.

37:05.917 --> 37:08.375
'Just like you always did
when you were kids.'

37:08.458 --> 37:10.959
Only she wasn't
interested anymore.

37:11.041 --> 37:14.125
And you'd come so far,
put in all that time.

37:14.208 --> 37:15.625
Only Missy was
a fighter.

37:15.709 --> 37:18.667
What? No, you got it all wrong.

37:18.750 --> 37:20.125
No, we don't.

37:20.208 --> 37:23.000
We got your skin under her
fingernail clippings, Hugh.

37:24.041 --> 37:26.291
And your DNA
on that can to prove it.

37:43.583 --> 37:45.000
It was all my fault.

37:45.083 --> 37:47.000
What was your fault, Hugh?

37:47.083 --> 37:49.417
I didn't..

37:49.500 --> 37:51.333
I didn't know what she wanted.

37:51.417 --> 37:53.083
See I didn't,
I didn't
realize..

37:54.250 --> 37:58.250
All she really
needed was a
friend.

37:58.333 --> 38:01.792
I just let it
get all turned
around.

38:20.625 --> 38:22.875
Oh, I can't believe
you brought an extra
pair.

38:22.959 --> 38:26.083
They're my old ones,
but, uh, they're adjustable.

38:26.166 --> 38:27.709
Figured they'd come
in handy someday.

38:27.792 --> 38:32.083
I'm out of practice,
but I bet I can still take
you.

38:32.166 --> 38:33.500
Yeah, we'll see.

39:02.792 --> 39:04.500
Missy!

39:07.125 --> 39:12.208
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

39:12.291 --> 39:14.917
Never felt better.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.583
Well, if it wasn't
for this

39:17.667 --> 39:19.667
bum wheel I totally
would have aced you.

39:19.750 --> 39:21.583
Oh, but my hair got
caught
on my lip gloss

39:21.667 --> 39:23.375
slowed me down.

39:23.458 --> 39:27.375
Tomorrow I'll be dressed
right, whole other race.

39:27.458 --> 39:28.917
Yeah, so you say.

39:31.375 --> 39:35.458
- Uh..
- Tonight really sucked.

39:39.959 --> 39:42.583
But this..

39:42.667 --> 39:43.875
Now..

39:46.417 --> 39:48.667
It kind of makes it all okay.

39:57.041 --> 39:59.875
- What are you doing?
- No, no, I-I just..

39:59.959 --> 40:02.125
And me, I thought
we were friends.

40:02.208 --> 40:04.583
I thought I could trust you.

40:04.667 --> 40:06.625
Well, you-you, you can trust
me.
I thought that--

40:06.709 --> 40:10.333
After everything
that's happened today.

40:10.417 --> 40:11.792
I can't believe you!

40:11.875 --> 40:15.417
No, Missy, Missy, I'm
sorry...
Missy, please!

40:15.500 --> 40:17.583
Look, we can go back to the way
things used to be, okay?

40:17.667 --> 40:19.041
We'd forget it
ever
happened, okay?

40:19.125 --> 40:20.667
We can go back to
the way things
were!

40:20.750 --> 40:22.208
Get off me!

40:24.500 --> 40:26.000
Missy, no!

40:30.709 --> 40:33.375
Missy.

40:33.458 --> 40:34.750
Missy!

43:59.500 --> 44:00.792
