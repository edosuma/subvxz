00:43.043 --> 00:45.337
The alien expert is in.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.715
Time to get to work.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.717
As Carl Sagan once said,

00:50.801 --> 00:54.555
"Extraordinary claims
require extraordinary evidence."

00:55.097 --> 00:58.058
Sorry you didn't get sent into space,
RoboSimian.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.853
But you can still have
plenty of fun here with us.
But you can still have
plenty of fun here with us.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.938
They're not programmed for fun, sir.

01:04.647 --> 01:05.983
We'll see about that.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.989
Please stop dribbling Jupiter.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.826
<i>Hello, honorary NASA scientists.</i>

01:15.909 --> 01:18.954
<i>I'm glad to see you
all making yourselves at home.</i>

01:24.126 --> 01:26.295
<i>Maybe a little too at home.</i>

01:26.378 --> 01:27.671
Excuse me, CARA.

01:27.754 --> 01:32.843
I know we're looking for life, but what
kind of life are we looking for exactly?

01:32.926 --> 01:37.014
<i>Well, the life we're looking for
could be incredibly simple.</i>

01:37.097 --> 01:39.683
<i>Perhaps even made up of only one cell.</i>

01:39.766 --> 01:43.687
<i>Very different from the human body,
which is made up of trillions of cells.</i>

01:44.938 --> 01:46.940
But the kind of life we're looking for

01:47.024 --> 01:50.194
could also be all weird
and green and blobby, right?

01:53.614 --> 01:59.369
<i>Well, technically, I suppose anything
is possible. But most likely not.</i>

01:59.453 --> 02:01.663
How will we know when we find it?
How will we know when we find it?

02:01.747 --> 02:03.373
<i>So glad you asked.</i>

02:03.457 --> 02:06.126
<i>All life forms, even the simplest,</i>

02:06.210 --> 02:10.756
<i>need a few basic things,
beginning with water.</i>

02:12.799 --> 02:14.885
<i>Scientists have looked all over Earth</i>

02:14.968 --> 02:19.598
<i>and discovered wherever
there's liquid water, there's life.</i>

02:20.182 --> 02:24.019
<i>Even in the most unlikely places
or extreme conditions.</i>

02:26.438 --> 02:29.858
<i>We think that's probably true
for life beyond Earth too.</i>

02:30.359 --> 02:36.240
<i>Life also needs organics, which are
molecules that contain the element carbon.</i>

02:36.323 --> 02:39.952
<i>On Earth, every living thing
contains carbon,</i>

02:40.035 --> 02:42.538
<i>from a flea to a tree.</i>

02:43.121 --> 02:45.916
<i>Next, life needs energy to support it.</i>

02:47.543 --> 02:49.461
<i>And time to evolve.</i>

02:57.553 --> 03:02.307
<i>So, if NASA can find all these things
somewhere outside Earth--</i>
<i>So, if NASA can find all these things
somewhere outside Earth--</i>

03:02.391 --> 03:04.226
We might find life!

03:06.144 --> 03:07.938
Well, what are we waiting for?

03:09.314 --> 03:11.692
Everyone knows Saturn is the best planet.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.819
It has its own jewelry.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.154
All the best alien movies
are about Martians.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.739
How about we start with Mars?

03:21.243 --> 03:23.203
<i>That's an excellent idea.</i>

03:23.287 --> 03:27.082
<i>Mars has been at the center
of a lot of NASA's search for life.</i>

03:27.165 --> 03:31.295
<i>In fact, NASA has rovers
collecting data there right now.</i>

03:37.426 --> 03:38.760
Sorry, ma'am.

03:38.844 --> 03:42.472
Wow. Mars, the famous Red Planet.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.853
Fourth farthest from the sun.

03:47.936 --> 03:52.482
Home to two moons and the largest
dust storms in the solar system.

03:53.108 --> 03:56.612
Can you imagine how amazing
it would be to actually go there

03:56.695 --> 03:59.323
and search for clues
to the existence of life?

05:05.681 --> 05:07.599
<i>But the kind of life we're looking for</i>

05:07.683 --> 05:11.019
<i>could also be all weird
and green and blobby, right?</i>

06:01.653 --> 06:04.990
Wait. Go back. I think I found something.

06:06.909 --> 06:09.077
Is that ice?

06:09.828 --> 06:11.496
Ice is frozen water!

06:11.580 --> 06:13.790
That's a huge clue
that there could be life.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.251
Wow.

06:50.369 --> 06:52.996
<i>Great first discovery, scientists.</i>

06:53.080 --> 06:56.583
<i>The water on Mars
appears to be mostly in the form of ice.</i>

06:56.667 --> 07:00.087
<i>But based on the pictures
from our telescopes and rovers,</i>
<i>But based on the pictures
from our telescopes and rovers,</i>

07:00.170 --> 07:04.091
<i>we believe that liquid water might
have existed on the surface of Mars</i>

07:04.174 --> 07:06.260
<i>a long time ago.</i>

07:06.343 --> 07:09.012
<i>Mars is extremely promising</i>

07:09.096 --> 07:13.559
<i>as a place where we might soon
find evidence of past life.</i>

07:13.642 --> 07:17.980
<i>In the meantime,
there is lots of space to keep exploring.</i>

07:31.243 --> 07:33.579
Snoopy illustrates an important point.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.122
Good job, Snoopy.

07:35.789 --> 07:39.835
If we wanna keep finding more places
where there could be potential for life,

07:39.918 --> 07:41.795
we need to follow the water.

07:43.881 --> 07:46.216
Bleah. I'd rather not.

07:49.845 --> 07:51.597
I've been licked by a dog!
