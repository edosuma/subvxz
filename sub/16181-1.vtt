00:59.835 --> 01:01.371
Hey.

01:06.107 --> 01:08.175
What is it, Charley?

01:11.097 --> 01:14.701
Hey! Charley. Who's a good boy?

01:14.801 --> 01:16.486
Huh?

01:17.004 --> 01:20.019
Cora, you've got
enough food here for a month.

01:20.470 --> 01:22.809
The storm's only supposed
to last a couple of days.

01:22.909 --> 01:25.411
My nieces are coming to stay with me.

01:25.911 --> 01:29.348
They get in this afternoon.
Hope it's enough.

01:29.448 --> 01:32.828
All things considered,
do you think that's such a good idea?

01:32.928 --> 01:37.956
The girls, they... they don't have
any options right now, so...

01:38.817 --> 01:40.532
I'm just saying, you know...

01:40.632 --> 01:43.962
we got a storm coming
and it's Halloween tomorrow, so...

01:46.064 --> 01:48.200
Maybe they should just wait.

01:48.300 --> 01:51.434
Not everyone's as superstitious
as you, Donald.

01:52.639 --> 01:54.340
All right, go on.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.125
- See you soon.
- You bet.

02:04.550 --> 02:07.587
Hey, Charley. Hey, come on.

02:07.687 --> 02:09.829
Come on, baby.

02:11.291 --> 02:15.538
Oh, grumpy. Fine, we'll get you home.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.049
Useless.

02:59.739 --> 03:03.273
Hey! It's okay, Charley.

03:06.277 --> 03:09.430
It's okay, Charley,
it's just a bit of lightning.

03:10.849 --> 03:13.808
Hey, come on. Charley?

03:13.908 --> 03:16.655
Charley? Stop it!

03:18.540 --> 03:20.910
Charley, stop it now!

03:21.260 --> 03:24.294
Charley, no! No!

03:24.913 --> 03:26.681
Charley!

03:44.516 --> 03:46.284
Charley!

03:48.688 --> 03:50.321
Charley?

03:52.840 --> 03:54.475
Charley.

04:12.894 --> 04:15.106
You okay in there, boy?

04:19.385 --> 04:22.610
Come on, baby. It's okay.

04:33.947 --> 04:35.750
Oh, no.

05:19.578 --> 05:23.064
- Is everyone okay?
- Fine.

05:24.715 --> 05:27.419
I thought you said you were good to drive.

05:27.519 --> 05:30.737
You're not seriously
going to blame this on me?

05:33.041 --> 05:35.126
Be my guest.

05:39.731 --> 05:42.049
Sounded like a bad one.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.705
You want to talk about it?

05:45.905 --> 05:47.621
No.

05:57.715 --> 06:00.389
We'll get through this, okay?

06:12.463 --> 06:15.896
- I thought we had an agreement.
- And what agreement is that exactly?

06:15.996 --> 06:19.121
That I have a hard time
keeping track of all your rules.

06:19.221 --> 06:22.758
No more arguing in front of Emma,
she's been though enough, okay?

06:22.858 --> 06:26.244
She doesn't need to see us
at each other's throats all the time.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.798
Excuse me if I'm not all
that excited about leaving behind

06:28.898 --> 06:30.890
what little of my life is left.

06:31.613 --> 06:35.786
You're not the only one who's had
to put their life on hold here, Marley.

06:36.987 --> 06:39.981
And I thought we agreed...
no more of this in front of Emma.

06:43.078 --> 06:46.849
We could have found a way. If you really
cared, we could have found a way to stay.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.541
The money's gone, Marley.

06:48.641 --> 06:52.604
Mom and Dad's life insurance didn't come
close to covering Emma's hospital bills.

06:52.704 --> 06:56.274
If we want to be together,
Aunt Cora's the only option.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.709
There's nowhere else to go.

06:59.176 --> 07:02.513
We need to get going,
or we're going to miss the ferry.

07:08.685 --> 07:11.341
The ferry's not much further.

07:57.868 --> 08:00.773
There's supposed to be a ferry.
The schedule said 3:00.

08:00.873 --> 08:03.542
I guess we'll just have to go back.

08:05.443 --> 08:08.987
Sorry, I... I didn't mean
to sneak up on you like that.

08:09.087 --> 08:12.215
The schedule said that there was a 3:00?

08:12.650 --> 08:15.368
Well, uh, lot's of folks
been coming off the island,

08:15.468 --> 08:17.376
so I didn't expect
anybody'd be wanting to go.

08:17.476 --> 08:20.140
- We don't.
- We do.

08:21.492 --> 08:25.313
Well, um, there's a big storm
expected tonight,

08:25.413 --> 08:28.509
and if we was to take you over
to the island now, by ferry,

08:28.609 --> 08:30.666
there might not be another ferry
until the storm breaks.

08:30.766 --> 08:33.639
And that could be a couple of days.

08:34.739 --> 08:37.777
The island's not somewhere
you want to be stuck,

08:37.876 --> 08:41.799
not during a storm, not...
especially not this time of year.

08:42.530 --> 08:46.302
You heard the man,
this is an all around bad idea.

08:46.652 --> 08:51.054
The ferry is scheduled to be running,
and we'd like to be on it.

08:54.425 --> 08:57.394
Have it your way. Oh.

09:02.378 --> 09:05.302
Looks like you'll have
some company after all.

09:07.372 --> 09:09.005
Emma?

09:13.945 --> 09:15.580
Emma?

09:22.119 --> 09:25.494
You folks are gonna be wanting
to get up to the ramp now,

09:25.594 --> 09:29.361
if you want to go.
Just pay when you're on.

09:29.461 --> 09:32.431
There was a young girl in our back seat.
Did you see where she went?

09:32.531 --> 09:35.055
I thought it was just the two of you.

09:36.802 --> 09:38.584
Emma?

09:39.254 --> 09:41.010
Emma!

09:44.775 --> 09:48.280
I can't hold the ferry,
not with the storm coming.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.348
Emma, we need to go!

09:53.985 --> 09:55.119
Emma?

10:01.693 --> 10:03.394
Emma!

10:05.630 --> 10:07.397
Emma!

10:08.233 --> 10:10.602
- Emma!
- Emma!

10:10.702 --> 10:13.506
- Emma!
- Emma, come on, let's go!

10:13.606 --> 10:16.817
- Emma, we have to go now.
- Emma!

10:16.917 --> 10:19.332
Emma, where are you?

10:25.364 --> 10:27.751
Emma, where are you?

10:28.353 --> 10:30.089
Emma!

10:30.789 --> 10:34.759
Emma, we have to get on the ferry,
or we're going to be stuck here tonight!

10:36.261 --> 10:40.031
Emma? We don't want to be stuck here.

10:41.883 --> 10:43.566
Emma!

10:48.573 --> 10:49.993
Emma?

11:03.288 --> 11:04.857
Emma?

11:06.925 --> 11:10.062
It's all right. It's okay.
It's all right. It's okay.

11:10.162 --> 11:13.786
I just, uh... I wanted to let you know
I saw that girl you were looking for.

11:13.886 --> 11:17.672
She was walking towards the ferry.
I just thought you'd want to know.

11:20.338 --> 11:24.376
Hey, I'd, uh, stay off that island
till the storm passes if I were you.

11:25.026 --> 11:29.352
- I think we'll manage.
- Oh, I don't know about that.

11:29.752 --> 11:32.845
Last time a storm hit
that island on Halloween, uh,

11:32.945 --> 11:35.552
half the people there ended up dead.

11:37.754 --> 11:40.723
I'd just steer clear,
that's all I'm saying.

11:41.693 --> 11:44.261
If you're so worried,
then why are you going?

11:46.565 --> 11:48.902
I have my reasons.

11:49.002 --> 11:51.569
I guess that makes two of us.

11:56.690 --> 11:58.793
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

12:25.420 --> 12:28.886
Sarah, I found her! I found Emma!

12:29.307 --> 12:32.709
Em, what are you doing?
You scared the hell out of us.

12:35.262 --> 12:38.231
What is it, Em? Are you all right?

12:40.351 --> 12:43.889
It's Aunt Cora,
something's happened to her.

12:44.889 --> 12:48.425
Aunt Cora's fine,
we just talked to her this morning.

12:49.294 --> 12:53.143
But I saw it... in my dream.

13:02.340 --> 13:05.261
Emma, what's going on?

13:05.361 --> 13:09.541
I'm sorry, I just...
I wanted to see the island.

13:13.351 --> 13:17.050
It's okay. No harm done.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.690
We gotta get going, though.

13:22.727 --> 13:24.882
Her dreams aren't getting any better.

13:27.131 --> 13:29.636
She needs time. Things will get better.

13:30.406 --> 13:33.685
She watched our parents
burn to death in their own car,

13:33.785 --> 13:36.254
she barely survived it herself.

13:36.754 --> 13:39.195
You really think she's ever
going to get over that?

15:39.983 --> 15:42.386
Where the hell is everyone?

15:43.234 --> 15:45.727
Aunt Cora's still not answering.

15:48.572 --> 15:52.894
- Em's been sleeping an awful lot.
- It's her meds. It makes her tired.

15:52.994 --> 15:56.029
Well, that's really going to help
with the nightmares.

16:00.733 --> 16:04.952
- You do know where you're going, right?
- Don't start, okay?

16:07.258 --> 16:09.726
Someone's watching us.

16:13.196 --> 16:15.769
Pick a direction and let's just go.

16:52.937 --> 16:54.838
- What does the GPS say?
- Nothing.

16:54.938 --> 16:57.576
There's no reception out here. I thought
you said you knew where you were going?

16:57.676 --> 17:00.678
I got turned around, okay?

17:00.778 --> 17:03.081
I thought I saw that green car again.

17:03.181 --> 17:05.550
- Guys...
- Nothing is ever your fault, is it?

17:05.651 --> 17:07.518
Guys!

17:07.617 --> 17:10.026
We're almost out of gas.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.348
How long has it been like that?

17:19.946 --> 17:22.406
- What is that?
- I don't know, Em.

17:22.506 --> 17:25.127
Drive, just drive.

17:50.429 --> 17:52.998
No... No.

17:53.098 --> 17:56.134
This isn't happening.
Tell me this isn't happening.

17:56.234 --> 18:00.144
We just have to walk, okay?
Aunt Cora's is just down the road.

18:11.116 --> 18:14.219
- Leave it. Let's just go.
- We need Emma's medication.

18:14.319 --> 18:17.587
- Let's just go, come on.
- Sarah.

18:20.257 --> 18:22.794
Okay. Let's go.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.065
Who's wishing we stayed in the city now?

18:26.797 --> 18:28.869
We need to go faster.

18:32.247 --> 18:34.007
Emma!

18:36.128 --> 18:39.153
Are you okay? We're almost there.

18:42.712 --> 18:45.569
There. Is that Aunt Cora's house?

18:50.821 --> 18:52.855
Oh, my God.

18:54.124 --> 18:56.294
Get Emma in the house.

18:56.394 --> 18:58.263
- What?
- Marley, get Emma in the house.

18:58.363 --> 19:00.498
What are you going to do?

19:00.598 --> 19:02.718
No. No, Sarah...

19:02.818 --> 19:06.438
Sarah! Sarah! Sarah, don't go!

19:06.538 --> 19:09.242
Sarah, I saw this in my dream!

19:46.111 --> 19:48.229
Aunt Cora.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.290
Oh, my God.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.927
It's here. It's here!

20:44.868 --> 20:46.570
Marley!

20:47.722 --> 20:50.792
Emma, stay in the basement.
It isn't safe up here.

20:50.892 --> 20:55.030
- Where's Sarah?
- I don't know, Em!

20:55.880 --> 20:57.914
I don't know.

21:01.018 --> 21:02.686
Sarah?

21:05.590 --> 21:07.226
Sarah?

21:10.327 --> 21:12.074
Give me a hand.

21:12.174 --> 21:14.900
Don't just stand there, Marley,
help me get her in the house.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.068
- Where's Emma?
- She's already in the basement.

21:21.505 --> 21:23.842
What the hell is going on, Sarah?

21:24.042 --> 21:26.077
- What happened to her?
- Listen to me...

21:26.177 --> 21:29.478
- What happened to Aunt Cora?
- Listen to me...

21:29.578 --> 21:34.019
There's someone out there that killed
Aunt Cora, and they're after this woman.

21:34.119 --> 21:36.755
Do you understand what that means?

21:38.655 --> 21:40.990
We need to get in the basement!

21:41.792 --> 21:43.840
Marley, come on!

22:20.197 --> 22:23.242
- How's she doing?
- Not good.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.134
My three months in medical school
isn't going to cut it.

22:26.234 --> 22:28.473
She needs a doctor.

22:45.823 --> 22:49.291
You... you must hide.

22:49.761 --> 22:52.330
Death has come.

22:52.830 --> 22:56.953
The killing won't stop
until the end of Halloween.

22:58.355 --> 23:01.973
- Everything's going to be okay.
- No, it's not.

23:02.323 --> 23:04.292
I didn't believe...

23:05.589 --> 23:07.819
You have to.

23:12.916 --> 23:15.198
What did she just say?

23:15.298 --> 23:17.822
What the hell is she talking about?

23:17.922 --> 23:20.134
I don't know.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.546
She's in a lot of pain.

23:22.646 --> 23:25.195
It's time you tell me
what happened to Aunt Cora.

23:26.597 --> 23:28.433
I'm not sure, okay?

23:28.533 --> 23:31.576
Stop treating me like a child!
Tell me what happened!

23:31.676 --> 23:33.638
I don't know what happened
to her, all right!

23:33.738 --> 23:36.068
I deserve to know, Sarah.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.034
Fine, you wanna know?

23:41.578 --> 23:45.580
Her eyes were gone, just gone, like someone
cut them out of her head or something.

23:48.485 --> 23:52.188
And then some sick twist
set her insides on fire.

23:53.774 --> 23:55.452
What?

23:59.330 --> 24:01.022
What?

24:03.334 --> 24:05.370
I'm sorry.

24:05.720 --> 24:09.046
I shouldn't have told you, not like that.

24:21.925 --> 24:25.557
This afternoon, in the truck, Emma said
she had a dream about Aunt Cora,

24:25.657 --> 24:29.479
that something happened to her.
How did she know that, Sarah? How?

24:29.579 --> 24:31.196
It's...

24:31.296 --> 24:34.356
It's coincidence. I mean, it has to be.

24:34.456 --> 24:36.677
She's been having those types
of dreams about all of us.

24:36.777 --> 24:41.272
She thinks death follows her
around wherever she goes.

24:41.372 --> 24:45.408
She's terrified that everyone
around her is gonna die.

24:52.081 --> 24:54.711
Well, I'm not gonna let that happen.

24:59.824 --> 25:00.857
<i>Emma!</i>

25:31.087 --> 25:33.291
Emma's still out.

25:33.391 --> 25:35.313
Let her sleep.

25:35.413 --> 25:39.195
She had a rough night,
and I don't want her to see Aunt Cora.

25:42.181 --> 25:44.465
That woman doesn't look too good.

25:45.158 --> 25:49.218
If we don't get her to a hospital,
she's not going to last much longer.

25:52.042 --> 25:54.276
I found a hose.

25:58.047 --> 26:01.390
Okay, so we'll siphon the gas
from Aunt Cora's car...

26:01.490 --> 26:05.123
that can't be too hard...
we'll get ours going, and...

26:06.223 --> 26:08.424
we'll get her to the hospital.

26:11.560 --> 26:15.332
She said the killing won't stop
until the end of Halloween.

26:15.745 --> 26:20.196
What if whoever chased her here
and killed Aunt Cora is just...

26:20.596 --> 26:23.381
out there waiting for us?

26:26.042 --> 26:28.880
If we stay here, she'll die for sure.

26:32.917 --> 26:35.151
Give me the hose.

27:10.487 --> 27:12.757
Just don't look, okay?

27:13.057 --> 27:15.135
Let's just get this over with.

27:27.054 --> 27:29.224
I should have listened to him.

27:29.974 --> 27:31.682
Listened to who?

27:32.736 --> 27:35.412
That creepy guy back at the ferry?

27:36.257 --> 27:39.840
He said the last time a storm
hit here on Halloween...

27:40.619 --> 27:42.985
nearly everyone died.

27:43.487 --> 27:47.705
He said what?
And you're just telling me this now?

27:47.805 --> 27:49.923
I thought he was just some weirdo, okay?

27:50.023 --> 27:51.868
For all you know,
he's the one doing all of this!

27:51.968 --> 27:55.532
I didn't want to worry you
any more than you already were.

27:55.632 --> 27:58.753
I am so sick and tired of you
thinking you know what's best for me.

27:58.853 --> 28:01.421
- That's enough, Marley.
- It's not enough that our parents are dead?

28:01.521 --> 28:04.273
- Now you're going to get the rest of us...
- I said that's enough!

28:10.463 --> 28:12.164
Marley...

28:14.134 --> 28:17.971
Don't touch me. Don't, okay, just don't.

28:20.206 --> 28:23.199
Why would someone do that
to another person?

28:31.702 --> 28:33.671
It's gone.

28:33.771 --> 28:36.870
- What's gone?
- The car is gone.

28:41.245 --> 28:42.880
Okay.

28:43.280 --> 28:47.135
- Okay, so... so we'll walk.
- We need to get that woman to the hospital.

28:47.235 --> 28:50.281
We'll send someone. We just need to get
the hell out of here while we still can!

28:50.381 --> 28:52.923
What about Emma? She won't
make it far with her leg like that.

28:53.023 --> 28:56.895
Well, what do you suggest we do,
just wait here until that psycho shows up?

29:02.766 --> 29:04.435
No.

29:05.135 --> 29:06.737
No way in hell.

29:06.837 --> 29:10.072
We don't have a choice, Marley.
You know we don't.

29:11.074 --> 29:13.311
You keep watch.

29:14.077 --> 29:16.345
I'll deal with it.

29:43.606 --> 29:48.094
Marley, I'm... I'm going
to need your help after all.

30:41.328 --> 30:43.201
Marley!

30:43.901 --> 30:46.256
Em, stay where you are!

31:02.952 --> 31:07.010
- Is everything all right?
- I woke up, and you guys weren't there.

31:07.890 --> 31:10.262
Em, you shouldn't be out here.
You need to go back inside.

31:10.362 --> 31:13.678
But everyone was gone.
I didn't know where you were...

31:13.778 --> 31:14.997
Emma!

31:18.834 --> 31:21.370
Emma, get away from there!

31:25.776 --> 31:27.478
Emma!

31:27.578 --> 31:29.757
Emma. Emma, kick!

31:30.747 --> 31:32.982
- Kick!
- Get it!

31:38.054 --> 31:40.441
Emma, kick!

32:05.649 --> 32:08.469
Emma! Marley!

32:44.071 --> 32:47.305
This isn't happening.
Tell me this isn't happening!

32:50.544 --> 32:54.230
Em, not much longer. Everything's going
to be all right. We're getting out of here.

32:54.330 --> 32:55.761
And where the hell are we going to go?

32:55.861 --> 32:59.522
Or have you forgotten that there's no
way off this island until tomorrow?

33:01.280 --> 33:04.058
We'll... we'll find help in town.

33:04.608 --> 33:09.564
Are you serious? Did you see that thing?
Who the hell's going to be able to help us?

33:10.114 --> 33:14.151
I don't know, all right?
But you're not helping the situation.

33:14.251 --> 33:16.652
Do you understand?

33:18.822 --> 33:20.362
Sarah's right, Em.

33:20.462 --> 33:24.624
We're going to get through this,
and then we'll find a way out of here.

33:30.233 --> 33:33.137
I should... I should have told you.

33:33.237 --> 33:35.372
Told me what?

33:35.672 --> 33:38.475
- I saw it.
- We all did.

33:38.575 --> 33:42.980
- Just try not to think about it.
- No, no. I saw it in my dream.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.429
I... I should have warned you.

33:46.249 --> 33:50.165
- That woman's dead because of me.
- None of this is your fault, Em.

33:53.922 --> 33:57.161
Whatever's happening here
has nothing to do with you.

33:57.261 --> 33:59.237
Sarah!

34:05.335 --> 34:07.069
What was that?

34:07.871 --> 34:10.371
Everyone stay in the car.

34:25.221 --> 34:27.257
Hitting him didn't do that.

34:27.357 --> 34:30.594
We need to get the hell out of here now
before we end up like him.

34:30.695 --> 34:33.542
- We need to find help.
- These people aren't going to help us.

34:33.641 --> 34:37.114
You saw how they stared at us. They were
scared, they knew this was going to happen.

34:37.215 --> 34:40.708
There's nowhere else to go,
you said so yourself.

34:41.338 --> 34:44.675
We... we can go to the ferry dock.
Maybe there's another boat there.

34:44.775 --> 34:47.045
They should at least have a radio, right?

34:47.145 --> 34:50.781
Please, Sarah, just this once,
I need you to listen to me.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.224
We need to go now.

34:55.150 --> 34:57.987
Okay, let's get in the car.

35:01.091 --> 35:02.460
Emma?

35:02.760 --> 35:05.627
- Emma?
- Emma!

35:06.162 --> 35:09.264
She just wandered off, right?
Like she did before?

35:09.933 --> 35:11.540
Emma!

35:11.640 --> 35:14.572
If something happened,
we would have heard.

35:14.672 --> 35:16.905
Oh, my God.

35:21.611 --> 35:25.551
She thinks everyone around her dies.
She's trying to protect us.

35:25.651 --> 35:28.953
No. No, no, no. no!

35:29.053 --> 35:30.856
Emma!

35:31.738 --> 35:33.474
Emma!

35:35.059 --> 35:36.828
Emma!

35:37.428 --> 35:39.061
Emma?

35:45.101 --> 35:46.836
Emma!

35:49.673 --> 35:51.377
Emma!

35:54.644 --> 35:56.345
Emma?

35:57.147 --> 35:58.781
Emma!

36:00.484 --> 36:02.251
Emma!

36:04.170 --> 36:05.899
Emma?

36:16.032 --> 36:17.766
Emma?

36:38.321 --> 36:40.055
Emma?

36:55.655 --> 36:56.982
Emma?

36:58.163 --> 37:00.575
Emma, none of this is your fault.

37:01.711 --> 37:03.896
Not another sound.

37:10.120 --> 37:11.887
Emma?

37:23.199 --> 37:25.202
They're dead.

37:25.502 --> 37:27.703
They're all dead.

37:53.129 --> 37:54.896
Emma?

37:59.869 --> 38:03.305
Emma, is that you?
You need to come out, okay?

38:04.207 --> 38:06.642
None of this is your fault.

38:14.234 --> 38:16.083
Em, you in here?

38:20.439 --> 38:23.694
You need to get out of here. Get out!

38:38.342 --> 38:39.779
Sarah!

38:41.644 --> 38:43.096
Sarah!

39:03.566 --> 39:05.233
No!

39:17.313 --> 39:19.748
Come on, let's go, let's go!

39:52.363 --> 39:54.030
I can't be here,
I need to find my sisters.

39:54.130 --> 39:55.753
Sorry, I cannot let you do that.

39:55.853 --> 39:58.221
What you need to do
is shut the hell up, okay?

39:58.321 --> 40:01.457
That thing out there was almost gone
until you and your friends showed up.

40:01.557 --> 40:04.061
You almost got us all killed.

40:04.401 --> 40:07.131
Let her go, Toby.
I think she gets the message.

40:07.231 --> 40:09.611
Yeah? She better have.

40:12.233 --> 40:15.503
Now, maybe you'll be able
to keep her quiet, too.

40:19.576 --> 40:21.209
Sarah?

40:21.978 --> 40:24.180
What did they do to you?

40:24.280 --> 40:26.715
She didn't leave us any choice.

40:28.416 --> 40:31.786
She wouldn't stop yelling.
It was going to hear us in here.

40:32.155 --> 40:34.504
Where's Emma? Did you find her?

40:37.226 --> 40:39.897
Please, our sister is still out there.

40:39.997 --> 40:43.234
I'm sorry, but if your sister's out there
right now, she's already dead.

40:43.334 --> 40:47.402
But you're all alive,
you've managed to survive.

40:48.387 --> 40:50.955
We survived by accident.

40:53.342 --> 40:56.213
When everyone else ran away,
we all hid in the freezer.

40:56.313 --> 40:58.407
We could hear them.

40:58.807 --> 41:02.519
But we knew if we opened the door,
we'd be dead right along with them.

41:06.254 --> 41:08.546
What the hell is that thing out there?

41:08.646 --> 41:12.712
Why don't you ask Mr. Internet Sensation
over here. He seems to have all the answers.

41:12.813 --> 41:15.666
You knew about this at the ferry,
and you didn't say anything?

41:15.766 --> 41:18.291
Look, I tried to warn you,
all right, I did.

41:18.391 --> 41:21.388
When I saw you, I was gonna tell you guys
everything, but you drove off too fast.

41:21.488 --> 41:24.124
You said that some people died
in the last storm that was here.

41:24.224 --> 41:26.609
You never said anything
about that thing out there!

41:26.709 --> 41:29.780
I was just trying to mess with you,
all right? I didn't think it was real.

41:29.880 --> 41:33.817
Yeah? Thought it was
real enough to bring your gun.

41:37.820 --> 41:42.453
Okay, look, I have a web series, all right?
I stay overnight at haunted places.

41:42.553 --> 41:45.265
None of them ever really
turn out to be haunted, right?

41:45.365 --> 41:48.948
I bring the gun because you never know who
you're going to run into on these things.

41:49.048 --> 41:52.116
It's just me.
There's a lot of crazies out there.

41:52.802 --> 41:55.659
I just bring it for protection. It's...

41:59.909 --> 42:02.468
A couple of weeks ago, I...

42:02.568 --> 42:06.436
I was in a bar.
I met this old guy, he was drunk.

42:06.792 --> 42:10.086
Started in with this story
about an island that he used to live on.

42:10.186 --> 42:13.657
Said that on Halloween, 1915, a storm hit,

42:13.757 --> 42:16.159
killed half the people here.

42:16.659 --> 42:20.828
Get to the part where you tell us
what's killing everyone out there.

42:22.431 --> 42:24.359
Officially?

42:24.459 --> 42:27.103
The locals say it was the storm.

42:27.203 --> 42:31.208
The old man says that the storm
brought something with it.

42:31.308 --> 42:33.177
Something evil.

42:33.277 --> 42:36.179
Yeah. Tell her why.

42:36.479 --> 42:39.377
On the Eve of Halloween,
before the storm hit,

42:39.477 --> 42:41.649
the townspeople, they...

42:41.749 --> 42:44.854
they burned six girls at the stake for...

42:44.954 --> 42:47.391
for practicing witchcraft.

42:47.491 --> 42:52.053
Now, as the story goes, before the girls
burned to death, they summoned a storm...

42:53.529 --> 42:56.411
Lightning struck each one of them,
pulling their spirits up into the storm,

42:56.511 --> 43:00.437
so they could return
as something far, far more evil.

43:01.621 --> 43:04.741
They unleashed their revenge
on the island until the sun came up...

43:04.841 --> 43:06.879
ending All Hallows' Eve.

43:07.159 --> 43:09.904
And that's not even the best part.

43:12.682 --> 43:15.115
The witches, they, um...

43:15.215 --> 43:18.155
they vowed to return
on the anniversary of their murder,

43:18.255 --> 43:20.578
once every hundred years,

43:20.678 --> 43:23.682
wipe out everyone
who dares stay on the island.

43:25.895 --> 43:28.465
People around here have been
telling that story for years,

43:28.565 --> 43:30.701
but nobody ever believed them.

43:30.801 --> 43:34.672
Yeah, well, I'm sure as hell a believer.

43:35.572 --> 43:38.909
- So how do we kill it?
- We don't.

43:39.009 --> 43:41.096
We survive it.

43:41.196 --> 43:43.514
The killing won't stop
until the end of Halloween.

43:43.614 --> 43:48.012
Tonight's Halloween, and that's why
we're not leaving until morning...

43:49.211 --> 43:51.625
not until sunrise.

43:51.820 --> 43:54.392
We'll stay here for the night...

43:54.492 --> 43:58.263
and that thing will go back where
it came from, just like it did last time.

43:58.363 --> 44:01.421
Well, that's not happening.
I told you, our sister's out there,

44:01.521 --> 44:03.082
- and we're going to find her.
- You can't.

44:03.182 --> 44:05.670
What makes you think
you're the only one who's lost someone?

44:05.770 --> 44:07.471
If you wanna stop us,
you're gonna have to shoot us.

44:07.571 --> 44:11.624
- I'm not playing around here!
- Hey, just let her go, Toby!

44:11.724 --> 44:15.261
No one is leaving here
until morning, okay?

44:15.361 --> 44:19.113
Until that sun rises,
no one is leaving this building.

44:20.715 --> 44:22.852
I don't think it kills everyone.

44:23.953 --> 44:26.623
I don't...
I don't think it kills everyone.

44:26.723 --> 44:29.860
No... not right away at least.

44:30.760 --> 44:33.246
You know, I think
it's taking them somewhere.

44:33.346 --> 44:35.948
And why do you think that?

44:37.700 --> 44:41.037
When we were out chasing
after these two, you know...

44:41.137 --> 44:45.041
I saw quite a few bloody drag marks
where there was no bodies.

44:45.141 --> 44:46.343
And?

44:46.443 --> 44:50.026
And they were all heading
in the same direction.

44:52.381 --> 44:54.888
I've been thinking about it, and...

44:54.988 --> 44:58.596
the only thing that would make sense is if
it's dragging them all to the same place.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.755
But why?

45:01.357 --> 45:03.861
And who says they're not already dead?

45:03.961 --> 45:06.963
I'm just saying
that there's still a chance.

45:07.063 --> 45:10.433
Why take some of the bodies,
but not the others?

45:10.533 --> 45:13.123
- Maybe there are survivors out there.
- Jill's dead, all right?

45:13.223 --> 45:16.800
Then where's her body, huh?
Why wasn't it here with the others?

45:16.900 --> 45:18.855
Who's Jill?

45:21.143 --> 45:22.979
Ask him.

45:23.079 --> 45:25.949
You know as well as I do that if I
would've opened up that freezer door,

45:26.049 --> 45:27.791
we would all be dead.

45:27.891 --> 45:30.214
Okay? I saved your life.

45:31.086 --> 45:33.956
We never should have been here
in the first place.

45:35.992 --> 45:38.014
Come with us.

45:38.526 --> 45:41.765
You're looking for someone, too.
We can search together.

45:41.865 --> 45:45.400
You must be good
with tracking and stuff, right?

45:47.535 --> 45:49.992
This was our first trip out.

45:51.874 --> 45:54.805
We came to the island because
you're not allowed to hunt here.

45:54.905 --> 45:57.762
The deer don't know
to be afraid, you know?

45:59.882 --> 46:01.843
They're easy picking.

46:02.952 --> 46:05.820
I was just trying
to impress my girlfriend.

46:07.155 --> 46:10.491
Well, none of that changes
the fact that no one's leaving.

46:12.827 --> 46:14.318
Says who?

46:14.418 --> 46:16.840
- Oh, you don't got the guts!
- Yeah? Try me!

46:16.940 --> 46:19.265
Okay, okay, okay,
this is getting out of hand.

46:19.365 --> 46:22.470
Toby, if they want to leave,
just let them leave.

46:23.171 --> 46:25.509
Maybe they'll lead it away, right?

46:25.609 --> 46:27.575
Come on.

46:32.495 --> 46:34.780
Somebody help me, please!

46:37.620 --> 46:38.622
Anybody!

46:38.722 --> 46:41.125
- Do you see anything?
- Not yet.

46:41.225 --> 46:44.728
- Nothing over here.
- God, you need to help me!

46:45.228 --> 46:49.499
- You're kidding me, right?
- If I'm dying, I'm leaving a record.

46:49.599 --> 46:52.336
I'm going to find her and shut her up
before she gets us all killed.

46:52.436 --> 46:55.055
No, wait. Wait.

46:55.405 --> 46:57.389
I see her in the parking lot.

47:00.174 --> 47:04.245
Somebody! Please!

47:06.449 --> 47:08.966
Why is she just standing there,
out in the open like that?

47:09.066 --> 47:12.388
- We got to go get her.
- No, not so fast. Something's not right.

47:12.488 --> 47:15.895
- We can't just let her die out there!
- There.

47:15.995 --> 47:18.821
There it is. Do you see it?

47:23.500 --> 47:27.764
- Help me!
- Oh, my God. It's using her as bait.

47:27.864 --> 47:30.070
So, what do we do?

47:30.240 --> 47:32.926
- Nothing.
- We can't just do nothing...

47:44.236 --> 47:47.273
- What the hell were you thinking?
- It slipped, okay? I'm sorry.

47:47.373 --> 47:49.529
We have to get out of here.

47:49.959 --> 47:53.839
Maybe we're good, maybe it didn't hear us.

47:55.297 --> 47:57.401
We'll hide it out in the freezer
just like last time.

47:57.501 --> 48:00.023
We can't get trapped in here,
we have to find Emma.

48:00.123 --> 48:02.338
You can stand out here
and discuss this all you want,

48:02.438 --> 48:05.174
but as soon as that freezer door closes...

48:06.560 --> 48:09.696
- ...there's no getting in.
- It's keeping people alive, Toby.

48:09.796 --> 48:12.263
You just saw it yourself.

48:12.615 --> 48:16.720
And Jill might still be alive.
Help me find her. You owe her that.

48:16.820 --> 48:20.421
Look, we're no use to anybody
if we're dead.

48:21.656 --> 48:23.993
Now, who's coming with me?

48:39.241 --> 48:41.347
Nichole, what the hell are you doing?
Come on.

48:41.447 --> 48:44.712
I don't want anybody else to die
because I did nothing.

48:45.347 --> 48:50.078
- Come on, Alex, don't be stupid.
- You're a coward, Toby.

48:51.986 --> 48:55.315
I just don't see the upside
in being a dead hero.

48:57.760 --> 49:00.062
It was nice knowing you.

49:24.369 --> 49:26.337
Good luck.

49:56.869 --> 49:58.917
Do you hear that?

50:01.621 --> 50:03.426
It's gone.

50:03.526 --> 50:06.663
It stopped,
that doesn't mean that it's gone.

50:07.363 --> 50:09.866
I only have three rounds left.

50:09.966 --> 50:12.468
That's not going to get us far.

50:14.602 --> 50:17.297
The sheriff's station is a block down.

50:17.697 --> 50:20.177
We might stay out of sight
if we go through the alley in the back.

50:20.277 --> 50:23.896
- What if it's waiting for us there?
- We need those weapons.

50:25.680 --> 50:28.593
You head there. I'll draw it away.

50:29.585 --> 50:32.672
- I'm going to need this.
- Marley, what the hell are you doing?

50:32.772 --> 50:34.573
Marley!

50:55.661 --> 50:57.929
Go to the left.

51:21.202 --> 51:24.423
- Maybe we should have gone with them.
- I didn't stop you.

51:24.523 --> 51:26.959
What if there are other people still alive
out there? We could help them.

51:27.109 --> 51:31.179
We already risked our necks once for them,
look at the thanks that got us.

51:32.181 --> 51:37.367
Okay? The only person I'm interested
in keeping alive now is myself.

51:39.420 --> 51:41.890
Well, I'm going after them, and they're...

51:50.579 --> 51:52.555
Come on!

52:47.221 --> 52:50.073
I guess we wait and see
what your sister has in store.

53:35.737 --> 53:38.274
What the hell did she do?

53:38.836 --> 53:41.211
Okay, if we're going to go,
we're going to go now.

53:41.311 --> 53:43.279
Go. I got your back. Go.

53:43.379 --> 53:46.181
It's just around
the other side of the building.

54:37.066 --> 54:39.511
Check that room over there.

54:55.350 --> 54:57.787
Hello. Can anyone hear me?

54:59.672 --> 55:03.276
Hello? Does anybody copy? Can you hear me?

55:08.713 --> 55:11.538
Hello. Is anyone out there?

55:14.202 --> 55:17.807
Please. Can anyone hear me?
This is an emergency.

55:18.207 --> 55:22.412
Hello. Does anybody copy?
Can you hear me? This is an emergency.

55:22.512 --> 55:24.668
Is anyone out there?

55:25.715 --> 55:29.184
Hello? Does anybody hear me?
This is an emergency.

55:36.158 --> 55:39.994
I'm okay. I'm okay.

55:45.734 --> 55:47.430
Do you think it heard us?

55:47.920 --> 55:49.923
I don't know.

55:50.773 --> 55:52.940
Come on, let's go.

56:30.145 --> 56:31.625
This is everything.

56:31.725 --> 56:34.550
Do you really think all this
is going to stop that thing?

56:34.650 --> 56:38.583
Well, it slowed it down
the first time. That's...

56:38.683 --> 56:41.096
something, right?

56:42.558 --> 56:44.660
She'll be back.

56:46.862 --> 56:49.169
We'd best be going, Sarah.

56:50.593 --> 56:53.060
We don't want to be looking in the dark.

57:05.547 --> 57:08.317
So, are you going to show us
how to load these things?

57:08.417 --> 57:10.419
Everything is loaded and good to go.

57:11.119 --> 57:14.118
You just got to release the safety.
It's, uh, it's right there,

57:14.218 --> 57:17.761
by, uh, by your thumb. You wanna just...

57:17.861 --> 57:19.694
press it.

57:23.431 --> 57:26.569
You said that all the drag marks
were headed in the same direction.

57:26.669 --> 57:28.964
Which way was that?

57:29.571 --> 57:33.877
Well, these are the ones...

57:34.277 --> 57:36.151
that I saw this morning.

57:37.696 --> 57:39.765
And this...

57:39.865 --> 57:42.803
this is the one we saw on the way here.

57:44.353 --> 57:47.917
They all seem to be leading
to this side of the island.

57:48.224 --> 57:52.756
- What's over here?
- Nothing really, it's just forest.

57:54.796 --> 57:58.301
There is an old power station
not far from there.

57:58.401 --> 58:00.904
It's been closed for years.

58:01.304 --> 58:03.005
Right...

58:03.401 --> 58:05.133
here.

58:10.812 --> 58:12.327
What the hell?

58:28.647 --> 58:30.965
No! Please, no!

58:46.949 --> 58:48.471
Shoot it!

58:59.777 --> 59:01.843
I'll get the door.

59:06.568 --> 59:09.559
Alex? Alex.

59:30.660 --> 59:32.470
Get in!

59:34.696 --> 59:38.632
- Where's Alex and Nichole?
- Go! Go, go!

59:39.751 --> 59:43.405
Head out of town.
I think I know where Emma is.

59:44.873 --> 59:46.981
Are you going to tell me what happened?

59:47.081 --> 59:49.831
It killed them, all right?
Like it does everyone else.

59:51.213 --> 59:53.516
Where were you all that time?

59:54.766 --> 59:57.928
I thought I heard Emma, so I went looking.

01:00:00.622 --> 01:00:02.356
And?

01:00:03.258 --> 01:00:05.557
I found this.

01:00:10.214 --> 01:00:13.472
But there were drag marks,
like Alex was saying.

01:00:13.572 --> 01:00:15.927
She's still alive, okay?

01:00:27.949 --> 01:00:31.123
- I think it's a left up here.
- To go where?

01:00:31.223 --> 01:00:34.841
Alex and Nichole thought they found
the spot it might be taking them.

01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:36.656
Okay.

01:00:40.695 --> 01:00:43.983
- You sure about this?
- There's an old power plant.

01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:46.136
It looks like the drag marks
are leading there.

01:01:19.334 --> 01:01:23.738
- Better than nothing, right?
- Yeah. It should be through here.

01:01:40.188 --> 01:01:42.471
We should keep going.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.008
There.

01:02:05.447 --> 01:02:07.134
Sarah.

01:02:20.094 --> 01:02:22.478
There's a trail over this way.

01:02:23.435 --> 01:02:26.217
This must be where it's dragging them.

01:02:29.604 --> 01:02:31.358
Come on.

01:02:47.739 --> 01:02:49.407
Sarah?

01:03:00.434 --> 01:03:02.103
Sarah?

01:03:34.803 --> 01:03:36.304
Sarah?

01:03:51.753 --> 01:03:54.121
Sarah, is that you?

01:04:06.801 --> 01:04:08.386
Sarah?

01:04:11.573 --> 01:04:12.933
Sarah!

01:04:13.033 --> 01:04:14.809
Marley!

01:04:57.218 --> 01:04:59.355
This must be where they burned them.

01:05:00.055 --> 01:05:01.991
The girls.

01:05:02.291 --> 01:05:04.112
Like Seth was saying.

01:05:10.164 --> 01:05:13.087
The trail, it just ends here.

01:05:17.472 --> 01:05:19.773
There's fresh blood here.

01:05:20.675 --> 01:05:22.361
Marley!

01:05:26.414 --> 01:05:30.898
Oh, my God. They're in here, Marley.
There in here!

01:05:52.773 --> 01:05:56.595
Please, please, please, please.
It's gonna be back.

01:05:56.695 --> 01:05:59.763
It feeds on us.

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:04.051
Emma!

01:06:05.553 --> 01:06:07.788
Emma, say something!

01:06:14.811 --> 01:06:17.515
No. No.

01:06:20.702 --> 01:06:23.301
Emma, say something!

01:06:29.143 --> 01:06:31.878
No. No, no!

01:06:32.547 --> 01:06:37.252
- Emma!
- She... she needs to be quiet.

01:06:37.352 --> 01:06:40.589
- It will hear her.
- Emma!

01:06:42.324 --> 01:06:46.893
Marley, help me!
She has to be here somewhere!

01:07:03.194 --> 01:07:06.529
Over here! Over here, I have her!

01:07:06.914 --> 01:07:08.764
Emma!

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:11.964
- Emma!
- Be quiet.

01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:19.235
- Be quiet. Please, please, please be quiet.
- It's gonna be okay, Emma?

01:07:24.231 --> 01:07:25.880
Emma.

01:07:35.209 --> 01:07:38.242
Emma, we're gonna get you out of here.

01:07:39.831 --> 01:07:43.486
No! No! No! Help me! Help me! Help!

01:07:43.586 --> 01:07:46.760
Help me! Help me! Help!

01:07:51.993 --> 01:07:54.794
Get up. Get up.

01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:06.833
- Get her out of here. Keep her safe.
- Sarah? Sarah, no! No!

01:08:06.933 --> 01:08:09.435
You're not going to get her,
you son of a bitch!

01:08:09.535 --> 01:08:11.098
Sarah!

01:08:12.814 --> 01:08:14.481
Sarah!

01:08:25.926 --> 01:08:29.729
Emma, go on.
Emma, can you help me? Come on.

01:08:31.863 --> 01:08:33.567
Emma, we've got to get out of here.

01:08:43.644 --> 01:08:46.048
Come on, Emma, just a little further.

01:08:47.348 --> 01:08:51.453
Emma? Emma, you're going
to have to help, okay?

01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:56.412
Look. Look, that must be
part of the power plant.

01:08:56.511 --> 01:08:58.791
Come on. Almost there.

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:02.465
Hang in there, Emma.

01:09:02.665 --> 01:09:04.999
Emma, stay with me.

01:09:26.821 --> 01:09:28.435
No.

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:38.634
- <i>I saw this in my dream.</i>
- Emma, I know. Come on.

01:09:38.734 --> 01:09:40.569
Emma, don't!

01:09:41.069 --> 01:09:42.737
Emma!

01:10:20.909 --> 01:10:24.113
It's okay. It's okay.

01:10:24.913 --> 01:10:26.715
We need to get out of here.

01:10:26.815 --> 01:10:28.717
I thought...

01:10:28.817 --> 01:10:30.984
I thought you were...

01:10:31.084 --> 01:10:33.453
Yeah, me too.

01:10:34.122 --> 01:10:37.290
Emma. Emma?

01:10:39.446 --> 01:10:42.531
It's okay, it's okay, it's me.

01:10:55.309 --> 01:10:59.196
- We don't have time for that.
- I've almost got it. I've almost...

01:11:00.314 --> 01:11:02.613
I've got it!

01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:14.444
Come on.

01:11:45.226 --> 01:11:49.131
- I'm scared.
- I know. We all are.

01:11:49.231 --> 01:11:53.846
We just need to wait it out in here
until morning, and this will all be over.

01:11:54.835 --> 01:11:57.838
We should find somewhere
to stay out of sight.

01:12:09.650 --> 01:12:12.952
We stick together, right?
No more running off.

01:12:15.657 --> 01:12:18.527
Oh, my God! Get it off me! Get it off!

01:12:18.627 --> 01:12:20.779
Get it off me! Oh, my God! Get it off me!

01:12:21.129 --> 01:12:25.120
- Emma, Emma, go.
- No! I'm not leaving you!

01:12:25.226 --> 01:12:26.902
Sarah.

01:12:27.002 --> 01:12:29.511
Emma, I said, go!

01:12:35.843 --> 01:12:39.783
Go, go! There must be somewhere
to hide, somewhere it can't find us.

01:12:43.183 --> 01:12:47.767
- There's no way out. It won't get to us.
- There's no time! Run!

01:12:50.792 --> 01:12:52.860
Keep going!

01:13:01.136 --> 01:13:03.183
Keep going.

01:13:35.936 --> 01:13:38.571
There. We can hide in there.

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:55.023
We're going to get out of here, okay?

01:13:55.123 --> 01:13:57.882
No. No, we aren't.

01:13:58.326 --> 01:14:01.694
I saw it, in my dream.

01:14:03.264 --> 01:14:05.951
Everyone around me dies.

01:14:06.051 --> 01:14:09.588
We're not dying, Emma.
I'm not leaving you, you hear me?

01:14:24.686 --> 01:14:26.748
I love you guys.

01:14:26.848 --> 01:14:29.224
What? What?

01:14:29.324 --> 01:14:32.441
- Hey, you son of a bitch!
- Sarah...

01:14:39.683 --> 01:14:41.371
I'm over here!

01:14:44.271 --> 01:14:46.039
Sarah!

01:14:48.675 --> 01:14:50.798
Hey!

01:14:55.549 --> 01:14:56.832
Hey!

01:14:57.952 --> 01:15:00.303
Come and get me!

01:15:14.268 --> 01:15:17.936
Shh! Emma, shh.

01:15:27.548 --> 01:15:30.851
Come on! I'm down here!

01:15:45.066 --> 01:15:47.569
Hey! I'm over here!

01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:50.455
Come and get me, you son of a bitch!

01:16:05.519 --> 01:16:07.906
I'm in here!

01:16:08.006 --> 01:16:10.242
Come and get me!

01:16:10.342 --> 01:16:12.575
I'm in here!

01:16:43.127 --> 01:16:45.035
Sarah!

01:16:48.231 --> 01:16:50.381
- Sarah!
- No!

01:16:50.732 --> 01:16:52.565
Emma!

01:16:56.303 --> 01:16:58.273
Emma, don't!

01:16:58.773 --> 01:17:00.640
Emma!

01:17:06.581 --> 01:17:08.450
Sarah!

01:17:13.288 --> 01:17:15.855
Sarah. Sarah!

01:17:20.256 --> 01:17:22.748
Sarah! Sarah.

01:17:30.571 --> 01:17:32.304
No!

01:17:33.354 --> 01:17:35.174
Sarah!

01:17:37.575 --> 01:17:39.548
Emma. Emma, go.

01:17:39.648 --> 01:17:43.232
- No, no!
- Emma, run, and don't look back.

01:17:43.332 --> 01:17:47.189
Go hide. Hide, and don't come out
until the sun comes up.

01:17:48.407 --> 01:17:52.141
- Marley?
- Emma, go!

01:18:01.168 --> 01:18:04.271
Hey! Asshole!

01:18:05.306 --> 01:18:07.275
Come on.

01:18:07.675 --> 01:18:09.736
Come on!

01:18:23.572 --> 01:18:25.468
Emma?

01:18:25.568 --> 01:18:29.194
- Emma.
- Marley! It's after me!

01:18:29.294 --> 01:18:32.933
- It's after me!
- Hey!

01:18:37.838 --> 01:18:39.572
Hey!

01:18:42.409 --> 01:18:45.247
Take me, you son of a bitch!

01:19:11.221 --> 01:19:14.852
If I'm going to die,
then I'm taking you with me!

01:20:23.044 --> 01:20:24.878
Marley!

01:20:26.747 --> 01:20:31.370
No, no, no. Marley, please,
please, don't leave me.

01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:34.375
Marley, please, don't leave me all alone!

01:20:49.336 --> 01:20:50.752
You're alive.

01:20:50.852 --> 01:20:53.958
I told you to stay hidden
until the sun was up.

01:20:54.058 --> 01:20:56.506
I did. It's almost morning.

01:20:58.979 --> 01:21:03.057
- You need to go for help.
- No. No, I'm not leaving you.

01:21:03.157 --> 01:21:05.520
- I need you to bring help.
- But...

01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:08.490
If I don't get help,
I'm probably going to...

01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:13.840
No, don't... don't say that, okay?
I'll... I'll go.

01:21:15.729 --> 01:21:18.451
We're going to be okay, Em.

01:21:19.883 --> 01:21:21.965
Promise me.

01:21:24.705 --> 01:21:26.719
I promise.

01:22:22.445 --> 01:22:24.549
I'm sorry, Em.

01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:31.804
Hey! The sun is up!

01:22:32.004 --> 01:22:36.060
- Time to die, you bastard!
- Emma, what are you doing? Run!

01:23:15.482 --> 01:23:17.749
What are you doing?

01:23:18.035 --> 01:23:20.413
We're going home.
