I want to thank you
and your friends

02:17.267 --> 02:19.443
Well, here.

02:19.487 --> 02:21.967
No, no. Just knowing Bob
was enough.

Midlife crisis?

03:49.968 --> 03:52.623
I've had this bike
since I was 29.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.364
Oh, yours hit early.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.801
They call me in on my day
off to listen to your stand-up,

03:56.845 --> 03:58.281
or you got a body to show me?

03:58.325 --> 03:59.369
Can't we do both?

03:59.413 --> 04:01.545
Right.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.852
Heavy rains last week
must have uncovered it.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.680
A group of hikers wandered
off the main trail

04:05.723 --> 04:08.248
this morning and spotted this.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.858
Looks like a body dump.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.642
Been here about four
or five years.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.296
Victim appears to be
an adult male.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.039
Hands were bound.

04:17.082 --> 04:19.563
Bullet hole in the temple
suggests this was an execution,

04:19.607 --> 04:21.173
so maybe Yakuza or Triads?

04:21.217 --> 04:23.741
No, they're pros.

04:23.785 --> 04:26.266
This was amateur hour.

04:26.309 --> 04:29.269
The shallow grave, teeth intact.

04:29.312 --> 04:30.835
Shell casing left with the body.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.750
That's not all they left.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.363
We found this phone
in the victim's pocket.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.408
Using mobile forensics,
we determined that

04:38.452 --> 04:41.193
the battery died on
March 2, 2018,

04:41.237 --> 04:42.891
at 1:38 a.m.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.109
We're out of cell range,

04:44.153 --> 04:45.241
so it would've drained
pretty quickly

04:45.285 --> 04:46.503
searching for a signal.

04:46.547 --> 04:47.852
Even fully charged,
it'd be dead

04:47.896 --> 04:49.506
in three to six hours.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.029
Which puts the night
of March 1st

04:51.073 --> 04:52.770
as the probable time of death.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.381
Is there anything on there that
could help ID the victim?

04:54.424 --> 04:56.339
Still working on that.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.689
Memory's pretty degraded.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.474
But I was able to recover
a voice mail

05:00.517 --> 05:03.041
left about three days
before the phone died.

05:05.087 --> 05:07.394
Sebastian Nuzo.

05:07.437 --> 05:08.525
You know him?

05:08.569 --> 05:10.527
No, but I know someone who did.

05:17.055 --> 05:19.319
MAGNUM:Well, the card on
Bob's gift said:

05:19.362 --> 05:21.146
"Don't drink it alone."

05:21.190 --> 05:23.584
Well, you heard the man.
It's 5:00 somewhere.

05:23.627 --> 05:26.717
Yeah, I hope Bob won't
mind me going with ginger ale.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.763
I gotta fly a tour
in 30 minutes.

05:28.806 --> 05:30.460
Gotcha, buddy.

05:30.504 --> 05:31.592
Thank you, Ricky.

05:31.635 --> 05:35.247
Okay, to Bob, and the <i>'ohana</i>

05:35.291 --> 05:37.206
that helped me honor him today. Cheers.

05:37.249 --> 05:39.339
Cheers.

05:40.557 --> 05:41.602
That's excellent.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.735
Ow!

05:44.779 --> 05:46.128
Kumu!

05:46.171 --> 05:47.825
What?

05:47.869 --> 05:49.827
I've got a meeting to get to
at the Cultural Center.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.263
It's on my way. You want a ride?

05:51.307 --> 05:53.440
<i>Mahalo.</i>
Yeah, I gotta bail, too.

05:53.483 --> 05:55.442
Suzy and I are picking out some
paint for the baby's room.

05:55.485 --> 05:58.270
And I got a lunch date
with Mahina. Ooh.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.837
And I gotta help Cade
with his homework.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.796
So, later, alligator.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.275
- Bye.
- See you, guys.

06:03.319 --> 06:05.365
- See you.
- Thanks for coming.

06:10.065 --> 06:11.719
Okay, what is it?

06:11.762 --> 06:13.198
What do you mean?

06:13.242 --> 06:15.244
Your phone. What did you
not want me to see?

06:16.158 --> 06:18.769
Just tell me it doesn't have
anything to do with MI6.

06:18.813 --> 06:22.033
No, no, I assure you
it's nothing like that.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.558
Okay, well, come on. Spill.

06:26.298 --> 06:27.952
You remember Ella?

06:27.996 --> 06:30.607
The 12-year-old you helped crack
a triple homicide with.

06:30.651 --> 06:31.652
That's who you're texting?

06:31.695 --> 06:33.567
No, not her.

06:33.610 --> 06:36.918
It's her father, Cole.

06:36.961 --> 06:40.095
I mean,
we're just texting, okay?

06:40.138 --> 06:42.140
So there is absolutely nothing
to needle me about.

06:42.184 --> 06:44.752
And you can wipe away
that silly grin.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.841
This grin isn't because there's
something to needle you about.

06:46.884 --> 06:49.452
It's because there could be
something to needle you about

06:49.496 --> 06:52.237
in the future, and...
I look forward to that.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.501
Right. Wow,
what an exciting life

06:54.544 --> 06:55.893
you do lead, Thomas.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.155
Mm.

07:00.158 --> 07:04.206
Hey, Gordie, what's going on?
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

07:04.249 --> 07:08.471
Uh, we'll be right down. Okay.

07:08.515 --> 07:09.690
What's up?

07:09.733 --> 07:11.735
Gordie says he wants
to talk to me

07:11.779 --> 07:13.215
down at the station.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.173
- Just you? What's it about?
- I don't know.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.132
He didn't say.

07:23.181 --> 07:24.618
Have a seat.

07:29.666 --> 07:33.583
Okay, look, I-I think I know
what this is about,

07:33.627 --> 07:35.280
and I know technically
it's a crime

07:35.324 --> 07:36.717
to use a fake badge,

07:36.760 --> 07:39.110
but I never said I was a cop.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.198
So...

07:42.940 --> 07:44.855
- That's not what this is about.
- No.

07:44.899 --> 07:47.945
Okay, well, just forget
what I said.

07:47.989 --> 07:51.775
Gladly. But I do need to
ask you some questions.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.473
HPD recovered a body
this morning.

07:53.516 --> 07:54.996
Homicide from four years ago.

07:55.039 --> 07:56.824
There was a voice mail
on the victim's phone

07:56.867 --> 07:59.130
from Sebastian Nuzo.

07:59.174 --> 08:01.002
Thomas!

08:09.010 --> 08:10.054
Oh, Nuzo...

08:11.708 --> 08:12.970
Four years ago?

08:13.014 --> 08:15.538
That was around the time
Nuzo was killed.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.540
You think this could be
connected?

08:17.584 --> 08:19.847
Well, this is about six months
before Nuzo died,

08:19.890 --> 08:22.414
but I am wondering if there's
a different kind of connection.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.505
Hey, it's Nuzo. Look,

08:25.548 --> 08:27.071
you're not returning
my phone calls,

08:27.115 --> 08:28.551
so let me just make this clear.
You think you can

08:28.595 --> 08:30.422
double-cross me?
When I find your sorry ass,

08:30.466 --> 08:31.772
there's gonna be hell to pay.

08:34.252 --> 08:35.950
Three days after
receiving this message,

08:35.993 --> 08:37.691
the victim was shot in the head.

08:37.734 --> 08:41.564
And right now, Sebastian Nuzo
is the prime suspect.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.545
Look, I know how it sounds,

09:05.588 --> 09:08.417
but there's no way Nuzo had
anything to do with the murder.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.897
I know he was your friend, Magnum,

09:09.940 --> 09:11.333
but I can't ignore evidence.

09:11.376 --> 09:12.943
I'm not asking you
to ignore evidence.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.031
I'm just saying you don't have
all the evidence.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.991
Who was this guy anyway?

09:17.034 --> 09:18.601
Well, we're still waiting
on Forensics to confirm,

09:18.645 --> 09:19.950
but the cell's SIM card

09:19.994 --> 09:21.691
and a four-year-old
missing persons report

09:21.735 --> 09:24.607
have tentatively ID'd the victim
as Bruce Fletcher.

09:26.653 --> 09:30.047
You ever meet him, or hear
Nuzo talk about him?

09:31.962 --> 09:33.398
No. No.

09:33.442 --> 09:35.052
Nuzo never mentioned the guy,

09:35.096 --> 09:37.838
but if I can think of anything,
I'll let you know.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.775
Why'd you just lie for me?

10:01.818 --> 10:03.603
You know why.

10:03.646 --> 10:06.388
I'm not telling him about
your history with Fletcher

10:06.431 --> 10:09.391
until I have the whole picture.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.393
We both know
you didn't kill him.

10:11.436 --> 10:13.874
Do we, though?
I mean, come on.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.049
You heard that voice mail.

10:15.092 --> 10:18.226
Okay, smart guy,
how'd you do it?

10:18.269 --> 10:19.923
How the hell should I know?

10:19.967 --> 10:22.273
I'm just your memories, pal.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.624
If you really want to know
who killed that guy...

10:26.582 --> 10:28.105
I'm gonna have to
find out myself.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.281
So you gonna take the case?

10:43.207 --> 10:45.732
Hey.
Yo.

10:45.775 --> 10:48.038
Hey, guys.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.170
Thanks for coming.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.562
Did you talk to
Katsumoto yet?

10:50.606 --> 10:52.216
Yeah, about
30 minutes ago.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.435
And he called me right after.

10:53.478 --> 10:54.871
He play you the voice mail?

10:54.915 --> 10:56.003
Yeah. And I told him
he's out of his mind

10:56.046 --> 10:58.440
- if he thinks Nuzo did this.
- Same here.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.485
I have no idea who
this Fletcher dude is,

11:00.529 --> 11:02.139
or why Nuzo would
leave that message.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.491
But you do, don't you?

11:06.535 --> 11:09.059
So what did you not tell Gordon
that you're gonna tell us?

11:12.410 --> 11:15.109
About four years ago,
Nuzo comes to me

11:15.152 --> 11:18.112
and he asks me to find
Bruce Fletcher.

11:19.243 --> 11:20.331
And did you?

11:20.375 --> 11:22.203
Yeah. He was a salvage diver

11:22.246 --> 11:24.248
who worked on and off
for Nuzo.

11:24.292 --> 11:26.120
About a month before
that voice mail,

11:26.163 --> 11:28.339
he borrowed $2,000 and a bunch
of diving equipment from Nuzo

11:28.383 --> 11:29.776
and then ghosted him.

11:29.819 --> 11:31.647
It looks like you managed
to track him down.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.214
Wasn't easy, either.

11:33.257 --> 11:34.998
He had been evicted
from his apartment,

11:35.042 --> 11:36.652
stopped answering his phone.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.262
But I found out he was
a fitness fanatic,

11:38.306 --> 11:39.873
so I staked out his gym.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.831
From there,
I tracked him to a bar.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.703
The guy hits the metal,

11:43.746 --> 11:45.052
then goes drinking?

11:45.095 --> 11:46.706
That's a strange
post-workout routine.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.099
Well, tell that to the ladies
who have "lava flow lunch"

11:49.143 --> 11:51.449
at La Mariana every Wednesday
after CrossFit.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.756
And then I tailed him
to a friend's house

11:53.800 --> 11:55.105
that he had been crashing at,

11:55.149 --> 11:57.064
and I gave Nuzo the address.

11:57.107 --> 11:59.283
And then Nuzo went to see him?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.069
I-I don't, I don't know.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.810
I checked in about
a week later,

12:03.853 --> 12:06.421
and Nuzo just said that
he handled it.

12:06.464 --> 12:09.772
Right. So now the police think
that by "handling it,"

12:09.816 --> 12:11.818
it meant that Nuzo had
killed Fletcher.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.776
We all know Nuzo
didn't do this.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.778
But if HPD thinks he did,

12:15.822 --> 12:17.606
it could destroy his memory.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.913
I mean, they could strip him
of his military honors,

12:19.956 --> 12:21.828
even cut of benefits
to Lara and Jake.

12:21.871 --> 12:24.787
We're not gonna
let that happen.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.093
I'm gonna look deeper into

12:26.136 --> 12:27.747
Nuzo and Fletcher's
relationship.

12:27.790 --> 12:30.401
Higgins, if you can dive into
Fletcher's digital footprint.

12:30.445 --> 12:31.620
Give me the friend's address.

12:31.663 --> 12:32.664
I'll see what I can
find out about him.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.536
And TC and I,
we'll hit the gym.

12:34.579 --> 12:35.537
Track down his buddies.

12:35.580 --> 12:36.581
Maybe they'll talk to us

12:36.625 --> 12:37.495
if they won't talk
to the police.

12:37.539 --> 12:38.845
Yeah, I'd like to see who else

12:38.888 --> 12:40.324
might have had it out
for Fletcher.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.457
There's just one thing
you're forgetting, Magnum.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.285
You have to go back
and tell Gordon the truth.

12:44.328 --> 12:45.982
Yeah, TM,

12:46.026 --> 12:49.159
I trust your instincts,
but Gordie is <i>'ohana.</i>

12:49.203 --> 12:51.118
I think it'd be okay
to bring him in on this.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.294
You absolutely have to
bring him in on this.

12:53.337 --> 12:55.470
If he finds out
you lied to him,

12:55.513 --> 12:58.081
which he will,
he's not gonna be happy.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.343
Exactly.

12:59.387 --> 13:01.084
But we know that Nuzo
didn't do this,

13:01.128 --> 13:02.782
so we shouldn't be afraid
of the facts.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.696
I'm not afraid of the facts.

13:04.740 --> 13:07.395
I'm afraid of what the police,
even a good cop like Katsumoto,

13:07.438 --> 13:09.353
will do if they don't
have all the facts.

13:09.397 --> 13:12.052
Nuzo's not here
to defend himself,

13:12.095 --> 13:13.923
so we're gonna have to
do it for him.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.969
I'm going to see Lara.

13:17.492 --> 13:19.842
Thomas, can I talk
to you for a sec?

13:19.886 --> 13:21.148
About?

13:21.191 --> 13:23.585
Well, you're clearly
upset about this.

13:23.628 --> 13:24.847
I think we all are... Higgins,

13:24.891 --> 13:26.675
I'm fine.

13:42.386 --> 13:45.781
I get you lying
to Katsumoto,

13:45.825 --> 13:47.478
but lying to Higgy, too?

13:47.522 --> 13:48.740
What lie? I didn't lie.

13:48.784 --> 13:50.873
"I'm fine, Higgins."

13:50.917 --> 13:52.570
Come on.

13:52.614 --> 13:55.269
- I am fine.
- Oh, yeah.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.531
You're just peachy.

13:56.574 --> 13:58.054
What are you doing here anyway?

13:58.098 --> 14:01.188
It's your subconscious, pal.
You tell me.

14:01.231 --> 14:02.493
But they're not wrong,
you know.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.147
You should have told
Katsumoto the truth.

14:04.191 --> 14:06.236
Dude's had your back
more times than I can count.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.455
You never even met the man.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.239
Hello?!

14:09.283 --> 14:10.937
Subconscious.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.939
Look, Gordie doesn't know
how wrong he is

14:12.982 --> 14:14.201
because he didn't know you.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.899
But he knows you.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.336
And a good cop could be
a real ally here.

14:19.380 --> 14:21.730
So why not tell him
everything?

14:21.773 --> 14:24.907
Unless there's
a small part of you

14:24.951 --> 14:26.953
that wonders if
I really did it.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.262
No. No, absolutely not.

14:32.306 --> 14:35.613
I mean, Jules, Rick,
TC, Kumu.

14:35.657 --> 14:38.051
They're all sure
I didn't do it.

14:39.704 --> 14:42.055
But then again, they don't
know me like you did.

14:42.098 --> 14:44.709
They weren't there
that day at Tora Bora.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.711
Remember?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.680
Cover!

14:58.723 --> 15:00.943
Cover. Take cover!

15:03.641 --> 15:05.469
They were coming at us <i>
from all sides.</i>

15:05.513 --> 15:07.776
<i>I had to go hand to hand.</i>

15:11.388 --> 15:13.260
<i>And I went full beast.</i>

15:13.303 --> 15:15.610
<i>Killed a lot of hostiles,</i> <i>
one with his own knife.</i>

15:24.967 --> 15:26.751
After seeing all that,

15:26.795 --> 15:28.710
do you really think
I couldn't murder somebody?

15:28.753 --> 15:30.494
That was different.
That was...

15:32.453 --> 15:33.671
That was war.

15:33.715 --> 15:36.761
Yeah. But it was still me.

15:38.807 --> 15:40.504
Hey.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.202
Hey. Is now... Is now what?

15:42.245 --> 15:44.073
Um, an okay time?

15:44.117 --> 15:45.945
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.556
Look, even though we disagree
about Gordon, I just want to say

15:48.599 --> 15:50.297
I really appreciate your help
on this, Higgy.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.734
Well, we'll see
how appreciative you are

15:52.777 --> 15:53.996
once I tell you what I found.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.998
So I hacked into Fletcher's

15:56.042 --> 15:58.827
old email, and I found a thread
between him and Nuzo.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.960
Don't tell me there's
a threatening email, too.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.918
Thankfully no,
but it appears that

16:02.962 --> 16:04.267
the loan of the equipment
and the money

16:04.311 --> 16:05.660
was part of a larger deal.

16:05.703 --> 16:08.663
Nuzo was staking Fletcher
to scout a wreck.

16:08.706 --> 16:11.144
If he found it, they were gonna
split the salvage fee.

16:11.187 --> 16:12.580
What was the wreck?

16:12.623 --> 16:14.016
The emails didn't say.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.887
They must have discussed it
in person.

16:15.931 --> 16:19.630
But I mean, even a modest fee
can be over $50,000.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.981
Oh, I know.
Nuzo was making bank

16:22.024 --> 16:23.286
while I was pounding
the pavement

16:23.330 --> 16:25.027
chasing down cheating spouses.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.376
But you see my point.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.161
If Nuzo was expecting
a salvage fee

16:28.204 --> 16:29.945
from his deal with Fletcher,
then there was considerably

16:29.989 --> 16:32.992
more at stake than some
equipment and a little money.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.645
Yeah, I know, just...

16:34.689 --> 16:37.126
don't tell Katsumoto yet,
okay, please?

16:37.170 --> 16:39.476
Magnum...

16:39.520 --> 16:42.218
I'm almost at Nuzo's business.
I just want to get to Lara

16:42.262 --> 16:43.915
before HPD ambushes her.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.005
Yeah. Fine.
But we both know

16:46.048 --> 16:47.310
it's just a matter of time until...

16:47.354 --> 16:48.833
Looks like time's up.

16:48.877 --> 16:50.313
I'll call you back.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.931
- Lara.
- Thomas!

16:59.975 --> 17:01.150
They just showed up
with a warrant.

17:01.194 --> 17:02.369
Do you know what
this is about?

17:02.412 --> 17:03.413
It's all a big misunderstanding,

17:03.457 --> 17:04.762
but I'm getting it cleared up.

17:04.806 --> 17:05.937
They're going through everything.

17:05.981 --> 17:07.026
No, I know.
Don't worry about it.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.288
I'll handle it.

17:10.855 --> 17:12.335
Really, Gordie?

17:12.379 --> 17:13.815
You're doing
the full-court press

17:13.858 --> 17:15.077
on the widow of
a decorated veteran?

17:15.121 --> 17:16.687
Hasn't she been
through enough?

17:16.731 --> 17:18.776
I already told you
Nuzo didn't do this.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.648
The evidence doesn't
support that.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.519
The ropes that bound
Fletcher's hands and feet

17:22.563 --> 17:24.565
are a match for the dock line
Nuzo's company uses.

17:24.608 --> 17:25.827
That's what you got?
A dock line?

17:25.870 --> 17:27.089
That rope is probably a match

17:27.133 --> 17:28.351
for half the boats
on the island.

17:28.395 --> 17:29.657
We've also got financial records

17:29.700 --> 17:31.441
showing Nuzo gave Fletcher
$2,000

17:31.485 --> 17:33.313
as part of a deal
to search for a salvage.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.099
According to Nuzo's notes,
they were looking for

17:37.143 --> 17:38.883
the <i>Murakami Maru,</i>
a Japanese ship...

17:38.927 --> 17:40.798
That went down during
World War II, I know.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.148
He was convinced it sank
off Oahu.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.932
It was his white whale.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.803
Mm-hmm.
I kind of figured.

17:45.847 --> 17:48.284
The salvage on a ship like that
would be a huge payday.

17:48.328 --> 17:50.634
So instead of having 2,000
reasons to want Fletcher dead,

17:50.678 --> 17:52.201
Nuzo might have had
several million.

17:52.245 --> 17:53.594
Except Nuzo didn't need
the money.

17:53.637 --> 17:55.422
And we know he didn't
kill anybody.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.119
You'll have to forgive me if
I don't take your word for it,

17:57.163 --> 17:58.903
seeing as that you've already
lied to me once today.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.993
HPD dug up a series
of four-year-old texts

18:02.037 --> 18:03.995
between you and Nuzo
in which he asks you

18:04.039 --> 18:06.172
to track down Fletcher
three days before he was killed.

18:06.215 --> 18:07.608
So let's try this again.

18:07.651 --> 18:09.175
Did you ever meet
Bruce Fletcher,

18:09.218 --> 18:11.220
or did Sebastian Nuzo ever
mention him to you?

18:18.140 --> 18:20.925
When I checked back later
with Nuzo, he just said

18:20.969 --> 18:23.319
everything had been resolved.

18:23.363 --> 18:24.668
That's all I know.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.499
Really. And, look, Gordie,
it's not that I don't trust you,

18:29.543 --> 18:32.154
but we both know how this looks.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.765
Nuzo, he was my brother.

18:34.809 --> 18:37.072
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to clear him.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.205
Look, I get it.
But you do realize

18:39.248 --> 18:41.032
you've made this look worse
for him, right?

18:41.076 --> 18:42.730
When people lie
to protect someone,

18:42.773 --> 18:44.340
it's usually because they think
that person did it.

18:44.384 --> 18:47.561
No, I've been telling the truth
about that from the beginning.

18:47.604 --> 18:48.605
Nuzo didn't do this.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.085
And I hope you're right.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.521
But by concealing evidence,

18:51.565 --> 18:53.175
you've made him that much
more of a suspect.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.095
Ballistics report.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.879
The shell casings found
with Fletcher's body

19:01.923 --> 19:04.317
came from nine-millimeter
Luger NATO rounds.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.579
Standard ammo...

19:05.622 --> 19:07.711
Of Navy SEALs. Yeah, I know.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.235
You also know anybody can
buy those rounds.

19:09.278 --> 19:10.497
It doesn't mean anything.

19:10.540 --> 19:11.759
Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.195
But I'm still dutybound

19:13.239 --> 19:14.805
to follow the truth
wherever it leads.

19:14.849 --> 19:16.764
And if you get in my way again,
I'll throw your ass in jail.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.026
Are we clear?

19:18.069 --> 19:19.419
Do what you gotta do.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.508
Go honor your friend's
memory, Magnum.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.510
I'll honor the facts.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.088
Uh, you all right?

19:37.132 --> 19:38.568
Hell no.

19:38.612 --> 19:40.266
I worked out
for five hours today

19:40.309 --> 19:42.920
trying to connect with one of
Fletcher's old gym buddies.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.487
And nothing?

19:44.531 --> 19:45.967
No.

19:46.010 --> 19:49.057
Rick's there now covering
the evening crowd.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.234
What's that you got there?

19:52.278 --> 19:53.670
Oh, it's Bruce Fletcher's
autopsy.

19:53.714 --> 19:56.499
Unfortunately there is
nothing in there

19:56.543 --> 19:57.935
that's gonna help clear
Nuzo's name.

19:57.979 --> 20:00.199
So TM finally came clean
with Gordie, huh?

20:00.242 --> 20:02.026
Yeah. He didn't really
have a choice.

20:02.070 --> 20:05.508
Mm. Yeah, he is pretty
spun out about this.

20:05.552 --> 20:08.685
Well, I imagine you
and Rick are as well.

20:08.729 --> 20:12.689
Yeah, but Thomas and Nuzo,
they were tight

20:12.733 --> 20:14.430
before we all met
in the sandbox.

20:14.474 --> 20:16.084
Came up in SEALs together.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.956
Saved each other's lives
a dozen times.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.828
If the two of them
hadn't met,

20:20.871 --> 20:23.265
none of us would even
know each other.

20:23.309 --> 20:24.962
Hmm.

20:25.006 --> 20:27.835
I also suspect Thomas has
never really forgiven himself

20:27.878 --> 20:29.663
for failing to save
Nuzo's life.

20:29.706 --> 20:31.404
Oh, I know he hasn't.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.014
You can see it in his eyes
every time someone

20:33.057 --> 20:34.494
brings up the man's name.

20:34.537 --> 20:37.148
It's just one more reason
I wish we could find

20:37.192 --> 20:39.281
something that would help.

20:39.325 --> 20:42.153
It just seems like
every detail we uncover

20:42.197 --> 20:43.894
makes it look worse for Nuzo.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.200
Ow, ow, ow,

20:45.244 --> 20:47.594
- ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
- Hi.

20:47.637 --> 20:49.726
Dude,

20:49.770 --> 20:52.120
the gym is open for
another three hours.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.469
You throwing in the towel
already?

20:53.513 --> 20:54.905
Listen, I did
so many curls

20:54.949 --> 20:57.560
I can't even lift
a towel right now, okay?

20:57.604 --> 21:00.346
But no pain, no gain,
and I hit pay dirt.

21:00.389 --> 21:02.609
Okay, I met one of
Fletcher's gym buddies.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.524
He told me right before
he disappeared,

21:04.567 --> 21:06.221
Fletcher said all his
money troubles

21:06.265 --> 21:07.483
were about to be over.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.577
So if Fletcher was talking about
making bank,

21:14.621 --> 21:16.840
he was either counting
his chickens,

21:16.884 --> 21:18.581
or he actually found the wreck
he was looking for.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.280
Yeah. That might explain
why he ghosted Nuzo.

21:21.323 --> 21:24.239
Perhaps Fletcher was planning
on cutting Nuzo out of the deal.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.285
And if Nuzo found out...

21:26.328 --> 21:28.069
No, no, you were right
about Nuzo this morning.

21:28.112 --> 21:30.593
He didn't do this, and the facts
are gonna prove that.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.769
Uh, speaking of this morning,

21:32.813 --> 21:35.337
I-I'm sorry if I upset you.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.905
No, Higgins, it's fine.

21:37.948 --> 21:41.517
I mean, who knows, maybe...
maybe you're right.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.302
Maybe I should have told Katsumoto.

21:43.345 --> 21:46.522
You never listen to
anything I say,

21:46.566 --> 21:50.396
but in this instance I can
understand you not wanting to.

21:52.049 --> 21:55.749
Nuzo was special to everyone,
but particularly you.

21:55.792 --> 22:00.319
Yeah. He was.

22:01.494 --> 22:06.542
Are you sure you don't want
to just... talk?

22:06.586 --> 22:09.023
No, I want to look back through
everything we have

22:09.066 --> 22:10.503
and just make sure there's not

22:10.546 --> 22:13.157
some angle we're missing.

22:13.201 --> 22:16.900
And then just hit it fresh
in the morning.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.685
Okay.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.078
Well, good night, then.

22:21.122 --> 22:22.558
Good night, Higgins.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.928
What the hell is
wrong with you?

22:44.972 --> 22:47.714
You got a living, breathing,
flesh-and-blood person

22:47.757 --> 22:50.020
who cares about you
to hash this out with.

22:50.064 --> 22:53.023
And instead, you're sitting here
with your imaginary friend.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.808
I thought you were
my subconscious.

22:54.851 --> 22:57.158
Where do you think imaginary
friends come from, smartass?

22:58.986 --> 23:01.162
Look, we both know
you're a mess inside.

23:01.205 --> 23:04.557
All I'm saying is maybe a little
heart-to-heart with Higgy

23:04.600 --> 23:05.819
will set you straight.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.647
There's nothing to talk about.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.039
You didn't do this.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.867
And tomorrow I'm gonna
find out who did.

23:10.911 --> 23:12.695
Come on, Thomas.

23:12.739 --> 23:15.437
If it wasn't me,
if this was any other case,

23:15.481 --> 23:16.960
who would you think
killed that guy?

23:17.004 --> 23:19.398
- But it's not any other case.
- Sure it is.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.225
A man's dead.

23:21.269 --> 23:22.705
And like Katsumoto,

23:22.749 --> 23:24.098
you should be following
the facts.

23:24.141 --> 23:26.317
- I am.
- The hell you are.

23:26.361 --> 23:28.668
You don't want to admit
how this all looks because

23:28.711 --> 23:30.104
you only want to remember
the good things.

23:30.147 --> 23:31.845
No, I remember everything
about you.

23:31.888 --> 23:34.021
No. No.

23:34.064 --> 23:36.980
You can't deal with the fact
that I was just a man,

23:37.024 --> 23:39.374
messy and complicated,
like anybody else.

23:40.506 --> 23:43.639
That I had a temper.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.511
And that I absolutely
could have.

23:45.554 --> 23:48.209
No, I knew you
better than anybody.

23:48.252 --> 23:49.950
And you know what, I still
couldn't protect you

23:49.993 --> 23:52.343
when you died, but I'm damn sure
gonna protect your memory.

23:52.387 --> 23:56.043
Right. Of course.
I forgot.

23:56.086 --> 23:58.915
- My death is about you.
- Come on!

23:58.959 --> 24:00.874
Look, spin your wheels
all you want, brother.

24:00.917 --> 24:03.398
At the end of the day,
I am still dead!

24:03.442 --> 24:05.574
But you shouldn't be.
All right?

24:05.618 --> 24:07.489
You shouldn't be.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.230
You should still be here.

24:09.273 --> 24:10.449
And if you were,
this whole thing

24:10.492 --> 24:11.493
would have been
cleared up by now.

24:11.537 --> 24:12.799
But you're not.
You're gone.

24:12.842 --> 24:14.670
All right, you're dead.

24:14.714 --> 24:17.630
And I'm still here alone.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.893
And I gotta find
some way to fix this.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.875
Okay, so this is
the friend's place

24:45.919 --> 24:47.442
Fletcher was staying.

24:48.574 --> 24:50.314
Kumu looked into him yesterday.

24:50.358 --> 24:53.927
Oscar Woods, 36,
divorced, no kids.

24:53.970 --> 24:56.103
If Fletcher was talking about
coming into money,

24:56.146 --> 24:57.713
maybe he gave Oscar
more details.

24:57.757 --> 24:59.236
Yeah.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.154
You're not coming?

25:04.198 --> 25:06.940
Uh, no.

25:06.983 --> 25:08.637
About four years ago,
Oscar caught me

25:08.681 --> 25:10.073
snooping around his property

25:10.117 --> 25:11.597
and kind of ran me off
with a shotgun.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.860
So I've got a hunch
he's gonna remember me.

25:13.903 --> 25:16.776
Right. Well, best keep
the engine running then

25:16.819 --> 25:18.691
in case I get the same response.

25:29.179 --> 25:30.703
Hi there.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.445
Whatever you're selling,
I'll pass.

25:34.489 --> 25:35.882
I'm late for work.

25:35.925 --> 25:38.449
Well, I'm actually
a private investigator

25:38.493 --> 25:40.756
working on behalf
of Bruce Fletcher's family.

25:40.800 --> 25:44.804
I assume you heard
his body was found.

25:44.847 --> 25:48.851
Yeah. Police came by here yesterday.

25:48.895 --> 25:52.289
Told them everything I know,
which wasn't much.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.465
Bruce and I weren't close.

25:54.509 --> 25:57.468
I just let him crash here when
he needed a place to stay.

25:57.512 --> 25:59.558
Right. Did he mention

25:59.601 --> 26:01.342
anything about coming
into some money

26:01.385 --> 26:03.300
before he disappeared?

26:03.344 --> 26:05.433
Not that I remember.

26:05.476 --> 26:06.869
Well, did you happen to
hang on to

26:06.913 --> 26:08.262
any of his possessions?

26:08.305 --> 26:10.786
Nope. Sorry.

26:10.830 --> 26:13.484
Nothing at all?
You're absolutely certain?

26:13.528 --> 26:16.749
Look, I dropped it all
at the Goodwill on Puuloa

26:16.792 --> 26:18.664
about six months after
he went MIA.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.710
- I gotta go.
- All right.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.843
Well, thanks.

26:38.248 --> 26:40.468
FYI, this is exactly what I was
doing four years ago

26:40.511 --> 26:42.470
when he ran me off
with a shotgun.

26:42.513 --> 26:43.950
Well, then, you'll
be glad to know that

26:43.993 --> 26:46.039
Kumu's research revealed
that Oscar works

26:46.082 --> 26:47.649
12-hour shifts at
Port of Honolulu,

26:47.693 --> 26:48.955
so he'll be gone for ages.

26:48.998 --> 26:51.087
Why do you think
Fletcher's stuff is here?

26:51.131 --> 26:52.785
Well, I just checked
the local business records,

26:52.828 --> 26:55.526
and there was no Goodwill
on Puuloa four years ago.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.224
So he was lying about
Fletcher's stuff.

26:57.267 --> 26:58.791
And when I first
mentioned Fletcher,

26:58.834 --> 27:01.010
he started staring
at this shed.

27:24.207 --> 27:26.035
Hey.

27:26.079 --> 27:27.820
Could this be Fletcher's?

27:29.909 --> 27:32.520
Most experienced divers
keep their dog tags

27:32.563 --> 27:33.782
on their BC.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.394
It's Fletcher's.

27:40.441 --> 27:42.269
Let's see if something
in all this can tell us

27:42.312 --> 27:44.488
who else knew he was gonna
come into some money.

27:44.532 --> 27:46.577
Or who might have killed him
to get it.

27:50.843 --> 27:52.975
- Hang on.
- What?

27:53.019 --> 27:55.412
Well, you're supposed to
store these tanks pressurized.

27:55.456 --> 27:56.544
It keeps the moisture out.

27:56.587 --> 27:57.545
They can hold it for years.

27:57.588 --> 27:58.764
But this one's empty,

27:58.807 --> 27:59.852
and the top's not even

27:59.895 --> 28:01.114
screwed in properly, it's...

28:03.072 --> 28:04.204
Wait.

28:14.954 --> 28:16.259
It's a nautical chart.

28:16.303 --> 28:18.784
These dates correspond
to the weeks

28:18.827 --> 28:20.263
before Fletcher was murdered.

28:20.307 --> 28:21.700
He was doing a grid search.

28:21.743 --> 28:23.614
Checking off a square
with each dive.

28:23.658 --> 28:25.268
He was definitely searching
for something.

28:27.096 --> 28:29.229
Look, this last date,

28:29.272 --> 28:32.406
that's five days before
he disappeared.

28:32.449 --> 28:34.800
Whatever he was looking for,
maybe he found it.

28:34.843 --> 28:37.890
Hold on. This is for
the windward side of the island.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.021
So?

28:39.065 --> 28:40.283
So Nuzo and everybody searching

28:40.327 --> 28:41.850
for the <i>Murakami Maru</i>

28:41.894 --> 28:43.678
thought that the boat sank
on the leeward side.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.898
If he wasn't looking for
Sebastian's white whale,

28:45.941 --> 28:47.203
what was he looking for?

28:48.770 --> 28:50.903
There's only one way
to find out.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.872
Okay, we're approaching
the location on Fletcher's map.

29:04.873 --> 29:08.834
Okay... here we are.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.883
So what do you think
is down there?

29:14.927 --> 29:18.408
Well, either Fletcher got a lead
that the <i>Murakami Maru</i> sank

29:18.452 --> 29:20.280
in a different location,

29:20.323 --> 29:22.064
or they were looking for
another boat.

29:22.108 --> 29:24.588
Plenty of valuable ships have
gone down in these waters.

29:24.632 --> 29:25.764
Yeah, certainly have.

29:30.203 --> 29:32.466
Time to find out
what's down there.

30:42.275 --> 30:44.712
Photograph everything
and get it all back to the lab.

30:50.718 --> 30:52.938
The serial numbers and other IDs
have definitely rusted off,

30:52.981 --> 30:54.113
so the container's origin
and owner

30:54.156 --> 30:55.375
will be difficult to trace.

30:55.418 --> 30:57.507
What about the human remains?

30:57.551 --> 30:59.292
Not sure we'll have
any luck with that either.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.685
The fact that there are
children and adults in there

31:01.729 --> 31:03.383
suggests that this was
illegal immigration.

31:03.426 --> 31:06.038
Probably refugees from China,
North Korea, Myanmar.

31:06.081 --> 31:07.822
- Any number of any countries.
- HIGGINS:Yeah.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.693
Not the kind of places
that tend to cooperate

31:09.737 --> 31:11.260
with U.S. law enforcement.

31:11.304 --> 31:13.219
Or admit that some of their
citizens are desperate to leave.

31:13.262 --> 31:15.090
One thing's clear.
If Fletcher knew about

31:15.134 --> 31:16.570
the human trafficking,

31:16.613 --> 31:18.441
it's probably what
got him killed, right?

31:18.485 --> 31:20.443
So Nuzo should be
off the hook.

31:20.487 --> 31:23.055
Well, it definitely
helps his case.

31:23.098 --> 31:24.883
But right now I have
more questions than answers.

31:24.926 --> 31:27.233
Well, I would pose those
questions to Oscar Woods.

31:27.276 --> 31:28.974
The guy Fletcher was
staying with before he died.

31:29.017 --> 31:31.498
Yeah. He works with containers
just like this every day

31:31.541 --> 31:32.760
at Port of Honolulu.

31:35.110 --> 31:37.373
And since Nuzo's no longer
my prime suspect,

31:37.417 --> 31:39.767
can I work my case without
tripping over you every time

31:39.810 --> 31:40.986
I turn around?

31:41.029 --> 31:42.683
Yeah. I'll stay out of your way.

31:42.726 --> 31:44.598
Why don't I grab my tablet

31:44.641 --> 31:46.295
and give you everything that
we've got on Oscar Woods.

31:46.339 --> 31:47.906
Yeah.

31:52.562 --> 31:55.043
See? I told you
I didn't do this.

31:55.087 --> 31:58.090
Yeah. Case closed.

31:58.133 --> 32:00.744
Someone turned this container
into a crypt.

32:00.788 --> 32:03.617
Innocent people died. Kids!

32:05.401 --> 32:07.403
And you're just gonna
walk away?

32:07.447 --> 32:09.318
Well, you're in my head.

32:10.580 --> 32:11.799
You tell me.

32:14.758 --> 32:17.936
63 million square miles
of ocean,

32:17.979 --> 32:20.416
and your pal Fletcher
just happened to

32:20.460 --> 32:21.809
dive down and find this.

32:23.376 --> 32:25.856
You want to tell me how
he knew where to look?

32:25.900 --> 32:29.338
Thousands of containers
fall off ships every year.

32:29.382 --> 32:32.211
I don't know, maybe he just
stumbled across it.

32:32.254 --> 32:33.995
I checked the
harbor's records.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.954
No containers were reported
missing in that area

32:35.997 --> 32:37.956
for more than a year
before Fletcher's last dive.

32:37.999 --> 32:40.523
But there was a surprise
Coast Guard inspection

32:40.567 --> 32:42.221
of a container ship
headed into port

32:42.264 --> 32:44.832
just three weeks
before his death.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.921
The very next day,
Fletcher borrowed the money

32:46.965 --> 32:48.967
and equipment he'd need
to conduct a search.

32:49.010 --> 32:51.360
Look, I don't know
anything about that.

32:51.404 --> 32:52.448
Is that why you lied
about having

32:52.492 --> 32:53.493
his diving gear in your shed?

32:56.104 --> 32:57.540
You know what I think?

32:57.584 --> 32:58.802
I think you knew
about a smuggling operation

32:58.846 --> 33:00.195
at the harbor.

33:00.239 --> 33:01.980
You didn't know what
they were bringing in,

33:02.023 --> 33:03.590
but when you heard that
they had to ditch a container

33:03.633 --> 33:05.374
because of that inspection,
you thought

33:05.418 --> 33:07.289
whatever was down there had to
be pretty valuable, right?

33:09.291 --> 33:12.120
I think you told Fletcher,
and then he dove down

33:12.164 --> 33:14.079
to get whatever was inside so
the two of you could sell it.

33:14.122 --> 33:15.558
But when he got down there,

33:15.602 --> 33:18.257
he didn't find drugs
or guns or jewels.

33:19.388 --> 33:20.737
He found bodies.

33:23.262 --> 33:25.220
So what happened next?

33:27.353 --> 33:28.702
What did you and Fletcher do

33:28.745 --> 33:30.356
after he saw what was
in the container?

33:35.839 --> 33:37.406
I want a lawyer.

33:43.934 --> 33:46.067
We know Fletcher was broke,

33:46.111 --> 33:48.113
and he had information
that could bring down

33:48.156 --> 33:49.766
- a human trafficking ring.
- Right.

33:49.810 --> 33:51.594
So you think he found
the traffickers

33:51.638 --> 33:53.422
and demanded a payoff
to keep quiet.

33:53.466 --> 33:55.642
Yeah, and got a bullet
for it instead.

33:55.685 --> 33:56.904
That's a good theory,

33:56.947 --> 33:58.427
but we have no way
of confirming it.

33:58.471 --> 34:01.517
And you did just tell
Katsumoto that we'd be

34:01.561 --> 34:03.345
staying out of things
from now on, did you not?

34:03.389 --> 34:05.130
Yeah, but I didn't say
I wouldn't think about it.

34:05.173 --> 34:07.045
We're just talking.

34:07.088 --> 34:09.438
The traffickers, they've got to
be working at the harbor, right?

34:09.482 --> 34:13.399
Yeah, but Port of Honolulu
employs what, 6,000 workers?

34:13.442 --> 34:16.184
And HPD is already obtaining
the necessary warrants

34:16.228 --> 34:18.621
to scrutinize each one
of them, so...

34:18.665 --> 34:20.493
Yeah, but by the time they do,
the traffickers are gonna be

34:20.536 --> 34:22.277
halfway to Vietnam by then.

34:22.321 --> 34:23.844
Are you saying you have
a quicker way to identify them?

34:27.543 --> 34:29.719
Actually, I think I do.

34:29.763 --> 34:32.113
I was tailing Fletcher right
before he was killed, right?

34:32.157 --> 34:34.724
So if he met with the
traffickers to demand payment,

34:34.768 --> 34:37.162
- I might have a picture of it.
- Right.

34:37.205 --> 34:38.554
Can you run facial recognition

34:38.598 --> 34:39.947
on all the people around
Fletcher?

34:39.990 --> 34:41.644
Particularly the people
at the bar.

34:41.688 --> 34:44.517
Like TC said, that is a weird
post-workout routine.

34:44.560 --> 34:49.435
Yeah. Maybe he wasn't
just there to socialize.

34:49.478 --> 34:52.264
All right, I'm running the
faces against the DMV database.

34:52.307 --> 34:54.918
I can look deeper into them
once I get back some names.

34:56.268 --> 34:59.662
Okay, the bartender is
Morris Clark, 58.

34:59.706 --> 35:03.144
Some unpaid parking tickets
and a DUI.

35:03.188 --> 35:06.539
The man on Fletcher's right
is Chris Bowen, 46.

35:06.582 --> 35:10.020
Arrested for assault in '97.
Clean since.

35:10.064 --> 35:12.675
He works as a container
operations supervisor

35:12.719 --> 35:14.112
at Port of Honolulu.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.897
- I'll ping Bowen's mobile.
- I'll call Katsumoto.

35:23.382 --> 35:24.905
Looks like he's headed for
the marina in Kaneohe.

35:24.948 --> 35:27.560
Where he owns
a 48-foot catamaran.

35:27.603 --> 35:28.952
So maybe he knows
the police are closing in,

35:28.996 --> 35:30.171
and you were right about him

35:30.215 --> 35:31.825
getting the first boat
out of here.

35:31.868 --> 35:34.044
Hey, Gordie, I know I said
I would leave this alone,

35:34.088 --> 35:35.916
but I think we just ID'd
one of the traffickers.

35:35.959 --> 35:38.223
His name is Chris Bowen,
he works at the harbor.

35:38.266 --> 35:40.790
He's at Kaneohe Marina
right now, and in case

35:40.834 --> 35:42.140
you don't get this,
we're headed there.

36:01.550 --> 36:03.422
Going somewhere?

36:03.465 --> 36:06.207
I don't know who you are,
but you need to get off my boat.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.601
Why? I mean, it looks like
you got plenty of supplies.

36:08.644 --> 36:10.951
It's enough to get
to Vietnam, Cambodia...

36:10.994 --> 36:14.215
Indonesia-- basically anywhere
without extradition to the U.S.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.609
Not quite
enough for Indonesia.

36:16.652 --> 36:18.654
See, I'm not
traveling alone.

36:20.003 --> 36:21.440
Well, I'm sorry,

36:21.483 --> 36:22.919
Chris, but...

36:22.963 --> 36:24.617
we can't let you go.

36:24.660 --> 36:26.009
Not until you answer

36:26.053 --> 36:27.924
for Fletcher and all
the other people you killed.

36:27.968 --> 36:30.405
You don't know
what you're talking about.

36:33.626 --> 36:35.758
Well, considering
that the four of you

36:35.802 --> 36:37.020
are about to flee
the country

36:37.064 --> 36:39.153
rather than face
the consequences

36:39.197 --> 36:41.416
of human trafficking for years,
then I think we know enough.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.113
We were saving people,
all right?

36:43.157 --> 36:44.985
Got hundreds of people
out of terrible places

36:45.028 --> 36:46.291
and brought them here
for a better life.

36:46.334 --> 36:47.944
Right, and you charged
them through the nose,

36:47.988 --> 36:50.077
and bought yourself this
nice boat, didn't you?

36:50.120 --> 36:51.861
And sent 17 of them
to their deaths

36:51.905 --> 36:53.602
just to save
your own skin.

36:53.646 --> 36:55.996
Yeah, you're a real saint.

36:56.039 --> 36:57.911
You shut your mouth.

37:38.038 --> 37:40.170
Let's go, move.

37:40.214 --> 37:42.303
Oscar Woods's lawyer
convinced him

37:42.347 --> 37:44.000
to cut a deal
in exchange for testimony

37:44.044 --> 37:45.828
against Bowen
and his accomplices.

37:45.872 --> 37:48.701
And we're working to ID
their co-conspirators

37:48.744 --> 37:51.486
on the container ships
and at overseas ports.

37:51.530 --> 37:54.010
So you're trying to take down
the whole trafficking ring.

37:54.054 --> 37:57.057
Well, with INTERPOL's help,
I think we just might.

37:57.100 --> 37:59.102
And of course,

37:59.146 --> 38:01.757
Sebastian Nuzo's been officially
cleared of any suspicion.

38:01.801 --> 38:03.324
His good name is safe.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.065
And so are
his family's benefits.

38:05.108 --> 38:07.197
Thanks for your
help, Gordie.

38:08.764 --> 38:10.331
I know I don't make it easy.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.464
You never do.

seeing you all...

39:04.385 --> 39:06.561
just hurt.

39:06.605 --> 39:09.608
Brought back too many
memories of Sebastian.

39:09.651 --> 39:12.219
But when I saw you yesterday,

40:02.835 --> 40:04.532
Hey?

40:04.576 --> 40:06.534
You remember when we were
on leave near Ramstein

40:06.578 --> 40:09.058
and you were
dead set on finding

40:09.102 --> 40:11.365
the oldest bar
in Luxembourg?

40:11.409 --> 40:12.932
Yeah...

40:12.975 --> 40:14.455
Oh, God, here we go.

40:14.499 --> 40:16.414
We were walking
all over the city passing

40:16.457 --> 40:18.285
all these perfectly good bars
on the way.

40:18.328 --> 40:21.027
And then when we find
Magnum's special place...

40:21.070 --> 40:22.768
It had burned to the ground
two months before.

40:22.811 --> 40:24.117
Oh, man, we sat on the curb,

40:24.160 --> 40:25.466
drinking straight from a bottle

40:25.510 --> 40:27.990
of, uh, what was that stuff?

40:28.034 --> 40:30.732
Cassero-- black currant liqueur.

40:30.776 --> 40:32.604
Tasted like rancid grape juice.

40:32.647 --> 40:34.867
Weirdest hangover I've ever had.

40:34.910 --> 40:37.435
Oh, man.

40:37.478 --> 40:39.349
Yeah.

40:39.393 --> 40:42.091
What are you still doing here?

40:42.135 --> 40:45.617
Brother... I'm always here.

40:45.660 --> 40:48.358
That's why this
was so hard.

40:48.402 --> 40:50.709
You know, they say we die twice.

40:50.752 --> 40:53.799
Once when the breath
leaves us...

40:53.842 --> 40:56.845
and again once the last person
we know says our name.

40:56.889 --> 40:59.544
But when they were saying
my name in connection with this?

40:59.587 --> 41:01.850
It threatened
your memories of me.

41:01.894 --> 41:04.505
It made you afraid you
didn't know who I really was.

41:04.549 --> 41:06.507
No, no, I knew you.

41:08.030 --> 41:10.685
And I'll never forget you.

41:10.729 --> 41:13.166
It's not your fault.

41:13.209 --> 41:14.994
What happened to me.

41:15.037 --> 41:16.735
Me dying.

41:16.778 --> 41:18.519
There was nothing

41:18.563 --> 41:20.173
you could have
done that day.

41:20.216 --> 41:21.609
Yeah, I know.

41:21.653 --> 41:23.655
No, you know here.

41:23.698 --> 41:25.004
Not here.

41:25.047 --> 41:26.701
Not yet.

41:28.007 --> 41:30.139
It's not that
I couldn't save your life.

41:31.706 --> 41:34.274
It's that I still have mine.

41:34.317 --> 41:36.668
You know, all these...

41:36.711 --> 41:39.409
moments that I get...

41:39.453 --> 41:41.586
that you don't.

41:48.244 --> 41:50.551
It's not fair.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.901
Life's not fair.

41:54.860 --> 41:56.339
Neither is death.

41:58.124 --> 42:00.387
So...

42:00.430 --> 42:02.563
survivor's guilt?

42:02.607 --> 42:05.000
Is that why you're not living?

42:06.001 --> 42:07.394
What do you mean?

42:07.437 --> 42:09.396
You know what I mean.

42:09.439 --> 42:11.964
Since I died,
everybody else has been living.

42:12.007 --> 42:14.706
Rick's got a baby on the way.
TC's fostering a kid.

42:14.749 --> 42:16.403
And as far as Higgins goes,

42:16.446 --> 42:18.710
well, let's just say
the ice has thawed.

42:18.753 --> 42:21.408
Yeah, it has.

42:23.192 --> 42:25.412
A lot has changed.

42:25.455 --> 42:28.589
But you're still the same.

42:28.633 --> 42:30.765
And here you are,

42:30.809 --> 42:32.593
with a chance
to be happier

42:32.637 --> 42:35.596
than you've ever been,
and you won't take it.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.990
Every day is
a gift, Magnum.

42:39.382 --> 42:41.907
Don't let it slip
through your fingers.

42:43.996 --> 42:45.998
All you have to do

42:46.041 --> 42:48.000
is go over there...

42:48.043 --> 42:49.567
and tell her how you feel.
