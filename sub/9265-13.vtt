10:24.332 --> 10:26.126
WELL,
IT'S A BIT DESPERATE.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.710
WELL, YOU ARE DESPERATE.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.764
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, ERIC?

10:39.806 --> 10:42.767
BUDDY GARRITY AND I WENT OVER
TO SHANE DUBUQUE'S YESTERDAY.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.602
THAT KID'S AN ANIMAL.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.770
LIKE A WATER?

10:45.812 --> 10:46.771
NO.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.314
AS I UNDERSTAND IT,

10:48.356 --> 10:51.067
YOU AND WADE
WERE OVER THERE LAST WEEK.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.778
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.321
YEAH, WELL YOU MIGHT
BE ABLE TO IMAGINE

10:55.363 --> 10:57.782
HOW THAT MAKES ME FEEL.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.742
HEY, IF WE LOST SHANE DUBUQUE
TO ARNETT MEAD,

10:59.826 --> 11:01.244
WE'D BE DEAD NEXT YEAR.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.163
SO I FIGURED WE NEED HIM,
LET'S GO GET HIM.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.331
HEY, JOE, I DON'T WANT
YOU AND WADE RUNNING AROUND

11:05.373 --> 11:06.833
MAKING HOUSE CALLS,

11:06.875 --> 11:07.917
ACTING LIKE YOU
REPRESENT THIS TEAM.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.128
WELL, I DIDN'T SEE YOU
MOVING AGGRESSIVELY ON HIM,

11:10.170 --> 11:11.337
AND I DID NOT WANT
TO MISS THAT OPPORTUNITY‐‐

11:11.379 --> 11:13.673
JOE, YOU DO NOT REPRESENT
THIS TEAM.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.258
I BACKED UP
A TRUCKLOAD OF CASH

11:15.341 --> 11:17.302
FOR THIS TEAM
THIS YEAR.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.179
WITHOUT MY SON,
THERE IS NO TEAM.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.180
SO AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED,

11:21.139 --> 11:22.807
I REPRESENT THIS TEAM
AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE

11:22.849 --> 11:25.810
IN THIS TOWN.
ARE YOU TRYING
TO REPLACE ME?

11:30.315 --> 11:33.693
IF YOU WOULD LIKE
TO CONTINUE,

11:33.735 --> 11:35.153
I NEED YOUR
GUARANTEE THAT‐‐

11:35.195 --> 11:36.696
BARRING INJURY,
OF COURSE‐‐

11:36.738 --> 11:40.325
MY SON STARTS
EVERY GAME NEXT SEASON.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.202
I ALSO NEED
YOUR GUARANTEE

11:42.243 --> 11:43.828
THAT WADE AIKMAN
CALLS ALL THE PLAYS‐‐

11:43.870 --> 11:45.205
MAC CALLS MY PLAYS.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.749
YEAH, I KNOW.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.376
JOE, I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU GOT.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.879
AND I DON'T CARE
HOW WELL YOU THINK

11:52.921 --> 11:54.714
THAT BOY OF YOURS
CAN THROW A FOOTBALL.

11:54.756 --> 11:57.842
BUT YOU'RE NOT JUST MESSING
WITH MY LIVELIHOOD.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.219
NOW, YOU ARE
THREATENING MY FAMILY.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.304
I'M NOT THREATENING
ANYBODY.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.181
AGAINST
MY BETTER JUDGMENT,

12:03.223 --> 12:04.724
I'M OFFERING YOU
AN OPPORTUNITY

12:04.766 --> 12:06.309
TO CONTINUE
WITH THIS TEAM.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.856
WELL, I'M SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU CAN DO

12:11.898 --> 12:13.441
WITH THAT OPPORTUNITY.

12:26.913 --> 12:27.995
I'M PUSHING DOWN ON THE BROOM.

12:27.995 --> 12:29.195
BUT YOU'RE
NOT PUSHING HARD ENOUGH.

12:29.195 --> 12:30.959
IF YOU PUSH SO FAST,
IT WON'T PICK UP THE DIRT.
STOP.

12:30.959 --> 12:33.211
[laughing]
HI, GUYS.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.380

BEING ON THE LIST,

13:52.540 --> 13:54.625
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU

13:54.709 --> 13:58.296
THAT GOING TO UT
HAS BEEN A DREAM OF MINE

13:58.337 --> 14:00.631
PRETTY MUCH MY ENTIRE LIFE.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.636

14:05.678 --> 14:07.597
UM...YEAH.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.433
UH, MS. COLLETTE,

WE GET OVER 35,000
APPLICATIONS EACH YEAR,

14:13.686 --> 14:17.315
AND WE PUT ABOUT A THOUSAND
ON THE WAITLIST.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.026

UNFORTUNATELY, YEAH.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.950
THAT'S JUST‐‐THAT'S THE WAY
THE SYSTEM WORKS.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.630
ERIC, YOU NEED TO COME
TO THAT MEETING ON SATURDAY.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.507
WHY?
WELL...

14:42.548 --> 14:43.674

14:43.716 --> 14:45.384
THERE'S NOTHING
I COULD, SHOULD,

14:45.426 --> 14:47.011
OR NEED TO SAY
AT THAT MEETING.

14:47.053 --> 14:47.970
THEY CAN LOOK AT WHAT I'VE DONE
AND DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES

14:48.888 --> 14:50.723
IF THEY WANT JOE MCCOY
TO TAKE OVER THIS TEAM.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.475
IT'S THEIR DAMN FUNERAL.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.352
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD STRATEGY.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.562
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S NOT A STRATEGY, HON.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.356
I KNOW.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.649
BUT I'M STARTING TO THINK

14:59.732 --> 15:01.567
THAT WE'RE GOING
TO NEED A STRATEGY.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.653
I CAN'T OUTTALK,
NOR OUTSPEND‐‐

15:03.736 --> 15:05.363

BUT IF YOU DON'T
FIGHT FOR THIS,

15:21.754 --> 15:23.673
I THINK WE'RE
GOING TO REGRET IT.
