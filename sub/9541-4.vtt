00:05.228 --> 00:06.396
That's the last net.

00:06.425 --> 00:07.826
Can we go home now, Dylan?

00:07.894 --> 00:09.027
Come on, Brenda.

00:09.095 --> 00:10.362
I promised
the Trickell's Triquid people

00:10.429 --> 00:16.968
we'd do a good job
setting up for the tournament.

00:17.036 --> 00:20.772
I can't wait for a time when
robots do everything for us.

00:20.840 --> 00:25.410
Here. I brought some water.

00:25.478 --> 00:27.946
I want Trickell's Triquid.

00:28.014 --> 00:29.848
Trickell's Triquid is water.

00:29.916 --> 00:31.750
Um, no.

00:31.817 --> 00:36.588
It's 100% diet moisture.

00:36.656 --> 00:38.623
Man, you are
in a crabby mood.

00:38.691 --> 00:40.225
Please.
You wanna see crabby,

00:40.293 --> 00:41.560
I'll show you--

00:41.627 --> 00:44.429
Man crab!

00:45.531 --> 00:47.365
Ha ha ha ha!
Bren, where's you get that,

00:47.433 --> 00:49.734
the giant fake
crab parts emporium?

00:49.802 --> 00:51.236
Aah!

00:51.304 --> 00:53.305
Uhh! Uhh! It's real!

00:53.372 --> 00:54.539
Help me!

00:54.607 --> 00:55.674
Aah!

00:55.741 --> 00:56.741
Ah, nice try.

00:56.809 --> 00:59.344
What'd you do,
dig a big hole under the sand?

01:03.950 --> 01:05.617
You got an air tank under there?

01:07.687 --> 01:09.187
Brenda?

01:09.255 --> 01:10.989
Come on. Stop jokin'.

01:11.057 --> 01:12.057
Bren?

01:13.326 --> 01:16.962
Aah!

Hey, this is
k-ghoul's angel dynamite,

02:01.707 --> 02:03.541
sponsored
by Trickell's Triquid,

02:03.609 --> 02:07.078
what mother nature drinks
when she doesn't wanna look fat.

02:08.014 --> 02:09.814
Oh, boy. Like, what a crowd.

02:09.882 --> 02:12.350
I hope they saved us
some food, scoob.

02:12.418 --> 02:14.352
Yeah.
Trickell's Triquid.

02:14.420 --> 02:16.521
Trickell's Triquid here.

02:16.589 --> 02:21.326
The nonfat liquid diet
no-calorie gluten-free
moisture supplement,

02:21.394 --> 02:23.161
now in wet and extra-wet.

02:23.229 --> 02:26.464
Blah. Like, we want some
real food, right, scooby-doo?

02:26.532 --> 02:29.000
Uh-huh, like that.

02:31.404 --> 02:32.837
Ugh. Not that place.

02:32.905 --> 02:34.506
That guy's a freak.

02:34.573 --> 02:36.675
No. Like, he's totally cool.

02:36.742 --> 02:39.477
Just don't mention his nose.

02:39.545 --> 02:40.979
Hey there, cappy.

02:41.047 --> 02:43.148
What happened
to the old sniffer?

02:43.215 --> 02:44.416
What happened?!

02:44.483 --> 02:45.717
I'll tell ye, boyo.

02:45.785 --> 02:48.253
That was a clam that took it.

02:48.321 --> 02:49.954
Fierce and mighty was he,

02:50.022 --> 02:53.024
and reduced me to wearin'
facial underwear, he did.

02:53.092 --> 02:54.693
But I'll find him,

02:54.760 --> 02:57.128
and I won't stop shucking
till I do.

02:57.196 --> 02:58.797
Understand?

02:59.865 --> 03:01.966
Yes, sir,
Captain admiral, sir.

03:02.034 --> 03:08.306
It's skipper,
skipper Shelton,

03:08.374 --> 03:10.775
so, what'll it be,
skinny shanks?

03:10.843 --> 03:12.911
I'll take an extra large,
please.

03:14.013 --> 03:15.347
Didn't we agree

03:15.414 --> 03:17.682
that you would cut out
the junk food?

03:17.750 --> 03:21.386
I should, like, totally
eat something healthier.

03:21.454 --> 03:23.621
But--but--but--huh?

03:23.689 --> 03:25.457
What about you, wolfie?

03:25.524 --> 03:29.194
Is it a cone stuffed
with the fruits of the sea,

03:29.261 --> 03:31.463
or are ye afraid?

03:31.530 --> 03:32.897
Aye, aye, skipper.

03:32.965 --> 03:36.368
No fear. 2 cones here.

03:39.238 --> 03:40.438
Mmm. Those look good.

03:40.506 --> 03:44.743
A big salty clam
would sure go great
with this heat.

03:44.810 --> 03:47.879
No! Fred,
you know what happens

03:47.947 --> 03:50.115
you remember
my sister's wedding.

03:53.652 --> 03:57.655
I was so swollen

03:57.723 --> 03:59.124
hey, don't worry, daph.

03:59.191 --> 04:02.193
Those clams aren't close enough
to cause you any trouble.

04:02.261 --> 04:05.029
Hey, skipper, didn't your cabin
used to be over there,

04:05.097 --> 04:06.765
where the volleyball courts are?

04:06.832 --> 04:10.502
Aye! Every time the town
has an event on the beach,

04:10.569 --> 04:12.270
they move me business.

04:12.338 --> 04:15.840
Blast ye, city council! Arrh!

04:15.908 --> 04:16.641
Ehh!

04:16.709 --> 04:18.510
I need a clammin' break.

04:18.577 --> 04:20.211
Watch me cabin.

04:21.447 --> 04:24.516
Come on. Let's get our seats
for the first match.

04:29.455 --> 04:30.822
Aw, come on, velma.

04:30.890 --> 04:32.590
Can't I even look?

04:32.658 --> 04:34.025
Wait for me.

04:55.448 --> 04:56.915
Hmm.

04:56.982 --> 04:58.516
Great game, huh?

04:58.584 --> 05:00.185
Yeah, great.

05:00.252 --> 05:02.954
You know, we're still
close to the water.

05:03.022 --> 05:04.856
All kinds of fish in there.

05:04.924 --> 05:07.592
Yep. They're so beautiful.

05:07.660 --> 05:08.793
The girls?!

05:08.861 --> 05:11.095
No. Th-the nets.

05:11.163 --> 05:12.130
Nets?

05:12.198 --> 05:17.969
I wonder what
their tensile strength is.

05:19.572 --> 05:21.172
Feel like going for a walk?

05:21.240 --> 05:23.641
No one here's
going to miss us.

05:24.877 --> 05:27.245
Scooby-doo,
is that your stomach?

05:27.313 --> 05:29.147
Uh-uh, not my stomach.

05:41.494 --> 05:44.362
Is that a cr,
or is it a man?

05:44.430 --> 05:46.564
Like, it's a--a mab.

05:46.632 --> 05:48.566
Um, a--a cran.

05:48.634 --> 05:51.503
I-it's a man crab.

06:21.700 --> 06:22.967
Hyah!

06:59.138 --> 07:01.439
We can't let that thing
get away.

07:01.507 --> 07:02.607
Sure we can, fred.

07:02.675 --> 07:05.376
All we have to do
is stand right here.

07:05.444 --> 07:06.878
Yeah, stand right here.

07:06.946 --> 07:08.279
Yikes!
Yikes!

07:12.217 --> 07:14.485
Huh?

07:14.553 --> 07:15.587
What?

07:15.654 --> 07:17.922
They're gone?

07:21.364 --> 07:23.565
And then it kind of went,
like, errh.

07:23.633 --> 07:26.969
And then yeesh and then--

07:27.043 --> 07:29.978
and weird eyes, like this.

07:31.381 --> 07:33.916
Sheriff stone,
you have to close the beach.

07:33.983 --> 07:39.121
The beach stays open.

07:39.189 --> 07:44.993
You can't just
ignore a giant crustacean
attacking your tournament.

07:45.061 --> 07:47.796
Young lady,
no one's sure what they saw.

07:47.864 --> 07:49.765
Could have been a man crab.

07:49.833 --> 07:51.467
Could have been a man lobster.

07:51.534 --> 07:54.002
Could have also
been a really ugly,
out-of-shape person

07:54.070 --> 07:55.971
who should probably be drinking
Trickell's Triquid.

07:56.039 --> 07:59.842
Well, it's pretty clear to me
that somethin' did happen here,

07:59.909 --> 08:00.876
and, uh...

08:00.944 --> 08:03.312
There's nothin'
I can do about it.

08:03.379 --> 08:04.279
But, sheriff--

08:04.347 --> 08:05.848
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:05.915 --> 08:07.850
We're not set up for this.

08:07.917 --> 08:10.419
Our motto is
to serve and protect,

08:10.487 --> 08:14.890
not to serve and protect
from man crabs.

08:16.326 --> 08:19.027
Well, you know
what this means, don't you?

08:19.095 --> 08:20.095
We respect authority,

08:20.163 --> 08:22.664
go back home, and forget
this ever happened.

08:22.732 --> 08:24.767
It means we investigate.

08:24.834 --> 08:27.136
I was afraid you'd say that.
Hoo hoo.

08:27.203 --> 08:29.738
I think our investigation's
off to a good start.

08:29.806 --> 08:31.540
A locker spilling sand?

08:31.608 --> 08:33.075
But look whose it is.

08:33.143 --> 08:35.043
Skipper Shelton.

08:35.111 --> 08:38.780
And who wasn't around
when the man crab
grabbed that girl?

08:38.847 --> 08:41.549
He's so angry at the city
for moving his cabin,

08:41.618 --> 08:44.019
he has a perfect motive
for ruining the tournament.

08:44.087 --> 08:48.056
What we need is a trap
for the man crab, right, fred?

08:48.124 --> 08:50.058
Actually, what I was
thinking is...

08:50.126 --> 08:52.961
We need a trap
for the man crab.

08:53.029 --> 08:53.962
Humph. Good plan.

08:54.030 --> 08:55.364
Thanks!

08:55.431 --> 08:57.199
Daphne, you used to play
a little volleyball

08:57.267 --> 08:58.634
back in the day, didn't you?

08:58.701 --> 09:01.503
Well, I wouldn't exactly
say, "play."

09:01.571 --> 09:02.871
Oof!

09:02.872 --> 09:03.872
Ahh!

09:03.940 --> 09:04.973
Ahh!
Oof!

09:05.041 --> 09:06.809
You'll be perfect bait.

09:06.876 --> 09:09.211
I mean, what man crab
wouldn't want

09:09.279 --> 09:13.682
to drag you beneath the sand?

09:13.750 --> 09:14.983
Sort of.

09:16.085 --> 09:18.053
You know, scoob,
before all this started,

09:18.121 --> 09:20.322
I really loved crab.

09:20.390 --> 09:21.957
Crab brÃ»lÃ©e.

09:22.025 --> 09:24.860
Crabaroni and cheese.

09:24.928 --> 09:25.861
Hoo hoo hoo.

09:25.929 --> 09:27.563
Crabsicles.

09:27.630 --> 09:29.231
I can't talk about this.

09:29.299 --> 09:32.501
I promised velma.

09:32.569 --> 09:35.470
I promised myself that I
would eat more healthy.

09:35.538 --> 09:37.873
Lookout time's over, guys.

09:37.941 --> 09:39.641
Come see what I made.

09:43.379 --> 09:45.080
Here's the plan.

09:45.148 --> 09:47.149
Daphne will run
across the sand to here,

09:47.217 --> 09:49.618
where the man crab
will step on this plunger,

09:49.686 --> 09:53.822
and when he does, a big lid
will spring up under him
and dump him into that pot.

09:53.890 --> 09:56.191
Like, where's Daphne, anyways?
The match is about to start,

09:56.259 --> 09:59.928
and scoob and I have to get back
to keeping an eye
on the clam cones.

10:01.231 --> 10:02.497
I mean the skipper.

10:02.565 --> 10:06.635
I'll go get her.

10:10.707 --> 10:13.408
Wow. Who are you
trying to impress?

10:13.476 --> 10:16.411
Eh, what? This old thing?

10:16.479 --> 10:18.447
I just wanna do a good job.

10:18.514 --> 10:20.449
Would you rub oil on my back?

10:20.516 --> 10:23.919
Fred likes shiny things,
and I'm tired of him
looking at nets.

10:23.987 --> 10:26.355
Hey, Daphne,
let me ask you something.

10:26.422 --> 10:28.557
If you liked a boy--

10:28.625 --> 10:30.759
Who told you?
Was it one of my sisters?

10:30.827 --> 10:32.394
Dawn. Heh. She thinks
she's so perfect.

10:32.462 --> 10:35.264
Well, what no one knows
is she has a sixth toe on her--

10:35.331 --> 10:37.599
uh, what are you
talking about?

10:37.667 --> 10:43.171
I--clearly not
what you were talking about.

10:43.239 --> 10:46.174
Do boys like it
when you tell them what to do?

10:46.242 --> 10:48.510
Heh. Of course they do.
Without my mom around,

10:48.578 --> 10:50.679
I don't even think
my dad could feed himself.

10:50.747 --> 10:53.548
I remember she went away once,
and when she came back,

10:53.616 --> 10:57.219
we found my dad half-naked
and sucking on an unopened
can of soup.

10:57.287 --> 10:58.186
Why?

10:58.254 --> 11:01.757
Well...

11:01.824 --> 11:04.426
That's all. Uhh!

11:04.494 --> 11:09.665
Make sure you get me
between the shoulder blades, ok?

11:09.732 --> 11:12.167
Hey. That's a little
much, don't you thi--

11:12.235 --> 11:17.940
Aah!

11:18.007 --> 11:20.442
But, man, do those clams
smell good.

11:20.510 --> 11:23.512
Go for it.
I won't tell velma.

11:23.579 --> 11:28.550
Oh. Well, I guess
one delicious, chewy,
briny, doughy treat

11:28.618 --> 11:31.720
can't hurt that much.
Ho ho ho.

11:33.690 --> 11:35.424
Huh?

11:35.491 --> 11:36.692
Eee!

11:50.840 --> 11:52.274
Like, help.

11:52.342 --> 11:53.709
Aah! Aah!

11:53.776 --> 11:54.977
Daphne!

11:55.044 --> 11:57.546
Fred! Fred!

11:57.613 --> 11:59.281
Daphne! Daphne!

11:59.349 --> 12:00.816
What happened?

12:00.883 --> 12:06.321
Something that smelled
like drawn butter
threw me in the van.

12:06.389 --> 12:11.626
He took Daphne.

12:12.962 --> 12:14.096
We have to, velma.

12:14.163 --> 12:15.931
I don't know what to do,

12:15.999 --> 12:17.733
a-and she was so shiny.

12:25.575 --> 12:28.210
He's been digging like that
since we lost Daphne.

12:28.277 --> 12:32.280
There's nothing but torn
carpet all over the back
of the mystery machine.

12:32.348 --> 12:34.016
Like, this is all my fault.

12:34.083 --> 12:35.917
If I never tried
to be healthy,

12:35.985 --> 12:38.220
Daphne would be all right.

12:38.287 --> 12:40.789
Scooby-doo, more.

12:47.230 --> 12:49.031
Someone needs to make a plan.

12:49.098 --> 12:52.067
Why isn't anyone
making a plan?

12:52.135 --> 12:53.702
That's usually you, fred.

12:53.770 --> 12:56.905
You're right.
What's wrong with me?

12:58.274 --> 13:01.343
Uh, I'll get it.

13:03.913 --> 13:04.813
Huh?

13:04.881 --> 13:06.014
Uh--yii!

13:06.082 --> 13:08.016
Mr. e.

13:13.856 --> 13:16.124
Jinkies. Get a load of this.

13:16.192 --> 13:18.093
This article's from years ago.

13:18.161 --> 13:22.831
It says 4 kids disappeared exploring
the Crystal Cove caverns.

13:22.899 --> 13:24.099
Let me see that.

13:24.167 --> 13:25.233
Is something wrong, angel?

13:25.301 --> 13:26.701
Do you know them?

13:26.769 --> 13:28.036
No.

13:28.104 --> 13:35.177
Sorry. It's nothing.

13:41.084 --> 13:42.484
It's not working.

13:42.552 --> 13:44.252
It's an 8-track, Freddie.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.921
Old school, baby.

13:47.490 --> 13:49.758
Hello, children.

13:49.826 --> 13:51.526
If you've read the article,

13:51.594 --> 13:54.930
you know this volleyball
tournament isn't the first time

13:54.997 --> 13:57.766
kids have disappeared
from Crystal Cove.

13:57.834 --> 14:01.236
Worth researching,
don't you think?

14:10.984 --> 14:12.152
Welcome to where
the library keeps

14:12.220 --> 14:14.588
its old newspaper articles.
They call it the morgue.

14:14.656 --> 14:17.591
The morgue? Like, why do
they have to call it that?
Hoo hoo.

14:17.659 --> 14:21.395
Yeah. They're old articles,
not dead.

14:41.983 --> 14:43.383
There's a book over here.

14:43.451 --> 14:45.052
Daphne read a book once.

14:45.119 --> 14:48.055
And this chair.
Daphne liked to sit in chairs.

14:48.122 --> 14:49.823
That card catalog over there--

14:49.891 --> 14:50.757
not helping, fred.

14:50.825 --> 14:53.393
I know.
What's the matter with me?

14:53.461 --> 14:59.433
Hmm. Here's a piece
on the founding of
Trickell's Triquid,

14:59.500 --> 15:00.834
the year
those kids vanished.

15:00.902 --> 15:01.968
Listen to this.

15:02.036 --> 15:03.603
Skipper threatened
the whole town.

15:03.671 --> 15:07.441
He swore he'd take
drastic action.

15:07.508 --> 15:11.044
Hey, is this the rest
of that article
that Mr. e sent us?

15:11.112 --> 15:12.512
Yeah, and check this out.

15:12.580 --> 15:15.449
It says the Crystal Cove caverns
run under the beach

15:15.516 --> 15:17.417
where the volleyball tournament
is being played.

15:17.485 --> 15:21.621
Like, I know
that look, and it's
never good. Hoo hoo.

15:26.227 --> 15:34.968
Yah!

15:41.809 --> 15:43.043
Whew.

15:43.111 --> 15:44.711
Huh?

15:47.315 --> 15:50.083
Like, guys,
I think I found something.

15:55.890 --> 15:58.091
To climb up into
the volleyball tournament?

15:58.159 --> 16:01.461
One that's very industrious
and has a degree in engineering.

16:01.529 --> 16:04.131
The answer is
"no crab monster."

16:04.198 --> 16:07.401
I don't care who did it.
I just want Daphne back.

16:07.468 --> 16:10.937
Fred, is that you?

16:11.005 --> 16:13.573
And her voice sounds
as sweet and as perfect

16:13.641 --> 16:16.009
as a trap snapping shut
on a criminal.

16:16.077 --> 16:18.378
Did I say that out loud?

16:18.446 --> 16:19.679
Come on!

16:20.648 --> 16:22.516
Help!

16:23.618 --> 16:26.887
Daphne!

16:26.954 --> 16:27.854
Thank goodness.

16:27.922 --> 16:29.556
I'm so glad you're--

16:29.624 --> 16:32.159
hey, this is a nice cage.

16:39.167 --> 16:41.168
Let's get back
to the surface before--aah!

16:56.617 --> 16:58.251
Run.

16:59.187 --> 17:00.120
Yaah!

17:24.512 --> 17:26.445
Where is everybody?

17:26.513 --> 17:29.649
Like, maybe they got eaten
by a man crab.

17:38.159 --> 17:42.028
Scooby-doo,
do you smell what I smell?

17:48.269 --> 17:50.937
That's the way out of here,
scooby-doo.

18:13.794 --> 18:15.629
Run, scoob!

18:20.134 --> 18:23.003
We'll go out the way
we came in.

18:26.507 --> 18:27.641
Ehh! Push!

18:27.708 --> 18:31.177
Give me all your paw.

18:31.245 --> 18:33.280
!

18:40.988 --> 18:42.923
Waah!

18:53.100 --> 18:55.135
Yikes!

19:05.413 --> 19:08.715
Yee-heh-hoo-hoo!

19:08.783 --> 19:10.750
Hee hee hee hee!

19:10.818 --> 19:12.953
Like, we got him.

19:13.020 --> 19:14.721
But how did you find
your way out?

19:14.789 --> 19:16.990
Clam cones.

19:17.058 --> 19:20.660
You were saved by junk food?

19:20.728 --> 19:23.763
Junk food and me have
a very special relationship.

19:23.831 --> 19:26.032
Maybe I should ask it
for advice.

19:26.100 --> 19:27.601
Speaking of clam cones,

19:27.668 --> 19:30.203
I see skipper Shelton
isn't around again.

19:30.271 --> 19:31.871
Or are you, skipper?

19:31.939 --> 19:35.008
Ah, back from the laundromat,
I am,

19:35.076 --> 19:39.846
and once more
does me nose hammock smell
fresh as the mornin' tide.

19:39.914 --> 19:43.149
Wait. If you're
not the man crab, then who--

19:43.217 --> 19:46.386
everyone, meet bud Shelton.

19:46.454 --> 19:47.320
Who?
Who?

19:47.388 --> 19:49.656
The Trickell's Triquid mascot.

19:49.724 --> 19:52.592
And the inventor,
not that dirtball trickell.

19:52.660 --> 19:54.294
Like, how did you know, velma?

19:54.362 --> 19:58.398
I knew it wasn't a real crab,

19:58.466 --> 20:00.567
plus when I saw
the mole pattern

20:00.635 --> 20:03.570
on the cheek of the man
next to trickell
in the newspaper,

20:03.638 --> 20:06.373
I rememered the same pattern
on the mascot.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.408
He took the credit
for my creation.

20:08.476 --> 20:10.944
It was supposed to be called
bud's bloosh.

20:11.012 --> 20:13.580
I was still working
on the name.

20:13.648 --> 20:16.683
I spent countless hours
making the man-crab costume

20:16.751 --> 20:19.352
and even more time building
my system of trapdoors

20:19.420 --> 20:21.154
and the stairs
under the beach.

20:21.222 --> 20:23.523
And in case anyone came
snooping in between kidnappings,

20:23.591 --> 20:26.426
I hid my costume in a locker
big enough to hold it,

20:26.494 --> 20:29.963
putting a label with
skipper's name on it
over the real label

20:30.031 --> 20:32.666
so if anyone found it,
they'd blame him.

20:32.733 --> 20:35.602
All that work just to get back
at Mr. trickell?

20:35.670 --> 20:40.173
Wouldn't it have been easier
and more legal to Sue him?

20:40.241 --> 20:42.275
Lawyers take forever.

20:42.343 --> 20:44.044
I would have succeeded, too,

20:44.111 --> 20:46.346
if it weren't
for you meddling brats

20:46.414 --> 20:48.048
probing into my
crustacean-themed
revenge scheme.

20:48.115 --> 20:52.419
Well, almost doesn't
shuck the clam,

20:57.158 --> 21:00.627
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

21:06.934 --> 21:11.137
So, fred, velma said you
were kind of out of sorts
when I got kidnapped.

21:11.205 --> 21:13.173
Yeah, that. Well...

21:13.240 --> 21:15.008
I think it's sweet.

21:15.076 --> 21:17.410
Really? Oh, that's so great.

21:17.478 --> 21:19.846
I was afraid it might
mess up our friendship.

21:19.914 --> 21:22.182
Don't worry. I will never
have feelings again.

21:22.249 --> 21:23.683
Hmm. We'll see.

21:23.751 --> 21:27.187
So, velma, did I
miss anything else
while I was gone?

21:27.254 --> 21:28.221
Actually, yeah.

21:29.790 --> 21:33.493
What--like, what is it, daph?

21:33.561 --> 21:37.263
The one with the picture
of boy and girl inside,

21:37.331 --> 21:39.666
jinkies. I guess we've got

21:39.734 --> 21:41.835
a new mystery on our hands.
