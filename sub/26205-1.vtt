00:34.535 --> 00:35.803
Okay.

00:41.242 --> 00:41.509
Jan!

00:47.548 --> 00:49.750
I'm gonna
need a hand here.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.452
I can't
do this, Cam.

00:52.453 --> 00:53.154
You what?

00:54.355 --> 00:59.827
Hey, you're a part
of this too.

00:59.860 --> 01:00.494
Now, come on.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.722
Oh... Damn.

01:35.163 --> 01:35.563
Come on,
move it.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.568
Shovel?

01:46.507 --> 01:49.677
Keep an eye out.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.579
This is gonna take a while.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.562
You can quit
worrying now.

02:08.596 --> 02:11.232
It's done.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.501
Okay?

02:13.534 --> 02:15.869
I don't--
I don't understand, Cam.

02:15.903 --> 02:19.440
Oh, come on.
It was an accident.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.643
What else was
I gonna do, huh?

02:22.676 --> 02:26.347
I told her not to scream.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.148
You heard me, right?

02:31.719 --> 02:32.786
Right?

04:06.380 --> 04:06.847
Hey,
where you headed?

04:06.880 --> 04:08.682
Westwood.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.551
Sure, no problem.
We're, uh, heading that way.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.486
Really?

04:12.520 --> 04:12.920
Uh-huh.
Hop in.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.555
Thanks.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.334
So, you come far?

04:26.367 --> 04:27.835
Eugene.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.637
Oregon?

04:29.670 --> 04:30.704
Did you hitch
the whole way?

04:30.738 --> 04:32.373
Uh-huh.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.442
Wow, good for you.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.809
So what's
your name?

04:35.843 --> 04:36.877
Colleen.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.312
Colleen...

04:38.346 --> 04:41.482
Nice.
Hi, Colleen.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.050
What about
you guys?

04:43.083 --> 04:45.719
We're just out
for a drive.

04:45.753 --> 04:46.620
What brings you
to Westwood?

04:46.654 --> 04:48.589
Oh, it's
my friend's birthday,

04:48.622 --> 04:49.957
her 21st.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.759
And what time
is she expecting you?

04:51.792 --> 04:54.094
She isn't.
It's a surprise.

04:54.127 --> 04:57.365
Well, you gotta
love surprises.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.792
Uh... apparently there's
some ice caves up ahead

05:58.826 --> 05:59.693
on the main highway.
We were thinking

05:59.727 --> 06:03.397
we might, uh, stop by
and check 'em out.

06:03.431 --> 06:04.798
Oh, where about
are they?

06:04.832 --> 06:07.435
Oh, they're
real close by.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.802
Okay, it's just
I was hoping

06:08.836 --> 06:09.703
to make it there
before dark.

06:09.737 --> 06:13.407
Don't worry,
we won't be long.

06:13.441 --> 06:16.076
You'll have
plenty of time.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.806
Where are the caves?

06:45.839 --> 06:49.109
We normally get out
and walk from here.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.745
I didn't realize
you had been before.

06:51.779 --> 06:56.450
I'll catch up with you.
I'm just gonna grab my camera.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.519
If I remember right,
they're just around the bend.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.457
Put your hands
above your head.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.993
You gonna do what I say?

07:06.026 --> 07:06.927
Mm-hm.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.698
Put your hands
above your head.

07:20.574 --> 07:21.609
Open.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.484
Put your head down.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.159
Hey, let's go.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.142
Want some fries?

07:59.079 --> 08:01.782
Be dark
in another hour.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.097
You gonna do
what I say?

08:17.130 --> 08:17.798
Uh-huh.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.672
Nice and easy...

08:24.705 --> 08:25.706
Follow my voice.

08:28.876 --> 08:29.877
Step up.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.780
Please, why
are you doing this?

08:33.813 --> 08:36.817
Please stop,
please stop, please.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.119
Shut up,
shut up.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.822
Just try to relax.
It'll be over quicker.

08:41.855 --> 08:46.560
No, no...
no...

08:46.594 --> 08:48.762
Stop, please stop!

08:52.966 --> 08:54.001
Okay!

09:20.027 --> 09:22.963
Get your head down.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.998
Go get the box.

09:30.771 --> 09:33.874
No, no, no...

09:33.907 --> 09:35.609
No, no!

09:42.783 --> 09:43.917
Why is this
happening to me?

09:43.951 --> 09:47.020
Please, why is
this happening to me?

09:47.054 --> 09:49.857
Why is this
happening to me?

09:55.996 --> 10:00.768
Look, we discussed
this already, okay?

10:00.801 --> 10:04.037
I don't know,
maybe a few days.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.339
And then what?

10:06.373 --> 10:09.309
Then we'll take her
a ways from here.

10:09.342 --> 10:12.913
Drop her off
near Mineral somewhere.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.282
What if she
goes to the police?

10:15.315 --> 10:17.885
She doesn't know who
we are or where she is.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.253
Besides, we've hardly
done anything.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.157
Where are you going?

10:24.191 --> 10:26.694
Same place I always go.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.229
When will you be back?

11:23.884 --> 11:26.286
What is it?
What do you want?

11:26.319 --> 11:26.887
I'm cold...

11:26.920 --> 11:29.990
I just want to go home.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.060
What would you do
if I let you go?

11:33.093 --> 11:35.195
Nothing, nothing!

11:35.228 --> 11:37.064
I promise I won't
say anything.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.099
I just want to
go home, please...

11:40.801 --> 11:42.269
Do you know where
you are?

11:42.302 --> 11:43.436
Somewhere
near Red Bluff.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.139
I won't tell anybody.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.141
Please, just...
I want to go home.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.011
Please!

12:02.089 --> 12:05.058
* So in love with you *

12:05.092 --> 12:08.495
* Tell me baby *

12:08.528 --> 12:11.899
* That you love me too *

12:14.935 --> 12:18.038
* Couldn't make it
through the day *

12:18.071 --> 12:19.973
* If you go away *

12:20.007 --> 12:24.778
* I'm so in love with you *

12:24.812 --> 12:28.181
* Oh, yeah *

12:28.215 --> 12:33.086
* We'll make it one more day
Never go away *

12:33.120 --> 12:37.925
* I'm so in love with you *

12:50.537 --> 12:53.306
In a moment,
I'm gonna remove your gag.

12:53.340 --> 12:57.344
If you scream, I'll cut
your vocal chords.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.479
Understand?

13:21.434 --> 13:26.273
Why are you
doing this to me?

13:28.575 --> 13:30.110
Piss in this.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.851
I can't if you watch.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.120
Oh.
I'll turn my back.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.275
Here.
Eat this.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.549
I'm not hungry.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.020
I said eat it.

14:22.295 --> 14:26.033
Because I can.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.202
I'm doing this...
because I can.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.014
Tell me baby...

14:41.048 --> 14:46.086
That you love me too...

15:21.254 --> 15:23.090
I'm scared, Cam.

15:24.691 --> 15:27.227
Why?

15:27.260 --> 15:30.230
I went into the basement
while you were at work.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.101
What d'you do that for?

15:34.401 --> 15:37.370
She wouldn't quit moaning.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.243
I spoke to her, Cam.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.979
She's gonna talk
if we let her go.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.447
I know she will.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.017
She-- she'll go to
the police.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.421
Then we'll
have to keep her.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.593
What-- what
do you mean?

16:00.627 --> 16:02.629
Keep her where?

16:02.662 --> 16:04.531
In the basement.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.735
For how long?

16:08.768 --> 16:11.204
I dunno, I mean,
till, you know...

16:11.238 --> 16:12.405
Till we figure things out.

16:15.408 --> 16:18.645
That's not-- that's not
what we talked about, Cam.

16:18.678 --> 16:19.646
That wasn't--

16:19.679 --> 16:22.149
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't start that now.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.217
The situation changed, right?

16:26.353 --> 16:28.555
Look at me.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.060
Look at me.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.698
You knew when we
were married,

16:38.731 --> 16:41.234
you knew how it is.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.303
And you took a vow
before God.

16:43.336 --> 16:49.242
Love, honor and obey,
right?

16:49.276 --> 16:51.711
I mean, it's not like
I've changed.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.047
It's you.

16:54.081 --> 16:57.350
You're the one who says that
you can't take it anymore.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.386
I mean... what am I
supposed to do, huh?

16:59.419 --> 17:04.324
I'm sorry.
You scare me sometimes.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.527
Come here.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.431
Come on...
Come here.

17:15.568 --> 17:16.502
Don't say that.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.078
Look at it this way.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.414
You want to start
a family, right?

17:28.415 --> 17:30.783
Well, this could be
the perfect time.

17:30.817 --> 17:34.121
As long as she's here,
I won't have to hang you up.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.489
None of that stuff,
you see?

17:38.691 --> 17:40.727
You mean that?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.362
Sure.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.672
If she stays...

17:52.705 --> 17:56.276
Promise me you won't
have sex with her.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.546
Promise me, Cam.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.714
Just bondage, okay?

18:03.483 --> 18:06.586
Okay.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.586
Stand up.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.555
Step up.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.567
When can I go home?

19:01.608 --> 19:04.577
Let me out!

19:04.611 --> 19:06.579
Please!

19:21.861 --> 19:24.331
No, no...

19:24.364 --> 19:25.832
No, no, no...

19:28.935 --> 19:29.902
No, no, no,
I'm not here.

19:29.936 --> 19:33.706
I'm not here, I'm not here,
I'm not here...

19:46.986 --> 19:49.222
Whereabouts does
this new friend live?

19:49.256 --> 19:50.790
California.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.325
That it?

19:52.359 --> 19:55.395
Big place, California.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.597
Why don't I just
give you bus fare?

19:57.630 --> 19:58.631
Oh, no, Dad,
it's okay.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.367
Nope, no,
it's no problem.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.501
Dad, please.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.068
People hitch all the time
these days.

20:02.101 --> 20:04.504
It's fine, I promise.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.373
Alright, have it
your way.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.408
Hi, Colleen.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.247
Jump out
the window...

20:14.281 --> 20:17.016
Run and don't come back...

20:20.420 --> 20:21.888
You gonna
do what I say?

20:22.922 --> 20:26.926
Big place, California...

20:38.805 --> 20:41.641
Hello, America...

20:41.674 --> 20:44.377
Hello?
Yeah.

20:44.411 --> 20:45.912
Oh, hi.

20:47.947 --> 20:51.284
Uh...
Oh, hold on.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.387
Hey, it's Tim.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.589
He wants to know
if we've seen Colleen.

20:56.623 --> 20:57.857
Apparently her rent's due.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.292
She isn't there?

20:59.326 --> 21:00.493
No.

21:00.527 --> 21:04.564
When was the
last time you talked to her?

21:04.597 --> 21:07.900
Well, no, she didn't say
where she was headed, exactly.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.203
Age?

21:11.237 --> 21:12.872
Nineteen.

21:12.905 --> 21:15.808
She's twenty.
She's twenty.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.646
Twenty, right.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.950
So are you guys
gonna put out

21:23.983 --> 21:26.085
a search for her, or...?

21:26.118 --> 21:28.721
Legally, she's an adult.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.324
Unless there's evidence
a crime's been committed,

21:31.358 --> 21:33.960
she's free to do
whatever she wants.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.718
What you doing here?

21:58.751 --> 22:01.621
I-- I just left
the doctor's office...

22:01.654 --> 22:04.491
Oh, yeah?
You okay?

22:05.492 --> 22:06.926
Yeah.

22:06.959 --> 22:10.897
Cam, I'm--
I'm pregnant.

22:10.930 --> 22:11.864
Huh.

22:13.900 --> 22:17.604
Aren't you... happy?

22:17.637 --> 22:21.741
Yeah, sure.
Um...

22:21.774 --> 22:23.643
You think it's a boy?

22:23.676 --> 22:25.978
I don't know,
I guess it could be.

22:27.980 --> 22:31.484
Look, Cam, I--
I've been thinking.

22:31.518 --> 22:35.522
Um, I think it's time
we got rid of, you know...

22:35.555 --> 22:38.425
Hold on,
what do you mean?

22:38.458 --> 22:39.959
If there's gonna be
a kid in the house, I...

22:39.992 --> 22:44.163
Hey, hey, hey.
We have an agreement.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.965
We-- we agreed a little while.
It's been six months.

22:45.998 --> 22:49.636
Jan, we can't
get rid of her now.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.939
You only just got pregnant.

22:52.972 --> 22:56.876
What if she goes to
the police?

22:58.578 --> 23:00.880
You really wanna
risk all that?

23:02.749 --> 23:04.417
Well, what are
we gonna do?

23:16.095 --> 23:17.564
Hey, happy new year.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.699
Heh, thanks.
You too.

23:24.971 --> 23:27.907
You okay there?
Have an accident?

23:27.940 --> 23:30.643
Nah, she's fine.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.712
Arthritis,
she's had it a while,

23:32.745 --> 23:34.514
and we finally
got her fixed up.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.048
Oh, yeah?
Good for you.

23:37.984 --> 23:38.885
Listen, I need to come by
and get the furnace

23:38.918 --> 23:41.954
in your basement
serviced sometime soon.

23:41.988 --> 23:45.692
You wanna let me know
when's convenient?

23:45.725 --> 23:48.628
Sure.
No problem.

23:48.661 --> 23:49.629
Oh, and uh...

23:49.662 --> 23:51.130
If you could drop the rent by,
that'd be good.

23:52.932 --> 23:53.032
Yeah.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.711
You should
see the scar.

24:04.744 --> 24:07.446
Looks like someone went after
my knee with a hammer.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.605
Hey.

24:32.639 --> 24:35.508
Want you to
type this up.

24:35.542 --> 24:36.743
What's this?

24:36.776 --> 24:38.010
Not every box
needs a lock.

24:48.788 --> 24:51.691
Read this.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.527
What is it?

24:54.561 --> 24:57.764
Just read it.
Out loud.

24:57.797 --> 25:01.634
The new S&M rage
has created a demand

25:01.668 --> 25:05.605
beyond common prostitution,
and has given rise

25:05.638 --> 25:08.107
to a new,
more depraved trade.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.976
Even in the United States,

25:10.009 --> 25:12.912
an underground brotherhood
of slave traders

25:12.945 --> 25:14.313
as large as the Mafia

25:14.346 --> 25:17.116
not only controls the trade
in young flesh,

25:17.149 --> 25:20.319
but also the
hunting down

25:20.352 --> 25:21.053
and punishment
of runaways.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.057
Look at me.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.932
They know that
you're here.

25:34.166 --> 25:35.935
Who does?

25:35.968 --> 25:38.037
The Company.

25:38.070 --> 25:41.240
In the article.

25:41.273 --> 25:44.210
They found out
about you.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.613
I don't understand.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.682
Here's the thing.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.751
I've been with
the Company awhile now,

25:51.784 --> 25:55.087
and they provide security.

25:55.121 --> 25:57.890
So if a slave of mine
tries to escape,

25:57.924 --> 26:00.827
they track them down for me.

26:00.860 --> 26:04.831
And there's nothing they won't
do to catch a runaway slave.

26:05.832 --> 26:08.000
They'll even punish
their family.

26:20.079 --> 26:24.817
Colleen and Bonnie,
September 1976.

26:27.954 --> 26:30.122
She looks nice.

26:30.156 --> 26:32.124
I guess she lives
with your folks

26:32.158 --> 26:34.126
over on Glenforest Road?

26:37.063 --> 26:38.631
Look,
the point is,

26:38.665 --> 26:41.033
you don't wanna
mess with the Company.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.173
I bet you're wondering
what happened to her.

26:50.376 --> 26:52.411
She used to be a slave too,

26:52.444 --> 26:55.014
and her previous master
was a pretty brutal guy,

26:55.047 --> 26:56.916
so she tried to escape.

26:56.949 --> 26:57.984
The Company found her.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.186
They hung her up, twisted her
legs up really bad.

27:00.219 --> 27:04.056
They were gonna kill her,
until I came in,

27:04.090 --> 27:07.660
I took pity on her,
and I bought her.

27:07.694 --> 27:10.830
A few years later
I made her my wife.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.067
That's the third
operation she's had

27:15.101 --> 27:17.136
to try and fix her up.

27:20.072 --> 27:23.976
Anyways, now they
know I have you,

27:24.010 --> 27:25.712
I have to formally
register you.

27:25.745 --> 27:27.847
It's gonna cost me
fifteen hundred dollars.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.216
And if I don't do that,
they're gonna take you away.

27:32.384 --> 27:34.821
And I can't tell
what will happen to you

27:34.854 --> 27:37.023
if I let them do that.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.271
What is this?

27:52.304 --> 27:54.807
It's a
Company contract.

27:54.841 --> 27:58.244
It formalizes your
status as my slave.

28:00.780 --> 28:01.848
Look, I don't want
to rush you or anything,

28:01.881 --> 28:04.416
but there's a guy from
the Company upstairs right now,

28:04.450 --> 28:06.452
and I wouldn't
keep him waiting.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.729
What if I don't sign it?

28:18.998 --> 28:21.367
If you don't sign it,
I'll just sign it for you,

28:21.400 --> 28:26.138
but I will make you very sorry
that you didn't.

28:46.358 --> 28:49.261
You made a good choice.

29:00.139 --> 29:02.341
Put this on.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.084
Now you're
formally registered.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.086
You need to wear this.

29:14.120 --> 29:19.826
Your company identification
collar stays on at all times.

29:21.193 --> 29:23.362
Okay...

29:23.395 --> 29:25.397
Let's make a few
things clear.

29:25.431 --> 29:28.935
From now on, there is
no more Colleen Stan.

29:28.968 --> 29:30.236
Instead, you will
answer to "K."

29:30.269 --> 29:34.240
And that's not the name Kay,
it's the letter K.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.208
You'll address me as "master"
or "sir,"

29:36.242 --> 29:39.011
and my wife as "ma'am".

29:39.045 --> 29:41.413
You're to treat us
with absolute respect:

29:41.447 --> 29:42.348
You're going to speak
only when spoken to,

29:42.381 --> 29:45.151
and you submit to everything
we tell you.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.319
Understand?

29:49.188 --> 29:53.025
"Yes, master."

29:53.059 --> 29:55.094
Yes, master.

29:56.328 --> 29:59.265
whenever I shout "attention",

29:59.298 --> 30:01.267
you stop whatever you're doing
and you immediately run

30:01.300 --> 30:04.470
to that arch over there.

30:04.503 --> 30:07.373
You remove your gown and you
stand with your head bowed

30:07.406 --> 30:09.608
and your fingers reaching
for the ceiling.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.177
Got that?

30:11.210 --> 30:12.444
Yes, master.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.480
Okay.

30:16.348 --> 30:17.383
Attention!

30:50.249 --> 30:52.218
What are you doing?

30:52.251 --> 30:55.254
I'm training the slave.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.426
Make her get dressed.

31:03.529 --> 31:07.099
Ma'am doesn't like
seeing you naked.

31:07.133 --> 31:09.201
Make sure it doesn't
happen again.

31:09.235 --> 31:12.104
Now put on your gown
and go scrub the floor.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.092
What are you doing?

31:33.125 --> 31:37.563
Don't touch my things.

31:37.596 --> 31:38.230
I'm sorry, ma'am.

31:38.264 --> 31:41.367
I didn't know
it was yours.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.235
Are you a Christian?

31:43.269 --> 31:44.370
That's none of
your business.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.939
Stand up.

31:50.209 --> 31:52.144
You listen to me.

31:52.178 --> 31:54.981
Just 'cause you wormed
your way into our household,

31:55.014 --> 31:57.984
don't think you have
any value to us.

31:58.017 --> 32:00.119
'Cause you don't.

32:00.152 --> 32:02.454
You're only here
to take the pain.

32:05.391 --> 32:07.559
Clean that up.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.106
Hey,
new truck?

32:20.139 --> 32:22.008
Yup.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.276
Gonna work the woodland
up near Lassen this winter.

32:24.310 --> 32:27.679
I noticed you got the windows
all covered up these days.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.181
Everything okay?

32:29.215 --> 32:30.449
Sure.

32:30.482 --> 32:31.417
Helps keep the house cool.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.420
Oh.
Well, listen...

32:34.453 --> 32:37.023
Any chance I could swing by
later this week?

32:37.056 --> 32:38.557
I still need to get
your furnace checked over.

32:38.590 --> 32:42.461
Ah, well... we're just
a little busy right now.

32:42.494 --> 32:43.662
I'll get back to you.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.297
Yeah, well, it's just
I need the new certificate

32:45.331 --> 32:46.432
for the insurance.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.733
Yeah, okay.

32:47.766 --> 32:49.968
I just said,
I'll get back to you.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.446
When you're done,
put these away and fix dinner.

33:08.087 --> 33:11.290
What'd you do that for?

33:11.323 --> 33:13.325
We need to move.

33:24.703 --> 33:26.438
You're doing good.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.476
Push, push, push.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.351
I can see it.
Keep going, push.

33:52.298 --> 33:54.566
Hey, you can come out.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.410
It's a girl.

34:12.118 --> 34:13.418
Can I hold her?

34:26.398 --> 34:31.137
K, meet Amber.

34:31.170 --> 34:32.438
Amber, K.

34:35.507 --> 34:36.442
She's beautiful.

34:36.475 --> 34:39.745
You got
that right.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.583
Okay...

34:54.726 --> 34:56.195
Get back in.

35:26.925 --> 35:27.659
Do you have to
have that so loud?

35:27.693 --> 35:29.495
I'm trying to
get her to sleep.

35:48.947 --> 35:51.283
Your dinner
is ready, master.

35:55.521 --> 35:58.590
Jan?
You comin'?

36:00.226 --> 36:02.228
Shh...

36:03.962 --> 36:05.897
She's really tired.

36:05.931 --> 36:08.900
Well, she's not
the only one.

36:10.769 --> 36:13.772
K didn't set
a fork for me.

36:17.543 --> 36:20.412
Attention!

36:25.551 --> 36:28.387
Why didn't you
lay a fork for my wife?

36:28.420 --> 36:30.856
I did, master.

36:30.889 --> 36:34.926
Mm... then how come
she doesn't have one?

36:34.960 --> 36:36.828
I don't know, master.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.664
Are you calling
my wife a liar?

36:38.697 --> 36:39.531
No, master.

36:39.565 --> 36:42.934
She's a liar,
and she's lazy.

36:42.968 --> 36:45.003
You know, it took her an hour
to clean the kitchen today.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.706
It takes me 45 minutes.

36:47.739 --> 36:48.674
Why does it
take you so long?

36:48.707 --> 36:50.976
I don't know, ma'am.

36:51.009 --> 36:52.411
"I don't know, ma'am."

36:52.444 --> 36:53.011
What's the point in
letting her stay

36:53.044 --> 36:55.414
if she's gonna be lazy?

36:55.447 --> 36:58.450
We should just call the Company
and have them take her away.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.422
Seems to me
you need to be reminded

37:03.455 --> 37:06.325
of your place here.

37:34.720 --> 37:35.554
I reckon you spend
more time talking to him

37:35.587 --> 37:37.689
than you do me.

37:38.924 --> 37:48.634
This isn't
easy for me, you know.

37:48.667 --> 37:52.671
Look, K's
only a problem

37:52.704 --> 37:56.742
if you turn
her into a problem.

37:56.775 --> 37:59.745
What if she tries
to escape?

37:59.778 --> 38:01.813
She's not
going anywhere.

38:03.515 --> 38:06.452
So you need to quit
with the jealousy, Jan.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.653
You're only
hurting yourself.

38:21.767 --> 38:24.636
You know, I was at a Company
party a few weeks back.

38:24.670 --> 38:28.374
I heard this story about
one Company slave.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.876
She lived not far
from here.

38:30.909 --> 38:34.513
Apparently her master
treated her so bad,

38:34.546 --> 38:36.948
even though she
knew the risks,

38:36.982 --> 38:40.085
she figured she
was gonna run away.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.787
So she makes it into town,

38:41.820 --> 38:46.525
she finds a police officer
to ask for help...

38:46.558 --> 38:48.059
But you know what?

38:48.093 --> 38:51.963
Turns out the cop's
a part of the Company too.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.665
So to teach her a lesson,

38:53.699 --> 39:00.539
they had a surgeon cut off
her legs and her arms.

39:00.572 --> 39:02.674
And they cut out
her tongue,

39:02.708 --> 39:06.712
used a soldering gun to take out
her eyes and her ears.

39:08.514 --> 39:11.450
The way I heard it,
they braided her hair

39:11.483 --> 39:14.553
so they could hang her
next to her master's bed.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.054
Fed her through a tube.

39:16.087 --> 39:19.658
Took almost a year
before she finally died.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.863
You're sure lucky you got me,
you know that?

39:41.880 --> 39:42.848
What's going on?

39:42.881 --> 39:45.484
K's coming with me.

39:45.517 --> 39:46.485
She's
supposed to help me

39:46.518 --> 39:47.619
with the grocery shopping.

39:47.653 --> 39:50.589
Yeah, well...
I need a hand.

39:53.525 --> 39:55.994
Don't forget,
I'm working tonight.

40:05.771 --> 40:08.139
There's some fallen lumber
up on the ridge.

40:08.173 --> 40:09.875
If we can get it out,
we can sell it.

40:19.818 --> 40:20.786
You see that guy?

40:20.819 --> 40:23.154
He's a slave-owner.

40:23.188 --> 40:24.723
Don't call me "master"
in front of him

40:24.756 --> 40:27.526
or else he might want
to borrow you.

41:01.092 --> 41:02.794
You seem
different up here.

41:06.097 --> 41:08.967
I like it.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.869
Space to think.

41:14.272 --> 41:15.641
What's up?

41:16.041 --> 41:19.945
You think maybe
I could go home one day?

41:19.978 --> 41:21.713
Well...
as far as I know,

41:21.747 --> 41:24.215
no slave's ever been
allowed to go home.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.585
I don't know if the Company
would ever trust a slave enough

41:26.618 --> 41:28.620
to let them go home.

41:28.654 --> 41:30.522
You can trust me.

41:34.626 --> 41:37.295
I'll tell you what...

41:37.328 --> 41:38.864
I'll let you write
a letter home.

41:38.897 --> 41:41.099
Okay?

41:43.869 --> 41:44.970
Now, don't stop
stacking.

41:48.740 --> 41:51.843
You know,
my Dad does tree work.

41:51.877 --> 41:53.278
Bet you two'd get along.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.948
Ah!
Damn!

41:56.982 --> 41:58.116
Damn!

42:09.294 --> 42:10.896
Hey!

42:10.929 --> 42:13.732
Gimme a hand,
will you?

42:13.765 --> 42:14.766
I can't move here!

42:25.043 --> 42:26.945
Hey!
C'mon, will you?

42:29.948 --> 42:30.882
Let's see.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.922
Okay...
This is gonna hurt.

42:45.964 --> 42:49.367
Never done
that before.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.102
First time
for everything.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.176
You didn't
clean it properly.

42:58.209 --> 43:01.112
I'll do it.
Just go fix dinner.

43:01.146 --> 43:02.881
Yes, ma'am.

43:17.062 --> 43:19.064
Hey, not now.

43:24.402 --> 43:26.872
Do you still
love me, Cam?

43:29.040 --> 43:32.043
I just said
I'm tired here.

43:36.414 --> 43:38.850
Sometimes I think
you care more about K

43:38.884 --> 43:41.219
than you do about me.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.123
I saw you
the other day,

43:45.156 --> 43:48.894
while you were
whipping her.

43:48.927 --> 43:52.998
I know what
you're thinking.

43:53.031 --> 43:55.300
You want her,
don't you?

44:02.340 --> 44:05.143
She's my slave...

44:05.176 --> 44:10.181
But she's your slave too.

44:13.051 --> 44:15.186
We could share her.

44:25.063 --> 44:28.033
Okay.

45:29.995 --> 45:30.962
What's your
problem?

45:30.996 --> 45:31.897
Bastard!

45:31.930 --> 45:32.931
What?
What did I do?

45:32.964 --> 45:34.032
Bastard!

45:34.065 --> 45:36.334
What did I do?
What is your problem, huh?

45:36.367 --> 45:37.836
Jan!

45:39.570 --> 45:40.538
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

45:40.571 --> 45:41.439
Oh, get off me!

45:41.472 --> 45:42.307
What the heck
is wrong with you?

45:42.340 --> 45:45.944
You promised me!
You promised me, Cam!

45:45.977 --> 45:46.945
You promised!

45:46.978 --> 45:47.678
Oh, come on!
It was your idea!

45:47.712 --> 45:50.248
My idea?
We had an agreement!

45:50.281 --> 45:52.383
Come on, look, what is
the big difference, anyways?

45:52.417 --> 45:53.218
I'm your wife!

45:53.251 --> 45:55.286
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

45:57.555 --> 45:59.991
Everything I do
for this marriage,

46:00.025 --> 46:01.426
and you do nothing!

46:01.459 --> 46:03.895
Okay, okay, okay.

46:05.831 --> 46:06.231
What do you want?

46:08.433 --> 46:10.401
Put that bitch
in her box,

46:10.435 --> 46:12.170
and you never
touch her again!

46:33.191 --> 46:35.393
Do you wanna
deal with K?

46:35.426 --> 46:37.462
There's some leftovers
by the sink.

46:44.936 --> 46:47.038
I was thinking we might
take a few days' vacation

46:47.072 --> 46:49.607
up by Lake Tahoe next week.

46:49.640 --> 46:50.308
You fancy that?

46:50.341 --> 46:53.811
Yeah, that'd be nice.

46:58.283 --> 47:00.318
Get out.

47:18.536 --> 47:20.071
That's enough.

47:26.377 --> 47:28.413
Your dinner's
over there.

47:31.049 --> 47:32.383
Thank you, ma'am.

47:37.555 --> 47:39.991
Mama?

47:40.025 --> 47:41.960
Hey, sweetie.

47:41.993 --> 47:44.095
Cam?
Please.

47:48.666 --> 47:50.401
Hey, princess.
You okay?

47:50.435 --> 47:51.436
Yeah.

47:51.469 --> 47:53.471
Okay, come on.

48:00.345 --> 48:02.413
That's Amber?

48:02.447 --> 48:04.449
She's supposed to be
sleeping.

48:07.585 --> 48:09.620
But she's grown up.

48:12.323 --> 48:14.659
How long have
I been in here?

48:22.467 --> 48:24.269
Okay.
Think that's it.

48:24.302 --> 48:25.536
You wanna
bring your jacket?

48:25.570 --> 48:26.537
Nah.

48:26.571 --> 48:28.339
Forecast is good
all week.

49:38.509 --> 49:42.113
Why is this
happening to me?

49:42.147 --> 49:46.217
Pain and suffering
are inevitable in this life.

49:46.251 --> 49:48.753
But all things
work together for good,

49:48.786 --> 49:51.389
for those who love God.

50:13.811 --> 50:16.114
Don't let her be hurt...

50:16.147 --> 50:18.649
Don't let her be hurt...

50:18.683 --> 50:20.651
I heard you
praying for me.

50:20.685 --> 50:23.654
What else am I
going to do?

50:23.688 --> 50:25.523
I'm sorry, Bonnie,
but I need to figure out

50:25.556 --> 50:28.393
why God wants this
to happen to me.

50:28.426 --> 50:31.696
There has to be
a reason, right?

50:31.729 --> 50:34.065
You're only here
to take the pain.

51:42.600 --> 51:45.736
I am here
to protect you.

52:22.607 --> 52:24.309
Wanna put her down
and then make something

52:24.342 --> 52:24.942
for me to eat?

52:24.975 --> 52:27.345
Give me a minute.

52:44.862 --> 52:46.697
Ah, heck.

53:06.451 --> 53:08.453
I was thirsty.

53:14.359 --> 53:16.727
Did you find
any answers?

53:18.629 --> 53:22.333
I'm just trying
to understand.

53:22.367 --> 53:24.769
God says there's a
reason for everything.

53:24.802 --> 53:28.739
Well...

53:28.773 --> 53:30.675
Go figure.

53:32.777 --> 53:34.245
Get in.

53:42.920 --> 53:48.526
"Slaves, obey
your earthly masters

53:48.559 --> 53:51.562
with fear and trembling."

53:54.532 --> 53:56.000
Slaves...

53:58.002 --> 53:59.904
And now a word
from our sponsors...

54:35.340 --> 54:37.007
What have you
been doing?

54:37.041 --> 54:38.943
What's it to you?

54:41.446 --> 54:42.947
Come here.

54:50.721 --> 54:52.022
Listen...

54:52.056 --> 54:55.426
I don't know what your
problem is these days,

54:55.460 --> 54:58.095
but if you're not gonna let me
do bondage any more,

54:58.128 --> 55:00.598
I'm gonna have
to let K out the box.

55:04.502 --> 55:06.604
Are you gonna
sleep with her again?

55:08.373 --> 55:09.006
Probably.

55:11.476 --> 55:14.679
Jan...

55:14.712 --> 55:16.981
Let's face it.

55:17.014 --> 55:19.049
You've been kinda
rough on her.

55:19.083 --> 55:24.121
I mean, it's been a
couple of years, right?

55:24.154 --> 55:25.990
And anyway, the Bible
is quite clear.

55:26.023 --> 55:30.595
A man is entitled to
more than one wife.

55:30.628 --> 55:33.864
So don't you think it's time
you just accept the situation

55:33.898 --> 55:36.434
and start helping
make things work here?

55:37.435 --> 55:41.472
God knows what
we've done, Cam.

55:41.506 --> 55:42.773
He's gonna punish us.

55:42.807 --> 55:44.141
K is not a prisoner.

55:44.174 --> 55:47.878
She's chosen to be here.

55:47.912 --> 55:50.781
It's what she wants,
and it's what I want too.

55:50.815 --> 55:53.618
So if you have problems
with her,

55:53.651 --> 55:55.753
the best thing to do
is try and find and ways

55:55.786 --> 55:57.021
to work them out.

55:57.054 --> 56:00.391
And you want things
to work out, right?

56:13.438 --> 56:16.841
Hey, Amber.
Look who's back.

56:16.874 --> 56:19.910
Hi, K.

56:19.944 --> 56:22.513
Hi, Amber.

56:22.547 --> 56:23.881
How are you?

56:23.914 --> 56:26.083
Fine.

56:26.116 --> 56:28.118
Thank you, ma'am.

57:28.145 --> 57:30.114
Come on out.

57:39.657 --> 57:42.727
Here, take this.

57:42.760 --> 57:44.228
What's this?

57:44.261 --> 57:47.732
I thought we could read
the Bible together.

57:47.765 --> 57:50.601
Cameron says a woman's head
should be covered

57:50.635 --> 57:52.703
in reverence to God.

57:55.573 --> 57:58.175
"So Sarah
said to Abraham,

57:58.208 --> 58:00.010
'See now, the Lord has
restrained me

58:00.044 --> 58:01.646
from bearing children.

58:01.679 --> 58:03.614
Please, go in
to my maid;

58:03.648 --> 58:06.651
perhaps I shall obtain
children by her.'

58:06.684 --> 58:10.888
Then Sarah, Abraham's wife,
took Hagar, her maid,

58:10.921 --> 58:12.489
and gave her
to her husband."

58:16.661 --> 58:20.164
Cameron says
you and I are a bit like

58:20.197 --> 58:23.534
Sarah and Hagar.

58:23.568 --> 58:28.038
Hagar was Abraham's slave,
but, uh...

58:28.072 --> 58:31.275
Sarah had to learn to share
Hagar with her husband.

58:33.277 --> 58:38.048
Except you're a slave too.

58:38.082 --> 58:39.550
With the Company.

58:41.719 --> 58:43.721
Right.

58:45.355 --> 58:49.660
Cameron says we have to learn
to get along better.

58:49.694 --> 58:51.629
So that's what
we're gonna do.

58:51.662 --> 58:53.230
Okay?

58:53.263 --> 58:54.665
Yes, ma'am.

58:54.699 --> 58:58.736
Don't call me that
anymore, please.

58:58.769 --> 59:00.771
Just call me Jan.

59:19.256 --> 59:21.826
Put her to sleep,
then go take a shower

59:21.859 --> 59:24.161
and wait in
the bedroom.

59:24.194 --> 59:26.764
- Hey, sweetie.
- Night-night.

59:40.745 --> 59:41.578
You remember
that time you told me

59:41.612 --> 59:45.950
that everything happens
for a reason?

59:45.983 --> 59:48.385
I think you were right.

59:48.418 --> 59:49.186
I think God
sent you here

59:49.219 --> 59:52.623
because he wants us
to be together.

59:54.759 --> 59:58.863
I think maybe one day
you could even be my slave wife.

01:00:00.865 --> 01:00:03.701
Maybe we could even
have a baby together.

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:11.008
Are you asking me,
or are you telling me?

01:00:11.308 --> 01:00:13.610
I'm asking you.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:16.914
Well, then,
if you're asking me,

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:21.018
then... I don't know if I want
to have a baby with you.

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:22.920
Why not?

01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:26.757
I try to be
a good slave,

01:00:26.791 --> 01:00:28.793
but sometimes I feel like
you still don't trust me.

01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:30.761
That's not true.

01:00:30.795 --> 01:00:33.330
I trust you.
I trust you.

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:39.003
Then let me see
my family.

01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:47.211
I already explained
to you,

01:00:47.244 --> 01:00:48.412
I'm trying to
get it approved,

01:00:48.445 --> 01:00:52.316
but the Company has never let
a slave to go home before.

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:55.753
Not ever.

01:00:56.453 --> 01:00:59.323
Can I ask you something?

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:02.059
Sure.

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:07.097
When did all this
start for you?

01:01:08.232 --> 01:01:09.834
What do you mean?

01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:13.871
The thing for
bondage, torture.

01:01:20.244 --> 01:01:27.084
When I was five,
six years old...

01:01:27.117 --> 01:01:30.855
I started drawing pictures
of women tied up.

01:01:32.923 --> 01:01:35.359
Then I met Jan,
and...

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:37.227
she was the first one
who would let me

01:01:37.261 --> 01:01:40.230
try things out on her.

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:41.932
But the problem is that
she's never been able

01:01:41.966 --> 01:01:44.434
to handle it really well.

01:01:44.468 --> 01:01:47.972
Not like you.

01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:52.109
What would you do if someone
did this to your daughter?

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:54.711
I'd kill them.

01:01:58.282 --> 01:02:00.985
Then how do you think
my Dad feels?

01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:09.359
Get in the box.

01:02:20.204 --> 01:02:21.538
How's that?

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:22.372
It's nice.

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:25.409
Never had anyone
do my hair before.

01:02:25.442 --> 01:02:27.978
Thank you.

01:02:28.012 --> 01:02:28.846
Pretty.

01:02:28.879 --> 01:02:31.548
And you are too,
little one.

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:35.853
Jesus said,
"If you were blind,

01:02:35.886 --> 01:02:39.289
you would not be
guilty of sin.

01:02:39.323 --> 01:02:43.160
But now that you
claim you can see,

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:48.032
still your guilt remains."

01:02:49.366 --> 01:02:53.237
We cannot pull the wool
over the eyes of the Lord.

01:03:07.217 --> 01:03:10.454
You're looking better.

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:12.923
What are you planting?

01:03:12.957 --> 01:03:13.557
Beans.

01:03:17.061 --> 01:03:20.530
Uh, when I'm working...

01:03:20.564 --> 01:03:24.368
does... does Cameron
spend time with you?

01:03:27.104 --> 01:03:29.506
I only do what
Master tells me.

01:03:39.984 --> 01:03:41.952
I gotta get ready
for work.

01:03:49.393 --> 01:03:51.495
Okay?

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:53.530
Okay.

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:55.966
It's like a rainbow now.

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:02.072
Hey.

01:04:02.106 --> 01:04:05.109
Go fix dinner.

01:04:05.142 --> 01:04:07.011
She-- she'll be there
in a minute.

01:04:07.044 --> 01:04:07.577
We're just
finishing up a game.

01:04:07.611 --> 01:04:11.081
What?

01:04:11.115 --> 01:04:13.650
Uh, K will be there
in a second.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.519
We're just playing
with Amber.

01:04:15.552 --> 01:04:16.987
Get in the bedroom.

01:04:24.528 --> 01:04:27.364
Mama?

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:29.066
It's okay, sweetie.
Um...

01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:31.435
Why don't you play with K
for a minute?

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:35.305
Mommy will be
right back.

01:04:35.339 --> 01:04:36.941
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:48.385
Why is mama crying?

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:49.353
It's okay,
sweetheart.

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:50.687
Let's go play a game of
Hide and Seek, okay?

01:05:37.501 --> 01:05:40.170
It's like
a miracle.

01:05:41.005 --> 01:05:44.108
The Company said that
you can visit home.

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:46.776
Really?

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.979
I know, right?

01:05:49.013 --> 01:05:50.614
Do you realize you're
the first slave

01:05:50.647 --> 01:05:52.649
who's been allowed
to visit home?

01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:54.985
How?

01:05:55.019 --> 01:05:57.221
How did you
convince them?

01:05:57.254 --> 01:05:59.423
It wasn't easy,
believe me.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:03.760
How soon
can I go?

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:07.664
Real soon,
real soon.

01:06:10.134 --> 01:06:13.537
But listen.
Here's the thing.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:16.340
My reputation with the Company
is on the line here,

01:06:16.373 --> 01:06:18.775
so they insisted that you
pass some obedience tests

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:22.512
to make sure that
they can trust you.

01:06:22.546 --> 01:06:24.548
What do I have to do?

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:31.188
Point this towards you,

01:06:31.221 --> 01:06:33.023
and put the barrel
in your mouth.

01:06:56.713 --> 01:06:59.516
Now, pull the trigger.

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:31.448
Let's write your folks.

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:41.858
[Music pl

01:07:53.437 --> 01:07:55.139
You know, I really
stuck my neck out for you

01:07:55.172 --> 01:07:56.273
to make this trip.

01:07:56.306 --> 01:07:58.675
All the extra security
almost cost me

01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:00.844
fifteen hundred bucks.

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:03.213
How did you afford it?

01:08:03.247 --> 01:08:06.183
I used to transport slaves
for the Company.

01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:08.152
I'm calling in credit.

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:10.587
Thank you.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:11.721
You're welcome.

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:17.461
* Baby, let's take
the world on tonight *

01:08:21.198 --> 01:08:22.299
It's just up here
on the left.

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:24.368
Yeah, I know.

01:08:35.212 --> 01:08:37.214
Remember, the
whole time you're here,

01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:39.716
the Company's gonna be
watching the house

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:41.850
and listening in.

01:08:41.885 --> 01:08:43.853
So you'd best
not screw up,

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.322
or someone's likely
to get hurt.

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:47.857
I won't.

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:49.593
I won't screw up.

01:08:59.903 --> 01:09:01.337
Aah!

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:02.639
Oh my God!

01:09:04.308 --> 01:09:05.309
Hi, Dad!

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:07.344
Come here, you!

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:10.580
Oh boy,
you lost weight!

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:11.581
Hey!

01:09:11.615 --> 01:09:12.549
Oh!

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:14.651
- Sorry, this is Mike.
- Hi.

01:09:14.684 --> 01:09:16.386
Hey Mike,
how are ya?

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.388
Uh, listen,
I've gotta get going,

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:20.924
but I'll see all you
folks later.

01:09:20.957 --> 01:09:23.260
Here, let me
take your jacket...

01:09:33.937 --> 01:09:35.372
I know, can you
believe it? Yeah!

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:36.906
Don't listen to her,
don't listen to her!

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:38.742
No, I'm certain
I saw you that morning!

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:40.377
You say this every time!
Don't listen to her.

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:41.310
Smile!

01:09:42.312 --> 01:09:43.779
Nice.

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:45.782
So you remember
Don and Carrie?

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:46.783
Yeah, of course.

01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:48.484
They just had
another baby.

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:49.353
Oh, wow,
is that two?

01:09:49.386 --> 01:09:51.854
No, that's six.

01:09:52.322 --> 01:09:53.290
Six?

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:55.659
Yeah.

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:56.526
Wow...

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.527
Don loves his wife,
what can you say?

01:09:57.561 --> 01:09:59.929
I think he just eats
too much red meat,

01:09:59.963 --> 01:10:00.964
if you ask me.

01:10:02.366 --> 01:10:06.002
So, you gonna tell us
about this new guy?

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:07.271
What's his name, again?

01:10:07.304 --> 01:10:08.272
Mike.

01:10:08.305 --> 01:10:09.939
It's a shame
he couldn't stick around.

01:10:09.973 --> 01:10:10.740
Would have liked to
meet him.

01:10:10.774 --> 01:10:11.441
Oh, well, I'm sure
you'll meet him

01:10:11.475 --> 01:10:13.410
at some point
or another.

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:15.312
He had to go to
a work conference.

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:17.647
What does he do?

01:10:17.681 --> 01:10:19.316
Something
with computers.

01:10:19.349 --> 01:10:20.417
Um... I don't know
exactly.

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:24.288
You never asked?

01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:26.990
He doesn't like to talk
about his work so much.

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:29.893
Excuse me.

01:10:34.631 --> 01:10:36.966
Are we really just gonna
talk around this all day?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:37.534
It's obvious that
something's not right.

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:39.303
Just let her be.

01:10:39.336 --> 01:10:41.305
Come on!

01:10:41.338 --> 01:10:43.707
She's wearing handmade chinos,
for heaven's sake.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:44.874
That's not Colleen.

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:46.843
- Hey...
- And her hair, Dad!

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:49.479
Hey!
We talked about this.

01:10:49.513 --> 01:10:51.515
Don't push her with a bunch of
questions, alright?

01:10:51.548 --> 01:10:54.318
If she's involved in
a cult or something,

01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:55.652
the last thing
we want to be doing

01:10:55.685 --> 01:10:57.621
is frightening her off.

01:10:57.654 --> 01:10:59.523
The main thing is
she's here.

01:11:00.557 --> 01:11:01.791
I mean it, Bonnie.

01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:09.899
Who's for apple pie?

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:12.636
You looked
so cute there!

01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:14.771
Oh, man...

01:11:14.804 --> 01:11:17.407
Nice dress.

01:11:17.441 --> 01:11:20.744
You look so sweet.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:22.379
Aw, yeah...

01:11:22.412 --> 01:11:25.882
Okay, well, I'm gonna
turn in for the night.

01:11:25.915 --> 01:11:28.552
It's been a long day.

01:11:29.653 --> 01:11:32.756
Goodnight, Dad.
I love you.

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:34.624
I love you too.

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:36.025
You're here for a
couple of days, yeah?

01:11:36.059 --> 01:11:36.993
Till Monday.

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:38.628
Alright, we'll see you
in the morning.

01:11:38.662 --> 01:11:39.763
Goodnight.

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:43.733
Where were we?

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:45.635
That was your
cousin's wedding.

01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:47.036
Susan got married?

01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:49.072
Mm-hm.

01:11:51.575 --> 01:11:53.510
You know, it
would have been nice

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:55.545
if you'd been there.

01:11:57.681 --> 01:12:01.785
I wish I'd
been there too.

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:05.054
So why weren't you?

01:12:05.088 --> 01:12:09.559
I mean, we didn't hear
from you in so long...

01:12:09.593 --> 01:12:10.627
For all we knew,
you might have been dead.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:14.063
- Bonnie, don't say that.
- No, but it's true.

01:12:14.097 --> 01:12:15.665
You used to write
every week,

01:12:15.699 --> 01:12:18.535
and then all of a sudden,
nothing.

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:20.537
What was I
supposed to think?

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:24.774
Bonnie, I...
I've been busy.

01:12:24.808 --> 01:12:27.811
Oh, come on, Colleen.
Too busy to write?

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:29.413
Too busy to, like,
pick up a phone?

01:12:29.446 --> 01:12:32.416
Bonnie, please,
I love you...

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:38.388
But I just, I can't talk
about this right now.

01:12:38.588 --> 01:12:41.357
Why?

01:12:43.993 --> 01:12:46.496
I'm really tired.
I should get to bed.

01:12:57.841 --> 01:12:58.675
I should take you
and show you the shop

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:01.110
- later on or something.
- Yeah.

01:13:01.144 --> 01:13:02.646
Go have a look at that.
Yeah, yeah.

01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:04.047
Things have changed,
things have changed.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.415
Colleen, you wanna
give me a hand?

01:13:05.449 --> 01:13:08.618
Sure.
You all done?

01:13:08.652 --> 01:13:11.421
You bet,
yeah.

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:20.497
Hey, listen, Colleen.
Last night, I...

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:25.569
Bonnie, can we just
enjoy our time together?

01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:28.104
Please?

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:30.106
Well, are we gonna be
seeing more of you?

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:33.577
I hope so.

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:37.447
You hope so?
You're not sure?

01:13:38.515 --> 01:13:43.587
Colleen, I can tell
something's up.

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:46.456
You know you can
tell me anything, right?

01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:50.694
Colleen?

01:13:50.727 --> 01:13:55.131
You wanna tell me
what's really going on?

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:57.901
Colleen?
You got a visitor.

01:13:59.636 --> 01:14:00.604
Hi.

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:08.812
Hi.

01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:09.746
Hey.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:12.882
I thought you weren't
coming until tomorrow.

01:14:12.916 --> 01:14:16.152
Yeah, conference, uh,
finished early.

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:24.628
You wanna grab
your stuff?

01:14:24.661 --> 01:14:27.497
Been at a work seminar
up in Portland,

01:14:27.531 --> 01:14:28.765
and we figured
it was a great chance

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:29.766
to come and visit
you folks.

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:32.569
I know, uh, Colleen's
been keen to see you.

01:14:32.602 --> 01:14:36.205
Yeah, well, it's...
it's been a while.

01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:37.774
It has.

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:41.645
Oh, I'm sorry,
this is my wife, Ruth.

01:14:41.678 --> 01:14:43.547
And this is Colleen's
sister, Bonnie.

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:44.914
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.
- Nice to meet you.

01:14:44.948 --> 01:14:45.982
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:14:46.015 --> 01:14:48.518
Well, how long you guys
known each other?

01:14:48.552 --> 01:14:53.790
Oh, just
a few months.

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:56.125
Uh, I don't know if she said,
but we're, uh...

01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:58.194
We're actually planning
on getting married pretty soon.

01:14:58.227 --> 01:14:59.663
What?

01:14:59.696 --> 01:15:00.697
No, she did not.

01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:04.200
She kept those cards
pretty close to her chest.

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:05.535
Wow, that's
good for you.

01:15:05.569 --> 01:15:07.537
That's... great.

01:15:08.304 --> 01:15:11.675
You never said you were
getting married.

01:15:11.708 --> 01:15:13.677
Oh, I...

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:15.545
It's just we hadn't decided
to make it official.

01:15:15.579 --> 01:15:18.548
Sorry, I figured now
was as good a time as any

01:15:18.582 --> 01:15:20.617
to give them the news.

01:15:20.650 --> 01:15:21.685
Well, I think
it's wonderful.

01:15:21.718 --> 01:15:23.953
I'm gonna get
the camera.

01:15:23.987 --> 01:15:25.689
Yeah, well, have you got
a date picked out?

01:15:25.722 --> 01:15:28.091
No, no.
Uh...

01:15:28.124 --> 01:15:30.093
Hopefully we'll
fix something up soon.

01:15:30.126 --> 01:15:33.129
Alright, well, you
be sure and let us know.

01:15:33.162 --> 01:15:34.598
So where you guys
living now?

01:15:34.631 --> 01:15:36.833
California.

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:38.234
Hm...

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:40.570
I thought you said that
you were here in Oregon?

01:15:40.604 --> 01:15:43.707
We're just moving to
Klamath Falls right now.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:47.243
Alright, well,
you got a number?

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:48.612
Well, like
Colleen said,

01:15:48.645 --> 01:15:50.046
we're kind of in
the process of moving.

01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:52.248
But we'll be sure to get
you guys all the contact details

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:53.717
just as soon
as we're settled.

01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:54.851
Yeah, alright.

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:55.819
Let's get a picture
of the happy couple, okay?

01:15:55.852 --> 01:15:57.987
- Oh, sure, sure.
- Get together.

01:15:59.155 --> 01:16:01.024
Nice, okay.
One more.

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:02.258
Yeah?

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:05.294
Oh, yay, got it.
Great.

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:08.732
Well, we'd better
get going.

01:16:08.765 --> 01:16:10.600
You know, we've got quite
a long drive ahead of us.

01:16:10.634 --> 01:16:11.635
It was good to
meet you, Mike.

01:16:11.668 --> 01:16:12.836
Bye, sweetie...

01:16:12.869 --> 01:16:14.604
You take good care
of her.

01:16:14.638 --> 01:16:16.873
Don't worry.
I will.

01:16:21.778 --> 01:16:22.946
Before I met you,

01:16:22.979 --> 01:16:26.616
your life was going
the wrong way.

01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:30.820
Now you're at
a crossroads.

01:16:30.854 --> 01:16:33.623
One path leads
to righteousness,

01:16:33.657 --> 01:16:37.060
the other leads to hell.

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:37.694
And now it's time
for you to choose

01:16:37.727 --> 01:16:40.697
which way you want to go.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:48.171
I think it's time
you and I got married.

01:16:48.204 --> 01:16:49.639
What about Ma'am?

01:16:49.673 --> 01:16:52.776
She'll learn to
accept it eventually.

01:16:52.809 --> 01:16:54.911
I was thinking we
could fix you up

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:56.680
with your own
place here.

01:16:56.713 --> 01:16:59.082
Really?

01:16:59.115 --> 01:16:59.816
I'd like that.

01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:05.288
So... you ready to start
a family with me?

01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:10.794
Ah, damn.

01:17:19.168 --> 01:17:20.804
Hey.

01:17:20.837 --> 01:17:26.075
You're home early.
What's up?

01:17:26.109 --> 01:17:28.077
Nothing.
I'm tired.

01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:40.256
What are you doing?

01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:40.757
Leaving.

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:42.726
Leaving?

01:17:42.759 --> 01:17:45.094
What do you mean?
Where are you going?

01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:48.364
I don't know.
To my parents'.

01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:50.099
But what happened?

01:17:50.133 --> 01:17:51.735
What happened...?

01:17:51.768 --> 01:17:57.741
Somehow, there's one too many
people in my marriage.

01:17:57.774 --> 01:17:59.008
But you can't--
you can't leave.

01:17:59.042 --> 01:18:00.409
Cameron needs us both.

01:18:00.443 --> 01:18:04.180
Maybe.
But he only wants you.

01:18:04.213 --> 01:18:06.716
Come on, honey,
Grandpa's waiting outside.

01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:08.417
Bye, K.

01:18:08.451 --> 01:18:10.053
Bye.

01:18:10.086 --> 01:18:11.687
What's going on?

01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:15.158
Hey!

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:17.761
You wanna tell me
what this is all about?

01:18:17.794 --> 01:18:19.996
I'm sorry, Cam,
I can't do this anymore.

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:21.865
You, K, all of it.

01:18:21.898 --> 01:18:25.401
Come on, Jan.
Get back inside the house.

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:28.838
I'm serious, if you
won't end it, I will.

01:18:28.872 --> 01:18:31.174
What's that
supposed to mean, huh?

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:34.778
What are you gonna do?
You gonna go to the police?

01:18:34.811 --> 01:18:35.578
Maybe.

01:18:35.611 --> 01:18:38.181
Maybe I'll tell
them everything.

01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:40.216
Sure, go ahead.

01:18:40.249 --> 01:18:42.852
If you do that, you can
kiss Amber goodbye.

01:18:42.886 --> 01:18:44.821
Well, at least I won't be
burning in hell.

01:18:44.854 --> 01:18:45.755
Hey,
you know what?

01:18:45.789 --> 01:18:47.256
Don't try and pin
everything on me here.

01:18:47.290 --> 01:18:48.825
You got exactly
what you wanted.

01:18:48.858 --> 01:18:50.326
Oh, you think
this is what I wanted?

01:19:13.282 --> 01:19:16.119
Can I get you
anything?

01:19:22.826 --> 01:19:28.031
What the hell do you
think you're doing, huh?

01:19:28.064 --> 01:19:30.066
I'm sorry...
I don't understand.

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:31.300
Attention!

01:19:36.906 --> 01:19:38.842
Who do you
think you are?

01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:41.945
You think you can just wear
whatever you want now?

01:19:41.978 --> 01:19:44.480
Huh?
Is that it?

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:49.485
Answer me when
I speak to you.

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:52.521
I said,
"Is that it?"

01:19:53.022 --> 01:19:54.423
No.

01:19:54.457 --> 01:19:56.525
"No, master"!

01:19:56.559 --> 01:19:57.994
What happened to
showing some respect?

01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:03.867
Come with me.

01:20:13.877 --> 01:20:15.111
Get in.

01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:27.256
Told you I'd
get you your own place.

01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:30.994
Don't worry, you
won't be on your own.

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:36.032
There's room
for plenty more.

01:22:00.616 --> 01:22:02.085
We should get going
before Cameron gets back.

01:22:02.118 --> 01:22:04.187
I thought
you'd left.

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:07.023
You're the one
who needs to leave.

01:22:07.056 --> 01:22:08.091
Leave?

01:22:08.124 --> 01:22:10.226
What are you
talking about?

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:12.661
Cameron's just angry right now,
it'll be okay.

01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:25.141
There was
another girl...

01:22:25.174 --> 01:22:26.976
before you.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:30.513
What do you mean?

01:22:30.546 --> 01:22:33.516
Her name was Marlitz.

01:22:33.549 --> 01:22:37.486
We picked her up near Mineral,
about a year before we met you.

01:22:39.155 --> 01:22:41.357
Cameron used to drive me
to the woods out there

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:43.993
and hang me up.

01:22:44.027 --> 01:22:47.496
She was hitching,
just like you.

01:22:48.664 --> 01:22:53.569
He said it would be fine,
that it was just a game.

01:22:55.204 --> 01:22:58.407
And then when he
got her home,

01:22:58.441 --> 01:23:01.410
she wouldn't
stop screaming.

01:23:04.347 --> 01:23:08.051
We buried her...
out near Quincy.

01:23:12.055 --> 01:23:16.292
Every day,
I have prayed to God

01:23:16.325 --> 01:23:19.428
that I could
change what happened,

01:23:19.462 --> 01:23:22.298
that-- that he would
forgive me.

01:23:23.466 --> 01:23:28.237
But, uh, maybe some people
aren't meant to be forgiven.

01:23:30.106 --> 01:23:34.577
Maybe some sins
are unforgivable.

01:24:08.111 --> 01:24:09.545
Bus will be here
any minute.

01:24:18.187 --> 01:24:20.656
Will you be okay?

01:24:20.689 --> 01:24:23.359
I don't know.

01:24:23.392 --> 01:24:24.360
I don't know
anything anymore.

01:24:34.737 --> 01:24:36.739
I can stay
if you want.

01:24:39.542 --> 01:24:43.279
You need to go home.

01:24:43.312 --> 01:24:47.416
But what about the Company?
Won't they track us down?

01:24:52.155 --> 01:24:54.390
Cameron was never
in the Company.
