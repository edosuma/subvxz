00:03.046 --> 00:05.483
Welcome
to Abnormal Behavioral Analysis.

00:05.527 --> 00:07.094
My name is
Professor Dylan Reinhart.

00:07.137 --> 00:09.444
Detective
Elizabeth Needham, NYPD.

00:11.968 --> 00:13.622
You're not just
some boring old professor.

00:13.665 --> 00:16.016
You're CIA?
Retired?

00:16.059 --> 00:17.495
DYLAN:
You can't access
sealed documents?

00:17.539 --> 00:19.149
That's why they're sealed.That's why I have friends.

00:19.193 --> 00:22.935
Don't tell me-- you need intel,
and the NYPD's slowing you down.

00:22.979 --> 00:25.286
Just in case.If I were to call,
what would I call you?

00:25.329 --> 00:26.243
Julian.

00:28.332 --> 00:31.988
Lizzie, Dylan, meet Jules,
our new computer associate.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.511
Nice to meet you both.

00:33.555 --> 00:36.079
I went to the precinct because
I wanted to be near you.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.298
For this to work,

00:37.341 --> 00:39.343
we both have to take some risks.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.737
Keeping secrets is
what keeps me alive.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.130
Are you here to report a crime?

00:43.173 --> 00:45.001
No, uh, I'm here
to investigate one.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.090
Detective Ryan Stock,
Garfield County PD.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.700
They sent Detective Stock

00:48.744 --> 00:51.964
to aid Fucci in the effort to
connect and solve both murders.

00:52.008 --> 00:54.184
LIZZIE: You're gonna be a great father.

00:54.228 --> 00:56.056
Any child would be lucky
to have you and Andy

00:56.099 --> 00:57.448
as their dads.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.276
I combed through all
the adoption information

00:59.320 --> 01:00.843
you gathered.

01:00.886 --> 01:03.106
I'm saying
let's pursue them all.

01:12.420 --> 01:16.076
That's it for tonight. I have to
get up early for court tomorrow.

01:16.119 --> 01:20.123
If the judge says I should live
with Grandma and Grandpa,

01:20.167 --> 01:22.256
will I get to finish
my book with them?

01:22.299 --> 01:24.040
Sure.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.086
I don't think Grandma
likes vampires.

01:26.129 --> 01:29.132
Probably not, Satan's work.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.091
Yeah, but you can
read it alone,

01:31.134 --> 01:33.093
or you could read it to Cheetah.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.921
Cheetah loves
vampires.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.097
[both chuckle]

01:37.140 --> 01:39.925
Go ahead, finish your milk.

01:47.672 --> 01:49.239
Don't I have to brush my teeth?

01:49.283 --> 01:51.241
Not tonight.

01:54.766 --> 01:57.160
All right, scooch down.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.692
Love you.Love you.

[phone buzzes]

02:28.800 --> 02:30.759
[beeps]

02:39.985 --> 02:42.249
I always kind of liked
this photo of you.

02:42.292 --> 02:44.555
Uh-huh. Yeah, that's 'cause
I was seducing you.

02:44.599 --> 02:45.817
Hmm?

02:45.861 --> 02:48.080
The whole point of
making an adoption book

02:48.124 --> 02:49.778
is to introduce us
to birth mothers,

02:49.821 --> 02:51.214
not to scare them off.

02:51.258 --> 02:53.216
Okay, you're right.
Do we have any of you bowling

02:53.260 --> 02:55.827
or caulking tiles?
[laughs]

02:55.871 --> 02:58.178
Hey, this one would go well
with my intro for you.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.831
"Andy thinks Dylan
would make a good father

02:59.875 --> 03:01.355
"because Dylan

03:01.398 --> 03:03.400
"understands people better
than anyone I know,

03:03.444 --> 03:05.315
and he loves them
for who they are."

03:05.359 --> 03:09.363
You-you memorized it?
I-I-I haven't even...

03:09.406 --> 03:10.973

03:11.016 --> 03:12.670
You haven't started
it yet, have you?

03:12.714 --> 03:15.369
All right, well, since you
work better with a deadline,

03:15.412 --> 03:17.719
let's say this book will be
finished by Saturday, shall we?

03:17.762 --> 03:19.286
This Saturday?
Mm-hmm.

03:19.329 --> 03:22.245
I-I-Is that realistic with all
the hours you work? I mean...

03:22.289 --> 03:23.638
Well, I'm cutting back.

03:23.681 --> 03:25.553
I plan to promote Sam to
Rafters manager tomorrow.

03:25.596 --> 03:27.642
Now, Sam is the new girl
you've been raving about?

03:27.685 --> 03:29.992
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I mean,
that's a great idea,

03:30.035 --> 03:31.950
but can you really
work less shifts?

03:31.994 --> 03:33.474
Look, I'm not the workaholic
in this family.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.040
You've got that covered.

03:35.084 --> 03:37.521
I plan to introduce our child
to the other joys in life,

03:37.565 --> 03:41.699
like, uh, bowling or
drinking kegs of beer.

03:41.743 --> 03:43.745
[chuckles]

03:45.268 --> 03:48.924
You know, this is gonna
take some time.

03:48.967 --> 03:52.884
Our baby is not gonna
magically appear.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.454
Neither is your intro of me,
so get writing, all right?

03:57.498 --> 03:59.848
I want a working
draft in 24 hours.

03:59.891 --> 04:01.676
Aye, aye, sir.

Oh.

Room service is here,

04:19.520 --> 04:22.871
and, uh, you know,
there is an upside to Jasmine

04:22.914 --> 04:23.959
crashing at my place.

04:24.002 --> 04:25.874
How much did
you just hear?

04:25.917 --> 04:27.354
Sounded like Russian.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.269
And you're fluent in Serbian,
so it's safe to say...

04:29.312 --> 04:32.010
Yes, my surveillance
netted the high-value intel

04:32.054 --> 04:33.838
that "someone needs an answer."

04:33.882 --> 04:36.232
So pretending

04:36.276 --> 04:39.844
to be a software security nerd
is not your only job these days?

You know it's not.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.673
I have to support this

Oh, don't start that again.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.111

I believe you live here.

04:46.155 --> 04:47.199

04:47.243 --> 04:48.766

all of your stuff?

hideout full of gold bullion

04:52.161 --> 04:54.729

waiting for the highest bidder.

04:54.772 --> 04:57.775
I don't deal in arms.

04:57.819 --> 05:00.822
Yeah, so you say,
but you won't even tell me

05:00.865 --> 05:03.912
what you're really doing
at the precinct.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.828

get him for good tomorrow,

Is there a body?
Not yet.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.801
Well, good. But they think it's
homicide and not a kidnapping?

06:50.845 --> 06:53.195
Either's possible. Blood
at the scene matches the boy.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.327

one of the parties

06:55.371 --> 06:57.939

the NYPD blew it

But the dad is our prime...Hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.321
What about depending
on my superpowers?

11:10.365 --> 11:11.540
Oh, this is gonna haunt me.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.368
You have no idea.

11:13.411 --> 11:17.459
DYLAN: Is there any possibility
that Robby could have run away?

11:17.502 --> 11:21.376
ALFARO: Run away? No.
Absolutely no chance.

11:21.419 --> 11:22.812
Our little Beto would
never run away.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.248
You have to know Robby.

11:24.292 --> 11:26.598
He's a sweet boy.
He doesn't misbehave.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.252
ALFARO: And he's timid,
afraid of the dark.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.298
No way he would go
out that window.

11:30.341 --> 11:34.084
And he wanted to live with us.
He told us so.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.520
May we borrow this one, please?

11:37.044 --> 11:38.480
DYLAN:
We will return it.

11:38.523 --> 11:41.352
We know how precious
family photos are.
Thank you.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.746
Please. Please find him.

11:43.790 --> 11:47.010
I-I was praying that
we'd finally have him safe

11:47.054 --> 11:48.925
in our arms today.

11:48.969 --> 11:51.754
Why would someone do this?Not "someone."

11:51.798 --> 11:53.495
His own father, Will.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.845
He took
our Mimi from us,

11:55.889 --> 11:58.282
and now he's done it again.

12:11.992 --> 12:14.951
That bastard pushed our daughter
off their terrace.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.779
A neighbor even saw them
fighting that day,

12:16.823 --> 12:18.955
but it took you guys
weeks to charge him,

12:18.999 --> 12:20.696
and by then he and
his lawyer cooked up

12:20.740 --> 12:22.785
that our daughter was suicidal.

12:22.829 --> 12:25.875
Will is violent. She never
should've been with him.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.268
You've seen him lose his temper?

12:27.311 --> 12:29.444
Too many times.

12:29.487 --> 12:30.271
And you and your wife
had custody

12:30.314 --> 12:31.228
of Robby during the trial?

12:31.272 --> 12:32.316
After Will got off,

12:32.360 --> 12:33.622
we sued for sole custody.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.058
That's when he ran off
with Robby.

12:36.668 --> 12:39.715
You knew about that, right?
He kidnapped Robby before.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.544
We were briefed of the
custodial interruption, yeah.

12:42.587 --> 12:45.286
Call it what you want.
It should have been a felony.

12:45.329 --> 12:47.854
He crossed state lines,
he only served a year.

12:47.897 --> 12:49.507
And Robby lived
with you then, too?

12:49.551 --> 12:52.772
Mostly. My wife was
having chemo then,

12:52.815 --> 12:54.904
so Robby spent some time with
his godparents, the Lockharts.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.299
Yes, we've put in
a call to them, too.

12:58.342 --> 13:02.433
[sighs] Yeah, Will's
probably back on drugs.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.392
He is under arrest, right?

13:04.435 --> 13:05.959
At this point, no, he's...Oh, for crying out loud.

13:06.002 --> 13:09.527
Uh, charge him with
child endangerment at least.

13:09.571 --> 13:11.573
He left the boy alone.

13:16.360 --> 13:19.015
You know we could charge you
right now with neglect.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.234
WILL:
Go ahead

13:20.277 --> 13:22.018
and lock me up.
Stop asking me questions

13:22.062 --> 13:23.585
I've already answered
and go find my son.

13:23.628 --> 13:24.804
Every precinct

13:24.847 --> 13:27.458
in the city is working
to find Robby.

13:27.502 --> 13:30.200
Sorry, I'm just going nuts here.

13:30.244 --> 13:32.333
Look, I know I screwed up,

13:32.376 --> 13:34.378
but the alarm was set
and the window was locked.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.554
I was gone for half an hour,
maybe 40 minutes.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.384
Can't be the only single parent
who's ever run an errand.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.996
And when you left, you
went where, exactly?

13:43.039 --> 13:45.607
There's a woman I sponsor
through N.A.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.609
She calls when she's triggered.

13:47.652 --> 13:50.351
I've kept her away from the
apartment, for Robby's sake,

13:50.394 --> 13:52.875
but also so the Alfaros don't
use it against me in court.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.399
So this woman
is your alibi?

13:55.443 --> 13:57.445
No.

13:57.488 --> 14:01.014
For the umpteenth time, the
other cop's checking with her.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.930
She didn't show, I headed home.

14:03.973 --> 14:06.367
But you stopped
by the bodega first.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.586
Yeah.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.371
And bought what?

14:11.676 --> 14:12.677
Bleach.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.594
I needed a clean shirt
for court.

14:16.638 --> 14:21.817
Do you think there's any chance
Robby took off on his own?

14:21.861 --> 14:24.951
Never. He wanted to stay
with me. He told me so.

14:26.778 --> 14:29.259
Robby is a very sweet boy,

14:29.303 --> 14:32.654
but he's very timid.

14:32.697 --> 14:35.178
I was sick when I saw Cheetah.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.398
Cheetah, the-the stuffed monkey?

14:37.441 --> 14:38.965
Robby's scared
to sleep without him.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.705
He'd never leave Cheetah behind.

14:40.749 --> 14:43.186
When was the last time you used?

14:45.014 --> 14:46.798
I've already peed for you guys.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.888
I'll do it again,
and it'll be clean.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.454
It's been clean for seven years.

14:50.498 --> 14:54.067
So you were using
when you met Mimi?

14:54.110 --> 14:57.026
Yeah, that's how we met,
in rehab.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.681
Oh, I'll bet the Alfaros
didn't mention that.

14:59.724 --> 15:02.336
Her parents
hated me the most

15:02.379 --> 15:04.381
because I wasn't rich
or important enough

15:04.425 --> 15:06.644
for their daughter,
but they didn't know Mimi.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.298
They couldn't accept
that she was depressed;

15:08.342 --> 15:10.953
they just wanted her
to go to church.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.955
You think the dad checks out?

15:12.999 --> 15:14.522
I'm not saying
turn him loose.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.785
God, no. Keep him talking.
He's loaded with rage.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.569
His son is missing.

15:18.613 --> 15:19.744
JASMINE:
Unless he prepped for this.

15:19.788 --> 15:20.963
He's hip to the system.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.879
He's been through
interrogations before.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.055
I'm sorry, it's hard to take
anything you say seriously,

15:26.099 --> 15:28.536
wearing whatever
that is.

15:28.579 --> 15:29.841
Rubber underpants.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.104
Do you think I like this?

15:31.147 --> 15:32.279
Actually, I find
the grandfather's affect

15:32.322 --> 15:33.845
more disconcerting.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.369
He was more eager
to point a finger

15:35.412 --> 15:38.067
than he was to show concern
for his missing grandchild.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.547
Or grieving wife.

15:39.590 --> 15:41.114
So you're not calling anyone
a murderer yet?

15:41.157 --> 15:42.071
DYLAN:
Not yet.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.290
This is a unique case.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.422
Usually, we start
with a dead body,

15:45.466 --> 15:47.424
but could the dad
or the grandparents

15:47.468 --> 15:51.211
be hiding a plan
that went wrong? Maybe.

15:51.254 --> 15:53.300
And what if the odds
are against us,

15:53.343 --> 15:55.041
and this is a random stranger?

15:55.084 --> 15:58.000
Double down on predator
parolees, all five boroughs.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.828
Any wobble to their
story, drag 'em in.

15:59.871 --> 16:00.829
On it.

16:00.872 --> 16:01.873
After you put on some clothes.

16:01.917 --> 16:02.787
Oy.

16:02.831 --> 16:03.832
What was Will's demeanor like

16:03.875 --> 16:04.876
five years ago,
during the trial?

16:04.920 --> 16:06.835
Slippery.
His alibi kept evolving,

16:06.878 --> 16:08.402
but it ended in a hung jury.

16:08.445 --> 16:12.319
I pulled some articles
and old news footage for you.

16:12.362 --> 16:15.191
Her husband claims
he was picking up

16:15.235 --> 16:17.541
their four-year-old
when she fell to her death.

16:17.585 --> 16:18.978
But today
the babysitter testified

16:19.021 --> 16:21.197
he arrived late that day.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.941
Ah, finally, the light of day.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.552
Ryan of Mayberry here has had me
trapped in witness interviews

16:28.596 --> 16:30.728
since the wee hours.

16:30.772 --> 16:32.992
Yeah, just making sure
Manhattan's Finest here

16:33.035 --> 16:34.558
didn't miss any more
Nebraska clues

16:34.602 --> 16:35.864
in our shared homicide case.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.170
Well, why don't you take
the rest of the day off?

16:37.213 --> 16:38.562
We need the room now.
We got a missing child.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.608
Missing child?
How many hours in?

16:40.651 --> 16:43.132
12 hours, 21 minutes.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.394
How can I help?

16:44.438 --> 16:46.396
Well, since you've
partnered with Fucci,

16:46.440 --> 16:48.050
patience is clearly your forte,

16:48.094 --> 16:50.096
so why don't you keep
the boy's father company?

16:50.139 --> 16:51.445
He might be a flight risk.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.142
Done.FUCCI: Yeah,
Ryan's the man for the job.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.144
He might bore your guy
into a confession.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.451
You know, got to lead
with your strong suit.

16:57.494 --> 17:00.367
And hopefully we will have
some answers by hour 13.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.151
Where are we going?

17:04.110 --> 17:05.937
Dylan, communication.

17:05.981 --> 17:08.592
This is a long shot.

17:08.636 --> 17:11.291
You know how many cases
this judge sees?She's been weighing

17:11.334 --> 17:13.945
this family's battle for months,
she may have other things...

17:13.989 --> 17:15.686
It was canceled.
I called the Alfaros,

17:15.730 --> 17:17.166
but Amanda's too upset to talk.

17:17.210 --> 17:20.256
Will's not picking up...Excuse me.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.345
Are you the Lockhart family
by any chance?

17:22.389 --> 17:23.781
Yes.
We are.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.131
We've been trying to reach you.

17:25.174 --> 17:26.132
I'm Detective Needham.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.742
This is
Dr. Dylan Reinhart, NYPD.

17:27.785 --> 17:29.483
You are
Robby Miller's godparents,

17:29.526 --> 17:30.875
right?

17:30.919 --> 17:33.530
Girls, let's give
Daddy some privacy.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.926
Dear God, what's happened now?

17:40.972 --> 17:43.497
I wish I could say
I'm surprised.

17:43.540 --> 17:45.716
We wanted to be here today
for Robby's sake.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.893
Did you take sides
during the custody case?

17:48.937 --> 17:51.113
We purposely tried not to.

17:51.157 --> 17:53.289
We love having Robby with us
whenever we can help out,

17:53.333 --> 17:56.162
but the poor kid
is so wounded.

17:56.205 --> 17:59.034
Losing his mother,
then his dad in prison.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.993
Constant upheaval.
Not that Robby ever acted out.

18:02.037 --> 18:04.213
My wife and I joke
we wish some of his obedience

18:04.257 --> 18:05.649
would rub off on our girls.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.260
MS. LOCKHART:
I know.

18:07.303 --> 18:08.435
DYLAN: Have you ever
thought that Robby

18:08.478 --> 18:10.393
was in any danger?

18:10.437 --> 18:14.136
We were Mimi's friends;
she's the only one we knew well.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.703
When all this started,

18:15.746 --> 18:18.271
I said no way Will pushed her.

18:18.314 --> 18:20.142
Then, in the trial,
we found out about his temper,

18:20.186 --> 18:22.536
but still, murder?

18:22.579 --> 18:24.799
Then the Alfaros
got so vindictive,

18:24.842 --> 18:26.757
hounding the guy,
bankrupting him.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.585
You think things
could have gotten violent?

18:28.629 --> 18:30.500
Five years

18:30.544 --> 18:32.937
of escalating anger, hatred?
It's gotten toxic.

18:32.981 --> 18:36.071
I think both sides
are capable of anything.

18:37.681 --> 18:40.815
That is exactly what we
were hoping not to hear.

18:47.256 --> 18:50.520
GILLESPIE: It's a tough case,
but all my cases are tough.

18:50.564 --> 18:53.741
Both parties appear to love
Robby, and even when the father

18:53.784 --> 18:56.135
unwisely spirited
his son away,

18:56.178 --> 19:00.661
his behavior toward Robby
was caring and responsible.

19:00.704 --> 19:03.054
You paint a rosy picture,
given what happened last night.

19:03.098 --> 19:06.275
Sounds like you were gonna
decide in favor of the father.

19:06.319 --> 19:07.320
The court prefers to preserve

19:07.363 --> 19:08.756
parental rights
whenever possible.

19:08.799 --> 19:11.759
Could anyone have known
your decision in advance?

19:14.414 --> 19:16.720
That looks like
a yes to me.

19:16.764 --> 19:19.288
I hesitate to add fuel
to a combustible situation.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.290
But even the law agrees
it's okay to yell "fire"

19:21.334 --> 19:22.726
when things are
going up in flames.

19:22.770 --> 19:24.206
What Detective Needham means...What I mean is,

19:24.250 --> 19:26.208
a child's life is
in the balance.

19:26.252 --> 19:30.169
My husband and I belong to the
same golf club as the Alfaros,

19:30.212 --> 19:33.215
and Theo approached
my husband last week.

19:33.259 --> 19:36.218
You're on a first name basis
and you didn't recuse yourself?

19:36.262 --> 19:39.221
I know his name,
he's not a friend.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.571
LIZZIE:
Was Theo trying to influence

19:41.615 --> 19:43.486
your decision?No.

19:43.530 --> 19:46.489
But he did make a subtle attempt
to learn how I might rule.

19:46.533 --> 19:48.709
Naturally, my husband
did not reveal anything.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.319
Didn't you have a duty
to report this?

19:50.363 --> 19:51.538
It wasn't a
criminal case,

19:51.581 --> 19:54.062
and my impartiality
wasn't compromised.

19:54.105 --> 19:57.979
But I did call Mr. Alfaro in
and I reprimanded him.

19:58.022 --> 20:00.024
I was discreet,

20:00.068 --> 20:02.288
but he may well have guessed my
decision would go against him.

20:02.331 --> 20:04.942
Alfaro is a successful man,

20:04.986 --> 20:06.901
uh, he built up his own
construction company,

20:06.944 --> 20:08.642
he's used to getting
his own way.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.818
Was he upset by this?

20:10.861 --> 20:15.779
I'm sure he regrets
speaking out of turn, but...

20:15.823 --> 20:20.001
his parting words to me were "If
you place Robby with his father,

20:20.044 --> 20:22.133
there will be blood
on your hands."

20:22.177 --> 20:25.354
In a criminal case,
that's called a threat.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.791
A threat that
could prove intent.We're gonna need

20:27.835 --> 20:30.751
need a warrant to see if Alfaro
intended to back it up.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.407
Know any judges
who could help us out?

20:38.715 --> 20:40.239
Well, at least we got a warrant.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.849
After I twisted her arm.

20:41.892 --> 20:43.807
ACS judges can be so...

20:43.851 --> 20:45.287
Judgy?

20:45.331 --> 20:47.028
Clueless.

20:47.071 --> 20:49.987
You're not a big fan
of Child Services.

20:50.031 --> 20:53.164
You know I'm gonna
keep on asking.[phone buzzing]

20:53.208 --> 20:55.906
Oh. Babe, I am so sorry.
I forgot all about lunch.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.299
We're on a missing child case.

20:57.343 --> 20:58.561
The one that's
all over the news?

20:58.605 --> 21:00.259
DYLAN: Yeah.Find that kid, will you?

21:00.302 --> 21:02.739
Oh, great, more pressure.
Everything okay?

21:02.783 --> 21:04.524
Eh, nothing life or death.

21:04.567 --> 21:05.829
How about mundane and boring?

21:05.873 --> 21:07.309
I need to take
my blood pressure down.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.572
All right, well, my plan
to launch Sam into

21:09.616 --> 21:11.705
the Rafters managerial
ranks failed.

21:11.748 --> 21:13.184
She gave her notice today.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.056
Sorry to flake on you.
Is that your husband?

21:15.099 --> 21:17.188
Yes, it is.
She is abandoning me

21:17.232 --> 21:19.147
and going back to Sacramento;
you believe that?

21:19.190 --> 21:20.975
Are you that hard
to work for?

21:21.018 --> 21:23.847
Clearly. He's asking, am
I that hard to work for?

21:23.891 --> 21:25.284
I'm just glad
I'm not married to him.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.937
Sorry I never got to meet you.

21:26.981 --> 21:28.939
Well, you know,
I'm sorry you're gonna lose her,

21:28.983 --> 21:30.332
but I know you'll find
a solution.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.334
In fact, that could be
my intro for you:

21:32.378 --> 21:34.467
"Dylan knows Andy will make
a great father

21:34.510 --> 21:36.338
because he never,
ever gives up."

21:36.382 --> 21:39.385
Meh, kinda sounds
like I fail a lot.

21:39.428 --> 21:41.256
Yeah, I-I-I can do better.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.518
I'll talk to you later.

21:42.562 --> 21:45.521
[sighs] You think we'll
surprise the Alfaros?

21:45.565 --> 21:47.480
With a warrant?
That's the point.

21:47.523 --> 21:49.177
Ticktock.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.005
You kind of knew
your way around in there.

21:51.048 --> 21:52.789
You have a lot of cases
with Child Services?

21:52.833 --> 21:54.965
Some.
You met
Judge Gillespie before?

21:55.009 --> 21:56.097
I mean, she didn't
recognize you,

21:56.140 --> 21:58.360
but maybe you've... grown.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.276
It wasn't Gillespie,
but lucky for me

22:01.320 --> 22:03.060
it was another clueless judge.

22:03.104 --> 22:05.628
Lucky for you?

22:05.672 --> 22:07.543
I was 11, my mom was out.

22:07.587 --> 22:08.849
I wasn't supposed
to use the stove,

22:08.892 --> 22:10.372
but Katie was desperate
for a hot dog.

22:10.416 --> 22:11.895
Dish towel caught on fire.

22:11.939 --> 22:13.244
A nosy neighbor got
my mom served.

22:13.288 --> 22:14.898
And the judge didn't help?

22:14.942 --> 22:16.770
It was my problem.
I fixed it.

22:20.513 --> 22:22.776
Careful with that, please.

22:22.819 --> 22:24.778
What are you even looking for?

22:24.821 --> 22:26.214
Okay, enough.
This is overreach.

22:26.257 --> 22:27.389
I'm calling my lawyer.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.869
Before you do,

22:28.912 --> 22:30.087
found these in the study.

22:30.131 --> 22:32.176
You planning a trip today?

22:32.220 --> 22:34.396
No, we had a court date.And yet you booked

22:34.440 --> 22:36.137
three tickets to Havana
for this evening,

22:36.180 --> 22:37.399
and here's Robby's passport.

22:37.443 --> 22:40.141
I told you to cancel that.

22:41.751 --> 22:43.013
You know,
Cuba is a country

22:43.057 --> 22:45.059
with no extradition treaty
with the U.S.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.887
Oh, no, it wasn't my--

22:46.930 --> 22:49.368
I grew up there.
I showed Robby

22:49.411 --> 22:50.891
the old photos.

22:50.934 --> 22:52.066
It was his mother's
heritage.

22:52.109 --> 22:54.460
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

22:54.503 --> 22:55.983
Excuse me, Mr. Alfaro,

22:56.026 --> 22:57.898
is that your company van
in the driveway?

22:57.941 --> 23:00.074
Yeah. Some of my work crew
have been stopping by,

23:00.117 --> 23:01.118
worried about Robby. Why?

23:01.162 --> 23:03.164
We just found blood in the back.

23:03.207 --> 23:04.905
A fair amount.Oh, no.

23:04.948 --> 23:06.167
Is there anything

23:06.210 --> 23:07.690
either of you would
like to tell us?

23:07.734 --> 23:09.475
It's a construction van.

23:09.518 --> 23:10.998
Guys get injured on the job.

23:11.041 --> 23:12.434
You both love Robby.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.175
If only you could
get him to Cuba.

23:14.218 --> 23:16.177
You knew the judge was
gonna rule against you.

23:16.220 --> 23:17.570
You were desperate.
You were gonna lose a grandson.She was?

23:17.613 --> 23:19.180
Maybe you acted with
the best of intentions...

23:19.223 --> 23:21.530
Theo, what did you do?

23:23.314 --> 23:25.229
I want my lawyer.

23:35.196 --> 23:36.327
Mimi sounds special.

23:36.371 --> 23:37.894
I can see why
she caught your eye.

23:37.938 --> 23:40.462
Yeah, she was just becoming
a fantastic mother.

23:47.251 --> 23:48.644
You'll need to find
another spot.

23:48.688 --> 23:49.819
We're bringing in
the grandfather.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.821
Thanks.

23:51.865 --> 23:54.084
Sorry to interrupt.
Uh, we can't waste time

23:54.128 --> 23:56.217
on security upgrades
or whatever you're doing.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.871
We need all hands on deck
for the missing kid.

23:57.914 --> 23:59.873
Actually, Jules just
reprogrammed the database

23:59.916 --> 24:01.483
to link license plates
of known predators

24:01.527 --> 24:03.398
with traffic surveillance.
Saved me five hours.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.182
If that's okay.

24:05.226 --> 24:08.490
Yes. Thank you, Jules.
That's very helpful.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.013
FUCCI:
Finally a break, folks.

24:10.057 --> 24:12.059
Blood in the water
and in Grandpa's van,

24:12.102 --> 24:13.887
it matches the kid's.

24:13.930 --> 24:17.978
Blood?
Robby's blood?

24:18.021 --> 24:19.022
What did you do to my son?

24:19.066 --> 24:20.676
WOMAN:
Look out.

24:21.721 --> 24:24.114
[grunting]

24:30.947 --> 24:33.646
You play safety
in high school?

24:33.689 --> 24:36.866
Uh, and wide receiver.
And the water boy.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.738
It was a small school.

24:44.787 --> 24:46.833
RYAN: Sure you don't want
some ice on that?

24:46.876 --> 24:49.096
WILL:
You clobbered me pretty good.

24:49.139 --> 24:51.054
RYAN: Let's go back to the day
that Mimi died.

24:51.098 --> 24:53.100
WILL: You want to talk
about five years ago?

24:53.143 --> 24:54.623
RYAN:
You got something better to do?

24:54.667 --> 24:56.146
LIZZIE:
Shouldn't you be in there?

24:56.190 --> 24:57.278
I gave Ryan my questions.

24:57.321 --> 24:59.236
I want to observe.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.629
What news of Grandpa?

25:00.673 --> 25:02.805
Uh, still not talking.
Waiting for his lawyer,

25:02.849 --> 25:05.068
who's taking his sweet time.

25:05.112 --> 25:07.680
We had a fight on the terrace,
and I stormed out.

25:07.723 --> 25:09.551
I went to the...HARRIS: Went to the park
where I used to score.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.640
You got to hand it to this guy.

25:11.684 --> 25:15.165
Once he found a story that
worked, he really stuck to it.

25:15.209 --> 25:17.646
WILL:
But my dealer didn't show.

25:18.734 --> 25:21.258
If I'd gone straight to pick up
Robby, like a good dad...

25:21.302 --> 25:22.999
Hey, you want to take a crack
at any of these drivers

25:23.043 --> 25:24.697
who worked at Alfaro's company?

25:26.612 --> 25:28.309
That guy.

25:31.181 --> 25:32.618
He was at the crime scene
this morning.

25:42.715 --> 25:45.587
Yeah, I was there.
I saw the crowd.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.546
I knew that was where
Mr. A's grandson lived.

25:47.589 --> 25:48.982
So, you know Robby?

25:49.025 --> 25:51.941
A lot of the crew does.Ever pick him up?

25:51.985 --> 25:54.901
A few times.
I've worked with Alfaro

25:54.944 --> 25:56.424
since before Robby was born.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.557
So Robby has been
in a company vehicle with you.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.949
You ever let him
pretend to drive?

25:59.993 --> 26:01.908
Maybe.

26:01.951 --> 26:03.997
Maybe?

26:04.040 --> 26:05.607
Kids like trucks.
Wha-What are you getting at?

26:05.651 --> 26:07.740
What he's getting at is,
a boy went missing last night

26:07.783 --> 26:10.133
two blocks from where
your van was parked.

26:10.177 --> 26:11.918
We were doing a job there.

26:11.961 --> 26:13.093
I've been driving back and forth

26:13.136 --> 26:14.660
from the Rockaways office
all summer.

26:14.703 --> 26:15.878
When was the last time
you saw Robby?

26:15.922 --> 26:17.793
It's been months.

26:17.837 --> 26:19.403
What about the company picnic?

26:19.447 --> 26:21.623
Well, I forgot about that.Oh.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.059
There were a lot of kids there.

26:23.103 --> 26:24.974
Did you play with all the kids
or just with Robby?

26:25.018 --> 26:27.934
He's the boss's grandson.
I made nice.

26:27.977 --> 26:30.023
The boss ever ask you
to help him out,

26:30.066 --> 26:31.198
do a favor outside of work?

26:31.241 --> 26:33.374
Sure. I don't want
to lose my job.

26:33.417 --> 26:34.984
So, if Alfaro asked you
to give the kid a ride,

26:35.028 --> 26:36.290
maybe offer to pay you
under the table...

26:36.333 --> 26:37.465
You don't have any children,

26:37.508 --> 26:38.727
do you, Mr. Henderson?
You live alone?

26:38.771 --> 26:41.600
Yeah, since my mother died.
Am I under arrest?

26:42.818 --> 26:45.429
LIZZIE:
This is a surveillance video

26:45.473 --> 26:47.301
of the suspect's van.

26:47.344 --> 26:50.434
Unfortunately, you can't see
the back door from this angle.

26:50.478 --> 26:52.741
JASMINE: But there he is.
And the time frame lines up

26:52.785 --> 26:54.264
with the boy's disappearance.

26:54.308 --> 26:57.877
Exactly. And here's his trip
to the Rockaways offices.

27:01.271 --> 27:04.318
Whoa. How are you
showing me all this?

27:04.361 --> 27:06.625
ZACK:
Jules spliced together CCTV

27:06.668 --> 27:09.279
and private security cameras
to give us a multi-cam mosaic

27:09.323 --> 27:12.413
of the van's trip last night.

27:12.456 --> 27:14.763
JASMINE: Our tech guy's more
than just a pretty face.

27:14.807 --> 27:17.331
Uh, Henderson went
straight to the Rockaways.

27:17.374 --> 27:20.203
Unfortunately...
[clicks tongue]

27:22.597 --> 27:23.511
JASMINE:
Are you kidding me?

27:23.554 --> 27:25.339
So the driver left?

27:25.382 --> 27:28.124
Wait. Zack, can you
fast-forward?

27:33.390 --> 27:34.653
JASMINE:
What's he up to?

27:34.696 --> 27:36.306
Claims he forgot his phone.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.482
He's being printed
right now.

27:39.483 --> 27:41.355
You know, I'm curious
about how your memory changed

27:41.398 --> 27:42.617
on the day that Mimi died.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.271
Why you didn't mention
looking for your dealer

27:44.314 --> 27:45.881
the first time
you talked to the cops.

27:45.925 --> 27:48.318
I would kind of go on autopilot
when I was triggered to use.

27:48.362 --> 27:52.322
I'd just find myself
in front of my dealer.

27:52.366 --> 27:55.282
And then I heard Mimi was dead,
and I was just...

27:55.325 --> 27:57.284
[sighs]

27:57.327 --> 27:59.329
I shouldn't have left her alone.

28:01.157 --> 28:03.638
Uh, how-how late did you
show up to the sitter's?

28:03.682 --> 28:05.161
About an hour.

28:05.205 --> 28:08.556
Um, the other kids
that she watched had left.

28:08.599 --> 28:10.732
And then the wind picks up,
and there's no sustained view

28:10.776 --> 28:11.907
of the van for seven minutes.

28:11.951 --> 28:14.083
More than enough time

28:14.127 --> 28:15.737
for the driver
to take the body out.

28:15.781 --> 28:18.261
Can we just not
say "body" just yet?

28:18.305 --> 28:19.828
RYAN: Wait a minute,
wait a minute, break that down.

28:19.872 --> 28:21.569
You got
to the babysitter's house,

28:21.612 --> 28:24.006
you put Robby's
jacket on, then what?

28:24.050 --> 28:26.095
I-I don't-- Robby was wriggling,

28:26.139 --> 28:27.706
and I was trying to pay
the sitter,

28:27.749 --> 28:31.492
so I raised my voice, which
they used against me at trial.

28:31.535 --> 28:34.234
Go back.
You paid the babysitter?

28:36.453 --> 28:37.628
How much?

28:37.672 --> 28:40.936
Cash or check?
I don't know.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.633
She only took cash.
Who cares?

28:42.677 --> 28:44.200
You had cash?

28:44.244 --> 28:46.768
I must have.You were thinking about
getting drugs, right?

28:46.812 --> 28:48.901
Did you need to get cash?Maybe. I don't know.

28:48.944 --> 28:51.120
Look, I've been through
this a million times.

28:51.164 --> 28:53.514
Could he really have
forgotten this?

28:53.557 --> 28:56.125
Addicts who are craving often
go into a dissociative state.

28:56.169 --> 28:59.041
They literally cannot retrace
their steps afterwards.

28:59.085 --> 29:00.042
RYAN:
If you did get cash,

29:00.086 --> 29:01.261
where would you have
gotten it?

29:01.304 --> 29:03.785
The ATM at 68th and Third.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.918
LIZZIE: That could prove
he didn't kill his wife.

29:05.961 --> 29:06.962
We need to get those
bank records.

29:07.006 --> 29:07.963
Any withdrawal
would be time-stamped.

29:08.007 --> 29:09.269
It could prove his alibi.

29:09.312 --> 29:11.097
And break the habit
of accusations

29:11.140 --> 29:13.360
and guilt that have smothered
this family for years.

29:13.403 --> 29:15.405
[indistinct chatter]

29:17.581 --> 29:18.800
I'm gonna see if I can
pull up those bank records.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.802
