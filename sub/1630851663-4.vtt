Narrator:
Tonight, Silicon Valley veteran
Nirav Tolia joins the Tank.

00:09.143 --> 00:12.546
Nirav is the founder of social
media phenomenon Nextdoor.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.515
I've been the CEO
of three different companies

00:14.548 --> 00:15.516
in Silicon Valley.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.485
I know how to bring it
to the masses.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.887
We have created
the world's first

00:19.920 --> 00:21.622
custom-fitted
swimming goggles.

00:21.655 --> 00:22.956
All of our products
are inspired

00:22.990 --> 00:24.925
by traditional
Moroccan hammam spas.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.327
Whoo!
Whoo!

00:26.360 --> 00:28.396
It can save
1 out of 3 children

00:28.429 --> 00:30.598
from catching the most
deadly diseases.

00:30.631 --> 00:33.167
Why has nobody ever
thought of this?
'Cause <i>they</i> did.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.702
When you have
a new category,

00:34.735 --> 00:36.104
it's not where you are,
it's where you'll be.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.671
I think what
you're building here

00:37.705 --> 00:40.108
is not just a company,
I think it is a movement.

00:43.111 --> 00:45.746
**

00:45.779 --> 00:48.549
Good luck, Nirav.
Thanks for having me, guys.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.551
Oh, you won't say that
in about two hours.

00:50.584 --> 00:51.585
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: Yeah, right.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.187
We shall see.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.789
**

00:55.823 --> 00:58.159
Narrator: First in the Tank
is a new innovation

00:58.192 --> 01:00.494
in the fitness accessory space.

01:00.528 --> 01:09.470
**

01:09.503 --> 01:11.205
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Rasmus.

01:11.239 --> 01:14.108
And I'm Bo.
We're from TheMagic5.

01:14.142 --> 01:17.111
We all know Sharks have
excellent vision underwater,

01:17.145 --> 01:19.380
but it's not easy
for everyone else

01:19.413 --> 01:21.682
and that is why
we wear swimming goggles.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.384
But most
swimming goggles today

01:23.417 --> 01:25.519
either leak
or are uncomfortable,

01:25.553 --> 01:26.654
and it makes total sense.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.055
Of course they do.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.957
All of our faces
are different.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.025
Swimming goggles
are one-size-fits-all.

01:32.059 --> 01:35.529
And that is why we have
created the world's first

01:35.563 --> 01:37.665
custom-fitted
swimming goggles.
Wow.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.601
It only takes 13 seconds
to scan your face,

01:40.634 --> 01:43.671
and we'll deliver the goggles
directly to your doorstep.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.174
Our app-based
scanning technology

01:46.207 --> 01:49.042
ensures a perfectly
fitting goggle

01:49.076 --> 01:52.213
with no leakage
and no marks after use.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.915
Some of the world's
very best swimmers

01:54.948 --> 01:58.419
and triathletes,
they already wear our goggles.

01:58.452 --> 02:02.223
But we want all swimmers
to get a pair of our goggles.

02:02.256 --> 02:06.059
And to accomplish that,
we're seeking $500,000

02:06.093 --> 02:07.761
for 2 1/2%
of our company.
[ Laughter ]

02:07.795 --> 02:08.862
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.030
Hello. Wow.

02:10.063 --> 02:13.000
So, Sharks, who wants
to help create magic?

02:14.034 --> 02:17.070
Sharks, in front of you,
you have two goggles.

02:17.104 --> 02:19.407
You can try them on,
but they won't fit you

02:19.440 --> 02:21.008
because you haven't
scanned your face,

02:21.041 --> 02:22.343
so we haven't been able
to produce a pair

02:22.376 --> 02:23.411
of goggles for you.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.912
Have a look at
the part of the goggle

02:24.945 --> 02:26.180
that touches your face.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.449
You can see
that gasket is different

02:28.482 --> 02:29.983
from the two goggles
that you have,

02:30.017 --> 02:32.520
and that is really
our secret sauce.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.422
And what do they sell for?
$55.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.756
They're very dark.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.057
That is for
outdoor swimming.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.727
So, we have, like, ranges
from super light one --

02:39.760 --> 02:41.329
totally clear --
to very, very dark.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.130
And the design
of the goggle

02:43.163 --> 02:44.965
means that you have
a great peripheral view,

02:44.998 --> 02:47.601
which is super useful
so you can navigate better.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.403
How big
is the goggle market?

02:49.437 --> 02:51.605
In the U.S. and Europe,
$2.2 billion.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.307
Cuban: Wait, how much?
$2.2 billion?

02:53.341 --> 02:55.909
I'm not surprised.
I'm not surprised.
No, there's cha--
In the U.S.?

02:55.943 --> 02:58.779
I have three young sons.
They were goggles.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.514
All of their friends
wear goggles.

03:00.548 --> 03:03.384
But for a $20 million
valuation,

03:03.417 --> 03:05.353
I'm guessing you've already
sold a lot of these.

03:05.386 --> 03:08.289
Yeah, so, we have
40,000 customers so far.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.424
Our lifetime revenue
is $3 million.

03:10.458 --> 03:11.425
When did you start?

03:11.459 --> 03:13.761
We started it in 2018,

03:13.794 --> 03:16.597
and we have been growing
like three times every year.

03:16.630 --> 03:17.965
It's so logical.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.767
I mean, my glasses
are made for me.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.537
Why have swimming goggles
never been custom-made?

03:23.571 --> 03:26.139
So, we are a triathlete,
both of us.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.775
I went on a vacation.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.743
I forgot my goggles,
but I had to swim.

03:29.777 --> 03:33.281
And then I purchased all
the goggles that I could find.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.715
None of them fit me.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.584
Then, I called
the best triathlete

03:36.617 --> 03:37.785
that I knew at the time.

03:37.818 --> 03:38.986
That was Rasmus,
my nephew.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.289
Oh, he's your nephew?
Yes.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.591
Where are you from?
We're from Denmark.

03:43.624 --> 03:44.792
Oh!

03:44.825 --> 03:47.528
I don't understand why
you're only charging $55.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.062
Why aren't these $99?

03:49.096 --> 03:50.898
So, we wanted to charge

03:50.931 --> 03:54.368
in the middle of the other
high-end goggles, right?

03:54.402 --> 03:57.971
We didn't want price to be
an issue for our customers.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.172
What does it cost
to make it?

03:59.206 --> 04:00.741
It costs $14.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.411
Okay, and what is the customer
acquisition cost?

04:03.444 --> 04:05.112
That is $24.

04:05.145 --> 04:07.515
Okay, so, guys,
nobody comes in here

04:07.548 --> 04:11.251
asking for $500,000
for 2 1/2%.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.887
That's always to protect
your previous investors.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.056
So tell us, how much money
have you raised?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.825
We have raised
$1.5 million.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.226
At what valuation?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.194
The last valuation
that we had

04:21.228 --> 04:22.430
was $9 million.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.598
Can you walk us through
how the ramp has gone

04:24.632 --> 04:26.667
over, let's say,
the last three years?

04:26.700 --> 04:30.003
In 2018, when we delivered
the first goggles,

04:30.037 --> 04:31.539
our revenue was $180,000.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.807
The year after,
it was $370,000.

04:33.841 --> 04:36.243
Last year, it was
$1.2 million.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.413
Wow.
And so far, this year,
we're at $1.5 million.

04:39.447 --> 04:40.481
Impressive.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.949
So, where are you based,

04:41.982 --> 04:43.917
and where do you
manufacture?

04:43.951 --> 04:46.620
So, I moved to Charlotte,
and Rasmus moved to New York.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.756
Barfred: So we basically
convinced our wives

04:48.789 --> 04:51.191
to make the bet
and move to the U.S.
[ Laughs ]

04:51.224 --> 04:53.193
Why did you choose
to move to the U.S.?

04:53.226 --> 04:55.095
The market here
is better...
[ Indistinct whispering ]

04:55.128 --> 04:57.030
...and the relative
number of swimmers

04:57.064 --> 04:58.599
is slightly higher
than Europe.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.368
So, then,
your manufacturing...

05:00.401 --> 05:01.435
Yeah.
...where is that done?

05:01.469 --> 05:03.371
So, we get some
of our parts from China,

05:03.404 --> 05:05.373
and then all the
customization happens

05:05.406 --> 05:06.940
in Charlotte,
North Carolina.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.942
Do you have any type
of IP coverage?

05:08.976 --> 05:12.346
We have a utility patent
on the fitting algorithm.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.281
Cuban: So, you
manufacture the goggles,

05:14.314 --> 05:16.316
and you have to
customize them to fit.

05:16.350 --> 05:17.751
What is that process like?

05:17.785 --> 05:20.954
Yeah, so we used advanced
robotics technology to do it.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.456
Are you using
third-party robotics,

05:22.490 --> 05:23.757
or are you developing it
all yourself?

05:23.791 --> 05:25.426
So, all the software
to control the robot

05:25.459 --> 05:26.860
is, of course,
made by us.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.829
Not all companies
can make robotics, right?

05:28.862 --> 05:30.931
Mark, it's a goggle company,
not a robotics company.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.300
No, it's a robotics company
that makes goggles right now.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.635
That's exactly right.
Exactly.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.069
Look, when you have
a unique niche

05:36.103 --> 05:38.372
and you're developing
a new category,

05:38.406 --> 05:40.474
it's not where you are,
it's where you'll be.

05:40.508 --> 05:44.244
I'll offer you the $500,000,
but I want 7 1/2%.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.214
And I don't want you
to negotiate with everybody,

05:47.247 --> 05:48.849
'cause you already know that
they're flipping them out.
Well, wait a second, Mark.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.183
There may be other offers.
Greiner: He's putting
the clock on you.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.985
That means he doesn't want you
to hear anything else.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.455
If you're more concerned
about that equity,

05:54.488 --> 05:55.523
the two of us have an offer

05:55.556 --> 05:57.758
you may find
very interesting, okay?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.960
Guys, I already have
a robotics company

05:59.993 --> 06:00.961
that I'm an investor in.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.362
I have AI companies.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.864
I have machine learning
companies.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.298
I have AR companies.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.334
And, obviously, being
in the sports industry,

06:07.367 --> 06:09.236
I have a platform.
But you may not
want to give up 7 1/2%.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.804
Well, that's why,
if that's too much,

06:10.838 --> 06:12.506
then I'll listen
to a counter.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.676
Just so you have it,
Let me give you an offer

06:15.709 --> 06:17.144
that two Sharks want
to give you, okay?

06:17.177 --> 06:19.747
And you can get both
the sales and the technology.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.649
So, how about this deal?

06:21.682 --> 06:22.816
Venture debt deal.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.719
$500,000, all right,
between the two of us,

06:25.753 --> 06:27.855
and we're going to
charge you $3 a unit

06:27.888 --> 06:29.490
until we recoup $1.5 million.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.492
Then the royalty goes away.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.727
But we're only gonna ask
for 5% equity.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.564
And you get two Sharks.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.666
Herjavec: Or, Rasmus,
let me tell you.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.301
So, my daughter was
a world-class swimmer.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.737
In fact, she was ranked
in the top 10 in the world

06:43.771 --> 06:46.006
in the butterfly
when she was 12 years old.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.910
I've spent 18 years
at swimming pools.
[ Laughter ]

06:49.943 --> 06:51.211
I get this market.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.915
I'll do $500,000 for 5%,
no royalty.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.751
I just want to say,
what you need are partners.

06:57.785 --> 07:01.088
So with Mr. Wonderful,
you know what you're gonna get.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.122
Nothing.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.090
Nothing.
Exactly.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.257
Greiner: Right?

07:04.291 --> 07:06.093
Nothing except for
what will help you

07:06.126 --> 07:07.260
scale your business.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.229
I've been the CEO
of three different companies

07:09.262 --> 07:10.498
in Silicon Valley.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.501
I know how to build
extremely large audiences

07:13.534 --> 07:14.635
cost-effectively.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.069
You have
an amazing product.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.806
But now, how are we gonna
bring it to the masses?

07:18.839 --> 07:20.608
That's the kind of problem
that I've solved

over the last 20 years.

that 5%?

Guys, we'll drop down 1%
just to be more competitive.

we'll go to 4%.

We want that royalty
structure in place,

09:08.081 --> 09:09.482

that great a return,

09:11.685 --> 09:12.786

No, we're only making
a million bucks off $500,000.

a tremendous amount of it

09:45.886 --> 09:47.120

a little more equity.

to dream as big as possible.

that what I loved to do
was build things.

an amazing school,

12:13.300 --> 12:14.367

12:14.401 --> 12:17.037

of the Internet.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.772
All around me,
these companies were starting.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.474

Yahoo!

12:23.410 --> 12:25.245

winning the lottery.

I was at a place
that was the center

12:27.380 --> 12:30.851
of the first Internet boom,
and it taught me to dream.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.053
It made me want to be
an entrepreneur

12:33.086 --> 12:35.588
and to build my own company.

12:35.622 --> 12:39.192
In 1999, I left Yahoo!
and started Epinions.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.228
Ultimately, the company
was purchased by eBay

12:41.261 --> 12:43.763

12:43.797 --> 12:45.398
In the summer of 2008,

that we wouldn't quit,

13:03.716 --> 13:04.885

of social networks --

13:08.388 --> 13:10.257
Facebook to communicate
with friends,

13:10.290 --> 13:11.925
LinkedIn to connect
with our colleagues.

being formed online

13:14.494 --> 13:16.229
for the community
in which we live.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.298

of Nextdoor.

at one of the cat
conventions...

16:49.642 --> 16:51.078
[ Laughs ]
...and we kind of
hit it off.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.979
I go by
Sterling "TrapKing" Davis --

16:53.012 --> 16:55.882
TrapKing, named after
my cat rescue nonprofit.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.250
I am one of one.

16:57.284 --> 16:58.685
Cat rescue is usually
something done by

16:58.718 --> 17:00.053
middle-aged white women.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.222
I am the only Black man
that you will see...
[ Laughter ]

17:02.255 --> 17:04.991
...that sold everything
and lives out of his vehicle

17:05.024 --> 17:06.226
and rescue cats.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.460
- Good for you.
- Good for you.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.262
How many cat owners are there
in the first place?

17:09.296 --> 17:10.397
Great question.

17:10.430 --> 17:13.500
17 million single cat owners
in the U.S.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.235
A lot of people don't know
how many cat people

17:15.268 --> 17:16.869
are actually out there
'cause most of us

17:16.903 --> 17:18.305
are ashamed to come out
with it.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.606
I'm a cat lover.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.409
I do not understand why
there is cat shame at all.

17:22.442 --> 17:23.843
Why is there cat shame?
[ Laughs ]

17:23.876 --> 17:25.011
I have no idea.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.214
'Cause it's not cool,
Lori!

17:27.247 --> 17:29.682
Oh, that is so not right.
You're not gonna walk
your cat down the street.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.751
Cats are so cool.
Okay, okay. Can you give me
some statistics?

17:31.784 --> 17:34.254
There is no animal
cooler than a lion.
When did you get started?

17:34.287 --> 17:36.089
How many people
are using the app?

17:36.123 --> 17:37.557
What have you learned
so far?

17:37.590 --> 17:41.294
So, last summer, we had
the opportunity to launch Tabby

17:41.328 --> 17:43.696
because we won the
Million Dollar Dating Project.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.099
What is that?
It is a grant

17:46.133 --> 17:48.468
from a dating
platform company,

17:48.501 --> 17:52.105
and they gave us $50,000
in equity-free grant money

17:52.139 --> 17:54.040
to be able
to market the platform.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.775
And we could use
their platform,

17:55.808 --> 17:57.810
put our branding on it,
then market from there.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.812
We launched on
International Cat Day

17:59.846 --> 18:02.215
on this pre-made platform.
Of course you did.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.616
When we launched,

18:03.650 --> 18:07.019
there were a massive amount
of problems on the platform.

18:07.053 --> 18:09.489
Oh, good.
I hate when
that happens!

18:09.522 --> 18:11.391
Yes, when we
first launched,

18:11.424 --> 18:13.793
that platform had
all of the development made.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.027
We brought our branding.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.397
They built something
that was built to the web

18:17.430 --> 18:20.099
and wasn't exactly made
for mobile.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.369
And it's -- You know,
we went into it --

18:22.402 --> 18:23.570
Okay, you gave us
the excuses.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.405
Now get to the numbers.
Okay, sure.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.640
We had 31,000 users
on the app.

18:27.674 --> 18:30.377
We made $43,000
in revenue.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.612
$17,000 of that
was from subscriptions,

18:32.645 --> 18:34.046
and $25,000 of that

18:34.080 --> 18:36.383
was from our first
integration partner.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.551
And then, since then,
we've not been marketing,

18:38.585 --> 18:41.521
as we've been building out
the next version of Tabby.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.823
And are you still
on their platform?

18:43.856 --> 18:46.293
What I wanted to do
was come to you guys today

18:46.326 --> 18:49.095
and tell you we want to switch
to a new platform.

18:49.128 --> 18:53.733
That urgency
increased entirely

18:53.766 --> 18:55.335
in the past few days

18:55.368 --> 18:57.136
when they terminated
our contract early.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.938
Ooh!
O'Leary: Oh, good!

18:58.971 --> 19:00.907
It is hitting the fan!
It just gets better!

19:00.940 --> 19:03.676
Wow.
Since then -- because of
all the issues, especially --

19:03.710 --> 19:05.745
we went out, and we sourced
the best team.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.715
We built an entirely new app
with our new development team.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.850
Okay, well, that's great, but
when are you ready to release?

19:10.883 --> 19:13.186
It's already under review
by Apple right now.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.654
So it should be
whenever they're done...
Got it.
So you're ready to pop out.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.556
...in the next two weeks.
Is it a monthly
subscription?

19:16.589 --> 19:18.425
Yes, it's $19.99 a month.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.060
Oh, that's expensive!
$19.99?

19:21.093 --> 19:22.795
It seems like a lot.
Well, is that
expensive, or not?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.264
In the dating industry
right now,

19:24.297 --> 19:25.765
that's not
extraordinarily expensive.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.099
But for a startup,
it's expensive.
That's pretty average

19:27.133 --> 19:29.302
for regular
premium subscriptions.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.971
How much money have you raised
to this point?

19:32.004 --> 19:34.341
For Tabby, we've raised no money
other than the equity grant.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.142
See, to me,
that's the problem, right?

19:36.175 --> 19:38.077
Because you had
to funnel everything

19:38.110 --> 19:41.147
and do everything
on this other platform

19:41.180 --> 19:43.115
for $50,000.

19:43.149 --> 19:45.618
That's impossible.
And now here you are scrambling.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.620
As Nirav will tell you,
and all of us will tell you,

19:47.654 --> 19:50.357
growing an app
is difficult, competitive,

19:50.390 --> 19:51.958
and really expensive

19:51.991 --> 19:54.227
unless you just find
a unique niche.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.663
You know, and maybe you guys
can make it take off virally,

19:56.696 --> 19:58.030
but it's really,
really hard.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.766
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.069
Look, I wish you
all the best.
Thank you.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.137
Any time you can
connect people and animals

20:05.171 --> 20:06.673
and create more love
in the world...

20:06.706 --> 20:08.140
Good.
...it's a wonderful thing.

20:08.174 --> 20:09.609
But it's not for me.
I'm out.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.411

Understandable.

20:11.444 --> 20:14.714
What we have right now
is the car,

20:14.747 --> 20:17.517
the keys, the map,
the drivers.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.819
We need the rocket fuel
to be able to take off, right?
But you got no gas.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.754
You got no gas, and you got
no money for gas.

some money for gas.

the passion.

20:26.293 --> 20:28.895

from starting Nextdoor

20:28.928 --> 20:31.964
and growing it to over
50 million registered users,

20:31.998 --> 20:35.368
it's very, very difficult
to get distribution.

20:35.402 --> 20:38.037
You need to find a way
to break through the noise

20:38.070 --> 20:39.839
of all those
existing dating apps

20:39.872 --> 20:41.408
and make a name
for yourself.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.643
I think you probably have
a long way to go

20:43.676 --> 20:45.945
to really build
a breakthrough tech app,

20:45.978 --> 20:47.347

I'm out.

this way.

called Basepaws

20:54.120 --> 20:55.855
at a $2 million valuation.

at a $40 million valuation now,

20:58.958 --> 21:01.961
and she has built
a huge database of cat owners.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.464
We may have the largest
cat database in America,

21:04.497 --> 21:08.968
and I have become a cat lover
because it has cash flow.

wash your hands?

Yes.
But did you use soap?

We all know
these are questions

parents have to ask
multiple times a day.

Let's face it --
kids don't like

24:11.551 --> 24:13.520
stopping what they're doing
to wash their hands,

24:13.553 --> 24:16.055
and when they do,
they don't wash properly

24:16.088 --> 24:18.157
or for the right
amount of time.

24:18.190 --> 24:21.060

on everything --

24:21.093 --> 24:24.831
tables, walls,
and even on their own bodies.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.866
We put these
two problems together

24:28.668 --> 24:30.369
- SoaPen!

25:19.786 --> 25:20.853
[ Laughter ]

25:20.887 --> 25:23.089
Issar: We're using
food-grade colorants,

25:23.122 --> 25:25.457
and we are sulfate-free,
phthalate free,

25:25.491 --> 25:26.593
coconut-derived.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.695
So it is a very gentle
and mild formula.

25:28.728 --> 25:29.829
Greiner: It's pretty cool.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.530
Mine smells, I think,
like blueberry.

25:31.564 --> 25:32.799
Yep, Berry Blast.
Yeah.

25:32.832 --> 25:36.035
So, you know, it's smart
to put a fragrance to it,

25:36.068 --> 25:37.203
'cause kids love that.
Yeah.

25:37.236 --> 25:38.571
Tolia:
It's a beautiful product.

25:38.605 --> 25:41.841
It's really beautiful,
and it's a really neat idea.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.843
How did you guys
come up with this?

25:43.876 --> 25:45.612
So, Amanat and I
grew up in India.

25:45.645 --> 25:48.280
At 17, we moved
to the United States

25:48.314 --> 25:49.616
to study industrial design

25:49.649 --> 25:51.350
at the Parsons School of Design
in New York.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.385
Wow.
We loved
working together

25:53.419 --> 25:56.322
while we were in college,
and we wanted to make sure

25:56.355 --> 25:58.357
that we're using
our skills for good.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.027
And we came across the UNICEF
Wearables for Good Challenge,

26:01.060 --> 26:02.862
which highlighted
horrible statistics

26:02.895 --> 26:04.163
around infant mortality

26:04.196 --> 26:06.766
and how a ton of these
diseases can be avoided

26:06.799 --> 26:08.701
by just washing
your hands with soap.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.770
And that's how we came up
with the idea of SoaPen.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.138
We went on
to win the challenge

26:12.171 --> 26:14.440
and use the prize money
to start R&D

26:14.473 --> 26:15.675
and make SoaPen
a reality.

26:15.708 --> 26:16.843
Congratulations.
Wow.
Wow.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.310
Thank you.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.046
So, tell me,
what are your sales?

26:20.079 --> 26:23.716
So, in lifetime,
we've done $85,000 in sales.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.786
We launched a beta version
of SoaPen in 2019.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.755
At the time, we hadn't
raised any funding

26:28.788 --> 26:30.957
and had
no marketing budget,

26:30.990 --> 26:33.325
so we were definitely
very lost.

26:33.359 --> 26:35.728
But we got an article
in <i>Real Simple</i> magazine

26:35.762 --> 26:37.496
in October of 2019,

26:37.529 --> 26:41.067
and we had no idea what
the power of print media is.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.736
We sold out of our entire
inventory in three weeks.

26:43.770 --> 26:44.804
Which was how many?

26:44.837 --> 26:47.273
It was 5,000 units...
That were left over.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.676
...that we sold out
in three weeks.

26:49.709 --> 26:50.910
So, you had that print.
Yes.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.111
You got a blip in sales.
Yeah.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.479
Are you still selling it?

26:53.512 --> 26:55.481
So, that really validated
the demand for the product,

26:55.514 --> 26:58.017
which was not something
we were sure of early on.
Right.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.418
And then it gave us
the confidence

26:59.451 --> 27:00.619
to go out there, fundraise.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.689
And we got a ton
of product feedback

27:02.722 --> 27:04.390
from that first
beta version.

27:04.423 --> 27:06.158
And then we took that money
that we raised to go back --

27:06.192 --> 27:07.426
How much did you raise?

27:07.459 --> 27:09.628
So, we raised $225,000...

27:09.662 --> 27:11.197
Greiner: Wow.
...at a $1 million
valuation.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.199
We just closed it.
That's a lot.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.902
All right, what does it cost,
and what is your cost?

27:15.935 --> 27:19.038
So, it's $14.99
for a pack of three.

27:19.071 --> 27:22.408
Anand: Manufacturing a single
pack of three is $4.30.

27:22.441 --> 27:26.278
Our blended profit margin across
all channels is 40%.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.579
Cuban:
How are you selling it?

27:27.613 --> 27:30.082
What are you doing to market
and sell your product?

27:30.116 --> 27:32.251
So, we've been
running ads on Amazon.

27:32.284 --> 27:33.753
Right now, it's only been
two months,

27:33.786 --> 27:36.255
so it's very hard to tell.
What's your return
on ad spend?

27:36.288 --> 27:38.457
It's -- We're still
determining that.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.792
It's been two months,

27:39.826 --> 27:42.228
so we don't have
a good number yet.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.663
Well, that means it's not good
and you don't want to tell me.

27:44.697 --> 27:46.598
We're overspending --
Because two months
is enough time.

27:46.632 --> 27:48.000
One day is enough time.
I know.

27:48.034 --> 27:50.402
You have to make sure you're
getting that return on ad spend.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.004
Otherwise, that money
disappears like that,

27:52.038 --> 27:54.673
particularly with
the categories you're in.
Yeah.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.575
O'Leary: And let me point
something out, okay?

27:56.608 --> 27:58.677
A product like this --
which has merit, okay?

27:58.711 --> 28:00.947
I'm gonna give you a
lot of credit for what
you've built here,

28:00.980 --> 28:04.583
because it's a new iteration
of -- of soap for children

28:04.616 --> 28:06.252
that is really appealing --
I get it.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.554
But what's missing
in your equation, all right,

28:08.587 --> 28:10.522
is an understanding
of the sales process

28:10.556 --> 28:13.025
and how you get leverage
to do that

28:13.059 --> 28:15.127
and reducing your customer
acquisition costs.

28:15.161 --> 28:18.164
Somebody should be
pounding out content every day

28:18.197 --> 28:19.465
to the algorithms set...
Herjavec: Yes.

28:19.498 --> 28:22.802
...by TikTok, by Instagram,
Twitter every day.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.772
Because you want to get
these customers for free.

28:25.805 --> 28:29.708
Really savvy marketers do that
with products like this,

28:29.742 --> 28:32.044
and I don't think you have that
nailed down yet.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.913
So, for that reason --
because I think

28:33.946 --> 28:35.915
you're too early --
I'm out.

28:35.948 --> 28:38.350
**

28:38.384 --> 28:40.086
Look, guys,
you're not too early.

28:40.119 --> 28:42.088
But you haven't found
the way to sell it yet.

28:42.121 --> 28:44.957
I would get on every
message board on Facebook,

28:44.991 --> 28:48.961
every Group I can find --
on Nextdoor and everywhere,

28:48.995 --> 28:50.863
posting pictures,
posting videos,

28:50.897 --> 28:52.965
and telling them
about your product.

28:52.999 --> 28:56.035
That's a 24x7x365 job.
Yeah.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.270
You just have to eat,
sleep, and breathe it,

28:58.304 --> 29:00.072
and it'd be relentless.

29:00.106 --> 29:02.241
This is not, you know,
an investment for me.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.475
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.611
But I think you've got
a great product,

29:05.644 --> 29:08.747
but you've just got to get out
there and be relentless.

29:08.781 --> 29:12.852
Look, I-I couldn't admire
or respect you more.

29:12.885 --> 29:16.022
I wish you all the best,
but for now, I'm out.

29:17.156 --> 29:20.759
Listen, ladies,
you've done a great job.

29:20.793 --> 29:22.661
I mean, you're just
out of school,

29:22.694 --> 29:24.797
and you create a product

29:24.831 --> 29:27.466
that is a better mousetrap,
so to speak.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.869
The best inventions
are things that are

29:29.902 --> 29:32.371
just something smarter
than what already existed.

29:32.404 --> 29:35.407
But it's just too early for me
as an investment.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.944
I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.

29:37.977 --> 29:40.412
Lori, kids need this
right now,

29:40.446 --> 29:42.348
especially
with the pandemic.
They do.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.483
They do.
So, you know, we finally
have supply chain --

29:44.516 --> 29:45.918
Lori's out.
You have one Shark left --

29:45.952 --> 29:47.786
Nirav right here.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.656
Tolia: Well, guys, there is
so much to like about you.

29:50.689 --> 29:52.324
Just listening
to your story

29:52.358 --> 29:55.027
and even seeing you
struggle up there,

29:55.061 --> 29:57.763
it reminds me of being an
entrepreneur and trying to sell.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.798
In fact,
little-known fact,

29:59.832 --> 30:03.235
I had a company in between
my first success and Nextdoor,

30:03.269 --> 30:05.838
and I pitched it
to Mr. Cuban over here.

30:05.872 --> 30:08.640
And he treated me
not so differently

30:08.674 --> 30:10.176
than some of the Sharks
are treating you.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.979
A lot of good advice,
but ultimately, it wasn't right.

30:13.012 --> 30:16.282
I think it may be
a little too early

30:16.315 --> 30:18.317
for you to take on
more investment.

30:18.350 --> 30:21.888
My advice to you guys
is to find some mentors

30:21.921 --> 30:24.123
and continue to iterate.

30:24.156 --> 30:27.059
I believe very deeply
in you guys.

30:27.093 --> 30:30.762
But for those reasons,
as an investment, I'm out.

30:30.796 --> 30:31.830
Okay.
Thank you.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.065
- Good luck, guys.
- Thank you so much, guys.

30:33.099 --> 30:34.233
- Good luck, guys.
- Good luck, guys.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.434
It's a great product.
- We appreciate you.

30:35.467 --> 30:36.969
Thank you.
Thank you.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.872
**

30:39.906 --> 30:41.140
They were great.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.375
They were great.
And I love the product.

30:43.409 --> 30:45.844
Yeah, it's a great product.
It's super smart.
I love this, I do.

30:45.878 --> 30:48.514
I think I made a mistake.

30:48.547 --> 30:49.815
They're down there
somewhere.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.617
Just go down there
and get them.

30:51.650 --> 30:56.588
**

30:56.622 --> 30:59.058
We got a lot of good advice
out there arou--

30:59.091 --> 31:01.293
I'm so -- I'm so sorry
to interrupt.
Hey, Nirav.

31:01.327 --> 31:03.762
No, worries.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Hi, guys.
I'm -- I'm sorry to interrupt.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.397
Let me run
something by you.

31:05.431 --> 31:08.434
My beautiful wife,
Megha Tolia,

31:08.467 --> 31:10.369
for the last seven years
has been working

31:10.402 --> 31:12.471
as an executive
on the Method,

31:12.504 --> 31:15.474
Mrs. Meyer's,
and Ecover soap brands.
Oh, my God.
That sounds wonderful.

31:15.507 --> 31:18.010
So I think the two of us
together -- my wife and I --

31:18.044 --> 31:19.912
could really help you get
this thing off the ground.

31:19.946 --> 31:22.781
So does that sound like
something you want to consider?

31:22.814 --> 31:24.783
What do you think?
Is this a joke?
Of course!

31:24.816 --> 31:26.418
Okay, it's not a joke.
It's not a joke.

31:26.452 --> 31:29.255
But let's admit --
you're very early.
Yes.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.390
And there are lots of things
that have to happen.
Definitely.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.759
And so, here's the way
that I think about it.
Yes.

31:33.792 --> 31:36.228
Mm-hmm.
I'm happy to put in
the $100,000.

31:36.262 --> 31:38.530
I would like to have
10% of the company.
Yeah.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.266
However, for safety,

31:40.299 --> 31:44.070
what I would like to propose
is a $1 royalty

31:44.103 --> 31:47.139
that pays back
$1 per unit sold

31:47.173 --> 31:49.475
until I reach $200,000,

31:49.508 --> 31:51.477
at which point,
the royalty goes away.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.312
You have nothing else
that you owe me

31:53.345 --> 31:55.114
besides the original 10%.

31:55.147 --> 31:59.285
And I'm doing this not just
because I believe in SoaPen.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.153
I'm really doing it
because I believe in you guys,

32:01.187 --> 32:02.554
and I want
to see you succeed.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.456
That is our offer,

32:04.490 --> 32:06.125
and I hope you accept it.

32:06.158 --> 32:08.294
If you don't,
not a problem.

32:10.496 --> 32:11.630
We'll take it. [ Laughs ]
We're on.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.465
Let's do it!
All right!

32:13.499 --> 32:15.968
To SoaPen!
Thank you so much!

32:16.002 --> 32:18.537
We can't wait
to meet your wife.
Wow, what a surprise!

32:39.225 --> 32:41.893
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Christina Funke Tegbe.

32:41.927 --> 32:43.095
I'm from Houston, Texas,

32:43.129 --> 32:47.333
and I'm seeking $250,000
for 10% of my company.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.901
Growing up,
my family shared with me

32:49.935 --> 32:52.271
the richness
of my African heritage,

32:52.304 --> 32:54.806
including African
beauty secrets.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.875
Growing from the shea tree
in Africa,

32:56.908 --> 33:00.379
this nut produces
what we all know as shea butter.

33:00.412 --> 33:03.115
And, boy, did I love
this moisturizer.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.417
So it's no reason
my aunt in Nigeria

33:05.451 --> 33:07.953
persuaded people
traveling from her village

33:07.986 --> 33:11.823
to pack tubs of pure shea butter
to my family in Texas.

33:11.857 --> 33:14.026
And when I say tubs...

33:15.127 --> 33:17.829
...I mean,
this beauty right here.

33:17.863 --> 33:20.366
[ Laughter ]
Wrapped in cellophane.

33:20.399 --> 33:21.433
Fancy, right?

33:21.467 --> 33:23.569
But, Sharks,
this thing is magic.

33:23.602 --> 33:27.339
Inspired by my own heritage,
I took this little gem

33:27.373 --> 33:30.509
and turned it into
54 Thrones.

33:30.542 --> 33:32.844
Standing for the 54 countries
in Africa,

33:32.878 --> 33:35.581
we partner directly
with African co-operatives

33:35.614 --> 33:38.016
to create our line
of clean beauty products

33:38.050 --> 33:40.486
while promoting trade,
not aid.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.854
Our products are
decadent and divine,

33:42.888 --> 33:46.292
from our Glow Body Oil
to our Moroccan Body Mask

33:46.325 --> 33:49.261
and our award-winning
African beauty butters.

33:49.295 --> 33:52.030
54 Thrones is here
to celebrate the beauty,

33:52.064 --> 33:55.534
the luxury, the romance
the motherland has to offer.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.769
So, Sharks,
who's ready to spread

33:57.803 --> 34:01.240
the 54 Thrones wealth
with the world?

34:01.273 --> 34:03.209
Nice job.
Cuban:
Great presentation.

34:03.242 --> 34:05.311
Pretty packaging here.
There are some samples
in front of you for you to try.

34:05.344 --> 34:07.012
These are some of
our best-sellers.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.314
What should
we try first?

34:08.347 --> 34:10.849
My favorite is
our African Beauty Butter

34:10.882 --> 34:13.385
in the Egyptian lavender
and Moroccan mint scent.

34:13.419 --> 34:16.155
So that would be
in the purp--
You gotta tell me
what we use these things for.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.357
Right?
So, our products
are universal.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.426
You can use them
from hair to toe.

34:20.459 --> 34:22.228
The beauty butters
are our best-selling

34:22.261 --> 34:23.629
hand and body butter.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.231
Herjavec: Christina,
they're very oily.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.032
Obviously, that must be
by design.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.334
So, they're
a butter, right?

34:28.367 --> 34:29.868
Which is different
from lotions.

34:29.901 --> 34:32.771
Many people are used
to water-based lotions,

34:32.804 --> 34:36.108
and water actually draws out
the moisture in your skin.

34:36.142 --> 34:38.577
But shea butters
and another botanical oils,

34:38.610 --> 34:40.512
they seal the moisture
into your skin.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.348
You don't need much.
You don't need much.

34:42.381 --> 34:43.849
Exactly, Kevin.
I think I used too much.

34:43.882 --> 34:45.817
You probably did.
[ Laughter ]

34:45.851 --> 34:47.353
You need a towel.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.054
Okay, let's dig into
the business itself.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.989
So when
did you start this?

34:51.022 --> 34:52.191
Give us the background.
Yes.

34:52.224 --> 34:54.893
So, we just turned
five years old last month,

34:54.926 --> 34:57.296
and it's been
a long journey.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.531
I'm a first-generation
American.

34:59.565 --> 35:02.168
My father immigrated here
from Nigeria.

35:02.201 --> 35:04.536
He was a janitor.
He was a cook.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.705
All this while in school
to be a CPA.

35:06.738 --> 35:10.075
He always taught us
to have pride in who we were,

35:10.108 --> 35:11.643
have pride in being Nigerian,

35:11.677 --> 35:13.145
and just have pride
in ourselves.

35:13.179 --> 35:15.614
And so, I went to school.
I have two master's.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.015
I went to Tulane University.
Wow.

35:17.048 --> 35:19.117
Wow.
I have an MBA,
and I also have a master's

35:19.151 --> 35:20.419
in health care
administration.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.520
- Wow.
- Good for you.

35:21.553 --> 35:23.655
So, I worked as a consultant
for a few years,

35:23.689 --> 35:25.157
and then I quit.

35:25.191 --> 35:27.359
I had this calling

35:27.393 --> 35:29.861
that I wanted to learn more
about my heritage.

35:29.895 --> 35:32.564
I wanted to learn the language.
I wanted to learn my history.

35:32.598 --> 35:33.932
So I quit my job.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.735
I didn't quit my job
to just start this business,

35:36.768 --> 35:40.406
but I quit my job because I
just -- I had a calling, right?

35:40.439 --> 35:42.040
I cashed out my 401(k),

35:42.073 --> 35:43.875
and I just started traveling
around Africa.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.143
And while I was there,

35:45.177 --> 35:47.513
I was just drawn
to all of the makers --

35:47.546 --> 35:50.982
the hardworking women making
argan oil, making shea butter.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.319
And so, I tagged along
with them.

35:53.352 --> 35:55.854
I learned about these
African beauty secrets.

35:55.887 --> 35:57.122
And then I said,
"You know what?

35:57.155 --> 35:59.325
I want to start a brand,
and I want to work directly

35:59.358 --> 36:00.759
with everyone
that I've met."

36:00.792 --> 36:02.027
What are your sales?

36:02.060 --> 36:03.995
So, last year, we made
a half a million dollars.

36:04.029 --> 36:05.163
Good for you.

36:05.197 --> 36:08.267
And that is with
a very tight marketing budget.

36:08.300 --> 36:11.203
Last year, I spent
about $8,000 in marketing.

36:11.237 --> 36:12.238
That's it?
Tolia: Wow.

36:12.271 --> 36:13.405
That's it.

36:13.439 --> 36:15.941
A lot of our traction
came from word-of-mouth.

36:15.974 --> 36:18.344
We also were on
"Oprah's Favorite Things."

36:18.377 --> 36:19.911
Ah.
So that tin that you have
in front of you

36:19.945 --> 36:21.947
was part of
"Oprah's Favorite Things."

36:21.980 --> 36:24.216
What were your sales
before Oprah?

36:24.250 --> 36:27.419
We had already hit
about $300,000 in revenue.

36:27.453 --> 36:28.620
Okay.

36:28.654 --> 36:31.423
And a lot of that kind of
comes from the things

36:31.457 --> 36:33.759
that were happening
in our society last year.

36:33.792 --> 36:36.728
Black-owned brands were getting
a lot of attention.

36:36.762 --> 36:38.264
People were finding them
and loving them

36:38.297 --> 36:39.531
and loving our products.

36:39.565 --> 36:41.967
So it really wasn't
a matter of there not being

36:42.000 --> 36:43.235
worthy Black-owned brands.

36:43.269 --> 36:44.570
People just couldn't find us.

36:44.603 --> 36:47.038
We didn't have the resources
to be on the aisles,

36:47.072 --> 36:49.308
to be on the shelves.
And, Christina, are you seeing
that being sustained at all?

36:49.341 --> 36:51.176
Absolutely.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.546
I have fo-- People that found us
last year are repeat customers.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.648
We have people that are
stocking up on our stuff.

36:56.682 --> 36:59.451
And so, we're on set
to make a million this year.

36:59.485 --> 37:01.753
Wow.
We're actually gonna be
launching in Sephora.

37:01.787 --> 37:02.754
Whoa!
Oh, whoa.

37:02.788 --> 37:04.222
We're gonna be
launching online

37:04.256 --> 37:06.258
in Sephora U.S. and Canada.

37:06.292 --> 37:07.526
Wow.
And this holiday season,

37:07.559 --> 37:10.228
we're actually gonna be
expanding to Nordstrom's.

37:10.262 --> 37:12.130
So are you selling
direct to consumer, as well?

37:12.163 --> 37:13.799
We're selling DTC
on our site.

37:13.832 --> 37:16.735
Last year,
we were at 75% DTC,

37:16.768 --> 37:18.770
and that's counting
the "Oprah's Favorite Things."
Yep.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.272
This year, it's gonna flip.

37:20.306 --> 37:22.708
We're gonna be at
about 25% DTC

37:22.741 --> 37:24.543
and about 75% retail.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.346
You have enough margin
to support the retail channel?

37:27.379 --> 37:29.615
So, the butter set that you have
in front of you,

37:29.648 --> 37:32.784
that cost me $12 to make,
and I sell it for $80.

37:32.818 --> 37:34.753
All: Wow!
You sell it for $80?

37:34.786 --> 37:36.522
Good margins.

37:36.555 --> 37:41.026
You know, I cannot fault you
for anything today.

37:41.059 --> 37:44.229
You did
a beautiful pitch.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.164
There's only one
problem for me.

37:46.197 --> 37:48.767
I got to be passionate
about everything I invest in,

37:48.800 --> 37:50.402
and I'm just not
feeling that.

37:50.436 --> 37:51.837
I'm out.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.372
Cuban: Christina, Christina.
Thank you.
I respect that.

37:53.405 --> 37:54.473
You're a rock star.

37:54.506 --> 37:57.543
I mean, everything that
you've presented to us

37:57.576 --> 38:00.245
has been right on
from a business perspective.

38:00.278 --> 38:03.081
Problem is, I don't understand
what these things do.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.617
In order for me to come up
with ways to help you,

38:05.651 --> 38:07.553
I have to have
a fundamental understanding,

38:07.586 --> 38:09.220
and I just don't.

38:09.254 --> 38:11.189
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.

38:11.222 --> 38:12.358
Thank you, Mark.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.426
O'Leary: So, your
presentation was flawless.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.962
The great value
of Mr. Wonderful

38:16.995 --> 38:18.464
is my millions
of followers.

38:18.497 --> 38:20.832
And I sell a lot of stuff
on QVC, too.

38:20.866 --> 38:23.735
But I just don't see myself
sitting there saying,

38:23.769 --> 38:25.737
"I'm the right
brand representative."

38:25.771 --> 38:27.272
[ Laughs ]
But that's why
you have me.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.408
I'm the right
brand representative.
No, I get it. I get it.

38:29.441 --> 38:32.378
It's -- It's sort of --
As a pure investment,

38:32.411 --> 38:34.346
I find it
quite interesting,

38:34.380 --> 38:35.681
'cause I think
this is gonna work.

38:35.714 --> 38:38.350
I really do, 'cause I think
you're very good at selling it.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.586
But I'm not adding
any value other than money.

38:40.619 --> 38:43.589
In everything I do, I add
the Mr. Wonderful magic.

38:43.622 --> 38:46.858
Mr. Wonderful,
you are an advertising genius.

38:46.892 --> 38:48.126
That is what I need.
That's so true.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.561
I took $8,000...
[ Cuban laughs ]

38:49.595 --> 38:52.864
...and turned that into a half
a million dollars last year.

38:52.898 --> 38:57.002
Well, listen, you're very,
very, very impressive.

38:57.035 --> 38:59.738
I recently did a deal

38:59.771 --> 39:01.973
with a couple
of young women

39:02.007 --> 39:04.976
who had created
not only a cosmetic line,

39:05.010 --> 39:07.178
but a skincare line
that goes with it.

39:07.212 --> 39:10.416
Unfortunately,
you are so competitive

39:10.449 --> 39:14.019
with what we're already doing,
I have to be out.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.086
Thank you, Lori.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.688
Tolia: You know,
I want to tell you,

39:16.722 --> 39:20.426
you are so backable
as an entrepreneur.

39:20.459 --> 39:23.862
You are so impressive.
Your story is so compelling.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.931
You know what?
My wife has worked

39:25.964 --> 39:27.699
for over eight years
at Neutrogena,

39:27.733 --> 39:30.769
so I can almost hear her
whispering in my ear

39:30.802 --> 39:33.138
that skincare
is not a fad.

39:33.171 --> 39:35.707
It's something
that's here to stay.

39:35.741 --> 39:38.043
I'm willing to give you
half the money

39:38.076 --> 39:40.746
if one of my fellow Sharks
will come in with me.

Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.

39:53.659 --> 39:55.494
Nirav is interested
in Christina's

39:55.527 --> 39:58.897
shea butter-based
skincare line, 54 Thrones.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.567
But he wants another Shark
to partner with him.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.503
**

40:04.536 --> 40:07.539
Okay,
I'll do $250,000 for 20%.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.775
If you want to come in for half,
you're there.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.276
And we'll back you...
I'm definitely there.

40:11.309 --> 40:13.579
...and we'll blow
this thing up.

40:13.612 --> 40:16.214
Tolia: I am completely
in on the offer

40:16.247 --> 40:18.349
because I think
what you're building here

40:18.383 --> 40:21.520
is not just a company,
I think it is a movement,

40:21.553 --> 40:24.055
and I'd like to be
part of it.

40:24.089 --> 40:28.193
Can we do $250,000 for 15%?

40:29.294 --> 40:34.332
Think about this.
It makes me be a 7 1/2% guy.

40:34.365 --> 40:35.734
That's just not a lot.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.737
7 1/2% of $100
million-company...
No, I get that.

40:38.770 --> 40:39.871
...is still a good size.
Listen, I get it.

40:39.905 --> 40:41.540
But think about
the story here.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.475
You've got
an entrepreneur here

40:43.509 --> 40:45.811
with a proven track record
of growing a behemoth

40:45.844 --> 40:46.978
and, in his family,

40:47.012 --> 40:49.848
some incredible expertise
in your sector.

40:49.881 --> 40:53.018
You have me, which has
a massive following socially

40:53.051 --> 40:55.020
and a lot of television
exposure, okay?

40:55.053 --> 40:57.388
Listen, listen,
I believe in you so much

40:57.422 --> 40:59.057
that I'm willing
to put in

40:59.090 --> 41:01.259
half of the amount
just like Kevin,

41:01.292 --> 41:04.996
and you can give him
more equity to satisfy --

41:05.030 --> 41:07.699
I'm not gonna say
the greedy Mr. Wonderful,

41:07.733 --> 41:09.601
but I want
to support you.
I just need 10%.

41:09.635 --> 41:11.837
So, what's the offer?
What would be the offer?

41:11.870 --> 41:13.872
So you want $250,000
for 15%?

41:13.905 --> 41:16.374
I want $250,000 for 10%.

41:16.407 --> 41:19.711
[ Laughter ]

41:19.745 --> 41:21.580
You raised it again!
Greiner: You go, girl.

41:21.613 --> 41:22.881
I'm not doing that deal.
I'm not gonna do that deal.

41:22.914 --> 41:25.617
So, look, we -- we gotta stick
to our guns on this one.

41:25.651 --> 41:28.554
So I'll let Kevin do
the whole thing if he wants.

41:28.587 --> 41:30.355
If you would like both of us
to be in --

41:30.388 --> 41:32.924
I want both of --
I want both Sharks.
Of course you should
have two Sharks,

41:32.958 --> 41:35.060
but think about it --
you have to let us

41:35.093 --> 41:36.762
wet our beaks
in the butter.

41:36.795 --> 41:40.265
Will you do $250,000
for 17%?

41:40.298 --> 41:42.568
It's so close to 20%.
Will you please do --

41:42.601 --> 41:44.235
But he said he'd give you
more equity, so if he takes --

41:44.269 --> 41:46.471
Guys, our platform is trade,
not aid.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.206
I'll take 7%,
he can take 10%.

7 1/2%. 7 1/2%.

Fine, 7 1/2%.

42:18.770 --> 42:21.372
I cannot wait
to call my partners

42:21.406 --> 42:24.409
in Ghana and Morocco
and tell them what happened,

42:24.442 --> 42:26.845
because I told them
I was going to "Shark Tank,"

42:26.878 --> 42:28.146
and I don't know
if they knew what it was,

42:28.179 --> 42:30.548
but they prayed for me,
and it worked out.

42:33.418 --> 42:42.828
**

42:42.861 --> 42:52.270
**

42:52.303 --> 43:01.780
**
