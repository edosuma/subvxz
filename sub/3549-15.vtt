WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:03.204
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:03.204 --> 00:05.705
HE'S IN YOUR BAND.
THIS IS TOO DANGEROUS.

00:05.705 --> 00:09.140
THERE WERE VICTIMS
OF BOTH VIOLENCE

00:09.140 --> 00:12.113
AND HARD TIMES.
 WE'RE SORT OF BROKE.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.615
I THOUGHT SCAVO'S
WAS DOING WELL.
 WHEN TIMES GET TOUGH,

00:14.615 --> 00:16.687
PEOPLE DO WITHOUT THINGS
LIKE PIZZA.

00:16.687 --> 00:18.049
AND BENEFICIARIES...

00:18.049 --> 00:21.192
THE DEAL CLOSED.
I GOT THE BONUS.
 AND GOOD WORK...

00:21.192 --> 00:22.523
AND PERSEVERANCE.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.196
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR NEW JOB.

00:25.196 --> 00:27.658
CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING ME
OUT OF YOUR OFFICE.

00:32.563 --> 00:34.565
(Mary Alice) IT'S NOT HARD

00:34.565 --> 00:37.338
TO SPOT A MOTHER
WHO WORKS OUTSIDE THE HOME.

00:37.338 --> 00:41.642
JUST LOOK FOR SOMEONE
WHO DRESSES IN A HURRY...

00:41.642 --> 00:46.217
EATS HER BREAKFAST
WHILE RUSHING TO HER CAR...

00:46.217 --> 00:50.151
AND APPLIES HER MAKEUP
AS SHE DRIVES AWAY.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.153
BUT THE SUREST WAY

00:52.153 --> 00:55.526
TO SPOT A MOTHER
WHO WORKS OUTSIDE THE HOME?

00:55.526 --> 00:59.230
JUST LOOK FOR A CHILD...
 M.J.,
WHY AREN'T YOU DRESSED?

00:59.230 --> 01:01.562
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE
FOR OUR FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.265
(vomits)

01:04.265 --> 01:08.169
WHO GETS SICK
AT THE WORST POSSIBLE MOMENT.

01:10.541 --> 01:12.543
HEY, GUYS. HOW YOU DOING?

01:12.543 --> 01:14.745
HE'S SICK. I'M LATE.
THANKS FOR HELPING.

01:14.745 --> 01:17.478
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
I GOTTA WORK.
 SO DO I,

01:17.478 --> 01:19.810
AND IT'S MY FIRST DAY
AT A NEW JOB. I WIN.

01:19.810 --> 01:21.152
WHAT... (sighs)

01:21.152 --> 01:23.184
LOOK, I'D REALLY LIKE
TO HELP YOU OUT...

01:23.184 --> 01:25.256
AND SPEND SOME TIME
WITH MY BEST BUD, BUT, UH,

01:25.256 --> 01:27.588
MS. NELSON'S SEPTIC TANK
IS EXPECTING ME AT 9:00.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.391
YOU'RE A PLUMBER. MS. NELSON
IS NOT EXPECTING YOU ON TIME.

01:30.391 --> 01:33.224
IN FACT, IF YOU SHOW UP BEFORE
DINNER, SHE'LL TURN CARTWHEELS.

01:33.224 --> 01:36.367
I'M A TEACHER.
IT'S DIFFERENT.

01:36.367 --> 01:39.300
WAIT, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST A TEACHER'S ASSISTANT.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.831
WELL...

01:43.874 --> 01:45.436
LISTEN TO ME.

01:45.436 --> 01:48.439
THE WHOLE REASON I WENT BACK TO
WORK IS SO WE COULD BOTH AFFORD

01:48.439 --> 01:51.312
TO GIVE M.J. THE THINGS
WE FELT HE NEEDED.

01:51.312 --> 01:54.785
NOW I'M DOING MY PART.
IT'S TIME YOU DO YOURS.

01:54.785 --> 01:55.846
(scoffs)

01:58.749 --> 02:01.292
I'LL RESCHEDULE MS. NELSON.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.695
(sighs)

02:04.695 --> 02:06.357
I GOTTA GO.

02:06.357 --> 02:09.360
YOU GET LOTS OF REST AND DRINK
PLENTY OF FLUIDS, OKAY?

02:09.360 --> 02:12.132
YOU NEVER LEFT ME
WHEN I'M SICK BEFORE.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.605
OH, I KNOW, HONEY.

02:14.605 --> 02:16.907
BUT MOMMY HAS A JOB NOW.
(chuckles)

02:16.907 --> 02:20.711
COME ON. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT?

02:21.842 --> 02:23.474
DON'T BE SAD.

02:23.474 --> 02:27.178
I AM GONNA PICK YOU BOTH UP
AT 6:00.

02:27.178 --> 02:28.849
(chuckles)

02:28.849 --> 02:30.851
YES, IT'S NOT HARD

02:30.851 --> 02:33.754
TO SPOT A MOTHER
WHO WORKS OUTSIDE THE HOME.

02:35.486 --> 02:37.488
JUST LOOK FOR A WOMAN

02:37.488 --> 02:39.830
WHO LEAVES HER HOUSE
EVERY MORNING

02:39.830 --> 02:54.205
FEELING INCREDIBLY GUILTY.

02:54.205 --> 02:56.907
IT BEGINS JUST AFTER SUNDOWN,

02:56.907 --> 02:58.949
AFTER A LONG DAY AT THE OFFICE,

02:58.949 --> 03:02.713
EXHAUSTED PEOPLE
START COMING HOME.

03:04.415 --> 03:08.259
(barks)
 SOME ARE MET
BY FAITHFUL PETS...

03:08.259 --> 03:12.763
SOME ARE WELCOMED
WITH DRY MARTINIS.

03:12.763 --> 03:17.868
OTHERS ARE GREETED
WITH DINNER ON THE TABLE.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.202
THEN THERE ARE THOSE

03:22.202 --> 03:25.376
WHO RETURN
FROM A LONG DAY AT WORK...

03:25.376 --> 03:28.509
ONLY TO DISCOVER...

03:30.641 --> 03:32.983
UNPLEASANT SURPRISES.

03:36.947 --> 03:39.920
OH! GOOD. YOU GOT MY NOTE.
COME ON IN.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.253
OKAY, SURE.
UH, WHERE'S M.J.?

03:42.253 --> 03:44.224
HERE I AM, MOMMY.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.958
OH, HEY, BABY. HOW'S MY BOY?

03:47.958 --> 03:51.231
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.
(chuckles)

03:51.231 --> 03:52.903
ARE YOU FEELING BETTER?

03:52.903 --> 03:55.936
YEAH.
KATHERINE MADE ME SOUP

03:55.936 --> 03:57.938
AND READ ME A STORY

03:57.938 --> 04:01.312
AND SHOWED ME
HOW TO PLAY BLACKJACK.

04:01.312 --> 04:03.644
WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA REMEMBER?

04:03.644 --> 04:06.977
ALWAYS DOUBLE DOWN
ON A PAIR OF ACES.

04:06.977 --> 04:08.949
(chuckles) THAT'S CUTE.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.651
WHERE'S MIKE?

04:10.651 --> 04:11.952
PLUMBING EMERGENCY.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.954
MS. NELSON'S TOILET
BEGAN ERUPTING,

04:13.954 --> 04:16.987
AND I WASN'T BUSY, SO...

04:16.987 --> 04:18.358
UH-HUH.

04:18.358 --> 04:21.462
WELL, UH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR HELPING US OUT.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.834
COME ON, M.J.
IT'S TIME TO GO.

04:27.498 --> 04:29.039
(laughs)

04:29.039 --> 04:31.372
(M.J.) THANK YOU.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.504
(laughs)

04:33.504 --> 04:36.407
WE ALREADY THANKED HER,
BUDDY.

04:36.407 --> 04:38.609
LET'S NOT
MAKE HER UNCOMFORTABLE.

04:40.851 --> 04:43.314
(Bree) THANK YOU
FOR HAVING US OVER.

04:43.314 --> 04:45.316
WE ARE SO HONORED

04:45.316 --> 04:47.318
TO BE THE FIRST GUESTS
IN YOUR NEW HOME.

04:47.318 --> 04:50.060
YOUR STUNNING NEW HOME.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

04:50.060 --> 04:53.293
THE THEME OF MY FIRST PLACE
WAS EARLY AMERICAN BEANBAG.
 (laughs)

04:53.293 --> 04:55.065
(laughs)
WELL, IT'S ALL ANDREW.

04:55.065 --> 04:57.328
HE'S THE ONE WITH THE TASTE.
PLEASE.

04:57.328 --> 05:00.070
UH, HE'S RUNNING LATE.

05:00.070 --> 05:02.373
UM, DO YOU KNOW WHY?

05:02.373 --> 05:04.905
AH, HE'S CLEANING UP
A LITTLE MESS.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.907
SOMEONE DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULDN'T SERVE

05:06.907 --> 05:09.039
BACON-WRAPPED SHRIMP PUFFS
AT A BAR MITZVAH.

05:09.039 --> 05:11.642
I KNEW. I JUST THOUGHT
IF THEY'D TASTED MINE,

05:11.642 --> 05:13.644
THEY MIGHT CHANGE THE RULES.
 (laughs)

05:13.644 --> 05:16.887
SO WOULD YOU LIKE SOMETHING
TO NIBBLE ON BEFORE DINNER?

05:16.887 --> 05:19.019
IS THAT CUT CRYSTAL?

05:19.019 --> 05:21.051
IT'S EXQUISITE.

05:21.051 --> 05:23.053
ANDREW AGAIN.
HE'S GOT EXPENSIVE TASTE.

05:23.053 --> 05:24.925
THANK GOD HE BRINGS IN
THE BIG BUCKS.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.927
HE DOES?

05:26.927 --> 05:30.561
WELL, HE DOES NOW, EVER SINCE
YOU GAVE HIM THAT RAISE.

05:30.561 --> 05:33.604
(mouths word)
THIS IS A DELICIOUS SNACK.

05:33.604 --> 05:35.436
DID YOU MAKE THIS?

05:35.436 --> 05:37.468
UH, YEAH. IT'S JUST...

05:37.468 --> 05:38.809
PARTY MIX.

05:38.809 --> 05:40.541
OH.

05:40.541 --> 05:43.644
YOU GAVE ANDREW A RAISE?
 A TINY SALARY BUMP.

05:43.644 --> 05:46.477
"TINY" IS NOT THE WORD FOR
YOUR EXTRAORDINARY GENEROSITY.

05:46.477 --> 05:48.479
(cork pops)

05:48.479 --> 05:51.982
(gasps) OH, LOOK!
THERE'S PRETZELS AND CEREAL.

05:51.982 --> 05:54.054
I CAN SEE WHY
THEY CALL IT "PARTY MIX."

05:54.054 --> 05:56.056
IT'S LIKE A PARTY IN A BOWL.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.489
WHEN YOU SAY "EXTRAORDINARY"--
 (lowered voice)
HE'S EXAGGERATING.

05:58.489 --> 06:00.090
THEY'RE CHILDREN.

06:00.090 --> 06:01.962
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE
A LOT OF MONEY TO THEM.

06:05.135 --> 06:06.837
(sighs)

06:06.837 --> 06:09.800
MY GOD!
IS THIS A... '96 LATOUR?

06:09.800 --> 06:12.903
I KNOW. ANDREW BOUGHT
A CASE OF IT AT A WINE AUCTION

06:12.903 --> 06:15.746
TO CELEBRATE THAT HUGE RAISE.

06:15.746 --> 06:18.048
ONCE YOU'VE HAD
A FEW GLASSES OF THIS,

06:18.048 --> 06:20.951
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO REMEMBER
THIS EVENING AT ALL.

06:22.052 --> 06:23.754
WE'LL SEE.

06:25.686 --> 06:29.059
BOY,
DINNER WITHOUT THE KIDS...

06:29.059 --> 06:32.062
IT'S NICE TO EAT WITHOUT
HAVING MACARONI THROWN AT YOU.

06:32.062 --> 06:33.764
(all laugh)
 YES.

06:33.764 --> 06:35.766
WELL, WE, UH, WE REALLY
WANTED TO FIND A WAY

06:35.766 --> 06:37.768
TO THANK YOU BOTH.
 THANK US FOR WHAT?

06:37.768 --> 06:39.700
SAVING OUR MARRIAGE.

06:39.700 --> 06:43.504
PLEASE. IT WAS OUR PLEASURE.
HOW DID WE DO THAT AGAIN?

06:43.504 --> 06:45.906
WELL, BRADLEY HAD BEEN
WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK,

06:45.906 --> 06:47.908
AND I WAS FEELING NEGLECTED.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.910
BUT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT
NOW THAT HE HAS CARLOS.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.912
WE HAVE NEVER FELT CLOSER.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.815
AND, GABY, I KNOW I'VE BEEN
RELYING ON CARLOS A LOT.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.887
I-I HOPE IT'S NOT A PROBLEM, HIS
BEING AWAY FROM HOME SO MUCH.

06:56.887 --> 06:58.889
OH, I'LL BE
MORE WILLING TO FORGIVE

06:58.889 --> 07:00.951
ONCE HIS BONUS CHECK COMES IN.
 AND THE ONLY PERSON

07:00.951 --> 07:03.924
MORE EXCITED THAN GABY
ABOUT THAT BONUS IS HER JEWELER.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.596
(Gabrielle and Carlos laugh)

07:05.596 --> 07:07.598
BRAD, DON'T.
IT'S BEEN SUCH A NICE NIGHT.

07:07.598 --> 07:09.730
HE'S GONNA
HEAR IT TOMORROW ANYWAY.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.902
HEAR WHAT?

07:11.902 --> 07:13.664
LOOK, I'M SORRY,

07:13.664 --> 07:15.666
BUT WE'RE FORGOING BONUSES
THIS YEAR.

07:15.666 --> 07:18.569
CAN I GET ANYONE DESSERT?

07:18.569 --> 07:21.071
BEAT IT. WHAT?

07:21.071 --> 07:22.573
IT'S THE ECONOMY.

07:22.573 --> 07:24.915
UM, OUR C.F.O. FEELS WE NEED
TO DO SOME BELT TIGHTENING.

07:24.915 --> 07:28.118
BUT DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
OVERTIME CARLOS HAS PULLED?

07:28.118 --> 07:31.151
HOW MANY TRIPS HE'S TAKEN?
HE'S KILLED HIMSELF.

07:31.151 --> 07:34.024
FOR GOD SAKES,
DON'T DO THIS TO MY JEWELER.

07:34.024 --> 07:37.958
BUT, GABY, NO ONE'S GETTING
A BONUS, NOT EVEN BRAD.

07:37.958 --> 07:41.492
SO THIS WAS HIS BONUS? A SALAD
AND A STUFFED CHICKEN BREAST?

07:41.492 --> 07:44.134
LOOK, HOPEFULLY NEXT YEAR
WILL BE BETTER.

07:44.134 --> 07:46.096
(sighs)

07:46.096 --> 07:47.968
WE'RE READY FOR DESSERT NOW.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.501
WRAP UP TEN LOBSTERS TO GO.

07:53.043 --> 07:55.976
AHEM.

07:55.976 --> 07:59.650
TOM?

07:59.650 --> 08:01.111
COME HERE.

08:01.111 --> 08:04.114
WE HAVEN'T HAD A CUSTOMER
IN ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR,

08:04.114 --> 08:06.116
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST...
 (pats hands)

08:06.116 --> 08:07.988
CLOSE UP EARLY.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.765
NO. I GOT AN IDEA.

08:14.765 --> 08:17.067
HEY, EVERYBODY, HEY,
TAKE OFF YOUR APRONS

08:17.067 --> 08:19.830
AND COME SIT NEAR THE WINDOW.

08:19.830 --> 08:22.573
WHAT IS THIS?
 IT'S CALLED PSYCHOLOGY.

08:22.573 --> 08:25.876
COME ON! HEY! GUYS...

08:25.876 --> 08:28.979
NOBODY WANTS TO EAT
IN AN EMPTY RESTAURANT, RIGHT?

08:28.979 --> 08:31.682
SO, GUYS, THIS IS
WHAT WE ARE GONNA DO.

08:31.682 --> 08:33.813
AS SOON AS YOU SEE
SOMEONE GO BY,

08:33.813 --> 08:35.986
YOU LAUGH, ACT LIKE
YOU'RE HAVING A GREAT TIME.

08:35.986 --> 08:38.288
IT'LL DRAW THEM IN.

08:38.288 --> 08:40.289
SO NOW WE HAVE
PRETEND CUSTOMERS?

08:40.289 --> 08:42.292
GEE, LET'S THINK
OF SOMETHING TO DO

08:42.292 --> 08:43.554
WITH ALL THE PRETEND MONEY
WE'RE GONNA MAKE.

08:43.554 --> 08:45.656
TRUST ME. THIS IS GONNA WORK.

08:45.656 --> 08:47.127
OKAY, HEY, YOU GUYS,

08:47.127 --> 08:49.129
YOU'RE A GROUP
OF OLD HIGH SCHOOL BUDDIES.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.231
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER
SINCE THE BIG GAME.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.233
AND YOU TWO--
YOU'RE ON A HOT DATE, OKAY?

08:53.233 --> 08:55.065
(chuckles) ALL RIGHT.

08:55.065 --> 08:57.568
HEY, LOOK! THERE'S SOMEBODY!
LAUGH! HAVE A GREAT TIME.

08:57.568 --> 08:59.770
(all laughing)

08:59.770 --> 09:01.612
(laughter stops)

09:01.612 --> 09:04.274
AWESOME. JUST LIKE THAT.

09:04.274 --> 09:07.848
OKAY...

09:07.848 --> 09:10.150
AS MUCH AS I LOVE
TOMMY SCAVO'S IMPROV THEATER,

09:10.150 --> 09:13.153
WE NEED
TO FACE SOME FACTS HERE.
 IT'S A SLUMP.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.626
WE--WE--WE--WE'LL RIDE IT OUT.
WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

09:15.626 --> 09:17.087
WE--
 IT'S NOT A SLUMP.

09:17.087 --> 09:19.590
IN THIS ECONOMY, PEOPLE AREN'T
EATING OUT AS MUCH.

09:19.590 --> 09:22.092
BETWEEN THAT
AND PORTER'S LEGAL BILLS

09:22.092 --> 09:23.563
AND PAYING BREE BACK,

09:23.563 --> 09:26.096
WE ARE ABOUT A WEEK AWAY
FROM GOING BANKRUPT.

09:26.096 --> 09:28.098
(laughter)

09:28.098 --> 09:30.140
(laughter stops)
 HONEY, PLEASE,
HAVE A LITTLE FAITH.

09:30.140 --> 09:32.142
I DID, FOR SEVEN YEARS.

09:32.142 --> 09:35.806
NOW I'M GONNA BE A REALIST,
AND I NEED YOU TO BE ONE, TOO.

09:35.806 --> 09:38.849
OKAY, I UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE WORRIED. I AM, TOO.

09:38.849 --> 09:41.852
BUT WE CAN MAKE IT.
WE JUST HAVE TO BE CREATIVE.

09:41.852 --> 09:43.854
BUT--
 IF WE SELL THIS PLACE NOW,

09:43.854 --> 09:45.916
WE CAN ESCAPE WITH SOME DIGNITY
AND MAYBE EVEN SOME MONEY.

09:45.916 --> 09:48.218
BUT IF WE KEEP ON GOING
LIKE WE ARE,

09:48.218 --> 09:50.090
WE'RE GONNA LOSE EVERYTHING.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.093
NO!

09:53.093 --> 09:56.196
NO.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.368
I AM NOT GOING OUT
LIKE THIS.

09:58.368 --> 10:00.370
I AM NOT GONNA BE
A FAILURE.

10:00.370 --> 10:04.675
(laughter)

10:04.675 --> 10:09.209
(laughter stops)
 PLEASE TELL ME
THEY JUST SAW A CUSTOMER.

10:17.247 --> 10:19.249
SO WITH ALL THE CALORIES
WE JUST BURNED,

10:19.249 --> 10:22.953
I SAY WE DESERVE A HUGE LUNCH
AT A FANCY RESTAURANT.

10:22.953 --> 10:24.955
YOU DO LIKE
TO LIVE WELL, HONEY.

10:24.955 --> 10:27.958
WELL, WHY NOT? LIFE IS BRIEF
AND MOSTLY SUCKS.

10:27.958 --> 10:29.960
GOTTA GRAB
ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN

10:29.960 --> 10:31.962
WHILE YOU'RE
ON THIS SIDE OF THE DIRT.

10:31.962 --> 10:33.263
THAT WAS VERY POETIC.

10:33.263 --> 10:36.907
BUT SURE,
WE'LL GO ANY PLACE YOU WANT.

10:36.907 --> 10:38.869
MMM! THAT WAS EASY.

10:38.869 --> 10:41.171
WELL, SINCE I'M ON A ROLL,
HOW ABOUT THIS?

10:41.171 --> 10:43.173
LET'S GO AWAY THIS WEEKEND--

10:43.173 --> 10:47.417
PICK A FIVE-STAR HOTEL WITH
A GREAT SPA AND JUST LIVE IT UP.

10:47.417 --> 10:49.179
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

10:49.179 --> 10:52.182
I'VE GOT A LOT OF STUFF
I NEED TO DO.

10:52.182 --> 10:54.054
OH, COME ON.

10:54.054 --> 10:57.157
BIG FLUFFY ROBES,
LONG MASSAGES.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.229
(buzzing in distance)

10:59.229 --> 11:01.131
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

11:01.131 --> 11:03.734
(buzz)
 THAT BUZZING.

11:03.734 --> 11:05.065
(buzz)

11:05.065 --> 11:06.837
UH... NO,
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.
 (buzz)

11:06.837 --> 11:08.839
OH, MAYBE IT--IT'S--
 SHH! SHH!

11:08.839 --> 11:10.040
(buzz)

11:10.040 --> 11:12.042
I HEAR IT UP HERE
SOMETIMES.

11:12.042 --> 11:14.044
(buzz)

11:14.044 --> 11:17.307
WHAT THE HELL IS IT?

11:17.307 --> 11:20.310
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:20.310 --> 11:22.312
I KIND OF LIKE
THAT HOTEL IDEA.

11:22.312 --> 11:24.254
REALLY?

11:24.254 --> 11:27.217
YEAH. YOU WERE RIGHT.
LIFE IS BRIEF.

11:27.217 --> 11:30.220
WHY DON'T YOU GO CALL THE TRAVEL
AGENT AND SEE WHAT'S AVAILABLE?

11:30.220 --> 11:33.964
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE KINDA SEXY
WHEN YOU BUCKLE.

11:33.964 --> 11:36.226
I'M GONNA CALL RIGHT NOW.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.143
(beep)

11:53.143 --> 11:56.146
(woman) Dr. Heller?
Listen, I got your latest text,

11:56.146 --> 11:58.849
but you know,
it's been a few weeks now,

11:58.849 --> 12:01.922
and people are freaking out
about you being gone so long.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.894
So now there's a staff meeting
on the 15th,

12:03.894 --> 12:06.096
and if you're not back by then,
I'm just gonna

12:06.096 --> 12:08.398
have to tell people
that I don't know where you are.

12:08.398 --> 12:10.400
So will you please just call me?

12:16.066 --> 12:18.869
HEY, MIKE. HOW'S IT GOING?

12:18.869 --> 12:20.871
WELL, SO FAR,
I'VE BROKEN OFF

12:20.871 --> 12:22.873
THREE OF THESE STUPID
PLASTIC SPRINKLER HEADS.

12:22.873 --> 12:25.045
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
I'M GREAT.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.047
WELL, GOOD.
LOOK, I WAS COMING OVER TO ASK,

12:27.047 --> 12:31.281
WHAT WOULD YOU AND KATHERINE
THINK ABOUT GOING CAMPING?
 OH, MAN, I LOVE CAMPING. WHEN?

12:31.281 --> 12:33.283
WELL, MY SCHEDULE
GETS BUSY ON THE 15th,

12:33.283 --> 12:35.285
SO IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
BEFORE THEN.

12:35.285 --> 12:38.288
I DON'T KNOW, THIS WEEKEND?
 OH, I'M DEFINITELY
UP FOR IT.

12:38.288 --> 12:40.961
UH, I'M NOT SURE
IF KATHERINE WILL BE.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.994
WELL, IF SHE DOESN'T GO,
THEN EDIE WON'T GO, AND...

12:43.994 --> 12:46.496
WELL, I GUESS IF KATHERINE
KNOWS ANOTHER GIRL'S COMING,

12:46.496 --> 12:51.001
MAYBE I CAN CONVINCE HER.
 GOOD. TELL HER THE MENFOLK
WILL DO ALL THE HARD WORK--

12:51.001 --> 12:53.003
BUILD THE FIRES,
DIG THE LATRINES.

12:53.003 --> 12:55.005
HEY, I WOULDN'T MENTION
THAT, UH, LATRINE PART

12:55.005 --> 12:57.207
UNTIL WE'RE ACTUALLY
 AT THE CAMPSITE.

12:57.207 --> 12:58.949
(laughs)
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

12:58.949 --> 13:02.182
I'LL, UH, DIG MY GEAR OUT
TONIGHT. IT'S GONNA BE FUN.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.154
YEAH.

13:04.154 --> 13:07.157
(under breath)
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.361
MY, THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL PEN.

13:11.361 --> 13:13.363
IS IT A MONTBLANC?

13:13.363 --> 13:16.366
UH, YEAH. YEAH,
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED ONE.
 AH.

13:16.366 --> 13:20.070
WELL, I GUESS YOU CAN AFFORD IT
NOW WITH YOUR NEW RAISE.

13:20.070 --> 13:23.203
OH, YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT?
 I SURE DID.

13:23.203 --> 13:26.036
(door opens and closes)
 WELL, THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
JUST CALLED.

13:26.036 --> 13:28.108
THEY'VE ADDED 40 PEOPLE
TO THEIR GUEST LIST.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.410
DAMN IT.
I ONLY PLANNED FOR A HUNDRED.

13:30.410 --> 13:33.443
W-WE'RE GONNA NEED TABLES.
 RELAX. THEY ALWAYS
PULL THIS CRAP.

13:33.443 --> 13:35.445
SO I CALLED
THE RENTAL COMPANY

13:35.445 --> 13:38.418
AND HAD 'EM PUT A FEW EXTRAS
ON THE TRUCK. WE'LL BE FINE.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.420
OH, THANK GOD.
 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:40.420 --> 13:42.392
WE CAN TELL
THE CHAMBER PEOPLE

13:42.392 --> 13:44.394
THAT BECAUSE IT WAS
SO LAST-MINUTE,

13:44.394 --> 13:48.098
WE HAD TO BUMP OUR FEE
BY 30%.
 I LIKE THE WAY YOU THINK.

13:48.098 --> 13:50.500
OHH. WHAT WOULD WE DO
WITHOUT HIM?

13:50.500 --> 13:54.204
HMM, YES. HE'S WORTH
EVERY PENNY YOU PAY HIM.

13:54.204 --> 13:57.537
BY THE WAY...
HOW MANY PENNIES IS THAT?

13:57.537 --> 14:00.110
(scoffs) I'M NOT DISCUSSING
ANDREW'S SALARY WITH YOU.

14:00.110 --> 14:02.112
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

14:02.112 --> 14:04.174
(chuckles)
YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S NOT.

14:04.174 --> 14:05.845
SO... HOW MUCH?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.847
ANDREW MOVED
INTO A NEW HOME.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.620
I SIMPLY GAVE HIM
A COST OF LIVING INCREASE.

14:10.620 --> 14:12.622
THE COST OF LIVING
IN A HOME

14:12.622 --> 14:15.285
WITH SILVER PENS
AND RARE FRENCH WINES?

14:15.285 --> 14:17.627
HONEY,
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

14:17.627 --> 14:20.590
OH, MY GOD.
IS HE MAKING MORE THAN ME?

14:20.590 --> 14:22.292
ORSON, DROP IT.

14:22.292 --> 14:25.595
I AM NOT TELLING YOU
HOW MUCH ANDREW MAKES.

14:25.595 --> 14:28.168
(door opens and closes)

14:28.168 --> 14:30.870
I'D BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU
THAT INFORMATION, SIR.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.373
AM I SPEAKING
TO THE ACCOUNT HOLDER?

14:33.373 --> 14:36.446
NO, I'M HER...
BUSINESS PARTNER.

14:36.446 --> 14:38.448
Very well. Account number?

14:38.448 --> 14:41.411
YES. UM, 8-5-9-7-3.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.584
NAME ON THE ACCOUNT?

14:44.584 --> 14:47.117
VAN DE KAMP'S
OLD-FASHIONED FOODS.

14:47.117 --> 14:49.289
AND THE PASSWORD?

14:49.289 --> 14:50.991
PASSWORD?

14:50.991 --> 14:53.123
FOR SECURITY PURPOSES.

14:53.123 --> 14:54.664
UM...

14:54.664 --> 14:58.568
OH. YES. OF COURSE.
IT'S, UM...

14:58.568 --> 15:00.430
UH, YOU KNOW...
(chuckles nervously)

15:00.430 --> 15:02.572
UH, IT'S--IT'S COMPLETELY
SLIPPED MY MIND.

15:02.572 --> 15:06.276
IT'S THE NAME
OF HER CHILDHOOD PET.

15:06.276 --> 15:08.338
OH. RIGHT.

15:08.338 --> 15:10.240
UH...

15:10.240 --> 15:11.581
FLUFFY.

15:11.581 --> 15:13.243
NOPE. THAT'S NOT IT.

15:13.243 --> 15:14.384
FIDO?

15:14.384 --> 15:15.685
NO.

15:15.685 --> 15:17.547
SPOT? ROVER?

15:17.547 --> 15:18.918
MITTENS?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.120
SORRY, SIR.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.391
UH, MARMADUKE.

15:21.391 --> 15:23.323
OLD YELLER.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.325
I CANNOT GIVE OUT
ANY INFORMATION

15:25.325 --> 15:28.398
WITHOUT THE PASSWORD,
WHICH YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW.

15:28.398 --> 15:30.400
THEN ASK ME
A DIFFERENT QUESTION.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.303
HOW ABOUT HER DATE OF BIRTH?
HER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER?

15:33.303 --> 15:34.304
GOOD-BYE, SIR.

15:34.304 --> 15:36.306
HOW ABOUT
HER REAL HAIR COLOR?

15:36.306 --> 15:38.969
TRUST ME, IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.

15:38.969 --> 15:41.041
(line disconnects, dial tone)

15:41.041 --> 15:42.342
(pushes button)

15:44.314 --> 15:47.317
IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO GET FED,
IT'S GONNA BE A WHILE.

15:47.317 --> 15:49.319
NO,
DAD CALLED A FAMILY MEETING.

15:49.319 --> 15:52.222
YEAH, MOM, HE SAID
IT'S ABOUT THE RESTAURANT.

15:52.222 --> 15:56.987
OH, BOY. I THINK I KNOW
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

15:56.987 --> 15:58.588
(sighs) LISTEN, KIDS,

15:58.588 --> 16:02.192
THINGS HAVE BEEN TOUGH
DOWN AT THE RESTAURANT,

16:02.192 --> 16:05.235
AND I THINK YOUR DAD
HAS FINALLY DECIDED TO SELL IT.

16:06.696 --> 16:08.338
WOW.

16:08.338 --> 16:09.499
I KNOW.

16:09.499 --> 16:11.541
IS HE GONNA BE OKAY?

16:11.541 --> 16:14.544
I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S WHY WE ALL
HAVE TO BE REALLY SUPPORTIVE.

16:14.544 --> 16:17.647
ARE YOU WITH ME?

16:17.647 --> 16:19.309
HEY, GUYS.

16:19.309 --> 16:21.311
GOOD. YOU'RE ALL HERE.

16:21.311 --> 16:23.313
I LOVE YOU, DADDY.

16:23.313 --> 16:25.185
(under breath) NOT YET.

16:25.185 --> 16:29.689
SO... I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ALL ABOUT OUR PIZZERIA.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.761
JUST KNOW
WE'RE 100% BEHIND YOU.

16:31.761 --> 16:33.323
THAT MEANS A LOT,

16:33.323 --> 16:36.466
'CAUSE THIS WAS
A REALLY ROUGH DAY FOR ME.

16:36.466 --> 16:39.269
I HAD TO LET
ALL OUR EMPLOYEES GO.

16:39.269 --> 16:42.672
SO STARTING TOMORROW...

16:42.672 --> 16:46.106
YOU KIDS ARE MY NEW WAITSTAFF.

16:53.483 --> 16:56.446
TOM, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:56.446 --> 16:59.449
I GOT IT ALL WORKED OUT.
YOU AND I WILL HANDLE THE DAYS,

16:59.449 --> 17:03.293
AND THE KIDS WILL JOIN US AFTER
SCHOOL AND ON THE WEEKENDS.

17:03.293 --> 17:06.256
UM, AT THE RISK
OF SOUNDING SPOILED... NO.

17:06.256 --> 17:09.398
COME ON! IT'LL BE FANTASTIC.
WE'LL LOVE WORKING TOGETHER.

17:09.398 --> 17:11.761
WHY? WE DON'T EVEN LIKE
 LIVING TOGETHER.

17:11.761 --> 17:14.134
LOOK,
LABOR IS OUR NUMBER ONE COST.

17:14.134 --> 17:17.237
IF WE CAN ELIMINATE IT, WE'LL
START MAKING A PROFIT AGAIN.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.239
WHAT, YOU'RE NOT EVEN
GONNA PAY US?

17:19.239 --> 17:21.611
I'M 9! IS THAT EVEN LEGAL?

17:21.611 --> 17:23.272
I THINK SO.

17:23.272 --> 17:26.346
BUT JUST TO BE SAFE,
YOU'RE NOW 15. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

17:26.346 --> 17:29.219
MOM, PLEASE DO SOMETHING.

17:29.219 --> 17:31.681
(sighs)

17:36.226 --> 17:38.228
I THOUGHT MAYBE
AFTER OUR CONVERSATION TODAY,

17:38.228 --> 17:40.230
YOU'D REALIZE
IT'S TIME TO PACK IT IN.

17:40.230 --> 17:43.233
I HAVE GOT TO DO THIS. I CAN'T
WALK AWAY FROM THAT PLACE

17:43.233 --> 17:46.236
UNTIL I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING
THAT I CAN POSSIBLY THINK OF.

17:46.236 --> 17:49.239
BUT HAVING THE KIDS
WORK THERE?
 YOU SAID THAT
YOU WERE BEHIND ME 100%.

17:49.239 --> 17:51.301
REALLY?
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ME.

17:51.301 --> 17:52.642
LYNETTE...

17:52.642 --> 17:54.204
OKAY. FINE.

17:58.748 --> 18:01.811
KIDS, WE ARE GOING
TO SUPPORT YOUR FATHER

18:01.811 --> 18:04.454
BY WORKING
IN HIS RESTAURANT.

18:04.454 --> 18:07.457
(boys groan)
 (Penny) YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

18:07.457 --> 18:10.460
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
30 YEARS FROM NOW,

18:10.460 --> 18:13.463
WHEN YOU AND DAD
ARE OLD AND FEEBLE--
 YOU'RE PUTTING US

18:13.463 --> 18:16.095
IN THE CHEAPEST NURSING HOME
YOU CAN FIND.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.397
YEAH, I GOT IT.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.306
MRS. SOLIS,
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE HERE.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.308
I'VE GOT YOUR BRACELET
ALL POLISHED

18:28.308 --> 18:30.610
AND READY FOR A NIGHT
ON THE TOWN.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.343
OH, PUT IT ON
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.

18:33.343 --> 18:37.187
TURNS OUT I'M NOT GONNA BE
ABLE TO AFFORD IT RIGHT NOW...

18:37.187 --> 18:39.189
UNLESS YOU CAN HELP ME OUT
ON THE PRICE. (chuckles)

18:39.189 --> 18:41.621
WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND?

18:41.621 --> 18:43.623
YOU GIVE IT TO ME,

18:43.623 --> 18:47.257
AND THEN CALL YOUR INSURANCE
AND SAY IT WAS STOLEN?

18:49.259 --> 18:51.261
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

18:51.261 --> 18:54.564
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT
THE BRACELET, MRS. SOLIS.

18:54.564 --> 18:57.367
PERHAPS I CAN SHOW YOU SOMETHING
A BIT LESS EXPENSIVE.

18:57.367 --> 19:00.870
MAYBE SOME, UH, EARRINGS--
 OH, WILL YOU EXCUSE ME
A MINUTE?

19:03.413 --> 19:05.315
AH!

19:13.923 --> 19:15.525
(starts engine)

19:29.769 --> 19:33.203
CARLOS, GET IN HERE!

19:33.203 --> 19:35.475
I GOT A REAL SHOCKEROO
FOR YOU!

19:35.475 --> 19:38.478
YOU ARE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE THIS!

19:40.710 --> 19:43.553
BRAD! HI.

19:43.553 --> 19:45.415
UH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:45.415 --> 19:47.717
HE JUST STOPPED BY
WITH GREAT NEWS.

19:47.717 --> 19:49.719
I'M GETTING THAT BONUS
AFTER ALL.

19:49.719 --> 19:52.362
(Carlos laughs)
 REALLY?

19:52.362 --> 19:54.364
WELL, I WENT TO OUR C.F.O.,

19:54.364 --> 19:56.366
AND I TOLD HIM
IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM FAIR

19:56.366 --> 19:58.598
THAT MY RIGHT-HAND MAN
SHOULD GO UNREWARDED.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.301
ISN'T THAT GREAT?
WHAT KIND OF GUY DOES THAT?

20:01.301 --> 20:03.273
(both laugh)

20:03.273 --> 20:06.205
OH, I THINK I KNOW
THE KIND.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.309
SO, BRAD...

20:09.309 --> 20:12.312
WHAT SORT OF BONUS
ARE WE LOOKING AT?

20:12.312 --> 20:15.285
HOW DOES 20 GRAND SOUND?

20:15.285 --> 20:17.787
LIKE A GREAT
JUMPING OFF POINT.

20:17.787 --> 20:19.719
GABY.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.322
OH, HONEY, YOU HEARD MARIA
THE OTHER NIGHT.

20:22.322 --> 20:26.256
YOUR HARD WORK IS WHAT'S
BROUGHT THEM SO MUCH CLOSER.

20:29.499 --> 20:31.501
PAY NO ATTENTION TO MY WIFE.

20:31.501 --> 20:34.264
20 GRAND IS
A FANTASTIC BONUS.

20:34.264 --> 20:36.906
YOU KNOW, NOW THAT I HEAR
THE NUMBER OUT LOUD,

20:36.906 --> 20:40.270
IT DOES SEEM A LITTLE LOW,
AFTER ALL YOU'VE DONE.

20:40.270 --> 20:42.612
25 IS PROBABLY MORE FAIR.

20:42.612 --> 20:46.276
OH, BRAD. COME ON.
SAVING A MARRIAGE?

20:46.276 --> 20:48.278
YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE
ON THAT...

20:48.278 --> 20:50.350
AT LEAST NOT A SMALL ONE.

20:50.350 --> 20:53.252
GABY, WILL YOU KNOCK IT OFF?

20:53.252 --> 20:54.624
YOU'RE BEING RUDE.

20:54.624 --> 20:56.756
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.589
IT'S JUST--I REALLY WANTED
TO BUY THIS BRACELET I SAW TODAY

20:59.589 --> 21:01.831
DOWNTOWN
IN THIS LITTLE JEWELRY SHOP.

21:01.831 --> 21:03.793
YOU KNOW THE PLACE, HONEY.

21:03.793 --> 21:06.336
IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE,
UM...

21:06.336 --> 21:07.737
LEXINGTON HOTEL.

21:07.737 --> 21:10.940
30!

21:10.940 --> 21:12.302
$30,000.

21:17.006 --> 21:18.978
ARE YOU SURE?

21:18.978 --> 21:22.412
YES! YOU DESERVE IT.
YOU BOTH DO.

21:22.412 --> 21:23.683
(chuckles)

21:23.683 --> 21:25.885
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.389
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
GETTING A BONUS,

21:29.389 --> 21:31.721
SO WHAT I THINK
MIGHT BE BEST IS

21:31.721 --> 21:35.495
IF WE ALL AGREED
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.367
DO WE ALL AGREE?

21:37.367 --> 21:39.399
ABSOLUTELY.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.531
(chuckles)

21:41.531 --> 21:44.534
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO TO BUSINESS.

21:44.534 --> 21:48.037
ALL THIS NEGOTIATING
JUST GOES RIGHT OVER MY HEAD.
 (slaps thighs)

21:50.740 --> 21:54.514
(sighs)

21:54.514 --> 21:56.946
(stovetop clicks on)

21:56.946 --> 21:58.518
HA!

21:58.518 --> 22:01.721
THUNDER McFADDEN.
(chuckles) WHAT A HOOT.

22:01.721 --> 22:03.423
WHAT'S THAT?

22:03.423 --> 22:06.356
OH, IT'S MY PORN NAME.

22:06.356 --> 22:08.428
A FRIEND SENT ME AN E-MAIL.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.430
YOU TAKE THE NAME
OF YOUR CHILDHOOD PET

22:10.430 --> 22:12.432
AND THE STREET YOU GREW UP ON,
AND VOILà!

22:12.432 --> 22:15.465
THAT'S THE NAME YOU'D USE
IF YOU WERE A PORN STAR.

22:15.465 --> 22:17.106
SO I'M THUNDER McFADDEN.

22:17.106 --> 22:19.509
MY BUDDY HERE IS
SNOOP WINDEMERE.

22:19.509 --> 22:21.771
MM.
 (chuckles)

22:21.771 --> 22:24.444
HEY, WHO WOULD YOU BE?

22:24.444 --> 22:26.676
ORSON, I'M PREPARING
A BUFFET FOR 200.

22:26.676 --> 22:28.678
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO EXPLORE

22:28.678 --> 22:31.521
MY HYPOTHETICAL CAREER
IN THE ADULT FILM INDUSTRY.

22:31.521 --> 22:34.353
FINE.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.356
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT'S
WHY PEOPLE FIND YOU SO RIGID,

22:37.356 --> 22:42.131
BECAUSE YOU CAN NEVER
JUST LET GO AND HAVE FUN.

22:42.131 --> 22:44.394
(sighs)

22:44.394 --> 22:46.996
COCO SAUGATUCK. HAPPY NOW?

22:46.996 --> 22:49.769
SURE AM.

22:49.769 --> 22:52.802
THANKS, HON.

22:52.802 --> 22:56.476
OF COURSE IT COULD JUST
AS EASILY BE MUNCHY CEDARHURST.
 WHAT?

22:56.476 --> 22:58.377
OR TAFFY SWALLOW.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.681
WE MOVED AROUND A LOT
AND HAD THREE DOGS.

23:01.681 --> 23:03.713
BREE, FOCUS.

23:03.713 --> 23:05.985
IT HAS TO BE
YOUR FAVORITE PET.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.588
LIKE IF I ASKED YOU,
"WHAT'S YOUR CHILDHOOD PET?"

23:08.588 --> 23:12.161
THIS IS THE ONE YOU'D SAY.
 WELL, I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE
A FAVORITE.

23:12.161 --> 23:15.495
I LOVED THEM ALL EQUALLY.
 OH, PLEASE. IF COCO,
TAFFY AND MUNCHY WERE

23:15.495 --> 23:19.769
IN A BURNING BUILDING
AND YOU COULD ONLY SAVE ONE...
 ORSON, WHY ARE YOU
BEING SO MORBID?

23:19.769 --> 23:22.532
NO. (chuckles) I-I JUST WANT
TO KNOW YOUR PORN NAME.

23:22.532 --> 23:24.033
OKAY, FINE.

23:24.033 --> 23:27.406
IF I HAD TO PICK A FAVORITE,
I GUESS IT WOULD BE MUNCHY.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.879
(chuckles)
SHE WAS A BIT RAMBUNCTIOUS.

23:29.879 --> 23:32.882
FATHER SENT HER TO A FARM
SO SHE'D HAVE ROOM TO RUN.

23:32.882 --> 23:35.485
I CRIED FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS.

23:35.485 --> 23:38.117
MUNCHY, HUH? THIS WAS FUN.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.793
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S
A LARGE MUSHROOM PEPPERONI PIZZA

23:43.793 --> 23:45.895
AND TWO SALADS.
I'LL GET THAT STARTED.

23:45.895 --> 23:49.499
TOM, I GOT NEED A LARGE--
 LARGE PEP/MUSH AT TABLE NINE.
I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

23:49.499 --> 23:51.731
THANKS. AND DO YOU HAVE
THE CALZONES FOR TABLE THREE?

23:51.731 --> 23:55.164
OH, CRAP.
 (groans) SWEETIE,
I NEED TWO DINNER SALADS.

23:55.164 --> 23:59.709
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
 PARKER SAID THE ONLY REASON
YOU HAD ME MAKE SALADS

23:59.709 --> 24:01.771
IS BECAUSE
IT'S A JOB FOR BABIES.

24:01.771 --> 24:04.614
WELL, CLEARLY, THAT'S NOT TRUE
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A BABY.

24:04.614 --> 24:08.618
YOU'RE 15, REMEMBER?
 ALSO, I CAN'T FIND
MY BAND-AID.

24:08.618 --> 24:12.181
OKAY, YOU FILL WATER GLASSES.
I'LL MAKE THE SALADS.

24:12.181 --> 24:14.223
HEY, MOM?
 YEAH?

24:14.223 --> 24:16.185
THIS IS FOR TABLE FIVE.

24:16.185 --> 24:17.787
OH, THANKS.

24:17.787 --> 24:18.958
YEAH.

24:18.958 --> 24:22.632
UH... YOU DIDN'T GIVE THEM
ENOUGH CHANGE.

24:22.632 --> 24:24.634
YEAH, I KNOW.
I FIGURED THIS OUT.

24:24.634 --> 24:27.166
YOU CAN SHORT PEOPLE 1%,
AND THEY WON'T EVEN NOTICE.

24:27.166 --> 24:31.901
IF THEY GOT A BUZZ ON, 3%.
 OKAY, YOU MAKE THE SALADS.
I'LL HANDLE THE REGISTER.

24:31.901 --> 24:34.844
(Preston) DUDE, BACK OFF.
THAT'S MY TABLE.

24:34.844 --> 24:37.146
NOT ANYMORE. YOU CAN TAKE
THE 4-TOP OF OLD FARTS.

24:37.146 --> 24:39.148
NO WAY. I--
 WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:39.148 --> 24:42.612
HE TOOK MY TABLE.
 SO? TAKE ANOTHER ONE.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

24:46.956 --> 24:50.259
WELL, SINCE I'M THE ONLY ONE
HERE WHO CAN WAIT ON THAT TABLE

24:50.259 --> 24:53.122
WITHOUT KNOCKING OVER A GLASS
WITH MY PANTS,

24:53.122 --> 24:55.164
HOW ABOUT I TAKE IT?

24:55.164 --> 24:58.267
YOU HANDLE THE CASH REGISTER.
YOU BUS TABLES. GO ON.

24:58.267 --> 25:00.229
WELL, LOOK AT THIS.

25:00.229 --> 25:02.532
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.

25:02.532 --> 25:04.033
THINGS ARE RUNNING SMOOTHLY.

25:04.033 --> 25:07.607
DON'T WORRY. I'M NOT GONNA SAY,
"I TOLD YOU SO."

25:10.209 --> 25:12.281
(knocks on door)

25:12.281 --> 25:14.784
HEY. KATHERINE SAID
YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME.

25:14.784 --> 25:17.016
YEAH. COME ON IN.
 (door closes)

25:17.016 --> 25:19.018
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HAVE
JUST CALLED.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.721
YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE HER
AS AN INTERMEDIARY.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.723
REALLY? I THOUGHT
WE WERE USING KATHERINE

25:23.723 --> 25:25.825
FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS--
SENDING MESSAGES,

25:25.825 --> 25:27.827
RAISING OUR KID.

25:27.827 --> 25:29.829
I DON'T SEE
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

25:29.829 --> 25:32.301
I HAVE TO WORK,
AND SHE HAS SOME FREE TIME.

25:32.301 --> 25:35.164
IT'S BETTER FOR EVERYBODY.
 WELL, IT'S NOT BETTER FOR ME,

25:35.164 --> 25:37.667
ESPECIALLY WHEN
I'M NOT EVEN TOLD ABOUT IT.

25:37.667 --> 25:40.009
FINE. HERE I AM TELLING YOU.

25:40.009 --> 25:42.041
I HAVE TO WORK FRIDAY,

25:42.041 --> 25:45.274
SO KATHERINE WILL BE
PICKING M.J. UP FROM SCHOOL.

25:45.274 --> 25:47.246
NO.

25:47.246 --> 25:50.179
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "NO"?

25:50.179 --> 25:52.882
LET ME REMIND YOU,
I HAVE CUSTODY ON FRIDAYS.

25:52.882 --> 25:54.884
HEY, THANKS.
LET ME REMIND YOU

25:54.884 --> 25:56.886
THAT THE REASON
I AGREED TO CUSTODY IS

25:56.886 --> 25:59.188
SO OUR SON COULD SPEND TIME
WITH HIS FATHER.

25:59.188 --> 26:01.961
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH KATHERINE?

26:01.961 --> 26:03.262
NO, SHE'S A PEACH,

26:03.262 --> 26:05.965
BUT SHE'S NOT THE ONE
THAT DRAGGED ME TO COURT

26:05.965 --> 26:08.567
TO HAMMER OUT
SOME CUSTODY AGREEMENT.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.640
NOW IF YOU'D LIKE,
WE CAN GO BACK,

26:10.640 --> 26:12.642
AND THE JUDGE
CAN EXPLAIN TO YOU

26:12.642 --> 26:16.305
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
 OKAY, YOU LISTEN TO ME.

26:16.305 --> 26:18.347
MOMMY?

26:18.347 --> 26:20.179
ARE YOU GUYS FIGHTING?

26:20.179 --> 26:22.351
NO, SWEETIE.

26:22.351 --> 26:26.686
WE ARE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU.

26:26.686 --> 26:29.358
(chuckles) AREN'T WE?

26:32.762 --> 26:34.764
I'LL SEE YOU FRIDAY, BUDDY.

26:34.764 --> 26:38.297
LOOKS LIKE I'LL BE
PICKING YOU UP FROM SCHOOL.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.329
(door opens and closes)

26:51.340 --> 26:53.883
ANDREW MAKES
TWICE AS MUCH AS ME?

26:53.883 --> 26:56.145
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

26:56.145 --> 26:57.647
A LITTLE BIRD

26:57.647 --> 27:01.220
OR SHOULD I SAY
A LITTLE DOG NAMED MUNCHY?

27:01.220 --> 27:04.724
THAT'S WHY YOU WANTED TO KNOW
THE NAMES OF MY PETS?

27:04.724 --> 27:06.896
ORSON HODGE,
YOU ARE SHAMEFUL.

27:06.896 --> 27:09.198
WHAT'S SHAMEFUL IS
HOW MUCH YOU'RE PAYING HIM.

27:09.198 --> 27:12.201
ANDREW HAS BEEN WITH ME
SINCE I LAUNCHED THE COMPANY.

27:12.201 --> 27:14.163
HE RUNS EVERY ASPECT
OF THE BUSINESS.

27:14.163 --> 27:17.266
HE DESERVES WHAT HE'S MAKING.
 BUT I AM YOUR HUSBAND,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

27:17.266 --> 27:21.270
YES, ORSON, WE'RE ALL AWARE
OF HOW YOU GOT THE JOB.

27:21.270 --> 27:23.272
YOU KNOW
WHAT THE REAL TRAVESTY IS?

27:23.272 --> 27:26.075
I'M MORE EDUCATED
THAN THE LOT OF YOU.

27:26.075 --> 27:29.078
I WENT TO GRAD SCHOOL.
I'M A DENTIST.
 NO, YOU WERE A DENTIST.

27:29.078 --> 27:31.380
NOW YOU'RE A CATERER,
AND YOU'RE PAID FAIRLY

27:31.380 --> 27:33.422
BASED ON YOUR EXPERTISE
AND CONTRIBUTION.

27:33.422 --> 27:36.355
OH, THIS IS NOT ABOUT MONEY,
BREE. IT'S ABOUT VALUE.

27:36.355 --> 27:38.357
AND YOU'RE SAYING
I'M WORTHLESS.

27:38.357 --> 27:41.390
NO, I'M JUST SAYING
YOU'RE WORTH... LESS.

27:41.390 --> 27:43.733
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

27:43.733 --> 27:46.035
I'M JUST BEING HONEST.

27:47.336 --> 27:49.238
VERY WELL.

27:50.900 --> 27:54.844
OH, SINCE WE'RE BEING HONEST,
MUNCHY DIDN'T GO TO ANY FARM.

27:54.844 --> 27:56.846
THAT'S WHAT PARENTS
TELL THEIR KIDS

27:56.846 --> 27:59.078
WHEN THEY JUST HAD THEIR PETS
GASSED.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.786
HEY.

28:06.786 --> 28:10.790
HI. YOU GOT A MINUTE? I HAVE
A REALLY BIG FAVOR TO ASK YOU.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.461
UH, SURE.

28:12.461 --> 28:15.825
I NEED
A LITTLE DETECTIVE WORK DONE.

28:15.825 --> 28:17.266
IT'S ABOUT BRADLEY.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.771
(sighs) SO...

28:21.771 --> 28:24.303
WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:24.303 --> 28:26.435
I'M GONNA BUY A GOLF CLUB.

28:26.435 --> 28:30.339
A BASEBALL BAT
WOULD BE CHEAPER.

28:30.339 --> 28:33.112
MAYBE I SHOULD
LET YOU FINISH.

28:33.112 --> 28:35.244
SEE, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT GOLF CLUBS,

28:35.244 --> 28:37.316
BUT I KNOW CARLOS DOES,

28:37.316 --> 28:39.318
SO I WAS HOPING YOU GUYS
COULD SNOOP AROUND

28:39.318 --> 28:42.251
AND FIND OUT
WHAT KIND OF DRIVER BRAD WANTS.

28:42.251 --> 28:44.323
OH, IT'S A GIFT.

28:44.323 --> 28:45.825
SURE, YEAH.

28:45.825 --> 28:48.327
WE'D LOVE TO HELP OUT.
(chuckles)

28:48.327 --> 28:50.860
SO WHAT'S THE OCCASION?
 NO OCCASION.

28:50.860 --> 28:53.732
I JUST WANT TO THANK HIM
FOR BEING A WONDERFUL HUSBAND.

28:53.732 --> 28:58.167
WELL, DON'T SPEND TOO MUCH.
(chuckles)

28:58.167 --> 29:00.339
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GET HIM A CARD?

29:00.339 --> 29:03.342
SO OUR MARRIAGE COUNSELOR SAID
WE SHOULD GET EACH OTHER

29:03.342 --> 29:05.845
LITTLE GIFTS NOW AND THEN
TO KEEP THINGS SPONTANEOUS.

29:05.845 --> 29:08.277
OH, YOU'RE IN COUNSELING.
THAT'S GREAT.

29:08.277 --> 29:11.280
WE WERE, BUT WE STOPPED.
WE DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.453
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
 YEAH. BRAD AND I ARE SOLID.

29:14.453 --> 29:17.186
WELL, ICE IS SOLID, TOO,

29:17.186 --> 29:20.359
UNTIL IT CRACKS AND YOU'RE
DROWNING IN FREEZING WATER.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.892
I'D STAY IN COUNSELING
IF I WERE YOU.

29:22.892 --> 29:25.895
GABY, I'M HOME! CAN YOU COME
IN HERE FOR A MINUTE?

29:25.895 --> 29:29.198
(groans)

29:29.198 --> 29:31.500
BRAD GIVES ME A HUGE BONUS
AND YOU REPAY HIM

29:31.500 --> 29:34.503
BY TELLING HIS WIFE THAT
THEY NEED MARRIAGE COUNSELING?

29:34.503 --> 29:36.806
I'M SORRY. I THINK THEY DO.

29:36.806 --> 29:38.808
THEIR MARRIAGE IS
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

29:38.808 --> 29:41.811
BESIDES, I THINK
THEY'RE A VERY HAPPY COUPLE.
 WHO? HIM AND MARIA

29:41.811 --> 29:46.555
OR HIM AND THE BLONDE
I SAW HIM KISSING YESTERDAY?
 WHAT? NO WAY!

29:46.555 --> 29:48.888
YEAH. AND BRAD SAW ME.

29:48.888 --> 29:51.120
WHY DO YOU THINK
YOUR BONUS JUMPED

29:51.120 --> 29:54.093
FROM A STUFFED CHICKEN BREAST
TO 30 GRAND IN A DAY?

29:54.093 --> 29:57.366
(laughs)

30:01.330 --> 30:03.933
OH, MY GOD.

30:03.933 --> 30:05.804
THIS IS ILLEGAL.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.938
I'M GETTING A BONUS NO ONE ELSE
IS GETTING BASED ON BLACKMAIL.

30:08.938 --> 30:10.209
YOU'RE WELCOME.

30:10.209 --> 30:13.542
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS.

30:13.542 --> 30:16.345
WELL, THANK GOD
YOU CAME TO YOUR SENSES.

30:16.345 --> 30:18.517
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET IN THERE
AND TELL HER.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.891
NO, WE CAN'T TELL HER. WE'D HAVE
TO GIVE THE MONEY BACK.

30:21.891 --> 30:24.994
DON'T WE HAVE A MORAL
RESPONSIBILITY TO TELL HER?

30:24.994 --> 30:26.295
IT'S LIKE YOU SAID--

30:26.295 --> 30:28.427
THEIR MARRIAGE IS
NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.299
HE'S THE ONE WHO'S CHEATING.

30:30.299 --> 30:33.963
IF WE SAY ANYTHING,
IT'LL JUST MAKE THINGS WORSE.

30:33.963 --> 30:35.965
WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS HERE,
CARLOS.

30:35.965 --> 30:38.908
REALLY? 'CAUSE IT SURE
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT.

30:45.344 --> 30:48.347
(Katherine) IT'S OPEN.

30:48.347 --> 30:51.350
SUSAN, YOU GOT OUR MESSAGE.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.352
YES,
AND IMAGINE MY SURPRISE,

30:53.352 --> 30:55.354
'CAUSE THE LAST TIME
I TALKED TO MIKE,

30:55.354 --> 30:58.287
HE PROMISED ME HE WAS
PICKING UP M.J. FROM SCHOOL.

30:58.287 --> 31:00.359
OH, MRS. NELSON HAD
ANOTHER PLUMBING EMERGENCY.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.332
APPARENTLY THIS
NEW OAT BRAN DIET SHE'S ON--

31:03.332 --> 31:06.295
I DON'T NEED THE DETAILS.
I HAD A LONG DAY.

31:06.295 --> 31:08.297
I JUST WANT
TO PICK UP MY KID.

31:08.297 --> 31:12.301
MOMMY, WE HAD PANINIS
FOR DINNER. YOU WANT ONE?

31:12.301 --> 31:15.004
NO, THANK YOU. LET'S GO.

31:15.004 --> 31:17.306
BUT WE WERE GONNA MAKE BROWNIES
FOR DESSERT.

31:17.306 --> 31:19.308
BUT WE CAN MAKE BROWNIES
AT HOME.

31:19.308 --> 31:23.913
THE BOX KIND? KATHERINE SAYS
THOSE AREN'T REAL BROWNIES.

31:23.913 --> 31:28.617
EXCEPT WHEN YOUR MOMMY
MAKES THEM WITH LOVE.

31:28.617 --> 31:30.359
(chuckles)

31:30.359 --> 31:32.461
GOOD SAVE.

31:32.461 --> 31:34.093
LET'S GO.

31:36.425 --> 31:37.896
SUSAN?

31:37.896 --> 31:40.229
LOOK,

31:40.229 --> 31:43.232
I KNOW YOU WERE SURPRISED
TO FIND M.J. HERE AGAIN TODAY,

31:43.232 --> 31:45.904
BUT I REALLY WAS TRYING
TO DO YOU A FAVOR.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.906
WELL, I DON'T NEED YOU
TO DO ME ANY FAVORS.

31:47.906 --> 31:51.140
WHAT I NEED IS FOR EVERYONE
TO JUST STICK TO THE PLAN.

31:51.140 --> 31:53.142
MONDAY, WEDNESDAY, FRIDAY--
MIKE WATCHES HIS SON.

31:53.142 --> 31:56.215
HE DOESN'T PAWN HIM OFF
ON HIS GIRLFRIEND.

31:56.215 --> 31:57.616
(scoffs)

31:57.616 --> 32:02.051
I HAD A REALLY FUN TIME.

32:04.393 --> 32:08.157
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

32:15.364 --> 32:18.237
(indistinct conversations)

32:18.237 --> 32:19.538
(laughter)

32:19.538 --> 32:23.272
BIG GROUP COMING IN. IT IS
NOW OFFICIALLY SATURDAY NIGHT.

32:23.272 --> 32:25.014
FINALLY.

32:25.014 --> 32:27.376
(indistinct conversations)

32:27.376 --> 32:29.318
OH, GREAT. THEY'RE KIDS.

32:29.318 --> 32:32.321
1 PLATE OF SPAGHETTI
AND 15 BASKETS OF FREE BREAD.
 STOP BEING SUCH A DOWNER.

32:32.321 --> 32:34.383
WE'RE FINALLY MAKING A GO
OF THIS PLACE.

32:34.383 --> 32:37.286
ALL YOU WANT TO DO
IS COMPLAIN.
 (scoffs)

32:37.286 --> 32:40.559
WE'RE TAKING A BREAK.
 N-NOT NOW.
WE JUST GOT A BIG PARTY.

32:40.559 --> 32:43.362
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
WE'RE OUTTA HERE.

32:46.335 --> 32:49.468
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

32:49.468 --> 32:52.741
THOSE KIDS GO OUR SCHOOL.
 AND YOU KNOW
WHO THAT BIG GUY IS?

32:52.741 --> 32:55.744
KEVIN McDERMOTT. THE GUY
CALLED ME "JESUS" FOR A YEAR

32:55.744 --> 32:57.376
'CAUSE I WORE SANDALS ONE DAY.

32:57.376 --> 33:01.080
IF HE SEES ME WEARING THIS,
I'LL NEVER HEAR THE END OF IT.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.482
FINE. DON'T WEAR THAT APRON.
THAT'S...
 NO, I'M NOT WAITING

33:03.482 --> 33:06.515
ON A KID WHO'S GONNA MAKE FUN
OF ME ON MONDAY MORNING.

33:06.515 --> 33:09.018
IT'S HUMILIATING ENOUGH
HAVING TO WORK HERE.
 HUMILIATING?

33:09.018 --> 33:11.520
GUYS, EASY.
 NO, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE NOT HUMILIATED

33:11.520 --> 33:13.522
WHEN YOU USE THE MONEY
THAT WE MAKE HERE

33:13.522 --> 33:16.525
TO BUY YOUR CLOTHES.
 TOM, IT'S FINE.
I'LL TAKE THE TABLE.

33:16.525 --> 33:18.627
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOUR MOTHER CAN'T WAIT

33:18.627 --> 33:21.630
ON THIS WHOLE RESTAURANT
BY HERSELF.
 WELL, THEN YOU DO IT.

33:21.630 --> 33:24.203
PORTER, I'M YOUR FATHER
AND YOUR BOSS,

33:24.203 --> 33:28.437
AND I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW
TO GO TAKE THAT TABLE.

33:28.437 --> 33:31.480
OR WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA FIRE ME?
GO FOR IT.

33:31.480 --> 33:33.011
(Lynette gasps)

33:33.011 --> 33:36.145
YOU THINK THIS IS A JOKE?
THIS IS MY LIFE!

33:36.145 --> 33:38.787
TOM!
 YOU WORRY ABOUT
BEING EMBARRASSED?

33:38.787 --> 33:42.251
I HAVE PUT EVERYTHING I HAVE
INTO THIS RESTAURANT!
 ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH!

33:42.251 --> 33:46.425
LET GO OF HIM! LET GO OF HIM!
LET GO OF HIM!

33:46.425 --> 33:48.397
GUYS?

33:50.559 --> 33:54.533
I JUST SAT A 12-TOP.
WHO'S TAKING IT?

33:54.533 --> 33:58.337
(sighs)

33:58.337 --> 34:00.209
I WILL.

34:16.425 --> 34:19.428
(siren wailing in distance)

34:30.139 --> 34:32.571
I STARTED GETTING OUR ACCOUNTS
IN ORDER.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.643
IF WE'RE GONNA SELL
THIS PLACE,

34:34.643 --> 34:37.476
WE SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW EXACTLY
HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH.

35:05.574 --> 35:09.638
I THINK THIS CAN ALL WAIT
UNTIL MORNING.

35:09.638 --> 35:11.510
DON'T YOU?

35:36.735 --> 35:39.438
HEY. I JUST BOOKED US
INTO THE BRUNSWICK INN

35:39.438 --> 35:41.440
FOR THIS WEEKEND.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.471
GREAT.

35:42.471 --> 35:44.643
(singsongy)
PREPARE TO BE PAMPERED!

35:44.643 --> 35:46.445
OH, SHOOT.

35:46.445 --> 35:48.447
THIS WEEKEND
ISN'T GONNA WORK.

35:48.447 --> 35:50.749
MIKE REALLY WANTS US
TO DO THAT CAMPING TRIP

35:50.749 --> 35:52.751
THAT WE'VE
BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

35:52.751 --> 35:55.554
(scoffs)
CAMPING? HAVE YOU MET ME?

35:55.554 --> 35:57.556
I FIGURED
YOU WERE GONNA SAY THAT.

35:57.556 --> 35:59.558
I JUST CAN'T BLOW HIM OFF.

35:59.558 --> 36:02.491
THIS IS THE ONLY WEEKEND
THAT WORKS FOR HIM.

36:02.491 --> 36:04.493
THEN YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

36:04.493 --> 36:07.896
HAVE FUN WIPING WITH LEAVES.
 OH, EDIE?

36:07.896 --> 36:11.470
PLEASE DON'T TELL KATHERINE
THAT YOU'RE NOT COMING.

36:11.470 --> 36:13.442
ALL RIGHT?
MIKE REALLY WANTS HER THERE,

36:13.442 --> 36:16.575
AND IF SHE HEARS THAT YOU'RE
NOT GOING, SHE WON'T EITHER.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.747
WILL YOU TAKE ME

36:18.747 --> 36:20.749
TO THE BRUNSWICK INN
NEXT WEEKEND?

36:20.749 --> 36:22.911
YES.

36:22.911 --> 36:26.655
THEN I WON'T SAY A WORD
TO KATHERINE.

36:38.267 --> 36:40.599
(beep)

36:43.302 --> 36:44.603
(beep)

36:48.737 --> 36:51.540
HEY.
WHEN DID YOU TWO GET HERE?

36:51.540 --> 36:53.211
JUST A MINUTE AGO.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.213
THEY SAID THEY HAVE
SOMETHING PERSONAL

36:55.213 --> 36:57.215
THEY WANT
TO TALK TO US ABOUT.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.618
OH, REALLY? WHAT IS IT?

37:01.450 --> 37:03.252
WE'RE PREGNANT.

37:03.252 --> 37:04.593
(Maria laughs)

37:04.593 --> 37:06.255
OH, WOW.

37:06.255 --> 37:08.397
(flatly) YAY!

37:08.397 --> 37:10.559
I KNOW. WE ARE SO HAPPY.

37:10.559 --> 37:12.461
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

37:15.264 --> 37:17.466
SEE, EVEN THOUGH

37:17.466 --> 37:19.968
WE'VE ONLY KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR A SHORT TIME,

37:19.968 --> 37:21.970
YOUR FRIENDSHIP
HAS MEANT A LOT TO US,

37:21.970 --> 37:23.972
WHICH IS WHY
MARIA FEELS STRONGLY

37:23.972 --> 37:28.246
THAT YOU SHOULD BE
THE BABY'S GODPARENTS.

37:28.246 --> 37:31.280
DO YOU HEAR THAT, CARLOS?

37:31.280 --> 37:33.482
GODPARENTS.

37:33.482 --> 37:35.554
YAY!

37:35.554 --> 37:37.826
YOU ARE SUCH GOOD PEOPLE,
SO KINDHEARTED AND DECENT,

37:37.826 --> 37:39.828
AND THAT IS
THE KIND OF INFLUENCE

37:39.828 --> 37:43.632
THAT WE WANT
IN OUR BABY'S LIFE.

37:43.632 --> 37:45.834
HOW COULD WE SAY NO?
(chuckles nervously)

37:45.834 --> 37:47.466
(laughs)

37:47.466 --> 37:49.267
OH!

37:49.267 --> 37:51.640
OH!

37:51.640 --> 37:54.503
OH. I SEE YOU GOT YOUR BRACELET
AFTER ALL.

37:54.503 --> 37:55.904
OH, YEAH.

37:55.904 --> 38:00.409
UH, BUT I'M NOT ENJOYING IT
AS MUCH AS I THOUGHT I WOULD.

38:10.058 --> 38:12.961
OKAY, LUNCH AND A MOVIE.
YOU ARE ONE LUCKY BOY.

38:12.961 --> 38:14.923
I'M GONNA TAKE
A QUICK SHOWER.

38:14.923 --> 38:18.627
TRY NOT TO GET ANY CRUMBS
ON THE COUCH.

38:18.627 --> 38:19.928
WHAT'S WRONG?

38:19.928 --> 38:21.970
IT'S PEANUT BUTTER,
NO CRUSTS--

38:21.970 --> 38:23.902
YOUR FAVORITE.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.804
I WANT A PANINI.

38:25.804 --> 38:29.378
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE PANINIS.

38:29.378 --> 38:31.380
IT'S JUST TURKEY AND CHEESE.

38:31.380 --> 38:33.442
DO WE HAVE ANY PROVOLONE?

38:33.442 --> 38:37.916
NO, WE DO NOT HAVE
ANY PROVOLONE.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.489
CAN WE BORROW SOME
FROM KATHERINE?

38:40.489 --> 38:42.951
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

38:42.951 --> 38:45.724
IN THIS HOUSE, WE DO NOT EAT
PRETENTIOUS CHEESES.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.926
WE EAT
HONEST AMERICAN PEANUT BUTTER.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.359
NOW WATCH YOUR MOVIE,

38:50.359 --> 38:52.831
AND I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.471
WILL YOU MAKE ME A PANINI?

39:02.471 --> 39:05.514
UH, WELL, SURE, SWEETIE.

39:05.514 --> 39:07.616
DOES YOUR MOMMY
KNOW YOU'RE HERE?

39:09.548 --> 39:12.521
HEY, SWEETIE.
HOW WAS YOUR SANDWICH?

39:14.423 --> 39:15.684
M.J.?

39:15.684 --> 39:19.528
M.J., HONEY, WHERE ARE YOU?

39:19.528 --> 39:23.832
M.J., WHERE ARE YOU?!

39:23.832 --> 39:27.466
M.J.!

39:28.867 --> 39:31.039
M.J.!

39:42.911 --> 39:45.614
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

39:45.614 --> 39:47.756
HE WANTED A PANINI,
SAID YOU KNEW.

39:47.756 --> 39:50.619
M.J., GO WAIT
OUTSIDE ON THE PORCH.

39:50.619 --> 39:52.621
I NEED TO TALK
TO KATHERINE.

39:56.525 --> 39:58.497
YOU CAN TAKE THE SANDWICH.

40:01.700 --> 40:04.633
LOOK, HE SHOWED UP
ON MY DOORSTEP.

40:04.633 --> 40:05.934
HE SEEMED HUNGRY.

40:05.934 --> 40:08.477
YOU THINK
I DON'T FEED MY KID?

40:08.477 --> 40:11.710
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE HE JUST
WANTED TO COME SEE ME.

40:11.710 --> 40:14.613
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU MAKE IT
LIKE DISNEYLAND OVER HERE,

40:14.613 --> 40:16.715
WITH YOUR PANINIS
AND YOUR BLACKJACK.

40:16.715 --> 40:19.488
YOU'RE TRYING
TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN

40:19.488 --> 40:23.452
TO MAKE HIM THINK
THAT YOU'RE THE OTHER MOMMY.
 WHAT?

40:23.452 --> 40:25.754
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET YOUR HOOKS
DEEPER INTO MIKE

40:25.754 --> 40:28.757
BY SHOWING HIM
HOW MUCH HIS SON LOVES YOU.
 SUSAN, I AM BEING NICE

40:28.757 --> 40:31.129
TO THE CHILD
OF THE MAN I'M DATING.

40:31.129 --> 40:34.833
HOW DOES THAT MAKE ME EVIL?
 NO, NOT EVIL. DEVIOUS.

40:34.833 --> 40:37.536
(scoffs)
 WELL, YOU KNOW,
I HATE TO TELL YOU,

40:37.536 --> 40:39.538
BUT YOUR BIG PLAN IS
NOT GONNA WORK,

40:39.538 --> 40:43.071
'CAUSE FROM NOW ON, M.J. IS
EITHER AT MY HOUSE OR MIKE'S.

40:43.071 --> 40:46.575
HE IS NO LONGER ALLOWED
TO BE HERE.
 YEAH, UH,
THAT'S GONNA BE TRICKY.

40:46.575 --> 40:49.878
WELL, THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GONNA
BE, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

40:49.878 --> 40:53.181
NO, IT'S GONNA BE TRICKY
BECAUSE MIKE'S MOVING IN HERE.

40:53.181 --> 40:55.584
WHAT?

40:55.584 --> 40:57.085
FIRST OF THE MONTH,

40:57.085 --> 41:00.088
HE'S GIVING UP HIS PLACE
AND MOVING IN WITH ME.

41:00.088 --> 41:04.663
SO M.J. IS GOING TO BE
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME HERE,

41:04.663 --> 41:06.865
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.672
(indistinct conversations)

41:13.672 --> 41:15.674
ORSON,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.676
I WAS DOING A RECOUNT
OF THE GOBLETS

41:17.676 --> 41:19.678
FOR THE HOPKINS
WEDDING RECEPTION,

41:19.678 --> 41:21.680
AND WE'RE SHORT BY ABOUT 30...
 OH.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.482
SO I HAVE TO RUN OVER
TO THE SUPPLIER

41:24.482 --> 41:27.786
AND PICK UP THE REST. COULD YOU
HOLD DOWN THE FORT FOR ME?
 SURE. NO PROBLEM.

41:27.786 --> 41:30.789
THANKS.
 HEY, YOU KNOW, ANDREW? IT NEVER
WOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO ME

41:30.789 --> 41:32.791
TO DO A RECOUNT
OF THE GOBLETS.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.492
BREE'S LUCKY TO HAVE

41:34.492 --> 41:37.596
SOMEONE AS CONSCIENTIOUS
AS YOU WORKING HERE.

41:37.596 --> 41:39.598
WOW. (chuckles)
THANK YOU, ORSON.

41:39.598 --> 41:43.101
THAT--
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

41:43.101 --> 41:45.103
(door opens and closes)

42:02.120 --> 42:06.294
IT BEGINS JUST AFTER SUNRISE.

42:06.294 --> 42:08.697
AFTER A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP,

42:08.697 --> 42:12.761
PEOPLE LEAVE THEIR HOMES
TO GO TO WORK.

42:12.761 --> 42:15.163
THEY DO THIS
SO THEY CAN PROVIDE

42:15.163 --> 42:19.107
A BETTER LIFE
FOR THEIR FAMILIES...

42:19.107 --> 42:24.042
AFFORD TO BUY NICE THINGS...

42:24.042 --> 42:28.076
AND HAVE A REASON
TO GET UP IN THE MORNING.

42:29.718 --> 42:31.580
(keys jingle)

42:31.580 --> 42:34.552
AND WHEN THEIR EXHAUSTING WORK
IS DONE,

42:34.552 --> 42:37.025
PEOPLE COME BACK HOME AGAIN...

42:39.588 --> 42:42.591
AND SOME
BEGIN COUNTING THE DAYS...

42:42.591 --> 42:43.592
(opens zipper)

42:43.592 --> 42:48.667
TILL THEIR NEXT VACATION.
