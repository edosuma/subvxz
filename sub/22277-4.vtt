00:06.700 --> 00:09.067
NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero.

00:09.100 --> 00:10.600
SUE: This is gonna
collapse on me.

00:10.633 --> 00:12.267
This whole shelf is moving.

00:12.300 --> 00:15.533
NARRATOR:
Mother nature wreaks havoc
on plans in the Alaska bush.

00:15.567 --> 00:17.067
ANDY: I just want to get
my fucking boat back

00:17.100 --> 00:19.167
before it ends up down
in fucking circles.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.000
A scout into the tundra brings
unexpected dangers.

00:22.033 --> 00:26.067
SUE: Is it possible that it
comes down and kills me?
Absolutely.

00:26.100 --> 00:28.233
NARRATOR: Costly mistakes
must be paid for.

00:28.267 --> 00:30.200
ANDY: This boat that I lost
last night

00:30.233 --> 00:32.200
is critical to everything
I'm doing this summer.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.767
NARRATOR:
The quest for food is a life
and death struggle.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.233
GLENN: Oh, Jesus.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.567
NARRATOR:
And simple chores turn into
desperate missions.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.833
If I don't come home
with five poles,
she ain't going to be happy.

00:52.700 --> 00:55.033
ANDY: The Yukon River
is our highway.

00:55.067 --> 00:58.233
In the summer months
I use boats everyday
on the Yukon.

00:58.267 --> 00:59.400
I do a lot of freighting.

00:59.433 --> 01:02.300
Large loads, unorthodox loads.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.667
Having boats to work with

01:03.700 --> 01:06.167
is critical to the way
we live down here.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.567
You gotta be fucking
kidding, man.

01:10.033 --> 01:11.167
(SIGHS)

01:11.200 --> 01:13.067
Un-fucking-believable.

01:14.267 --> 01:16.233
I just came down here
and my boat

01:16.267 --> 01:18.667
that had a tank of water in it
isn't here,

01:18.700 --> 01:20.700
it look like the stake...

01:20.733 --> 01:23.567
The stake pulled out
and it drifted off

01:23.600 --> 01:25.933
is what it looks like to me...

01:25.967 --> 01:28.667
And so I gotta go
track down a boat.

01:30.033 --> 01:33.233
NARRATOR:
With currents ripping through
at up to 10 mph,

01:33.267 --> 01:36.933
the boat can be anywhere
along the vast Yukon.

01:36.967 --> 01:38.367
I just want to get
fucking down river

01:38.400 --> 01:40.433
so I can get my fucking boat
back right here

01:40.467 --> 01:43.100
before it ends up down
in fucking circle.

01:43.133 --> 01:45.233
It could be 100 miles
down river at this point.

01:45.267 --> 01:47.433
I don't know when it got lost
or when it came out.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.600
-Kate, where's Iceberg?
-I don't know.

01:50.633 --> 01:51.833
Iceberg!

01:51.867 --> 01:53.367
Iceberg, come!

01:53.833 --> 01:55.167
Up, up.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.467
Good boy.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.133
I don't know when
I'll be back, Kate.

02:01.167 --> 02:03.333
I know, good luck.

02:03.367 --> 02:04.833
I hoping it got caught
in an eddy

02:04.867 --> 02:06.033
but I have no fucking idea.

02:07.433 --> 02:10.733
Hey, I love you.
Try not to get too worked up.

02:10.767 --> 02:12.000
You'll find it.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.433
My heart breaks for him,
honest to God.

02:19.467 --> 02:21.000
It seems like
every single time

02:21.033 --> 02:23.167
we have something to do
things back fire,

02:23.200 --> 02:25.167
like something else comes up,
something breaks.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.900
You gotta fix it, you gotta do

02:26.933 --> 02:29.367
20 steps before you can get
to the original one.

02:30.767 --> 02:34.767
Losing that boat
and the huge water tank
is a lot of money.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.833
Going to look for it
is a lot of time.

02:38.100 --> 02:41.967
Money and time are two things
we just don't have enough of.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.200
Last time this happened,
my boat almost drifted almost
70 miles downriver.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.067
That was on a windy day
when I would've expected

02:50.100 --> 02:52.100
the wind to ground it
on the shoreline.

02:53.233 --> 02:54.800
It wasn't windy at all
last night,

02:54.833 --> 02:57.633
so I have no idea how far this
boat can drift

02:57.667 --> 02:59.500
before it's gonna go aground.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.767
NARRATOR: Not only is the boat
worth thousands of dollars,

03:04.800 --> 03:07.400
it is also carrying 300
gallons of fresh water

03:07.433 --> 03:10.067
that Andy collected
from a creek just yesterday.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.933
ANDY: In the wintertime,
the Yukon River

03:13.967 --> 03:16.033
flows clear under the ice

03:16.067 --> 03:19.200
and so we're able to drill
holes and scoop out water

03:19.233 --> 03:21.133
and haul it up to the house
with buckets.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.067
However, in the summertime,

03:23.100 --> 03:27.400
a great deal of silt comes out
of the glacial streams
from the mountain range

03:27.433 --> 03:30.800
and that puts a tremendous
volume of silt into the Yukon.

03:30.833 --> 03:35.567
Right now,
there's about 2.2 tons of silt
going by per second.

03:35.600 --> 03:40.467
So it makes the water
un-potable for human drinking.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.200
That forces us to go up river

03:42.233 --> 03:44.933
and get clear water
out of a clear stream.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.333
If I don't have that boat,

03:47.367 --> 03:50.333
water doesn't get hauled,
my gravel doesn't get hauled.

03:50.367 --> 03:52.133
My house doesn't get built.

03:52.167 --> 03:55.833
So, it's a pretty essential
part of my whole plan
for the summer.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.400
I can't afford to lose a boat.

04:02.233 --> 04:04.433
GLENN: It's really
a hungry country up here.

04:04.467 --> 04:06.400
Especially in the summer.

04:06.433 --> 04:08.867
Not a lot to eat when
the caribou aren't around.

04:18.567 --> 04:21.733
Summer is really
the hardest time of the year
for me living out here.

04:21.767 --> 04:23.300
'Cause you really can't
live off the country

04:23.333 --> 04:25.033
as easily as you can
the rest of the year.

04:25.067 --> 04:26.267
(CHOPPING WOOD)

04:27.367 --> 04:29.033
In the winter
it can be a lot easier.

04:29.067 --> 04:30.933
You can shoot 5 caribou
in one day.

04:30.967 --> 04:33.733
And I'm all set for 5 months.

04:33.767 --> 04:35.833
At this time of year
there are no caribou around.

04:35.867 --> 04:37.367
There's no trapping
in the summer,

04:37.400 --> 04:39.867
there's no big game hunting
in the summer.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.067
And even if it were,

04:41.100 --> 04:43.633
I could never process
that much meat fast enough

04:43.667 --> 04:45.300
before maggots
had eaten it up.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.433
There are things that you can
get out here for food

04:50.467 --> 04:51.933
like fish is one,

04:51.967 --> 04:54.267
but it's a lot more
labour intensive.

04:54.300 --> 04:58.000
You spend as much energy
getting half a dozen fish
out here

04:58.033 --> 05:00.267
as you can spend
getting one caribou.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.000
Those half a dozen fish
will be gone in 2 days

05:03.033 --> 05:05.133
and that caribou
will last a month.

05:05.167 --> 05:09.333
I only want to catch
a few fish at a time in order
to just eat fresh.

05:09.367 --> 05:10.900
I don't want to get into
drying fish

05:10.933 --> 05:12.600
or trying to preserve them.

05:12.633 --> 05:14.167
In the summertime,

05:14.200 --> 05:16.600
it's a lot harder to preserve
food out here.

05:16.633 --> 05:20.100
So you're out there at least
every couple days looking
for something to eat.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.900
I'm running low on food

05:25.933 --> 05:27.733
and I haven't eaten yet today.

05:27.767 --> 05:29.367
So I'm going to go out
looking for some grayling

05:29.400 --> 05:30.967
in a creek that flows out
of the lake here.

05:31.533 --> 05:32.733
It's close to camp

05:32.767 --> 05:35.000
so I'm looking for something
to eat this time of year,

05:35.033 --> 05:36.567
that's one of the first places
I'll go.

05:43.467 --> 05:45.267
The mosquitoes make
everything more difficult,

05:45.300 --> 05:46.767
just about every job you do.

05:49.667 --> 05:52.267
Anything you want to do
with your hands,
you can't wear gloves.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.833
Mosquitoes are all over you.

05:54.867 --> 05:58.133
I got about 15 mosquitoes
in one swat.

05:58.167 --> 06:01.200
You gotta urinate,
you got mosquitoes biting you.

06:01.233 --> 06:02.767
I don't like to use
insect repellent,

06:02.800 --> 06:05.133
I don't like putting that
chemical on me every day.

06:05.167 --> 06:07.367
But you can cover up,
but it's hot...

06:07.400 --> 06:09.933
You don't want to be wearing
long sleeves today.

06:09.967 --> 06:12.900
If it wasn't for these
mosquitoes,
I'd be running around naked.

06:12.933 --> 06:15.267
It's all part of nature,
you gotta live with it.

06:15.300 --> 06:16.900
But it's no fun.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.700
CHIP: We basically
use the knowledge

06:19.733 --> 06:22.100
that people around here have
had for the last 10,000 years

06:22.133 --> 06:24.133
and we make a good living.

06:33.433 --> 06:35.200
Pass me the anchor.

06:35.233 --> 06:39.300
This is what's gonna hold
the whole net out there.

06:39.333 --> 06:40.567
NARRATOR: Every year,

06:40.600 --> 06:42.433
the Hailstones
head to their camp

06:42.467 --> 06:44.700
26 miles west of Noorvik

06:44.733 --> 06:46.100
to stock up enough fish

06:46.133 --> 06:48.600
to survive the brutal
months ahead.

06:48.633 --> 06:51.067
AGNES: We're here
at the lower camp.

06:51.100 --> 06:55.567
This is where we usually come
and put our white fishnets
at this time of the year.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.967
Right now, while I'm doing
the fishing,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.667
Chip's out getting poles
looking for firewood.

07:00.700 --> 07:02.700
When he's back with
a load of wood,

07:02.733 --> 07:05.200
then he'll put me up
a fish rack.

07:05.233 --> 07:07.200
We're gonna leave the two
little girls right here

07:07.233 --> 07:08.300
to watch us do this.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.600
Um, Idi is gonna be
driving and

07:10.633 --> 07:12.667
it's pretty much
just going in reverse

07:12.700 --> 07:15.800
so she's going to be practise
her reversing skills.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.500
Right, Idi?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.233
NARRATOR: In traditional
Inupiat villages

07:23.267 --> 07:25.033
women are in charge
of the fishing.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.833
It's crucial that Agnes'
daughters learn the skill

07:28.867 --> 07:31.533
if they are going to survive
this way of life.

07:31.567 --> 07:34.000
AGNES: It's important
for me to continue

07:34.033 --> 07:38.467
the subsistence living in
the traditional ways
with my daughters.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.167
Idi, look, do you see that
sandbar right there?

07:41.200 --> 07:43.267
Just try to aim towards
that sandbar.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.300
Stop, Idi.

07:48.333 --> 07:50.800
Watch where you're going,
watch where you are going.

07:50.833 --> 07:54.100
You gotta make it real tight
so the anchor will hook

07:54.133 --> 07:56.233
when I let it go
straight there.

07:58.467 --> 07:59.767
And when you
let go of your anchor,

07:59.800 --> 08:01.167
you make sure
your anchor is like this

08:01.200 --> 08:03.067
and it's not going to
get caught to nothing and

08:03.100 --> 08:04.500
let it go!

08:06.333 --> 08:09.000
Oh, yeah. Watch it sink.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.533
Forward, Idi.

08:14.967 --> 08:17.367
If we make sure
our net is set perfectly,

08:17.400 --> 08:19.933
we'll have more advantages,
more fish.

08:21.833 --> 08:24.033
Stop already, one. Stop.

08:24.067 --> 08:26.867
Turn it off.
Just turn it completely off.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.967
-Shall I pull up my motor?
-Yes.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.100
Watch out for that lever.

08:30.133 --> 08:31.633
That's why we need
you to drive.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.533
You're strong enough
to pull it up.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.300
-Here.
-Nope, give me that.

08:40.533 --> 08:42.933
All right. Make sure
it's not tangled
to the bottom...

08:42.967 --> 08:44.600
Oh! I feel something.

08:46.233 --> 08:47.633
-Fish!
-GIRLS: Yes!

08:48.333 --> 08:49.533
Oh, two of 'em.

08:51.467 --> 08:52.800
Three of 'em.

08:53.467 --> 08:54.567
Pike!

08:58.733 --> 09:00.433
Whoa!

09:01.533 --> 09:04.100
Definitely gonna need
a real big fish rack.

09:04.133 --> 09:05.133
(CHUCKLES)

09:06.667 --> 09:10.167
SUE: There's only boundaries
on who I am when I set them.

09:11.167 --> 09:12.533
True to my nature.

09:12.567 --> 09:15.367
I thrive on challenge.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.133
I thrive on the diversity
that life throws at me.

09:23.567 --> 09:25.567
All remote people look forward

09:25.600 --> 09:27.633
to the sun coming back
in the spring.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.267
But the minute
that the show melts

09:30.300 --> 09:32.900
and opens things up for us,
we're consumed with the need

09:32.933 --> 09:34.467
to get ready
for the following winter.

09:36.433 --> 09:38.533
This year is a little bit
different for me because

09:38.567 --> 09:40.367
I'm building a new building
for myself.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.500
No longer in the corner
of the dining hall.

09:42.533 --> 09:44.933
I'm getting my own
living space.

09:44.967 --> 09:48.600
I'm a month and a half away
from being 10-20 below
zero again.

09:48.633 --> 09:50.500
The time bomb is ticking.

09:50.533 --> 09:52.667
So now I need to
take off my final chores

09:52.700 --> 09:54.033
before it gets nasty again.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.633
There's a lot of fear
associated with the building.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.233
I have no visual
reference here,

10:03.267 --> 10:04.967
yet I know from experience

10:05.000 --> 10:07.600
the predators are gonna
come up out of the river bank

10:07.633 --> 10:09.767
and sneak across the tundra
and hit the first thing.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.567
Unfortunately, that's me.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.900
NARRATOR: Sue's primary
defence is her sight.

10:14.933 --> 10:18.167
Her survival depends on being
able to see all predators

10:18.200 --> 10:19.933
before it's too late.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.933
SUE: I really need
to focus on visibility

10:22.967 --> 10:25.300
so I need to put windows
in the building.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.067
If you can't see
what's coming at you,

10:27.100 --> 10:28.767
you're not gonna know 'til it
comes through the wall.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.933
Been there, done that.
Got the t-shirt
and the coffee mug.

10:30.967 --> 10:32.267
I don't want that again.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.533
SUE: That's where
the window's going.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.500
We need the other ladder.

10:35.533 --> 10:38.733
I've been attacked before,
I've had them come through
the wall before,

10:38.767 --> 10:40.700
and it's
an uncomfortable feeling.

10:40.733 --> 10:43.467
I'm very visual, so...

10:45.133 --> 10:46.267
You got eyeballs?

10:50.400 --> 10:54.167
Dark shadow, dark shape
that I'm not used to
seeing on my horizon.

10:55.933 --> 10:57.433
I gotta get up, gain elevation

10:57.467 --> 10:59.400
and look at it
with my eyeballs

10:59.433 --> 11:02.333
to see if it's
a dangerous shadow

11:02.367 --> 11:03.800
or just a new bush.

11:13.533 --> 11:15.700
What I'm hoping for
is caribou.

11:18.667 --> 11:21.633
NARRATOR: Any opportunity
for fresh meat is critical

11:21.667 --> 11:23.367
since Sue's nearest
grocery store

11:23.400 --> 11:25.467
is almost 500 miles away.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.967
I hunt for the meat
that I eat.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.400
My migration of caribou
got busted up...

11:32.433 --> 11:35.333
They may not come back
through in the fall.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.300
So, potentially,

11:37.333 --> 11:39.467
my meat supply
may never make it.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.000
I may have a year
where I don't get squat.

11:42.033 --> 11:44.167
All I can tell is that
I have a new dark shadow.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.167
One's a bush,
right beyond it is another one
that shouldn't be there.

11:48.167 --> 11:49.267
I mean, it's natural.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.133
It has a right to be
wherever the hell it wants,

11:51.167 --> 11:53.533
but that doesn't mean
I want it up in my grill.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.400
It's a few miles off.

11:56.433 --> 11:58.467
I don't think it's a bear,
not that big.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.167
It could be a caribou.

12:00.200 --> 12:03.133
The area I need to go in
is a couple miles away.

12:03.167 --> 12:04.633
So when I go out,

12:04.667 --> 12:06.000
I'm gonna go
prepared with a gun

12:06.033 --> 12:07.933
to shoot something
if I have to defend myself

12:07.967 --> 12:09.500
or there's a caribou for meat.

12:09.533 --> 12:11.467
I got bullets, knives...

12:11.500 --> 12:13.167
I don't know what I'm
gonna run into,

12:13.200 --> 12:14.767
but something's gonna die.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.533
Something needs to get
into my freezer.

12:38.767 --> 12:42.133
You can see right here,
on the other side
of this brush...

12:42.167 --> 12:43.467
Caught my eye.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.267
Some caribou prints.

12:45.967 --> 12:47.467
They're pretty fresh.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.233
It's not five minutes ago,
but definitely since
this morning.

12:52.033 --> 12:54.133
Could have been
the shape I saw earlier.

12:54.167 --> 12:59.233
I'm still headed to see
exactly what I can find.

12:59.267 --> 13:02.400
You just never know
but you got to be prepared
for anything.

13:04.533 --> 13:07.333
GLENN: A lot of times
you don't have exactly
what you want out here.

13:07.367 --> 13:10.933
But you get by with what you
can get from nature.

13:17.433 --> 13:21.167
It's always a matter of
economy out here.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.567
You're trying to get food
with the least expenditure
of energy.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.500
I found a spot where there
could be some grayling

13:32.533 --> 13:34.133
so I'm just gonna
cast into here

13:34.167 --> 13:35.433
and see if I catch a fish,

13:35.467 --> 13:37.300
I don't see any fish yet.

13:41.133 --> 13:44.833
The mosquitoes just get to be
too crazy out here.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.200
I have to look at the world
through a net,

13:48.733 --> 13:50.567
try not to use it
more than I have to.

13:55.367 --> 13:56.733
Ooh, something hit it!

14:02.367 --> 14:04.367
Got off though... Try again.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.767
A lot of people think
'cause you're out
in the wilderness,

14:08.800 --> 14:10.800
there's no problem
finding animals.

14:11.933 --> 14:14.067
But way but way up here
in these mountains,

14:14.100 --> 14:15.600
it's really hungry country

14:15.633 --> 14:17.800
The life up here's just spread
really thin over the land

14:17.833 --> 14:20.733
so you have to look a long
ways to find something to eat.

14:21.567 --> 14:23.400
Didn't find any grayling
in there.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.467
Some years there are quite
a few grayling out here,

14:29.500 --> 14:31.767
but you just can't
count on it.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.200
Summer's just a hard time
to find food out here.

14:36.267 --> 14:38.367
This looks like
a promising spot.

14:42.133 --> 14:43.433
Try again.

14:43.467 --> 14:46.667
I definitely need to try
and get some food tonight.

14:46.700 --> 14:49.433
Right down in there,
there's a fish.

14:55.067 --> 14:57.267
It's hard to see
with this head net on
so I'm going to take it off,

14:57.300 --> 14:59.433
even though the mosquitoes
are all around me.

15:06.733 --> 15:09.433
I'm getting eaten up
by the mosquitoes out here.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.733
Try again.

15:13.933 --> 15:15.367
Lost sight of him.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.667
Try again.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.167
If I went down stream
far enough

15:18.200 --> 15:19.567
there'd be a much
better chance

15:19.600 --> 15:21.300
that I could find
some grayling,

15:21.333 --> 15:22.933
but it's a long walk.

15:22.967 --> 15:25.967
And it might be more
economical for me to look for
some fish in the lake.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.033
CHIP: We're miles beyond
the end of the road.

15:30.067 --> 15:31.733
And if you don't
kill something

15:31.767 --> 15:33.033
or you don't catch something,

15:33.067 --> 15:34.367
you'll have nothing.

15:45.067 --> 15:46.767
Agnes is back at camp
right now

15:46.800 --> 15:47.967
and she's cutting up
white fish,

15:48.000 --> 15:49.900
and I went out to go
scout out some wood.

15:51.833 --> 15:54.067
We make sure that
we can cut it up
and throw it in the river,

15:54.100 --> 15:55.800
and get it down to
where we want to go.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.067
This is really good wood
area here.

16:01.100 --> 16:03.367
This is the last of our
break up ice,
it's all busted up.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.967
And this was put here
during the flood
and left behind.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.900
There's a lot of logs here.
It's in kind of a small area.

16:09.933 --> 16:12.500
We'll be able to chuck out
all the wood we can
into the river,

16:12.533 --> 16:14.900
tie them together
and take them down as a raft.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.267
Well, wood's important,
you know,

16:16.300 --> 16:18.033
when you live
a subsistence life,

16:18.067 --> 16:20.500
and you're using the materials
and stuff from the land.

16:20.533 --> 16:22.267
We use trees for poles,

16:22.300 --> 16:25.333
we use them for fish racks,
we use them for harpoons,

16:25.367 --> 16:27.967
we build sleds,
we can build a boat.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.767
Wood right here can
heat your house.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.267
If you ain't got heat,
you ain't got life.

16:34.567 --> 16:36.367
And since I came up here
to look for wood,

16:36.400 --> 16:38.000
I'm also not supposed
to go back until

16:38.033 --> 16:40.300
I've got my wife
some fish rack poles.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.200
It's a necessary part
of drying fish.

16:42.233 --> 16:46.833
I just want to have enough
racks to make sure my

16:46.867 --> 16:51.267
summer haul is gonna be
nice and dry.

16:51.300 --> 16:54.300
If not, that'll just make
a total waste.

16:57.367 --> 16:59.033
Oh, I'm looking for long,
thin poles

16:59.067 --> 17:01.367
that are light,
hopefully dried up.

17:01.400 --> 17:04.033
If you have big round poles
then you end up with

17:04.067 --> 17:06.800
a lot of the meat touching
the pole and it doesn't dry.

17:06.833 --> 17:09.100
So you want them
as thin as possible.

17:09.133 --> 17:10.267
Kinda stuff I'm looking
for, though...

17:10.300 --> 17:11.800
This is a little long
and a little large.

17:20.600 --> 17:22.467
I don't know,
this one's busted
in the middle.

17:23.467 --> 17:24.933
Fucking pole!

17:25.667 --> 17:27.067
So head back to the boat.

17:27.100 --> 17:28.667
I don't see any more poles.

17:36.633 --> 17:38.767
Wife said don't come back
without poles.

17:40.933 --> 17:43.567
That's too big
of a fucking pole.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.200
Ah, I'm just gonna run up
and grab that pole,

17:46.233 --> 17:47.800
since I got the hip waders on.

17:55.167 --> 17:57.033
You fucker, you're too short.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.333
She said five poles.

18:05.367 --> 18:08.067
If I don't come back poles
she ain't gonna be happy.

18:12.733 --> 18:14.800
I just want a pole.

18:14.833 --> 18:16.467
The ice busts them up, though.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.767
Most of all the ones
I've come across

18:18.800 --> 18:20.967
are folded up,
cracked in the middle.

18:23.567 --> 18:25.100
Great firewood.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.500
Lousy poles.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.233
It's way too big. (CHUCKLES)

18:41.200 --> 18:42.667
Fucking pole.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.067
Wait, there might be one
back here.

18:47.833 --> 18:49.000
(SNIFFS)

19:00.533 --> 19:03.233
This will be a drying pole
for today.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.967
Nice, light and dry.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.567
I can't give the woman
a perfect deal yet,
but we'll get it there.

19:14.667 --> 19:17.300
Ah, pole... Genuine pole!

19:17.333 --> 19:19.367
Plenty long and crooked.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.000
I see one more pole.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.933
We got the five poles
so I can safely return
to camp.

19:58.600 --> 19:59.900
Idi when you scale them,

19:59.933 --> 20:02.433
you try to make sure
you take as much scale off...

20:02.467 --> 20:04.633
Especially from
the stomach part, too.

20:04.667 --> 20:06.500
'Cause that's where
most of the fat is.

20:07.867 --> 20:10.800
Idi's learning
the way to cut fish.

20:10.833 --> 20:13.900
It's good that they know
how to cut fish...

20:13.933 --> 20:15.733
In case, I can't cut the fish,

20:15.767 --> 20:18.433
all our food won't be ruined
or wasted.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.900
Ah, the fish cutters.

20:27.933 --> 20:29.533
How's the fish cutting going?

20:29.567 --> 20:32.133
-We've done all the pike...
-Yeah.

20:32.167 --> 20:33.800
We're done with
the white fish.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.633
You got a tub of white fish
for sure.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.733
Well, I didn't exactly have
the best choice of poles

20:37.767 --> 20:39.333
but I brought you back
five do-ables.

20:39.367 --> 20:40.400
All right.

20:43.300 --> 20:44.300
(SIGHS)

20:55.933 --> 20:57.333
CHIP: This is totally ad hoc.

20:58.100 --> 20:59.733
This is just making do, okay?

20:59.767 --> 21:01.233
This isn't like
the permanent rack.

21:01.267 --> 21:02.900
AGNES: Whatever it takes.

21:02.933 --> 21:05.667
I'm happy, this will last us
for, like, a week.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.367
Two, three more days of this,

21:07.400 --> 21:09.500
then I should be done
with my white fishing.

21:14.867 --> 21:16.500
ANDY: The best part of
living out in the bush...

21:16.533 --> 21:20.400
You have to adapt to whatever
mother nature throws.

21:20.433 --> 21:22.400
And you try and stay
a step ahead of her,

21:22.433 --> 21:24.400
but most of the time
you're playing catch up.

21:30.567 --> 21:33.733
Well, this boat
that I lost last night

21:33.767 --> 21:35.933
is critical to everything
I'm doing this summer.

21:38.100 --> 21:40.533
NARRATOR: Andy's on the search
for a $10,000 boat

21:40.567 --> 21:42.933
that's gone adrift
with his fresh water supply

21:42.967 --> 21:45.200
somewhere in the vast Yukon.

21:45.233 --> 21:48.467
He's got to find it
before his fuel runs out.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.300
I got a million projects
I'm trying to get done
right now,

21:51.333 --> 21:53.533
and I got my
schedules lined out

21:53.567 --> 21:57.100
on what I want to do
on what days and...

21:57.133 --> 22:00.600
And something like this
unexpected comes up
that I hadn't planned on.

22:00.633 --> 22:04.533
It brings a lot of stress
and a lot of frustration
for me.

22:04.567 --> 22:07.733
Hey, that's the life
along the river, shit happens.

22:07.767 --> 22:09.133
You gotta deal with it.

22:15.967 --> 22:17.533
I'm switching gas tanks.

22:17.567 --> 22:19.900
Each tank of gas is 5 gallons

22:19.933 --> 22:22.933
at about $5.50
to $6.00 a gallon.

22:22.967 --> 22:27.067
By the time they get down
to me they're about
$7.00 a gallon.

22:27.100 --> 22:29.300
Depending on how far down
river this boat goes,

22:29.333 --> 22:31.867
this is gonna be
a fairly expensive trip

22:31.900 --> 22:34.800
for someone who doesn't have
a lot of money

22:34.833 --> 22:36.500
to spend on
this kind of stuff.

22:37.267 --> 22:38.567
(BEEPS)

22:41.433 --> 22:44.400
I'm a little irritated that
I gotta spend this time today

22:44.433 --> 22:46.167
basically killing this day...

22:47.467 --> 22:50.100
And a whole bunch of fuel
to go get a boat.

22:51.567 --> 22:53.333
I'm feeling a little
bummed out at myself

22:53.367 --> 22:56.500
for not checking it before
I went to bed last night.

22:56.533 --> 22:58.867
Without it,
I don't know what I'll do.

23:00.467 --> 23:02.667
Hey, it looks like I might
see it up ahead here,

23:02.700 --> 23:04.033
two miles off...

23:05.900 --> 23:07.533
Beached against the bank.

23:09.500 --> 23:12.267
Beat kinda looks like it
from here.

23:12.300 --> 23:17.300
It looks like the current
pushed it into this slough.

23:17.333 --> 23:20.733
NARRATOR: Navigating
the shallows of the Yukon
is a difficult challenge.

23:20.767 --> 23:24.400
One miscalculation and Andy
could lose both boats.

23:24.433 --> 23:27.700
It's pretty shallow in there
where it's grounded.

23:27.733 --> 23:29.467
My biggest problem now
is gonna be

23:29.500 --> 23:33.067
if I can get my big boat here
into where that boat is.

23:33.100 --> 23:36.533
You know, I don't want to
hit bottom with my prop
too much 'cause A,

23:36.567 --> 23:39.133
I don't have the second prop
with me right now,

23:39.700 --> 23:42.467
and B, it's expensive.

23:42.500 --> 23:45.567
Not sure if I'm gonna be
able to get into it
with this boat or not.

23:47.400 --> 23:51.467
Look at that, I just...
My weight coming in just
moved the boat again.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.300
Shit, it's going down
into the shallows.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.333
Every day you're out here,
you gotta adapt to
something new.

24:13.367 --> 24:14.400
Good.

24:14.433 --> 24:16.033
It's an endless progression of

24:16.067 --> 24:18.400
problem solving, comprising,

24:18.433 --> 24:21.833
MacGyvering things together
all the time.

24:21.867 --> 24:24.667
That's life in
the Alaska bush, adapt.

24:26.367 --> 24:28.367
The first thing I'm gonna
have to do is

24:28.400 --> 24:31.567
pump this tank dry
to lighten that boat up

24:31.600 --> 24:33.467
and make it a shallower draft

24:33.500 --> 24:35.567
so I can line it back up
the slough here.

24:40.667 --> 24:43.533
NARRATOR: The boat is carrying
300 gallons of fresh water,

24:43.567 --> 24:45.400
an essential resource...

24:46.867 --> 24:49.233
But in order to pull the boat
from the shallows,

24:49.267 --> 24:51.500
Andy will have to dump it all.

24:51.533 --> 24:52.700
This kinda sucks.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.500
The challenge here is how do
I get both of these boats

24:59.533 --> 25:03.100
back out of this shallow area
over to the Yukon.

25:03.133 --> 25:05.800
I've got about a 100 yards
of really shallow water

25:05.833 --> 25:08.800
between me and
where the Yukon's flowing.

25:08.833 --> 25:12.800
It's a hard rock bottom
that will really mess up
my prop if I touch bottom.

25:12.833 --> 25:16.200
And if you don't get your prop
in very far you don't have
much pulling power.

25:16.233 --> 25:20.100
So it's gonna be bit of
a challenge to figure out
how to get this out.

25:20.133 --> 25:24.467
I might have to just tie
a rope to my big boat...

25:24.500 --> 25:27.767
Once I get going out away
from the shallow area here...

25:27.800 --> 25:30.533
I should be able to get enough
line to hook onto this one

25:30.567 --> 25:32.300
and tow it out. (EXHALES)

25:37.933 --> 25:40.867
GLENN: In the summer,
I have to concentrate more
on smaller animals

25:40.900 --> 25:42.700
that I can eat up
in a shorter time.

25:42.733 --> 25:44.833
So preservation's
not such a big issue.

25:56.100 --> 25:58.033
I don't have much food left.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.933
So I've been getting
all set up to go out

26:01.967 --> 26:03.333
and try to catch pike

26:03.367 --> 26:04.700
over on the other side
of the lake.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.433
I'm gonna go
a little over a mile

26:11.467 --> 26:13.767
to where I'm gonna fish today.

26:14.533 --> 26:15.800
Pike travel in different areas

26:15.833 --> 26:18.333
at different times
of the year, and right now,

26:18.367 --> 26:20.233
I'm hoping that they're
gonna be in an area

26:20.267 --> 26:22.900
where they've
spawned in past

26:23.900 --> 26:25.633
and see if I spot any fish.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.400
I don't know for sure.

26:27.433 --> 26:28.867
I'm way up here
in the mountains...

26:28.900 --> 26:30.967
There are not large numbers
of fish up here

26:31.000 --> 26:35.200
the way there are when you're
living closer to the coast
or on bigger rivers.

26:35.233 --> 26:37.667
This lake is really isolated.

26:37.700 --> 26:40.300
There's certain kinds of
places where you can find
things to eat.

26:40.333 --> 26:43.300
You gotta really keep track
of what's going on in nature.

26:43.333 --> 26:45.200
If you just going around
randomly looking for something
to eat

26:45.233 --> 26:47.000
you're going to
starve to death.

26:49.300 --> 26:52.100
This looks like a good
pikey place to me.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.267
Oh! A little too far.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.400
Got it right in the weeds.

27:12.433 --> 27:14.733
Need my weed-less hook today.

27:14.767 --> 27:17.033
Pike likes the weeds,
and unfortunately,

27:17.067 --> 27:19.433
my favourite lure
for this kind of fishing...

27:20.367 --> 27:21.667
Is broken.

27:21.700 --> 27:25.133
So, I collect more weeds
than I want to, but...

27:35.867 --> 27:36.867
Oh, wow.

27:40.900 --> 27:42.467
I got a bite!

27:44.433 --> 27:46.133
Here comes a fish.

27:53.900 --> 27:56.033
There, now he's hooked.

28:03.467 --> 28:05.067
(THUDS)

28:08.267 --> 28:09.567
That was crazy!

28:09.600 --> 28:12.067
I never had a pike
get off the hook

28:12.100 --> 28:13.533
and then grab him
with my bare hand

28:13.567 --> 28:14.733
and throw him back in a boat.

28:16.933 --> 28:18.333
It's heart's still beating.

28:18.367 --> 28:21.367
That's why before
I do anything,
I'm gonna secure this fish.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.700
There'd be nothing worse than
having him get away now.

28:23.733 --> 28:27.033
I got a little tool here
made out of a piece of bone.

28:27.067 --> 28:30.300
It helps you to stick this
string through their mouth
without getting bit.

28:30.333 --> 28:33.233
They have some
really sharp teeth
for grabbing on to stuff.

28:33.267 --> 28:34.433
I have him tied here,

28:34.467 --> 28:37.000
and you keep it in the water,
so you keep him cool.

28:37.033 --> 28:40.067
That's a couple of meals
for me right there.

28:40.100 --> 28:42.267
And I'm gonna get
more than just the meat
out of him, too.

28:42.300 --> 28:43.767
I'm gonna eat other parts.

28:46.767 --> 28:48.633
Usually, once you have
a big scene like that,

28:48.667 --> 28:50.233
it kind of messes up
the fishing.

28:50.267 --> 28:52.767
And that's probably all
the action you'll get out
of that spot.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.667
But, we did well today.

28:56.033 --> 28:58.733
I'm gonna head back
to my camp now.

28:58.767 --> 29:01.300
We've got
plenty of fish for dinner,
that's for sure.

29:06.067 --> 29:07.633
CHIP: We take it as it comes.

29:07.667 --> 29:09.133
We're opportunists.

29:09.167 --> 29:11.067
And we'll see
what opportunity brings to us.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.967
Plan today is to get
more of this fuel.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.333
This right here is heat
and it's light,

29:29.367 --> 29:31.267
and it's cooking power.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.967
This is another part of
essence of subsistence.

29:35.300 --> 29:39.300
If you can harvest wood,
you can get by.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.100
CHIP: The motor's warmed up,
you ready to go?

29:41.133 --> 29:42.667
-ALL: Yeah!
-All right, let's go.

29:46.800 --> 29:48.400
CHIP: I need to have
my kids learn.

29:48.433 --> 29:50.700
I need my kids to know
how to do this themselves.

29:50.733 --> 29:54.033
And we do this as a family
so we have a lot of fun
doing things together.

29:54.067 --> 29:56.767
And we tell them all the time
that it's the small details
that count,

29:56.800 --> 29:58.500
that add up to
the really nice stuff.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.167
How about we go
start out in this little
slough over here?

30:04.200 --> 30:05.533
It's packed with wood.

30:16.233 --> 30:17.600
Look out, babe.

30:20.867 --> 30:22.900
You can go get some rope,
go put a loop-a-rope.

30:22.933 --> 30:26.200
Tie it nice and tight and then
have it ready for the next one
that we put on.

30:42.533 --> 30:45.633
When you go around it twice
it gets under pressure,
get a little tight.

30:46.267 --> 30:47.800
It will grip it better.

30:50.667 --> 30:52.600
Then all we have to do after
we get this front one done

30:52.633 --> 30:55.600
is just keep tying logs
into a long trail.

31:02.667 --> 31:05.133
Oh, we're doing
real good, girls.

31:05.167 --> 31:07.167
You're working as hard
as we are,

31:07.200 --> 31:08.567
that's what matters.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.700
We all work together,
we get done quicker.

31:11.733 --> 31:13.833
I don't want my kids
dependent on anything

31:13.867 --> 31:15.533
other than themselves.

31:15.567 --> 31:18.333
If they can become
heat independent and they
know how to get wood

31:18.367 --> 31:21.000
at different times
of the year and the different
ways of getting it,

31:21.033 --> 31:23.233
they're all the better off.

31:23.267 --> 31:25.200
-What do you think, Agnes,
looking good?
-Yep.

31:25.233 --> 31:26.900
Couple of months' worth
of firewood, easily.

31:26.933 --> 31:27.933
Yep.

31:29.433 --> 31:31.000
This is gonna be
a good enough raft here,

31:31.033 --> 31:32.533
so shall we head, home?

31:37.633 --> 31:39.500
What I've got here is a whole
bunch of firewood

31:39.533 --> 31:41.300
that's going to get us
through the summer.

31:41.333 --> 31:44.333
We have enough dry wood
at the house to get us through
till this all dries out,

31:44.367 --> 31:46.067
so it's all good.

31:46.100 --> 31:48.100
And my daughters have
learnt something,

31:48.133 --> 31:49.800
learnt where to
pick the woods,

31:49.833 --> 31:51.567
the places where the wood
gets trapped.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.800
They've learnt the area
around this area

31:53.833 --> 31:56.133
so that they can get stuff
themselves someday.

31:59.833 --> 32:02.267
Firewood for the summer
cost us 20 bucks in gas

32:02.300 --> 32:04.467
and seven hours of our time,

32:05.800 --> 32:08.833
This is probably 2,000 bucks
worth of heat...

32:09.167 --> 32:10.567
Easily.

32:10.600 --> 32:13.367
And that is excellent.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.367
We've got money in the bank
with this stuff.

32:17.900 --> 32:21.233
SUE: Being out here,
I may die at any moment.

32:21.267 --> 32:23.900
There's a million
natural disasters

32:23.933 --> 32:26.867
waiting to swallow you up
and spit out your balls.

32:33.700 --> 32:35.333
We're getting
close to the area where

32:35.367 --> 32:37.433
I saw the caribou shadows.

32:37.467 --> 32:40.333
But I'm not seeing
anything right now.

32:40.367 --> 32:43.333
It's very disconcerting.
The caribou are not here.

32:43.367 --> 32:45.600
And my fuel is being wasted.

32:48.833 --> 32:52.033
NARRATOR: Gas cost Sue
nearly $20 a gallon.

32:52.067 --> 32:54.733
It's a resource
she can't afford to waste.

33:01.867 --> 33:03.333
There's a little coal seam

33:03.367 --> 33:05.233
that as long as it's
still exposed,

33:05.267 --> 33:07.867
I can maybe go
and get a little coal.

33:07.900 --> 33:09.133
It's alternative energy.

33:09.167 --> 33:12.333
It's another natural resource
I can use for my own survival.

33:14.333 --> 33:15.633
I'm betting my bottom dollar,

33:15.667 --> 33:18.033
it is worth it for me
to get over there.

33:18.067 --> 33:21.567
The only way I can do that...
Cross some ice cold water.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.200
I want to see
if there's some coal.

33:38.833 --> 33:40.200
Oh, yeah!

33:41.900 --> 33:43.767
Black gold baby!

33:43.800 --> 33:44.800
(CHUCKLES)

33:54.167 --> 33:56.867
I'm really happy I found it,
I'm happy to be here.

33:56.900 --> 33:59.767
But you can look
right up there...

33:59.800 --> 34:01.900
That's a big
ice ledge you got.

34:01.933 --> 34:03.967
Fuck, oh, I don't know,
a hundred pounds or more

34:04.000 --> 34:05.333
of ice hanging over my head

34:05.367 --> 34:08.867
that's wanting to let gravity
send it into the river.

34:12.133 --> 34:14.267
The sun's out,
it's melting fast.

34:14.300 --> 34:18.800
And, is it possible that it
comes down and kills me?

34:18.833 --> 34:20.267
Yeah, absolutely.

34:20.300 --> 34:23.033
But when I chose
to be out here,

34:23.067 --> 34:24.867
I chose to accept

34:24.900 --> 34:28.533
that I'm gonna meet some
really strange, frickin' end,

34:28.567 --> 34:31.833
but right up until the point
that it does smack me,

34:31.867 --> 34:34.133
I'm going to be here trying
to eek out a living.

34:34.167 --> 34:35.500
There's any number of things

34:35.533 --> 34:38.333
that might cause
my demise out here.

34:38.367 --> 34:41.800
I break myself,
I make a poor decision.

34:41.833 --> 34:44.200
It will happen,
it won't be scripted,

34:44.233 --> 34:46.367
I won't see it coming,
and it'll suck.

34:47.367 --> 34:50.200
So I'm kind of
out of time here...

34:50.233 --> 34:53.433
I mean, it's a beautiful
rich area,

34:53.467 --> 34:56.233
but for right now,
I want to get
the hell out of this section.

34:57.033 --> 34:59.633
Because it will go...

34:59.667 --> 35:01.833
And I'd rather it didn't
take me with it.

35:05.567 --> 35:07.300
It was a good day.

35:07.333 --> 35:10.467
I didn't get to shoot
at a caribou...

35:10.500 --> 35:12.500
But, when one door closes,
another opens.

35:12.533 --> 35:13.767
I got coal!

35:13.800 --> 35:16.367
And it's time for me to start
heading back to the barn.

35:20.767 --> 35:22.167
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's that?

35:22.200 --> 35:23.533
A squirrel.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.467
(GUNSHOT)

35:28.500 --> 35:30.467
Got him!

35:30.500 --> 35:34.233
Hadn't gone out intentionally
seeking a squirrel,

35:34.267 --> 35:35.800
but, opportunity knocks,

35:35.833 --> 35:38.200
you gotta be ready
to answer the door.

35:40.367 --> 35:41.567
There he is.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.367
One fat little mamma-jamma.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.267
He goes in the freezer.

35:45.300 --> 35:46.667
The caribou haven't come in.

35:46.700 --> 35:48.233
I haven't got any big game,

35:48.267 --> 35:51.667
so I'm concerned about
filling up my freezer.

35:51.700 --> 35:54.433
Winter for me is 280 days...
Totally alone.

35:54.467 --> 35:56.233
There is no grocery store
that I can say,

35:56.267 --> 35:57.533
"Oh, I'm running low on milk."

35:57.567 --> 36:01.300
What I need to do now is
concentrate on small game.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.533
Right now,
squirrel is on the menu.

36:03.567 --> 36:06.900
The fur is not real good
this time of year
for making things,

36:06.933 --> 36:09.800
but, I'll skin him out
and put him in the freezie

36:09.833 --> 36:11.467
for some of my
winter meat supply.

36:13.133 --> 36:15.967
So meat in the freezer,
coal in the stove.

36:16.633 --> 36:17.900
Good day!

36:18.267 --> 36:19.567
Booyah!

36:26.533 --> 36:28.067
C'mon. (SQUEAKING)

36:28.100 --> 36:29.233
You want your little snacks?

36:29.267 --> 36:30.500
Come on.

36:31.133 --> 36:33.467
You know what you get.

36:33.500 --> 36:35.833
You didn't help me
flush this one, little buddy.

36:36.767 --> 36:38.333
But you can have
the leftovers.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.600
I have little foxes that are
completely wild

36:42.633 --> 36:44.867
but like to come up
and be my buddies.

36:44.900 --> 36:46.600
They are my social world,

36:46.633 --> 36:48.767
but I never lose sight that
they're still a predator...

36:48.800 --> 36:50.067
And I respect that.

36:52.300 --> 36:55.867
I am conscientious
about the animals, um...

36:56.767 --> 36:58.700
This little thing, you know,

36:58.733 --> 37:02.200
it's just trying to eek out
a living on the tundra
like I am...

37:02.233 --> 37:03.567
And it gave up its life.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.667
I don't take that
very lightly.

37:05.700 --> 37:08.667
(EXCLAIMING) Wait your turn.

37:08.700 --> 37:11.533
You can have the whole middle
and the guts, how's that?

37:11.567 --> 37:13.933
Squirrel is one of their
main stays, same with a bear,

37:13.967 --> 37:15.733
they love these things.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.200
And they are tasty
little suckers.

37:20.100 --> 37:21.500
You want this?

37:24.967 --> 37:26.333
You want that?

37:28.233 --> 37:29.533
There you go!

37:32.200 --> 37:35.000
I am taking out
his intestines...

37:35.533 --> 37:37.900
And he's done.

37:37.933 --> 37:39.500
You get one or two
of these guys

37:39.533 --> 37:41.933
and you put them in a pot with
some taters and some carrots,

37:41.967 --> 37:44.533
and you got a nice
little squirrel stew.

37:44.567 --> 37:47.767
Well, I got a good
bag of coal.

37:47.800 --> 37:51.100
I got a nice little squirrel
for my small game stash.

37:51.133 --> 37:53.000
(GIGGLES) This is an awesome
frickin' day!

37:55.333 --> 37:57.267
ANDY: Every day, you have to
adapt your plans,

37:57.300 --> 37:59.333
and you have to have
a plan A and a plan B.

37:59.367 --> 38:01.367
'Cause often times,
plan A doesn't work.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.767
I think we're doing
pretty good.

38:27.367 --> 38:29.167
Everything's looking
really good.

38:31.133 --> 38:33.200
I got my boat back.

38:33.233 --> 38:37.200
This boat's
absolutely critical to me
in the summertime.

38:37.233 --> 38:40.800
Pretty important piece
of equipment not to be losing.

38:40.833 --> 38:43.800
I almost always tie my boats
up with two lines.

38:45.267 --> 38:48.000
Just didn't do it last night
and I'm paying the price.

38:49.767 --> 38:51.733
I'm a long ways
from home right now.

38:53.967 --> 38:55.367
Really need to get back home

38:55.400 --> 38:58.100
so I can get back
on to my projects,
get back to work.

39:00.167 --> 39:04.700
It's been frustrating, but,
all in a day, I guess.

39:11.600 --> 39:12.733
Victory!

39:12.767 --> 39:15.333
ANDY: Well, I only had to go
40 miles.

39:15.367 --> 39:16.800
I don't know if it was
the wind or something

39:16.833 --> 39:18.500
that pushed it down into
one of the sloughs there.

39:18.533 --> 39:20.767
Well, I think we should
buy a lottery ticket.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.667
(CHUCKLES)

39:22.700 --> 39:24.867
It's one of the things
that happens out here.

39:24.900 --> 39:28.267
You live along the river
and stuff's gonna happen.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.967
I've got a number of boats
down here

39:31.000 --> 39:34.100
and sooner or later
something's going to happen
to one or two of them.

39:34.133 --> 39:36.900
Well, that was a bit of drama
we didn't need today.

39:36.933 --> 39:39.933
I just was too tired
last night to put
a second rope on it.

39:39.967 --> 39:41.167
Just didn't think about it.

39:41.200 --> 39:42.633
Well, you will next time.

39:42.667 --> 39:45.700
Oh, I will from now on,
I guarantee it! Every boat.

39:45.733 --> 39:48.867
Well, darling, just think on
the sunny side, you know,
you got your boat back.

39:48.900 --> 39:51.000
It could've been
a really bad day.

39:51.033 --> 39:53.267
It was just one of those
screw ups that happens.

39:53.300 --> 39:56.833
I lost some money in fuel
and a day of my time.

39:56.867 --> 39:58.967
But, um, worse things
could've happened,

39:59.000 --> 40:02.833
so, all in all,
I'm feeling pretty good now.

40:02.867 --> 40:05.800
Um, and I can assure you
I have two lines on it
right now.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.833
GLENN: Most people don't
butcher animals.

40:12.867 --> 40:15.067
And that's kinda
weird to me now.

40:15.100 --> 40:17.833
The idea that you
wouldn't know
what intestines look like.

40:29.233 --> 40:33.267
I was running low on food,
so I'm actually,

40:33.300 --> 40:36.400
really excited
to eat this fish.

40:36.433 --> 40:38.100
Now I've got food for
a couple of days.

40:46.533 --> 40:49.600
This pike is a lean fish.

40:49.633 --> 40:52.800
If you're eating
just meat and fat,

40:52.833 --> 40:57.267
about 70% of your calories
have to come from fat

40:57.300 --> 40:59.067
or you won't feel well.

40:59.100 --> 41:01.800
But, we'll get
what fat is in it,

41:01.833 --> 41:04.933
by utilising the parts
of the fish that a lot people
might throw away.

41:05.700 --> 41:07.600
There's some fat, see?

41:07.633 --> 41:09.200
On the stomach.

41:10.467 --> 41:12.300
The heart. It's still beating.

41:14.133 --> 41:15.667
That's common.

41:15.700 --> 41:18.733
Pike hearts beat for hours
after you take them out
of the pike.

41:21.267 --> 41:22.500
This fish has already spawned

41:22.533 --> 41:24.500
so it doesn't have
a lot of eggs.

41:24.533 --> 41:26.667
Take out the few eggs
that are in there.

41:28.267 --> 41:30.567
This is the oesophagus
right here.

41:30.600 --> 41:31.833
I'm gonna eat
the spleen today.

41:36.167 --> 41:37.467
Nice pike liver.

41:41.033 --> 41:43.433
People who have
a job earn money...

41:43.467 --> 41:45.900
To buy food,
to buy their house.

41:45.933 --> 41:49.233
My house cost next to nothing.

41:49.267 --> 41:53.667
Uh, my food,
I get here just without
paying cash for it.

41:57.267 --> 41:58.967
I live a subsistence
lifestyle,

41:59.000 --> 42:03.500
that's how I get the things
I need to live from
the local resources.

42:03.533 --> 42:07.967
A lot of my energy goes
into getting food out here.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.600
I'm not out working for
a paycheque every day

42:10.633 --> 42:14.633
and I like this a lot better
than sitting in an office.

42:18.267 --> 42:19.500
Pike liver.

42:19.533 --> 42:21.700
That's really tasty and it's
a lot different from

42:21.733 --> 42:23.900
caribou liver or
porcupine liver.

42:25.900 --> 42:28.200
It's even different from
a white fish liver.

42:29.867 --> 42:31.533
Every animal's got
its own flavours.
