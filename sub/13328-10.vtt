00:16.291 --> 00:18.291
( theme music playing )

00:26.834 --> 00:28.542
( whistles )

00:50.792 --> 00:52.542
Okay,
so cool ideas.

00:52.542 --> 00:54.083
We've got
leather jacket.

00:54.083 --> 00:55.583
- That's good
for the image.
- Mm-hmm.

00:55.583 --> 00:57.458
- Where's yours?
- It's on my chair.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.166
All right, uh...

00:59.166 --> 01:01.834
you could put a cigarette
behind your ear, or a pencil.

01:01.834 --> 01:03.291
No.
What else do you got?

01:03.291 --> 01:06.375
Um... you could have
a bit of hay coming out

01:06.375 --> 01:08.166
of your mouth--
a little bit of hay.

01:08.166 --> 01:10.125
- All the time?
- Yeah.

01:10.125 --> 01:11.542
To look cool,
just sort of...

01:11.542 --> 01:14.417
( mumbling )
Hey, how's it going?
Hey, man.

01:15.458 --> 01:17.208
All right, question mark
on that one.

01:17.208 --> 01:20.375
So, good news anyway.
We've got a winner
for the fan competition.

01:20.375 --> 01:22.417
- Mel?
- Yeah, how'd you know that?

01:22.417 --> 01:24.000
'Cause there was probably
only one entry.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.917
- No, there was
hundreds, actually.
- Really?

01:25.917 --> 01:27.709
Yep.
They're all from Mel.

01:27.709 --> 01:29.166
- And one from Jemaine.
- Right.

01:29.166 --> 01:31.166
- But he was disqualified.
- Jemaine: Disqualified?

01:31.166 --> 01:32.875
- Murray: Yep.
- Why was I disqualified?

01:32.875 --> 01:34.834
Because you can't
be a fan of the band.

01:34.834 --> 01:36.542
- Why?
- It's not a good look.

01:36.542 --> 01:38.709
- But I'm a fan.
- Yeah, but people
look at the fan list

01:38.709 --> 01:41.417
and they say, "Oh,
hang on, that guy's
in the band, isn't he?

01:41.417 --> 01:42.875
Well, he likes himself."

01:42.875 --> 01:45.000
It's not a good look.
You don't see Bret
on the fan list.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.375
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
I'm not a fan of the band.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.667
I'm more a fan
of popular bands

01:49.667 --> 01:51.291
like the Bee Gees,
Pearl Jam.

01:51.291 --> 01:53.917
All right. That's what we're
trying to do is become popular.

01:53.917 --> 01:55.583
That's why I've got
this competition, you know?

01:55.583 --> 01:58.291
- All right, what did Mel win?
- First prize--

01:58.291 --> 02:00.333
the chance to cook
for you two tomorrow night.

02:00.333 --> 02:03.583
That's a terrible prize.
I'm glad I didn't win that.

02:03.583 --> 02:06.709
It's a good prize.
And you're excited about it.

02:06.709 --> 02:09.041
I've already e-mailed her
pretending to be you

02:09.041 --> 02:10.667
saying you're excited.

02:10.667 --> 02:12.250
Were you pretending
to be me as well?

02:12.250 --> 02:14.667
Yes, that's what I do.
It's-- it's easier.

02:14.667 --> 02:17.041
All right? Actually,
next time you see Mel,

02:17.041 --> 02:19.417
you might want to apologize
for your last e-mail.

02:19.417 --> 02:21.083
Okay. Why?

02:21.083 --> 02:23.750
It's just, I think
she was quite insulted.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.458
- All right?
- What did you say?

02:25.458 --> 02:27.500
We'd better go, okay?

02:27.500 --> 02:28.917
We've got a gig, guys.
Come on.

02:28.917 --> 02:31.083
( crowd chattering )

02:31.083 --> 02:33.166
Hey, watch your step there.

02:33.166 --> 02:35.083
Stick together.
It's really busy here tonight.

02:35.083 --> 02:36.417
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Mel.

02:36.417 --> 02:38.500
Oh my god, I'm so
excited about dinner.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.083
Whoo! Yes!
Hey, Bret, that e-mail...

02:41.083 --> 02:43.166
Bonjour,
lay ho, salaam, nabadeey,

02:43.166 --> 02:46.250
konnichiwa,  and  hola.

02:46.250 --> 02:49.959
Welcome to
Tuesday World Music Jam.

02:49.959 --> 02:51.625
My baby, come on,
let's hear it!

02:51.625 --> 02:54.917
World Music Jam?
We don't play world music.
Do we?

02:54.917 --> 02:56.417
Yes. Where's
New Zealand from

02:56.417 --> 02:58.250
- if it's not
from the world?
- ( Jemaine groans )

02:58.250 --> 03:00.250
- Come on.
- But before Wu-Ta,

03:00.250 --> 03:02.917
let's bring on
Lisa Valenzuela from Mexico.

03:02.917 --> 03:05.792
- Let's hear it for Lisa.
- ( cheering )

03:07.583 --> 03:09.083
There's a lot
of hot women here.

03:09.083 --> 03:10.917
- Yeah.
- ( Lisa singing in Spanish )

03:10.917 --> 03:12.959
Look at those two.

03:12.959 --> 03:15.291
Whoa.
Whew.

It's been a delightful night.
Thank you very much.

06:49.291 --> 06:50.959
Hey, guys.
Really good.

- ( polka music playing )
- Different start
to the song.

06:53.458 --> 06:55.458
- What were you doing there?
- No, it's the same.

06:58.917 --> 07:00.542
- Well, we were tuning.
- Oh, okay.

07:00.542 --> 07:02.542
That was good.
Okay, so here you are.

07:02.542 --> 07:05.041
- I bought you guys a beer.
- I don't even drink beer.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.917
- I don't drink it either.
- Just drink it, will you?

07:06.917 --> 07:09.500
- It's good for
the rock and roll image.
- No, I prefer water.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.750
- Hey, guys.
- Hang on, Mel.

07:10.750 --> 07:12.667
Bret, I know you don't
like it, but we need it--

07:12.667 --> 07:15.166
- It tastes disgusting.
- Just drink it.
It's good for the image.

07:15.166 --> 07:17.542
I do things for my image--
make it more rock and roll

07:17.542 --> 07:19.125
with the goatee
and everything.

07:19.125 --> 07:21.333
I don't like this goatee.
I hate it.

07:21.333 --> 07:23.333
Makes you look like
a goat, doesn't it?

07:23.333 --> 07:26.834
Yeah, exactly.
But you've gotta make
sacrifices for success.

07:28.667 --> 07:30.375
Okay? Go on,
just have a sip.

07:30.375 --> 07:32.083
All right.

07:32.083 --> 07:34.000
( slurps )

07:34.000 --> 07:35.458
There we go.
You look cool!

07:35.458 --> 07:37.375
- Can I have a go?
- Yeah.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.250
That's it. Yeah.
See, Jemaine's got it.

07:41.250 --> 07:42.917
Think about
something happy.

07:42.917 --> 07:45.709
I need to go
to the toilet.

07:45.709 --> 07:47.250
What if I go like--
what if I do

07:47.250 --> 07:49.208
- some sort of
thing like this?
- I like that.

07:49.208 --> 07:51.000
Murray:
That's over the top.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.709
- Jemaine: Is it?
- Murray: Yeah.

07:52.709 --> 07:54.250
( audience applauding )

07:54.250 --> 07:57.083
Hey, Jemaine, those girls
are looking over at us.

07:57.083 --> 07:59.333
Jemaine:
Do you think they
might be looking at me.

07:59.333 --> 08:00.792
They're looking
at all of us!

08:00.792 --> 08:03.000
Tell you what,
maybe if I pretend
to go to the toilet,

08:03.000 --> 08:04.792
you guys see if
they're looking at me.

08:04.792 --> 08:06.709
- Okay?
- Yep.

08:11.333 --> 08:12.959
No, they're not
looking at me!

08:12.959 --> 08:15.041
I might actually
go to the toilet now
that I'm over here!

08:15.041 --> 08:17.041
- Jemaine: Okay. Okay
- Okay, cool.

08:17.041 --> 08:20.917
For the dinner that I won,
I was wondering if you liked
arugula or romaine lettuce.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.500
Hey. Hey, we were
at your show earlier.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.583
- Hey.
- I really like
that one you did

08:25.583 --> 08:28.792
- about how you liked
to rock the party.
- Oh, yes.

08:28.792 --> 08:30.917
- I like to rock the party.
- Oh!

08:30.917 --> 08:33.542
You must have been really
wasted when you wrote that.

08:33.542 --> 08:35.458
- No.
- Do you mean on drugs?

08:35.458 --> 08:37.917
Oh, yes, we were tripping

08:37.917 --> 08:39.750
- When we wrote that one,
that's right.
- Oh.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.625
We were totally
whacked off.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.875
- What?
- Whacked off?

08:43.875 --> 08:47.000
Uh, that's just a drug term
we use back in New Zealand

08:47.000 --> 08:50.083
when we're out of it.
We say, "Oh, man,
I was whacked off...

08:50.083 --> 08:51.917
- Girl: Cool.
- ...last night."

08:51.917 --> 08:54.125
Hello.
I'm Murray Hewitt.

08:54.125 --> 08:55.500
I manage the guys.

08:55.500 --> 08:59.583
Well, it was really
great to talk to you guys!

09:00.417 --> 09:02.125
- Whoa.
- A fan of ours.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.709
Hey, do you want
to join the fan list?

09:03.709 --> 09:06.458
Here we are.
Here's a card
with our website on.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.291
And you can get online
and e-mail the guys

09:08.291 --> 09:09.834
and they'll
reply to you.

09:09.834 --> 09:11.834
- All right,
see you guys later.
- Okay, see you.

09:11.834 --> 09:15.458
- All right.
- You are a real
rock and roll band.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.583
- Bret: Good night.
- Bye.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.125
Well, how about that, eh?

09:24.125 --> 09:27.166
A real rock and roll band.
That'll be the beer, you see?

09:27.166 --> 09:29.500
- Yeah.
- Yeah, my goatee probably
would've helped as well.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.625
- I think it was more the beer.
- They weren't even looking
at your goatee.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.208
Yes they were.
One of them was.

09:34.208 --> 09:36.291
It's all part of the image.
This is working well.

09:36.291 --> 09:37.959
Just need to
build on it now.

09:42.125 --> 09:44.333
Dave, we need to borrow
some of your cool clothes.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.083
You want to
borrow my clothes?

09:47.083 --> 09:48.834
Yeah, I need
something that's cool

09:48.834 --> 09:50.250
but also sexy.

09:50.250 --> 09:53.208
Oh, I got just the thing.
I got a shirt that's got a mouse

09:53.208 --> 09:56.709
having sex with another
mouse in a mousetrap.

09:56.709 --> 09:59.166
I score chicks in this
shirt all the time.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.000
Let me find it.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.500
It must be
in here somewhere.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.166
Here it is.

10:05.166 --> 10:07.208
There you go.

10:07.208 --> 10:08.667
Huh?

10:08.667 --> 10:10.500
- Bret: Yeah--
- No, no, I guarantee you,

10:10.500 --> 10:13.000
I was just pumping away
in this thing the other night.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.458
- Okay.
- Will that definitely work?

10:15.458 --> 10:17.250
Oh, for sure.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.709
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:18.709 --> 10:20.834
Uh, I was hoping to dress
something like Prince.

10:20.834 --> 10:22.375
Kind of erogenous, huh?

10:22.375 --> 10:24.208
Yeah, but toned
down a bit, like,

10:24.208 --> 10:26.917
Prince if he was
just going to the zoo
or the supermarket.

10:26.917 --> 10:29.041
- Casual Prince?
- Jemaine: Casual Prince.

10:29.041 --> 10:30.709
Hang on a sec.

10:33.917 --> 10:36.417
( woman speaking Hindi )

10:36.417 --> 10:37.500
Dave: Shh!

10:37.500 --> 10:39.458
( Dave speaking Hindi )

10:39.458 --> 10:40.583
Jesus!

10:40.583 --> 10:44.041
Sorry guys.
My roommate's...

10:44.041 --> 10:45.542
being kind of a jerk.

10:45.542 --> 10:47.375
But look,
I got you this.

10:47.375 --> 10:48.709
Is that
a woman's blouse?

10:48.709 --> 10:50.667
- No.
- Looks like a blouse.

10:50.667 --> 10:52.625
No no no.
This is what you're
looking for, man.

10:52.625 --> 10:54.083
That's totally Prince.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.667
And if you accessorize
with these belts--

10:55.667 --> 10:57.709
I brought two, depending
on what shoes you wear.

10:57.709 --> 10:59.041
Okay, man, thanks.

10:59.041 --> 11:01.417
Yeah, no problem.
And maybe hide that

11:01.417 --> 11:03.083
on your way out 'cause...

11:03.083 --> 11:05.375
if my roommate sees--
I mean, she is crazy.

11:05.375 --> 11:07.417
( whispers )
She thinks she's my mom.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.458
- That is your mom.
- ( chuckles )

11:09.458 --> 11:11.834
Dude, you think
I live with my parents?

11:11.834 --> 11:13.959
- Oh, is that
your dad, though?
- No.

11:13.959 --> 11:17.083
That's just some old,
crotchety Indian couple

11:17.083 --> 11:18.750
that I sublet to.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.792
The weird thing is
they look like me.

11:20.792 --> 11:22.709
They've got
photos of themselves

11:22.709 --> 11:24.083
with you as a kid.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.250
( whispers )
I know.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.792
It's creepy.

11:27.792 --> 11:30.250
I think they make them
on the computer.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.959
See? Now I just
reply as you, Bret.

11:38.917 --> 11:41.750
"That sounds great."

11:44.583 --> 11:47.709
And she'll just reply
in a couple of minutes.

11:47.709 --> 11:49.083
And look at this.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.125
Bret:
That's-- that's our bedroom.

11:51.125 --> 11:53.875
Murray:
Yep. That's a live
webcam from your bedroom.

11:53.875 --> 11:56.625
- What?
- Fan base loves it.

11:56.625 --> 11:58.750
Actually, Jemaine,
I've had a really good response

11:58.750 --> 12:01.166
from something that happened
with you when you were
alone with the webcam.

12:01.166 --> 12:02.625
Do you know what
that would be?

12:02.625 --> 12:04.458
I didn't know
we had a webcam.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.750
Okay, well, whatever
you're doing, just be
careful, all right?

12:06.750 --> 12:10.125
- What are you implying?
- Well, if I had a webcam
above my bed,

12:10.125 --> 12:11.959
sometimes I might,
you know, forget
it's turned on.

12:11.959 --> 12:13.417
I didn't know
we had a webcam.

12:13.417 --> 12:16.542
I think I might sleep
in the lounge from now on.

12:16.542 --> 12:19.834
Oh, okay. Well, here we go.
There's the lounge.

12:19.834 --> 12:23.500
All right?
Now item three...

12:23.500 --> 12:25.792
the new fans.
We've tripled the fan base.

12:25.792 --> 12:27.458
So we need two new
t-shirts made up.

12:27.458 --> 12:30.583
Who wants to
take care of that?

12:30.583 --> 12:31.834
You?

12:31.834 --> 12:34.834
Okay, good.
I was hoping for that.

12:34.834 --> 12:37.375
Murray, t-shirts.

12:37.375 --> 12:38.917
All right,
that's everything.

12:38.917 --> 12:41.750
Oh, and you've got dinner with
Mel tonight, so don't forget.

12:41.750 --> 12:43.083
We can't go tonight.

12:43.083 --> 12:44.750
What do you mean
you can't go, Jemaine?

12:44.750 --> 12:47.125
We've got a double date
with those new fans--
Summer and Rain.

12:47.125 --> 12:49.166
You can't cancel it.
It's the competition.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.166
She's cooking
your favorites.

12:51.166 --> 12:52.667
Scrambled eggs
for you, Bret.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.750
- And anything
for you, Jemaine.
- Really?

12:54.750 --> 12:56.750
- Hmm.
- Yes!

12:56.750 --> 12:59.083
You can't just neglect
your old fans like that.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.542
What happens when
the new fans fly the coop?

13:01.542 --> 13:03.166
You'll end up like
ZZ Top.

13:03.166 --> 13:05.000
- What are you talking about?
- You know, ZZ Top.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.041
- Yeah?
- They sang the song
about the-- the--

13:07.041 --> 13:09.333
the woman with the legs.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.083
Anyway, they grew big beards,

13:11.083 --> 13:12.625
their old fans
didn't like it.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.375
The new fans didn't
like them without the beards,

13:14.375 --> 13:17.709
and then they had a
do-we-have-a-beard-
or-not situation.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.500
- Is this relevant?
- Yes!

13:19.500 --> 13:21.542
You have to go
to the dinner, Jemaine.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.709
Mmm.

13:26.709 --> 13:29.375
Mel, these scrambled eggs
are terrific.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.625
Thank you, Bret.

13:31.625 --> 13:34.875
Yeah, thanks for the food.
It's really nice.

13:34.875 --> 13:36.166
Thank you.

13:36.166 --> 13:37.625
Um, what was
your name again?

13:37.625 --> 13:40.041
- It's Rain.
- Mel: Oh.

13:40.041 --> 13:43.125
That's nice, like--
kind of like bad weather.

13:43.125 --> 13:45.041
I remember your name
from the fan list.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.709
I check it regularly.
Do you check it regularly?

13:47.709 --> 13:49.250
- No.
- Mel: No.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.041
Do you not have
a computer, or...

13:51.041 --> 13:53.208
- Rain: No, I do
have a computer.
- Oh, you can't read.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.542
Isn't it great having
all the fans together?

13:55.542 --> 13:57.166
- Yes.
- Bret: Isn't this--

13:57.166 --> 14:00.083
Isn't this good, and--
scrambled eggs.

14:00.083 --> 14:02.000
Yeah.
Hey, by the way,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.875
it was really great
to win the prize

14:03.875 --> 14:06.625
to have dinner with just
the two  of you tonight.

14:06.625 --> 14:09.166
- Mmm.
- Con-- congratulations.

14:09.166 --> 14:10.750
Mmm. Well done.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.917
So, who's the old dude
in the photo with you?

14:15.041 --> 14:17.083
That's my husband Doug.

14:17.083 --> 14:20.291
Oh, I thought
he was your dad.

14:20.291 --> 14:22.750
He's a little bit
older than me.

14:22.750 --> 14:24.709
- Summer: Yeah.
- He was my college professor.

14:24.709 --> 14:27.458
I remember seeing him
on the first day of college.

14:27.458 --> 14:29.041
He was so dapper

14:29.041 --> 14:30.792
and so knowledgeable.

14:30.792 --> 14:33.417
And I just had
to have him.

14:33.417 --> 14:36.291
He resisted for a while
and there were some legal...

14:36.291 --> 14:37.625
boundaries, you know,

14:37.625 --> 14:41.625
keeping me from
being near him or...

14:41.625 --> 14:43.667
his family, but...

14:43.667 --> 14:46.250
in the end,
love overcame.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.083
And I got what I wanted.

14:50.834 --> 14:52.583
I always get what I want.

14:54.208 --> 14:57.291
( giggles )
Hey, Mel, do you
have any beer?

14:57.291 --> 14:58.792
- Oh, yeah, I'd like a beer.
- Yeah.

14:58.792 --> 15:00.375
Mmm, that would be great.

15:00.375 --> 15:03.125
- But you don't
drink beer, Bret.
- I drink it all the time.

15:03.125 --> 15:04.583
I could drink
a whole glass of beer.

15:04.583 --> 15:07.625
I thought it always
made you go to the toilet.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.500
No. Nope.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.041
I'll have a big,
delicious beer.

15:14.041 --> 15:16.291
Excuse me.
I'll get your beers.

15:16.291 --> 15:19.750
Have a gallon--
have a gallon of it.

15:19.750 --> 15:22.333
- Hey, guys, watch this.
- Oh, yeah.

15:30.834 --> 15:32.500
( coughing )

15:37.333 --> 15:39.500
- Summer: Great.
- Thanks, Mel.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.625
- Thank you, Mel.
- Mm-hmm.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.500
- Mel: There's your beer.
- Yum!

15:44.500 --> 15:46.834
Yum!
That's good. Wow.

15:49.542 --> 15:51.834
I just need to go to
the toilet. Excuse me.

16:03.250 --> 16:05.750
Bret:
Oh. Oh, hi, Doug.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.166
Oh, hey, Bret.

16:07.166 --> 16:08.959
Are you gonna
come up for dinner?

16:08.959 --> 16:12.750
Uh, no. This is
Mel's special day.

16:12.750 --> 16:14.333
Besides, I'm--
I'm happy down here.

16:14.333 --> 16:17.041
- Are you sure you don't
want to come up for--
- Yeah yeah.

16:17.041 --> 16:19.792
Yeah, I got
a lot of work to do.

16:19.792 --> 16:22.125
- You know, so...
- Okay.

16:22.125 --> 16:24.041
- See you, Doug.
- Uh, Bret,

16:24.041 --> 16:26.542
don't mention
that you saw me here.

16:26.542 --> 16:28.500
Okay.

16:31.375 --> 16:34.500
Bret! Hey, Bret,
can I have a quick
word with you?

16:34.500 --> 16:37.208
Those girls, I don't
trust them, Bret.

16:37.208 --> 16:40.250
They have no interest
in you as musicians.

16:40.250 --> 16:41.834
- They just want to--
- Just want to what?

16:41.834 --> 16:44.458
( whispers )
They want to do it
with you, Bret.

16:44.458 --> 16:47.500
- Sex?
- Yes.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.917
And I know your policy
on sexual relations
with fans, Bret.

16:50.917 --> 16:52.917
I've got to go
to the bathroom, Mel.

16:53.750 --> 16:55.875
Bret, I know--

16:55.875 --> 16:57.959
( urinating )

16:57.959 --> 17:00.250
( doorknob rattling )

17:01.041 --> 17:02.709
It's just that, Bret,

17:02.709 --> 17:06.291
I just hope that you'll
make sure that they
respect your boundaries.

17:06.291 --> 17:08.166
- Thank you, Mel. Okay.
- Yeah.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.709
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:09.709 --> 17:11.625
Are you okay?
Do you need any help with--

17:11.625 --> 17:14.000
- Uh, can you please leave?
- Oh, you don't need any help?

17:14.000 --> 17:17.792
- I-- I'm going
to the toilet, yeah.
- Everything's fine with you?

17:17.792 --> 17:19.875
Okay, great.

17:26.375 --> 17:29.333
( classical music playing )

17:31.083 --> 17:33.750
Jemaine, Mel thinks they're
not interested in the band,

17:33.750 --> 17:36.041
they're interested in sex.

17:36.041 --> 17:37.917
( pop music playing )

17:37.917 --> 17:41.333
- Jemaine: Sorry we
have to run off, Mel.
- Bret: That was delicious!

17:41.333 --> 17:43.458
Congratulations on the prize.

17:43.458 --> 17:47.583
Okay, well,
I wish you'd stay!

17:47.583 --> 17:51.166
- I made a lot of dessert!
I made tapioca pudding.
- Jemaine: Bye!

17:51.166 --> 17:53.750
Angel food cake!

18:00.709 --> 18:02.875
So, uh, you guys
want to get whacked off?

18:02.875 --> 18:05.750
- What?
- Yeah.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.834
Whacked off, you know,
do some drugs.

18:08.583 --> 18:10.000
- Mmm.
- Oh.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.417
Yeah, do you guys
want to do some acid?

18:12.417 --> 18:14.333
Um, I have a cold.

18:14.333 --> 18:15.792
- So I won't.
- Yeah.

18:15.792 --> 18:17.667
I've also got
the same cold.
It's airborne.

18:17.667 --> 18:19.542
You could just have
a half if you want.

18:19.542 --> 18:23.375
- Yeah...
- I'll just have
a half as well.

18:23.375 --> 18:26.583
- Bret: Oh, give
Jemaine that big half.
- I couldn't have all that.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.834
Uh, no.

18:27.834 --> 18:29.917
I'm-- I've just had
a big pasta salad.

18:29.917 --> 18:31.583
I'm full.

18:31.583 --> 18:33.458
Maybe just half
my half again.

18:33.458 --> 18:35.834
- I'll just have a 16th.
- Rain: Okay.

18:35.834 --> 18:38.000
A 16th for you.

18:40.041 --> 18:41.667
A 16th for you.

18:41.667 --> 18:43.417
Oh, thank you.
Is that it?

18:43.417 --> 18:46.000
No, that's a dry
piece of skin.
You dropped it.

18:47.917 --> 18:50.208
There you go.
Go on.

18:52.083 --> 18:53.750
Lick it!

18:58.375 --> 19:01.375
- Ready, Bret?
- Yeah.

19:07.208 --> 19:08.542
Oh, flub!

I'll see you later.

21:01.709 --> 21:04.500
- Jemaine.
- Hmm?

21:04.500 --> 21:06.625
I'm really
kind of nervous.

21:06.625 --> 21:08.166
How come?

21:08.166 --> 21:10.667
I'm going to suggest
that we have a threesome.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.834
Oh.

21:18.834 --> 21:21.625
I just have to go
and talk to Bret quickly.

21:21.625 --> 21:25.458
( waves crashing )

21:27.000 --> 21:28.583
- Bret.
- Get out.

21:28.583 --> 21:32.208
- I'm having an acid reflux.
- Bret, you got to go home.

21:32.208 --> 21:33.542
- Why?
- You got to go home.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.250
Because I've been
offered a threesome.

21:36.250 --> 21:38.709
- What about me?
- No, you're not included.

21:38.709 --> 21:41.542
- Go home. Go home.
- Well, I can't just
walk out of here.

21:41.542 --> 21:43.166
Just-- just make an excuse.

21:43.166 --> 21:45.417
See you later, man.
See you at home.

21:47.208 --> 21:48.959
( sighs )
This doesn't look like Prince.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.875
Well, thanks very much
for a delightful evening,

21:50.875 --> 21:53.709
but unfortunately
I've gotta go 'cause I've
got a doctor's appointment.

21:53.709 --> 21:56.458
- At night?
- Yeah.

21:56.458 --> 21:58.834
Bret, do you want
to have a threesome?

22:00.625 --> 22:03.875
Oh. Just one second.

22:06.375 --> 22:08.250
Bret, get out.
What are you doing here?

22:08.250 --> 22:10.417
You got it wrong.
They want me in the threesome.

22:10.417 --> 22:12.542
What?
That's not a threesome,
that's a foursome.

22:12.542 --> 22:14.542
I don't know.
I've never had a threesome.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.250
I don't want you in my
threesome, you don't know
anything about threesomes.

22:17.250 --> 22:20.166
- You ever had a threesome?
- Nearly.

22:20.166 --> 22:21.750
What you mean, nearly?

22:21.750 --> 22:24.667
- I had a twosome.
- Wow. What was that like?

22:24.667 --> 22:27.041
Great. I've done it
several times, man.

22:27.041 --> 22:29.959
- Just one of you
there, then one--
- Yeah.

22:29.959 --> 22:31.375
Oh no, I've had a twosome!

22:31.375 --> 22:32.917
- That's just the normal way.
- Yes.

22:32.917 --> 22:35.166
Yeah, I've done that.
I've had a one-way
and a two-way.

22:35.166 --> 22:37.792
- This is my big chance
to have a three-way.
- No, it's my big chance.

22:37.792 --> 22:39.583
- You've got to go,
you took too long.
- What?

22:39.583 --> 22:41.208
You snooze, you lose, man.

22:41.208 --> 22:43.834
You're gonna have to go,
make an excuse. Say you
got a driving lesson.

22:43.834 --> 22:46.250
- Get out of here.
- I can't believe you.

22:49.375 --> 22:52.083
Uh, I'm sorry
I have to go.

22:52.083 --> 22:54.625
I have a late-night
driving lesson.

22:54.625 --> 22:57.041
- Summer, where's Rain?
- Oh, Rain went home.

22:57.041 --> 22:59.959
She didn't want
to be here while we were
all having a threesome.

22:59.959 --> 23:03.625
- You, me...
- And Jemaine.

23:03.625 --> 23:06.208
Bret:
Jemaine, can I have a word
with you in the bathroom?

23:06.208 --> 23:07.959
Is it impolite not to do it

23:07.959 --> 23:09.834
considering she's offered
and it's her place?

23:09.834 --> 23:11.500
No.
Can't do it. No.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.458
- I won't do it.
- What, you're not doing it?

23:13.458 --> 23:15.500
- No way.
- Well, if you're not
doing it, I might do it.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.792
- Are you gonna do it?
- Yeah, why not?
I'm gonna go for it.

23:17.792 --> 23:19.834
- Okay, let's do it.
- No, don't do it.

23:19.834 --> 23:23.291
- What? Don't do it.
I'm gonna do it.
- Okay, let's do it.

23:23.291 --> 23:25.333
- I'm not gonna do it if you
do it. Are you doing it?
- You're not doing it?

23:25.333 --> 23:27.375
- No.
- Okay, I won't do it.

23:27.375 --> 23:30.875
Well, if you're not
doing it, then I think I'm--
yeah, I'm gonna do it.

23:30.875 --> 23:33.959
Yeah, but if you
do it and I'm not there,
you're back to a two-way.

23:33.959 --> 23:35.834
Oh, yes, you're right.

23:35.834 --> 23:39.125
I think we should
just go in there and say
thank you and then go home.

23:39.125 --> 23:40.667
No, we'll feel
obliged to do it.

23:40.667 --> 23:43.500
Let's just
climb out the window
and go home. Come on.

23:49.041 --> 23:50.959
Oh, hi, Summer.

23:50.959 --> 23:53.291
- Hey.
- Jemaine: Bret,
what are you doing?

23:53.291 --> 23:55.834
Um... yeah.

23:55.834 --> 23:57.333
- Um...
- Oh, hey.

23:57.333 --> 24:00.208
Again, just want
to say thank you for
a delightful evening.

24:00.208 --> 24:02.959
- Thanks for the acids.
- And the offer
of the threesome.

24:02.959 --> 24:05.375
- And, um...
- Really wonderful night.

24:13.750 --> 24:16.417
- Okay, Bret.
- Yes.

24:16.417 --> 24:18.250
- Jemaine.
- Yes.

24:18.250 --> 24:20.041
Murray, present.

24:20.041 --> 24:22.041
Now, what happened last night?

24:22.041 --> 24:23.625
The new fans
gave us illegal drugs

24:23.625 --> 24:26.125
- and wanted to have
a threesome with us.
- Whoa, really?

24:26.125 --> 24:28.417
- Jemaine: mmm.
- That's pretty
rock and roll.

24:28.417 --> 24:32.041
- No, it was very awkward.
- We don't want to have sex
with each other in the--

24:32.041 --> 24:35.500
You can't e-mail the fans
and tell them we're gonna
have man-man-lady threesomes.

24:35.500 --> 24:38.041
Yeah, it's not--
you can't-- you just
can't do that, Murray.

24:38.041 --> 24:39.458
Well, look, just
to let you know, all right,

24:39.458 --> 24:41.500
that sort of behavior
is actually the norm.

24:41.500 --> 24:44.250
- It's standard practice.
- What, for the manager
to e-mail the fans

24:44.250 --> 24:46.208
and offer them
man-man-lady threesome?

24:46.208 --> 24:48.750
You'll be offered drugs.
You'll have threesomes,

24:48.750 --> 24:50.166
dinners, you know?

24:50.166 --> 24:52.208
You'll end up going
into town in a taxi,

24:52.208 --> 24:55.208
have a couple of drugs,
have dinner, have a threesome,

24:55.208 --> 24:56.542
go home again.

24:56.542 --> 24:58.542
Have a shower,
go out again,

24:58.542 --> 25:00.041
more drugs,

25:00.041 --> 25:02.458
more threesomes--
happens all the time.

25:02.458 --> 25:04.792
- All right?
I mean, I'd do it.
- Yeah, we did--

25:04.792 --> 25:07.250
Okay, now look, you've
lost your fan list now.

25:07.250 --> 25:09.667
The two new fans have
dropped out of the gang.

25:09.667 --> 25:11.917
- We still got Mel.
- Nope, she's gone as well.

25:11.917 --> 25:13.458
- She's off the list.
- Jemaine: Really?

25:13.458 --> 25:16.208
- Yes.
- How many fans
have we got now?

25:16.208 --> 25:18.875
None. Empty club.

25:18.875 --> 25:22.208
I've put a note here--
no one.

25:22.208 --> 25:24.250
Oh no, here we go.
Perhaps here, Jemaine,

25:24.250 --> 25:26.667
- Would you like
to join the list?
- Yes.

25:26.667 --> 25:28.083
Yeah? Okay.

25:28.083 --> 25:30.709
What about you, Bret?
Can you join the fan list?

25:31.458 --> 25:32.667
No way.

25:32.667 --> 25:35.542
No, I'm just not a fan
of the band at all.

25:37.250 --> 25:39.583
Hey, Jemaine.

25:41.542 --> 25:43.583
Hmm?

25:43.583 --> 25:45.709
Last night,
did you... look?

25:45.709 --> 25:48.458
We agreed never
to talk about this.

25:48.458 --> 25:50.291
- Yeah, but did you look?
- I didn't look.

25:50.291 --> 25:52.959
- Did you look?
- No, I had my eyes shut
most of the time.

25:52.959 --> 25:54.667
What do you mean
most of the time?

25:54.667 --> 25:57.333
I opened them a little bit
so I could see what
I was doing.

25:57.333 --> 25:59.000
Good night, Bret.
Go to sleep.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.667
What were you doing
with that chair?

26:00.667 --> 26:02.458
Oh, yeah yeah.

26:02.458 --> 26:03.959
I took a rest for a while.

26:03.959 --> 26:05.750
You weren't
in the threesome?

26:05.750 --> 26:07.583
No, I was resting.

26:07.583 --> 26:10.458
Actually, me and her both
took a break for a while.

26:10.458 --> 26:12.291
You were just
up there by yourself.

26:12.291 --> 26:15.333
( phone ringing )

26:15.333 --> 26:18.250
- Hello?
- Murray: Go to sleep, guys.
Stop chatting.

26:18.250 --> 26:20.375
- All right, Murray.
- Good night.

26:20.375 --> 26:22.542
- Good night.
- Say good night for me.

26:22.542 --> 26:24.375
Just wave at him.

26:24.375 --> 26:27.667
- Say goodnight to Mel.
- All right.

26:27.667 --> 26:29.834
Good night, Mel.

26:33.333 --> 26:35.625
Good night.
