WEBVTT

00:00.668 --> 00:02.294
[knock on door]

00:02.336 --> 00:03.963
- Hey.

00:02.336 --> 00:03.963
- Hey, you back.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.464
- Ready?

00:04.004 --> 00:05.464
- Almost.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.675
I just have to find my keys

00:05.506 --> 00:07.675
and finish the laundry.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.217
That doesn't sound

00:07.716 --> 00:09.217
like almost.

00:09.259 --> 00:11.010
It sounds like we're gonna

00:09.259 --> 00:11.010
have to speed to the movies

00:11.052 --> 00:12.596
park illegally

00:11.052 --> 00:12.596
and you hit the bathroom

00:12.638 --> 00:14.139
while I grab the popcorn.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.183
We'll meet back at the seats

00:14.181 --> 00:16.183
all sweaty and aggravated.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.768
Well, of course

00:16.224 --> 00:17.768
I'll be aggravated.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.060
You forgot the Red Vines.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.688
No. No keys here.

00:20.729 --> 00:21.730
You know the lights

00:20.729 --> 00:21.730
are on in your jeep.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.106
Oh, yeah.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.441
The porch light's out,

00:23.148 --> 00:24.441
and it was dark

00:24.483 --> 00:25.734
so I left the jeep

00:24.483 --> 00:25.734
on for the light.

00:25.776 --> 00:26.777
- Could you lift, please?

00:25.776 --> 00:26.777
- Yeah.

00:26.819 --> 00:28.069
But the battery's gonna die.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.488
No, no, I timed it.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.782
It takes 12 hours for

00:29.530 --> 00:31.782
the battery to wear out.

00:31.824 --> 00:34.785
I go to work at 8:00,

00:31.824 --> 00:34.785
giving me 2 hours to spare

00:34.827 --> 00:36.411
and a whole day to recharge.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.872
Not here, either. Down, please.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.414
Why don't you just

00:37.913 --> 00:39.414
change the porch light?

00:39.456 --> 00:40.916
Have you seen

00:39.456 --> 00:40.916
how dirty it is up there

00:40.958 --> 00:42.918
with those creepy moths

00:40.958 --> 00:42.918
that fly in your face?

00:42.960 --> 00:44.419
And you could swallow one

00:44.461 --> 00:46.338
and end up with weird

00:44.461 --> 00:46.338
hand-to-mouth-to-moth disease.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.631
There's no such thing.

00:47.673 --> 00:49.717
Oh, no. Did you see

00:47.673 --> 00:49.717
"Mothman Prophecies"?

00:49.758 --> 00:51.468
- Yes.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.468
- Oh, well, okay then.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.052
- Did you see the sequel?

00:51.510 --> 00:53.052
- There's a sequel?

00:53.094 --> 00:55.138
Yes, it is a heartbreaking saga

00:55.180 --> 00:57.558
in which Richard Gere

00:55.180 --> 00:57.558
gets a life-threatening disease

00:57.599 --> 00:58.767
from changing

00:57.599 --> 00:58.767
a dirty porch light.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.143
There was no sequel.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.603
Well, it's still

01:00.185 --> 01:01.603
really gross up there.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.230
How long has it been out?

01:03.271 --> 01:05.024
Uh, since Rory broke up

01:03.271 --> 01:05.024
with Dean the first time.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.400
- Not the sequel.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.400
- Yes.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.694
He was the last one

01:06.441 --> 01:08.694
to change it.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.196
Jess never changed

01:08.736 --> 01:11.196
the porch light, by the way.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.657
Okay, this room

01:11.238 --> 01:13.657
is definitely keyless. Kitchen.

01:13.699 --> 01:16.284
[humming]

01:18.161 --> 01:19.955
You left your keys in the stove?

01:19.997 --> 01:21.289
No. My socks.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.751
Your socks. Of course.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.751
How naive of me.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.169
It makes them warm

01:23.792 --> 01:26.169
and slightly toasty.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.295
- Huh. That's weird.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.295
- What's weird?

01:27.337 --> 01:28.881
There's so much to choose from.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.966
They're still damp.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.966
I followed the recipe.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.927
Bake at 250, 10 minutes

01:31.008 --> 01:32.927
one side, 10 the other.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.762
They should be done by now.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.762
You think my oven's broken?

01:34.803 --> 01:36.847
- What about your dryer?

01:34.803 --> 01:36.847
- No, the dryer's fine.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.057
I think we should

01:36.889 --> 01:38.057
get to the movies.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.767
- All done. Let's go.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.767
- Keys.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.560
Ah! Forget about them.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.560
Just leave the door unlocked.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.811
We can't leave

01:41.602 --> 01:42.811
the door unlocked.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.312
- That's not safe.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.312
- Sure it is.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.564
Just because you say

01:44.354 --> 01:45.564
it's safe doesn't make it safe.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.732
If you build it, they will come.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.442
Have you checked out by the..

01:48.483 --> 01:49.484
The keys are in the door.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.653
Ah! They are? That's right.

01:51.695 --> 01:52.947
I had to go in the back way

01:52.988 --> 01:54.615
because the porch light was out.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.451
- They're stuck.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.451
- Yeah, yeah, that happens.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.996
There.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.330
You ready?

02:02.372 --> 02:04.875
I can never pick

02:02.372 --> 02:04.875

about you last night.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.225
If this gets dirty, feel free

03:02.557 --> 03:04.225
to keep it to yourself.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.769
I dreamt that

03:04.267 --> 03:05.769
in spite of the fact

03:05.811 --> 03:07.270
that you knew I wanted to be

03:05.811 --> 03:07.270
assigned the religion beat

03:07.312 --> 03:08.689
you went behind my back to Doyle

03:08.730 --> 03:10.398
cooked him dinner,

03:08.730 --> 03:10.398
and stole it from me.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.526
- It's just a dream, Paris.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.526
- You made veal parmesan.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.736
- And it felt very real.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.736
- I don't make veal parmesan.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.655
I don't make anything, and I

03:14.778 --> 03:16.655
don't want the religion beat.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.157
I want features. You know that.

03:18.197 --> 03:19.700
- You say you want features.

03:18.197 --> 03:19.700
- And I mean it.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.284
Dreams tell you things.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.495
It's our subconscious

03:21.326 --> 03:23.495
talking to us, warning us

03:23.537 --> 03:25.455
telling us about things

03:23.537 --> 03:25.455
that are happening.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.166
My dream was telling me

03:25.497 --> 03:27.166
that you were stabbing me

03:27.206 --> 03:28.500
in the back

03:27.206 --> 03:28.500
with your veal parmesan.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.960
Well, I must have really

03:28.542 --> 03:29.960
overcooked it, then.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.586
- Let me smell your hands.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.586
- Oh, go away.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.297
You used a lot of garlic.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.297
Rory, listen to me.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.966
We're close, like friends

03:36.008 --> 03:37.718
and I would hate

03:36.008 --> 03:37.718
for something as trivial as

03:37.759 --> 03:39.427
competition for the religion

03:37.759 --> 03:39.427
beat to come between us.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.055
Oh, my God! I don't

03:39.469 --> 03:41.055
want the religion beat.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.764
We could end up

03:41.096 --> 03:42.764
like the Van Burens.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.475
- As in Mr. and Mrs. President?

03:42.806 --> 03:45.475
- As in Abby and Ann.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.352
Sisters in blood,

03:45.517 --> 03:47.352
but bitter rivals.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.478
They don't even speak anymore.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.271
That's 'cause

03:48.520 --> 03:50.271
one of them's dead.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.690
You don't want

03:50.313 --> 03:51.690
the religion beat?

03:51.732 --> 03:54.985
Oh. I'm sorry.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.985
You meant the<i> religion</i> beat.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.444
No! I don't!

03:56.486 --> 03:58.113
Sanora Thomas

03:56.486 --> 03:58.113
was in my dream, too.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.781
She was pouring the wine.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.781
Yo, Sanora!

03:59.823 --> 04:01.200
Where's the fire?

04:01.241 --> 04:02.450
Hey Rory,

04:01.241 --> 04:02.450
did you see this?

04:02.492 --> 04:03.994
- See what?

04:02.492 --> 04:03.994
- It's no big deal.

04:04.036 --> 04:06.205
Glenn got himself published

04:04.036 --> 04:06.205
in "The New York Times."

04:06.246 --> 04:07.748
- You're kidding.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.748
- It's no big deal.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.166
"It's no big deal," he says.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.709
Oh, but this

04:09.208 --> 04:10.709
is the article you wrote

04:10.751 --> 04:12.335
about the reprinting

04:10.751 --> 04:12.335
of the anarchist cookbook.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.171
- It's no big deal.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.171
- This was in our last issue.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.214
And "The Times" picked it up.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.548
They do that every now and then.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.966
They pick up something,

04:16.590 --> 04:17.966
and they publish it.

04:18.008 --> 04:19.801
And that's what they did

04:18.008 --> 04:19.801
with our boy Glenn here.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.137
Please don't pat my back again.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.680
Well, congratulations, Glenn.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.015
Don't say it loud.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.015
People are looking.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.725
- You should be proud.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.725
- Why?

04:26.767 --> 04:28.476
- It's not even my best piece.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.476
- It's still pretty amazing.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.270
It is amazing.

04:30.311 --> 04:32.981
It's absolutely amazing that

04:30.311 --> 04:32.981
I spent all summer in Indiana

04:33.023 --> 04:35.150
working my ass off with

04:33.023 --> 04:35.150
the Muncie messenger

04:35.192 --> 04:36.860
'and you went from

04:35.192 --> 04:36.860
Star Trek Convention'

04:36.902 --> 04:39.529
to Boba Fett Fan Club Symposium,

04:36.902 --> 04:39.529
and, yet, looky here.

04:39.571 --> 04:42.282
"The New York Times."

04:39.571 --> 04:42.282
isn't that great, Rory?

04:42.323 --> 04:43.951
Aren't you seeing

04:42.323 --> 04:43.951
how great it is?

04:43.992 --> 04:46.661
Look, get off my bus, okay?

04:43.992 --> 04:46.661
I don't know why they picked it.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.080
I didn't ask them to pick it.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.790
I don't even read

04:48.122 --> 04:49.790
"The New York Times."

04:49.831 --> 04:50.916
You don't read--

04:50.958 --> 04:52.333
Well, Glenn, it's great

04:52.375 --> 04:54.086
and we're all just

04:52.375 --> 04:54.086
really happy for you.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.129
Whatever.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.838
[cellphone ringing]

04:56.880 --> 05:00.926
Oh, man,

04:56.880 --> 05:00.926
it's RW Apple again.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.262
God, does he have

05:00.968 --> 05:03.262
anyone else to talk to?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.930
What?

05:04.972 --> 05:08.433
It's like "Being There."

05:04.972 --> 05:08.433
He's Chauncey Gardiner.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.185
Hey Doyle, you have

05:08.475 --> 05:10.185
to look at it this way.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.271
You edited that piece, and if

05:10.227 --> 05:12.271
it hadn't been edited well

05:12.312 --> 05:13.897
"The Times" never

05:12.312 --> 05:13.897
would have picked it.

05:13.939 --> 05:17.192
Oh. That's a great way

05:13.939 --> 05:17.192
to look at it. Thank you.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.987
That it's because of me that

05:17.234 --> 05:19.987
he's gonna be Bob Woodward.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.489
I made it happen.

05:22.530 --> 05:23.531
So someday when I'm running

05:22.530 --> 05:23.531
the circulation department

05:23.573 --> 05:24.950
at the Muncie messenger

05:24.992 --> 05:26.994
and Glenn is accepting

05:24.992 --> 05:26.994
his Pulitzer Prize

05:27.035 --> 05:29.288
'I can point up

05:27.035 --> 05:29.288
at the screen at the local bar'

05:29.329 --> 05:31.999
where I regularly stop on my way

05:29.329 --> 05:31.999
home to get drop dead drunk

05:32.040 --> 05:34.459
and say,

05:32.040 --> 05:34.459
"I helped him get there."

05:34.501 --> 05:36.044
Then I can fall off

05:34.501 --> 05:36.044
the stool and throw up.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.629
Thank you so much

05:36.086 --> 05:37.629
for that, Gilmore.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.173
I never would have thought

05:37.671 --> 05:39.173
to look at it that way

05:39.214 --> 05:41.675
if it hadn't have been for you.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.635
[sighs]

05:43.677 --> 05:46.013
[instrumental music]

05:53.854 --> 05:56.606
[cellphone ringing]

05:58.108 --> 05:59.693
- Hey, mom.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.693
- So, how are you?

05:59.734 --> 06:01.653
- Do you want to laugh?

05:59.734 --> 06:01.653
- Laughing would be good.

06:01.695 --> 06:05.073
Luke did the funniest bit

06:01.695 --> 06:05.073
before. I thought you would--

06:05.115 --> 06:07.242
Will you stop?

06:05.115 --> 06:07.242
I did not do a bit.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.077
What are you talking about?

06:07.284 --> 06:09.077
The bit, it was a riot.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.954
(Luke)

06:09.119 --> 06:10.954
'It wasn't a bit.'

06:10.996 --> 06:12.497
'I banged my head on the stove

06:10.996 --> 06:12.497
and it hurt like hell.'

06:12.539 --> 06:14.916
No, no, you said it

06:12.539 --> 06:14.916
funnier before. Do it again.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.043
I told you I never

06:14.958 --> 06:16.043
did it in the first place.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.794
You did it. It's your bit.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.296
How could it be my bit when

06:17.836 --> 06:19.296
it's your head in the oven?

06:19.338 --> 06:22.007
Exactly. My head,

06:19.338 --> 06:22.007
my conk, no bit.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.425
Mom, just wondering, did you

06:22.049 --> 06:24.425
call for any particular reason?

06:24.467 --> 06:26.011
Just checking in. Seeing how're

06:24.467 --> 06:26.011
you doing? How're you doing?

06:26.053 --> 06:28.513
- I'm fine.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.513
- 'Uh...what's wrong?'

06:28.555 --> 06:30.140
What makes you think

06:28.555 --> 06:30.140
something's wrong?

06:30.182 --> 06:32.142
- You got Bambi voice.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.142
- I do not have Bambi voice.

06:32.184 --> 06:35.187
- Spill, please.

06:32.184 --> 06:35.187
- I'm just, I'm really behind.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.314
- 'Behind what?'

06:35.229 --> 06:37.314
- I'm behind at the paper.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.191
Way, way behind at the paper.

06:39.233 --> 06:42.485
Everyone else had these

06:39.233 --> 06:42.485
amazingly productive summers

06:42.527 --> 06:44.321
internships at hometown papers

06:44.363 --> 06:46.823
getting articles reprinted

06:44.363 --> 06:46.823
in "The New York Times."

06:46.865 --> 06:48.575
And me, the person

06:46.865 --> 06:48.575
who's been talking about

06:48.616 --> 06:50.827
being a journalist

06:48.616 --> 06:50.827
her entire life, what did I do?

06:50.869 --> 06:52.162
I wasted two whole months

06:52.204 --> 06:53.663
running away to Europe

06:52.204 --> 06:53.663
with grandma.

06:53.705 --> 06:57.042
Whoa. Slow down.

06:53.705 --> 06:57.042
First of all, Europe, waste?

06:57.084 --> 06:59.502
You had major invaluable

06:57.084 --> 06:59.502
experiences the architecture

06:59.544 --> 07:00.837
the food, seeing my mother

07:00.879 --> 07:02.214
without her makeup

07:00.879 --> 07:02.214
on in the morning.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.798
But this is the time

07:02.256 --> 07:03.798
for work, for learning.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.176
I didn't even consider

07:03.840 --> 07:06.176
an internship anywhere.

07:06.218 --> 07:09.930
I was so wrapped up

07:06.218 --> 07:09.930
in my own personal whatever.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.472
- I can't believe I did this.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.472
- 'Well, okay.'

07:11.514 --> 07:14.017
Let's take a step back here.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.017
You say you're behind.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.228
- I am behind.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.228
- So, you'll catch up.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.645
You say that like it's easy.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.773
No, I say that like it's

07:17.687 --> 07:19.773
what you're going to do.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.149
You've done it before.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.567
You were behind

07:21.191 --> 07:22.567
at Chilton, remember?

07:22.609 --> 07:24.652
And then you hit a deer,

07:22.609 --> 07:24.652
and everything was fine.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.363
The two incidents were

07:24.694 --> 07:26.363
in no way connected.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.323
- But you caught up, right?

07:26.405 --> 07:28.323
- That was high school.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.867
This is college,

07:28.365 --> 07:30.867
a very big, important college.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.536
Well, okay.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.536
Different school, but same Rory.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.038
You're great

07:33.578 --> 07:35.038
at the catch-up thing.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.041
You're the catch-up girl,

07:35.080 --> 07:38.041
not to be confused

07:38.083 --> 07:39.542
with ketchup girl,

07:38.083 --> 07:39.542
because that's not you at all.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.753
You were strictly

07:39.584 --> 07:41.753
a mustard-and-relish girl.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.005
There's a little

07:41.795 --> 07:44.005
condiment humor for you.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.633
I'm really gonna

07:44.047 --> 07:46.633
have to work, constantly.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.927
Maybe I'll look for something

07:46.674 --> 07:48.927
part time at a local paper.

07:48.969 --> 07:52.097
Good. That's good. Or you

07:48.969 --> 07:52.097
could work for a fishmonger.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.807
'Cause there's lots

07:52.139 --> 07:53.807
of newspapers there.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.683
Ow! Jeez! What the..

07:55.725 --> 07:56.851
[grunting]

07:56.893 --> 07:58.812
[laughing]

07:56.893 --> 07:58.812
He did it.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.522
He did the bit.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.522
Luke, do it again.

08:01.564 --> 08:02.732
Do it louder for Rory.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.234
- Hey, mom.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.234
- 'Yeah?'

08:04.276 --> 08:06.653
- You sound happy.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.653
- I am, kid.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.822
[panting]

08:09.781 --> 08:10.991
What?

08:11.032 --> 08:12.742
Mr. Mailer, it's just

08:11.032 --> 08:12.742
such a great honor

08:12.784 --> 08:14.411
to be doing this interview.

08:14.453 --> 08:15.912
- First I wanna thank you--

08:14.453 --> 08:15.912
- Can I give you a tip?

08:15.954 --> 08:17.580
Yes, sir.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.249
I wouldn't start that way

08:17.622 --> 08:19.249
for a simple reason.

08:19.291 --> 08:20.959
I don't trust compliments.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.585
I've been getting them

08:21.001 --> 08:22.585
for years.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.296
Sometimes I deserved them,

08:22.627 --> 08:24.296
and sometimes I didn't.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.006
But generally when people

08:24.338 --> 08:26.006
give you a compliment

08:26.047 --> 08:28.925
there's one or two things

08:26.047 --> 08:28.925
wrong with them.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.011
Either they are false

08:31.052 --> 08:33.180
or what's worse

08:31.052 --> 08:33.180
is they're sincere.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.806
They really mean the compliment.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.558
And then they're offering

08:34.848 --> 08:37.558
you their loyalty.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.811
And I'm kind of a stingy,

08:37.600 --> 08:39.811
cold fella.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.646
And I don't wanna start

08:39.853 --> 08:41.646
to give all that loyalty back.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.106
[laughing]

08:43.148 --> 08:44.565
So either way,

08:43.148 --> 08:44.565
let's skip the compliments.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.861
Let's talk about, uh,

08:44.607 --> 08:47.861
what are you working on now?

08:47.902 --> 08:49.321
I'm gonna keep saying no to you.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.738
I can't tell you

08:49.363 --> 08:50.738
what I'm working on.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.282
I never tell anybody

08:50.780 --> 08:52.282
what I'm working on.

08:52.324 --> 08:54.701
A novel is like a secret affair

08:54.742 --> 08:57.371
and you don't bring

08:54.742 --> 08:57.371
other people in on it.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.664
Norman Mailer's back

08:57.412 --> 08:59.664
for the third time this week.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.166
Yep. Sure is.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.584
This is so exciting.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.584
I've got to call and tell Rory.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.003
You know she read

09:03.626 --> 09:05.003
"The Naked And The Dead"

09:05.045 --> 09:06.713
while she was still

09:05.045 --> 09:06.713
wearing footsie pajamas.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.465
Chicken's burning.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.967
This is our first step

09:08.507 --> 09:10.967
on the road to being saloned.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.427
I mean as soon as word gets out

09:12.469 --> 09:14.762
that Norman Mailer is having

09:12.469 --> 09:14.762
lunch at the Dragonfly

09:14.804 --> 09:16.348
it's just a matter of time

09:16.390 --> 09:18.308
before the rest of

09:16.390 --> 09:18.308
the literati come sweeping in.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.060
So, of course,

09:18.350 --> 09:20.060
we'll have to keep Gore Vidal

09:20.101 --> 09:21.561
on the other side of the room.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.646
But you know, probably

09:21.602 --> 09:23.646
Gabriel Garcia Marquez

09:23.688 --> 09:25.023
will run interference for us.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.567
Butter bath, boys!

09:25.065 --> 09:27.567
Butter bath!

09:27.608 --> 09:28.902
- Everything okay?

09:27.608 --> 09:28.902
- Sure.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.278
I mean, I'm thrilled

09:28.943 --> 09:30.278
and delighted

09:30.320 --> 09:32.155
that Norman Mailer

09:30.320 --> 09:32.155
is coming in here every day

09:32.197 --> 09:33.614
and sitting at a table for four

09:33.656 --> 09:35.783
and ordering nothing

09:33.656 --> 09:35.783
at all but tea!

09:35.825 --> 09:37.077
- Tea?

09:35.825 --> 09:37.077
- Ice tea.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.870
Glass after glass after glass.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.288
I'm sure he orders

09:38.912 --> 09:40.288
more than ice tea.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.748
- Are you, now?

09:40.330 --> 09:41.748
- Alright.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.666
You make great ice tea.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.666
I mean legendary.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.502
So can you blame him?

09:45.544 --> 09:47.795
All I know is when Billy Joel

09:45.544 --> 09:47.795
came into the Independence Inn

09:47.837 --> 09:49.172
he would pack it away

09:49.214 --> 09:52.592
appetizers, main course,

09:49.214 --> 09:52.592
two, three desserts.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.094
That was a man

09:52.633 --> 09:54.094
that knew how to eat.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.678
And he was almost

09:54.135 --> 09:55.678
able to hide it.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.180
Yes, but have you

09:55.720 --> 09:57.180
ever read his novels?

09:57.222 --> 09:59.140
This is a restaurant,

09:57.222 --> 09:59.140
not a coffee shop.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.142
Come on, Sookie. This is fun.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.895
We're the cool place where

10:01.184 --> 10:03.895
Norman Mailer likes to hang.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.772
It'll give us

10:03.937 --> 10:05.772
street cred, you'll see.

10:05.813 --> 10:09.109
- Fine.

10:05.813 --> 10:09.109
- Need some more ice tea.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.319
Gee, I wonder

10:09.150 --> 10:11.319
who that's for.

10:11.361 --> 10:14.906
Lina, economic development.

10:11.361 --> 10:14.906
Sang, Woodbridge Hall.

10:14.948 --> 10:18.243
Benji, legal issues.

10:14.948 --> 10:18.243
Paris, religion beat.

10:18.285 --> 10:22.372
Me? Really?

10:18.285 --> 10:22.372
Huh. I hadn't thought.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.583
Alright.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.043
Jerry, city arts.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.043
Rory, features.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.836
- 'Glenn, crime.'

10:27.085 --> 10:28.836
- Hm.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.422
- What, you don't want crime?

10:28.878 --> 10:30.422
- I don't care.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.132
Maureen Dowd told me

10:30.464 --> 10:32.132
it's all the same

10:32.173 --> 10:35.093
not that that big flirt has any

10:32.173 --> 10:35.093
idea what she's talking about.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.595
Alright. That's it.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.388
Congratulations

10:36.636 --> 10:38.388
if you got want you wanted.

10:38.430 --> 10:41.891
And if you didn't,

10:38.430 --> 10:41.891
I could care less. Get cracking.

10:41.933 --> 10:44.060
Doyle, thank you so much

10:41.933 --> 10:44.060
for the features beat.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.479
I can't tell you

10:44.102 --> 10:45.479
how excited I am.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.854
Then please don't try.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.065
No, I'm gonna kick butt.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.065
You just wait and see.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.151
You're a reporter now, Gilmore.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.151
You gotta learn to say ass.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.902
I'll work on that.

10:52.944 --> 10:55.655
Hey, listen, um, I have about a

10:52.944 --> 10:55.655
million ideas for my first story

10:55.696 --> 10:57.198
so I was wondering if I could

10:55.696 --> 10:57.198
run some of them by you

10:57.240 --> 10:58.241
see what you think.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.659
Two minutes. Go.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.120
Okay, well, first I

10:59.700 --> 11:02.120
thought I could do an update

11:02.162 --> 11:04.164
on unionizing

11:02.162 --> 11:04.164
the janitorial staff.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.124
You know,

11:04.205 --> 11:06.124
a classic power struggle

11:06.166 --> 11:07.917
haves versus the have-nots.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.420
Or, and I already have

11:07.959 --> 11:10.420
a headline for this one

11:10.462 --> 11:13.756
"Yale's Liberal Activist

11:10.462 --> 11:13.756
Network-a thing of the past?"

11:13.798 --> 11:15.425
Catchy. Catchy.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.636
Then there's the issue of

11:15.467 --> 11:17.636
illegal music downloading

11:17.676 --> 11:19.471
on campus which

11:17.676 --> 11:19.471
I imagine is a major--

11:19.513 --> 11:21.389
- Oh, no.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.389
- What?

11:22.765 --> 11:23.975
He's back.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.561
- Bye.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.980
Well, Doyle, my friend.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.857
You're looking very very well.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.857
How you been?

11:30.898 --> 11:33.818
I've been great, Logan.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.818
It's great to have you back.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.445
Yeah, well, I stayed

11:33.860 --> 11:35.445
away as long as I could

11:35.487 --> 11:37.113
but the "Yale Daily News"

11:35.487 --> 11:37.113
it called to me, you know.

11:37.155 --> 11:40.033
Oh, sure. So, how's everything?

11:37.155 --> 11:40.033
How's the family?

11:40.074 --> 11:41.951
Everything's fine.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.951
A family's a family.

11:41.993 --> 11:44.078
Ah, my desk, beautiful.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.165
Um, you know, Logan,

11:44.120 --> 11:47.165
I actually didn't know exactly

11:47.207 --> 11:49.708
when you were coming back,

11:47.207 --> 11:49.708
and I gave out the beats.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.794
That's fine, Doyle. I'll take

11:49.750 --> 11:51.794
whatever one you got left over.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.880
Actually, there's none left.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.714
Perfect. Just the one I wanted.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.714
Relax, Doyle.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.050
I'm just here for the pretty

11:55.756 --> 11:57.050
picture of my father's head.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.801
I'm not gonna be

11:57.091 --> 11:58.801
any trouble at all.

11:58.843 --> 12:03.014
[chuckles]

11:58.843 --> 12:03.014
Oh, Logan, please.

11:58.843 --> 12:03.014
You, trouble? Stop.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.392
I'm just glad

12:03.056 --> 12:05.392
to have you here.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.435
Be careful, Doyle.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.435
You might hurt yourself.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.062
Better get back

12:07.477 --> 12:09.062
to work, right, boss?

12:09.103 --> 12:10.605
Rory, nice to see you.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.775
You know Logan?

12:13.233 --> 12:14.775
How do you know Logan?

12:14.817 --> 12:16.486
No, I don't know him. I met him.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.486
My friend introduced us.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.737
- So you're not friends?

12:16.528 --> 12:18.737
- No, definitely not friends.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.365
That guy's a real piece of work.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.782
He took last year off with

12:20.407 --> 12:21.782
a bunch of his friends.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.076
He was gonna sail daddy's yacht

12:23.117 --> 12:24.703
around the world

12:23.117 --> 12:24.703
until he sank it.

12:24.743 --> 12:26.413
- He sank his father's yacht?

12:24.743 --> 12:26.413
- Right off of Fiji.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.206
They spent six months

12:26.454 --> 12:28.206
gallivanting and partying

12:28.248 --> 12:29.874
and God knows what in there

12:29.916 --> 12:31.834
till daddy sent one of his

12:29.916 --> 12:31.834
planes to bring them back.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.127
I'm guessing his father's rich.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.504
His father's

12:33.169 --> 12:34.504
Mitchum Huntzberger.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.715
Mitchum Huntzberger.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.715
The newspaper guy?

12:36.755 --> 12:38.174
The newspaper magnet.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.593
The man owns at least

12:38.216 --> 12:39.593
12 different papers.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.636
I spent two years

12:39.634 --> 12:41.636
kissing Logan's butt.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.054
- Don't you mean ass?

12:41.678 --> 12:43.054
- 'Whatever.'

12:43.096 --> 12:45.181
I guess it's time

12:43.096 --> 12:45.181
to pucker up again.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.058
Man, I hate those kind of guys.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.228
- What kind of guys?

12:47.100 --> 12:50.228
- Those privileged white males.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.022
Doyle, you're

12:50.270 --> 12:53.022
a privileged white male.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.149
Well, he's more privileged

12:53.064 --> 12:55.149
and way more whiter.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.818
Why am I talking to you?

12:55.191 --> 12:57.818
Why am I talking to Gilmore?

12:57.860 --> 12:59.404
My story,

12:57.860 --> 12:59.404
we were picking a story.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.448
Right. Well, they

12:59.446 --> 13:01.448
all sound fine to me.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.032
Then I think I'll go

13:01.489 --> 13:03.032
with the downloading story.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.867
Good. Go with your gut.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.867
Now get to work.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.913
Hello. City desk.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.913
Smitty here. Take this down.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.164
I got a hot scoop

13:08.955 --> 13:10.164
on a tall blonde

13:10.206 --> 13:11.916
and I gotta put it

13:10.206 --> 13:11.916
to bed on the double.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.001
[clacking]

13:21.842 --> 13:25.012
Uh, how do you see your

13:21.842 --> 13:25.012
position in American letters?

13:25.054 --> 13:28.891
I'm either the best

13:25.054 --> 13:28.891
or I'm not, and I have no idea.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.645
And, in fact, I don't

13:28.933 --> 13:31.645
even worry about it anymore

13:31.686 --> 13:34.481
because it doesn't matter

13:31.686 --> 13:34.481
if you think you're the best.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.442
There are 20 of us around,

13:34.522 --> 13:37.442
20 American writers right now.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.110
I could name them, but I won't.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.028
Who think they're the best

13:39.152 --> 13:41.028
living American writer

13:41.070 --> 13:42.656
'and I'm one of those 20.'

13:42.697 --> 13:44.324
'On the other hand,

13:42.697 --> 13:44.324
I don't want to make friends'

13:44.365 --> 13:45.700
'with some of those guys,

13:44.365 --> 13:45.700
because they're bastards.'

13:45.742 --> 13:48.202
Okay, who is your favorite

13:45.742 --> 13:48.202
author of all time?

13:48.244 --> 13:51.706
- How are we doing over here?

13:48.244 --> 13:51.706
- We're fine. Thank you.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.875
Hey, you know what goes great

13:51.748 --> 13:54.875
with ice tea? Pork tenderloin.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.877
- Maybe later. Thanks.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.877
- 'We have a great menu here.'

13:56.919 --> 13:58.546
I'm holding a couple

13:56.919 --> 13:58.546
as we speak.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.299
- We're fine. Thank you.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.299
- Okay.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.092
Hey, I don't know

14:01.341 --> 14:03.092
if the waiter told you

14:03.134 --> 14:04.885
but today is Wednesday.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.263
And on Wednesday

14:04.927 --> 14:07.263
at the Dragonfly

14:07.305 --> 14:09.599
we play a little

14:07.305 --> 14:09.599
something I like to call

14:09.641 --> 14:12.226
Stump the chef, which is me.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.563
And the way we play is that

14:12.268 --> 14:15.563
you name any dish in the world

14:15.605 --> 14:16.606
and I will make it for you.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.566
And if I don't know what it is

14:18.608 --> 14:20.652
then you get your lunch

14:18.608 --> 14:20.652
completely free!

14:20.694 --> 14:22.529
What the devil

14:20.694 --> 14:22.529
is she talking about?

14:22.570 --> 14:24.947
Actually, could we have

14:22.570 --> 14:24.947
some lemon for the ice tea?

14:24.989 --> 14:27.617
Lemon. Oh, sure.

14:27.659 --> 14:30.537
One plate of lemon coming up.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.997
If you change your mind,

14:30.578 --> 14:32.997
I'll be in the kitchen.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.415
You know, with the food.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.670
I already have a ton of data

14:36.125 --> 14:38.670
and pages of research.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.589
Oh, and the best thing is Nancy,

14:38.712 --> 14:41.589
this girl on the 4th floor

14:41.631 --> 14:43.758
her father was the guy

14:41.631 --> 14:43.758
who ran security at the gallery

14:43.800 --> 14:45.593
when Lars Ulrich

14:43.800 --> 14:45.593
sold all his art

14:45.635 --> 14:47.094
and he said he'd try

14:45.635 --> 14:47.094
and get him on the phone

14:47.136 --> 14:48.763
for an interview,

14:47.136 --> 14:48.763
and I got to breathe now.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.765
- I think that was a record.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.765
- So what do you think?

14:50.807 --> 14:52.475
You think it sounds

14:50.807 --> 14:52.475
big enough, important enough?

14:52.517 --> 14:54.227
- Yes, I do.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.227
- I think so, too.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.229
I feel very very good

14:54.268 --> 14:56.229
about this, Forester.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.438
Excellent to hear, Gilmore.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.857
Monsignor, why is he asking you

14:58.898 --> 15:00.441
to keep your cell

14:58.898 --> 15:00.441
on vibrate during mass

15:00.483 --> 15:02.193
in case I need to

15:00.483 --> 15:02.193
fact check a quote outrageous?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.570
Rabbi Feldman's doing it

15:02.235 --> 15:03.570
for me on shabbas

15:03.611 --> 15:05.112
and he's flying

15:03.611 --> 15:05.112
against the Talmud there.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.448
So, when do I get to read

15:05.154 --> 15:07.448
this story of yours?

15:07.490 --> 15:08.867
Well, I think

15:07.490 --> 15:08.867
I'll finish a rough draft

15:08.908 --> 15:10.577
in time for our date

15:08.908 --> 15:10.577
tomorrow night.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.412
So you can have a romantic

15:10.618 --> 15:12.412
night of proofreading, huh?

15:12.453 --> 15:14.748
- 'Pretty hot, don't you think?'

15:12.453 --> 15:14.748
- Yeah, listen..

15:14.789 --> 15:15.998
'I'm kidding.

15:14.789 --> 15:15.998
You don't have to read it.'

15:16.040 --> 15:17.041
'I'll read it to you.'

15:17.083 --> 15:18.585
I-I have to work tomorrow night.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.336
- What?

15:18.626 --> 15:20.336
- 'I'm sorry.'

15:20.378 --> 15:22.296
But it's Thursday. Since when

15:20.378 --> 15:22.296
do you work on Thursdays?

15:22.338 --> 15:24.006
Since Taylor decided

15:22.338 --> 15:24.006
to try and cash in

15:24.048 --> 15:25.842
on the 24-hour trucker crowd.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.218
What trucker crowd?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.220
The trucker crowd

15:27.260 --> 15:29.220
off Highway 84.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.389
Since when does the trucker

15:29.262 --> 15:31.389
crowd off of Highway 84

15:31.431 --> 15:32.682
'come through Star's Hollow?'

15:32.724 --> 15:34.392
Since we installed

15:32.724 --> 15:34.392
an icy machine.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.852
- 'Wow.'

15:34.434 --> 15:35.852
- Yep.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.228
I'm stuck here

15:35.894 --> 15:37.228
pulling the new shifts

15:37.270 --> 15:38.271
until we see

15:37.270 --> 15:38.271
how it's catching on.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.980
- Sounds rough.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.980
- Yeah.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.065
You haven't lived

15:40.022 --> 15:41.065
until you've heard Taylor

15:41.107 --> 15:42.817
belt out "Stand by Your Man."

15:42.859 --> 15:44.903
- You deserve hazard pay.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.903
- Already submitted for it.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.655
So, no tomorrow night.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.655
Bummer. How about Saturday?

15:47.697 --> 15:49.908
Saturday, I'm here.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.908
What about next week?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.576
I've got Tuesday

15:49.949 --> 15:51.576
and Wednesdays off.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.829
I have this article, I'm behind

15:51.618 --> 15:54.829
on my reading. Next weekend?

15:54.871 --> 15:56.915
Going to Maine for my

15:54.871 --> 15:56.915
grandparents anniversary.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.667
- It was nice knowing you.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.667
- Way to stand by your man.

15:59.709 --> 16:00.960
So I guess it's week

15:59.709 --> 16:00.960
after next, huh?

16:01.001 --> 16:02.295
'Yeah, I guess so.'

16:02.336 --> 16:03.421
I turn in my article

16:02.336 --> 16:03.421
on that Monday.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.923
Monday night it is.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.633
They say absence makes

16:04.964 --> 16:06.633
the heart grow fonder.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.427
- Yeah, sex can do that also.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.427
- Amen, brother.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.053
'Okay, I gotta go.'

16:11.095 --> 16:12.639
You have to stir the nacho

16:11.095 --> 16:12.639
cheese every 20 minutes

16:12.680 --> 16:14.348
or it forms kind of a rock.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.267
- Go stir the cheese.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.267
- Call you tomorrow.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.478
Okay. Bye.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.814
Did you know that priests

16:18.519 --> 16:20.814
have a fabulous sense of humor?

16:20.855 --> 16:22.440
Just stay one lightning

16:20.855 --> 16:22.440
bolt's length away from me

16:22.482 --> 16:23.983
at all times, please.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.777
You wanna go check out

16:24.024 --> 16:25.777
some Mormon Bingo around 5th?

16:25.819 --> 16:27.278
- No, thanks.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.278
- How's your article coming?

16:27.320 --> 16:28.738
- Very good.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.738
- Good.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.114
So, you must have found

16:28.780 --> 16:30.114
a new angle on it, right?

16:30.156 --> 16:31.407
- Right. New angle.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.407
- Yeah, you know.

16:31.449 --> 16:32.784
Downloading stories

16:31.449 --> 16:32.784
are everywhere

16:32.826 --> 16:34.452
and they all say

16:32.826 --> 16:34.452
exactly the same thing.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.746
"Downloading's up, CD sales

16:34.494 --> 16:36.746
are down but up from last year.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.164
'"It's not hurting

16:36.788 --> 16:38.164
the music industry"'

16:38.205 --> 16:39.206
'"but the music industry

16:38.205 --> 16:39.206
is hurting."

16:39.248 --> 16:40.834
'Blah blah blah. You know.'

16:40.875 --> 16:42.794
It always seems like there's got

16:40.875 --> 16:42.794
to be more to it than that

16:42.836 --> 16:43.962
but there never is.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.839
But you have

16:44.003 --> 16:45.839
a fresh angle, so good.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.966
- Yeah, good.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.966
- 'Okay. I'll be back late.'

16:48.007 --> 16:49.884
If Rabbi Feldman calls

16:48.007 --> 16:49.884
tell him I got the stats

16:49.926 --> 16:51.344
from Edward James Olmos' office.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.596
- So I'm good. Bye.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.596
- Yeah, bye.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.434
Never mind. I see the noted

16:56.265 --> 16:58.434
pink. Thank you, Lorelai.

16:58.476 --> 16:59.853
- You're welcome.

16:58.476 --> 16:59.853
- Okay.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.604
I see a lot

16:59.894 --> 17:01.604
of growth this month.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.105
The initial drop-off, which

17:01.646 --> 17:03.105
we all knew was gonna happen

17:03.147 --> 17:04.816
after the opening

17:03.147 --> 17:04.816
has sorta settled

17:04.858 --> 17:07.944
and you're doing a good 70-75%

17:04.858 --> 17:07.944
occupancy, which is pretty good.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.445
Yeah, and the holidays

17:07.986 --> 17:09.445
are coming up.

17:09.487 --> 17:10.822
We're booked solid the last

17:09.487 --> 17:10.822
three weeks of November.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.490
Well, that's all

17:10.864 --> 17:12.490
positive news.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.951
So, let's talk about the things

17:12.532 --> 17:14.951
we can do to help till then.

17:14.993 --> 17:17.286
- So, we need help?

17:14.993 --> 17:17.286
- 'Well, yeah, some.'

17:17.328 --> 17:18.913
It's the first year, and you're

17:17.328 --> 17:18.913
gonna be building the business

17:18.955 --> 17:20.665
so there's not a lot

17:18.955 --> 17:20.665
of profit right now.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.082
And personally I'd feel better

17:22.124 --> 17:24.043
if we could lighten

17:22.124 --> 17:24.043
the financial load.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.461
- Financial loads?

17:24.084 --> 17:25.461
- That sounds bad.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.881
I could put in

17:25.503 --> 17:27.881
for overtime, and I don't.

17:27.922 --> 17:30.675
You need to get some burdens

17:27.922 --> 17:30.675
off of you, for example, lunch.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.134
What about lunch?

17:32.176 --> 17:33.511
Well, breakfast seems

17:32.176 --> 17:33.511
to be breaking even

17:33.553 --> 17:35.388
and you're doing fine

17:33.553 --> 17:35.388
with dinner, but lunch..

17:35.429 --> 17:36.806
What about lunch, Ann?

17:36.848 --> 17:38.558
You're hemorrhaging

17:36.848 --> 17:38.558
money at lunch.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.685
You have a full staff for

17:38.599 --> 17:40.685
a basically empty dining room.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.729
I think it might be

17:40.727 --> 17:42.729
a good idea to drop lunch

17:42.770 --> 17:44.605
'until you get

17:42.770 --> 17:44.605
your occupancy rate up higher.'

17:44.647 --> 17:46.691
Drop lunch?

17:44.647 --> 17:46.691
Did she say, drop lunch?

17:46.733 --> 17:49.027
Just until we get our occupancy

17:46.733 --> 17:49.027
rates up a little higher.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.029
- A lot higher.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.029
- I don't understand.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.739
That's the only

17:51.070 --> 17:52.739
thing we can do?

17:52.780 --> 17:54.949
I mean, I just think

17:52.780 --> 17:54.949
it's extremely coincidental

17:54.991 --> 17:57.368
that the only thing

17:54.991 --> 17:57.368
we can do to save the inn

17:57.410 --> 17:58.578
'is to get rid of lunch.'

17:58.619 --> 17:59.746
I'm sure

17:58.619 --> 17:59.746
it's not the only thing.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.080
I mean lunch is my thing.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.623
Why do we have

18:01.121 --> 18:02.623
to get rid of my things?

18:02.665 --> 18:04.667
Why can't we get rid

18:02.665 --> 18:04.667
of one of Michel's things?

18:04.709 --> 18:07.921
What things? I stand behind

18:04.709 --> 18:07.921
a desk and answer a phone.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.839
What of mine can you

18:07.962 --> 18:09.839
possibly get rid of?

18:09.881 --> 18:13.133
The desk, put the phone on

18:09.881 --> 18:13.133
the wall and write on your shoe.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.301
'Cause he goes through

18:13.175 --> 18:14.301
a lot of paper.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.970
Okay, Ann, would you just..

18:16.012 --> 18:17.764
(Sookie)

18:16.012 --> 18:17.764
'It's not fair.'

18:17.805 --> 18:19.265
It's not fair that everybody

18:17.805 --> 18:19.265
else gets to keep their thing

18:19.306 --> 18:20.558
and I have to get

18:19.306 --> 18:20.558
rid of my lunch.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.893
Sookie, Ann's just

18:20.600 --> 18:21.893
trying to help.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.644
- Oh, Ann hates me.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.644
- No, I don't.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.312
Okay, Ann, how would you

18:23.686 --> 18:25.312
like to go in the kitchen

18:25.354 --> 18:26.522
and get yourself

18:25.354 --> 18:26.522
a cup of coffee?

18:26.564 --> 18:27.857
- I don't hate her.

18:26.564 --> 18:27.857
- I know.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.692
Michel, can you get

18:27.899 --> 18:29.692
Ann some coffee?

18:29.734 --> 18:33.237
Oh, absolutely. And then I'll

18:29.734 --> 18:33.237
go hang my phone on the wall.

18:33.279 --> 18:36.365
Oh, I have to tell you,

18:33.279 --> 18:36.365
looking good is so important

18:36.407 --> 18:38.076
when you represent

18:36.407 --> 18:38.076
the face of the company.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.327
I mean I am the first thing

18:38.117 --> 18:40.327
that a customer sees

18:40.369 --> 18:41.704
when they walk

18:40.369 --> 18:41.704
through that door.

18:41.746 --> 18:43.247
Your suits are not

18:41.746 --> 18:43.247
a deduction, Michel.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.666
- What are you doing?

18:43.289 --> 18:45.666
- She's taking my lunches away.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.877
- She's trying to help us.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.877
- It's Norman Mailer's fault.

18:47.919 --> 18:49.420
He just sits around

18:47.919 --> 18:49.420
ordering nothing

18:49.462 --> 18:51.338
and yammering on and on and on.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.507
So, he was married to

18:51.380 --> 18:53.507
Marilyn Monroe. Who wasn't?

18:53.549 --> 18:55.051
That was Arthur Miller.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.344
I'm gonna kick him

18:55.093 --> 18:57.344
and pinch his nose.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.014
Hey, get a grip. We're trying

18:57.386 --> 19:00.014
to launch a business here.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.850
The restaurant

19:00.056 --> 19:02.850
is part of the business.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.602
And-and cutting out

19:02.892 --> 19:04.602
lunch is not the--

19:04.644 --> 19:07.313
Temporarily cutting out

19:04.644 --> 19:07.313
lunch, temporarily, Sookie

19:07.354 --> 19:09.023
just until things perk up.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.023
Which they will.

19:09.065 --> 19:12.276
And when they do, the lunches

19:09.065 --> 19:12.276
will go back, just like before.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.654
- 'Sookie? Okay?'

19:12.318 --> 19:14.654
- Fine.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.656
- Just give it time.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.656
- Mm-hm.

19:16.697 --> 19:19.533
And we're going to leave

19:16.697 --> 19:19.533
Mr. Mailer alone, right?

19:19.575 --> 19:21.661
'Cause I don't care how old

19:19.575 --> 19:21.661
he is, he can take you.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.287
I know.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.290
So we're booted up,

19:24.789 --> 19:26.290
and we're searching

19:26.332 --> 19:28.001
the network for

19:26.332 --> 19:28.001
other clients, right?

19:28.042 --> 19:30.377
Then you enter the album you

19:28.042 --> 19:30.377
want in the search field, right?

19:30.419 --> 19:31.629
Let's say it's the new Interpol.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.047
- You heard it?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.047
- I think so.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.757
A little less

19:33.089 --> 19:34.757
joy Division-y this time

19:34.799 --> 19:36.550
more Nick Cave

19:34.799 --> 19:36.550
got mugged by Paul Weller

19:36.592 --> 19:38.928
with some "Seventeen

19:36.592 --> 19:38.928
Seconds-era," cure, thrown in.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.304
But, anyway, for better quality

19:40.346 --> 19:42.140
you choose the file with

19:40.346 --> 19:42.140
the highest bit rate.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.600
It's a tradeoff

19:42.181 --> 19:44.600
'cause it's a bigger file size.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.310
The lower the bit rate,

19:44.642 --> 19:46.310
the smaller the file

19:46.352 --> 19:48.104
'but lower quality. Got that?'

19:48.146 --> 19:49.480
Higher, smaller.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.480
Lower, larger.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.482
Higher, larger.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.482
Lower, smaller.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.859
Oh! Check this out.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.735
I can download

19:52.900 --> 19:54.735
a band's entire catalog

19:54.777 --> 19:56.320
with the push of a button.

19:56.362 --> 19:59.490
I can take down all 22

19:56.362 --> 19:59.490
"Chicago" albums. Boo-ya!

19:59.532 --> 20:01.701
There's "Chicago one,"

19:59.532 --> 20:01.701
"Chicago two," "Chicago three"

20:01.742 --> 20:03.577
"Chicago four." Neat, huh?

20:03.619 --> 20:04.620
Yeah, really neat.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.664
"Chicago nine," "Chicago ten."

20:06.706 --> 20:09.709
I hate "Chicago."

20:06.706 --> 20:09.709
Use a trombone, go to jail.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.795
But my goal is to get

20:09.750 --> 20:12.795
it all from Abba to Zappa.

20:12.837 --> 20:15.173
There's the Christmas album.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.425
Okay, that's really fascinating

20:15.214 --> 20:18.425
stuff, but let me ask you..

20:18.467 --> 20:20.053
...do you still buy CDs?

20:20.094 --> 20:22.763
- Yeah.

20:20.094 --> 20:22.763
- Mm-hm.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.306
Anything to add to that?

20:24.348 --> 20:26.392
CD sales are up this year.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.392
You hear about that?

20:26.433 --> 20:27.894
- Yes, I did.

20:26.433 --> 20:27.894
- 'Down last year.'

20:27.935 --> 20:30.688
Up this year. Weird. Oh! Cool!

20:30.730 --> 20:32.272
Here's a 1986 bootleg

20:32.314 --> 20:34.441
of Chicago live at the

20:32.314 --> 20:34.441
Cumberland Civic Center

20:43.576 --> 20:45.870

20:45.912 --> 20:47.621
- I hate that.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.621

20:47.663 --> 20:49.207
I think I'm gonna

20:47.663 --> 20:49.207

20:49.248 --> 20:51.250
Coffee sounds good.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.250

22:03.864 --> 22:05.574
- Crying, screaming.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.554
She's not here. She's out again.

22:27.596 --> 22:28.931
- When is she getting home?

22:27.596 --> 22:28.931
- 'I don't know what to do.'

Huh. How long ago

22:55.457 --> 22:57.710

22:57.751 --> 22:59.920
she's hungry, but she won't eat.

Oh, crap. There she goes again.

but the minute I'm in trouble..

24:04.402 --> 24:05.986
Well, that's what

24:04.402 --> 24:05.986
we're here for.

24:06.028 --> 24:09.031
Yeah, I've been traveling so

24:06.028 --> 24:09.031
much, then I get home to this.

24:09.073 --> 24:10.616
And I-I didn't know what to do.

24:10.657 --> 24:13.619
I swear I didn't know

24:10.657 --> 24:13.619
what to do.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.204
Chris..

24:15.246 --> 24:17.623
- Yeah?

24:15.246 --> 24:17.623
- Where is Sherry?

24:17.664 --> 24:20.584
- Sherry is in Paris.

24:17.664 --> 24:20.584
- Wow. Lucky girl.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.502
When does she get back?

24:22.544 --> 24:24.671
She's not.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.215
She's..

24:28.175 --> 24:30.928
I got home from Seattle,

24:28.175 --> 24:30.928
and the nanny was here

24:30.970 --> 24:32.596
and she handed me a note.

24:32.638 --> 24:36.309
It said that Sherry

24:32.638 --> 24:36.309
had been offered a job in Paris

24:36.350 --> 24:38.644
'and she had decided

24:36.350 --> 24:38.644
to take it.'

24:38.685 --> 24:40.104
What?

24:40.146 --> 24:41.147
'She said she had put

24:40.146 --> 24:41.147
her career on hold'

24:41.188 --> 24:42.648
for almost two years.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.233
She said that I had

24:42.689 --> 24:44.233
been gone for most of that time

24:44.275 --> 24:45.734
which I guess is true

24:45.776 --> 24:47.945
and she wasn't gonna let

24:45.776 --> 24:47.945
this opportunity pass.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.322
'She said it was my turn.'

24:49.363 --> 24:53.159
She was sorry,

24:49.363 --> 24:53.159
but she had to do this for her.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.577
- Wow. I'm stunned.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.577
- Yeah.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.204
Pretty much my same reaction.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.539

24:57.246 --> 24:59.539

25:01.083 --> 25:04.502

25:04.544 --> 25:06.297

25:06.339 --> 25:08.215
Really? Well, I'm hot.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.344
Okay, um, how about

25:09.633 --> 25:11.344
this for a plan?

25:11.385 --> 25:12.970
You go take a shower

25:13.012 --> 25:15.889
and I will, um, order

25:13.012 --> 25:15.889
some food and start to clean up.

25:15.931 --> 25:18.434
Hey, I can't do this.

25:18.476 --> 25:20.644
Do what, shower?

25:18.476 --> 25:20.644
Oh, you've done it before.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.271
You just turn

25:20.686 --> 25:22.271
the water on and step in.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.357
Wait, remove clothes,

25:22.313 --> 25:24.357
then step in.

25:24.398 --> 25:25.483
I can't raise her.

25:25.523 --> 25:27.609
I cannot raise her

25:25.523 --> 25:27.609
all by myself.

25:27.651 --> 25:28.610
Yes, you can.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.112
What makes you think so?

25:30.154 --> 25:31.238
Because you have to.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.865
Chris, she's your daughter

25:32.906 --> 25:34.658
and you're going to find a way.

25:34.700 --> 25:35.993
I did. I did it with Rory.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.287
- You're different.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.287
- Yes. I was 16.

25:38.329 --> 25:40.080
Well, you're different.

25:38.329 --> 25:40.080
I mean, you're-you're special.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.748
You're stronger.

25:41.790 --> 25:44.877
You're like a superhero with

25:41.790 --> 25:44.877
red boots and a golden lasso.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.337
It was one Halloween,

25:44.918 --> 25:46.337
Christopher.

25:46.379 --> 25:48.088
I mean you raised Rory

25:46.379 --> 25:48.088
all by yourself.

25:48.130 --> 25:50.174
You had no one to help you,

25:48.130 --> 25:50.174
and you didn't look back.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.342
That's right.

25:51.384 --> 25:53.551
But if I had decided

25:51.384 --> 25:53.551
to bail on Rory

25:53.593 --> 25:55.679
and follow the bangles

25:53.593 --> 25:55.679
around the world

25:55.721 --> 25:57.764
which is what I planned to do

25:55.721 --> 25:57.764
until the Demerol kicked in

25:57.806 --> 26:00.309
then you would have put on

25:57.806 --> 26:00.309
the red boots and golden lasso.

26:00.351 --> 26:01.643
And you would have raised her

26:01.685 --> 26:05.189
and everything

26:01.685 --> 26:05.189
would have been fine.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.857
But she wouldn't have

26:05.231 --> 26:06.857
introduced you to anyone

26:06.899 --> 26:09.567
or let you go

times that people suck and--

27:24.977 --> 27:26.812
- Paris!

27:24.977 --> 27:26.812
- What?

27:26.853 --> 27:28.730
You have threatened, stalked,

27:26.853 --> 27:28.730
and basically freaked out

27:28.772 --> 27:30.983
every religious leader

27:28.772 --> 27:30.983
within a 100-mile radius.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.110
This paper has never

27:31.024 --> 27:33.110
received so many complaints

27:33.152 --> 27:34.528
in the history of its existence.

27:34.570 --> 27:35.904
And how the hell did you get

27:35.946 --> 27:37.364
Jesse Jackson's

27:35.946 --> 27:37.364
barber's number? How?

27:37.406 --> 27:39.325
Hey, you gave me

27:37.406 --> 27:39.325
this beat to find a story

27:39.366 --> 27:41.201
not to kowtow and make nice--

27:41.243 --> 27:42.244
- Geller!

27:41.243 --> 27:42.244
- What?

27:42.286 --> 27:44.371
- Way to go.

27:42.286 --> 27:44.371
- Thanks.

27:44.413 --> 27:45.956
Don't you dare give

27:44.413 --> 27:45.956
back those flip-flops.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.833
Not a chance.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.833
They fit perfectly.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.209
Hey, Doyle, I think

27:47.874 --> 27:49.209
I want to change my story.

27:49.251 --> 27:50.877
- Yeah?

27:49.251 --> 27:50.877
- Yeah.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.045
The downloading story was a dead

27:50.919 --> 27:52.045
end. There's nothing there.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.089
- You're telling me.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.089
- What?

27:54.131 --> 27:55.799
I got bored

27:54.131 --> 27:55.799
just hearing you pitch it.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.843
So, what do you got now?

27:57.884 --> 28:00.262
Okay, well, last night

28:00.304 --> 28:01.847
I was in one of the bathrooms

28:00.304 --> 28:01.847
over at Berkeley

28:01.888 --> 28:04.057
and this girl came in,

28:01.888 --> 28:04.057
slightly toasted.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.143
She was wearing

28:04.099 --> 28:06.143
a full-on ball gown

28:06.185 --> 28:07.769
with one of those

28:06.185 --> 28:07.769
plastic gorilla masks.

28:07.811 --> 28:08.854
Not something you see every day.

28:08.895 --> 28:10.356
'Exactly what I thought.'

28:10.397 --> 28:11.731
So I followed her out

28:10.397 --> 28:11.731
to the parking lot

28:11.773 --> 28:14.193
and she got in

28:11.773 --> 28:14.193
this fancy, black SUV

28:14.234 --> 28:16.069
and said the phrase

28:14.234 --> 28:16.069
<i>In Omnia Paratus</i>

28:16.111 --> 28:17.737
which means

28:16.111 --> 28:17.737
ready for anything.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.906
- I know. I took Latin.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.906
- Quel impressed. Continue.

28:19.948 --> 28:23.160
All this seemed a little weird,

28:19.948 --> 28:23.160
but interesting weird, you know?

28:23.202 --> 28:25.996
So, I don't know,

28:23.202 --> 28:25.996
maybe it's all this hanging out

28:26.038 --> 28:27.789
with a real newspaperman

28:26.038 --> 28:27.789
like yourself

28:27.831 --> 28:29.082
'but my antenna went up.'

28:29.124 --> 28:30.501
'I felt there

28:29.124 --> 28:30.501
was a story there.'

28:30.543 --> 28:32.127
Did you catch

28:30.543 --> 28:32.127
the subtle sucking up?

28:32.169 --> 28:33.837
- Caught it. Continue.

28:32.169 --> 28:33.837
- So, I googled the phrase.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.589
Not quite sure

28:33.879 --> 28:35.589
what I was looking for

28:35.631 --> 28:37.799
but then I found this.

28:37.841 --> 28:40.135
See, it links the phrase

28:37.841 --> 28:40.135
with a club here at Yale.

28:40.177 --> 28:43.180
It's sort of a secret society,

28:40.177 --> 28:43.180
kind of skull and bones

28:43.222 --> 28:45.891
kind of creepy group

28:43.222 --> 28:45.891
dating back to the 1800s.

28:45.932 --> 28:47.267
This phrase was their motto.

28:47.309 --> 28:49.811
Now, that alone,

28:47.309 --> 28:49.811
not that interesting.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.813
But here. Look.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.193
Huh.

28:56.235 --> 29:00.072
I found this in a 1996 edition

28:56.235 --> 29:00.072
of the "Yale Daily News."

29:00.113 --> 29:02.449
It's an article on whether or

29:00.113 --> 29:02.449
not this club actually exists.

29:02.491 --> 29:05.452
A life-and-death brigade.

29:02.491 --> 29:05.452
Yeah, I know these guys.

29:05.494 --> 29:07.496
- Oh, you do?

29:05.494 --> 29:07.496
- Well, I've heard of them.

29:07.538 --> 29:08.706
They're apparently

29:07.538 --> 29:08.706
even more elusive

29:08.747 --> 29:10.123
than the skull-and-bones crowd.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.166
Of course, they've never

29:10.165 --> 29:11.166
been linked

29:11.208 --> 29:12.626
to masturbating in a coffin

29:12.668 --> 29:14.127
so I automatically

29:12.668 --> 29:14.127
like these guys better.

29:14.169 --> 29:15.837
Mm. What do you know about them?

29:15.879 --> 29:17.839
Not much. The paper's tried

29:15.879 --> 29:17.839
to track them down before.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.966
We've gotten a few leads

29:17.881 --> 29:19.966
but no one's ever gotten close

29:20.008 --> 29:21.093
enough to confirm anything.

29:21.134 --> 29:22.135
We all know they exist

29:22.177 --> 29:23.887
but we don't know they exist.

29:23.929 --> 29:27.891
It's all just too, too..

29:23.929 --> 29:27.891
God, I hate those stupid clubs.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.602
I wanna do this story.

29:29.643 --> 29:32.104
I wanna find this club, track

29:29.643 --> 29:32.104
them down, get on the inside.

29:32.145 --> 29:35.190
- What do you think?

29:32.145 --> 29:35.190
- Go with your gut.

29:35.232 --> 29:37.443
You said that

29:35.232 --> 29:37.443
about my downloading story.

29:37.484 --> 29:39.319
Hey, you don't trust my gut.

29:39.361 --> 29:41.530
[instrumental music]

29:42.615 --> 29:43.782
Finally.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.659
What are you doing out here?

29:45.701 --> 29:49.371
Am I wearing the same thing

29:45.701 --> 29:49.371
I wore last Friday night?

29:49.413 --> 29:51.331
Halfway here, I was struck

29:49.413 --> 29:51.331
my the overwhelming feeling

29:51.373 --> 29:54.209
that I wore this exact outfit

29:51.373 --> 29:54.209
to dinner last Friday night.

29:54.251 --> 29:56.002
There's no way

29:54.251 --> 29:56.002
I'm going in there

29:56.044 --> 29:58.338
to see my mother wearing the

29:56.044 --> 29:58.338
same thing I wore last Friday.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.382
Because I may not remember,

29:58.380 --> 30:00.382
but she sure as hell will.

30:00.424 --> 30:01.967
- I don't know.

30:00.424 --> 30:01.967
- You don't know?

30:02.008 --> 30:03.594
You don't remember,

30:02.008 --> 30:03.594
but you expect me to?

30:03.636 --> 30:05.178
You look at me

30:03.636 --> 30:05.178
more than I look at me.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.555
You sit across

30:05.220 --> 30:06.555
from me at dinner.

30:06.597 --> 30:07.931
You had more

30:06.597 --> 30:07.931
of a chance to imprint

30:07.973 --> 30:09.433
my ensemble in your brain.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.393
- Sorry. No imprint.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.393
- Oh, that hurts.

30:11.435 --> 30:13.019
Well, I'm sure you don't

30:11.435 --> 30:13.019
remember what I was wearing.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.062
I most certainly do.

30:14.104 --> 30:15.397
Okay, what was I wearing?

30:15.439 --> 30:17.190
You were wearing a lovely

30:17.232 --> 30:20.277
and delicately

30:17.232 --> 30:20.277
understated outfit.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.528
Well, you were definitely

30:20.319 --> 30:21.528
wearing these arms.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.489
Oh, way to imprint, lady.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.949
Stand in front of me

30:23.530 --> 30:25.949
just in case.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.242
Hello.

30:27.284 --> 30:28.994
Hi, we should be

30:27.284 --> 30:28.994
on the guest list.

30:29.035 --> 30:31.747
Halston and Liza

30:29.035 --> 30:31.747
are expecting us.

30:31.789 --> 30:32.790
Okay, let's try it straight.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.416
Hi, we're here for dinner.

30:34.458 --> 30:36.376
I'm Lorelai, the daughter.

30:34.458 --> 30:36.376
This is Rory, the granddaughter.

30:36.418 --> 30:38.712
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

30:36.418 --> 30:38.712
Right this way.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.715
She's acting weird.

30:41.757 --> 30:43.258
She knows I'm wearing

30:41.757 --> 30:43.258
the same outfit as last week.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.593
She wasn't here last week.

30:44.635 --> 30:46.261
Hey, the world's small.

30:44.635 --> 30:46.261
Maids talk.

30:46.303 --> 30:47.638
- About you?

30:46.303 --> 30:47.638
- Yes.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.055
With all that's going

30:47.680 --> 30:49.055
on in the world

30:49.097 --> 30:51.433
all the maids in existence

30:49.097 --> 30:51.433
are talking about you.

30:51.475 --> 30:53.477
Okay, now you're making me seem

30:51.475 --> 30:53.477
a little stuck-up.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.728
Can I get you

30:53.519 --> 30:54.728
something to drink?

30:54.770 --> 30:56.689
- Yes, Martini, please.

30:54.770 --> 30:56.689
- Coke, please.

30:56.730 --> 30:58.440
Oh, you know, maybe

30:56.730 --> 30:58.440
we should wait for my mother.

30:58.482 --> 31:00.025
- Is she coming down soon?

30:58.482 --> 31:00.025
- No.

31:00.066 --> 31:01.901
Oh. Okay.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.945
Do you know if she saw what I

31:01.943 --> 31:03.945
was wearing through the window?

31:03.987 --> 31:05.197
Mrs. Gilmore isn't here.

31:05.238 --> 31:06.906
- She's not?

31:05.238 --> 31:06.906
- Where is she?

31:06.948 --> 31:08.659
She's at a dinner

31:06.948 --> 31:08.659
for the children's hospital.

31:08.701 --> 31:10.703
Oh, so she's not gonna

31:08.701 --> 31:10.703
be here at all tonight.

31:10.744 --> 31:12.162
- No, I'm afraid not.

31:10.744 --> 31:12.162
- Okay.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.080
Well, then I guess

31:12.204 --> 31:14.080
we can just..

31:14.122 --> 31:16.583
Yeah, we'll just go have dinner

31:14.122 --> 31:16.583
in the pool house with dad.

31:16.625 --> 31:17.668
- Oh..

31:16.625 --> 31:17.668
- Oh?

31:17.710 --> 31:19.127
Mr. Gilmore is out of town.

31:19.169 --> 31:21.963
- He is?

31:19.169 --> 31:21.963
- 'Till Tuesday.'

31:22.005 --> 31:23.716
We've officially

31:22.005 --> 31:23.716
become afterthoughts.

31:23.757 --> 31:25.425
Would you like me to make

31:23.757 --> 31:25.425
you two something for dinner?

31:25.467 --> 31:27.678
Um, well, since everyone's gone

31:27.720 --> 31:29.179
maybe I'll just head

31:27.720 --> 31:29.179
back to school.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.014
I have a lot of work

31:29.221 --> 31:31.014
to do at the paper.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.975
Yeah. Okay. That would be one

31:31.056 --> 31:33.975
option, going back to school.

31:34.017 --> 31:37.563
However another option would

31:34.017 --> 31:37.563
be staying here, ordering pizza

31:37.604 --> 31:39.732
and eating dinner on the living

31:37.604 --> 31:39.732
room floor on paper plates.

31:39.773 --> 31:41.316
You're evil.

31:41.358 --> 31:42.359
Would you bring us

31:41.358 --> 31:42.359
a phone book, please.

31:42.401 --> 31:43.902
Right away.

31:43.943 --> 31:46.905
- Get crazy.

31:43.943 --> 31:46.905
- Okay.

31:46.946 --> 31:48.699
Let's really live it up.

31:46.946 --> 31:48.699
Carpe diem, baby.

31:48.741 --> 31:49.908
I'm touching the rug

31:48.741 --> 31:49.908
with my feet.

31:49.949 --> 31:51.493
Ooh, you're perverse.

31:51.535 --> 31:53.912
Hey, and when she brings

31:51.535 --> 31:53.912
the drinks, let's not coasters.

31:53.953 --> 31:55.330
I wonder if there's

31:53.953 --> 31:55.330
anything in here

31:55.372 --> 31:57.207
that we could unalphabetize.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.877
The rug is so soft.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.877
Oh, you would not believe.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.628
Would gluing everything

31:59.918 --> 32:01.628
in this room to the ceiling

32:01.670 --> 32:03.963
so that it's in exactly

32:01.670 --> 32:03.963
the same place but upside down

32:04.005 --> 32:05.131
be going too far?

32:05.173 --> 32:08.385
- A little.

32:05.173 --> 32:08.385
- So...dish?

32:08.427 --> 32:10.470
Absolutely.

32:10.512 --> 32:12.472
Sherry left your dad.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.224
What? When?

32:14.266 --> 32:15.434
A couple of days ago.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.060
She got a job offer in Paris

32:17.102 --> 32:19.730
and she packed her tiny

32:17.102 --> 32:19.730
pants in a bag and bailed.

32:19.772 --> 32:21.231
- What about Gigi?

32:19.772 --> 32:21.231
- Left her with Chris.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.816
- No way.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.816
- 'Yeah.'

32:22.858 --> 32:25.277
He came home, and the nanny

32:22.858 --> 32:25.277
handed him a letter.

32:25.318 --> 32:27.696
I can't believe this. How

32:25.318 --> 32:27.696
could she just leave like that?

32:27.738 --> 32:29.573
- I have no idea.

32:27.738 --> 32:29.573
- How do you know all this?

32:29.615 --> 32:30.949
- He called me.

32:29.615 --> 32:30.949
- When?

32:30.990 --> 32:32.826
Yesterday. He was freaking out.

32:32.868 --> 32:35.120
Because he couldn't stop Gigi

32:32.868 --> 32:35.120
from crawling out of her crib.

32:35.161 --> 32:37.372
And, you know, I do have

32:35.161 --> 32:37.372
to hand it to him.

32:37.414 --> 32:39.750
He gets extra points

32:37.414 --> 32:39.750
for the very original

32:39.792 --> 32:41.835
duct-taping-of-the-diaper move.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.837
-'The place was a wreck.'

32:41.877 --> 32:43.837
- You went over there?

32:43.879 --> 32:45.881
Oh, yeah, I calmed him down

32:45.923 --> 32:47.716
and then, you know, we sort

32:45.923 --> 32:47.716
of got the place in order.

32:47.758 --> 32:49.593
And I think

32:47.758 --> 32:49.593
everything's gonna be okay.

32:49.635 --> 32:50.844
I'm gonna go back on Monday

32:50.886 --> 32:53.096
and make sure everyone's

32:50.886 --> 32:53.096
still breathing.

32:53.138 --> 32:56.182
Oh well, that's

32:53.138 --> 32:56.182
very nice of you.

32:56.224 --> 32:59.770
Well, your dad is gonna need

32:56.224 --> 32:59.770
a little help, being a dad.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.855
I mean, 'cause..

33:01.897 --> 33:05.859
...well, he was your dad,

33:01.897 --> 33:05.859
so no news flash here.

33:05.901 --> 33:07.110
But you should see Gigi.

33:07.152 --> 33:11.197
She's huge and gorgeous

33:07.152 --> 33:11.197
and a belter.

33:12.783 --> 33:15.034
Oh, great. Dinner is served.

33:16.578 --> 33:19.372
♪ La la la la la ♪

33:21.792 --> 33:25.128
♪ Oh la la la la la ♪

33:27.088 --> 33:30.383

33:41.937 --> 33:45.064

33:48.568 --> 33:50.570
It's a beautiful

33:48.568 --> 33:50.570
one and a half mile hike.

33:50.612 --> 33:53.657
Um, there's a waterfall

33:50.612 --> 33:53.657
around this bend here.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.869
And over here are some of the

33:53.699 --> 33:56.869
oldest birch trees in the area.

33:56.910 --> 33:59.162
A rare butterfly nature preserve

33:56.910 --> 33:59.162
is off to the right here.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.789
[cellphone ringing]

34:00.831 --> 34:03.333
Oh, excuse me. Michel,

34:00.831 --> 34:03.333
would you take over for me?

34:03.375 --> 34:05.084
Oh, yes. Of course.

34:06.586 --> 34:10.215
Okay, so over here

34:06.586 --> 34:10.215
by this semi-polluted brook

34:10.256 --> 34:13.343
you will find find

34:10.256 --> 34:13.343
large, scary spiders

34:13.385 --> 34:16.221
and a fascinating

34:13.385 --> 34:16.221
display of poison ivy.

34:16.262 --> 34:18.557
Luke, slow down.

34:18.598 --> 34:19.975
I can't come now. I'm working.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.728
He what?

34:22.769 --> 34:25.814
[sighs]

34:22.769 --> 34:25.814
Okay. Fine. I'm on my way.

34:25.856 --> 34:27.315
Yes, I'm running.

34:27.357 --> 34:28.358
My feet are going

34:27.357 --> 34:28.358
like a cartoon character.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.735
There are dust clouds behind me

34:29.776 --> 34:31.653
and the background keeps

34:29.776 --> 34:31.653
repeating itself. Bye.

34:32.988 --> 34:35.407
Which brings you

34:32.988 --> 34:35.407
to the rattlesnake curve

34:35.448 --> 34:37.743
where people have

34:35.448 --> 34:37.743
actually died painful

34:37.784 --> 34:39.870
but very picturesque deaths.

34:39.912 --> 34:41.663
Lunch at the Dragonfly!

34:41.705 --> 34:43.999
Get your lunch

34:41.705 --> 34:43.999
at the Dragonfly!

34:44.041 --> 34:45.542
You have not eaten lunch

34:45.584 --> 34:47.711
till you've eaten lunch

34:45.584 --> 34:47.711
at the Dragonfly!

34:47.753 --> 34:49.295
I mean it, Kirk.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.295
Get away from here!

34:49.337 --> 34:52.632
I am on the sidewalk, Luke.

34:49.337 --> 34:52.632
You do not own the sidewalk.

34:52.674 --> 34:54.259
The sidewalk is

34:52.674 --> 34:54.259
for the common people

34:54.300 --> 34:56.302
the<i> hoi polloi,</i>

34:54.300 --> 34:56.302
the everyman.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.013
And every man and every woman

34:56.344 --> 34:58.013
would like to have

34:58.055 --> 34:59.556
a delicious lunch

34:58.055 --> 34:59.556
at the Dragonfly.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.182
I'm gonna call the cops.

35:01.224 --> 35:03.602
Cops get free pie with lunch

35:01.224 --> 35:03.602
at the Dragonfly!

35:03.643 --> 35:06.855
Ah, Kirk, what are you doing?

35:03.643 --> 35:06.855
You're a giant hot dog.

35:06.897 --> 35:08.189
Technically, I'm a giant wiener.

35:08.231 --> 35:09.691
The costume tag says "wiener."

35:09.733 --> 35:12.485
Get him away from my diner.

35:09.733 --> 35:12.485
I mean it.

35:12.527 --> 35:13.695
Don't you worry, Lorelai.

35:13.737 --> 35:14.738
I have no intention

35:14.780 --> 35:16.155
of abandoning my post

35:16.197 --> 35:17.449
and I will not rest

35:17.490 --> 35:19.242
till every person

35:17.490 --> 35:19.242
in Stars Hollow

35:19.284 --> 35:20.827
has tried lunch

35:19.284 --> 35:20.827
at the Dragonfly.

35:20.869 --> 35:22.412
Kirk, I don't

35:20.869 --> 35:22.412
understand this.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.372
I'm trying to scrounge up

35:22.454 --> 35:24.372
a lunch crowd for you.

35:24.414 --> 35:25.874
So, I figured I'd go

35:24.414 --> 35:25.874
where everybody

35:25.916 --> 35:27.584
already has lunch

35:25.916 --> 35:27.584
and get them over to you.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.753
And I'm doing a pretty good job,

35:27.626 --> 35:29.753
if I do say so myself.

35:29.795 --> 35:30.796
But who asked you?

35:30.837 --> 35:33.006
[sighs]

35:30.837 --> 35:33.006
Boy.

35:33.048 --> 35:36.593
Okay, Luke, I'm very sorry.

35:33.048 --> 35:36.593
This won't happen again.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.762
Come on, Kirk.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.762
I am sorry, but why a hot dog?

35:38.804 --> 35:40.472
The Dragonfly

35:38.804 --> 35:40.472
doesn't serve hot dogs.

35:40.513 --> 35:42.015
Well, the quiche

35:40.513 --> 35:42.015
made me look fat.

35:42.057 --> 35:43.433
If I see him

35:42.057 --> 35:43.433
around here again--

35:43.475 --> 35:45.226
You won't.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.226
Let's go, Kirk.

35:45.268 --> 35:47.479
This is as fast as I can go

35:45.268 --> 35:47.479
in this outfit.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.692
I'm talking everything,

35:50.774 --> 35:52.692
it was funny, man.

35:52.734 --> 35:53.860
You should have been there,

35:52.734 --> 35:53.860
it was great.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.028
Hey, Huntzberger.

35:56.446 --> 35:57.781
Hey, you waiting on me?

35:57.823 --> 35:59.699
- Could be.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.699
- Wow, I'm flattered.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.119
- Your prerogative.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.119
- Here on business or pleasure?

36:02.160 --> 36:03.453
I just thought maybe

36:02.160 --> 36:03.453
I'd give you a chance

36:03.495 --> 36:04.496
to respond

36:03.495 --> 36:04.496
to my article.

36:04.537 --> 36:05.622
What article?

36:05.664 --> 36:06.706
The article I'm doing on

36:06.748 --> 36:08.834
the Life And Death Brigade.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.043
Don't really know

36:08.875 --> 36:10.043
what you're talking about.

36:10.085 --> 36:11.461
You don't?

36:11.503 --> 36:13.421
Huh,

36:11.503 --> 36:13.421
I thought you would.

36:13.463 --> 36:15.715
It's a club,

36:13.463 --> 36:15.715
one of these super secret

36:15.757 --> 36:17.509
super exclusive clubs,

36:15.757 --> 36:17.509
here at Yale.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.552
Membership spans

36:17.550 --> 36:19.552
a thousand centuries.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.262
Secret handshakes

36:19.594 --> 36:21.262
and secret sayings

36:21.304 --> 36:23.098
and lotta running around

36:21.304 --> 36:23.098
in a circle in your underwear.

36:23.140 --> 36:24.641
- That kinda thing.

36:23.140 --> 36:24.641
- Sounds pretty secret.

36:24.683 --> 36:28.227
Yeah, anyhow,

36:24.683 --> 36:28.227
I'm doing sort of an exposé

36:28.269 --> 36:29.688
on this one particular club

36:29.729 --> 36:31.230
and I figured,

36:29.729 --> 36:31.230
since you're in it.

36:31.272 --> 36:33.066
Maybe you'd like to have

36:31.272 --> 36:33.066
your point of view included.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.651
- I'm in it?

36:33.108 --> 36:34.651
- Well, aren't you?

36:34.693 --> 36:36.862
Uh, I have yet to run around

36:34.693 --> 36:36.862
in a circle in my underwear.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.947
Well, okay.

36:38.989 --> 36:41.366
I mean, I have proof that your

36:38.989 --> 36:41.366
grandfather was in it.

36:41.407 --> 36:43.035
Which means that

36:41.407 --> 36:43.035
your father was in it.

36:43.076 --> 36:44.911
Which should mean

36:43.076 --> 36:44.911
that you're in it.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.121
But maybe not, okay.

36:46.163 --> 36:47.455
Sorry to let you down.

36:47.497 --> 36:49.374
No letdown,

36:47.497 --> 36:49.374
it would have been nice

36:49.415 --> 36:51.168
but I have plenty of stuff

36:49.415 --> 36:51.168
without you

36:51.209 --> 36:52.335
and I'm sorry to have

36:51.209 --> 36:52.335
bothered you.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.586
You got plenty

36:52.377 --> 36:53.586
without me, huh?

36:53.628 --> 36:55.296
Oh, yeah,

36:53.628 --> 36:55.296
I have the ball gowns

36:55.338 --> 36:57.215
the girl in the gorilla mask

36:57.256 --> 37:00.177
and<i> omnia paratus,</i> very fancy

36:57.256 --> 37:00.177
catchphrase, by the way.

37:00.218 --> 37:03.055
The license plate

37:00.218 --> 37:03.055
on the black SUV

37:03.096 --> 37:04.723
and about a dozen

37:03.096 --> 37:04.723
other little things.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.933
I mean, getting an interview

37:04.764 --> 37:06.933
with an actual member

37:06.975 --> 37:08.101
would have been great

37:08.143 --> 37:09.352
but I'm okay without it.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.021
- Oh, great.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.021
- Yup.

37:11.063 --> 37:12.189
Plus, I'm completely on

37:11.063 --> 37:12.189
to your routine now.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.481
- Wow.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.481
- Yeah.

37:13.523 --> 37:14.983
So, I figured,

37:13.523 --> 37:14.983
I'll just track you

37:15.025 --> 37:16.651
and you'll eventually lead me

37:15.025 --> 37:16.651
there, anyway.

37:16.693 --> 37:18.195
So, hey, I mean,

37:16.693 --> 37:18.195
It would be easier

37:18.236 --> 37:19.654
if you would have

37:18.236 --> 37:19.654
talked to me now

37:19.696 --> 37:21.489
but I can do it

37:19.696 --> 37:21.489
the other way if you want.

37:21.531 --> 37:22.741
- The other way?

37:21.531 --> 37:22.741
- Yes.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.201
- With you tracking me?

37:22.782 --> 37:24.201
- Yes.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.327
- Following my every move?

37:24.242 --> 37:26.327
- Yeah.

37:26.369 --> 37:27.662
- I pick that way.

37:26.369 --> 37:27.662
- Okay, but--

37:27.704 --> 37:28.663
We can start right now

37:27.704 --> 37:28.663
if you want.

37:28.705 --> 37:30.123
I'm heading back to my room.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.166
I'll keep the window

37:30.165 --> 37:31.166
open in case you feel

37:31.208 --> 37:32.291
the need to sneak in

37:32.333 --> 37:33.334
and track me from the inside.

37:33.376 --> 37:34.544
Thanks for the info.

37:34.586 --> 37:35.921
Absolutely.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.797
And, hey, good luck

37:35.962 --> 37:37.797
with that article.

37:37.839 --> 37:38.924
Sounds like a hell

37:37.839 --> 37:38.924
of a scoop.

37:42.802 --> 37:44.846
Sookie, what was

37:42.802 --> 37:44.846
the first thing we agreed on

37:44.888 --> 37:45.889
when we opened the inn?

37:45.931 --> 37:46.973
What?

37:47.015 --> 37:48.725
Keep Kirk away

37:47.015 --> 37:48.725
from the business.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.810
Then I get a call from a not so

37:48.767 --> 37:50.810
jolly Luke and I run down there

37:50.852 --> 37:52.562
and I find a giant hot dog

37:50.852 --> 37:52.562
handing out

37:52.604 --> 37:53.605
10-percent-off flyers

37:53.646 --> 37:54.647
for lunch at The Dragonfly.

37:54.689 --> 37:55.815
Who was the giant hot dog?

37:55.857 --> 37:57.567
Kirk was the giant hot dog.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.069
I didn't tell him to dress

37:57.609 --> 37:59.069
like a giant hot dog.

37:59.111 --> 38:00.695
Why would he dress up

37:59.111 --> 38:00.695
like a giant hot dog?

38:00.737 --> 38:01.988
Because it's Kirk, Sookie.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.406
The giant hot-dog suit

38:02.030 --> 38:03.406
was a given

38:03.448 --> 38:04.783
the minute you talk to Kirk.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.201
I don't understand

38:04.824 --> 38:06.201
what you were thinking.

38:06.243 --> 38:07.285
I was thinking we needed

38:07.326 --> 38:08.536
to drum up

38:07.326 --> 38:08.536
some lunch business.

38:08.578 --> 38:09.871
But there is no lunch.

38:09.913 --> 38:11.164
- Since when?

38:11.206 --> 38:12.373
Sookie, we all agreed.

38:12.415 --> 38:14.000
- Ann said--

38:12.415 --> 38:14.000
- I did not agree.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.002
I did not agree

38:14.042 --> 38:16.002
to stop serving lunch.

38:16.044 --> 38:17.045
Sookie, come on.

38:17.087 --> 38:18.671
It's the only thing

38:17.087 --> 38:18.671
we can do.

38:18.713 --> 38:22.008
We have to. You heard Ann,

38:18.713 --> 38:22.008
we can't afford this.

38:22.050 --> 38:23.051
Who, who is all

38:22.050 --> 38:23.051
this food for?

38:23.093 --> 38:24.427
All we need is a little time.

38:24.469 --> 38:25.971
And the people

38:24.469 --> 38:25.971
are going to come.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.346
And I paid Kirk out of my own

38:26.012 --> 38:27.346
money by the way

38:27.388 --> 38:29.015
so, you don't have

38:27.388 --> 38:29.015
to worry about that.

38:29.057 --> 38:30.142
I'm not worried about that,

38:29.057 --> 38:30.142
I'm worried about this.

38:30.183 --> 38:31.601
What?

38:31.643 --> 38:32.644
'What are we gonna do

38:31.643 --> 38:32.644
with all this food?'

38:32.685 --> 38:33.937
Who is going to eat it?

38:33.979 --> 38:35.730
Why are there

38:33.979 --> 38:35.730
seven kitchen people

38:35.772 --> 38:37.398
working, when the only person

38:35.772 --> 38:37.398
out there is Norman Mailer?

38:37.440 --> 38:38.984
Hey, this is what I do.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.652
Sookie, we're dropping lunch.

38:40.693 --> 38:42.112
It's just temporary,

38:40.693 --> 38:42.112
but as of now

38:42.154 --> 38:43.238
I'm sorry it's gone.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.406
Fine, no lunch.

38:45.448 --> 38:46.741
From now on,

38:45.448 --> 38:46.741
there's no lunch.

38:46.783 --> 38:48.326
Everybody stop

38:46.783 --> 38:48.326
what you're doing

38:48.367 --> 38:50.078
because as of now,

38:48.367 --> 38:50.078
there's no more lunch!

38:51.871 --> 38:55.208
Boys, sorry to break up

38:51.871 --> 38:55.208
the party, but as of now

38:55.250 --> 38:56.251
there's no more lunch!

38:56.293 --> 38:58.044
Yeah, It's been canceled!

38:58.086 --> 38:59.296
You happy,

38:58.086 --> 38:59.296
Norman Mailer, huh?

38:59.337 --> 39:00.672
Lunch has been canceled!

39:00.713 --> 39:03.382
That means no more iced teas!

39:00.713 --> 39:03.382
Uh-huh.

39:03.424 --> 39:05.177
No more lemon slices!

39:05.218 --> 39:06.803
No more hanging out

39:05.218 --> 39:06.803
at a restaurant

39:06.845 --> 39:10.098
ordering nothing because you're

39:06.845 --> 39:10.098
Norman Mailer and you can!

39:10.140 --> 39:12.391
'Ah, I mean, It's just like me

39:10.140 --> 39:12.391
coming into a bookstore'

39:12.433 --> 39:14.644
and reading your books

39:12.433 --> 39:14.644
without buying them!

39:14.686 --> 39:16.771
Hey, can I borrow this, huh?

39:16.813 --> 39:18.397
I'm not gonna pay for it, humph.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.275
Just stand here and read.

39:20.317 --> 39:21.734
Ooh, yeah.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.945
Someone sure likes

39:21.776 --> 39:23.945
to use these big words.

39:23.987 --> 39:25.363
Can I get some more iced tea

39:23.987 --> 39:25.363
for the table?

39:25.404 --> 39:26.948
Excuse me, Mr. Mailer.

39:26.990 --> 39:28.074
I'm terribly sorry.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.408
- Yeah, yeah.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.408
- Can you just--

39:29.450 --> 39:30.743
What? What?

39:32.495 --> 39:34.580
- Yeah, write that down.

39:32.495 --> 39:34.580
- No, no.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.582
- What?

39:34.622 --> 39:36.582
- This is his fault.

39:36.624 --> 39:37.625
It is not his fault.

39:37.667 --> 39:38.751
He takes up space.

39:38.793 --> 39:40.128
He drinks iced tea.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.379
He scares the other

39:40.170 --> 39:41.379
people off.

39:41.420 --> 39:42.755
Sookie, he does not.

39:42.797 --> 39:43.923
Why are you being

39:42.797 --> 39:43.923
so nutty about this?

39:43.965 --> 39:45.508
I don't know, I don't know why

39:45.550 --> 39:46.843
I'm getting so nutty about this.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.427
I mean, I hear myself

39:46.885 --> 39:48.427
getting nutty.

39:48.469 --> 39:50.930
I mean, I-I know that

39:48.469 --> 39:50.930
there's no one coming for lunch.

39:50.972 --> 39:52.974
And I know that Norman Mailer's

39:50.972 --> 39:52.974
not responsible

39:53.016 --> 39:54.475
for no one coming for lunch.

39:54.517 --> 39:56.602
And I tell myself

39:54.517 --> 39:56.602
it's just temporary

39:56.644 --> 39:58.313
and there's still dinner

39:56.644 --> 39:58.313
and breakfast.

39:58.355 --> 40:00.523
And that's good,

39:58.355 --> 40:00.523
and I can do a lot with that.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.067
'And I try to calm myself down'

40:02.108 --> 40:04.402
'and that just only seems

40:02.108 --> 40:04.402
to make me crazier.'

40:04.443 --> 40:07.113
And all I want to do is cry

40:04.443 --> 40:07.113
and scream and..

40:07.155 --> 40:09.157
Oh, my God, I'm pregnant.

40:09.199 --> 40:10.909
[gasps]

40:09.199 --> 40:10.909
You're pregnant?

40:10.950 --> 40:12.285
I'm pregnant!

40:16.497 --> 40:18.457
Norman Mailer,

40:16.497 --> 40:18.457
I'm pregnant!

40:18.499 --> 40:19.625
Congratulations.

40:19.667 --> 40:20.626
[giggling]

40:29.052 --> 40:30.678
- Hey, you okay?

40:29.052 --> 40:30.678
- Yeah.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.472
I think I had some bad host

40:30.720 --> 40:33.472
at one of the masses yesterday.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.728
(female #1 )

40:36.184 --> 40:38.728
'Oh, that's right, I'm sorry.'

40:38.770 --> 40:40.105
'You know what? I'll just give

40:38.770 --> 40:40.105
him a call, send some flowers.'

40:42.357 --> 40:43.691
'Is that cool?'

40:43.733 --> 40:46.152
[indistinct chatter]

41:02.961 --> 41:03.920
[beeps]

41:10.885 --> 41:11.844
[beeps]

41:19.894 --> 41:20.853
[beeps]

41:24.523 --> 41:25.483
[bell rings]

41:27.819 --> 41:28.778
Hey.

41:30.155 --> 41:31.572
Is the hot dog

41:30.155 --> 41:31.572
with you?

41:31.614 --> 41:33.283
No, Kirk is at home.

41:33.325 --> 41:34.909
Good, make sure

41:33.325 --> 41:34.909
he stays there.

41:34.951 --> 41:36.119
I will.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.578
So, you still mad at me?

41:37.620 --> 41:39.122
- Nope.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.122
- You seem mad.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.206
Not mad, just bugged.

41:40.248 --> 41:41.749
Luke, I swear,

41:40.248 --> 41:41.749
Kirk will never

41:41.791 --> 41:43.293
bother your business

41:41.791 --> 41:43.293
on our behalf again.

41:43.335 --> 41:45.128
- Oh, it's not that.

41:43.335 --> 41:45.128
- What, then?

41:45.170 --> 41:47.755
I got this table of bozos

41:45.170 --> 41:47.755
sitting over there all day long

41:47.797 --> 41:49.382
ordering nothing

41:47.797 --> 41:49.382
but iced tea.

41:49.424 --> 41:51.092
(male #1)

41:49.424 --> 41:51.092
Why don't we focus

41:49.424 --> 41:51.092
on-on writing?

41:51.134 --> 41:52.885
Yeah, I knew you'd come up

41:51.134 --> 41:52.885
with a question like that.

41:52.927 --> 41:56.139
It's like, why don't you push

41:52.927 --> 41:56.139
my Cadillac for me?

41:56.181 --> 41:57.515
Oh, bummer.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.396
[knocking]

42:03.438 --> 42:05.190
Rory, hey!

42:03.438 --> 42:05.190
What are you doing here?

42:05.231 --> 42:06.565
I, uh, here.

42:08.693 --> 42:11.404
Hey, it's good

42:08.693 --> 42:11.404
to see you, kiddo.

42:11.446 --> 42:13.614
Uh, come on in,

42:11.446 --> 42:13.614
sit down.

42:13.656 --> 42:16.117
Ah, Gigi is asleep,

42:13.656 --> 42:16.117
which is basically a miracle

42:16.159 --> 42:17.660
but what the hell,

42:16.159 --> 42:17.660
for you, I'll wake her up.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.245
No, that's okay.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.245
I can't stay long.

42:19.287 --> 42:21.414
- Well, come sit down.

42:19.287 --> 42:21.414
- No, I can't stay.

42:21.456 --> 42:22.581
Okay.

42:22.623 --> 42:23.875
I don't want

42:22.623 --> 42:23.875
you calling mom anymore.

42:23.916 --> 42:25.126
What?

42:25.168 --> 42:26.585
I want you

42:25.168 --> 42:26.585
to stay away from her.

42:26.627 --> 42:28.296
- Rory, it--

42:26.627 --> 42:28.296
- Mom's in a relationship now.

42:28.338 --> 42:30.131
And she's doing really great.

42:30.173 --> 42:31.799
He's kind and..

42:31.841 --> 42:33.885
Well, he's there,

42:31.841 --> 42:33.885
and she's happy.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.720
I think that's great, Rory.

42:35.761 --> 42:36.762
- I--

42:35.761 --> 42:36.762
- You'll mess it up.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.014
You'll mess everything up.

42:38.056 --> 42:39.598
Because every time

42:38.056 --> 42:39.598
you come back

42:39.640 --> 42:41.100
it always ends up

42:39.640 --> 42:41.100
the same way.

42:41.142 --> 42:43.353
Mom's crying

42:41.142 --> 42:43.353
and you're not being there.

42:43.395 --> 42:45.522
And, I know it's not your fault.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.023
I know you don't mean it

42:45.563 --> 42:47.023
to be that way

42:47.065 --> 42:48.607
but that's how it is.

42:48.649 --> 42:50.609
I just needed some help,

42:48.649 --> 42:50.609
that's all.

42:50.651 --> 42:51.986
Well, next time you need help

42:52.028 --> 42:54.072
call a nanny or a babysitter

42:54.113 --> 42:55.532
or call me,

42:54.113 --> 42:55.532
just leave mom alone.

42:56.866 --> 42:58.326
I'm sorry.

42:56.866 --> 42:58.326
I have to go.

42:58.368 --> 43:00.537
Kiss Gigi for me.
