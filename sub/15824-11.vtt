WEBVTT

00:38.872 --> 00:41.142
CAPTAIN SHARON RAYDOR.
GOOD EVENING, OFFICER.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.277
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT TIME
THIS LOG WAS STARTED

00:43.311 --> 00:45.579
AND THE NAME OF THE FIRST
SUPERVISOR ON THE SCENE.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.381
THAT WOULD BE ME.

00:47.415 --> 00:48.549
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.384
AND MY ARRIVAL TIME'S
IN THE LOG.

00:50.418 --> 00:53.854
AND I GOT HERE A MINUTE
AFTER HE DID.

00:53.887 --> 00:57.558
LIEUTENANT FLYNN, THAT WOULD PUT
YOU HERE AT 9:43 P.M.,

00:57.591 --> 01:00.161
HALF AN HOUR
AFTER THE CRIME WAS REPORTED.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.330
THAT'S WELL WITHIN
THE REQUIRED RESPONSE TIME.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.132
OH, IT WASN'T A CRITICISM,
LIEUTENANT.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.534
JUST KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL,
EVERYONE,

01:06.567 --> 01:08.669
AND IGNORE ME
LIKE YOU USUALLY DO.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.840
UH, DETECTIVE GABRIEL,

01:12.873 --> 01:14.375
IT SAYS YOU MADE
THE CORONER'S FIRST CALL,

01:14.408 --> 01:15.709
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE A TIME
IN THE LOG.

01:15.743 --> 01:19.247
UH, IT WAS AROUND 9:50.
I TOLD THEM TO RESPOND.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.315
KENDALL'S WITH
THE VICTIM RIGHT NOW.
OKAY.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.154
EXCELLENT JOB, EVERYONE,
BY THE WAY,

01:26.187 --> 01:27.788
OF BLOCKING THE CRIME SCENE
FROM THE PUBLIC.

01:27.821 --> 01:28.822
VERY NICELY DONE.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.862
DOES, UH, ANYONE WANT TO TELL ME
WHEN S.I.D. WAS NOTIFIED?

01:34.895 --> 01:36.264
Tao:
SAME TIME AS THE CORONER.

01:36.297 --> 01:39.200
ARRIVED AT 10:17 P.M.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.402
THEY'RE CURRENTLY WORKING
ON BULLET TRAJECTORIES.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.705
OH, I USUALLY FILL OUT THE LOG
AFTER I'VE ENTERED MY --

01:44.738 --> 01:47.241
LIEUTENANT TAO, THE LOG
IS SUPPOSED TO BE FILLED OUT

01:47.275 --> 01:48.776
CONCURRENT WITH
THE ACTIONS TAKEN.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.244
AND WHILE
THIS FEDERAL LAWSUIT

01:50.278 --> 01:51.679
IS PROCEEDING
THROUGH THE COURTS,

01:51.712 --> 01:54.615
WE MUS BE COMPLIANT
WITH REGULATIONS -- PERIOD.

01:54.648 --> 01:55.883
SORRY.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.785
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.655
ANY PUBLIC

02:01.689 --> 02:03.857
WE HAVEN'T FOUND
THE MURDER WEAPON YET.
PATROL'S LOOKING FOR IT.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.559
AND OUR SUSPECT
COULD STILL BE

02:05.593 --> 02:07.595
IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA --
I CAN'T SAY.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.730
HAVE YOU PUT OUT A CITYWIDE
INFORMATION BROADCAST?

02:09.763 --> 02:11.765
9:45 P.M.
NOTHING'S COME BACK YET.

02:11.799 --> 02:16.604
HAS ANYONE NOTIFIED
DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON?

02:16.637 --> 02:17.771
THEY HAVE.

02:17.805 --> 02:18.839
OH.

02:18.872 --> 02:19.940
I'M SO SORRY, CAPTAIN.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.409
HAVE YOU BEEN
LOOKING FOR ME?

02:21.442 --> 02:22.943
CHIEF JOHNSON,
YOU DIDN'T SIGN

02:22.976 --> 02:25.279
INTO THE LOG
WHEN YOU ARRIVED.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.514
I DIDN'T?

02:26.547 --> 02:28.416
UH, LIEUTENANT,
WHEN DID I ARRIVE?

02:28.449 --> 02:30.384
FROM ATLANTA OR TONIGHT?

02:30.418 --> 02:32.820
Man: READY?

02:32.853 --> 02:34.422
UH, SHE CAME WITH GABRIEL.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.323
1...2...3.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.858
I'M SO SORRY.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.860
CAPTAIN, THAT IS THE VERY LAST
TIME I'LL FORGET TO SIGN IN.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.462
IT'S OKAY.
I'VE GOT IT.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.830
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:42.863 --> 02:45.366
UH, WHY DON'T WE GET AS MANY
OF YOUR QUESTIONS

02:45.399 --> 02:46.767
ANSWERED AS WE CAN
RIGHT NOW?

02:46.800 --> 02:49.270
OKAY. I'M GOING TO ASSUME,
AS USUAL,

02:49.303 --> 02:51.405
YOU ARE
THE INCIDENT COMMANDER.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.407
DO YOU HAVE AN I.D.
ON THE VICTIM?

02:53.441 --> 02:57.278
UH, KENDALL, DO WE HAVE AN I.D.
ON THE VICTIM?

02:57.311 --> 03:00.848
UH, DRIVER'S LICENSE SAYS
MR. JON MILTON REED.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.950
SCHOOL I.D. SAYS HE'S
THE PRINCIPAL AT POLK HIGH.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.685
IT'S NOT FAR FROM HERE.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.454
YEAH, I ASSUMED AS MUCH
FROM WHAT HIS WIFE TOLD US.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.921
TWO GUNSHOT WOUNDS
IN THE CHEST.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.757
THE MARKS ON THE FACE ARE
BRUISES FROM THE AIRBAGS.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.492
THANK YOU, KENDALL.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.327
WAS THAT THE WIFE OUTSIDE --
MRS. REED?

03:13.361 --> 03:16.264
UH, WHAT TIME WAS SHE NOTIFIED
OF HER HUSBAND'S DEATH?

03:16.297 --> 03:18.232
UH, ACTUALLY,
SHE NOTIFIED US.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.468
OKAY. MM.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.709
MRS. REED
SAYS THAT HER HUSBAND

03:28.742 --> 03:30.711
STAYED LATE AT THE SCHOOL
TONIGHT TO MEET WITH PARENTS.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.581
THE VICTIM CALLED HER
WHEN HE WAS ON HIS WAY HOME.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.583
TOLD HER TO HOLD ON
FOR A SECOND,

03:35.616 --> 03:36.950
THAT HE HAD TO DEAL
WITH SOMEONE.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.886
THE NEXT THING SHE HEARD
WAS GUNSHOTS

03:38.919 --> 03:40.488
AND HER HUSBAND SCREAMING.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.690
SO MRS. REE WAS THE ONE
THAT CALLED 911?

03:42.723 --> 03:44.625
YES, MA'AM.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.427
SHE, UH, GAVE THE OFFICERS
THE EXACT ROUTE

03:46.460 --> 03:47.795
HER HUSBAND TOOK HOME
EVERY NIGHT.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.597
THEY FOUND HIM
10 MINUTES LATER.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.932
OKAY. UH, PLEASE CHECK MR.
AND MRS. REED'S PHONE RECORDS.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.801
MAKE SURE THE CALLS BETWEEN THEM
ACTUALLY HAPPENED

03:53.834 --> 03:55.369
BEFORE SHE DIALED 911.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.604
YOU GOT IT, CHIEF.
THANK YOU.

03:56.637 --> 04:00.941
AND, UH, RACR DIVISION'S
BEEN NOTIFIED?

04:00.974 --> 04:02.510
YES.
YES, THEY HAVE.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.017
UH, CHIEF.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.586
S.I.D. PULLED A ROUND
OUT OF THE TRUNK.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.888
LOOKS LIKE OUR MURDER WEAPON'S
A 9mm SEMIAUTOMATIC.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.791
YOU KNOW A SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPON
WAS USED

04:17.825 --> 04:19.460
JUST BY LOOKING
AT A SINGLE BULLET?

04:19.493 --> 04:21.995
WELL, CAPTAIN, A REVOLVER
HAS SIX ROUNDS IN IT.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.532
AND ADDING UP THE BULLET HOLES
IN THE CAR

04:24.565 --> 04:26.834
AND THE TWO IN THE VICTIM,
WE MAKE SEVEN,

04:26.867 --> 04:28.402
WHICH MEANS THE MURDER WEAPON
HAD A CLIP.

04:28.436 --> 04:29.903
I WASN'T ASKING FOR A LESSON

04:29.937 --> 04:32.340
IN ELEMENTARY BALLISTICS,
LIEUTENANT.

04:32.373 --> 04:35.676
I SIMPLY WANT TO KNOW IF YOU ARE
ASSUMING A SINGLE SHOOTER.

04:35.709 --> 04:36.944
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.449
WELL, UM, YEAH.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.083
OKAY.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.353
WHERE ARE THE CASINGS?

04:45.386 --> 04:46.920
WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME
TO LOOK FOR THEM YET.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.022
WE ASSUMED THAT,
ONCE MR. REED WAS SHOT,

04:49.056 --> 04:50.891
HE DROVE AWAY
AS FAST AS HE COULD.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.726
UNFORTUNATELY, WE DON'T KNOW
HOW FAR OUR VICTIM TRAVELED

04:52.760 --> 04:54.662
BEFORE HE PASSED OUT
FROM BLOOD LOSS,

04:54.695 --> 04:57.965
WHICH CAUSED HIM TO CRASH
INTO OUR POLE HERE.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.968
YEAH, THANKS.
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING RIGHT HERE.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.603
OH, ACCORDING TO
RACR DIVISION, CHIEF --

05:02.636 --> 05:04.672
I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME
YOU'D ALREADY NOTIFIED RACR.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.807
WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM, CAPTAIN.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.076
SOMETIMES THEY CALL BACK.
GO ON, LIEUTENANT.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.944
ACCORDING TO RACR,

05:10.978 --> 05:12.746
THERE WAS ANOTHER CAR-INVOLVED
SHOOTING ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.848
THE DRIVER ESCAPED
WITHOUT INJURY. BUT GET THIS --

05:14.882 --> 05:17.785
THE GUN INVOLVED WAS
A 9mm SEMIAUTOMATIC,

05:17.818 --> 05:22.089
AND THE CAR INVOLVED
WAS A DARK-GRAY BMW 740iL.

05:23.524 --> 05:24.825
JUST LIKE THIS ONE.
MM.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.094
AND THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE
AROUND HERE?

05:27.127 --> 05:28.662
TWO BLOCKS NORTH OF HERE

05:28.696 --> 05:30.764
AT THE CORNER OF BOYCE
AND FORBES.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.500
OKAY.
UH, LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,

05:32.533 --> 05:33.734
WHILE WE GO LOOK
FOR THE CASINGS,

05:33.767 --> 05:35.068
WOULD YOU HOLD DOWN
THE CRIME SCENE?

05:35.102 --> 05:36.136
THANK YOU.
YES, MA'AM.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.705
AND I'LL MAKE DOUBLY SURE

05:37.738 --> 05:40.374
THAT ALL OF OUR LOG ENTRIES
ARE PROPERLY MADE.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.085
Tao: SEE, OKAY.
MAYBE AROUND HERE.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.522
THE DRIVER OF THE LAST VEHICLE
SAID THE SHOOTER

05:54.555 --> 05:56.824
RAN OUT OF A DRIVEWAY
AND OPENED FIRE IN THIS AREA.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.092
Brenda: WAS THERE A DESCRIPTION
OF THE ASSAILANT?

05:59.126 --> 06:01.161
UH, NEGATIVE.

06:02.930 --> 06:06.567
Gabriel: HEY, CHIEF.
FOUND A CASING.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.135
Buzz:
TWO MORE OVER HERE.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.070
I'VE GOT FOUR HERE, CHIEF.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.839
ALL RIGHT.
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,

06:11.872 --> 06:13.441
BEFORE CAPTAIN RAYDOR
HAS A CHANCE TO ASK ABOUT IT...

06:13.474 --> 06:15.175
I'LL MAKE SURE THE CASINGS
GET ENTERED IN TONIGHT.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.444
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.579
WOW.
THIS IS INTERESTING.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.780
WHAT?

06:19.813 --> 06:20.914
THERE'S INFORMATION WANTED

06:20.948 --> 06:22.616
ON A SHOOTING
AT THE CORNER

06:22.650 --> 06:24.518
OF BOYCE ROAD
AND FORBES AVENUE.

06:24.552 --> 06:27.087
CONTACT THE LOS ANGELES
FBI OFFICE.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.957
WHAT?!
WHY IS THE FBI INVOLVED?

06:29.990 --> 06:32.793
Fritz: EIGHT SHOTS WERE FIRED
AT A TSA AGENT

06:32.826 --> 06:34.795
AS HE WAS DRIVING HOME
FROM WORK ONE NIGHT

06:34.828 --> 06:35.863
ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.098
THAT'S WHY WE'RE INVOLVED.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.500
OH. YOU MEAN
WHY YOU WERE INVOLVED.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.168
EXCUSE ME,
SPECIAL AGENT HOWARD.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.637
DID YOU FIND THE CASINGS FROM
THE ATTACK ON THE TSA AGENT?

06:43.671 --> 06:44.838
YES.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.073
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"WERE INVOLVED"?

06:46.106 --> 06:47.575
WELL, I'M THE ONE
WITH THE VICTIM.

06:47.608 --> 06:48.709
AND WERE THE CASINGS
ENTERED IN NIBIN?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.010
YES, CAPTAIN.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.545
AND BY THE WAY,
I DON'T WORK FOR YOU.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.781
SO, CHIEF,
WE SHOULD COMPARE THE CASINGS.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.215
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ ALREADY
ENTERED OUR CASINGS INTO NIBIN.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.050
THIS IS NOT YOUR CASE, BRENDA.
THIS IS OURS.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.952
SINCE WHEN DOES THE FBI CARE
ABOUT HIGH

06:58.986 --> 07:00.821
A TSA AGENT WAS FIRED UPON!

07:00.854 --> 07:02.990
DRIVING THE SAME TYPE OF CAR
AS MY VICTIM.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.025
SO, UNLESS YOU THINK
THAT THE KILLER

07:05.058 --> 07:07.127
JUST REALLY, REALLY HATES
GERMAN CARS,

07:07.160 --> 07:09.597
THEN YOUR TSA AGENT WAS MISTAKEN
FOR MY PRINCIPAL.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.765
OR YOUR PRINCIPAL WAS MISTAKEN
FOR MY TSA AGENT.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.166
WELL, NOW YOU'RE JUST
BEING SILLY.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.902
CHIEF.
GABRIEL'S READY.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.470
THANK YOU, LIEUTENANT.

07:16.504 --> 07:17.871
WELL, I'M NOT LEAVING.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.473
WELL, YOU CAN STAY HERE
AS LONG AS YOU LIKE,

07:19.507 --> 07:20.941
BUT IT'S STILL
MY MURDER.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.943
AND IF YOU DON'T GO HOME SOON
AND GET SOME REST,

07:22.976 --> 07:24.945
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
WITH A VERY BAD CASE

07:24.978 --> 07:26.814
OF THE GRUMPY-UGLIES.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.616
Raydor:
CHIEF JOHNSON...

07:28.649 --> 07:30.884
MRS. REED SHOULD BE MEETING
WITH A GRIEF COUNSELOR,

07:30.918 --> 07:32.520
NOT DETECTIVE GABRIEL.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.954
WE'RE ALL GRIEF COUNSELORS
HERE, CAPTAIN.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.789
BESIDES, THERE'S NO BETTER TIME
TO INTERVIEW THE WIFE

07:35.823 --> 07:37.057
THAN WHEN SHE'S FEELING
THIS VULNERABLE.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.626
IF SHE'S A SUSPECT,
THEN WE NEED TO MIRAND--

07:38.659 --> 07:40.160
NO, SHE IS
A PERSON OF INTEREST,

07:40.193 --> 07:43.997
SO WE DON'T NEED
TO MIRANDIZE HER.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.699
LOOK, CAPTAIN,
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME

07:45.733 --> 07:47.601
SOMEBODY SHOT AT A SILVER BMW
ON THAT CORNER.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.737
AND THE KILLER'S RUNNING AROUND
THE STREETS OF L.A.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.505
WITH A SEMIAUTOMATIC
WEAPON.

07:51.539 --> 07:54.241
MY FIRST RESPONSIBILITY IS TO
TAKE HIM OR HER OFF THE STREET.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.847
WHAT IS IT?

08:01.582 --> 08:03.183
ASKING ALL THESE QUESTIONS

08:03.216 --> 08:06.253
AT EVERY ONE OF YOUR CRIME
SCENES FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS,

08:06.286 --> 08:08.288
I AM FEELING
LESS LIKE A CAPTAIN

08:08.321 --> 08:10.824
AND MORE LIKE A HALL MONITOR
EVERY DAY.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.160
I UNDERSTAND
THE IMPORTANCE

08:13.193 --> 08:15.195
OF THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT
WE ARE FACING,

08:15.228 --> 08:18.666
BUT I AM NOT CONVINCED
THAT MY CONSTANT PRESENCE

08:18.699 --> 08:20.534
IN YOUR DIVISION
IS NECESSARY.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.069
AND THERE IS
SOMETHING ELSE --

08:22.102 --> 08:23.804
THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE

08:23.837 --> 08:25.773
THAT I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO TELL YOU.
EXCUSE ME.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.174
CHIEF, WE'RE ON.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.842
OH. JUST ONE SECOND.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.211
Mrs. Reed: I DON'T NEED
A GRIEF COUNSELOR.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.780
I WANT TO KNOW
WHO KILLED JON.

08:32.813 --> 08:35.082
THE L.A.P.D. IS TRYING
TO FIND THAT OUT,

08:35.115 --> 08:37.618
MA'AM, BUT THIS PROCESS,

08:37.651 --> 08:38.952
THIS INVESTIGATION,

08:38.986 --> 08:41.589
WILL BE HORRIBLY STRESSFUL
FOR YOU.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.156
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
I'M HERE TO HELP YOU.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.326
AND I REALIZE
TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

08:46.359 --> 08:48.929
WON'T TAKE AWAY THE PAIN
THAT YOU'RE FEELING RIGHT NOW.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.297
BUT IT'S MY HOPE

08:50.330 --> 08:53.601
THAT IT MIGHT HELP YOU
TO PROCESS IT, OKAY?

08:53.634 --> 08:55.969
NOW, AS HARD
AS THIS MAY BE,

08:56.003 --> 08:58.572
ONE OF THE BEST WAYS
TO BEGIN

08:58.606 --> 09:01.709
IS TO START
WITH A RECENT CONVERSATION,

09:01.742 --> 09:04.111
LIKE MAYBE THE ONE
YOU HAD WITH YOUR HUSBAND

09:04.144 --> 09:05.879
THIS MORNING
BEFORE WORK.

09:05.913 --> 09:08.148
CAN YOU THINK OF ANY ISSUES,
CONCERNS, OR REGRETS,

09:08.181 --> 09:10.150
OR MAYBE SOMETHING
YOU WISH YOU HAD SAID?

09:10.183 --> 09:12.820
I WOULD SAY, "PLEASE,

09:12.853 --> 09:15.055
"I WANT YOU TO QUIT
THIS NEW SCHOOL

09:15.088 --> 09:18.191
AND GO BACK TO THE ONE
WHERE WE'D...BEEN SO HAPPY."

09:18.225 --> 09:20.594
WHY DIDN'T I SAY THAT
TO HIM?

09:20.628 --> 09:21.995
WHY?

09:22.029 --> 09:23.764
OKAY, SO YOUR HUSBAND
RECENTLY CHANGED JOBS?

09:23.797 --> 09:28.035
HE WAS ALWAYS CHANGING JOBS,
STRAIGHTENING OUT SCHOOLS.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.970
AND THIS NEW ONE --

09:30.003 --> 09:33.240
POLK -- I MEAN, HE HAD HAD
SOME TOUGH ASSIGNMENTS,

09:33.273 --> 09:34.842
BUT POLK WAS HORRIBLE.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.376
HIS FIRST DAY THERE,
SOMEONE KEYED OUR CAR,

09:36.409 --> 09:38.078
PROBABLY A FACULTY MEMBER.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.212
AND THERE WERE THREATS,
TOO --

09:39.246 --> 09:40.814
LOTS OF THREATS.

09:40.848 --> 09:43.617
DID YOU REPORT ANY OF THESE
THREATS TO THE L.A.P.D.?

09:43.651 --> 09:45.653
OH, GOD.
JON WOULDN'T.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.855
HE THOUGHT RECORDING EVERYTHING
WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.322
WAIT.
RECORDING EVERYTHING?

09:49.356 --> 09:53.694
HE, UH, MADE VOICE MEMOS
OF HIS MEETINGS

09:53.727 --> 09:56.830
WITH THOSE...
DANGEROUS STUDENTS

09:56.864 --> 10:00.968
AND CRAZY TEACHERS AND ANGRY
PARENTS WITH HIS PHONE,

10:01.001 --> 10:06.006
THE PHONE THAT
WE WERE TALKING ON WHEN

10:06.039 --> 10:07.975
MRS. REED, I'M...

10:08.008 --> 10:12.012
VERY, VERY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR LOSS.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.414
OKAY? WE'RE GONNA DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.650
I THINK THAT'S ALL WE'RE GONNA
GET OUT OF HER TONIGHT.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.786
AT LEAST WE HAVE
A PLACE TO START.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.620
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
THOSE VOICE MEMOS.

10:21.822 --> 10:27.227
SO WOULD I, BUT MR. REED'S PHONE
IS PASSWORD-PROTECTED.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.429
MAYBE THE WIFE CAN PULL IT
TOGETHER LONG ENOUGH

10:29.462 --> 10:32.365
TO GIVE US THE CODE.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.735
I'M SO SORRY, CAPTAIN.
YOU WERE SAYING?

10:41.408 --> 10:44.111
Pope:
ACCORDING TO THEIR LOGS,

10:44.144 --> 10:45.345
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE
MAJOR CRIMES DOING EVERYTHING
TO THE LETTER.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.180
BUT, IF I MAY BE FRANK,
SIR,

10:47.214 --> 10:49.883
CONTINUING TO AUDIT
EVERY INVESTIGATION

10:49.917 --> 10:52.853
CHIEF JOHNSON UNDERTAKES
IS AN EMBARRASSMENT

10:52.886 --> 10:54.755
TO EVERYONE INVOLVED.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.389
IT'S AN INSULT TO HER,
DEMEANING TO MY RANK --

10:56.423 --> 10:58.425
NOT TO MENTION
A WASTE OF MONEY.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.394
CAPTAIN, WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID
ADDING MORE PLAINTIFFS

11:01.428 --> 11:04.464
TO THIS FEDERAL LAWSUIT
AGAINST US

11:04.497 --> 11:06.399
THAT COULD END UP COSTING
THE CITY AND THIS DEPARTMENT

11:06.433 --> 11:08.168
LIKE $50 MILLION.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.770
SO, BELIEVE ME --

11:09.803 --> 11:11.104
YOUR EFFORTS HERE ARE NOT
A WASTE OF MONEY.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.239
Taylor: IF I MAY, SIR.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.707
UH, CAPTAIN,

11:13.741 --> 11:15.843
YOU'RE NOT JUST AUDITING
MAJOR CRIMES --

11:15.876 --> 11:18.979
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FINDING
THE LEAK IN THEIR DIVISION.

11:19.012 --> 11:22.883
WE HAVE TO CUT OFF GOLDMAN'S
SOURCE OF INSIDE INFORMATION.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.886
SINCE CHIEF JOHNSON
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE TAKING
THIS VERY SERIOUSLY,

11:25.919 --> 11:27.788
I'M COUNTING ON YOU
TO FIX THAT FOR US.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.191
I'VE HAD A JOB OFFER.

11:34.427 --> 11:38.966
DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL THREATS
AND CORPORATE SECURITY

11:38.999 --> 11:40.934
AT THE LOS ANGELES
CONVENTION CENTER.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.369
YOU'RE QUITTING?

11:42.402 --> 11:44.237
I'M ELIGIBLE TO COLLECT
MY CAPTAIN'S PENSION,

11:44.271 --> 11:47.207
AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S TIME
TO WORK SOMEPLACE

11:47.240 --> 11:49.877
WHERE PEOPLE
MIGHT BE GLAD TO SEE ME.

11:49.910 --> 11:54.882
CAPTAIN, DO NOT FEEL
THAT YOU ARE UNAPPRECIATED.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.349
I WALK INTO A ROOM --
IT GOES SILENT.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.885
I CAN'T SAY HELLO
TO ANYONE

11:57.918 --> 11:59.920
OUTSIDE THE PROFESSIONAL
STANDARDS BUREAU

11:59.953 --> 12:01.454
WITHOUT PROVOKING
A DEFENSIVE RESPONSE.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.757
BETWEEN THAT AND A FEW THINGS
IN MY PERSONAL LIFE,

12:03.791 --> 12:06.293
I FEEL THAT IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO GO.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.828
CAPTAIN,
YOU CANN RETIRE RIGHT NOW.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.429
NO ONE ELSE IS NEARLY
AS FAMILIAR

12:09.462 --> 12:11.298
WITH THIS FEDERAL CASE
AGAINST US.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.101
AND, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT
TO YOUR ISSUES,

12:14.134 --> 12:16.069
MAJOR CRIMES IS RUN
BY A DEPUTY CHIEF

12:16.103 --> 12:17.437
AND THREE LIEUTENANTS.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.406
REPLACING YOU WITH
A LOWER-RANKING OFFICER --

12:19.439 --> 12:20.841
I-IT'S NOT EVEN POSSIBLE.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.475
I HAVE NO ONE ELSE
FOR THIS JOB.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.783
I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.
I'M SORRY, SIR.

12:36.023 --> 12:38.091
ALL RIGHT.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.227
WHEN THE PROMOTIONS FREEZE
IS OVER,

12:40.260 --> 12:42.062
I WILL MAKE YOU
A COMMANDER.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.867
WOW.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.869
THAT'S QUITE AN OFFER,
CAPTAIN.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.772
THANK YOU, CHIEF.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.943
BUT I FEEL
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.450
WILL YOU AT LEAST
GIVE ME A FEW WEEKS

13:03.483 --> 13:05.819
BEFORE YOU MAKE
THIS DECISION?

13:05.853 --> 13:08.956
AND UNTIL YOUR NOTICE
IS FINAL,

13:08.989 --> 13:11.925
I ASK THAT YOU TREAT THIS ISSUE
OF A POTENTIAL LEAK

13:11.959 --> 13:13.827
LIKE THE CRISIS
IT'S BECOME.

13:17.430 --> 13:20.400
Woman: 911.
WHAT IS YOUR EMERGENCY?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.970
MY HUSBAND'S BEEN SHOT!
SOMEBODY SHOT MY HUSBAND!

13:23.003 --> 13:24.204
STAY WITH ME, MA'AM.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.006
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE YOUR HUSBAND IS?

13:26.039 --> 13:29.242
I-I THINK -- I DON'T THINK
HE REACHED THE FREEWAY YET,

13:29.276 --> 13:31.178
SO -- SO HE WOULD BE
SOMEWHERE ON BOYCE ROAD.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.946
YOU NEED TO GET
SOMEONE THERE NOW. HURRY.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.314
I HAVE UNITS RESPONDING.
I-I HEARD SHOTS!

13:34.347 --> 13:35.916
OKAY, THANK YOU, BUZZ.
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

13:35.949 --> 13:39.086
WELL, IT'S HARD TO BE
ON A LAND LINE AT HOME

13:39.119 --> 13:40.954
WHILE SHOOTING YOUR HUSBAND
AT AN INTERSECTION ACROSS TOWN.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.223
THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE COULDN'T
HAVE HIRED SOMEBODY TO DO IT.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.859
YEAH, WELL, THEIR FINANCIALS
DON'T SHOW ANYTHING GOOFY.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.861
NOT ONLY DOES SHE NOT HAVE
THE CASH FOR A HIT --

13:47.895 --> 13:49.229
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
THE HEART.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.431
IT COULD STILL BE A CASE
OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.200
Brenda: IT IS.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.903
THE FBI MISTAKENLY IDENTIFIED
THIS AS A FEDERAL CRIME.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.038
CHIEF!
WE HAVE VERY GOOD NEWS.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.507
MRS. REED REMEMBERED THE
PASSCODE ON HER HUSBAND'S CELL?

14:00.540 --> 14:03.410
NO. I-IN FACT,
AFTER A FEW FAILED ATTEMPTS,

14:03.443 --> 14:05.345
WE WERE LOCKED OUT
OF THE PHONE,

14:05.378 --> 14:08.581
SO WE CAN'T USE IT TO ACCESS
ANY VOICE MEMOS.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.283
AND THIS IS
GOOD NEWS HOW?

14:10.317 --> 14:13.320
THE VICTIM SYNCHED HIS PHONE
TO HIS COMPUTER AT WORK, SIR.

14:13.353 --> 14:17.324
I HAVE ALL
THE VOICE MEMOS RIGHT HERE.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.392
AND THE LAST TWO RECORDINGS HE
MADE BEFORE BEING SHOT TO DEATH

14:19.426 --> 14:20.593
ARE PRETTY INTERESTING.

14:20.627 --> 14:24.631
AND HERE...WE GO.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.969
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.104
PLEASE, EVERYONE.
PLEASE.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.941
I UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE
HAS THEIR PERSONAL CONCERNS.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.976
AND I PROMISE TO STAND HERE
AND EXPLAIN EVERYTHING

14:36.009 --> 14:37.344
UNTIL EACH ONE OF YOU
UNDERSTANDS

14:37.377 --> 14:39.146
WHAT WE'RE DOING
AT THIS SCHOOL AND WHY.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.280
MA'AM? MA'AM.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.115
MY NAME IS
GINA TOMPKINS,

14:42.149 --> 14:44.952
AND MY SON DENNIS HAS PLAYED
FIRST-STRING FOOTBALL

14:44.985 --> 14:46.253
SINCE HIS SOPHOMORE YEAR.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.956
NOW, COACH CARR TOLD ME

14:48.989 --> 14:52.025
THAT DENNIS HAS A REAL
SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITY HERE.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.660
NOW, IF YOU DISCONTINUE
THE TEAM,

14:53.693 --> 14:56.029
THEN HOW ARE WE GONNA...
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.530
PLEASE, HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.232
LET ME SAY THIS AGAIN.

14:59.266 --> 15:02.669
I'M NOT DISCONTINUING FOOTBALL
OR ANY OTHER SPORT.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.938
I'M ONLY CHANGING
THE ELIGIBILITY RULES,

15:04.972 --> 15:07.307
SO THAT KIDS WHO NEED EXTRA TIME
IN THE CLASSROOM

15:07.340 --> 15:08.608
DON'T LOSE IT ON THE FIELD.

15:08.641 --> 15:12.179
WHOA, WHOA.
CHANGING ELIGIBILITY HOW?

15:12.212 --> 15:14.514
THAT'S A GOOD --
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.516
TO PLAY FOOTBALL
OR TO PARTICIPATE

15:16.549 --> 15:19.119
IN ANY EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY
HERE AT POLK,

15:19.152 --> 15:21.688
STUDENTS WILL HAVE TO MAINTAIN
A "C" GRADE AVERAGE.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.091
NOW, THIS ISN'T MY ONLY --
PLEASE, LISTEN TO ME.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.159
LISTEN TO -- WAIT.
LISTEN TO ME.

15:26.193 --> 15:27.494
SCHOOLS DO NOT REMAIN OPEN

15:27.527 --> 15:29.362
BASED ON THE RANKING
OF THEIR FOOTBALL TEAMS.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.730
THE ONLY SCORE THAT MATTERS

15:30.763 --> 15:32.599
IS WHAT THEY MAKE
ON THAT STANDARDIZED TEST.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.135
AND IF YOUR KIDS -- IF YOUR KIDS
DO AS BADLY ON THAT TEST

15:35.168 --> 15:36.436
AS THEY DID LAST YEAR,

15:36.469 --> 15:38.038
THERE WON'T BE
A FOOTBALL TEAM ANYMORE

15:38.071 --> 15:39.372
BECAUSE THIS SCHOOL WILL CLOSE.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.707
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
PLEASE.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.342
WHAT DOES COACH CARR HAVE TO SAY
ABOUT THIS?

15:42.375 --> 15:44.111
Crowd members: YEAH!

15:44.144 --> 15:45.979
THIS ISN'T A COACH CARR ISSUE.
PLEASE.

15:46.013 --> 15:48.381
THIS IS...

15:48.415 --> 15:50.017
Coach Carr:
OKAY, LISTEN.

15:50.050 --> 15:53.686
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT MAINTAINING
A DECENT GPA

15:53.720 --> 15:57.024
IS OUT OF REACH FOR ANY STUDENT
IN THIS SCHOOL.

15:57.057 --> 16:02.295
NOW, IT MAY MEAN THAT WE HAVE
TO WORK A LITTLE HARDER,

16:02.329 --> 16:04.564
BUT WE'RE NOT STRANGERS
TO THAT, RIGHT?

16:04.597 --> 16:06.466
Crowd members: RIGHT!

16:06.499 --> 16:09.236
THANK YOU, COACH CARR.

16:09.269 --> 16:12.505
NOW, THE ISSUE
OF SCHOLASTIC APPROVALS --

16:12.539 --> 16:14.241
YOU'RE THE ISSUE HERE,
REED!

16:15.475 --> 16:17.444
CLASS ISN'T
JUST ABOUT BOOKS.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.246
MY BOY NEEDS TO LEARN
WHAT IT MEANS TO WIN.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.348
HE NEEDS TO FEEL THAT.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.116
'CAUSE THERE'S NOT A LOT
OF WINNING AROUND HERE --
YOU UNDERSTAND?

16:23.150 --> 16:24.684
LISTEN,
I DO UNDERSTAND THAT.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.453
OKAY. TURN IT OFF.
THANK YOU.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.189
WENT FROM HAVING NO SUSPECTS
TO HAVING A WHOLE ROOMFUL.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.390
Tao:
NOT NECESSARILY.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.125
10 MINUTES
AFTER THIS CONFERENCE,

16:32.159 --> 16:34.061
PRINCIPAL REED
HAD ANOTHER MEETING.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.562
Reed: NOW IS NOT
A GOOD TIME, RICH.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.364
Coach Carr:
NEVER A GOOD TIME, IS IT?

16:37.397 --> 16:38.265
W

16:38.298 --> 16:39.599
UH, RICHARD CARR,

16:39.632 --> 16:42.102
THE FOOTBALL COACH
FROM THE FIRST RECORDING.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.636
THIS PLAN TO GET RID OF ME
ISN'T GOING OVER SO WELL.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.773
YOU'RE NOT BEING FIRED.
YOU'RE BEING TRANSFERRED.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.408
RIGHT, RIGHT.
TO -- TO WHAT DID YOU CALL IT --

16:48.441 --> 16:50.210
A SCHOOL
WITH FEWER PROBLEMS?

16:50.243 --> 16:51.611
AND BY "PROBLEMS,"

16:51.644 --> 16:53.313
YOU MEAN THE CHILDREN
WHO NEED ME THE MOST.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.681
NO.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.583
I MEAN KIDS WHO ARE DRAGGING
DOWN EVERYONE ELSE

16:56.616 --> 16:57.750
WHO WANTS TO EXCEL,

16:57.784 --> 16:59.386
THE KIDS
WHO DON'T WANT TO BE HERE,

16:59.419 --> 17:01.188
WHO HAPPEN TO BE THE VERY KIDS
YOU'RE BEGGING TO STAY.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.156
SINCE WHEN WAS IT OUR JOB

17:03.190 --> 17:06.226
TO SHOVE THESE BOYS AND GIRLS
OUT OF CLASS?

17:06.259 --> 17:09.629
SINCE FUNDING BECAME ATTACHED
TO TEST SCORES.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.665
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP ACTING
LIKE IT'S 1990.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.301
LISTEN TO ME, JON.
OKAY, LISTEN.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.802
L-- JUST LISTEN.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.637
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE
HYPER-FOCUSED

17:17.670 --> 17:19.539
ON THE ISSUE OF GRADES.

17:19.572 --> 17:22.609
BUT IF YOU PUT THE KIDS ON
THE STREET IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,

17:22.642 --> 17:24.411
THEY END UP IN JAIL
OR WORSE!

17:24.444 --> 17:27.080
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL --

17:27.114 --> 17:28.781
IT'S A POSSIBLE
DEATH SENTENCE!

17:28.815 --> 17:30.583
THEN IMAGINE THE WHOLE SCHOOL
BEING SHUT DOWN,

17:30.617 --> 17:31.784
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN

17:31.818 --> 17:32.852
IF I CAN'T GET
OUR SCORES UP.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.855
LOOK, FACE IT.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.191
YOU DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO
MAKE THE HARD DECISIONS HERE,

17:38.225 --> 17:39.659
AND YOU HAVE TO GO.

17:39.692 --> 17:43.363
WH-- HEY! YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT GUTS!

17:43.396 --> 17:44.864
YOU THINK YOU'RE A HERO

17:44.897 --> 17:46.633
BECAUSE YOU'RE WILLING
TO PUT IT ALL ON THE LINE

17:46.666 --> 17:48.101
FOR A FEW INDIVIDUALS?

17:48.135 --> 17:49.436
I'M TRYING TO SAVE
THE WHOLE SCHOOL,

17:49.469 --> 17:50.737
AND YOU'RE AN IMPEDIMENT
TO THAT -- YOU JUST ARE!

17:50.770 --> 17:52.305
AND YOU'RE LEAVING!
I'LL FIGHT TO STAY.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.606
TAKE YOUR BEST SHOT, RICH,

17:53.640 --> 17:54.807
BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU,
I'LL TAKE MINE.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.309
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

17:56.343 --> 17:58.278
THIS CLOSE --

17:58.311 --> 18:00.280
I'M THIS CLOSE TO PHONING
THE DISTRICT

18:00.313 --> 18:02.282
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
AT YOUR HOUSE.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.550
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.884
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

18:04.917 --> 18:07.454
TAKE THE TRANSFER
AND BE THANKFUL.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.327
I WON THESE TROPHIES...

18:14.361 --> 18:16.463
AND YOU DON'T EVEN DESERVE
TO LOOK AT THEM.

18:16.496 --> 18:20.400
NOW WE'RE ALL CAUGHT UP,
COACH CARR.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.469
WANT TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF?

18:24.837 --> 18:26.906
HE RECORDED
OUR CONVERSATIONS.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.408
I MEAN,
IS THAT EVEN LEGAL?

18:28.441 --> 18:29.609
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT
RIGHT NOW.

18:29.642 --> 18:30.843
I CAN'T ARREST
MR. REED ANYMORE.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.212
BUT HE DID BRING UP
SEVERAL POINTS

18:32.245 --> 18:34.281
THAT I THINK
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.316
POINTS
NO, HE HAD NO POINTS.

18:36.349 --> 18:37.817
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

18:37.850 --> 18:39.786
TO HAVE SOMEONE STANDING OVER
YOUR SHOULDER DAY AND NIGHT,

18:39.819 --> 18:42.222
LOOKING FOR THAT ONE THING
THAT COULD GET YOU FIRED?

18:42.255 --> 18:44.291
A LITTLE, YES.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.360
WELL, THAT'S WHAT REED DOES --
OR DID.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.729
HE WANTED TO GET RID
OF TEACHERS LIKE ME.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.231
TEACHERS LIKE YOU?

18:51.264 --> 18:52.665
YEAH.

18:52.699 --> 18:55.268
SEE, I PERSONALLY CALL
SEVERAL STUDENTS EVERY MORNING

18:55.302 --> 18:56.569
JUST TO GET THEM
OUT OF BED

18:56.603 --> 18:58.538
BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS
COULDN'T CARE LESS.

18:58.571 --> 19:01.408
AND OF COURSE, THESE KIDS --
THEY'VE GOT TROUBLES,

19:01.441 --> 19:03.276
BUT PUTTING THEM ON THE STREET
WON'T HELP THEM!

19:03.310 --> 19:05.578
IT WILL, HOWEVER,
DRIVE UP TEST SCORES,

19:05.612 --> 19:08.915
WHICH IS ALL
THAT REED CARED ABOUT.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.450
SO YOU WANTED TO STOP HIM.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.485
YEAH -- BUT NOT BY KILLING HIM.
COME ON.

19:12.519 --> 19:13.920
YOU SOUNDED PRETTY MAD.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.522
OH, WOW.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.324
YOU -- YOU ARE A GREAT
DETECTIVE, AREN'T YOU?

19:17.357 --> 19:18.758
I MEAN, YOU COULD TELL
THAT I WAS MAD?

19:18.791 --> 19:22.329
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.
OF COURSE I WAS MAD!

19:22.362 --> 19:24.464
I'VE TAUGHT AT THAT SCHOOL
FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS!

19:24.497 --> 19:27.400
IT'S MY LIFE'S WORK,
AND WHAT DID I GET FOR IT?

19:27.434 --> 19:28.401
Flynn:
HERE'S YOUR WARRANT.

19:28.435 --> 19:29.702
OKAY, REMEMBER,

19:29.736 --> 19:31.804
WE'RE ONLY GOING THROUGH
COACH CARR'S HOUSE

19:31.838 --> 19:32.839
LOOKING FOR TROPHIES.

19:32.872 --> 19:33.940
STOLEN TROPHIES.

19:33.973 --> 19:34.974
L.A.P.D.!

19:35.007 --> 19:36.276
SEARCH WARRANT!

19:37.644 --> 19:39.846
Raydor: PLEASE, BUZZ,
DOCUMENT EVERYTHING

19:39.879 --> 19:41.314
BEFORE YOU START TEARING UP
THE HOUSE!

19:41.348 --> 19:42.882
OKAY. OKAY, GABRIEL,
TAKE THE RIGHT.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.518
FLYNN, TAKE THAT ROOM
THERE ON THE LEFT.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.755
UH, TAO, SANCHEZ, YOU GUYS,
UH, CHECK OUTSIDE THE BACK.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.923
OKAY, NOW, REMEMBER, GUYS,
YOU CAN PUT A --

19:50.957 --> 19:53.326
A GUN ANYPLACE
YOU COULD PUT A TROPHY,

19:53.360 --> 19:54.661
SO IF YOU COME ACROSS
THE WEAPON,

19:54.694 --> 19:57.397
IT'S LEGAL TO GRAB IT.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.665
Gabriel: HEY, LIEUTENANT,
CHECK THIS OUT.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.934
DOESN'T COACH CARR
LIVE ALONE?

20:01.968 --> 20:03.636
Provenza: YEAH.
YEAH, HE DOES.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.438
THERE'S ANOTHER
BEDROOM HERE, TOO.

20:05.472 --> 20:06.639
THERE'S ONE OVER HERE,
AS WELL.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.874
LOOKS PRETTY LIVED-IN.

20:13.746 --> 20:14.881
DID YOU GUYS HEAR THAT?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.755
OVER HERE.
OVER HERE!

20:37.904 --> 20:39.539
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:39.572 --> 20:41.608
YOU GUYS OKAY?

20:41.641 --> 20:43.810
WHY
W

20:43.843 --> 20:45.912
COACH IS FINE.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.048
IS HE MAKING YOU
STAY HERE?

20:49.081 --> 20:50.550
NO ONE'S MAKING US
DO ANYTHING.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.818
WHAT YOU WANT --
BUSTING IN HERE LIKE THIS?

20:51.851 --> 20:53.486
DO YOUR PARENTS KNOW
WHERE THE HELL YOU ARE?

20:53.520 --> 20:55.054
Y'ALL GOT A WARRANT?

20:55.087 --> 20:57.824
GUYS, DON'T TALK TO THEM
ABOUT ANYTHING WITH COACH,

20:57.857 --> 20:58.825
ALL RIGHT? --
WITHOUT A LAWYER.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.427
WE NEED TO CALL DCFS.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.363
THESE BOYS NEED A PHYSICAL EXAM
BY A DOCTOR, PRONTO.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.931
GABRIEL, CALL TAYLOR.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.934
TELL HIM TO LET CHIEF KNOW
WHAT WE GOT HAPPENING HERE.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.870
FLYNN, KEEP YOUR EYES
ON THESE KIDS.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.505
WE'RE GONNA GO OUT HERE

21:12.539 --> 21:15.308
AND KEEP LOOKING FOR
WHAT WE CAME HERE TO FIND.

21:15.342 --> 21:18.378
TROPHIES --
TROPHIES, LIEUTENANT.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.947
YES,
FULLY LOADED TROPHIES.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.350
YEAH.
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GUESS

21:23.383 --> 21:26.553
WHAT'S GOING ON IN COACH CARR'S
HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

21:26.586 --> 21:29.422
THESE KIDS ARE NOT HIS OWN,
THEY'RE NOT RELATED TO HIM,

21:29.456 --> 21:31.958
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST HANGING OUT
AT HIS HOUSE, CHIEF.

21:31.991 --> 21:35.595
THEY'RE LIVING THERE,
EACH WITH HIS OWN BED.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.731
I CAN'T DECIDE
IF THIS GUY'S A KILLER,

21:38.765 --> 21:40.333
A MONSTER OF SOME KIND,

21:40.367 --> 21:41.734
OR JUST OVERLY COMMITTED
TO HIS JOB.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.336
WHY CAN'T HE BE ALL THREE?

21:43.370 --> 21:45.772
I'M JUST SAYING, CHIEF,

21:45.805 --> 21:48.375
ONE OF THE WAYS
A SERIAL OFFENDER

21:48.408 --> 21:50.076
MANAGES TO AVOID DETECTION

21:50.109 --> 21:52.912
IS BY BEING ATTRACTIVE
TO HIS VICTIMS.

21:52.945 --> 21:55.382
COACH CARR SEEMS TO BE
PROVIDING THESE BOYS

21:55.415 --> 21:56.983
WITH THE NECESSITIES
OF LIFE.

21:57.016 --> 22:00.820
AND WHEN A KID THINKS HIS
SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON SOMEONE...

22:00.853 --> 22:02.955
HAVE THEY FOUND
THE MURDER WEAPON?

22:02.989 --> 22:03.856
NOT YET.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.492
I NEED IT.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.027
OKAY. WELL, THEY'RE SEARCHING
THE SUSPECT'S HOME,

22:08.060 --> 22:09.429
BUT CAPTAIN RAYDOR --

22:09.462 --> 22:10.997
SHE HAS TO BE
EXTRA CAREFUL

22:11.030 --> 22:13.500
ABOUT HOW SHE GOES ABOUT
DOING THAT,

22:13.533 --> 22:15.034
BECAUSE IF THERE'S A LEAK
IN YOUR DIVISION --

22:15.067 --> 22:16.636
BUT THERE'S NO LEAK.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.705
YEAH, YEAH.
SO YOU KEEP SAYING.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.140
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO PUT
CAPTAIN RAYDOR ON THE SPOT.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.942
I KNOW SHE'S PROTECTING
MY FLANK.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.044
BUT...I NEED TO TAKE THIS GUY
TO A DARK PLACE,

22:25.077 --> 22:27.046
AND I DON'T WANT TO GO THERE
WITHOUT A GUN.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.684
I GET IT, CHIEF.

22:32.885 --> 22:34.554
I GET IT.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.990
THANK YOU, OFFICER.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.727
THIS IS WHAT I GET
BECAUSE I'VE PUT THE KIDS FIRST?

22:40.760 --> 22:43.496
ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE,
I PUT THEM FIRST.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.965
AND REED PUT HIMSELF FIRST
AND HIS CAREER.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.900
YOU PUT THE KIDS FIRST?
ALWAYS.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.636
DID YOU ALSO PUT THEM
IN YOUR HOUSE?

22:49.669 --> 22:51.170
MY HOUSE?

22:51.203 --> 22:53.473
MY DETECTIVES JUST FOUND
THREE UNDERAGE BOYS

22:53.506 --> 22:55.007
LIVING AT YOUR HOUSE,
HALF NAKED.

22:55.041 --> 22:59.412
PRINCIPAL REED KNEW ABOUT THEM,
DIDN'T HE?

22:59.446 --> 23:00.747
THAT'S WHAT HE THREATENED

23:00.780 --> 23:02.114
TO TELL THE SCHOOL DISTRICT
LAST NIGHT,

23:02.148 --> 23:04.584
WHEN YOU TWO ARGUED.
ALL RIGHT, NOW, LISTEN.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.453
F-FIRST, OKAY,
YOU NEED TO --

23:06.486 --> 23:09.689
YOU NEED TO GET THOSE DETECTIVES
OUT OF MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW,

23:09.722 --> 23:10.823
AND THEN --

23:10.857 --> 23:12.525
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I NEED TO DO!

23:12.559 --> 23:13.926
I NEED TO QUESTION
THOSE BOYS

23:13.960 --> 23:15.828
AND FIND OUT IF THE CARE
YOU GAVE THEM

23:15.862 --> 23:17.630
EXTENDED TO SOME KIND
OF PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.532
LOOK, LOOK, LISTEN,
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT

23:19.566 --> 23:21.468
TO MAKE ACCUSATIONS
LIKE THAT!
I HAVE EVERY RIGHT, SIR!

23:21.501 --> 23:24.170
UNLESS YOU CAN PRODUCE DOCUMENTS
SHOWING ME

23:24.203 --> 23:25.204
THAT YOU ARE THE LEGAL GUARDIAN
OF THOSE BOYS...
I MEAN, MY GOD, TO SAY SOMETHING
LIKE THAT OUT LOUD...

23:25.237 --> 23:26.773
THIS HAS GONE TOO FAR,
OKAY?

23:26.806 --> 23:28.608
GIVE ME THOSE DOCUMENTS, SIR,
AND THEN --

23:28.641 --> 23:29.676
THIS HAS GONE TOO FAR!
WHEN I TALK
TO THOSE PARENTS --

23:29.709 --> 23:31.844
THEIR PARENTS?!

23:31.878 --> 23:32.845
YOU WANT TO TALK
TO THEIR PARENTS?!

23:32.879 --> 23:33.946
DO YOU HAVE PERMISSION?!

23:33.980 --> 23:36.949
PERMISSION?!
ARE YOU SERIOUS?!

23:36.983 --> 23:39.218
NO, I DON'T HAVE
PERMISSION, OKAY?

23:39.251 --> 23:42.021
I HAVEN'T EXACTLY FOLLOWED
THE RULES HERE,

23:42.054 --> 23:43.990
BUT DO YOU KNOW
WHERE THESE BOYS WERE LIVING

23:44.023 --> 23:45.792
BEFORE THEY CAME
TO STAY WITH ME?

23:45.825 --> 23:47.960
ONE OF THEM WAS HOMELESS,

23:47.994 --> 23:50.162
SLEEPING IN OUR LOCKER ROOM
FOR TWO WEEKS.

23:50.196 --> 23:52.865
ONE WAS BEATEN SO BADLY
BY HIS DRUNK OF A STEPFATHER,

23:52.899 --> 23:54.734
I HAD TO TAKE HIM
TO THE HOSPITAL.

23:54.767 --> 23:58.004
SO YOU PREY
ON THROWAWAY KIDS --

23:58.037 --> 23:59.539
IS THAT RIGHT?

24:03.510 --> 24:04.777
OKAY.

24:04.811 --> 24:07.580
FIVE YEARS AGO,

24:07.614 --> 24:09.148
THE SINGLE MOM
OF ONE OF MY STUDENTS

24:09.181 --> 24:11.884
WENT TO JAIL
FOR DEALING DRUGS.

24:11.918 --> 24:15.021
AND I DID NOTHING
FOR THE BOY.

24:15.054 --> 24:18.190
TWO DAYS LATER,
HE WAS SHOT TO DEATH --

24:18.224 --> 24:20.660
MURDER, UNSOLVED.

24:20.693 --> 24:24.931
AND WHO TOOK RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THAT

24:26.566 --> 24:29.235
PUT ME IN FRONT
OF A JURY.

24:29.268 --> 24:31.704
I WOULD LOVE
NOTHING BETTER

24:31.738 --> 24:34.574
THAN TO PUBLICIZE WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH THESE CHILDREN.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.612
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA FIND?

24:39.646 --> 24:40.747
Gabriel: NOTHING.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.549
THIS PLACE IS CLEAN.

24:42.582 --> 24:45.084
WE'VE SEARCHED EVERY ROOM
IN THIS HOUSE, TOP TO BOTTOM.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.619
THERE IS NO FIREARM HERE.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.521
TROPHY.

24:48.555 --> 24:52.191
GENTLEMEN, WE ARE LOOKING
FOR STOLEN TROPHIES.

24:52.224 --> 24:55.928
FINDING A GUN
WOULD BE INCIDENTAL.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.930
LIEUTENANT,
IF YOU STOLE A TROPHY,

24:57.964 --> 25:00.099
WOULD YOU MAYBE BURY IT
IN YOUR BACKYARD?

25:00.132 --> 25:02.034
SOMEONE'S PLANTED SHRUBS.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.704
MAYBE THEY BURIED
A TROPHY, TOO.

25:04.737 --> 25:07.607
AH. WELL, CAPTAIN,

25:07.640 --> 25:09.876
IS IT PROCEDURE?

25:09.909 --> 25:11.243
WELL, WHO AM I TO SAY

25:11.277 --> 25:14.113
WHAT SOMEONE WOULD DO
WITH A STOLEN TROPHY,

25:14.146 --> 25:16.749
BUT IF I WERE GONNA LOOK
FOR ONE IN A BACKYARD,

25:16.783 --> 25:18.184
I'D USE
A METAL DETECTOR.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.085
EXCUSE ME.

25:23.823 --> 25:26.826
Raydor: REMEMBER, CONCENTRATE
ON STRETCHES OF GROUND

25:26.859 --> 25:29.662
LARGE ENOUGH TO COVER
A TROPHY-SIZED OBJECT.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.097
HEY, HEY.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.565
THERE'S A LITTLE
SOMETHING DOWN HERE

25:32.599 --> 25:33.666
AT THE END
OF THIS RUNNER.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.868
THAT'S TOO SMALL
FOR A TROPHY,

25:35.902 --> 25:37.870
WHICH IS WHAT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.338
AND IF WE FIND
SOMETHING ELSE,

25:39.371 --> 25:41.140
THEN WE CALL IT
A HAPPY ACCIDENT.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.943
AH. SO...

25:43.976 --> 25:45.712
APROPOS OF
NOTHING REALLY,

25:45.745 --> 25:49.315
WHEN CAN MAJOR CRIMES START
PLANNING YOUR RETIREMENT PARTY?

25:49.348 --> 25:54.320
I WANT TO BRING
THE BALLOON ANIMALS MYSELF.

25:54.353 --> 25:57.356
WHO TOLD YOU I WAS RETIRING,
LIEUTENANT?

25:57.389 --> 26:00.359
WELL, YOU SAID IT IN FRONT
OF TAYLOR, DIDN'T YOU?

26:03.095 --> 26:04.997
WE FOUND SOMETHING.
REALLY, BUZZ?

26:05.031 --> 26:07.133
WE'LL MAKE
A DETECTIVE OUT OF YOU YET.

26:07.166 --> 26:10.102
GIVE IT A GO, JULIO.

26:28.120 --> 26:31.891
FIRST, YOU THREATEN YOUR BOSS,
WHO ENDS UP MURDERED.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.293
THEN WE FIND THREE
HALF-NAKED UNDERAGE BOYS

26:34.326 --> 26:35.662
LIVING IN YOUR HOUSE.

26:35.695 --> 26:39.098
AND HERE...
IS THE MURDER WEAPON,

26:39.131 --> 26:41.000
FOUND BURIED
IN YOUR BACKYARD,

26:41.033 --> 26:44.036
THE ONE USED TO KILL
PRINCIPAL REED.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.639
SO YOU HAVE MOTIVE, THE MEANS,
AND THE OPPORTUNITY.

26:46.673 --> 26:49.141
NOW, MR. CARR, I WOULD BE LYING
IF I SAID ANYTHING

26:49.175 --> 26:51.778
OTHER THAN "YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

26:51.811 --> 26:54.313
"ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU

26:54.346 --> 26:55.782
"IN A COURT OF LAW.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.316
"YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.251
"IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD
AN ATTORNEY,

26:59.285 --> 27:01.688
ONE WILL BE PROVIDED FOR YOU
BY THE STATE."

27:01.721 --> 27:05.858
NOW...I WANT YOU
TO THINK REALLY, REALLY HARD

27:05.892 --> 27:08.127
ABOUT EVERYTHING
YOU'VE TOLD ME.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.863
DOES IT MAKE YOU
SOUND INNOCENT?

27:10.897 --> 27:14.033
BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T,

27:14.066 --> 27:18.437
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO START OVER?

27:18.470 --> 27:23.075
BECAUSE I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, DON'T WE?

27:23.109 --> 27:27.079
AS HARD AS IT IS TO SAY,

27:27.113 --> 27:29.115
DON'T WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:32.752 --> 27:34.687
I WANT A LAWYER.

27:39.158 --> 27:42.128
Brenda:
ARE YOU SURE, LIEUTENANT?

27:42.161 --> 27:45.264
UH, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.199
THANK YOU.

27:47.233 --> 27:48.267
HEY, GOOD MORNING.

27:49.435 --> 27:51.037
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

27:51.070 --> 27:52.872
YEAH.

27:52.905 --> 27:55.141
WELL, THE THREE BOYS
LIVING WITH COACH CARR

27:55.174 --> 27:57.443
HAD THEIR PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS
THIS MORNING

27:57.476 --> 27:59.045
AND MET WITH A COUNSELOR.

27:59.078 --> 28:01.781
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ABUSE,
SEXUAL OR OTHERWISE.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.349
WELL, THAT'S A RELIEF,
ISN'T IT?

28:03.382 --> 28:05.284
YES, YES.
OF COURSE.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.386
BUT NOW COACH CARR'S
ONLY MOTIVE

28:07.419 --> 28:10.122
WOULD SEEM TO BE
AVOIDING A JOB TRANSFER,

28:10.156 --> 28:11.791
AND HE HAS ENOUGH TIME IN

28:11.824 --> 28:14.493
TO RETIRE WITH HIS WHOLE PENSION
IF HE WANTED.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.862
KIND OF LIKE RAYDOR, HUH?

28:15.895 --> 28:18.264
LIKE RAYDOR HOW?

28:18.297 --> 28:20.032
WHAT --
DIDN'T SHE TELL YOU?

28:20.066 --> 28:22.168
TELL ME WHAT?

28:24.203 --> 28:26.172
WELL, APPARENTLY,

28:26.205 --> 28:29.341
RAYDOR THINKS
SHE SHOULD RETIRE.

28:30.810 --> 28:35.081
SHE HATES CHECKING UP ON YOU
ALL THE TIME,

28:35.114 --> 28:36.816
FEELS SHE'S NOT WANTED,

28:36.849 --> 28:38.250
AND SUPPOSEDLY
HAS A GREAT JOB OFFER.

28:38.284 --> 28:40.386
OH.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.154
WHAT?

28:42.188 --> 28:44.056
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPY
TO HAVE HER OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.125
YEAH, BUT SHE HASN'T FOUND
THE LEAK YET.

28:46.158 --> 28:47.526
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
THERE IS A LEAK.

28:47.559 --> 28:51.030
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I'M...RIGHT.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.999
AMAZING.

28:53.032 --> 28:55.034
ONE THING YOU WERE
RIGHT ABOUT, THOUGH --

28:55.067 --> 28:59.038
EVEN THOUGH THE GUN YOU FOUND
IN YOUR SUSPECT'S BACKYARD

28:59.071 --> 29:01.073
MATCHES UP WITH THE CASINGS
IN BOTH OUR CASES,

29:01.107 --> 29:04.343
THERE'S NO GOOD REASON
COACH CARR WOULD WANT
MY TSA AGENT DEAD.

29:04.376 --> 29:06.946
SO, AS FAR AS
THE FBI IS CONCERNED,

29:06.979 --> 29:09.916
THIS CASE BELONGS TO YOU.

29:09.949 --> 29:11.117
WELL, THANK YOU.
THAT'S GREAT.

29:11.150 --> 29:12.819
ONE LAST QUESTION --

29:12.852 --> 29:14.854
HAVE YOU COME ACROSS ANYONE
IN YOUR INVESTIGATION

29:14.887 --> 29:16.255
BY THE NAME
OF TERRENCE MILLER?

29:16.288 --> 29:18.024
NO. WHY?

29:18.057 --> 29:19.425
HMM.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.093
BECAUSE THE GUN YOU FOUND
IN CARR'S BACKYARD

29:21.127 --> 29:22.161
IS REGISTERED IN HIS NAME.

29:22.194 --> 29:24.096
UH, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

29:24.130 --> 29:27.166
WHERE THIS TERRENCE MILLER
MIGHT BE?

29:28.367 --> 29:31.470
HE'S IN INTERVIEW 1
WITH GABRIEL.

29:31.503 --> 29:34.040
MILLER DID FIVE YEARS
FOR ROBBING A LIQUOR STORE

29:34.073 --> 29:36.375
WITH THE SAME GUN
USED TO KILL PRINCIPAL REED.

29:36.408 --> 29:39.245
THE GUN WAS NEVER RECOVERED,
BUT HE PLED GUILTY --

29:39.278 --> 29:42.381
SERVED ALL OF HIS TIME,
SO HE'S PROBABLY A HARD-ASS.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.550
DO WE KNOW HIS WHEREABOUTS
DURING THE TIME OF THE MURDER?

29:44.583 --> 29:47.219
WORKING. GUY'S A VALET
FOR A RESTAURANT DOWNTOWN.

29:47.253 --> 29:48.855
HIS SUPERVISOR
VOUCHES FOR HIM.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.422
ANY CONNECTION
TO COACH CARR?

29:50.456 --> 29:52.158
COULDN'T FIND ANY.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.425
ALSO, HE LIVES COMPLETELY
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF L.A.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.494
FROM REED AND CARR,

29:55.527 --> 29:57.329
SO IT'S NOT LIKELY
HE WAS GONNA RUN INTO
THEM AT A BLOCK PARTY.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.531
WE'VE CROSS-REFERENCED
EVERY DATABASE WE CAN THINK OF

29:59.565 --> 30:01.600
TO SEE HOW ELSE MILLER AND REED
COULD HAVE MET --

30:01.633 --> 30:04.470
TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS,
CRIME REPORTS,

30:04.503 --> 30:06.105
FACEBOOK -- NOTHING.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.107
ALL RIGHT, THEN,
WE'LL JUST SEE

30:08.140 --> 30:10.142
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY
ABOUT HIS GUN.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.617
CHIEF JOHNSON,
I'VE JUST HEARD

30:18.650 --> 30:22.221
THAT THE THREE BOYS FROM COACH
CARR'S HOUSE ARE STILL HERE.

30:22.254 --> 30:24.123
THAT'S CORRECT.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.192
TECHNICALLY, WE'RE REQUIRED TO
RELEASE THEM TO THEIR PARENTS.

30:26.225 --> 30:27.994
WELL, SO FAR,
WE'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO FIND

30:28.027 --> 30:29.428
ONE OF THE MOTHERS,

30:29.461 --> 30:30.496
AND SHE SAYS SHE'S TOO BUSY
TO COME DOWN HERE

30:30.529 --> 30:31.931
UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING.

30:31.964 --> 30:34.566
YOU WANT ME
TO LET THESE BOYS GO?

30:34.600 --> 30:37.236
WHAT IF THEY GET LOST OR HURT
OR INVOLVED IN A CRIME?

30:37.269 --> 30:39.906
GOLDMAN CAN END UP
RECRUITING THEIR PARENTS

30:39.939 --> 30:42.374
FOR THAT FEDERAL LAWSUIT
OF HIS.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.610
OR DON'T YOU CARE
ABOUT THAT ANYMORE?

30:44.643 --> 30:48.414
WHERE ARE THE BOYS
RIGHT NOW, CHIEF?

30:48.447 --> 30:49.648
IN THE BREAK ROOM.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.084
I FIGURED, SINCE WE COULDN'T
RELEASE THEM,

30:52.118 --> 30:53.920
WE MIGHT AS WELL
FEED THEM.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.421
LET ME SEE
IF I CAN GET THE BOYS

30:55.454 --> 30:57.189
TO HELP US LOCATE
THEIR RELATIVES.

30:57.223 --> 30:58.124
PARDON ME.

31:02.261 --> 31:04.596
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
SHE WAS RETIRING?

31:04.630 --> 31:07.233
BECAUSE I'M TALKING HER
OUT OF IT.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.634
IF YOU COULD SAY SOMETHING
ENCOURAGING,

31:08.667 --> 31:10.369
THAT WOULD BE
EXTREMELY HELPFUL --

31:10.402 --> 31:13.005
UNLESS YOU'D LIKE ME TO REPLACE
HER WITH SOMEONE WORSE.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.512
I KNOW YOU HADN'T PLANNED
ON BEING HERE THIS MORNING,

31:20.546 --> 31:22.181
AND WE APPRECIATE
YOU JOINING US,

31:22.214 --> 31:24.283
HELPING US SOLVE
OUR LITTLE PROBLEM.

31:24.316 --> 31:25.985
I ALREADY TOLD THE OLD GUY
I DIDN'T DO NOTHING.

31:26.018 --> 31:29.021
I'VE BEEN CLEAN. I'VE BEEN
STAYING OUT OF TROUBLE.

31:29.055 --> 31:31.257
RELAX, FLYNN. YOU'RE MUCH, MUCH
YOUNGER THAN YOU LOOK.

31:32.524 --> 31:35.962
DOES THIS LOOK FAMILIAR
TO YOU, SIR?

31:35.995 --> 31:38.197
I AIN'T NEVER SEEN
THAT GUN.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.232
I FIND THAT
HARD TO BELIEVE.

31:40.266 --> 31:42.268
THE GUN IS REGISTERED
IN YOUR NAME,

31:42.301 --> 31:44.403
AND THE CASINGS MATCH
THOSE LEFT BEHIND

31:44.436 --> 31:46.005
AT A ROBBERY YOU PULLED.

31:46.038 --> 31:49.008
MAN...YOU GUYS,

31:49.041 --> 31:51.310
ALWAYS JERKING
PEOPLE AROUND.

31:51.343 --> 31:54.046
WHERE YOU GOT THAT GUN --
I DON'T KNOW, AND I DON'T CARE.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.447
I DONE MY TIME
FOR THAT ROBBERY.

31:55.481 --> 31:57.116
YOU CAN'T PLAY ME
A DOUBLE JEOPARDY.

31:57.149 --> 31:58.584
THIS IS YOUR WEAPON,
CORRECT?

31:58.617 --> 32:00.486
I AIN'T SEEN IT SINCE BEFORE
I WANT TO THE JOINT --

32:00.519 --> 32:01.954
DITCHED IT BEFORE
I WAS ARRESTED --

32:01.988 --> 32:03.089
WHERE DID YOU DITCH IT?

32:04.690 --> 32:07.293
I WAS STAYING WITH SOME BITCH
AND HER KIDS,

32:07.326 --> 32:08.594
BEFORE I WENT TO JAIL.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.529
I HID THE GUN
AT HER PLACE, MAN.

32:10.562 --> 32:13.265
WHAT WAS HER NAME,
AND WHERE DID SHE LIVE?

32:13.299 --> 32:14.967
COME ON, MAN.
I DON'T KNOW.

32:15.001 --> 32:16.368
YOU DON'T KNOW THE NAME
OF THE WOMAN

32:16.402 --> 32:17.403
YOU WERE LIVING WITH
WHEN YOU WERE ARRESTED?

32:17.436 --> 32:18.971
WE WEREN'T MARRIED!

32:19.005 --> 32:20.539
SHE WAS, LIKE, SOMEONE
I HOOKED UP WITH FOR A BIT,

32:20.572 --> 32:21.640
A STRIPPER.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.142
HAD LIKE SIX NAMES
SHE WENT BY.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.277
DID SHE LIVE AT SIX
DIFFERENT PLACES, TOO?

32:25.311 --> 32:27.113
I DON'T KNOW. LOOK,
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN YEARS.

32:27.146 --> 32:28.580
WHAT DO YOU CARE
ABOUT WHERE SHE LIVED?

32:28.614 --> 32:30.349
ANSWER THE QUESTION.
WHAT?

32:30.382 --> 32:32.618
I SAID,
ANSWER THE QUESTION!

32:33.519 --> 32:35.754
THIS GUN WAS USED IN A MURDER
TWO NIGHTS AGO.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.623
A MAN WAS KILLED
WITH THIS WEAPON.

32:37.656 --> 32:40.092
NOW, YOU WILL TELL ME
WHERE YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND LIVED

32:40.126 --> 32:42.128
AND WHAT HER NAME IS,

32:42.161 --> 32:43.662
OR I'M GOING TO ARREST YOU
FOR MURDER.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.631
I HAVE AN ALIBI --
MY BOSS.

32:45.664 --> 32:48.667
WHO DO YOU THINK
THE JURY'S GONNA BELIEVE --

32:48.700 --> 32:50.002
YOUR BOSS OR ME?

32:51.103 --> 32:53.439
I DON'T REMEMBER
WHERE THE BITCH LIVED!

32:53.472 --> 32:55.307
I DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HER NAME
NO MORE, I SWEAR!

32:57.776 --> 33:00.612
SHE ONLY EVER WANTED ME
FOR A BABYSITTER, ANYWAY.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.081
SHE WAS USING ME, MAN.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.215
YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME.

33:03.249 --> 33:05.284
PLEASE, I NEED THIS JOB.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.586
I CAN'T LOSE THIS JOB!
PLEASE.

33:07.619 --> 33:11.457
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
COME WITH ME, THIS WAY.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.259
YOU'RE ARRESTING ME?

33:13.292 --> 33:14.526
DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT
YOU HELP ME.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.028
GET UP!

33:17.063 --> 33:19.631
THIS WAY.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.267
COME ON, GUYS.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.169
LET'S, UH, WANDER DOWN
TO THE BREAK ROOM, HUH?

33:27.439 --> 33:29.475
AND JUST SO WE CAN BE SURE
THAT WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING

33:29.508 --> 33:31.377
TO CONTACT
YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS,

33:31.410 --> 33:34.613
COULD EACH OF YOU WRITE DOWN
THE NAMES

33:34.646 --> 33:36.582
OF ALL YOUR LIVING
GRANDPARENTS?

33:40.186 --> 33:41.387
HEY.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.489
SORRY IT TOOK ME SO LONG
TO GET DOWN HERE.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.624
UH...

33:45.657 --> 33:48.294
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

33:48.327 --> 33:50.696
SUPPOSED TO...PICK YOU UP.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.539
I THOUGHT YOU WAS IN JAIL.

34:01.773 --> 34:03.509
LEWIS...

34:03.542 --> 34:06.478
WOULD YOU COME WITH ME, PLEASE?
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

34:12.818 --> 34:14.420
LEWIS!

34:19.191 --> 34:20.559
Gabriel: HEY!

34:24.230 --> 34:25.564
LEWIS!

34:29.735 --> 34:31.470
LEWIS,
YOU'RE IN A POLICE STATION.

34:31.503 --> 34:34.240
RUNNING IS NOT GONNA DO YOU
OR COACH CARR A LICK OF GOOD.

34:34.273 --> 34:35.807
HEY, DON'T TALK
ABOUT COACH CARR.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.643
YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT COACH.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.845
I KNOW A MAN WHO ARGUED WITH HIM
ENDED UP SHOT TO DEATH.

34:39.878 --> 34:41.647
I KNOW
THAT THE MURDER WEAPON

34:41.680 --> 34:43.149
WAS FOUND
IN YOUR COACH'S BACKYARD.

34:43.182 --> 34:44.550
THAT'S ENOUGH TO PUT HIM AWAY
FOR MURDER.

34:44.583 --> 34:45.884
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT US
TO DO --

34:45.917 --> 34:47.519
YOU WANT TO US TO PUT YOUR COACH
AWAY FOR MURDER?

34:47.553 --> 34:50.389
HE WAS TRYING TO HELP YOU,
WASN'T HE, LEWIS?

34:50.422 --> 34:51.590
HE WAS LOOKING OUT
FOR YOU.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.725
TILL PRINCIPAL REED
CAME ALONG.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.695
HE'S THE GUY
THAT RUINED EVERYTHING.

34:56.728 --> 35:00.866
NOT ME --
I HAD NO CHOICE.

35:00.899 --> 35:02.201
NO CHOICE BUT WHAT?

35:02.234 --> 35:04.636
WHERE WAS I
SUPPOSED TO GO?

35:04.670 --> 35:06.638
WHERE WILL ANYONE GO
WHEN COACH CARR IS GONE?

35:06.672 --> 35:08.774
COACH WON'T BE GONE.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.909
OH, YES, HE WILL BE,
LEWIS.

35:10.942 --> 35:15.147
I'M ARRESTING HIM FOR MURDERING
PRINCIPAL REED...

35:15.181 --> 35:16.915
UNLESS YOU CAN TELL ME
WHO ELSE MIGHT HAVE DONE IT.

35:16.948 --> 35:20.219
WAS IT YOU, LEWIS?

35:20.252 --> 35:22.321
DID YOU HOLD ONTO THE GUN
THAT MR. MILLER

35:22.354 --> 35:25.324
LEFT AT YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE
AND GIVE IT TO COACH CARR

35:25.357 --> 35:26.558
SO THAT HE COULD MURDER
PRINCIPAL REED?

35:26.592 --> 35:28.560
NO! NO!

35:28.594 --> 35:30.729
COACH DIDN'T DO IT.

35:31.763 --> 35:35.167
I SHOT THE BASTARD.

35:35.201 --> 35:37.503
NOT SURE I BELIEVE THAT.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.238
I JUST TOLD YOU I DID IT.
WHAT YOU MEAN?

35:39.271 --> 35:40.506
Flynn: THIS MURDER
TOOK PLANNING, KID.

35:40.539 --> 35:41.740
I CAN PLAN, SIR.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.342
I FIGURED OUT
HOW PRINCIPAL REED

35:43.375 --> 35:45.477
WENT HOME FROM SCHOOL
EVERY NIGHT, DIDN'T I?

35:45.511 --> 35:46.678
I FIGURED OUT
WHERE TO WAIT FOR HIM.

35:46.712 --> 35:47.879
YOU ALMOST SHOT
THE WRONG GUY.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.681
ALMOST DON'T COUNT, LADY.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.317
AND I DIDN'T GIVE UP.

35:51.350 --> 35:54.853
I KEPT MY EYE --
MY EYE RIGHT THERE ON THE BALL.

35:54.886 --> 35:57.656
I MADE SURE MR. REED
KNEW ME REAL GOOD.

35:57.689 --> 36:00.592
I WAS ALWAYS SMILING AT HIM
IN THE HALLS,

36:00.626 --> 36:03.229
GOING UP TO HIM,
CALLING HIM, "SIR."

36:03.262 --> 36:05.764
YEAH,
I CALLED HIM "SIR" A LOT.

36:08.334 --> 36:11.603
SO, LIKE, WHEN I WALKED UP
TO HIS CAR AT THE STOP SIGN,

36:11.637 --> 36:12.604
HE KNEW ME.

36:12.638 --> 36:15.541
HE ROLLED DOWN THE WINDOW.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.943
AND I LET HIM HAVE IT.

36:17.976 --> 36:20.246
POW, POW, POW, POW, POW!

36:20.279 --> 36:21.313
POW.

36:23.582 --> 36:24.716
YEAH.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.418
AND NOW YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

36:26.452 --> 36:29.488
AND I AIN'T SORRY ABOUT IT.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.358
NO, I AIN'T SORRY
ABOUT NONE OF IT.

36:32.391 --> 36:35.894
AND YOU GUYS -- YOU GUYS
CAN'T EVEN DO NOTHING TO ME.

36:35.927 --> 36:38.930
I'M A MINOR.
I'M ONLY 15.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.934
WE'LL SEE IF THE D.A.
HAS SOMETHING TO SAY

36:42.968 --> 36:45.737
ABOUT YOUR BEING TRIED
AS AN ADULT.

36:46.672 --> 36:48.374
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,
WOULD YOU SEE TO IT

36:48.407 --> 36:49.775
THAT LEWIS GETS
TO BOOKING, PLEASE?

36:49.808 --> 36:52.544
I TOOK A HIT FOR MY TEAM,
YOU KNOW?

36:52.578 --> 36:53.812
SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO DO THAT,

36:53.845 --> 36:55.647
EVEN IF YOU GET PULLED
FROM THE GAME.

36:55.681 --> 36:58.884
THAT'S ALL I DID. TOOK A HIT
FOR MY TEAM -- MY TEAM.

36:58.917 --> 37:01.420
I SAVED 'EM.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.470
Taylor: YOU MAY FEEL BAD
ABOUT COACH CARR,

37:18.504 --> 37:19.571
BUT YOU HAD NO CHOICE.

37:19.605 --> 37:20.706
HE LAWYERED UP.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.608
I KNOW.
HE WAS TRYING TO PROTECT

37:22.641 --> 37:24.443
THE BOYS LIVING
IN HIS HOUSE.

37:24.476 --> 37:26.578
YEAH. HARD TO KNOW WHAT ELSE
YOU COULD HAVE DONE.

37:34.786 --> 37:38.557
COACH CARR, I JUST -- I JUST
WANT TO, UM, SAY I'M SORRY

37:38.590 --> 37:42.027
FOR ANY...MISUNDERSTANDINGS
THAT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED

37:42.060 --> 37:44.062
DURING THIS
INVESTIGATION.

37:44.095 --> 37:47.766
WELL, IT'S, UH, LEWIS YOU SHOULD
FEEL SORRY FOR. NOT ME.

37:47.799 --> 37:48.967
HE'S A GOOD KID --

37:49.000 --> 37:50.969
HE'S SMART...

37:51.002 --> 37:53.071
NEVER HAD A PROPER CHANCE,
AND NOW HE NEVER WILL.

37:53.104 --> 37:56.007
LOTS OF PEOPLE LACK
PROPER CHANCES, COACH.

37:56.041 --> 37:57.876
LOTS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE.

37:57.909 --> 37:58.977
AND VERY FEW
OF THEM DECIDE

37:59.010 --> 38:00.579
THAT MURDER'S
THE NEXT BEST THING.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.682
WOW.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.451
WOW, YOU GUYS SEEM
REALLY WELL-INFORMED

38:05.484 --> 38:07.386
ABOUT THE KIND OF WORLD
THAT MY STUDENTS LIVE IN.

38:07.419 --> 38:09.688
HEY. THOSE OTHER KIDS
AT MY HOUSE --

38:09.721 --> 38:11.790
DID THEIR PARENTS
EVER SHOW UP,

38:11.823 --> 38:14.626
OR ARE YOU GONNA BE
TURNING THOSE BOYS OVER

38:14.660 --> 38:17.396
TO THE DEPARTMENT
OF CHILDREN'S SERVICES?

38:19.465 --> 38:20.966
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER
EITHER WAY.

38:20.999 --> 38:23.402
THEY'LL BE ON THE STREET AGAIN
SOON ENOUGH,

38:23.435 --> 38:25.804
WHICH MEANS THEY'LL END UP
JOINING LEWIS IN JAIL

38:25.837 --> 38:26.938
OR REED IN THE MORGUE.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.340
YOU THINK THAT'S RIGHT?

38:30.108 --> 38:33.011
NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER.
I KNOW.

38:33.044 --> 38:36.014
I MEAN, I'M A CRIMINAL, TOO,
AREN'T I?

38:36.047 --> 38:38.984
GIVING ABANDONED JUVENILES

38:39.017 --> 38:42.521
A PLACE TO LIVE
WITHOUT THE PROPER PAPERWORK.

38:45.591 --> 38:47.826
TRYING TO SAVE
SOME OF THESE CHILDREN

38:47.859 --> 38:50.529
WE'RE NOT LEAVING BEHIND.

38:50.562 --> 38:53.064
BUT IT TURNS OUT
THAT'S YOUR JOB, ISN'T IT?

38:54.633 --> 38:56.334
YOU AND THE UNDERTAKERS.

39:09.080 --> 39:12.684
AS GOOD AS COACH CARR'S
INTENTIONS ARE,

39:12.718 --> 39:14.119
HIS ACTIONS WERE ILLEGAL.

39:14.152 --> 39:17.055
OR YOU COULD SAY THAT THE
CHALLENGES HE FACED AT WORK

39:17.088 --> 39:19.691
FORCED HIM TO LOOK
FOR UNORTHODOX SOLUTIONS.

39:19.725 --> 39:22.127
AND NOW, FOR GOING ABOVE
AND BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY,

39:22.160 --> 39:23.729
HE'LL PROBABLY LOSE
HIS JOB.

39:23.762 --> 39:25.964
OR MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR HIM
TO MOVE ON.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.033
I DON'T KNOW.

39:28.066 --> 39:30.135
HE SEEMED TO BE DOING
IMPORTANT WORK...

39:31.870 --> 39:36.041
...EVEN IF IT WASN'T
FULLY APPRECIATED BY HIS BOSS

39:36.074 --> 39:37.643
AND FELLOW TEACHERS.

39:37.676 --> 39:40.912
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
I FIND...ADMIRABLE.

39:42.614 --> 39:44.483
ME TOO.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.964
MM.

39:58.997 --> 40:02.701
SHARON RAYDOR...

40:02.734 --> 40:05.904
WHAT AN UNPLEASANT
SURPRISE.

40:05.937 --> 40:08.039
I'M GETTING REALLY USED
TO SEEING YOUR CAR

40:08.073 --> 40:10.208
PARKED IN FRONT OF SOMEPLACE
I NEED TO BE.

40:10.241 --> 40:13.078
I WAS JUST WARMING UP
COACH CARR FOR YOU.

40:13.111 --> 40:16.081
I CAN'T DECIDE WHICH OF US
HAS THE WORSE GIG HERE --

40:16.114 --> 40:17.949
YOU OR ME.

40:17.983 --> 40:19.951
WELL, THAT DEPENDS,
I GUESS,

40:19.985 --> 40:21.920
ON WHAT ONE WANTS
FROM LIFE.

40:21.953 --> 40:25.123
I GATHER YOU WANT A LITTLE MORE
THAN YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.959
AM I RIGHT?

40:27.993 --> 40:29.661
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

40:29.695 --> 40:33.164
JUST I HEAR YOU'RE GIVING UP
THE BADGE AND MOVING ON.

40:33.198 --> 40:35.066
REALLY?

40:35.100 --> 40:36.234
AND WHY NOT?

40:36.267 --> 40:37.769
YOU'VE EARNED
YOUR PENSION,

40:37.803 --> 40:39.638
RETIREMENT DOESN'T MEAN
AN END TO WORK,

40:39.671 --> 40:42.007
AND YOU'VE GOT A GREAT JOB OFFER
TO GO ALONG WITH IT.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.542
WHAT COULD BE BETTER?

40:43.575 --> 40:45.544
AND WHERE DID YOU
HEAR THAT?

40:45.577 --> 40:49.581
AH...LITTLE BIRDIE
TOLD ME.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.583
NO, REALLY, MR. GOLDMAN,
SERIOUSLY,

40:51.617 --> 40:53.985
FROM WHOM DID YOU HEAR
THAT I HAD A JOB OFFER

40:54.019 --> 40:55.854
AND THAT I WAS RETIRING?

40:55.887 --> 40:57.956
WHY?

40:57.989 --> 41:00.158
BECAUSE I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF RETIRING.

41:00.191 --> 41:02.761
A NEW JOB OFFER WAS
THE LAST THING ON MY MIND.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.596
THE ONLY THING
I'M TRYING TO DO

41:04.630 --> 41:07.032
IS PROVE THAT THERE REALLY IS
A LEAK IN THE L.A.P.D.

41:07.065 --> 41:09.167
AND THAT YOU ARE GETTING
YOUR INFORMATION

41:09.200 --> 41:13.071
QUICKER THAN SOME
OF THE OFFICERS.

41:13.104 --> 41:14.806
MAYBE I'LL HAVE
TO GET A WARRANT

41:14.840 --> 41:16.675
TO FIND OUT
WHO THE LITTLE BIRDIE IS.

41:16.708 --> 41:20.812
A WARRANT AGAINST THE ATTORNEY
WHO'S SUING YOU?

41:20.846 --> 41:23.815
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
