I missed my chance

02:53.380 --> 02:55.750
Isn't that thing kind of small
to be a kraken?

02:55.750 --> 02:57.670
Yeah. Looks like
a regular squid.

02:57.670 --> 02:58.580
Which is a kraken!

02:58.580 --> 02:59.750
Just a mini one.

-Mm.

Hiro: Guys, I know where
the bots are coming from.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.380
Back in my bot fighting days,
there was this guy named Stan

03:17.380 --> 03:20.500
who always marked his bots
with that same cartoon dog.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.580
Seems like a dumb thing to do
during a crime spree.

03:23.580 --> 03:25.210
Stan definitely built the bot.

03:25.210 --> 03:27.170
We need to see
if the stolen stuff is...

03:27.170 --> 03:29.330
-(police siren whoops)
-...in his shop.

03:29.330 --> 03:31.540
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

03:31.540 --> 03:33.920
Baymax: It appears
the police have come
to a similar conclusion.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.420
Come on, guys, I'm not a thief,
I'm a bot fighter!

03:36.420 --> 03:39.040
-There's no crime in that!
-Actually, there is.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.790
-Oh. That explains so much.
-(police radio chatter)

03:43.790 --> 03:46.500
I have a theory about
the robberies. Baymax?

03:46.500 --> 03:48.460
According to
the police reports,

03:48.460 --> 03:50.040
these suspects were arrested

03:50.040 --> 03:52.420
after their bots were caught
stealing on camera.

03:52.420 --> 03:54.620
But the police haven't found
any trace of the stolen cash,

03:54.620 --> 03:56.460
-which means...
-They already spent it.

03:56.460 --> 03:58.040
Or they wisely invested it.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.580
Or they didn't steal it?

03:59.580 --> 04:00.620
-Exactly!
-Yes!

04:00.620 --> 04:02.170
Look, I-I know these people.

04:02.170 --> 04:03.790
None of them could pull off
a crime spree.

04:03.790 --> 04:05.750
Okay. So then who could?

04:05.750 --> 04:07.290
Who do we know
in the bot-fighting world

04:07.290 --> 04:09.000
who could mastermind
a crime wave?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.920
Aunt Cass.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.790
Others:
Yama.

04:12.790 --> 04:14.830
Yama! So close.

04:15.670 --> 04:16.920
What do you think, Baymax?

04:16.920 --> 04:19.210
While possible,
there is no evidence

04:19.210 --> 04:20.880
to support this theory.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.540
Ooh, me! Me! I know exactly
how we can get evidence!

04:25.040 --> 04:27.920
Much like in the  Captain Fancy
Holiday Espionage Special,

04:27.920 --> 04:29.750
we need to go undercover
to find the evidence!

04:29.750 --> 04:31.620
We're not going undercover.

04:31.620 --> 04:33.000
Come on, Go Go,
I already got

04:33.000 --> 04:34.620
fake mustaches
for everyone.

04:34.620 --> 04:35.710
It's not a good idea.

04:35.710 --> 04:38.620
-Actually,
it's a great idea.
-Ha!

04:38.620 --> 04:40.880
I mean, it's mostly
a great idea.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.620
Just not the part
where we all go.

04:42.620 --> 04:44.830
You're right.
Baymax is pretty conspicuous.

04:44.830 --> 04:47.040
No, Fred. I have
to go in alone.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.790
I know that world.

04:48.790 --> 04:50.040
I'm the perfect spy.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.580
-(Go Go slurping)
-Hmm.

04:52.710 --> 04:54.830
What? I can handle this, guys.

04:54.830 --> 04:57.710
Yeah, but remember how Tadashi
did everything he could

04:57.710 --> 04:59.380
to pull you out
of the very dangerous,

04:59.380 --> 05:01.580
very illegal world
of bot fighting?

05:01.580 --> 05:04.330
I don't know, Hiro.
It might not be the best idea.

05:04.330 --> 05:05.920
-Stop it!
-I agree with everyone.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.580
Except for Go Go's harsh denial
of the mustache.

05:08.580 --> 05:10.750
I won't actually be fighting.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.290
I-I'll only be there long enough

05:12.290 --> 05:14.000
to find out what Yama's up to.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.330
It's our best shot.

05:16.830 --> 05:17.750
(yelps)

05:17.750 --> 05:18.750
Baymax:
But, Hiro--

05:18.750 --> 05:20.330
I'm sorry, Baymax.

05:20.330 --> 05:22.330
Yama's already
bot-napped you once.

05:22.330 --> 05:23.830
It's safer if you stay here.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.580
Besides, I'm not going
because I want to.

05:27.580 --> 05:29.710
I'm going because
it's the right thing to do.

05:29.710 --> 05:31.500
Baymax:
It is the right thing to do.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.380
But it is also illegal.
I do not understand.

05:34.380 --> 05:35.710
I'll explain later.

05:36.710 --> 05:37.670
Maybe.

05:39.830 --> 05:41.290
(dog barking in distance)

05:44.170 --> 05:45.750
(crowd murmuring)

05:49.670 --> 05:51.290
(chuckling)

05:51.290 --> 05:52.920
The guy put mayo
on my noodle burger

05:52.920 --> 05:53.790
after I said "no mayo."

05:53.790 --> 05:55.000
I had to hurt him.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.620
Man 2:
I like mayo.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.500
(crowd cheering)

06:03.880 --> 06:05.710
(hissing, chittering)

06:08.880 --> 06:09.790
(gasps)

06:09.790 --> 06:12.540
(crowd cheering)

06:12.540 --> 06:14.120
You've fought every night
this week,

06:14.120 --> 06:15.750
and you haven't made it past
the first round once!

06:17.880 --> 06:20.120
Take some advice
from a pro, Trina. Give up.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.670
You wish, Gus.

06:21.670 --> 06:23.290
I'm playing
the long game.

06:29.420 --> 06:30.750
Ketchup on your noodle burger,

06:30.750 --> 06:31.920
I can get behind that.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.830
Mustard? Relish? Great.

06:33.830 --> 06:34.920
Man 2:
Mayo!

06:36.330 --> 06:37.330
(gasps)

06:37.330 --> 06:38.460
Trina: Shh!

06:39.790 --> 06:40.620
Hmm? Hmmm.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.540
-Relax, would you?
-What're you doing?

06:43.540 --> 06:45.040
Saving you, obviously.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.120
I don't need saving.
But thanks.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.040
Why were you sneaking
into Yama's office, anyway?

06:51.040 --> 06:53.710
Last I checked,
you were blacklisted, Hamada.

06:53.710 --> 06:55.790
I'm sorry. Have we met?

06:55.790 --> 06:58.420
Any bot fighter worth
their circuits knows you.

06:58.420 --> 07:01.880
You were a legend.
Until you became a loser.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.120
A what? I never lost!

07:04.120 --> 07:05.750
Quitting is the same
as losing.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.620
Now get out of here
before Yama sees you!

07:07.620 --> 07:08.750
Uh, why do you care?

07:10.120 --> 07:11.380
-(yelps)
-I don't.

07:11.380 --> 07:12.790
But if you cause trouble,

07:12.790 --> 07:14.080
Yama might shut
the fights down,

07:14.080 --> 07:16.250
and I want to win.

07:16.250 --> 07:17.920
Yeah? No, me too.

07:17.920 --> 07:21.750
I'm actually un-retiring!

07:21.750 --> 07:23.290
-(grunts)
-Sure.

07:23.290 --> 07:25.920
That's why you're here
with no bot. My mistake.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.790
No, your mistake
was not shielding
your memory unit properly.

07:28.790 --> 07:30.460
What's that supposed to mean?

07:30.460 --> 07:33.040
Nothing. I mean,
I'm the loser, right?

07:33.040 --> 07:34.500
Who cares what I think?

07:34.500 --> 07:36.120
(crowd cheering)

07:36.120 --> 07:37.750
See? Those numbers mean

07:37.750 --> 07:39.750
your power source
is outputting a B field

07:39.750 --> 07:41.250
that's corrupting
your stored data.

07:41.250 --> 07:43.040
Huh? Looks like you're right.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.500
Gotta beef up the shielding.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.170
You could do that.

07:46.170 --> 07:49.500
Or, you could focus
the extra B field and use it.

07:51.210 --> 07:52.920
-(crowd cheering)
-(laughing)

07:52.920 --> 07:55.500
Maybe you're not
a total loser.

08:02.170 --> 08:04.250
-What?
-What do you mean, "What?"

08:04.250 --> 08:05.830
-How did it go last night?
-Talk.

08:05.830 --> 08:08.080
Was being a spy everything
I dreamed it would be?

08:08.080 --> 08:09.580
Did someone ask
for a password?

08:09.580 --> 08:10.880
Ooh! Did you hide
on a ledge?

08:10.880 --> 08:12.830
Please tell me
there were tuxedos!

08:12.830 --> 08:13.830
There were tuxedos.

08:13.830 --> 08:15.580
Yes! I knew it!

08:15.580 --> 08:17.040
(whispering):
There were no tuxedos.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.210
Did you get proof
Yama's behind the crime wave?

08:19.210 --> 08:20.920
Not yet,
but I asked around.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.710
Yama's bot did fight

08:22.710 --> 08:24.460
all of the bots
involved in the robberies.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.120
Not exactly hard evidence.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.750
Which means I have to go back.

08:29.460 --> 08:30.960
I saw that.
That was a smile.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.670
Small, but a smile.

08:32.670 --> 08:34.210
You're happy to go back.

08:34.210 --> 08:35.620
(muffled scream)

08:35.620 --> 08:37.000
No.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.210
Hey, that's not
a real frown.

08:38.210 --> 08:39.380
His face is lying.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.380
(gasps)
Face liar!

08:42.380 --> 08:44.580
We just want you
to be careful, Hiro.

08:44.580 --> 08:46.330
Guys, there's nothing
to worry about.

08:46.330 --> 08:48.790
This is all business.
I promise.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.500
(Fred gasps)

08:52.710 --> 08:53.670
Face liar.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.580
(whirring, clanking)

09:03.120 --> 09:04.460
Yeah.

09:11.620 --> 09:12.830
-Yes!
-It worked!

09:12.830 --> 09:14.000
Aw.

09:14.830 --> 09:16.830
Good call
on the extra B field!

09:16.830 --> 09:19.750
Yeah, but making that perfectly
symmetrical focusing coil

09:19.750 --> 09:21.620
out of spare parts
was all you.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.420
I'm all about
the spare parts.

09:23.420 --> 09:25.540
Where'd you learn how to
bot build like that, anyway?

09:25.540 --> 09:28.080
Self-taught.
I watch, I learn.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.000
Don't let this go to your head,

09:30.000 --> 09:31.960
but I watched all your fights.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.000
You were good.
Why'd you quit?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.170
I-I don't know.
I'm over it now.

09:36.170 --> 09:38.500
Plus, my aunt wasn't a fan
of bailing me out of jail.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.170
All I'm saying is,

09:40.170 --> 09:42.460
if you like something
and you're good at it,

09:42.460 --> 09:44.040
why deny yourself?

09:44.040 --> 09:45.880
We both know you wanna.

09:51.830 --> 09:53.540
(beeping)

09:54.620 --> 09:56.540
(grunts)
Oh. H-Hi, Baymax.

09:56.540 --> 09:59.080
Hello, Hiro.
You are back late.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.500
Yeah, I mean-- I guess
I just lost track of time.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.420
Did you find proof
that Yama

10:03.420 --> 10:05.000
is responsible
for the crimes?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.250
Well, no.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.380
I'm gonna have
to go back. Again.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.790
Anyway, time for bed.

10:15.670 --> 10:17.000
(keypad beeping)

10:17.000 --> 10:18.040
(whirring)

10:18.040 --> 10:19.210
(clangs)

10:19.210 --> 10:20.920
-(alarm bell ringing)
-(screaming)

10:23.710 --> 10:24.880
(tires screeching)

10:28.620 --> 10:30.920
It's the bot
Yama fought yesterday!

10:31.960 --> 10:32.830
(yelps)

10:41.960 --> 10:44.210
It's too fast.
I can't hit it!

10:44.210 --> 10:45.830
Then we neutralize its speed.

10:45.830 --> 10:47.080
Baymax! Full power!

10:51.420 --> 10:53.330
(low-pitched pulsing)

11:03.080 --> 11:03.920
(grunts)

11:07.580 --> 11:10.210
Okay, little guy. Let's see
how Yama's controlling you.

11:12.540 --> 11:14.080
I found a string of code

11:14.080 --> 11:16.000
that allows an external
remote override.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.580
Honey Lemon:
Yama must be using his bot

11:17.580 --> 11:19.250
to infect the others
when they're fighting.

11:19.250 --> 11:21.040
If we can find
his executable file,

11:21.040 --> 11:22.120
we've got him.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.460
And how are we gonna do that?

11:23.460 --> 11:25.750
Easy. I'll keep Yama busy
by fighting him

11:25.750 --> 11:27.250
while you guys break
into his office.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.460
-Fighting him?
-(door opens)

11:28.460 --> 11:30.000
What happened
to just watching?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.040
Guys, don't worry.
I've got this.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.120
You. You're blacklisted.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.040
Yama's orders.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.330
I am? I had no idea.

11:40.330 --> 11:42.120
-(snaps fingers)
-(sighs) Too bad.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.540
A rematch between me
and Yama,

11:43.540 --> 11:45.250
that would draw a big crowd.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.620
A rematch would be good
for business.

11:47.620 --> 11:48.420
(whistles)

11:50.040 --> 11:50.920
(grunts)

11:52.120 --> 11:54.250
Fine. Pony up your buy-in.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.790
Stay out of trouble.

11:55.790 --> 11:58.250
-Deal.
-Welcome back, Zero.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.920
Your first match starts...
right now.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.170
Hamada, you coming or what?

12:03.210 --> 12:05.080
I won't go easy on you, Trina.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.380
You really think
you're gonna win

12:06.380 --> 12:08.210
with that ancient relic
of a bot?

12:08.210 --> 12:09.880
That's adorable.

12:12.830 --> 12:14.880
(gong clangs)

12:17.710 --> 12:20.120
San Fransokyo PD!
Nobody move!

12:20.120 --> 12:21.500
Trina, we--
we gotta get out of...

12:22.920 --> 12:25.120
-here.
-(sirens blaring)

12:28.290 --> 12:29.670
Aunt Cass,

12:29.670 --> 12:31.250
I know I messed up,

12:31.250 --> 12:33.580
but I have a good reason
for doing this.

12:33.580 --> 12:35.120
-I swear.
-What?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.880
I... can't tell you that part.

12:44.290 --> 12:46.330
You know what?
You're grounded, Hiro.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.170
Maybe some time alone
will help you remember

12:48.170 --> 12:49.500
what's important.

12:51.420 --> 12:54.460
I don't think I've seen
Aunt Cass this mad
in a long time.

12:54.460 --> 12:57.290
Her anger only stems
from concern,

12:57.290 --> 12:59.040
caused by your recent
poor judgment.

13:02.290 --> 13:05.040
Hiro: We're so close
to catching Yama, guys.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.250
I just need one more night,
then I'm out.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.620
Done. I-I promise.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.330
You also promised
you'd be careful.

13:10.330 --> 13:12.040
Then, you got thrown
in jail.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.830
Let's look on the bright side.
A criminal past

13:13.830 --> 13:16.210
totally gives you layers
as a protagonist.

13:16.210 --> 13:18.080
Look, I know
you guys are worried,

13:18.080 --> 13:19.500
but if we don't do this,
innocent people

13:19.500 --> 13:21.420
will keep getting framed.

13:21.420 --> 13:23.920
Oh no!
Poor... that guy.

13:23.920 --> 13:25.580
Fine.
One more night.

13:25.580 --> 13:27.120
Great. Remember the plan.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.580
While I fight Yama,
you guys get the proof.

13:28.580 --> 13:31.250
This time,
actually be careful.

13:31.250 --> 13:33.460
Aunt Cass is
usually asleep by now.

13:33.460 --> 13:35.120
Baymax:
Her current melatonin levels

13:35.120 --> 13:37.210
are consistent with wakefulness.

13:37.210 --> 13:40.040
Do you think Tadashi would
understand why I'm doing this?

13:40.040 --> 13:41.830
I am uncertain.

13:41.830 --> 13:44.210
However, Tadashi has made
one reference

13:44.210 --> 13:46.250
to bot fighting
in my archives.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.170
I'm worried about Hiro, Baymax.

13:48.170 --> 13:49.960
He's so smart,
but he's--

13:49.960 --> 13:52.210
but he's wasting
his talents bot fighting.

13:52.210 --> 13:54.960
(sighs) You know, I don't know
what I can do to help him.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.290
Well, anyway, I guess
I just have to remember that

13:57.290 --> 13:58.920
Hiro's a good kid.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.710
And in the end,
he'll do what's right.

14:01.420 --> 14:03.920
I still do not understand
bot fighting.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.750
But Tadashi was right.

14:05.750 --> 14:08.040
Hiro, you are a good kid.

14:09.170 --> 14:10.500
Aunt Cass is now asleep.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.670
(snoring)

14:18.250 --> 14:20.380
(whirring)

14:20.380 --> 14:23.830
Hamada.
I wasn't sure you'd be back
after you got busted.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.920
Well, I'm here.
Guess I just wanted
to see this through.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.170
How inspiring.

14:27.170 --> 14:30.120
Defeating you is
gonna be a real honor.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.330
(clangs)

14:31.330 --> 14:32.330
(whirring, chittering)

14:45.460 --> 14:46.790
(high-pitched pulse)

14:46.790 --> 14:49.250
Sorry, not sorry, Hamada! I win!

14:49.250 --> 14:50.790
You sure about that?

14:56.920 --> 14:58.920
What? A counter current?

14:58.920 --> 15:00.920
I had to neutralize
your new weapon somehow.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.540
You let yourself
get wrapped up

15:02.540 --> 15:04.580
so you could damage
my focusing coil.

15:04.580 --> 15:06.620
Yeah. Things aren't always
as they seem.

15:06.620 --> 15:09.170
-(sighs) At least
I was beaten by the best.
-(yelps)

15:12.000 --> 15:13.710
Good luck with the rest
of your bracket.

15:15.880 --> 15:16.790
Huh.

15:19.540 --> 15:21.540
(whirring,
electricity crackling)

15:31.250 --> 15:33.170
Ha! Ha!

15:36.250 --> 15:38.210
Hey, Yama.
Long time no see.

15:38.210 --> 15:40.330
I guess it is tougher
to chicken out

15:40.330 --> 15:41.580
with all these people
watching.

15:41.580 --> 15:43.330
You're lucky people will pay

15:43.330 --> 15:44.540
to see our rematch.

15:49.250 --> 15:50.790
-Let's go.
-Spy time!

15:54.080 --> 15:55.330
(saw whirring)

16:02.580 --> 16:05.710
If I was a super-secret
hidden tool for a crime wave,

16:05.710 --> 16:07.830
-where would I be?
-Oh, I don't know,

16:07.830 --> 16:09.290
in a biometric safe
under the desk?

16:09.290 --> 16:12.830
(laughs)
That's way too obvious, Go Go.

16:12.830 --> 16:15.960
Oh, Yama.
I expected so much more.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.330
We need
Yama's fingerprints.

16:20.500 --> 16:23.500
-(safe beeping softly)
-♪ Dah-da-dah-dah, dah-dah-- ♪

16:23.500 --> 16:25.040
-(single loud beep)
-Ow!

16:25.040 --> 16:26.670
Honey Lemon:
That has to be it, right?

16:26.670 --> 16:28.040
Hmm. One way to find out.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.170
(beeping)

16:31.120 --> 16:32.460
(screams)

16:32.460 --> 16:34.960
I want to look away,
but I can't.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.380
(whirring, clanking)

16:43.880 --> 16:46.290
You got lucky again, Zero.

16:46.290 --> 16:47.670
Is it luck if it
keeps happening?

16:47.670 --> 16:49.540
-(grunts)
-(bot clatters)

16:52.040 --> 16:53.210
(cell phone chimes)

16:55.330 --> 16:56.790
What's up, guys?
Did you get the proof?

16:56.790 --> 16:58.580
Actually, no.

16:58.580 --> 17:03.330
But we did just see
a really interesting video...

17:03.330 --> 17:04.540
that clears him.

17:04.540 --> 17:06.460
And let me just say,
it's not something

17:06.460 --> 17:08.210
you can ever unsee.

17:08.210 --> 17:10.920
(samba music playing)

17:14.330 --> 17:17.460
Yama's class was
at the exact same time
as the robberies.

17:17.460 --> 17:19.000
And gives him an alibi.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.120
And me nightmares.

17:20.120 --> 17:21.460
Which means
he's innocent!

17:21.460 --> 17:23.460
And the man can samba.
I was moved.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.790
But losing to Yama
is the only thing

17:25.790 --> 17:27.540
all the hijacked bots have
in common.

17:27.540 --> 17:30.500
Sorry, Hiro. The evidence says
it's someone else.

17:30.500 --> 17:34.000
Like who? The only other
possible connection is--

17:38.460 --> 17:40.290
You've fought
every night this week,

17:40.290 --> 17:42.380
and you haven't made it past
the first round once!

17:42.380 --> 17:46.120
Unless the bots all got
infected in the first round.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.750
(squeaking)

17:47.750 --> 17:48.790
(door opens, closes)

17:48.790 --> 17:50.460
Hamada. Gotta say,

17:50.460 --> 17:53.920
that fight against Yama
was a thing of beauty.

17:55.750 --> 17:58.460
-What?
-I know about the bots, Trina.

17:58.460 --> 17:59.540
I know it's you.

17:59.540 --> 18:01.080
So, the boy genius

18:01.080 --> 18:02.620
finally figured me out.

18:02.620 --> 18:04.080
-(cell phone beeping)
-Why are you doing this?

18:04.080 --> 18:06.420
'Cause it's lucrative
and fun?

18:06.420 --> 18:08.750
I thought out of anyone,
you'd get it.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.380
I do get it. My brother
got me out of bot fighting

18:11.380 --> 18:12.960
and into SFIT.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.000
You're smart, Trina.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.500
You could turn
your life around too.

18:16.500 --> 18:19.420
People like us never really
turn around, Hamada.

18:19.420 --> 18:21.460
-We just pretend to.
-That's not true.

18:21.460 --> 18:23.670
Isn't it?
I saw you earlier.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.500
You still love bot fighting
as much as I do.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.500
Stop holding
yourself back!

18:28.500 --> 18:30.500
That's it. We're taking her in.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.460
It's so cute that
you think you can.

18:32.460 --> 18:36.290
-(beeps)
-(powering up)

18:49.790 --> 18:51.460
-(whirring)
-Huh?

18:57.920 --> 18:59.880
♪ Dah-dah! ♪
Ow!

19:04.250 --> 19:05.170
Uh-oh.

19:06.880 --> 19:07.830
Huh?

19:07.830 --> 19:09.420
Go! We got this!

19:11.670 --> 19:13.380
Wasabi:
We don't got this! We don't!

19:13.380 --> 19:14.500
We really don't!

19:14.500 --> 19:15.830
Fred:
Everything hurts!

19:19.500 --> 19:20.920
-(grunts)
-(screaming)

19:26.670 --> 19:27.790
(screams)

19:30.670 --> 19:32.420
Guys, hold it off!
I have an idea!

19:33.460 --> 19:34.500
-Got it!
-Honey Lemon: Okay.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.250
-(Fred screaming)
-(clattering)

19:37.120 --> 19:38.250
Please hurry.

19:40.210 --> 19:42.210
If I can rewrite
Trina's code in this bot,

19:42.210 --> 19:44.330
then transfer it to mine,
I can take back control.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.170
(all gasp)

19:50.670 --> 19:51.830
-(beeping)
-Done.

19:56.380 --> 19:58.040
-Is that--
-It is!

20:10.080 --> 20:11.080
(snickering)

20:15.750 --> 20:17.120
Oh, yes.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.750
And-- No, no, no,
no, no. Ow!

20:21.210 --> 20:22.710
(groaning)

20:22.710 --> 20:24.120
Great work, Hiro!
But for real, though...

20:24.120 --> 20:25.540
Ow!

20:27.330 --> 20:30.580
Guys, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

20:30.580 --> 20:32.830
I got so carried away
with the bot fighting,

20:32.830 --> 20:34.620
I didn't notice
what Trina was doing.

20:34.620 --> 20:36.380
Aah! She disguised herself

20:36.380 --> 20:38.250
in a fake mustache
of fake friendship.

20:38.250 --> 20:40.670
Which is the
biggest face lie of all.

20:40.670 --> 20:43.500
Right. I am done
with bot fights.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.330
Good. We were worried
about you.

20:45.330 --> 20:46.790
I know.

20:46.790 --> 20:48.750
And I know I could've
ended up just like Trina

20:48.750 --> 20:50.080
if it hadn't been
for Tadashi

20:50.080 --> 20:51.750
and Aunt Cass
a-and you guys.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.540
So thanks.

20:53.540 --> 20:54.710
For worrying about me.

20:59.710 --> 21:02.210
Good haul today, Father.

21:03.710 --> 21:05.580
You've been collecting trinkets?

21:05.580 --> 21:09.210
What a grand waste
of time.

21:09.210 --> 21:12.330
Show me something useful. Now!

21:14.920 --> 21:16.460
I do get it.

21:16.460 --> 21:18.420
My brother got me
out of bot fighting

21:18.420 --> 21:19.580
and into SFIT.

21:20.540 --> 21:21.920
We offered him freedom,

21:21.920 --> 21:24.620
and he chose
to leash himself again.

21:29.210 --> 21:32.080
It's time to move forward.

21:34.290 --> 21:36.290
