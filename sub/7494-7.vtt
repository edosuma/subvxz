WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:02.136
Last time on
Make It Pop.

00:02.170 --> 00:03.871
"Masked Girl Sells
Out Roller Rink?"

00:03.904 --> 00:07.108
Caleb, wanna go to
the dance with me??

00:07.141 --> 00:10.111
Corki: I'm starting to
realize high school is a

00:10.144 --> 00:12.446
lot more complicated than
I thought it was.

00:12.480 --> 00:17.351
(alarm)

00:19.653 --> 00:24.825
Boys to the left,
girls to the right.

00:24.858 --> 00:25.926
Now!!!

00:30.831 --> 00:35.769
Ahem.

00:35.803 --> 00:38.506
It seems that the air
conditioning system upstairs

00:38.539 --> 00:41.041
has malfunctioned
and sprung a leak.

00:41.075 --> 00:44.812
Who's responsible for this!?

00:44.845 --> 00:47.748
The entire boys' floor
has now been declared

00:47.781 --> 00:49.117
a toxic environment.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.585
You may have
noticed the stench.

00:51.619 --> 00:54.688
Is it different from
the usual smell of boy

00:54.722 --> 00:58.826
This is more chemical,
less monkey house.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.728
Make way.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.663
Coming through.

01:02.696 --> 01:03.864
Stand aside.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.766
Sacrifices will
have to be made

01:05.799 --> 01:07.701
until the upstairs
is safe again.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.104
So, in my
infinite wisdom,

01:10.138 --> 01:12.640
all girls on the
right side of the hall

01:12.673 --> 01:16.810
will move into the girls' room
directly opposite their room.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.579
I'll show those teacher
evaluations who

01:18.612 --> 01:22.750
lacks problem
solving skills.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.085
No way.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.087
Yes way.

01:27.121 --> 01:29.490
And, boys, you will occupy
the empty girls' room

01:29.523 --> 01:31.091
on the right
side of the hall.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.126
Boys in our room?

01:32.160 --> 01:33.527
My father won't
like this.

01:33.561 --> 01:39.066
You will also be
sharing the showers.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.101
which will be allocated
to boys and girls

01:41.135 --> 01:44.238
at very specific
and separate times.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.773
I probably shouldn't
have paused

01:45.806 --> 01:48.742
so long after the first
part of that sentence.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.845
Anywho, here's
your hall monitor.

01:51.879 --> 01:52.613
Nobody worry.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.516
The hero of
the hall is here.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.918
Ladies, you have ten
minutes to move out of your

01:57.951 --> 01:59.720
old rooms and into
your new ones.

01:59.753 --> 02:00.721
Bring only
the necessities.

02:00.754 --> 02:05.159
Okay okay, we
can move.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.194
Hi Jared.

02:06.227 --> 02:06.727
Hi Corki.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.561
I like your outfit.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.863
Do you like my sash
and tool belt?

02:09.897 --> 02:10.464
Too much?

02:10.498 --> 02:12.866
No no,
they're perfect.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.202
I know.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.803
One always needs
a measuring tape,

02:15.836 --> 02:17.605
a flashlight,
and a whisk.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.872
Great for merengue.

02:18.906 --> 02:22.075
Light and fluffy.

02:22.109 --> 02:23.577
(whistle blows)

02:23.611 --> 02:25.513
Yes this is an
emergency, but remember,

02:25.546 --> 02:28.982
there is nothing to fear.

02:29.016 --> 02:34.655
Stand aside,
coming through,

02:34.688 --> 02:35.856
Sun Hi: Except
living with,

02:35.889 --> 02:40.661
Her!

02:40.694 --> 02:44.232
This is gonna be
a long night.

02:44.265 --> 02:47.668
* Make it pop, woo, woo

02:47.701 --> 02:50.538
* Make it pop, woo, woo

02:50.571 --> 02:57.545
* I can't wait, no I can't wait
no, I can't wait, no *

02:57.578 --> 02:59.547
* I can't wait

02:59.580 --> 03:02.750
* So make it pop, we're bout to,
we're bout to blow *

03:02.783 --> 03:05.753
* Wait till we drop, oh
yeah, we're ready to go *

03:05.786 --> 03:08.756
* Ain't gonna stop, when is
it time for the show *

03:08.789 --> 03:11.559
* We make it, you make
it, they make it *

03:11.592 --> 03:13.894
* M-m-m-m-m-m-
Make it pop *

03:20.934 --> 03:21.835
Hi, Sun Hi!

03:21.869 --> 03:23.203
How are you?

03:23.237 --> 03:24.071
Fine, Val.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.006
Thanks for your
gracious hospitality.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.075
Don't look her in
the eye, Corki.

03:28.108 --> 03:33.180
It's how she
takes your soul.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.948
Um, what is that?

03:34.982 --> 03:36.216
A dressmaker's dummy.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.685
There's no
room for that!

03:37.718 --> 03:39.287
I'm already taking
in three of you.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.922
This is going
to be so fun.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.658
Look, I know we've had
our issues in the past,

03:44.692 --> 03:48.061
but this is my room and there
are rules to the Val Pod that

03:48.095 --> 03:50.664
must be followed if we are
to survive this emergency.

03:50.698 --> 03:51.399
Val Pod?

03:51.432 --> 03:52.933
It's all Val,
all the time.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.001
Where's the other Valette?

03:54.034 --> 03:54.802
Luge finals.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.604
Heather won't be
back 'til Friday.

03:56.637 --> 03:59.640
So there's your bed.

03:59.673 --> 04:03.744
I'll take the couch!

04:03.777 --> 04:05.178
Now, the rules.

04:05.212 --> 04:08.716
Number one, all clothes
must be put away.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.319
Two, there's no
studying after 10 PM.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.620
I need my sleep.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.722
Good for the complexion.

04:14.755 --> 04:18.992
Three, never, ever touch someone
else's custom skin lotion,

04:19.026 --> 04:22.696
It is very expensive.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.732
Wow, she talks a lot.

04:24.765 --> 04:25.999
Valerie: Hello?

04:26.033 --> 04:27.267
Hey!

04:27.301 --> 04:29.202
I'm pretty sure there
is a rule against this to!

04:29.236 --> 04:30.404
Ugh where is it?

04:30.438 --> 04:32.773
What are you
looking for?

04:32.806 --> 04:35.208
I think I left my cell
phone in our room.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.410
You think
or you did?

04:36.444 --> 04:39.847
I'll be right back.

04:39.880 --> 04:43.083
Rule number twelve, never
lock me out of my own room!

04:43.116 --> 04:48.121
Come on!

04:48.155 --> 04:52.760
The Val Pod!!

04:52.793 --> 04:54.828
This might
actually be fun.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.836
(whistle)

05:02.870 --> 05:03.904
Halt.

05:03.937 --> 05:04.838
Who goes there?

05:04.872 --> 05:05.673
Halt?

05:05.706 --> 05:07.408
It sounds more
official than whoa!

05:07.441 --> 05:09.410
You need to go
back to your room.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.310
No girls allowed.

05:10.344 --> 05:14.415
Really?

05:14.448 --> 05:17.184
Did I not just say,
no girls allowed?

05:17.217 --> 05:21.422
Sorry, didn't
hear that.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.089
Come on.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.391
No can do.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.793
If I let you go,
someone else will ask,

05:25.826 --> 05:28.962
then another, and then
do you know what we have?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.197
A lot of
happy people?

05:30.230 --> 05:31.799
No! Anarchy.

05:31.832 --> 05:37.304
No passing the line--
not until this crisis is over.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.475
It's so furry...

05:41.509 --> 05:42.175
Pink.

05:42.209 --> 05:43.411
Soft.

05:43.444 --> 05:46.847
Like the plush monster
yacked all over it.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.484
Bluhh..

05:50.518 --> 05:54.187
Comin through.

05:57.324 --> 05:59.893
So what's this?

05:59.927 --> 06:02.763
It's a loofah
for exfoliati--

06:02.796 --> 06:04.197
I mean... I dunno.

06:04.231 --> 06:05.966
Pft.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.903
Hey guys,

06:09.937 --> 06:10.971
Corki will be here soon.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.106
She's just in the library
finishing her homework--

06:13.140 --> 06:14.508
Caleb, do you
have my phone?

06:14.542 --> 06:16.910
I left you like ten
messages to get it.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.446
I only saw
Jodi's messages.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.414
Those were
my messages!

06:20.448 --> 06:21.882
Didn't you listen to them?!

06:21.915 --> 06:23.150
No not yet.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.953
I have to work up the nerve to
listen to messages from girls.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.489
(laughing)

06:28.522 --> 06:31.124
Get me my phone,
I need it!

06:31.158 --> 06:35.028
Got it?!

06:35.062 --> 06:40.768
So, you didn't call me?

06:40.801 --> 06:45.138
Did you want me
to call you?

06:45.172 --> 06:49.342
Hello, let's
do this thing!

06:49.376 --> 06:54.915
And where
is, Corki?

06:54.948 --> 06:58.519
* We love em boys

in the locker room *

07:26.947 --> 07:29.016
* Howling at the moon

07:29.049 --> 07:31.284
* Trying to make us swoon

07:31.318 --> 07:35.155
* How can you blame us when

07:35.188 --> 07:39.326

07:39.359 --> 07:43.330

08:31.044 --> 08:33.013
* With our friends
and that's true *

08:33.046 --> 08:35.583
* Swapping lipstick
and rouge *

08:35.616 --> 08:39.352
* Then we go check if
they update their page *

08:39.386 --> 08:42.923

Jared: Hey!

09:22.295 --> 09:24.531
Is she here?

09:24.564 --> 09:25.365
Um who?

09:25.398 --> 09:26.533
Masked Girl.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.535
Seriously,
who is she?

09:28.568 --> 09:30.437
Who is she?

09:30.470 --> 09:31.639
Who am I?

09:31.672 --> 09:33.440
Who are any of us?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.248
Jared!

09:41.281 --> 09:43.116
What are you
doing here?

09:43.150 --> 09:45.052
Just looking for
Masked Girl.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.187
She intrigues
me, you know?

09:47.220 --> 09:50.691
But you've never
even seen her face.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.994
I mean as far as
I know you haven't.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.462
But you must
know her.

09:55.495 --> 09:58.531
I mean, your roommates
are in a band with her.

09:58.565 --> 10:02.102
Come to think of it, I don't
think I've ever seen you

10:02.135 --> 10:05.072
and Masked Girl in the same
place at the same time.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.007
Oh, well.

10:07.040 --> 10:12.279
I'm hardly ever in the
same place as other people.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.281
Very shy,
you know?

10:14.314 --> 10:19.452
Uh, so shy.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.588
I gotta go!

10:26.193 --> 10:29.296
Stand aside,
coming through.

10:29.329 --> 10:32.532
Ohmm.

10:32.565 --> 10:33.667
What are you doing?

10:33.701 --> 10:34.835
Textercizing.

10:34.868 --> 10:38.438
I need to keep my thumbs fit
until I get my phone back.

10:38.471 --> 10:44.778
Rule number sixty twooo, volume
is low, when I'm saying Ohmm.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.379
He's gonna find out!

10:46.413 --> 10:53.020
What part of "Ohm"
do you not understand?

10:53.053 --> 10:55.122
Jared is going
to find out.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.456
Find out what?

10:56.489 --> 10:59.059
That I'm, you know...

10:59.092 --> 11:00.460
Then just tell
him the truth.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.463
But I'm not sure if I'm ready
for people to know yet.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.098
Plus, I'm just me.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.367
Masked Girl is
his perfect girl.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.537
How am I supposed
to live up to that?

11:10.570 --> 11:11.404
Hello!

11:11.438 --> 11:15.242
Do you not understand
what quiet is?

11:15.275 --> 11:17.377
Not really,
could you explain?

11:17.410 --> 11:19.312
It is the
absence of sound.

11:19.346 --> 11:23.050
No noise or movement,
that includes talking.

11:23.083 --> 11:27.620
So, if we are to coexist,
you guys need to listen...

11:27.654 --> 11:29.456
How does that
keep working?

11:29.489 --> 11:30.523
Valerie: Really?

11:30.557 --> 11:31.658
Again?

11:31.691 --> 11:34.227
This is so childish.

11:34.261 --> 11:38.398
Corki, if Jared likes Masked
Girl, then he likes you.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.499
You're the same person.

11:39.532 --> 11:44.171
Just like Cinderella,
except your shoe is a mask.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.073
And your foot is a face.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.240
That's a fairy tale.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.608
This is real life.

11:48.641 --> 11:52.379
And real life
is complicated.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.380
Valerie, do you mind?

11:53.413 --> 11:55.515
We're trying to have a
conversation in here.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.416
It's Caleb.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.785
I have something
for Sun Hi.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.560
Wait, this isn't
my phone.

12:07.594 --> 12:10.397
It's Dylan's, I
couldn't find yours.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.399
I thought you'd be
okay with any phone.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.400
Okay with any phone.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.067
Who are you?!

12:14.101 --> 12:15.602
So, it's still in our room.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.270
And Jared is in our room.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.739
And you have photos
of me with the mask?

12:19.773 --> 12:22.509
Yes, why are you--

12:22.542 --> 12:24.144
Ooooooooh,
that's not good.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.647
Argh, this is
terrible.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.383
Corki, Corki it's Jared.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.619
Are you in there,
I need to see you.

12:32.652 --> 12:33.453
Oh no.

12:33.486 --> 12:37.257
Corki, open up please.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.392
Can I help you?

12:39.426 --> 12:40.527
It's you, isn't it?

12:40.560 --> 12:41.494
It depends.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.563
What are we
talking about?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.565
I think I know, Corki.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.835
Corki, close the door.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.871
We're in here doing
facials and rehearsing.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.907
Yes Corki, close
the door, girlfriend.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.142
It's her.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.643
Masked Girl!

12:56.676 --> 13:00.380
* Hanging out with
my girlfriends *

13:00.413 --> 13:05.185
* Doing things
that we wanna do *

13:05.218 --> 13:08.488
She's so, big!

13:08.521 --> 13:10.824
Masked Girl,
I need to talk to you!

13:10.858 --> 13:12.359
My name is
Jared Anderson!

13:12.392 --> 13:13.526
I'm a big fan!

13:13.560 --> 13:14.895
We are connected.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.196
Sorry, Jared.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.898
Off limits,
remember?

13:17.931 --> 13:20.367
And anyway, Masked Girl
doesn't like to be interrupted.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.836
* Get the party started

13:22.870 --> 13:26.739
Sounds like she
needs to practice.

13:26.773 --> 13:30.543
Masked Girl, is it true you
climbed Mount Everest backwards?

13:30.577 --> 13:33.881
I need to know!

13:33.914 --> 13:35.582
Hopefully that
bought you some time.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.951
We still gotta
get that phone.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.420
I like this robe.

13:40.453 --> 13:46.393
Ahem, I mean I
like this robe.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.228
(bell rings)

13:55.502 --> 14:00.440
Boys should wax.

14:00.473 --> 14:01.641
Jared: Off limits.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.976
What are you doing?

14:03.010 --> 14:05.578
Jared -- I really need
to get into my room.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.980
I left my phone
in there.

14:07.014 --> 14:10.350
I told you--
no crossing the line.

14:10.383 --> 14:14.321
Unless you want to tell
me about Masked Girl.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.224
Then maybe we can
work something out.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.259
Argh, curse you,
conscience.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.361
In that case,
I can't help you either.

14:21.394 --> 14:25.765
But, Jared, this is a very
special and meaningful phone.

14:25.798 --> 14:28.601
It was the
phone that my--

14:28.635 --> 14:30.971
great great
grandmother used to--

14:31.004 --> 14:33.306
text her friends with.

14:33.340 --> 14:33.907
When she was--

14:33.941 --> 14:35.308
a little girl.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.644
That's a very sad story.

14:37.677 --> 14:38.811
So I can enter?

14:38.845 --> 14:39.846
Not a chance.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.215
Now go before
I report you.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.426
Not on my watch.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.295
Stop!

14:55.328 --> 14:55.929
Sir.

14:55.963 --> 14:56.563
No.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.731
No talk,
no excuses.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.567
Until this
situation is resolved,

15:00.600 --> 15:04.437
boys are the Montagues,
Girls are the Capulets.

15:04.471 --> 15:05.538
Look it up.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.008
It's under "Shakespeare".

15:08.041 --> 15:12.980
Don't speak... go.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.381
Ugh. I had it.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.582
It was in my hands.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.418
What are
we gonna do?

15:18.451 --> 15:19.452
Get creative.

15:21.888 --> 15:24.457
Coming through,
stand aside.

15:24.491 --> 15:27.794
Team: 1, 2, 3 -
1, 2, 3

15:27.827 --> 15:28.895
Hold up.

15:28.928 --> 15:29.729
Shower first.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.732
Let's go.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.034
Not necessary.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.070
Didn't sweat much.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.606
Hygiene is a MacKendrick
Prep trademark.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.608
If we can't have the
best sports teams,

15:41.641 --> 15:43.810
at least we can have
the sweetest smelling.

15:43.843 --> 15:52.052
Now get in there, soap
up, and make us proud.

15:52.085 --> 15:57.490
Ahhhhhhhh.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.433
What am I
supposed to say?

16:06.466 --> 16:07.700
It doesn't matter.

16:07.734 --> 16:11.104
Just keep him at the end of the
hall so Sun Hi can sneak over

16:11.138 --> 16:12.639
and get her phone.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.510
Halt!

16:17.544 --> 16:18.545
Who goes there?

16:18.578 --> 16:20.447
It is I, Corki.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.649
I mean, It's me.

16:22.682 --> 16:23.816
Oh, hey, sorry.

16:23.850 --> 16:28.721
I'm a little
on edge.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.590
I know that when
we spoke before,

16:30.623 --> 16:32.525
you thought I was
Masked Girl--

16:32.559 --> 16:33.626
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.627
That was crazy.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.562
It was?

16:35.595 --> 16:40.067
Yeah, I mean I like you,
but Masked Girl?

16:40.100 --> 16:42.535
She's this great performer
and you're shy.

16:42.569 --> 16:46.406
You're pretty, really pretty,
but Masked Girl--

16:46.439 --> 16:48.775
There's no explaining
that kind of chemistry.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.410
Plus, you'd never lie.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.645
You said you weren't her,
and I believe you.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.880
Of course.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.882
Her voice might take
some getting used to,

16:55.915 --> 16:58.985
but no one's perfect.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.055
I take it back,
almost no one.

17:50.803 --> 17:54.107
Where is it?!

17:54.141 --> 17:59.146
Um.

17:59.179 --> 18:05.185
Looking for something?

18:09.822 --> 18:10.590
I got it!

18:10.623 --> 18:17.664
I got it!

18:17.697 --> 18:22.469
(cheering)

18:22.502 --> 18:28.908
Anarchy, chaos, whatever,
ignorance is bliss.

18:28.941 --> 18:32.212
Nooo. The wall!

18:32.245 --> 18:36.583
Wooooo!

18:36.616 --> 18:39.619
* What's up, there's
something in the air *

18:39.652 --> 18:41.821
* It's that feeling when
the weekend comes *

18:41.854 --> 18:44.023
* Say what you
doing way up there *

18:44.056 --> 18:46.626
* I think that we could
have some fun *

18:46.659 --> 18:49.028
* I know this place
that we could go *

18:49.061 --> 18:51.030
* We're not invited
but who cares *

18:51.063 --> 18:53.233
* We girls are
putting on a show *

18:53.266 --> 18:55.768
* There's so much
happening out there *

18:55.802 --> 18:57.837
* Out there

18:57.870 --> 19:00.072
* Out there

19:00.106 --> 19:02.041
* Party People!

19:02.074 --> 19:06.145
* Do whatever, ever, ever
Be whatever, ever, ever *

19:06.179 --> 19:09.182
* Dance forever,

19:09.216 --> 19:12.985
* So climb out your window,
cos' we're waiting for you *

19:13.019 --> 19:17.890
* We're gonna party

19:17.924 --> 19:21.528
* We'll go crash a party,
call up everybody *

19:21.561 --> 19:26.132
* We're gonna party
tonight oh oh oh *

19:26.165 --> 19:29.636
* Forget what your head says,
we're young and we love it *

19:29.669 --> 19:34.140

19:34.173 --> 19:37.844

19:43.983 --> 19:46.553

up with a text *

19:46.586 --> 19:48.755
* We'll turn some speakers
up and dance *

19:48.788 --> 19:51.891
* Break rules with Charli XCX
and throw stuff up on Instagram*

19:51.924 --> 19:53.926
* Set fireworks
off in the parks *

19:53.960 --> 19:56.128
* And watch them
lighting up the air *

19:56.162 --> 19:58.164
* We'll crash out
underneath the stars *

19:58.197 --> 20:01.834
* There's so much
happening out there *

20:01.868 --> 20:03.903
* Out there

* Dance forever,

20:52.952 --> 20:54.754
Hey, look who's
coming our way

20:54.787 --> 20:57.089
Sorry about bringing
the wall down, Jared.

20:57.123 --> 21:00.793
But I think we've all learned an
important lesson here today--

21:00.827 --> 21:04.697
it's easier to just
give me what I want.

21:04.731 --> 21:09.001
Why was this
in your room?

21:09.035 --> 21:12.972
Um, there's a perfectly
good explanation for that.

21:13.005 --> 21:17.344
Which I will tell you, as
soon as it pops into my head.

21:17.377 --> 21:18.411
Yea, I got nuthin'.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.313
It's okay, Jodi.

21:20.347 --> 21:27.053
It's over, It's mine.

21:27.086 --> 21:32.158
I'm Masked Girl.
