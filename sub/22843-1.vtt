HMM. WHY DON'T WE
PLAN EVERYTHING

01:09.503 --> 01:10.771
FOR A HALF AN HOUR LATER,

01:10.804 --> 01:12.673
AND MAYBE YOU'LL BE
ON TIME FOR ONCE.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.575
GOOD MORNING
TO YOU, TOO, ASHLEY.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.110
GOOD MORNING, THOMAS.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.111
IS EVERYONE HERE?

01:17.145 --> 01:18.579
ALL BOARD MEMBERS ARE HERE.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.348
I ALSO WANTED TO REMIND YOU
THAT YOU HAVE A MEETING

01:20.381 --> 01:21.815
WITH JACK FIELDS
FROM REAL CAMPS TODAY.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.651
OH, YEAH, HE WANTS TO TALK
ABOUT STARTING A GRANT

01:23.684 --> 01:25.486
FOR UNDERPRIVILEGED KIDS
TO ATTEND THE SPORTS CAMPS,

01:25.519 --> 01:27.321
-RIGHT?
-YOU ARE CORRECT.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.357
CAN'T SAY NO TO THE KIDS.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.658
EVERYBODY NEEDS A CHANCE.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.660
YOU KNOW WHAT MY OLD COACH
USED TO SAY?

01:32.693 --> 01:36.430
JUST GIVE 'EM A CHANCE!

01:36.464 --> 01:39.133
IS THAT YOUR VERSION
OF A JOKE?

01:39.167 --> 01:41.469
WHATEVER, LET'S GO.

01:41.502 --> 01:42.703
THE ONLY ITEM
WE NEED TO DISCUSS

01:42.736 --> 01:44.272
IS OUR TOP 10 BAKERIES

01:44.305 --> 01:45.806
FOR THE INSPIRATIONAL
BAKERY GRANT.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.575
BUT WE RECEIVED A TON
OF SUBMISSIONS,

01:47.608 --> 01:49.377
BUT WE NARROWED THEM DOWN
TO A FINAL FEW.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.412
ENCLOSED YOU WILL FIND
A LIST OF BAKERIES,

01:51.445 --> 01:53.847
THEIR DEMOGRAPHICS,
LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION,

01:53.881 --> 01:56.917
-AND THEIR PAST OUTREACH
IN THEIR COMMUNITY.
-BABE'S BAKERY?

01:56.950 --> 01:59.520
YES, I KNOW, THAT'S THE PLACE
YOUR MOTHER STARTED.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.189
I THINK IT'S GREAT
THAT THEY'RE LIVING UP

02:01.222 --> 02:02.290
TO YOUR MOTHER'S NAME.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.624
YEAH.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.326
WHO'S THE NEW OWNER NOW?

02:05.359 --> 02:07.261
IT'S BEEN PASSED DOWN
FROM THE GRANDMOTHER

02:07.295 --> 02:10.231
BY TO-- NOW OWNER,
ALYSSA STOCK.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.633
29 YEARS OLD.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.335
SHE'S OWNED THE BAKERY
FOR SEVEN YEARS

02:14.368 --> 02:16.204
SINCE HER GRANDMOTHER
PASSED IT ONTO HER.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.639
SHE'S BEEN IN
A FEW MAGAZINES,

02:18.672 --> 02:20.274
AND HER CUPCAKES
ARE RANKED

02:20.308 --> 02:23.211
AS ONE OF THE TOP 20
DESSERTS IN AMERICA.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.745
SHE'S BEEN BIG
IN THE COMMUNITY

02:24.778 --> 02:27.448
WITH SPONSORING
MANY YOUTH PROGRAMS
IN THE PAST,

02:27.481 --> 02:29.717
BUT FOR SOME REASON
THIS YEAR,

02:29.750 --> 02:32.186
SHE HASN'T GIVEN ANYTHING
TO THE COMMUNITY.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.654
INTERESTING.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.789
WELL, I'M EXCITED
TO SEE WHO'S GOING TO BE

02:35.823 --> 02:37.425
OUR NEW WINNER THIS YEAR.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.892
ASHLEY, DO YOU HAVE
A LIST OF WHERE

02:38.926 --> 02:40.494
EVERYONE'S TRAVELING TO
TO GO EVALUATE?

02:40.528 --> 02:42.930
YES, MISS WISE,
WE HAVE YOU GOING

02:42.963 --> 02:45.833
TO DAVE'S DANISHES AND CAKES
IN MIAMI.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.769
MISS PARKER,
WE HAVE YOU GOING

02:48.802 --> 02:51.339
TO BABE'S BAKERY
IN COLUMBUS.

02:51.372 --> 02:56.244
ACTUALLY, I'LL GO
TO BABE'S BAKERY IN COLUMBUS
AND EVALUATE MYSELF.

02:56.277 --> 02:59.647
UM-- I HAVE MISS PARKER
STAYING AT THE HYATT DOWNTOWN.
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.549
-I ACTUALLY HAVE
A PLACE THERE.
-OKAY.

03:01.582 --> 03:04.485
REMEMBER,
WE NEED TO COME UP
WITH OUR TOP FINALISTS

03:04.518 --> 03:05.619
BY NEXT FRIDAY.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.655
THAT'S SEVEN DAYS FROM NOW.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.523
AND THEN PICK A RECIPIENT
A WEEK LATER.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.725
DOES EVERYBODY FEEL
CONFIDENT ABOUT THAT?

03:11.759 --> 03:13.494
YEAH, WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.596
GREAT.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.466
YEAH, I'M FLYING IN TONIGHT,
SO I WILL PROBABLY CATCH UP

03:18.499 --> 03:19.633
WITH YOU TOMORROW.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.269
ARE YOU BRINGING
SOMEONE WITH YOU?

03:21.302 --> 03:22.570
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME?

03:22.603 --> 03:24.772
ARE YOU COMING ALONE?

03:24.805 --> 03:26.440
YES.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.576
OKAY, I'M JUST SAYING
THAT THE LAST TIME

03:28.609 --> 03:29.977
YOU CAME IN TOWN
AND I THREW THE MOST

03:30.010 --> 03:31.612
EPIC BACHELOR PARTY
FOR YOU.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.714
I KNOW YOU REMEMBER
JANGLE JACKSON.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.283
RIGHT?

03:35.316 --> 03:36.750
THE JANGLE JACKSON--
YOU KNOW.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.619
YOU CAN'T SEE
WHAT I'M DOING,

03:38.652 --> 03:41.989
BUT HER SISTER, KYLIE,
I DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT KYLIE,

03:42.022 --> 03:43.457
OH, MY GOD.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.459
SISKEL AND EBERT,
TWO THUMBS UP.

03:45.493 --> 03:48.562
WHOA, OKAY. NO,
NO ONE'S COMING WITH ME.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.364
I'M DONE BEING TIED DOWN.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.800
WOW!
WHO IS THIS?

03:52.833 --> 03:55.035
WHO IS THIS?
YOU DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.805
WHO IS THIS?
IS THIS THE SAME GUY,

03:57.838 --> 03:59.373
EVEN WHEN PLAYING
PROFESSIONAL BALL,

03:59.407 --> 04:00.841
AND EVERYBODY
KNEW WHO HE WAS,

04:00.874 --> 04:02.543
WAS AFRAID
TO TALK TO GIRLS

04:02.576 --> 04:04.678
UNLESS THEY
STARED AT HIM?

04:04.712 --> 04:06.414
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT UNLESS
SHE LOOKS AT YOU

04:06.447 --> 04:08.916
MORE THAN TWO SECONDS,
SHE'S NOT INTERESTED.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.452
RIGHT NOW, THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL
DOING MY FINGERS,

04:11.485 --> 04:13.487
IT'S AMAZING SHE DOESN'T
SPEAK ENGLISH,

04:13.521 --> 04:16.690
'CAUSE-- I FEEL LIKE I'D BE
FREAKIN' HER OUT A LITTLE BIT.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.791
SHE HASN'T LOOKED AT ME ONCE,
AND I REALLY THINK

04:18.826 --> 04:20.928
I COULD TAKE HER HOME
RIGHT NOW.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.863
ON ANOTHER NOTE,
I AM GOING OUT

04:22.896 --> 04:24.398
WITH A FRIEND
TONIGHT THOUGH.

04:24.432 --> 04:27.735
FRIEND?
WHO?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.069
WHY AREN'T YOU
SAYING ANYTHING?

04:29.102 --> 04:30.438
IS IT AN EX?

04:30.471 --> 04:32.506
-NAOMI.
-NAOMI?

04:32.540 --> 04:34.708
OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.
I'M JUST--

04:34.742 --> 04:37.645
THAT'S NICE TO REKINDLE
AN OLD FRIENDSHIP,

04:37.678 --> 04:41.048
BUT I JUST-- I HEARD
SHE'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT

04:41.081 --> 04:44.318
-THAN SHE USED TO BE, SO--
-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

04:44.352 --> 04:46.387
UH, I JUST HEARD
SHE'S A LITTLE MORE

04:46.420 --> 04:49.823
LIKE A MOM THAN
A SEXY HOT CHEERLEADER.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.059
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO HAVE FUN ANYWAY.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.428
YOU KNOW SHE USED TO BE--
SHE USED TO BE OUT
OF MY LEAGUE,

04:54.462 --> 04:58.366
BUT, NOW, I THINK
I CAN HANDLE HER.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.668
WOW, LOOK AT YOU.

05:00.701 --> 05:03.103
PLAYBOY STEVENS, RIGHT?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.072
I'M JUST SAYING--
DON'T GO HOME WITH HER

05:05.105 --> 05:08.709
UNLESS YOU ARE READY TO PLAY
"LEGO CITY" OR "POKÉMON"

05:08.742 --> 05:10.478
OR "DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS."

05:10.511 --> 05:11.912
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW
THESE GAMES?

05:13.847 --> 05:16.717
I JUST-- I DON'T KNOW.
THERE'S COMMERCIALS.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.353
YOU DON'T SEE TOYS "R" US
COMMERCIALS?

05:19.387 --> 05:20.654
ANYWAYS.

05:20.688 --> 05:23.557
WOW! THAT'S PERFECT!
IT REALLY IS.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.393
DON'T JUDGE.
IT'S VERY ADDICTING.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.562
ALL RIGHT. I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU TOMORROW.

05:28.596 --> 05:29.930
I WILL SEE YOU
TOMORROW, AS WELL.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.064
COOL.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.546
HAVE YOU KEPT IN TOUCH
WITH ANYONE FROM COLLEGE?

06:18.579 --> 06:19.647
OH, YEAH.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.014
DO YOU REMEMBER
NICK PHILLIPS?

06:21.048 --> 06:23.751
YEAH. NOW, HE KNOWS
HOW TO THROW A PARTY.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.053
I MEAN THE ATMOSPHERE
WAS SO WILD,

06:26.086 --> 06:29.056
LIKE YOU JUST KNEW YOU WERE
GOING HOME WITH SOMEONE.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.691
EXCUSE ME?

06:30.724 --> 06:32.059
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.595
NICK PHILLIPS
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MY FIRST

06:34.628 --> 06:36.697
AND MY SECOND CHILD.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.066
- WELL, I GUESS THAT'S
- WHY HE HAS
HIS OWN BILLBOARD.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.679
-MMM.
-YOU LOOK AS GOOD
AS I REMEMBER.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.682
THANK YOU.
IT'S GENETICS.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.718
YEAH, YOUR MOTHER
WAS A NICE LOOKING WOMAN.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.953
YOU LOOKING
AT MY MAMA? HUH?

06:59.987 --> 07:02.490
I WILL SLICE YOUR THROAT.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.124
UM.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.693
OH.

07:05.726 --> 07:10.230
SORRY, SORRY.
I WAS JUST JOKING.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.601
ANYWAY, I'M GLAD
YOU ASKED ME OUT.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.503
WITH THE KIDS,
I DON'T GET OUT VERY MUCH.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.605
I SEE.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.773
THIS IS MY FIRST DATE
IN TWO YEARS.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.709
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

07:21.742 --> 07:25.846
I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD
CALL THIS A DATE.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.981
THERE WE GO.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.855
YOU'RE JUST--
YOU'RE GONNA FLOSS?

07:34.888 --> 07:35.989
OW.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.592
OKAY.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.961
-LOOK AT THAT ONE.
-OH, YEAH.

07:40.994 --> 07:44.832
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.099
IT KEEPS ME
FROM GETTING FAT.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.501
AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT
I WOULD GET FAT,

07:47.535 --> 07:49.136
BECAUSE OF THE KIDS,
YOU KNOW?

07:49.169 --> 07:50.738
BUT SINCE
I'VE STARTED FLOSSING,

07:50.771 --> 07:52.239
I DON'T GET
THE EXTRA WEIGHT

07:52.272 --> 07:55.075
THAT COMES FROM THE FOOD
THAT COMES OUT WHEN YOU SLEEP.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.044
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT YOU'RE
NOT GONNA GAIN WEIGHT

07:57.077 --> 07:59.212
FROM THE FOOD
THAT COMES OUT AT NIGHT.

07:59.246 --> 08:02.082
OH, NO, IT'S A THING.
I SAW IT ON YOUTUBE, SO--

08:02.115 --> 08:07.087
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU CAN
JUST DO THAT IN THE RESTROOM.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.023
I KNOW, BUT I'M NOT
FINISHED EATING.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.892
I JUST WANTED TO TAKE
A HALFTIME BREAK,

08:11.925 --> 08:13.527
CLEAN MY MOUTH OUT
BEFORE THE BIG FINISH.

08:13.561 --> 08:14.795
GOT IT.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.964
I'M GOING BACK
FOR SECONDS LATER.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.231
-YOU GONNA EAT THAT?
-NO.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.601
OH, GREAT.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.637
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THE FOOD IS SO GOOD HERE.

08:26.339 --> 08:30.243
OH, MY GOSH!
UH! DELICIOUS!

08:30.277 --> 08:32.746
I DON'T EAT
THE CROUTONS THOUGH,

08:32.780 --> 08:34.014
'CAUSE THESE ARE GARLIC.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.282
YOU DON'T WANT GARLIC
IN YOUR HOO-HA,

08:35.315 --> 08:36.583
MAKE YOU STINKY.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.251
-YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
-GOT IT.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.621
GROSS.

08:40.654 --> 08:41.822
THIS IS GOOD.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.124
AND THE CHICKEN BREAST,
OH, MY GOD.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.627
THE CHICKEN BREAST, PROTEIN,
IT'S GOOD FOR YA.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.295
MMM.

08:48.328 --> 08:51.198
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR MY FINAL FLOSS.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.901
OH, GREAT.
PERFECT.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.803
-I'M GONNA--
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
-OKAY.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.571
-DON'T MISS ME TOO MUCH.
-HMM-MM, NOT AT ALL.

08:57.605 --> 09:01.575
MMM, I JUST WOULD LIKE
A TALL DRINK

09:01.609 --> 09:03.911
OF MILK CHOCOLATE.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.313
I'M GONNA EAT YOU UP.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.050
OH, GOD.

09:14.121 --> 09:17.090
DO YOU HAVE A MIRROR
IN YOUR PANTS?

09:17.124 --> 09:21.261
-I'M WEARING A DRESS.
-BECAUSE I CAN SEE MYSELF
IN THERE.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.831
OH. OKAY.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.166
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
JUST SKIP THE DESSERT,

09:26.199 --> 09:30.604
'CAUSE I WANNA CLIMB
THOSE PILLARS TONIGHT.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.239
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

09:32.272 --> 09:33.340
WOW, OKAY.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.809
THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU?

09:35.843 --> 09:37.144
A FRIEND OF MINE TOLD ME
THAT THAT WOULD

09:37.177 --> 09:38.979
TOTALLY SEAL THE DEAL.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.814
HEY!

09:40.848 --> 09:42.182
OH, MY GOSH!

09:42.215 --> 09:43.316
THIS IS MY BROTHER.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.885
WOW.

09:44.918 --> 09:48.989
OH, MY GOD.
WE THOUGHT HE DIED IN IRAQ.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.758
DIFFERENT DADS.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.225
- OH.
- YEAH.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.095
UM...

09:55.128 --> 09:57.397
I'M GONNA CELEBRATE
MY BROTHER BEING ALIVE.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.133
SO, THANK YOU FOR THIS...

10:00.167 --> 10:02.102
WHATEVER THIS WAS.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.671
IT WAS GREAT.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.907
I'M GONNA CALL YOU.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.976
OKAY.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.081
SORRY, I HAD
TO GET OUT OF THERE.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.717
NO PROBLEM.
LOOKS LIKE WE BOTH
HAD A BAD NIGHT.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.786
OH, RIGHT.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.988
OH, SORRY ABOUT
THE CROUTON THING.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.656
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

10:22.690 --> 10:25.793
IT'S OKAY.
I'VE BEEN HIT BY WORSE.

10:25.826 --> 10:26.960
HI.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.328
-I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
-THANKS.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.864
-SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
-WHAT?

10:30.898 --> 10:32.332
YOU SAID YOU WERE HIT
BY, LIKE, A MAN?

10:32.365 --> 10:34.001
NO.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.203
I WAS AT THIS PIZZA JOINT
ONE NIGHT, AND I GUESS

10:36.236 --> 10:37.771
THEY HIRED A NEW GUY
TO FLIP PIZZAS,

10:37.805 --> 10:40.173
AND HE JUST FLIPPED ONE
RIGHT INTO MY FACE.

10:40.207 --> 10:43.376
IT'S WEIRD. OBJECTS ARE
JUST ATTRACTED TO MY FACE.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.245
THAT CAME OFF WRONG.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.380
THOMAS?

10:47.414 --> 10:50.017
HI, BABY, I HEARD
YOU WERE BACK IN TOWN.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.418
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET A HOLD OF YOU.

10:51.451 --> 10:54.187
UH, I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.724
WELL, THIS ISN'T THE TIME
OR PLACE FOR IT.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.458
THOMAS,
I KNOW I HURT YOU.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.459
HURT ME.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.262
WHAT DO YOU WANT, CORI?

11:02.295 --> 11:04.865
I JUST WANNA SAY I'M SORRY.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.299
THERE IS NOTHING
THAT I WOULDN'T DO

11:06.333 --> 11:08.301
TO CHANGE THE MOMENT
WHEN I WALKED OUT ON YOU.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.872
WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE,
I MOVED ON.

11:11.905 --> 11:15.008
OH, SO YOU'VE ADDED
A LITTLE MILK

11:15.042 --> 11:19.747
TO YOUR HOT CHOCOLATE,
I SEE.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.248
I LOVE YOU.

11:27.220 --> 11:30.190
CORI, THIS ISN'T THE TIME!

11:30.223 --> 11:33.026
PUMPKIN,
I THOUGHT I SAW YOUR NAME
ON AN EVICTION NOTICE.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.932
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

11:40.100 --> 11:43.036
HOLD ON!
YOU LEAVING ALREADY?

11:43.070 --> 11:44.805
I DIDN'T EVEN GET NO DESSERT.

11:44.838 --> 11:45.939
DAMN, I'M TIRED.

11:45.973 --> 11:47.941
YOU AIN'T HUNGRY?

11:47.975 --> 11:49.977
COME ON, AT LEAST GIVE US SOME
TIRAMISU WITH SOME FLAN.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.912
WHAT'S ALL YOUR RUSH ANYWAY?

11:51.945 --> 11:53.446
WHO IS THIS?

12:16.970 --> 12:18.939
OKAY, THOMAS, EDUCATE ME.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.308
OKAY, $222

12:21.341 --> 12:24.344
THAT'S TWO $100 BILLS,
MY FAVORITE,

12:24.377 --> 12:27.881
ONE $20 BILL,
AND TWO ONE DOLLAR BILLS.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.516
THAT'S RIGHT.

12:29.549 --> 12:33.921
-NOW INSPIRE ME.
-YOU GOT IT.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.188

12:41.128 --> 12:44.364
-NOW SERVE ME.
-OKAY.

12:44.397 --> 12:45.999
I'LL KEEP THAT
FOR YOU, MISS.

12:46.033 --> 12:50.270
OH, GOOD JOB, BABY.

12:50.303 --> 12:54.374
YOU KNOW, ONE DAY,
THIS PLACE IS GOING
TO BE YOURS.

12:54.407 --> 12:57.010
AND, SO, I GET TO EAT

12:57.044 --> 12:59.312
UH, NO, BUT YOU CAN SELL
ALL OF THE CUPCAKES

12:59.346 --> 13:00.948

AMAZING CUSTOMERS.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.350
BUT THEN I'LL MAKE MORE

13:03.383 --> 13:04.985
COME HERE.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.820

ON YOUR OWN SUPPLY,
THOMAS.

13:06.854 --> 13:10.290
-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
-NOTHING.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.925
NOW GET YOUR STUFF,
SO WE CAN GET YOU HOME

13:11.959 --> 13:15.162

I RECORDED IT.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.268

16:04.097 --> 16:05.432

STANDPOINT?

16:16.443 --> 16:18.611

16:18.645 --> 16:21.348

16:21.381 --> 16:23.550
THEY NEED MORE MONEY,
OR THEY'RE GONNA SHUT US DOWN.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.685
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THEY WANT MORE MONEY?

16:25.718 --> 16:27.620

I'VE MISSED YOU.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.415
IS THAT WHAT
YOU CALL FLIRTING?

21:22.449 --> 21:23.583
OH, MY GOD.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.418
I'M ALYSSA STOCK.

21:25.452 --> 21:26.619
ALYSSA STOCK.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.321
GOOD TO PUT A NAME
WITH A FACE.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.590
I DIDN'T CATCH IT LAST NIGHT
AT THE RESTAURANT.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.525
I'M THOMAS,
FROM THE TKS FOUNDATION.

21:32.559 --> 21:35.428
AND I'M BELLA JOBS.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.597
MY GUY FRIENDS CALL ME BJ.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.698
YEAH.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.000
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING?

21:41.033 --> 21:42.101
-OR YOU?
-NICK.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.670
-HI.
-HI.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.838
UH, NOT WITH THE FOUNDATION.
JUST A FRIEND.

21:45.872 --> 21:48.641
I THINK I KNOW YOU
FROM SOMEWHERE, ACTUALLY.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.043
WELL, I DO HAVE
BILLBOARDS AROUND TOWN.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.445
NO BIG DEAL.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.681
NO, I THINK WE WORK OUT
AT THE SAME GYM.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.683
DO YOU WORK OUT
AT CROSSFIT GRANDVIEW?

21:56.716 --> 21:58.117
-YEAH.
-MM-HMM.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.387
YOU'RE THAT
CLUB PROMOTER GUY, RIGHT?

22:00.420 --> 22:01.888
EVENT PLANNER.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.657
CLUB PROMOTING
CAN BE VERY LIMITING.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.125
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE?
GOT IT.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.829
THERE'S-- THERE IS.
IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE, SO--

22:09.862 --> 22:11.664
WELL, ANYWAY, CAN I GET
EITHER OF YOU SOMETHING?

22:11.698 --> 22:13.900
-A CUPCAKE, MAYBE?
-NO, THANK YOU.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.668
YEAH! I WOULD LOVE
A CUPCAKE.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.370
-RED VELVET.
-MM-HMM.

22:17.404 --> 22:21.674
-IT'S MY FAVORITE.
-I KNOW IT'S YOUR FAVORITE.

22:21.708 --> 22:24.477
IT'S ON US.

22:24.511 --> 22:25.678
LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND.

22:25.712 --> 22:28.581
- GREAT.
- OKAY, COME ON.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.082
DO YOU WANT SOME COMPANY?

22:30.116 --> 22:33.152
NO, I THINK YOU CAN
HOLD DOWN THE FORT.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.121
CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME.

22:35.154 --> 22:39.025
I'LL JUST--
I'LL WAIT OVER HERE
TILL YOU'RE DONE.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.927
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
IF I PUT THE FINAL TOUCHES

22:40.960 --> 22:42.929
ON MY CAKES
WHILE WE TALK.

22:42.962 --> 22:45.031
NOT AT ALL.

22:45.064 --> 22:48.134
SO TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF.

22:48.167 --> 22:50.437
WELL, FIRST OFF,
I JUST WANT TO SAY

22:50.470 --> 22:53.906
I'M REALLY EXCITED
TO BE A SEMI-FINALIST
FOR YOUR GRANT.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.909
WELL, WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING
TO SUPPORT BAKERIES

22:56.943 --> 22:59.679
THAT HAVE SEPARATED
THEMSELVES FROM THE PACK

22:59.712 --> 23:02.582
BY SERVING OTHER,
NOT JUST IN THE BAKERIES,

23:02.615 --> 23:04.050
BUT ALSO IN THE COMMUNITY.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.085
I'VE RUN THE BUSINESS
SINCE I WAS 22 YEARS OLD.

23:06.118 --> 23:09.021
IT WAS PASSED DOWN
FROM MY GRANDMOTHER.

23:09.055 --> 23:12.058
HOW DID YOUR GRANDMOTHER
ACQUIRE THE PLACE?

23:12.091 --> 23:14.861
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW.

23:14.894 --> 23:18.598
-I NEVER REALLY ASKED HER.
-REALLY? OKAY.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.633
WELL, IF YOU DON'T
MIND ME ASKING,

23:20.667 --> 23:22.535
DID YOU COME
FROM MONEY, OR?

23:22.569 --> 23:27.139
UM... I MEAN,
WE WERE YOUR TYPICAL
MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.841
WE DIDN'T LIVE
PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK,
OR ANYTHING,

23:28.875 --> 23:31.410
BUT WE COULDN'T
AFFORD NOT TO WORK.

23:33.212 --> 23:34.681
YOU?

23:36.616 --> 23:38.651
I THINK WE SHOULD
JUST FOCUS ON WHY I'M HERE.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.019
WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE
CHARITIES?

23:40.052 --> 23:42.021
-THE TKS FOUNDATION.
-MMM.

23:42.054 --> 23:45.024
-OBVIOUSLY.
-REALLY?

23:45.057 --> 23:47.827
NO, MY GRANDMOTHER
WAS A BIG SPORTS FAN, SO--

23:47.860 --> 23:49.629
IT'S KINDA HARD NOT
TO BE IN THIS TOWN.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.130
SO WE REALLY--

23:51.163 --> 23:53.132
WE SUPPORT
THE SECOND AND SEVEN
FOUNDATION,

23:53.165 --> 23:55.802
THE DRIVEN FOUNDATION,
MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY'RE RAN

23:55.835 --> 23:57.770
BY FORMER
FOOTBALL PLAYERS.

23:57.804 --> 24:01.140
TELL ME SOMETHING
I CAN'T READ ON THE WEBSITE.

24:01.173 --> 24:03.943
I MEAN,
WHY WASN'T IT PASSED
TO YOUR MOTHER?

24:03.976 --> 24:05.778
UM...

24:05.812 --> 24:09.682
SHE DIED WHEN I WAS 16.

24:09.716 --> 24:12.652
-I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
-THANK YOU.

24:14.787 --> 24:18.625
SO, WHAT MAKES THIS PLACE
SPECIAL TO YOU?

24:18.658 --> 24:20.493
I MEAN, WHY SHOULD
WE GIVE YOU $100,000,

24:20.527 --> 24:21.828
AND WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO WITH IT?

24:21.861 --> 24:25.832
I THINK MY CAKES
KINDA SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.

24:25.865 --> 24:29.168
TRY ONE.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.870
NO, THANK YOU, THOUGH.

24:30.903 --> 24:34.774
ONE CUPCAKE WON'T
MAKE YOU FAT. I PROMISE.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.076
NEXT TIME.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.878
MAYBE.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.780
-COME ON,
I'LL SHOW YOU AROUND.
-ALL RIGHT.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.949
RIGHT THIS WAY.

24:44.784 --> 24:48.955
HEY, YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE.
YOU GOT TO GO.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.891
HEY, FRED, HI.

24:51.924 --> 24:53.693
-HERE YOU GO.
-THANKS, ALYSSA.

24:53.726 --> 24:56.062
YOU'RE WELCOME.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.631
I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN TOMORROW.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.600
BYE.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.936
THAT'S FRED.
HE THINKS OUR CUPCAKES
ARE PRETTY GREAT.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.304
SO DO I.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.574
ACTUALLY, THEY'RE VOTED
THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY.

25:07.607 --> 25:08.808
IN THE COUNTRY?

25:08.841 --> 25:10.710
-THAT'S RIGHT.
-EXCUSE ME.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.144
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE BATHROOM IS?

25:12.178 --> 25:15.247
I KNOW WHERE IT IS.
COME ON.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.583
COME ON!

25:18.618 --> 25:20.920
SO, I MEAN, I GUESS
IF THEY'RE THE BEST
IN THE COUNTRY,

25:20.953 --> 25:22.855
I SHOULD TASTE ONE, HUH?

25:22.889 --> 25:24.557
FINALLY.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.025
WHAT KIND WOULD YOU LIKE?

25:26.058 --> 25:27.994
-WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE?
-DO YOU HAVE COOKIE DOUGH?

25:28.027 --> 25:29.295
I DO.

25:29.328 --> 25:31.798
IT'S MY FAVORITE, TOO,

25:31.831 --> 25:34.133
I REMEMBER
MY MOM USED TO--

25:37.336 --> 25:39.606
LET'S TASTE IT.

25:47.146 --> 25:51.250
-WOW.
-TOLD YA.

25:51.283 --> 25:54.186
THOSE ARE FROM HER GRANNY'S
SECRET RECIPE.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.925
I MEAN, THAT'S A LIE.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.960
RIGHT?

26:00.993 --> 26:03.930
'CAUSE I'VE TASTED
THOSE EXACT CUPCAKES BEFORE,

26:03.963 --> 26:05.865
SO SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GET
THEIR FACTS STRAIGHT.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.034
EXCUSE ME?

26:08.067 --> 26:11.771
I'M NOT TRYING
TO BE DISRESPECTFUL
OR ANYTHING, MISS STOCK,

26:11.804 --> 26:13.773
BUT I CAN TELL YOU
FOR A FACT

26:13.806 --> 26:15.007
THAT'S NOT YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S
SECRET RECIPE.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.610
AND HOW WOULD
YOU KNOW THIS, MISTER...

26:17.644 --> 26:18.945
WHAT, DID YOU JUST
APPLY FOR A GRANT

26:18.978 --> 26:20.346
AND DIDN'T DO RESEARCH
ON THE COMPANY

26:20.379 --> 26:24.651
THAT YOU EXPECTED
TO GIVE YOU $100,000?

26:24.684 --> 26:26.185
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.227
NO MEANS NO.

26:35.261 --> 26:38.631
I LIKE YOUR CUPCAKES.
TOMMY, WAIT UP!

26:38.665 --> 26:41.901
WHAT HAPPENED?

26:41.934 --> 26:45.004
WHAT DID HE SAY?

26:45.037 --> 26:47.139
SHE'S WAS GONNA TRY
TO SAY THAT THAT'S

26:47.173 --> 26:49.208
HER GRANDMOTHER'S
SECRET RECIPE.

26:49.241 --> 26:51.978
I TASTED THOSE CUPCAKES
EVERY DAY AS A KID.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.981
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

26:55.014 --> 26:58.417
BABE'S BAKERY,
THAT BABE'S BAKERY.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.787
THAT WAS MY MOM'S BAKERY

27:00.820 --> 27:03.255
BEFORE HER GRANDMOTHER
STOLE IT FROM HER.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.824
YOU KNOW WHAT,
WHAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW

27:04.857 --> 27:06.993
IS I KNOW SHE'S HAVING
FINANCIAL ISSUES.

27:07.026 --> 27:09.161
WHICH MEANS SHE HAS
NO CONSISTENT CLIENTELE,

27:09.195 --> 27:12.231
OR SHE'S GOT
SOME KIND OF HABIT.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.734
-A HABIT?
-YEP.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.102
-WHAT KIND OF HABIT?
-I DON'T KNOW.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.404
DRUGS, GAMBLING,
SOMETHING.

27:18.437 --> 27:20.907
UH... THAT GIRL?

27:20.940 --> 27:22.675
COME ON, MAN,
LOOK AT HER.

27:22.709 --> 27:24.376
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A HABIT.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.078
IN MY LINE OF BUSINESS,

27:26.112 --> 27:28.214
I CAN SPOT THAT
FROM A MILE AWAY.

27:28.247 --> 27:31.350
HER FRIEND,
ON THE OTHER HAND...

27:31.383 --> 27:33.886
SHE'S PROBABLY
GOT SOME HABITS.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.388
SO, YOU TWO KNOW
EACH OTHER, AS WELL?

27:36.422 --> 27:38.290
YEAH, I'VE SEEN
HER AROUND.

27:42.929 --> 27:44.263
ALL RIGHT,
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO

27:44.296 --> 27:46.665
WHEN I WAS SMASHING
ANYTHING THAT WALKED.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.401
SO, IS SHE STILL
IN THE RUNNING

27:49.435 --> 27:51.237
FOR THE GRANT?

27:51.270 --> 27:53.172
I DON'T KNOW.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.407
I MEAN, ANY
OF THE SEMI-FINALISTS
COULD GET THIS GRANT.

27:55.441 --> 27:59.045
I NEED TO MAKE SURE
MY MOM'S NAME DON'T
GO IN VEIN.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.913
YOU NEED
TO GIVE HER A CHANCE.

28:00.947 --> 28:02.849
PERSONALLY, I DON'T
EVEN THINK SHE KNOWS

28:02.882 --> 28:04.717
WHAT HER GRANDMOTHER
DID TO YOUR MOM.

28:04.751 --> 28:08.487
AND MAYBE, MAYBE THIS
IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY

28:08.520 --> 28:11.057
FOR YOU TO FIND OUT AND SEE.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.391
I DON'T KNOW.

28:12.424 --> 28:15.194
I THINK YOUR MOM
WOULD HAVE LIKED HER.

28:15.227 --> 28:18.330
SHE'S SMART.
SHE'S PASSIONATE.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.799
SHE CARES
ABOUT THE COMMUNITY.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.934
SHE'S BROKE,
IS WHAT SHE IS.

28:21.968 --> 28:25.071
THE TKS FOUNDATION
WAS STARTED TO INSPIRE,
EDUCATE, AND SERVE.

28:25.104 --> 28:28.074
COME ON, YOU GOTTA
GET BACK ON THE HORSE.

28:28.107 --> 28:30.442
SHE'S SMART.
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,

28:30.476 --> 28:32.244
AND SHE'S IN TO YOU.

28:32.278 --> 28:35.982
HONESTLY, THE ONLY DRAWBACK
IS HER CANNIBALISTIC FRIEND.

28:36.015 --> 28:38.885
THOSE CUPCAKES
BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.519
AND BELIEVE ME,
I THINK SHE WANTS
TO GIVE YOU

28:40.552 --> 28:41.520
SOME MORE
OF THOSE CUPCAKES

28:41.553 --> 28:43.055
IN MORE THAN ONE WAY.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.323
I GIVE THE PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.158
-I BET YOU DO.
-YEAH.

28:46.192 --> 28:49.095
IT'S A GOOD BET.
YOU'RE GONNA WIN
THAT EVERY TIME NOW.

28:49.128 --> 28:50.496
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.464
HEY! HEY!
WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

29:09.281 --> 29:12.919
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OH, WAIT, LET ME GUESS.

29:12.952 --> 29:14.186
SITTING AT HOME
WITH YOU FEET IN PAJAMAS

29:14.220 --> 29:16.188
EATING COOKIE DOUGH
ICE CREAM, HUH?

29:16.222 --> 29:18.324
ACTUALLY, IT'S A LITTLE
TOO WARM FOR THE ONES
WITH THE FEET IN THEM.

29:18.357 --> 29:21.127
UGH, SERIOUSLY, IT'S BEEN
LIKE A COUPLE DAYS

29:21.160 --> 29:22.194
SINCE THAT MEETING
WITH THE FOUNDATION,

29:22.228 --> 29:24.797
ARE YOU STILL DOWN ABOUT THAT?

29:24.831 --> 29:27.566
I MEAN, I COULD HAVE
REALLY USED THE MONEY,
SO YEAH.

29:27.599 --> 29:28.868
WELL, MAYBE
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

29:28.901 --> 29:30.102
OKAY, JUST
CALL HIM BACK.

29:30.136 --> 29:31.570
NO, I'M PRETTY SURE
HE HATES ME.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.006
OH, HE DEFINITELY HATED YOU,
BUT LOOK AT IT THIS WAY,

29:34.040 --> 29:36.308
I MEAN IT'S NOT
LIKE BUSINESS IS DOING BAD,

29:36.342 --> 29:39.411
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
REALLY NEED THE MONEY.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.282
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
JUST TRY AND BONE HIM.

29:43.315 --> 29:46.418
I KNOW YOU FELT
THAT TINGLY FEELING
WHEN HE CAME IN.

29:46.452 --> 29:47.586
ARE YOU OKAY?

29:47.619 --> 29:49.856
MM-HMM.
FINE.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.123
-I'M GONNA GO BACK
TO WATCHING TV--

29:51.157 --> 29:52.591
NO! WE HAVE TO DO BETTER.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.493
OKAY, YOU SHOULD COME OUT
WITH ME TONIGHT.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.362
THERE'S GONNA BE
A LOT OF HORNY DRUNK MEN.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.030
YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.565
OKAY, SERIOUSLY,
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

29:59.598 --> 30:01.033
THAT LITTLE THING
THAT YOU'RE USING AT HOME

30:01.067 --> 30:02.501
IS NOT LIKE
THE REAL THING.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.336
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.338
OKAY.

30:06.372 --> 30:10.442
ANOTHER NIGHT OF SHOTS
AND WALK OF SHAME AT
6:00 AM FOR ME.

30:10.476 --> 30:13.312
OKAY. I GOTTA GO.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.547
AW, SHIT.

30:15.581 --> 30:19.919
OH, MY GOD,
THAT IS RANCID,

30:19.952 --> 30:22.521
WHAT DID I EAT?
JESUS.

30:35.534 --> 30:38.204
OH, MY GOSH.

30:38.237 --> 30:39.338
NO.

30:45.144 --> 30:47.947
-SO HOW WAS LAST NIGHT?
-UH, WELL, LET'S JUST SAY,

30:47.980 --> 30:50.082
WHOEVER SAID,
"IT'S NOT THE SIZE
OF THE BOAT,

30:50.116 --> 30:51.918
BUT THE MOTION
IN THE OCEAN" LIED.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.219
AT LEAST YOU GET BOAT.

30:53.252 --> 30:56.588
IT WAS LIKE A LIFE RAFT.
WITHOUT A PADDLE.

30:56.622 --> 30:59.091
IT WAS TINY.
IT WAS LIKE A FLOATIE.

30:59.125 --> 31:00.426
OOH, BABE'S BAKERY
IN THE HOUSE.

31:00.459 --> 31:04.030
HEY!
WELL, HOW DID
THEY GET HERE?

31:04.063 --> 31:05.531
JUST LET--
LET'S JUST GO.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.666
GO? GO WHERE?
WE'RE HERE TO WORK OUT.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.236
HEY! MAYBE
THIS IS A SIGN

31:10.269 --> 31:11.370
THAT YOU SHOULD
GIVE HER THE GRANT.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.671
SHE'S NOT GETTING
THE GRANT,

31:12.704 --> 31:14.306
SO IF THAT WAS YOUR PLAN,
THEN WE CAN LEAVE.

31:14.340 --> 31:15.541
OKAY, WHOA, CALM DOWN.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.143
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE
GONNA BE HERE.

31:17.176 --> 31:20.212
LET'S JUST GO WORK OUT.

31:20.246 --> 31:21.613
-ALL RIGHT.
-WHOO!

31:21.647 --> 31:23.149
DID I HEAR SOMEONE
SAY "CALM DOWN"?

31:23.182 --> 31:25.684
COME ON, GUYS!
CROSSFIT. THIS IS MY DOJO.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.020
WELCOME, LET'S GO.
COME ON! WE'LL PUT THE SWEAT
IN THOSE PECS,

31:28.054 --> 31:29.521
ALL RIGHT?
COME ON.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.490
AH, LADIES, IT'S TONE TIME,
SO IF YOU WANNA JOIN US?

31:31.523 --> 31:33.392
HERE WE GO.
WE GOT EIGHT MINUTES

31:33.425 --> 31:35.027
TO KNOCK OUT
THIS WOD, HONUS.

31:35.061 --> 31:37.063
EIGHT MINUTES STARTS NOW!

31:37.096 --> 31:39.098
NOW!

31:39.131 --> 31:40.566
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE?

31:40.599 --> 31:43.202
THIS PLACE ISN'T BIG ENOUGH
FOR THE FOUR OF US.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.471
WHAT? IT'S PLENTY BIG.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.307
BELLA, RIGHT?

31:48.340 --> 31:51.510
YOU REMEMBERED.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.212
I JUST WANNA
APOLOGIZE TO YOU

31:53.245 --> 31:54.680
AND TO YOU,
MISS STOCK.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.415
I DO NOT WANT MY ACTIONS
FROM THE OTHER DAY

31:56.448 --> 31:58.084
TO BE REFLECTED
ON THE FOUNDATION.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.986
I TOLD YOU HE WAS DREAMY.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.487
IF I KNEW YOU
WERE GONNA BE HERE,

32:01.520 --> 32:03.655
I WOULD HAVE WORN
MY SEE-THROUGH WORKOUT PANTS.

32:03.689 --> 32:06.092
DID I TELL YOU TO STOP?
THERE'S NO STOPPING.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.593
CONTINUE.

32:09.996 --> 32:11.263
I COMPLETELY AGREE,
MR. STEVENS,

32:11.297 --> 32:12.999
I THINK WE GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.700
IF YOU WANNA COME BACK,
I CAN SHOW YOU A DETAILED PLAN

32:14.733 --> 32:17.403
OF WHAT I INTEND ON DOING
WITH THE MONEY FROM THE GRANT.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.138
AND WE ARE DONE.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.339
TIME MOVE ON
TO THE NEXT STATION.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.408
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
SQUATS.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.391
WHOO!

33:12.424 --> 33:14.426
MAN, I AM TIRED.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.629
LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE, TOO.

33:19.165 --> 33:20.566
-SOME WATER?
-YES, THANK YOU.

33:20.599 --> 33:23.135
GIVE ME ONE MORE SECOND.

33:25.371 --> 33:28.407
HERE YOU GO.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.741
I THOUGHT THE BOTTLE
WAS GONNA SQUIRT ON YOU,

33:29.775 --> 33:31.710
SO I OPENED IT.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.048
THANK YOU.

33:38.317 --> 33:40.152
SO, UM, SO LET'S
SET UP A MEETING

33:40.186 --> 33:41.487
TO DISCUSS WHAT YOU WOULD
DO WITH THE GRANT,

33:41.520 --> 33:43.389
IF WE CHOSE YOU.

33:43.422 --> 33:44.723
YEAH?

33:44.756 --> 33:46.492
TELL ME WHEN.

33:46.525 --> 33:51.130
WELL, I AM BUSY
ALL AFTERNOON,

33:51.163 --> 33:54.466
BUT I'M AVAILABLE FOR DINNER,
IF THAT WORKS FOR YOU.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.302
SOUNDS GREAT.

33:58.204 --> 34:00.572
LET ME KNOW WHEN.
CALL ME.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.374
-I'LL CALL YOU.
-OKAY.

34:02.408 --> 34:05.344
-I'LL WAIT FOR IT.
-WILL YOU? GREAT.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.045
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

34:12.251 --> 34:15.121
MRS. RAISIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR AGREEING TO MEET ME

34:15.154 --> 34:16.188
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.556
THE ONLY REASON
I MADE TIME

34:17.589 --> 34:19.591
IS BECAUSE YOU ARE
THERESA STEVENS' SON.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.193
YOU KNEW MY MOTHER?

34:21.226 --> 34:23.562
YES, WE WERE
HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS.

34:23.594 --> 34:25.496
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE HER.

34:25.531 --> 34:28.134
-SO WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH?
-LIKE I SAID ON THE PHONE,

34:28.167 --> 34:31.337
ALYSSA STOCK,
SHE'S IN THE RUNNING
FOR OUR $100,000 GRANT,

34:31.370 --> 34:33.272
AND I KNOW SHE USED TO BE
ONE OF YOUR TOP DONORS,

34:33.304 --> 34:35.674
BUT OVER THE LAST YEAR,
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SHE'S GIVEN

34:35.706 --> 34:38.444
TO YOU OR ANY OTHER
ORGANIZATIONS.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.346
DO YOU KNOW WHY ALL
OF A SUDDEN SHE STOPPED?

34:40.379 --> 34:42.414
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MISS STOCK
IS DOING WITH HER MONEY,

34:42.447 --> 34:44.382
BUT AS FAR AS KEEPING
THE INTEGRITY

34:44.416 --> 34:48.687
OF WHAT YOUR MOTHER STARTED,
SHE'S RIGHT IN LINE.

34:48.719 --> 34:49.821
THANKS.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.269
I KNOW IT MIGHT
SOUND WEIRD,

35:03.302 --> 35:04.636
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD REDECORATE
THE BAKERY.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.738
WHY NOT? I MEAN,
IT'S AN OLDER BUILDING,

35:06.772 --> 35:08.874
SO YOU KINDA
HAVE TO KEEP IT
BRIGHT AND SHINY

35:08.907 --> 35:11.710
-TO MAKE IT STAND OUT.
-YEAH, BUT, THERE'S SO MUCH
CHARACTER TO IT.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.412
I MEAN, YOUR GRANDMOTHER
DIDN'T REDECORATE,

35:13.445 --> 35:15.247
NEITHER DID THE PERSON
BEFORE HER.

35:15.281 --> 35:18.184
TRUE, BUT I DON'T THINK
MY GRANNY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

35:18.217 --> 35:20.719
TO GET $100,000.

35:20.752 --> 35:23.489
I WANNA INSPIRE,
AND EDUCATE, AND SERVE.

35:23.522 --> 35:27.426
HMM. YOU'VE BEEN
DOING YOUR HOMEWORK, I SEE.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.928
YOU KNOW, I REALLY ENVISION
TAKING IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.264
YOU KNOW, I WANNA OPEN UP
MULTIPLE LOCATIONS

35:32.298 --> 35:36.168
AND REALLY SPREAD
MY GRANDMOTHER'S ESSENCE
BEYOND COLUMBUS.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.669
IS THERE ANY OTHER LOCATION,
IN PARTICULAR,

35:37.703 --> 35:41.207
-THAT YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE?
-I DON'T KNOW.

35:41.240 --> 35:44.476
I GUESS, I'VE NEVER REALLY
BEEN OUTSIDE OF OHIO,

35:44.510 --> 35:45.744
SO IT'S HARD TO SAY,

35:45.777 --> 35:47.646
BUT NO,
I REALLY SEE SPREADING

35:47.679 --> 35:50.516
MY GRANDMOTHER'S NAME
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.784
YEAH, BABE'S BAKERY
IS A SPECIAL PLACE.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.854
MM-HMM.

35:55.887 --> 35:57.756
SO, CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG,

35:57.789 --> 36:00.526
BUT I THINK THE LAST TIME
I SAW YOU OUT AT A RESTAURANT

36:00.559 --> 36:03.229
YOU WERE PRETENDING THAT I WAS
YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND.

36:03.262 --> 36:05.364
OKAY. LET'S TALK
ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS PLAN.

36:05.397 --> 36:06.865
YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY?

36:06.898 --> 36:10.302
NO. WE WOULDN'T WORK OUT.

36:10.336 --> 36:12.204
OKAY.

36:12.238 --> 36:13.539
I WAS JUST JOKING.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.774
YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN THINGS
YOUR WHOLE LIFE,

36:15.807 --> 36:19.411
AND INSTEAD OF APPRECIATING IT,
YOU WANT TO REDECORATE.

36:19.445 --> 36:21.813
-YOU WANT A CHANGE?
-WHAT?

36:21.847 --> 36:23.915
I WORKED HARD
FOR EVERYTHING I HAVE.

36:23.949 --> 36:27.786
I'VE RUN A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS
BY THE AGE OF 22.

36:27.819 --> 36:29.621
ANYONE CAN RUN
A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS

36:29.655 --> 36:31.323
WHEN IT'S ALREADY
BEEN ESTABLISHED.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.658
YEAH, WELL, NOT EVERYONE
CAN DOUBLE THE PROFITS

36:32.691 --> 36:33.925
WITHIN THE FIRST TWO YEARS
UNLESS THEY HAVE

36:33.959 --> 36:35.627
A LOT OF FAITH
IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

36:35.661 --> 36:37.363
A LOT OF HARD WORK
BACKING IT UP.

36:37.396 --> 36:40.232
I JUST NEED TO BE CERTAIN
MY GRANT GOES TO SOMEONE

36:40.266 --> 36:41.567
WHO HELPS THE COMMUNITY

36:41.600 --> 36:44.270
AND DOESN'T TRY TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THEM.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.272
OKAY, IS THIS EVEN
ABOUT THE GRANT

36:46.305 --> 36:48.307
-OR IS THIS ABOUT
YOUR PERSONAL ISSUES?
-YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.409
I KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH
TO KNOW THAT YOU WERE WILLING

36:50.442 --> 36:52.944
TO PRETEND THAT I WAS
YOUR GIRLFRIEND BEFORE YOU
EVEN KNEW MY NAME.

36:52.978 --> 36:55.281
YOU WERE SO OUT
TO PROVE TO YOUR FIANCÉE
THAT YOU HAD MOVED ON

36:55.314 --> 36:57.583
THAT YOU WERE WILLING
TO BE WITH A WOMAN THAT
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW.

36:57.616 --> 36:59.285
SO WE'RE GONNA
PULL THAT CARD?

36:59.318 --> 37:00.986
AND YOU WERE SO SHALLOW
THAT YOU WERE WILLING TO STAND

37:01.019 --> 37:03.522
IN FRONT OF A RESTAURANT
AND TELL THE DATE

37:03.555 --> 37:05.824
THAT YOU THOUGHT
I WAS YOUR BROTHER
THAT DIED IN A WAR.

37:05.857 --> 37:10.562
GROW UP.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.764
YOU KNOW WHO
I WISH YOU WERE?

37:12.798 --> 37:14.300
I WISH YOU REALLY WERE
MY BROTHER THAT DIED

37:14.333 --> 37:15.734
FIGHTING FOR THIS COUNTRY.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.603
THAT'S WHO I WISH YOU WERE.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.538
THAT'S WHO I WAS
HOPING YOU WERE,

37:19.571 --> 37:21.006
WHICH YOU'LL NEVER BE HIM.

37:24.710 --> 37:27.613
I SHOULD GO.

37:27.646 --> 37:30.349
THANK YOU FOR LOOKING
AT MY BUSINESS PLAN.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.528
CAN I SPEAK
TO ALYSSA, PLEASE?

37:42.561 --> 37:44.530
OH! WHERE'S THE COMMUNITY
SERVICE EVENT AT?

37:44.563 --> 37:46.565
I'D LOVE TO COME
CHECK IT OUT.

37:50.336 --> 37:51.603
WHY ARE YOU RINGING
THE DOORBELL LIKE A MANIAC?

37:51.637 --> 37:54.340
OH, WHAT IS UP,
BUFF BAGWELL?

37:54.373 --> 37:55.907
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
TAKING STEROIDS

37:55.941 --> 37:57.609
-MAKES YOUR PEE-PEE SMALL.
-OH, DOES IT?

37:57.643 --> 37:58.644
-OH!
-DID YOU FEEL THAT?

37:58.677 --> 38:00.379
FEISTY.

38:05.384 --> 38:07.886
HEY, WHY HAVE YOU NOT BEEN
ANSWERING MY CALLS TODAY?

38:07.919 --> 38:10.522
OH, MAN, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I'VE BEEN BUSY ALL DAY

38:10.556 --> 38:12.524
ON THE PHONE WITH THE BOARD
GOING OVER EVALUATIONS.

38:12.558 --> 38:14.460
HMM. ACTUALLY,
I'VE BEEN MEANING

38:14.493 --> 38:16.462
TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THIS.

38:16.495 --> 38:18.997
I've BEEN COOKING UP
SOME REALLY GOOD BROWNIES
IN MY BASEMENT.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.333
MARIJUANA DOESN'T COUNT.

38:21.367 --> 38:23.402
FINE.

38:23.435 --> 38:26.638
ANYWAYS, I'M THROWING
A PARTY OF ALL PARTIES
TONIGHT, MY FRIEND.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.840
-AND YOU, MY FRIEND,
NEED TO GO, SO LET'S GO.
-NO, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.809
I'M SUPER TIRED.
BEEN WORKING ALL DAY.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.811
WHERE YOU GOING?

38:32.844 --> 38:34.646
AH! YEAH, RIGHT.
I'M NOT WEARING THIS.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.415
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THAT'S PERFECT.

38:36.448 --> 38:38.684
YOU'RE 32 YEARS OLD.
YOU LOOK 45,

38:38.717 --> 38:40.852
-SO, THIS WILL HELP.
-FIRST OF ALL,
-I DON'T LOOK 45.

38:40.886 --> 38:43.889
-THIS LOOKS LIKE I'M 14.
-NO, IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE YOU'RE 14.

38:43.922 --> 38:46.358
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE AWESOME,
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

38:46.392 --> 38:47.593
-I'LL TRY THEM ON.
-COME ON, LET'S GO.

38:47.626 --> 38:50.061
-I'LL TRY IT ONE TIME.
-OKAY, LET'S GO.

38:50.095 --> 38:52.097
COME ON! LET'S GO!

38:52.130 --> 38:56.468
I'M SERIOUS.
IT'S GONNA BE FUN.

38:56.502 --> 38:57.769
HEY, HOW DO I GET
ONE OF THESE--

38:57.803 --> 38:59.738
DON'T TOUCH MY TROPHIES.

39:02.874 --> 39:05.711
I HEARD THAT.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.746
I HEARD THAT AGAIN.

39:10.416 --> 39:11.650
WOW.

39:30.802 --> 39:32.704
EXCUSE ME, I'M SORRY.

39:32.738 --> 39:37.643
EXCUSE ME, HEY.
HI. HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

39:37.676 --> 39:40.412
UM, STOP ACTING
LIKE A DOUCHE.

39:40.446 --> 39:42.714
DUDE, I KNOW HOW TO TALK
TO THE LADIES.

39:42.748 --> 39:43.982
-OH, YEAH?
-YEAH.

39:44.015 --> 39:45.784
WRITING YOUR NUMBER
ON $100 BILLS,

39:45.817 --> 39:48.520
IT MIGHT WORK IN L.A.,
BUT IT DOESN'T WORK HERE.

39:51.857 --> 39:56.728
WELL, IT MIGHT WORK HERE,
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND,

39:56.762 --> 39:59.965
WHY IS THIS SO HARD
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW?

39:59.998 --> 40:01.933
SERIOUSLY.

40:01.967 --> 40:06.472
I MEAN, YOU GOT CORI
ALL THE WAY TO THE ALTAR.

40:06.505 --> 40:09.007
I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS A LOW BLOW.

40:10.476 --> 40:11.977
DUDE, I DON'T EVEN
WANNA BE HERE.

40:12.010 --> 40:14.780
THE ONLY REASON I'M OUT
IS BECAUSE YOU DRAGGED ME OUT.

40:14.813 --> 40:16.582
I WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME
WATCHING STEVE HARVEY

40:16.615 --> 40:19.918
ON "FAMILY FEUD."

40:19.951 --> 40:22.020
WHY YOU GOTTA-- WHY YOU GOTTA
TALK ABOUT "FAMILY FEUD"

40:22.053 --> 40:25.524
IN A CLUB, MAN?
SEE WHAT HAP--

40:25.557 --> 40:26.758
I WANNA GRAB
A MINUTE WITH YOU.

40:26.792 --> 40:29.160
YEAH.
GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

40:29.194 --> 40:31.630
JUST-- DON'T DO
ANYTHING STUPID.

40:34.633 --> 40:36.034
LADIES!

40:44.810 --> 40:46.044
NICK, WHERE YOU AT, MAN?

40:50.916 --> 40:52.183
I TOLD YOU I'D MAKE
YOU MONEY TONIGHT.

40:52.217 --> 40:53.619
WHAT DID I SAY?

40:53.652 --> 40:54.853
UNBELIEVABLE.
THE PLACE IS PACKED.

40:54.886 --> 40:56.555
-RIGHT?
-IT'S WALL TO WALL IN HERE.

40:56.588 --> 40:58.990
HEY, WHEN NICK SAYS JUMP,
PEOPLE SAY "HOW HIGH."

40:59.024 --> 41:02.193
HOW LONG,
HOW FAR, HOW FAST?

41:02.227 --> 41:03.829
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT ANY OF THAT MEANT,

41:03.862 --> 41:05.597
-BUT IT SOUNDED
GOOD COMING OUT.
-DOESN'T MATTER.

41:05.631 --> 41:07.232
JUST KEEP IT UP, BROTHER,
WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE DOING.

41:11.870 --> 41:14.506
HEY, HOW DOES SHE HAPPEN
TO BE EVERYWHERE WE ARE?

41:14.540 --> 41:17.208
EVERYONE COMES
TO NICK'S PARTIES.
LOOK AROUND!

41:17.242 --> 41:18.777
THE LAST TIME
WE SAW EACH OTHER,

41:18.810 --> 41:20.245
WE DIDN'T EXACTLY END
ON GOOD TERMS, MAN.

41:20.278 --> 41:21.647
DID HE COME TOO FAST?

41:21.680 --> 41:23.181
NO, MAN!

41:23.214 --> 41:24.783
WE HAD AN ARGUMENT
IN THE RESTAURANT.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.518
SHE KINDA STORMED OUT.

41:26.552 --> 41:28.820
OKAY, WELL, I DON'T WANT YOU
TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING

41:28.854 --> 41:30.989
BUSINESS RELATED
OR WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY

41:31.022 --> 41:34.960
OR LAST WEEK
OR FIVE YEARS AGO,
JUST HAVE FUN.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.528
I JUST WANT YOU
TO HAVE FUN.

41:36.562 --> 41:37.963
WELL, I MEAN, IF I'M STILL
UP FOR THE GRANT,

41:37.996 --> 41:40.799
IT COULD BE A MAJOR
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.734
LET'S GO TALK TO HER.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.873
OH, HELLO, LADIES.

41:47.906 --> 41:49.641
HI.

41:49.675 --> 41:53.745
UM, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
MR. STEVENS.

41:53.779 --> 41:57.082
-IT'S COLE.
-NO, IT'S LIKE
BOILING IN HERE.

41:57.115 --> 41:59.718
NO, MY MIDDLE NAME,
IT'S COLE.

41:59.751 --> 42:02.087
OH, THOMAS COLE STEVENS.

42:03.254 --> 42:04.656
SEXY.

42:04.690 --> 42:06.925
YOU LOOK AMAZING,
BY THE WAY.

42:06.958 --> 42:08.594
THANK YOU.

42:08.627 --> 42:10.161
YOU LOOK PRETTY GOOD
YOURSELF.

42:10.195 --> 42:13.064
IT'S A NEW LOOK.
IT WORKS.

42:13.098 --> 42:14.633
MY STYLIST HERE
TOOK CARE OF ME.

42:14.666 --> 42:16.334
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
JUST A PRETTY FACE.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.570
I-- I ACTUALLY
DO IT ALL.

42:18.604 --> 42:22.207
YES, HE DOES.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.775
LET'S GO BACK
TO MY PLACE.

42:23.809 --> 42:26.177
AH, ACTUALLY,

42:26.211 --> 42:29.114
I'M GOING HOME
WITH A LADY TONIGHT, SO--

42:29.147 --> 42:30.882
-WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
-HMM?

42:30.916 --> 42:34.953
* I CAN LOVE YOU BETTER
THAN SHE CAN *

42:36.988 --> 42:38.690
-ACTUALLY--
-HMM?

42:38.724 --> 42:40.592
THREE'S NOT A CROWD
IN MY PLAYBOOK.

42:40.626 --> 42:43.328
YOU'RE SO BAD.
IT'S SO GOOD.

42:43.361 --> 42:45.163
-OOH, SHALL WE?
-MMM.

42:45.196 --> 42:46.164
-YEAH.
-OOH.

42:46.197 --> 42:47.298
OOH.

43:22.233 --> 43:24.335
-MMM.
-HEY.

43:30.375 --> 43:32.177
I HAVE TO GET
TO THE BAKERY.

43:32.210 --> 43:34.846
NO.

43:34.880 --> 43:37.215
BUT I'D LOVE TO SEE YOU
AGAIN TONIGHT.

43:37.248 --> 43:38.984
OKAY.

43:39.017 --> 43:43.188
HOW ABOUT DINNER,
MY PLACE?

43:43.221 --> 43:47.025
-OKAY.
-OKAY.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.698
MM-MM-MM.

43:58.203 --> 44:01.039
ALYSSA, THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

44:07.378 --> 44:11.282
THE FOUNDATION'S BEEN
LOOKING AT YOUR FINANCES

44:11.316 --> 44:13.952
AND, I MEAN, WE SEE
YOU'RE MAKING MONEY,

44:13.985 --> 44:16.988
BUT YOU'RE BEHIND
ON YOUR RENT.

44:17.022 --> 44:20.358
OH, I MEAN,
A LITTLE BIT BEHIND,
BUT, IT'S OKAY.

44:20.391 --> 44:23.729
WHY HAVE YOU STOPPED GIVING
TO THE COMMUNITY THIS YEAR?

44:23.762 --> 44:26.464
IS THIS WHAT WE'RE GONNA
TALK ABOUT FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING?

44:26.497 --> 44:30.736
I MEAN, IS IT ME
THAT YOU WANT,

44:30.769 --> 44:32.070
OR THE BAKERY?

44:32.103 --> 44:33.972
AHEM...

44:35.907 --> 44:38.376
I'M SORRY, BUT I--
I JUST NEED TO KNOW

44:38.409 --> 44:39.878
THESE THINGS THOUGH.

44:39.911 --> 44:41.046
WELL, IF YOU WANNA
TALK ABOUT BUSINESS,

44:41.079 --> 44:42.280
COME TO THE BAKERY.

44:47.753 --> 44:49.821
LOCK THE DOOR
ON YOUR WAY OUT.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.776
-MMM.
-NO, WE HAD FUN.

45:10.809 --> 45:14.112
IT'S JUST-- I'M NOT SURE
IF IT'S ME THAT HE LIKES

45:14.145 --> 45:17.148
OR THE SEX IS PART
OF HIS EVALUATING PROCESS

45:17.182 --> 45:19.484
-FOR THE GRANT.
-HMMM...

45:21.119 --> 45:22.353
GOOD MORNING.

45:22.387 --> 45:23.955
-HI.
-HEY, WHAT CAN
I GET YOU?

45:23.989 --> 45:25.757
-WELL, CAN I GET--
-ACTUALLY, WAIT A MINUTE.

45:25.791 --> 45:27.759
COULD YOU JUST
GIVE US A SECOND, SIR?

45:27.793 --> 45:30.528
SO, WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU GUYS TALKED ABOUT
BUSINESS DURING SEX?

45:30.561 --> 45:31.963
IT'S KIND OF A TURN-ON.

45:31.997 --> 45:33.264
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE MONEY, HUH?

45:33.298 --> 45:34.399
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO WITH IT?

45:34.432 --> 45:36.234
YOU'RE RIDICULOUS.

45:36.267 --> 45:38.870
SO WAIT, HOW DID
BUSINESS COME UP?

45:38.904 --> 45:40.471
I WAS GETTING READY
FOR WORK THIS MORNING
HALF NAKED,

45:40.505 --> 45:42.307
AND HE JUST ASKED ME
OUT OF THE BLUE.

45:42.340 --> 45:43.975
-THAT IS WEIRD.
-RIGHT?

45:44.009 --> 45:45.443
WELL, MAYBE HE'S PLAYING
DOWN THE MIDDLE

45:45.476 --> 45:47.345
BECAUSE TECHNICALLY
IT IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST

45:47.378 --> 45:49.147
FOR YOU TO BE SLEEPING
WITH SOMEONE FROM THE GRANT.

45:49.180 --> 45:51.216
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
A LITTLE EXTRA BENEFIT.

45:51.249 --> 45:53.885
BUT, TIME WILL TELL
IF SOMETHING IN THE MILK
ISN'T WHITE.

45:53.919 --> 45:56.154
-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
-YOU KNOW, LIKE WHEN YOU
HAVE SEX WITH SOMEONE.

45:56.187 --> 45:57.889
IN THE MORNING
IT HURTS TO PEE.
THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW

45:57.923 --> 45:59.157
WHEN SOMETHING
IN THE MILK ISN'T WHITE.

45:59.190 --> 46:02.493
SO TRUE.

46:02.527 --> 46:04.395
WHAT CAN I GET YOU, SIR?
ARE YOU IN OUR CONVERSATION?

46:04.429 --> 46:07.498
-UH, I WANT A CUPCAKE.
-OKAY. HERE YOU GO.

46:07.532 --> 46:09.467
AND NEXT TIME
I'M CHARGING YOU DOUBLE.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.269
-GO.
-I'M SORRY.

46:11.302 --> 46:12.503
-BELLA.
-WHAT?

46:12.537 --> 46:14.372
GIVE AWAY ONE MORE CUPCAKE,

46:14.405 --> 46:16.007
-IT'S COMING OUT
OF YOUR PAYCHECK.
-YOU KNOW WHAT, BABY,

46:16.041 --> 46:17.876
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE COMEBACK.

46:17.909 --> 46:21.212
YOU GIVE THEM ONE,
THEY KEEP COMING BACK
FOR A DOZEN MORE.

46:21.246 --> 46:23.048
YOU STILL HAVEN'T
TOLD ME HOW IT WAS.

46:23.081 --> 46:24.582
A LADY NEVER TELLS.

46:24.615 --> 46:27.986
WHICH IS WHY I'M WAITING
FOR YOU TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

46:28.019 --> 46:29.387
-GIRL, YOU'RE SILLY WAY...
-HI.

46:29.420 --> 46:32.924
MM-HMM.
LIGHT A CIGARETTE,
WORK IT OUT.

46:32.958 --> 46:34.292
-WHAT CAN I GET YOU?
-WORK IT OUT.

46:34.325 --> 46:37.128
SO, SAW YOU WENT HOME
WITH ALYSSA LAST NIGHT.

46:37.162 --> 46:38.897
DON'T YOU THINK THAT IT'S--
I DON'T KNOW--

46:38.930 --> 46:40.498
A LITTLE BIT OF A CONFLICT
OF INTEREST?

46:40.531 --> 46:44.535
FOUNDER OF TKS
GIVES GRANT TO THE GIRL
HE'S BANGING?

46:44.569 --> 46:46.171
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I SAID THAT TO YOU
LAST NIGHT

46:46.204 --> 46:48.373
AND YOUR RESPONSE WAS,
"LIVE IN THE MOMENT."

46:48.406 --> 46:51.309
YEAH, I WAS TALKING
ABOUT DANCING.

46:51.342 --> 46:53.044
HOW DO YOU KNOW I EVEN
HAD SEX WITH HER?

46:53.078 --> 46:55.513
OH, COME ON, MAN.
LOOK AT-- OOH--

46:55.546 --> 46:58.149
LOOK AT THE WAY
SHE WAS LOOKING AT YOU.

46:58.183 --> 47:00.485
I MEAN, IF YOU DIDN'T,
I CAN TOTALLY INTRODUCE YOU

47:00.518 --> 47:03.121
TO SOME GUYS
IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

47:03.154 --> 47:06.391
- JUST PUT IT DOWN HERE.
- OKAY.

47:08.894 --> 47:11.562
SHE'S GREAT,
BUT, SHE'S DEFINITELY
HIDING SOMETHING,

47:11.596 --> 47:14.165
SO, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
NOT PAY RENT

47:14.199 --> 47:16.201
UNLESS SOMETHING UNDERHANDED
IS GOING ON.

47:16.234 --> 47:18.236
YEAH. TIME WILL TELL.

47:18.269 --> 47:20.105
THE DECISION NEEDS TO BE MADE
IN THE NEXT TWO DAYS.

47:20.138 --> 47:23.875
WELL, YOU GOTTA DECIDE,
ARE YOU GONNA GET LAID,

47:23.909 --> 47:25.210
OR GET HER PAID?

47:25.243 --> 47:27.645
AS LONG AS YOU GET ONE,
THE OTHER'S GOING AWAY.

47:27.678 --> 47:29.180
WAS THAT KANYE?

47:29.214 --> 47:32.217
NO, THAT WAS NICK PHILIPS.
OH, YEAH, BABY.

47:32.250 --> 47:35.086
OH, IT'S ALL ABOUT TO FAIL!

47:42.093 --> 47:43.528
SIR, CAN I HELP YOU?

47:43.561 --> 47:46.131
UM, DO YOU KNOW
ALYSSA STOCK?

47:46.164 --> 47:48.433
YEAH, I DO.

47:48.466 --> 47:50.501
ARE YOU THE MIRACLE
WE NEED?

47:50.535 --> 47:52.570
WELL, I'VE BEEN
CALLED WORSE.

47:52.603 --> 47:54.039
WHAT DO I NEED TO CURE?

47:54.072 --> 47:55.640
IT'S THE STILLWELL
CORPORATION,

47:55.673 --> 47:57.442
THEY'RE TRYING
TO TAKE THIS PLACE OVER

47:57.475 --> 47:59.377
AND TEAR IT DOWN
AND BUILD CONDOS.

47:59.410 --> 48:01.512
ALYSSA'S BEEN TRYING
TO HELP OUT FINANCIALLY,

48:01.546 --> 48:03.949
BUT IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH.

48:03.982 --> 48:05.283
I TALKED TO HER
ABOUT TALKING TO SOMEONE

48:05.316 --> 48:06.918
WHO MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP.

48:06.952 --> 48:10.388
NOW, WHY IS THIS
SUCH A BIG DEAL TO ALYSSA?

48:10.421 --> 48:13.992
BESIDES THE FACT THAT HER
GRANDMOTHER LIVES HERE,

48:14.025 --> 48:16.928
IT'S THE LAST PLACE
HER MOTHER LIVED
BEFORE SHE DIED.

48:16.962 --> 48:19.530
UM, AM I ABLE TO SPEAK
WITH HER GRANDMOTHER?

48:22.000 --> 48:25.270
YEAH, FOLLOW ME.

48:28.506 --> 48:30.942
KNOCK KNOCK, MRS. STOCK.

48:30.976 --> 48:32.210
YOU HAVE A VISITOR.

48:32.243 --> 48:34.112
HE'S A FRIEND OF ALYSSA'S.

48:34.145 --> 48:38.716
OH, A HANDSOME VISITOR.

48:38.749 --> 48:41.352
ARE YOU ALYSSA'S
NEW BOYFRIEND?

48:41.386 --> 48:44.022
-YOU OKAY, JOSEPHINE?
-YES, I'M GOOD.

48:44.055 --> 48:47.025
-I'LL BE OUTSIDE.
-OKAY, THANKS.

48:47.058 --> 48:49.961
UH, NO, I AM--
I JUST CAME TO ASK
SOME QUESTIONS

48:49.995 --> 48:51.029
ABOUT BABE'S BAKERY.

48:51.062 --> 48:52.998
THE BAKERY.

48:53.031 --> 48:57.302
YOU KNOW, WE WERE VOTED
THE BEST BAKERY ON THE BLOCK

48:57.335 --> 48:59.504
ALL THROUGH THE 80s.

48:59.537 --> 49:01.172
THE 80s?

49:01.206 --> 49:03.141
YOU DIDN'T OWN IT
UNTIL 1994.

49:03.174 --> 49:06.311
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

49:06.344 --> 49:07.645
DID YOU KNOW
THERESA STEVENS?

49:07.678 --> 49:11.516
THERESA?
SHE IS BABE'S BAKERY.

49:11.549 --> 49:13.751
SHE TURNED IT OVER TO ME.

49:13.784 --> 49:15.720
SWEET LADY.

49:15.753 --> 49:18.089
SO, WHY DID YOU STEAL
IT FROM HER?

49:18.123 --> 49:19.524
STEAL IT?

49:19.557 --> 49:21.559
THERESA AND I WERE FRIENDS.

49:21.592 --> 49:23.294
SHE WAS MY MENTOR.

49:23.328 --> 49:27.198
I WOULD NEVER
STEAL FROM HER.

49:27.232 --> 49:29.300
THEN HOW DID YOU
GET THE BAKERY?

49:29.334 --> 49:32.203
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU.

49:32.237 --> 49:34.005
THERESA!

49:34.039 --> 49:37.775
COME HERE AND TASTE
THIS CUPCAKE.

49:37.808 --> 49:41.112
I THINK I'VE GOT
YOUR RECIPE DOWN.

49:44.315 --> 49:47.052
UM, JOSEPHINE, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

49:55.193 --> 49:59.064
I'M SICK, JOSEPHINE.

49:59.097 --> 50:02.267
AND I HAVE THAT BEAUTIFUL
BABY BOY OVER THERE.

50:04.435 --> 50:08.273
I CAN SPEND THE NEXT YEAR
BEHIND THIS COUNTER,

50:08.306 --> 50:10.475
OR I CAN SPEND IT
WITH HIM.

50:13.811 --> 50:18.416
THERESA, I'M SO SORRY.

50:18.449 --> 50:20.351
WHAT CAN I DO?

50:26.291 --> 50:30.728
I NEED YOU TO TAKE
OVER THE BAKERY.

50:30.761 --> 50:32.697
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

50:32.730 --> 50:34.765
I'VE ALREADY CONTACTED
THE LAWYERS

50:34.799 --> 50:36.401
AND THEY'VE DRAWN UP
THE PAPERWORK

50:36.434 --> 50:39.537
TRANSFERRING OWNERSHIP
OF THE BAKERY TO YOU.

50:39.570 --> 50:43.408
-WHY ME?
-WHY NOT YOU?

50:43.441 --> 50:45.776
YOUR PASSION,
YOUR LOYALTY.

50:45.810 --> 50:48.213
I MEAN,
THE INSPIRATION
YOU BRING

50:48.246 --> 50:51.816
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
WE'RE ALREADY PARTNERS.

50:51.849 --> 50:53.551
-BABE'S BAKERY?
-TELL ME YOU'LL DO IT.

50:53.584 --> 50:57.322
I NEED YOU TO DO IT.

50:57.355 --> 50:59.857
ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART,

50:59.890 --> 51:03.428
BUT BABE'S BAKERY
WILL ALWAYS BE YOURS.

51:06.231 --> 51:07.532
THANK YOU.

51:17.675 --> 51:19.377
I HAVE TO GO.

51:29.720 --> 51:34.625
THIS WAS MY FIRST APRON.

51:34.659 --> 51:37.362
I'M GONNA KEEP IT, OKAY?

51:46.237 --> 51:48.873
SO SHE CHOSE ME?

51:48.906 --> 51:52.510
SHE CHOSE YOU,
WHOEVER YOU ARE.

51:54.379 --> 51:58.449
DID I TELL YOU THAT
I MET MY HUSBAND HERE?

51:58.483 --> 52:00.685
VOLUNTEERING AS TEENAGERS.

52:00.718 --> 52:04.155
SURE DID.

52:04.189 --> 52:05.723
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I GOTTA GET GOING,

52:05.756 --> 52:09.660
-BUT, THANK YOU.
-YOU'RE WELCOME.

52:34.852 --> 52:37.755
HI.
COME ON IN.

52:37.788 --> 52:40.358
OH.
SORRY.

52:40.391 --> 52:42.960
SORRY.
DECIDED TO KEEP
IT CASUAL, I SEE.

52:42.993 --> 52:45.263
YEAH, I FIGURED WHY
DRESS UP FOR A DATE

52:45.296 --> 52:46.497
AT A STRANGER'S HOUSE.

52:46.531 --> 52:47.865
OKAY.

52:50.701 --> 52:52.637
IS IT COLOGNE-FEST
IN HERE?

52:52.670 --> 52:55.773
SORRY ABOUT THAT,
I-- I OBVIOUSLY SPRAYED
A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

52:55.806 --> 52:57.508
YOU THINK?

52:57.542 --> 52:59.810
IS THIS HOW YOU GOT
YOUR LAST GIRLFRIEND?

52:59.844 --> 53:01.346
OR IS THAT WHY
SHE LEFT YOU?

53:01.379 --> 53:03.548
UH... AM I MISSING
SOMETHING HERE OR--

53:03.581 --> 53:05.683
I DON'T KNOW.
ARE YOU?

53:09.354 --> 53:10.955
CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

53:10.988 --> 53:12.557
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

53:12.590 --> 53:14.825
WATER AND--
LET ME CHECK.

53:17.928 --> 53:20.298
LOOKS LIKE I JUST
HAVE WATER.

53:20.331 --> 53:22.533
WELL, THEN, WATER
WILL BE GREAT.

53:22.567 --> 53:24.702
-DO YOU HAVE ICE?
-VERY FUNNY.

53:29.006 --> 53:32.277
MM-HMM.

53:32.310 --> 53:33.944
SO, I MADE ENCHILADAS.

53:33.978 --> 53:35.580
HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

53:35.613 --> 53:38.215
MMM. LOOKS LIKE THROW UP.

53:39.817 --> 53:42.253
AHEM...

53:42.287 --> 53:43.821
-HALF A CROISSANT?
-WELL.

53:43.854 --> 53:45.890
ARE YOU RATIONING
MY FOOD?

53:54.332 --> 53:56.601
WHAT THE HELL
IS YOUR PROBLEM?

53:56.634 --> 53:59.036
I WENT BY CSW
NURSING HOME TODAY.

53:59.069 --> 54:01.038
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE?

54:01.071 --> 54:02.873
OKAY, THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU NOW.

54:02.907 --> 54:04.909
DID YOU FOLLOW ME THERE?

54:08.646 --> 54:10.448
LOOK, LISTEN, I THINK
IT'S ADMIRABLE

54:10.481 --> 54:12.283
THAT YOU'RE FIGHTING
A BIG CORPORATION

54:12.317 --> 54:14.485
FOR YOUR MOTHER'S NURSING HOME
TO STAY IN BUSINESS. I DO.

54:14.519 --> 54:16.454
BUT I ALSO THINK
I CAN HELP YOU

54:16.487 --> 54:18.723
INSTEAD OF YOU USING
THE MONEY FROM THE BAKERY.

54:18.756 --> 54:19.990
THIS ISN'T YOUR BURDEN.

54:20.024 --> 54:21.659
I'M NOT YOUR CHARITY CASE.

54:21.692 --> 54:23.961
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO COME IN AND SAVE THE DAY.

54:23.994 --> 54:25.530
THEN WHY DID YOU APPLY
FOR MY GRANT?

54:25.563 --> 54:26.964
'CAUSE WHAT ARE YOU REALLY
GONNA DO WITH THE MONEY?

54:26.997 --> 54:28.533
-SCREW YOU.
-ALYSSA, SERIOUSLY.

54:28.566 --> 54:30.435
COME HERE.
ALYSSA!

54:36.541 --> 54:39.477
RAY, YOU BEAUTIFUL RAY
OF SUNLIGHT.

54:39.510 --> 54:42.847
WHAT DID I TELL YOU.
KEEP 'EM COMING.

54:42.880 --> 54:44.482
THANK YOU, RAY.

54:44.515 --> 54:46.451
HERE, DRINK THIS.
IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

54:46.484 --> 54:47.952
CHEERS.

54:47.985 --> 54:49.654
DON'T LOOK SO HAPPY.

54:51.055 --> 54:55.360
I NEED A BLOW JOB.

54:55.393 --> 54:57.362
BY MYSELF?

54:59.497 --> 55:03.334
-HI, HOW ARE YOU?
-HI.

55:03.368 --> 55:05.770
WHAT YOUR NAME?

55:05.803 --> 55:06.971
I DON'T HAVE A NAME.

55:07.004 --> 55:08.706
-OH.
-WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

55:08.739 --> 55:10.941
MY NAME'S MICHAEL.
I'M THE OWNER.

55:10.975 --> 55:13.711
MY DRESS IS SLUTTY.

55:13.744 --> 55:16.514
ALYSSA, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP.

55:16.547 --> 55:18.383
MY WHOLE PURPOSE
FOR COMING HERE

55:18.416 --> 55:19.684
WAS TO EVALUATE YOU
AND DETERMINE

55:19.717 --> 55:21.786
IF YOU WERE WORTHY
FOR THE GRANT.

55:21.819 --> 55:23.621
I WAS SO FOCUSED
ON WHAT YOU WEREN'T DOING

55:23.654 --> 55:27.792
BECAUSE EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU
AND THE BAKERY DIDN'T ADD UP.

55:27.825 --> 55:29.960
IT'S UNFORTUNATE
THAT I FOUND OUT THIS WAY

55:29.994 --> 55:32.430
BECAUSE I DECEIVED YOU.

55:32.463 --> 55:35.933
BUT I'M HAPPY I FOUND OUT.

55:35.966 --> 55:38.035
I NOT ONLY FOUND OUT
THAT YOU'RE WORTHY
FOR THE GRANT,

55:38.068 --> 55:41.806
BUT THAT YOU'RE
AN AMAZING WOMAN.

55:43.441 --> 55:47.111
I JUST WANT TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH YOU.

55:47.144 --> 55:49.414
I DON'T KNOW.
JUST CALL ME.

55:51.882 --> 55:54.419
OKAY, LOOK,
IT'S BEEN FUN,
BUT I JUST--

55:58.055 --> 55:59.390
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

56:05.530 --> 56:06.964
WHY ARE YOU JUST
GETTING HERE?

56:06.997 --> 56:08.933
I JUST GOT THE PHONE CALL.
I WAS HERE ALL NIGHT.

56:08.966 --> 56:11.536
YEAH? WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE
DO YOU HAVE LOOKING
AFTER MY GRANNY?

56:11.569 --> 56:12.937
LISTEN, THEY WERE
THE SAME PEOPLE

56:12.970 --> 56:14.772
THAT TOOK CARE OF YOUR MOM
WHEN SHE WAS HERE.

56:14.805 --> 56:16.507
THEY'RE THE SAME PEOPLE
THAT HAVE TAKEN CARE
OF YOUR GRANNY

56:16.541 --> 56:17.408
FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS.

56:17.442 --> 56:18.809
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
UNSATISFACTORY CARE.

56:18.843 --> 56:20.878
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
YOU SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN.

56:20.911 --> 56:22.680
-ALYSSA, I KNOW
YOU'RE ANGRY,
-YEAH.

56:22.713 --> 56:25.450
BUT CAN WE FOCUS ON FINDING
YOUR GRANDMOTHER, PLEASE.

56:26.984 --> 56:28.786
OKAY, WHERE WAS
SHE LAST SEEN?

56:39.464 --> 56:40.831
BELLA, I CAN'T TALK
RIGHT NOW.

56:40.865 --> 56:42.667
NO, MY GRANNY'S MISSING.

56:46.604 --> 56:49.106
WHAT? OKAY,
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

56:49.139 --> 56:51.476
-DID SHE FIND HER?
-YEAH.

56:54.979 --> 56:57.715
OH, HI, BRAD.

56:57.748 --> 57:02.086
-HI, BELLA.
-THANK YOU.

57:02.119 --> 57:04.088
-HELLO.
-NATALIE.

57:04.121 --> 57:07.725
-THANK YOU.
-NEXT.

57:07.758 --> 57:10.761
STEP RIGHT UP.
WHAT CAN I GET YOU,
SWEETHEART?

57:10.795 --> 57:12.730
CAN I GET A CHOCOLATE
CUPCAKE?

57:12.763 --> 57:17.201
"MAY I HAVE
A CHOCOLATE CUPCAKE, PLEASE."

57:17.234 --> 57:20.204
MAY I HAVE
A CHOCOLATE CUPCAKE, PLEASE?

57:20.237 --> 57:23.808
I KNEW THAT YOU HAD MANNERS
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

57:23.841 --> 57:26.611
YOU ARE SMILING
A LITTLE TOO HARD

57:26.644 --> 57:27.778
TO BE LOOKING AT A SCREEN.

57:27.812 --> 57:29.046
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

57:29.079 --> 57:30.648
A COUPLE OF MY FRIENDS
JUST POSTED

57:30.681 --> 57:32.650
SOME FUNNY PICTURES
ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

57:32.683 --> 57:34.485
IG?

57:34.519 --> 57:35.553
YOU'RE ON INSTAGRAM?

57:35.586 --> 57:38.823
STRAIGHT FLEXIN'.

57:38.856 --> 57:40.591
WELL, LET'S TAKE A PICTURE,
SO I CAN POST IT.

57:40.625 --> 57:42.192
COOL.

57:42.226 --> 57:44.795
OH, THIS IS GREAT.

57:44.829 --> 57:46.196
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
DON'T FORGET TO TAG ME.

57:46.230 --> 57:48.165
I WON'T.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ON THERE?

57:48.198 --> 57:50.935
BELLA, WHAT'S
MY NAME ON IG?

57:50.968 --> 57:53.771
GRANNY 5150.

57:53.804 --> 57:55.840
DID YOU JUST CALL ME CRAZY?

57:55.873 --> 57:58.609
GRANNY, IT'S JUST A NAME.

57:58.643 --> 58:00.945
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY.

58:00.978 --> 58:03.213
AND DON'T FORGET
YOUR MANNERS NEXT TIME.

58:03.247 --> 58:05.716
YES, MA'AM.

58:05.750 --> 58:07.017
BYE.

58:09.620 --> 58:10.921
GRANNY!

58:10.955 --> 58:12.623
-ALYSSA!
-WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

58:12.657 --> 58:15.292
BABY, GIRL! OH!

58:15.325 --> 58:18.629
BELLA WAS TELLING ME
HOW YOUR GRANDPA

58:18.663 --> 58:21.131
SHOULD GET ME
A PEARL NECKLACE.

58:21.165 --> 58:23.233
-REALLY?
-WELL...

58:23.267 --> 58:24.702
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

58:24.735 --> 58:26.103
THE SAME WAY I'VE BEEN
GETTING HERE

58:26.136 --> 58:28.072
FOR THE LAST 13 YEARS.

58:28.105 --> 58:29.874
I GOT ON THE BUS.

58:29.907 --> 58:31.776
SINCE WHEN DO YOU
TAKE THE BUS?

58:31.809 --> 58:36.280
YOUR GRANDPA AND I
HAVE BEEN RIDING
A BUS FOREVER.

58:36.313 --> 58:38.616
AND SPEAKING OF WHICH,

58:38.649 --> 58:41.819
WHERE IS YOUR GRANDPA?

58:41.852 --> 58:44.121
GRANNY, I THINK
WE SHOULD TAKE YOU BACK

58:44.154 --> 58:46.056
TO THE NURSING HOME, OKAY?

58:46.090 --> 58:49.727
ALYSSA, I WANT TO TURN
THE PLACE OVER TO YOU,

58:49.760 --> 58:54.599
BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE
GOOD CARE OF IT.

58:54.632 --> 58:57.635
GRANNY, YOU GAVE ME
THIS PLACE SEVEN YEARS AGO.

58:57.668 --> 58:59.837
-I DID?
-YEAH.

59:02.172 --> 59:05.676
OKAY, WELL...

59:05.710 --> 59:07.845
TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT.

59:07.878 --> 59:10.114
I WILL.

59:10.147 --> 59:12.349
COME ON, LET'S GO, OKAY?

59:12.382 --> 59:14.852
COME ON.

59:14.885 --> 59:17.321
-THANKS, BELLE.
-YOU'RE WELCOME.

59:17.354 --> 59:19.256
-BYE, GRANNY.
-BYE.

59:22.126 --> 59:24.294
-THOMAS STEVENS.
-YES SIR, HOW ARE YOU?

59:24.328 --> 59:26.597
I'M JUST FINE,
THANK YOU.

59:26.631 --> 59:29.800
-IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
-YES, IT HAS NOW.

59:29.834 --> 59:32.302
NO ONE RUNNING AWAY
FROM US AT THE ALTAR.

59:32.336 --> 59:34.071
BETTER SHE RAN
AWAY FROM THE ALTAR,

59:34.104 --> 59:36.240
THAN AFTER TEN YEARS
OF MARRIAGE.

59:36.273 --> 59:38.042
WELL, I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE.

59:38.075 --> 59:40.678
TELL ME, NOW HOW LONG
ARE YOU GONNA BE IN TOWN?

59:40.711 --> 59:42.847
OH, ACTUALLY,
MY FOUNDATION IS EVALUATING

59:42.880 --> 59:44.749
-BABE'S BAKERY
FOR A GRANT.
-OH.

59:44.782 --> 59:46.183
I LEAVE TOMORROW NIGHT,
THOUGH.

59:46.216 --> 59:49.286
BABE'S BAKERY.
I JUST LOVE BABE'S BAKERY.

59:49.319 --> 59:51.388
MAN, MY WIFE AND I
GO THERE EVERY SATURDAY,

59:51.421 --> 59:55.125
AND THEN WE GO TO THE PARK
AND LIE ON THE GRASS.

59:55.159 --> 59:57.895
I TELL YOU WHAT
A FEELING OF TRANQUILITY.

59:57.928 --> 01:00:00.130
-NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD.
-YEAH.

01:00:00.164 --> 01:00:02.967
YOU KNOW, THAT GIRL,
THAT NEW OWNER,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.368
SHE'S QUITE A NICE GIRL.

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:08.773
YEAH, SHE SEEMS TO BE
ABOUT HER BUSINESS, TOO.

01:00:08.806 --> 01:00:12.176
YOU KNOW, BABE'S
ALWAYS GOT A LINE.

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:15.045
YEAH, SHE'S A GOOD WOMAN.

01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:18.082
SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE EVALUATING
A LOT MORE THAN THE BAKERY.

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:21.218
I'M GONNA TAKE MY TIME
ON THIS NEXT RELATIONSHIP,
PASTOR.

01:00:21.251 --> 01:00:23.921
THOMAS STEVENS,
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE WEDDING.

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.025
-HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
-YOU, TOO, SON.

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:29.226
-ALL RIGHT?
-YOU TAKE CARE.

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:30.928
-YES, SIR.
-YES.

01:00:41.038 --> 01:00:43.908
LONG TIME BABE'S BAKERY OWNER,
JOSEPHINE STOCK,

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:47.044
WANDERED OUT THE DOORS
OF THE CSW NURSING HOME
THIS MORNING

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:49.814
AND ENDED UP
BACK IN HER OLD BAKERY.

01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:52.016
IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG
FOR CUSTOMERS TO RUSH IN.

01:00:52.049 --> 01:00:54.451
SHE WAS RETURNED
TO THE NURSING HOME
THIS AFTERNOON,

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:57.421
WHERE LATER
SHE PASSED AWAY
IN HER SLEEP.

01:00:57.454 --> 01:00:59.757
WE'RE TOLD SHE SUFFERED
FROM DEMENTIA.

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:03.327
OUR CONDOLENCES GO OUT
TO THE FAMILY AT THIS TIME.

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:28.252
HI.

01:01:28.285 --> 01:01:31.989
I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:34.792
THANKS.

01:01:34.825 --> 01:01:38.963
WILL YOU MEET ME
AT BICENTENNIAL PARK?

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:41.365
IT ISN'T REALLY A GOOD TIME
RIGHT NOW, THOMAS.

01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:42.967
I KNOW. I KNOW.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.905
UM, THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:52.376
THEN, CAN'T YOU JUST
TELL ME RIGHT NOW.

01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:55.880
PLEASE...

01:01:55.913 --> 01:02:00.717
10 MINUTES, THAT'S IT.
BICENTENNIAL PARK.

01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:11.962
OKAY.

01:02:11.996 --> 01:02:14.999
SO, YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO TELL ME SOMETHING,

01:02:15.032 --> 01:02:18.735
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
I WANNA TELL YOU, TOO.

01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:26.210
I'M LOSING THE BAKERY.

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:29.313
AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS GONNA
USE THE MONEY FOR.

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:33.283
NOT THE STUFF I SHOWED YOU.

01:02:33.317 --> 01:02:34.885
I KNOW IT DISQUALIFIES ME,

01:02:34.919 --> 01:02:37.788
BUT, I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:46.897
WHEN I CAME HERE,
I HAD ULTERIOR MOTIVES.

01:02:46.931 --> 01:02:49.333
MY REAL GOAL WAS TO STOP YOU
FROM GETTING THE GRANT,

01:02:49.366 --> 01:02:53.503
AND TAKE BACK THE BAKERY.

01:02:53.537 --> 01:02:57.407
WHAT I DIDN'T
TELL YOU WAS...

01:02:57.441 --> 01:03:01.045
MY MOM STARTED
BABE'S BAKERY.

01:03:01.078 --> 01:03:03.914
SHE SOLD IT
TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER,

01:03:03.948 --> 01:03:07.184
WHICH I THOUGHT
SHE HAD STOLEN IT FROM US.

01:03:07.217 --> 01:03:09.053
BUT YOUR GRANDMOTHER
TOLD ME EVERYTHING

01:03:09.086 --> 01:03:12.122
AND I'M SORRY.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:15.860
I THINK IT'S ADMIRABLE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING

01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:20.464
FOR YOUR GRANNY
AND FOR THAT NURSING HOME.

01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:25.102
I WOULD GIVE YOU
THE GRANT,

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:27.504
BUT RULES ARE RULES,

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:30.240
AND I'LL TAKE IT BACK
TO THE BOARD

01:03:30.274 --> 01:03:32.276
AND TELL THEM
THE TRUTH,

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:37.081
AND ALL THEY CAN DO
IS VOTE YES OR NO.

01:03:37.114 --> 01:03:38.315
OKAY.

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:44.955
I GOTTA SAY IT'S NOT
THE BAKERY I'M GONNA MISS.

01:03:44.989 --> 01:03:49.493
I KNOW MY PATH IS GONNA
LEAD ME TO ANOTHER BAKERY,

01:03:49.526 --> 01:03:52.296
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I'M EVER
GONNA FIND ANOTHER YOU.

01:03:56.133 --> 01:03:57.935
I KNOW IT'S BEEN
TWO WEEKS.

01:03:57.968 --> 01:04:00.938
-IT'S CRAZY.
-YEAH, YEAH.

01:04:03.207 --> 01:04:05.075
I DON'T KNOW.

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:08.913
WHERE DO WE GO
FROM HERE?

01:04:18.055 --> 01:04:19.523
I HAVEN'T FELT THAT
FOR A WHILE.

01:04:19.556 --> 01:04:22.126
WHAT?

01:04:22.159 --> 01:04:23.493
SORRY.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:28.565
ALYSSA, WAIT!

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:31.535
ALYSSA!
JUST LISTEN TO ME.

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:33.403
GIVE ME A SECOND.
IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

01:04:33.437 --> 01:04:35.639
REALLY?
A LATE NIGHT DINNER
WITH YOUR EX.

01:04:35.672 --> 01:04:37.641
THAT'S NOT
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE?

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:43.948
-JUST GIVE ME--
-THIS WHAT YOU DO WITH
ALL THE GIRLS?

01:04:43.981 --> 01:04:46.917
WHAT GIRLS?
THERE ARE NO GIRLS.
IT'S ONLY YOU.

01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:48.285
NO, YOU WANT--
THIS IS JUST A SIGN

01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:51.088
THAT WHAT I WAS GONNA
SAY IS A MISTAKE.

01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:53.490
HAVE A SAFE TRIP HOME.

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:55.225
ALYSSA.

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:09.139
WHEN WERE YOU GONNA TELL ME?

01:05:09.173 --> 01:05:11.108
EVICTION NOTICE?

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:12.642
BELLE, IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

01:05:12.676 --> 01:05:14.044
WELL, YEAH,
IT'S MY PROBLEM

01:05:14.078 --> 01:05:15.245
IF MY BEST FRIEND
IS ABOUT TO LOSE

01:05:15.279 --> 01:05:16.580
THE ONLY THING
SHE'S EVER LOVED.

01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:18.182
IS THIS HOW YOU'VE BEEN
HELPING THE NURSING HOME

01:05:18.215 --> 01:05:21.551
-FROM SHUTTING DOWN?
-YEAH.

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:24.554
OKAY, WELL, THEN,
LET ME CALL SOME PEOPLE.

01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:26.323
NO, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

01:05:26.356 --> 01:05:28.592
I'M GONNA FIGURE IT OUT.
IT'S OKAY. I GOT IT.

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:30.194
WELL, FIGURE WHAT OUT?
I MEAN, YOU ONLY HAVE

01:05:30.227 --> 01:05:34.064
THREE DAYS TO COME UP
WITH $60,000.

01:05:34.098 --> 01:05:35.265
IT'S OKAY.

01:05:38.535 --> 01:05:40.170
LOOK, THOMAS JUST LEFT
A VOICEMAIL.

01:05:40.204 --> 01:05:43.007
MAYBE HE HAS GOOD NEWS.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.109
PROBABLY NOT.

01:05:45.142 --> 01:05:47.344
HEY ALYSSA, IF YOU'D JUST
PICK UP THE PHONE

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:49.980
AND GIVE ME
JUST A SECOND TO EXPLAIN

01:05:50.014 --> 01:05:52.549
I PROMISE YOU
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

01:05:52.582 --> 01:05:54.351
CALL ME BACK.
ALL RIGHT.

01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:55.519
I REALLY ENJOYED
SEEING YOU.

01:05:55.552 --> 01:05:57.721
OKAY.
JUST CALL ME.

01:05:57.754 --> 01:05:59.356
I KNEW IT.

01:05:59.389 --> 01:06:02.459
I KNEW EVERY TIME
Y'ALL SAW EACH OTHER

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:05.362
HE LOVES YOU.
YOU LOVE HIM.

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:07.064
-LOVE?
-MM-HMM.

01:06:07.097 --> 01:06:09.533
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
I'D BE OUT WITH MY FIANCÉE

01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:11.101
IF I WAS IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE.

01:06:11.135 --> 01:06:14.471
WELL, MAYBE THAT WAS
JUST MISUNDERSTANDING.

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:17.674
I THINK IF YOU CARE
ABOUT THIS PLACE

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:20.377
AND YOU CARE ABOUT HIM,
YOU NEED TO GO AFTER IT.

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:21.511
WELL, IT WOULDN'T WORK.

01:06:21.545 --> 01:06:23.213
I MEAN, HE LIVES
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:06:23.247 --> 01:06:25.082
AND I'M STAYING HERE.

01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:27.117
I MEAN, THE BAKERY
IS MY FIRST PRIORITY.

01:06:27.151 --> 01:06:29.119
OKAY, WELL, THEN, IF THIS
IS YOUR FIRST PRIORITY,

01:06:29.153 --> 01:06:31.588
THEN YOU NEED GO AFTER HIM
BECAUSE HE HAS THE MONEY
THAT YOU NEED.

01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:33.523
YEAH, WELL, I LIED TO HIM.

01:06:33.557 --> 01:06:35.425
I LIED TO HIM
ABOUT WHAT I WOULD DO
WITH THE MONEY.

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:38.528
I'M PRETTY SURE THE FOUNDATION
ISN'T GONNA PICK A LIAR.

01:06:38.562 --> 01:06:41.598
I'M JUST SAYING,
HE LOVES YOU,

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:45.369
HE HAS THE MONEY,
TAKE ADVANTAGE.

01:06:45.402 --> 01:06:48.505
#SUGAR DADDY.

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:59.316
SO THAT'S ALL
THIS WAS ABOUT?

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:02.219
IT WAS NEVER ABOUT ANYTHING
MORE THAN THE MONEY?

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:04.121
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

01:07:04.154 --> 01:07:06.156
DO I--

01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:07.357
'CAUSE YOU HAVE
A FUNNY WAY OF SHOWING

01:07:07.391 --> 01:07:09.159
BY NOT ANSWERING MY CALLS.

01:07:09.193 --> 01:07:11.628
I FIGURED YOU'D BE BUSY
WITH YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND,
AND ALL THAT.

01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:13.763
LOOK, LET'S NOT STRING
THIS ALONG ANY FURTHER.

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:19.769
CLEARLY WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN US WAS A MISTAKE.

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:21.338
I AGREE.

01:07:25.142 --> 01:07:27.077
OKAY.

01:07:27.111 --> 01:07:30.347
WELL, I WISH YOU THE BEST.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.717
AND I JUST WANTED
TO BE PROFESSIONAL

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:36.186
AND COME BY AND TELL YOU

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:39.689
YOU DIDN'T GET THE GRANT.

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:42.592
BEST WISHES
WITH THE BAKERY.

01:07:42.626 --> 01:07:45.395
THOMAS, WHATEVER
YOU HEARD IS WRONG.

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:48.432
HEY, THIS WOMAN LOVES YOU
AND I KNOW YOU LOVE HER.

01:07:48.465 --> 01:07:50.300
OKAY, PLEASE,
DON'T DO THIS.

01:07:50.334 --> 01:07:53.237
THIS PLACE
IS ALL SHE HAS.

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:55.239
YOU'RE ALL SHE HAS.

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.116
SORRY I COULDN'T BE
YOUR SUGAR DADDY.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:42.685
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:44.154
HEY, DID YOU GET
MY EMAIL?

01:08:44.188 --> 01:08:45.488
NO, WHAT EMAIL?

01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:46.490
THE EMAIL I JUST SENT YOU.

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:48.192
LOOK AT YOUR COMPUTER.

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:53.397
CSW NURSING HOME
WHICH HAD BEEN PROJECTED

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:54.497
TO CLOSE
AT MONTH'S END

01:08:54.531 --> 01:08:55.698
HAS GAINED NEW LIFE

01:08:55.732 --> 01:08:57.600
AFTER THE STILLWELL
CORPORATION

01:08:57.634 --> 01:09:00.870
DECIDED TO BUILD THEIR
FUTURISTIC CONDOMINIUMS
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.939
WE REACHED OUT
TO THE STILLWELL
CORPORATION

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:05.509
REGARDING THE SUDDEN CHANGE.

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:08.645
WELL, AFTER FURTHER EVALUATION
OF THE CSW NURSING HOME,

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:11.481
WE FEEL THIS PLACE HAS BEEN
AN ASSET TO OUR COMMUNITY

01:09:11.515 --> 01:09:13.483
IN SUPPORTING THE CARE
OF THE ELDERLY.

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:18.221
ONE DAY, OUR CEO, MY FATHER,
HE MIGHT NEED THE SUPPORT

01:09:18.255 --> 01:09:19.889
OF AN ASSISTED LIVING HOME,
LIKE THIS ONE,

01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:21.925
AND I DON'T WANT ANY COMPANY
COMING IN TO TEAR IT DOWN,

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:23.827
LEAVING HIM WITH
NO WHERE TO GO.

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:26.830
WAS THAT YOU?

01:09:26.863 --> 01:09:29.533
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:31.768
HOW'D YOU DO IT?

01:09:31.801 --> 01:09:34.304
I MEAN, WAIT,
ARE YOU ENGAGED AGAIN?

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:36.706
SHUT UP. NO, I'M NOT
ENGAGED AGAIN.

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.375
I JUST TOLD HER
IF SHE WANTED

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:40.609
TO MAKE IT UP TO ME
FOR LEAVING ME AT THE ALTAR,

01:09:40.644 --> 01:09:42.546
SHE'D LET ME BUY THEM OUT
THE NURSING HOME.

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:44.680
WAIT, WAIT, SO, YOU OWN
THE NURSING HOME?

01:09:44.714 --> 01:09:47.251
NO, THE THERESA KAREN STEVENS
FOUNDATION

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:48.652
OWNS THE NURSING HOME.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:51.921
OKAY, I-- I DON'T MEAN
TO BE INSENSITIVE HERE,

01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:56.593
BUT, ALYSSA'S GRANDMOTHER
JUST PASSED AWAY.

01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:59.296
WHY WOULD YOU BUY
THE NURSING HOME?

01:09:59.329 --> 01:10:01.298
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
DO IT FOR ALYSSA.

01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:04.534
I DID IT 'CAUSE IT WAS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

01:10:04.568 --> 01:10:06.536
IT'S WHAT MY MOM
WOULD HAVE DONE.

01:10:08.605 --> 01:10:10.674
"WELL DONE, GRASSHOPPER.

01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:12.376
WELL DONE."

01:10:15.011 --> 01:10:16.646
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY,
I'LL TALK TO YOU.

01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:42.739
SOMEONE BOUGHT
THE BAKERY ALREADY?

01:10:42.772 --> 01:10:45.875
THIS IS PRIME
REAL ESTATE, LADIES.

01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:48.578
SORRY, CLOSED, BUT, COME BACK
IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

01:10:48.612 --> 01:10:49.946
HEARD S&S WILL
BE EVEN BETTER.

01:10:49.979 --> 01:10:51.548
HEY, WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING WITH THAT?

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:52.782
-GIVE IT TO ME.
-OH, COME ON.

01:10:52.816 --> 01:10:54.318
-GIVE IT. TAKE IT.
-JUST GIVE IT.

01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:55.619
GET OUT OF HERE.
GET OUT.

01:10:55.652 --> 01:10:57.020
-ALL RIGHT.
-GET OUT OF HERE.

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:07.897
ALYSSA.

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:09.733
WHAT IS IT?

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:11.801
OPEN IT.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.885
OH, MY GOD.

01:11:28.918 --> 01:11:30.920
WE DID IT!
GRACIAS, JESÚS!

01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:33.923
GRACIAS, JESÚS.
OH, THANK YOU!

01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:35.725
OH, GRACIAS, JESÚS.

01:11:35.759 --> 01:11:38.395
SINCE WHEN DID YOU START
THANKING JESÚS IN SPANISH?

01:11:38.428 --> 01:11:40.664
OH, NO,
OUR MAILMAN, JESUS.

01:11:40.697 --> 01:11:43.800
"GRACIAS."
HE TAUGHT ME THAT.
IT'S SPANISH.

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:45.569
-OKAY.
-MM-HMM.

01:11:45.602 --> 01:11:46.836
WHAT?

01:11:51.007 --> 01:11:52.909
UH.

01:11:56.613 --> 01:11:57.847
CONGRATULATIONS.

01:11:57.881 --> 01:11:59.549
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS.

01:11:59.583 --> 01:12:01.851
IT MEANS I'M RICH, BITCH.

01:12:01.885 --> 01:12:05.655
WELL, UM, WE PUT
SO MUCH INTO BABES,
BOTH OF OUR FAMILIES,

01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:08.091
AND SINCE IT HAPPENS
TO BE ON THE MARKET,

01:12:08.124 --> 01:12:09.659
IT FALLS RIGHT IN LINE
WITH OUT NEWEST GRANT,

01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:11.495
WHICH ALLOWS US
TO BUY IT OUTRIGHT

01:12:11.528 --> 01:12:14.864
AND GIVE IT TO SOMEONE WHO'S
BEEN AN INSPIRATION TO US,

01:12:14.898 --> 01:12:18.134
AND TO COMMUNITIES
AND BAKERIES ACROSS
THE COUNTRY.

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:21.571
WOW, MY MIND IS BLOWN.

01:12:21.605 --> 01:12:24.808
I JUST, OKAY, SO I OWN
THE BAKERY NOW.

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:27.444
UM, WHAT ABOUT US?

01:12:27.477 --> 01:12:30.747
UH, JESÚS WILL BE YOUR MAN
FOR $200,000.

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:33.617
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE $200,000 IS FOR.

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:37.754
WELL, IT'S FOR START UP COSTS
FOR STOCK AND STEVENS

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:39.823
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:40.890
WHICH MEANS WE MIGHT
HAVE TO SPEND

01:12:40.924 --> 01:12:43.393
A LITTLE MORE TIME TOGETHER.

01:12:43.427 --> 01:12:46.996
I LOVE YOU.

A LOT BETTER

IF YOU SAID THAT
TO MY FACE.
