00:01.827 --> 00:02.741
Previously on Van Helsing.

00:02.785 --> 00:04.134
Sam.

00:05.962 --> 00:08.704
You're now the mouse.

00:08.747 --> 00:11.576
I am your future.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.406
You're different.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.060
A new power.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.279
They can't stay here.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.281
Theres no resources
there's no security.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.412
So what do we do?

00:21.456 --> 00:22.761
Denver.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.111
Supposed to be a safe zone.

00:24.154 --> 00:25.938
We'll never make it
out on our own.

00:25.982 --> 00:28.028
Yeah, you will.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.986
Cuz I'm going
to take you there.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.597
I am Felix.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.079
This new power I have.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.776
I'm going to give it
to you.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.865
I'm going to give it
to all of you.

00:39.909 --> 00:43.739
And together, the Sisterhood
will rule.

00:52.226 --> 00:55.881
And while it is different
and irregular.

00:55.925 --> 00:57.970
It's also not against
who we are

00:58.014 --> 01:00.321
and what we believe.

01:00.364 --> 01:04.847
He has shown his devotion
to this order many times over.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.763
And his devotion
to me as well.

01:07.806 --> 01:10.983
I might not be here today
if it were not for him.

01:11.027 --> 01:15.640
So I ask you, beseech you.

01:15.684 --> 01:21.472
What do we do about Scab?

01:21.516 --> 01:23.953
Does he stay with us?

01:23.996 --> 01:26.651
Or does he go?

01:26.695 --> 01:35.312
He is fine but he is
not us not like us.

01:35.356 --> 01:37.401
But he can be.

01:37.445 --> 01:41.231
He can be changed.

01:41.275 --> 01:44.974
Please... Sisters...
trust me.

01:45.017 --> 01:46.715
Allow me this honour.

01:46.758 --> 01:48.108
I will not fail you.

01:48.151 --> 01:53.069
I will help you restore
your ranks.

01:53.113 --> 01:57.421
Fine. Then let him
prove himself.

01:57.465 --> 02:01.991
Let him show us his worth.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.079
Yes.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.037
You'll accept me
into your order.

02:05.081 --> 02:08.171
And let him join.

02:08.215 --> 02:10.782
If he truly wishes
to join us.

02:10.826 --> 02:12.044
Yes.

02:12.088 --> 02:14.699
Yes, make me a Sister.

02:14.743 --> 02:16.484
I'll do anything you ask.

02:16.527 --> 02:20.052
Please. Make me a Sister.

02:20.096 --> 02:24.187
I will do anything you wish.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.407
Make me a Sister.

02:26.450 --> 02:31.586
Please. Make me a Sister.

02:31.629 --> 02:37.505
With my blood I'll mark you
with a symbol of our order

02:37.548 --> 02:40.334
This is a symbol
for your forehead.

02:40.377 --> 02:43.163
[breathing heavily]

02:44.294 --> 02:51.214
Now, I am truly one of you.

02:51.258 --> 02:53.651
Yes.

02:53.695 --> 02:57.568
Almost.

02:57.612 --> 03:00.528
Almost?

03:00.571 --> 03:03.226
What is almost?

03:03.270 --> 03:07.317
You are almost one of us.

03:07.361 --> 03:10.886
There's just one more
step to go.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.155
Comfort him now.

03:19.199 --> 03:23.986
Oh. Yes...

03:24.029 --> 03:26.162
Do it.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.860
Do it.

03:28.904 --> 03:32.255
Make me one of you.

03:32.299 --> 03:36.172
Make me a Sister!

03:36.216 --> 03:37.391
Yes!

03:38.305 --> 03:39.349
Yes!

03:40.263 --> 03:41.830
Yes.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.353
Yes.

03:43.397 --> 03:45.050
Yes

03:45.094 --> 03:47.488
[all sisters whispering]

03:47.531 --> 03:49.838
Yes! Yes!

03:49.881 --> 03:52.057

[sisters shrieking]

04:27.919 --> 04:29.269
Anyone see Axel yet?

04:29.312 --> 04:30.661
Not yet.

04:30.705 --> 04:31.445
Christina?

04:31.488 --> 04:34.404
No. Nothing yet.

04:34.448 --> 04:35.753
I'm gonna go wait
in my tent

04:35.797 --> 04:37.233
Alright.

04:53.945 --> 04:54.903
Hello?

04:54.946 --> 04:57.079
Oh that's good.
Oh that's good.

04:57.122 --> 04:58.602
Yeah?

04:58.646 --> 05:00.909
Good.

05:00.952 --> 05:05.261
Mary Beth? Is that you?

05:05.305 --> 05:07.132
No.

05:07.176 --> 05:12.486
[screaming]

05:16.185 --> 05:17.360
Oh my god.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.970
They're in the light!
It's not possible!

05:19.014 --> 05:20.668
It looks like
he's got Christina.

05:20.711 --> 05:23.584
It looks like she's been bit!

05:23.627 --> 05:24.541
They're everywhere!

05:24.585 --> 05:25.934
Oh my god,
oh my god.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.979
[snarling]

05:29.503 --> 05:30.417
Start fighting, assholes!

05:30.460 --> 05:32.070
Or you're all gonna die!

[panting]

07:49.294 --> 07:51.079
What?

07:51.122 --> 07:52.515
Nothing.

07:52.559 --> 07:56.171
Just, uh, glad you came back
when you did.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.742
Where's the other one,
what's her face...

08:01.785 --> 08:02.656
Christina?

08:02.699 --> 08:04.005
She didn't make it.

08:04.048 --> 08:06.486
Where's her body?

08:06.529 --> 08:09.053
She must have turned.

08:20.108 --> 08:21.979
What did I tell you
about food?

08:22.023 --> 08:24.155
Before I left to find diesel?

08:24.199 --> 08:26.941
Let me remind you,
I said wait until I got back

08:26.984 --> 08:30.161
because the smell could
attract them. Right?

08:30.205 --> 08:33.077
Goddamn it!

08:33.121 --> 08:34.470
I'm just an idiot for thinking

08:34.514 --> 08:37.560
I could leave you people alone
for five seconds.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.083
You said to me, Mary Beth,
you said to me.

08:39.127 --> 08:40.607
You remember.

08:40.650 --> 08:41.782
"We can't make it alone Ash!
What are we going to do?"

08:41.825 --> 08:43.087
"How are we gonna make it?"

08:43.131 --> 08:44.480
And I said "oh, no, no,
I got you. I got you.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.308
"I'll get you there!"

08:46.351 --> 08:49.050
Told you that, right?

08:49.093 --> 08:51.139
I meant all of you.

08:54.359 --> 08:55.230
Get all this shit packed up.

08:55.273 --> 08:56.144
Get it in the vehicle.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.319
We gotta get out of here

08:57.362 --> 08:58.320
They know were here now.

08:58.363 --> 08:59.495

12:07.074 --> 12:12.383
Well, hello asshole.

12:12.427 --> 12:16.474
Bet you don't feel so tough now,
do you?

12:16.518 --> 12:18.694
Thought you'd kill a bunch
of our friends and family

12:18.738 --> 12:22.567
and get away with it,
didn't ya?

12:22.611 --> 12:25.353
But you're not going
to get away with this.

12:25.396 --> 12:28.095
Cuz I'm gonna feed you
your balls

12:28.138 --> 12:30.793
before I rip your head off.

12:30.837 --> 12:33.709
You like that?

12:33.753 --> 12:42.152
Now, I don't know about him
but I love it.

Hey! Wanna play?

12:48.768 --> 12:49.638

Hey there.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.861
Hey.

It's me.

14:23.732 --> 14:24.733
Cara.

14:29.042 --> 14:32.567
I understand.

14:32.610 --> 14:35.004
You thought I died, right?

14:35.048 --> 14:36.745
You killed me?

14:36.788 --> 14:38.312
Don't worry, Mohamad!

14:38.355 --> 14:40.575
You did.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.142
You saved me.

14:44.666 --> 14:49.018
After all that time
you've played with my Sam.

14:49.062 --> 14:51.107
[sniffs]

14:51.151 --> 14:53.936
Sick.

14:53.980 --> 14:57.722
He's not here, right?

14:57.766 --> 14:59.376
Sam?

15:04.381 --> 15:05.992
[sighs]

15:06.035 --> 15:09.865
It's ok, Mohamad.
It is.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.954
I promise.

15:11.998 --> 15:15.088
Remember what Sam
used to tell you?

15:15.131 --> 15:17.307
To follow the mouse?

15:17.351 --> 15:20.702
Remember that, hmm?

15:20.745 --> 15:24.227
Well, that's what
you have to do.

Remember what I used to do?

16:54.578 --> 16:59.061
The water, on the boards?

16:59.105 --> 17:03.022
You have to figure it out.

17:03.065 --> 17:05.807
Find a way out of here.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.417
Make one.

[loud clanging sound]

17:35.184 --> 17:38.970
What do you think?

17:39.014 --> 17:41.625
You can do it.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.331
That's good.

17:51.374 --> 18:00.862
You can do it, Mohamad.

Yes?

19:09.017 --> 19:12.063
What do you want?

19:12.107 --> 19:13.935
It's your time now.

19:16.503 --> 19:19.288
Yes.

19:19.332 --> 19:20.724
For...

19:20.768 --> 19:25.903
You know, don't you?

19:25.947 --> 19:27.470
Yes. You do.

19:27.514 --> 19:32.780
No, I.. No, I don't.

19:32.823 --> 19:34.695
I don't!

19:34.738 --> 19:44.400
I've seen you there, in
the distance my whole life.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.359
And I don't know why.

19:46.402 --> 19:48.404
Think!

19:48.448 --> 19:52.016
Remember, can't you?

19:52.060 --> 19:56.891
Think back when I first
came to you.

20:03.027 --> 20:07.597
When I was a boy.
When I first--

20:14.561 --> 20:15.866
Yes.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.825
Yes.

20:17.868 --> 20:21.220
When I hurt someone.

20:21.263 --> 20:22.656
When I killed.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.487
Why did you come back?

20:27.530 --> 20:29.706
Because it is your time.

20:29.750 --> 20:35.103
Perhaps, to be the next.

20:35.146 --> 20:38.106
If you do all you need to do.

20:38.149 --> 20:41.414
All you must do.

20:41.457 --> 20:42.850
Do?

20:42.893 --> 20:44.504
What?

20:47.724 --> 20:49.248
[yells]
Tell me!

20:51.859 --> 20:53.295
Please?

20:54.427 --> 21:02.261
First, kill the one
you love.

21:15.839 --> 21:19.103
Kill.. the one...

21:38.427 --> 21:43.432
My sweet baby.

21:47.131 --> 21:51.353

No.

22:47.191 --> 22:51.500
That is not the one
you love.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.813
No.

23:02.206 --> 23:06.515
No!

You've broken through.

24:11.667 --> 24:14.627
You made a hole!

24:14.670 --> 24:17.151
Now you have to go out.

24:17.194 --> 24:20.154
That's how you get out,
Mohamad.

24:20.197 --> 24:22.243
You go up.

24:25.115 --> 24:26.421
Go on.

24:29.816 --> 24:33.515
[growling]

24:49.575 --> 24:51.664
Bye bye!

25:05.373 --> 25:07.201
Hey! Hey!

25:09.682 --> 25:10.639
[grunts]

25:10.683 --> 25:12.206
I was just resting

25:12.249 --> 25:14.077
You know if you're tired

25:14.121 --> 25:15.557
get in the back and switch out
with somebody

25:15.601 --> 25:18.604
I need eyes on these hills
at all times.

25:21.737 --> 25:24.479
You hear that,
everybody back there?

25:24.523 --> 25:26.089
[over radio] You all have
to be on guard.

25:26.133 --> 25:28.439
The second you feel tired
you swap out.

25:28.483 --> 25:30.093
Will do!

25:44.978 --> 25:48.372
What do we do?

25:48.416 --> 25:51.375
Looks like they need help.

25:51.419 --> 25:54.030
And what if he doesn't?

25:54.074 --> 25:55.858
Then he will when I'm through
with him.

25:55.902 --> 25:57.381
[laughs]

25:57.425 --> 25:58.948
Damn.

25:58.992 --> 26:02.561
You always have a way of making
everything sound so cool.

26:02.604 --> 26:05.694
That don't mean things
are cool.

26:05.738 --> 26:09.524
Why don't we just keep going?

26:09.568 --> 26:13.572
If it was us, would you want
them to stop?

26:15.051 --> 26:16.792
Ok. Whatever

26:16.836 --> 26:18.664
[Mary Beth] What's going on?

26:21.101 --> 26:24.626
Uh, it's just a truck
and some people

26:24.670 --> 26:28.151
I'm gonna go check it out,
you guys hang back here.

26:28.195 --> 26:29.413
Keep your weapons ready.

26:29.457 --> 26:33.417
If you hear me start firing,
come running.

26:45.952 --> 26:47.214
Let me come with you, Axel.

26:47.257 --> 26:49.825
I can put on my mask
and intimidate em!

26:49.869 --> 26:53.612
Yeah. Not this time, Barry.

26:53.655 --> 26:56.658
You stay here and watch
my back, alright?

27:10.063 --> 27:11.673
Hey there!

27:11.717 --> 27:13.762
Looks like you could use
some help.

27:13.806 --> 27:16.243
Hey! Thanks!

27:16.286 --> 27:17.679
Yeah, it couldn't hurt.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.899
None of us are car people
here, so...

27:19.942 --> 27:20.900
Kinda sucks!

27:20.943 --> 27:22.292
Oh yeah?

27:22.336 --> 27:24.207
Not a one of you
can change a tire?

27:24.251 --> 27:25.426
No, no. It's not that.

27:25.469 --> 27:27.646
We've got a spare
but the jacks busted.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.604
Oh, I could fix that
no problem.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.737
Great! Yeah,
we'd appreciate that.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.828
Ok.

27:35.871 --> 27:37.786
Coming over

27:41.094 --> 27:44.358
How many people you got
with you over there?

27:44.401 --> 27:45.794
Doesn't matter.

27:45.838 --> 27:48.405
You need help,
not an inventory right?

27:48.449 --> 27:51.452
Yeah no, absolutely,
just trying to be friendly.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.498
Where ya headed?

27:54.542 --> 27:55.978
We're going to San Fransisco.

27:56.022 --> 27:59.025
Oh, I'm sorry, been there.

27:59.068 --> 28:00.200
Forget about it.

28:00.243 --> 28:02.463
Ok thanks, but, we had
some intel

28:02.506 --> 28:03.682
and thats where we're going.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.292
No, I'm telling ya,
the place is overrun

28:05.335 --> 28:06.859
There's a ship,

28:06.902 --> 28:09.644
it's on its way there
with passage back to Hawaii.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.994
Nobody's infected in Hawaii.

28:12.038 --> 28:13.692
Taking our chances.

28:13.735 --> 28:17.783
Where exactly did you get
this intel?

28:17.826 --> 28:20.742
He was a radio operator
at a place we escaped from.

28:20.786 --> 28:23.571
It was a mining site
we were forced to work at.

28:23.614 --> 28:25.878
But we've got some crates of
ore that we took as payment.

28:25.921 --> 28:28.532
You mean you stole?

28:28.576 --> 28:29.708
No. That we took.

28:29.751 --> 28:32.754
As payment for the work
they made us do.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.147
Once we heard about the ship,
we took it.

28:34.190 --> 28:36.105
I can show you.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.248
We just want to get
out to sea.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.337
Away from this country
to someplace safe.

28:50.380 --> 28:52.165
That's it

28:56.560 --> 28:58.127
What's that do?

28:58.171 --> 28:59.259
Not sure.

28:59.302 --> 29:00.913
They sure seem to want it.

29:00.956 --> 29:02.175
Whoever they are.

29:02.218 --> 29:04.743
I'm pretty sure I know
who they are.

29:08.311 --> 29:11.010
Look, I can help you
fix the tire.

29:11.053 --> 29:14.622
That's not a problem
but, um, I gotta be honest,

29:14.665 --> 29:15.797
I think you should turn around
and head North.

29:15.841 --> 29:16.972
Follow us.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.191
But I don't know
about this boat thing,

29:18.234 --> 29:21.585
but I do know about
San Fransisco.

29:21.629 --> 29:23.022
Not to mention there's vampires
out there.

29:23.065 --> 29:24.806
There's literally
hundreds of them.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.460
They are walking in the day.

29:26.503 --> 29:28.418
They heal twice as fast
as they used to.

29:28.462 --> 29:31.639
We're just better off
if we stick together.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.510
Yeah, we appreciate that.

29:33.554 --> 29:37.427
But you know what, I think
we will just take our chances.

29:37.471 --> 29:39.038
You've got to be kidding me.

29:39.081 --> 29:41.562
Does this guy speak
for all of you?

29:42.868 --> 29:43.738
Man, we've got some room.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.871
Some of you can come with us.

29:47.786 --> 29:48.830
What about you?

29:48.874 --> 29:50.310
is this what you want to do?

29:50.353 --> 29:52.094
You think you should be headed
South in your condition?

29:52.138 --> 29:53.487
Oh, you're a doctor now?

29:53.530 --> 29:54.531
No, I'm not a doctor but
I'm smart enough to know--

29:54.575 --> 29:55.794
Hey!

29:55.837 --> 29:57.404
How about you just do
the tire thing, bud.

29:57.447 --> 29:59.928
You just do the tire thing and
then you leave my people alone.

29:59.972 --> 30:01.364
How about that?

30:01.408 --> 30:03.236
Well, first of all, my name
is not "bud" it's Axel.

30:03.279 --> 30:05.020
And I'm not trying to mess
with you people,

30:05.064 --> 30:09.155
I'm just saying I can see
what's ahead for her

30:09.198 --> 30:10.156
in the next couple months.

30:10.199 --> 30:11.244
She's gonna need some help.

30:11.287 --> 30:14.203
She's with us and she stays
with us.

30:14.247 --> 30:15.901
Is this what you want to do?

30:15.944 --> 30:16.684
You really want to...

30:16.727 --> 30:18.033
Just fix the tire, man!

30:18.077 --> 30:18.817
Come on man,
don't do that.

30:18.860 --> 30:19.643
Listen!

30:19.687 --> 30:23.865
Fix the tire then go away!

30:23.909 --> 30:25.171
I'm gonna give you
30 seconds

30:25.214 --> 30:26.346
and then there's no going back.

30:26.389 --> 30:28.914
Put your gun down!

30:28.957 --> 30:31.264
Put your goddamn weapon
on the ground!

30:31.307 --> 30:33.919
Hey, hey, hey.
Ok, ok.

30:33.962 --> 30:34.963
It's fine.

30:35.007 --> 30:36.138
[thud]

30:51.719 --> 30:54.722
Anybody else here want to talk
about this like a grownup?

30:55.505 --> 30:57.768
Look, it's ok.
I'm sorry.

31:01.555 --> 31:03.905
What happened down there?

31:03.949 --> 31:05.559
Fixed their tire.

31:17.658 --> 31:20.356
He wasn't as nice
as he looked.

31:28.538 --> 31:32.760
[branches breaking]

31:41.551 --> 31:44.424
[snarls]

32:16.760 --> 32:19.241
Sam...

32:43.396 --> 32:46.399
[retching]

32:57.018 --> 32:58.628
You alright?

33:01.501 --> 33:03.068
What's your name anyway?

33:03.111 --> 33:06.114
You can call me Kit.
That's what I go by.

33:06.158 --> 33:09.161
So, yeah.

33:09.204 --> 33:10.379
Kit, huh?

33:10.423 --> 33:12.729
Yeah.

33:12.773 --> 33:14.035
That's funny.

33:14.079 --> 33:17.256
What is?

33:17.299 --> 33:18.257
Oh nothing.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.999
No, go ahead.
Amuse me.

33:21.042 --> 33:24.045
Well, I'm not promising laugh
out loud hysterics right now.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.568
It's more of a coincidence.

33:25.612 --> 33:27.483
Ok, coincidence me then.

33:27.527 --> 33:30.399
Well, it's just that
your name is-

33:31.270 --> 33:32.619
Kit.

33:34.099 --> 33:37.928
And I happen to have
this here.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.495
No thanks.

33:39.539 --> 33:41.367
You kidding me?

33:41.410 --> 33:42.759
Yeah.

33:42.803 --> 33:44.065
Didn't you grow up in a family.
Strangers. Candy.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.762
That sort of deal.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.677
Well, it being a vampire
apocalypse and all,

33:47.721 --> 33:49.244
seems like you might
be able

33:49.288 --> 33:53.118
to make up a few
of your own rules.

33:53.161 --> 33:55.816
Maybe.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.252
Anyway, here.

33:57.296 --> 33:59.385
It's there if you want it.

34:11.049 --> 34:15.096
[devouring noises]

34:18.839 --> 34:20.623
Nah, nah, nah. It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

34:20.667 --> 34:23.496
I'll, I'll uh, chew on my shoe
later or something.

34:23.539 --> 34:24.758
Shit!

34:24.801 --> 34:26.760
Sorry, I didn't realize
you wanted anymore.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.414
I'm just kidding.

34:28.457 --> 34:29.154
Yeah?

34:29.197 --> 34:30.024
Yeah. It's fine.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.330
Honestly?

34:31.373 --> 34:35.769
Of course! It's all good.

34:35.812 --> 34:39.816
Anyway, thanks for the,
you know.

34:39.860 --> 34:42.906
It was good.

34:42.950 --> 34:45.692
Just try not to eat
the wrapper next time.

34:45.735 --> 34:47.259
[laughs]

34:51.872 --> 34:57.878
This space is mine alone.

34:57.921 --> 35:03.492
I come to you,
with thoughts.

35:03.536 --> 35:09.368
Say them then go!

35:09.411 --> 35:16.418
Many people, fresh meat,
gathering to the East.

35:16.462 --> 35:19.160
Many...

35:20.205 --> 35:22.250
Continue.

35:23.382 --> 35:25.732
I was with some...

35:25.775 --> 35:31.477
taking other there
before this...

35:31.520 --> 35:38.048
More? Say more!

35:38.092 --> 35:44.446
Far, far away...
was with sisters.

35:44.490 --> 35:52.150
Two sisters.
Vampire hunters!

35:53.412 --> 35:56.110
Van Helsing.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.938
Yes!

36:01.028 --> 36:06.903
Where to the East?

36:06.947 --> 36:07.948
Denver.

36:10.472 --> 36:12.996
Go now!

36:18.219 --> 36:21.048
It is time!

36:22.267 --> 36:24.965
My children...

36:25.008 --> 36:33.016
A new group of humans
to the East!

36:35.541 --> 36:43.984
I will go to our brothers
and sisters and we will feast!

36:44.027 --> 36:48.423

37:04.787 --> 37:10.967
[distant wailing sounds]

37:11.011 --> 37:12.969
Sisters.

37:13.796 --> 37:17.017
[yelling]

37:17.060 --> 37:18.453
Go!

37:48.831 --> 37:53.140

37:57.362 --> 37:59.538
I've been waiting for you.

38:01.714 --> 38:03.542
Sam.

38:03.585 --> 38:06.588
Go find him.

38:06.632 --> 38:08.373
You don't need me now.

38:08.416 --> 38:10.505
You can do it on your own

38:10.549 --> 38:11.985
Feed.

38:12.028 --> 38:13.378
Soon.

38:13.421 --> 38:16.816
Somethings are more important
than food.

38:16.859 --> 38:19.993
Kill Sam, Mohamad.

38:20.036 --> 38:22.517
Kill.

38:23.997 --> 38:27.305
[snarling]

38:36.923 --> 38:42.537
It's none of my business,
but, your uh, your baby.

38:47.063 --> 38:49.065
The father, is he, uh--

38:53.243 --> 38:55.245
One of you guys.

38:55.289 --> 38:57.073
First one died,
second one ran off.

38:57.117 --> 38:58.858
I liked the first one better
than the second

38:58.901 --> 39:01.513
but I don't really know
who's kid it is.

39:03.558 --> 39:05.168
Fair enough. I-

39:05.212 --> 39:06.300
End of discussion

39:10.043 --> 39:12.045
End of discussion.

39:18.268 --> 39:23.622
You obey my call.
Good.

39:25.841 --> 39:30.498
I obey only the Sisterhood.

39:30.542 --> 39:34.633
This is just merely payback
for your gift.

39:34.676 --> 39:36.722
Who among you turned her?

39:36.765 --> 39:38.463
I was the one who turned her.

39:38.506 --> 39:40.987
I know nothing of the others.

39:46.514 --> 39:50.649
Now tell us,
why are we here.

39:52.041 --> 39:57.438
Denver. Many humans.

39:57.482 --> 40:00.920
Think they are safe
above the clouds.

40:00.963 --> 40:03.923
Close to the sun.

40:05.490 --> 40:07.448
Go there!

40:07.492 --> 40:11.060
Take it from them.

40:11.104 --> 40:16.588
Show them that there
is nowhere left to hide.

40:16.631 --> 40:19.025
[vampires snarling]

40:20.200 --> 40:28.034
Remind them that the vampires
know who the world-

40:29.644 --> 40:31.820
It's a good plan.

40:31.864 --> 40:35.084
I like it.

40:35.128 --> 40:37.957
Do you now?

40:38.000 --> 40:40.829
Yes.

40:40.873 --> 40:43.484
There's just one thing.

40:43.528 --> 40:47.314
Anything.

40:47.357 --> 40:49.838
We don't need you.

40:51.666 --> 40:55.931
[grunts]

40:55.975 --> 40:59.892
[pained moan]

41:10.642 --> 41:13.471
[snarling]

41:21.566 --> 41:27.180
[yelling]

41:27.833 --> 41:29.791
Strong plan!

41:29.835 --> 41:32.707
Weak leader!

41:32.751 --> 41:36.406
The Sisterhood rules
you now!

41:37.712 --> 41:40.106
We go to the East.

41:40.149 --> 41:42.238
We kill humans!

41:42.282 --> 41:47.330
We drink their blood!

41:50.595 --> 41:55.730
But first, we've got
some work to do.

42:00.256 --> 42:06.349
[screams]

42:08.003 --> 42:10.615
[laughs]

42:10.658 --> 42:20.668
[screaming continues]
