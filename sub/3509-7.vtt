00:00.527 --> 00:01.476
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.533 --> 00:03.133
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.467 --> 00:05.193
Psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:05.431 --> 00:06.453
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.854 --> 00:08.593
Who am I?
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.683 --> 00:09.743
Castle.
Castle.

00:09.778 --> 00:11.478
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:11.532 --> 00:13.722
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:13.932 --> 00:14.751
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:14.998 --> 00:16.265
Beckett.
Aah!

00:16.538 --> 00:18.623
Beckett?
Could you get some backup, please?

00:18.974 --> 00:20.858
<i>And thanks to my friendship
with the Mayor,</i>

00:20.909 --> 00:22.543
<i>I get to be on her case.
Oh!</i>

00:22.577 --> 00:25.146
Do I look like a killer to you?
Yes, you kill my patience.

00:25.180 --> 00:26.814
<i>And together,
we catch killers.</i>

00:27.362 --> 00:30.264
I hate this case.
I know. Isn't it great?

00:50.327 --> 00:52.543
NYPD. Open up.

00:53.146 --> 00:55.948
I have an arrest warrant
for Jamie Ruiz.

01:02.533 --> 01:03.700
NYPD.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.341
Aah!

01:12.844 --> 01:16.379
Ho-haw! Ma-ma-ma-maw!

01:16.398 --> 01:18.015
Ho-haw!

01:18.049 --> 01:20.267
Ma-ma-ma-maw!

01:20.318 --> 01:22.686
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha!

01:22.720 --> 01:24.387
<i>And</i> relax.

01:24.406 --> 01:26.023
And relax.

01:26.057 --> 01:28.025
I had a dream.

01:28.059 --> 01:30.277
I was floating
on a Lily pad,

01:30.328 --> 01:32.229
and the Swedish bikini team

01:32.247 --> 01:34.731
was reciting positive reviews
of "Naked Heat."

01:34.783 --> 01:35.962
Oh. Well,
that must have been lovely.

01:36.062 --> 01:37.073
Yeah.

01:37.102 --> 01:39.069
Why are you
telling us this?

01:39.087 --> 01:40.465
Well, because of you,
my Swedish paradise

01:40.565 --> 01:42.104
turned into
a wailing cat shelter.

01:42.204 --> 01:43.655
We're doing voice exercises

01:43.755 --> 01:45.572
to strengthen
abdominal breathing.

01:45.659 --> 01:46.604
At 5:00 A.M.?

01:46.704 --> 01:50.707
Preparation is the foundation
of an inspired audition.

01:50.741 --> 01:52.075
Ha ha!

01:52.109 --> 01:53.676
Mm.

01:55.572 --> 01:58.113
I mentioned to gram last night
that I was thinking about

01:58.213 --> 01:59.565
trying out for "Grease"
at my school.

02:00.213 --> 02:02.197
Oh. The old
"gram goes overboard

02:02.232 --> 02:04.596
because acting is in your bones" routine.
Apparently.

02:04.634 --> 02:06.101
Yeah, yeah.

02:06.136 --> 02:08.103
Rookie move, telling her
about the audition.

02:08.138 --> 02:09.586
I wasn't sure I'd have time
with all my other clubs,

02:09.674 --> 02:11.231
but I thought
it might be fun.

02:11.597 --> 02:13.719
I didn't know she'd wake me up
when it was still dark outside.

02:13.765 --> 02:14.298
I see.

02:14.299 --> 02:17.517
An actor learns to make
sacrifices for his craft.

02:18.314 --> 02:20.798
Besides, we'll all have
plenty of time to sleep

02:20.816 --> 02:23.301
when we're dead.

02:26.405 --> 02:28.356
Oh, speaking of dead.

02:28.407 --> 02:29.908
Castle.

02:29.942 --> 02:33.278
Nah. No, no, don't be silly.
Of course I was up.

02:33.312 --> 02:35.030
Jeez.
What's the big hurry?

02:35.081 --> 02:37.248
Victim's not going anywhere,
right?

02:37.283 --> 02:38.750
This one's different.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.864
- Lanie.
- Heard we got an officer down.

02:41.134 --> 02:43.252
- Yep. That's the word.
- Who is it?

02:43.282 --> 02:45.900
Don't know, but a cab driver
called 9-1-1

02:45.985 --> 02:48.653
after he parked
and stopped for a smoke.

02:48.687 --> 02:50.705
Let's see.

02:53.292 --> 02:56.528
Single gunshot wound
to the chest.

02:56.562 --> 02:58.833
And our guy isn't wearing
his Kevlar.

02:58.933 --> 03:01.268
Mind if I step in there
for a sec?

03:07.199 --> 03:09.064
It's from the 116 in Queens.

03:09.164 --> 03:11.032
This is an old-style badge,
though.

03:11.066 --> 03:13.334
Maybe he's old-school, didn't
want to give up the badge

03:13.368 --> 03:14.440
he built his career on.

03:14.540 --> 03:15.996
Castle, he's mid-20s.

03:16.071 --> 03:19.239
You ever heard of a brilliant
doctor named Doogie Howser?

03:22.411 --> 03:25.547
It's fake.

03:27.450 --> 03:29.219
That's Tequila.

03:29.386 --> 03:31.525
That's cheap Tequila.

03:33.189 --> 03:34.935
And he needed a refill.

03:37.820 --> 03:39.433
So a squirt gun
and an old badge--

03:39.533 --> 03:41.501
clearly he's not a cop.

03:42.469 --> 03:45.090
Maybe he was impersonating one
to prey on vulnerable women.

03:45.190 --> 03:46.686
Armed with
a Tequila pistol?

03:46.923 --> 03:49.558
Actually, I think women
were preying on him.

03:50.632 --> 03:53.101
Tear away pants?

03:53.135 --> 03:55.803
He's a stripper.
I'm not finding any I.D.

03:57.573 --> 04:00.308
He does have a car.

04:04.513 --> 04:07.315
Of all the cases in the city,
and it's a big city,

04:07.333 --> 04:09.334
you catch a male stripper.

04:09.368 --> 04:11.319
Yeah. Well, luck of the draw,
I guess.

04:11.337 --> 04:13.487
Yeah. I'm--I'm just sayin'.

04:13.506 --> 04:15.557
I'm just sayin'.
Shotgun.

04:15.591 --> 04:17.454
Castle,
you're the only one here.

04:17.774 --> 04:19.160
Yes.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.098
Ew.

04:25.634 --> 04:27.880
This place reminds me
of my first dorm room.

04:35.554 --> 04:37.373
Victim's name
is Derek Brookner.

04:37.473 --> 04:39.140
He's 27.

04:41.979 --> 04:44.681
Hey. He wrote an address on
the back of this deposit slip.

04:44.715 --> 04:47.283
"423 West 59th. 4-B."

04:47.733 --> 04:49.246
That's right around
the corner.

04:49.398 --> 04:50.911
And his body
was found halfway between

04:51.011 --> 04:52.078
that location and this car.

04:52.178 --> 04:53.934
What do you want to bet
that's where he was coming from?

04:58.343 --> 05:01.913
NYPD. Open up!

05:05.762 --> 05:08.140
Still sleeping. Go away.

05:10.545 --> 05:12.045
Oh.

05:12.064 --> 05:14.682
Excuse me. Sorry.

05:14.716 --> 05:17.384
Wow.

05:17.402 --> 05:19.019
Oh.

05:19.054 --> 05:21.439
Wow.

05:21.490 --> 05:23.844
Wow. Wow.

05:24.054 --> 05:26.639
That--they--whoa.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.541
They make cakes in that shape?
That--

05:28.559 --> 05:30.176
ooh!

05:30.210 --> 05:32.812
Another stripper?

05:32.846 --> 05:35.265
Whoo! Take it off!
Whoo!

05:35.316 --> 05:37.817
Take it off. Take it--
mm-hmm.

05:37.851 --> 05:39.741
Ladies, I am not a stripper,
though I can understand

05:39.841 --> 05:41.054
how you'd make that mistake.

05:41.340 --> 05:44.055
NYPD--the ones
with the real guns.

05:44.155 --> 05:46.961
We're here to investigate
the murder of Derek Brookner.

05:47.092 --> 05:48.329
We believe
he was your entertainment

05:48.429 --> 05:49.680
for last night's soiree.

05:49.780 --> 05:51.670
Oh, my God.
Officer McNaughty?

05:51.770 --> 05:52.701
I need to know

05:52.714 --> 05:54.781
the exact time that he arrived
and left yesterday.

05:55.374 --> 05:58.175
- It was dark.
- And his dance was long.

05:58.210 --> 06:00.010
That's not all
that was long.

06:03.795 --> 06:06.463
All right, let's pack it up.
I think a trip

06:06.497 --> 06:08.702
down to the station
will jog everyone's memories.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.803
Could we stop
and get brunch on the way?

06:15.175 --> 06:17.727
Ohh.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.412
Ms. Lieberman,

06:19.925 --> 06:22.202
do you remember anything
about last night?

06:30.039 --> 06:32.007
Derek was still wearing
his costume

06:32.041 --> 06:34.476
when was killed last night,
and he never made it to his car,

06:34.511 --> 06:37.896
which makes your party the last
place that he was seen alive.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.882
Well, he seemed fine
when he left, right?

06:39.916 --> 06:41.400
- I mean...
- Yeah.

06:41.434 --> 06:42.835
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm.

06:42.935 --> 06:44.786
Were there any problems
at the party,

06:44.837 --> 06:47.238
any jealous husbands
or boyfriends that showed up?

06:47.256 --> 06:48.976
No, it was--
it was just the girls.

06:49.776 --> 06:50.976
Who arranged the gig?

06:51.075 --> 06:53.877
I did. Jam-Jamie's always
had a thing for cops.

06:53.911 --> 06:55.879
It might interest you to know,

06:55.913 --> 06:58.915
I'm an assistant volunteer
Homicide Detective myself.

07:01.469 --> 07:03.211
How'd you set it up?

07:03.234 --> 07:05.025
The same way
you'd order a pizza.

07:05.122 --> 07:06.772
I called this place
that I found online,

07:06.791 --> 07:08.758
Mucho Men,
and gave my credit card.

07:08.893 --> 07:12.262
300 bucks an hour to send
my best friend off in style.

07:12.296 --> 07:14.567
Did he mention where
he was going after that?

07:14.788 --> 07:16.789
We were all wasted
by the time he showed up.

07:16.823 --> 07:19.392
I mean, he could've told me
his life story,

07:19.426 --> 07:20.477
and I wouldn't remember.

07:20.577 --> 07:22.327
Wait, a bachelorette party,
male stripper,

07:22.427 --> 07:27.164
loads of alcohol... one of you
had to be taking pictures.

07:29.915 --> 07:31.898
Well, here is the last one.

07:31.917 --> 07:34.168
I figured Jamie could
refer back to these...

07:34.202 --> 07:36.670
When she's old
and bored of her <i>marriage.</i>

07:42.110 --> 07:45.446
Oh. Tequila shots.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.382
- They're treating him like a piece of meat.
- It's okay.

07:47.439 --> 07:49.908
It's what he's paid for.
He had fun, too.

07:58.533 --> 08:00.118
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop on that one.

08:02.647 --> 08:03.215
Well, it's a good thing

08:03.315 --> 08:04.960
you took 30 pictures
of that one pose.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.819
Can you enhance
the background?

08:06.853 --> 08:08.487
Over there,
behind the group.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.641
- Who is that woman?
- Uh, that's Camille.

08:12.692 --> 08:15.144
She's a friend of Jamie's
from high school.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.531
It looks as though
she and Derek know each other.

08:16.631 --> 08:18.187
She never
mentioned anything.

08:18.287 --> 08:19.487
Can you enhance her face?

08:21.953 --> 08:25.222
She wasn't at the apartment
this morning. Where is she?

08:25.257 --> 08:26.891
She left...

08:26.925 --> 08:30.111
Right after Officer McNaughty.

08:34.331 --> 08:36.895
Turns out...
Camille Roberts has a record.

08:37.332 --> 08:38.636
Five years ago,
an ex-boyfriend

08:38.736 --> 08:39.947
filed a restraining order
against her

08:40.047 --> 08:41.549
after she threw all his stuff
out the window.

08:41.671 --> 08:44.006
Well, as a man who's dated
several rabbit boilers,

08:44.039 --> 08:45.333
I can safely say,
been there.

08:45.433 --> 08:46.308
Yeah, but a restraining order

08:46.409 --> 08:47.846
doesn't mean
that she's our killer.

08:47.946 --> 08:49.146
Yeah, except that
her ex-boyfriend

08:49.246 --> 08:50.846
happens to be our vic.

08:54.184 --> 08:56.918
Picked up Camille Roberts
at a café where she waitresses.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.520
She's in
interrogation room one.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.466
All right. What did we find
from Derek's apartment?

09:00.537 --> 09:02.087
Mostly just old movie posters

09:02.122 --> 09:03.918
and a bunch of Donald Trump
books about finance.

09:04.018 --> 09:05.986
Maybe Derek dreams about
being an entrepreneur,

09:06.004 --> 09:08.320
or maybe he's just a fan
of "Celebrity Apprentice."

09:08.368 --> 09:09.318
Anything else?

09:09.418 --> 09:10.652
There was a day planner
with nothing in it

09:10.687 --> 09:12.735
but a business card for a guy
named Jesse Mandalay.

09:12.935 --> 09:14.573
All right, run it.
I'll talk to Camille.

09:16.593 --> 09:19.993
This is like a bad dream.
I can't believe he's dead.

09:19.998 --> 09:22.512
Why did you leave the party
right after Derek did?

09:22.573 --> 09:24.541
I needed
to get outta there.

09:24.575 --> 09:26.209
And where did you go?

09:26.244 --> 09:29.112
Home. I just wanted
to be alone.

09:29.146 --> 09:32.048
You didn't see him
afterwards?

09:32.083 --> 09:34.451
I turned the corner,
and he was gone.

09:35.835 --> 09:38.256
Wait. You don't think I had
something to do with this?

09:38.356 --> 09:40.319
Camille, he had
a restraining order against you.

09:40.419 --> 09:43.388
That was years ago. It was
just a big misunderstanding.

09:43.422 --> 09:45.447
Look, Derek broke my heart,
but then I got over it.

09:46.142 --> 09:48.893
This... doesn't look like
the face of a person

09:48.928 --> 09:50.528
who got over it.

09:51.699 --> 09:53.666
When he walked into the party

09:53.701 --> 09:55.402
and started ripping
his clothes off, it upset me,

09:55.449 --> 09:56.430
but I didn't kill him.

09:56.530 --> 09:58.789
Okay. Why don't we just
go over the facts?

09:59.628 --> 10:01.696
You had a volatile relationship
with him,

10:01.730 --> 10:04.432
you left the party
the same time that Derek left,

10:04.466 --> 10:06.417
and then he turned up dead.

10:06.468 --> 10:09.337
So why don't you just tell me
what was really going on?

10:09.371 --> 10:12.006
Nothing. I just couldn't
believe he was stripping.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.671
And why was that
a shock to you?

10:13.771 --> 10:15.378
We met in acting class.

10:16.029 --> 10:18.631
He was the one everyone thought
was gonna hit it big.

10:18.665 --> 10:21.634
When I confronted him about
giving up on his dream,

10:21.668 --> 10:23.502
he said he was stripping

10:23.537 --> 10:25.471
because he was so desperate
for money.

10:25.505 --> 10:26.622
Did he tell you why?

10:27.568 --> 10:29.569
He had some other
recurring gig,

10:29.603 --> 10:32.872
but... he said he had to quit
'cause it was gonna kill him.

10:39.034 --> 10:40.783
My instinct says it's not her.

Mine, too. But have C.S.U. check

10:42.524 --> 10:43.870
the clothes she was wearing
for gunshot residue.

10:44.039 --> 10:45.402
All right. Any luck
tracking down the gig

10:45.502 --> 10:46.624
that he was
telling Camille about?

10:46.724 --> 10:47.924
Derek has
a low-rent Theatrical Agent,

10:48.573 --> 10:50.359
says he hasn't booked anything
in over a year.

10:50.459 --> 10:52.794
He just e-mailed
Derek's acting reel.

10:52.845 --> 10:54.462
Here's a taste of his illustrious career.

10:54.513 --> 10:56.464
<i>Hey, there.</i>
<i>I'm just stopping a few couples</i>

10:56.515 --> 10:59.484
<i>to see if they've ever heard</i>
<i>of a product called Prolong.</i>

10:59.518 --> 11:02.754
<i>Are you kidding?</i>
<i>We just started using Prolong.</i>

11:02.772 --> 11:04.389
<i>Now...</i>

11:04.423 --> 11:07.692
<i>Things are really...</i>
<i>Looking up.</i>

11:09.015 --> 11:11.454
Prolong--now available
without a prescription.

11:11.554 --> 11:12.510
He also
did serious work.

11:13.149 --> 11:13.949
<i>Give me all your money</i>

11:13.956 --> 11:15.924
<i>and whatever parts you got</i>
<i>out there in that garage,</i>

11:15.958 --> 11:18.964
<i>and I'll consider not</i>
<i>putting one in your noggin'.</i>

11:19.705 --> 11:20.987
Billy Grimm is the leader

11:21.087 --> 11:22.821
of the Visi Goth
motorcycle gang.

11:22.855 --> 11:25.290
If you or anyone
has any information

11:25.324 --> 11:26.825
on this dangerous criminal,

11:26.859 --> 11:28.514
please contact
your local authority.

11:28.614 --> 11:31.330
Damn. I could see why the guy
had to strip to pay his bills.

11:31.430 --> 11:33.069
Well, I guess it's safe to say

11:33.169 --> 11:34.727
that the gig that he was
telling Camille about

11:34.827 --> 11:36.405
had nothing to do with his
acting pursuits,

11:36.406 --> 11:38.291
- so you guys head off to Mucho Men.
- Mucho Men?

11:38.374 --> 11:40.300
That's the place that booked him
for the bachelorette party.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.741
See if he had any regular stripping gigs...

11:41.841 --> 11:44.395
Or troubles there.
Beckett.

11:47.371 --> 11:49.405
He's not that handsome.

11:49.439 --> 11:51.908
You want my opinion?
300 bucks an hour--

11:51.942 --> 11:52.957
little steep.

11:53.057 --> 11:54.091
As the person in this room

11:54.165 --> 11:57.334
that's seen everything under
the sheet... Bargain.

11:59.235 --> 12:00.424
What else did you find?

12:01.053 --> 12:03.788
Take a look.

12:05.198 --> 12:06.933
A hair?

12:06.944 --> 12:08.945
Your vic has hair that's been
recently dyed gray.

12:08.980 --> 12:10.447
Looks like temporary hair dye

12:10.481 --> 12:12.449
that hasn't completely
washed out yet.

12:12.483 --> 12:14.651
Well, most men color
their hair to cover the gray.

12:14.685 --> 12:16.720
Well, some women want
Officer McNaughty,

12:16.754 --> 12:18.337
and some want an older guy
who knows mutual funds.

12:18.437 --> 12:19.973
You know, daddy issues.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.968
It's more likely he was
coloring it for an audition.

12:23.359 --> 12:26.552
Speaking of hair, this is
the more important hair

12:26.645 --> 12:28.258
that I found
on your vic's clothing.

12:28.304 --> 12:30.255
That <i>could</i>
belong to our killer.

12:30.306 --> 12:31.773
A long, blonde hair.

12:31.807 --> 12:33.308
Well, this could've come

12:33.342 --> 12:35.310
from one of the women
at the bachelorette party.

12:35.344 --> 12:37.679
That's what I thought
until I had it tested.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.681
Came back positive
for testosterone

12:39.715 --> 12:41.216
and anabolic steroids.

12:41.250 --> 12:44.953

I got guys here.

13:09.375 --> 13:11.810

13:14.914 --> 13:16.097
But, uh, your friend here--

13:16.257 --> 13:17.507
I got women requesting

13:17.532 --> 13:20.517
that skinny "Twilight" dude
like crazy.

13:21.915 --> 13:25.085
They're one size fits all.
We can pad if need be.

13:25.167 --> 13:27.602
Bathroom's down the hall

13:27.623 --> 13:29.811
Hey, NYPD.

13:30.505 --> 13:32.772
We have some questions
about Derek Brookner.

13:32.807 --> 13:35.442
My mistake. We're doing
open auditions today.

13:35.476 --> 13:37.777
I can assure you,
this would fit.

13:37.811 --> 13:40.914
That's what they all say.
What about Derek?

13:40.948 --> 13:42.707
Well, he was murdered.

13:42.807 --> 13:44.775
Wow. Derek was
one of my best guys.

13:44.809 --> 13:47.778
We think he took a job that
might have got him into trouble.

13:47.812 --> 13:49.280
What kind of work did you book
for him in the last month?

13:49.380 --> 13:50.580
He did the occasional, uh,

13:50.649 --> 13:52.583
"handsome guest"
at rich people parties.

13:52.717 --> 13:54.718
Other than that, it was all,
uh, bachelorette

13:54.736 --> 13:56.520
or rowdy birthday party stuff.

13:56.555 --> 13:58.522
What about
any male parties?

13:58.557 --> 14:00.999
Nah. Derek was
a women-only guy.

14:01.525 --> 14:03.098
He had contact with
a blond-haired man

14:03.198 --> 14:04.790
who was on steroids
the night he was killed.

14:04.890 --> 14:05.974
Any idea who that might be?

14:06.074 --> 14:07.374
Well, it could've been
someone at his other job.

14:07.697 --> 14:08.507
What other job?

14:08.607 --> 14:10.807
In addition to the private gigs,
he also danced at a club

14:10.808 --> 14:12.852
called The Package Store
a couple nights a week.

14:12.942 --> 14:14.129
Most of those guys are juicing.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.697
Anyone he didn't
get along with?

14:16.449 --> 14:19.452
People think women are catty,
but, uh, from what Derek said,

14:19.486 --> 14:21.420
those guys
would make "Showgirls"

14:21.455 --> 14:23.789
look like
an after-school special.

14:23.807 --> 14:25.424
Thanks for your time.

14:25.458 --> 14:27.306
Hey, if, uh,
you change your mind,

14:27.406 --> 14:30.525
I'll provide fangs
and some hair gel.

Certainly not long blond hair.

14:45.716 --> 14:47.554
Well, maybe these are

14:47.654 --> 14:48.854
It's possible
they change their style

14:48.985 --> 14:50.953

The booking Agent mentioned

14:50.987 --> 14:53.656
the "Twilight" look is big right now.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.011

19:52.429 --> 19:55.896
with women shoving bills
down my shorts.

19:55.996 --> 19:57.880
Do you really think
I'd kill somebody over that?

19:57.940 --> 19:59.442
That doesn't change the fact,
we can place you

19:59.531 --> 20:01.499
at the scene of the crime.
Because of my hair?

20:01.533 --> 20:04.001
All that proves is that
we keep our costumes

20:04.035 --> 20:06.087
in the same big closet
backstage.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.005
Hell, I'm using minoxidil
twice a day

20:08.039 --> 20:08.862
just to keep it on my head.

20:08.962 --> 20:10.074
Where were you last night?

20:10.175 --> 20:12.476
I was onstage doing shows
from 8:00 till 1:00.

20:12.511 --> 20:15.012
There are over 100 women
who witnessed it.

20:15.942 --> 20:18.077
His alibi is as hard
as his abs.

20:18.111 --> 20:20.446
Did you talk
to his girlfriend?

20:20.480 --> 20:22.548
What girlfriend?

20:22.582 --> 20:24.583
Some rich cougar
who was obsessed with him.

20:24.618 --> 20:27.553
It was obvious Derek was
using her for the money,

20:27.587 --> 20:29.965
but I guess he got fed up with
her and kicked her to the curb.

20:30.065 --> 20:30.968
How do you know that?

20:31.068 --> 20:33.862
She always sent expensive
bouquets to his dressing room.

20:34.572 --> 20:36.079
And then last week,

20:36.179 --> 20:39.333
for the first time in months,
no flowers.

20:44.971 --> 20:46.904
Yo, what's up?
You run outta singles?

20:46.923 --> 20:49.442
Hey, Hans was right. We found
a flower shop that confirmed

20:49.542 --> 20:51.827
weekly deliveries
for the past four months.

20:51.861 --> 20:54.363
I knew if we beat on Mannschaft,
something would pop.

20:54.397 --> 20:56.175
Who were they sent to?

20:56.245 --> 20:59.230
They were charged to an Amex
belonging to Rebecca Dalton, 48.

20:59.265 --> 21:01.700
She lives at 63rd and Madison.
Yo.

21:01.734 --> 21:05.941
Check this out. Fortune 500
lists Rebecca Dalton's husband

21:06.041 --> 21:08.175
as having a publishing empire
in 2005.

21:08.209 --> 21:11.245
It says here that Rebecca
used to be a runway model.

21:11.279 --> 21:13.280
She's married. Juicy.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.316
Mnh-mnh. Not anymore.

21:15.350 --> 21:17.318
Her husband died
a couple of years ago.

21:17.352 --> 21:20.020
Left his entire fortune
to his grieving wife.

21:20.055 --> 21:22.222
Even more juicy.

21:22.257 --> 21:23.891
Rebecca marries young,

21:23.925 --> 21:25.893
spends her 20s and 30s
under the thumb

21:25.927 --> 21:27.895
of a rich
yet domineering husband.

21:27.929 --> 21:31.365
Well, he dies,
leaving our aging beauty

21:31.399 --> 21:34.702
finally freed from the shackles
of a loveless marriage.

21:34.736 --> 21:37.705
One night she's out with
her ex-model posse.

21:37.739 --> 21:40.708
She meets the very charming,
very handsome Derek.

21:40.742 --> 21:42.710
Well, for the first time
in years,

21:42.744 --> 21:46.380
she feels...
Alive again.

21:46.414 --> 21:48.582
The relationship reaches
its inevitable conclusion

21:48.616 --> 21:51.885
when Derek meets someone
closer to his own age.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.455
Well, the--the heartache

21:54.489 --> 21:56.590
has Rebecca so distraught

21:56.624 --> 21:59.326
that she kills Derek
in a jealous rage.

21:59.361 --> 22:02.830
If she couldn't have him...

22:02.864 --> 22:04.739
Well, then no one could.

22:05.023 --> 22:06.991
Did you go home and watch
"Sunset Boulevard"

22:07.025 --> 22:08.256
before your little trip
to The Package Store?

22:08.466 --> 22:10.401
Thank you for your
always entertaining stories,

22:10.435 --> 22:13.103
but I think we will get
a lot closer to the truth

22:13.138 --> 22:15.839
if we just ask Rebecca a few
questions tomorrow morning.

22:18.640 --> 22:19.744
It was good, though, right?
Yeah, I liked it.

22:19.844 --> 22:21.862
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
It was, yeah.

22:24.333 --> 22:26.501
Well... Mm-hmm.
Hey.

22:26.535 --> 22:27.669
Are you guys celebrating
with root beer floats,

22:27.769 --> 22:29.081
and nobody told me?

22:29.181 --> 22:31.610
I wish. They narrowed
the part of Sandy

22:31.710 --> 22:34.578
down to Kelly Burton
and yours truly.

22:34.613 --> 22:36.647
We're taking a little break,
but I'm really nervous.

22:36.681 --> 22:39.283
That's why we're running lines
in costume.

22:39.317 --> 22:40.703
Tomorrow
it'll be second nature.

22:40.803 --> 22:42.203
Well, I see you've dug up
your time capsule

22:42.287 --> 22:43.237
to resurrect those pants.

22:43.437 --> 22:44.388
I will have you know,

22:44.389 --> 22:47.691
I had some of my best memories
happen in these pants.

22:47.726 --> 22:49.744
<i>And</i> ew.
Cha.

22:49.795 --> 22:51.746
I'm off to bed.
Big day tomorrow.

22:51.797 --> 22:53.748
- Okay, darling.
- Thank you.

22:53.799 --> 22:55.466
Sleep well. Oh.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.535
Whatever happens,
I am so proud of her.

22:58.635 --> 23:00.636
She is fearless.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.305
You know, mother,

23:02.339 --> 23:04.974
I think you're a really good
influence on Alexis.

23:05.008 --> 23:07.477
What's with you, kiddo?
Fever, delirium?

23:07.511 --> 23:09.178
No, no, no, I'm serious.

23:09.212 --> 23:11.681
You have always been...
Dedicated,

23:11.715 --> 23:14.150
and that--that can't
have been easy.

23:14.184 --> 23:17.153
Well, yeah, it hasn't always
been days of wine and roses.

23:17.187 --> 23:19.689
I had to take a lot
of less-than-prestigious jobs

23:19.723 --> 23:22.558
to ply my craft.
Such as?

23:22.593 --> 23:24.594
Oh, lord. I played an elf.
Ugh.

23:24.628 --> 23:26.629
Santa's village.
Uh, Lady Liberty.

23:26.663 --> 23:29.665
Lady Liberty outside
some low-rent tax service,

23:29.700 --> 23:31.167
and then--oh, no.

23:31.201 --> 23:33.169
The worst job--
the worst job I ever had--

23:33.203 --> 23:34.705
I was terrible at it,
they hated me, it just--

23:34.755 --> 23:36.971
I-I was--it was absolutely
the--just completely--

23:37.071 --> 23:38.225
What was it?

23:39.207 --> 23:40.640
Secretary.

23:42.267 --> 23:43.944
You'd be terrible at that.

23:44.044 --> 23:45.595
Awful.

23:49.785 --> 23:52.686
Oh, I'm sure many a pretty boy
have walked this hall.

23:52.705 --> 23:55.689
Doesn't take 'em long to realize
that they're trapped

23:55.708 --> 23:58.292
in the strangling embrace
of an aging spinster.

23:58.327 --> 24:00.294
Maybe we should talk with her

24:00.329 --> 24:01.765
<i>before</i> you start writing
the Lifetime Movie.

24:01.965 --> 24:04.733
Ooh. Quick casting idea--
Ashton and Demi.

24:04.768 --> 24:06.702
Mm.

24:06.736 --> 24:09.471
NYPD. We're here
to speak with Rebecca Dalton.

24:09.489 --> 24:10.973
Please come in.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.975
I'm Ms. Dalton's attorney,
Michael Grant.

24:13.009 --> 24:16.579
I'll be sitting in
on the interview.

24:16.613 --> 24:19.698
I bumped into Derek
at a fund-raiser.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.751
He later admitted that
he had been hired by the host

24:22.786 --> 24:26.195
to mingle and encourage people
to bid on the silent auction.

24:26.361 --> 24:27.819
But it was too late.
I already liked him.

24:27.919 --> 24:29.374
And when you found out
he was a stripper?

24:29.474 --> 24:31.441
I never found out.
He told me.

24:31.476 --> 24:34.177
He never hid
any of that from me.

24:34.212 --> 24:36.897
It gave him the freedom
to pursue his acting career,

24:36.948 --> 24:39.516
audition during the day,
and I respected his tenacity.

24:39.551 --> 24:41.652
What caused the breakup?

24:41.686 --> 24:43.420
The relationship
had run its course.

24:44.787 --> 24:47.089
That sounds like something
that you would say

24:47.123 --> 24:50.158
when you're lying,
either to yourself or to us.

24:50.192 --> 24:53.695
You don't really think I had
anything to do with his death?

24:53.713 --> 24:56.265
I just find it curious that
right after you've split up,

24:56.299 --> 24:57.933
he's found dead.

24:57.967 --> 25:00.495
Who broke it off?

25:00.595 --> 25:01.576
My client did.

25:01.676 --> 25:02.763
Why?

25:02.764 --> 25:06.033
Last week, he asked my client
to borrow $25,000.

25:06.068 --> 25:08.035
I've learned,
it's never a good idea

25:08.070 --> 25:10.171
to mix relationships
with money.

25:10.205 --> 25:12.406
Intentions get foggy.

25:12.441 --> 25:14.001
And why did he need
the money?

25:14.101 --> 25:15.243
He wouldn't say.

25:15.344 --> 25:17.745
And to make matters worse,
he seemed distant.

25:17.779 --> 25:19.413
You thought he was cheating.

25:19.448 --> 25:21.615
It occurred to me,
and I'm not proud of it,

25:21.650 --> 25:23.617
but I had Michael hire
a private investigator.

25:23.652 --> 25:25.286
I had to know.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.621
When my client saw
the photographs, she realized

25:27.656 --> 25:29.824
Derek was mixed up with
some disreputable people.

25:29.858 --> 25:33.127
And what made you think
it was a bad element?

25:33.161 --> 25:35.830
Because Derek didn't hang out
with people like that.

25:35.864 --> 25:38.665
He was a good kid
from Michigan.

25:38.684 --> 25:41.168
If they had something to do
with his murder,

25:41.186 --> 25:43.170
I'd have taken
my decision back

25:43.188 --> 25:45.840
and given him the money
in a heartbeat.

25:45.874 --> 25:49.393
I'm gonna need to see
those photos.

25:49.444 --> 25:51.395
The P.I. took a picture

25:51.446 --> 25:53.397
of Derek
talking to this woman,

25:53.448 --> 25:54.617
and then he followed her
to the next location.

25:55.617 --> 25:57.062
So Derek
is outside his apartment

25:57.118 --> 25:58.586
talking to bombshell McGee.

25:58.520 --> 25:59.570
What's so dangerous
about that?

25:59.670 --> 26:00.870
Wait a minute.

26:02.686 --> 26:05.888
Ryan, can you pull up
Derek's acting reel?

26:05.923 --> 26:07.423
Man, once was bad enough.

26:07.523 --> 26:09.708
<i>Give me all your money</i>
<i>and whatever parts</i>

26:09.742 --> 26:11.727
<i>you got out there</i>
<i>in that garage,</i>

26:11.761 --> 26:15.697
<i>and I'll consider not puttin'</i>
<i>one in your noggin'.</i>

26:15.715 --> 26:17.365
Billy Grimm is the--

26:19.168 --> 26:22.204
That's the same guy
as the mug shot.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.474
Billy Grimm--

26:25.508 --> 26:30.345
leader of the Visi Goths
motorcycle gang.

26:30.379 --> 26:32.130
Billy Grimm's rap sheet.

26:33.015 --> 26:35.717
Extortion, assault with
a deadly weapon, armed robbery.

26:35.735 --> 26:37.219
When Derek's episode

26:37.253 --> 26:39.071
of "America's Most Dangerous
Criminals" aired,

26:39.105 --> 26:40.460
Grimm had an attempt murder
warrant out.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.180
Apparently some guy owed him
money, so he chained him

26:42.280 --> 26:45.332
to the back of his bike
and dragged him down the L.I.E.

26:45.333 --> 26:46.343
Why isn't this psycho Grimm
in jail?

26:46.475 --> 26:48.213
He was, as a matter of fact,
he was caught

26:48.460 --> 26:50.411
because of Derek's reenactment
on the show.

26:50.445 --> 26:53.047
But the guy he chained to his
bike had a change of heart,

26:53.081 --> 26:56.117
refused to testify, so Grimm
was recently released from jail.

26:56.151 --> 26:57.222
Well, if this guy
was such a whack job,

26:57.322 --> 26:59.891
what was Derek doing talking to
one of the members of his gang?

27:00.158 --> 27:02.109
I think I can answer that.
When Grimm was arrested,

27:02.160 --> 27:04.111
a reporter
asked him how he felt

27:04.162 --> 27:06.979
about being brought to justice
by a TV show.

27:07.079 --> 27:09.364
He swore vengeance against
those who put him jail,

27:09.415 --> 27:11.649
especially--and Grimm says,

27:11.667 --> 27:14.752
"that actor that made me look
like a clown."

27:14.787 --> 27:15.908
I can tell you this
about Visi Goths

27:16.008 --> 27:17.544
from my gang task force days--

27:17.644 --> 27:19.111
they're serious
about their colors.

27:19.145 --> 27:21.113
These patches
they wear on their vests?

27:21.147 --> 27:21.913
They're not varsity letters.

27:22.013 --> 27:24.014
They gotta spill blood
to get 'em.

27:24.048 --> 27:25.565
And some guy wearing 'em
on national TV?

27:25.665 --> 27:26.865
So she was setting him up...

27:29.073 --> 27:30.974
For murder.

28:08.258 --> 28:10.250
about your association
with Derek Brookner.

28:11.969 --> 28:13.035
Never heard of the guy.

28:13.135 --> 28:15.871
I make one phone call, and auto
theft detail is down here

28:15.905 --> 28:17.472

28:34.968 --> 28:36.418
that you had something

Derek wore the colors,

28:37.537 --> 28:38.684

That's why you put
a contract out on him.

28:41.530 --> 28:44.048
Well, I might have been
a little pissed off.

28:44.099 --> 28:46.050
But the kid came with respect.

28:46.101 --> 28:48.052
He brought a donation.

28:48.103 --> 28:50.071
A donation? What are you,
The Salvation Army?

28:50.105 --> 28:52.640
Well, I was surprised, too,
but I guess Derek felt

28:52.674 --> 28:54.722
25 g's might help
bring down my overhead.

28:54.890 --> 28:57.024

expect me to believe

28:57.042 --> 28:59.026

29:01.130 --> 29:02.630
That's what happened.

29:02.664 --> 29:04.005
Where did he get

29:04.105 --> 29:06.474
I didn't ask to see

Ain't my business
how he got the money.

29:08.675 --> 29:11.210
He brought the cash,
and that was good enough.

29:11.245 --> 29:13.479
Aren't you forgetting
the part about the extortion,

29:13.513 --> 29:15.781
the part where you asked your
girlfriend to deliver a message

29:15.816 --> 29:18.434
that Derek had to pay you
25 grand?

29:18.485 --> 29:19.789
You gave him a week to do it.

29:19.889 --> 29:21.269
He couldn't scrape together
the money,

29:21.369 --> 29:23.938
and so you killed him.

29:30.957 --> 29:32.824
Babe, what is this?

29:32.858 --> 29:34.659
I can explain.

29:34.694 --> 29:36.962
What the hell were you doing
talking to that bitch?

29:36.996 --> 29:38.118
Listen,
when you got outta jail,

29:38.218 --> 29:40.389
I got nervous you were
gonna do something stupid,

29:40.489 --> 29:42.963
so I went to talk to the kid,
told him if he didn't want

29:43.063 --> 29:46.128
any trouble, he'd bring you
a preemptive donation.

29:46.165 --> 29:48.166
So you warned him?
That's why he showed up here?

29:48.200 --> 29:51.002
I couldn't stand the thought
of losing you again.

29:51.036 --> 29:54.722
The only way you're going back
to jail is over my dead body.

29:56.512 --> 29:59.147
Pookiebear...

29:59.182 --> 30:03.084
That is the most romantic thing
I've ever heard, baby.

30:03.102 --> 30:04.586
Come here.

30:04.604 --> 30:06.921
Mm.

30:06.940 --> 30:08.640
♪

30:08.691 --> 30:10.642
mm.

30:10.693 --> 30:12.562
♪

30:12.657 --> 30:14.925
Hey. Billy's alibi
checked out.

30:14.959 --> 30:17.094
Bartender confirmed that he was
shooting pool till close.

30:17.128 --> 30:19.596
Yeah, and we talked to
our C.I., and there's no word

30:19.631 --> 30:22.165
of our victim hitting up
any of the usual loan sharks.

30:22.183 --> 30:23.986
You know what I want to know
is how a stripper comes up

30:24.086 --> 30:25.499
with that kind of cash
in such a hurry?

30:25.599 --> 30:27.055
Cash-n-Gold.

30:27.443 --> 30:29.243
Castle, you watch
way too many infomercials.

30:29.278 --> 30:31.646
We also checked his account
at JLP Bank Corp.

30:31.680 --> 30:33.082
He never carried
an account balance

30:33.096 --> 30:34.080
of more than
a couple thousand dollars.

30:34.180 --> 30:37.532
Wait a minute. If Derek had
an account with JLP Bank Corp.,

30:37.566 --> 30:41.069
why was there a deposit slip
from Rampart Federal in his car?

30:43.350 --> 30:45.332
Let's run down withdrawals
for 25 grand

30:45.432 --> 30:46.899
from Rampart Federal branches

30:46.933 --> 30:48.719
for the day
that Derek paid Billy.

30:48.819 --> 30:51.470
I don't know
how you missed that.

30:53.338 --> 30:54.217
Yo.

30:54.749 --> 30:58.001
Rampart Federal on 93rd
posted a transaction that size,

30:58.052 --> 31:01.354
made by a Jesse Mandalay
at 11:53 A.M. that day.

31:01.389 --> 31:02.439
Derek had a card

31:02.539 --> 31:04.506
for Jesse Mandalay
tucked inside one of his books.

31:04.541 --> 31:05.807
I called the number.
It was disconnected.

31:05.907 --> 31:06.942
It's possible that Mandalay

31:07.043 --> 31:08.279
was the one
that loaned Derek the money.

31:08.379 --> 31:10.631
Maybe Derek thought he was on
a flexible payment plan,

31:10.731 --> 31:12.687
needed more time,
and Mandalay killed him for it.

31:12.787 --> 31:14.489
Well, the bank is sending over
the surveillance footage

31:14.589 --> 31:16.957
of Mandalay right now.

31:21.932 --> 31:25.931
Here we go. There's Mandalay
taking the cash.

31:26.266 --> 31:27.051
Yeah,
by the looks of that suit,

31:27.151 --> 31:29.052
the loan business
must be pretty lucrative.

31:29.330 --> 31:30.433
Okay, let's see
this guy's face.

31:31.629 --> 31:32.401
Wait, wait, wait.

31:32.415 --> 31:35.383
That's not Jesse Mandalay.
That's Derek with gray hair.

31:36.740 --> 31:39.575
Jesse Mandalay is Derek.

31:45.755 --> 31:47.972
The branch manager said
that Derek withdrew money

31:49.977 --> 31:50.435
from an account
called Sunfire Limited.

31:50.535 --> 31:52.379
And his alter ego
Jesse Mandalay?

31:52.479 --> 31:54.967
Was the signatory,
but the rest is a mystery.

31:55.226 --> 31:57.760
Sunfire is linked
to an offshore account,

31:57.795 --> 32:00.163
and the only person that they
can trace it to is Mandalay.

32:00.197 --> 32:02.428
A money trail that leads back
to a man who doesn't exist.

32:02.528 --> 32:04.496
Derek was dyeing
his hair gray,

32:04.530 --> 32:07.499
wearing fancy suits
to look more distinguished,

32:07.533 --> 32:10.502
and he was reading books
on finance and investment

32:10.536 --> 32:15.838
so that he could play the role
of Jesse Mandalay for someone.

32:16.605 --> 32:19.574
But why hire a struggling actor
to play a businessman?

32:19.608 --> 32:22.827
I did some research on
Chinese companies that would,

32:22.878 --> 32:24.846
uh, sometimes hire
a-a white man

32:24.880 --> 32:27.848
to pose as an executive at, uh,
ribbon cutting ceremonies,

32:28.002 --> 32:29.136
uh, shareholder meetings,

32:29.158 --> 32:30.992
just to instill confidence
in investors.

32:31.027 --> 32:34.068
Likewise, a college student
seeking Venture Capital

32:34.168 --> 32:36.553
will sometimes hire
an older-looking shill,

32:36.587 --> 32:38.454
you know, someone who looks
more, uh, distinguished

32:38.554 --> 32:39.683
to help them secure money.

32:39.783 --> 32:42.578
So if Derek was hired to be
the face of the company,

32:42.678 --> 32:43.912
then whoever hired him

32:43.923 --> 32:45.891
was the person
behind the bank account.

32:45.925 --> 32:48.193
Let's see if we can
track down any checks

32:48.228 --> 32:50.562
that were deposited
into Sunfire Limited recently.

32:50.596 --> 32:53.532
If we can trace the money,
maybe we can figure out

32:53.566 --> 32:56.535
if Jesse Mandalay
was a role to die for.

32:56.569 --> 33:00.939
Yeah. That's Mandalay.
100%. Why?

33:00.974 --> 33:03.509
Miss Lombardo, we need to know
about the $10,000 check

33:03.543 --> 33:05.179
that you wrote him
a couple of days ago.

33:05.279 --> 33:06.503
Sure.
Best money I ever spent.

33:06.603 --> 33:07.803
What was the money for?

33:08.416 --> 33:09.866
An exciting
investment opportunity.

33:09.917 --> 33:11.985
My girlfriend Sammi heard from
her boyfriend Ronni

33:12.019 --> 33:13.987
who heard
from his cousin Pauly

33:14.021 --> 33:15.922
about Mr. Mandalay's
presentation.

33:15.957 --> 33:17.924
And what was the sales pitch?

33:17.959 --> 33:19.926
The beautiful Braverman Lofts

33:19.961 --> 33:21.962
in idyllic riverfront Hoboken.

33:21.996 --> 33:23.427
And Mandalay
was there himself?

33:24.208 --> 33:25.322
He gave us the awesome news

33:25.422 --> 33:27.258
that if we put down
the $10,000 that day,

33:27.358 --> 33:30.494
we could purchase a loft
for $400,000.

33:31.635 --> 33:32.861
A riverfront loft?

33:32.961 --> 33:34.586
I know. Amazing, right?

33:34.897 --> 33:38.366
Uh, um... amazing is--
is one word for it, yes.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.801
Yeah, you have to be, like,
a freakin' bonehead

33:40.819 --> 33:42.318
to pass up
on a deal like that.

33:42.418 --> 33:44.489
Did anyone else
at the presentation hand over

33:44.589 --> 33:45.505
a check to Mandalay that day?

33:45.605 --> 33:48.754
Uh, everyone.
My dad was pretty butt sore

33:48.854 --> 33:50.437
that I took the money
out of my college fund,

33:50.537 --> 33:52.319
but when I explained
that it would fold

33:52.419 --> 33:53.886
into the purchase price,

33:53.921 --> 33:56.822
he recognized that business
smarts runs in our family.

33:56.857 --> 33:58.291
Let me guess.

33:58.325 --> 34:00.960
The, uh, the contract
is in the mail, right?

34:06.900 --> 34:08.868
Yeah, this is it.
The Braverman Lofts.

34:08.902 --> 34:14.239
And that must be
the showroom.

34:14.274 --> 34:17.376
Oh.

34:17.411 --> 34:21.313
$400,000 for one of these?
I'll take 2.

34:21.331 --> 34:22.982
Castle, let's go.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.650
Excuse me.

34:24.668 --> 34:26.452
Can I help you?

34:26.485 --> 34:28.454
NYPD. Who's in charge here?

34:28.487 --> 34:31.958
I am. I'm the developer--
Bert Kramer.

34:31.992 --> 34:34.927
We're here about Jesse Mandalay.
Do you know him?

34:34.962 --> 34:37.929
Unfortunately, and if I ever
see that guy again, I'm gonna

34:37.965 --> 34:39.991
bust him in the jaw for all
the crap he put me through.

34:40.091 --> 34:40.922
Let me guess.

34:40.967 --> 34:42.935
He took advantage of you.
Damn right.

34:42.969 --> 34:44.904
He tried to sell my friggin'
property like it was his.

34:44.938 --> 34:47.556
Showed up here claiming to be
a real estate Agent,

34:47.608 --> 34:50.476
and he had this rap about
all these properties he's sold.

34:50.510 --> 34:51.831
And you gave him access
to the building?

34:51.931 --> 34:53.992
Well, he wanted to bring
a caravan of clients through,

34:54.092 --> 34:56.076
and he insisted
it be on a Sunday,

34:56.094 --> 34:58.078
so I gave him
the lockbox codes.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.289
How did you find out
he wasn't legit?

34:59.389 --> 35:00.589
Ever since that day,

35:00.605 --> 35:03.441
I got people showing up saying
they got the Mandalay deal

35:03.475 --> 35:05.109
and threatening to sue.

35:05.143 --> 35:07.111
Well,
we have reason to believe

35:07.145 --> 35:09.380
that Mandalay was working
with a partner.

35:09.414 --> 35:11.382
Did anyone else contact you?

35:11.416 --> 35:13.150
Uh, no.

35:13.185 --> 35:16.153
And when the tents folded up,
it was radio silence.

35:16.188 --> 35:18.222
But I did call
some of the other developers,

35:18.256 --> 35:20.207
and sure enough,
this Mandalay guy,

35:20.258 --> 35:22.209
he brought caravans
to their properties.

35:22.260 --> 35:25.830
Now they're dealing
with the same mess.

35:25.864 --> 35:28.165
Do you have any brochures?

35:28.200 --> 35:30.601
I'm looking for a place.
Mine blew up.

35:30.635 --> 35:32.470
10 grand a pop

35:32.504 --> 35:33.971
all over Jersey.

35:34.005 --> 35:35.473
That adds up quick.

35:35.507 --> 35:37.475
I don't understand
why Derek was still working

35:37.509 --> 35:39.477
as a stripper
the night that he was killed

35:39.511 --> 35:40.977
if he was involved in a scam

35:41.077 --> 35:42.269
that was raking in
that much money.

35:42.369 --> 35:43.913
Because he wasn't the one
raking in all the dough.

35:43.931 --> 35:45.848
He was just the actor,
hired for his looks

35:45.883 --> 35:48.334
and his personality
to charm the investors.

35:48.369 --> 35:50.937
So all along, Derek sees his partner
taking the money to the bank...

35:50.938 --> 35:52.924
And when he gets in trouble
with the bikers

35:53.024 --> 35:54.550
and suddenly he needs cash...

35:54.650 --> 35:56.911
He raids the bank account for
the 25 grand that he needs,

35:57.011 --> 35:58.528
and his partner
figures it out.

35:58.628 --> 35:59.728
Which leads
to a heated confrontation

36:00.086 --> 36:02.053
where he admits
to borrowing the money,

36:02.088 --> 36:04.467
but... but he says
he's pulling out of the scam.

36:08.844 --> 36:10.178
Beckett.

36:12.098 --> 36:13.932
Got it. Thanks.

36:15.301 --> 36:17.268
Ryan and Esposito did
a little bit of digging,

36:17.303 --> 36:19.604
and they found the real owner
of the Sunfire account

36:19.638 --> 36:21.225
that Derek used
to withdraw the money.

36:21.312 --> 36:22.946
The Articles of Incorporation

36:22.980 --> 36:25.448
were signed by our very own
orchid-loving widow--

36:25.483 --> 36:27.576
Rebecca Dalton.

36:27.676 --> 36:28.876
Shut the front door.

36:34.263 --> 36:36.110
Beckett,
you sure about this?

36:36.269 --> 36:37.885
Sir, it's all right here
in black and white.

36:37.997 --> 36:39.692
We tracked the money
from the real estate scam

36:39.792 --> 36:42.344
to this offshore account
in the Cayman Islands.

36:42.373 --> 36:44.675
So Derek decides he's done
playing the Mandalay role,

36:44.709 --> 36:47.644
and because he knows too much,
the only option is to kill him.

36:47.679 --> 36:49.379
Hey. You were right.

36:49.397 --> 36:51.765
I was able to confirm
Rebecca Dalton's whereabouts.

36:51.816 --> 36:54.267
Get a warrant to search
for the murder weapon.

36:55.512 --> 36:58.464
As someone who's written just
about every ending in the book,

36:58.515 --> 37:01.484
can I just say...
Amazing?

37:01.518 --> 37:05.722
You can say that
<i>after</i> we get the confession.

37:05.756 --> 37:08.725
Ms. Dalton, we did a thorough
search of your finances.

37:08.759 --> 37:11.432
You've lost quite a lot of money
since your husband passed away.

37:11.532 --> 37:13.557
My client doesn't need
to defend her spending habits.

37:13.657 --> 37:16.063
She does if it's relevant
to my case.

37:16.163 --> 37:18.264
What does my money have to do
with Derek's death?

37:18.543 --> 37:19.911
Everything, actually.

37:19.968 --> 37:22.736
Let's see, there is a clothing
line that never took off,

37:22.771 --> 37:25.372
a, uh,
failed jewelry business.

37:25.440 --> 37:26.537
I mean, should I go on?

37:26.637 --> 37:28.433
That doesn't make me
a murderer.

37:28.576 --> 37:29.673
Well, it was
only a matter of time

37:29.773 --> 37:31.117
until all the money was gone.

37:31.217 --> 37:33.062
Derek was handsome,
he was charming.

37:33.162 --> 37:34.428
You knew
he was a decent actor.

37:35.398 --> 37:37.365
It made him the perfect guy
to present investors

37:37.400 --> 37:39.051
with an opportunity
they couldn't refuse.

37:39.151 --> 37:40.915
This is wildly speculative,

37:41.015 --> 37:42.835
and your allegations
are baseless.

37:42.935 --> 37:45.837
Derek took 25 grand
from an account

37:45.871 --> 37:48.072
that initially led us
in circles--

37:48.090 --> 37:49.674
the Sunfire account.

37:51.510 --> 37:54.245
Well, this isn't possible.
I didn't even sign this.

37:54.263 --> 37:56.381
Rebecca, I'm advising you,
don't say another word.

37:56.415 --> 37:58.550
Wait a minute.
September 29th?

37:58.584 --> 38:01.586
I wasn't even
in the country.

38:01.620 --> 38:03.221
We know.

38:03.255 --> 38:05.423
The date it was signed?

38:05.457 --> 38:07.825
Smack-dab in the middle
of Paris Fashion Week.

38:08.198 --> 38:10.332
I knew that any former model

38:10.367 --> 38:11.544
worth her salt
would've been there,

38:11.644 --> 38:13.463
and of course,
after checking flight records,

38:13.563 --> 38:15.164
you were in Paris.

38:15.198 --> 38:17.166
Yes, and while you were
drinking champagne,

38:17.200 --> 38:20.826
your lawyer was using
his access to your information

38:20.926 --> 38:22.993
to create a scam
in your name.

38:23.028 --> 38:25.329
Oh, he was also
stealing from you,

38:25.363 --> 38:27.331
funneling the money
into his offshore account.

38:27.365 --> 38:29.133
That's why
your businesses failed.

38:29.167 --> 38:32.369
He offered Derek a job
behind your back

38:32.404 --> 38:33.904
to play Jesse Mandalay.

38:33.939 --> 38:35.406
The money was decent,

38:35.440 --> 38:37.618
but when the bikers came after
Derek, he needed more.

38:37.842 --> 38:40.074
Oh, my God.
Michael, what did you do?

38:40.130 --> 38:42.932
When you found out that Derek
made an unauthorized withdrawal,

38:42.967 --> 38:44.434
you confronted him,

38:44.468 --> 38:46.319
but he knew that
you couldn't go to the cops,

38:46.598 --> 38:49.066
so he told you
that he wanted out.

38:49.100 --> 38:51.068
You couldn't afford him
exposing your fraud,

38:51.102 --> 38:53.170
so you followed him
from his apartment,

38:53.204 --> 38:55.372
and then killed him
that night.

39:00.747 --> 39:03.048
I'm not saying
another word.

39:03.082 --> 39:05.350
Do you want a lawyer...

39:05.385 --> 39:09.087
Or do you want to hire an actor
to play one for you?

39:10.890 --> 39:13.158
So what happened with
your struggling actor case?

39:13.176 --> 39:15.160
Well, they found
the murder weapon

39:15.178 --> 39:15.929
at the lawyer's office.

39:16.032 --> 39:18.274
He confessed in an effort
to cut a deal.

39:18.374 --> 39:20.055
Oh, God. It's so sad.

39:20.155 --> 39:21.775
The poor kid was just
trying to catch a break,

39:21.875 --> 39:24.377
and he kept stepping
in the dog poo.

39:24.411 --> 39:27.046
You should stitch that on to a pillow.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.539
Oh! Hey, sweetie.

39:29.639 --> 39:31.796
Do we have a Sandra Dee
in our midst?

39:31.891 --> 39:34.259
I didn't get the part.

39:34.310 --> 39:35.877
Oh.

39:35.895 --> 39:39.347
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

39:39.382 --> 39:40.899
oh, honey.

39:44.770 --> 39:48.356
This is... the best thing
that has ever happened to you.

39:48.391 --> 39:51.392
Wh-- rejection is the bedrock
of a great acting career.

39:51.410 --> 39:55.197
Until an actor has suffered,
he hasn't really lived.

39:55.231 --> 39:56.731
Thanks, gram.

39:56.766 --> 39:58.233
You're welcome.

39:58.267 --> 40:00.702
And besides,
auditions are like men.

40:00.736 --> 40:02.704
There's another one
right around the corner.

40:02.738 --> 40:04.289
Yeah.

40:06.209 --> 40:07.414
Where are you going?

40:07.838 --> 40:10.540
Oh, we need ice cream
to ease the pain, stat.

40:10.558 --> 40:12.509
I'm going to the corner store.

40:12.543 --> 40:14.010
I am sorry, sweetie.

40:14.044 --> 40:15.897
Can I admit something?

40:15.997 --> 40:17.198
Always.

40:17.756 --> 40:18.623
Going up against Kelly

40:18.724 --> 40:21.125
made me realize, I didn't
really want the part.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.361
I could see how hungry she was,

40:22.363 --> 40:23.664
and I didn't want
to disappoint gram,

40:23.685 --> 40:25.220
but I don't love it
the way she does.

40:25.260 --> 40:28.696
Well, maybe it's not "in your
bones," as gram would say.

40:31.019 --> 40:33.354
I am proud of you for trying.

40:33.388 --> 40:35.606
Thanks, dad.
And there's a silver lining.

40:35.657 --> 40:36.624
After the announcement,

40:36.631 --> 40:38.041
the drama teacher offered me
stage manager.

40:38.133 --> 40:39.361
It's way more my style,

40:39.511 --> 40:41.075
and I get to keep
all my after-school clubs.

40:42.013 --> 40:43.480
My little overachiever.

40:44.505 --> 40:46.506
Well, congratulations
on not getting the part.

40:46.540 --> 40:49.292
♪ yes we will, yes we will ♪

40:49.343 --> 40:50.793
mmm. What smells good?

40:50.844 --> 40:53.296
Come help me. Wash up...
