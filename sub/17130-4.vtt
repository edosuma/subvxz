WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.737
YOUR DAD AND I WENT
TO THAT PLACE WHERE

00:03.737 --> 00:06.340
YOU PAINT YOUR OWN CERAMICS,
AND WE MADE THIS POT.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.277
ALL RIGHT, HOW DID YOU
SCREW UP THIS TIME?

00:09.277 --> 00:11.345
I DIDN'T. YOUR MOTHER AND I
JUST WANTED

00:11.345 --> 00:14.648
TO SPEND FOUR HOURS
OF QUALITY TIME TOGETHER.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.016
IT WAS ONE HOUR.

00:16.016 --> 00:19.387
NO WAY! YOU DON'T GET A HEADACHE
LIKE THIS IN ONE HOUR.

00:21.422 --> 00:24.625
WHY ARE YOU MAKING
A SANDWICH OUT HERE?

00:24.625 --> 00:28.262
BECAUSE GRANDMA BENNY STUNK UP
THE WHOLE DOWNSTAIRS.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.664
WELL, THAT'S GRANDMA'S
SPECIAL PERFUME.

00:30.664 --> 00:34.302
IT'S A SECRET BLEND
OF WHISKEY, TOBACCO,

00:34.302 --> 00:36.370
SWEAT AND A DEAD TOOTH.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.541
IT'S CALLED... (gags)

00:42.210 --> 00:44.778
NO, SHE'S COLORING
HER HAIR IN THE SINK,

00:44.778 --> 00:46.414
AND THE DYE REEKS.

00:49.183 --> 00:52.253
OHH! I CAN'T EVEN
BREATHE IN HERE.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.887
OH, MAN, MOM!

00:53.887 --> 00:57.391
THAT'S THE PRICE OF BEAUTY.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.461
WELL, WHATEVER YOU SPENT,
IT COSTS MORE.

01:00.461 --> 01:04.732
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS HERE?
WHY CAN'T YOU GO TO YOUR SALON?

01:04.732 --> 01:08.336
I GOT NO WAY TO GET THERE.
MY CAR BURNED UP.

01:08.336 --> 01:10.838
MAYBE IF SOMEONE
WHO OWES ME THEIR LIFE

01:10.838 --> 01:14.007
COULD LOAN ME SOME MONEY,
I COULD BUY A USED CAR.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.876
YOU'RE LIVING HERE RENT-FREE,
OKAY?

01:15.876 --> 01:18.379
YOU SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
SAVED UP BY NOW

01:18.379 --> 01:20.013
TO GET YOUR OWN CAR.

01:20.013 --> 01:21.815
I HAD A BUNCH OF MONEY
SAVED UP.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.452
BUT THEN I HAD
SOME UNFORESEEN EXPENSES.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.954
ARE YOU GAMBLING AGAIN?

01:26.954 --> 01:28.789
NO!
MOM!

01:28.789 --> 01:33.427
IT'S NOT GAMBLING
WHEN IT'S A SURE THING.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.763
THAT STUPID HORSE
BROKE ITS LEG.

01:35.763 --> 01:39.032
THE JOCKEY FELL OFF
AND GOT PARALYZED.

01:39.032 --> 01:43.437
IT'S ALWAYS ME.
SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS TO ME!

01:43.437 --> 01:45.673
GEORGE, CAN YOU HELP ME
IN HERE FOR A MINUTE?

01:45.673 --> 01:49.343
I'M DONE FOR THE DAY.
I PAINTED YOUR DAMN POT.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.779
I LISTENED TO
YOUR "SOUNDS OF THE OCEAN" CD

01:51.779 --> 01:53.347
IN THE CAR.

01:53.347 --> 01:56.049
ANGIE, WHALES SHOULD
NOT MAKE ALBUMS.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.685
I CAN JUST SEE 'EM

01:57.685 --> 01:59.887
IN THE RECORDING STUDIO
LIKE THAT...

01:59.887 --> 02:03.191
(imitating whales calling)

02:03.191 --> 02:06.026
JUST COME HERE.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.961
WHAT?

02:07.961 --> 02:10.698
LOOK, WHEN I SAID WE SHOULD
WE SHOULD TAKE YOUR MOM IN,

02:10.698 --> 02:12.900
I DID NOT KNOW
SHE'D BE HERE ALL THE TIME.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.869
SHE'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.
WE SHOULD HELP HER GET A CAR.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.471
NO. STAY STRONG, ANGIE.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.440
EVENTUALLY SHE'LL GIVE UP
AND BUY HER OWN CAR.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.042
BUT, GEORGE LOPEZ,
I AM TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW,

02:22.042 --> 02:24.545
IF I DO NOT GET SOME
ALONE TIME IN MY OWN HOUSE,

02:24.545 --> 02:26.447
YOUR MOM AND I
WILL COME TO BLOWS.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.782
Ã³RALE, "FISTS OF FURY."

02:32.753 --> 02:36.190
I'M SEEN MY MOM WRESTLE
TWO COPS TO THE GROUND

02:36.190 --> 02:38.326
WITH A TASER DART
IN HER NECK.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.829
AND YOU CRY
WHEN YOUR SHOES PINCH.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.297
GOOD LUCK, BAMBI.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.635
SO, GEORGE, IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LOAN ME ANY MONEY,

02:47.635 --> 02:50.271
COULD YOU AT LEAST LET ME
BORROW YOUR CAR TONIGHT?

02:50.271 --> 02:52.473
SORRY. I'M GOING TO THE FIGHT
DOWNTOWN WITH ERNIE,

02:52.473 --> 02:54.208
AND I WON'T BE HOME
TILL LATE.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.743
FINE.

02:55.743 --> 02:58.279
I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE
TO HANG AROUND THE HOUSE.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.680
YEAH, UPSIDE DOWN.

03:12.493 --> 03:15.296
NO, WE ARE PEOPLE, DAMN IT.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.597
OUTSIDE. OUTSIDE!

03:16.597 --> 03:18.599
ANGIE, ANGIE, ANGIE,
I'M SO SORRY.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.868
YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN
CAGED UP IN HERE SO LONG,

03:20.868 --> 03:23.003
I FORGOT MY MANNERS.

03:23.003 --> 03:25.138
SAY, NOW HERE'S AN IDEA--

03:25.138 --> 03:26.640
MAYBE YOU WILL LET ME

03:26.640 --> 03:29.777
BORROW YOUR VAN
SO I COULD GET OUT TONIGHT.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.749
NO.

03:35.749 --> 03:36.717
WHY NOT?

03:44.191 --> 03:46.794
BECAUSE...

03:46.794 --> 03:50.298
YOU WILL SUCK YOUR THUMB
AND MILK A COW.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.403
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

03:55.403 --> 03:57.771
SHE'S GONNA
DRINK AND DRIVE!

03:57.771 --> 04:01.542
I GOT THAT,
AND MY BACK WAS TO HIM.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.314
HEY THERE...

04:06.314 --> 04:08.882
GIRLFRIEND.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.322
YOU WANT TO HELP GRANDMA OUT
AND GIVE HER A RIDE TONIGHT?

04:14.322 --> 04:16.724
GRANDMA, I'M NOT DRIVING YOU
TO A BUNCH OF BARS.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.727
YOU KNOW WHAT? I JUST WANTED
TO GO TO THE PHARMACY

04:19.727 --> 04:22.630
TO PICK UP MY MEDICATION,
BUT FORGET IT.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.799
I'M SORRY. I--
OF COURSE I'LL TAKE YOU.

04:25.799 --> 04:26.767
WHICH PHARMACY?

04:26.767 --> 04:30.738
ANY ONE THAT HAS
A HAPPY HOUR.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.812
(Ernie)
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.749
WE GOTTA GO THERE AGAIN.
THAT'LL BE TWO BEERS.

04:41.749 --> 04:45.218
MAN, GEORGE,
I GOTTA THANK YOU, ALL RIGHT?

04:45.218 --> 04:48.789
THAT FIGHT WAS GREAT,
AND THOSE SEATS WERE AMAZING.

04:48.789 --> 04:52.192
HEY, I THINK I GOT BLOOD
FROM ONE OF THE BOXERS ON ME.

04:52.192 --> 04:56.029
THEY SAY WOMEN CAN'T FIGHT,
BUT DAMN, THAT ONE COULD.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.931
WHOO!

05:00.300 --> 05:03.637
YEAH, NOT TOO MUCH
TALENT HERE TONIGHT.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.672
OH!

05:07.375 --> 05:09.977
OH, I SPOKE TOO SOON.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.812
CHECK OUT THAT HOTTIE.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.882
CARMEN?

05:14.882 --> 05:16.850
YOU CAN CALL HER
WHATEVER YOU LIKE,

05:16.850 --> 05:20.053
BUT THAT'S 200 POUNDS
OF BEAUTIFUL!

05:20.053 --> 05:21.489
THE ONE PLAYING POOL.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.559
OH, HEY, THAT'S CARMEN!

05:25.559 --> 05:28.662
THAT'S COOL.
SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN CARD.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.664
WHAT DOES
A MORTGAGE BROKER DO?

05:30.664 --> 05:34.535
HE GOES TO PRISON FOR PICKING UP
17-YEAR-OLD GIRLS.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.071
DAD, GRANDMA BENNY CALLED.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.240
SHE'S DRUNK,
AND SHE NEEDED A RIDE HOME.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.975
DAMN IT, MOM!

05:41.975 --> 05:44.344
(All laughing)

05:44.344 --> 05:45.846
HEY!

05:47.280 --> 05:49.483
YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN WHAT
MY DAUGHTER'S DOING HERE?

05:49.483 --> 05:51.952
GEORGE, THANK GOD
YOU FOUND CARMEN.

05:51.952 --> 05:55.322
I FOLLOWED HER HERE,
BUT SHE GAVE ME THE SLIP.

05:55.322 --> 06:00.394
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'VE GONE
TOO FAR THIS TIME, YOU OLD BAT.

06:00.394 --> 06:03.063
YOU CAN STAND THERE
AND YELL AT ME,

06:03.063 --> 06:06.967
OR YOU CAN GET YOUR DAUGHTER
OUT OF THIS HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT.

06:06.967 --> 06:10.303
GEORGE, THERE ARE A LOT OF DRUNK
PEOPLE HERE. RIGHT, LADIES?

06:10.303 --> 06:13.006
RIGHT!
YEAH!

06:13.006 --> 06:15.375
TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.946
GINA, I'M YOUR BOSS.

06:18.946 --> 06:23.417
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
GEORGE LOPEZ IS.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.052
NUDIE UP!

06:26.386 --> 06:29.523
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

06:32.526 --> 06:35.596
* ALL MY FRIENDS

06:35.596 --> 06:37.130
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

06:49.242 --> 06:50.410
(door opens)

06:51.512 --> 06:53.747
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

06:53.747 --> 06:56.617
IT'S AFTER MIDNIGHT. YOU DO NOT
SNEAK OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.486
I KNOW,
BUT GRANDMA BENNY CALLED

06:58.486 --> 07:00.588
AND SAID SHE HAD
NO WAY TO GET HOME.

07:00.588 --> 07:03.691
AND THEN I THOUGHT,
"WHAT WOULD MOM DO?"

07:05.659 --> 07:07.928
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS
DO THE RIGHT THING.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.632
AND IF I COULD BE MORE LIKE YOU,
THEN I WOULD BE A BETTER PERSON.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.769
WHY DON'T I GET A SHOVEL
FROM THE YARD

07:15.769 --> 07:18.639
SO I CAN FERTILIZE IT
WITH ALL THIS CRAP?

07:18.639 --> 07:21.709
(sniffles)
YEAH, I DIDN'T BUY IT EITHER.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.952
GO TO BED, CARMEN.

07:40.260 --> 07:43.931
THIS IS THE MOST IRRESPONSIBLE
THING YOU HAVE EVER DONE.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.700
HOW COULD YOU TAKE OUR
17-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER TO A BAR?!

07:46.700 --> 07:49.703
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF CARMEN.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.805
I FEEL SO GUILTY. OH!

07:51.805 --> 07:55.709
I DON'T DESERVE TO BE
CONSCIOUS RIGHT NOW.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.150
MOM?

08:05.686 --> 08:09.356
OKAY, HEAR ME OUT. WE HAVE
EIGHT HOURS TILL SHE COMES TO.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.659
WE CAN GET HER
DEEP INTO MEXICO.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.462
WE'LL PUT HER
IN A PIKACHU COSTUME.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.765
WE'LL LEAVE HER
WITH A STICK AND A NOTE

08:17.765 --> 08:20.868
THAT SAYS, "BEAT ME,
I HAVE CANDY INSIDE"!

08:20.868 --> 08:23.403
HONEY, SHE'S MAKING
US ALL MISERABLE.

08:23.403 --> 08:26.840
WOULD IT BE THE END OF THE WORLD
IF WE HELPED HER BUY A CAR?

08:26.840 --> 08:29.877
IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE
TO HAVE AIR BAGS OR BRAKES.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.880
THEN SHE GETS WHAT SHE WANTS.
SHE WINS.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.416
IT'S NOT ABOUT WINNING
OR LOSING.

08:36.416 --> 08:39.587
IT'S ABOUT BEING AN ADULT
AND COMPROMISING.

08:40.754 --> 08:45.192
YOU ARE SO UNATTRACTIVE
TO ME RIGHT NOW.

08:45.192 --> 08:48.829
OKAY. IF WE DON'T
BUY HER A CAR,

08:48.829 --> 08:51.164
THEN WE ARE BOTH GOING
TO HAVE TO SUCK IT UP

08:51.164 --> 08:52.833
AND DRIVE HER AROUND.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.068
I'M WILLING TO DO MY SHARE.

08:55.068 --> 08:59.239
ALL RIGHT. I GUESS IF YOU'RE
WILLING TO TAKE THAT ON,

08:59.239 --> 09:01.408
I GUESS I CAN, TOO.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.310
THANK YOU.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.814
YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE
ACT LIKE ADULTS AND COMPROMISE?

09:06.814 --> 09:08.849
WE COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.350
YOU'RE RIGHT, BABY.

09:10.350 --> 09:13.721
OH, BY THE WAY, I GOTTA
WORK LATE FOR THE NEXT MONTH,

09:13.721 --> 09:15.856
SO HAVE FUN DRIVING
MY MOM AROUND.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.532
HOW WAS THIRSTY'S?

09:25.532 --> 09:27.067
I SCORED. BE COOL.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.535
YOU WHAT?

09:28.535 --> 09:31.004
HELLO.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.007
NAME'S SONNY, LIKE THE SUN--

09:34.007 --> 09:38.912
'CAUSE I'M HOT, AND EVERYTHING
REVOLVES AROUND ME.

09:40.213 --> 09:44.017
SO, SONNY, ARE YOU A DIPLOMAT
OR A PROFESSOR?

09:44.017 --> 09:46.286
JUST DRIVE US
TO MAGNOLIA AND WOODMAN.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.988
WE'RE GOING TO HIS PLACE.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.991
ARE WE?
HAVE WE THOUGHT THROUGH

09:50.991 --> 09:54.527
ALL THE CONSEQUENCES
OF OUR ACTIONS?

09:54.527 --> 09:58.331
I ASKED FOR A RIDE,
NOT A BUZZ KILL.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.434
FINE.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.905
SO, UH, HOW'D SHE ROPE YOU
INTO DRIVING, ANYWAY?

10:04.905 --> 10:06.907
I'M BENNY'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW.

10:06.907 --> 10:10.110
OKAY, I'LL BITE.
WHO'S BENNY?

10:11.879 --> 10:13.513
ACTUALLY,
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,

10:13.513 --> 10:16.784
BUT BENNY IS
MY MIDDLE NAME.

10:16.784 --> 10:20.287
OH, SO CRYSTAL
IS YOUR FIRST NAME.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.691
YES, IT IS.

10:23.691 --> 10:27.127
CRYSTAL BENNY CARRINGTON.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.729
(scoffs)

10:28.729 --> 10:30.197
SO TELL ME,

10:30.197 --> 10:32.232
WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT THIS LADY HERE?

10:32.232 --> 10:34.702
WELL, SONNY,

10:34.702 --> 10:38.438
CRYSTAL NEEDS SOMEONE
WHO'S HONEST,

10:38.438 --> 10:40.173
WHO DOESN'T RUSH THINGS,

10:40.173 --> 10:44.444
SOMEONE WHO EXPRESSES
HIS AFFECTION FOR HER

10:44.444 --> 10:46.680
IN A GENTLEMANLY WAY.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.182
YOU THINK YOU CAN
HANDLE THAT, SONNY?

10:49.182 --> 10:50.383
SONNY?

10:52.652 --> 10:55.655
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

10:55.655 --> 10:59.159
OH, SORRY.
I'M BEING A LITTLE RUDE HERE.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.427
THANK YOU.

11:00.427 --> 11:04.865
WHY DON'T YOU PULL OVER
AND JOIN THE PARTY?

11:04.865 --> 11:08.836
IT MAY BE CHILLY UP FRONT,
BUT BACK HERE,

11:08.836 --> 11:12.139
IT'S SONNY AND HOT.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.107
THAT'S IT.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.642
I'M DROPPING YOU OFF
AT THE FILTHIEST,

11:15.642 --> 11:17.610
MOST DISGUSTING MOTEL
I CAN FIND.

11:17.610 --> 11:22.850
OH, THE SAFARI ON SEPULVEDA
IS PRETTY NASTY...

11:22.850 --> 11:24.451
I-I HEAR.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.325
WHERE IS THE CHECKBOOK?

11:32.325 --> 11:34.527
I LEFT IT
BY THE COMPUTER. WHY?

11:34.527 --> 11:36.797
WE'RE BUYING YOUR MOM A CAR.
NO!

11:36.797 --> 11:39.299
SHE, UH, PICKED UP A GUY
AT THIRSTY'S

11:39.299 --> 11:42.469
AND THEY WERE MAKING OUT
IN THE BACKSEAT OF THE MINIVAN

11:42.469 --> 11:46.373
AND THEN THEY ASKED ME
IF I WANTED TO JOIN THEM!

11:46.373 --> 11:47.975
MOM!

11:47.975 --> 11:50.477
NOT ME. HE DID.

11:50.477 --> 11:53.981
IF I SWUNG THAT WAY,
I COULD DO BETTER THAN HER.

11:57.350 --> 12:00.420
THIS SHOULD BE ENOUGH.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.889
NO.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.891
DON'T CAVE IN.
WE'RE NOT GIVING HER A CENT.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.625
YEAH? DO YOU HAVE
ANOTHER IDEA?

12:15.803 --> 12:17.971

14:25.265 --> 14:27.334
Â¿E-soda?

14:27.334 --> 14:31.038
Why you no say "e-soda,"
stupid?

14:31.038 --> 14:34.574
ALL RIGHT, JUST GIVE ME
NINE E-SODAS.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.176
I DON'T EVEN CARE
WHAT THEY ARE.

14:36.176 --> 14:39.212
SORPRESA ME!

14:39.212 --> 14:41.114
HOLD IT.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.750
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
A BURGER.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.086
I'M THE MOOD
FOR A LITTLE MEXICAN.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.289
WHAT TIME DO YOU GET OFF?

14:51.824 --> 14:56.930
GINA, THERE ARE SOME JOBS
EVEN MEXICANS WON'T DO.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.171
(All talking over each other)

15:04.171 --> 15:06.773
(Gina)
GIVE ME SOME KETCHUP.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.618
SHUT UP AND DRIVE THE BUS!

15:18.618 --> 15:22.589
SHUT UP AND DRIVE THE BUS!
SHUT UP AND DRIVE THE BUS!

15:22.589 --> 15:25.225
SHUT UP--
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.294
WHAT'S THE BUILDING
WE'RE DRIVING BY?

15:27.294 --> 15:28.962
THAT'S THE LIBRARY.

15:28.962 --> 15:33.466
NO, I THINK
IT'S THE GAS COMPANY.

15:33.466 --> 15:34.834
(coughs)

15:34.834 --> 15:36.403
OHH!

15:38.105 --> 15:40.240
DAMN IT, GINA!

15:40.240 --> 15:42.209
OKAY, MY EYES ARE BURNING.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.877
NOBODY LIGHT A CIGARETTE.

15:44.877 --> 15:49.316
(engine revving)

15:49.316 --> 15:53.386
GEORGE, THAT KID'S
GIVING YOU THE EYE.

15:55.188 --> 15:58.325
DON'T START.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.193
GEORGE,
HE'S EGGING YOU ON!

16:00.193 --> 16:03.363
(engine continues revving)

16:03.363 --> 16:05.898
I'M NOT GETTING
SUCKED INTO THIS.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.600
GEORGE, COME ON!

16:07.600 --> 16:09.902
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR,
YOU PRISS!

16:09.902 --> 16:13.473
JUST KICK OFF YOUR HIGH HEELS
AND FLOOR IT! TAKE HIM!

16:13.473 --> 16:17.277
(All) TAKE HIM! TAKE HIM!
TAKE HIM! TAKE HIM!

16:17.277 --> 16:19.779
COME ON, GEORGE!
SHUT UP!

16:19.779 --> 16:22.282
GOD!

16:22.282 --> 16:25.952
YOU WANT SOME, PUNK?

16:25.952 --> 16:28.388
YEAH, I'LL RACE YOU, FOOL,

16:28.388 --> 16:32.325
BUT THE LOSER TAKES
YOUR WOMEN HOME. WHOO-OOH!

16:32.325 --> 16:36.596
Ã³RALE,
EMINEM, YOU'RE ON!

16:40.267 --> 16:42.735
HA! THAT'S RIGHT,
I GOT YOU!

16:42.735 --> 16:45.172
I OWN YOU, PUNK! HA HA!

16:45.172 --> 16:48.541
(siren wailing)

16:48.541 --> 16:49.809
OH, MAN.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.644
AH, DON'T WORRY, GEORGE.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.246
DON'T WORRY.

16:53.246 --> 16:56.316
I KNOW HOW
TO GET OUT OF THIS.

16:56.316 --> 16:59.686
I'LL TAKE THE TICKET!

16:59.686 --> 17:01.654
COME ON, HURRY!

17:07.560 --> 17:08.728
GEORGE...

17:08.728 --> 17:09.796
IT'S OKAY.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.030
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:11.030 --> 17:13.700
MR. LOPEZ WAS SPEEDING.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.268
HE COMMITTED
RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT,

17:15.268 --> 17:16.836
HAD OPEN CONTAINERS
IN THE CAR,

17:16.836 --> 17:21.241
TOO MANY PASSENGERS,
NONE OF THEM WEARING SEAT BELTS

17:21.241 --> 17:25.078
AND SOMEONE REACHED
FOR MY GUN.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.250
THAT WAS MY FRIEND GINA,

17:30.250 --> 17:33.320
AND SHE WASN'T REACHING
FOR YOUR GUN.

17:38.158 --> 17:41.027
THANKS, OFFICER.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.496
HONEY, WHAT IS GOING ON?

17:43.496 --> 17:45.098
SHE TRICKED ME
INTO RACING A GUY,

17:45.098 --> 17:47.367
AND I LOST MY LICENSE
FOR 30 DAYS.

17:47.367 --> 17:51.538
YOU KNOW, I FEEL
PRETTY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.072
I WILL DRIVE GEORGE AROUND.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.041
YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING
MY CAR.

17:55.041 --> 17:58.077
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU WOULD KEEP YOUR CAR

17:58.077 --> 17:59.746
IN A GARAGE
FOR A WHOLE MONTH

17:59.746 --> 18:01.748
INSTEAD OF LETTING ME
DRIVE IT?!

18:01.748 --> 18:03.116
THAT'S RIGHT,

18:03.116 --> 18:05.084
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST TO MAKE SURE...

18:09.422 --> 18:11.458
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
IN 30 DAYS

18:11.458 --> 18:13.593
WHEN YOU CAN DRIVE AGAIN?

18:15.995 --> 18:19.098
I WIN BATTLES, NOT WARS!

18:21.301 --> 18:23.670
GEORGE,
YOU ARE ACTING CRAZY.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.205
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
LET HER DRIVE YOUR CAR?

18:25.205 --> 18:27.840
WHY SHOULD I?
SHE NEVER LET ME DRIVE HERS.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.810
WHAT? THAT'S WHAT
ALL THIS IS ABOUT?

18:30.810 --> 18:32.512
YEAH, THAT'S ALL THIS
IS ABOUT.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.013
I HAD MY LICENSE
AND EVERYTHING,

18:34.013 --> 18:35.982
AND YOU NEVER LET ME
TOUCH YOUR CAR, NOT ONCE.

18:35.982 --> 18:39.152
I WAS THE ONLY ONE OF MY FRIENDS
WHO NEVER GOT TO DRIVE.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.620
YOU BIG BABY.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.623
THAT WAS 20 YEARS AGO,
AND I WAS WORKING TWO JOBS.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.993
IF YOU HAD WRECKED THAT CAR,
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN SCREWED!

18:46.993 --> 18:48.328
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT PROM NIGHT?

18:48.328 --> 18:50.330
THE HOTEL WAS BY THE AIRPORT.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.765
I HAD TO TAKE
THE SHUTTLE THERE.

18:54.401 --> 18:55.902
IF I HAD LET YOU DRIVE,

18:55.902 --> 18:58.171
YOU COULD HAVE ENDED UP
LIKE JIMMY ORTEGA.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.839
WHO?

18:59.839 --> 19:02.475
JIMMY ORTEGA. HE LIVED
DOWN THE STREET FROM US.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.477
HE WAS A COUPLE OF YEARS
OLDER THAN YOU.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.214
HE DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT.
HE WAS REAL SMART.

19:07.214 --> 19:11.718
I COULDN'T LET
MY DYSLEXIC KID DRIVE!

19:11.718 --> 19:14.787
YOU FLUNKED GYM!

19:16.055 --> 19:18.691
WHY DOES IT MATTER
WHICH WAY I RAN THE LAPS?

19:18.691 --> 19:20.026
I RAN 'EM.

19:20.026 --> 19:25.398
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET A CALL
SAYING THAT MY SON HAD DIED

19:25.398 --> 19:29.101
DRIVING THE WRONG WAY
ON A FREEWAY.

19:29.101 --> 19:32.472
SO YOU WERE WORRIED
ABOUT ME?

19:32.472 --> 19:35.041
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

19:35.041 --> 19:38.144
I GOT GRANDKIDS NOW
IF I NEED BONE MARROW.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.480
I'M NOT SO INTO YOU ANYMORE.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.082
MOM.
WHAT?

19:43.082 --> 19:44.917
WAIT.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.655
HERE.

19:48.655 --> 19:52.359
IT'S THE SPARE KEY
TO MY CAR.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.328
ABOUT TIME.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.730
HEY, BUT YOU HAVE TO
PROMISE ME

19:57.730 --> 20:00.967
THAT YOU'LL NEVER,
EVER DRINK AND DRIVE.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.614
I CAN'T BELIEVE ALL THIS TIME,
YOU WOULDN'T LET ME DRIVE

20:14.614 --> 20:16.983
'CAUSE YOU WERE AFRAID
I'D GET HURT.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.786
JUST DROP IT!

20:19.786 --> 20:22.322
IS THAT WHY YOU WOULDN'T
LET ME PLAY FOOTBALL?

20:22.322 --> 20:29.228
LOOK, GEORGE, FOR A HELMET
TO FIT YOUR HEAD...

20:34.734 --> 20:38.838
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD
TO TAKE OUT THE PADDING.

20:38.838 --> 20:43.175
NOW, I WAS ALREADY GROWING
TOMATOES IN THE BACKYARD.

20:43.175 --> 20:49.282
I DID NOT WANT ANOTHER VEGETABLE
IN THE HOUSE, OKAY?

20:49.282 --> 20:53.886
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THANKS, MOM.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.824
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEE THIS.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.126
YOU TWO ARE ACTUALLY
COMMUNICATING.

21:00.126 --> 21:04.464
YOU KNOW, THIS MIGHT BE
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

21:04.464 --> 21:07.467
TO CLEAR THE AIR ABOUT
OTHER ISSUES YOU GUYS HAVE.

21:12.138 --> 21:14.474
FAIR ENOUGH.

21:14.474 --> 21:17.444
YOUR WIFE IS A TOOL.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.114
IS THAT ENOUGH FOR NOW
OR DO YOU WANT MORE?
