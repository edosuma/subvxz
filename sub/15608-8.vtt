00:07.928 --> 00:09.760
Yes! I scored a goal!

00:09.760 --> 00:11.512
Yeah, for the other team!

00:13.013 --> 00:14.805
Ba-boosh! We win!

00:14.805 --> 00:18.139
Remind me, Emma, how many
competitions have we beat
the boys in this week?

00:18.139 --> 00:22.063
Let's see. There
was canoe racing,
archery, tetherball.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.904
Okay, okay, you don't
have to rub it in.

00:23.904 --> 00:26.067
Seriously, how low
can you go?

00:26.067 --> 00:28.239
Very low.
That's why we beat
you at limbo, too.

00:28.239 --> 00:29.410
Okay, up top.

00:30.201 --> 00:31.412
We kicked your butts!

00:31.412 --> 00:32.783

what they say,

00:35.286 --> 00:36.367
Knock.

00:38.419 --> 00:40.541
Didn't think that
through, did ya?
There wasn't time.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.712
I tried my best.

00:43.374 --> 00:45.126
Okay, we want a rematch.

00:45.126 --> 00:46.467
No, we do not.

00:46.467 --> 00:48.299
Come on Ravi, we can't
keep losing to the girls!

00:48.299 --> 00:49.880
Trust me,
you get used to it.

00:51.132 --> 00:53.304
Fine. Let me
stretch my wrists.

00:56.597 --> 00:58.309
Are you guys done?

00:59.270 --> 01:00.641
And why is Ravi Vogue -ing?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.314
Actually, we're still playing.

01:03.314 --> 01:05.065
But you guys have The Spot.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.397
We want to hang out here!

01:06.397 --> 01:07.688
Oh, drat,

01:07.688 --> 01:09.950
I was so looking forward
to foosing the ball.

01:11.532 --> 01:12.783
That's Ravi-speak for

01:12.783 --> 01:14.455
"I'm tired of getting
whooped by the women."

01:17.698 --> 01:19.830
I thought they'd never leave.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.912
They're so annoying.

01:21.912 --> 01:24.004
Hey, you wanna hear
my new scream?

01:24.004 --> 01:25.296
(SCREAMS)

01:26.547 --> 01:27.968

01:27.968 --> 01:30.711

ditch him, he finds us.

01:30.711 --> 01:32.092
All right, dweebs.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.384

01:49.069 --> 01:50.991
And, they're gone.

01:50.991 --> 01:54.195

my imaginary igloo.

03:00.891 --> 03:02.182
It's air-conditioned.

03:03.514 --> 03:05.226
Seriously, who invited him?

03:06.937 --> 03:08.359
Guys, look!

03:08.359 --> 03:11.402
That little house blew
right into that tree!

03:11.402 --> 03:13.234
Okay, I'm from New York City,

03:13.234 --> 03:15.025
and even I know
that's a treehouse.

03:15.656 --> 03:16.907
Oh!

03:16.907 --> 03:18.869
My mom never lets
me play outside.

03:19.450 --> 03:20.781
Or play.

03:22.583 --> 03:24.585
Maybe we can fix it up

03:24.585 --> 03:26.707
and make this
our chill zone!

03:26.707 --> 03:29.250
That is literally
the name of my igloo.

03:32.463 --> 03:35.676
Okay, so, whichever
team stacks their wood
the fastest, wins.

03:35.676 --> 03:37.258
And the losers, you,

03:37.258 --> 03:40.140
have to take out the trash
of the winners, us!

03:40.140 --> 03:43.103
Okay, Ravi, I am not
going to lose to them again!

03:43.103 --> 03:45.476
The only thing we've
won all summer is
"best-smelling cabin".

03:45.476 --> 03:47.608
And it took many of
my scented candles

03:47.608 --> 03:51.021
to overcome what I call,
"The Jorge Effect."

03:51.021 --> 03:53.854
Well, let's win something
that doesn't involve
smelling like jasmine.

03:55.025 --> 03:57.408
On your mark, get set, stack!

04:01.622 --> 04:03.574
Wow, Emma, you are
really good at this.

04:03.574 --> 04:06.327
It's just like stacking shoe
boxes when I go shopping,

04:06.327 --> 04:07.828
but with termites.

04:07.828 --> 04:09.500
Come on, Ravi, hurry!

04:09.500 --> 04:11.582
Do you know what it's like
to be trash-talked by
your own girlfriend?

04:11.582 --> 04:13.834
No. Usually I just
get excuses

04:13.834 --> 04:16.256
about why they need
to go home early.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.759
And done.
We win! Again!

04:18.759 --> 04:20.681
Way to lose, you losers!

04:20.681 --> 04:22.433
You should open
a losing factory,

04:22.433 --> 04:24.385
but then you'd probably lose
the keys to the building,

04:24.385 --> 04:27.308
and your business would
go under, losers!

04:27.308 --> 04:29.440
Oh, boom! She got you...

04:30.230 --> 04:31.442
I think.

04:32.523 --> 04:35.275
Nice to know you girls are
such gracious winners.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.198
Oh, you're just mad
because now you have to
take out our trash.

04:38.198 --> 04:40.321
And our trash is extra trashy.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.202
Momma likes her stinky cheese.

04:42.202 --> 04:45.035
Come on, Emma, let's go
celebrate with some Limburger.

04:49.079 --> 04:50.911
Guys, once we
fix this place up,

04:50.911 --> 04:53.123
it's going to be
an awesome hangout!

04:53.123 --> 04:55.586
I wonder if we could
fit in a hot tub.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.798
Gotta get my soak on!

04:57.798 --> 05:00.421
Okay, I took out
this broken board.

05:00.421 --> 05:02.633
That wasn't broken
when you started.

05:03.764 --> 05:06.016
So, what should we do next?

05:06.016 --> 05:07.978
I don't know.
The only thing I've built

05:07.978 --> 05:10.391
is a three-dimensional
model of DNA.

05:10.391 --> 05:11.562
I won an award.

05:11.562 --> 05:12.733
Not bragging though.

05:14.234 --> 05:16.487
You can't brag to
people who don't care.

05:17.988 --> 05:20.741
So, none of us have any
building experience?

05:20.741 --> 05:23.153
Don't worry, ladies.
I know what I'm doing.

05:23.824 --> 05:24.825
(BOTH GRUNT)

05:26.657 --> 05:29.370
That's right. Just rest
your pretty little heads

05:29.370 --> 05:30.911
while I take care
of everything.

05:39.089 --> 05:43.013
Look, I am sorry we
keep losing to Emma
and Lou because of me.

05:43.013 --> 05:44.805
But if it makes you
feel any better...

05:47.678 --> 05:50.060
Is there more to
that sentence?
No.

05:50.060 --> 05:51.642
I got nothing,
I am too depressed.

05:55.606 --> 05:58.278
Wow! That was
a really tough shot.

05:58.278 --> 05:59.820
How did you make that?

05:59.820 --> 06:02.032
I just calculated the exact
angle at which the white ball

06:02.032 --> 06:04.615
would need to hit
the other ball in order for
it to go into the hole.

06:04.615 --> 06:05.746
Badda bing, badda boom.

06:07.077 --> 06:09.289
You figured all that
out on the spot?
Sure.

06:09.289 --> 06:12.583
When I am feeling sad,
I look for the math
in the situation.

06:12.583 --> 06:13.914
Geometry is my Adele.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.761
I can't believe how
good you are at pool.

06:20.761 --> 06:25.095
No offense, it's almost
like you're coordinated!

06:25.095 --> 06:27.808
You say "No offense,"
but then you say
something very offensive.

06:28.809 --> 06:30.601
Ravi, this is it!

06:30.601 --> 06:33.013
This is how we can
finally beat the girls.

06:33.013 --> 06:34.515
You are right!

06:34.515 --> 06:36.977
At last, I can
help us to victory!

06:36.977 --> 06:38.979
And we should bet them
something huge!

06:38.979 --> 06:40.611
Ooh, I like that.

06:40.611 --> 06:42.232
But we can't go to
the girls too confident,

06:42.232 --> 06:43.734
or they'll get suspicious.

06:43.734 --> 06:45.195
We've gotta hustle them.

06:45.195 --> 06:46.577
But I am a terrible dancer.

06:48.118 --> 06:50.030
Not "the Hustle".

06:50.030 --> 06:52.372
I mean, we gotta make
them think we're bad,

06:52.372 --> 06:54.244
so that we can
get 'em good.

06:54.244 --> 06:55.836
That's where you
come in, pool shark.

06:55.836 --> 06:58.749
Oh stop. I might be
a pool minnow.

06:58.749 --> 07:02.092
A pool haddock at best.
But a pool shark? Please.

07:02.092 --> 07:03.714
You're not used to getting
compliments, are you?

07:03.714 --> 07:04.885
Is it that obvious?

07:07.848 --> 07:11.431
Okay, maybe one of
these kids can help
us build our treehouse.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.263
That kid has
pretty good technique.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.187
Oh, never mind,
he's a glue-eater.

07:18.559 --> 07:19.770
Hey, guys.

07:19.770 --> 07:21.862
(SCREAMING)

07:21.862 --> 07:23.363
Before you do anything crazy,

07:23.363 --> 07:25.866
keep in mind that
there are a lot
of witnesses out here!

07:27.488 --> 07:29.740
Oh, come on!

07:29.740 --> 07:31.832
Look, I just want
to talk to you.

07:31.832 --> 07:33.914
I know we haven't
always gotten along.

07:33.914 --> 07:36.627
You once buried me up
to my neck in an anthill.

07:36.627 --> 07:39.630
So I goof a little
hard sometimes.

07:39.630 --> 07:42.342
To make it up to you,
I want to help you
fix your treehouse.

07:42.342 --> 07:44.925
Did you follow us
into the woods?

07:44.925 --> 07:47.137
Your creepy level
just went up to 10.

07:47.928 --> 07:49.389
I can help you.

07:49.389 --> 07:52.142
My dad's a contractor, so
I'm good at building things.

07:52.142 --> 07:53.644
And overcharging people.

07:54.765 --> 07:58.228
Okay, but if we
choose to do this,

07:58.228 --> 08:00.230
you cannot tell
the other Weasels.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.862
That's not a problem.

08:01.862 --> 08:03.734
They're not great
conversationalists.

08:06.406 --> 08:08.659
I don't know.
Can we trust her?

08:08.659 --> 08:10.701
We'd be building
with the enemy.

08:10.701 --> 08:12.953
But we would get
our treehouse,

08:12.953 --> 08:15.205
even if Lydia is
evil incarnate.

08:16.537 --> 08:18.879
Okay, you have
yourself a deal!

08:18.879 --> 08:20.831
Great! And by the way,

08:20.831 --> 08:23.423
I could hear everything
you just said about me.

08:23.423 --> 08:26.587
Oh, uh... We meant
another Lydia.

08:26.587 --> 08:28.799
Yeah, her!
Hey, meanie!

08:28.799 --> 08:30.681
On your way to
an evil convention?

08:32.933 --> 08:35.135
See? She is the worst.

08:41.812 --> 08:42.903
Lydia was right.

08:42.903 --> 08:45.606
These slats will work
great for the treehouse!

08:54.745 --> 08:57.457
I told Lou that cheese would
go straight to my butt!

08:59.790 --> 09:01.211
Grab that last nail.

09:10.881 --> 09:13.764
Wow, that was some
heavy pudding.

09:13.764 --> 09:16.226
Yes, usually the food
just tastes like rocks.

09:18.388 --> 09:20.270
Quick, grab the bolts!

09:20.270 --> 09:22.943
If my mom saw me doing this,
it would kill her.

09:22.943 --> 09:23.894
Take a picture.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.066
Go, go, go!

09:27.948 --> 09:28.949
(METAL CLINKS)

09:28.949 --> 09:30.861
(CREAKING)

09:30.861 --> 09:31.952
Oh, boy.

09:41.001 --> 09:43.123
Is it just me, or is
this camp really
starting to fall apart?

09:44.334 --> 09:45.666
Tell me about it.

09:45.666 --> 09:47.708
So, what do you
sad sacks want?

09:47.708 --> 09:49.920
What we want is a chance
to end our losing streak

09:49.920 --> 09:52.843
and reclaim our dignity
in a game of billiards.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.975
You seriously want
to take us on again?

09:54.975 --> 09:57.477
Because if so, we're going
to crush you like a car

09:57.477 --> 09:59.519
in a giant machine
that crushes things.

09:59.519 --> 10:00.891
I'm not sure what
that's called.

10:00.891 --> 10:03.603
I think it's called
a "crusher".
Yeah, that!

10:03.603 --> 10:05.686
I know it seems like we are
gluttons for punishment,

10:05.686 --> 10:07.988
but please, humor us.

10:07.988 --> 10:10.360
Okay, we'll even
let you break.

10:11.071 --> 10:12.152
(SIGHS)

10:13.283 --> 10:15.786
Uh, Ravi, you need
to turn it around.

10:18.538 --> 10:20.370
Really? Because
this feels wrong.

10:25.956 --> 10:26.837
Whoopsie!

10:32.382 --> 10:35.015
(GASPS) I hit the three-ball!
How many points is that?

10:35.015 --> 10:36.216
Three, I assume?

10:41.061 --> 10:43.263
Uh-uh-uh,
that nail is crooked.

10:43.263 --> 10:44.725
Sorry.

10:44.725 --> 10:47.898
You know, Lydia, you can
help out a little, too.

10:47.898 --> 10:50.190
I am helping.
I'm telling you what
you're doing wrong.

10:52.322 --> 10:54.825
Hey, Lydia, how about
something to drink?

10:54.825 --> 10:55.946
Sure.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.082
Ah. That was refreshing.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.747
Guys, I think we're done!

11:10.921 --> 11:14.054
Now this treehouse
is our tree home.

11:14.054 --> 11:16.176
Oh, that's so cute.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.259
You guys actually think
this place is yours?

11:19.259 --> 11:20.390
(WHISTLES)

11:23.433 --> 11:25.936
This is Weasel property now!

11:25.936 --> 11:29.019
Wait a minute,
you guys played us?

11:29.519 --> 11:31.231
Like a violin.

11:31.231 --> 11:35.155
How dare you besmirch
such a beautiful instrument!

11:35.155 --> 11:38.658
Wait, why didn't you
just take the treehouse
when you first saw it?

11:38.658 --> 11:41.121
Because we needed
you for manual labor.

11:41.121 --> 11:44.034
My girls were working on our
Weasel of the Month calendar.

11:44.034 --> 11:45.826
Crystal is July.

11:50.330 --> 11:53.543
Now start walking,
or start falling!

11:53.543 --> 11:56.216
We're not going anywhere!
Right, guys?

11:58.889 --> 12:00.340
Gone again!

12:00.340 --> 12:01.802
I need better friends.

12:07.107 --> 12:08.979
Oh, Hades' anklets!

12:08.979 --> 12:10.981
I really thought
we had that one.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.562
You and me both.

12:12.562 --> 12:15.906
Oh, cruel universe,
will the losing ever stop?

12:15.906 --> 12:17.027
Dial it back.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.991
Perhaps you girls
will give us a rematch?

12:20.991 --> 12:23.033
And how about we make things
a little more interesting?

12:23.033 --> 12:24.995
Keep talkin'.
We up the ante,

12:24.995 --> 12:26.326
raise the stakes,
ramp up the action...

12:26.326 --> 12:27.367
Stop talkin'.

12:28.368 --> 12:30.250
We make a bet, okay?

12:30.250 --> 12:34.214
Whichever team loses has
to cover themselves
in honey and feathers,

12:34.214 --> 12:36.136
and run around camp,
clucking like a chicken.

12:36.136 --> 12:38.048
You've got yourself a deal.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.840
Hope honey doesn't make
your skin break out,

12:39.840 --> 12:41.972
because it happens to me,

12:41.972 --> 12:43.223
and it's a real curse.

12:45.225 --> 12:47.267
Hey, Ravi, what are
you thinking?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.849
Solids or stripes?

12:48.849 --> 12:52.602
Well, Xander, I'm feeling
pretty solid about stripes.

12:58.158 --> 12:59.820
It's probably just
beginner's luck.

13:02.112 --> 13:03.113
Or not.

13:04.744 --> 13:06.997
Uh-oh.
I think we're
getting hustled.

13:06.997 --> 13:08.748
Ravi, how are you so good?

13:08.748 --> 13:11.501
Math. As my boy
Pythagoras would say,

13:11.501 --> 13:13.043
A-squared plus B-squared

13:13.043 --> 13:15.125
equals Ravi
kicks butt at pool!

13:15.125 --> 13:17.968
Ravi, sometimes saying
nothing makes you cooler.

13:24.684 --> 13:28.979
Okay, I am tired of
the Weasels always
pushing us around.

13:28.979 --> 13:30.560
We have to take a stand,

13:30.560 --> 13:32.732
so they know we're not
going to take it anymore!

13:32.732 --> 13:34.734
Great idea!
Let's tattle on them.

13:36.146 --> 13:39.779
No, only babies
tattle on people.

13:39.779 --> 13:42.282
We are going to do
the mature thing,

13:42.282 --> 13:43.533
and use a stink bomb.

13:49.159 --> 13:51.952
Now all we have to do
is sit and wait.

13:56.456 --> 13:58.418
(ALL COUGHING)

14:01.381 --> 14:02.842
Nice try.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.224
(CHUCKLES) Not!

14:04.224 --> 14:06.226
Now, if you'll excuse us,

14:06.226 --> 14:09.309
we have to get back to
our calendar photo shoot.

14:09.309 --> 14:11.061
Crystal likes
the wind-blown look.

14:19.239 --> 14:21.281
Look at her hair.

14:21.281 --> 14:22.742
I think I'm in love.

14:27.157 --> 14:30.370
This is Emma Ross, reporting.
The game is neck-and-neck.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.293
Despite being hustled,
the girls have
managed to catch up!

14:33.293 --> 14:35.625
What will happen? Let's see.

14:35.625 --> 14:39.129
Okay, Xander, simply
hit the cue ball at
a 45-degree angle.

14:39.129 --> 14:41.301
After impact, the force
of the cue ball
against the eight-ball

14:41.301 --> 14:42.712
will send it into
the side pocket,

14:42.712 --> 14:44.304
assuming that there is no
friction between the two!

14:44.304 --> 14:45.305
Gosh, I love sports!

14:47.137 --> 14:48.138
I'm just gonna hit it.

14:52.772 --> 14:54.354
Ha! You missed,

14:54.354 --> 14:56.146
because girls kick butt,
and boys...

14:56.896 --> 14:58.438
Don't.

14:58.438 --> 14:59.479
You'll get it.

15:00.690 --> 15:02.282
Uh, I would have made that,

15:02.282 --> 15:04.524
but this felt is
not regulation!

15:04.524 --> 15:07.157
(CHUCKLES) Your excuse is
even worse than your shot!

15:08.238 --> 15:10.160
And here comes Lou
the Laser Shooter.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.291
Lou, how do you feel?

15:11.291 --> 15:13.083
I feel confident.
I feel proud.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.245
And if I'm being honest,
a little bit bloated.

15:15.245 --> 15:16.336
I went hard on that cheese.

15:18.458 --> 15:21.751
All right, if this plan
doesn't get us our
treehouse back,

15:21.751 --> 15:23.253
I don't know what will.

15:23.253 --> 15:25.465
Jorge, stay on script!

15:25.465 --> 15:29.219
Can't make any promises.
I'm an improv man.

15:29.219 --> 15:30.971
Another reason
to hate improv.

15:32.312 --> 15:35.225
Come on guys, let's get
our treehouse back!

15:35.225 --> 15:37.397
(ALL FAKE LAUGHING)

15:37.397 --> 15:41.151
That was so much fun!
I love our new hangout!

15:41.151 --> 15:44.154
Tell me about it!
It's the coolest!

15:44.154 --> 15:46.656
Keep it down, clown-farts!

15:46.656 --> 15:49.199
But, what are you
talking about?

15:49.199 --> 15:52.072
Oh, nothing, just this
super awesome cave

15:52.072 --> 15:53.493
we found over
by the stream.

15:53.493 --> 15:56.246
Yeah, it's our new clubhouse!

15:56.246 --> 15:59.959
We put in a TV, a couch.
A popcorn-maker!

15:59.959 --> 16:02.252
And there are bats!

16:02.252 --> 16:04.174
That wasn't in the script!

16:04.174 --> 16:05.505
I love bats!

16:07.347 --> 16:09.719
What can I say?
I know what women want.

16:12.682 --> 16:14.434
News flash,

16:14.434 --> 16:18.188
we're taking that cave,
and there is nothing you
can do about it, twerps!

16:18.188 --> 16:19.649
But it's ours!

16:19.649 --> 16:22.152
And we would miss
our bat friends!

16:22.152 --> 16:24.194
Too bad. They're our bats now.

16:25.865 --> 16:27.407
Hey, Crystal.

16:27.407 --> 16:29.279
Did it hurt when you
fell from heaven?

16:33.323 --> 16:34.704
She totally digs me!

16:36.536 --> 16:38.458
Okay, what should
we do first?

16:38.458 --> 16:40.290
Dance party!

16:40.290 --> 16:41.461
(HUMMING)

16:47.547 --> 16:50.220
I told you Lydia would
fall for the fake cave!

16:50.220 --> 16:52.222
She's as dumb as she is mean.

16:52.222 --> 16:53.973
What did you just
say about me?

16:54.394 --> 16:56.015
Uh...

16:56.015 --> 16:58.938
We were talking
about the other Lydia.

16:58.938 --> 17:01.601
We were?
I thought we were
talking about her.

17:02.982 --> 17:05.645
I can't believe you
guys suckered us.

17:05.645 --> 17:08.488
Good thing I came back
for Crystal's fan.

17:08.488 --> 17:10.150
That would be me.

17:10.150 --> 17:11.861
You think you
could set us up?

17:11.861 --> 17:15.365
Nah, she usually likes
her boyfriends living.

17:15.365 --> 17:18.418
You wouldn't hit a kid
with glasses, would you?

17:18.418 --> 17:21.461
Absolutely. That way
you can focus on my fist.

17:23.002 --> 17:24.254
(ALL SCREAMING)

17:30.049 --> 17:31.341
I can't believe I missed!

17:31.341 --> 17:35.385
Stupid non-regulation felt.

17:35.385 --> 17:38.438
Now all Ravi has to do is get
the eight-ball in and we win!

17:38.438 --> 17:41.521
Looks like you put
the "Lou" in "lou-ser".

17:41.521 --> 17:44.774
Yeah, well, you put
the "der" in "Xan-der".

17:44.774 --> 17:48.398
And in case you haven't
noticed, Ravi has to jump our
ball to sink the eight-ball.

17:48.398 --> 17:50.069
That is an impossible shot.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.452
Not for Ravi,
the pool haddock.

17:52.452 --> 17:55.495
Okay Ravi, you can finally
win one for the boys!

17:55.495 --> 17:57.497
Are you forgetting
my scented candles?

17:58.408 --> 17:59.749
Now no pressure,

17:59.749 --> 18:01.461
but if you don't
sink this shot,

18:01.461 --> 18:04.504
we can never show our
faces around camp again.

18:04.504 --> 18:06.916
You say "No pressure,"
but then you put all
this pressure on me.

18:06.916 --> 18:08.628
Because I know
you can handle it.

18:08.628 --> 18:11.010
Right. I can handle it.

18:11.010 --> 18:12.842
No problem.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.474

18:30.360 --> 18:32.992
What are you waiting for?
We need this to win!
Just shoot!

18:32.992 --> 18:34.994
I cannot!
Why?

18:34.994 --> 18:37.367
Because winning is
so important to you,

18:37.367 --> 18:39.699
and not letting you down
again is so important to me.

18:39.699 --> 18:43.082
And it all rests on this
one shot, and my hands
are really sweaty.

18:43.082 --> 18:45.335
Will someone please
open a flipping window?

18:47.167 --> 18:48.798
Things have taken
a dramatic turn here,

18:48.798 --> 18:51.381
as Ravi Ross suffers
a total meltdown.

18:51.381 --> 18:52.382
Ravi, care to comment?

18:52.382 --> 18:54.174
Get that microphone
out of my face!

18:54.174 --> 18:55.885
Whoa! Okay. Okay, Ravi.

18:57.307 --> 18:58.598
Calm down, okay?

18:58.598 --> 19:01.020
You don't want this to
wind up in the tabloids.

19:01.020 --> 19:03.763
Look, I didn't mean to put
so much pressure on you.

19:03.763 --> 19:05.645
Don't give up because of me.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.228
But what if I try
and fail you again?

19:08.228 --> 19:10.149
Well, at least
you'll have tried.

19:10.149 --> 19:14.113
After all, you miss 100%
of the shots you don't take.

19:14.113 --> 19:17.116
Ooh, that just gave me chills.
Math always inspires me.

19:24.374 --> 19:25.585

hot and boys are not!

we beat ourselves.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.352
I know. They really suck
the joy out of everything.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.145
Who wants a hunk
of free-range Ravi?

22:37.777 --> 22:39.278
I don't know
about those girls,

22:39.278 --> 22:41.190
but there's a hawk
overhead eyeing you.

22:41.190 --> 22:42.692
(HAWK SCREECHING)

22:44.694 --> 22:46.195
(BOTH LAUGHING)

22:46.195 --> 22:47.537
And the joy is back!
