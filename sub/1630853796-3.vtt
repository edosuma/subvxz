WEBVTT

00:53.595 --> 00:54.929
Stay still.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.390
I'm hungry.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.517
Liv. Stay still.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.564
I have to go, Dad.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.056
Good, right?

02:03.289 --> 02:04.749
There.

02:07.669 --> 02:08.962
Now you look just like me.

02:11.339 --> 02:12.549
No!

02:44.581 --> 02:45.748
I won't do that.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.042
I said no.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.295
No. I won't do that.

02:52.213 --> 02:55.341
Then tell me what you would have me do.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.488
I love you.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.292
Be good.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.700
-Knock, knock. Hey.

04:02.784 --> 04:03.618
Hey.

04:03.701 --> 04:07.205
-I brought you something to eat.
-Oh, that's… No, that, you don't…

04:07.288 --> 04:08.498
Relax, it's just lunch.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.000
And since you don't seem to take it,
I thought I'd bring it to you.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.418
-Danny?
-Don't worry.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.003
I got some for me, too.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.129
Don't overthink it.

04:16.130 --> 04:19.259
We're just two responsible employees
fueling our bodies

04:19.342 --> 04:22.220
so we can be efficient and effective cogs

04:22.303 --> 04:25.556
in this giant corporate machine
that doesn't care if we live or die.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.231
And this isn't about…

04:34.524 --> 04:36.901
dispelling any weirdness
after the other night.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.531
Or trying to be friends.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.742
I don't even want to be your friend.

04:44.826 --> 04:45.994
I don't even like you.

04:46.577 --> 04:48.371
We can talk about work the whole time.

04:51.624 --> 04:52.750
Or just…

04:53.459 --> 04:55.586
…eat in silence, you know.

04:56.713 --> 04:57.880
I love silence.

04:58.881 --> 05:00.550
It's like one of my favorite things.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.053
That's, it's like silence, sleeping in…

05:05.388 --> 05:07.432
getting lunch with fellow associates.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.907
-My God.
-Right?

05:24.991 --> 05:27.785
Food. They make all different kinds.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.954
You could do this every day if you wanted.

05:31.080 --> 05:31.914
I eat.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.207
-Yeah?
-Mm-hm.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.049
-Ah.
-This is my snack drawer.

05:41.132 --> 05:44.385
That's not food. That's a…
that's a cry for help.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.678
Luckily, I'm very helpful.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.972
This is delicious. Thank you.

05:50.558 --> 05:53.269
I've never once seen you
eating one of those snacks.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.564
I do it when no one's looking.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.110
Good to know about the drawer though.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.405
You stay out of it.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.872
You'll want to avoid eating
soft cheese,

06:12.955 --> 06:15.750
fresh juice, raw fish or sushi,

06:15.833 --> 06:18.503
cookie dough, alcohol,
pre-stuffed poultry,

06:18.586 --> 06:23.007
deli meats, unwashed fruits or vegetables,
smoked seafood, shellfish.

06:23.091 --> 06:26.719
And really, you should only be
drinking filtered water from now on.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.930
Liv, are you listening?

07:48.676 --> 07:49.927
I got to boil it.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.070
Okay.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.796
Honestly, I'm concerned.

09:07.463 --> 09:09.006
She's not engaged.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.675
She's not focusing.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.719
Or if she is,
she's focused on the wrong things.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.097
-Is it affecting her work?
-No, it's not.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.140
She's clearly very bright.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.102
Then what's the problem?

09:21.185 --> 09:24.021
She's withdrawn.
She's not making friends.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.482
And she seems to have zero interest
in doing so.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.693
And she talks to herself.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.238
So? Kids talk to themselves.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.448
You're both dealing with a lot.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.994
Is there family that could stay with you,
help you out for a while?

09:38.077 --> 09:38.911
No.

09:39.620 --> 09:43.124
Her grandparents are gone.
My brothers are in Columbia.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.041
It's just us.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.710
What about her mother's family?

09:45.793 --> 09:48.421
No. We'll be fine.
We can manage on our own.

10:10.318 --> 10:13.404
Fuck, yes! Yes!

10:13.946 --> 10:15.489
-Oh! Ow!

10:16.365 --> 10:18.326
Fuck! Ah!

10:35.509 --> 10:39.639
Ah, fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck.

10:46.729 --> 10:47.563
Fuck.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.378
That money's not yours.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.216
Or the oxy that came with it.

11:17.051 --> 11:20.721
You don't think the people
that it belongs to, might want it back?

11:27.186 --> 11:29.271
You know, just because our flight
wasn't logged

11:29.355 --> 11:32.233
and you can't find your way out
of a wet paper bag,

11:32.316 --> 11:33.984
doesn't mean they can't find you.

11:35.111 --> 11:38.280
And let's just say that staying lost
might be preferable.

11:49.125 --> 11:49.959
Fine.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.962
You don't want to listen to me?

11:54.547 --> 11:55.673
Suit yourself.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.383
This cocoa is delicious. Thank you.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.931
-Mom used to make it for me.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.575
-You've been drawing a lot?

13:53.290 --> 13:56.168
How come no family ever comes to visit us?

14:00.589 --> 14:02.633
We came here to do things our own way.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.387
We're fine. We don't need anybody else.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.809
But what if you go somewhere?

14:11.892 --> 14:12.810
What if…

14:15.312 --> 14:16.313
you die?

14:24.780 --> 14:26.115
I'm not going anywhere, Liv.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.159
I'm right here.

14:31.787 --> 14:32.788
You see me?

14:33.706 --> 14:35.875
See how strong I am?

14:37.835 --> 14:39.628
I'm right here, okay?

14:52.808 --> 14:54.685
Do you think she misses us?

14:58.105 --> 15:00.774
-I don't know what she thinks.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.739
Do you think I'm like her?

15:18.459 --> 15:19.710
Why did she leave?

15:21.003 --> 15:22.755
-Was it--
-What does it matter, Liv?

15:22.838 --> 15:24.715
No more, okay?

15:24.798 --> 15:28.677
She's gone and we're here.
She left because she left.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.305
She was sick,
it had nothing to do with you, okay?

15:33.557 --> 15:35.017
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.117
Drink your cocoa. It's getting cold.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.040
Are you hungry?

16:04.713 --> 16:06.840
Come on, fishy.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.009
Come on.

16:12.888 --> 16:13.931
Damn it.

16:30.990 --> 16:31.991
Okay.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.464
Fuck you, fish.

17:22.916 --> 17:25.794
Fuck you, fish! Fuck you!

17:25.878 --> 17:27.713
Probably not supposed to eat you anyway!

17:50.694 --> 17:54.448
We got to go through every file,
every deposition, every bit of testimony,

17:54.531 --> 17:55.699
and construct a timeline,

17:55.783 --> 17:57.868
see where our stories line up
and where they collide.

17:57.951 --> 17:59.995
-That's gonna take days.
-No, it's not.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.955
We don't have days. We have today.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.832
So, that's how long it's going to take.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.711
Look, I know it's going to suck,
but it's the job.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.463
So, let's suck it up and do it right.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.174
Danny, I want you running point--

18:12.257 --> 18:14.176
Liv, can I talk to you for a second?

18:14.259 --> 18:15.636
Hey, are you almost done?
We need you in here.

18:15.719 --> 18:18.430
-Sophie took a message for you.
-Then why isn't Sophie giving it to me?

18:18.514 --> 18:21.308
-Can we just talk in the hallway?
-Ruth, I don't have time! What is it?

18:22.851 --> 18:23.894
Your dad had a fall.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.733
The home care nurse
called from the hospital.

18:29.817 --> 18:30.984
She's there with him now.

18:31.068 --> 18:34.071
She says he seems all right,
he's resting and being monitored,

18:34.154 --> 18:35.405
but she wanted you to know.

18:35.489 --> 18:36.782
She says he blacked out.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.870
It's the meds. They make him dizzy.

18:42.579 --> 18:45.040
-Guys, let's give her a second, okay?
-No.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.126
We don't have a second.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.504
She said he's stable?

18:50.587 --> 18:53.382
Yeah, they're keeping him
overnight, but you should probably--

18:53.465 --> 18:57.386
Okay, tell Sophie to call her and tell her
that I'll check in in a couple of hours.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.054
-We need to get this done.
-Liv?

18:59.138 --> 19:01.306
Ruth, what am I gonna do? Sit by his bed?

19:01.390 --> 19:02.766
That's what she's doing.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.518
Tell her I'll check in
in a couple of hours

19:04.601 --> 19:05.978
and to text me if anything changes.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.814
Now when you're done out there,
we need you in here with the rest of us.

19:10.983 --> 19:11.984
Sure.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.362
All right.
Let's start from the beginning.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.281
Okay.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.094
Where is everyone else?

19:39.678 --> 19:42.306
They're starting to fall apart.
So, I sent them on a break.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.642
How's your dad?

19:46.977 --> 19:50.355
Fine. They've got him on something.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.899
She says he's out like a light.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.654
I'm sorry I yelled at you earlier.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.408
I know that motion needs a ton of work.

20:03.076 --> 20:06.371
I think you, me or Danny should be
writing first drafts from now on.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.372
How's it coming?

20:07.456 --> 20:08.415
It's good.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.584
Is it great? It needs to be great.

20:10.667 --> 20:11.710
It's great, Liv.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.799
I really think
you should take some time off.

20:19.092 --> 20:20.302
Just be with your dad.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.804
There's nothing I can do for him.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.306
Of course, there is.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.686
He's asleep most of the time.

20:32.522 --> 20:33.941
And when he's awake…

20:35.400 --> 20:37.152
we don't have much to talk about.

20:44.701 --> 20:46.161
We're just different people.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.372
Always have been.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.334
I know that it's scary.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.755
When my brother got sick…

20:58.465 --> 21:00.592
I didn't know how to be around him either.

21:02.761 --> 21:05.264
It was really hard to see him like that.

21:06.723 --> 21:10.978
But I forced myself to do it anyway,
and I am really glad that I did.

21:14.648 --> 21:15.691
I'm around.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.944
I see him every morning and at night.

21:19.027 --> 21:20.612
That's not what I'm talking about.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.531
When David got sick, I took two weeks--

21:22.614 --> 21:24.241
Well, I'm not you, Ruth!

21:24.825 --> 21:28.412
Look, I know you just want to help
but I didn't ask for it.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.122
And I don't need it.

21:31.331 --> 21:32.249
I'm fine.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.216
You know, you tell me that a lot.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.428
That you're fine.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.932
Do what you want, Liv.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.561
But if you don't take this time with him…

21:54.229 --> 21:55.647
you're going to regret it.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.706
Am I forgetting anything?
What else?

24:17.789 --> 24:21.960
Soft cheese, undercooked meat,
fresh juice, raw fish or sushi.

24:22.043 --> 24:26.298
Oh, you're going to want to avoid
all wild poisonous berries.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.652
What if they are poisonous?

24:50.071 --> 24:51.448
You could die.

24:52.949 --> 24:55.494
Sooner. You could die sooner.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.303
Not real outdoorsy, are you?

26:33.675 --> 26:34.759
Sorry about that.

26:34.843 --> 26:37.470
Oh, no. No apology necessary.

26:37.554 --> 26:40.265
I was basically sick
my whole first pregnancy.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.604
So, are you staying here?
Because I thought you were living--

26:45.687 --> 26:47.063
Just for a couple of weeks.

26:48.523 --> 26:50.025
My place is…

26:52.736 --> 26:54.154
…being fumigated.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.448
Hmm.

26:58.700 --> 27:02.245
You know, I still think you could get more
for the place if you did some renos.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.497
I'm not changing it.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.250
In my experience,

27:07.334 --> 27:11.171
buyers don't like being confronted
with the previous owner's history.

27:13.548 --> 27:15.216
That's from Buenos Aires.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.261
My mother is Argentinian.

27:19.763 --> 27:20.930
She bought that…

27:22.015 --> 27:25.935
As a joke for my father
on their first date.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.230
But he kept it.

27:30.565 --> 27:31.733
For good luck.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.446
If that piece of history didn't exist…

27:38.448 --> 27:40.950
I might not be standing here
to pay you your commission.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.584
At the very least,
you should consider restaging it.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.128
But first,
we got to clear all of this out.

27:52.212 --> 27:55.507
Which is, to get rid of everything.

30:16.856 --> 30:18.358
These are the ones you eat.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.410
I'm good.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.163
I think I'm good.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.356
Oh, shit!

32:45.171 --> 32:46.172
Knock, knock.

32:47.048 --> 32:48.424
Lunch delivery.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.094
How's your dad doing?

32:52.762 --> 32:54.347
He's all right.

32:54.847 --> 32:56.015
Good. That's good.

32:58.101 --> 33:01.437
I didn't know if you prefer falafel
or shawarma, so I got us one of each.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.318
Can we not do this today?

33:10.154 --> 33:11.739
Sure. Um…

33:12.949 --> 33:14.117
I'll get you tomorrow.

33:15.535 --> 33:16.452
Actually…

33:21.082 --> 33:22.166
Can we just…

33:23.584 --> 33:25.044
not make this a thing?

33:28.548 --> 33:33.261
I just, I… I have this, uh, rhythm.

33:34.012 --> 33:38.266
And if you keep interrupting it,
it's not going to be good for me.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.313
I just, I really need to focus right now
and I can't…

33:46.065 --> 33:47.483
focus around you.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.310
Liv, what are you doing?

34:23.728 --> 34:27.065
It's getting dark.
Those clouds are still looking pretty low.

34:28.357 --> 34:29.442
Liv!

35:02.600 --> 35:04.268
Why did you come out here, Liv?

35:52.775 --> 35:54.318
-Oh, shit.

36:06.831 --> 36:10.251
Liv, thinking of you in Peru!

36:10.334 --> 36:13.421
Hugs and kisses, Mom.

36:14.630 --> 36:16.507
Liv, thinking of you…

36:16.591 --> 36:19.886
Liv, it's like a different world here!

36:20.595 --> 36:21.971
-Hugs and kisses.
-Liv…

36:22.054 --> 36:23.472
Inuvik until September.

36:23.556 --> 36:24.974
Hugs and kisses.

36:26.058 --> 36:27.143
Mom.

36:30.188 --> 36:34.025
"Inuvik until September. Mom."

36:47.163 --> 36:48.456
What are you so scared of?

36:51.292 --> 36:52.752
What if I'm like her?

36:54.128 --> 36:55.838
What if I'm just like her?

36:57.048 --> 36:58.591
I have to see her.

37:00.760 --> 37:01.802
I have to know.

37:09.185 --> 37:11.020
You want to tell me
what it is you think

37:11.103 --> 37:13.856
you're going to see
better out here at night than in the…

37:15.274 --> 37:16.400
day?

37:22.365 --> 37:23.658
What the hell is that?

37:25.910 --> 37:27.411
Do you think it's a town?

37:32.959 --> 37:34.043
I don't know.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.465
But I'm going to find out.
