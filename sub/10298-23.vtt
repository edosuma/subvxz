Hey, didn't I just pay bills
last month?

01:26.300 --> 01:28.367
Just the ones
stamped "final notice."

01:30.100 --> 01:31.400
This month we're doing the ones

01:31.400 --> 01:34.367
personally delivered
by the sheriff.

01:34.367 --> 01:36.000
Where's your mother?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.501
She said
she couldn't watch this.

01:37.501 --> 01:39.033
It depresses her.

01:39.033 --> 01:42.033
So she took your wallet,
and she went shopping.

01:42.033 --> 01:43.634
But if that damn woman
isn't here,

01:43.634 --> 01:45.300
who am I supposed to yell at?

01:48.934 --> 01:50.234
She left this.

01:50.234 --> 01:51.801
Go ahead, Dad.

01:54.033 --> 01:56.067
Yeow!

01:56.067 --> 02:00.367
Who could run up
a $260 phone bill?

02:00.367 --> 02:05.267
<i>PEGGY:
I'm sorry, Al.</i>

02:05.267 --> 02:06.901

All right.

02:14.234 --> 02:15.601
Yikes!

02:15.601 --> 02:18.767
A hundred and sixty dollars
for a haircut and a manicure?

02:18.767 --> 02:21.000
<i>I can explain
that one.</i>

02:21.000 --> 02:22.467
You better!

02:22.467 --> 02:24.467
<i>It was just
a one-time thing,</i>

02:24.467 --> 02:27.767
<i>and it'll never
happen again.</i>

02:27.767 --> 02:29.200
All right.

02:31.767 --> 02:32.968
Aah!

02:32.968 --> 02:36.501
Who spent $50
on a tape recorder?

Hey, I'm gonna do it.

03:10.934 --> 03:12.868
Ahh!

03:12.868 --> 03:15.100
Well, that's done.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.467
Now, let's see what's left

03:16.467 --> 03:19.334
to go into
the old savings account.

03:19.334 --> 03:22.033
Hey, a big nickel.

03:22.033 --> 03:24.734
See, kids, one day,
all that will be yours.

03:24.734 --> 03:26.767
I said one day!

03:28.367 --> 03:31.767
Dad, I hate to be the fly
in your Preparation H,

03:31.767 --> 03:34.000
but, uh...

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
you missed a bill.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.033
You know, Daddy,

03:37.033 --> 03:38.267
you should do
what Mom says:

03:38.267 --> 03:40.067
you should marry somebody
who's got a job.

03:40.067 --> 03:41.567
Didn't your mom
ever tell you that?

03:41.567 --> 03:42.567
No, honey.

03:42.567 --> 03:43.968
My mom told me
to marry an anchor

03:43.968 --> 03:46.033
and cling to it
as it sinks to the bottom.

03:47.267 --> 03:48.300
Chicko's Storage?

03:48.300 --> 03:50.334
What the hell
is Chicko's Storage?

03:50.334 --> 03:51.634
Our storage bin.

03:51.634 --> 03:53.334
What the hell
do you mean,
storage bin?

03:53.334 --> 03:54.901
Nobody told me
about a storage bin.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.200
What could we possibly
put in a storage bin?

03:57.200 --> 03:59.634
Thanks, Adolfo!

03:59.634 --> 04:01.968
Just put the rest
in the storage bin!

04:04.067 --> 04:05.300
Oh.

04:05.300 --> 04:06.534
[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

04:06.534 --> 04:08.267
Hi, honey.

04:10.100 --> 04:12.067
Hi, pookie.

04:12.067 --> 04:13.734
What you got there?

04:13.734 --> 04:15.567
Uh...

04:15.567 --> 04:17.901
it's a boar's head.

04:17.901 --> 04:20.500
I know, but what do you have
behind your back?

04:26.234 --> 04:27.367
No, I saw it, Daddy.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.734
It is a boar's head.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.434
Rest, honey.

04:33.601 --> 04:35.434
Peg, why did you buy
a boar's head?

04:35.434 --> 04:38.868
Well, if you must know,
it aroused me.

04:38.868 --> 04:41.067
Glassy eyes,
stuffing for brains,

04:41.067 --> 04:43.367
nothing below the neck.

04:43.367 --> 04:47.367
Nail it to a toilet bowl,
it could be you.

04:47.367 --> 04:49.567
No, it couldn't,
'cause unlike me,

04:49.567 --> 04:53.801
someone loved him enough
to put a bullet in his head.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.300
I can't live like this.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.167
I already got a dog
and three leeches.

05:03.167 --> 05:05.200
What am I gonna do
with a boar's head?

05:05.200 --> 05:06.267
All right.

05:06.267 --> 05:08.367
Kids, take that thing
to the garage.

05:08.367 --> 05:10.300
All right. Let's go.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.634
No, no, no, no!

05:11.634 --> 05:13.868
The boar's head.

05:13.868 --> 05:15.100
You gotta be

05:15.100 --> 05:16.968
a little bit more
specific, Mom, because--

05:16.968 --> 05:19.133
Yeah, I mean, usually
when you say "that thing,"

05:19.133 --> 05:20.934
you mean Dad.
I know.

05:20.934 --> 05:22.033
Peg, this has got to stop.

05:22.033 --> 05:23.901
Oh...

05:23.901 --> 05:27.000
I'll do with that thing
what I should've done to you
after the wedding:

05:27.000 --> 05:30.400
strap it to the hood of my car,
take it back to the woods
where it belongs.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.067
You can't take it back.

05:32.067 --> 05:33.667
I got it at a yard sale.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.801
Peg, don't you know

05:34.801 --> 05:36.234
the things you buy
at a yard sale

05:36.234 --> 05:37.467
are just junk?

05:37.467 --> 05:38.834
No, they're not.

05:38.834 --> 05:42.000
That's where I got
your reading glasses,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.868
and the brake linings
for your car

05:44.868 --> 05:47.701
and antibiotics for the kids.

05:49.467 --> 05:52.267
Besides, you buy a lot
of worthless junk, too,

05:52.267 --> 05:54.167
like your bowling ball.

05:54.167 --> 05:55.467
Peg, I go bowling.

05:55.467 --> 05:58.567
You don't go boaring.

05:58.567 --> 06:01.067
Well, once every
couple of months I do.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

06:04.100 --> 06:06.033
Yoo-hoo! It's me!

06:06.033 --> 06:07.033
See, Peg,

06:07.033 --> 06:10.300
this is why I tell you,
lock the door.

06:10.300 --> 06:13.234
Peggy, the most wonderful thing
happened.

06:13.234 --> 06:14.467
I have a date.

06:14.467 --> 06:15.734
Oh!

06:15.734 --> 06:16.901
Al!

06:16.901 --> 06:19.334
Marcy has a date!

06:19.334 --> 06:21.300
Gee, they must be
selling parkas in hell

06:21.300 --> 06:23.601
right now.

06:23.601 --> 06:27.634
Well, we can only hope
your dad can afford one.

06:27.634 --> 06:28.901
So, what's he like?

06:28.901 --> 06:30.133
Is he tall? Is he rich?

06:30.133 --> 06:31.300
Is he sighted?

06:35.100 --> 06:36.567
Al, Pick a hole
in your head

06:36.567 --> 06:38.834
and stick your finger
in it.

06:38.834 --> 06:40.734
Grownups are talking.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.834
Peggy, my mistake was
looking for a man to love,

06:43.834 --> 06:46.767
when all I really needed
was a man to hurt.

06:46.767 --> 06:49.801
I think I found him.
He's perfect.

06:49.801 --> 06:51.434
Are you going to
have sex with him?

06:51.434 --> 06:53.467
Well, you heard her say
she wants to hurt him.

07:00.534 --> 07:02.267
Anyway, this is not
something I'd admit

07:02.267 --> 07:03.934
in front of a man,

07:03.934 --> 07:05.968
but I'm a little nervous
about this sex thing.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.968
It's been
a long time.

07:07.968 --> 07:09.767
Three months.

07:09.767 --> 07:13.400
[LAUGHS]

07:13.400 --> 07:15.968
I could do three months
standing on my head.

07:17.601 --> 07:19.300
I'm just so used
to Steve.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.901
It was his
one strength.

07:20.901 --> 07:23.267
Well, that
and show tune trivia.

07:24.801 --> 07:26.801
But what if this guy's
no good at all?

07:26.801 --> 07:29.234
Well, you've come
to the right place.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.167
I'll tell you,

07:32.167 --> 07:34.067
the most important thing
the first few times

07:34.067 --> 07:35.067
is to make them feel

07:35.067 --> 07:36.367
like they're doing
a good job,

07:36.367 --> 07:38.000
even when they're not.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.968
You know,
I say things like,

07:39.968 --> 07:42.400
"Oh, honey, I wasn't
laughing at you.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.334
I was just thinking
of a joke."

07:45.334 --> 07:48.667
Oh, or, "You know,
when it's the real thing,

07:48.667 --> 07:51.367
it only has to take
but a minute."

07:51.367 --> 07:53.801
Oh, and you should always
keep a little cup of water

07:53.801 --> 07:55.534
by the side of the bed,

07:55.534 --> 07:57.000
sort of
sprinkle your brow.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.968
He'll really think
you're into it.

08:00.133 --> 08:01.667
I've gotten a few
"suffer, baby's"

08:01.667 --> 08:03.200
from Al
with that one.

08:04.834 --> 08:06.968
Oh, and then...

08:09.767 --> 08:11.033
if you have
a free hand,

08:11.033 --> 08:13.100
which I always do,

08:13.100 --> 08:15.334
you wanna just sort of
reach over to the clock

08:15.334 --> 08:17.200
and move it forward.

08:17.200 --> 08:20.367
It's a good
confidence builder.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.033
And always...

08:23.033 --> 08:26.567
practice moaning
to cover up your yawns.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.934
You know, I guess
what I'm saying is,

08:29.934 --> 08:31.367
you've just gotta
leave the man

08:31.367 --> 08:33.900
with something.

08:33.900 --> 08:36.234
Peg, you forgot
about your best secret move:

08:36.234 --> 08:39.534
you know, spitting Cracker Jacks
while you shout instructions.

08:40.933 --> 08:42.467
Oh, and the passionate

08:42.467 --> 08:44.100
"Remember, tomorrow's
garbage day"

08:44.100 --> 08:46.601
at just that right moment.

08:46.601 --> 08:51.367
See, I can't speak for all men,
but that turns me into a tiger.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.901
Dad, there's no more room
left in the garage.

08:55.901 --> 08:58.801
I had to take this out
to get the boar's head in.

08:58.801 --> 09:00.334
Hey, look what else Mom bought.

09:00.334 --> 09:03.200
<i>A collection
of Danish Dames magazines.</i>

09:03.200 --> 09:05.367
Hey! That's not mine.

09:09.968 --> 09:12.567
How-- How the heck
did those get in there?

09:12.567 --> 09:16.100
Damn vandals
must have left them.

09:16.100 --> 09:17.534
I'll make sure

09:17.534 --> 09:19.934
they're put in the trash
where they belong.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.133
Idiot.

09:22.634 --> 09:23.968
Peg, what's this?

09:23.968 --> 09:25.734
Oh, that's an ashtray

09:25.734 --> 09:27.501
that teaches you
geography.

09:30.734 --> 09:33.100
That way you can smoke
and learn.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.901
What a find!

09:34.901 --> 09:36.267
Where'd you get it?

09:36.267 --> 09:37.934
Hampee's garage sale.

09:37.934 --> 09:39.300
How could I
have missed it?

09:39.300 --> 09:40.634
I was there
when they opened.

09:40.634 --> 09:42.534
Did you see
the three-legged chair?

09:42.534 --> 09:44.067
Got it.
Damn!

09:44.067 --> 09:46.100
You know,
the only thing better

09:46.100 --> 09:47.467
than going to
a good garage sale

09:47.467 --> 09:48.934
is having your own.

09:48.934 --> 09:50.400
When I was
a little girl--

09:50.400 --> 09:52.868
Oh, help me!

09:52.868 --> 09:55.434
We'd have a garage sale
every summer.

09:55.434 --> 09:56.801
My mother
would sell anything:

09:56.801 --> 09:59.634
old lamp shades,
record albums,

09:59.634 --> 10:01.534
the training bra
off my back.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.434
What were you, about 25?

10:04.434 --> 10:05.901
I was 13

10:05.901 --> 10:08.701
and making more money
than you.

10:11.267 --> 10:14.367
Anyway, our garage sales
were always a big success.

10:14.367 --> 10:16.567
We made $500 once.

10:16.567 --> 10:19.133
My personal stuff
was the biggest seller.

10:19.133 --> 10:22.100
I guess when you see
a little girl cry

10:22.100 --> 10:24.501
as strangers pry
her cherished belongings

10:24.501 --> 10:25.934
out of her hands,

10:25.934 --> 10:28.534
people think
they're getting a real bargain.

10:28.534 --> 10:31.234
Why, the big 50 cents
they got for my dog Chester

10:31.234 --> 10:33.601
helped pay for that weekend
in the mountains

10:33.601 --> 10:36.100
my parents took without me.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.167
But I guess I would have been
a real downer,

10:38.167 --> 10:39.234
you know, screaming,

10:39.234 --> 10:40.901
"Chester, Chester,
please come home.

10:40.901 --> 10:44.033
I can't live without you."

10:44.033 --> 10:46.167
I don't think about it much...

10:46.167 --> 10:49.667
except for the times
when I wake up screaming.

10:56.501 --> 10:59.033
Five hundred dollars,
you say?

11:01.901 --> 11:04.100
Marcy just gave me a great idea.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.067
Peg, scrape the dog doody
off the grass.

11:06.067 --> 11:08.267
The Bundys
are having a yard sale.

11:25.200 --> 11:29.767
Al, I can't believe
you're doing this.

11:29.767 --> 11:31.133
You're selling
