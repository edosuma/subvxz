00:01.935 --> 00:03.936
(panting)

00:11.545 --> 00:13.445
(exclaiming)

00:34.301 --> 00:35.734
- Help me!

00:35.769 --> 00:37.536
Can you help me?

00:41.908 --> 00:43.308
Anne!

00:43.343 --> 00:44.643
- Diana?

00:44.678 --> 00:46.645
- Minnie May, she's sick!
We have to wake Miss Cuthbert!

00:46.680 --> 00:49.247
- She's not here.
She went to see the premier.

00:49.282 --> 00:51.283
Did your parents go as well?
- Yes!

00:51.318 --> 00:53.518
- What's wrong with Minnie May?
- I don't know.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.520
She's choking and coughing,
and it's horrible!

00:55.555 --> 00:58.323
- Croup.
- We need the doctor!

00:59.493 --> 01:02.261
- Matthew! Matthew, come quick!

01:03.497 --> 01:05.764
Put this on
before you catch your death.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.700
Aunt Josephine's staying with us
but she doesn't know what to do!

01:08.735 --> 01:10.435
She's never seen
a cough like this.

01:10.470 --> 01:11.937
- I have.

01:11.972 --> 01:14.739
Matthew, ride to Carmody
and fetch the doctor.

01:14.774 --> 01:16.942
Minnie May is gravely ill.
I'll go home with Diana.

01:16.977 --> 01:19.111
- We'll see you there.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.647
- Oh, Anne, she's fearful sick!

01:22.682 --> 01:24.583
(sobbing)
She can scarcely breathe!

01:24.618 --> 01:26.651
- I need to fetch the ipecac
before we go!

01:26.686 --> 01:29.921
Matthew won't be back for hours. I
will do everything I can until then!

01:29.956 --> 01:32.091
- I've missed you so much.
- I've missed you, too.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.276
(coughing)

02:27.781 --> 02:30.549
Lean her over. Make sure
she's right above the steam.

02:30.584 --> 02:33.652
We have to loosen the phlegm
that's choking her. (coughing)

02:33.687 --> 02:35.287
(sighing) We've used
almost all the ipecac.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.089
There's only one more dose.
I want to get by with steam

02:38.124 --> 02:40.192
and night air
until we're forced to use it.

02:40.227 --> 02:41.693
- She's burning up.

02:41.728 --> 02:43.929
- Let's lift her up
to the window.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.131
Breathing cold air will help.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.203
(coughing)

02:52.639 --> 02:54.606
- What on earth
do you think you're doing?!

02:54.641 --> 02:57.175
Do you wish her
to freeze to death as well?!

02:57.210 --> 03:00.178
- Cold air is a doctor's best friend
when it comes to treating croup.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.747
- You are not a doctor!
I do not condone this!

03:02.782 --> 03:04.382
- I know what I'm doing.

03:04.417 --> 03:07.052
Sorry. If you could please
stay out of the way...

03:07.087 --> 03:08.587
- Well!

03:10.657 --> 03:14.359
Dear God,
please save this child.

03:14.394 --> 03:16.394
- It's all right, Minnie May.

03:16.429 --> 03:18.563
Do you see the moon?

03:18.598 --> 03:20.599
Oh, isn't she lovely?

03:22.636 --> 03:24.569
She's watching over you.

03:24.604 --> 03:28.406
I wish you had some peppermint or
eucalyptus so I could make a plaster.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.209
(coughing)
I'll fetch an onion.

03:31.177 --> 03:32.911
Pardon me.

03:32.946 --> 03:36.047
- How much longer will it be
before that blasted doctor comes?!

03:36.082 --> 03:37.983
Oh, I hate the country.

03:38.018 --> 03:41.086
- Sorry! It really would help if
you could keep out of the way!

03:41.121 --> 03:42.988
- What would help would be
a medical professional.

03:43.023 --> 03:46.157
- I expect they'll be another
hour or two, if they come at all.

03:46.192 --> 03:47.826
- Why do you say that?

03:47.861 --> 03:50.629
- Almost everyone went to
Charlottetown to see the premier.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.665
- That is precisely why I left.
- It remains

03:52.691 --> 03:54.666
to be seen if the doctor
went along as well.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.935
- Next you'll be brewing
eye of newt in a cauldron.

03:56.970 --> 04:00.171
- Raw onion on the soles of the
feet helps bring a fever down.

04:00.206 --> 04:02.140
You haven't ever heard of that?

04:02.175 --> 04:05.143
- Why would I have?
- Because it's an old wives' tale.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.846
- I might be one,
but not the other.

04:07.881 --> 04:11.616
Evidently, one doesn't have
to be either thing to know it.

04:11.651 --> 04:14.352
- True enough. In any case,
I believe it works,

04:14.387 --> 04:16.421
and I'm not above
a desperate measure or two.

04:16.456 --> 04:18.757
- If I had a desperate measure
to offer, I would.

04:18.792 --> 04:22.727
But I know nothing of children or their
illnesses. (Minnie May coughing)

04:22.762 --> 04:26.331
- Mrs. Hammond had twins three times,
so I know quite a lot about it.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.066
- You were in service?

04:28.101 --> 04:30.602
- My whole life
before I came to Green Gables.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.304
- So the Cuthberts
brought you on

04:32.339 --> 04:34.839
to look after them
in their dotage, did they?

04:34.874 --> 04:36.608
- Oh, no.
I was supposed to be a boy.

04:36.643 --> 04:39.010
But when I wasn't, they decided
to keep me and raise me.

04:39.045 --> 04:40.478
- How extraordinary.

04:40.513 --> 04:42.981
- I agree!
- Anne!

04:43.016 --> 04:44.549
Anne! Anne!
(gasping)

04:44.584 --> 04:46.885
- Bring her over to the table!
Hurry!

04:48.488 --> 04:50.389
(gasping for breath)

04:53.093 --> 04:55.527
Roll her onto her belly.
Hold her feet.

04:55.562 --> 04:58.697
- Oh, dear God.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.700
Come on, Minnie May, cough!
Cough, Minnie May! Cough!

05:01.735 --> 05:04.336
- She's slipping!
- Miss Barry!

05:04.371 --> 05:07.972
Come on, Minnie May! Come on!
Cough, Minnie May! Cough!

05:08.007 --> 05:09.541
- She's not breathing!

05:11.478 --> 05:12.977
(choking)

05:13.012 --> 05:15.680
- Cough, Minnie May! Cough!
Come on, cough!

05:15.715 --> 05:17.649
Come on, cough! Cough!

05:17.684 --> 05:20.251
Cough, Minnie May! Cough!

05:20.286 --> 05:21.486
Please, please!
(coughing)

05:21.521 --> 05:24.022
That's good. That's very good.
(wheezing)

05:24.057 --> 05:25.824
- Oh, thank God.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.058
- Merciful Lord.

05:27.093 --> 05:28.593
- That's done it. Pull her up.

05:42.275 --> 05:45.377
You are going to be all better
very soon,

05:45.412 --> 05:47.512
and you have been very brave.

05:47.547 --> 05:50.115
- Oh, Anne...
- Oh...

05:53.253 --> 05:55.620
Let's get her to bed.

06:02.061 --> 06:04.396
I believe the worst is over.

06:07.734 --> 06:10.068
- I believe I need a brandy.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.411
(horse nickering)

06:33.426 --> 06:35.260
(owl hooting)

06:38.598 --> 06:41.433
- Your little redheaded girl
is as smart as they make them.

06:41.468 --> 06:44.669
She saved that child's life,
pure and simple.

06:44.704 --> 06:48.306
- I must admit,
she's got a presence of mind

06:48.341 --> 06:51.142
quite unusual
in a child her age.

06:51.177 --> 06:54.446
- I guess...
I'd best get her home.

06:59.285 --> 07:00.719
Anne.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.889
Anne...

07:04.958 --> 07:07.225
It's time to go.

07:08.795 --> 07:11.062
(birdsong)
(crows cawing)

07:13.666 --> 07:15.533
- Oh, Matthew,,,

07:15.568 --> 07:17.736
isn't it a beautiful morning?

07:20.773 --> 07:24.242
The trees look as if you could
blow them away with a breath.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.912
Poof!

07:32.919 --> 07:37.222
I'm so glad I live in a world where
there are white frosts, aren't you?

07:37.257 --> 07:40.959
- Yeah. - And I'm so glad Mrs.
Hammond had three pairs of twins,

07:40.994 --> 07:43.461
or I mightn't have known
what to do.

07:43.496 --> 07:46.264
- Life's funny... like that.

07:47.267 --> 07:50.902
- Won't Marilla be surprised
when she hears what she missed?

07:50.937 --> 07:52.604
- Won't she just.

08:11.558 --> 08:13.358
- Matthew?

08:14.394 --> 08:16.861
Matthew, are you all right?

08:16.896 --> 08:18.563
- Oh... Oh, good.

08:18.598 --> 08:20.398
You're back.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.033
Um, how was Charlottetown?

08:22.068 --> 08:24.936
- Why are you sleeping
in the middle of the day?

08:24.971 --> 08:26.704
- Uh-huh.
It's all right, Marilla.

08:26.739 --> 08:29.040
I expect Anne will sleep
the day away as well.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.543
- What's happened?
What's wrong? Is she ill?

08:31.578 --> 08:33.845
(mumbling)
- No need to fret.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.881
How about I tell you
over a cup of coffee?

08:36.916 --> 08:38.650
I could use some coffee.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.191
(birdsong)

08:57.770 --> 09:00.539
- You know what I...
- Oh, can I get you something?

09:02.208 --> 09:04.509
- You know...

09:04.544 --> 09:07.145
what was the best thing
about getting sick?

09:08.147 --> 09:10.548
Traveling west again.

09:10.583 --> 09:13.752
- I'll fetch you both some tea.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.055
- The train.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.424
God, I love a train.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.360
And those Rocky Mountains...

09:23.563 --> 09:25.630
- They're amazing.

09:25.665 --> 09:27.399
- Did my heart good.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.402
It's a big world, son.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.572
Remember that.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.613
<i>(knocking)</i>

09:46.653 --> 09:48.419
- Good afternoon, Marilla.

09:48.454 --> 09:50.088
- Eliza.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.059
- I've come to apologize.

09:55.094 --> 09:59.097
May I please see your
wonderful, remarkable Anne?

10:00.066 --> 10:02.066
- She's still sleeping,

10:02.101 --> 10:04.436
but you're welcome
to come on in.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.746
(whinnying)
- Good day, Mrs. Barry.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.448
- Thank you, Matthew.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.451
(cattle lowing)

10:25.291 --> 10:27.759
- Afternoon, Marilla.
We missed you.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.428
Did you see the premier?
What did he look like?

10:30.463 --> 10:33.531
- Well, he never got to be
Premier on account of his looks,

10:33.566 --> 10:36.300
but I was proud
of being a Conservative.

10:36.335 --> 10:39.437
Rachel, being a Liberal,
had no use for him.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.774
Come along and let's get you fed.
I expect you must be hungry.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.275
- I'm starving!

10:44.310 --> 10:47.111
Did Matthew recount the events
of last night?

10:47.146 --> 10:48.780
- He did.

10:48.815 --> 10:52.784
I must say it was fortunate
that you knew what to do.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.319
I wouldn't have had
any idea myself.

10:55.354 --> 10:56.954
I never saw a case of croup.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.990
- You know what was extra
wonderful about it all?

10:59.025 --> 11:01.926
I got to spend time
with my darling Diana.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.562
It's been an agony
not speaking at school,

11:04.597 --> 11:06.731
an utter agony.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.933
- It's been a long month indeed.

11:09.936 --> 11:12.470
- I was so sorrowful
to leave her this morning,

11:12.505 --> 11:15.106
knowing it'll all go back
to how it's been.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.777
- Take a few more bites.

11:19.712 --> 11:21.546
- Why?

11:21.581 --> 11:24.582
- Because when I tell you
who just visited here,

11:24.617 --> 11:27.952
your reaction will lift you
clear out of the region

11:27.987 --> 11:30.021
of such material matters
as appetite.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.424
Mrs. Barry paid a call today,

11:33.459 --> 11:35.927
and she hopes you'll forgive her

11:35.962 --> 11:38.996
and be good friends
with Diana again.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.998
(squealing)
- Oh, I'll wash it later!

11:41.033 --> 11:44.669
I can't tie myself down to
anything so unromantic as dishes

11:44.704 --> 11:46.771
at this thrilling moment!

11:46.806 --> 11:48.640
- Anne, take a coat!

11:51.577 --> 11:54.179
(lively music)

12:10.797 --> 12:12.563
- Gilbert?!

12:12.598 --> 12:14.232
(clanging)

12:14.267 --> 12:15.800
Gilbert!

12:15.835 --> 12:17.635
Gilbert!

12:19.438 --> 12:21.272
Gilbert!

12:31.918 --> 12:33.417
(squealing)

12:33.452 --> 12:35.253
- Anne! Anne!

12:35.288 --> 12:36.921
(squealing)

12:36.956 --> 12:38.956
- Diana! Oh!

12:38.991 --> 12:42.026
Oh, aren't you almost nearly
perfectly happy?

12:42.061 --> 12:45.096
Our separation has been
an excruciating torment,

12:45.131 --> 12:48.232
but I'm so relieved
it's finally over.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.735
- Mother could hardly keep us
apart since you saved Minnie May.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.338
Even Aunt Josephine said she'd be glad to
see you again, and she doesn't like anyone.

12:54.373 --> 12:56.307
- Wasn't she only staying
while your parents were away?

12:56.342 --> 12:59.143
- No, no, she's come to stay
with us for at least a month.

12:59.178 --> 13:01.746
I don't quite know how we'll stand it.
She's so very particular.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.848
But she's suffered a loss -
she's grieving -

13:03.883 --> 13:06.417
so she's disinclined to be
home alone in Charlottetown

13:06.452 --> 13:08.452
since her companion passed away.
- Her companion?

13:08.487 --> 13:11.256
- Her best friend
forever and ever.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.327
(Diana laughing)
(Anne sighing)

13:16.362 --> 13:19.530
Aunt Josephine never married.
Neither of them did.

13:19.565 --> 13:22.400
They lived with each other
their whole lives.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.902
- I'd live with you forever
if I could,

13:24.937 --> 13:28.339
but I know you'll leave me
the day you get married

13:28.374 --> 13:30.241
to some wealthy
and handsome gentleman.

13:30.276 --> 13:31.809
I hate him already.

13:31.844 --> 13:33.711
- How's Gilbert?

13:33.746 --> 13:37.448
- You're not funny. - You see him almost
every day after school, do you not?

13:37.483 --> 13:40.151
- Not because I want to!
It's because I have to.

13:40.186 --> 13:42.520
Mr. Phillips makes me go.
I've explained this to Ruby.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.889
Do I need to explain it to you
as well?

13:44.924 --> 13:47.391
I want to beat Gilbert
fair and square

13:47.426 --> 13:49.594
when he comes back to school.
(sighing)

13:49.629 --> 13:51.462
- Is his father almost well?

13:56.802 --> 13:59.136
- I think I'm a terrible person.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.305
- What? Why?

14:01.340 --> 14:03.207
- I hadn't thought about it
before.

14:03.242 --> 14:05.676
- Hadn't thought about what?

14:05.711 --> 14:08.112
- It's very likely
Gilbert's father

14:08.147 --> 14:10.548
isn't going to get well.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.851
So it's more than possible
that when Gilbert

14:13.886 --> 14:17.589
finally comes back to school,
he'll be an orphan.

14:19.058 --> 14:20.758
(bell ringing)

14:59.966 --> 15:02.600
"Let not your heart
be troubled.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.902
Ye believe in God;

15:04.937 --> 15:07.805
believe also in me."

15:08.741 --> 15:11.242
"In my Father's house
are many mansions.

15:11.277 --> 15:13.444
If it were not so,

15:13.479 --> 15:15.880
I would have told you.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.449
I go to prepare
a place for you.

15:18.484 --> 15:21.719
And if I go
and prepare a place for you,

15:21.754 --> 15:26.290
I will come again,
and receive you unto myself;

15:26.325 --> 15:31.429
for where I am,
there ye may be also."

16:40.900 --> 16:42.767
(indistinct chatter)

17:09.428 --> 17:11.562
- Oh, no, thank you.

17:21.073 --> 17:23.340
<i>(woman laughing)</i>

17:23.375 --> 17:26.877
- You laugh,
but I think it's a fine chapeau.

17:26.912 --> 17:28.712
Cosmopolitan.

17:28.747 --> 17:30.514
All the city folks
are wearing them.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.249
Why don't you like it?

17:32.284 --> 17:35.986
- Other than the fact that it's too
big for your head? - Room to grow.

17:36.021 --> 17:38.956
- I'm sure it'll fit better when
you acquire some more brains.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.724
(laughter)

17:40.759 --> 17:42.726
- Oh, show me mercy, Mar.

17:42.761 --> 17:44.629
Mercy, please.

17:48.934 --> 17:52.369
Perhaps this might persuade you
to offer me

17:52.404 --> 17:54.572
a morsel of kindness.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.974
- I make no promises.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.243
- I would expect none.

17:59.278 --> 18:00.645
May I?

18:37.716 --> 18:39.083
-<i> Marilla?</i>

18:40.119 --> 18:43.554
Are you all right, dear?
- I'm sorry, what?

18:43.589 --> 18:46.791
Oh, no, thank you.
I-I'm fine.

18:49.161 --> 18:50.828
(background chatter)

19:20.826 --> 19:22.293
Gilbert!

19:28.067 --> 19:30.534
It was a lovely service.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.536
It seemed fitting somehow;

19:32.571 --> 19:36.274
everything was so...
white and still.

19:37.243 --> 19:39.543
I've always thought
that the minister

19:39.578 --> 19:42.713
prays quite mournfully,
so this suited him nicely.

19:42.748 --> 19:44.749
Baptisms must be grim.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.653
Being an orphan
has its challenges,

19:49.688 --> 19:52.089
but you already
have so many advantages,

19:52.124 --> 19:54.892
you'll be much better off
than I was.

19:54.927 --> 19:59.129
And I didn't know my parents -
they died when I was a baby -

19:59.164 --> 20:02.733
so I couldn't fend for myself
the way that you can.

20:02.768 --> 20:05.402
And I don't remember
my parents at all,

20:05.437 --> 20:08.405
but you'll always be able
to remember your father.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.574
And you know,
when you think about it,

20:10.609 --> 20:12.476
you're really very lucky.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.445
- You think I'm lucky?

20:14.480 --> 20:16.914
- Compared to me? Yes.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.916
- And why is this about you?

20:18.951 --> 20:22.253
- It's not.
I was just trying to--

20:22.288 --> 20:23.788
- See you.

20:36.468 --> 20:38.269
- Ugh!

20:38.304 --> 20:42.406
Don't mind me, Gilbert Blythe!
I was only trying to help!

20:42.441 --> 20:43.774
Fine, then.
Don't get the benefits

20:43.809 --> 20:46.944
of my extensive knowledge
about being an orphan!

20:46.979 --> 20:48.612
(sighing)

20:48.647 --> 20:51.315
No matter how sad you look.

20:53.485 --> 20:57.187
All right, no need to think
about him any more. Done.

20:57.222 --> 21:00.291
I've wasted quite enough energy
on some dumb boy.

21:00.326 --> 21:04.395
I'm not going to think about Gilbert
Blythe for one more second.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.331
Brain: stop it!

21:07.366 --> 21:09.566
- Romance is a pesky business.
- Oh!

21:09.601 --> 21:11.268
(sighing)
Miss Barry.

21:11.303 --> 21:13.637
- No sense to be made of it.

21:13.672 --> 21:16.173
Hello, Anne.
- Hello.

21:16.208 --> 21:20.477
- Sorry to interrupt.
- No, no, I was... uh...

21:20.512 --> 21:22.913
- May I enter your humble abode?

21:23.949 --> 21:25.616
- Of course.

21:31.657 --> 21:33.590
- Ah...
(groaning)

21:33.625 --> 21:35.293
Ah.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.263
Cozy little retreat.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.931
- I-I should let you know
immediately

21:40.966 --> 21:43.867
that what you heard just now
had nothing to do with romance.

21:43.902 --> 21:45.369
- I see.
- Nothing whatsoever.

21:45.404 --> 21:48.472
I couldn't be less interested
in Gil...

21:48.507 --> 21:50.641
that boy.

21:50.676 --> 21:52.242
I've got much better things
to do.

21:52.277 --> 21:55.713
- You certainly seem like someone
with many possible outcomes.

21:55.748 --> 22:00.050
- Oh, you've no idea how much it
heartens me to hear you say that.

22:00.085 --> 22:02.353
- My advice is to let
your ambitions

22:02.388 --> 22:04.388
and your aspirations
be your guide.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.824
- But I have so many.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.392
- Oh, good.

22:08.427 --> 22:11.062
Plenty of time yet.
If you're lucky.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.732
- Right. Lucky.

22:14.767 --> 22:18.335
- There's more than enough time
for you to figure out

22:18.370 --> 22:21.238
what you want
and what you're good at.

22:21.273 --> 22:24.942
- I'd like to be very, very good
at something astonishing.

22:25.944 --> 22:27.578
I don't seem to fit in.

22:27.613 --> 22:30.547
All the girls I know are
preoccupied with becoming a wife.

22:30.582 --> 22:33.016
- And what do you think
about that?

22:33.051 --> 22:35.552
- Well, I've always wanted
to be a bride,

22:35.587 --> 22:38.422
but I don't really expect
to be a wife.

22:38.457 --> 22:40.357
- Interesting.

22:40.392 --> 22:42.693
- So you see the conundrum.
- I do.

22:44.129 --> 22:46.697
I have the following thoughts
to offer.

22:46.732 --> 22:52.336
First: you can get married anytime
in your life if you choose to do so.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.837
- That's true.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.706
- And two:
if you choose a career,

22:55.741 --> 22:57.374
you can buy
a white dress yourself,

22:57.409 --> 23:00.043
have it made to order,
and wear it whenever you want.

23:00.078 --> 23:02.880
- Oh.
Why didn't I think of that?

23:02.915 --> 23:05.716
(Miss Barry chuckling)
I love that idea!

23:05.751 --> 23:08.585
I'm going to be
my own woman.

23:08.620 --> 23:11.555
- I'm a proponent for making
one's own way in the world.

23:13.592 --> 23:15.392
Shall we?
(groaning)

23:15.427 --> 23:18.262
A certain young lady
has impressed upon me

23:18.297 --> 23:21.131
the many benefits
of taking the winter air.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.733
(both sighing)

23:22.768 --> 23:25.235
(Miss Barry groaning)
Thank you.

23:25.270 --> 23:27.772
Oh!
(both sighing)

23:28.774 --> 23:30.407
- Miss Barry?
- Hmm?

23:30.442 --> 23:32.075
- You are an inspiration.

23:32.110 --> 23:34.411
And I hope I know you
all my life.

23:34.446 --> 23:36.046
- I hope so, too.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.748
If you become a doctor,

23:37.783 --> 23:40.751
perhaps you can discover
a cure for old age.

23:40.786 --> 23:42.453
(chuckling)

23:44.623 --> 23:48.459
- And Miss Josephine Barry is
quite an intriguing character.

23:48.494 --> 23:51.094
She's independent
and never been married.

23:51.129 --> 23:53.464
She's definitely
my new role model.

23:53.499 --> 23:55.933
She helped me
see the light about...

23:55.968 --> 23:57.935
my future.

23:57.970 --> 24:01.338
You and Marilla
are also my inspirations.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.373
(Matthew): You don't say.

24:03.408 --> 24:05.008
- I do say.

24:05.043 --> 24:07.644
I'm going to be the heroine
in my own story.

24:07.679 --> 24:11.114
(Matthew): Well, now.
- I am quite firm in my position

24:11.149 --> 24:14.251
that romance
need not be my goal in life.

24:14.286 --> 24:17.387
Not that I'm thinking
about boys at all,

24:17.422 --> 24:18.956
because I'm not.

24:19.925 --> 24:21.558
I choose myself.

24:21.593 --> 24:24.595
And that way,
I'll never be disappointed.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.826
(sighing tearfully)

26:37.863 --> 26:39.597
(laughter)

26:41.099 --> 26:44.201
- If the key to a man's heart
is through his stomach--

26:44.236 --> 26:46.770
- Which it is.
- Then we have to make sure

26:46.805 --> 26:50.240
that this is the best shepherd's
pie that Gilbert has ever tasted.

26:50.275 --> 26:53.543
- Being a good cook shouldn't be
very high on the list

26:53.578 --> 26:55.646
of romantic attributes,
if you ask me.

26:55.681 --> 26:58.415
If one was interested
in romance, which I'm not,

26:58.450 --> 27:01.451
I'd like to be noticed for me,
not my dinner.

27:01.486 --> 27:03.487
(laughter)
- You're so funny, Anne.

27:03.522 --> 27:06.223
- I wasn't meaning to be funny.
- Oh.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.191
So what's on the list?

27:08.226 --> 27:10.861
- My brain, Diana.
My personality.

27:10.896 --> 27:12.696
As in, who I am.

27:12.731 --> 27:15.365
I'd like to believe
that's what truly matters.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.200
If romance matters at all.

27:17.235 --> 27:18.769
Which it doesn't.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.304
- Yes, it does!
(laughter)

27:21.339 --> 27:25.709
Don't you think Gilbert looks even
more handsome now that he's sad?

27:25.744 --> 27:28.478
- I didn't notice.
- He does. - I know!

27:28.513 --> 27:31.314
- Ruby and Gilbert
sitting in a tree,

27:31.349 --> 27:33.483
K-I-S-S-- - Minnie May,
we're trying to work.

27:33.518 --> 27:35.686
- I'm cooking.
- You're watching.

27:35.721 --> 27:39.289
I told you that the only way you get
to be here with us is if you're quiet.

27:39.324 --> 27:42.225
Don't interrupt, or you'll have to
go sit with Great Aunt Josephine.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.261
- No!!
(laughter)

27:45.263 --> 27:46.930
- Excuse me, ma'am.

27:50.068 --> 27:53.036
- I'm being quiet.

27:53.071 --> 27:55.706
- Then you're the only one.
Cackling hens.

27:55.741 --> 27:57.641
(girls giggling)
Lord help me.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.309
Take the boy
the godforsaken pie

27:59.344 --> 28:00.977
before I suffer
a mental collapse.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.013
(sighing)
- Sorry, Aunt Josephine.

28:03.048 --> 28:06.883
- You girls have been prattling
on for hours about nothing.

28:06.918 --> 28:09.019
A parlour
should be a quiet haven.

28:09.054 --> 28:10.654
Instead, it's unbearable.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.890
- "It is weak and silly
to say you cannot bear

28:13.925 --> 28:17.494
what it is your fate
to be required to bear."

28:17.529 --> 28:20.130
- I beg your pardon?

28:20.165 --> 28:22.866
- Jane Eyre.
Don't you just love it?

28:22.901 --> 28:25.602
- Ah.
I've yet to reach that bit.

28:25.637 --> 28:27.437
- Chapter six, I believe.

28:27.472 --> 28:30.040
Oh, and the ending
makes me weep every time.

28:30.075 --> 28:31.641
When Rochester--

28:31.676 --> 28:35.212
- For heaven's sake, didn't we just
establish that I've only begun it?

28:35.247 --> 28:36.713
- Sorry.

28:36.748 --> 28:39.349
Oh, I love crying
over a good book, don't you?

28:39.384 --> 28:42.219
- Thus far, I find the prose...

28:42.254 --> 28:44.554
invigorating.
(laughter)

28:44.589 --> 28:47.390
More so
if I could hear myself think.

28:47.425 --> 28:49.226
- We'll take the pie
straight over to Gilbert

28:49.261 --> 28:50.894
as soon as we're done,
Aunt Josephine.

28:50.929 --> 28:52.396
- Small mercies.

28:54.099 --> 28:56.333
I'll report back on the ending.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.640
(laughter)
- Is she always so surly?

29:03.675 --> 29:08.178
- She's always scary. The surly part
just worsened now that she's sad.

29:08.213 --> 29:10.047
(giggling)

29:13.051 --> 29:15.252
- It must be awful
beyond measure

29:15.287 --> 29:17.654
to lose someone
that you love deeply.

29:18.890 --> 29:22.526
In a split second,
a heartbeat...

29:22.561 --> 29:25.229
they're gone forever...

29:26.298 --> 29:29.366
...and there is nothing
that you can do to change it

29:29.401 --> 29:31.235
or bring them back.

29:35.373 --> 29:37.407
- Anne?

29:39.077 --> 29:41.245
You're crying on the potatoes.

29:43.248 --> 29:44.915
- I'm sorry.

29:45.917 --> 29:47.551
I'm sorry.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.419
(breathing shakily)

29:50.989 --> 29:53.857
- There's nothing wrong with saying
I'm sorry for your loss, Ruby.

29:53.892 --> 29:56.226
And I'm going to say it
because I am.

29:56.261 --> 29:59.729
- You'll just make it worse if you
say that! His father just died!

29:59.764 --> 30:02.065
- That's what people say
when someone dies.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.733
- I don't want you to upset him.

30:03.768 --> 30:06.002
- He's already upset
because his father just died!

30:06.037 --> 30:08.538
Anne, please tell Ruby
that it's alright to say--

30:08.573 --> 30:10.807
- I'm thinking perhaps
I should get on home.

30:10.842 --> 30:13.076
- What?
- Why?

30:13.111 --> 30:16.580
- I'm sure Marilla must be needing
my help... with something.

30:16.615 --> 30:19.416
- Don't be silly.
We're almost there.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.118
Hold my hand.

30:23.788 --> 30:25.322
I'm so nervous!

30:37.669 --> 30:41.805
We're sorry to intrude,
but we wanted you to have that.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.877
- We're sorry for your loss.
- It's a shepherd's pie.

30:46.912 --> 30:49.412
We made it together
especially for you.

30:49.447 --> 30:51.715
- Thank you.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.416
- We hope
you like shepherd's pie.

30:53.451 --> 30:55.285
- Everyone likes shepherd's pie.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.155
We hope it's a comfort to you,
Gilbert.

30:59.157 --> 31:00.757
- Anne made the topping.

31:00.792 --> 31:02.392
She's a good cook.

31:02.427 --> 31:04.228
- But I would make
a terrible wife!

31:20.312 --> 31:23.780
- Well, um...
thank you for stopping by.

31:33.391 --> 31:35.125
(birdsong)

31:36.661 --> 31:38.462
(chickens clucking)

31:47.973 --> 31:50.307
- Marilla,
did you ever want to marry?

31:51.810 --> 31:53.810
- I...

31:53.845 --> 31:57.447
There was a time
when I thought I would, but...

31:57.482 --> 31:58.949
it wasn't possible.

31:58.984 --> 32:01.251
Now come set the table,
please.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.454
- That sounds rather tragical.

32:04.489 --> 32:06.556
Why wasn't it possible?

32:06.591 --> 32:08.425
Were you a woman scorned?

32:08.460 --> 32:10.327
- I was not.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.930
I was needed at home.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.398
- Forever?

32:15.433 --> 32:16.900
- Well...

32:16.935 --> 32:19.736
that's just how things
worked out.

32:19.771 --> 32:23.406
My mother never recovered
from my older brother's death.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.575
She...
(sighing)

32:25.610 --> 32:27.444
I was needed here.

32:28.446 --> 32:30.781
Now let me
get the breakfast on.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.427
- I'll just add this on.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.964
Now, you'll settle up today,
Matthew.

32:54.639 --> 32:57.975
- Hello, Gilbert.
- Oh, good day, Mr. Cuthbert.

32:58.910 --> 33:00.710
- So, uh...

33:00.745 --> 33:02.812
bit of a cold snap, eh?

33:02.847 --> 33:04.414
- True enough.

33:05.583 --> 33:08.085
- Uh, the other day
at the, uh...

33:10.588 --> 33:14.024
I-I noticed you had to leave
a couple fields go fallow.

33:14.059 --> 33:15.992
- I haven't decided yet.
- I'm sorry?

33:16.027 --> 33:18.995
- I'll let you know
if I'm going to sell.

33:19.030 --> 33:20.563
- Oh.

33:20.598 --> 33:22.532
No, no, no.

33:22.567 --> 33:24.267
I just, um...

33:26.438 --> 33:30.106
I only wanted you to know
that me and my hand Jerry,

33:30.141 --> 33:32.275
we'd be real happy to help out.

33:32.310 --> 33:35.745
We'll come on over
in the spring if you like.

33:35.780 --> 33:37.647
Get you back up and running.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.449
- That's very kind.

33:41.786 --> 33:43.453
Truth is, uh...

33:44.456 --> 33:47.657
...I never really wanted
to be a farmer.

33:51.629 --> 33:53.630
Well, I'd best get to it.

34:02.140 --> 34:05.408
- As I was saying, I wonder
if you could settle up today.

34:05.443 --> 34:09.045
Shame about that vessel. Word on the
street is, you had crops aboard.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.114
- Vessel?

34:11.149 --> 34:14.284
- You didn't hear? Ship went
down on the way to the mainland.

34:14.319 --> 34:17.253
- Out of... Charlottetown?

34:17.288 --> 34:19.522
- Mm-hmm. The vendor
didn't have insurance,

34:19.557 --> 34:21.458
so there's no recouping
the loss.

34:21.493 --> 34:24.060
It's a cryin' shame,
is what it is.

34:24.095 --> 34:26.930
Now, that'll be $6.10, Matthew.

34:30.435 --> 34:32.735
- What was the name of the ship?

34:32.770 --> 34:34.304
- The Dal Marie.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.287
- Hey, Gilbert!

34:52.624 --> 34:54.257
How's it going, Blythe?

34:54.292 --> 34:55.758
- Fine.

34:55.793 --> 34:58.027
- You gotta come back to school,
bud.

34:58.062 --> 35:00.029
That ugly orphan's
out of control.

35:00.064 --> 35:01.498
- What do you care?

35:01.533 --> 35:04.334
- We need a guy to show her
she's not so smart.

35:04.369 --> 35:05.869
- She's smart.

35:05.904 --> 35:07.704
Deal with it.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.373
- Why you gotta be like that, bud?
(chuckling)

35:10.408 --> 35:13.877
- Why don't you bust out a book
and take care of it yourself?

35:13.912 --> 35:16.212
- Yeah, right. Good one, bud.

35:16.247 --> 35:18.781
- I'll give you a tip, okay?
- Yeah?

35:18.816 --> 35:20.817
- I'm not your bud.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.886
- Yeah, right.
(chuckling)

35:22.921 --> 35:25.255
- And if you ever
hassle Anne again,

35:25.290 --> 35:26.923
you'll regret it.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.259
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, right.

35:31.095 --> 35:32.662
- What's your problem?

35:33.932 --> 35:35.632
- Ask me that again.

35:36.601 --> 35:38.935
No, seriously. Go ahead.

35:39.938 --> 35:42.606
- Why you gotta be like that?
- Ask me!

35:45.777 --> 35:47.911
- Come on, bud. I don't get you.

35:47.946 --> 35:50.013
Seriously, what's your problem?

35:52.083 --> 35:53.650
(grunting)

35:55.720 --> 35:57.654
(grunting)

35:58.656 --> 36:00.891
(crying out)
(grunting)

36:09.200 --> 36:10.800
(grunting)
(panting)

36:29.754 --> 36:32.589
(wind whistling)

36:41.299 --> 36:43.066
- Gilbert.

36:43.101 --> 36:44.734
I'm sorry to intrude.

36:44.769 --> 36:46.402
- Oh, no, not at all,
Miss Cuthbert.

36:46.437 --> 36:48.271
Please... take your time.

36:52.277 --> 36:55.378
- I wonder how he feels
about being so stationary.

36:55.413 --> 36:58.081
John was a traveler at heart.

36:59.117 --> 37:03.019
- I believe the military moved him
around a lot in his early years.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.622
- He had the life he wanted,
then.

37:05.657 --> 37:07.290
Full of adventure.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.028
I'd heard he'd settled
in Alberta?

37:12.063 --> 37:13.863
- Um...

37:13.898 --> 37:16.900
we were a... large family
for a while.

37:18.736 --> 37:21.304
I'm the last. The only.

37:21.339 --> 37:23.273
- I'm sorry.

37:23.308 --> 37:25.008
- No, it's okay.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.746
We moved back here
right after I was born.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.717
(chuckling)
The prodigal sons.

37:34.752 --> 37:37.420
That's what he used
to call us.

37:37.455 --> 37:40.757
He took me back there recently.
Alberta.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.327
He wanted to see it again.

37:44.362 --> 37:46.596
It's beautiful.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.499
- In school,

37:49.534 --> 37:51.868
back when we were acquainted,

37:51.903 --> 37:54.237
John talked of big cities,

37:54.272 --> 37:57.073
of other parts of the world.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.409
It seemed...

37:59.444 --> 38:01.011
impossible.

38:03.381 --> 38:04.848
- Sounds good to me.

38:06.884 --> 38:09.286
- You resemble him in many ways.

38:14.726 --> 38:17.894
There was nothing he could say
to talk me into leaving.

38:19.564 --> 38:21.230
I wish...

38:21.265 --> 38:23.866
- He... he asked you
to go with him?

38:23.901 --> 38:28.405
- I'll always be grateful to him
for thinking I'd be brave enough.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.408
Obligation...

38:32.910 --> 38:34.911
...can be a prison.

38:36.914 --> 38:38.748
I've always wondered...

38:41.753 --> 38:43.553
I'll take my leave.

38:43.588 --> 38:47.657
Please reach out to us
if you need anything at all.

38:47.692 --> 38:50.660
- Thank you... Miss Cuthbert.

39:17.722 --> 39:19.556
(soft music)

39:55.259 --> 39:58.094
(sighing)
- That is not what I meant.

40:11.609 --> 40:13.143
(pounding)

40:17.448 --> 40:19.248
Hello, Mary Joe.
May I come in?

40:19.283 --> 40:21.785
- Are you wanting Diana? She's gone out.
- No!

40:22.653 --> 40:24.487
I'm sorry to bother you,
Miss Barry,

40:24.522 --> 40:27.924
but I have a pressing need to ask you
something and you're my designated mentor.

40:35.032 --> 40:36.432
Oh. I'm sorry.

40:36.467 --> 40:39.102
- Oh, it's quite all right,
child.

40:40.304 --> 40:42.138
- I should go.
- No.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.474
No.

40:49.814 --> 40:51.614
Oh.

40:51.649 --> 40:53.449
(sighing)

40:53.484 --> 40:56.285
Emotion is rarely convenient

40:56.320 --> 40:58.454
and often intolerable,

40:58.489 --> 41:00.890
but I find, at the moment,

41:00.925 --> 41:02.959
that I don't mind it.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.195
- I'm sorry.

41:06.264 --> 41:08.397
Grief is confusing.

41:08.432 --> 41:11.734
- Grief is the price you pay
for love, you see.

41:11.769 --> 41:13.937
So... it's all right.

41:15.773 --> 41:18.508
I miss my dear Gertrude
very much.

41:18.543 --> 41:20.944
And I loved her
with all my heart.

41:21.946 --> 41:24.113
- She was your kindred spirit.

41:25.082 --> 41:27.617
- Yes.

41:28.619 --> 41:30.954
- I admire you, Miss Josephine.

41:32.290 --> 41:33.923
You're my role model.

41:33.958 --> 41:36.759
- Oh, dear.
(laughing and sniffling)

41:36.794 --> 41:39.762
- I aspire
to utilize my intellect fully

41:39.797 --> 41:43.199
and never succumb
to frivolities such as romance.

41:43.234 --> 41:46.002
- Then you wouldn't be
much like me at all.

41:46.037 --> 41:49.438
- But you and I
are not the marrying kind.

41:49.473 --> 41:52.642
- Ah, but I was, in my way.

41:53.644 --> 41:57.113
And we had a full
and wonderful life together.

41:57.148 --> 41:59.348
I have no regrets.

41:59.383 --> 42:02.251
That's all
you really have to decide, Anne,

42:02.286 --> 42:05.255
to live a life with no regrets.

42:17.935 --> 42:19.936
(soft music)

42:33.951 --> 42:35.952
(soft music)

42:40.791 --> 42:42.792
(music swelling)

43:22.066 --> 43:24.667
(soft music)

43:30.941 --> 43:33.109
(music fading)

44:00.905 --> 44:02.872
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal

44:02.907 --> 44:04.907
(grunting)
- Ah!
