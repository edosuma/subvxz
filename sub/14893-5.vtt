00:06.556 --> 00:08.063
So 100 men are trapped

00:08.098 --> 00:09.034
at the bottom of the ocean,

00:09.102 --> 00:11.837
getting slowly cooked
by nuclear radiation?

00:11.905 --> 00:13.439
I am running against you,

00:13.506 --> 00:17.009
and I will resign after
we have saved those men.

00:17.077 --> 00:18.677
This is how it works, Douglas:

00:18.745 --> 00:21.747
You help me by giving me
everything I need to know

00:21.815 --> 00:23.082
about your mother's plan.

00:23.149 --> 00:25.250
You came to me,

00:33.426 --> 00:34.593
You're already involved.

00:34.661 --> 00:36.428
Congressman Reeves

Sam, call an ambulance!

00:46.439 --> 00:47.806
The winches are lowered now,

00:47.874 --> 00:50.142
and we believe the salvage teams
are about to arrive at depth.

00:50.210 --> 00:53.612
These divers are from the Navy's
elite Mobile Unit One

00:53.680 --> 00:55.014
out of Hawaii.

00:55.081 --> 00:58.017
Tonight, they risk their lives
for 100 Chinese strangers,

00:58.084 --> 00:59.785
stuck in 600 feet of water,

00:59.853 --> 01:01.620
13 miles off the coast
of San Diego.

01:01.688 --> 01:04.757
The waiting's almost over now.

01:04.824 --> 01:06.859
It's not just the lives
of our Navy divers

01:06.926 --> 01:08.727
and the Chinese crew...

01:08.795 --> 01:10.796
I think we all know
what's at stake here.

01:15.568 --> 01:17.603
Approaching
with cable number one.

01:17.671 --> 01:19.672
Ten meters and closing.

01:23.176 --> 01:25.177
Five meters.

01:29.516 --> 01:32.718
Three.

01:32.786 --> 01:35.320
Two.

01:35.388 --> 01:37.723
One...

01:39.025 --> 01:40.959
They want to keep him sedated,

01:41.027 --> 01:42.795
until all the cocaine's
out of his system.

01:42.862 --> 01:44.396
I think they gave him too much.

01:44.464 --> 01:45.764
Mother!

01:45.832 --> 01:48.267
Like I don't have enough
anxiety just with the overdose.

01:48.334 --> 01:51.336
Dad, Mom... can I
talk to you for a second?

01:53.306 --> 01:55.641
Uh...

01:55.709 --> 01:58.610
So between the security guards
and the three EMTs,

01:58.678 --> 02:00.979
there's a total of six
witnesses that we know of.

02:01.047 --> 02:02.881
I spoke to Gary
at the press office...

02:02.949 --> 02:04.283
he's already getting calls.

02:04.350 --> 02:06.618
We cannot cover this one up.
I'll call Bobby Cartwright.

02:06.686 --> 02:08.152
Now, he'll know what to do.

02:08.221 --> 02:10.788
We are not hiring a fixer.

02:10.857 --> 02:13.192
Between phone videos
and pictures,

02:13.259 --> 02:14.993
or some hospital flunky

02:15.061 --> 02:16.395
wanting to release
his medical records...

02:16.463 --> 02:17.763
Call Susan Berg.

02:18.798 --> 02:20.532
Mom, that is...

02:20.600 --> 02:22.000
Tell her we want to meet.

02:22.068 --> 02:23.869
I don't have time to argue
with you about this, Douglas.

02:23.937 --> 02:24.870
Just do it.

02:24.938 --> 02:25.904
He's my twin brother.

02:25.972 --> 02:27.306
I'd like to be here
when he wakes up.

02:27.373 --> 02:29.508
And I would give anything
to do the same thing,

02:29.576 --> 02:32.211
but you and I have to
help him in other ways.

02:32.278 --> 02:33.445
I'll stay with him.

02:33.513 --> 02:35.214
Now, you do what you gotta do,

02:35.281 --> 02:37.316
but I'm gonna be
right here by his side.

02:41.588 --> 02:45.524
They're going to release him
in a day or so...

02:45.592 --> 02:46.892
I want him to move in with us.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.494
Would you and Anne

02:48.561 --> 02:51.063
set up the guest room for him
and get the house ready?

02:51.131 --> 02:52.664
We'll make his room perfect.

02:52.732 --> 02:54.566
She meant dump the booze.

02:54.634 --> 02:56.101
I mean get his room ready.

02:56.169 --> 02:59.104
And yes, get rid of whatever...
substances.

02:59.172 --> 03:00.739
Just like last January,
after rehab.

03:00.807 --> 03:03.308
Yeah, a lot of good that did.

03:21.394 --> 03:25.297
Yes. To an antibiotic
that they prescribed for T.J.,

03:25.365 --> 03:28.267
and he went into
anaphylactic shock.

03:28.334 --> 03:31.503
So they rushed him
to the ER, and, uh,

03:31.571 --> 03:33.438
got some fluids in him,
some epinephrine...

03:33.506 --> 03:36.708
Thankfully, he's doing
much better now.

03:36.776 --> 03:37.876
Okay...

03:37.944 --> 03:40.679
Are the hospital records
available?

03:40.747 --> 03:42.414
Those are confidential.

03:42.482 --> 03:46.185
You two don't really
expect me to believe this.

03:46.252 --> 03:47.619
It's not important
that you believe it.

03:47.687 --> 03:49.221
What's important is
that you write down

03:49.289 --> 03:50.556
exactly what I'm telling you.

03:50.623 --> 03:52.991
I don't transcribe
press releases.

03:53.059 --> 03:54.660
It's my job to
discern the truth,

03:54.727 --> 03:56.728
and what you just said
doesn't have a whiff of it.

03:56.796 --> 04:00.098
Susan, I would like you
to write it anyway.

04:00.166 --> 04:02.234
I... won't use my reputation

04:02.302 --> 04:05.103
or that of my paper to quell
the speculation surrounding T.J.

04:05.171 --> 04:07.039
I just... I...
I won't do it.

04:07.106 --> 04:11.643
And if I were willing to
breach National Security...

04:11.711 --> 04:13.312
Mom...

04:13.379 --> 04:16.281
...and give you a story
in exchange for this?

04:17.517 --> 04:20.219
I'm listening.

04:20.286 --> 04:23.222
I want you to know that as Secretary
of State...

04:23.289 --> 04:26.658
...I would never do anything
to deceive the American public.

04:26.726 --> 04:29.161
But as a mother...

04:29.229 --> 04:32.097
I would do anything
to help my son.

04:34.133 --> 04:35.834
There is a Chinese submarine

04:35.902 --> 04:37.536
lying on the floor
of the Pacific Ocean

04:37.604 --> 04:38.937
off the coast of San Diego.

04:39.005 --> 04:41.673
The Chinese are pretending
it's not there--

04:41.741 --> 04:44.243
that they weren't
caught spying on us--

04:44.310 --> 04:46.578
and they're willing to
let their own men die.

04:46.646 --> 04:49.081
President Garcetti is doing

04:49.148 --> 04:52.150
everything he can
to rescue them.

04:52.218 --> 04:53.785
Douglas is headed
out there now.

04:53.853 --> 04:55.988
There's room on the plane,

04:56.055 --> 04:57.956
and you would be the only
press person on the ground

04:58.024 --> 05:01.360
with unlimited access
to the rescue operation.

05:01.427 --> 05:02.394
Oh...

05:02.462 --> 05:05.898
Didn't know you
were all here...

05:05.965 --> 05:08.834
Annie, babe. Hi.

05:08.902 --> 05:11.403
You, um, you remember
Susan Berg, right?

05:11.471 --> 05:12.738
We've met.

05:12.805 --> 05:14.006
Nice to see you again.

05:14.073 --> 05:15.240
- Hi, Annie.
- Hi.

05:15.308 --> 05:16.708
Hey, what are these?

05:16.776 --> 05:18.577
Oh, stuff for, um,
T.J.'s room.

05:20.713 --> 05:22.648
- Sorry... I feel like I'm interrupting something.
- You're not interrupting.

05:22.715 --> 05:24.883
Douglas and Susan were
just getting ready

05:24.951 --> 05:27.953
to fly to San Diego,
isn't that right?

05:32.292 --> 05:33.659
Cool.

05:37.063 --> 05:38.997
Hi, Alice...

05:39.065 --> 05:42.000
Well, did he say when or where?

05:42.068 --> 05:43.402
Okay... Yeah.
No, I'll tell her.

05:46.306 --> 05:47.339
Um, DCM Han.

05:47.407 --> 05:48.941
He wants to meet
with you immediately.

05:49.008 --> 05:51.710
He's on his way over.

05:56.582 --> 05:58.917
I asked you not to get
involved, Madam Secretary.

05:58.985 --> 06:00.619
And you do the opposite.

06:00.687 --> 06:02.921
You said <i>you</i> could not
get involved, Lee Bao.

06:02.989 --> 06:04.189
We are saving your men.

06:04.257 --> 06:07.125
You're making a mistake.

06:07.193 --> 06:09.728
Your government must cease
all rescue operations.

06:09.796 --> 06:11.596
The hardware is too valuable.

06:11.664 --> 06:14.366
We cannot have the CIA poking
around our technology.

06:14.434 --> 06:17.736
Your hardware is
your priority, Lee Bao?

06:17.804 --> 06:19.137
The truth is, Elaine...

06:19.205 --> 06:21.373
orders have been communicated.

06:21.441 --> 06:23.175
If you try to rescue them,

06:23.242 --> 06:25.210
the crew will be forced
to scuttle the ship.

06:25.278 --> 06:30.716
You mean, releasing the nuclear
material off of California?

06:30.783 --> 06:33.085
22 million people live
along that coastline.

06:33.152 --> 06:34.419
Are you insane?

06:34.487 --> 06:36.388
There is nothing I can do.

06:36.456 --> 06:38.490
You can get Tong on the line.

06:38.558 --> 06:39.958
Now.

06:40.026 --> 06:41.360
You are not setting off

06:41.427 --> 06:43.895
an underwater dirty
bomb off our coast.

06:43.963 --> 06:46.565
This is above Tong.

06:46.632 --> 06:48.266
Who is above your President?

06:48.334 --> 06:49.968
Navy Intelligence.

06:51.204 --> 06:53.138
The only way to
avoid catastrophe

06:53.206 --> 06:55.474
is for the United States
to stand down.

A nuclear-powered
Chinese warship

07:50.797 --> 07:52.164
marooned off
the California coast,

07:52.231 --> 07:54.032
lives hanging in the balance--

07:54.100 --> 07:57.702
this is gonna be everywhere,

Spit it out.
I'm in a hurry. Right...

08:09.715 --> 08:12.284
Hopping on a State Department
jet with <i>Douglas</i> Hammond.

08:12.351 --> 08:13.685
I have access.

08:13.753 --> 08:15.487
I have a vantage-point on
a huge international incident

08:15.555 --> 08:16.822
no other reporter has.

08:16.889 --> 08:18.857
I never thought I would
have to accuse you

08:18.925 --> 08:20.992
of being in the back pocket
of the Hammond family.

08:21.060 --> 08:23.161
Then don't.

08:23.229 --> 08:24.362
You're saying these stories

08:24.430 --> 08:26.331
have nothing to do
with one another?

08:26.399 --> 08:28.667
Don't over-think it, Alex.

08:28.734 --> 08:30.368
You bitch about
losing eyeballs...

08:30.436 --> 08:33.138
I just brought a few more
back to our dear, old <i>Globe.</i>

08:33.206 --> 08:34.739
And I'll bring even more

08:34.807 --> 08:36.775
when I report
the submarine being raised.

08:36.842 --> 08:39.845
So just keep your eye
on the inbox.

08:44.082 --> 08:48.019
"...President Hammond is a dog,
and only a fool

08:48.087 --> 08:52.891

09:10.743 --> 09:13.812
This is not opinion.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.480
It's judgment.

09:15.548 --> 09:18.049
The First Family is
phony good-old-boy-ism

09:18.117 --> 09:21.353
and empty
"women first" chatter...

09:21.420 --> 09:23.488
This... is very clever.

09:23.556 --> 09:26.057
It is also... very mean.

09:26.125 --> 09:27.425
You're better than this.

09:27.493 --> 09:28.627
Because it isn't worthy?

09:28.694 --> 09:31.062
Or because a female opinion
gets different scrutiny?

09:31.130 --> 09:32.264
Bullshit.

09:32.331 --> 09:33.965
There are eight
opinion columnists

09:34.033 --> 09:35.834
at this paper, all men.

09:35.902 --> 09:37.903
You'll have to excuse me now.

09:48.981 --> 09:51.248
<i>The long-term damage
to the maritime industry</i> ONE

09:51.316 --> 09:54.986
could reach easily into
tens of billions of dollars.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.989
And for the population
along the Western Seaboard,

09:58.056 --> 09:59.390
health effects are
hard to predict,

09:59.458 --> 10:01.759
but nevertheless certain.

10:01.827 --> 10:04.795
That's a hell of a thank you
for trying to rescue their men.

10:04.863 --> 10:06.097
Mr. President...

10:06.164 --> 10:08.132
We agree that the threat
is a bluff.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.234
Even if they meant to
bluff, they've said it now.

10:10.302 --> 10:13.437
The Chinese have to
follow through to save face.

10:13.505 --> 10:16.340
Can we all just agree that the
rescue attempt is off the table?

10:16.408 --> 10:18.909
Chinese Naval Intelligence
is not in charge

10:18.977 --> 10:20.244
of the Chinese military.

10:20.312 --> 10:22.513
And I get the sense
that President Tong

10:22.581 --> 10:25.316
needs to reassert control
over these Admirals...

10:25.384 --> 10:26.484
"You get the sense?"

10:26.551 --> 10:29.120
They were caught
spying off our shores.

10:29.187 --> 10:31.322
We're attempting to
do the humane thing

10:31.390 --> 10:32.590
by rescuing their crew...

10:32.657 --> 10:34.759
and now we're expected
to stand down

10:34.826 --> 10:36.694
because this bunch of thugs--

10:36.762 --> 10:39.530
who are not even in charge--
are threatening us.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.532
Elaine.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.067
We didn't pick this fight.

10:43.135 --> 10:45.403
The Chinese did.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.438
I'm sure they don't want
to let their Admirals

10:47.506 --> 10:49.874
start a Third World War
just to save face.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.642
No. Elaine's right.

10:51.710 --> 10:53.010
We tell them now--

10:53.078 --> 10:55.846
and in no uncertain terms--
that this will not stand.

10:55.914 --> 10:57.515
Mr. President...

10:57.582 --> 10:58.916
Fred, I appreciate your opinion,

10:58.984 --> 11:00.785
but this is exactly the type
of decision

11:00.852 --> 11:02.053
people elected me to make.

11:04.623 --> 11:06.223
Keep the rescue ships in place.

11:06.291 --> 11:09.593
Barry, schedule an address
from the Oval in the next hour.

11:09.661 --> 11:10.694
Yes, sir.

11:12.764 --> 11:14.899
Elaine...

11:14.966 --> 11:17.902
I'd like you to help me
write the speech.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.804
Yes, sir.

11:33.685 --> 11:35.352
You're sure fond
of that bathroom.

11:35.420 --> 11:37.388
What's that mean?

11:37.456 --> 11:39.690
Oh, nothing.

11:39.758 --> 11:42.393
Regularity's the first
thing that goes when you age.

11:42.461 --> 11:44.028
So enjoy it while you can.

11:45.130 --> 11:47.164
Okay, you do the extreme
room makeover

11:47.232 --> 11:49.200
and I'll case the place
for drugs.

11:49.267 --> 11:51.368
You think really think T.J.
keeps drugs inside

11:51.436 --> 11:52.636
the Secretary of State's house?

11:52.704 --> 11:54.905
Well, of course he does,
he's an addict.

11:54.973 --> 11:56.874
I wouldn't be surprised
if somewhere in here

11:56.942 --> 11:59.143
he hasn't hidden a go-go boy.

11:59.211 --> 12:01.312
Oh, let me help you with that.

12:01.379 --> 12:02.680
Oh, yeah, thanks.

12:07.752 --> 12:09.353
"Grass-fed filet"?

12:11.556 --> 12:13.023
The spaghetti alla panna's
better.

12:13.091 --> 12:16.026
Your whole life has been like
this, hasn't it?

12:16.094 --> 12:19.063
First class, chauffeurs
and private chefs.

12:19.131 --> 12:22.900
Bodyguards and
bomb-sniffing dogs,

12:22.968 --> 12:25.536
paparazzi at my junior prom.

12:25.604 --> 12:27.738
Okay, I get it.
Yeah?

12:27.806 --> 12:29.106
Did someone film you dancing

12:29.174 --> 12:31.275
to the Backstreet Boys
before you were old enough

12:31.343 --> 12:32.910
to realize tuxedo shorts
weren't cool?

12:32.978 --> 12:33.978
I remember that video.

12:35.413 --> 12:37.214
<i>Saturday Night Live</i> did
a great spoof.

12:39.417 --> 12:42.253
What was it like...

12:42.320 --> 12:43.621
growing up in the White House?

12:43.688 --> 12:45.389
Thank you.

12:48.293 --> 12:51.095
This is starting to sound
a little reporter-y.

12:51.163 --> 12:54.498
No, I'm just curious,
personally.

12:54.566 --> 12:58.269
I mean, I, we, every reporter
in DC spent those eight years

12:58.336 --> 12:59.770
peering into your family,

12:59.838 --> 13:02.706
trying to figure out what made
your parents tick.

13:02.774 --> 13:04.742
What makes your parents tick?

13:04.809 --> 13:07.178
I...
Exactly.

13:07.245 --> 13:09.780
When you're a kid, they're all
you know. So who knows?

13:09.848 --> 13:11.715
I can tell you this much.

13:11.783 --> 13:16.487
All the stuff that people
obsessed about over them,

13:16.555 --> 13:19.390
all the good things people
wrote, all the nasty shit,

13:19.457 --> 13:20.524
all the movies,

13:20.592 --> 13:23.394
the insider tell-alls,
none of it captured them.

13:23.461 --> 13:26.063
You least of all.

13:41.213 --> 13:42.780
Lester just called.

13:42.847 --> 13:44.615
I think you know what he said.

13:44.683 --> 13:47.318
You questioned my integrity.
I wanted a second opinion.

13:47.385 --> 13:51.255
I thought that you wanted
to be a journalist,

13:51.323 --> 13:53.457
not a noisemaker.

13:53.525 --> 13:54.825
He's a pig, Hal.

13:54.893 --> 13:56.627
And she's his
willing accomplice.

13:56.695 --> 13:58.128
All the men in
this town are afraid

13:58.196 --> 13:59.463
to write the truth about her

13:59.531 --> 14:02.266
because they don't want
to be labeled anti-feminist.

14:02.334 --> 14:04.335
Well they won't be afraid
to write about her anymore.

14:04.402 --> 14:07.371
Let the Elaine Hammond
pile-on begin.

14:07.439 --> 14:11.942
Your piece runs tomorrow,
first page of the Op-ed.

14:13.578 --> 14:14.979
Lester's running it?

14:15.046 --> 14:17.748
Congratulations, Susan.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.516
You got what you wanted.

14:19.584 --> 14:21.952
I hope you're ready for it.

14:39.271 --> 14:43.274
I have no idea where
these hands came from.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.442
Not my hands.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.878
Mine are Pa's.

14:47.946 --> 14:52.283
They're not your mother's
either.

14:52.350 --> 14:55.386
I'm not sure who they belong to.

14:59.357 --> 15:04.728
I remember that first year in
the White House was

15:04.796 --> 15:07.731
the worst year of my life.

15:07.799 --> 15:12.403
Everything I always dreamed of,

15:12.470 --> 15:15.205
the job I'd coveted
ever since I was a young man,

15:15.273 --> 15:16.907
I finally had it.

15:16.975 --> 15:21.178
And I was miserable as hell.

15:21.246 --> 15:23.147
A fourth of my term had passed

15:23.214 --> 15:27.318
and I hadn't accomplished
a single thing

15:27.385 --> 15:29.253
that I'd set out to do.

15:29.321 --> 15:31.455
And I used to walk
the halls at night,

15:31.523 --> 15:35.592
stare up at the faces
of my predecessors

15:35.660 --> 15:39.196
and think to myself,
"Every one of them is

15:39.264 --> 15:42.066
a better man than me."

15:43.468 --> 15:47.237
And then one night,
out of the East Room...

15:50.542 --> 15:53.811
I hear this most glorious sound.

15:53.878 --> 15:57.915
I poke my head in,
and there you are,

15:57.982 --> 15:59.316
eight years old, playing

15:59.384 --> 16:03.587
some kind of classical piece
so effortlessly.

16:03.655 --> 16:05.689
You turned around
when you heard me,

16:05.757 --> 16:07.291
and you let out a crazy laugh,

16:07.359 --> 16:10.894
and you went skipping off
down the hallway.

16:13.231 --> 16:18.602
And after that, I used to hide
around the corner

16:18.670 --> 16:21.572
from the East Room just
to listen to you play.

16:21.639 --> 16:24.274
It was something so simple,

16:24.342 --> 16:27.077
but it brought me
so much peace.

16:30.081 --> 16:32.816
I don't know why
I never told you that.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.928
These hands.

16:44.996 --> 16:46.196
They're not my hands, T.J.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.166
They're yours.

17:01.031 --> 17:06.301
"You do not come spying in our
backyard and make threats."

17:08.038 --> 17:10.506
It's tempting to soft-pedal,

17:10.574 --> 17:13.108
but speeches don't come
bolder than this.

17:13.175 --> 17:16.011
And your words should
match it, sir.

17:20.617 --> 17:22.351
History will judge me by this.

17:22.419 --> 17:25.887
If this goes south,
my entire presidency just...

17:25.955 --> 17:26.989
melts away.

17:27.057 --> 17:30.693
If it goes well,
you'll be a hero...

17:30.760 --> 17:32.962
and you'll be unbeatable.

17:33.029 --> 17:36.432
Either way, it's the right
thing to do, Mr. President.

17:38.902 --> 17:40.302
You know, Elaine...

17:40.370 --> 17:42.004
Thank you.

17:42.072 --> 17:44.039
...this moment, this is why

17:44.107 --> 17:46.842
I asked you to run with me
in the first place.

17:46.910 --> 17:48.510
You wouldn't have been elected.

17:48.578 --> 17:50.479
You needed the
conservative votes

17:50.547 --> 17:54.283
in our party,
which Collier brought.

17:54.351 --> 17:56.852
Good luck, Mr. President.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.220
Thank you.

17:58.288 --> 17:59.955
Ten seconds, sir.

18:06.730 --> 18:08.564
In five,

18:08.632 --> 18:11.233
four, three...

18:14.271 --> 18:16.772
My fellow Americans,

18:16.840 --> 18:20.409
as many of you know, a Chinese
nuclear submarine lies

18:20.477 --> 18:23.312
13 miles off the coast
of Southern California.

18:23.380 --> 18:26.849
As of last night, on my orders,

18:26.917 --> 18:28.784
a Navy salvage group is headed
there to rescue

18:28.852 --> 18:31.320
the 100 Chinese sailors aboard.

18:31.388 --> 18:36.959
However, we have since learned
that the crew were given orders

18:37.027 --> 18:38.327
to destroy their own ship;

18:38.395 --> 18:40.496
and the released radiation
would wreak havoc

18:40.563 --> 18:42.398
upon the entire Western
seaboard.

18:42.465 --> 18:45.601
Let me be clear,

18:45.669 --> 18:47.703
we would consider it
nothing less

18:47.771 --> 18:50.239
than an act of war against
the United States.

18:50.307 --> 18:54.009
You do not come spying in
our backyard and make threats.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.213
<i>When I was your age,</i>

18:58.281 --> 19:00.149
I was the original
girl gone wild.

19:00.216 --> 19:02.551
Dancing on tabletops

19:02.619 --> 19:04.420
in clubs all over town.

19:04.487 --> 19:05.921
Why did you settle down?

19:05.989 --> 19:08.791
It was my second husband.

19:08.858 --> 19:10.225
It was Elaine's stepfather,

19:10.293 --> 19:12.194
Dale Barrish.

19:12.262 --> 19:16.065
He treated me like a queen,
but he was just boring as shit.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.567
You didn't love him?

19:18.635 --> 19:21.070
Well, there's all kinds of love,
isn't there?

19:21.137 --> 19:23.706
I mean, I loved his kindness

19:23.773 --> 19:27.242
and I loved what he did
for Elaine...

19:27.310 --> 19:29.812
He taught her the preamble
to the Constitution

19:29.879 --> 19:33.048
before she was five.

19:33.116 --> 19:35.651
He just saw abilities in her

19:35.719 --> 19:38.821
that I just wasn't capable
of seeing.

19:38.888 --> 19:42.091
But it just wasn't
the head-over-heels love

19:42.158 --> 19:44.059
kind of thing, you know?

19:48.365 --> 19:51.266
That cushion you're sitting on,
I bet there's a zipper on it.

19:51.334 --> 19:52.468
Oh.

19:56.473 --> 19:58.874
Yep, sure does.

20:01.978 --> 20:04.780
That little shit.

20:04.848 --> 20:07.116
<i>Oh, my God, that filet</i>

20:07.183 --> 20:08.751
it could turn vegetarians.

20:08.818 --> 20:11.620
You leaving all that?

20:11.688 --> 20:13.022
Knock yourself out.

20:13.089 --> 20:14.556
Maybe just a little.

20:17.761 --> 20:20.295
Mm-hmm. Really good.

20:20.363 --> 20:21.697
What's so funny?

20:21.765 --> 20:23.966
Watching you down my food.

20:24.034 --> 20:25.367
Annie loves to eat, too.

20:25.435 --> 20:27.069
It's just, uh, well,

20:27.137 --> 20:28.570
now she's gotta worry about...

20:28.638 --> 20:30.305
What, squeezing
into a wedding dress?

20:30.373 --> 20:31.673
Yeah.

20:31.741 --> 20:33.042
Not really on my radar.

20:33.109 --> 20:34.543
So you and your boyfriend...?

20:34.611 --> 20:35.744
Split up.

20:35.812 --> 20:38.680
He's back to being
just my editor now.

20:40.250 --> 20:41.583
So...

20:41.651 --> 20:43.218
tell me more about Anne.

20:43.286 --> 20:45.154
Like what?

20:45.221 --> 20:47.990
Well, your fiancée is about
to become a Hammond.

20:48.058 --> 20:50.159
What do you think
after having been

20:50.226 --> 20:52.461
under that magnifying glass
your whole life?

20:52.529 --> 20:54.630
It must be tough to be
a journalist sometimes,

20:54.697 --> 20:57.299
acting like you're someone's
friend one minute,

20:57.367 --> 20:59.468
and the next you've got them
over a barrel.

20:59.536 --> 21:01.603
Oh, you put yourself over
that barrel.

21:01.671 --> 21:03.105
Do you ever stop playing people?

21:03.173 --> 21:04.840
You're talking to me
about playing people?

21:04.908 --> 21:06.341
Your mother lied to my face,

21:06.409 --> 21:07.810
said she wasn't running
for president.

21:07.877 --> 21:09.578
You know what?
Don't take it so personally.

21:09.646 --> 21:11.780
You've had it out for her
for the last 15 years.

21:11.848 --> 21:13.282
You've made a career out
of trying

21:13.349 --> 21:14.817
to drive her name
into the ground.

21:14.884 --> 21:16.919
And now you're riding her
coattails to the White House.

21:16.986 --> 21:18.320
When I became a journalist,

21:18.388 --> 21:20.756
I was taught that my job was
to keep politicians honest.

21:20.824 --> 21:22.925
And who was keeping you honest?

21:22.992 --> 21:26.261
I think it's best if we want
to make it to San Diego

21:26.329 --> 21:28.697
without some sort of
double-homicide situation

21:28.765 --> 21:30.299
to declare your mother
off-limits.

21:32.569 --> 21:36.672
Sure I can't interest either
of you two in a glass of wine?

21:36.739 --> 21:37.973
Sure.
Me, too.

21:38.041 --> 21:41.477
Here, cocaine. Dump it.

21:45.548 --> 21:49.084
These look like they have
little signs on them.

21:49.152 --> 21:50.519
Are those bunnies?

21:50.587 --> 21:52.855
Uh, I think they're unicorns.

21:52.922 --> 21:54.523
Oh. Dump them.

21:59.329 --> 22:00.996
Now, this...

22:01.064 --> 22:03.966
I can think of a more
interesting way to get rid of.

22:04.033 --> 22:05.501
You're joking.

22:05.568 --> 22:08.670
Some of my friends in California
get this from their doctors.

22:08.738 --> 22:11.140
I mean, it can be therapeutic.

22:11.207 --> 22:13.909
All right, I...
I haven't smoked since college.

22:13.977 --> 22:16.311
I'm not doing it now
with my fiancé's grandmother.

22:16.379 --> 22:18.313
You know, sometimes
after the show, somebody

22:18.381 --> 22:20.949
would give us a tip
of a couple of reefers.

22:21.017 --> 22:22.951
Us girls would
stay up all night

22:23.019 --> 22:25.854
drinking, smoking,
sexually experimenting.

22:25.922 --> 22:27.122
This is a terrible idea.

22:27.190 --> 22:29.858
Anne, sweetheart,
you could stand

22:29.926 --> 22:32.895
a couple of terrible ideas.

22:37.133 --> 22:38.500
More wine, sir?

22:38.568 --> 22:41.069
No, thank you.
I think we're all good here.

22:42.605 --> 22:43.705
I have enough trouble

22:43.773 --> 22:45.207
holding my tongue
when I'm sober.

22:45.275 --> 22:46.742
We're off the record.

22:46.809 --> 22:48.577
Say whatever you want.

22:48.645 --> 22:52.214
Listen, the way that I came
at you before-- way out of line.

22:52.282 --> 22:53.649
It's only fair.

22:53.716 --> 22:55.384
I should be able
to take character impeachment

22:55.451 --> 22:56.919
as easily as I give it, right?

22:56.986 --> 22:59.354
Honestly, though,
there was a part of me

22:59.422 --> 23:02.191
that loved some
of what you wrote.

23:02.258 --> 23:04.159
The stuff about my dad--

23:04.227 --> 23:08.230
how it used to drive him
bat-shit crazy.

23:08.298 --> 23:10.899
I campaigned for him
in college, you know?

23:10.967 --> 23:13.068
Drove four hours
to see him speak.

23:13.136 --> 23:14.836
It was one of the most

23:14.904 --> 23:16.905
inspirational moments
of my life.

23:16.973 --> 23:18.640
And you know
what the best part was?

23:18.708 --> 23:20.042
Hmm?
Your mom.

23:20.109 --> 23:22.411
It opened my eyes
that a woman could be

23:22.478 --> 23:25.847
that strong and independent
and still be...

23:25.915 --> 23:28.917
I don't know,
a wife and mother.

23:28.985 --> 23:30.719
What was yours like?
Your mother.

23:31.754 --> 23:34.990
She died a few years ago.

23:35.058 --> 23:36.391
Breast cancer.

23:36.459 --> 23:38.627
Uh... why?

23:38.695 --> 23:41.230
You may know more
about my own mother than I do,

23:41.297 --> 23:43.165
and I don't seem to know
anything about yours.

23:43.233 --> 23:45.300
It just doesn't seem right.

23:45.368 --> 23:48.704
She didn't care
for my columns about your mom.

23:48.771 --> 23:50.038
I thought I was
being principled.

23:50.106 --> 23:51.540
She thought I was just doing it

23:51.608 --> 23:53.942
to set myself apart
from the world.

23:54.010 --> 23:55.644
She may have been right.

23:55.712 --> 23:57.045
I thought
I was being principled

23:57.113 --> 23:59.414
when I told you
about my mother's run.

24:00.783 --> 24:03.619
We all make mistakes.

24:03.686 --> 24:05.320
I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.

24:05.388 --> 24:07.456
We need to make
an emergency stop in Dallas

24:07.523 --> 24:08.657
to wait out some thunderstorms.

24:08.725 --> 24:10.792
But we promise to get you
back in the air

24:10.860 --> 24:12.728
to San Diego
as soon as possible.

24:12.795 --> 24:14.963
Bright side.

24:15.031 --> 24:17.132
We can finish this bottle.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.567
Mmm.

24:20.003 --> 24:22.004
Thank you.

24:27.577 --> 24:30.746
I know it's a shoe box,
but there's lots of glass.

24:30.813 --> 24:32.314
And, uh,
I'm the youngest staffer

24:32.382 --> 24:33.915
with four walls.

24:33.983 --> 24:35.684
Like Virginia Woolf said,

24:35.752 --> 24:38.186
"All a writer needs is
a room of one's own."

24:38.254 --> 24:39.655
Right?

24:39.722 --> 24:42.324
Well, I'm happy
for you, sweetheart.

24:44.227 --> 24:45.527
Are you?

24:45.595 --> 24:49.231
I came here to celebrate
your new office, so I...

24:49.299 --> 24:50.866
Let's not do this.

24:52.368 --> 24:53.702
Mom, please just...

24:53.770 --> 24:55.203
say whatever the hell
you're thinking

24:55.271 --> 24:57.973
so I don't have to spend all
of lunch trying to decipher it.

24:59.008 --> 25:00.776
I'm proud of you.

25:00.843 --> 25:02.678
Uh, you've accomplished
a great deal.

25:02.745 --> 25:03.812
But?

25:03.880 --> 25:06.615
I just don't think
that Elaine Hammond

25:06.683 --> 25:08.884
is the ogre that you present.

25:08.951 --> 25:10.452
No, and it seems naive

25:10.520 --> 25:13.255
that someone still in their 20s,
someone not yet married,

25:13.323 --> 25:15.457
uses the infidelities
of someone's marriage

25:15.525 --> 25:17.526
as a lightning rod.

25:17.593 --> 25:20.395
Now, I think, once you've
learned how much work it takes,

25:20.463 --> 25:21.897
you'll be less...

25:24.767 --> 25:26.134
I am the only woman

25:26.202 --> 25:29.004
with an op-ed column
at this paper.

25:29.072 --> 25:30.339
Yes, well, you'd never know it

25:30.406 --> 25:32.107
by the way
you shred Elaine Hammond.

25:32.175 --> 25:34.609
Do you really hate her
that much, or is she just

25:34.677 --> 25:36.611
an easy mark to get this?

25:37.947 --> 25:40.749
What a spiteful thing to say.

25:40.817 --> 25:42.484
This is resentment.

25:42.552 --> 25:43.819
You cut your career short,

25:43.886 --> 25:46.588
so how dare I become
successful in mine.

25:46.656 --> 25:48.490
No, I left medicine
to have a family.

25:48.558 --> 25:50.058
And if I hadn't done that,

25:50.126 --> 25:52.494
I think it's fairly unlikely
you would be here today.

25:55.765 --> 25:57.532
I'm sorry. I-I...

25:57.600 --> 26:00.402
I didn't come into
town for this.

26:00.470 --> 26:05.107
I came to see you and
to have a nice lunch.

26:05.174 --> 26:06.308
So let's go.

26:06.376 --> 26:08.043
Please.

26:08.111 --> 26:10.846
I'm supposed to
meet Liz at 2:00.

26:12.882 --> 26:15.684
You scheduled a half-hour
for us to eat?

26:15.752 --> 26:17.319
She's painting the townhouse.

26:17.387 --> 26:19.554
She asked me to come
by and take a look.

26:19.622 --> 26:21.723
I mean, second-year residents
can't make their own schedule.

26:25.194 --> 26:26.962
Go eat with Liz.

26:27.029 --> 26:28.363
Talk shop.

26:28.431 --> 26:30.232
Oh, Suse.
No.

26:30.299 --> 26:31.900
Really.

26:33.035 --> 26:34.936
Well, okay.

26:43.306 --> 26:45.841
I wish my mother were here.

26:45.908 --> 26:49.344
She at least would have had
the sense to smuggle in a flask.

26:49.412 --> 26:51.980
Come on. You've done
everything you could, sugar.

26:52.048 --> 26:55.517
Now it's up to God
and the doctors...

26:55.585 --> 26:56.885
and the Chinese,

26:56.953 --> 26:59.187
all of whom-- let's face it--
work in mysterious ways.

26:59.255 --> 27:02.657
I don't think I ever
fully realized until today

27:02.725 --> 27:04.860
how much pressure
you were under.

27:04.927 --> 27:07.329
Well, after spending
the last 12 hours

27:07.396 --> 27:10.732
watching over T.J., I could say
the same thing to you.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.535
He wouldn't be lying here
if we had given

27:13.603 --> 27:16.104
the same devotion and passion
to his well-being

27:16.172 --> 27:18.073
that we gave
to our political careers.

27:18.140 --> 27:20.442
Apples and oranges, sugar.

27:20.510 --> 27:23.044
As soon as he started
to go downhill in high school,

27:23.112 --> 27:25.046
I should have packed up
and left DC.

27:25.114 --> 27:26.715
We've been through this.

27:26.782 --> 27:28.717
No, we made a choice, Bud.

27:28.784 --> 27:31.052
We put our goals
for this country

27:31.120 --> 27:33.688
ahead of the well-being
of our child,

27:33.756 --> 27:35.957
and that is a decision
we have to live with

27:36.025 --> 27:37.425
for the rest of our lives.

27:41.964 --> 27:45.567
Hey, that, uh, congressman,

27:45.635 --> 27:48.670
Sean Reeves, uh, you
got pretty upset

27:48.738 --> 27:50.772
when his name came
up last night.

27:50.840 --> 27:52.908
Is he the one that
changed his vote

27:52.975 --> 27:54.943
on the Child Protection Act?

27:55.011 --> 27:56.745
Right around Christmas,
as I recall.

27:56.812 --> 27:58.747
He and T.J.
were having an affair.

27:58.814 --> 28:00.849
What? Sean ended up going back

28:00.917 --> 28:03.518
to his wife,
and it broke T.J.'s heart.

28:03.586 --> 28:07.155
Someone found out
they were seeing each other

28:07.223 --> 28:10.659
and threatened to out Sean
if he didn't change his vote.

28:10.726 --> 28:12.227
So he did.

28:12.295 --> 28:13.628
Who was it?

28:13.696 --> 28:15.196
A Democrat.

28:15.264 --> 28:18.366
One of our own,
if you can believe that.

28:19.769 --> 28:21.736
Tell me who it was, sugar.

28:21.804 --> 28:24.773
You know, just so if I see him
at a cocktail party,

28:24.840 --> 28:27.409
I can spill a glass
of wine on him.

28:32.014 --> 28:33.748
Okay, hold on a minute.

28:33.816 --> 28:36.651
You actually have
a Backstreet Boys playlist?

28:36.719 --> 28:41.122
Ooh, I don't know
if anybody told you, but, um...

28:42.658 --> 28:45.493
♪ Backstreet's back,
all right. ♪

28:45.561 --> 28:47.228
I still got those dance moves.

28:47.296 --> 28:50.031
I might even have my
tuxedo shorts somewhere.

28:50.099 --> 28:52.534
You should wear them
to your wedding.

28:52.602 --> 28:56.638
Yeah, uh, I don't know if
Annie would like that so much.

28:56.706 --> 28:58.306
She's a designer,

28:58.374 --> 29:01.876
so God forbid that I clash
with the table settings.

29:04.814 --> 29:06.681
Um... I showed you mine.

29:06.749 --> 29:08.717
Now you show me yours.

29:08.784 --> 29:10.018
Hey.

29:10.086 --> 29:12.520
Yeah, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

29:12.588 --> 29:13.989
Uh, let's see.

29:14.056 --> 29:16.524
"Deadline" playlist.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

29:16.592 --> 29:18.159
Um, "Treadmill" playlist.
Mm-hmm.

29:18.227 --> 29:19.661
"Insomnia" playlist.
Yes. Sorry.

29:19.729 --> 29:21.129
That is my life.

29:21.197 --> 29:25.133
Who's Alex, and why does
he get his own playlist?

29:28.037 --> 29:29.337
Your ex.

29:29.405 --> 29:31.706
Sorry.

29:31.774 --> 29:33.708
We were living together,
and, um,

29:33.776 --> 29:37.345
he had an affair
with a woman we both work with,

29:37.413 --> 29:38.947
so I moved out.

29:41.117 --> 29:42.584
I tell you a secret?

29:42.652 --> 29:44.419
I think that you're
a little drunk,

29:44.487 --> 29:45.754
so watch yourself.

29:45.821 --> 29:47.322
Drunk secrets are the best.

29:49.592 --> 29:54.062
I had sex on this plane
the last time I was on it.

29:54.130 --> 29:55.897
With my dad?

29:55.965 --> 29:57.298
Jesus, no.

29:58.601 --> 30:01.302
With another journalist.

30:01.370 --> 30:02.971
I was trying to get over my ex,

30:03.039 --> 30:05.440
but, of course,
it made things worse.

30:08.744 --> 30:11.946
I know she doesn't like me.

30:12.014 --> 30:13.181
Oh...

30:13.249 --> 30:15.050
She's never liked me.

30:15.117 --> 30:18.053
She doesn't think that I
am good enough for her...

30:18.120 --> 30:20.422
precious
prince-of-the-world son.

30:20.489 --> 30:21.856
Do you know
what she talked about

30:21.924 --> 30:23.058
the first time we met?

30:23.125 --> 30:25.026
Hmm?
Douglas's ex-girlfriend.

30:26.362 --> 30:28.630
The Lauren bitch.

30:30.566 --> 30:32.934
"Lauren's a Rhodes Scholar."

30:34.303 --> 30:35.637
No wonder she loved her.

30:35.705 --> 30:37.505
She was a carbon copy of her.

30:37.573 --> 30:40.975
You know, I like this Anne--
she's my kind of gal.

30:41.043 --> 30:43.144
You ought to let her
out more often.

30:44.513 --> 30:45.747
Mmm.

30:45.815 --> 30:47.082
And the phone calls.

30:47.149 --> 30:49.184
She calls him
at 3:00 in the morning

30:49.251 --> 30:50.285
just to chat.

30:50.352 --> 30:51.619
They don't think it's weird.

30:51.687 --> 30:54.155
I mean, I don't care
where they work.

30:54.223 --> 30:55.690
That's weird.

30:55.758 --> 30:57.292
Well, now,
don't get carried away.

30:57.359 --> 30:59.494
That's my grandson
you're talking about.

30:59.562 --> 31:03.431
She will always be
number one on his speed dial.

31:03.499 --> 31:05.834
I'll have to live
with being number two.

31:05.901 --> 31:07.769
No, absolutely not.

31:07.837 --> 31:09.370
You can't settle for that.

31:09.438 --> 31:10.638
Are you kidding me?

31:10.706 --> 31:12.874
You got to say to him,
"I am number one."

31:12.942 --> 31:14.843
Now, say that.

31:14.910 --> 31:16.644
I'm number one.

31:16.712 --> 31:18.046
No, louder.

31:18.114 --> 31:20.181
And stick your boobs
out when you say it.

31:20.249 --> 31:22.484
"I am number one."

31:24.253 --> 31:25.587
I am number one.

31:25.654 --> 31:26.855
There you go.

31:26.922 --> 31:28.323
There's hope for you yet.

31:29.859 --> 31:32.327
Now, will you please stop
bogarting that thing?

31:37.199 --> 31:38.666
<i>Ah.</i>

31:38.734 --> 31:41.603
Nice to see you've redecorated.

31:41.670 --> 31:43.338
President Turner was one

31:43.405 --> 31:45.774
tasteless son of a bitch.

31:45.841 --> 31:48.443
Plus, he tore out
my bowling alley.

31:48.511 --> 31:52.046
Never trust anyone
who doesn't enjoy bowling.

31:52.114 --> 31:53.515
How are you, Mr. President?

31:53.582 --> 31:54.949
Mr. President.

31:55.017 --> 31:56.317
Welcome home.

31:56.385 --> 31:58.253
Thank you.
Have a seat, please.

31:58.320 --> 32:00.155
Thanks for setting
this up, Fred,

32:00.222 --> 32:02.290
on such short notice.
Sure.

32:02.358 --> 32:03.992
Listen, Bud,
I should probably tell you

32:04.059 --> 32:05.860
before you even get started--

32:05.928 --> 32:07.195
whatever information or insight

32:07.263 --> 32:08.897
you have into our
current situation,

32:08.964 --> 32:10.532
it's not likely
to change my mind.

32:10.599 --> 32:12.100
About the Chinese sub?

32:12.168 --> 32:13.434
Go rescue it.

32:13.502 --> 32:15.703
It's what I'd do
if I were still in the chair.

32:15.771 --> 32:17.505
You said you had intel.

32:17.573 --> 32:20.175
I do, Fred, and it's important.

32:20.242 --> 32:21.910
You'll see.

32:21.977 --> 32:25.480
Generally speaking, Paul,
and with all due respect,

32:25.548 --> 32:28.583
I think you're slick,
uncommitted

32:28.651 --> 32:29.818
and opportunistic.

32:29.885 --> 32:31.152
You lack the backbone

32:31.220 --> 32:32.654
to be a great leader,

32:32.721 --> 32:34.889
but you're not
without your principles.

32:34.957 --> 32:37.659
I guess this is the part
where I say, "Thank you, Bud."

32:37.726 --> 32:39.194
Old Fred here,
on the other hand,

32:39.261 --> 32:40.595
well, I'll be damned

32:40.663 --> 32:42.664
if I know what makes him tick.

32:42.731 --> 32:43.998
Then again,

32:44.066 --> 32:45.967
having run the CIA
as long as you did,

32:46.035 --> 32:47.569
I guess any sort of principles,

32:47.636 --> 32:52.507
any kind of human compunction,
would just get in the way.

32:52.575 --> 32:54.142
You have any idea
what I was doing

32:54.210 --> 32:56.277
while you were dodging the draft
in the Coast Guard?

32:56.345 --> 32:58.713
I served this country

32:58.781 --> 33:00.582
with honor
for over three decades.

33:00.649 --> 33:04.219
You wouldn't know honor
if it sucked your cock

33:04.286 --> 33:07.522
and stroked your balls, Fred.
That's a beautiful metaphor.

33:07.590 --> 33:09.591
Bud, why don't you tell me
what's on your mind?

33:09.658 --> 33:11.993
The Child Protection Act.

33:13.162 --> 33:15.630
Last December,

33:15.698 --> 33:18.166
when you were teaching
your boy to ski,

33:18.234 --> 33:20.635
he turned
Congressman Sean Reeves

33:20.703 --> 33:23.905
by threatening to disclose
the man's sexual orientation,

33:23.973 --> 33:26.441
which is not
as publicly advertised.

33:27.943 --> 33:30.245
Just fell in our laps.

33:30.312 --> 33:32.347
Well, would you
swear that on oath

33:32.414 --> 33:35.250
before a House
Oversight Committee?

33:35.317 --> 33:37.552
He used your name,
Mr. President.

33:37.620 --> 33:41.522
He told folks that the scheme
was your redheaded stepchi.

33:41.590 --> 33:45.293
He's just pissed
because his queer son

33:45.361 --> 33:47.328
was having an affair
with Reeves.

33:47.396 --> 33:50.865
Or were you going to just leave
that part out, Mr. President?

33:50.933 --> 33:53.334
No, I was getting there.
Yeah.

33:53.402 --> 33:55.436
But I wanted to do this first.

33:58.474 --> 34:00.141
You son of a bitch!

34:00.209 --> 34:02.277
I'll kick your...
Fred.

34:02.344 --> 34:04.279
Bud. Jesus.

34:04.346 --> 34:06.481
Son of a bitch! Guys, that's it.
That's enough.

34:06.548 --> 34:08.750
That's enough! Bud.

34:12.655 --> 34:14.822
You harm my family again,

34:14.889 --> 34:17.225
and I swear to
ever-loving God

34:17.293 --> 34:19.827
I will wipe your existence
from the face of this Earth.

34:23.966 --> 34:27.034
Probably ought to get
some ice on that.

34:31.800 --> 34:32.833
<i>Drunk secret.</i>

34:32.900 --> 34:34.435
I, uh...

34:34.503 --> 34:39.540
proposed to Anne while
we were on Ecstasy.

34:39.608 --> 34:40.975
Okay.

34:41.042 --> 34:43.610
That beats joining
the mile-high club.

34:43.678 --> 34:47.614
And we've been planning
our wedding for two years

34:47.681 --> 34:49.617
because I'm not really sure

34:49.684 --> 34:51.685
either one of us
is ready to commit.

34:51.753 --> 34:53.654
Do you love her?

34:56.190 --> 34:58.058
Yeah, totally.

34:58.126 --> 34:59.660
But...?

35:02.464 --> 35:05.332
It's like... it's
like you put on

35:05.400 --> 35:09.537
this, um, expensive,
tailored suit,

35:09.604 --> 35:14.008
right, and everybody tells
you how great you look in it,

35:14.075 --> 35:18.012
but it doesn't really
fit quite right

35:18.079 --> 35:20.714
unless you stand
perfectly still.

35:23.251 --> 35:25.719
Love has never fit
quite right for me.

35:25.787 --> 35:27.955
I was always certain
about my job--

35:28.023 --> 35:30.558
maybe too certain--
but not with love.

35:30.625 --> 35:33.093
You never settled, you know?

35:33.161 --> 35:34.495
That-that takes courage.

35:34.563 --> 35:38.132
You have never compromised
in your writing, so why

35:38.200 --> 35:39.967
should you compromise
in your personal life?

35:40.035 --> 35:41.836
There's a flip side
no one tells you about.

35:41.903 --> 35:43.137
Oh.

35:43.205 --> 35:46.006
You wake up one day...

35:46.074 --> 35:48.175
and you realize
that while you were busy

35:48.243 --> 35:50.644
being brazen,
making a name for yourself,

35:50.712 --> 35:53.247
everyone made a life.

35:53.315 --> 35:55.783
And then you're not
uncompromising;

35:55.851 --> 35:57.852
you're just sad.

35:57.919 --> 35:59.253
Bullshit.

36:00.789 --> 36:05.726
You... are gorgeous.

36:05.794 --> 36:07.828
You're smart.
You are...

36:07.896 --> 36:09.330
A bitch who makes a living

36:09.397 --> 36:11.866
ripping other people's lives
to shreds in public?

36:11.933 --> 36:13.901
Yes.

36:14.936 --> 36:17.505
And...

36:17.572 --> 36:19.607
sexy.

36:22.043 --> 36:24.378
I-I wish that I had
some of your courage.

36:25.680 --> 36:28.115
Look at you, Douglas.

36:28.183 --> 36:31.185
You're the youngest
chief of staff in State...

36:46.968 --> 36:48.469
Wait.

37:44.259 --> 37:46.427
Mom.

37:49.130 --> 37:51.165
Oh, sweetie.

37:55.003 --> 37:56.804
Where... where am I?

37:56.871 --> 37:59.239
Oh. You're in the hospital.

38:00.976 --> 38:02.543
Oh, my God.

38:02.611 --> 38:04.979
I'm so sorry.

38:05.046 --> 38:06.580
I-I didn't mean
for this to happen.

38:06.648 --> 38:08.682
I wasn't... I wasn't trying
to hurt myself.

38:08.750 --> 38:10.184
Don't worry about any of that.

38:10.251 --> 38:12.319
Shh. Go back to sleep.

38:12.387 --> 38:15.155
It's all going to be okay.

38:20.061 --> 38:21.962
Shh.

38:24.032 --> 38:25.499
How is he?

38:26.868 --> 38:28.235
What happened to you?

38:28.303 --> 38:29.536
Oh, nothing.

38:29.604 --> 38:31.338
He just woke up for a second.

38:31.406 --> 38:33.073
Right.

38:33.141 --> 38:34.742
I'll stay with him now.

38:34.809 --> 38:36.844
You need to get back
to the Situation Room.

38:36.911 --> 38:39.146
Won't be long before they
make contact with that sub.

38:39.214 --> 38:41.081
You know, it's freezing in here.

38:41.149 --> 38:43.517
They either need to bring
him another blanket

38:43.585 --> 38:45.252
or turn up the temperature.
Right, right.

38:45.320 --> 38:46.787
And ask the nurses
to have something

38:46.855 --> 38:48.989
for him to eat
when he wakes up, you know?

38:49.057 --> 38:51.058
Yeah. He needs to get
some solid food in him.

38:51.126 --> 38:53.027
That's all right.
Just leave him with me.

38:53.094 --> 38:55.195
Now, go. Go on.

39:32.434 --> 39:34.401
Now, most people,
when they get high,

39:34.469 --> 39:36.203
they get the munchies.

39:36.271 --> 39:37.371
I get the drunkies.

39:37.439 --> 39:39.006
No, no, I didn't mean
to say that.

39:39.074 --> 39:40.307
That was wrong.

39:40.375 --> 39:41.909
I get the drinkies.

39:48.416 --> 39:50.918
Okay, what exactly is this?

39:50.985 --> 39:52.186
It's delicious.

39:52.253 --> 39:53.654
It's Turkish delight.

39:53.722 --> 39:55.756
The Turkish ambassador
sent it over.

39:55.824 --> 39:57.925
He's got a crush on Elaine.

39:57.992 --> 40:00.794
It's a little on the
nose if you ask me.

40:05.066 --> 40:07.034
Don't do it, honey.

40:07.102 --> 40:10.404
Don't do it to
yourself anymore.

40:10.472 --> 40:12.606
I'm just using the bathroom.

40:12.674 --> 40:14.708
Hey, who you
talking to? Huh?

40:14.776 --> 40:16.076
I was a showgirl.

40:16.144 --> 40:18.145
You think I don't know
what some of the girls

40:18.213 --> 40:20.481
had to do to fit into
our skimpy costumes?

40:20.548 --> 40:22.116
You think I don't notice you

40:22.183 --> 40:23.951
getting up halfway
through every meal

40:24.018 --> 40:26.186
and coming back from the
ladies' room light-headed

40:26.254 --> 40:29.022
and reeking of breath mints?

40:29.090 --> 40:31.225
There's a lot of
looking the other way

40:31.292 --> 40:34.294
in this family,
babe, but not by me.

40:35.864 --> 40:38.565
I think there's been some kind
of misunderstanding.

40:38.633 --> 40:40.701
Okay.

40:40.769 --> 40:43.103
You don't have to
come clean to me,

40:43.171 --> 40:45.072
but you got to talk
to Dougie about it.

40:45.140 --> 40:47.941
You know, let him
get you some help.

40:56.651 --> 40:58.685
The waiting's almost over now.

40:58.753 --> 41:01.121
It's not just the lives
of our Navy divers

41:01.189 --> 41:02.689
and the Chinese crew.

41:02.757 --> 41:04.858
I think we all know
what's at stake here.

41:06.194 --> 41:07.628
Unit One,

41:07.695 --> 41:09.630
you're clear for attach.

41:09.697 --> 41:11.398
Repeat-- clear for attach.

41:11.466 --> 41:14.835
Approaching
with cable number one.

41:14.903 --> 41:17.504
Ten meters and closing.

41:19.808 --> 41:22.009
Five meters.

41:23.444 --> 41:25.445
Three.

41:26.481 --> 41:28.482
Two.

41:29.517 --> 41:31.885
One.

41:31.953 --> 41:34.855
Cable one attached, Topside.

41:36.825 --> 41:39.693
Cable two attached.

41:39.761 --> 41:41.295
Command, this is Topside.

41:41.362 --> 41:42.930
We're getting a pulsed message
from the sub,

41:42.997 --> 41:44.264
but it makes no sense.

41:44.332 --> 41:46.500
Send it through, Topside.

41:48.503 --> 41:51.305
X-I-E-X-I-E.

41:51.372 --> 41:52.906
What is it, code?

41:52.974 --> 41:55.976
It's alphabetized Chinese.

41:56.077 --> 41:58.679
It means, <i>"Xie xie."</i>

41:58.746 --> 42:00.447
"Thank you."

42:00.515 --> 42:01.682
Cable four attached.

42:01.749 --> 42:03.951
All points secure, Topside.

42:04.018 --> 42:06.053
Pull her up.
