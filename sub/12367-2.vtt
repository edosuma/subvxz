- WHEN I TOUCH YOU, I SENSE
EVERY WOMAN IN THE ROOM

09:26.232 --> 09:28.442
WONDERING WHY
I'M NOT TOUCHING HER.

09:28.526 --> 09:32.613
MORE SEX
FOR FUTURE RICK.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.073
AH, SPEAKING OF WHICH.

09:34.156 --> 09:35.324
- HEY, YOU GUYS.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.826
HOW'S MY FAVORITE COUPLE?

09:36.909 --> 09:37.994
- OH, YOU KNOW.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.537
JUST COUPLING OUT.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.998
- OHH.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.165
SO I SPOKE TO
A FRIEND OF MINE AT INS,

09:43.249 --> 09:44.333
AND I THINK
IT'S LOOKING GOOD.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.044
- OH, GOD.
WHAT A RELIEF!

09:47.128 --> 09:49.255
I CAN'T WAIT
FOR THIS TO BE OVER.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.674
THIS ORDEAL, I MEAN.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.427
IT'S BEEN SO HARD
ON ME AND MY...

09:57.054 --> 09:58.681
LORD SHACKLETON.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.016
- WHO?

10:00.099 --> 10:01.642
- IT'S HER
PET NAME FOR ME.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.352
HE WAS CAPTAIN OF THE...

10:03.436 --> 10:05.521
<i>ENDURANCE.</i>

10:05.604 --> 10:06.772
BUT DON'T
WORRY ABOUT ME.

10:06.856 --> 10:11.861
I WOULD GO THROUGH ANYTHING FOR
THE SAKE OF THE WOMAN I LOVE.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.488
- JOY, YOU HAVE GOT QUITE
THE ROMANTIC ON YOUR HANDS.

10:14.572 --> 10:15.865
- AND YOU DON'T
HAVE A DRINK IN YOURS.

10:15.948 --> 10:19.160
SHALL I REMEDY THAT?
- WELL, I WOULD LOVE THAT.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.870
SO CHARMING.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.663
- YES, HE'S FULL OF IT.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.582
CHARM.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.046
- HI.
- HEY.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.172
- HOW'S IT GOING
WITH PETE'S MUM?

10:31.255 --> 10:32.214
- OH, SHE HATES ME.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.841
BUT SHE HATES
EVERYONE FROM L.A.

10:33.924 --> 10:35.509
THINKS WE'RE ALL GOLD DIGGERS.
- HM.

10:35.593 --> 10:40.973
FORTUNATELY, HERE'S VICTORIA
TO PUT HER FEARS TO REST.

10:41.057 --> 10:45.519
- HURRY UP, OSCAR.
HE'S NOT GETTING ANY LIGHTER.

10:47.271 --> 10:52.735
ALL RIGHT, MY CAPTAIN.
WE HAVE ARRIVED.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.613
JUST GO PARK HIM
OVER THERE.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.286
- YOU CARRIED THAT
HELPLESS OLD MAN IN.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.414
- I MEAN, SERIOUSLY.
HE'S, LIKE, 110.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.751
- OH, PLEASE.
THAT'S NOT FOR MONTHS.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.419
SO HOW IS IT GOING
WITH PETE'S MOM?

11:10.503 --> 11:11.837
WHICH ONE IS SHE?

11:11.921 --> 11:14.298
- SHE'S THE ONE OVER THERE
WITH A STICK UP HER ASS.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.008
FATHER NED.

11:19.553 --> 11:20.805
- ELKA?

11:20.888 --> 11:22.556
- ELKA!
THIS IS PERFECT.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.266
YOU CAN HELP ME
WITH PETE'S MOM.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.768
YOU'RE POLISH.
SHE'S POLISH.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.269
YOU CAN KISS UP
TO HER IN POLISH.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.979
STAY RIGHT HERE.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.732
- I THOUGHT THAT
YOU WEREN'T COMING.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.819
- WELL, I RAN OUT OF VODKA.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.405
AND I THOUGHT I WOULD COME OVER
HERE AND FRESHEN UP MY DRUNK.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.656
- HMM.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.116
- WE HAD A FULL BOTTLE.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.451
- I SPILLED SOME.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.911
IN MY MOUTH.

11:43.994 --> 11:48.416
[chuckles]

11:48.499 --> 11:50.584
OH, TOO SLOW.

11:50.668 --> 11:55.756
- JOY, COME MEET MY BOYFRIEND.
BUT HANDS OFF, HE'S BRITTLE.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.007
- ELKA, ELKA.

11:57.091 --> 12:00.678
MRS. SZYMBORSKA, I WOULD LIKE
YOU TO MEET A FRIEND OF MINE.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.847
THIS IS ELKA OSTROVSKY.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.682
ALSO POLISH.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.435
- SO YOU THINK BECAUSE
WE'RE BOTH FROM POLAND

12:07.518 --> 12:08.811
WE'RE GOING
TO LIKE EACH OTHER.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.354
- YEAH, WELL...KINDA.
HEH HEH.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.398
SAY SOMETHING NICE.

12:12.481 --> 12:16.152
- [speaking Polish]

12:19.029 --> 12:23.367
- AND THAT GOES
DOUBLE FOR ME.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.703
- OOH, I THINK
THAT'S FOR ME.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.998
- OH, MY GOD.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.167
JOY, LOOK
WHO JUST WALKED IN.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.335
- WELL, I RAN OUT
OF VODKA AT THE HOUSE.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.714
- NO, WE ALREADY KNOW THAT.
NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT HIM.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.133
- IT'S HANK.
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

12:39.216 --> 12:42.636
- HE LOOKS
ALL RIGHT TO ME.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.472
- NO, HANK'S THE PLUMBER
MELANIE SLEPT WITH

12:44.555 --> 12:45.514
THE FIRST DAY
WE WERE HERE.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.600
- YEAH, THE ONE WHO
TURNED OUT TO BE MARRIED.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.517
NOW, WE'VE GOTTA
WARN MELANIE.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.978
- BUT SHE'S WITH PETE.

12:51.061 --> 12:52.897
- WELL, I GUESS OUR ONLY
CHOICE IS TO JUST STAY HERE

12:52.980 --> 12:55.274
AND STARE AT HANK.

12:55.357 --> 12:59.153
AND IMAGINE WHAT
HE LOOKS LIKE NAKED.

12:59.236 --> 13:03.365
- I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.245
- FINALLY, HENRY'S HERE!
- MAMA.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.288
both: MWAH, MWAH!

13:09.371 --> 13:10.956
- HANK!
HEY, BRO.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.089
- HA, HA, HA!
HANK...

13:19.173 --> 13:20.508
IS YOUR BROTHER?

13:20.591 --> 13:21.884
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.344
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS FOREVER.

13:23.427 --> 13:26.430
"SECOND-HAND PETE" NO MORE.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.232
- HANK, SAY HELLO
TO MY GIRLFRIEND, MELANIE.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.733
- NICE TO MEET YOU, MELANIE.

13:37.816 --> 13:40.236
- YES, LIKEWISE.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.237
HANK, WAS IT?

13:41.320 --> 13:43.072
- YEAH.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.573
- HONEY, WOULD YOU
FRESHEN MY DRINK?

13:44.657 --> 13:47.576
- IT'S FULL.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.080
- BUT IT'S NOT FRESH.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.249
- HANK, OKAY, LISTEN.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.209
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
LET'S AGREE.

13:55.292 --> 13:57.086
IT NEVER HAPPENED.
WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.212
WE'RE COMPLETE STRANGERS.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.089
- MY GOD, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.800
- YOU'RE MARRIED,
I'M DATING YOUR BROTHER.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.260
WHY WOULD YOU
SAY THAT?

14:04.343 --> 14:05.886
- BECAUSE I HAVE NOT STOPPED
THINKING ABOUT YOU

14:05.970 --> 14:06.762
SINCE THAT NIGHT
ON THE BOAT.

14:06.845 --> 14:10.099
I KNOW IT'S WRONG,
AND I LOVE MY BROTHER.

14:10.182 --> 14:13.769
BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE WAY I FEEL.

14:13.852 --> 14:16.105
- YEAH, BUT I DON'T
FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT YOU.

14:16.188 --> 14:19.066
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

14:19.149 --> 14:20.901
MEET ME OUTSIDE FOR A KISS.
COME ON.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.904
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

14:23.988 --> 14:24.488
- LOOK, IF YOU DON'T
FEEL ANYTHING, FINE.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.281
I'LL MOVE ON.

14:25.364 --> 14:26.282
BUT IF THERE'S
SO MUCH AS A SPARK,

14:26.365 --> 14:29.910
I'M GONNA KEEP AFTER YOU
'TILL YOU'RE MINE.

14:29.994 --> 14:30.911
- OHH.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.122
OOH!

14:33.205 --> 14:34.999
- WHAT HAPPENED?
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:35.082 --> 14:37.918
- NO, I FEEL LIKE I'M IN ONE OF
VICTORIA'S <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW'S.</i>

14:38.002 --> 14:40.254
- WELL, HONOR SAINT RAVEN DID
HAVE A SITUATION LIKE THIS,

14:40.337 --> 14:43.966
{\an1}BUT IT WASN'T THE SAME BECAUSE
HANK ISN'T A RE-ANIMATED CORPSE.

14:44.049 --> 14:47.511
- LIKE YOUR DATE.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.352
- YOU KNOW,
THE WORST PART IS...

14:55.436 --> 14:57.479
PETE JUST WANTS
TO RUB ME IN HANK'S FACE.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.316
- I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY
DID THAT ON HIS BOAT.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.283
- HANK WANTS ME
TO MEET HIM OUTSIDE,

15:09.366 --> 15:10.951
SO HE CAN KISS ME AND SEE
IF THERE'S STILL A SPARK.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.328
- THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.331
- DO IT, HE'S HOT.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.916
- I AM GONNA DO IT,
BUT NOT BECAUSE HE'S HOT.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.169
BECAUSE HE PROMISED
IF I FELT NOTHING,

15:20.252 --> 15:21.629
THAN HE WOULD JUST
LEAVE ME ALONE.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.006
I WISH I COULD
BURP UP SOME SAUSAGE.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.343
- MM.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.137
- WHAT A BEAUTIFUL RING
YOU GAVE HER.

15:30.220 --> 15:35.392
- WELL, A BEAUTIFUL HAND
DESERVES A BEAUTIFUL RING.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.186
- ELLEN, WOULD YOU
EXCUSE US FOR A MOMENT?

15:37.269 --> 15:39.063
- SURE.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.564
HE'S QUITE A KEEPER.

15:40.648 --> 15:44.026
- OF COURSE, SOME
WILD THINGS CAN'T BE KEPT.

15:46.403 --> 15:47.821
- WILL YOU STOP
FLIRTING WITH OUR LAWYER?

15:47.905 --> 15:49.406
YOU'RE GONNA RUIN
THE WHOLE THING.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.033
- I'M JUST WARMING
HER UP FOR LATER.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.994
- YOU'RE OVERCOOKING HER.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.246
- DON'T BLAME THE FIRE
FOR BEING HOT.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.795
- OKAY, COME ON.
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.338
OKAY, IF I DON'T
FEEL ANYTHING,

16:04.421 --> 16:05.673
YOU PROMISE TO DROP IT,
RIGHT?

16:05.756 --> 16:07.841
- I PROMISE.
- OKAY.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.431
- YEAH, SORRY.
NOTHING.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.225
- HEY, MELANIE.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.976
PLEASE.
- YOU PROMISED, HANK.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.395
- HONEY!
- DON'T CALL ME HONEY.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.897
- HI, HONEY.
- HONEY!

16:21.980 --> 16:23.399
YOU MUST BE HONEY.
[chuckles]

16:23.482 --> 16:25.067
- HI.
- HI.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.527
- WELL, GOOD, YOU WERE ABLE
TO MAKE IT AFTER ALL.

16:26.610 --> 16:27.903
- YEAH.

16:27.986 --> 16:29.071
- UH, MELANIE,
THIS IS MY WIFE LINDA.

16:29.154 --> 16:32.491
LINDA, THIS IS MELANIE.
MELANIE IS PETE'S GIRLFRIEND.

16:32.574 --> 16:35.411
- OH, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- SO NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.246
YEAH, HANK WAS JUST MAKING SURE
THAT I'M THE RIGHT GIRL.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.372
FOR HIS BABY BROTHER.

16:38.455 --> 16:39.915
AND I HOPE NOW
YOU HAVE PROOF.

16:39.998 --> 16:41.959
THAT PETE
IS THE ONLY MAN FOR ME.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.461
- OH, WELL,
PETE'S A GREAT GUY.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.255
SO THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

16:46.338 --> 16:47.256
- YEAH, YEAH.
I'M LUCKY TO HAVE HIM.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.632
- HMM.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.259
- AS YOU TWO ARE
LUCKY TO HAVE EACH OTHER.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.427
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE
AS THE KIDS SAY,

16:51.510 --> 16:52.845
LOVE IS DA BOMB.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.847
DO KIDS STILL SAY THAT?

16:54.930 --> 16:57.266
DISCUSS, GOTTA GO.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.435
- YOUR DATE DOESN'T
LOOK SO HOT.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.936
- OH, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

17:01.019 --> 17:04.231
WINSTON IS AN EXTREMELY
HANDSOME AND DAPPER MAN

17:04.314 --> 17:07.151
WITHOUT ANY
LIVING HEIRS.

17:07.233 --> 17:10.779
- NO, I MEAN,
HE'S NOT LOOKING SO ALIVE.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.781
- [imitating Winston]
OH, I'M JUST A LITTLE TIRED.

17:12.865 --> 17:16.577
OH ELKA, CAN'T YOU SEE
THAT HE JUST NEEDS TO REST?

17:16.660 --> 17:20.289
- I SAW YOUR LIPS MOVE.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.665
{\an1}- [imitating Winston] DARLING,
YOUR FRIEND SMELLS LIKE A STILL.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.917
OH, WINSTON.
YOU BEHAVE YOURSELF.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.628
OOH, DIAMOND ENCRUSTED.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.798
- WHAT'S THIS NOTE?

17:29.882 --> 17:32.926
"ON THE WEBSITE
YOU LOOKED YOUNGER.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.846
TAKE ME HOME."

17:39.516 --> 17:43.103
[all cheering]

17:43.187 --> 17:45.689
- THAT'S MY PETE,
THAT'S MY BOYFRIEND!

17:45.773 --> 17:48.067
- WOW, I SHOULD
PLAY DARTS MORE OFTEN.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.818
- CLIMB DOWN FROM HIM!

17:49.902 --> 17:54.072
YOU'RE NOT AT WORK,
AND HE IS NOT A POLE.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.994
- WELL, ACTUALLY HE IS A POLE.
YOU'RE ALL POLES.

17:59.077 --> 18:01.663
[laughing]

18:01.747 --> 18:03.165
YEAH, NOTHING?

18:03.248 --> 18:04.917
I GIVE UP.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.168
- YOUR BROTHER.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.003
YOU WOULD NOT SEE HIM
WITH A GIRL LIKE THIS.

18:08.086 --> 18:11.340
- NO, YOU KNOW, MOM, HANK'S
HAD A LOT OF THINGS BEFORE ME

18:11.423 --> 18:13.300
AND BETTER THAN ME,
BUT NOT MELANIE.

18:13.383 --> 18:16.970
[tapping glass]
UM, EXCUSE ME, EVERYBODY.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.349
I'D LIKE
TO MAKE A TOAST.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.727
TONIGHT I FEEL LIKE
THE LUCKIEST GUY IN THE WORLD.

18:23.811 --> 18:27.356
HAVING THIS WONDERFUL
WOMAN BY MY SIDE, AND, UH...

18:27.439 --> 18:28.565
WELL...

18:28.649 --> 18:29.566
TO MELANIE.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.485
- WAIT.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.362
BEFORE WE DRINK,

18:33.445 --> 18:37.032
I NEED TO SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT MELANIE TOO.

18:37.115 --> 18:39.034
THE TRUTH IS--
- IS SO OVERRATED.

18:39.117 --> 18:43.247
BOTTOMS-UP, EVERYBODY!
HA, HA!

18:43.330 --> 18:45.249
- I'M SO HAPPY
THAT MY LITTLE BROTHER

18:45.332 --> 18:48.585
HAS MET A WONDERFUL WOMAN
WHO IS CRAZY ABOUT HIM.

18:48.669 --> 18:49.586
TO THEM.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.172
-<i> NOSTROVIA.</i>

18:52.256 --> 18:53.882
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA TELL EVERYONE HOW

18:53.966 --> 18:56.051
YOU TWO HOOKED UP
ON YOUR BOAT

18:56.134 --> 18:57.845
THE FIRST NIGHT
SHE GOT HERE.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.777
- WELL, NOW WE KNOW
THERE ARE 15 WAYS

19:13.861 --> 19:15.571
TO SAY "WHORE" IN POLISH.

19:15.654 --> 19:19.408
- SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.910

"I SLEPT WITH
YOUR BROTHER."

- I AM SO SORRY, MELANIE.

19:27.499 --> 19:28.750
- ELKA, IT'S OKAY.

FOUND OUT EVENTUALLY.

AT A QUICK GREEN CARD.

STILL, BETTER
THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW

19:43.682 --> 19:47.060
THAN THE CLAMMY
HANDS OF THE RICK.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.438
I THINK HE SPRAINED MY FINGER
PULLING THAT RING OFF.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.608
- WELL, YOU TWO LOST MEN.
I LOST MY MIND.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.109
I MEAN,
IF I'D MARRIED HIM,

19:54.192 --> 19:55.485
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
LOOK AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.778
AND WHO AM I

19:56.862 --> 19:59.865
IF I CAN'T LOOK AT MYSELF
IN THE MIRROR?

19:59.948 --> 20:02.618

I SENT IN A SLIGHTLY YOUNGER
PICTURE OF MYSELF.

20:12.502 --> 20:15.797
- A CAVE DRAWING?

20:22.679 --> 20:24.806
- I SIGNED UP WHEN
MY BENDER WAS OVER.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.850
IN FACT, THAT'S
MY SCREEN NAME.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.645
