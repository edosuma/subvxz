WEBVTT

00:14.014 --> 00:17.100
Okay. Keep your eye on the queen, right?

00:17.183 --> 00:20.061
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Eye on the queen. Eye on the queen.

00:20.145 --> 00:23.398
But watch the jacks. Watch the jacks.

00:23.481 --> 00:26.234
'Cause you hit the jack
and you don't come back.

00:29.612 --> 00:32.073
God damn...

00:32.574 --> 00:33.783
-Damn it.
-Want me to go slower?

00:33.867 --> 00:34.868
-Shut up.
-Is that it?

00:34.951 --> 00:36.161
-Yeah?
-Deal the cards.

00:37.495 --> 00:38.705
Can I ask you something?

00:39.622 --> 00:40.623
Shoot.

00:42.167 --> 00:45.462
Are you, like, a hitman
for Homeland Security?

00:46.337 --> 00:47.589
All that Punisher stuff?

00:47.672 --> 00:50.508
That's their name, not mine.
And I don't work for anybody.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.387
Are you kidding me?

00:55.263 --> 00:56.806
So do we have a plan here?

00:57.724 --> 00:59.517
If we're not running, what are we doing?

00:59.601 --> 01:00.977
Just deal the cards.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.064
Come on, come on, come on, come on. Do it.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.066
-All right, just...
-Got it.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.108
Queen.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.952
-It's right...
-Oh, my God.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.580
-You're not seeing it.
-You gotta be kidding me.

01:20.663 --> 01:22.415
-You're not seeing it.
-What do you mean?

01:22.499 --> 01:24.501
-You're cheating.
-Come on. Really?

01:25.085 --> 01:27.170
Everybody knows
that three-card monte's a scam.

01:27.253 --> 01:30.298
But they still come back to the table.

01:30.381 --> 01:33.093
'Cause they think
they can outsmart the game.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.762
Or they need the money.
Every mark has a reason.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.055
Yeah

01:38.181 --> 01:41.267
You think you can beat anybody,
no matter how stacked the deck.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.686
And you're bored.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.313
And you drink too much coffee.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.399
The frustration keeps you playing.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.443
You hardly ever see
girls playing this game, right?

01:50.527 --> 01:52.779
It's always guys, 'cause they want to win.

01:52.862 --> 01:53.947
What's the alternative?

01:54.989 --> 01:58.118
-Be smart. Don't play.
-Yeah.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.580
Seriously, though, what...

02:02.664 --> 02:04.916
What are you planning to do
about our situation here?

02:04.999 --> 02:08.837
I don't know. What is our situation

02:09.879 --> 02:12.924
It all goes back to Konchevsky, right?
The guy who hired us.

02:13.716 --> 02:16.219
I call him for help,
and suddenly there's goons everywhere.

02:16.302 --> 02:19.973
So, I don't know,
maybe he didn't want to pay for the job.

02:20.056 --> 02:22.892
Or he didn't want any witnesses left
to know what he had.

02:27.438 --> 02:28.898
Are you palming the queen?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.817
-Is that what you're doing?
-No. Look.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.402
So, what

02:32.485 --> 02:33.987
Then, they're all jacks.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.198
-You gotta be kidding me.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.908
It's a really simple sleight, actually.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.368
-Yeah?
-Yeah, let me show you.

02:40.451 --> 02:43.454
Look, two cards in one hand, right?

02:43.538 --> 02:44.539
Always the queen.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.625
But you throw the jack.

02:48.751 --> 02:49.669
That's it.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.004
Oh, that pisses me off.

02:51.087 --> 02:52.797
You've just been looking
in the wrong place.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.215
God damn it.

02:54.799 --> 02:58.720
So this Konchevsky,
you said you called him.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.638
Does that mean you know how to find him?

03:00.722 --> 03:03.725
No. But I know he's from here.

03:03.808 --> 03:04.809
Excuse me?

03:04.893 --> 03:06.144
He's from New York.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.564
Some creepy white old guy.
Russian gang dude.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.232
What

03:11.316 --> 03:13.067
Why do you think I tried to run?

03:13.610 --> 03:16.404
God, I couldn't believe when
you brought me here, of all places.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.031
Shit.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.325
That makes things easier.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.577
You're going after him?

03:23.161 --> 03:24.204
Got to.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.541
Do it again.

03:40.428 --> 03:43.097
You can't win, Frank.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.225
See, that's the thing.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.102
Knowing the move won't help you.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.563
If I know you know...

03:54.359 --> 03:55.485
Christ.

03:58.821 --> 04:03.034
Like I said,
the only way to win is to not play.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.955
Yeah, that's not an option.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.335
Just got to make sure we're the dealer.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.475
Oh, hell no.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.727
Oh, hell yeah.

05:52.810 --> 05:56.606
I don't know what you've heard,
but I ain't done nothing to nobody.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.150
Ask around. I'm head-to-toe legit.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.694
That's good, Turk.
But I need to find a Russian.

06:02.528 --> 06:06.324
I know before you found this, uh...
straight and true path you're on,

06:06.407 --> 06:08.576
you used to sell guns to the Russian vory.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.412
I look like the United Nations to you?

06:11.496 --> 06:13.414
Nah, you look like an asshole to me.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.042
Konchevsky. You heard of him?

06:17.877 --> 06:18.878
Mmm-hmm.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.380
I need to meet with him.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.385
Or maybe I make a phone call.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.306
NYPD and National Guard,

06:30.390 --> 06:33.017
they'll have tanks rolling
down Fifth Avenue after your ass, Castle.

06:33.101 --> 06:33.935
Hey.

06:34.852 --> 06:37.939
You make that call,
I kill you before you hang up the phone.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.774
You know I'll do it.

06:45.988 --> 06:49.617
Konchevsky and his crew
work out of Kazan's Gym in Brooklyn.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.327
They are not good people.

06:52.286 --> 06:55.081
You want to take 'em all out,
the gym is the place.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.917
-Why is that?
-None of them are packing in there.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.337
Cops are in and out of their business
all the time.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.548
Fish in a barrel for a guy like you.

07:03.631 --> 07:07.135
Okay. You gotta go see him.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.763
You gotta tell him that you got a guy
who's got what he needs from Chicago.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.850
Nah, man. I ain't going
anywhere near those crazy bastards.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.978
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Turk, there's money in it for ya.

07:18.104 --> 07:21.899
I'm talking about a big payday, Turk.
Big money.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.902
All you gotta do is tell him
that this guy, he's got the photos

07:24.986 --> 07:27.071
and he's got the girl, man. Say it.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.657
You got the photos and the girl.

07:30.324 --> 07:31.826
And he's gonna know what that's about?

07:31.909 --> 07:33.161
Yes, he will.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.788
You set up a safe place,
make the exchange.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.540
I'll let you negotiate the price, yeah?

07:37.623 --> 07:40.084
Give you 10% of whatever you come up with.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.712
Ten? Forget it. Try forty.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.130
How about twenty-five?

07:44.213 --> 07:45.339
My man.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.592
-You good with that?
-I'm great with that.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.927
-All right.
-Shit.

07:50.803 --> 07:54.390
So, what Hustling and shit?

07:55.224 --> 07:58.227
Oh, yeah, Turk. I'm all about that life.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.315
You call me on this number
when you get it all set.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.734
Don't drive angry, now.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.238
Billy?

10:15.197 --> 10:16.198
Billy?

10:17.533 --> 10:19.452
-Billy!

10:20.161 --> 10:22.496
You're safe.

10:23.205 --> 10:24.665
Do you know who I am?

10:25.708 --> 10:27.793
You're... Dumont. You're Dr. Dumont.

10:27.877 --> 10:28.836
Good.

10:38.387 --> 10:40.640
No, don't go back to sleep.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.391
-Don't want to talk about it.
-I understand.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.061
Don't engage the imagery,
just the feelings.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.104
I don't want to feel. I wanna kill it.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.106
All right. Okay, kill what?

10:49.190 --> 10:51.233
I said
I don't wanna talk about it.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.693
Five blue things.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.070
What

10:54.153 --> 10:56.656
Count five blue things in the room.
Tell me what they are.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.783
Okay. The, um, the-the painting.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.826
It's blue. -That's one. What else?

11:00.910 --> 11:02.119
-The book.
-Two.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.538
-The candle.
-Three.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.875
-The walls.
-And?

11:07.958 --> 11:10.336
And your robe is... Your robe.

11:10.419 --> 11:11.420
-Good.
-Yeah.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.924
Remember what we talked about.
Pause when agitated.

11:15.007 --> 11:18.177
Try not to let yourself
instantly react to your impulses.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.720
Why are you doing this?

11:22.181 --> 11:23.474
It's my job, Billy.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.019
So why didn't you call the cops

11:28.562 --> 11:29.772
We both know they're out there.

11:29.855 --> 11:33.901
-We both know they're looking for me. Why?
-Just be here with me. Be in your body.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.076
I don't know why I let you in.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.914
My best answer is that it seemed
like the right thing to do.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.002
You know you could get
in serious trouble, right?

11:53.254 --> 11:54.255
I know.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.641
Could I have some more water, please?

12:08.018 --> 12:09.019
Of course.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.405
Thank you.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.256
You know,

12:37.840 --> 12:41.343
you might be the only person in the world
who gives a shit about me right now.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.564
Hey. Morning.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.359
Hey. What are you doing?

12:58.402 --> 12:59.403
Eh...

13:00.112 --> 13:01.906
I was up late bullshitting with the kid.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.784
-You good?
-Good morning.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.245
You're making yourself at home?

13:08.329 --> 13:11.665
Yes. I mean,
it's a really nice place you have here.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.170
I'm so glad you like it.

13:17.379 --> 13:18.798
What's going on, Madani?

13:21.717 --> 13:23.928
Russo killed the old man.
The stickball guy.

13:24.011 --> 13:26.680
I got there too late,
and he had already ghosted.

13:26.764 --> 13:27.932
Hey, good riddance.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.559
Not going to lose any sleep
over some child molester,

13:30.643 --> 13:31.560
and neither should you.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.480
No, I was there every day,
morning and night,

13:34.563 --> 13:35.731
waiting for him to slip.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.983
And, actually,
he's exactly what he looks like.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.903
Broken, pathetic, most likely crazy.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.572
Uh, you know, I'll finish the coffee.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.367
I'm not sure what difference
that makes, Madani.

13:46.450 --> 13:50.120
Maybe none, but I still have to find a way
to put him behind bars.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.457
What's that gonna do

13:58.337 --> 13:59.338
Uh...

14:00.297 --> 14:02.591
Hey, listen, um...

14:04.301 --> 14:09.765
So it sounds like this whole Billy thing
isn't gonna get resolved any time soon.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.394
So I was just thinking,
you're Homeland, right?

14:15.062 --> 14:18.274
So maybe she could help us
with the Russians.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.109
Like, deport them or something.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.861
Jesus Christ.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.660
What was I thinking?

14:30.494 --> 14:33.289
Pulling you out of whatever new war
you've started and bringing you here?

14:33.372 --> 14:35.416
You are no use to me with Russo, are you?

14:36.166 --> 14:39.378
Are you? And now... Now,
whatever shit you've gotten into,

14:39.461 --> 14:41.922
I have brought it
right back to my doorstep.

14:44.508 --> 14:45.759
Say something, Frank.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.395
I think you should get some sleep.

15:01.817 --> 15:04.570
You have got 24 hours
to get out of New York.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.865
Yeah.

15:08.782 --> 15:11.577
And you better clean this shit up
before you leave.

15:15.789 --> 15:16.957
Yeah.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.377
Wow. She is really messed up, huh?

15:21.086 --> 15:22.504
You got a big mouth, kid.

15:23.547 --> 15:24.965
Gotta watch out for that.

15:28.677 --> 15:29.803
Yahtzee.

16:33.742 --> 16:34.576
Dad.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.038
Mr. Schultz is here.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.086
Thank you, Lemuel.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.929
Better than when I last saw you.

16:55.597 --> 16:58.058
You've never been one
for false speech, Eliza.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.477
No need to start now.

17:02.980 --> 17:07.943
"You are not in the flesh
but in the Spirit,

17:09.153 --> 17:13.240
if so the Spirit of God dwell in you."

17:15.242 --> 17:16.952
You are strong with that.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.039
So very strong.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.001
Some days.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.634
Is there anything I can do?

17:34.053 --> 17:37.264
Everything is being done, thanks to you.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.023
You know...

17:49.068 --> 17:52.529
I've made peace with it all.

17:55.240 --> 18:01.747
The pain, the fear on my husband...
and children's faces.

18:03.123 --> 18:05.125
All of it.

18:10.839 --> 18:12.299
Except for one thing.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.350
This man and the girl,
what they carry...

18:22.768 --> 18:25.187
it must still be addressed.

18:27.564 --> 18:28.649
They are in New York.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.153
New York.

18:34.154 --> 18:37.157
I believe your faith is strong enough
to pass through any storm,

18:38.534 --> 18:40.410
even a return to New York.

18:42.996 --> 18:45.374
-It's an unclean place.
-Hmm.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.672
But you have given me a good man's life.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.093
I will do what needs to be done.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.096
-She's resting.
-Good.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.057
Thank you. Both of you.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.309
It's what we do.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.396
-We look after one another.
-Amen.

19:07.938 --> 19:11.316
If only the rest of the world
could do as much.

19:11.400 --> 19:16.530
But we can rest easy knowing that
if God continues to smile on our path...

19:17.948 --> 19:20.075
that day will soon come.

19:20.659 --> 19:21.660
Yes.

20:07.331 --> 20:11.752
Agent Dinah Madani. Homeland Security.
Down on the ground, punk!

20:12.336 --> 20:16.006
Don't move. Don't even breathe.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.229
No rep, bro!

21:13.563 --> 21:15.065
Only messing, my brother.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.318
Mr. Kazan.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.736
It's been a while, Turk.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.863
I know. I know. I was uptown for a minute.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.407
Way uptown.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.575
Konchevsky around?

21:25.659 --> 21:29.955
I got a line on something from Chicago
he is going to love.

21:30.038 --> 21:32.582
-Chicago?
-Yeah, Chicago.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.626
Windy City, right?

21:34.710 --> 21:38.755
Or is that Detroit? Nah, Chicago.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.340
Shitty pizza.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.177
So is Konchevsky around, or what?

21:45.846 --> 21:47.472
Funny you should ask, Turk.

21:48.473 --> 21:49.808
Konchevsky's dead.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.644
-Someone killed him.

21:52.728 --> 21:53.937
In Chicago.

22:09.911 --> 22:10.912
Billy?

22:11.872 --> 22:13.206
Billy!

22:15.876 --> 22:17.669
I brought you some clothes.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.091
You didn't have to do that.

22:23.675 --> 22:27.095
Well, you need something
till we figure out what to do next.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.391
-I'm not going back.
-We don't have to--

22:31.475 --> 22:34.644
I'm not going back, ever.
They'd have to kill me first.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.150
What? That's the truth.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.445
You don't know.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.447
You don't know how it feels.

22:45.530 --> 22:48.700
To be scared Hurt?

22:50.786 --> 22:53.497
You don't have a monopoly
on those emotions, Billy.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.624
Guess we've all got our shit, huh?

22:58.085 --> 23:01.046
Well, that's not the clinical term,
but yes.

23:01.129 --> 23:04.174
Difference is
whatever's messed you up,

23:05.384 --> 23:07.094
at least you remember it, huh?

23:10.555 --> 23:11.556
Yes.

23:17.896 --> 23:20.607
What is all this shit?
It's a mess in here.

23:20.690 --> 23:23.110
What -I did not.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.654
-So how did it get here?
-I don't know.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.781
You can get pretty much anything
delivered these days.

23:27.864 --> 23:28.865
Delivered?

23:30.242 --> 23:31.243
Here.

23:32.577 --> 23:33.870
I got you something, too.

23:37.499 --> 23:41.795
I figured you weren't into experimenting
with color in your wardrobe, so...

23:43.046 --> 23:44.714
Who paid for this?

23:44.798 --> 23:45.882
Christ.

23:46.800 --> 23:47.801
What is that?

23:49.136 --> 23:51.972
So this lady, she puts you up
at her house, and you steal from her.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.265
That's what you do?

23:53.348 --> 23:55.392
-You're something else.
-Not like she can't afford it.

23:55.475 --> 23:56.685
Have you seen her shoe closet?

23:56.768 --> 23:59.020
What's that gotta do with anything

23:59.104 --> 24:01.148
I don't know. Is she ever
happy about anything?

24:01.231 --> 24:03.275
-For Chrissake. Unbelievable.
-Like, ever?

24:04.067 --> 24:05.193
Is that Lombardi's?

24:05.277 --> 24:06.778
Sausage and mushroom.

24:07.612 --> 24:08.905
Holy shit.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.454
-Well...
-"Well," what?

24:15.537 --> 24:17.164
Well, I don't know. How'd it go?

24:17.247 --> 24:19.332
Shit. God damn it.

24:19.416 --> 24:22.377
Can you... My phone's in my back pocket.
Just grab it for me. Come on.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.714
Hurry up. Come on.

24:26.798 --> 24:29.176
I guess we're gonna find out.
Hit the button.

24:32.596 --> 24:33.513
Yeah?

24:33.597 --> 24:35.015
Hey, it's Turk.

24:35.098 --> 24:39.686
I got in touch with the man of the Eastern
European persuasion you're looking for.

24:39.769 --> 24:41.938
-He's good to meet.
-Yeah

24:43.106 --> 24:46.443
All good. My man wants to get
his hands on what you got.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.695
All right. He give you a price?

24:49.321 --> 24:50.989
Figured you two will work that out.

24:52.824 --> 24:53.825
Where at?

24:57.954 --> 25:00.415
My place. Five o'clock.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.667
I'm taking a risk,
letting you use my crib.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.127
Hope you appreciate that.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.046
Oh, I do, Turk. I surely do.

25:06.630 --> 25:07.547
All good.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.800
You remember to take care
of old Turk, all right?

25:11.593 --> 25:12.761
Hey, you got it.

25:17.599 --> 25:18.808
Sounds pretty sketchy.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.727
The guy's lying through his teeth.

25:22.229 --> 25:26.024
Hey, you know, I've been thinking.
None of the angles add up here.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.108
How so?

25:27.192 --> 25:28.777
-At the bar in Michigan...
-Mm-hmm.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.695
...all those scary people
showed up, like,

25:30.779 --> 25:33.448
ten minutes after I talked
to Konchevsky on the phone.

25:33.532 --> 25:34.407
Yeah?

25:34.491 --> 25:37.661
So why didn't he just show up
and take care of me quietly himself?

25:37.744 --> 25:38.662
Well...

25:38.745 --> 25:42.290
All those guys that showed up?
None of 'em were Russian.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.376
And the guy at the sheriff station?

25:44.459 --> 25:47.128
I don't know what he was,
but he sure wasn't Russian.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.714
You know, I just...
I keep turning it all over in my head,

25:49.798 --> 25:51.550
and I keep coming up
with the same conclusion.

25:52.342 --> 25:53.885
You think Konchevsky's dead, huh?

25:54.553 --> 25:58.098
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

25:58.181 --> 26:01.226
-So, then, it's a trap?
-It might be.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.896
-And you're still going?
-Yes, I am.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.273
It'll be my trap.

26:08.024 --> 26:09.985
At least I know it's coming, right?

26:21.538 --> 26:24.749
-How long?

26:28.837 --> 26:30.589
Not long, I promise.

26:31.756 --> 26:34.009
I told Eliza today that I'm at ease.

26:35.343 --> 26:37.846
All of it. Except...

26:38.680 --> 26:42.017
And I know this is prideful and selfish.

26:43.518 --> 26:46.146
I want the last thing I see
in this world to be you.

26:56.364 --> 26:57.824
I have obligations.

26:57.907 --> 26:59.326
"To whom much is given..."

26:59.409 --> 27:02.037
Yeah, I know.
"Much is required." I...

27:03.371 --> 27:04.456
My love...

27:05.624 --> 27:07.834
if you do this task quickly,

27:08.668 --> 27:10.503
if you stay strong in your faith,

27:12.047 --> 27:14.591
I promise I will be here waiting
when you return.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.734
No one cares about being on time
or keeping their desks neat or anything.

27:32.817 --> 27:36.946
Nothing matters. It's all bullshit people,
one bullshit day after the next.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.531
I understand that.

27:38.615 --> 27:43.703
Compared to the military,
real life can be sloppy, in its way.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.248
I can't handle anything.

27:47.791 --> 27:48.792
Mmm.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.543
You seem upset, Jake.

27:51.211 --> 27:53.380
Where are you feeling that, in your body?

27:53.463 --> 27:54.589
My stomach.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.342
What does it feel like?

27:57.425 --> 27:59.678
A monster eating my guts.

28:01.304 --> 28:03.181
Are you still drinking, Jake?

28:04.849 --> 28:06.935
One place I'm welcomed is McFeeny's.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.188
What's with the snakes?

28:10.897 --> 28:13.066
Well, that is the rod of Asclepius.

28:13.149 --> 28:16.361
Asclepius was a healer.
The greatest there was.

28:17.070 --> 28:21.616
But the gods were the only ones allowed
to have dominion over life and death,

28:21.700 --> 28:22.992
so they killed him for it.

28:23.827 --> 28:27.288
The snake is thought to represent
the rebirth of healing.

28:27.914 --> 28:29.958
Like the snake shedding its skin,

28:30.041 --> 28:33.002
the sick are transformed
by the healer's art.

28:34.421 --> 28:36.297
That what you think's
happening here?

28:37.757 --> 28:41.010
I'm being... transformed?

28:41.928 --> 28:48.852
How you heal depends on how you accept
this painful, world-shattering change.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.438
It's not easy.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.399
But you have the tools.

28:55.316 --> 28:57.318
Are you still going to your support group?

28:58.153 --> 28:59.154
Yep.

29:00.321 --> 29:01.740
Straight after this.

29:03.199 --> 29:04.868
I know it feels like it,

29:04.951 --> 29:07.537
but you are not the only person
dealing with this.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.514
You a little nervous, Mr. Hoyle?

29:28.641 --> 29:31.144
No, just careful.

29:31.978 --> 29:33.772
It's a crazy city, you know?

29:33.855 --> 29:35.523
Yeah, I know.

29:37.817 --> 29:41.404
Uh, Dinah Madani. Homeland Security.

29:42.071 --> 29:44.449
Feels like I know you already,
even though we never met.

29:44.532 --> 29:46.576
Yeah, well, the same guy
who shot you, shot me.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.080
We got a few people in common, I guess.

29:51.790 --> 29:52.874
Billy Russo.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.335
And, uh, Frank Castle.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.177
Have you...
Have you heard from him lately?

30:04.928 --> 30:08.264
Nah. He's not much of a guy for postcards.

30:08.348 --> 30:09.516
You?

30:10.099 --> 30:11.142
No.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.190
What brings you down here?

30:19.484 --> 30:23.530
Uh... To be honest, I'm desperate.

30:24.197 --> 30:26.324
Turning over any stones I can find.

30:26.407 --> 30:28.243
You sure you want to see
what's underneath 'em?

30:28.326 --> 30:31.496
Look, I--

30:31.579 --> 30:32.705
Are we still meeting?

30:32.789 --> 30:35.208
Yeah. Yeah, just grab some coffee.
We'll start in a sec.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.043
Look, I'm sorry.
We're gonna have to do this--

30:37.126 --> 30:38.628
Look, it'll only take a few minutes.

30:40.046 --> 30:43.007
Look, if I make them wait for you,

30:43.091 --> 30:45.343
then I'm making them feel
like they don't matter.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.847
And that's pretty much
how these guys feel 24/7.

30:49.472 --> 30:51.015
I'm not gonna do that.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.726
So, if you wanna talk,
catch me after the meeting.

30:56.604 --> 30:59.774
Or better yet, how about you sit in?

30:59.858 --> 31:01.025
Who knows?

31:02.777 --> 31:04.487
You might get something from it.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.868
High school sucked.

31:09.951 --> 31:13.955
You know, my dad was, um... is...

31:14.706 --> 31:17.959
Whatever... An asshole.
You know what I mean?

31:18.042 --> 31:20.503
And I don't want to stay in Mastic.
You been to Mastic?

31:21.004 --> 31:24.424
Uh-uh. No way. Whole town full of losers.
I-- I had to get out.

31:24.507 --> 31:27.635
I figure there was a way
to get my mind right.

31:28.344 --> 31:30.179
Get good at life.

31:30.972 --> 31:33.474
The army. Infantry.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.270
Do shit. "Army Strong."

31:38.980 --> 31:39.981
Right on.

31:42.358 --> 31:43.735
Then, poof...

31:44.611 --> 31:45.737
discharge...

31:47.697 --> 31:50.033
other than honorable.

31:50.116 --> 31:51.910
You know you can
appeal your status, right?

31:52.493 --> 31:53.703
No shit?

31:55.079 --> 31:56.080
No shit.

31:58.791 --> 32:00.793
I want to know
what the tourist is doing here.

32:03.546 --> 32:05.673
I mean, you're obviously
a civilian, right?

32:06.215 --> 32:07.216
You serve?

32:08.927 --> 32:10.803
Not in the military, no.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.430
On some sort of research trip, honey?

32:12.513 --> 32:15.058
Jake, I asked her to be here.
How about a little respect--

32:15.141 --> 32:16.559
Hold on. I can speak for myself.

32:19.103 --> 32:22.023
I get it.
What you've done makes you special.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.317
No one else can understand,
because they weren't there.

32:27.779 --> 32:31.199
You think guys stuck in OPs
were the only ones fighting these wars?

32:32.825 --> 32:35.453
Like you were the only ones
who'd ever seen bad shit?

32:37.080 --> 32:38.957
You ever got sent to a desert country

32:39.040 --> 32:42.961
to fight a war you can't win
and no one can tell you why?

32:44.671 --> 32:46.839
They don't tell you
how getting shot burns.

32:48.841 --> 32:52.303
In the face of massive damage,
maybe the body just registers heat.

32:53.346 --> 32:57.100
Or how a corpse feels in your arms.
The way it shifts.

32:57.183 --> 33:00.478
They're there and then they're not.

33:04.065 --> 33:06.234
They don't tell you
fighting for something you believe in

33:06.317 --> 33:07.902
will ruin your life, because...

33:10.989 --> 33:12.573
belief never stopped a bullet.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.542
Still think I need to do my research?

33:25.962 --> 33:30.049
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I sincerely am. I didn't realize.

33:37.765 --> 33:40.268
You had some things to say,
huh, Agent Madani?

33:41.185 --> 33:42.186
Thank you.

33:43.604 --> 33:45.606
Yeah, it, uh, it turns out I did.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.942
Better out than in.

33:48.693 --> 33:54.323
You know, I...
I look at all those guys, myself,

33:54.407 --> 33:56.367
so messed up by what we've done...

33:58.411 --> 33:59.996
what we were sent to do.

34:00.580 --> 34:04.375
It makes me wonder how anyone
just comes back and carries on.

34:05.376 --> 34:06.210
Hmm.

34:08.296 --> 34:12.967
Listen, with... with someone like Billy...

34:14.844 --> 34:20.058
was he a broken man before he went to war,
or did war turn him into something else?

34:21.142 --> 34:24.645
Russo was probably the most natural Marine
I've ever seen.

34:24.729 --> 34:26.189
Except for maybe Frank.

34:27.732 --> 34:31.319
It wasn't the war that twisted Billy.
It was greed.

34:34.739 --> 34:37.366
If I knew where Billy was, I'd tell you.

34:40.369 --> 34:44.207
Yeah, but would you tell me first,
or someone else?

34:46.876 --> 34:48.961
-I'm not sure I know what you mean.
-No?

34:50.797 --> 34:55.051
Look, Curtis, come on.
I just want to find a way to end it.

34:55.802 --> 34:57.887
And what way would that be, Agent Madani?

34:58.471 --> 35:00.556
Billy Russo behind bars.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.976
I thought maybe you would say
something different.

35:04.060 --> 35:04.977
Yeah?

35:05.061 --> 35:09.524
Because I wish Frank ended the whole
damn thing right on that carousel.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.192
Hmm.

35:18.449 --> 35:21.911
It still doesn't look so good.

35:25.748 --> 35:26.791
It's fine.

35:34.298 --> 35:36.801
It's almost like you were
looking forward to it.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.205
Assholes.

36:10.042 --> 36:12.670
Look, no offense,
but if it's all the same to you...

36:16.257 --> 36:17.258
What?

36:19.177 --> 36:20.178
Nothing.

36:20.928 --> 36:22.221
Knock yourself out.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.602
Whiskey and a beer, please.

36:41.699 --> 36:43.117
You earn that jacket?

36:43.993 --> 36:46.204
Or you buy it in some army surplus store?

36:47.413 --> 36:48.414
Earned it.

36:49.665 --> 36:51.417
Can you say the same for that face?

36:57.548 --> 36:59.091
You should see the other guy.

37:02.220 --> 37:07.016
I'd offer to buy you a drink, but wouldn't
want to further any airborne alcoholism.

37:07.808 --> 37:10.144
You drink with Marines, soldier?

37:11.729 --> 37:13.189
Only if I have to.

37:16.609 --> 37:19.612
Set 'em up again, both of us.

37:48.849 --> 37:51.769
This ain't even right.
I came here in good faith.

37:51.852 --> 37:55.815
You have no beef with me.
And I've done everything you asked.

37:55.898 --> 37:59.527
This may be shocking for you,
but I don't trust you.

38:18.462 --> 38:19.714
This your friend?

38:20.548 --> 38:22.883
Not the word I'd use.

38:23.467 --> 38:25.219
I think you're in the wrong place,
my friend.

38:26.012 --> 38:29.515
Yeah, well, I wonder
what was waiting for me at Turk's, huh?

38:29.598 --> 38:30.850
What could that be?

38:30.933 --> 38:35.021
What does the Punisher have to do
with my business in Chicago

38:35.104 --> 38:36.981
-Did you kill Konchevsky?
-No.

38:37.898 --> 38:38.899
Did you?

38:38.983 --> 38:43.529
Dima is my nephew.
I wouldn't lay a hand on that boy.

38:45.740 --> 38:46.907
Someone did.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.995
Someone who's chasing the girl,
photographs.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.998
It's time to start talking.

38:54.081 --> 38:56.125
I'm not the one who's gonna be talking.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.840
-Alive, please.
-Yes.

39:10.556 --> 39:12.475
-You ready?
-Come on.

40:40.062 --> 40:41.605
Come on, you piece of shit.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.401
You want to talk now?

40:49.113 --> 40:51.240
How about now? Come on!

41:08.716 --> 41:09.717
I'm...

41:10.551 --> 41:11.552
I'm not your enemy.

41:24.023 --> 41:25.024
Those photos.

41:26.233 --> 41:28.652
Who paid for 'em

41:29.778 --> 41:31.447
They would kill me if I told--

41:31.530 --> 41:33.032
Think I'm gonna do?

41:33.115 --> 41:36.285
Poloznev. Nikolai Poloznev.

41:36.368 --> 41:37.453
Where do I find him?

41:38.496 --> 41:39.538
Try the Internet.

41:51.091 --> 41:53.093
Yeah.

42:05.272 --> 42:07.942
-Swear to God, they made me do it, man.
-Yeah.

42:08.734 --> 42:12.613
Don't worry, Turk.
You did exactly what I wanted you to.

42:12.696 --> 42:17.034
Shit. I really don't ever want
to see you again.

42:17.117 --> 42:19.453
Yeah, well, the feeling's mutual.

42:24.124 --> 42:27.253
I shouldn't get this hammered.

42:27.336 --> 42:30.673
Why

42:31.674 --> 42:32.841
Never again.

42:36.929 --> 42:38.138
You miss it?

42:39.515 --> 42:40.641
Every day.

42:41.684 --> 42:44.061
Every goddamn day.
You know what I miss most?

42:45.271 --> 42:46.855
Miss my boys, you know?

42:47.648 --> 42:48.732
I hear you.

42:49.567 --> 42:52.069
You don't make friends like that
back in the world.

42:52.820 --> 42:55.990
Instead, you got to deal
with soft assholes like this.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.204
Want a little go-fast?

43:05.291 --> 43:06.542
I'm good, man.

43:08.836 --> 43:10.421
There's an army out there.

43:11.380 --> 43:14.967
On the streets, in bars like this.

43:15.050 --> 43:17.553
And they all feel the same as you and me.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.889
All they ever do
is tell us we're the problem,

43:20.973 --> 43:22.766
we're the ones that need to change.

43:23.475 --> 43:25.227
Maybe we're not the problem.

43:25.811 --> 43:28.480
Maybe it's the bullshit we came back to.

43:28.564 --> 43:30.107
You ever wonder what would happen...

43:31.317 --> 43:34.862
if we all just stood up
right at the same time...

43:36.905 --> 43:39.908
-and gave the entire world the finger?

43:40.701 --> 43:43.954
That would be some next-level shit.

43:44.538 --> 43:47.082
Guess I shouldn't be surprised,
coming from you.

43:47.166 --> 43:51.503
I mean, Billy Russo has always been
a next-level son of a bitch, right?

43:51.587 --> 43:53.756
I knew who you were
the second you sat down.

43:55.007 --> 43:57.009
It's a real pleasure to meet you...

43:58.677 --> 43:59.511
sir.

46:13.896 --> 46:15.272
Oh, good, you're back.

46:17.399 --> 46:18.525
Wow.

46:18.609 --> 46:20.611
Did that go really good or really bad?

46:24.573 --> 46:26.074
Well, what does bad look like?

46:28.285 --> 46:30.496
Konchevsky's people aren't after us.

46:31.455 --> 46:34.708
Somebody came after them. I got a name.

46:35.334 --> 46:36.335
Yeah?

46:36.418 --> 46:38.504
Nikolai Poloznev.

46:42.382 --> 46:43.717
Let's see.

46:45.093 --> 46:48.764
I don't think the Russian vor
have, like, a LinkedIn though, you know?

46:53.060 --> 46:56.104
Oh. S-H-one-T.

46:56.855 --> 47:00.651
Says, "Nikolai Poloznev
is a former Russian state policeman

47:00.734 --> 47:03.695
turned industrialist
with interests in oil, gas and shipping,

47:03.779 --> 47:05.739
valued at several billion dollars.

47:06.532 --> 47:08.158
A personal friend
of the Russian president,

47:08.242 --> 47:11.870
he has homes in several countries,
but currently resides in New York."

47:15.082 --> 47:16.208
So what now?

47:17.793 --> 47:20.254
I'm not sure this guy
plays three-card monte.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.025
Where are we going?

47:43.652 --> 47:46.363
My buddy Curtis. He's got a place for us.

47:46.947 --> 47:48.991
Madani's gonna be pissed
we didn't leave town.

47:49.074 --> 47:52.035
Yeah. She won't know the difference.

47:52.828 --> 47:55.998
Well, I put her credit card back,
so that should make her happy.

47:58.166 --> 48:00.002
When is that woman ever happy?
