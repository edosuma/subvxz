WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.301
<i>Previously on "Alias. "</i>

00:02.302 --> 00:03.535
What do you want?

00:03.536 --> 00:06.630
For me to succeed as
a double agent for The Covenant,

00:06.705 --> 00:07.773
I'll need your help.

00:07.774 --> 00:10.274
Your needs don't concern me.

00:12.779 --> 00:14.713
It's good to see you, Julia.

00:14.714 --> 00:16.448
Good to see you, too.

00:16.449 --> 00:18.183
You're being set up.

00:18.184 --> 00:22.848
His daughter, Sydney Bristow,
also CIA, goes by an alias.

00:22.922 --> 00:24.857
Julia Thorne.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.452
It's been 3 weeks since I found
out Sydney murdered Lazarey.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.361
I've been lying to my wife
for three weeks.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.463
You were ordered
not to say anything.

00:31.464 --> 00:33.766
She was ordered to find out
who murdered Lazarey.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.861
I'm engaged in preventing her
from doing her job.

00:36.936 --> 00:38.937
And that you're
protecting Sydney.

00:38.938 --> 00:40.239
Yeah.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.907
I'm no longer Sloane's handler.

00:41.908 --> 00:43.909
Dixon gave that job
to Sydney Bristow.

00:43.910 --> 00:47.038
Good. That frees you up
to focus on the Lazarey murder.

00:47.113 --> 00:48.447
I spoke to the leasing agent.

00:48.448 --> 00:49.681
According to their records,

00:49.682 --> 00:52.207
this office was leased
a year ago, November 24th.

00:52.285 --> 00:54.086
A 4-year lease paid in advance.

00:54.087 --> 00:55.087
Was there a name?

00:55.088 --> 00:56.588
Yes, there was.

00:56.589 --> 00:59.149
I believe she's the person
who killed Lazarey.

00:59.592 --> 01:02.092
Her name is Julia Thorne.

01:41.134 --> 01:43.634
Hello?

02:48.368 --> 02:49.935
Oh, Sydney.
Thank you.

02:49.936 --> 02:50.936
Thank you, Doctor.

02:50.937 --> 02:52.938
Good to see you.

02:52.939 --> 02:55.307
I know I haven't been
to group in a while.

02:55.308 --> 02:56.308
That's okay.

02:56.309 --> 02:58.777
We have another session tonight.

02:58.778 --> 03:01.338
I actually came here to talk
about something else.

03:01.414 --> 03:03.974
Is it your dreams?

03:04.050 --> 03:05.784
I've heard about
an experimental procedure

03:05.785 --> 03:07.486
used to recover lost memories.

03:07.487 --> 03:09.054
Neurostimulation therapy.

03:09.055 --> 03:12.218
Now, Sydney, before we discuss
this, let's give group a chance.

03:12.292 --> 03:15.125
Some of those people have been
in that group for 10 years.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.462
None seem to be closer
to finding out what happened.

03:17.463 --> 03:19.398
The point is to accept
what's happened,

03:19.399 --> 03:22.493
that you may never remember,
and free yourself to move on.

03:22.569 --> 03:26.562
With all due respect, you
don't know what it feels like.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.909
You have clearance. I can tell
you that unlike anyone else,

03:29.976 --> 03:33.139
there's a terrorist organization
trying to find out the one thing

03:33.213 --> 03:34.713
that I can't remember.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.815
My point being,
I don't have the luxury

03:36.816 --> 03:39.017
of waiting for acceptance.

03:39.018 --> 03:41.518
Come with me.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.324
This is Kenneth Blake.

03:45.325 --> 03:48.988
He joined
Central Intelligence in 1981.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.731
He was missing for five years.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.967
Finally turned up
in a South Korean hospital

03:54.968 --> 03:58.028
with severe injuries
and no memory whatsoever.

03:58.104 --> 04:02.336
Blake volunteered for the same
procedure you're asking for.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.908
The procedure was carried out.

04:05.311 --> 04:06.578
Blake learned he'd been

04:06.579 --> 04:09.480
in custody of the North Koreans
all that time,

04:09.549 --> 04:13.212
exposed to torture
so intense, so prolonged

04:13.286 --> 04:16.687
that his conscious mind
blacked it out.

04:16.755 --> 04:18.557
The invasive nature
of the surgery

04:18.558 --> 04:21.288
left him with permanent
brain damage.

04:21.361 --> 04:24.455
You should know, Sydney, that
the National Security Council

04:24.530 --> 04:28.091
considers Blake
a successful test case

04:28.167 --> 04:30.667
for neurostimulation therapy.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.799
I'd consider death as an option
before this procedure.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.725
You have been a busy man,
Javier Parez.

05:02.735 --> 05:05.070
Epidemiology lab in Cannes.

05:05.071 --> 05:07.506
Disease-control ministry
in Spain.

05:07.507 --> 05:10.738
Genetic-engineering
facility in Cuba.

05:11.077 --> 05:14.069
Do I turn you over to Cuba,
to Spain, to France?

05:14.147 --> 05:15.814
To me, there is no difference.

05:15.815 --> 05:20.377
For you, there is at least
one significant difference.

05:20.453 --> 05:23.718
France and Spain do not
believe in the death penalty.

05:28.194 --> 05:30.694
So here's
where we help each other.

05:32.365 --> 05:34.766
You provide me
with a bigger fish.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.935
The people who commission
you, for instance.

05:36.936 --> 05:40.667
And I allow you to choose
to whom I place my call.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.436
What if I told you I have
information that would be

05:43.509 --> 05:46.376
very interesting
to the Americans

05:46.446 --> 05:50.974
regarding a Central Intelligence
agent and a murder?

05:51.784 --> 05:54.548
A CIA agent committing murder.

05:55.755 --> 05:58.255
Hardly newsworthy.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.859
It is when it's done on behalf

06:00.860 --> 06:03.658
of an international
terrorist group,

06:03.730 --> 06:06.563
and the target
is a Russian diplomat.

06:12.705 --> 06:13.805
People, listen up.

06:13.806 --> 06:16.041
We've got non-cleared
personnel en route.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.743
Deactivate the wireless network,

06:17.744 --> 06:20.112
and put all secure servers
on lockdown.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.646
I don't want to see anything

06:21.647 --> 06:24.147
more revealing
than a weather map.

06:27.019 --> 06:29.020
Level-3 security
procedures in effect.

06:29.021 --> 06:31.456
All computer monitors
and LCDs on safe mode.

06:31.457 --> 06:34.119
Re-routing the PB X
to administration.

07:16.769 --> 07:20.899
I always knew you were
destined for great things.

07:24.010 --> 07:26.510
Follow me.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.660
Marshall.

07:41.661 --> 07:42.861
Mr. Sloane.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.596
Hi.

07:44.597 --> 07:47.191
It's been a while.
A lot has happened.

07:48.568 --> 07:51.068
First you were evil,
now you're good, so you claim.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.205
Not that I don't trust you.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.106
How are you?

07:55.107 --> 07:57.607
Very happy to see you, Marshall.

07:57.910 --> 08:00.410
Due to the sensitive nature
of the information

08:00.480 --> 08:02.380
Arvin Sloane is about
to present to us,

08:02.381 --> 08:05.282
I thought it would be best
if he did so here.

08:05.351 --> 08:06.985
Is everyone here?

08:06.986 --> 08:09.614
Agents Vaughn and Reed are
prepping a separate assignment

08:09.689 --> 08:12.189
under the direction of the NSC.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.958
10 hours ago,
I had a meeting with Mr. Sark.

08:16.028 --> 08:20.055
I assume we're here because
The Covenant requires something.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.670
Your new assignment.

08:27.306 --> 08:29.474
It seems The Covenant
is no longer satisfied

08:29.475 --> 08:32.273
with using my organization
merely as a front

08:32.345 --> 08:34.845
for their illegal activities.

08:35.081 --> 08:37.581
They've now tasked me
an operation.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.719
I presume you know
what a maser is.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.188
You mean a microwave laser?

08:43.188 --> 08:44.356
Well, yeah.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.985
I mean, you want me to explain?

08:47.059 --> 08:49.857
Marshall, Sloane has no
authority in this room.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.930
Sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you, sir.

08:51.931 --> 08:54.431
I know you're the main...
Do you want me to...

08:54.433 --> 08:55.767
Yes.

08:55.768 --> 08:58.828
It's a microwave that gets
focused into a pinpoint beam.

08:58.905 --> 09:01.635
Very similar to how light
gets focused into a laser.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.608
Tomorrow night,
I'm scheduled to attend

09:03.609 --> 09:05.810
a charity function hosted
by the Chinese government

09:05.811 --> 09:07.779
at one of their ministries.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.814
The Covenant
has acquired intelligence

09:09.815 --> 09:13.615
that China has designed
a working maser unit,

09:13.686 --> 09:16.985
the prototype of which
is held there.

09:17.623 --> 09:20.123
China intends to mount
a maser array

09:20.126 --> 09:22.527
on one of their
defense satellites.

09:22.528 --> 09:25.827
It is an assassination program.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.699
Wait, are you saying
that this weapon

09:27.700 --> 09:29.568
is capable of killing
from space?

09:29.569 --> 09:32.299
Pulsed microwaves are capable
of causing tissue damage,

09:32.371 --> 09:35.101
heart failure,
even brain hemorrhaging.

09:35.174 --> 09:38.541
This could make it appear the
victim died from natural causes.

09:38.611 --> 09:40.278
You can imagine
the potential threat

09:40.279 --> 09:42.647
if The Covenant were to acquire
this technology.

09:42.648 --> 09:45.583
I've been tasked to steal
the maser's operating system,

09:45.651 --> 09:48.176
which is in the Chinese
Defense Minister's office.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.589
I want Strategic Services
to review your plan,

09:50.590 --> 09:52.457
and I'll assign an agent
to go along.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.958
I presumed
that would be the case.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.162
I propose Sydney accompany me

09:57.163 --> 09:59.996
to the function,
posing as my assistant.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.566
Together we can obtain
the operating system,

10:02.602 --> 10:04.302
corrupt the maser,

10:04.303 --> 10:07.636
and pass along the faulty data
to The Covenant.

10:07.707 --> 10:11.040
That is, assuming the CIA

10:11.110 --> 10:13.311
still intends to use me
as a double agent.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.480
Why me?

10:15.481 --> 10:18.006
Because this mission
cannot be done alone.

10:18.084 --> 10:23.784
I will not risk my life unless
I'm going in with the best.

10:23.856 --> 10:25.056
Do you really imagine,

10:25.057 --> 10:27.092
given your history,
that we would ever...

10:27.093 --> 10:29.593
I'll go.

10:30.096 --> 10:32.497
You know I don't trust you,

10:32.498 --> 10:35.626
and that I believe you have an
endgame beyond this operation.

10:35.701 --> 10:38.864
But I also know
that if we're caught,

10:38.938 --> 10:40.839
we'll be standing side by side

10:40.840 --> 10:42.707
in front of
a Chinese firing squad,

10:42.708 --> 10:47.509
which means this time
our interests are in line.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.814
And if you betray me...

10:51.851 --> 10:54.479
I will just kill you myself.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.957
I understand you've been
loaned out to the NSC.

11:32.958 --> 11:34.459
I leave for Mexico in an hour.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.461
Lauren requested me.
She's briefing me en route.

11:36.462 --> 11:38.463
A contact of mine
in Nogales informed me

11:38.464 --> 11:39.964
that Javier Parez

11:39.965 --> 11:41.966
was apprehended
by Mexican authorities.

11:41.967 --> 11:44.302
I'm sure you remember him
as part of the team

11:44.303 --> 11:46.204
Sydney infiltrated
several weeks ago.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.673
Yeah, sort of.
He almost killed me.

11:48.674 --> 11:50.308
He's offered
to trade information

11:50.309 --> 11:52.143
to the NSC
in exchange for leniency.

11:52.144 --> 11:53.745
Our problem is this.

11:53.746 --> 11:55.714
He knows about Sydney.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.513
That she murdered Lazarey
under the alias Julia Thorne.

11:58.584 --> 12:00.819
You can imagine the consequences

12:00.820 --> 12:03.288
were he to share this
information with your wife.

12:03.289 --> 12:06.349
I think you should tell her
that you know the identity

12:06.425 --> 12:08.925
of the man you've been
sent to interview,

12:08.928 --> 12:11.428
and that conflict of interest
requires you both

12:11.430 --> 12:12.831
to remove yourself
from this case.

12:12.832 --> 12:15.392
Are you asking me to interfere
with my wife's investigation?

12:15.468 --> 12:16.568
Yes.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.602
No.

12:17.603 --> 12:20.504
I've kept the truth from Lauren
because Dixon ordered me to.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.073
A situation you orchestrated.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.702
You understand the consequences
to Sydney if this leaks.

12:24.777 --> 12:28.076
The NSC will subject her
to invasive brain surgery.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.348
I don't need a lecture
on the risks she faces.

12:30.349 --> 12:31.683
I don't understand
your resistance.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.518
The NSC will send
other operatives.

12:33.519 --> 12:34.853
They're gonna find out.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.755
It will provide us the time
to plan our next move.

12:37.823 --> 12:40.451
I think it's safe to say I know
my wife better than you do.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.727
I would hope.

12:42.728 --> 12:45.458
Lauren may be our best chance
of keeping this information

12:45.531 --> 12:46.531
from the NSC.

12:46.532 --> 12:49.524
And, Mr. Vaughn,
what if you're wrong?

12:53.506 --> 12:55.540
It's the latest
in cloaking technology.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.342
It's called optical camouflage.

12:57.343 --> 12:59.611
Now, basically,
if you take a look right here,

12:59.612 --> 13:01.279
its surface is covered
in microfilaments,

13:01.280 --> 13:03.874
which interpret the U.V. Waves
generated by its surroundings.

13:03.949 --> 13:08.613
Which means that once you drop
it off in the Chinese ministry,

13:08.687 --> 13:11.055
I will be able to
guide it undetected

13:11.056 --> 13:13.258
past the internal
security cameras

13:13.259 --> 13:14.425
to the alarm controls,

13:14.426 --> 13:17.884
which I'll then deactivate
using the internal modem.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.232
So, once you disable the alarms,

13:21.233 --> 13:23.434
I'll be able to access
the minister's office,

13:23.435 --> 13:24.702
where their maser is kept.

13:24.703 --> 13:27.570
Once you get to the maser,
you will access the motherboard.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.575
And then you will attach this
to the EPROM chip.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.441
Now, press one, and you'll
be connected to me.

13:33.512 --> 13:36.413
I will access the maser's
operating system and corrupt it,

13:36.482 --> 13:40.475
and then a copy
of the corrupted version

13:40.553 --> 13:41.953
will be stored onto this.

13:41.954 --> 13:44.787
Which I will give to Sloane
to pass on to The Covenant.

13:44.857 --> 13:47.357
Right.

13:47.359 --> 13:50.487
Actually, where did the car go?

14:09.081 --> 14:11.879
By the way, you look beautiful.

14:11.951 --> 14:14.451
Spare me.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.901
I would encourage you
to take my arm

14:29.902 --> 14:32.402
if we're gonna bluff
our way through this.

14:48.821 --> 14:51.321
Ladies.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.465
Mr. Sloane, we're honored
you could attend.

15:00.466 --> 15:02.500
The honor is mine, Minister Woo.

15:02.501 --> 15:06.096
And this is my executive
assistant, Christina Meyers.

15:06.171 --> 15:07.005
A pleasure.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.506
Pleasure.

15:09.608 --> 15:12.133
Your organization's
compassionate work

15:12.211 --> 15:14.646
is the model of humanitarian
achievement.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.781
Thank you.
Thank you.

15:16.782 --> 15:18.583
Miss Meyers,
would you give us a moment?

15:18.584 --> 15:20.718
I have a private matter
to discuss.

15:20.719 --> 15:23.219
Certainly.

15:27.626 --> 15:30.126
Your assistant is lovely.

15:30.162 --> 15:33.256
I presume she does
more for you than type.

15:33.332 --> 15:36.062
Our relationship
is strictly professional.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.635
Of course.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.651
Hello?
- You're on.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.815
Ladies and gentlemen,
start your engines.

16:34.626 --> 16:35.927
Okay.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.428
Promise me again
they won't hear it.

16:37.429 --> 16:40.694
The noise output is .04 dB,
which is inaudible to the ear.

16:40.766 --> 16:43.667
A cockroach thinks louder
than this car.

16:47.706 --> 16:50.206
Looks like a nice party.

16:50.609 --> 16:52.710
Okay.

16:52.711 --> 16:53.911
I'm gonna follow this guy.

16:53.912 --> 16:55.813
Looks like he knows
where he's going.

16:55.814 --> 16:58.314
Security.

17:04.455 --> 17:05.455
Are you all right?

17:05.457 --> 17:08.619
As long as Marshall can
shut down the security system.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.565
You know, Sydney,
we should dance.

17:14.566 --> 17:17.066
Like hell.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.536
The minister assumes
we're sleeping together.

17:20.939 --> 17:23.669
Despite my protests,
he remains unconvinced.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.576
I could care less.

17:25.577 --> 17:26.911
Well, neither would I

17:26.912 --> 17:29.881
if he wasn't constantly
looking in my direction.

17:29.948 --> 17:32.712
Normally, I would suggest
that we remain discreet.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.481
I think it best we feign
an argument on the dance floor.

17:35.554 --> 17:38.682
That would buy you
sufficient time to slip away.

17:38.757 --> 17:41.726
And, Sydney, given the way
you feel about me,

17:41.794 --> 17:44.162
I doubt it would take
much acting on your part.

17:44.163 --> 17:47.758
So, my dear, shall we?

17:53.472 --> 17:55.740
We have to get
to the security room.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.241
All right, following him.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.413
Okay. Ooh.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.914
Sorry.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.318
- Hurry up.
- I got to focus.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.731
Marshall, follow that guard.

18:23.802 --> 18:24.802
Turn to the right.

18:24.803 --> 18:27.271
I got it.
I got it.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.298
Good. He's approaching
the security control room.

18:30.375 --> 18:30.975
Hurry.

18:30.976 --> 18:33.476
Pedal to the metal, sir.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.547
Easy.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.784
Piece of cake.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.600
Hurry.
Marshall, under the desk.

18:55.601 --> 18:58.101
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

18:59.171 --> 19:00.705
Well done.

19:00.706 --> 19:03.141
Okay, now I will activate
the RF modem

19:03.142 --> 19:05.642
and hack into
the security system.

19:07.079 --> 19:10.674
Okay, alarms are down.
Surveillance is off.

19:19.091 --> 19:22.822
Should take them weeks to get
back online, maybe even months.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.012
Hello?

19:41.013 --> 19:42.813
Thank you.

19:42.814 --> 19:45.442
Marshall says the security
system is shut down.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.884
Well, then I propose you make
this fight look real.

20:10.842 --> 20:13.342
Oh, God, it's a boy.

20:21.853 --> 20:24.353
Get back in the car.

20:44.176 --> 20:45.176
We have them.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.144
The payment will be left
in the confessional

20:47.145 --> 20:49.773
of the San Angel Church
as instructed.

20:49.848 --> 20:53.375
Hold them for at least
two hours, then let them go.

20:53.986 --> 20:56.486
<i>Vamános, muchachos!</i>

21:48.974 --> 21:50.141
Marshall, I'm going in.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.542
Copy, Mountaineer.

21:51.543 --> 21:53.010
Security systems are offline.

21:53.011 --> 21:54.545
You're cleared for entry.

21:54.546 --> 21:57.743
Keep your face covered. You
can't afford to be recognized.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.410
Checking for sensors.

22:26.411 --> 22:28.911
We're good.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.567
Okay, Marshall,
uplink established.

22:49.568 --> 22:53.197
Copy that, Mountaineer. Give me
two seconds to corrupt the code.

23:01.947 --> 23:04.447
- Uh-oh.
- What's the matter?

23:04.649 --> 23:07.584
Security system is back online.
I don't know how they did it.

23:07.652 --> 23:10.587
- Can you get it back offline?
- Give me two seconds.

23:16.294 --> 23:17.895
You may have been compromised.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.797
- Get out.
- Marshall, how much longer?

23:19.798 --> 23:21.065
No!
Get out of there now.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.166
How long?

23:22.167 --> 23:23.601
Just give me one minute.

24:32.838 --> 24:34.004
Marshall, are you done?

24:34.005 --> 24:36.505
Yeah.
Go, go, go.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.348
You are very lucky
they let you go.

24:44.349 --> 24:47.580
Crime on the highways
has become an embarrassment.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.520
If you'd like to file a report,

24:49.521 --> 24:52.354
I will see that it receives
the highest priority.

24:52.424 --> 24:53.724
No, thank you.

24:53.725 --> 24:56.353
We'd like to extradite
Mr. Parez as soon as possible.

24:56.428 --> 24:58.729
Very well.

24:58.730 --> 25:01.230
This way.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.745
<i>Ay, Dios mío.</i>

25:19.784 --> 25:22.548
Who else has been to see
Mr. Parez since he arrived?

25:22.621 --> 25:23.420
No one.

25:23.421 --> 25:26.948
I am truly sorry you came
this way for nothing.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.467
You'll give this
to The Covenant.

25:36.468 --> 25:39.096
It contains the corrupted copy
of the operating system.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.639
The Covenant will track it
back to the Chinese prototype,

25:41.640 --> 25:43.807
which has also been corrupted.

25:43.808 --> 25:46.368
They won't suspect
that you betrayed them.

25:46.444 --> 25:48.579
I see.

25:48.580 --> 25:51.674
I wonder how many times your
handler said something like that

25:51.750 --> 25:54.275
before you were about to
give me something like this.

25:54.352 --> 25:57.844
A small object
of tremendous value

25:57.923 --> 26:00.585
that I asked you to steal
for SD-6,

26:00.659 --> 26:02.493
which you then
rendered worthless

26:02.494 --> 26:05.657
in order to prevent its
exploitation by The Alliance.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.230
It happened on occasion.

26:10.969 --> 26:13.137
There was a time you trusted me.

26:13.138 --> 26:15.766
It was before
I knew who you were.

26:17.042 --> 26:19.410
It was before I knew who I was.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.936
Oh, no, it was
more recent than that.

26:22.013 --> 26:24.114
The day you were found
in Hong Kong.

26:24.115 --> 26:27.482
The day of your resurrection,
as it were.

26:29.621 --> 26:32.385
This letter arrived
at my office.

26:35.894 --> 26:38.454
My analyst confirmed
what I recognized instantly.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.030
What I'm sure you'll verify
on your own.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.769
The handwriting is yours.

26:54.212 --> 26:56.647
I've never seen that code
before.

26:56.648 --> 26:58.682
I didn't want to offer it
to anyone else.

26:58.683 --> 27:01.447
Unfortunately, I couldn't
decipher it myself.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.854
Since those items
were in your possession,

27:03.855 --> 27:06.355
I thought you might
want them back.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.533
Let's talk.

27:16.534 --> 27:19.034
Of course.

27:23.108 --> 27:25.275
You killed Javier Parez,
you son of a bitch.

27:25.276 --> 27:27.801
You've just returned
from a traumatic experience.

27:27.879 --> 27:29.179
You're emotional,

27:29.180 --> 27:31.582
which would explain
your baseless accusation.

27:31.583 --> 27:32.816
I am emotional.

27:32.817 --> 27:36.082
I get that way when I see a gun
pressed to my wife's temple.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.921
Ours is a risky business.

27:37.922 --> 27:39.390
Armed rebels take us hostage,

27:39.391 --> 27:41.458
then let us go out of
the kindness of their hearts?

27:41.459 --> 27:43.394
You didn't think
I'd see through that?

27:43.395 --> 27:44.862
You were graced by luck.

27:44.863 --> 27:47.231
You expect me to believe
a man on the verge

27:47.232 --> 27:49.757
of bartering for his freedom
decided to hang himself?

27:49.834 --> 27:52.962
Parez had a price on his head.
He knew his days were numbered.

27:53.038 --> 27:55.939
What part of this doesn't have
a rational explanation?

27:56.007 --> 27:59.704
You ever put my wife's life in
danger again, I will kill you.

28:01.780 --> 28:04.280
Then perhaps
you finally understand

28:04.282 --> 28:06.550
the moral compromises you make

28:06.551 --> 28:09.816
when someone you love
is in danger.

28:54.833 --> 28:56.266
Get in the car.

28:56.267 --> 28:58.767
Please.

29:07.479 --> 29:10.778
I've jammed the feed of the TV
cameras, so let us speak freely.

29:10.849 --> 29:12.516
You know who I am?

29:12.517 --> 29:14.418
Yes.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.686
I understand your investigation

29:15.687 --> 29:18.451
into the Lazarey murder
has hit a dead end.

29:18.523 --> 29:19.723
What a pity.

29:19.724 --> 29:20.958
How do you know?

29:20.959 --> 29:23.160
I know because I framed
Javier Parez,

29:23.161 --> 29:26.028
assuming he'd be extradited
to the United States.

29:26.097 --> 29:29.032
Once in custody, he'd be forced
to confess what he knows.

29:29.100 --> 29:32.092
Namely the identity
of Andrian Lazarey's murderer.

29:32.170 --> 29:34.866
This is the second time
I've had a gun put to my head.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.840
I don't particularly like it.

29:36.841 --> 29:39.042
I assume if you wanted me dead,
I would be,

29:39.043 --> 29:42.035
so if you have something
to tell me, do it.

29:49.687 --> 29:51.421
A wedding present.

29:51.422 --> 29:52.723
A touch informal, I know,

29:52.724 --> 29:55.818
but everything else
on your registry was taken.

29:56.394 --> 29:58.894
Open it.

30:06.504 --> 30:08.105
Where did you get these?

30:08.106 --> 30:09.506
Where is not important.

30:09.507 --> 30:12.007
What is important is who.

30:12.177 --> 30:13.610
Her name is Julia Thorne.

30:13.611 --> 30:15.679
Merely an alias.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.581
She goes by another name.

30:17.582 --> 30:20.176
A name you're quite
familiar with.

30:23.254 --> 30:25.489
Oh, my God.

30:25.490 --> 30:28.926
Now you should understand
why I've risked coming to you.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.861
I recently learned
that Sydney Bristow

30:30.862 --> 30:33.490
murdered a father
I never had a chance to know.

30:35.233 --> 30:37.601
I suspect you have reasons
for disliking her.

30:37.602 --> 30:40.969
Therefore, I'm confident that
you'll relay this information

30:41.039 --> 30:43.539
to the appropriate parties.

30:44.742 --> 30:47.242
By the way, I've rigged
a weight-sensitive charge

30:47.245 --> 30:49.379
to the underside
of this vehicle.

30:49.380 --> 30:51.880
Once I leave you,
I'll activate it.

30:51.950 --> 30:53.383
If you get out of the car

30:53.384 --> 30:57.184
before 30 minutes has elapsed,
the charge will detonate.

30:58.890 --> 31:01.390
It has been a pleasure,
Miss Reed.

31:27.085 --> 31:28.085
Hello?

31:28.086 --> 31:29.920
- It's me.
- Dad.

31:29.921 --> 31:32.421
Are you all right?
You sound upset.

31:32.991 --> 31:35.491
Yeah.
No, I'm fine.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.160
Did you receive my transmission?

31:37.161 --> 31:40.392
Yes. Sloane gave you a key,
which he claims was sent to him

31:40.465 --> 31:42.466
sometime before you
woke up in Hong Kong.

31:42.467 --> 31:43.934
His claim was pretty convincing.

31:43.935 --> 31:45.502
It was written
in my handwriting.

31:45.503 --> 31:47.037
The ciphertext as well?

31:47.038 --> 31:49.072
Yes.
Why?

31:49.073 --> 31:51.275
Remember during the time
you were missing,

31:51.276 --> 31:53.243
I contacted your mother?

31:53.244 --> 31:57.078
That ciphertext was encoded
using a method she devised.

31:57.782 --> 31:59.750
Does this mean I was
in contact with Mom

31:59.751 --> 32:01.485
during the two years I was gone?

32:01.486 --> 32:03.253
If that's true,
she failed to mention it

32:03.254 --> 32:04.655
during our last communication.

32:04.656 --> 32:06.023
Can you break the code?

32:06.024 --> 32:08.392
Yes, I learned the code
from your mother.

32:08.393 --> 32:09.793
It's an address in Rome.

32:09.794 --> 32:14.390
1124 Piazza Barberini,
the penthouse apartment.

32:14.465 --> 32:16.990
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.

32:17.068 --> 32:19.764
I had a local contact
pull up the property record.

32:19.837 --> 32:22.139
The apartment was purchased
a year ago.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.836
The buyer chose
to remain anonymous.

32:24.909 --> 32:27.244
Get some rest.

32:27.245 --> 32:30.305
When you get back, you and I
will go to Rome together.

32:31.282 --> 32:33.782
Okay.

32:44.829 --> 32:45.896
Are you all right?

32:45.897 --> 32:48.065
Yes.

32:48.066 --> 32:50.566
Did he hurt you?

32:51.269 --> 32:53.769
No.

32:55.239 --> 32:57.739
I am so sorry.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.476
We'll find him.

33:01.045 --> 33:05.379
He told me Julia Thorne
is really Sydney Bristow.

33:11.356 --> 33:13.856
I wasn't sure if you knew.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.492
Now I know.

33:18.162 --> 33:20.530
I was under orders
not to say anything.

33:20.531 --> 33:21.598
- Whose orders?
- Dixon.

33:21.599 --> 33:23.734
Dixon knows?
And Jack, Weiss, everyone?

33:23.735 --> 33:26.069
- That's not the point.
- It's exactly the point.

33:26.070 --> 33:28.472
Everyone at that office
kept secret from the NSC

33:28.473 --> 33:31.874
the one thing I have desperately
been trying to learn.

33:32.310 --> 33:33.710
How long have you known?

33:33.711 --> 33:35.612
Three weeks.

33:35.613 --> 33:36.613
For three weeks

33:36.614 --> 33:38.615
you've been trying to derail
my investigation!

33:38.616 --> 33:40.517
Sydney doesn't remember
any of it.

33:40.518 --> 33:41.952
Do not defend her to me.

33:41.953 --> 33:43.420
I am explaining why Dixon...

33:43.421 --> 33:45.822
I am your wife.

33:45.823 --> 33:47.524
You kept Sydney's secret
from me.

33:47.525 --> 33:50.517
You protected Sydney over me,
something I refuse to do.

33:50.595 --> 33:52.729
It's not that simple.

33:52.730 --> 33:53.897
Do you still love her?

33:53.898 --> 33:55.532
That's not what this is about!

33:55.533 --> 33:58.033
She is not my wife!

33:58.569 --> 34:01.834
You can't punish her for the
fact that she and I had a past.

34:01.906 --> 34:04.274
If you report this to Lindsey,
he's gonna want to know

34:04.275 --> 34:06.176
everything she did
over those two years.

34:06.177 --> 34:07.177
As well he should.

34:07.178 --> 34:08.879
The only way
to access her memory

34:08.880 --> 34:10.614
is through a dangerous
invasive procedure.

34:10.614 --> 34:11.848
I'm aware of the procedures.

34:11.849 --> 34:13.750
None of which they would force
on a U.S. Agent.

34:13.751 --> 34:15.685
Lazarey was a Russian diplomat.

34:15.686 --> 34:18.280
All Lindsey has to do is form
an extradition agreement

34:18.356 --> 34:20.456
with the Russians, and she
will be shipped to Moscow,

34:20.458 --> 34:22.359
where she has no rights
as an American.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.860
He'll run the procedure there.

34:23.860 --> 34:26.360
He can't do that.
She's a CIA operative.

34:26.364 --> 34:28.764
Think about it.
You know better than anyone.

34:28.766 --> 34:31.360
Lindsey will not hesitate
to break the rules.

34:31.436 --> 34:33.936
If he learns about this,
Sydney...

34:38.309 --> 34:40.077
Oh, God, Lauren.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.279
You already reported her.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.081
You followed your orders.

34:44.081 --> 34:46.283
I followed mine.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.784
Michael.

35:02.767 --> 35:03.767
Hello?

35:03.768 --> 35:05.368
Sydney, it's me.
Don't go home.

35:05.369 --> 35:07.471
The NSC knows everything.
Meet me at terminal one.

35:07.472 --> 35:09.997
I'll explain everything
once I pick you up.

35:11.008 --> 35:13.110
How the hell did they find out?

35:13.111 --> 35:14.111
Sark told Lauren.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.513
I have a plane waiting
at the Dover Airfield.

35:16.514 --> 35:19.074
It'll take you
anywhere you want to go.

35:19.150 --> 35:20.550
Someplace you can disappear.

35:20.551 --> 35:22.586
If the NSC wants to find me,
they will.

35:22.587 --> 35:24.087
I was someone else
for two years.

35:24.088 --> 35:25.822
Someone I don't even remember.

35:25.823 --> 35:28.656
What am I supposed to do now?
Just spend my life in hiding?

35:28.726 --> 35:30.694
Between that and a lobotomy,
there isn't a choice.

35:30.695 --> 35:32.629
I can't keep running forever.

35:32.630 --> 35:35.656
I'll do everything I can
to make sure you won't have to.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.301
Rome.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.802
I'm going to Rome.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.981
<i>Grazie, Giancarlo.</i>

35:56.220 --> 35:59.246
There's a café at the corner of
Via del Corso and Via Condotti.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.524
Café Ruby.

36:00.525 --> 36:01.958
There's a pay phone
with a false bottom.

36:01.959 --> 36:04.459
You'll find money
and a new passport.

36:05.062 --> 36:07.562
Good thing I'm already packed.

36:07.832 --> 36:10.332
You should go.

36:15.406 --> 36:17.906
Vaughn.

36:18.042 --> 36:20.542
Why are you doing this?

36:22.013 --> 36:24.607
My life is already a disaster.

36:26.083 --> 36:28.583
And now yours is, too.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.853
What happened between us.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.524
Everything.

36:34.525 --> 36:39.986
The way it is...
isn't anyone's fault, Sydney.

36:41.933 --> 36:44.433
And even though
everything's changed...

36:46.804 --> 36:49.304
some things don't.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.706
I'm not gonna lose you twice.

37:34.151 --> 37:36.651
Thank you.

38:12.056 --> 38:14.556
<i>Grazie.</i>

38:30.074 --> 38:32.574
<i>Ciao.</i>

38:33.978 --> 38:35.745
Sydney didn't check in
this morning,

38:35.746 --> 38:38.246
and she's not answering
her cellphone.

38:39.183 --> 38:41.351
Do you know where she is?

38:41.352 --> 38:43.852
I don't know.

38:49.060 --> 38:52.587
Director Dixon, I need to speak
with you in your office, please.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.332
Of course.

39:04.875 --> 39:07.110
The NSC knows that Sydney
was responsible

39:07.111 --> 39:09.611
for Lazarey's murder,
don't they?

39:11.048 --> 39:14.245
I presume you're the one who
helped her disappear last night.

39:15.119 --> 39:18.885
What else are you willing to do
to see Sydney through this?

39:21.525 --> 39:23.693
What did you have in mind?

39:23.694 --> 39:26.194
- Please sit.
- No, thank you.

39:27.431 --> 39:32.459
Director Dixon, you've always
been direct and fair with me,

39:32.536 --> 39:36.472
which is why I take no pleasure
in what I'm about to say.

39:37.174 --> 39:39.836
Under authority of
the National Security Council,

39:39.910 --> 39:42.379
Robert Lindsey has instructed me
to relieve you of duty

39:42.380 --> 39:45.508
as director of this task force
until he arrives.

39:45.583 --> 39:46.649
On what grounds?

39:46.650 --> 39:48.284
Obstruction of justice.

39:48.285 --> 39:51.277
Willingly conspiring to impede
an international investigation

39:51.355 --> 39:53.855
into the murder
of Andrian Lazarey.

39:54.158 --> 39:57.355
I have photographic evidence
Sydney Bristow was his killer.

39:58.262 --> 40:00.762
We've learned you've known
about this for some time.

40:00.831 --> 40:02.532
It is within my purview

40:02.533 --> 40:05.366
to compartmentalize
information, Lauren.

40:05.436 --> 40:08.030
If Bob Lindsey has issue
with that, he can take it up

40:08.105 --> 40:09.973
with the director
of Central Intelligence.

40:09.974 --> 40:11.374
He has.

40:11.375 --> 40:14.208
Feel free to call D.C.I.
Yourself for confirmation,

40:14.278 --> 40:17.543
though I suspect your phone
will be ringing any moment.

40:17.615 --> 40:19.582
These premises are to be
locked down

40:19.583 --> 40:21.818
until Lindsey arrives
with Federal agents.

40:21.819 --> 40:24.879
That means until such time,
nobody leaves.

40:24.955 --> 40:26.790
I take it you have Sydney
in custody.

40:26.791 --> 40:30.192
Not yet,
but we know where she is.

42:25.943 --> 42:27.810
Aah!
