'Italy was relieved today upon learning...

01:42.502 --> 01:46.962
'that the country's high court had ruled
that influence peddling is not a crime.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.378
'Said Franco Ferrarotti,
an Italian sociologist:

01:52.846 --> 01:55.815
'Essentially, the judges are saying
what everybody believes.'

01:55.882 --> 01:58.544
'He was referring to raccomendazione...

01:59.252 --> 02:02.881
'the Italian custom of seeking
special treatment from people in power.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.959
'This is our version of the Protestant ethic,'
Mr. Ferrarotti said.

02:09.662 --> 02:12.597
'The case concerned a clerk of a civil court
in Potenza...

02:12.665 --> 02:16.066
'who was jailed for promising
to speed up someone's trial.

02:16.236 --> 02:19.296
'Evidence showed that
he received 88 pounds of fish...

02:19.372 --> 02:21.602
'in return for his assistance. '

03:31.311 --> 03:32.300
Hello.

03:33.246 --> 03:34.440
Yeah, she's here.

03:35.315 --> 03:37.078
She's on duty today.

03:37.817 --> 03:39.614
The same, undercover.

03:40.353 --> 03:42.446
Yeah, let me have her call you back.

03:42.522 --> 03:44.456
Deb, it was your mom.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.807
You're complaining about
your paper on ethnicity.

04:06.879 --> 04:09.370
Here's some interesting stuff
from your own background.

04:09.449 --> 04:10.882
We're from Potenza?

04:11.284 --> 04:13.411
I thought we were
Napoli-Daboli or whatever.

04:13.486 --> 04:16.421
Neapolitan. But this
is about Italy as a whole.

04:17.757 --> 04:21.692
Did the squirrels eat the bread I put out
for the ducks, or somebody sweep it up?

04:21.761 --> 04:25.128
I do know that Meadow stepped
in some soggy bread with her bare feet.

04:25.198 --> 04:26.927
You should've heard it.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.233
What's that?

04:29.636 --> 04:33.572
This is the New York Times that your friend
here has delivered to him at school...

04:33.640 --> 04:36.575
for his Social Studies requirement,
then he doesn't read them.

04:36.643 --> 04:39.840
I find them piled in his room.
- Make a go of it at that new school.

04:39.912 --> 04:42.244
You got no idea
what we did to get you in there.

04:42.315 --> 04:45.443
There is no reason you shouldn't
be able to pass Social Studies.

04:45.518 --> 04:47.418
You passing Social Studies?

04:47.820 --> 04:50.050
You just revealed your own ignorance.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.717
It's only been five days.
We didn't get grades yet.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.887
I what? I revealed my own what?

05:06.406 --> 05:07.737
Look at that.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.071
Now, he's reading.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.381
Hey, everybody.
- Where's Furio?

05:27.560 --> 05:28.857
How you doing, Ton'?

05:28.928 --> 05:30.828
A.J., finish getting dressed.

05:31.197 --> 05:33.495
You want some coffee?
- No.

05:33.566 --> 05:36.933
Has Furio got that bug again?
- Tony likes to mix it up, you know.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.129
Different cars.

05:42.775 --> 05:43.867
What, the Caprice?

05:44.510 --> 05:46.273
No, he's turning off.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.771
Take me to my uncle's doctor.

05:49.649 --> 05:52.948
Furio called me.
He's going to the fucking track today.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.446
So what about it?
- I don't know.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.184
I'm driving again, all of a sudden.

05:59.258 --> 06:01.920
So what? I gotta explain
why I want you with me this week?

06:01.994 --> 06:04.394
God forbid you'd explain.
- That's right.

06:04.464 --> 06:08.525
Now you're gonna get fresh about it?
- I'm just saying, I mean, I'm glad to do it.

06:08.601 --> 06:10.398
I'm glad you're glad.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.603
You know, your father was
like a mentor to me.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.477
Right.
- A standup.

06:22.949 --> 06:25.782
You ask anybody.
Your old man was a legend.

06:26.285 --> 06:29.345
He single-handedly hunted down
that New England crew.

06:29.522 --> 06:32.150
Brought the war home to them up there.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.251
Another Chevy.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.792
Nuns.

06:42.602 --> 06:45.162
Might be undercover Feds, but I doubt it.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.513
He must be colicky.

07:03.823 --> 07:06.417
I think he likes your hair better that way.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.491
Mr. Soprano.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.397
There she is.

07:17.470 --> 07:20.769
You be good now, don't start.
- You ought to see my finish.

07:22.508 --> 07:24.874
You get sued for talk like that nowadays.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.378
Then cancel my appointment.
Let me die now.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.415
If a man can't voice to a beautiful woman...

07:29.482 --> 07:31.575
the zephyrs that are blowing
through his mind-

07:31.651 --> 07:33.209
God, listen to him today.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.050
Go in there now,
and strip down to your shorts.

07:36.956 --> 07:40.653
You see now? I'm not gonna touch that line.
Too much class.

07:41.060 --> 07:44.496
But as for that lovely laugh line-
- Come on, handsome, we're busy.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.896
Give me that cheek, right here.

07:47.567 --> 07:50.195
I surrender, do with me what you will.
- Okay.

07:52.271 --> 07:54.466
The doctor will be with you both.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.742
So, what'd you wanna see me about?

08:05.818 --> 08:08.878
My trial starts a week from Tuesday.
- You'll beat it.

08:09.088 --> 08:12.387
Melvoin's good.
- We have to change our arrangement.

08:18.598 --> 08:20.065
Which arrangement is that?

08:20.132 --> 08:22.498
These fucking lawyers
are taking my internal organs.

08:22.568 --> 08:25.935
$1 million for this triaI,
Melvoin and Hirshorn are charging.

08:26.038 --> 08:28.006
And that was bad enough.

08:28.374 --> 08:30.865
Now they put this Harvard kid on,
this lackey.

08:30.943 --> 08:32.534
I don't know what the fuck he does.

08:32.611 --> 08:36.207
And then they just decided
we needed audibility experts to testify...

08:36.282 --> 08:40.412
you can't definitively state what people
are saying on the government tapes.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.414
I could fucking tell them that.

08:42.488 --> 08:45.252
Those guys,
they got sound graphs and shit.

08:45.324 --> 08:47.656
$50,000, the cocksuckers are charging.

08:47.727 --> 08:51.458
Plus the minimization expert,
plus the fucking monthly expenses.

08:51.597 --> 08:53.997
Fucking lexis fees, the Xeroxing.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.697
An entire Northwest forest
must've given its life in Xerox paper...

08:57.770 --> 08:59.169
for this one fucking trial.

08:59.238 --> 09:01.729
I said to MeI,
'Can't we just at one fucking meeting...

09:01.807 --> 09:04.367
'all read from the same sheet of paper,
pass it around?'

09:04.443 --> 09:06.138
Our split stays the same.

09:08.848 --> 09:12.113
You kept me in place as boss
to take the heat off you.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.885
My legal problems have let you
go around like a gabavreche...

09:15.955 --> 09:17.923
two fucking years now.
- There you go.

09:17.990 --> 09:18.979
Ten points.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.123
I got medical bills, too, Anthony.

09:22.194 --> 09:24.128
I got cash flow problems of my own.

09:24.196 --> 09:27.393
A one-time hit, $50,000, $75,000
to cover the audibility expert.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.365
I got two kids in private schools.

09:29.435 --> 09:30.902
Goddamn it!

09:30.970 --> 09:34.701
Get your shy running right.
That's what you should be focused on.

09:48.654 --> 09:52.488
Would you like to try some kielbasa?
Kentshire farms. Nitrate-free.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.499
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I like Versace's dinnerware...

10:01.567 --> 10:04.866
but stamping your face
on every plate... The ego!

10:07.740 --> 10:09.298
Look who's here.

10:09.775 --> 10:12.039
My God, what are you doing home?

10:14.914 --> 10:17.849
I got to get this out to my car.
- Is that for us?

10:19.552 --> 10:21.452
You're in a good mood.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.381
Want me to fix you a plate?

10:25.257 --> 10:27.350
Will you shut that pocket rat up?

10:27.426 --> 10:30.054
You wanna say hello to Danielle?
- Not really.

10:30.529 --> 10:33.259
I should go, anyhow.
- Enjoy your wine.

10:33.733 --> 10:37.169
Don't listen to his bullshit.
- I got to get up early tomorrow.

10:37.236 --> 10:40.137
No matter how much the john offers you?
- Pig.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.236
This is beautiful.

10:45.778 --> 10:48.975
Where'd you get it?
- You said you were gonna go. Go.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.916
I got to get some sleep.
- I should go.

10:55.988 --> 10:59.719
Froze to death in that mall today.
They go crazy with the air-conditioning.

11:00.192 --> 11:03.161
So, when am I gonna see you again?
- I'll call you.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.758
Okay, sweetie.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.997
Some of those bags look like Gucci.

11:09.068 --> 11:12.231
Yeah, he gets that stuff all the time.
His cousin's a liquidator.

11:12.304 --> 11:13.771
Bye.
- See you.

11:17.109 --> 11:20.636
You are so fucking rude.
- I had a horrible goddamn day.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.647
She's over here all the time lately.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.611
Tony still acting all mean?

11:28.421 --> 11:31.390
Cosette, quiet.
- Fucking asshole.

11:31.957 --> 11:35.791
Ever since I questioned his judgment
on some RalphielJackie Junior problem.

11:35.861 --> 11:39.627
Like he's fucking infallible.
Pope Tony XXlll or some shit.

11:39.699 --> 11:44.102
And now, of course, he starts in with
my father so I can be compared all negative.

11:44.503 --> 11:47.734
You never know, I could
be on the endangered species list.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.069
Chrissy.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.034
Gonna get high?

11:52.111 --> 11:54.739
Maybe I'll just smoke some.

11:55.347 --> 11:57.042
That's more addictive than shooting.

11:57.116 --> 12:00.552
I don't do it every fucking day now,
like some people.

12:00.853 --> 12:03.048
I'm just chipping, I got it under control.

12:03.255 --> 12:05.223
Chrissy, Tony loves you.

12:05.291 --> 12:08.727
Why would he have you made
if he didn't depend on you?

12:09.528 --> 12:11.257
He can depend on me.

12:13.265 --> 12:16.325
When the fuck have
I ever not been there 100 percent?

13:13.526 --> 13:14.857
Want some?

13:16.028 --> 13:17.859
Can I talk to you a minute?

13:23.502 --> 13:24.833
Turn this off?

13:25.805 --> 13:27.238
Turn it down.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.772
I'm worried, Tony.

13:34.847 --> 13:37.145
About my weight?
- About money.

13:37.449 --> 13:41.249
You're getting a little less allowance
than usual. I told you, it's temporary.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.584
Super Bowl last year,
we didn't lay enough off.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.146
No, it's not just that.

13:45.224 --> 13:47.624
I'm worried about you, about the future...

13:47.693 --> 13:50.059
about me and the kids,
if something happens to you.

13:50.129 --> 13:52.393
I don't provide for you?
- Now.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.300
I saw Angie Bonpensiero today.

13:55.801 --> 13:59.134
She was handing out
free Polish sausage at the supermarket.

13:59.205 --> 14:02.197
Don't start. I supported her.
You're so worried about the money.

14:02.274 --> 14:04.708
Who is gonna support
your children and me...

14:04.777 --> 14:06.642
if, God forbid, something happens to you?

14:06.712 --> 14:09.146
That's the point. Sil? Paulie?

14:09.682 --> 14:12.617
That is frightening.
- You'll be taken care of.

14:26.565 --> 14:29.762
You're set in perpetuity.
There's money in overseas accounts.

14:29.835 --> 14:31.302
I don't have the serial numbers.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.100
You'll have them when the time comes.
Not now.

14:34.173 --> 14:37.074
For your own benefit.
So you're not an accomplice.

14:40.679 --> 14:43.273
Jesus Christ, I been busting
my pick all day long...

14:43.349 --> 14:45.579
to bring home the money
you're so concerned about.

14:45.651 --> 14:49.519
I thought maybe I could have a sundae
and zone out in front of the frigging TV.

14:49.588 --> 14:53.024
Because, A: you're right,
my job is extremely stressful...

14:57.096 --> 15:01.089
I am talking about some
simple estate planning, Tony, that's all.

15:01.467 --> 15:05.870
My cousin, Brian Cammarata, has helped
lots of people set up trusts for their kids...

15:06.038 --> 15:09.132
begin asset allocation-
- I got to spell this out for you?

15:09.208 --> 15:11.733
I can't declare X amount of my income.

15:11.810 --> 15:14.540
Your consulting fees
from Barone Sanitation you do.

15:14.613 --> 15:17.605
We file a tax return
to justify the house, the cars.

15:17.683 --> 15:20.379
We could put aside some of that
to start a portfolio.

15:20.452 --> 15:21.510
Stocks?

15:21.587 --> 15:24.647
You gotta be high in the
corporate structure to make that work.

15:24.723 --> 15:27.317
We don't have
those Enron-type connections.

15:27.960 --> 15:28.949
Bonds, then.

15:29.028 --> 15:31.758
There are these things called 'REITs'
Brian told me about.

15:31.830 --> 15:33.661
Bonds, where's the capital for that?

15:33.732 --> 15:36.292
In the Caymans or under the mattress...

15:36.368 --> 15:38.393
or wherever you put it at zero growth.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.938
The money stays put.
With what's going on globally...

15:41.006 --> 15:43.839
There's always some excuse.
- There's no cash in this house.

15:43.909 --> 15:45.843
Not since our last bust.

15:45.911 --> 15:47.344
Check the vents.

15:48.747 --> 15:51.682
And I provide for my children.
- Yes, Tony, you do.

15:52.051 --> 15:54.713
But I don't know how you do it,
because you won't tell me.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.950
Let me tell you something,
or you can watch the fucking news:

15:58.023 --> 15:59.718
Everything comes to an end.

16:10.402 --> 16:11.892
Good morning, Ton'.

16:13.739 --> 16:16.833
They over there?
- I was able to reach everybody.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.770
What the fuck are you doing?

16:19.845 --> 16:22.541
What?
- You're wasting fucking ice.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.481
It's mostly melted.
- You're fucking arguing with me now?

16:25.551 --> 16:26.540
No, Ton'.

16:26.618 --> 16:30.213
You don't see the monthly statements.
We're hemorrhaging money out of here.

16:30.289 --> 16:32.484
No, you're right, I don't.

16:32.558 --> 16:36.324
Think that shit grows on trees?
- Ice? No, I don't.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.195
Are you getting cute with me?
- No.

16:40.265 --> 16:43.098
I think you are.
You're getting a fucking attitude on you.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.362
I'm not.

16:48.474 --> 16:51.875
Ice, when it hangs around-
- Georgie, be quiet.

16:52.811 --> 16:55.575
But it gets watery. It dilutes the drinks...

16:55.647 --> 16:58.047
especially Scotch.
- Jesus Christ.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.508
Here, throw it all away.

17:00.586 --> 17:03.555
Waste it all, fucking John D. Rockefeller!
Waste it all!

17:10.561 --> 17:11.824
Conserve.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.138
Where were you?

17:38.724 --> 17:42.387
I wanna know why there's zero growth
in this family's receipts.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.261
Where's the fucking money?

17:48.267 --> 17:52.067
You're supposed to be earners.
That's why you got the top-tier positions.

17:52.137 --> 17:55.538
So, everyone, go out to your people
on the street, crack some heads.

17:55.607 --> 17:57.837
Create some fucking earners out there.

18:03.482 --> 18:04.710
The guy...

18:04.783 --> 18:08.241
We talked about this,
over at the other place with the guy.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.421
The councilman.
What the fuck happened to that?

18:11.723 --> 18:13.452
It petered out.
- 'It petered out. '

18:13.525 --> 18:15.993
It died on the vine.
- 'It died on the vine. '

18:16.061 --> 18:19.224
It died on the vine.
The guy, he moved or something.

18:19.298 --> 18:21.926
Nobody knows
what the fuck I'm talking about!

18:26.238 --> 18:27.637
We hear you.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.244
My uncle...

18:35.447 --> 18:37.278
the boss of this family...

18:37.349 --> 18:39.374
is on trial for his life.

18:40.018 --> 18:43.385
And what you people are
kicking up to him is a fucking disgrace.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.722
You know how much lawyers cost?

18:47.926 --> 18:51.259
A major RICO like his,
I'm the only one supporting him.

18:52.331 --> 18:55.391
This thing is a pyramid,
since time immemorial.

18:55.834 --> 18:59.133
Shit runs downhill, money goes up.
It's that simple.

18:59.571 --> 19:01.971
I should not have to be coming here...

19:02.207 --> 19:03.697
hat in my hand...

19:04.409 --> 19:06.934
reminding you about your duty to that man.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.716
And I don't wanna hear about
the fucking economy either!

19:12.851 --> 19:14.944
SiI, break it down for them.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.146
What two businesses have traditionally
been recessión proof...

19:18.223 --> 19:19.815
since time immemorial?

19:20.526 --> 19:22.960
Certain aspects of show business,
and our thing.

19:24.029 --> 19:26.429
Now, that's it, that's all I got to say.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.796
Frankly, I'm depressed and ashamed.

19:44.950 --> 19:48.408
Is that what your coach laid out for you
as a training breakfast?

19:56.828 --> 19:59.353
The shelf in the garage is still loose.

20:00.566 --> 20:03.729
You went down in the garage?
I'm gonna go check it out.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.995
You said you'd wake up early,
come to church with me...

20:08.073 --> 20:10.132
then go online and register for your classes.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.040
I'll miss Grandma and Grandpa at dinner.

20:12.110 --> 20:14.408
There's a back-to-school party for Hadley.

21:09.668 --> 21:11.568
These boring Sunday dinners.

21:12.237 --> 21:14.102
Can one of my new friends eat over?

21:14.172 --> 21:18.074
Aunt Ro and Uncle Ralph will be here, too,
but I'm sure we can fit.

21:18.143 --> 21:20.873
You're not gonna lay out, Dad?
- It's too cold.

21:21.747 --> 21:24.545
Ralphie and Ro are coming out here today?

21:24.716 --> 21:27.480
I thought we got that straightened out
months ago.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.179
And it's not 'Uncle Ralph. '

21:29.254 --> 21:32.815
I asked you about inviting them
the other night, and you said...

21:33.458 --> 21:36.086
I must've been focused on something else.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.995
It's Ro's birthday, and she's very down.

21:47.572 --> 21:48.834
Anthony.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.768
I ever tell you about the time I had a Harley?

21:51.843 --> 21:55.210
Whoa, cool.
- '74 Shovelhead.

21:55.447 --> 21:59.076
I could blow off Porsches on that thing.
- Not my dad's Boxster.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.675
What's your name?
- Matt.

22:00.986 --> 22:04.888
Matt, no offense, but your dad's
Boxster is a Porsche with panties.

22:06.191 --> 22:07.783
He knows what I'm saying.

22:07.859 --> 22:10.327
I mean, that's for the Hamptons, the Boxster.

22:10.395 --> 22:12.522
I'm talking Turbo Carrera.

22:12.764 --> 22:16.131
One time, I'm alongside this Turbo
with doctor plates.

22:16.268 --> 22:19.237
We come off the line,
he's got this big Jew grin.

22:19.304 --> 22:20.737
You're not Jewish are you?

22:20.806 --> 22:23.036
Half.
- Anyway, he knows it's all in fun.

22:23.108 --> 22:25.702
At the Passaic Avenue
and New Dutch Lane intersection...

22:25.777 --> 22:28.940
we're doing 110. Boom!
Right through the light.

22:29.147 --> 22:31.047
He wasn't grinning then, boy.

22:31.116 --> 22:33.880
I look back. He's white as false teeth.

22:35.921 --> 22:38.549
Jason Mingelli's parents
let him get a YZ-250.

22:38.724 --> 22:42.524
You get on that bike, I will cut
your legs off before the bike does.

22:42.594 --> 22:46.587
I had the high handlebars, you know.
- Bruce Dern, don't you have to go?

22:46.665 --> 22:48.997
I got to hit the little boy's room.

22:49.267 --> 22:51.201
You guys need some help?

22:51.269 --> 22:55.365
In my day, there was a motorcycle
called the Vincent Black Shadow.

22:55.674 --> 22:58.871
Boy, did that thing take off.
- The hoods all drove those.

22:58.944 --> 23:02.072
They beat you up that time,
you remember, on City Island?

23:02.180 --> 23:05.877
He'd just gotten out of the Navy.
I think he weighed 105 pounds.

23:06.618 --> 23:08.643
Did you see any action
in World War II, Hugh?

23:08.720 --> 23:11.746
A little bit. I was stationed in Nova Scotia.

23:12.023 --> 23:15.959
But I caught diverticulitis.
It's the weight loss she's talking about.

23:16.027 --> 23:18.188
Oh, my God, you're eating, I'm so sorry.

23:18.263 --> 23:20.857
Don't worry about it, come in.
- You want something?

23:20.932 --> 23:22.365
No, my God, thank you.

23:22.434 --> 23:25.926
I just came over to borrow the samovar
for my cousin's baby shower.

23:27.172 --> 23:31.074
This is my friend, Danielle Ciccolella.
This is Christopher's cousin Tony.

23:31.143 --> 23:32.701
Tony.
- How you doing?

23:36.548 --> 23:38.072
His cousin Carmela.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.414
This is a beautiful home.
- Thank you.

23:42.387 --> 23:43.979
Where you from, Danielle?

23:44.055 --> 23:46.046
Whippany.
- Want some anisette?

23:46.191 --> 23:47.556
No, thanks.

23:48.126 --> 23:49.388
This thing needs polishing.

23:52.597 --> 23:55.657
There's a bathroom downstairs.
- It's me, Janice.

23:57.235 --> 23:59.760
There's a bathroom downstairs.
- I know.

24:05.977 --> 24:06.966
What?

24:07.279 --> 24:08.906
What are you doing?
- Nothing.

24:10.382 --> 24:11.406
Come on.

24:11.483 --> 24:12.882
I knew it.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.181
Go ahead, you can do that.

24:22.527 --> 24:24.392
How's Ro doing down there?

24:24.463 --> 24:26.988
Very quiet, you know, it's to be expected.

24:27.966 --> 24:31.129
They got her on medication.
I don't think it's helping.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.467
'Ah, Bartleby! Ah, humanity!'

24:34.473 --> 24:37.033
Danielle, did you see the loggia?

24:37.809 --> 24:40.869
That loggia was my daughter's idea.

24:41.446 --> 24:42.777
Nice?

24:44.416 --> 24:45.678
Danielle, come check this out.

24:56.127 --> 24:57.116
Come on.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.321
What are you doing to me here?

25:13.678 --> 25:15.509
I was stationed in Nova Scotia.

25:16.481 --> 25:18.210
Well, I told you that.

25:18.583 --> 25:21.950
Anyway, there was nothing for them
to do in Nova Scotia.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.012
Great seafood, but other than that...

25:42.073 --> 25:43.973
That's a lot of cracked corn.

25:44.342 --> 25:47.106
All the ducks,
they've flown south for the winter.

25:47.178 --> 25:49.612
So? I'll be ready for next season.

25:50.815 --> 25:52.043
Thanks.

25:52.517 --> 25:55.111
Red Suburban. I'll be over at Italianissimo.

26:01.793 --> 26:03.522
Good news about the Esplanade.

26:03.595 --> 26:07.361
The legislature's voted to refund the
special Newark development district...

26:07.432 --> 26:10.595
along Frelinghuysen Avenue,
north from the Museum of Trucking.

26:10.769 --> 26:14.068
Because of the vote, Omni is gonna
put up a hotel with a galleria...

26:14.139 --> 26:16.437
on the first floor.
Word came down yesterday.

26:16.508 --> 26:17.839
A galleria?

26:18.209 --> 26:20.803
Fifty stores selling
sneakers and turnip greens.

26:20.879 --> 26:23.848
It's a demographic imperative.
Hoboken's maxed out.

26:23.915 --> 26:26.440
Your Prada people are already
moving to Down Neck.

26:26.518 --> 26:28.418
Where are they gonna go next?

26:29.688 --> 26:32.486
My old man had a piece of
the garbage transfer station...

26:32.557 --> 26:34.491
in Lower Manhattan, back in the '70s.

26:34.559 --> 26:35.890
People told him:

26:35.961 --> 26:38.555
'Start buying up
the abandoned buildings around here. '

26:38.630 --> 26:41.292
But he couldn't see it.
- And now it's TriBeCa.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.697
I tell you, Tony...

26:43.768 --> 26:47.226
I'm borrowing money myself to grab up
parcels along Frelinghuysen Ave...

26:47.305 --> 26:50.297
through a shell company.
And a private citizen like you?

26:50.375 --> 26:53.674
Who's gonna quibble
with patriotic entrepreneurism?

26:55.447 --> 26:58.075
My uncle has property
down on Frelinghuysen.

27:01.186 --> 27:02.653
Mr. Soprano.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.355
I remember you

27:06.091 --> 27:08.992
You're the one that
made my dreams come true

27:09.160 --> 27:10.718
a few kisses ago

27:10.795 --> 27:11.784
Oh, boy.

27:15.767 --> 27:18.258
I'm gonna be busy the next couple months.

27:18.336 --> 27:20.395
But after that, what would you say...

27:21.139 --> 27:22.128
me and you...

27:22.207 --> 27:25.370
una bella giornata, to that
city called Atlantic?

27:25.877 --> 27:28.812
I have many dear friends there.
I could show you quite a time.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.872
Thank you, but I don't gamble.
- With me, it's never a gamble.

27:31.950 --> 27:33.918
You know, today is my last day.

27:33.985 --> 27:36.283
Where you going?
- Back to school.

27:36.454 --> 27:39.287
Anyway, I'll come say goodbye
when you're done here.

27:43.061 --> 27:44.050
Excuse me.

27:47.632 --> 27:49.623
All the fucking luck.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.663
So, what is it today?

27:52.871 --> 27:54.429
It's becoming clear to me...

27:54.506 --> 27:56.997
Murf can't run my operations
while I'm in court.

27:57.075 --> 28:00.067
He's starting to forget things. His words...

28:00.745 --> 28:04.340
Sometimes there's food on the
front of his shirt, the poor bastard.

28:05.817 --> 28:07.785
I'm gonna move Bobby up.

28:08.753 --> 28:12.052
I think it's a good choice.
- I wasn't asking, I'm telling.

28:12.490 --> 28:15.050
So you know who to talk to.
- Bobby know yet?

28:16.227 --> 28:19.958
I think we should bring him in here.
He's gonna be a very happy man.

29:07.879 --> 29:11.906
Thought you were at the beauty parlor.
- I'm going to get the last of the tomatoes.

29:12.584 --> 29:16.486
Yeah, they were good last night.
- A little late in the season for ducks, no?

29:16.821 --> 29:21.155
Not necessarily. The ones from
upper Canada, this is the south to them.

29:47.552 --> 29:50.612
Speak.
- I have a collect call for Mr. Walters.

29:51.055 --> 29:52.613
Okay, operator.

29:53.091 --> 29:54.080
John?

29:54.259 --> 29:55.749
Right on time.

29:56.194 --> 29:58.321
That's all I got, paI, time.

29:59.497 --> 30:01.727
What the fuck happened out there?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.495
Didn't Tony tell you? Sil?

30:04.002 --> 30:07.961
They mentioned in passing that you were
doing the county book in Youngstown.

30:08.039 --> 30:09.529
Didn't have long to talk.

30:13.111 --> 30:14.100
Hello?

30:14.546 --> 30:17.344
Let me first say,
I can't tell you how touched I was...

30:17.415 --> 30:20.179
when my nephew told me
you wanted me to call.

30:20.251 --> 30:22.378
Anthony only talks to me
through middlemen.

30:23.288 --> 30:26.189
So, what did they pinch you for?
- Gun charge.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.992
I drove out to visit Lenny Scotise.

30:29.127 --> 30:30.617
Don't know if you know Lenny.

30:30.695 --> 30:33.664
Him and I used to have that little club-
- Doesn't matter.

30:33.731 --> 30:35.699
Anyway, my first night here...

30:35.767 --> 30:38.895
we drive out to visit
Dean Martin's birthplace in Steubenville.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.734
Cops pull us over for no left blinker.

30:41.806 --> 30:44.969
Long story short,
they find a piece under the seat.

30:45.043 --> 30:46.476
Fucking. 38.

30:46.845 --> 30:50.440
Turns out it was used in an unsolved
murder out here from eight years ago.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.449
Jesus.
- Yeah.

30:53.351 --> 30:54.875
So what can I do to help?

30:54.953 --> 30:56.545
You're too much. Nothing.

30:56.621 --> 30:59.488
The lawyer said they'll keep us here
as long as they can...

30:59.557 --> 31:02.253
till they make their case,
or unless somebody cops to it.

31:02.327 --> 31:03.555
Keep your dick up.

31:03.628 --> 31:07.621
Well, I... Leave that. Don't touch that,
my program's coming on.

31:08.499 --> 31:11.400
John, love you, babe. Don't let me rot, now.

31:24.916 --> 31:27.077
Turns out I gotta work tonight.
- I see.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.086
You see what?

31:29.554 --> 31:31.249
You're so concerned about finances...

31:31.322 --> 31:33.552
where do you think it comes from?

31:34.025 --> 31:35.424
Be careful driving home.

31:42.867 --> 31:44.334
There he is!

31:44.969 --> 31:47.301
Here's to Newark's newest hotel.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.641
Anything else with the Esplanade
I should know?

31:55.947 --> 31:56.914
No.

31:56.981 --> 31:59.415
It's the girls from Icelandic Air!

32:00.351 --> 32:01.716
Come on in!

32:04.756 --> 32:06.383
Hey, how are you?

32:07.525 --> 32:10.221
All right, let me get the fuck out of here.

32:10.962 --> 32:12.429
How's Junior?

32:12.530 --> 32:15.863
He's gonna be all right.
- Tell him he's in our prayers, etc.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.164
I'll be sure to let him know.

32:18.303 --> 32:19.668
One other thing, though.

32:19.737 --> 32:22.297
John said he went to a cookout
at your house.

32:23.041 --> 32:25.100
A don doesn't wear shorts.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.272
All right, come on.

32:27.345 --> 32:28.937
Elevator's here.

32:34.886 --> 32:36.410
So where are you girls from?

32:36.487 --> 32:37.476
Reykjavik.

32:37.555 --> 32:39.682
You do and you'll clean it up.

33:29.607 --> 33:32.132
Christopher!
- Yeah!

33:32.210 --> 33:33.507
Let's go!

33:44.122 --> 33:45.612
What's up, T?

34:08.780 --> 34:10.475
You have a good time tonight?

34:10.547 --> 34:11.913
All right.

34:12.417 --> 34:13.975
Learn anything?

34:14.418 --> 34:15.784
Like what?

34:16.987 --> 34:18.250
Anything.

34:18.755 --> 34:21.246
You had a sit-down with two bosses.

34:21.359 --> 34:23.657
You got a real hard-on for me,
that's all I know.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.458
You think so?
- It's fucking obvious.

34:27.532 --> 34:28.829
Take the parkway.

34:28.900 --> 34:32.802
You know, for all the things there are
to eat on this island...

34:32.969 --> 34:37.100
breadfruit, mangoes, papayas,
not to mention the fish in the sea...

34:38.509 --> 34:42.001
there's no question about us surviving.
We could go on here for years.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.741
And I mean years.

34:45.382 --> 34:47.078
Where are you going?

34:49.520 --> 34:50.817
Get that.

34:54.792 --> 34:55.952
Hello?

34:59.530 --> 35:00.588
Who did?

35:02.867 --> 35:04.129
They did?

35:06.204 --> 35:07.728
I'll tell him.

35:10.007 --> 35:11.372
Tell me what?

35:12.076 --> 35:14.704
That was Melvoin.
- So, it was Melvoin.

35:15.346 --> 35:18.577
What the fuck is this, Mother May I?
Go ahead, tell me!

35:18.649 --> 35:21.447
He just had a call from some source of his.

35:21.519 --> 35:23.714
Dr. Schreck's office isn't safe to talk at.

35:23.788 --> 35:26.951
The FBI had an undercover in there
since January.

35:27.758 --> 35:29.623
Or D-day or something.

35:30.094 --> 35:33.291
The agent's been pulled
to testify at your trial.

35:41.539 --> 35:43.769
All right, pull up over there.

36:04.128 --> 36:05.925
Who's that, Bobby Bacala?

36:05.997 --> 36:07.555
See over there?

36:12.637 --> 36:14.935
Guy in there killed your father.

36:16.440 --> 36:18.965
What the fuck are you talking about?

36:20.778 --> 36:22.245
Barry Haydu.

36:23.481 --> 36:26.678
Detective Lieutenant
in the Clifton Police Force.

36:27.351 --> 36:28.841
Retired today.

36:29.687 --> 36:31.814
That's his retirement party.

36:39.997 --> 36:42.932
Everybody always told me
it was a fucking cop.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.865
I thought he was dead.

36:45.002 --> 36:48.529
My mother can't even talk about it.
- Did the hit for Jilly Ruffalo.

36:48.606 --> 36:50.767
Him and your old man
were in the can together.

36:50.841 --> 36:53.469
Jilly stabbed your old man's cellmate
to death.

36:53.544 --> 36:56.945
So, when your old man got paroled,
he tracked down Jilly.

36:57.014 --> 37:00.711
Took out his eye so bad,
he couldn't even put a glass one in.

37:00.851 --> 37:02.648
LoyaI, your old man.

37:05.189 --> 37:06.952
That's what I heard.

37:07.692 --> 37:09.250
Some guy's eye.

37:10.728 --> 37:13.697
They hit my dad
right outside my house, right?

37:15.199 --> 37:18.259
He was bringing home a crib for me?
- Yeah.

37:21.172 --> 37:22.571
Well, no...

37:22.940 --> 37:25.568
He was outside the house,
but he wasn't carrying a crib.

37:25.643 --> 37:27.736
He had a bunch of TV trays.

37:27.979 --> 37:30.277
Could've been a crib just as easily.

37:32.583 --> 37:34.881
That rat fuck was in uniform then.

37:34.952 --> 37:37.420
Gambled like you wouldn't believe.

37:38.489 --> 37:40.389
He did it on contract.

37:40.458 --> 37:42.585
Made a lot of money over the years.

37:42.660 --> 37:45.424
So, how come he's still fucking walking?

37:45.796 --> 37:48.697
Because he's been useful.
But he's outlived it...

37:48.766 --> 37:51.735
as of his cute little ceremony this afternoon.

37:51.802 --> 37:53.235
Is that him?

37:53.771 --> 37:55.602
With the sombrero on?

37:56.574 --> 37:58.769
No, you can't tell from here.

37:59.977 --> 38:01.774
Maybe...

38:02.613 --> 38:04.137
Yeah, probably.

38:10.855 --> 38:11.913
Here.

38:15.092 --> 38:16.821
Nice house, apparently.

38:16.894 --> 38:19.089
They say he paid cash for it.

38:19.230 --> 38:20.561
Good luck.

38:24.902 --> 38:26.233
Questions?

38:32.810 --> 38:34.573
Kill the dome light.

39:23.694 --> 39:24.683
Said, 'Hey, Joe'

39:31.168 --> 39:33.728
That's the lamest plan I ever heard.

39:33.804 --> 39:36.898
It is not a lame plan,
we got it all worked out.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.507
And we got the time to place everything.

39:40.578 --> 39:41.875
It's lame.

39:42.079 --> 39:44.912
Magnum, why are you being
so negative and hostile?

39:44.982 --> 39:48.042
Higgins, he's one of the biggest
drug dealers in the Midwest...

39:48.119 --> 39:49.848
and he's as dangerous as Quenneville...

39:49.920 --> 39:51.319
What the fuck is this?

39:51.389 --> 39:54.381
You're cleaned out.
Nothing to rob in this place.

39:55.292 --> 39:57.021
Well, there's this.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.052
Okay.

40:02.032 --> 40:04.227
You know I'm a police officer.

40:05.936 --> 40:09.030
Engraving on this watch
says you retired today.

40:15.946 --> 40:17.846
Every little bit helps.

40:21.552 --> 40:23.042
Rough divorce?

40:24.922 --> 40:26.947
She must be a real vile twat.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.758
Hope she didn't pass it on to your daughter.

40:31.829 --> 40:33.319
Listen to me.

40:35.065 --> 40:37.659
It's not too late to cut your losses.

40:37.835 --> 40:39.496
Unlock me, give me the weapons.

40:39.570 --> 40:43.006
I promise you I will do
whatever is in my power to help you.

40:43.073 --> 40:45.371
Maybe. Let's come back to that.

40:49.980 --> 40:52.346
You remember Dickie Moltisanti?

40:53.384 --> 40:54.749
No.
- No?

40:55.686 --> 40:57.381
Is that what you said?

40:59.256 --> 41:01.918
Is he a friend of yours?
- He was my father.

41:05.029 --> 41:07.020
Steak san, Newport fries?

41:08.332 --> 41:10.766
Scrambled eggs, no oiI, tomato slices.

41:24.782 --> 41:26.272
So, are you...

41:27.284 --> 41:29.616
mentally prepared for this promotion?

41:29.687 --> 41:30.949
Yeah.

41:34.525 --> 41:36.117
How's that steak?

41:37.261 --> 41:38.592
It's okay.

41:41.866 --> 41:44.528
Hon? Another steak san over here.

41:44.869 --> 41:46.496
Rare.
- Coming up.

41:49.874 --> 41:51.603
You know, because it's...

41:52.309 --> 41:54.834
It's a lot of added responsibility.

41:55.679 --> 41:58.273
I think it should've happened sooner.

42:00.885 --> 42:03.285
How's your family doing, you know...

42:03.354 --> 42:05.754
since the tragedy with your dad?

42:06.657 --> 42:08.386
Rough on my mother.

42:12.029 --> 42:13.826
How old is she now?

42:14.932 --> 42:16.194
She's 69.

42:19.670 --> 42:23.106
Mom really went downhill
after the World Trade Center.

42:24.074 --> 42:26.804
You know, Quasimodo predicted all this.

42:28.078 --> 42:29.204
Who did what?

42:29.280 --> 42:31.771
These problems.
The Middle East, the end of the world.

42:31.849 --> 42:33.282
Nostradamus.

42:33.918 --> 42:36.079
Quasimodo's the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

42:36.153 --> 42:37.211
Right.

42:37.288 --> 42:38.277
Notre Damus.

42:38.355 --> 42:41.290
Nostradamus, and Notre Dame.

42:42.192 --> 42:44.786
It's two different things completely.

42:49.333 --> 42:52.496
It's interesting, though,
they'd be so similar, isn't it?

42:52.570 --> 42:56.199
And I always thought,
'Okay, Hunchback of Notre Dame.

42:56.674 --> 42:59.472
'You also got your quarterback
and halfback of Notre Dame. '

42:59.543 --> 43:01.010
One's a fucking cathedral.

43:01.078 --> 43:03.273
Obviously. I know, I'm just saying.

43:03.347 --> 43:05.315
It's interesting, the coincidence.

43:05.382 --> 43:07.748
What, you gonna tell me
you never pondered that?

43:07.818 --> 43:10.343
The back thing with Notre Dame?
- No!

43:17.962 --> 43:22.194
Look, I don't know who told you I had
anything to do with your father's death...

43:22.266 --> 43:24.757
but their information is faulty...

43:24.835 --> 43:27.895
or they are deliberately
not telling you the truth.

43:27.972 --> 43:31.772
Are you inferring that
you didn't take cash from Jilly Ruffalo...

43:31.842 --> 43:36.142
to whack my father while he was carrying
a TV tray for me to watch TV?

43:36.213 --> 43:38.647
I don't know anybody named Ruffalo.

43:40.884 --> 43:42.647
You're being set up!

43:43.153 --> 43:45.747
He's Iying to you, whoever he is.

43:48.325 --> 43:49.758
It wouldn't make any difference.

43:49.827 --> 43:52.091
What do you mean,
it wouldn't make any difference?

43:52.162 --> 43:53.322
He wants you dead.

43:53.397 --> 43:55.922
All right, look. I got a boat.

43:56.166 --> 43:59.033
It's a Sea Ray 230. It's almost brand new.

43:59.136 --> 44:02.105
I didn't kill your father, but you could...

44:02.439 --> 44:04.999
You don't want a cop-kill on your head!

44:05.075 --> 44:07.134
...and what if they won't pull over, T.C.?

44:07.211 --> 44:10.009
I'm not gonna take on a limo in this car.

44:11.849 --> 44:13.714
No problem.
- I'm sorry!

44:18.822 --> 44:21.450
What are you gonna do?
- Honk the horn.

44:22.926 --> 44:24.621
Pull over! Police!

44:24.862 --> 44:27.296
Police, in a Ferrari?

44:37.675 --> 44:41.509
Freeze! Don't move a muscle,
or I'll put a bullet through it.

44:43.981 --> 44:47.178
Special Investigator Finaday,
you're under arrest.

44:47.551 --> 44:49.348
What's the charge, Officer?

44:49.420 --> 44:53.083
Speeding, reckless driving,
endangering another vehicle...

44:55.726 --> 44:57.455
and impersonating an officer.

44:57.528 --> 45:01.794
How do you think it's going?
- Couldn't be better, you two are terrific.

45:03.701 --> 45:06.898
Soon as they come through the door,
we're gonna nail them.

45:07.171 --> 45:08.365
Freeze!

45:08.639 --> 45:09.628
Shit.

45:13.310 --> 45:14.971
I missed my game, again.

45:15.045 --> 45:16.444
Fucking loser.

45:16.513 --> 45:18.743
Now Reese'll have to lead
the guys to victory.

45:18.816 --> 45:20.443
Who's Reese?
- Kenneth Reese!

45:20.517 --> 45:22.644
He was my back-up quarterback
at the academy...

45:22.720 --> 45:25.382
and he's been waiting
for a chance like this since 1963.

45:25.456 --> 45:26.787
Now he's got it because of you.

45:27.091 --> 45:29.184
...more than 12 hours. Ted?

45:29.493 --> 45:32.519
Amy, in Pennsylvania tonight,
two men were shot and killed...

45:32.596 --> 45:36.430
in what was described as a brazen
but successful armored-car robbery.

45:36.500 --> 45:39.162
Three accomplices escaped with $800,000...

45:39.236 --> 45:42.637
while one of the dead men,
Dennis Lynch of Freehold, New Jersey...

45:42.706 --> 45:45.675
was said by police to have ties
to organized crime families...

45:45.743 --> 45:47.643
both in that city and in New York.

45:47.711 --> 45:49.645
The street where the robbery took place...

45:49.713 --> 45:51.874
was littered with bills
of denominations from...

45:53.650 --> 45:56.813
You smell gas down here?
- It's always like that.

45:56.887 --> 45:58.616
You had the pipes checked?

45:59.757 --> 46:01.884
I thought I heard something.

46:02.826 --> 46:04.726
Is he up? I need to talk to him.

46:04.795 --> 46:07.457
I brought him a steak.
You can put it with eggs.

46:07.531 --> 46:11.023
Actually, your wife's here.
She's making him something to eat.

46:11.101 --> 46:13.092
Karen. Did something happen?

46:13.437 --> 46:15.769
We got some bad news last night.

46:17.007 --> 46:19.066
Are you just gonna stand there?

46:19.143 --> 46:23.102
The Feds had an undercover agent
in Dr. Schreck's office.

46:30.354 --> 46:31.787
Uncle Jun'.

46:32.122 --> 46:34.955
Hey, Karen.
- Fucking Grand Central Station?

46:35.025 --> 46:36.754
Junior, my kids?

46:37.594 --> 46:39.721
You're right. Sorry, dear.

46:39.797 --> 46:41.765
I brought my bar of soap.

46:41.865 --> 46:43.662
What time they call you?

46:43.734 --> 46:47.500
We had a little scare.
Thought it was the shunt in his heart.

46:47.571 --> 46:50.233
He passed some gas, and he seems better.

46:50.307 --> 46:53.902
Why don't you go on Joe Franklin,
tell the whole tri-state area?

46:55.345 --> 46:56.334
Dad.

46:57.915 --> 46:59.177
Not now.

46:59.249 --> 47:01.046
I heard what happened.

47:01.118 --> 47:04.417
It's bad, but it's not worth
getting yourself sick over.

47:05.088 --> 47:07.921
I told you, just sit down.
- He doesn't have cable.

47:10.194 --> 47:11.718
Actually, we're gonna go.

47:11.795 --> 47:14.161
Okay, Jun', you got everything?

47:14.598 --> 47:17.089
Thank you, dear, you've been wonderful.

47:17.167 --> 47:18.464
Bye, Karen.

47:18.535 --> 47:20.662
I'll see you. See you, kids.

47:20.838 --> 47:22.396
Goodbye, Karen.
- Be good.

47:25.042 --> 47:27.374
Must've been that piece of tail.

47:33.517 --> 47:35.212
Now, look, she...

47:36.687 --> 47:38.678
She probably reported the meetings...

47:38.755 --> 47:40.985
who was there, all that shit.

47:42.759 --> 47:44.818
As far as conversations,
what could she hear?

47:44.895 --> 47:46.556
You'd better hope nothing...

47:46.630 --> 47:49.690
because you were involved
in every fucking one.

47:52.870 --> 47:56.499
How could you fall for that flirty shit?
That's the point!

47:59.776 --> 48:03.007
Get the hell outta here.
I wanna talk to my uncle.

48:07.517 --> 48:11.681
Forget about that for a minute.
That shit about your legal expenses.

48:12.923 --> 48:15.483
I been thinking, and okay.

48:17.094 --> 48:19.528
Maybe I can give you some relief.

48:19.897 --> 48:20.989
What?

48:22.332 --> 48:25.563
You got that empty garage
over on Frelinghuysen Avenue.

48:25.636 --> 48:28.332
You been trying to sell it.
I'll take it off your hands.

48:28.405 --> 48:32.398
What are you gonna do with it?
- I don't know, I'm trying to help you out.

48:32.643 --> 48:33.871
How much?

48:35.612 --> 48:36.909
$100,000.

48:39.950 --> 48:41.474
Who gives a fuck anyway?

48:41.551 --> 48:44.349
Come on.
- I was led around by the nose, Anthony.

48:44.421 --> 48:48.653
You're right. A young cooze smiled at me,
and birds started chirping.

48:49.126 --> 48:52.618
Time was, my instincts would've never
failed me like that.

48:52.696 --> 48:54.994
So, what are you now, the Amazing Kreskin?

48:55.065 --> 48:56.828
What did I tell her?

48:56.900 --> 48:59.266
Did I say anything
could be used against me?

48:59.336 --> 49:00.735
I don't know.

49:00.804 --> 49:02.999
Bullshitting, singing.

49:03.240 --> 49:05.367
Atlantic City, Jesus Christ.

49:06.677 --> 49:10.135
I'll be sitting right across from her
in the courtroom.

49:18.088 --> 49:20.750
All right, come on. Have something to eat.

49:24.461 --> 49:26.429
I'm an old man, Anthony.

49:28.065 --> 49:30.465
An old man that's going to trial.

49:32.202 --> 49:34.170
Not much else to say about me.

49:53.590 --> 49:55.217
I'm a little depressed.

49:57.894 --> 49:59.293
You were on vacation.

49:59.363 --> 50:01.593
Can you describe the feelings?

50:01.932 --> 50:03.524
Things are good.

50:05.369 --> 50:07.337
Especially with Carmela.

50:09.106 --> 50:11.939
But then she starts ragging on me
about the future.

50:12.009 --> 50:13.670
How she's worried.

50:14.344 --> 50:16.574
And what's gonna happen to them
if I'm dead.

50:16.646 --> 50:19.012
And 'buy bonds' and all this shit.

50:19.182 --> 50:21.707
A lot of people are feeling vulnerable.

50:21.785 --> 50:24.276
On the other hand, she's right.

50:25.055 --> 50:27.956
Not that I'd ever tell her that.
- Why not?

50:28.925 --> 50:31.723
'Cause then she'd wanna know
where's the money, how much.

50:31.795 --> 50:34.093
Don't you want Carmela to be taken care of?

50:34.164 --> 50:35.324
She is.

50:35.932 --> 50:37.797
Anyway, she's right, that's the point.

50:37.868 --> 50:40.598
Over the last few years,
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

50:40.670 --> 50:41.659
And?

50:41.872 --> 50:44.306
My uncle definitely snapped it into focus.

50:44.374 --> 50:47.036
What's he, 72 years old? What's he got?

50:47.110 --> 50:50.375
Fucking shitty house in Belleville,
and a bunch of legal bills...

50:50.447 --> 50:53.348
that'd make you gargle Drano
if you had them.

50:53.550 --> 50:55.177
I've analyzed it.

50:56.686 --> 50:58.881
There's two endings for a guy like me.

50:58.955 --> 51:00.582
High-profile guy.

51:01.124 --> 51:02.921
Dead, or in the can.

51:03.126 --> 51:05.959
Big percent of the time.
- You've never talked this frankly.

51:06.029 --> 51:09.624
Even with all this terrorism shit,
the government has resources up the ass.

51:09.699 --> 51:12.065
As far as legal bills are-
- Anthony!

51:12.135 --> 51:14.194
What?
- Why don't you give it up?

51:17.174 --> 51:19.199
You didn't let me finish.

51:19.443 --> 51:21.877
There's a third way to wrap it up.

51:22.913 --> 51:24.881
You rely only on family.

51:25.082 --> 51:29.018
Not many men could survive
without the love and support...

51:29.086 --> 51:31.179
of their wife and children.

51:31.254 --> 51:33.484
No, I'm talking about business.

51:33.557 --> 51:35.388
You trust only blood.

51:39.396 --> 51:41.125
A friend of mine...

51:41.231 --> 51:43.324
guy whose name you wouldn't know...

51:43.400 --> 51:45.265
stayed out of the can and in charge.

51:45.335 --> 51:49.601
Lived in Florida till he was 81 years old.
He only gave orders through his son.

51:51.441 --> 51:55.002
No other conversations
that could come back in testimony.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.880
His son?
- No, not A.J.

51:59.282 --> 52:01.716
What I've been dealt is my nephew.

52:02.919 --> 52:05.513
He's gotten his act together, the kid.

52:07.357 --> 52:08.824
Over the last few months...

52:08.892 --> 52:12.384
I started the process
of bonding him to me inseparably.

52:13.096 --> 52:14.085
How?

52:14.631 --> 52:16.292
That we can't get into.

52:16.366 --> 52:18.300
Didn't your uncle do that with you?

52:18.368 --> 52:22.134
You said his life is like a desert.

52:22.205 --> 52:25.299
I'm 42, and I'm already more successfuI
than my uncle ever was.

52:25.375 --> 52:27.036
You've seen my house.

52:29.746 --> 52:32.374
Anthony, why are you telling me this?

52:39.656 --> 52:41.123
I don't know.

52:42.559 --> 52:45.392
Guess I trust you.

52:47.898 --> 52:49.195
A little.

53:16.593 --> 53:17.855
Hi, Mom.

53:19.629 --> 53:22.860
What the hell are you doing here?
You scared me to death.

53:22.933 --> 53:25.527
Just stopped by
to see how you're getting along.

53:25.602 --> 53:29.299
You ever do anything like a normal person?
There is a bell.

53:31.841 --> 53:33.308
How you been?

53:33.743 --> 53:34.835
Fine.

53:36.780 --> 53:38.407
How's Connie's kid?

53:38.481 --> 53:39.812
He's huge.

53:40.850 --> 53:42.044
Jesus!

53:43.753 --> 53:45.220
That's Jason?

53:46.690 --> 53:49.853
He has a weight problem already.
Eight years old.

53:49.926 --> 53:53.418
She never had him baptized.
She thought she knew everything.

53:53.496 --> 53:57.660
Actually, I was hoping you would make me
one of your fluffernutters.

54:01.871 --> 54:03.771
It's fucking mouthwash.

54:03.940 --> 54:07.637
Leave me the fuck alone.
You come over here with that shit.

54:13.783 --> 54:16.877
What's that on the table,
Daddy's navy picture?

54:17.554 --> 54:19.283
You ever miss him?

54:21.157 --> 54:23.022
When he was in prison...

54:23.393 --> 54:25.361
or since he's been dead?

54:27.297 --> 54:28.764
I don't know.

54:33.637 --> 54:36.128
Did I saddle you with a stepfather?

54:48.351 --> 54:52.219
I don't have any peanut butter.
I haven't kept it since you left.

54:52.289 --> 54:54.689
I can't make you a fluffernutter.

54:55.225 --> 54:57.125
You want French toast?

54:59.696 --> 55:01.061
I gotta go.

55:05.602 --> 55:08.594
Ade sends her love.
- Right, say hello.

55:11.041 --> 55:14.067
You watch that Bailey's,
or I'll give you a shot in the head.

55:14.144 --> 55:15.873
Look who's talking.
- What?

55:15.945 --> 55:17.537
Never mind what.
