00:01.742 --> 00:03.966
- You let a billionaire
hospital trustee die

00:03.967 --> 00:05.726
To save some kid off the street.

00:05.727 --> 00:07.694
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

00:07.695 --> 00:09.104
- This trip is gonna
get you back on your feet.

00:09.105 --> 00:11.153
- What trip?
- To the Hamptons.

00:11.154 --> 00:12.826
Is this an arranged marriage?
- Yes.

00:12.827 --> 00:15.251
- I know many couples who got
married deeply in love.

00:15.252 --> 00:16.642
Now they barely speak.

00:16.643 --> 00:18.982
- Well, you sound
so terribly excited

00:18.983 --> 00:19.984
About this marriage.

00:19.985 --> 00:21.388
- Welcome to Cuba.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.825
Dr. Casseras
has diagnosed me, Hank.

00:22.826 --> 00:24.361
- Is Boris in
a long-distance relationship?

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:39.261 --> 00:40.829
- Open wide.

00:40.830 --> 00:42.233
Mmm. Yummy.

00:42.234 --> 00:43.734
Extra ketchup.

00:43.735 --> 00:45.470
Who loves Ginnie?

00:45.471 --> 00:47.339
oh, yeah, I know.

00:47.340 --> 00:48.841
You love this.
It's your favorite.

00:48.842 --> 00:50.978
Daddy's home.

00:50.979 --> 00:52.380
Dinner's almost ready, Roy.

00:52.381 --> 00:55.287
- We won.

00:55.288 --> 00:56.955
We won the lottery.

00:56.956 --> 00:59.046
- Are you serious?
Are you serious?

01:00.649 --> 01:01.984
You can't be serious!

01:07.429 --> 01:09.597
- Roy?

01:09.598 --> 01:12.067
Oh, my God, baby.
What's happening?

01:12.068 --> 01:14.904
Baby, talk to me.

01:16.708 --> 01:19.210
- Wha...
you are evil!

01:19.211 --> 01:20.277
Do you know that?

01:20.278 --> 01:21.679
Why did I even marry you?

01:21.680 --> 01:23.882
- 'cause you knew someday
I'd be a very rich man.

01:23.883 --> 01:25.017
- Yes, I did!

01:25.018 --> 01:27.554
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:27.555 --> 01:31.459
Roy, what are we gonna
buy first?

01:34.096 --> 01:36.998
We're still working on filling
all this space.

01:36.999 --> 01:38.700
- Yeah, can I make
a suggestion?

01:38.701 --> 01:41.470
How about a regulation
basketball court right here?

01:41.471 --> 01:43.572
- I know.
It's huge, right?

01:44.774 --> 01:46.609
- It's as big as the price tag.

01:46.610 --> 01:47.910
How you guys doing?

01:47.911 --> 01:48.978
- Hey.
- What's up?

01:48.979 --> 01:50.446
- Still pinching pennies.

01:50.447 --> 01:53.149
The man helped the movers
unload our stuff.

01:53.150 --> 01:54.417
Who does that?

01:54.418 --> 01:55.718
- They were charging
by the hour.

01:55.719 --> 01:56.919
They were taking
their sweet time.

01:56.920 --> 01:58.655
- Is that how you hurt
your wrist?

01:58.656 --> 02:00.857
- I had worse than this driving
a truck for 14 years,

02:00.858 --> 02:02.860
But I never called in sick,
not one day.

02:02.861 --> 02:03.961
- Never.

02:03.962 --> 02:05.730
Always, always on the road,

02:05.731 --> 02:07.765
So now you're gonna relax
if it kills me.

02:07.766 --> 02:09.567
- So, um, how can I help?

02:09.568 --> 02:11.870
- It's this hideous rash.

02:11.871 --> 02:15.107
I-I... I can't face
the neighbors like this.

02:15.108 --> 02:16.908
I mean, these are the Hamptons.

02:16.909 --> 02:18.510
- No, no.
It's singular.

02:18.511 --> 02:19.778
This is the Hamptons.

02:19.779 --> 02:21.213
It's a mistake a I used
to make all the time.

02:21.214 --> 02:22.247
It's a big tell.

02:22.248 --> 02:23.682
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

02:23.683 --> 02:26.619
- They're gonna think we brought
the plague or something.

02:26.620 --> 02:28.421
- I can definitely
rule out plague.

02:28.422 --> 02:30.090
- Evan r. Lawson.
I'm the CFO of hankmed.

02:30.091 --> 02:31.258
- Hey.

02:31.259 --> 02:32.626
- Is this new jewelry?

02:32.627 --> 02:35.197
- I bought a whole set on our
trip from north Dakota.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.565
One of a kind.
- Really?

02:36.566 --> 02:37.800
- Right, honey?

02:37.801 --> 02:39.302
- Oh, sure, babe.

02:39.303 --> 02:41.069
- Uh, yeah,
I think you're having

02:41.070 --> 02:43.370
An allergic reaction to it.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.339
- I've never had
real gold before.

02:45.340 --> 02:47.975
I had no idea I was allergic.

02:47.976 --> 02:50.211
- Actually, we still don't know
that you are

02:50.212 --> 02:51.546
Allergic to real gold.

02:51.547 --> 02:54.749
- Honey, he's saying
it's not real.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.050
They saw her coming
a mile away.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.151
- Oh, yeah.

02:57.152 --> 02:59.420
- This is hydrocortisone.

02:59.421 --> 03:02.490
Use it on the rash twice
a day until it's gone, okay?

03:02.491 --> 03:04.792
- Okay.
I can do that.

03:04.793 --> 03:07.795
- All right, well, CFO...

03:07.796 --> 03:09.097
What do I owe you?

03:09.098 --> 03:10.265
- Oh, no, no.
We'll bill you.

03:10.266 --> 03:11.566
Yeah, we'll bill you.
- Okay.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.334
- "citizen's bank of bowbells."

03:13.335 --> 03:15.203
Nice.

03:15.204 --> 03:17.872
You didn't put all your money
in one bank, right?

03:19.541 --> 03:21.509
- You didn't, right?

03:21.510 --> 03:23.745
okay, dude.

03:23.746 --> 03:27.215
You need financial planning
assistance, like, bad,

03:27.216 --> 03:29.884
And I can't in good conscience
allow you to go on like this.

03:29.885 --> 03:31.852
It's crazy.
- Okay, okay.

03:31.853 --> 03:33.587
How much do you want
for the conscience?

03:35.190 --> 03:36.624
- You know, you're new in town.

03:36.625 --> 03:37.758
I'll give you the discounted
rate, if you want.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.026
- Ok.

03:39.027 --> 03:40.261
- It should clear up in
a couple of days.

03:40.262 --> 03:42.863
If not, call me.
- Oh, thank goodness.

03:42.864 --> 03:44.298
We're renewing our wedding vows
and want

03:44.299 --> 03:45.933
To wear something strapless.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.235
Strapless is all the rage
in summer weddings...

03:48.236 --> 03:49.503
<i>According to vogue.</i>

03:49.504 --> 03:51.104
- Oh.
- Yeah.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.339
Last time, we couldn't afford
more than city hall, so.

03:52.340 --> 03:54.575
- It was still romantic
as heck though.

03:54.576 --> 03:55.909
- Yeah.

03:55.910 --> 03:57.211
- That was ten years a
Saturday.

03:57.212 --> 03:59.447
Hey, you guys should come
to the party.

03:59.448 --> 04:01.549
- Do we have to wear
something strapless?

04:01.550 --> 04:02.584
- No.

04:02.585 --> 04:03.885
Everyone will be there.

04:03.886 --> 04:05.319
- Oh, like who?

04:05.320 --> 04:06.620
- Everyone.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.620
I invited the whole
neighborhood.

04:07.621 --> 04:09.953
- Oh, yeah.
- Great.

04:09.954 --> 04:11.054
- Okay, we'll see you then.

04:11.055 --> 04:12.321
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

04:12.322 --> 04:15.891
- Thanks again.

04:15.892 --> 04:17.825
- Looks like Boris
won't be coming home

04:17.826 --> 04:19.226
From Cuba alone.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.394
- Marisa's coming?
Oh, my God.

04:21.396 --> 04:23.597
Can you imagine if we had two
weddings this weekend?

04:23.598 --> 04:25.198
Boris's, then Roy and Ginnie's?

04:25.199 --> 04:26.466
That would be...

04:26.467 --> 04:28.101
That would be like a
Katherine Heigl movie

04:28.102 --> 04:29.269
Come to life.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.903
- Pretty much.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.071
Eddie hasn't called yet?

04:32.072 --> 04:33.406
- No.
No.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.907
It's... he's in Washington.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.708
- Oh, right.
That place without phones.

04:36.709 --> 04:38.643
- Yeah, but if Eddie gets
government contracts,

04:38.644 --> 04:40.378
It's huge for blue sky.

04:40.379 --> 04:42.380
- Your birthday
was three days ago.

04:42.381 --> 04:43.747
Where was Eddie then?
- Come on.

04:43.748 --> 04:45.048
It was still awesome.
- It was good.

04:45.049 --> 04:46.750
But was laser tag at shadow Po

04:46.751 --> 04:49.119
As cool as laser blaze?

04:49.120 --> 04:50.653
- Schooling the kids
on capture the flag.

04:50.654 --> 04:52.154
- Yeah, I mean,
that's the tradition.

04:52.155 --> 04:53.222
- No, no.

04:53.223 --> 04:55.057
The tradition is you
and me, okay?

04:55.058 --> 04:58.096
Same as on all my birthdays
since, Le, forever.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.299
- Yeah, and Eddie nowhere
to be found.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.800
Surprise!

05:05.737 --> 05:09.137
- Whoa.

05:09.138 --> 05:10.537

Honestly, thank you so much.

05:49.493 --> 05:50.659

a good time.

05:53.159 --> 05:54.792
Happy Birthday, old man.
- Hey, killer Keller.

05:54.793 --> 05:56.761
How's the schnoz?
- I'm still breathing.

05:58.329 --> 06:00.463
- Good to see you.

06:00.464 --> 06:01.464
Miss newberg
- hey.

06:01.465 --> 06:03.098
- Hello, Hank.

06:03.099 --> 06:05.567
Happy Birthday.

06:05.568 --> 06:06.802
- Evan.

06:06.803 --> 06:08.804
- Of course I know who you are.

06:08.805 --> 06:11.706
Now's a good time to start lying
about your age.

06:11.707 --> 06:13.574
- Ah, that's good advice.
Thank you.

06:13.575 --> 06:17.744
- Good to see you.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.613
Hey.

06:19.614 --> 06:21.281
I'm glad you're here.

06:21.282 --> 06:23.382
I, um...

06:23.383 --> 06:25.751
I wanted to talk
to you about...Emily.

06:25.752 --> 06:28.320
- Do you really want
to talk about it

06:28.321 --> 06:30.521
Or do you just think that
you have to talk about it?

06:30.522 --> 06:32.522
Because you don't, Hank.

06:32.523 --> 06:34.792
Really.
We're cool.

06:34.793 --> 06:36.762
- Okay.
No.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.665
Good talk.

06:38.666 --> 06:39.766
- Okay.

06:39.767 --> 06:42.803
I'm gonna go get a beer.

06:47.442 --> 06:49.177

06:49.178 --> 06:50.545

06:52.481 --> 06:54.683
Hello.
- Hmm.

06:54.684 --> 06:55.684
- Thank you.
- Wait, wait, wait.

06:55.685 --> 06:57.051
You've got to open mine first.

06:57.052 --> 07:00.618
Sorry.
- Okay.

07:00.619 --> 07:05.219
All right.

07:05.220 --> 07:07.154
No!

07:07.155 --> 07:08.789
This the same one the CEO
of Goldman Sachs

07:08.790 --> 07:09.790
Was wearing when he testifie
before congress?

07:09.791 --> 07:11.457
- Maybe.
- Oh, my God.

07:11.458 --> 07:13.692
Paige.
Oh, my God.

07:13.693 --> 07:16.095
That's crazy!

07:16.096 --> 07:17.296
Thank you.

07:17.297 --> 07:18.531
- You want to put it on?

07:18.532 --> 07:21.733
- Yes, absolutely.

07:21.734 --> 07:23.603
I can't believe you did this.

07:23.604 --> 07:25.706
- It's pretty great, right?

07:25.707 --> 07:27.941
- Yeah.

07:31.947 --> 07:33.913
- Hey.

07:33.914 --> 07:35.045
- Oh.

07:35.046 --> 07:36.980
- How did it go with Hank?

07:36.981 --> 07:39.812
- So fun, yeah.

07:39.813 --> 07:40.846
It's a party, right?

07:40.847 --> 07:42.747
Hey, so, um,

07:42.748 --> 07:44.314
I thought raj was in Seattle.

07:44.315 --> 07:46.916
- He was, but he stopped off

07:46.917 --> 07:49.184
To see me on his way back
to London.

07:49.185 --> 07:50.919
- Mmm, sounds like things
are going well.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.156
- They are.

07:53.157 --> 07:55.861
- I have everything I want.

07:55.862 --> 07:57.462
I got a girl I like.

07:57.463 --> 07:59.631
I got a job I love.

07:59.632 --> 08:02.099
Got a watch I adore.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.600
I got a brother I kind of like.

08:03.601 --> 08:04.601
- Yeah, I kind of like you.

08:04.602 --> 08:05.936
- Kind of like him.

08:05.937 --> 08:07.504
- Little.

08:07.505 --> 08:09.672
- I have a dad again...

08:09.673 --> 08:12.574
Who finally showed up
for my birthday.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.343
Couple days late, but still.

08:15.344 --> 08:19.479
- That's great, Evan.
That's great.

08:19.480 --> 08:23.284
- I'm gonna thank him.

08:27.522 --> 08:30.257
- I don't understand.

08:30.258 --> 08:32.592
I don't need a doctor.

08:32.592 --> 08:35.761
- I was told that you
had stomach pain.

08:35.763 --> 08:38.365
- Adam called you.

08:38.366 --> 08:40.866
he's worried about nothing.

08:40.868 --> 08:43.366
It was probably something I ate.

08:43.368 --> 08:45.168
- Well, have you eaten anything
out of the ordinary?

08:45.169 --> 08:46.536
- Yes.

08:46.537 --> 08:48.037
Adam's come home from Timbuktu

08:48.038 --> 08:49.905
Or some such place
with a recipe

08:49.906 --> 08:51.673
For roasted calf's brains.

08:51.674 --> 08:53.708
- Well, maybe they weren't
roasted properly

08:53.709 --> 08:56.175
Or maybe it's just that they
were calf brains.

08:56.176 --> 08:58.109
- They're a delicacy
in the middle East.

08:58.110 --> 08:59.777
- Hi, I'm Hank.
This is Divya.

08:59.778 --> 09:02.612
- Adam.
Thank you for coming.

09:02.613 --> 09:05.113
- He was there working
on a new documentary.

09:05.114 --> 09:08.316
- About gender discrimination
in schools, not calf brains.

09:08.317 --> 09:11.588
Anyway, when I arrived here
at my parents'lace yesterday,

09:11.589 --> 09:15.223
Tali was achy and nauseous
before I made dinner.

09:15.224 --> 09:17.125
- Maybe it's nerves.

09:17.126 --> 09:19.660
Your parents, your brothers,
your whole family

09:19.661 --> 09:23.231
Are coming in and the house
is nowhere near being ready.

09:23.232 --> 09:25.566
- Stop it.
You are part of our family.

09:27.403 --> 09:31.941
- Tali had a kidney transplant
two years ago.

09:31.942 --> 09:34.511
- A transplant patient
is extremely susceptible

09:34.512 --> 09:37.480
To infection or rejection
of transplanted tissue.

09:37.481 --> 09:39.615
- And now you know
why I'm worried.

09:39.616 --> 09:41.150
- Sure.
Well, first things first.

09:41.151 --> 09:42.918
Who's her nephrologist?

09:42.919 --> 09:44.786
- Have you experienced
any weight gain

09:44.787 --> 09:46.488
Or swelling in your
lower extremities?

09:46.489 --> 09:48.825
- No.
Everything's fine.

09:48.826 --> 09:50.629
- I'll get these samples
to the lab right away.

09:50.630 --> 09:52.465
- Yeah, and make sure they put
a rush on it.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.167
- Are you taking it easy, tali?

09:54.168 --> 09:55.969
Adam mentioned
his family reunion.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.771
- Oh, he got here early
to pester me.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.640
- He's probably just checking
in on his kidney.

10:00.641 --> 10:03.175
Making sure you're
taking good care of it.

10:03.176 --> 10:05.177
- Wait.
Adam is the donor?

10:09.882 --> 10:11.916
- Okay, buddy.
Back to your room.

10:11.917 --> 10:13.184
- He has his own room?

10:13.185 --> 10:14.486
- Why not?
We got plenty of 'em.

10:14.487 --> 10:16.154
Can you get the door for me?
- Yeah.

10:16.155 --> 10:18.523
- Thank you.

10:18.524 --> 10:21.059
All right.

10:21.060 --> 10:22.327
Here we go, bud.

10:22.328 --> 10:23.594
- Yeah, that's cool.

10:23.595 --> 10:26.496
It's, like, an indoor bird
gazebo room.

10:26.497 --> 10:28.164
- So what's the plan, CFO?

10:28.165 --> 10:29.965
- Well, how aggressive
do you want to be?

10:29.966 --> 10:31.233
There are plenty of ways
to increase

10:31.234 --> 10:32.433
Your returns, my friend.

10:32.434 --> 10:34.032
- Increase?

10:34.033 --> 10:35.666
I already have more money
than I know what to do with.

10:35.667 --> 10:36.700
- Well, it's good that I'm here.

10:36.701 --> 10:38.001
I can tell you what
to do with it.

10:38.002 --> 10:39.467
- Oh, man.

10:39.468 --> 10:41.335
I'd be happy just sticking it
under a mattress,

10:41.336 --> 10:44.337
But there's probably
no mattress big enough.

10:44.338 --> 10:46.504
- So you want to sit here
in your giant mansion

10:46.505 --> 10:48.402
In the most exclusive
neighborhood in the world

10:48.403 --> 10:50.933
And you want to forget
that you won the lottery?

10:50.934 --> 10:55.499
- Have you ever heard
of the lottery curse?

10:55.500 --> 10:57.835
Terrible things happen
to lottery winners.

10:57.836 --> 10:59.337
They end up with nothing.

10:59.338 --> 11:01.908
- Okay, that's bad advice,
all right?

11:01.909 --> 11:03.243
And you have me.

11:03.244 --> 11:04.846
- And Ginnie has a rash.
- Yeah.

11:04.847 --> 11:06.847
And that's cheap jewelry.

11:07.982 --> 11:10.152
- Are you okay, man?

11:10.153 --> 11:11.653
- No, no.

11:11.654 --> 11:14.488
It's what I've been trying
to tell you.

11:27.531 --> 11:29.065
- Excuse me.

11:29.066 --> 11:31.366
I thought surprises
were my thing.

11:31.367 --> 11:32.900
- Well, surprise.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.469
- Welcome.

11:34.470 --> 11:35.871
- Thank you.

11:35.872 --> 11:37.774
This is quite a nice place
you got here.

11:37.775 --> 11:38.843
- Thank you.

11:38.844 --> 11:41.612
- Yeah.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.013
- You like scotch, right?

11:43.014 --> 11:44.715
- Yeah, I don't want a drink.

11:44.716 --> 11:46.583
Thank you.

11:46.584 --> 11:48.585
- So how happy am I, huh?

11:48.586 --> 11:50.553
My son came to visit me.

11:50.554 --> 11:52.889
- Yeah.

11:52.890 --> 11:56.692
Um, I wanted to thank you.

11:56.693 --> 11:58.894
For the party.

11:58.895 --> 12:00.695
It meant a lot to Evan.

12:00.696 --> 12:02.297
- Come on,
that's the least I could do

12:02.298 --> 12:04.532
For missing all those birthdays
before yesterday.

12:04.533 --> 12:06.667
- Uh, yeah, technically,
you actually...

12:07.936 --> 12:09.736
- Hold that thought.
- Okay.

12:09.737 --> 12:12.206
- Hello?

12:12.207 --> 12:14.074
Just give me a second.
Give me a second.

12:14.075 --> 12:16.176
I got to take this.
- Take a second.

12:16.177 --> 12:18.178
- Yeah.

13:03.049 --> 13:06.451
- I got your message, Roy.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.618
Got here as quick as I could.

13:07.619 --> 13:10.421
Let's have a look.

13:10.422 --> 13:11.789
- I've been keeping it
from Ginnie,

13:11.790 --> 13:14.724
But I'm starting to freak out.

13:14.725 --> 13:16.826
It hurts more than
I can tell you.

13:16.827 --> 13:18.627
- All right, well,
let's take a look here.

13:18.628 --> 13:22.964
Sorry, buddy.
Okay.

13:24.900 --> 13:26.934
- All right, all right.
No popping or clicking.

13:26.935 --> 13:30.302
Let's check.

13:30.303 --> 13:32.203
Okay, no ulnar deviation.

13:32.204 --> 13:33.971
Here.
Grab my fingers, tight.

13:33.972 --> 13:35.439
Okay.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.774
Hey, where'd you
get this abrasion?

13:37.775 --> 13:39.475
- Who knows?

13:39.476 --> 13:41.810
We were mobbed everywhere
we went in north Dakota.

13:41.811 --> 13:43.511
Malls, restaurants.

13:43.512 --> 13:44.645
Everyone wanted
to shake our hand

13:44.646 --> 13:45.946
Or touch us for good luck.

13:45.947 --> 13:48.214
- All that contact could have
led to an infection.

13:48.215 --> 13:51.116
I need to run a blood test.

13:51.117 --> 13:52.550
- Doc, one time
I got my thumb caught

13:52.551 --> 13:54.318
In the fifth wheel hitch
on my truck.

13:54.319 --> 13:56.387
Damn near ripped my hand off.

13:56.388 --> 13:58.088
And this hurts worse.

13:58.089 --> 13:59.589
- Well, okay.

13:59.590 --> 14:00.790
I need a ct.

14:00.791 --> 14:02.358
- Maybe I should give
the money back.

14:02.359 --> 14:03.993
- Whoa, hey,
bite your tongue, man.

14:03.994 --> 14:05.394
- Evan, come here.

14:05.395 --> 14:06.762
I need you to go
to the guest house

14:06.763 --> 14:07.963
And get the ct scanner.

14:07.964 --> 14:09.230
- Okay, why?
What's going on?

14:09.231 --> 14:10.965
- Disproportionate pain
is a symptom

14:10.966 --> 14:12.566
Of a very specific infection.

14:12.567 --> 14:13.900
- What?

14:13.901 --> 14:17.168
- I need to test him for
necrotizing fasciitis.

14:17.169 --> 14:19.737
- He might be infected
by a totalitarian state?

14:19.738 --> 14:21.605
- A flesh-eating bacteria.

14:21.606 --> 14:23.639
- Whoa.

14:23.640 --> 14:28.844
Yeah, that might qualify
as a lottery curse.

14:46.029 --> 14:48.997
- Hank, it's good to see you.

14:48.998 --> 14:50.697
- You too.
- How are you, Evan?

14:50.698 --> 14:51.765
- Good.
Thank you.

14:51.766 --> 14:52.999
- Good.
- Welcome home.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.333
- Thank you.
It's good to be here.

14:54.334 --> 14:56.300
Yeah.
I'll see you both later, huh?

14:56.301 --> 14:57.434
- Absolutely.
- Very good.

14:57.435 --> 15:00.369
- Okay.

15:00.370 --> 15:01.937
- Someone's in a good mood.

15:01.938 --> 15:03.005
- Yeah, I'll say.

15:03.006 --> 15:05.140
Did you hear
what he just called me?

15:05.141 --> 15:06.941
"Evan."
he actually said my...

15:06.942 --> 15:11.045
<i>I feel like I'm in
the twilight zone right now.</i>

15:11.046 --> 15:14.381
- Hey, um...

15:14.382 --> 15:17.283
You ever say anything
to Eddie about Boris?

15:17.284 --> 15:19.752
- Um, I might have mentioned

15:19.753 --> 15:22.121
The mysterious
Russo-Czech-talian accent

15:22.122 --> 15:23.488
Once or twice, but, no.

15:23.489 --> 15:24.856
Why?

15:24.857 --> 15:26.391
- I went to his house
the other day

15:26.392 --> 15:30.128
And I found shadow pond
letterhead.

15:30.129 --> 15:31.495
- So?

15:31.496 --> 15:33.230
- What if he threw
your birthday party

15:33.231 --> 15:35.165
To steal the letterhead?

15:35.166 --> 15:37.700
- Are you actually being
serious?

15:37.701 --> 15:39.568
So why don't you ask dad
about the letterhead?

15:39.569 --> 15:41.036
- I will.
I will.

15:41.037 --> 15:42.971
I'm just not sure if he'll give
me a straight answer.

15:45.007 --> 15:48.042
All right.

15:55.948 --> 15:57.582
- Well, good news.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.818
Your kidney function
is completely normal.

15:59.819 --> 16:01.653
- Oh, thank God.

16:01.654 --> 16:04.522
I didn't want to admit it,
but I was terrified.

16:04.523 --> 16:06.124
- Me too.

16:06.125 --> 16:07.891
I was just waiting for you
to ask for my other one.

16:07.892 --> 16:10.527
anti-nausea medication.

16:10.528 --> 16:11.862
Take one tablet and let it melt

16:11.863 --> 16:13.697
On your tongue every
six hours as needed

16:13.698 --> 16:15.598
Until you're feeling better.

16:15.599 --> 16:18.835
I think that the best
prescription for you is rest.

16:18.836 --> 16:21.671
- She's going to bed right now.

16:21.672 --> 16:22.705
Thank you.

16:22.706 --> 16:25.074
- Oh, well, it's our job.

16:25.075 --> 16:29.578
- I'll show you out.

16:33.482 --> 16:35.449
- Is that news?

16:35.450 --> 16:36.784
Just please tell me I'm not

16:36.785 --> 16:38.818
Planning Roy's financial
future in vain.

16:38.819 --> 16:42.688
- It is definitely not
necrotizing fasciitis.

16:42.689 --> 16:44.256
- Oh, good.

16:44.257 --> 16:45.524
- I still don't know what's
causing the pain.

16:45.525 --> 16:46.291
Hopefully things
will get clearer

16:46.292 --> 16:50.862
At the follow-up.

16:52.798 --> 16:54.565
- she got you.

16:54.566 --> 16:56.199
- Oh, my God.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.168
Wow.
What are you doing here?

16:58.169 --> 16:59.502
- Spa day.

16:59.503 --> 17:01.704
I got us a couples massage
for your birthday.

17:01.705 --> 17:03.205
- You already got me a watch

17:03.206 --> 17:04.673
That's giving everything
in my dresser

17:04.674 --> 17:06.741
An inferiority complex.

17:06.742 --> 17:10.577
- So call this a one-week
anniversary present.

17:10.578 --> 17:11.912
Okay, fine.

17:11.913 --> 17:13.713
I just want to hang out
with you and a masseuse.

17:13.714 --> 17:15.214
Come on.
- Wait.

17:15.214 --> 17:17.384
Hey, look.
You're killing me.

17:17.385 --> 17:19.053
I have work to do today.

17:19.054 --> 17:20.486
Like, I have to do it.

17:20.487 --> 17:22.121
Can I get, like, a rain check?

17:22.122 --> 17:23.689
- Is it the kind of work
where someone will die

17:23.690 --> 17:24.856
If you don't do it?

17:24.857 --> 17:26.258
- No, it's...
no, it's...

17:26.259 --> 17:28.626
We have a client
who won the lottery

17:28.627 --> 17:30.127
And, uh, they're
in desperate need

17:30.128 --> 17:31.796
Of a brilliant business mind.

17:31.797 --> 17:33.030
- Or yours.
- Uh...

17:33.031 --> 17:34.431
- So be brilliant tomorrow.

17:34.432 --> 17:35.899
- Well, I really want
to get the financial plan

17:35.900 --> 17:38.100
To them on Saturday as a gift
for their...

17:38.101 --> 17:39.768
It's like a vow renewal thing.

17:39.769 --> 17:41.637
- Oh, yeah, I got th invite.

17:41.638 --> 17:42.705
- Yeah, yeah.

17:42.706 --> 17:44.206
Everyone in the Hamptons
got it,

17:44.207 --> 17:46.275
'cause they invited everyone
in the Hamptons.

17:46.276 --> 17:47.676
- Oh, that's cute.

17:47.677 --> 17:49.844
Insane, but cute.

17:49.845 --> 17:50.945
- Yeah, you should come.

17:50.946 --> 17:52.246
- Yeah, we'll see.

17:52.247 --> 17:53.581
Come on, please.
Come with me.

17:53.582 --> 17:56.450
- You know, um, look, I...

17:56.451 --> 17:58.618
I want to really, really bad,

17:58.619 --> 18:00.987
But I can't.

18:00.988 --> 18:04.556
So next time,
I promise it's gonna be

18:04.557 --> 18:06.457
Even better than
it would have been.

18:06.458 --> 18:09.260
- Okay.

18:09.261 --> 18:11.261
Well, have fun.

18:11.262 --> 18:13.963
- Yeah, no...

18:13.964 --> 18:16.099
I'll text you later, okay?

18:16.100 --> 18:19.001
- All right.
Bye, Hank.

18:19.002 --> 18:22.571
- So tali and you seem
very close.

18:22.572 --> 18:24.472
I mean, not many people
would have given

18:24.473 --> 18:26.807
A kidney to an employee.

18:26.808 --> 18:29.109
- In a lot of ways,
tali's more my family

18:29.110 --> 18:30.644
Than my blood relatives.

18:30.645 --> 18:32.412
I mean, we're the only
two members

18:32.413 --> 18:34.847
Of the household
without law degrees.

18:34.848 --> 18:37.516
Plus, I was the only one
who matched.

18:37.517 --> 18:40.385
When the universe puts something
like that in front of you,

18:40.386 --> 18:44.055
It's hard to deny.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.790
- Well, it sounds like the I.V.
Antibiotics I gave you

18:45.791 --> 18:47.157
Are working.

18:47.158 --> 18:48.291
Must have been an infection

18:48.292 --> 18:49.893
And luckily not the one
that I thought.

18:49.894 --> 18:52.596
- Yeah, I feel a million
times better.

18:52.597 --> 18:55.466
I had a cough this morning,
but that's it.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.401
- Well, that cough could
be the East coast vegetation.

18:57.402 --> 18:58.702
You're still new to that.

18:58.703 --> 19:00.270
- Hey, welcome
to hay fever country, buddy.

19:00.271 --> 19:01.771
- Well, we'll keep watching
the cough,

19:01.772 --> 19:05.040
But, uh, I think you're ready
to party, my friend.

19:05.041 --> 19:06.275
Good,

19:06.276 --> 19:07.976
Since I'll probably
be the only one there.

19:07.977 --> 19:09.844
- Still no rsvps
from the neighbors?

19:09.845 --> 19:11.178
- Oh, come on.

19:11.179 --> 19:13.247
We're lottery winners
from north Dakota.

19:13.248 --> 19:15.849
What do these people care
about us renewing our vows?

19:15.850 --> 19:17.950
But... but Ginnie...

19:17.951 --> 19:20.986
Ginnie's small-town girl
through and through.

19:20.987 --> 19:22.687
It's what I love about her.

19:22.688 --> 19:25.523
She likes to see the world
as one big, happy family.

19:25.524 --> 19:28.058
- Well, we'll be there
and we'll make a lot of noise.

19:28.059 --> 19:29.826
Evan will anyway.

19:31.561 --> 19:32.561
- What's that?

19:32.562 --> 19:34.230
- Oh, that's Walter.

19:34.231 --> 19:35.264
- Who's Walter?

19:35.265 --> 19:36.632
- Walter's their parrot.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.401
He loves Foie gras
and he has his own room.

19:38.402 --> 19:40.570
It's bigger than mine.
It's like a whole room.

19:40.571 --> 19:43.907
- I may know what's
making you sick.

19:45.376 --> 19:50.113
- The pain's gotten worse since
I called you.

19:50.114 --> 19:53.749
- Tali, where does it hurt?

19:53.750 --> 19:57.750
- Where my kidney is.

20:07.396 --> 20:10.164
- Ginnie...

20:10.165 --> 20:11.599
This culture will
either confirm

20:11.600 --> 20:13.400
Or rule out whether
psittacosis...

20:13.401 --> 20:15.002
Better known as "parrot fever"...

20:15.003 --> 20:16.903
Is the source of Roy's issue.

20:16.904 --> 20:17.971
- Oh, no.
Parrot fever?

20:17.972 --> 20:18.972
That's impossible.

20:18.973 --> 20:20.306
- Walter's not a parrot.

20:20.307 --> 20:21.907
He's a...
Macaw.

20:21.908 --> 20:22.975
- Right. No, no.

20:22.976 --> 20:24.476
Psittacosis is an infection

20:24.477 --> 20:26.244
That can be spread
from non-human animals

20:26.245 --> 20:29.847
Like hens, ducks, or macaws,
to humans.

20:29.848 --> 20:32.282
The infection on your wrist
is probably from the bacteria.

20:32.283 --> 20:33.950
It could also explain
your cough.

20:33.951 --> 20:37.453
- Roy, that's great news!

20:37.454 --> 20:40.155
Wait.
Our Walter is sick?

20:40.156 --> 20:41.223
- Well, if he is,
we'll give you

20:41.224 --> 20:42.658
The name of a good vet.

20:42.659 --> 20:43.892
- Oh, no, no.
We don't want a good vet.

20:43.893 --> 20:45.126
We want the best.

20:45.127 --> 20:46.594
We want a concierge vet.

20:46.595 --> 20:48.097
- They probably have that
in the Hamptons.

20:48.098 --> 20:49.167
- How could we have not known
our little guy was sick?

20:49.168 --> 20:50.868
- I don't know.
- Hey, Roy, listen.

20:50.869 --> 20:52.536
If you hadn't
had these symptoms,

20:52.537 --> 20:53.971
Walter's illness could
have killed him.

20:53.972 --> 20:56.673
- Okay, but, doc, if I have
the, uh, "psittacoses,"

20:56.674 --> 20:58.508
Then how come my wrist
is getting better?

20:58.509 --> 21:00.009
- Just "psittacosis."

21:00.010 --> 21:02.912
And probably the meds
I prescribed masked the pain.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.180
But I'll get you tetracycline,

21:04.181 --> 21:05.914
Which will permanently knock out
the infection.

21:05.915 --> 21:07.515
- Dude, I told you it wasn't
some lotto curse

21:07.516 --> 21:08.583
Making you sick.

21:08.584 --> 21:10.718
It was your parrot.

21:10.719 --> 21:12.352
That's almost funny.

21:12.353 --> 21:13.720
- Hey, Divya.

21:13.721 --> 21:15.488
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Excuse me.

21:15.489 --> 21:18.791
- It was your parrot
the whole time.

21:18.792 --> 21:21.326
I said it was almost funny.

21:21.327 --> 21:23.595
- I consulted
with her nephrologist

21:23.596 --> 21:26.030
And tali's creatinine levels
are normal.

21:26.031 --> 21:28.665
Her pain is localized
near the kidney,

21:28.666 --> 21:30.967
But given the normal creatinine
levels,

21:30.968 --> 21:32.468
I'm more inclined to suspect

21:32.469 --> 21:35.038
The other culprit of lower-left
quadrant pain.

21:36.240 --> 21:38.241
- It's gonna be okay, tali.

21:38.242 --> 21:39.575
Gonna be okay.

21:39.576 --> 21:40.943
Which raises another problem.

21:40.944 --> 21:42.277
I want to avoid a ct.

21:42.278 --> 21:44.179
I mean, the dye has the
potential to damage her kidney.

21:44.180 --> 21:45.513
- I'll get the ultrasound.

21:45.514 --> 21:46.714
- Do it.

21:53.421 --> 21:54.554
- Yeah.

21:54.555 --> 21:56.856
Yeah, no problem
with the aorta.

21:56.857 --> 22:00.725
Kidney looks...Fine.

22:00.726 --> 22:02.393
Looks good, actually.

22:03.728 --> 22:04.728
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

22:04.729 --> 22:05.996
- Yeah.

22:05.997 --> 22:07.531
Okay, you see that pocket

22:07.532 --> 22:09.166
On the wall of the colon?

22:09.167 --> 22:11.001
It shows signs of inflammation.

22:11.002 --> 22:12.736
Here you go.
Thanks.

22:12.737 --> 22:15.705
It's called diverticulitis.

22:17.741 --> 22:20.409
Adam, we have to get her
to a hospital.

22:20.410 --> 22:22.544
She needs treatment
and she needs observation

22:22.545 --> 22:24.946
Until the inflammation recedes

22:24.947 --> 22:26.947
And that there's no danger
of a rupture.

22:26.948 --> 22:28.849
- I'll pack her stuff.
- Okay, tali.

22:28.850 --> 22:31.151
You can button up.

22:31.152 --> 22:34.887
- Thank you for protecting
my kidney.

22:34.888 --> 22:36.255
- Is she stable enough
for me to drive her?

22:36.256 --> 22:37.689
- Yeah, she is.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.258
- To be safe, I'll drive.

22:39.259 --> 22:41.593
It's on the way
and I can help you

22:41.594 --> 22:43.127
With admittance
at Hamptons heritage.

22:43.128 --> 22:44.995
- Okay.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.197
That's very helpful.

22:51.569 --> 22:54.003
Your vitals look great.

22:54.004 --> 22:55.704
- You seem surprised.

22:55.705 --> 22:57.772
- I'm pleased,
amongst other things.

22:57.773 --> 22:59.975
Must be the Cuban air.

22:59.976 --> 23:00.976
- Amongst other things.

23:00.977 --> 23:03.277
Hank, I owe you
a debt of gratitude.

23:03.278 --> 23:05.212
- Oh, why is that?

23:05.213 --> 23:07.380
- If it weren't for you,
I don't think I would have

23:07.381 --> 23:09.649
Savored my stay in Cuba
as much as I did.

23:09.650 --> 23:10.751
- You mean 'cause I left?

23:10.752 --> 23:13.219
- The time I spent with Marisa

23:13.220 --> 23:15.688
Was very meaningful.

23:15.689 --> 23:19.726
In fact, she's...Coming
to live here at shadow pond.

23:19.727 --> 23:22.661
- You convinced Marisa
to defect?

23:22.662 --> 23:23.896
- She'll be here tomorrow.

23:23.897 --> 23:26.665
- I'm happy for both of you.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.433
- Thank you.

23:36.940 --> 23:38.807
- Is this Marco?

23:38.808 --> 23:41.443
Yeah?
Why?

23:41.444 --> 23:44.078
When?

23:44.079 --> 23:45.479
Yeah, that was my
understanding.

23:45.480 --> 23:47.681
They would lift it,
the travel ban.

23:47.682 --> 23:48.749
Well, find out.

23:48.750 --> 23:50.684
That's what you're paid for.

23:50.685 --> 23:52.852
Marco, I want her on the plane.

23:52.853 --> 23:54.320
You understand?

23:58.291 --> 23:59.825
- Hey, Divya.

23:59.826 --> 24:03.162
- Hey.

24:03.163 --> 24:04.429
You're still here?

24:04.430 --> 24:05.764
- Whew.
Not for long.

24:05.765 --> 24:07.065
I have a nice bottle
of Cabernet

24:07.066 --> 24:08.165
Waiting at home for me.

24:08.166 --> 24:09.633
- Ooh.
- Hey, you care to join us?

24:09.634 --> 24:10.701
- Mmm, I'd love to,

24:10.702 --> 24:12.536
But I need to check in
on a patient.

24:12.537 --> 24:13.737
- Oh, yeah.
How's she doing?

24:13.738 --> 24:16.006
- Uh, okay.
Better now.

24:16.007 --> 24:18.475
- Oh, whoa, look.
Divya...

24:18.476 --> 24:22.144
That's the guy who donated
his kidney to his housekeeper?

24:22.145 --> 24:24.213
- Yes.
Why?

24:24.214 --> 24:25.680
- Oh, no reason.

24:25.681 --> 24:28.149
You just didn't mention
that he's kind of hot.

24:28.150 --> 24:29.417
- Is he?

24:29.418 --> 24:30.551
- Yeah.

24:30.552 --> 24:31.719
- I hadn't noticed.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.487
He makes documentaries.

24:33.488 --> 24:34.854
- Okay.

24:34.855 --> 24:36.489
- I ought to go in
and see them.

24:36.490 --> 24:38.791
have fun with your Cabernet.

24:38.792 --> 24:40.058
- I will.

24:40.059 --> 24:41.526
Have fun with your
hot documentarian.

24:53.971 --> 24:56.405
- She'll need to stay
a little while longer,

24:56.406 --> 24:59.641
But tali's gonna be fine.

24:59.642 --> 25:01.976
She and your kidney
are gonna have

25:01.977 --> 25:04.178
A long and happy life together.

25:04.179 --> 25:06.313
- Hmm, all three of us
are relieved to hear that.

25:06.314 --> 25:08.982
Thank you, divya.

25:12.585 --> 25:16.254
- Can I ask you something?

25:16.255 --> 25:18.523
What made you give tali
your kidney?

25:18.524 --> 25:21.725
- I used to call tali "mama."

25:21.726 --> 25:24.127
I thought she was my mom.

25:24.128 --> 25:25.728
- Is your mother not alive?

25:25.729 --> 25:28.797
- Oh, no, she is alive
and kicking and...

25:28.798 --> 25:30.332
judging.

25:30.333 --> 25:34.102
She doesn't approve
of my career.

25:34.103 --> 25:36.504
She's never approved
of anyone I've dated.

25:36.505 --> 25:37.772
If she hadn't
have given me my name,

25:37.773 --> 25:39.073
She'd probably hate that too.

25:40.441 --> 25:41.842
- I come from a long line
of high-priced

25:41.843 --> 25:43.776
Personal injury attorneys.

25:43.777 --> 25:46.278
Think, um, ambulance chasers,

25:46.279 --> 25:48.213
Except we don't have
to Chase the ambulances.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.715
They come to us.

25:49.716 --> 25:52.350
The line stopped with me.

25:52.351 --> 25:55.052
- I can imagine.

25:55.053 --> 25:58.289
Not doing what's expected
of you can be trying.

25:58.290 --> 26:01.024
- It was at first.

26:01.025 --> 26:06.028
It was near impossible.

26:06.029 --> 26:08.030
But tali was always
there for me.

26:08.031 --> 26:11.633
- Well, you have returned
that in kind.

26:11.634 --> 26:17.071
- It was the least I could do.

26:33.719 --> 26:35.486
- Divya.

26:35.487 --> 26:37.387
Good morning.
- Morning.

26:37.388 --> 26:41.124
- Didn't you wear that
yesterday?

26:41.125 --> 26:42.125
Did you sleep here?

26:42.126 --> 26:44.560
- divya, you...

26:44.561 --> 26:46.662
You forgot your scarf.

26:46.663 --> 26:48.730
I thought about keeping it,

26:48.731 --> 26:50.731
But summer sage
just isn't my color.

26:53.534 --> 26:56.836
- Hey.

26:59.339 --> 27:00.439
- I'm engaged.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.141
- I didn't say anything.

27:02.142 --> 27:03.776
- I crashed unintentionally.

27:03.777 --> 27:05.243
- I didn't say anything.

27:05.244 --> 27:06.945
- I was concerned for tali.

27:06.946 --> 27:09.647
So was Adam.

27:09.648 --> 27:10.814
I know.

27:10.815 --> 27:12.182
You didn't say anything.

27:12.183 --> 27:16.318
- Divya, are you all right?

27:16.319 --> 27:19.755
- I'm fine.
Fine.

27:19.756 --> 27:21.156
You know, I just need
to go home,

27:21.157 --> 27:24.325
Take a shower,
change my clothes.

27:24.326 --> 27:26.627
I will see you
at the vow renewal.

27:26.628 --> 27:30.163
- Can't wait.

27:36.937 --> 27:39.939
- It's colorful.

27:39.940 --> 27:41.473
Stop it.

27:41.474 --> 27:43.975
- What was I thinking?

27:43.976 --> 27:46.778
What if no one comes?

27:46.779 --> 27:49.046
We have all this food.

27:49.047 --> 27:53.016
Back home, people show up early
just to help you set up.

27:53.017 --> 27:55.285
- All right, well,
welcome to HST.

27:55.286 --> 27:56.986
"Hamptons Standard Time."

27:56.987 --> 27:58.154
If you're on time,

27:58.155 --> 27:59.722
You're actually inappropriately
early, so.

27:59.723 --> 28:01.857
- HST?
- Uh-huh.

28:01.858 --> 28:03.591
- Whether that's real
or you're just trying

28:03.592 --> 28:05.326
To make me feel better,
thank you.

28:05.327 --> 28:06.894
- Oh, no, no.

28:06.895 --> 28:08.195
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

28:08.196 --> 28:09.396
Yeah, no one's coming.

28:09.397 --> 28:10.931
You know of a food bank
or something

28:10.932 --> 28:12.332
They can donate
all this stuff to?

28:12.333 --> 28:13.800
- What happened to HST?

28:13.801 --> 28:16.302
- It actually stands for
"horribly sad turnout."

28:16.303 --> 28:18.136
- Okay.

28:18.137 --> 28:19.871
- God, I wish Paige were here
to see all this.

28:19.872 --> 28:21.806
- To see all this?
- Yeah.

28:21.807 --> 28:23.374
She'd get a kick out of it.

28:23.375 --> 28:24.608
- Why don't you call her?
Maybe she'll come.

28:24.609 --> 28:26.643
- I'm five texts
ahead of you, man.

28:26.644 --> 28:28.445
Nothing.
- Sorry, bro.

28:28.446 --> 28:30.313
- No, it's cool.

28:30.314 --> 28:31.314
- Guys.

28:31.315 --> 28:32.648
- Hey.

28:32.649 --> 28:34.650
- I don't think I can
go through with this.

28:34.651 --> 28:35.918
- You got cold feet?

28:35.919 --> 28:37.719
- I'd trade what I have
for cold feet any day.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.421
- Well what do you have?

28:39.422 --> 28:41.022
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:41.023 --> 28:42.490
How long has it been like this?

28:42.491 --> 28:43.724
- Since this morning.

28:43.725 --> 28:45.059
Ginnie's been looking forward
to this wedding

28:45.060 --> 28:46.393
For so long.

28:46.394 --> 28:47.594
I don't want to ruin it
for her.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.162
- Something tells me
she'd notice that.

28:49.163 --> 28:50.663
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:50.664 --> 28:51.931
This lottery curse
is unbearable.

28:51.932 --> 28:53.566
- Okay, okay.
On a scale from one to ten,

28:53.567 --> 28:55.034
How bad is it?

28:55.035 --> 28:58.970
- If I had a saw, I would have
cut off my hand by now.

29:00.708 --> 29:01.708
okay.

29:01.709 --> 29:03.142
This should decrease the pain

29:03.143 --> 29:06.978
From the pressure
of the infected sinovial fluid.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.446
There you go.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.915
I'm gonna check
the fluid from this tap.

29:10.916 --> 29:14.251
See, a high white cell count
is a symptom of psittacosis.

29:14.252 --> 29:17.721
And in the meantime, I am
going to immobilize the wrist

29:17.722 --> 29:21.557
By putting this splint
right here,

29:21.558 --> 29:23.526
Which should make you
a lot more comfortable.

29:23.527 --> 29:26.161
Now, Roy, I really need you
to take it easy.

29:26.162 --> 29:30.798
- Doc, if you're thinking
I'd sit this out, you're crazy.

29:30.799 --> 29:32.633
Give me this pain
in both wrists

29:32.634 --> 29:35.102
Before I let Ginnie miss out
on this wedding.

29:35.103 --> 29:37.137
Even if we are the only ones
here to see it.

29:37.138 --> 29:39.672
I hear you, bud.

29:39.673 --> 29:41.207
I hear you.

29:50.115 --> 29:52.350
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:52.351 --> 29:53.651
- How's tali?

29:53.652 --> 29:55.719
- Oh, better.

29:55.720 --> 29:57.454
Those flowers will help.

29:57.455 --> 29:58.822
- Well, I hope so.
They're...

29:58.823 --> 30:00.023
They're for you.

30:03.927 --> 30:05.661
"get well soon"?

30:05.662 --> 30:07.329
- It was better than
the bouquet that said,

30:07.330 --> 30:08.463
"sorry for your loss."

30:10.700 --> 30:12.701
- Why are you
giving me flowers?

30:12.702 --> 30:14.270
- I'm not.

30:14.271 --> 30:17.807
I mean, I am along with tali,
as a floral "thank you."

30:22.681 --> 30:24.348
I should go.

30:24.349 --> 30:26.716
- Right.

30:26.717 --> 30:29.785
Uh, divya?

30:29.786 --> 30:32.587
Just out of curiosity,

30:32.588 --> 30:36.257
I'm only mildly acquainted with
Indian decorative tradition,

30:36.258 --> 30:37.858
But that ring on your finger...

30:37.859 --> 30:38.959
- I'm engaged.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.627
- Congratulations.

30:40.628 --> 30:42.629
- Thank you.

30:50.168 --> 30:53.304
- If the Hamptons don't...
I mean "doesn't"

30:53.305 --> 30:58.142
Want to start with me,
then I will start without them.

30:58.143 --> 30:59.576
Ooh!
I mean "it."

30:59.577 --> 31:00.877
- Right.
- Whatever.

31:00.878 --> 31:02.512
Please find a seat.

31:02.513 --> 31:04.447
It shouldn't be difficult.

31:04.448 --> 31:07.149
- Ginnie, Ginnie,
it'll be great.

31:07.150 --> 31:09.918
The only people that truly
matter are already here.

31:09.919 --> 31:11.620
- Thank you.

31:11.621 --> 31:14.189
- Nice try.

31:14.190 --> 31:15.757
Hi.

31:15.758 --> 31:19.861
I have no idea who you are,
but I'm so happy you're here.

31:19.862 --> 31:21.263
- Well, hi.
- Hi.

31:21.264 --> 31:22.864
- My name's Jill.
Congratulations.

31:22.865 --> 31:25.033
I am a sucker for vow renewals.

31:25.034 --> 31:26.367
- Oh!
Hey.

31:26.368 --> 31:28.536
You know who you should meet?

31:28.537 --> 31:30.236
You... you have to meet Hank.

31:31.305 --> 31:33.072
- He is a great guy.

31:33.073 --> 31:34.507
- Thank... thank you.
- Well, hi.

31:34.508 --> 31:35.841
- So nice to meet you.

31:35.842 --> 31:37.008
- Honey?
- Hmm?

31:37.009 --> 31:38.310
- Come on.

31:38.311 --> 31:39.110
The officiant's charging
by the hour.

31:39.111 --> 31:40.311
- Oopsie.
Sorry.

31:40.312 --> 31:42.346
I got to go, but have fun.

31:42.347 --> 31:45.115
- We are gathered here today
to celebrate

31:45.116 --> 31:49.687
The love of Ginnie and Roy as
they renew their wedding vows.

31:49.688 --> 31:56.560
- Ginnie doll...

31:56.561 --> 31:59.430
When we had nothing.

31:59.431 --> 32:02.166
And...

32:02.167 --> 32:05.236
Now that I can give
you anything,

32:05.237 --> 32:08.808
Because we have everything...

32:08.809 --> 32:12.579
- You will want for nothing.

32:12.580 --> 32:15.449
- Roy...

32:15.450 --> 32:17.585
All the money
in the whole entire world

32:17.586 --> 32:21.389
Couldn't make me love you
any more than I already do.

32:21.390 --> 32:25.393
And I don't care if there are
300 people here

32:25.394 --> 32:27.129
J t.

32:29.166 --> 32:31.234
This is the happiest day
of my life.

32:31.235 --> 32:34.171
From the moment I first laid
eyes on you

32:34.172 --> 32:35.773
At the bowl and wash,

32:35.774 --> 32:37.976
I knew you were
the one for me, babe.

32:39.111 --> 32:41.912
Remember that?

32:41.913 --> 32:43.580
- Ahem.

32:43.581 --> 32:44.714
- I do.
- I do.

32:45.749 --> 32:48.986
- I do.

32:50.589 --> 32:51.787
- Congratulations.

32:51.788 --> 32:54.155
- Whoo!

32:54.156 --> 32:55.156
- I do.

32:55.157 --> 32:56.790
- All right.
- Woo-hoo!

32:56.791 --> 32:58.091
- I guess Paige isn't coming.

32:58.092 --> 33:00.193
- Sorry, bro.

33:00.194 --> 33:02.261
- I never thought I'd get
choked up by a parrot

33:02.262 --> 33:03.796
At a wedding.

33:03.797 --> 33:04.897
- I know.

33:04.898 --> 33:06.265
<i>It's as if wind beneath my wings</i>

33:06.266 --> 33:07.766
Was written just for him.

33:07.767 --> 33:09.167
- Hors d'oeuvre?

33:09.168 --> 33:10.235
- Thank you.

33:10.236 --> 33:13.004
That's a lot of cheese.

33:16.674 --> 33:18.342
- Roy...
- Salami. Hey, doc.

33:18.343 --> 33:19.576
- Hey.

33:19.577 --> 33:21.211
All this rich food...

33:21.212 --> 33:23.814
I mean, how often do you eat
this kind of stuff?

33:23.815 --> 33:26.483
- When in the Hamptons.

33:26.484 --> 33:27.951
And it makes Ginnie happy.

33:27.952 --> 33:29.886
Anything for Ginnie.

33:29.887 --> 33:32.087
- Okay.

33:34.190 --> 33:35.857
- Divya?
- Hmm?

33:35.858 --> 33:38.326
- We need to check Roy's fluid.
Do you have the microscope?

33:43.863 --> 33:45.796
- What do you see, doc?

33:45.797 --> 33:47.964
- Crystallized needles.

33:47.965 --> 33:49.965
- Needles?

33:49.966 --> 33:51.366
No wonder my wrist hurts.

33:51.367 --> 33:52.934
- Yeah, it's...

33:52.935 --> 33:54.302
It's not psittacosis.

33:54.303 --> 33:56.302
Though it shares some
of the same symptoms,

33:56.303 --> 33:57.669
Roy, you have gout,

33:57.670 --> 34:00.837
The king of diseases
and the disease of kings.

34:00.838 --> 34:03.371
- The gout?
I have the gout?

34:03.372 --> 34:05.306
- Uh, it's just "gout."

34:05.307 --> 34:06.507
- How'd I get it?

34:06.508 --> 34:08.476
- Well, certain foods
are rich in uric acid.

34:08.476 --> 34:11.043
Your body has problems getting
rid of the excess,

34:11.045 --> 34:12.911
Which crystallizes
in the joints.

34:12.913 --> 34:14.847
These crystals look
like sharp needles,

34:14.848 --> 34:18.081
Which caused the pain
and inflammation.

34:18.083 --> 34:21.217
- And which is why you
have the redness,

34:21.217 --> 34:23.219
The swelling, and the pain.

34:23.219 --> 34:24.920
- So how do I get rid
of the gout?

34:24.922 --> 34:26.755
- We get rid of the symptoms
of the gout...

34:26.757 --> 34:29.893
I mean "gout"...
by regulating your diet.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.194
- And I'll write you
a prescription

34:31.195 --> 34:34.029
For allopurinal,
which will help block uric acid.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.630
- So the lottery curse is real.

34:35.632 --> 34:37.532
Money did make me sick.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.534
- It's the food you ate
after you won

34:39.534 --> 34:40.868
The lottery that made you sick.

34:40.869 --> 34:42.069
- Pate?
- No, thank you, he's good.

34:42.070 --> 34:44.737
So just stick
to what you used to eat

34:44.737 --> 34:46.239
And you will be fine.

34:46.239 --> 34:47.373
- I do miss cheetos.

34:47.375 --> 34:49.007
- Except for cheetos.

34:49.009 --> 34:50.476
- I think I heard that people

34:50.476 --> 34:52.777
Are just running late
around here, so.

35:15.030 --> 35:19.132
- No way.

35:19.133 --> 35:20.166
- Sorry I'm late.

35:20.167 --> 35:21.500
- Are you late?

35:21.501 --> 35:23.935
I brought a few friends.

35:23.936 --> 35:25.236
- Yeah, I noticed that.

35:25.237 --> 35:26.738
It's like Paige plus 100.

35:26.739 --> 35:29.040
- Hey, I love a good party.

35:31.343 --> 35:32.443
- Hi.

35:32.444 --> 35:33.777
- One question.
Um...

35:33.778 --> 35:34.811
- I tweeted it.

35:34.812 --> 35:36.645
- You...
oh.

35:36.646 --> 35:37.846
That was not my question.

35:37.847 --> 35:38.880
It's good to know.

35:38.881 --> 35:40.816
Um, why did you go

35:40.817 --> 35:42.484
Through this much trouble
for a couple

35:42.485 --> 35:44.118
You didn't even know?

35:44.119 --> 35:45.486
- I didn't do it for them.

35:52.426 --> 35:57.262
- ♪ you don't know
then you don't tell ♪

35:57.263 --> 35:58.730
♪ and who will ever know ♪

35:58.731 --> 36:02.998
♪ that we've been here ♪

36:07.435 --> 36:09.902
- Hey.

36:13.072 --> 36:15.973
Marisa's not coming?

36:18.375 --> 36:22.144
I'm sorry.

36:22.145 --> 36:23.444
Is everything okay?

36:23.445 --> 36:24.712
- Marisa's been arrested.

36:24.713 --> 36:28.614
- Arrested?

36:28.615 --> 36:31.815
In Cuba?

36:31.816 --> 36:35.251
Well, are you flying down
to help?

36:36.753 --> 36:40.488
No, I'm not.

36:40.489 --> 36:43.824
Because I can't.

36:55.672 --> 36:57.506
- Surprise again.

36:57.507 --> 37:00.209
- What's this?
Twice in one week.

37:00.210 --> 37:01.710
I feel like I've
won the lottery.

37:01.711 --> 37:03.179
- Really?
- Listen.

37:03.180 --> 37:04.446
I'm just about to have dinner.
Why don't you join me?

37:04.447 --> 37:05.748
- I'm not hungry.

37:05.749 --> 37:07.249
- Of course you are.
It's in our DNA.

37:07.250 --> 37:09.117
This is meatloaf a la Lawson.

37:09.118 --> 37:11.386
- No, really.
Thank you, but no, thank you.

37:11.387 --> 37:12.387
- No, no, no.

37:12.388 --> 37:13.822
It's okay.
You know what?

37:13.823 --> 37:15.257
How about if I...

37:15.258 --> 37:17.058
I'll order Chinese.
Italian?

37:17.059 --> 37:18.325
- Dad, no.
Wow.

37:18.326 --> 37:19.493
You never listen.

37:19.494 --> 37:20.927
look.

37:20.928 --> 37:22.360
Last time I was here,

37:22.361 --> 37:25.529
I saw a blank letter
with a shadow pond letterhead

37:25.530 --> 37:27.626
And what looked like to me

37:27.627 --> 37:29.661
Some attempt
at Boris's signature.

37:29.662 --> 37:31.029
- You saw that?
- I saw that.

37:31.030 --> 37:32.798
- Wow.

37:32.799 --> 37:34.299
I can't even imagine what you
must be thinking.

37:34.300 --> 37:35.800
- Yeah, it didn't look great.

37:35.801 --> 37:37.467
- No, I've got
a great explanation.

37:37.468 --> 37:38.535
- I'm sure you do,

37:38.536 --> 37:40.838
But I don't want
an explanation.

37:40.839 --> 37:41.973
- Okay, all right.

37:41.974 --> 37:43.308
So why are you here?

37:48.248 --> 37:50.483
- You're not in Passaic anymore.

37:50.484 --> 37:53.252
- And what does that mean?

37:53.253 --> 37:57.523
- That means Boris
operates at a level...

37:57.524 --> 37:59.593
Let's just say
it's beyond your reach.

37:59.594 --> 38:02.764
Light years beyond.

38:02.765 --> 38:03.999
What are you smiling about?

38:04.000 --> 38:05.133
What's so funny?

38:05.134 --> 38:06.301
- 'cause you're
worried about me.

38:06.302 --> 38:07.869
My boy cares, huh?

38:07.870 --> 38:10.371
- Okay, don't...
don't touch.

38:10.372 --> 38:13.308
- You care.

38:13.309 --> 38:15.009
- It's not because I care.

38:15.010 --> 38:17.744
- It's because I threw that
great party for Evan, isn't it?

38:17.745 --> 38:19.646
I did good, didn't I?

38:19.647 --> 38:20.747
- You did all right.

38:20.748 --> 38:21.948
- I know.

38:21.949 --> 38:23.783
- Don't get so excited.
I said, "all right."

38:23.784 --> 38:25.151
- No, but you're finally seeing

38:25.152 --> 38:26.885
That I'm not such
a bad guy after all.

38:26.886 --> 38:28.887
- Maybe.

38:28.888 --> 38:31.656
But let's hope you're not
a day late and a dollar short

38:31.657 --> 38:35.693
Or in this case,
three days late.

38:35.694 --> 38:37.328
See you around.

38:37.329 --> 38:38.729
- I used it for
the party invitations.

38:38.730 --> 38:40.698
- What?
- The stationery.

38:40.699 --> 38:42.633
- I told you I don't
want an explanation.

38:42.634 --> 38:43.802
- Yeah.

38:43.803 --> 38:47.438
And I never listen.

38:49.680 --> 38:50.846
- Look out!
- You got her?

38:50.847 --> 38:51.680
- Wh? E he
- I have no idea.

39:18.338 --> 39:19.505
- Okay, that was...

39:19.506 --> 39:21.640
That was a wardrobe
malfunction that time.

39:21.641 --> 39:22.874
- We used to be so good.

39:22.875 --> 39:24.642
- Well, times change,
my friends.

39:24.643 --> 39:26.077
Another round.

39:26.078 --> 39:27.577
- Let's take a break, g.I. Jane.

39:27.578 --> 39:28.578
- Hi, hankmed.

39:28.579 --> 39:29.880
- Hi.

39:29.881 --> 39:30.947
- Excuse me for a minute.

39:30.948 --> 39:32.215
Evan.

39:32.216 --> 39:33.383
- Hey, dad.

39:33.384 --> 39:35.317
- I'm a nincompoop.

39:35.318 --> 39:38.220
- You're...
that's quite an icebreaker.

39:38.221 --> 39:39.221
- No, no, no.
Listen.

39:39.222 --> 39:40.288
I forgot the date.

39:40.289 --> 39:41.556
I forgot the damn date.
- No, no, no.

39:41.557 --> 39:42.723
Dad, it's cool.
- I'm so sorry.

39:42.724 --> 39:43.924
No, it is not.
- It's fine.

39:43.925 --> 39:46.360
- How could I forget
my son's birthday?

39:46.361 --> 39:49.996
It's only one of the
two greatest days of my life.

39:49.997 --> 39:52.131
- Apology accepted.

39:52.132 --> 39:53.732
Thank you.

39:53.733 --> 39:55.500
Thank you.
- Yeah.

39:55.501 --> 39:56.867
Yeah.
- Okay.

39:56.868 --> 39:58.702
Carry on!

39:58.703 --> 40:00.136
- Although... hey, dad,
while you're here,

40:00.137 --> 40:03.305
You want to play some laser tag
for old time's sake?

40:03.306 --> 40:05.007
- It's fine with me
as long as you're okay

40:05.008 --> 40:06.574
With divya destroying you.

40:06.575 --> 40:07.708
- That's the beautiful part
of it.

40:07.709 --> 40:08.975
He's horrible, right?

40:08.976 --> 40:10.610
Dad's horrible,
so we just play two and two.

40:10.611 --> 40:12.679
We give divya dad,
so she's saddled up

40:12.680 --> 40:13.747
With, like,
a massive weak spot,

40:13.748 --> 40:14.781
Then we can actually win.

40:14.782 --> 40:16.115
- You know he can hear you?

40:16.116 --> 40:17.717
- Yeah, no, no, and I'm loving
every word of it.

40:17.718 --> 40:19.918
You know, I would love
to be on your team, divya,

40:19.919 --> 40:22.253
And just take you both down,

40:22.254 --> 40:24.421
But I have someplace to go.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.989
Can I have a rain check?
- Mm-hmm.

40:25.990 --> 40:29.492
- Show them no mercy.

40:29.493 --> 40:31.761
Okay, thanks.
Bye.

40:33.631 --> 40:36.131
- I can't... it should be you
and me versus her.

40:36.132 --> 40:37.799
- Yeah.

40:37.800 --> 40:38.766
- Bring it.

40:38.767 --> 40:42.001
- All right.

40:42.002 --> 40:43.969
- All right, so, um,
I'ma take the left flank.

40:43.970 --> 40:45.136
- All right, you take the right.

40:45.137 --> 40:46.271
- So...
- I'll take...

40:46.272 --> 40:47.305
You take the left.

40:47.306 --> 40:48.473
- Well, just listen.

40:48.474 --> 40:49.974
One, two, three,
take no prisoners!

40:53.743 --> 40:55.210
- I'll take the right.

40:55.211 --> 40:57.211
- Good call.

41:11.762 --> 41:14.795
- Wow.
You must be Boris, huh?

41:14.796 --> 41:16.897
I've heard a lot about you.

41:16.898 --> 41:19.166
Eddie r. Lawson.

41:19.167 --> 41:22.801
- Yes, I know who you are,
Mr. Lawson.

41:22.802 --> 41:25.870
I know exactly who you are.

41:31.611 --> 41:34.145
- You don't know the half of it.
