[Abbie] <i>We heard that in August of 1994,</i>

00:19.686 --> 00:23.856
<i>WJZ showed a retrospective clip...</i>

00:23.941 --> 00:26.401
<i>of newsman Jerry Turner,</i>

00:27.069 --> 00:28.779
who got a phone call from a gentleman

00:28.862 --> 00:31.322
who said he had information
about Cathy's murder

00:31.406 --> 00:33.236
and he knew who had her rosary.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.294
<i>We were told that in this news clip,</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:39.830
they actually played some audio
of the phone call itself.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.751
We haven't been able to access it
anywhere else,

00:42.834 --> 00:45.464
so, we're hoping
it's on one of these tapes,

00:45.545 --> 00:49.045
but there's a good-sized box
of tapes from August.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.551
<i>So, we'll see what we can find.</i>

00:59.685 --> 01:02.225
[Margaret] <i>One day in the '90s,</i>

01:02.813 --> 01:04.572
I got a knock on the door.

01:05.649 --> 01:09.699
It was Detective Tincher
and Detective Marll.

01:10.696 --> 01:15.156
<i>They brought a tape recorder,</i>
<i>and when they pressed play on the tape,</i>

01:15.242 --> 01:19.662
it was the Jerry Turner
call-in radio show.

01:20.372 --> 01:23.212
And I'm hearing a disguised voice,

01:23.292 --> 01:25.542
and he's calling in

01:26.044 --> 01:32.094
to let Jerry Turner know that he knows
who has Sister Cesnik's rosary.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.563
What a strange flashback into the past.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.693
[man 1 on recording] <i>It was a black case,</i>

01:41.768 --> 01:43.768
<i>and it had the name Cesnik on it.</i>

01:43.854 --> 01:45.654
<i>And he said this was her rosary.</i>

01:45.731 --> 01:47.731
[man 2] <i>The rosary had Cesnik on it?</i>

01:47.816 --> 01:50.396
-[man 1] <i>The case had Cesnik on it.</i>
-[man 2] <i>Oh, the case did.</i>

01:52.446 --> 01:55.486
[Margaret] <i>And just a couple seconds</i>

01:55.574 --> 01:58.204
into disguising his voice,

01:58.493 --> 02:02.043
he let the disguise down
and he clearly spoke like himself,

02:02.122 --> 02:04.002
and I said, "My God, that's him."

02:06.251 --> 02:07.091
It was Ed.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.714
[man] Okay, Edgar?

02:46.792 --> 02:49.802
Yeah, I wanted to show you--
Do you recognize this man?

02:56.385 --> 02:57.835
Maskell.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.718
I've seen his picture.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.015
But I did not know him.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.556
[man] So, you never met him?

03:07.646 --> 03:08.516
No.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.440
[man] And then this one?

03:19.157 --> 03:20.577
That's Cathy.

04:35.734 --> 04:38.364
[man] So, you told us
that the police thought you did it.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.195
Can you talk about that?
When was that, and what did they--?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.411
What did they think?

04:44.159 --> 04:46.239
Oh, just questions.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.541
[man] Questions about what?

04:55.420 --> 04:56.380
Her.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.299
And what happened to her.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.140
I'm telling you the same thing
I told them.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.312
I don't have the slightest idea.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.477
[man]
Do you remember why they visited you?

05:14.481 --> 05:15.821
My ex-wife.

05:17.901 --> 05:21.531
[man] So, if she told...
the police at some point

05:21.613 --> 05:24.163
that you came home covered in blood
that night,

05:24.241 --> 05:25.531
is she telling the truth?

05:27.285 --> 05:28.745
I don't know.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.923
She said I did.

05:34.125 --> 05:37.085
[man]
Your first wife, is she an honest person?

05:38.588 --> 05:39.508
Oh, yeah.

05:42.634 --> 05:45.144
[man] Do you remember having blood
on your shirt that night?

05:46.429 --> 05:47.389
Mm-hm.

05:48.515 --> 05:49.465
You do?

05:50.976 --> 05:52.136
Why was that?

05:52.227 --> 05:53.847
I hit my hand.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.316
[man] You had what?

06:00.402 --> 06:02.402
I hit my hand.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.567
[man] You hit your hand?

06:04.864 --> 06:06.414
Do you remember how you did that?

06:08.285 --> 06:09.365
No.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.589
[man] I'm gonna play this news clip
for you, okay?

06:17.877 --> 06:20.257
[reporter on TV]
<i>...then on January 3rd, 1970,</i>

06:20.338 --> 06:23.758
<i>she turned up murdered</i>
<i>in a field in Lansdowne.</i>

06:24.551 --> 06:28.391
<i>Police have followed up on numerous leads,</i>
<i>but none of them panned out,</i>

06:28.471 --> 06:30.641
<i>not even the tape</i>
<i>of a still-unidentified caller</i>

06:30.724 --> 06:33.604
<i>who told anchorman Jerry Turner in 1976</i>

06:33.685 --> 06:36.805
<i>that he knew a man</i>
<i>who was carrying Sister Cesnik's rosary.</i>

06:36.896 --> 06:38.436
[man 1 on recording]
<i>It was a black case,</i>

06:38.523 --> 06:39.863
<i>and it had the name Cesnik on it.</i>

06:40.567 --> 06:42.107
<i>And he said this was her rosary.</i>

06:42.193 --> 06:44.323
[man 2 on recording]
<i>The rosary had Cesnik on it?</i>

06:44.404 --> 06:46.624
-[man 1] <i>The case had Cesnik on it.</i>
-[man 2] <i>Oh, the case did.</i>

06:46.698 --> 06:49.368
[reporter] <i>Police have followed up</i>
<i>on numerous leads, but not--</i>

06:50.160 --> 06:52.120
[man]
Was that you that called Jerry Turner?

06:52.203 --> 06:53.253
Mm-hm.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.211
-[man] That was your voice?
-Yes.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.972
[man]
Did you know a guy with her rosary case?

07:07.594 --> 07:08.604
No.

07:10.847 --> 07:11.677
No.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.061
[man] Were you making up information?

07:17.395 --> 07:18.555
Yes.

07:21.524 --> 07:25.204
[man] Can you kind of just give me
a little bit of an explanation of that

07:25.278 --> 07:26.528
so I understand it?

07:26.613 --> 07:29.373
Because it doesn't make much sense to us.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.615
Doesn't make much sense to me.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.834
[man] I'm just trying to understand, then,

07:37.916 --> 07:40.036
why you would have called
a popular radio show

07:40.126 --> 07:44.086
many years later
to give information about that...

07:44.631 --> 07:47.591
that led police and her family
to think that it might be a lead.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.934
I was dumb, stupid.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.021
[man] Did you perhaps...

07:55.183 --> 07:58.063
<i>lead your first wife to believe</i>
<i>you were involved in the murder</i>

07:58.144 --> 07:59.274
<i>even though you weren't?</i>

08:00.146 --> 08:01.516
[Edgar] <i>At first, yeah.</i>

08:02.649 --> 08:04.649
<i>I let her believe it.</i>

08:06.027 --> 08:07.737
[man] <i>That's kind of why we're here today,</i>

08:07.821 --> 08:10.571
<i>because you led her to believe it,</i>
<i>and all these clues</i>

08:10.657 --> 08:13.537
and the Jerry Turner thing
make people think you were involved.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.999
But did you--? Did you do it?
Did you kill Sister Cathy?

08:17.080 --> 08:18.160
No.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.290
[man] Do you have any information
about her murder?

08:23.378 --> 08:24.248
No.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.552
I had nothing to do with it.

08:57.829 --> 08:58.659
Hi.

09:02.584 --> 09:03.674
How are you?

09:09.591 --> 09:13.301
I have one of these minds
that never stops, you know.

09:13.386 --> 09:17.016
I mean, aren't you guys shocked
that this sort of thing can go on?

09:17.098 --> 09:20.598
And nobody's fessed--
There's people that know.

09:20.685 --> 09:24.515
-You remind me so much of her just in--
-We were so close.

09:24.606 --> 09:28.226
Well, you're exuberant, and she was.

09:29.778 --> 09:34.068
[Marilyn] This was an album that my mother
had given Cathy when she turned 18.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.912
<i>She was six and a half years older</i>
<i>than me.</i>

09:41.748 --> 09:43.628
<i>She made me feel extremely special.</i>

09:45.502 --> 09:47.752
<i>We shared a bedroom together.</i>

09:48.922 --> 09:51.672
<i>Cathy was a sleeper,</i>
<i>and I was not a sleeper.</i>

09:52.592 --> 09:54.392
<i>It took her forever one day to get up.</i>

09:57.388 --> 09:58.598
<i>So, I had gone downstairs,</i>

09:58.681 --> 10:01.351
and my mother had made
some chocolate pudding,

10:01.434 --> 10:03.234
and I painted her shoes.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.601
Because she slept so long,

10:04.687 --> 10:08.607
I had a lot of time to fill these slippers
with chocolate pudding.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.692
And then when she got up,

10:10.777 --> 10:12.607
I just sat there and watched her get up

10:12.695 --> 10:15.365
and put her feet in
the chocolate pudding slippers, you know.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.448
[laughs]

10:16.533 --> 10:17.623
"What?"

10:17.700 --> 10:20.620
If I were to play a joke on you,
it would be a one-upmanship

10:20.703 --> 10:23.673
and you would have to figure out
how you were gonna get me back.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.878
She never, ever got me back.

10:26.835 --> 10:29.795
<i>She's always told me</i>
<i>she loved me unconditionally.</i>

10:29.879 --> 10:31.629
<i>She had the ability to do that.</i>

10:31.714 --> 10:34.054
And I probably tested that,
you know, a lot,

10:34.134 --> 10:35.764
and she never, never wavered.

10:35.844 --> 10:39.064
She taught me
what unconditional love means.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.639
No matter what they do,
you're gonna love them.

10:44.102 --> 10:47.312
<i>I know it's been a long time</i>
<i>and it's hard for people to understand,</i>

10:47.397 --> 10:50.227
<i>and a lot of people feel</i>
<i>that you can't grieve a lifetime.</i>

10:50.316 --> 10:51.896
<i>You needed to have closure.</i>

10:51.985 --> 10:54.695
<i>That's not it.</i>
<i>You just miss somebody in your life.</i>

10:54.779 --> 10:57.869
<i>You miss not having that person there</i>

10:57.949 --> 11:00.239
<i>for all the important things that happen.</i>

11:01.161 --> 11:04.661
And if it's five minutes,
if it's 45 years,

11:04.747 --> 11:09.167
you still miss that person
and you can still feel that loss.

11:10.879 --> 11:13.719
<i>There is no reason for any secretiveness</i>

11:13.798 --> 11:17.298
<i>or anything kept hidden or concealed.</i>

11:18.261 --> 11:21.891
When Cathy died, I said,
"You will not die as long as I'm alive.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.063
You will not die."

11:26.686 --> 11:29.226
I'm not letting this go.
I'm not letting this go.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.942
I never came to peace. I shut up.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.362
But I never came to peace.

11:34.986 --> 11:35.816
You know?

11:35.904 --> 11:37.824
I shut up for the sake of my parents.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.276
And I always kept my mouth shut
for the sake of my mother,

11:41.367 --> 11:44.867
but all these years,
I wanted to know who killed my sister.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.383
<i>All I knew was what I knew</i>
<i>all these years,</i>

11:49.459 --> 11:52.749
that it was probably the wrong place,
the wrong time.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.970
It was a random killing,
and the police had zero evidence.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.260
They found nothing.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.756
<i>When you go down</i>
<i>these family discussions with this,</i>

12:02.847 --> 12:06.557
<i>then, you know, you start crying</i>
<i>and everybody gets really upset,</i>

12:06.643 --> 12:09.943
<i>and my dad always would stop us</i>
<i>at that point and say,</i>

12:10.021 --> 12:11.651
<i>"This doesn't bring Cathy back."</i>

12:13.942 --> 12:14.902
<i>And the line was,</i>

12:14.984 --> 12:16.904
"She would not want you to cry, Marilyn."

12:18.071 --> 12:20.281
<i>My parents were very protective of me</i>

12:20.365 --> 12:22.865
<i>because it was really,</i>
<i>really, really difficult.</i>

12:23.743 --> 12:26.913
<i>And they had two little kids,</i>
<i>you know, to raise.</i>

12:28.623 --> 12:31.793
<i>So, that's why, when my mother</i>
<i>passed away a year ago,</i>

12:31.876 --> 12:33.706
<i>Bob and I had cleaned out her apartment,</i>

12:34.295 --> 12:38.125
and I was absolutely no help because
as soon as I started cleaning it out...

12:40.009 --> 12:41.929
<i>we found all this stuff.</i>

12:42.637 --> 12:45.637
<i>I mean, there was boxes</i>
<i>all over the apartment.</i>

12:45.723 --> 12:48.313
<i>I was trying to sort through everything.</i>

12:50.103 --> 12:52.693
<i>That's when I found the articles</i>
<i>that my mother cut out.</i>

12:54.023 --> 12:55.363
<i>She saved it all,</i>

12:55.900 --> 12:57.240
<i>but she didn't tell me.</i>

12:57.694 --> 13:01.704
<i>I mean, there's articles from '69,</i>
<i>and then there's articles from the '90s</i>

13:01.781 --> 13:03.951
that my mother saved
that was in the paper.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.663
You know,
and I read that for the first time.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.669
<i>When you read this sort of thing, I mean,</i>

13:13.751 --> 13:16.751
<i>it's hard to explain to you</i>
<i>what was going on,</i>

13:16.838 --> 13:19.548
because you read this, and it's like...

13:20.466 --> 13:21.466
"What is this?"

13:22.969 --> 13:25.719
<i>It's a lot to absorb because it's so--</i>

13:26.431 --> 13:30.811
<i>It's not what I have thought happened</i>
<i>for 45 years.</i>

13:31.561 --> 13:34.651
I didn't know the name Maskell
until my mother died.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.214
I joined
the Baltimore County Police Department

13:58.296 --> 14:00.756
in July of 1997,

14:01.382 --> 14:03.552
and I went to the Homicide Unit

14:03.634 --> 14:06.974
here in Baltimore County
in February of 2000.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.675
I've been there ever since.

14:08.765 --> 14:12.265
I'm new to the case, this is
a couple weeks into this cold case,

14:12.351 --> 14:14.021
looking-- Re-looking at it.

14:14.604 --> 14:15.984
I can only tell you this:

14:16.564 --> 14:20.444
<i>If there was any evidence</i>
<i>that anybody was involved in this murder,</i>

14:20.985 --> 14:23.525
Father Maskell or anybody else,

14:24.238 --> 14:28.618
and that evidence was developed
by these investigators...

14:29.702 --> 14:31.082
there would be no cover-up.

14:32.163 --> 14:36.253
These allegations against Father Maskell
weren't brought about until the '90s.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.420
He was investigated.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.337
He was questioned.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.129
He was looked at as a suspect.

14:44.759 --> 14:47.719
As time went on,
he was looked at even harder.

14:49.847 --> 14:53.807
<i>He wouldn't talk about the allegations</i>
<i>of abuse.</i>

14:54.727 --> 14:57.897
<i>He said he had nothing to do</i>
<i>with Sister Cesnik's death.</i>

14:58.856 --> 15:02.066
<i>He denied... showing people certain things</i>

15:02.151 --> 15:03.571
<i>and being involved in that.</i>

15:03.653 --> 15:04.743
<i>Flat-out denied it.</i>

15:05.655 --> 15:07.615
But... let's be clear.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.078
Nobody has been cleared yet

15:09.158 --> 15:11.578
by us, that are now working on the case.

15:12.787 --> 15:17.537
<i>I mean, we haven't given up on anything</i>
<i>just 'cause it's 45, 47 years old.</i>

15:19.043 --> 15:20.593
We're not ruling out anybody.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.599
This was from '69 when she was missing.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.601
November 10th, 1969.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.233
And I think this one--

15:35.309 --> 15:36.849
I'm not sure where this one fits.

15:37.395 --> 15:40.475
"Case priest--"
Yeah, this is all from '94 right there.

15:41.858 --> 15:45.148
[Marilyn] <i>Gemma and Abbie</i>
<i>seem to have so much information.</i>

15:45.236 --> 15:48.106
<i>I cannot believe</i>
<i>that the police have not talked to them.</i>

15:48.656 --> 15:51.236
You know, I was trying to take this
in little pieces,

15:51.325 --> 15:54.245
'cause it's a little overwhelming,

15:54.871 --> 15:59.581
and trying to be protective of,
you know, my family, too,

15:59.667 --> 16:04.707
and try to see how far I needed to go
in this investigation.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.127
Okay, put it on.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.298
[Bob] Okay. Is everybody ready?

16:13.055 --> 16:14.805
[reporter on TV]
<i>From a church in New Jersey,</i>

16:14.891 --> 16:17.731
<i>a former priest reads the words</i>
<i>of a murdered nun.</i>

16:18.227 --> 16:21.857
[Gerry on TV] <i>It's not quite the agony</i>
<i>to talk about it now as it was then.</i>

16:21.939 --> 16:24.149
<i>But, you know, I really lost a, uh...</i>

16:24.775 --> 16:26.935
<i>a fantastic human being.</i>

16:27.028 --> 16:29.108
[reporter] <i>On November 7, 1969,</i>

16:29.197 --> 16:30.657
<i>Cathy Cesnik was abducted...</i>

16:30.740 --> 16:33.830
[Marilyn]
<i>Cathy cared deeply about a lot of people.</i>

16:33.910 --> 16:36.620
<i>I just felt it was always</i>
<i>a little different with Gerry.</i>

16:36.704 --> 16:39.374
She said, "I really feel Gerry
will always be in my life.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.417
He's someone that's very important to me."

16:42.126 --> 16:45.126
I knew she cared,
but that was all I got out of her.

16:45.213 --> 16:46.803
I got nothing else out of her.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.761
<i>After Cathy died,</i>

16:48.841 --> 16:51.391
<i>my parents didn't want me</i>
<i>to talk to Gerry.</i>

16:51.469 --> 16:54.509
<i>The way my dad told me is</i>
<i>they have to clear everybody.</i>

16:54.597 --> 16:57.807
Everybody that was involved
with Cathy has to be cleared.

16:58.392 --> 17:02.562
I think the police might have told my dad
that they suspected him.

17:14.032 --> 17:18.292
[Gerry] <i>It took me ten very painful years</i>

17:18.371 --> 17:20.211
to recover from her death.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.790
That was a long, tough journey.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.876
What I needed to do eventually
was get away from all that...

17:29.090 --> 17:30.630
<i>so I could start over.</i>

17:32.885 --> 17:36.505
<i>I went out to Minnesota</i>
<i>a celibate Jesuit priest,</i>

17:36.597 --> 17:39.557
<i>came back 12 years later</i>
<i>a Methodist pastor,</i>

17:39.642 --> 17:41.482
<i>married with two kids to Diane.</i>

17:42.562 --> 17:45.402
This-- Is this for drinking
or for putting into your cooking?

17:45.481 --> 17:46.571
[Diane] Yes, for both.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.989
[inaudible dialogue]

18:08.212 --> 18:10.302
[Tom] <i>Gemma and her crew told me</i>

18:10.381 --> 18:13.221
<i>that they went with Koob</i>
<i>to the Carriage House.</i>

18:13.301 --> 18:16.141
<i>They reviewed it all</i>
<i>and looked at where the car had been</i>

18:16.220 --> 18:17.560
<i>and talked about all of that.</i>

18:18.431 --> 18:24.271
<i>The way Gemma characterized that for me</i>
<i>was that Koob had an emotional catharsis.</i>

18:32.445 --> 18:35.865
I was a little bit distressed.
Let's leave it with that.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.119
<i>There are so many holes in his story</i>

18:39.201 --> 18:41.541
<i>of what went on</i>
<i>at the Carriage House that night...</i>

18:41.621 --> 18:43.121
<i>I'll tell you the truth,</i>

18:43.205 --> 18:46.625
<i>I would take everything he says</i>
<i>with a gigantic boulder of salt.</i>

18:47.668 --> 18:51.958
I do not believe the things
that he told me.

18:53.966 --> 18:57.386
[Gemma] <i>There are three people</i>
<i>that were present in Cathy's apartment</i>

18:57.470 --> 18:59.970
<i>all night after she disappeared.</i>

19:00.765 --> 19:04.765
<i>One of them was Gerry Koob.</i>
<i>The other one was Pete McKeon,</i>

19:04.852 --> 19:07.522
<i>who was his friend, another priest,</i>

19:07.605 --> 19:10.855
<i>who we have not been able to locate</i>
<i>or talk to.</i>

19:10.941 --> 19:15.201
<i>And the third was Cathy's roommate,</i>
<i>Russell Phillips.</i>

19:15.279 --> 19:18.369
<i>Russell, unfortunately, died of cancer...</i>

19:18.449 --> 19:22.289
<i>so, the information</i>
<i>that we have been given</i>

19:22.370 --> 19:25.580
<i>about what happened</i>
<i>the night that Cathy disappeared</i>

19:25.665 --> 19:29.915
really comes in a large part
from Gerry Koob.

19:37.051 --> 19:39.011
[Gerry] <i>Once they discovered her body,</i>

19:39.095 --> 19:40.755
<i>the police really grilled me...</i>

19:41.764 --> 19:45.144
<i>because I was a man that she knew,</i>
<i>and that was their theory,</i>

19:45.226 --> 19:48.306
was that she was killed
by somebody who knew her.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.519
[Tom] <i>Detective Harry Bannon--</i>

19:51.607 --> 19:55.817
<i>This is an exact quote 'cause it's burned</i>
<i>its way into my memory over many years.</i>

19:56.487 --> 19:59.487
<i>"Nugent, if Father Koob didn't kill her,</i>

20:00.199 --> 20:01.779
he knows who did."

20:07.540 --> 20:11.540
I was in no way involved with it,
never have been, never would have been.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.459
<i>I was trying to tell them</i>
<i>to stop investigating me</i>

20:14.547 --> 20:15.797
<i>the first time I talked to them.</i>

20:15.881 --> 20:19.261
<i>I said, "Here are the stubs</i>
<i>to the movie we were at.</i>

20:19.343 --> 20:22.853
<i>Here's the restaurant we were at.</i>
<i>Pete and I were together the whole night."</i>

20:22.930 --> 20:24.220
That's fact.

20:26.267 --> 20:30.097
<i>We went back to my office</i>
<i>in the retreat house.</i>

20:31.272 --> 20:33.272
And I remember this detail.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.027
We were drinking Tia Maria,

20:35.776 --> 20:38.146
little chocolate liqueur.

20:39.488 --> 20:42.578
And the phone rings,
and it's Russell Phillips.

20:44.869 --> 20:48.959
[Tom] <i>Koob told me that we got the call,</i>
<i>and we drove up together from Annapolis.</i>

20:50.291 --> 20:53.541
There's a chance that Koob forgot,

20:53.627 --> 20:54.877
but Koob doesn't forget.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.422
He's one smart guy.

20:57.590 --> 21:01.300
<i>For the first report in the morning </i> Sun
<i>the day after the nun vanished,</i>

21:01.385 --> 21:04.305
<i>Brother Pete McKeon</i>
<i>told the crime reporter</i>

21:04.388 --> 21:06.718
<i>that he had learned</i>
<i>the nun was in terrible trouble</i>

21:06.807 --> 21:08.517
<i>and drove there from Beltsville,</i>

21:08.601 --> 21:10.021
<i>the suburb of Baltimore</i>

21:10.102 --> 21:13.022
<i>where he lived</i>
<i>at the Christian Brothers Monastery.</i>

21:14.148 --> 21:16.608
<i>Not from Annapolis with Koob.</i>

21:19.695 --> 21:21.275
[Gerry] <i>I can remember</i>

21:21.363 --> 21:24.333
<i>two or three days</i>
<i>at the police station being grilled,</i>

21:24.408 --> 21:25.908
<i>and I remember saying to them,</i>

21:26.577 --> 21:29.207
<i>"I'm Peter's alibi. Peter's my alibi.</i>

21:29.288 --> 21:31.328
<i>If you're gonna come after me</i>
<i>for the murder,</i>

21:31.415 --> 21:33.455
<i>you have to go after Peter</i>
<i>at the same time</i>

21:33.542 --> 21:35.542
because we were together that night."

21:36.504 --> 21:39.634
[Childs] <i>Reports indicate that Koob</i>
<i>and McKeon were polygraphed</i>

21:39.715 --> 21:41.675
<i>regarding those statements</i>
<i>that they made</i>

21:41.759 --> 21:45.049
about going back to the house
and then coming to Ms. Russell's house.

21:46.931 --> 21:49.891
<i>The records only indicate</i>
<i>that they say they went to a movie</i>

21:49.975 --> 21:51.885
and that after, then they had dinner.

21:51.977 --> 21:56.727
The polygraphs didn't indicate any signs
of deception in their story.

21:57.358 --> 22:00.358
<i>But Baltimore City detectives</i>
<i>were not able to confirm</i>

22:00.444 --> 22:03.074
by any eyewitness
about the time they would've left there

22:03.155 --> 22:05.405
or the time they came back from dinner.

22:06.575 --> 22:10.405
One of the many chores that still
has to be done here, and a big one,

22:10.496 --> 22:14.536
<i>is find McKeon and see if he'll tell you</i>
<i>anything from his point of view.</i>

22:15.584 --> 22:16.844
Can I find Peter?

22:18.170 --> 22:19.960
<i>No, I haven't pursued it that much.</i>

22:21.298 --> 22:23.628
<i>I wouldn't say</i>
<i>we were the world's closest friends,</i>

22:23.717 --> 22:24.757
<i>but, you know...</i>

22:24.844 --> 22:27.054
<i>I can't tell you that he's alive still,</i>

22:27.763 --> 22:29.973
but did you go looking at all or...?

22:32.268 --> 22:33.848
[man] The night that Cathy went missing,

22:33.936 --> 22:39.146
it was Russell, Gerry,
and a third person that was there,

22:39.233 --> 22:41.823
-a guy named Pete McKeon.
-[Marilyn] Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.913
[man] I called him at some point,
and he hung up on me

22:44.989 --> 22:46.369
or the phone got disconnected.

22:46.448 --> 22:47.488
I tried him back.

22:47.575 --> 22:49.655
Yeah. I mean, maybe let me call.

22:55.124 --> 22:56.174
[Pete over phone] <i>Hello?</i>

22:56.250 --> 22:58.290
Hi, is this Pete McKeon?

22:59.920 --> 23:01.420
Is this Pete McKeon?

23:02.965 --> 23:07.465
Hi, Pete, I don't think
I've ever met you, um, and, um...

23:08.012 --> 23:11.022
If this conversation is something
you don't wanna have with me,

23:11.098 --> 23:12.268
I'm okay with it.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.559
My name's Marilyn Cesnik. Um...

23:14.643 --> 23:16.273
I'm Cathy's sister.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.942
Right, right. I'm her little sister.

23:19.023 --> 23:20.403
I'm her younger sister.

23:20.482 --> 23:25.282
I know that Russell had called you
when Cathy went missing...

23:26.155 --> 23:29.575
and that you had come there
that night with Gerry.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.082
Uh...

23:36.707 --> 23:39.537
I mean, I guess I'm just searching
for some answers, you know?

23:42.171 --> 23:43.761
Thanks, Pete. Bye-bye.

23:45.883 --> 23:48.593
He's 85.
The conversation was all over the place,

23:48.677 --> 23:50.797
except for when you mentioned
Gerry's name,

23:50.888 --> 23:53.718
he repeated the whole story again
and again.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.807
I do think he's told the story
so many times

23:55.893 --> 23:57.563
and had to tell it that that story--

23:57.645 --> 24:01.475
Once you start him on that story,
he's gonna say the whole story.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.895
We had dinner together,
we went to a movie,

24:03.984 --> 24:06.824
and then we were back
when we got the call from Russell.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.276
[Tom] <i>"'We made the decision</i>

24:10.366 --> 24:14.156
<i>that it was time</i>
<i>to put the heat on Koob,' Roemer recalls.</i>

24:14.828 --> 24:17.748
<i>Roemer asked the Jesuit priest</i>
<i>again and again,</i>

24:17.831 --> 24:22.421
<i>'What exactly was the nature</i>
<i>of your relationship with Sister Cathy?'</i>

24:24.088 --> 24:27.508
<i>Father Koob insisted that the two</i>
<i>were simply good friends</i>

24:27.591 --> 24:31.261
<i>who enjoyed a great deal of purely</i>
<i>platonic affection for each other.</i>

24:32.721 --> 24:34.971
<i>'That's fine,' he told the priest.</i>

24:35.516 --> 24:38.136
<i>'But why would Sister Russell</i>
<i>have called you</i>

24:38.227 --> 24:41.807
<i>instead of the police after Cathy</i>
<i>disappeared that night?'</i>

24:42.606 --> 24:45.476
<i>Roemer understood the reason better</i>
<i>a few days later</i>

24:45.567 --> 24:49.987
<i>after visiting Father Koob's residence</i>
<i>at the Manresa Jesuit Community.</i>

24:50.239 --> 24:53.829
<i>There, he said, he came across a letter</i>
<i>Cesnik had written to the priest</i>

24:53.909 --> 24:55.449
<i>on November 3rd,</i>

24:55.536 --> 24:58.036
<i>only a few days</i>
<i>before the nun vanished."</i>

25:09.550 --> 25:11.590
[woman as Sister Cesnik]
<i>My very dearest Gerry:</i>

25:13.095 --> 25:16.005
<i>"If Ever I Should Leave You"</i>
<i>is playing on the radio.</i>

25:17.850 --> 25:20.980
<i>My period has finally arrived</i>
<i>ten days late,</i>

25:21.061 --> 25:22.601
<i>so, you might say I'm moody.</i>

25:24.231 --> 25:26.321
<i>My heart aches so for you.</i>

25:27.234 --> 25:28.534
<i>I must wait on you,</i>

25:29.069 --> 25:33.369
<i>your time and your need,</i>
<i>because your life is so erratic.</i>

25:34.616 --> 25:38.946
<i>I think I can begin to live with that</i>
<i>more easily now than I did two months ago,</i>

25:39.538 --> 25:41.998
<i>just loving you within myself.</i>

25:49.548 --> 25:52.178
<i>I must tell you, I want you within me.</i>

25:52.676 --> 25:54.136
<i>I want to have your children.</i>

25:59.224 --> 26:00.234
<i>I love you.</i>

26:11.737 --> 26:14.617
Koob hurried to make this point
even before we started talking.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.278
"I wanna make one thing clear.

26:16.617 --> 26:19.327
I knew nothing of any abuse
at that school,

26:19.411 --> 26:22.751
and Sister Cathy never breathed a word."

26:22.831 --> 26:26.751
And I, of course, politely would say,
"She's being threatened.

26:26.835 --> 26:30.375
She's probably left Keough
and gone to Western

26:30.464 --> 26:32.844
because she's terrified
of what's going on there.

26:32.925 --> 26:36.755
You're deeply in love and may get married,
yet she can never bring herself to say,

26:36.845 --> 26:40.265
'Oh, by the way, he's raping girls
in the chaplain's office.'"

26:40.349 --> 26:43.019
If she had said something to me
about priests...

26:43.936 --> 26:47.186
sexually abusing girls at Keough,

26:47.272 --> 26:49.572
if she had said anything
like that to me...

26:50.526 --> 26:51.936
when she goes missing,

26:52.611 --> 26:56.911
I would've steered the detectives
to look in that direction.

26:59.117 --> 27:02.407
<i>Later on,</i>
<i>this one detective kept pursuing me</i>

27:02.496 --> 27:06.286
<i>and kept finding out more and more</i>
<i>about my relationship with Cathy.</i>

27:07.376 --> 27:08.956
<i>I remember finally saying to him,</i>

27:09.044 --> 27:10.804
<i>"You know, you're completely distracted.</i>

27:11.296 --> 27:13.796
I thought
you were trying to find the murderer...

27:14.716 --> 27:15.546
and you're not.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.934
You're just curious
about her relationship with me

27:18.011 --> 27:21.641
that you don't understand,
but that's got nothing to do with this.

27:22.391 --> 27:25.641
<i>So, I consider you</i>
<i>a completely distracted detective,</i>

27:25.727 --> 27:27.347
<i>and get back to doing your job."</i>

27:28.856 --> 27:32.856
And then he got up and did something
for which I will never forgive him.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.855
<i>He went back to the back room...</i>

27:38.365 --> 27:39.695
<i>and he handed me...</i>

27:42.494 --> 27:43.584
her vagina.

27:45.747 --> 27:49.247
And he said, "You need to understand,
we're going after somebody viciously."

27:51.461 --> 27:54.761
<i>And he was justifying his roughness</i>
<i>with me.</i>

27:57.134 --> 27:59.224
[man] So, it was a picture of her vagina?

27:59.303 --> 28:00.723
It was a black-- No, no.

28:03.473 --> 28:06.603
The vagina was wrapped in newspaper.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.859
So, it was--
It looked like a heart wrapped up.

28:11.815 --> 28:13.225
And he threw it on the table.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.278
I hate that guy for that.

28:22.743 --> 28:26.913
That's nothing that would be done there.
I don't know where he came up with that.

28:26.997 --> 28:29.497
That sounds like a dream or...

28:30.542 --> 28:33.802
or something that I don't understand.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.836
Not-- Not under my watch.

28:36.381 --> 28:39.841
It might've been County. I don't know.
I can't speak for them.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.099
I've never heard from investigators

28:42.179 --> 28:46.179
that Koob ever made that allegation
that he was mistreated...

28:46.266 --> 28:48.476
or threatened by something like that.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.850
I can't imagine a pr--

28:49.937 --> 28:51.977
Somebody would think
that a priest would cave

28:52.564 --> 28:55.694
by telling them something's wrapped up
in a newspaper like that.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.146
I'm not saying that "good cop, bad cop,"

28:58.237 --> 29:00.567
those kind of techniques weren't used
in the past.

29:01.198 --> 29:02.068
Um...

29:02.991 --> 29:04.581
I think that's a little out there.

29:07.996 --> 29:10.496
[Tom]
<i>Detective Bannon's last statement to me:</i>

29:11.083 --> 29:15.753
<i>"Tom, we got close to Koob</i>
<i>and we were ready to break it,</i>

29:15.837 --> 29:18.127
<i>and a church lawyer stepped in</i>

29:18.215 --> 29:21.215
<i>and chewed the police-department brass</i>
<i>out royally.</i>

29:21.760 --> 29:24.220
<i>And from the day</i>
<i>those lawyers showed up...</i>

29:24.930 --> 29:29.180
we was pulled off Koob
and you couldn't go near him anymore."

29:29.935 --> 29:33.935
I think what infuriated me
about this one particular guy

29:34.022 --> 29:35.322
<i>was he was still saying,</i>

29:35.399 --> 29:38.779
<i>"There was more to that that we didn't</i>
<i>get to, because we were blocked."</i>

29:39.403 --> 29:42.493
<i>And the idea that it had something</i>
<i>to do with me...</i>

29:43.115 --> 29:45.275
I could never make any sense
out of that story.

29:58.088 --> 30:00.758
[Bud] <i>Hey, if you've got a priest</i>
<i>and somebody's working on him</i>

30:00.841 --> 30:03.721
<i>and they're getting nowhere</i>
<i>and nothing's being done on him,</i>

30:03.802 --> 30:06.812
<i>you're making a lot of waves.</i>
<i>The archdiocese had a right to ask,</i>

30:06.888 --> 30:09.728
<i>"Look, either charge Koob</i>
<i>or get the hell off of him."</i>

30:11.601 --> 30:13.101
<i>The city had run him on the box.</i>

30:13.186 --> 30:15.516
<i>Then when we get into it,</i>
<i>we ran him on the box.</i>

30:15.605 --> 30:18.975
<i>And we couldn't come up with anything</i>
<i>that said he knew about</i>

30:19.067 --> 30:22.107
<i>or knew it was gonna happen</i>
<i>or had any part in doing it.</i>

30:22.904 --> 30:26.454
<i>We couldn't point our finger at Koob</i>
<i>and say he was the one.</i>

30:30.829 --> 30:33.079
[Marilyn] <i>When Cathy's body was found,</i>

30:33.165 --> 30:34.955
<i>we had gone to the apartment,</i>

30:35.042 --> 30:38.672
and I'll never forget,
Russell was sitting on the couch...

30:39.629 --> 30:42.839
<i>and my mother was asking her</i>
<i>for Cathy's things,</i>

30:42.924 --> 30:45.804
<i>and I remember distinctly Russell saying,</i>

30:45.886 --> 30:47.296
"I can't help you.

30:47.387 --> 30:49.507
I don't know where anything's at
right now."

30:49.598 --> 30:51.178
She was that out of it.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.354
<i>She didn't talk much to begin with.</i>

30:54.436 --> 30:56.396
<i>You know, she was quiet and reserved.</i>

30:57.856 --> 31:02.026
But at that point,
she was non-communicative.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.200
It was beyond reserve and quiet.

31:06.573 --> 31:09.163
[Cecilia]
<i>Her full name was Helen Russell Phillips.</i>

31:09.701 --> 31:11.241
<i>We all called her Russell.</i>

31:11.953 --> 31:14.793
<i>I loved her as one of my Sisters,</i>

31:14.873 --> 31:17.133
<i>but I always wondered what makes her tick.</i>

31:17.209 --> 31:19.249
[laughs]

31:19.336 --> 31:23.876
And I... I... I could not connect
with her that well.

31:25.342 --> 31:28.392
[Chris] <i>I never could really read her.</i>

31:29.054 --> 31:34.434
I think Russell knew a lot more than what
she ever expressed and told people.

31:35.143 --> 31:37.943
<i>How could she not?</i>
<i>She lived in the house with Cathy.</i>

31:38.730 --> 31:40.900
[Patricia] <i>After Cathy's death,</i>

31:40.982 --> 31:43.032
Russ and I-- We were talking one night.

31:43.110 --> 31:44.990
I guess I was just checking in on her.

31:45.070 --> 31:48.070
<i>And she said, "You know, Trish,</i>
<i>if you wanna come live with me,</i>

31:48.156 --> 31:51.076
you know, I have the room here.
You're welcome to do that."

31:51.159 --> 31:55.039
And so, I moved in, in June of 1970.

31:57.958 --> 31:58.998
<i>That first night...</i>

31:59.960 --> 32:02.840
I remember laying in the bed
that was Cathy's

32:03.588 --> 32:06.338
and just wide awake, thinking...

32:08.593 --> 32:10.143
<i>"This was Cathy's room."</i>

32:12.931 --> 32:15.181
<i>For almost a whole year,</i>

32:15.267 --> 32:20.107
<i>I would be frightened to get out of my car</i>
<i>and go into the apartment.</i>

32:21.523 --> 32:24.363
<i>I would park the car</i>
<i>and I would look at the rearview mirror,</i>

32:24.443 --> 32:27.323
<i>the two side mirrors,</i>
<i>put whatever work I was gonna take in,</i>

32:27.404 --> 32:30.034
<i>and would go charging</i>
<i>to get across the parking lot.</i>

32:31.408 --> 32:33.028
<i>I did that every single day.</i>

32:34.453 --> 32:38.463
<i>It was like, "That person</i>
<i>that did it to her is out there."</i>

32:42.961 --> 32:46.631
<i>I wanted to know what happened</i>
<i>and all that, well...</i>

32:47.215 --> 32:51.595
<i>I cannot remember a time</i>
<i>that Russell talked about Cathy.</i>

32:55.140 --> 32:58.770
<i>Cathy's birthday would come and go.</i>
<i>No mention of Cathy at all.</i>

32:59.895 --> 33:01.935
<i>I never asked questions...</i>

33:03.565 --> 33:04.815
<i>but I wondered a lot.</i>

33:07.611 --> 33:12.161
[Cecilia] <i>Did Russell know</i>
<i>what was happening to these girls?</i>

33:12.699 --> 33:14.119
Of course.

33:17.370 --> 33:20.080
<i>Mother Maurice gave them permission</i>

33:20.165 --> 33:24.625
<i>to experiment with teaching</i>
<i>in public high school</i>

33:24.711 --> 33:28.261
<i>and being nuns out in the regular world.</i>

33:29.549 --> 33:30.469
<i>And I thought:</i>

33:30.550 --> 33:34.970
"Wow, they're leaving to do something
absolutely wonderful."

33:35.555 --> 33:40.185
But then I also know
there are other questions,

33:40.268 --> 33:43.608
<i>because it wasn't long after</i>
<i>that Cathy was killed.</i>

33:46.650 --> 33:50.150
[Gemma] <i>We've talked about the young woman</i>
<i>who visited Cathy</i>

33:50.237 --> 33:54.737
<i>the night before she disappeared</i>
<i>to talk about being abused at Keough.</i>

33:55.283 --> 33:58.623
She was very specific
about what she remembered.

33:59.204 --> 34:03.754
<i>Joseph Maskell and Father Magnus</i>
<i>came into the apartment</i>

34:03.833 --> 34:06.343
as she was visiting with the two Sisters.

34:07.504 --> 34:11.764
[Gerry] <i>I find it hard to believe,</i>
<i>because Russell would've said something</i>

34:11.841 --> 34:15.261
<i>about an upsetting visit the night before</i>
<i>from Maskell.</i>

34:16.012 --> 34:19.982
And the question I raised for Gemma
when she told me about it was,

34:20.559 --> 34:21.599
"Was Russell there?"

34:23.186 --> 34:25.806
When I questioned whether or not
she was sure

34:25.897 --> 34:28.777
<i>if Sister Russell was present,</i>

34:28.858 --> 34:33.487
<i>she was a little bit impatient with me</i>
<i>and said, "I told you she was there.</i>

34:33.572 --> 34:34.862
She was there."

34:35.991 --> 34:37.371
That greatly puzzles me

34:37.449 --> 34:40.750
as to why she said nothing
to Peter and me about that...

34:42.414 --> 34:43.793
when Cathy has disappeared.

34:46.710 --> 34:50.300
That only makes me scratch my head.
Was she hiding something from us?

34:52.632 --> 34:55.012
[Cecilia]
<i>And so, could it have been something more?</i>

34:56.594 --> 35:01.635
Could they have been... leaving Keough

35:01.725 --> 35:03.435
because something wasn't right

35:03.518 --> 35:06.268
<i>and they were trying</i>
<i>to expose this priest?</i>

35:06.354 --> 35:07.444
<i>Were they threatened?</i>

35:07.856 --> 35:09.766
I don't know. I've never...

35:11.526 --> 35:14.946
actually had the answer to that
in my own mind.

35:18.575 --> 35:21.905
[Bud] <i>Sister Helen Russell Phillips</i>
<i>was with these priests.</i>

35:23.079 --> 35:25.329
<i>They were all real closely associated.</i>

35:26.583 --> 35:30.593
<i>It was all in the circle, and the killer</i>
<i>was someone in that circle.</i>

35:31.755 --> 35:35.465
<i>Sister Phillips knows a shit-lot more</i>
<i>than she's ever told the police.</i>

35:36.343 --> 35:39.723
<i>Phillips didn't say nothing to me</i>
<i>or nobody else that I know of,</i>

35:39.804 --> 35:44.104
<i>but I still say she's got the key</i>
<i>to unlock this thing.</i>

35:58.490 --> 35:59.490
[computer chimes]

36:03.828 --> 36:05.208
Okay. Here we are.

36:06.206 --> 36:11.286
<i>This is kind of hard to talk about,</i>
<i>but I did some research on maggots.</i>

36:12.170 --> 36:15.630
I know there were some disagreements

36:15.715 --> 36:21.005
between what Jean shared
about maggots being on Sister Cathy's body

36:21.096 --> 36:23.386
and the police saying that they weren't.

36:23.973 --> 36:25.563
<i>We need to see documents.</i>

36:25.642 --> 36:28.402
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>we don't know about the autopsy yet.</i>

36:30.980 --> 36:35.820
[Abbie] <i>Autopsy reports in closed cases</i>
<i>are public record,</i>

36:36.361 --> 36:38.861
<i>but the medical examiner's office said</i>

36:38.947 --> 36:41.777
<i>that they refused</i>
<i>to have any information just out there.</i>

36:41.866 --> 36:44.366
<i>They said they wouldn't release</i>
<i>the autopsy information</i>

36:44.452 --> 36:47.372
<i>because if a perp did come forward</i>
<i>and was a suspect,</i>

36:47.455 --> 36:48.915
<i>that might be valuable to them.</i>

36:48.998 --> 36:51.458
<i>So, they didn't want the information</i>
<i>just out there.</i>

36:52.585 --> 36:54.045
So, I think that's a dead end.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.094
[Spitz] Diane.

37:00.635 --> 37:01.965
Can you come here a minute?

37:02.887 --> 37:05.007
Can you find the file on this case?

37:08.727 --> 37:10.437
-Did you find it?
-[Diane] I did.

37:11.521 --> 37:13.691
Oh, my God. Look at that.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.780
Hey, Diane, while you are here...

37:18.361 --> 37:24.121
He was wondering, can you tell him
what big cases I've been involved in?

37:24.200 --> 37:25.240
[coughs]

37:26.411 --> 37:28.121
Well, it started with Kennedy.

37:29.038 --> 37:29.998
<i>John F. Kennedy.</i>

37:31.082 --> 37:33.382
<i>He was with</i>
<i>the House Assassination Committees</i>

37:33.460 --> 37:35.500
<i>with Kennedy and Martin Luther King.</i>

37:36.087 --> 37:38.417
<i>He was also hired by the family...</i>

37:38.506 --> 37:41.626
<i>of Mary Jo Kopechne with Ted Kennedy.</i>

37:42.719 --> 37:45.219
<i>O.J., civil case against him.</i>

37:46.055 --> 37:47.635
<i>JonBenet Ramsey.</i>

37:48.641 --> 37:52.061
<i>Let's see, the Night Stalker,</i>
<i>Richard Ramirez.</i>

37:52.145 --> 37:53.855
-[Spitz] <i>Spector.</i>
-[Diane] <i>Spector.</i>

37:54.397 --> 37:55.647
Oh, Casey Anthony, yes.

37:55.732 --> 37:58.822
Oh, Casey Anthony. That was a good case.

37:58.902 --> 38:01.152
-[Diane] There was the Memphis--
-[Spitz] <i>Oh, the Memphis--</i>

38:01.237 --> 38:03.777
[Diane]
<i>Memphis Three and the Norfolk Four.</i>

38:04.699 --> 38:06.789
<i>It was the appeals on those.</i>

38:06.868 --> 38:09.448
And, uh, the Stairway Killer.

38:10.955 --> 38:13.115
-[Spitz] <i> Not a--</i>
-[Diane] <i> He consulted for the defense,</i>

38:13.208 --> 38:15.958
but when he gave his opinion
to the defense attorney,

38:16.044 --> 38:19.014
he decided that was not very beneficial
for his case.

38:20.381 --> 38:22.841
-Well, okay, thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.927
[Spitz]
<i>Okay. If you are willing to look...</i>

38:28.848 --> 38:32.638
You know,
a picture tells a thousand words.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.943
That's what Confucius say-- Said.

38:39.651 --> 38:44.661
<i>This case came to my attention</i>
<i>when I was in the city of Baltimore,</i>

38:45.198 --> 38:52.078
<i>working at the medical examiner's office</i>
<i>as pathologist sometime in 1970.</i>

38:53.706 --> 38:55.326
<i>Police call up and they say,</i>

38:55.416 --> 38:59.956
<i>"You know, we would really like to have</i>
<i>Dr. Spitz come to the scene with us."</i>

39:02.924 --> 39:04.634
And what would I do when I get there?

39:06.719 --> 39:07.969
<i>I would look over the body.</i>

39:09.055 --> 39:11.555
<i>I would tell the photographer</i>
<i>of the police,</i>

39:11.641 --> 39:14.811
<i>"Why don't you take a picture</i>
<i>of the body as it is here?</i>

39:15.562 --> 39:16.602
<i>Don't move anything.</i>

39:17.105 --> 39:19.265
<i>Don't even touch the body.</i>
<i>Just take a picture."</i>

39:21.067 --> 39:22.067
And he would do that.

39:22.151 --> 39:24.491
And this is the picture
that I'm showing you here.

39:25.113 --> 39:27.413
And what was it--? What does it show?

39:29.409 --> 39:32.499
Her skirt was pulled up.

39:35.290 --> 39:38.000
<i>The chest was bare.</i>

39:38.626 --> 39:42.916
<i>The person had obviously</i>
<i>been severely assaulted.</i>

39:44.674 --> 39:47.594
<i>Closer examination revealed...</i>

39:48.136 --> 39:51.636
<i>a big defect in the side of the head.</i>

39:53.141 --> 39:54.231
Chest.

39:55.685 --> 39:56.685
Chest.

39:57.562 --> 39:58.402
Aha.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.273
This is her skull. This is the injury.

40:06.321 --> 40:08.781
I take off the skin

40:09.449 --> 40:14.579
so that I get the correct visualization
of this area.

40:15.955 --> 40:19.995
<i>This type of trauma</i>
<i>would be from an impact</i>

40:20.084 --> 40:24.514
with a dense, heavy object

40:24.589 --> 40:31.429
that was forcefully struck
against... the, uh... skull.

40:32.221 --> 40:35.271
<i>So, she was probably not even dead</i>
<i>immediately</i>

40:35.350 --> 40:37.730
when the injury was inflicted.

40:37.810 --> 40:39.520
She probably died subsequently.

40:39.604 --> 40:42.824
Who knows for how long she remained alive?

40:43.483 --> 40:44.983
And, um...

40:46.736 --> 40:50.866
made it so much more sad
than it already was.

41:02.835 --> 41:04.995
[Jean] <i>I was remembering</i>
<i>for the first time back then,</i>

41:05.088 --> 41:09.378
and I had no idea why I was remembering it
other than I thought I was crazy.

41:09.926 --> 41:12.096
And so, I didn't want anything to do
with anyone

41:12.178 --> 41:14.348
who actually was remembering, too.

41:15.765 --> 41:19.435
<i>Abbie and Gemma</i>
<i>and this grassroot movement</i>

41:19.519 --> 41:21.849
<i>has given me more confidence.</i>

41:22.772 --> 41:26.612
<i>I am more prepared now</i>
<i>to meet other people</i>

41:26.693 --> 41:28.243
<i>who have been abused.</i>

41:28.319 --> 41:29.899
And one of the things it does is,

41:29.988 --> 41:34.528
it stops the fear of meeting them
from becoming a big monster, you know.

41:34.617 --> 41:35.447
[doorbell rings]

41:37.662 --> 41:38.912
-Hi.
-Hi.

41:42.959 --> 41:44.959
-[Jean] Nice to meet you.
-[laughs]

41:45.044 --> 41:48.724
-And you're-- You're Jane Doe, I take it.
-[Jean] Yeah, yeah. [laughs]

41:48.798 --> 41:50.008
I take it you're Jane Roe?

41:50.091 --> 41:51.551
Yes. Well...

41:51.634 --> 41:52.474
[laughs]

41:52.552 --> 41:55.222
-It's hard to believe I never met you.
-I know, I know.

41:56.389 --> 41:57.349
Well...

41:58.850 --> 42:00.390
-And you're Donna.
-Hi, I'm Donna.

42:00.476 --> 42:02.146
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

42:02.603 --> 42:04.483
Nice to meet you. I'm Jean.

42:05.064 --> 42:06.194
Come in. Come in.

42:06.274 --> 42:08.114
-I didn't even know what you looked like.
-Oh!

42:09.235 --> 42:12.315
Back in '94 when I got the notice,
you know,

42:12.405 --> 42:16.155
asking if I knew anything
about sexual abuse at Keough,

42:16.242 --> 42:17.742
it was like, "Oh, my God, they know."

42:17.827 --> 42:19.327
-[Jean] Yeah. [laughs]
-"Oh, they know.

42:19.412 --> 42:22.042
Somebody had the nerve
to come forward."

42:22.123 --> 42:25.173
You did a lot for my recovery, you know.

42:25.251 --> 42:27.751
I know we lost
and they swept it under the carpet,

42:27.837 --> 42:29.587
but it made me feel better.

42:29.672 --> 42:30.882
[Donna] Yeah. I can't even be--

42:31.466 --> 42:35.636
Like, now that I'm an adult,
I can't even be mad at him.

42:35.720 --> 42:39.770
I'm mad at people that hid him
and let him, you know... Ugh.

42:40.266 --> 42:41.426
It's just unbelievable.

42:42.310 --> 42:44.560
Were either of you called
to the nurse's office?

42:44.645 --> 42:46.975
'Cause I got called
to the nurse's office a lot,

42:47.065 --> 42:50.485
and the nurse would say,
"Father Maskell wants to see you."

42:51.069 --> 42:55.739
They both knew that I was walking
down that hallway to hell, and--

42:55.823 --> 42:57.913
But then I think of Sister Cathy,
and I think,

42:57.992 --> 43:01.952
"Well, maybe they were scared to death
that he was gonna kill them," you know?

43:02.789 --> 43:04.869
My husband had a plan to kill him.

43:05.833 --> 43:09.213
And I would go to therapy,
and I would come back and I would say,

43:09.796 --> 43:13.296
"Nancy said don't do that, you know,
because, you know...

43:13.382 --> 43:14.342
[all laugh]

43:14.425 --> 43:16.885
You know, it will be us
who end up being hurt by it

43:16.969 --> 43:19.139
because me and the kids
won't have you around."

43:19.222 --> 43:21.102
-Right.
-But he had it planned out.

43:21.182 --> 43:22.522
He knew what he was gonna do,

43:22.600 --> 43:25.230
and he only didn't do it
because I had asked him not to.

43:25.311 --> 43:26.561
I called him in '80...

43:27.271 --> 43:32.111
and told him, "If I ever see you around me
or one of my kids, I will kill you."

43:32.193 --> 43:33.033
[Jean] Wow. Wow.

43:33.111 --> 43:36.861
And then another time later,
I heard he was in this church service,

43:37.406 --> 43:39.906
and I walked into the confessional.

43:40.493 --> 43:43.583
I was just gonna start yelling
and screaming at him, and I thought,

43:43.663 --> 43:46.173
"Everybody will be back here
defending him."

43:46.249 --> 43:47.879
-[Jean] Right.
-I know they'll defend him.

43:47.959 --> 43:53.009
And so, I, you know, told him,
"Stay away from me or I'll kill you."

43:53.256 --> 43:55.626
And I am so glad he's dead, because...

43:55.716 --> 43:56.796
[laughs]

43:56.884 --> 44:00.434
I don't know that I would be able
to control myself now.

44:00.513 --> 44:04.393
Now that we're all together, you know,
we might have to carry out that...

44:04.475 --> 44:05.555
[all laughing]

44:05.643 --> 44:09.443
Thank you. This is really special.

44:14.026 --> 44:16.026
[Brian] This one nightstick--

44:16.112 --> 44:19.162
This is the one I carried all these years.

44:19.782 --> 44:22.202
There was a lot
of different uses for these.

44:22.451 --> 44:24.251
You could walk people with them.

44:24.328 --> 44:28.918
If they were handcuffed, under their arm,
you could walk them.

44:29.834 --> 44:31.544
<i>When I was a detective</i>

44:31.627 --> 44:34.547
<i>with the Baltimore Police Department</i>
<i>in the '90s,</i>

44:34.630 --> 44:37.260
I was studying to be a funeral director.

44:37.800 --> 44:40.930
Well, I was working for some
of the local funeral homes at the time.

44:42.054 --> 44:48.194
And we were doing a funeral
at Holy Cross Church.

44:49.270 --> 44:53.940
<i>And me and the funeral director</i>
<i>were standing outside.</i>

44:55.651 --> 45:00.241
Well, I saw them bring Maskell out
behind the church.

45:01.532 --> 45:04.582
<i>He was walking in the center</i>
<i>of a small squad of people,</i>

45:04.660 --> 45:06.450
<i>maybe three or four.</i>

45:07.330 --> 45:10.290
And they put him in handcuffs
and drove him away in unmarked cars.

45:12.960 --> 45:18.050
<i>In the city, we were not allowed</i>
<i>just to put handcuffs on people.</i>

45:18.132 --> 45:21.642
<i>You put the handcuffs on somebody,</i>
<i>they were under arrest.</i>

45:22.470 --> 45:25.680
<i>So, to see him come out of that church</i>
<i>that day with handcuffs on...</i>

45:26.182 --> 45:28.732
<i>there were charges to be filed,</i>

45:28.809 --> 45:31.849
<i>or it was a pretty intense investigation</i>
<i>going on.</i>

45:33.189 --> 45:35.439
There would have to be some kind
of paper trail.

45:36.692 --> 45:39.572
You just don't take somebody
out of a building,

45:39.654 --> 45:42.824
put him in a car, take him somewhere,
and there's no paper trail.

45:42.907 --> 45:44.157
It don't work that way.

45:47.286 --> 45:48.786
[Abbie] <i>There have always been stories</i>

45:48.871 --> 45:53.291
<i>that there were police/government</i>
<i>cover-ups of Maskell's crime...</i>

45:53.918 --> 45:57.588
Hi. I was looking for information
on old criminal records.

45:57.672 --> 46:01.842
They said if I came, I could look up names
in a log and find the case numbers?

46:01.926 --> 46:03.886
<i>...that he was never criminally charged</i>

46:03.970 --> 46:06.930
even though he had multiple accusations
of abuse

46:07.014 --> 46:09.524
and that he was protected
by the church and the state.

46:12.436 --> 46:15.106
<i>I'm pretty conservative,</i>
<i>or I'm the doubting Thomas.</i>

46:15.189 --> 46:17.149
<i>Give me documentation. Give me proof.</i>

46:19.026 --> 46:22.526
<i>But it's been two years now, and...</i>

46:23.531 --> 46:27.951
we're being told that documentation
we have every reason to know existed

46:28.035 --> 46:29.245
does not exist.

46:30.579 --> 46:33.829
<i>I've written letters</i>
<i>to the City of Baltimore Police,</i>

46:33.916 --> 46:38.416
<i>to the CIA, the FBI,</i>
<i>Freedom of Information Act request.</i>

46:39.171 --> 46:40.921
<i>"Dear Baltimore City Police Department:</i>

46:41.007 --> 46:43.547
<i>This is a request</i>
<i>under the Maryland Public Information Act.</i>

46:43.634 --> 46:48.434
<i>I am requesting copies of all complaints</i>
<i>made to the Baltimore City Sex Crimes Unit</i>

46:48.514 --> 46:50.644
<i>that named Father A. Joseph Maskell."</i>

46:51.726 --> 46:55.016
<i>We know that between 30 and 100</i>
<i>Keough women</i>

46:55.104 --> 46:59.534
<i>went to the Baltimore City Police</i>
<i>Sex Crimes Division in 1994.</i>

47:02.903 --> 47:07.453
[Beverly] <i>The police came to our office</i>
<i>and met with and spoke to our victims.</i>

47:08.826 --> 47:10.906
All of my notes...

47:10.995 --> 47:15.615
from my interviews with the victims,
including their contact information,

47:15.708 --> 47:19.208
and my notes of what they described
happening to them, I turned over.

47:19.295 --> 47:22.335
Once I turned things over... I don't know.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.800
"Dear Mrs. Schaub:
After your first letter,

47:24.884 --> 47:26.264
I conducted a database search.

47:27.094 --> 47:31.144
<i>The Sex Offense Unit had advised me they</i>
<i>did not have files for Joseph Maskell.</i>

47:31.807 --> 47:33.347
<i>The Homicide Section also advised</i>

47:33.434 --> 47:36.484
<i>that they do not have any files</i>
<i>concerning Joseph Maskell.</i>

47:36.562 --> 47:39.772
<i>There is no other place to search</i>
<i>for the records you were asking for.</i>

47:40.566 --> 47:42.186
Sorry I could not be of more help."

47:44.570 --> 47:46.950
<i>Why are these documents not available?</i>

47:47.031 --> 47:48.531
Why are they not found?

47:50.451 --> 47:53.951
Yeah, I don't understand
how that would be, you know,

47:54.038 --> 47:57.828
unless the reports were just made
to disappear.

47:58.751 --> 48:01.801
If there were detectives in Baltimore
working this case,

48:01.879 --> 48:03.589
there would be a case folder there...

48:04.757 --> 48:07.587
and the state's attorney's office
would have a case folder...

48:08.177 --> 48:10.217
because they would get copies
of everything.

48:13.099 --> 48:15.059
[man] Where would those statements be?

48:15.142 --> 48:19.112
Would they be destroyed for some reason,
do you know, or...?

48:20.147 --> 48:25.487
Well, keep in mind
that, um, this was the mid-'90s,

48:25.569 --> 48:29.449
so, things were not kept in a computer.

48:30.074 --> 48:34.834
They would have just been pieces of paper
in a folder.

48:36.455 --> 48:41.245
[Abbie] <i>So, there's a Jane Roe</i>
<i>and a Jane Doe v. Maskell and all.</i>

48:42.670 --> 48:46.380
<i>Somewhere in these records,</i>
<i>it says that documents from the dig...</i>

48:47.341 --> 48:50.141
<i>were shown to the judge privately</i>
<i>in chambers.</i>

48:52.513 --> 48:56.933
The cover here says
"With one box of exhibits."

48:57.393 --> 48:59.603
Now, we would've loved
to see the exhibits,

49:00.187 --> 49:02.397
but they say it's just gone.
It's not there.

49:03.482 --> 49:09.162
We've now heard that
the cemetery-dig documents were stored

49:09.238 --> 49:13.118
in a basement evidence room
that was flooded during a storm

49:13.200 --> 49:15.450
and were just destroyed and disposed of.

49:16.370 --> 49:19.960
<i>It seems like all the hard documents</i>

49:20.040 --> 49:22.250
<i>that we've tried to get from the city...</i>

49:23.627 --> 49:26.007
<i>have just disappeared.</i>
<i>They're just not there.</i>

49:26.797 --> 49:29.337
<i>And I am very uncomfortable</i>

49:29.884 --> 49:32.514
<i>that the Baltimore City</i>
<i>State's Attorney's Office</i>

49:32.595 --> 49:35.845
<i>opted not to bring any criminal charges</i>
<i>against Father Maskell.</i>

49:37.850 --> 49:40.940
<i>I went down to the Baltimore City</i>
<i>Courthouse several times.</i>

49:41.020 --> 49:42.650
<i>I went to the archives.</i>

49:44.023 --> 49:45.113
-Are you in line?
-Yeah.

49:45.191 --> 49:46.111
Okay.

49:47.359 --> 49:49.649
[Abbie] <i>We found not only Maskell,</i>

49:49.737 --> 49:52.067
<i>but there was virtually no priests</i>
<i>in Baltimore</i>

49:52.156 --> 49:55.986
<i>that had been found guilty</i>
<i>of sex-abuse crimes,</i>

49:56.076 --> 50:00.746
<i>despite the archdiocese list of '02</i>
<i>that had maybe 50 names on it.</i>

50:01.332 --> 50:03.042
<i>And when I go through the civil cases</i>

50:03.125 --> 50:05.955
<i>that were filed against the priests</i>
<i>and the archdiocese,</i>

50:06.629 --> 50:11.219
<i>every one I can find was either dismissed</i>
<i>on the statute of limitations</i>

50:11.300 --> 50:15.050
or it was settled by the church
with a cash settlement.

50:16.138 --> 50:17.718
So, there were no findings.

50:17.806 --> 50:21.266
No Catholic priest was ever found guilty
of abuse there either.

50:21.852 --> 50:23.442
[man] I don't know if you remember this,

50:23.520 --> 50:27.400
but in 2002 the archdiocese
published a list of abusive priests,

50:27.483 --> 50:31.653
<i>and it had over 50 names,</i>
<i>and as far as we can find,</i>

50:31.737 --> 50:36.527
there's only one case in Baltimore City
where a guilty verdict happened.

50:37.284 --> 50:40.164
And in that case,
the priest pleaded guilty.

50:40.246 --> 50:41.286
Why is that?

50:41.372 --> 50:44.882
Well, once again,
you've gotta have the evidence, okay?

50:44.959 --> 50:46.709
If the evidence isn't there

50:46.794 --> 50:50.094
to meet the standard of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt,

50:50.172 --> 50:51.382
you can't go forward.

50:54.718 --> 50:57.298
[Abbie] <i>My mood changes.</i>
<i>Some weeks I'm angry and burned out</i>

50:57.388 --> 50:59.388
<i>and just wanna say</i>
<i>we've done what we can.</i>

50:59.473 --> 51:03.353
<i>You're not sure if it's just</i>
<i>a complete waste of your time and energy,</i>

51:03.435 --> 51:07.145
<i>or whether</i>
<i>there's some strategic advantage</i>

51:07.231 --> 51:10.281
to just politely nibbling away, saying,

51:10.359 --> 51:12.899
"Hey, we're paying attention.
We're still here."

51:13.612 --> 51:19.032
You would think that this was
a significant enough high-profile case

51:19.118 --> 51:22.328
that there would be records saved
about the investigation,

51:22.413 --> 51:23.713
about the complaints.

51:23.789 --> 51:26.039
It's hard to believe
that there's nothing there.

51:38.304 --> 51:41.064
[Gerry] Ocean Heights Presbyterian Church.

51:55.279 --> 51:57.489
<i>I think whoever did it is guilty...</i>

51:58.782 --> 52:03.162
<i>and has had to live with something</i>
<i>for a long time, hiding...</i>

52:04.204 --> 52:05.754
concealing, avoiding.

52:05.831 --> 52:08.331
You know, has lived a miserable life
wrapped around it.

52:09.335 --> 52:10.955
I'd be the first person to tell you

52:11.045 --> 52:13.505
that the first person
to forgive him would be Cathy.

52:15.924 --> 52:17.844
That's the kind of person she was.

52:19.511 --> 52:20.551
And she would inspire--

52:20.638 --> 52:23.308
Has inspired forgiveness in me,
whoever he is.

52:23.682 --> 52:26.062
I can't walk around
with that anger inside me.

52:27.186 --> 52:30.606
I want to locate the discussion tonight

52:30.689 --> 52:36.069
about the real meaning of Yom Kippur,
seeking perfection...

52:36.653 --> 52:39.573
and then acknowledging failures
and then seeking it again.

52:40.324 --> 52:42.034
I can't help but think,

52:42.576 --> 52:46.536
for those of us who were raised
in the Catholic community, this is what?

52:46.997 --> 52:50.747
Going to confession on Saturday,
going to Communion on a Sunday,

52:50.834 --> 52:55.174
and then coming back the next Saturday
and needing to go to confession again.

52:55.255 --> 52:56.755
It had nothing to do...

52:58.258 --> 53:02.638
with being rescued
from a fall called original sin.

53:05.265 --> 53:06.675
[Diane] <i>Well, Gerry and I met...</i>

53:06.767 --> 53:11.897
um, when I was in my last year seminary

53:11.980 --> 53:14.480
<i>at the United Theological Seminary</i>
<i>of the Twin Cities.</i>

53:15.567 --> 53:17.737
<i>We didn't hit it off very well at first.</i>

53:19.363 --> 53:26.163
I was in a fairly newfound feminist phase.

53:27.788 --> 53:31.128
<i>And I had a lot</i>
<i>of anti-Catholic sentiment.</i>

53:32.251 --> 53:37.301
I thought a lot of the stuff
that had been important to him in his life

53:37.923 --> 53:39.343
was pretty much nonsense.

53:39.425 --> 53:40.465
[laughs]

53:40.551 --> 53:41.511
You know?

53:41.593 --> 53:43.973
Just calling people "Father" and,
you know...

53:44.888 --> 53:49.348
<i>But somehow we started talking,</i>
<i>and he talked about Cathy,</i>

53:49.435 --> 53:54.265
this very dear friend, this person
he loved who was killed, and I--

53:54.356 --> 53:56.816
<i>Then I said, "Well, I had someone,</i>

53:56.900 --> 54:00.150
<i>actually my first love,</i>
<i>who was killed in Vietnam."</i>

54:00.737 --> 54:02.357
<i>And that opened the door.</i>

54:03.031 --> 54:06.991
The rest, as they say, is history.
But that that drew us together.

54:09.246 --> 54:12.786
<i>Our values, our commitment to ministry,</i>

54:12.875 --> 54:15.915
<i>to trying to work for love and justice</i>
<i>and peace in the world,</i>

54:16.003 --> 54:17.843
<i>all of those things drew us together.</i>

54:20.257 --> 54:22.627
<i>There is a passage in Scripture</i>

54:22.718 --> 54:25.798
about everything that is in darkness
being brought to light.

54:30.017 --> 54:33.767
<i>If there were ever any remote possibility</i>

54:34.396 --> 54:36.726
<i>that he had been involved</i>
<i>in something criminal...</i>

54:37.900 --> 54:39.530
<i>I would want that brought to light.</i>

54:42.946 --> 54:49.906
The truth is more important than some...
story that we tell ourselves

54:49.995 --> 54:55.075
to keep our lives...
untroubled on the surface.

54:58.879 --> 55:01.169
-Hey, how was the class?
-Hello.

55:01.256 --> 55:03.796
[Diane]
<i>I'm confident that he was not involved.</i>

55:05.969 --> 55:10.429
I believe he was not in any way involved
in anything

55:10.516 --> 55:15.146
that would ever have harmed or hurt her
or anyone else.

55:15.979 --> 55:20.109
And I've lived with him for 34 years,
so, I think I have a good read on that.

55:31.745 --> 55:34.115
[Marilyn] <i>After Cathy disappeared,</i>

55:34.206 --> 55:38.456
I went back to school,
and I was at my dorm.

55:39.336 --> 55:40.956
I hadn't been back long,

55:41.046 --> 55:43.626
so, I'm thinking it had to be
about a week afterwards.

55:44.883 --> 55:47.763
<i>And I went in the evening,</i>
<i>got my mail from my mailbox,</i>

55:48.345 --> 55:51.465
<i>and that's when the letter was there</i>
<i>from Cathy.</i>

55:52.641 --> 55:55.641
<i>Her handwriting was very distinctive.</i>
<i>It was Cathy's handwriting.</i>

55:56.937 --> 55:59.397
<i>I called my father,</i>
<i>who'd worked for the post office.</i>

55:59.481 --> 56:02.991
<i>He said, "Tell me everything</i>
<i>that the postmark says."</i>

56:07.030 --> 56:09.660
<i>He said, "Marilyn,</i>
<i>it was sent after Cathy went missing.</i>

56:09.741 --> 56:11.081
<i>It was not sent before.</i>

56:11.618 --> 56:15.078
Stay there and don't move
and don't open it,

56:15.163 --> 56:18.423
because it could be evidence.
So, please, don't open it, Marilyn."

56:18.500 --> 56:21.960
You know? You can imagine how much
I really wanted to open that letter.

56:23.547 --> 56:27.127
<i>I remember expecting a policeman to come,</i>
<i>but it was somebody--</i>

56:27.217 --> 56:30.677
It must've been a plainclothes policeman.
He didn't have a uniform on.

56:30.762 --> 56:32.142
<i>I called my father and I said</i>

56:32.723 --> 56:35.853
<i>whoever came to get that letter</i>
<i>was not dressed as a policeman.</i>

56:36.810 --> 56:39.650
He said, "It was probably a detective.
Don't worry about that.

56:39.730 --> 56:42.110
You did the right thing
by giving it to them."

56:43.025 --> 56:46.855
<i>For all these years, the fact</i>
<i>that I was told that it was evidence</i>

56:46.945 --> 56:50.565
<i>and that's why they couldn't release it</i>
<i>made me think that--</i>

56:50.657 --> 56:52.327
<i>What is in that card?</i>

56:54.036 --> 56:56.196
<i>What did it say? What did it say?</i>

56:58.040 --> 57:01.500
<i>The detectives that I met with</i>
<i>when I went to Baltimore in March--</i>

57:01.585 --> 57:04.585
<i>I was there</i>
<i>to give them my contact information</i>

57:04.671 --> 57:06.051
since my parents were dead.

57:07.090 --> 57:09.800
Is there anything new? Anything going on?

57:09.885 --> 57:11.255
Do you know who did it?

57:11.345 --> 57:14.215
But also to tell you
I would really like my letter,

57:14.306 --> 57:16.306
and I understand that's evidence,

57:16.391 --> 57:19.521
<i>and if I'm not even allowed to touch it,</i>
<i>could we--?</i>

57:19.603 --> 57:21.523
<i>Could I just look at it?</i>

57:21.605 --> 57:22.475
<i>Could I read it?</i>

57:24.024 --> 57:26.444
They said they can't find it.
It must have been lost.

57:27.444 --> 57:30.204
<i>It existed. There's no doubt it existed.</i>

57:30.280 --> 57:32.530
<i>There's no doubt</i>
<i>it was given to the police.</i>

57:32.616 --> 57:35.366
There's no doubt the police had it.
Where is it?

57:39.790 --> 57:41.880
[man]
Marilyn Cesnik, who's Cathy's sister,

57:41.959 --> 57:45.049
said that she received a letter
after Cathy went missing.

57:45.128 --> 57:45.958
Yes.

57:46.046 --> 57:49.586
[man] Could it have had a clue about what
engagement present she had bought her?

57:49.675 --> 57:52.675
'Cause Marilyn was the one
who had just gotten engaged.

57:52.761 --> 57:57.891
My understanding from her is that
the letter is lost or has disappeared?

58:00.769 --> 58:02.729
Yeah, well, I know about the letter.

58:03.271 --> 58:04.941
I have information about the letter,

58:05.023 --> 58:07.823
that there was a letter received
by her sister afterwards.

58:07.901 --> 58:11.321
[man] But as far as I know, the letter
isn't a part of the evidence anymore.

58:12.531 --> 58:15.661
[Robin] The city would have had possession
of that,

58:15.742 --> 58:17.122
and we've never seen it.

58:19.705 --> 58:24.125
[man] So, what you're saying, I think,
Robin, is that you know that it wasn't--

58:24.209 --> 58:28.129
At least right now, you know it wasn't
part of the evidence handed to County?

58:28.213 --> 58:29.593
It's not in our evidence room.

58:29.673 --> 58:31.553
-Do we got a copy of the beast?
-[Robin] Yes.

58:32.300 --> 58:34.260
So, we don't have anything from the city.

58:34.344 --> 58:35.684
[Robin] Correct.

58:56.742 --> 58:58.082
[Childs] Can you give me one sec?

59:03.665 --> 59:06.835
I gotta call the city and see
if they still got evidence down there.

59:14.760 --> 59:17.100
I made a bunch of calls,
talked to some people.

59:17.179 --> 59:18.849
Haven't been able to verify

59:18.930 --> 59:22.520
that the letter was ever turned over to us
from the city.

59:23.602 --> 59:27.692
Uh... It was something
that was heard about but never--

59:27.773 --> 59:31.363
We-- From what I just got
from the phone calls I made,

59:31.443 --> 59:34.153
we never received any physical evidence
from the city.

59:34.738 --> 59:36.488
So, I can't tell you.

59:37.032 --> 59:39.202
I would have thought any documentation,

59:39.701 --> 59:44.211
any physical evidence that would
have been recovered by the city

59:44.289 --> 59:47.329
during the missing-person investigation,

59:47.417 --> 59:49.997
would have been turned over
to Baltimore County.

59:50.587 --> 59:52.917
[man] Marilyn says it was
either postmarked on the Monday

59:53.006 --> 59:54.256
or Tuesday I believe.

59:55.008 --> 59:57.178
[Robin] It was postmarked on the 8th.
I've got it here.

59:57.260 --> 59:58.100
You got the letter?

59:58.637 --> 01:00:01.467
[Robin] No, not the letter,
but I have the information on the letter.

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:07.524
[man] Interesting. So, there's a log
of it being turned over as evidence,

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:08.734
but there's no--

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:11.944
There's no indication
of what was inside of it or what--?

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:15.026
-It doesn't say what the letter said?
-[Robin] No.

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:21.742
It says there was an envelope
addressed to Ms. Marilyn...

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:26.001
with Cathy's handwriting.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:39.094
I mean,
if they came into possession of it,

01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:41.257
it should be somewhere.

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:42.926
It should've been kept.

01:00:55.694 --> 01:01:00.284
[Gemma] <i>What I'm looking at</i>
<i>is the autopsy report from Cathy Cesnik,</i>

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:06.286
and it's my understanding that,
aside from the police and Cathy's family,

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:09.251
that nobody else has had a chance
to look at this.

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:14.252
<i>I received this from Cathy's sister.</i>

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.382
<i>Marilyn's never read this,</i>

01:01:17.465 --> 01:01:22.675
<i>and she wants this information</i>
<i>to be public information</i>

01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:27.482
because she feels like it's important,
I guess, for people to do what I did,

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:33.149
just analyze this against what I know
about the situation,

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:37.441
measuring it against what we already
have found out from other people.

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:44.279
<i>Last year, we had the opportunity to talk</i>
<i>to James Scannell,</i>

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:49.921
<i>the supervising officer on duty</i>
<i>the day that Cathy's body was found.</i>

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:54.502
James Scannell said
there were no maggots on Cathy's body.

01:01:55.754 --> 01:02:01.184
<i>Jean Wehner has told us</i>
<i>that she was taken to see Cathy's body</i>

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:05.385
<i>and that there were maggots</i>
<i>on Cathy's face.</i>

01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:15.899
[Tom] <i>I have had police cold-case</i>
<i>investigators snicker and laugh.</i>

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:21.030
I remember the line, I think,
from one cold-case investigator to me was,

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:25.162
"Let's just say that Jane Doe
has a poor memory, okay?

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:28.542
She dreamed things
that could not have occurred.

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:31.410
Cold weather does not allow for maggots."

01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:38.763
[man] People always tell us
that the Baltimore County Police

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:43.468
say that some of the details
of Jane Doe's recount

01:02:43.551 --> 01:02:45.391
weren't possible or weren't true.

01:02:45.804 --> 01:02:49.644
So, I often wonder,
when Jane Doe came forward in 1994

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:53.904
<i>and said Father Maskell took her</i>
<i>to see the body of Sister Cathy,</i>

01:02:53.979 --> 01:02:56.309
if the Baltimore County Police,
have always thought

01:02:56.398 --> 01:02:59.028
her story doesn't make sense.

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:05.117
I really can't comment on, you know,
the credibility of that witness...

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:07.993
<i>relative to another investigator.</i>

01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:10.406
<i>I never spoke to her.</i>
<i>I never interviewed her.</i>

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:13.371
[man]
<i>One of the details that she always said</i>

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:16.496
<i>about Sister Cathy's body being found</i>
<i>was that...</i>

01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:20.757
<i>she wiped maggots</i>
<i>off of her face when she saw it,</i>

01:03:20.839 --> 01:03:24.629
<i>and what we've always heard</i>
<i>is that that was always discredited</i>

01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:28.508
because maggots would not be present
in the winter.

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:30.928
Does that come up in the records at all?

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:32.684
[Childs] <i>It's in the autopsy...</i>

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:38.322
<i>that there were maggots internally,</i>
<i>in the trachea and in the mouth.</i>

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:41.031
That's true.

01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:49.743
[Spitz] <i>When a fly lays an egg,</i>

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:54.366
<i>in a day, the egg is converted</i>
<i>into a living, moving maggot.</i>

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:56.208
A tiny maggot.

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:58.837
The maggot grows in one week--

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:02.088
In seven days,
the maggot grows to about an inch.

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:09.259
And flies don't... propagate
in the wintertime.

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:12.894
[Gemma] <i>This is November 7th.</i>

01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:17.444
When Sister Cathy first disappeared,
55 degrees.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.570
November 9th, 57.

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:23.189
The line graph is going up.

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:27.661
Well, the fact that there were maggots
is indisputable.

01:04:28.239 --> 01:04:30.159
<i>If I said maggots, there were maggots.</i>

01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:36.081
So, there must have been some sunny
and warmer days.

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:42.003
[Gemma]
We continued to get warmer and warmer.

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:45.666
Monday was 62 degrees.

01:04:45.757 --> 01:04:46.837
Oh, my God.

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:53.888
<i>I always believed Jean,</i>
<i>but this is clear evidence right here</i>

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:58.143
<i>that what she says she saw</i>
<i>was definitely there.</i>

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.898
<i>The truth is here in black and white.</i>
