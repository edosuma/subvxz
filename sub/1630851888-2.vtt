35:00.915 --> 35:02.766
- I am here looking
for a wedding suit.

35:02.843 --> 35:04.434
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

35:04.586 --> 35:07.495
- Congratulations.
- I'm looking for--

35:07.514 --> 35:08.663
I want traditional,

35:08.682 --> 35:10.440
But with a little splash
with it.

35:10.517 --> 35:11.608
Right? So I wanna--

35:11.759 --> 35:12.758
I don't want to be too--

35:12.778 --> 35:14.185
- He wants it flamboyant.

35:14.338 --> 35:17.614
- I don't want
nothing flamboyant.

35:17.691 --> 35:21.601
Like, I don't need tie-dyed
or, like--

35:21.620 --> 35:24.454
Little traditional, but with a
little splash of color, just--

35:24.531 --> 35:25.697
Just to make it pop.

35:25.849 --> 35:27.124
<i> I'm ready to get married.</i>

35:27.200 --> 35:28.700
<i> You know, being a firefighter,</i>

35:28.852 --> 35:31.128
<i> It can be lonely at times,</i>
<i> coming home.</i>

35:31.204 --> 35:33.630
And having a wife to come to

35:33.781 --> 35:37.783
After, you know, a 24-hour
shift, would be great,

35:37.803 --> 35:40.545
Just to talk to her about,
not work-related stuff,

35:40.697 --> 35:43.531
But things to get me
off of work.

35:43.550 --> 35:47.035
<i> Somebody warm to hug,</i>
<i> or somebody to be goofy with,</i>

35:47.037 --> 35:48.645
<i> Somebody to make jokes with.</i>

35:48.796 --> 35:50.538
That's something that
I'm looking forward to.

35:50.557 --> 35:53.150
That's something that
I definitely want in my life.

35:53.301 --> 35:56.469
- This is your classic black,
two-button notch.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.321
Then, next to that, is--

35:58.473 --> 36:00.640
We call that our ink blue,

36:00.659 --> 36:01.992
Which is really sharp.

36:02.143 --> 36:03.994
- I like that one.
Actually, that's popping out.

36:04.145 --> 36:05.996
Especially with the--
what's that, champagne?

36:06.072 --> 36:07.572
- That is exactly champagne.
Yes, sir.

36:07.724 --> 36:09.166
- So that--that'll be ideal,

36:09.317 --> 36:11.576
Because I don't know
what she's gonna be wearing.

36:11.728 --> 36:14.337
So I feel like
champagne is safe,

36:14.489 --> 36:16.506
Whether she's wearing hot pink

36:16.658 --> 36:19.676
Or, you know, tangerine.

36:19.827 --> 36:22.570
- So I just have to know
a little bit more

36:22.589 --> 36:25.164
About this hunt for this dream
dress

36:25.184 --> 36:26.241
You are looking for.
- Yes.

36:26.259 --> 36:27.575
So, like--
- what, like--

36:27.577 --> 36:30.520
- This is so, not--this is no.

36:30.597 --> 36:32.355
I don't like sparkly stuff.
- Okay.

36:32.507 --> 36:34.507
- And then long sleeve
is, like, non-negotiable.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.418
Long sleeves.
- No rhinestones.

36:36.436 --> 36:37.919
- No shiny stuff.
- No shiny.

36:37.921 --> 36:40.363
- I don't like it. And sheer.

36:40.515 --> 36:42.848
- Yes.
- And sheer.

36:42.868 --> 36:46.277
<i> - Being married at</i>
<i> first sight is big.</i>

36:46.430 --> 36:48.430
I could live
happily ever after.

36:48.448 --> 36:50.765
I could find the person
that I was meant to be with.

36:50.784 --> 36:52.542
<i> But it's scary.</i>

36:52.694 --> 36:54.878
<i> You know, I enjoy living</i>
<i> a certain lifestyle.</i>

36:54.955 --> 36:57.121
I'm not going
to change my lifestyle,

36:57.274 --> 36:59.774
As far as, like,
choosing to travel

36:59.793 --> 37:01.276
And being able
to enjoy nice things.

37:01.294 --> 37:02.868
Like, those are things
that I'm looking forward

37:02.888 --> 37:04.721
To having someone to do with.

37:04.872 --> 37:07.373
I don't like this.
Can you take this off?

37:07.392 --> 37:08.708
- These can probably come off.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.618
- They can?
- Yeah.

37:10.637 --> 37:11.786
- I know.
- I don't like that.

37:11.805 --> 37:13.713
I don't like the sleeves.
- It's too shiny.

37:13.732 --> 37:14.731
I mean, I would want
long sleeves.

37:14.882 --> 37:16.624
- Yeah, she wants sleeves.

37:16.626 --> 37:17.976
- Just try it.
- But I don't like--

37:18.128 --> 37:19.569
I'll try it,
but I don't like this.

37:19.721 --> 37:21.129
- You don't like what?

37:21.147 --> 37:22.313
- The ruching, the ruching.

37:22.466 --> 37:23.798
- Maybe you'll like it--
maybe you'll like it on.

37:23.817 --> 37:26.968
- Sure, yes.
- Sure, yes.

37:26.987 --> 37:28.078
- What is this?

37:28.229 --> 37:29.579
- Mm-mm.
- Oh, no.

37:29.656 --> 37:30.914
- Mm-mm.
- What about this?

37:30.991 --> 37:34.584
- This one is 3d.
So I want to try this one on.

37:34.736 --> 37:36.086
- This is 3d, you like this?
- I like this one.

37:36.162 --> 37:37.754
- No, I don't like those
cake flowers.

37:37.831 --> 37:40.924
- It's 3-d.
- Those look like cake flowers.

37:41.075 --> 37:44.594

38:07.694 --> 38:09.452

38:14.034 --> 38:15.292
All of it in a box.

38:15.368 --> 38:17.519
- So do you want to try
outside of the box?

38:17.537 --> 38:19.945
Outside of long sleeve?

38:19.965 --> 38:22.090
- Not really, I don't.
- Sexy.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.026

- No?

38:26.638 --> 38:29.806

- I look like a deacon.

38:29.957 --> 38:31.215

- Yes sir!

38:31.368 --> 38:32.475

- This is, like, I think--
when I see this,

39:50.780 --> 39:53.114
I think of a traditional bride.
That's just not me.

39:53.133 --> 39:54.891
- More--
- maybe more skin.

39:54.968 --> 39:56.451

39:56.453 --> 39:57.894
- I just feel like
it's so simple.

39:58.045 --> 39:59.712
- It's not the myrla swag.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.398
- It's not the myrla swag.
- Got it.

40:01.474 --> 40:03.141
All right. We gon' find it.

40:03.293 --> 40:05.402
- So in your head,
in your mind...

40:05.478 --> 40:06.644
- Yeah.
- When you see her coming down,

40:06.796 --> 40:09.964
What do you think
is all gonna happen? Like--

40:09.983 --> 40:11.799
- I haven't--
I've thought about it.

40:11.818 --> 40:14.577
You know, ideally,
perfect world,

40:14.654 --> 40:17.747
I think she hits that corner...
- Yeah.

40:17.899 --> 40:20.250
- With her dad or her mom,

40:20.401 --> 40:21.584
Whoever's gonna walk her
down the aisle...

40:21.661 --> 40:24.162
- Yep.
- And, like, we glance--

40:24.314 --> 40:25.329
We stare at each other,

40:25.482 --> 40:26.756
And we just
smile at each other.

40:26.833 --> 40:29.984
And--but a good smile, not,
like, a--

40:30.003 --> 40:31.761
- A creepy smile.
- You know what I'm saying?

40:31.913 --> 40:34.597
[all speaking at once]

40:34.674 --> 40:36.507
- When she see me,
when she lay her eyes on me,

40:36.660 --> 40:38.326
I want her to be like,
"oh, yeah.

40:38.344 --> 40:39.510
That's my man."
- yeah.

40:39.663 --> 40:40.770
- You know what I mean?
- Exactly.

40:40.847 --> 40:43.106
- Yeah, I want her
to be like, "yes."

40:43.183 --> 40:45.775
- Yeah.
- "they did a good job."

40:45.852 --> 40:48.111
- You're the ideal wife
in that dress.

40:48.262 --> 40:51.448
- Hush.
- Oh, my gosh.

40:51.524 --> 40:53.007
- How do you feel
in this dress?

40:53.009 --> 40:54.342
- I feel cute.

40:54.360 --> 40:55.510
- Just cute?

40:55.512 --> 40:57.512
- I feel sexy.

40:57.514 --> 40:58.771
- Sexy?
- I feel flawless.

40:58.790 --> 40:59.939
- Okay, there you go.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.440
- I think he'll be wowed.

41:01.460 --> 41:03.518
I have been
wanting to get married

41:03.520 --> 41:05.186
Since I was in school.

41:05.205 --> 41:07.297
<i> And I just want</i>
<i> to have a husband</i>

41:07.448 --> 41:09.299
<i> That I can grow with</i>
<i> and learn from,</i>

41:09.375 --> 41:11.526
<i> And I've always wanted</i>
<i> to have a family,</i>

41:11.544 --> 41:13.194
<i> Someone that I can pray with,</i>

41:13.213 --> 41:15.046
<i> Someone who I can</i>
<i> build traditions with,</i>

41:15.198 --> 41:16.473
<i> Because I didn't</i>
<i> have that growing up.</i>

41:16.549 --> 41:19.367
And so that's why
it's just so important for me.

41:19.385 --> 41:21.703
- What if your husband
doesn't like this dress?

41:21.721 --> 41:24.981
What if it's too sexy for him,
too revealing,

41:25.058 --> 41:28.726
And feels like that's not
for everybody to see?

41:28.878 --> 41:29.969
- Well, then
he's probably a little

41:29.988 --> 41:31.303
Too conservative for me.
- Too conservative.

41:31.323 --> 41:33.156
- He's gonna be very
unhappy with the rest

41:33.307 --> 41:35.216
Of the outfits that I have
picked out for brunch.

41:35.235 --> 41:37.827
- [laughs]

41:37.904 --> 41:39.554
- So what's something
that you excited

41:39.572 --> 41:43.725
That you don't have to
do alone, moving forward?

41:43.743 --> 41:48.579
- Uh, just having somebody
there to do things with.

41:48.732 --> 41:52.416
Parties and gatherings
and stuff like that, trips.

41:52.569 --> 41:55.345
- What if your wife is the type
that she likes to go, you know,

41:55.496 --> 41:58.256
On these real extravagant
trips to dubai, you know,

41:58.408 --> 41:59.741
Paris, you know?

41:59.759 --> 42:01.166
How you gonna approach that?

42:01.186 --> 42:02.501
- I'll be fine
with going there.

42:02.521 --> 42:04.354
I'll say that.

42:04.505 --> 42:10.193
But there's always ways around
making expensive trips cheaper.

42:10.344 --> 42:13.437
So it just depends.
Now, if she's materialistic,

42:13.590 --> 42:16.032
Then we gon'
have a little issue.

42:16.109 --> 42:17.534
'cause what's important to you?

42:17.685 --> 42:19.869
This $4,000 bag?
- Yeah.

42:20.021 --> 42:21.020
- Or the marriage?

42:21.039 --> 42:24.265

42:24.284 --> 42:26.042

like, a little bit?

57:12.671 --> 57:15.914

Like, physically.

57:37.938 --> 57:41.014
- I asked for tall,
dark, and handsome.

57:41.033 --> 57:41.957
- "tall, dark, and handsome"

57:42.034 --> 57:43.107
Can mean, like,
a lot of things.

57:43.127 --> 57:44.293

57:58.550 --> 58:00.476
- No.
- What if he is bald?

58:00.627 --> 58:02.627

<i> that he's not bald.</i>

58:06.208 --> 58:07.649

<i> Or that I wanted to date.</i>

58:09.561 --> 58:11.135

I am nervous about

58:11.155 --> 58:12.821
Is not necessarily him,

58:12.898 --> 58:15.491
But more so your expectations
of what you want.

58:15.642 --> 58:19.736
And if two or three
of those things aren't true,

58:19.888 --> 58:21.221
Then what does that mean?
You know?

58:21.223 --> 58:23.332
It can, like, set you up for--

58:23.483 --> 58:25.149

- Yeah.

So I'm concerned about that.

go for the kiss.

58:32.735 --> 58:35.326
She's my wife. Man, I don't--

58:35.346 --> 58:38.514
Look, she's a stranger,
but she's my wife.

58:38.665 --> 58:40.682
- Doesn't mean anything.
She's a stranger.

58:40.759 --> 58:42.518
- That means everything.
- She's still a stranger.

58:42.669 --> 58:43.910
- What do you mean
"that doesn't mean anything"?

58:43.929 --> 58:47.005
- She's still a stranger.

58:47.024 --> 58:48.932
- When it's time
to kiss the bride--

58:49.084 --> 58:50.917
"you may kiss your bride."
- no.

58:50.919 --> 58:52.176

- No?

58:52.196 --> 58:53.270

a kiss on the cheek.

58:53.422 --> 58:54.863
- What? Really?
- Yeah.

58:55.015 --> 58:57.366
- It's a stranger.
- You don't know this person.

58:57.442 --> 58:58.775
- What if he asks?

58:58.927 --> 59:00.369
- I said I can do
one on the cheek.

59:00.445 --> 59:01.853
