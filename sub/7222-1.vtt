01:18.319 --> 01:19.199
[Woman]: Shh...

01:20.319 --> 01:22.239
Go back to sleep.

01:22.319 --> 01:24.639
[boy moans softly]

01:37.279 --> 01:40.760
[Boy]: Once upon a time,
before I came,

01:40.839 --> 01:42.879
you cried and cried

01:42.959 --> 01:44.959
and watched TV all day,

01:45.040 --> 01:48.919
until you were a zombie,

01:49.000 --> 01:50.519
but then I zoomed down
from heaven

01:50.599 --> 01:51.919
through Skylight

01:52.000 --> 01:54.080
into Room.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.879
Whoosh-pshew!

01:56.959 --> 01:59.279
And I was kicking you
from the inside.

01:59.360 --> 02:01.760
Boom, boom!

02:01.839 --> 02:05.800
And then I shot out onto Rug
with my eyes wide open,

02:05.959 --> 02:09.639
and you cutt-ed the cord
and said, "Hello, Jack."

02:17.679 --> 02:19.479
Ma, I'm five!

02:27.240 --> 02:28.600
-You are.
-I'm so old now.

02:28.759 --> 02:30.240
You're such a big boy now.

02:30.520 --> 02:31.160
Yeah.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.119
Good morning, lamp.

02:33.919 --> 02:35.679
Good morning, plant.

02:37.039 --> 02:38.960
Good morning, Eggsnake.

02:39.039 --> 02:40.600
Good morning, rug.

02:40.679 --> 02:43.240
Good morning, wardrobe.

02:43.320 --> 02:46.320
Good morning, TV.

02:46.399 --> 02:47.559
Good morning, sink.

02:47.639 --> 02:49.919
Morning, toilet.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.720
Morning, everyone.

02:51.800 --> 02:52.800
Okay.

02:52.919 --> 02:53.960
It's my birthday.
I'm five.

02:54.039 --> 02:54.919
I get it.

02:57.440 --> 03:00.279
Take your vitamin.
It's the last one.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.720
Vitamins.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.000
[moans]

03:10.080 --> 03:11.559
-Is bad tooth hurting?
-Mm-hmm.

03:11.639 --> 03:12.960
But you know,

03:13.039 --> 03:15.440
mind over matter.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.000
If you don't mind,
it doesn't matter.

03:21.279 --> 03:22.520
You're right.

03:22.679 --> 03:24.240
Hey, do you know

03:24.320 --> 03:25.440
what we're gonna do today?

03:25.520 --> 03:27.240
What?

03:28.320 --> 03:31.279
We are going to bake
a birthday cake.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.639
A birthday cake?

03:32.800 --> 03:33.399
Mm-hmm.

03:33.600 --> 03:36.360
-Like in TV?
-Mm-hmm, but for real.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.080
No way!

03:38.360 --> 03:39.360
[laughs]

03:39.919 --> 03:41.479
The back.

03:42.839 --> 03:45.600
Now go, one, two, three.

03:45.720 --> 03:49.039
Four, five.
One, two, three, four, five--

03:49.119 --> 03:50.080
There you are.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.839
[television playing]

03:56.399 --> 03:57.720
I love you.

03:58.520 --> 03:59.759
Okay, TV off.

04:05.199 --> 04:07.919
I'm gonna grow and grow
until I'm a giant.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.839
Look, Ma, I'm strong as Samson.

04:09.919 --> 04:11.479
Yeah. You are.

04:11.559 --> 04:13.880
I'm going to be
Jack the Giant, Giant-Killer

04:14.000 --> 04:15.759
and burst out of Skylight
into space

04:15.839 --> 04:17.079
with my dog, Lucky,

04:17.238 --> 04:21.279
and boing, boing, boing
to all of the planets.

04:21.519 --> 04:23.160
Let's start with some stretch.

04:23.440 --> 04:26.079
Great job. Great job.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.600
Other leg, quickly.

04:30.920 --> 04:33.119
Switch legs. Hup.

04:37.839 --> 04:40.399
-Yeah.
-I'm doing it.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.359
-Yeah.
-I'm doing...

04:43.440 --> 04:46.119
jump, jump…

04:46.239 --> 04:47.320
like a frog.

04:47.399 --> 04:50.559
Feet back
and then do a push-up down.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.839
Up. Okay, time for track.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.200
Now this wall.

04:55.279 --> 04:56.959
Oh, I meant this wall.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.200
Did I say this wall?

04:58.279 --> 04:59.679
I meant this wall,

04:59.760 --> 05:01.119
but I actually meant,
I meant this wall,

05:01.200 --> 05:02.799
and this one,

05:02.880 --> 05:04.399
but this one needs it, too.

05:04.480 --> 05:08.359
[Music playing]

05:15.239 --> 05:17.040
Yeah!

05:18.320 --> 05:20.160
Mm.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.519
Oh, it's
a beautiful egg.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.040
Pretty good.

05:24.119 --> 05:25.320
Is that the batter?

05:25.399 --> 05:26.399
That's the batter.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.440
We're gonna add
some butter, too.

05:27.519 --> 05:28.640
How about that?

05:28.720 --> 05:30.399
-Butter!
-Urgh!

05:30.480 --> 05:32.839
-Ho, ho!
-Oh, yeah, mash that in.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.679
Well, we got it!

05:37.760 --> 05:39.600
Why don't you do some of that?

05:39.679 --> 05:42.279
-Can you... handle that?
-Yeah.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.519
Abracadabra!

06:01.920 --> 06:03.640
Now the candles!

06:03.720 --> 06:05.119
We don't have any candles.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.119
[moans]

06:07.200 --> 06:09.399
I know.

06:09.480 --> 06:11.720
You said a birthday cake,
for real.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.200
That means candles on fire.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.160
Jack…

06:17.279 --> 06:18.720
it's okay
without the candles.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.959
It's still a birthday cake.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.600
You should ask for candles
for a Sunday Treat,

06:23.679 --> 06:26.160
not dumb jeans.

06:26.239 --> 06:27.679
I'm sorry.

06:27.799 --> 06:29.559
You know, I have to ask
for stuff that we really need,

06:29.760 --> 06:31.359
stuff that he can get easily.

06:31.519 --> 06:33.839
But Old Nick gets anything,
by magic.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.440
Why don't we try your cake?

06:35.720 --> 06:37.679
No!

06:37.839 --> 06:39.040
Jack.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.760
Let's try a bite of it.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.359
I said, no!

06:48.640 --> 06:49.839
Come here.

06:54.920 --> 06:56.880
Next week when I'm six,

06:56.959 --> 06:58.839
you'd better ask
for real candles.

07:00.799 --> 07:02.399
Next year, you mean.

07:07.239 --> 07:11.399
[Ma]: And Edmond tears free
out of the bag,

07:11.559 --> 07:15.119
and swims and swims
to the island of Monte Cristo,

07:15.399 --> 07:17.239
and he digs up the treasure

07:17.399 --> 07:20.359
his friend
was telling him about.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.119
He buys a big yacht...

07:24.200 --> 07:27.600
and sails back to France,

07:27.679 --> 07:28.880
and when he gets there,

07:28.959 --> 07:30.799
he decides to buy the island,

07:30.880 --> 07:34.000
and call himself ”The Count,"

07:34.079 --> 07:35.679
and vows to take revenge

07:35.760 --> 07:38.000
on all of the people
that were mean to him.

07:50.079 --> 07:52.079
Can we have more birthday cake?

07:52.160 --> 07:53.119
Tomorrow.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.119
Just a bite?

07:57.160 --> 07:58.640
We brushed our teeth already.
[watch beeps]

07:58.720 --> 08:00.760
One last story?
Please.

08:00.839 --> 08:01.720
Come on, Jack.
It's late.

08:01.799 --> 08:03.399
Let's go to bed.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.160
[Jack]: Sing.

08:23.600 --> 08:28.000
One evening
when the sun went down

08:28.079 --> 08:32.000
And the jungle fire
was burning

08:32.080 --> 08:35.400
Down the tracks
came a hobo hiking

08:35.479 --> 08:38.880
And he said
"Boys, I'm not turning

08:38.960 --> 08:42.840
"I'm headed for a land
that's far away

08:42.919 --> 08:46.640
"Beside the crystal fountain

08:46.719 --> 08:48.679
"Oh, come with me

08:48.840 --> 08:54.679
Go and see
the Big Rock Candy Mountain"

08:56.320 --> 09:00.280
In the Big Rock
Candy Mountain

09:00.440 --> 09:03.520
There's a land
that's clear and bright...

09:06.559 --> 09:08.479
[rumbling]

09:11.080 --> 09:13.840
[beeping]

09:13.960 --> 09:16.119
[door opens and closes]

09:19.400 --> 09:22.479
-[Man]: Here's his jeans.
-[Ma]: Thanks.

09:22.679 --> 09:28.239
[Man]: Grapes were way too much,
so I got you canned pears.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.359
What's that?
Is it a birthday cake?

09:39.440 --> 09:40.919
[Ma]: Mm.

09:48.479 --> 09:51.239
[Man]:
Mm. You should have told me.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.280
I'd have got him a present.

09:56.559 --> 09:58.799
So, uh, how old is he anyway?
Four?

10:00.039 --> 10:01.679
Five.

10:26.359 --> 10:30.159
One, two, three...

10:30.799 --> 10:31.719
[Jack]:
There's Room,

10:31.799 --> 10:34.440
then Outer Space,

10:34.520 --> 10:36.960
with all the TV planets,

10:37.039 --> 10:38.880
then Heaven.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.440
Plant is real,
but not trees.

10:46.559 --> 10:49.080
Spiders are real,

10:49.159 --> 10:52.320
and one time the mosquito
that was sucking my blood.

10:52.440 --> 10:56.440
But squirrels and dogs
are just TV,

10:56.520 --> 10:58.000
except Lucky.

10:58.159 --> 11:01.119
He's my dog
who might come some day.

11:02.479 --> 11:04.559
Monsters are too big
to be real,

11:04.640 --> 11:07.520
and the sea.

11:07.599 --> 11:11.960
TV persons are flat
and made of colours.

11:12.760 --> 11:16.479
But me and you are real.

11:16.640 --> 11:17.640
Old Nick...

11:17.719 --> 11:20.400
I don't know if he's real.

11:20.479 --> 11:23.280
Maybe half.

11:23.359 --> 11:27.080
...47, 48, 49.

11:27.159 --> 11:29.960
50,51...

11:40.880 --> 11:42.599
[Ma]: Shh...

12:02.039 --> 12:08.039
[Mm]

12:53.320 --> 12:55.039
Oh.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.679
What is it?

13:01.760 --> 13:04.559
It's a bad tooth.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.080
Mm-hmm.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.719
Can I hold it?

13:16.679 --> 13:17.880
Wow!

13:52.400 --> 13:57.479
[Mm]

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
[Mm]

14:27.320 --> 14:28.400
[Smack!]

14:30.280 --> 14:32.200
[Jack]: You made him gone!

14:33.359 --> 14:34.599
He was an alive thing.

14:34.840 --> 14:35.960
He was real!

14:36.159 --> 14:38.159
He would have stolen our food.

14:38.239 --> 14:39.599
Mouse can have my food.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.159
I'm not hungry.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.239
He would have brought in germs,
bit us in our sleep.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.880
Mouse is my friend,

14:48.039 --> 14:49.679
and you splattered him dead.

14:49.880 --> 14:50.799
No, I didn't.

14:50.960 --> 14:52.400
He's hunky-dory.

14:52.679 --> 14:54.239
Are you tricking me?

14:54.400 --> 14:56.080
No, Jack, I swear.

14:56.239 --> 14:59.440
He is safe at home
in the backyard with his Ma.

15:00.080 --> 15:01.840
What backyard?

15:01.919 --> 15:04.479
Mouse lives in a yard in TV?

15:04.640 --> 15:07.679
Here, why don't you make a UFO
out of this?

15:11.400 --> 15:14.159
Why you didn't tell Old Nick
it was my birthday?

15:14.440 --> 15:16.239
Because he's not our friend.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.640
He said he'd bring me a present.

15:17.719 --> 15:19.159
You're not supposed
to be listening to that.

15:19.239 --> 15:20.479
You're supposed to be asleep.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.239
I never had a present.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.000
Well, he didn't mean it.

15:24.599 --> 15:26.400
It might be my dog, Lucky.

15:26.479 --> 15:27.919
Jack, we can't have a dog.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.200
There's not enough room--
space--

15:29.280 --> 15:30.320
there's not enough space,

15:30.400 --> 15:31.919
with the barking
and the scratching.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.239
Lucky won't scratch.

15:33.320 --> 15:34.320
He promises.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.559
There is no Lucky!

15:35.679 --> 15:37.159
Yes, there is!

15:37.239 --> 15:39.119
No, there's not.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.320
You made him up
in your head.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.400
He's not real.

15:47.359 --> 15:48.440
[sobs]

15:50.159 --> 15:51.280
Jack, I'm sorry.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.559
Come here, come here, come here.
I'm sorry.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.919
I'm sorry.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.359
You're right.
That wasn't nice.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.280
[television plays softly]

16:25.039 --> 16:26.799
Where do we go
when we're asleep?

16:26.960 --> 16:28.799
Right here in Room.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.559
But dreams--

16:31.640 --> 16:36.239
do we go to,
into TV for dreaming?

16:36.320 --> 16:37.640
Mm-mm.

16:37.719 --> 16:39.520
We're never anywhere
but here.

17:33.079 --> 17:34.560
Can I open it?

17:34.920 --> 17:35.880
Mm-hmm.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.439
Yes!

17:49.719 --> 17:52.560
[Jack screaming]

17:55.079 --> 17:57.880
[screams again]

18:01.280 --> 18:04.160
[screams again]

18:08.680 --> 18:10.560
Why the aliens
never scream back?

18:10.640 --> 18:13.479
I guess
they still can't hear us.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.439
We'll do it even louder, okay?

18:15.640 --> 18:16.599
Okay.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.560
[Jack screams]

18:22.760 --> 18:24.239
I'll kill you!

18:24.319 --> 18:27.359
Would you like to kill me now?

18:29.599 --> 18:31.439
Ma, he's attacking me!

18:31.599 --> 18:32.800
Oh, no!

18:33.800 --> 18:36.079
Got you. Ow!

18:36.160 --> 18:37.599
Ow!

18:40.560 --> 18:42.280
Ma, what smells bad?

18:44.719 --> 18:46.640
Fuck.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.520
Ugh.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.239
Shh...

19:02.959 --> 19:05.479
[door opens]

19:08.319 --> 19:09.719
[Man]: What's that smell?

19:09.800 --> 19:11.800
[Ma]:
Sorry, I burned some cheese.

19:11.880 --> 19:15.239
-Here.
-I just wasn't thinking.

19:15.359 --> 19:18.040
[Man]: Well, thinking
is not your strong suit.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.880
[Ma]: I know.

19:22.839 --> 19:23.520
[Man]: Yeah.

19:23.719 --> 19:26.160
[Ma]: Why don't you sit down?

19:27.560 --> 19:29.400
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

19:34.479 --> 19:36.439
So how did he
like his truck?

19:38.959 --> 19:40.439
Yeah?

19:41.839 --> 19:42.959
[Man]: Yeah.

19:43.719 --> 19:45.319
I know boys.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.439
The vitamins.

19:52.719 --> 19:53.599
Ah, it's a waste
of money.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.439
There's nothing in them.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.560
Well, if we had a better diet.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.439
Oh, fuck,
here we go again.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.680
Maybe if you could
stop complaining

20:01.760 --> 20:03.280
and be a little grateful.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.319
[Ma]: Thank you.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.800
[Man]: God, it's fucking
pulling teeth sometimes.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.800
Thank you for everything.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.719
You just have no idea
about the world of today.

20:19.839 --> 20:22.239
-No:

20:22.319 --> 20:23.839
[Man]: Who pays the power bill?

20:23.920 --> 20:25.199
Who pays for everything?

20:25.280 --> 20:26.400
-You.
-Mm-hmm.

20:26.479 --> 20:27.479
[Man]: And how do you think

20:27.680 --> 20:29.520
I'm gonna be able
to keep doing that?

20:30.719 --> 20:32.560
What do you mean?

20:34.680 --> 20:36.119
Nothing.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.239
No, but what
does that mean?

20:38.319 --> 20:40.239
Six months.
I've been laid off.

20:40.359 --> 20:42.079
Six months.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.280
Yeah.

20:43.359 --> 20:45.199
If you had to worry
your little head--

20:45.280 --> 20:47.160
What are you gonna do about it?

20:50.199 --> 20:51.400
Are you looking for a job?

20:51.680 --> 20:52.839
There are no fucking jobs!

20:53.040 --> 20:54.520
Jesus.

21:00.000 --> 21:00.920
Hey there.

21:01.079 --> 21:03.000
He's asleep.

21:03.079 --> 21:04.760
I don't think so.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.760
Do you keep him in the closet
all day as well as all night?

21:17.520 --> 21:19.880
What, does the little freak
got two heads or something?

21:20.160 --> 21:20.880
Hey.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.800
-Hey.
-Shh.

-Come to bed.
-Hey, Jack.

21:26.839 --> 21:27.760
-Hey.
-Let's go to bed.

21:29.959 --> 21:32.079

21:32.800 --> 21:34.599
Come on out and get some candy.

23:37.359 --> 23:39.839
Quit the noise.
Quit the noise.

Do you want to breathe?

23:41.239 --> 23:42.199
Yeah?

23:42.280 --> 23:43.760
Do you want to breathe?

23:43.959 --> 23:45.239

-Don't touch him.

-Are you okay?
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.319
-It's okay.
-I won't do it again.

24:38.680 --> 24:39.599

Hmm.

Hey, Jack,
do you remember Mouse?

26:15.479 --> 26:16.280
Yeah.

26:16.880 --> 26:17.800
Yeah?

26:19.119 --> 26:21.439
You know where he is?

26:24.800 --> 26:26.920
Hmm.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.640
I do.

26:32.599 --> 26:34.400
He's on the other side
of this wall.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.520
What other side?

26:37.880 --> 26:39.119
Jack, there's two sides
to everything.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.520
Not on an octagon.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.560
Yeah, but--

26:42.680 --> 26:44.239
An octagon has eight sides.

26:44.319 --> 26:47.959
But a wall, okay,
a waII's like this, see?

26:48.040 --> 26:49.119
And we're on the inside

26:49.199 --> 26:51.199
and Mouse is on the outside.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.000
In Outer Space?

26:53.160 --> 26:54.400
No, in the world.

26:54.719 --> 26:56.160
It's much closer
than Outer Space.

26:56.239 --> 26:59.280
I can't see the outside-side.

26:59.359 --> 27:01.280
Listen, I know that I told you
something else before,

27:01.359 --> 27:03.040
but you were much younger.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.239
I didn't think
that you could understand,

27:04.319 --> 27:06.400
but now you're so old,
you're so smart.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.880
I know that you can get this.

27:11.560 --> 27:14.079
Where do you think
that Old Nick gets our food?

27:14.319 --> 27:15.520
From TV by magic.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.719
There is no magic.

27:18.359 --> 27:19.479
What you see on TV,

27:19.560 --> 27:20.959
those are pictures
of real things,

27:21.040 --> 27:22.359
of real people.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.160
It's real stuff.

27:24.920 --> 27:26.640
Dora's real, for real?

27:26.800 --> 27:28.959
No, that's a drawing.

27:29.119 --> 27:30.959
Dora is a drawing.

27:31.199 --> 27:33.040
But other people,

27:33.199 --> 27:35.400
they have faces like us.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.520
Those are pictures
of real things,

27:37.599 --> 27:38.719
and all the other stuff
you see on there,

27:38.800 --> 27:40.640
that's real, too.

27:40.800 --> 27:43.560
That's real oceans, real trees,
real cats, dogs.

27:43.760 --> 27:44.439
No way.

27:44.599 --> 27:45.880
Where would they all fit?

27:46.119 --> 27:47.760
They just do.
They just fit.

27:47.920 --> 27:50.640
They just fit
out in the world.

27:51.479 --> 27:53.719
Jack, come on, you're so smart.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.079
I know that you've been
wondering about this.

27:58.239 --> 28:00.640
Can I have something else
to eat?

28:05.239 --> 28:06.040
There's a leaf.
Do you see that?

28:06.119 --> 28:07.160
Where?

28:07.239 --> 28:09.800
-Look.
-I don't see a leaf.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.719
Come here.
I want you to see.

28:14.199 --> 28:15.359
You can have a closer look.

28:16.640 --> 28:17.599
You see that?

28:17.800 --> 28:18.520
See?

28:18.680 --> 28:19.920
Dumbo Ma.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.359
That's not a leaf.
Leaves are green.

28:22.439 --> 28:23.439
Yeah, on trees,

28:23.520 --> 28:24.400
but then they fall,
and they rot,

28:24.479 --> 28:25.760
like salad
in the fridge.

28:25.839 --> 28:27.599
Where's all the stuff
you said?

28:27.680 --> 28:31.160
Trees, and dogs,
and cats, and grass?

28:31.239 --> 28:32.520
We can't see it from here

28:32.599 --> 28:34.599
because Skylight looks upwards
instead of sideways.

28:34.680 --> 28:35.560
You're just tricking me.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.040
No, I'm not.

28:37.119 --> 28:39.479
Liar, liar, pants on fire!

28:39.560 --> 28:41.040
Jack.

28:41.119 --> 28:42.599
I couldn't explain it before,
because you were too small.

28:42.680 --> 28:43.760
You were too small
to understand,

28:43.839 --> 28:46.239
so I had to make up a story,
but--

28:46.319 --> 28:48.040
but now I'm doing the opposite,
okay?

28:48.119 --> 28:49.199
I'm doing the opposite of lying.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.040
I am un-lying,
because you're five now.

28:51.439 --> 28:52.680
You're five,

28:52.839 --> 28:53.400
and you're old enough

28:53.800 --> 28:54.640
to understand
what the world is.

28:54.839 --> 28:55.839
You have to understand.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.479
You have to understand.

wasn't always in Wonderland?

29:14.719 --> 29:16.800
She fell down, down, down,
deep in a hole.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.520

I wasn't always in Room.

29:18.599 --> 29:19.719
I'm like Alice.

I was a little girl
named Joy.

29:21.439 --> 29:22.640
Nah!

29:23.680 --> 29:26.280
And I lived in a house
with my mom and my dad.

29:26.439 --> 29:28.359
You would call them
Grandma and Grandpa.

29:28.439 --> 29:30.000
What house?

29:30.079 --> 29:32.199
A house.
It was in the world.

29:32.280 --> 29:33.239
And there was a backyard,

29:33.319 --> 29:34.680
and we had a hammock,

29:34.760 --> 29:35.880
and we would swing
in the hammock,

29:35.959 --> 29:36.839
and we would eat
ice cream.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.640

29:38.719 --> 29:39.880
No, Jack,

-I was walking home from school-
-Where was I?

29:49.040 --> 29:49.920
You were still up in heaven.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.040
But there was a guy.

29:51.160 --> 29:51.880
He pretended that
his dog was sick.

29:51.959 --> 29:52.880
What guy?

29:52.959 --> 29:54.160
Old Nick.

29:54.239 --> 29:55.199
We call him "Old Nick."

29:55.280 --> 29:58.000
I don't know
what his real name is.

29:58.079 --> 29:59.359
But he pretended
his dog was sick--

29:59.439 --> 30:02.400
-What's the dog's name?
-Jack, there wasn't a dog.

30:03.640 --> 30:06.239
He was trying to trick me, okay?

30:07.479 --> 30:08.760
There wasn't a dog.
Old Nick stole me.

30:08.839 --> 30:10.680
I want a different story!

30:10.760 --> 30:13.119
No! This is the story
that you get.

30:16.920 --> 30:18.160
He put me
in his garden shed.

30:18.239 --> 30:18.760
Here.

30:18.839 --> 30:21.160
Room is the shed.

30:21.239 --> 30:22.880

30:22.959 --> 30:24.920

that knows the code--

30:25.000 --> 30:26.160
you know, the secret numbers
that open the door?

30:26.280 --> 30:27.719
He's the only one that knows,

30:27.800 --> 30:29.800
and I've been locked in here
for seven years.

It's so big,

one stinky part of it.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.079
Room's not stinky.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.800

30:48.959 --> 30:52.199
I don't believe
in your stinky world!

32:44.640 --> 32:46.479
because he's more blobbier.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.959
Labyrinth is the twistiest

32:49.040 --> 32:51.640
and she hides things
so I don’t know where they are.

32:51.839 --> 32:55.199
Toilet’s the best
at disappearing poo.

32:55.839 --> 32:57.400
Lamp 's the brightest,

32:57.479 --> 33:00.359
except when the power’s cut.

33:00.439 --> 33:02.680
You're the best at reading
and songs and lots,

33:02.839 --> 33:06.160
except if you're having
a Gone Day.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.959
I'm the best at drawing,
and jumping, and growing,

33:09.160 --> 33:10.680
and nearly everything!

33:44.000 --> 33:48.880

[TV playing softly]

35:13.800 --> 35:15.479
Are turtles real?

35:17.199 --> 35:20.040
Yeah. They're totally real.

35:20.239 --> 35:22.199
I had a turtle as a pet.

35:22.439 --> 35:25.840
Crocodiles and sharks?

35:26.000 --> 35:27.560
Yeah, they're all real.

35:34.120 --> 35:35.199
Real?

35:37.159 --> 35:38.600
Sort of.

35:38.679 --> 35:44.399
So, these are real people,
but they're playing dress-up.

35:44.479 --> 35:45.760
They're pretending

35:45.919 --> 35:48.639
that they're people
from hundreds of years ago.

35:52.800 --> 35:56.199
Just TV?

35:57.040 --> 35:58.800
You're getting it.

36:00.360 --> 36:01.719
When Old Nick comes back,

36:01.959 --> 36:03.560
I'm gonna kick him in the butt.

36:09.919 --> 36:12.320
Let me tell you something.

36:12.399 --> 36:13.560
You know, one time,

36:13.719 --> 36:16.159
I tried to kick Old Nick
in the butt.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.239
I hid behind the door,

36:18.399 --> 36:21.080
and I was holding the lid
from the toilet tank.

36:21.159 --> 36:23.320
There used to be a lid on it.

36:23.399 --> 36:25.239
It was the heaviest thing
in Room.

36:25.320 --> 36:26.639
When he came in,

36:26.719 --> 36:28.399
I smashed it on his head,

36:28.479 --> 36:31.439
but I messed up.

36:31.560 --> 36:35.719
He shoved the door closed,
and he grabbed me by the wrist.

36:35.800 --> 36:38.800
That's why it's sore now.

36:38.879 --> 36:39.959
We could wait
‘til he's asleep

36:40.040 --> 36:40.959
and kill him dead.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.280
Yeah, we could, but...

36:43.360 --> 36:45.560
then what?

36:45.639 --> 36:47.399
We'd run out of food

36:47.560 --> 36:49.199
and we don't know the code
to the door.

36:49.439 --> 36:51.679
Hey, the Grandma and the Grandpa
could come.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.840
Jack, they don't know
where we are.

36:56.040 --> 36:58.679
Room's not on any map.

37:03.399 --> 37:05.479
Jack, listen to me.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.439
Now, we've got a chance.

37:07.679 --> 37:10.959
We've nearly missed it,
but we've got our chance.

37:12.120 --> 37:13.520
So you're gonna help me.

37:13.679 --> 37:17.080
You're gonna help me
trick Old Nick.

37:19.719 --> 37:20.919
I don't get it.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.879
I'm going to make
your face so hot,

37:22.959 --> 37:24.399
that Old Nick will have to
take you to the hospital

37:24.479 --> 37:25.439
in his truck,

37:25.520 --> 37:26.719
and then when you get there,

37:26.879 --> 37:28.919
you're gonna say to the doctors,
"Help! Police!"

37:29.280 --> 37:31.199
Well, maybe next year
when I'm six.

37:31.280 --> 37:32.439
Tonight.

37:32.600 --> 37:35.479
It has to be tonight, Jack.

37:35.679 --> 37:38.800
We'll tell Old Nick
that because of the power cut,

37:39.000 --> 37:40.360
you got so cold,
that you got a fever.

37:40.439 --> 37:42.040
Tomorrow, please.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.399
No. I'm your Ma,

37:43.560 --> 37:46.159
so, sometimes, I have to pick
for the both of us.

37:47.239 --> 37:48.239
Ow!

37:48.320 --> 37:49.719
It's okay.
It's okay.

37:49.800 --> 37:50.639
You've got
to stay floppy.

37:50.719 --> 37:51.840
Okay?

37:51.919 --> 37:53.040
Stay floppy,

37:53.199 --> 37:54.520
and you're not going to move
or say a word.

37:54.679 --> 37:56.040
You're too weak, okay?

37:59.479 --> 38:01.639
Ew, what are you doing?

38:01.959 --> 38:02.840
What are you doing?

38:02.919 --> 38:04.320
[vomiting]

38:04.399 --> 38:05.439
Sorry.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.879
I've just got to make you
smell sick.

38:07.959 --> 38:09.600
Good. That's good.

38:09.679 --> 38:11.239
Show me how--

38:11.320 --> 38:12.520
Show you me how

38:12.600 --> 38:13.439
you're gonna pull the note
out of your pocket.

38:13.520 --> 38:14.439
Show me the note.
Come on.

38:14.520 --> 38:15.399
When you're at the hospital...

38:15.479 --> 38:18.879
Show me.
What's this?

38:19.000 --> 38:21.199
What's that? Oh.

38:23.199 --> 38:27.000
You see? You've got a bit of me
all the time.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.919
Okay. Put it
back in your pocket.

38:31.399 --> 38:32.840
Okay, good.

38:32.919 --> 38:34.600
Okay.

38:34.679 --> 38:36.159
And you've got your strong, too.

38:36.239 --> 38:37.280
Okay?

38:37.399 --> 38:39.040
I'm scared.

38:39.239 --> 38:40.639
I know.

38:42.280 --> 38:43.560
Come on.

39:33.199 --> 39:35.360
You know the drill.

39:35.439 --> 39:36.959
Not a peep ‘til the door's shut.

39:37.080 --> 39:38.080
Sorry. lt's--

39:38.159 --> 39:39.679
Jack's sick.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.600
It was so cold.

39:43.320 --> 39:44.520
Well, you brought
that on yourself.

39:44.600 --> 39:45.719
Well, I couldn't
keep him warm,

39:45.800 --> 39:47.719
and now he's burning up.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.600
Give him some of
those painkillers.

39:49.800 --> 39:53.760
I tried, but he just keeps
puking them back up.

39:56.959 --> 39:59.479
Don't. Don't!

40:07.639 --> 40:09.120
Stay still.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.840
Jesus, he's on fire.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.320
Okay, well I'll get him
something stronger.

40:15.399 --> 40:16.560
But he--he's five.

40:16.639 --> 40:17.639
He's dehydrated.

40:17.719 --> 40:18.919
He has a fever.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.120
He could go into convulsions
at any minute.

40:20.199 --> 40:21.919
Just shut up
and let me think!

40:22.040 --> 40:24.360
Okay. All right. Okay.

40:24.439 --> 40:25.760
I'II-- I'll get him some
tomorrow night.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.520
No! He-- you need to take him
to the E.R. right now.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.000
Stop the hysterics.

40:29.080 --> 40:30.679
Please, I'm begging you!

40:41.199 --> 40:42.840
Am I still gonna go?

40:44.919 --> 40:46.719
No, not this time.

40:50.840 --> 40:52.600
It's okay.

41:31.959 --> 41:33.919
[Ma]:
So you remember how Edmond

41:34.000 --> 41:38.639
pulls his friend out of a bag
and hides him,

41:38.719 --> 41:41.159
and then he gets in the bag,

41:41.239 --> 41:42.439
and he lays in there
really still

41:42.520 --> 41:44.479
until the guards come?

41:47.840 --> 41:49.399
So that's
what you're going to do.

41:53.479 --> 41:55.000
You see?

41:55.080 --> 41:57.280
How that's even tricks-ier
than pretending to be sick,

41:57.360 --> 41:59.479
because you're gonna...

41:59.560 --> 42:01.159
Play dead.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.280
Folding over.

42:05.760 --> 42:07.560
I don't want to be dead.

42:07.840 --> 42:08.919
[Ma]: You're just
pretending to be dead.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.679
Stay stiff.

42:10.760 --> 42:13.719
We're gonna roll you up in Rug
so that Old Nick won't see you,

42:13.800 --> 42:15.040
won't see
that you're alive inside.

42:15.120 --> 42:17.399
Old Nick's
going to pick you up like this.

42:17.479 --> 42:19.120
Stay stiff, stiff, stiff.

42:19.239 --> 42:20.760
And, and you're not gonna be
wobbly and floppy this time.

42:20.840 --> 42:24.159
You're gonna be real stiff,
like a--like a robot.

42:24.280 --> 42:25.399
It's gonna shake.

42:25.639 --> 42:27.320
Now, that is what
it'll feel like.

42:27.399 --> 42:29.919
And that's when you know
that Old Nick's driving.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.320
That means he's busy,

42:31.399 --> 42:32.600
and so it's time
for you to roll.

42:32.679 --> 42:34.840
And you're not gonna
make a sound,

42:34.919 --> 42:36.120
and I'm gonna be there
in your head,

42:36.199 --> 42:37.479
talking to you the whole time.

42:37.560 --> 42:39.159
Come on.
Roll, roll, roll.

42:39.239 --> 42:40.040
Now, wiggle,
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.280
Get yourself out.

42:41.360 --> 42:42.639
[Jack]: I can’t. Stop!

42:42.719 --> 42:44.600
-Come on, Jack.
-Ma, I can't!

42:44.679 --> 42:46.120
And Old Nick's gonna come,

42:46.199 --> 42:47.719
and he's gonna pick you up
in the rug,

42:47.800 --> 42:49.040
and he's gonna
take you outside,

42:49.120 --> 42:51.800
and he's gonna put you
in his truck,

42:51.879 --> 42:55.360
and he's gonna...

42:55.439 --> 42:58.479
find a place to—
to lay you down.

43:00.399 --> 43:01.959
No.

43:06.479 --> 43:08.719
It'll be okay, though,

43:08.800 --> 43:10.760
because you're gonna wiggle out,

43:10.840 --> 43:11.840
and you're gonna run away.

43:11.959 --> 43:13.560
Head over here.

43:16.600 --> 43:18.120
Arms like this.

43:18.199 --> 43:19.639
Okay, there was
too many turns that time.

43:19.760 --> 43:20.919
I'll shorten the rug.

43:22.080 --> 43:23.000
Okay.

43:23.080 --> 43:24.120
Ooh.

43:26.280 --> 43:28.040
Roll, roll, roll!

43:28.120 --> 43:29.360
Roll, Jack, roll, come on!

43:29.439 --> 43:30.840
Roll.

43:30.919 --> 43:32.199
You've got it. Now wiggle,
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

43:32.280 --> 43:34.800
-Yes!
-I hate you!

43:35.959 --> 43:37.959
Okay, Okay.

43:45.600 --> 43:49.719
Truck, wiggle out, jump, run.

43:49.800 --> 43:51.679
Okay, you’ll jump,

43:51.760 --> 43:53.639
jump when you hit
the first stop sign,

43:53.800 --> 43:55.439
and the truck
rolls to a stop.

43:55.719 --> 43:58.280
And you're gonna shout
when you see somebody.

43:58.439 --> 44:02.320
You say, "My Ma is Joy Newsome."

44:02.760 --> 44:03.760
Who's Somebody?

44:03.919 --> 44:06.000
Anybody. It's the first person
that you see.

44:06.080 --> 44:07.040
An actual

44:07.120 --> 44:08.399
real-life person?

44:08.479 --> 44:10.399
Mm-hmm.

44:17.360 --> 44:19.360
What if Old Nick unwraps me?

44:19.639 --> 44:20.919
He won't.

44:22.360 --> 44:24.560
You got Bad Tooth?

44:24.760 --> 44:26.560
He's in here
so I don't lose him.

44:28.560 --> 44:30.159
You are amazing.

44:33.360 --> 44:35.199
And you're going to love it.

44:36.320 --> 44:37.520
What?

44:37.600 --> 44:41.439
The world.

44:41.520 --> 44:44.000
My house with the hammock

44:44.159 --> 44:46.280
and Grandma and Grandpa.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.239
And you?

44:52.719 --> 44:54.120
Yeah.

45:15.239 --> 45:17.239
[door thumps]

45:19.080 --> 45:21.600
Stay stiff.
I'm sorry, Jack.

45:21.679 --> 45:23.040
Stay stiff.

45:23.199 --> 45:25.280
You can do this.

45:25.439 --> 45:27.800
Antibiotics.

45:27.959 --> 45:29.000
What are you doing?

45:31.320 --> 45:33.360
He got worse in the night.

45:36.760 --> 45:37.800
He didn't wake up.

45:39.919 --> 45:42.919
Oh, jeez.

45:43.919 --> 45:45.919
You poor girl.

45:50.719 --> 45:52.600
Well, I guess it must have been
pretty serious.

45:52.840 --> 45:54.159
You killed my baby.

45:54.320 --> 45:55.399
Okay, take it easy.

45:55.560 --> 45:56.360
Okay, let me have a look.

45:56.520 --> 45:57.679
Don't touch him!

45:57.879 --> 45:58.959
Okay.

46:01.639 --> 46:02.840
Are you sure?

46:03.239 --> 46:04.719
Am I sure?

46:07.439 --> 46:09.199
Okay. Well, he can't stay here,
you know?

46:09.280 --> 46:10.679
[sobbing] No.

46:12.639 --> 46:14.000
Where are you gonna take him?

46:14.080 --> 46:14.719
I don't know.

46:14.800 --> 46:17.840
I, I'm thinking. Um...

46:17.919 --> 46:19.600
Somewhere nice.

46:19.679 --> 46:21.080
It can't be here.

46:21.159 --> 46:23.199
I'll feel him.

46:23.320 --> 46:24.360
Okay.

46:24.479 --> 46:26.280
Somewhere with trees.

46:26.600 --> 46:27.679
Trees, sure, yeah.

46:27.760 --> 46:29.520
I want to swear to me

46:29.600 --> 46:33.320
you won't even
lay your filthy eyes on him.

46:33.479 --> 46:35.679
Swear to me that
you won't look at him!

46:35.879 --> 46:37.520
I swear.

46:41.120 --> 46:42.879
Okay, well, it's about
an hour until dark.

46:43.120 --> 46:44.080
Now!

46:44.399 --> 46:45.679
I can't bear it.

46:45.959 --> 46:47.959
Okay, all right, all right.

46:51.360 --> 46:52.479
Gentle, please!

46:52.959 --> 46:54.399
Okay. Okay.

46:55.199 --> 46:57.199
Please!
Please, please, be gentle.

46:57.280 --> 46:58.719
[Man]: I got him now! I got him.
I got him.

47:01.080 --> 47:02.439
Step back.

47:03.560 --> 47:05.639
Face the wall.

47:35.000 --> 47:39.520

49:21.000 --> 49:22.560

51:37.000 --> 51:38.679
[Dog walker]: Oh! Boomer!

51:38.800 --> 51:40.639
I'm really sorry, man.
She just came out of nowhere.

51:40.760 --> 51:44.120
I'm-- hey, hey,
I'm really sorry.

51:44.199 --> 51:45.719
Is your little girl okay?

51:45.800 --> 51:46.840
It's under control.

51:46.919 --> 51:48.000
Okay.

51:48.080 --> 51:49.760
Has she been in
some kind of accident?

51:49.840 --> 51:50.040
Would you like me
to phone someone?

51:50.120 --> 51:52.919
Help!

51:53.000 --> 51:54.199
I'll take care of it.

51:54.280 --> 51:54.919
[Jack crying]

51:56.000 --> 51:57.159
What's that you've
got there, honey?

51:57.239 --> 51:58.479
Come on!

51:59.800 --> 52:01.360
Is that for me?

52:01.439 --> 52:03.399
Come on.

52:03.479 --> 52:05.399
Why don't you just
mind your own business?

52:05.479 --> 52:06.560
Ma!

52:06.639 --> 52:08.159
-I'm calling the cops, Mister--
-Help me!

52:08.239 --> 52:09.360
Fuck!

52:09.439 --> 52:11.080
[Dog walker]:
Hey, whoa, hey, hey!

52:12.399 --> 52:14.120
Come here. Sit.
Sit down.

52:14.959 --> 52:16.800
Hi, honey.

52:22.919 --> 52:25.000
This is Boomer.
He's not gonna hurt you.

52:25.159 --> 52:27.159
He's all gone now.
I'm gonna call somebody.

52:29.199 --> 52:31.120
[sirens approaching]

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
It was a red pick-up.

52:46.080 --> 52:46.959
She was running away
from this guy.

52:47.040 --> 52:48.280
He grabbed
her.

52:48.360 --> 52:50.199
-I tried to stop him and--
-[woman]: Thank you.

52:50.280 --> 52:52.600
[woman]: Hey. Hey, there.

52:52.679 --> 52:54.600
I'm Officer Parker.
Can you tell me your name?

52:56.320 --> 52:58.080
Hi.

52:58.159 --> 52:59.560
[whispers] Jack.

52:59.719 --> 53:01.840
Can you say that
a little louder for me?

53:15.040 --> 53:17.280
[Officer Parker]: Okay.

53:17.399 --> 53:22.000
So, um, do you...

53:22.080 --> 53:23.719
have another name?

53:26.639 --> 53:27.760
Jack?

53:29.120 --> 53:30.120
Okay, it's okay.

53:30.280 --> 53:33.439
Can you tell me how old you are?

53:34.719 --> 53:35.959
I'm five.

53:36.199 --> 53:37.560
Five?

53:37.719 --> 53:39.639
That's great, okay.

53:39.800 --> 53:43.080
Now, uh, can you tell me
where you live?

53:46.600 --> 53:47.879
[male officer]: Why don't
we call Child Services?

53:51.800 --> 53:53.800
Do you have a mom, Jack?

53:55.360 --> 53:56.399
Ma.

53:56.520 --> 53:58.040
[Officer Parker]: Okay, good.

53:58.120 --> 54:00.800
Does she have another name?

54:05.639 --> 54:07.320
I can't remember.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.840
Um, where's Ma right now?

54:12.800 --> 54:14.320
-Room.
-What room?

54:14.959 --> 54:17.000
Jack, where's this room?

54:19.439 --> 54:21.120
That guy with the truck,
is that your dad?

54:21.360 --> 54:23.600
Is that Ma's boyfriend?
Do you know him?

54:25.959 --> 54:27.560
What's that, Jack?

54:28.280 --> 54:29.560
A bit of Ma.

54:32.040 --> 54:33.000
That's okay, buddy.

54:33.080 --> 54:35.159
That's good.
Thank you, Jack.

54:35.239 --> 54:36.840
That's good.
You did real good, okay?

54:36.919 --> 54:38.399
You did good.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
So Jack,
anything you recognize, buddy?

54:48.080 --> 54:49.719
Jack, anything?

54:50.320 --> 54:52.280
Your room, Jack.

54:52.360 --> 54:54.639
What's outside the room?

54:56.600 --> 54:58.320
Space.

54:59.439 --> 55:01.199
No--the world.

55:01.280 --> 55:03.239
[male officer]: You think
the kid's on something?

55:04.879 --> 55:07.360
[Officer Parker]: Okay, listen,
when you step out the door...

55:08.800 --> 55:09.959
No? No, you don't?

55:10.040 --> 55:12.159
[Jack]: We don't know
how to open the door.

55:12.239 --> 55:13.560
[male officer]: My money's
on some kind of cult--

55:13.679 --> 55:15.439
the tooth, the long hair.

55:15.560 --> 55:17.760
Is there daylight in your room?

55:18.439 --> 55:19.840
Okay, good.
How many windows?

55:19.919 --> 55:21.280
Zero.

55:21.360 --> 55:23.399
[Officer Parker]: Well, then,
how does the sun come in?

55:23.479 --> 55:24.679
Through Skylight.

55:24.760 --> 55:26.080
Skylight?

55:26.159 --> 55:27.199
Okay, excellent.

55:27.399 --> 55:29.919
So you live in a house
with a skylight?

55:30.080 --> 55:31.080
No, it's not a house.

55:31.439 --> 55:32.639
Okay.

55:33.399 --> 55:34.760
-It's a...
-Yeah?

55:34.919 --> 55:36.159
It's a...

55:36.439 --> 55:38.040
Uh, you'd get more out of him
after he's had some sleep.

55:38.120 --> 55:39.120
Tom, give it a second.

55:39.199 --> 55:40.760
Room's a--a shed.

55:40.840 --> 55:43.000
A shed, Jack? A shed?

55:43.080 --> 55:44.080
Okay, good boy.

55:44.159 --> 55:45.439
Yeah, it's a needle
in a haystack.

55:45.520 --> 55:46.479
[Officer Parker]:
Okay, listen to me.

55:46.560 --> 55:49.199
What made you jump
out the truck, Jack?

55:49.280 --> 55:51.320
Ma said in my head.

55:51.479 --> 55:54.040
Okay, what exactly
did she say?

55:56.800 --> 55:59.040
Jump when it slows down,
but I couldn't.

55:59.120 --> 56:01.320
All right.
So, what did you do?

56:01.399 --> 56:04.000
What did you do?

56:05.199 --> 56:07.199
Third time, I got bent.

56:07.320 --> 56:10.199
The... third time
of what, Jack?

56:10.320 --> 56:11.320
Third slow.

56:11.399 --> 56:14.080
Everything went sideways,

56:14.199 --> 56:15.840
and then it stopped,
then I jumped...

56:15.919 --> 56:17.959
-I got it.
-...Into...

56:18.080 --> 56:19.080
I got it, buddy.
I got it.

56:19.159 --> 56:21.159
-54-09 call.
-Go ahead.

56:21.239 --> 56:23.239
Dispatch. Listen carefully.
We have a rough location.

56:23.320 --> 56:25.800
All right, uh, south on Elm,

56:25.919 --> 56:27.879
three stop signs
past the junction with Beech.

56:27.959 --> 56:30.760
Look for a garden shed
with a skylight.

56:30.840 --> 56:33.040
Also check the most recent
satellite images

56:33.120 --> 56:34.600

56:36.520 --> 56:38.040

-Okay, copy that, 54-09.

56:38.120 --> 56:40.719
[Officer Parker]:
Good boy, Jack.

56:40.800 --> 56:43.840
[Dispatch]: ...A possible
active hostage situation.

We are at 40019 Pine Street.

57:01.879 --> 57:03.399
[Officer Parker]:
Stay with the kid.

57:04.840 --> 57:06.479
[Tom]: Everything's
gonna be okay, Jack.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.040
Settle in.

57:10.399 --> 57:12.439
Hey, Parker, backyard.

Ma.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.399
Ma!

58:00.840 --> 58:03.959
Open the door! Open!

58:16.679 --> 58:19.000
-[Ma]: Jack! Where is he?
-Ma! Ma, I'm in this one!

59:21.719 --> 59:23.000
Ma.

59:23.080 --> 59:26.120
Can we go to bed?

59:26.199 --> 59:27.879
Yeah.

59:27.959 --> 59:31.679
They'll take us somewhere
to sleep soon.

59:31.760 --> 59:35.080
No, but Bed...

59:35.159 --> 59:36.800

-Ma! Ma!
-Oh.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
[Ma]: Good morning, sleepyhead.

01:02:26.919 --> 01:02:28.439
I was waiting
so long for you to wake up,

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.719
I fell asleep again.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.199
Are we on another planet?

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.760
Mm-mm.

01:02:33.879 --> 01:02:35.760
Same one, just a different spot.

01:02:37.399 --> 01:02:39.280
This one is...

01:02:41.239 --> 01:02:43.280
a bedroom in a hospital.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.360
Are we sick for real or pretend?

01:02:46.439 --> 01:02:47.800
We're not sick.

01:02:47.879 --> 01:02:49.600
We're the opposite
of sick.

01:02:49.719 --> 01:02:50.719
How long are we staying?

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:54.080
Not long.

01:02:54.159 --> 01:02:55.479
Grandma saw us last night,

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.399
and she's gonna get us
once they say we're okay.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.040
And Grandpa?

01:03:00.199 --> 01:03:01.639
He was away for work,

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.080
but he's on a plane
coming back home.

01:03:05.199 --> 01:03:07.679
I wetted the bed before.
I'm sorry.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:08.639
Yeah?

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.040
It was by accident.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:10.520
-It's okay.
-[phone rings]

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:13.520
Hello?

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.879
Yeah.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:18.360
Just now.

01:03:18.439 --> 01:03:20.760
Uh, yeah, that would be great.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.239
Can you bring it in 20 minutes?

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:24.959
Okay, thank you.

01:03:26.639 --> 01:03:28.159
Step out, okay.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.600
-Ma that's waste.
-We'll get you new ones.

01:03:35.679 --> 01:03:37.679
[Jack]: For Sunday Treat?

01:03:40.479 --> 01:03:43.679
[Ma]: There will be
so many treats,

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.399
and not just on Sunday.

01:03:49.639 --> 01:03:51.320
Ma, where's the bath?

01:03:54.239 --> 01:03:55.600
There's a shower.

01:03:55.679 --> 01:03:57.239
It's splashier.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.080
Jack, come here.

01:04:05.239 --> 01:04:06.600
That's us.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:10.560
Ma, will he find us?

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.560
No.

01:04:15.679 --> 01:04:17.159
He will never find us.

01:04:19.679 --> 01:04:21.919
Come on.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.919
Bath before bed.
That's the rule.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.399
There are no rules, Jack.

01:04:28.479 --> 01:04:29.879
We can do what we like.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.439
[moaning]

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.080
Are you hurting?

01:04:34.199 --> 01:04:37.120
No.

01:04:37.199 --> 01:04:38.159
You wanna come in?

01:04:38.239 --> 01:04:39.719
Mm-mm.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.800
[knocking]

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.919
Ma, the door's ticking.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.879
-[knocking]
-Hey, it's okay.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.000
-[Doctor]: Good morning.
-Hi.

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.760
Hey, it's okay.
Come on.

01:04:52.919 --> 01:04:55.600
So I hear
we're all awake now?

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.679
Yeah.

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.399
Just put it
right there.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.959
[Ma]: It's okay Jack.

01:05:02.239 --> 01:05:03.879
Hi, Jack.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.320
How are you doing?

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.439
[breathing heavily]

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.959
My name's Dr. Mittal,

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.280
and you were asleep
when I showed up this morning.

01:05:14.479 --> 01:05:15.919
You hungry?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.239
[Ma]: Do you want
some breakfast?

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.439
Yeah, you must be starved.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.280
[Ma]: He's gonna bring you
some breakfast.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.199
Check out what we've got.

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.520
It's pancakes and fruit.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.280
[Ma]: Mm.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.040
Let's check it out.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:37.199
Wow! Pancakes.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.439
[breathing heavily]

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.360
[Ma]: Looks really good.

01:05:40.439 --> 01:05:42.399
Really, really good.

01:05:42.479 --> 01:05:43.840
You want to try it?

01:05:43.919 --> 01:05:45.479
-It goes with syrup, too.
-Everything's looking good.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.840
You want to try syrup?
It's very sweet.

01:05:47.919 --> 01:05:51.479
So...

01:05:51.639 --> 01:05:53.479
I brought you some goodies.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:55.879
Sunglasses.

01:05:55.959 --> 01:05:57.000
Okay.

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:57.959
That'll make you
more comfortable,

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.399
if you need to go outside,

01:05:59.479 --> 01:06:01.399
and, um, sunscreen.

01:06:01.479 --> 01:06:02.600
That's for him, mainly.

01:06:02.679 --> 01:06:04.399
This is important.
That's-that's for Jack.

01:06:04.479 --> 01:06:05.879
Is that really necessary?

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.560
Well, there's a lot of
germs in the air

01:06:08.639 --> 01:06:10.959
that he still needs
to get used to.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.600
And, uh, my colleague

01:06:12.679 --> 01:06:15.040
prescribed this
for your pain,

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.399
for your wrist,

01:06:16.479 --> 01:06:18.159
until they can get you
set up for surgery.

01:06:18.239 --> 01:06:19.679
And that's
to help you sleep.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.919
Just take it
if you need it.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.239
Okay.

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.280
Thank you.

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.520
Come on, Jack.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.320
Let's try some pancake, huh?

01:06:28.439 --> 01:06:29.600
So, have you had a chance

01:06:29.679 --> 01:06:31.120
to think about what we discussed
this morning?

01:06:31.199 --> 01:06:32.760
Yeah, I thought--
I did think about it.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:35.800
Thank you, but...

01:06:35.879 --> 01:06:38.199
I-I really want to go home.

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.560
Okay.

01:06:40.639 --> 01:06:42.600
You know my view.

01:06:42.679 --> 01:06:44.760
Yeah.

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:48.080
And with everything
you two have experienced,

01:06:48.159 --> 01:06:49.159
and, uh,

01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:52.360
just to assess Jack properly.

01:06:52.479 --> 01:06:54.159
But nothing happened to Jack.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.280
No, no, no, I understand.

01:06:55.439 --> 01:06:56.360
I understand.

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.679
He's gonna be
okay, right?

01:07:00.479 --> 01:07:02.760
The most important thing you did

01:07:02.919 --> 01:07:05.639
was get him out
while he's still plastic.

01:07:06.679 --> 01:07:07.840
What?

01:07:07.919 --> 01:07:09.080
[whispers]
I'm not plastic.

01:07:09.159 --> 01:07:10.919
What's that, Jack?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.239
He says that he's--

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.679
he's real.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.600
He's not plastic.

01:07:15.679 --> 01:07:18.000
Well, you got me there, Jack.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.040
You're real.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.520
And you're very brave.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.760
[multiple voices talking
in hallway]

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.320
Um... Yeah, let's talk
about this later.

01:07:25.399 --> 01:07:26.679
Dad?

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.800
Dad!

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.639
I'm sorry. We just couldn't
wait any longer.

01:07:32.719 --> 01:07:33.760
It's okay.

01:07:33.879 --> 01:07:34.919
Don't worry about it.

01:07:39.719 --> 01:07:41.199
[Grandma]: Hello, Jack.

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.719
Thanks for saving
our little girl.

01:07:51.199 --> 01:07:56.520
[Music playing]

01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.719
[Jack]: I've been in the world
37 hours.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.040
I've seen pancakes,

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.959
and a stairs,

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.399
and birds,

01:08:05.479 --> 01:08:06.679
and windows,

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.159
and hundreds of cars,

01:08:08.239 --> 01:08:10.159
and clouds,

01:08:10.239 --> 01:08:10.800
and police,

01:08:10.879 --> 01:08:13.120
and doctors,

01:08:13.199 --> 01:08:14.639
and Grandma and Grandpa.

01:08:14.719 --> 01:08:16.319
But Ma says

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:19.040
they don 't live together
in the hammock house anymore.

01:08:20.799 --> 01:08:23.879
Grandma lives there
with her friend, Leo, now,

01:08:23.959 --> 01:08:26.319
and Grandpa lives far away.

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:27.919
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.799
[Music playing]

01:08:31.879 --> 01:08:35.200
I've seen persons
with different faces

01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:37.200
and bigness and smells,

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.359
talking all together.

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:40.839
[Reporter]: Now, we are getting
unconﬁrmed reports

01:08:40.919 --> 01:08:42.319
that an individual
has just been arrested...

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:43.640
[Jack]:
The world's like

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.439
all TV planets
on at the same time...

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.000
-[phone rings]
-Hello?

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.879
...So I don't know which way
to look and listen.

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:50.799
I just want to come home.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.720
There's doors and more doors,

01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:57.319
and behind all the doors,

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:59.479
there's another inside,

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.640
and another outside,

01:09:01.759 --> 01:09:04.359
and things happen,
happen, happening.

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:06.240
It never stops.

01:09:08.919 --> 01:09:14.240
Plus, the world's always
changing brightness and hotness,

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:19.799
and there's invisible germs
floating everywhere.

01:09:19.879 --> 01:09:23.000
When I was small,
I only knew small things,

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.799
but now I'm ﬁve,
I know everything.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.839
[sirens wailing]

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:34.839
[crowd cheering]

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.399
[Reporter]: Here we are.

01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:40.240
We're outside the Newsome home.

01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:41.240
We're waiting,
and there are two vans...

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:42.279
[crowd cheering]

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:43.319
[Ma]: We're walking out in this?

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:44.919
[Grandma]:
We're getting out here.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.120
Come on, sweetie. It's okay.
Just pick him up.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.080
[Ma]: Come here, Jack.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.919

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.439
[crowd cheering]

01:09:57.959 --> 01:10:01.040
Don't worry about it.
They'll get bored quickly.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.359
-The back of the property...
-Are you okay?

01:10:02.439 --> 01:10:03.560
...ls screened-in really well,

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.640
and we've taken care
where necessary.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:05.879
Okay.

01:10:05.959 --> 01:10:06.759
So if you keep
the front drapes closed...

01:10:06.839 --> 01:10:07.839
You're home now.

01:10:07.919 --> 01:10:09.080
...You'll have
complete privacy.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.399
We'll be outside
if you need anything at all.

01:10:10.479 --> 01:10:12.560
All right. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.160
Your father's still
talking to the lawyer.

01:10:14.279 --> 01:10:15.319
[Ma]: Do you want to take
your shoes off?

01:10:15.479 --> 01:10:16.000
Wow!

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.640
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:18.720
Okay.

01:10:18.799 --> 01:10:20.439
Let's check out downstairs.

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.399
You can do it.

01:10:25.479 --> 01:10:27.120
You want to hold my hand?

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.720
Oh, that's good.

01:10:29.799 --> 01:10:32.000
Come on, one step at a time.

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.439
-Okay, one more. Good.
-Hello.

01:10:37.879 --> 01:10:39.319
-Welcome home, honey.
-Hi.

01:10:39.439 --> 01:10:40.919
I'm very, very happy to see you.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.240
-Hey, Jack.
-You, too.

01:10:43.359 --> 01:10:44.359
This is Leo.

01:10:44.439 --> 01:10:45.839
Hey there, sport.

01:10:45.919 --> 01:10:47.240
[Grandma]: Leo's been our friend
since your mom was little.

01:10:47.319 --> 01:10:49.279
Jack, Jack, come on. Say--

01:10:49.359 --> 01:10:51.200
It's okay. It's okay.
Yeah, it's all right.

01:10:51.279 --> 01:10:53.279
It's all right, sweetie.

01:10:53.359 --> 01:10:54.279
-Let's just--
-Sorry.

01:10:54.359 --> 01:10:55.720
It's okay. Come on in.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.879
[Leo]: So, what can I get you?

01:11:01.959 --> 01:11:03.399
Anyone hungry?

01:11:03.479 --> 01:11:04.600
We have everything.

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.319
[Grandma]:
Yeah, people have been so kind.

01:11:06.399 --> 01:11:09.319
Um, hey, Jack, would you like
something to drink?

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.160
Jack?

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.600
Grandma asked you a question.
Do you want something?

01:11:16.759 --> 01:11:18.319
Are you hungry?

01:11:18.799 --> 01:11:20.279
[whispers] Juice.

01:11:21.759 --> 01:11:22.879
Uh, he would like some juice.
Please.

01:11:22.959 --> 01:11:23.799
-Okay.
-Coming right up.

01:11:23.879 --> 01:11:24.879
Thank you.

01:11:24.959 --> 01:11:26.240
-What about--
-I'm fine.

01:11:26.359 --> 01:11:27.919
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:11:29.959 --> 01:11:31.959
Hey. You know when your Grandma
asks you a question?

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.839
You can answer her.

01:11:34.919 --> 01:11:37.080
You don't need to say everything
to me, okay?

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.560
Just…

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.600
-Ma.?
-What?

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.040
What are those?

01:11:45.959 --> 01:11:47.680
[Ma, whispers]: Those are toys,
some gifts for you,

01:11:47.879 --> 01:11:51.520
from people that are very happy
that we got home safe.

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.799
What people?

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.520
Just people.

01:12:13.479 --> 01:12:15.000
[Grandma]: Do you have
the glasses and the tray?

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:17.560
[Jack]: Where's the ice cream
and the hammock?

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.240
I don't know.

01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:23.439
Work it out later.

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:29.479
What is that?
Let me see that.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.399
Where'd you get this?

01:12:31.479 --> 01:12:32.720
Over there.

01:12:32.799 --> 01:12:34.479
Just in case.

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.520
Do you have a dog?

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:37.879
Oh.

01:12:37.959 --> 01:12:39.600
It's Leo's dog, Seamus.

01:12:41.319 --> 01:12:42.240
He's on furlough
at the moment.

01:12:42.319 --> 01:12:44.479
There's a pal of mine
out of town,

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.799
so living
the country life.

01:12:45.879 --> 01:12:47.240
[Grandma]: You know,
people at the hospital

01:12:47.359 --> 01:12:51.560
said to avoid pets
until your immunity's back up.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:52.759
[door opens]

01:12:52.839 --> 01:12:54.120
[Grandma]: What?

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.240
[Grandpa]: The lawyer said
they're expecting a plea,

01:12:55.319 --> 01:12:56.799
but we can't rule out a trial.

01:12:56.879 --> 01:12:58.640
He wanted to get
into everything.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:12:59.600
I said not today.

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.479
Good.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.520
I made it clear
there'd be no further contact,

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.839
no statements,

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.399
to respect our family.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:11.919
Ah, sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm-

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.040
[Leo]: Can I get you
a drink, Bob?

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.839
Thank you.

01:13:15.919 --> 01:13:17.839
Scotch, if you have--
whatever you have.

01:13:17.919 --> 01:13:19.879
Sure.

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.080
[Grandma]: Well, sweetie,

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.240
is there anything you'd like,

01:13:25.319 --> 01:13:28.720
or like to do, or...

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.759
[Ma]: You got it.
You got it.

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.000
Go on.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.640
Yeah.

01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:57.959
This is your mom's
room, Jack.

01:14:00.399 --> 01:14:01.839
Hey.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:03.959
Uh, maybe tomorrow,

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.120
we can cut that hair.

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.560
What do you say, Jack?

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.759
Ma?

01:14:09.839 --> 01:14:12.000
What? What?

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.959
[whispers]
It's where my strong is...

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.520
That's true.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.359
He says
that's where his strong is.

01:14:18.439 --> 01:14:20.399
Oh. Yeah.

01:14:24.319 --> 01:14:26.600
Um...

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:27.879
Maybe I'll just
let you rest, huh,

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.799
and we'll--
we'll see you downstairs.

01:14:29.919 --> 01:14:31.200
We'll be downstairs, okay?

01:14:31.279 --> 01:14:32.200
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.439
[Grandpa]:
Mm. It's really good, Nancy.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.160
[Ma]: Want to try some?

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.839
No?

01:14:43.919 --> 01:14:45.439
It's apples.
You like apples.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.000
[Grandma]:
How about some ice cream?

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.959
Here you go.

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:51.000
What do you say?

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.439
[whispers] Thank you.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.479
[Ma]: I know you can say it
louder than that.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.640
[slightly louder whisper]
Thank you.

01:14:55.799 --> 01:14:58.479
-It's okay.
-Thank you for being polite.

01:15:01.959 --> 01:15:04.240
-Leo?
-It’s good.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.200
[whispers] Ice cream hurts.

01:15:21.279 --> 01:15:23.720
[Leo]: You've got a brain freeze
there, Jack.

01:15:23.799 --> 01:15:26.359
[Ma]: You've just
got to eat slower. Okay?

01:15:40.319 --> 01:15:42.200
I think I'll turn in.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.959
Is there something wrong?

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.399
Mm-mm. No.

01:15:49.479 --> 01:15:51.040
Why are you in such a hurry?

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:54.879
Been a big day.

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.359
You haven't said
one word to Jack.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.959
Joy. Joy.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.399
Um...

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.680
We're not going
to have to talk about this now?

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.919
[Ma]: Yes, we do, Dad.

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.560
Look at him.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.160
Dad.

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:27.640
Robert.

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:29.560
[Ma]: Please.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.600
Dad.

01:16:34.959 --> 01:16:36.479
I'm--I'm sorry.

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:38.399
I'm sorry. I can't.

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:39.520
-We're out of here.
-Robert.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.640
[Grandma]: Joy. Joy.

01:16:40.759 --> 01:16:42.080
[Ma]: Put your spoon down.
Let's go.

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.160
-Hey.
-We're going to bed.

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.040
[Grandma]:
No, Joy, don't-- Joy!

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:45.439
Robert.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.319
[whispers]
Where's Grandpa?

01:17:14.399 --> 01:17:17.000
He had to go home for a while.

01:17:22.919 --> 01:17:25.160
You want to play
with some of those toys?

01:17:41.399 --> 01:17:42.720
Do you know who that is?

01:17:42.799 --> 01:17:43.839
This?

01:17:43.919 --> 01:17:45.279
That's you.

01:17:45.359 --> 01:17:47.160
Yeah, that's me.

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.600
And Stacey Benton

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:51.919
and Heather Noel

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.680
and Laura Sullivan.

01:17:55.759 --> 01:17:58.959
We were on a relay team.

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.959
I was the anchor.

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:04.399
I was really fast.

01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:06.160
We did track.

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.080
-Real track?
-Mm-hmm.

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.120
On a field.

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:19.799
You know what happened to them?

01:18:19.879 --> 01:18:23.240
-No.
-Exactly.

01:18:23.359 --> 01:18:24.720
Nothing.

01:18:24.799 --> 01:18:27.120
Just lived their life
and nothing happened.

01:18:47.359 --> 01:18:51.759
[Music playing]

01:18:57.359 --> 01:18:59.160
[Officer]:
Nothing new at this point.

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.000
Just a family reunited.

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:01.919
[Female Reporter]:
How is Jack doing?

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.399
How is the family doing?

01:19:05.319 --> 01:19:07.680
Jack, get away from the window.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.959
Jack?

01:19:10.879 --> 01:19:12.040
Wonderful.

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.600
So, the other thing
that we need to discuss

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.560
is some sort of media strategy.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:20.439
[Grandma]: God, we're not ready
for talking like that, not yet,

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:21.439
so…

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.319
Okay, um...

01:19:23.399 --> 01:19:26.160
There's gonna be
expenses moving forward

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:27.759
and a "Prime Time" interview,

01:19:27.839 --> 01:19:29.439
just one
"Prime Time" interview,

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.959
means a lot of money.

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.600
[Jack]: Ma, how long
are we going to be here for?

01:19:52.439 --> 01:19:54.359
[Ma]: This is
where we live now, Jack.

01:19:58.279 --> 01:20:03.479
[Music playing]

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.479
[Leo]: ...As much information
as I can give you.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.120
I'm sure Nancy knows more.

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.319
I'll get her to call you
when she gets in.

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.160
-Thanks.
-Thanks again.

01:21:08.279 --> 01:21:11.799
Okay, so...

01:21:11.879 --> 01:21:14.680
What am I gonna do now?

01:21:14.759 --> 01:21:18.040
I wonder if there's
anybody around that would...

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:21.439
play with me or talk to me.

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:25.000
I guess not.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.160
I'm pretty hungry.

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.359
Oh, I know.

01:21:29.439 --> 01:21:31.520
I got something
in the kitchen, I think.

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:35.040
Oh, yes,
I've got something very...

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:37.680
tasty in the kitchen, I think.

01:21:38.479 --> 01:21:40.359
Let me see what's here.

01:21:44.319 --> 01:21:45.799
[humming]

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.399
Hello.

01:21:51.479 --> 01:21:53.439
I didn't know you were up.

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.520
[humming]

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.560
Pretty good, hmm?
Am I right?

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.839
I like this kind, too.

01:22:12.919 --> 01:22:14.120
Kind of sweet,

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.319
but they're pretty good.

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.839
Do you really have a dog?

01:22:25.919 --> 01:22:28.680
I do.

01:22:28.759 --> 01:22:29.680
Named Seamus.

01:22:31.439 --> 01:22:32.359
He's very small.

01:22:32.439 --> 01:22:37.200
He's not very smart.

01:22:37.279 --> 01:22:40.279
You should meet him sometime.

01:22:40.439 --> 01:22:42.319
He'll shake your hand.

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.799
I had a dog once named Lucky.

01:22:48.919 --> 01:22:49.919
-Mm?
-But he wasn't real.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.879
Yeah?

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.240
He lived in Room.

01:22:54.319 --> 01:22:56.479
Hmm.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.319
[Dr. Mittal]: So we've got
some fluffy clouds in the sky.

01:23:03.399 --> 01:23:06.759
Mm-hmm.

01:23:06.839 --> 01:23:08.720
It looks like a nice day.

01:23:08.799 --> 01:23:11.000
Which one of these
guys is you?

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.200
-That guy?
-Mm-hmm.

01:23:15.359 --> 01:23:17.560
And who's this?

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.240
What is that?

01:23:19.319 --> 01:23:21.399
It's a whale.

01:23:21.479 --> 01:23:23.520
This guy
sees blood under the eyes,

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:24.759
so he wants to go diving...

01:23:24.839 --> 01:23:25.799
I'm sorry.

01:23:25.879 --> 01:23:27.080
...to help too.

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.839
No, it's okay.

01:23:28.959 --> 01:23:30.279
No, don't worry about it.

01:23:30.359 --> 01:23:31.319
Let her rest.

01:23:31.399 --> 01:23:32.240
I'm almost done here.

01:23:32.319 --> 01:23:33.799
Okay.

01:23:33.919 --> 01:23:35.359
Well, I'm really
looking forward

01:23:35.439 --> 01:23:36.720
to seeing how
this masterpiece turns out.

01:23:36.839 --> 01:23:39.080
Don't worry about it.

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.200
[Grandma]: I just--

01:23:40.279 --> 01:23:41.359
I just couldn't
get her to come down.

01:23:41.439 --> 01:23:42.560
[Dr. Mittal]:
Don't worry about it.

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:44.319
It's perfectly normal.

01:23:44.399 --> 01:23:46.399
Yes, I understand.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.879
It's gonna take time
for her to heal.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.040
-She's been home, what, 10 days?
-Mm-hmm.

[Dora the Explorer]:
I need your help!

01:24:12.759 --> 01:24:14.279
Will you check my backpack

01:24:14.359 --> 01:24:17.520
for something we can use
to ﬁx the wheel?

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:20.120
The same backpack has vanished--

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:22.319

please?

-[Dora]: Great!
-Jack!

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.600
Come here.

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:35.959
Look! You have all these toys.

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.439
I don't want to.

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.680
Any kid would be so happy
to have these, and you--

01:24:39.759 --> 01:24:40.799
you barely even touched them.

with something real.

being on the phone.

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.839
Well, I don't give him my phone,

01:25:21.919 --> 01:25:23.000

if you didn't give him yours.

Okay, I won't.

to connect with something.

That is not
what the doctor said.

You don't know
what he said,

01:25:58.799 --> 01:25:59.879
because it was
a confidential conversation,

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.399
I have asked you.

01:26:13.479 --> 01:26:14.799
And then what?

01:26:14.879 --> 01:26:16.759
Then, every time you look at me,
that's all that you see?

01:26:16.839 --> 01:26:20.120
When I look at you, Joy,
I will see my daughter.

01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:23.520
You don't need me.

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.359
You've been doing just fine
without me.

01:26:25.439 --> 01:26:27.439
Oh.

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.000
How can you say that, huh?

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:31.439
Do you think that

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:34.600
you were the only one
whose life was destroyed?

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.160
Actually, that's
exactly what I think.

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:37.120
Yeah? How would you feel

01:26:37.279 --> 01:26:38.120
if somebody took
Jack away from you?

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:39.080
Oh, shut up!

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.160
Go easy.

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.879
[Grandma]:
Look at him!

01:26:41.959 --> 01:26:44.080
You should be thinking
about him!

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:47.160
[Ma]: Oh, don't you tell me
how to look after my son.

01:26:47.279 --> 01:26:49.000
I'm sorry
that I'm not nice anymore,

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.439
but you know what?

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:53.640
Maybe if your voice saying
"Be nice"

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:55.080
hadn't been in my head,

01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.720
then maybe
I wouldn't have helped the guy

01:26:56.799 --> 01:26:58.399
with the fucking sick dog!

01:27:02.879 --> 01:27:04.319
Stay there, Jack.

01:27:06.319 --> 01:27:07.919
[Ma]: I'm calling
the fucking lawyer.

01:27:09.839 --> 01:27:11.720
I can't stay in this place.

01:27:25.439 --> 01:27:27.600
Isabel, so, what are thinking
for the walk and talk?

01:27:29.439 --> 01:27:32.759
And I want you to know that
you guide this interview, okay?

01:27:32.839 --> 01:27:34.520
So, what you feel
comfortable with,

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:35.520
you talk about it,

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:36.600
and when you don't,

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.240
you just say,
"not comfortable,''

01:27:38.319 --> 01:27:39.640
and we move on
to another question.

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:40.720
Okay.

01:27:40.799 --> 01:27:41.919
And I'm gonna...
you know?

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.040
My lawyer said--
said that it's nice...

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:44.479
You're good.

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.359
Thanks.

01:27:46.439 --> 01:27:47.839
[A.D.]: And speed.

01:27:49.799 --> 01:27:52.200
Did you ever think
you would see this house again?

01:27:52.279 --> 01:27:54.359
-I hoped.
-You hoped?

01:27:54.439 --> 01:27:55.799
[Ma]: Yes.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.799
[interview continuing]

01:28:02.879 --> 01:28:04.120
It's time
to go downstairs, Jack.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.919
Remember what your mom said?

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.919
[Ma]: ...So many silly things.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.560
Jokes with friends and...

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:14.000
Sure, absolutely.

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:23.759
-It can get hot, can't it?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah. The lights.

01:28:23.839 --> 01:28:25.600
The lights, they get very warm.

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:27.040
Just let me get this
out of the way.

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:29.640
[Sports Reporter]:
…Two touchdowns were decisive

01:28:29.759 --> 01:28:31.399
in that game against Michigan

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:33.759
and would've won in overtime
a couple of weeks ago.

01:28:35.919 --> 01:28:38.279
...But I think they got
a false start...

01:28:38.359 --> 01:28:40.040
Listening to you,

01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:44.160
I'm sure you must have felt
at times as if...

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:47.279
God had deserted you.

01:28:47.399 --> 01:28:49.399
In those
very black moments...

01:28:49.479 --> 01:28:51.240
Yeah.

01:28:51.319 --> 01:28:53.879
...did you consider
taking your own life,

01:28:53.959 --> 01:28:55.319
just to escape?

01:28:55.399 --> 01:28:56.240
[Lawyer]: I'm getting
the feeling my client's very--

01:28:56.319 --> 01:28:57.319
It's okay. I'm okay.

01:28:57.399 --> 01:28:58.759
-Can you give her a minute?
-Sure.

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:02.399
I'm fine.
Can I just have a tissue?

01:29:02.479 --> 01:29:04.080
Of course. Can we get
her a tissue, please?

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.680
-Here you go.
-Hard to talk about.

01:29:06.759 --> 01:29:09.240
-I'm sure.
-Sorry.

01:29:09.319 --> 01:29:10.959
[Reporter]:
You don't have to apologize.

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.839
Nobody's expecting you to be,

01:29:12.919 --> 01:29:15.040
you know,
the pillar of strength.

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.720
You can cry.

01:29:16.799 --> 01:29:19.399
You know, why don't we just
go on to the next question?

01:29:19.479 --> 01:29:21.439
Would that be okay?

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:26.479
Do you want to put your tissue
maybe under your chair?

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.439
Oh, yeah.

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:29.680
There you go, huh?

01:29:29.759 --> 01:29:32.640
There's snot in my nose.

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.359
-Let's see? Good.
-Okay.

01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:38.240
So...

01:29:38.319 --> 01:29:41.160
when Jack came along,

01:29:41.319 --> 01:29:42.520
was it different for you then?

01:29:42.759 --> 01:29:44.080
Um, when Jack came,

01:29:44.319 --> 01:29:47.959
everything was different.

01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:52.799
He was so beautiful, and...

01:29:52.959 --> 01:29:56.479
I just knew that
I had to keep him safe.

01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:59.040
Of course.

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:00.520
Of course.

01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:05.240
When he's older,

01:30:05.399 --> 01:30:08.000
will you tell Jack
about his father?

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.200
Jack's not his.

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:13.080
He's not his--

01:30:13.279 --> 01:30:15.640
So are you saying that
there were other men?

01:30:15.879 --> 01:30:17.359
No!

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.319
No.

01:30:19.399 --> 01:30:20.359
Um...

01:30:20.439 --> 01:30:23.399
a father is...

01:30:23.479 --> 01:30:25.000
a man who loves his child.

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:26.000
Of course.

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:27.080
That's so true

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:31.000
in a very real sense, but the...

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.919
...the biological relationship
that you--

01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:34.879
That's not a relationship.

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:40.640
Jack is--
is nobody's but mine.

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.839
When he was born, did it--

01:30:50.919 --> 01:30:52.839
did it ever occur to you

01:30:52.919 --> 01:30:54.200
to ask your captor

01:30:54.399 --> 01:30:56.680
to take Jack away?

01:30:57.319 --> 01:30:58.560
Away?

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:00.959
[Reporter]:
Well, to take him to a hospital,

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.720
say, leave him there,
where he could found?

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:09.279
Why-- why would I do that?

01:31:09.359 --> 01:31:12.000
So Jack could be free.

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.720
Now, this is
the ultimate sacrifice--

01:31:14.839 --> 01:31:17.120
and I understand that--

01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:20.919
but did you think about him
having a normal childhood?

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.600
But he had me.

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:26.399
Of course he did.

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:30.160
But was that
the best thing for him?

01:32:29.759 --> 01:32:31.759

-What? What is it?

01:33:03.919 --> 01:33:05.959
-Ma!
-Jack!

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.120

[Music playing]

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:50.040
[Jack]: There's so much
of place in the world.

01:35:54.439 --> 01:35:55.799
There's less time,

01:35:55.959 --> 01:35:57.399
because the time
has to be spread extra thin

01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:58.919
over all the places,

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.680
like butter.

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:06.879
So all the persons say,

01:36:06.959 --> 01:36:10.399
"Hurry up. Let's get going.
Pick up the pace.

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:13.000

You're really good at that.

I did it before,

01:38:04.839 --> 01:38:06.799
Hmm, you did? Wow.

01:38:09.479 --> 01:38:11.040
What else did you do there?

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:12.080
Lots of stuff.

Sometimes, I miss it.

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:18.959

Mm-mm.

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:33.879
Yeah.

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:47.160
When Old Nick came.

01:38:48.759 --> 01:38:51.680
I want to see Ma.

01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:52.640
Yeah, I know.

01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:55.080
She's, um...

01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:58.839
she just needs to be on her own
for a little while.

01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:01.319
[door opens]

01:39:01.399 --> 01:39:02.439
[Leo]: Jack?

01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:04.160
Someone here
would like to meet you.

01:39:05.279 --> 01:39:08.200
Jack. Here, let me
get this for you.

01:39:08.279 --> 01:39:10.240
Come on.
Let's go see.

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.399
Jack…

01:39:21.479 --> 01:39:22.799
meet Seamus.

01:39:22.879 --> 01:39:25.720
Would you like to pet him?

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:39.799
Yeah.

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:51.919
[Leo]:
There he goes, shaking again.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:52.959
It makes him feel good.

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.200
[Jacky
Makes him... feel good?

01:39:54.279 --> 01:39:55.319
[Leo]:
Yeah, makes him feel good.

01:39:55.399 --> 01:39:56.200
You should try that.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Well, he's moving.

01:40:20.919 --> 01:40:25.279
[Music playing]

01:40:38.919 --> 01:40:43.359
[Music playing]

01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:49.879
Grandma?

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.040
Yes.

01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:52.399
I need the scissors.

01:40:52.479 --> 01:40:53.680
What for?

01:40:53.759 --> 01:40:55.120
For cutting my hair.

01:40:57.919 --> 01:40:59.439
Do you really want to do that?

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.439
I want to send it to Ma.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:03.759
How come?

01:41:03.839 --> 01:41:05.359
She needs my strong
more than me,

01:41:05.439 --> 01:41:06.759
so I want to send it to her,

01:41:06.919 --> 01:41:08.359
or you could take it to her?

01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:13.319
I could help you, if you'd like?

01:41:13.439 --> 01:41:14.680
Yes, please.

01:41:14.759 --> 01:41:17.720
Okay. Okay.

01:41:17.799 --> 01:41:20.439
Let's do this right.

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:21.959
I have been wanting
to cut that hair...

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:24.319
for a very long time.

01:41:24.399 --> 01:41:26.279
Come on.

01:41:26.359 --> 01:41:28.000
I used to cut
your mother's hair all the time,

01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:30.720
and your Grandpa's.

01:41:30.799 --> 01:41:31.759
I hope I've still got it.

01:41:31.839 --> 01:41:33.560
Do you think this will work?

01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:36.959
Can my strong
be her strong, too?

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:39.560
Oh. Of course it can.

01:41:41.399 --> 01:41:44.240
We all help each other
stay strong.

01:41:44.319 --> 01:41:45.279
No one is strong alone.

01:41:45.359 --> 01:41:47.799
You know, you and your mom,

01:41:47.879 --> 01:41:49.720
you help each other through,
don't you?

01:41:49.799 --> 01:41:52.120
-Yep.
-Mm-hmm.

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.640
And you and me,
you and Leo,

01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.560
Leo and me.

01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:58.279
We all have the same strong.

01:41:58.399 --> 01:42:00.319
-I guess we do.
-Okay.

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:03.120
All righty.

01:42:06.439 --> 01:42:08.040
Are you ready?

01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:11.720
Steady...

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.439
Here. See?

01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:28.359
See?

01:42:29.959 --> 01:42:31.160
What do you think?

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:35.200
Wow!

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.240
Ooh! Oh, yeah.

01:42:42.959 --> 01:42:44.959
You can't get
soap in my eye.

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:46.160
No, there's a towel right there
if you need it.

01:42:46.279 --> 01:42:47.560
Here we go.

01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:50.399
-And my mouth.
-Your mouth, too.

01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:54.600
This is the best part. Oh!

01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:57.000
-Mm.
-Doesn't it feel good?

01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:01.319
-Yeah.
-Oh, good.

01:43:01.399 --> 01:43:02.560
Oh, let's see.

01:43:09.479 --> 01:43:10.959
There.

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:17.000
I love you, Grandma.

01:43:21.279 --> 01:43:23.160
I love you, too, Jack.

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:41.439
[banging]

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.560
[Jack]: Keeps on happening.

01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:12.279
[Ma knocks on the window]

01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:52.600
I'm sorry, Jack.

01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:56.959
It's okay.

01:44:58.359 --> 01:44:59.799
Don't do it again.

01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:03.399
I promise.

01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:08.200
Are you better now?

01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:12.799
Yeah, I'm starting to be.

01:45:29.439 --> 01:45:30.399
Hey, Jack.

01:45:30.479 --> 01:45:31.359
Yeah?

01:45:38.279 --> 01:45:40.160
When Grandma
brought this to me...

01:45:43.479 --> 01:45:45.319
I knew that I could get better.

01:45:49.399 --> 01:45:51.600
You saved me...

01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:52.640
again.

01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:56.120
Can I...

01:45:57.959 --> 01:46:01.040
No.

01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:03.720
There's no more left, sorry.

01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:10.319
Okay.

01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:19.600
I'm not a good enough Ma.

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:22.879
But you're Ma.

01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:32.359
l am.

01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:37.879
l am.

01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:44.680
I'm going to play with Aran now.

01:46:44.799 --> 01:46:46.520
He's my friend.

01:46:52.919 --> 01:46:53.839
Okay.

01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.479
[Jack]:
When I was four,

01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:04.799
I didn't even know
about the world,

01:47:04.879 --> 01:47:06.720
and now me and Ma
are going to live in it

01:47:06.799 --> 01:47:10.200
forever and ever
until we're dead.

01:47:16.919 --> 01:47:17.879
This is a street

01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:19.000
in a city

01:47:19.319 --> 01:47:21.319
in a country called America,

01:47:21.399 --> 01:47:22.879
and Earth,

01:47:22.959 --> 01:47:26.200
that's a blue and green planet,
always spinning,

01:47:26.279 --> 01:47:28.959
so I don't know
why we don't fall off.

01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:31.319
Then, there's Outer Space.

01:47:31.439 --> 01:47:34.919
And nobody knows
where's heaven.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.680
[all screaming, playing along]

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.000
[Ma]: Pull yourself out!

01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:43.279
[Music playing]

01:47:43.359 --> 01:47:45.200
Ma and I have decided

01:47:45.279 --> 01:47:47.080
that because we don't know
what we like,

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.000
we get to try everything.

01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:57.640
There are so many things
out here.

01:47:57.759 --> 01:48:00.120
And sometimes, it's scary,

01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:02.919
but that's okay,

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.600
because it's still
just you and me.

01:48:12.879 --> 01:48:16.600
Can we go back to Room?

01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:18.879
Jack…

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:20.879
Just for a visit.

01:48:28.319 --> 01:48:30.560
Watch your step.

01:49:37.279 --> 01:49:39.799
Is this Room?

01:49:39.879 --> 01:49:40.799
Yeah.

01:49:43.439 --> 01:49:45.120
Has it gotten shrinked?

01:49:46.359 --> 01:49:47.919
Where is everything?

01:49:48.399 --> 01:49:51.560
Taken for evidence.

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:54.799
Proof that we were here.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.839
It's because Door's open.

01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:28.520
What?

01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:32.359
It can't really be Room
if Door's open.

01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:36.640
Do you want me to close it?

01:50:38.799 --> 01:50:41.160
Nah.

01:50:46.359 --> 01:50:47.919
Jack, can we go?

01:50:53.919 --> 01:50:57.759
Bye, Plant.

01:50:57.839 --> 01:51:00.319
Bye, Chair number one.

01:51:00.439 --> 01:51:03.520
Bye, Chair number two.

01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:04.520
Bye, Table.

01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:09.799
Bye, wardrobe.

01:51:12.879 --> 01:51:15.040
Bye, sink.

01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:23.200
Bye-bye, Skylight.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.120
Ma, say bye-bye to Room.
