00:19.603 --> 00:23.566
Hi. I'm Steven Weber.
And I play the murderer...

00:23.649 --> 00:24.858
Thanks, Lyle.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.653
...in this <i>Handsome</i> mystery movie.

00:28.070 --> 00:31.740
Enjoy this exciting multiplatform event.

01:47.858 --> 01:50.611
<i>Tonight, "A Lil' Dab'll Do Ya."</i>

01:52.279 --> 01:57.242
As a detective, there's no greater skill
that you can hone than your intuition.

01:58.243 --> 02:01.246
I mean, if you can't trust your gut,

02:01.872 --> 02:04.332
you might as well be
in parking enforcement.

02:04.416 --> 02:07.920
-Yeah, I mean, go be a meter maid.
-A meter man.

02:08.586 --> 02:12.049
Very good, Detective Rice. Very good.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.551
You're looking at everything
from all angles.

02:14.635 --> 02:18.138
All right, let's take a look
at the board, shall we?

02:18.221 --> 02:21.516
What do you see?
What does your gut tell you?

02:21.599 --> 02:23.101
I'm looking at the boner.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.438
That man's dick is hard.

02:26.521 --> 02:29.399
I think
it's the classic Margaritaville theory.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.567
The theory that states

02:30.651 --> 02:34.363
if a middle-aged man has too much
laid-back fun, he ceases to exist.

02:34.947 --> 02:37.157
Yeah. Anyone else got a theory?

02:37.240 --> 02:38.951
Detective Burt Jerpis.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.787
I know, Detective Jerpis. I hired you.

02:41.870 --> 02:45.290
We see this guy here, sure.
But is that the whole story?

02:45.373 --> 02:46.792
How do we know
that this guy doesn't work

02:46.875 --> 02:49.502
at a rental car agency
at the airport, all right?

02:49.586 --> 02:52.297
And it's his boss' last day.
Maybe that guy's name is Roger.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.841
Roger loves to golf.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.259
So he and all of his coworkers
dress up like Roger.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.054
Golfers. And you wanna know
what Roger always wanted to do?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.348
Skydivings. So they all get in the car,

03:01.431 --> 03:04.184
they go over to the airstrip
and they get in the skydivings plane.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.561
They get up to 20,000 feet
and they get into an argument.

03:06.644 --> 03:07.730
Maybe it's about a girl,

03:07.813 --> 03:10.315
maybe it's about who had the right recipe
for the veggie chili.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.192
We don't know the answer to that yet.

03:12.275 --> 03:15.153
But then argument breaks out
and this guy gets strangled.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.947
He gets thrown out
of that skydivings plane.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.324
Guess where he lands, of all places?

03:19.407 --> 03:22.160
-Golf course. Case closed.
-You know what?

03:22.244 --> 03:23.829
Let's not trust our guts.

03:23.912 --> 03:27.415
I'm sorry. That's not the boner
of a man still livin'.

03:27.499 --> 03:30.085
Handsome! We need to talk now.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.921
Yes, Lieutenant.

03:33.881 --> 03:34.882
Yes.

03:34.965 --> 03:37.175
You didn't fill out
your retirement papers.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.387
-You pulled me out here for that?
-I thought you should know.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.765
Of course I know.
I'm the one who didn't fill 'em out.

03:42.848 --> 03:45.433
Don't try to complicate things
with your sweet talk.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.310
Sweet talk?

03:47.394 --> 03:50.438
You poor, innocent kid.
You just don't get it, do you?

03:52.024 --> 03:53.358
No.

03:55.193 --> 03:58.321
-What were we talking about?
-I have no idea.

03:58.405 --> 04:02.450
Believe me, I'll remember.
And when I do, you'll know, missy.

04:02.534 --> 04:03.535
Connie!

04:14.546 --> 04:16.882
I just remembered what it was.

04:16.964 --> 04:19.802
We have so many leftovers
from Waikiki Wednesday,

04:19.885 --> 04:21.678
I think you should take these home.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.848
No, no, no, I'm good.
I'm trying to watch my weight--

04:24.932 --> 04:26.474
Oh, no, you don't understand.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.811
-They've got thick frosting...
-Yeah.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.897
-...smeared just the way you like it.
-Yeah.

04:31.980 --> 04:35.483
And they're shaped like beach balls
that just bounce right into your mouth,

04:35.567 --> 04:39.237
bounce right into your belly
and bounce right outta your butt. Hmm?

04:40.072 --> 04:42.866
I'm, uh... There's no way I'm taking
these, uh, home with me.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.326
Hmm? Hmm?

05:17.442 --> 05:20.153
Hello, Candy. Hello.

05:23.740 --> 05:27.535
These are not mine.
That's all I'm saying. Don't ask.

05:40.132 --> 05:43.176
Yeah. Every day's a tough one.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.386
Every day's a tough one,

05:44.469 --> 05:46.513
but it's so much better
when I come home to you.

05:46.596 --> 05:50.433
I love you. I love you so much.
You're so pretty.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.687
Do me a favor. See those cookies?

05:55.939 --> 05:56.982
Don't let me eat 'em.

05:57.900 --> 06:02.779
You hear me? If I go near those cookies,
you knock my ass over, all right?

06:02.862 --> 06:05.908
'Cause you're capable of doing that,
you big fucker.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.540
Yeah, let's go for a walk.

06:16.126 --> 06:19.087
Hey, Handsome,
don't pretend I'm not here.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.172
Durante.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.967
Stop letting your dog shit on my lawn.

06:26.178 --> 06:29.306
-Not hers. Don't recognize it.
-Of course it's hers.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.392
It looks like her,
curled up as a piece of shit.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.935
Okay, look at her.

06:34.436 --> 06:37.272
She's not even looking at it.
She knows it's not hers.

06:37.355 --> 06:40.442
There's no caginess about her.
No recognition whatsoever.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.361
-She's just playing it cool.
-Look into her eyes.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.738
They're pools of pure tranquility.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.574
You think you can read a perp
better than me?

06:47.657 --> 06:50.785
You've lost it. You know that, right?
Happens to the best of us.

06:50.868 --> 06:53.121
You used to investigate real crime.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.999
Now you're chasing around
cheating husbands,

06:56.083 --> 06:58.961
hanging outside of crappy motels
in Venice.

06:59.044 --> 07:01.046
You know what makes this country great?

07:01.129 --> 07:03.465
It's not that everybody's
cheating on their spouses,

07:03.548 --> 07:04.799
because they're not.

07:04.882 --> 07:09.012
It's that everyone unconsciously
feels cheated.

07:09.096 --> 07:13.808
That's right. By the government,
by their bosses, by Whole Foods.

07:13.891 --> 07:17.895
And then they transfer that suspicion
onto their loved one.

07:17.980 --> 07:22.859
And it's that very feeling
that keeps me in such great business.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.946
I'm thinking of buying a Ferrari.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.991
Well, I just put 50 bucks
into my IRA account.

07:29.074 --> 07:32.702
And in lieu of getting a Tesla,
I'm gonna retire soon-ish.

07:32.785 --> 07:37.832
-That job really wears on a person.
-It does. It really does.

07:37.916 --> 07:42.087
-Hey, uh, you got new neighbors.
-On the other side? When?

07:42.670 --> 07:45.590
Are you not paying attention?
A couple of weeks ago.

07:45.674 --> 07:48.885
Renters.
Looks like a single mom and her kid.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.846
-Maybe the kid took the dump.
-I just saw nervous fidgeting.

07:51.929 --> 07:55.058
That was nervous fidgeting.
That's definitely nervous fidgeting.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.061
Of course Candy's fidgeting.
You know where I found her?

07:58.145 --> 08:01.731
I found her abandoned
in a foreclosed house in Burbank.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.234
<i>Buona sera,</i> Handsome.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.987
Ah... <i>Buona sera,</i> Esta.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.906
Hmm. Why are we wishing each other
good evening?

08:10.407 --> 08:14.327
It is just... an okay <i>sera.</i> Just okay.

08:14.411 --> 08:17.289
Well, it just started.
It could get a lot better.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.791
Mmm. I don't think so.

08:30.177 --> 08:34.097
I still don't know what she sees in you.
I'm guessing she likes to be depressed.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.100
I could say the same thing about your dog.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.062
Yeah. We're gonna go back on our walk.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.442
I get it.
Your dog has had a tragic history.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.070
But don't let her shit on my lawn.

08:49.321 --> 08:50.822
Go.

09:39.036 --> 09:43.291
-Can I help you?
-Hi. I'm your neighbor, Gene Handsome.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.627
I thought I'd come and welcome you
to the neighborhood

09:45.710 --> 09:48.463
by, uh, bringing you and your daughter
some cookies.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.299
-I'm the babysitter.
-Oh! Okay, well, then,

09:51.383 --> 09:54.636
-you can take the cookies.
-I'm not opening this door.

09:56.304 --> 09:59.391
I commend your cautiousness.
You seem like an A-plus sitter.

09:59.474 --> 10:05.480
But, as I said, I live next door.
I am an officer of the law.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.899
So you really got nothin' to worry about.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.859
I'm sorry.
I'm not comfortable opening the door.

10:10.485 --> 10:13.113
You think I'm a creep.

10:13.196 --> 10:16.324
Oh, my God, that's the last thing
I wanna be, is a creep.

10:16.408 --> 10:20.745
No, no, no, that's not my intention.
That's not who I am.

10:20.828 --> 10:24.166
I mean, you can go put them on the porch,
but I can't say anyone's gonna eat them.

10:27.001 --> 10:31.172
I'm gonna leave them right over here,
but you gotta do me a favor.

10:32.089 --> 10:35.260
After I go, please bring in the cookies.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.595
'Cause later tonight,
I don't wanna see them out here,

10:37.679 --> 10:41.057
'cause I'm afraid
I'll come over and, uh, eat one.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.894
-Wow.
-I know. I got a problem, I...

10:44.977 --> 10:48.773
All right, anyhow, take them in.
Thank you very much. I'll see you later.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.106
Handsome.

11:31.858 --> 11:32.984
Yeah.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.529
All right, pick me up.

11:46.498 --> 11:49.751
I gotta go. I gotta go.

11:51.043 --> 11:54.213
I'll see you later. Make me get up.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.259
<i>- You know what I watched the other night?</i>
<i>- Huh?</i>

11:57.342 --> 12:01.930
Best movie I've ever seen.
I don't know if you saw it. <i>San Andreas.</i>

12:02.013 --> 12:03.473
I love <i>San Andreas.</i>
You fuckin' kidding me?

12:03.556 --> 12:06.393
Oh, my God. The Rock? Perfection.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.562
The absurdity?
Best absurdity I've ever seen.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.689
Maybe one of the best movies...
Easily the best...

12:11.773 --> 12:15.234
What won the Oscar in 2015
that was better than <i>San Andreas?</i>

12:15.318 --> 12:18.655
Best movie ever.
And all the time he spent in a boat.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.533
He's in a boat,
but he's a helicopter pilot. I loved it.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.200
-I loved it.
-I loved it.

12:23.285 --> 12:27.414
What would you do if you had a partner
who didn't like how loud you talk?

12:27.497 --> 12:29.291
I don't talk loud. You talk loud.

12:29.374 --> 12:32.460
I don't know who talks louder between us,
you or I.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.045
We both talk very loud...

12:34.128 --> 12:37.382
...and I don't know
which one is the louder talker.

12:43.305 --> 12:44.597
Good morning, everybody.

12:44.681 --> 12:47.266
-Everybody's looking sharp.
-What do we got goin' here?

12:49.769 --> 12:52.522
-Holy shit.
-What the fuck is this?

12:58.486 --> 13:00.947
I can't believe it. No way.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.659
Fleur... I think I know this girl.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.202
-You do?
-Yeah.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.079
That's my neighbor's sitter.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.040
I tried giving her cookies yesterday.

13:11.541 --> 13:14.586
-What do you mean, "tried"?
-I tried. She wouldn't take them.

13:14.669 --> 13:17.964
She's a very cautious young lady.
She wouldn't even open the door.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.675
-She knows the person who did this.
-Absolutely.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.012
All right, has anyone else noticed this?

13:24.929 --> 13:28.725
But it looks like her body's put
into the shape of the Star of David.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.560
- Oh, man.
- Jesus.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.646
Jesus.

13:35.732 --> 13:36.899
Jesus.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.068
Sir, can I quit the force forever, please?

13:40.069 --> 13:41.904
-You wanna quit the force?
-Yeah.

13:41.988 --> 13:42.989
Why?

13:43.072 --> 13:44.491
'Cause we're all sitting here casually,

13:44.574 --> 13:47.535
talking about this chopped up woman
in this yard, and it's disgusting.

13:48.536 --> 13:53.416
We're not casually talking about the lady.
We're trying to figure out who did this.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.085
-Sir, I have a theory.
-You do? What do you got?

13:56.168 --> 13:57.504
Suicide.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.839
-That's it?
-That's it.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.469
-I deduce that that's stupid.
-Hey, easy. We're all trying here.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.388
Sorry, Detective Burt Jerpis, sir.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.473
I know, Jerpis. Go ahead.
What do you got?

14:08.556 --> 14:10.266
This is a drive-by, plain and simple.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.935
- How do you get that?
- I'll show you, sir.

14:13.019 --> 14:17.482
Our victim was out for a walk.
A leisurely, late night walk.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.400
Along comes our perp,

14:19.484 --> 14:21.569
driving a late '90s Honda Accord,
purple...

14:21.653 --> 14:22.945
That's my gut feeling.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.532
Then this punk...
and that's what he is,

14:25.615 --> 14:28.743
takes out a gun, shoots our victim.
What's on the gun?

14:28.826 --> 14:32.830
A silencer. Why is there a silencer?
To keep things quiet.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.708
Then, to cover his tracks...

14:37.126 --> 14:41.088
he chops the body up into these pieces

14:41.172 --> 14:43.508
and arranges them
into this religious symbol.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.387
- Case closed.
- No, not case closed.

14:47.470 --> 14:50.556
We don't have a bullet wound,
and we don't have a killer.

14:51.891 --> 14:52.892
Oh...

14:55.770 --> 14:59.691
-That's why you're the boss.
-All right, who's the king of the castle?

14:59.774 --> 15:01.984
The house belongs to Talbert Bacorn.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.904
- The actor?
- Yeah, yeah. I'd bend him over.

15:05.988 --> 15:06.989
Uh, and then what?

15:07.073 --> 15:10.159
What do you mean? I'd just bend him over.
Eat a little popcorn out his ass.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.412
-Okay, I'll do the interview with Bacorn.
-Mmm-hmm.

15:12.495 --> 15:16.248
-Okay. What about me?
-You take care of that.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.374
Ah.

15:17.459 --> 15:20.753
Guys, on the right is the home
of Talbert Bacorn,

15:20.837 --> 15:22.755
the star of <i>Rainbow Squad.</i>

15:27.427 --> 15:29.429
- Do what you gotta do.
- Done.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.015
I'm... I'm freaking out!

15:33.099 --> 15:36.603
Of course you're freaking out.
There's a crime scene in your front yard.

15:36.686 --> 15:40.857
Okay. Do you think
someone is... is threatening me?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.358
Do you think they're trying
to send me a message?

15:42.442 --> 15:43.568
What do you think that message is?

15:43.651 --> 15:47.071
-Do you think PETA is trying to ambush me?
-PETA?

15:47.155 --> 15:50.783
I wore suede pants
at my première.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.036
Well, I don't think
that's really their style.

15:54.370 --> 15:57.665
Why don't you just sit down and breathe?

15:58.791 --> 16:00.001
Do breathing exercises?

16:00.084 --> 16:04.756
No, not formally.
Just sit down, kick back, breathe.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.932
All right, let's go. Keep it moving.
There's nothing to see here.

16:15.016 --> 16:18.019
They want to know if that's
a decapitated body on Mr. Talbert's lawn.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.479
No.

16:19.562 --> 16:23.399
She thinks we're stupid
because we don't speak English.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.651
Why would she assume
we don't speak English?

16:24.734 --> 16:28.530
Because we're a bus full of tourists
from Japan who don't speak English.

16:28.613 --> 16:34.285
Is the body arranged carefully
in the shape of a Star of David?

16:34.368 --> 16:37.413
Is the body carefully
arranged in the shape of a Star of David?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.165
Unequivocally no.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.792
What's a Star of David?

16:40.875 --> 16:42.502
It's a symbol for Judaism.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.047
Rabbi?

16:46.964 --> 16:50.677
The Magen David is said to symbolize
the shape of King David's shield,

16:50.760 --> 16:54.806
but there is really no support for that
claim in any early rabbinic literature.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.098
In my opinion.

17:00.102 --> 17:03.940
Tell me about last night.
What did you see? What happened?

17:04.022 --> 17:07.609
You may have saw or heard something
that you're not even aware of.

17:07.693 --> 17:12.114
Ah, so true.
An actor's senses are so finely attuned.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.324
Like a detective's.

17:13.406 --> 17:14.659
Mmm...

17:14.742 --> 17:16.868
Probably a little better
than a detective's,

17:16.953 --> 17:21.582
but a little worse than a blind man
whose fingertips are so sensitive,

17:22.375 --> 17:24.502
he can make words out of bumps.

17:25.336 --> 17:26.588
Back to last night...

17:27.503 --> 17:29.632
-What went on?
-Last night, last night...

17:29.716 --> 17:33.052
Well... I pet sit
for my next-door neighbor,

17:33.135 --> 17:35.054
so I went next door and fed the dog.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.806
-You pet sit?
-I do.

17:37.849 --> 17:40.184
Are you close with the neighbor?
You love dogs?

17:40.267 --> 17:44.063
I seize any opportunity
to add to my actor's toolbox.

17:44.146 --> 17:48.943
Should I have the opportunity to play
a pet sitter in some future project,

17:50.152 --> 17:51.487
I know how they'll feel.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.365
That's a real dedication to your craft.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.951
It's my life.

17:58.410 --> 18:02.373
When you were over there, did you see
anybody walkin' around, coming, going?

18:02.456 --> 18:06.377
No, nothing. It was all quiet.
Not a creature was stirring on my lawn.

18:07.169 --> 18:10.256
Well, I really don't think
the victim would've been stirring.

18:11.257 --> 18:15.386
So you come back from your neighbor's.
You're home. What next?

18:15.469 --> 18:19.015
Well... I got undressed for bed,
and I watched my movie!

18:19.098 --> 18:23.770
Yes, it was on cable.
It's an old movie of mine from 1985.

18:23.853 --> 18:28.440
<i>Patty-Cake.</i> I played Emil,
the baker man's illegitimate son.

18:28.524 --> 18:31.193
- I think I remember that one.
- Mmm.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.238
It's an early work, but underrated.

18:34.322 --> 18:40.536
The scene where I'm crying and chanting,
"Patty-cake, patty-cake."

18:41.203 --> 18:43.873
I hold up my little hands
for my father to clap them,

18:43.956 --> 18:45.041
and he rejects me.

18:46.042 --> 18:48.002
Still holds up.

18:48.085 --> 18:51.255
So, you're watching the movie.
Did you hear anything?

18:52.757 --> 18:54.591
Mmm...

18:54.676 --> 18:55.677
No.

18:56.678 --> 18:57.762
Okay.

18:59.096 --> 19:04.476
Uh, if you think of anything else,
please give me a call.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.562
Do not text me. I don't enjoy it.

19:06.646 --> 19:10.149
So you'll send me a special police detail
for my protection?

19:10.232 --> 19:11.859
We're gonna keep an eye on things.
Don't worry.

19:11.943 --> 19:15.196
Oh, thank you.
I'm used to a lot of attention.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.999
You do know it's the ex-boyfriend,
don't you?

19:27.834 --> 19:30.336
-Lieutenant Kenda.
-Detective Handsome.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.422
Do not worry.
I've got all the angles covered.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.216
It's always the ex-boyfriend.

19:35.299 --> 19:39.303
It's the old, "If I can't have you,
no one will have you."

19:39.386 --> 19:43.515
-You see chopped up bodies a lot?
-Not a lot, but I've seen them.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.017
You know what that says?

19:45.685 --> 19:49.480
"To kill you is not enough.
I want to punish you."

19:50.189 --> 19:52.066
Very personal. Very close.

19:53.442 --> 19:56.570
-Have you been stretching like I said?
-Occasionally.

19:56.653 --> 20:00.700
You need to do it more than occasionally.
Limbers you up.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.238
Hey!

20:39.321 --> 20:42.950
Oh, shit.
Sorry, I thought you were my sitter.

20:43.034 --> 20:44.243
Yeah, about that...

20:44.326 --> 20:48.080
I'm, uh, Gene Handsome,
detective with the LAPD

20:48.164 --> 20:50.541
and, coincidentally,
your next door neighbor.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.045
-Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

20:54.128 --> 20:57.214
-Oh, shit. Did Heather get arrested?
-Why would you say that?

20:57.298 --> 21:01.177
Sticky fingers. Yeah, she's stolen
a few of my going-out tops,

21:01.260 --> 21:03.637
but it's really hard
to find a good sitter.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.682
Well, I've got some bad news.

21:07.892 --> 21:13.773
This is so brutal.
And then to get chopped up like that?

21:13.856 --> 21:16.859
-Yeah. It's tough.
-Oh, my God. Poor Heather.

21:16.943 --> 21:21.572
It's terrible. And, uh,
what was your relationship with her?

21:21.655 --> 21:24.408
Was she close to you guys?
Was she like family?

21:25.742 --> 21:27.286
She... Eh...

21:27.369 --> 21:31.498
She... she was the babysitter.
But, you know, nice.

21:31.582 --> 21:32.750
She was fine.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.127
-Oh, hey, honey.
-Hi there.

21:35.211 --> 21:39.548
Uh, this is my daughter, Carys.
Carys, this is Detective Handsome.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.176
Did you overhear everything that happened?

21:42.259 --> 21:43.302
Mmm-hmm.

21:43.385 --> 21:46.263
The angels came
and took Miss Heather to hell.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.350
Hmm.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.436
I don't know
where she gets that stuff.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.272
-Kids.
-Oh, shit!

21:55.356 --> 21:57.984
I'm so late for work
and I'm out of sick days.

21:58.067 --> 22:01.028
-What time do you work till?
-One o'clock. Fridays are my half-day.

22:01.863 --> 22:02.864
I'll watch her.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.824
-Wait, are you serious?
-I'm totally serious.

22:04.907 --> 22:07.493
I've got some questions to ask you.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.871
Uh, we can get back to that
as soon as you come back.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.788
-Great. Thank you so much.
-Yeah. Sure.

22:11.873 --> 22:13.665
-That's great. You're fine.
-Yeah. Yeah.

22:13.749 --> 22:19.255
You're great. Yeah. Okay. Good? Okay.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.676
How about that?

22:24.760 --> 22:29.223
Who wouldn't want a real detective
as their babysitter?

22:33.895 --> 22:36.522
Guess you. You're the one who doesn't.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.068
I'm really good at dancing.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.279
You're gonna love the show
that I have planned for you.

22:43.362 --> 22:47.199
Very exciting. I love the arts.
I'm a patron.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.868
Of the arts.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.621
-Take a seat on the couch.
-All right.

Hi.

24:01.983 --> 24:04.110
-How's Carys?
-A delight.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.071
-Really?
-She's a great kid. Yes.

24:07.154 --> 24:10.199
-Oh, good. Great.
-Yeah.

24:10.282 --> 24:14.996
-Is, uh, now a good time?
-Yeah. Sure. Uh-huh.

24:15.079 --> 24:18.582
-All right. How was your day?
-Ugh, it was disgusting.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.334
I hate teeth.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.004
I am so sick
of looking into people's mouths.

24:23.087 --> 24:24.796
I have this recurring nightmare where

24:24.880 --> 24:28.342
instead of all of my teeth falling out,
I get more of them.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.761
Just, like, more and more and more.

24:30.844 --> 24:34.015
I get teeth fingernails
and teeth toenails.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.975
My belly button even sprouts a tooth.
It's disgusting.

24:37.059 --> 24:39.603
Have you thought of getting out
of the dental industry?

24:39.687 --> 24:43.357
Yeah. Teeth are vile.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.860
You know, both of our jobs,
we see the worst of people.

24:47.778 --> 24:49.071
That's so true.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.948
- Heather, your babysitter.
- Yeah.

24:52.033 --> 24:54.618
Did she have any romantic interests?

24:54.701 --> 24:58.372
Oh... Um, not that I'm aware of.

24:58.455 --> 25:03.752
You know, she did mention an ex-boyfriend,
but he's back east and he's married now.

25:03.836 --> 25:08.298
-I didn't get the sense that they talk.
-Okay, do you have any info on him?

25:08.841 --> 25:11.593
Uh, no, just that he's married.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.179
-That's it.
-Okay.

25:13.262 --> 25:16.140
Um, was anybody giving her any trouble?

25:16.223 --> 25:20.352
Did she, um, uh, have any issues
she was dealing with?

25:21.895 --> 25:27.068
Well, I... I mentioned the, like,
klepto shenanigans.

25:27.151 --> 25:28.569
-Mmm-hmm.
-Um...

25:28.652 --> 25:31.197
Well, I know she had
a hard time paying bills,

25:31.280 --> 25:33.115
-but that's pretty standard, right?
-Mmm-hmm.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.117
I mean... so do I.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.035
You know,
the rent on this place is ridiculous,

25:37.119 --> 25:39.538
but we have to have a yard, so...

25:41.165 --> 25:46.295
You know what? She did actually tell me
that sometimes when she would go out,

25:46.378 --> 25:51.217
she would get into these, like, bar fights
with other girls when she got drunk.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.301
About what?

25:52.384 --> 25:56.764
Well, one time, I know it was because
she made fun of a girl's highlights.

25:57.556 --> 26:03.145
Apparently, Heather told her she looked
like a bale of hay from Temecula.

26:03.812 --> 26:07.233
-That's a very specific insult.
-That is why it stuck with me.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.610
Mmm. Did she live alone?

26:10.152 --> 26:13.030
Oh, no, there's a roommate, Amanda.
Here, give me your pad.

26:14.448 --> 26:19.370
Uh, Amanda would probably know more of,
like, the personal crap about Heather.

26:19.453 --> 26:22.956
Most of the time, we just talked about
what she gave Carys for dinner.

26:24.208 --> 26:27.628
-That's the address.
-You don't dot your I's.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.005
Who needs 'em?

26:31.340 --> 26:34.092
-Heather lived here in the living room?
-Yeah.

26:34.176 --> 26:35.719
This is all of her shit.

26:36.928 --> 26:39.931
Um, listen, I have a guy
from Tinder jogging over,

26:40.015 --> 26:41.808
so is there any way
you could come back later?

26:42.684 --> 26:43.685
Forgive me,

26:43.769 --> 26:47.481
but for someone whose roommate just died,
you don't seem very upset.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.107
Oh, no, I'm really sad.

26:49.191 --> 26:50.901
But also, I want this place
to just go back

26:50.984 --> 26:55.197
to being a normal one-bedroom,
because this is a really awkward setup.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.907
You two didn't get along?

26:56.990 --> 26:59.576
No, I mean, she was fine.
Like, if you had your period

26:59.660 --> 27:04.623
and were lying down and complaining...
But, like, she could also be really rude.

27:04.706 --> 27:06.708
What, like making fun of your highlights?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.878
I haven't had highlights since 2014, so...

27:09.961 --> 27:11.755
I'm not keeping track. It's all good.

27:11.838 --> 27:14.883
-What is this used for?
-I don't know.

27:14.966 --> 27:19.305
Uh... She was actually, like,
a very problematic roommate.

27:19.388 --> 27:21.807
Like, I have my childhood
gymnastics trophies.

27:21.890 --> 27:24.393
I keep them on my headboard.
She thought that was dumb.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.604
So then when I went to the bathroom,
she called me Mary Lou Rectum.

27:27.688 --> 27:31.525
Oh, and then one time, she told me
to tell my tits they could come out

27:31.608 --> 27:34.027
now that my gymnastics career was over.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.573
-She date anybody?
-Heather likes old dudes.

27:38.199 --> 27:41.577
There was one guy she was meeting up with.
I think he was in his forties.

27:41.660 --> 27:45.289
Old dude. Yeah,
what do you know about him?

27:45.372 --> 27:48.334
Nothing. Uh, he didn't stay over.
He didn't spend the night.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.711
I do not think he wanted
to be seen in public with her.

27:50.794 --> 27:53.714
-Why's that?
-Well, that's usually really good sex.

27:53.797 --> 27:57.009
When someone hates themself
for stooping to fuck you, you know?

27:57.593 --> 28:00.179
No, uh, uh, I don't. I have no idea.

28:00.554 --> 28:04.891
- Also he bought her a lot of finery.
- Finery? What's finery?

28:04.975 --> 28:07.186
You know, luxury clothing
for a modern woman.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.021
Oh.

28:09.730 --> 28:13.317
"Silky Lamb."
Is that like a lotion version of finery?

28:13.567 --> 28:14.651
No, I just told you.

28:14.735 --> 28:17.571
Finery is luxury clothing
for a modern woman.

28:17.654 --> 28:20.073
Listen, my booty call's
about to be here any second,

28:20.156 --> 28:23.577
and he's my favorite match on Tinder,
so I can't have you fucking this up.

28:23.660 --> 28:28.540
-Okay, thank you for being so patient.
-You're welcome. Goodbye!

28:29.791 --> 28:34.170
Lester! Welcome back, my friend.
How was your vacation?

28:34.255 --> 28:38.759
Had a mind to stay in Tahiti longer,
but all these bodies thought different.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.177
Pretty gruesome. What do you think?

28:41.262 --> 28:45.015
Well, something very interesting's
going on. Come on over here.

28:47.351 --> 28:50.396
-You see this sheen coming off her skin?
-I do.

28:50.479 --> 28:53.148
Can you discern that
this woman is unusually greasy?

28:53.607 --> 28:57.110
-She is.
-She is very well creamed.

28:57.193 --> 29:01.114
-This here's a very well-creamed body.
-She seems unusually greasy.

29:01.197 --> 29:03.074
-You don't see this often.
-That makes sense.

29:03.158 --> 29:07.579
I was just at her apartment.
She had an extremely nice jar of lotion.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.873
Are you sure that jar you saw
said "lotion"?

29:09.956 --> 29:11.958
When I see the word "lotion,"
I don't forget.

29:12.042 --> 29:15.629
No, no, no, no, no.
This here's not lotion. This here's cream.

29:15.712 --> 29:18.089
-Well, what's the difference?
-You don't know?

29:18.173 --> 29:20.926
-I don't know.
-Well, lotion's water-based.

29:21.009 --> 29:25.472
You apply it liberally all over your body.
But cream is oil-based.

29:25.556 --> 29:28.517
You got to be careful with cream.
Lil' dab'll do ya.

29:30.226 --> 29:32.354
Um, I'm sorry,
I didn't get that.

29:32.438 --> 29:33.605
Can you repeat that for me?

29:33.689 --> 29:35.399
Okay, listen carefully.

29:35.482 --> 29:38.694
Lotion is water-based.
Use as much of that as you want.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.612
Don't matter. It's water-based.

29:40.696 --> 29:44.616
But cream, that's oil-based.
You hear me? Oil-based.

29:44.700 --> 29:48.078
-Lil' dab'll do ya.
-Okay, so lotion, I go crazy.

29:48.161 --> 29:49.913
-Yeah.
-Do what I want. All over.

29:49.996 --> 29:53.542
-Now what's the story with cream again?
-Lil' dab'll do ya.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.586
Thank you. Thank you.

29:55.669 --> 29:59.255
Anyway, she was killed
via blunt force to the head.

29:59.340 --> 30:01.967
You see this globe-shaped dent
here on her skull?

30:02.050 --> 30:05.637
-Yeah.
-Well, weapon was about yea big.

30:06.262 --> 30:10.141
-Well, what about the dismemberment?
-Well, that was all postmortem.

30:10.225 --> 30:15.439
But what's most notable about the job is,
whoever did it was very, very sloppy.

30:15.522 --> 30:19.025
Just jabbing here and there
till the limb come off.

30:19.109 --> 30:21.695
Jabbing. Lil' jab'll do ya.

30:22.446 --> 30:25.657
- Get the fuck on out of here.
- Okay.

30:28.410 --> 30:29.620
Cell phone records, bam.

30:29.703 --> 30:32.205
Okay, so, uh, most of these calls
are to be expected, right?

30:32.288 --> 30:34.666
We got the job, roommate, parents,
pot dealer, pussy waxer.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.793
But then there's a number that repeats.

30:36.877 --> 30:39.380
Traces to an office landline registered
to an executive.

30:39.463 --> 30:42.298
Lloyd Vanderwheel. He's in fireworks.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.094
- Well--
- Handsome!

30:46.177 --> 30:49.014
- Oh, shit.
- We need to talk now!

30:49.097 --> 30:50.349
Mmm.

30:57.731 --> 31:01.192
-Meet you in the car?
-Yeah. See you there.

31:03.404 --> 31:07.741
So, how'd you like the cookies?

31:08.909 --> 31:11.578
Um...
They were great. Amazing.

31:11.661 --> 31:13.246
-Ah, really?
-Yeah.

31:14.205 --> 31:17.376
Because truth be told,
they weren't leftovers.

31:17.459 --> 31:21.463
I made that batch just for you.

31:25.175 --> 31:31.264
I just want you to know that I'm here.
At the station. At your house.

31:31.347 --> 31:34.560
Not my house. I have a family visiting
from Caracas. They're very nice.

31:34.643 --> 31:39.940
I just don't know how they feel
about the sound of gentle lovemaking.

31:40.023 --> 31:44.570
Or raunchy lovemaking.
Whatever. Just sounds in general.

31:44.653 --> 31:46.530
Why did I come here to see you?
That's right.

31:46.613 --> 31:51.159
The retirement papers. Sign 'em, Handsome.
You're not fooling anybody.

31:51.242 --> 31:54.245
And by the way, my tubes are tied.

32:00.961 --> 32:02.295
You gotta fix this door.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.591
Yeah, I will.

32:17.478 --> 32:20.564
It's a booming, sparkling morning.
Can I help you?

32:20.647 --> 32:24.526
Yes. Detectives Handsome and Scozzari
of the LAPD.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.237
Uh, we're here
to see one Mr. Lloyd Vanderwheel.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.198
One moment, please. Mr. Vander...

32:30.281 --> 32:32.618
Oh, shoot. My finger slipped.

32:32.701 --> 32:35.370
- Mr. Vander... Oh, shoot.
<i>- Uh, yes, Sky. What's going on?</i>

32:35.454 --> 32:37.956
I'm sorry.
I got excited

32:38.039 --> 32:41.417
and I pushed the button too soon,
Mr. Vanderwheel.

32:41.502 --> 32:45.756
<i>-Sky, don't push the button.</i>
-Oh, God! Go ahead. No, I...

32:45.839 --> 32:47.466
<i>Sky? Sky?</i>

32:47.549 --> 32:50.176
Hey, uh, forget about the intercom.

32:52.262 --> 32:54.931
These detectives are here to see you.

32:55.849 --> 32:58.309
So, uh, what's this all about?

32:58.393 --> 33:00.854
- Do the thing.
- Yeah.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.651
Mmm-hmm.

33:06.359 --> 33:07.360
What...

33:07.443 --> 33:08.987
What was that for?

33:09.070 --> 33:11.907
Oh. Oh, this? Don't worry about it.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.742
You look great in this shot.

33:13.825 --> 33:17.662
Ah, then again, bet you've never taken
a shitty photo in your life, huh?

33:17.954 --> 33:19.247
Is this about...

33:19.330 --> 33:21.833
...the Lancaster Jazz
and Heritage Festival?

33:21.917 --> 33:23.627
Did we go too big? Uh...

33:24.127 --> 33:27.088
I just got caught up with, uh...

33:27.673 --> 33:30.258
So clearly, you're familiar
with Heather Dromgoole.

33:31.635 --> 33:33.803
-Heather?
-You were seeing her romantically?

33:34.387 --> 33:39.392
No. No, no, no, no, no. She's...
she's an old family friend from back east.

33:40.644 --> 33:42.812
The kid of my parents' friends.

33:43.730 --> 33:48.234
Uh, she moved out here recently
and, um, I was helping her get set up.

33:48.318 --> 33:49.528
Oh.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.237
So you guys aren't a thing?

33:52.238 --> 33:54.324
- No, I'm... I'm single.
- Oh.

33:55.325 --> 33:58.537
-So you're single?
-Yeah. I'm single.

33:58.620 --> 34:00.288
-He's single.
-I was asking!

34:00.371 --> 34:02.999
Okay, she'd be calling you regularly for?

34:03.083 --> 34:06.461
Just to get advice. Check in.

34:07.379 --> 34:10.674
She got real lonely in LA, as one does.

34:12.007 --> 34:14.719
I think she looked to me
like a bit of a father figure.

34:14.803 --> 34:18.681
-Oh, yeah, Daddy?
-Yeah. That's right.

34:20.266 --> 34:23.603
So why you asking all these questions
about Heather? Did she get arrested?

34:23.687 --> 34:25.021
Why would you say that?

34:25.105 --> 34:27.440
Uh, maybe blackmail.

34:28.399 --> 34:31.652
I know she had a...
a bit of a blackmail incident

34:31.737 --> 34:33.279
with her high school English teacher.

34:33.362 --> 34:36.699
You know, I had a, uh, black male incident

34:36.783 --> 34:41.121
with my sexy-ass
black high school English teacher, too.

34:42.746 --> 34:46.042
Heather was the victim of a murder
on Thursday night.

34:46.668 --> 34:48.587
Oh, my God! Uh...

34:49.545 --> 34:51.089
I'm sorry.

34:51.172 --> 34:55.677
What? I... This...
I can't believe this. Wow.

34:56.469 --> 34:57.721
I mean...

34:58.930 --> 35:02.768
I can't believe this,
but I can believe this.

35:02.851 --> 35:04.269
-Excuse me?
-Huh?

35:04.352 --> 35:08.440
You know, some people, you can't
imagine anyone wanting to murder.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.358
But Heather?

35:13.945 --> 35:14.946
You know?

35:16.489 --> 35:18.325
But still, it's devastating.

35:19.159 --> 35:21.536
Jesus. God. Jesus.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.497
Any ideas of who would be upset with her?

35:25.206 --> 35:28.126
Uh, no. No one comes to mind.

35:28.918 --> 35:30.253
Wow.

35:30.336 --> 35:31.630
<i>Mr. Vander...</i>

35:31.713 --> 35:33.089
Oh.

35:33.173 --> 35:36.885
I'm... I'm sorry.
My one o'clock is here.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.638
Um, but, hey, let me give you my card.

35:39.721 --> 35:45.143
And, uh, you guys can give me a call
if you have any, uh, more questions.

35:45.226 --> 35:48.813
-Who's that?
-Oh, that's, uh... It's my kid, Carys.

35:49.648 --> 35:52.984
She's the biggest sweetheart.
Anyway, here.

35:53.484 --> 35:57.948
Yeah, just give me a call, uh, if you have
any names you wanna run by me

35:58.031 --> 36:03.453
and I'll help however I can.
I... aim to please.

36:06.289 --> 36:08.166
Oh, give me a fuckin' break.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.626
I'm not buying
the whole father-figure thing.

36:10.711 --> 36:14.464
-Thank you very much.
-Sure. Have an explosive day.

36:14.547 --> 36:17.175
I mean, who calls
their fake dad that much?

36:17.258 --> 36:19.052
Yeah, yeah, it's very suspicious.

36:19.135 --> 36:20.553
You know, I just, uh...

36:20.636 --> 36:23.807
I realized I gotta go
to the bathroom, like, bad.

36:24.474 --> 36:26.559
- It's okay, I'll wait.
- No, you know what?

36:26.642 --> 36:28.687
Could take a while,
so why don't you just go ahead,

36:28.770 --> 36:30.731
and, uh, I'll take a cab
back to the station.

36:30.814 --> 36:32.733
That's okay.
It's gonna be that long of a trip?

36:35.151 --> 36:36.611
Yeah, uh...

36:36.695 --> 36:40.741
-Okay, I'll just sit and meditate.
-Nah. Nah, nah, nah. You know, you go on.

36:40.824 --> 36:42.117
I mean, like the lady said,

36:42.200 --> 36:43.952
it's gonna be an explosive day, right?

36:44.035 --> 36:47.663
-Interesting.
-What? What?

36:52.002 --> 36:55.213
-Hi there.
-Why are you talking to me?

36:55.296 --> 36:58.925
Ooh, the detective.
Just busy detecting, aren't you?

36:59.425 --> 37:01.845
I'm Charles, Carys' friend.

37:01.928 --> 37:04.139
We met while making fun
of the mailman's calves.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.391
Hi, Charles, nice to meet you.

37:06.474 --> 37:10.686
Carys, could you tell your mother
that Detective Handsome's here to see her?

37:10.771 --> 37:15.608
Oh, we're off to check out a four-bed,
three-bath open house. So...

37:16.526 --> 37:18.236
Oh, hi, Gene. Come on in.

37:18.987 --> 37:21.448
Hi, um, I was driving home from work,

37:21.531 --> 37:23.742
and I thought of something I wanted
to ask you.

37:24.784 --> 37:28.204
-Are you hungry? Do you want some pasta?
-No, I'm good. I'm good.

37:29.039 --> 37:31.917
Were you aware
that your ex-husband knew Heather?

37:33.960 --> 37:37.881
-What? Lloyd was fucking Heather?
-Well, he says that he wasn't.

37:37.964 --> 37:40.675
Oh! You know what?
I bet he got off on the fact

37:40.759 --> 37:43.804
-that he was fucking my babysitter.
-So you definitely didn't know?

37:43.887 --> 37:46.056
He would fuck my gardener
just to rattle me,

37:46.139 --> 37:48.141
'cause that's just
the kind of guy that he is.

37:49.350 --> 37:51.853
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, hey, neighbor.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.604
Hey.

37:53.688 --> 37:59.360
Aroma of the forest floor.
Full-bodied. Jammy finish.

37:59.444 --> 38:02.488
-That's what's in store for you tonight.
-Wow, thank you.

38:02.572 --> 38:05.533
-"Wow" is right.
-You two know each other? Yeah?

38:06.201 --> 38:08.536
- Devon.
- Uh...

38:08.619 --> 38:11.998
Yeah, we do. Handsome here has broken up
quite a few of my house parties.

38:12.082 --> 38:15.668
I affectionately like to call him
Detective Buzzkill.

38:15.751 --> 38:18.880
I wouldn't call four strippers playing
with your dreidel collection

38:18.964 --> 38:20.006
a house party.

38:22.050 --> 38:27.597
Sounds fun. Devon and I met when I was
watering the flowers in this very window.

38:27.680 --> 38:31.977
Mmm-hmm. And I was staring
into her house over the fence.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.312
-And then he waved at me.
-Oh...

38:34.395 --> 38:35.605
- I'm a waver.
- Mmm-hmm.

38:35.688 --> 38:38.399
Then we locked eyes
and there's a moment where we were like,

38:38.483 --> 38:42.111
"We should probably have dinner together."
And we're about to do that.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.406
Cool, cool.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.169
Oh, Esta.

39:00.171 --> 39:03.716
Put that accordion on my abs.

39:18.899 --> 39:22.568
And, uh... a, uh, double cheeseburger.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.905
Okay, and would you like to
make that a meal?

39:24.988 --> 39:27.866
You know what? Give me
the single cheeseburger on its own

39:27.949 --> 39:30.076
and make
the double cheeseburger a meal. Yes.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.828
Okay, and what beverage
would you like with your meal?

39:34.789 --> 39:35.915
You know what? Fuck it.

39:35.999 --> 39:37.667
- Chocolate milkshake.
- Okay.

39:42.463 --> 39:47.468
I'm sorry, I know you guys
are church kids. Excuse the salty talk.

39:47.552 --> 39:49.595
It's okay. Satan gets all of us sometimes.

39:49.679 --> 39:54.100
Yeah. You know, tonight's the last night
I'm gonna eat this crap.

39:54.184 --> 39:58.063
I mean, no offense to Norm's Burger.
I don't mean that your food's crap.

39:58.146 --> 40:00.481
It's just...
It's not good for a guy like me.

40:01.191 --> 40:03.568
Yep, this is it.
Gonna start fresh tomorrow.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.528
I think that's great.
You can be your best self.

40:05.611 --> 40:07.405
I can be my best self!

40:07.488 --> 40:08.698
-Very kind of you.
-Yeah.

40:14.955 --> 40:17.290
Weren't you just out back there
with the other guy?

40:17.373 --> 40:19.459
Oh, the headset's broken, so...

40:19.542 --> 40:23.213
Yeah. Sort of like old-fashioned service.

40:23.296 --> 40:25.590
-Uh, yeah, a bit like that.
-Okay.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.217
Uh, $9.57's your total.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.593
I was ready.

40:29.928 --> 40:33.431
Thirty-two, please.
Number 32, your order is ready.

41:01.626 --> 41:05.171
Okay, so this is her debit.
I flagged some interesting purchases.

41:05.255 --> 41:08.674
Uh, okay, you tell me, who the fuck spends
900 bucks in one pop at Hallmark?

41:08.758 --> 41:10.176
Hey? Come on.

41:10.260 --> 41:11.886
I mean, otherwise, it seems kosher.

41:11.970 --> 41:15.390
Uh, this one is
her Victoria's Secret Angel Card.

41:15.473 --> 41:19.602
I mean, the girl could not resist a "buy
five panties, get the sixth free" event.

41:19.685 --> 41:21.687
And, uh, here's her PayPal.

41:22.981 --> 41:26.401
I found something
which I think will intrigue you.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.653
Okay? What's that?

41:29.988 --> 41:33.074
-Did you sign off on this?
-Yeah. Why?

41:37.620 --> 41:38.829
What the fuck?

41:38.913 --> 41:42.125
-When did she start wearing ties to work?
-I don't know. Oh!

41:42.875 --> 41:47.797
She's getting regular deposits
from MrFFF@aol.com.

41:47.880 --> 41:51.176
Fireworks, Fireworks, Fireworks, huh?

41:51.259 --> 41:55.722
He's putting $500 a week into her account.
What's he paying her for?

41:56.097 --> 41:58.433
I guess it must be out of the goodness
of his heart, right?

42:00.226 --> 42:02.937
Where's the, uh, cell phone records?

42:03.021 --> 42:07.983
And they're underneath, uh, this.
And I've got them.

42:08.068 --> 42:10.986
And okay. How about this?

42:11.071 --> 42:15.450
Heather, Mondays at 7:30 p.m.,
is calling Lloyd.

42:15.533 --> 42:20.371
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
also calling Lloyd.

42:20.455 --> 42:24.417
Same time. Fridays...
You ready for this?

42:24.667 --> 42:28.421
1:30 p.m., she calls Lloyd.
Take a guess why.

42:28.504 --> 42:30.673
-Chits and chats at Chuckie's?
-Yes!

42:30.756 --> 42:32.717
-Yeah.
-Yes! That sounds like fun.

42:32.800 --> 42:37.222
Friday is the day
that Heather gets off work early.

42:37.305 --> 42:40.015
Nora works until 1:00.

42:40.100 --> 42:42.477
She comes home.
She says goodbye to Heather.

42:42.560 --> 42:47.398
Heather goes out.
Who does she call? Mr. FFF.

42:47.482 --> 42:50.485
That's right.
I think she's reporting to him.

42:52.570 --> 42:56.699
Well, Mr. Vanderwheel,
looks like we're having a reunion.

42:56.782 --> 42:59.494
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

43:02.037 --> 43:03.914
Don't play coy with me!

43:03.998 --> 43:07.001
I know I'm looking at two people
who did the hokeypokey yesterday.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.878
- What?
- Bingo.

43:08.961 --> 43:14.217
Okay, you were giving money to Heather
to spy on your ex-wife.

43:15.135 --> 43:16.136
Uh...

43:17.052 --> 43:18.304
What?

43:18.387 --> 43:19.388
I see you.

43:20.098 --> 43:22.600
Oh, I see you clearly.

43:23.184 --> 43:27.063
And let's not waste this moment
of beautiful transparency

43:27.147 --> 43:32.485
by watching you throw
a pile of stinky bullshit at my face.

43:32.568 --> 43:33.486
Okay!

43:33.736 --> 43:37.532
Okay, I planted Heather
in Nora's home to get dirt on her.

43:38.283 --> 43:40.326
We're in the midst of a custody battle.

43:40.410 --> 43:43.288
And Heather would tell me things
Nora would forget to do,

43:43.371 --> 43:45.123
like get Carys her flu shot.

43:45.206 --> 43:48.793
She told me the crap
that Nora was feeding my kid.

43:48.876 --> 43:50.836
She told me what would stress Nora out.

43:50.920 --> 43:53.631
Besides me and my lawyer.

43:53.714 --> 43:55.883
Okay.
Look, I'm gonna ask you a few questions,

43:55.966 --> 44:00.846
and, uh, Handsome over here's gonna know
if you're telling the truth or not.

44:02.056 --> 44:03.266
Uh...

44:03.349 --> 44:06.144
Did Heather turn on you
and threaten to give you up to your wife?

44:06.227 --> 44:07.061
No.

44:08.688 --> 44:13.526
No. Uh, was Heather blackmailing you
for even more money?

44:13.609 --> 44:14.610
No.

44:14.694 --> 44:16.404
Did you like that move I did yesterday

44:16.487 --> 44:19.740
where I made your dick bend
all the way to the right?

44:19.824 --> 44:22.034
I loved it.

44:26.497 --> 44:29.709
- Bye! Have an explosive day.
- Thank you.

44:30.418 --> 44:31.752
You can go in now.

44:33.254 --> 44:34.880
-Talking to me?
-Yeah.

44:37.091 --> 44:39.093
Appreciate it.

44:51.772 --> 44:56.902
Hey, Sky, is that the, uh, book
of all your company's work?

44:56.986 --> 44:58.321
Mmm-hmm. Sure is.

44:58.404 --> 45:01.532
Wow, those are beautiful fireworks.

45:01.616 --> 45:02.867
- Oh, yeah.
- Really.

45:02.950 --> 45:04.368
Very impactful.

45:05.703 --> 45:07.788
Could I borrow that book
for a couple of days?

45:09.749 --> 45:13.461
Well, this is the coffee table book.

45:13.544 --> 45:16.088
Well, you've already taken it
off the coffee table.

45:16.171 --> 45:19.425
Yeah, you have a point.
But it'll go back over there soon.

45:21.636 --> 45:24.972
If you remove it,
then what would I put on the coffee table?

45:25.055 --> 45:27.267
-You don't have a second book?
-No.

45:27.350 --> 45:29.852
We get a monthly fireworks magazine,

45:29.935 --> 45:32.397
but it's not nice for putting out.

45:32.480 --> 45:34.607
You could consider this an opportunity.

45:34.690 --> 45:37.234
-An opportunity?
-Yeah.

45:37.318 --> 45:38.903
To get a second book.

45:39.487 --> 45:43.824
You could get a book
on fireworks, plants, carpentry.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.826
Whatever you want. You're in charge.

45:54.502 --> 45:55.836
It's time.

46:01.842 --> 46:03.177
Hi, Gene.

46:03.803 --> 46:06.347
-Nora, how're you doing?
-Good!

46:06.430 --> 46:11.143
So, I think the mailman put one
of your letters in my slot by mistake.

46:12.312 --> 46:15.356
Indeed they did. Thank you very much.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.775
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

46:18.359 --> 46:22.321
Is that someone you put in jail
and now they send you threats?

46:22.822 --> 46:24.740
No. Nothing like that.

46:24.824 --> 46:28.077
- Oh, come on. Tell me.
- No, it's not.

46:29.203 --> 46:31.664
A while back, I was into this woman.

46:31.872 --> 46:35.626
Her brother was in prison.
She said, "Could I look at his case?"

46:35.710 --> 46:39.171
I did some investigating.
And there wasn't much I could do.

46:39.255 --> 46:40.923
But I started a correspondence with him,

46:41.007 --> 46:43.884
and I thought it was gonna be
a temporary thing,

46:44.468 --> 46:47.680
and here I am, ten years later,
still getting letters.

46:47.763 --> 46:49.640
So you still read his letters?

46:49.724 --> 46:52.560
Of course! I feel bad tossing 'em.

46:52.643 --> 46:56.313
Besides, every once in a while,
he writes some nice poetry.

46:58.941 --> 47:00.360
What are you up to this evening?

47:00.443 --> 47:02.945
Oh, well, I'm on my own tonight.

47:03.028 --> 47:05.990
Just doing some online gambling.
Carys is with her dad.

47:06.073 --> 47:08.158
-Oh.
-Mmm-hmm.

47:08.242 --> 47:09.702
I'm always on my own.

47:09.785 --> 47:10.828
-Well.
-Yeah.

47:11.746 --> 47:13.330
Would you like to come in?

47:14.415 --> 47:17.126
- Were you working late?
- Um...

47:18.335 --> 47:22.089
No, I was just, uh,
out doing some errands.

47:22.172 --> 47:23.298
-Hmm.
-Not a big deal.

47:28.387 --> 47:29.347
You need another pillow?

47:31.181 --> 47:32.933
Uh, no, I'm comfortable.

47:34.519 --> 47:35.811
-Yeah.
-Mmm-hmm.

47:35.895 --> 47:38.313
-How about some music?
-Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

47:38.398 --> 47:39.649
Fantastic.

47:39.732 --> 47:44.779
You are in luck,
'cause I just started buying 45s.

47:44.862 --> 47:47.448
Last time I collected these,
I was a little kid.

47:47.990 --> 47:51.827
My first 45 was "I Think I Love You"
by the Partridge Family.

47:51.911 --> 47:53.871
Maybe that dates me. I don't know.

47:54.580 --> 47:57.291
Well, anyhow,
this is one of my favorite songs.

48:00.169 --> 48:02.088
Mmm-hmm, that's Elvin Bishop.

48:02.922 --> 48:03.923
Oh...

48:05.007 --> 48:06.091
Yeah.

48:06.175 --> 48:08.177
-This is a good one.
-Yeah.

48:25.194 --> 48:26.862
<i>♪ I must have been... ♪</i>

48:26.946 --> 48:30.700
Elvin's a blues guitarist.
Blues guitarist.

48:30.783 --> 48:32.618
His voice is very gravelly,

48:32.702 --> 48:33.953
and so, he wrote this song

48:34.036 --> 48:36.330
and didn't feel it was right
for his voice.

48:36.413 --> 48:38.082
So he, uh...

48:38.165 --> 48:42.503
He let his, uh, backup singer,
Mickey Thomas, sing the song.

48:42.587 --> 48:45.214
And it went on to be a big hit. Big hit.

48:51.971 --> 48:55.933
Yeah. Yeah.
I like this chair better. Yeah.

48:58.811 --> 49:01.230
<i>♪ I fell in love ♪</i>

49:01.313 --> 49:02.314
Mmm.

49:03.232 --> 49:08.445
I find the wooziness of that guitar

49:08.529 --> 49:10.239
so romantic.

49:10.322 --> 49:11.532
Yeah.

49:17.246 --> 49:20.165
Elvin Bishop's nickname
was Pigboy Crabshaw.

49:20.249 --> 49:22.084
How about that? Pigboy Crabshaw!

49:22.167 --> 49:24.879
Where's a name like that come from?

49:24.962 --> 49:26.296
I'm sorry.

49:27.590 --> 49:30.300
Wow.

49:30.384 --> 49:32.177
-What's going on?
-Oh...

49:33.137 --> 49:35.097
I'm fine.

49:35.180 --> 49:37.808
I am a bit concerned.
You know, you're crying.

49:37.892 --> 49:42.229
No, no, no, no, no.
It's fine. I just, um...

49:42.312 --> 49:43.313
Wow.

49:44.857 --> 49:50.988
That song
is just evoking something

49:51.071 --> 49:57.119
I want so badly for myself that it aches.

49:58.996 --> 50:00.414
For my kid.

50:02.207 --> 50:04.960
I have this dream of owning land.

50:06.295 --> 50:11.091
And, um,
I think about Ojai all the time.

50:11.967 --> 50:15.054
And in my dream,
we have a couple acres. Nothing fancy.

50:15.763 --> 50:21.393
Enough that we have those,
like, big beautiful reaching trees.

50:23.646 --> 50:25.397
And a bunch of dogs.

50:27.274 --> 50:30.653
And they just run through the grass
with Carys, and...

50:32.029 --> 50:34.824
God! I love dogs so much.

50:37.284 --> 50:43.415
And in my fantasy, I'm not, like, staring
into people's decaying mouths anymore.

50:43.499 --> 50:48.837
I'm massaging beautiful dogs for a living.

50:49.338 --> 50:50.506
It's my job.

50:51.757 --> 50:56.011
And I'm spending time with my daughter.

50:56.095 --> 51:00.725
My weird... awesome kid.

51:04.436 --> 51:06.063
And, you know, we're just...

51:06.146 --> 51:09.399
we're so far away
from all of the fighting, and the...

51:09.483 --> 51:14.029
and all the lawyers,
and just all of that crap.

51:17.449 --> 51:18.367
God.

51:19.326 --> 51:23.163
And for some reason...
in this song, I can just...

51:23.247 --> 51:24.832
I can really feel that.

51:28.127 --> 51:30.880
I can feel what it would be like
to have that.

51:33.507 --> 51:34.967
God!

51:35.926 --> 51:37.594
That's why I'm crying.

51:39.513 --> 51:41.682
I have the same exact dream.

51:42.892 --> 51:46.478
- You do?
- Yeah. Exactly the same.

51:47.521 --> 51:50.024
I dream about the open land,

51:50.107 --> 51:53.610
the green, the trees, the dogs.

51:53.694 --> 51:55.738
Specifically, this dog.

51:55.821 --> 52:00.534
And, uh, not being a dog masseuse.
That's not something I'm interested in.

52:00.617 --> 52:01.869
It's not for everybody.

52:01.952 --> 52:06.581
But, um, you know,
I love all that.

52:06.666 --> 52:11.754
And one thing that I don't have,
that you have, is just the family aspect.

52:11.837 --> 52:14.256
I... I dream of having a family. Yeah.

52:15.174 --> 52:16.175
Hmm.

52:19.553 --> 52:22.139
Isn't it so weird

52:22.932 --> 52:28.145
how you can miss something
that you never had?

52:29.063 --> 52:30.064
It is.

52:49.249 --> 52:50.459
You want some tea?

52:53.253 --> 52:54.254
Hmm?

53:01.095 --> 53:03.764
What do you think about a shaved pussy?

53:07.559 --> 53:08.602
What?

53:38.465 --> 53:39.466
Hmm.

53:40.300 --> 53:42.511
Yeah. I'm getting up.

54:45.365 --> 54:46.366
Huh.

55:20.275 --> 55:23.487
Then she mumbled,
"What do you think about a shaved pussy?"

55:23.570 --> 55:25.197
I mean, who says something like that?

55:25.280 --> 55:29.243
Was she casually checking out my opinion?
Was she taking a poll?

55:29.326 --> 55:31.120
Was she gauging my interest?
What is that?

55:31.203 --> 55:34.331
Hey, look, I mean, it could've just been
a point of personal curiosity,

55:34.414 --> 55:37.334
like, "What do you think
of this shade of lipstick?" type of thing.

55:37.417 --> 55:39.503
That's what I'm afraid of.

55:39.586 --> 55:44.049
Yeah. Speaking of which,
I have a very slightly achy vagina today.

55:44.133 --> 55:45.342
I'm so sorry.

55:45.425 --> 55:48.303
Eh, I'm walking a little funny.
I mean, look, it's only slightly.

55:49.263 --> 55:50.764
Mr. Vanderwheel!

55:58.438 --> 56:01.733
-You're a difficult man to get ahold of.
-His girth is nuts.

56:03.110 --> 56:04.153
Hey.

56:04.236 --> 56:08.448
Uh, heard from Sky that you were out here,
uh, hooking up another event,

56:08.532 --> 56:11.035
and so, uh, I just got
a few more questions for you.

56:11.118 --> 56:12.119
That's no problem.

56:12.202 --> 56:16.206
Tell me about the, uh, Lalalime party.

56:16.623 --> 56:19.459
Did I ever tell you? Uh, you know,
I fucked the founder of Lalalime once.

56:19.543 --> 56:21.461
I got a free pair of pants out of it,
so...

56:21.545 --> 56:22.712
-Very helpful.
-Yeah.

56:22.796 --> 56:25.507
Yeah, right, yeah,
we did the show for that party, yeah.

56:25.591 --> 56:27.342
And did you, uh, bring Heather?

56:27.718 --> 56:29.761
Actually, yeah, I did.

56:30.012 --> 56:32.597
When she found out
it was, uh, a celebrity-packed thing,

56:32.681 --> 56:33.765
she begged to come.

56:33.848 --> 56:38.103
Said that I could back off
on buying her expensive finery

56:38.187 --> 56:40.647
in exchange for me bringing her
as my assistant.

56:40.731 --> 56:41.940
Sorry, back up. "Finery"?

56:42.816 --> 56:44.193
What's that?

56:44.276 --> 56:47.029
I don't know.
But she talked about it all the time.

56:47.112 --> 56:49.739
It's luxury clothing for the modern woman.

56:50.324 --> 56:51.825
Okay. What the fuck?

56:51.908 --> 56:53.868
So I know. Shoot me.

56:53.953 --> 56:56.956
Hey, look, was she, uh, talking
to any particular people at this party?

56:57.039 --> 56:58.040
Anything we should know?

56:58.457 --> 57:01.376
I mean, she definitely was
making the rounds,

57:01.460 --> 57:04.671
but I was so busy overseeing
the Dragon Dicks, I couldn't...

57:05.797 --> 57:10.552
Oh, it's, uh... It's an industry nickname
for grounded fountains.

57:10.636 --> 57:13.639
Uh, anyway, I couldn't, like,
keep an eye on her nonstop.

57:14.139 --> 57:16.433
-There were, uh, gift bags there, correct?
-Yeah.

57:16.516 --> 57:18.143
-From, uh, the Silky Lamb?
-What?

57:18.226 --> 57:19.937
-Did you get one?
-Oh, no, no, no, no. No.

57:20.020 --> 57:23.899
Those... those bags weren't for us.
Those were closely guarded.

57:24.483 --> 57:26.109
Apparently, in these bags,

57:26.193 --> 57:29.989
there was a lotion and a cream
that was worth 1,000 bucks.

57:30.572 --> 57:32.491
-You say a lotion and a cream?
-Yeah.

57:32.992 --> 57:34.784
A thousand bucks.
Can you believe that?

57:34.868 --> 57:36.453
Lotion and a cream?

57:36.536 --> 57:38.372
Heather tried to take a bag.
They made her give it back.

57:38.455 --> 57:40.499
Said it was only for famous people.

57:40.707 --> 57:41.959
-Are we good?
-We're good.

57:42.042 --> 57:44.169
-Got all we need. Thank you.
-All right.

57:44.253 --> 57:45.254
Thank you.

57:47.714 --> 57:50.342
Oh, hey, uh,
so listen, I was just thinking, uh...

57:50.425 --> 57:53.387
I think I'm gonna hang back for a second,
get more details on the party.

57:53.470 --> 57:55.180
Nothing you need to concern yourself with,

57:55.263 --> 57:57.015
I just wanna make sure we cover our bases.

57:58.558 --> 58:02.437
Where is this, uh, gonna take place?
I don't see any space for that.

58:02.521 --> 58:04.939
Oh, yeah. Well, you wouldn't, right?
So...

58:11.113 --> 58:11.947
Handsome.

58:12.656 --> 58:16.076
Ingredient analysis on the girl's cream
came back from the lab.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.120
<i>It matches a rarified brand.</i>

58:18.203 --> 58:19.496
Fancy-pants.

58:20.330 --> 58:21.498
Silky Lamb?

58:21.581 --> 58:23.917
<i>-That's it!</i>
-Of course it is.

58:24.001 --> 58:26.503
-Lil' dab'll do ya.
<i>-Indeed, Lester.</i>

58:26.586 --> 58:29.506
A lil' dab'll do ya. Have a good day.

59:55.134 --> 59:56.801
Oh, my fucking back!

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.937
Ow.

01:00:11.816 --> 01:00:13.527
My back. Ow.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:16.280
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:27.207
Yeah. I'll get you some water.

01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:29.042
Oh, is that good!

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:32.546
Look at how delicious this water is!
You're gonna love it.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:34.714
All right. Mmm, diggity.

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:37.342
All right. There you go.

01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:41.304
This'll make you feel better. All right.

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:44.516
Let's get some... air for you.

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:46.643
Ah, there we go.

01:00:49.938 --> 01:00:53.233
Feel better? Feels nice, right?

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:55.194
What we got going on?

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:30.229
Detective, well!

01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:33.273
Come to check on my well-being?
Now that's service.

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:36.235
Yeah. I'm in the service industry.

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.575
I'm sorry, did I interrupt your swim?

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:45.410
Oh, no, it's fine, it's fine.

01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:48.288
You know, there comes a point
at which one can be too fit.

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:49.873
I've gotta watch myself sometimes.

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:53.210
Yeah, as, uh, an actor,
your body is your instrument.

01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:54.378
That's so true.

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:58.715
You know, when I'm performing,
I'm never just delivering a line. I'm...

01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:00.217
vibrating.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:03.720
No wonder the ladies love you so much.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.308
My vibrating isn't something
to joke about.

01:02:09.184 --> 01:02:10.435
Right, right.

01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:17.567
So I just came by to make sure
that all your windows and doors are secure

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:20.153
and nothing could happen, you know...

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:23.365
Well, this is a bit, uh...
Oh, good. All right.

01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:26.951
Yeah. Yeah. That is solid as a rock.

01:02:27.035 --> 01:02:28.620
You are good to go.

01:02:28.703 --> 01:02:30.497
Do you have any other doors like this
in your house?

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.708
-Why, yes! Off the balcony in my bedroom.
-Mmm.

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:35.585
By the way, there's no ice in there.

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:39.673
That's wonderful. After you.

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:46.721
Yeah, you wouldn't want anyone coming
in here while you're sleeping,

01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:47.931
being vulnerable.

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:49.057
Oh, God, no.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.310
My emotional vulnerability is already
at such peak level.

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:53.812
To think I'd also
be physically vulnerable?

01:02:55.897 --> 01:03:00.026
Yeah. Well, you know what?
All tight. All good.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:01.027
Yeah.

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:05.031
Well, looky-looky! How about that?

01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:08.702
Got the Silky Lamb.

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:11.079
How about that?

01:03:11.162 --> 01:03:13.873
You know, I hear great things
about the companion lotion.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:15.083
Do you have that, too?

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:19.004
Well, the lotion I gave to a friend.
The crème is the superior product.

01:03:19.713 --> 01:03:21.465
-The crème <i>?</i>
<i>-</i> Crème <i>.</i>

01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:24.426
Tell me about the crème.

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:29.180
Do you see how well-moisturized I appear,
even though I just got out of the pool?

01:03:29.263 --> 01:03:31.600
You're a very shiny individual.

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:35.979
I applied just a dime-sized dollop
of Silky Lamb

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:38.940
when I got out of bed this morning.
That's it.

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:40.442
No.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:42.986
Yes. It's totally water-resistant.

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:45.279
Fucking genius! I swear by it.

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:46.448
A lil' dab'll do ya.

01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:48.575
Huh?

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:55.665
Well, this takes over the room.
Look at that.

01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:57.501
Oh, yes. That was a gift I received,

01:03:57.584 --> 01:03:59.836
when I wrapped the film
<i>Atlas Shrugged Again.</i>

01:04:00.211 --> 01:04:02.797
Yeah, I don't normally do
light romantic comedies,

01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:07.301
but I felt I wanted to give back
to some of my, well, simpler fans.

01:04:07.386 --> 01:04:10.514
Yeah, that movie.
Huh, can't all be winners.

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:12.265
Um, what?

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:15.352
Oh, please!
That movie was a piece of crap.

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.438
But, come on, that happens.

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:20.524
Oh, that reminds me.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.526
Remember the last time we saw each other,

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:27.614
we talked about, uh,
your movie <i>Patty-Cake?</i>

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:29.991
You know, the movie you watched

01:04:30.074 --> 01:04:34.746
the night that that monster dropped
that body off on your front lawn.

01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:37.832
Yes, that was a terrifying evening.
I shall never forget it.

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:42.462
Well, I watched it because
you got me intrigued by your performance.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:44.714
-And?
-Well...

01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:46.591
Well, what?

01:04:46.675 --> 01:04:48.342
You were a kid.
What did you know?

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:53.390
Well, I'm sorry.
You don't know what you're talking about.

01:04:53.473 --> 01:04:55.850
Oh, come on. Those line readings?

01:04:56.935 --> 01:04:59.813
Bit histrionic, don't you think?
Heavy-handed.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:04.859
It's as if you were attempting to act,
as opposed to just acting.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:11.116
How fucking dare you.

01:05:11.199 --> 01:05:12.784
I was luminous!

01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:14.953
I fucking killed it.

01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:20.333
Those scenes hold up,
you fucking half-wit!

01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:23.962
You've got quite a temper.

01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:29.467
I betcha Heather Dromgoole
brought out your dark side

01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:33.054
when she made fun of your performance
right to your face.

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:38.685
-Never met her.
-Oh, I think otherwise.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:43.272
As a matter of fact,
I've got a half-wit theory about it.

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:56.119
<i>I think you met Heather</i>
<i>at the Lalalime party.</i>

01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:03.376
<i>I think when she was denied</i>
<i>a Silky Lamb gift bag,</i>

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.545
<i>she went looking for a celebrity.</i>

01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:07.130
<i>And she found you.</i>

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:27.358
<i>She came home with you.</i>
<i>You two had sex to seal the deal.</i>

01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:36.242
<i>And she landed that Silky Lamb lotion</i>
<i>as a parting gift.</i>

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:50.131
<i>She stopped by the night of the murder.</i>
<i>Things got sexy again.</i>

01:06:50.214 --> 01:06:54.302
<i>I think you creamed Heather head to toe</i>
<i>before you made love to her.</i>

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:13.780
<i>After sex, you two were lounging around,</i>
<i>flipping through the channels.</i>

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:17.492
Ooh! Oh! It's my movie.

01:07:17.576 --> 01:07:21.705
<i>You found your own movie!</i>
<i>You never pass up watching your own movie.</i>

01:07:21.788 --> 01:07:23.873
This is the worst thing I've ever seen.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:26.960
<i>I think Heather made fun</i>
<i>of your crappy performance.</i>

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:30.630
Is this, like, before you took
acting classes? This thing sucks.

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:33.216
Patty-cake, patty-cake, baker's man.

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:34.843
<i>She had a bad habit of that.</i>

01:07:34.926 --> 01:07:38.012
<i>You know, people I talked to</i>
<i>said she liked to do a little ribbing.</i>

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:43.226
I think she was standing about right here.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:48.231
And then you got angry.
Yeah, real angry.

01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:52.735
<i>You shoved Heather</i>
<i>from a dark place of inner rage.</i>

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:56.364
<i>But I think she was very greasy.</i>
<i>Very slippery.</i>

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:59.576
<i>And she fell backwards into your statue,</i>

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:02.954
<i>which, of course, explains</i>
<i>the globe-shaped dent in her head.</i>

01:08:03.037 --> 01:08:07.208
<i>A woman lay dead on your floor</i>
<i>because of your fragile ego.</i>

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:09.127
And then you panicked.

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:12.005
And you went to your neighbor's garage
and you chopped her up

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:15.759
to make it look like it was
some sort of serial killer type thing.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:19.428
Your cuts were so profoundly sloppy

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:21.640
because your hands were heavily creamed,

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:24.100
the tools slipping in and out.

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:28.312
And then you chopped up her body
and threw it out on your front lawn.

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:30.607
Like a pile of dog shit.

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:35.403
'Cause who's gonna suspect a killer
of dumping a body on their own front lawn?

01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:38.572
Now here's where I was really confused.

01:08:38.657 --> 01:08:41.701
The Star of David?
That one had me miffed.

01:08:41.785 --> 01:08:43.828
And then, I figured it out!

01:08:43.912 --> 01:08:47.081
You're a self-loathing Jew.
You're a self-loathing Jew.

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:52.712
You bastard!

01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:55.256
-You're gonna end up dead on my lawn, too!
-Get off me!

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:10.604
Freeze, asshole!

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:15.026
-How?
-The sliding door by the pool.

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:18.446
But you checked the door.
You jiggled the handle!

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:21.866
That was a fake jiggle, my friend.

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:23.868
I should be an actor.

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:33.252
Well... I guess that explains
why my vagina was achy all morning.

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:34.377
Why's that?

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:38.049
Well, you know, it knew you were gonna
need help. It was pulsing a warning.

01:09:38.131 --> 01:09:40.134
So that's your finely-tuned intuition?

01:09:40.218 --> 01:09:42.011
Oh, yeah. Either that or,

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:44.596
you know, my pussy can't handle
more than four toes anymore.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.974
I hope it's not that.

01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:48.977
-I love you for so many reasons.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.689
Hey, Bacorn, nice bathrobe.

01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:55.524
Fuck you, Joe Kenda. Fuck you!

01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:58.027
You wouldn't like me. I just lay there.

01:10:03.157 --> 01:10:05.159
-Lieutenant.
-Detective Handsome.

01:10:05.243 --> 01:10:07.286
I told you it was the ex-boyfriend.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:10.957
The old "If I can't have you,
no one can have you" trick.

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:15.628
Yeah, that's a... that's a good theory,
uh, but he's not the ex...

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:19.298
Well, yes, he's the ex-boyfriend.
Good one. Good theory.

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:24.345
What the fuck?

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:27.849
Hi. What is going on here?

01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:30.434
Hi. Detective Handsome, LAPD.

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:32.103
-Kaley. You know...
-Hi, Kaley.

01:10:32.186 --> 01:10:33.271
I live right there.

01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:34.522
-You live right there.
-Yeah.

01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:35.689
So it's your dog.

01:10:35.773 --> 01:10:38.401
-Oh, my God, is... is my dog okay?
-Dog's good.

01:10:38.985 --> 01:10:41.988
Oh. What is this shit going on
next to my house, man?

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:44.949
Uh, your neighbor, uh, murdered somebody.

01:10:45.033 --> 01:10:47.368
This is ridiculous.
I just got back from vacation.

01:10:47.451 --> 01:10:50.704
And here I am, coming back
to all this commotion next to my house.

01:10:50.789 --> 01:10:52.706
Wait a second.
You're Kaley Cuoco.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.835
-Yeah.
-Wow.

01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:57.879
-I love saying your name.
-Oh.

01:10:57.962 --> 01:10:59.422
-It's a delight.
-That's nice.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:01.174
It rolls off the tongue. Kaley Cuoco.

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.676
Do you need any help solving this one?

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.053
-No, we're good.
-Okay.

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:07.972
Even though you're Kaley Cuoco
and I'd love to say, "Come on in."

01:11:08.056 --> 01:11:09.182
- Okay.
- It's all solved.

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:11.350
-All right. Great.
-He's being taken away.

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:12.476
This is so fucked up.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.937
You know what... Driver!
Take me back to the airport.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:18.274
-Enjoy your good looks.
-All right.

01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:19.358
Wow.

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:26.240
<i>"A Lil' Epilogue'll Do Ya."</i>

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:31.287
Wow, I am so lucky that I met you.

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:35.041
Honestly,
I look at your face and I just...

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:38.127
I don't even know
how to talk about it.

01:11:38.211 --> 01:11:41.130
Seriously, this feeling I have is just...

01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:44.092
bigger than anything
I could ever explain to you.

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:46.177
I cannot believe that you...

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.554
Miss, we're just about wrapped up inside
and ready to bail.

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:51.850
Great! Thank you.
You can call me Nora.

01:11:51.933 --> 01:11:54.477
Hmm, Nora it is.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.813
And we found this Tupperware of cookies
on the side of the washer.

01:11:56.896 --> 01:11:57.981
You taking these with?

01:11:58.064 --> 01:11:59.816
Oh, no, those are gross.
You can toss them out.

01:11:59.899 --> 01:12:00.984
All right.

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:03.820
Hmm.

01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:09.575
Anyway, back to what I was saying before.

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:13.454
I cannot believe you have done this
for me. I really can't.

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:17.917
Well, if a person can make someone else
happy, they ought to do it, right?

01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:21.921
Right. I can tell it makes you a little
uncomfortable to be thanked, so I'll stop.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.798
We were gonna have you up
once we get settled,

01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:27.844
but then I realized
you would not be comfortable with that.

01:12:27.927 --> 01:12:29.720
I don't think
I'd be uncomfortable with--

01:12:29.803 --> 01:12:32.849
Yeah, no, I know you would hate
that power dynamic.

01:12:32.932 --> 01:12:37.228
Me, just, like, so grateful.
You, a goddamn angel.

01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:38.980
I don't know that
I would go calling me an angel.

01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:40.731
Yeah. And like an angel,

01:12:40.814 --> 01:12:43.817
it's better for you
to just stay at a distance.

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:45.194
Observe from the clouds.

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:50.449
You don't want me calling you
and sticking around in your life.

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:53.119
I know you would not be comfortable
with an arrangement like that,

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:54.370
so I'll save you from the pressure.

01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:55.746
I'd be comfortable.
It'd be okay.

01:12:55.829 --> 01:12:57.165
Yeah. Carys!

01:12:57.248 --> 01:12:58.499
Honey, come here.

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:03.880
I want you to say thank you to Gene
before we never see him again, okay?

01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:05.048
I don't want to.

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:06.215
- That's okay.
- Carys.

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:08.551
-She doesn't have to, it's not--
-I wasn't finished.

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:11.345
I don't wanna thank him in words.

01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:14.182
I'll thank him with a dance.

01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:20.438
This is the shining youth of America.

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:37.663
Yes, yes, yes.

01:13:47.798 --> 01:13:48.799
Ha!

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:59.060
Well, I think I should be thanking you.

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:01.562
That was something.

01:14:02.521 --> 01:14:03.606
Hmm.

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:10.529
Goodbye, Gene.

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:13.532
Forever.

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:20.539
We're all good, Nora.

01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:26.379
- Oh, okay.
- Mmm.

01:14:28.006 --> 01:14:29.715
Mmm...

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:32.676
Mmm.

01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:34.928
Mmm.

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:37.348
Ah.

01:14:40.018 --> 01:14:42.520
- Oh, boy.
- Mmm.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:44.605
Mmm.

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:11.132
Boy, uh...
that's, uh, not what I expected.

01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:15.052
It is what it is. Yeah.

01:15:17.846 --> 01:15:19.640
<i>Au revoir,</i> Detective.

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:23.061
-Yeah, later, Charles.
-Yeah. Excuse me.

01:15:25.063 --> 01:15:26.064
Um...

01:15:27.398 --> 01:15:29.733
-You're in... you're in my way.
-Yeah, yeah.

01:15:31.069 --> 01:15:32.945
Yeah, come on.
Candy, over here.

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:34.738
-Okay.
-All right.

01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:43.539
All right, come on, sweetie.
Let's go, come on.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.465
Hey, Handsome!

01:15:52.965 --> 01:15:54.967
Neighbors moving out already?

01:15:56.969 --> 01:15:58.096
Shh.

01:15:58.179 --> 01:16:00.264
It's okay.

01:16:00.348 --> 01:16:02.475
Yeah, she's heading out to Ojai.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:04.560
She got a couple acres
and a little farmhouse.

01:16:04.643 --> 01:16:05.978
What's she gonna do out there?

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:08.606
Well, she's given up
being a dental assistant.

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:11.734
She's gonna go into canine massage.

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:13.944
She found a program there.

01:16:14.027 --> 01:16:18.157
Two hundred hours, you're in.
It's kind of holistic. She's very excited.

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:21.952
Wonder what kind of money
you can make massaging dogs.

01:16:22.536 --> 01:16:23.412
She'll be fine.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.252
It is what it is.

01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:35.841
Later.

01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:38.761
Coming, Esta!

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:47.060
Yeah. Go ahead.
