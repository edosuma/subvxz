00:36.570 --> 00:42.179
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:55.289 --> 00:57.600
The killer didn't leave footprints anywhere in the house.

00:57.700 --> 01:00.429
We didn't find the killer's fingerprints or saliva on the scene.

01:01.270 --> 01:03.469
All we found was her family's fingerprints.

01:04.500 --> 01:05.569
Most importantly,

01:06.269 --> 01:09.840
those with the clearest motive for murdering her...

01:10.480 --> 01:11.540
are her family members.

01:17.980 --> 01:20.120
Everyone in the family except for Ms. Woo A Jin...

01:20.450 --> 01:22.319
will be questioned as witnesses starting today,

01:22.549 --> 01:24.920
so your cooperation is required.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.530
(Gangnam Police Station)

01:27.659 --> 01:30.959
The time of death is presumed to be around 2am. on February 28.

01:31.359 --> 01:35.469
The first call to the police was made at 9:17am that day.

01:35.599 --> 01:37.739
Now, I'll go over who's on our list of suspects.

01:38.239 --> 01:39.239
Ahn Tae Dong.

01:39.299 --> 01:43.269
Park Ji Yeong's husband who has enough motive to kill her.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.510
Ahn Jae Gu.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.549
Ahn Tae Dong's eldest child...

01:48.780 --> 01:50.680
who was even charged with attempted murder in the past.

01:50.780 --> 01:53.319
He's definitely one of our prime suspects.

01:54.049 --> 01:55.049
Ahn Jae Hui.

01:55.349 --> 01:56.859
She's Ahn Tae Dong's second child.

01:57.019 --> 01:58.159
Even though she was...

01:58.420 --> 02:00.530
in the same space as the victim on the day of the incident,

02:00.590 --> 02:03.030
but she lied in her statement by saying that she wasn't with her.

02:03.859 --> 02:06.530
Park Ju Mi. She's married to Ahn Tae Dong's eldest son.

02:06.870 --> 02:10.370
She has no alibi for the day of the murder, and the statements...

02:10.598 --> 02:12.240
we received from people around the victim...

02:12.300 --> 02:13.669
make her one of our prime suspects.

02:33.889 --> 02:34.960
She died from TBI.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.900
There's nothing that shows she was raped.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.430
There are no signs of resistance either.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.069
The killer hit her here twice with a blunt weapon.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.900
The artery ruptured right away.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.009
We don't even have any space to store the body.

02:47.310 --> 02:48.439
Please get her transferred soon.

02:51.710 --> 02:52.909
Okay.

02:58.620 --> 02:59.750
Who do you think did it?

03:01.349 --> 03:02.819
I thought it was her, but I was wrong.

03:03.219 --> 03:05.060
She's the only one with a firm alibi.

03:08.090 --> 03:10.400
So, Park Bok Ja.

03:11.199 --> 03:13.530
I mean, Ms. Park Ji Yeong. You said you met her for the first time...

03:14.030 --> 03:15.800
when you interviewed her for the caregiver position,

03:15.900 --> 03:19.770
but we did some digging and found that the two of you go way back.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.610
Do you really not remember?

03:32.819 --> 03:34.919
Can I be born again?

03:36.250 --> 03:37.759
If I can,

03:39.520 --> 03:40.930
I don't want to live as Park Bok Ja.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.530
I want to live as the woman who watched the moment...

03:46.699 --> 03:48.030
I became a handful of ashes...

03:49.069 --> 03:52.099
even if it's just once.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.889
We all want to be happy...

04:07.719 --> 04:09.990
and covet the things that we don't have.

04:11.159 --> 04:14.159
From the intense pressure and belief that it's the only way to happiness,

04:14.259 --> 04:16.060
our lives begin.

04:17.759 --> 04:21.699
But we can't control anything in life...

04:21.769 --> 04:24.269
from how it begins to how it ends.

04:26.139 --> 04:29.740
This is a story about me and the woman who dreamed...

04:31.009 --> 04:32.310
of becoming like me.

04:36.750 --> 04:39.519
Residents of Gangnam-gu pay 15 percent of the city tax,

04:39.620 --> 04:42.420
but receive no benefit. I understand why people are saying that.

04:42.519 --> 04:45.759
That amounts to 1.7 billion dollars.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.629
It rightfully belongs to Gangnam.

04:47.790 --> 04:51.660
Plus, the residents will have to put up with all the noise.

04:51.730 --> 04:55.300
It's because people are insecure. They want Gangnam out of Seoul.

04:55.370 --> 04:56.800
I'd actually appreciate that.

04:56.870 --> 04:58.839
Then, Gangnam can become a self-governing district.

04:59.670 --> 05:00.709
Hello.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.540
Hi!

05:07.110 --> 05:08.449
Hello, ladies.

05:08.810 --> 05:11.579
- Am I late? - We'll cut you some slack.

05:11.850 --> 05:14.319
A Jin, is that clutch a limited edition?

05:14.850 --> 05:16.819
- No. - I think I've seen it.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.589
- No, it's not. - Right.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.990
Have you checked out the new high-end shop in Bupyeong?

05:21.160 --> 05:23.290
That shop. You know Park Gyeong Hun in Class Four, right?

05:23.360 --> 05:26.360
Isn't his mom the one who gave me the lash extension lady's number?

05:26.459 --> 05:27.470
That's right.

05:27.529 --> 05:30.699
The class president's mom got her eyebrows tattooed through his mom,

05:30.800 --> 05:31.839
and they look so natural.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.339
Her husband owns that outlet.

05:34.740 --> 05:37.240
He must have a coinvestor, right? They don't seem that well-off.

05:38.079 --> 05:39.540
Do you know her number?

05:40.079 --> 05:43.149
- Why do you need her number? - I want the tattoo place's number.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.850
- Do you want to get it done? - Not me. It's for my husband.

05:47.819 --> 05:49.750
The tarot reader in Apgujeong told me.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.160
You're in trouble.

05:54.959 --> 05:56.259
Your husband will cheat on you.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.029
- Pardon? - Your husband is weak-willed,

05:59.129 --> 06:01.029
and he even has two earth in his natal chart.

06:01.529 --> 06:04.500
It represents his spouse, which means he's destined to have two.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.410
That's crazy. So?

06:07.509 --> 06:10.509
You're not about to tell me to slip a talisman in his underwear.

06:10.579 --> 06:11.879
I'm not a shaman.

06:12.079 --> 06:14.180
I guess you don't know. Even shamans come to me for readings...

06:14.279 --> 06:17.019
to find out when their abilities will start wearing out.

06:19.050 --> 06:20.589
So, what should I do then?

06:23.759 --> 06:25.620
You need to change his physiognomy.

06:26.290 --> 06:27.790
Through plastic surgery?

06:28.490 --> 06:29.889
That'd be the best,

06:30.529 --> 06:32.500
but it looks like he's handsome.

06:33.300 --> 06:34.470
He doesn't need any work done.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.329
Do the cards even tell you about his looks?

06:36.430 --> 06:39.740
Of course. He's rich and handsome.

06:43.139 --> 06:45.180
Plus, you have him wrapped around your finger.

06:45.339 --> 06:47.550
Then, why would he fall for another woman?

06:47.709 --> 06:49.509
That's just his fate, okay?

06:49.910 --> 06:51.180
So, what should I do?

06:54.720 --> 06:56.250
Try making his eyebrows look thicker.

06:57.220 --> 06:58.959
His brows are quite wimpy and sparse, aren't they?

07:01.389 --> 07:03.500
Don't they look like foxtails?

07:04.459 --> 07:07.000
Thicken them. Make them look like caterpillars.

07:07.430 --> 07:10.500
That will block another woman's energy flowing in.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.610
Caterpillars, okay?

07:14.110 --> 07:15.139
That's absurd.

07:15.209 --> 07:18.839
But you can't just ignore it when you hear something like that.

07:19.680 --> 07:20.709
Goodness.

07:20.709 --> 07:22.750
If thickening your husband's eyebrows can prevent his affairs,

07:22.850 --> 07:25.550
every husband in this country should have heavy caterpillar brows.

07:26.720 --> 07:29.850
Gi Ok, do you think that your husband will never cheat on you?

07:31.220 --> 07:33.589
Well, I probably wouldn't care if I never find out about it.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.759
Ms. Baek, you said you'll change the kids' math study guide, right?

07:37.529 --> 07:40.029
A new in-depth study guide for the math competition just came out.

07:40.129 --> 07:42.000
The questions will likely be based on it.

07:42.230 --> 07:43.470
I'll get all the kids on it.

07:43.670 --> 07:46.500
Math is the determining factor for which university kids can enter.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.269
Those who give up on math basically have to give up on life.

07:49.569 --> 07:50.639
But Ms. Baek,

07:51.079 --> 07:54.350
you should make kids take a test and only accept those who pass it.

07:55.149 --> 07:57.279
If you continue to accept academically incompetent kids,

07:57.620 --> 07:59.680
moms in prestigious families won't send their kids to you.

08:01.449 --> 08:04.490
I'm running a math institute because I have to earn a living,

08:04.790 --> 08:07.230
but I don't want to discriminate against a certain group of kids.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.829
The smart ones will excel even without my lessons.

08:10.959 --> 08:12.930
Those who are struggling in school need my help.

08:13.899 --> 08:15.399
That is so true.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.699
You're a true educator.

08:20.310 --> 08:21.439
(Jin Hui)

08:22.370 --> 08:23.480
- I have to take this. - Okay.

08:24.540 --> 08:25.639
A Jin?

08:26.110 --> 08:28.910
I told Ms. Park Bok Ja, to come at 3pm.

08:29.149 --> 08:32.549
She's so different from other candidates.

08:33.149 --> 08:35.549
She can use smartphone apps without any difficulties.

08:36.289 --> 08:38.990
She said she just needs the address as she can use the navigation app.

08:39.190 --> 08:41.889
Also, her voice sounded honest and kind.

08:43.029 --> 08:44.029
Yes.

08:46.029 --> 08:48.769
I'm at the store now to change strings on Ji Hu's violin.

08:49.370 --> 08:52.570
I'll go to the gallery after this and pick up the painting.

08:58.379 --> 09:00.610
Even this teacup is so pretty.

09:00.750 --> 09:03.620
It's pretty, isn't it? We must have similar taste.

09:03.850 --> 09:05.250
I like this teacup too.

09:06.789 --> 09:09.549
It looks like one of Henri Matisse's paintings.

09:10.620 --> 09:11.960
It is his painting.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.490
I knew it.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.490
Do you like art?

09:16.590 --> 09:18.830
I just enjoy looking at paintings.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.929
Life is tough.

09:21.830 --> 09:25.169
Looking at paintings gives me peace of mind.

09:25.299 --> 09:28.840
Maybe we were meant to meet. I'm a big fan of Matisse's works too.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.179
Is that right?

09:30.580 --> 09:32.809
I do like his paintings,

09:33.240 --> 09:35.809
but I actually like Manet more.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.450
This is amazing. We should go to a gallery together.

09:40.519 --> 09:42.419
I'd be honored.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.490
Gosh. Did you go to art school?

09:45.590 --> 09:46.990
I studied fashion design.

09:48.590 --> 09:49.860
I see.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.970
Well, Ms. Woo.

09:55.169 --> 09:56.200
Yes.

09:56.399 --> 09:59.870
I'll take great care of him.

10:00.139 --> 10:03.070
I've worked as a caregiver for a number of patients.

10:03.379 --> 10:05.509
When people are physically ill,

10:05.879 --> 10:08.309
they actually suffer more emotionally.

10:08.509 --> 10:12.250
Even those who were openhearted become apathetic and unkind.

10:13.120 --> 10:16.419
Doctors will use medicine to cure him physically,

10:16.820 --> 10:18.960
so I'd like to help him heal his heart...

10:19.090 --> 10:22.090
by doing my very best.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.799
Please give me a chance.

10:25.330 --> 10:27.700
I'll do my utmost to take great care of him.

10:28.700 --> 10:32.039
Please help him so that he can become happier...

10:32.399 --> 10:33.639
and healthier.

10:33.769 --> 10:35.870
I'll give you a raise if his condition improves.

10:36.039 --> 10:37.039
Please help us out.

10:37.539 --> 10:40.580
Then, does that mean I'm hired?

10:40.710 --> 10:43.279
Yes, you can start tomorrow.

10:45.379 --> 10:47.350
What are my hours going to be like?

10:47.750 --> 10:51.620
Father usually goes to bed at 10pm and wakes up at 7am,

10:51.720 --> 10:53.429
- so I guess... - How about...

10:53.960 --> 10:56.360
you hire me as a live-in caregiver?

10:59.129 --> 11:02.600
I mean, I'm sure he has to drink water in the middle of the night.

11:02.970 --> 11:04.899
He'll want to go to the bathroom as well.

11:07.370 --> 11:09.340
Will that be okay with you?

11:10.179 --> 11:13.679
We'd really appreciate it.

11:13.809 --> 11:16.450
Goodness. What can I do?

11:16.720 --> 11:20.389
Caregiving isn't a nine-to-five job.

11:22.549 --> 11:25.559
May I take a look at your china?

11:25.620 --> 11:26.929
Of course, have a look.

11:28.389 --> 11:30.799
Did you pick this out too?

11:30.929 --> 11:31.960
Yes, I did.

11:33.529 --> 11:35.600
Do you like Piet Mondrian?

11:35.929 --> 11:38.340
Yes. Do you like his three primary colors?

11:38.769 --> 11:41.340
I actually have a deeper appreciation...

11:41.669 --> 11:44.539
for Wassily Kandinsky's style of work.

11:53.620 --> 11:56.889
I'll bring my stuff tomorrow and start working right away then.

11:57.019 --> 11:59.889
Sure. Just bring what you'll need for about a week.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.090
We'll send a car to your place to move heavy things.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.929
Just focus on looking after Father. We'll take care of the rest.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.970
Thank you very much.

12:08.799 --> 12:10.769
Then, I'll get going.

12:10.870 --> 12:12.500
Okay, goodbye.

12:15.370 --> 12:16.779
Well, Ms. Woo.

12:17.779 --> 12:18.809
Yes.

12:19.940 --> 12:23.620
You're really beautiful.

12:25.980 --> 12:27.019
Thank you.

12:28.190 --> 12:29.190
I'll see you tomorrow.

12:54.710 --> 12:58.049
Our destiny is predetermined at birth,

12:59.480 --> 13:02.850
and it's too cruel to some of us.

13:03.419 --> 13:05.289
Our social class is decided for us,

13:05.690 --> 13:08.190
and moving up in the hierarchy is not allowed in most cases.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.799
About the artist, Jeon Gi Yeong,

13:11.200 --> 13:14.200
you recognized his talent before anyone else did five years ago.

13:14.370 --> 13:17.500
Everyone else thought that Choi Sun Ji would be the next star,

13:17.740 --> 13:21.710
but you supported Jeon Gi Yeong's works,

13:21.769 --> 13:24.710
saying that he'll become the greatest contemporary artist.

13:25.039 --> 13:27.879
Now, he can practically charge however much he wants for his works.

13:28.509 --> 13:29.779
You have such a good eye.

13:29.879 --> 13:31.580
What's this artist like?

13:31.820 --> 13:33.250
In what aspect?

13:33.720 --> 13:37.289
In the association alone, there are over 50 artists who mimic...

13:37.360 --> 13:39.860
Andy Warhol or Roy Lichtenstein's works.

13:40.129 --> 13:41.629
Will she keep her own distinct style?

13:41.690 --> 13:42.889
I can guarantee that.

13:43.259 --> 13:45.059
Her unique perspective and strong self-esteem...

13:45.159 --> 13:48.370
already supersede that of Julian Opie and Damien Hirst.

13:49.129 --> 13:52.100
Isn't that why you chose her?

14:00.879 --> 14:03.820
Gosh, that hurts. The needle pricked my skin. It hurts so much.

14:04.379 --> 14:05.919
Why on earth do I have to get this done?

14:06.080 --> 14:08.549
It'll make you become successful. It'll help you lock in cash flow.

14:08.620 --> 14:10.659
Gosh, do you actually think that makes sense?

14:10.759 --> 14:12.220
Yes, I do.

14:16.559 --> 14:19.360
You and your friends believe in superstitions too much.

14:19.460 --> 14:21.230
Please be gentle.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.110
Have you done a background check on her?

14:34.879 --> 14:35.879
Not yet.

14:36.879 --> 14:38.580
I'm sure you'll like her though.

14:38.649 --> 14:41.850
But still, ask her social security number so that we can vet her.

14:41.950 --> 14:43.090
Don't worry.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.259
By the way, she sent her resume via e-mail.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.460
Really? She sure keeps up with technology.

14:48.860 --> 14:49.860
How old is she?

14:50.360 --> 14:52.500
She was born in 1972, so she's 45 this year.

14:53.529 --> 14:55.299
- Isn't she too young then? - Is she pretty?

14:58.899 --> 15:00.169
Why do you need to know that?

15:00.840 --> 15:02.570
Looks matter to me a great deal.

15:03.580 --> 15:06.039
She seems to have a great personality,

15:06.139 --> 15:09.250
- That means she's not pretty. - You'll like her.

15:09.350 --> 15:11.419
I'll fire her if that's not the case.

15:14.049 --> 15:15.220
Are you wearing makeup?

15:16.990 --> 15:20.389
- No, I'm not. - Your brows look like caterpillars.

15:25.399 --> 15:28.629
It looks like Dad needs new hearing aids.

15:28.799 --> 15:30.139
He's getting louder and louder.

15:32.169 --> 15:33.240
I want to pee.

15:49.789 --> 15:51.659
Did you get your ballet shoes from Aunt Jin Hui?

15:52.059 --> 15:54.090
My feet must've grown. My toes hurt.

15:54.289 --> 15:56.259
She said I need to get new ones.

15:56.429 --> 15:58.330
Then, how about you just quit ballet now?

15:58.960 --> 16:01.429
I don't care either way.

16:01.769 --> 16:03.470
Your legs will get muscular if you keep doing it.

16:03.539 --> 16:05.100
I just wanted to fix your figure.

16:05.169 --> 16:07.840
The plan was to learn it for only two years anyway, right?

16:08.039 --> 16:11.740
Ballet is all right, but I actually want to stop learning Chinese.

16:11.980 --> 16:14.879
Say that in Chinese. "I want to stop learning Chinese."

16:16.879 --> 16:20.250
Just keep taking the lessons until you can say that in Chinese, okay?

16:22.789 --> 16:23.789
Bye.

16:24.220 --> 16:27.889
I can't believe Dad still goes on about women's looks at that age.

16:28.490 --> 16:30.659
I think that lady will be great for the job.

16:30.759 --> 16:32.299
She has worked a lot as a caregiver.

16:32.500 --> 16:36.169
But she seems very intelligent. She even knows Matisse and Kandinsky.

16:36.470 --> 16:37.500
What's that?

16:38.299 --> 16:39.370
What do you think?

16:39.539 --> 16:42.240
Matisse and Kandinsky. Are they dog breeds?

16:43.139 --> 16:44.210
New whiskey?

16:44.279 --> 16:45.580
They're artists.

16:45.940 --> 16:48.250
They sound too generic. Artists' names should be more unique...

16:48.350 --> 16:50.049
like van Gogh, Gauguin, and Picasso.

16:50.379 --> 16:52.620
By the way, how does she know about those artists?

16:52.750 --> 16:54.419
They have nothing to do with caregiving.

16:55.090 --> 16:57.460
It's okay that you don't know who Matisse and Kandinsky are,

16:57.720 --> 17:00.490
but the way you think makes you look so ignorant.

17:00.590 --> 17:01.990
What? Ignorant?

17:02.429 --> 17:04.130
Gosh. Aren't you taking that back?

17:04.200 --> 17:07.029
I never take back what I already said. Forget it if it bothers you.

17:07.299 --> 17:09.170
- Ji Hu. - How can I forget?

17:09.269 --> 17:11.500
You said I'm ignorant. How can I forget hearing it?

17:11.670 --> 17:12.970
Take it back already!

17:13.368 --> 17:15.009
("History of 20th-Century Art")

18:02.089 --> 18:03.119
Hello?

18:05.660 --> 18:07.559
Don't you worry. I'll do a good job.

18:09.690 --> 18:11.099
Keep your lips sealed yourself.

18:13.630 --> 18:14.670
Yes.

18:15.299 --> 18:16.529
All right.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.970
(Ms. Woo A Jin)

18:24.680 --> 18:26.079
My gosh, Ms. Woo.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.349
Yes. You need a copy of my social security card?

18:30.049 --> 18:33.549
Yes, that's no problem. I'll bring it tomorrow.

18:34.250 --> 18:35.920
Gosh, please don't worry about it.

18:36.019 --> 18:37.059
Yes.

18:37.789 --> 18:39.920
Hiring the right person is so important.

18:40.089 --> 18:42.329
You have to be careful about whom you hire.

18:42.829 --> 18:44.960
Would you need my family register too?

18:46.930 --> 18:50.039
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

19:07.190 --> 19:09.619
Push out. All the way.

19:13.089 --> 19:14.559
Please try to hold it when you go down.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.369
I heard that both of his sons are helpless.

19:25.500 --> 19:29.140
He sent his elder son to the States after he beat someone to death.

19:29.509 --> 19:31.640
His younger son is the big shot in the company,

19:31.740 --> 19:33.140
but even he's not that capable.

19:33.680 --> 19:34.880
Is he seriously ill?

19:34.950 --> 19:37.920
He's had a stroke. He's suffering from diabetes complications.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.250
His hearing is bad too.

19:40.289 --> 19:43.220
Did you tell him that he should hire a caregiver?

19:43.359 --> 19:45.920
I told him again today. He said he'd talk to his daughter-in-law.

20:00.839 --> 20:02.640
- I'll head out first. - Oh, wait.

20:05.039 --> 20:06.109
Buy whatever you want to get.

20:07.079 --> 20:08.779
- Okay. - Bye, Min Su.

20:08.910 --> 20:10.779
I'll see you next time we play golf, Seong Ju.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.190
I didn't know...

20:14.289 --> 20:16.960
that there was a way you can change your name without a court visit.

20:19.089 --> 20:22.829
Then, there are people who are dying...

20:22.990 --> 20:24.759
to make their name known as soon as possible.

20:24.930 --> 20:25.960
(Romantic French-girl style)

20:25.960 --> 20:27.670
(What's the difference between waiting and longing?)

20:34.309 --> 20:35.509
And there are also people...

20:35.839 --> 20:39.210
who are trying to keep their children's names in the dark.

20:39.380 --> 20:42.109
Ms. Woo A Jin, who was formerly named the best flight attendant...

20:42.480 --> 20:44.680
will give a special lecture for us today.

20:44.750 --> 20:46.750
They're now used to being addressed...

20:47.089 --> 20:49.119
as someone's mom instead of by their own names,

20:49.619 --> 20:52.920
but some of them are lucky enough to get opportunities...

20:53.059 --> 20:54.630
to use their names from time to time.

20:54.660 --> 20:55.690
(Woo A Jin)

20:58.299 --> 20:59.859
- Please take him to the hospital. - Yes, ma'am.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.599
I don't want to get that injection today.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.869
You're not getting any injection today, Father.

21:03.970 --> 21:06.200
Dr. Jo said that he'd just like to see how you're doing.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.339
That jerk looks like a con man.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.309
That's not true, Father. What are you talking about?

21:11.380 --> 21:13.380
You trust people too much.

21:14.210 --> 21:16.880
That's why you married that idiot, Jae Seok.

21:28.329 --> 21:29.789
(1 missed call Curator Park Eun Seo)

21:34.670 --> 21:36.329
Ms. Park, I just saw that I missed your call.

21:36.599 --> 21:39.799
The artist, Yun Seong Hui really would like to meet you.

21:40.039 --> 21:41.470
May I give her your number?

21:41.809 --> 21:44.180
No, you can just give me her number.

21:44.509 --> 21:45.509
I'll call her.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.250
Thank you so much, Ms. Woo.

21:48.349 --> 21:50.779
I'm honored that you're my first client.

21:51.019 --> 21:52.250
It's my pleasure.

21:52.750 --> 21:55.750
A close friend of mine is married to the president of Hawon Group.

21:55.890 --> 21:59.259
She has a gallery and is looking for a talented rookie artist.

21:59.589 --> 22:00.660
I'll introduce you to her.

22:00.789 --> 22:02.930
I'd be honored to meet her. Thank you.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.529
Please produce good work.

22:05.359 --> 22:08.329
I'm investing in you.

22:09.130 --> 22:11.000
It's rude to say such things to artists, isn't it?

22:11.299 --> 22:12.339
Not at all.

22:12.500 --> 22:15.039
Art can't be separated from the commercial world.

22:15.309 --> 22:18.009
It's not like money will fall into my lap so that I can buy paints.

22:20.480 --> 22:21.910
By the way, you're so beautiful.

22:24.049 --> 22:25.950
I'm flattered. Thank you.

22:26.890 --> 22:28.819
I can't beat your youth though.

22:30.789 --> 22:31.819
Do you have any children?

22:32.089 --> 22:34.259
I have a daughter. She's in third grade.

22:34.359 --> 22:36.430
I bet she's so pretty if she takes after you.

22:36.660 --> 22:38.230
I can't deny that.

22:39.660 --> 22:42.099
How about I teach her art whenever I have some time?

22:43.329 --> 22:44.339
Are you serious?

22:53.609 --> 22:55.380
You call that a painting? It looks like a cartoon.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.349
I've seen things like that in web comics.

22:57.450 --> 23:00.690
She'll become the most renowned pop artist in Korea in 10 years.

23:00.789 --> 23:01.789
You just watch.

23:03.619 --> 23:05.160
You know we're playing golf tomorrow, right?

23:05.220 --> 23:08.190
Gosh, I hate those guys. Do we have to play golf with them?

23:08.259 --> 23:09.890
Try to get along with them, please.

23:09.960 --> 23:12.430
Do Hyeon's dad helped Father with the site for the factory.

23:12.730 --> 23:16.599
Everything starts from human relationships.

23:17.039 --> 23:19.039
I bet they're no match for me.

23:19.170 --> 23:21.769
What are you saying? Yun Jae's dad is an ex-professional golfer.

23:21.940 --> 23:24.180
You're just a beginner compared to him.

23:24.839 --> 23:27.480
Who is Yun Jae's dad? What does he look like?

23:28.650 --> 23:31.680
- Good shot! - The one who looks like a weasel.

23:31.779 --> 23:32.779
You remember him, right?

23:36.190 --> 23:37.190
What's the score now?

23:37.319 --> 23:38.890
(Jae Seok: 4 Bong Sik: 0 Seong Su: 1 Mun Tak: 1)

23:52.400 --> 23:54.740
Oh, no. It went out of bounds.

24:00.150 --> 24:01.680
Nice, you got par.

24:02.180 --> 24:04.720
It looks like she's been practicing golf day and night.

24:11.490 --> 24:12.519
Bogey for you.

24:13.690 --> 24:17.059
Shall we ask Yun Jae's dad to tutor all of us together?

24:17.160 --> 24:18.859
Women have affairs with their golf instructors.

24:19.829 --> 24:22.069
- Sorry? - What if one of us do that?

24:22.670 --> 24:24.200
Gi Ok, stop joking around.

24:24.670 --> 24:26.710
He makes my heart flutter.

24:26.869 --> 24:28.369
I'd be nice to date a younger guy.

24:29.210 --> 24:30.910
Then, shall we swap husbands?

24:31.210 --> 24:32.980
Hey, I'd obviously love that.

24:34.210 --> 24:35.250
You'll regret it.

24:38.680 --> 24:39.779
What's the matter with her?

24:40.849 --> 24:42.750
- Let's take a short break. - Okay!

24:50.400 --> 24:52.230
I'm so embarrassed.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.039
(Scorecard)

25:03.779 --> 25:04.809
I found it.

25:07.309 --> 25:08.650
Jae Seok, your ball is here.

25:10.519 --> 25:11.779
That's not mine.

25:12.680 --> 25:13.690
It's really not mine.

25:14.589 --> 25:17.259
- The one I hit is a bit different. - How is it different?

25:19.019 --> 25:21.329
I made a mark on it with my fingernail.

25:22.329 --> 25:23.799
Do you know what the 19th hole mean?

25:25.559 --> 25:29.369
It refers to where those in extramarital relationships go...

25:29.529 --> 25:30.740
after the 18th hole.

25:34.440 --> 25:35.740
My goodness.

25:37.079 --> 25:38.779
Raise your hand if you have a secret lover.

25:41.509 --> 25:43.450
Right, who'd actually raise a hand?

25:44.849 --> 25:46.650
You're really something.

25:46.789 --> 25:49.190
Did you actually make your husband get his eyebrows tattooed?

25:49.549 --> 25:51.259
I should prevent it, you know.

25:51.359 --> 25:53.690
If it actually happens, the aftermath will be such a headache.

25:54.130 --> 25:57.500
Right. Your father-in-law used to be a total philanderer, right?

25:57.859 --> 25:59.059
That runs in the blood too.

25:59.230 --> 26:01.230
Don't say that, please. It's so horrendous.

26:02.500 --> 26:04.099
There are two types of men.

26:04.400 --> 26:07.670
Those who cheat on their wives and those who want to cheat.

26:08.710 --> 26:11.980
Ponder on which category your husband may belong.

26:14.579 --> 26:16.450
Hey, is he doing well these days?

26:20.250 --> 26:22.920
The binary species is swarming over here.

26:25.490 --> 26:27.160
We're here.

26:27.329 --> 26:29.160
Gosh, I'm tired. Hello.

26:29.230 --> 26:30.400
Hello.

26:31.660 --> 26:33.829
Shall we have dinner together when we're done?

26:34.170 --> 26:36.740
- Meet me in front of the clubhouse. - Okay.

26:37.670 --> 26:40.240
- Good job. - I'm not hungry though.

26:59.920 --> 27:01.230
It's nice to meet you.

27:01.859 --> 27:03.460
I'm Park Bok Ja.

27:03.730 --> 27:05.230
Thank you in advance for all of your help.

27:05.299 --> 27:07.329
A Jin has a golf get-together today.

27:07.430 --> 27:10.640
I already spoke to her on the phone. I should get to work now.

27:10.900 --> 27:11.940
Wait.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.369
Did you bring a copy of your social security card?

27:14.569 --> 27:15.569
Yes.

27:18.279 --> 27:20.009
I'll give it to Ms. Woo.

27:55.710 --> 27:58.579
Hello, Mr. Chairman. Did you have a good sleep?

28:02.720 --> 28:03.859
Let me help you.

28:05.619 --> 28:06.660
Careful.

28:10.130 --> 28:11.160
Please be careful.

28:11.529 --> 28:13.259
Please try to sit up like this.

28:19.970 --> 28:21.009
Ms. Park.

28:22.309 --> 28:24.279
Did you go into my father-in-law's room already?

28:25.180 --> 28:26.180
Well...

28:26.180 --> 28:27.309
What do you mean?

28:27.480 --> 28:29.480
When Ms. Woo and I were going over my contract together,

28:29.549 --> 28:32.849
we decided that I'll start at 7am today.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.019
It's 10am now.

28:39.460 --> 28:43.130
I'll use Mr. Chairman's bathroom in his room.

28:43.829 --> 28:46.460
To look after him all day...

28:46.559 --> 28:47.670
No, you can't.

28:48.230 --> 28:50.269
There are six bathrooms in this house.

28:50.599 --> 28:51.940
Please use the one upstairs.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.140
Well, ma'am.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.980
I'd like to take excellent care of Mr. Chairman.

28:58.210 --> 29:01.880
If you're too condescending toward me,

29:02.009 --> 29:05.519
I won't be able to look after him wholeheartedly.

29:06.319 --> 29:08.390
Everything is relative, you know.

29:11.589 --> 29:14.890
Do you not care about him sincerely?

29:15.559 --> 29:19.230
You and Ms. Woo are very different.

29:22.400 --> 29:23.400
Ms. Park.

29:24.099 --> 29:26.769
Where is the bathroom upstairs? I'll just use that one.

29:26.839 --> 29:28.309
Don't you understand hierarchy?

29:34.509 --> 29:36.980
Who is above whom in that hierarchy you're speaking of?

29:39.880 --> 29:42.720
I don't really know what I've done to deserve hearing...

29:42.789 --> 29:44.289
such a remark from you.

29:45.019 --> 29:48.589
I have to relieve myself. I need to use the bathroom now.

29:49.890 --> 29:51.630
I guess it's somewhere upstairs.

30:27.069 --> 30:28.430
What is going on?

30:31.470 --> 30:32.940
I'm sorry, sir.

30:34.769 --> 30:35.940
I went upstairs...

30:36.309 --> 30:39.210
to use the bathroom, but ended up...

30:39.940 --> 30:41.950
There's a bathroom inside my room.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.750
Why did you go upstairs and cause this rumpus?

30:44.880 --> 30:46.650
Father, it's actually...

30:46.720 --> 30:49.690
I should use the one upstairs.

30:49.950 --> 30:53.430
Not many people would be nice about those under them...

30:53.529 --> 30:55.029
sharing the same bathroom with them.

30:56.559 --> 30:59.859
I'll use the one upstairs.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.640
I'm sorry about the noise.

31:06.299 --> 31:08.410
Everyone is equal.

31:08.970 --> 31:11.309
And why would you tell her to use the bathroom upstairs...

31:11.380 --> 31:12.839
when there's one on the main floor?

31:13.380 --> 31:14.410
Well, that was...

31:15.109 --> 31:16.650
Age wisely, please.

31:26.319 --> 31:27.329
Oh dear.

31:29.789 --> 31:32.559
Aren't you hungry, Aunt? Why do you always feed me and eat nothing?

31:33.059 --> 31:34.769
I told you that I'm trying to lose weight.

31:35.269 --> 31:37.269
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.700
I forgot that you're on a diet.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.369
The smell filled the whole car. Sorry.

31:44.140 --> 31:46.509
You know that you'll meet your art teacher today, right?

31:46.609 --> 31:48.109
- Yes. - But...

31:48.180 --> 31:51.250
you're taking too many lessons. Your brain might be burnt out soon.

31:51.480 --> 31:53.990
My brain probably looks like this now.

31:55.319 --> 31:57.460
Just tell your mom that you want to cut down.

31:57.660 --> 31:59.460
I'll do my best before I give up.

31:59.859 --> 32:02.490
I just quit ballet, and she already filled my schedule with art lessons.

32:02.730 --> 32:05.000
My schedule is completely full.

32:05.599 --> 32:06.730
What do you hate the most?

32:07.000 --> 32:08.029
Chinese.

32:08.400 --> 32:09.400
Chinese!

32:10.400 --> 32:12.299
You know your grandpa's factory is in China.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.069
Wouldn't that be why you're studying Chinese?

32:14.140 --> 32:15.440
How is that relevant?

32:15.609 --> 32:18.609
Who do you think will inherit the factory? It's obviously you.

32:18.710 --> 32:21.880
There's Dad and Un Gyu. What are you talking about?

32:22.849 --> 32:23.880
That's true.

32:24.180 --> 32:27.019
I guess I've been watching too many American TV series lately.

32:27.849 --> 32:29.549
One of them is...

32:30.089 --> 32:33.529
about a 17-year-old girl inheriting several hundred thousand dollars.

32:33.589 --> 32:35.859
Aunt Jin Hui, I'll tell you a secret.

32:35.990 --> 32:37.730
Do you know what I want to be when I grow up?

32:39.130 --> 32:40.299
A stationery store owner.

32:40.569 --> 32:43.470
Goodness. Your mom will faint if she hears that.

32:43.569 --> 32:46.269
Considering my general aptitude, I think that'd be the best job for me.

32:47.140 --> 32:48.170
Why?

32:48.269 --> 32:51.480
Because all of my customers would be dumb.

32:51.779 --> 32:54.009
I wouldn't need to treat them like royalty.

33:03.490 --> 33:04.859
We're here.

33:05.759 --> 33:08.029
It's on the third floor, Unit 306.

33:08.559 --> 33:09.789
Let's go up together.

33:13.059 --> 33:14.569
- Hello. - Hello.

33:15.299 --> 33:16.630
My gosh, are you Ji Hu?

33:16.740 --> 33:19.240
Hello, I'm Ahn Ji Hu.

33:19.299 --> 33:22.009
Wow, you're so pretty and polite.

33:22.109 --> 33:24.480
Well, what time should I pick her up?

33:24.539 --> 33:26.480
I'll call you when we're done.

33:26.880 --> 33:30.779
By the way, what's your relationship with A Jin?

33:31.480 --> 33:32.480
Well...

33:33.150 --> 33:36.119
I'm just helping her out. I'm like her secretary.

33:36.220 --> 33:37.619
Oh, her secretary?

33:37.720 --> 33:41.230
Yes, you can think of me as her personal assistant...

33:41.289 --> 33:42.630
that manages her day-to-day things.

33:43.529 --> 33:45.230
I didn't know that there was such a thing.

33:45.460 --> 33:48.099
I don't know about that. It's just what the two of us do.

33:48.630 --> 33:50.269
Anyway, please call me when you're done.

33:50.339 --> 33:52.440
Okay, I will. Come in.

33:52.869 --> 33:53.869
See you.

34:04.380 --> 34:05.819
What do you think of Dr. Jang?

34:06.150 --> 34:07.720
- What? - Gosh.

34:08.719 --> 34:11.090
Oh, no. It went out of bounds.

34:11.260 --> 34:13.929
He talks way too much, and all he does is brag about himself.

34:14.130 --> 34:16.090
Most people know that he hires brokers to get...

34:16.159 --> 34:19.599
patients and that all procedures are done by other plastic surgeons.

34:19.800 --> 34:21.730
And that guy, Kim Bong Sik.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.170
Jae Seok, your ball is here.

34:23.440 --> 34:26.099
That dude looks a little dumb.

34:26.500 --> 34:29.639
And that man, Seo Mun Tak. The CEO of the hotel.

34:31.610 --> 34:34.679
He bragged about having a secret girlfriend.

34:34.980 --> 34:37.018
What's he going to do if I tell you?

34:37.320 --> 34:40.750
Right, you shouldn't be telling me.

34:40.849 --> 34:41.849
Why shouldn't I?

34:42.889 --> 34:43.989
It's such scandalous news.

34:46.190 --> 34:48.230
Did Dr. Jang mention anything like that by any chance?

34:48.730 --> 34:51.800
- What do you mean? - Well, like having a girlfriend.

34:51.900 --> 34:55.929
No, he just said that he'll tell me about a stamina-boosting supplement.

34:56.300 --> 34:57.800
That means he has a girlfriend, right?

34:58.000 --> 34:59.869
Why would it mean that?

35:00.739 --> 35:02.510
Why would he take it for his wife?

35:04.280 --> 35:05.739
I'm sorry that I have to say this,

35:06.139 --> 35:08.809
but you're honestly so much like your father.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.019
Gosh, hey. Take back what you just said.

35:11.079 --> 35:13.519
I never take back what I already said. Just forget about it.

35:15.090 --> 35:17.420
That caregiver is starting today, right?

35:18.260 --> 35:19.260
Yes.

35:22.630 --> 35:23.659
Hello?

35:24.099 --> 35:25.630
Yes, today must've been exhausting for you.

35:27.269 --> 35:28.969
Okay, I will. You should hurry home.

35:29.070 --> 35:30.469
You're off tomorrow, so get some rest.

35:31.070 --> 35:33.610
If Ji Hu texts you, just ignore her messages.

35:34.139 --> 35:35.139
All right.

35:36.940 --> 35:38.380
Jin Hui has to hurry home now.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.650
Her brother will bring his fiancée home tomorrow,

35:40.710 --> 35:44.179
but her mom got the date mixed up and haven't even started cooking.

35:45.079 --> 35:46.250
You should pick up Ji Hu.

35:46.480 --> 35:48.849
I need to go to Father's place to sort things out.

35:50.119 --> 35:51.889
- Where am I going? - I told you.

35:51.989 --> 35:53.389
Pick Ji Hu up from her art lesson.

35:53.590 --> 35:54.730
Oh, that web comic artist.

35:55.260 --> 35:59.130
Dear, you better not say anything inappropriate or ignorant.

35:59.230 --> 36:01.730
If you do, you'll end up massively humiliating yourself.

36:02.969 --> 36:05.269
But wouldn't it be better if I go to Dad's place,

36:05.340 --> 36:07.010
and you go there?

36:07.139 --> 36:10.340
No, things must be pretty tense there by now.

36:10.440 --> 36:13.809
I'll sort it out. You'll only make things worse.

36:14.010 --> 36:16.820
Oh, right. Don't forget to pick up Father's hearing aids tomorrow.

36:17.320 --> 36:18.349
All right.

36:24.260 --> 36:25.260
Where's Ms. Park?

36:27.760 --> 36:28.760
Ms. Park!

36:36.429 --> 36:37.800
Yes, sir.

36:38.199 --> 36:39.199
Eat with us.

36:40.510 --> 36:44.280
I'll eat with Ms. Jo later.

36:44.380 --> 36:45.909
Just join us.

36:47.050 --> 36:49.309
- Father. - It's okay, Mr. Chairman.

36:49.980 --> 36:51.849
I'll eat later.

36:53.550 --> 36:56.489
I don't want to feel uneasy when I eat because I won't be able...

36:57.190 --> 36:58.659
to digest the food.

37:03.730 --> 37:06.659
I'll go prepare your bed for you.

37:07.170 --> 37:10.869
By the way, I noticed that your bedsheets are pilling.

37:11.199 --> 37:13.070
I'd like to change them.

37:13.139 --> 37:15.909
I think it's the 100 percent natural bed linen that A Jin bought...

37:15.969 --> 37:17.610
directly from a manufacturer overseas.

37:18.139 --> 37:20.849
All-natural fabrics are more prone to pilling.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.849
It must be very uncomfortable.

37:24.449 --> 37:27.119
I'll buy new sheets tomorrow.

37:27.190 --> 37:29.050
I can just use that one myself.

37:32.389 --> 37:34.130
Hello, Ms. Woo.

37:34.190 --> 37:35.230
I'm sorry, Ms. Park.

37:35.329 --> 37:37.230
I know it's your first day, but I had other plans.

37:37.300 --> 37:40.170
Gosh, please don't worry about it. It's not like I'm a kid.

37:41.030 --> 37:42.469
Everything is going well, right?

37:43.869 --> 37:46.099
I hurt my back a little,

37:46.400 --> 37:48.010
but I think I'll be fine soon.

37:48.110 --> 37:49.440
You hurt your back?

37:50.110 --> 37:51.980
There was a bit of a situation.

37:52.610 --> 37:54.250
I'll talk to you later.

37:54.780 --> 37:56.150
You should have dinner.

37:58.349 --> 38:00.349
Ms. Woo, would you like to have dinner now?

38:00.519 --> 38:01.789
It's okay. I already ate.

38:06.489 --> 38:07.489
Father.

38:07.789 --> 38:08.889
Do you like her?

38:10.929 --> 38:12.329
She's not that good-looking,

38:12.900 --> 38:15.929
but it looks like she has a good personality like you said,

38:16.699 --> 38:18.000
so I'll see how things go.

38:21.710 --> 38:23.880
What about you, Ju Mi? You don't like her?

38:24.110 --> 38:25.539
We can talk about it privately.

38:32.420 --> 38:33.920
Unit 306.

38:42.929 --> 38:45.199
My gosh, are you Ji Hu's dad?

38:47.829 --> 38:49.730
Yes. Hello.

38:50.599 --> 38:51.940
I'm here to pick her up.

38:52.070 --> 38:54.070
It looks like we'll need about 30 more minutes.

38:54.139 --> 38:55.369
Then, I'll wait in the car.

38:55.440 --> 38:57.610
Please come in. You can look at her drawing too.

38:58.079 --> 39:01.550
- No, it's okay. - Jin Hui said that A Jin will come,

39:01.610 --> 39:04.579
so I made some light snacks to eat with her as well.

39:09.090 --> 39:10.190
Okay. Ji Hu.

39:20.599 --> 39:23.230
Ju Mi, you don't like her that much?

39:23.329 --> 39:24.369
A Jin.

39:26.099 --> 39:27.639
I don't think she's right for the job.

39:28.010 --> 39:29.039
Why?

39:29.139 --> 39:31.940
She totally creeps me out.

39:32.079 --> 39:33.409
Is that the only reason?

39:33.480 --> 39:36.949
I have exceptionally good instincts.

39:38.579 --> 39:40.250
Even the day when Jae Gu got himself in trouble,

39:40.449 --> 39:43.420
I got chills down my spine for no reason.

39:44.489 --> 39:46.019
That's exactly how she's making me feel now.

39:46.659 --> 39:47.989
Let's fire her, okay?

39:50.699 --> 39:53.130
If you feel that way, we should. All right.

39:53.230 --> 39:54.570
I'll speak with her tomorrow.

40:22.030 --> 40:23.059
Is it good?

40:23.659 --> 40:26.659
It's so good. This rice cake literally melts in your mouth.

40:27.869 --> 40:30.639
Ji Hu doesn't want to eat it because she had a sandwich on her way here.

40:30.840 --> 40:32.469
She said that rice cake has 300kcal...

40:32.639 --> 40:35.739
and that anything she eats after 7pm makes her put weight on her thighs.

40:41.550 --> 40:43.880
She's very expressive. She gets that from me.

40:45.320 --> 40:46.320
Here.

40:48.889 --> 40:50.090
No, it's here.

40:51.289 --> 40:52.320
I didn't get it?

41:05.170 --> 41:06.170
Hey, Ji Hu.

41:07.710 --> 41:10.739
She learned the basic techniques well. I think she has the talent.

41:10.840 --> 41:13.679
- Oh, really? - Do you like paintings?

41:13.750 --> 41:15.780
- I love paintings. - Who's your favorite painter?

41:16.610 --> 41:18.079
Matisse and Kandinsky.

41:20.590 --> 41:21.619
Who's your favorite?

41:22.389 --> 41:24.289
I'm a fan of Damien Hirst.

41:25.519 --> 41:26.559
- Seriously? - Yes.

41:26.590 --> 41:28.429
He's my third favorite artist.

41:28.630 --> 41:31.030
Matisse, Kandinsky, and Damien Horst.

41:31.429 --> 41:32.429
- Really? - Yes.

41:32.500 --> 41:34.699
My Matisse and Kandinsky...

41:35.429 --> 41:39.570
were making history like that elsewhere,

41:41.639 --> 41:45.309
and this frozen persimmon dessert, which Ms. Jo had worked...

41:48.280 --> 41:50.519
so hard to make became my Matisse...

41:50.849 --> 41:52.949
and Kandinsky of the day.

41:57.860 --> 41:58.889
Goodness.

41:59.659 --> 42:02.429
I can't believe that I'm seeing such incredible work.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.059
You're making me blush.

42:04.230 --> 42:06.030
All I can say is that it's incredible.

42:06.230 --> 42:08.800
Painters have been criticizing pop art, saying that it's not...

42:08.900 --> 42:10.769
a form of pure art.

42:10.900 --> 42:12.300
They often say it's like cartoons.

42:12.800 --> 42:15.539
How ignorant. Cartoons? That's crazy.

42:15.639 --> 42:17.039
I can understand.

42:17.179 --> 42:19.440
Even the illustrator and painter, Norman Rockwell was treated...

42:19.510 --> 42:22.949
like a magazine illustrator in the States at the beginning.

42:23.309 --> 42:27.320
Don't even worry what those art illiterates say.

42:27.690 --> 42:29.820
They think this looks like a cartoon? Unbelievable.

42:29.989 --> 42:31.789
Dad, let's go home already.

42:31.889 --> 42:32.989
All right.

42:35.360 --> 42:36.760
Dad, let's go.

42:37.099 --> 42:40.199
Okay. Hey, isn't your teacher so impressive?

42:40.300 --> 42:41.300
You deserve a thumbs-up.

42:54.579 --> 42:57.449
I remember the calm the day before the storm.

Yun Seong Hui.

43:26.510 --> 43:27.949
(Min Su)

43:31.380 --> 43:34.519
When you hear the sound of thunder at home,

43:34.889 --> 43:38.860
being safe from the possible danger gives you a strange sense of relief.

43:38.920 --> 43:40.860
(Seong Ju)

43:42.960 --> 43:43.960
However,

43:44.960 --> 43:47.900
when you're standing outside without an umbrella, that sound...

43:49.699 --> 43:51.070
gives you fear.

43:54.110 --> 43:56.780
That day, all of us...

43:57.409 --> 43:59.110
were standing outside...

44:00.949 --> 44:02.809
although we were the only ones that didn't know.

44:07.849 --> 44:09.150
(Elementary Level Match Competition)

44:09.219 --> 44:11.920
Life is a repetition of tests where we're required...

44:12.019 --> 44:13.059
to choose the right answers,

44:13.860 --> 44:16.190
but the answer I chose...

44:17.059 --> 44:18.929
was wrong every single time.

44:21.400 --> 44:24.170
I truly hoped that this one would be the right answer.

44:25.170 --> 44:28.909
Henri Matisse. Does that mean his surname is Henri?

44:30.480 --> 44:33.409
Just like how Ji Hu's dad was hoping that Matisse and Kandinsky...

44:33.480 --> 44:35.179
would be the right answer.

44:36.380 --> 44:38.320
- Isn't the result out on 12th? - Yes.

44:38.519 --> 44:40.420
Last year's competition ratio was eight to one.

44:40.650 --> 44:43.019
I know. It keeps on getting more competitive.

44:43.250 --> 44:46.989
They are putting more emphasis on math because there's barely any gap.

44:47.190 --> 44:48.659
A Jin, you must feel at ease.

44:48.760 --> 44:50.760
Math is the subject Ji Hu excels at the most.

44:51.230 --> 44:53.030
You know she's not thorough at all though.

44:53.099 --> 44:55.300
She always gets the easiest questions wrong.

44:55.929 --> 44:56.969
Jeong Hyeon.

44:57.769 --> 44:59.500
I told you to call me by my name.

44:59.900 --> 45:01.440
Why do you keep calling me by my kid's name?

45:01.510 --> 45:02.539
Anyhow,

45:02.769 --> 45:04.880
I want to get Derma Toxin and Restylane Vital injections...

45:04.880 --> 45:06.110
at your husband's clinic.

45:06.309 --> 45:08.809
How about I go with you when you get your Botox?

45:08.880 --> 45:10.320
I got it done three days ago.

45:10.380 --> 45:13.019
I knew it. I was thinking that your smile looked awkward.

45:13.690 --> 45:16.190
Should I get the Beyoncé injection? I heard that it's pretty good.

45:16.250 --> 45:17.889
The Venus injection is better.

45:19.489 --> 45:21.889
You need to get fillers for your nasolabial folds.

45:23.699 --> 45:24.900
Oh, the kids are coming out now.

45:26.159 --> 45:27.670
(Examination Room)

45:27.730 --> 45:29.670
- Mom! - Be careful, guys.

45:29.730 --> 45:31.769
- Hey. - Ji Hu!

45:34.710 --> 45:35.909
A Jin...

45:36.110 --> 45:38.739
I mean, the wife of Daeseong Pulp Chairman's younger son.

45:39.210 --> 45:41.780
How did she meet her husband?

45:42.280 --> 45:43.309
Why do you ask?

45:43.420 --> 45:47.449
I'm just curious as to how he won the heart of such a beautiful lady.

45:48.289 --> 45:51.389
She used to be a flight attendant.

45:51.690 --> 45:54.889
You know those standing signboards you see at travel agencies, right?

45:55.389 --> 45:56.760
She modeled for the company.

45:56.900 --> 46:00.369
Her husband fell in love with her as soon as he saw the signboard,

46:00.730 --> 46:02.699
so he stole it.

46:03.199 --> 46:05.500
My gosh, that's so funny.

46:05.599 --> 46:08.710
I heard that her husband is a bit of a character.

46:14.409 --> 46:15.449
(Ji Hu's Dad)

46:15.550 --> 46:17.920
I'd like to thank you for the delicious rice cake.

46:21.920 --> 46:24.289
- What's this fabric? - It's microfiber.

46:24.360 --> 46:26.119
It's great for blankets.

46:27.760 --> 46:28.789
Hello.

46:30.659 --> 46:33.800
- Let's see. It's 100 dollars. - Yes.

46:52.920 --> 46:54.349
(Friday, August 17)

46:54.449 --> 46:55.690
(Mr. Chairman)

47:01.389 --> 47:03.630
- Hello? - What's taking you so long?

47:04.000 --> 47:06.429
You should've just sent someone. Why did you go there yourself?

47:06.869 --> 47:09.130
This is important. How can I let someone else do it?

47:09.670 --> 47:10.869
Anyway, come back quickly.

47:11.139 --> 47:13.340
I have a kinesiotherapy session today.

47:13.670 --> 47:14.969
You have to come with me.

47:15.170 --> 47:17.039
Yes, of course.

47:19.139 --> 47:20.650
Please wait for me.

47:22.079 --> 47:23.110
Okay.

47:29.489 --> 47:30.519
Excuse me.

47:31.159 --> 47:33.260
- Another serving of pork rinds. - Yes.

47:33.659 --> 47:34.760
A bottle of soju too.

47:38.630 --> 47:40.000
(Dimwit Bong Cheol)

47:41.730 --> 47:42.730
Yes, it's me.

47:43.940 --> 47:46.300
Mr. Chairman has a kinesiotherapy session with you today, right?

47:46.639 --> 47:47.739
Move it to tomorrow.

47:49.639 --> 47:52.079
Just call him and tell him that you need to reschedule it.

47:56.210 --> 47:57.250
Okay.

48:16.300 --> 48:19.469
This is high in collagen,

48:19.539 --> 48:20.869
so it's good for the skin.

48:22.070 --> 48:25.679
You already look much younger than your age though.

48:26.539 --> 48:27.780
You think I look younger?

48:28.210 --> 48:31.849
Gosh, you look at least 10 years younger than your age.

48:33.489 --> 48:34.920
Please get better soon.

48:36.789 --> 48:40.690
You should enjoy everything that young men do.

48:48.030 --> 48:49.699
I've actually been craving this.

48:50.400 --> 48:52.340
Back when I was going through a hard time,

48:52.469 --> 48:54.210
I used to eat this all the time.

48:58.079 --> 49:00.110
He said he's craving pork rinds.

49:00.610 --> 49:01.980
He can never eat it at home...

49:02.079 --> 49:03.719
because his family says it smells up the house.

49:28.710 --> 49:29.809
- Thanks. - Yes.

49:39.420 --> 49:42.719
I'm telling you. She's definitely talented in painting.

49:43.119 --> 49:44.889
Ms. Yun did a lot of it.

49:44.960 --> 49:47.289
She painted two out of 10 petals...

49:47.389 --> 49:49.059
to show me how I should do it.

49:49.130 --> 49:51.530
Anyhow, it looks very promising.

49:55.630 --> 49:57.900
Yes. I should visit Dad before I head to work...

49:58.570 --> 50:00.139
to meet the caregiver.

50:00.210 --> 50:02.539
There's no need because we need to fire her.

50:02.710 --> 50:03.739
Why?

50:03.739 --> 50:06.110
Ju Mi really doesn't like her.

50:06.909 --> 50:08.610
Gosh, I just can't say it to her.

50:08.710 --> 50:11.050
I even arranged a room for her and got her to move her stuff in.

50:11.119 --> 50:12.849
Ju Mi doesn't know her place.

50:12.980 --> 50:14.219
If she remembers what Jae Gu did,

50:14.289 --> 50:16.219
shouldn't she keep her complaints to herself?

50:16.389 --> 50:17.619
That's not right.

50:17.719 --> 50:20.260
Your brother is the one who made that mistake, not her.

50:20.530 --> 50:23.360
How a man behaves depends on how his woman treats him.

50:23.429 --> 50:24.760
She's always so negative.

50:24.929 --> 50:26.699
Maybe that's why Jae Gu ended up like that.

50:28.230 --> 50:30.000
Gosh, I need to go to Father's place now.

50:30.900 --> 50:32.840
Where am I going to find another caregiver?

50:34.670 --> 50:36.340
Let's try to have a good day, everyone!

50:36.510 --> 50:37.840
- Have a good day! - We can do it!

50:39.639 --> 50:41.110
Wow. Good shot!

50:42.510 --> 50:44.480
By the way, shouldn't we have checked...

50:44.550 --> 50:46.820
everyone's pockets before we got started?

50:47.389 --> 50:50.489
He looks totally normal. How could he try to trick us like that?

50:50.820 --> 50:52.289
How embarrassing.

50:52.789 --> 50:55.789
You guys will need to watch what you say in front of him.

50:55.889 --> 50:57.199
He looks like a bigmouth.

50:57.260 --> 50:58.900
He's not my cup of tea.

51:00.300 --> 51:02.130
- Good shot! - Great.

51:02.400 --> 51:04.900
How about we talk honestly since none of us is a bigmouth?

51:05.800 --> 51:07.139
You have another woman, don't you?

51:07.309 --> 51:09.269
Gosh, of course.

51:09.769 --> 51:12.440
What about you? You must have a mistress too.

51:14.179 --> 51:15.579
I don't want to say, "Of course,"

51:16.550 --> 51:17.579
but I do have one too.

51:18.349 --> 51:19.579
Only losers don't have one.

51:19.980 --> 51:22.820
There are two types of outcasts.

51:26.219 --> 51:28.429
Those who don't care as long as they don't know about it,

51:29.460 --> 51:31.900
and those who have to tussle with others to prove themselves.

51:32.030 --> 51:33.030
Ms. Jo.

51:36.940 --> 51:38.000
Ms. Park.

51:39.070 --> 51:40.969
You haven't heard about it from A Jin yet?

51:42.440 --> 51:44.340
What about, ma'am?

51:45.710 --> 51:48.179
I slept like a baby thanks to the new blanket.

51:48.510 --> 51:49.550
Mr. Chairman.

51:50.019 --> 51:51.550
Did you have a good sleep?

51:52.820 --> 51:54.650
Give me breakfast. I want rice.

51:54.820 --> 51:55.820
Yes, sir.

51:57.260 --> 51:58.260
Ms. Jo.

51:59.019 --> 52:00.159
From now on,

52:00.429 --> 52:02.760
I'll prepare Mr. Chairman's meals.

52:03.059 --> 52:04.599
I'll take care of his laundry too.

52:04.699 --> 52:08.429
We should get a new fabric softener with a different scent.

52:09.500 --> 52:11.340
I'll hand-wash his clothes.

52:11.440 --> 52:12.469
Ms. Park!

52:13.000 --> 52:14.239
Hand-washing is a lot of work.

52:20.550 --> 52:23.210
You're a good judge of character...

52:24.179 --> 52:25.820
even though you made a mistake with Jae Seok.

52:31.690 --> 52:34.559
The scope of the things that an outcast can do...

52:34.960 --> 52:36.730
becomes narrow each day.

52:44.139 --> 52:47.739
One of the reasons I became fond of her...

52:48.570 --> 52:52.340
was the fact that she doesn't have the malice...

52:52.840 --> 52:54.849
that I see in most rich people.

53:00.190 --> 53:03.889
The grace that enables her to offer a hand to a devastated outcast.

53:05.659 --> 53:08.960
That was the reason why I thought...

53:09.130 --> 53:10.199
that she was special.

53:23.480 --> 53:27.179
(Faculty of Humanities)

53:34.219 --> 53:36.920
Father, please forgive him just this once.

53:37.190 --> 53:40.260
It was a mistake. Jae-gu is not that kind of person.

53:40.530 --> 53:43.559
I don't want to hear it. I'll disown him as of this moment.

53:46.059 --> 53:48.369
He betrayed me in order to eat up my company.

53:48.500 --> 53:50.570
How dare he kill a person whom I hired?

53:50.739 --> 53:52.269
It means he's capable of killing me as well.

53:52.340 --> 53:55.469
No, Father. Please don't get the wrong idea. It was just an accident.

53:55.570 --> 53:58.679
Anyway, I'll take care of Un Gyu,

53:59.179 --> 54:00.880
but I've already decided to cut ties with Jae Gu.

54:02.880 --> 54:05.179
Let A Jin take care of everything in this household from now on.

54:05.920 --> 54:08.489
I won't give you any financial support.

54:08.550 --> 54:12.059
If I do, my money will obviously go to that punk.

54:12.690 --> 54:14.389
Father...

54:31.210 --> 54:33.780
So? Will you keep that caregiver?

54:34.010 --> 54:35.110
I should. What else can I do?

54:40.989 --> 54:42.219
She's Pungsan CEO's mistress.

54:42.489 --> 54:45.659
She's gorgeous. Why is she living as a mistress, not as his wife?

54:47.559 --> 54:48.929
I can understand men.

54:49.090 --> 54:52.500
Even I'd want to be with young, fresh-faced women like her.

54:54.570 --> 54:56.900
Gi Ok, I bought 10kg of cherries yesterday.

54:56.969 --> 54:58.000
Do you want some?

54:58.070 --> 54:59.639
It's okay. I still have some too.

55:10.980 --> 55:12.250
Hello, delivery for you.

55:12.719 --> 55:14.750
- Okay. - Enjoy your food.

55:49.550 --> 55:52.360
I wasn't able to find a tart that's as sweet...

55:52.760 --> 55:54.530
as your smile.

55:55.530 --> 55:56.630
From Ahn Jae Seok.

56:02.630 --> 56:04.070
Pork belly and soju.

56:04.670 --> 56:05.900
Fried chicken and beer.

56:06.639 --> 56:07.969
Burger and cola.

56:09.409 --> 56:12.809
Every kind of food that exists has the most ideal pairing.

56:20.119 --> 56:23.289
And there's one thing that beats the pleasure...

56:23.360 --> 56:26.289
given by the sweetest food in the whole world.

56:55.190 --> 56:56.190
It's sweet, isn't it?

56:57.059 --> 56:58.119
It's really sweet.

56:58.659 --> 56:59.989
I couldn't resist it.

Hello, Ms. Baek.

57:34.590 --> 57:35.630
Hey, A Jin.

57:35.829 --> 57:39.300
There's good news and better news. Which one do you want to hear first?

57:40.469 --> 57:41.500
Good news.

57:41.800 --> 57:44.500
I heard that a hot guy will come to our meditation class tomorrow.

57:45.039 --> 57:46.199
We can all pair up now.

57:46.570 --> 57:49.539
That's great. Now, I want to hear the better news.

57:51.239 --> 57:54.849
Ji Hu is the only 1 who got a 100 percent...

57:55.210 --> 57:56.980
on the math competition.

57:59.420 --> 58:00.449
Really?

58:01.050 --> 58:02.119
Really?

58:04.119 --> 58:06.789
Ms. Baek, you're being serious, right? My goodness.

58:07.260 --> 58:10.199
The association that organized it wants to take a picture of you.

58:10.500 --> 58:11.699
I can say yes to them, right?

58:11.929 --> 58:12.929
Ms. Baek.

58:14.469 --> 58:17.369
I'm really happy right now.

58:20.639 --> 58:21.969
I'm too excited at the moment.

58:22.940 --> 58:24.539
I'll call you again in a bit.

58:25.610 --> 58:26.639
Okay.

58:28.750 --> 58:30.750
The sweetness she was thoroughly enjoying at that moment...

58:31.079 --> 58:33.389
could've been a gift from the sky.

58:33.750 --> 58:35.949
But the conclusion I've come to...

58:36.760 --> 58:39.820
is the fact that such a gift is bestowed on us...

58:39.920 --> 58:42.489
before extreme pain and suffering.

58:44.429 --> 58:48.000
It can be so mean at times.

59:11.219 --> 59:12.789
Know your place, Park Bok Ja.

59:12.860 --> 59:15.730
You're just a maid here. My father-in-law's caregiver.

59:15.789 --> 59:16.800
I have to fire her.

59:17.159 --> 59:20.030
I have no choice because Ju-mi absolutely can't stand her.

59:20.130 --> 59:23.539
A Jin is more simple-minded than you think. I bet she has no idea.

59:23.639 --> 59:26.369
I'll make sure she never finds out. Just trust me.

59:26.469 --> 59:29.110
We have a new member who is joining us starting today.

59:29.210 --> 59:31.409
- He's Lawyer Kang Gi Ho. - She's pretty.

59:31.539 --> 59:34.010
- Father, she is... - Sir.

59:34.380 --> 59:35.849
Please do as Ju Mi says.

59:35.949 --> 59:37.750
She is the lady of our household.

59:37.849 --> 59:39.320
Even I don't own a high-end designer purse.

59:39.420 --> 59:41.420
Why should a caregiver have one?

59:41.619 --> 59:42.849
Don't...

59:43.590 --> 59:44.820
provoke me, please.

59:44.920 --> 59:47.590
You'll get kicked out if you don't behave yourself.
