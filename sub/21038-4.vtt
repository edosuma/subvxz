WEBVTT

00:56.120 --> 00:57.781
(Gaspiflg)

00:59.560 --> 01:01.505
(Shivering)

01:04.280 --> 01:05.907
(Children crying)

01:06.080 --> 01:07.627
MAN: The grain ship's in!

01:07.800 --> 01:10.143
It's in! The grain ship's in. Make haste!

01:18.440 --> 01:21.386
The Princess Charlotte was ambushed
this morning at Truro quay.

01:21.560 --> 01:22.879
- Was she carrying corn?
- Mm.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.259
Then of course she was ambushed.
What else could starving people do?

01:26.440 --> 01:29.944
You have been found guilty
of riot and theft,

01:30.120 --> 01:32.224
crimes for which there can be no justification.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.743
ROSS: The grain stores
have been empty for months.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.547
Failed harvest, worst winter in 30 years.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.779
7'0 summon up a vicious mob,

01:38.960 --> 01:42.259
to seize without compunction
the property of your betters.

01:42.440 --> 01:45.864
This demonstrates a contempt for the law
which cannot go unpunished.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.860
(Gunshots)

01:48.040 --> 01:50.600
How else are poor folks
to get food in their bellies?

01:50.760 --> 01:52.341
No doubt they paid dearly for it.

01:52.520 --> 01:53.908
20 dead.

01:54.080 --> 01:58.028
Some shot,
others trampled underfoot in the panic.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.820
- Is the Princess Charlotte a Warleggan ship?
- She is.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.786
Then those who survived will also pay.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.019
I am committing you for trial at the next assizes

02:06.200 --> 02:09.658
with recommendation that you be sentenced
to 15 years' transportation.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.343
- That's not fair.
- (Clamour of protests)

02:25.760 --> 02:27.227
SOLDIER: Move along!

02:44.760 --> 02:46.978
(Cries out)

02:47.760 --> 02:48.863
Prudie!

02:52.760 --> 02:55.342
- Run and make sure all's ready.
- I don't like it, maid.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.659
'T'ain't sense, 't'ain't clever, 't'ain't wise.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.422
'Tis more than wise to avoid
the faddlings of Dr Choake!

03:00.600 --> 03:02.943
Without Dwight,
Ross won't hear of me birthin' alone.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.224
But what he don't know, can't hurt him!

03:05.400 --> 03:07.140
(Grunts)

03:07.320 --> 03:09.663
(Breathes deeply)

03:10.840 --> 03:12.023
Run!

03:15.360 --> 03:19.467
Do George Warleggan not see the connection
between failed harvests and folk rioting?

03:19.640 --> 03:22.746
ROSS: And his decision to hoard grain?
Clearly not.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.025
I give you Wheal Leisure.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.383
Once a Poldark mine, built on Poldark land.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.982
Begun with high hopes
and the naive aim of giving work

03:33.160 --> 03:35.902
and decent living conditions
to local men and women.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.457
Now in the hands of a man without conscience.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.063
For whom workers are chaff and profit is God.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.027
'Twas a noble aim, Ross.
'Twas a worthy enterprise.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.179
I wonder if he thinks so.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.303
What did he die of? Starvation?

03:51.080 --> 03:52.820
Pneumonia.

03:53.680 --> 03:57.787
I'm told he'd been fading for weeks
but declined to stay home and rest.

03:57.960 --> 04:00.383
He has only himself to blame.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.539
It would appear so.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.107
This was a good mine
before you got your hands on her, George.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.226
My dear Ross,
this was only ever an average mine.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.265
Oh, the famous red copper?

04:12.440 --> 04:15.420
The precious commodity
which made her such a rarity?

04:15.600 --> 04:16.817
It's finished.

04:18.560 --> 04:23.179
Oh, there are other lodes, far less rich,
far less profitable.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.949
Yet I see why you're so attached to her.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.979
You're kindred spirits.

04:30.760 --> 04:34.457
_ Both full of noise
but ultimately lacking In substance.

04:36.920 --> 04:40.026
Go on, Ross. Tell me to get off your land.
Oh, wait, you can't.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.180
Because the land we're standing on
belongs to the mine.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.863
And the mine belongs to me.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.137
How do you sleep at night, George?

04:51.480 --> 04:53.505
Perhaps you should ask Elizabeth.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.943
Ross, shall we?

05:15.480 --> 05:17.220
(Clicks tongue)

05:24.320 --> 05:25.423
Demelza?

05:33.440 --> 05:35.101
Demelza?

05:38.080 --> 05:41.345
Oh, Cap'n Ross, Mistress Demelza say
can 'ee fetch her up a dish 0' soup?

05:41.520 --> 05:43.499
- Surely that's your...
- (Door closes)

05:47.960 --> 05:52.420
Thank you kindly, my man.
Just set it down over there.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.680
- Are you unwell?
- Never better.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.543
Can I do anything else for your Ladyship?

06:01.720 --> 06:04.359
Well, you could say good day to your daughter.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.465
Miss Clowance Poldark.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.508
Where was Dr Choake?

06:28.680 --> 06:31.262
Ah, 'twas all over afore we could send for him.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.140
(Baby crying)

06:47.800 --> 06:49.017
Why is he so fretful?

06:49.200 --> 06:51.100
Dr Choake says it's wilfulness.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.919
He thinks we should put our foot down.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.867
Martha. See he's kept warm and quiet.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.382
Yes, ma'am.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.385
I'm going to Lady Randolph's for tea.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.585
Do you dine at home this evening?

07:08.760 --> 07:12.184
At the Trevelyans'.
And then to the Carricks' for cards.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.059
Invitations come thick and fast.

07:16.280 --> 07:18.464
Though not from the Godolphins.

07:18.640 --> 07:21.382
Despite your letting young Anthony
off the hook in court.

07:21.560 --> 07:24.347
These ancient families require persistence.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.227
But Christmas is coming.
The perfect excuse for a ball.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.346
- To which the Godolphins will be invited.
- But will they accept?

07:34.840 --> 07:38.264
I must go. I'm expected at a Wheal Leisure
shareholders meeting.

07:38.440 --> 07:42.183
Sadly, without the presence of Ross Poldark
to amuse me.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.507
How I miss the days
when I had him at my mercy.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.499
Drake! You came.

08:11.680 --> 08:14.581
What's in your basket? Toads!

08:14.760 --> 08:17.467
- You said your aunt loved a toad.
- (Laughs)

08:20.960 --> 08:23.702
I've a gift for 'ee too, Miss Morwenna.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.865
Winter primroses!

08:28.040 --> 08:29.428
Where did you find them?

08:29.600 --> 08:34.617
That's for me to know, but if 'ee ever wish for
more, I'll comb the earth in search of 'em.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.267
Come on.

08:39.320 --> 08:42.665
Aunt Agatha, Drake's here!
With a surprise.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.778
Uncle George hates toads
and had them all cleared from our pond.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.307
Imagine if they ever came back.

08:53.320 --> 08:57.017
Geoffrey Charles, I'm not sure
your Uncle George would approve...

08:57.200 --> 09:00.419
- Of the toad?
- Of our guest.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.941
Aunt Agatha won't tell him. Will you, Aunt?

09:06.840 --> 09:11.618
Did you know Geoffrey Charles's friend
is related to my nephew?

09:14.800 --> 09:20.579
Of course you do. For Geoffrey
Charles's friend tells you a great deal.

09:23.120 --> 09:29.980
Tell my nephew his aunt
is much aggrieved at his neglect!

09:34.960 --> 09:39.624
I have a letter from our_ celebrated Member
of Parliament, Unwnn Trevaunance.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.869
Whom you jilted.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.144
I may have encouraged him
to think he had another chance.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.389
In return for?

09:44.560 --> 09:46.744
- Information on a certain naval officer.
- And?

09:46.920 --> 09:50.424
According to this letter, he's brought his
influence to bear at the Admiralty.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.262
- They have everything in hand.
- Have they?

09:53.440 --> 09:56.944
Our people are speaking to theirs
and shortly all the officers will be released.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.224
- In time for Christmas?
- Or shortly after.

09:59.400 --> 10:03.222
- So Unwin has his_ uses after all!
- (Baby grizzles)

10:10.280 --> 10:12.066
(Moaning)

10:16.280 --> 10:18.259
(Whimpering)

10:20.360 --> 10:21.679
Argh!

10:25.960 --> 10:27.939
(Moaning and coughing)

10:41.040 --> 10:43.019
(Whimpering and moaning)

10:45.680 --> 10:47.944
- A letter for you, miss.
- Thank you.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.621
Oh.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.303
Geoffrey Charles and I
are to go to Truro for Christmas.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.266
GEOFFREY CHARLES: To Uncle George's?

11:02.440 --> 11:05.102
The carriage will come for us on Saturday.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.819
How long will 'ee be gone?

11:08.840 --> 11:12.059
A few weeks...maybe more.

11:16.160 --> 11:19.266
I'd come to bid 'ee goodbye,
but I must be at the christening.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.959
'Tis my sister's child, Clowance.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.479
Your cousin, Master Geoffrey.

11:25.640 --> 11:27.949
If we're away for Christmas,
I must give you your present now.

11:28.120 --> 11:31.339
- Oh, there's no need.
- Oh, there is. Wait there.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.588
I've nothing to give you.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.227
You gave me this.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.823
It's the most precious gift I've ever received.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.104
You'll never take it off?

11:48.200 --> 11:50.179
I never will.

12:03.440 --> 12:06.898
Here you are, Drake.
So you can write to me when I'm away.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.344
Oh, thank you, Master Geoffrey.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.307
Your cheeks are flushed, Wenna.
Have you a fever?

12:26.160 --> 12:27.661
Be that the light of God in your eyes?

12:27.840 --> 12:31.264
Maybe not entire,
but 'tis sacred to me nonetheless.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.000
But is she worth the risk of your mortal soul?

12:35.400 --> 12:36.788
Reckon so!

12:50.680 --> 12:52.102
Is that wise?

12:52.280 --> 12:54.180
I have neglected her of late.

12:54.360 --> 12:57.102
You swore you'd keep your distance
from all things Trenwith.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.942
Agatha is not "all things Trenwith".

13:01.280 --> 13:04.260
She's a Poldark. And my aunt.

13:04.440 --> 13:08.945
George has brought Leisure to its knees.
I'll be damned if he'll do the same to Agatha.

13:10.680 --> 13:13.786
Why shouldn't she come
to my daughter's christening?

13:17.320 --> 13:19.299
(Hammering at door)

13:22.400 --> 13:24.140
(Door opens)

13:53.480 --> 13:54.981
(Bell tolls)

14:10.640 --> 14:13.200
I've sent the carriage for Morwenna
and Geoffrey Charles,

14:13.360 --> 14:15.146
as you requested.

14:19.480 --> 14:20.663
Geoffrey Charles! Wait...

14:20.840 --> 14:22.159
You needn't come.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.663
- I don't think either of us should.
- I'm going, Wenna.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.546
No one needs to know.

14:27.680 --> 14:31.707
We thank you, Almighty God,
for the gift of water.

14:32.880 --> 14:36.065
Over it the Holy Spirit moved
in the beginning of creation.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.060
My husband is here in spirit.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.299
And is godfather in absentia.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.745
- In these times of dire poverty and starvation...
- (Door opens)

14:45.560 --> 14:50.702
...remind us how you led the children of Israel
out of their bondage in Egypt...

14:52.640 --> 14:54.346
...into the land of plenty.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.480
How your son, Jesus,
received the baptism of John

14:58.640 --> 15:01.097
and was anointed by the Holy Spirit
as the Messiah.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.420
Christ did lead us through the toils
and tribulations of this earth,

15:05.600 --> 15:10.424
from the bondage of suffering
into everlasting life.

15:11.440 --> 15:14.341
- I hope you'll forgive our intrusion.
- It's no intrusion.

15:14.520 --> 15:18.547
- Will you join our celebrations at Nampara?
- Oh, well...

15:18.720 --> 15:21.029
- Oh, Wenna, let's!
- Don't think we can.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.340
We're leaving for Truro.
Indeed, we're already late.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.181
But maybe just for half an hour?

15:30.240 --> 15:34.119
I fear we cannot.
Much as I would like to.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.339
- (Sighs)
- You'll spend Christmas in Truro?

15:36.520 --> 15:39.307
More's the pity!
Uncle George is no Saint Nicholas.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.903
And poor Aunt Agatha will be left all alone.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.344
-Indeed.
- My brother is a gentle soul.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.739
And has a kind of goodness,
the like of which I've never known.

15:48.760 --> 15:52.309
And were he of your station,
I'd wish for nothing more.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.027
But he's far beneath it...
cannot aspire to It.

15:59.240 --> 16:00.787
You know it.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.101
I know it.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.540
'Tis well you're going away.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.901
T'will break the bond.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.059
So I tell myself.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.939
Goodbye, Morwenna.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.119
Come, Geoffrey Charles, we're very late.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.547
My hat. I left it on the seat.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.699
I'll go.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.105
- I'll come and visit.
- No.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.259
This must stop.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.944
Can 'ee stop?

16:55.080 --> 16:56.980
Yes.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.377
HENSHAWE: Cheery little thing.
DEMELZA: Sometimes.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.199
- How has she been?
- Just fine.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.065
Did 'ee hear about the goin's in St Ann's?

17:23.240 --> 17:26.824
Another corn ship raided,
two young tackers shot.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.584
Unwin assures me it's only a matter of time
before Dr Enys will be released

17:30.760 --> 17:33.706
and in the meantime he receives
the best possible treatment.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.708
(Groaning)

17:52.000 --> 17:54.821
Did I not order you to rest, Lieutenant Armitage?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.025
And who will order you to rest?

17:58.480 --> 18:00.345
If any dared, I wouldn't heed them.

18:01.280 --> 18:05.023
Then may I watch and...
try and learn something useful?

18:22.920 --> 18:24.547
DEMELZ4: 775 good news of Dwight.

18:24.720 --> 18:28.668
If it's true.
You forget, I've been a prisoner of war myself.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.182
But Dwight's a doctor.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.500
- Will he not get special privileges?
- Let's hope so.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.869
I intend to open my house to all emigre nobles
fleeing that wicked regime.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.940
It's the least I can do.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.860
She hates to feel useless.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.827
I know the feeling.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.381
What is it?
Do you not like my gown?

19:15.640 --> 19:17.619
Your gown is exquisite.

19:18.920 --> 19:22.105
But I cannot permit you to dance tonight...

19:24.080 --> 19:26.184
...with anyone but I.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.665
ROSS: Geoffrey Charles has some spirit.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.425
I'm impressed he disobeyed his governess.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.299
Which reminds me, Aunt Agatha never replied.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.186
Per'aps she never received the note.

19:52.360 --> 19:55.022
There's only one thing for it.
I shall go and fetch her myself.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.987
They'll never admit you. They'll likely shoot you!

19:58.160 --> 19:59.741
Not if I'm with him.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.537
We shan't be long.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.986
Mama.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.879
You're very late.
Go up and change before the guests arrive.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.826
- Guests?
- For the ball.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.901
- Oh, but...
- I've ordered a new dress for you. Make haste.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.139
(Knocks at door)

20:38.960 --> 20:40.177
Your pardon, sir.

20:40.360 --> 20:42.180
Captain Poldark is here to visit his aunt.

20:42.360 --> 20:45.261
A glass of canary and a blazing fire,
if you please.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.384
Of course I never had your invitation!

20:48.560 --> 20:51.984
Do you think I'd miss a chance
to drink port and eat heavy cake?

20:52.160 --> 20:55.584
- This room is like ice.
- The maids don't make me a fire.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.899
So that's George's plan.

20:58.080 --> 21:00.583
To kill you with cold and infection.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.979
- (Scoffs)
- Come and live with me at Nampara.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.822
And lose the chance to torment him?

21:07.000 --> 21:10.504
Bah! I was born in this house,
I'll die in this house!

21:11.680 --> 21:14.740
And if it costs me cake and a few hot coals...

21:14.920 --> 21:19.698
What must Geoffrey Charles think,
seeing that gamecock strut about his home?

21:19.880 --> 21:21.620
And Valentine.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.140
I feel sorry for any child, having that as a father.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.345
(String quarter playing)

21:33.520 --> 21:35.499
(Low chatter)

21:51.600 --> 21:55.377
No Godolphins, no Boscowans, no Bassets.

21:55.560 --> 21:58.745
It's snowing.
They'll be anxious about the journey home.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.024
Very eye-catching.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.749
Always was.
No wonder Francis never let her out of his sight.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.706
I meant the cousin.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.700
Morvvenna, I'm bored!

22:09.680 --> 22:11.341
I wish we were at Uncle Ross's party.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.704
We should not even have been
at the christening.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.337
I'm sorry I allowed myself to be persuaded.

22:16.520 --> 22:20.263
_ I'm not.
I'd lIke to know my cousnn Clowance better.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.982
I'd wager she's less dull than Valentine!
(Chuckles)

22:27.880 --> 22:31.759
First thing tomorrow, I'll write to Harrow.
I want that brat out of my house.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.700
- How was she?
- As expected.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.783
Your task is to look after my aunt, is it not?

22:45.960 --> 22:48.747
- Aye, sir.
- Then you've failed miserably.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.945
I'll be making regular visits from now on,

22:51.120 --> 22:55.307
and if you fail to ensure her comfort,
I'll have you dismissed.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.101
(Door opens)

23:03.360 --> 23:05.066
Did Morvvenna enjoy the christening?

23:05.240 --> 23:06.821
Christening?

23:07.000 --> 23:08.547
Oh, did she neglect to mention?

23:08.720 --> 23:10.984
Her and Geoffrey Charles
were at Sawle church today

23:11.160 --> 23:13.947
where the latest Poldark brat was baptised.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.219
Clowance, I believe they named her.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.220
Ross and Demelza have a daughter?

23:21.880 --> 23:23.939
Let's hope they're less careless with this one.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.099
But how could Geoffrey Charles...

23:28.480 --> 23:30.903
He cannot be blamed.
It must be Morvvenna who...

23:31.080 --> 23:34.345
She must be reprimanded...punished.

23:34.520 --> 23:35.987
Oh, she will be.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.223
Ah. My dear Mr Whitworth.

23:46.440 --> 23:50.900
I was so sorry to hear of your wife's death.
How are your two little girls?

23:51.080 --> 23:52.581
As well as can be expected, ma'am.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.546
It's only been a week.

23:54.720 --> 23:58.542
Only your kind invitation could have forced me
to leave the house today.

23:58.720 --> 24:00.824
Life must go on.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.377
My very thought when I chose this waistcoat.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.187
(Giggles)

24:12.640 --> 24:14.505
Ff veno's o’ yours, tnen, Cap’n?

24:14.680 --> 24:17.240
Caught robbin' another Warleggan grain ship.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.982
Look pretty with their necks in a noose!

24:22.640 --> 24:24.221
What can I say?

24:24.400 --> 24:27.221
He's within his rights
to protect Warleggan property.

24:28.280 --> 24:31.386
Is George not aware the harvest failed,
no corn to be had anywhere?

24:31.560 --> 24:33.141
Of course he's aware.

24:33.320 --> 24:36.141
Which is why he imports, hoards
and sells to the highest bidder.

24:36.320 --> 24:40.302
Riot and theft will not help these people.
So what will?

24:42.720 --> 24:44.267
Say nothing of her misdemeanour.

24:44.440 --> 24:47.079
- But surely...
- There may be a better solution.

24:47.240 --> 24:51.586
She's not an ill-looking girl. She must surely
hope to be more than just a governess.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.022
Eventually, yes, but...

24:53.200 --> 24:55.839
When Geoffrey Charles goes to school,
what does her future hold?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.582
I know it would please you
to have her well-matched.

24:59.640 --> 25:03.667
And it could be advantageous to us,
depending on the candidate.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.978
A highly respected young man.

25:09.960 --> 25:12.986
And his mother is a Godolphin.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.059
(Clears throat)

25:19.840 --> 25:21.705
My dear, have you been introduced?

25:21.880 --> 25:23.745
Our cousin, Miss Chynoweth.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.138
The Reverend Osborne Whitworth.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.497
Shall we assay the gavotte, Miss Chynoweth?

25:31.480 --> 25:35.621
Oh, I hope you'll excuse me, sir.
I'm not fond of dancing.

25:36.920 --> 25:40.549
That can only be because your partners
thus far have lacked expertise.

25:41.560 --> 25:44.347
Allow a master to initiate you in the pleasures.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.465
(Birdsong)

26:05.600 --> 26:08.979
God bless the master of this house

26:09.160 --> 26:11.378
The mistress also

26:11.560 --> 26:16.827
And all the little children around the table go

26:17.560 --> 26:19.824
And all your kin and kinsmen

26:20.000 --> 26:22.025
That dwell both far and near

26:22.200 --> 26:26.978
We wish a Merry Christmas,
a Happy New Year

26:28.640 --> 26:29.857
That looks good, doesn't it?

26:30.040 --> 26:32.019
How very blessed we are.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.760
I wonder how Dwight will keep Christmas
this year?

26:53.360 --> 26:55.339
Easy now, Williams.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.865
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

27:02.040 --> 27:04.258
God's grace be with you.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.907
Move it!

27:07.480 --> 27:09.459
(Children crying)

27:10.360 --> 27:13.989
- Here.
- Starvation breeds desperate men.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.344
I never knew it this bad.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.897
'Tis like they could tear us to pieces
and eat us alive.

27:19.080 --> 27:23.346
Humanity have brought this on itself.
Have sinned and must pay the price.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.385
What sin?

27:25.560 --> 27:29.587
Let all examine their consciences
to check they are without blemish.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.500
Mine is.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.544
On account ofI don't consider love to be a sin.

27:42.120 --> 27:45.146
Oh, Ross, what can be done for these people?

27:46.400 --> 27:50.427
So that's my proposal.
We cannot feed all Cornwall.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.943
So we must keep this plan to ourselves.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.461
I admit it's risky.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.949
It requires each and every one of us
to play our part

27:58.120 --> 27:59.621
and it may fall at the first hurdle.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.984
- But unless we do something...
- I'm with you.

28:02.160 --> 28:04.105
We all are.

28:04.280 --> 28:06.145
Where do we start?

28:06.320 --> 28:08.538
With an old friend.

28:08.720 --> 28:13.840
May an old friend speak plainly?
You're out 0' your mind!

28:14.000 --> 28:16.264
(Laughs) That's promising.

28:16.440 --> 28:20.627
Even if supplies were easy to come by,
which in times of war, they're not,

28:20.800 --> 28:25.999
even if we could get 'em across the
Channel unscathed and land 'em unseen

28:26.160 --> 28:30.904
with no guarantee of a delivery date,
the cost would be...

28:31.080 --> 28:36.507
Prohibitive? I realise that.
But money will be found.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.344
- Are you sure?
- You have my word.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.427
(Bell tolling)

28:44.600 --> 28:46.465
(Groaning and coughing)

28:50.720 --> 28:52.699
Enys?

28:55.680 --> 28:57.659
Enys?

29:00.040 --> 29:02.019
I'm here, Williams.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.305
What is it, my friend?

29:05.480 --> 29:10.019
Wat... Water, please. Water...

29:54.480 --> 29:56.107
ROSS: This will do very well.

29:56.280 --> 30:00.182
SAM: Yet it sit not easy with I
that a house of God be used as a cache.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.669
Nevertheless, it will be so used.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.659
It's the last place anyone will look.

30:07.360 --> 30:09.339
I like not your way of doin', brother.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.617
Get used to it, brother.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.542
CAROLINE:
What would Dwight make of us now?

30:20.720 --> 30:22.585
- Do we look the part?
- Of highwaymen?

30:22.760 --> 30:26.105
Is it not our mission to part as many men
from their guineas as possible?

30:32.120 --> 30:36.227
Good day to you, sir. A fine morning
to address the business of matrimony.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.840
As to the matter of a settlement
for Miss Chynowetn,

30:53.000 --> 30:54.865
I've been thinking of 2,000.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.177
Ah.

30:57.240 --> 31:03.099
My dear sir, you'll pardon me, but a man in my
position must look the part, dress the part,

31:03.280 --> 31:06.579
carry himself in such a way as to inspire awe.

31:06.760 --> 31:10.537
- Must he?
- Besides which, with debts of over 1 ,000,

31:10.720 --> 31:16.784
I could not in all countenance accept
a penny less than 6,000...guineas.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.579
Put simply, Sir John, our mission is this:

31:19.760 --> 31:22.467
to raise enough funds
to help the poor hereabouts

31:22.640 --> 31:24.540
survive the worst winter in living memory.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.347
My mother is a Godolphin.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.624
And Morwenna is a Chynoweth.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.665
One of the oldest families in the county.

31:30.840 --> 31:31.943
Daughter of a dean.

31:32.120 --> 31:35.783
Devout, healthy, particularly fond
of motherless children.

31:35.960 --> 31:40.738
But if you feel there is another
pretty young lady with 2,000,

31:40.920 --> 31:47.462
willing to yoke herself to a penniless clergyman,
you are, of course, at liberty to seek her out.

31:47.640 --> 31:50.507
Our own households have begun
by pledging 50 guineas apiece.

31:50.680 --> 31:53.501
I've also made a large donation
in my late uncle's name.

31:53.680 --> 31:56.865
And we'd feel sure you'll not be wanting
in your own generosity.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.739
Far be it from we, Sir Philip, to tell a body
how much he should pledge.

32:22.920 --> 32:27.380
But perhaps we could mention that
Sir John has just offered 20 guineas.

32:33.600 --> 32:36.819
My dear, you do him wrong.
I believe he offered 25.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.824
I could be prevailed upon to accept 4,000.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.379
In times of economic hardship,
it would be irresponsible of us

32:45.560 --> 32:48.586
to increase the offer beyond 2,000.

32:48.760 --> 32:52.184
As I was sayin' to Miss Penvenen,
you'll not find a kindlier man than Sir Hugh.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.920
He is generosity itself!

32:55.080 --> 32:57.640
It would be impossible to exist
on so paltry a sum!

32:57.800 --> 33:03.340
Doubtless God will then guide your steps
towards some amiable young heiress.

33:07.640 --> 33:09.221
Shall I put you down for 30 guineas?

33:22.320 --> 33:25.460
Taking into consideration the many blessings

33:25.640 --> 33:29.337
I would gain in the actual personage
of Miss Chynoweth...

33:30.360 --> 33:34.137
...I believe I'd be willing to accept 3,500.

33:34.320 --> 33:37.460
Good God, man,
do you imagine I have money to burn?

33:54.000 --> 33:55.581
GEORGE: ﬁnal/)4 a deai/

33:55.760 --> 34:00.584
To be related to the Godolphins, I was willing
to go higher, but the idiot settled for 3,000.

34:00.760 --> 34:02.466
(Chuckles)

34:02.640 --> 34:04.858
Now all that remains
is for you to inform the bride.

34:05.040 --> 34:06.064
Oh.

34:06.240 --> 34:09.346
But surely, as you are the one
who has made all the arrangements...

34:09.520 --> 34:14.059
I would not for the world deprive you
of this happy task, my dear.

34:21.080 --> 34:23.059
- May I help you?
- Morvvenna?

34:43.800 --> 34:45.347
Marry...

34:45.520 --> 34:47.021
Mr Whitworth?

34:47.200 --> 34:49.987
Well, I need hardly enumerate
to the advantages of the match.

34:50.160 --> 34:52.902
(Sighs) The excellent prospects of the groom.

34:53.080 --> 34:57.187
Your immediate transformation
from governess to lady of the town.

34:57.920 --> 35:01.026
The help it will be to your widowed mother
and younger sisters.

35:01.200 --> 35:04.658
Mr Warleggan's generosity
in providing the settlement.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.307
(Sobs quietly)

35:06.480 --> 35:08.220
Do our kind thoughts displease you?

35:09.240 --> 35:11.697
Does Mr Whitworth's love mean nothing at all?

35:11.880 --> 35:13.461
I do not know Mr Whitworth.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.383
We have barely exchanged three sentences.

35:17.560 --> 35:20.222
He knows enough to wish to make you his wife.

35:20.400 --> 35:22.664
- As I told your mother...
- You've written to her?

35:22.840 --> 35:27.345
Emphasising the excellence of the match,
the goodness and piety of the groom.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.181
I'm sure she'll be delighted.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.339
She would be if she thought I loved him!

35:33.520 --> 35:34.987
But I do not.

35:36.840 --> 35:39.946
I think, though your mother
would wish you to be happy,

35:40.120 --> 35:44.022
she'd be dismayed to think of you
finding fault with a match

35:44.200 --> 35:48.546
because of some false, romantic notion
of what marriage should be.

35:48.720 --> 35:51.097
Is it wrong to hope for love in a marriage?

35:53.760 --> 35:56.547
When you wed Francis,
did you not marry for love?

35:59.360 --> 36:01.624
I married for what I thought was love.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.199
The illusion lasted barely a year.

36:06.240 --> 36:11.360
My marriage to Mr Warleggan was not founded
on romance, yet it is altogether more successful.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.664
From Caroline Penvenen,
begging 30 guineas to help the poor.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.864
You lately spent 3,000 on a dowry.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.600
Will another 30 bankrupt you?

36:47.040 --> 36:49.417
I daresay she expects a refusal.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.699
Then I shall disappoint her.

36:59.880 --> 37:04.260
From George Warleggan...50 guineas.

37:04.440 --> 37:05.509
I know his game!

37:05.680 --> 37:09.309
'Tis not compassion for the poor. It is so
his name's at top 0' the list 0' benefactors.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.107
Well, into the pot it goes.

37:11.280 --> 37:14.943
Perhaps we should become footpads.
Now all we need is the goods!

37:20.280 --> 37:22.145
(Baby grizzling)

37:39.320 --> 37:41.299
(Baby's crying echoes)

37:53.080 --> 37:55.059
Are you sure the goods will be safe here?

37:57.080 --> 37:59.662
It is only for one night.
Tomorrow we will be done.

37:59.840 --> 38:04.459
God willin'. Yet landin' a cargo 0' such value,
in utmost secrecy...

38:04.640 --> 38:07.097
It will not be plain sailing.

38:20.680 --> 38:23.240
Can you believe they're at this again?

38:25.360 --> 38:28.147
I seen Mister Ross an' the others jus' now,
headin' for the cove.

38:28.320 --> 38:29.457
Right, let's away.

38:29.640 --> 38:32.382
- Mister Ross did say we should stay indoors.
- He did.

38:32.560 --> 38:36.223
He also said I'm the mother of two small children
and should start behavin' like one!

38:36.400 --> 38:40.985
So Ena Daniel's upstairs with Clowance and
Jeremy and we're away to the meetin' house!

38:48.840 --> 38:49.977
There she is.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.267
(Voices approaching)

38:58.440 --> 39:00.021
Fall back!

39:04.960 --> 39:06.825
All's well.

39:11.200 --> 39:15.261
The meek and lowly heart

39:15.440 --> 39:19.979
That in our Saviour was

39:20.160 --> 39:25.097
To us that spirit doth impart...

39:31.240 --> 39:33.617
- Are we close?
- Surely, Captain Ross.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.461
Then let's get gone.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.822
Make haste, let's be gone!

39:49.240 --> 39:53.586
How can we sinners know

39:53.760 --> 39:58.379
Our sins on earth are forgiven?

39:58.560 --> 40:03.020
How can my gracious Saviour

40:03.200 --> 40:07.978
Show my name inscribed in heaven?

40:11.840 --> 40:13.819
We're not far now.

40:28.240 --> 40:32.461
We all his unknown peace receive

40:33.360 --> 40:38.582
And feel his blood applied

40:42.480 --> 40:44.505
We put out the candles an' wait in silence.

40:49.120 --> 40:52.339
If any be watching,
let's hope we've thrown them off the scent.

40:57.440 --> 40:59.704
Yah! Come on! Come on.

41:00.640 --> 41:02.141
(Owl hoots)

41:09.160 --> 41:11.105
(Door opens)

41:16.320 --> 41:18.220
- They're comin'.
- No one the wiser?

41:18.400 --> 41:20.027
So far, so good.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.337
You're certain it was he?

41:21.520 --> 41:25.183
He's most certain the ringleader.
There's no mistakin' the goods.

41:27.720 --> 41:30.280
I've suspicion I knows where they be heading.

41:40.480 --> 41:42.186
Did I not bid you stay at home?

41:42.360 --> 41:45.147
Yes, Ross, as oft I bid you
an' see how well you hear me!

41:46.640 --> 41:48.107
We bin actin' as decoys.

41:48.280 --> 41:51.181
And singing hymns at the top of our voices.

41:51.360 --> 41:53.225
What'll 'ee do?

41:54.840 --> 41:56.819
Get a good night's sleep.

41:58.160 --> 42:00.060
And awaken refreshed.

42:00.240 --> 42:05.780
As resident magistrate, I must have my wits
about me when I send them all to Botany Bay.

42:07.920 --> 42:09.899
- (Clears throat)
- Sir.

42:23.040 --> 42:26.419
TOM HARRY: The gaugers an ’ the m/iita/y
he on their way to the meetin’house.

42:26.600 --> 42:28.659
Do 'ee wish t' be there at the moment of arrest?

42:28.840 --> 42:30.944
Oh, I think so. Why should I miss all the fun?

42:31.760 --> 42:34.320
Ah, Morvvenna, you received my message?

42:34.480 --> 42:38.940
I've invited Mr Whitworth so that you may see
for yourself what an amiable man he is.

42:51.320 --> 42:53.026
You know what to do?

42:53.200 --> 42:55.418
But be sure the villagers keep it to theyselves.

42:55.600 --> 42:57.465
Surely, sister. Else will all hell break loose.

42:57.640 --> 43:00.347
'T'ain't fitty the Lord's house
being used for such a purpose.

43:00.520 --> 43:02.420
Get you gone. I'll to Caroline.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.463
The Reverend Whitworth
to see Miss Chynoweth.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.179
(Footsteps approaching)

43:22.720 --> 43:25.666
Compliments of the season to you,
Miss Chynoweth.

43:28.880 --> 43:30.859
Come on. Here.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.359
Brother.

43:32.520 --> 43:35.080
Come on now. Hurry.

43:35.240 --> 43:37.219
Folks do love a spectacle.

43:38.240 --> 43:42.825
An' none more pleasin'
than a fancy gent bein' led away to jail!

43:47.760 --> 43:51.901
Had my partner Willie Hick not led
the king of spades on the second round,

43:52.080 --> 43:54.139
I'd scarce have known where to look,

43:54.320 --> 43:58.666
but thereafter, by drawing trumps,
we made 12 tricks between us

43:58.840 --> 44:01.786
and I myself cleared 18 on the evening!

44:01.960 --> 44:03.587
(Laughs)

44:03.760 --> 44:05.739
Do you play whist?

44:06.960 --> 44:08.382
Not at all.

44:08.560 --> 44:09.743
Hm.

44:12.400 --> 44:17.178
May I say, Miss Chynoweth,
that I detect the hand of God in all this?

44:17.360 --> 44:19.669
Guiding me to the Warleggan ball,

44:19.840 --> 44:23.469
urging me to wear the lemon silk
so you could not fail to notice me.

44:24.320 --> 44:29.542
I felt at once that you'd been sent to console me,
to be a new mother to my two young daughters,

44:29.720 --> 44:34.419
to...comfort me as only a wife can.

44:35.480 --> 44:37.744
And now I know that my sentiments
are returned...

44:37.920 --> 44:40.059
I'm not at all sure they are returned.

44:40.240 --> 44:42.663
Your hesitancy does you credit.

44:42.840 --> 44:46.185
All decent women approach matrimony
with a degree of shyness.

44:46.360 --> 44:49.989
But as a man of feeling and a man of God...

44:51.000 --> 44:53.377
...I assure you my love will be returned.

45:01.760 --> 45:02.897
Mm.

45:03.760 --> 45:06.399
I pray you excuse me, sir. I cannot.

45:13.240 --> 45:16.346
- Did she refuse you?
- Oh, I'm not disheartened.

45:16.520 --> 45:18.704
Naturally she'll come round.

45:19.960 --> 45:23.509
In the meantime,
let us proceed with arrangements as planned.

45:35.880 --> 45:38.940
ROSS: I regret you've been sent
on a fool's errand, Captain.

45:40.360 --> 45:42.305
- Thank you very much, sir.
- No problem.

45:42.480 --> 45:44.937
- (Hymn being sung)
- Men.

45:46.520 --> 45:50.820
And labour on at thy command

45:51.000 --> 45:56.302
And offer all my works to thee

45:57.880 --> 46:02.863
Give me to bear thy easy yoke

46:03.600 --> 46:04.988
MAN: You're too kind.

46:05.160 --> 46:07.025
Good day to 'ee, sir.

46:07.200 --> 46:09.100
See the fruits of your generosity?

46:09.280 --> 46:11.840
Have you come to make further donation?

46:13.160 --> 46:14.479
- Donation?
- Yes, srr.

46:14.640 --> 46:16.904
See what your kind contribution
has purchased.

46:17.080 --> 46:18.581
Grain. A whole shipful!

46:18.760 --> 46:22.821
Now being sold at half the market price
to those most needy in the district.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.139
Shall I put you down for 70 guineas next time?

46:25.320 --> 46:26.708
There will be no next time.

46:26.880 --> 46:29.860
It is not my custom to contribute
to the welfare of wastrels

46:30.040 --> 46:31.985
who are too idle to earn their own bread.

46:32.160 --> 46:36.779
In which case,
may I ask what your business is here?

46:37.600 --> 46:40.626
For lest you're unaware, this is Nampara land.

46:40.800 --> 46:42.984
And it appears you're trespassing.

46:43.160 --> 46:47.062
As a magistrate, no doubt you're aware
of the penalty for such a crime?

46:47.920 --> 46:52.380
I advise you remove yourselves
or I'll call back the soldiers you sent

46:52.560 --> 46:54.699
and have you both arrested.

46:59.560 --> 47:00.743
(Clicks tongue)

47:07.640 --> 47:09.460
Bye!

47:11.520 --> 47:15.104
It was deliberate!
An elaborate subterfuge, designed to trick me.

47:15.280 --> 47:18.181
Or possibly with a view to preserving calm
and averting a riot?

47:18.360 --> 47:20.669
It was done so that I would believe
he was breaking the law

47:20.840 --> 47:24.185
and would look a fool
when I attempted to bring him to heel!

47:24.360 --> 47:26.737
Well, he's overplayed his hand this time.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.459
(Gulls cry)

47:59.320 --> 48:01.026
How's Williams?

48:02.040 --> 48:03.905
He's...improving.

48:04.080 --> 48:05.980
I'll sit with him awhile.

48:06.960 --> 48:10.418
No, I must keep him under observation
as I promised.

48:10.600 --> 48:13.421
Did I not vow to learn some of your skills?

48:14.720 --> 48:16.585
If only to give you one hour's rest in 20?

48:16.760 --> 48:18.387
I can manage.

48:18.560 --> 48:20.539
You saved my life.

48:21.760 --> 48:24.547
We need you alive so you can save others.

48:24.720 --> 48:29.066
With no fresh water, no medicine, no pain relief?

48:29.240 --> 48:31.219
GUARD: Faites vos paris.

48:32.560 --> 48:35.939
(Test le maigre ou le chauve?
Celui qui n'ai pas de cheveux.

48:36.120 --> 48:37.985
(Chuckling)

48:38.160 --> 48:40.139
They're taking bets.

48:40.320 --> 48:42.299
On what?

48:44.680 --> 48:46.659
Which prisoner will be next to die.

49:02.240 --> 49:04.219
Can I have word?

49:08.200 --> 49:10.509
George Warleggan's to close Wheal Leisure.

49:12.440 --> 49:13.862
With immediate effect.

49:14.960 --> 49:19.340
But why?
It'd mean the loss of more than 70 jobs.

49:19.520 --> 49:21.977
An' more hardship for 70 families
already struggling.

49:22.160 --> 49:24.105
The mine's still in profit.
Why close her now?

49:24.280 --> 49:25.542
Because he can.

49:25.720 --> 49:28.302
Because the profits are small
and keeping her open

49:28.480 --> 49:30.983
puts her in competition
with other Warleggan mines.

49:31.160 --> 49:34.903
Because she belonged to Ross
an' closin' her will hurt 'im.

49:36.440 --> 49:41.560
Soto spite Ross, George would send
70 families into direst poverty?

49:42.920 --> 49:44.308
'Tis about the size of it.

49:55.880 --> 49:57.700
I'm to be sent back to Trenwith?

49:57.880 --> 49:59.745
Along with Geoffrey Charles.

49:59.920 --> 50:01.820
Now pack your things at once.

50:03.680 --> 50:06.422
(Sobs mixed with giggles)

50:09.360 --> 50:10.543
GEORGE: Of course she weeps!

50:10.720 --> 50:15.066
To be forced to return to the tedium of Trenwith
after the happy bustle of Truro?

50:16.560 --> 50:21.099
She'll soon see the error of her ways and be
begging us to name a date for her wedding.

50:22.720 --> 50:24.699
(Laughing)

50:29.680 --> 50:32.137
DEMELZA:
I'd say we did what we set out to do.

50:32.320 --> 50:35.266
Five villages'll now survive the winter.

50:35.440 --> 50:36.907
Yes.

50:37.080 --> 50:39.423
But at a price we hadn't counted on.

50:39.600 --> 50:43.741
The closing of Wheal Leisure can only have
been triggered by our grain venture.

50:44.760 --> 50:48.537
So we've helped some and ruined others.

50:48.720 --> 50:50.699
70 families.

50:52.920 --> 50:54.387
What can we do for them?

50:55.280 --> 50:57.464
Ross, Demelza.

50:57.640 --> 51:00.427
I came to tell you that I'm leaving for London.

51:00.600 --> 51:02.465
- Have you had word of Dwight?
- From Unwin.

51:02.640 --> 51:05.666
He assures me that all is well
and I've no cause for concern.

51:07.560 --> 51:09.460
- What will you do?
- Go to the Admiralty.

51:09.640 --> 51:11.346
See if we can negotiate a ransom.

51:12.360 --> 51:14.339
I wish you luck.

51:17.080 --> 51:18.945
We'll bring him home.

51:19.120 --> 51:20.542
Somehow.

51:25.920 --> 51:28.184
The Admiralty doesn't deal in ransoms.

51:29.440 --> 51:31.419
(Coughing)

51:33.200 --> 51:34.940
Bless you, Enys...

51:36.520 --> 51:38.385
I think you'll live, Williams.

51:38.560 --> 51:42.189
And those barbarians wagered
he'd be next to die.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.422
Not ifI can help it.

51:44.600 --> 51:46.022
(Footsteps)

51:47.560 --> 51:49.869
- Par ici la sortie.
- No...

51:50.040 --> 51:51.746
(Gunshot)

51:52.760 --> 51:55.945
GUARD: J'ai gagn le pari. (Laughs)

52:02.200 --> 52:04.179
Dear God...

52:16.000 --> 52:17.979
(Sobbing)

52:42.080 --> 52:44.059
I have an idea.

52:46.920 --> 52:50.105
It's a delicate balance.
We're already over-manned.

52:50.280 --> 52:53.909
If we take on more men to take out more ore,
we flood the market.

52:54.080 --> 52:57.106
- The price drops.
- The ore runs out more quickly.

52:57.280 --> 53:00.181
But here and here and here...

53:00.360 --> 53:03.227
There have been indications
of possible new lodes.

53:03.400 --> 53:05.300
Which may or may not come to anything.

53:05.480 --> 53:07.459
And which we've so far opted not to explore.

53:07.640 --> 53:09.665
With an extra 30 men, we could explore.

53:09.840 --> 53:13.219
(Scoffs) 30 extra men? Each on a wage?

53:13.400 --> 53:15.265
Which I could pay.

53:15.440 --> 53:18.944
IfI opted to plough my profits back
into the mine, instead of taking a dividend.

53:19.120 --> 53:23.068
But now, Ross?
With the future so uncertain, a war with France?

53:23.240 --> 53:25.504
And a wife and two children to support?

53:25.680 --> 53:27.500
My wife is in agreement with me.

53:31.440 --> 53:33.067
Good to see you.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.381
Well done.

53:44.960 --> 53:46.587
I will sing twelve-oh

53:46.760 --> 53:48.466
What is your twelve-oh?

53:48.640 --> 53:50.426
Twelve are the twelve Apostles

53:50.600 --> 53:52.420
Eleven are the eleven will go to heaven

53:52.600 --> 53:54.101
Ten are the Ten Commandments

53:54.280 --> 53:56.259
Nine is the moonshine bright and clear

53:57.840 --> 53:59.057
Need a hand, do 'ee, sirs?

53:59.240 --> 54:01.219
Drake! We're back!

54:03.160 --> 54:04.479
Miss Morwenna.

54:09.760 --> 54:10.897
(Grunts)

54:13.560 --> 54:16.302
I think we should let Mr Came
continue on his way.

54:16.480 --> 54:17.617
Go!

54:20.000 --> 54:23.504
Bye, Drake.
Come and visit us soon!

54:26.120 --> 54:27.542
Thanks for thy help, brother.

54:27.720 --> 54:29.585
They're back.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.585
GEORGE: How long wﬂl Morwenna require?
ELIZ45E7'l-l: A few weeks
at least

54:49.000 --> 54:51.582
I must confess, I'm not overly enamoured of him.

54:51.760 --> 54:54.547
There's something about him
that makes my skin crawl.

54:54.720 --> 54:57.666
The man is a reptile and a prig.
He is also a Godolphin.

54:57.840 --> 55:00.183
Morwenna does not realise how luclq she is.

55:02.120 --> 55:03.508
But she will realise.

55:06.560 --> 55:10.189
Gold brocade and britches close-fitting.

55:11.200 --> 55:17.662
To inspire in a bride, both awe and anticipation.

55:18.640 --> 55:19.823
(Grunts)

55:21.560 --> 55:26.862
I liked Morvvenna,
she seemed gentle and kindly.

55:27.040 --> 55:28.780
This return, though, I fear it.

55:28.960 --> 55:31.099
She an' Drake cannot come to good.

55:31.280 --> 55:32.542
George will be livid.

55:32.720 --> 55:34.381
That's good enough for me.

55:34.560 --> 55:38.940
But a low-born miner's son aspiring
to the heart of his wife's cousin?

55:39.120 --> 55:40.439
Why should he object,

55:40.600 --> 55:45.299
when a lowly mine owner
can aspire to the hand of a great lady?

55:45.480 --> 55:47.186
That's different!

55:47.360 --> 55:51.785
I hope Mon/venna knows it's different
and takes care to stay out of Drake's way.
