01:46.608 --> 01:47.775
What do I do?

01:48.693 --> 01:49.819
Inhale.

01:51.946 --> 01:52.947
Cough.

01:57.076 --> 01:58.244
And repeat.

02:03.207 --> 02:04.500
I'm leaving.

02:05.209 --> 02:08.630
After I graduate, I'm... I'm out of here.

02:14.010 --> 02:15.553
If I stay...

02:17.847 --> 02:19.682
nothing's gonna change.

02:21.893 --> 02:24.437
I'm always gonna be what they think I am.

02:35.281 --> 02:36.658
You should leave, too.

02:38.660 --> 02:39.535
Me?

02:41.704 --> 02:43.247
You gotta be careful, John.

02:43.998 --> 02:46.834
We can never be what we want
if we stay here.

02:50.213 --> 02:51.422
Where are you gonna go?

02:52.006 --> 02:53.257
It doesn't matter.

02:55.301 --> 02:57.887
Just gonna get in Dad's old truck and...

03:00.056 --> 03:01.265
just drive.

03:14.654 --> 03:15.530
Hi.

03:17.407 --> 03:18.699
What's going on?

03:21.494 --> 03:22.495
I'm taking him.

03:24.831 --> 03:27.333
It's time he came with me, you know?

03:30.545 --> 03:32.463
Hey, thanks for letting me stay here.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.590
Yeah. You take care of yourself.

03:39.595 --> 03:40.471
Hey, come on.

04:01.868 --> 04:03.077
I shouldn't be here.

04:03.661 --> 04:07.206
I'm not gonna pretend like I'm sorry
about the other night.

04:08.082 --> 04:11.210
But I do know you're seeing someone,
so I don't wanna screw things up for you.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.670
That's not what I'm talking about.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.548
What are you talking about, then?

04:16.716 --> 04:17.925
You lied to me.

04:20.678 --> 04:23.556
Alec Moros
wasn't in this house that night.

04:25.767 --> 04:28.352
-Yes, he was.
-Meg, he was in New York.

04:28.436 --> 04:29.437
No, that's not true.

04:29.645 --> 04:32.273
I spoke to him. He was in New York.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.154
I mean, well, maybe
I got the nights confused.

04:38.362 --> 04:39.197
Hmm.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.618
Hear me out.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.370
Don't speak, and hear me out.

04:46.954 --> 04:47.789
Sure.

04:48.748 --> 04:50.208
You lied to me...

04:50.750 --> 04:53.878
and I think John lied to me, too,
and maybe you're protecting your brother.

04:54.212 --> 04:57.089
Now, that's not a very smart thing
for you to be doing right now.

04:57.840 --> 05:01.260
I'm... I probably got the nights confused,
Marco, but I didn't lie to you.

05:01.344 --> 05:02.470
Meg.

05:03.554 --> 05:06.474
I'm giving you a chance
to get out in front of it,

05:06.557 --> 05:09.477
whatever it is, before it's too late.

05:13.397 --> 05:17.235
And come in and talk to me again. Please.

05:18.194 --> 05:20.279
I don't know anything, Marco.

05:22.824 --> 05:24.325
Be careful.

05:24.408 --> 05:27.036
I know John's family,
but you need to look out for yourself.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.301
Mom, you have to keep track of these.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.971
It's too fucking complicated.

05:45.054 --> 05:46.472
I laid them out for you.

05:47.306 --> 05:48.849
Where's your pill schedule?

05:49.725 --> 05:51.060
What?

05:51.227 --> 05:53.354
The sheet I gave her. The laminated one.

05:55.106 --> 05:56.732
-I don't know.
-Jesus Christ, Eric.

05:56.816 --> 05:58.401
You gotta help me out with this.

05:58.484 --> 06:01.571
-She can't keep half the pills down.
-I toss that shit right up.

06:01.654 --> 06:03.614
Well, I can give you something for nausea.

06:03.698 --> 06:08.703
What I need is groceries. Lemon Cremes
and the Fudgies with the little stripes.

06:08.786 --> 06:10.204
What's that?

06:11.581 --> 06:14.000
It's called "Heavenly Protection."

06:14.166 --> 06:17.878
I can't fucking believe this.
You can't afford to keep buying this crap.

06:17.962 --> 06:23.134
On TV, they said there were only 43 left,
and they knocked the price way down.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.135
Put it on the shelf.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.762
No. We're returning it.

06:29.390 --> 06:32.727
Now, this pill,
this one you take twice a day.

06:32.810 --> 06:35.021
Once in the morning and once at night.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.857
This one you take three times a day.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.150
And this blue one...

06:39.609 --> 06:40.651
only take when you need it.

06:40.735 --> 06:41.944
For constipation.

06:45.281 --> 06:47.950
- Who is it?
- Monroe County Sheriff's Department.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.462
What do you want?

06:59.545 --> 07:01.964
I'm sorry to bother you at home.
Can I have a word with you?

07:03.174 --> 07:04.759
What happened with you and Marco?

07:06.260 --> 07:09.096
Meg, we have to assume that Marco
is no longer a friend of ours.

07:09.805 --> 07:12.516
This isn't just
Aguirre's bullshit anymore.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.893
'Cause Marco, he's...

07:13.976 --> 07:16.562
He's trying to make
a case against us, Meg.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.523
He knows I lied.

07:21.317 --> 07:22.610
He says you lied to him, too.

07:23.069 --> 07:26.822
-He has no way of knowing that, Meg.
-Then why would he say it?

07:26.989 --> 07:29.742
Because he doesn't have anything.
That's why he brought you in.

07:29.825 --> 07:32.286
Let me guess. He brings you in,
asks you a bunch of questions,

07:32.370 --> 07:34.455
and then he tries to turn you against me.

07:35.414 --> 07:36.457
Basically, yeah.

07:36.624 --> 07:39.585
The only way that he can get
anything on us...

07:41.420 --> 07:43.214
is if he turns us against each other.

07:44.298 --> 07:48.678
Short of that, he's just gonna keep
looking for every angle he can.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.227
There's something that you don't know.

08:00.815 --> 08:03.442
The information
about Aguirre and his wife...

08:04.527 --> 08:05.945
I released that.

08:11.117 --> 08:12.994
Why are you telling me this now?

08:13.619 --> 08:15.705
Because there's more to the story.

08:19.709 --> 08:22.128
Marco was the responding officer.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.717
He never filed an incident report.

08:29.844 --> 08:32.763
And three weeks later,
the sheriff's department hired him.

08:37.977 --> 08:44.150
You realize that Internal Affairs
will have a field day with that.

08:44.734 --> 08:48.654
That Marco and Aguirre
will be waist-high in shit.

08:49.155 --> 08:52.366
And they won't even have time
to wipe their asses, Meg.

08:55.036 --> 08:56.871
I just can't do it, John.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.875
I can't do that to him.

09:01.542 --> 09:04.170
He's never ever done one thing
to hurt me.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.803
How close is he?

09:19.393 --> 09:20.603
I don't know.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.482
The other day, you said something.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.817
Something that I gotta get clear on.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.613
You told me to look
into the Rayburn family.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.114
Why did you tell me that?

09:33.324 --> 09:34.533
Ask John.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.410
Why?

09:38.162 --> 09:39.997
He was the last person to see Danny alive.

09:40.206 --> 09:41.582
Why just John?

09:41.916 --> 09:43.417
The whole family saw him together.

09:44.460 --> 09:45.294
When?

09:45.795 --> 09:48.339
Night of the Red Reef,
Danny went to the inn.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.800
-Whole family was there--
-I'm not talking about that, dude.

09:50.883 --> 09:53.135
-Then what are you talking about?
-I'm talking about--

09:54.428 --> 09:55.971
I'm talking about the next morning.

09:57.348 --> 10:00.267
The next morning, John didn't see anybody.

10:01.352 --> 10:03.354
He had a heart attack at his house.
I mean...

10:04.730 --> 10:05.940
-That's what he's saying?
-Yeah.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.566
He was working his lawn,
he had a heart attack,

10:07.650 --> 10:09.360
he called Meg,
Meg took him to the hospital.

10:10.611 --> 10:11.821
He's lying.

10:16.117 --> 10:17.827
He met with Danny.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.371
How do you know?

10:21.747 --> 10:22.957
I know.

10:26.127 --> 10:27.086
Dude...

10:28.879 --> 10:29.797
I know shit.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.883
Some shit that I have not...

10:34.260 --> 10:36.137
fucking told anyone.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.139
What shit do you know?

10:38.514 --> 10:42.101
Uh-uh. I need protection.

10:44.979 --> 10:49.900
I tell my story,
I want full fucking immunity.

10:50.985 --> 10:52.444
Immunity from what?

10:54.029 --> 10:56.448
Everything. Anything.

10:56.532 --> 10:59.326
'Cause I talk, God knows what
you motherfuckers gonna try to pop on me.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.078
Well, then I need more.

11:02.288 --> 11:03.706
John saw Danny?

11:03.998 --> 11:04.832
Where?

11:05.499 --> 11:06.333
When?

11:07.668 --> 11:08.961
Immunity...

11:09.503 --> 11:11.297
or I don't fucking say shit.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.343
Prove to me that you know something.

11:21.515 --> 11:24.977
Go ask John's daughter about
the necklace that Danny gave her.

11:28.522 --> 11:29.815
What necklace?

11:31.025 --> 11:32.359
Just ask her.

11:53.339 --> 11:56.634
So, what you're saying is you wanna
take a look at our security feed.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.762
We just wanna see how far back
the footage goes

11:59.845 --> 12:01.972
for the traffic
along this stretch of road.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.725
It's the only access to the beach.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.686
Uh-huh.

12:07.770 --> 12:10.898
And my tax dollars are going towards
you coming here and hassling me

12:10.981 --> 12:12.900
over my private personal property?

12:13.651 --> 12:16.528
What you'd be doing is helping
Monroe County Sheriff Department

12:16.612 --> 12:19.990
in a number of investigations, ongoing.

12:20.074 --> 12:21.659
Well, that doesn't answer my question.

12:24.244 --> 12:28.582
Yes, your tax dollars do pay my salary.
I'm very grateful for that.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.422
I assume you have
some sort of a signed warrant.

12:35.506 --> 12:37.091
You know, maybe there's
a misunderstanding here.

12:37.174 --> 12:40.260
I have no interest at all
about your property.

12:40.511 --> 12:46.058
I only want to know about the traffic
that moves along this road. That's it.

12:46.642 --> 12:50.270
That's what the feds told Sheldon Burkes
over at Magnolia Farms two years ago.

12:53.148 --> 12:57.111
Listen, it's just this...
It's just this stretch of road.

12:57.194 --> 12:59.822
Why don't we reopen this
once we get that warrant?

13:00.864 --> 13:01.740
Have a good day.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.744
Yeah. You, too, you son of a bitch.

13:07.121 --> 13:08.288
Baby.

13:09.707 --> 13:10.916
Hey, babe?

13:13.127 --> 13:15.546
Babe, check this out. Look what I got.

13:19.008 --> 13:20.551
Oh, man.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.228
<i>Hey, leave a message.</i>

13:32.479 --> 13:34.189
Hey, luscious. Where you at?

13:34.440 --> 13:38.861
I just drove all the way to Miami,
and I got you something.

13:38.944 --> 13:40.154
Oh, yeah.

13:40.237 --> 13:42.823
I can't wait to see your face
when you see the...

13:43.532 --> 13:44.742
When you...

13:44.825 --> 13:46.035
When you, um...

13:46.785 --> 13:48.412
Um...

13:49.997 --> 13:53.292
Baby, um, where you at, huh?

13:54.960 --> 13:58.255
Do, um...? I mean, your shit...
Your shit's not here.

13:59.757 --> 14:00.883
Where the fuck you at?

14:01.050 --> 14:04.887
You wanna call me back and tell me
what the fuck is going on? Huh?

14:04.970 --> 14:06.180
Okay.

14:06.263 --> 14:07.473
Bye.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.645
The shower's been leaking for a year,

14:13.729 --> 14:15.689
and I can't seem to get anybody to fix it.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.983
Do we get maid service?

14:18.067 --> 14:19.902
Paying guests get maid service.

14:19.985 --> 14:21.945
Yeah. We don't need any of that.

14:23.781 --> 14:25.407
I'm happy to have you.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.453
But while you're here,
I expect you to help out.

14:30.788 --> 14:32.081
Doing what?

14:32.164 --> 14:34.708
-Whatever Sally wants.
-Well, we'll find something.

14:34.792 --> 14:37.419
There's no end to the things
that need to get done around here.

14:38.087 --> 14:40.089
Yeah. It'll be nice to be useful.

14:40.172 --> 14:42.633
Just whatever you need.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.761
This was always a family place.

14:46.512 --> 14:49.473
Hasn't seemed much like that lately,
but, um...

14:50.474 --> 14:52.559
maybe you two can change that.

14:56.146 --> 14:56.980
Let's, uh...

14:57.064 --> 14:59.233
Let's go in,
and I'll show you the space.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.031
I'm going over to Paul's.

15:06.115 --> 15:08.617
Hm. Are you still working
on that assignment?

15:08.700 --> 15:09.868
Yeah. It's due tomorrow.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.412
- Good luck with it, honey.
- Bye, guys.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.746
Have a good night.

15:13.455 --> 15:14.832
I downloaded that app.

15:15.416 --> 15:17.000
Seriously, I hate you.

15:17.292 --> 15:19.002
Why? It's fun.

15:19.711 --> 15:22.423
I can't stop playing it.
I don't know how you get anything done.

15:22.506 --> 15:23.715
It's called multi-tasking, Mom.

15:23.799 --> 15:26.093
Mm. Yeah. I should try that sometime.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.614
I'm glad he's gone.

15:52.369 --> 15:53.579
What?

15:56.915 --> 15:58.208
Nolan.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.920
I just couldn't stand him here anymore.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.302
He showed up...

16:08.719 --> 16:12.514
after Danny was gone, and no one
even knew he existed until then?

16:13.474 --> 16:14.600
Nope.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.728
Now, what does that mean to you?

16:21.023 --> 16:22.232
Nothing.

16:30.741 --> 16:32.659
Should I be worried about him?

16:37.748 --> 16:40.167
You said you didn't wanna talk about this.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.003
Let's not talk about this.

16:47.508 --> 16:48.926
I wanna know.

16:51.929 --> 16:53.764
Should I be worried about him?

17:00.521 --> 17:01.396
No.

17:31.885 --> 17:32.886
Hank.

17:34.805 --> 17:35.722
Hey.

17:38.809 --> 17:40.519
Whiskey and cigars?

17:41.061 --> 17:42.646
You must be in quite a jam.

17:42.729 --> 17:43.939
Well, I like you.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.732
Yeah, I doubt that.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.652
Forget about this.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.862
Let's say you hook me up
with that sister of yours.

17:50.946 --> 17:53.073
You realize I got a gun
on my hip, don't you?

17:55.325 --> 17:58.161
Listen, I was over at
the Cardozo Farms the other day.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.789
I'm surprised that bastard
let you on his property,

18:00.872 --> 18:03.166
given you're an agent
of the government and all.

18:03.292 --> 18:06.086
No, that's what-- He didn't
let me on, but I'd like to get on.

18:07.087 --> 18:07.921
What for?

18:08.422 --> 18:10.340
Well, you know, it's an investigation.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.719
What do you need?

18:14.386 --> 18:16.388
I'd like to look at
the security system over there.

18:17.222 --> 18:18.849
Like, as in the cameras?

18:19.600 --> 18:20.642
That's right.

18:22.227 --> 18:23.270
You can't get a warrant?

18:26.064 --> 18:27.691
There's nothing you can do?

18:29.359 --> 18:31.570
They keep everything
on servers these days.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.115
I don't have the resources.

18:36.658 --> 18:38.660
What, are you fucking telling me
you can't?

18:38.869 --> 18:39.953
I can't.

18:42.623 --> 18:44.249
All right. Well...

18:45.959 --> 18:47.878
enjoy my fucking cigars.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.131
- Hey, John.
- Yeah?

18:52.758 --> 18:54.676
I might know a guy
who's into that kind of thing.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.889
-Can you trust him?
-Absolutely.

18:59.598 --> 19:01.475
He owes me a couple favors, too.

19:02.392 --> 19:03.602
What do you need?

19:06.897 --> 19:09.399
On the north gate, there are two cameras.

19:10.150 --> 19:13.111
I wanna know what's on those cameras
over the past six months.

19:13.403 --> 19:14.821
I'll call my guy.

19:15.364 --> 19:17.491
I can't make any promises, but...

19:17.574 --> 19:19.993
when he gets back to me,
you'll be the first to know.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.039
I appreciate that.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.415
See you, buddy.

19:37.719 --> 19:38.762
Shit.

19:53.402 --> 19:55.195
- Hello there, sir.
- Hey.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.739
-Hey. Hope I'm not overstepping.
-No.

19:57.823 --> 20:00.367
Wanted a place to park this sucker
for a week or so.

20:00.450 --> 20:03.704
Hey, trust me, you buy this place,
you got all the docking space you need.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.622
Oh, I like the sound of that.

20:05.706 --> 20:08.083
-Hey, come on. Let me get you a coffee.
-Yeah, sure.

20:10.752 --> 20:13.088
So?

20:13.839 --> 20:14.840
My offer.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.343
Now, that's contingent
upon you sticking around.

20:18.427 --> 20:19.594
You want me to stay?

20:19.678 --> 20:23.056
Absolutely. You know the place,
you know the clientele.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.892
I want you in charge of all operations.

20:28.562 --> 20:30.063
-There a problem?
-No.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.607
Uh...

20:33.024 --> 20:35.193
Wow. Um...

20:35.277 --> 20:38.822
Thank you. I'm just not used to
people having faith in me, that's all.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.824
-Oh...
-I appreciate this.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.326
Oh, it's a gift to get to do
the thing you love.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.079
-Brings out the best in people. Mm.
-Yes, sir.

20:47.748 --> 20:49.541
So, that number work for you?

20:50.125 --> 20:51.334
Yeah. That's gonna work.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.170
-That's gonna work just fine.
-Beautiful.

20:53.336 --> 20:55.297
I'll draw up the paperwork,
get it to your sister.

20:55.714 --> 20:56.548
Thank you.

20:56.715 --> 20:58.425
-Oh, yeah.
-Thank you, Mr. Gilbert.

20:58.508 --> 20:59.468
Yeah.

21:05.724 --> 21:06.933
Janey.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.729
-Is my dad okay?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:10.812 --> 21:13.231
-What are you doing here?
-Relax. Your dad's fine.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.192
I just need to ask you a couple questions.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.234
About what?

21:16.777 --> 21:17.903
Danny.

21:18.612 --> 21:19.571
Okay.

21:19.863 --> 21:21.156
The day that Danny went missing,

21:21.239 --> 21:23.408
you, your mom, your brother,
you guys were out of town,

21:23.492 --> 21:24.534
-right?
-Right.

21:24.701 --> 21:26.828
And that was right after
you and Danny went out on the boat?

21:26.912 --> 21:27.746
Uh-huh.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.540
That day he mentioned
something about a necklace.

21:31.082 --> 21:33.794
Oh, yeah. Uncle Danny gave me
some necklace as, like, a present.

21:33.877 --> 21:34.878
My dad didn't like it.

21:35.837 --> 21:36.671
Is that it?

21:37.297 --> 21:39.466
This? Oh, no. It was a seahorse.

21:39.549 --> 21:41.343
-A seahorse.
-Yeah.

21:41.426 --> 21:43.011
I was just looking for it the other day.

21:43.595 --> 21:44.429
You know where it is?

21:45.013 --> 21:46.389
Nope. I don't know.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.934
My dad took it from me,
like, when I first got it.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.019
And I asked him about it
the other day, but...

21:51.937 --> 21:54.147
-But what?
-He said he lost it.

21:57.484 --> 22:00.570
-What does it matter anyway, though?
-Actually, it doesn't matter.

22:00.654 --> 22:02.948
I'm just tying up loose ends.

22:03.073 --> 22:04.825
Boring cop shit.

22:04.908 --> 22:07.077
Okay. Well, remind me
not to become a boring cop.

22:07.702 --> 22:09.162
I will. Bye, Janey.

22:09.246 --> 22:10.080
See you.

22:21.216 --> 22:22.801
-Hey, Mom.
-Hi, honey.

22:24.219 --> 22:26.096
Was that Marco you were talking to?

22:26.179 --> 22:27.305
Yeah, it was.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.182
What did he want?

22:29.266 --> 22:30.976
Oh, he just wanted to ask me
some questions.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.382
Wait, wait--

23:02.465 --> 23:04.467
What did--? What did he ask her about?

23:04.551 --> 23:06.386
I couldn't exactly grill
Janey for details,

23:06.469 --> 23:08.513
but he wanted to know about the necklace.

23:08.722 --> 23:10.223
What about the necklace?

23:10.307 --> 23:12.350
He asked her where it was.

23:14.144 --> 23:15.020
<i>John?</i>

23:15.645 --> 23:17.063
<i>What's going on?</i>

23:17.147 --> 23:18.607
I don't know. I--

23:20.317 --> 23:22.152
What the fuck do you mean,
you don't know?

23:24.404 --> 23:26.281
<i>You told me we were safe.</i>

23:26.948 --> 23:27.991
<i>We were.</i>

23:28.325 --> 23:29.451
And now?

23:32.537 --> 23:34.623
<i>Jesus, John. Talk to me.</i>

23:35.040 --> 23:37.334
Listen to me.
I'll take care of this, all right?

23:37.417 --> 23:38.460
Yeah.

23:39.377 --> 23:40.670
Yeah, you will.

23:42.922 --> 23:46.676
Diana, there is nothing in the world that
means more to me than you and the kids.

23:58.772 --> 23:59.773
What do we got?

23:59.898 --> 24:02.484
O'Bannon says John's lying
about the last time he saw Danny.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.945
-About what? The Red Reef?
-I don't know. Don't get too excited.

24:06.029 --> 24:08.615
We're talking about O'Bannon here,
and he may be full of shit.

24:08.698 --> 24:09.532
So, bring him in.

24:09.616 --> 24:13.286
He says he won't come in
unless we give him immunity.

24:13.662 --> 24:16.414
If he wants immunity,
he better tell us a good fucking story.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.333
He says he has one,
and he says he can prove it.

24:18.416 --> 24:19.250
Can he?

24:21.002 --> 24:23.380
He may... He may know something.

24:27.676 --> 24:29.052
Gnarly Harley.

24:29.719 --> 24:30.804
Christ.

24:32.555 --> 24:33.598
Heard you skipped town.

24:33.890 --> 24:35.392
Well, I skipped back.

24:37.227 --> 24:38.311
Your mom dead yet?

24:39.938 --> 24:41.314
That's really sweet.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.733
I wouldn't mind rummaging
through that shithole of hers.

24:43.817 --> 24:45.527
It's always the batshit ones like her...

24:45.610 --> 24:47.696
Sit on treasure half their life,
don't know what they have.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.322
I need the...

24:49.406 --> 24:52.367
The thing I sold you right before
I skipped town. I need it back.

24:54.369 --> 24:55.453
It's important.

24:56.037 --> 24:56.913
Well...

24:58.123 --> 25:01.126
I'm sure you'd be willing to part with
whatever you got in that sack.

25:09.134 --> 25:10.635
Heavenly Protection.

25:11.594 --> 25:12.470
Hummel?

25:13.304 --> 25:14.431
Well...

25:14.639 --> 25:15.849
Fuck me, O'Bannon.

25:16.975 --> 25:18.059
We got a deal.

25:28.403 --> 25:29.779
Worth maybe half a Hummel.

25:31.865 --> 25:35.034
O'Bannon, you, my friend,
are a crack negotiator.

25:37.871 --> 25:39.497
You come back and see me anytime, huh?

25:57.474 --> 25:58.308
Hey.

26:01.102 --> 26:02.061
Yeah?

26:03.646 --> 26:04.939
You go to my daughter's school,

26:05.023 --> 26:07.901
and out in the parking lot,
you ask her fucking questions?

26:08.693 --> 26:12.405
The last thing I wanted to do
was drag Janey in here

26:12.489 --> 26:14.783
and ask her questions
in front of everybody,

26:14.866 --> 26:17.577
and turn this whole thing into
something that it wasn't, okay?

26:18.995 --> 26:20.413
She's 16.

26:26.795 --> 26:28.004
You're right, John.

26:29.714 --> 26:31.800
I should've reached out to you first.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.136
I'm sorry.

26:40.725 --> 26:44.395
<i>♪ Sweet</i>
<i>Ain't it sweet ♪</i>

26:45.897 --> 26:49.818
<i>♪ Ain't it sweet to know</i>
<i>There one day will be ♪</i>

26:49.901 --> 26:53.238
Contracts my lawyers drew up.
All they need is your brother's signature.

26:53.321 --> 26:55.281
Oh, thank you. I will look at these.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.451
Any more nuisance suits
you needed to settle?

26:58.535 --> 26:59.744
Yes. About that, I have--

26:59.828 --> 27:01.204
Mezcal, two.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.122
-Sure.
-I'm sorry. You were saying...

27:03.790 --> 27:06.376
The problem has been taken care of.

27:06.459 --> 27:09.838
It's just that there is
a campaign deficit involved.

27:10.797 --> 27:11.881
I see.

27:14.092 --> 27:15.969
You've been more than generous,
obviously.

27:16.052 --> 27:20.640
Have you sent my office an invoice
for the legal work you did for me?

27:22.600 --> 27:23.643
Excuse me?

27:24.978 --> 27:26.813
The legal consulting you did.

27:27.981 --> 27:30.483
- I didn't--
- For your brother's boatyard.

27:30.567 --> 27:32.443
Have you billed my office yet?

27:34.404 --> 27:36.698
Mr. Gilbert,
it's a considerable amount of money.

27:37.282 --> 27:38.867
Well, you've earned it.

27:39.784 --> 27:41.536
We have you on retainer, isn't that right?

27:42.912 --> 27:45.123
Mr. Gilbert,
I'm not comfortable with that.

27:45.290 --> 27:48.126
Nonsense. You've done such fine work.

27:48.209 --> 27:50.336
Send the bill as soon as possible.

27:51.504 --> 27:54.340
- Better to wrap up these things quickly.
- Here you go.

27:58.011 --> 27:59.929
You'll learn with
a little creative thinking,

28:00.013 --> 28:02.515
you can accomplish anything you want.

28:20.158 --> 28:21.868
God, I hate fucking fishing.

28:27.582 --> 28:29.167
My girl's gone.

28:30.752 --> 28:31.961
What does that mean?

28:33.046 --> 28:34.047
It means she's gone.

28:34.130 --> 28:37.550
She's not calling me back.
I don't know what the fuck to do, man.

28:38.301 --> 28:40.136
I'm sorry, dude. That sucks.

28:44.224 --> 28:45.975
Maybe I should just
get the fuck out of here.

28:46.059 --> 28:48.561
Go back to Miami, track her ass down.

28:50.688 --> 28:54.484
You still working on that thing you said
you were working on down here?

28:55.276 --> 28:56.527
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

29:03.618 --> 29:04.744
There you go.

29:05.536 --> 29:08.414
Grade A Rayburn cash, as promised.

29:08.498 --> 29:11.000
Holy fuck.

29:13.586 --> 29:14.879
You got this from them?

29:16.422 --> 29:17.715
I can get a lot more.

29:18.299 --> 29:20.301
'Cause not only are these people
fucking amateurs,

29:20.385 --> 29:22.262
they got a guilty fucking conscience.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.266
As well they fucking should.

29:27.725 --> 29:28.726
John...

29:30.436 --> 29:33.815
Detective fucking John Rayburn,
he lied to the cops.

29:35.525 --> 29:36.693
Well, how do you know?

29:38.486 --> 29:39.445
I know.

29:41.614 --> 29:42.865
And if I tell the cops,

29:42.949 --> 29:45.785
then they'll clear me from all the shit
that happened at the Red Reef.

29:47.036 --> 29:48.830
You're talking to the cops?

29:49.247 --> 29:50.873
-They came to me.
-Oh, come on.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.458
-What?
-Come on, man.

29:52.750 --> 29:56.379
This is our golden opportunity, man.
This is our golden ticket, bro.

29:57.171 --> 29:59.590
You don't have a murder beef hanging
over you, do you?

29:59.674 --> 30:01.092
I'd love to see John Rayburn exposed

30:01.175 --> 30:03.428
-as the fraud that he is.
-Shut the fuck up. What is this?

30:03.970 --> 30:05.054
-I think it's my cut.
-No.

30:05.138 --> 30:07.265
This is nothing. That's shit, okay?

30:07.348 --> 30:09.142
-It's gonna get fucking wet.
-Leave it there.

30:09.225 --> 30:11.060
-It's gonna get wet on the fucking--
-Leave it.

30:11.144 --> 30:12.854
You don't deserve that shit.

30:12.937 --> 30:17.608
This is nothing compared to what we could
really have, you dipshit. You understand?

30:18.318 --> 30:21.404
Yeah, I fucking understand,
but I got a situation I gotta deal with.

30:21.487 --> 30:24.365
You got a sit--?
Fuck your situation, okay?

30:27.577 --> 30:29.787
You know for a fact
that John lied to the cops?

30:30.997 --> 30:31.956
Yeah.

30:32.373 --> 30:33.875
You got proof?

30:34.792 --> 30:36.294
I can prove it, yeah.

30:37.879 --> 30:41.591
Well, then... you don't go to the cops.

30:41.924 --> 30:45.094
You don't bite the tit that feeds you,
you hear me?

30:45.720 --> 30:48.264
'Cause we own this motherfucker.

30:56.898 --> 30:59.067
- Yeah?
<i>- You at a computer?</i>

30:59.484 --> 31:00.485
Yeah.

31:01.110 --> 31:03.321
<i>You're gonna get</i>
<i>a secure link and a password.</i>

31:04.280 --> 31:05.782
<i>It'll be good for 24 hours.</i>

31:06.866 --> 31:08.493
<i>It should get you what you need.</i>

31:10.328 --> 31:11.245
Hey, Hank?

31:12.705 --> 31:14.082
-Thank you.
<i>-Yep.</i>

32:24.902 --> 32:26.195
You okay?

32:27.447 --> 32:29.073
Hi. Yeah.

32:29.657 --> 32:30.658
I'm fine.

32:33.035 --> 32:34.620
Have you seen Marco?

32:37.081 --> 32:38.499
Why would you ask me that?

32:38.916 --> 32:42.128
Well, whenever you used to have
a problem with a boy...

32:43.504 --> 32:45.131
I'd find you out here.

32:46.090 --> 32:47.717
Mom, that was in high school.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.802
Yeah, I guess so.

32:50.928 --> 32:52.346
Hi, Meg!

32:56.976 --> 32:58.019
What is she doing here?

32:59.604 --> 33:01.522
She's staying here with Nolan.

33:03.774 --> 33:05.026
For how long?

33:06.527 --> 33:08.070
As long as they want.

33:14.327 --> 33:15.661
Was that why you invited me here?

33:17.497 --> 33:18.414
Yeah.

33:19.081 --> 33:20.541
I thought you all should know.

33:22.543 --> 33:26.422
Maybe you can... tell John and Kevin.

33:27.340 --> 33:28.925
Uh...

33:29.509 --> 33:31.302
Okay. Yeah.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.930
How is Kevin anyway?

33:34.514 --> 33:37.725
He's going to meetings. He's good.

33:37.808 --> 33:41.521
And he just got Roy Gilbert to invest
in the boatyard

33:41.604 --> 33:43.523
so now he's doing good financially, too.

33:48.986 --> 33:49.904
Mom?

33:51.697 --> 33:53.533
I do not like that man.

33:55.451 --> 33:57.411
I thought he was a friend of Dad's.

33:57.495 --> 34:01.499
Your father and Roy Gilbert
were not friends.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.794
Did something happen
that I should know about?

34:06.671 --> 34:10.383
What you should know is that Roy Gilbert
wants what's best for Roy Gilbert,

34:10.466 --> 34:11.884
and that's all he wants.

34:12.885 --> 34:14.929
And he'll do whatever it takes to get it.

34:21.435 --> 34:24.146
Hey, I wanna show you something.
Come with me.

34:24.230 --> 34:25.231
All right.

34:38.703 --> 34:40.162
I don't know, Kev.

34:41.539 --> 34:45.710
-Why, is something wrong with the terms?
-No. The terms are fine. It's...

34:46.836 --> 34:49.255
Do you realize that you're gonna give up
control to Gilbert?

34:50.590 --> 34:52.717
The other guy wanted to bend me over
and kick me out.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.844
It's a hell of a lot better
than that, isn't it?

34:55.845 --> 34:59.557
Maybe just... think it over some more.

34:59.640 --> 35:02.768
Give me some time to do
some due diligence on Gilbert.

35:03.352 --> 35:05.563
I don't have any more time.
What's going on?

35:05.646 --> 35:08.608
You're the one who hooked me up
with this guy in the first place.

35:11.027 --> 35:13.487
-You know the guy that I paid off?
-Yeah.

35:14.196 --> 35:16.657
Gilbert is the one that gave me the money.

35:19.035 --> 35:22.038
I just don't know
if that is the kind of guy

35:22.121 --> 35:23.748
you should be doing business with.

35:28.169 --> 35:31.964
Meg, if I fuck this up, if I lose this...

35:33.466 --> 35:36.969
I'm telling you, I'm gonna end up selling
fucking drills down at Harry's Hardware.

35:37.053 --> 35:39.764
-No, you're not.
-Yes, Meg, I am.

35:40.556 --> 35:45.394
And how come when you and John need money
for the campaign, there's not a problem?

35:45.478 --> 35:47.480
Suddenly, I'm in trouble,
and now you're concerned?

35:47.563 --> 35:49.607
-I'm trying to help you.
-Are you trying to help me?

35:49.690 --> 35:51.025
Because I need this to happen.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.611
I don't want this. I need this.

35:53.694 --> 35:55.613
-I get it.
-I don't think you do.

35:58.574 --> 35:59.575
You know what?

36:01.118 --> 36:02.828
I think I'm starting to realize something.

36:02.912 --> 36:05.414
Now that Danny's gone,
and I'm starting to sober up,

36:05.498 --> 36:08.042
get my shit together a little bit,
I think you're scared.

36:08.125 --> 36:09.168
About what?

36:09.251 --> 36:11.212
There might not be a fuck-up
in the family anymore

36:11.295 --> 36:12.755
for you and John to feel superior to.

36:13.381 --> 36:14.799
Are you kidding me right now?

36:17.635 --> 36:20.137
-Number one, I am not John.
-Well...

36:20.304 --> 36:21.931
Number two,
it's a fucked-up thing to say.

36:22.014 --> 36:24.100
You're gonna have to go find
somebody else to save.

36:24.183 --> 36:28.020
Just make sure that they're a real failure
so that you can come in and rescue them.

36:30.606 --> 36:32.775
I'm not having this conversation with you.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.069
If you wanna do this, Kevin,
you go ahead and do it.

36:36.821 --> 36:37.738
The paperwork is fine.

36:37.822 --> 36:39.740
Okay. Well, thank you
for your legal advice,

36:39.824 --> 36:42.243
but if I need any more,
I'll be sure to look elsewhere.

37:21.198 --> 37:23.451
Your mama has a very pretty voice.

37:23.534 --> 37:24.702
I guess.

37:24.785 --> 37:26.287
He just hates it when I sing.

37:27.121 --> 37:28.998
How could you hate that?

37:29.331 --> 37:30.916
He used to like it.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.670
He wanted me to sing all the time
when he was a little boy.

37:36.005 --> 37:38.299
Yeah, okay. I'm going to bed.

37:39.341 --> 37:41.469
- You're leaving? Just like that?
- Yep.

37:46.724 --> 37:48.225
- Good night.
- Good night.

37:49.894 --> 37:53.814
Robert used to sing that song
for the kids, all the time.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.691
Yeah, I know.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.526
Danny told me.

37:58.027 --> 37:59.612
That's why I learned it.

38:01.697 --> 38:04.533
And Danny used to sing it to Nolan
when he was a baby.

38:06.827 --> 38:07.995
Danny couldn't sing.

38:10.122 --> 38:13.083
Yeah, but he did it anyway.

40:11.744 --> 40:14.371
Miss Ortiz, thank you very much
for seeing me again.

40:14.455 --> 40:15.497
I'm glad you called.

40:15.581 --> 40:18.876
I think it's very important
that we get your story out there.

40:19.335 --> 40:20.711
Please, come in.

41:05.422 --> 41:07.049
Clay, what was that all about?

41:07.132 --> 41:08.050
You didn't hear?

41:08.717 --> 41:11.595
Reporters got some dirt on Diaz
and IA is following up.

41:19.561 --> 41:22.898
It's our responsibility to inform you
we're opening up an investigation.

41:23.065 --> 41:26.360
Since when does IA take orders
from the local paper?

41:26.527 --> 41:30.447
A report like this has to be looked into.
You understand. It's a serious allegation.

41:31.490 --> 41:33.742
Do you understand that
that's all that this is?

41:33.909 --> 41:35.202
It's just an allegation.

41:35.285 --> 41:38.414
You'll get a chance to explain
your side of the story, Detective.

41:38.497 --> 41:40.332
If there's been no misconduct...

41:41.125 --> 41:42.626
you have nothing to worry about.

41:45.504 --> 41:47.131
No. No.

41:47.214 --> 41:49.675
No, no. I don't care
if it's Barbara fucking Walters,

41:49.842 --> 41:52.511
the answer's gonna be the same.
I'm not available for comment.

41:53.846 --> 41:55.514
There's gonna be an official inquiry.

41:55.973 --> 41:57.141
Shit.

41:58.267 --> 41:59.351
Rayburn.

42:00.602 --> 42:01.687
Probably.

42:01.979 --> 42:05.566
All right, first thing:
don't say a word to anyone.

42:05.733 --> 42:07.651
And call the union lawyer.

42:07.818 --> 42:09.278
It's only gonna be a matter of days

42:09.361 --> 42:11.655
before they start
sticking microscopes up our ass.

42:11.822 --> 42:13.157
What about the case?

42:13.240 --> 42:15.451
Full steam ahead.
Tell O'Bannon he's got immunity.

42:15.617 --> 42:18.495
-DA's gonna need more than that.
-Draw up the paperwork.

42:18.704 --> 42:21.540
If O'Bannon's got the goods,
I wanna be ready to roll.

42:27.504 --> 42:28.464
Listen, O'Bannon.

42:28.547 --> 42:31.175
I haven't heard back from you.
I think you're full of shit.

42:31.258 --> 42:34.678
You want immunity, you gotta give me
something before you run out of time.

42:34.762 --> 42:37.389
You know the number.
I'm waiting for your call, okay?

42:41.060 --> 42:42.186
<i>You want immunity,</i>

42:42.269 --> 42:44.313
<i>you gotta give me</i>
<i>something before you run out of time.</i>

42:44.396 --> 42:46.815
<i>You know the number.</i>
<i>I'm waiting for your call, okay?</i>

42:54.281 --> 42:55.908
You know, you better split.

42:56.784 --> 42:58.494
He's gonna be here soon.

42:59.912 --> 43:03.791
I'll get finished here with John,
and I'll swing by your place.

43:04.458 --> 43:05.501
See you, man.

43:10.589 --> 43:11.757
Good luck, bro.

43:18.347 --> 43:19.348
<i>Danny.</i>

43:23.602 --> 43:24.770
Danny.

43:31.110 --> 43:32.319
Dan-o.

44:10.607 --> 44:11.984
- Oh, hey, Mr. Gilbert.
- Hey,

44:12.067 --> 44:14.027
I thought I'd stop by
and check out my investment.

44:14.194 --> 44:15.821
Uh... Okay.

44:15.904 --> 44:18.657
If I still have an investment.

44:19.241 --> 44:21.660
Meg said she left the papers with you.

44:21.785 --> 44:25.122
-Yeah. Sorry about that. I got--
-Have you signed? We got a deal?

44:25.205 --> 44:28.959
-I can give you another day or two.
-No, no. No, I got them right here.

44:29.042 --> 44:32.337
-Uh-huh. Everything check out?
-Yeah.

44:33.630 --> 44:35.424
-No questions? Issues?
-No.

44:36.383 --> 44:38.010
No, not really.

44:38.594 --> 44:40.137
"Not really"?

44:41.180 --> 44:45.434
Is that the sound
of second thoughts I hear?

44:47.352 --> 44:48.437
Yeah. Just...

44:49.438 --> 44:51.398
Just me and you here, Kevin.

44:52.065 --> 44:56.236
No need beating around the buttonwood.
If you need more time to go over it...

44:58.280 --> 45:00.574
No, no. I don't need any more time.

45:00.824 --> 45:02.451
Oh. Okay, then.

45:06.872 --> 45:07.873
Yep.

45:12.294 --> 45:14.922
Got anything to drink around here
to toast our new partnership?

45:15.047 --> 45:16.423
Uh, actually, I don't drink,

45:16.506 --> 45:20.135
but I have a large assortment of juices
and sodas if...

45:20.302 --> 45:24.264
Well, we'll skip it, then.
We'll celebrate another time.

45:24.431 --> 45:26.600
-I'll take you and the wife out to dinner.
-Sounds good.

45:26.683 --> 45:29.311
-Yeah. You'll hear from me soon.
-Okay.

45:30.646 --> 45:31.480
Thank you.

45:32.731 --> 45:34.232
Thanks for coming down.

45:46.078 --> 45:48.413
-Oh, hey.
-Hm.

45:48.497 --> 45:49.498
Hey.

45:49.581 --> 45:51.166
Where the hell you been, huh?

45:54.044 --> 45:56.713
I was starting to think
that you'd forgotten all about me.

45:58.423 --> 46:00.258
I got a little surprise for you.

46:01.927 --> 46:03.637
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

46:09.309 --> 46:11.645
Holy shit. How much is this?

46:12.521 --> 46:16.358
I got a lot more back at the motel,
so why don't you say we go back,

46:16.441 --> 46:18.151
you and me, and roll in it?

46:22.197 --> 46:23.240
I can't.

46:24.533 --> 46:25.659
Why not?

46:28.370 --> 46:30.205
She invited me to stay.

46:31.498 --> 46:32.499
"She" who?

46:32.666 --> 46:34.710
Sally Rayburn.

46:36.837 --> 46:38.130
So, uh...

46:39.297 --> 46:41.425
me and Nolan are at the inn now.

46:43.010 --> 46:43.844
Like...

46:44.344 --> 46:45.387
Like you're living there?

46:47.014 --> 46:49.141
I don't know. We'll see.

46:51.560 --> 46:52.602
What happened?

46:54.771 --> 47:00.444
Uh, I think she realized she made
a mistake shutting me out, you know...

47:02.696 --> 47:06.408
and she's got a hole in her life
without Danny.

47:06.616 --> 47:10.120
Hm. Wow, you really worked that situation,
didn't you?

47:11.204 --> 47:13.248
I didn't work anything.

47:14.666 --> 47:16.126
They're my family.

47:17.878 --> 47:18.712
Yeah, but...

47:18.795 --> 47:20.172
But they're not.

47:36.188 --> 47:39.191
So, let me come and see it.
Let me come and check your situation.

47:42.194 --> 47:43.904
I can't screw this up.

47:49.701 --> 47:50.535
Hey.

47:52.037 --> 47:55.665
This thing between you and me
wasn't gonna last forever.

47:59.002 --> 48:00.003
You knew that.

48:00.962 --> 48:02.130
Yeah. Did I?

48:05.550 --> 48:08.637
It's crazy 'cause I'm the only one
who's ever really taken care of you.

48:10.263 --> 48:12.641
I mean, your parents didn't. Right?

48:12.724 --> 48:14.017
Danny didn't.

48:14.643 --> 48:16.353
And these people aren't gonna either.

48:18.021 --> 48:19.564
It's just me.

48:20.857 --> 48:22.776
Just me, really.

48:45.674 --> 48:48.552
I just don't think it's a good idea
for them to be living here.

48:48.635 --> 48:51.012
Well, you seemed okay with it earlier.

48:51.096 --> 48:54.099
You sprung it on me, Mom.
I didn't get time to think about it.

48:55.183 --> 48:59.187
Nolan's my grandson, your nephew.
It's a non-issue.

49:00.313 --> 49:02.023
Okay, but what about her, then?

49:02.274 --> 49:04.818
Mom, she came here begging us
for money.

49:04.901 --> 49:06.194
She's using you.

49:09.114 --> 49:11.950
I appreciate that you're trying
to fix things that happened in the past,

49:12.033 --> 49:13.994
but it's just not the right way to do it.

49:14.077 --> 49:16.705
Well, it's my way of doing it.

49:19.916 --> 49:21.877
She's not who you think she is.

49:23.378 --> 49:24.379
Who is she?

49:25.172 --> 49:28.133
You don't know what she does
or who she associates with.

49:28.800 --> 49:30.510
Who? Who does she associate with?

49:31.845 --> 49:33.305
I can't tell you that right now, Mom.

49:34.306 --> 49:37.100
God,
you sound like your brother John,

49:37.267 --> 49:39.227
telling me things
without telling me anything.

49:39.394 --> 49:41.855
I just don't want her
to be around this place, okay?

49:42.022 --> 49:44.649
-Well, it's not your decision.
-Well, it should be, Mom.

49:44.733 --> 49:46.276
-Oh, it should?
-Yeah.

49:47.736 --> 49:50.363
John and Kevin and I,
we all own part of this place, too.

49:50.447 --> 49:53.074
If you're gonna make a decision like that,
you should ask us.

49:54.826 --> 49:58.747
Did you and John and Kevin
build this from nothing?

49:59.122 --> 50:02.542
Did you raise five children
while trying to run a business, Meg?

50:02.626 --> 50:05.545
Did you almost have a fucking
nervous breakdown trying

50:05.629 --> 50:07.547
to make everybody else happy
but yourself?

50:07.631 --> 50:08.506
Mom...

50:09.758 --> 50:11.218
Did you?

50:11.885 --> 50:12.928
No.

50:13.011 --> 50:16.556
Then don't talk to me
about your rights here.

50:19.351 --> 50:24.272
I asked you to cut Danny back
into the business before he died.

50:25.774 --> 50:27.150
You didn't do it, did you?

50:31.446 --> 50:32.614
No.

50:35.659 --> 50:38.370
Mom, I don't know what she's up to,
but it's not good.

50:39.246 --> 50:42.249
Nolan and Eve
are not going anywhere.

50:58.306 --> 50:59.432
Hey, man.

50:59.516 --> 51:00.558
Good to see you.

51:07.607 --> 51:10.193
Do you really think
that IA bullshit's gonna scare me off?

51:11.069 --> 51:13.238
I don't know what to think.

51:14.823 --> 51:16.408
I know what you did.

51:17.325 --> 51:19.160
And you know what you did.

51:20.912 --> 51:21.997
Good night, Marco.

51:25.083 --> 51:27.502
You know,
if you keep going down this road...

51:29.129 --> 51:31.339
you're not gonna find what you think.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.550
It's not gonna end well for you.

51:38.305 --> 51:41.308
Well, then, it looks like
it's not gonna end well for either of us.

52:34.027 --> 52:35.695
What's going on here?

52:39.115 --> 52:40.784
What are you guys doing on the boat?

52:44.120 --> 52:45.413
You must be Kevin.

52:46.539 --> 52:47.624
My apologies.

52:48.083 --> 52:49.918
Didn't expect you to be here this late.

52:51.211 --> 52:52.629
Uh...

52:53.088 --> 52:54.089
Who the fuck are you?

52:54.964 --> 52:57.842
I'm Luis,
an old friend of Mr. Gilbert's.

52:58.676 --> 53:01.888
-Is there a problem, Luis?
-No, not at all.

53:01.971 --> 53:03.848
We just needed to take
the boat out for a bit.

53:03.932 --> 53:04.849
Nothing to worry about.

53:05.558 --> 53:07.227
Does Mr. Gilbert know about this?

53:07.769 --> 53:08.937
Of course.

53:10.522 --> 53:11.689
It's good to meet you.

53:12.315 --> 53:14.109
Look forward to seeing
more of each other.

56:17.208 --> 56:18.626
How can we work this out?

56:20.461 --> 56:22.255
I don't know, John.

56:38.396 --> 56:41.107
John? What happened?

56:41.190 --> 56:43.359
Oh, my God. Is that Danny?

57:01.502 --> 57:04.047
I'm gonna take John's car
to the hospital.

57:04.213 --> 57:05.632
Take Danny and go home.

58:16.327 --> 58:18.454
I wanna tell my story.
