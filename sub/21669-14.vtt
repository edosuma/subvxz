00:00.829 --> 00:02.656
<i>(Male announcer) Previously,
on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.657 --> 00:05.097
(Gordon) It's the blue menu
versus the red menu.

00:05.098 --> 00:07.099
Your stations, your menu,
my standards.

00:07.100 --> 00:09.902
(Announcer) As the red team
prepped for dinner service...

00:09.903 --> 00:11.437
<i>(Dana) What is she even doing with
two hours for these mussels?</i>

00:11.438 --> 00:13.005
Two and a half hours now.

00:13.006 --> 00:16.241
(Announcer) The chefs had a problem
with Barbie's attention to detail.

00:16.242 --> 00:18.010
Barbie, I'm a lot
bigger than you,

00:18.011 --> 00:19.478
and I'm moving 10 times
faster than you.

00:19.479 --> 00:21.614
(Announcer) But once
dinner service started...

00:21.615 --> 00:24.650
You're preparing
fresh garnish in a dirty pan!

00:24.651 --> 00:27.086
(Announcer) It was
Tiffany's carelessness...

00:27.087 --> 00:28.921
Oh, my God, are you kidding me?

00:28.922 --> 00:30.589
(Announcer) That
infuriated chef Ramsay.

00:30.590 --> 00:32.256
Why can't you get clean pans

00:32.258 --> 00:33.993
when they're standing
in front of you?

00:33.994 --> 00:35.861
(Announcer)
And the sous chef Andi...

00:35.862 --> 00:37.329
You have such
a [bleep] attitude.

00:37.330 --> 00:37.963
Why don't you take a walk?

00:37.964 --> 00:40.199
Have fun.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.934
(Announcer)
In the blue kitchen...

00:41.935 --> 00:43.469
It's one and then two,
one and then two.

00:43.470 --> 00:44.637
I just told ya.
Two, and then two.

00:44.638 --> 00:46.138
It's two...

00:46.139 --> 00:47.773
(announcer) Clemenza was
completely flustered.

00:47.774 --> 00:48.874
I have the other sea bass.

00:48.875 --> 00:50.075
You lying bastard.

00:50.076 --> 00:51.443
I will nail you to the post.

00:51.444 --> 00:52.745
(Announcer)
...And Robyn...

00:52.746 --> 00:53.646
Just touch that.
Just touch it.

00:53.647 --> 00:55.214
Mushy.

00:55.215 --> 00:57.082
(Announcer) Couldn't
figure out Justin's dish.

00:57.083 --> 00:58.050
Are you blaming me for that?

00:58.051 --> 00:59.018
I am kind of blaming you, bro.

00:59.019 --> 01:00.819
You set me up for failure.

01:00.820 --> 01:02.421
(Announcer) And on a night when they
were cooking their own menus...

01:02.422 --> 01:03.422
Stop! All of you!

01:03.423 --> 01:05.090
The red team...

01:06.793 --> 01:07.459
and the blue team...

01:07.460 --> 01:09.294
All of you, come here!

01:09.295 --> 01:11.063
Struggled throughout
dinner service.

01:11.064 --> 01:14.833
Every table... stop, start.
Stop, start.

01:14.834 --> 01:17.102
Stop, start, stop, start!

01:17.103 --> 01:18.904
Get out.

01:18.905 --> 01:24.443
Tonight was the most shocking
dinner service yet.

01:24.444 --> 01:26.779
There will be no winning team.

01:26.780 --> 01:28.580
(Announcer)
During deliberations...

01:28.581 --> 01:29.615
You [bleep] set me up
for failure, bro.

01:29.616 --> 01:30.816
And ask for help.

01:30.817 --> 01:32.751
<i>And I asked you for [bleep]
help, and you denied it.</i>

01:32.752 --> 01:35.354
Robyn was in the middle
of the drama once again.

01:35.355 --> 01:37.322
<i>(Justin) Robyn cannot
take responsibility</i>

01:37.323 --> 01:38.624
for herself at all,
she's a child.

01:38.625 --> 01:39.958
(Announcer) In the end, the
blue team nominated...

01:39.959 --> 01:41.007
Robyn.

01:41.008 --> 01:42.107
And...
Clemenza.

01:42.108 --> 01:43.609
The red team nominated...
Barbie.

01:43.610 --> 01:44.496
And...
Tiffany, chef.

01:44.497 --> 01:46.031
I love Tiffany to death.

01:46.032 --> 01:47.866
<i>It's really hard
to see her up there.</i>

01:47.867 --> 01:49.635
(Announcer) But even after
a passionate plea...

01:49.636 --> 01:51.270
<i>(Tiffany) I feel so bad.</i>

01:51.271 --> 01:52.871
I just want to prove
to you that I can do it.

01:52.872 --> 01:53.939
Tiffany...

01:53.940 --> 01:55.074
Please give me your jacket.

01:55.075 --> 01:55.874
Was sent packing.

01:55.875 --> 01:57.242
Good night.

01:57.243 --> 01:59.178
Thus ending her dream
of becoming head chef

01:59.179 --> 02:02.114
at Gordon Ramsay's Steak
at Paris, Las Vegas.

03:05.337 --> 03:07.780
Get out of here.
(All) Yes, chef.

03:07.781 --> 03:10.282
<i>(Barbie) Tiffany went home
'cause she needed to.</i>

03:10.283 --> 03:13.685
One by one, they're dropping
like flies, and I'm still here.

03:13.686 --> 03:17.623
[Sobbing]

03:17.624 --> 03:19.758
It sucks that
my best friend just left.

03:19.759 --> 03:23.262
Tiffany. That's my girl, dude.
Straight up.

03:23.263 --> 03:24.730
Oh, this is so difficult.

03:24.731 --> 03:27.366
That was my dude, man.

03:27.367 --> 03:29.201
I know, it sucks.
It sucks.

03:29.202 --> 03:33.272
She helps me so much.
You all just don't even know.

03:35.875 --> 03:37.876
(Kimmie) Tiff should
not have gone home.

03:37.877 --> 03:39.678
It should've totally
been Barbie's funky ass,

03:39.679 --> 03:41.413
because she is not
a team player.

03:41.414 --> 03:44.550
But now I gotta
bang it out for Tiff.

03:44.551 --> 03:45.951
I'm gonna get
that bitch outta here.

03:45.952 --> 03:47.352
Barbie's gonna be gone.

03:47.353 --> 03:50.422
I'm gonna beat
this bitch's ass, dude.

03:50.423 --> 03:51.490
I know, I hear ya.

03:51.491 --> 03:53.258
Now that Tiffany's gone,

03:53.259 --> 03:56.228
I feel like things are square
between Kimmie and I.

03:56.229 --> 03:58.297
She's definitely not happy
that Barbie's still here.

03:58.298 --> 04:01.033
I'm just glad
that it's not really me.

04:01.034 --> 04:02.901
But let them deal with it.

04:02.902 --> 04:04.736
I'm not on [bleep] red team.
I don't give a [bleep] anymore.

04:04.737 --> 04:05.237
I care about myself
and the blue team.

04:05.238 --> 04:06.171
<i>For real, Kimmie.</i>

04:06.172 --> 04:07.606

04:07.607 --> 04:09.041
<i>Oh, yeah.
I'm here to win.</i>

04:09.042 --> 04:10.375
I'm about to take
the reins of this team,

04:10.376 --> 04:12.411
<i>whether they like it or not.</i>

04:15.048 --> 04:17.149
(Announcer) After a
tumultuous dinner service,

04:17.149 --> 04:18.784
the chefs are more
anxious than ever...

04:18.785 --> 04:20.285
Let's do this.

04:20.286 --> 04:22.554
To see what chef Ramsay
has in store for them today.

04:22.555 --> 04:25.424
Oh, [bleep].

04:25.425 --> 04:27.159
I see this giant map.

04:27.160 --> 04:30.128
<i>California's got avocados,
Texas has got some ribs,</i>

04:30.129 --> 04:31.864
Idaho's got potatoes...

04:31.865 --> 04:33.699
Something's gonna happen.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.534
I don't know what, but I know
something's gonna happen.

04:35.535 --> 04:37.402
I had the pleasure
of traveling across

04:37.403 --> 04:38.937
<i>the United States,</i>

04:38.938 --> 04:41.139
and through my travels,
I've been able to see.

04:41.140 --> 04:44.576
<i>Maine lobster, Maryland crab,
Wisconsin cheese... delicious.</i>

04:44.577 --> 04:46.712
Clearly, each region
has a state cuisine.

04:46.713 --> 04:49.481
And our next challenge
is all about

04:49.482 --> 04:51.016
an American cuisine

04:51.017 --> 04:53.457
<i>that I've learned
to love in a big way.</i>

04:53.458 --> 04:55.520
And that is...
Southern cuisine!

04:55.521 --> 04:57.356
<i>(Kimmie) Yeah.</i>

04:57.357 --> 04:58.757

And the St. James
Southern Voices of Victory.

05:43.536 --> 05:45.003
Kimmie, you look at home.

05:45.004 --> 05:47.372
Oh, that was so
at home right there.

05:47.373 --> 05:50.075
I asked this lovely
group here today.

05:50.076 --> 05:51.276
<i>Because gospel music</i>

05:51.277 --> 05:52.811
has its roots in the South,

05:52.812 --> 05:55.414
<i>and today, each of you
will be reinventing</i>

05:55.415 --> 05:57.449
a classic Southern dish.

05:57.450 --> 05:59.618
(Dana) I'm a little worried,

05:59.619 --> 06:01.987
'cause Southern cooking
isn't really my style.

06:01.988 --> 06:03.822
<i>(Kimmie)
Yee-how!</i>

06:03.823 --> 06:07.092
(Dana) But I got Kimmie next
to me, like, going crazy.

06:07.093 --> 06:10.195
Maybe this is Kimmie's time
to carry the team.

06:10.196 --> 06:11.330
Now...

06:11.331 --> 06:13.165
<i>As you can see,
our wonderful choir</i>

06:13.166 --> 06:16.134
<i>are holding fans

06:16.135 --> 06:18.070
<i>We have blue fans,

06:18.071 --> 06:20.572
<i>a Southern entree
on the other side of that fan.</i>

06:20.573 --> 06:24.276
<i>And purple fans have
a Southern side dish.</i>

06:24.277 --> 06:25.277
Clear?

06:25.278 --> 06:27.245
(All) Yes, chef.

06:27.246 --> 06:28.847
<i>Barbie, who would you

<i>in the blue team?</i>

<i>(Kimmie) Come on, Barbie.</i>

06:33.519 --> 06:35.220
(Barbie) Clemenza is
definitely a competitor.

06:35.221 --> 06:37.089
He's been strong
during the challenges,

06:37.090 --> 06:39.157
and I want to prove it
to myself and to chef

06:39.158 --> 06:41.727
that I can take down Clemenza.

06:41.728 --> 06:43.495

(Clemenza) What the [bleep]
is collard greens?

07:04.450 --> 07:06.218
I'm baffled
at this point in time.

07:06.219 --> 07:09.621
In New York, we don't have
collard greens.

07:09.622 --> 07:11.623
Brian, who would you like
to go against on the red team?

07:11.624 --> 07:12.791

08:02.141 --> 08:04.076
Oh, [bleep],
that would've been nice.

08:04.077 --> 08:05.544
Thank you very much.
Thank you, guys.

08:05.545 --> 08:06.778
Okay.

08:06.779 --> 08:08.146
(Announcer)
Up last are Dana and Robyn.

08:08.147 --> 08:09.514
Off you go.

08:09.515 --> 08:10.782
(Announcer)
Their entree will be...

08:10.783 --> 08:13.418
♪ Meatloaf ♪

08:13.419 --> 08:16.822

08:24.664 --> 08:25.897
<i>Well done.</i>

08:25.898 --> 08:28.233
Thank you so much.
Amazing.

08:28.234 --> 08:29.401
Thank you so much.
Brought me home.

08:29.402 --> 08:30.769
<i>Okay.</i>

08:30.770 --> 08:33.672
It's now time for
the Southern cuisine battle.

08:33.673 --> 08:37.576
You will have 30 minutes,
and your time starts...

08:37.577 --> 08:39.177
Now...Off you go.

08:39.178 --> 08:41.246
(Announcer) In the Southern
cuisine challenge,

08:41.246 --> 08:44.382
chef Ramsay is giving
the chefs 30 minutes

08:44.383 --> 08:47.018
to reinvent a classic
Southern entree and side.

08:47.019 --> 08:48.587
♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪

08:48.588 --> 08:50.455
Oh, I wanna do a hushpuppy.

08:50.456 --> 08:52.157
(Announcer) He's looking
for Southern flair...

08:52.158 --> 08:53.458
Any chili powder?

08:53.459 --> 08:54.459
Oh, there's your
cajun seasoning.

08:54.460 --> 08:55.594
Yeah.

08:55.595 --> 08:57.362
With fine-dining finesse.

08:57.363 --> 08:59.064
Kiss my grits.

08:59.065 --> 09:00.432
All right, ladies,
let's bust it out.

09:00.433 --> 09:02.200
Ma, the meatloaf!

09:02.201 --> 09:04.202
I don't know how
I'm gonna reinvent meatloaf,

09:04.203 --> 09:06.738
but I better figure it out
real damn quick.

09:06.739 --> 09:08.173
Stupid meatloaf.

09:08.174 --> 09:09.608
Is the fryer on?
Clemenza?

09:09.609 --> 09:11.143
Yes.

09:11.144 --> 09:13.812
Don't hate on me for breaking
down this chicken like [bleep].

09:13.813 --> 09:15.881
I never, ever make fried
chicken, ever, ever, ever.

09:15.882 --> 09:17.215
I definitely have
my work cut out for me.

09:17.216 --> 09:18.917
Anybody have any ideas for me?

09:18.918 --> 09:20.819
(Announcer)
While Justin pounds away,

09:20.820 --> 09:22.787
contemplating what to do
with his chicken,

09:22.788 --> 09:24.389
over in the red kitchen,

09:24.390 --> 09:26.725
Christina is considering
her options as well.

09:26.726 --> 09:28.593
I don't know if I should
go skin-on or skin-off.

09:28.594 --> 09:29.895
Skin-on, dude.
It'll be crispier, no?

09:29.896 --> 09:31.329
<i>Yeah.</i>

09:31.330 --> 09:33.632
I'm indecisive about
leaving the skin on the chicken.

09:33.633 --> 09:35.901
Typically, I would leave it on,
but then I'm thinking,

09:35.902 --> 09:37.936
okay,
the amount of time I have,

09:37.937 --> 09:39.271
is it gonna crisp up
in the fryer?

09:39.272 --> 09:41.106
I'm not real sure.

09:41.107 --> 09:42.574
Did you put an egg in it?

09:42.575 --> 09:45.210
In the fry... in the batter?
Yeah.

09:45.211 --> 09:48.280
How many times have I ever
[bleep] cooked grits? Zero.

09:48.281 --> 09:50.815
I've never made grits.
I don't know how to make them.

09:50.816 --> 09:52.083
So I'm reading the box.

09:52.084 --> 09:54.319
Three cups...
Four cups...

09:54.320 --> 09:57.889
I don't even... this is...
some of this is in French.

09:57.890 --> 10:00.292
Um, I don't understand.

10:00.293 --> 10:03.061
Oh, you better
get those on, bro.

10:03.062 --> 10:05.130
Oh, I'm gonna get
murdered on these grits.

10:05.131 --> 10:06.464
Come on, Kimmie,
this should be you.

10:06.465 --> 10:07.699
Yes, chef.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.768
I have to shine
on this challenge.

10:09.769 --> 10:10.802
I have to.

10:10.803 --> 10:11.836
90 seconds to go.

10:11.837 --> 10:12.938
(All) Yes, chef.

10:12.939 --> 10:14.272
Okay, it's time to go.

10:14.273 --> 10:15.840
Please cook.

10:15.841 --> 10:18.376
Robyn, make it count.

10:18.377 --> 10:20.745
I know chef Ramsay... He always
says I don't use enough spices.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.581
So I decide I'm gonna put
some nutmeg in there,

10:22.582 --> 10:23.582
some cinnamon...

10:23.583 --> 10:25.250
I need salt.

10:25.251 --> 10:27.886
And, of course I put the salt
in there. I want to taste it.

10:27.887 --> 10:28.887
30 seconds to go.

10:28.888 --> 10:31.089
Yes, chef.
Damn.

10:31.090 --> 10:33.992
I dropped my skin off.

10:33.993 --> 10:35.660
I'm shaking so bad
that I'm, like,

10:35.661 --> 10:36.761
knocking skin
off of the chicken.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.230
<i>I just hope
that I didn't ruin it.</i>

10:38.231 --> 10:40.098
<i>Christina.
Yes, chef. I'm coming.</i>

10:40.099 --> 10:43.969
<i>(Gordon)
Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

10:43.970 --> 10:46.905
And serve.

10:46.906 --> 10:50.008
To judge this challenge,

10:50.009 --> 10:51.843
I've invited
the editor and chief

10:51.844 --> 10:54.112
<i>of the most
critically-acclaimed food site</i>

10:54.113 --> 10:56.348
on the Internet.

10:56.349 --> 11:00.452
Please welcome Tanya Steel
from Epicurious.

11:00.453 --> 11:05.624
What? That's crazy.
Like, Epicurious is huge.

11:05.625 --> 11:08.393
I'm like, how many forks
is she gonna give my dish?

11:08.394 --> 11:10.395
Let's start off
with Clemenza...

11:10.396 --> 11:12.430
<i>Yes, chef.
And Barbie. Let's go.</i>

11:12.431 --> 11:14.833
Come on, Barbie.
Come on, Clemenza.

11:14.834 --> 11:17.068
(Announcer) Barbie and Clemenza lead
off the Southern cuisine challenge

11:17.069 --> 11:19.504
with their take on catfish
and collard greens.

11:19.505 --> 11:21.439
<i>(Barbie)
I did blackened catfish</i>

11:21.440 --> 11:25.644
with bacon-braised
collard greens.

11:25.645 --> 11:27.245
Visually, I think
it's very attractive.

11:27.246 --> 11:28.213
And this is beautifully fried.

11:28.214 --> 11:29.281
Thank you.

11:29.282 --> 11:31.216
Great start.
Well done, Barbie.

11:31.217 --> 11:33.551
[Bleep]. You know, she's getting
some good compliments here.

11:33.552 --> 11:34.653
Now I'm a little worried.

11:34.654 --> 11:36.254
Clemenza, please.

11:36.255 --> 11:38.089
<i>(Clemenza) We have New
York-style catfish poor boy,</i>

11:38.090 --> 11:41.126
also some bacon-braised
collard greens.

11:41.127 --> 11:42.894
<i>(Tanya) Collard greens
are very nice.</i>

11:42.895 --> 11:44.796
The bacon really comes through.

11:44.797 --> 11:47.232
Catfish, I think, could've been
cooked a little bit more.

11:47.233 --> 11:49.401
It's a little bit undercooked.

11:49.402 --> 11:52.337
Really? I looked at it, I didn't
see what she was saying.

11:52.338 --> 11:54.272
<i>She should've had
an orgasm in her mouth.</i>

11:54.273 --> 11:55.407
'Cause that was
a beautiful sandwich.

11:55.408 --> 11:56.508
<i>(Gordon) Was there one
dish in your mind</i>

11:56.509 --> 11:57.876
that has an advantage?

11:57.877 --> 11:59.644
Barbie's dish.

11:59.645 --> 12:01.079
Yeah, Barbie.
Barbie.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.347
Congratulations.
One-nil, to the ladies.

12:02.348 --> 12:03.682
<i>(Barbie) Yes!</i>

12:03.683 --> 12:05.850
I got a point for the red team!

12:05.851 --> 12:08.353
<i>And I beat Clemenza.</i>

12:08.354 --> 12:09.354
Whoo-hoo.

12:09.355 --> 12:10.588
Next up, pork chop.

12:10.589 --> 12:12.157
Kimmie and Brian, let's go.

12:12.158 --> 12:14.192
(Kimmie) I got a
bangin'-ass plate, man.

12:14.193 --> 12:15.960
I know Brian's about to
go down with my plate.

12:15.961 --> 12:17.195
Uh!

12:17.196 --> 12:19.998
I have an oregano,
panko-crusted pork chop.

12:19.999 --> 12:22.534
<i>The grits have cream,
sauteed bacon...</i>

12:22.535 --> 12:23.868
Mm.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.603
Monterey Jack cheese,
and Swiss cheese as well.

12:25.604 --> 12:26.671
Oh, my God.
Wow.

12:26.672 --> 12:28.139
<i>Sounds incredible.</i>

12:28.140 --> 12:30.342
But, I mean, visually,
looks slightly dull,

12:30.343 --> 12:32.177
anything else that
came to mind, or...?

12:32.178 --> 12:34.312
No, I just... that's how
we eat it back home.

12:34.313 --> 12:35.947
Of course, chef Ramsay always

12:35.948 --> 12:37.649
gives me criticism
on my plating.

12:37.650 --> 12:39.351
Dude, just taste
the [bleep] [bleep].

12:39.352 --> 12:40.352
Wow.

12:40.353 --> 12:41.820
The grits are delicious.

12:41.821 --> 12:43.421
<i>One of the best grits
I've ever had.</i>

12:43.422 --> 12:45.056
I could eat
just buckets full of that.

12:45.057 --> 12:45.990
<i>(Gordon) Pops in the mouth.</i>

12:45.991 --> 12:47.258
(Brian)
They loved Kimmie's dish.

12:47.259 --> 12:49.260
So I've got my work
cut out for me.

12:49.261 --> 12:50.862
Brian, please.

12:50.863 --> 12:52.931
What we have here is a Southern
rubbed bone-in pork chop.

12:52.932 --> 12:56.568
<i>It's on top of buttermilk,
brown sugar grits.</i>

12:56.569 --> 12:59.003
That's a very beautiful plate.

12:59.004 --> 13:00.972
It just looks so appetizing.

13:00.973 --> 13:02.741
Okay...
Oh, my God.

13:02.742 --> 13:05.043
<i>Undercooked.</i>

13:05.044 --> 13:06.177
Damn. What a shame.

13:06.178 --> 13:08.313
<i>Please don't eat that.</i>

13:08.314 --> 13:09.748
You cannot serve raw pork.

13:09.749 --> 13:12.350
[Sighs]

13:12.351 --> 13:14.252
I almost honestly
thought of grabbing the plate

13:14.253 --> 13:15.687
and throwing it
against the wall.

13:15.688 --> 13:18.323
<i>I'm so ashamed
of what I put up there.</i>

13:18.324 --> 13:20.892
Um, Tanya, I think I know
which way you're going.

13:20.893 --> 13:22.026
Yeah. Kimmie.

13:22.027 --> 13:23.328
Good job, Kimmie.

13:23.329 --> 13:25.764
Good job, Kimmie.

13:25.765 --> 13:27.599
Kimmie, you made grits
glamorous. Well done.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.666
Thank you, chef.

13:28.667 --> 13:30.435
Everybody loves my grits.

13:30.436 --> 13:31.803
They're just amazing, like,
how can you say no to grits

13:31.804 --> 13:35.006
from a Southern bitch?

13:35.007 --> 13:37.041
(Announcer)
With the red team up 2-0...

13:37.042 --> 13:38.710
Next up, the battle
of the fried chicken. Let's go.

13:38.711 --> 13:41.913
Christina has a chance
to clinch the victory.

13:41.914 --> 13:44.082
I made a bacon gravy
mac and cheese,

13:44.083 --> 13:46.151
<i>and then a little fried
kale chip on top.</i>

13:46.152 --> 13:48.052
What happened with the batter?

13:48.053 --> 13:49.687
<i>(Gordon) The batter's soggy.
What a shame.</i>

13:49.688 --> 13:50.955
'Cause you think
of fried chicken,

13:50.956 --> 13:52.690
you think of the coating.
Exactly.

13:52.691 --> 13:55.593
But her soggy chicken
leaves an opening

13:55.594 --> 13:57.228
for Justin's
buttermilk fried chicken

13:57.229 --> 13:59.063
with lobster mac and cheese.

13:59.064 --> 14:01.266
Mm.
Mm.

14:01.267 --> 14:03.535
Wow.
Wow, wow, wow.

14:03.536 --> 14:06.271
That mac and cheese
is beautiful.

14:06.272 --> 14:07.739
Red or blue?
I think Justin.

14:07.740 --> 14:09.140
<i>Blue.
Thank you very much.</i>

14:09.141 --> 14:10.942
<i>Good job.</i>

14:10.943 --> 14:13.445
(Announcer) Justin's tasteful dish
keeps the blue team in the game.

14:13.446 --> 14:14.512
2-1.

14:14.513 --> 14:16.381
Last battle.
It is the meatloaf.

14:16.382 --> 14:18.550
(Announcer) With the red
team leading by one,

14:18.551 --> 14:21.719
Robyn must get the point
over Dana to force a tiebreaker.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.988
<i>(Robyn) I have an open-faced
meatloaf sandwich.</i>

14:23.989 --> 14:26.691
<i>I also made
a sweet potato puree.</i>

14:26.692 --> 14:28.193
The nutmeg really
comes out in this. Yummy.

14:28.194 --> 14:29.294
Thank you.

14:29.295 --> 14:30.495
Yes!

14:30.496 --> 14:31.830
<i>Didn't think I had that in me.</i>

14:31.831 --> 14:34.566
Mm.

14:34.567 --> 14:36.534
I've got a huge hit
of salt, though.

14:36.535 --> 14:39.471
I need salt.

14:39.472 --> 14:41.206
And it's a shame,
because it looks fantastic.

14:41.207 --> 14:42.240
Sorry, chef.

14:42.241 --> 14:43.441
Damn, dude.

14:43.442 --> 14:45.643
<i>Hopefully Dana's dish sucks.</i>

14:45.644 --> 14:47.445
<i>(Gordon) Dana, please.</i>

14:47.446 --> 14:49.380
What I have for you is
a bacon-wrapped mini meatloaf.

14:49.381 --> 14:52.550
<i>You have
the sweet potato puree,</i>

14:52.551 --> 14:54.686
and a little bit of honey
for some sweetness.

14:54.687 --> 14:55.854
Visually, I mean, it's a very
posh-looking meatloaf.

14:55.855 --> 14:56.855
It is very posh.

14:56.856 --> 14:58.022
[Laughs]

14:58.023 --> 14:59.958
<i>(Robyn)
Doesn't look posh to me.</i>

14:59.959 --> 15:01.745
It looks like two balls
wrapped in [bleep] bacon.

15:03.229 --> 15:06.965
Oh, my God, that puree
is so incredibly good.

15:06.966 --> 15:09.067
(Dana)
I know I'm getting the point.

15:09.068 --> 15:12.136
That meatloaf sandwich ain't got
nothing on my mini meatloaves.

15:12.137 --> 15:14.939
I can taste the meat.
A little overpowering.

15:14.940 --> 15:16.341
A touch too much lamb in there.

15:16.342 --> 15:17.442
<i>Slightly gamy, isn't it?</i>

15:17.443 --> 15:18.910
Red or blue?

15:18.911 --> 15:20.879
<i>Bearing in mind,
if it's blue, it's a draw.</i>

15:20.880 --> 15:22.447
<i>We go to the strongest
dish in each team.</i>

15:22.448 --> 15:23.982
<i>If it's red, they win 3-1.</i>

15:23.983 --> 15:26.251
Oh, wow. It's down to you.
Please.

15:26.252 --> 15:29.787
<i>(Tanya) Boy, this
is kind of hard.</i>

(Announcer) In today's
Southern cuisine challenge,

15:40.552 --> 15:41.986
the red team is up by one.

15:41.987 --> 15:43.821
Boy, this is kind of hard.

15:43.822 --> 15:47.024
A point for Robyn's meatloaf
sandwich will force a tie,

15:47.025 --> 15:50.094
but a win for Dana's
mini meatloaves

15:50.095 --> 15:51.596
will clinch the victory
for the red team.

15:51.597 --> 15:53.131
[Sighs]

15:53.132 --> 15:55.767
<i>I have to go with my heart.</i>

15:55.768 --> 15:56.968
Red.

15:56.969 --> 15:58.970
Yes!

15:58.971 --> 16:00.004
Ladies, congratulations.

16:00.005 --> 16:01.305
(Dana) Yeah!

16:01.306 --> 16:04.108
We finally won
a [bleep] reward!

16:04.109 --> 16:05.943
We are off
of our losing streak!

16:05.944 --> 16:08.179
We are off!

16:08.180 --> 16:09.180
Tanya...

16:09.181 --> 16:10.815
<i>From the winning team,</i>

16:10.816 --> 16:14.786
which dish sticks out
in your mind as the best?

16:14.787 --> 16:16.721
I have to say, I think
I'm gonna go with the meatballs.

16:16.722 --> 16:19.824
<i>(Gordon) Congratulations, Dana.</i>

16:19.825 --> 16:22.059
Your recipe and dish is gonna
be featured on Epicurious.

16:22.060 --> 16:23.961
Oh, my God.

16:23.962 --> 16:26.798
<i>And that is the most visited
food site on the Internet.</i>

16:26.799 --> 16:27.965
Nice job, Dana.

16:27.966 --> 16:31.135
[Imitates gunshots]

16:31.136 --> 16:32.737
It sucks. I was so close.

16:32.738 --> 16:34.639
Red te, because you've
won the challenge,

16:34.640 --> 16:36.974
<i>you're also going to
participate in a photo shoot</i>

16:36.975 --> 16:38.209
<i>with me and Tanya.</i>

16:38.210 --> 16:39.243
[Laughter]

16:39.244 --> 16:41.012
<i>After the photo shoot,</i>

16:41.013 --> 16:42.537
you'll be having
the most amazing lunch

16:42.538 --> 16:45.016
at the beautiful Four Seasons
in Beverly Hills.

16:45.017 --> 16:47.618
Aah!
Wow.

16:47.619 --> 16:49.520
We're going
to Beverly Hills for lunch.

16:49.521 --> 16:52.723
I'm so excited.
I'm hungry. I'm so hungry.

16:52.724 --> 16:54.016
<i>(Gordon) Tanya, thank
you, my darling.</i>

16:54.017 --> 16:54.938
Thank you so much.

16:54.939 --> 16:57.258
See you at the photo shoot.
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

16:58.564 --> 16:59.897
<i>Ladies...</i>

16:59.898 --> 17:02.266
Prepare to get pampered, because
I have photographers arriving.

17:02.267 --> 17:03.534
Get upstairs, and get changed.

17:03.535 --> 17:04.435
<i>Yeah, let's go.</i>

17:04.435 --> 17:05.269
<i>(Kimmie) Thank you, chef.</i>

17:05.270 --> 17:08.005
Yeah!

17:08.006 --> 17:09.507
Whoo!

17:09.508 --> 17:10.708
<i>Blue team...</i>

17:10.709 --> 17:12.108
Your day will not be so easy.

17:12.109 --> 17:13.377
You'll be prepping
both kitchens

17:13.377 --> 17:16.113
ahead of tonight's
dinner service.

17:16.114 --> 17:17.582
<i>And it's not
an ordinary service.</i>

17:17.583 --> 17:20.518
It's an entire new menu.

17:20.519 --> 17:23.954
A fine-dining take
on Southern cuisine.

17:23.955 --> 17:26.190
Also, we're making fresh bread,

17:26.191 --> 17:28.326
and hand-churning butter.

17:28.327 --> 17:30.561
Oh, no. I really honestly don't
want to [bleep] do punishment.

17:30.562 --> 17:32.230
You churn the butter,
I'll eat the butter.

17:32.231 --> 17:34.165
You know what I'm saying?

17:34.166 --> 17:36.133
Everybody grab a churn,
grab a stool,

17:36.134 --> 17:38.035
grab some cream,
and start churning.

17:38.036 --> 17:41.005
<i>(Robyn)
Ugh, making butter by hand.</i>

17:41.006 --> 17:43.741
You need to get this clay pot,
and pour some milk in there,

17:43.742 --> 17:45.476
<i>and move this stick
up and down.</i>

17:45.477 --> 17:46.744
[Imitates squishing]

17:46.745 --> 17:48.279
<i>And it takes, like, forever.</i>

17:48.280 --> 17:49.647
I feel like the [bleep] Amish.

17:49.648 --> 17:51.315
We are Amish right now.

17:51.316 --> 17:52.683
Bye, guys.

17:52.684 --> 17:54.485
<i>Oh, my God, they're making
them churn butter.</i>

17:54.486 --> 17:56.621
<i>(Clemenza)
Check you ladies out.</i>

17:56.622 --> 17:59.857
The red team cleans up pretty
nice; They were looking good.

17:59.858 --> 18:01.526
Come on.

18:01.527 --> 18:04.295
(Announcer) While the blue
team churns up a sweat...

18:04.296 --> 18:06.130
<i>(Justin)
Push, guys, come on, push.</i>

18:06.131 --> 18:08.666
The red team gets ready
for their close-up.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.568
(Dana) I am so ready

18:10.569 --> 18:13.704
to finally get a little
glammed up in Hell's Kitchen.

18:13.705 --> 18:14.972
Feels good to be winning again.

18:14.973 --> 18:16.641
Oh, my God.

18:16.642 --> 18:18.109
I'm a total tomboy.

18:18.110 --> 18:20.144
I don't wear makeup,
I don't do my hair.

18:20.145 --> 18:21.379
I don't need it.

18:21.380 --> 18:23.080
I have natural beauty.

18:23.081 --> 18:24.916
I don't need this [bleep]
glob of [bleep] on my face.

18:24.917 --> 18:26.884
But what the [bleep].
I'll do it.

18:26.885 --> 18:28.419
Holy mackerel.
Look at this.

18:28.420 --> 18:30.054
Don't they look amazing?

18:30.055 --> 18:31.255
<i>Like Charlie's Angels
from the catering world.</i>

18:31.256 --> 18:32.390
[Laughter]

18:32.391 --> 18:33.524
<i>Kimmie, you look great.</i>

18:33.525 --> 18:34.625
<i>Thanks, chef.</i>

18:34.626 --> 18:35.793
Everybody just look at me.

18:35.794 --> 18:37.361
<i>Big smiles, everybody.</i>

18:37.362 --> 18:38.996
Look at Dana's face.

18:38.997 --> 18:40.464
<i>Like she just found
a boyfriend for the first time.</i>

18:40.465 --> 18:43.668
[Laughter]

18:43.669 --> 18:45.136
The photo shoot
was a lot of fun with chef.

18:45.137 --> 18:46.604
He's really funny.

18:46.605 --> 18:48.940
He kept us laughing so we were
all smiles for the camera.

18:48.941 --> 18:50.441
Awesome.

18:50.442 --> 18:52.877
(All) Bye, guys!

18:52.878 --> 18:54.378
(Dana) Make some yummy butter!

18:54.379 --> 18:56.814
It's time to roll out.

18:56.815 --> 18:59.450
(Announcer) While the red team heads off
to the second part of their reward,

18:59.451 --> 19:01.052
the blue team...

19:01.053 --> 19:02.653
Churning it [bleep] fast,
so we can get out the butter.

19:02.654 --> 19:04.088
Is still laboring

19:04.089 --> 19:06.357
over the first part
of their punishment.

19:06.358 --> 19:07.925
If you lift the stick up,

19:07.926 --> 19:09.293
you'll feel it getting
heavier and heavier.

19:09.294 --> 19:10.261
Yeah, I feel it getting hard.

19:10.262 --> 19:12.263
I'm almost there.
Come on, don't stop.+

19:12.264 --> 19:14.365
(Justin) I'll never churn
my own butter ever again.

19:14.366 --> 19:16.901
It is the worst thing
in the world. It sucks.

19:16.902 --> 19:19.003
Every inch of your arm hurts,

19:19.004 --> 19:20.137
and that's why
people don't do it.

19:20.138 --> 19:21.706
[Grunts]

19:21.707 --> 19:24.508
I am butter.

19:24.509 --> 19:27.878
<i>We got a lot more
butter coming.</i>

19:27.879 --> 19:29.880
Butter, butter, we love butter.

19:29.881 --> 19:31.015
Oh, thank you.

19:31.016 --> 19:32.583
Oh, ho-ho.
That looks so good.

19:32.584 --> 19:34.151
Let's dig in, ladies.

19:34.152 --> 19:35.920
The Four Seasons is amazing.

19:35.921 --> 19:38.189
The five-star service,
the food.

19:38.190 --> 19:39.991
It just feels great
to get wined and dined.

19:39.992 --> 19:41.425
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

19:41.426 --> 19:42.960
I kind of feel like a queen.

19:42.961 --> 19:45.663
My sweet potatoes were bangin'.

19:45.664 --> 19:47.164
I'm kind of a big deal, dude.

19:47.165 --> 19:48.766
That's really nice. Ooh.

19:48.767 --> 19:51.102
Dana talks a big game.

19:51.103 --> 19:53.537
And she's definitely
full of herself.

19:53.538 --> 19:54.739
And I'm tired of it.

19:54.740 --> 19:57.875
Why are you staring at me?

19:57.876 --> 20:00.911
Awkward.

20:00.912 --> 20:01.912
Lotta balls.

20:01.913 --> 20:02.913
Lotta [bleep] balls, man.

20:02.914 --> 20:04.415
<i>Yup.</i>

20:04.416 --> 20:05.950
(Clemenza) Churning butter
was definitely hard,

20:05.951 --> 20:07.284
but now to roll

20:07.285 --> 20:09.420
4,632-million little
one-ounce balls of bread

20:09.421 --> 20:12.857
and bake them
is just [bleep] annoying.

20:12.858 --> 20:14.759
Clemenza, stop eating it.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.293
Relax.

20:16.294 --> 20:18.129
No, don't tell me to relax.
That's why we keep losing.

20:18.130 --> 20:19.764
Well, hey, hey, hey.

20:19.765 --> 20:22.133
<i>(Christina) Hi, guys.</i>

20:22.134 --> 20:23.834
Come on this side,
and you can play with my balls.

20:23.835 --> 20:24.635
<i>(Dana) No, thank you.</i>

20:24.636 --> 20:27.338
<i>(Kimmie) Let's go, ladies.</i>

20:27.339 --> 20:28.639
<i>(Christina) All right, guys.</i>

20:28.640 --> 20:29.840
Girl, we got this.

20:29.841 --> 20:31.709
I'm feeling confident
about the red team

20:31.710 --> 20:34.245
in our ability
to put food out tonight.

20:34.246 --> 20:36.414
The blue team is looking like
they're pretty tired,

20:36.415 --> 20:38.149
so as long as Barbie

20:38.150 --> 20:40.785
can check her bitch attitude
at the door,

20:40.786 --> 20:42.453
we're gonna [bleep]
rock dinner service.

20:42.454 --> 20:43.921
Let's go, ladies.
Yes, chef.

20:43.922 --> 20:45.456
(Announcer) It's just moments
before the doors open

20:45.457 --> 20:47.124
for a special dinner service

20:47.125 --> 20:49.126
featuring Southern cuisine.

20:49.127 --> 20:51.262
Come on up, blue team.
Quick. Quick.

20:51.263 --> 20:52.897
(Announcer) And chef Ramsay
wants to make sure the chefs

20:52.898 --> 20:55.066
are ready for the challenge
that lies ahead.

20:55.067 --> 20:56.400
Okay.

20:56.401 --> 20:58.169
Tonight, for the first time
in Hell's Kitchen,

20:58.170 --> 20:59.937
we are doing the most amazing

20:59.938 --> 21:02.039
Southern cuisine menu.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.008
<i>How unique is that?
Excited?</i>

21:04.009 --> 21:05.876
<i>(All) Yes, chef. Good.</i>

21:05.877 --> 21:07.778
At this point in the game,
we should not be making

21:07.779 --> 21:08.846
<i>careless mistakes.</i>

21:08.847 --> 21:09.780
(All) Yes, chef.

21:09.781 --> 21:11.449
Let's go, guys.

21:11.450 --> 21:12.516
Everything's set up for you.

21:12.517 --> 21:13.984
<i>Kimmie...</i>

21:13.985 --> 21:16.220
If there's one person
that should be absolutely key

21:16.221 --> 21:19.356
<i>to the success of the red team
tonight, it should be you.</i>

21:19.357 --> 21:20.691
Yes, chef.

21:20.692 --> 21:22.326
I feel like there's
a lot of pressure on me

21:22.327 --> 21:23.694
because I'm from the South,

21:23.695 --> 21:25.296
<i>i'm the only one
in the house from the South.</i>

21:25.297 --> 21:26.697
I mean, it's...
it's a lot of pressure.

21:26.698 --> 21:28.265
This is what you pride yourself
on, this style of cooking.

21:28.266 --> 21:29.433
Yes, chef.

21:29.434 --> 21:32.636
Try to inspire your team.

21:32.637 --> 21:35.473
At this point, I'm slowly
starting to freak out.

21:35.474 --> 21:37.675
I'm nervous.
I have to shine.

21:37.676 --> 21:38.976
I have to.

21:38.977 --> 21:40.311
<i>(Christina)
Kimmie, you can do this.</i>

21:40.312 --> 21:41.178
Let's go, Kimmie.

21:41.179 --> 21:43.253
How long, Kimmie?
Oh, my God.

21:49.820 --> 21:52.255
(Announcer) Hell's Kitchen
is just moments away

21:52.256 --> 21:54.324
from opening for the first-ever
Southern cuisine night...

21:54.325 --> 21:56.359
<i>Let's go, Kimmie.
Yes, chef.</i>

21:56.360 --> 21:57.761
This is what you pride yourself
on, this style of cooking.

21:57.762 --> 21:59.029
Yes, chef.

21:59.030 --> 22:00.997
Try to inspire your team.

22:00.998 --> 22:03.133
And one chef
is feeling the pressure

22:03.134 --> 22:05.568
more than anyone else.

22:05.569 --> 22:07.203
<i>(Dana) Kimmie, you can do this.</i>

22:07.204 --> 22:08.104
<i>(Christina)
Kimmie, you're good?</i>

22:08.105 --> 22:09.673
(Kimmie) Oh, my God.

22:09.674 --> 22:11.474
I'm super stoked for tonight,

22:11.475 --> 22:12.876
'cause this is what I do
every day of my life.

22:12.877 --> 22:15.145
But yet I'm nervous
because I know

22:15.146 --> 22:17.347
chef Ramsay's gonna be
watching me hardcore tonight.

22:17.348 --> 22:18.715
So I'll just have to be ready
and be on my game.

22:18.716 --> 22:20.417
<i>Uh, James.
Yes, chef?</i>

22:20.418 --> 22:21.685
Let's go, please.
Open Hell's Kitchen.

22:21.686 --> 22:23.687
Yes, chef.

22:32.196 --> 22:34.597
(Announcer) Tonight's diners
arrive eager to sample

22:34.598 --> 22:37.000
chef Ramsay's
Southern-themed cuisine.

22:37.001 --> 22:38.435
Can I try the watermelon salad?

22:38.436 --> 22:39.836
The pecan-crusted catfish.

22:39.837 --> 22:41.771
And the fried chicken.

22:41.772 --> 22:44.341
(Announcer) The special menu will
feature a crab cake appetizer,

22:44.342 --> 22:46.943
a catfish entree,
and, of course,

22:46.944 --> 22:49.212
the Southern staple
of fried chicken.

22:49.213 --> 22:50.847
<i>(All) Salud.</i>

22:50.848 --> 22:52.182
To a good meal.

22:52.183 --> 22:53.950
Here we go, ladies.

22:53.951 --> 22:55.919
<i>Four couples waiting,
table 30, two crab cakes,</i>

22:55.920 --> 22:56.720
one shrimp,
one watermelon salad.

22:56.721 --> 22:57.320
(All) Yes, chef.

22:57.321 --> 22:58.455
How long?

22:58.456 --> 23:00.724
<i>Five minutes, chef.
Let's go.</i>

23:00.725 --> 23:02.892
Crab cakes? Come on. I mean,
what could be easier than that?

23:02.893 --> 23:03.960
<i>(Gordon)
Crab cake, where are they?</i>

23:03.961 --> 23:05.095
<i>They're coming,
chef, right now.</i>

23:05.096 --> 23:07.897
<i>Let's go.
Yes, chef. They're walking.</i>

23:07.898 --> 23:09.999
Dana...

23:10.000 --> 23:11.167
They're cooked nicely, Dana.

23:11.168 --> 23:12.001
Thank you, chef.

23:12.002 --> 23:14.104
Service, please.

23:14.105 --> 23:16.639
(Announcer) With Dana getting the
red team off to a solid start...

23:16.640 --> 23:17.574
<i>Shrimp salad's ready.
All right. Let's go.</i>

23:17.575 --> 23:19.509
A steady stream of appetizers

23:19.510 --> 23:20.844
makes its way
to the dining room.

23:20.845 --> 23:21.511
Go, please, John.

23:21.512 --> 23:22.746
This is excellent.

23:22.747 --> 23:24.247
<i>This is really, really good.</i>

23:24.248 --> 23:25.715
Impressive.

23:25.716 --> 23:27.584
(Announcer) Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

23:27.585 --> 23:28.318
An order.
Two oysters, two crab cakes.

23:28.319 --> 23:30.253
(All) Yes, chef!

23:30.254 --> 23:32.589
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay is looking
for Justin on appetizers,

23:32.590 --> 23:34.257
and Brian on fish

23:34.258 --> 23:36.326
to match the excellent start
in the red kitchen.

23:36.327 --> 23:37.327
How long?

23:37.328 --> 23:38.862
Two minutes, chef.

23:38.863 --> 23:40.930
In the past, I [bleep] up
on the fish station.

23:40.931 --> 23:43.800
But I'm going to show
the oysters I'm big daddy.

23:43.801 --> 23:44.934
Game on.

23:44.935 --> 23:46.169
Crab cakes behind you.

23:46.170 --> 23:47.504
Oysters, where are they?

23:47.505 --> 23:49.299
<i>Walking.
(Gordon) Come on!</i>

23:52.109 --> 23:53.710
They're cooked to [bleep].

23:53.711 --> 23:56.246
I mean, it's like
a [bleep] ball of snot.

23:56.247 --> 23:57.981
Blue team, hey, come here, you.

23:57.982 --> 24:00.450
<i>All of you.
Just touch them.</i>

24:00.451 --> 24:01.918
Touch them. Touch them.

24:01.919 --> 24:03.486
<i>Look how cooked they are.</i>

24:03.487 --> 24:05.388
It's like they're bullets.
Solid bullets.

24:05.389 --> 24:06.890
(Robyn) They look hard,

24:06.891 --> 24:09.225
overdone, not attractive
whatsoever.

24:09.226 --> 24:11.094
It looks like something
a rabbit [bleep] out.

24:11.095 --> 24:12.162
Speed up!

24:12.163 --> 24:13.196
Dropped more right now.

24:13.197 --> 24:14.197
Damn it.

24:14.198 --> 24:15.398
Why did I do that?

24:15.399 --> 24:17.734
Uh, you idiot, Brian.
Idiot.

24:17.735 --> 24:20.773
Oysters walking.
Here, chef.

24:22.606 --> 24:24.441
<i>(Gordon) Brian...</i>

24:24.442 --> 24:25.708
They're perfect.

24:25.709 --> 24:27.510
Thank you.

24:27.511 --> 24:28.845
Uh, thank God.
Good, good, good, good.

24:28.846 --> 24:29.512
Everything's okay.

24:29.513 --> 24:30.914
Service, please.

24:30.915 --> 24:32.649
<i>But from now on,
I need to whip ass.</i>

24:32.650 --> 24:34.784
All day, all night.
Whip ass, all the time.

24:34.785 --> 24:36.853
Come on, keep it up.

24:36.854 --> 24:39.689
(Announcer) The blue team has recovered
from Brian's stumble on oysters.

24:39.690 --> 24:41.124
Mmm!

24:41.125 --> 24:43.493
And the red team...
Go, please.

24:43.494 --> 24:45.361
Has completed
their appetizers with ease.

24:45.362 --> 24:47.163
Two catfish, two chicken,
two meatloaf.

24:47.164 --> 24:50.366
(Announcer) Now, Kimmie on
fish, and Christina on meat,

24:50.367 --> 24:51.634
are looking to do
the same on entrees.

24:51.635 --> 24:52.535
How long?

24:52.536 --> 24:53.536
How long you need?

24:53.537 --> 24:54.737
I need four minutes.

24:54.738 --> 24:55.839
Four minutes is good for me.

24:55.840 --> 24:56.973
We're all communicating...

24:56.974 --> 24:58.174
<i>Barbie, are you with her?
Yes.</i>

24:58.175 --> 25:00.477
And now it's my time to shine,

25:00.478 --> 25:01.711
so I'm about
to rock this [bleep].

25:01.712 --> 25:03.546
Garnish, chef.

25:03.547 --> 25:04.681
Chef, walking with two chicken.

25:04.682 --> 25:05.548
Catfish.

25:05.549 --> 25:06.583
Walking now, chef.

25:06.584 --> 25:07.684
Let's go.

25:07.685 --> 25:09.352
On your back, on your back.

25:09.353 --> 25:11.988
Come on, let's go.

25:11.989 --> 25:14.023
[Bleep] burnt.
[Bleep] me.

25:14.024 --> 25:16.793
Our first [bleep] table, do
you know what I mean? Yeah.

25:16.794 --> 25:19.362
Kimmie.

25:19.363 --> 25:20.630
<i>Uh, that's burned there.</i>

25:20.631 --> 25:21.898
Yes, chef.
That's burnt.

25:21.899 --> 25:23.399
Got you in three minutes, chef.

25:23.400 --> 25:24.834
<i>That's burned.
Got you in three minutes, chef!</i>

25:24.835 --> 25:26.002
Give me your best!

25:26.003 --> 25:27.003
Yes, chef.

25:27.004 --> 25:28.505
(Barbie) Catfish.

25:28.506 --> 25:29.873
It's not that hard.

25:29.874 --> 25:31.341
And you supposed to be
from the South.

25:31.342 --> 25:34.444
You cannot cook. Period.

25:34.445 --> 25:36.145
This is [bleep] up.

25:36.146 --> 25:37.747
<i>(Dana) It's all right,
Kimmie, push through.</i>

25:37.748 --> 25:38.815
Come on, Kimmie, please!

25:38.816 --> 25:41.718
I got the refire
coming right now, chef.

25:41.719 --> 25:43.887
(Announcer) While Kimmie starts over
on her first order of catfish...

25:43.888 --> 25:45.421
[Groans]

25:45.422 --> 25:46.890
The blue team...

25:46.891 --> 25:48.558
An order. Entree.
Three catfish, one chicken.

25:48.559 --> 25:49.926
(All) Yes, chef!

25:49.927 --> 25:51.628
Has also moved on to entrees,

25:51.629 --> 25:54.964
led by Robyn on meat,
and Brian on fish.

25:54.965 --> 25:56.299
How long on the catfish, Brian?

25:56.300 --> 25:57.867
Three minutes.

25:57.868 --> 25:59.602
Dinner service
started off rough,

25:59.603 --> 26:01.905
so now, I'm just trying to do

26:01.906 --> 26:04.741
anything I possibly can
to make everything go smooth.

26:04.742 --> 26:06.142
Catfish. It's ready.

26:06.143 --> 26:07.210
Behind.

26:07.211 --> 26:08.745
Garnish. Come on, you.

26:08.746 --> 26:10.246
Right here, chef.
Comin' in. This pan's hot.

26:10.247 --> 26:11.347
Right here, chef.

26:11.348 --> 26:12.782
[Bleep] me.

26:12.783 --> 26:14.250
Burnt one side.

26:14.251 --> 26:18.021
Hey, all of you, come here!

26:18.022 --> 26:19.789
Yeah, come here.

26:19.790 --> 26:22.559
Look. No color,
and look, burnt.

26:22.560 --> 26:24.093
Really, dude?
It's a [bleep] piece of fish.

26:24.094 --> 26:26.362
Like, I mean, come on.

26:26.363 --> 26:27.830
Step it up a little bit.

26:27.831 --> 26:29.232
Come here.
Just take a bite of that.

26:29.233 --> 26:30.800
<i>Just take a bite.
Eat it, you [bleep].</i>

26:30.801 --> 26:31.834
How does it taste?

26:31.835 --> 26:35.438
Tastes like fish, chef.

26:35.439 --> 26:37.173
<i>(Gordon) Excuse me?</i>

26:37.174 --> 26:38.341
<i>Smart ass.</i>

26:38.342 --> 26:39.442
You want to be
funny now, do you?

26:39.443 --> 26:40.209
<i>No.
Yeah.</i>

26:40.210 --> 26:41.311
<i>You're such a [bleep].</i>

26:41.312 --> 26:44.280
(Robyn) Brian, really?

26:44.281 --> 26:46.049
Right now is not the time
to [bleep] crack jokes, bro.

26:46.050 --> 26:47.283
Get out.

26:47.284 --> 26:49.385
[Bleep] me. Get out.
[Bleep]in' idiot.

26:49.386 --> 26:50.687
Serious, man?

26:50.688 --> 26:52.355
It was a mistake
of epic proportions.

26:52.356 --> 26:54.891
<i>I did not mean
to be a smart ass.</i>

26:54.892 --> 26:57.794
"Tastes like fish."
What a [bleep] [bleep].

26:57.795 --> 27:00.763
Just the first thing
that came to my head.

27:00.764 --> 27:01.998
What are you doing?

27:01.999 --> 27:03.933
Go back in there and fight.

27:03.934 --> 27:05.835
Chef Ramsay wants a fighter.

27:05.836 --> 27:07.704
He doesn't want
somebody to be a wimp.

27:07.705 --> 27:09.706
No. He doesn't want
someone to crack.

27:09.707 --> 27:10.673
No, I'm not.
So get back in there, and fight.

27:10.674 --> 27:12.275
Thank you.

27:12.276 --> 27:14.544
I'm not gonna let chef Ramsay
down, there's no [bleep] way.

27:14.545 --> 27:16.646
I'm gonna jump back on
my station and fight.

27:16.647 --> 27:18.214
What do we got working?

27:18.215 --> 27:20.016
Hey, you. Hey, come here,
you [bleep] face.

27:20.017 --> 27:21.017
What're you doing here?

27:21.018 --> 27:22.051
I'm not done!

27:22.052 --> 27:23.119
Don't [bleep] shout at me.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.687
I'm sorry.

27:24.688 --> 27:26.422
I'm gonna ask you one
more [bleep] time.

27:26.423 --> 27:27.590
You give me a [bleep] answer,

27:27.591 --> 27:28.925
that jacket's coming off,

27:28.926 --> 27:29.759
and you're going
through that door, home.

27:29.760 --> 27:30.526
Yes, chef.

27:30.527 --> 27:31.527
How did that fish taste?

27:31.528 --> 27:32.795
[Bleep].

27:32.796 --> 27:34.464
Yeah, so why'd you give it to me?
Burnt.

27:34.465 --> 27:35.698
I didn't see the bottom, chef.

27:35.699 --> 27:37.867
I didn't see the bottom.
It's not gonna happen again.

27:37.868 --> 27:39.936
(Announcer) While Brian may have
talked his way back into the kitchen,

27:39.937 --> 27:42.105
[Bleep].

27:42.106 --> 27:44.307
the blue team has completely
stalled on entrees.

27:44.308 --> 27:48.845
And diners are getting
very hungry and very unhappy.

27:48.846 --> 27:50.313
Meanwhile,
in the red kitchen...

27:50.314 --> 27:51.681
Two catfish.
How long?

27:51.682 --> 27:53.583
A minute and a half, chef!

27:53.584 --> 27:56.085
Kimmie makes a second attempt
at her initial order of catfish.

27:56.086 --> 27:57.987
Dana, did you get
that fish spatula back?

27:57.988 --> 27:59.088
I gave it to you.

27:59.089 --> 28:01.157
Two chicken.

28:01.158 --> 28:03.960
This is [bleep] ridiculous
without a [bleep] fish spatula.

28:03.961 --> 28:05.228
Kimmie, urgently!

28:05.229 --> 28:07.030
Coming now, chef, coming now.

28:07.031 --> 28:09.966
This is [bleep] up.

28:09.967 --> 28:11.768
[Groans]

28:11.769 --> 28:13.136
Whoa.

28:13.137 --> 28:14.437
<i>(Dana) You okay, Kimmie?</i>

28:14.438 --> 28:16.305
Face is on fire, dude.

28:16.306 --> 28:18.675
The oil popped up
outta the pan,

28:18.676 --> 28:20.410
burnt one side of my face
really bad.

28:20.411 --> 28:21.978
Dying on two catfish.

28:21.979 --> 28:23.579
Walking now, chef.

28:23.580 --> 28:26.449
But I gotta make sure
that this fish goes out right,

28:26.450 --> 28:27.450
or I'm [bleep].

28:27.451 --> 28:31.587
There you go.

28:31.588 --> 28:32.755
Good. Let's go.

28:32.756 --> 28:34.657
Good job, girls, good job.

28:34.658 --> 28:36.426
(Announcer) With Kimmie's
catfish making the grade...

28:36.427 --> 28:38.061
Service, please.

28:38.062 --> 28:40.663
Entrees are finally making
their way out to excited diners.

28:40.664 --> 28:42.331
Catfish is really good.

28:42.332 --> 28:44.033
(Announcer) Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

28:44.034 --> 28:45.134
Two catfish, one chicken.

28:45.135 --> 28:46.135
How long?

28:46.136 --> 28:47.503
Two minutes, chef.

28:47.504 --> 28:49.939
Chef Ramsay is hoping
Robyn and Brian

28:49.940 --> 28:53.242
can successfully deliver their
first table of entrees as well.

28:53.243 --> 28:54.711
<i>Come on, Brian!
Yes, chef.</i>

28:54.712 --> 28:55.978
Are you walking with garnish?

28:55.979 --> 28:57.580
<i>Yes, one minute.
One minute?</i>

28:57.581 --> 28:59.415
Sometimes my brain
gets the best of me,

28:59.416 --> 29:01.718
but I don't make
the same mistake twice.

29:01.719 --> 29:04.487
So, now, I better have
a good piece of fish.

29:04.488 --> 29:05.621
Or I'm in deep [bleep].

29:05.622 --> 29:07.023
Catfish is ready.

29:07.024 --> 29:08.658
<i>Cat go with the chicken?
Yes.</i>

29:08.659 --> 29:10.193
Josh, help me walk
garnish up, please.

29:10.194 --> 29:11.661
<i>(Gordon) Let's go.
(Brian) Excuse me.</i>

29:11.662 --> 29:12.195
<i>Right behind.
Good. Let's go.</i>

29:12.196 --> 29:13.196
We got it now, guys.

29:13.197 --> 29:14.564
We've had a rough start,

29:14.565 --> 29:16.099
but now we're
rockin' and rollin'.

29:16.100 --> 29:17.300
[Bleep] me.

29:17.301 --> 29:20.903
The chicken is raw.

29:20.904 --> 29:23.372
All of you!
All of you!

29:23.373 --> 29:26.809
That's you, you [bleep]!

29:26.810 --> 29:28.578
Chicken. It comes up.
(Robyn) Raw.

29:28.579 --> 29:30.346
Raw!

29:30.347 --> 29:32.081
[Bleep].

29:32.082 --> 29:33.849
Robyn, really?
It's pink, it's still [bleep] bleeding.

29:33.850 --> 29:37.497
Come on, get it right.
Robyn, really? Really?

29:38.922 --> 29:40.923
Raw!

29:46.975 --> 29:48.909
(Announcer) It's an hour
into dinner service,

29:48.910 --> 29:50.344
and thanks to Robyn...

29:50.345 --> 29:52.946
Chicken. It comes up,
and it's raw.

29:52.947 --> 29:54.481
Raw!

29:54.482 --> 29:57.517
The blue team's entrees are
stopped once again at the pass.

29:57.518 --> 29:59.987
Hey, comedian.
Crack a [bleep] joke now.

29:59.988 --> 30:02.322
I [bleep] dare you.

30:02.323 --> 30:03.857
I have nothing funny
to say, chef.

30:03.858 --> 30:04.691
<i>(Gordon) Start again.</i>

30:04.692 --> 30:05.892
[Bleep].

30:05.893 --> 30:07.661
Blue team needs
to wake the [bleep] up.

30:07.662 --> 30:08.228
Listen, do you need help
right now? Let me help you.

30:08.229 --> 30:09.062
Yes.

30:09.063 --> 30:10.464
<i>(Justin) Clemenza, how long?</i>

30:10.465 --> 30:11.832
<i>(Clemenza) Gimme two minutes.</i>

30:11.833 --> 30:13.266
I had to redo
all your garnish twice.

30:13.267 --> 30:14.668
I just need a time, I don't
need an explanation, please.

30:14.669 --> 30:16.169
I need two minutes,
that's what I need!

30:16.170 --> 30:17.471
<i>Thank you. That's it.
That's all I need to hear.</i>

30:17.472 --> 30:18.872
I don't need your
sarcasm either.

30:18.873 --> 30:20.774
(Announcer) While the blue team
seems to be falling apart...

30:20.775 --> 30:22.843
[Bleep] tell me you don't
need an explanation.

30:22.844 --> 30:23.944
<i>Get some chicken,
and make sure it's cooked.</i>

30:23.945 --> 30:24.945
I know.

30:24.946 --> 30:26.413
Back in the red kitchen...

30:26.414 --> 30:27.080
Three catfish,
one chicken away.

30:27.081 --> 30:28.015
How long?

30:28.016 --> 30:29.282
I can walk on two chicken.

30:29.283 --> 30:30.550
I can walk on two catfish.

30:30.551 --> 30:31.618
Are you good
on garnish, Barbie?

30:31.619 --> 30:32.886
I'm good.

30:32.887 --> 30:34.554
The women seem to be
coming together on entrees.

30:34.555 --> 30:35.655
<i>(Gordon) Barbie!</i>

30:35.656 --> 30:36.556
Garnish. Let's go.

30:36.557 --> 30:37.758
Yes, chef.

30:37.759 --> 30:38.792
<i>Because of Kimmie,
we got behind.</i>

30:38.793 --> 30:39.960
Walking.

30:39.961 --> 30:41.428
Walking with chicken.

30:41.429 --> 30:44.364
So, now, everybody
has to be on point.

30:44.365 --> 30:46.975
And I'm gonna make sure
that one of those people is me.

30:50.705 --> 30:53.073
Hey, all of you, stop.

30:53.074 --> 30:54.074
Taste that.

30:54.075 --> 30:55.809
[Bleep] me. Really?

30:55.810 --> 30:57.778
Just taste it.
Taste it.

30:57.779 --> 30:59.946
And tell me what it needs.

30:59.947 --> 31:02.049
(All)
Ugh. Salt.

31:02.050 --> 31:06.053
We can't season food.
Just look at the state of you.

31:06.054 --> 31:08.255
Barbie, she [bleep] up again,

31:08.256 --> 31:10.223
like she has
in eight other services.

31:10.224 --> 31:13.226
Barbie, go home.
We don't want you here.

31:13.227 --> 31:15.095
I'm taking the mac and cheese
on this side.

31:15.096 --> 31:16.730
Dude, finish what you're doing.
Okay.

31:16.731 --> 31:18.165
(Announcer) While the red
team suffers another setback

31:18.166 --> 31:20.500
on their second table
of entrees...

31:20.501 --> 31:22.169
Could we get past
the second ticket tonight?

31:22.170 --> 31:23.470
In the blue kitchen...

31:23.471 --> 31:25.038
Three chicken, one catfish.

31:25.039 --> 31:26.606
How long?

31:26.607 --> 31:28.875
Chef Ramsay is still looking
for some form of an update.

31:28.876 --> 31:30.877
Any news? Uh...

31:30.878 --> 31:33.480
Any, uh... any time?

31:33.481 --> 31:35.215
<i>(Clemenza) Yeah, it's
coming right now, chef.</i>

31:35.216 --> 31:36.116
One chicken's coming.

31:36.117 --> 31:38.318
I need to bounce back
for my team.

31:38.319 --> 31:40.320
I'm better than
[bleep] raw chicken.

31:40.321 --> 31:41.555
Much better.

31:41.556 --> 31:43.254
I'm not gonna be
the weakest link.

31:44.759 --> 31:46.827
I mean, [bleep] me.

31:46.828 --> 31:48.962
Hey.

31:48.963 --> 31:49.963
Really?

31:49.964 --> 31:54.234
You, you, you, you, come here.

31:54.235 --> 31:55.502
Hey, look. Raw.

31:55.503 --> 31:56.636
[Bleep].

31:56.637 --> 31:59.906
<i>Do I really have to serve that?</i>

31:59.907 --> 32:01.775
<i>Madness!</i>

32:01.776 --> 32:03.343
Get out.

32:03.344 --> 32:04.911
Don't kick them out, chef,
just kick me out.

32:04.912 --> 32:05.879
Listen.
Yes, chef.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.081
Don't you [bleep] dare
tell me what to do.

32:08.082 --> 32:09.249
Yes, chef.

32:09.250 --> 32:11.918
You, you, you,
you, [bleep] off.

32:11.919 --> 32:13.019
[Bleep]!

32:13.020 --> 32:14.221
[Bleep] hate this damn chicken.

32:14.222 --> 32:18.291
Get out!

32:18.292 --> 32:20.293
We are [bleep] here.

32:20.294 --> 32:22.362
It's gonna be a while till we
see any food at our table.

32:22.363 --> 32:23.930
<i>[Laughter] Right.</i>

32:23.931 --> 32:25.499
[Groans]

32:25.500 --> 32:27.634
<i>(Clemenza) We gotta do the
walk of shame again.</i>

32:27.635 --> 32:28.301
I'm embarrassed,
I'm [bleep] mortified.

32:28.302 --> 32:29.536
I don't want to [bleep] go.

32:29.537 --> 32:30.604
You... you panicked.
That's the problem.

32:30.605 --> 32:31.271
<i>You were just...</i>

32:31.272 --> 32:32.372
[Wobbles]

32:32.373 --> 32:33.373
You were all over.

32:33.374 --> 32:35.342
You got me nervous.

32:35.343 --> 32:38.812
(Announcer) With diners waiting,
and no chefs in the blue kitchen,

32:38.813 --> 32:41.214
chef Ramsay is desperate
to get some good news

32:41.215 --> 32:42.716
in the red kitchen.

32:42.717 --> 32:44.684
Two catfish, two chicken.
How long?

32:44.685 --> 32:46.052
How long you need,
Christina? Talk to me.

32:46.053 --> 32:46.820
Yeah, I'm ready.

32:46.821 --> 32:47.921
Walking with garnish.

32:47.922 --> 32:48.855
Walking with chicken.

32:48.856 --> 32:50.357
Walking now.

32:50.358 --> 32:52.759
Chef Ramsay is, like,
really pissed off right now.

32:52.760 --> 32:55.629
<i>So, we gotta bring it.
If not, we're screwed.</i>

32:55.630 --> 32:56.630
Come on, guys.

32:56.631 --> 32:59.466
Stop.

32:59.467 --> 33:00.967
<i>Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.</i>

33:00.968 --> 33:02.369
Oh, [bleep].

33:02.370 --> 33:03.770
[Groans]

33:03.771 --> 33:05.172
<i>I could cry.
I could just...</i>

33:05.173 --> 33:06.907
I could just cry.

33:06.908 --> 33:08.441
[Bleep]!

33:08.442 --> 33:10.410
Stop!

33:10.411 --> 33:11.578
Come here, you.

33:11.579 --> 33:12.812
<i>Let me show you something.</i>

33:12.813 --> 33:15.382
I've got raw...

33:15.383 --> 33:16.683
Raw [bleep] catfish there.

33:16.684 --> 33:18.084
Oh...

33:18.085 --> 33:20.754
Then there's
burnt [bleep] there.

33:20.755 --> 33:22.522
(Dana) What're you
thinking, Kimmie?

33:22.523 --> 33:24.858
This is not happening. No!

33:24.859 --> 33:29.095
You, you, you, you, get out!

33:29.096 --> 33:31.565
You're a [bleep] disgrace!

33:31.566 --> 33:33.934
[Bleep]!

33:33.935 --> 33:35.368
Hey. There. Touch.

33:35.369 --> 33:36.703
That's the raw bits!

33:36.704 --> 33:37.671
Yeah, I see it, chef.
I see it.

33:37.672 --> 33:39.940
[Bleep] disgrace!

33:39.941 --> 33:41.608
Get out!

33:44.933 --> 33:47.668
(Announcer) Both teams got
off to a commendable start,

33:47.669 --> 33:50.271
but nearly two hours
into dinner service...

33:50.272 --> 33:51.572
Get out!

33:51.573 --> 33:54.275
The blue team
has completely melted down.

33:54.276 --> 33:56.443
We're never gonna
get fed here tonight.

33:56.444 --> 33:58.412
(Announcer) And now Kimmie's
catastrophic catfish...

33:58.413 --> 33:59.747
Raw!

33:59.748 --> 34:02.650
Has chef Ramsay
completely frustrated.

34:02.651 --> 34:04.485
Get out!

34:04.486 --> 34:06.320
You're a [bleep] disgrace!

34:06.321 --> 34:08.522
<i>Get out!</i>

34:08.523 --> 34:10.324
(Christina)
We didn't complete service

34:10.324 --> 34:11.592
because of that
[Bleep] fish station.

34:11.592 --> 34:13.560
It was supposed to be
Kimmie's time to shine.

34:13.561 --> 34:14.962
Like, ugh,
I don't [bleep] get it.

34:14.963 --> 34:19.433
I don't unders... mm.

34:19.434 --> 34:20.668
You too?

34:20.668 --> 34:22.436
[Bleep] yeah, we did.

34:22.437 --> 34:23.904
And it's all my fault 'cause
I'm from the [bleep] South.

34:23.905 --> 34:27.641
<i>Right?</i>

34:27.641 --> 34:29.743
This is my first service
that I [bleep] up this bad.

34:29.744 --> 34:31.478
This is the first service
I [bleep] up.

34:31.478 --> 34:33.112
And I know there's
a lot on my shoulders,

34:33.114 --> 34:35.416
'cause I'm from the South.

34:35.417 --> 34:37.284
Come on. Don't worry.

34:37.284 --> 34:38.686
We know you got heart.

34:38.687 --> 34:40.087
I had a lot of pressure on me.

34:40.088 --> 34:41.255
I just feel like I fought.

34:41.255 --> 34:42.790
And I'll fight to stay here

34:42.791 --> 34:45.659
because I know
I deserve to be here.

34:45.659 --> 34:48.329
(Announcer)
After a horrific service,

34:48.330 --> 34:50.331
chef Ramsay
has sent chef Scott...

34:50.331 --> 34:51.998
Where is everybody?

34:52.000 --> 34:53.367
(All) Right here, chef.

34:53.368 --> 34:54.641
To gather the teams.

34:54.641 --> 34:56.966
I need everybody right now.
Downstairs, let's go.

34:56.967 --> 34:57.805
<i>(Clemenza) Yes, chef.</i>

34:57.806 --> 34:58.672
I don't know what's going on.

34:58.673 --> 35:01.308
Chef Ramsay might send
every [bleep] one of us home.

35:01.309 --> 35:03.344
Yep.
Yep.

35:03.345 --> 35:05.045
Stay there. Stay there.

35:05.046 --> 35:06.513
<i>Trust me, Scott, Andi,
and I will finish the service.</i>

35:06.514 --> 35:09.183
Let me tell you that.

35:09.184 --> 35:12.586
That was shocking!
I can't take anymore.

35:12.587 --> 35:15.689
<i>Do me a big favor...
Each of you.</i>

35:15.690 --> 35:17.291
<i>Have a good chat.</i>

35:17.292 --> 35:18.959
Based on tonight's service,

35:18.960 --> 35:20.728
come up with one individual
from each team

35:20.729 --> 35:23.974
that should be leaving
Hell's Kitchen tonight.

35:26.301 --> 35:28.936
And I hope to hell all of you
are feeling like [bleep].

35:28.937 --> 35:30.971
Yes, chef.
Pathetic.

35:30.972 --> 35:32.473
All of you, upstairs.
Get out of here.

35:35.110 --> 35:37.578
(Justin) Dinner service was
disgusting, once again.

35:37.579 --> 35:39.646
Just dumb mistakes.

35:39.647 --> 35:41.482
It's really frustrating.

35:41.483 --> 35:43.117
We need to figure out who's
the weakest link on the team.

35:43.118 --> 35:44.184
That's the bottom line.

35:44.185 --> 35:45.319
Coming up raw chicken.

35:45.320 --> 35:46.987
<i>Raw chicken.</i>

35:46.988 --> 35:48.922
Twice.

35:48.923 --> 35:50.657
Honestly, between you
and Brian tonight,

35:50.658 --> 35:51.892
I was going [bleep] ballistic.

35:51.893 --> 35:53.527
I wanted you to get out
of [bleep] dinner service

35:53.528 --> 35:55.262
<i>'cause honestly,
I can put up so many times</i>

35:55.263 --> 35:57.131
I've been put up so many times
over the last couple of nights...

35:57.132 --> 35:58.399
[bleep] face, shut the [bleep]
up for a second.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.533
What?

35:59.534 --> 36:01.368
<i>(Robyn) I just want to say yes.</i>

36:01.369 --> 36:02.770
Tonight I [bleep]
sent out raw chicken.

36:02.771 --> 36:05.773
But I didn't get kicked out
of the kitchen.

36:05.774 --> 36:09.343
Brian did.

36:09.344 --> 36:11.545
[Bleep] damn it.

36:11.546 --> 36:13.847
(Announcer) While the blue team
debates their weakest link,

36:13.848 --> 36:15.349
Christina...

36:15.350 --> 36:16.617
I'm voting for Kimmie.

36:16.618 --> 36:18.419
Has made a quick decision.

36:18.420 --> 36:20.454
We couldn't get any
further into the night.

36:20.455 --> 36:22.022
<i>(Kimmie) I understand that,</i>

36:22.023 --> 36:23.457
but I got oil
splashed in my face.

36:23.458 --> 36:27.194
And did I leave?
No, I kept cooking.

36:27.195 --> 36:29.363
This is the first time
I've messed up in service.

36:29.364 --> 36:30.964
And Barbie slacks off
and [bleep] up all the time.

36:30.965 --> 36:32.332
She's not consistent.

36:32.333 --> 36:35.169
Barbie should be
the next to go.

36:35.170 --> 36:37.504
I'm gonna vote for Barbie.

36:37.505 --> 36:39.706
<i>She doesn't communicate
with anybody,</i>

36:39.707 --> 36:42.409
and she always brings us down,
dude, [bleep] just sucks.

36:42.410 --> 36:44.044
No, this heifer didn't.

36:44.045 --> 36:46.146
I know Kimmie's not gonna
vote for herself,

36:46.147 --> 36:47.648
but she knows she's wrong.

36:47.649 --> 36:49.249
Whatever.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.818
The catfish brought the kitchen
to a screeching halt,

36:50.819 --> 36:52.052
not the kale.

36:52.053 --> 36:54.388
So I have no words for Kimmie,

36:54.389 --> 36:56.290
'cause I'm not leaving tonight.

36:56.291 --> 36:57.758
I'm sure of that.

36:57.759 --> 37:01.028
My thing is this...

37:01.029 --> 37:03.397
And I'm struggling with
the fact that I have to

37:03.398 --> 37:06.934
think about, like,
who I would want on my team,

37:06.935 --> 37:09.770
and I think that Kimmie's
a better team player.

37:09.771 --> 37:13.407
But if I vote for Barbie,
then we're in [bleep] deadlock.

37:13.408 --> 37:16.043
I don't know what to do.

37:24.388 --> 37:26.622
(Announcer)
After a dismal service,

37:26.623 --> 37:29.058
where all of the chefs
were rejected from the kitchen,

37:29.059 --> 37:32.028
chef Ramsay has asked
for just one nominee

37:32.029 --> 37:33.396
from each team.

37:33.397 --> 37:35.831
What a disappointment.

37:35.832 --> 37:40.436
On a night when we were doing
simple Southern cuisine...

37:40.437 --> 37:44.140
It all went South.
Congratulations.

37:44.141 --> 37:45.141
Dana.

37:45.142 --> 37:46.409
Yes, chef.

37:46.410 --> 37:48.244
Who is the red team's nominee?

37:48.245 --> 37:49.947
The red team's nominee is...

37:51.748 --> 37:52.782
Kimmie, chef.

37:52.783 --> 37:54.483
<i>(Gordon) Kimmie.</i>

37:54.484 --> 37:55.518
Why?

37:55.519 --> 37:57.019
We couldn't move forward

37:57.020 --> 37:59.865
because the fish
just halted everything.

38:02.326 --> 38:03.326
[Sighs]

38:03.327 --> 38:05.728
Blue team.

38:05.729 --> 38:06.829
<i>Justin.
Yes, chef.</i>

38:06.830 --> 38:08.253
Who is it, and why?

38:10.133 --> 38:13.469
Robyn, chef.

38:13.470 --> 38:15.438
<i>She couldn't focus on the dish,</i>

38:15.439 --> 38:17.306
and it was one raw chicken
after the next raw chicken.

38:17.307 --> 38:19.442
And it just seemed like
things were all over it.

38:19.443 --> 38:20.576
[Sighs]

38:20.577 --> 38:24.647
Robyn, Kimmie,
step forward, please.

38:25.849 --> 38:26.849
<i>Uh, Robyn.</i>

38:26.850 --> 38:28.117
Yes, chef.

38:28.118 --> 38:30.419
Why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

38:30.420 --> 38:32.555
I'm not ready to go, chef.
I'm not ready to go.

38:32.556 --> 38:34.190
<i>I lost focus
'cause of the chicken.</i>

38:34.191 --> 38:35.658
It [bleep] me tonight, chef.

38:35.659 --> 38:36.726
The chicken didn't [bleep] you,

38:36.727 --> 38:39.962
you [bleep] the chicken.

38:39.963 --> 38:42.498
Kimmie, if there
was one service

38:42.499 --> 38:45.768
that I really thought
you were gonna shine,

38:45.769 --> 38:48.704
it was tonight.

38:48.705 --> 38:50.206
What happened?

38:50.207 --> 38:53.743
The catfish, chef, I just...
I lost control of it.

38:53.744 --> 38:55.978
<i>But this is the first time
I've been up for elimination,</i>

38:55.979 --> 38:57.213
<i>i've been fighting,
I'm here to fight,</i>

38:57.214 --> 38:59.260
and I don't think
I deserve to go home, chef.

39:00.247 --> 39:02.501
And do you think
you're better than Robyn?

39:05.122 --> 39:07.123
Yes, chef.

39:07.124 --> 39:09.358
<i>I think I have more
passion than her.</i>

39:09.359 --> 39:12.061
I have more drive than her,
I have more fight-back than her,

39:12.062 --> 39:14.997
and I think I can cook
better than her.

39:14.998 --> 39:16.766
And do you think that
you're better than Kimmie?

39:16.767 --> 39:19.301
Yes, I do, chef.

39:19.302 --> 39:21.203
I'm letting my head
[bleep] me up, chef.

39:21.204 --> 39:23.672
This is a competition.

39:23.673 --> 39:26.175
Not therapy.

39:26.176 --> 39:27.877
I know it's not therapy.

39:27.878 --> 39:29.445
I want to be your head chef.
That's why I came here.

39:29.446 --> 39:31.480
<i>I want to stay here so bad.</i>

39:31.481 --> 39:33.549
I'm not ready to leave
Hell's Kitchen yet, chef.

39:33.550 --> 39:34.641
I'm not.

39:37.054 --> 39:38.888
This is a very difficult
decision for me.

39:38.889 --> 39:40.356
<i>Let me tell you.</i>

39:40.357 --> 39:42.758
And so far, the hardest one.

39:42.759 --> 39:45.537
<i>The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen is...</i>

39:48.799 --> 39:50.498
[Sighs]

39:52.502 --> 39:55.004
Robyn...

39:55.005 --> 39:57.640
[Exhales]

39:57.641 --> 39:58.741
Back in line.

39:58.742 --> 40:00.773
Kimmie, gimme your jacket.

40:02.913 --> 40:05.648
<i>Young lady, you're not ready
for Gordon Ramsay's Steak.</i>

40:05.649 --> 40:06.782
I'm sorry.

40:06.783 --> 40:09.452
<i>Big heart, love the passion,</i>

40:09.453 --> 40:10.686
<i>but you are not ready.</i>

40:10.687 --> 40:11.921
Thank you.

40:11.922 --> 40:13.789
[Inhales]

40:13.790 --> 40:15.958
I love you guys.

40:15.959 --> 40:18.828
Love you, Kimmie.

40:18.829 --> 40:21.730
[Sniffs]

40:21.731 --> 40:23.566
(Kimmie)
I'm disappointed in myself.

40:23.567 --> 40:25.601
It was not my time to go,
by any means.

40:25.602 --> 40:27.770
Definitely Barbie should be
going home right now.

40:27.771 --> 40:29.772
You know, she's been
up five or six times.

40:29.773 --> 40:31.607
This is the first time
I've ever been up there.

40:31.608 --> 40:33.909
And I have so much fight,
and I've learned so much.

40:33.910 --> 40:35.711
And I thought I was
going to the top,

40:35.712 --> 40:37.246
I thought I was
gonna be his head chef,

40:37.247 --> 40:39.415
and I guess I just
didn't accomplish that.

40:39.416 --> 40:40.883
All of you,

40:40.884 --> 40:42.118
I am so pissed off.

40:42.119 --> 40:45.621
<i>What a [bleep] embarrassment.</i>

40:45.622 --> 40:47.820
I've got one important
question for you all.

40:49.493 --> 40:50.860
Are you ready to fight back?

40:50.861 --> 40:52.768
(All) Yes, chef!

40:54.664 --> 40:55.898
Show me. And hurry up.

40:55.899 --> 40:57.433
Get out of here.

40:57.434 --> 40:59.735
(Robyn) I need to
focus on myself now,

40:59.736 --> 41:01.137
and protect myself,

41:01.138 --> 41:02.605
because you know what?

41:02.606 --> 41:04.106
The only person
I really trust here is me.

41:04.107 --> 41:05.808
Mac and cheese
and fried chicken.

41:05.809 --> 41:08.844
<i>I mean, do me a favor.</i>

41:08.845 --> 41:10.613
Robyn definitely
has a lot to prove.

41:10.614 --> 41:12.114
She's gotta bounce back
next service.

41:12.115 --> 41:13.415
She's gotta be flawless.

41:13.416 --> 41:15.417
Otherwise, she's going home.

41:15.418 --> 41:18.754
(Barbie) At this stage of the
game, I'm not scared of anyone.

41:18.755 --> 41:21.957
I've had to watch my back since
this entire competition started.

41:21.958 --> 41:23.359
I'm not gonna stop now.

41:23.360 --> 41:26.328
11 people down,
6 more people to go.

41:26.329 --> 41:28.597
As a woman from Memphis,

41:28.598 --> 41:30.499
tonight's Southern cuisine menu

41:30.500 --> 41:32.401
should've been an easy
walk in the park for Kimmie,

41:32.402 --> 41:34.803
but it turned out to be
a difficult uphill battle,

41:34.804 --> 41:37.682
and that is why
it was her time to go.
