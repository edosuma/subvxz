Thanks, Meredith.

05:27.834 --> 05:30.099
- I'll take her. Did she eat?
- Yeah, an hour ago.

05:30.101 --> 05:32.531
- Hi, baby.
- Ooh, yummy!

05:32.533 --> 05:35.565
Yeah.
Mama's busy right now.

05:35.567 --> 05:38.565
Well, Ali's gonna
play with you.

05:38.567 --> 05:41.032
- Danny needs these signed, so... okay.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

05:41.034 --> 05:42.268
Thank you.

06:04.001 --> 06:06.431
Mama missed you,
Mama missed you.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.700
Oh!

06:09.234 --> 06:13.099
Come on, come on. Gimme, gimme, gimme.
Come on, come on. Yay!

06:13.101 --> 06:17.332
Whoa! There she is,
the princess.

06:17.334 --> 06:18.832
- Danny brought her?
- I don't know.

06:18.834 --> 06:20.099
- Dan's not here?
- I haven't seen him.

06:20.101 --> 06:21.398
Did he not see the show?
Is Ya-ema here?

06:21.400 --> 06:22.899
- There you are.
- Yeah, here the fuck am I.

06:22.901 --> 06:23.999
Where's Danny?
Where's Ya-ema?

06:24.001 --> 06:25.565
Uh, Danny's saying
goodbye to people.

06:25.567 --> 06:28.099
- Is she with him?
- She... She was...

06:28.101 --> 06:32.665
Ah, I want her away from my
kid, okay? I want her away from my kid.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.299
Now, is he gonna come
pick her up tonight

06:34.301 --> 06:36.865
or am I supposed to? What's happening,
because I've gotta do that thing tomorrow

06:36.867 --> 06:39.500
so you've gotta come pick her up
first thing in the AYEM, all right?

06:40.101 --> 06:42.266
Ya-ema!

06:42.268 --> 06:43.765
I mean, I don't know how
you can show yourself.

06:43.767 --> 06:45.865
I assumed you worked it out
with him.

06:45.867 --> 06:48.400
That's not true. That's not true.
I hadn't worked it out.

06:48.934 --> 06:50.001
That's not true.

06:53.368 --> 06:55.334
Oh, Ya-ema. My darling.

06:56.034 --> 06:57.099
Becky needs friends.

07:04.268 --> 07:05.932
Yes!

07:05.934 --> 07:07.765
Ya-ema, onward.

07:07.767 --> 07:09.600
Come here, darling!
Come here.

07:12.368 --> 07:13.732
What's his deal?

07:13.734 --> 07:15.099
She calls him Ya-ema

07:15.101 --> 07:17.465
but I think
his real name's Alvin.

07:17.467 --> 07:19.201
I call him Sauron.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.067
There she is.

07:31.101 --> 07:32.368
Hi, honey.

08:09.201 --> 08:10.500
The orange one.

08:16.334 --> 08:18.598
We've purged the essence

08:18.600 --> 08:21.368
of invasive forces
from this place.

08:22.234 --> 08:23.665
What is she doing here?

08:23.667 --> 08:25.431
Can't you see this is
a fucking religious ceremony

08:25.433 --> 08:26.698
you have zero respect for?

08:26.700 --> 08:27.999
Good show tonight.

08:28.001 --> 08:29.398
Liar. You didn't see it.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.698
Don't call people liars,
Becky, unless you know...

08:31.700 --> 08:34.198
Sorry, was anybody speaking
to you, Little Miss Tiffany?

08:34.201 --> 08:37.398
Huh? Tiff-a-ny.Tiff-a-ny.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.932
I can't believe you're raising our
daughter around a woman named Tiffany.

08:40.933 --> 08:43.265
- You're an angel.
- It's true. It's true.

08:43.268 --> 08:45.001
- Could you excuse us?
- Yes, excuse us, Tiff.

08:48.034 --> 08:49.034
What the fuck?

08:50.767 --> 08:54.199
- Where did you get these?
- Ya-ema requested these items

08:54.201 --> 08:56.565
to envision
the purity of people

08:56.567 --> 08:59.398
whose auras
we must investigate,

08:59.400 --> 09:02.498
before mistress Becky allows
them near the child.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.032
- Is this for real?
- It's just important that she feels safe

09:05.034 --> 09:07.266
when Tama is
with us, that's all.

09:07.268 --> 09:10.032
- So, you put a curse on me?
- No, no, no. We haven't cursed you yet.

09:10.034 --> 09:11.698
We probably won't
unless Ya-ema sees

09:11.700 --> 09:13.065
something in the smoke
that he doesn't like.

09:13.067 --> 09:14.899
This is sick. You are sick!

09:14.901 --> 09:16.867
That's not helping.
Can you just give us a minute?

09:17.600 --> 09:19.067
Goodbye, Tiffany!

09:22.167 --> 09:23.698
Don't be such a cunt, Beck.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.165
We must resume
our ritual.

09:29.167 --> 09:30.834
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
You were right.

09:31.667 --> 09:32.999
What can we do
for you, Daniel?

09:33.001 --> 09:34.832
I wanted you to see her.
It shouldn't be this difficult.

09:34.834 --> 09:37.034
I really want to see Tiffany.
Yuck.

09:38.368 --> 09:40.398
- To see your child.
- Ooh.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.366
Unless you'd rather walk out on
her, too, in which case...

09:45.533 --> 09:48.099
- How can you let yourself be like this around her?
- Hey, man. I'm working.

09:48.101 --> 09:49.765
And you said Tuesday,
not Friday,

09:49.767 --> 09:51.932
which, how am I supposed to keep track if
you're just gonna keep changing your mind?

09:51.934 --> 09:53.531
Well, I thought you'd want to
see her before going to Europe.

09:53.533 --> 09:57.398
Europe.

09:57.400 --> 10:00.034
Oh. I forgot. You're not going
to Europe. Did you know that?

10:03.734 --> 10:06.732
- Of course, I knew.
- Well, you didn't act like I was wrong when I said it.

10:06.734 --> 10:09.398
I was testing you. There is no European
tour. I would know if there was.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.099
- Oh, you would?
- Yeah. Because I would have packed a bag,

10:12.101 --> 10:15.368
which as you can see,
clearly I have not.

10:18.901 --> 10:20.533
Whoa.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.199
- What's that?
- You're a mess.

10:23.201 --> 10:26.099
- You're a mess. No, you're a mess.
- You're a mess.

10:26.101 --> 10:27.531
No, you're a mess.

10:27.533 --> 10:29.565
No, you're a mess.

finished rocking.

10:48.101 --> 10:49.567
Rocking and-a-rolling.

10:51.001 --> 10:54.431
Only problem is I did not get to
visit the other place with Ya-ema.

10:54.433 --> 10:56.266
Because old Danno came in,

10:56.268 --> 10:58.899
interrupted my spiritual
journey. It was postponed.

10:58.901 --> 11:00.398
So, we still got that
to tend to.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.932

balance... That's like fucked up!

11:16.533 --> 11:18.067
Hello! Exactly.

11:27.067 --> 11:29.032
You know you'll hate yourself forever
if you miss these years with her.

11:29.034 --> 11:31.465
- Ooh.
- Heavy shit, Dirtbag Danny.

11:31.467 --> 11:33.565
- Nobody calls me that anymore.
- This is the night show

11:33.567 --> 11:34.999
- with DJ Dirtbag Danny,
- Ah.

11:35.001 --> 11:38.433

nasty rock you can only hear after dark.

11:40.034 --> 11:41.334

12:06.901 --> 12:08.332
Hmm.

12:08.334 --> 12:09.500
Hey.

12:10.533 --> 12:11.700
You seen Tiffany?

12:18.268 --> 12:19.899
You shouldn't come around here
and see her like this.

12:19.901 --> 12:21.400
What choice do I have?

12:22.567 --> 12:25.565
I'm the loser
who always crawls back.

12:25.567 --> 12:27.232
Twice, she fired me
from this tour

12:27.234 --> 12:30.034
and forgot about it the next morning.
We all crawl back.

12:36.067 --> 12:37.767
How much
is she paying the shaman?

12:39.533 --> 12:41.398
I'm not sure.
But in all likelihood,

12:41.400 --> 12:43.201
that answer would upset
you and me both.

12:43.767 --> 12:45.232
How's business?

12:45.234 --> 12:47.598
Euro tour's canceled but I
guess you already knew that.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.865
- Yeah.
- They're opening the vaults for an AP or something.

12:50.867 --> 12:54.199
Oh, if she's gonna fuck this
up for all of us it doesn't end well.

12:54.201 --> 12:55.431
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:55.433 --> 12:57.934
Yeah. And don't be
so negative.

12:59.767 --> 13:01.167
What's about?
You need cash?

13:01.934 --> 13:03.734
Tama needs more
than I can give.

13:04.734 --> 13:07.034
Becky has
to take responsibility, right?

13:08.467 --> 13:09.734
- May I?
- Sure.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.398
Howard might cancel the dates
we're holding for the new record.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.366
- He knows we're not ready.
- What does that mean?

13:19.368 --> 13:22.398
It means that I hope you have a plan
B to put this one in private school.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.199
Is she in breach?
Should I talk to someone?

13:24.201 --> 13:25.734
No. Our lawyer's got it
sorted out.

13:28.034 --> 13:29.934
No one's really expecting much
for her at this point though.

13:31.001 --> 13:32.332
She handed me
my walking papers,

13:32.334 --> 13:34.865
seven months later
she hands me Tama.

13:34.867 --> 13:36.767
Ever since then
my life's been a nightmare,

13:37.368 --> 13:38.400
in some ways.

13:39.201 --> 13:41.698
Wow. That's heavy-duty.

13:41.700 --> 13:44.167
It's my fault. I thought you two
would be a match made in heaven.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.899
I want her out now.
I want her out.

13:48.901 --> 13:51.632
- Fuck off! She has to go...
- You can't be serious.

13:51.634 --> 13:54.665
Now! We saw it in the smoke.
The child will be my downfall. Ya-ema...

13:54.667 --> 13:57.165
- I did not decree this.
- You did, you did, you did.

13:57.167 --> 13:58.598
You saw a prophecy when we
were in the other place.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.598
You said the child would
be my downfall.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.832
We have a lit stick of dynamite
that needs tossing out the tank!

14:02.834 --> 14:04.598
Becky, this is your child
we're talking about.

14:06.368 --> 14:09.865
Mistress Becky!
Mistress Becky!

14:09.867 --> 14:11.234
Look at my king.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.201
What do you see?

14:16.201 --> 14:17.400
Tell us.

14:18.934 --> 14:20.798
I see the void of eternity.

14:27.934 --> 14:31.266
- Hey. Hey!
- Howard! Howard.

14:31.268 --> 14:33.065
- They loved you.
- How are you?

14:33.067 --> 14:35.598
- And I love that they loved you.
- It was a good show, huh?

14:35.600 --> 14:37.732
Great.

14:37.734 --> 14:40.199
- Danny, what's happening?
- Holding it together.

14:40.201 --> 14:42.165
- You wouldn't understand.
- Oh.

14:42.167 --> 14:44.266
Uh, Becky, Zelda is waiting.

14:44.268 --> 14:46.498
Ah, fuck. I forgot.
What does that bitch want?

14:46.500 --> 14:48.398
- Easy, love.
- Express regards

14:48.400 --> 14:50.065
to your celebratory remarks.

14:50.067 --> 14:51.765
- Whatever.
- She said you were great tonight.

14:51.767 --> 14:55.565
What, did she just come here with fucking
obvious stuff that I already know or what?

14:55.567 --> 14:57.431
Of course, I was great.
I am always good.

14:57.433 --> 14:59.999
I believe I saw her
with an olive branch.

15:00.001 --> 15:01.832
Would I lead you astray?

15:01.834 --> 15:03.865
- No, Howard...
- Do it for me. Come on.

15:03.867 --> 15:05.665
She's not lying.
You were great tonight.

15:05.667 --> 15:07.266
She brings negativity.

15:07.268 --> 15:09.398
You see? You see?

15:09.400 --> 15:11.632
What is Zelda Ezekiel coming
and doing here anyways,

15:11.634 --> 15:14.531
coming backstage at our show when I'm trying
to spend quality time with my family,

15:14.533 --> 15:16.867
- and just demand an audience?
- Chill out, Beck.

15:17.667 --> 15:18.700
Zelda's all right.

15:20.901 --> 15:23.767
Yeah.

15:25.567 --> 15:27.665
Okay. Where is she, Howard?

15:27.667 --> 15:29.398
- Um...
- While we're on the topic,

15:29.400 --> 15:32.199
can you please tell me, are we doing those
recordings of our tracks like last time?

15:32.201 --> 15:34.765
Ali says you're doing an EP
instead of a whole record.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.765
Yeah, she, like, found some pretty
powerful stuff in the '92 sessions.

15:37.767 --> 15:39.398
Of course. Anything you need.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.567
- Can't get a fucking straight answer out of them, you know?
- Anything you need.

15:45.234 --> 15:46.698
That's because
you understand me, don't you?

15:46.700 --> 15:49.398
You really know I can't count
on anybody crazy.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.899
What kind of world is this when we
can't even get straight information...

15:52.901 --> 15:55.266
- Let's just say hello to Zelda.
- ...I'm recording an album.

15:55.268 --> 15:57.165
- Okay?
- Why do you insult me?

15:57.167 --> 15:59.099
- Well, I will sort it all out
- ...Or an E-fucking-P...

15:59.101 --> 16:01.498
- while you're meeting with her, okay?
- ...guitar or something?

16:01.500 --> 16:03.698
Just, dear, please, Howard.
Please just get me an answer

16:03.700 --> 16:05.232
and please make it
an honest one.

16:05.234 --> 16:07.732
She is very excited
to see everybody.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.765
- Everybody.
- Everybody.

16:09.767 --> 16:11.632
- Everybody? Wait, we're all going?
- Yes.

16:11.634 --> 16:12.732
Ooh!

16:12.734 --> 16:14.565
Why didn't you say so?

16:14.567 --> 16:19.698
I don't wanna do it alone.
Come to me, my ex...

16:19.700 --> 16:23.865
On the right, and to the left.
On the right, and to the left.

16:23.867 --> 16:26.232
To the right, and to the left.
To the right, and to the left.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.498
Oh, man, I wish
I had your patience.

16:31.500 --> 16:34.167
I'm a communicator.
I communicate.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.667
Anything I can do?

16:37.567 --> 16:38.834
Help her.

16:39.368 --> 16:40.565
That'll help me.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.567
I'm trying.

16:42.567 --> 16:44.065
Always trying.

from the comfort
of that chair, isn't it?

17:11.567 --> 17:15.397
This is my love, L-L-Lauren.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.397
Oh, what a beauty.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.232
Come on. Marie's told me
all about you.

17:20.233 --> 17:23.433
Ah! I can just go
if y'all want some alone time.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.598
Calm down, girl.

17:25.599 --> 17:28.899
What do we owe the
pleasure of your visitation?

17:28.901 --> 17:32.199
'Cause you're killers.
I want to see the new shit for myself.

17:32.201 --> 17:33.334
Well, what do you think?

17:35.634 --> 17:36.767
I'm green with envy.

17:38.368 --> 17:42.565
So, Howard said that you guys
are almost up in this one.

17:42.567 --> 17:44.932
Yeah, I don't know if I'm really feeling
the stage life, know what I mean?

17:44.934 --> 17:46.332
Why, what did he ask?

17:46.334 --> 17:49.332
I've got a string
of dates coming up.

17:49.334 --> 17:53.366
I was wondering if maybe you guys would
be, uh, interested in joining me.

17:53.368 --> 17:55.565
Oh, I don't know.

17:55.567 --> 17:56.865
What do you mean?
Like, opening act for you?

17:56.867 --> 17:58.232
That doesn't really make
any sense, don't you think?

17:58.234 --> 17:59.932
What is it, like,
six years ago?

17:59.934 --> 18:01.531
Oh, wait, if it was
six years ago,

18:01.533 --> 18:03.932
you'd be opening for M-E, me.

18:03.934 --> 18:06.765
And you would be trying
to run off with this one.

18:06.767 --> 18:08.700
Hey, when are the...
when are the dates?

18:09.767 --> 18:11.101
What are the dates?

18:19.600 --> 18:21.533
How about
a simple "No, thanks"?

18:22.867 --> 18:24.431
And thank you,
by the way, for coming

18:24.433 --> 18:26.901
to personally bitch slap us
in all of our faces.

18:28.167 --> 18:30.165
We do rock music
for rock people.

18:30.167 --> 18:31.865
And didn't I hear
that on your last record,

18:31.867 --> 18:34.732
you didn't even have
any guitars?

18:34.734 --> 18:36.498
I will never

18:36.500 --> 18:39.334
- share a stage with you.
- Fucking be careful with that shit!

18:41.167 --> 18:42.167
It's fine.

18:43.167 --> 18:44.201
March-ish.

18:45.067 --> 18:47.067
Hey, don't fucking
talk to her.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.232
Don't even look at her.

18:49.234 --> 18:52.765
Here's an idea. How about you
march-ish right out of this room

18:52.767 --> 18:56.366
into your limousine and take
that fucking offer with you?

18:56.368 --> 18:58.498
We need a break, not a tour.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.398
We just finished this one
like, what, an hour ago.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.099
Who's interested
in another tour?

19:08.201 --> 19:09.901
You brought me
on my first tour, Beck.

19:10.734 --> 19:11.901
I'll never forget it.

19:14.234 --> 19:15.901
Look, I'm not your enemy.

19:16.433 --> 19:18.032
I never was.

19:18.034 --> 19:20.398
Despite what you think
happened at the festival thing.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.700
You're gonna make me beg to
get you to bury the hatchet.

19:23.334 --> 19:24.533
Listen to me.

19:26.867 --> 19:28.067
Your music

19:29.234 --> 19:30.567
used to be awesome.

19:32.067 --> 19:33.899
And now it sucks.

19:33.901 --> 19:35.598
So, I don't
wanna tour with you.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.400
And now you come to bury me?

19:39.834 --> 19:42.366
I mean, I think I can speak
for all of us when I say

19:42.368 --> 19:44.598
that we have zero interest
in retreading the past,

19:44.600 --> 19:46.201
which includes
your fabled support.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.565
As I am trying

19:48.567 --> 19:50.999
to move forward here,
not backwards,

19:51.001 --> 19:53.500
which means I don't wanna
slip down your fucking bill.

19:54.433 --> 19:55.899
I mean, don't you have, like,

19:55.901 --> 19:59.865
the next generation of pansy,
art rock babes

19:59.867 --> 20:01.999
who are just dying
to share your light?

20:02.001 --> 20:03.498
Why don't you ask one of them?

20:03.500 --> 20:05.498
Because my answer is no.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.899
And where I go, they go.

20:08.901 --> 20:11.099
- I should go.
- Babe, don't go.

20:11.101 --> 20:13.398
Stay, please. I feel
like we're not...

20:13.400 --> 20:15.398
You're one of a kind,
I'll give you that.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.834
That's right, it's an original,
stick to your guns and your roots...

20:20.901 --> 20:24.531
<i>♪ P-U-R-E spells Becky ♪</i>

20:24.533 --> 20:27.767
- You are fucking lovely.
- So, do we have a deal?

20:28.700 --> 20:30.398
Howard, how could you?

20:30.400 --> 20:33.232
- You set me up. I trusted you.
- Now, I thought you might feel this way

20:33.234 --> 20:34.865
but just hear us out. Okay?

20:34.867 --> 20:38.099
It's not what you're thinking.
It's not gonna be clubs. It's theaters.

20:38.101 --> 20:39.665
- Theaters.
- It's an intimate tour.

20:39.667 --> 20:42.732
It's fuckin' boring.
It's really boring. Pass.

20:42.734 --> 20:44.765
- Well, I'm sorry you feel bad.
- God, if you're not gonna leave,

20:44.767 --> 20:47.431
I will. I have an interrupted
journey to complete.

20:47.433 --> 20:50.865
And, by the way, you are all
being incredibly rude to Ya-ema

20:50.867 --> 20:52.700
in the spiritual calm
that he requires.

20:53.934 --> 20:55.867
I am not done with you.
You are in big trouble.

20:59.934 --> 21:02.498
- Becky?
- Having fun in Becky-town?

21:02.500 --> 21:03.834
Whatever could you mean?

21:04.734 --> 21:05.734
Say it.

21:06.901 --> 21:08.732
- It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
- Just say it.

21:08.734 --> 21:09.834
It's nothing.

21:11.901 --> 21:12.934
Hey.

21:23.167 --> 21:25.065
Who is Ya-ema?

21:25.067 --> 21:27.433
Uh, Sauron,
the all-seeing guru.

21:28.934 --> 21:29.934
I'll go.

21:31.034 --> 21:32.600
Yeah, I think
that might be for the best.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.065
I'm so sorry.

21:36.067 --> 21:38.266
It was worth a shot though.

21:38.268 --> 21:40.732
Maybe we should...
take another swing

21:40.734 --> 21:43.268
when she's not so... so...

21:44.234 --> 21:45.400
I can't find the word.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.732
Door's open. I'm all ears.

21:49.734 --> 21:52.067
You know, you used to pack
places twice this size.

21:52.901 --> 21:54.465
What happened?

21:54.467 --> 21:58.400
Canceling tours, twice, at the last
minute has, oh, untested side-effects.

21:59.001 --> 22:00.101
It'll be fine.

22:03.767 --> 22:05.099
If you change your mind...

22:05.101 --> 22:07.899
Cold smothered crap,
you're still here?

22:07.901 --> 22:10.531
Jesus Christ, take a hint.

22:10.533 --> 22:14.199
Zelda has left the building!

22:14.201 --> 22:16.765
The Legend of Zelda
is stink to the air,

22:16.767 --> 22:20.531
has come to an E-N-D,
if you please.

22:20.533 --> 22:22.366
I'm leaving. Don't overreact.

22:22.368 --> 22:25.366
I hardly think I'm overreacting.
I'm just normal reacting.

22:25.368 --> 22:27.531
I'm sorry to be so fucking...

22:27.533 --> 22:30.698
Hey, this was entirely my idea.
Don't blame her.

22:30.700 --> 22:33.498
- Just let me take her. Let me take her.
- No, stop it.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.165
No, you shouldn't
be holding her in this state.

22:35.167 --> 22:36.431
What, is that
the state of rage,

22:36.433 --> 22:38.065
or the state of New York?
'Cause I don't know where I am.

22:38.067 --> 22:40.598
- Let me take her.
- ...fucking clown...

22:40.600 --> 22:44.065
Wee! Oh!

22:44.067 --> 22:47.598
That was a fun ride.
Wanna go on another sky ride?

22:47.600 --> 22:50.531
- Huh? With Mommy?
- Fucking mess!

22:50.533 --> 22:53.431
Perhaps we should all retreat
to our separate rooms for a bit?

22:53.433 --> 22:56.232
Aren't you enjoying the show?
Huh, you got nothing to see now?

22:56.234 --> 22:57.832
- Come on, it's fine.
- It's all right.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.732
- Her job at the mall...
- No. Not right now, not with us.

23:00.734 --> 23:03.498
- Am I running my mouth? Am I saying things I might regret?
- No, stop. Don't. Enough!

23:03.500 --> 23:06.099
Why don't you... if you run you
can catch up with Zelda, huh?

23:06.101 --> 23:09.531
She's boring and easy and fun.
And isn't that what you want?

23:09.533 --> 23:11.099
- Beck, don't.
- Yeah.

23:11.101 --> 23:12.765
Don't what?

23:12.767 --> 23:15.531
Chill. BECKY: And what,
show everyone a G-O-O-D time?

23:15.533 --> 23:17.398
Huh? Come here, baby.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.899
Tough job, but somebody's gotta do
it, you know?

23:19.901 --> 23:21.732
I gotta get out of here.
I've got to go to Becky's room.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.165
This stinks of Zelda's shit.

23:24.167 --> 23:27.834
Bitch, you would do... Hibbidah hibbidah
hibbidah. That's all fuckin' bullshit.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.565
Wee!

23:31.567 --> 23:33.167
- You all right?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

23:33.734 --> 23:34.767
I'm fine.

23:45.634 --> 23:47.665
Becky, you're okay, sweetie.

23:50.533 --> 23:51.899
Beck, come on. Come on, Beck.

23:51.901 --> 23:55.234
Come on, Beck.

23:56.901 --> 23:59.199
Daddy, daddy!

23:59.201 --> 24:00.667
- Her head.
- What's wrong?

24:01.500 --> 24:04.032
Good girl.

24:04.034 --> 24:05.901
Good girl, come on.

24:09.067 --> 24:11.533
Not right now.

24:12.400 --> 24:16.334
We go way beyond.

24:17.700 --> 24:21.500
We go way beyond.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.999
I can't believe
you're doing this to my child.

24:30.001 --> 24:32.665
What are we supposed to do
with it, though? I don't really know.

24:32.667 --> 24:33.934
Well, just hang it. What do you
mean, "What are we supposed..."

24:34.467 --> 24:35.765
Here you go.

24:35.767 --> 24:37.999
Yeah!

24:38.001 --> 24:39.665
I mean, we are the first

24:39.667 --> 24:42.332
and only girl band to ever
sell this many records.

24:42.334 --> 24:45.565
I'd like to say...

24:45.567 --> 24:46.865
Oh, shit!

24:55.400 --> 24:57.067
We're never gonna
make a record this good again.

24:57.400 --> 24:59.199
Ki-bash!

24:59.201 --> 25:00.500
Oh!

25:02.567 --> 25:03.934
Howard!

25:04.767 --> 25:06.498
We need a new one.

25:06.500 --> 25:09.366
We have another one.

25:09.368 --> 25:12.099
- I'm not touching that.
- Wait, wait, wait...

25:12.101 --> 25:13.268
We're sorry, sorry.

25:14.001 --> 25:15.567
Wait, get the record!

25:18.400 --> 25:20.999
Okay. I got it. I got it.

25:21.001 --> 25:22.368
Run, run, run, run.

25:45.700 --> 25:49.101
<i>♪ You rotted away</i>

25:50.834 --> 25:54.400
<i>♪ Tied to your own mistakes</i>

25:55.800 --> 26:01.400
<i>♪ I never wanted to be
that crutch for you</i>

26:05.667 --> 26:08.867
<i>♪ All in denial</i>

26:10.101 --> 26:14.067
<i>♪ With every word you breathe</i>

26:15.234 --> 26:20.867
<i>♪ I'm not to try
and piece it back for you ♪</i>

26:22.767 --> 26:26.199
I finally understand why you
begged me to stop checking in.

26:26.201 --> 26:28.632
That's a fucking bummer,
right?

26:28.634 --> 26:30.366
I told you you shouldn't
come back.

26:30.368 --> 26:32.765
I had to see for myself
who was occupying the studio

26:32.767 --> 26:34.431
that I had stopped paying for.

26:34.433 --> 26:36.531
Or did they not
give you the memo?

26:36.533 --> 26:37.932
Well, Becky
decided to pay for it

26:37.934 --> 26:42.101
and must have old you about it,
out of respect. I guess.

26:42.901 --> 26:44.101
Isn't that nice of her.

26:45.067 --> 26:48.165
I have this room booked
for my new group,

26:48.167 --> 26:50.366
but it's not yet vacated.

26:50.368 --> 26:51.765
That's why you came back.

26:51.767 --> 26:54.398
Did they not tell you
you needed to leave?

26:54.400 --> 26:55.698
Yeah. They did.

26:55.700 --> 26:56.901
And what did she say?

26:58.101 --> 27:00.999
I... I'd rather not repeat it.

27:10.867 --> 27:13.332
Well, if this is the best she's
got to show after nine months,

27:13.334 --> 27:15.865
I'm, I'm... I'm very screwed.

27:15.867 --> 27:19.099
We know you're out on a limb
for her on this, big time.

27:19.101 --> 27:22.398
Laid off workers
to cover overages,

27:22.400 --> 27:24.598
mortgage on my beach house.
I'm not out on a limb.

27:24.600 --> 27:27.431
I'm lying on the ground
next to the damn tree.

27:27.433 --> 27:29.266
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.

27:29.268 --> 27:33.932
Releasing their new album this year
would help cover your mess, if I could...

27:33.934 --> 27:37.032
What is this,
Talk and Tea time?

27:37.034 --> 27:38.099
Are we doing a session

27:38.101 --> 27:39.832
or is this
a goddamn book club?

27:39.834 --> 27:41.531
Jesus Christ!
Am I the only one...

27:41.533 --> 27:44.268
This is the first day in two weeks
she's been here for longer than an hour.

27:45.034 --> 27:46.867
Also, she came in at 2:00.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.266
- Well...
- AM.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.598
We've been here. She's
in the self-proclaimed groove.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.032
Show of hands.
Who is committed to greatness

27:54.034 --> 27:55.899
and will do whatever
it takes to achieve it?

27:55.901 --> 28:00.398
And a show of hands, who is lazy
and doesn't care about the music

28:00.400 --> 28:02.101
that we are recording here?

28:06.268 --> 28:08.268
That's one for greatness.
Anyone else?

28:10.700 --> 28:13.431
Thank you, Keith. It's nice
to know someone is on my side,

28:13.433 --> 28:16.032
the winning side.
And we all know who writes history.

28:16.034 --> 28:18.032
You all can just go home
and take a nap or something

28:18.034 --> 28:21.199
'cause your level of
dedication has been exposed.

28:21.201 --> 28:22.732
Right, Howard?

28:22.734 --> 28:25.932
Did you come to check up
on your prized project?

28:25.934 --> 28:27.865
Thank you for giving us
some space lately,

28:27.867 --> 28:29.165
but I gotta tell you,

28:29.167 --> 28:32.732
I'm sorry, but it is
going terribly.

28:32.734 --> 28:36.431
- At best.
- Well, there is a solution to this.

28:36.433 --> 28:38.698
I just need to figure out
what it is.

28:38.700 --> 28:41.032
If we could all just take
a step back, and think

28:41.034 --> 28:43.366
- for a second.
- That is a grand idea.

28:43.368 --> 28:45.498
Why can't you two be
more like team players,

28:45.500 --> 28:47.332
- like Howard?
- Just give it a rest, lady.

28:47.334 --> 28:48.498
The show's exhausting.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.867
And I've seen it too many
times to stick for the finale.

28:51.567 --> 28:53.698
Sorry, what? What did you say?

28:53.700 --> 28:54.999
- She said that...
- No, I heard her.

28:55.001 --> 28:57.067
I just wanted to make sure
I heard her correctly.

28:59.533 --> 29:05.032
Ali darling, care to take it one more time
from the top with feeling, <i>s'il vous plait?</i>

29:05.034 --> 29:07.565
Look at yourself.

29:07.567 --> 29:08.767
Easy, now.

29:10.700 --> 29:14.431
Would Becky Something wither and die
if she interacted on an adult level?

29:14.433 --> 29:16.698
Okay.
Let's just be calm, all right?

29:16.700 --> 29:19.565
We can withdraw
to some neutral place,

29:19.567 --> 29:22.065
- and discuss a compromise, so that we can...
- Boring, Howard.

29:22.067 --> 29:23.901
- No, I'm fucking tired.
- We can work this out.

29:24.368 --> 29:25.531
Ali?

29:25.533 --> 29:27.531
Maybe she could make some
sort of grand final statement.

29:27.533 --> 29:31.199
What? Why? Why would
I explain myself to you,

29:31.201 --> 29:33.934
when you're only gonna
remember your version?

29:35.567 --> 29:36.901
I'm fucking done!

29:44.634 --> 29:45.700
She's still talking.

29:47.934 --> 29:48.934
She's leaving.

29:50.034 --> 29:51.334
That is hers though.

29:53.500 --> 29:56.832
And, oh,
I took care of this band

29:56.834 --> 29:58.567
while you took care
of yourself.

29:59.368 --> 30:01.332
I didn't want to be thanked.

30:01.334 --> 30:04.034
I didn't want the gloss.
That was your thing.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.034
You just plucked me into it.

30:06.767 --> 30:09.899
So, enjoy it. Have fun.

30:09.901 --> 30:11.901
Ali, come on. Don't...

30:17.533 --> 30:20.698
Well, that is just
as Ya-ema prophesied,

30:20.700 --> 30:22.932
and what a fitting moment.

30:22.934 --> 30:26.234
Just when I was seriously
doubting your commitment.

30:29.167 --> 30:33.431
It's been a rotten year
bringing this mongoloid to term.

30:33.433 --> 30:36.132
But I knew it. I knew it.
I knew today was gonna be the final straw.

30:36.134 --> 30:38.899
I knew it when I walked
in the D-O-O-R.

30:38.901 --> 30:42.700
There was a fetid stink
in the elevator, you know?

30:43.934 --> 30:47.165
Big whoop, right?

30:47.167 --> 30:50.398
Watch this, watch this.
Watch how quickly we're gonna bounce back.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.732
All right? You watch this.

30:52.734 --> 30:54.199
- You watching?
- I'm watching.

30:54.201 --> 30:55.268
Watch.

30:56.967 --> 30:58.567
Are you watching?

30:59.334 --> 31:00.334
I'm watching.

31:01.433 --> 31:03.398
I'm looking.

31:03.400 --> 31:05.099
Look, I'm Ali!

31:05.101 --> 31:08.932
Watch! I'm Ali now!

31:21.034 --> 31:24.398
- Excuse me.
- Wait, Mari. You can't just...

31:24.400 --> 31:26.400
Mari. Mari, don't just...

31:40.667 --> 31:41.834
Fucked up!

31:43.234 --> 31:44.368
You fuckin...

32:04.400 --> 32:07.334
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

32:21.533 --> 32:23.400
Hee-hee-hee...

32:34.101 --> 32:38.700
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

34:07.834 --> 34:10.067
Marielle, help.
Fuck, what a fuckin' honor.

34:10.934 --> 34:12.331
No, Mari's fine.

34:12.333 --> 34:15.331
Um, we're booked. I mean,
we were booked.

34:15.333 --> 34:18.431
- I don't... Howard said...
- Yeah, yeah, I heard. I mean, it's just a...

34:18.433 --> 34:20.032
It's just
a whole nightmare right now.

34:20.034 --> 34:22.732
Are you kidding? We only want this
place 'cause you guys record here.

34:22.734 --> 34:24.665
Yeah. Shameful to say,
it's like an honor

34:24.667 --> 34:27.032
to be bumped by Something
She, like, the top.

34:27.034 --> 34:29.498
- Sorry, I'm a little nervous.
- No, no, that's all right.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.867
I mean, it's just a terrible
time to join a woman in.

34:33.766 --> 34:35.333
She's all gone,
like the worst she's ever gone.

34:39.433 --> 34:42.331
- Keith, where's Howard?
- He's in the back office.

34:42.333 --> 34:43.632
You might wanna check on him.

34:43.634 --> 34:45.500
He doesn't look good,
and I think he's dry-heaving.

34:47.500 --> 34:48.734
See, exactly.

34:49.867 --> 34:52.565
I mean,
not to get too deep, but...

34:52.567 --> 34:53.931
She's, like,
falling apart big time now,

34:53.934 --> 34:56.498
so, maybe actually...

34:56.500 --> 34:58.433
We move out and you
girlies just take over.

35:03.901 --> 35:06.667
<i>♪ Because you're young</i>

35:08.567 --> 35:11.368
<i>♪ Sharp as a knife</i>

35:13.433 --> 35:16.734

35:18.001 --> 35:21.500

35:23.201 --> 35:25.867

35:41.567 --> 35:43.867
Fuckin'. She's the queen.

35:44.867 --> 35:46.765
No, I won't let her
hear you say that.

35:46.767 --> 35:48.500
Actually, does she even know
you're even here?

35:49.734 --> 35:50.734
Unclear.

35:52.533 --> 35:54.032
So, I don't know
if she's gonna be into that.

35:54.034 --> 35:56.767
I mean, the behavior in here's
been, shall I say, erratic lately.

35:57.600 --> 35:58.999
Erratic on a good day.

35:59.001 --> 36:01.400
- On a bad day?
- They're all bad days nowadays.

36:06.967 --> 36:09.268
Well, it seems like
we have a logjam.

36:09.967 --> 36:11.932
We're all family here.

36:11.934 --> 36:15.299
Business family. One
big, happy business family.

36:15.301 --> 36:18.765
- Um, yeah, you know, if there's like a problem...
- Nonsense. No problem at all.

36:18.767 --> 36:21.132
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

36:21.134 --> 36:22.698
We'll record your album.

36:22.700 --> 36:25.999
We'll release it.
Everything will work out easy as pie.

36:26.001 --> 36:27.867
Becky... Becky'll understand.

36:29.433 --> 36:32.067
Uh, I also think she knows
we're here now.

36:33.567 --> 36:34.700
Oh, yeah.

36:54.533 --> 36:56.034
Here she comes.

37:18.467 --> 37:20.001
Who the fuck are
these bitches?

37:20.533 --> 37:21.867
The Aker girls.

37:23.867 --> 37:27.732
Did I not send you their
seven inch... You're gonna love them.

37:27.734 --> 37:29.832
You're gonna
love them. They're...

37:29.834 --> 37:32.099
Yeah,
I've signed them. And...

37:32.101 --> 37:36.498
We're not interrupting, so, like,
no disrespect Ms. Something.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.565
We're huge fans.

37:37.567 --> 37:39.531
And as thrilling
as it is to see your...

37:39.533 --> 37:44.366
Your passion and commitment, I was
counting on the studio being free by now.

37:44.368 --> 37:47.199
I... perhaps,
it's my mistake.

37:47.201 --> 37:49.734
- Because I haven't exactly been around.
- You cut us off.

37:51.433 --> 37:53.598
They tried to evict me.

37:53.600 --> 37:57.232
- Why would you do that to us, Howard?
- It's a misunderstanding.

37:57.234 --> 37:59.431
I was giving you
space and freedom

37:59.433 --> 38:01.101
without my breathing
down your neck.

38:01.901 --> 38:03.598
You know?

38:03.600 --> 38:06.698
And I did what I had to do
to tighten my belt

38:06.700 --> 38:08.234
but can you blame me?

38:12.101 --> 38:14.366
- Did you know about this?
- Nope.

38:14.368 --> 38:16.700
We just showed.
She had no idea.

38:35.034 --> 38:36.834
Howard, you fucking genius.

38:42.101 --> 38:44.366
What are the odds?

38:44.368 --> 38:49.165
What are the odds that we would find
ourselves one apple short of a bushel,

38:49.167 --> 38:52.165
and you would unknowingly
bring me a solution

38:52.167 --> 38:54.934
to all of
the world's problems?

38:57.034 --> 38:58.400
Who plays the drums?

39:06.334 --> 39:09.398
Are the rest
of you ready to jam?

39:09.400 --> 39:14.065
Because if I had to guess, I would say
that we are 15, maybe 20 minutes away

39:14.067 --> 39:17.498
from pure magic exploding
into this room.

39:17.500 --> 39:19.732
And silly me, I lost a drummer

39:19.734 --> 39:21.834
on the way
to grandmother's house.

39:23.201 --> 39:26.067
Here I thought we'd have to
scrap paper and go home.

39:27.334 --> 39:28.665
And what should
happen instead,

39:28.667 --> 39:31.899
three witches come
to my rescue.

39:31.901 --> 39:34.598
Look at all of you.
Just look at you.

39:34.600 --> 39:39.366
My god, you're so beautiful.
You're stunning.

39:39.368 --> 39:42.700
I'm Crassie Cassie,
this is Dottie OZ, and Roxy Rotten.

39:43.867 --> 39:46.234
She's the life of the party
and we'd be honored.

39:46.667 --> 39:47.700
Cut the shit.

39:49.334 --> 39:52.565
Come on, you're making me feel
like I'm a hundred years old.

39:52.567 --> 39:54.832
But goddamn, I just
really feel a connection

39:54.834 --> 39:56.698
to you babes, you know?
You feel that, Mari?

39:56.700 --> 39:58.266
Yeah, Beck, I feel it.

39:58.268 --> 39:59.531
I've been out here feeling it.

39:59.533 --> 40:01.698
It feels like I were waiting
for you to fucking feel it.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.101
And that's
what I'm talking about.

40:03.734 --> 40:04.934
Howard, my goodman.

40:05.734 --> 40:07.531
I'm ready to party.

40:07.533 --> 40:10.332
Let's make an album because
I have been sent some angels

40:10.334 --> 40:12.865
to work the angles, you dig?

40:12.867 --> 40:16.431
And what better way
to introduce new...

40:16.433 --> 40:19.498
...blood into
this turgid process,

40:19.500 --> 40:23.334
than actual new blood?

40:24.767 --> 40:26.999
Let's bathery these bitches.

40:27.001 --> 40:30.500
Learn a thing or two about what
the kids are feeling nowadays, huh?

40:31.734 --> 40:33.001
Inward, ho.

40:36.067 --> 40:37.533
Keith,
can you give us a minute?

40:41.134 --> 40:42.366
What the hell are you doing?

40:42.368 --> 40:44.431
Well, it looks like
I'm saving your asshole

40:44.433 --> 40:47.498
and keeping
this record on schedule.

40:47.500 --> 40:51.099
Don't you worry about reimbursing
me for the studio, it's my treat.

40:51.101 --> 40:52.465
I can't afford
another eight months,

40:52.467 --> 40:54.865
I will go bankrupt
while you finish your opus.

40:54.867 --> 40:57.565
I'm on my last credit line,
and you're on life no. 9,

40:57.567 --> 41:00.698
and these girls might
be our salvation.

41:00.700 --> 41:03.698
So, it would be swell if you didn't
torpedo them in the process of drowning.

41:03.700 --> 41:07.199
Howard, you confuse torpedoing,
which I don't know anything about,

41:07.201 --> 41:09.565
with making an album, which
you'll, if you'll excise me,

41:09.567 --> 41:13.665
I'm quite eager to resume
before my juices dry up again.

41:13.667 --> 41:14.999
Can you
make her aware?

41:15.001 --> 41:16.932
Ugh. What,
do I need a translator?

41:16.934 --> 41:19.398
I got it, loud and clear.

41:19.400 --> 41:20.899
It's ear
on the rear of a deer.

41:20.901 --> 41:23.431
Look, we don't need to do this.
We just fucking met 'em.

41:23.433 --> 41:24.765
We can take...

41:24.767 --> 41:26.734
...a day to regroup
and we can just call Ali.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.368
Who? Who?

41:31.268 --> 41:33.832
I don't know anybody
by that name.

41:33.834 --> 41:35.234
It's actually kind
of a funny name.

41:35.867 --> 41:37.099
If you think about it.

41:37.101 --> 41:38.167
Except if you're a Muslim.

41:43.500 --> 41:44.500
Mari.

41:45.734 --> 41:47.001
My love.

41:49.001 --> 41:50.268
You have my attention.

41:53.001 --> 41:54.167
And I, yours.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.099
Is there something
that you wanted to say,

42:01.101 --> 42:03.600
or was that just
a challenge to a duel?

42:05.433 --> 42:06.734
We don't get another chance...

42:09.101 --> 42:10.199
...if we fuck this up.

42:10.201 --> 42:12.398
Sorry, if you fuck this up!

42:12.400 --> 42:13.901
If you'll
fucking fuck this up,

42:16.700 --> 42:18.034
it's bye-bye, Something She.

42:20.134 --> 42:21.398
You dig?

42:21.400 --> 42:22.567
That's
the short of it.

42:31.934 --> 42:33.368
I'm gonna finish the record.

42:34.767 --> 42:35.767
You have my word.

42:37.567 --> 42:39.067
Cross my heart
and hope to die.

43:01.101 --> 43:03.600
♪ ...Three, four,
skip to my Lou...

43:10.433 --> 43:13.032
It's over.

43:13.034 --> 43:14.832
That's that.

43:14.834 --> 43:18.067
I trusted you to be alone
and you burned down the house.

43:18.700 --> 43:19.934
Oh, god.

43:21.134 --> 43:23.400
Yeah, I'll... I'll sort it.

43:24.734 --> 43:26.798
Look, the lioness is...

43:26.800 --> 43:28.199
You know,
seen threatening cubs.

43:28.201 --> 43:29.698
She's forcing them
into the pride

43:29.700 --> 43:31.433
rather than killing 'em
and eating 'em.

43:33.034 --> 43:34.398
Can you handle her?

43:34.400 --> 43:36.832
I mean, it's been nearly seven years.
What's another seven days?

43:36.834 --> 43:38.734
Yeah. If we wanna
run without Ali, I...

43:40.433 --> 43:41.765
I can't help you.

43:41.767 --> 43:43.232
But I need you.

43:43.234 --> 43:44.533
Yeah, I got this, man.

43:47.234 --> 43:48.400
Do you need
your rocket fuel?

43:50.334 --> 43:51.834
Yeah, I need
all the help I can get.

44:19.734 --> 44:20.767
Hi.

44:21.901 --> 44:22.901
Hi.

44:29.301 --> 44:30.734
Are you okay to do this?

44:33.967 --> 44:35.167
Any second now.

44:36.567 --> 44:37.567
I'll be fine.

44:45.234 --> 44:46.268
Can you give me a minute?

44:48.700 --> 44:49.700
Yeah.

45:22.268 --> 45:23.732
All right, who's ready
to do this shit?

45:23.734 --> 45:28.099
- Anything you say.
- Easy, easy. Easy there. It's simple as that.

45:28.101 --> 45:29.832
I'm comfortable
in a leadership role

45:29.834 --> 45:31.665
but let's slide
into this hot spring.

45:31.667 --> 45:33.765
Do you want us to look at any
sheets or just follow along?

45:33.767 --> 45:37.332
Oh, you chicks read music?
Fuck, what a loser I am.

45:37.334 --> 45:39.199
Well, there's some pieces
we've been playing with,

45:39.201 --> 45:41.598
but doesn't it make more sense
not to rely on old scraps,

45:41.600 --> 45:43.498
and start a feast
with a new family instead?

45:43.500 --> 45:44.999
The album's written
if that's what you mean.

45:45.001 --> 45:47.732
Let's hit it. Whatever you need.
Just, uh, say the word.

45:47.734 --> 45:49.665
Yeah,
there is an album.

45:49.667 --> 45:53.698
There's some music, but, you
know, maybe that's the problem.

45:53.700 --> 45:55.598
It's cursed.
It's done to death.

45:55.600 --> 45:58.232
There's a new sound.
Let's see what the kids are doing.

45:58.234 --> 46:01.400
- What, just play?
- Could I have made myself any clearer? Yes, play!

46:03.567 --> 46:05.867
I mean, if we're gonna be working
together, let's see what you've got.

- All of you?

48:09.901 --> 48:11.498
Brilliant.

48:11.500 --> 48:14.099
I've always longed
for that kind of connection.

48:14.101 --> 48:16.667
You know? But for some reason,
it just never worked.

48:17.368 --> 48:18.665
I just always did it.

48:18.667 --> 48:19.934
<i>♪ All by myself ♪</i>

48:23.368 --> 48:26.032
Oh, sure, Mari. Your contributions
have been, you know, helpful.

48:26.034 --> 48:28.732
But I'm talking about, like,
a ground-up collaboration.

48:28.734 --> 48:30.598
- Yeah.
- I wish I could give it to you now

48:30.600 --> 48:32.366
but, I just, I know
myself too well,

48:32.368 --> 48:34.398
and it's you know,
highway or her way.

48:34.400 --> 48:36.332
We're gonna jam,
you know, back you up.

48:36.334 --> 48:38.199
- Anything.
- It's what I need, followers.

48:38.201 --> 48:40.598
Silent peons
to worship at my feet.

48:40.600 --> 48:43.032
Ladies, ladies,
what harmony you have found

48:43.034 --> 48:45.465
within one another.
What spirit shared

48:45.467 --> 48:48.234
and just divided three ways.

48:49.034 --> 48:51.498
God, it is
the rarest of things

48:51.500 --> 48:53.999
that should not
be taken lightly.

48:54.001 --> 48:56.165
Capture it, my sisters,
hold on to it,

48:56.167 --> 48:59.665
and then never, never release
that bond you share.

48:59.667 --> 49:01.201
Wise advice
from a true original.

49:02.600 --> 49:04.201
Are you fucking kidding me?

49:05.901 --> 49:07.765
You know, I hope you girlies
don't buy this bullshit.

49:07.767 --> 49:09.433
I mean, you seem smart.
Smarter than me.

49:10.368 --> 49:12.366
Dumb old merry
grade-A sucker.

49:12.368 --> 49:15.234
Bought it, hook, line, and sinker.
Fool me once, shame, shame, shame.

49:15.934 --> 49:17.201
Sorry, what?

49:18.767 --> 49:23.531
I mean, who better
than the great Becky Something

49:23.533 --> 49:25.565
to dispel wisdom
on the value of others,

49:25.567 --> 49:27.598
who does more
to express appreciation

49:27.600 --> 49:29.698
and dedication to those
you fucking support.

49:29.700 --> 49:31.400
I support.

49:32.533 --> 49:34.932
This is not a two-a-day
two-way street, darling.

49:34.934 --> 49:36.400
No, it's a dead end, darling.

49:37.201 --> 49:39.698
It is a dead end.

49:39.700 --> 49:41.199
Mari, Mari, better be careful,

49:41.201 --> 49:43.199
or you're gonna offend
our guests.

49:43.201 --> 49:45.232
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

49:45.234 --> 49:47.531
We can just leave,
you know?

49:47.533 --> 49:50.165
We don't wanna be flies on the
wall while you sort this stuff out.

49:50.167 --> 49:51.932
See? Now look
what you've fucking done.

49:51.934 --> 49:53.565
Alienating the acolytes.

49:53.567 --> 49:54.899
Vanquish the venerating.

49:54.901 --> 49:57.065
Exile the exuberant.

49:57.067 --> 49:59.598
This is a blessed thing.
It's the next.

49:59.600 --> 50:02.665
Hold them close we should,
not exile them.

50:02.667 --> 50:03.999
This is in poor taste.

50:04.001 --> 50:06.266
Yeah. It always is.

50:06.268 --> 50:07.268
And then it's not.

50:07.867 --> 50:09.665
Run away. Flee!

50:09.667 --> 50:13.498
Flee! Big Bad Bossy Becky

50:13.500 --> 50:15.332
Get the bullshit out of here.

50:15.334 --> 50:18.201
It belongs... it belongs
on fucking Mars.

50:20.700 --> 50:24.565
Enjoy it because...
'Cause it could be fun. Enjoy it.

50:24.567 --> 50:26.700
Well, that's the first logical
thing I've heard all day.

50:45.667 --> 50:48.334
All I ever ask is for a little
respect, you know?

50:51.767 --> 50:54.433
If you can't get that in the
workplace, then where can you get it?

50:56.634 --> 50:57.734
You dig, right?

51:03.067 --> 51:05.767
Mush. You will mush.

51:06.600 --> 51:08.865
- Mush! Mush, mush.
- Okay.

51:08.867 --> 51:13.565
Onward, into the future.
Beep-beep!

51:13.567 --> 51:15.665
Okay. You know what,
I think we should just come back.

51:15.667 --> 51:17.032
This doesn't seem
like the right time...

51:17.034 --> 51:18.765
Night time is the right time.
Bed ways is the right way,

51:18.767 --> 51:20.132
so tally-ho.

51:20.134 --> 51:23.201
Not that we're not
organized product. We are, of course.

We can give you your space.
This must not be super easy.

51:54.867 --> 51:56.932
Wrong.

51:56.934 --> 52:00.498
I am the heart and soul
of this band.

52:00.500 --> 52:03.332
Hello, I named it
after myself.

52:03.334 --> 52:07.865
I found those girlies, and they were not
the first, and they will not be the last.

52:07.867 --> 52:09.398
I put Something She together

52:09.400 --> 52:12.032
from the ashes
of failed junk bands,

52:12.034 --> 52:14.165
wanting to have
something in my own name,

52:14.167 --> 52:17.533
like God spewing mankind.

52:19.368 --> 52:22.332
That's ancient history,
and so are those ungrateful wenches

52:22.334 --> 52:24.366
who suckled
at the teat of success

52:24.368 --> 52:26.698
that I placed
upon their mouth.

52:26.700 --> 52:28.932
Before we embark
upon this journey,

52:28.934 --> 52:30.698
promise me one thing.
Show me honesty,

52:30.700 --> 52:32.531
and I will do the same,

52:32.533 --> 52:36.165
because that is the pillar
of my music.

52:36.167 --> 52:38.032
So, enough
with this jibber-jabber

52:38.034 --> 52:39.732
and let's rock!

52:39.734 --> 52:42.334
And that sums it up
in one big lump.

52:46.533 --> 52:47.932
What should we do?

52:47.934 --> 52:51.431
Well, for starters, go into that
booth, and wake those turds up,

52:51.433 --> 52:53.899
and tell them it's blast off
to the fucking stars.

52:53.901 --> 52:55.665
We gonna hit
the fucking switch

52:55.667 --> 52:58.334
because the circus is leaving
town and it ain't coming back.

53:00.201 --> 53:02.698
We'll go get
the rest of our gear?

53:02.700 --> 53:03.767
Oh, yeah!

53:31.368 --> 53:33.431
You know,
you can't be fully acquainted

53:33.433 --> 53:35.667

Becky, tell them.

55:26.700 --> 55:28.765
It's basically,
you're our mum, too, aren't you?

55:28.767 --> 55:29.999
Yes!

55:30.001 --> 55:32.899
- Oh, she's so nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

55:32.901 --> 55:35.366
- She's so nervous.
- Mom, shut up. I'm not nervous.

55:35.368 --> 55:38.698
- I'm just trying to practice.
- I'm really happy you're here.

55:38.700 --> 55:40.167
- I'm...
- Thank you, Mom!

55:41.268 --> 55:44.531
This is so much fun.

55:44.533 --> 55:46.934
Oh, God, you're so amazing.
I'm so proud...

56:23.034 --> 56:24.498
Hey, you seen Becky?
She checked in yet?

56:24.500 --> 56:25.500
Nah, man.

56:28.834 --> 56:29.834
Hey.

56:31.700 --> 56:33.598
How's my grandbaby?

56:33.600 --> 56:36.032
She's at home with Tiffany.
She's miserable.

56:36.034 --> 56:38.201
- Her mom's a deadbeat who never calls.
- Poor Daniel.

56:39.034 --> 56:40.867
Drawn into family saga.

56:43.934 --> 56:45.234
I'm her new family.

56:46.867 --> 56:48.565
Life goes on.

56:48.567 --> 56:49.567
Hopefully it does.

56:53.433 --> 56:54.500
She's not here.

56:55.034 --> 56:56.366
Everybody's looking.

56:56.368 --> 56:58.732
What happened
to my baby Rebecca?

56:58.734 --> 57:00.867
Did I do something that wrong?

57:03.268 --> 57:06.266
Daniel, everything
we've been put through,

57:06.268 --> 57:07.268
and for what?

57:08.567 --> 57:10.665
- For love?
- Ah, yes.

57:10.667 --> 57:12.201
For love.

57:14.067 --> 57:16.199
- She in here?
- No.

57:16.201 --> 57:18.398
We're 40 minutes behind.
Venue's lights out at midnight.

57:18.400 --> 57:21.567
Don't set your watch
to Becky-time.

57:23.234 --> 57:25.398
What are we doing here?
She won't perform.

57:25.400 --> 57:26.600
Yeah, she has to.

57:27.567 --> 57:28.732
She has to? Why?

57:28.734 --> 57:31.667
Well, we got a bad feeling
this is it for Becky.

57:32.867 --> 57:35.899
She's opening in a small venue
with proteges.

57:35.901 --> 57:37.934
She's sold out arenas.

57:39.400 --> 57:41.832
Why do you fall for it?

57:41.834 --> 57:46.732
She cut the head off our life
together swiftly, and with no mercy,

57:46.734 --> 57:48.867
and apparently I'll never
come to terms with that.

57:51.767 --> 57:54.834
She's way behind
what we agreed on for Tama.

57:57.433 --> 58:01.366
I've been trying
to get her and these

58:01.368 --> 58:04.334
in the same room
for three months.

58:06.268 --> 58:08.932
Her lawyer quit. He called me.

58:08.934 --> 58:13.067
Yeah, her plan is to ignore anybody
suing her until they give up or die.

58:16.734 --> 58:18.533
Yep.
I should have knocked.

58:19.368 --> 58:21.498
- Alexandra.
- You fell for it!

58:21.500 --> 58:24.065
She'll be here.
She will be here.

58:24.067 --> 58:25.832
Ooh, where do
you find the faith?

58:25.834 --> 58:28.832
It's a curse. If you have anything to
have, it'll never be weighed.

58:28.834 --> 58:30.865
I cannot believe
I got talked into this.

58:30.867 --> 58:32.899
- She needs you.
- Yeah, no, every bully needs

58:32.901 --> 58:36.067
a weak punching bag to swing
back for one more smack.

58:37.034 --> 58:38.767
No one cares about
the players, right?

58:40.334 --> 58:41.567
They're just here for Becky.

58:42.700 --> 58:44.067
I mean,
what am I gonna do, quit?

58:45.533 --> 58:46.700
Be a nobody?

58:47.600 --> 58:50.065
I don't even belong
in this world.

58:50.067 --> 58:52.400
I used to play church basements
and I was happy there.

58:55.834 --> 58:57.368
Never even played
venues this big.

58:59.234 --> 59:00.234
Really big.

59:01.533 --> 59:02.901
A block from the underground.

59:04.201 --> 59:07.667
Footnote in the defining
oral history of the era.

59:08.934 --> 59:09.934
Fuck.

59:12.500 --> 59:14.398
We all rely on her
for something.

59:14.400 --> 59:15.934
We rely on Ms. Something
for something.

59:16.567 --> 59:17.734
Fame.

59:18.400 --> 59:19.567
Work. Glory.

59:20.134 --> 59:21.767
Money. Love. Support.

59:23.034 --> 59:24.765
Opportunity.

59:24.767 --> 59:27.332
Our golden goose sprays
golden piss in our faces.

59:27.334 --> 59:29.234
She supported me
for many years.

59:30.067 --> 59:31.167
Yeah, me too.

59:32.034 --> 59:33.101
What a wretched feeling.

59:33.767 --> 59:34.767
As you know.

59:40.201 --> 59:43.201
And such is the end
of the saga of Something She.

59:44.067 --> 59:45.201
Ignominious.

59:45.867 --> 59:46.867
Fitting.

59:47.767 --> 59:49.531
So, let's go.

59:49.533 --> 59:51.734
I'm gonna
go talk to security.

59:54.600 --> 59:55.698
She ain't here.

59:55.700 --> 59:57.598
Fuck. Fuck, I fucking knew it.

59:57.600 --> 59:59.665
- No, I think she's gonna show.
- Don't fucking touch me.

59:59.667 --> 01:00:01.101
That's the spirit.

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:06.531
Dirtbag Danny,
it's really you!

01:00:06.533 --> 01:00:07.732
It's just... just Danny.

01:00:07.734 --> 01:00:09.565
Dude, I taped
your show religiously,

01:00:09.567 --> 01:00:11.099
- like, every night, bro. Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

01:00:11.101 --> 01:00:13.667
I don't even have the early tapes.
You got some special stuff there.

01:00:15.067 --> 01:00:16.598
Yeah, this is really
fucking great, but this is

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.765
kind of, like, a big
fucking deal for us, so.

01:00:19.767 --> 01:00:22.932
And don't mind me trivializing
your professional dilemma.

01:00:22.934 --> 01:00:25.999
I just... I've been in your shoes
more times than I can count.

01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:27.932
Can you give us
a success ratio? Anything?

01:00:27.934 --> 01:00:30.531
I mean, like, this is not okay.
This isn't okay.

01:00:30.533 --> 01:00:32.899
There's a plan, right? You make the plan,
you stick to it. It's written in ink.

01:00:32.901 --> 01:00:34.567
Hey, she will be here.

01:00:35.201 --> 01:00:36.598
Might be any second.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.899
Might be in two hours.

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:40.199
But, no, it's...

01:00:40.201 --> 01:00:44.598
it's really cool and all what you're
doing for Becky and me, I guess.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.398
But Beck's not used
to not headlining.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.934
So she forgets that
nobody waits for the opener.

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:50.867
All right. So what do we do?

01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:55.865
You got any
vocal warmups, or...

01:00:55.867 --> 01:00:57.834
I don't... I don't know
what your pre-show is.

01:00:58.567 --> 01:00:59.667
You wanna jam?

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.798
Or just, like make out?

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.832
This is beyond me, okay?

01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:05.565
Just find me when the nightmare's over.
I'm done.

01:01:05.567 --> 01:01:08.732
Oh, boy.
She needs this.

01:01:08.734 --> 01:01:11.266
She's going through
a lot. We all are.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:13.598
Shit's like wobbly with us,
you know? Heartbreak.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.268
Wiser folks have
tried and failed.

01:01:16.667 --> 01:01:19.765
But, pay, guys. I signed
the contracts for today.

01:01:19.767 --> 01:01:23.065
So, if she doesn't show,
you can sue her, too.

01:01:23.067 --> 01:01:24.999
And I think that'll make
a baker's dozen.

01:01:25.001 --> 01:01:28.598
Oh. Hi. Sorry. Um. Roxy.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.332
- Hi.
- That was Dottie, and this is Crassie.

01:01:31.334 --> 01:01:33.332
- Hi. Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

01:01:33.334 --> 01:01:37.065
Thanks for giving her this chance.
I know she doesn't make it easy.

01:01:37.067 --> 01:01:39.498
She'd do it for us.
Already did, actually. So.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.167
Oh, yeah? How'd you repay her?

01:01:41.934 --> 01:01:43.034
By fucking it up?

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.431
She'll be here.
It's a pattern.

01:01:46.433 --> 01:01:47.732
Thank you so much.

01:01:47.734 --> 01:01:50.266
Disappear, make you miserable,

01:01:50.268 --> 01:01:51.932
keep you waiting,

01:01:51.934 --> 01:01:53.366
then come back
when you're out of options.

01:01:53.368 --> 01:01:56.398
My mom wouldn't step foot
in a place like this, so.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.199
Well, I'm not just here to watch
Becky inflict pain on others.

01:02:00.201 --> 01:02:02.268
We have enough of that
to last lifetimes.

01:02:04.334 --> 01:02:05.732
- Nothing?
- Nada.

01:02:05.734 --> 01:02:08.565
This is great!

01:02:08.567 --> 01:02:10.899
Well, that's it.
I'm done. It's over.

01:02:10.901 --> 01:02:14.999
She has cost me a house,
half my company.

01:02:15.001 --> 01:02:18.266
Can anyone here accuse me
of not trying hard enough?

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:21.132
Have I not provided
opportunity after opportunity,

01:02:21.134 --> 01:02:22.500
and this is how it ends?

01:02:24.234 --> 01:02:25.667
Ah, forgive me. Ania.

01:02:27.533 --> 01:02:29.266
- You know it, and I know it.
- Lovely to see you.

01:02:29.268 --> 01:02:31.266
Thanks.

01:02:31.268 --> 01:02:33.734
At this point, does it even
matter if we wait any longer?

01:02:35.667 --> 01:02:37.565
We were supposed
to go on five minutes ago.

01:02:37.567 --> 01:02:40.266
We're going on hour two
of a sold-out crowd waiting

01:02:40.268 --> 01:02:41.899
- for something to happen.
- I am deeply sorry.

01:02:41.901 --> 01:02:43.366
How could I know?

01:02:43.368 --> 01:02:47.832
Start the show!

01:02:47.834 --> 01:02:49.398
All right, we'll give her
ten more minutes.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.899
No, make that five.
Then, it's over.

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:53.899
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

01:02:53.901 --> 01:02:56.832
You know no one wants this night
to come off more than I do, but...

01:02:56.834 --> 01:02:58.565
Hey, you want to flip for it?

01:02:58.567 --> 01:02:59.899
I don't suppose
there's any benefit

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:02.999
in an Ali van der Wolff
acoustic solo set.

01:03:03.001 --> 01:03:06.065
At this point, anyone on stage but
Becky is only gonna make matters worse.

01:03:06.067 --> 01:03:07.834
Oh, I figured as much.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.832
So, what now?

01:03:11.001 --> 01:03:12.001
Wait.

01:03:24.767 --> 01:03:25.834
She's here.

01:03:38.268 --> 01:03:40.398
I always tried to do what was
best for my baby girl.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.565
Music lessons,
drives to concerts.

01:03:44.001 --> 01:03:45.732
Start the fucking show!

01:03:45.734 --> 01:03:47.431
Start the fucking show!

01:03:47.433 --> 01:03:49.932
Get on the fucking stage!

01:03:49.934 --> 01:03:52.034
Becky?

01:03:52.934 --> 01:03:54.099
Becky!

01:03:54.101 --> 01:03:57.232
Ding dong,
and the bitch is back!

01:03:57.234 --> 01:03:59.665
Show of hands,
who missed me?

01:03:59.667 --> 01:04:03.834
- Two hours.
- Two minutes till midnight!

01:04:08.268 --> 01:04:11.598
Hey, you're actually suing me, right?
Or is that somebody else?

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.199
- I'm suing you.
- I'll see you in court.

01:04:14.201 --> 01:04:17.201
Judge! Your Honor!

01:04:18.234 --> 01:04:21.698
Is it a crime
in this country

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.832
to prefer the witching hour?

01:04:23.834 --> 01:04:26.431
I was born
with an internal clock.

01:04:26.433 --> 01:04:29.368
The doctor left it
inside me.

01:04:30.234 --> 01:04:34.232
I call to the stand my mother,

01:04:34.234 --> 01:04:36.932
Mrs. Ania Adamcyzk.

01:04:36.934 --> 01:04:38.767
Nee Smolenska...

01:04:40.268 --> 01:04:41.600
"Mrs. Adamcyzk,

01:04:42.767 --> 01:04:45.398
"do you swear solemnly
that your daughter was born

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.065
"with a rare
neurological condition

01:04:47.067 --> 01:04:50.366
"that renders the passage
of time and enforced illusion

01:04:50.368 --> 01:04:52.899
"from the external world?"

01:04:52.901 --> 01:04:56.598
"Judge, please. I just can't seem
to get going until later at night.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.065
"Do you think I wanna be late?

01:04:58.067 --> 01:05:01.268
"Those people deserve a show!

01:05:02.433 --> 01:05:04.999
"And you have no idea the hell
that I've been through.

01:05:05.001 --> 01:05:07.598
"I am wishing there was any
way on earth I could get going

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.165
"but I just don't think
I'm gonna make it."

01:05:09.167 --> 01:05:11.698
Promise me, Mama, when I die,

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.366
have the coffin arrive
half an hour late,

01:05:13.368 --> 01:05:16.266
and on the side,
written in gold the letters of the words,

01:05:16.268 --> 01:05:17.867
"Sorry for the delay."

01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:22.199
Rebecca. My sweet Rebecca.

01:05:22.201 --> 01:05:25.199
Mom, stop it. You're
embarrassing me in front of my friends.

01:05:25.201 --> 01:05:26.865
I told you to wait in the car.

01:05:26.867 --> 01:05:28.531
They're making
a movie about me,

01:05:28.533 --> 01:05:30.099
and I want them
to see, like, the real me,

01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:33.132
so ixnay on the ebecca-ray,
okay?

01:05:33.134 --> 01:05:35.266
How can you
inflict such pain?

01:05:35.268 --> 01:05:38.431
Can you fucking stop
it with the dramatics, Mom?

01:05:38.433 --> 01:05:41.431
I haven't seen you in months,
you want to play this now?

01:05:41.433 --> 01:05:44.899
Don't be ungrateful.
Tell me I was always there.

01:05:44.901 --> 01:05:46.232
You're right.
You deserve a pass.

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:48.065
'Cause you were
in the fucking trenches, lady.

01:05:48.067 --> 01:05:49.999
You really were, you know?

01:05:50.001 --> 01:05:51.167
And you were alone,
weren't you?

01:05:52.767 --> 01:05:54.431
Weren't you?

01:05:54.433 --> 01:05:55.834
You remember
how alone you were?

01:05:57.268 --> 01:05:58.565
You remember?

01:05:58.567 --> 01:06:02.533
You remember how you were
always, always alone?

01:06:07.634 --> 01:06:10.065
Your father wanted
you to have this.

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:12.667
Where was he 15 years ago,
when I was nobody but his daughter?

01:06:15.368 --> 01:06:17.500
Great! Throw it in the trash.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:24.398
- How is married life, Dirtbag?
- Get out of my face.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.232
- We should go.
- Hey, hey, hey, stay, babes.

01:06:27.234 --> 01:06:29.266
Your loyalty will be rewarded.

01:06:29.268 --> 01:06:32.431
That's how it works.
Isn't that right, Ali?

01:06:32.433 --> 01:06:34.232
It's funny. I didn't
know you saw me here.

01:06:34.234 --> 01:06:37.199
Kid, your energy is
so fucking foul,

01:06:37.201 --> 01:06:38.934
I could see you in the dark.

01:06:41.667 --> 01:06:45.266
- Don't be mad.
- No, I'm not mad.

01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:47.932
- Come on, I'm ready.
- Yeah, you ready to rock?

01:06:47.934 --> 01:06:50.999
I was born ready.
Doesn't everyone know that by now?

01:06:51.001 --> 01:06:53.765
What, do you think I need to
warm up like some mere mortal?

01:06:53.767 --> 01:06:55.034
I don't think so, Tim.

01:06:56.034 --> 01:06:57.598
I wouldn't step foot
in this joint

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.765
if I wasn't ready
for v-v-victory!

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:04.199
Children, come here.
Come here.

01:07:04.201 --> 01:07:08.899
Join me in the sacred circle
for a spiritual cleanse.

01:07:08.901 --> 01:07:10.567
Where's the third member
of your coven?

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.832
Dottie OZ, you get your butt
in here this instant,

01:07:15.834 --> 01:07:17.433
or you are grounded!

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:19.500
How am I doing, Mom, huh?

01:07:22.334 --> 01:07:23.700
Mother of the year, right?

01:07:25.734 --> 01:07:26.734
Finally.

01:07:27.667 --> 01:07:30.531
Hah, come here,
come here. Finally.

01:07:30.533 --> 01:07:32.368
Join the circle
of energy, come on.

01:07:32.867 --> 01:07:34.398
Come on.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:38.065
Anybody who does not
want to be here, look away.

01:07:38.067 --> 01:07:40.999
Or you can leave. Not you.
Come here, come in.

01:07:41.001 --> 01:07:42.201
Get in there, yeah.

01:07:42.667 --> 01:07:43.667
Good.

01:07:49.167 --> 01:07:52.034
Dear goddess
of creativity and positivity,

01:07:53.034 --> 01:07:57.099
Becky here. How's it going?

01:07:57.101 --> 01:07:59.232
I am speaking to you tonight,

01:07:59.234 --> 01:08:01.232
not only on behalf of myself

01:08:01.234 --> 01:08:03.232
but on behalf
of my little sisters,

01:08:03.234 --> 01:08:06.700
Dottie OZ, Crassie Cassie
and Roxy Rotten.

01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:09.498
It's a big night for them,

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.067
so let's take care
of our Aker girls.

01:08:14.001 --> 01:08:16.500
They're swell kids.

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:18.500
They deserve the best.

01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:22.201
As for me,

01:08:23.234 --> 01:08:24.234
I need this.

01:08:25.767 --> 01:08:26.767
I need this bad.

01:08:29.001 --> 01:08:30.433
'Cause this is it
for old Beckster.

01:08:33.033 --> 01:08:35.299
Last train is
leaving the station,

01:08:35.301 --> 01:08:37.232
and if I'm not on it
when the whistle blows,

01:08:37.234 --> 01:08:38.399
that's it for me.

01:08:39.533 --> 01:08:41.999
Lights out, last call,
soup's cold,

01:08:42.001 --> 01:08:43.500
ice cream's melting.

01:08:44.234 --> 01:08:46.033
Beer's warm. Yuck.

01:08:48.567 --> 01:08:49.667
Let's rally...

01:08:50.433 --> 01:08:51.433
One more time.

01:08:54.201 --> 01:08:56.001
And you can take
that soul I promised you.

01:09:01.368 --> 01:09:03.032
Did you get it?

01:09:03.033 --> 01:09:05.398
Perfect. Start with that,
it'll be fucking phenomenal.

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:07.832
Now let's burn
this fucker down

01:09:07.834 --> 01:09:10.834
for the big finish!

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.430
All right. Let me...

01:09:15.433 --> 01:09:16.901
- Let me go tell them you're ready.
- Fuck yeah!

01:09:19.368 --> 01:09:21.399
Another poor decision.
I'm leaving.

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:25.867
I'll join you
in a moment.

01:09:27.067 --> 01:09:29.198
Make sure
that she gets these.

01:09:29.201 --> 01:09:30.934
Yeah. You're not gonna...
you're not gonna watch the show?

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:33.334
No.

01:09:34.167 --> 01:09:36.564
I don't wanna see
what happens next.

01:09:36.567 --> 01:09:39.332
But I have one thing that
I need to say to my daughter.

01:09:39.334 --> 01:09:40.834
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Yeah.

01:09:42.934 --> 01:09:44.001
Let's make it sooner.

01:09:46.201 --> 01:09:47.901
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.567
Well,
have a great show.

01:09:55.334 --> 01:09:56.533
Is she gonna be okay?

01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:58.467
No, she's not.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:03.099
I don't know. Um...

01:10:03.101 --> 01:10:05.400
Guys, I know that you don't
need a fucking...

01:10:06.433 --> 01:10:08.565
Uh, listen
to an old has-been like me,

01:10:08.567 --> 01:10:09.865
but you're gonna
kill it tonight,

01:10:09.867 --> 01:10:11.767
and after tonight, just...

01:10:12.767 --> 01:10:14.700
Please love each other.

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:18.700
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.

01:10:19.734 --> 01:10:21.431
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:10:21.433 --> 01:10:22.433
Yeah.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.767
So, is there something
we should do?

01:10:40.667 --> 01:10:41.700
What else can we do?

01:10:43.201 --> 01:10:45.398
We shouldn't have asked her to
play tonight. She's not straight.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.268
No. I'm sorry,
we gave her a chance.

01:10:48.667 --> 01:10:50.165
Kill your idols.

01:10:50.167 --> 01:10:52.567
Give 'em enough rope
and they'll do it themselves.

01:10:54.234 --> 01:10:55.234
Right.

01:10:58.634 --> 01:11:00.167
I never even
wanted any of it.

01:11:00.934 --> 01:11:02.201
I just wanna rock with you.

01:11:05.734 --> 01:11:06.734
Where's my camera?

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.865
The fuck is
that still doing here?

01:11:22.867 --> 01:11:24.700
He has things
he wants to say to you.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:26.667
I see no harm in that.

01:11:28.767 --> 01:11:30.201
Do you understand forgiveness?

01:11:31.634 --> 01:11:33.268
Can you understand regret?

01:11:40.067 --> 01:11:43.433
You weak, stupid wimp.

01:11:49.167 --> 01:11:50.400
After everything

01:11:51.368 --> 01:11:52.667
he has put us through.

01:11:59.067 --> 01:12:00.433
He used to look up to you.

01:12:03.634 --> 01:12:04.934
He thought you were
better than this.

01:12:06.867 --> 01:12:08.268
Deep down I knew you weren't.

01:12:10.334 --> 01:12:12.700
You're more like your father
than you'll ever know.

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:20.368
Come on, let's go.

01:12:36.334 --> 01:12:37.334
Give it to me.

01:12:38.734 --> 01:12:39.798
Destroy it.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.366
Beck, stop!

01:12:41.368 --> 01:12:43.632
Becky, no.

01:12:43.634 --> 01:12:45.865
- Ow!
- Wipe this from the people.

01:12:45.867 --> 01:12:48.598
Let in the light
and forsake the darkness!

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.366
- Do it.
- Do you speak not to me.

01:12:50.368 --> 01:12:53.366
To hear your words is to
open myself to your trickery.

01:12:55.101 --> 01:12:56.698
I have fought you
in 11 other lives,

01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:59.698
in 11 other lives,
you have destroyed me.

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:01.400
Stop! You're hurting me.

01:13:02.101 --> 01:13:04.232
Fuck, fuck!

01:13:04.234 --> 01:13:06.665
I have lived across time
and I see how to defeat

01:13:06.667 --> 01:13:09.366
those who will
see me destroyed.

01:13:09.368 --> 01:13:13.199
For the first time,
I have the power to do what must be done,

01:13:13.201 --> 01:13:16.001
and for the last time
we struggle!

01:13:28.201 --> 01:13:31.433
Somebody, help.
Help me please.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.667
We're just in a...

01:13:39.934 --> 01:13:41.498
Be cool, all right. Be cool.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:42.932
No, no, no.

01:13:42.934 --> 01:13:44.400
- Raise your glass.
- Fuck!

01:13:48.533 --> 01:13:52.565
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

01:13:52.567 --> 01:13:55.465
Just take it easy.
Let's keep her okay, all right?

01:13:55.467 --> 01:13:57.999
- Hello!
- Howard!

01:13:58.001 --> 01:13:59.531
Please, stop her.

01:13:59.533 --> 01:14:04.167
Gentle with her!

01:14:04.901 --> 01:14:06.201
Just step back now.

01:14:27.167 --> 01:14:28.834
All right, okay.
Okay. Drop it.

01:14:29.734 --> 01:14:31.431
She dropped it.
She dropped it.

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:33.332
Can you not
hurt her please?

01:14:37.433 --> 01:14:39.334
Are handcuffs necessary? Look at her.

01:14:40.234 --> 01:14:43.167
Now, when do I get
my lousy phone call?

01:14:44.834 --> 01:14:46.867
Just leave her...
Fucking don't... She's...

01:14:52.934 --> 01:14:54.001
Take a step back!

01:14:57.767 --> 01:14:59.700
- Hey!
- It's fucking over!

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.533
Stop! I said stop filming!
Get out!

01:15:04.034 --> 01:15:05.700
Steven, can you stop them from filming?

01:15:08.334 --> 01:15:09.334
Get out of here!

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:12.500
Stop!

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:18.665
Becky?
Where are you...

01:15:18.667 --> 01:15:19.865
Ali?

01:15:19.867 --> 01:15:22.201
Becky? Beck...
Don't go out.

01:15:32.134 --> 01:15:36.567
Becky! Becky! Becky!

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:14.632
Do you ever get the feeling
you're being followed?

01:16:14.634 --> 01:16:16.498
Fuck yeah!

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.431
- I've been back through the ages of earth
- Back it up!

01:16:18.433 --> 01:16:21.598
and I've witnessed centuries
of conflicts.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.999
I've regressed to the moment
of my conception,

01:16:24.001 --> 01:16:26.765
- and I've watched myself being born!
- What the fuck?

01:16:26.767 --> 01:16:28.332
You know what?
That's why I'm leaving,

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:30.565
because when I needed it,

01:16:30.567 --> 01:16:32.531
nobody ever put
a hand on my back

01:16:32.533 --> 01:16:34.533
and told me it was
gonna be all right!

01:16:35.101 --> 01:16:36.234
Dude!

01:16:36.834 --> 01:16:38.732
It's the little things!

01:16:38.734 --> 01:16:40.232
The little things.

01:16:44.867 --> 01:16:46.034
Hold on, Becky.

01:16:47.901 --> 01:16:49.832
Oh shit!

01:16:49.834 --> 01:16:50.867
Come on, Becky.

01:17:29.001 --> 01:17:32.001
Sometimes I don't even
know myself. Mom?

01:17:33.767 --> 01:17:34.767
Mom?

01:17:35.667 --> 01:17:36.667
Mom?

01:18:20.268 --> 01:18:22.067
I wanna stay home
with my baby.

01:18:24.201 --> 01:18:25.934
No tour, no record.

01:18:28.001 --> 01:18:29.067
I like it here.

01:18:31.901 --> 01:18:35.865
See. You ready for me
to take her home now?

01:18:35.867 --> 01:18:39.167
All right, take her.
Take her, I'm too tired.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:42.567
I got you.

01:18:52.368 --> 01:18:53.600
Fuckin' tired.

01:22:12.533 --> 01:22:14.600
- Baby.
- Mommy.

01:22:26.834 --> 01:22:28.266
Momma missed you.

01:22:28.268 --> 01:22:29.901
I missed Momma.

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.032
Hey, kiddo, Mommy
and Daddy need to talk.

01:22:41.034 --> 01:22:42.567
Maybe you want
to play pinball?

01:22:43.234 --> 01:22:44.234
Yeah, okay.

01:23:15.368 --> 01:23:16.498
You look good.

01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:17.500
Bullshitter.

01:23:24.567 --> 01:23:26.199
I'll have a year next week.

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:27.201
I know.

01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:29.734
That's really great.

01:23:34.901 --> 01:23:36.400
She's been asking
about you all the time.

01:23:39.867 --> 01:23:41.001
She misses me?

01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:43.899
She doesn't really know you.

01:23:43.901 --> 01:23:46.567
She has no memory
of living with you.

01:24:02.634 --> 01:24:03.767
I had this dream.

01:24:05.934 --> 01:24:09.032
We were brothers
in a past life.

01:24:09.034 --> 01:24:11.398
And we were Native American.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:15.567
And you killed
all the children in our tribe.

01:24:19.034 --> 01:24:22.067
And that's why I was so
horrible to you in this life.

01:24:41.167 --> 01:24:42.498
Oh...

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:43.600
Before I forget...

01:24:48.467 --> 01:24:49.901
You need to look at those.

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.167
- I will.
- Today. I'm taking 'em back with me, so.

01:24:58.368 --> 01:24:59.767
Does it make a difference?

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.334
Yes. Yeah, it does.

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:08.734
Including you, do you know how
many lawsuits I have against me?

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.700
Yes, I do.

01:25:14.767 --> 01:25:16.201
Would you care
to say it out loud?

01:25:17.834 --> 01:25:19.001
Would it make a difference?

01:25:21.934 --> 01:25:23.500
Settling with M and A.

01:25:24.934 --> 01:25:26.001
Child support.

01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:29.034
Breach of contract. Contracts.

01:25:29.934 --> 01:25:31.934
Promoters. Howard.

01:25:35.101 --> 01:25:39.334
- I've lost track.
- Yeah, well, don't lump us in with all of that.

01:25:42.234 --> 01:25:43.234
There's nothing left.

01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:48.368
They gave me my band name
in exchange for publishing.

01:25:53.368 --> 01:25:54.867
I don't own my own music.

01:25:57.334 --> 01:25:58.334
I'm broke.

01:26:03.767 --> 01:26:05.201
I can't give you anything.

01:26:09.234 --> 01:26:11.065
I don't want you
to sell the house.

01:26:11.067 --> 01:26:13.034
I just need to know that...

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:17.433
Half of whatever dollars
you find go to Tama.

01:26:29.201 --> 01:26:30.767
I can't leave this house.

01:26:37.867 --> 01:26:39.834
I can't go back
into the world.

01:26:56.834 --> 01:26:57.934
Mari's here.

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:05.567
- Excuse me, what?
- She drove up with me. She's in the car.

01:27:12.201 --> 01:27:13.932
You shouldn't have done that.

01:27:13.934 --> 01:27:15.832
That's okay.
She just wants to talk.

01:27:15.834 --> 01:27:17.400
She took everything I built.

01:27:19.834 --> 01:27:21.034
She didn't take it.

01:27:22.201 --> 01:27:23.368
You lost it.

01:27:24.268 --> 01:27:26.734
And besides,
you built it together.

01:27:32.767 --> 01:27:34.268
Well, I can't
see her like this.

01:27:36.934 --> 01:27:40.067
She's sober, too. She's been
through it. She understands.

01:27:45.667 --> 01:27:47.201
Yeah. I just need a minute.

01:27:51.433 --> 01:27:53.934
Go get her, and count to 100.

01:28:16.001 --> 01:28:17.867
Momma, I lost my free balls.

01:28:23.334 --> 01:28:25.065
Come here.

01:28:25.067 --> 01:28:28.201
You're
getting big, kiddo.

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:30.932
What's Daddy feeding you?

01:28:30.934 --> 01:28:32.867
Chicken fingers
and fish fingers.

01:28:33.201 --> 01:28:34.832
Wow.

01:28:34.834 --> 01:28:36.531
I wish I had
some of those.

01:28:36.533 --> 01:28:37.667
And noodles.

01:28:40.567 --> 01:28:42.199
I don't know
if we have any of that,

01:28:42.201 --> 01:28:43.865
but if you're not too big,

01:28:43.867 --> 01:28:46.901
you know, I could maybe get you
some peanut butter and jelly.

01:28:48.268 --> 01:28:49.334
Peanut butter?

01:28:49.934 --> 01:28:51.067
All right, all right.

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.867
Play me a song, Mommy.

01:28:57.767 --> 01:28:58.865
What kinda song?

01:28:58.867 --> 01:29:00.400
A song that reminds you of me.

01:29:04.201 --> 01:29:06.667
A song
that makes me think of you.

01:29:07.834 --> 01:29:09.234
Hmm...

01:29:11.901 --> 01:29:12.901
Okay.

01:29:16.433 --> 01:29:18.101
- You ready?
- I'm ready-o.

01:29:20.901 --> 01:29:22.234

Hey, M.

01:33:48.467 --> 01:33:49.500
Hey, B.

01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:57.732
Hey, Mari, did you hear?
Mom sang a song just for me.

01:33:57.734 --> 01:33:59.001
Oh, yeah. I heard.

01:34:00.967 --> 01:34:02.798
Sweetie, why don't you
come fix lunch with Daddy?

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:05.232
Mom said she'd make me
a sandwich.

01:34:05.234 --> 01:34:07.531
Dad can get this one.
I'll get the next one.

01:34:07.533 --> 01:34:09.899
Okay, Momma. But you have
to make the next one.

01:34:09.901 --> 01:34:10.934
Mm-hmm.

01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:33.334
She's so beautiful.

01:34:37.034 --> 01:34:39.032
I lost
so much time with her.

01:34:39.034 --> 01:34:40.533
Yeah, but she's lucky
to have you back.

01:34:41.667 --> 01:34:45.199
I had a vision of you
holding her at my funeral.

01:34:45.201 --> 01:34:47.167
I saw you
and Danny holding her hands.

01:34:48.433 --> 01:34:50.834
And I was so happy
that you were her godmother.

01:34:53.234 --> 01:34:55.199
I mean, I've seen
my death a dozen times

01:34:55.201 --> 01:34:57.199
in a dozen different ways.

01:34:57.201 --> 01:34:59.598
In every vision,
I'm surrounded by people.

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:00.834
I never die alone.

01:35:02.001 --> 01:35:03.167
Well, you're alone now.

01:35:05.101 --> 01:35:06.667
Beck, you should
leave this place.

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.667
There's an ache in my bones.

01:35:13.734 --> 01:35:15.234
Oh, presents from Howard.

01:35:18.234 --> 01:35:20.366
Thanks, Howard.
How's he doing?

01:35:20.368 --> 01:35:23.598
Yeah, well, actually,
the Aker girls are big.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:26.400
I mean, their new stuff ain't my cup
of tea, but they've done well for him.

01:35:27.433 --> 01:35:28.500
He'd love to see ya.

01:35:30.734 --> 01:35:33.167
Hey, thanks for taking
my call back then.

01:35:34.901 --> 01:35:36.101
Yeah, you didn't have to.

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.001
Yeah, I know.

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.767
I was
always the bigger person.

01:35:47.368 --> 01:35:48.400
Ali didn't.

01:35:49.368 --> 01:35:50.400
You didn't try to stab me.

01:35:52.533 --> 01:35:53.600
Except in the back.

01:35:54.667 --> 01:35:55.899
Yes, you did.

01:35:55.901 --> 01:35:57.266
How's she been?

01:35:57.268 --> 01:35:58.398
Good.

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.500
She's put out an album
with her husband and...

01:36:02.334 --> 01:36:03.533
it's pretty great.

01:36:05.533 --> 01:36:07.734
- Husband?
- Yeah, Roy.

01:36:08.667 --> 01:36:11.167
Yeah, they're
really amazing together.

01:36:11.667 --> 01:36:13.067
I should get a copy.

01:36:14.533 --> 01:36:17.034
- Well, I can just... Mine's in the car, so I can...
- I'll buy my own.

01:36:17.767 --> 01:36:19.368
All right. Okay.

01:36:22.767 --> 01:36:25.165
I don't think
she's mad at you anymore.

01:36:25.167 --> 01:36:27.867
I don't think I'm mad at you
anymore either. You were...

01:36:29.067 --> 01:36:30.201
You were horrible.

01:36:31.734 --> 01:36:34.533
But it never
made me not love you.

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:36.600
I'll always love you.

01:36:39.334 --> 01:36:41.001
Oh, man,
I fucking miss you, mate.

01:36:47.433 --> 01:36:48.567
Oh...

01:36:49.467 --> 01:36:51.167
Lauren's
seven months pregnant.

01:36:51.934 --> 01:36:53.700
Oh, I heard. Danny told me.

01:36:54.234 --> 01:36:55.366
Oh, that's rad.

01:36:55.368 --> 01:36:57.700
Yeah, it's crazy.
She's like so big.

01:36:59.034 --> 01:37:01.199
I'm so happy for you.

01:37:01.201 --> 01:37:02.865
You're gonna be
a really good mom.

01:37:02.867 --> 01:37:04.268
- You think?
- Yeah.

01:37:04.934 --> 01:37:06.001
Thank you.

01:37:09.101 --> 01:37:12.234
You... still jamming then?

01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:16.034
Just alone, you know.

01:37:16.368 --> 01:37:17.400
A lot.

01:37:18.001 --> 01:37:19.567
Well, do you wanna?

01:37:22.067 --> 01:37:23.334
Sure.

01:37:45.767 --> 01:37:48.101
Don't tell anybody
about what you hear, okay?

01:37:48.533 --> 01:37:49.765
No, I won't.

01:37:49.767 --> 01:37:52.234
Just like if anybody asks you.

01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:55.067
Does anybody ask?

01:37:57.567 --> 01:37:59.101
Not as much as they used to.

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:02.500
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:04.600
Only...

01:38:06.734 --> 01:38:08.332
Be kind, all right?

01:38:08.334 --> 01:38:10.032
Yeah, just between us.

01:38:10.034 --> 01:38:12.034
Yeah.
Just between me and you.

01:40:35.001 --> 01:40:40.268
<i>♪ I just want
to be in control of it</i>

01:40:42.901 --> 01:40:46.667
<i>♪ Control of it</i>

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:50.999

01:40:51.001 --> 01:40:54.268

<i>♪ I don't wanna quit</i>

01:40:56.500 --> 01:41:00.834
<i>♪ I just want
to be in control of it ♪</i>

01:41:11.901 --> 01:41:12.934
Just a little thing.

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:14.867
Mostly junk.

01:41:18.567 --> 01:41:21.334
I don't think I can let people hear this.
It's just too...

01:41:22.034 --> 01:41:23.165
Too much.

01:41:23.167 --> 01:41:24.368
So, what are you...

01:41:25.368 --> 01:41:27.398
Stay here
and die in this house?

01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:29.199
I always thought
I'd die on stage.

01:41:29.201 --> 01:41:31.832
There's nothing here that can hurt
me so I can't leave the house.

01:41:31.834 --> 01:41:33.565
- Or else...
- Or else what?

01:41:33.567 --> 01:41:36.431
Somehow I cheated it.
It's very real.

01:41:36.433 --> 01:41:38.266
It wasn't that time,
so maybe it'll be next time.

01:41:38.268 --> 01:41:40.865
- So there just can't ever be a next time.
- Nah, that's insane.

01:41:40.867 --> 01:41:41.867
No, it isn't.

01:41:44.067 --> 01:41:46.899
Ya-ema once told me
that Tama would be my downfall

01:41:46.901 --> 01:41:49.533
and I always thought he meant
that she would bring my downfall.

01:41:50.867 --> 01:41:53.332
And it wasn't until later
that I realized

01:41:53.334 --> 01:41:57.665
that he meant my love
for her is my true weakness.

01:41:57.667 --> 01:42:00.032
No, I don't buy any of that.

01:42:00.034 --> 01:42:01.732
You know, you shouldn't
still talk about him.

01:42:01.734 --> 01:42:03.431
He's a fraud and he took
advantage of you

01:42:03.433 --> 01:42:05.199
and lots of others,
and is in jail for it now.

01:42:05.201 --> 01:42:06.400
He understood me.

01:42:07.368 --> 01:42:08.567
All right, whatever.

01:42:10.767 --> 01:42:13.032
You know, you don't need him,
and you never did.

01:42:13.034 --> 01:42:15.099
You never knew
when to rely on others.

01:42:15.101 --> 01:42:16.234
That's your weakness.

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.565
You know, people are waiting.
They're waiting.

01:42:19.567 --> 01:42:21.965
They're waiting to see
who Becky Something really is.

01:42:21.967 --> 01:42:23.034
Who is she?

01:42:24.767 --> 01:42:25.865
She's a woman.

01:42:25.867 --> 01:42:27.032
- She's a user.
- A mother.

01:42:27.034 --> 01:42:28.498
- She's a deadbeat.
- A person.

01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:29.832
A persona.

01:42:29.834 --> 01:42:31.567
- But you're healthy.
- Recovering.

01:42:33.034 --> 01:42:34.034
All right.

01:42:35.201 --> 01:42:36.899
Well, who was Becky Something?

01:42:36.901 --> 01:42:38.899
A way to hide
from Rebecca Adamcyzk.

01:42:38.901 --> 01:42:40.398
- And who is she?
- I don't know.

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:42.500
Nobody has seen her
since I was 16.

01:42:43.834 --> 01:42:45.034
Momma, I'm bored.

01:42:47.067 --> 01:42:48.999
I know, sweetheart.

01:42:49.001 --> 01:42:51.266
Mommy's just catching up
with Aunt Mari.

01:42:51.268 --> 01:42:52.767
Can we go outside to play?

01:42:57.268 --> 01:42:58.400
Yeah.

01:43:01.034 --> 01:43:02.034
Let's go outside.

01:43:07.234 --> 01:43:08.234
Come on.

01:44:39.001 --> 01:44:41.498
It hurts.
That's how I broke my virginity.

01:46:05.767 --> 01:46:07.201
Yeah.

01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:11.167
- Awww.
- Look at you.

01:46:12.234 --> 01:46:13.234
Hi, baby.

01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:25.232
Is this a mistake?

01:46:25.234 --> 01:46:26.734
Nah. Feels good.

01:46:31.533 --> 01:46:33.034
- Yeah, it's pretty.
- Yeah.

01:46:34.067 --> 01:46:35.899
Yeah, it's pretty great.

01:46:35.901 --> 01:46:38.266
- Ah, you all look incredible.
- Oh.

01:46:38.268 --> 01:46:42.598
Christ... we're not
Lady Lazarus' damn phoenix.

01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:44.832
Oh, and this is my night.

01:46:44.834 --> 01:46:47.865
You tried hard as you could
to torpedo the business,

01:46:47.867 --> 01:46:50.965
but somehow the company has
survived for nearly 20 years,

01:46:50.967 --> 01:46:53.899
so let me throw a
living wake for you.

01:46:53.901 --> 01:46:55.765
Anybody mind if we
get a few quick photos over here?

01:46:55.767 --> 01:46:57.431
- Yes.
- Oh, that's why you're here.

01:46:57.433 --> 01:47:00.533
Oh, you didn't think I actually
wanted to see any of you? Come on.

01:47:02.767 --> 01:47:03.767
How's this take?

01:47:04.867 --> 01:47:06.368
Never seen
this place sober.

01:47:07.234 --> 01:47:10.067
Yeah, I told you.
It fuckin' sucks.

01:47:10.667 --> 01:47:11.667
Excellent.

01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:18.665
Hi.

01:47:18.667 --> 01:47:22.765
- I miss her.
- All right. I'm starting to feel like a specimen.

01:47:22.767 --> 01:47:25.268
We ran from the stage
when we heard you were here.

01:47:26.667 --> 01:47:27.901
Oh my god.

01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:29.500
Sit.

01:47:33.433 --> 01:47:35.498
So, how are things?

01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:37.101
Arms, our new record
just came out.

01:47:38.234 --> 01:47:40.234
Yeah. No, I know.

01:47:41.734 --> 01:47:43.665
Oh, I know.

01:47:43.667 --> 01:47:45.531
And it's
the best one yet.

01:47:45.533 --> 01:47:47.533
Everyone says the one we made
together was the best one.

01:47:48.934 --> 01:47:50.531
That's because
they're fucking assholes

01:47:50.533 --> 01:47:53.032
who don't want
artists to change.

01:47:53.034 --> 01:47:55.498
I'm serious. Do you know...
We have it on repeat.

01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:57.067
- I love it.
- Thank you.

01:47:57.667 --> 01:47:58.700
Appreciate it.

01:48:01.001 --> 01:48:03.500
Hey, what about you?
You doing anything after this?

01:48:04.268 --> 01:48:05.565
Tonight?

01:48:05.567 --> 01:48:07.232
No, like,
in the future.

01:48:07.234 --> 01:48:09.199
- Um...
- That's unknown.

01:48:09.201 --> 01:48:11.765
We're just trying to get
through tonight.

01:48:11.767 --> 01:48:13.700
How crazy is this?
You see Zelda's here?

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:16.232
- No.
- I'm sorry. Shit.

01:48:16.234 --> 01:48:18.199
Oh, man, no.
It's totally fine. It's cool.

01:48:18.201 --> 01:48:20.834
We, you know, we talked and she
heard what I had to say, so...

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:22.767
Actually, is she still around?

01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:24.734
Down the hall.

01:48:26.268 --> 01:48:28.899
Maybe this...
Maybe this means something.

01:48:28.901 --> 01:48:30.332
Yes.

01:48:30.334 --> 01:48:31.334
Excuse me.

01:48:34.334 --> 01:48:36.001
Something She?

01:48:36.734 --> 01:48:38.698
You're on in 20.

01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:41.398
It's so nice to see
you guys together.

01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:43.266
She looks
like she's doing great.

01:48:43.268 --> 01:48:46.099
Yeah. Yeah,
she actually is, I think.

01:48:46.101 --> 01:48:48.901
You know there's, like, a lot of shit
going on tonight, she cool with that?

01:48:50.201 --> 01:48:52.665
Yeah. I mean,
probably, maybe...

01:48:52.667 --> 01:48:55.099
- We'll see.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:48:55.101 --> 01:48:57.765
I mean, people are
getting really fucked up.

01:48:57.767 --> 01:48:59.498
- Yeah, we'll keep an eye on her.
- Yeah, we got her.

01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:00.500
Don't worry.

01:49:17.767 --> 01:49:18.767
Becky!

01:49:19.268 --> 01:49:21.165
Oh, fuck.

01:49:21.167 --> 01:49:23.101
- You look awesome.
- Yeah, Viv, I thought you'd be here.

01:49:24.334 --> 01:49:25.934
- For Howard, right?
- Yeah, right on.

01:49:27.567 --> 01:49:29.765
- You wanna hang?
- No, no.

01:49:29.767 --> 01:49:31.798
I just was looking for Zelda.

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:33.865
She's partying with us.
She just stepped out.

01:49:33.867 --> 01:49:35.199
Wait for her.

01:49:35.201 --> 01:49:38.234
No. No, I can't. But, um,
just tell her I was looking for her.

01:49:39.533 --> 01:49:40.665
It's good to see you.

01:49:40.667 --> 01:49:41.865
Yeah, yeah.

01:49:41.867 --> 01:49:43.199
You doing the thing after?

01:49:43.201 --> 01:49:45.867
Maybe. Probably not, because,
um, my daughter's here.

01:49:47.167 --> 01:49:48.398
- How's Tama?
- She's really good.

01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:50.332
She's good. She's really big.

01:49:50.334 --> 01:49:52.665
- She's like seven, so.
- I wanna see her.

01:49:52.667 --> 01:49:54.034
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'll...

01:49:54.567 --> 01:49:56.001
I'll come find you.

01:50:12.001 --> 01:50:13.065
Change your mind?

01:50:13.067 --> 01:50:15.500
No, I'm sorry.
I just didn't...

01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:17.834
I didn't realize it was...

01:50:20.101 --> 01:50:22.565
Becky Something,
as I live and breathe.

01:50:22.567 --> 01:50:24.498
Hey, Z.

01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:26.099
Yeah, I was
just looking for you.

01:50:26.101 --> 01:50:27.234
What's it all about?

01:50:28.034 --> 01:50:29.667
Hey, are you guys on soon?

01:50:30.834 --> 01:50:32.232
Well, well...

01:50:32.234 --> 01:50:33.899
Never thought I'd live
to see the day.

01:50:33.901 --> 01:50:35.433
Yeah, you and me both, girl.

01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:38.400
You look good.

01:50:40.101 --> 01:50:41.101
Really good.

01:50:41.901 --> 01:50:42.934
Um...

01:50:43.667 --> 01:50:45.431
You looking for me?

01:50:45.433 --> 01:50:48.366
Yeah. You can say no,
and you probably will,

01:50:48.368 --> 01:50:50.498
but I was just gonna have
a little seance right now.

01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:52.065
Just like a very pure,

01:50:52.067 --> 01:50:54.732
just trying to find a clearing
on my path before we, like,

01:50:54.734 --> 01:50:55.832
you know, do this thing,

01:50:55.834 --> 01:50:57.765
and I know
it's only this song...

01:50:57.767 --> 01:50:59.932
So you'd probably just...

01:50:59.934 --> 01:51:01.999
I wanted to be
surrounded by my...

01:51:02.001 --> 01:51:04.834
By some women, because I thought
that that might help with...

01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:06.500
Relax.

01:51:07.034 --> 01:51:08.034
I'd love to.

01:51:10.334 --> 01:51:11.934
- Yeah?
- It's cool.

01:51:12.901 --> 01:51:14.001
Time passes.

01:51:14.867 --> 01:51:15.867
Yeah.

01:51:17.001 --> 01:51:19.498
- Yeah, yeah, that's... All right. Cool.
- All right.

01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:20.934
Yeah. After you.

01:51:34.201 --> 01:51:35.767
I'm Rebecca Adamcyzk.

01:51:36.834 --> 01:51:38.167
I rely on the strength
of others for support.

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:43.500
Thank you all
for being here with me.

01:51:47.867 --> 01:51:49.500
Hi, I'm Mary Louise Hella.

01:51:51.867 --> 01:51:53.101

Thank you

I'm Alexandra Derringer.

01:52:06.834 --> 01:52:07.901
I'm here for you.

01:52:08.934 --> 01:52:10.368
Thank you all
for being here with me.

01:52:14.667 --> 01:52:16.234
I'm Caroline Sassinger.

01:52:16.734 --> 01:52:18.032
I'm here for you.

01:52:18.034 --> 01:52:19.368
Thank you all
for being here with me.

01:52:20.867 --> 01:52:22.431
I'm Danielle Zakian.

01:52:22.433 --> 01:52:25.101
I'm here for you. Thank you
all for being here with me.

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:30.767
I am Michelle White.

01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:33.498
I'm here for you.

01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:35.067
Thank you all
for being here with me.

01:52:36.767 --> 01:52:38.667
I'm Zelda Ellen Benson Harmon.

01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:40.834
And I'm here for you.

01:52:42.201 --> 01:52:44.065
Thank you
for being here with me.

01:52:44.067 --> 01:52:46.598
- Your name really is Zelda?
- Mm-hmm.

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:48.201
Fuck, that's so cool.

01:53:04.867 --> 01:53:06.500
No matter what happens next,

01:53:07.368 --> 01:53:09.700
thank you
for letting me be who I am.

01:53:11.334 --> 01:53:13.765
I've tried and I've tried
and I've tried,

01:53:13.767 --> 01:53:15.067
and you've all
stuck with me...

01:53:17.867 --> 01:53:18.867
Till the very end.

01:53:26.001 --> 01:53:27.001
Well...

01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:31.034
I better finish getting ready.

01:53:32.734 --> 01:53:35.201
- Thanks for letting me crash.
- You're very welcome.

01:53:37.734 --> 01:53:41.431
I, uh... I know I wasn't always
front row at the Becky show.

01:53:41.433 --> 01:53:44.232
Come on. You're backstage
at the Becky show.

01:53:44.234 --> 01:53:45.332
Yeah, you are.

01:53:47.767 --> 01:53:49.901
All right. See you in a few.

01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:54.032
Hey,
we should go chill.

01:53:54.034 --> 01:53:56.099
- I'm beat.
- We're watching her set though.

01:53:56.101 --> 01:53:59.598
Oh, shit, yeah. That's one
thing we absolutely cannot miss tonight.

01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:02.201
Wow. Well, I hope
we don't disappoint. Pressure.

01:54:02.734 --> 01:54:03.899
You never do.

01:54:07.667 --> 01:54:10.067
What did you think she meant
by "Until the very end"?

01:54:11.234 --> 01:54:12.600
It's just
something people say.

01:54:13.901 --> 01:54:15.400
Yeah, maybe. Or...

01:54:17.101 --> 01:54:18.366
What are you thinking?

01:54:18.368 --> 01:54:20.099
No. I mean,
what did we just do?

01:54:20.101 --> 01:54:21.500
What did Becky want from us?

01:54:22.201 --> 01:54:23.901
Strength to overcome, maybe.

01:54:25.101 --> 01:54:26.698
Yeah. Huh. Or...

01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:29.901
No. No, she's open.
Not high.

01:54:31.167 --> 01:54:32.400
She was good.

01:54:33.234 --> 01:54:34.332
Yeah.

01:54:34.334 --> 01:54:36.533
Yeah. Yeah, I hope you're right.

01:54:38.167 --> 01:54:39.700
No, of course, of course.

01:54:40.767 --> 01:54:42.032
All right. Enjoy the show.

01:54:42.034 --> 01:54:43.334
- Can I get one?
- Of course, yes.

01:54:44.101 --> 01:54:45.598
- Thank you.
- Danny! Bye guys.

01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:47.732
Hey, how's it going, Zelda.

01:54:47.734 --> 01:54:48.865
Great to see you.

01:54:48.867 --> 01:54:51.431
- Hi. You must be Becky's mother.
- Nice to see you.

01:54:51.433 --> 01:54:53.065
From the down the hall,
I could have sworn it was her.

01:54:53.067 --> 01:54:54.165
Oh, right.

01:54:54.167 --> 01:54:55.698
Hi, beauty.

01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:58.232
- And you remember my wife Tiffany?
- Congratulations.

01:54:58.234 --> 01:55:00.032
- Thank you.
- Look at you. Hi, love.

01:55:00.034 --> 01:55:01.099
- I'm Zelda.
- Roy.

01:55:01.101 --> 01:55:02.932
- Miss Z, can I get you anything?
- I'm sorry.

01:55:02.934 --> 01:55:04.400
No, I'm all right, love.
Thank you.

01:55:05.201 --> 01:55:07.099
So, how's radio, Dirtbag?

01:55:07.101 --> 01:55:08.999
You know, it is good.
You know, we're merging

01:55:09.001 --> 01:55:11.332
with the competition.
Payout, can't complain.

01:55:11.334 --> 01:55:12.865
Have you seen the girls yet?

01:55:12.867 --> 01:55:14.932
I just came from their room, actually.
Want me to show you where it is?

01:55:14.934 --> 01:55:16.332
No, I think I can remember.

01:55:16.334 --> 01:55:17.932
- Okay.
- Are we supposed to go through the balcony?

01:55:17.934 --> 01:55:20.065
Oh, nonsense.
Come watch it from back here.

01:55:20.067 --> 01:55:22.332
I'll show you. Come on.
Come with me.

01:55:22.334 --> 01:55:25.732
Ali is such a great singer.
I always knew.

01:55:25.734 --> 01:55:27.832
I really love the album
you two did.

01:55:27.834 --> 01:55:29.999
- Ah, you're the one.
- Oh, stop it. Here it is.

01:55:30.001 --> 01:55:31.899
Guys, enjoy the show.

01:55:31.901 --> 01:55:33.366
Stop it, it's marvelous.

01:55:33.368 --> 01:55:34.899
- Seriously.
- Appreciate it.

01:55:34.901 --> 01:55:36.032
All right, enjoy.

01:55:36.034 --> 01:55:39.366
You all right?
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

01:55:39.368 --> 01:55:41.865
- Just who I wanted to see!
- Aunt Mari!

01:55:41.867 --> 01:55:43.465
- Where's Rebecca?
- Ah!

01:55:45.834 --> 01:55:48.765
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

01:55:48.767 --> 01:55:51.332
- Congratulations to you too.
- She's, um...

01:55:51.334 --> 01:55:53.266
She's just gone to unwind
or something before we play.

01:55:53.268 --> 01:55:55.032
- Oh, yeah? Which is when?
- Ten minutes.

01:55:55.034 --> 01:55:56.598
- Ten minutes.
- Yeah.

01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:58.531
I mean, she's probably
meditating or something.

01:55:58.533 --> 01:55:59.867
Something She?

01:56:01.101 --> 01:56:02.498
Eight minutes
until Something She.

01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:04.665
Eight! Geez, all right.

01:56:04.667 --> 01:56:06.165
Well, I'm gonna
go look for her.

01:56:06.167 --> 01:56:07.667
I love you. Wait here.

01:56:16.667 --> 01:56:18.334
- Mari, hey.
- Hey, V.

01:56:19.167 --> 01:56:20.899
- Have you seen Becky?
- I saw her.

01:56:20.901 --> 01:56:23.565
- When?
- Like two minutes ago in our room.

01:56:23.567 --> 01:56:26.032
- Okay. But you're all here.
- Yeah, I left.

01:56:26.034 --> 01:56:27.400
Right, but when did you go?

01:56:33.268 --> 01:56:34.565
I'm sure it's fine.

01:56:34.567 --> 01:56:37.398
- Did you see how stoned Vivvy was?
- Yeah. So, that's Vivvy.

01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:39.065
Becky shouldn't
be hanging with her.

01:56:39.067 --> 01:56:42.199
Okay, I think she just said,
"Hey Mar."

01:56:42.201 --> 01:56:44.232
Yeah, but it's not good to be
around her. It's not good.

01:56:44.234 --> 01:56:46.398
It's fine. Give her the benefit.
She's probably in her room.

01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:48.565
- No...
- Just... no. Then she's somewhere else.

01:56:48.567 --> 01:56:51.334
Look, just relax. You're just
nervous about the show.

01:56:51.934 --> 01:56:53.400
Did we lose Becky already?

01:56:55.167 --> 01:56:57.368
I mean, well, that is the
question at the moment, actually.

01:56:59.667 --> 01:57:00.834
I was joking.

01:57:02.433 --> 01:57:06.698
Oh, goddammit. Not this again.
One smooth night

01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:08.465
after all these years.
Is that too much to ask?

01:57:08.467 --> 01:57:10.032
Look, I'm sure
she's back right now.

01:57:10.034 --> 01:57:12.567
Oh. I'll just go,
say hello to Dick, all right?

01:57:14.334 --> 01:57:15.400
I'm having a stroke.

01:57:17.967 --> 01:57:19.065
Where is she?

01:57:19.067 --> 01:57:20.398
Uh, Tama had to use
the bathroom

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:21.565
so Ania said she looked there.

01:57:21.567 --> 01:57:22.834
The Aker girls?

01:57:23.533 --> 01:57:25.398
Uh, negative.

01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:26.765
I just saw them.

01:57:26.767 --> 01:57:28.932
All right, that's five minutes, folks.
Five minutes till show.

01:57:28.934 --> 01:57:30.101
- Thank you.
- Vivvy?

01:57:30.533 --> 01:57:31.533
Uh, no.

01:57:33.101 --> 01:57:35.400
We have to play.
So let's just...

01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:37.732
let's just go to the stage,

01:57:37.734 --> 01:57:39.565
and we'll find
Becky waiting there.

01:57:39.567 --> 01:57:41.400
- Okay?
- Yeah. Sure, we will.

01:57:50.533 --> 01:57:51.901
- Why don't you do your thing, okay?
- Okay.

01:57:53.101 --> 01:57:54.698
We'll go find our seats?

01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:56.101
- They're on...
- Seats? That way, yeah.

01:58:01.533 --> 01:58:04.366
Holy shit, look.
She's there. She's ready.

01:58:04.368 --> 01:58:05.698
All right, four minutes.

01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:08.165
- Fuck.
- Why is she standing like that?

01:58:08.167 --> 01:58:09.600
- I don't know.
- She's nervous.

01:58:10.433 --> 01:58:12.268
- I know I am.
- She's nervous?

01:58:14.034 --> 01:58:15.034
She's alone.

01:58:23.034 --> 01:58:24.498
- We need to get her out.
- Yeah.

01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:26.001
- Should I...
- Just us.

01:59:18.334 --> 01:59:19.334
Well?

01:59:20.368 --> 01:59:21.665
- She'll be fine.
- Three minutes.

01:59:21.667 --> 01:59:23.099
"She'll be fine." What does
that mean, "She'll be fine"?

01:59:23.101 --> 01:59:24.999
- She'll be fine.
- Is she straight? Is she messed up?

01:59:25.001 --> 01:59:26.065
- Can she perform?
- She's good!

01:59:26.067 --> 01:59:28.531
Greg, hey! Find Zelda.
See if she can get on.

01:59:28.533 --> 01:59:30.899
Zelda's not going on. We are.

01:59:30.901 --> 01:59:32.400
Then tell me,
what does this mean?

01:59:33.567 --> 01:59:35.667
It means whatever you want
it to mean, Danny Boy.

01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:41.533
Did she take something?

01:59:43.034 --> 01:59:44.665
- Guess what?
- Huh?

01:59:44.667 --> 01:59:45.734
Tama's here.

02:00:11.901 --> 02:00:14.431
I wanted to say good luck
before your concert, Mommy.

02:00:14.433 --> 02:00:15.700
Thank you, sweetheart.

02:00:17.034 --> 02:00:18.034
Thank you.

02:00:23.467 --> 02:00:25.600
Go to Daddy, okay? Go on.

02:00:39.167 --> 02:00:41.431
I just have to be me,
you know.

02:00:41.433 --> 02:00:45.199
And I know I've caused you
a lot of pain, I'm sorry.

02:00:45.201 --> 02:00:47.165
And I don't know
how to do it like that.

02:00:47.167 --> 02:00:48.999
For myself,
I don't know how to do it...

02:00:49.001 --> 02:00:52.001
I can't. I don't know
how to do it, I'm sorry.

02:00:53.001 --> 02:00:54.565
It's okay.

02:00:54.567 --> 02:00:56.565
Five seconds, guys.
Forty-five to show.

02:00:56.567 --> 02:00:58.398
Howard, are you gonna
introduce them in?

02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:00.201
- Here goes nothing.
- Oh, Becky.

02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:05.533
Becky, darling,

02:01:06.834 --> 02:01:07.834
are you okay?

02:01:10.234 --> 02:01:11.665
Thank you.

02:01:11.667 --> 02:01:12.700
Thanks very much.

02:01:14.101 --> 02:01:17.765
<i>I, uh... I first saw
this next band</i>

02:01:17.767 --> 02:01:19.865
<i>almost ten...</i>

02:01:19.867 --> 02:01:22.067
<i>God, no, eleven years ago.</i>

02:01:23.201 --> 02:01:24.934
<i>Uh, they were opening for...</i>

02:01:26.368 --> 02:01:28.232
<i>Well, it doesn't matter
who they were opening for,</i>

02:01:28.234 --> 02:01:30.232
<i>'cause I left
right after their set,</i>

02:01:30.234 --> 02:01:32.099
<i>ran backstage,
dropped to my knees,</i>

02:01:32.101 --> 02:01:34.368
<i>and begged
to let me sign them.</i>

02:01:35.834 --> 02:01:38.999
And... And this woman,

02:01:39.001 --> 02:01:41.531
<i>this once in a lifetime,
never been anyone like her in the world,</i>

02:01:41.533 --> 02:01:45.099
<i>firebrand of a woman.
Her hair dyed bright blue.</i>

02:01:45.101 --> 02:01:48.201
Rebecca never knew how to go
out there, exposed and alone.

02:01:49.001 --> 02:01:50.334
She never knew how.

02:01:53.201 --> 02:01:55.431
Yeah, but you're
not alone now.

02:01:55.433 --> 02:01:57.732
- Yeah, you are never alone.
- Okay.

02:01:57.734 --> 02:02:00.398
- <i>Maybe their ninth...</i>
- Yeah, okay.

02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:02.334
<i>So, you know what she does?</i>

02:02:04.001 --> 02:02:06.099
<i>She looks me in the eye</i>

02:02:06.101 --> 02:02:07.932
<i>and says "Who the fuck are you</i>

02:02:07.934 --> 02:02:09.932
<i>"to want to work
with a star like me?"</i>

02:02:11.234 --> 02:02:12.867
<i>We have
been together ever since,</i>

02:02:14.167 --> 02:02:15.834
<i>through the ups and the downs,</i>

02:02:17.533 --> 02:02:20.268
<i>a... friendly lawsuit or two.</i>

02:02:21.634 --> 02:02:22.767
<i>But mostly...</i>

02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:25.665
<i>Mostly it's the good times</i>

02:02:25.667 --> 02:02:26.767
<i>that I think about.</i>

02:02:28.433 --> 02:02:31.065
<i>Both of them.</i>

02:02:31.067 --> 02:02:33.932
<i>No, seriously, I love and respect
the hell out of these women.</i>

02:02:33.934 --> 02:02:35.865
<i>And I'm proud
to call them family.</i>

02:02:35.867 --> 02:02:38.732
<i>So please,
give a paragon welcome</i>

02:02:38.734 --> 02:02:43.165
<i>for the first time together
in nearly four years,</i>

02:02:43.167 --> 02:02:45.065
<i>Becky Something,</i>

02:02:45.067 --> 02:02:46.565
<i>Ali van der Wolff,
Marielle Hell.</i>

02:02:46.567 --> 02:02:49.266
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
Something She!</i>

02:02:54.167 --> 02:02:56.201
<i>Something She!</i>

02:02:57.067 --> 02:02:58.665
Is it today?

02:02:58.667 --> 02:02:59.999
Is today the day
I don't make it?

02:03:00.001 --> 02:03:02.431
No, today's not the day.

02:03:02.433 --> 02:03:03.901
- What do you think?
- <i>Get ready for the band!</i>

02:03:09.767 --> 02:03:11.865
<i>Come on out, ladies.</i>

02:03:14.034 --> 02:03:15.167
<i>Come on.</i>

02:03:15.734 --> 02:03:16.734
<i>There they are.</i>

02:03:54.433 --> 02:03:55.732
<i>Where you been?</i>

02:03:58.101 --> 02:04:01.065
<i>Thanks for
the bullshit speech, Howard.</i>

02:04:01.067 --> 02:04:03.067
<i>I don't remember it happening
like that at all.</i>

02:04:03.734 --> 02:04:05.268
Do you remember it at all?

02:04:06.368 --> 02:04:08.034
<i>I do remember the blue hair.</i>

02:04:10.034 --> 02:04:13.732
<i>Uh, wow. What to say,
what to say, what to say!</i>

02:04:13.734 --> 02:04:17.099
<i>Uh, I know this is
all about Howard,</i>

02:04:17.101 --> 02:04:19.101
<i>uh, but I've heard
enough kind words about him,</i>

02:04:20.001 --> 02:04:21.299
<i>you know, to last a lifetime.</i>

02:04:21.301 --> 02:04:23.266
<i>Those are ones
he just says himself.</i>

02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:29.001
<i>What else is there, what else?</i>

02:04:32.101 --> 02:04:34.001
<i>Gosh, it took me a lifetime...</i>

02:04:36.934 --> 02:04:39.234
<i>It took me a lifetime
to realize that, uh...</i>

02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:44.266
<i>That, uh, without people
like these women up here</i>

02:04:44.268 --> 02:04:45.932
<i>beside me, nobody's nothin'.</i>

02:04:51.834 --> 02:04:56.999
<i>And, um, I know that you've heard
