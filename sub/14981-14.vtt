00:18.842 --> 00:20.120
Wake up, sweetheart.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.733
What?
Jakey? Jakey?

00:21.800 --> 00:23.479
Jakey, get up.
Dad, you're hurting me.

00:23.547 --> 00:26.369
Shh. Shh. Get under the bed.

00:26.937 --> 00:28.576
There's somebody
out there, jakey,

00:28.644 --> 00:30.521
So get under the bed.

00:30.589 --> 00:32.098
Daddy...
Shh.

00:33.071 --> 00:36.453
Dad!
It's just the rain!

00:39.737 --> 00:40.674
Daddy!

00:40.742 --> 00:43.587
Do not move! Copy?

01:09.066 --> 01:10.636
Aah!

01:14.653 --> 01:16.294
Jake!

01:18.769 --> 01:20.308
I told you not to move!
You ok?

01:20.376 --> 01:21.879
You all right?

01:21.947 --> 01:24.222
I'm ok, mom.
I'm ok.

01:24.290 --> 01:27.063
Damn it, Jeff!

01:27.133 --> 01:29.003
You need help!

01:29.071 --> 01:30.342
I--I told him not to--

01:32.249 --> 01:35.358
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:35.425 --> 01:36.961
Ok. Ok. Ok.

01:41.009 --> 01:42.612
Well, I think
somebody should say it.

01:42.679 --> 01:44.618
It sounds a lot like PTSD.

01:44.686 --> 01:47.459
Sergeant Turley got back
from Iraq 6 months ago.

01:47.526 --> 01:49.834
He was one of
my most effective NCOs.

01:49.902 --> 01:52.777
I read your bio,
Dr. Lightman.

01:52.845 --> 01:55.954
And I'm begging you,
do whatever it takes.

01:56.021 --> 01:57.793
All right.

01:57.861 --> 01:59.630
Are you going to help my dad?

01:59.700 --> 02:01.136
Who are you?

02:01.204 --> 02:02.875
Jake.

02:03.946 --> 02:05.048
Mum?

02:05.116 --> 02:06.921
Becky.
How do you do?

02:06.989 --> 02:07.991
Jillian.

02:08.059 --> 02:09.763
Are you a soldier?

02:09.830 --> 02:11.234
My dad was.

02:11.301 --> 02:13.573
My dad's getting a silver star.

02:13.641 --> 02:15.411
Your dad must be really brave.

02:15.479 --> 02:20.592
We're just going to sit over there.
Come on.

02:23.535 --> 02:24.973
Restraints?

02:25.040 --> 02:26.409
Turley nearly took out
his own kid

02:26.477 --> 02:29.017
With a weapon he's no
longer authorized to have.

02:29.085 --> 02:31.657
We're lucky he's not
in a cell downtown.

02:33.866 --> 02:36.103
I'll be right back.

02:43.623 --> 02:44.894
All right, Jeff.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.635
I'm Cal Lightman.

02:48.703 --> 02:50.306
Only joking.

02:50.374 --> 02:52.645
So, uh,

02:52.712 --> 02:55.051
What you so scared of, then?

02:56.488 --> 02:57.958
Say again?

02:58.026 --> 02:59.863
You heard.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.936
You have any idea what it's
like to get back from Iraq,

03:03.004 --> 03:05.108
And somebody's still
trying to kill you?

03:05.175 --> 03:07.479
No.

03:08.548 --> 03:09.780
I can only imagine.

03:09.848 --> 03:11.782
A bit basket case, if I were you.
No offense.

03:11.849 --> 03:14.117
Colonel said he'd call you in,

03:14.184 --> 03:16.719
Says you can see if I'm lying.

03:19.254 --> 03:21.821
Well?

03:26.024 --> 03:27.692
What are you doing?

03:29.461 --> 03:30.859
I'm getting you out of here.

04:03.782 --> 04:07.050
Sergeant turley saved the
lives of 14 soldiers in Iraq.

04:07.118 --> 04:10.386
Including a wounded man
he carried to safety.

04:10.454 --> 04:12.621
Army medical files make
no mention of PTSD.

04:12.689 --> 04:14.222
No, they haven't run all
the tests on him yet.

04:14.290 --> 04:15.790
The hospital has been
overwhelmed

04:15.858 --> 04:17.791
It's a 6-month wait,
minimum.

04:17.860 --> 04:21.028
Do you really think somebody's
trying to kill him?

04:21.095 --> 04:23.730
The point is, he believes it.

04:25.565 --> 04:26.865
File, please.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.866
Thank you very much.
Mm-hmm.

04:28.934 --> 04:30.134
Lightman talked to the va.

04:30.202 --> 04:31.702
They're going to let
him use the magnet.

04:31.769 --> 04:33.370
Colonel Powler cut
through the red tape.

04:33.438 --> 04:35.505
The magnet?
Their FMRI machine.

04:36.573 --> 04:38.374
All right.

04:38.441 --> 04:43.211
Says here that
you killed your house

04:43.279 --> 04:45.146
With an armor-piercing
round.

04:48.116 --> 04:50.750
Who exactly is after you?

04:53.319 --> 04:54.886
I don't know.

04:54.954 --> 04:57.989
I--I wish I did.
Trust me.

04:58.056 --> 05:00.591
Ah. All right.

05:00.658 --> 05:03.761
Let's talk about
your boy, Jake.

05:09.066 --> 05:10.566
I couldn't live without him.

05:10.634 --> 05:12.801
Well, you almost blew
his bloody head off.

05:12.869 --> 05:14.235
Up yours, man.

05:15.804 --> 05:17.938
All right. Calm down.

05:20.375 --> 05:22.842
Look at me. Come on, I dare you.
Look at me.

05:22.910 --> 05:24.510
What do you see?

05:24.578 --> 05:26.679
A smartass limey bastard.

05:26.747 --> 05:29.849
No, though, I mean,
apart from that.

05:29.917 --> 05:32.285
Friend or foe?
Be honest.

05:35.923 --> 05:37.457
Sorry. Sorry.

05:37.525 --> 05:40.961
All right.
We'll take a break, then, calm down.

05:41.029 --> 05:42.296
Listen, I'm fine, ok?

05:42.364 --> 05:44.298
Take a breath.
Take a deep breath.

05:44.365 --> 05:45.799
I'm good.
I believe you.

05:54.708 --> 05:58.477
When did you last have a decent
night's sleep, Jeff, eh?

05:58.545 --> 06:01.579
One or two months ago.

06:01.647 --> 06:04.449
Army gives me pills,
but they don't do squat.

06:04.516 --> 06:05.749
What, the little white one?

06:05.817 --> 06:08.084
Listen, I know-- I know
what you're thinking.

06:08.152 --> 06:09.586
No, you don't.

06:09.654 --> 06:10.887
I don't have PTSD.

06:10.955 --> 06:12.222
Oh, excuse me,

06:12.289 --> 06:15.025
Where did you do your
post doctorate work, eh?

06:17.061 --> 06:18.161
Think about cheese.

06:18.228 --> 06:20.396
What?

06:20.463 --> 06:21.831
Think about cheese.

06:21.898 --> 06:23.399
We're going to take a few
pictures of your brain.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.400
You might as well be smiling.

06:28.468 --> 06:31.068
So, a bunch of pictures will
appear on the screen above him,

06:31.136 --> 06:34.804
And the machine will record what happens
in his brain when he looks at them.

06:36.907 --> 06:38.274
Ok.

06:38.342 --> 06:40.476
Let's get started.

06:40.544 --> 06:44.879
Uh, flash them at
1/10 of a second.

07:01.561 --> 07:03.829
Jeff, when you see
the angry face,

07:03.897 --> 07:06.496
Your amygdala, here, lights up.

07:06.564 --> 07:10.330
We would expect that.
It's primal warrior neurons firing,

07:10.397 --> 07:12.231
The fight or flight reflexes.

07:12.299 --> 07:15.534
Which is good, if you're
a soldier in combat.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.369
But if you're home with your
wife and kid, not so good.

07:19.538 --> 07:23.841
When we flashed
the neutral face...

07:23.908 --> 07:25.975
This area should light up.

07:26.043 --> 07:27.544
But there's no change.

07:27.611 --> 07:31.718
Right. So at the neuron level,
where our emotions begin,

07:31.788 --> 07:34.959
You see this face as angry.

07:35.026 --> 07:38.228
So you're reading
neutral faces as hostile.

07:38.296 --> 07:39.429
Everyone is your enemy.

07:39.497 --> 07:42.265
That's PTSD.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.634
So you've seen a lot of combat,

07:44.701 --> 07:47.236
And you're having trouble
moving on.

07:47.304 --> 07:49.671
I've med on.
It's ok, babe.

07:49.739 --> 07:51.573
We're getting you the
help that you need.

07:53.141 --> 07:55.476
And that's avoidance.

07:55.543 --> 07:58.211
You won't let people
get close to you,

07:58.279 --> 08:01.580
Even your wife,
who we know you love.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.382
Having PTSD doesn't mean

08:04.450 --> 08:06.117
Someone out there
doesn't want me dead.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.552
Absolutely.

08:07.619 --> 08:09.687
And no one said they did.

08:09.754 --> 08:10.954
So?

08:11.022 --> 08:13.757
You're getting awarded
the silver star, right?

08:13.824 --> 08:15.158
What for?

08:18.462 --> 08:21.263
See, I would have thought you'd
be proud to tell me that.

08:23.132 --> 08:24.365
I don't want to talk about it.

08:24.433 --> 08:27.535
You seem more ashamed
than you are proud.

08:27.602 --> 08:29.503
I told you--
yeah, I know.

08:29.571 --> 08:30.837
You don't want
to talk about it,

08:30.905 --> 08:33.873
Which is why
we're going to go back.

08:33.941 --> 08:35.006
Back where?

08:35.075 --> 08:39.211
Back to the root
of the problem.

08:40.929 --> 08:42.830
Why are we doing this?
He isn't being deceptive.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.998
But he is being lied to.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.833
Yeah, by his own brain.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.835
During moments
of extreme trauma,

08:48.903 --> 08:51.470
Part of the brain
can just shut down.

08:51.538 --> 08:55.374
And in Jeff's case, the only real
memories he has of the events is--

08:55.441 --> 08:58.209
In the form of nightmares
or flashbacks.

08:58.277 --> 09:02.379
So the idea is to retraumatize
him in a controlled way.

09:02.447 --> 09:05.882
Right, so that
his memories reintegrate.

09:05.950 --> 09:09.118
The truth is the only way
to help him recover.

09:10.754 --> 09:12.788
So this is
foster's pet project, huh?

09:12.855 --> 09:14.656
Virtual reality.

09:14.724 --> 09:17.492
Yep. Foster got a dod grant
to build this prototype.

09:17.560 --> 09:21.495
You know, they say truth is
the first casualty of war.

09:21.563 --> 09:23.764
Foster thinks virtual
reality can change that.

09:31.705 --> 09:34.006
All right. The day that you
earned your silver star,

09:34.074 --> 09:36.808
Where were you?

09:36.876 --> 09:39.311
Uhh...

09:39.378 --> 09:42.847
In my humvee outside Zirmaya.

09:42.915 --> 09:46.417
Put the old, um, things down.

09:46.485 --> 09:48.619
That's it.

09:51.655 --> 09:53.756
Look at that.

09:53.823 --> 09:56.425
Same crap hole I just left.

09:56.492 --> 09:59.927
Look to your right.
What do you see?

10:01.062 --> 10:04.097
Um, Ronnie's sitting
next to me.

10:04.165 --> 10:05.332
Ronnie?

10:05.400 --> 10:07.567
Sergeant Bacca.

10:09.069 --> 10:11.337
He's what?
Your army buddy, is he?

10:11.405 --> 10:14.973
We were in
the sandbox together.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.474
He always had my back.

10:16.542 --> 10:20.044
All right. Now,
use the remote control,

10:20.111 --> 10:23.513
Yeah, to move about.
It's like a video game, really.

10:27.018 --> 10:28.518
We were number 2 in the convoy.

10:31.054 --> 10:33.021
Yeah. We were heading
into Zirmaya.

10:33.089 --> 10:34.856
Anything important?

10:34.924 --> 10:38.158
Uh, topcover.
2 helos above us.

10:38.226 --> 10:39.726
Kiowa oh-58s.

10:42.028 --> 10:43.329
And an a-10 warthog
in support.

10:43.396 --> 10:46.397
I'll see your kiowas,

10:46.465 --> 10:49.733
And I will raise you
one warthog.

10:52.170 --> 10:54.304
We're going to turn
right down this alley.

10:54.371 --> 10:58.307
It's a routine patrol, but the
road was blocked right down here.

10:58.374 --> 10:59.441
Yeah. Yeah.

10:59.509 --> 11:01.543
This lead humvee's going
to get hit by an IED.

11:08.583 --> 11:10.451
Survivors?

11:13.888 --> 11:17.390
Sutton, Cortez, and Tanaka,
all dead, just like that.

11:20.060 --> 11:22.661
Never even went
to their funerals.

11:22.728 --> 11:24.696
Some hero.

11:24.763 --> 11:26.330
Survivor's guilt.

11:28.767 --> 11:30.267
Blood pressure and heart
rate are elevated.

11:30.335 --> 11:32.769
Want some water?
No, no.

11:32.837 --> 11:33.937
No.
Let's just do this.

11:34.005 --> 11:35.605
Ok.

11:35.673 --> 11:38.908
So we're going
to take some incoming.

11:40.544 --> 11:41.911
Yeah. Incoming right here.
Where?

11:41.978 --> 11:44.246
RPG, 11 o'clock!

11:44.314 --> 11:46.982
All right. They set
my engine block on fire,

11:47.049 --> 11:48.815
And Jeffers is up on top,

11:48.882 --> 11:50.583
And we're taking
major, major heat.

11:50.651 --> 11:53.051
All right. We're going to lose
Jeffers in a second here.

11:53.119 --> 11:55.820
Uh, God.
We're taking major fire.

11:55.888 --> 11:59.089
Jeffers goes down. Jeffers is down.
Jeffers is down.

12:00.191 --> 12:01.691
He's pounding on my window.
He's yelling.

12:01.758 --> 12:03.359
He's going to haul my ass
out of here.

12:03.426 --> 12:04.993
Who is?
Uh...

12:07.863 --> 12:10.365
Ok. We're taking major fire.
He's yelling at me.

12:10.433 --> 12:13.400
He's telling me that we
got to take this compound

12:13.468 --> 12:15.135
With this red door.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.970
If I don't go through it,
he's going to kill me.

12:17.038 --> 12:18.572
Who's going to kill you?

12:19.873 --> 12:20.839
Who's going to kill you?

12:20.907 --> 12:22.774
Who's going to kill you?

12:27.813 --> 12:29.813
Who's going to kill you?

12:31.482 --> 12:32.916
What, you're a coward now, are you?

12:32.983 --> 12:34.083
Are you scared?

12:34.151 --> 12:36.719
You calling me a coward,
captain?

12:36.787 --> 12:40.289
Who you calling
a captain, sergeant?

12:46.229 --> 12:50.198
All right.
Foster? Torres?

12:50.266 --> 12:52.233
Find this man's captain.

12:54.236 --> 12:57.037
Private Johns got shot
with a 7.62 round.

12:57.105 --> 12:59.339
First thing he's going to be
doing is screaming for his mama.

12:59.407 --> 13:04.009
Now, you reach into his pack
to find the pressure bandage.

13:04.077 --> 13:07.342
Instead, you find tobacco.

13:07.410 --> 13:12.011
Pressure bandage.
Upper right-hand pouch as you wear it.

13:12.078 --> 13:16.014
With a large wound, you can use
the plastic to contain any mess.

13:21.620 --> 13:23.287
At ease, gentlemen.

13:26.357 --> 13:27.957
Afternoon, ladies.
Hi.

13:28.025 --> 13:29.458
You work
with Dr. Lightman?

13:29.526 --> 13:31.159
Yes. I'm Jillian foster.
Torres.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.495
Colonel Powler said I
could be of help to you.

13:33.562 --> 13:36.230
You served
with sergeant Jeff turley?

13:36.298 --> 13:39.566
Sorry to hear he's having
some trouble readjusting.

13:39.634 --> 13:40.900
Glad he's working with you.

13:40.968 --> 13:44.303
We used to study Dr.
Lightman's work at West point.

13:44.370 --> 13:45.871
Really?
At West point?

13:45.938 --> 13:48.139
Every officer reads
Dr. Lightman's book.

13:48.207 --> 13:50.308
In Iraq, we used his
facereading techniques

13:50.375 --> 13:52.242
To help identify insurgents.

13:52.310 --> 13:55.011
I can't tell you how many
soldiers he helped save.

14:26.205 --> 14:27.639
What are you doing here?

14:27.707 --> 14:30.908
Nothing. I, uh,
I got you a cactus.

14:30.976 --> 14:32.243
Why?

14:32.310 --> 14:34.278
Why not?

14:36.681 --> 14:37.981
What have you done?

14:38.049 --> 14:40.716
I haven't done anything.
I just--

14:40.784 --> 14:43.085
It--it reminded me
of you.

14:47.323 --> 14:48.923
So can you tell us what
happened at Zirmaya,

14:48.991 --> 14:50.925
After the convoy was hit?

14:50.993 --> 14:53.160
Turley froze, terrified.

14:53.228 --> 14:55.496
We were in a kill zone.
His gunner was k.I.A.

14:55.563 --> 14:56.963
I had to get him
out of that humvee.

14:57.031 --> 14:58.898
Otherwise, he'd be dead, too.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.667
Why would he say
you want to kill him?

15:01.735 --> 15:03.702
Because at that instant,
I did want to kill him.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.737
And I wasn't the only one.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.339
I had to yank him
out of that humvee.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.541
30 seconds later, it blew up.

15:09.608 --> 15:11.676
Yet you recommended him
for the silver star.

15:11.743 --> 15:14.178
Bravery is overcoming
your fear.

15:14.245 --> 15:16.713
Turley did that.

15:16.781 --> 15:20.149
He stepped up, saved lives
without regard for his own.

15:23.086 --> 15:26.622
Sir, battalion update briefing
is moved from 1800 to 1630.

15:26.688 --> 15:28.786
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

15:28.854 --> 15:30.188
We're deploying in 3 days.

15:30.255 --> 15:33.057
Let me get you the afteraction
report from Zirmaya.

15:33.124 --> 15:35.459
Taw will be back with it
in 2 minutes.

15:37.928 --> 15:39.795
Ladies.

15:41.598 --> 15:43.599
Well, if you want my read,
he's telling the truth.

15:43.667 --> 15:45.300
That's the kind of guy
I'd follow into war.

15:45.368 --> 15:48.638
That's because he was flirting
with you the entire time.

15:48.706 --> 15:50.840
Well, it gave me a baseline.

15:50.908 --> 15:55.244
This is a guy who's deploying
back to the war in 3 days.

15:55.312 --> 15:57.213
His voice, the pride in it?

15:57.281 --> 15:59.282
He's hiding something.

16:08.032 --> 16:09.666
Oh, neat car.

16:09.733 --> 16:10.800
My dad gave it to me.

16:10.868 --> 16:12.301
Jake, Emily.
Emily, Jake.

16:12.368 --> 16:14.035
Is he your dad?
Yeah.

16:14.103 --> 16:16.037
He's helping my dad.
My dad's a soldier.

16:16.105 --> 16:18.372
Ahh.
You can talk about that later.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.840
Go. Go on.
Bye, Jake.

16:19.907 --> 16:21.041
Off you go. Go on.
Keep going.

16:21.108 --> 16:23.409
Nice to meet you.
Keep going.

16:23.477 --> 16:26.711
Keep going. Keep going.
That's it. Go on.

16:34.984 --> 16:37.151
Based on
the afteraction report,

16:37.219 --> 16:38.985
Here is the official story.

16:39.053 --> 16:41.420
Right. So, humvee gets
blown up here, right?

16:41.488 --> 16:44.689
Now, they're taking fire
from here and here.

16:44.757 --> 16:46.857
Jeff, Ronnie, and the captain,

16:46.925 --> 16:48.391
They assault the red door.

16:48.459 --> 16:49.859
Right. Jeff goes through
the red door first.

16:49.927 --> 16:52.527
Yes. And he clears the
snipers nests here and here,

16:52.595 --> 16:57.231
And he shoots
a combatant here, ok?

16:57.298 --> 17:00.799
And a firefight happens here.

17:00.867 --> 17:02.600
And that's
the official version.

17:02.668 --> 17:04.169
What do you think, there's
more than one version?

17:04.237 --> 17:06.771
There's always
more than one version.

17:22.492 --> 17:23.762
Can I have a go?

17:23.829 --> 17:26.469
Sure.

17:37.546 --> 17:39.213
I think I broke it.

17:40.816 --> 17:43.216
It's an accident.
It's all right.

17:43.284 --> 17:45.685
It does that sometimes.

17:48.555 --> 17:50.155
When you asked me
if I was a soldier,

17:50.223 --> 17:52.157
Were you hoping that I
was going to be one?

17:52.225 --> 17:53.925
Yeah, like my dad.

17:53.992 --> 17:56.160
Oh. Well, I'm not.

17:56.228 --> 17:57.894
Oh.

18:01.464 --> 18:03.164
Come here.

18:03.232 --> 18:04.866
I--

18:09.172 --> 18:10.673
How'd you get that, then?

18:10.741 --> 18:12.808
My dad gets scared.

18:14.344 --> 18:17.112
What, like,
when he fired his gun?

18:17.180 --> 18:19.414
That was an accident, too.

18:19.482 --> 18:20.981
Ok.

18:22.847 --> 18:23.877
Are you scared of your dad?

18:23.945 --> 18:25.544
How do you know?

18:25.612 --> 18:28.380
Well, I was a boy once,
you know.

18:28.448 --> 18:31.383
Only I was about, um...

18:31.451 --> 18:33.351
Well, I was much shorter.

18:33.419 --> 18:35.853
My dad was trying
to protect me.

18:35.921 --> 18:37.054
From what?

18:37.122 --> 18:40.357
The bruises.
They're from Ronnie.

18:42.093 --> 18:43.760
Your dad's army buddy?

18:43.827 --> 18:46.996
He lives above our garage now.

18:48.998 --> 18:51.499
Hey, Jake...

18:51.567 --> 18:53.934
When you say that Ronnie hurts
you, that's a big deal.

18:54.002 --> 18:56.836
You know that, right?
Hmm?

19:00.305 --> 19:02.907
I saw Ronnie and my mom
once in the kitchen.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.077
Mm-hmm.

19:04.145 --> 19:07.682
He touched her face like this.

19:11.319 --> 19:13.753
Jake is afraid
of losing his dad.

19:13.821 --> 19:16.456
He blames Ronnie.
That's why he's telling lies.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.791
A boy sees his father
falling apart,

19:18.858 --> 19:20.459
And then, another soldier
moves into the house

19:20.526 --> 19:23.961
And provides support and
comfort to his mother.

19:24.029 --> 19:26.129
Put yourself in his shoes.

19:26.197 --> 19:29.234
Is there something going
on between you and Ronnie?

19:29.302 --> 19:31.402
Ronnie's very special to us.

19:31.470 --> 19:32.870
We're very lucky
to have him around,

19:32.938 --> 19:34.505
Particularly with
what's going on.

19:34.573 --> 19:37.508
Yeah. You said no, but what
you were actually doing

19:37.576 --> 19:38.809
Was nodding yes.

19:38.877 --> 19:43.546
She never actually said no.
Did you, Becky?

19:45.850 --> 19:48.151
And right there, you just
sucked in your cheek,

19:48.219 --> 19:50.154
Which means you were
trying to wipe away

19:50.222 --> 19:51.588
An obvious emotion.

19:51.656 --> 19:55.524
Ronnie's the only friend
we have.

19:55.592 --> 19:57.493
Jeff never came back
from the war.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.995
He grabs his knife,
and he vanishes at night,

20:00.063 --> 20:01.931
And the only person
I can call is Ronnie.

20:01.998 --> 20:05.700
So there's nothing more
than that between you two?

20:08.336 --> 20:10.904
No. There's not.

20:11.940 --> 20:13.207
Not yet.

20:14.709 --> 20:17.110
Problem. Jeff's gone.

20:18.045 --> 20:20.446
Go to my house
and see Ronnie...

20:20.514 --> 20:23.316
Like I have to all the time.

20:29.089 --> 20:30.489
You going somewhere, Ronnie?

20:30.557 --> 20:33.326
One-eyed night at the ice rink.
Who's asking?

20:33.393 --> 20:35.661
I'm Dr. Foster.
This is Dr. Lightman.

20:35.729 --> 20:37.663
We're looking for
your friend Jeff.

20:38.932 --> 20:40.700
You look a little nervous.

20:40.767 --> 20:41.967
Mind you, I would be, too,

20:42.035 --> 20:43.869
If I was bashing
another man's son around.

20:44.938 --> 20:47.239
Jake says you hit him.

20:47.307 --> 20:50.409
He's a kid.
It's been a rough 6 months.

20:50.477 --> 20:52.645
I would never touch him.

20:52.712 --> 20:55.714
Are you sleeping with
your friend's wife?

20:57.083 --> 20:58.517
I'll take that as
a "not yet."

20:58.585 --> 21:02.121
Mind you, I've seen her.
I mean, you know, she is tasty.

21:02.188 --> 21:03.956
I feel your pain.

21:04.024 --> 21:06.058
The man saved my life.

21:06.126 --> 21:07.959
I'm not going near his wife.

21:08.027 --> 21:09.494
End of story.

21:09.562 --> 21:11.663
All right.
I'll buy that.

21:11.731 --> 21:14.665
I got his back, all right?
It's all good.

21:14.733 --> 21:18.369
Hot date at the ice rink,
Ronnie?

21:21.973 --> 21:24.941
Jeff was here.
I'm going to go find him.

21:25.009 --> 21:27.277
All right.
All right.

21:27.345 --> 21:29.943
Becky says
he goes walkabout at night.

21:30.010 --> 21:33.478
To the veterans cemetery.
See some friends.

21:34.714 --> 21:37.148
5 months ago,

21:37.216 --> 21:38.983
In Iraq,

21:39.051 --> 21:42.486
You busted through a red
door with your squad.

21:42.554 --> 21:43.954
What happened
at the other side?

21:44.022 --> 21:45.890
Well, I took the hit
pretty quick.

21:45.957 --> 21:49.292
You're going to have to
ask Jeff, or the captain.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.494
You don't like the
captain much, do you?

21:51.561 --> 21:53.095
He's a good officer.

21:53.163 --> 21:54.696
What about Jeff?

21:54.764 --> 21:56.498
How does he feel
about the captain?

21:58.067 --> 22:00.701
Not much?

22:02.170 --> 22:04.237
What else are you
hiding from us?

22:05.773 --> 22:08.207
My gun's missing.

22:10.275 --> 22:12.776
You don't take a gun
to a cemetery, do you?

22:19.847 --> 22:23.357
Hey.
Captain Renshaw.

22:23.424 --> 22:25.625
Dr. Lightman.
Dr. Foster.

22:25.693 --> 22:28.794
Your man Turley's on
the loose with a gun.

22:28.862 --> 22:30.562
Really?
Oh, yeah.

22:30.630 --> 22:31.963
We thought
he might come see you.

22:32.030 --> 22:33.330
Why?
Well, that was going to be

22:33.398 --> 22:34.698
Our next question

22:34.766 --> 22:37.232
well, he's not here.

22:37.300 --> 22:38.700
Oh.

22:38.768 --> 22:40.202
Can we do this in the morning?

22:40.269 --> 22:41.869
I actually need to get
as much sleep as I can

22:41.937 --> 22:43.070
Before we ship out.

22:43.138 --> 22:45.372
Yeah. I'm sorry
we bothered you.

22:45.439 --> 22:47.307
We thought we would
just let you know.

22:48.876 --> 22:50.176
I appreciate that.

22:50.243 --> 22:51.510
You should get your head down,

22:51.578 --> 22:53.078
Get some sleep.

22:53.146 --> 22:54.479
I will do my best.

22:54.546 --> 22:55.646
All right.
Good night.

22:55.714 --> 22:58.047
Good night.

22:58.115 --> 22:59.981
Well, he's in there.

23:40.579 --> 23:42.282
That doesn't look like a
man reaching for a drink.

23:42.751 --> 23:44.854
That looks like a man who
knows how to fight dirty.

23:44.921 --> 23:46.789
Well, it takes one to know one.

23:46.857 --> 23:49.124
I'm going to go stall
him at the front door.

23:49.192 --> 23:51.993
Well, that's a good idea.

24:09.543 --> 24:12.710
Hi. Captain Renshaw.
Just one more thing.

24:14.546 --> 24:16.046
Dr. Foster,
I did tell you that

24:16.114 --> 24:17.480
We're shipping out tomorrow.

24:17.548 --> 24:19.148
I was planning on going to bed.

24:19.216 --> 24:21.484
What is so important that
you need to talk to me

24:21.551 --> 24:22.818
In the middle of the night?

24:22.886 --> 24:25.321
Look, we think that
Jeff is under the impression

24:25.389 --> 24:29.991
That he has unfinished business
with you about the war.

24:30.059 --> 24:33.061
I nominated him
for a silver star.

24:33.129 --> 24:35.796
Getting it pinned on him is
our only unfinished business.

24:35.864 --> 24:39.197
We know that
he is an honorable man.

24:39.265 --> 24:41.297
He's a hero.

24:41.365 --> 24:43.298
And we also know that
those are words

24:43.365 --> 24:45.898
That he would never use
to describe himself.

24:45.966 --> 24:48.066
Sounds like
sergeant turley to me.

24:50.269 --> 24:51.870
Can I come in?

24:55.073 --> 24:57.908
Put the gun down, Jeff.

24:57.976 --> 24:59.810
Lightman,

24:59.878 --> 25:01.480
You are way out of your depth.

25:01.548 --> 25:04.218
Absolutely.
I'm coming in from your left,

25:04.285 --> 25:05.352
And I am armed, all right?

25:05.420 --> 25:06.920
Here I come.

25:06.988 --> 25:09.155
Right, see?
There it is.

25:12.692 --> 25:14.592
Why do this?

25:14.660 --> 25:16.527
Why do this?

25:16.595 --> 25:18.129
Ask him.

25:18.197 --> 25:20.965
He knows.
Don't you?

25:21.032 --> 25:23.768
Why don't you enlighten me, sergeant?

25:24.803 --> 25:26.403
Did you come here
to kill the captain,

25:26.471 --> 25:29.673
Or just talk about
killing him, eh?

25:33.845 --> 25:35.446
Give him the gun.

25:35.513 --> 25:36.613
Nope.

25:36.681 --> 25:37.915
Come on.
Give it to him.

25:37.983 --> 25:39.550
No.
Give it to him!

25:39.617 --> 25:42.886
He wants to kill me,

25:42.954 --> 25:44.554
He can go ahead
and do it himself.

25:44.621 --> 25:47.422
You want to kill me, hmm?

25:48.457 --> 25:49.557
Do it.

25:49.625 --> 25:51.958
You need help, sergeant.

25:52.026 --> 25:54.427
Why does the captain
want to kill you?

25:56.630 --> 25:59.832
Because you deserve it?

25:59.900 --> 26:01.301
Or think you do?

26:01.368 --> 26:03.903
You're trying to kill
yourself here, aren't you?

26:05.406 --> 26:06.506
Well, it's a bit different

26:06.573 --> 26:07.940
With the gun in my hand,
isn't it?

26:13.016 --> 26:14.350
I let everybody down.

26:14.417 --> 26:17.085
You didn't do any such thing.

26:17.153 --> 26:18.586
When you got shot up
in that humvee,

26:18.654 --> 26:20.955
It was on fire.
You were afraid.

26:22.458 --> 26:25.861
But in my book, bravery is what
you do in spite of fear, son.

26:29.999 --> 26:32.934
You know what?
Sod this, all right?

26:33.002 --> 26:34.669
I mean, really.

26:36.371 --> 26:38.205
What happened behind
the red door?

26:39.808 --> 26:41.908
What happens over there
stays over there.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.511
Really? Well,
not for him, clearly.

26:44.578 --> 26:47.246
It doesn't do him or anyone else
any good to keep going over it.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.582
Anyone else?

26:49.649 --> 26:52.118
You got someone particular
in mind, have you?

26:52.185 --> 26:54.686
Look at him.

26:54.754 --> 26:56.422
You think this is helping?

26:58.058 --> 27:00.226
Jeff? Enough.

27:00.294 --> 27:02.260
He doesn't have a gun.

27:02.328 --> 27:05.097
And even if I did, I
don't want to kill you.

27:06.366 --> 27:08.567
Put the gun down.

27:17.502 --> 27:19.334
Here I come.

27:23.571 --> 27:25.071
Here.

27:41.883 --> 27:44.948
So you're outside
the humvee, right?

27:47.517 --> 27:48.916
Now what?

27:51.286 --> 27:54.119
Uh, I'm ok. Ronnie, me and the
captain were the assault team.

27:54.187 --> 27:55.887
The rest of the convoy
is pinned down.

27:58.957 --> 27:59.956
Look, let's skip ahead

28:00.024 --> 28:01.758
To the bit with the red door.

28:01.825 --> 28:03.192
The insurgents are in there.

28:03.260 --> 28:05.027
All right, so, you go
through the red door,

28:05.094 --> 28:06.094
You're going to save
the convoy, right?

28:06.162 --> 28:07.629
Uh-huh.
So...

28:08.798 --> 28:10.399
Kick it in.

28:13.503 --> 28:15.370
Kick it in.

28:15.437 --> 28:17.071
Come on, Jeff.

28:22.309 --> 28:23.643
Come on, kick it in.
Go on, I dare you.

28:23.710 --> 28:25.911
Kick it in, kick it in.

28:27.580 --> 28:28.714
No, no.

28:28.782 --> 28:30.082
I can't.
I can't go in there.

28:30.150 --> 28:32.684
Look, it's just a bloody
video game, Jeff.

28:32.752 --> 28:34.252
It's safe as anything.
I can't, ok?

28:34.320 --> 28:35.353
Why not, Jeff?

28:35.421 --> 28:37.189
My son is in there!

28:44.635 --> 28:46.136
Right.

28:46.204 --> 28:50.373
Your son is 9 years old, Jeff,

28:50.441 --> 28:53.109
Right? Right?

28:53.177 --> 28:55.411
So he's not in this war.

28:55.479 --> 28:58.682
No. No, he's not.

28:58.750 --> 29:00.717
Oh.

29:00.785 --> 29:02.853
So kick the door down.

29:06.157 --> 29:08.458
Kick the door down.

29:10.362 --> 29:12.496
I can't.
Ok.

29:12.564 --> 29:16.166
Well, then your story
is a load of bullocks.

29:16.234 --> 29:18.134
Look, you're running
out of options.

29:18.202 --> 29:19.469
You either kick the door down

29:19.537 --> 29:22.238
Or you're raising your
kid from the looney bin!

29:27.014 --> 29:28.782
Right, in you come.

29:29.849 --> 29:32.617
Faster, come on.

29:32.684 --> 29:34.418
Ok!

29:34.486 --> 29:36.219
Ronnie banks left,
takes out a sniper.

29:36.287 --> 29:38.587
Aah!

29:38.655 --> 29:39.988
I went right,
captain goes high.

29:40.056 --> 29:41.222
There was a car there, I
took some cover behind it.

29:41.290 --> 29:42.456
All right, you're afraid.

29:42.524 --> 29:44.658
That's good, 'cause
that means you're there.

29:44.725 --> 29:46.126
React to contact.
It's what we train for.

29:46.193 --> 29:48.128
Now you were taking
sniper fire, right?

29:48.195 --> 29:49.897
I return fire
with my m-4,

29:49.964 --> 29:51.932
Pop off a 40 millimeter
grenade round.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.336
Ahh!

29:57.707 --> 29:58.940
Carry on.

29:59.008 --> 30:01.009
Ok, so we move forward
through the market,

30:01.077 --> 30:03.111
I'm on point.

30:08.649 --> 30:12.050
I take a turn,
and there was, uh...

30:12.117 --> 30:14.918
There was resistance.

30:14.985 --> 30:16.118
Resistance?

30:16.185 --> 30:19.322
I saw a combatant.

30:19.390 --> 30:20.991
Unh!

30:22.193 --> 30:24.629
There's a combatant?

30:24.697 --> 30:26.934
A combatant? He's not
an enemy this time.

30:27.001 --> 30:28.605
No, he's making a distinction.

30:32.913 --> 30:35.650
But he came out of nowhere!
He came out of the archway.

30:35.718 --> 30:38.119
It's a kid.

30:38.187 --> 30:40.521
I was looking right down
the barrel of his gun.

30:40.589 --> 30:42.522
Up like that?

30:47.060 --> 30:49.429
He was 10 years old.

30:49.497 --> 30:52.332
That's about the same
age as your son, eh?

30:52.399 --> 30:54.467
Yeah.

30:54.534 --> 30:56.802
What'd you do?

30:56.870 --> 30:59.637
Did you kill him?

31:01.807 --> 31:03.240
Ahh!

31:13.484 --> 31:17.086
They train you for everything,
they don't train you for that.

31:21.625 --> 31:24.061
What you just told me

31:24.128 --> 31:26.196
Was a lie.

31:26.264 --> 31:28.364
What are you talkin' about?

31:28.432 --> 31:30.433
What are you talkin' about?
I told you!

31:30.501 --> 31:31.834
We--we came through
the market,

31:31.902 --> 31:33.202
I turned left,
he came out of nowhere

31:33.270 --> 31:34.771
And I returned fire!

31:34.838 --> 31:35.971
Unh!

31:36.039 --> 31:38.438
All right, fair enough.

31:38.506 --> 31:39.972
But...

31:40.040 --> 31:43.708
Why does that make the
captain want to kill you?

31:43.776 --> 31:46.514
Huh?

31:48.117 --> 31:50.651
I don't know.

31:50.719 --> 31:52.719
I don't know.
Maybe he doesn't.

31:52.787 --> 31:56.522
Maybe I am nuts.
I'm just...

31:56.589 --> 31:58.056
I'm telling you
everything I know.

31:58.124 --> 32:01.059
Ah, no, something
definitely happened

32:01.126 --> 32:03.495
That day.

32:04.564 --> 32:07.565
Well, if you can't
tell me what it was,

32:07.633 --> 32:10.636
I'll have to get it
out of the captain.

32:16.609 --> 32:18.777
All right,
Jeff lost it in Zirmaya.

32:18.844 --> 32:21.278
And since that place
has been completely

32:21.346 --> 32:22.879
Blown off the map,

32:22.947 --> 32:25.148
This'll have to do.

32:25.215 --> 32:26.415
I thought the point of therapy

32:26.483 --> 32:27.850
Was to put the day behind him.

32:27.918 --> 32:29.018
Oh, what, you're a psychiatrist

32:29.085 --> 32:31.252
In your spare time, eh?
Neither am I.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.720
She is, however.

32:32.788 --> 32:36.023
Turley's gotten worse since
you've been in his life.

32:36.091 --> 32:37.191
I have to agree.

32:37.258 --> 32:38.792
He's completely unstable.

32:38.860 --> 32:41.528
Lightman has
that effect on people.

32:41.595 --> 32:43.963
Try being her.

32:44.965 --> 32:46.432
All right, you said

32:46.499 --> 32:48.300
You'd take a bullet for Jeff,

32:48.368 --> 32:50.001
Didn't you, captain?

32:50.069 --> 32:52.070
Anything for one of my men.

32:52.137 --> 32:53.671
All right.

32:53.739 --> 32:56.373
Well, let's put that
to the test.

33:02.513 --> 33:05.181
So you come through
the red door.

33:08.084 --> 33:09.787
All right, then what?

33:09.855 --> 33:12.490
I go to the right with Renshaw.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.191
I head left,
take out the sniper,

33:14.259 --> 33:16.460
Upper window.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.196
Ahh!

33:18.264 --> 33:21.633
Captain?
You're awfully quiet.

33:21.701 --> 33:25.536
I laid down suppressive fire
to cover the upper floor.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.338
Well, then what?

33:28.406 --> 33:30.640
I cleared through the market.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.280
One more enemy
k.I.A. At the end.

33:37.348 --> 33:40.083
Ahh!

33:40.151 --> 33:42.051
And that's when the kid
came through with the a.K.

33:44.755 --> 33:45.688
What, right here?

33:45.755 --> 33:46.955
Yeah.
Yeah?

33:47.023 --> 33:49.624
Right. Gillian.
Be the kid.

33:49.691 --> 33:51.859
Go on.

33:51.927 --> 33:54.128
Heels off,
make yourself shorter.

33:54.195 --> 33:56.863
You know, shouldn't be too difficult.

33:58.432 --> 34:00.865
Ok, so you see the kid.

34:00.933 --> 34:02.967
Then what happens, Jeff?

34:03.035 --> 34:04.902
I killed him.

34:04.969 --> 34:06.836
Ahh!

34:11.909 --> 34:13.677
You killed him?

34:13.745 --> 34:15.947
Is that before or after

34:16.014 --> 34:18.549
Ronnie becomes a cyclops?

34:20.784 --> 34:22.185
Ahh!

34:22.253 --> 34:23.753
I got shot.
I don't remember.

34:23.821 --> 34:25.286
Yeah, but you would remember

34:25.355 --> 34:27.922
If Jeff's gun went off
before you got shot, right?

34:27.991 --> 34:29.524
I heard a lot
of shots that day, ok?

34:29.592 --> 34:30.725
No, no, no, no.

34:30.793 --> 34:32.726
I froze.

34:32.795 --> 34:35.429
I froze.

34:40.969 --> 34:43.437
I didn't kill the kid.
I froze.

34:43.505 --> 34:44.737
I froze.

34:51.245 --> 34:52.745
I-I--

34:52.812 --> 34:55.280
I should have fired,
but I didn't.

35:00.519 --> 35:04.121
Is that because it was a kid?

35:07.325 --> 35:08.892
Ahh!

35:18.135 --> 35:19.268
Ronnie!

35:21.371 --> 35:23.405
All right, first, uh,

35:23.473 --> 35:26.541
Point at Ronnie.

35:27.743 --> 35:29.210
Go on.

35:30.812 --> 35:31.979
Ok.

35:32.047 --> 35:33.447
Well, say, "bang."

35:33.514 --> 35:34.948
Bang.

35:35.016 --> 35:36.449
All right, brilliant.

35:36.517 --> 35:37.817
All right, Ronnie,
on the ground.

35:39.853 --> 35:41.820
Ok.

35:41.888 --> 35:44.323
Jeff.

35:44.390 --> 35:46.091
What then?

35:46.159 --> 35:47.792
Uh...I went to him.

35:47.860 --> 35:49.327
Ronnie!

35:49.394 --> 35:51.595
I covered them.

35:55.900 --> 35:57.233
In the report,

35:57.300 --> 36:00.503
It doesn't say anything
about Jeff freezing.

36:02.038 --> 36:03.238
You wrote
the report up, captain.

36:03.306 --> 36:06.140
Why'd you leave that out?

36:09.611 --> 36:14.047
His best friend got hurt as a
direct result of his inaction.

36:14.115 --> 36:16.216
You see that, right?
Defensive posture.

36:16.283 --> 36:20.688
Yeah. Defensive of...
Yourself?

36:22.223 --> 36:23.723
I saw something.

36:23.791 --> 36:25.925
The kid?
No, no, no.

36:25.993 --> 36:28.527
The kid ran away.

36:29.629 --> 36:32.530
Right, so the kid
legs it, right?

36:32.598 --> 36:34.032
And then, uh,

36:34.100 --> 36:36.601
What? You saw
something else?

36:36.668 --> 36:38.169
Yeah.

36:38.236 --> 36:40.504
I saw someone else.

36:41.439 --> 36:43.740
You saw "someone" else?

36:45.876 --> 36:47.743
Who'd you see, Jeff?

36:49.079 --> 36:50.779
Who came through here?

37:00.489 --> 37:01.723
Ronnie!

37:06.428 --> 37:08.696
Oh, my eye!

37:14.437 --> 37:17.505
Get him up!

37:18.774 --> 37:20.408
Friendly fire.

37:20.476 --> 37:22.609
Your report was fiction,
captain.

37:22.677 --> 37:24.277
You killed one of your own men.

37:24.345 --> 37:25.946
Game over.

37:26.013 --> 37:28.415
He was from another company.

37:29.750 --> 37:32.084
Got cut off from his squad.

37:35.855 --> 37:37.255
Sorrow?

37:37.322 --> 37:39.123
Remorse?

37:39.191 --> 37:41.225
It was an accident.

37:41.292 --> 37:43.626
Your senior officer

37:43.694 --> 37:46.695
Had you lie
about friendly fire.

37:46.763 --> 37:48.697
He had to,

37:48.765 --> 37:51.867
If he was going to keep
it out of the report.

37:51.934 --> 37:53.134
Sergeant here
is an unstable man.

37:53.202 --> 37:55.002
History of mental problems.

37:55.070 --> 37:57.471
Oh, yeah, yeah,
he's absolutely crackers,

37:57.538 --> 38:00.474
But one minute later,

38:00.542 --> 38:03.077
Zirmaya gets blown off the map,

38:03.144 --> 38:05.445
Right?

38:05.513 --> 38:07.146
Who called in the air strike?

38:07.214 --> 38:09.314
Captain?

38:09.382 --> 38:11.816
I wonder.

38:11.883 --> 38:14.384
Renshaw,
he asked you a question.

38:16.187 --> 38:17.723
When I picked up
Ronnie and ran...

38:17.791 --> 38:19.258
Come here, man.
Come here.

38:19.326 --> 38:20.960
Up, up!

38:21.027 --> 38:23.428
Unh! Come on,
come on, come on!

38:23.496 --> 38:25.563
I could hear a warthog
above us.

38:25.631 --> 38:29.767
And Renshaw was calling
in an air strike.

38:29.835 --> 38:33.636
Cobra seven, this is bulldog six.
You are cleared hot!

38:46.247 --> 38:47.947
Friendly fire isn't a crime.

38:48.015 --> 38:51.150
But covering up friendly
fire with an air strike--

38:51.218 --> 38:52.284
That--

38:52.352 --> 38:54.153
That's a war crime.

38:54.220 --> 38:57.322
You know how many people
died in that air strike?

38:59.191 --> 39:01.426
You see that?

39:01.493 --> 39:02.693
That...

39:02.761 --> 39:06.296
Is what your mind
couldn't handle.

39:35.488 --> 39:37.488
All right.

39:37.556 --> 39:39.823
So this is our friendly
fire victim, eh?

39:39.891 --> 39:42.793
I wanted to honor him somehow.

39:44.428 --> 39:46.562
Well, you've done that.

39:46.630 --> 39:50.165
Saved Ronnie's life,
got a silver star.

39:50.233 --> 39:52.100
Well done, mate.

39:52.168 --> 39:54.836
Got something better
than that last night.

39:54.903 --> 39:56.137
Oh, yeah?

39:56.204 --> 39:58.572
A good night's sleep.

39:58.640 --> 40:01.808
Oh, 'cause I was thinking,
you know, the other.

40:01.876 --> 40:03.676
Mind's in the gutter.

40:07.047 --> 40:10.382
Thanks for helping my dad.

40:10.449 --> 40:13.117
No worries.

40:27.864 --> 40:30.232
Comfortable,
Dr. Lightman?

40:30.299 --> 40:31.766
Does it matter?

40:33.202 --> 40:35.603
You want me to run the
whole battery of scans?

40:35.670 --> 40:38.505
Yeah, the usual suspects.

41:02.993 --> 41:05.494
Have you finished
checking my homework?

41:05.562 --> 41:07.129
Mm-hmm.

41:07.196 --> 41:08.429
Yeah.

41:08.497 --> 41:10.697
I'm nearly done.
Yeah, look at this.

41:10.765 --> 41:13.200
You're gonna like this.

41:13.267 --> 41:15.167
Yeah. Check that out.

41:15.235 --> 41:16.634
Take a look at this.

41:16.702 --> 41:18.136
What do you see?

41:18.203 --> 41:20.471
Uh, wrinkles.

41:20.538 --> 41:22.706
Like--like one of those dogs
with the scrunched-up faces.

41:22.774 --> 41:24.141
All right.

41:24.208 --> 41:25.175
Like a shar pei.

41:25.243 --> 41:27.376
Brains are ugly.

41:27.444 --> 41:28.811
That's my brain, that is.

41:28.879 --> 41:32.847
Oh. Well, you have
a very handsome brain.

41:32.915 --> 41:34.449
Thank you very much.
Hmm.

41:34.516 --> 41:36.451
Ok, you see this area here?

41:36.519 --> 41:39.620
That is supposed to be love.

41:39.688 --> 41:42.789
Aww, when you look
at a picture of me?

41:42.857 --> 41:45.225
Mmm, yeah, aww.

41:45.292 --> 41:46.626
All right, now see
what this says.

41:47.594 --> 41:50.229
Fight or flight?

41:50.297 --> 41:51.663
A picture of mom
triggered that.

41:51.731 --> 41:52.731
Yeah, so flight, mostly.

41:52.799 --> 41:54.466
You're making that up.

41:54.534 --> 41:57.101
No, look at me, read my face.

41:57.169 --> 41:59.303
Huh? There.

41:59.371 --> 42:01.405
Ok, now foster.

42:01.473 --> 42:03.907
Whoa, fourth of July.
Oh, yeah?

42:03.975 --> 42:06.976
Shepherd's pie.
All right. Here.

42:08.545 --> 42:11.747
That's your granddad, that is.

42:11.814 --> 42:14.115
And this you?
Yep.

42:14.183 --> 42:15.350
He was a soldier.

42:15.417 --> 42:16.617
You never told me that.

42:16.685 --> 42:18.852
You never asked.

42:18.920 --> 42:21.855
He didn't talk about it much.

42:21.922 --> 42:23.656
You know,
I'm curious about him.

42:23.724 --> 42:26.192
Yeah. Me, too.

42:26.259 --> 42:27.659
But you never asked him
about the war?

42:27.727 --> 42:29.194
No, it was a matter of respect,

42:29.261 --> 42:31.196
Really, you know?

42:31.263 --> 42:33.364
I mean, he came out of the war,

42:33.432 --> 42:34.999
And he went straight
back to work

42:35.066 --> 42:36.333
In the rail yard.

42:36.401 --> 42:39.235
He put me through college,
so that was that.

42:39.302 --> 42:41.436
I'd like to meet him someday.

42:41.504 --> 42:42.670
Yeah.

42:42.738 --> 42:44.206
Well, one day, eh?

42:44.207 --> 42:49.207
