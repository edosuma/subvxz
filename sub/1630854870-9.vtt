WEBVTT

00:02.869 --> 00:04.804
Ted, travel Number One to set.

00:04.904 --> 00:07.774
Copy that, making my way over.

00:15.615 --> 00:17.150
Liability?

00:17.250 --> 00:18.685
What's that supposed to mean?

00:18.785 --> 00:20.687
Well, I know what the
definition of liability is...

00:20.787 --> 00:22.989
Mr. Larson?
They're ready for you on set.

00:23.089 --> 00:25.759
[in trailer] What about
the "Sexiest Man of the Year"?

00:25.859 --> 00:29.129
No...
No...

00:29.229 --> 00:31.698
No, that's not
how it works, Jerry.

00:31.798 --> 00:34.434
Well... well, you need to
fly your ass down there

00:34.534 --> 00:36.536
and demand that it happens!

00:36.636 --> 00:39.873
What? I don't care if
it's Eva's Sweet Sixteen, Jerry,

00:39.973 --> 00:41.241
that's not my problem!

00:41.341 --> 00:43.009
Hey, Kid.
Relax, alright?

00:43.109 --> 00:44.477
I'll get there when I get there.

00:44.577 --> 00:47.180
Well, why do I pay you
commission, then, Jerry?

00:47.280 --> 00:48.348
Huh?

00:48.448 --> 00:49.916
Well, it's not because
you're nice to look at,

00:50.016 --> 00:50.917
that's for goddamn sure.

00:51.017 --> 00:52.619
Unbelievable.

01:03.029 --> 01:05.899
Hey!

01:12.205 --> 01:13.873
Actor on set!

01:13.973 --> 01:15.075
Morning, Mr. Larson.

01:15.175 --> 01:18.078
Yeah, it is, Einstein.

01:18.178 --> 01:20.113
We have to get
your mic checked.

01:20.213 --> 01:22.082
Why is it so hot in here?

01:23.083 --> 01:24.017
Phew!
It's hot.

01:24.117 --> 01:25.919
Why is it
so goddamn hot in here?

01:26.019 --> 01:28.388
- Right this way, sir.
- Yeah...

01:31.191 --> 01:32.725
Damn, it's hot...

01:32.826 --> 01:34.727
Are you okay, Mr. Larson?

01:34.828 --> 01:37.230
Yeah, I'm fine, I just...

01:37.330 --> 01:38.765
I just feel...

01:38.865 --> 01:42.168
I just find it really hot.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.104
Whoa, oh my God!
Oh my God!

01:44.204 --> 01:46.906
I need a medic, stat!

01:47.006 --> 01:48.341
Mr. Larson?
Mr. Larson?

01:48.441 --> 01:49.642
We need a medic!

01:51.878 --> 01:52.979
Wow.

01:53.079 --> 01:55.615
I have never done
this much hardcore relaxing,

01:55.715 --> 01:56.950
and it is super weird,

01:57.050 --> 01:59.486
but I gotta say,
I don't hate it.

02:01.187 --> 02:03.923
Hmm, Candace.

02:04.023 --> 02:06.993
Well, you know,
we spend so much time

02:07.093 --> 02:08.094
working together;

02:08.194 --> 02:10.930
we should have
some fun together too.

02:11.030 --> 02:11.898
Definitely.

02:11.998 --> 02:13.466
You gotta set work
aside sometimes.

02:15.401 --> 02:16.803
It's
Candace Buchanan again.

02:16.903 --> 02:19.839
You remember, she played
Bryn Martell in the movies.

02:19.939 --> 02:21.608
Oh, yeah.
No, I remember.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.409
Well, I don't know.

02:23.510 --> 02:24.844
She's in town making a film.

02:24.944 --> 02:27.947
I thought maybe I'd invite her
over for dinner or something.

02:28.047 --> 02:31.050
You could do that...

02:31.151 --> 02:32.952
Whatever it is, just say it.

02:33.052 --> 02:33.987
Thank you.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.922
Okay...

02:36.022 --> 02:37.690
- The movies...
- Mm-hm?

02:37.790 --> 02:40.460
The heyday of Bryn-mania.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.330
I feel like that's
when I kind of lost you.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.232
Okay, I get it.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.835
I won't invite Candace over.

02:48.935 --> 02:50.103
No, you can.

02:50.203 --> 02:51.604
Have her over.
I've said my piece.

02:51.704 --> 02:55.642
I feel better and I trust
that if you have Candace over

02:55.742 --> 02:58.478
you won't let it spiral
into Bryn-sanity again.

02:58.578 --> 03:01.047
No, no,
Candace is good people.

03:01.147 --> 03:03.149
- You'll like her.
- Yeah, I will.

03:03.249 --> 03:05.218
- But down the line.
- Mm-hm.

03:05.318 --> 03:07.487
Now, this, right now,
this is "us" time.

03:07.587 --> 03:08.755
Thanks.

03:15.261 --> 03:17.397
Okay, she wants to
get in touch with you,

03:17.497 --> 03:20.533
so just knock yourself out.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.502
Hi, Candace.

03:22.602 --> 03:23.836
Vic?

03:23.937 --> 03:25.738
Are you really
a private investigator?

03:25.838 --> 03:26.773
- Yep.
- I need help!

03:26.873 --> 03:29.209
They're going to
accuse me of murder!

03:30.210 --> 03:34.681
I guess "us" time is over.

03:53.032 --> 03:55.101
Thanks so much.

03:55.201 --> 03:57.937
Okay, Alex is in the hospital
in stable condition.

03:58.037 --> 03:59.305
Oh, thank God!

03:59.405 --> 04:01.441
They're still waiting on
the tox screen and the analysis

04:01.541 --> 04:03.710
of the breakfast smoothie,
but they think it's possibly

04:03.810 --> 04:05.144
just cross-contamination
with tree nuts.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.780
Apparently he had
a severe tree nut allergy.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.116
- So that's good news.
- Mm-hm!

04:10.216 --> 04:11.851
Yeah.

04:11.951 --> 04:14.053
Why are you so upset, honey?

04:14.153 --> 04:17.223
There's so many strict rules
around Alex's allergy on set.

04:17.323 --> 04:19.425
If anything got near him,
it had to have been deliberate

04:19.525 --> 04:20.727
and they're gonna
think it was me!

04:20.827 --> 04:22.195
Why would they think it was you?

04:22.295 --> 04:23.830
Because we had words
in the past!

04:23.930 --> 04:25.498
Oh God, I need a cigarette.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.133
Wait, you're smoking again?

04:27.233 --> 04:30.236
Oh, I love you, Vic,
but please, go jump in a lake.

04:30.336 --> 04:32.272
What was your argument
with Alex about?

04:32.372 --> 04:34.140
I stuck up for someone
he was bullying.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.010
It led to an awful argument
and everyone found out about it.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.578
But you were
doing something kind.

04:38.678 --> 04:40.647
Surely everyone will understand.

04:40.747 --> 04:42.782
Yeah, but what if someone
who has a beef with him

04:42.882 --> 04:44.584
is letting me
take the fall for it?

04:44.684 --> 04:45.718
You're just being paranoid.

04:45.818 --> 04:48.621
I'm sure no one thinks
you're responsible.

04:48.721 --> 04:52.125
Yeah, uh, everyone thinks
Candace is responsible.

04:52.225 --> 04:53.893
Even if it was a practical joke,

04:53.993 --> 04:55.962
tree nut exposure
is really serious.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.764
I have a tree nut allergy too.

04:57.864 --> 05:00.533
Yeah, I noticed
your bracelet and the EpiPen.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.502
Uh, I can experience anaphylaxis

05:02.602 --> 05:06.172
if someone who's ingested
tree nuts even breathes on me.

05:06.272 --> 05:09.142
And he was like
right in my face.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.810
So, do you know anything?

05:10.910 --> 05:11.844
No, the hospital

05:11.944 --> 05:13.613
hasn't told us what
caused the collapse.

05:13.713 --> 05:15.214
I'm pretty sure
you would know by now

05:15.315 --> 05:17.317
if you were
experiencing anaphylaxis.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.786
What's this movie
about, anyway?

05:19.886 --> 05:22.689
Uh, Alex Larson wrote it.

05:22.789 --> 05:26.192
He plays a heart surgeon
eco-warrior who defeats this

05:26.292 --> 05:29.295
evil property developer
slash taxidermist.

05:29.395 --> 05:31.197
Candace is a lumber heiress

05:31.297 --> 05:32.899
turned park ranger
who helps him.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.368
- Mmm!
- Sounds... gripping.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.836
Ted, what you do on set?

05:36.936 --> 05:38.571
- I'm a TAD.
- What's that?

05:38.671 --> 05:40.473
Trainee assistant director.

05:40.573 --> 05:43.076
I... well...

05:43.176 --> 05:45.645
do what the other AD's
tell me to do.

05:45.745 --> 05:47.647
Generally getting
actors to and from.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.449
So, tell me,
Ted the TAD,

05:49.549 --> 05:52.552
why does everyone think
that Candace Buchanan did it?

05:52.652 --> 05:54.987
They had a huge fight
a while back

05:55.088 --> 05:57.090
and the whole thing
was caught on hot mics.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.159
And then, well,
people gossip a lot on set.

06:00.259 --> 06:02.695
Really?
Shocking.

06:02.795 --> 06:04.797
If they were wearing microphones
when they were fighting,

06:04.897 --> 06:06.599
would there be
a recording of it anywhere?

06:06.699 --> 06:08.534
- Yeah, I can look into it.
- Okay.

06:08.634 --> 06:10.236
And the person
that Alex berated,

06:10.336 --> 06:11.604
what happened to them?

06:11.704 --> 06:12.705
Nora.

06:12.805 --> 06:15.341
Uh, she was Alex's
personal assistant,

06:15.441 --> 06:17.443
until the big argument.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.679
Production felt bad, so they
reassigned her to catering.

06:19.779 --> 06:21.881
From personal assistant
to catering?

06:21.981 --> 06:25.284
Doesn't that require some
kind of culinary expertise?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.719
Not on this film, no.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.188
They're not shelling out
for fine cuisine.

06:29.288 --> 06:30.890
Nora, right?

06:30.990 --> 06:32.892
What did production
do to protect Alex

06:32.992 --> 06:34.227
from his tree nut allergy?

06:34.327 --> 06:36.062
It was like
the number one concern.

06:36.162 --> 06:39.065
We would have been fired if any
tree nuts got anywhere near him.

06:39.165 --> 06:41.234
There were notices
on every call sheet...

06:41.334 --> 06:43.035
- Ah.
- And frequent reminders

06:43.136 --> 06:44.637
during daily set
safety meetings.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.639
Alex's food was
hand-delivered to his trailer.

06:46.739 --> 06:47.907
By who?

06:48.007 --> 06:49.909
Sometimes Ted, because
they have the same allergy

06:50.009 --> 06:51.611
and their food
was prepared together.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.546
But because of budget,
there weren't enough people

06:53.646 --> 06:55.882
to go around, so sometimes
it was production assistants,

06:55.982 --> 06:57.150
hair and makeup...

06:57.250 --> 06:58.618
Really, whoever was available.

06:58.718 --> 07:00.119
So, other than
for food delivery,

07:00.219 --> 07:02.789
did anyone else have
access to his trailer?

07:02.889 --> 07:04.290
Well...

07:04.390 --> 07:07.160
I hate to say it,
but Candace Buchanan.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.895
Why do you say that?

07:08.995 --> 07:10.263
She got out of
hair and makeup first,

07:10.363 --> 07:12.665
so she would have had access
while he was being processed.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.133
I mean, she was nice to me,

07:14.233 --> 07:15.902
but it's kinda what
everybody else is saying.

07:16.002 --> 07:19.205
Tell me, Nora, did
you ever prepare Alex's food?

07:19.305 --> 07:20.072
Sure.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.507
But I just follow directions.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.776
Did you make
a smoothie this morning?

07:23.876 --> 07:25.645
I did.

07:25.745 --> 07:28.414
But I gave it to Ted,
whose allergy was way worse.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.716
If Alex ate tree nuts
and then yelled at Ted,

07:30.817 --> 07:33.619
Ted would be
in the hospital, too.

07:33.719 --> 07:35.588
I gotta go.

07:35.688 --> 07:39.625
Nice of Nora to throw
Candace under the bus.

07:39.725 --> 07:41.527
Not the most charitable,
I agree.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.729
Still, Candace had
the motive and, apparently,

07:43.830 --> 07:45.531
the opportunity.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.633
I am not giving up on my friend.

07:47.733 --> 07:50.336
Ooh! The fight between
Alex and Candace,

07:50.436 --> 07:52.738
Ted got a recording of it
from the sound department.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.108
[audio] Sure,
Nora's not the sharpest knife

07:56.209 --> 07:58.211
in the drawer, but you
don't treat people that way!

07:58.311 --> 07:59.812
What kind of monster
are you, Alex?

07:59.912 --> 08:01.447
God, I can't believe
I ever slept with you!

08:01.547 --> 08:03.182
[audio] Yeah, well,
I remember you being

08:03.282 --> 08:04.350
pretty into it.

08:04.450 --> 08:06.052
[audio] Oh!
Yeah, well, had I known

08:06.152 --> 08:08.654
at that time that you
were boning your aesthetician--

08:08.754 --> 08:10.156
Dermatologist!

08:10.256 --> 08:12.758
Okay, well, I think
that's quite enough of that.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.026
- Mm-hm.
- Yep.

08:14.126 --> 08:16.195
Why didn't you tell us
you were hooking up with Alex?

08:16.295 --> 08:18.898
Because if I could push
him off a building, I would.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.800
Well, when you make
a statement to the police,

08:20.900 --> 08:22.134
you might want to leave out

08:22.235 --> 08:24.103
the hypothetical desire
to murder him.

08:24.203 --> 08:26.072
When
were you seeing him?

08:26.172 --> 08:27.106
Years ago.

08:27.206 --> 08:28.574
Back when he was really sexy

08:28.674 --> 08:30.109
and not yet
a full-blown egomaniac.

08:30.209 --> 08:32.445
That argument had nothing
to do with the fact

08:32.545 --> 08:34.714
that I once made the mistake
of sleeping with him...

08:34.814 --> 08:36.916
for five months.

08:37.016 --> 08:39.418
So, your argument
was just about Nora?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.254
It was about the way
he treats people!

08:41.354 --> 08:43.389
The man is a waste of skin.

08:43.489 --> 08:45.725
Unfortunately, I need him. I...

08:45.825 --> 08:48.761
I need this whole
stupid movie to work.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.496
Oh, Vic...

08:50.596 --> 08:53.366
I'm this close to bankruptcy.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.401
I've been making
my own beauty products

08:55.501 --> 08:59.205
and selling them on Etsy
under a fake name.

08:59.305 --> 09:01.874
"All natural ingredients."

09:01.974 --> 09:03.075
It's gone pretty well.

09:03.175 --> 09:06.012
I mean, I'm just...
selling off the last of them.

09:06.112 --> 09:07.547
As Bryn Martell says...

09:07.647 --> 09:10.116
"Always have a backup plan."

09:10.216 --> 09:11.551
Where were you
this morning

09:11.651 --> 09:13.352
leading up to Alex's collapse?

09:13.452 --> 09:15.855
We just have to cover
all our bases, Candace.

09:15.955 --> 09:18.024
It's fine, I get it.

09:18.124 --> 09:19.525
My driver picked me up at 6:30,

09:19.625 --> 09:21.227
and then I went straight
to hair and makeup

09:21.327 --> 09:23.062
and that's when we all heard
about Alex's collapse,

09:23.162 --> 09:25.398
when a PA brought me my coffee.
They can confirm.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.867
And you mentioned someone else
might have issues with Alex?

09:27.967 --> 09:30.670
Well, I'm sure
lots of people hate him.

09:30.770 --> 09:33.039
Talk to the executive producer,
Nadine, if you can.

09:33.139 --> 09:36.409
I know she's been on Zoom calls
all morning with the studio;

09:36.509 --> 09:37.543
maybe tomorrow.

09:37.643 --> 09:40.379
They may have to declare
a force majeure.

09:40.479 --> 09:42.281
Ms. Buchanan?

09:42.381 --> 09:46.118
They're ready for you.

09:46.218 --> 09:48.854
Time to make the donuts.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.596
Okay, one more there...

09:56.696 --> 09:59.065
And here...

09:59.165 --> 10:01.701
Ha-ha!
And there we go!

10:01.801 --> 10:03.903
And...

10:04.003 --> 10:06.939
I have two mock-ups
for the new cover of

10:07.039 --> 10:09.408
"The Progeny's Puzzle"!

10:09.508 --> 10:10.943
Well, I like them,

10:11.043 --> 10:13.279
but don't you think there should
be a hint of Clodagh in them?

10:13.379 --> 10:14.313
Yeah, I thought so too.

10:14.413 --> 10:16.949
I'm telling you,
The Unsolved Press team

10:17.049 --> 10:18.551
are in love with it!

10:18.651 --> 10:22.521
They want a four-book deal with
this new Bryn/Clodagh pairing.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.458
They're even talking about
starting the movies up again!

10:25.558 --> 10:26.959
What?!

10:27.059 --> 10:31.731
But right now, they want
to plan a 25-city book tour.

10:31.831 --> 10:34.100
Maybe you and Darby could
treat it like a mini-vacay.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.502
Well, I don't know.
With our new business--

10:36.602 --> 10:38.104
But you're gonna tell her, right?

10:39.605 --> 10:41.540
Vic, she's probably gonna
notice if you just disappear

10:41.641 --> 10:42.575
for a few months.

10:42.675 --> 10:43.976
- Okay, I'll figure it out.
- Okay.

10:44.076 --> 10:46.278
- But timing is everything.
- Yes, fine.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.346
Hey, Sarita!

10:47.446 --> 10:49.248
Oh, hey, Darby!
Good to see you.

10:49.348 --> 10:50.316
You too.

10:50.416 --> 10:51.951
Uh, I was just leaving actually.

10:52.051 --> 10:53.285
- Oh?
- Yeah.

10:53.386 --> 10:54.320
Everything okay?

10:54.420 --> 10:56.489
Yes, everything is great!

10:56.589 --> 10:58.157
Great,
I'll show you out.

10:58.257 --> 10:59.492
- Okay, sure!
- Mm-hm.

10:59.592 --> 11:00.993
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:04.563 --> 11:06.799
Hey, Lucas.
Did you find out anything?

11:06.899 --> 11:09.802
Uh, yeah.

11:09.902 --> 11:11.737
Listen,
I'm totally breaching

11:11.837 --> 11:13.773
patient confidentiality here,

11:13.873 --> 11:15.508
but I do want to
give you a heads-up

11:15.608 --> 11:17.843
given that Mr. Larson's
co-star is your client.

11:17.943 --> 11:19.478
Appreciated.

11:19.578 --> 11:22.181
It's looking like
it's not an allergic reaction.

11:22.281 --> 11:23.649
Oh, what is it?

11:23.749 --> 11:27.386
Still running tests, but his
symptoms point to toxicity.

11:27.486 --> 11:29.755
- Like...?
- Poisoning.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.991
Meaning this wasn't an accident?

11:32.091 --> 11:33.559
The hospital, of course,
is gonna provide

11:33.659 --> 11:36.529
this information to the police,
which means that--

11:36.629 --> 11:40.499
This will officially become an
attempted murder investigation.

11:48.941 --> 11:51.410
I did some research
into the force majeure thing

11:51.510 --> 11:54.180
that Candace mentioned;
it's an insurance term

11:54.280 --> 11:56.148
which protects the show
from major losses

11:56.248 --> 11:57.483
if the production shuts down.

11:57.583 --> 11:58.818
Hmm, like a bailout?

11:58.918 --> 12:00.753
Yeah, and since everyone says

12:00.853 --> 12:02.421
that the show
is in financial trouble,

12:02.521 --> 12:05.357
it might be just the thing
to save the producers' necks.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.859
Wow, look who's here!

12:06.959 --> 12:08.728
Alder Bluffs' answer
to the Gilmore Girls!

12:08.828 --> 12:11.931
And Alder Bluffs'
answer to Miami Vice!

12:12.031 --> 12:13.332
Ha-ha.

12:13.432 --> 12:16.168
I'm guessing you two are here
for the same reason we are.

12:16.268 --> 12:19.605
To avail ourselves
of the free snacks?

12:19.705 --> 12:22.208
Look, here's the thing,
Spencer Not-Really-Sisters:

12:22.308 --> 12:24.009
this is a police investigation, okay?

12:24.110 --> 12:25.077
Of course.

12:25.177 --> 12:27.613
We wouldn't dream of
getting in your way.

12:27.713 --> 12:29.548
Good.

12:29.648 --> 12:31.917
Psst!
Hey, Zane!

12:32.017 --> 12:34.787
Someone went out and got
a whole new work wardrobe.

12:34.887 --> 12:37.323
Yeah, it's, uh,
been a busy time.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.024
Graham!
Come on, let's go!

12:39.125 --> 12:41.694
We gotta go find
ourselves a movie star.

12:41.794 --> 12:43.462
We'll catch up later.

12:43.562 --> 12:46.198
Okay.

12:46.298 --> 12:47.399
Hmm!

12:47.500 --> 12:49.435
I should call Candace.

12:49.535 --> 12:52.371
Okay, but first
let's go find that producer.

12:52.471 --> 12:56.475
Reminder to call Javier at MGM,
also cancel my massage,

12:56.575 --> 12:58.477
also remind Carrie
to feed Simba.

12:58.577 --> 13:01.213
Hi, I have, like, three minutes.
What do you need?

13:01.313 --> 13:03.649
We're hoping you can
answer some questions for us.

13:03.749 --> 13:05.384
We understand the production

13:05.484 --> 13:08.120
is experiencing
some financial troubles.

13:08.220 --> 13:10.289
Huh!
Candace told you this?

13:10.389 --> 13:12.725
And she might have
mentioned the possibility

13:12.825 --> 13:15.394
of declaring a force majeure.

13:15.494 --> 13:17.963
Reminder to not discuss
business with friends.

13:18.063 --> 13:19.365
We also heard from the crew

13:19.465 --> 13:21.300
about a general
lack of resources.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.402
Reminder
to get all crew to sign

13:23.502 --> 13:25.104
their non-disclosure agreements!

13:25.204 --> 13:28.040
Why is the budget so strained?

13:28.140 --> 13:30.309
Among other things,
the insurance company

13:30.409 --> 13:32.978
decided to double our premium
at the last minute.

13:33.078 --> 13:34.980
Because the plot
was so convoluted?

13:35.080 --> 13:38.284
Alex Larson is...

13:38.384 --> 13:39.819
He's an audience draw,
for sure,

13:39.919 --> 13:42.488
but he is also
a total lawsuit magnet,

13:42.588 --> 13:44.223
which sometimes
makes it a little hard to...

13:44.323 --> 13:45.758
finish a movie!

13:45.858 --> 13:47.059
So, declaring a force majeure

13:47.159 --> 13:50.029
would bail you out of
a serious financial jam?

13:50.129 --> 13:54.233
Uh, you think
I hospitalized my own star?

13:54.333 --> 13:56.335
Okay, I'm gonna make this
really easy for you.

13:56.435 --> 13:58.604
It's not me.
Okay?

13:58.704 --> 14:01.807
Seriously, force majeure
is not winning the lottery.

14:01.907 --> 14:05.144
All it does is cover the cost of
a shutdown if we stop filming.

14:05.244 --> 14:08.214
We are shooting around Alex
as well as we can.

14:08.314 --> 14:11.383
I need this movie to get made
and I need it to be a hit,

14:11.483 --> 14:14.119
so neither of my stars
can die or get locked up,

14:14.220 --> 14:15.688
at least until it's in the can.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.823
Plus, Candace is my friend.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.892
Blabbermouth notwithstanding.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.828
And why would I implicate
the other star of the movie

14:22.928 --> 14:25.531
that I so desperately
need to succeed?

14:25.631 --> 14:26.799
Fair point.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.968
Yes.
Can you two...

14:29.068 --> 14:30.169
figure this out, please?

14:30.269 --> 14:33.038
Because I trust you more
than that bonehead detective

14:33.138 --> 14:34.473
who just left.
Who was that?

14:34.573 --> 14:37.810
Um, here is a list
of our entire crew,

14:37.910 --> 14:41.080
and I will also get somebody
from our production office

14:41.180 --> 14:42.982
to bring you
today's security log.

14:43.082 --> 14:44.750
Okay?
Thank you.

14:44.850 --> 14:46.552
Alright, I am back.

14:46.652 --> 14:48.487
Can somebody please
get me up to speed?

14:48.587 --> 14:49.955
When we get a copy
of the security log,

14:50.055 --> 14:51.123
we should take it to Candace

14:51.223 --> 14:52.858
and see if any names
jump out at her.

14:52.958 --> 14:55.227
And find out if and how she
actually is friends with Nadine.

14:55.327 --> 14:56.228
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.

14:56.328 --> 14:57.396
Oh, you know, Mom,

14:57.496 --> 14:58.697
I should probably
take this, so...

14:58.797 --> 15:01.433
why don't I meet you
at Candace's trailer?

15:04.503 --> 15:05.504
Hey, Alastair.

15:05.604 --> 15:07.373
It is crucial we meet.

15:07.473 --> 15:09.508
You're gonna wanna
hear this about Billy.

15:09.608 --> 15:12.011
I thought I told you to drop
the investigation into Billy!

15:12.111 --> 15:13.112
Yes, I-I heard that.

15:13.212 --> 15:14.780
Well, so, you know,
I might have...

15:14.880 --> 15:17.016
obtained some satellite
and surveillance imagery

15:17.116 --> 15:19.618
that puts Billy in North America

15:19.718 --> 15:22.087
long before
he said he moved here.

15:22.187 --> 15:23.656
Couldn't he have
been on vacation?

15:23.756 --> 15:24.924
For seven months?

15:25.024 --> 15:27.126
Come on, look,
I know he's rich,

15:27.226 --> 15:29.795
but the real question is
whether or not

15:29.895 --> 15:33.599
he got cosmetic surgery...
to disguise himself.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.901
Oh, for--
Okay, listen, Alastair.

15:36.001 --> 15:37.870
My mom is really
happy with Billy.

15:37.970 --> 15:40.372
Do you think that's maybe
part of your problem?

15:40.472 --> 15:41.607
Of course not.

15:41.707 --> 15:43.242
Meanwhile, none of
your so-called "proof"

15:43.342 --> 15:45.945
gives me any reason to get
in the way of that happiness.

15:46.045 --> 15:47.146
I really think that you--

15:47.246 --> 15:49.081
I don't want to be a jerk,

15:49.181 --> 15:51.216
but seriously, dude,
you gotta let it go.

15:51.317 --> 15:52.718
Let me just
send you some pictures!

15:52.818 --> 15:55.354
Alastair?
Stop.

15:59.658 --> 16:02.227
Hmm... alright.
That matches.

16:04.530 --> 16:07.132
Candace confirmed it--
she is friends with Nadine.

16:07.232 --> 16:09.735
And a friend in Hollywood
is worth their weight in gold.

16:09.835 --> 16:11.303
Yet another reason
why I wouldn't want

16:11.403 --> 16:12.838
to harm the production.

16:12.938 --> 16:14.406
Who is this Brock Duhaime?

16:14.506 --> 16:16.976
Uh, he came here this morning
but I didn't see him

16:17.076 --> 16:19.345
on the crew list,
and he comes all the time.

16:19.445 --> 16:20.946
Yeah.
Brock's my stalker.

16:21.046 --> 16:22.281
Excuse me?!

16:22.381 --> 16:25.517
Well, more of a fan with
light stalker-ish tendencies.

16:25.617 --> 16:26.518
What?

16:26.618 --> 16:28.253
He stopped by
with flowers so often,

16:28.354 --> 16:30.723
eventually they just
waved him in after a while.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.524
Admittedly,
security was terrible.

16:32.624 --> 16:34.693
Yeah,
we just walked right in.

16:34.793 --> 16:37.029
But Brock is sweety.
He's... he's harmless!

16:37.129 --> 16:39.631
In my experience,
the line between harmless fan

16:39.732 --> 16:42.501
and dangerous criminal
is pretty thin.

16:42.601 --> 16:44.336
Where can
we find this Brock?

16:44.436 --> 16:45.504
Oh, I don't know.

16:45.604 --> 16:46.672
It's a one-way stalking.

16:46.772 --> 16:48.040
You said he brought
these flowers?

16:48.140 --> 16:50.109
Yeah.

16:50.209 --> 16:52.378
They're from the same florist.

16:52.478 --> 16:55.014
"Merci Bouquets"?

16:55.114 --> 16:57.282
Now, that is criminal.

16:58.450 --> 17:01.020
It took some convincing,
but the florist says

17:01.120 --> 17:03.756
this is the billing address,
number two.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.858
A stalker,
in a basement apartment?

17:05.958 --> 17:08.660
- You don't say!
- Stand back.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.563
Creepy guys in basements
is where I shine.

17:11.663 --> 17:12.798
May I help you?

17:12.898 --> 17:14.800
Hi, I'm Darby, and this is--

17:14.900 --> 17:16.135
Victoria Spencer!

17:16.235 --> 17:18.637
Creator of Bryn Martell,
the Bryn Martell books,

17:18.737 --> 17:20.939
the Bryn Martell movies--
Oh!

17:21.040 --> 17:24.877
Come in, come in!
Come in, come in, come in!

17:29.948 --> 17:31.383
Come in!

17:31.483 --> 17:33.085
What?!

17:41.260 --> 17:44.863
And this right here
is my wall of fame.

17:44.963 --> 17:46.198
It's beautiful.

17:46.298 --> 17:47.933
So it's like a shrine?

17:48.033 --> 17:50.169
Oh, you're too kind!

17:50.269 --> 17:54.706
Now, can I interest you
in some Yirgacheffe espresso?

17:54.807 --> 17:56.375
And now you're too kind!

17:56.475 --> 17:59.912
I'll be right back!

18:00.012 --> 18:02.948
Maybe lay off the Yirgacheffe?
We're investigating a poisoner!

18:03.048 --> 18:04.416
Okay!
I just...

18:04.516 --> 18:06.919
I didn't know that you
cared if I got poisoned.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.954
I care about losing
my business partner.

18:09.054 --> 18:11.423
Here we are!

18:11.523 --> 18:12.925
Ha-ha...

18:13.025 --> 18:14.660
Help yourself.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.128
So, tell us, Brock,

18:16.228 --> 18:18.897
what do you know about
Candace's co-star, Alex Larson?

18:18.997 --> 18:20.899
Hmm,
I know all about that one.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.935
He's a real degenerate,
if you ask me.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.771
A real loathsome piece of work.

18:25.871 --> 18:27.439
And on what
do you base

18:27.539 --> 18:29.308
this strongly held opinion?

18:29.408 --> 18:31.009
Research, dear lady.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.711
Tell us about this research.

18:32.811 --> 18:34.546
What'd you learn about Alex?

18:34.646 --> 18:36.548
He was awful to Candace.

18:36.648 --> 18:39.118
She gave up work
to go on a trip with him,

18:39.218 --> 18:41.854
and he dumped her
the day before.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.023
It just makes my blood boil!

18:45.124 --> 18:46.658
Oh...

18:46.758 --> 18:48.060
I know what you're thinking.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.095
- What are we thinking?
- Please.

18:50.195 --> 18:52.598
Well, his suspected poisoning,
her presumed guilt,

18:52.698 --> 18:55.434
it's all over the Bryn Martell
message boards.

18:55.534 --> 18:57.336
But you think I'm the culprit.

18:57.436 --> 18:59.438
- So tell us why you couldn't be.
- Please!

18:59.538 --> 19:03.275
What, commit a crime
and implicate dear Candace?

19:03.375 --> 19:05.978
Not a chance!

19:06.078 --> 19:07.246
But I can assure you,

19:07.346 --> 19:11.717
there are scores of people
who want Alex dead.

19:11.817 --> 19:16.355
And he leaves scorched earth
wherever he goes!

19:16.455 --> 19:17.890
Where were you
this morning, Brock?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.424
I was getting a tattoo, actually.

19:19.525 --> 19:20.526
Oh, really?

19:20.626 --> 19:23.328
You don't seem like
a tattoo kind of guy.

19:23.428 --> 19:24.630
Could we see it?

19:24.730 --> 19:26.398
Well, yes!

19:26.498 --> 19:28.634
I'll have to change
into my Speedo first.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.169
You know what?
We have, uh--

19:30.269 --> 19:32.471
we have so much to do,
and we'll have to just

19:32.571 --> 19:33.906
take a rain check on the Speedo.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.307
Oh, you'd love it!

19:35.407 --> 19:38.377
It's Bryn Martell
reading a Bryn Martell novel!

19:38.477 --> 19:39.611
Eugh!

19:39.711 --> 19:40.946
Oh, it's a text from Lucas.

19:41.046 --> 19:42.681
He has an update for us
at the hospital.

19:42.781 --> 19:44.583
- We should head there.
- No, I have drinks with Candace.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.386
I'm gonna need a few to get
that image out of my mind.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.528
- Hey!
- Oh, hey.

19:56.628 --> 19:58.030
What is all this?

19:58.130 --> 19:59.631
Why aren't you in your uniform?

19:59.731 --> 20:01.233
Yeah.
Sorry I didn't tell you.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.902
I, uh, took, and passed,
the detective exam.

20:04.002 --> 20:05.837
What?
When?

20:05.938 --> 20:07.906
Why, thank you.
Such kind words.

20:08.006 --> 20:10.108
Sorry, no, I'm...
I'm happy for you.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.843
That's awesome!
Congrats.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.011
I'm just surprised.

20:13.111 --> 20:15.314
It's like when we were 16
and you pierced your ear

20:15.414 --> 20:16.481
without telling me first.

20:16.582 --> 20:18.517
Yeah, well, I was worried
about passing the exam

20:18.617 --> 20:19.918
so I only told Antonio.

20:20.018 --> 20:21.987
Look, if you want to
get caught up, we can,

20:22.087 --> 20:23.188
but not right now.

20:23.288 --> 20:24.556
I gotta go.

20:24.656 --> 20:26.225
Okay.

20:26.325 --> 20:27.593
Bye!

20:33.298 --> 20:37.336
Remember when it was your turn,
you just shouted,

20:37.436 --> 20:40.005
"Oscar de la Renta!"
and ran down the red carpet?

20:40.105 --> 20:41.340
Okay, not my best moment,

20:41.440 --> 20:43.542
but I really needed
to use the bathroom!

20:43.642 --> 20:46.345
Those were good times!

20:46.445 --> 20:47.913
I should put that in a book.

20:48.013 --> 20:49.881
What is going on there?

20:49.982 --> 20:51.750
I can't believe you just
gave up your whole career

20:51.850 --> 20:52.718
to become a PI.

20:52.818 --> 20:53.752
I haven't.

20:53.852 --> 20:55.621
In fact, it's helped
my writing immensely.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.256
I just completed a new book

20:57.356 --> 21:01.059
and my publisher wants me
to go on a 25-city book tour!

21:01.159 --> 21:03.895
What?!
Congratulations!

21:03.996 --> 21:07.499
- To comebacks.
- To comebacks.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.101
Hmm...

21:09.201 --> 21:12.371
Do you mind if I just
nip outside for one second?

21:12.471 --> 21:13.939
Candace, really...

21:14.039 --> 21:15.374
Oh my goodness.

21:15.474 --> 21:16.908
Okay, Mom!

21:17.009 --> 21:18.277
Calm down.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.212
Now I see what
Darby has to put up with.

21:20.312 --> 21:22.314
I'm sorry.
I just...

21:22.414 --> 21:25.117
I care enough
to be a pain in the ass.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.986
Hmm, apparently.

21:28.086 --> 21:30.889
So...

21:30.989 --> 21:32.457
What are the new books about?

21:32.557 --> 21:35.961
Bryn's long-lost daughter,
Clodagh, returns.

21:36.061 --> 21:37.462
Wow!

21:37.562 --> 21:40.265
Darby must be so touched.

21:40.365 --> 21:42.968
Actually, Darby's not
much of a fan of the books.

21:43.068 --> 21:46.204
In fact, I don't think she's
ever read a single one of them.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.239
What?

21:47.339 --> 21:48.940
- Not even the first one?
- No.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.143
Wait, she has no idea
that Bryn's unhappy marriage

21:51.243 --> 21:53.145
is based off you and Sam?

21:53.245 --> 21:54.780
No.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.748
When I first wrote the books,

21:56.848 --> 21:59.017
I never thought they'd be
published, let alone--

21:59.117 --> 22:02.721
Read and seen by millions?

22:02.821 --> 22:04.456
She'd just lost her father.

22:04.556 --> 22:08.827
I didn't want to
taint her image of him.

22:08.927 --> 22:11.296
I figured maybe one day
she'd read the book.

22:11.396 --> 22:13.031
Sure.

22:13.131 --> 22:16.034
My shrink would call that
"avoidance coping."

22:16.134 --> 22:17.102
Hmph!

22:17.202 --> 22:18.770
Dr. Kim to Geriatrics...

22:18.870 --> 22:21.740
He's out of critical danger,
but he still has a ways to go.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.709
We were able to get him
the proper antidote

22:23.809 --> 22:25.344
once we confirmed
cyanide toxicity.

22:25.444 --> 22:26.378
Wait, what?!

22:26.478 --> 22:28.280
Who's behind this, the KGB?

22:28.380 --> 22:30.449
Where would someone get cyanide?

22:30.549 --> 22:32.217
The internet, for one, but...

22:32.317 --> 22:34.319
that would most likely
be an injection.

22:34.419 --> 22:36.355
- There's no sign of that.
- So then...?

22:36.455 --> 22:38.323
Naturally occurring cyanide
isn't hard to find.

22:38.423 --> 22:40.559
Most grocery, health food
stores have lots of it.

22:40.659 --> 22:41.793
Seriously?

22:41.893 --> 22:44.496
Cassava, tapioca,
bitter almonds, apricot kernels,

22:44.596 --> 22:46.865
all contain small
amounts of amygdalin,

22:46.965 --> 22:48.867
which releases cyanide
after being eaten.

22:48.967 --> 22:51.303
Trace amounts of amygdalin
were found in the smoothie

22:51.403 --> 22:52.637
that he had this morning.

22:52.738 --> 22:55.340
You know, Candace Buchanan
makes all these beauty products,

22:55.440 --> 22:59.344
and I'm pretty sure I saw
an apricot kernel facial scrub.

22:59.444 --> 23:00.912
How many apricot kernels

23:01.012 --> 23:03.014
would I have to ingest
to get poisoned?

23:03.115 --> 23:05.884
I think that the medical
term for that would be, um,

23:05.984 --> 23:07.018
"a boatload."

23:07.119 --> 23:09.054
Okay, so then instead
of all at once,

23:09.154 --> 23:11.556
it would have to be,
like, smaller amounts,

23:11.656 --> 23:13.024
over a long period of time?

23:13.125 --> 23:15.260
The culprit would have
needed access to Alex's food,

23:15.360 --> 23:16.361
for weeks.

23:16.461 --> 23:19.264
Like... the length
of a movie production.

23:19.364 --> 23:22.134
Yeah, that, uh,
that sounds about right.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.301
You okay?

23:23.402 --> 23:25.137
You don't seem like
your normal, perky self.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.571
Ah...

23:26.671 --> 23:28.507
Lindsay and I are, um...

23:28.607 --> 23:30.442
We're sorting things out.

23:30.542 --> 23:33.311
Sorry to hear that.

23:39.484 --> 23:40.852
Hi, Mom.

23:40.952 --> 23:42.654
Is everything okay?

23:45.190 --> 23:46.591
Mom?

23:46.691 --> 23:48.026
Oh, nice!

23:48.126 --> 23:50.529
You're just in time
for the star's grand exit.

23:50.629 --> 23:53.131
It wasn't me, I swear!

23:53.231 --> 23:54.533
Zane?

23:54.633 --> 23:56.501
Candace, we're right behind you!

23:56.601 --> 23:59.037
What's happening?

24:11.583 --> 24:13.051
You.

24:16.087 --> 24:17.823
- Hi, Victoria.
- Mm-hm!

24:17.923 --> 24:19.591
You can't keep me
waiting all night.

24:19.691 --> 24:21.092
What has happened to my client?

24:21.193 --> 24:23.161
Oh, it's not a big deal.
I'm just charging her

24:23.261 --> 24:25.464
- with attempted murder.
- On what grounds?

24:25.564 --> 24:27.999
On the grounds of
a grinder, actually.

24:28.099 --> 24:30.135
And apricot kernels
we found in her trailer,

24:30.235 --> 24:31.303
right next to Larson's.

24:31.403 --> 24:32.704
That's means and opportunity.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.673
Oh, and motive, that's right.

24:34.773 --> 24:38.310
"Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned."

24:38.410 --> 24:39.578
Shakespeare.

24:39.678 --> 24:42.881
Hmph! Actually,
William Congreve, but nice try.

24:42.981 --> 24:44.483
- Whatever.
- Can I see her?

24:44.583 --> 24:46.284
No.
No, you can't.

24:46.384 --> 24:47.586
She's in processing.

24:47.686 --> 24:49.855
But you can see her later.
Just come back tomorrow.

24:49.955 --> 24:51.490
Or wait longer.

24:51.590 --> 24:52.891
Ah...

24:52.991 --> 24:54.226
God, that felt good!

24:54.326 --> 24:57.262
Zane?
Hey!

24:57.362 --> 24:59.264
You owe me an explanation.

24:59.364 --> 25:00.332
About?

25:00.432 --> 25:02.434
Well, you blew me off
at the hospital,

25:02.534 --> 25:05.403
knowing you were going
to arrest Candace at my house.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.639
Why are you so secretive
all of a sudden?

25:07.739 --> 25:09.074
Keeping a police matter
confidential?

25:09.174 --> 25:11.009
That's called doing my job.

25:11.109 --> 25:13.078
Okay, and what about
taking the detective exam?

25:13.178 --> 25:14.846
I've been thinking
about taking it for ages,

25:14.946 --> 25:16.748
even before you
came back to Alder Bluffs,

25:16.848 --> 25:18.517
but how would you know that?

25:18.617 --> 25:20.385
What does that mean?

25:20.485 --> 25:21.753
Since you've been back,

25:21.853 --> 25:24.055
all we talk about
are your problems.

25:24.155 --> 25:25.490
"My mom's a narcissist."

25:25.590 --> 25:26.925
"Can you look up
a record for me?"

25:27.025 --> 25:28.527
"I need some facts
about a case."

25:28.627 --> 25:31.196
"Is it okay to pine for Lucas
when I'm dating Des?"

25:31.296 --> 25:32.264
Harsh.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.165
Sometimes I feel like
you have no room

25:34.266 --> 25:35.667
for what's happening in my life.

25:35.767 --> 25:39.037
Graham!
I need you back in here, stat!

25:39.137 --> 25:42.207
'Cause you're not the only one
with a challenging co-worker.

25:42.307 --> 25:44.643
Yeah?

25:56.688 --> 25:59.224
Hey, I wasn't expecting you.
What are you doing up?

25:59.324 --> 26:01.026
Couldn't sleep.

26:01.126 --> 26:03.128
Me neither.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.864
It's been a long time since
Candace and I were friends,

26:05.964 --> 26:09.534
but I can't believe that someone
who could play Bryn Martell

26:09.634 --> 26:10.969
would do something like this.

26:11.069 --> 26:14.272
Well, I'm learning
friends can surprise you.

26:14.372 --> 26:17.409
- Hmm.
- Check it out.

26:17.509 --> 26:18.610
Gossip websites?

26:18.710 --> 26:20.712
You continually
surprise me too.

26:20.812 --> 26:23.648
No, I'm rethinking
what Brock said about Alex

26:23.748 --> 26:25.917
leaving a trail of destruction
wherever he goes.

26:26.017 --> 26:28.286
And Nadine said he was
a "lawsuit magnet."

26:28.386 --> 26:29.454
Mm-hm.

26:29.554 --> 26:31.556
This is a real-time chronicle
of Alex's antics

26:31.656 --> 26:33.758
when he was filming
several different movies.

26:33.858 --> 26:36.695
Paternity suit in LA...

26:36.795 --> 26:39.998
Hotel room trashed
in Santa Fe...

26:41.466 --> 26:44.803
Driver fired after
a car crash in Kitsilano...

26:44.903 --> 26:47.572
Stunt man injured
in a film in Detroit.

26:47.672 --> 26:49.174
- Not far from here.
- Yeah.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.776
Maybe someone from one of
these movie set came up here

26:51.876 --> 26:53.178
with an axe to grind.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.279
An axe?

26:54.379 --> 26:57.649
Or an apricot kernel?

26:57.749 --> 26:58.617
Oh, boy.

27:01.853 --> 27:03.955
Nadine, we've
been going over this list,

27:04.055 --> 27:06.858
and we would like to ask you
some questions about your crew,

27:06.958 --> 27:10.161
specifically if there are
any out-of-town hires.

27:10.261 --> 27:13.365
Only Candace and Alex,
our Hollywood stars.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.433
Oh, and our
director of photography.

27:15.533 --> 27:16.768
He is from Québec.

27:16.868 --> 27:18.470
Anyone from Detroit?

27:18.570 --> 27:19.504
Or Michigan?

27:19.604 --> 27:21.106
No, everybody's
from around here.

27:21.206 --> 27:22.474
I signed off on the paperwork,

27:22.574 --> 27:24.376
so I would definitely
remember work visas.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.811
Yeah, hang on.

27:26.911 --> 27:28.647
I need to meet with
my production manager.

27:28.747 --> 27:29.814
Can you keep me posted?

27:29.914 --> 27:32.317
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

27:32.417 --> 27:34.285
- Whoa!
- Be careful, please!

27:34.386 --> 27:38.857
Bears and skis and surgeons...

27:38.957 --> 27:41.493
What isn't in this movie?

27:41.593 --> 27:45.630
Wasn't one of Alex's incidents
in Kitsilano, in Vancouver?

27:45.730 --> 27:47.866
Yes, I think so.

27:47.966 --> 27:50.669
Well, I was just thinking,
remember that guy, Ted,

27:50.769 --> 27:52.303
the TAD we met yesterday?

27:52.404 --> 27:54.906
He was wearing
a ski school instructor T-shirt

27:55.006 --> 27:57.509
from Whistler.
What if he's not from Ontario?

27:57.609 --> 27:59.110
What if he's from BC?

27:59.210 --> 28:02.047
He's the one who brings
Alex's food most of the time.

28:02.147 --> 28:04.482
That's because
he had the same allergy.

28:04.582 --> 28:07.986
But he did seem
a little fuzzy on anaphylaxis.

28:08.086 --> 28:10.822
Yeah, I thought so, too!
It was really weird, right?

28:10.922 --> 28:14.859
What if the allergy was just
a ruse, to gain access to Alex?

28:14.959 --> 28:16.761
Huh...

28:16.861 --> 28:18.697
I know who to call.

28:19.831 --> 28:21.032
Hi.
Alastair?

28:21.132 --> 28:24.002
- Hey, listen, I need a favour.
- What do you need?

28:24.102 --> 28:29.174
I'm looking for, uh,
a guy named Ted, maybe Theodore,

28:29.274 --> 28:33.445
Gopnik, um, to see if he has
a severe tree nut allergy.

28:33.545 --> 28:37.916
Something that would show up
on a MedicAlert bracelet.

28:38.016 --> 28:40.051
Okay, checking.

28:40.151 --> 28:41.152
He's checking.

28:41.252 --> 28:43.154
So...
while I have you--

28:43.254 --> 28:45.056
Nope,
gonna stop you there.

28:45.156 --> 28:48.093
Thank you so much.
We're good.

28:48.193 --> 28:49.494
Fine.

28:49.594 --> 28:52.230
One in Ontario...

28:52.330 --> 28:54.032
Theodore Gopnik.

28:54.132 --> 28:55.200
He is 85.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.568
He lives in Thunder Bay.

28:56.668 --> 28:59.270
No known allergies.

28:59.370 --> 29:00.839
That's your guy?

29:00.939 --> 29:02.974
Ted lied.

29:03.074 --> 29:05.143
"Ted" isn't Ted's real name.

29:12.217 --> 29:14.319
Ted?

29:17.322 --> 29:20.325
Go.
Let's act fast.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.193
Okay.

29:25.330 --> 29:28.500
I don't really know
what we're looking for.

29:30.702 --> 29:34.038
Whoa, Mom!

29:34.139 --> 29:36.274
- Apricot kernels.
- What?

29:36.374 --> 29:39.444
The waybill
is addressed to Surrey, BC,

29:39.544 --> 29:42.113
to a guy named Derek Wilkies.

29:42.213 --> 29:43.815
Why does that sound so familiar?

29:43.915 --> 29:45.550
Let me look it up.

29:45.650 --> 29:48.820
The name of the driver in
Kitsilano who lost his license

29:48.920 --> 29:51.556
because of Alex
was Damon Wilkies!

29:51.656 --> 29:54.959
His son was a medical
student named Derek.

29:55.059 --> 29:57.428
That's Ted the TAD!

29:57.529 --> 29:59.531
So, what, he wanted revenge

29:59.631 --> 30:02.267
and he saw Candace
as a fall-guy?

30:02.367 --> 30:06.204
Ugh, well, if he isn't here,
where is he?

30:06.304 --> 30:09.374
Oh...

30:09.474 --> 30:10.708
Hey, look at this.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.945
"Wednesday - Surgery Scene:
Ace Flanagan."

30:14.045 --> 30:17.215
Why would there be
an empty costume bag in here?

30:17.315 --> 30:18.983
Unless Derek changed into it.

30:19.083 --> 30:21.786
- And no longer needs these.
- His EpiPen!

30:21.886 --> 30:23.988
I knew
that was a fake allergy!

30:24.088 --> 30:27.258
Maybe he was trying to slip
into the hospital unnoticed.

30:27.358 --> 30:28.860
I'll call Zane.

30:31.896 --> 30:33.698
Everything seems
pretty normal here.

30:33.798 --> 30:36.301
Well, maybe we were wrong.
Is Alex's room down here?

30:36.401 --> 30:38.002
Yeah, it's this one.

30:39.871 --> 30:42.974
Oh, good, Lucas is in there.

30:43.074 --> 30:44.409
Darby, wait, no!

30:44.509 --> 30:45.910
Oh, what are you doing here?

30:46.010 --> 30:48.279
Please, please, please!

30:48.379 --> 30:49.981
No, hey,
I wouldn't do that.

30:50.081 --> 30:51.182
Hey!

30:51.282 --> 30:52.383
Help!

30:52.483 --> 30:54.219
Hey, hello?!
Can you hear me!

30:54.319 --> 30:56.054
Help!
- DARBY Hello?

30:56.154 --> 30:57.355
Help!

30:57.455 --> 31:00.358
This is Dr. Lucas Collins.

31:00.458 --> 31:02.327
We have
a Code White emergency in C5.

31:02.427 --> 31:05.163
Repeat, Code White emergency.

31:05.263 --> 31:06.664
It's a violent person
or a hostage;

31:06.764 --> 31:07.632
it triggers a lockdown.

31:07.732 --> 31:10.535
No one's
getting in or out...

31:10.635 --> 31:12.537
except in a body bag.

31:12.637 --> 31:14.239
Please, look...

31:14.339 --> 31:16.007
Whatever it is
you're upset about--

31:16.107 --> 31:17.242
What I'm upset about?

31:17.342 --> 31:20.078
My father, Damon.

31:20.178 --> 31:22.080
Derek?
We know that's your real name.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.048
We've called the police.
They're on their way.

31:24.148 --> 31:25.316
Well, they're
gonna be delayed

31:25.416 --> 31:27.518
thanks to your friend
and his credentials.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.587
- What is that?
- No, no, no, no, no!

31:29.687 --> 31:32.290
Hospital-grade fentanyl.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.058
It won't kill him immediately.

31:34.158 --> 31:37.528
Just long enough for him
to feel completely powerless.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.031
Derek, it's over.

31:40.131 --> 31:41.799
The police are already
on the way, okay?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.268
There's no point
in doing any of this.

31:43.368 --> 31:44.702
Just hand it over to me.

31:44.802 --> 31:46.037
Come on, you don't have to.

31:46.137 --> 31:48.539
Please!
Please, please, please!

31:48.640 --> 31:49.774
No, Darby, no!

31:51.476 --> 31:53.111
Darby!

31:53.211 --> 31:53.945
Lucas!

31:54.045 --> 31:55.079
Gah!
Ah!

31:55.179 --> 31:58.449
Oh my God!
Why did you do that?

31:58.549 --> 31:59.884
Hey, whoa, okay, careful!

31:59.984 --> 32:01.452
Oh...

32:01.552 --> 32:02.787
Look at me.
Lucas!

32:04.422 --> 32:06.124
- Help, we need help in here!
- Mom!

32:06.224 --> 32:08.626
Help, please!

32:09.827 --> 32:09.861
ea

32:09.861 --> 32:09.894
ease

32:09.894 --> 32:09.928
ease,

32:09.928 --> 32:09.961
ease, mo

32:09.961 --> 32:09.994
ease, move

32:09.994 --> 32:10.028
ease, move!

32:12.330 --> 32:13.765
I need you to move!
Excuse me...

32:13.865 --> 32:16.267
Please proceed
to your designated safety zone.

32:16.367 --> 32:18.369
If you are unable to
reach your safety zone,

32:18.469 --> 32:20.471
please remain where you are
until the lockdown is over.

32:20.571 --> 32:22.340
Move, move!
Hey!

32:29.213 --> 32:31.849
Hey, I need someone
to open this door, stat!

32:31.950 --> 32:34.218
Tell me what to do.
What do I do?

32:34.319 --> 32:35.687
Oh...

32:35.787 --> 32:37.555
The danger
is respiratory failure.

32:37.655 --> 32:38.790
Okay, is there naloxone in here?

32:38.890 --> 32:40.091
I can look.

32:40.191 --> 32:42.660
Oh, no, there's...
It's okay.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.662
You hate needles.

32:46.364 --> 32:47.832
Okay, you're breathing,
you're conscious.

32:47.932 --> 32:49.434
What's next?
What's next?

32:49.534 --> 32:52.603
Tell me what to do next.

32:52.704 --> 32:54.205
The defib.

32:54.305 --> 32:56.040
What?

32:56.140 --> 32:57.942
Oh, no!

32:59.243 --> 33:01.746
No, no, no, listen to me,
listen to me.

33:01.846 --> 33:04.215
- I can pay you--
- Shut... up!

33:04.315 --> 33:05.717
Let's calm down.

33:05.817 --> 33:09.487
We want to help you get
through this situation, Derek.

33:09.587 --> 33:11.089
I don't need help.

33:11.189 --> 33:14.392
Just one shock can put him
into cardiac arrest.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.294
Please, please!

33:16.394 --> 33:18.096
Just stop talking!

33:18.196 --> 33:20.098
If you do this,
you're charged with murder.

33:20.198 --> 33:21.766
Your life is over.

33:21.866 --> 33:24.135
But it will have been
worth something.

33:25.937 --> 33:29.440
You don't remember
my father, Damon?

33:32.377 --> 33:34.879
He was your driver.

33:34.979 --> 33:36.647
You got a DUI
and couldn't drive,

33:36.748 --> 33:39.450
but one night you bullied him

33:39.550 --> 33:41.819
into giving you
the keys to the car.

33:41.919 --> 33:45.123
And he took it,
and he got into a collision

33:45.223 --> 33:47.658
and he fled the scene,
and your dad was liable

33:47.759 --> 33:51.396
because he loaned him the car?

33:51.496 --> 33:53.464
Yeah.
You let him take the fall.

33:53.564 --> 33:54.732
I'm sorry!

33:54.832 --> 33:57.135
My father killed himself
because he was worried

33:57.235 --> 33:59.670
my mother would lose the house!

33:59.771 --> 34:04.042
He thought his life was worth
less than an insurance policy!

34:04.142 --> 34:05.343
I'm so sorry!

34:05.443 --> 34:08.179
I'm sorry!

34:10.048 --> 34:12.216
No, don't do it!

34:12.316 --> 34:14.018
Lucas is in grave danger!

34:14.118 --> 34:17.755
And killing Alex is not
gonna bring your dad back.

34:24.462 --> 34:26.130
No.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.066
But he has to pay!

34:28.166 --> 34:33.004
For all the suffering
that he's caused!

34:33.104 --> 34:34.439
Ow!

34:34.539 --> 34:37.208
Okay, yeah, too much shoulder.

34:37.308 --> 34:39.310
Ow...

34:39.410 --> 34:40.445
Oh, finally!

34:40.545 --> 34:42.814
- Thank you!
- Oh, no, it's okay.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.749
- Gah!
- Wait!

34:44.849 --> 34:46.484
Alex has destroyed
so many lives,

34:46.584 --> 34:50.221
but you don't
have to let him ruin yours.

34:50.321 --> 34:51.289
It's too late.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.091
No, no!

34:53.191 --> 34:54.225
Clear!

35:00.665 --> 35:03.901
Just stop, Derek.
It's over.

35:07.004 --> 35:08.873
Don't move!

35:08.973 --> 35:10.775
No... I...

35:10.875 --> 35:11.943
Go, go!

35:12.043 --> 35:14.879
Lucas!
Lucas! Help!

35:17.949 --> 35:20.251
Look at me!
Lucas!

35:25.356 --> 35:27.225
One, two, three.

35:27.325 --> 35:29.026
One, two, and three!

35:29.127 --> 35:31.562
Do you feel a pulse?
Check the vitals!

35:44.976 --> 35:47.378
Well, I certainly hope

35:47.478 --> 35:49.847
that young man
gets the help he needs.

35:49.947 --> 35:53.618
Well, he'll have a psych eval
coupled with his treatment plan.

35:53.718 --> 35:55.219
And when we do charge him,

35:55.319 --> 35:57.455
Alex Larson actually asked
we show him some leniency.

35:57.555 --> 35:58.856
- Oh!
- Mm-hm.

35:58.956 --> 35:59.991
That's interesting!

36:00.091 --> 36:02.226
Seems that Alex
finally learned something.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.361
Hmm!

36:03.461 --> 36:04.495
How about you?

36:04.595 --> 36:07.398
Well, I...
maybe, probably,

36:07.498 --> 36:08.533
got a little overexcited

36:08.633 --> 36:10.701
at the prospect of
arresting a Hollywood star.

36:10.801 --> 36:13.004
Hmm, and you will be extending

36:13.104 --> 36:16.407
a very public apology
to Candace Buchanan?

36:16.507 --> 36:18.042
Hmm, that...

36:18.142 --> 36:21.045
will definitely be happening.

36:21.145 --> 36:23.481
- Ugh...
- Thank you.

36:36.894 --> 36:38.963
You doing okay?

36:39.063 --> 36:42.200
Yeah, I think so.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.368
Thanks.

36:44.468 --> 36:47.505
Yeah.

36:47.605 --> 36:49.874
Zane?

36:52.810 --> 36:56.681
I'm sorry if you think
I'm not interested in your life.

36:56.781 --> 36:57.949
I am.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.885
You and your family
are really important to me.

37:03.921 --> 37:05.289
Okay.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.767
Darby!
Thanks for calling.

37:16.867 --> 37:18.436
How's Lucas?
Where is he?

37:18.536 --> 37:19.370
He's here.

37:19.470 --> 37:21.172
Oh my God, Lucas!

37:21.272 --> 37:23.107
Hey... I'm okay.

37:23.207 --> 37:25.576
I'm okay.

37:27.979 --> 37:30.281
It's because of you, Darby.

37:30.381 --> 37:31.816
Thank you.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.751
You saved me.

37:39.657 --> 37:41.926
I'll see you soon!

38:03.047 --> 38:04.882
It's like you wouldn't
buy this for the house,

38:04.982 --> 38:06.684
you know?
That's why it's such a delight

38:06.784 --> 38:07.818
to have these at a workplace.

38:07.918 --> 38:10.254
Thank you!

38:10.354 --> 38:12.323
They want to do
a cover story on me

38:12.423 --> 38:13.391
for "The Hollywood Reporter"!

38:13.491 --> 38:14.925
- Wow!
- I'm coming back, Vic!

38:15.026 --> 38:16.193
You deserve it.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.229
And I hear they've
reworked the script?

38:18.329 --> 38:19.964
Yeah, Alex is
taking a step back,

38:20.064 --> 38:21.766
and we're just gonna
shoot out the scenes here

38:21.866 --> 38:23.501
while Nadine gets
the script rewritten

38:23.601 --> 38:25.169
to make me the main character!

38:25.269 --> 38:26.170
Unbelievable.

38:26.270 --> 38:27.872
Maybe it'll make more sense too.

38:27.972 --> 38:28.873
Mm-hm...

38:28.973 --> 38:32.343
I am just so, so grateful
to you both.

38:32.443 --> 38:34.412
You really got me
out of a bad place.

38:34.512 --> 38:36.180
I've always believed in you, Candace.

38:36.280 --> 38:37.348
It's true.
She has.

38:37.448 --> 38:40.017
And Mom's a great person
to have in your corner.

38:40.117 --> 38:41.719
She sure is.

38:41.819 --> 38:42.820
Ms. Buchanan?

38:42.920 --> 38:45.022
- They're ready for you on set.
- Oh!

38:45.122 --> 38:46.524
Oh, you gotta go.

38:46.624 --> 38:47.992
So nice to see you!

38:48.092 --> 38:50.561
- You too.
- Bye.

38:50.661 --> 38:52.596
You'll come for dinner at
the house sometime soon, right?

38:52.697 --> 38:55.032
Oh, love to!
Thanks.

38:55.132 --> 38:56.934
- What's this?
- A memento.

38:57.034 --> 38:59.270
And a promise...

38:59.370 --> 39:01.605
that I will quit for good.

39:01.706 --> 39:05.810
And Darby, I had production send
a little something to the house.

39:05.910 --> 39:07.745
Open it when you're alone.

39:10.114 --> 39:11.349
Okay!

39:35.439 --> 39:38.409
"Dear Darby, the next
few months will be tough

39:38.509 --> 39:40.444
"while your mom's gone
on her book tour,

39:40.544 --> 39:42.980
"but maybe reading the book
that started it all

39:43.080 --> 39:44.882
"will make her feel closer.

39:44.982 --> 39:47.818
"Bryn's story
is Victoria's story.

39:47.918 --> 39:50.388
"I hope you'll love it
as millions do.

39:50.488 --> 39:52.757
"Fondly, Candace Buchanan."

39:55.493 --> 39:57.128
Book tour?

40:01.065 --> 40:02.833
Ugh...

40:16.247 --> 40:17.982
Billy?

40:20.217 --> 40:22.453
I hear you're
going on a book tour.

40:22.553 --> 40:24.488
- I--
- Were you gonna tell me?

40:24.588 --> 40:26.924
And you've got Alastair
digging up dirt on Billy

40:27.024 --> 40:28.526
just 'cause
you can't stand the fact

40:28.626 --> 40:30.127
that I am finally happy?

40:30.227 --> 40:32.997
What?
Of course not!

40:33.097 --> 40:35.366
I told him to call off
that stupid investigation,

40:35.466 --> 40:38.969
thank you very much.
But this is happening, isn't it?

40:39.069 --> 40:41.338
- I just-- I--
- Yes or no?

40:41.439 --> 40:43.908
Ugh!

40:44.008 --> 40:46.710
Just when I start trusting you
and letting you in again,

40:46.811 --> 40:47.778
you ditch me.

40:47.878 --> 40:49.013
- For her.
- Who?

40:49.113 --> 40:50.714
Bryn Martell!

40:50.815 --> 40:52.483
Your favourite child.

40:52.583 --> 40:56.320
You'd rather travel the world
as a famous author, with her,

40:56.420 --> 40:57.888
than be here with me.

40:57.988 --> 40:59.857
What are you talking about?

40:59.957 --> 41:03.427
When your father died, I had
to do something to support us!

41:03.527 --> 41:06.297
Supporting us
has always been an excuse, Mom.

41:06.397 --> 41:07.531
Admit it.

41:07.631 --> 41:10.601
You just wanted to do
whatever you wanted to do.

41:10.701 --> 41:13.737
Oh, you love to rewrite history.

41:13.838 --> 41:15.606
I tried to be there for you.

41:15.706 --> 41:19.043
When you graduated from
university, the police academy.

41:19.143 --> 41:22.546
But you, you refused to see me!

41:22.646 --> 41:24.849
This is so classic.

41:24.949 --> 41:27.117
Poor Victoria.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.786
You're just like your father.

41:28.886 --> 41:31.055
What does that mean?

41:31.155 --> 41:33.491
You undermine me.
You don't trust my judgement.

41:33.591 --> 41:34.792
You clip my wings.

41:34.892 --> 41:37.895
That is Sam,
through and through.

41:37.995 --> 41:39.396
No, it's not.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.766
Dad was the nice one.
He was reliable.

41:42.867 --> 41:45.236
Oh, you're so proud
of your hero,

41:45.336 --> 41:48.239
who told me that I couldn't
have my own career,

41:48.339 --> 41:51.775
who told me it was stupid
for me to want to be an author,

41:51.876 --> 41:54.712
to have ambition,
to have a dream!

41:54.812 --> 41:57.982
He wasn't like that. No.

41:58.082 --> 42:01.418
I was the one
that was married to him!

42:01.519 --> 42:03.153
I put it all in here.

42:03.254 --> 42:04.622
What are you talking about?

42:04.722 --> 42:06.924
If you want to know
the truth about your father,

42:07.024 --> 42:08.893
catch up with
the rest of the world!

42:08.993 --> 42:11.662
If he hadn't died,
I would have left him.

42:15.432 --> 42:18.068
I'm done.
