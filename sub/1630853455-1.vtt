JAHSEH ONFROY:
Okay, guys, so here is my first vlog.

00:18.185 --> 00:21.980
Today, I am basically going
to tell you guys about myself

00:21.980 --> 00:23.732
because I've never really let you in much,

00:23.732 --> 00:26.443
and I feel like that's
the best thing to do right now

00:26.443 --> 00:28.612

00:28.612 --> 00:30.113
So, here's my room.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.366
Uh, here's Stitch.

This is my favorite
Disney character, ever.

He's very relatable.

00:39.665 --> 00:40.666
So...

00:41.750 --> 00:43.377
today I am basically going

00:43.377 --> 00:45.462
to be telling you guys about myself.

00:48.799 --> 00:52.135
Uh, currently, I'm in
a huge state of paranoia,

00:52.135 --> 00:56.598
um, just due to m-my past

00:56.598 --> 00:57.933
and just the things and the people

00:57.933 --> 01:00.769
I've associated myself with previously.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.689
I've tried to put myself in a position

01:03.689 --> 01:07.484
to ideally be able
to motivate others to--

01:08.235 --> 01:09.695
I mean, for myself to suffice,

01:09.695 --> 01:11.071

01:11.071 --> 01:12.447
'cause, like, bro, this shit--

01:12.447 --> 01:15.033
It's, like, trying to consume me.
It's almost like it's...

01:16.201 --> 01:18.620
like it's trying to get inside
of my mind, you know?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.790
I apologize for being so distant.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.792
I've been paranoid.
I've been needing help,

01:23.792 --> 01:26.587

01:26.587 --> 01:28.380

And so, as an incentive, I offered to,

11:42.536 --> 11:44.872
"You don't have to get straight A's.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.499

Don't get into any problems."

I was at least 16.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.003
I think he was younger
than me at the time.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.422
And he told me his charges,

we would be beatbox, like, making beats

13:41.446 --> 13:43.574
at the same time to each other.

13:43.574 --> 13:45.742
We didn't even know what
we wanted to do at the time.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.120
We just know we wanted
to make a stand for who we are

13:48.120 --> 13:49.997

13:49.997 --> 13:51.707

Back then, we were stealing shit.

Well, I was... [clears throat]

14:12.853 --> 14:14.563
I was stealing cough syrup and selling it.

14:14.563 --> 14:16.982
We were just had a lot
of drugs really back then,

14:16.982 --> 14:19.151
and we found a lot of ways to make money,

14:19.151 --> 14:21.612
but because our parents wasn't
helping us with nothing really

14:21.612 --> 14:24.656
because they just thought we were
fucking horrible kids at the time.

14:25.282 --> 14:28.160
I remember Cleo's mom picking
me and Jahseh up one day,

14:28.160 --> 14:30.287
and this is the first time
I meet the lady,

14:30.287 --> 14:32.581
and she says, "Why're you
hanging out with him?

14:32.581 --> 14:34.708
He's a bad kid." [laughs]

14:34.708 --> 14:36.585
This is what she tells me,
"He's a bad kid.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.712
Why are you,
why are you chilling with this boy?"

14:42.883 --> 14:45.219
I feel like a lot of times
Jahseh did feel like

14:45.219 --> 14:47.513
even his family didn't really
like him at that point.

14:48.764 --> 14:51.141
He didn't understand
how his family treated him,

14:51.141 --> 14:52.601
like he was just this bad child.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.728
But if you think in Jah's mind back then,

14:54.728 --> 14:55.896
Jah didn't think that he was just

14:55.896 --> 14:58.065
this bad child trying to rebel.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.609
Jah thinks he's just being Jah.
You know what I mean?

15:00.609 --> 15:02.778
Like, I'm just being me
and niggas hate me,

15:02.778 --> 15:04.780
and I hate myself 'cause niggas hate me,

15:04.780 --> 15:06.782
and I need to change myself, basically.

15:09.201 --> 15:10.786
I've seen him literally choose

15:10.786 --> 15:13.664
to sleep on the streets
more times than go home.

15:13.664 --> 15:15.499
He didn't explain it to me all the time,

15:15.499 --> 15:17.709
but I just knew he even felt better

15:17.709 --> 15:19.294
sleeping with me in the car.

15:22.381 --> 15:24.091
- When he left home,

15:24.091 --> 15:26.260
he left home, nobody kicked him out.

15:26.260 --> 15:28.804
And it was as a result of him
not wanting to follow the rules,

15:28.804 --> 15:30.848
or not follow curfew,

15:30.848 --> 15:34.184
or just doing whatever he wanted to do.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.894
- And then he just
stopped going to school.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.939
He just was like, "Yo, good."

15:51.118 --> 15:52.452

15:54.830 --> 15:56.832
'til the wheels fell off, and then, um,

15:56.832 --> 15:59.042
out of nowhere, Jah wanted
to make his own group, too.

16:13.599 --> 16:15.726
There was really
no, like, planned creation.

16:15.726 --> 16:17.686
It was, kind of, just like a manifestation

16:17.686 --> 16:19.271
type of thing for him, you know?

16:19.271 --> 16:20.939
And it was, kind of, like a brotherhood.

KILO JUNIOR: Mostly everybody
would come to my house

16:23.358 --> 16:25.444

and we would just, like,

sit back there and smoke,
and write lyrics,

16:33.827 --> 16:35.495

microphones you could get,

16:35.495 --> 16:37.706

16:38.123 --> 16:40.292
We were recording in bedrooms,

16:42.961 --> 16:44.546
It doesn't matter what it was,

16:44.546 --> 16:47.049
he would pull that little thing
out with the three prongs

16:47.049 --> 16:49.009
and we would just record that shit.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.346
And that's why our music
came with distortion

16:52.346 --> 16:53.931
because the type of mic
that we were using,

16:53.931 --> 16:55.766
but we would use it
to our advantage, really.

21:26.662 --> 21:28.205
you know, I decided that I wanted

21:28.205 --> 21:30.624
to manage some of these artists
because I saw a lot of potential.

21:30.624 --> 21:32.835
But, you know, I was going
to a lot of the shows,

21:32.835 --> 21:34.503
and there was one guy that was starting

21:34.503 --> 21:35.629
to make a little noise in South Florida.

21:35.629 --> 21:36.672
I didn't know who he was.

21:36.672 --> 21:38.090
And everybody around me's
like, he's the kid

21:38.090 --> 21:39.466
we were telling you about, X.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.260
You know, he's, like,
coming up in the scene.

21:41.260 --> 21:43.595
- We weren't on the level that he was on.

21:43.595 --> 21:45.556
It was him and Ski on a particular level,

21:45.556 --> 21:49.351
and it was our job to help
that grow and formulate.

21:49.351 --> 21:52.563
He started off by networking with artists

21:52.563 --> 21:54.857
that was already running the
South Florida underground scene.

21:54.857 --> 21:57.818
WiFi was one of those people
that already was up there.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.696
Robb was another one.
He was already up there.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.614
Denzel.

22:04.324 --> 22:07.703
- I just saw his energy.
Like, it's hard to explain.

22:07.703 --> 22:09.872
Like, just his presence.
Like, he could make noise

22:09.872 --> 22:11.123
in the room and not even speak.

22:12.082 --> 22:15.335
These kids, man, they looked like
they were ready to die for Jah.

22:16.044 --> 22:17.921
He was already XXXTentacion.

22:17.921 --> 22:19.840
The way he got that name he came up with,

22:19.840 --> 22:22.968
that name was his, uh, you know,
infatuation with porn.

22:22.968 --> 22:26.096
So, once he heard,
oh, there's this porn star

22:26.096 --> 22:27.890
that shoots porn with underground artists,

22:27.890 --> 22:29.892
he's like, "Oh, this is
the guy I got to meet."

22:30.893 --> 22:32.519
I think he was living with his grandma.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.897
He started coming over more
than he was supposed to.

22:35.939 --> 22:38.358
So, I was like, "You coming here a lot."

22:38.358 --> 22:40.110
I wake up in the morning,
he's sleeping on the couch.

22:40.110 --> 22:41.820
I'm like, "Hey, man,
y-you don't live here."

22:41.820 --> 22:43.113
He's like, "Bro,

22:43.113 --> 22:45.657
where I'm at, man, I'm going crazy."

22:45.657 --> 22:47.951
Like, "I need to,
I need to be somewhere else.

22:47.951 --> 22:49.661
Like, please let me move in."

22:49.661 --> 22:51.955
I was like, "All right,
I'll officially be your manager.

22:51.955 --> 22:53.165
You can move in."

22:53.165 --> 22:54.750

When he was able to stay at Bruno's,

23:03.467 --> 23:06.386
I think he was able to hone in
on his artistry,

23:06.386 --> 23:09.097

23:34.623 --> 23:36.792

started picking up for him

and show him that I'm going

how to control that.

It took a series of things
for Jah to get the way he was.

to study his timetables,

40:08.700 --> 40:10.160
when I met Jahseh.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.746
I was at the time dating Khaed Moulton,

40:12.746 --> 40:14.414
which was his producer.

40:14.414 --> 40:16.917
Jahseh was about 18 at the time.

40:16.917 --> 40:18.544
Jahseh was not a monster.

40:18.544 --> 40:20.254
Like, when I met him,
he was very charming,

40:20.254 --> 40:21.630
very intelligent,

40:21.630 --> 40:23.090
empathetic, in a sense.

40:23.090 --> 40:25.259
Like, damn near surprised me.

40:27.845 --> 40:30.430
The first day I saw Geneva
when she came out,

40:30.430 --> 40:32.140
she was wearing a hoodie.

40:32.140 --> 40:34.268
She just wasn't making
eye contact with anybody.

40:34.268 --> 40:36.436
She'd look up and just,
like, go back down.

40:36.436 --> 40:38.772
She was literally just
a shell of a person.

40:38.772 --> 40:41.024
Like, there was just no expression.

40:41.024 --> 40:42.067
There was nothing.

40:42.609 --> 40:45.153
I felt like her soul
was empty at the time.

40:45.153 --> 40:46.154
You know?

40:50.075 --> 40:53.078
One day, Khaed cracked a joke in the car.

40:53.078 --> 40:54.329
She kind of giggled and laughed.

40:55.289 --> 40:58.333
And Jahseh, like, cut his eyes
to her and was like,

40:58.333 --> 41:00.127
when we get to the house, go in the room.

41:00.711 --> 41:02.921
And I was kind of like, "What the fuck?"

41:02.921 --> 41:05.757
It kind of became clear
that he was not happy

41:05.757 --> 41:07.384
with her laughing at his joke.

41:08.927 --> 41:11.180
They went in the room,
and I could hear them fighting.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.515
Eventually, you just hear somebody

41:13.515 --> 41:15.225
who's getting hit.

41:15.225 --> 41:17.686
Jahseh had a bathroom in that,
a private bathroom in the room.

41:18.312 --> 41:20.689
So, you could hear water running
and I'm thinking,

41:20.689 --> 41:22.691
"Okay, maybe they're going
to take a shower or whatever."

41:22.691 --> 41:24.276
But no.

41:25.444 --> 41:27.529
He was literally drowning her in the tub,

41:27.529 --> 41:29.698
like putting her under,
and you could hear her screams

41:29.698 --> 41:31.783
being muffled by the water
and being put up

41:31.783 --> 41:33.535
and then being put back under the water.

41:33.535 --> 41:36.371
And I was banging on the door,
begging Khaed like,

41:36.371 --> 41:38.415
"Bro, I'm calling the cops,"
and he's begging me,

41:38.415 --> 41:39.750
"Don't call the cops, bro."

41:39.750 --> 41:41.460
Like, you know
I got a situation in Georgia,

41:41.460 --> 41:42.669
which he did.

41:42.669 --> 41:44.796
So, I didn't. Big regret.

41:45.881 --> 41:48.383
Later that night,
she finally came out again

41:48.383 --> 41:49.968
and she, like, picked up her hoodie

41:49.968 --> 41:51.762
and she was marked up with bruises

41:51.762 --> 41:54.389
like a Dalmatian,
like a bruise behind her ear,

41:54.890 --> 41:56.934
behind her neck, literally everywhere.

41:56.934 --> 42:00.062
And it was very clear that
he was avoiding hitting her face

42:00.062 --> 42:02.606
so that she wouldn't have
any, like, clear injuries

42:02.606 --> 42:04.066
when you were talking to her.

42:04.066 --> 42:06.151
I've never seen somebody
bruised up so bad.

42:08.862 --> 42:11.114
It was just very clear like
she didn't have nobody.

42:11.114 --> 42:12.533
Like, she didn't have any money,

42:12.533 --> 42:14.451
she didn't have any family support.

42:14.451 --> 42:16.995
So, in a situation like that,
when people are like,

42:16.995 --> 42:18.830
"Why don't you leave,
why don't you leave?"

42:18.830 --> 42:21.208
And you really don't,
you think that that person

42:21.208 --> 42:24.127
is literally your foundation
and your network to life.

43:07.462 --> 43:09.173
TALYSSA:
They all knew what was going on,

43:09.173 --> 43:11.967
and they were so caught up in his clout

43:11.967 --> 43:14.052
and having his respect,

43:14.052 --> 43:15.929
they would never go against
what he was saying.

43:16.471 --> 43:18.765
It was like the weight of that person,

43:18.765 --> 43:21.393
it was zero compared to their potential

43:21.393 --> 43:23.020
to make it with Jahseh.

43:23.020 --> 43:25.814
So, there was just
no incentive to step in.

43:28.734 --> 43:30.319
COOLIECUT: You know how
you got that little voice in your head

43:30.319 --> 43:31.695
and it'd be like, "Yo, don't do that."

43:32.237 --> 43:33.655
I don't think he had that

43:33.655 --> 43:35.616
in certain moments,
if you get what I'm saying.

43:35.616 --> 43:37.242
So, he used to just be like,
"Bro, niggas tryin' me.

43:37.242 --> 43:39.161
All right, let's go." You feel me?

43:39.161 --> 43:41.288
That-- So, if you don't have
that in your head,

43:41.288 --> 43:43.290
you kind of got to have
somebody around you

43:43.290 --> 43:45.584
to be like, "Yo, bro, we good, bro.

43:45.584 --> 43:48.337
It's not that big of a deal."
You feel me? Let's just vibe."

43:48.337 --> 43:50.005
And I don't think, that was the thing,

43:50.005 --> 43:52.299
I don't really think
he had that in Orlando.

44:02.601 --> 44:05.938
- He was in jail and I was
with a group of his friends.

44:05.938 --> 44:07.981
You know, they were, like,
taking care of me and stuff

44:07.981 --> 44:09.733
while, until he got back.

44:11.151 --> 44:14.613
And I ended up cheating
on Jahseh with his homeboy.

44:18.825 --> 44:20.452
Once it came out, like,

44:21.119 --> 44:23.247
Jahseh at first said
that he would deal with it

44:23.247 --> 44:24.623
and he would get over it.

44:24.623 --> 44:28.544
But he couldn't get over it, it seemed.

44:34.883 --> 44:36.802
BRUNO:
He did come to me and was like,

44:36.802 --> 44:38.679
"Hey, Geneva's pregnant, what do I do?"

44:39.263 --> 44:41.765
And I couldn't really answer
that question.

44:43.100 --> 44:44.476
I don't know, I was like, "Oh.

44:45.686 --> 44:47.437
Just be there for her, that's it."

44:48.146 --> 44:50.357
You know? But it can't be here.

44:51.191 --> 44:52.568
Especially now that she's pregnant.

45:04.746 --> 45:07.124
TALYSSA: If I was there, I don't think
it would have went that far.

45:08.125 --> 45:10.085
I don't think I would have
left Geneva alone

45:10.085 --> 45:11.378
for a second with him,

45:11.378 --> 45:13.005
and that's what happened
when she was attacked,

45:13.005 --> 45:14.173
she was left alone.

45:21.638 --> 45:23.098
From what I understand, like,

45:23.098 --> 45:25.058
they held her there
for, like, three or four days

45:25.058 --> 45:26.810
and wouldn't let her see the hospital.

45:27.895 --> 45:29.730
I remember when she said how she escaped,

45:29.730 --> 45:31.899
'cause I was like, "How the fuck
did you get out of that shit?"

45:34.026 --> 45:36.778
He was playing PlayStation
or Xbox or something,

45:36.778 --> 45:38.530
and she opened up the fridge

45:38.530 --> 45:40.699
and kind of let that be a distraction,

45:40.699 --> 45:42.492
like she was looking in the fridge,

45:42.492 --> 45:44.745
and she says she got on her, her fours

45:44.745 --> 45:47.539
and crawled out of the house
while the fridge was still open

45:47.539 --> 45:48.624
and ran out.

45:53.962 --> 45:55.881
GENEVA:
I had nowhere to run.

45:55.881 --> 45:59.301
I don't have any brothers,
I don't have a father figure.

45:59.301 --> 46:00.677
Nobody was going to come save me.

46:00.677 --> 46:02.804
I had to leave.

46:02.804 --> 46:04.723
I felt like it was going to get worse.

46:05.557 --> 46:10.062
The first person I called
when I ran away from the house

46:10.062 --> 46:12.814
was my ex-boyfriend because
literally besides my mom,

46:12.814 --> 46:15.025
that was like the only
phone number I knew by heart.

46:15.025 --> 46:16.902
And he seen my face and he's like,

46:16.902 --> 46:19.112
"Okay, this is crazy.
I have to call my mom."

46:19.821 --> 46:22.157
His mother was like,
"She can't be with you

46:22.157 --> 46:23.992
because they're going
to think you did that."

46:24.952 --> 46:27.287
She literally drove me to the station.

46:27.287 --> 46:29.998
She was like, "Go, 'cause you're
not staying with us like that."

46:31.750 --> 46:33.377
I didn't want nobody to go to jail,

46:33.377 --> 46:35.379
but I didn't know what to do.

46:36.380 --> 46:38.632
I wasn't aware that that would
all, like, crumble down

46:38.632 --> 46:39.842
onto him like that.

46:46.473 --> 46:48.350
DEANDRA:
You got to be fucking kidding me.

46:48.350 --> 46:49.601
Like, that's the first thing
I thought, like,

46:49.601 --> 46:51.395
"You got to be fucking kidding me."

46:51.395 --> 46:54.356
Like, how... how... [stammers]

46:54.356 --> 46:55.691
Like, you just gotta
be fucking kidding me.

46:55.691 --> 46:57.651
Like, there was no other way
to think about it.

46:58.902 --> 47:01.572
- You know, I knew he was a lot of things
and get into a lot of shit,

47:01.572 --> 47:03.240
but that, that was new to me.

47:04.074 --> 47:05.659
That part was foreign to me.

47:07.703 --> 47:10.289
I was shocked at how bad it was.

47:27.973 --> 47:30.976
He was already out on bond
when that incident happened.

47:31.727 --> 47:33.353
He had racked up so many points that,

47:33.353 --> 47:36.023
you know, he was going to jail
for a very long time.

47:38.358 --> 47:39.860
DEANDRA:
Cleo, in her mind was like,

47:39.860 --> 47:41.236
I'm going to have to take care
of him his whole life

47:41.236 --> 47:43.864
because he has a record,
tattoos on his face.

47:43.864 --> 47:46.200
Like, it was exhausting. just running,

47:46.200 --> 47:48.785
like, not knowing what
the next option was for him.

47:56.084 --> 47:57.836
- When he called me, I was really nervous.

47:57.836 --> 48:00.088
I was like, "Okay,
this is a jail phone call."

48:00.672 --> 48:01.798
I answer it.

48:16.063 --> 48:17.981
GENEVA: He was telling me
that I would go to jail,

48:17.981 --> 48:19.316
and I was scared of that.

48:19.316 --> 48:21.818
But then he would tell me that he loved me

48:22.444 --> 48:24.821
and that he cared about me,
he didn't want anything to happen to me.

48:24.821 --> 48:26.573
So, there was still, like,
a little bit of manipulation

48:26.573 --> 48:28.450
and I was just, like, so confused.

48:45.259 --> 48:46.969
GENEVA: The fact that he got
in the amount of trouble

48:46.969 --> 48:49.805
that he did get into,
it was not my intention.

48:50.347 --> 48:51.890
I just needed to get away from it.

48:52.850 --> 48:54.685
BASS:
Of course, we believe him.

48:54.685 --> 48:55.894
- We're family.

48:55.894 --> 48:57.396
We hate to see one of our own

48:57.396 --> 48:59.439
be incarcerated, you know,

48:59.439 --> 49:01.191
especially for an allegation.

49:01.191 --> 49:04.570
You know? And he's literally
sitting rotting in jail

49:04.570 --> 49:06.488
- for an allegation--
KILO: Almost a year.

49:06.488 --> 49:07.739
- That shit felt forever.

49:07.739 --> 49:09.575
- Everybody was like,

49:09.575 --> 49:11.910
"He was arrested
because of his girlfriend."

49:11.910 --> 49:13.662
And I'm like, "Well, this is why."

49:15.664 --> 49:18.876
When I told my piece about the situation,

49:18.876 --> 49:20.669
fans are not very understanding

49:20.669 --> 49:22.921
because obviously the person
that they look up to

49:22.921 --> 49:25.841
is saying one thing, and then I was saying
the complete opposite.

49:25.841 --> 49:27.885
Obviously, they're not going
to believe me.

49:32.306 --> 49:34.933
FLYBOY: The fans are toxic,
so if they get an ear of things,

49:34.933 --> 49:36.560
they're going to start

49:36.560 --> 49:38.103
making up their own narratives

49:38.103 --> 49:40.355
and start twisting things
and contorting it.

49:40.355 --> 49:43.150
And so now, it's this on social media.

49:44.151 --> 49:47.654
Whether he did it or not,
for people to make it public,

49:47.654 --> 49:50.199
all that shit brings
attention towards him.

49:51.950 --> 49:54.536
- I want to say it was,
we were on Instagram

49:54.536 --> 49:56.580
and A$AP Rocky was like,

49:56.580 --> 49:58.248
"Yo, free X,

49:58.248 --> 49:59.958
that's the hottest nigga out
of Florida right now," right?

49:59.958 --> 50:02.044
- Free my nigga XXX.

50:02.044 --> 50:03.378
I can't wait 'til you come home.

50:03.378 --> 50:04.713
Fuck is you talking 'bout?

50:04.713 --> 50:06.590
He the hardest nigga in Florida.

50:06.590 --> 50:07.841
I said it. So what--

50:07.841 --> 50:09.843
- It would literally
become like a hashtag,

50:09.843 --> 50:12.846
like his mug shot went viral.

50:12.846 --> 50:15.557
- The first image I ever saw
of Jahseh was his mug shot,

50:15.557 --> 50:19.228
and it was probably the most
polarizing image of an artist

50:19.228 --> 50:21.230
that I've ever seen in my life.

50:21.230 --> 50:24.816
He had tattoos on his face.
Half blond, half black hair.

50:24.816 --> 50:26.818
He had the stare in his eyes.

50:26.818 --> 50:28.612
His eyes almost looked black.

50:28.612 --> 50:31.698
His image, it was exciting,
it was polarizing.

50:31.698 --> 50:33.659
I knew that people wouldn't forget him

50:33.659 --> 50:35.953
because he was the first of his kind.

CLEOPATRA:
Unfortunately, we're living in a world

50:45.379 --> 50:49.216
where drama and bullshit sells.

50:49.216 --> 50:51.093
And so as bad as that was,

50:51.093 --> 50:52.970
it helped to catapult him
to the next level

50:52.970 --> 50:54.555
because his name was everywhere.

50:54.555 --> 50:57.432
And then the Drake beef added to it.

50:58.475 --> 51:00.394
MAN: It was the fans
who started saying something

51:00.394 --> 51:01.687
about Drake stealing his flow.

51:01.687 --> 51:03.230
- That's how we found out
'cause of the fans.

51:03.230 --> 51:05.524
- Yeah the fans, the fans
were speaking out before us.

Once the fans started speaking,

51:18.829 --> 51:20.163
it all started speaking for itself.

51:21.832 --> 51:23.417
SOLOMON:
People were fighting about the music,

People were fighting about the charges,

51:26.420 --> 51:27.629
hating him for the charges.

51:27.629 --> 51:30.757
But, like, he was only getting
more famous by the day.

51:30.757 --> 51:32.801
Whether you loved it

CLEOPATRA: I had labels
started reaching out to me

51:54.656 --> 51:55.824
because he was locked up.

51:55.824 --> 51:58.577
Regardless of whether me and him
fought like cats and dogs,

51:58.577 --> 52:01.121
he knew that I always had
his best interests at heart.

52:01.121 --> 52:03.624
Who was he going to trust,
you know what I mean?

52:03.624 --> 52:06.668
I'm his mama.
So, he gave me power of attorney.

52:06.668 --> 52:09.630
You know, I was kind of like,
"Oh, we should sign, we should sign."

52:09.630 --> 52:12.508
He was like, "No, Mom, if we can
hold on and stay independent,

52:12.508 --> 52:14.551
that's where the real bag is."

52:14.551 --> 52:16.637
Seeing all the people
being screwed in the industry,

52:16.637 --> 52:19.139
he knew very well and from early

52:19.139 --> 52:22.726
that he wanted to own all his masters.

52:23.185 --> 52:25.604
He knew what the end game
and the end goal was.

52:26.772 --> 52:28.690
Solomon found us, actually.

52:28.690 --> 52:30.442
I was intrigued by that.

52:30.442 --> 52:32.945
- You know, I saw pictures
of him, of course.

52:32.945 --> 52:34.780
But, like, I don't know, in my mind, like,

52:34.780 --> 52:36.406
I was expecting him to be, like,

52:36.406 --> 52:38.408
like a giant almost when I saw him.

52:38.408 --> 52:41.370
And then when I saw him behind the glass,

52:41.370 --> 52:44.414
it was just kind of crazy
because he was a kid.

52:44.998 --> 52:48.126
All this craziness,
and then he's just a kid.

52:48.126 --> 52:50.128
Like, he had all the hope in the world

52:50.128 --> 52:52.005
and you could see he was vulnerable.

52:52.005 --> 52:53.924
So, at that point, I'm just like,
"Yo, no matter what,

52:53.924 --> 52:55.425
yo, I got this kid, I got him."

52:55.425 --> 52:57.594
- We got our first deal
while he was locked up.

52:58.512 --> 53:01.807
SOLOMON: We got the 100 grand
to license "Look at Me" to Empire,

53:01.807 --> 53:03.517
and it was off to the races from there.

53:12.359 --> 53:14.903
- No, I really didn't give
a fuck, to be honest.

53:14.903 --> 53:16.655
That wasn't a concern to me.

53:16.655 --> 53:19.533
Uh, I just knew that
the record was special.

53:19.533 --> 53:21.076
It was moving,

53:21.076 --> 53:24.162
and I just started chasing it.

53:24.162 --> 53:26.623
I think my first contact with him was,

53:26.623 --> 53:30.169
uh, Bob called me on three-way
with him in prison,

53:30.878 --> 53:33.130
and we talked for a couple minutes

53:33.130 --> 53:34.882
and he told me had a couple other deals

53:34.882 --> 53:36.633
that he was looking at,
so on and so forth.

53:36.633 --> 53:40.262
And he called me back
with Bob on the phone,

53:40.262 --> 53:41.930
and he said, "I'm gonna do your deal."

53:41.930 --> 53:44.474
And I said, "I don't understand.

53:44.474 --> 53:47.060
Why would you do our deal
versus the other deal?"

53:47.060 --> 53:49.646
Um, and mind you, the other deal was

53:49.646 --> 53:54.359
like a traditional
multi-album deal, large advance.

53:54.359 --> 53:57.154
I think the advance was like
1.5 million, he told me.

53:57.154 --> 53:59.698
My offer was like a 100k
for, like, two singles.

54:00.616 --> 54:03.243
Um, and I asked him, I said,

54:03.243 --> 54:05.996
"Why would you do my deal
over the other deal?

54:07.539 --> 54:10.125
You're only like 18, bro.
That's a lot of money."

54:10.125 --> 54:11.752
He said, "'Cause your deal
makes me a partner

54:11.752 --> 54:13.128
and their deal makes me a slave."

I was waiting for them in the studio

and, um, while I was waiting
for him to show up,

1:09:09.858 --> 1:09:12.152
I just was kind of playing
the guitar hanging out.

1:09:12.653 --> 1:09:15.656
And he walked in the studio
and introduced himself

1:09:15.656 --> 1:09:16.823

figure out a certain melody,

getting the sound right.

I put my [bleep] in her [bleep]

1:12:15.419 --> 1:12:17.379
'cause if y'all really think
I ever gave a fuck

1:12:17.379 --> 1:12:19.047
about anything y'all be saying,

1:12:19.047 --> 1:12:20.716
all right, y'all going
to make me miserable.

1:12:20.716 --> 1:12:23.218
[bleep] y'all little sisters.
They [bleep].

1:12:23.218 --> 1:12:25.512
I swear to god. I swear to god.

1:12:25.512 --> 1:12:29.224
Everybody that called me
a domestic abuser,

1:12:29.224 --> 1:12:32.144
I'm finna domestically abuse
your little sister [bleep]

1:12:32.144 --> 1:12:33.395
from the back...

1:12:34.021 --> 1:12:35.522
[cackles]

1:12:35.856 --> 1:12:37.191
Is this making you mad yet?

1:12:38.066 --> 1:12:39.776
If you hate me, are you mad yet?

1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:41.945
Are you going to go on Reddit and post

1:12:41.945 --> 1:12:43.572
really bad things about me?

1:12:44.198 --> 1:12:46.783
Hashtag insensitive.

1:12:47.659 --> 1:12:49.453
GHAZI SHAMI:
He had gone on social media,

1:12:49.453 --> 1:12:51.914
and I think it was on his story

1:12:52.497 --> 1:12:54.374
and he had a girl next to him

1:12:54.374 --> 1:12:55.792
and they were laughing and giggling

1:12:55.792 --> 1:12:57.127
and he made a pretty...

1:12:58.337 --> 1:13:00.589
aggressive remark towards women.

1:13:00.589 --> 1:13:03.592
And, um, it was pretty bad.

1:13:03.592 --> 1:13:05.928
I mean, it was bad enough
that women in my office

1:13:05.928 --> 1:13:07.095
were talking about it.

1:13:07.095 --> 1:13:08.388
And so...

1:13:09.223 --> 1:13:11.600
we all decided to jump
on the phone with him.

1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:14.394
It was me, his mom...

1:13:15.771 --> 1:13:18.440
Solomon,
the criminal attorney,

1:13:19.191 --> 1:13:20.734
and the entertainment attorney.

1:13:21.985 --> 1:13:23.654
I don't think anybody else
was on the call.

1:13:23.654 --> 1:13:25.155
It was a group call.

1:13:25.155 --> 1:13:28.158
And they kind of wanted to address
some of his actions.

1:13:28.158 --> 1:13:30.994
And he wasn't fucking with it.

1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:33.330
He was really upset.

1:13:33.956 --> 1:13:35.207
Started yelling at us.

1:13:35.207 --> 1:13:36.917
He was always adamant that he wanted

1:13:36.917 --> 1:13:38.919
to express whatever it was
he wanted to express,

1:13:38.919 --> 1:13:41.380
and he didn't give a fuck what anybody had
to think about it.

1:13:42.381 --> 1:13:43.507
And so...

1:13:45.008 --> 1:13:47.010
I remember we hung up the phone,

1:13:47.010 --> 1:13:48.637
but I called him

1:13:48.637 --> 1:13:51.348
and I was like,
"Bro, let me holler at you."

1:13:51.890 --> 1:13:53.058
And he was like, "What's up?"

1:13:53.976 --> 1:13:55.060
And I said to him.

1:13:57.187 --> 1:13:59.439
"You know, you've spent...

1:14:00.607 --> 1:14:03.777
"all this time building this relationship

1:14:03.777 --> 1:14:05.821
"to your audience on social media.

1:14:06.780 --> 1:14:09.700
"And I know you really love

1:14:09.700 --> 1:14:11.535
"and cherish this role of the villain

1:14:12.703 --> 1:14:14.663
"and the villain
has gotten you pretty far,

1:14:15.622 --> 1:14:17.708
"but I don't think you need
to be the villain anymore.

1:14:17.708 --> 1:14:20.169
You're already poppin'.
Just be who you are."

1:14:20.711 --> 1:14:24.423
And I don't know, for whatever reason,

1:14:24.423 --> 1:14:26.466
I don't know if it was that conversation,

1:14:26.466 --> 1:14:28.760
I don't know if he had
other conversations with his mom

1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:31.513
or his other friends
around him or whatever.

1:14:31.513 --> 1:14:33.432
But I want to say that, like,

1:14:33.432 --> 1:14:36.393
something definitely changed
after that incident.

1:14:36.393 --> 1:14:37.978
Things started to change with him.

1:14:37.978 --> 1:14:39.188
[sniffs]

1:14:40.022 --> 1:14:43.150
- Um, I apologize to anyone I've offended

1:14:43.150 --> 1:14:44.693
within the last couple hours.

1:14:44.693 --> 1:14:46.528
Obviously, you guys know
I'm going through a lot

1:14:46.528 --> 1:14:48.405
just, uh, due to this case.

1:14:48.405 --> 1:14:50.365
If I want to assert myself

1:14:50.365 --> 1:14:52.534
in my career or have my views respected,

1:14:52.534 --> 1:14:55.287
I realize that I have
to treat everything with care

1:14:55.287 --> 1:14:57.372
and take time
and have patience with people.

1:14:57.372 --> 1:14:59.541
I just want people to know
that I'm not trying to lead

1:14:59.541 --> 1:15:02.503
their children down a dark, dark path,

1:15:02.503 --> 1:15:04.588
and that I really want something
good for the human race.

1:15:04.588 --> 1:15:07.299
So, with that being said,
I hope everyone has a good...

1:15:07.299 --> 1:15:09.635
BASS: There's some issues
where people need to be scrutinized

1:15:09.635 --> 1:15:11.094
and some issues where people just need

1:15:11.094 --> 1:15:12.930
to be put away. You feel me?

1:15:12.930 --> 1:15:15.057
But there are some issues
where people need help,

1:15:15.057 --> 1:15:16.517
especially kids.

1:15:17.017 --> 1:15:18.435
He was mature.

1:15:18.435 --> 1:15:20.604
Streetwise, he was mature.

1:15:20.604 --> 1:15:23.899
He was music business savvy.
You know I mean?

1:15:23.899 --> 1:15:25.150
He had a lot of--

1:15:25.150 --> 1:15:27.236
So, he had to have
some type of, like, hustle

1:15:27.236 --> 1:15:29.446
in his family background,
you could tell that.

1:15:29.446 --> 1:15:32.032
But at the end of the day,
like emotionally,

1:15:32.032 --> 1:15:33.867
he wasn't, he wasn't there yet.

1:15:40.499 --> 1:15:42.918
- It made me, I mean,
it made me sad, you know.

1:15:42.918 --> 1:15:45.420
He allegedly did to her
what she, what he allegedly did.

1:15:45.420 --> 1:15:47.923
But that doesn't mean
that he didn't suffer as well.

1:15:47.923 --> 1:15:50.092
That doesn't make him just
a two-dimensional person, either.

1:16:22.916 --> 1:16:24.960
SOLOMON:
I saw him battle with his demons

1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:26.461
from the very beginning.

1:16:26.461 --> 1:16:28.088
I wish I could have helped more.

1:16:28.088 --> 1:16:29.965
I didn't know how to help.
I didn't know what to do.

1:16:30.424 --> 1:16:33.135
- It's one of those days where you realize
nothing fucking matters.

1:16:35.804 --> 1:16:38.015
One of those days where you feel
like driving off a bridge.

1:16:40.642 --> 1:16:42.269
Am I really quitting? Yes, I'm quitting.

1:16:43.061 --> 1:16:44.396
I don't know for how long.

1:16:44.396 --> 1:16:46.440
But I'm just not going
to make music right now.

1:16:47.691 --> 1:16:51.028
I mean, it's just been
that my mind's been fucked up.

1:16:51.028 --> 1:16:52.863
My mind has been somewhere else.

1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:57.868
SOLOMON: He saw a doctor
and was diagnosed as bipolar.

1:16:58.619 --> 1:17:00.579
They were giving him medicine to take.

1:17:00.579 --> 1:17:02.748
You know, he hated
the medicine, of course.

1:17:02.748 --> 1:17:07.002
The medicine made him dull, uncreative.

1:17:07.002 --> 1:17:09.755
It was hard for him to be himself.

1:17:09.755 --> 1:17:11.381
- What are they going to say now?

1:17:12.841 --> 1:17:14.468
Isn't it clear I don't give a fuck?

1:17:15.427 --> 1:17:17.638
CLEOPATRA:
He made himself ugly at one point

1:17:17.638 --> 1:17:19.890
by shaving off his eyebrows,
that's what he called it,

1:17:19.890 --> 1:17:21.850
shedding who he was.

1:17:21.850 --> 1:17:24.394
JAHSEH: If you feel
as if your physical identity

1:17:24.394 --> 1:17:26.813
has to be the same as everyone else's

1:17:26.813 --> 1:17:29.066
to be socially acceptable, you're stupid.

1:17:29.858 --> 1:17:31.360
Be yourself.

1:17:31.360 --> 1:17:33.028
COOLIECUT:
He wanted to trip acid.

1:17:33.779 --> 1:17:35.405
I think he was kind of trying
to free his mind

1:17:35.405 --> 1:17:37.032
from everything that was going on.

1:17:37.616 --> 1:17:40.035
But it was kind of
to dig deeper into yourself

1:17:40.035 --> 1:17:42.079
to understand like,
"Why you think like this?

1:17:42.079 --> 1:17:43.664
Why do you act like that?"

1:17:43.664 --> 1:17:46.333
He wanted to shed his skin.
He kept saying it to me.

1:17:46.333 --> 1:17:48.168
He was like,
"Bro, I feel like I don't like this.

1:17:48.168 --> 1:17:49.920
You feel me? The skin I'm in."

1:17:49.920 --> 1:17:51.421
He just meant like he wanted to become

1:17:51.421 --> 1:17:53.006
a better person, you know what I mean?

1:17:53.006 --> 1:17:54.550
He just kept saying that over and over.

1:17:54.550 --> 1:17:55.926
I was like, "Yeah, I feel you, bro.

1:17:55.926 --> 1:17:57.177
"We're going to get through this.

1:17:57.177 --> 1:17:58.929
"You're going to become
a better person, bro. Don't worry."

and sometimes in between the process,

1:18:14.069 --> 1:18:16.864
I would kind of leave my phone
on just forgetting about it,

1:18:16.864 --> 1:18:19.283

- Okay, guys, so basically,

1:20:23.699 --> 1:20:25.909
this is what I wanted to explain today,

1:20:25.909 --> 1:20:27.995
um, just based off of what I've learned.

1:20:28.412 --> 1:20:31.665
You have to take a second to sit down
to thoroughly observe your patterns.

1:20:31.665 --> 1:20:33.709
Do you move when you don't want to move?

1:20:33.709 --> 1:20:36.253
Do you get angry
when you don't want to get angry?

1:20:36.253 --> 1:20:37.796
You have to fix
these things about yourself.

1:20:37.796 --> 1:20:39.673
You have to give a fuck about yourself.

1:20:39.673 --> 1:20:41.592
And that makes life so much better.

1:20:41.592 --> 1:20:43.302
Like, I'm learning to do it now.

1:20:43.302 --> 1:20:45.762
And it makes life 10 times better.

1:20:45.762 --> 1:20:46.889
It makes you feel better.

1:20:47.264 --> 1:20:49.016
I want you to start a journal.

1:20:49.892 --> 1:20:52.352
COOLIECUT: That's when
the internal change was happening.

1:20:52.352 --> 1:20:54.104
He was actually changing internally,

1:20:54.104 --> 1:20:55.814
trying to preach a positive message

1:20:55.814 --> 1:20:58.650
because he kind of had a negative impact.

1:20:58.650 --> 1:20:59.943
And he wanted to balance that out.

1:20:59.943 --> 1:21:02.070
JAHSEH: I'm going to stop
calling you guys fans.

1:21:02.070 --> 1:21:04.615
I'm going to start calling you
members of my cult.

1:21:05.032 --> 1:21:07.242
This is a cult. Not a fan base.

1:21:07.242 --> 1:21:10.579
While we have this big family
of a fan base

1:21:10.579 --> 1:21:12.164
and there's a lot of us
that are depressed,

1:21:12.164 --> 1:21:14.499
myself, including myself.

1:21:14.499 --> 1:21:15.626
There's a lot of us that are depressed,

1:21:15.626 --> 1:21:17.586
so just hashtag my name

1:21:17.586 --> 1:21:20.214
and find another person
that listens to my music

1:21:20.214 --> 1:21:21.673
and help them through their problems.

1:21:21.673 --> 1:21:23.967
So, here's what we'll do,
we'll start a hashtag today.

1:21:23.967 --> 1:21:25.928
Um, I want you to get this trending.

1:21:25.928 --> 1:21:29.264
Hashtag #Youtellmeyourproblems
andI'lltellyoumine,

1:21:29.264 --> 1:21:31.642
and we will use this hashtag
to communicate

1:21:31.642 --> 1:21:33.977
with other fr-- uh, fans and friends,

1:21:33.977 --> 1:21:36.480
uh, and that listen to my music,
that need help.

1:21:36.897 --> 1:21:40.317
- He did not want that image
to follow him around

1:21:40.317 --> 1:21:41.485
for the rest of his life.

1:21:42.361 --> 1:21:44.488
But when it comes
to his relationship with Geneva,

1:21:45.280 --> 1:21:46.990
I do sincerely think that he wanted

1:21:46.990 --> 1:21:49.451
to fix his relationship
with her privately.

1:21:49.451 --> 1:21:53.163
But between the law,
the case, and then the public,

1:21:53.830 --> 1:21:56.041
it, that was like an impossible task.

1:21:56.500 --> 1:21:58.502
- He had what's called

1:21:58.502 --> 1:22:00.879
a no contest order of protection

1:22:00.879 --> 1:22:02.881
against, uh, Geneva.

1:22:03.966 --> 1:22:07.344
- ♪ Under the assumption
love is dead, already ♪

1:22:08.679 --> 1:22:10.597
♪ Just let me be here ♪

1:22:12.266 --> 1:22:15.561
One of the girls that he was living with,
she hit me up on Instagram,

1:22:15.561 --> 1:22:17.271
she told me that Jahseh wanted
to speak to me.

1:22:18.146 --> 1:22:20.649
And I was like, "What?"

1:22:22.067 --> 1:22:24.236
And I was speaking to him,
I was on FaceTime with him,

1:22:24.236 --> 1:22:26.738
and he was telling me
that he wanted to meet up

1:22:26.738 --> 1:22:28.490
and apologize to me.

1:22:28.490 --> 1:22:29.992
And I was really scared
because I didn't know

1:22:29.992 --> 1:22:31.243
if it was a setup.

1:22:31.243 --> 1:22:32.995
I was, like, still very afraid of him.

1:22:33.453 --> 1:22:34.580
So, I was scared.

1:22:35.622 --> 1:22:38.417
But I just had to, like, overcome that.

1:22:38.417 --> 1:22:42.087
I felt like I had to face my problems.

1:22:43.130 --> 1:22:46.717
- Reporting live from Florida,
with the alleged hurricane...

1:22:46.717 --> 1:22:48.343
GENEVA:
We'd, like, hang out here and there.

1:22:48.343 --> 1:22:50.762
I spent a whole weekend with him

1:22:50.762 --> 1:22:53.807
during a hurricane
and like, nobody even knew.

1:22:53.807 --> 1:22:56.185
People online would be like,
they hate each other.

1:22:56.602 --> 1:22:58.353
But in reality, like, we were talking.

1:22:59.771 --> 1:23:03.817
For me, like, I found sympathy
and empathy in the situation,

1:23:03.817 --> 1:23:06.904
and I was able to literally
just, like, forgive him

1:23:06.904 --> 1:23:08.697
because I feel like...

1:23:08.697 --> 1:23:10.574
I basically compared it to my mother.

1:23:10.574 --> 1:23:12.576
Like, my mother has abused me.

1:23:12.576 --> 1:23:15.037
And you don't see people

1:23:15.037 --> 1:23:16.788
disowning their mother because of that--

1:23:16.788 --> 1:23:20.417
Well, you do, but not
necessarily in every instance.

1:23:26.423 --> 1:23:28.842
JOHN: They both had an opinion
on what should happen.

1:23:28.842 --> 1:23:32.054
But at some point, the state
of Florida wanted otherwise.

1:23:34.723 --> 1:23:37.768
SOLOMON:
When Geneva sends in her affidavit

1:23:37.768 --> 1:23:40.812
to say she no longer wanted

1:23:40.812 --> 1:23:43.232
to pursue criminal charges,

1:23:43.232 --> 1:23:47.277
I think that prompted them
to go through the jail calls.

1:23:47.277 --> 1:23:49.613
You know, there was
so much stuff on there,

1:23:49.613 --> 1:23:51.657
they easily charged Jahseh

1:23:51.657 --> 1:23:54.743
with a bunch of new counts
of witness tampering.

1:23:56.203 --> 1:23:59.373
- Okay, guys, so I was
just given seven more charges,

1:23:59.373 --> 1:24:01.333
uh, by the state attorney's office,

1:24:01.333 --> 1:24:03.877
uh, and I have a court date on the 15th.

1:24:04.294 --> 1:24:07.631
So, I would ask that everyone
come to support me.

1:24:08.090 --> 1:24:11.927
I ask that the people that do come
come bearing positive energy.

1:24:12.386 --> 1:24:14.388
JOHN:
He had this court date in December.

1:24:14.888 --> 1:24:16.682
The day before, I was asking him, like,

1:24:16.682 --> 1:24:19.351
"What's the worst thing
that can happen tomorrow?"

1:24:19.351 --> 1:24:21.812
He answered that he'd be
taken in for a couple hours

1:24:21.812 --> 1:24:24.398
and they'd be able to get him out
that same day.

1:24:24.398 --> 1:24:27.651
- The fans took over
the, the whole courthouse.

1:24:27.651 --> 1:24:29.444
They were calling the judge,

1:24:29.444 --> 1:24:31.488
like doing all kinds of crazy stuff.

1:24:31.488 --> 1:24:32.781
Soon as you walk into the room,

1:24:32.781 --> 1:24:35.325
you could feel the energy from the judge.

1:24:35.325 --> 1:24:37.953
He didn't even get a chance to say a word.

1:24:37.953 --> 1:24:39.788
She just started going in.

1:24:50.215 --> 1:24:51.675
DEANDRA: It seemed like
she just knew in her mind

1:24:51.675 --> 1:24:54.052
she was going to take him that day
to make an example of,

1:24:54.052 --> 1:24:55.721
you don't have more power than we do.

1:24:57.055 --> 1:24:59.183
SOLOMON: They ended up
taking him in for a week.

1:25:00.559 --> 1:25:02.394
CLEOPATRA:
All those charges added up.

1:25:02.394 --> 1:25:04.938
So, I believe he was looking at 20 years.

1:25:04.938 --> 1:25:06.607
Now because of his status,

1:25:06.607 --> 1:25:10.110
it requires him to be
segregated in solitary.

1:25:10.694 --> 1:25:12.696
Not being in general population,

1:25:12.696 --> 1:25:14.114
he doesn't have access

1:25:14.114 --> 1:25:15.782
to sitting and talking to people

1:25:15.782 --> 1:25:17.993
or anything that can stimulate him.

1:25:17.993 --> 1:25:20.954
And he already struggled
with hearing voices in his head

1:25:20.954 --> 1:25:22.539
and being alone.

1:25:22.539 --> 1:25:26.210
Any time in, you know,
locked up in solitary

1:25:26.752 --> 1:25:28.462
would be a problem for him.

1:25:28.462 --> 1:25:29.505
And we knew that.

1:25:39.473 --> 1:25:41.642
DEANDRA: It doesn't matter
how many times he spoke

1:25:41.642 --> 1:25:43.977
about, like, helping each other
or something like that,

1:25:43.977 --> 1:25:46.021
it was always, okay, but he beat Geneva.

1:25:47.898 --> 1:25:51.068
Like, he can never have a conversation

1:25:51.068 --> 1:25:52.694
without that being,

1:25:53.195 --> 1:25:54.655
going back to being the topic.

1:25:58.075 --> 1:25:59.409
- Why is it wrong?

1:25:59.409 --> 1:26:00.869
- How do you fully redeem yourself

1:26:00.869 --> 1:26:03.163
if every time on every corner

1:26:03.664 --> 1:26:05.249
it just keeps popping up?

1:26:12.047 --> 1:26:15.300
- He acknowledged that he was,
that there was a situation,

1:26:15.300 --> 1:26:18.011
you know, but self-acknowledgment
and accountability,

1:26:18.011 --> 1:26:20.556
do I have to hold myself accountable

1:26:20.556 --> 1:26:22.391
and admit it to the world

1:26:22.391 --> 1:26:24.142
just for you guys to judge me anyways?

1:26:25.602 --> 1:26:27.729
They were going to judge him
no matter what.

1:26:27.729 --> 1:26:29.648
You know, without knowing the full story.

1:26:29.648 --> 1:26:31.817
It didn't matter if he spoke
that full story,

1:26:31.817 --> 1:26:34.027
they were going to judge him
no matter what.

1:26:34.027 --> 1:26:35.904
And that's all he had,
that's all he was going through,

1:26:35.904 --> 1:26:37.197
was being judged.

1:26:37.197 --> 1:26:38.574
He could release a number one album.

1:26:38.574 --> 1:26:39.825
You could love his song.

1:26:39.825 --> 1:26:41.285
But then they were still judging him

1:26:41.910 --> 1:26:43.120
based on that situation.

1:26:43.120 --> 1:26:45.205
It wasn't something he was able to escape,

1:26:45.205 --> 1:26:46.957
even though he was
holding himself accountable.

1:26:51.044 --> 1:26:53.255
- I think it also might have
resulted in them taking

1:26:53.255 --> 1:26:55.048
- his whole life away.
CLEOPATRA: Yeah.

1:26:55.048 --> 1:26:57.176
- I think, I think it makes sense that

1:26:57.176 --> 1:26:59.261
that's an apology that needs to be

1:26:59.261 --> 1:27:01.680
kind of more, um, planned out

1:27:01.680 --> 1:27:05.142
in a way that, like, has
an actual beneficial result

1:27:05.142 --> 1:27:06.852
and not one that, you know,

1:27:06.852 --> 1:27:09.354
results in somebody getting
their entire freedom

1:27:09.354 --> 1:27:10.647
and life taken away.

1:27:11.982 --> 1:27:14.443
- But I do think he would have
gotten to a place where he would have

1:27:15.527 --> 1:27:18.530
gotten there, it just,
he just never had a chance to.

1:27:41.887 --> 1:27:44.681
GUY WHEELER: I got a call
from a well-known psychologist

1:27:44.681 --> 1:27:47.267
by the name of Dr. Michael Brannon.

1:27:47.267 --> 1:27:50.854
The judge decided that
I was going to work with him.

1:27:50.854 --> 1:27:52.272
The judge pointed at me, he says,

1:27:52.272 --> 1:27:54.149
"Everywhere he go,
he's got to go, you got to go.

1:27:54.149 --> 1:27:56.318
He can't go anywhere without you."

1:27:56.777 --> 1:28:00.656
Well, the first day, it was,
it was people here galore.

1:28:01.031 --> 1:28:02.658
I didn't want to go right then and there

1:28:02.658 --> 1:28:04.409
in a sit-down face-to-face,

1:28:04.409 --> 1:28:06.870
because from a cultural
kind of background,

1:28:06.870 --> 1:28:08.830
the connotations of therapy

1:28:08.830 --> 1:28:11.583
and counseling perception is
what goes along with that.

1:28:11.583 --> 1:28:13.460
"I'm crazy, I'm loco and I ain't crazy."

1:28:13.460 --> 1:28:15.128
As a matter of fact,
he mentioned that, you know,

1:28:15.128 --> 1:28:16.547
"Ain't nothing wrong with me.
I ain't crazy."

1:28:16.547 --> 1:28:18.841
I said, "Man, let's walk,
let's just walk."

1:28:18.841 --> 1:28:20.843
"Man, I got problems like anybody else."

1:28:21.260 --> 1:28:22.719
I said, "Look, I'm here, man,

1:28:23.470 --> 1:28:25.389
"you know, to treat you
like a human being.

1:28:25.389 --> 1:28:27.933
"It's about your life, man.
That's a bigger picture to me.

1:28:27.933 --> 1:28:29.434
I'm concerned about you."

1:28:29.434 --> 1:28:30.853
And he looked like that,

1:28:31.854 --> 1:28:33.522
pointed at me, he's like, "Straight."

1:28:33.522 --> 1:28:34.898
- I do not at all want--

1:28:34.898 --> 1:28:36.316
SOLOMON:
Guy was rule-based.

1:28:36.316 --> 1:28:38.318
He was like, "Yo, you got
to clean this shit up.

1:28:38.318 --> 1:28:40.529
"Way too many people in
and out of your house, bro.

1:28:40.529 --> 1:28:43.532
"You not, you can't control
what these people are going to do.

1:28:43.532 --> 1:28:45.450
"Something bad is going to happen.
Yo, you know what?

1:28:45.450 --> 1:28:46.952
"You can't have
all these women in your house.

1:28:46.952 --> 1:28:48.203
"That's going to lead to something.

1:28:48.203 --> 1:28:50.122
You just pick one and call it a day."

1:28:50.831 --> 1:28:52.165
You know, he picked Jen.

1:28:54.918 --> 1:28:56.336
JENESIS SANCHEZ:
Before me and Jah ever dated,

1:28:56.336 --> 1:28:57.588
we were not two people

1:28:57.588 --> 1:28:59.673
that were looking for anything at all.

1:28:59.673 --> 1:29:01.466
He actually wanted me to be his assistant.

1:29:02.050 --> 1:29:03.552
Jah always saw me

1:29:03.552 --> 1:29:06.471
as this very nurturing, caring person,

1:29:07.014 --> 1:29:09.516
and he felt very safe when he was with me

1:29:09.516 --> 1:29:11.018
and I did, too.

1:29:11.018 --> 1:29:13.562
So, he just kind of said, like,

1:29:13.562 --> 1:29:15.272
"You're my girlfriend now,

1:29:15.272 --> 1:29:17.566
"and if you don't want to be here,

1:29:17.566 --> 1:29:20.319
"you don't have to be, but if you want to,

1:29:20.319 --> 1:29:21.778
I would love for you to be."

1:29:21.778 --> 1:29:24.114
I'm like... "Okay."

1:29:24.114 --> 1:29:26.158
I could be your rock, you could be mine.

1:29:28.035 --> 1:29:30.704
I will say, there were
some days I felt like

1:29:30.704 --> 1:29:33.916
I was definitely walking
on shards of glass,

1:29:33.916 --> 1:29:36.502
because you didn't know
what you were going to get.

1:29:37.669 --> 1:29:40.631
GUY: We would have sessions,
we would just sit down and talk and laugh.

1:29:40.631 --> 1:29:42.925
Whatever his pain or whatever
he was going through,

1:29:42.925 --> 1:29:44.384
whatever he wanted to talk to me about,

1:29:44.384 --> 1:29:46.053
personal, family kind of stuff.

1:29:46.053 --> 1:29:48.138
And I recognized then that this was

1:29:48.138 --> 1:29:50.766
a traumatized human being
unable to grieve.

1:29:51.350 --> 1:29:53.143
And he had to play out the macho.

1:29:53.143 --> 1:29:55.270
He's five-foot-two,
he's going to play out this macho,

1:29:55.270 --> 1:29:57.856
the rap and hip-hop
and all of that.

1:29:57.856 --> 1:30:00.025
And he's dealing with
an enormous amount of emotion

1:30:00.025 --> 1:30:01.109
and a lot of stuff.

1:30:01.109 --> 1:30:02.778
I never can be his biological father,

1:30:02.778 --> 1:30:04.154
and that was not my role.

1:30:04.154 --> 1:30:06.365
But if anything, that I can be there

1:30:06.365 --> 1:30:08.492
and that I didn't want money from him,

1:30:08.492 --> 1:30:10.202
it was about him

1:30:10.202 --> 1:30:13.455
just as a human being

1:30:13.455 --> 1:30:16.208
that deserved the dignity and respect.

[indiscernible singing]

1:30:32.683 --> 1:30:34.142
JOHN:
And I know this from what Cleo

1:30:34.142 --> 1:30:35.477
and Solomon and everyone told me.

1:30:35.477 --> 1:30:37.729
It's like when I was around
making music with him,

1:30:37.729 --> 1:30:39.356
that's when he was happy.

1:30:39.356 --> 1:30:42.359
I realized that, like,
the process of making music

1:30:42.359 --> 1:30:43.986
and being able to put
his mind on something

1:30:43.986 --> 1:30:45.737
was what allowed him to free his mind

1:30:45.737 --> 1:30:48.156
off of all the other places
that it was going.

CLEOPATRA:
He was on house arrest,

1:31:23.066 --> 1:31:25.611
and going to the studio
and having to be home

1:31:25.611 --> 1:31:27.404
at a certain time became an issue.

1:31:27.404 --> 1:31:29.615
And so we decided to knock out the closets

1:31:29.615 --> 1:31:31.783
and build a studio in home for him.

1:31:37.748 --> 1:31:39.541
in early January that

1:31:39.541 --> 1:31:41.418
he was asking me if I had any beats.

1:31:41.418 --> 1:31:43.378
And I said,
"Yeah, I have beats from this person

1:31:43.378 --> 1:31:45.923
"and that person and this producer

1:31:45.923 --> 1:31:48.050

and he said, "No, you."

1:31:48.050 --> 1:31:50.260

into my box account on his computer.

I was trying to figure out
what to play him,

1:31:58.060 --> 1:32:00.354
he clicked on something
called "Sad Banjo,"

1:32:00.354 --> 1:32:02.564

- Mm- hm. Yeah.

1:32:29.383 --> 1:32:32.344
JOHN: Like, the day we got
the mix of "SAD!" back,

1:32:32.344 --> 1:32:34.555
I remember us kind of looking
at each other and being like,

1:32:34.555 --> 1:32:36.014
"This is different."

1:32:36.014 --> 1:32:38.392
There was always this desire
to have something

1:32:38.392 --> 1:32:40.435
that just would kind of set him apart

1:32:40.435 --> 1:32:42.938
from everyone else that he was
being compared to at the time.

1:32:42.938 --> 1:32:45.941
And this would have been a song
where there's zero rapping on it.

1:32:46.358 --> 1:32:48.944
And the idea of this song coming out,

1:32:48.944 --> 1:32:51.655
especially at the same time
as a song called "Changes,"

1:32:51.655 --> 1:32:53.866
that excited me and it excited him.

1:32:53.866 --> 1:32:55.826
And then when those two songs came out...

1:32:57.369 --> 1:32:59.830
I felt like the entire world changed.

JOHN: And, you know,
in the "Sad!" music video,

1:33:31.403 --> 1:33:32.821
he kills his former self,

1:33:32.821 --> 1:33:37.242
and he was really deliberate
about not attaching

1:33:37.242 --> 1:33:39.369
who he was in 2018

1:33:39.369 --> 1:33:41.079

CLEOPATRA: Transitioning into
the blue hair was indigo child

1:34:00.557 --> 1:34:02.267
coming into himself

1:34:02.267 --> 1:34:04.144
and realizing his responsibility

1:34:04.144 --> 1:34:06.063
to this generation.

1:34:06.063 --> 1:34:07.523
You know, him and I had a conversation

1:34:07.523 --> 1:34:09.441
about what are you going to be?

1:34:09.441 --> 1:34:11.777
What do you want these kids
to walk away with?

1:34:11.777 --> 1:34:13.403
You know what I'm saying,
what's your message?

1:34:14.238 --> 1:34:16.323
And he realized he had an obligation

1:34:16.323 --> 1:34:17.908
that was bigger than himself.

1:34:17.908 --> 1:34:21.245
And so he chose to take that path.

1:34:25.082 --> 1:34:28.001
- Um, okay, so my current focus

1:34:28.544 --> 1:34:30.045
is creation and evolution.

1:34:30.462 --> 1:34:34.383
It's better to be respected
through love rather than fear

1:34:34.383 --> 1:34:37.219
simply because, like, all right,
I was respected through fear

1:34:37.219 --> 1:34:38.512
and it's not real love.

1:34:38.512 --> 1:34:41.056
It's not real love,
and it drives people away.

1:34:41.056 --> 1:34:42.432
It makes people treat you differently.

1:34:42.432 --> 1:34:44.518
It makes people really, like--

1:34:45.269 --> 1:34:46.562
It's just not genuine.

1:34:46.562 --> 1:34:48.522
It's not what you really would want.

1:34:49.439 --> 1:34:51.900
It's better not to be
a crazy motherfucker.

1:34:51.900 --> 1:34:53.861
It's better not. 'Cause I've, I've--

1:34:53.861 --> 1:34:56.154
I've been-- I've went through that.
I've decided I want--

1:34:56.154 --> 1:34:57.865
There was a point where
I wanted to be the villain,

1:34:57.865 --> 1:34:59.867
and it's not fun, bro. It's not fun.

1:34:59.867 --> 1:35:02.369
People t--
Like, it doesn't attract anything

1:35:02.369 --> 1:35:03.662
that you truly want.

1:35:03.662 --> 1:35:05.789
I've started to look at myself
very differently

1:35:05.789 --> 1:35:07.457
and beat myself up.

1:35:07.457 --> 1:35:09.918
And you guys are the only thing
that gives me hope.

1:35:09.918 --> 1:35:11.712
You guys are the only things that,

1:35:11.712 --> 1:35:13.255
that thing that motivates me

1:35:13.255 --> 1:35:15.841
to ideally like, yo, be strong.

1:35:15.841 --> 1:35:20.512
You have over eight million kids or adults

1:35:20.512 --> 1:35:22.556
and teenagers watching you

1:35:23.348 --> 1:35:24.725
relying on you for this hope.

1:35:26.852 --> 1:35:28.854
DEANDRA:
Jahseh was becoming more patient.

1:35:28.854 --> 1:35:32.566
He was more positive versus
being so angry all the time.

1:35:32.566 --> 1:35:34.943
You can reason with him

1:35:34.943 --> 1:35:37.487
because he was able
to reason with himself.

1:35:37.487 --> 1:35:40.490
- When the nigga would just
usually freak out and trip out,

1:35:40.490 --> 1:35:41.909
you would see him go into a corner

1:35:41.909 --> 1:35:43.827
and do breathing exercises, you feel me?

1:35:43.827 --> 1:35:45.287
Keep his eyes closed, meditate,

1:35:45.287 --> 1:35:47.206
even if it's for, like,
a little 10 minutes,

1:35:47.206 --> 1:35:49.291
then come back and address the situation.

1:35:56.673 --> 1:35:58.967
JENESIS:
One day I get home, and I'm like,

1:35:58.967 --> 1:36:01.595
something, something doesn't feel right.

1:36:01.595 --> 1:36:04.056
The next day, I took a pregnancy test

1:36:04.056 --> 1:36:06.600
and sure enough,
I find out that I'm pregnant.

1:36:07.309 --> 1:36:10.395
Jah had, like, 30 phones,
it was so ridiculous.

1:36:10.395 --> 1:36:12.940
So, I'm, like, sending
the picture to all these phones

1:36:12.940 --> 1:36:14.316
because I couldn't get ahold of him.

1:36:14.316 --> 1:36:16.026
Turns out he was at the gym training.

1:36:16.026 --> 1:36:17.861
Finally, when I got ahold of Jah,

1:36:17.861 --> 1:36:19.071
he was super excited.

1:36:19.071 --> 1:36:21.114
Like, he was like, "No way."

1:36:21.532 --> 1:36:23.742
- Family and success.

1:36:24.117 --> 1:36:26.787
[all cheering]
WOMAN: Cheers.

1:36:29.748 --> 1:36:32.042
- I almost felt like he knew
how to relate to kids

1:36:32.042 --> 1:36:34.461
more than he did other people.

1:36:37.548 --> 1:36:41.969
And he saw this emotional
phenomenon in children

1:36:41.969 --> 1:36:45.097
that they were pure and unable to judge

1:36:45.097 --> 1:36:47.891
and unable to have hatred in their heart.

1:36:47.891 --> 1:36:49.518
And he loved that so much

1:36:49.518 --> 1:36:52.187
that the idea of having a kid of his own

1:36:52.187 --> 1:36:55.816
and being able to instill
this sense of acceptance

1:36:55.816 --> 1:36:59.194
and lovingness and positivity
within this kid

1:37:00.487 --> 1:37:02.114
would have been his proudest moment.

1:37:07.494 --> 1:37:10.873
GHAZI: I know one incident,
I had took him to Nobu.

1:37:10.873 --> 1:37:13.333
It was his first time
eating at a fancy restaurant.

1:37:13.834 --> 1:37:15.002
And they pulled up

1:37:15.961 --> 1:37:17.379
and we were sitting down eating,

1:37:17.379 --> 1:37:19.423
and he was fucking around
with the chopsticks

1:37:19.423 --> 1:37:21.008
and we were just sitting there

1:37:21.008 --> 1:37:22.885
and we started talking about kids.

1:37:22.885 --> 1:37:25.762
He was like, "You're going
to be a great dad."

1:37:25.762 --> 1:37:28.223
I said, "You're going to be
a great dad too someday, bro."

1:37:28.223 --> 1:37:30.851
He said, "No, I'm not."
I said, "What do you mean?"

1:37:31.435 --> 1:37:33.312
And he just looked me dead
in the eye and he was like,

1:37:33.312 --> 1:37:34.688
"I'm not gonna make it past 21."

1:37:34.688 --> 1:37:36.815
And then just went right back
to fuckin' with the chopsticks,

1:37:37.399 --> 1:37:38.859
like he hadn't said a thing.

1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:44.656
CLEOPATRA:
He always spoke about death

1:37:44.656 --> 1:37:45.741
and was fascinated with it,

1:37:45.741 --> 1:37:48.535
I think, since he was about 15.

1:37:49.077 --> 1:37:51.747
It's almost as if he was preparing me

1:37:51.747 --> 1:37:53.207
that he wasn't going to be here.

1:37:55.959 --> 1:37:58.962
His lawyers called and told me that, um,

1:37:59.546 --> 1:38:02.382
they were coming to pick Jah up Tuesday.

1:38:11.975 --> 1:38:15.395
I had the worst anxiety ever.

1:38:15.896 --> 1:38:18.899
[loud hip-hop music playing]

1:38:24.196 --> 1:38:27.741
I went to the studio
and he was working on his first beat.

1:38:29.368 --> 1:38:30.744
And he was so proud.

1:38:31.912 --> 1:38:33.163
[sniffles]

1:38:33.163 --> 1:38:34.456
[exhales]

1:38:34.456 --> 1:38:35.999
And I was so proud because I was like,

1:38:35.999 --> 1:38:37.459
"Yo, where did you come from?

1:38:37.459 --> 1:38:39.920
How did you even learn
to do these things, you know?"

1:38:42.381 --> 1:38:44.716
He spoke about possibly running.

1:38:45.509 --> 1:38:47.052
And I was like,
"Jah, where are you going to go?

1:38:47.845 --> 1:38:50.597
"You have blue hair with tats
all over your face.

1:38:51.098 --> 1:38:54.601
You're not exactly going
to blend in with the crowd."

1:38:54.601 --> 1:38:56.645
And, um, he was like,

1:38:56.645 --> 1:39:00.399
"I can't, I don't understand
what's happening or why."

1:39:00.399 --> 1:39:02.734
And I said, "Kid, you're powerful."

1:39:03.402 --> 1:39:07.781
I said, "I've watched you
control your crowd and your audience."

1:39:07.781 --> 1:39:10.325
I said, "That's, that's dangerous

1:39:11.118 --> 1:39:12.244
to the status quo."

1:39:12.244 --> 1:39:14.997
He got up from around the table
and he said, um,

1:39:16.748 --> 1:39:18.917
"To whom much is given, much is required."

1:39:20.294 --> 1:39:22.880
And then he said, "You know,
I'm going to go buy a bike."

1:39:22.880 --> 1:39:24.464
And I was like, "What? Why?"

1:39:25.174 --> 1:39:27.593
Because at the time, he had
about three bikes in the garage

1:39:27.593 --> 1:39:29.928
and then some other ones
at his other house

1:39:29.928 --> 1:39:31.930
that he doesn't even ride them.

1:39:31.930 --> 1:39:34.558
But I knew my son. I knew it was
because he was so worried.

1:39:34.558 --> 1:39:35.809
He was so scared.

1:39:35.809 --> 1:39:36.977
Typically, I'd be, like,

1:39:37.603 --> 1:39:40.689
arguing with him
about those type of things,

1:39:40.689 --> 1:39:43.942
if it doesn't make sense,
but I knew what that was.

1:39:43.942 --> 1:39:46.945
And so I was like, "Okay, let me
get security together for you."

1:39:46.945 --> 1:39:49.740
And he was like, "Nah,
they're going to take too long."

1:39:49.740 --> 1:39:52.951
I called Jazz's brother,
which is Aiden's dad.

1:39:52.951 --> 1:39:55.787
I called him and I was like, "Hey, um,

1:39:55.787 --> 1:39:57.664
"Jah wants to go pick up this bike.

1:39:57.664 --> 1:39:59.333
"I'm gonna need you to drive his car back

1:39:59.333 --> 1:40:02.544
in the event that he,
he does, um, get the bike."

1:40:02.961 --> 1:40:06.590

don't leave his side."

CLEOPATRA:
When I got the call...

1:41:37.806 --> 1:41:38.765
yeah, I just...

1:41:39.391 --> 1:41:41.143
I just collapsed to the floor.

1:41:44.813 --> 1:41:47.149
- Bro, I think X got shot, bro.

1:41:47.149 --> 1:41:49.943
- Hey!
- I think X got shot, bro.

1:41:51.069 --> 1:41:53.322
I think X got shot, bro!

1:41:54.573 --> 1:41:56.450
I think X got shot!

1:41:57.367 --> 1:41:58.702
- I'm like, "They did what?

1:41:59.328 --> 1:42:00.787
Wait, what do you mean they shot Jahseh?"

1:42:01.288 --> 1:42:03.123
- I remember not having any gas,

1:42:03.624 --> 1:42:05.000
not wanting to stop.

1:42:06.376 --> 1:42:09.171
I'm trying to get to where he was,

1:42:09.171 --> 1:42:12.049
and, um, it's all a blur.

1:42:12.049 --> 1:42:13.800
- And I just remember, like, calling Cleo.

1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:15.761
Like, "Cleo, where are you?"
She's like, "I'm lost."

1:42:15.761 --> 1:42:17.804
She, like, literally didn't know
where she was.

1:42:17.804 --> 1:42:20.140
I'm like, "Bro, you got
to get to the hospital."

1:42:20.140 --> 1:42:21.975
She's like, "I'm trying
to get there, but I-- "

1:42:21.975 --> 1:42:23.435
She's like, "I don't know where I'm at."

1:42:23.435 --> 1:42:24.436
[sniffles]

1:42:26.021 --> 1:42:27.940
- I was like disoriented.

1:42:27.940 --> 1:42:30.317
I got there, there was
a few people there already,

1:42:30.317 --> 1:42:31.944
I'm not sure how they found out.

1:42:31.944 --> 1:42:34.071
And I was just in there from then on,

1:42:34.071 --> 1:42:35.781
pacing back and forth.

1:42:35.781 --> 1:42:38.116
I wasn't able to go back there,

1:42:38.116 --> 1:42:39.493
and they gave me some bullshit story

1:42:39.493 --> 1:42:41.828
about them not wanting me
to see him like that

1:42:41.828 --> 1:42:43.789
because it would traumatize me.

1:42:43.789 --> 1:42:46.583
But I think that I should have
made that decision

1:42:46.583 --> 1:42:48.377
of seeing my son.

1:42:49.086 --> 1:42:51.380
- And then it's like that calm.

1:42:51.380 --> 1:42:53.131
Just, there was like a calm that set in,

1:42:53.131 --> 1:42:54.216
because it's like, "All right.

1:42:54.842 --> 1:42:57.052
"It's Jahseh, like, he's a fighter.

1:42:59.346 --> 1:43:01.098
"He's a fighter.
Jahseh is going to make it through.

1:43:01.098 --> 1:43:02.766
If anybody was going to make it through,
it was going to be him."

1:43:04.142 --> 1:43:07.521
- The cops came out,
and they pulled me in a room

1:43:07.521 --> 1:43:09.857
and I remember

1:43:09.857 --> 1:43:12.568
the officer was just so callous

1:43:12.568 --> 1:43:14.236
when he delivered.

1:43:14.236 --> 1:43:16.989
He was just like,
"Oh, Jahseh expired today

1:43:16.989 --> 1:43:18.365
at such and such time."

1:43:19.867 --> 1:43:23.412
- I still don't understand,
what do you mean by expired?

1:43:30.544 --> 1:43:32.254
- That shit just seem like

1:43:32.963 --> 1:43:36.091
watching a movie or something.

1:43:36.091 --> 1:43:39.469
It's, I-I don't know, I never get,

1:43:40.470 --> 1:43:42.806
come to terms with it.

1:43:45.517 --> 1:43:47.728
- It went from that to just...

1:43:50.647 --> 1:43:51.940
planning a funeral.

1:43:52.733 --> 1:43:54.151
I remember Cleo walking
in the room and saying,

1:43:54.151 --> 1:43:56.111
"How do we plan a funeral?

1:44:00.157 --> 1:44:02.284
How do I plan a funeral for my son?"

CLEOPATRA: His son isn't old enough
to carry on his legacy.

1:45:48.307 --> 1:45:50.142
There's nobody that can do it.

1:45:50.142 --> 1:45:53.645
So I have to not only be here

1:45:53.645 --> 1:45:55.772
for my other son,

1:45:55.772 --> 1:45:58.317
I have to be here to maintain his legacy

1:45:58.317 --> 1:46:01.028
as well as look after my grandson.

1:46:04.406 --> 1:46:06.700
Jah was my practice baby.

1:46:07.284 --> 1:46:08.660
I was 17 years old.

1:46:08.660 --> 1:46:11.288
There was nobody teaching me
how to take care of a child.

1:46:11.288 --> 1:46:13.457
I just had to kind of figure it out.

1:46:14.875 --> 1:46:18.337
Jah kind of changed
my mindset from hammering,

1:46:18.337 --> 1:46:19.880
"You're going to do this,
you're going to do that,"

1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:22.216
because you lose your child doing that.

1:46:23.091 --> 1:46:25.219
You have to allow them to be themselves.

1:46:29.056 --> 1:46:31.099
- How are you?
- Good.

1:46:34.353 --> 1:46:36.063
GENEVA:
After Jahseh died,

1:46:36.063 --> 1:46:39.024
Cleo reached out to me,
like, a year later.

1:46:40.025 --> 1:46:41.568
So, she calls me,

1:46:41.568 --> 1:46:44.029
and before I answer the phone,
I'm like, "Oh my god."

1:46:44.029 --> 1:46:45.906
Like, "I don't know if this
is gonna be bad or good."

1:46:45.906 --> 1:46:48.867
I was, like, alleviated
but really nervous.

1:46:49.493 --> 1:46:52.412
CLEOPATRA: You know, this is,
my son's no longer here,

1:46:52.412 --> 1:46:55.457
and I feel like it's up to me now

1:46:55.457 --> 1:46:58.585
to make amends for any mistakes
that he's done

1:46:58.585 --> 1:47:01.547
and try to right his wrongs
as much as I can.

1:47:01.547 --> 1:47:03.882
I would actually like
to hear you tell your story

1:47:03.882 --> 1:47:05.425
because like I said, my son died

1:47:05.425 --> 1:47:08.220
and I, he's never admitted it to me.

1:47:08.220 --> 1:47:10.514
I don't think he would want me
to see him in that light

1:47:10.514 --> 1:47:14.226
or know those things, that side of him.

1:47:14.852 --> 1:47:16.436
You know, Jahseh...

1:47:20.357 --> 1:47:23.068
was wrong for what he did.

1:47:24.486 --> 1:47:28.282
You know, um, there's no excuse
for that, period.

1:47:28.991 --> 1:47:30.701
You know? But, um...

1:47:32.578 --> 1:47:34.872
I just want the world to know that

1:47:36.081 --> 1:47:38.208
he wasn't that same person anymore

1:47:38.208 --> 1:47:41.837
and that whether it's the past,
it's still a part of his story.

1:47:46.133 --> 1:47:48.552
GENEVA:
Now, Cleo and I are cool.

1:47:49.094 --> 1:47:52.139
It makes me feel like
a weight is lifted basically.

1:47:53.140 --> 1:47:55.934
Because I felt like I wasn't accepted

1:47:55.934 --> 1:47:57.769
by the whole family the whole time.

and I don't think she should
be mistreated in any way.

1:48:09.865 --> 1:48:12.951
This is about his legacy,
and she is the love of his life,

1:48:12.951 --> 1:48:15.120
and she was a part of that legacy.

1:48:19.708 --> 1:48:21.585
GENEVA:
People have, like, asked me for advice,

1:48:21.585 --> 1:48:24.087
and I just feel bad sometimes
'cause, like,

1:48:24.087 --> 1:48:28.133
I don't know how I feel
about telling other people

1:48:28.133 --> 1:48:30.010
what to do or, like,
how to feel about that

1:48:30.010 --> 1:48:31.595
because I feel like it's just different

1:48:31.595 --> 1:48:32.971
with every person.

1:48:35.807 --> 1:48:37.768
SKI:
It's crazy to think that really and truly

1:48:37.768 --> 1:48:39.811
that the end of the story
to Jahseh's legacy

1:48:39.811 --> 1:48:42.439
is going to really help
so many fucking lives.

1:48:45.275 --> 1:48:48.237
So hard to explain, but this
dude turned everything around

1:48:48.237 --> 1:48:49.738
for the better.

1:48:52.157 --> 1:48:54.785
GUY: He set out a parachute
with his name on it.

1:48:55.494 --> 1:48:58.080
I think he wanted to talk about suicide

1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:00.874
and those types of things
to help somebody.

1:49:01.750 --> 1:49:03.252
Really, he wanted to save somebody.

1:49:11.426 --> 1:49:13.095
SKI:
It could go a lot of ways for me,

1:49:13.095 --> 1:49:15.681
but I just know that I have
to make Jahseh proud,

1:49:15.681 --> 1:49:16.890
I have to.

1:49:16.890 --> 1:49:18.308
Because I know I'm going to see him again

1:49:18.308 --> 1:49:20.102
in some cosmic plan.

1:49:20.102 --> 1:49:21.770
Some cosmic plan, I'm gonna see Jah again,

1:49:21.770 --> 1:49:23.856
and that's what I live
my life based off of.

I was going through
a very rough patch in my life.

1:50:55.364 --> 1:50:58.033
His music was able to just help me realize

1:50:58.033 --> 1:51:00.077
that no matter what I'm going through,

1:51:00.077 --> 1:51:01.495
there's always somebody out there

1:51:01.495 --> 1:51:03.247
who feels the same way
and has the same emotions

1:51:03.247 --> 1:51:04.206
that I'm feeling.

1:51:06.416 --> 1:51:07.918
- I looked at him as a mentor.

1:51:07.918 --> 1:51:10.963
I would hit him up for advice
in high school.

1:51:10.963 --> 1:51:14.091
Like, I would hit him up for advice

1:51:14.091 --> 1:51:15.634
if I was going through something,

1:51:15.634 --> 1:51:18.303
and it, he was always there.

1:51:18.303 --> 1:51:20.013
Literally, he was always there.

1:51:22.349 --> 1:51:23.851
- Everybody wants to be
acknowledged, you know.

1:51:23.851 --> 1:51:26.270
And, you know, you get
the occasional thank you

1:51:26.270 --> 1:51:27.896
for the deal and nice whatever, whatever.

1:51:27.896 --> 1:51:30.190
But, you know, our first deal

1:51:30.190 --> 1:51:33.193
which was a seven-figure deal,
he called me up and said,

1:51:33.193 --> 1:51:35.237
"Thank you, you're the reason
my life has changed."

1:51:35.237 --> 1:51:38.824
I'm like, "Okay, that's kind of cool.

1:51:38.824 --> 1:51:40.200
No one's ever said that before."

1:51:45.205 --> 1:51:47.708
- My favorite memory of Jahseh...

1:51:49.501 --> 1:51:52.087
was when it was me,

1:51:52.880 --> 1:51:57.050
my homie VINNY CHANGO$, Ski, and Jah,

1:51:57.050 --> 1:52:00.053
and, like, we played
his music on the radio

1:52:00.053 --> 1:52:01.972
and, like, he, like...

1:52:02.848 --> 1:52:04.850
stood up in the middle of a car,

1:52:04.850 --> 1:52:07.102
like, put his, like, ear mad close

1:52:07.102 --> 1:52:08.395
to, like, to the speaker and was like,

1:52:08.395 --> 1:52:09.897
"Yo, is this me?"

1:52:10.397 --> 1:52:12.024
Like, "Is this me right now?"

1:52:12.024 --> 1:52:13.775
And I'm like, "Bro, this is you."

1:52:13.775 --> 1:52:15.736
And then for, like,
literally the rest of the night,

1:52:15.736 --> 1:52:17.237
I kid you not,

1:52:17.237 --> 1:52:19.990
he just screamed, "This is me!

1:52:19.990 --> 1:52:21.450
"This is me!

1:52:21.450 --> 1:52:22.826
This is me!" For the whole night.

1:52:25.037 --> 1:52:28.207
- So, he's in the studio
doing his thing, I hit record.

1:52:29.708 --> 1:52:31.668
He didn't know I hit record.

1:52:31.668 --> 1:52:34.213
So, I hit record and he's doing
his little thing,

1:52:34.213 --> 1:52:35.756
doing his little thing.

1:52:35.756 --> 1:52:37.549
So, he's like, "All right, I'm ready now."

1:52:37.549 --> 1:52:39.426
So, I just start playing back
what he just did.

1:52:39.426 --> 1:52:41.720
He was like,
"What, what, what, you was recording?"

1:52:41.720 --> 1:52:43.514
I'm like, "Yeah." He was like, "Shit.

1:52:43.514 --> 1:52:45.557
I like this shit. Keep playing it."

1:52:45.557 --> 1:52:46.642
I was like, "All right."

1:52:49.186 --> 1:52:51.730
- He never turned this into a song,
but it was always one of those moments

1:52:51.730 --> 1:52:53.440
that kind of stuck with me.
