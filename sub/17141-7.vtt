WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:07.340
Lots of you guys
have been asking me to sing,

00:07.424 --> 00:09.426
so I know you like my singing.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.969
Obviously.

00:11.053 --> 00:13.972
You wouldn't request it
if you didn't like it, so... [scoffs]

00:14.056 --> 00:17.475
I'm gonna sing a song
for a really big fan who requested it.

00:17.560 --> 00:18.811
This song is for you.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.270
Hope you guys like it.

00:22.981 --> 00:27.277
<i>♪ If you see a faded sign</i>
<i>At the side of the road that says ♪</i>

00:27.360 --> 00:31.364
<i>♪ Fifteen miles to the love shack ♪</i>

00:32.783 --> 00:35.452
<i>♪ Love shack, baby ♪</i>

00:37.871 --> 00:42.876
<i>♪ I'm headin' down the Atlanta highway ♪</i>

00:44.044 --> 00:45.045
[inhales sharply]

00:45.128 --> 00:47.505
-What do you think?
-That was so good.

00:47.590 --> 00:49.925
You're... you're amazing.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.260
My new fan, Patrice, requested it.
[chuckles]

00:52.344 --> 00:53.470
I'm gonna send her a headshot.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.305
Oh, well...

00:56.181 --> 00:57.891
Actually, I re... requested it.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.978
I'm Patrice.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.855
Well, it was a... a typo.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.940
Oh.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.066
Mmm...

01:06.149 --> 01:08.861
Well, who should I make it out to then?
Patrice or Patrick?

01:08.944 --> 01:11.488
-Uh, either one.
-Okay.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.243
How's your arm doing?

01:16.994 --> 01:18.536
Is a scab forming yet?

01:18.621 --> 01:20.372
You stabbed me in the perfect place.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.332
So, it's...
it's healing up nicely.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.334
You're welcome.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.517 --> 01:43.395
Um... Miranda?

01:45.397 --> 01:47.900
There's something, uh...
[clears throat]

01:47.983 --> 01:50.027
[stammering]
that I wanna ask you.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.530
Actually... [stutters] I've been wanting
to ask you for a long time

01:53.614 --> 01:55.157
but I...

01:56.158 --> 01:57.242
[chuckles]

01:58.160 --> 01:59.995
I was wondering if...

02:00.078 --> 02:02.164
if it's not too much trouble...

02:03.206 --> 02:08.544
if you would be open to the idea
of maybe going on a date?

02:11.674 --> 02:12.925
With me.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.095
Why?

02:19.014 --> 02:21.684
[stammers] Um, that's a good question.

02:23.351 --> 02:28.606
Maybe to see if we were compatible
for potential marriage.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.401
Marriage? [scoffs]

02:31.484 --> 02:33.987
Patrick, I'm famous now.
[chuckles]

02:34.071 --> 02:36.281
I can only date and marry famous people.

02:36.364 --> 02:39.409
Plus, you're allergic to milk.
It'll never work.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.414
I understand.

02:45.332 --> 02:49.252
But maybe if...
if you ever change your mind...

02:49.336 --> 02:52.464
You... [sighs]
you could just let me know.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.466
Okay.

03:00.764 --> 03:01.765
[sniffs]

03:02.682 --> 03:04.226
-You can leave now.
-Okay.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.489
[man on TV] <i>You want meat?</i>

03:17.572 --> 03:20.242
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>Order two half-pound patties...</i>

03:22.369 --> 03:24.121
[doctor] Your kidney is failing.

03:25.914 --> 03:29.084
The goal of treatment
is to manage the pain and symptoms.

03:30.794 --> 03:34.214
<i>But with advanced PKD like yours, um...</i>

03:34.297 --> 03:38.593
dialysis, maybe even kidney transplant,
may be necessary.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.053
[breathing heavily]

03:41.764 --> 03:46.601
<i>It... It's important at a time like this</i>
<i>to get support from family and friends.</i>

03:52.607 --> 03:53.734
[sighs]

04:00.949 --> 04:02.075
It'll be okay.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.706
[man on TV] <i>Get the third one free.</i>
<i>That's what I call...</i>

04:09.332 --> 04:12.502
Hello, yes.
I was just looking at your ad online.

04:12.585 --> 04:15.756
It says that you are taking
submissions for an amateur movie.

04:15.839 --> 04:18.550
I manage a girl
who I think would be perfect.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.011
Oh, yes.
Adults will love her.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.888
Uh, now what's it called?

04:23.555 --> 04:26.141
<i>King Kong Seven,</i> uh...

04:26.224 --> 04:28.185
Oh, "Dong," sorry.
I misheard you.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.939
The TV is on very loud here,
so it's hard to hear.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.106
Um, bush?
Let me check.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.859
Miranda, when was the last time
you trimmed your Chia Pet?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.319
This guy wants to know for a movie.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.362
Mmm. It's pretty bushy.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.698
I haven't trimmed it in a while.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.992
Okay, Uncle Jim.
You're gonna wanna hang up on that person.

04:44.076 --> 04:46.328
I think you're right, Emily.
Sir, I'm gonna have to call you back.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.288
The TV is on much too loud here.

04:48.371 --> 04:51.041
Bethany, I can't get any work done
with all that racket.

04:52.417 --> 04:56.338
<i>Are you looking for a mattress</i>
<i>that won't break your back or the bank?</i>

04:56.421 --> 05:00.050
[laughs] <i>Then you need</i>
<i>to get in bed with...</i>

05:00.133 --> 05:02.344
<i>Maureen the Mattress Queen!</i>

05:02.427 --> 05:04.012
I want that crown.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.931
Maureen the Mattress Queen.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.809
Did I ever tell you guys
that we went to high school together?

05:08.892 --> 05:10.268
-Yes.
-Well, I did.

05:10.352 --> 05:13.355
I went to high school with her.
I know her.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.940
Literally,
every time that commercial comes on,

05:15.023 --> 05:16.024
you tell us that you knew her.

05:16.108 --> 05:18.776
And then you make a joke about
how you guys had chemistry together.

05:18.861 --> 05:21.779
We had great chemistry together.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.406
Me and Maureen.

05:24.616 --> 05:27.369
-Chemistry class.
-[chuckles] Good one.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.329
We just had chemistry class together,
guys.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.039
Nothing, nothing...
It was platonic.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.540
[scoffs] Never gets old.

05:32.624 --> 05:35.460
<i>Come see the reason</i>
<i>why I was named the grand marshal</i>

05:35.543 --> 05:37.420
<i>in the town parade</i>
<i>for seven years running.</i>

05:37.504 --> 05:41.258
<i>And come get in bed with</i>
<i>Maureen the Mattress Queen.</i>

05:41.341 --> 05:44.011
What the heck?
How come she gets to be in the parade?

05:44.094 --> 05:46.721
I'm way more famouser than her.
Uncle Jim!

05:46.804 --> 05:49.557
Miranda, you're right.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.186
I just had the perfect idea.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.397
She's got plenty of room
at the top of that float.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.065
We need to go down to the mattress store

05:57.149 --> 05:59.526
and tell her that this year
she gets to have

05:59.609 --> 06:03.530
YouTube sensation Miranda Sings
on her float.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.323
Yes. [sighs]

06:06.366 --> 06:07.993
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.746
-[door opens and closes]
-Mom, I need you to sign this.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.708
-What is it?
-It's just a school thing.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.003
Residential program?

06:18.086 --> 06:20.338
Yep.
And can you just sign right there?

06:20.422 --> 06:22.715
-Well, are you leaving?
-No, it's...

06:24.176 --> 06:25.468
it's, um...

06:27.012 --> 06:28.138
It's for an art school.

06:28.221 --> 06:32.142
Well, it looks like a school
for really talented kids.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.768
I mean, are you sure it's right for you?

06:33.851 --> 06:37.355
[scoffs] Wow.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Mom.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.274
No. I just...

06:39.357 --> 06:41.026
I mean, you don't even know
if you're gonna like it.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.277
I mean, what if it doesn't work out?

06:42.360 --> 06:44.529
Sometimes you have to take a chance.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.531
Do something you've never done before.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.825
Especially if you have nothing to lose
and I mean...

06:48.908 --> 06:50.243
[sighs]

06:50.327 --> 06:53.538
There's not much for me here
now that it's impossible to make friends.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.666
I'm sorry, Emily.
I just...

06:58.376 --> 06:59.669
We need you here.

07:00.670 --> 07:01.754
Okay?

07:06.593 --> 07:07.677
[scoffs]

07:08.386 --> 07:09.554
[sighs]

07:13.141 --> 07:15.978
What the heck?
None of these beds have any sheets.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.895
Does she expect people
to freeze to death at night?

07:17.980 --> 07:19.356
[scoffs] Probably.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.026
-What are you doing?
-Testing the coils.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.528
[grunts]

07:26.571 --> 07:27.864
Oh, that's nice.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.534
[sighs] Yeah. [grunts]

07:31.618 --> 07:32.619
[Maureen] Here's my secret.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.579
This is actually one of my favorite
mattresses in the store.

07:34.662 --> 07:37.624
Miranda, get over here.
I need your help. Lay down.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.709
[grunts and sighs]

07:39.792 --> 07:43.005
No. Get all the way over to the side
like Bethany does.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.922
It'd be really smart to get
the lumbar spine in that...

07:45.007 --> 07:46.549
Actually, sorry.
Can you hold on for a second?

07:46.633 --> 07:48.135
-Really enjoy that.
-[Jim] Oh, yeah.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.719
Look how much room I have.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.221
I want this.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.265
[Maureen clicks tongue]
Well, well, well...

07:53.348 --> 07:55.683
If it isn't little Jimmy,
the flag twirler.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.103
How many times do I have to
tell you, Jimmy?

07:58.186 --> 08:00.022
You cannot loiter in my store.

08:00.105 --> 08:03.483
Actually, today, I am not here
to take a nap, Maureen.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.652
[inhales sharply]
Ooh. You know what?

08:05.735 --> 08:08.738
I better check and make sure
nothing's flammable around here.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.908
Oh, sorry.
Because you burned down our school.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.951
I didn't burn down the school.

08:14.036 --> 08:16.454
Just the gym and the math lab...

08:16.538 --> 08:18.040
and part of the science building.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.250
-Yeah. That's it.
-That's it.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.044
I heard you got fired from your fish job,

08:22.127 --> 08:23.795
and now you're following
your little niece around.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.006
-Look who's talking.
-What?

08:26.089 --> 08:28.091
You don't even have a niece.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.177
Ooh, burn! [chuckles]

08:30.260 --> 08:31.469
-Burn.
-Good one.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.388
Family tree burn.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.847
I don't have time for a niece. Okay?

08:35.932 --> 08:37.475
I'm a queen.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.936
I'm a grand marshal and I'm a goddess.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.523
Okay. But are you a singer, dancer,
actor, model, magician?

08:43.606 --> 08:44.607
[inhales sharply]

08:44.691 --> 08:47.194
Uh, what are you doing in my store, Jim?

08:47.277 --> 08:48.403
Okay. I'll tell you.

08:48.486 --> 08:52.407
I'm going to let you put
YouTube sensation Miranda Sings

08:52.490 --> 08:55.535
on top of your float
in exchange for...

08:55.618 --> 08:58.371
this mattress and some sheets.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.040
-And a pillow.
-And a pillow.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.127
Going once, going twice--

09:04.211 --> 09:06.213
Uh, Miranda, I will handle this.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.257
-[clears throat] Going once, go--
-Let it go, Jim.

09:09.341 --> 09:13.636
You're not getting a mattress
and she's not going on my float, okay?

09:13.720 --> 09:15.888
What?
What a rip off.

09:15.972 --> 09:20.143
You know what? You're worse at negotiating
than you are at ribbon dancing.

09:20.893 --> 09:24.522
[scoffs] Maureen,
you may be a mattress queen...

09:25.440 --> 09:30.070
but you have no idea what I can do
with 20 feet of ribbon.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.447
They stopped me before the finale.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.700
It would have been incredible.

09:35.783 --> 09:39.121
Oh, sweetie. No.
Nothing you do is incredible.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.248
-That's not true.
-Literally nothing.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.208
-Yeah, nothing.
-I have a niece.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.376
Yeah, he's got me. Hello? [scoffs]

09:45.460 --> 09:46.544
-Sweetie?
-Mmm-hmm?

09:46.628 --> 09:48.088
You, too, a little hint...

09:50.006 --> 09:51.174
Get a new uncle.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.595
-[softly] Don't tell--
-Get out of my store.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.516
-Stop it.
-Stop it.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.850
Out of my store.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.060
-You get out of your... store... My store.
-Yeah. You go.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.604
You get out of your store.

10:05.897 --> 10:08.191
Or you get a... you get another store.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.528
-[Jim] Go get another store.
-Go!

10:26.668 --> 10:27.669
[Keith] Hi, Bethany.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.381
Keith, hi.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.425
Yeah, it's been a while.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.969
I stayed away out of respect.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.806
But I can't stop thinking about you, so...

10:40.723 --> 10:43.851
I figured I'd come
and disrespect my respect.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.102
[chuckles]

10:46.396 --> 10:48.064
Do you have your loyalty card?

10:51.443 --> 10:55.197
Actually,
I have this coupon for the burn cream

10:55.280 --> 10:59.116
that this beautiful woman gave me once.

10:59.201 --> 11:02.162
So, I figured I'd come down and redeem it.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.122
It's expired.

11:07.124 --> 11:09.669
That's all right.
I'll pay retail. [chuckles]

11:09.752 --> 11:11.213
-Okay.
-Yeah.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.673
-[beeps]
-It's $12.99.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.718
Actually, I'm just gonna get the bagels.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.010
-Uh...
-Oh.

11:18.094 --> 11:21.097
You guys, uh, ran out of plain, so...

11:21.180 --> 11:23.391
I had to go with the jalapeño.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.768
Sometimes you got to try something new.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.192
Yeah.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.444
You do.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.741
You know, Keith, um...

11:39.824 --> 11:44.662
I think there might be another coupon
in the back.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.086
What?

11:52.169 --> 11:53.546
[both exclaim and chuckle]

11:53.630 --> 11:55.965
-[moans] Wow.
-[chuckles] This is so exciting.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.175
Mmm-hmm. I've been waiting for this,
my broken dove.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.345
-Oh.
-[moaning]

12:00.428 --> 12:03.139
Oh, oh... uh, you don't have on
your wrist brace.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.432
-No.
-What?

12:04.516 --> 12:06.559
[stutters] Wait, I can go out there
and buy you one right now.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.978
-A new sling if you want.
-No. I don't need any of that.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.565
You know, you do seem healthy.
[chuckles]

12:12.649 --> 12:13.900
-Do I?
-Yeah.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.193
Thank you. You know what?
'Cause I feel good.

12:16.278 --> 12:17.737
-Mmm. Oh--
-So good.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.906
-What?
-No, I am needed back at the church.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.198
-Oh!
-[chuckles] Yeah.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.451
[stammers] It was really good
bumping into you...

12:23.535 --> 12:24.786
-Yeah.
-...like this. [chuckles]

12:24.869 --> 12:26.788
Well, when could we bump
into each other again?

12:26.871 --> 12:28.373
-Uh...
-Are you going to the parade?

12:28.456 --> 12:31.793
[stuttering] Uh, I am. And I'll...
I'll probably see you there.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.628
-Okay. Right.
-[chuckling] Right?

12:33.711 --> 12:35.838
-[breathing heavily] Okeydokey.
-Okeydokey.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.089
Okay. [chuckles]

12:46.599 --> 12:47.600
This is ridiculous.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.394
How come she gets to be
the freaking grand marshal?

12:49.477 --> 12:51.228
Yeah.
Did you hear the stuff she said to me?

12:51.313 --> 12:54.065
She has no idea
how I was gonna finish that pep rally.

12:54.148 --> 12:57.652
I was gonna end it with a dance move
that no one has successfully completed.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.153
The liberty twirl.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.447
You know, she's not even a real celebrity.

13:00.530 --> 13:03.074
Has she done the Five Phases of Fame?
[scoffs] I doubt it.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.826
She's gonna be on the news and everything.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.745
-This is so not fair!
-Miranda, just stay calm!

13:07.829 --> 13:08.913
You need to do something.

13:08.996 --> 13:11.958
I am gonna put together
a top-notch color guard unit.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.751
That'll show her.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.337
Color guard?

13:15.420 --> 13:16.838
-What does that have to do with anything?
-Oh, well.

13:16.921 --> 13:20.633
Uh, uh... we need a color guard
to clear the way and lead you

13:20.717 --> 13:23.302
to the front of the parade,
where you belong.

13:23.386 --> 13:26.013
Ah, now it all makes sense.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.266
Finally,
I'll be at the front of the parade

13:29.351 --> 13:32.019
instead of the back
with all the freakin' homeschoolers.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.771
The homeschoolers?

13:33.855 --> 13:35.231
This is perfect.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.943
Miranda, we just found our color guard.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.029
Who?

13:42.864 --> 13:44.782
The homeschoolers.

13:44.866 --> 13:47.201
Okay. Okay, well, it's...
Can you please stop?

13:47.284 --> 13:49.704
I'm starving and there's only
half a bottle left.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.209
[Miranda] All right.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.711
Would you like one scoop or two?

13:56.794 --> 13:59.046
No scoops, thank you.

14:00.423 --> 14:01.674
You are so weird.

14:01.758 --> 14:05.428
Oh, there we go.
I'm just gonna plop this in here.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.971
Oh, a surprise plop.
Lucky you.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.391
I'll get you some of the crusty edge.

14:11.476 --> 14:12.644
Oh, hold on.

14:12.727 --> 14:15.480
Some of the crust
is stuck to the spoon.

14:15.563 --> 14:19.609
On behalf of myself and the entire
Tacoma Harvest Homeschoolers Group,

14:19.692 --> 14:23.905
we'd like to thank you for taking interest
in our parade activities this year.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.115
We're so happy
you're getting more involved.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.117
Oh, well.
That's what I do best.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.495
I make people happy. So...

14:30.578 --> 14:31.579
[Jim clears throat]

14:34.040 --> 14:35.417
Hello, homeschoolers.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.545
I am giving you
the opportunity of a lifetime.

14:38.628 --> 14:43.215
A chance to be a member
of my elite color guard unit.

14:44.341 --> 14:48.345
Oh, well, we already have plans.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.722
You already have plans?

14:49.806 --> 14:52.183
Yeah. Over here are some examples

14:52.266 --> 14:54.351
of some past parade banners
that we've made.

14:54.436 --> 14:55.937
Wait, what is this?
Banners?

14:56.020 --> 14:58.440
-[Abigail] Over here are some swatches.
-Swatches? That's--

14:58.523 --> 15:01.401
-[Abigail] Font styles.
-Fonts?

15:01.484 --> 15:05.112
And historical inspirations
we can use for this year's banner.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.740
Abigail, put that binder away.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.451
[chuckles]

15:09.534 --> 15:11.869
I'm sorry.
Mom gave me a B-plus on it.

15:11.953 --> 15:15.164
So, I guess
I was just being a little bit prideful.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.167
-[Jim chuckles] You got a B-plus on that?
-Ew!

15:18.250 --> 15:20.294
That's garbage, Abigail.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.923
You should be homeschooled
by another mother.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.050
Now, listen up, people.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.511
Flag waving is more than
just waving flags.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.347
There are five phases to becoming
an elite flag waver.

15:31.431 --> 15:35.685
Visualization, grip, dazzle, song choice,

15:35.768 --> 15:39.188
dance moves, precision
and facial expressions.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.315
[sighs] Was that five?

15:41.398 --> 15:43.192
Yeah, that was five.
I think. Definitely.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.027
[Jim] That was five.
We're saying that was five.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.822
-Patrick, yes.
-Can I try?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.742
[chuckling] Oh!
You want to try, huh?

15:50.825 --> 15:53.285
[stutters] No warm-up.
No demonstration.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.162
You want to give it a whirl?
Okay.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.831
Uh, come on, Patrick.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.542
[chuckles] This will be good.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.004
Here's a flag.
This is the... Called the flag.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.965
This is the pole.
This is the part you... hold onto. Go.

16:06.048 --> 16:09.093
[laughs] See how you can do it,
Mr. Know-it-all.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.641
[exhales sharply]

16:17.477 --> 16:18.478
[grunts]

16:24.692 --> 16:25.735
[Jim] Wrong!

16:25.818 --> 16:29.071
Wrong. All wrong. Give me that.
No, all wrong.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.239
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just... I just--

16:30.322 --> 16:32.033
Those were just some sword flourishes

16:32.116 --> 16:34.744
that I thought would translate nicely
to the flags. But...

16:34.827 --> 16:36.120
-Uh, but they didn't.
-I know.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.582
-I thought it was all right.
-No. Take a seat.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.960
Oh, sure, it looked okay,

16:43.044 --> 16:46.172
but there's a lot more to performing
than how well you do it.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.091
I mean, he just jumped right in there
without any warm-ups.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.718
That's sloppy.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.970
Now, any of you other smart alecks
want to give it a try?

16:54.471 --> 16:55.682
No.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.224
Then watch the master at work.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.393
[inhales sharply]

17:07.151 --> 17:08.528
[Jim grunting]

17:11.823 --> 17:13.074
[continues grunting]

17:18.494 --> 17:22.124
Style and substance.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.375
Miranda, you're up next.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.920
Ugh! I don't want to wave
a stupid flag.

17:26.002 --> 17:27.714
I want to ride a horse.
I told you that.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.633
You can't ride a horse!
Horses get spooked by flags.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.801
And then they kick a little kid.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.595
And then the little kid
with a smashed-in face...

17:33.678 --> 17:35.429
Then his mother's mad
and the mother won't go out with you.

17:35.512 --> 17:38.307
-And it's a whole deal.
-Hmm, okay.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.268
Oh, what if ride you on the daddy saddle
through the parade?

17:41.352 --> 17:42.729
No. I have to ribbon dance!

17:43.855 --> 17:47.149
I mean, so I can lead you
to the front of the parade,

17:47.233 --> 17:50.570
where you belong,
on your, uh, float.

17:50.653 --> 17:51.738
[gasps] A float?

17:51.821 --> 17:54.365
[chuckles]
Patrick, make Miranda a float.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.996
I'll build you the exact float
you're hoping for, Miranda.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.374
Okay. [chuckles]
Well, it better actually float, though.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.631
Patrick, you are dismissed.
You are not cut out for this.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.048
Excused.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.844
-[sighs] Oh, I have a question.
-Yes.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.553
May I please leave?
This is very boring.

18:16.638 --> 18:18.430
Uh, my presentation is boring?

18:18.514 --> 18:19.974
No, they are very boring.
Look at them.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.435
-But flag waving is not boring?
-You said it, not me.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.147
-Yes, you may leave.
-Okay, thank you.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.735
[Bethany]
You should go for it.

18:32.319 --> 18:35.031
-What?
-The art school.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.617
I don't want you to give up on
something that you really want to do.

18:42.413 --> 18:45.374
Wow. Thank you.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.709
Mmm-hmm.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.089
Do you want to see
what I've been working on?

18:53.049 --> 18:54.634
I was gonna take a nap.

18:58.429 --> 19:02.099
Uh, yes.
I would like that.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.605
-[sighs]
-Oh, my goodness.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.441
[gasps] Wow!

19:12.443 --> 19:13.861
Look at all this.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.699
Uh, well... uh, what do you think?

19:19.616 --> 19:21.786
Oh, I... I really like this one.

19:23.037 --> 19:24.789
Yeah, that's my favorite, too.

19:24.872 --> 19:28.668
Yeah? It's so... hopeful.

19:28.751 --> 19:29.836
What's it called?

19:30.837 --> 19:32.046
<i>The Never-Ending Abyss.</i>

19:33.840 --> 19:34.966
[Bethany] Oh.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.719
I thought it was a hat.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.595
[Emily inhales sharply]

19:42.639 --> 19:44.266
This doesn't even look like a float.

19:44.350 --> 19:47.103
How are we going to beat
Maureen the Mattress Queen in this?

19:47.186 --> 19:50.147
Well, it isn't exactly finished,
but we should practice driving

19:50.231 --> 19:52.233
because I won't be able to see
when I'm inside it.

19:52.316 --> 19:53.776
Okay, fine.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.826
You should probably hold on
so you don't fall off.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.160
Oh, okay.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.836
What I'm about to do is for your safety.
I respect your honor.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.301
[faint growling]

20:19.385 --> 20:21.595
-Your tummy's growling.
-Sorry.

20:21.678 --> 20:24.098
-Do you have gas?
-Maybe. I'm nervous.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.144
-Then I won't squeeze too hard.
-Thank you.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.688
[exhales sharply]

20:31.773 --> 20:34.859
So I was thinking about that date...

20:34.942 --> 20:37.069
Patrick, I told you that's impossible.

20:37.153 --> 20:38.279
-[sighs]
-Go!

20:39.196 --> 20:43.826
Well, I was thinking that maybe
if I listed some of my qualities,

20:43.910 --> 20:45.411
that would help with your decision.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.747
One, gentleman.
Two, protector.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.666
-Three, I can make my own soap.
-Oh, watch out, there's a dog!

20:52.168 --> 20:53.419
Just kidding!

20:53.502 --> 20:54.711
Got you good.

20:55.629 --> 20:56.756
Good one.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.261
[singsong] Hello.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.305
[clicks tongue and inhales]

21:04.388 --> 21:08.350
So... Mom tells me
that you're painting a lot more lately.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.352
I think that's really great.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.814
-You do?
-Mmm-hmm. I just said so.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.108
Yeah, I was really excited
to hear about it

21:16.192 --> 21:18.277
'cause it means that
you can paint my float for me.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.695
[sighs] There it is.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.281
So you need to be done by the morning,
or else you're fired.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.784
Okay, Miranda, I'm not helping you.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.870
What? Why not?
You're not even doing anything.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.872
Actually, I'm putting together
my portfolio

21:29.956 --> 21:31.332
to try to get into art school.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.792
Okay?

21:32.875 --> 21:34.836
-I can't screw this up.
-Mmm...

21:35.962 --> 21:36.963
Ai! [snorts]

21:37.046 --> 21:38.214
Well,
now that I'm looking at your pictures,

21:38.297 --> 21:39.924
I don't really want you to paint my float.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.092
No offense. [chuckles]

21:41.175 --> 21:43.510
You're just not very good, so...

21:43.594 --> 21:45.930
See you later, alligator.

21:46.848 --> 21:47.974
Mmm...

21:50.852 --> 21:53.395
Okay. Just... this is
a really horrible door.

21:53.479 --> 21:54.772
[Emily] Just leave it.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.073
Well, are you sure you don't want me
to go with you?

22:04.156 --> 22:05.574
No, I am fine.
Thank you.

22:06.783 --> 22:10.412
Okay, well...
I think I'll go to the parade then.

22:10.496 --> 22:11.538
[Emily] Better hurry.

22:11.622 --> 22:13.833
Miranda's gonna need someone to blame
when she ruins everything

22:13.916 --> 22:15.376
and she's gonna be looking for you.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.795
Well, I hope she's not the only one
looking for me.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.718
-I'm talking about Keith.
-What?

22:25.677 --> 22:28.973
Mom, you can't go back to Keith.
He has a weird fetish for sick people.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.017
Oh, that is nonsense.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.643
Yesterday, he said I looked healthy

22:32.726 --> 22:34.478
when we were making out
in the grocery store.

22:34.561 --> 22:37.439
-We went by the supply closet and--
-Hey, Mom, stop.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.566
This is something
we really need to talk about.

22:39.650 --> 22:42.153
-I--
-No, no. We can talk later.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.530
You should go on your interview.
It's too important.

22:44.613 --> 22:45.822
[softly] Go.

22:48.534 --> 22:49.701
Okay, yeah.

I'm really proud of you.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.624
Thanks. Bye.

22:56.417 --> 22:59.086
Go get 'em! Is that what you say for art?

23:46.217 --> 23:47.426
There she is.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.892
It's time to rewrite history, kids.

23:56.978 --> 23:58.020
Now!

24:03.067 --> 24:04.401
Hit it, Patrick!

In your face!

24:39.770 --> 24:41.230
We did it, Patrick!
We did it!

24:41.313 --> 24:42.398
We did it?

24:42.481 --> 24:44.608
We did it!
We did it! [laughs]

24:45.692 --> 24:48.112
This is the worst day of my life, Sean!

24:48.195 --> 24:49.196
Giddy up!

24:50.114 --> 24:51.865
Sean! This is...

24:53.284 --> 24:55.869
Get out of the car
and pick up my crown, Sean.

Thank you all!
I'm such a blessing to be here today.

[Jim] All right.
Let's show 'em what we got! [panting]

I thought we were enemies

[scoffs] You're so weird.

28:08.395 --> 28:10.188
I may be weird,

I can kind of swim through it.

and nobody else's
