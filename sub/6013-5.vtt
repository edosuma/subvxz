00:01.293 --> 00:03.002
Went out to dinner

00:01.293 --> 00:03.002
the other night.

00:03.002 --> 00:05.631
Check came at the end

00:03.002 --> 00:05.631
of the meal, as it always does.

00:05.631 --> 00:08.467
Never liked the "check

00:05.631 --> 00:08.467
at the end of the meal" system,

00:08.467 --> 00:10.385
'cause money's

00:08.467 --> 00:10.385
a very different thing

00:10.385 --> 00:11.595
before and after you eat.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.263
Before you eat,

00:11.595 --> 00:13.263
money has no value.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.557
You don't care about money

00:13.263 --> 00:15.557
when you're hungry.

00:15.557 --> 00:17.142
You sit down

00:15.557 --> 00:17.142
in a restaurant,

00:17.142 --> 00:19.728
you're like the ruler

00:17.142 --> 00:19.728
of an empire-- More drinks!

00:19.728 --> 00:21.146
Appetizers!

00:21.146 --> 00:22.982
Quickly, quickly.

00:22.982 --> 00:26.777
It will be the greatest meal

00:22.982 --> 00:26.777
of our lives.

00:26.777 --> 00:29.112
Then after the meal, you know,

00:29.112 --> 00:33.701
you got the pants open,

00:29.112 --> 00:33.701
you got the napkins destroyed,

00:33.701 --> 00:35.828
cigarette butt

00:33.701 --> 00:35.828
in the mashed potatoes.

00:35.828 --> 00:38.664
Then the check comes

00:35.828 --> 00:38.664
at that moment.

00:38.664 --> 00:41.375
People are always upset,

00:38.664 --> 00:41.375
you know.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.752
They're mystified by the check.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.752
They're...

00:44.837 --> 00:46.505
"What is this?

00:47.673 --> 00:49.299
How could this be?"

00:49.299 --> 00:51.510
They start passing it

00:49.299 --> 00:51.510
around the table.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.846
"Does this look right to you?

00:54.847 --> 00:56.557

Why are we buying

00:56.557 --> 00:58.767
all this food?"

01:02.312 --> 01:04.481
Well, I think Superman

01:04.481 --> 01:07.275
probably has

01:04.481 --> 01:07.275
a very good sense of humor.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.611
I never heard him say

01:07.275 --> 01:09.611
anything really funny.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.196
But it's common sense.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.741
He's got super strength,

01:11.196 --> 01:13.741
super speed.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.784
I'm sure he's got super humor.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.327
You'd think that, but...

01:17.327 --> 01:19.580
either you're born with

01:17.327 --> 01:19.580
a sense of humor or you're not.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.956
It's not gonna change.

Ehh...

01:25.502 --> 01:27.462
Why?

01:27.462 --> 01:29.506
Why would that one area

of his mind

01:29.506 --> 01:33.010
not be affected by

01:29.506 --> 01:33.010

Whew.

01:42.937 --> 01:45.522

They're very clean animals.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.593
I gotta say, that's pretty bad,

20:19.593 --> 20:21.554
losing out to a cat.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.807
Almost as bad

20:21.554 --> 20:24.807
as losing out to a perfume.

[ELAINE LAUGHS]

20:28.186 --> 20:31.355
Told you those trips

20:28.186 --> 20:31.355
are relationship-killers.

20:32.690 --> 20:35.193
Too bad you can't get

20:32.690 --> 20:35.193
your buddy Superman

20:35.193 --> 20:37.236
to fly around

20:35.193 --> 20:37.236
the Earth

20:37.236 --> 20:40.031
at super speed

20:37.236 --> 20:40.031
and reverse time.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.199
Get all the money back,

20:41.199 --> 20:42.282
could have avoided

20:42.282 --> 20:43.910
the whole trip

20:42.282 --> 20:43.910
to Vermont...

20:43.910 --> 20:45.786
Superman can go back in time?

20:45.786 --> 20:47.830
We went over that.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.582
Psst...

20:55.379 --> 20:57.673
Wilkenson's got a bite

20:55.379 --> 20:57.673
on a new one...

20:59.341 --> 21:01.719
The Tramco Corporation.

21:01.719 --> 21:05.014
Out of, uh...

21:01.719 --> 21:05.014
Springfield, I think.

21:06.682 --> 21:11.812
They're about to introduce

21:06.682 --> 21:11.812
some sort of a robot butcher.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.190
A robot butcher?

21:14.190 --> 21:16.067
Shh...

[CLEARS THROAT]

21:18.236 --> 21:20.320

21:32.625 --> 21:35.044

Just let me...peek.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.934
Good.

21:51.185 --> 21:53.187
Come on!

21:51.185 --> 21:53.187
Come on, come on, come on...

21:53.187 --> 21:54.605
I'm not an investor.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.107
People always tell me:

21:56.107 --> 21:58.276
"You should have your money

21:56.107 --> 21:58.276
working for you."

21:58.276 --> 22:01.528
I've decided I'll do the work,

21:58.276 --> 22:01.528
I'm gonna let the money relax.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.156
You know what I mean?

22:03.156 --> 22:05.283
'Cause you send your money

22:03.156 --> 22:05.283
out there, working for you,

22:05.283 --> 22:07.534
a lot of times, it gets fired.

22:07.534 --> 22:09.203
You go back there,

22:07.534 --> 22:09.203
"What happened?

22:09.203 --> 22:11.247
I had my money, it was here,

22:09.203 --> 22:11.247
it was working for me."

22:11.247 --> 22:14.083
"Yeah, I remember

22:11.247 --> 22:14.083
your money.

22:14.083 --> 22:17.503
Showing up late,

22:14.083 --> 22:17.503
taking time off...
