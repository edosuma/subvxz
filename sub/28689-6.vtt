02:14.995 --> 02:17.435
What's the matter, Patrizia?

02:20.435 --> 02:25.033
Nothing.
I'm sad you're leaving.

02:25.035 --> 02:29.113
I won't be away long,
I have to run an errand in Modena.

02:29.115 --> 02:31.915
- My father ordered me to do it.
- I know.

02:36.395 --> 02:39.155
Are you sure that's all it is?

02:43.155 --> 02:45.913
I'm scared they want to fuck me over.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.275
Who?

02:49.155 --> 02:50.875
I don't know.

02:53.235 --> 02:56.275
Nicola was one of the few
who knew about the shipment.

02:58.075 --> 03:00.115
Do you think it was him?

03:02.595 --> 03:04.475
I can't believe it.

03:06.995 --> 03:11.033
To get the cops mixed up in it,
you need to know people.

03:11.035 --> 03:13.155
You need to be powerful.

03:19.155 --> 03:21.315
Who else knew about the shipment?

03:26.195 --> 03:28.075
All the allied families.

03:34.555 --> 03:37.155
It's going to be all right, just relax.

03:40.555 --> 03:45.073
But do me a favor: stay at home
for the next few days, while I'm away.

03:45.075 --> 03:47.513
I'll feel easier if you did.

03:47.515 --> 03:49.795
- I'll go get ready.
- Okay.

04:40.555 --> 04:43.433
- Well?
- They're not talking about this raid.

04:43.435 --> 04:45.593
I only heard one thing.

04:45.595 --> 04:48.953
- But it's a rumor.
- Spit it out, I'll pay you.

04:48.955 --> 04:52.593
- Not all the drugs made it to storage.
- What?

04:52.595 --> 04:55.073
A big whack of it
has gone back onto the street.

04:55.075 --> 04:57.633
How do I get to it?

04:57.635 --> 04:59.635
Call this number.

05:49.475 --> 05:51.315
Mamma.

05:55.795 --> 05:58.873
- How do you feel?
- I'm fine, don't worry.

05:58.875 --> 06:02.233
- You've taken your medication?
- Yes, sir, don't worry.

06:02.235 --> 06:05.273
- Which did you take?
- That one...

06:05.275 --> 06:08.913
The one with the red cap,
with the English name.

06:08.915 --> 06:10.793
Did you taken the bleomycin?

06:10.795 --> 06:13.713
I have a doctor in the house
and I never knew it!

06:13.715 --> 06:16.433
You have to take it three times a day:

06:16.435 --> 06:20.753
morning, afternoon and night.

06:20.755 --> 06:24.755
Here. Hold out your hand.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.473
There you go.

06:27.475 --> 06:29.073
Uncle.

06:29.075 --> 06:32.793
Paoletto has to get his vaccination
shot, I have to go to school.

06:32.795 --> 06:35.635
- Where's your mamma?
- Sleeping, should I wake her?

06:37.515 --> 06:39.235
I'll do it.

06:43.955 --> 06:46.075
It's Linuccio, go let him in.

06:50.675 --> 06:54.233
Get up. It's late.

06:54.235 --> 06:57.393
- Serena, get up.
- Cut it out, Nicola.

06:57.395 --> 06:59.873
Paoletto needs his vaccination.

06:59.875 --> 07:02.793
And here he is... I'll do what I want.

07:02.795 --> 07:05.553
My ass! Get up!
I'll give you two minutes.

07:05.555 --> 07:08.553
- Go away, get out!
- I'll break your legs, get up!

07:08.555 --> 07:09.995
Fuck off!

07:13.475 --> 07:15.913
The situation's not good.

07:15.915 --> 07:18.353
The seized drugs
are back into circulation.

07:18.355 --> 07:22.515
Whoever's behind this
is very powerful, he owns some cops.

07:24.835 --> 07:28.033
What are you gonna do?

07:28.035 --> 07:31.473
It was you and me in there,
we're the only ones who got out.

07:31.475 --> 07:35.353
She thinks it was me
and so she suspects you, too.

07:35.355 --> 07:39.113
We gotta figure out who it was,
we gotta bring her proof.

07:39.115 --> 07:42.955
That's the only way we can sleep easy,
us and our families.

07:46.515 --> 07:48.075
So?

07:49.595 --> 07:51.315
What are we gonna do?

07:53.755 --> 07:55.875
I got a contact.

07:57.515 --> 07:59.755
We gotta go today.

08:07.235 --> 08:08.995
Hi, Serena.

08:56.955 --> 09:00.115
We wanna see Kevin,
we need to talk to him.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.593
- Are you Nicola?
- Yeah.

09:03.595 --> 09:05.315
- And him?
- He's my cousin.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.793
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

09:09.795 --> 09:11.475
Come.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.593
Know who that is?

09:44.595 --> 09:47.193
That's Mister Antonio,
an ex-traffic cop.

09:47.195 --> 09:50.673
He began doing our accounts
and later he left his wife.

09:50.675 --> 09:52.713
Just think!

09:52.715 --> 09:57.273
Bro', people shoot their mouths off,
but everyone likes cocaine.

09:57.275 --> 10:00.315
And black pussy!

10:12.466 --> 10:14.333
It's all good, it's all good.

10:14.335 --> 10:15.295
They're with me.

11:36.845 --> 11:38.430
Greetings, Papa Gyan.

11:38.432 --> 11:40.049
These are the friends
I talked to you about.

12:21.435 --> 12:24.713
We'll take a kilo, to start.

12:24.715 --> 12:27.875
Obviously we'll pay in cash
and you name the price.

12:37.155 --> 12:38.633
What did he say?

12:38.635 --> 12:41.073
He said it's all good,
but he has a question.

12:41.075 --> 12:44.833
- You're from Secondigliano, right?
- Right.

12:44.835 --> 12:49.273
How come you want coke from us?
Yours is better.

12:49.275 --> 12:51.993
Or has something happened
that we don't know about?

12:51.995 --> 12:55.475
I'm fed up, I want to make
some money on my own.

13:01.275 --> 13:03.435
Tell him he can trust me.

13:04.635 --> 13:06.553
We'll start like this,

13:06.555 --> 13:08.913
then when you know we have the money

13:08.915 --> 13:11.353
you can introduce us
to whoever sold it to you,

13:11.355 --> 13:14.195
and we can do
some good business together.

13:23.835 --> 13:26.795
Obviously we'll pay you
for your trouble.

13:45.475 --> 13:46.795
We'll let you know.

13:51.629 --> 13:53.913
Papa Gyan, with all due respect.

13:53.915 --> 13:55.715
Guys, let's go.

15:02.955 --> 15:05.115
What brings you to Forcella?

15:06.195 --> 15:09.713
I heard something
that might interest you.

15:09.715 --> 15:11.115
What is it?

15:12.395 --> 15:15.435
The cocaine from the raid
is back on the streets.

15:19.715 --> 15:23.273
- How's that possible?
- I'm trying to figure it out.

15:23.275 --> 15:26.793
So, why didn't your boss come
and tell us directly?

15:26.795 --> 15:29.633
Because things are going badly for us

15:29.635 --> 15:33.433
and I don't want Patrizia to think
I wanna fuck her over.

15:33.435 --> 15:36.715
If what I think is true,
there's someone behind it.

15:37.995 --> 15:41.313
- Who do you think it is?
- I'm thinking someone big.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.795
Someone who doesn't want
this alliance anymore.

15:45.195 --> 15:48.873
Us, together,

15:48.875 --> 15:51.633
we gotta stop him.

15:51.635 --> 15:55.313
As far as I can tell,
the problem's yours.

15:55.315 --> 15:58.075
- Not ours.
- That's true.

15:59.795 --> 16:04.353
But what happens to me today,
could happen to you tomorrow.

16:04.355 --> 16:06.875
When it happens to us,
we'll take care of it.

16:08.315 --> 16:10.035
Don't worry.

16:31.275 --> 16:33.713
What's wrong, Valerio?

16:33.715 --> 16:36.795
- You got a problem?
- No, no problem.

16:38.075 --> 16:40.915
Even though you don't say it,
I know what you think.

16:42.395 --> 16:45.553
Then, you also know where we stand.

16:45.555 --> 16:48.313
Selling pills to kids to get by.

16:48.315 --> 16:51.393
- We'll wait for Patrizia's shipment.
- It won't be long.

16:51.395 --> 16:55.595
- That's what she said.
- What do you mean? I don't get you.

16:58.115 --> 17:00.995
The raid's been harmful for us, too.

17:02.155 --> 17:05.395
What if Nicola's right?
If there's someone behind it?

17:11.355 --> 17:14.873
There was an emperor
called Julius Caesar.

17:14.875 --> 17:17.433
Know what he said?

17:17.435 --> 17:21.155
When your enemy's after you,
you have to be one step ahead.

17:27.875 --> 17:29.755
Tell me something, Valerio.

17:34.955 --> 17:38.955
Did the emperor have a <i>consigliori</i>
who wanted to take his place?

17:40.115 --> 17:44.313
Because maybe Nicola wants
to swipe Patrizia's place.

17:44.315 --> 17:48.115
- Let's tell Patrizia.
- We'll mind our own fucking business!

17:56.355 --> 17:58.915
You still don't get how it works here.

18:01.155 --> 18:04.913
You gotta mind your own business
and keep your head down.

18:04.915 --> 18:06.955
You can't trust anyone.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.395
Enzo...

18:12.715 --> 18:15.835
When I met you
I saw something in you...

18:17.595 --> 18:19.955
but I don't see it anymore.

18:58.870 --> 19:00.230
Kevin?

19:02.230 --> 19:05.228
We don't need time,
I got the money already.

19:05.230 --> 19:07.230
Cool, I'll see you tonight.

19:08.750 --> 19:10.748
We're doing the handover.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.108
He got the name
of who sold them the coke?

19:13.110 --> 19:16.268
- Yes, but he wants 10 grand more.
- We gotta negotiate.

19:16.270 --> 19:19.868
This money's peanuts,
surely our life's worth 10 grand.

19:19.870 --> 19:21.870
You trust them?

19:24.950 --> 19:26.430
Come up, Lino.

19:33.710 --> 19:35.270
Good morning.

19:38.590 --> 19:40.308
- How much is it?
- 35.

19:40.310 --> 19:41.868
You made less this week?

19:41.870 --> 19:45.110
If you come on Thursday
and not Saturday, it's obvious.

19:46.670 --> 19:49.030
Goodbye.

20:00.110 --> 20:03.188
When Patrizia finds out
we took Berlingeri's money...

20:03.190 --> 20:06.548
When she finds out who wants
to screw her, she won't mind.

20:06.550 --> 20:10.068
And if it doesn't go like you say?
If it goes wrong?

20:10.070 --> 20:14.228
Why don't we talk to Patrizia?
We'll explain it all to her.

20:14.230 --> 20:16.948
- She'll understand.
- Lino...

20:16.950 --> 20:19.468
We have to bring Patrizia a name.

20:19.470 --> 20:22.510
We need to figure out who it was,
trust me.

20:23.550 --> 20:25.430
It's all good.

20:26.550 --> 20:29.190
It's you and me, we'll cream them!

20:37.110 --> 20:38.708
All done?

20:38.710 --> 20:40.508
Very good...

20:40.510 --> 20:42.788
Good, huh?

20:42.790 --> 20:45.630
- Almost like in Naples.
- Let's say that...

21:05.070 --> 21:07.908
What are you doing here?
I'm working.

21:07.910 --> 21:10.870
- I don't want to see you anymore.
- I'm pregnant.

21:21.310 --> 21:23.270
And what do you want from me?

21:25.190 --> 21:28.830
I need to ask something
only you can tell me.

21:31.990 --> 21:34.470
What kind of mother would I be?

21:37.950 --> 21:40.590
The worst in the world.

21:55.390 --> 21:58.230
You smell like Mamma's hair.

22:06.430 --> 22:10.350
- You still remember it?
- I can't forget it.

22:14.110 --> 22:16.510
Alessio, what should I do?

22:17.630 --> 22:21.150
If the kid's going to end up like us,
forget about it.

23:41.710 --> 23:44.110
Nicola!

24:04.590 --> 24:06.990
Lino!

24:08.230 --> 24:10.548
- You found us.
- Pieces of shit! What have you done?

24:10.550 --> 24:12.228
- Shut up.
- You're shit!

24:12.230 --> 24:14.548
Shut up or I'll shoot you in the mouth!

24:14.550 --> 24:17.188
- So shoot me!
- Shut the fuck up.

24:17.190 --> 24:22.228
- Shoot!
- We need you alive.

24:22.230 --> 24:24.788
Now listen to me good.

24:24.790 --> 24:29.668
Your boss is a whore, she's not capable
of running the alliance.

24:29.670 --> 24:32.108
A woman can't be in charge
of Secondigliano,

24:32.110 --> 24:34.150
you need to take her place.

24:36.110 --> 24:40.190
Or we'll tell Patrizia that you were
behind the raid and we'll kill you.

24:41.790 --> 24:44.030
What do you say?

24:49.830 --> 24:53.710
We don't want this,
we want you to be okay.

24:56.590 --> 24:59.108
Nicola, think about your family.

24:59.110 --> 25:01.468
Your mamma, your sister.

25:01.470 --> 25:05.028
That sweet little niece of yours,
she's so cute.

25:05.030 --> 25:11.468
Your women need peace of mind,
they need a secure future.

25:11.470 --> 25:13.948
Or not?

25:13.950 --> 25:16.190
Beat it.

25:21.310 --> 25:25.870
Nicola...
We got an offer for you.

25:29.670 --> 25:33.228
You kill Patrizia

25:33.230 --> 25:35.630
and take back what's yours.

27:33.790 --> 27:35.828
- Where were you?
- What do you want from me?

27:35.830 --> 27:37.868
Didn't mamma tell you not to go out?

27:37.870 --> 27:41.550
- I went for a walk.
- Get in there.

27:43.230 --> 27:46.028
Serena, you need to stay here,
full stop.

27:46.030 --> 27:49.068
Who the fuck are you
to tell me what I can do?

27:49.070 --> 27:52.468
Don't you get it,
we got a big fucking problem?

27:52.470 --> 27:54.108
How can I make you get it?

27:54.110 --> 27:55.788
What's your problem, Nicola?

27:55.790 --> 27:58.628
You think only you got problems?

27:58.630 --> 28:02.228
If you'd talk once in a while
we could find a solution.

28:02.230 --> 28:05.308
What's your big fucking problem, Nicola?

28:05.310 --> 28:08.308
The kids are asleep, are you crazy?

28:08.310 --> 28:10.108
No one was supposed to go out.

28:10.110 --> 28:12.548
I told her, but you know
what your sister's like.

28:12.550 --> 28:17.428
- I sure do.
- Well done. Well done.

28:17.430 --> 28:21.550
You always take his side.
I'm always the bad one.

28:25.190 --> 28:28.108
Go back to bed, Mamma.

28:28.110 --> 28:30.870
Go.

28:50.470 --> 28:54.028
- Can I go to my friends?
- Sure, off you go.

28:54.030 --> 28:55.870
You, go slow!

29:02.750 --> 29:05.270
Your aunt called.

29:07.070 --> 29:09.190
She said Lino's missing.

29:11.470 --> 29:15.110
- Do you know where Lino is?
- No, I don't know.

29:16.470 --> 29:21.308
He didn't come home last night,
he didn't even call.

29:21.310 --> 29:23.510
She's worried.

29:24.590 --> 29:27.150
- You don't know anything?
- No, Mamma.

29:29.910 --> 29:35.550
- What's going on?
- What you said, Lino's missing.

29:47.310 --> 29:48.710
Hello?

29:54.550 --> 29:55.990
Where?

29:57.710 --> 29:59.990
See you there tonight.

30:07.190 --> 30:09.230
I gotta go, Ma.

30:13.830 --> 30:16.030
Be careful.

30:46.430 --> 30:49.110
- Grazia.
- Mickey.

30:50.590 --> 30:51.990
Can you hear me?

30:53.230 --> 30:55.748
Something bad's going down.

30:55.750 --> 30:58.630
I can't explain now,
you gotta come back now.

32:58.870 --> 33:00.190
Well?

33:01.470 --> 33:03.390
You thought it over?

33:06.710 --> 33:08.230
And what did you think?

33:12.270 --> 33:15.470
If I wasn't forced to, I'd never do it.

33:17.270 --> 33:19.390
But Patrizia isn't family.

33:21.910 --> 33:26.348
Whereas Michelangelo is your brother.
Have you thought this through?

33:26.350 --> 33:29.628
If you really care about someone,

33:29.630 --> 33:31.830
you gotta be prepared to do anything.

33:32.950 --> 33:35.870
Even hurt them
if it's for their own good.

33:37.430 --> 33:39.710
I hope he feels the same way.

33:40.950 --> 33:43.428
But that's your business.

33:43.430 --> 33:45.948
As for what I gotta do, I'm ready.

33:45.950 --> 33:47.630
- When?
- Tomorrow.

33:49.590 --> 33:52.070
So tomorrow we'll be fucking rid of her.

33:54.310 --> 33:56.590
And after
we'll all drink a toast together.

34:02.230 --> 34:03.910
You can go now.

34:24.870 --> 34:26.510
You just come in like that?

34:28.190 --> 34:30.027
We're not kids anymore.

34:30.030 --> 34:32.670
Come with me,
I wanna show you something.

34:34.389 --> 34:38.670
- Serena...
- It's important.

34:57.510 --> 34:59.788
What's all this money?

34:59.790 --> 35:02.988
I've been saving it up all this time.

35:02.990 --> 35:06.868
If I don't come back,
you know where it is.

35:06.870 --> 35:10.110
Why wouldn't you come back,
where are you going?

35:13.710 --> 35:15.590
Nicola!

35:19.150 --> 35:21.828
Serena...

35:21.830 --> 35:25.508
Whatever happens,

35:25.510 --> 35:27.430
you gotta take care of them.

35:30.630 --> 35:33.310
You gotta promise me.

35:36.510 --> 35:37.990
I promise.

36:39.110 --> 36:40.550
Nicola!

36:45.430 --> 36:47.390
Can I talk to you for a minute?

36:49.310 --> 36:51.190
I know everything.

36:54.230 --> 36:56.708
- I didn't have any choice.
- I know.

36:56.710 --> 36:59.990
We'll take care of it,
but you have to trust me.

37:01.710 --> 37:06.350
Give me your gun.
Nicola, trust me.

37:07.870 --> 37:09.750
Give me the gun.

37:18.390 --> 37:20.070
Come with me.

38:16.630 --> 38:18.950
You're my brothers.

38:19.990 --> 38:21.748
- You're my brothers!
- Calm down.

38:21.750 --> 38:24.548
Calm down?
What the fuck are you doing?

38:24.550 --> 38:28.068
- Papa told us to.
- He said not to get you involved.

38:28.070 --> 38:30.108
And you do what he says?

38:30.110 --> 38:32.108
What the fuck's going on?

38:32.110 --> 38:35.468
These two wanted to do things
without telling me

38:35.470 --> 38:38.868
and they wanted to frame you.

38:38.870 --> 38:41.188
What are you going to do now?

38:41.190 --> 38:43.270
How do you wanna fix this?

38:44.270 --> 38:48.830
You wanna talk to Patrizia?
And we go out with the guilty party?

38:50.750 --> 38:52.470
Michelangelo...

38:54.230 --> 38:56.790
Are you with us or against us?

39:58.070 --> 39:59.630
Why are you here?

40:04.150 --> 40:07.268
- What happened?
- You were right.

40:07.270 --> 40:09.030
It was Nicola.

40:10.990 --> 40:12.830
How do you know?

40:14.350 --> 40:17.190
He suggested a deal to my brothers.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.668
Why would he do that?

40:20.670 --> 40:22.950
He wanted to take your place.

40:27.430 --> 40:30.390
That's why I came back.

40:31.390 --> 40:34.790
I did it for you, I took care of you.

40:50.630 --> 40:53.310
I'm expecting your child.

41:59.390 --> 42:00.910
Papa.

42:11.110 --> 42:12.830
It's wrong...

42:14.390 --> 42:18.228
It's wrong having a favorite child.

42:18.230 --> 42:20.510
It's wrong.

42:23.830 --> 42:27.710
I've always loved all my other kids,
all the same.

42:28.910 --> 42:30.470
But not you...

42:31.470 --> 42:33.228
No.

42:33.230 --> 42:36.308
You were something else.

42:36.310 --> 42:39.708
From the first moment,

42:39.710 --> 42:42.628
I loved you so much.

42:42.630 --> 42:44.788
So much.

42:44.790 --> 42:46.350
Too much.

42:54.350 --> 43:00.828
So why did you do what you did to me?
Tell me, I don't get it.

43:00.830 --> 43:04.228
Because a delicate plant dies...

43:04.230 --> 43:07.588
It dies if you put it in the wrong soil.

43:07.590 --> 43:09.830
This plant isn't dead.

43:11.070 --> 43:15.908
Actually, it's sprouted.
It's borne fruit.

43:15.910 --> 43:18.030
Patrizia's having my baby.

43:19.310 --> 43:22.310
It's your blood, we're a family now.

43:29.230 --> 43:32.630
Well, if that's the way it is, go!

43:34.510 --> 43:36.590
You have my blessing.
