these volunteer rosters?

08:49.162 --> 08:51.463
Dad never even put out
the call for volunteers!

08:51.498 --> 08:52.764
Oh, you're kidding!

08:52.799 --> 08:54.199
No, I'm not.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.600
I guess with everything
going on with his health,

08:55.636 --> 08:58.270
it just kept sliding
further down the checklist,

08:58.305 --> 08:59.771
so present company excluded,

08:59.806 --> 09:01.039
our a-team of volunteers

09:01.074 --> 09:03.041
has signed on
to other floats by now.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.242
Oh, honey.

09:04.278 --> 09:06.578
Well, I'm here to help,

09:06.613 --> 09:08.446
and I think I can get
my neighbors, Elliot and Mary,

09:08.482 --> 09:09.481
to pitch in.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.416
Thank you.
That is a start,

09:11.451 --> 09:13.218
but we are going to need
way more help than that

09:13.253 --> 09:15.620
if we have any hope
of succeeding here.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.622
If this goes
off the rails,

09:17.658 --> 09:19.925
dad's whole business
could go under.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.228
Well, your mom always said
nothing is impossible.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.397
And I agree with her.

09:25.432 --> 09:28.099
The company has launched
dozens of floats

09:28.135 --> 09:29.234
down Colorado boulevard

09:29.269 --> 09:30.835
for three generations,

09:30.871 --> 09:32.804
and I am not going
to let us fail now.

09:33.874 --> 09:34.940
Okay.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.942
So, what I think we can do...

09:38.312 --> 09:39.578
Cliff, hey.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.179
Thank you for
meeting me here.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.514
I really needed
to talk to you.

09:42.549 --> 09:43.915
That sounds serious.
Let's walk.

09:43.951 --> 09:44.816
Okay.

09:44.851 --> 09:47.953
Um, so, I looked
at the schedule of yours,

09:47.988 --> 09:50.355
and it's ridiculous!

09:50.390 --> 09:52.324
Look, why don't you
stick to the art

09:52.359 --> 09:53.658
and let me handle
the tough stuff?

09:53.694 --> 09:54.960
The art
is the tough stuff!

09:54.995 --> 09:56.094
Look, no offense,

09:56.129 --> 09:56.962
but you don't know
the first thing

09:56.997 --> 09:57.996
about float decorating.

09:58.031 --> 09:58.930
No, I don't.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.999
Our dry-decorating
hasn't even started yet.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.468
You've scheduled it
to be finished by Saturday?

10:03.503 --> 10:04.302
We're already
behind schedule.

10:04.338 --> 10:06.871
Mr. ellsworth
believes in results,

10:06.907 --> 10:08.373
so when we set up
the live feed,

10:08.408 --> 10:10.308
I want him to see decorating
already underway.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.611
Look, cliff,
my father is under the weather,

10:12.646 --> 10:14.145
so I'm taking over,

10:14.181 --> 10:16.348
and he wasn't able to put out
a call for volunteers,

10:16.383 --> 10:17.515
so we don't even have
a team yet.

10:17.551 --> 10:19.017
We don't have
a team?

10:19.052 --> 10:20.118
No.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.454
What am I going
to show my boss,

10:22.489 --> 10:23.521
a metal frame?

10:23.557 --> 10:25.123
I don't know,
bulldozer,

10:25.158 --> 10:26.825
but this schedule
you've committed us to

10:26.860 --> 10:28.026
is simply impossible.

10:29.563 --> 10:32.063
Look, I'm sorry
about your dad...

10:32.099 --> 10:33.131
Thank you.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.866
But it's a float.

10:34.901 --> 10:37.035
How difficult
can it possibly be?

10:39.072 --> 10:40.672
First order of business,

10:40.707 --> 10:43.375
I'm going to take charge
of the volunteer recruiting.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.543
And how do you
plan to do that?

10:45.579 --> 10:46.811
I'll use
a multi-pronged approach

10:46.847 --> 10:48.847
involving
message board posting,

10:48.882 --> 10:50.048
viral advertising,

10:50.083 --> 10:52.851
and targeted
social media engagement.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.686
-You?
-Yeah.

10:54.721 --> 10:55.987
Somebody's got
to do it,

10:56.023 --> 10:58.356
and clearly,
your approach is...

10:58.392 --> 11:00.125
A little chaotic.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.201
Don't know.
How about this fella?

11:10.237 --> 11:12.370
Oh, I love it,
but a little too short,

11:15.575 --> 11:16.341
aw, look!

11:16.376 --> 11:19.177
This one's lost
half its needles.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.378
You're sure you're not
being too picky?

11:20.414 --> 11:22.380
Dad, selecting
the right Christmas tree

11:22.416 --> 11:24.082
is an art.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.084
Speaking of picky,

11:26.119 --> 11:27.252
when are you going
to let me set you up

11:27.287 --> 11:28.286
on that blind date?

11:28.321 --> 11:29.788
I'm a little busy
right now.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.556
I know,
and that's on me,

11:31.591 --> 11:32.590
but come new year's,

11:32.626 --> 11:35.193
you've got to get
back out there!

11:35.228 --> 11:37.362
Andy, hello?

11:37.397 --> 11:39.364
Dad, this one
is a keeper.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.199
Why do I bother?

11:41.234 --> 11:42.634
You never listen
to me anyway.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.102
Kind sir,
can you help us?

11:44.137 --> 11:45.537
We'd love this tree.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.806
Can you pack this up
for him?

11:47.841 --> 11:49.908
All right, dad, I'm late,
but I love you.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.376
[Al]: I love you too.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.745
And we have
a Christmas tree!

11:53.780 --> 11:55.213
-Bye!
-Bye.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.021
[Tools blow air]

12:07.194 --> 12:09.627
Thank you guys so much
for your help.

12:09.663 --> 12:12.130
You are sculpting
like rock stars.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.598
It takes our minds
off our empty nest

12:13.633 --> 12:14.899
back at home.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.000
Our son's spending
Christmas

12:16.036 --> 12:17.736
with his fiancee's
folks in duluth,

12:17.771 --> 12:19.771
and our daughter's
in Europe for work, so...

12:19.806 --> 12:21.606
So please, distract us!

12:21.641 --> 12:22.841
Gladly...

12:22.876 --> 12:24.008
The volunteers
will be here any...

12:24.044 --> 12:25.777
Oh!

12:25.812 --> 12:27.512
So sorry!

12:27.547 --> 12:28.613
That is going
to dry hard.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.984
See you're living up
to your credo of "happy chaos."

12:34.688 --> 12:36.955
Sorry.
Missed a spot.

12:40.060 --> 12:40.992
Okay.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.472
Well...

12:54.508 --> 12:56.541
It's 9:00 A.M. sharp.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.309
You think we're going
to have enough donuts

12:58.345 --> 12:59.811
for all those volunteers
you promised?

13:01.848 --> 13:03.915
Are you ready to let me
handle the recruiting now?

13:18.732 --> 13:20.064
So you're an artist, huh?

13:20.100 --> 13:22.367
More like
an art teacher now.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.568
What happened?

13:23.603 --> 13:25.036
I don't really want
to talk about it.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.204
-Why not?
-Because I just don't.

13:26.239 --> 13:30.675
That gives me a great idea
for a new year's resolution.

13:30.710 --> 13:31.910
Well, I'm glad
you realize

13:31.945 --> 13:33.478
you've got room
for improvement!

13:33.513 --> 13:34.879
It's actually a new year's
resolution for you.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.414
You should learn

13:36.449 --> 13:38.249
how to pick up
on other people's signals.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.518
Huh!
Interesting...

13:40.554 --> 13:42.220
And this is just a thought,

13:42.255 --> 13:43.922
but you might resolve

13:43.957 --> 13:46.758
to keep your opinions
to yourself once in a while.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.226
No, that's not going to happen.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.527
Yeah, I figured
it was reaching.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.032
Community college, huh?

13:54.067 --> 13:55.233
What exactly
are we doing here?

13:55.268 --> 13:56.367
I teach an art class here,

13:56.403 --> 13:58.770
and no one has more time
on their hands than millennials.

13:58.805 --> 13:59.871
See?

13:59.906 --> 14:00.905
Especially
during Christmas.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.508
So pretend like you're Santa
recruiting your elves

14:03.543 --> 14:05.109
and make yourself
useful. Watch.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.945
Hey! We are
building a float...

14:06.980 --> 14:07.912
Hey, we're looking
for volunteers for a float.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.447
Skateboard on over!
We'd love to see you.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.281
Hey there!

14:10.317 --> 14:12.250
We're building
a rose parade float.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.084
We would love
to have you there.

14:13.119 --> 14:14.085
Hi!

14:15.655 --> 14:16.921
Look, Eric,
trust me.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.022
You're going
to love it.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.357
Decorating?

14:19.392 --> 14:20.358
Yeah, I don't know
about that.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.526
[Cliff]: Dude,
believe me,

14:21.561 --> 14:22.627
I know what you mean,

14:22.662 --> 14:24.562
but you know what they say...

14:24.598 --> 14:25.463
No pain, no gain.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.298
Push your elbows together
while you press.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.366
Can we stay on
the matter at hand,

14:28.401 --> 14:29.968
the float?

14:30.003 --> 14:30.935
[Eric]:
Look, Ms. lindry,

14:30.971 --> 14:32.971
I appreciate the offer,

14:33.006 --> 14:34.806
but it's really not my thing.

14:34.841 --> 14:35.673
It might be!

14:35.709 --> 14:38.810
I mean, I am tossing you
a life preserver

14:38.845 --> 14:41.079
in the form
of an independent study.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.781
I mean, your grade in art
is, like, a c-minus at best.

14:43.817 --> 14:44.716
It'll raise his gpa?

14:44.751 --> 14:45.783
Yes.

14:45.819 --> 14:47.085
-Oh, he's in.
-[Andy]: Great!

14:47.120 --> 14:48.253
Coach, seriously?

14:52.759 --> 14:54.125
Old management trick.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.560
Helps to go
directly to the top.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.428
Nice work!

15:01.434 --> 15:02.133
Good morning!

15:02.168 --> 15:03.835
We are looking
for volunteers

15:03.870 --> 15:05.770
for our rose
parade float.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.739
-Thanks.
-[Cliff]: Free pizza!

15:07.774 --> 15:08.973
Free pizza.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.308
[Andy]: We are looking
for volunteers,

15:10.343 --> 15:11.276
and we would love
to have you there.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.176
It's our rose parade float.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.749
I'll handle this.

15:17.784 --> 15:18.683
Merry Christmas!

15:18.718 --> 15:19.851
Hi!

15:19.886 --> 15:21.920
Or should I say
"fleece" navidad?

15:23.623 --> 15:25.957
Fleece? Get it?
Knitting humor?

15:25.992 --> 15:27.425
He's funny!

15:27.460 --> 15:29.260
Do you mind if we
hand out some flyers?

15:29.296 --> 15:33.031
We are building a float
for the rose parade,

15:33.066 --> 15:35.300
and we would love your help.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.267
It's a great group of people.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.137
How we doing?

15:39.172 --> 15:41.039
Well, we got
a couple dozen maybes

15:41.074 --> 15:42.707
and a lot
of "merry christmases,"

15:42.742 --> 15:45.677
so we've got
a long way to go.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.078
Rose parade, huh?

15:47.981 --> 15:50.014
Yes...

15:50.050 --> 15:52.550
And we could use
some help,

15:52.585 --> 15:54.719
so your steak and eggs
are on this guy,

15:54.754 --> 15:56.454
if you hear us out.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.656
Now, my family's been involved
in the rose parade

15:58.692 --> 15:59.424
for many, many years...

16:01.394 --> 16:03.127
[Al]: Just spread them out
a little bit more, hon'.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.263
Dad, I got this.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.331
Maybe I should go grab
the other ladder and help.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.598
No, no,
just sit down.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.300
Relax.
Enjoy your hot chocolate.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.768
Honey, I'm fine.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.270
Besides, you know me.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.304
A little decorating
is therapeutic.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.006
A little?

16:15.041 --> 16:17.108
You promised
to take it easy this year.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.444
I can't help myself.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.678
I've got time
on my hands

16:20.714 --> 16:21.813
and decorating
in my blood.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.147
Let's finish the fence.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.949
[Al]: You know,

16:24.985 --> 16:27.218
you don't have to spend
all your weekends with me.

16:27.253 --> 16:28.853
Who else would I want
to spend time

16:28.888 --> 16:30.388
around Christmas?

16:30.423 --> 16:31.622
When are you going
to slow down

16:31.658 --> 16:32.824
and do something for yourself?

16:32.859 --> 16:33.958
Dad...

16:33.994 --> 16:35.460
We've had
this conversation

16:35.495 --> 16:37.662
a million times.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.231
You know, the holiday gala's
coming up soon.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.066
How about you stand in
for me this year?

16:42.102 --> 16:43.267
I mean,

16:43.303 --> 16:44.902
somebody from the company's
got to put in an appearance,

16:44.938 --> 16:47.171
and, hey, you might meet
somebody nice there,

16:47.207 --> 16:48.639
and it would make your father
very happy.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.144
Okay, I'll go.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.045
Great.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.315
You need to be
putting yourself out there.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.017
These lights are going
to be beautiful.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.351
Don't change
the subject.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.487
Okay!

17:02.522 --> 17:05.089
The broken record's
done skipping.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.191
So how are things
down at the warehouse?

17:07.227 --> 17:08.526
I am going stir-crazy here.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.060
They're going great,

17:10.096 --> 17:11.262
but we do miss
our four-star general.

17:11.297 --> 17:13.498
Ha!

17:13.532 --> 17:14.265
And the fella
from north lake?

17:14.300 --> 17:15.867
Don't ask,

17:15.902 --> 17:17.502
but I have made
a new year's resolution

17:17.537 --> 17:19.170
to look on the bright side
of things.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.539
We handed out 2,000 flyers,
so I'm hoping for the best.

17:21.574 --> 17:22.540
Wow!

17:23.609 --> 17:24.509
That's the spirit!

17:24.544 --> 17:25.343
Good job.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.691
[Andy]:
Not a bad turnout, considering.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.994
Yeah, it's time to separate
the wheat from the chaff.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.296
Cliff, are you nuts?

17:45.331 --> 17:46.864
We need to take anyone
and everyone!

17:46.900 --> 17:49.033
No, I've hired
hundreds of people.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.234
If I've learned
anything,

17:50.270 --> 17:51.769
it's that you only
take the top 10%.

17:51.805 --> 17:53.638
A hundred percent
of people have talent,

17:53.673 --> 17:54.405
if given the chance.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.707
That's as
statistically impossible

17:56.743 --> 17:57.442
as it is absurd.

17:57.477 --> 18:00.111
No, trust me...
I got this.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.322
Can you tell me

18:11.357 --> 18:12.490
about a challenge
you encountered

18:12.525 --> 18:14.725
that you bulldogged through
and then got results from?

18:18.598 --> 18:19.797
No?

18:19.833 --> 18:21.332
We're looking
for volunteers

18:21.367 --> 18:22.834
who are fully committed
to the rose parade.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.335
Why are you fully committed?

18:24.370 --> 18:25.803
Um....

18:25.839 --> 18:27.171
Well, I don't want to fail...

18:27.207 --> 18:28.139
Great.

18:28.174 --> 18:29.240
My art class.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.076
Okay.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.144
So, Christine,

18:33.179 --> 18:35.913
I see you are
a physics student.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.315
Why do you want
to volunteer

18:37.350 --> 18:39.183
for the rose parade?

18:39.219 --> 18:40.451
I'm trying
to do one thing a day

18:40.487 --> 18:41.619
that scares me.

18:41.654 --> 18:42.653
Oh, that's great.

18:42.689 --> 18:43.588
Last week,
i tried rye bread.

18:44.824 --> 18:45.790
Rye bread?

18:45.825 --> 18:47.425
Uh-huh...

18:47.460 --> 18:48.459
Yeah.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.460
Making it?

18:49.496 --> 18:50.495
Eating it.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.764
So do you have
any experience

18:53.800 --> 18:55.133
building
rose parade floats?

18:55.168 --> 18:56.701
Building?

18:56.736 --> 18:59.003
None,
but as former rose queen,

18:59.038 --> 19:00.338
I have ridden
on my fair share.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.508
Right, and if you volunteer
with us,

19:03.543 --> 19:05.209
you'll need
to get your hands

19:05.245 --> 19:06.944
and, oftentimes,
your clothing

19:06.980 --> 19:08.179
quite dirty.

19:08.214 --> 19:10.148
Is that something
you're comfortable with?

19:11.351 --> 19:13.184
Yes! Yes.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.620
Yes.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.121
Great.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.557
And what about any
experience with flowers

19:19.592 --> 19:21.559
or natural
decorating materials?

19:21.594 --> 19:22.793
I spend 10 months
out of the year

19:22.829 --> 19:23.794
driving a big rig,

19:23.830 --> 19:25.663
so, uh...

19:25.698 --> 19:26.664
None.

19:26.699 --> 19:27.698
Great.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.467
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.301
What are natural
decorating materials?

19:33.439 --> 19:34.805
[Andy]:
Thanks for coming by.

19:34.841 --> 19:35.673
You bet.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.508
I'm always happy
for an early start.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.677
-I brought us coffees.
-Thanks.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.045
What's with
all the sheets?

19:41.080 --> 19:42.880
Oh, no,
don't worry about that.

19:42.916 --> 19:45.650
Um, so here they are.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.718
[Cliff]: Oh, great, you
got the wilderness girls.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.487
No, they actually
got snatched up

19:49.522 --> 19:51.422
by the south Pasadena
community float,

19:51.457 --> 19:53.524
and we lost
a couple others, too.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.227
Like I said, we need
to take anyone and everyone.

19:56.262 --> 19:57.828
Okay, fine.

19:57.864 --> 19:58.829
You win.

19:58.865 --> 19:59.830
Okay...

19:59.866 --> 20:02.099
And we need to find a few more
like Emily, too,

20:02.135 --> 20:03.501
if we're going to pull this off.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.535
Emily?

20:04.571 --> 20:06.337
Oh, Emily bowed out.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.872
Wait, what? Why?

20:07.907 --> 20:08.806
Yeah, I don't know.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.841
Something about
my being too controlling.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.343
Cliff!

20:12.378 --> 20:13.311
You just lost us

20:13.346 --> 20:16.047
the best dry-decorator
in all of Pasadena,

20:16.082 --> 20:17.448
if not the world!

20:17.483 --> 20:18.583
Come with me.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.851
We've got to get her
back right now!

20:20.887 --> 20:21.752
Come on!

20:21.788 --> 20:24.188
What could you possibly
have said to her?

20:24.224 --> 20:26.190
I really don't see

20:26.226 --> 20:27.892
why one person's worth
all this trouble.

20:27.927 --> 20:28.859
Oh, really?

20:31.497 --> 20:32.730
[Knocks]

20:39.572 --> 20:40.438
Hello, darling.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.941
Emily, how do you make
golden bear fur?

20:43.977 --> 20:45.476
Two parts tamarind shells,

20:45.511 --> 20:47.044
one part
gold strawflower petals,

20:47.080 --> 20:49.113
put in a cement mixer
for 30 minutes,

20:49.148 --> 20:50.281
add golden flax seed,

20:50.316 --> 20:52.016
and mix with coconut husks.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.422
Emily...

21:02.762 --> 21:03.594
Will you... come back?

21:06.032 --> 21:07.198
Because?

21:09.002 --> 21:11.502
Because...

21:11.537 --> 21:12.803
I'm sorry.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.744
Yes, for you dear.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.146
Not for you, wingtips.

21:22.181 --> 21:22.780
I'll get my things.

21:26.719 --> 21:29.320
I'm glad
you saw the light.

21:29.355 --> 21:31.322
Yeah, I just didn't want
to be on the receiving end

21:31.357 --> 21:33.291
of a woman
with a blowtorch.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.930
[Andy]:
That's our team,

21:39.966 --> 21:41.932
and this late in the game,
we are lucky to have them.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.834
We need the float
ready for inspections

21:43.870 --> 21:44.769
by new year's Eve.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.706
Hello, everyone.

21:48.741 --> 21:51.442
My dad, he usually
kicks things off

21:51.477 --> 21:52.877
with a few words,

21:52.912 --> 21:54.879
but clearly,
i am not big al...

21:54.914 --> 21:55.780
[Laughing]

21:55.815 --> 21:56.580
I just want
to say

21:56.616 --> 21:59.317
thank you so much
for being here,

21:59.352 --> 22:01.786
and we truly appreciate
you giving us your time

22:01.821 --> 22:02.953
during Christmas...

22:02.989 --> 22:04.355
[Clears throat]

22:05.358 --> 22:06.357
Some may say

22:06.392 --> 22:07.958
that our challenge
is daunting,

22:07.994 --> 22:09.694
that the odds
are against us,

22:09.729 --> 22:10.728
and while it is true

22:10.763 --> 22:13.230
that we are completely
and totally understaffed,

22:13.266 --> 22:15.199
and the roses are going
to start arriving

22:15.234 --> 22:16.801
in only nine days,

22:16.836 --> 22:19.003
that means it's just going to be
a race against time.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.037
Andy, what are you doing?

22:20.073 --> 22:21.238
I'm inspiring the team!

22:21.274 --> 22:23.674
No, clearly,
you're scaring them.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.142
[Andy]: Christine!

22:27.246 --> 22:29.146
Come back.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.021
Think like Van gogh.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.798
I have never supervised
a float before...

22:49.769 --> 22:51.035
But I don't think

22:51.070 --> 22:53.003
Vincent Van gogh
did either,

22:53.039 --> 22:54.605
and he once said that,

22:54.640 --> 22:57.875
"great things
are done

22:57.910 --> 22:59.610
by a series of small things
brought together."

22:59.645 --> 23:01.879
And if that isn't us,

23:01.914 --> 23:03.681
I don't know what is.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.618
We have a chance here
to do something great,

23:07.653 --> 23:10.187
something that people
might remember forever,

23:10.223 --> 23:11.889
so what do you guys say?

23:11.924 --> 23:13.891
Let's build
a great float!

23:13.926 --> 23:15.926
[Cheering]

23:21.434 --> 23:23.401
[Andy]: So now,
we have the bear assembled,

23:23.436 --> 23:24.535
and we painted the float,

23:24.570 --> 23:25.603
so we know

23:25.638 --> 23:27.538
where all the dried petals
and colored seeds go.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.039
Helps all you greenhorns
stick to the design.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.575
[Andy]:
And now, we take our glue.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.210
Put in your paintbrush.

23:33.246 --> 23:35.980
We add it directly
to the float.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.616
We then place on the moss,

23:38.651 --> 23:40.584
and then next, we're going
to take the colored seeds

23:40.620 --> 23:42.953
and place them one at a time
using tweezers.

23:42.989 --> 23:45.222
Wait, one at a time?

23:45.258 --> 23:47.425
The parade is this new year's,
remember?

23:47.460 --> 23:49.226
Art can't be rushed, cliff.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.361
Clearly, not
when you're in charge.

23:50.396 --> 23:54.165
It's not rocket science.
It's putting flowers in glue.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.100
Okay, guys,
pick up the pace!

23:59.705 --> 24:01.505
So we put these
on the outside.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.073
-Yes, I agree.
-Paint them white.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.141
That will look good.

24:08.981 --> 24:11.849
Um, Eric?

24:11.884 --> 24:13.951
I think
those flowers right here,

24:13.986 --> 24:15.019
they should be red.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.187
Oh!

24:16.222 --> 24:17.154
Right!

24:28.201 --> 24:29.233
Wait a minute.

24:30.736 --> 24:32.169
Has Eric been having trouble
with colors?

24:43.716 --> 24:45.483
That's beautiful.

24:47.487 --> 24:49.119
Are you sure
this whole webcam thing

24:49.155 --> 24:50.721
is a good idea?

24:50.756 --> 24:52.289
Sure. It keeps
my boss in the loop.

24:52.325 --> 24:55.025
Oh, and we might have
the rose parade host

24:55.061 --> 24:56.160
and camera crew
coming by later

24:56.195 --> 24:57.394
to shoot a promo.

24:57.430 --> 24:58.162
And shouldn't we wait

24:58.197 --> 24:59.463
'til we're a little
further along

24:59.499 --> 25:00.264
in the decorating?

25:00.299 --> 25:01.699
Yeah, we should be
further along

25:01.734 --> 25:03.234
in the decorating process.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.002
If you think
decorating is so easy,

25:05.037 --> 25:06.504
why don't you give it a try?

25:06.539 --> 25:07.471
Are you afraid
to get your hands dirty,

25:07.507 --> 25:08.372
or you think
you're above it?

25:08.407 --> 25:09.373
I'm supervising.

25:09.408 --> 25:10.241
Oh, right.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.909
Honestly, I'd rather be
in Shanghai.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.477
Shanghai?

25:13.513 --> 25:15.913
Yeah, heading up my company's
whole Asian operations.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.648
It's where I'm supposed to be,

25:17.683 --> 25:19.316
and where I will be
once this is done.

25:19.352 --> 25:20.451
Well, excellent!

25:20.486 --> 25:22.086
I kind of look forward
to you being in Shanghai, too.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.187
Mm-hmm.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.221
[Sneezes]

25:24.257 --> 25:26.023
Uh... miss lindry?

25:26.058 --> 25:27.091
There's a problem.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.059
I-i might be
allergic to flowers!

25:30.263 --> 25:31.428
Oh...

25:31.464 --> 25:32.997
[Sneezes]

25:33.032 --> 25:34.565
Sweetie,
did you just realize this now?

25:34.600 --> 25:36.200
I didn't totally
think it through.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.768
But it's the rose parade.

25:37.803 --> 25:38.869
Achoo!

25:38.905 --> 25:39.703
Okay, let's just...

25:39.739 --> 25:41.171
There's tissues
right over there.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.339
You just take
a little break.

25:42.375 --> 25:43.807
[Sneezes]

25:45.878 --> 25:47.011
Off to a great start.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.046
Well, it always takes
the newbies

25:49.081 --> 25:50.948
a little time to find
their decorating legs,

25:50.983 --> 25:52.116
but we're going
to be fine.

25:52.151 --> 25:53.284
Okay?

25:53.319 --> 25:54.218
[Christine sneezes]

25:58.791 --> 26:00.357
Lou, you ready
for the water test?

26:00.393 --> 26:02.626
Just got to tighten
this one last pipe,

26:02.662 --> 26:04.094
and then we can do
the water test.

26:04.130 --> 26:04.929
Let's get moving.

26:04.964 --> 26:07.031
Come on, guys,
let's check it out.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.732
-Let's see it!
-[Lou]: Okay, Andy,

26:08.768 --> 26:11.435
can you press the black button
on that panel?

26:11.470 --> 26:12.202
We're going to see
how the water flows.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.404
You ready?

26:13.439 --> 26:14.371
Yeah.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.107
[Pump whirs]

26:21.847 --> 26:23.280
Yeah!

26:23.316 --> 26:24.214
-Oh, yeah.
-Nice work.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.416
Good job.

26:25.451 --> 26:26.250
[Pipes groan]

Red button! Red button!

-Red button!
-It's not working!

26:32.792 --> 26:34.792
Quick! Quick! Quick!

26:34.827 --> 26:36.827
What? Where is it?

26:36.862 --> 26:38.629
[Lou]: Turn off the spigot!
Turn it off!

26:38.664 --> 26:40.297
[Water stops]

26:40.333 --> 26:41.899
[Andy]: Oh, no...

26:41.934 --> 26:43.434
That was bad.

26:44.670 --> 26:45.836
Pump's broken.

26:45.871 --> 26:48.272
And we captured it
all on webcam.

26:48.307 --> 26:51.342
At least it can't get
any worse than this.

26:51.377 --> 26:52.209
Yeah...

26:58.384 --> 26:59.450
Hi!

26:59.485 --> 27:00.484
I'm mark steines.

27:00.519 --> 27:01.352
I'm here to do
the interview...

27:01.387 --> 27:02.353
Oh...

27:02.388 --> 27:03.554
Hi!

27:06.192 --> 27:07.524
Uh... you want me
to come back later?

27:07.560 --> 27:10.494
Maybe after the
monsoon-season ends?

27:10.529 --> 27:12.129
That would be great!

27:12.164 --> 27:13.130
Sure.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.432
Do you need help?

27:15.468 --> 27:16.433
Yes, we do!

27:16.469 --> 27:17.334
No...

27:18.838 --> 27:19.803
Um...

27:20.840 --> 27:22.606
Here.

27:22.642 --> 27:24.308
Oh, thank you.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.342
Thank you.

27:26.345 --> 27:27.878
Let's reschedule, yeah?

27:27.913 --> 27:29.346
-That sounds great.
-Good.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.283
Merry Christmas!

27:33.319 --> 27:34.284
[Mark]:
Same to you.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.319
Happy new year!

27:35.354 --> 27:37.354
Take care.
Stay dry.

27:37.390 --> 27:38.555
[Andy]:
Thank you!

27:38.591 --> 27:39.857
'Kay, watch
the water, bill.

27:39.892 --> 27:40.858
Off he goes.

27:43.763 --> 27:48.132
Mr. ellsworth,

27:48.167 --> 27:51.001
wasn't nearly as bad

27:51.037 --> 27:52.903
as it looked on the webcam.

27:52.938 --> 27:53.704
I find that hard to believe.

27:53.739 --> 27:56.340
It's just
that these creative-types

27:56.375 --> 27:57.207
don't always understand
the bigger picture.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.176
Or maybe it's that
the business-types

27:59.211 --> 28:00.177
don't understand

28:00.212 --> 28:02.646
that float decorating
is an art of its own!

28:02.682 --> 28:03.580
[Mr. ellsworth]: <i> I'm sure</i>
<i> you two can work this out.</i>

28:03.616 --> 28:05.683
<i> Is that all?</i>
<i> Then goodbye.</i>

28:06.952 --> 28:08.152
Thank you for throwing me
under the bus, by the way.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.086
Oh, that's rich.

28:09.121 --> 28:09.887
Blame me!

28:09.922 --> 28:11.321
You know,
instead of "bulldozer,"

28:11.357 --> 28:12.222
they should call you
"apple pie,"

28:12.258 --> 28:13.357
on account
of how quickly you crumble.

28:13.392 --> 28:15.059
Are you done?

28:15.094 --> 28:16.226
No, but our float might be!

28:16.262 --> 28:17.327
We're going to be
behind schedule

28:17.363 --> 28:18.362
and over budget,

28:18.397 --> 28:19.363
and if we don't
pass inspection,

28:19.398 --> 28:20.698
that means
no parade for us.

28:20.733 --> 28:21.932
If...

28:21.967 --> 28:22.866
[Mr ellsworth clears throat
over phone]

28:22.902 --> 28:24.501
Did you hang up the phone?

28:24.537 --> 28:26.136
Nope.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.084
I got this.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.118
Nonsense, I got it.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.389
You a longshoreman
when you're not working here?

28:45.424 --> 28:47.691
There's "tough,"
and there's "rose parade tough."

28:47.727 --> 28:49.193
I'm the latter.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.598
Never knew a float could use
so much Spanish moss.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.268
So you known Andy very long?

28:58.304 --> 29:00.504
Oh, gosh,
all her life.

29:02.108 --> 29:03.774
She always been
as stubborn as a mule?

29:03.809 --> 29:06.143
Andy knows her mind,
all right.

29:06.178 --> 29:07.945
Ha! One way of putting it.

29:10.282 --> 29:13.417
I know she's an artist,
but what else does she do?

29:14.420 --> 29:16.286
What doesn't she do?

29:16.322 --> 29:17.421
She loves to hike.

29:17.456 --> 29:18.589
She bakes.

29:18.624 --> 29:20.624
She volunteers.

29:20.659 --> 29:21.558
Her rummage sales alone

29:21.594 --> 29:24.862
helped her church
build a new youth center.

29:25.965 --> 29:26.897
Why do you ask?

29:26.932 --> 29:28.899
Just, uh...

29:28.934 --> 29:30.300
Trying to find
some common ground.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.106
You could start
by respecting what we do.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.955
Well, well, well!
You again.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.457
Mr. bulldozer.

29:53.492 --> 29:54.491
Miss chaos.

29:54.527 --> 29:55.526
What are you doing here?

29:55.561 --> 29:57.294
A little shopping
for a friend.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.530
What? You have friends?

29:59.565 --> 30:01.532
That's amazing.
Male or female?

30:01.567 --> 30:03.433
It's actually
a gift for my mother.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.935
You have a mother?

30:04.970 --> 30:07.137
Oh!

30:07.173 --> 30:08.939
I know I can be a little
overbearing sometimes.

30:08.974 --> 30:09.940
I'll try to take
my foot off the gas.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.477
This place is
a minefield.

30:13.512 --> 30:14.545
What do you mean?

30:14.580 --> 30:15.879
Everywhere I look
are reminders

30:15.915 --> 30:18.148
of how soon
our deadline is.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.449
Are you getting nervous?

30:22.488 --> 30:23.353
Fine, look...

30:24.824 --> 30:26.290
I've got a lot
riding on this, okay?

30:26.325 --> 30:28.892
Thing is, Mr. ellsworth's
pretty intolerant

30:28.928 --> 30:30.360
when it comes to failure,

30:30.396 --> 30:32.162
and we're not off
to a great start.

30:32.198 --> 30:33.163
If I deliver,

30:33.199 --> 30:34.531
I'll get the promotion
I've been working towards

30:34.567 --> 30:35.833
my whole career.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.501
Is that your dream?

30:37.536 --> 30:40.070
I... I'm not
a "dreams" person.

30:40.105 --> 30:41.839
Come on, cliff.
Everyone needs a passion.

30:41.874 --> 30:43.707
Well, it's a goal.

30:43.742 --> 30:45.075
I understand that.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.243
I mean, it's all I can do

30:46.278 --> 30:48.378
to keep
my dad's business afloat.

30:48.414 --> 30:49.479
Well, maybe
we have something in common

30:49.515 --> 30:51.148
after all...

30:51.183 --> 30:52.749
Pressure.

30:52.785 --> 30:54.084
That gives me another idea

30:54.119 --> 30:56.153
for a new year's resolution
for you.

30:56.188 --> 30:59.189
It's okay
to sometimes ask for help.

30:59.225 --> 31:01.992
And I've got
one for you...

31:02.027 --> 31:04.261
Don't smile so much
when you know you're right.

31:04.296 --> 31:05.596
How about from now on,

31:05.631 --> 31:06.897
I handle all
the decisions

31:06.932 --> 31:08.665
when it comes
to decorating,

31:08.701 --> 31:10.267
and you handle
everything else,

31:10.302 --> 31:11.501
or to put it in terms
you may understand,

31:11.537 --> 31:14.071
we make this
a win-win?

31:14.106 --> 31:15.505
You had me at win.

31:16.942 --> 31:18.609
[Andy]: Okay, everyone!

31:18.644 --> 31:19.443
I just want
to let you know

31:19.478 --> 31:20.777
that cliff and i
have worked it out,

31:20.813 --> 31:22.079
and we are on
the exact same page

31:22.114 --> 31:23.080
from here on out.

31:23.115 --> 31:24.114
[Cliff]:
That's right.

31:24.149 --> 31:26.016
A coach and an assistant coach

31:26.051 --> 31:27.885
need to get along
for a team to win.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.019
Right, Eric?

31:29.054 --> 31:29.887
And to be clear,

31:29.922 --> 31:33.390
cliff is the
assistant coach here...

31:33.425 --> 31:34.758
And the assistant
coach is snacking

31:34.793 --> 31:35.626
on our decorating
palette!

31:35.661 --> 31:37.527
Sorry.
I love edamame.

31:37.563 --> 31:38.428
Okay, so let's
get started.

31:38.464 --> 31:40.030
Ashley and Lou,

31:40.065 --> 31:41.365
you will be on decorating duty
with Emily.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.866
10-4. We're on it.

31:42.902 --> 31:43.767
And Mary and Elliot,

31:43.802 --> 31:44.735
can you finish up
the critters today?

31:44.770 --> 31:47.104
We want to have those
ready by tomorrow...

31:47.139 --> 31:48.705
And Eric?

31:48.741 --> 31:51.308
I think I owe you
an apology.

31:51.343 --> 31:53.143
You're colorblind,
aren't you?

31:53.178 --> 31:54.611
And that's why you've been
having trouble in class?

31:56.148 --> 31:57.314
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

31:57.349 --> 31:58.548
Christine, come here!

32:00.786 --> 32:03.053
I have a mission
for you two.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.755
I want you to go
to all the other float barns

32:04.790 --> 32:06.757
and scope out
what they have going on, 'Kay?

32:06.792 --> 32:07.758
Awesome!

32:07.793 --> 32:09.059
Have fun.

32:09.962 --> 32:11.628
Um, and cliff,

32:11.664 --> 32:13.797
we are running low
on a few supplies.

32:13.832 --> 32:15.832
Do you think you could
help me out with these?

32:15.868 --> 32:16.867
Sure.

32:19.138 --> 32:20.170
Coconut husks?

32:20.205 --> 32:21.038
Tamarind seeds?
Millet?

32:21.073 --> 32:22.806
Where am I going
to find this stuff?

32:22.841 --> 32:25.275
'Kay, it might be best
if I handle this one myself.

32:25.311 --> 32:26.310
No, no, no.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.411
Remember
our agreement.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.345
You take care
of the artwork,

32:28.380 --> 32:29.680
I do everything else,

32:29.715 --> 32:31.081
including
the purse strings.

32:31.116 --> 32:32.516
Okay, then grab
your credit card.

32:32.551 --> 32:33.684
We're going shopping.

without it.

clanking]

32:46.031 --> 32:47.764
That clanking noise
when you park

32:47.800 --> 32:50.000
means your caliper's
not mounted right.

32:50.035 --> 32:51.435
Thank you.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.103
Who would have figured you
for a gearhead?

32:53.138 --> 32:54.604
A rusty one.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.672
I love cars,

32:55.708 --> 32:56.473
but it's been
a long time

32:56.508 --> 32:58.041
since I've looked
under a hood.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.876
Well, it must be hard,

32:59.912 --> 33:01.778
being away from your family
at Christmas.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.480
Actually, it's
kind of a relief.

33:03.515 --> 33:04.948
What, you don't
like Christmas?

33:04.984 --> 33:07.184
Honestly, I like
when it's over.

33:07.219 --> 33:08.018
Yeah, Christmas
for me

33:08.053 --> 33:09.453
is the day the
stock markets close

33:09.488 --> 33:11.455
and everything
just stops.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.290
So you'll be
spending Christmas

33:13.325 --> 33:14.725
in your hotel room?

33:14.760 --> 33:16.994
No, I've got a couple
colleagues in town.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.495
What about you?

33:18.530 --> 33:20.197
I'll be going
to my dad's house.

33:20.232 --> 33:21.999
He always has us over.
It's really fun,

33:22.034 --> 33:23.000
but I have to admit,
this year,

33:23.035 --> 33:25.802
I am feeling the stress
of finishing the float,

33:25.838 --> 33:26.703
and just
a million other things

33:26.739 --> 33:27.804
going on.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.039
You are always
on the move.

33:29.074 --> 33:30.540
You should slow
down a bit.

You're one to talk.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.043
Hey, I work hard,

but I take time
to enjoy.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.380
You just work hard.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.148
Honestly, I...

33:38.183 --> 33:40.350
I don't get it
about parades.

33:40.386 --> 33:41.518
I mean,
all that work,

33:41.553 --> 33:43.353
they go by,
then it's over.

33:43.389 --> 33:44.988
Oh, come on!

33:45.024 --> 33:46.356
I mean, you get out there
on new year's day,

33:46.392 --> 33:47.424
it's incredible!

You've got
precision equestrians,

all these amazing floats.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.365
I mean, the flowers fade,

33:55.401 --> 33:57.667
but the floats, they live on
in people's memories.

Trust me,

33:59.104 --> 34:00.404
when you see the parade
up close,

34:00.439 --> 34:01.371
you'll understand.

34:01.407 --> 34:02.706
I will, huh?

34:02.741 --> 34:04.041
You will. Come on.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.112
$50 a pound?

34:10.149 --> 34:11.715
That must be
a mistake!

34:11.750 --> 34:13.050
What can I say?

34:13.085 --> 34:14.351
My supplier in Asia's
got me over a barrel.

34:14.386 --> 34:17.054
That's highway robbery.
We can't afford that.

34:17.089 --> 34:18.255
What're we going to do?

34:19.425 --> 34:20.290
I'm going
to make a call.

34:20.324 --> 34:21.391

34:39.143 --> 34:40.710
What are you doing?

34:40.746 --> 34:42.446
Oh, I minored
in mandarin.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.047
The supplier said
for the rose parade,

34:44.083 --> 34:45.549
he'll donate our
supplies for free.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.150
He's over-nighting what we need
to the warehouse.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.918
Wait, what?

34:48.954 --> 34:51.353
I've got to say,
you are full of surprises.

34:52.858 --> 34:55.225
That's as close to a compliment
as I think I'm going to get.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.293
What's next?

34:56.328 --> 34:58.628
Uh, one final stop.
Come on.

34:58.664 --> 35:00.363
We just have
to swing by my place.

35:02.334 --> 35:03.400
This'll be quick.

35:03.435 --> 35:04.434
I just have to pick up
a few things for the float.

No, no, no,
I'll be there.

35:11.043 --> 35:12.976

Great doing business
with you.

Goodbye.

35:18.217 --> 35:19.282
Wow!

35:19.318 --> 35:20.617
That's amazing.

35:22.187 --> 35:23.854
Nothing to see here.

35:23.889 --> 35:26.156
No, that's
really great!

35:26.191 --> 35:27.491
You should show that off!

35:27.526 --> 35:30.160
It's just something
i do for myself.

35:30.195 --> 35:31.795
No one needs to see it.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.730
But this is really good.

35:35.067 --> 35:37.501
But it takes work and time,

35:37.536 --> 35:38.635
and I have no time,

35:38.670 --> 35:41.938
so lately, it's just a way
to channel my frustration.

35:41.974 --> 35:43.140
Well, then...

35:43.175 --> 35:44.374
I guess you owe me
a debt of gratitude

35:44.409 --> 35:45.642
for all the inspiration.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.043
[Laughs]

35:47.079 --> 35:47.844
Well, look,
I'm no art critic,

35:47.880 --> 35:50.714
but this could be
in a gallery.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.482
You're just being nice.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.284
Do I look like someone
who's just being nice?

35:54.319 --> 35:55.852
Why don't you put it
out there,

35:55.888 --> 35:56.853
let the world decide?

35:58.090 --> 35:59.356
I saw a poster in town

35:59.391 --> 36:00.957

at the holiday gala.

36:00.993 --> 36:01.992

36:02.027 --> 36:04.027
Cliff, I don't show my work.

fumes in here.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.689
Well, we are back from recon,

36:32.724 --> 36:34.324
and we are in for some
serious competition

36:34.359 --> 36:35.425
with the other teams.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.495
Animation,
surround sound,

36:38.530 --> 36:39.763
and almost all
the floats this year

36:39.798 --> 36:41.598
have moving parts
and hydraulics.

36:41.633 --> 36:42.499
Wow.

We're going to have
to kick it up a notch.

No, no, no,
our current float is just fine!

36:49.308 --> 36:50.540
Mr. ellsworth
couldn't have been clearer.

36:50.576 --> 36:51.808
He said simple and on-time.

36:51.843 --> 36:55.278
On-time I get, but simple?

36:55.314 --> 36:57.447
Cliff, 80 million people

We can't deliver just any float.

36:59.418 --> 37:00.183
We've got to do

Amazing, or impossible?

It's the rose parade.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.957
People do the impossible
all the time.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.492
If we add animation
to get the bear moving,

37:09.528 --> 37:10.460
I can help with the physics.

37:10.495 --> 37:12.295
And I know a little bit
about hydraulics.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.965
And cliff, didn't you say
you're an ex-gearhead?

37:15.000 --> 37:15.999
It's been years.

37:16.034 --> 37:17.734
Besides, adding animation
this late in the game

37:17.769 --> 37:19.402
would be
a risky gamble.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.371
Don't business leaders
get where they are

37:21.406 --> 37:22.772

between me and Shanghai.

at the top of our game,

37:40.759 --> 37:42.993

a show-stopping float.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.061
Good.

38:51.096 --> 38:52.062
We can put the hydraulics
under here,

38:52.097 --> 38:54.764
and then we attach
the swivel system to the bear.

38:54.800 --> 38:55.665
Then we should be good to go.

Well, what's the big deal?

40:17.015 --> 40:18.882
Just finish it!

40:18.917 --> 40:20.917
It needs something more,

to pull it all together.

You're big al?

41:06.765 --> 41:07.897
They call me "big al"

all the big decisions.

it's... your daughter.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.558
Your heart's obviously
in the right place,

41:35.594 --> 41:38.094
but my daughter has
an incredibly strong will.

[Chuckles]

41:42.267 --> 41:43.566

41:43.602 --> 41:45.635
it's just better
to go along with her.

41:53.144 --> 41:56.279
You know, in 1934,
the parade theme was water,

41:56.314 --> 41:59.415
and that was the year
that it rained the whole day.

Oh, don't worry.

42:01.119 --> 42:02.318

after it's over,

over the country

42:04.623 --> 42:07.490

I'm drawing numbers

42:19.571 --> 42:21.170

different flowers go.

Carnations are twos,
daisies are threes...

a giant paint-by-numbers.

That's smart.

42:28.980 --> 42:31.714
Why don't we go 50-50
on that ticket to Shanghai?

42:31.750 --> 42:34.183
I feel like we're robbing Asia
of your presence.

42:36.021 --> 42:38.321
I deserve that.

42:38.356 --> 42:39.856
I realize now I should
have talked to you first.

42:42.360 --> 42:43.660
I was honestly trying
to help, but...

42:43.695 --> 42:45.128
I'm sorry.

Oh, I can...

42:51.603 --> 42:55.238
I can see
that you had good intentions...

42:55.273 --> 42:57.974
Just in your bulldozer-y way.

42:59.110 --> 43:01.344
Well, let the bulldozer help.

43:01.379 --> 43:03.413
Let me run interference here,

43:03.448 --> 43:05.181

to do your own work.

wants to lead the team?

as you can go.

from the knot and just...

So, wind down
the thing.

some curve balls.

That's just part of the fun

44:56.528 --> 44:58.728
My husband is an equestrian
in the parade,

more than one runaway pony.

in the parade this year.

45:16.381 --> 45:18.414

for the float.

45:18.450 --> 45:19.515

what happens,

45:19.551 --> 45:20.950
there's always
a solution.

It's these obstacles
that bring us together.

[Laughs]

01:05:22.119 --> 01:05:23.852
All good.

01:05:23.887 --> 01:05:24.619
Like all of us,

01:05:24.655 --> 01:05:25.887
this little fella
just needed

01:05:25.923 --> 01:05:27.055
a little extra support.

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.423
[Laughs]

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:29.724
Guess that mba

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.427
didn't push all your
construction skills aside.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.099
Makes you proud, huh?

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:39.634
Normally,
when I do my job well,

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:42.037
I just see tired faces
and papers getting pushed,

01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:44.706
but...
Here, I see something real.

01:05:46.243 --> 01:05:48.143
Yeah.

01:05:48.178 --> 01:05:49.511
I think we're going
to make our deadline.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:53.248
Yeah, I think I hear
the echoes of success.

01:05:56.086 --> 01:05:57.786
It's almost 8:00.

01:05:57.821 --> 01:05:59.321
Day shift will be in soon.

01:05:59.356 --> 01:06:00.488
Cliff, didn't you say

01:06:00.524 --> 01:06:02.223
you missed
Christmas snowball fights

01:06:02.259 --> 01:06:03.224
back east?

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.359
Yeah, why?

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:07.228
We don't have time
for this!

01:06:07.264 --> 01:06:08.229
I know!

01:06:08.265 --> 01:06:09.564
[Laughing]

01:06:20.944 --> 01:06:21.843
[Footsteps]

01:06:21.878 --> 01:06:22.777
[Mr. ellsworth]: Cliff!

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:27.582
Mr. ellsworth!

01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:28.616
Hi.

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:30.752
[Cliff]: Uh...

01:06:30.787 --> 01:06:31.820
Sir...

01:06:31.855 --> 01:06:33.621
Mr. ellsworth,

01:06:33.657 --> 01:06:34.622
this is Andy...

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:35.590
From sunshine floats.

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:36.791
Hello.

01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:38.827
What is that?

01:06:38.862 --> 01:06:42.263
Why is the bear's head
detached from its body?

01:06:42.299 --> 01:06:43.598
It's just
a minor setback...

01:06:43.633 --> 01:06:44.466
Cliff, what happened
to "ahead of schedule

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:45.266
and under-budget"?

01:06:45.302 --> 01:06:47.168
Sir, we've made
terrific headway!

01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:49.437
You just caught us
at a bad moment.

01:06:49.473 --> 01:06:51.439
It's not nearly
as bad as it looks.

01:06:51.475 --> 01:06:52.307
I'm sure

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:53.675
there's a logical reason
for all of this.

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:54.743
Yes!

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:55.777
We just had a little problem
with the hydraulics,

01:06:55.812 --> 01:06:56.811
so we took it apart.

01:06:56.847 --> 01:06:57.712
It'll be up
and running...

01:06:57.748 --> 01:06:58.680
Hydraulics?

01:06:58.715 --> 01:06:59.848
When are hydraulics
become part of the plan?

01:07:01.852 --> 01:07:03.551
[Both at once]
W-well...

01:07:03.587 --> 01:07:05.487
We thought it would add
a special touch.

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:06.454
Yes, and up our game.

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:07.956
[Mr. ellsworth]:
You're nowhere near done,

01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:10.458
and you decided
to reach for the stars?

01:07:10.494 --> 01:07:12.660
I mean, I was already skeptical
about the waterfall,

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:13.628
and now this?

01:07:13.663 --> 01:07:14.963
Ahead of schedule's
clearly not happening,

01:07:14.998 --> 01:07:15.830
and the budget?

01:07:15.866 --> 01:07:17.665
I don't want
to even think about it.

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:19.801
Mr. ellsworth, we have been
building floats for years,

01:07:19.836 --> 01:07:21.870
and I'm very confident
we can deliver.

01:07:21.905 --> 01:07:23.705
Ms. lindry, I hired
your father to oversee this.

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.340
I didn't hire you.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.542
Yes, my father
is the best in the business,

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:29.210
but given his health,

01:07:29.246 --> 01:07:31.479
I am doing my best
to fill his shoes.

01:07:31.515 --> 01:07:33.415
I'm sure
you had good intentions,

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:34.816
but cliff said
you were out of your depth

01:07:34.851 --> 01:07:36.351
and that this float
would be a disaster

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:37.385
with you in charge,

01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:39.220
and it seems
he was right.

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:46.494
Wow.

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:47.395
You said that?

01:07:47.431 --> 01:07:48.396
No!

01:07:50.634 --> 01:07:52.901
Yes, but...

01:07:52.936 --> 01:07:54.669
I didn't know
what I was talking about.

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:56.704
I didn't know you yet.
I was just venting.

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.039
I can't believe
you would said that to him.

01:07:58.075 --> 01:07:59.274
Andy...

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:01.342
I'd expect that
from art critics,

01:08:01.378 --> 01:08:02.544
but not from you.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:03.711
You never believed in me.

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:05.213
Andy, wait!

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:06.881
I should have known better.

01:08:17.928 --> 01:08:19.828
[Cliff and Mr. ellsworth
talking, indistinct]

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.198
Hey! Good morning,
Christine!

01:08:23.233 --> 01:08:24.365
What's going on?

01:08:24.401 --> 01:08:25.934
It's not pretty.

01:08:25.969 --> 01:08:28.636
A guy in a suit is speaking
in low tones to cliff.

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:31.372
[Emily]:
Where's Andy?

01:08:31.408 --> 01:08:32.941
She took off
as I was driving in,

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:33.908
and she looked
pretty upset.

01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:36.044
[Sighs] Oh, dear.

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:38.513
Well, let's find out
what's wrong.

01:08:40.584 --> 01:08:41.950
[Cliff]:
Look, Mr. ellsworth,

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:44.085
there have been
some executive decisions,

01:08:44.121 --> 01:08:45.286
and if any of them
are missteps,

01:08:45.322 --> 01:08:46.220
then that's all on me.

01:08:46.256 --> 01:08:47.388
Oh,

01:08:47.424 --> 01:08:48.456
there's been some missteps
all right.

01:08:48.492 --> 01:08:49.924
[Cliff]: But the reason
this float was on its way

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:50.892
to being terrific

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:51.960
is Andy.

01:08:51.995 --> 01:08:54.562
She and everyone else

01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:58.765
have put their hearts and souls
and art into it.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.301
Look, it's noble
to defend her,

01:09:00.337 --> 01:09:01.301
but let's finish
what we started.

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:04.171
Forget the waterfall,
forget the hydraulics,

01:09:04.207 --> 01:09:05.506
and get the bear's head
back on...

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:06.640
Nothing more.

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:08.243
But sir,
we have a chance to...

01:09:08.278 --> 01:09:09.978
And then I think
you should head back to Chicago,

01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:10.979
and when I return,

01:09:11.014 --> 01:09:14.149
we need to discuss your future
at north lake,

01:09:14.184 --> 01:09:15.250
and whether you still have one.

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:19.621
I understand...

01:09:22.526 --> 01:09:23.424
And for the record?

01:09:24.528 --> 01:09:25.593
I've never met anyone

01:09:25.629 --> 01:09:29.363
who's put more passion
and commitment into her work

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:30.331
than Andy.

01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:01.529
Yeah, so if you hear
of any jobs at your firm,

01:10:01.565 --> 01:10:02.497
let me know.

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.733
Thanks, John.
I owe you.

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:08.770
Good morning,
Mr. baskers.

01:10:08.805 --> 01:10:09.904
Looking forward
to the parade?

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.773
Actually,
I'm checking out early.

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:13.208
I've got to catch
a flight back east

01:10:13.243 --> 01:10:14.075
in a couple of hours.

01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:15.910
On new year's Eve?

01:10:15.946 --> 01:10:17.545
But you will miss
everything!

01:10:17.581 --> 01:10:20.381
Yeah.
Think I already have, actually.

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:21.883
Well, I hope you enjoyed
your stay with us

01:10:21.918 --> 01:10:22.917
here in Pasadena.

01:10:22.953 --> 01:10:25.286
Yeah, it's been...

01:10:25.322 --> 01:10:26.754
Surprising.

01:10:29.793 --> 01:10:32.260
Dad, I'm sorry
i let you down.

01:10:32.295 --> 01:10:33.461
I let everyone down.

01:10:33.496 --> 01:10:34.963
I disappointed the client.

01:10:34.998 --> 01:10:36.965
Aw, honey, you're doing
the best you can

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.466
in an impossible
situation.

01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:39.534
That's all you can do.

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:41.035
But what if it hurts
the company?

01:10:41.071 --> 01:10:43.371
Honey, companies come and go.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:44.706
My life is my family.

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:47.375
Everything else
is window-dressing...

01:10:48.979 --> 01:10:50.144
But when are you going

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:51.246
to get back
into your passion?

01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:52.213
Dad...

01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:54.215
Back into life.

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:55.717
You've been living
on the sidelines

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:57.685
for too long...

01:10:59.522 --> 01:11:01.956
And, uh...

01:11:01.992 --> 01:11:04.392
Whatever happened
with cliff?

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.961
We got into an argument.

01:11:06.997 --> 01:11:08.129
Crunch week.
Squabbles happen.

01:11:08.164 --> 01:11:10.598
This was no squabble.

01:11:10.634 --> 01:11:12.300
He's opinionated.
He's rude.

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:14.002
He's always so sure he's right.

01:11:14.037 --> 01:11:15.303
I've got
a whole list of things.

01:11:15.338 --> 01:11:17.272
Ah, well,
he may be a bulldozer,

01:11:17.307 --> 01:11:19.007
but cliff seems to be
a pretty good guy.

01:11:19.042 --> 01:11:20.742
That's what I thought, too,

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:22.543
but I was wrong.

01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:26.447
Anyway, I am going
to pull myself together,

01:11:26.483 --> 01:11:27.615
and I will see this float
through to the end.

01:11:27.651 --> 01:11:28.750
Sweetheart,

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:30.351
all these years
building floats...

01:11:30.387 --> 01:11:31.419
Haven't you realized?

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:33.488
New year's isn't
just an ending.

01:11:33.523 --> 01:11:35.490
It's a beginning, too.

01:11:37.661 --> 01:11:38.726
I love you, dad.

01:11:41.564 --> 01:11:43.631
I love you, too,
sweetheart...

01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:44.932
So much.

01:11:44.968 --> 01:11:46.134
[Doorbell rings]

01:11:46.169 --> 01:11:47.101
[Andy]: Coming!

01:11:49.839 --> 01:11:52.140
Hey, Emily!
Come on in.

01:11:52.175 --> 01:11:54.075
I'm just getting ready
to go back to the warehouse.

01:11:55.412 --> 01:11:57.345
I thought you should know...

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.446
Cliff is heading back
to Chicago.

01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:00.715
Well...

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:02.317
I mean, what does
it matter, right?

01:12:02.352 --> 01:12:03.384
In the end,

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:05.219
it was just business
to cliff anyway.

01:12:05.255 --> 01:12:07.121
Really?

01:12:07.157 --> 01:12:09.624
'Cause it wasn't
very good business,

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:11.192
the way cliff took
all the blame.

01:12:12.529 --> 01:12:13.628
What do you mean?

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:16.564
After you left,
cliff stood up for you

01:12:16.599 --> 01:12:19.300
and took responsibility
for the whole thing.

01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:20.735
He did?

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:21.736
Yes,

01:12:21.771 --> 01:12:25.807
and made perfectly clear
that he never met anyone

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:28.476
who put more passion
into their work than you.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.513
Just thought you should know.

01:12:32.549 --> 01:12:34.015
Thank you.

01:12:40.123 --> 01:12:40.822
Hey...

01:12:43.193 --> 01:12:45.426
Here to make sure
i leave town?

01:12:45.462 --> 01:12:46.761
My cab will be along
any minute.

01:12:46.796 --> 01:12:50.998
Actually, I'm...
Here to apologize.

01:12:51.034 --> 01:12:52.667
Emily told me
everything you did,

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:53.935
standing up for me
to your boss.

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:56.270
I was just telling
the truth.

01:12:56.306 --> 01:12:58.506
Even if that cost you
your job?

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:02.744
Maybe it's time
i found another job

01:13:02.779 --> 01:13:05.213
where I wasn't constantly having
to prove myself...

01:13:06.783 --> 01:13:07.849
To my dad or...

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:09.384
To myself.

I mean, our float,
it may be a lost cause,

01:13:24.601 --> 01:13:26.868
but didn't a wise person
once say

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:30.505
that every problem is just
an opportunity in disguise?

So we could launch
an ordinary float,

once helped me understand

01:13:55.999 --> 01:13:58.633

never settles.

for a hail Mary here,

01:22:23.773 --> 01:22:25.773
Just the executive I need

01:22:25.808 --> 01:22:27.541
to head up the company's
new Shanghai office.

01:22:27.576 --> 01:22:30.377
Congratulations.

01:22:30.413 --> 01:22:32.012
I'd be honored, sir,

01:22:32.048 --> 01:22:33.447
but, uh...

01:22:33.482 --> 01:22:36.050
Actually, I'm going
to be staying in Pasadena.

01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:40.120
You see, there's a gallery

01:22:40.156 --> 01:22:42.189
that wants to show
some of my work,

01:22:42.224 --> 01:22:45.426
and sunshine floats
sure could use a new co-manager

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:47.261
who isn't afraid
to get his hands dirty.

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:49.763
And I could use
a change of pace.

01:22:49.799 --> 01:22:51.699
Don't worry.

01:22:51.734 --> 01:22:53.033
We'll give you a deal
on next year's float.

01:22:54.804 --> 01:22:55.836
Well, best to you both.

01:23:03.813 --> 01:23:05.379
Here's to
new beginnings.

01:23:05.414 --> 01:23:06.714
New beginnings...

01:23:08.084 --> 01:23:09.883
I couldn't have said it
better myself.

01:23:28.537 --> 01:23:32.439
