WEBVTT

00:00.527 --> 00:03.194
(film rattling)

00:10.213 --> 00:13.213
(suspenseful music)

00:27.183 --> 00:30.100
(soft tense music)

00:35.660 --> 00:37.673
- [Josh] Something
different about this place.

00:38.583 --> 00:41.361
- I don't know, we
never come here anymore.

00:41.361 --> 00:43.550
- That's 'cause you never
wanna leave the house.

00:43.550 --> 00:45.093
- Coming here was my idea.

00:51.240 --> 00:53.833
I miss our moonlit walks
through these trails.

00:55.300 --> 00:59.253
Just the two of us and the
silence, counting the stars.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.500
- Look, why are we here?

01:03.500 --> 01:04.530
Do you wanna walk or what?

01:04.530 --> 01:05.920
- You never wanna talk.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.440
- What's there to talk about?

01:07.440 --> 01:08.453
- I'm struggling.

01:11.020 --> 01:12.120
- Right, okay.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.420
Well, it hasn't been
easy for me either, okay?

01:14.420 --> 01:15.700
You just need to move on.

01:15.700 --> 01:16.623
- I'm trying.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.303
- I don't think you're trying hard enough.

01:21.140 --> 01:23.350
Hey, you've gotta get up off your ass.

01:23.350 --> 01:24.300
- I wanna break up.

01:27.732 --> 01:30.230
(Josh chuckles)

01:30.230 --> 01:31.700
I'll move in with my mother.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.690
- Oh yeah, 'cause she's
always been good for you.

01:34.690 --> 01:36.530
Maria, I know I'm not perfect,

01:36.530 --> 01:40.000
but you and I both know
that you have to stay.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.433
I can try and change some things.

01:41.433 --> 01:42.940
- I wanna believe you'll change,

01:42.940 --> 01:45.200
but if you really want what's best for me

01:45.200 --> 01:47.080
you'll either come with me to the city

01:47.080 --> 01:48.390
or you'll let me go.

01:48.390 --> 01:49.900
- That's not fair to me.

01:49.900 --> 01:52.080
Why should I have to uproot myself?

01:52.080 --> 01:54.850
- We're not gonna grow as
individuals, as a couple,

01:54.850 --> 01:56.913
by staying in our current situation.

02:00.969 --> 02:02.970
(Maria sighs)

02:02.970 --> 02:04.603
- It shouldn't have to be this difficult.

02:15.640 --> 02:18.120
- I just want a normal life.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.360
Be with someone who loves me.

02:20.360 --> 02:24.383
Have our own home, have a
family, a career, be happy.

02:25.950 --> 02:27.000
- We almost had that.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.950
- Are you sure we're going the right way?

02:36.840 --> 02:38.740
- Of course, it hasn't been that long.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.353
What are you doing?

02:45.353 --> 02:46.573
- I'm just feeling restricted!

02:47.790 --> 02:48.827
- What do you mean?

02:48.827 --> 02:52.713
- Just so many disjointed
thoughts flooding through my mind.

02:54.111 --> 02:55.060
- Maybe you should sit.

02:55.060 --> 02:56.053
- I'll be fine.

02:56.982 --> 02:57.815
- Come on.

03:01.774 --> 03:03.080
You're probably just dehydrated.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.790
- (laughs) I'm not.

03:05.790 --> 03:07.030
Why are you trying to convince me

03:07.030 --> 03:08.630
there's something wrong with me?

03:09.778 --> 03:11.828
- I don't know, you're just not yourself.

03:13.070 --> 03:15.360
- I don't know what it is, I just...

03:15.360 --> 03:16.610
I feel like I'm losing myself.

03:16.610 --> 03:18.033
- Okay, hey, hey, hey.

03:19.330 --> 03:20.423
Maria, just breathe.

03:21.860 --> 03:24.530
Okay, you'll be all right,
we'll get you looked at.

03:24.530 --> 03:25.630
I'm sure it's nothing.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.330
- You're dismissing me.

03:28.330 --> 03:29.623
You always do this.

03:30.684 --> 03:32.163
I was never good enough.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.643
I hate who I am.

03:37.210 --> 03:38.640
- Why are you talking like this?

03:38.640 --> 03:40.560
- Why didn't you love me?

03:40.560 --> 03:41.393
Why?

03:41.393 --> 03:43.010
You treated me terribly, you hurt me!

03:43.010 --> 03:44.380
- Maria, stop this.

03:44.380 --> 03:45.625
- Why, Josh, why?

03:45.625 --> 03:46.661
I hate you!

03:46.661 --> 03:48.020
- Why are you acting like this?

03:48.020 --> 03:49.020
You aren't yourself.

03:50.350 --> 03:51.467
We're leaving now.

03:51.467 --> 03:53.406
- Stop doing this!

03:53.406 --> 03:55.970
- I am trying to help you.

03:55.970 --> 03:57.263
- I don't believe you.

03:58.290 --> 03:59.123
- Maria, please.

04:01.020 --> 04:02.293
- I can't trust you.

04:03.240 --> 04:04.340
- Why are you saying this?

04:04.340 --> 04:05.830
You're scaring me.

04:05.830 --> 04:07.360
- I know what you're doing.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.710
You're trying to take me
away so he can hurt me.

04:09.710 --> 04:10.610
- So who can hurt you?

04:10.610 --> 04:12.100
What are you talking about?

04:12.100 --> 04:13.730
- Don't take me.

04:13.730 --> 04:15.720
- I need to take you to a doctor.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.623
- Fuck you!

04:19.543 --> 04:20.377
- Maria.

04:27.770 --> 04:28.603
- He's here.

04:28.603 --> 04:30.160
- [Josh] Who is here?

04:30.160 --> 04:32.080
- You led him to take
me away, he'll hurt me.

04:32.080 --> 04:34.120
- No, I will protect you, look.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.123
- He's here now.

04:35.980 --> 04:36.960
- Look at me, look.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.030
Nobody's here.

04:38.030 --> 04:39.020
You're safe with me, okay?

04:39.020 --> 04:40.517
I will get you out of here.

04:40.517 --> 04:41.460
- How can I trust you,

04:41.460 --> 04:43.180
I don't even know who you are?

04:43.180 --> 04:44.690
- What are you talking about?

04:44.690 --> 04:45.900
You know me.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.600
- Why you here, what you want with me?

04:47.600 --> 04:49.770
- Why are you talking like that?

04:49.770 --> 04:51.012
- Who you are?

04:51.012 --> 04:51.950
- What?

04:51.950 --> 04:52.783
It's me.

04:52.783 --> 04:53.616
What do you mean who am I?

04:53.616 --> 04:55.434
I'm your goddamn boyfriend.

04:55.434 --> 04:56.850
- Boyfriend?
- Yes.

04:56.850 --> 04:57.683
- You're lying.

04:57.683 --> 04:59.310
- No, it's me, Josh.

04:59.310 --> 05:00.143
We live together.

05:00.143 --> 05:02.370
Why do you not remember this?

05:02.370 --> 05:03.287
- Remember.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.303
- Yes, hey.

05:07.940 --> 05:08.790
- Don't know you.

05:16.072 --> 05:18.655
(zombie groaning)

05:20.100 --> 05:20.933
- Maria!

05:29.930 --> 05:30.773
Somebody help.

05:33.150 --> 05:34.705
Somebody.

05:34.705 --> 05:37.288
(zombie groaning)

05:43.374 --> 05:46.374
(suspenseful music)

05:47.860 --> 05:49.170
- [Reporter] A state of emergency.

05:49.170 --> 05:51.070
The population is in hysteria

05:51.070 --> 05:52.660
as a staggering number of people

05:52.660 --> 05:56.460
are inexplicably losing mental
and physical capability.

05:56.460 --> 05:59.214
- [Reporter] An unprecedented
pandemic is sweeping our city,

05:59.214 --> 06:00.961
people suddenly becoming delirious

06:00.961 --> 06:02.411
and viciously attacking others,

06:02.411 --> 06:04.110
spreading the disease.

06:04.110 --> 06:06.088
Reports from other
cities keep streaming in

06:06.088 --> 06:08.338
reporting identical crises.

06:11.456 --> 06:15.611
- [Woman] My baby, she
doesn't recognize me, why?

06:15.611 --> 06:17.015
- [Reporter] What are
we dealing with here?

06:17.015 --> 06:18.750
A lethal viral outbreak?

06:18.750 --> 06:21.114
People are demanding an explanation,

06:21.114 --> 06:23.320
the government yet withholding answers.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.960
Is this environmental, biochemical?

06:25.960 --> 06:27.198
- [Reporter] The rate of deterioration

06:27.198 --> 06:29.099
has been a matter of minutes to a few days

06:29.099 --> 06:30.558
depending on the victim,

06:30.558 --> 06:32.881
yet each case appears to
follow a similar sequence

06:32.881 --> 06:34.398
of loss of functions.

06:34.398 --> 06:36.443
- [Reporter] We've lost contact
with our sister station.

06:36.443 --> 06:39.313
Communication lines are
going down everywhere.

06:39.313 --> 06:41.147
Major power grids are going down.

06:41.147 --> 06:42.673
With the population dropping,

06:42.673 --> 06:44.514
there simply isn't the manpower

06:44.514 --> 06:46.146
to keep up the infrastructure.

06:46.146 --> 06:47.999
- [Reporter] How widespread is this thing?

06:47.999 --> 06:50.457
Do we know how far it
affected the outside world?

06:50.457 --> 06:52.114
- [Reporter] It's been a
week and spontaneous outbreak

06:52.114 --> 06:53.592
has seemingly stopped.

06:53.592 --> 06:56.424
The only new known cases of
infection are from attacks.

06:56.424 --> 06:59.382
Has our immune system adapted
or is the virus weakening?

06:59.382 --> 07:01.906
- [Reporter] Continue to refrain
from contact with the sick.

07:01.906 --> 07:02.739
They appear benign,

07:02.739 --> 07:05.120
but their aggression flares up at sundown.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.690
For now, we co-exist in their world.

07:07.690 --> 07:10.230
Band with fellow survivors
and wait this out.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.063
We can beat this.

07:11.063 --> 07:12.680
- [Man] If anyone can hear this,

07:12.680 --> 07:15.579
we are a small community of survivors.

07:15.579 --> 07:17.948
Over 90% of our village was infected.

07:17.948 --> 07:20.482
By day, the Invalids
keep to the shorelines

07:20.482 --> 07:22.047
in a harmless trance.

07:22.047 --> 07:24.959
But at sundown, they grow
violent and breach our borders

07:24.959 --> 07:26.933
with bloodthirsty attacks.

07:26.933 --> 07:29.200
Through vigilance and solidarity
to a strict set of rules,

07:29.200 --> 07:31.610
we continue to subsist.

07:31.610 --> 07:33.490
We have sworn not to leave the village,

07:33.490 --> 07:35.010
the risk is too great.

07:35.010 --> 07:37.220
And we have not had
contact with anyone outside

07:37.220 --> 07:38.732
since the event.

07:38.732 --> 07:41.020
If there are other survivors out there,

07:41.020 --> 07:43.903
if you can here us, please respond.

07:45.110 --> 07:46.913
- [Andrew] Why do they
gather near the water?

07:49.284 --> 07:52.320
(zombie groans)

07:52.320 --> 07:53.963
It's like they're looking for something.

07:55.500 --> 07:56.750
Did you ever feel guilty?

07:57.730 --> 07:59.835
- [Josh] That it wasn't us?

07:59.835 --> 08:00.668
No.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.803
That's just dad's guilt resurfacing.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.150
I just feel bad you were stuck with me.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.240
- [Andrew] Haven given the choice,

08:11.240 --> 08:14.130
you're the first person
I would have chosen.

08:14.130 --> 08:16.480
- [Josh] All I mean is
that you deserve better.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.433
Me, I deserve this fate.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.010
- [Andrew] Dad's guilt again.

08:25.990 --> 08:27.460
- [Josh] That's probably what did him in,

08:27.460 --> 08:28.583
not the Alzheimer's.

08:32.549 --> 08:34.030
- We can't be an exception.

08:34.030 --> 08:36.179
If our town could produce 48 survivors,

08:36.179 --> 08:38.433
then there have to be
others like us out there.

08:39.429 --> 08:42.263
(zombies groaning)

08:47.210 --> 08:48.043
That's her.

09:00.910 --> 09:02.360
I know you wanted to see her.

09:03.490 --> 09:05.040
It's hard to see her like that.

09:06.933 --> 09:09.223
You're not the only one
going through this, you know?

09:10.530 --> 09:12.310
Use your head and don't be selfish,

09:12.310 --> 09:14.110
you could put the community at risk.

09:15.890 --> 09:16.723
- Andrew.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.650
Shut up.

09:18.650 --> 09:20.600
I'm not gonna do anything stupid, okay?

09:30.410 --> 09:31.830
- Sorry, my boys, you're too late.

09:31.830 --> 09:33.010
I'm closing up shop.

09:33.010 --> 09:34.080
- Bullshit, old man.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.223
- It's not even four.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.450
- We ran out of food.

09:38.450 --> 09:41.080
- Maybe he's hogging it for himself.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.850
(Mark chuckles)

09:42.850 --> 09:45.880
- Yeah, you seem to be putting
on some weight there, Mark.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.030
- No one's getting fat
in these conditions.

09:50.210 --> 09:53.100
We're getting mighty
thin on rations, boys.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.590
- We caught some fish today.

09:54.590 --> 09:56.640
- Thank God that there's still some left.

09:57.860 --> 10:00.980
- Ms. Margot, she was
attacked Wednesday night.

10:00.980 --> 10:01.860
- Did she make it?

10:01.860 --> 10:03.093
- Sadly, no.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.020
That's why we have to be vigilant.

10:06.020 --> 10:06.853
- Fuck.

10:08.210 --> 10:10.920
The Invalids are getting more
aggressive and determined.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.930
We think it has to do with
the rising temperatures.

10:13.930 --> 10:17.490
Refrain from contact,
stay within the borders,

10:17.490 --> 10:19.350
lockdown at six o'clock.

10:19.350 --> 10:20.393
- Ms. Margot now?

10:23.550 --> 10:24.600
- Are you okay, Josh?

10:25.770 --> 10:27.210
- Yeah.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.953
Things are getting worse, aren't they?

10:29.840 --> 10:31.600
- We're smarter than them.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.370
- Yeah, but how many more
people are we gonna lose?

10:33.370 --> 10:36.630
- We're not gonna lose any if
we stick to the regulations.

10:36.630 --> 10:37.610
- What good are regulations

10:37.610 --> 10:39.330
if we don't know what the
fuck we're up against?

10:39.330 --> 10:40.970
- [Lawrence] What do
you know about survival?

10:40.970 --> 10:42.820
You can't even take care of yourself.

10:44.030 --> 10:44.903
- We found Maria.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.990
- So that's what this is about.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.560
I know what you're going through.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.290
We've all lost someone.

10:54.290 --> 10:57.670
But we've gotta stick
together if we wanna survive.

10:57.670 --> 10:59.270
- We don't have all the answers.

11:00.110 --> 11:03.050
- You're not gonna find them
out there, I can tell you.

11:03.050 --> 11:04.850
- You don't know that, Mark.

11:04.850 --> 11:07.290
- Well, let's talk about what we do now.

11:07.290 --> 11:08.980
James Merrilwood's daughter,

11:08.980 --> 11:12.250
she hikes into the city and
isn't heard from in two weeks.

11:12.250 --> 11:15.560
Then the event happens and
he goes looking for her.

11:15.560 --> 11:16.593
He doesn't return.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.420
So what do you think happened?

11:21.290 --> 11:23.100
No one has come back.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.600
No one is looking for us.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.433
We're alone.

11:27.460 --> 11:28.810
If we wanna survive,

11:28.810 --> 11:33.710
we have to support the one sure
thing we've got: each other.

11:33.710 --> 11:36.293
(gentle music)

11:52.228 --> 11:53.780
(lips smacking)

11:53.780 --> 11:54.810
- I owe you one.

11:54.810 --> 11:55.774
Thanks for taking me away

11:55.774 --> 11:57.634
from my boring ass work colleagues.

11:57.634 --> 11:58.786
- (chuckles) You're welcome.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.330
You looked like you
were having so much fun.

12:00.330 --> 12:02.330
- Oh, you're so much more interesting.

12:02.330 --> 12:03.540
Do you try those cheap magic tricks

12:03.540 --> 12:05.392
on every girl that walks in the bar?

12:05.392 --> 12:06.390
(Josh chuckles)

12:06.390 --> 12:08.973
(Maria laughs)

12:10.710 --> 12:12.583
- Only those that are easily entertained.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.150
- You know, I don't normally go home

12:20.150 --> 12:21.723
with guys I've just met.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.160
- [Josh] Of course not.

12:25.530 --> 12:27.223
- Can we just slow it down?

12:29.725 --> 12:30.558
- Yeah.

12:34.210 --> 12:35.210
- I really like you.

12:36.300 --> 12:37.930
- Yeah.

12:37.930 --> 12:39.030
I really like you too.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.083
That's why I wanna, you know.

12:43.510 --> 12:44.343
- Yeah.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.450
I just haven't in a while,

12:47.450 --> 12:51.333
and the last guy kinda hurt me, so yeah.

12:54.040 --> 12:54.990
- Why are you here?

12:58.380 --> 12:59.373
- You're genuine.

13:00.559 --> 13:03.430
(Josh chuckles)

13:03.430 --> 13:06.360
I guess I just have a
good feeling about you.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.160
- Why, because I bought you a drink?

13:09.750 --> 13:10.583
I mean, face it.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.700
You're gonna go home in the
morning back to the city

13:15.700 --> 13:18.783
and we'll probably never
see each other again.

13:20.490 --> 13:22.199
- That's not true.

13:22.199 --> 13:24.782
(gentle music)

13:27.248 --> 13:29.915
(Josh chuckles)

13:32.108 --> 13:34.153
- All right, well, we
don't have to stay here.

13:36.418 --> 13:37.383
Do you like stars?

13:49.085 --> 13:51.835
(water sloshing)

14:09.006 --> 14:11.923
(soft tense music)

14:26.621 --> 14:29.454
(zombies groaning)

15:07.440 --> 15:08.273
Maria.

15:13.860 --> 15:15.350
Maria, I miss you.

15:15.350 --> 15:17.433
- Not moving, not moving.

15:19.270 --> 15:21.053
- [Josh] Maria, hey.

15:22.100 --> 15:23.293
Hey, it's me, Josh.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.123
- Something's wrong, not moving.

15:30.650 --> 15:32.210
- [Josh] Maria, what's not moving?

15:32.210 --> 15:34.263
Hey, what's not moving, you?

15:35.190 --> 15:36.023
Huh?

15:37.890 --> 15:38.723
Hey.

15:39.791 --> 15:41.041
Do you need to find home?

15:42.450 --> 15:43.380
- Home?

15:43.380 --> 15:46.270
- Yeah, home, that's right.

15:46.270 --> 15:47.113
Home's that way.

15:49.689 --> 15:51.129
(Maria groans)

15:51.129 --> 15:51.962
Maria.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.560
I wish I could be with you.

15:55.560 --> 15:56.560
I wish I could help.

15:57.399 --> 15:58.232
Hey, here.

16:00.767 --> 16:01.600
(Maria groans)

16:01.600 --> 16:02.963
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:04.890 --> 16:06.640
I don't wanna lose you again, okay?

16:09.072 --> 16:11.655
(Maria grunts)

16:16.780 --> 16:17.613
I need to go.

16:19.010 --> 16:21.863
Stay here.
(Maria yells)

16:22.740 --> 16:24.314
Stay here.

16:24.314 --> 16:25.147
I'll see you again, okay?

16:25.147 --> 16:25.980
I promise.

16:27.501 --> 16:30.251
(dramatic music)

16:33.450 --> 16:36.283
(zombies snarling)

17:14.819 --> 17:16.119
- Where the hell were you?

17:19.313 --> 17:20.380
- I lost track of time.

17:20.380 --> 17:22.270
- You couldn't see the fading light?

17:22.270 --> 17:23.103
- I'm fine.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.140
- You didn't get attacked, did you?

17:26.140 --> 17:26.980
- No.

17:26.980 --> 17:28.633
- Shit, you scared me.

17:31.298 --> 17:33.290
You went to see her, didn't you?

17:33.290 --> 17:34.123
Answer me!

17:34.123 --> 17:36.130
- Yeah, I did.

17:36.130 --> 17:37.577
- There's no point, Josh.

17:37.577 --> 17:39.210
The Maria we know is gone.

17:39.210 --> 17:40.670
- She's not.

17:40.670 --> 17:42.410
- They're vegetables.

17:42.410 --> 17:44.113
- She knew me, Andrew.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.080
- What, you talked to her?

17:47.080 --> 17:48.850
You're gonna get us all fucking infected.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.030
- Will you shut the fuck up?

17:50.030 --> 17:51.770
I'm fine.

17:51.770 --> 17:55.230
- Please, Josh, you're hurting yourself.

17:55.230 --> 17:56.760
- How am I hurting myself?

17:56.760 --> 17:58.827
- I know how much she meant to you,

17:58.827 --> 18:01.083
and I'm sorry she's gone.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.550
But we all have to find a
way to move forward now.

18:04.550 --> 18:05.713
- Move forward?

18:06.850 --> 18:10.530
We live in that pitiful community, okay?

18:10.530 --> 18:12.180
They're in the Dark Ages, Andrew.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.480
- There's no alternative.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.510
And I don't wanna get
ejected from the community

18:17.510 --> 18:19.253
because of your selfishness.

18:22.221 --> 18:24.090
It ensures our survival, Josh.

18:24.090 --> 18:26.140
- Well, maybe I don't wanna just survive.

18:27.140 --> 18:27.973
- Well, I do.

18:32.227 --> 18:35.060
(zombies groaning)

18:39.291 --> 18:41.874
(gentle music)

18:57.737 --> 19:00.873
- [Josh] I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.420
- Hey, don't fucking lie to us.

19:03.420 --> 19:05.140
- What I do is none of
your fucking business.

19:05.140 --> 19:07.370
- It is when you risk this community.

19:07.370 --> 19:10.180
We were very clear about the regulations.

19:10.180 --> 19:13.360
- Yeah, well, they're
your rules, not mine.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.520
- They were approved by the community.

19:15.520 --> 19:18.110
They've been protecting us,
that's why we're surviving.

19:18.110 --> 19:19.360
- You call this survival?

19:20.410 --> 19:22.530
We are running out of food, okay?

19:22.530 --> 19:24.350
The attacks are worsening.

19:24.350 --> 19:27.190
And we're cut off from the outside world.

19:27.190 --> 19:30.793
On top of that, you've
separated me from Maria.

19:32.650 --> 19:35.423
She's out there, she's helpless.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.570
- I'm sorry for you, Josh.

19:39.570 --> 19:41.763
I know your pain, we all do.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.580
- So why don't you let
me do something about it?

19:45.580 --> 19:47.683
- Not at the risk of the community.

19:49.030 --> 19:51.090
What about that don't you understand?

19:51.090 --> 19:52.833
I'm trying to help you here.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.960
- Yeah, you're just like my old man was.

19:58.220 --> 19:59.893
- I'm not your enemy.

20:01.870 --> 20:04.540
You need to do this for these people.

20:04.540 --> 20:05.373
- Or what?

20:08.736 --> 20:09.986
- Or we'll do it for you.

20:12.230 --> 20:13.580
- You're gonna kick me out?

20:14.590 --> 20:16.190
- Consider it your last warning.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.460
- Go fuck yourself!
- Hey, stop!

20:18.460 --> 20:20.270
- Settle the fuck down!

20:20.270 --> 20:21.103
- Fuck you.

20:22.051 --> 20:24.451
- Are you gonna hit me
like you hit your father?

20:25.320 --> 20:27.377
- He deserved it and so do you.

20:27.377 --> 20:28.997
- If you think that
way, then you can leave.

20:28.997 --> 20:30.490
- You don't need to tell me twice.

20:30.490 --> 20:31.523
- No, Josh.

20:36.510 --> 20:37.860
- Then so be it.

20:37.860 --> 20:39.490
You're not part of this community.

20:39.490 --> 20:40.720
- He doesn't mean it.

20:40.720 --> 20:41.553
- I do mean it.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.386
These people don't know
what's good for us.

20:45.386 --> 20:46.920
- You won't make it out there.

20:46.920 --> 20:49.649
- You don't know that,
and neither do they.

20:49.649 --> 20:52.020
They just want you to
believe in that bullshit.

20:52.020 --> 20:53.653
- You can find out for yourself.

20:55.130 --> 20:56.480
Don't come back, Josh.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.780
You've made your decision.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.714
- [Andrew] What makes you
think you can help Maria?

21:08.714 --> 21:09.664
- [Josh] I saw her.

21:10.940 --> 21:12.310
She's still in there.

21:12.310 --> 21:13.893
- [Andrew] There is no cure.

21:14.926 --> 21:18.958
You'll have the same demise,
and I'm gonna lose you.

21:18.958 --> 21:20.993
- You don't need me.

21:20.993 --> 21:23.576
(gentle music)

22:25.907 --> 22:27.937
(Josh laughs)

22:27.937 --> 22:29.137
You remembered our spot.

22:41.490 --> 22:46.433
You know, the stars only
come out at night. (chuckles)

22:52.650 --> 22:54.510
Why are you wandering?

22:54.510 --> 22:56.373
Hey, hey, I can help you.

23:03.660 --> 23:04.493
Hey.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.130
- Slow down.

23:13.130 --> 23:15.000
- Slow down, yeah, sure.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.360
Sure, yeah, we'll slow right down.

23:17.360 --> 23:20.100
Okay, so you remember our first night?

23:20.100 --> 23:21.400
What else do you remember?

23:23.880 --> 23:24.930
Do you know who I am?

23:26.930 --> 23:30.540
You're Maria, I'm Josh.

23:30.540 --> 23:31.623
Do you remember us?

23:33.720 --> 23:34.683
We live together.

23:38.537 --> 23:39.490
- Home?

23:39.490 --> 23:42.660
- Home, that's right, we
live in a home together.

23:42.660 --> 23:43.733
I'm your boyfriend.

23:45.180 --> 23:46.083
I'm Josh.

23:47.950 --> 23:49.279
- Josh?

23:49.279 --> 23:50.913
- Josh, that's right.

23:51.780 --> 23:53.030
- Go home?

23:53.030 --> 23:55.947
- Yeah, Maria and Josh
will go home together.

23:55.947 --> 23:57.870
But first we gotta get you help, okay?

23:57.870 --> 23:59.380
We gotta go to the city.

23:59.380 --> 24:00.780
- Go home.

24:00.780 --> 24:02.602
- We will, I promise.

24:02.602 --> 24:05.083
We gotta get you something
to eat first, okay?

24:07.903 --> 24:08.736
Hey.

24:09.830 --> 24:10.663
Hey.

24:11.590 --> 24:14.953
So, insects, bugs, and bark
aren't a balanced diet, okay?

24:24.030 --> 24:24.863
- Shit.

24:28.180 --> 24:30.160
- Okay, you need to eat something, okay?

24:30.160 --> 24:31.223
You're malnourished.

24:33.210 --> 24:34.043
Here you go.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.130
You're thin, you're malnourished.

24:45.956 --> 24:48.206
Maria, you need to swallow.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.793
Maria, I'm trying to help you.

25:00.860 --> 25:01.693
Hey.

25:03.755 --> 25:07.070
(Josh sniffs)

25:07.070 --> 25:08.573
Maria, you smell like shit.

25:12.210 --> 25:14.360
I'll get you into some
clean clothes, okay?

25:17.080 --> 25:17.913
Here.

25:19.050 --> 25:21.717
(gentle music)

25:25.190 --> 25:26.440
You don't even look sick.

25:31.624 --> 25:33.374

26:39.558 --> 26:41.750
(gentle music)

26:41.750 --> 26:42.583
Maria.

26:45.090 --> 26:46.440
Maria, where are you going?

26:48.620 --> 26:49.453
Hey.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.050
Hey, where are you going?

26:54.470 --> 26:55.303
- Go home.

26:55.303 --> 26:56.840
- Home, yeah, what does
that word mean to you?

26:56.840 --> 26:58.550
- Go home.
- Hey.

26:58.550 --> 27:00.309
Hey, home isn't that way.

27:00.309 --> 27:01.913
Hey.

27:01.913 --> 27:03.370
Hey.

27:03.370 --> 27:04.490
Hey, we can't go that way, okay?

27:04.490 --> 27:05.323
We gotta get to the city,

27:05.323 --> 27:07.120
we need to get you help, all right?

27:07.120 --> 27:09.120
See those mountains back there?

27:09.120 --> 27:09.953
Look.

27:11.990 --> 27:13.940
Yeah, that's where we need to go, okay?

27:15.780 --> 27:17.030
That's where the city is.

27:18.260 --> 27:19.700
Hey, hey.

27:19.700 --> 27:21.840
Hey, you need to stop this, okay?

27:21.840 --> 27:24.090
You need to stop, all right?

27:24.090 --> 27:25.213
Maria.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.163
Maria, where you going?

27:32.320 --> 27:34.070
Can't believe I'm listening to you.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.450
That is where we should be going.

27:42.580 --> 27:44.380
Yeah, well, what the fuck do I know.

27:45.720 --> 27:46.860
You know, in a couple hours,

27:46.860 --> 27:49.310
you and your friends will
be trying to devour me.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.280
Maybe that's your cunning plan.

27:52.280 --> 27:54.130
Maybe you're smarter than you let on.

27:55.803 --> 27:57.743
You listening to me, at all?

27:58.620 --> 27:59.720
No, of course not.

27:59.720 --> 28:00.633
Fuck me, right?

28:05.286 --> 28:06.286
Oh what now?

28:10.997 --> 28:12.747
Oh fucking goddam it.

28:15.500 --> 28:18.930
Maria, I have to believe
you have greater cognition

28:18.930 --> 28:20.160
than we know.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.480
And I know you're looking for answers.

28:21.480 --> 28:24.150
I'm sorry that this happened to you.

28:24.150 --> 28:26.350
I can help you find
those answers, you know.

28:27.850 --> 28:29.330
Maria, we're way of course, okay?

28:29.330 --> 28:31.440
I can't even see the mountains anymore.

28:31.440 --> 28:34.973
I mean, we're getting further
off course the more we go.

28:37.870 --> 28:38.703
Hey.

28:40.890 --> 28:42.137
You need to stop, okay?

28:42.137 --> 28:43.230
You need to listen to me,

28:43.230 --> 28:45.070
you don't know what's right for us.

28:45.070 --> 28:47.000
If we keep going, it's
going to be nightfall soon,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.150
and we're going to get
in a lot of trouble.

28:51.120 --> 28:51.953
Go ahead.

28:59.663 --> 29:02.580
(Maria and Josh laughing)

29:02.580 --> 29:04.083
- I'm so lucky to have you.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.250
- You could have done better though.

29:08.250 --> 29:09.083
- No.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.490
I wish you could see what I see in you.

29:13.330 --> 29:14.440
- A failing liver?

29:14.440 --> 29:16.083
- No, smartass.

29:17.100 --> 29:20.463
A big heart, and someone I can trust.

29:25.590 --> 29:27.440
There's something I have to tell you.

29:29.870 --> 29:30.703
I'm pregnant.

29:40.800 --> 29:41.633
- Honest?

29:43.470 --> 29:44.303
- Honest.

29:53.470 --> 29:56.483
Don't be scared, this is a good thing.

29:59.750 --> 30:00.583
Josh.

30:02.750 --> 30:04.433
I wanna have this child with you.

30:12.303 --> 30:15.920
- You have no idea where
you're going, do you?

30:15.920 --> 30:17.170
Of course not.

30:17.170 --> 30:18.920
And I'm an idiot for following you.

30:25.900 --> 30:26.733
You cold?

30:34.479 --> 30:36.140
- [Old Man] I feel sorry.

30:36.140 --> 30:37.520
- [Leader] Sorry?

30:37.520 --> 30:38.593
He was a liability.
- Get down.

30:40.429 --> 30:41.617
- [Man] If your foot gets gangrene,

30:41.617 --> 30:44.115
you cut it off before it spreads.

30:44.115 --> 30:45.679
- [Old Man] He wasn't slowing us down.

30:45.679 --> 30:47.900
- [Leader] He didn't have
to give away our resources.

30:47.900 --> 30:49.280
- [Old Man] We abandoned him

30:49.280 --> 30:51.164
and we took all of his
remaining possessions.

30:51.164 --> 30:53.049
- [Man] We leave behind weak bitches.

30:53.049 --> 30:55.700
(Maria grunting)
- Hey, hey, hey.

30:55.700 --> 30:56.860
- Shut up.

30:56.860 --> 30:58.082
I heard something.

30:58.082 --> 30:58.915
- [Man] Whatever, it's
not even sundown yet--

30:58.915 --> 31:00.533
- I said shut the hell up.

31:01.941 --> 31:04.150
- What did you hear?
- Stay, hey, stay.

31:04.150 --> 31:05.013
Silent, okay?

31:06.521 --> 31:09.021
(tense music)

31:16.410 --> 31:19.453
- It's just a retard playing
with himself in the bushes.

31:30.530 --> 31:31.953
- Hey, another Invalid.

31:39.740 --> 31:42.030
- Let's play a little game
with these two freaks.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.360
- Yeah, let's fuck em up.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.993
- Hey, show some respect.

31:46.030 --> 31:50.080
- Let's see what happens
if I shoot off her kneecap.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.390
- No!

31:51.390 --> 31:52.690
- Are you fucking with me?

31:53.829 --> 31:56.240
- No, I'm not trying
to fuck with you guys.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.220
- Why are you pretending
to be one of them?

31:58.220 --> 32:00.070
- I didn't know if I could trust you.

32:01.740 --> 32:02.833
- Well, that depends.

32:03.794 --> 32:05.700
Are you trying to take something from us?

32:05.700 --> 32:06.533
- No.

32:06.533 --> 32:09.020
No, no, no, we're just
trying to get to the city.

32:09.020 --> 32:09.853
- We?

32:11.080 --> 32:12.380
They don't want her there.

32:14.766 --> 32:15.616
Is she your wife?

32:18.060 --> 32:19.580
- My partner.

32:19.580 --> 32:20.780
- Do you still love her?

32:22.510 --> 32:23.420
- I do.

32:23.420 --> 32:25.420
- Oh god. (laughs)

32:25.420 --> 32:28.113
- I'm sorry, but she
doesn't love you back.

32:29.262 --> 32:31.770
A shell of a human is all they are.

32:31.770 --> 32:33.853
You have to stop caring, she's gone.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.400
There's nothing left
of the woman you loved.

32:40.063 --> 32:41.163
- But is there a cure?

32:43.150 --> 32:44.402
We're trying to get to the city.

32:44.402 --> 32:46.829
I've been in quarantine since the event,

32:46.829 --> 32:48.360
I don't know what's out there.

32:48.360 --> 32:50.010
- You don't wanna go to the city.

32:51.020 --> 32:52.680
They're under martial law.

32:52.680 --> 32:56.173
They're forcing their idea of order.

32:57.140 --> 32:58.873
You'll have no individual freedom.

33:01.570 --> 33:02.770
- But can they help her?

33:04.540 --> 33:07.080
- If the New Order doesn't have
your best interest in mind,

33:07.080 --> 33:09.390
why would they have hers?

33:09.390 --> 33:11.950
No, your best chance of
survival is out here,

33:11.950 --> 33:13.283
making your own life.

33:14.950 --> 33:17.323
But you cannot let her hold you back.

33:18.290 --> 33:21.343
Weakness has no place in survival.

33:25.130 --> 33:26.053
- I have to try.

33:28.930 --> 33:29.763
- It's sad.

33:31.180 --> 33:32.013
You're selfish.

33:34.230 --> 33:36.110
- I have to try to help her.

33:36.110 --> 33:37.060
- Of course you do.

33:38.210 --> 33:42.203
Now pick up your bag and give it to me.

33:44.976 --> 33:46.520
- What?

33:46.520 --> 33:49.083
- The bag you left in the bushes.

33:50.430 --> 33:54.150
Pick it up and give it me.

33:54.150 --> 33:55.450
We're taking it.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.790
- We don't need his garbage.

33:57.790 --> 33:59.600
- It's nothing personal.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.163
It's just natural law.

34:03.290 --> 34:04.870
He can go and sacrifice himself

34:04.870 --> 34:06.820
to the collective of the New Order,

34:06.820 --> 34:08.870
but we've chosen to look after ourselves.

34:09.820 --> 34:10.853
No one else will.

34:12.170 --> 34:14.612
Now, the bag.

34:17.630 --> 34:18.463
- Fuck you.

34:24.739 --> 34:25.690
- I wanna help you.

34:37.340 --> 34:42.243
You need to stop being
selfish and let her go.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.632
She's not the woman you fell in love with.

34:50.679 --> 34:51.793
She's hurting.

34:55.900 --> 34:58.743
You need to relieve her of that pain.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.250
You need to end your own suffering.

35:04.296 --> 35:06.023
- This is pointless.

35:08.740 --> 35:09.573
- Do it!

35:09.573 --> 35:10.653
Pull the trigger!

35:11.630 --> 35:12.553
You can move on.

35:19.493 --> 35:22.596
(gun fires)
(man exclaims)

35:22.596 --> 35:24.937
(men grunting)

35:24.937 --> 35:25.770
- Oh.

35:27.741 --> 35:28.658
- Hey, hey!

35:30.217 --> 35:31.050
Get up.

35:32.069 --> 35:33.623
Get up.

35:33.623 --> 35:35.033
- Get the fuck off me.

35:38.590 --> 35:40.040
Oh fuck.

35:40.040 --> 35:40.873
- Stop!

35:42.690 --> 35:44.750
Don't pick up that gun.

35:44.750 --> 35:46.780
- What the hell are you doing?

35:46.780 --> 35:48.630
- You could have avoided this.

35:48.630 --> 35:50.210
- I'm not your enemy.

35:50.210 --> 35:51.360
- Neither is he.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.483
Neither is she.

35:54.031 --> 35:56.614
(man grunting)

36:02.866 --> 36:05.616
(man whimpering)

36:10.110 --> 36:12.230
- Do what you want with her.

36:12.230 --> 36:13.473
We're taking your bag.

36:22.810 --> 36:24.310
Good luck getting to the city.

36:26.720 --> 36:28.093
Don't let us see you again.

36:31.620 --> 36:33.663
- Hey, don't leave me!

36:36.770 --> 36:37.603
Ah.

36:41.219 --> 36:42.052
Ah!

36:44.839 --> 36:47.680
(man grunts)

36:47.680 --> 36:49.880
Come on, help me.

36:49.880 --> 36:50.713
Help me.

36:56.795 --> 36:59.378
(man grunting)

37:04.524 --> 37:07.107
(gentle music)

37:08.987 --> 37:10.430
- Go home?

37:10.430 --> 37:13.213
- Yeah, I'm trying.

37:25.940 --> 37:26.853
- Where were you?

37:29.030 --> 37:30.630
- I was out.

37:30.630 --> 37:32.000
With Kevin and Don.

37:34.760 --> 37:36.600
- [Maria] You don't even like Kevin.

37:36.600 --> 37:37.800
- [Josh] He's tolerable.

37:40.740 --> 37:43.140
- More tolerable than a
pregnant me, apparently.

37:56.837 --> 37:58.910
- You know, Kevin doesn't let
me give him foot massages,

37:58.910 --> 38:01.053
so you've got that on him.

38:02.750 --> 38:05.150
- So that's why you had to come home?

38:05.150 --> 38:06.023
- Pretty much.

38:10.461 --> 38:12.210
- This can't keep happening.

38:12.210 --> 38:14.463
I need you to come home after work.

38:15.450 --> 38:16.513
- I'm doing my part.

38:17.505 --> 38:19.013
I'm taking care of you, aren't I?

38:20.560 --> 38:22.080
- Hardly.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.960
You're out and about doing your own thing

38:23.960 --> 38:25.430
like I don't even exist.

38:25.430 --> 38:29.280
- Well, how about you stop
trying to control my life?

38:29.280 --> 38:31.680
- I'm not trying to control your life,

38:31.680 --> 38:35.390
but you just seem fucking
oblivious to my needs.

38:35.390 --> 38:39.662
I need you to be home with me
while I'm carrying your child.

38:39.662 --> 38:40.495
- Yeah.

38:41.467 --> 38:43.906
Okay.

38:43.906 --> 38:44.739
Okay.

38:45.665 --> 38:46.498
I'm sorry.

38:50.410 --> 38:52.230
- Like that's gonna get you off the hook.

38:52.230 --> 38:53.900
- [Josh] It might.

38:53.900 --> 38:54.973
- Don't count on it.

38:59.050 --> 38:59.883
- I mean.

39:11.183 --> 39:13.476
You know I think you're sexy like this.

39:13.476 --> 39:16.003
- Yeah, right, I feel like
a fucking beached whale.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.813
(Josh moaning)

39:32.360 --> 39:37.086
- Hey, you know, you should
know where the path is.

39:37.086 --> 39:39.036
You've been in these woods long enough.

39:41.180 --> 39:42.013
Stop it.

39:42.961 --> 39:45.013
Okay, okay, go ahead.

39:49.357 --> 39:51.774
(Josh sighs)

39:54.540 --> 39:55.560
No, God.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.763
Maria, don't eat that.

39:57.750 --> 39:58.583
Come on.

39:59.876 --> 40:01.120
(Maria groans)

40:01.120 --> 40:01.953
Okay.

40:03.793 --> 40:06.280
(Maria groaning)

40:06.280 --> 40:07.880
Cut it out!

40:07.880 --> 40:11.319
Maria, I don't have, okay,
I don't have time for this.

40:11.319 --> 40:14.069
(Maria groaning)

40:28.320 --> 40:29.970
Come on.

40:29.970 --> 40:32.450
(Maria groaning)

40:32.450 --> 40:33.283
Come on.

40:35.800 --> 40:36.633
Let's go.

40:40.164 --> 40:45.164
Come on.

40:51.581 --> 40:52.414
Come on.

41:00.410 --> 41:01.243
Come on.

41:05.144 --> 41:05.977
There.

41:34.819 --> 41:37.736
(soft tense music)

42:12.394 --> 42:13.227
Thanks.

42:15.398 --> 42:16.565
- Don't leave.

42:18.297 --> 42:19.130
- I won't.

42:22.790 --> 42:23.623
Come on.

42:38.263 --> 42:39.763
Have you seen my keys?

42:41.290 --> 42:42.323
- Drinking already?

42:43.270 --> 42:44.103
- No.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.000
- I can smell it on you.

42:49.210 --> 42:50.780
It's not even noon.

42:50.780 --> 42:53.300
- And you haven't gotten out of bed yet.

42:53.300 --> 42:55.300
- I don't have the energy.

42:55.300 --> 42:57.720
- That's because you're miserable.

42:57.720 --> 42:59.309
- I wonder why.

42:59.309 --> 43:01.170
(Josh laughs)

43:01.170 --> 43:02.710
- Yeah, put the blame on me.

43:02.710 --> 43:05.770
Why don't you take
responsibility for your emotions?

43:05.770 --> 43:07.410
- I am.

43:07.410 --> 43:09.683
I'm trying to fix this relationship.

43:12.550 --> 43:13.523
What about you?

43:16.470 --> 43:19.410
What are you doing to take responsibility?

43:19.410 --> 43:20.243
- For what?

43:21.110 --> 43:23.733
- For your life, for us?

43:25.400 --> 43:27.630
- There's nothing wrong with my life.

43:27.630 --> 43:31.340
- That's what the problem
is, you don't see a problem.

43:31.340 --> 43:34.853
- Okay, so, how would
you like me to change?

43:35.893 --> 43:38.550
- I want you to be a better man.

43:38.550 --> 43:42.330
- Oh, okay, okay, a better man.

43:42.330 --> 43:45.673
- Stop coasting through
life, stop barely getting by.

43:46.550 --> 43:47.400
- I'm doing fine.

43:50.910 --> 43:53.580
- You blame others for
not getting anywhere,

43:53.580 --> 43:56.320
but why didn't you take that promotion?

43:56.320 --> 43:57.900
- There were better men for the job.

43:57.900 --> 43:59.343
- No, there weren't.

44:00.240 --> 44:02.080
Stop drinking your life away

44:02.080 --> 44:05.223
being cynical about everything
and everyone around you.

44:06.329 --> 44:08.570
- Don't try and tell
me how to live my life.

44:08.570 --> 44:10.620
I am happy the way I am.

44:10.620 --> 44:12.583
- You are bitter and complacent.

44:13.480 --> 44:16.280
- Don't tell me how to live my life.

44:16.280 --> 44:18.080
- Then stop being fucking selfish,

44:18.080 --> 44:20.203
stop only thinking about yourself.

44:21.150 --> 44:23.543
- Don't fucking try and change me.

44:25.827 --> 44:28.244
(hand slaps)

44:29.316 --> 44:31.899
(gentle music)

44:49.154 --> 44:52.071
(soft tense music)

44:53.170 --> 44:54.003
Hey.

44:57.630 --> 44:58.480
- Don't wanna go.

45:00.350 --> 45:02.961
- Yeah, let's not do this again, okay?

45:02.961 --> 45:05.711
(Maria panting)

45:09.650 --> 45:10.923
- Coming, coming.

45:12.520 --> 45:13.353
- Who's coming?

45:15.671 --> 45:16.504
Oh, Maria.

45:42.247 --> 45:44.997
(Maria groaning)

45:48.419 --> 45:49.793
Stop fighting me.

45:49.793 --> 45:51.610
I'm not your enemy.

45:51.610 --> 45:54.842
Stop it, I'm trying to help you.

45:54.842 --> 45:56.824
You need help.

45:56.824 --> 45:59.693
You got us lost, do you understand?

45:59.693 --> 46:02.333
Maria, we have no food,
we have no compass.

46:02.333 --> 46:05.500
We are lost and the sun is going down.

46:06.983 --> 46:09.650
(Maria panting)

46:15.217 --> 46:17.800
(gentle music)

47:24.398 --> 47:27.315
(soft tense music)

48:53.771 --> 48:56.354
(zombie groaning)

50:01.722 --> 50:02.972
- [Maria] Josh.

50:05.811 --> 50:06.644
Josh.

50:09.880 --> 50:11.253
Josh, something's wrong.

50:16.650 --> 50:18.393
Josh, quick, help me.

50:23.490 --> 50:24.323
Josh.

50:26.576 --> 50:29.493
(soft tense music)

51:16.886 --> 51:17.719
- Come on.

51:29.141 --> 51:30.391
- [Maria] Josh.

51:31.530 --> 51:33.130
- Maria.

51:33.130 --> 51:34.053
- [Maria] Josh.

51:36.033 --> 51:37.116
- I'm coming.

51:38.952 --> 51:39.785
Oh fuck.

51:42.225 --> 51:43.058
Oh.

51:54.400 --> 51:55.233
Maria?

51:58.475 --> 51:59.695
Fuck.

51:59.695 --> 52:00.721
Fuck!

52:00.721 --> 52:01.554
Fuck!

52:02.613 --> 52:04.206
Fuck!

52:04.206 --> 52:05.039
Fuck!

52:14.869 --> 52:15.786
I'm coming.

52:24.272 --> 52:28.022
- [Maria] (whimpers) Oh God.

52:58.127 --> 53:01.248
(Maria whimpering)

53:01.248 --> 53:02.748
Josh, quick, help.

53:04.916 --> 53:07.969
(Maria whimpers)

53:07.969 --> 53:09.469
Josh, quick, help.

53:18.922 --> 53:20.005
- [Josh] God.

53:23.389 --> 53:24.222
- Oh God.

53:26.893 --> 53:31.893
She's not moving. (cries)

53:32.820 --> 53:34.760
- [Josh] Hey, hey, it's okay.

53:34.760 --> 53:35.677
- Our baby.

53:38.062 --> 53:39.360
- [Josh] What can I do?

53:39.360 --> 53:41.979
Tell me what to do, I
don't know what to do.

53:41.979 --> 53:42.812
I don't know what to do,

53:42.812 --> 53:44.229
tell me.
- Oh God.

53:48.467 --> 53:49.300
- Fuck.

53:52.154 --> 53:52.987
Fuck.

54:07.132 --> 54:08.215
Who are you?

54:09.177 --> 54:11.717
- I'm a survivor, like you.

54:12.636 --> 54:13.469
- Ah-ha.

54:14.364 --> 54:15.764
And what are you doing here?

54:19.140 --> 54:23.483
- I suppose the same as
you, searching for hope.

54:23.483 --> 54:26.300
(soft tense music)

54:26.300 --> 54:27.133
- Ah-ha.

54:28.423 --> 54:30.160
Do you know where the city is?

54:30.160 --> 54:31.663
- Of course, I live there.

54:36.940 --> 54:38.090
- Why are you out here?

54:40.000 --> 54:44.703
- I know you feel like
nature rejected humankind.

54:46.550 --> 54:49.593
The truth is we rejected it first.

54:51.410 --> 54:53.260
I come out here to reconnect with it.

54:57.610 --> 54:59.870
I've seen it bring out
the worst in people.

54:59.870 --> 55:01.883
Survivors stealing from their neighbors.

55:02.910 --> 55:04.563
A wealthy family slaughtered.

55:06.660 --> 55:07.610
A woman gang-raped.

55:11.280 --> 55:12.920
Just beyond the river,

55:12.920 --> 55:15.343
I found a girl held captive in a kennel.

55:17.380 --> 55:18.730
Another was tied to a pole.

55:19.898 --> 55:21.548
I heard a scream from within too.

55:25.030 --> 55:27.130
You see an old cedar shack, you stay away.

55:33.860 --> 55:35.560
- You said there was a kennel too?

55:36.610 --> 55:37.460
- You've seen it?

55:38.500 --> 55:39.750
- Yeah, I've heard of it.

55:49.410 --> 55:51.353
- We'd best be getting you to the city.

55:59.860 --> 56:01.310
That's us here.

56:01.310 --> 56:02.660
It's northwest to the city.

56:05.880 --> 56:06.713
Let's go.

56:26.044 --> 56:28.627
(gentle music)

56:55.872 --> 56:58.780
- It was our anniversary today.

56:58.780 --> 56:59.613
- [Josh] Right.

57:02.527 --> 57:05.186
- One year since you took me stargazing.

57:05.186 --> 57:07.490
(Josh chuckles)

57:07.490 --> 57:08.653
How could you forget?

57:10.410 --> 57:12.520
- Just 'cause I don't remember the dates

57:12.520 --> 57:14.170
doesn't make it any less special.

57:15.600 --> 57:17.800
- Why don't we do
anything special nowadays?

57:19.291 --> 57:20.541
- I don't know.

57:21.550 --> 57:22.623
Life gets in the way.

57:25.560 --> 57:26.660
- Only when we let it.

57:30.773 --> 57:31.773
- Come here.

57:48.928 --> 57:50.830
(Maria sighs)

57:50.830 --> 57:52.693
- Why can't we go back to those days?

57:54.320 --> 57:55.653
We can start over.

57:56.937 --> 57:59.570
- Yeah, but we don't need to start over.

57:59.570 --> 58:00.520
We'll make it work.

58:02.780 --> 58:04.173
- You're making it work?

58:06.370 --> 58:07.533
I don't see it.

58:09.230 --> 58:10.653
You're better than this.

58:11.940 --> 58:14.590
A year ago, I met a man who refused

58:14.590 --> 58:15.860
to have a one-night stand with me,

58:15.860 --> 58:18.563
who wouldn't let me return to the city.

58:20.330 --> 58:21.810
You fought for me then.

58:29.847 --> 58:31.613
- [Stranger] Just beyond the river,

58:31.613 --> 58:34.946
I found a girl held captive in a kennel.

58:39.381 --> 58:42.131
(dramatic music)

59:09.793 --> 59:12.626
(zombie groaning)

59:27.200 --> 59:30.117
(soft tense music)

01:00:04.837 --> 01:00:05.670
- Hello?

01:00:07.081 --> 01:00:08.498
Is someone there?

01:00:11.853 --> 01:00:13.465
Help!

01:00:13.465 --> 01:00:14.298
Help!

01:00:20.319 --> 01:00:21.736
Is someone there?

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:24.023
Hello?

01:00:26.809 --> 01:00:28.978
Is someone there?

01:00:28.978 --> 01:00:29.895
Help, help!

01:00:46.504 --> 01:00:47.337
Thank god.

01:00:48.181 --> 01:00:50.413
Please, get me out of here.

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:51.500
- [Josh] You're the Merrilwood girl

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.030
that went missing, right?

01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.863
- Yeah.

01:00:55.703 --> 01:00:56.933
I was kidnapped.

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:00.123
I hitchhiked a ride on the highway.

01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:02.303
He was nice at first.

01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:05.123
He touched me and played with my hair.

01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:10.103
He said he was going to the city too,

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:14.803
but he needed to go to his
place first to grab something.

01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:17.483
He took me here.

01:01:21.228 --> 01:01:23.478
- You're the only one here.

01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:25.610
- There were others.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.470
He did terrible things to us.

01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:30.050
- I know.

01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:31.343
I know, Maria was here.

01:01:32.770 --> 01:01:33.603
- Who's Maria?

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:37.060
- She's my partner, she came back.

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.330
- Why would she come back?

01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:40.163
- I don't know.

01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:42.490
She's sick.

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:43.623
- She's one of them?

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.447
What happened to them?

01:01:46.447 --> 01:01:47.427
- I don't know.

01:01:47.427 --> 01:01:52.427
All I know is that we can't leave here.

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.110
Fuck, they're gonna be aggressive soon.

01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:55.943
- We can't stay here.

01:01:55.943 --> 01:01:57.640
- [Josh] The sun's going down,
so it's too late to leave.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.320
- But he'll find us.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.010
- Okay, well, we don't
have an option, okay?

01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:02.700
We'll stay the night and
we'll leave in the morning.

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.070
- But he comes home before
sundown every night,

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:06.320
he'll be here any minute.

01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:11.250
- You'll be eaten alive out there.

01:02:13.253 --> 01:02:14.253
Oh fuck you.

01:02:22.898 --> 01:02:25.315
(fists thud)

01:02:27.486 --> 01:02:30.403
(zombies groaning)

01:02:45.559 --> 01:02:48.142
(Josh panting)

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:06.753
Let me go.

01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:10.020
I'm not here for you.

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.053
- Why are you here?

01:03:12.949 --> 01:03:14.883
- I'm looking for my girl.

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:22.023
- Is she here?

01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:24.003
- She was.

01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.963
Maria.

01:03:31.677 --> 01:03:34.260
(Josh panting)

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.283
Why did you take her?

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:45.003
- They come to me.

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:48.113
It's random, indiscriminate.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:50.530
- Why did you hurt her?

01:03:52.338 --> 01:03:53.887
- (chuckles) Hurt her?

01:03:55.706 --> 01:03:56.930
Is that what she said?

01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:59.510
- You violated her, you sick fuck!

01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:01.700
- Your moral pronouncements

01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:07.723
are a cheap attempt to
understand things that you don't.

01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:10.380
- You're gonna rot in hell,

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.113
you son of a bitch, you pig fuck.

01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.843
- Hell?

01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:16.473
Hell is out there.

01:04:19.571 --> 01:04:21.083
Have the sick been judged?

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.980
- What do you want with me anyway?

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:26.813
- Nothing.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.508
You came to me.

01:04:29.508 --> 01:04:33.000
(soft tense music)

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.963
I just need to rectify your intrusion.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.083
- Rectify?

01:04:50.712 --> 01:04:52.449
Stay the fuck away from me.

01:04:52.449 --> 01:04:56.573
- You will choose the
degree of your suffering.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.304
What have you done with Sarah?

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:13.304
- Oh fuck you.

01:05:14.504 --> 01:05:17.093
(object thuds)

01:05:17.093 --> 01:05:20.224
(Josh panting)

01:05:20.224 --> 01:05:22.724
(Josh laughs)

01:05:27.277 --> 01:05:30.608
(dramatic music)

01:05:30.608 --> 01:05:32.384
- The highway's a half mile this way.

01:05:32.384 --> 01:05:34.640
- [Josh] Move, go.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.751
(zombie snarls)
- Watch out!

01:05:37.751 --> 01:05:40.668
(zombies snarling)

01:06:14.016 --> 01:06:15.183
- [Josh] Stop.

01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:19.010
- I can't let you do that.

01:06:19.987 --> 01:06:22.463
(zombies snarling)

01:06:22.463 --> 01:06:23.938
(zombie howls)

01:06:23.938 --> 01:06:26.308
(zombies snarling)

01:06:26.308 --> 01:06:27.927
- [Josh] Go, go, go.

01:06:27.927 --> 01:06:32.927
(dramatic music)
(zombies snarling)

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.673
Go, go, go, I got him.

01:07:01.369 --> 01:07:04.286
(zombies snarling)

01:07:22.701 --> 01:07:25.118
(Josh gasps)

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.863
(gentle music)

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:30.862
(Maria laughs)

01:08:31.830 --> 01:08:33.580
- Maria, look at you.

01:08:35.267 --> 01:08:36.613
How is this possible?

01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:39.763
- They found a cure.

01:08:51.197 --> 01:08:53.263
- Oh my god, you're hurting, Maria.

01:08:56.911 --> 01:08:58.657
(Maria groans)

01:08:58.657 --> 01:09:01.020
Maria.

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.693
Maria, stop, stop this.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.513
Maria!

01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:15.143
- We made it.

01:09:18.024 --> 01:09:23.024
- Yeah. (chuckles)

01:09:43.710 --> 01:09:47.910
- Thank you.

01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:50.859
- [Josh] You sure you don't
wanna come to the city with me?

01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:55.763
- I have to know if they survived.

01:09:58.950 --> 01:10:00.213
- Hope is all we have.

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:10.433
- Follow the highway, take
exit 13, camp in town.

01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:14.073
- Take the connector, cross the bridge.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:15.913
You'll get home.

01:10:17.845 --> 01:10:18.945
- I hope you find her.

01:10:20.409 --> 01:10:21.242
- Good luck.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.940
- [Man] You don't wanna go to the city.

01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:46.143
They're forcing their idea of order.

01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:50.800
If the New Order doesn't have
your best interest in mind,

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.050
why would they have hers?

01:11:26.284 --> 01:11:29.201
(soft tense music)

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.150
- [Man] Again and again,
this can't keep happening.

01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:33.904
We need to gate the
windows, set the tripwire.

01:12:33.904 --> 01:12:36.163
There has to be some fucking consequences.

01:12:36.163 --> 01:12:38.322
We'll teach these bandits.

01:12:38.322 --> 01:12:40.890
- [Woman] It's about time
these sons of bitches pay.

01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:41.723
I've run out of patience.

01:12:41.723 --> 01:12:43.010
If they don't wanna follow the law,

01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:44.603
we'll force them into submission.

01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:48.758
- [Man] What was that?

01:12:48.758 --> 01:12:51.341
(tense music)

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.910
- [Woman] Where you gonna go now?

01:13:11.866 --> 01:13:13.210
- You think you're tough, huh?

01:13:13.210 --> 01:13:14.730
Making your own rules.

01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:16.650
- You think you're gonna rob us again?

01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:17.960
- Rob you?

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.793
No.

01:13:18.793 --> 01:13:22.000
- Then what are you doing sneaking around?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.270
- Look, I'm just looking for help.

01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:26.103
- Help?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.350
You don't know?

01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:31.360
The state of emergency is over.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.360
We've established order, it's safe here.

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:37.013
- What kind of help do you need?

01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:42.533
- It's my partner.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.333
She's sick.

01:13:46.230 --> 01:13:47.273
- We treat the sick.

01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:49.343
Where is she?

01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:56.190
- [Sylvia] Their actions are
usually pretty predictable,

01:13:56.190 --> 01:13:57.583
following simple patterns.

01:13:59.290 --> 01:14:01.873
(gentle music)

01:14:05.410 --> 01:14:06.243
- Go home.

01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:09.170
- Yeah, she was withdrawn at first.

01:14:09.170 --> 01:14:10.773
Then she got angry.

01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:14.590
Then she got compliant as we progressed.

01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:16.500
- [Sylvia] Digressed.

01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:19.590
Those are the emotions with
which she related to me

01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:24.590
as a young adult, a teenager,
and a child, respectively.

01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:30.743
So much hurt and resentment
after what happened to her.

01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:35.983
- [Josh] So she traced her memories back.

01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:42.130
- [Sylvia] Maybe she's tracing
history to find her way home.

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:53.253
- [Man] They're forcing
their idea of order.

01:14:58.756 --> 01:15:01.339
(gentle music)

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.103
- Oh my god.

01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:07.183
Josh.

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:08.853
- You survived.

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.393
Is she here?

01:15:19.490 --> 01:15:20.593
Have you seen Maria?

01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:24.710
- Why wouldn't you know where she is?

01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:28.040
Why isn't she with you?

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.563
- Sylvia, she's sick.

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:34.603
I was with her, but she left me.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.983
- My poor baby.

01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:42.870
Josh, you were supposed
to be taking care of her.

01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:44.170
- Sylvia, I tried.

01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:46.110
- Why didn't you come sooner?

01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:47.293
I was worried sick.

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.630
- I was trapped in the village.

01:15:56.491 --> 01:15:58.741
I saw her on the outskirts.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.763
I left to try to help her,
direct her to the city.

01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:06.460
She's got a mind of her own.

01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:08.650
They're still intelligent.

01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:15.163
Who are they?

01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:17.323
She's still here?

01:16:18.810 --> 01:16:20.640
Sylvia, is she here?

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.490
- Josh.

01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:22.840
- Where is she?

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.320
Where is she?

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.450
- She's tired, let her rest.

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:28.500
She's in the bedroom.

01:16:29.730 --> 01:16:30.643
- You lied to me?

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.370
- You couldn't take care of her.

01:16:35.370 --> 01:16:37.210
- I brought her here.

01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:39.040
- She came here on her own.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.200
She didn't need you.

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:42.440
- Oh, like she's ever needed you?

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.790
- She was searching for me, Josh.

01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:47.560
The moment she arrived,
she collapsed in my arms.

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.760
- No fucking shit she did.

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:51.000
That's all she ever wanted from you,

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.640
just some semblance of
tiny fucking piece of love.

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.183
- I never stopped loving her.

01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:59.210
I know I made mistakes.

01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:00.723
I wasn't a good mother.

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:04.850
But the past doesn't matter anymore.

01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:06.700
It's how we help her now.

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:08.320
- So what are you gonna do?

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.350
Are they here to cure her?

01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:11.880
- They're here to help her.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.500
- We'll take away her pain.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:16.110
- Oh yeah, you're gonna make
her all healthy again, right?

01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:17.693
- Josh, it's not that simple.

01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:21.380
- Then why are they here?

01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:23.483
- We treat them the only way we can.

01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:27.150
- It'll make it easier for her.

01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:28.160
- Oh yeah?

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.980
What are you gonna do, kill her slowly?

01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:31.340
- No.

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:32.913
Josh, please understand.

01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:35.390
She's dying.

01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:37.811
- She's in a lot of pain right now,

01:17:37.811 --> 01:17:40.000
and it's only going to worsen.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.920
We'll inject her, take
her to the facility,

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.726
and keep her on the serum.

01:17:43.726 --> 01:17:46.210
The neuro-degeneration will be hastened,

01:17:46.210 --> 01:17:48.560
but at least it will be manageable.

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.160
- So you're gonna euthanize her.

01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:53.000
- It's palliative care, Josh.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.290
It's what she needs.

01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:56.710
- It is hastening her death.

01:17:56.710 --> 01:17:58.570
- We're doing what's right for her.

01:17:58.570 --> 01:17:59.950
We can't think selfishly.

01:17:59.950 --> 01:18:01.120
- Selfish?

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.290
You of all people wanna
talk about selfishness?

01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:07.520
You have always, always
been selfish with her.

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.090
- And what about you, Josh?

01:18:10.090 --> 01:18:12.900
What were you hoping for when
you dragged her to the city?

01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:14.650
A return to what things used to be?

01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:17.300
This isn't about you.

01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:19.150
This is about what's right for Maria.

01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:27.230
I wish it could be different too.

01:18:27.230 --> 01:18:30.080
It isn't easy for me to make
this choice for my daughter.

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.820
And it's not easy for
me to see her in pain.

01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:36.610
- [Josh] How long?

01:18:36.610 --> 01:18:39.583
- [Doctor] They can still
live weeks, even months.

01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:42.760
- [Josh] So I'll visit her.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.210
- [Doctor] It's a quarantine.

01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:48.770
- [Josh] She doesn't want this.

01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:50.973
She doesn't wanna be
isolated, locked away.

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:54.590
She still has feelings, okay?

01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:56.690
She came here for us.

01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:59.283
Sylvia, she needs us.

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.300
- [Doctor] We need to act soon.

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:06.623
Sundown is coming.

01:19:08.230 --> 01:19:09.880
- Can I see her before you go in?

01:19:11.528 --> 01:19:14.111
(gentle music)

01:19:24.463 --> 01:19:27.213
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.

01:19:31.927 --> 01:19:33.807
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

01:19:43.522 --> 01:19:46.272
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.

01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:51.603
I'm sorry.

01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:54.823
I'm sorry I couldn't understand you.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:02.923
You're my best friend.

01:20:04.290 --> 01:20:05.553
I fucked it all up.

01:20:19.405 --> 01:20:24.405

You would have made a great mother.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.600
- [Doctor] (knocks) We
can't wait much longer.

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:18.433
- Just a minute.

01:21:41.559 --> 01:21:45.260
(knocking on door)

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:46.093
- Josh?

01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:49.123
Can we come in?

01:21:55.815 --> 01:21:58.398
(gentle music)

01:21:59.938 --> 01:22:03.021
- [Doctor] She'll be aggressive soon.

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.743
We've got to get in there.

01:22:13.331 --> 01:22:16.058
- (knocks) Josh?

01:22:16.058 --> 01:22:18.725
(Sylvia knocks)

01:22:24.409 --> 01:22:25.242
Josh.

01:22:30.602 --> 01:22:33.185
(gentle music)

01:22:59.245 --> 01:23:01.828
(gentle music)
