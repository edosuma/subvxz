00:00.100 --> 00:02.029
Previously on Ghost Whisperer...

00:02.090 --> 00:04.760
Hey,you remember that time I was grinding up

00:04.830 --> 00:06.860
All the egg shells with the fake blood?

00:06.930 --> 00:08.430
For your Haitian Voodoo thesis?

00:08.500 --> 00:10.730
"Vodou." in Haiti, it's "Vodou."

00:15.100 --> 00:16.690
Forever.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.590
If you'll have me.

00:20.590 --> 00:23.660
Melinda Gordon...

00:23.730 --> 00:26.500
Oh,will you marry me...again?

00:28.260 --> 00:30.300
Yes!

00:35.560 --> 00:37.860
I thought you didn't want to do anything formal.

00:37.930 --> 00:39.500
I mean, a seating chart?

00:39.560 --> 00:40.860
Uh,would save my life.

00:40.930 --> 00:42.030
If I don't have one,

00:42.100 --> 00:43.630
my mom might have to sit next to Jim's mother.

00:43.690 --> 00:45.090
And that would be bad.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.830
Wait,your mom is coming?

00:46.890 --> 00:48.860
Yeah. She found out from one of my friends

00:48.930 --> 00:50.260
That Melinda is seeing someone new.

00:50.330 --> 00:52.430
Yeah,and if she finds out that I'm marrying this new guy

00:52.500 --> 00:54.100
And I didn't invite her...

00:54.160 --> 00:55.790
Why would you even think of inviting her?

00:55.860 --> 00:57.460
'cause she's Jim's mom!

00:57.530 --> 00:59.230
Who thinks that Jim is dead,

00:59.300 --> 01:01.690
Like most of your guests, by the way.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.230
Look,if everyone knew that I was Jim,

01:03.300 --> 01:05.030
Then we wouldn't have to get married, would we?

01:05.099 --> 01:06.990
That's obvious. Look,my brain hurts.

01:07.060 --> 01:09.360
Look,we've discussed this,ok?

01:09.430 --> 01:11.130
How can I possibly tell everyone the truth? And P.S.

01:11.200 --> 01:14.300
How long did it take you to realize that ghosts were real?

01:14.360 --> 01:16.460
Ok,you make a good point.

01:16.530 --> 01:17.790
Yes. This is Jim's baby,

01:17.860 --> 01:19.730
And Sam is just this wonderful guy

01:19.790 --> 01:21.990
Who's going to help me raise it,ok?

01:22.060 --> 01:23.400
What about Jim's mom?

01:23.460 --> 01:25.460
And Sam's, for that matter?

01:25.530 --> 01:28.060
Ok,look. We will tell my mom eventually.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.612
And Sam's mom,

01:29.612 --> 01:32.030
We'll jump off that bridge when we come to it. Don't worry.

01:32.100 --> 01:33.500
See ya.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.690
All right,I'm gonna do these errands,

01:34.760 --> 01:35.890
And then I'm gonna work on my med school apps.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.400
See ya.

01:37.460 --> 01:38.430
Good-bye!

01:38.500 --> 01:40.200
Bye! Ha ha. See ya, Ned.

01:41.430 --> 01:43.300
- How's it going?  - Good.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.130
Is that a baby bump you got going there?

01:45.200 --> 01:47.030
Ned! What is wrong with you?

01:47.100 --> 01:48.760
Were you raised by wolves?

01:48.830 --> 01:50.890
It's ok. I'm showing it off. I like it.

01:50.960 --> 01:54.360
Ok,then let me make a note of that for the dressmaker.

01:54.430 --> 01:55.930
Ned,how's the study group?

01:55.990 --> 01:58.530
We're studying, but technically we're not a group yet.

01:58.590 --> 02:00.960
Oh, Serena's not here yet?

02:01.030 --> 02:03.690
Late,as usual.

02:08.259 --> 02:09.860
I swear,I left plenty of time,

02:09.930 --> 02:11.660
But my keys,they got locked in the car,

02:11.730 --> 02:15.100
And I put them in my bag, so it wasn't my fault this time.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.200
Did you bring the chapter notes?

02:16.260 --> 02:18.790
Yeah, they're right here in my notebook.

02:18.860 --> 02:22.500
Oh, my god, where is my notebook?

02:22.560 --> 02:25.400
God, why is this happening to me?

02:25.460 --> 02:28.160
Poor Ned. He's really worried about this test,

02:28.230 --> 02:31.260
And that poor girl brings nothing but excuses.

02:31.330 --> 02:32.830
She brought a little bit more than that.

02:34.090 --> 02:35.200
What?

02:40.130 --> 02:41.560
No.

02:41.630 --> 02:43.130
I'm just saying,

02:43.200 --> 02:46.460
She might be telling the truth about it not being her fault.

02:58.690 --> 03:02.200
Mom? You home?

03:06.500 --> 03:08.200
Dad?

03:21.030 --> 03:22.690
Serena, honey,

03:22.760 --> 03:24.890
I'm gonna be home late tonight.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.960
There's a plate in the fridge you can reheat.

03:27.030 --> 03:31.300
Your dad... I'm not sure what time he's...

04:46.060 --> 04:47.730
Serena?

04:54.790 --> 04:56.930
Ray?

04:59.530 --> 05:01.530
Serena?

05:01.590 --> 05:03.560
Serena?

05:03.630 --> 05:05.960
Baby, where are you?

05:06.030 --> 05:07.830
Serena?

05:16.500 --> 05:18.660
This is Ray, leave a message.

05:18.730 --> 05:20.530
Ray,it's Karen.

05:20.590 --> 05:24.260
I'm at home, and I'm trying not to freak out.

05:24.330 --> 05:27.430
Serena's not here. I've looked all through the house.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.230
I can't figure out where she is.

05:29.230 --> 05:33.237
Damn it! Why can't you pick up your cell?

05:38.530 --> 05:39.238
Hello.

05:39.238 --> 05:42.230
Hello. This is karen Westen, Serena's mom.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.560
Is this Delia?

05:43.630 --> 05:45.930
Yeah. Is everything ok?

05:45.990 --> 05:47.560
I don't know.

05:47.630 --> 05:49.460
When is the last time you saw Serena?

05:49.530 --> 05:53.500
Um, she left here about 2 hours ago,why?

05:53.560 --> 05:54.760
Is she not home yet?

05:54.830 --> 05:57.660
I just got home from work, and her stuff is here.

05:57.730 --> 05:59.360
And she's not,  and the window's open.

05:59.430 --> 06:02.160
Ok, ok, have you tried calling her cell?

06:02.230 --> 06:05.130
Yes, her cell phone is sitting right in front of me!

06:05.200 --> 06:10.890
Could somebody have broken in and stolen... taken my girl?

06:10.960 --> 06:12.360
Ok, what about her father? Is he there?

06:12.430 --> 06:14.330
Are you alone? Um...

06:14.400 --> 06:16.200
I think he's still at work.

06:16.260 --> 06:18.660
I just...I- I don't know what to do.

06:18.730 --> 06:22.300
Um, ok, listen, I want you to get off the phone with me

06:22.360 --> 06:25.330
And call the police right away. I'm gonna come over,ok?

06:34.930 --> 06:38.100
I hope you don't mind me asking,

06:38.160 --> 06:40.630
But can you think of anyone or anything

06:40.690 --> 06:43.030
That might be causing Serena distress?

06:43.100 --> 06:45.100
You mean, something that might...

06:45.160 --> 06:47.100
Make her want to run away?

06:47.160 --> 06:48.760
Could be anything.

06:48.830 --> 06:51.930
Something at home, or has anyone close to her

06:51.990 --> 06:53.100
Died or been hurt?

06:53.160 --> 06:55.590
No, no. We're all healthy.

06:55.660 --> 06:57.660
No friends from school?

06:57.730 --> 06:59.460
Still no word from your husband?

06:59.530 --> 07:02.990
Oh, I got him this... this cradle

07:03.060 --> 07:05.830
That he could put his cell phone in and charge it,

07:05.890 --> 07:08.560
And he just... he keeps forgetting.

07:08.630 --> 07:10.130
We should turn on Oak Lane.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.330
Serena has some friends that live over there.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.400
Ok.

07:23.130 --> 07:26.590
Hey,I think I see her.

07:29.597 --> 07:31.590
Serena?

07:32.100 --> 07:35.030
Serena?

07:35.100 --> 07:36.990
Serena, baby!

07:37.060 --> 07:40.030
Serena,baby,thank god we found you.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.360
Are you OK?

07:41.430 --> 07:44.690
Where have you been?

07:44.690 --> 07:46.330
What happened?

07:46.700 --> 07:48.100
Is this blood?

07:49.930 --> 07:51.660
Honey,look at me!

07:51.730 --> 07:52.760
What...

07:55.260 --> 07:56.360
What is happening?

07:56.390 --> 07:57.100
Serena!

07:57.160 --> 07:58.230
Mom!

07:58.330 --> 08:00.130
It's gonna be okay,baby.

08:35.530 --> 08:36.860
I don't remember.

08:36.929 --> 08:38.789
Was it like someone was whispering to you?

08:38.860 --> 08:40.890
You know,telling you that you needed to do things?

08:40.960 --> 08:42.760
I told you, I don't remember.

08:43.830 --> 08:45.060
I was just in my room studying

08:45.130 --> 08:46.960
and then I got a little sleepy,

08:46.990 --> 08:49.330
and then I was on the street in my bare feet.

08:49.990 --> 08:51.160
Sweetheart...

08:51.830 --> 08:52.660
How do you feel?

08:52.730 --> 08:54.860
Mom,I'm fine!

08:54.930 --> 08:56.490
Everybody keeps freaking out, but,you know,

08:56.560 --> 08:59.260
I just sleepwalked a little bit,OK? People do that.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.590
What about all this red stuff all over you?

09:01.660 --> 09:03.860
It's not blood,mom,OK?

09:03.930 --> 09:06.930
The ambulance guys just said it was some sort of weird red clay.

09:07.000 --> 09:07.890
But from where?

09:07.960 --> 09:10.190
There's no soil or anything around here like that.

09:10.260 --> 09:12.830
Maybe I felt like throwing a pot in my sleep.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.130
- OK,it's...  - You're right.

09:14.190 --> 09:16.260
Let's...let's get you up to bed,

09:16.330 --> 09:18.560
and we will forget that this ever happened.

09:20.730 --> 09:23.360
Serena,sweetheart, are you ok?

09:28.030 --> 09:30.560
I was at the sub's office working with half the department.

09:30.630 --> 09:34.030
I'm sorry,I should have given you the number.

09:46.930 --> 09:49.290
There's seven, you say? That's great.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.800
Your aunt's awesome for getting you that.

09:50.860 --> 09:52.190
I'm gonna take off, ok?

09:52.260 --> 09:53.630
All right.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.130
Hey,Serena, how's it going?

09:57.190 --> 09:58.730
Pretty great.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.900
Um,I just... I wanted to let you know

10:01.960 --> 10:03.460
that I'd be happy to take any of your study group chapters,

10:03.460 --> 10:05.900
if things are intense at home or whatever.

10:05.960 --> 10:06.930
Mind keeping it down

10:06.930 --> 10:09.460
so the whole planet doesn't find out about what happened last night?

10:09.530 --> 10:10.730
Sorry.

10:16.030 --> 10:18.900
Well,that was weird.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.490
Plumeria.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.630
Those must have been sphinx moths.

10:30.700 --> 10:33.290
- What?  - Uh, nothing.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.160
Just be sure to wash your hands.

10:35.230 --> 10:37.390
These flowers are poisonous.

10:57.530 --> 11:00.130
Front door and back door both use the same key.

11:00.190 --> 11:01.230
I gave you 4 copies.

11:01.290 --> 11:03.460
Thank you.

11:06.560 --> 11:10.000
Uh,until we figure out what happened last night,

11:10.060 --> 11:12.490
I just can't be too careful.

11:12.560 --> 11:16.030
I think I might be able to help you with that. Um...

11:16.100 --> 11:18.900
I have a gift.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.630
I can see ghosts,

11:20.630 --> 11:23.290
and I've seen a ghost attached to your daughter.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.060
I...

11:25.130 --> 11:26.800
I don't understand.

11:26.860 --> 11:29.460
Sometimes spirits can influence people,

11:29.530 --> 11:32.460
kind of like hypnosis, which would explain the sleepwalking.

11:32.530 --> 11:34.490
If she's jumpy, forgetful.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.590
Yes.

11:35.660 --> 11:37.560
What's unclear is why,

11:37.630 --> 11:39.700
which made me wonder...

11:39.760 --> 11:42.500
If the spirit is trying to protect Serena

11:42.500 --> 11:47.730
from something or someone here at home.

11:51.490 --> 11:53.330
Would you like to come in?

11:53.390 --> 11:55.190
Yes.

12:11.860 --> 12:14.330
Did you,um,

12:14.390 --> 12:16.530
put these in my locker?

12:16.590 --> 12:17.860
Um,no.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.630
Uh,sure.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.290
OK, like anyone else would know what these mean.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.490
Um,are those plumeria?

12:28.560 --> 12:30.030
And there were moths with them.

12:30.100 --> 12:33.490
Sphinx moths,I-I think.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.830
Does that mean what I think it means?

12:36.900 --> 12:39.390
I don't know.

12:39.460 --> 12:44.830
It just...It feels like someone's trying to send me a message.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.160
You think?

12:46.230 --> 12:48.060
I just...

12:48.130 --> 12:51.030
I wish I could tell them that it's ok.

12:52.190 --> 12:55.030
Look,I understand. You can tell me the truth.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.130
Me?

12:57.190 --> 12:59.830
No one else knows what this stuff means except you,Jonathan.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.600
I understand.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.700
What are you talking about?

13:04.760 --> 13:07.460
Look,I thought it was crazy at first myself,

13:07.530 --> 13:08.760
But...

13:08.830 --> 13:11.630
I mean,last night, the sleepwalking, was that you?

13:11.700 --> 13:13.190
And...and in my bedroom?

13:13.260 --> 13:15.400
Serena! Just stop it,OK?

13:15.460 --> 13:17.530
Why are you being so weird?

13:17.590 --> 13:19.030
I won't tell anyone.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.160
I would never betray your secret.

13:21.230 --> 13:22.860
You're freaking me out!

13:22.930 --> 13:23.830
Jonathan...

13:23.890 --> 13:26.790
Just leave me alone, freak! Understand?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.500
Mom?

14:21.500 --> 14:23.101
In the living-room,honey.

14:24.460 --> 14:26.730
Why didn't my key work in the front door?

14:26.800 --> 14:29.030
Did you change the locks?

14:29.990 --> 14:31.560
What's going on?

14:31.630 --> 14:33.730
Melinda was worried about you,

14:33.790 --> 14:36.800
And she had some interesting things to say.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.100
She'd like to ask you a few questions.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.430
Something happen with dad?

14:40.490 --> 14:42.530
We'll talk about that later.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.060
You did it. You finally kicked him out.

14:45.130 --> 14:46.690
- Serena...  - You know what,

14:46.760 --> 14:48.030
I can come back later,

14:48.030 --> 14:50.560
and if I learn anything, I'll give you a call.

14:53.430 --> 14:55.690
I hope you don't think you fooled me like you fooled yourself.

14:55.760 --> 14:59.330
You can't trust dad. He's a liar,ok?

14:59.390 --> 15:02.100
You can't trust anyone.

15:05.590 --> 15:07.960
So the bad news is, the father's cheating.

15:08.030 --> 15:09.900
The good news is, it's nothing more than that.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.660
So instead of a protective ghost,

15:11.730 --> 15:13.330
We're back to a scary ghost.

15:13.390 --> 15:16.200
Would it be too much to ask,just once, for a helpful ghost?

15:16.260 --> 15:18.100
Yeah,they usually go straight into the light.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.660
I don't think that this ghost is bad,

15:19.730 --> 15:21.530
I just think he's trying to protect Serena.

15:21.590 --> 15:24.830
'Cause he chalk dusted that kid who was mean to her?

15:24.900 --> 15:26.260
Well,he put all this nasty stuff in her locker

15:26.330 --> 15:28.100
And then tried to make her feel bad about it.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.630
Did you learn anything about who the kid is?

15:29.690 --> 15:31.760
Yeah,his name's Jonathan.

15:31.780 --> 15:33.020
Ned did some asking around,

15:33.030 --> 15:34.000
and I guess he's kind of a loner.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.660
Were they dating?

15:35.730 --> 15:36.895
No one thinks so.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.360
Is it possible that Jonathan didn't do anything?

15:39.430 --> 15:42.200
I mean,the ghost could have put that stuff in her locker,right?

15:42.260 --> 15:44.430
Yeah, it's possible.

15:44.490 --> 15:46.460
This is a powerful ghost.

15:46.530 --> 15:48.200
Well,I just need to get the whole story.

15:48.260 --> 15:50.030
Great idea, but from who?

15:50.090 --> 15:51.530
The ghost isn't exactly...

15:53.060 --> 15:54.030
Hello?

15:54.090 --> 15:56.430
Um,sorry to come by so late.If you're closing the store...

15:56.490 --> 15:58.230
It's fine. I can keep it open.

15:58.990 --> 15:59.730
Thanks.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.360
Did you just hang up on me?

16:01.630 --> 16:02.830
Hello?!

16:04.000 --> 16:06.160
So my mom told me that you guys talked.

16:06.230 --> 16:07.960
You know, about the dead guy.

16:08.030 --> 16:11.290
Yeah. Look,I know that it can be scary,

16:11.360 --> 16:12.290
But we just need to figure out...

16:12.360 --> 16:13.560
So they're real?

16:13.930 --> 16:15.800
Like,they're really real?

16:15.860 --> 16:17.460
And they're right here with us,

16:17.530 --> 16:19.690
Like part  of this world?

16:19.760 --> 16:21.860
Like,they can touch things and touch us?

16:21.930 --> 16:24.200
In their own way,yeah.

16:25.590 --> 16:28.530
So they can,like, hypnotize you?

16:28.590 --> 16:30.760
Well,that's not exactly what's happening,

16:30.830 --> 16:32.490
But the effect is the same.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.560
Look,we just need to figure out who it is that's haunting you

16:34.630 --> 16:35.930
So we can help them move on.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.760
Oh. You mean they can't stay.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.000
It's best if they don't.

16:41.060 --> 16:43.610
Look, just try really hard to think about

16:43.610 --> 16:44.760
if you know someone

16:44.830 --> 16:47.890
Or remember anyone who might have feelings for you.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.490
The guy who died, you mean?

16:49.560 --> 16:51.200
What makes you think it was a guy?

16:51.260 --> 16:53.690
Oh,well,isn't that what you told my mom?

16:53.760 --> 16:56.230
I might have.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.850
But does it ring a bell?

16:57.850 --> 16:59.400
I mean, a guy who died?

16:59.460 --> 17:02.060
I'm...I'm not sure, really.

17:02.130 --> 17:03.160
What did he look like?

17:03.230 --> 17:04.260
She said that you saw someone.

17:04.329 --> 17:07.630
I did. Yeah, he was young, about your age.

17:07.690 --> 17:09.530
Really?

17:09.589 --> 17:11.660
Weird.

17:12.859 --> 17:15.000
Well,I wonder if this guy knows Jonathan,too.

17:15.060 --> 17:16.960
Jonathan?

17:17.030 --> 17:19.095
Yeah, Ned was saying

17:19.095 --> 17:21.160
that after Jonathan put all that stuff in your locker,

17:21.230 --> 17:23.790
That he yelled at you in class.

17:23.859 --> 17:25.079
Did you two date?

17:25.079 --> 17:26.500
I mean,'cause it could be somebody who's jealous...

17:26.560 --> 17:28.359
No,no,Jonathan and I,

17:28.430 --> 17:30.430
We were just into the same, like, movies

17:30.490 --> 17:32.530
And books and stuff, but that's it.

17:32.590 --> 17:34.660
That's not what the ghost seems to think.

17:34.730 --> 17:36.730
What ghost?

17:36.790 --> 17:39.000
The ghost that we're talking about.

17:40.530 --> 17:42.930
Or did you think that we were talking about something else?

17:44.130 --> 17:46.360
It's...you know, it's getting really late

17:46.430 --> 17:49.000
And I told my mom that I wouldn't be too long,

17:49.060 --> 17:51.230
So I'm just gonna go, but thank you.

17:59.690 --> 18:01.160
Hello?

18:01.170 --> 18:03.160
You have reached my apology line.

18:03.230 --> 18:05.490
Please leave an apology

18:05.560 --> 18:08.730
For rudely hanging up on me at the beep. Beep!

18:08.790 --> 18:11.000
Ok,I'm sorry. Serena came in

18:11.060 --> 18:12.490
And I didn't have much time.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.490
Try and sound like you mean it. Beep,beep,beep!

18:15.660 --> 18:17.500
All right,it was extremely rude.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.360
Will you please listen?

18:19.430 --> 18:22.660
I mean,how many times do we meet someone who's being haunted

18:22.730 --> 18:24.460
Who wants to stay haunted?

18:24.530 --> 18:26.760
- Not often enough.  - Yeah,she came in here

18:26.830 --> 18:28.090
With all these questions about being haunted,

18:28.160 --> 18:29.530
But never once how to stop it,

18:29.600 --> 18:31.830
And then when I actually mentioned the word "ghost,"

18:31.890 --> 18:34.630
She acted like we were having 2 completely different conversations.

18:34.700 --> 18:35.830
Ok,that's odd.

18:35.890 --> 18:37.360
And I think that she's covering something up,

18:37.430 --> 18:40.430
Because I think this Jonathan guy is involved somehow.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.050
Ok,let's make a list,

18:42.050 --> 18:45.330
starting with weird, random things that we don't understand.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.560
Like sleepwalking, sphinx moths, plumeria flowers,

18:48.630 --> 18:51.730
Flying dust, red clay soil...

18:51.790 --> 18:54.430
What,now it's vampires?

18:54.500 --> 18:55.990
Zoe?

18:56.060 --> 18:58.530
Vampires? No, we're talking about a ghost.

18:59.060 --> 19:01.760
Ghosts and vampires.

19:01.830 --> 19:03.430
And the last time I saw you,

19:03.430 --> 19:05.030
you were asking me about voodoo.

19:05.090 --> 19:07.260
What has happened to you?

19:07.330 --> 19:09.880
- Eli, are you there?  - Ok. Let's take a walk.

19:09.880 --> 19:10.830
Eli!

19:13.430 --> 19:15.360
Hello?

19:15.430 --> 19:17.460
Eli?

19:17.530 --> 19:20.260
Did you just hang up on me?

19:21.190 --> 19:22.730
Touche?

19:22.790 --> 19:25.790
I don't believe it.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.160
You can't not believe it.

19:28.230 --> 19:30.230
How many times have we argued about this?

19:30.300 --> 19:32.730
How many times did you tell me this stuff was real?

19:32.790 --> 19:34.660
Well,now I'm finally agreeing with you.

19:34.730 --> 19:35.930
I want them all back!

19:35.990 --> 19:37.830
What,the cds?

19:37.890 --> 19:39.100
I know you thought it was weird,

19:39.160 --> 19:40.590
Splitting them alphabetically,but...

19:40.660 --> 19:43.760
The hours and hours that we spent arguing about this.

19:43.830 --> 19:45.230
I want them all back.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.660
Well,it's kinda funny when you think about it.

19:47.730 --> 19:49.690
It's not funny. You think it's funny?

19:49.760 --> 19:52.060
No, not at all.

19:53.630 --> 19:55.260
Eli!

19:56.230 --> 19:57.790
You seem angry with me.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.860
No, no, don't.

20:01.090 --> 20:02.620
Don't be sad. Come on,

20:02.690 --> 20:04.220
Please don't be sad.

20:04.590 --> 20:07.260
I'd rather have mad, please.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.690
Come on, look at me.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.150
Look at what a jerk I am.

20:11.220 --> 20:14.450
What a total, worthless, crap-ass jerk.

20:14.620 --> 20:17.450
- But you're not.  - I'm not?

20:17.520 --> 20:19.890
A person can't help what they believe.

20:20.990 --> 20:22.650
And it's too late.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.390
It's too late?

20:25.690 --> 20:27.520
It's too late?

20:28.890 --> 20:30.290
So what's all this with vampires?

20:30.360 --> 20:31.920
I thought you talked to ghosts.

20:32.490 --> 20:34.290
I don't know anything about vampires.

20:34.350 --> 20:35.690
You mentioned vampires.

20:35.750 --> 20:38.490
You listed 5 distinct aspects of vampire myths...

20:38.550 --> 20:40.290
Sleepwalking, moths, flying dust...

20:40.360 --> 20:41.850
Ok,whoa,hold up, wait one second.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.790
What does all that have to do with vampires?

20:43.850 --> 20:46.850
Except the sleepwalking,which I remember from one of the draculas.

20:46.850 --> 20:48.632
Eastern European tradition says

20:48.632 --> 20:51.320
Vampires sleep in soil of their home country,

20:51.390 --> 20:52.850
Hence your red clay.

20:52.920 --> 20:55.260
And in Malaysia, they believe that the plumeria flower

20:55.320 --> 20:57.190
Attracts creatures of the night.

20:57.260 --> 20:59.450
- And the thing about bats...  - Bats?

20:59.520 --> 21:00.920
I never mentioned bats.

21:00.990 --> 21:02.860
Lots of cultures believe vampires transform themselves

21:02.920 --> 21:05.020
Into airborne entities like bats and moths,

21:05.090 --> 21:08.620
But also, lighter things like dust and smoke.

21:08.690 --> 21:09.860
So my ghost is a vampire.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.260
I don't know what you're dealing with,

21:11.320 --> 21:12.860
But what you're describing is basically

21:12.920 --> 21:15.650
Elements from a classic vampire seduction scenario.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.960
- Seduction?  - Yes.

21:18.020 --> 21:19.860
Seduction, when somebody uses someone's vulnerabilities

21:19.920 --> 21:23.120
To lure them into a relationship that only brings them pain.

21:23.190 --> 21:26.820
Oh. That.

21:43.450 --> 21:45.860
Please!

21:45.920 --> 21:49.520
It's ok, I... I'm glad you're here.

21:58.020 --> 22:01.820
It's ok. I understand if you're angry.

22:01.890 --> 22:04.620
I shouldn't have said anything to Melinda...

22:04.690 --> 22:06.690
Or you.

22:09.420 --> 22:11.260
Ok.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.190
Good.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.260
You're still here.

22:17.320 --> 22:20.750
Show yourself to me?

22:24.820 --> 22:27.490
Ok,so Ned called and said that Serena was in school today.

22:27.560 --> 22:30.520
Nothing unusual, except she seemed very happy and relaxed.

22:30.590 --> 22:32.090
A teenage girl happy and relaxed?

22:32.160 --> 22:33.360
We better call someone.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.160
Ok, help me out here.

22:35.220 --> 22:36.650
This ghost thinks he's a vampire?

22:36.720 --> 22:38.890
I don't know, but he's convinced her of that.

22:38.950 --> 22:41.390
All right, now show me this very interesting young man.

22:41.460 --> 22:43.260
Well,this is Jonathan,

22:43.320 --> 22:46.560
The guy got dust in his eyes in Serena's class.

22:46.620 --> 22:47.650
What about him?

22:47.720 --> 22:49.460
Well,I don't know.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.990
Except I caught a small glimpse of him at Delia's apartment,

22:51.990 --> 22:53.920
But the ghost kinda looks like this guy.

22:53.990 --> 22:55.320
You said the ghost had red eyes.

22:55.390 --> 22:58.420
And Ned said the kid's eyes red in the chalk dust.

22:58.690 --> 22:59.760
Eli, wait...

22:59.820 --> 23:01.390
And you said Jonathan's not a ghost,

23:01.460 --> 23:02.660
Which means...

23:02.720 --> 23:04.520
Should we start looking for wooden stakes?

23:04.590 --> 23:06.150
Ok, there's no such thing as vampires.

23:06.220 --> 23:08.020
Believe me, I would know.

23:08.090 --> 23:09.950
- Tell that to Zoe.  - Ok,look,

23:10.020 --> 23:11.390
Forget whether there really are vampires or not.

23:11.460 --> 23:13.790
Can someone explain to me why a teenage girl

23:13.850 --> 23:15.460
Would want to be stalked by one?

23:15.520 --> 23:17.560
Are you kidding me?

23:17.620 --> 23:19.990
Have you been to a multiplex or a bookstore recently?

23:20.050 --> 23:21.090
Oh, I get there's that whole deal,

23:21.150 --> 23:23.490
But what's the appeal? I don't get it.

23:23.560 --> 23:25.760
I... They live forever.

23:25.820 --> 23:29.720
They ache, they yearn and they desire forever.

23:29.790 --> 23:32.220
Right. So that's what she gets from consorting with a vampire?

23:32.290 --> 23:33.620
An eternal ache?

23:33.690 --> 23:35.590
No, she gets undying love.

23:35.660 --> 23:37.560
Come on. You understand this?

23:40.420 --> 23:42.920
Of course she does.

23:45.860 --> 23:46.850
What I did?

23:46.920 --> 23:49.220
Jumping into this body?

23:49.290 --> 23:52.890
Come on. I'm just a pigheaded fool who wouldn't quit.

23:52.950 --> 23:54.790
That's what every woman wants?

23:54.850 --> 23:56.590
Yeah.

23:56.660 --> 24:00.120
Well,then is it really fair you don't share me with the world?

24:01.190 --> 24:02.120
Come here.

24:05.720 --> 24:09.260
Point being, undying love's in short supply

24:09.320 --> 24:10.950
in a broken home like Serena's.

24:11.020 --> 24:12.020
Well,more important point,

24:12.090 --> 24:13.360
We still don't know who this guy is.

24:13.420 --> 24:17.460
No Grandview teenagers meeting the ghost description died recently.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.920
You know what, she's lived here her whole life.

24:18.990 --> 24:20.950
Maybe we should be looking at people who moved away.

24:21.020 --> 24:22.220
Hey. Where to?

24:22.290 --> 24:24.990
Zoe said that vampires like

24:25.050 --> 24:26.520
To keep soil from their home country close.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.820
Yeah,like the red clay that was on her after she sleepwalked.

24:28.890 --> 24:30.990
Wait a minute, there are red cliffs

24:31.050 --> 24:33.660
- Just south of Bridgeport. - Good call.

24:39.950 --> 24:41.990
Andrew Carlin.

24:42.050 --> 24:44.850
From Bridgeport, died about 5 weeks ago

24:44.920 --> 24:47.190
And formerly resided in Grandview.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.190
- Does he look like the ghost?  - Yeah.

24:49.250 --> 24:50.220
Said that he had a blood disease,

24:50.290 --> 24:52.660
Which would explain the red eyes.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.150
Or maybe he got bit,

24:54.220 --> 24:56.820
And that would explain why he started sleeping upside down.

24:56.890 --> 25:00.290
Ok, you keep working on that theory there,Van Helsing,

25:00.350 --> 25:02.890
And I am going to go talk to Serena.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.320
Hey,have a minute?

25:06.390 --> 25:08.120
Now's not really a good time.

25:08.190 --> 25:10.020
I know about Andrew Carlin.

25:10.090 --> 25:13.120
Andrew? What about him?

25:13.190 --> 25:14.990
Well,I know that he's dead,

25:15.050 --> 25:16.560
And I think you know that.

25:16.620 --> 25:19.120
Andrew died?

25:19.190 --> 25:21.660
You didn't know?

25:21.720 --> 25:24.190
How would I? He moved away like 2 or 3 years ago.

25:24.250 --> 25:26.360
Well,I thought you two were really close.

25:26.420 --> 25:28.990
I mean, we were friends,

25:29.050 --> 25:31.320
But obviously not as good as I thought.

25:31.390 --> 25:33.660
So you didn't keep in touch after that.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.835
He wrote a few emails,

25:35.835 --> 25:37.950
but I was never really good at answering them,

25:38.020 --> 25:40.560
And after that, like,nothing.

25:40.620 --> 25:42.520
Look, I'm sorry that I have to ask this,

25:42.590 --> 25:45.520
But were you and Andrew into vampires?

25:45.590 --> 25:48.990
Was that something that the two of you shared together?

25:49.050 --> 25:51.490
Look, I really have to go.

25:51.560 --> 25:52.920
Well,whatever it is that's going on,

25:52.990 --> 25:55.420
I think you're going to want to hear me out.

25:55.490 --> 25:58.390
Look,I really don't think you know what you're talking about.

25:58.460 --> 26:00.290
Andrew wasn't into vampires, ok,

26:00.290 --> 26:01.820
he was into yearbook.

26:01.890 --> 26:04.360
That's how we knew each other. We did yearbook together.

26:04.420 --> 26:06.720
So he just wanted you to think that he was a vampire

26:06.790 --> 26:08.190
Because you're into that stuff?

26:08.250 --> 26:10.590
It doesn't make any sense. Andrew?

26:10.660 --> 26:13.820
Wait, the part that doesn't make any sense is Andrew?

26:13.890 --> 26:16.590
So what,you thought it was Jonathan?

26:16.660 --> 26:18.420
Is that why you confronted him in class,

26:18.490 --> 26:20.760
Because you thought he put all that stuff in your locker?

26:20.820 --> 26:23.360
You said that you two like the same books and movies...

26:23.420 --> 26:25.590
Look,it's not just that,ok?

26:25.660 --> 26:28.660
Jonathan and I both have really screwed up families.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.090
He just...he gets it.

26:30.150 --> 26:31.660
Ok,this is partially my fault,

26:31.720 --> 26:35.150
Because I...I was talking to you about ghosts,

26:35.220 --> 26:37.850
And you thought that I was talking to you about vampires,

26:37.850 --> 26:39.820
And I made you think that they were real, but they're not.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.490
I know what I saw.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.260
I know what I felt.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.950
Ghosts can be powerful.

26:47.020 --> 26:48.720
Ok? They can make us believe things.

26:48.790 --> 26:51.990
But he was with me last night!

26:51.990 --> 26:53.650
I didn't see him, but I know he was there.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.590
I'm sure Andrew was there.

26:55.650 --> 26:58.720
He was at your locker making sure that you got those flowers.

26:58.790 --> 27:00.650
And he was there making sure that Jonathan paid

27:00.720 --> 27:03.420
For trying to hurt you.

27:03.490 --> 27:06.360
That's why Jonathan won't talk to me anymore.

27:06.420 --> 27:08.490
I really am a freak.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.260
Please.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.090
There's a boy out there.

27:12.160 --> 27:15.790
Another boy who has very strong feelings for you.

27:15.850 --> 27:19.420
You can help him go into the light where he belongs.

27:19.490 --> 27:22.120
I can't.

27:59.160 --> 28:01.390
Come here.

28:08.360 --> 28:11.650
Mmm,what are you doing to me?

28:54.650 --> 28:57.290
I gave you eternity.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.160
Doesn't she deserve the same?

28:59.220 --> 29:00.920
Who,Serena?

29:00.990 --> 29:03.320
What gives you the only right to happiness?

29:03.390 --> 29:05.560
What are you talking about?

29:05.620 --> 29:08.560
You cheated death once.

29:08.620 --> 29:11.360
Doesn't mean you will again.

29:26.520 --> 29:29.750
Serena is mine.

29:29.820 --> 29:33.560
One way or another, I'll have her.

29:51.890 --> 29:53.060
Wow.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.590
That's all I can say. Wow.

29:55.650 --> 29:57.650
Have you contacted Andrew's family?

29:57.720 --> 30:00.960
Now that is what I call a dream.

30:02.520 --> 30:03.550
Eli,please focus.

30:03.620 --> 30:04.820
I really need your help,all right?

30:04.890 --> 30:07.320
Look,I'm on my way to Serena's.

30:07.390 --> 30:08.650
I don't have time to track them down.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.650
Ok,but could you just talk to me again?

30:10.720 --> 30:12.720
Just let me put on a little mood music first.

30:12.790 --> 30:13.860
Eli! What?

30:13.920 --> 30:15.020
The ghost said that he's going to have her

30:15.090 --> 30:17.020
One way or another,ok?

30:17.090 --> 30:18.450
In case that means having her dead,

30:18.520 --> 30:20.120
I gotta get this guy into the light,

30:20.190 --> 30:22.350
Especially 'cause she's so vulnerable at home.

30:22.420 --> 30:24.890
I thought you said that the parents decided to try therapy.

30:24.960 --> 30:25.990
- Eli! - Ok!

30:26.060 --> 30:28.620
Ok,I'm calling them now. Relax.

30:28.690 --> 30:31.490
Yeah,I'll relax when I know that Serena's ok.

30:31.550 --> 30:33.160
All right.

30:34.620 --> 30:36.790
I know I'm the one that messed up.

30:36.860 --> 30:39.820
I made you two suffer,a lot.

30:39.890 --> 30:41.060
And that's wrong.

30:41.120 --> 30:44.450
And without getting into some stuff that you don't want to know,

30:44.520 --> 30:48.590
Let's just say that your mom did some things

30:48.650 --> 30:50.790
To push me away.

30:50.860 --> 30:53.250
Karen,is that fair to say?

30:54.860 --> 30:56.620
Yeah.

30:56.690 --> 30:59.090
So how about it? Fresh start?

31:00.020 --> 31:01.890
Can everyone do that?

31:01.960 --> 31:03.690
No way. Forget it.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.060
Serena,honey,please!

31:05.120 --> 31:07.760
Mom, it's bull. He doesn't deserve it.

31:07.820 --> 31:10.660
You know what? Your father is asking for a second chance,

31:10.690 --> 31:12.960
and I think we should give it to him.

31:13.220 --> 31:15.420
That's not fair!

31:15.490 --> 31:18.690
It may not be, but that's what love is.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.890
No, it's not.

31:29.460 --> 31:31.320
Love is supposed to mean more than that.

31:31.390 --> 31:35.390
You don't just leave it and come back to it like daddy did.

31:35.460 --> 31:38.260
Love is something you never quit.

31:39.020 --> 31:40.720
Sweetheart...

31:42.000 --> 31:45.330
We are a family, and family is forever,

31:45.400 --> 31:48.800
And there is nothing else like that.

31:50.860 --> 31:53.160
You're wrong.

32:06.460 --> 32:07.960
Andrew?

32:18.700 --> 32:20.600
Are you doing this to torture me,

32:20.660 --> 32:22.660
Or do you really care?

32:38.860 --> 32:41.830
Andrew,I never got any of these.

32:43.530 --> 32:45.630
They're just drafts?

32:45.700 --> 32:48.530
Why didn't you send them?

32:56.100 --> 32:59.330
You were there the entire time, you never quit.

32:59.400 --> 33:03.700
I wish I could just see you.

33:09.660 --> 33:11.600
How?

33:22.400 --> 33:24.330
Serena,sweetheart?

33:24.400 --> 33:26.400
We need to talk to you.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.960
We're coming in...

33:28.030 --> 33:29.730
Oh,my god!

33:37.930 --> 33:40.060
All right,call any of her friends that you can think of,

33:40.130 --> 33:41.360
And I'll let you know if I hear anything.

33:41.430 --> 33:43.230
- Thank you. - Ok.

33:45.530 --> 33:46.500
Hey,eli.

33:46.560 --> 33:49.160
She's gone? She ran away?

33:49.230 --> 33:52.460
Well,at least there's a chance that she'll change her mind.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.960
As opposed to she's sleepwalking over a cliff.

33:55.030 --> 33:56.530
So what did you find out about our ghost?

33:56.600 --> 33:58.100
I finally got through to his mother.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.860
I just hung up a few minutes ago. I said I was Serena's dad.

33:59.930 --> 34:01.330
And?

34:01.400 --> 34:02.830
And she remembers it like Serena said,

34:02.900 --> 34:04.130
They did yearbook together.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.860
But then after that, stories get different.

34:06.930 --> 34:08.360
Well,how so?

34:08.429 --> 34:09.315
Well, Andrew told the parents

34:09.315 --> 34:11.560
that he stayed in touch with her after they left Grandview.

34:11.630 --> 34:13.260
He kept pictures of her on his desk,

34:13.330 --> 34:15.330
Sent them updates on her life,

34:15.400 --> 34:16.760
Claiming they IMed all the time.

34:16.830 --> 34:19.659
Ok,was there any red clay near Andrew's house?

34:19.730 --> 34:21.094
No. And can you imagine how weird

34:21.094 --> 34:22.460
she thought I was to ask.

34:22.530 --> 34:24.630
Ok,well,what about where he was buried?

34:24.699 --> 34:26.530
Damn, you're good. Almost as good as me.

34:26.600 --> 34:29.900
All right,I called the cemetery right after I hung up with them.

34:29.960 --> 34:32.230
You ready to write down an address?

35:03.830 --> 35:06.100
Andrew?

35:32.330 --> 35:35.430
What's it like where you are?

35:35.500 --> 35:38.500
Is it lonely?

35:38.560 --> 35:42.660
It's so lonely here, I don't want to be lonely anymore!

35:42.730 --> 35:45.260
Then go inside.

35:48.500 --> 35:51.230
We can talk when you're with me.

36:01.130 --> 36:03.460
So where is he buried,exactly?

36:03.530 --> 36:05.900
Andrew's parents said there's a family crypt,

36:05.960 --> 36:08.560
But you should hurry, because it's tight.

36:08.630 --> 36:11.160
There's only a few shelves for cremated remains.

36:11.230 --> 36:13.100
So there isn't much air,then?

36:13.160 --> 36:14.800
- She wouldn't last long. - Ok.

36:14.860 --> 36:16.260
So then which crypt?

36:16.330 --> 36:18.930
I don't know. Just look for the one with his name on it.

36:18.960 --> 36:21.360
How long can that take?

36:30.100 --> 36:33.230
I can't keep my eyes open,Andrew.

36:35.230 --> 36:36.730
Where are you?

36:36.800 --> 36:39.400
Why won't you just give me a sign?

36:40.060 --> 36:43.030
I'm right here,Serena.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.600
You'll see me soon.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.030
Very soon.

37:02.460 --> 37:03.560
Where is she?

37:03.630 --> 37:05.200
She wants to be with me.

37:05.260 --> 37:07.800
That's why she came here.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.130
You don't really believe that,

37:10.200 --> 37:13.530
Or else we wouldn't be having this nice conversation.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.960
What conversation?

37:16.030 --> 37:17.830
The one where you pretend that you don't feel bad

37:17.900 --> 37:20.000
For killing a girl that you supposedly love.

37:20.060 --> 37:22.100
I don't want her to die.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.330
But she has to.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.660
It's the only way that we can be together,

37:26.730 --> 37:28.930
You know, for someone who isn't actually a vampire,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.330
You're doing a great impression.

37:31.400 --> 37:34.530
I mean,the sneaking around,the hypnosis, the smokescreen...

37:34.600 --> 37:37.900
Shut up! You don't know anything.

37:37.960 --> 37:40.730
I know what's going to happen when she's finally dead.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.560
She's going to look back at her young, full life,

37:42.630 --> 37:45.030
And she's going to realize that she gave it all up for a lie.

37:45.100 --> 37:46.260
What lie?

37:46.330 --> 37:47.660
That you loved her.

37:47.730 --> 37:50.360
You don't love her, Andrew.

37:50.430 --> 37:51.700
Love is selfless.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.560
You're only doing this for you.

37:53.630 --> 37:55.660
I do love her.

37:56.760 --> 37:59.900
I've always loved her.

37:59.960 --> 38:01.600
Then prove it.

38:01.660 --> 38:04.930
Where is she?

38:23.430 --> 38:25.400
Oh, my god!

38:25.460 --> 38:27.260
Serena!

38:27.330 --> 38:29.030
Sweetheart, could you just wake up?

38:29.100 --> 38:31.260
Please? Please?

38:33.160 --> 38:35.030
Ok,here.

38:35.100 --> 38:36.300
All right, you're going to be all right,

38:36.360 --> 38:37.400
Just breath.

38:37.460 --> 38:39.930
All right, let's get you out of here, come on.

38:41.900 --> 38:43.000
Sweetheart!

38:46.060 --> 38:47.630
Honey,are you ok?

38:47.630 --> 38:49.300
Are you all right?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
He led her here

38:52.060 --> 38:54.230
Hoping that she would join him.

38:54.300 --> 38:56.360
He realized he had made a mistake,

38:56.430 --> 38:58.400
And then he helped me find her.

38:58.460 --> 38:59.960
And she went along?

39:00.030 --> 39:03.230
He didn't sleepwalk her or...

39:03.300 --> 39:04.660
Or use hypnosis?

39:04.730 --> 39:07.600
No.

39:08.730 --> 39:10.900
You would rather be dead than come home?

39:10.960 --> 39:13.230
I didn't think of it like that.

39:13.300 --> 39:17.130
I don't know what I was thinking. I just...

39:17.200 --> 39:18.500
She was alone.

39:19.860 --> 39:22.730
Andrew says she was alone.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.260
Alone?

39:24.330 --> 39:26.260
But she has a family.

39:26.330 --> 39:31.230
So many people are so much more alone than anyone knows.

39:31.300 --> 39:32.830
He says not just Serena.

39:32.900 --> 39:35.560
Most of us are more alone than anyone knows.

39:35.630 --> 39:38.000
We feel like we're on the outside looking in,

39:38.060 --> 39:39.930
Like we're freaks

39:40.000 --> 39:42.930
Or maybe even monsters.

39:44.330 --> 39:48.760
Till we meet someone who understands,and...

39:48.830 --> 39:51.130
There's nothing more powerful than that.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.200
Does that make any sense?

39:53.260 --> 39:54.800
Yes.

39:58.900 --> 40:01.230
I am so...

40:01.300 --> 40:03.530
So sorry.

40:03.600 --> 40:07.100
I just... I didn't think.

40:07.160 --> 40:11.300
And to just expect you to give me a second chance...

40:15.660 --> 40:17.245
I understand.

40:19.245 --> 40:20.630
Melinda...

40:20.700 --> 40:25.530
Will you please tell Andrew that I'm really sorry?

40:26.600 --> 40:28.260
He was always one of my favorite people.

40:28.330 --> 40:32.300
I just...I never guessed that I meant more than that to him.

40:34.430 --> 40:36.760
I was afraid to tell her the truth.

40:36.830 --> 40:40.800
Because if she didn't feel the same way...

40:40.860 --> 40:44.230
He was afraid that you would break his heart.

40:44.300 --> 40:46.630
I hope I didn't break it again.

40:46.700 --> 40:48.500
No.

40:48.560 --> 40:51.700
No,I think you helped put it back together.

40:51.760 --> 40:53.260
Yeah.

40:58.130 --> 41:00.500
Melinda told me that there's a place that you can go

41:00.560 --> 41:02.230
Where you won't be alone.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.460
He knows.

41:05.730 --> 41:08.130
He sees the light.

41:09.730 --> 41:13.560
I'm gonna be there someday myself, I hope.

41:15.330 --> 41:18.060
You promise you'll look for me?

41:18.130 --> 41:19.960
Yeah.

41:34.160 --> 41:36.960
He's gone.

41:38.100 --> 41:39.730
I'm so sorry!

41:43.400 --> 41:45.600
It's all right, baby.

41:54.900 --> 41:56.460
Come on, Eli, you have to have an opinion.

41:56.530 --> 41:58.000
DJ or band?

41:58.060 --> 41:59.260
DJ. Always.

41:59.330 --> 42:01.430
And make sure he spins vinyl,

42:01.500 --> 42:03.850
But no sixties, no motown,

42:03.850 --> 42:05.000
and no open mic.

42:05.060 --> 42:06.560
And no fun.

42:06.630 --> 42:09.130
I mean, what kind of weddings do you go to?

42:09.200 --> 42:10.460
Same kind you go to.

42:10.530 --> 42:13.160
Boring.

42:13.230 --> 42:16.100
I wonder where Zoe is.

42:16.160 --> 42:18.200
I mean, she wanted to know how this vampire thing went.

42:18.260 --> 42:20.630
Didn't she say that she might miss it

42:20.700 --> 42:22.060
Because she's got a lot of work to do?

42:22.130 --> 42:24.900
Well,I just thought since Melinda was here...

42:24.960 --> 42:28.760
Melinda?

42:28.830 --> 42:30.300
Are you here?

42:31.360 --> 42:32.460
Melinda!

42:32.730 --> 42:33.530
What? Huh?

42:33.600 --> 42:35.600
Yes,yes,vampires.

42:35.660 --> 42:38.430
Yeah, it's just... It's just a dream.

42:42.700 --> 42:44.430
Wow,is it really that late?

42:44.500 --> 42:45.700
Oh, look at that. It is.

42:45.760 --> 42:47.130
You know, Eli, when we're with you,

42:47.200 --> 42:49.930
- The hours fly by. - Fly.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.660
Do you mind if we,um...

42:52.730 --> 42:54.530
I mean, we can stay a few more minutes

42:54.600 --> 42:56.060
To see if she's coming.

42:56.130 --> 42:58.100
Just...will you get a room for god sakes?

42:58.160 --> 42:59.330
Ok, thank you.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.100
You're not fooling anyone.

43:01.160 --> 43:03.560
This place reeks of pheromones.

43:03.630 --> 43:04.800
Ok, well, what about the check?

43:04.860 --> 43:06.660
Don't worry, it's my turn.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.160
Don't give me the pity eye.

43:09.230 --> 43:10.930
Look, I see a couple of guys I recognize

43:11.000 --> 43:13.500
From the econ department over at the bar,

43:13.560 --> 43:16.030
And boy, can those geeks get crazy.

43:17.100 --> 43:19.000
Might have to clear out my whole morning.

43:19.060 --> 43:20.460
Ok. Have fun.

43:21.630 --> 43:22.800
See ya.
