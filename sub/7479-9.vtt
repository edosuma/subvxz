WEBVTT

00:16.015 --> 00:17.881
The plane is ready
when you are, Mr. Renner.

00:18.085 --> 00:19.575
I've loaded your luggage.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.519
I'll be down in a few minutes.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.053
Okay.

01:28.455 --> 01:31.185
Forgive me, Boyle,
but it's just too early for Mahler.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.915
Of course, sir.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.858
Boyle?

01:57.985 --> 01:59.475
No.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.294
What you got there,
Inspector Gadget?

02:35.989 --> 02:38.048
It's an electric potential sensor

02:38.225 --> 02:40.056
that can read changes
in the electrical field

02:40.227 --> 02:42.491
caused by your heartbeat.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.188
Mm. Seventy-two beats per minute.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.697
It's pretty normal.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.425
So it's like
a high-tech stethoscope.

02:48.635 --> 02:50.262
Uh, no, way more than that.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.268
Okay, everybody's heartbeat
is unique, right?

02:53.507 --> 02:54.906
Like a finger or voiceprint?

02:55.142 --> 02:57.406
Well, this sensor
is strong enough to pick up, record

02:57.578 --> 02:59.842
and analyze
your specific cardiac cycle

03:00.013 --> 03:02.675
from a considerable distance,
even through walls.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.580
Wow.
I thought Mr. Microphone was fun.

03:06.553 --> 03:07.850
I'm sorry, who?

03:08.055 --> 03:11.024
It was this toy microphone that
amplified your voice through the radio.

03:11.558 --> 03:13.788
Never mind,
I got a person of interest alert.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.507
The name's Sebastian Renner.
It popped up on the police report.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.291
Hm. I didn't flag him.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.194
Neither did I.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.092
But I did.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.364
Would you look at that?
Forty-six beats per minute.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.305
That's incredible.

03:30.544 --> 03:35.208
Ah. That's tsa lung trul khor,
Tibetan yoga.

03:36.483 --> 03:39.919
Sebastian Renner
is a Swiss antiques dealer.

03:40.087 --> 03:43.488
Not anymore. He was found murdered
near the Hollywood sign.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.488
You'd best rally the troops.

03:55.702 --> 03:58.136
Would it help
if I sang the theme from Rocky?

03:58.305 --> 04:00.899
Ha, ha. Where the hell
have you been?

04:01.108 --> 04:02.405
Waiting for you.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.609
We were supposed to meet,
go for a run before work.

04:04.778 --> 04:08.236
We were supposed to meet
at Patrick's Roadhouse for breakfast.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.440
We can still get in a couple of miles.

04:10.617 --> 04:13.950
No way, I just had
pigs in blankets and waffles.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.145
I'm a little bit full.

04:15.622 --> 04:17.422
You're full of something
and it ain't waffles.

04:18.392 --> 04:21.232
Know what? You get a little grumpy
when your blood sugar gets low. Yeah.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.286
Hetty wants everyone in ops, ASAP.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.431
All right, we're on our way.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.661
- Hey, hold on, let me get a towel.
- For what?

04:28.836 --> 04:30.997
- This is nice leather.
- Ha, ha.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.301
It's nice.

04:46.186 --> 04:47.778
Morning, sunshine.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.013
You lied to me.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.549
Not so much as a hello?
I even called you sunshine.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.282
- You said you needed a ride.
- I do.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.485
Deeks, I'm your partner,
not your chauffeur.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.129
Thought you were having
car trouble.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.389
Nope.

05:00.033 --> 05:03.298
- What are you doing?
- Hm?

05:06.807 --> 05:09.298
- Please tell me you didn't.
- What?

05:09.510 --> 05:12.035
- Oh, my God, you're using me as bait.
- No, no, no, not bait.

05:12.212 --> 05:14.203
As a wingman.
This is what partners do.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.314
Do you know
how utterly unprofessional this is?

05:16.517 --> 05:17.779
You should tell me.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.043
- What?
- Don't stop.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.550
Keep telling me, get mad.
Act like we're breaking up.

05:21.788 --> 05:23.653
- Are you for real?
- Partner?

05:27.027 --> 05:29.222
Oh, come on, sunshine.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.590
- Wait.
- Stay away from me, it's over.

05:31.798 --> 05:33.095
I can't do this anymore.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.733
Listen, I'm sorry, all right?

05:35.903 --> 05:38.736
I know that it's tough
when I'm on the road all the time,

05:38.906 --> 05:41.739
touring with the band.

05:43.443 --> 05:45.274
I don't care about that.

05:45.445 --> 05:47.208
You cheated on me.

05:48.515 --> 05:49.880
With my brother.

05:56.924 --> 06:00.951
Ha-ha-ha. Mm. That's just mean.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.198
In addition
to his antiques dealership,

06:08.402 --> 06:12.099
Sebastian Renner
was also a known black marketeer.

06:12.339 --> 06:13.772
Eric?

06:15.275 --> 06:17.635
The footage you're watching
is from a surveillance perimeter

06:17.744 --> 06:18.836
around the Hollywood sign.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.344
- No, no. Unh. Unh.
- Police are still on the scene.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.548
That looks like an execution.

06:23.750 --> 06:26.446
Yeah, but they're also looking
for something.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.554
Apparently, Renner used
his antiques dealership

06:28.722 --> 06:31.384
as a front for brokering
some major arms deals.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.618
He specialized in weapons,
salvaged and stolen,

06:34.861 --> 06:36.852
following the break-up
of the Soviet Union.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.430
Finding out
who killed Renner is secondary

06:39.600 --> 06:43.297
to finding his little black book
of weapon buyers and sellers.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.063
Every spook and his brother
will be looking for that intel

06:47.240 --> 06:49.265
and we need to find it first.

06:49.476 --> 06:51.103
What if the men
that killed him have it?

06:51.311 --> 06:53.677
Then we get it back.

06:54.514 --> 06:55.572
Hold on a second.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.576
That's it?

06:57.784 --> 06:59.081
End of discussion?

06:59.286 --> 07:01.015
The clock is ticking, Mr. Callen.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.313
And you're already late for the party.

07:03.523 --> 07:05.957
Any further queries will have to wait.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.656
Deeks and Kensi, see what you can
learn from L.A.P.D. At the crime scene.

07:12.899 --> 07:14.628
Sam and I will take Renner's house.

07:17.704 --> 07:18.762
Problem?

07:19.339 --> 07:20.772
No, we're cool.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.535
Yeah, you're so the opposite of cool.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.041
So that's hot?

07:25.212 --> 07:28.045
So you think I'm hot. It's cool.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.148
Morning, Ray.

07:52.372 --> 07:55.307
Guess who's here
to see you, Mr. Cole?

07:55.509 --> 07:57.500
J. Edgar Hoover?

07:59.646 --> 08:02.513
We don't usually get to see you
during the week, Mrs. Cole.

08:04.184 --> 08:07.585
I thought I'd surprise my husband.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.829
Looks like we beat L.A.P.D. Here,
but somebody else beat us.

08:24.003 --> 08:28.702
- Hetty's right, we're late for the party.
- Huh.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.109
Mouton Rothschild Pauillac.

08:39.318 --> 08:43.380
Very fine, very rare. Very expensive.

08:43.623 --> 08:44.954
Maybe Renner was celebrating.

08:45.124 --> 08:47.285
Maybe Sebastian Renner
knew his time was running short

08:47.460 --> 08:48.940
and wanted to enjoy it
while he could.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.394
What's missing from this picture?

08:52.632 --> 08:55.499
Printer, scanner, cables. No computer.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.861
Speaking of missing pictures...

09:04.177 --> 09:06.042
Renner had no family.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.873
These must all be friends
or associates.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.316
What was in this one?

09:14.687 --> 09:16.018
This guy's in a lot of them.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.709
Probably a pretty good place to start.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.086
- Yo.
- Eric.

09:22.261 --> 09:23.853
Callen's sending you
some photographs.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.190
Need to identify the players.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.765
Concentrate on a guy in his 30s
who appears the most.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.024
Got it.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.362
Federal agents.

09:30.536 --> 09:31.833
Come out with your hands up.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.102
Hey, boys, how you doing?

09:38.544 --> 09:40.011
Easy. Easy.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.346
You're good doggies, aren't you?

09:42.515 --> 09:43.914
Yes, you are.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.575
How are those waffles
feeling right about now?

10:10.676 --> 10:12.940
Ha. You know what's really funny?

10:13.112 --> 10:14.477
Your car is still in there.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.712
What's all this?

10:21.888 --> 10:23.480
Sebastian Renner's personal effects.

10:23.689 --> 10:26.157
L.A.P.D. Was more than happy
to hand the case over.

10:26.325 --> 10:28.293
Two less homicides
for them to worry about.

10:28.494 --> 10:29.552
No cell phone or laptop?

10:29.729 --> 10:32.459
Well, if he had either,
the killers must have grabbed them.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.156
I'll see what I can find

10:34.333 --> 10:37.063
in terms of phone,
Internet and travel records.

10:37.270 --> 10:40.262
- Who is this with Renner?
- That's Sander Lee.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.273
Callen and Sam found his photo
all over Renner's house.

10:43.443 --> 10:44.923
He's an interior designer
here in L.A.

10:45.011 --> 10:46.811
He's got a store
at the Pacific Design Center.

10:46.946 --> 10:50.473
- Could be a client.
- Or something a little more significant.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.683
Call Callen,
let him know what you found.

10:53.853 --> 10:54.911
Where's Hetty?

10:55.154 --> 10:57.452
Uh, she left right after
this morning's briefing.

10:57.623 --> 10:59.215
She didn't say where she was going.

11:01.427 --> 11:05.921
"They wrenched the flag
furiously from the dead man,

11:06.098 --> 11:08.259
and as they turned again,

11:08.434 --> 11:12.393
the corpse swayed forward
with bowed head,

11:12.872 --> 11:15.306
one arm swung high,

11:15.475 --> 11:17.466
and the curved hand fell

11:17.643 --> 11:22.137
with heavy protest
on the friend's unheeding shoulder."

11:32.825 --> 11:36.556
Sebastian Renner
passed away this morning.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.453
Do you remember him?

11:40.666 --> 11:43.794
He was an antique dealer.

11:45.271 --> 11:47.000
Among other things.

11:47.807 --> 11:52.471
I believe you had dealings
with him in the past.

11:52.778 --> 11:54.712
Did I?

11:56.516 --> 11:57.540
Yes.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.848
I don't remember.

12:01.587 --> 12:05.887
He helped smuggle you
into this country

12:06.359 --> 12:09.851
in exchange
for a book you gave him.

12:10.363 --> 12:15.801
A book in which you'd recorded
information about your past.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.664
I told you, I don't remember.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.064
Well, Renner is dead.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.539
He was murdered.

12:26.879 --> 12:30.440
You could be next,
if they were to find you.

12:31.250 --> 12:35.050
I would prefer death over this.

12:35.388 --> 12:40.826
That should come
as no surprise to you, Sylvia.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.452
No.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.492
What surprises me

12:45.665 --> 12:48.691
is that you haven't asked
who killed Renner or why.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.062
Perhaps I don't care.

12:51.237 --> 12:54.070
Or perhaps you know who killed him,

12:54.273 --> 12:58.369
and perhaps you remember a lot more
than you're telling me.

12:58.578 --> 13:02.639
I am tired of being your prisoner.

13:06.485 --> 13:08.077
It's okay, Mr. Cole.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.413
Just try and relax.

13:10.156 --> 13:11.987
- I'm sorry.
- It's quite all right.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.718
He gets frustrated sometimes.

13:14.894 --> 13:16.225
Yes.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.921
Perhaps it's best
if you go back in and rest, dear.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.431
I'll come back later.

13:40.519 --> 13:41.816
This place is enormous.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.752
One-point-two million square feet.

13:44.957 --> 13:47.824
You've never been
to the Pacific Design Center?

13:48.628 --> 13:51.791
Look who I'm asking.
Of course you've never been here.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.170
That's a nice chair.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.843
What do you know?
You don't own any furniture.

14:06.045 --> 14:09.344
- Well, maybe it's time I get a chair.
- Yeah?

14:11.550 --> 14:13.950
Thirty-seven hundred dollars.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.985
I don't need a chair.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.885
Sander Lee Design.

14:20.059 --> 14:22.118
This is it through here.

14:25.131 --> 14:26.962
How much did you give him?

14:27.166 --> 14:28.861
The usual.

14:29.068 --> 14:31.559
He must have had a reaction.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.497
Pulse is weak.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.970
Federal agents.

14:39.245 --> 14:40.872
Go. Go quickly.

14:43.749 --> 14:45.512
He's got a pulse but it's thready.

14:46.018 --> 14:47.076
Stay with him.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.395
- Drop the gun.
- Unh!

14:59.598 --> 15:01.759
Drop it. Now.

15:02.001 --> 15:03.662
Okay.

15:03.869 --> 15:05.029
Okay.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.582
- Did you get them?
- One of them got away.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.017
The other one needs an ambulance.
He gonna make it?

15:36.035 --> 15:38.697
- What's the word on Sander Lee?
- Guy's in critical condition.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.965
He would have been dead if it hadn't
been for Sam keeping him alive.

15:42.141 --> 15:43.506
He's not out of the woods yet.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.974
The doctor said they pumped him
full of narco-synthetic.

15:46.145 --> 15:47.169
A truth serum?

15:47.346 --> 15:49.405
They thought he knew
where Renner's black book was.

15:49.648 --> 15:51.639
This book of Renner's
must be one hell of a read

15:51.817 --> 15:53.857
if they're willing
to keep killing people to get it.

15:54.053 --> 15:56.214
- You find anything?
- I talked to Sander's parents.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.322
They're flying in
from Phoenix to be with him.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.268
They did confirm
that he'd been in a relationship

16:00.292 --> 16:02.487
with Sebastian Renner
for the past several years.

16:03.429 --> 16:04.487
Eric, what do you got?

16:04.663 --> 16:06.995
I managed to ID
the two men from Sander Lee's.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.061
The dead guy is Dars Talbert.

16:10.236 --> 16:13.137
The guy you wounded
and captured is one Frederick Harbin.

16:13.339 --> 16:16.365
Both in the country
as agricultural attachés,

16:16.542 --> 16:18.772
but are suspected
of being Bundesnachrichtendienst.

16:19.278 --> 16:20.370
Gesundheit.

16:20.579 --> 16:23.047
BND is the German Federal
Intelligence Service.

16:23.249 --> 16:26.013
- A.k.a., spies.
- Just became an international incident.

16:26.218 --> 16:28.880
There is a bright side. If these guys
are interrogating Sander Lee,

16:29.054 --> 16:30.494
they're still looking for something.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.423
He's right. Maybe they didn't find
Sebastian Renner's black book.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.594
Then again, they are Germans.
Could be just getting their kink on.

16:36.795 --> 16:39.093
- I'm half German.
- I can see that.

16:39.265 --> 16:41.358
Director Vance is on the phone.

16:41.533 --> 16:43.694
- Where the hell is Hetty?
- I'm right here.

16:45.104 --> 16:48.972
Let me deal with the director.
I'll meet you in ops in 10 minutes.

16:49.208 --> 16:53.736
Eric, access a file
that's called, "Dinner Party 76."

16:53.946 --> 17:00.681
The password is Haruspex 77981.

17:03.122 --> 17:05.954
- "Dinner 76" mean anything to you?
- Not a clue.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.752
It's buried
in a bunch of administration folders.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.258
What's that password code?

17:10.462 --> 17:12.123
Haruspex 77981.

17:12.498 --> 17:13.556
In ancient Rome,

17:13.732 --> 17:16.132
a Haruspex was someone
who could predict the future

17:16.301 --> 17:19.794
by reading the entrails
of sacrificed sheep.

17:20.638 --> 17:23.506
You don't think that Hetty...

17:23.709 --> 17:24.903
Okay, here it is.

17:25.277 --> 17:28.838
It's a surveillance folder
on Bernstrom Kohl.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.979
Bernstrom Kohl.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.643
- The guy was Staatssecherheit.
- Gesundheit.

17:37.323 --> 17:38.950
Just wait for it. Rule of threes.

17:39.124 --> 17:41.092
Third time's gonna be hilarious,
I promise you.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.424
Stasi were the East German Secret
Police during the Cold War.

17:44.630 --> 17:45.858
Cold War ended 20 years ago.

17:46.031 --> 17:47.862
Seems to me
like it's heating up again.

17:48.867 --> 17:52.098
Bernstrom Kohl was a rising star
in the former Soviet Republic

17:52.271 --> 17:54.796
before running
into some trouble with his superiors.

17:55.007 --> 17:58.443
Apparently, he had a little black book
on some of his fellow Stasi operatives

17:58.610 --> 18:01.010
as well as foreign agents
from numerous countries.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.349
The little black book Sebastian Renner
ostensibly possessed.

18:04.550 --> 18:07.644
Kohl allegedly had evidence
of some of the more infamous,

18:07.820 --> 18:12.450
albeit secret, operations
of the KGB, the U.S. And Israel,

18:12.658 --> 18:14.819
including assassinations.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.520
That's one hell of a dinner party.

18:16.695 --> 18:19.186
So why would Hetty tell us
this book is a list of arms dealers?

18:21.033 --> 18:24.560
Because the actual specifics
of the book

18:24.770 --> 18:28.536
are way beyond
all of our pay grades, Ms. Blye.

18:28.707 --> 18:30.334
Where did Renner get the book?

18:30.509 --> 18:33.910
Bernstrom Kohl traded the information
to our friend Renner

18:34.079 --> 18:36.206
for safe passage to the West.

18:36.415 --> 18:41.011
Renner kept the book
as a sort of get-out-of-jail-free card.

18:41.186 --> 18:44.485
Nobody wanted to risk that information
leaking out so they left him alone.

18:44.690 --> 18:46.180
So why did the Germans
whack him now?

18:46.358 --> 18:48.656
Ah. One never knows
with the Germans.

18:48.827 --> 18:49.885
Psh. Right.

18:50.095 --> 18:51.722
Come on guys, I'm right here.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.160
Apologies, Herr Beale.

18:55.534 --> 18:58.054
- Where's Bernstrom Kohl now?
- He's been living in this country

18:58.170 --> 19:02.607
for several years under the name
Branston Cole, C-O-L-E.

19:03.108 --> 19:05.042
He had a stroke a while back

19:05.210 --> 19:08.043
which left him crippled
and legally blind.

19:08.247 --> 19:12.946
It may have contributed to early onset
Alzheimer's, but that's debatable.

19:13.185 --> 19:15.176
He's waiting in the boatshed.

19:15.387 --> 19:19.915
Question Cole, see if you can get
anything useful out of him.

19:21.760 --> 19:27.221
Oh. I had animal control move
the dogs from Renner's property.

19:27.433 --> 19:32.268
Perhaps Ms. Blye and Mr. Deeks
can have a more thorough search.

19:32.471 --> 19:34.871
- Absolutely.
- Done.

19:36.442 --> 19:38.103
Hetty.

19:38.277 --> 19:40.404
Do you have some sort of plan
you wanna share?

19:40.612 --> 19:44.378
Yes, my plan is to prevent
an onslaught of foreign operatives

19:44.550 --> 19:47.348
from tearing this town apart
looking for that book.

19:48.253 --> 19:53.088
I suggest you
and your team do the same thing.

20:02.668 --> 20:04.932
This place looks
more like a museum than a house.

20:05.104 --> 20:06.901
How can you even relax
in a place like this?

20:07.072 --> 20:08.767
What, you don't like antiques?

20:08.941 --> 20:11.375
"Antique" is just a fancy word
for "second-hand goods."

20:11.543 --> 20:13.503
Why would I want something
that somebody else had?

20:13.645 --> 20:15.085
We're not talking
about a toothbrush.

20:15.247 --> 20:18.683
I mean, look around, you don't find
craftsmanship like this anymore.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.818
Some of this stuff
is probably worth a fortune.

20:21.019 --> 20:22.111
Reason number two:

20:22.287 --> 20:24.585
Why would I want a coffee table
I can't put my boots on

20:24.756 --> 20:26.656
or have to worry
about my beer leaving a ring?

20:26.892 --> 20:28.519
You are a classy chick.

20:28.760 --> 20:29.784
I'm classy.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.023
You're more sassy than classy.

20:33.198 --> 20:36.190
Oh, and those yoga bunnies you
were perving on before, they're classy?

20:36.768 --> 20:40.135
"It's really hard when I'm on the road
all the time touring with the band."

20:41.607 --> 20:43.768
Like I said, classy.

20:45.043 --> 20:48.171
Whoa. Check this out.

20:48.347 --> 20:50.212
It's an application for a clinical trial

20:50.415 --> 20:53.213
at UCLA Jonsson's
Comprehensive Cancer Center.

20:53.452 --> 20:54.544
Renner had cancer?

20:55.521 --> 20:57.182
I don't know. If he did, it wasn't good.

20:57.356 --> 21:00.348
This trial involves placing
experimental chemotherapy wafers

21:00.559 --> 21:04.620
into the brain after the removal
of a metastatic tumor.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.988
Brain cancer.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.406
That might explain why the Germans
came after Renner now.

21:09.535 --> 21:12.629
If they learned he was dying, they were
afraid he was gonna unload the book.

21:12.838 --> 21:15.671
Well, selling it would provide
Sander Lee with a pretty nice nest egg.

21:15.874 --> 21:18.069
Well, he's already
got a nice little nest egg here

21:18.243 --> 21:19.723
but maybe Renner
was getting rid of it

21:19.878 --> 21:21.958
so no one would come
after Sander Lee looking for it.

21:22.014 --> 21:23.743
Well, if so, he waited too long.

21:26.051 --> 21:27.313
Hetty said the dogs were gone.

21:27.519 --> 21:28.543
Dogs don't wear shoes.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.332
Well, that's not necessarily true.
You ever seen those little dog booties?

21:31.356 --> 21:32.880
Got little bells on them.

21:33.058 --> 21:34.150
Federal agents.

21:34.326 --> 21:35.657
- L.A.P.D.
- NSA.

21:35.861 --> 21:37.453
- NCIS.
- M-O-U-S-E.

21:47.172 --> 21:49.333
- What are you doing here?
- This is our case.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.406
Sebastian Renner
was a foreign national

21:51.577 --> 21:54.546
with information considered a threat
to the United States of America.

21:54.713 --> 21:56.772
- Still our case.
- We don't have to be adversaries.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.677
After all, we're on the same side.

21:59.384 --> 22:01.284
Perhaps we could work together.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.864
Have you found anything
that might be...?

22:02.888 --> 22:04.116
- Unh!
- Whoa!

22:10.929 --> 22:12.055
What are you doing?

22:12.231 --> 22:14.131
You heard the guy.
We're on the same side.

22:14.299 --> 22:16.426
- I'm pretty sure he's not in NSA.
- Pretty sure?

22:16.635 --> 22:18.933
You teed off on him
like you were kicking a field goal.

22:19.104 --> 22:20.901
I've got a hunch
they're foreign operatives.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.131
A hunch?

22:22.374 --> 22:25.935
You don't kick a guy
in his junk on a hunch.

22:26.111 --> 22:28.944
Jeez, sometimes
I don't even know you.

22:30.048 --> 22:31.072
Who does that?

22:31.950 --> 22:37.013
This place smells
like fish and gasoline.

22:37.222 --> 22:41.625
I can hear the water underneath me.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.895
Where the hell am I? A boathouse?

22:45.097 --> 22:46.291
Something like that.

22:46.531 --> 22:47.555
Budget cuts?

22:47.733 --> 22:51.965
Or are you planning
on chopping me up into chum?

22:52.170 --> 22:55.662
We'd just like to ask you
a few questions, Mr. Cole.

22:55.907 --> 22:57.568
You were an East German agent?

22:58.944 --> 23:00.969
Was I?

23:01.179 --> 23:04.979
I don't remember things. Heh.

23:05.617 --> 23:07.346
Tell us what you do remember.

23:08.287 --> 23:11.779
I remember...

23:12.624 --> 23:14.819
San Francisco.

23:15.360 --> 23:20.957
November 22nd, 1989.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.328
It smelled just like this.

23:23.568 --> 23:27.561
But it was cold and drizzly.

23:27.873 --> 23:33.607
Last day I had eyesight
and the sun wasn't even shining.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.359
Is that when you had the stroke?

23:35.447 --> 23:40.544
My stroke was caused
by blood loss from two bullet holes.

23:40.719 --> 23:43.779
Compliments
of an American operative.

23:43.989 --> 23:45.650
You were fortunate to survive.

23:47.125 --> 23:48.649
Was I?

23:51.196 --> 23:53.027
Why don't you tell us
about Sebastian Renner?

23:53.198 --> 23:55.632
He was an antiques dealer.

23:55.801 --> 23:58.895
- Was?
- He's dead, isn't he?

23:59.538 --> 24:01.836
Supposedly, he has a book of yours.

24:02.040 --> 24:05.339
I don't remember any book, sorry.

24:05.544 --> 24:07.876
You were told Sebastian Renner died
this morning.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.206
Usually, Alzheimer's patients
have more of a problem

24:10.382 --> 24:11.406
with short-term memory.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.743
I am not a doctor.

24:13.985 --> 24:15.543
No.

24:15.821 --> 24:17.345
You were a spy.

24:17.556 --> 24:20.582
I was a lot of things.

24:20.759 --> 24:24.490
Now I am just this.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.894
You want my help?

24:28.066 --> 24:29.192
So be it.

24:29.368 --> 24:31.393
We make a trade.

24:32.037 --> 24:35.131
I tell you what you need to know

24:35.340 --> 24:40.710
and in exchange,
Sylvia finishes what she started.

24:41.546 --> 24:42.740
Sylvia?

24:44.416 --> 24:49.080
Vicious pixie owes me that much.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.564
Sylvia is one of Hetty's aliases.

25:05.937 --> 25:08.883
Seems like there's a lot of old-school
cloak-and-dagger stuff going on here

25:08.907 --> 25:09.999
we're not being told about.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.754
How'd you make out? Did you take
anything new from Renner's?

25:13.778 --> 25:16.906
Yes, these two guys.

25:18.416 --> 25:20.213
These jokers waltzed in
while we were there,

25:20.385 --> 25:23.548
tried to pass themselves off
as NSA agents, but they're DGSE.

25:23.722 --> 25:25.587
French Intelligence Agency.

25:25.824 --> 25:27.883
- How'd you know they were bogus?
- Their accents.

25:28.093 --> 25:29.560
They didn't have accents.

25:29.794 --> 25:32.558
Do you know the difference between
French open syllabic organization

25:32.731 --> 25:34.699
and English trochaic speech
patterning, Deeks?

25:36.101 --> 25:37.500
That old chestnut?

25:37.702 --> 25:38.896
Hetty was right.

25:39.104 --> 25:40.731
They're coming out
of the woodwork.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.032
Where are they now?

25:42.207 --> 25:44.903
Had my L.A.P.D. Buddies
lock them up for a few hours.

25:45.110 --> 25:47.738
Give them a taste of the real L.A.
That's not in the star tours.

25:47.913 --> 25:50.711
- They have diplomatic immunity.
- That's why we put them in county.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.602
They're gonna be lucky if they get
to make a phone call by Christmas.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.852
- Just don't let Kensi interrogate them.
- Why is that?

25:58.023 --> 26:00.663
Because the guy on the right, she
kicked him in the nom des plumes.

26:01.326 --> 26:03.692
- No.
- Guy didn't even have his weapon out.

26:03.862 --> 26:05.227
- Really?
- I...

26:05.397 --> 26:07.024
Mm-hm. Right in the cul-de-sac.

26:07.198 --> 26:08.918
Kicked him so hard
it gave me a stomachache.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.960
So what? It would have been better
if I pistol-whipped him across the face?

26:12.037 --> 26:13.595
Yes.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.706
What is it with you guys and your...?

26:15.874 --> 26:18.843
It... Really, it's not...

26:19.844 --> 26:20.970
It's not all that.

26:21.146 --> 26:22.443
Trust me.

26:23.782 --> 26:25.750
Did you guys manage
to get anything out of Cole?

26:25.917 --> 26:27.407
Not so much.

26:27.586 --> 26:28.610
He's playing us.

26:30.555 --> 26:33.217
- He may not be the only one.
- What do you mean?

26:35.060 --> 26:36.755
- Yo.
- Eric, I need to talk to Hetty.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.088
She left again.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.731
- How long ago?
- Uh, about an hour ago.

26:40.899 --> 26:42.491
- Did she say where she was going?
- No.

26:42.667 --> 26:44.760
When I asked, she stared me down
like a mongoose.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.681
Bugger.

27:40.925 --> 27:43.018
Don't tell me you wanted
your chair reupholstered.

27:43.194 --> 27:45.560
That was very foolish of you,
Mr. Callen.

27:45.730 --> 27:49.291
You came dangerously close
to having your head blown off.

27:49.934 --> 27:54.234
You're lucky I caught a whiff
of your partner's baby fresh scent.

27:54.472 --> 27:55.996
You and I need to talk.

27:56.207 --> 27:58.072
Shall we start with Branston Cole?

27:58.243 --> 28:01.542
Not unless
he told you something useful.

28:01.713 --> 28:04.648
Well, it was as much
what he didn't tell me.

28:09.587 --> 28:11.316
It was you.

28:12.590 --> 28:13.716
I'm sorry?

28:13.958 --> 28:15.016
You shot him.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.394
It was your wounds
that led to his stroke,

28:17.595 --> 28:19.893
which also suggests
it was you that kept him from dying.

28:20.065 --> 28:22.329
That is quite a theory, Mr. Callen.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.196
You put him into an assisted
living facility as your husband

28:25.370 --> 28:27.850
under a new name so you could
keep working him for information.

28:27.972 --> 28:30.907
Only it's difficult sometimes
to tell when it's his Alzheimer's

28:31.076 --> 28:33.408
and when he's just playing you.

28:34.245 --> 28:36.236
Tell me if I'm wrong.

28:40.685 --> 28:43.552
He's a stubborn old bastard.

28:44.089 --> 28:46.250
But I'm patient.

28:46.491 --> 28:49.927
Occasionally,
he trips up and I get him.

28:51.996 --> 28:55.591
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say that you two enjoy the game.

28:56.101 --> 28:57.625
Maybe even each other's company.

28:57.869 --> 29:01.396
Now you're straying
into fantasy, Mr. Callen.

29:01.573 --> 29:05.065
Cole is an asset from the past,
nothing more.

29:05.276 --> 29:09.007
You read to him.
Every week for years.

29:09.214 --> 29:10.408
It's a cover.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.550
And it's wearing thin.

29:13.318 --> 29:16.287
He's become more
and more withdrawn lately.

29:16.454 --> 29:20.550
As his physical condition worsens,
so does his spirit.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.026
He's willing to cooperate.

29:25.029 --> 29:28.260
If you agree to finish
what you've started.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.333
He's asked you before?

29:38.843 --> 29:41.141
About a year ago.

29:41.646 --> 29:45.275
Taking a life
in the line of duty is one thing.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.179
Hell, I've already shot him.

29:47.685 --> 29:49.414
Twice.

29:49.954 --> 29:52.752
I'm not a murderer, Mr. Callen.

29:54.926 --> 29:57.087
But I may be a hypocrite.

29:58.663 --> 30:03.691
Cole's fate is now in the hands
of someone far greater than I.

30:04.702 --> 30:06.602
I didn't think
there was such a person.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.636
What about
this little black book of secrets?

30:15.847 --> 30:18.577
I don't think he knows
what Renner did with it.

30:18.783 --> 30:21.217
Is it really as valuable
as everyone thinks?

30:22.821 --> 30:25.016
From what I know,

30:26.224 --> 30:29.785
it could permanently damage
international relationships

30:29.961 --> 30:33.328
and jeopardize
our country's political security.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.022
Such as what?

30:35.200 --> 30:38.966
- Sanctioned assassinations?
- Use your imagination.

30:43.808 --> 30:45.799
Are you in the book?

30:47.545 --> 30:50.639
The longer one stays
in this business, Mr. Callen,

30:50.815 --> 30:54.251
the more one's closet resembles
an ossuary.

30:54.419 --> 30:58.913
Mine, I'm afraid, is beginning to look
like the Paris Catacombs.

30:59.657 --> 31:01.648
Speaking of closets,

31:01.826 --> 31:04.260
did you find anything
before you ducked into Sander Lee's?

31:05.330 --> 31:07.525
I found something.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.557
I'm sorry.

31:09.734 --> 31:12.430
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I could just...

31:12.670 --> 31:14.695
No, no, tell us
what you discovered, Nell.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.265
Well, I was looking
through the manuscripts,

31:17.442 --> 31:20.878
thinking that maybe
there's something hidden in them.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.674
It took me a while
to even figure out what they were

31:24.849 --> 31:27.010
because they're written
in boustrophedon.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.947
Back and forth like plowing a field.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.655
Exactly, very old school.

31:31.856 --> 31:33.721
Miss Jones, to the point.

31:33.925 --> 31:35.586
Right. Well, the manuscript's legit.

31:35.760 --> 31:36.784
It's not the book.

31:36.961 --> 31:39.191
It's the bookmark. Eric?

31:40.732 --> 31:42.563
It's sterling silver and very rare.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.463
See, it has
a magnifying glass compartment,

31:44.669 --> 31:46.398
which contains
a miniature dictionary.

31:46.804 --> 31:49.534
It was a very clever novelty item
back in Victorian England.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.403
That's when Eric and I started talking
about Sherlock Holmes

31:52.610 --> 31:54.578
and vintage cloak-and-dagger stuff.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.680
Anyway,
it was Eric who found it.

31:57.548 --> 31:59.311
It was the punctuation
that was the tip-off.

31:59.484 --> 32:00.815
There's just too much of it.

32:00.985 --> 32:03.977
That's when our conversation started
me thinking about Cold War spy craft,

32:04.188 --> 32:05.212
and then it hit me.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.254
- Microdots.
- Exactly.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.222
Renner was using
old-school techniques

32:09.394 --> 32:10.793
to hide his assets in plain sight.

32:10.962 --> 32:12.725
It was easily overlooked
by everyone.

32:12.931 --> 32:16.128
I managed to enlarge
one of the microdots.

32:17.001 --> 32:18.559
So we found it?

32:18.770 --> 32:21.898
Yes and no. I'm still analyzing this,
but for the most part,

32:22.073 --> 32:24.735
it just seems like a lot
of outdated Cold War information.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.741
The value of which
is suspect, at best.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.278
But it could mean
that the information we're looking for

32:30.448 --> 32:32.075
is hidden in a similar manner.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.050
You see how many books
were in Renner's place?

32:34.919 --> 32:37.319
It could take years
to look through them all for microdots.

32:37.488 --> 32:39.513
- It's like picking flies...
- Yes, Mr. Hanna,

32:39.724 --> 32:42.215
it would be labor intensive,
to say the very least.

32:42.860 --> 32:44.452
But we have to do something.

32:44.629 --> 32:49.032
Washington is having a conniption fit
over the number of foreign operatives

32:49.233 --> 32:51.030
who have descended on our city.

32:51.269 --> 32:54.636
What if we put word out that Cole's
book had been found and it's for sale?

32:55.273 --> 32:57.264
We could use
some of what we found as proof

32:57.442 --> 33:00.377
to smoke out the foreign operatives
that have infiltrated the city.

33:00.611 --> 33:03.739
Sounds like a plan. Let's do it.

33:08.619 --> 33:10.678
I put it out to the Koreans
and the Armenians

33:10.855 --> 33:11.981
that the book is for sale.

33:12.190 --> 33:13.350
Speak to your buddy, Arkady?

33:13.524 --> 33:15.788
He might be helpful
in spreading the word.

33:17.261 --> 33:18.489
What is it?

33:19.564 --> 33:21.998
- It's Hetty.
- What about her?

33:22.166 --> 33:23.656
Something's not right.

33:23.868 --> 33:24.960
I'll be right back.

33:26.504 --> 33:27.528
What's going on?

33:27.772 --> 33:28.864
I'm not sure.

33:29.474 --> 33:30.532
Nell, have you seen Hetty?

33:30.708 --> 33:32.141
She was in her office.

33:34.345 --> 33:36.210
- Eric?
- Yeah.

33:36.381 --> 33:38.975
- Hetty up there?
- Yes, she was...

33:39.150 --> 33:40.412
I'm sorry, she's like a ninja.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.845
- Mattias.
- Herta.

34:08.246 --> 34:10.237
I had hope you'd find my note.

34:10.415 --> 34:11.438
You look well.

34:11.681 --> 34:13.114
Well enough.

34:13.317 --> 34:15.045
- As do you.
- Too much sun.

34:15.253 --> 34:16.618
Too much wine. Too much food.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.619
But I didn't expect
either one of us to live this long,

34:20.824 --> 34:21.849
so who cares?

34:23.895 --> 34:25.328
If you hand over your weapons,

34:25.496 --> 34:28.329
it would spare us both the vulgarity
of having me search you.

34:33.938 --> 34:35.871
That's it these days.

34:36.040 --> 34:39.339
And even then,
it's mostly for the common street thug.

34:39.543 --> 34:41.068
Ha, ha. Please, sit.

34:41.279 --> 34:42.473
Thank you.

34:48.252 --> 34:50.277
It's a shame, isn't it?

34:50.455 --> 34:52.889
So much crime and corruption.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.949
Whatever happened
to honor among thieves, huh?

34:56.159 --> 34:58.720
Or respect for one's elders.

34:58.896 --> 35:00.625
Let alone one's enemies.

35:00.865 --> 35:02.765
Chivalry.

35:02.967 --> 35:05.060
Indeed.

35:07.238 --> 35:09.468
Do you ever come here?

35:09.907 --> 35:11.306
Occasionally.

35:11.509 --> 35:13.409
It reminds me
of the first time we met.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.272
Vienna.

35:15.513 --> 35:17.981
The Volksoper Wien.

35:18.182 --> 35:21.948
I missed the second act
of Die Landstreicher because of you.

35:22.153 --> 35:24.644
I wish you'd stayed.

35:25.423 --> 35:29.120
Of course, you still would have missed
the second act.

35:34.332 --> 35:36.766
I don't have the book, Mattias.

35:38.769 --> 35:40.532
I don't even care anymore.

35:40.705 --> 35:45.199
But to be honest, I'm beginning to think
it's nothing more than a legend.

35:45.443 --> 35:47.308
No, I don't want the book.

35:48.179 --> 35:50.010
I want Kohl.

35:50.214 --> 35:51.306
He's dead.

35:52.717 --> 35:54.014
- Herta.
- I shot him myself.

35:54.218 --> 35:55.480
That much is true,

35:55.653 --> 35:56.813
but our agents confirmed

35:56.988 --> 35:59.548
that he survived his run-in
with the Gartenzwerg.

36:00.858 --> 36:04.157
With you, Kohl was most fortunate.

36:04.328 --> 36:06.922
I know only too well that most aren't.

36:07.131 --> 36:08.928
Present company excepted.

36:10.434 --> 36:13.130
You must know then
that I won't tell you anything.

36:13.337 --> 36:16.238
I would never insult you
by suggesting you would.

36:16.440 --> 36:19.375
I'm confident, however, that you are
worth far more to your people

36:19.544 --> 36:21.739
than a crippled old blind man.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.307
Which is why I'm certain

36:24.482 --> 36:28.543
they will be willing to trade him
for you.

36:44.468 --> 36:47.528
I apologize
for the distastefulness of it all,

36:47.705 --> 36:49.730
but we should get going.

36:51.976 --> 36:53.705
I'm not going anywhere.

36:53.911 --> 36:58.109
You're just going to have
to shoot me right here.

36:58.349 --> 37:01.682
Herta, I could kiss you right now

37:01.886 --> 37:04.411
if I wasn't afraid you would gouge out
both of my eyes

37:04.589 --> 37:07.683
and bite through my windpipe
if I got close enough.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.360
The fact
that you are so damn defiant,

37:10.561 --> 37:13.394
especially knowing
what I'm capable of...

37:13.564 --> 37:16.431
You truly
are the last of a dying breed.

37:17.635 --> 37:19.296
We both are, Mattias.

37:19.537 --> 37:21.903
We are, aren't we?

37:22.073 --> 37:25.941
It's not just my Kodachrome nostalgia
for a simpler time.

37:27.111 --> 37:29.875
The world has changed

37:30.448 --> 37:32.245
and our business has changed.

37:33.451 --> 37:36.943
And I, for one,
have seen enough bloodshed

37:37.121 --> 37:39.783
in the name of king and country.

37:40.024 --> 37:42.083
Well, let me appeal to you

37:42.260 --> 37:45.957
as one Cold War survivor
to another.

37:46.564 --> 37:48.122
What is Kohl to you?

37:48.566 --> 37:51.933
No one cares about a crippled,
blind traitor.

37:54.639 --> 37:58.097
Surely you haven't developed feelings
for the old man.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.767
You know, he is the one who
gave you the nickname Gartenzwerg.

38:03.648 --> 38:06.310
Sticks and stones.

38:06.550 --> 38:10.782
Unfortunately,
we're now talking guns and knives.

38:10.988 --> 38:15.152
You're just as valuable to me dead,
my dear.

38:15.359 --> 38:17.827
I send your people an ear,
maybe a finger.

38:17.995 --> 38:20.293
They'll hand over Kohl
before your corpse is cold.

38:20.498 --> 38:22.432
Why now?

38:22.633 --> 38:27.297
Who cares about the
incoherent babblings of an old man?

38:27.505 --> 38:31.134
Some wounds last a lifetime.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.776
Treason is one of them.

38:34.612 --> 38:36.273
I'm sorry, Herta.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.210
I find it hard to even do this myself.

38:39.383 --> 38:42.944
But in the end, we all die alone.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.814
One more step and she's dead.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.893
Don't listen to him.
I already told him to shoot me.

38:51.095 --> 38:52.323
And I'm still here.

38:57.201 --> 38:58.361
- Clear.
- Clear.

38:58.602 --> 39:00.297
Clear.

39:08.913 --> 39:12.849
I guess that's the difference
between us, Mattias.

39:14.518 --> 39:19.546
Despite my best efforts
to keep these ones at arm's length,

39:19.724 --> 39:21.692
I'm not in this alone.

39:24.729 --> 39:26.822
Gesundheit.

39:26.997 --> 39:28.021
Nicely played.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.368
The FBI and the real NSA
have been brought up

39:35.539 --> 39:37.234
to speed, along
with the other agencies.

39:37.408 --> 39:40.208
Hopefully, we'll be able to round up
the rest of the foreign operatives

39:40.344 --> 39:41.402
still lurking around town.

39:41.645 --> 39:43.738
What's going to happen to Mattias?

39:43.948 --> 39:45.745
If he's lucky,
he'll be sent back to Germany

39:45.916 --> 39:47.850
in some face-saving spy trade.

39:48.052 --> 39:50.077
Along
with Kensi's French boyfriends.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.522
What about this missing book?

39:52.690 --> 39:54.590
If it's hidden
among Renner's manuscripts

39:54.759 --> 39:56.954
or in his library,
it will take a while to find it.

39:57.928 --> 40:02.228
Nevertheless, it was a job well done.

40:02.400 --> 40:07.463
National security is a marathon,
not a sprint.

40:07.671 --> 40:12.699
I suggest you all get some rest.
The game begins anew tomorrow.

40:17.548 --> 40:21.382
Well, I don't know about you guys,
but I could use a drink.

40:21.585 --> 40:23.678
You'd be better off
getting a good night's sleep.

40:23.888 --> 40:26.482
Don't let alcohol become your chosen
form of stress management.

40:26.724 --> 40:28.817
I'm not stressed, man,
but I'm buying.

40:29.059 --> 40:30.492
- Then I'm in.
- Me too.

40:30.661 --> 40:32.253
Nell, that means
you gotta come too.

40:32.463 --> 40:34.124
I can't be the only woman
in this group.

40:34.999 --> 40:37.433
Really? Okay.

40:37.635 --> 40:39.933
Looks like
you're the designated driver, G.

40:41.005 --> 40:42.063
Nice.

40:42.239 --> 40:44.503
If that's the case,
I'm gonna check with Hetty

40:44.708 --> 40:46.908
and see if she wants
to make this the Magnificent Seven.

40:49.413 --> 40:51.847
- I call shotgun.
- Fine. You can have shotgun.

40:54.251 --> 40:57.243
Oh, come on.

40:57.421 --> 40:59.252
You see the look on your face?

40:59.423 --> 41:01.357
I'm all right, Mr. Callen.

41:01.525 --> 41:03.083
Thank you for not asking.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.730
Just wanted to see if you wanna
join us for a drink. I'm driving.

41:07.231 --> 41:11.861
A more generous, inviting offer
I can't imagine.

41:12.036 --> 41:13.663
But I have plans.

41:13.871 --> 41:15.600
Hetty, you're kidding me.

41:16.040 --> 41:19.032
You almost getting killed today,
that doesn't merit a celebratory cocktail

41:19.243 --> 41:20.267
with your rescuers?

41:20.478 --> 41:22.742
I have a previous commitment.

41:22.947 --> 41:26.883
Forgive me if I'm hesitant
to let you out of my sight.

41:29.253 --> 41:33.883
If you must know,
I'm going to see Branston Cole.

41:34.124 --> 41:37.252
Which means what, exactly?

41:37.995 --> 41:39.792
I'm not certain myself.

41:40.264 --> 41:43.290
But it's something
I have to do alone this time,

41:43.467 --> 41:47.460
and I'm confident
that you'll respect my wishes to do so.

41:49.874 --> 41:52.900
Good night, Mr. Callen.
