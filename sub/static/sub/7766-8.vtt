WEBVTT

00:13.999 --> 00:14.999
- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:14.999 --> 00:15.999
I'm a bit cross with you.

00:15.999 --> 00:17.000
Don't be mean to her.

00:17.999 --> 00:18.999
The girls are trying
to push Lala out

00:18.999 --> 00:19.999
because they've got it here,

00:19.999 --> 00:21.999
and they don't want
any competition.

00:21.999 --> 00:25.999
- Who were you with that
did whatever you like?

00:25.999 --> 00:27.999
- Lauren.

00:27.999 --> 00:30.999
- I have not spoken with James
at all

00:30.999 --> 00:32.999
since I found out that
he f***ed my coworker.

00:32.999 --> 00:33.999
- What's this deal?

00:33.999 --> 00:34.999
Kristen calls me up,

00:34.999 --> 00:36.999
and she says that
you spit on her?

00:36.999 --> 00:37.999
- I did not spit on
any f***ing girl,

00:37.999 --> 00:38.999
so don't f***ing
tell me that I have.

00:38.999 --> 00:39.999
- Okay, stop it right now.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.999
For God's sake,
just pull yourself together,

00:41.999 --> 00:42.999
and nothing that you're saying

00:42.999 --> 00:44.999
is more important than
those kids out there.

00:44.999 --> 00:45.999
- This was heaven.

00:45.999 --> 00:46.999
- So sounds to me like
this is shaping up to be

00:46.999 --> 00:48.999
a really good birthday.

00:48.999 --> 00:49.999
Getting excited?

00:49.999 --> 00:50.999
- I just organized something.

00:50.999 --> 00:51.999
All of the guys
are going to Vegas.

00:51.999 --> 00:54.999
- I'll be here working.
You guys go have fun.

00:54.999 --> 00:57.999
It's nice to know that
the day after my birthday

00:57.999 --> 00:58.999
I'm not invited to a big trip.

00:58.999 --> 01:00.999
- Do you want me
to not go?

01:00.999 --> 01:01.999
- Kind of.

01:06.999 --> 01:10.999
- ♪ You know

- How was everything?

01:39.999 --> 01:41.999
Was it good?
- Cleaned my plate.

01:41.999 --> 01:44.999
- Thank you to all of you.

01:44.999 --> 01:47.999
All right, darlings,
bye-bye, bye-bye.

01:47.999 --> 01:48.999
- What is that?

01:48.999 --> 01:49.999
- Um, Lisa needs me
to take this

01:49.999 --> 01:51.999
to the mailbox or the
post office for her.

01:51.999 --> 01:53.999
I don't know, she goes,
"Can you seal this and take it?

01:53.999 --> 01:55.999
I can't anymore.
I'm exhausted."

01:55.999 --> 01:56.999
- Okay.
I was like, "Wait"--

01:56.999 --> 01:58.999
- Just, like,
so you guys know,

01:58.999 --> 02:01.999
Peter thinks that he's going
to organize a guys' trip

02:01.999 --> 02:05.999
to Vegas the day
after my f***ing birthday.

02:07.999 --> 02:08.999
- Okay, that's
not happening.

02:08.999 --> 02:09.999
- I'm sorry,
but I like to have fun.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.999
- Yeah, me too.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.999
In that case, so it's like,
"You're going to Vegas?

02:13.999 --> 02:14.999
Cool.
When do we leave?"

02:14.999 --> 02:15.999
There's no boys' trips.
- Yeah, no.

02:15.999 --> 02:19.999
- Tom, he ruined the Vegas
boys' trip last year.

02:19.999 --> 02:21.999
- All right, you know
the whole Vegas thing?

02:21.999 --> 02:24.999
I actually did, like,
make out with that girl.

02:24.999 --> 02:26.999
- Yeah, that's not happening.

02:26.999 --> 02:27.999
- I'm sorry,
he lost the privilege.

02:27.999 --> 02:29.999
- No one's going anywhere
the day after my birthday.

02:29.999 --> 02:30.999
- No, I wouldn't.

02:30.999 --> 02:31.999
- Can we make a pact
this is not happening?

02:31.999 --> 02:32.999
- We're all in
relationships now.

02:32.999 --> 02:34.999
Yeah, that's not
happening.

02:34.999 --> 02:36.999
- This whole trip reeks
of Peter and Jax,

02:36.999 --> 02:40.999
because I think maybe Jax
and Peter are kind of

02:40.999 --> 02:43.000
freaking out that they're
finally with somebody

02:43.000 --> 02:45.999
that they are happy with.

02:45.999 --> 02:46.999
It's so dumb.

02:46.999 --> 02:47.999
- I'm gonna go back
out there and check

02:47.999 --> 02:50.999
and make sure the table's
all clean and set, but yeah--

02:50.999 --> 02:51.999
- Figured you guys
would want to know.

02:58.999 --> 02:59.999
- Yes?

02:59.999 --> 03:00.999
- Hey, how's it going?
- What do you two want?

03:00.999 --> 03:01.999
I know you want something.

03:01.999 --> 03:02.999
- Peter has something
to ask you.

03:04.999 --> 03:05.999
- So I celebrated
my birthday here.

03:05.999 --> 03:08.999
So I was wondering
if it'd be all right

03:08.999 --> 03:10.999
if I take some time off?

03:10.999 --> 03:13.999
- Where?
- A little place called Vegas.

03:13.999 --> 03:14.999
- Oh, for God's sake.

03:14.999 --> 03:16.999
The trouble you guys
get into in Vegas,

03:16.999 --> 03:18.999
haven't you learned
your lesson by now?

03:18.999 --> 03:22.999
You impregnated somebody
in Vegas, if you remember.

03:22.999 --> 03:24.999
You seem to have forgotten that.
- I do remember that.

03:24.999 --> 03:26.999
I did go to Vegas and have
relations with somebody else.

03:31.999 --> 03:32.999
Thank you for reminding me.

03:32.999 --> 03:34.999
- Well, that's okay,
I'm just telling you.

03:34.999 --> 03:35.999
I'm giving you
the heads up.

03:35.999 --> 03:36.999
Who's going?

03:36.999 --> 03:37.999
- Me, Tom, Jax, Tom,

03:37.999 --> 03:38.999
and maybe Shay.

03:38.999 --> 03:39.999
- Oh, no, no.

03:39.999 --> 03:40.999
You do not take Shay.

03:40.999 --> 03:42.999
He needs to stay
in a relationship,

03:42.999 --> 03:43.999
and going to Vegas is
probably not gonna help.

03:43.999 --> 03:45.999
- What, because
you're married,

03:45.999 --> 03:46.999
that doesn't mean you've
got to be a prisoner.

03:46.999 --> 03:47.999
- Oh, it does;
it means you're dead,

03:47.999 --> 03:48.999
and it does mean
you're a prisoner.

03:48.999 --> 03:50.999
So you don't need to try.
- No, no.

03:50.999 --> 03:51.999
I'm--then I'm never
getting married.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
- Oh, oh, really?
Oh, what a shock.

03:53.999 --> 03:54.999
Why would Jax and Peter,

03:54.999 --> 03:58.999
that are in supposedly
"serious relationships,"

03:58.999 --> 04:01.999
want to go and test
themselves in Sin City?

04:01.999 --> 04:03.999
I mean, that's like wolves
going to a henhouse.

04:03.999 --> 04:05.999
I don't care if you go
as long as you make sure

04:05.999 --> 04:06.999
all your shifts
are covered,

04:06.999 --> 04:08.999
but I need you back
by Saturday night.

04:08.999 --> 04:09.999
- Deal.
- Don't get in trouble.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.999
- Whoo!

04:11.999 --> 04:12.999
- Vegas.
- Vegas.

04:16.999 --> 04:19.999
- I had Anya put a "reserved"
sign on the bar table.

04:19.999 --> 04:21.999
- Hi.
- What's up?

04:21.999 --> 04:23.999
- What's up? How are you?
- I'm good.

04:23.999 --> 04:25.999
- It's good to see you.
- Thank you.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.999
- I just wanted to say
hi, and, you know--

04:28.999 --> 04:29.999
- Yeah.

04:29.999 --> 04:31.999
- It's a little more awkward
than I thought it was gonna be.

04:31.999 --> 04:33.999
So I spoke to Faith
just now, actually.

04:33.999 --> 04:36.999
She told me she's going to
Ariana's birthday party.

04:36.999 --> 04:37.999
Clearly, I'm not invited.

04:37.999 --> 04:38.999
- She's having a birthday party?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.999
- Yeah, did you not
get an invite yet?

04:40.999 --> 04:42.999
- I--no.

04:42.999 --> 04:44.999
- I mean, you know,
I'm just, like,

04:44.999 --> 04:45.999
not even that bothered, really.

04:45.999 --> 04:46.999
I mean, it's just
gonna be complete

04:46.999 --> 04:48.999
Silver Lake bullsh** hipster.

04:48.999 --> 04:49.999
Like, it's like
balloon animals,

04:49.999 --> 04:51.999
face paint,
a little bouncy room.

04:51.999 --> 04:54.999
- I don't want to be an outcast.

04:54.999 --> 04:55.999
I should be a basic bitch,

04:55.999 --> 04:58.999
and then I could get invited to

04:58.999 --> 05:01.999
all the little unicorn parties.

05:01.999 --> 05:04.999
That's really weird to me
because Ariana and I,

05:04.999 --> 05:05.999
I thought that we were cool.

05:05.999 --> 05:07.999
- Friends, yeah.

05:07.999 --> 05:08.999
- I mean, Katie,
on the other hand,

05:08.999 --> 05:10.999
I f***ing don't like at all.

05:10.999 --> 05:11.999
- She doesn't really
like you either.

05:11.999 --> 05:13.999
- Oh, break my heart.

05:13.999 --> 05:14.999
- I'm just saying, I mean,

05:14.999 --> 05:16.999
I don't know what
she's saying to you.

05:16.999 --> 05:17.999
- Are they the type of girls
where it would be, like,

05:17.999 --> 05:20.999
if Ariana invited Katie
and Katie was like,

05:20.999 --> 05:22.999
"I don't like Lala,"
Ariana wouldn't invite me?

05:22.999 --> 05:24.000
- Yes, they're
those type of girls.

05:24.999 --> 05:25.999
100%.
- Really?

05:25.999 --> 05:27.999
- Hey, but if we both got
nothing to do, I mean,

05:27.999 --> 05:29.999
we can go out for a drink,
maybe or something.

05:29.999 --> 05:30.999
- Oh, can we?
- Yeah, why not?

05:30.999 --> 05:32.999
- You're paying.
- All right.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.999
- For all 17 of my cocktails.

05:34.999 --> 05:36.999
You got a lot of
making up to do.

05:36.999 --> 05:38.999
We'll just leave it at that.

05:42.999 --> 05:44.999
- How many goodie bags
do we need?

05:44.999 --> 05:47.999
I got one, two, three,
four, five, six.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.999
Who's all coming?

05:49.999 --> 05:51.999
- Scheana, Shay,
Katie, Schwartz,

05:51.999 --> 05:55.999
Peter, Sarah,
Jax is bringing Brittany.

05:55.999 --> 05:56.999
Obviously did not invite

05:56.999 --> 05:59.999
Kristen and/or James
'cause that makes--

05:59.999 --> 06:01.000
- Why--Why not Kristen?

06:01.999 --> 06:03.999
- I did not invite...

06:03.999 --> 06:04.999
Lala.

06:04.999 --> 06:06.999
I invited Faith.

06:06.999 --> 06:07.999
- Yeah.

06:09.999 --> 06:11.999
You're obviously not keen
on the whole idea

06:11.999 --> 06:15.999
of--of, uh, the--
the boys' trip, huh?

06:15.999 --> 06:19.999
- Kind of felt like a kick
in the stomach a little bit.

06:19.999 --> 06:22.999
I don't want to guilt-trip
Tom into not going to Vegas.

06:22.999 --> 06:25.999
I just want him to understand
that it is meaningful for me

06:25.999 --> 06:29.999
for him to be here with me
and to just want to be here.

06:29.999 --> 06:30.999
Don't act sad about it

06:30.999 --> 06:32.999
'cause you don't
really care.

06:35.999 --> 06:37.999
- Um, Peter and Jax,

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
from what I understand,
it was first presented to you

06:39.999 --> 06:42.999
as a guys' trip to Vegas,

06:42.999 --> 06:44.999
and I just want to say

06:44.999 --> 06:45.999
it's not a guys' trip
to Vegas.

06:45.999 --> 06:46.999
It is a celebration

06:46.999 --> 06:48.999
of Peter's birthday party,

06:48.999 --> 06:50.999
and it happens to be
in Vegas.

06:50.999 --> 06:52.999
- You know that a boys' trip--

06:52.999 --> 06:54.999
It's something that we agreed
that wasn't gonna happen.

06:54.999 --> 06:55.999
It's not a matter of, like,

06:55.999 --> 06:56.999
"Oh, I feel like
he's going to go

06:56.999 --> 06:57.999
and cheat on me again."

06:57.999 --> 07:00.999
No, it's just we just said
no boys' trips.

07:00.999 --> 07:01.999
- Let me just go.

07:01.999 --> 07:02.999
- No.

07:02.999 --> 07:03.999
I'm sorry, I'm--

07:03.999 --> 07:05.999
like, I'm not gonna
give you my blessing.

07:05.999 --> 07:06.999
- I'm sorry, but, like,

07:06.999 --> 07:08.999
it just pisses me off.

07:08.999 --> 07:10.999
- It doesn't matter
'cause you're not going anyways.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.999
- Yeah.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.999
In Ariana's mind,
I'm not going,

07:16.999 --> 07:20.999
but we've been doing guys' trips
like this for years.

07:20.999 --> 07:21.999
I mean, it's tradition.

07:21.999 --> 07:23.999
- Better times are usually had

07:23.999 --> 07:28.999
when alone involving
takeout and Netflix.

07:28.999 --> 07:30.999
- I'm just gonna put
that much more effort

07:30.999 --> 07:33.999
into making her birthday
the best birthday ever.

07:33.999 --> 07:35.999
I do love it when you smile.

07:35.999 --> 07:38.999
- Could I get some macaroni
with that cheese?

07:38.999 --> 07:39.999
- So that way, she feels great

07:39.999 --> 07:41.999
when she sees me
getting into that car

07:41.999 --> 07:43.999
and leaving with the guys
to go to Vegas.

07:43.999 --> 07:44.999
It's official,
you're gonna have

07:44.999 --> 07:46.999
the best birthday party ever.

08:01.999 --> 08:04.999
- Hide the black tape
in, uh--yeah.

08:04.999 --> 08:06.999
- Okay.

08:06.999 --> 08:08.999
- Roar!
- Yeah.

08:08.999 --> 08:10.999
- Hey!

08:10.999 --> 08:12.999
- My friend Courtney's parents

08:12.999 --> 08:15.999
have been the nicest people ever

08:15.999 --> 08:17.999
to allow me to have this big
birthday party at their house.

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
It's gonna be
the best birthday ever.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.000
- How's it going, man?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.999
- Good.
Freaking hot, dude.

08:22.999 --> 08:24.999
I've been up since,
like, 8:30 this morning.

08:24.999 --> 08:25.999
- Are you ready
for tomorrow?

08:25.999 --> 08:27.999
- You know,
I'm still working on it.

08:27.999 --> 08:28.999
We'll--We'll see.

08:28.999 --> 08:30.999
- We're gonna stop
at this dig yard.

08:30.999 --> 08:31.999
It's like a playpen.
- Yeah?

08:31.999 --> 08:32.999
- But instead of
playing with shovels,

08:33.000 --> 08:34.999
we're gonna be playing
with bulldozers,

08:34.999 --> 08:35.999
and we're gonna be
wearing hard hats.

08:35.999 --> 08:37.999
- Are you serious?
- I'm very serious.

08:37.999 --> 08:38.999
- Whoa.
- You gotta be ready.

08:38.999 --> 08:41.999
- Yeah, I really
have to go on this trip.

08:41.999 --> 08:42.999
I can't miss that.

08:42.999 --> 08:43.999
Just do me a favor.

08:43.999 --> 08:46.999
Just be very discreet
about talking about Vegas

08:46.999 --> 08:48.000
in front of Ariana 'cause she
doesn't want to--we don't want

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
to take any attention
away from her thing today.

08:50.999 --> 08:51.999
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
no, I get it.

08:53.999 --> 08:55.999
- Yeah, that
looks good, Ariana.

08:55.999 --> 08:56.999
- Hey, guys.

08:56.999 --> 08:57.999
- Hey, what's up, man?
- What's up, baby?

08:57.999 --> 08:58.999
- What's up?
- Look at you, dude.

08:58.999 --> 09:00.999
- Sarah, I'm not gonna lie.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.999
I do have a bit of a bone to
pick with your boyfriend.

09:02.999 --> 09:04.999
I feel like Peter,
at this point,

09:04.999 --> 09:06.999
should know better than
to invite my boyfriend

09:06.999 --> 09:07.999
on a boys' trip.
- I know, right?

09:07.999 --> 09:11.000
- Tom and I went through,
like, hell and high water

09:11.999 --> 09:14.999
last year, partly because
of this boys' trip,

09:14.999 --> 09:16.999
and I was, like,

09:16.999 --> 09:18.999
not feeling super secure
in the relationship.

09:18.999 --> 09:20.999
I just feel like it's almost,
like, disrespectful

09:20.999 --> 09:21.999
to, like, the relationship.

09:21.999 --> 09:24.999
- Dude, bulldozers tomorrow.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.999
We're--we're literally going
to go to an adult sand pen.

09:27.999 --> 09:28.999
- Wait, wait, I've always
wanted to do that!

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
Are you serious?
- Yes.

09:30.999 --> 09:31.999
We're gonna be wearing hard hats
and everything.

09:31.999 --> 09:32.999
- I saw that on YouTube.

09:32.999 --> 09:34.999
My God, f*** yeah!

09:34.999 --> 09:35.999
- It's gonna be great.
- This is a man's trip.

09:35.999 --> 09:37.999
It's not a guys' trip.
- It is a man's trip.

09:37.999 --> 09:38.999
- It's a man's trip.
- Is Sandoval going?

09:38.999 --> 09:40.999
'Cause I'm pretty sure
Ariana would lose her mind

09:40.999 --> 09:42.999
if he left right after
her birthday.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.999
Did he, like, even ask you,
or did he bring it up, or?

09:45.999 --> 09:48.999
- No, he has not given me

09:48.999 --> 09:49.999
the impression that
he is going, so--

09:49.999 --> 09:51.999
- Guys' trips are stupid.
- Well, yeah.

09:51.999 --> 09:53.999
- Wow, look at this.

09:53.999 --> 09:54.999
This is crazy.

10:03.999 --> 10:06.999
- Oh, my God!

10:06.999 --> 10:08.999
- I definitely think deep down,
Ariana is, like,

10:08.999 --> 10:10.999
a five-year-old,
little, Harajuku doll.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.999
- Happy birthday magic
for all of you.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.999
- Whoo!

10:16.999 --> 10:17.999
- I don't know many
five-year-olds that

10:17.999 --> 10:20.999
drink tequila and jump
on trampolines, but--

10:22.999 --> 10:23.999
- Happy birthday,
Ariana.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.999
- Yay, happy birthday, Ariana!

10:25.999 --> 10:26.999
- Whoo!
- Happy birthday!

10:26.999 --> 10:29.999
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

10:35.000 --> 10:36.999
- So hey, listen,
about Vegas tomorrow:

10:36.999 --> 10:37.999
you're okay with all that?

10:37.999 --> 10:38.999
- Yeah, go ahead.

10:38.999 --> 10:40.000
- I'll be good, I promise.
- Have fun.

10:40.999 --> 10:41.999
- You know,
our relationship's so new,

10:41.999 --> 10:43.999
that I'm allowed to go
on all these guys' trips.

10:43.999 --> 10:45.999
I'm not sure how long
this is gonna last, though.

10:49.999 --> 10:50.999
- Job well done.
- Dude, I'm just glad

10:50.999 --> 10:52.999
Ariana's happy,
honestly, like--

10:52.999 --> 10:54.999
- I don't mean to bring it up
like this, and no one's around

10:54.999 --> 10:56.999
right now, but how is that
going with you guys right now?

10:56.999 --> 10:57.999
- My approach was terrible.

10:57.999 --> 10:59.999
I had no good reason
to tell her

10:59.999 --> 11:00.999
why I need to
go to Vegas.

11:00.999 --> 11:02.000
I was like--
- There is no good reason.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.999
- This was--This was
my last selling point,

11:03.999 --> 11:04.999
"Because I want to go."

11:04.999 --> 11:06.999
I had nothing, man.

11:06.999 --> 11:07.999
- Here's the thing.

11:07.999 --> 11:08.999
Ariana is f***ing pissed.

11:08.999 --> 11:10.999
- You need a couple
more shots.

11:10.999 --> 11:12.999
- No, no, I should not
get a couple more shots.

11:12.999 --> 11:13.999
I'm gonna talk to Ariana.

11:13.999 --> 11:15.999
- She's on f***ing
cloud nine right now.

11:15.999 --> 11:18.999
- Oh, man, whoo!
- I know.

11:18.999 --> 11:19.999
- This could bring her
down a few notches.

11:21.999 --> 11:23.999
- The prospect of you,
like, not being here--

11:25.999 --> 11:27.999
- I'm not going anywhere.

11:41.999 --> 11:42.999
- Whoo!

♪ Just show it off ♪

12:12.999 --> 12:13.999
- Whoa, sh**.

12:13.999 --> 12:14.999
- Is that too tight?

12:14.999 --> 12:16.999
- Yeah, this is right--

12:16.999 --> 12:18.999
- Basically,
what I'm doing is

12:18.999 --> 12:19.999
reaching back into my childhood

12:19.999 --> 12:21.999
and grabbing all the cool stuff

12:21.999 --> 12:23.999
from the parties
when I was a kid

12:23.999 --> 12:25.999
and injecting them
with performance-enhancing drugs

12:25.999 --> 12:29.999
to make the most
epic adult kids party ever.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.999
- Oh, sh**.

12:32.999 --> 12:33.999
- I got shoes on.

12:33.999 --> 12:36.999
- We have a bounce house
with a slide.

12:36.999 --> 12:38.999
There's the bungee
trampoline sort of thing.

12:38.999 --> 12:40.999
- Oh, your balls really--ooh.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.999
- And there's face painters,
snow cones,

12:43.999 --> 12:46.999
cotton candy, and tequila.

12:48.999 --> 12:51.999
- Hey, where's,
uh, where's Lala?

12:51.999 --> 12:53.999
- Weren't invited.
- Yeah, that was tough.

12:53.999 --> 12:54.999
- I mean, Lala
barely knows Ariana.

12:54.999 --> 12:55.999
- Yeah, that's true.
- So she shouldn't care.

12:55.999 --> 12:58.999
I had a feeling you
might show up with her.

12:58.999 --> 13:00.999
- And I probably would've
if she was invited.

13:00.999 --> 13:02.999
- The first couple weeks
when, like, you and Lala

13:02.999 --> 13:04.999
got hired, like,
I was going through

13:04.999 --> 13:06.999
so much sh** personally.

13:06.999 --> 13:09.999
He's just been drinking,
like, so much lately

13:09.999 --> 13:10.999
and just, like,
self-medicating.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.999
So I apologize.

13:12.999 --> 13:14.999
- Lala likes you a lot, bro,
and it sucks, dude.

13:14.999 --> 13:15.999
- Yeah, and I
really like her.

13:15.999 --> 13:18.999
That's the problem,
is trying to convince

13:18.999 --> 13:19.999
my friends to like her
as much as I do.

13:19.999 --> 13:21.999
I feel really bad that Lala

13:21.999 --> 13:23.999
wasn't invited
to Ariana's party.

13:23.999 --> 13:24.999
I mean, just because
I've warmed up to her,

13:24.999 --> 13:26.999
not everyone else has.

13:26.999 --> 13:27.999
It's Ariana's birthday,

13:27.999 --> 13:30.999
and she's gonna come around
at her own pace.

13:30.999 --> 13:32.999
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:33.999 --> 13:35.999
Mmm.

13:35.999 --> 13:36.999
- Let's go, Pete!

13:36.999 --> 13:38.999
- Whoo!

13:38.999 --> 13:40.999
- I wanted to just take
a second right now while--

13:41.000 --> 13:42.999
before we get really drunk,

13:42.999 --> 13:45.999
and let down the f***ing
defense mechanism

13:45.999 --> 13:47.999
with the nonstop jokes
and everything.

13:47.999 --> 13:49.999
- So you're gonna go to Vegas?

13:54.999 --> 13:56.999
Um...

13:56.999 --> 13:57.999
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

13:57.999 --> 14:00.999
You know,
you won't even miss me.

14:00.999 --> 14:01.999
- I will miss you.

14:01.999 --> 14:04.999
- Man, don't cry, bubby.

14:04.999 --> 14:05.999
Don't cry.
Why are you crying?

14:05.999 --> 14:08.999
Come on, don't cry.

14:08.999 --> 14:10.999
Why are you crying?

14:10.999 --> 14:12.000
- Because sometimes
it still hurts.

14:12.999 --> 14:13.999
- I know.

14:13.999 --> 14:14.999
- I feel like I am in a place

14:14.999 --> 14:17.999
in my relationship
that it's pretty much

14:17.999 --> 14:18.999
the biggest thing in my life,

14:18.999 --> 14:22.999
and I just feel like Tom
is not prioritizing it,

14:22.999 --> 14:23.999
and that's really frustrating.

14:23.999 --> 14:24.999
- Don't cry, bubby.

14:24.999 --> 14:26.999
- It's just I don't
want to be the one

14:26.999 --> 14:27.999
that constantly--

14:27.999 --> 14:29.999
- What?
That constantly what?

14:29.999 --> 14:31.999
Bubby, don't cry.
- Constantly bends.

14:31.999 --> 14:33.999
- No, you're not bending.
I bend sometimes.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.999
- I'm wondering, like,
how much more bending

14:35.999 --> 14:38.999
there's gonna have
to be before I break.

14:38.999 --> 14:39.999
- There's not--very lit--
very minimal bending

14:39.999 --> 14:44.999
after this trip,
if any ever again.

14:46.999 --> 14:48.999
- Three, two, one,
Ariana, love you!

14:48.999 --> 14:50.999
- Have a little, baby.

14:50.999 --> 14:52.999
- I'll have a sip of this one.

14:54.999 --> 14:56.999
- Oh, sh**!

14:57.999 --> 14:59.999
- I got some slo-mo video.

14:59.999 --> 15:00.999
- Hey, lovey.

15:00.999 --> 15:02.000
- Hey.

15:02.999 --> 15:04.999
- The whole Vegas thing?
- Mm-hmm?

15:04.999 --> 15:07.999
- I talked to him,
and he's gonna go,

15:07.999 --> 15:08.999
and, you know,
for me, like,

15:08.999 --> 15:10.999
as much as it doesn't,

15:10.999 --> 15:12.999
like, soothe me or thrill me
that he's gonna go, like,

15:12.999 --> 15:14.999
I'm not the tyrant girlfriend.
I'm not gonna, like--

15:14.999 --> 15:17.999
- My boyfriend is
not going to leave.

15:17.999 --> 15:20.000
Like, I'm not gonna be
in the bed like this sleeping,

15:20.999 --> 15:21.999
"Oh, my God, my birthday
was just so amazing."

15:21.999 --> 15:23.999
- Well, why don't you just,
like, stay here and all of us.

15:23.999 --> 15:24.999
And we'll just have some--
- Hmm, good morning.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.999
Oh, wait, I'm by myself 'cause

15:26.999 --> 15:27.999
my boyfriend left an hour
ago to go to Vegas, cool."

15:27.999 --> 15:28.999
- No, you're not gonna be
by yourself.

15:28.999 --> 15:29.999
- It's just not the same.

15:29.999 --> 15:30.999
- I don't want to be by myself

15:30.999 --> 15:32.999
either, I don't like
sleeping alone.

15:32.999 --> 15:33.999
- Right, that's why
I'm kind of, like,

15:33.999 --> 15:34.999
this trip would never actually
happen.

15:34.999 --> 15:36.999
- I know, but--

15:36.999 --> 15:39.999
- And just there's a lot
going on with my birthday

15:39.999 --> 15:40.999
that has nothing to do with,

15:40.999 --> 15:42.999
like, this party
or whatever too.

15:42.999 --> 15:45.999
Like...

15:45.999 --> 15:47.999
Like, I don't talk about it
a lot, but, like,

15:47.999 --> 15:50.999
my dad, like, not being here,
like, I'm trying to, like,

15:50.999 --> 15:53.999
make, you know, a really
fun time out of this,

15:53.999 --> 15:54.999
but, like, there's a lot
of sh** on my mind

15:54.999 --> 15:58.999
that has nothing to do
with any of this sh**.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.999
My dad died two years ago.

16:00.999 --> 16:05.999
He was, like,
Northern California hippie,

16:05.999 --> 16:06.999
long-haired guy.

16:06.999 --> 16:07.999
He surfed.

16:07.999 --> 16:09.999
He was just the kind of person

16:09.999 --> 16:12.000
that you thought
was going to live forever.

16:12.999 --> 16:15.999
It's really hard to think
of all of these things

16:15.999 --> 16:17.999
that I thought
he would be here for.

16:17.999 --> 16:18.999
Tom's my best friend.

16:18.999 --> 16:21.999
It's important to me
that he be here

16:21.999 --> 16:23.000
because he's my best friend,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
and he's, like, the most
important person in my life.

16:25.999 --> 16:27.999
- Ariana is a very tough
nut to crack.

16:27.999 --> 16:28.999
She doesn't wear her emotions
on her sleeves.

16:28.999 --> 16:31.999
Ariana's issues
with Tom going to Vegas

16:31.999 --> 16:32.999
aren't really
about her birthday.

16:32.999 --> 16:34.999
They're not even about Tom.

16:34.999 --> 16:35.999
They're about her father

16:35.999 --> 16:38.999
and needing some companionship
right now.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.999
- This is, like,
the one person I have.

16:40.999 --> 16:42.000
- Have you told him that?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.999
'Cause I know--
I know you don't

16:43.999 --> 16:45.999
talk about it often.

16:45.999 --> 16:46.999
- No, but, like,

16:46.999 --> 16:47.999
yesterday it was so,
like, I don't know.

16:47.999 --> 16:48.999
- No, don't cry.
You look so pretty.

16:48.999 --> 16:50.999
You're a pretty--
you look pretty.

16:50.999 --> 16:51.999
You aren't supposed
to cry on your birthday.

16:51.999 --> 16:53.999
I don't want to upset you.
- I know, and I didn't want--

16:53.999 --> 16:55.999
to cry, like, I just,
try to focus on, like--

16:55.999 --> 16:57.999
- Wait, what's going on?
- Saying where it came from.

16:57.999 --> 16:59.999
- Nothing, it's just,
like, I don't know.

16:59.999 --> 17:01.999
I just--I've been thinking
about my dad, like, so much.

17:01.999 --> 17:03.999
- I completely understand where
you're coming from right now,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.999
but I didn't--I didn't
understand because you are

17:06.999 --> 17:08.000
so strong all the time.

17:08.999 --> 17:09.999
Like, you don't really--
- You don't have to be.

17:09.999 --> 17:11.999
- You don't have to be.

17:11.999 --> 17:12.999
- Katie and I cry
a lot, it's okay.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.999
- I cry about dumb sh**.

17:14.999 --> 17:16.999
I watch "The Price is Right"
and I cry, like, I, like,

17:16.999 --> 17:17.999
I'm all about it.

17:17.999 --> 17:18.999
So you know what?

17:18.999 --> 17:20.999
There's more fun to be had.
- Get your butt over there!

17:20.999 --> 17:21.999
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!

17:25.999 --> 17:27.999
- Oh!

17:27.999 --> 17:31.999
- Happy birthday!

17:31.999 --> 17:36.999
- Yes.
I'm just so pleased.

17:36.999 --> 17:37.999
It's the best, man.

17:37.999 --> 17:40.999
I've wanted this level
of epicness

17:40.999 --> 17:44.999
for a birthday party
for 25 years,

17:44.999 --> 17:47.999
and today it's happening.

17:47.999 --> 17:49.999
- Yay!

17:51.999 --> 17:53.999
- Thank you, guys!

17:53.999 --> 17:54.999
- I gotta go.
I have to go.

17:54.999 --> 17:55.999
- Hey, do you want to
talk for a second?

17:55.999 --> 17:57.999
- Yeah, sure.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

17:57.999 --> 17:58.999
- All right.
- I'll see you later.

17:58.999 --> 17:59.999
- All right, all right.

17:59.999 --> 18:01.999
- Did you have fun?

18:01.999 --> 18:03.999
- I had probably, like,

18:03.999 --> 18:06.999
one of, if not, like,
the best birthday...

18:06.999 --> 18:08.999
- Really?
- Possibly ever.

18:08.999 --> 18:09.999
Thanks for helping me
with my party.

18:09.999 --> 18:11.999
- Of course.

18:11.999 --> 18:13.999
- It's been really hard
for me to talk about

18:13.999 --> 18:16.999
why I felt like I needed you
here with me.

18:16.999 --> 18:19.999
f***.

18:23.999 --> 18:26.999
I can't get it out
without being a f***ing pussy

18:26.999 --> 18:27.999
and, like, crying and sh**.

18:27.999 --> 18:28.999
- You're not a pussy.

18:28.999 --> 18:30.999
- I had that thing
stuck in my head

18:30.999 --> 18:33.999
that my dad used to say to me
every year on my birthday.

18:35.999 --> 18:38.999
The Lou Gehrig speech
about how today

18:38.999 --> 18:40.999
I consider myself
the luckiest man

18:40.999 --> 18:42.999
on the face of the Earth
and that whole thing,

18:42.999 --> 18:43.999
and I just, like,
I could hear his voice

18:43.999 --> 18:46.999
saying it all day today.

18:46.999 --> 18:48.999
My birthday's really hard.

18:48.999 --> 18:51.999
My dad used to call me

18:51.999 --> 18:53.999
and say the same thing to me

18:53.999 --> 18:54.999
every year on my birthday.

18:54.999 --> 18:56.999
He said that
the day I was born

18:56.999 --> 19:02.999
was the best day of his life.

19:02.999 --> 19:04.000
When I need somebody there

19:04.000 --> 19:06.999
and I need to talk about
whatever I'm feeling,

19:06.999 --> 19:08.999
whenever like, it's hard
for me to talk about,

19:08.999 --> 19:10.999
but you are the person
that I feel like

19:10.999 --> 19:13.999
I can talk about it with,
and so the prospect of you,

19:13.999 --> 19:16.999
like, not being here
when I've been kind of,

19:16.999 --> 19:19.999
like, having these,
like, things.

19:19.999 --> 19:21.999
- Ariana, all you have to know

19:21.999 --> 19:26.000
is, like, with us, with this,

19:26.999 --> 19:28.999
I'm not going anywhere.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.999
I'm always gonna
be here for you,

19:36.999 --> 19:39.999
but apparently he told me

19:39.999 --> 19:41.999
that we're going
to a construction yard,

19:41.999 --> 19:43.999
and we're taking bulldozers

19:43.999 --> 19:45.999
and, like,
crushing sh** with bulldozers.

19:51.999 --> 19:53.999
- There's no way
for me to continue explaining

19:53.999 --> 19:56.999
how I feel and have it make
sense, so I just, like,

19:56.999 --> 19:58.999
can't even try to explain it.

20:00.999 --> 20:01.999
- Can I please just do this?

20:02.999 --> 20:06.999
- Like, okay, like,
whatever, dude, like--

20:06.999 --> 20:09.999
I only speak one language,
and that's English,

20:09.999 --> 20:11.999
so I don't know
how many other different ways

20:11.999 --> 20:14.999
I can say, "It means a lot to me

20:14.999 --> 20:17.999
that you don't go on this trip
the day after my birthday."

20:17.999 --> 20:19.999
You're never gonna get it.
It's fine.

20:19.999 --> 20:21.999
See you some time later.

20:26.999 --> 20:28.999
- How was the birthday?
Did you all have fun?

20:29.999 --> 20:31.999
- I wasn't invited.

20:40.999 --> 20:41.999
♪ Always on the road... ♪

20:41.999 --> 20:42.999
- We're going to Vegas!

20:42.999 --> 20:44.999
- Peter, thanks for driving,
dude, for real.

20:44.999 --> 20:45.999
- Yeah, of course.
- Appreciate it, man.

20:45.999 --> 20:48.999
- I was back and forth
about this a lot.

20:48.999 --> 20:49.999
- Yeah, for real.
- I--you know, obviously,

20:49.999 --> 20:51.999
I have never given Ariana

20:51.999 --> 20:54.999
any reason not--not--
not to trust me.

20:54.999 --> 20:57.999
- I mean, I don't want
to say Tom has never

20:57.999 --> 20:59.999
given Ariana
a reason not to trust him.

20:59.999 --> 21:02.999
I seem to remember
a little something about Miami,

21:02.999 --> 21:03.999
Miami girl or something
like that.

21:03.999 --> 21:05.999
- We had sex.
- No, we did not.

21:05.999 --> 21:06.999
- We had sex.
- No, we did not.

21:06.999 --> 21:07.999
- Yes, we did.

21:07.999 --> 21:09.999
You're such
a f***ing liar right now.

21:09.999 --> 21:10.999
- Obviously,
she completely trusts me.

21:10.999 --> 21:11.999
- But we don't need to go there.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.999
Like, I don't like about this is

21:13.999 --> 21:15.999
the fact that they're telling
you, "You're not doing that."

21:15.999 --> 21:17.999
- You know, like,
between me and you guys,

21:17.999 --> 21:20.999
like, I see that sometimes
with, like, Scheana and Shay,

21:20.999 --> 21:22.999
and it f***ing
kind of bothers me.

21:22.999 --> 21:23.999
- Yeah.

21:23.999 --> 21:24.999
- She just, like,

21:24.999 --> 21:25.999
she just answers for him
sometimes,

21:25.999 --> 21:27.999
and that's not f***ing cool.

21:27.999 --> 21:29.999
- Oh, my gosh.
- Sorry, yeah.

21:29.999 --> 21:30.999
- Dude, it smells, man.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.999
That's really bad.
- Oh!

21:32.999 --> 21:35.999
That's a--was that you?
- Schwartz, dude.

21:35.999 --> 21:36.999
- Oh, my God.
- Dude.

21:36.999 --> 21:37.999
- It smells like your apartment.
- Shut up.

21:37.999 --> 21:39.999
- It smells like
your apartment.

21:39.999 --> 21:40.999
I can taste it.

21:40.999 --> 21:41.999
- It does not smell
like my apartment.

21:41.999 --> 21:42.999
- It does.
- Dude, gross, man.

21:42.999 --> 21:44.999
- My apartment smells good,
I just bought a Voluspa candle.

21:44.999 --> 21:45.999
It was $30.

21:54.999 --> 21:56.999
- Hey.

21:56.999 --> 21:57.999
- Hi, babe,
how was the birthday?

21:57.999 --> 21:58.999
- It was fun.
- Good.

21:58.999 --> 22:01.999
- Good food,
Schwartz barbecued.

22:01.999 --> 22:02.999
I missed you though.
- Yeah?

22:02.999 --> 22:03.999
- I'm not gonna even lie.

22:03.999 --> 22:05.999
- I mean, I'm still--
- I did.

22:05.999 --> 22:07.999
- I don't know what.

22:07.999 --> 22:08.999
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

22:08.999 --> 22:10.999
- Hey.
- Are you gonna cut here?

22:10.999 --> 22:11.999
- Yeah.

22:11.999 --> 22:13.999
- I don't want to stand
and do it back there.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.999
I'd rather sit here
with you guys.

22:15.999 --> 22:16.999
- Why do you do
that to the limes?

22:16.999 --> 22:19.000
- So there's a slit and, like,
I can stick it on the outside.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.999
- So you don't have
to do it to each one?

22:21.999 --> 22:22.999
- Yeah.
- I talked to Tom, I'm like,

22:22.999 --> 22:24.999
"I'm about to go to Sur."

22:24.999 --> 22:26.999
- Three Sur bartenders
go on a trip to Vegas.

22:26.999 --> 22:27.999
Where does that leave me?

22:27.999 --> 22:29.999
I have to work all weekend?

22:29.999 --> 22:31.999
It f***ing sucks, man.

22:33.999 --> 22:34.999
- Hello.

22:34.999 --> 22:35.999
- Hey.
- Hi.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.999
- What's this?

22:37.999 --> 22:39.999
- The specials for tonight.
- The specials.

22:39.999 --> 22:40.999
- Aha, okay, what
should I have?

22:40.999 --> 22:42.999
What's good?
Hey, how about you?

22:42.999 --> 22:43.999
Do you know what's good?

22:43.999 --> 22:46.999
- Um, I would go for
the Chilean sea bass.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.999
- And how is that served?

22:48.999 --> 22:50.999
- With pomegranate butter sauce,

22:50.999 --> 22:52.999
which I would love to try

22:52.999 --> 22:53.999
'cause that sounds amazing.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.999
- How are you getting on?
Everything good?

22:55.999 --> 22:56.999
- Good, everything's great.

22:56.999 --> 22:57.999
- You're doing better?
- Mm-hmm.

22:57.999 --> 23:00.999
I got to rejuvenate
at Ariana's birthday party.

23:00.999 --> 23:01.999
- How was the birthday?
Did you all have fun?

23:01.999 --> 23:03.999
- Oh, my gosh,
it was amazing.

23:03.999 --> 23:04.999
- You had fun?
You had fun?

23:06.999 --> 23:07.999
- I wasn't invited.

23:09.999 --> 23:12.000
- Well, I didn't invite
everybody		 everybody

23:12.999 --> 23:13.999
because I didn't think
it would make sense for,

23:13.999 --> 23:15.999
like, just everybody
to come.

23:15.999 --> 23:16.999
It's my 30th birthday.

23:18.999 --> 23:19.999
You know what I mean?

23:19.999 --> 23:21.999
- Faith isn't family.
You just met her.

23:21.999 --> 23:23.999
- Faith and I have
spent more time--

23:23.999 --> 23:25.999
much more time together,
and we've talked more,

23:25.999 --> 23:27.999
and, you know,
I don't know.

23:27.999 --> 23:28.999
We've spent a lot more
time hanging out.

23:28.999 --> 23:30.999
I'm trying to find
the video to show you.

23:32.999 --> 23:36.999
- I don't know why I have been
bullied most of my life.

23:36.999 --> 23:39.999
I mean, despite on my outer
appearance, and what I wear,

23:39.999 --> 23:43.999
I'm very vulnerable,
and I'm so sensitive.

23:43.999 --> 23:46.999
Feeling lonely is the worst
feeling in the world.

23:46.999 --> 23:48.999
- Well, sometimes it
doesn't feel nice to be

23:48.999 --> 23:49.999
the only one that's
left out, Ariana.

23:49.999 --> 23:50.999
- That's not the only one.
There's lots of people--

23:50.999 --> 23:52.999
- Well, who else?
Everybody else went, did they?

23:52.999 --> 23:53.999
- Well, not everybody else.

23:53.999 --> 23:55.999
I did a back--
double backflip.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.999
- Well, you were probably doing
double backflips somewhere else,

23:58.999 --> 23:59.999
weren't you, darling?

23:59.999 --> 24:00.999
You were having fun?

24:00.999 --> 24:02.999
- I remember a lot of Mondays
in high school

24:02.999 --> 24:03.999
finding about
this supercool party

24:03.999 --> 24:06.999
that happened last Saturday,

24:06.999 --> 24:08.999
and that is a sh** feeling.

24:08.999 --> 24:10.999
I'm not trying to make
anybody else feel like that.

24:10.999 --> 24:11.999
Tom surprised me again.

24:11.999 --> 24:14.999
- Oh, well, Tom surprised me,
because you guys

24:14.999 --> 24:16.999
have let them go
to Vegas, right?

24:16.999 --> 24:18.999
- I don't tell my boyfriend
what to do.

24:18.999 --> 24:19.999
- I can't tell him what to do.
- Oh, I bet you tried.

24:19.999 --> 24:21.999
I bet you tried.
- No.

24:21.999 --> 24:23.999
- I cannot believe
in a million years

24:23.999 --> 24:25.999
that you two would let
them go to Vegas.

24:25.999 --> 24:27.999
I would not indulge Ken
for one second

24:27.999 --> 24:30.999
if he said, "I want to go
to Vegas with my friends."

24:30.999 --> 24:32.999
For what?
There's no excuse.

24:32.999 --> 24:34.999
This is just their excuse
to be naughty.

24:34.999 --> 24:36.999
So what are you gonna do
when they're running around

24:36.999 --> 24:38.999
having fun?

24:38.999 --> 24:40.000
- Tonight we'll be at Scheana's.
- Scheana's?

24:40.000 --> 24:42.999
You need to get out and have fun
and teach those guys a lesson.

24:42.999 --> 24:44.000
That's exactly what I would do.
- Get out, let's go out.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.999
I know a stripper.

24:45.999 --> 24:46.999
- I just told Tom "The more
allowances I give you

24:46.999 --> 24:47.999
"that a ring, eventually,

24:47.999 --> 24:49.999
you just have to keep
adding a carat to it."

24:49.999 --> 24:52.999
- You don't even come home
in the morning.

24:52.999 --> 24:54.999
That's what I would do.
I would not pick up the phone.

24:54.999 --> 24:57.999
I would--I'm serious.

24:57.999 --> 24:59.999
My God.
You don't get mad.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.999
- You get what?
- Even.

25:01.999 --> 25:03.999
- Right, exactly, and then some.

25:06.999 --> 25:08.999
- Here we go.

25:08.999 --> 25:10.999
Here we go.

25:10.999 --> 25:11.999
Whoo-whee!

25:11.999 --> 25:13.999
- Okay, so I think
this is the place.

25:13.999 --> 25:15.999
- Yeah?
- We're here.

25:15.999 --> 25:17.999
- Welcome to Dig This.
How we doing today?

25:17.999 --> 25:18.999
- What's up, guy?
- Hey.

25:18.999 --> 25:21.999
- Ready to have some fun
with some heavy equipment,

25:21.999 --> 25:22.999
tear up the sandbox a bit?

25:22.999 --> 25:23.999
- Yeah, what?
- Wonderful, wonderful.

25:23.999 --> 25:25.999
Now we're going to
administer the breathalyzer.

25:27.999 --> 25:29.999
We do that because you're
operating heavy equipment.

25:29.999 --> 25:31.999
We'll start with you.

25:31.999 --> 25:32.999
When this gets to zero,
you're gonna blow

25:32.999 --> 25:34.999
on that end of the tube
for five seconds.

25:34.999 --> 25:35.999
Give me a steady
stream of air.

25:35.999 --> 25:37.999
When it beeps twice,
just set it down.

25:37.999 --> 25:40.999
- If I know one thing about us,

25:40.999 --> 25:42.999
we're heavy drinkers,

25:42.999 --> 25:46.999
so...

25:46.999 --> 25:48.999
I don't know if we'll pass.
I'm hoping that we do.

25:48.999 --> 25:51.999
I know I will 'cause I haven't
drank since last night,

25:51.999 --> 25:54.000
unless I still have alcohol
in my system.

25:54.999 --> 25:56.999
- Looks good.
- Okay.

25:56.999 --> 25:58.999
- Perfect.

25:58.999 --> 26:01.999
Excellent, zero.

26:01.999 --> 26:03.999
A steady stream of air.
It's a zero.

26:03.999 --> 26:05.999
- That's--I'm used
to these things.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.999
- Oh, say no more.

26:07.999 --> 26:09.000
Excellent, all zeros.
- Yes!

26:11.999 --> 26:13.999
- You're good.
- Hang on to it.

26:13.999 --> 26:15.999
- Is it zero?

26:15.999 --> 26:17.999
- f***. f***.

26:17.999 --> 26:18.999
- He's thinking about it.
- Yes!

26:18.999 --> 26:20.999
- It's all zeros, all good.
- Yes!

26:20.999 --> 26:21.999
- God.
- Phew!

26:21.999 --> 26:22.999
- Dude, you're sweating
bullets over there.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.999
- Yeah, sweating bullets.

26:24.999 --> 26:25.999
- Now that I think about it,
I don't really think

26:25.999 --> 26:27.999
I've ever passed a breathalyzer.

26:31.999 --> 26:33.999
- Oh, man, I feel in control.

26:33.999 --> 26:35.999
This is man stuff.

26:35.999 --> 26:37.999
- What I'd like
for you to do

26:37.999 --> 26:39.999
is pull back with your left hand
all the way.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.999
- Oh, here we go.

26:41.999 --> 26:42.999
- All right, guys, perfect.

26:42.999 --> 26:43.999
- I'm here to f*** sh** up.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.999
Whoo-ee!

26:45.999 --> 26:47.999
- Now, don't drop it.
- Oh!

26:49.999 --> 26:50.999
- Not only is this gonna be

26:50.999 --> 26:52.999
one of the coolest parts
about this trip, but it's

26:52.999 --> 26:54.999
probably one of the coolest
things that I've ever done.

26:55.999 --> 26:57.999
- Oh, my God,
that's so gratifying.

26:58.999 --> 27:00.999
- Keeping your seat
straight, guys.

27:02.999 --> 27:04.999
- All clear.
- I'm spinning, baby.

27:04.999 --> 27:07.999
- Actually, it doesn't
look too bad, bud.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.999
- Hey-oh!

27:09.999 --> 27:10.999
Oh, here we go.

27:10.999 --> 27:12.999
What could be easier?

27:12.999 --> 27:14.999
- Come on.
- Whoo!

27:16.999 --> 27:18.999
- Whoo-whoo!
This is awesome.

27:18.999 --> 27:20.999
- Dude, I feel like I got two
giant balls between my legs.

27:20.999 --> 27:21.999
- You feel like you
got some balls now?

27:21.999 --> 27:23.999
- Yeah, man.
- Holy sh**, dude.

27:23.999 --> 27:25.999
- Feel like you got some balls?
- How f***ing awesome was that?

27:25.999 --> 27:26.999
- I know, that was
f***ing badass.

27:26.999 --> 27:27.999
- I need a beer now.
- Dude, that was awesome.

27:27.999 --> 27:29.999
- We just bulldozed sh**.
- Yeah.

27:29.999 --> 27:30.999
f*** yeah, we did.
- Dude.

27:30.999 --> 27:32.999
- Now we're gonna go eat
some steaks and potatoes.

27:32.999 --> 27:33.999
- I want a steak
and some beer.

27:33.999 --> 27:34.999
- Then we gonna
hammer up some drywall.

27:34.999 --> 27:35.999
I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah.

27:35.999 --> 27:37.999
We went to Vegas to move dirt.

27:37.999 --> 27:38.999
See, we're growing.

27:38.999 --> 27:40.999
We don't need women
all the time.

27:40.999 --> 27:41.999
Put a hot girl
in a bikini, though,

27:41.999 --> 27:45.000
out there while I'm moving dirt
would be really cool.

27:45.999 --> 27:46.999
- f*** yeah.
- Vegas!

27:46.999 --> 27:48.999
- f***ing guys' trip for life!

27:48.999 --> 27:50.999
Just kidding.
Just kidding.

27:51.999 --> 27:52.999
- No.
No, Jax.

27:52.999 --> 27:54.999
- What's that?
- Don't do that.

27:54.999 --> 27:56.999
Don't do that.
- You're welcome, America.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.999

28:18.999 --> 28:20.999
I love the energy of Vegas.

28:20.999 --> 28:22.999
I love how you can walk around

28:29.999 --> 28:31.999
- I mean, I just love
everything about Vegas.

28:31.999 --> 28:33.999
First of all, I brought
a little bottle.

28:33.999 --> 28:34.999
- Whoa!

much better than this.

28:54.999 --> 28:56.999
- Oh, my God, dude,
you're naked.

28:56.999 --> 28:58.999
- Jax, wait.
- Son of a bitch.

28:58.999 --> 29:01.999
- Jax, don't run away
from your feelings.

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
I mean, let's face it.

29:03.999 --> 29:05.999
We're definitely sober,
that's for sure.

29:07.999 --> 29:10.999
- No. No.
No, Jax.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.999
- Jax, don't do that.
- No, dude.

29:12.999 --> 29:14.999
- There's a reason why
guys' trips are

29:14.999 --> 29:15.999
a hallowed tradition,
you know?

29:15.999 --> 29:17.999
- Don't do that.
- What's that?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.999
- Don't do that.
- You're welcome, America.

29:20.999 --> 29:21.999
- It's like, you want to--
you want to hit

29:21.999 --> 29:23.999
the Three Stooge status,
you know?

29:23.999 --> 29:24.999
- You know, we either do
this kind of stuff...

29:24.999 --> 29:26.999
- Dude, seriously.
- Or--Or--Or, you know,

29:26.999 --> 29:27.999
we do bad things, and
that--this is normal.

29:27.999 --> 29:29.999
- Don't ever dance
like that again.

29:29.999 --> 29:32.999
- I mean, a big part of
guys' weekend is us just

29:32.999 --> 29:34.999
sitting around trying to
make each other feel

29:34.999 --> 29:36.999
as uncomfortable as possible.

29:36.999 --> 29:38.999
- Jax, what the f***
are you doing, dude?

29:38.999 --> 29:41.999
- Sorry.
- No, man.

29:41.999 --> 29:45.999
- For some reason, that
involves a lot of humping.

29:45.999 --> 29:48.999
- Hey, man.

29:48.999 --> 29:50.999
Get out of here.
Eww!

29:50.999 --> 29:51.999
The f***?
Oh, my God.

29:51.999 --> 29:53.999
- No, I'm not part
of this game.

29:53.999 --> 29:55.999
- Oh, my God.
Stop.

29:55.999 --> 29:57.999
- You gotta have your
guard up at all times.

30:05.999 --> 30:08.999
- Good work on the flat iron,
'cause I totally forgot mine.

30:09.999 --> 30:11.000

30:11.000 --> 30:12.999
♪ Shake it, shake it,

30:12.999 --> 30:15.999

30:25.999 --> 30:27.999

30:27.999 --> 30:28.999
- I'll, uh, I'll catch up
with you in a minute.

30:28.999 --> 30:30.999
- All right, we'll
see you there, Tom.

30:30.999 --> 30:31.999
- All right.
- Guys, let's go.

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:33.999 --> 30:34.999
- Going to Scheana's tonight.

30:34.999 --> 30:35.999
- Yeah?

30:35.999 --> 30:38.999
- It's gonna be for, like,
a pajama party.

30:38.999 --> 30:40.999
- Do you know what
I'm sick and tired of?

30:40.999 --> 30:42.999
- What? What?

30:42.999 --> 30:45.000
- Not kissing your stupid face.

30:45.999 --> 30:47.999
- Aww.
You get out of here.

30:47.999 --> 30:49.999
Yeah, I'm disappointed.

30:49.999 --> 30:52.999
I do wish Tom was around
for all of the reasons

30:52.999 --> 30:55.999
that I had said before,
but now that he's gone,

30:55.999 --> 30:58.999
it's okay because
I've realized I have

30:58.999 --> 31:00.999
all of these really
good friends around me

31:00.999 --> 31:01.999
that I can talk to.

31:01.999 --> 31:03.999
- All right, I'm gonna
run downstairs, I love you.

31:03.999 --> 31:05.999
I'm gonna call you in
a little while, all right?

31:05.999 --> 31:06.999
- I love you too.

31:06.999 --> 31:07.999
I'll talk to you soon.

31:07.999 --> 31:10.999
- Bye.
- Bye.

31:14.999 --> 31:16.999
- How's it going?

31:20.999 --> 31:22.999
- What's up?
- Hey, the lone straggler.

31:22.999 --> 31:23.999
- Why'd you say that?

31:23.999 --> 31:25.999
- Well, you're the
only person not in Vegas.

31:25.999 --> 31:29.999
- I think I'm honestly not
invited just because of Jax.

31:29.999 --> 31:30.999
I just feel like Jax
doesn't want me being there

31:30.999 --> 31:33.999
'cause he doesn't want me
stealing his f***ing limelight.

31:33.999 --> 31:35.999
- Well, you guys have been,
like, yelling at each other

31:35.999 --> 31:36.999
and stuff in the middle
of the restaurant.

31:36.999 --> 31:38.999
- Honestly, I swear to God,
I was really f***ed off

31:38.999 --> 31:40.999
with the way he's just been,
like, chilling with Kristen.

31:40.999 --> 31:42.999
I feel like he's just trying
to have me in a competition

31:42.999 --> 31:44.999
or something, he's trying
to do it with Lala.

31:44.999 --> 31:45.999
Like, he's trying to win
at my game, you know?

31:45.999 --> 31:47.999
If she's the prize, he's
certainly not gonna win it.

31:47.999 --> 31:50.999
- Hello.
- Hi, Lisa.

31:50.999 --> 31:51.999
- Are you chewing gum?

31:51.999 --> 31:52.999
Seriously?
- Not anymore.

31:52.999 --> 31:55.999
- Go spit it out, and we need
utensils on 10 and 11.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.999
- You want me to go
do that right now?

31:57.999 --> 31:59.999
- Yeah.

31:59.999 --> 32:02.999
- He just put that piece
of gum in his mouth.

32:02.999 --> 32:03.999
- And how's your day?

32:03.999 --> 32:05.999
You just been sitting there

32:05.999 --> 32:06.999
pissed off because
he's in Vegas,

32:06.999 --> 32:08.999
or are you kind of
dealing with it?

32:08.999 --> 32:11.999
- No, I guess
it's just so--ugh.

32:11.999 --> 32:12.999
- What is it?
What is it?

32:12.999 --> 32:14.999
What are you trying--
- It's hard to talk about.

32:14.999 --> 32:16.999
So my dad's been gone
for, like,

32:16.999 --> 32:18.999
almost two years, but--

32:19.000 --> 32:21.999
- Your father died?
Sudden?

32:21.999 --> 32:23.999
- Like, suddenly,
massive heart attack, like--

32:24.000 --> 32:25.999
- How old was he?
- 67.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.999
The biggest reason why
I wanted him to be there

32:30.000 --> 32:31.999
was because these milestone
events in my life,

32:31.999 --> 32:34.999
and, like, these
big things are what...

32:34.999 --> 32:35.999
- Of course.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.999
- Kind of bring me back.
Even though they're so happy--

32:37.999 --> 32:39.999
- He's not there.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.999
- Exactly.
- Why didn't you tell him?

32:41.999 --> 32:43.999
- I didn't want to be
that person that's, like,

32:43.999 --> 32:47.999
"Let me bring up
my painful, you know."

32:47.999 --> 32:49.999
- But it's the man
that you share your life with.

32:49.999 --> 32:50.999
- I know.

32:50.999 --> 32:52.999
- I mean, why would you
shut him out now?

32:52.999 --> 32:54.999
- It's scary.

32:54.999 --> 32:56.999
- I know Ariana
can sometimes appear

32:56.999 --> 32:58.999
a little bit
aloof, shall we say,

32:58.999 --> 33:01.999
but honesty is absolutely
paramount in a relationship.

33:01.999 --> 33:03.999
Otherwise, what do you have?

33:03.999 --> 33:04.999
- It's scary to--

33:04.999 --> 33:05.999
- What?

33:05.999 --> 33:07.999
- To know that
somebody is so--

33:07.999 --> 33:09.999
- What are you scared of?
- Important.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.999
- That's a wonderful thing.

33:12.999 --> 33:14.999
It's okay to feel
something, Ariana.

33:14.999 --> 33:17.999
- I know that
I should've felt okay

33:17.999 --> 33:18.999
with being emotionally
vulnerable with Tom

33:18.999 --> 33:20.999
and telling him this sooner

33:20.999 --> 33:24.999
because he's never once

33:24.999 --> 33:26.999
not been amazing to me.

33:26.999 --> 33:28.999
- Okay, know what?

33:28.999 --> 33:29.999
Put the tears away
and have fun tonight.

33:29.999 --> 33:30.999
- All right.

33:30.999 --> 33:32.999
- Yeah?
- I'm going to.

33:32.999 --> 33:34.999
- I want to be
at a slumber party.

33:34.999 --> 33:36.999
- We'll have a shot
for you in our PJs.

33:36.999 --> 33:37.999
- Yeah, have a shot.
Don't be naughty.

33:37.999 --> 33:40.999
I'll try.

33:46.999 --> 33:47.999
- Oh, my--
- Damn, girls, get it.

33:47.999 --> 33:49.999
- Let me see you
shake that!

34:00.999 --> 34:01.999
- Uh, where do you want this?

34:01.999 --> 34:03.999
Coffee tabes?
- Um, coffee table.

34:03.999 --> 34:06.999
- I'm putting my Sur
serving skills to the test.

34:06.999 --> 34:07.999
- Cool.
- Hi.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.999
- Hi.
- Hey, babies.

34:09.999 --> 34:11.999
- Hello. I got limes.
- Thank you.

34:11.999 --> 34:12.999
- Thank you.
- Whoo-whoo!

34:12.999 --> 34:14.999
- We have appetizers.

34:14.999 --> 34:16.999
Just if anything's getting low,
someone notice,

34:16.999 --> 34:18.999
'cause I have to save
Shay some food.

34:18.999 --> 34:20.999
Ariana and Katie
were very reluctant

34:20.999 --> 34:22.999
to let the Toms go to Vegas,

34:22.999 --> 34:24.999
but we don't need to worry about
the boys being out of town.

34:24.999 --> 34:27.999
They're the ones who
should be worrying about us.

34:27.999 --> 34:30.999
- We're gonna play
a sex question game.

34:30.999 --> 34:31.999
Scheana, how do you feel
about oral sex?

34:31.999 --> 34:33.999
Do you prefer
giving or receiving?

34:33.999 --> 34:35.999
- Um, receiving, duh.

34:35.999 --> 34:37.999
Come on. Let's be real.

34:37.999 --> 34:42.000
- I honestly like to give

34:42.999 --> 34:45.999
almost sometimes
rather than receive.

34:45.999 --> 34:47.999
Receiving, I almost feel,
like, pressured

34:47.999 --> 34:50.000
in some way to, like, like it

34:50.999 --> 34:51.999
even if I didn't like it.

34:51.999 --> 34:52.999
- Oh, that's terrible.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.999
- Like, if Tom's down there
doing that, I'm just up here,

34:55.999 --> 34:59.999
like, "What do I do with
my hands, like, eh."

34:59.999 --> 35:00.999
- How about give and receive
at the same time?

35:00.999 --> 35:02.999
- Yeah, that's nice.

35:02.999 --> 35:03.999
- Next question.

35:03.999 --> 35:06.999
- Let's be honest,
Katie's answer

35:06.999 --> 35:08.999
doesn't even count
because we know her and Schwartz

35:08.999 --> 35:10.999
are on the vacation plan,

35:10.999 --> 35:12.999
which is sex on vacation only,

35:12.999 --> 35:14.999
and they haven't traveled
in a couple of months.

35:15.999 --> 35:17.999
- Lisa came in,

35:17.999 --> 35:19.999
and she was just like,
"I can't believe you let

35:19.999 --> 35:20.999
those guys go to Vegas."
- Oh, yeah?

35:20.999 --> 35:25.999
- This is mostly a generational
gap between me and Lisa,

35:25.999 --> 35:26.999
that maybe it's
a little more old-school

35:26.999 --> 35:29.999
to try to keep your man
wrapped around your finger

35:29.999 --> 35:30.999
and keep him under thumb.

35:30.999 --> 35:32.999
It's not that I have,
like, beef with Lala.

35:32.999 --> 35:34.999
She just was like--I just--

35:34.999 --> 35:35.999
- Yeah, and Lala's
sitting there, and I'm like,

35:35.999 --> 35:37.999
"I don't have any
issue with you."

35:37.999 --> 35:39.999
- Ariana, should I just invite
her? I mean, it's not late.

35:39.999 --> 35:41.999
- That would be--please,
that would be so amazing.

35:41.999 --> 35:43.999
- I didn't invite her
'cause I just didn't want

35:43.999 --> 35:44.999
anyone to feel uncomfortable.

35:44.999 --> 35:46.000
- For sure, like, I'm not
gonna tell you not to do that.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.999
- Wait, I need to fill up
that wine glass.

35:47.999 --> 35:50.999
I'm gonna call her
and see if she answers.

35:57.999 --> 36:00.999
- Hi, little baby.

36:00.999 --> 36:01.999
- Can you come over?

36:01.999 --> 36:03.999
You live, like,
walking distance.

36:03.999 --> 36:05.000
- I don't know, are you sure?
- Yeah.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.999
- I didn't think
I was doing anything tonight,

36:06.999 --> 36:10.999
so I, like, started
getting ready for bed.

36:10.999 --> 36:11.999
- Well, we're all in pajamas.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.999
It's a pajama party,
so you would fit right in.

36:14.999 --> 36:16.999
- All right.
- Okay, bye.

36:16.999 --> 36:18.999
Lala's on her way.
She's gonna come.

36:41.999 --> 36:43.000
We've hit a point
where if I don't cheat,

36:43.999 --> 36:48.000
it is meaningful
because I could.

36:52.999 --> 36:54.999
- Vegas is f***ing awesome,

36:54.999 --> 36:57.999
but there's
a little part of me

36:57.999 --> 36:59.999
that wouldn't mind
if the girls were here.

37:02.999 --> 37:03.999
Hey!

37:03.999 --> 37:07.999
- What up, though?
What up, though?

37:07.999 --> 37:11.999
I'm here because I feel like the
olive branch has been extended.

37:11.999 --> 37:14.999
- You gotta catch up.
- You got to.

37:14.999 --> 37:16.999
- And I would be an idiot
not to take it.

37:16.999 --> 37:18.000
- You're welcome.
- This is a thing.

37:18.999 --> 37:20.999
You and a guy have been
hanging out. You're out.

37:20.999 --> 37:22.999
You start making out,
and you're like,

37:22.999 --> 37:24.999
"Okay, we're getting further."
- You're like, ah!

37:24.999 --> 37:26.999
He's gonna have,
probably,

37:26.999 --> 37:28.999
if you're making out,
a little bit of a chub.

37:28.999 --> 37:29.999
- And sometimes
you can feel that

37:29.999 --> 37:30.999
rubbing up against
your leg a little bit.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.999
- So you can
kind of tell.

37:32.999 --> 37:34.999
- Speaking of making out,
you guys kiss.

37:34.999 --> 37:36.999
I'm gonna make your boyfriends
really jealous right now.

37:36.999 --> 37:37.999
- You can go full-on
if you want, but--

37:37.999 --> 37:39.999
- Okay.
- Wait, they about to kiss.

37:39.999 --> 37:40.999
- One, two.
- Do it, boom.

37:40.999 --> 37:42.999
- Ooh, that's hot!
- Send it to the boys.

37:42.999 --> 37:43.999
- Okay, I got it.
- Yeah!

37:43.999 --> 37:45.999
- Is that a good-looking
picture though?

37:45.999 --> 37:47.999
- Wait, one more time.
- How's Ghostbar?

37:47.999 --> 37:49.999
- Our boys in Vegas
know damn well

37:49.999 --> 37:50.999
that they're not gonna be
kissing any girls,

37:50.999 --> 37:53.999
but nobody said
that we couldn't.

37:53.999 --> 37:57.999
I mean, it's just one of those
stupid double standards

37:57.999 --> 38:00.999
that I'm actually
willing to exploit.

38:00.999 --> 38:01.999
- Do it, do it, do it.
- Babe!

38:01.999 --> 38:03.999
- Let me see you
shake that!

38:03.999 --> 38:05.999
- Oh, damn, Gina!

38:05.999 --> 38:08.999
- This is not the first time
that I've made out with a girl.

38:08.999 --> 38:10.999
I've always been a girl's girl,

38:10.999 --> 38:14.999
but I'm a girl's girl
after tonight.

38:21.999 --> 38:23.999
- Damn, girls, get it!

38:23.999 --> 38:25.999
- Um, damn, girls.

38:27.999 --> 38:29.999
- Yo, what's going on?

38:36.999 --> 38:38.999
- Wow, that's really hot.

38:38.999 --> 38:41.999
- You know, I always suspected
that when girls get together

38:41.999 --> 38:43.999
and have a slumber party,
it turns into, like,

38:43.999 --> 38:45.999
a pillow fight/
make out session.

38:45.999 --> 38:47.000
Well, here's the proof.

38:47.999 --> 38:49.999
- Is that Lala?

38:49.999 --> 38:51.999
- It's Lala.

38:51.999 --> 38:52.999
- What's Lala doing there?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.999
- Hey, maybe
they kissed and--

38:54.999 --> 38:56.999
they literally kissed
and made up.

38:59.999 --> 39:01.999
- I can't have sex,
and I want it now.

39:08.999 --> 39:10.999
- Oh, God, ugh!

39:13.999 --> 39:15.999
- Jax is very turned on.

39:15.999 --> 39:17.999
- Happy birthday, buddy.

39:17.999 --> 39:19.999
- Thank you.
- I mean, we've made it.

39:19.999 --> 39:20.999
We survived all the tests.

39:20.999 --> 39:21.999
All we have to do right now

39:21.999 --> 39:24.999
is just go to bed.

39:24.999 --> 39:25.999
Make it to that bed.

39:25.999 --> 39:26.999
- Come on, I'll carry you.

39:26.999 --> 39:28.999
Come on, let's go.

39:33.999 --> 39:34.999
- We've made it
this far, guys.

39:34.999 --> 39:35.999
Let's ruin everything

39:35.999 --> 39:38.999
by, like, trying
to f*** girls.

39:51.999 --> 39:52.999
- Awesome job.
- You know what, guys?

39:52.999 --> 39:53.999
You know what?
f*** you.

39:53.999 --> 39:56.999
It's my f***ing birthday.

39:56.999 --> 39:58.000
You're gonna pay
attention to me.

39:58.999 --> 39:59.999
- What time you gotta be
at Sur tomorrow?

39:59.999 --> 40:03.999
- f***ing whenever
I f***ing feel like it.

40:03.999 --> 40:05.999
Guys, I'm really glad
I f***ing came.

40:05.999 --> 40:07.999
Peter, dude, thank you

40:07.999 --> 40:09.999
for inviting us all
together, dude.

40:09.999 --> 40:10.999
- You're welcome.
- You put the faith back

40:10.999 --> 40:11.999
in guys' weekends.
- Yeah, dude.

40:11.999 --> 40:13.999
- Thank you for f***ing
putting this together, man.

40:13.999 --> 40:15.999
- I f***ing loved this.
I loved it.

40:15.999 --> 40:18.999
I think I might--I want
to stay another night.

40:18.999 --> 40:19.999
I think we can do it again.

40:19.999 --> 40:21.999
- I can't drink anymore.

40:21.999 --> 40:23.999
- It's not easy for him
not to get laid in Vegas.

40:23.999 --> 40:24.999
- My penis--
- Dude, I saved lives.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.999
Dude, yes.

40:26.999 --> 40:27.999
- My penis stayed
in my pants the whole time.

40:27.999 --> 40:29.999
- Yes.
- This is the first time.

40:29.999 --> 40:31.999
He's never, ever--
- And he's not happy about it.

40:31.999 --> 40:33.999
Can we just have
a moment of silence

40:33.999 --> 40:35.999
for my streak coming to an end?

40:38.999 --> 40:39.999
Thank you.

40:39.999 --> 40:41.999
- I think I kissed
Tom tonight.

40:41.999 --> 40:43.999
- Yes, that happened.

40:43.999 --> 40:44.999
- I kissed Tom too tonight.

40:44.999 --> 40:46.999
- You know what's harder
than making out with girls?

40:46.999 --> 40:48.999
- What?
- Not making out with girls.

40:48.999 --> 40:49.999
- Oh, oh.
- Yeah.

40:49.999 --> 40:52.999
- I only got one girl
I want to make out with.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.999
- FaceTime?

40:55.999 --> 40:56.999
- What do you say, bunny?

40:56.999 --> 40:57.999
- Mamas!

40:59.999 --> 41:00.999
- What are you doing?

41:00.999 --> 41:01.999
- I'm drunk.

41:01.999 --> 41:02.999
- I was gonna say
you look totally sober.

41:02.999 --> 41:05.999
- Are you jealous that we're
having a pajama party?

41:05.999 --> 41:07.999
- Yes.
- I knew you would be.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.999
- I miss you now.
- I miss you.

41:09.999 --> 41:11.999
- Hey, look, maybe
I can kiss you.

41:11.999 --> 41:13.999
- I can kiss, kiss.
There was never a minute

41:13.999 --> 41:16.999
that I didn't trust Tom
to go to Vegas with the boys.

41:16.999 --> 41:17.999
It just didn't make sense,

41:17.999 --> 41:20.999
but he is my Schwartz,
and I love him.

41:20.999 --> 41:21.999
- How's it going?

41:21.999 --> 41:23.000
- Pretty good, hey.
- Hi, good.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.999
- You look really sober too.

41:24.999 --> 41:25.999
- You're gonna be mad
when you see

41:25.999 --> 41:27.999
what I'm wearing
without you.

41:27.999 --> 41:29.000
- Do you see that?
Do you see that?

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
- Slap it
and make him jealous.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
- Yep, all mine now.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Gotta go.
- I like your flannel.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.999
- Bye, good night.
- Bye, I love you.

41:35.999 --> 41:36.999
I mean, look, I love him.

41:36.999 --> 41:38.999
He's my guy.
I'm his girl.

41:38.999 --> 41:40.999
That's all I need.

41:40.999 --> 41:41.999
- Let's go gamble.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.000
Let's go play some--
let's go play some craps.

41:43.999 --> 41:44.999
Let's do it, come on.

41:44.999 --> 41:45.999
- Okay.

41:45.999 --> 41:46.999
- One last rodeo.

41:46.999 --> 41:48.999
We've made it this far, guys.

41:48.999 --> 41:51.999
Let's ruin everything by,
like, trying to f*** girls.

41:53.999 --> 41:54.999
- Yeah, on our
last night here

41:55.000 --> 41:56.999
with the last five
more minutes left.

41:56.999 --> 41:58.999
- Let's just ruin everything.

41:58.999 --> 41:59.999
- Yeah.
- By, like--

41:59.999 --> 42:01.000
- And then you guys
got my back.

42:01.999 --> 42:02.999
- Put it on social media,
yeah, yeah.

42:02.999 --> 42:03.999
- We'll tweet it.

42:03.999 --> 42:04.999
- And we'll, like,
stab each other

42:04.999 --> 42:05.999
in the back of--

42:05.999 --> 42:07.999
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- That'd be great.

42:07.999 --> 42:09.999
- Absolute deal breaker
between all of us.

42:11.999 --> 42:12.999
- No, no, come on.

42:12.999 --> 42:15.999
I mean, everybody knows
that there's that point in time

42:15.999 --> 42:18.999
when you're in Vegas
and you are up

42:18.999 --> 42:21.999
and it's time to call it quits,
walk away,

42:21.999 --> 42:23.999
put your winnings
in your pocket, call it a night.

42:23.999 --> 42:25.999
- Come on.
- All right.

42:25.999 --> 42:27.999
- f*** it, let's do it.
- Tom.

42:27.999 --> 42:28.999
Come here,
Tom, come here.

42:29.999 --> 42:31.999
- Get the f*** out
of here with that.

42:31.999 --> 42:33.999
Stop. Ouch.
- You smell like sh**.

42:33.999 --> 42:35.999
- We're not at that point yet.

42:35.999 --> 42:36.999
- You got room keys?
- I do.

42:36.999 --> 42:39.999
- Yep.
- Okay.

42:39.999 --> 42:41.999
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:41.999 --> 42:44.999
- Hey, where's Sandoval?

42:44.999 --> 42:45.999
- I lost Tom.

42:45.999 --> 42:46.999
I don't want to drop
a bomb on you at work.

42:46.999 --> 42:48.999
I did do something
kind of stupid.

42:49.999 --> 42:51.999
- You're a very dangerous
girl to be around.

42:51.999 --> 42:52.999
very, very dangerous.
- Hi.

42:52.999 --> 42:54.999
- Thanks. Hello, babe.
- Give me a kiss.

42:54.999 --> 42:56.999
- Right now I hate James.
I hate him.

42:56.999 --> 42:58.999
You need to date somebody
who has a job, who has a car.

42:58.999 --> 43:00.999
- Because I have my
sh** together.

43:00.999 --> 43:01.999
I'm not a crazy bitch
who can't work.

43:01.999 --> 43:03.999
- I think we should take a trip
that involves the girls.

43:03.999 --> 43:04.999
- I agree.

43:04.999 --> 43:05.999
- I would like for
Kristen to help us.

43:05.999 --> 43:07.999
- She still is a liability.

43:07.999 --> 43:09.999
- You're trying to act
like I'm a f***ing psycho

43:09.999 --> 43:10.999
because I don't want Kristen

43:10.999 --> 43:12.999
to go on a f***ing
birthday trip with me?

43:13.000 --> 43:15.999
- To see more of
"Vanderpump Rules," go to...
