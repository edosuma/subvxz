WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.425
If you're just joining,

00:07.466 --> 00:09.111
we are about to witness
a human consciousness

00:09.135 --> 00:11.053
reinserted into
a printed clone body.

00:11.095 --> 00:14.014
Kristina Soon is reporting from
the site of the first download.

00:14.098 --> 00:15.933
Kristina, what are scientists
saying about

00:15.975 --> 00:17.727
the implications
of today's procedure?

00:17.768 --> 00:20.563
Well, that they are effectively
reversing the upload process,

00:20.604 --> 00:23.315
bringing us closer
to endless corporeal life.

00:23.399 --> 00:26.902
Thanks, Kristina. More from you
in Cupertino in a moment.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.154
Oscar Mayer Intel.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.197
Pushing the boundaries of meat.

00:33.451 --> 00:34.869
Big night.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.121
It'll be perfect.
Everything's set.

00:37.163 --> 00:39.039
No, I was talking about
the download.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.374
That could be me soon.

00:40.416 --> 00:42.668
And there.

00:46.922 --> 00:48.382
Not bad for a dead guy.

00:48.424 --> 00:49.717
So dope, right?

00:49.759 --> 00:51.510
I don't know. It had more...

00:51.552 --> 00:53.637
wow factor in the picture.

00:53.679 --> 00:55.890
How about... Oh.

00:55.931 --> 00:57.600
This one.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.685
Yes.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.729
Yes. This is it. I love it.

01:01.771 --> 01:02.938
This just feels right.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.023
Uh...

01:04.064 --> 01:05.691
You look like a Jonas brother.

01:05.733 --> 01:06.960
Great.
Tonight's about me anyway.

01:06.984 --> 01:10.279
I don't think so.
Can I see... this one?

01:10.321 --> 01:11.947
If you upgrade
to Timberlake Plus.

01:11.989 --> 01:13.407
Okay.

for a download.

01:23.375 --> 01:26.712

It's perfect, babe. Go on.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.383
Oh, hey, hey, hey. Hi.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.384

01:32.426 --> 01:36.055

doing its job.

01:37.807 --> 01:39.809
Okay.

- Yes.

- Baby, come on.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.151
Today is our day. Right?

01:49.193 --> 01:51.278
I've been planning
every detail for a month.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.571
Okay.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.698
Good boyf.

01:54.740 --> 01:57.076
- Rianne, turn your
fucking walkie on.
- Jesus.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.079
No, Sheri needs candle duty
backup. What have I...

02:02.122 --> 02:04.708
Good move just saying yes, bro.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.294
As the account holder,
she's got all the power.

02:07.336 --> 02:08.879
- Please.
- Hey, man.

02:08.921 --> 02:10.631
You want to fight her,
it's your funeral.

02:10.673 --> 02:12.526
- I can't deal with
any more hiccups.
- Oh, shit.

02:12.550 --> 02:14.760
- I can't.
- Hey. Hey, come here.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.512
Everything is gonna be great.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.806
It's not about the food
or the decorations.

02:18.848 --> 02:20.808
-Kinda.
-It's about having
your friends and family

02:20.850 --> 02:22.977
all gathered to honor you.
All right?

02:23.018 --> 02:24.603
I'm gonna love it. I promise.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.106
Not to party poop,

02:27.147 --> 02:29.817
but upload funerals
tend to be a little, mm... lame.

02:29.859 --> 02:31.579
No, I think you're just
predicting your own,

02:31.610 --> 02:32.963
which will probably be
poorly attended,

02:32.987 --> 02:34.071
but I was very popular.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.507
I've been waiting
my whole life for this.

02:35.531 --> 02:37.449
- Tonight's gonna fucking rock.
- Yeah.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.159
Okay.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.661
Oh, shit!

02:40.703 --> 02:42.454
Are we good here?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.665
'Cause, uh, I'm gonna
go watch this on a real TV.

02:44.707 --> 02:45.791
Uh, no offense.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.126
There are about 200 people

02:47.167 --> 02:49.128
in the room here
witnessing this.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.170
You can go, too.

02:53.132 --> 02:55.384
- Ugh.
- In seconds, the consciousness

02:55.426 --> 02:57.928
of Rupert Tilford
will be reinserted

02:57.970 --> 03:01.724
into this clone body,
printed by Oscar Meyer Intel

03:01.765 --> 03:02.808
from his DNA.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.393
This is my ticket home.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.395
Tilford had the winning bid of

03:06.437 --> 03:08.731
$4 billion,
earning him the distinction of

03:08.772 --> 03:11.734
becoming the first download
in human history.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.569
Many would agree the opportunity

03:13.611 --> 03:15.613
to live again in real life
is worth any price.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.823
Okay, the team is now cueing up

03:17.865 --> 03:20.159
the reinsertion process.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.536
This will carry
thousands of terabytes of data

03:22.578 --> 03:24.288
- into the clone.
- And that data,

03:24.330 --> 03:26.624
- that's his
consciousness, right?
Correct.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.250
The machine is
a reverse Scanner,

03:28.292 --> 03:30.002
reorganizing
the synaptic connections

03:30.044 --> 03:31.295
in his brain cells.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.262
Rupert, can you hear me?

03:48.020 --> 03:49.271
They've made contact.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.363
- Uh...
- I-I smell...

03:57.404 --> 03:59.239
uh, sweat.

03:59.281 --> 04:02.326
It's fantastic.

04:02.368 --> 04:03.494
I'm me again.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.245
Can you feel any sensation?

04:05.287 --> 04:07.373
I can feel everything.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.551
Mom.

10:34.593 --> 10:36.011
You look so real.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.387
I am real, Mom.

10:37.429 --> 10:40.140
Well, I watched your head
burn off.

10:40.182 --> 10:41.391
Okay.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.310
How's the food?

10:43.352 --> 10:44.871
Oh, that's the best part.
We get to eat

10:44.895 --> 10:47.606
maple bacon doughnuts
for breakfast every day.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.691
Ooh, I've never had
one of those.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.109
Remember when

10:51.151 --> 10:52.736
I used to pull a quarter
from your ear?

10:52.778 --> 10:54.946
I can't do that now,
'cause you're in a video game.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.992
What a beautiful day

10:59.034 --> 11:03.538
for the celebration of our
dearly uploaded Nathan Brown.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.248
Brought to you by L'Oréal.

11:05.290 --> 11:09.044
Please enjoy
a randomly generated slideshow

11:09.086 --> 11:12.381
of Nathan's own memories
and iPhoto library

11:12.422 --> 11:14.633
on the screen above me.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.512
On Saturday, he ate through
one slice of chocolate cake,

11:18.553 --> 11:20.138
one ice cream cone...

11:20.180 --> 11:21.848
Aw, my PAW Patrol lamp.

11:21.890 --> 11:26.269
One slice of cheese,
one slice of salami,

11:26.311 --> 11:27.437
one lollipop, one...

11:32.359 --> 11:35.320
Ooh. Be right back.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.495
What's with the waves?

11:43.537 --> 11:45.580
I don't know.

11:45.622 --> 11:46.665
It's a setting.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.418
They-they use it
to cover nudity.

11:49.459 --> 11:52.129
Probably in this case,
jerking off.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.381
Perfect.

11:54.423 --> 11:55.757
How do you know Nathan?

11:55.799 --> 11:59.344
Oh, me?
Uh, we, uh, work together.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.595
- Mm.
- You?

12:00.637 --> 12:02.180
Engineering school.
Carnegie Mellon.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.390
I'm Bethany.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.308
- Holden.
- Glynn.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.977
Nora.

12:07.018 --> 12:10.814
So, what was Nathan like
in college?

12:10.856 --> 12:14.025
He was a well-adjusted freshman
that got hotter every year.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.987
By the end, he had a minor
in narcissism.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.947
- It was a campus full of nerds.
- Yes.

12:18.989 --> 12:21.116
So he was a big fish
in a small pond.

12:21.158 --> 12:23.660
He was a barracuda
in a fucking toilet bowl.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.914
Not cocky,
just on top of the world.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.542
- He was a good boyfriend though.
- Yeah.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.377
- True.
- Wait.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.503
You all dated him?

12:33.545 --> 12:35.064
Yeah, there was a gap
between each of us...

12:35.088 --> 12:36.673
A small gap, but a gap.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.383
Huh.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.968
Did you ever date Nathan?

12:40.010 --> 12:42.095
Oh, uh, no.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.847
I don't, I don't think
I'm his type.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.849
- At-at all.
- Really?

12:45.891 --> 12:46.892
Yeah, I think you are.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.104
Oh.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.899
I don't know.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.067
No. Try one more, one more.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.029
Ew.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.781
Stop, that's so bad.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.575
Hey. How do you think
this is going?

13:03.617 --> 13:04.993
This is going
pretty well, right?

13:05.035 --> 13:06.536
Wait, where are they going?

13:06.578 --> 13:08.371
Oh, Rams game.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.876
Hey, baby.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.350
♪ ♪

13:40.987 --> 13:44.074
Lord...

13:44.115 --> 13:46.743
I googled Nathan Brown.

13:46.785 --> 13:47.994
And I liked what I saw.

13:48.036 --> 13:51.289
Our Nathan was a son, a friend,

13:51.331 --> 13:52.832
a one-time catalog model.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.000
Two-time. Two-time.

13:54.042 --> 13:57.212
Accomplished barista...

13:57.254 --> 14:01.049
and an avid fan of
a violent children's game.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.384
What, is he doing a Mad Libs?

14:02.425 --> 14:04.594
I gave him some basic info
about you.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.430
- He's not wrong.
- No, he-he's making me
sound immature.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.057
I had big things in the works.

14:09.099 --> 14:10.976
Well, that didn't exactly
pan out.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.686
You gave Methuselah
a thousand years

14:12.727 --> 14:14.145
and he praised your name.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.730
Lord, you gave Noah

14:15.772 --> 14:18.024
950 years,

14:18.066 --> 14:20.151
hallelu!

14:20.193 --> 14:23.280
Psalm 88:10.

14:23.321 --> 14:24.990
- Do you show your wonders
to the dead?

14:26.116 --> 14:28.618
Do their spirits rise up

14:28.660 --> 14:30.912
and praise you?!

14:30.954 --> 14:35.125
So with zero seconds to spare,
goggle rings around my eyes.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.002
What? Thank God for Gina.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.545
What-what'd she do...

14:38.587 --> 14:41.590
Hey. Hey, turn it back.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.800
I'm just checking the score.

14:43.842 --> 14:45.260
Right now.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.806
So, how do you know Nathan?

14:49.848 --> 14:53.643
We won a SoCal Shoot the World
tournament back in 2030.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.521
In the gaming community,
they call me "Bear Claw."

14:56.563 --> 14:58.940
No big deal. You play?

14:58.982 --> 15:00.942
God, no. No.
But I was active duty,

15:00.984 --> 15:03.320
which is, you know,
shooting the real world.

15:03.361 --> 15:06.281
In the Army community,
they call me "corporal."

15:06.323 --> 15:07.907
Very big deal.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.743
Cool.

15:09.784 --> 15:12.537
Ah, I wish we could've given you
a ceremony that was more you.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.289
Money's just tight these days.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.082
But things are okay, right?

15:16.124 --> 15:19.794
I-I mean, you got the payout
from the business with Jamie?

15:19.836 --> 15:22.213
We got your equity shares.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.591
And to be honest,
it wasn't very much.

15:24.633 --> 15:27.927
I-I mean, Jamie said a lot
went to tying up loose ends

15:27.969 --> 15:29.971
'cause you didn't
finish the work.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.314
You're Ingrid Kannerman.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.733
Those are a lot
of hors d'oeuvres.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.402
I'm sorry, who are you?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.321
Fran Booth, investigator.

15:46.363 --> 15:47.530
Health investigator?

15:47.572 --> 15:50.659
No, a suspicious circumstances
investigator.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.453
Think of me
as a famous detective.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.955
I have questions for you
about the night of the incident.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.207
Question one...

15:58.416 --> 16:00.335
Hmm, you suddenly stiffened.

16:00.377 --> 16:01.753
Nervous?

16:03.046 --> 16:04.607
I'm just trying
to understand the context

16:04.631 --> 16:07.384
of your so-called boyfriend's
premature upload.

16:07.425 --> 16:08.802
Okay, he's my
boyfriend-boyfriend,

16:08.843 --> 16:10.387
and it was not premature.

16:10.428 --> 16:11.638
He was dying.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.264
Not according to the hospital.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.266
His vitals were going back up.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.269
In case you were hoping for a
big payout from the car company,

16:18.311 --> 16:19.437
hope for something else.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.064
Okay. Fran, is it?

16:21.106 --> 16:24.901
So there's some really amazing
deep hair conditioning masks

16:24.943 --> 16:26.778
in those gift bags over there.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.613
Maybe you should
check those out.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.240
Hair masks are for ding-dongs.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.742
Okay. I'm gonna say a few words.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.661
- I'll be listening.
- That's good.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.996
- That's why I told you.
- Yeah.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.417
Bye.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.837
Excuse me. Thank you.

16:47.048 --> 16:49.676
Thank you all for being here
to celebrate

16:49.718 --> 16:52.679
in this beautiful location,
with a well-curated menu

16:52.721 --> 16:55.140
and tasteful
floral arrangements.

16:55.181 --> 16:59.227
Though today has been
blissfully perfect in many ways,

16:59.269 --> 17:01.813
we need to remember
a tragic event

17:01.855 --> 17:04.983
that happened
to a very important person:

17:05.024 --> 17:06.192
Rupert Tilford.

17:06.234 --> 17:07.652
What?

17:07.694 --> 17:10.321
The download misfire
was a shock to us all,

17:10.363 --> 17:12.615
as men and women
of good conscience

17:12.657 --> 17:15.410
and as a global community.

17:15.452 --> 17:19.581
Now, you can focus
on the bloody aftermath...

17:19.622 --> 17:21.624
And there was a lot of blood...

17:21.666 --> 17:25.837
Or... you can focus
on those beautiful four seconds,

17:25.879 --> 17:30.675
when an upload was
back in his own body.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.218
Come on.

17:32.260 --> 17:36.848
Now, I choose to live
in those four seconds,

17:36.890 --> 17:40.059
because positive thinking
is truly the most powerful force

17:40.101 --> 17:41.603
we have in this world.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.438
Am I right?

17:43.480 --> 17:44.689
So...

17:44.731 --> 17:47.400
to those four seconds.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.322
Those four seconds!

17:52.363 --> 17:53.698
Thank you.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.243
Uh... Hey.

17:57.285 --> 18:00.038
Babe, um, can you clink
your glass again for me?

18:00.079 --> 18:02.290
- Oh. Sure, booby.
- Thanks.

18:02.332 --> 18:03.750
Whoops. One more.

18:05.043 --> 18:06.836
Hey. Hey, everyone.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.379
Um, thank you all for coming.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.632
At this time,
I would just like to ask,

18:10.673 --> 18:14.177
you know, any of my friends
if they want to say...

18:14.219 --> 18:17.847
anything... about me.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.974
I-I always knew you jerked it
to women's tennis.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.435
- Okay.
- Was it the grunting, or...?

18:23.895 --> 18:24.979
Okay.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.248
Would anyone other than Uncle...

18:26.272 --> 18:27.666
Uncle Larry,
put your fucking hand down.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.652
Anyone else at all want to
say something?

18:30.693 --> 18:33.071
Maybe a nice eulogy? Derek?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.113
Oh, he's gone.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.157
Um, okay.

18:36.199 --> 18:38.076
Uh, Bobby?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.078
Jamie?

18:40.119 --> 18:41.329
No-shows.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.331
Um...

18:43.373 --> 18:44.749
Willia...

18:44.791 --> 18:45.917
William!

18:46.918 --> 18:47.919
William.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.296
Uh, as, uh,

18:50.338 --> 18:52.340
manager of Nathan's
apartment complex...

18:52.382 --> 18:53.508
No. No, no. No.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.927
Uh, other William?

18:55.969 --> 18:57.053
He left.

18:58.388 --> 18:59.973
He was a nice guy.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.975
We both were named William.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.643
Oh, God.
Uh, let's go to New York.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.144
Maybe...

19:06.563 --> 19:07.522
Oh.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.732
Hey, Bethany, Glynn, Holden.

19:09.774 --> 19:10.942
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Hi.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.570
What?

19:13.611 --> 19:14.988
Hi.

19:15.029 --> 19:15.989
No!

19:16.030 --> 19:18.324
No more exes, please.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.577
What was wrong with my speech?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.162
Uh...

19:23.204 --> 19:25.832
well, you didn't even
mention me.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.334
I mean, not that I got
to choose any details,

19:28.376 --> 19:30.837
but to not even be mentioned?

19:30.879 --> 19:33.047
Okay, do you have something
you want to say?

19:33.089 --> 19:35.717
A month ago, I wasn't even
planning on attending

19:35.758 --> 19:37.385
my own funeral,

19:37.427 --> 19:39.804
but I really never
would've guessed

19:39.846 --> 19:41.806
that it would suck this hard.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.434
Suck?

19:44.475 --> 19:46.019
Italian cortito suit.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.812
- Oh, God.
- Boutonniere.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.106
- Minibar chips
at nine bucks a bag.

19:50.148 --> 19:52.317
- I put those back.
- How about therapy dog?

19:52.358 --> 19:53.943
- Angel service?
- Great. Great.

19:53.985 --> 19:56.029
Why don't you just delete me,
save all the money?

19:56.070 --> 19:57.071
Okay, don't tempt me.

19:58.823 --> 20:01.576
Your friend Derek made it pretty
clear I could go home with him.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.586
You're right.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.838
I'm just being ungrateful.

20:15.298 --> 20:17.425
So let's just do
whatever you want.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.093
Thank you.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.311
- This is too sad.
- Yeah.

20:28.353 --> 20:29.705
We're gonna get a table
across the street,

20:29.729 --> 20:30.939
if you want to join.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.523
Oh, uh, I can't.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.233
Long commute home.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.194
But... thanks.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.588
Yeah. It was
really great to meet you,

20:37.612 --> 20:40.698
even if it did get a little dark
towards the end there.

20:54.462 --> 20:55.880
Hey, Cousin Fran.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.340
Nice of you to come.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.217
Sorry for your loss.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.927
Do you have any enemies,

21:00.969 --> 21:02.887
and can you list them
in order of most likely

21:02.929 --> 21:04.472
to want to kill you
to least likely?

21:04.514 --> 21:05.932
What? What is this about?

21:05.974 --> 21:08.101
I'm helping your mom sue
Google Motors.

21:08.142 --> 21:11.396
It is my theory
your car was tampered with.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.731
But you're not an investigator.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.025
You're a middle school
gym teacher.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.111
I'm excellent at puzzles.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.030
Okay. Well...

21:21.072 --> 21:23.241
I don't remember
having any enemies.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.077
But I have been having
some memory problems lately.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.453
Oh, just like your car.

21:27.495 --> 21:28.913
Interesting.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.000
Right.

21:32.041 --> 21:35.294
- Well, enjoy the snacks, Fran.
- I have.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.974
Please grab a L'Oréal
gift bag on your way out.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.392
Thank you.

21:53.396 --> 21:56.733
You know I didn't mean those
things I said before, right?

21:56.774 --> 21:58.401
I know, babe.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.821
Best funeral ever.

22:01.863 --> 22:03.406
Yeah.

22:03.448 --> 22:05.074
It was.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.414
Okay, Rianne! Where are you?

22:13.750 --> 22:15.626
Rianne?

22:16.669 --> 22:18.087
Yo, dog.

22:18.129 --> 22:19.589
Check it.

22:23.384 --> 22:25.470
Hmm.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.224
That you?

22:30.266 --> 22:31.392
Yeah.

22:31.434 --> 22:33.603
The new Botox Babies dropped.

22:33.644 --> 22:35.855
I saved it to watch together.

22:35.897 --> 22:38.316
Oh, yes.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.859
You're the best.

22:39.901 --> 22:41.444
All right, give me two seconds.

22:41.486 --> 22:44.572
Just want to see if someone
is working late in L.A.

22:47.450 --> 22:49.160
Call Josh Pitzer.

22:51.329 --> 22:52.705
Josh Pitzer.

22:52.747 --> 22:54.082
Mr. Pitzer. Hi.

22:54.123 --> 22:55.875
Nora Antony from New York.

22:55.917 --> 22:57.335
Christ, it's, like,
1:00 a.m. there.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.544
Why are you stalking me?

22:58.586 --> 23:00.838
I had a couple questions
about Nathan Brown, who came in

23:00.880 --> 23:04.092
with Jamie Arpaz to talk
about a project called Beyond.

23:04.133 --> 23:06.219
I'm not going to confirm
or deny any of that,

23:06.260 --> 23:08.012
and the fact
you have knowledge of it

23:08.054 --> 23:10.223
tells me that someone's
broken an NDA, so...

23:10.264 --> 23:12.350
Nathan Brown is dead.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.727
I was just at his funeral.

23:14.769 --> 23:16.354
Wow.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.273
They were both so young. Um...

23:19.315 --> 23:21.776
I mean, I was angry

23:21.818 --> 23:24.570
at the one who refused to sell,
but I would never want this.

23:24.612 --> 23:26.072
Which one died?

23:26.114 --> 23:28.407
Was it the shy one or the-the
really good-looking guy?

23:28.449 --> 23:30.785
The really good-looking guy.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.412
Tell me, why did they refuse
your investment?

23:33.454 --> 23:36.082
They didn't.
I mean, I don't know

23:36.124 --> 23:38.960
who you're talking about,
and none of that ever happened.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.180
Jamie.

23:51.222 --> 23:52.682
The person at 2-1-3-5-

23:52.723 --> 23:54.100
M-percent-sign-

23:54.142 --> 23:57.478
5-7-3-1-8-9-2 is not available.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.564
To leave a message,
begin speaking at the tone.

24:00.690 --> 24:03.359
Hey. It was my funeral today.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.278
Yeah. Derek was there.

24:05.319 --> 24:06.612
He was a huge dick.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.948
I guess he was
hitting on Ingrid.

24:08.990 --> 24:11.492
Uh... oh, but I had a nice toast
given to me

24:11.534 --> 24:14.537
by my apartment manager
William, so...

24:14.579 --> 24:16.581
that was a huge highlight.

24:16.622 --> 24:19.792
Anyway, it was just weird
seeing everybody.

24:19.834 --> 24:22.503
Or, well, almost everybody.

24:23.754 --> 24:25.173
Give me a call sometime, man.

24:25.214 --> 24:27.216
Looks like I'll be here
for a while.

24:27.258 --> 24:30.887
Unless Ingrid decides
to stop paying the bills.

24:33.014 --> 24:34.599
Okay.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.393
I've had about enough
of today, but...

24:37.435 --> 24:39.770
you know,
tomorrow's a new one, right?

24:39.812 --> 24:41.814
Maybe I'll talk to you then.
