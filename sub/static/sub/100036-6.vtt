00:01.000 --> 00:03.237
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.271 --> 00:04.805
Mom! Kevin!
- Hey.
-What's up, buddy?

00:04.838 --> 00:05.973
What do you say?
Get me up high.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.541
There it is.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.077
Stay the hell away from my wife.

00:09.110 --> 00:12.246
She is her daddy's world.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.715
I want more for her
than you can offer her.

00:14.748 --> 00:18.586
I will do everything I can
to stop this.

00:20.954 --> 00:24.325
I did have a really nice time
tonight.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.893
Okay.

00:25.926 --> 00:27.361
You can come inside for a water.

00:27.395 --> 00:28.596
All right.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.098
A water.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.935
Every part of my body aches
like death right now.

00:34.968 --> 00:36.070
Do you want to have sex?

00:36.104 --> 00:38.172
And I'm cured. You're a witch.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.008
All right.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.010
Okay, you can look.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.278
Schwing.

00:45.946 --> 00:48.416
Stop. That's my spot. Stop.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.918
Okay, what's the safe word?

00:50.951 --> 00:52.453
Spatula?

00:58.892 --> 01:00.728
Wait.

01:00.761 --> 01:03.197
Promise me we'll always be hot
for each other.

01:03.231 --> 01:06.267
Easiest promise I'll ever make.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.454
Not even if you paid me in gold.

01:30.324 --> 01:35.924
<font color="#FFA500"> Extracted from MKV & Synchronized By X Person </font></font>

01:46.006 --> 01:49.243
You are... insatiable.

01:49.277 --> 01:50.644
Only for you.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.817
I really want to.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.086
But I promised my mom

01:59.119 --> 02:01.088
I would have brunch with her.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.858
Killed the mood.

02:04.892 --> 02:07.561
-Sorry.
-Killed the mood.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.532
Do you think

02:11.565 --> 02:13.867
you could maybe drop me off
at my parents'?

02:13.901 --> 02:16.304
'Cause Jenny has my car.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.306
Please?

02:18.339 --> 02:20.308
Come on. It's 20 minutes away.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.042
Yeah, no, it--
No, it's fine.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.678
It's not that. I just, um...

02:24.712 --> 02:27.681
I don't think your parents
really approve of me

02:27.715 --> 02:30.684
after that first dinner
at the club.

02:30.718 --> 02:33.120
- What?
- I just...

02:33.153 --> 02:36.123
Think I was talking about myself
too much.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.125
Jack, you never talk
about yourself.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.194
I loved it.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.630
Okay.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.198
Okay, okay, fine,
I'll give you a ride.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.466
But I just want you to know,

02:45.499 --> 02:47.668
there is no such thing
as a free brunch.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.103
*

03:04.785 --> 03:06.220
Dad, come on. Let's go.

03:06.254 --> 03:09.223
Whoa! Randall,
you're-you're like a ninja.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.491
- Get dressed.
I got to go to school..

03:10.524 --> 03:12.025
It's 6:00 a.m., bud.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.194
I want to get there early
to talk to Mr. Lawrence.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.196
- He gave me a book to read.
- Mr. Lawrence again.
-Yeah?

03:16.230 --> 03:18.599
-Mr. Lawrence give you the book
about the tickle monster?
-Stop. Dad, stop! Stop.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.268
- Tickle monster is...
- My God.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.536
Something died in your mouth.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.272
- Did it?
- Go brush your teeth.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.106
- Come on. Let's go.
- You know what,

03:26.139 --> 03:27.541
I think...

03:27.575 --> 03:29.277
I think I want to meet
this Mr. Lawrence.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.445
He's made quite an impression
on you.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.414
Parent-teacher conferences
are next month.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.516
Or today.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.584
-Yeah.
-Okay?

03:36.617 --> 03:38.286
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.055
Mr. Lawrence.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.957
Randall.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.059
This is the latest
you've ever been early.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.801
Korey Lawrence,

03:53.834 --> 03:54.868
Randall's English teacher.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.270
Jack Pearson, Randall's father.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.706
I've heard a lot of great things
about you.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.874
Well,

04:00.908 --> 04:03.444
your son is
a very curious young man.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.213
He asks a lot of questions,
yeah.

04:07.615 --> 04:10.584
So, how's Notes of a Native Son
going?

04:10.618 --> 04:12.620
- Great.
- When James Baldwin was ten,

04:12.653 --> 04:14.622
he wrote a play
his teacher directed.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.890
Hey. You got a director.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.559
Now you just need
to write a play, right?

04:20.827 --> 04:22.963
-Hey, it was really nice
to meet you.
-Yeah.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.998
You have a very special kid
here.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.167
I agree.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.169
Randall, your mom's
gonna pick you up today.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.170
Okay.

04:30.203 --> 04:31.505
Love you.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.141
So...

04:34.174 --> 04:35.643
...how far did you get?

04:35.676 --> 04:38.879
- "The Harlem Ghetto."
- Yeah.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.484
Wilkins is freezing me out.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.253
Yeah, well, you did cancel
on him twice.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.655
Screw it.
I'm going over there.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.823
-To say what?
-I'm gonna ask him

04:49.857 --> 04:52.259
if I vote for his housing bill--
with revisions--

04:52.292 --> 04:55.763
whether he'll support my grocery
store in the food desert.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.331
Actually, no.
I'm gonna tell him.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.433
-Yeah, you are.
-Yeah.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.935
-Yeah...
-Yeah.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.771
Come on.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.706
- No, no, no.
- I'm telling you, I'm up

05:05.739 --> 05:07.541
five after nine, right,
and then the back tightens.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.710
And I still had to swi...

05:09.743 --> 05:11.879
Morning, gentlemen.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.181
Sorry to interrupt
the golf banter.

05:14.214 --> 05:17.451
Councilman, if this conversation
is gonna start or end

05:17.485 --> 05:20.187
with the words "affordable
groceries" or "food desert,"

05:20.220 --> 05:21.422
you can keep walking.

05:22.490 --> 05:25.292
Actually, um, Councilman, no.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.529
I know I had to cancel
on you twice,

05:28.562 --> 05:30.163
and I wanted
to make it up to you.

05:30.197 --> 05:32.500
So, um,

05:32.533 --> 05:35.068
if you ever wanted
to get onto Stillbrooke,

05:35.102 --> 05:36.537
I have an in.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.706
-Stillbrooke?
-Two-month wait for a tee time.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.141
And, of course,
Pearson has an in.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.342
Ha-ha-ha.

05:42.376 --> 05:45.245
Yes, 'cause I'm a carpetbagger
with rich friends,

05:45.278 --> 05:48.015
and you men of principle
don't want any part of that.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.750
My offer stands.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.752
It was nice talking to you.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.221
Well, what about today?

05:55.222 --> 05:57.157
Today?

05:57.190 --> 05:58.358
I'll make a call.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.561
We could use a fourth.

06:00.594 --> 06:04.932
Thanks, but, 
golf's not really my bag.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.368
Golf. Bag.

06:08.402 --> 06:09.770
Um, do you still want me?

06:09.803 --> 06:11.338
We do now.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.541
Ours is a money game.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.209
All right.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.281
God.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.918
Just...

06:29.322 --> 06:30.791
Okay, what's wrong?

06:30.824 --> 06:32.726
Aw, I'm just...

06:32.760 --> 06:34.361
I'm creeping on my ex.

06:35.629 --> 06:36.864
What's that even mean?

06:38.899 --> 06:41.268
I'm Internet stalking her.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.704
God, you're old.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.208
It's my-my ex, Zoe.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.445
Her documentary won a prize
at this Rome film festival,

06:51.479 --> 06:52.913
and she's posted
all these photos.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.782
And every single one,
she's with this hot guy.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.216
See that?

06:56.249 --> 06:57.618
What do you think of that?
Just friends?

06:57.651 --> 06:59.587
- Yeah. Yeah, definitely.
- Yeah?

06:59.620 --> 07:00.754
Yeah.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.155
But they're also having sex.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.724
Aw.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.925
-What is this...
-What are-- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.760
-No, no, no. What are you doing?
-I'm trying to make

07:06.794 --> 07:08.462
-the picture bigger. What...
-Well, you didn't make it
bigger.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.297
You touched the heart, man.
You touched the heart.

07:10.330 --> 07:12.132
-Now she knows I'm stalking her.
-What's your problem?

07:12.165 --> 07:14.001
-I look like an--
What's my problem?
-Yeah.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.303
Everything here sucks.
That's my problem.

07:17.337 --> 07:18.806
You know,

07:18.839 --> 07:22.009
you don't need to stick around
here for my court hearing.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.777
Yeah, no, I really do need

07:23.811 --> 07:25.178
to stick around here
for your court hearing.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.180
I told your vet counselor
that I would.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.482
Which means...

07:28.516 --> 07:31.585
a few more weeks.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.857
Let's do something though.
You know?

07:36.890 --> 07:38.859
You want to go in--
You want to go for a hike?

07:38.892 --> 07:41.161
-I've had more than enough hikes
with you, kid.
-Okay.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.996
Here we go.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.665
Go to a meeting, Kevin.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.867
Yeah, thanks.
Just went to a meeting.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.869
Go to another one.

08:05.586 --> 08:08.421
Relax. It's okay.

08:09.422 --> 08:12.059
Hey, Mr. Malone.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.994
You...

08:14.027 --> 08:15.395
going out to play some golf?

08:15.428 --> 08:17.631
No, no. I'm just gonna go
hit some balls.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.199
Do you play?

08:20.233 --> 08:21.201
Not really.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.836
I mean,

08:22.870 --> 08:25.539
sometimes I'll do a twilight
round over at Swenson.

08:25.573 --> 08:28.175
You want to join me?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.678
You know what,
I got a lot of errands today.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.746
Thank you, though, sir.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.246
All right. Some other time.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.850
Are you sure?

08:36.884 --> 08:38.351
I think it's really sweet

08:38.385 --> 08:41.354
that my dad wants
to get to know you more.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.759
Mr. Malone.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.028
Maybe I will join you.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.029
Come on!

08:49.062 --> 08:50.263
Thank you.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.100
It'll be fun.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.868
- Tobe.
- Yeah.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.570
You left the onesies
in the washer too long.

08:57.605 --> 08:58.939
They sat in the washer too long,

08:58.972 --> 08:59.940
and now they're all mildewy.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.341
Okay, I'm-I'm sorry.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.777
I-I'm operating
on-on two hours of sleep.

09:03.811 --> 09:06.446
I can't be good at laundry
and also work enough

09:06.479 --> 09:08.882
to save money
for Jack's college tuition,

09:08.916 --> 09:10.550
which, accounting for inflation,

09:10.584 --> 09:12.552
will be $6 million a year

09:12.586 --> 09:14.254
by the time
he's ready to go to school.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.790
Okay, well, I'm operating
on two hours of sleep, too.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.592
And I know I don't have a job,
but at least your nipples

09:18.626 --> 09:19.927
don't feel like chew toys.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.629
Wait, are you getting rid
of those?

09:21.662 --> 09:22.630
They're so nice.

09:22.663 --> 09:26.066
Um, these are way too big
for me now.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.802
So I am donating them, yes.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.470
I thought
they were your favorite.

09:30.503 --> 09:31.739
Don't get rid of 'em.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.240
Okay.

09:33.273 --> 09:36.409
Okay. What?

09:36.443 --> 09:38.478
Nothing.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.114
Never mind. I'll keep 'em.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.118
Tobe, what is going on?

09:45.152 --> 09:47.955
We've been snippy with each
other for the past two weeks.

09:47.988 --> 09:52.125
Yeah, well, I'll tell you
what hasn't been going on.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.494
I'll tell you what hasn't
been going on for nine months

09:54.527 --> 09:56.329
and 23 days.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.431
We're tired.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.668
And Jack is sleeping
right next to us.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.103
I know. But he can't, like...

10:03.136 --> 10:04.905
can't see us.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.406
Um, he can hear us.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.607
You.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.276
So, y-you know what, we...

10:09.309 --> 10:11.111
we need to get out of here.
All right?

10:11.144 --> 10:12.846
We need to--
we need to find a...

10:12.880 --> 10:15.783
an environment
that is more conducive to...

10:15.816 --> 10:17.417
lovemaking.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.586
Okay.
And when are we gonna do that?

10:19.619 --> 10:20.587
I don't know. Today?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.588
How 'bout today?

10:21.621 --> 10:22.990
I already took the day off.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.424
We can get your mom

10:24.457 --> 10:25.926
and Miggy Stardust to come over.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.327
They've been dying to babysit.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.762
They've been begging us
to go out more.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.130
Tobe, I don't know.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.132
No, you do know.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.702
You know we have to do this.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.770
We need to do this.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.538
For the sake of our sex life,

10:38.571 --> 10:40.841
call your mother.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.275
-Okay.
-Please call her.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.610
-I'm going to.
-Please start dialing.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.012
Okay.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.851
- You got it,
you got it, you got it..

10:50.884 --> 10:52.219
Okay. Ooh.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.620
Hey.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.724
-Thanks. I had that, by the way.
-Yeah.

10:56.757 --> 11:01.729
Yeah, it's just, rep 99 and 100
are typically the hardest ones.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.663
-Sure. You're back.
-Yeah.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.866
I'm just trying to stay out
of trouble, you know,

11:05.899 --> 11:07.968
not that you could actually get
into any trouble in this town.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.337
- Mind if I...?
- You're gonna do some pull-ups?

11:10.370 --> 11:11.972
-Yeah.
-You want a boost? Wha...?

11:12.005 --> 11:14.041
Okay. She's got it.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.909
She has got it.
Wow. That's...

11:15.943 --> 11:17.477
impressive.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.147
-Here you go, Kevin.
-Hey.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.648
-The usual.
-Thank you.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.084
That's... You don't have
to deliver my...

11:24.117 --> 11:26.219
Oxi-Protein PB Energy Spike?

11:26.253 --> 11:28.021
-And did you add the...?
-Chia.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.589
-Yes.
-Wow.

11:29.622 --> 11:30.891
You're like my phone
anticipating my...

11:30.924 --> 11:33.660
- Words.
- Okay.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.495
Technically, you're not supposed
to have drinks

11:35.528 --> 11:38.665
around the workout stations,
but I'll let it go this time.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.433
Well, thank you
for letting it go this time.

11:40.467 --> 11:43.236
I appreciate it.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.374
The service here's amazing.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.043
Yeah. She wrote her number
on your cup.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.679
Hey! Look at that.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.682
No. No.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.617
You know, AA discourages
romantic relationships

11:57.650 --> 11:59.352
in the first year.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.022
-And drinking.
-Wow. You really sold that.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.623
Talk to your husband?

12:03.656 --> 12:05.625
Not since the hockey game.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.427
Really?

12:07.460 --> 12:09.462
Divorce is on the table, right?

12:09.496 --> 12:11.364
You don't have all this time.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.767
Plus, you know what?
He could just meet someone else.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.903
Like, take my ex,
for instance-- Zoe, right?

12:15.936 --> 12:18.471
It's only been, like, six
months, but yet, here she is,

12:18.505 --> 12:20.808
jet-setting around the planet
with some

12:20.841 --> 12:22.976
sandwich artist guy.
What do you think?

12:23.010 --> 12:24.444
She into him?

12:24.477 --> 12:26.546
Well, 20 bucks says
they had bathroom sex

12:26.579 --> 12:28.248
right before
they took this picture.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.350
*

12:31.518 --> 12:32.786
She's gorgeous.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.822
-Yeah.
-Why'd you guys break up?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.159
She didn't want kids.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.394
And you do?

12:41.428 --> 12:43.096
Well, yeah, I want kid...

12:43.130 --> 12:46.133
Why do you act all skeptical
and, like, surprised?

12:46.166 --> 12:48.235
I don't know.
You don't seem... motivated.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.003
You just moved
to the middle of nowhere,

12:50.037 --> 12:51.939
and you spend all your time
with your grumpy uncle, and...

12:51.972 --> 12:53.640
Yeah, to help him out.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.943
It's temporary. Trust me,
I'll get back in the saddle.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.644
I'm just saying,
you're not getting any younger.

12:57.677 --> 13:01.148
I'm not getting any younger?
I'm 30, like, something.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.682
I'm sorry. I missed that.
You're 30...?

13:02.715 --> 13:04.084
-Can you enunciate a little?
-I'll enunciate, okay?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.485
-Just enunciate.
-Okay, here it goes.

13:05.518 --> 13:06.753
You are very annoying.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.088
All right? Come on.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.357
Spot me. Grab the 45s
if you can lift them.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.392
*

13:15.528 --> 13:20.100
What you want is what you get
at McDonald's today.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.035
- That swing...
- Hey, bud.

13:22.069 --> 13:25.005
-Hey.
-That fantastic touch
around the green.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.941
- That smile.
His name
is Tiger Woods.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.343
Mr. Lawrence said he's gonna
change the game of golf.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.145
Yeah, I've heard of him.

13:32.179 --> 13:35.815
Tiger Woods has won the world
junior title six times.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.388
In fact, Tiger has won
so many trophies,

13:41.421 --> 13:43.790
his mother says they can't
all fit in the house.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.859
Some of his are stashed
in the garage.

13:45.893 --> 13:48.628
Hey, how about tomorrow
after school,

13:48.661 --> 13:51.564
you and me, we...
we go play some?

13:51.598 --> 13:53.066
Golf?

13:53.100 --> 13:55.168
-Really?
-Yeah.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.704
Yeah, we'll go hit some balls
at the range first,

13:57.737 --> 13:59.539
and then we'll go par three.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.309
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.377
Sure. Sure!

14:04.411 --> 14:06.813
Okay. Cool.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.751
But I thought
you didn't like golf.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.723
It wasn't the right fit for me,

14:16.756 --> 14:20.393
and my ball always seemed
to find the water, but...

14:20.427 --> 14:23.596
I think
you might be cut out for it.

14:30.470 --> 14:34.441
Okay, gents, dollar a hole,
two dollar Nassau,

14:34.474 --> 14:35.875
50 cent skins.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.511
Pearson, you're up.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.215
Okay.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.353
I'll say it again, gentlemen.

14:48.421 --> 14:51.124
I don't have a very good history
with this game.

14:51.158 --> 14:54.561
As in, I have only played
one time.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.272
Fore!

15:06.506 --> 15:08.475
Sorry!

15:11.178 --> 15:13.480
- Boy.
- Bubba.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.615
Yeah.

15:17.084 --> 15:20.053
-You're in the wrong cart.
-I sure am.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.089
Sure as hell am.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.695
*

15:40.840 --> 15:43.510
Ou est le métro, madame?

15:43.543 --> 15:45.412
Ooh, la, la.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.015
What did you just say?

15:48.048 --> 15:51.451
I said, "Where can I find
the subway, miss?"

15:51.484 --> 15:53.253
It's the only French I remember

15:53.286 --> 15:54.687
after backpacking
through Europe.

15:58.992 --> 16:02.495
Um, can we dim the lights just
so it's a little more romantic?

16:02.529 --> 16:03.997
As you wish.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.033
Setting the mood...

16:07.500 --> 16:09.969
Wow.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.808
My God, you are so hunky.

16:15.842 --> 16:19.112
* I don't need what you need,
I'm so unbothered by you... *

16:21.481 --> 16:24.717
Yeah, I remember.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.854
Like riding a bike.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.263
It's okay.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.732
It's not...
I just have...

16:39.766 --> 16:42.402
I just have a lot on my mind.
It's...

16:42.435 --> 16:44.003
Like what, babe?

16:44.037 --> 16:48.475
I just need a minute
to clear my brain, you know?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.477
Just...

16:50.510 --> 16:52.979
empty my mind. Um...

16:53.012 --> 16:54.514
Okay.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.753
Want to watch Turner Classics?

17:02.622 --> 17:04.691
It's a great idea.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.858
Yup, Turner Classic Movies.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.895
TCM-- that'll,

17:08.928 --> 17:10.762
get me going.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.667
-Well, here we are again.
-Yes.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.540
You are gonna need
to find the right clothes.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.777
What? I thought we were just
gonna hit some balls.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.213
Well, it doesn't matter.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.080
You need
to wear a collared shirt

17:28.115 --> 17:29.716
here at the club and no jeans.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.784
You know what?

17:31.818 --> 17:33.453
I forgot my credit card.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.588
No, no, no, it's on me.
What size shoes do you wear?

17:35.622 --> 17:37.224
No, sir, I don't feel
comfortable you buying me...

17:37.257 --> 17:39.459
Hey, Dave?
I'm playing with Johnson.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.893
You want to join?

17:40.927 --> 17:43.029
Sure. Sure.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.531
Yeah, no.
We'll meet you right outside.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.965
Okay.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.534
Yeah.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.402
Gonna take a lot more

17:49.436 --> 17:50.937
than lowering the speed limit
to 55

17:50.970 --> 17:53.206
to reduce our dependency on gas.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.543
Yeah, what's your take
on OPEC, Jack?

17:56.576 --> 18:00.580
Well, I know the lines are long
where I work.

18:02.649 --> 18:05.252
You work at a gas station?

18:06.486 --> 18:08.721
Yeah. Part-time mechanic
at Vine Auto

18:08.755 --> 18:10.757
when I'm not helping my buddy
frame houses.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.893
Well, you hear that, Merrick?
Jack frames houses.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.563
Doesn't your insurance company
specialize in construction?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.265
Yeah, mostly umbrella liability.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.666
Well, you must need smart guys.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.734
Give Jack your card, Merrick.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.137
Maybe he can come in
next week for an informational.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.572
- Sure.
- It's-it's not necessary.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.106
-No, no.
-Hey.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.475
Thank you for that.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.543
There's hope for you yet.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.481
Bam!

18:34.514 --> 18:36.316
You didn't win the Masters,
Bill.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.117
I mean, come on.

18:38.151 --> 18:41.921
You triple-bogeyed
the second hole.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.023
- Well... are you sure?
- Four.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.292
Yeah, I am sure.
- Okay.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.126
-Ask my caddy.
-Yeah.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.596
- There's a hundred
in it for you.
- I'm sure there is.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.764
-Better be sure...
-Gin and tonic.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.099
-Double.
-Double or triple?

18:53.132 --> 18:54.601
I try.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.469
-Triple.
-Can you back it up?

18:58.538 --> 19:01.608
Wow. Look at us?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.643
Yeah.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.948
We should play for $1,000.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.283
A grand? Really?

19:10.317 --> 19:12.018
That's what Michael Jordan bets.

19:12.051 --> 19:13.620
Okay, M.J., you're up.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.588
Okay.

19:17.924 --> 19:21.594
Mr. Lawrence says Tiger Woods is
gonna break barriers in golf.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.800
Great putt.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.537
Mr. Lawrence says I'm breaking
barriers at Hanes Academy, too.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.405
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.374
'Cause they never had
a black kid on the debate team.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.378
I didn't know that.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.879
Look at you.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.650
Nice!

19:43.683 --> 19:46.319
- Yeah, I'm not saying
it'll be as hard

19:46.353 --> 19:50.189
for me as it was for Jackie
Robinson and Muhammad Ali, but

19:50.223 --> 19:53.660
it'll still be hard for me,
you know?

19:53.693 --> 19:55.662
You're gonna do just fine,
Randall.

19:55.695 --> 19:59.332
You are insanely smart
and charming, and you're gonna

19:59.366 --> 20:01.234
do just fine wherever
you want to go in life.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.536
Thanks.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.438
You know, when I was younger,

20:05.472 --> 20:08.708
I never felt welcome
at country clubs.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.843
People thought I...

20:10.877 --> 20:14.781
I didn't... make enough money
or have the right job.

20:14.814 --> 20:18.017
Probably why I stopped playing.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.820
I let those people get to me.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.856
That's not what I'm saying, Dad.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.925
No, I...
I know what you're saying.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.461
I do, and I'm gonna
do everything in my power

20:28.495 --> 20:31.631
to make sure
that nobody gets in your way

20:31.664 --> 20:33.666
or holds you back.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.771
Okay.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.807
Thanks.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.716
Ooh.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.719
Right in the drink.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.721
Dave, you should buy the kid
a lake house.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.989
He loves the water.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.258
You're up, Dave.
Show us the way.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.964
-Thank you, Sam.
-Sometime today.

21:07.199 --> 21:09.101
He liked it so much, right,

21:09.135 --> 21:10.937
that now every time we go
over to the mayor's house,

21:10.970 --> 21:12.839
my wife has to make him
potato salad.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.843
You know, the one thing
about potato salad...

21:16.876 --> 21:18.144
They're off the green.
You can hit.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.449
Right on.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.628
I'll walk.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.204
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:45.237 --> 21:47.273
Slow everything down.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.609
You're too fast.
Look.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.545
It's just back... and through.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.647
Tempo.

22:04.223 --> 22:05.892
Okay.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.660
Slowing down really helps.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.028
Thanks for the tip.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.033
*

22:17.036 --> 22:18.671
I also ran track.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.139
Now I think

22:20.172 --> 22:21.708
I'm gonna go back
to grad school and maybe

22:21.741 --> 22:24.811
get a degree in kinesiology
or nutrition.

22:24.844 --> 22:28.214
Yeah. I am very much
into nutrition.

22:28.247 --> 22:29.982
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.684
Like, take now
for instance.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.152
I'm starving, you know?

22:33.185 --> 22:34.754
And we've been sitting here
for 20 minutes

22:34.787 --> 22:36.322
and I've yet to see a menu.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.257
I'm starting
to realize that,

22:38.290 --> 22:40.927
people from small towns
are never in a hurry.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.094
* She's living in L.A. *

22:42.128 --> 22:43.496
Small towns aren't for everyone.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.665
But I remind myself

22:45.698 --> 22:47.099
of something Richard Russo
once said.

22:47.133 --> 22:49.736
-Yeah.
-"People in small towns,

22:49.769 --> 22:51.771
"more than in big cities,

22:51.804 --> 22:53.840
share a destiny."

22:53.873 --> 22:55.842
*

22:55.875 --> 22:57.610
Well, I like that.

22:57.644 --> 22:59.946
-* They say it goes... *
-Share a destiny.

22:59.979 --> 23:03.115
I feel like,

23:03.149 --> 23:05.284
destiny sort of brought me here,
actually.

23:05.317 --> 23:06.686
Yeah.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.521
But do-do you see yourself
settling down

23:08.555 --> 23:10.790
in a town like Bradford
after grad school?

23:10.823 --> 23:15.094
I suppose if I met
the right person

23:15.127 --> 23:18.431
and he wanted to live here,
I would.

23:18.465 --> 23:20.533
It's a perfect town
to raise kids.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.536
I love kids.

23:23.570 --> 23:24.937
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.439
See? There,
we have something in common.

23:26.473 --> 23:27.907
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.783
Charlie, I've changed my mind.
I'll go with the ribeye.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.951
-How would you like that, sir?
-Rare.

23:38.985 --> 23:41.654
Just knock off the horns
and wipe its ass.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.800
Hey, seriously, Jack,

23:53.833 --> 23:55.401
call me if you want to come in
for an interview.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.737
Yeah, you two should set up
a time for next week.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.772
Well, that, 
won't be necessary,

23:59.806 --> 24:01.440
but thank you, Merrick.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.014
Okay.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.522
You okay, bud?

24:17.356 --> 24:18.758
Yeah.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.527
You sure?

24:20.560 --> 24:23.996
I mean, you barely said a word
in the last couple of holes.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.768
I don't think I want
to play anymore.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.269
Randall, c-come on.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.638
We got four more holes to go.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.305
You know we don't quit
what we started.

24:33.339 --> 24:35.341
We quit the dojo.

24:35.374 --> 24:38.010
Do you remember that dojo
we went to a few years ago

24:38.044 --> 24:40.312
with all the other
black families?

24:40.346 --> 24:41.781
Yeah.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.216
We went a few times,
but then we stopped.

24:44.250 --> 24:47.987
W-- You said you didn't want
to learn karate anymore.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.356
Yeah, but you won't let me quit
soccer or baseball.

24:50.389 --> 24:52.024
You don't want me to quit golf.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.861
I ju-- I-I don't quite follow
you here, Randall.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.497
Forget it.
Can we please just go home?

24:58.531 --> 24:59.799
H-Hold on a second.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.201
Where is this coming from?

25:02.234 --> 25:04.370
Is this Mr. Lawrence again?

25:04.403 --> 25:06.038
N-No.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.840
No. You just, y...

25:07.874 --> 25:09.375
You just don't get it.

25:09.408 --> 25:10.543
What don't I get?

25:10.577 --> 25:12.378
What you said before...

25:12.411 --> 25:15.582
about feeling weird at some
country club golf course.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.249
Okay?

25:17.283 --> 25:18.885
You felt uncomfortable
at a golf course

25:18.918 --> 25:21.588
and I probably wouldn't have
even been allowed on it.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.396
Kiddo, I am sorry, okay?

25:30.429 --> 25:31.898
That was a stupid thing to say.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.600
I just-- I-I don't...

25:33.633 --> 25:36.502
I don't look at you
and see color.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.105
I see my son.

25:39.138 --> 25:42.408
Then you don't see me, Dad.

25:49.816 --> 25:51.618
Now, remember,

25:51.651 --> 25:56.055
you pull it back in one piece,
slowly... and let it go.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.566
That was a good one.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.036
And you were right
about the grip, too.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.271
-Thank you very much. Thank you.
-All right.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.306
-Book them the honeymoon suite.
-Yeah, no doubt about that.

26:14.340 --> 26:15.775
Carl, why don't you grab
your clubs,

26:15.808 --> 26:17.777
go look for your ball
with Lester.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.479
Randall, hop on in.

26:27.186 --> 26:30.389
Thank you so much
for the meal.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.624
You are more than welcome.

26:31.658 --> 26:33.125
So, um...

26:33.159 --> 26:35.061
what else is there
to do in this town?

26:35.094 --> 26:36.295
And, um,

26:36.328 --> 26:38.064
please don't say
the Zippo factory.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.499
To be honest, there's nothing
really to do here,

26:40.532 --> 26:43.269
except get high and have sex.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.972
And I don't do drugs.

26:48.474 --> 26:51.243
*

26:51.277 --> 26:54.180
I know what you're thinking.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.482
Even the tunnel's getting laid.

26:56.515 --> 26:59.318
*

26:59.351 --> 27:02.321
Is it me?

27:04.957 --> 27:06.959
Are you still attracted to me?

27:06.993 --> 27:08.695
Are you kidding?

27:08.728 --> 27:09.929
I don't know.

27:09.962 --> 27:13.332
You have a whole new body.

27:13.365 --> 27:14.801
-And...
-Kate, really.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.836
I swear, I just have
a lot on my mind.

27:16.869 --> 27:18.971
Okay?

27:22.208 --> 27:24.643
Okay.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.614
It is the pants.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.616
-What?
-What you said to me

27:30.649 --> 27:32.618
about keeping my old pants

27:32.651 --> 27:34.620
in case I put
the weight back on.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.623
Along with the pressure
of knowing

27:37.656 --> 27:39.658
that if I didn't perform,

27:39.692 --> 27:42.461
you would think it was because
I wasn't attracted to you.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.998
Add stress and exhaustion
and...

27:46.032 --> 27:48.567
-Toby...
-Look, why-why-why
did you say it?

27:48.600 --> 27:50.402
You know,
is it because you-you doubt

27:50.436 --> 27:52.839
that I can keep the weight off,
or because you're hoping

27:52.872 --> 27:55.274
that I put the weight back on?

27:56.275 --> 27:57.910
Okay, Tobe.

27:59.445 --> 28:02.214
Let's just go home.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.690
Well, I'm glad I'm driving.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.692
You really put back
those G and Ts.

28:13.726 --> 28:16.328
No. I'm... I'm fine.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.831
Thank you, though,
for the...

28:18.865 --> 28:21.734
drinks and the round.

28:21.768 --> 28:26.472
Jack, you really should
have taken that interview.

28:28.741 --> 28:31.677
I appreciate the gesture,

28:31.710 --> 28:35.681
but I don't need any help, sir.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.384
Look, my father...

28:38.417 --> 28:40.853
was a pipe-fitter.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.955
He worked hard
to put me through college.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.690
And after I graduated,

28:44.723 --> 28:47.960
I wasn't too proud
to take a job as a runner

28:47.994 --> 28:50.362
at a brokerage house.

28:50.396 --> 28:53.099
I rose up the ranks,
met the woman I'd marry.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.934
I bought a house,
raised a family.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.936
Yeah, I...

28:56.969 --> 28:59.371
I joined a nice country club.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.440
And-And this club is where

29:01.473 --> 29:04.710
we are gonna celebrate
Rebecca's wedding.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.446
I see myself

29:07.479 --> 29:10.783
walking her down the aisle
at St. Michael's,

29:10.817 --> 29:13.619
and afterwards,
coming over here,

29:13.652 --> 29:15.721
and raising a toast to her

29:15.754 --> 29:18.724
and her husband
at the reception.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.893
I see it all so clearly.

29:20.927 --> 29:23.762
Question.

29:23.796 --> 29:27.199
Do you see yourself here?

29:33.772 --> 29:37.743
Randall said all that?

29:37.776 --> 29:39.812
Yeah.

29:41.547 --> 29:45.617
Well... he's getting older

29:45.651 --> 29:48.921
- and figuring out his place
in the world..

29:48.955 --> 29:53.292
Hey, did we let him quit
the dojo too easily?

29:53.325 --> 29:55.627
I mean...

29:55.661 --> 29:58.297
were we threatened by it?

29:58.330 --> 30:00.699
No.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.835
It was a long drive.

30:02.869 --> 30:04.837
And he wasn't excited about it.

30:04.871 --> 30:06.772
It just...

30:06.805 --> 30:09.942
-It fizzled out.
-Yeah.

30:09.976 --> 30:12.945
Yeah.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.949
Not a minute too soon.

30:16.983 --> 30:19.718
Thank you, Lisa.

30:19.751 --> 30:21.553
- Okay.
- There you go.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.122
Could have been a lot worse

30:23.155 --> 30:24.523
without the councilman's
lessons.

30:24.556 --> 30:26.725
How'd you grow up
with a white father

30:26.758 --> 30:28.861
and not know how to golf?

30:28.895 --> 30:30.362
Tell me about it.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.198
Hey, how did you guys
find the game?

30:32.231 --> 30:34.300
Well, when I-I said
I wanted to learn,

30:34.333 --> 30:36.335
my father painted
a golf pro's house

30:36.368 --> 30:38.537
for free in exchange
for lessons.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.406
Really? All right.

30:40.439 --> 30:43.375
- Tiger winning at Augusta
in '97.-

30:43.409 --> 30:45.477
Hey, my Aunt Lizzie.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.246
She taught me
to putt like Lee Elder

30:47.279 --> 30:49.515
and cuss like Red Foxx.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.683
Well, thank you, gentlemen,

30:51.717 --> 30:54.553
for dragging my sorry ass
around the course today.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.923
Here is to fathers,
to Tiger,

30:56.956 --> 30:59.391
and to Lester's foul-mouthed
Aunt Lizzie.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.093
Yeah.
- Hear, hear.

31:01.127 --> 31:03.595
If they could see us now.

31:04.964 --> 31:08.267
Listen...
Why don't you find some time

31:08.300 --> 31:11.770
to stop by the office, we'll
talk about your grocery store.

31:11.803 --> 31:13.872
After we talk about
my housing bill.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.741
Yes, sir.

31:15.774 --> 31:17.376
That's a sure shot.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.946
- That wasn't my shot.
- I told you...

31:19.979 --> 31:22.381
-You parked so far away.
-I'm sorry.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.883
My uncle lives right here
so we got to kind of be quiet.

31:24.917 --> 31:26.252
- I'll try.
- Okay.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.454
-But I make no promises.
-You are trouble.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.863
Hey.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.265
Sorry.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.267
Thought you'd be alone.

31:43.635 --> 31:46.638
You didn't have
to send her away.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.540
Sorry I interrupted.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.542
That's all right.

31:50.576 --> 31:54.080
You interviewing mothers
to bear your children?

31:54.113 --> 31:57.816
Really? 'Cause I can catch up
with Donna.

31:57.849 --> 31:59.785
I saw Ryan.

32:00.819 --> 32:02.188
And?

32:03.255 --> 32:05.424
Total fubar.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.394
It started out okay, and then...

32:08.427 --> 32:11.630
he got critical,
and I got defensive,

32:11.663 --> 32:13.932
and then we started arguing,

32:13.966 --> 32:16.035
and I lost my temper.

32:18.204 --> 32:20.172
I'm sorry.

32:21.207 --> 32:23.775
I told you it was a bad idea.

32:23.809 --> 32:26.312
I don't blame Ryan.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.946
I wouldn't want to be

32:27.980 --> 32:29.348
with someone
as screwed up as me.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.817
Hey, come on.

32:31.850 --> 32:34.320
You've seen things.

32:34.353 --> 32:37.356
You-you have seen things
that 99% of us,

32:37.389 --> 32:39.325
we can't even imagine.

32:39.358 --> 32:41.793
And yeah, you made some mistakes

32:41.827 --> 32:45.197
along the way,
but you're trying.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.666
That doesn't make you unlovable.

32:47.699 --> 32:49.001
It makes you human.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.984
I'm sorry.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.961
- Hello? Anybody home?
- No.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.730
They're, um, heading back
from The Grove now with Jack.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.503
I'm gonna unpack.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.172
Okay.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.673
Kate?

33:45.124 --> 33:46.458
Okay.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.461
Do you forgive me?

33:51.963 --> 33:53.932
For what you said

33:53.965 --> 33:57.069
or for cutting up
the wrong pair of pants?

34:00.038 --> 34:02.040
Both?

34:03.742 --> 34:05.711
Baby,

34:05.744 --> 34:07.113
I believe in you.

34:07.146 --> 34:09.547
I always have. I always will.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.016
Yeah?

34:11.049 --> 34:12.284
Yes.

34:12.318 --> 34:14.953
Do you believe me when I say

34:14.985 --> 34:18.157
that you still fuel the furnace
that is my loins?

34:19.225 --> 34:21.627
Well, I could use
some convincing.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.562
My attraction to you...

34:23.594 --> 34:26.132
is purely primal, Kate Pearson.

34:26.165 --> 34:29.868
You are nothing more to me
than a vessel for my feral lust.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.637
And the rest of it,
the emotional stuff,

34:31.670 --> 34:33.871
I cast aside with contempt.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.274
Now,

34:35.306 --> 34:39.610
do you want to take Toby 2.0
for a spin?

34:39.645 --> 34:42.714
I will drive you down
to the rims.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.217
-Safe word?
-Mom and Miguel.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.386
-Weird, but I like it.
-No, they're gonna be back

34:47.418 --> 34:48.820
-in, like, five minutes.
-Good.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.822
That gives us four minutes
to put ourselves back together.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.458
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35:13.779 --> 35:17.149
I'm gonna marry
your daughter, Dave.

35:17.183 --> 35:19.251
I'm... I'm gonna marry her.

35:19.285 --> 35:22.154
I'm gonna get a good job.

35:22.188 --> 35:24.323
Buy a real nice house.

35:24.356 --> 35:26.692
A happy one.

35:27.993 --> 35:29.961
With kids

35:29.995 --> 35:32.030
running around the yard.

35:32.063 --> 35:34.933
So...

35:34.966 --> 35:36.968
let me ask you.

35:39.137 --> 35:42.140
Do you see yourself there?

35:51.016 --> 35:54.186
You're never gonna be
good enough for her, Jack.

35:54.220 --> 35:56.855
Say again?

36:00.058 --> 36:03.028
- Why don't you say that again?
- There he is.

36:03.061 --> 36:05.297
There's the guy
I've been waiting for?

36:05.331 --> 36:07.132
Say it again.

36:08.767 --> 36:11.237
Jack?

36:11.270 --> 36:12.538
Hey, Bec.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.740
I...

36:14.773 --> 36:16.408
- You okay?
- Yeah, no.

36:16.442 --> 36:17.876
- I'm fine.
- It was hot

36:17.909 --> 36:19.845
out there,
and he just had a few too many.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.581
I'm fine. You good? You okay?

36:22.614 --> 36:24.983
- You, you good?
- Hey.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.818
Why don't we get you home?

36:26.852 --> 36:30.055
-Yeah, okay.
-Yeah, I'll take you home.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.602
Jesus, Nick.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.373
You scared the hell out of me.

36:47.406 --> 36:50.276
Why can't you just stay
at your own place?

36:50.309 --> 36:52.544
You have fresh cold cuts.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.179
Yeah. Well, okay.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.747
Well, you know, help yourself.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.148
Of course.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.219
I'm sorry.

37:02.454 --> 37:05.457
We should've taken
that hike today.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.498
-Night.
-Good night, Uncle Nicky.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.845
Wait.

38:00.979 --> 38:03.882
-Mr. Lawrence.
-Randall, my man.

38:07.653 --> 38:10.822
Mr. Lawrence,
can I, talk to you a sec?

38:10.856 --> 38:12.424
Sure.

38:12.458 --> 38:13.992
Go on. I'll be right in.

38:14.025 --> 38:16.127
Okay.

38:16.161 --> 38:18.997
Thank you for taking
a special interest in my son.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.499
He really looks up to you.

38:20.532 --> 38:23.702
Still, he's a...

38:23.735 --> 38:25.471
12-year-old kid,

38:25.504 --> 38:29.174
and if my son is asking
complicated, heavy questions

38:29.207 --> 38:32.010
about his place in this world,

38:32.043 --> 38:34.145
a simple heads-up to his parents
couldn't hurt.

38:34.179 --> 38:35.747
Don't you think?

38:36.815 --> 38:39.017
A heads-up.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.787
Okay. Anything else?

38:41.820 --> 38:43.822
No.

38:46.024 --> 38:49.561
Actually, would...

38:49.595 --> 38:51.697
you and your wife like

38:51.730 --> 38:53.865
to come to the house
this weekend for dinner?

38:55.534 --> 38:57.503
We'd love to.

38:57.536 --> 39:00.372
Great. Saturday at 7:00?

39:08.179 --> 39:10.015
-Hey, nice job, Randall.
-Thanks.

39:10.048 --> 39:11.817
I'll do better next time,
I promise.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.156
Randall, hold on a second.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.758
Stop.

39:24.630 --> 39:27.332
I'm sorry.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.335
All right? I will...

39:30.368 --> 39:34.372
listen better and lecture less.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.075
Okay?

39:44.382 --> 39:47.819
You are gonna be
a very important man, Randall.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.356
And a lot
of important relationships

39:51.389 --> 39:53.091
happen on a golf course.

39:53.124 --> 39:56.628
Me, I... I hit a ceiling.

39:56.662 --> 39:58.363
But for you,

39:58.396 --> 40:01.366
there is only sky.

40:01.399 --> 40:04.870
So don't get caught
on the outside looking in.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.372
Sometimes you'll have
to play up to the competition,

40:07.405 --> 40:09.608
sometimes you'll have
to play down.

40:09.641 --> 40:11.577
But play the game.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.436
Like father, like son.

40:39.471 --> 40:41.106
What you want...

40:41.139 --> 40:44.275
is to have a routine.

40:44.309 --> 40:46.645
First,
you got to line your shot up.

40:50.148 --> 40:52.250
And then you line your feet up

40:52.283 --> 40:54.285
to the target.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.223
-Okay?
-Okay.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.274
Good.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.509
Again.

41:22.748 --> 41:24.182
Again.

41:36.194 --> 41:37.863
Again.

41:56.948 --> 41:59.718
This one's for you, Pop.
