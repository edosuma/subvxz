WEBVTT

00:06.110 --> 00:09.610
Wow, their level's really going up...

00:09.610 --> 00:12.570
That's just what I'd expect to see 
from the Black Sword Knights,

00:12.570 --> 00:13.740
Akihabara's most macho guys.

00:14.060 --> 00:16.620
Well, this is what happens when I get serious.

00:16.910 --> 00:19.440
You really are amazing, Isaac.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.500
You keep making the knights stronger.

00:21.730 --> 00:27.020
Both you and Reserick are 
irreplaceable to Maihama now.

00:27.410 --> 00:31.510
Now that you've complimented us, 
we can work even harder, Lord Iselus.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.830
Right, Isaac?

00:34.790 --> 00:38.240
You're working hard, aren't you, Isaac?

00:39.200 --> 00:43.020
I told you to stop that crap!

02:13.650 --> 02:18.990
About that lunar communication device 
you asked me for yesterday...

02:19.580 --> 02:21.320
It's going to cost that much?

02:21.320 --> 02:22.680
Given its scale, yes.

02:23.030 --> 02:26.750
Even three years of Akihabara's total 
budget wouldn't be enough.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.780
Three years...

02:29.250 --> 02:30.750
I hate to say it,

02:31.040 --> 02:35.760
but even if we complete it, getting it 
to work will be another issue.

02:36.220 --> 02:37.330
All right.

02:37.750 --> 02:41.770
Still, going back to our original world, huh?

02:45.270 --> 02:47.100
It's difficult, isn't it?

02:47.100 --> 02:49.770
What did you tell everyone at the Round Table?

02:50.290 --> 02:52.310
That if we could make contact with the moon,

02:52.310 --> 02:55.780
we might find a hint to getting home.

02:56.640 --> 03:00.780
Of course, I told them that I'm not 
sure going home is possible.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.280
I doubt they'll approve funds now...

03:08.430 --> 03:10.120
Wh-What?

03:10.120 --> 03:13.590
When you're worried, you get 
old man wrinkles right here.

03:14.790 --> 03:16.090
No wrinkles.

03:18.290 --> 03:19.210
Right...

03:19.670 --> 03:25.600
<b>Isaac and Iselus</b>

03:21.920 --> 03:23.600
Isaac and Iselus.

03:26.040 --> 03:31.520
Um, so what Shiroe said earlier was true, right?

03:31.840 --> 03:34.190
A lot is still uncertain,

03:34.190 --> 03:37.610
so he said he didn't want us telling anyone else.

03:37.870 --> 03:40.470
B-But honestly, I don't know to react

03:40.470 --> 03:44.370
to suddenly hearing that I 
might be able to go home.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.880
I...

03:47.100 --> 03:51.370
I want to see my mom and dad,

03:52.130 --> 03:56.160
but I want to stay with Nyanta and everyone else.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.380
I don't want to leave you guys...

03:58.380 --> 03:59.380
Serara...

03:59.850 --> 04:01.270
That's right.

04:01.270 --> 04:04.140
We all got to be such good friends.

04:04.140 --> 04:05.390
What do you think, Minori?

04:06.370 --> 04:10.500
I... I don't really know.

04:14.660 --> 04:15.900
I'm going home.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.420
That's the natural thing, isn't it?

04:20.420 --> 04:23.010
I didn't make any effort to come here.

04:23.010 --> 04:25.290
What? Effort?

04:25.290 --> 04:28.410
We were just caught up in this, right?

04:28.720 --> 04:29.900
Even so...

04:29.900 --> 04:33.380
I like this place, and I want to stay.

04:33.380 --> 04:35.760
But next time, I want to work hard myself,

04:35.760 --> 04:37.420
and make my own place to belong.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.300
Tohya...

04:44.010 --> 04:46.300
I respect that way of thinking.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.230
Rudy...

04:48.960 --> 04:51.300
If you have a home, returning to it is natural.

04:51.830 --> 04:54.340
I've been expecting to say 
goodbye at some point.

04:56.070 --> 04:58.620
I can respect Tohya's desire 
to choose on his own,

04:58.620 --> 05:02.140
rather than it being a chance event 
brought on by outside forces.

05:02.800 --> 05:03.820
Rudy...

05:04.470 --> 05:05.460
But...

05:05.850 --> 05:08.230
Miss Isuzu, if you go home,

05:08.230 --> 05:10.430
you can play music with your father, right?

05:12.040 --> 05:16.920
Yeah, but it isn't that simple for me.

05:19.180 --> 05:21.870
What's the best choice, I wonder.

05:26.090 --> 05:29.570
Doesn't this town seem to be 
turning into Akihabara lately?

05:27.800 --> 05:31.810
<b>Deadlines Are Life     But I Refuse     I Can't Go On</b>

05:27.800 --> 05:31.810
<b>Moe</b>

05:29.570 --> 05:34.300
I guess it means adventurers are influencing 
People of the Land in several ways.

05:31.810 --> 05:35.440
<b>Cosplay House</b>

05:34.300 --> 05:35.440
Yep, yep.

05:36.420 --> 05:37.940
Is that what it is?

05:37.940 --> 05:39.480
It is!

05:39.480 --> 05:41.980
The People of the Land are absorbing 
the adventurers' culture

05:41.980 --> 05:43.470
and developing their own.

05:43.470 --> 05:46.450
My grandfather said that's important.

05:46.690 --> 05:49.590
How long are you going to keep following us?

05:49.590 --> 05:53.700
I want to know a lot about 
adventurers, like my sister.

05:54.230 --> 05:55.710
Please teach me all sorts of things!

05:56.870 --> 06:01.800
Well, it's our job to protect him, Isaac.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.710
Do whatever you want.

06:05.080 --> 06:07.720
He really likes you.

06:08.050 --> 06:09.330
This isn't my style.

06:09.330 --> 06:11.080
What's the problem?

06:11.080 --> 06:14.720
This brings Akihabara and Maihama even closer.

06:14.900 --> 06:18.530
But the situation's changed a bit, I'm told.

06:18.530 --> 06:19.730
What do you mean?

06:20.160 --> 06:21.230
You know...

06:21.230 --> 06:23.340
That lunar communication attempt

06:23.340 --> 06:25.430
they were talking about at the Round Table.

06:26.380 --> 06:29.240
The one that might give us a 
hint about how to go home?

06:29.660 --> 06:33.240
I'm sure that would change 
Yamato's power balance.

06:33.540 --> 06:35.110
I don't care.

06:35.110 --> 06:37.900
All that complicated crap irritates me.

06:37.900 --> 06:40.750
What? You don't want to go home?

06:41.040 --> 06:44.340
I try to think about that stuff 
after it actually happens.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.000
I understand.

06:46.490 --> 06:47.260
Jeez.

06:47.910 --> 06:50.260
That sword's just expensive, not useful.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.300
Reserick, you should have stopped him.

06:53.300 --> 06:56.270
You're better at judging swords 
than I am, aren't you?

06:56.500 --> 06:58.090
Listen...

07:02.000 --> 07:03.500
Here, buy this one.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.660
At my equipment level, I can't master 
an expensive sword like this.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.230
I'm not worthy of it.

07:13.230 --> 07:14.160
Let's go.

07:17.260 --> 07:19.700
I was nice enough to recommend it to him, too.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.670
He knows his own capabilities.

07:22.070 --> 07:25.670
I'd thought he was just a child, 
but maybe I was wrong.

07:26.020 --> 07:27.730
Is that what it is?

07:31.380 --> 07:32.880
Is something wrong?

07:34.290 --> 07:35.230
No.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.010
It's nothing.

07:39.850 --> 07:42.900
How is the training going, Sir Isaac?

07:43.260 --> 07:44.940
Pretty well.

07:45.510 --> 07:47.660
The knights' levels are rising pretty fast.

07:48.230 --> 07:50.150
I'm glad to hear it.

07:50.150 --> 07:53.450
These days, we never know what will happen.

07:53.860 --> 07:58.060
Did you call me here to make small talk, old man?

07:59.440 --> 08:00.960
It's about Iselus.

08:02.820 --> 08:07.870
We will soon be holding a large 
festival to celebrate his birthday.

08:08.580 --> 08:13.470
There, I will announce him 
as the Cowen family heir.

08:13.770 --> 08:15.970
Heir? Him?

08:17.830 --> 08:21.760
But I thought you had a son.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.900
Feinel married into the family.

08:23.900 --> 08:29.220
I have complete faith in him, 
but the people wouldn't accept that.

08:29.820 --> 08:33.050
They want the heir to have Cowen blood.

08:33.660 --> 08:38.240
My daughter Salaria and Feinel have three children.

08:38.790 --> 08:40.670
The eldest daughter Liseltia,

08:40.670 --> 08:44.750
second-oldest daughter Lenessia, 
and Iselus, the youngest child.

08:45.770 --> 08:49.250
Liseltia renounced her right to 
the throne by getting married.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.600
Which leaves Lenessia and Iselus.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.490
That's right.

08:53.490 --> 08:55.240
You have the princess.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.760
I had never truly seen anything.

08:58.610 --> 09:05.320
When I saw Lenessia lose her temper with 
the lords, I realized my own foolishness.

09:06.140 --> 09:10.440
I think she is best suited for another job.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.580
Another job, huh?

09:13.580 --> 09:17.440
Besides, ruling a country is a man's job.

09:17.440 --> 09:20.060
Iselus knows that, I believe.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.960
Figuring out the heir is a pain 
on every world, isn't it?

09:25.320 --> 09:28.500
From now on, no one can be a ruler 
unless he understands adventurers,

09:28.500 --> 09:30.320
and they understand him.

09:31.310 --> 09:32.300
Sir Isaac...

09:32.660 --> 09:35.910
As you can tell, he is still a child.

09:35.910 --> 09:39.470
While you are in Maihama,

09:40.110 --> 09:42.720
will you teach him what we cannot?

09:50.930 --> 09:53.190
That's easy for him to say...

09:54.160 --> 09:57.990
If there are any other problems, let me know.

09:58.770 --> 10:01.350
I'll tell my grandfather without 
making a big deal of it.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.740
Thank you.

10:05.700 --> 10:09.780
I thought, if we expanded 
this canal, we might be able

10:09.780 --> 10:13.890
to bring stuff in from the port more efficiently...

10:17.700 --> 10:20.370
This year's strawberries are delicious, aren't they?

10:30.390 --> 10:31.190
I'm not done yet.

10:38.750 --> 10:40.830
I thought he was just some rich kid.

10:40.830 --> 10:43.900
He's really going to be a ruler, though.

10:44.300 --> 10:46.710
Oh, Lord Iselus?

10:46.990 --> 10:49.330
This is a crucial time, after all.

10:49.640 --> 10:52.810
Things are getting complicated 
with Westelande, as well.

10:52.810 --> 10:53.880
Does that

10:53.880 --> 10:57.340
have anything to do with the fact 
that Minami's planning something?

10:58.090 --> 11:00.260
That's unusually sharp...

11:00.260 --> 11:01.970
For you, Isaac.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.770
I'm kidding.

11:04.770 --> 11:07.960
Well, Minami is working with Westelande.

11:08.410 --> 11:12.110
If they really try to take control of Eastal,

11:12.110 --> 11:14.540
war will be unavoidable.

11:14.890 --> 11:16.110
What do you mean?

11:16.410 --> 11:19.150
In the distant past, it seems

11:19.150 --> 11:22.620
the Westelande Dynasty ruled all of Yamato.

11:23.250 --> 11:26.740
But there was a war that engulfed Yamato.

11:28.140 --> 11:29.790
After the war,

11:29.790 --> 11:31.980
the dynasty was ultimately destroyed.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.970
And the land split into its current state,

11:34.540 --> 11:35.380
<b>Holy Empire 
Westelande</b>

11:34.970 --> 11:37.630
the Holy Empire Westelande and the 
League of Freedom Cities, Eastal.

11:35.380 --> 11:38.120
<b>Holy Empire                                                 League of Freedom Cities, 
Westelande                                                   Eastal</b>

11:38.900 --> 11:40.370
Ever since then,

11:40.370 --> 11:43.640
Westelande's been saying they're 
the true heirs to the dynasty.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.800
Trying to profit on the name 
of a destroyed country?

11:46.800 --> 11:48.360
Talk about annoying.

11:49.530 --> 11:53.050
Those "annoying" things will occur 
whenever many people gather.

11:53.050 --> 11:55.680
Well, with us adventurers involved,

11:55.680 --> 11:59.150
I'd bet the situation now is even more complicated.

11:59.550 --> 12:01.400
You know a lot of stuff.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.470
A merchant survives on information.

12:05.830 --> 12:06.910
And so...

12:07.470 --> 12:08.580
This is a present for you.

12:09.880 --> 12:10.910
What is it?

12:15.250 --> 12:16.690
<i>It's true.</i>

12:17.370 --> 12:19.950
<i>Both the adventurers and 
People of the Land are a pain.</i>

12:21.440 --> 12:25.360
<i>I've always ignored that annoying stuff.</i>

12:30.760 --> 12:32.760
<i>They're a pain, but...</i>

12:41.340 --> 12:43.830
<i>Well, they aren't that bad.</i>

12:56.480 --> 12:57.160
Hey.

12:58.720 --> 12:59.820
Use this one.

13:01.500 --> 13:04.550
You're small, and this one is lighter.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.930
Once you master it, you'll be a better swordsman.

13:08.180 --> 13:11.300
This sword is so expensive, though.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.810
It's your birthday, right?

13:12.810 --> 13:13.530
You can have it.

13:15.050 --> 13:19.940
You really don't understand 
the value of money, Isaac.

13:20.380 --> 13:21.820
If you don't need it, give it back.

13:22.070 --> 13:23.370
That was a joke!

13:23.370 --> 13:25.000
I'm really happy.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.700
Thank you!

13:28.200 --> 13:29.830
Hey, hey...

13:30.270 --> 13:33.330
Aren't we going to the princess's place today?

13:33.570 --> 13:35.920
She has her brother's birthday party,

13:35.920 --> 13:37.430
so she says she's returning to Maihama.

13:37.710 --> 13:39.840
Rieze is with her.

13:40.850 --> 13:44.840
I was going to talk to her about 
forming a new idol unit, too.

13:45.170 --> 13:46.510
A new unit?

13:46.730 --> 13:47.340
Yes!

13:47.990 --> 13:49.660
A galactic idol unit!

13:49.660 --> 13:52.460
And its name is... Tetnessia!

13:52.620 --> 13:54.750
<b>Tetnessia</b>

13:54.920 --> 13:59.110
If we do it together, it'll be a surefire hit 
since we're both so popular already!

13:59.350 --> 14:01.370
I want to do something memorable 
before I go home.

14:01.370 --> 14:03.960
And if we do a first and final 
concert simultaneously,

14:03.960 --> 14:05.390
it'll be twice as good.

14:05.390 --> 14:08.430
And if we show our bare legs on stage, 
it'll be a big hit for sure!

14:08.430 --> 14:13.030
If we end up going home, we'll have to tell Sia.

14:13.900 --> 14:14.760
Yeah.

14:14.760 --> 14:17.280
It will be hard to tell her.

14:22.370 --> 14:23.520
Rieze?

14:24.200 --> 14:27.480
Sorry to make you do this when you're tired.

14:27.480 --> 14:30.400
It must be hard, with all the work you have, right?

14:30.400 --> 14:33.470
What are you talking about? I'm fine.

14:33.740 --> 14:37.940
But normally, this would be a man's job.

14:37.940 --> 14:42.000
Honestly... When is that monster 
in glasses coming back?

14:59.330 --> 15:01.260
From an adventurer's perspective,

15:01.260 --> 15:05.010
this nobles' party must seem 
to make no sense whatsoever.

15:05.390 --> 15:06.740
I wouldn't say that.

15:07.220 --> 15:09.460
We have banquets and stuff.

15:09.460 --> 15:12.470
And some people have big birthday parties.

15:12.840 --> 15:13.970
I see...

15:14.820 --> 15:17.690
Iselus is a smart boy, and he listens.

15:17.690 --> 15:19.480
He understands many things.

15:19.830 --> 15:23.180
But he is still only nine.

15:24.650 --> 15:28.710
Part of me thinks it's too early to make 
him bear such a heavy burden.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.280
What are you talking about?

15:30.960 --> 15:34.280
Until now, you've carried that heavy 
burden yourself, haven't you?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.660
Until your hair turned white.

15:39.300 --> 15:42.600
And Iselus may be a kid, but he's a man.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.790
A man's job is to take responsibility.

15:45.100 --> 15:48.430
The weight of your responsibility 
is equal to the power you possess.

15:48.990 --> 15:52.050
And it means you'll have 
more people to help you.

15:52.370 --> 15:54.550
I hope so.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.730
He'll be fine.

15:57.270 --> 15:59.870
Given the way he talks to me, he'll be fine.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.340
Princess Lenessia...

16:02.340 --> 16:04.370
She's as beautiful as ever.

16:04.370 --> 16:08.570
I'm sorry I'm so late, everyone.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.490
I'm sorry I'm late, Grandfather.

16:13.220 --> 16:15.580
Welcome back, Sister!

16:15.850 --> 16:18.340
Sorry I'm late, Iselus.

16:18.340 --> 16:19.580
Have you been well?

16:19.800 --> 16:20.540
Yes.

16:20.540 --> 16:24.740
I have more adventurer friends, like you do!

16:25.600 --> 16:30.440
Iselus, if you think it's that easy to 
become friends with the adventurers,

16:30.440 --> 16:31.980
you're very wrong.

16:32.280 --> 16:35.770
Some of them are monsters and villains.

16:35.770 --> 16:39.100
You need to be especially careful 
around those with glasses.

16:39.410 --> 16:41.850
Don't worry about that, Sister.

16:42.590 --> 16:44.600
He doesn't have glasses.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.110
I'm glad.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.420
The announcement will be made soon.

16:48.420 --> 16:51.140
Watch me, Sister.

16:51.430 --> 16:52.680
Yes, of course.

17:14.480 --> 17:19.700
Lord Iselus, this is fruit juice from my land.

17:19.700 --> 17:20.770
Try it.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.030
Isaac?

17:33.270 --> 17:38.030
Hey, aren't you supposed to be a little 
more subtle about assassinations?

17:38.350 --> 17:40.540
Wh-What are you talking about?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.540
Is there a problem?

17:48.410 --> 17:51.880
The Roderic lab's special ambush-warning 
earring is as good as they said.

17:52.360 --> 17:55.260
I didn't think it would be useful so soon, though.

17:59.650 --> 18:00.500
What's this?

18:02.240 --> 18:03.730
Don't breathe it in, Iselus.

18:03.730 --> 18:05.670
Don't get in our way, adventurer!

18:06.460 --> 18:08.720
<b>Smoke Bomb

Bad Statuses:

Attack speed drop

18:06.500 --> 18:08.730
We're doing this for Yamato's peace!

18:10.610 --> 18:12.730
Reserick, you handle these guys!

18:20.900 --> 18:22.120
Isaac?

18:22.120 --> 18:23.350
Don't worry.

18:23.350 --> 18:25.320
My legs are just a little numb.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.990
<b>Assassin /Stealth</b>

18:32.250 --> 18:34.550

18:34.550 --> 18:35.880
<i>So those are the—</i>

18:43.550 --> 18:46.260
Get your hands off the kid, damn it!

18:47.230 --> 18:49.330
<i>Sword of Pain Black!</i>

18:50.610 --> 18:51.770
A bind?

18:51.770 --> 18:52.790
No...

18:53.030 --> 18:56.100
You can't take your eyes off me now.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.780
I won't let you lay a finger on Iselus!

18:59.300 --> 19:01.280
I'll take you all on!

19:16.160 --> 19:19.180
Don't talk about peace when 
you're trying to kill a kid!

19:19.920 --> 19:21.280
Morons!

19:22.060 --> 19:23.450
Way to go, Isaac.

19:23.450 --> 19:24.620
That was pretty cool.

19:24.620 --> 19:26.760
Your debuffs are still in effect. I'll heal you.

19:27.150 --> 19:28.170
I'm fine.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.890
I was careful not to inhale a lot of it.

19:30.890 --> 19:33.940
More importantly, their 
levels aren't normal at all.

19:33.940 --> 19:37.690
Maybe they're the People of the 
Land that Minami is leveling...

19:37.690 --> 19:39.220
You saved me.

19:39.220 --> 19:42.010
Once in a while, your information comes in handy.

19:42.010 --> 19:44.940
And the earring I gave you 
also came in handy, right?

19:44.940 --> 19:48.460
How did you hear about assassins from Westelande?

19:49.180 --> 19:52.460
A merchant survives on information.

19:53.810 --> 19:56.960
I thought you were more of a coward.

19:57.240 --> 20:01.470
I thought you were more of a musclehead.

20:02.390 --> 20:03.500
Iselus,

20:04.500 --> 20:05.990
it's okay now.

20:05.990 --> 20:06.930
Yeah.

20:06.930 --> 20:08.310
Don't worry.

20:08.310 --> 20:11.980
I'm going to stay in this world for a while.

20:17.910 --> 20:20.240
Thanks, Isaac.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.150
I see.

20:26.590 --> 20:28.560
Let me know if anything happens.

20:29.020 --> 20:32.050
Keep at it, Karashin.

20:33.410 --> 20:34.590
<i>I knew it.</i>

20:34.590 --> 20:38.370
<i>Our presence is throwing off the balance 
of the People of the Land's society.</i>

20:39.680 --> 20:41.670
Maybe we have to go home.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.770
It's been a long time, Shiroe.

20:47.180 --> 20:49.770
Why are you half-hiding?

20:51.210 --> 20:54.810
My investigations in Susukino 
have finally reached an end.

20:54.810 --> 20:56.520
Though it came later than expected...

20:57.310 --> 20:58.460
I'm sorry for the delay.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.030
Is everyone doing well?

21:00.290 --> 21:01.310
Yes...

21:01.310 --> 21:03.850
They said to tell you hello.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.660
What did you find out about the transport gates?

21:07.120 --> 21:09.930
As I investigated various matters,

21:09.930 --> 21:13.980
I found that the fairy rings are 
related to the moon's phases.

21:13.980 --> 21:18.670
There's also a legend that there 
are Alvish ruins on the moon.

21:19.920 --> 21:23.360
<i>It's possible that the administrator's beacon 
is deciding the destination coordinates.</i>

21:23.920 --> 21:25.930
<i>Just like I thought, the moon's got...</i>

21:27.630 --> 21:29.410
We need to make contact with it.

21:29.410 --> 21:30.440
Contact?

21:30.440 --> 21:30.930
Yes.

21:31.860 --> 21:35.440
We're looking for a way to return the 
adventurers to their old world.

21:35.860 --> 21:39.310
To do that, we must communicate with the moon.

21:40.450 --> 21:43.730
But we don't seem to be able to create 
the communication equipment.

21:44.140 --> 21:45.660
It's difficult.

21:45.660 --> 21:48.540
There's a facility in Shibuya for that, though.

21:48.540 --> 21:49.630
I'm aware.

21:50.230 --> 21:52.250
The remains of the Shibuya TV station,

21:52.250 --> 21:54.370
the one communications facility in Yamato.

21:54.800 --> 21:58.560
I investigated it before, 
but it's nonfunctional, right?

21:59.170 --> 22:03.720
But while I investigated the gates, 
there was a slight signal from it.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.830
Do you suppose it may still be functioning?

22:06.340 --> 22:07.430
A signal?

22:09.420 --> 22:10.440
Hey, villain!

22:10.440 --> 22:11.500
What's going on?

22:11.890 --> 22:13.900
Everyone's collapsing!

22:13.900 --> 22:15.230
What's this about?

22:16.180 --> 22:17.510
What do you mean?

22:17.510 --> 22:18.450
Explain—

22:18.450 --> 22:20.730
Shiroe! Trouble!

22:20.730 --> 22:21.980
The city of Akihabara...

24:05.570 --> 24:08.380
The people fall asleep and will not wake.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.730
At night, a black shadow covers the moon.

24:10.730 --> 24:14.260
The town of Shibuya has become a 
raid zone, filled with monsters.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.930
Is someone preventing them from 
returning to the real world?

24:18.270 --> 24:20.200
Shiroe begins the battle.

24:20.200 --> 24:23.000
But there is an uncertainty within him.

24:23.650 --> 24:25.390
Next time: Sleep of the Eternal Moth.

24:23.650 --> 24:29.940
<b>Sleep of the Eternal Moth</b>

24:25.740 --> 24:27.570
I have friends to run with me.
