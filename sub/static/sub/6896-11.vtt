WEBVTT

00:14.556 --> 00:15.807
Ezra.

00:25.109 --> 00:26.150
Ezra.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.656
Ezra.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.991
Mom? Mom, are you there?

00:34.076 --> 00:35.535
Ezra. We're here.

00:35.619 --> 00:39.414
Dad? Where are you? I can't see you.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.253
Mom? Dad?

00:45.337 --> 00:47.380
We're right here, Ezra.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.848
No, no. We've checked these systems.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.559
There's nothing close
to a viable location for a base.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.103
-Maybe you're just being picky.
-Maybe I have to be.

01:44.188 --> 01:46.022
Kanan! Kanan!

01:46.106 --> 01:48.191
-What is it?
-My parents.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.569
Kanan, I saw my parents.

01:55.032 --> 01:58.659
I had a vision that they're out there,
and I've gotta find them.

01:58.744 --> 02:01.954
Ezra, you know visions inspired
by the Force can be misinterpreted.

02:02.039 --> 02:05.124
Just start at the beginning
and tell us exactly what you saw.

02:05.209 --> 02:09.170
Okay. Some kind
of Imperial prison, I think.

02:09.254 --> 02:12.548
My parents were there, and...
And then there was this loth-cat.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.467
You've never wanted to talk
about your parents.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.803
That was before this vision, Kanan.

02:16.887 --> 02:20.640
It was so real. You have to believe me.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.142
I think it's time to show him.

02:23.227 --> 02:24.685
Show me what?

02:27.064 --> 02:28.523
Remember when Tseebo told you

02:28.607 --> 02:30.483
he knew what happened
to your parents?

02:30.567 --> 02:32.944
Yeah. But I didn't want to hear
what he had to say...

02:33.028 --> 02:35.822
That I'd never see them again.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.241
Why? Do you know where they are?

02:38.325 --> 02:43.496
We know they were taken to
an Imperial prison, one of a thousand.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.958
There are so many. Where do we start?

02:47.042 --> 02:48.668
Tseebo didn't know
exactly where they were,

02:48.752 --> 02:50.711
but he had fragments of information,

02:50.796 --> 02:52.338
which we've been trying
to piece together.

02:52.422 --> 02:53.798
We called in every favor

02:53.882 --> 02:57.218
with every smuggler,
trader and pirate we know.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.096
Even asked Senator Organa
to inquire with his sources,

03:00.180 --> 03:03.182
but we couldn't find them.

03:03.267 --> 03:04.267
I'm sorry.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.394
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

03:06.478 --> 03:10.857
There was nothing to tell.
Your parents were just gone.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.149
Hera.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.443
Thank you.

03:21.785 --> 03:25.121
Garel is a major port
and under our control.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.958
Surely our garrison there
would have spotted rebel activity.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.586
You doubt my word, Admiral?

03:31.670 --> 03:33.170
No, Inquisitor.

03:33.255 --> 03:36.632
I merely look to the day
when you produce results.

03:37.301 --> 03:38.426
And they have.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.470
I have independently confirmed
the Inquisitors' theory.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.098
There is a rebel presence on Garel.

03:45.475 --> 03:49.312
They use multiple spaceports
to hide their ships.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.479
Quite clever.

03:50.564 --> 03:55.192
You respect them, even though
they represent your constant failure?

03:55.277 --> 03:56.527
Perhaps, Inquisitor,

03:56.612 --> 03:59.822
we can achieve together,
what we have not apart.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.658
Admiral, deploy the fleet to Garel.

04:07.623 --> 04:11.167
Mom, Dad, I will find you.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.627
Ezra.

04:18.675 --> 04:19.842
What is that?

04:20.427 --> 04:22.011
It's a list of Imperial prisoners.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.597
The Empire's deleted their names
and images to keep them secret.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.933
-Where'd it come from?
-Commander Sato.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.310
He knows of my interest
in Imperial prisons.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.437
His contact in the Core
intercepted a report,

04:31.521 --> 04:33.606
there was a mass escape last night.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.817
That's why I had the vision.
My parents were a part of this.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.028
-Possibly.
-They were! I know it.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.947
We've got to find them.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.198
How do we find them?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.992
I know an old Jedi trick
that might be able to help.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.037
I can't guarantee this will work.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.415
You have to open your mind to the truth
as the Force presents it.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.210
That can mean
something good or something bad.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.878
Do you understand?

04:56.463 --> 04:58.673
Yes, I understand.

04:58.757 --> 05:01.592
Turn around and focus on the list.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.272
Don't try to see what you want to see.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.024
Let the Force be your guide.

05:17.109 --> 05:21.404
Stay in the moment,
be in this place at this time.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.719
Stop.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.929
Prisoner X-10.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.514
Whoever this is,

05:48.598 --> 05:51.017
they were arrested
on Lothal for treason.

05:51.101 --> 05:53.602
-You might be onto something.
-Maybe.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.937
We have to find out.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.689
Hang on.
They could be anywhere by now.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.108
No, Kanan. Not anywhere.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.526
Lothal.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.778
That's why I keep seeing
the white loth-cat.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.579
Where's my helmet? I need my helmet.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.372
We want you to find your parents, Ezra,

06:13.457 --> 06:15.416
but even if you're right,
you can't go now.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.709
We need a plan.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.254
The entire Imperial sector fleet
has the planet in a blockade.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.173
Not anymore.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.716
Been listening in on Imperial chatter.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.342
Wait. What's up on Lothal?

06:25.427 --> 06:28.137
The Empire's fleet
left Lothal's orbit this morning.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.097
Left Lothal? Where to?

06:30.182 --> 06:32.767
Doesn't matter, okay? This is a sign.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.518
I'm supposed to go.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.645
Where's my stupid helmet?

06:37.189 --> 06:38.481
I know you have to go,

06:38.565 --> 06:40.941
but that doesn't mean
you have to go alone.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.988
We support you. We're family.

06:48.492 --> 06:51.827
Speaking of family,
where are the delinquents?

06:52.287 --> 06:53.913
Back to Lothal?

06:53.997 --> 06:56.415
Well, that sounds like a terrible idea.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.001
Besides, we haven't finished
getting our supplies.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.171
-You can finish later.
-Just get back here now.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.466
Not too fast, Zeb.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.426
We don't want to alert
any Imperial patrols.

07:07.511 --> 07:09.428
Don't worry. Not a bucket head in sight.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.639
ln fact, we haven't seen one
all morning.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.265
Kind of strange, actually.

07:13.350 --> 07:16.560
It's not strange. It's strategy.

07:16.645 --> 07:17.937
What are you talking about?

07:18.021 --> 07:21.273
The Empire always pulls back patrols
before a major strike.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.110
No.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.862
Well, Ezra, if you want
to go back to Lothal,

07:27.364 --> 07:29.240
now would be the time.

07:36.540 --> 07:37.915
Zeb, get back to the ship.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.000
I'll contact Commander Sato. Hurry.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.753
Hera? You copy? Hello?

07:42.838 --> 07:44.630
I wonder what she was trying to say.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.969
I think I know what she was gonna say.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.971
Sabine, see if you can
splice their jamming signal.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.139
We'll need our comm.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.765
-On it.
-You two better get going.

07:54.850 --> 07:58.060
-Not until we get Zeb and Chop.
-Just have us ready to fly.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.571
Zeb, we'll cover you! Head this way!

08:11.158 --> 08:12.491
Go! Go! Go!

08:20.333 --> 08:21.584
Chopper!

08:27.382 --> 08:28.799
Got us in a cross fire!

08:28.884 --> 08:30.092
We have them pinned.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.017
We don't have all day.
We have to get back to Lothal!

08:38.101 --> 08:39.393
Ezra, no!

08:58.205 --> 08:59.705
Well, that's pretty impressive.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.290
Yeah. I taught him.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.627
Well. Hello there.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.545
You are not going to get in my way.

09:06.630 --> 09:11.550
Well, then, my brave, young boy,
come and prove it.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.427
Ezra!

09:25.774 --> 09:28.400
Ezra, I know how important
getting to Lothal is.

09:28.485 --> 09:29.735
No, Kanan.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.695
Actually, you don't know
what this is like.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.239
You're right.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.574
I never knew my parents.

09:36.952 --> 09:39.453
Kanan, I'm sorry.

09:39.537 --> 09:40.996
No. It's okay.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.374
It's too late for me,
but maybe not for you.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.543
It's gonna be too late for all of us
if we don't get back to the Ghost.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.587
All right. Come on.
We'll take the long way around.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.172
Way to have our backs, Chopper.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.885
Sabine, where's my comm?

09:54.970 --> 09:56.720
Almost got it.

09:56.805 --> 09:59.765
Hangar 16 has fallen.
Phoenix Squadron, report!

09:59.849 --> 10:02.268
Ghost to Liberator.
Give me some good news.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.688
We read you, Hera.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.356
lf the fleet's gonna launch,
it's gotta be now.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.942
We are employing
escape plan delta, Captain Syndulla.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.026
Are you ready?

10:19.327 --> 10:20.703
They're back. Let's go.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.301
This is Phoenix Leader.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.845
All ships, angle deflector shields
and follow my lead.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.263
Copy that, Captain Syndulla.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.938
Admiral, several rebel ships
have launched.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.482
Prepare tractor beam.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.946
-Zeb, get on the guns.
-On my way.

10:57.449 --> 11:00.367
Come on, kid. We gotta go.
You too, Chopper.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.110
Target their command ship.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.288
They've slinged us in a tractor beam.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.709
Kanan, I'm going back
for Sato and Rex.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.544
You've got your opening. Take it.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.130
We're not leaving until the fleet is safe.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.051
I appreciate the sentiment,
but I gave you an order.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.469
Now get moving.

12:00.929 --> 12:04.765
And, Ezra, I hope you find
what you're looking for.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.226
Don't worry.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.978
She was looking after everyone
long before you and I came along.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.532
This is not escaping. This is attacking.

12:21.616 --> 12:24.243
-I'm open to suggestions.
-I've got an idea.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.412
But it means getting close
to that Star Destroyer.

12:26.496 --> 12:29.498
We can use the torpedoes
to take out the tractor beam.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.084
-Wait, can we do that?
-We're gonna find out.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.253
Oh, boy.

12:34.337 --> 12:36.380
Sir, a second rebel ship
is attacking our flank.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.631
Let the fighters deal with it.

12:37.715 --> 12:40.384
Keep your focus on
capturing the command ship.

12:42.804 --> 12:43.887
Commander Sato,

12:43.972 --> 12:45.764
we're going to break you free
from the tractor beam.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.767
Phoenix Leader,
I gave you a direct order to retreat.

12:48.852 --> 12:50.769
Just be ready to hit your thrusters.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.528
Almost got it. Almost got it.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.786
Don't got it! Don't got it!

13:07.871 --> 13:08.912
I'll get it.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.003
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

13:22.719 --> 13:24.011
Did we get it?

13:24.554 --> 13:25.637
We got it.

13:28.057 --> 13:31.101
-Commander, we're free.
-Get us out of here, now.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.856
So, are we rendezvousing with the fleet
or heading to Lothal?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.608
We stay with the fleet.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.495
Admiral, Agent Kallus
would like to know the enemy's position.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.830
So would I.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.383
You have to admit,
it's good to see no Star Destroyers

14:03.468 --> 14:05.636
over Lothal, for a change.

14:05.720 --> 14:06.803
Why so quiet?

14:06.888 --> 14:10.766
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.186
You're always there
when I need you most.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.189
Hey. I know what it's like
to lose someone close

14:17.273 --> 14:18.690
and not have anyone.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.276
When I lost my master, I was alone.

14:21.361 --> 14:25.155
Regardless of how this turns out,
I didn't want you to be.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.886
So? Where do we start?

14:47.971 --> 14:49.221
Home.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.937
They burned it to the ground.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.398
I guess the Empire
wanted to send us a message.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.946
But my vision led me
back here to Lothal.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.240
lf my parents aren't here,
where are they?

15:08.324 --> 15:09.491
What happened to them?

15:09.576 --> 15:10.742
Slow down.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.494
The Force is trying
to tell you something.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.037
Listen to it.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.473
The white loth-cat.

15:40.398 --> 15:43.233
Here. Nice loth-cat.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.110
Good loth-cat.

15:45.194 --> 15:49.489
I'm not here to hurt you,
but you know that, don't you?

15:49.574 --> 15:50.907
Who do you belong to?

15:55.371 --> 15:56.622
After it!

15:59.959 --> 16:01.710
And we're chasing loth-cats now.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.053
Fast little fuzzball.

16:28.696 --> 16:29.821
Karabast!

16:36.704 --> 16:37.829
Hey!

16:41.334 --> 16:43.669
Hey, stop! Stop! Wait! Stop!

16:43.753 --> 16:45.253
Will you be more careful?

16:45.338 --> 16:46.880
You know there are still
stormtroopers around.

16:46.964 --> 16:49.257
Don't worry, okay? I can track it.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.842
What? The... The cat?

16:50.927 --> 16:53.470
You've grown powerful if you can track
that loth-cat with the Force.

16:53.554 --> 16:56.306
The Force?
I planted a tracker on it, Kanan.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.433
Of course you did.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.111
The locator stopped
up ahead in the mountains.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.195
This is it.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.204
Something familiar about this.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.498
Hey. Our friend from the market.

17:23.710 --> 17:24.793
Get down!

17:32.593 --> 17:33.593
It's him.

17:33.678 --> 17:37.305
X-10? Hold your fire! We're friends!

17:37.807 --> 17:39.391
Yeah, that'll do it.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.018
That isn't my name, bounty hunter.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.812
I know that's not your name.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.024
-Ezra, no!
-My name is Ezra.

17:48.109 --> 17:49.526
Ezra Bridger.

17:49.610 --> 17:53.071
I don't know you,
but I think you might know my parents.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.157
Ephraim and Mira Bridger.

17:59.662 --> 18:02.539
My name is Ryder Azadi.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.418
You're right. I know your parents.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.426
I can't believe you're here, Ezra.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.554
I wanted to find you,
but I guess you found me first.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.306
I know you, don't I?

18:20.266 --> 18:23.310
You remember?
You were pretty small back then.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.479
I was the Governor of Lothal.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.272
I supported your parents
and the messages

18:27.356 --> 18:29.274
they beamed out against the Empire.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.985
It was part of the reason
I was accused of treason

18:32.069 --> 18:33.445
and sent to prison with them.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.030
I do remember.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.823
Then you know what happened to them.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.075
Yes, I do.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.370
They're dead, aren't they?

18:43.331 --> 18:46.166
I'm sorry, son. They are.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.216
Please tell me what happened.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.219
You know, even imprisoned,

18:57.303 --> 18:59.805
your parents would stand up
for those who couldn't.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.973
Especially after
they heard your message.

19:02.517 --> 19:03.642
Yes. That message.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.477
That message of rebellion
you beamed out

19:05.561 --> 19:06.770
somehow made its way

19:06.854 --> 19:09.314
into the deepest dark
of Imperial prisons.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.233
They were inspired by it, Ezra.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.319
They rallied others
to rise up and break out.

19:14.403 --> 19:18.990
Dozens of us, rebels,
sympathizers are free, thanks to them.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.034
But they didn't make it.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.245
They got separated in the escape.

19:23.329 --> 19:26.915
It was just like them not to leave
until everyone else got out first.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.750
But by then, it was too late.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.838
How? How did they know it was me?

19:32.922 --> 19:34.130
On the transmission?

19:34.215 --> 19:38.218
Your voice, your words, son,
telling Lothal to stand up.

19:38.302 --> 19:39.928
They knew right away.

19:40.513 --> 19:44.224
You know, they used to say it
all the time when I was little.

19:45.268 --> 19:48.478
"If we don't stand up, who will?"

20:29.812 --> 20:32.314
It's beautiful, isn't it, son?

20:32.398 --> 20:35.066
Yeah. So peaceful.

20:35.151 --> 20:38.904
That is all going to change
when the Empire arrives.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.907
But I don't want things to change.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.242
They already have, Ezra.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.662
You have made us so proud.

20:48.372 --> 20:51.082
You are going to need to stay strong.

20:51.167 --> 20:54.169
-Can you do that, son?
-Yes, I can.

20:54.253 --> 20:59.674
Remember, Ezra.
Without hope, we have nothing.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.926
Moons are setting.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.387
Be morning soon.

21:05.306 --> 21:09.935
I saw them, Kanan.
My parents. They were right here.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.771
I can't explain how.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.275
The Jedi teach
that life doesn't cease at death,

21:17.360 --> 21:19.819
but merely changes form in the Force.

21:19.904 --> 21:22.530
Your parents are alive inside you, Ezra.

21:22.823 --> 21:25.617
They will be. Always.
