WEBVTT

02:41.167 --> 02:45.667
Victory over France!
Victory over France!

02:45.667 --> 02:49.209
Western Front surrenders!

03:06.667 --> 03:08.501
Good morning, Judge Fromm.

03:09.501 --> 03:13.501
- There's nothing for you today.
- That is what I call good news.

03:13.501 --> 03:15.876
I wish you a nice day just the same.

03:15.876 --> 03:17.751
Your Honour.

03:28.001 --> 03:30.126
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

03:30.126 --> 03:31.626
So what's the news?

03:31.626 --> 03:35.251
A letter from the military postal service.
Typed.

03:35.251 --> 03:36.542
Who?

03:38.084 --> 03:40.667
Quangels' son.

04:03.501 --> 04:05.584
Herr Quangel.
For you.

04:59.167 --> 05:01.417
Something has happened to the boy?

05:08.542 --> 05:11.042
Those liars!

05:16.167 --> 05:17.834
Anna.

05:17.834 --> 05:22.126
You're to blame. You and your damn war!
You and your damn Fuhrer!

05:37.751 --> 05:41.959
- Anna...
- Please. Leave me alone.

06:53.167 --> 06:55.251
It's me, Eva.

06:55.417 --> 06:57.292
Frau Rosenthal?

07:00.959 --> 07:03.459
Anything from my husband?

07:13.917 --> 07:16.251
- Thank you, Eva.
- What do you need?

07:16.251 --> 07:20.292
I don't need much.
As always.

07:29.126 --> 07:35.667
ALONE IN BERLIN

08:14.667 --> 08:17.667
ARMISTICE SIGNED IN COMPIEGNE

09:10.417 --> 09:14.042
YOU TOO

09:28.001 --> 09:30.167
Frau Quangel.
How much butter do you need?

09:31.167 --> 09:33.292
Half a pound?
Your usual?

09:34.209 --> 09:37.709
You have milk and eggs.
Now, how much butter do you need?

09:39.917 --> 09:43.042
- Oh, come on!
- Hurry up. Come along.

09:49.251 --> 09:52.667
Frau Quangel?
I'll take you home.

10:31.792 --> 10:35.417
HANS QUANGEL
23 JANUARY 1940

11:36.584 --> 11:39.709
THE LIAR

12:10.626 --> 12:13.376
I'll be straight home from work.

12:17.751 --> 12:22.251
Hey, Quangel. What's the hurry?
ls something wrong?

12:23.542 --> 12:27.376
We're going to get rich.
A victory over France.

12:27.709 --> 12:32.042
Know what that means? We're going to be
the richest country in the whole world!

12:40.292 --> 12:44.626
So, in the next few weeks we will have
destroyed England and ended the war.

12:45.042 --> 12:49.292
And since the troops on the front
have been so victorious,

12:49.292 --> 12:53.834
it's time that those of us at home
do our duty as well.

12:53.834 --> 12:56.501
The Fijhrer wants to increase production.

12:56.501 --> 13:00.459
He expects productivity to rise
by thirty percent in three months

13:00.459 --> 13:03.959
and to double that
within the next half a year.

13:03.959 --> 13:06.501
The Fijhrer's wish is our command.

13:07.917 --> 13:11.376
We will now receive any proposals
about how to reach this goal.

13:11.376 --> 13:13.376
- Sieg Heil!
- Sieg Heil!

13:14.959 --> 13:18.959
Workers, does anyone have anything to say?

13:21.376 --> 13:23.626
Yes, Foreman Quangel?

13:24.501 --> 13:29.542
To increase productivity, additional
machines must be installed

13:29.542 --> 13:32.126
and a few shirkers laid off.

13:32.126 --> 13:35.626
What are you talking about?
Who are those shirkers?

13:35.626 --> 13:38.751
Some can't keep up with the work pace.
Others don't want to.

13:39.626 --> 13:45.751
Talking politics, skipping work. Some
men here are good at it. Very good.

13:45.751 --> 13:50.001
How dare you talk like that, Quangel!
You're not in the Party!

13:50.001 --> 13:52.167
How dare you discredit
members of the Party!

13:52.167 --> 13:54.417
Quangel only thinks of himself.

13:54.417 --> 13:58.251
Do you donate anything to the Winter
Relief Fund? And to the Fijhrer?

14:00.292 --> 14:03.042
Germany has taken my only son.

14:04.126 --> 14:07.667
Yesterday, I was informed
he died in combat.

14:07.667 --> 14:09.876
For you. For the Fijhrer.

14:09.876 --> 14:12.584
I ask you, Dolfuss:

14:12.584 --> 14:18.126
What more can a man donate...
than his child?

14:29.626 --> 14:32.959
Anna! Anna, we have visits to make!

14:32.959 --> 14:35.667
The Nazi Women's League
is waiting for you!

14:36.584 --> 14:38.334
Heil Hitler, Anna!
Where were you?

14:38.334 --> 14:39.876
- We're late!
- Now, come on, it's time to go.

14:39.876 --> 14:42.001
- We'll wait downstairs.
- I'll change. I'll change.

14:45.584 --> 14:48.917
So, first that Frau Gerda Kleinschmidt.

14:48.917 --> 14:53.042
Then there's a Frau Else Wernicke
who just lives around the corner, then...

14:53.251 --> 14:55.501
listen to this: Claire Gehrich.

14:55.501 --> 14:57.626
She's the wife
of Obersturmbannfijhrer Gehrich.

14:57.626 --> 15:00.042
You have to be really diplomatic
if you visit her.

15:00.042 --> 15:01.792
- Should I cross her out?
- No, we can't do that.

15:01.792 --> 15:03.417
We all have to do our part.

15:03.417 --> 15:07.751
But... perhaps not today. We have to be
in good shape for someone like that.

15:27.751 --> 15:31.709
- What a nice place.
- What can I do for you?

15:32.417 --> 15:35.167
- Your husband?
- Yes.

15:36.042 --> 15:39.126
Your husband's fighting in Poland,
isn't he, Frau Kleinschmidt?

15:39.126 --> 15:42.459
He's risking his life, day after day,
for his people and his Fatherland

15:42.459 --> 15:45.376
while you are having a good time
in Berlin.

15:45.376 --> 15:52.001
- Aren't you ashamed?
- But, I... but... nobody understands.

15:53.167 --> 15:55.292
I'm so worried for him.

15:56.001 --> 15:58.209
I'm so worried.

16:49.251 --> 16:50.459
Lock it off!

16:51.542 --> 16:53.292
Get back to work.

17:02.126 --> 17:05.041
Don't think this will save you
from the front I'm not going to lie.

17:05.584 --> 17:10.126
I know you did it on purpose.

17:11.501 --> 17:13.541
You understand?

18:35.709 --> 18:39.542
If the doorbell rings,
don't open the door. For anyone.

18:54.917 --> 18:57.209
- Otto?
- I'm writing.

19:00.542 --> 19:04.667
- To who?
- I don't know...

19:06.542 --> 19:08.626
I'm writing cards.

19:09.542 --> 19:12.126
Cards that tell the truth.

19:16.542 --> 19:19.001
People will read these cards.

19:22.209 --> 19:23.917
They will pass them on.

19:29.751 --> 19:35.001
Cards?
You're scribbling cards?

19:35.001 --> 19:37.042
What is that supposed to do?

19:42.251 --> 19:46.042
MOTHER, THE FUHRER MURDERED MY SON...

19:46.876 --> 19:49.751
HE WILL MURDER YOUR SON TOO.
PASS THIS CARD ON.

19:59.709 --> 20:04.667
- Why are you writing like that?
- I'm disguising my handwriting.

20:07.667 --> 20:10.084
Let me do it. Please.

20:33.417 --> 20:35.376
It isn't even locked.

20:36.709 --> 20:40.667
- What if she screams?
- She won't scream.

20:41.876 --> 20:44.084
My stupid wife takes food to her.

20:44.084 --> 20:46.001
The old Jew...

20:46.876 --> 20:50.876
she hauled all her stuff up here
fter they burned her shop.

20:53.042 --> 20:55.417
She's hiding.

21:13.251 --> 21:15.501
Psst! Calm down!

21:23.709 --> 21:26.792
- Papa, upstairs.
- Let's go. Quickly.

21:38.876 --> 21:41.251
What are you doing here?

21:42.251 --> 21:45.209
Barkhausen, what are you doing
in this apartment?

21:46.001 --> 21:47.334
Herr Persicke...

21:48.292 --> 21:50.209
Neighbour, we can share.

21:57.459 --> 21:59.792
It's Frau Rosenthal.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.167
- Please, it's not my fault.
- Out.

22:19.542 --> 22:21.084
Look for the money.

22:29.584 --> 22:34.084
- I'm sorry.
- There is no need to be.

22:34.959 --> 22:39.876
- You can stay with us.
- This is too dangerous for you.

23:39.584 --> 23:42.251
- Judge Fromm?
- Come with me, Madame.

23:42.251 --> 23:45.209
Quickly. They'll be back.

23:50.001 --> 23:52.667
Be quiet. Come in.

24:10.917 --> 24:13.084
My deceased daughter's room.

24:13.084 --> 24:16.917
No one will look for you here.
Try to get used to it.

24:17.709 --> 24:22.376
Go to sleep and tomorrow morning
you will listen exactly to what I say.

24:22.834 --> 24:24.626
Tomorrow.
Good night, Frau Rosenthal.

25:05.126 --> 25:07.542
Is she back in her apartment?

25:30.042 --> 25:34.167
- No.
- I'm coming with you. You can't stop me.

25:34.167 --> 25:35.584
You can't stop me.

25:35.584 --> 25:37.667
They'll hang you.
They hang women, too.

25:37.667 --> 25:39.584
Of course they do.

25:45.376 --> 25:50.626
You only go up to the building.
I go inside. I place the card.

26:47.792 --> 26:49.334
I'll be right back.

28:00.501 --> 28:04.001
I'll be with you in a minute.
This way, sir.

28:05.001 --> 28:06.292
Eighty pfennig, please.

29:05.001 --> 29:07.792
- A schnapps.
- Coffee for me.

29:07.792 --> 29:10.084
No, I'll have a schnapps, too.

29:15.876 --> 29:17.626
So, we begin.

29:23.626 --> 29:25.792
From now on we are alone.

29:34.376 --> 29:36.459
You will not leave this room.

29:36.459 --> 29:40.917
For a certain period of time...
possibly a long time, you are my guest.

29:41.542 --> 29:46.084
But believe me, the moment
you step out of that door...

29:46.084 --> 29:47.917
I will no longer know you.

29:48.792 --> 29:52.209
You know what they called me
in the courtroom, don't you?

29:52.209 --> 29:55.584
No? Cold-blooded Fromm.

29:56.626 --> 30:00.084
I have a mistress whom I obey.

30:01.376 --> 30:03.626
Her name is Justice.

30:06.084 --> 30:12.667
But I want to be in the apartment
when my husband arrives.

30:12.959 --> 30:17.167
He isn't coming back, and you know that,
Frau Rosenthal.

30:18.626 --> 30:20.626
Lock the door. Yes?

30:29.834 --> 30:31.959
Where is this Barkhausen, then?
Where does he live?

30:31.959 --> 30:32.917
It's right here.

30:33.917 --> 30:36.834
Have you heard of that old woman
that disappeared?

30:36.834 --> 30:38.459
I know her.

30:38.459 --> 30:41.167
See what they want. Go on!

30:46.167 --> 30:49.251
- Is the old man at home?
- What's it got to do with you?

30:49.251 --> 30:50.959
A lot.

30:50.959 --> 30:54.334
It's got a lot to do with the police, too,
and with the man at the Party.

30:56.417 --> 30:59.626
That's him, Inspector.
It was him and the other bum,

30:59.626 --> 31:02.876
the husband of the postmistress.
My father and me,

31:02.876 --> 31:05.501
we caught them in that Jewish
woman's apartment, on the fifth floor.

31:05.501 --> 31:08.501
They wanted to clear everything out.
You ought to have it confiscated.

31:08.501 --> 31:11.001
You did it yourself, you creep.
You and your father.

31:11.001 --> 31:13.542
Let's go.
Let's talk to the woman.

31:14.334 --> 31:16.459
She isn't upstairs.

31:32.792 --> 31:35.584
- Herr Fromm...
- For you I am still "Your Honour".

31:35.584 --> 31:40.126
- Who is your commanding officer?
- Escherich. Inspector Escherich.

31:40.126 --> 31:41.876
Police Headquarters,
Prinz Albrecht Strasse.

31:41.876 --> 31:43.626
I know the address.

31:44.626 --> 31:48.459
Get him here.
And then you leave this apartment.

31:49.709 --> 31:52.667
Like hell I will.

31:53.084 --> 31:55.417
So, do you live alone?

31:58.792 --> 32:01.459
You don't mind if I look around, do you?

32:35.917 --> 32:37.501
Good day.

32:58.709 --> 33:02.417
You should have seen it.
Papa got into them, he had them scared.

33:03.334 --> 33:07.126
Then me and my brother went after him and
his buddy and really had them running.

33:07.126 --> 33:10.542
- Baldur?
- My brother's an SS Sturmbannfijhrer.

33:10.542 --> 33:13.376
Is that you?
Baldur Persicke?

33:14.751 --> 33:18.001
You often played in my apartment.

33:18.542 --> 33:22.876
You'd ring the bell,
because I gave you apple cake.

33:25.167 --> 33:29.209
Right?
How big you are now.

33:32.917 --> 33:35.001
And how strong.

33:46.584 --> 33:48.334
Get her out.

33:53.334 --> 33:55.042
- But...
- Just go!

33:55.042 --> 33:57.542
Heil Hitler!

34:01.751 --> 34:03.334
No!

35:47.792 --> 35:49.167
She is dead, Otto.

35:59.459 --> 36:01.167
I saw.

36:18.626 --> 36:22.084
You said you saw how Judge Fromm hid
the old woman at his place, didn't you?

36:22.084 --> 36:24.501
You know what's going on
in this apartment house?

36:24.501 --> 36:28.792
A break-in, unlawful appropriation
of national wealth,

36:28.792 --> 36:32.459
a denunciation of a respectable citizen.
Enough!

36:32.459 --> 36:33.792
Oh, I just...

36:33.792 --> 36:38.251
And a dead woman who was
very much alive a moment ago.

36:38.251 --> 36:40.584
You are not getting out of this one.

36:40.584 --> 36:43.209
You can't do this...
No, you can't.

36:43.209 --> 36:45.459
Oh, yes, he can. But, he won't...

36:45.459 --> 36:47.917
because he's a police counsellor
and not a monster.

36:47.917 --> 36:51.876
I'm sure this gentleman didn't take
anything that doesn't belong to him.

36:51.876 --> 36:54.209
Because he knows exactly
what that would mean.

36:54.209 --> 36:58.417
So, he will do what he does best
when he leaves this place.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.792
He will return to his comfortable
little apartment.

37:00.792 --> 37:02.959
And he will observe
what is going on here.

37:02.959 --> 37:05.959
- Yes, of course, Inspector. I will.
- You can leave now.

37:58.584 --> 38:00.959
Your Honour...
Did something happen?

38:00.959 --> 38:02.667
I mean, has Frau Rosenthal been...

38:02.667 --> 38:04.959
I don't know what you are talking about,
Frau Kluge.

38:04.959 --> 38:07.459
Now, if you'll please excuse me?

39:48.334 --> 39:50.792
- I'll take these five cards, please.
- With stamps?

39:50.792 --> 39:54.376
No. I... I already have stamps.
Thank you.

39:54.917 --> 39:58.459
That makes twenty-five pfennig.
I'll wrap it up for you right away.

40:07.626 --> 40:10.376
I need gloves.
Thin gloves.

40:10.376 --> 40:14.376
Sorry, we don't have any.
You might find some...

40:15.167 --> 40:19.084
- Let me think. Maybe you'll find them...
- No. It... it's fine. Just these.

40:20.209 --> 40:21.876
Thank you.

40:27.001 --> 40:29.042
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

40:29.876 --> 40:31.834
Good bye.

40:55.917 --> 40:58.959
STOP THE WAR MACHINE

41:07.084 --> 41:11.417
Listen... Hitler's shadow falls over
Europe like the devil's shadow.

41:11.417 --> 41:15.292
Pass this card on:
Down with the Hitler regime!

41:15.292 --> 41:18.751
What a scrawl!
Even my daughter writes better than that.

41:18.751 --> 41:20.209
Oh, yes?

41:20.209 --> 41:23.167
If you ask me,
he is an incredibly stupid person.

41:23.167 --> 41:26.459
Someone from the lower classes
who works with their hands.

41:26.459 --> 41:29.459
Perhaps unskilled.
But stupid? No.

41:29.459 --> 41:33.042
Probably someone just letting off steam.
Just a flash in the pan.

41:37.917 --> 41:39.626
There is more?

41:41.251 --> 41:43.251
<i>“Mother.
The fuhrer murdered my son.</i>

41:43.251 --> 41:46.292
Mother.
The Fijhrer will murder your sons, too."

41:47.167 --> 41:49.626
- Where?
- Neue Kiinigstrasse.

41:49.626 --> 41:52.334
Two weeks ago.
Another office building.

41:52.334 --> 41:53.459
Filth!

41:54.667 --> 41:57.084
So what do we do now?
Report it?

41:57.376 --> 42:00.917
If we had more men, it wouldn't be
a problem. We would catch this, er...

42:01.626 --> 42:06.584
How shall we call him?
Hobgoblin... in no time.

42:14.126 --> 42:15.876
I'd investigate everyone in Berlin

42:15.876 --> 42:18.292
who has lost a son within
the last two weeks.

42:18.292 --> 42:21.251
<i>- Why'?
- The fuhrer murdered my son.</i>

42:21.251 --> 42:24.167
- There's only one son.
- And?

42:24.167 --> 42:27.667
We wait. We collect information.
Put it together.

42:27.667 --> 42:31.334
That is ourjob. We are
German professionals. Not amateurs.

42:31.751 --> 42:35.376
What if he goes on doing it,
and no more cards are turned in?

42:35.667 --> 42:37.709
Who knows how long this has been going on.

42:37.709 --> 42:40.626
Think what it would be like to touch one
of these cards in a public place.

42:40.626 --> 42:43.084
To stand there, to read it,

42:43.084 --> 42:46.751
knowing somebody might be watching,
waiting to record your response.

42:46.751 --> 42:48.042
No.

42:48.042 --> 42:52.001
Whatever our Hobgoblin writes,
it's going to end up here with us.

42:52.001 --> 42:56.334
- Let's say... ninety-five percent.
- I say it's less.

42:58.459 --> 43:00.501
It's a bet?

43:05.792 --> 43:07.626
So, we wait.

43:08.042 --> 43:11.417
We wait for our friend to make a mistake.

44:11.126 --> 44:16.334
HITLERISM MEANS THAT MIGHT GOES
BEFORE RIGHT IN THE WORLD

44:33.376 --> 44:37.459
Quangel...

44:48.084 --> 44:49.459
Good morning.

45:03.834 --> 45:06.626
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

45:23.334 --> 45:25.334
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

45:25.334 --> 45:28.584
So, you're from the Nazi Women's League,
my dear Frau...

45:28.584 --> 45:30.917
I'll just have the girl bring me my purse.

45:31.376 --> 45:34.417
I'm not here for a donation,
Frau Gehrich. Definitely not.

45:34.417 --> 45:36.751
So, what exactly can I do for you?

45:36.751 --> 45:40.626
Why aren't you at work? Didn't you read
our arms industry's calls for help?

45:40.626 --> 45:45.084
Look at me. Do I look as
if I'm suited to manual labour?

45:45.584 --> 45:47.417
Have you ever tried?

45:48.417 --> 45:51.376
I'm not about to jeopardise my health.

45:51.709 --> 45:54.042
Anyway, I can always get
a medical certificate.

45:54.042 --> 45:56.792
Of course you can. You can buy one for
20 marks from your personal physician.

45:56.792 --> 45:58.459
But that won't help you in this case.

45:58.459 --> 46:00.209
In this case you'll need a doctor
from a factory

46:00.209 --> 46:03.251
to certify that you are unable to work.
A doctor that we assign to you.

46:03.251 --> 46:06.959
Alright. Assign me a doctor
and you'll see what happens.

46:06.959 --> 46:08.834
You're mocking me and the Women's League?

46:08.834 --> 46:11.584
Making fun of our regulations
and our Fijhrer?

46:11.584 --> 46:13.751
- I warn you.
- And I warn you.

46:13.751 --> 46:17.709
You don't seem to know who I am!
My husband is Obersturnnbamfijhrer!

46:17.709 --> 46:20.292
That makes it even worse,
Frau Obersturmbannfijhrer.

46:21.209 --> 46:27.001
You'll hear from us. Unless you have
any more significant information?

46:27.001 --> 46:31.376
- An ill mother, perhaps?
- Your ID and your name. At once!

46:31.376 --> 46:33.167
I promise you,
there will be consequences...

46:33.167 --> 46:39.542
Here you are. I don't have any calling
cards because I'm just a common worker.

46:41.126 --> 46:42.501
Heil Hitler!

46:54.834 --> 46:56.334
No, I don't understand.

46:56.334 --> 46:59.209
That woman comes under
the Labour Service Duty Law.

46:59.209 --> 47:00.709
And you know that as well as I do.

47:00.709 --> 47:03.417
Frau Gehrich is the wife
of an Obersturmbannfijhrer.

47:03.417 --> 47:04.834
So, I'm sure you understand that...

47:04.834 --> 47:08.959
Well, where does it say that women like
that are exempt from general duties?

47:08.959 --> 47:10.626
Where?
Don't be so obstinate!

47:10.626 --> 47:13.501
She has to look after
her overworked husband.

47:13.501 --> 47:14.876
I do, too!

47:14.876 --> 47:19.417
And from what I saw,
that woman has domestic help.

47:19.417 --> 47:23.042
I didn't do anything wrong.
I acted according to our regulations.

47:23.042 --> 47:26.834
So, are you going to apologise,
Frau Quangel?

47:26.834 --> 47:31.917
- What for?
- Then I will do it, on your behalf.

47:32.376 --> 47:34.876
And you, you take some time off.

47:34.876 --> 47:37.709
Oh, you're throwing me out? Because
I told a woman like that the truth?

47:37.709 --> 47:40.751
- No, it's not...
- No, no. You misunderstood me.

47:40.751 --> 47:46.459
Just take some time off, and rest.
Gather your strength.

47:46.459 --> 47:50.417
- That's important, Anna.
- At a time of mourning.

47:51.709 --> 47:53.251
Alright?

47:56.209 --> 47:57.626
Alright.

48:00.417 --> 48:04.001
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler, Herr Quangel!

48:05.126 --> 48:07.251
And all the best for you, Anna.

48:17.376 --> 48:20.459
Thank God.
No more Women's League.

48:20.459 --> 48:23.917
- Well done.
- How can you be so calm?

48:23.917 --> 48:26.501
I nearly died when I saw the gloves.

48:26.501 --> 48:29.292
Gloves, Anna.
Just gloves.

48:29.292 --> 48:32.292
What are we doing, Otto?
We've lost our son.

48:32.292 --> 48:35.001
Other people have lost...

48:35.001 --> 48:37.251
But they, they don't...

48:39.292 --> 48:45.167
This system, this regime.
Now I feel that we're free.

48:45.459 --> 48:49.251
I mean, freed from all of it.

48:50.626 --> 48:52.876
This is how I feel.

49:14.917 --> 49:19.167
NO PEACE WITH HITLER'S DEVILISH
GOVERNMENT

49:24.501 --> 49:28.126
PASS THE FREE PRESS

49:31.001 --> 49:35.501
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF,
NOT IN HITLER'S GANG

49:39.209 --> 49:42.792
HITLERISM MEANS A WORLD OF VIOLENCE
AND INJUSTICE

49:43.334 --> 49:46.959
IT WILL NEVER BRING PEACE.

49:59.834 --> 50:02.417
Lijderitzstrasse twenty-three.

50:14.959 --> 50:18.376
- Next.
- Amsterdamer strasse twenty-seven.

51:23.626 --> 51:25.084
Hey, Quangel!

51:25.084 --> 51:27.167
Where are you going?
Get into the shelter!

51:27.167 --> 51:31.459
It's a shelter for mothers and children,
boy. So it's not suitable for us.

52:05.334 --> 52:07.876
What are you doing here?
What are you doing?

52:07.876 --> 52:09.917
Stop!
What...

52:11.126 --> 52:14.042
Hey, you! Stop!

52:16.459 --> 52:20.584
Wait! Stop! Stop!

52:23.376 --> 52:25.251
Wait!

52:31.501 --> 52:32.792
Stop!

52:56.626 --> 52:58.959
Hey, you! Wait!

52:59.584 --> 53:01.542
Who are you?

53:02.501 --> 53:05.834
Please, can you help me? I need to find
the shelter for mothers and children.

53:05.834 --> 53:08.251
I've lost my way.
My daughter is waiting for me there.

53:08.251 --> 53:10.667
You must know your way around here.
Please.

53:10.667 --> 53:12.667
Your daughter, you say?
How old is she?

53:12.667 --> 53:15.959
She's only six years old!
Waiting for me at the shelter, she said...

53:15.959 --> 53:18.917
- and now there and I am not.
- Ya, two blocks and you're there.

53:18.917 --> 53:20.376
Yes, calm now, calm down.

53:20.376 --> 53:22.459
The people there will take care of her.

53:22.459 --> 53:26.251
I'm sure she's frightened and crying...
It's two blocks, you say?

53:26.251 --> 53:29.459
Yes, two blocks, and then left.
You can't miss it.

53:52.292 --> 53:56.584
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

53:59.334 --> 54:02.542
Well, Inspector, let's see
what your filthy hack is up to.

54:02.542 --> 54:05.334
I hear he's still scribbling away,
right under your nose, huh?

54:05.334 --> 54:07.417
Heil Hitler, Standartenfijhrer.

54:08.584 --> 54:12.251
He won't give up.
It wasn't to be expected anyway.

54:12.251 --> 54:17.126
Someone who takes one and a half hours
to draw that is persistent.

54:17.126 --> 54:18.667
- Tried it myself.
- Oh, really?

54:18.667 --> 54:22.167
But rest assured: I always find my man.

54:22.167 --> 54:24.167
We run our Operation Hobgoblin...
around the clock.

54:24.167 --> 54:26.751
- Hobgoblin?
- Yes.

54:27.084 --> 54:30.001
- I like that.
- Glad to hear that.

54:31.042 --> 54:35.167
Judging by the distribution, the man lives
somewhere around Alexander Square.

54:35.167 --> 54:37.292
There were no cards here at first.

54:37.292 --> 54:39.001
But now he doesn't want to travel so far

54:39.001 --> 54:41.917
and leaves more and more cards
in his own neighbourhood.

54:42.584 --> 54:45.542
- Heil Hitler, Standartenfijhrer.
- How many?

54:47.084 --> 54:50.709
He also includes the eastern districts...
and downtown.

54:50.709 --> 54:52.542
Here, look.

54:53.542 --> 54:57.709
I asked you a question, Escherich.
How many?

54:57.709 --> 55:00.251
One hundred and twenty-seven,
Standartenfijhrer.

55:00.251 --> 55:04.709
One hundred and twenty-nine, to be exact,
with these two from this morning.

55:04.709 --> 55:07.751
- More than a hundred!
- Yes.

55:08.126 --> 55:10.709
If more than a hundred cards
were turned in here,

55:10.709 --> 55:14.751
doesn't anyone of you wise asses
ever think about how much filth

55:14.751 --> 55:16.792
is still circulating out there?

55:16.792 --> 55:19.626
With due respect,
let's think about human nature.

55:19.626 --> 55:22.334
No one holds onto these scribblings longer
than necessary...

55:22.334 --> 55:26.501
Tell me who's been doing this,
because I will be asked,

55:26.501 --> 55:28.584
and I have to answer.

55:29.501 --> 55:30.876
Now.

55:32.751 --> 55:35.417
"The Heroic battle of Stalingrad."

55:37.376 --> 55:40.084
Someone has to write the truth.

55:40.376 --> 55:42.001
With all these lies.

55:47.834 --> 55:50.167
What do you think happens to our cards?

55:51.042 --> 55:53.292
Why do you want to know?

55:56.084 --> 56:00.709
- I want to know how people react.
- Some people will be afraid, probably.

56:01.126 --> 56:04.501
Afraid that someone may have
watched them pick up the card.

56:05.792 --> 56:09.209
Some will maybe put them back.

56:09.459 --> 56:14.417
Some people will turn them
in to policemen, block wardens...

56:14.959 --> 56:18.251
But our cards will also be read by them...

56:18.251 --> 56:20.292
It's like... with a machine.

56:22.001 --> 56:25.751
A little sand in the gears
will not stop the machine.

56:27.376 --> 56:31.376
But if a person throws a little more sand,
and...

56:31.376 --> 56:35.917
and more the motor begins

56:36.792 --> 56:39.126
to the assembly line stops.

56:40.334 --> 56:45.251
Instutter... my mind I see lots of people
throwing sand in the gears.

56:46.876 --> 56:48.876
You are a romantic, Otto Quangel.

56:51.126 --> 56:54.876
I'm a mechanic.

56:58.042 --> 57:00.334
You are the romantic.

57:00.626 --> 57:04.959
- At least, you used to be.
- What? I used to be?

57:04.959 --> 57:09.792
Still, I saw you first.
Not the other way around.

57:10.459 --> 57:12.376
But you didn't say anything.

57:13.417 --> 57:16.334
You were dancing with Peter Reinke.

57:16.792 --> 57:19.501
And then you went with him
to the chestnut tree.

57:19.501 --> 57:22.126
You with your crown of flowers.

57:22.126 --> 57:25.251
Laughing, as if he was incredibly funny.

57:25.251 --> 57:28.709
Reinke... with his stupid haircut.

57:29.376 --> 57:32.126
He's bald now and a member of the Party.

57:32.126 --> 57:36.917
I would have danced with you, too,
but you didn't ask.

57:38.251 --> 57:40.542
You knew the way I looked at you.

57:41.251 --> 57:43.792
Anyway, I asked you two years later.

57:44.167 --> 57:46.501
Not to dance.

58:17.459 --> 58:19.667
So, you'd like a dance?

58:22.376 --> 58:24.917
No.
Just"

58:45.584 --> 58:49.126
- Is that him? Approximately?
- Yes, pretty much.

58:49.126 --> 58:53.084
His eyes might be a little bit
further apart. It was dark...

58:53.084 --> 58:55.876
Thank you.
You've done the Reich a great service.

58:55.876 --> 58:57.834
Heil Hitler, Inspector.

58:58.792 --> 59:00.834
Fraulein Schaefer.

59:02.167 --> 59:03.792
Have this passed around.

59:43.917 --> 59:47.792
"Pass the information.
Join the free press.

59:47.792 --> 59:53.292
Fear has taken control of you.
Kill it. Kill Hitler."

59:54.751 --> 59:58.542
It's a man who is no longer young, who
lost his only son in the French Campaign.

59:58.542 --> 01:00:00.876
Inexperienced at writing, but intelligent.

01:00:00.876 --> 01:00:03.501
The style has visibly changed
during the course of the year.

01:00:03.501 --> 01:00:05.209
HITLER MURDERER

01:00:05.209 --> 01:00:07.959
In recent months he has used
the title "Free Press".

01:00:08.626 --> 01:00:11.376
He's working in an increasingly
professional way.

01:00:11.376 --> 01:00:14.126
He never leaves fingerprints.
He operates strategically.

01:00:14.126 --> 01:00:17.584
He never chooses
the same street twice in a row.

01:00:17.584 --> 01:00:23.792
He always changes between these
streetcar lines: seven, nine and eleven.

01:00:42.626 --> 01:00:46.042
"Each thought against
the National Socialists

01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:50.042
is like sand in the criminal war machine."

01:00:53.667 --> 01:00:56.501
"Pass on this card.
Free Press!"

01:01:00.251 --> 01:01:02.751
"How many children have to die?

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:07.334
Fear is their only weapon...
Free Press!"

01:01:07.626 --> 01:01:11.084
"Help us to put an end
to the criminal war machine."

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:16.084
Zott.
Again and again the picture of a machine.

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:21.042
Papers?

01:01:23.376 --> 01:01:25.334
Papers.

01:02:50.792 --> 01:02:53.251
Today is the twenty-second.

01:02:57.334 --> 01:02:59.709
- Today.
- Birthday.

01:03:14.376 --> 01:03:15.834
Come.

01:03:38.167 --> 01:03:42.376
Sometimes I feel the danger
as if it were so physical.

01:03:43.501 --> 01:03:47.292
- I actually feel it.
- Please. Don't frighten me.

01:03:49.334 --> 01:03:50.792
No.

01:04:02.126 --> 01:04:04.251
- To Hans.
- Hans.

01:04:15.959 --> 01:04:19.042
No. Inspector Escherich
isn't in his office. Just a moment.

01:04:20.834 --> 01:04:22.334
Operator speaking.

01:04:22.334 --> 01:04:24.417
Incoming call from
the Lothringer Street Section.

01:04:24.417 --> 01:04:27.459
Reported arrest of suspect
in the Hobgoblin case.

01:04:27.459 --> 01:04:28.792
Yes, I'll put you through.

01:04:51.917 --> 01:04:54.542
- Anna!
- Oh, hello, Walter.

01:04:55.001 --> 01:04:56.917
Did he run away? Poor girl.

01:04:56.917 --> 01:05:00.334
No. I just brought him his lunch box.
He left it again.

01:05:00.334 --> 01:05:03.917
Oh, I thought he was ill.
He isn't here.

01:05:32.876 --> 01:05:35.876
Anna! How are you doing? You look great.

01:05:35.876 --> 01:05:38.042
I'm getting married soon!

01:05:58.709 --> 01:06:02.126
- What are you doing here?
- We said we would do this together.

01:06:05.084 --> 01:06:07.209
- Why didn't you go to work?
- Not now.

01:06:21.459 --> 01:06:24.376
Do you know what my day was like?

01:06:25.959 --> 01:06:27.751
No. You don't think of that, do you?

01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:29.417
Finding you're not at work
and then thinking

01:06:29.417 --> 01:06:32.042
you are still inside that building.
You know what that's like for me?

01:06:32.042 --> 01:06:34.751
What is it, Otto? You want to get caught?
Is that what it is?

01:06:43.251 --> 01:06:45.917
- Nothing happened.
- Nothing happened?

01:06:45.917 --> 01:06:48.209
Did you see who they arrested?

01:06:48.209 --> 01:06:51.334
A bum. He probably stole something.
It has nothing to do with us.

01:06:51.334 --> 01:06:55.334
That's the husband of our postmistress!

01:06:55.334 --> 01:06:57.834
What makes you think
it has nothing to do with us?

01:06:57.834 --> 01:06:59.626
They're divorced.

01:07:00.501 --> 01:07:03.792
That doesn't mean anything, damn it!

01:07:03.792 --> 01:07:08.667
I was so afraid for you.
What if it's a... a sign?

01:07:08.667 --> 01:07:12.251
- If it's a warning?
- It isn't.

01:07:14.751 --> 01:07:16.167
Stay calm.

01:07:22.792 --> 01:07:25.251
Remember, when Hans died,

01:07:25.251 --> 01:07:28.626
you said your life wasn't worth a thing?

01:07:31.126 --> 01:07:33.292
You were right.

01:07:33.292 --> 01:07:37.126
That's why we can be free.
Why we don't have to be afraid.

01:07:37.126 --> 01:07:42.459
But your life.
Otto, your life means something to me now.

01:07:42.959 --> 01:07:46.626
Means... Means...
everything to me now.

01:07:50.542 --> 01:07:53.709
We said we'd do this together.

01:07:53.709 --> 01:07:57.126
- We won't stop.
- Aren't you afraid?

01:08:01.501 --> 01:08:03.334
Today I stayed again to watch.

01:08:03.334 --> 01:08:06.792
I need to see what happens
when people read it.

01:08:30.751 --> 01:08:32.667
Come... come.

01:08:39.126 --> 01:08:41.542
My sick certificate had expired.

01:08:41.542 --> 01:08:43.709
That's why I went to see the doctor.

01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:47.792
They'll send me to a camp otherwise.
Please. I swear.

01:08:48.042 --> 01:08:51.792
By the lives of my children.
Please.

01:08:51.792 --> 01:08:54.834
Two sons?
And they're both soldiers, right?

01:08:55.084 --> 01:08:57.834
Both of them. Yes.

01:08:57.834 --> 01:09:01.167
One of them is even in the Waffen-SS.

01:09:01.167 --> 01:09:05.126
- And they're both alive, I hope?
- Yes. Here.

01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:08.376
Our Karl. In Poland.

01:09:13.417 --> 01:09:17.626
Well, that's good news.

01:09:17.626 --> 01:09:19.876
So, the man was caught red handed.
There are witnesses.

01:09:19.876 --> 01:09:23.001
And here... the corpus delicti. It's
obviously the writing of our Hobgoblin.

01:09:23.001 --> 01:09:24.626
Come on, we've got him!

01:09:24.626 --> 01:09:27.376
You know the criminal's profile
as well as I do, Zott.

01:09:27.376 --> 01:09:30.167
We're looking for a mechanic
who lost his only son.

01:09:30.167 --> 01:09:32.751
And then you drag
in this ridiculous character.

01:09:32.751 --> 01:09:36.626
A gambler. Who doesn't even live
near our target area.

01:09:36.626 --> 01:09:39.501
With two children who are very much alive.

01:09:39.876 --> 01:09:42.959
Does that...
Does that mean you believe me, Inspector?

01:09:42.959 --> 01:09:46.584
- Yes. You can go.
- Thank you. God bless you.

01:09:51.917 --> 01:09:52.917
Bravo.

01:09:56.292 --> 01:09:58.084
You did what?

01:09:58.084 --> 01:10:01.667
- You let your Hobbygobby go?
- Hobgoblin, Standartenfijhrer.

01:10:01.667 --> 01:10:04.667
With due respect, you may be my superior,

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:09.167
but as a member of the SS
you are not necessarily a criminalist.

01:10:09.167 --> 01:10:12.751
I'm a policeman.
And I'm asking you to let me do my job,

01:10:12.751 --> 01:10:15.001
just as I have learned
from my experience...

01:10:15.792 --> 01:10:17.501
<i>Experience'?</i>

01:10:19.376 --> 01:10:22.292
I know all about guys like you!
Intellectuals.

01:10:22.292 --> 01:10:25.834
Wise guys!
Don't mess up my floor!

01:10:26.001 --> 01:10:28.417
Swallow your damned blood!

01:10:28.667 --> 01:10:32.084
Up! Up, up, up!

01:10:32.084 --> 01:10:34.584
Come. UP!

01:10:36.542 --> 01:10:37.751
You think you're clever?

01:10:37.751 --> 01:10:41.417
And we're just the guys from the SS
who don't have a clue, right?

01:10:41.417 --> 01:10:44.376
Say it. I want to hear it.
I'm smarter than you guys.

01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:46.001
Say it!

01:10:46.334 --> 01:10:50.042
- Say it! I can't hear you!
- I'm sorry.

01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:55.042
You have two days...

01:10:56.084 --> 01:10:59.084
Two days to eliminate the guy you let go.

01:10:59.084 --> 01:11:01.334
Now get rid of that thing!

01:12:21.417 --> 01:12:25.459
Frau Quangel?
You're Hans's mother, right?

01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:28.251
- Yes.
- Dietrich.

01:12:28.459 --> 01:12:32.626
- I was one of Hans's classmates.
- Dietrich... Of course.

01:12:33.001 --> 01:12:35.834
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

01:12:35.834 --> 01:12:40.292
- Well, I'm... alive.
- I'm glad you've come back.

01:12:42.251 --> 01:12:45.834
- Herr Necker?
- Excuse me, I have to go.

01:12:48.959 --> 01:12:53.459
You know, Frau Quangel, I...
I miss Hans a lot.

01:13:19.917 --> 01:13:22.751
I have nothing to do with Enno anymore.

01:13:24.126 --> 01:13:26.917
He hasn't been my husband for a long time.

01:13:27.626 --> 01:13:29.251
Before God.

01:13:36.376 --> 01:13:38.126
Now...

01:13:38.542 --> 01:13:40.751
where were we?
Ah, yes.

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:45.209
You were about to tell me how to find
that ex-husband of yours.

01:14:08.917 --> 01:14:11.042
So, here you've been hiding?

01:14:13.542 --> 01:14:15.709
I know you've nothing to do
with the cards, Enno.

01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:16.959
That's good news, Inspector...

01:14:16.959 --> 01:14:19.584
But the guys from the SS think it was you.

01:14:20.459 --> 01:14:22.917
And I'm afraid they're in charge now.

01:14:25.542 --> 01:14:27.292
In charge of me, too.

01:14:28.959 --> 01:14:32.126
They will arrest you.
They will interrogate you.

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:34.501
In their own way.

01:14:37.251 --> 01:14:39.709
I'd rather be dead...

01:14:41.584 --> 01:14:43.209
You're right.

01:14:44.251 --> 01:14:46.167
You'd rather be dead.

01:15:06.042 --> 01:15:07.792
It's alright.

01:15:08.209 --> 01:15:09.834
It's better this way.

01:15:12.417 --> 01:15:13.959
No, please, no!

01:15:29.792 --> 01:15:34.667
Suicide?
Good news, Escherich.

01:15:36.292 --> 01:15:38.251
The noose has tightened.

01:15:41.376 --> 01:15:45.792
- No new cards?
- Not yet. No.

01:17:50.876 --> 01:17:53.292
Thanks for taking over for Fritz.

01:18:02.917 --> 01:18:04.459
It's getting closer.

01:18:31.917 --> 01:18:35.501
Foreman Quangel.
A machine is overheating.

01:18:35.501 --> 01:18:37.417
Turn it off!

01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:59.709
Don't you have anything to do?

01:20:13.167 --> 01:20:15.084
Ludwig!

01:20:17.084 --> 01:20:19.459
There's something for you.

01:20:27.834 --> 01:20:31.084
It's quite something!
You'd better take it to the management.

01:20:31.792 --> 01:20:35.959
You're a Party representative.
You have to do it.

01:20:36.584 --> 01:20:38.709
Stick by the rules.

01:20:57.917 --> 01:20:59.209
Yes?

01:21:13.917 --> 01:21:16.667
Everyone on today's shift?
Their names? Addresses?

01:21:16.667 --> 01:21:18.126
Of course.

01:21:18.126 --> 01:21:20.501
Our man must live somewhere between
Christburger,

01:21:20.501 --> 01:21:25.126
- Chodowiecki and Jablonskistrasse.
- No, nobody with that address, Inspector.

01:21:26.917 --> 01:21:29.167
Who is the foreman?
Who knows his men best?

01:21:29.167 --> 01:21:31.292
- That's Fritz Kéimper.
- Get him here at once.

01:21:31.292 --> 01:21:32.626
That's impossible.

01:21:32.626 --> 01:21:35.584
- He injured himself this morning.
- And who replaced him?

01:21:35.584 --> 01:21:38.126
Otto Quangel.
From the other shift.

01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:40.667
His name is not on the list.
I thought it was complete.

01:21:40.667 --> 01:21:43.251
Sorry. He's just helping out today.

01:21:43.251 --> 01:21:46.459
- Of course, he does not know the people.
- Where does he live?

01:21:47.376 --> 01:21:49.542
Otto Quangel?

01:22:05.709 --> 01:22:07.292
Walter, where is Otto?

01:22:48.209 --> 01:22:52.959
- Good morning, Foreman Quangel.
- Morning.

01:22:57.292 --> 01:22:59.626
Please, have a seat.

01:23:18.334 --> 01:23:20.209
Frau Quangel!

01:23:22.334 --> 01:23:24.251
We know you're here!

01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:27.042
Open the door!

01:23:46.459 --> 01:23:48.251
Look at this, Quangel.

01:23:49.292 --> 01:23:51.292
This will surely interest you.

01:23:52.792 --> 01:23:54.792
What do you think that is?

01:24:03.167 --> 01:24:05.251
Don't even make the effort, Quangel.

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:12.042
There are exactly two-hundred
and sixty-seven cards.

01:24:16.542 --> 01:24:18.292
Is that the number you were looking for?

01:24:19.334 --> 01:24:21.209
Think about it, Quangel.

01:24:21.876 --> 01:24:25.626
Every single card was voluntarily
turned in to us. Voluntarily.

01:24:25.626 --> 01:24:27.876
We didn't find any ourselves.

01:24:28.334 --> 01:24:31.292
They couldn't wait to hand them
over to us, all those people.

01:24:32.209 --> 01:24:35.626
Some were arrested.
One committed suicide.

01:24:38.167 --> 01:24:41.709
How could you seriously believe
that you would change anything?

01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:44.626
You, Foreman Quangel.

01:24:46.292 --> 01:24:48.126
- Who killed himself?
- It doesn't matter.

01:24:48.126 --> 01:24:52.751
- A small fish. Insignificant.
- Everyone is significant.

01:24:54.209 --> 01:24:57.501
- It's my fault.
- Oh, there we go.

01:24:57.917 --> 01:25:00.334
Now you have admitted your crime.

01:25:01.667 --> 01:25:05.792
Tell me, Quangel, precisely.
How many cards did you write yourself?

01:25:06.417 --> 01:25:08.376
I mean, altogether.

01:25:09.376 --> 01:25:11.501
Two-hundred and eighty-five.

01:25:13.417 --> 01:25:14.542
Eighteen.

01:25:17.751 --> 01:25:20.042
Eighteen cards weren't turned in.

01:25:23.917 --> 01:25:26.459
By the way. We have Anna.

01:25:28.834 --> 01:25:31.501
Then let her go.
She has nothing to do with it.

01:25:31.501 --> 01:25:35.334
I know you're lying, Quangel.
Your wife dictated what to write.

01:25:35.334 --> 01:25:38.334
Do I look like someone who would
let his wife dictate things to him?

01:25:40.209 --> 01:25:42.667
It was my idea from the beginning.

01:25:42.667 --> 01:25:46.542
I thought it all up.
I carried it out by myself.

01:25:46.542 --> 01:25:49.417
- She confessed.
- Now you're lying.

01:25:50.542 --> 01:25:53.667
She confessed.
She didn't want you to get all the credit.

01:25:59.667 --> 01:26:01.417
I'll sign my confession.

01:26:02.792 --> 01:26:04.626
But, Inspector...

01:26:05.126 --> 01:26:08.667
Anna.
Please... don't...

01:26:12.209 --> 01:26:16.209
It's... It's not necessary.

01:26:28.251 --> 01:26:30.459
Send a recording clerk to my office.

01:27:04.126 --> 01:27:05.959
Escheflch.

01:27:21.042 --> 01:27:23.042
To the Hobgoblin!

01:27:59.959 --> 01:28:01.376
Quangel.

01:29:17.167 --> 01:29:19.876
- Anna.
- Otto.

01:29:39.501 --> 01:29:42.292
- You know what will happen?
- Yes.

01:29:44.084 --> 01:29:46.001
It can't be changed.

01:29:46.626 --> 01:29:48.959
I know, Otto.

01:29:52.334 --> 01:29:53.792
It doesn't matter.

01:29:56.917 --> 01:29:58.376
No.

01:30:16.167 --> 01:30:17.501
All rise!

01:30:27.751 --> 01:30:30.626
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

01:30:49.084 --> 01:30:50.834
Time's up!

01:31:01.334 --> 01:31:03.959
Don't be afraid, my child.

01:31:05.584 --> 01:31:07.376
Don't be afraid.

01:31:17.292 --> 01:31:21.584
Judge Fromm, would you stay with me
a moment?

01:31:21.584 --> 01:31:24.334
I'll close my eyes and pretend it is Otto.

01:32:01.542 --> 01:32:03.042
Time, Quangel.

01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:11.542
Put these on.

01:32:39.042 --> 01:32:44.042
Can I do something for you?
ls there something you need?

01:32:44.501 --> 01:32:46.501
A card and a pen?

01:32:51.376 --> 01:32:53.667
You took her, anyway.

01:34:13.084 --> 01:34:15.626
I read all your cards, Hobgoblin.

01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:19.751
Yours and your wife's.

01:34:21.167 --> 01:34:24.959
I am the only person who read all of them.

01:34:26.667 --> 01:34:29.042
All of them except for eighteen.

01:34:32.251 --> 01:34:34.126
Eighteen cards.

01:35:50.501 --> 01:35:53.792
IN MEMORY OF
OTTO AND ELISE HAMPEL

01:35:53.792 --> 01:35:57.334
