00:33.080 --> 00:34.911
<i>E, E, E, E, E.</i>

00:35.000 --> 00:37.798
<i>Then I would go to, like, a G.
And these are all just power chords.</i>

00:38.040 --> 00:40.416
Hey, how you doing?
You're tuned in to Style Boyz television.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.237
I'm just sparking up.
Style Boyz radio hour.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.193
Sparking up this French fry.
K-F-F-F-R.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.475
I am French Fry Guy.
Hello.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.516
No! French Fry Guy!
I am French Fry Guy.

00:49.600 --> 00:50.600
- Not again!
- Cut!

00:50.680 --> 00:52.477
Yeah!
Style Boyz.

00:52.560 --> 00:53.560
<i>Me likey that</i>

00:53.640 --> 00:56.029
<i>When a genie grants wishes
About girls blowing kisses</i>

00:56.160 --> 00:57.479
<i>And your momma doing dishes</i>

00:57.560 --> 00:58.629
<i>Me likey that</i>

00:58.800 --> 01:00.916
<i>Okay.
Where to start?</i>

01:01.160 --> 01:04.038
Ever since I was born,
I was dope.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.320
<i>Honey.</i>

01:08.160 --> 01:10.674
Oh, my gosh, sweetie!

01:11.720 --> 01:14.473
<i>I loved music,
and as soon as I could,</i>

01:14.560 --> 01:18.473
<i>I started a band with my two best friends,
Owen and Lawrence.</i>

01:18.560 --> 01:20.437
<i>The Style Boyz.</i>

01:20.520 --> 01:21.919
<i>Right away, people noticed us</i>

01:22.000 --> 01:25.276
<i>because our lyrics were beautiful
and insightful, poetic even.</i>

01:25.360 --> 01:27.696
<i>You're a motherfucking,
titty-sucking Two-balled bitch</i>

01:27.720 --> 01:29.915
<i>With a popcorn pussy
And a full-on dick</i>

01:30.000 --> 01:32.434
<i>Style Boyz in the house
And we give a fuck</i>

01:32.520 --> 01:34.875
<i>So whip out your nuts
And shut the fuck up...</i>

01:34.960 --> 01:36.016
<i>The thing about the Style Boyz</i>

01:36.040 --> 01:39.271
is that their chemistry and their
friendship was really authentic.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.936
<i>You know, you could tell that they
were really friends with each other.</i>

01:41.960 --> 01:43.234
They were hot.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.520
<i>Before you knew it,
we signed with a major label</i>

01:45.640 --> 01:48.359
and put out our first single,
<i>Karate Guy.</i>

01:48.440 --> 01:50.112
One, two, three, four.

01:50.200 --> 01:54.113
<i>I like to kick it,
I'm a karate guy</i>

01:54.200 --> 01:56.191
<i>Kiya, kiya</i>

01:56.280 --> 01:57.554
<i>Kiya...</i>

01:57.640 --> 02:00.757
<i>Karate Guy?</i>
Are you kidding me, man?

02:00.840 --> 02:02.956
That song changed my life.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.315
<i>Now I'm in a cowboy hat</i>

02:05.400 --> 02:06.628
<i>Yee-haw, yee-haw</i>

02:06.720 --> 02:08.995
<i>Now I'm in a cowboy hat</i>

02:09.080 --> 02:10.280
<i>Yee-haw, yee-haw</i>

02:10.400 --> 02:12.709
<i>Now I'm in three cowboy hats</i>

02:12.800 --> 02:14.119
<i>Yee-haw</i>

02:14.200 --> 02:16.360
<i>Kid Contact.
He handled the beats and the music.</i>

02:16.400 --> 02:18.231
<i>Kid Brain, you know,
he did all the lyrics.</i>

02:18.320 --> 02:19.856
<i>And then, Conner,
he was the charismatic one.</i>

02:19.880 --> 02:21.757
<i>The one who brought it
all together.</i>

02:21.920 --> 02:25.390
You tell me you didn't see him and say,
"Yo, he's the star."

02:25.480 --> 02:28.119
<i>Things definitely
started to get complicated.</i>

02:28.200 --> 02:30.316
<i>I couldn't help it
if the world chose me.</i>

02:30.400 --> 02:31.400
Take one.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.480
You want me to look here?

02:32.560 --> 02:34.630
Pretty funny, right?

02:34.720 --> 02:37.473
<i>Be original.
Be fearless.</i>

02:37.560 --> 02:40.154
<i>I love my White Butt Jeans.</i>

02:40.240 --> 02:42.879
<i>As my star kept burning brighter,
some stood by me.</i>

02:42.960 --> 02:44.916
<i>Others couldn't take the heat.</i>

02:54.760 --> 02:56.159
<i>We broke up the next day.</i>

02:56.280 --> 02:58.999
<i>I went solo,
and Owen became my DJ.</i>

02:59.080 --> 03:01.389
<i>Lawrence quit
the music biz altogether.</i>

03:01.480 --> 03:04.597
<i>And our DJ, Francis,
moved to Japan to hunt dolphins,</i>

03:04.800 --> 03:06.119
<i>like a dickhead.</i>

03:06.200 --> 03:09.510
<i>But it turned out all of that
was just a blessing in disguise</i>

03:09.600 --> 03:12.751
<i>because it turned me into Conner4Real.</i>

03:12.880 --> 03:16.839
<i>I dropped my first album.
And what can I say? It was a smash.</i>

03:16.920 --> 03:21.118
<i>And I owed it all to my fans,
who I share everything with.</i>

03:21.200 --> 03:22.918
<i>Yo, brushing my teeth.</i>

03:23.000 --> 03:25.150
<i>Yo, I just ate a taco.</i>

03:25.240 --> 03:27.913
<i>It's Conner's Confessions,
hoverboard edition.</i>

03:28.080 --> 03:29.399
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

03:29.520 --> 03:30.520
<i>Dude.</i>

03:30.600 --> 03:32.636
<i>Yo, just got my butt waxed.</i>

03:33.640 --> 03:35.198
<i>That shit hurt.</i>

03:35.280 --> 03:38.397
He's painfully honest with his fans,
probably too honest, really, like...

03:38.480 --> 03:39.515
But they love him for it.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.319
<i>Yo, just jacked it.</i>

03:42.480 --> 03:44.948
<i>Um... Feeling pretty
mellow right now.</i>

03:45.040 --> 03:46.040
<i>Doink de doink.</i>

03:46.160 --> 03:47.878
<i>Doink de doink.</i>

03:47.960 --> 03:50.428
Doink de doink.

03:50.520 --> 03:53.830
I think he's incredible.
He really is the real deal.

03:54.640 --> 03:57.916
<i>My fans and me, we're in love.</i>

03:58.440 --> 04:03.673
<i>My songs are love letters,
and the arena is our bedroom.</i>

04:04.840 --> 04:09.231
The stage...
The stage is where we fuck.

04:14.760 --> 04:15.760
<i>Watch out Watch out...</i>

04:15.840 --> 04:16.875
It's Conner!

04:16.959 --> 04:20.190
<i>Bar none, I am the most humblest</i>

04:20.320 --> 04:23.596
<i>Number one at the top
of the humble list</i>

04:23.680 --> 04:26.752
<i>My apple crumble is by far
The most crumblest</i>

04:26.840 --> 04:30.116
<i>But I act like it tastes bad
out of humbleness</i>

04:30.200 --> 04:33.397
<i>The thing about me
that's so impressive</i>

04:33.480 --> 04:37.029
<i>Is how infrequently
I mention all of my successes</i>

04:37.120 --> 04:40.271
<i>I poo-poo it When girls say
that I should model</i>

04:40.360 --> 04:42.920
<i>My belly's full from all
the pride I swallow</i>

04:44.200 --> 04:46.270
<i>I've got it all
And I'm getting more</i>

04:46.360 --> 04:47.793
<i>Adam Levine's hologram!</i>

04:47.880 --> 04:49.233
<i>But I never fall Beat them all</i>

04:49.320 --> 04:51.629
<i>'Cause you know I'm so humble</i>

04:51.720 --> 04:53.392
<i>So expensive.</i>

04:53.520 --> 04:57.433
<i>I'm so humble I'm so humble</i>

04:57.520 --> 05:01.195
<i>I'm not your normal
definition of a rock star</i>

05:01.320 --> 05:04.392
<i>I don't complain
When my private jet is subpar</i>

05:04.480 --> 05:07.711
<i>Your mom's old But I'll ask
if she's your sister</i>

05:07.800 --> 05:11.156
<i>People say I'm charming
But I beg to differ</i>

05:11.240 --> 05:13.674
<i>I feel more humble
Than Dikembe Mutombo</i>

05:13.760 --> 05:17.309
<i>After a stumble left him
covered In a big pot of gumbo</i>

05:17.400 --> 05:20.551
<i>I guess, in a way,
being gracious Is my weakness</i>

05:20.640 --> 05:24.997
<i>People say I'm so
unpretentious For a genius</i>

05:25.080 --> 05:27.992
<i>I've got it all
And I'm getting more</i>

05:28.080 --> 05:30.230
<i>But I never fall Beat them all</i>

05:30.320 --> 05:32.675
<i>'Cause you know I'm so humble</i>

05:32.760 --> 05:34.040
<i>I say that with no ego.</i>

05:34.240 --> 05:38.313
<i>I'm so humble I'm so humble</i>

05:43.400 --> 05:45.277
<i>Watch out Watch out</i>

05:46.600 --> 05:49.910
<i>I'm So Humble,
I instantly connected with that</i>

05:50.000 --> 05:54.437
because I'm probably
the most humble person that I know.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.616
<i>Yeah, well, it's a pretty
exciting time right now.</i>

06:06.640 --> 06:09.871
Conner's second album,
his second solo album, <i>CONNquest,</i>

06:09.960 --> 06:11.916
<i>is dropping in two weeks.</i>

06:12.000 --> 06:14.070
<i>And then we go
on the world tour.</i>

06:14.160 --> 06:15.195
Harry, get in here, man.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.616
<i>I've been Conner's manager
since back with the Style Boyz.</i>

06:17.640 --> 06:19.915
<i>It used to be the four of us
riding around in a van.</i>

06:20.000 --> 06:23.959
<i>But, uh, with success,
our family had to get a little bit bigger.</i>

06:24.040 --> 06:28.079
Sure, Conner surrounds himself
with people who are agreeable.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.016
<i>- I wouldn't call them yes men.</i>
- Whoo!

06:30.040 --> 06:31.553
- Money!
- Oh!

06:33.680 --> 06:36.752
It went in! It went in!
You a murderer, son!

06:36.840 --> 06:40.196
Well, Conner currently has 32 people
on his personal payroll.

06:40.280 --> 06:43.511
<i>He has a personal assistant,
a party coordinator, an ab trainer,</i>

06:43.600 --> 06:45.716
<i>basketball coach,
an eyebrow specialist,</i>

06:45.840 --> 06:48.195
<i>sneaker jockey,
two umbrella wranglers,</i>

06:48.280 --> 06:52.353
<i>a weed roller, a weed holder,
a turtle sitter for Maximus, scarf caddy...</i>

06:52.480 --> 06:54.136
<i>a guy who punches him
in the nuts</i>

06:54.160 --> 06:56.136
<i>so that he remembers where he came from...</i>
You're right.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.116
A perspective manipulator...

06:59.920 --> 07:02.514
Oh! That's a guy who's, uh,
slightly shorter than Conner

07:02.800 --> 07:06.839
<i>who he pays to stand near him at
events to make him look taller.</i>

07:07.960 --> 07:10.520
<i>You know, back in my
high school days I was in a band.</i>

07:10.600 --> 07:13.512
You may have heard of them,
called Tony! Toni! Tone! Tonee?

07:14.320 --> 07:15.992
<i>We broke up over
creative differences.</i>

07:16.120 --> 07:18.634
<i>Each Tony had an exclamation
point after their name,</i>

07:18.720 --> 07:21.075
<i>and I thought my name
should have a question mark.</i>

07:21.160 --> 07:23.993
So it would be T ony!
Toni! Tone! Tonee?

07:24.360 --> 07:27.079
<i>In hindsight,
it was not my best decision,</i>

07:27.160 --> 07:31.153
but that led me to Conner.
So who's laughing now?

07:31.440 --> 07:34.876
Here you go, buddy.
Ow, dude! You bit me, Max.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.394
This is my best friend Maximus.

07:37.480 --> 07:39.675
My mom gave him to me
when I was nine years old,

07:39.760 --> 07:41.398
like, right after my dad died.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.680
I feel like he's, like, the closest thing
I've ever had

07:43.760 --> 07:45.398
to, like, a little brother
or something.

07:45.640 --> 07:48.791
If I had, like, a mute brother
that was hella scaly.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.110
<i>As a hatchling, the doctors said</i>

07:51.240 --> 07:54.630
<i>that he had been diagnosed
with soggy bones syndrome</i>

07:54.720 --> 07:57.518
<i>and that he was not gonna make
it past, like, six months,</i>

07:57.600 --> 07:59.352
<i>but that was 20 years ago.</i>

07:59.560 --> 08:03.269
You're my best friend.
Don't tell Owen.

08:03.360 --> 08:07.114
Come on up here.
This is Owen's world right here.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.191
This is where
I keep all my gear.

08:09.280 --> 08:14.229
This is one of the earliest synths I
ever got. It's a DX7. This is a classic.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.356
Oh, Conner's show?
No, no. In Conner's show I just use this.

08:20.920 --> 08:26.119
It's a iPod, 60 gigs, so, you know,
I can fit the entire show

08:26.200 --> 08:29.590
and, uh, plus, like, a bunch of dope
audio books, you know.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.796
<i>It was year three at Hogwarts,</i>

08:31.880 --> 08:34.599
<i>and Harry was worried
it would never get any easier.</i>

08:34.919 --> 08:35.919
Harry P.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.437
You know,
a lot of people ask me that.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.192
They say, like,
"Is it weird for you

08:42.280 --> 08:43.837
"to be playing
the background now

08:43.960 --> 08:46.190
"'cause, you know,
you used to be in Style Boyz?"

08:46.280 --> 08:47.776
And I always say,
"No, man, not at all!"

08:47.800 --> 08:51.156
Because I... I could never do what
Conner does, you know?

08:51.600 --> 08:53.576
<i>Look, I'm a perfectionist.</i>

08:53.600 --> 08:58.196
<i>My first album sold four million copies,
so this one has to sell more.</i>

08:58.280 --> 08:59.998
<i>And that's why
I take this so seriously,</i>

09:00.080 --> 09:01.832
<i>you know, and I live
for this music.</i>

09:02.280 --> 09:05.955
And...
It can't go away.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.678
<i>That's why I personally wrote
every song on this record,</i>

09:09.760 --> 09:13.036
<i>and I used over 100 producers
for just 17 tracks,</i>

09:13.120 --> 09:15.395
<i>to guarantee
that they're all hits.</i>

09:15.480 --> 09:17.755
I made a lot of the beats
on the first record,

09:17.840 --> 09:21.150
<i>but on this one Conner said he really
wanted to branch out.</i>

09:21.240 --> 09:23.708
It's good for him
to grow, you know.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.473
And, also, I played him a bunch of
my beats, and he was like, "No."

09:31.880 --> 09:34.394
What's up, y'all?
Got a hot new single coming.

09:34.480 --> 09:36.357
It addresses some social issues

09:36.440 --> 09:38.271
that I think are being ignored,

09:38.360 --> 09:39.759
so keep your eyes
peeled for that.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.274
We're gonna be surprise-releasing it
next Thursday at noon...

09:42.360 --> 09:43.998
Uh...
And that's it.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.120
<i>Discrimination</i>

09:48.200 --> 09:49.758
<i>It ain't right</i>

09:50.840 --> 09:54.116
<i>I'm not gay But if I was,
I would want equal rights</i>

09:54.200 --> 09:57.829
<i>I'm not gay But if I were,
I would marry who I like</i>

09:57.920 --> 09:59.478
<i>It's not fair I'm not gay</i>

09:59.560 --> 10:03.235
<i>That the government has a say
In who can love who, not gay</i>

10:03.320 --> 10:05.197
<i>Or to which god you
can pray I'm not gay</i>

10:05.280 --> 10:08.431
<i>It gets me so angry On behalf of them,
I feel passionate</i>

10:08.520 --> 10:10.988
<i>Not gay So I pray for them,
and I say for them</i>

10:11.080 --> 10:12.593
<i>We need to make a change Not gay</i>

10:12.680 --> 10:15.319
<i>I see it clear as day This area is
not gray, titties</i>

10:15.400 --> 10:17.277
<i>We need equality
And for all to see</i>

10:17.360 --> 10:19.237
<i>That this is the new way Not gay</i>

10:19.320 --> 10:20.833
<i>Just seems, not gay
Wrong, not gay</i>

10:20.920 --> 10:22.478
<i>That no one seems to care Sports</i>

10:22.600 --> 10:24.352
<i>We can't continue to pretend</i>

10:24.440 --> 10:27.079
<i>This not gay madness
has to end Not gay</i>

10:27.160 --> 10:28.957
<i>I was born this way...
Straight...</i>

10:29.040 --> 10:30.712
<i>You were born your way...
Gay...</i>

10:30.800 --> 10:32.518
<i>Gay or straight, Straight or gay</i>

10:32.600 --> 10:34.318
<i>It's all okay...
Sure...</i>

10:34.400 --> 10:36.072
<i>It's time to make a change...
Yes...</i>

10:36.160 --> 10:37.718
<i>Time to stop the hate...
Uh...</i>

10:37.760 --> 10:40.320
<i>'Cause who you are is beautiful...
Not gay...</i>

10:40.400 --> 10:43.710
<i>Lying in bed next to 10
beautiful girls All straight</i>

10:43.800 --> 10:45.518
<i>And while I made
love to every one of them</i>

10:45.600 --> 10:47.511
<i>I was thinking about
the world Hot wings</i>

10:47.600 --> 10:49.238
<i>True love trumps all Predator</i>

10:49.320 --> 10:51.231
<i>Flying kicks, not gay
Big watch, not gay</i>

10:51.320 --> 10:53.959
<i>Missionary, one love Gym socks,
nunchuck, not gay</i>

10:54.040 --> 10:55.519
<i>Lighter fluid,

10:55.600 --> 10:57.136
<i>Four-wheel drive,
gay marriage, love beave</i>

10:57.160 --> 11:00.038
<i>Free love, golf club, two guys,
not gay, rainbow, muff dive</i>

11:00.120 --> 11:01.678
<i>Harvey Milk, Sean Penn, not gay</i>

11:01.760 --> 11:03.193
<i>Drum solo, courtside seats,

11:03.280 --> 11:05.191
<i>One-armed pushups

11:05.280 --> 11:06.633
<i>I'm not gay I'm not gay</i>

11:06.720 --> 11:09.234
<i>I'm not, not, not gay
I'm not gay</i>

11:09.320 --> 11:11.231
<i>I was born this way...
I'm straight...</i>

11:11.320 --> 11:13.117
<i>You were born your way...
You're gay...</i>

11:13.200 --> 11:14.480
<i>Gay or straight, Straight or gay</i>

11:14.560 --> 11:16.816
<i>It's all okay... And now it time
for sexual freedom for all</i>

11:16.840 --> 11:18.496
<i>Time to make a change...
Sexual freedom for all...</i>

11:18.520 --> 11:19.896
<i>Time to stop the hate...
Sexual freedom for all...</i>

11:19.920 --> 11:21.876
<i>'Cause who you are is beautiful</i>

11:21.960 --> 11:23.916
<i>Sexual freedom for all, not gay</i>

11:24.480 --> 11:27.597
He's writing a song
for gay marriage.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.194
You know, like it's not allowed.
It's allowed now.

11:32.120 --> 11:37.353
Usually, I don't like
to read reviews, but I'm just excited.

11:37.440 --> 11:40.876
Like, I can't... I can't wait.
I wanna know how people feel about it,

11:40.960 --> 11:44.794
and I wanna know how much they love it,
so, uh, here we go.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.160
Um...

11:49.320 --> 11:53.632
Well, it's Pitchfork.
It's... They gave it a negative review.

11:55.600 --> 12:01.516
No, like it's a negative four
out of 10. Positive 10, I assume.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.478
<i>Pitchfork</i> can be kind of pretentious,
though, so...

12:05.160 --> 12:06.798
What?

12:07.720 --> 12:09.073
You ain't gonna knock my hustle.

12:09.160 --> 12:12.789
Let's look at another one.
Let's pull it up. <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

12:13.480 --> 12:18.634
Okay, um...
Out of four possible stars,

12:18.720 --> 12:23.191
<i>Rolling Stone</i> has
given it the shit emoji.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.515
I can only assume
it's a mess-up, you know.

12:27.640 --> 12:30.791
They must have had
a problem with their, um...

12:32.160 --> 12:35.709
No, this seems like the right score
for how they're saying this.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.678
You know what?
Let just do a search.

12:38.760 --> 12:41.320
<i>"CONNquest</i> review."

12:41.960 --> 12:44.394
Oh, here we go.
Here we go.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.994
<i>"CONNquest</i> a triumph."

12:49.680 --> 12:54.549
That's a good one. Let me read it.
This is on <i>The Onion.</i>

12:55.360 --> 12:59.558
So, you know, mixed.
Let's call it mixed reviews.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.757
<i>So first you're in a group.
You introduce us to the Style Boyz,</i>

13:03.880 --> 13:06.136
and <i>Donkey Roll,</i> of course,
we play the hell out of that.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.310
Yeah.
That's a hit for us, man.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.176
And then, Conner,
you get that breakout moment.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.270
You get a phone call
from Claudia Cantrell.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.475
The one and only.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.118
And she asks you
for a verse, man,

13:15.200 --> 13:16.713
on her song <i>Turn Up the Beef.</i>

13:16.800 --> 13:20.475
<i>Turn up the Beef</i>

13:20.560 --> 13:23.597
<i>Throw your body on the flame</i>

13:23.680 --> 13:24.908
But you take that moment,

13:25.000 --> 13:26.638
and instead of just,
like, kicking

13:26.720 --> 13:28.416
a regular verse... You know what
I'm saying?

13:28.440 --> 13:30.112
You did something
a little different.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.016
The "catchphrase" verse,
as it's now known. Yeah.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.359
Oh. Yeah, yeah.
Hello.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.856
I had been working on a catchphrase...
Mmm-hmm.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.792
But what had happened was I
just thought of so many dope ones

13:37.920 --> 13:41.708
that I was like,
"What if I put them all into the verse?"

13:42.120 --> 13:43.896
<i>Turn up the beef</i>
CONNER: <i>It's Conner, bitch</i>

13:50.880 --> 13:52.677
Yeah, he said so many words
I didn't know.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.239
<i>That was
a game-changing moment.</i>

13:54.320 --> 13:56.276
<i>Usually one
catchphrase in a hit.</i>

13:56.360 --> 13:58.032
He dropped, like,
30 on us in one night.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.155
Shit was crazy.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.468
<i>Conner4Real</i>

14:10.560 --> 14:14.269
Immediately, I said, "Man, this guy
right here, he's gonna make it big!"

14:14.400 --> 14:16.038
Because when you have
a catchphrase,

14:16.120 --> 14:18.429
the world is catched
by your phrase.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.136
You fast forward.
Things start to happen, man.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.515
You get the Pop Music Award,
and now,

14:22.600 --> 14:24.875
here come those
offers of a solo contract.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.389
Yeah. How'd the other Style Boyz
feel about that?

14:27.520 --> 14:28.960
You know, they took it fine.
Mmm-hmm.

14:29.080 --> 14:32.197
Owen is my DJ and my best friend.
That's good, man.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.840
And Lawrence lives
on a farm now, so...

14:34.920 --> 14:38.071
Hold on. Lawrence Dunn
is a farmer?

14:40.960 --> 14:42.439
My name is Lawrence Dunn.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.318
I used to be in the Style Boyz.
Now I'm a farmer.

14:45.600 --> 14:46.919
<i>Being out here in nature,</i>

14:47.000 --> 14:50.356
<i>away from all the people
and the trappings of modern life,</i>

14:51.240 --> 14:53.629
<i>it's so peaceful.
There nothing like it.</i> Ohh!

14:53.720 --> 14:54.914
I've never been happier.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.634
Uh... So, yeah, this is, uh,
all my woodwork.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.234
It's kind of my passion,
uh, my hobby.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.276
This is a nice piece.
It's called

15:04.360 --> 15:07.909
<i>Government in Crisis</i>
for obvious reasons.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.275
This one's a mask.
It's still me.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.759
It's a hat.

15:11.840 --> 15:15.435
<i>You know, we were going places as a band.
We had plans as a band.</i>

15:15.560 --> 15:19.838
<i>Style Boyz, that's three guys, not two.
It doesn't work with two.</i>

15:19.920 --> 15:21.433
You know, it's like a tricycle.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.520
You take away one of the wheels,
what have you got?

15:23.600 --> 15:26.876
Nothing. A bicycle.
Don't use that.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.430
Look, we had a good run, you know.
We had a few hits.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.750
<i>But it had run its course,
you know.</i>

15:32.840 --> 15:34.990
It was time
for us to all move on.

15:35.120 --> 15:36.439
Get over it.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.511
When the Style Boyz broke up...

15:39.440 --> 15:40.475
Damn.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.590
The only other time
I remember being that sad

15:44.680 --> 15:48.389
was when they killed Josh
Charles on The Good Wife.

15:48.520 --> 15:53.355
<i>I'm a Style Boy for life</i>

16:02.680 --> 16:04.477
Y'all ready for this?
Yeah.

16:04.560 --> 16:08.030
Okay. Welcome to the future, bitches.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.958
That's Conner's song.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.639
Whoa!

16:16.400 --> 16:17.753
Okay, both sides.
Okay.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.149
- It's fun, right?
- Yeah.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.310
You know, it's my favorite.
I like the freezer one.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.631
Listen to this, homies.
We can upload your entire album

16:25.720 --> 16:27.995
to fridges, washer-dryers,
blenders,

16:28.080 --> 16:29.718
and microwaves
across the country.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.957
You could do that?
Yes, nerd.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.318
It's just Wi-Fi jibber jabber.
It's not a big deal.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.992
Nobody doing appliance shit,
my nigga.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.376
Ain't that right, my nigger?
No one is doing appliance shit.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.800
Okay,
went with the hard "r."

16:40.880 --> 16:42.836
This is that next,
next, next, man.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.956
I told you all,
Deborah's a genius.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.634
It's true, and it is
also pronounced "Deboarrah."

16:48.040 --> 16:50.508
- "Deboarrah." Oh, that's very cool.
- "Deboarrah."

16:50.600 --> 16:51.919
What's the origin of that?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.991
Uh, I believe Deborah.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.433
That was ridiculous.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.869
Right? Oh, my God, yes,
that was insane.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.880
I mean, who would wanna listen
to music that way?

16:59.920 --> 17:01.876
- Swag.
- I know it's kind of weird,

17:01.960 --> 17:04.473
but Aquaspin's gonna help us
get the music out there, man.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.736
I mean... You don't think people are
gonna have a problem

17:06.760 --> 17:08.557
when music just
appears in their houses?

17:08.720 --> 17:10.119
Look, I know it sounds lame,

17:10.200 --> 17:12.953
but there's no such thing
as selling out anymore, man.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.837
This is how big business works.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.797
I mean, nowadays,
if you don't sell out,

17:16.880 --> 17:18.950
people will wonder
if nobody asked you to.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.075
Right.
But look, dude,

17:20.160 --> 17:22.435
if you're not comfortable with it,
we could rethink it.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.073
No, man, it's cool.
It's cool.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.640
All right, cool.
Let's get in the car.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.296
This jacket's making
me sweat my ass off.

17:27.319 --> 17:28.992
Yeah, it's fucking hot
as shit out here.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.936
<i>- Welcome to the car, Conner.</i>
- AC.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.757
<i>- Did you say Macy's?</i>
- AC.

17:32.840 --> 17:33.955
<i>Did you say Macy's?</i>

17:34.080 --> 17:35.496
<i>- Macy's? Macy's?</i>
- Air conditioning.

17:35.520 --> 17:39.195
Sometimes Conner just gets an idea,
and he runs with it, you know,

17:39.280 --> 17:43.796
<i>and he's right, like,
99.9% of the time,</i>

17:43.880 --> 17:46.474
so you've just got to trust
that he knows what he's doing.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.632
So I understand why he, you know,
did the whole Aquaspin thing.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.917
Touring is expensive today.
Why you think I do the A$ap Crunchables?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.976
This is Gary Sikes.
This is the label photographer.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.389
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
All right. There we go. Yeah.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.436
All right. Got the two of you.
Great. Okay.

18:04.560 --> 18:05.856
Can I have a little
separation, please?

18:05.880 --> 18:07.074
Oh wait.
Hang on, Gary.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.696
You're not trying to break up the
dream team, are you?

18:08.720 --> 18:09.976
No, no, no.
Just trying to get the logo.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.216
May I... May I touch you?
Yeah, yeah.

18:11.240 --> 18:13.136
Just slide down just a little bit.
Schooch you down like that.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.256
A little pressure.
There we go.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.496
I still see your shadow a little
bit on him. If you don't mind...

18:16.520 --> 18:17.816
- Okay...
- You're still in it. You're still in it.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.239
Conner. Nice.
Yeah, same thing.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.435
Nice. Yeah.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.751
Here you go, Paula.
Thank you.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.637
Hey, how's the Pop Music
Award thing coming?

18:27.720 --> 18:29.736
Good. I've called producers.
I'm waiting to hear back.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.433
Please stay on them because you
know how important it is to him.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.431
<i>I'd love to get
Conner to the point where</i>

18:34.520 --> 18:36.431
people forget
that he's a musician.

18:36.520 --> 18:40.115
Where he's just kind of
everywhere like oxygen or gravity

18:40.200 --> 18:43.875
or clinical depression.
He's just everywhere.

18:44.320 --> 18:45.673
Conner!

18:45.960 --> 18:47.712
Hey!

18:47.800 --> 18:48.949
Oh!

18:54.120 --> 18:57.669
Ashley Wednesday, star of the
blockbuster <i>Cube Theorem</i> franchise,

18:57.760 --> 19:00.399
was spotted with
pop rapper Conner4Real,

19:00.480 --> 19:03.552
leaving the exclusive
New York City nightclub... last night.

19:03.640 --> 19:07.713
Okay. Let's go, kids.
Time to go home in your fun car.

19:07.800 --> 19:11.634
Ash and I have been hanging
out for about six months now,

19:11.720 --> 19:14.473
and I've got to say,
she's the total package.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.476
Well, when I was little,
I would spend hours

19:19.560 --> 19:21.471
looking at famous
couples in magazines.

19:21.560 --> 19:25.109
<i>Us Weekly, People,</i>
and everybody's speculating.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.670
"Are they a real couple,
or are they just for publicity?"

19:28.760 --> 19:31.320
And I knew that when I grew up,

19:31.440 --> 19:33.112
I wanted to be one
of those couples.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.357
Five, four, three,

19:37.440 --> 19:39.271
two, one!

19:50.480 --> 19:52.176
<i>Last night, popstar Conner4Real's</i>

19:52.200 --> 19:54.555
<i>new album</i> CONNquest
<i>was released...</i>

19:54.640 --> 19:55.696
<i>on all Aquaspin appliances.</i>

19:55.720 --> 19:57.896
<i>Millions of unsuspecting
Americans turned on their toasters...</i>

19:57.920 --> 19:59.319
You can't do that to people.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.038
Yo, Conner4Real, you suck, dude!

20:01.120 --> 20:02.439
Whoo!

20:02.520 --> 20:05.318
<i>The President calling
the popstar a real dumb...</i>

20:05.400 --> 20:07.755
<i>The only reason
he put it in appliances</i>

20:07.840 --> 20:10.354
<i>is 'cause no one was gonna
buy his shit album.</i>

20:14.840 --> 20:18.037
He released his record
with a dishwashing company?

20:18.120 --> 20:20.096
They did this big launch,
and it was all wireless or something.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.873
I don't know. But it came out of every
appliance in my house,

20:22.960 --> 20:25.599
and I was just like,
"I hate Conner4Real."

20:25.800 --> 20:26.800
For real.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.234
But seriously,
let's be nice to Conner4Real

20:31.320 --> 20:32.639
'cause he seems like a good guy.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.639
Uh, I don't think so.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.234
Uh, I don't think so.
Uh, I don't think so.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.160
Come on!

20:56.080 --> 20:58.640
Well, the overnight numbers
were not what we were expecting.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.393
They were pretty low.
But it's still early.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.235
Yeah, some people are saying
that the Aquaspin thing

21:04.320 --> 21:05.753
was an invasion of privacy,

21:05.840 --> 21:07.717
so it's just a little
bump in the road.

21:09.320 --> 21:10.548
Um...

21:10.640 --> 21:12.198
He's dealing with it.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.191
Conner, you okay, buddy?

21:20.360 --> 21:22.954
Maybe the numbers
were wrong, you know.

21:23.040 --> 21:27.113
Like, Bonkohub had
a computer virus or something.

21:27.680 --> 21:31.116
You know, you could be right.
I'll have Jay look into it.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.556
So what are we talking?
Like, 150, 200, or...

21:34.800 --> 21:37.439
Mmm...
Sixty-five thousand.

21:37.520 --> 21:42.958
Well, that is not where we wanted to be,
but not bad for the day.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.991
Actually, Conner,
that's for the week.

21:46.800 --> 21:47.835
Estimated.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.240
Sixty-five?

21:51.080 --> 21:52.433
For the week?

21:53.400 --> 21:55.152
Can... Can you...

21:55.240 --> 21:57.390
Hey, can you guys give
us a second here?

21:57.480 --> 21:58.480
Thank you.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.158
It's the first day
of tour, baby!

22:54.240 --> 22:55.355
Whoo!

22:55.440 --> 22:58.955
<i>I know Conner's bumming right now,
but his concert is amazing.</i>

22:59.040 --> 23:01.315
<i>When this thing
goes off and he's out there,</i>

23:01.440 --> 23:03.635
<i>I mean, it's just a spectacle.
It's enormous.</i>

23:04.160 --> 23:07.516
<i>Yeah, my name is Zippy.
I'm the guitar tech on the tour.</i>

23:08.480 --> 23:12.234
Shit. Shit.

23:12.320 --> 23:14.595
<i>I make sure all the
instruments are tip-top.</i>

23:14.680 --> 23:17.136
I love the road. You know,
this is kind of a perfect job for me,

23:17.160 --> 23:20.436
but my favorite free time
thing is flat-lining.

23:20.520 --> 23:21.736
Heart rate dropping.

23:21.760 --> 23:25.912
Flatlining is when you technically
lower your heart rate until, um...

23:26.000 --> 23:27.274
Well, you're dead.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.096
- He's still dropping.
<i>- Then you can catch a glimpse</i>

23:29.120 --> 23:33.432
of the afterlife. Got the idea
from the film <i>Flatliners,</i>

23:33.520 --> 23:36.193
<i>Joel Schumacher film
shot by Jan de Bont.</i>

23:36.280 --> 23:40.193
You know, I try to fit in a
F-line sesh at least once a week.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.919
Two, one.
Hit him. Clear!

23:43.160 --> 23:44.434
Oh, whoa!

23:44.520 --> 23:45.748
Did I shit my pants?

23:45.840 --> 23:46.989
Not this time.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.433
To Conner!

23:48.520 --> 23:49.794
To Conner!

23:53.920 --> 23:55.433
<i>My mom means well.</i>

23:55.520 --> 23:58.159
<i>She had her own dreams of
becoming a star back in the day,</i>

23:58.240 --> 23:59.753
and she gave it up to have me,

23:59.840 --> 24:01.856
so I really owe her for that,
and I'm lucky to have her support.

24:01.880 --> 24:03.552
You wanna go first?
I'll go first.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.198
Okay, you go first.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.709
Kids first, and then moms.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.350
Oh, my God, that is so fun!

24:11.320 --> 24:17.475
Hello, my name is Tyrus Quash, and I
do the food service on Conner's tours.

24:17.640 --> 24:20.074
So these are carrots
eight different ways.

24:20.160 --> 24:24.836
You have your triangles, shaved,
obelisks, natural, julienne...

24:24.920 --> 24:26.399
As the French like to call it...

24:26.480 --> 24:28.736
"Julienne." I think that's how they say it.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.228
<i>Conner's very specific
when it comes to food,</i>

24:31.720 --> 24:36.316
<i>and it brings me great joy to see
him love the treats that I prepare.</i>

24:37.880 --> 24:39.632
Yeah! Connor!

25:00.080 --> 25:02.753
<i>Finest girl I
ever met In my whole life</i>

25:02.840 --> 25:05.195
<i>Wanna take her home
Make her my wife</i>

25:05.280 --> 25:07.919
<i>Knew she was a freak
When she started talking</i>

25:08.000 --> 25:10.594
<i>She said, "Fuck me
Like we fucked bin Laden"</i>

25:10.680 --> 25:13.990
<i>Whoa That girl was a freak</i>

25:14.080 --> 25:17.755
<i>She said she wanted me to fuck
her Harder than the military</i>

25:17.840 --> 25:19.353
<i>Fucked bin Laden</i>

25:20.400 --> 25:24.234
<i>Fucked bin Laden
Fucked bin Laden</i>

25:24.440 --> 25:27.557
<i>She wanted to fuck me
Harder than the US government</i>

25:27.640 --> 25:29.312
<i>Fucked bin Laden</i>

25:29.400 --> 25:30.992
<i>She was a freaky kind of girl</i>

25:31.080 --> 25:33.992
<i>Kept up on current events
From all around the world</i>

25:34.080 --> 25:35.752
<i>More specifically one event</i>

25:35.840 --> 25:38.035
<i>The time Osama bin Laden
Got shot in the head</i>

25:38.120 --> 25:40.918
<i>She said, "Do me like that"
But I couldn't track the metaphor</i>

25:41.000 --> 25:43.434
<i>That said, I can see you
horny Like a Stegosaur</i>

25:43.560 --> 25:45.710
<i>That said, again,
your request Is so irregular</i>

25:45.800 --> 25:48.553
<i>She put on a beard I started
looking at the exit door</i>

25:48.640 --> 25:50.471
<i>Then a turban, then a tunic</i>

25:50.560 --> 25:52.869
<i>She said, "Invade my cave
With your special unit"</i>

25:52.960 --> 25:55.349
<i>I said, "He wasn't in a cave"
But there was no stopping</i>

25:55.440 --> 25:56.840
<i>She demanded
that I fuck her like we</i>

25:56.880 --> 25:58.199
<i>Fucked bin Laden</i>

25:59.160 --> 26:02.948
<i>Fucked bin Laden
Fucked bin Laden</i>

26:03.080 --> 26:06.516
<i>She wanted to fuck me
Harder than the US government</i>

26:06.600 --> 26:07.999
<i>Fucked bin Laden</i>

26:08.480 --> 26:12.268
<i>This girl requested intercourse
To bring her to climax</i>

26:12.360 --> 26:15.989
<i>With the clinical efficiency
Of the assassination</i>

26:16.080 --> 26:17.752
<i>Of bin Laden</i>

26:17.840 --> 26:20.195
<i>You're harboring a fugitive
That ass</i>

26:20.280 --> 26:22.589
<i>And my justice will be
punitive Imma smash</i>

26:22.680 --> 26:24.557
<i>Night vision They can
see us through my GoPro</i>

26:24.640 --> 26:26.949
<i>She tried to negotiate
I said that's a no-no</i>

26:27.040 --> 26:29.315
<i>Now I'm creeping in her
bedroom like, "Go, go"</i>

26:29.440 --> 26:30.793
<i>She tells me to go low</i>

26:30.880 --> 26:32.016
<i>Then looks down
and says I've got to</i>

26:32.040 --> 26:36.397
<i>Terrorize that pussy
Got to terrorize that pussy</i>

26:36.480 --> 26:38.835
<i>So I did it
Improvised some crazy shit...</i>

26:39.240 --> 26:40.355
It's fucking awful.

26:40.440 --> 26:43.955
Conner's music may not be what
I listen to in my free time,

26:44.080 --> 26:46.753
but it seems to make
so many people money.

26:47.320 --> 26:52.519
<i>Mona Lisa You're
an overrated piece of shit</i>

26:52.680 --> 26:56.275
<i>Can someone explain
Why the whole wide world</i>

26:56.360 --> 26:58.749
<i>Is obsessed with
a Garbage Pail Kid</i>

26:58.840 --> 27:01.400
<i>Looks like a Garbage Pail Kid</i>

27:01.480 --> 27:04.278
<i>Y'all have been so amazing.
Thank you so much.</i>

27:04.360 --> 27:08.797
<i>What a beautiful night.
Everybody in the front, make some noise.</i>

27:10.000 --> 27:12.992
<i>Now everybody on the sides,
make some noise.</i>

27:15.040 --> 27:19.033
<i>Now everybody way up in the
upper deck, make some noise.</i>

27:21.400 --> 27:23.789
Conner,
I love you! I love you!

27:25.480 --> 27:26.959
<i>Harry, what the hell?</i>

27:27.080 --> 27:30.356
First of all, this is an
18,000-seat arena.

27:30.440 --> 27:34.479
Nobody sells this out. You sold 15,000
seats. That's still really good.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.757
No, it's not good.
Hammerleg sold this place out last week.

27:38.360 --> 27:39.918
Well, Aquaspin agrees with you.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.440
They're concerned
about ticket sales.

27:41.520 --> 27:44.671
What? But it's an 18,000 seat place.
Nobody sells that out.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.478
Hammerleg did last week.

27:46.920 --> 27:49.912
Look, the low record sales
are making them nervous.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.433
They wanna bring
on an opening act.

27:51.760 --> 27:54.115
What? We have an opening act.
Owen DJs.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.350
Hey, I'm always saying
Style Boyz could be the opener.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.158
No, man.
Will you stop with that?

27:58.280 --> 28:01.272
Dude, people keep blowing up my
Twitter about us doing <i>Donkey Roll.</i>

28:01.400 --> 28:03.016
- Oh, they're blowing up your Twitter?
- Yeah.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.416
How many followers
do you have, Owen?

28:04.440 --> 28:05.509
Like 500,000.

28:05.600 --> 28:09.149
Okay, well, I got 20 million, and no
one's asking me to do that shit, so...

28:11.000 --> 28:12.176
Some of those are probably bots.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.077
Okay, look, guys, regardless,

28:14.160 --> 28:16.435
we still have to decide
on an opening act.

28:16.520 --> 28:20.672
Man! All right, fine.
Does anybody have ideas?

28:20.800 --> 28:22.950
One, but you are gonna like it.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.436
Wait. Did you say
"are" or "aren't"?

28:26.160 --> 28:27.160
Are.

28:29.400 --> 28:33.109
<i>Yeah! You know I'm a
motherfucking piece of shit.</i>

28:33.640 --> 28:35.278
<i>Say,
"Fuck you, Hunter!"</i>

28:35.400 --> 28:36.958
<i>Fuck you, Hunter!</i>

28:37.040 --> 28:38.393
<i>Say, "Fuck you, Hunter!"</i>

28:38.480 --> 28:39.674
<i>Fuck you, Hunter!</i>

28:39.760 --> 28:40.760
Let's go.

28:40.800 --> 28:43.872
<i>Stomping through the forest
Like a retarded Tyrannosaurus</i>

28:43.960 --> 28:46.713
<i>Hunter eating beefcakes
In the back of a Ford Taurus</i>

28:46.800 --> 28:48.358
<i>Fuck the chorus Fuck my moms</i>

28:48.440 --> 28:50.112
<i>Fuck your dad Fuck this song</i>

28:55.800 --> 28:59.315
Hunter the Hungry is one of those
rappers who just doesn't give a fuck.

28:59.480 --> 29:00.960
<i>People think
that he ain't crazy.</i>

29:01.040 --> 29:03.554
No, he crazy for real.
I seen him backstage.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.296
He wasn't smoking the blunt.
He was just eating it.

29:05.320 --> 29:08.630
I mean Hunter's the youth, you know.
He's... He's what's next.

29:10.320 --> 29:11.673
<i>I'm talking our crew!</i>

29:14.040 --> 29:15.040
Oh!

29:15.640 --> 29:18.677
Conner4Real in the flesh?
Hey, yo!

29:19.000 --> 29:20.831
It's... It's an honor
to meet you, man.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.957
<i>CONNquest,</i> Style Boyz,
I grew up off that shit, man.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.275
Thanks. I wanna be you,
kind of, but not white.

29:26.360 --> 29:27.952
Like black still,
'cause it's strong.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.519
It's a strong color.
For sure, yeah.

29:29.640 --> 29:32.234
Like, you are that dude.
Like, have you met you?

29:32.480 --> 29:35.711
Have you met you?
You? Have you met you?

29:35.840 --> 29:37.376
Yeah, yeah. You know what I'm saying?
This is crazy.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.120
You be you.
You don't want me to be all that

29:39.200 --> 29:40.553
'cause I'll tear some shit up.

29:40.640 --> 29:42.336
- You know how it is?
- That is great...

29:45.600 --> 29:48.034
Hell, yeah! We gonna
turn up a show up here!

29:48.120 --> 29:49.120
Oh, don't hurt me.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.871
- You know how it is!
- Okay.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.708
But seriously, man.
I'm real honored, dawg.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.598
I'm not gonna let you down.
You my idol,

29:58.720 --> 30:01.837
right next to Jesus and Morgan Freeman.

30:02.360 --> 30:03.759
- All right, sure.
- Yeah.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.599
<i>Yeah, bitch! What up?</i>

30:05.680 --> 30:07.033
I like him.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.470
Where'd you get the cayenne?
Get off my basil.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.056
No, dawg. That's my basil, too.
Get off my basil, dude.

30:12.080 --> 30:13.115
That's my basil.

30:13.200 --> 30:14.616
- That's my basil, too.
- Come on, dude.

30:14.640 --> 30:17.096
And chives, son! And chives! Watch
me kill this deer real quick.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.394
Oh.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.560
- What? You can do that?
- That's deer meat, son.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.800
- That's deer meat, bitch.
- Whoa, dude.

30:22.840 --> 30:24.512
What is this crazy shit?

30:24.600 --> 30:26.318
Oh, dude!
That's your new head.

30:27.640 --> 30:28.755
What?

30:29.120 --> 30:31.076
I had it specially
made for you, man.

30:31.160 --> 30:33.016
I took the measurements
while you were sleeping.

30:33.040 --> 30:36.396
It's like on some
futuristic EDM shit.

30:36.600 --> 30:39.637
We did the research,
and EDM is hot.

30:39.720 --> 30:41.551
Robots on ecstasy and shit.

30:41.840 --> 30:45.435
Daft Punk, deadmau5,
DJ Tommy Pizza.

30:45.760 --> 30:49.753
Oprah Spinfrey,
Vinyl Ritchie, R2-LSD2,

30:49.920 --> 30:55.392
Ecstasy-3PO, LSD-3PO, Elton John.
All those dudes are crushing.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.696
- Look at all these functions.
- Yeah.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.438
It's like a Lite-Brite,
but it's moving.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.279
Oh, and check this out.

31:00.840 --> 31:02.956
Oh, wow! It goes all
the way up there.

31:03.040 --> 31:05.270
All the way, man.
It's like a beacon to space.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.918
And, plus, it makes this sound.

31:12.440 --> 31:13.759
Wow!

31:13.840 --> 31:15.114
Why would it make that sound?

31:15.200 --> 31:16.349
I don't even know,

31:16.440 --> 31:19.159
but it's nice to know that it's
there if you need it, you know.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.276
Yeah.
Yo, helmet's dope.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.556
Looks like the tip
of Optimus Prime's dick.

31:23.640 --> 31:26.313
See? Don't you wanna
look like Optimus Prime?

31:26.840 --> 31:27.955
His dick?
Fuck, yeah!

31:28.000 --> 31:31.072
Fuck, yeah! Yeah, man...
I don't know.

31:31.200 --> 31:35.637
Owen, please? Please, please
wear the helmet, Owen.

31:35.720 --> 31:38.473
Come on, man. The show really needs it.
Please, man.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.314
I mean, if it'll help the tour.
Yes.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.676
Yeah. Dude, we're killing this!

31:46.200 --> 31:48.430
<i>Well, howdy, ma'am
We're the two banditos...</i>

31:48.520 --> 31:50.840
<i>Having Hunter aboard
has really energized the tour.</i>

31:50.920 --> 31:51.955
Tickets are selling.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.599
<i>Hunter is the shit.</i>

31:55.840 --> 31:59.037
Aw! I love you, too, man.

31:59.120 --> 32:00.553
Dude!
Get off me, dude!

32:03.480 --> 32:05.596
<i>Yeah, you know
we're two banditos</i>

32:05.680 --> 32:10.310
<i>Yeah, you know
we're two banditos</i>

32:10.400 --> 32:12.436
<i>Do a little dance
and drink a little water</i>

32:12.520 --> 32:16.399
Putting that helmet on Owen's head,
that was a brilliant gimmick.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.038
I wish I'd done that with Zayn.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.315
We could've kept him
in One Direction for years.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.152
Prank time!

32:22.240 --> 32:24.231
Pranks is where it's at.
You know what I'm saying?

32:24.320 --> 32:26.311
Like, you've got
to have fun on tour, yo.

32:29.560 --> 32:30.788
Rise and shine, dude.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.376
<i>You know he's got
that sense of humor</i>

32:32.400 --> 32:35.676
where it's like,
"Stop now, please." "Please stop."

32:35.760 --> 32:37.576
But he keeps on going.
"Please stop doing this."

32:37.600 --> 32:39.875
<i>Eat a lot of burritos While
we're fucking bald eagles</i>

32:39.960 --> 32:41.791
<i>Let's go back to the
chorus, dude Okay</i>

32:41.880 --> 32:43.598
<i>We're two cute little kittens</i>

32:43.680 --> 32:45.671
<i>Yeah, we're two cute
little kittens</i>

32:45.760 --> 32:48.911
<i>Yeah, we're two cute little
kittens Shut the fuck up</i>

32:49.000 --> 32:51.798
Con ner, did you take a shit
in the Anne Frank House?

32:51.880 --> 32:54.633
Do not go in there.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.790
Whoo!

32:56.880 --> 32:58.199
<i>Ace Ventura.</i>

32:58.680 --> 33:00.576
<i>I fucked your first
cousin with the didgeridoo</i>

33:00.600 --> 33:02.400
<i>And when she came
You know, it sounded like...</i>

33:06.440 --> 33:08.749
<i>This is my new
best friend right here!</i>

33:09.000 --> 33:10.479
<i>This my nigga!</i>

33:10.680 --> 33:12.238
<i>Yeah, he's my friend!</i>

33:15.760 --> 33:17.318
All right, listen up, everybody.

33:17.400 --> 33:20.437
First of all, I wanna say congratulations
on a great show tonight.

33:20.840 --> 33:23.832
- Yeah.
- For the last eight shows,

33:23.920 --> 33:25.911
we have been sold out!

33:28.720 --> 33:31.001
It's like I was... I feel like
it's finally just clicking.

33:31.040 --> 33:33.349
Yeah.
Hey, we are on a roll, baby.

33:33.440 --> 33:34.953
Yeah.
Yeah.

33:35.040 --> 33:37.076
Is it helping album sales?
It's got to be, right?

33:37.200 --> 33:38.633
You know how it is, you know.

33:38.720 --> 33:41.314
Sometimes, it takes a while for
the marketplace to catch up.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.830
Don't worry.
Definitely helping Hunter.

33:43.920 --> 33:45.751
This dude's album
just went gold.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.271
Gold?
For real.

33:48.640 --> 33:50.392
How's that even...
That's a mistake, right?

33:50.880 --> 33:52.677
Our shit hasn't even gone gold.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.995
Look, he's just having
a moment. That's all.

33:55.080 --> 33:56.416
Well, how come
I'm not having a moment?

33:56.440 --> 33:57.953
You've had tons of moments.

33:58.040 --> 33:59.951
Don't worry.
There's plenty to go around.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.270
<i>Yo! Shout out to T.I.
in the house.</i>

34:02.360 --> 34:04.590
<i>What's up, soldier?
What's up, Ka-el? Okay.</i>

34:06.760 --> 34:09.956
<i>Y'all, my man Hunter the
Hungry is in the house.</i>

34:10.040 --> 34:12.156
<i>Y'all make some noise!</i>

34:14.199 --> 34:15.393
<i>What's up, Ka-el?</i>

34:15.480 --> 34:17.960
<i>Yo! Y'all wanna hear the hottest
song on the streets right now?</i>

34:18.000 --> 34:19.034
Yeah!

34:29.000 --> 34:32.231
<i>Stomping through the
forest Like a retarded Tyrannosaurus</i>

34:32.320 --> 34:35.118
<i>Hunter eating beefcakes In
the back of a Ford Taurus...</i>

34:35.199 --> 34:37.976
Look, man, Conner got all the way to
the top of this business, you know,

34:38.000 --> 34:42.277
and the higher you get, the harder
you fall. I mean, ask any coconut.

34:42.360 --> 34:45.670
Thing is, is that Conner's never
been as good as with the Style Boyz.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.592
Whatever him and Lawrence
were beefing over,

34:47.679 --> 34:49.360
they need to figure out
a way to squash it.

34:50.320 --> 34:54.472
Ever since Style Boyz broke up,
Lawrence has been mad at me.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.072
He claims he wrote my
famous catchphrase verse.

34:58.560 --> 35:01.597
<i>Translation,
he's a jealous-ass hater</i>

35:01.680 --> 35:05.389
<i>who's mad that I blew up, and he's
a farmer out in bumfuck nowhere,</i>

35:06.040 --> 35:08.349
but, you know,
we all have our take.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.356
Uh, this one here,
this is my Poppy.

35:11.600 --> 35:12.600
Uh...

35:12.680 --> 35:15.592
It's what I got for writing
Conner's famous catchphrase verse.

35:16.120 --> 35:18.759
If you look close,
you'll notice that it's not real

35:18.840 --> 35:22.196
because I didn't get a Poppy
or credit of any kind.

35:22.640 --> 35:26.110
<i>But there is one person that
I absolutely have to thank,</i>

35:26.200 --> 35:28.236
<i>and that person is me.</i>

35:28.320 --> 35:32.836
<i>Me, myself, and I! I did it all by myself.
Nobody helped me.</i>

35:33.360 --> 35:37.956
So, yeah, that's my Poppy.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.376
<i>I mean, if he's so great,</i>

35:39.400 --> 35:41.120
<i>how come he's not
making anything, you know?</i>

35:41.200 --> 35:43.873
Nothing's stopping him from going
out and writing a bunch of hits.

35:44.120 --> 35:46.839
<i>After the Style Boyz,
I tried some solo projects,</i>

35:46.920 --> 35:48.353
but none of them
really took off.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.711
<i>Old boots,
paper towels Shop girl, unknown fellow</i>

35:51.800 --> 35:55.156
<i>Deodorant, house keys
Sweatshirt, and umbrella</i>

35:55.240 --> 35:57.595
<i>A golf club,
basketball, bug spray</i>

35:57.680 --> 36:00.240
<i>A laundry heap,
a pocket knife, a battery</i>

36:00.320 --> 36:02.595
<i>These are the things in my Jeep</i>

36:03.640 --> 36:05.471
<i>These are the things in my Jeep</i>

36:05.600 --> 36:07.216
<i>I didn't really
relate to that song</i>

36:07.240 --> 36:08.958
because, you know,
I had different things

36:09.040 --> 36:10.837
in my Jeep than
he had in his Jeep.

36:11.640 --> 36:14.791
<i>I don't think Conner's living
real life. I think he's in a bubble</i>

36:14.880 --> 36:18.475
with people telling him what he wants
to hear and kissing his ass all day.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.274
<i>I heard he's getting
into stage gimmicks now.</i>

36:21.440 --> 36:23.351
<i>He's got Owen in
a helmet looking dumb,</i>

36:23.440 --> 36:25.396
<i>and one where
he sings from a toilet.</i>

36:25.600 --> 36:27.400
<i>Someone should've told him
that shit is whack,</i>

36:27.440 --> 36:30.591
<i>but he's so afraid of failure, man.
He's just getting desperate.</i>

36:31.640 --> 36:33.278
Let's try it again.

36:33.800 --> 36:34.800
Oh!

36:35.200 --> 36:36.200
Oh, it snagged.

36:36.280 --> 36:39.556
What's up, my confidants?
Be sure to come through to my show tonight.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.756
I'm trying a brand new
magic trick.

36:41.840 --> 36:43.512
<i>You know they said
it couldn't be done.</i>

36:43.600 --> 36:45.296
<i>That the trick that
was designed for a woman,</i>

36:45.320 --> 36:46.958
<i>and my junk would
get all tangled,</i>

36:47.040 --> 36:48.632
<i>but I figured out
how to solve it.</i>

36:48.760 --> 36:50.159
I think if I just
tuck it all back.

36:50.280 --> 36:51.838
See you tonight.

36:52.280 --> 36:53.315
Let's go.

36:53.440 --> 36:54.953
<i>Hey!</i>

36:55.680 --> 36:57.079
<i>What is this, y'all?</i>

36:57.160 --> 36:59.674
<i>I said upscale.
You took me to outer space.</i>

37:02.160 --> 37:03.960
<i>What do you say we take
it back down to Earth?</i>

37:04.800 --> 37:05.800
<i>Whoo!</i>

37:09.200 --> 37:10.269
<i>What?</i>

37:10.480 --> 37:13.552
<i>This almost looks like something
that a cowboy might wear.</i>

37:13.840 --> 37:15.637
<i>Are y'all looking at my chaps?</i>

37:17.160 --> 37:20.311
<i>But enough horsing around.
Let's take this uptown.</i>

37:20.640 --> 37:25.395
<i>How about a good old fashioned tuxedo?
There is no substitute.</i>

37:26.840 --> 37:28.114
<i>Top of the world!</i>

37:30.760 --> 37:31.829
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

37:32.160 --> 37:37.188
<i>No, no. It's tucked. I shaved for
the trick. Don't post those pics.</i>

37:37.280 --> 37:38.616
<i>As they approach
the end of the dark forest...</i>

37:38.640 --> 37:41.029
<i>It's an illusion. It's tucked.
I tuck it back.</i>

37:41.160 --> 37:42.354
<i>Conner, just hold on.</i>

37:42.760 --> 37:45.176
<i>- Don't post those.
- It's a tuck and take.</i>

37:45.200 --> 37:46.997
<i>I don't know what
to do right now.</i>

37:47.080 --> 37:49.469
<i>I wanna show you all my dick
but I can't show you my dick.</i>

37:49.760 --> 37:53.548
<i>It's a great conundrum.
It's a great conundrum.</i>

37:53.680 --> 37:55.955
Holy shit, dude.
Where the fuck was your dick, dawg?

37:56.080 --> 37:58.753
What happened out there?
What happened to the trick?

37:58.880 --> 38:00.871
Conner, don't worry.
Nobody saw anything.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.791
I wish they had seen something.

38:02.880 --> 38:04.936
Now, there's 10,000 people
that think I got no dick.

38:06.320 --> 38:09.039
- Wait. You guys know I have a dick, right?
- Yes.

38:09.160 --> 38:10.856
- You do. You do.
- Yeah, it's just that...

38:10.880 --> 38:12.456
I've always
believed you had a dick.

38:12.480 --> 38:15.153
Right, right, right.
But like where was it, though?

38:15.320 --> 38:17.117
Because that
motherfucker was gone.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.269
We've gone over this.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.913
You know I've got
to tuck my shit back

38:20.000 --> 38:22.036
so it doesn't get tangled
up in the garments.

38:22.120 --> 38:23.997
That makes perfect sense.
Of course.

38:24.080 --> 38:25.256
You've got to put it
in between your legs.

38:25.280 --> 38:27.696
Conner, don't worry about it.
You were up there for, like, 10 seconds.

38:27.720 --> 38:29.551
Ten seconds is
an eternity, Harry.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.232
It's a third of the way to Mars.

38:31.560 --> 38:32.993
Conner, we've talked about this.

38:33.120 --> 38:36.157
Thirty Seconds to Mars is the
name of a band. It's not a fact.

38:36.320 --> 38:39.392
Look, thank you, dawg,
because this shit was hilarious, man.

38:39.480 --> 38:42.631
Well, I'm so glad that I
could entertain you, Hunter.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.896
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about this, would you?

38:44.920 --> 38:46.399
Oh! I wish.

38:46.480 --> 38:49.995
This is like genius prank
shit right here. Next level.

38:50.080 --> 38:53.117
You would have to be the
best prankster of all time

38:53.200 --> 38:54.872
to think of something like this,

38:55.240 --> 38:59.028
and, well, shit, that's me.
Maybe I did do it.

39:00.720 --> 39:02.438
No, I didn't do it,

39:02.520 --> 39:03.919
or did I?

39:04.240 --> 39:05.468
No, I didn't,

39:06.000 --> 39:07.558
or maybe I did

39:07.640 --> 39:08.709
not

39:09.080 --> 39:10.354
do it.
Did you?

39:10.440 --> 39:14.115
I didn't do it, or I did.
Who knows? I don't.

39:14.400 --> 39:17.153
Conner, don't worry. Don't worry.
This is not news.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.514
- What the fuck?
- Son...

39:22.600 --> 39:24.272
The timing of that was crazy.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.796
They should call
him NoDick4Real.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.440
Whoa!

39:45.920 --> 39:48.639
It was tucked, Linda.
It's part of the show.

39:48.760 --> 39:51.797
- No. No, don't print that.
- Everywhere I look. It's insane.

39:51.880 --> 39:53.871
Now it's on the front
page of <i>USA Today,</i>

39:53.960 --> 39:55.951
the most respected
newspaper in the world.

39:56.080 --> 39:58.913
Sweetie, relax. All we
need is a different story

39:59.040 --> 40:00.720
to wipe it out of the press cycle.
Mmm-hmm.

40:00.760 --> 40:02.910
Okay, so what?
What do we do?

40:03.000 --> 40:04.911
Anything.
Release a new single.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.993
Get a crazy haircut, or, uh, take
an ugly teenager to the prom.

40:09.320 --> 40:11.311
All good ideas.
Let's keep thinking about it,

40:11.560 --> 40:13.280
and I'm gonna go tweet
a picture of my dick.

40:13.320 --> 40:14.992
Okay, don't really do that.

40:22.840 --> 40:26.515
<i>Man, I just think it's gonna
really change people's perception of me</i>

40:26.600 --> 40:28.352
<i>in a good, positive way,</i>

40:28.440 --> 40:31.318
and also I'm really glad about the
fact that we'll get married, too,

40:31.400 --> 40:32.628
'cause I like her so much.

40:33.040 --> 40:35.080
- Conner, what's going on?
- You'll see.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.560
- Oh, my God! Is that music?
- Yeah.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.473
Almost there and...

40:40.440 --> 40:41.440
Uh-huh.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.113
You ready?
Mmm-hmm.

40:47.200 --> 40:48.952
Are those real wolves?

40:49.040 --> 40:50.837
Yeah.
Conner.

40:51.400 --> 40:54.710
<i>My psychic told me
that, in my previous life, I was a wolf,</i>

40:55.040 --> 40:57.110
which makes so much sense,

40:57.520 --> 41:00.080
<i>but I can't believe
that Conner remembered.</i>

41:00.800 --> 41:03.712
And you invited the press.
Yeah.

41:03.920 --> 41:08.710
<i>I landed in
London At a quarter to noon</i>

41:09.200 --> 41:12.158
Oh, my God, is that Seal?
Yeah.

41:12.280 --> 41:14.236
What is this?
What's going on?

41:15.880 --> 41:20.715
<i>I know she's exquisite
So I had to visit</i>

41:21.080 --> 41:23.355
<i>Pushed my back to
the front of the door</i>

41:23.440 --> 41:25.476
Ever since I met you,

41:25.560 --> 41:28.552
I knew in my heart that
you were super banging.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.597
<i>Ashley Wednesday</i>

41:31.160 --> 41:33.993
Hey, dude, you've got to kill this music.
The wolves are going crazy.

41:35.400 --> 41:36.913
I can't stop Seal from singing.

41:37.080 --> 41:39.196
<i>With impeccable style</i>

41:40.400 --> 41:42.436
All right, can we get the
wolves to be more quiet?

41:43.360 --> 41:44.360
No.

41:46.840 --> 41:47.955
Ashley Wednesday,

41:50.200 --> 41:51.315
will you marry me?

41:51.400 --> 41:54.278
<i>Please freaking say yes, girl</i>

41:54.480 --> 41:56.311
Yes. Yes.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.056
The wolves are loose!

41:58.080 --> 41:59.256
- Look out!
- Shit!

41:59.280 --> 42:00.315
Shit. Okay.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.549
Oh, God!

42:01.640 --> 42:03.198
Move! Run now!

42:12.280 --> 42:14.456
<i>Jesus Christ,
we got wild animals everywhere...</i>

42:14.480 --> 42:15.708
My God!

42:15.800 --> 42:17.279
Get on!

42:17.360 --> 42:18.634
Seal, come on!
Hurry!

42:19.200 --> 42:21.350
Are you okay?
I'm fine. For a second...

42:23.120 --> 42:24.189
Seal!

42:24.280 --> 42:25.280
Seal! Shit!

42:25.360 --> 42:26.634
Oh!

42:28.280 --> 42:30.236
Oh, my God, you got him, dude!

42:30.360 --> 42:32.715
Don't worry.
I've been in this situation before.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.160
How do you think
I got these scars?

42:34.200 --> 42:35.235
From wolves?

42:35.320 --> 42:37.436
Fucking wolves.
Now let's get out of here.

42:39.400 --> 42:40.469
What the fuck?

42:40.560 --> 42:42.835
Go! Go!
Go!

42:42.920 --> 42:44.876
We killed Seal. He's dead!

42:44.960 --> 42:46.837
He's dead!
Seal is dead!

42:46.960 --> 42:50.555
<i>Conner4Real is being sued
by R&B singer Seal for $5 million.</i>

42:50.640 --> 42:51.800
Why would he do that to Seal?

42:51.880 --> 42:53.518
Conner4Real is such a joke.

42:53.600 --> 42:54.936
He disappointed all of us.
I mean like...

42:54.960 --> 42:56.000
Did you see that proposal?

42:56.040 --> 42:57.616
Like, I don't even think
they like each other.

42:57.640 --> 42:59.016
'Cause Conner definitely
ain't the real deal.

42:59.040 --> 43:00.359
He doesn't even have a dick.

43:00.440 --> 43:03.796
I used to like Conner4Real,
but now I wish he would just go away.

43:04.200 --> 43:07.237
<i>My first guest, Conner4Real!</i>

43:08.520 --> 43:10.909
I just wanna thank Seal again
and wish him a fast recovery.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.149
He's gonna be fine.

43:12.240 --> 43:13.434
That's great news.

43:13.520 --> 43:16.193
That's great news, and congrats
again to you and Ashley.

43:16.320 --> 43:17.656
Thank you. Thank you, and,
you know, don't forget,

43:17.680 --> 43:20.035
<i>CONNquest</i>
in stores now. Cop that.

43:20.120 --> 43:22.680
Yeah, absolutely.

43:22.760 --> 43:25.149
Can I just fanboy
out for a second?

43:25.240 --> 43:27.151
Uh, because my favorite
thing of yours

43:27.280 --> 43:29.748
from back in the day,
the Donkey Roll. Oh!

43:29.840 --> 43:31.831
You got a minute?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:31.960 --> 43:33.279
For the kids out there,

43:33.360 --> 43:35.954
the Donkey Roll is
from Conner's old group,

43:36.040 --> 43:38.270
the Style Boyz, when I was...

43:39.640 --> 43:40.776
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.950
I don't wanna brag but
I used to do a mean

43:43.040 --> 43:44.439
Donkey Roll back in college.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.476
I'm just saying.
Oh, for real?

43:46.600 --> 43:49.637
Some said I did it
better than yours.

43:51.960 --> 43:53.056
Come on, now.
No...

43:53.080 --> 43:55.071
Don't do that, Jimmy Fallon.

43:55.160 --> 43:57.754
I think I saw Kid
Contact backstage.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.800
Do you think that we could
get him out here and...

44:01.360 --> 44:02.679
I doubt he'd be into that.

44:05.560 --> 44:07.198
Y'all set me up?

44:08.080 --> 44:09.080
Oh!

44:11.400 --> 44:14.995
Okay, I'll be filling in for Kid Brain!
Roots, Donkey-Roll us!

44:21.200 --> 44:22.758
I love the Donkey Roll.

44:22.840 --> 44:26.196
The Donkey Roll was the shit.
That's the reason why I dance.

44:26.280 --> 44:29.556
Every junior high dance had
to end with the Donkey Roll.

44:29.640 --> 44:32.234
I dreamed of doing the Donkey
Roll onstage with them.

44:35.400 --> 44:36.400
Yo, that was impressive!

44:36.480 --> 44:37.515
It's all right.

44:37.600 --> 44:38.600
Thanks, everybody.

44:40.360 --> 44:42.749
Yo, dude, how fun was that shit?

44:42.920 --> 44:44.319
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

44:44.400 --> 44:45.760
I wish Lawrence
could've been here.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.639
Owen, that sucked.

44:47.720 --> 44:50.280
I'm trying to sell a record,
not stroll down memory lane.

44:50.360 --> 44:51.880
That shit made me
look like a has-been.

44:52.160 --> 44:53.957
Come on, man.
The crowd loved it.

44:54.640 --> 44:55.640
Whatever, man.

44:57.600 --> 44:58.600
Conner.

45:08.240 --> 45:10.280
<i>Well, look,
you have to understand something.</i>

45:10.360 --> 45:12.555
<i>Conner's lived
a very blessed life.</i>

45:12.640 --> 45:15.108
<i>He got very successful
very, very young.</i>

45:15.200 --> 45:16.269
No, no, no.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.595
<i>And because of that,
he never really learned</i>

45:18.680 --> 45:20.830
to handle adversity
in an adult way.

45:20.920 --> 45:24.117
<i>How many people here bought
my new album</i> CONNquest?

45:25.320 --> 45:28.153
<i>All y'all are liars!
I know you didn't buy it!</i>

45:28.240 --> 45:30.470
<i>Do you guys even
like me anymore?</i>

45:30.560 --> 45:31.656
<i>Could've seen this coming.</i>

45:31.680 --> 45:34.478
<i>Conner4Real dumped by new fiancée,
Ashley Wednesday.</i>

45:34.640 --> 45:36.256
Hey, Conner,
why did Ashley dump you, bro?

45:36.280 --> 45:38.589
- Get the fuck off me.
- Yo, man!

45:38.680 --> 45:39.749
Son of a bitch!

45:39.840 --> 45:42.576
- Yo, I could really use you out here, man.
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

45:42.600 --> 45:44.591
Yo, we're in Denver tomorrow.

45:44.720 --> 45:46.870
<i>Come through.
I'll send a car for you.</i>

45:46.960 --> 45:48.120
He really wants to apologize?

45:48.160 --> 45:49.256
<i>Yes. He really...</i>

45:49.280 --> 45:50.280
Stop. Down.

45:50.360 --> 45:51.640
This business can be crazy, man.

45:51.720 --> 45:54.518
That's why it's so important to
be around people that you trust,

45:54.600 --> 45:55.640
<i>that you've grown up with.</i>

45:55.720 --> 45:56.994
I mean...
What is that?

45:57.080 --> 45:58.991
<i>And, plus,
Lawrence was always the one</i>

45:59.080 --> 46:01.355
<i>who could cheer
Conner up, you know.</i>

46:02.320 --> 46:03.320
Mmm-hmm.

46:03.400 --> 46:07.188
Dude, please. He really needs
his real friends right now.

46:07.720 --> 46:09.631
<i>He needs you.</i>

46:10.000 --> 46:11.592
Yo, what's that sound
in the background?

46:11.680 --> 46:15.355
Oh, it's just my girlfriend.
I'm having sex with her.

46:16.200 --> 46:19.749
All right, man. Maybe, you know?
Maybe. I'll think about it.

46:19.880 --> 46:23.156
<i>So last night, I caught a
little bit of this obscure old movie</i>

46:23.240 --> 46:24.559
called <i>The Parent Trap,</i> right?

46:24.640 --> 46:27.712
<i>In that movie,
these two little red-headed girls,</i>

46:27.800 --> 46:30.837
<i>they get the idea to trick
their divorced parents</i>

46:30.920 --> 46:33.150
<i>into falling back in
love with each other,</i>

46:33.240 --> 46:38.997
so I was like, "Yo, if I just get Lawrence
and Conner in the same room together,

46:39.080 --> 46:41.674
"boom, they're gonna
realize that they're friends,

46:41.760 --> 46:44.035
"and we all can all
be buddies again."

46:53.760 --> 46:55.239
<i>Mona Lisa</i>

46:55.320 --> 46:58.790
<i>You're an overrated
piece of shit</i>

46:58.920 --> 47:00.990
<i>What the fuck is this garbage</i>

47:01.080 --> 47:02.877
Tyrus, shut up, man.
We're watching TV.

47:02.960 --> 47:03.960
Quiet, fool.

47:04.040 --> 47:06.759
Leave the singing to the professionals,
please. Yeah?

47:06.840 --> 47:07.955
You're right.
I'm sorry.

47:08.040 --> 47:09.792
And cut softer, dawg.

47:15.560 --> 47:18.199
<i>Dedicated to
the people of Ethpania.</i>

47:19.200 --> 47:22.510
We were on the road
in Spain, and I noticed

47:22.600 --> 47:28.789
that the people there pronounce the
letter S with, like, a T-H "th" sound,

47:28.880 --> 47:34.193
so instead of saying Spain,
they say Thpain, you know,

47:34.280 --> 47:38.319
and it's like the whole country
has a crazy speech impediment,

47:38.400 --> 47:40.118
so I wrote a thong about that.

47:41.280 --> 47:44.750
<i>In Ibitha, tha, tha, tha</i>

47:44.880 --> 47:48.316
<i>Every day's a fiesta, tha, tha</i>

47:48.520 --> 47:52.354
<i>Speakers boom On the dance
floor, floor, floor</i>

47:52.440 --> 47:55.876
<i>Everyone is a star,
star, star, star</i>

47:55.960 --> 47:58.838
<i>Our tummies are
full of Pae-jhay-ah</i>

48:00.200 --> 48:01.792
All right.
Thanks, man.

48:01.880 --> 48:03.108
Man, good shit.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.918
You dropped in
perfect right on that one.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.433
Oh, thanks, man.
Thanks.

48:06.520 --> 48:10.035
Oh, I invited Lawrence to come
to the after-party tonight,

48:10.120 --> 48:11.519
so he might be here.

48:11.600 --> 48:12.794
What? Lawrence is here?

48:12.880 --> 48:15.872
Yeah, man. You know, I told you
he lives right nearby here,

48:15.960 --> 48:17.776
so I just thought it'd
be cool for him to come.

48:17.800 --> 48:19.656
He actually... He wanted
to apologize to you, I think...

48:19.680 --> 48:22.990
Owen, are you trying
to <i>Parent Trap</i> us?

48:25.040 --> 48:26.155
No.

48:27.400 --> 48:28.992
God, he looks like a caveman.

48:29.600 --> 48:31.795
Look at this fool.
He's about to murder somebody.

48:31.880 --> 48:33.800
I think it's just
the lighting in the limo.

48:33.840 --> 48:34.989
What?

48:35.080 --> 48:38.311
No, seriously, I think that
that's just his resting face.

48:38.400 --> 48:40.118
He's just relaxing.

48:40.200 --> 48:42.656
So, what, he'll just apologize to me,
and I'm supposed to forgive him,

48:42.680 --> 48:45.069
and then we go back to
being a big happy family?

48:45.640 --> 48:47.676
Something like that, yeah.

48:48.320 --> 48:50.470
All right.

48:56.120 --> 48:59.157
Style Boyz in the house, right?

49:07.120 --> 49:08.439
No. No.
Fuck this.

49:08.520 --> 49:10.078
No. No!
Fans got through the gate.

49:10.200 --> 49:13.909
We've got to lock up. Let me out, man.
Unlock the doors.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.070
Yeah, you should go, man.
Bail. That's your move.

49:16.160 --> 49:18.230
That's not my move. That's your move.
You bailed.

49:18.320 --> 49:20.117
I didn't bail.
People liked me best,

49:20.200 --> 49:22.236
and you couldn't handle it,
so I did my own thing.

49:22.320 --> 49:24.276
People liked you best
'cause of the shit I wrote.

49:24.360 --> 49:27.056
They don't like your shit. They like
my shit, and they don't even know it.

49:27.080 --> 49:30.311
Take a look around, Lawrence.
If you were so important to my success,

49:30.400 --> 49:33.358
how come my solo shit's way
bigger than Style Boyz ever was?

49:33.440 --> 49:35.112
You got Owen
making all your beats,

49:35.240 --> 49:37.160
and now you ditched him,
and your shit's tanking.

49:37.240 --> 49:39.356
Why can't you just
give me any credit, man?

49:39.440 --> 49:40.839
Just admit that I'm talented?

49:40.920 --> 49:43.229
Why can't you admit that I
wrote the "catchphrase" verse?

49:43.320 --> 49:44.320
Oh, this shit again.

49:44.400 --> 49:46.456
None of this garbage out
here is possible without me.

49:46.480 --> 49:49.233
Admit that shit. Man, what the
fuck is going on out there?

49:49.440 --> 49:51.112
Conner, sign my tits!
Oh, what this?

49:51.200 --> 49:53.998
This is just some
beautiful-ass titties, man.

49:54.080 --> 49:57.231
My fans ask me to sign them all
the time because they love me,

49:57.320 --> 49:58.878
and I love them, Lawrence.

49:58.960 --> 50:01.235
And you know what?
You need to grow up, dude,

50:01.320 --> 50:05.313
because this right here,
this is what it's all about, my friend.

50:05.400 --> 50:07.994
Making art.
Connecting with people.

50:08.080 --> 50:10.435
This is that
rock star life, my man,

50:10.520 --> 50:14.354
and I'm slurping it down like
a big old fat milkshake.

50:14.440 --> 50:15.919
Hey, Conner?
Not now, Owen.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.991
- Just...
- I'm gonna sign these titties,

50:18.080 --> 50:21.470
so sit back and watch how it's done,
my friend. I'm gonna...

50:21.560 --> 50:23.516
Oh, shit! Oh! It's a dick!

50:23.600 --> 50:25.397
That's one of your
fans, man. Go for it.

50:25.480 --> 50:26.959
Can you make it out to Jenna?

50:27.040 --> 50:28.075
Oh, hello.
That's me.

50:28.160 --> 50:29.195
It's nice to meet you.

50:29.280 --> 50:31.236
That's my fiance's penis. Ah.

50:31.320 --> 50:32.355
Big fan.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.158
Thanks, man.
So tight. Okay.

50:34.240 --> 50:36.310
He's inside.
I'm just gonna...

50:36.400 --> 50:40.712
The old John Hancock.

50:40.800 --> 50:42.756
Are you guys getting back together?
Style Boyz?

50:42.840 --> 50:43.840
- No.
- No.

50:43.920 --> 50:45.176
We're thinking about it.
Right on.

50:45.200 --> 50:47.236
I'm gonna roll the
window up now so just...

50:47.320 --> 50:49.390
Thanks for coming by.
Great to meet you guys.

50:49.480 --> 50:51.152
I rest my case, Lawrence.

50:51.240 --> 50:53.037
You think you know what's up,

50:53.120 --> 50:57.113
but in fact, you my friend,
have no idea what's going on.

50:57.760 --> 50:59.079
Don't call me again.

50:59.200 --> 51:01.953
Lawrence, dude.
Don't leave like that.

51:03.480 --> 51:04.480
Shit.

51:04.600 --> 51:06.795
We should probably
hit the car wash.

51:10.480 --> 51:13.916
<i>All work and no play
Make Hunter go crazy</i>

51:14.000 --> 51:17.709
<i>All play and no work Make
Hunter feel just as depressed</i>

51:17.800 --> 51:18.800
<i>I'm OJ I'm Simpson</i>

51:18.840 --> 51:20.910
<i>I'm Martha I'm Plimpton</i>

51:21.240 --> 51:23.196
Finally heard back
from the Poppies.

51:23.280 --> 51:26.352
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, they love you.

51:26.440 --> 51:30.433
Um, they just don't have
enough room for you this year.

51:30.520 --> 51:32.078
What? For real?

51:32.160 --> 51:34.196
Yeah, it's a bummer. I know.

51:34.320 --> 51:37.517
I told them to keep us in
mind if anything changes.

51:37.600 --> 51:38.715
It could come around.

51:38.800 --> 51:40.472
This business is tough.

51:40.560 --> 51:46.032
The highs are high, and the
lows are low, you know.

51:46.440 --> 51:47.440
It's like a wave.

51:47.520 --> 51:49.720
You've just got to learn how
to ride the wave, you know.

51:49.760 --> 51:51.796
Up and down, just like that.

51:51.920 --> 51:54.434
Tony! Toni! Tone! Tonee?

51:54.520 --> 51:55.873
Bartending.

51:56.960 --> 51:59.997
Style Boyz, Conner4Real.

52:02.800 --> 52:05.314
That means I might be
going down again soon.

52:05.400 --> 52:07.436
<i>Heya, heya, ho</i>

52:07.560 --> 52:09.630
Harry, he's 30 minutes over.

52:09.720 --> 52:11.358
I'm sure he'll be done soon.

52:11.480 --> 52:15.109
<i>I'm never gonna leave this stage!
I'm gonna die up here!</i>

52:16.320 --> 52:17.435
All right, that's it.

52:17.520 --> 52:18.794
Owen, get your gear.

52:18.880 --> 52:19.915
Got it.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
Frank, queue it up.

52:21.040 --> 52:22.120
Conner, what are you doing?

52:22.240 --> 52:23.639
I'm going on, Harry.

52:23.720 --> 52:26.792
<i>You better get a bedpan!
I'll be here all night, bitch!</i>

52:27.640 --> 52:30.074
<i>Who came here to see
Hunter the Hungry?</i>

52:31.440 --> 52:35.752
<i>And who came here
to see Conner4Real?</i>

52:41.840 --> 52:43.478
What's up, y'all?

52:53.920 --> 52:54.920
What'd you just say?

52:56.120 --> 52:58.190
<i>Contact, skip the intro.
Go to</i> Humble.

52:58.320 --> 53:00.856
<i>Stomping through the
forest Like a retarded Tyrannosaurus</i>

53:00.880 --> 53:02.456
<i>Bar none, I am the most humblest</i>

53:02.480 --> 53:04.616
<i>In the back of
a Ford Taurus Fuck the chorus</i>

53:04.640 --> 53:06.921
<i>Number one
at the top of the humble list</i>

53:13.960 --> 53:15.360
All right, Harry.
We've got to talk.

53:15.440 --> 53:17.192
I know. That was a mess
out there tonight.

53:17.280 --> 53:18.998
Yeah, we have to
get rid of Hunter.

53:19.080 --> 53:20.513
We can't fire Hunter.

53:20.600 --> 53:23.239
Conner, I mean he's one of the
reasons that the tour's sold out.

53:23.320 --> 53:24.435
I want him off the tour.

53:24.520 --> 53:27.990
Well, look he's number one
on Bonkohub right now.

53:28.080 --> 53:29.274
Well, what number are we?

53:29.360 --> 53:31.510
Numbers don't matter. Come on.
You know that.

53:31.640 --> 53:33.471
God. Can we
talk about this helmet?

53:33.560 --> 53:35.755
It's crazy heavy, and it's
really hurting my back.

53:35.840 --> 53:38.256
Owen, why are you talking right now?
Why are you in this meeting?

53:38.280 --> 53:39.713
I'm in all of our meetings.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.758
Dude, just leave, all right?
Go have a meeting with Lawrence.

53:42.840 --> 53:45.308
You know it's not my fault that
the album's not selling, okay?

53:45.400 --> 53:46.674
Don't take it out on me.

53:46.760 --> 53:47.988
Great.

53:48.120 --> 53:50.509
Harry, we have to get rid
of Hunter, all right?

53:50.600 --> 53:53.797
I'm not asking. I'm telling.
You represent me, not him.

53:54.320 --> 53:58.632
Okay, look, well,
actually, technically,

54:00.640 --> 54:03.632
full disclosure,
I represent both of you.

54:04.840 --> 54:05.840
What?

54:07.200 --> 54:08.269
Yeah.

54:08.360 --> 54:09.429
You signed him?

54:09.520 --> 54:10.669
Conner, come on.

54:10.760 --> 54:11.800
Are you kidding me, Harry?

54:11.840 --> 54:13.034
It's just business.

54:13.120 --> 54:16.954
It's not to me. All right, look,
decide right now. Him or me?

54:17.040 --> 54:19.838
Come on. Don't go there.
Look, I've got a family to feed.

54:19.920 --> 54:21.239
What? No, you don't.

54:21.360 --> 54:23.430
I have a niece.
We all have a niece!

54:23.520 --> 54:25.238
You know what?

54:25.800 --> 54:26.869
You're fired.

54:26.960 --> 54:30.839
Conner, you're just... You're upset,
and you're overreacting.

54:32.160 --> 54:33.878
Okay, now I've got to
collate that.

54:33.960 --> 54:35.757
Great. Have fun collating.

54:36.160 --> 54:38.276
There's no fun in collating!

54:39.520 --> 54:43.274
What's up, my confidants?
Who can you really trust?

54:43.360 --> 54:45.430
<i>I thought I could
trust my manager,</i>

54:45.520 --> 54:49.229
<i>but it turned out he was stabbing
me in the back the whole time.</i>

54:49.320 --> 54:50.799
<i>I thought I could trust Seal.</i>

54:52.040 --> 54:53.792
<i>I thought I could
trust the Yelp reviews</i>

54:53.880 --> 54:58.192
<i>of PartyWolves.com.
Really makes you think, doesn't it?</i>

54:58.280 --> 55:03.718
<i>Who's out there scheming behind my back,
trying to take what I built.</i>

55:03.800 --> 55:06.792
<i>I need to find out
who I can really trust.</i>

55:19.200 --> 55:21.760
All right, y'all,
come and get them.

55:21.880 --> 55:24.348
Conner's fancy
flapjacks right here!

55:24.440 --> 55:26.431
Thanks, Conner.

55:26.520 --> 55:28.750
Eat up. Eat up. Eat up.

55:29.040 --> 55:30.268
Mmm. Mmm.

55:32.240 --> 55:33.275
Mmm!

55:33.360 --> 55:34.998
Sponge, you like those pancakes?

55:35.960 --> 55:37.120
- They're so good.
- Yeah.

55:37.200 --> 55:39.350
Yeah.
Eddie? Feeling these?

55:41.480 --> 55:42.595
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.478
Dude, I'm sorry. I can't.

55:45.560 --> 55:48.358
Conn, these are terrible, man.
I'm really sorry.

55:48.440 --> 55:50.874
Thank you, Owen, truly.

55:51.360 --> 55:53.430
Okay. And the rest
of you liked them?

55:54.280 --> 55:56.032
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.
Yup.

55:56.120 --> 56:00.113
Well, that's very disappointing
because they are not good.

56:00.200 --> 56:01.200
I knew it.

56:01.280 --> 56:04.431
And the reason they're not good is
because I put dog shit in them.

56:04.520 --> 56:05.635
What?

56:05.720 --> 56:08.439
Oh! Dang, dude. That's nasty.
That's hilarious.

56:08.520 --> 56:12.115
The reason that I did that is to
see who would tell me the truth.

56:12.280 --> 56:14.191
Oh! Conn,
that's mad smart.

56:14.280 --> 56:15.793
Yeah. He's always
two steps ahead.

56:15.880 --> 56:17.791
No. No, stop
doing that, you guys.

56:18.200 --> 56:19.296
This is what I'm talking about.

56:19.320 --> 56:21.117
You can't just agree
with everything I say.

56:21.240 --> 56:22.736
No doubt. No doubt. No doubt.
It's not helpful.

56:22.760 --> 56:23.760
Got to be honest.

56:23.840 --> 56:25.796
No, you're doing it again, all right?
Just stop.

56:25.880 --> 56:29.031
You fed us dog shit?
What is wrong with you?

56:29.120 --> 56:30.553
Owen, chill out, man.

56:30.640 --> 56:32.616
You're the only one who passed the test.
You're good.

56:32.640 --> 56:35.598
How the fuck can you think I
was one of your lackeys, dude?

56:35.680 --> 56:36.795
I'm your oldest friend.

56:37.080 --> 56:38.957
Hey, we're friends!
We're all friends.

56:39.080 --> 56:41.071
I should've told you
to fuck off years ago,

56:41.160 --> 56:43.480
but instead I just let you
become a bigger and bigger dick.

56:43.520 --> 56:45.715
Look, I'm sorry, but
I've kept you on the tour.

56:45.800 --> 56:48.109
I keep you paid.
I put food on the table.

56:48.200 --> 56:49.394
With dog shit in it!

56:49.480 --> 56:51.391
It's the thought
that counts, man.

56:51.480 --> 56:53.311
Oh, my God.
That's it. I quit.

56:53.400 --> 56:54.674
You can't quit.

56:54.760 --> 56:56.318
What do I even
do anymore, Conner?

56:56.400 --> 56:59.790
I push play on an iPod
in a robot costume.

56:59.880 --> 57:02.838
All right,
fine, then. Go.

57:03.800 --> 57:04.915
Fine.

57:05.840 --> 57:06.909
Fine.

57:08.120 --> 57:09.189
Fine.

57:19.240 --> 57:20.673
Maximus!

57:21.200 --> 57:22.792
I'm home, buddy.

57:23.840 --> 57:27.037
Sometimes,
he kicks it in here. Max!

57:29.800 --> 57:30.994
You hear that?

57:32.360 --> 57:33.429
Max?

57:34.360 --> 57:37.113
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

57:37.200 --> 57:40.715
Why are you all white?
Why is he making that sound?

57:42.560 --> 57:45.120
Oh, fuck! There's something
wrong with Maximus!

57:45.200 --> 57:47.668
His scales are all ashy.
Come on!

57:49.640 --> 57:54.794
No! Get out of the way!
Move! Come on!

57:55.280 --> 57:57.714
Please! Please move!
My turtle is sick.

57:57.800 --> 58:01.076
I've got to get him to the hospital.
He's gonna die.

58:01.800 --> 58:05.349
Maximus!

58:08.520 --> 58:11.717
As I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

58:12.240 --> 58:16.074
I take a look at my life and
realize there's nothing left.

58:16.400 --> 58:19.710
<i>Maximus was my best friend,
who struggled daily</i>

58:19.800 --> 58:23.509
<i>with soggy bones syndrome,
but never complained once.</i>

58:23.600 --> 58:27.752
<i>Conner4Real fighting with
Martin Sheen, gets knocked the "F" out.</i>

58:27.840 --> 58:29.296
<i>The guy from</i> The West Wing?

58:29.320 --> 58:31.416
<i>Things going from
bad to worse for Conner4Real,</i>

58:31.440 --> 58:35.069
<i>seen unconscious, rolling
around town on a hoverboard.</i>

58:35.320 --> 58:39.154
Now go and join your
family in turtle heaven.

58:44.080 --> 58:45.115
Fuck, yeah!

59:04.560 --> 59:07.358
It's time, man.
You've got to know when to go home.

59:07.480 --> 59:09.471
Bro, you've got to
know when to let go.

59:09.560 --> 59:13.439
The key is don't play yourself.
That's it. Very simple.

59:13.520 --> 59:17.798
Don't play yourself.
Congratulations, you played yourself.

59:17.880 --> 59:19.359
You guys win.

59:20.600 --> 59:23.239
I get the message.
I'll go away.

59:23.320 --> 59:26.437
This is Conner4Real signing off.

59:35.040 --> 59:37.076
<i>So, I am back in Sac,</i>

59:37.160 --> 59:41.358
<i>housesitting for my mom 'cause
she's on tour with Fall Out Boy.</i>

59:41.440 --> 59:42.668
Are you guys filming me?

59:42.720 --> 59:44.950
<i>It's been awesome, you know.</i>

59:45.040 --> 59:47.270
Dude, which one of
y'all pissed on me?

59:47.400 --> 59:50.233
<i>Feels really good to reconnect
with my hometown.</i>

59:50.320 --> 59:55.952
<i>I've just been really living a very
simple life, kind of back to basics.</i>

59:56.720 --> 59:59.154
I've been watching
a lot of dressage,

59:59.280 --> 01:00:03.831
which is a very elevated, uh,
competitive form of horse dancing,

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:07.869
<i>and I've been doing a lot of
painting and a lot of sketching.</i>

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.468
<i>I'm doing a series
on show ponies.</i>

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.880
I actually have a lot of
trouble with the hooves.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:16.190
It's hard to get
like a hoof texture.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.590
This one is, like,
pretty accurate, actually.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.676
I'll show you guys the
horse that I based it on.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.796
Anyway, it's not my best one.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.074
Um, like, in retrospect,

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.594
I probably wouldn't have
used that shade of green.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.478
<i>I've even been selling
some of them online,</i>

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.790
<i>which has been
a cool new experience.</i>

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.549
Ooh! Sold.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.833
Eleven-fifty.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.434
You know, it's not Conner4Real
numbers, you know,

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:43.034
but, in a way, it means more.

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.879
<i>That's pretty much it, you know.
That's my life now.</i>

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.275
Hello?

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.360
Hey!

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.435
What's up, dude?
You guys, Paula's here.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.748
What's going on?

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.592
Just wanted to check up on you.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.358
You want a drink?

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.034
Uh, no. It's 11:00.
It's 11:00 in the morning.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.190
It's 11:30
somewhere.

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.276
Can we please turn this off?

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.914
Look at those little nerds.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.996
We were very cool for
our school district.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.559
<i>My birthday is awesome.</i>

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.456
Yeah, man, we used to have fun.
<i>Best birthday ever.</i>

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.754
What the fuck happened?

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:26.680
<i>Okay.</i>

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.472
Oh, shit.
<i>Next.</i>

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.398
I think this is the day that
my mom gave me Maximus. Oh!

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:36.430
<i>This one is from
Owen and Lawrence.</i>

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.919
<i>A turtle!</i>

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.353
<i>- A turtle!
- Oh, my goodness!</i>

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:42.113
<i>Look, Mom, they got me a turtle!</i>

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.880
<i>- What do you say, sweetie?
- Thank you.</i>

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.918
<i>You're welcome.
You're welcome.</i>

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.600
<i>Honey,
what are you gonna name it?</i>

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.711
<i>I'm gonna name it Maximus.</i>

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:52.800
Get up. We're going out.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.274
What? Oh, no,
I'm not going out.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.999
I cannot deal with
the public right now.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.274
Conner, it's not a question.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.998
All right, fine,
but if we're going out,

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.275
I've got to put on my makeup.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.395
Please don't put that on.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.554
This is cool. It feels good to be out.
You were right.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.359
Good. Yeah, I'm glad I did this,
though, you know.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:23.194
Makes me feel more comfortable,
more at ease. I feel at ease.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.436
Yeah, you look really comfortable.
Yeah.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.988
You look like Matthew Modine
had a peanut allergy.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.080
All right.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.912
You look like Nazi propaganda.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.149
Okay, that's foul.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.679
Wait a minute.

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:05.640
Whoo!

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.148
That piano part is incredible.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.351
<i>Earth, wind, and birds</i>

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:22.070
<i>They fill my heart up
With darkness alone</i>

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.597
Was my last album bad?

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.790
I feel like I probably
could've handled myself

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.474
a little better over
the past few months.

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.515
It feels so nice to be
able to say all this shit

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.717
'cause the music is so
loud no one can hear me.

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.708
That <i>Equal Rights</i>
song was offensive!

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.273
I feel free!

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.918
Whoo!

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.316
Thanks for coming out, you guys.
Means a lot.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.277
Great show, Kid Contact.

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.434
Conner? Oh! Man!
How'd you recognize me?

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.120
What's up, man?
What are you doing here?

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.833
Had to put on the disguise, right?
Yeah. No, I see that.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.876
Come check out my
homie do his thing, man.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.797
Great show.
Thanks, man.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.108
Yeah. Yeah.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.269
Oh, Paula brought you?

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.194
She did, and I'm
really glad she did.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.953
It was such a great show.
You sounded incredible, dude.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:18.232
Thanks, man.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.436
I mean, my singing's
terrible, but, you know.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:23.353
What? No. No.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.032
I mean, all right, look,

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.560
maybe time for some vocal lessons,
you know. No shame in that.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.631
Yeah, or you know who
would sound better on it?

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.395
Clay Aiken.

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:32.833
No, you.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.478
No. No, man.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.791
This is your thing,
and I'm hella proud of you, man.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.314
And, fuck, man, I just...

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.709
I wanna just say I'm sorry.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.416
Conner, just... I... Like, I love
that you're doing this right now,

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.715
but it's really hard
to take you seriously

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.791
because you just look
like Jason Segel right now.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:51.880
Oh, Paula said that.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.200
We have great minds. Yeah.
Yeah.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.515
That's funny.
It must... Like, how does it look?

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.456
Oh, yeah, it's like the
spitting image of that guy.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.515
Is that good?

01:04:58.600 --> 01:04:59.736
It looks identical to that dude.

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:00.795
"Sarah Marshall."

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.359
"I need to forget
about her."

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.936
Yeah, he needs to forget her.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.313
I love that movie.
So good.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.031
Thanks, man. It means a
lot that you came out.

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.350
I'm glad I came, too.
For real.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.237
That's good, man.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:23.829
Nice.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.159
What the fuck?

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.037
One of you guys put this here?

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.195
Hey, Lawrence.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.479
Conner. Owen.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.354
Lawrence.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.514
Conner.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.475
I just...

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.271
That's for you, man,

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.713
to borrow, you know.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.216
I figured you could take a bunch of
pics of you holding it and stuff.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:02.992
You could post them or whatever.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:07.399
All right, so now we're cool.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.429
Lawrence!
What the fuck, man?

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.397
Now I've got to go find that.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.117
What do you want me to say?

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.696
That you helped with
the "catchphrase" verse?

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.039
Is that what
this is still about?

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.192
Fine, you helped with the
"catchphrase" verse, all right?

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.633
You happy?

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.150
All right, and you
wrote most of it,

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.071
but using my catchphrases

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.396
that you also co-wrote.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.990
All right, wrote, but we
were both in the room,

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.230
and I dictated
all the best stuff.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.152
All right, none of
the best stuff, dude,

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.037
but I had tons of great ideas

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.236
that I still don't even know
why you didn't use them.

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.838
Because they sucked!

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.957
Okay, fine.
That's my bad.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.837
But I was there
the whole time, man.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:59.718
I was a little late.
I was a little late that day.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.475
There was traffic, and I was a
little tardy on that particular day.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.357
There was no traffic.
I lied about that.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:09.592
I lied about it because I
overslept on accident.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:10.680
It was on purpose.

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.354
It was a power move. I was
trying to send a message,

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.749
and that was a dick move
on my part, all right?

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:20.516
However, once I got there,
late, I put in time, okay?

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.756
I left a little early.
I remember that.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.990
I was never there.
Now, I remember.

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.594
I remember now what happened!

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:30.114
I bailed and you
wrote the whole verse.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.476
You wrote it, and I never gave
you credit 'cause guess why?

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:34.959
No one cares who writes shit.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.712
They just care who performs it.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.633
In fact, I think the only
person in the whole universe

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.269
who cares about the credit
for who wrote it is you!

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:52.435
Fuck.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.113
I'm sorry.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.360
Boom!

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.955
<i>Parent Trap.</i>

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:26.075
What'd you say
you grew here again?

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:29.435
- You'll see.
- Oh, shit.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.636
Lawrence,
how much weed do you have?

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.633
<i>Hey, everyone, I'm gonna take the rest of
the day off to hang out with my friends.</i>

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.439
<i>Keep up the good work,
and let's have a great harvest.</i>

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:39.680
Okay.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.830
- You guys still smoke?
- Yeah.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.115
Cheers, dude.
Cheers.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.176
It's really up there, man.
Good shot there, Lawrence.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.600
All right, one, two, three.

01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.760
Oh!

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.154
- Got it?
- Get it.

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:03.715
Ah! Yeah. Yeah.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.755
Yeah.

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.113
No way this works.

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:09.475
Get it.
No.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.630
No.
Yeah.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.358
You smoked a Poppy, dude.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.435
What was that beat that we were
messing with once that was like...

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.238
Yeah.
What was that?

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.474
We should mess with that.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:40.077
That was it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
How did the lyrics go? What were the words?

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:44.749
<i>You are my number one pick</i>

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:46.068
We did it.
Yeah.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:50.591
<i>Every time I call you
You say that you're sick</i>

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.194
She was always sick.

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:53.429
Lawrence hooked up with her.

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.960
That's right.
You hooked up with her.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.275
Don't do me like that.
Come on, y'all.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:02.596
<i>Glenda, are you dying
Or just avoiding me</i>

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.120
That was it.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.830
<i>Either way's a bummer
But I hope you're dying</i>

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.080
That's what up.
He wrote that.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.440
<i>We had fun in there, man.
I forgot how fun it is.</i>

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Kind of makes me think
that I fucking hate farming.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.480
<i>I look at Conner,</i>

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.656
<i>and I see that seven-year-old
scrub that I grew up with,</i>

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.558
and it's like, how could you
be mad at a seven-year-old?

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.438
It's crazy I spent so much time
thinking about killing him.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.479
You guys see that?

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.153
You missed me.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.677
Oh, fuck.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.479
Conner's full of surprises
these days, man.

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:38.358
<i>I mean,
on our way from the airport,</i>

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.078
<i>I actually noticed
something crazy.</i>

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.957
<i>I looked down and in his bag,</i>

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.429
<i>he had this book called
How to Be a Better Friend.</i>

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.590
<i>It was all dog-eared
and scribbled on.</i>

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.711
It feels like
he's really trying,

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.560
and, plus, it shows he knows how to read,
which is really heartening.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.319
I can't believe
you remembered that, man.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.753
Paula's calling you.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.136
There was a whole
second verse to that.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.016
- Yeah, what was it, dude?
- Do you remember that?

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.720
I'm gonna grab it.
I'm gonna grab it. Okay.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.915
Yo.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.136
<i>Where the hell have you been?</i>

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.869
I'm hanging with the guys.
It's actually been super fun, man.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:11.799
<i>Conner, you just got
offered the Poppy Awards.</i>

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.635
Wait, what?

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:17.759
<i>The Poppy Awards.
Taylor Swift was arrested for murder.</i>

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.673
<i>They want you to close the show.
It is a huge slot.</i>

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:24.076
<i>Six minutes to do whatever you want,
but they need an answer now.</i>

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.556
Oh, shit. Um...

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.389
<i>This is what we've
been waiting for, Conner.</i>

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.597
She never wore socks

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.716
But that was
the third verse, though.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.936
I'm talking about
the second verse.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.136
Like what was the second verse?

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:41.233
<i>Her daddy hates me
'Cause my car is slick</i>

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.719
Yes!
Okay.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.234
Let's record it.
Hell, yeah.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.429
Let me get on the boards.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:46.720
What did Paula want, man?

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:50.070
Oh, nothing, they wanted me to do
the Pop Awards, but I passed on it.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:51.955
Yo, what?

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.336
Dude, I don't wanna do that shit.
I'm hanging with you guys.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.715
Who fucking cares, dude?
That's the Poppies.

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:57.994
All right, but I thought

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.913
this was, like, the whole reason
you guys were mad at me,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.230
for going and doing
all this solo shit.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.039
Dude, you don't have to choose
between us and your solo shit.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.873
It's like with Wu-Tang Clan.
It's like you're Method Man,

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.430
and he made a solo record,
but he's still in the Wu-Tang Clan.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.397
He never stopped
being in the Wu-Tang Clan.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.391
- Right.
- Or like the GZA.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:19.950
He was in the Wu-Tang Clan,
and then he made a solo record,

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.270
but he never stopped
being in the Wu-Tang Clan.

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.152
Yeah, or you're the RZA,

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.437
and you can do your solo shit, but
you're still in the Wu-Tang Clan.

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:30.997
So basically,
we're the Wu-Tang Clan.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.399
Exactly, but better.

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.480
Yeah.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.349
Well...

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.670
As soon as I said it,
I was kind of like, um, maybe not.

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.716
It's like we're
three Tom Pettys,

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.711
and we're the
Heartbreakers, you know.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.678
You're a Tom Petty,
you're a Tom Petty, and I'm Tom Petty,

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.428
but together we're the Heartbreakers...
We're Tom Petty.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.336
Oh, right, no. Yeah.
We're the Heartbreakers.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:50.496
- Yeah, I lost it, too.
- Yeah.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.795
We know you've got to fly.
You're like a beautiful bird.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.776
You've got to be out there.
You've got to see it all.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:57.553
But we can be right there with
you as your little bird legs.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.632
So you think I should
do the Pop Awards?

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:01.948
Fuck, yes.
Yeah.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.271
All right, well,
I'm not going alone.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.911
Who are you gonna do it with?
With you guys!

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.115
Do you wanna come with me?

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.776
Oh, sure, I was
wondering who you were...

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.240
Yeah, yeah. That's tight.
Hell, yeah!

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.520
We're so high.
Sorry.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:17.976
<i>And the stars are arriving</i>

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.992
<i>for this year's Pop Music Awards,
the Poppies.</i>

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.272
Good. Let's go.
You guys are all set.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.075
They know you're doing
one Style Boyz song,

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:31.152
and then we're gonna go
into Conner's new single.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:34.556
Great. Oh, shit! Conner,
what up, though, dawg?

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.193
Oh, yeah, what up, Hunter?

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.794
Yo, yo, yo. Say hey to
my doc real quick, baby.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.911
<i>Hi.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.594
You got a doc. I got a doc.
You know what I'm saying?

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:46.638
But now, like, I'm rolling

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:47.914
and with Aquaspin.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.389
Like, I kind of
Single-White-Femaled your ass.

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:51.708
<i>Yeah, man, that's crazy.</i>

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.677
Anyway, though,
good to see you, man.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.988
You looking spiffy, you know?

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.548
Yo, yo, it's Hunter, dawg, about
to get crazy on the stage...

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.438
No, sorry, not your camera.
We're with Conner.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.589
Oh, shit. My bad.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.376
Yo, this is Hunter about to head into
the Poppies. You know what I'm saying?

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.776
No, sorry, we're with Snoop.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.233
Surprise, mothafucka.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.478

mothafucka, you been surprised.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.954
Excuse me.
Can somebody move?

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:26.719
<i>Mariah Carey, your
hair smells and looks great.</i>

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:30.549
<i>Did you know Aquaspin has
hair dryers and flat irons?</i>

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.856
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:35.668
<i>Aquaspin appliances are completely
affordable for college students.</i>

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.910
<i>Honey, you're not
doing ads now. Really?</i>

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.696
<i>Read the damn prompter, yo.
You messing with my money right now.</i>

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.520
<i>What the did you
just say to me? What?</i>

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:45.757
<i>- Yo all y'all, all right?

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.796

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.353
<i>Yeah, I said her. No...</i>

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.336
<i>Oh, you still here?
I thought you had left. Okay, sweetie...</i>

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.999
Style Boyz.
It's time.

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.736
Yo, what the fuck
was that, everybody?

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.796
Why you got me up there
saying that bullshit, man?

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:00.912
I told you not to say it. You're the
one that wanted to cash the check.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.071
Dude, you set me up, dude!

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:05.151
You ain't nothing
but like a fake sellout

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.993
money hungry pop
bullshit-ass manager.

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.440
You ain't nothing but a Tony!
Toni! Total reject, bitch!

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.914
What the fuck you say to me?

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.797
Say that shit again,
young blood.

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:18.477
I will eat your head!
I will eat your fucking head!

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.232
You better learn some respect.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:24.559
Yo, all right.
Man, I'm sorry, yo. Chill.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.319
Old-ass motherfucker.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.673
Why you hit me like that, dawg?

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.432
Get yourself a new manager.

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.113
Yo, are you serious?

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.429
Damn, man.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.758
Oh, my God.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.035
That was great, Harry.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.235
It was insane, wasn't it?

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.355
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:45.238
I was like, "Get some respect,"
you know?

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:46.560
Wow!

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:50.516
Hey, look, Harry,
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:52.477
No, don't.
Don't worry about it.

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.198
Just get out there and have a good time.
Good luck, guys.

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:57.576
Thanks, Harry.
Thanks, Harry.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.635
Yeah.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:05.439
Okay, this is it.
You nervous?

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.193
Just a little bit.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.551
Don't be. We got this.

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.896
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
All right, see you out there.

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.512
See you out there.

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.635
<i>Please take your seats.</i>

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:15.960
Oh, God, Conner, there you are.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.353
Look, the show's going way over,

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.800
so you only have
three minutes now.

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:20.751
What? Yeah, you can
only do one song,

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.752
so I need to know are you gonna
do Conner4Real or Style Boyz?

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:24.840
Uh...

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.838
Yeah. No, I asked him.

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.195
He's just kind of, like,
looking off into space

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.510
and, like, really
making a meal out of this.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.352
And now I'm just
standing here waiting.

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:38.433
He's looking off to, like,
contemplate whether he should,

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:42.195
I think, pick the Style Boyz, 'cause
he's, like, looking in their direction,

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:45.556
so we might be leaning
toward that kind of...

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:46.675
No, he's looking back.

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:49.558
So I'm lost. I'm not sure
which one he's gonna go for.

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.473
All right, I know
what I'm gonna do.

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.674
<i>Our final performer tonight is a
living legend and still a superstar.</i>

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.796
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the one and only Conner4Real.</i>

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.113
<i>Finest girl I
ever met In my whole life</i>

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.794
<i>Wanna take her home
Make her my wife</i>

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:16.793
<i>Knew she was a freak
When she started talking</i>

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.480
<i>She said</i>

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.391
<i>I'm a Style Boy for life</i>

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.400
Should we tell them?
Yeah.

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:27.629
T ell them, man.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:29.153
We made a new song at the farm.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:32.949
Yeah, we found Lawrence's journals,
and they were just amazing.

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.349
Amazing. Just full of
incredible thoughts.

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:38.398
Just like ideas and poems and stuff.
Nothing special.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.993
Yo, and then Conner had the idea

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.196
to take a piano line
from my solo shit.

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.360
Conner put it all together.

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:47.075
And the Poppies paired us with the
craziest special guest to perform with.

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.830
<i>Incredible thoughts</i>

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.475

<i>How did my brain conceive them</i>

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.075

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:54.752
Kid Contact, Kid Brain, and
Kid Conner all back together,

the motherfucking Style Boyz.

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.956
This is just some
revolutionary shit, man.

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.519

01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:59.520
<i>How did my brain conceive them</i>

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.031
Yes! Yes! Fuck!

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.509
Whoo! Yes.

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:15.878
I just performed the Donkey
Roll with the Style Boyz.

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.154
I was a Style Boy.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.353
<i>When I walked out onstage,</i>

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.512
all I could think of was,
"I'm so happy.

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:28.037
"And I really hope that Tony! Toni! Tone!
Is watching,

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.473
"and that they
feel like shit."

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.835
<i>A wise man once said,
everyone's career is on a wave.</i>

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:35.753
<i>Sometimes, you're up.</i>

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.271
<i>Sometimes, you're down.</i>

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:41.830
<i>But the trick is not to lose
yourself along the way.</i>

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:44.832
<i>And when you're up,
don't be an asshole about it.</i>

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.153
<i>It's like my mom always says...
Yo, what the fuck?</i>

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:52.156
<i>That stage manager lady just
macked on Lawrence super hard.</i>

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.471
<i>Yo, do they even know each other?
Oh, my God!</i>

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.152
<i>And why is "Deboarrah" here?</i>

01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:00.750
<i>Anyways, be cool to your friends, right?
That's what I was saying.</i>

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:03.912
<i>Yo, they are gonna fuck.
Damn, that is hilarious.</i>

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.514
<i>But the point is,
be a good person.</i>

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.352
<i>The rest will fall into place.</i>

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.158
And that's Conner4Real.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.310
Isn't that right, Maximus 2?

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.757
It sure is, Conner.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.752
What?

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:24.228
He wasn't really talking.
That was me doing the voice.

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:18.679
The Style Boyz are getting
back together again.

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:22.960
Yeah, they broke up.
Then they buried the hatchet,

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.554
and now I guess they're
working together again.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:28.152
They're like friends
from childhood.

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:29.240
Yeah.
For life.

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.639
And they had, like, tough times

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:33.075
and now they feel good
about being back together.

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.071
"We're gonna put
aside our differences."

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.751
They actually do something.

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:40.354
Sometimes, I think about doing that.
Yeah.

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.749
I haven't talked to
my mom in three years.

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:47.030
I moved out here. I thought I could
get like a commercial agent.

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.236
I just wanted to be
a longboard model.

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.753
I never graduated high school.

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.117
I never graduated middle school.

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:55.920
It'd be a lot of
fun if the four of us

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.518
hung out outside of the office.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.197
Hey guys, can I ask you
something really...

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.077
That I've never really
asked you before?

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:04.789
Yeah.

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.416
Do you guys have a photograph
of James Franco leaving a Denny's?

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.936
Oh yeah, totally!
It's right here! Fuck, yeah!

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.916
Let's see it.
Put it up.

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.394
Bring it up.
We got it.

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.836
<i>Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah</i>

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.271
<i>Words and truth</i>

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:27.111
<i>One fine evening
on the sandy coast</i>

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:30.397
<i>The feeling was irey
'round the drum circle</i>

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.790
<i>When the wisest rasta I ever saw</i>

01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:37.556
<i>Gently joined us and sang of Jah</i>

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.996
<i>Roots and culture
seeped from his bones</i>

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:44.629
<i>He took out a spliff and said,
"Pass this around"</i>

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.798
<i>So I took a righteous drag</i>

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:51.111
<i>It was the best sensi
that I ever had</i>

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.510
<i>And then I felt the chills
run up my back</i>

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:57.831
<i>"My good man,
tell me, what was that?"</i>

01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:01.556
<i>He said, "My friend,
you just smoked crack"</i>

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:05.311
<i>"You just smoked crack"</i>

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.519
<i>Oh, crack</i>

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.557
<i>I just smoked crack Oh, my God</i>

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.392
<i>And it felt fucking great</i>

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.879
<i>This feels amazing</i>

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.272
<i>Thought it was marijuana
Oh, yeah</i>

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:23.351
<i>But now it's too fucking late</i>

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.839
<i>I can't go back</i>

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:28.356
<i>I love crack Holy shit</i>

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.431
<i>Now I am invincible</i>

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.560
<i>Fuck, yeah</i>

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:34.996
<i>If anyone tries to take my crack</i>

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.275
<i>I'll kill them on principle</i>

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:41.548
<i>Some call crack bazooka</i>

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.715
<i>Others call it base</i>

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.998
<i>But no matter
what name you call it</i>

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:51.836
<i>It's the best invention ever
by the human race</i>

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:56.031
<i>The government
spread lies about it</i>

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.635
<i>They say that it is no fun</i>

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:02.395
<i>But on that plastic shell
I sucky</i>

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:05.472
<i>Sucky, sucky, sucky
till the crack is gone</i>

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:09.553
<i>Now we should legalize it</i>

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:12.919
<i>Legalize it</i>

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:16.598
<i>Set the people free</i>

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.553
<i>And legalize</i>

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:22.712
<i>We should legalize crack</i>

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:24.998
<i>So that I can smoke it all</i>
