WEBVTT

00:04.610 --> 00:07.810
‐ Ugh, I can’t believe Arthur
made me go to a high school gym

00:07.810 --> 00:11.410
to watch NPR play PBS
in a game of sports ball.

00:13.176 --> 00:14.710
‐ Oh, God!

00:14.710 --> 00:16.610
‐ Spread it out, guys!
Spread it out!

00:16.610 --> 00:18.843
Let’s do this.

00:18.843 --> 00:21.160
‐ This is bringing back memories
of my high school experience.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.062
I used to hear the fags
were giving hand jobs

00:23.062 --> 00:24.863
under the bleachers,
and I was like, "Ugh,"

00:24.863 --> 00:26.798
and then I’d go wait there
after school every day.

00:26.798 --> 00:29.534
‐ Let’s do this!
‐ Good. Bring it on.

00:29.534 --> 00:30.000
‐ Sorry.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.534
‐ Sorry.

00:30.534 --> 00:31.735
‐ Foul!

00:31.735 --> 00:33.337
Too slow
to be considered running.

00:33.337 --> 00:34.704
‐ Oh, for Pete’s sake.

00:34.704 --> 00:35.939
‐ PBS, you’re gonna
lose this game

00:35.939 --> 00:37.773
like you lost
"Sesame Street."

00:37.773 --> 00:39.508
Suck this American dick.

00:39.508 --> 00:41.176
‐ Bring it on.
Bring it on.

00:41.176 --> 00:42.510
‐ I will. I shall.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.045
Maybe this one.
"Catalog‐a‐holic.

00:44.045 --> 00:46.213
How hoarding catalogs
eventually brought me to AA."

00:46.213 --> 00:47.748
‐ Ooh, and that’s
a one‐woman show?

00:47.748 --> 00:49.250
‐ It’s in the cabaret section.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.017
‐ I think we can find worse.

00:51.017 --> 00:52.485
‐ It’s gonna be hard to top
last year’s lady ventriloquist

00:52.485 --> 00:53.753
singing about her abortions

00:53.753 --> 00:55.220
in the style
of Gilbert and Sullivan.

00:55.220 --> 00:57.589
‐ Those were wordy abortions.

00:57.589 --> 00:59.924
‐ Ooh, looks like DeNeil Tinder

00:59.924 --> 01:00.000
is making a little visit
to New York.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.459
is making a little visit
to New York.

01:01.459 --> 01:04.194
‐ I have been hearing
about DeNeil Tinder for a month.

01:04.194 --> 01:05.629
Are you two ever gonna meet?

01:05.629 --> 01:07.130
‐ Are you out of your mind?

01:07.130 --> 01:10.066
I’ve got DeNeil Tinder,
Allen Grindr, Max Scruff.

01:10.066 --> 01:12.634
All these app guys I know
who know so much about me

01:12.634 --> 01:14.936
will be staying in my phone,
thank you.

01:14.936 --> 01:16.437
‐ Arthur!

01:16.437 --> 01:17.572
‐ Nice D, Chester.

01:17.572 --> 01:19.374
‐ Sorry.
‐ Listen to this.

01:19.374 --> 01:20.775
It sounds horrible.

01:20.775 --> 01:22.676
"Searching for My Jake Ryan:

01:22.676 --> 01:25.612
"How My 16‐Year‐Old Boyfriend
Ruined My Life.

01:25.612 --> 01:27.246
A Journey in Song."

01:27.246 --> 01:29.415
‐ That’s the worst cabaret show
in Manhattan.

01:29.415 --> 01:30.000
‐ Now we have plans for
the night before my birthday.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.950
‐ Now we have plans for
the night before my birthday.

01:31.950 --> 01:34.452
‐ I love our tradition
of celebrating the night before.

01:34.452 --> 01:36.721
‐ Yeah, ’cause the actual day
always shits the bed.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.355
‐ What was the worst birthday
you ever had?

01:38.355 --> 01:39.856
‐ That’s like asking me

01:39.856 --> 01:42.225
which Bill Lawrence show
do I find most contrived.

01:42.225 --> 01:43.559
It’s a tie for last.

01:43.559 --> 01:45.160
Honestly, at this point,
the only thing my mother

01:45.160 --> 01:47.830
hasn’t done to ruin my birthday
is actually forget it,

01:47.830 --> 01:49.064
like in "Sixteen Candles."

01:49.064 --> 01:50.599
‐ There’s still time.
‐ Mm.

01:50.599 --> 01:52.066
‐ Go for it, Arthur.
‐ He’s gonna‐‐

01:52.066 --> 01:53.267
‐ Gah!

01:56.303 --> 01:58.771
‐ You scored the winning... goal!

01:58.771 --> 02:00.000
‐ Home run!
‐ Touchdown!

02:00.000 --> 02:00.206
‐ Home run!
‐ Touchdown!

02:00.206 --> 02:02.141
Touchdown!
We won!

02:05.010 --> 02:06.778
‐ Let me guess,
room temp Chamomile?

02:06.778 --> 02:08.746
‐ Oh, yeah.
You know they save the Earl Grey

02:08.746 --> 02:10.114
for the championship.

02:12.349 --> 02:14.518
‐ Are you all turned on
watching your boyfriend score

02:14.518 --> 02:16.385
the winning point?
‐ Oh, yeah.

02:16.385 --> 02:20.188
From the waist down,
I’m a friggin’ lake.

02:24.726 --> 02:27.328
‐ Nice trophy, bro!
‐ Oh, thank you, stranger.

02:27.328 --> 02:29.130
‐ Hey, do you guys
want to get some dinner?

02:29.130 --> 02:30.000
I think Giuliana Rancic’s
new restaurant is nearby.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.097
I think Giuliana Rancic’s
new restaurant is nearby.

02:31.097 --> 02:33.366
They serve ice, water,
steam, and rain.

02:33.366 --> 02:34.967
‐ Oh, my God.
I wish.

02:34.967 --> 02:37.970
I have to go home and recap
A Family Affair,"

02:37.970 --> 02:39.671
although I might end up
just splitting the difference

02:39.671 --> 02:41.005
and putting my head
in the oven.

02:41.005 --> 02:41.940
‐

02:41.940 --> 02:43.307
‐ Why not try DeNeil Tinder?

02:43.307 --> 02:45.476
‐ He’s still in Atlanta,
which I know

02:45.476 --> 02:47.645
because we text each other
every single night,

02:47.645 --> 02:49.146
even though we’ve never met.

02:49.146 --> 02:51.981
‐ Right now you have two groups
of guys in your life.

02:51.981 --> 02:54.350
Men who you know intimately
from your phone,

02:54.350 --> 02:56.485
and guys that you have
anonymous sex with.

02:56.485 --> 02:58.086
‐ Yes.
‐ So what I am pitching is

02:58.086 --> 03:00.000
maybe there’s
an overlapping part

03:00.000 --> 03:00.655
maybe there’s
an overlapping part

03:00.655 --> 03:02.857
of the Venn diagram
we can explore.

03:02.857 --> 03:05.325
‐ I guess DeNeil Tinder
isn’t in New York a lot,

03:05.325 --> 03:08.794
so even if we meet
and it is a disaster,

03:08.794 --> 03:10.196
he won’t be hanging around
a long time

03:10.196 --> 03:11.830
to remind me
it’s a disaster,

03:11.830 --> 03:13.265
the way you sometimes
still see posters

03:13.265 --> 03:14.366
for that movie "Burnt."

03:14.366 --> 03:16.568
‐ Exactly,
so you have nothing to lose.

03:16.568 --> 03:18.069
What if it actually works out?

03:18.069 --> 03:19.903
And promise me,
when it does,

03:19.903 --> 03:21.605
you’ll never take him
for granted.

03:21.605 --> 03:24.674
‐ Duct Tape, men I’ve never met
are showing camaraderie!

03:24.674 --> 03:25.675
‐ Arthur, please.

03:25.675 --> 03:27.543
The soul mates are talking.

03:27.543 --> 03:29.111
‐ Why didn’t "Burnt" work?

03:29.111 --> 03:30.000
‐ I have no idea.
‐ We’ve never figured that out.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.579
‐ I have no idea.
‐ We’ve never figured that out.

03:30.579 --> 03:31.580
‐ I can’t think
of a single reason.

03:31.580 --> 03:32.947
That’s the problem.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.817
‐ Remember,
it’s your birthday lunch,

03:36.817 --> 03:38.185
so you can have dessert,

03:38.185 --> 03:39.486
but let’s get rid
of the bread basket

03:39.486 --> 03:40.720
to even it out.
There you go.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.088
We don’t want that.
Thank you.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.289
‐ Why do we have to go
to your country club

03:43.289 --> 03:44.923
for my birthday lunch?

03:44.923 --> 03:46.091
Now all of your friends
are gonna stop by

03:46.091 --> 03:47.859
and schmooze you
and ignore me.

03:47.859 --> 03:49.127
‐ Okay, you know what
I want to hear?

03:49.127 --> 03:51.095
One thing
that you are grateful for.

03:51.095 --> 03:53.297
‐ I’m grateful it’s not
my 11th birthday dinner.

03:53.297 --> 03:55.399
Remember when you abandoned me
at that restaurant?

03:55.399 --> 03:56.633
‐ This again.

03:56.633 --> 03:58.534
Julie, it was, what,
25 years ago?

03:58.534 --> 04:00.000
Come on. Move on.
Get over it.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.636
Come on. Move on.
Get over it.

04:00.636 --> 04:02.304
‐ Nothing you just said
is an apology

04:02.304 --> 04:05.373
or even an acknowledgement
of how bad you made me feel.

04:05.373 --> 04:07.875
I mean, you left me alone
in a restaurant!

04:07.875 --> 04:10.911
‐ I did not get far
before I came back to get you.

04:10.911 --> 04:12.012
‐ How was I supposed
to know that?

04:12.012 --> 04:13.379
I thought you’d left forever.

04:13.379 --> 04:14.915
‐ Well, I hadn’t
and I’m still here.

04:14.915 --> 04:16.115
Look who’s here.
Fred and Helen. Hello.

04:16.115 --> 04:17.349
‐ Hello!
‐ Marilyn, how are you?

04:17.349 --> 04:19.218
‐ To what do we owe
the pleasure?

04:19.218 --> 04:21.586
‐ I’m celebrating
the 36th anniversary

04:21.586 --> 04:25.756
of the day I survived 2 1/2 days
of excruciating labor.

04:25.756 --> 04:27.491
‐ You two should come
by the spa later.

04:27.491 --> 04:29.759
I’ll give you a mother‐daughter
birthday special.

04:29.759 --> 04:30.000
My treat.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.960
My treat.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.228
‐ Well, that is
so generous of you!

04:32.228 --> 04:35.297
Mr. Harris owns
the spa in Tribeca.

04:35.297 --> 04:36.532
‐ Thank you very much.

04:36.532 --> 04:37.899
‐ You’re quite welcome.
‐ Many happy returns.

04:37.899 --> 04:40.301
‐ Happy birthday.
‐ Thanks.

04:40.301 --> 04:41.702
‐ "And thank you, Mom,

04:41.702 --> 04:44.104
"if you hadn’t been kind enough
to ask me to the club,

04:44.104 --> 04:45.572
we wouldn’t have
a spa day."

04:45.572 --> 04:47.341
‐ I hate it when you put words
in my mouth, okay?

04:47.341 --> 04:49.308
I would never say that.
‐ No, of course you wouldn’t,

04:49.308 --> 04:51.044
because it would kill you
to give me a compliment.

04:51.044 --> 04:52.278
‐ Well, I would,
but you’re so busy

04:52.278 --> 04:53.979
giving them to yourself
all the time.

04:53.979 --> 04:56.614
‐ Okay, because somebody
has to worry about my feelings.

04:56.614 --> 04:58.115
‐ What about my feelings?

04:58.115 --> 04:59.716
You never take responsibility
for how you affect them!

04:59.716 --> 05:00.000
‐ Oh, if this about goddamn
Benihana again‐‐

05:00.000 --> 05:01.952
‐ Oh, if this about goddamn
Benihana again‐‐

05:01.952 --> 05:03.286
‐ It is about goddamn Benihana
again.

05:03.286 --> 05:04.354
‐ Oh, stop it, Julie.

05:04.354 --> 05:05.989
‐ And it’s about
my bat mitzvah...

05:05.989 --> 05:07.457
‐ Oh, please.
‐ The theme of which was "Moms,"

05:07.457 --> 05:08.791
on your insistence.

05:08.791 --> 05:10.292
‐ You chose that theme yourself.
‐ I did not.

05:10.292 --> 05:12.994
‐ And you got to sit
at the Peg Bundy table!

05:12.994 --> 05:15.263
‐ I thought it was Kate Pierson
from the B‐52s!

05:15.263 --> 05:16.397
‐ Excuse me, sir.

05:16.397 --> 05:18.431
You know, I changed my mind
about the bread.

05:19.967 --> 05:21.534
‐ Billy, don’t take off
your coat.

05:21.534 --> 05:23.803
You have more deliveries.
‐ No, that’s not fair.

05:23.803 --> 05:25.571
How come Matthew never
has to make a delivery?

05:25.571 --> 05:27.005
‐ Oh, "Boo‐hoo.

05:27.005 --> 05:29.140
"I was in ’The Seagull’
at Northwestern.

05:29.140 --> 05:30.000
Now I deliver
cheeseburgers."

05:30.000 --> 05:31.076
Now I deliver
cheeseburgers."

05:31.076 --> 05:32.743
Suck it up, sideburns!

05:32.743 --> 05:34.478
‐ But I’m finally meeting
that guy from Tinder tonight.

05:34.478 --> 05:36.013
I can’t be late.

05:36.013 --> 05:38.047
How come this place can’t be
more like "Ratatouille"?

05:38.047 --> 05:40.449
‐ We all got troubles.

05:40.449 --> 05:42.651
My favorite piano key scarf,

05:42.651 --> 05:44.119
ruined by my dry cleaner.

05:44.119 --> 05:45.988
‐ You make me want
to forgive Eddie Murphy

05:45.988 --> 05:47.655
for everything he’s ever said.

05:47.655 --> 05:49.223
‐ Speak of the devil.

05:49.223 --> 05:50.858
Eddie, I told you I’m not
speaking to you again

05:50.858 --> 05:53.326
until you pay me
that thousand bucks you owe me.

05:53.326 --> 05:56.162
‐ Wait, are you the one
from the story?

05:56.162 --> 05:59.431
‐ No, the one died
under mysterious circumstances,

05:59.431 --> 06:00.000
God rest her soul.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.732
God rest her soul.

06:00.732 --> 06:02.567
No, I’m the asshole
that sold him a flat screen TV

06:02.567 --> 06:04.002
he still hasn’t paid for.

06:05.303 --> 06:08.372
‐ I guess it’s easier
to accept a free spa day

06:08.372 --> 06:10.773
than it is to give
your mother a compliment.

06:10.773 --> 06:12.575
‐ Can we not talk, please?

06:12.575 --> 06:13.976
‐ I am so sorry,

06:13.976 --> 06:15.411
but it’s gonna be
a little while longer.

06:15.411 --> 06:17.313
Chloeë Sevigny rented out
all the treatment rooms

06:17.313 --> 06:19.014
and is taking
longer than expected.

06:19.014 --> 06:20.315
‐ Why does she need
all the rooms?

06:20.315 --> 06:21.982
‐ Oh, she’s treating
the whole cast

06:21.982 --> 06:23.951
Hotel" to a wrap gift.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.352
It’s for their PTSD.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.987
‐ Is Gaga here?
‐ Oh, I’m afraid not.

06:27.987 --> 06:30.000
She was supposed to be on tour
with Tony Bennett,

06:30.000 --> 06:30.056
She was supposed to be on tour
with Tony Bennett,

06:30.056 --> 06:32.491
but she’s being detained
in China for elder abuse.

06:32.491 --> 06:35.327
Can I bring you
some complimentary champagne

06:35.327 --> 06:36.328
while you wait?

06:36.328 --> 06:38.263
‐ Yes.

06:40.297 --> 06:42.499
Oh, my.

06:42.499 --> 06:44.000
What’s the average IQ

06:44.000 --> 06:46.102
of a woman
who reads these things?

06:46.102 --> 06:48.938
‐ Oy! Me and me mom
need more champers!

06:48.938 --> 06:51.506
‐ Look at this.
"Dear advice lady.

06:51.506 --> 06:54.075
"I’ve never looked
at my own vagina.

06:54.075 --> 06:55.977
"Should I squat
over a hand mirror

06:55.977 --> 06:58.579
or hire
a caricature artist?"

06:58.579 --> 07:00.000
‐ A caricature artist.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.113
‐ A caricature artist.

07:00.113 --> 07:02.649
That way you can count
all the "NINAs."

07:10.656 --> 07:12.090
‐ Gaga!

07:13.224 --> 07:15.292
DeNeil Tinder,
at long last.

07:15.292 --> 07:18.562
Billy Tinder.

07:18.562 --> 07:21.064
So, huh.

07:21.064 --> 07:23.232
‐ This apartment is huge.
‐ Yes.

07:23.232 --> 07:24.933
‐ Your sister
must be doing well.

07:24.933 --> 07:27.002
‐ Oh, she’s doing really well
for herself.

07:27.002 --> 07:28.570
‐ You know what’s strange
is that, you know,

07:28.570 --> 07:30.000
normally on a first date,
you could just make

07:30.000 --> 07:30.337
normally on a first date,
you could just make

07:30.337 --> 07:32.606
this, like, meaningless bullshit
small talk,

07:32.606 --> 07:33.940
but you know me
too well now

07:33.940 --> 07:35.241
’cause we’ve been texting
forever,

07:35.241 --> 07:37.177
so you know
that I don’t give a shit

07:37.177 --> 07:39.078
how your flight was,
and I don’t give a shit

07:39.078 --> 07:40.345
what the weather’s like
in Atlanta.

07:40.345 --> 07:41.847
‐ Yeah, and you know me
well enough

07:41.847 --> 07:43.715
to know that
my whole homo‐thug routine

07:43.715 --> 07:45.016
for quick sex
is bullshit.

07:45.016 --> 07:49.420
‐ Right.
So, no small talk.

07:49.420 --> 07:50.721
What do we do?

07:50.721 --> 07:52.989
‐ Well, if we didn’t know
each other so well,

07:52.989 --> 07:55.525
what would we do?

07:55.525 --> 07:59.295
‐ Sex with a guy
you really know, not so bad.

07:59.295 --> 08:00.000
‐ Yeah.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.562
‐ Yeah.

08:00.562 --> 08:01.997
Who knew?

08:01.997 --> 08:03.898
‐ Certainly not
David Duchovny.

08:03.898 --> 08:05.866
‐ Can I offer you
something to drink?

08:05.866 --> 08:09.135
‐ No.
I think I’m fine.

08:09.135 --> 08:11.370
God, your sister
has a beautiful place.

08:11.370 --> 08:14.039
‐ Yeah. She and her husband
have their own business.

08:14.039 --> 08:16.408
It’s a café.

08:16.408 --> 08:17.575
‐ Oh, my God.

08:19.544 --> 08:22.914
‐  She’s all alone.
‐ I can’t believe‐‐

08:22.914 --> 08:24.848
‐ Oh, God‐‐
Oh, God!

08:28.851 --> 08:30.986
‐ Denise is his sister?

08:30.986 --> 08:32.354
Holy shit!

08:32.354 --> 08:33.655
‐ I know.

08:33.655 --> 08:35.857
It’s the weirdest thing
that’s ever happened!

08:35.857 --> 08:37.357
And of course the one time

08:37.357 --> 08:39.092
I try combining
sex and intimacy,

08:39.092 --> 08:40.994
I end up shitting
where I eat.

08:40.994 --> 08:43.063
Eating where I fuck?
Fucking where I shit?

08:43.063 --> 08:44.096
‐ Dealer’s choice.

08:44.096 --> 08:45.865
What did she say?

08:45.865 --> 08:48.067
‐ Oh, it was also so weird.

08:48.067 --> 08:52.003
She was nice,
and I was confused,

08:52.003 --> 08:53.938
DeNeil was confused,
and then she ended up

08:53.938 --> 08:55.606
inviting me
to a family dinner tomorrow.

08:55.606 --> 08:56.631
‐ Do you want me to call
and say your dad died again?

08:56.631 --> 08:57.842
‐ Do you want me to call
and say your dad died again?

08:57.842 --> 09:01.144
‐  No!
I don’t know what to do.

09:01.144 --> 09:02.411
I can’t just dump him

09:02.411 --> 09:04.080
because Denise hates me
enough as it is,

09:04.080 --> 09:06.114
and I can’t ghost him,
though I usually would,

09:06.114 --> 09:07.983
because DeNeil knows me
well enough to know

09:07.983 --> 09:09.751
that’s what I do
when I feel overwhelmed.

09:09.751 --> 09:11.986
‐ Is there any universe
in which you’d consider

09:11.986 --> 09:13.720
just being yourself?

09:13.720 --> 09:14.821
‐ Are you insane?

09:14.821 --> 09:16.890
No.
I can’t be myself.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.058
I don’t know how to be
with a guy

09:18.058 --> 09:19.259
and try to connect
with his family.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.060
I don’t know
how to do that.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.628
‐ What if you
Sharon Stone it?

09:23.628 --> 09:26.230
‐ Sharon Stoning it, yes!

09:26.230 --> 09:26.631
‐ Remember what she said,

09:26.631 --> 09:27.766
‐ Remember what she said,

09:27.766 --> 09:29.933
"If you’re having a hard time
acting an emotion,

09:29.933 --> 09:33.203
just make the facial expression
and the emotion will follow."

09:33.203 --> 09:34.471
‐ There’s a reason
she’s in Mensa.

09:34.471 --> 09:36.372
‐ She was never in Mensa.
‐ I know,

09:36.372 --> 09:38.040
but she said
she was in Mensa,

09:38.040 --> 09:40.709
so she should be in Mensa.
‐ I love her.

09:40.709 --> 09:42.310
‐ I’ll go in there
and make my face look

09:42.310 --> 09:43.678
like I’m enjoying
something painful

09:43.678 --> 09:45.546
until I’m actually
having a good time.

09:45.546 --> 09:47.647
‐ I bet that’s how she got
through "Basic Instinct 2."

09:47.647 --> 09:49.083
‐ Me too.
All right,

09:49.083 --> 09:50.750
night‐before‐birthday girl,
more importantly,

09:50.750 --> 09:52.451
are you ready
for the worst night of theater

09:52.451 --> 09:54.820
since Bruce Willis wore
an ear piece in "Misery"

09:54.820 --> 09:56.631
and still forgot
all his lines?

09:56.631 --> 09:57.455
and still forgot
all his lines?

09:57.455 --> 10:00.558
‐ Whoo!
Sports.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.726
Mm.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.627
Hey, Fraternity Paddle,
you’re back. Good.

10:03.627 --> 10:06.397
Hey, hand me the "Sports
Illustrated" swimsuit issue.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.932
I want to use it as a coaster
for my new brewski.

10:08.932 --> 10:10.733
‐ Jesus Christ, Arthur.

10:10.733 --> 10:12.201
Enough.
We get it.

10:12.201 --> 10:13.802
You scored a goal
or whatever.

10:13.802 --> 10:16.371
That doesn’t mean you can not
ask me about my night.

10:16.371 --> 10:19.573
‐ Hey, I’m watching the game.
I’m a man.

10:19.573 --> 10:21.041
‐ You’re not acting
like a man.

10:21.041 --> 10:22.275
You’re acting
like a bro, okay,

10:22.275 --> 10:23.911
and if I wanted to be
with a bro,

10:23.911 --> 10:25.678
I would have blown Doug Ellin
at the bathroom at the Standard

10:25.678 --> 10:26.631
the night Billy and I crashed
that "Entourage" party.

10:26.631 --> 10:28.180
the night Billy and I crashed
that "Entourage" party.

10:28.180 --> 10:30.149
‐ Quit riding me, woman!

10:30.149 --> 10:32.483
I’m going into my man‐cave.

10:32.483 --> 10:34.419
Ahh.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.092
‐ I don’t understand.
Are you mad at me?

10:43.092 --> 10:45.261
Why am I doing deliveries?
Why isn’t Billy?

10:45.261 --> 10:46.762
‐ Because Billy is joining
DeNeil and I

10:46.762 --> 10:49.331
for our family dinner
with my aunt tonight.

10:49.331 --> 10:52.834
‐ Wait, so Billy is meeting
Aunt Sam before I get to?

10:52.834 --> 10:54.035
What’s happening?

10:54.035 --> 10:55.769
Okay, down’s up,
cats are dogs,

10:55.769 --> 10:56.631
what, Patti LuPone suddenly
doesn’t hate Bernadette Peters?

10:56.631 --> 10:58.371
what, Patti LuPone suddenly
doesn’t hate Bernadette Peters?

10:58.371 --> 11:00.840
‐ Hey!
I assure you,

11:00.840 --> 11:04.076
Patti still really fucking
hates Bernadette Peters.

11:04.076 --> 11:07.045
There’s a reason
for this dinner, okay?

11:07.045 --> 11:09.480
My aunts are bitches.
They hate everybody.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.549
They’ll tear Billy to shreds.

11:11.549 --> 11:13.817
Then Billy will dump DeNeil,
and that way

11:13.817 --> 11:16.118
my brother won’t hate me,
’cause I’m not the bad guy.

11:16.118 --> 11:18.220
My aunts are the bad guy!

11:18.220 --> 11:22.458
‐ Oh, Mama, you are
as smart as Sharon Stone.

11:30.730 --> 11:32.198
Hey, let go!

11:32.198 --> 11:33.633
Hey!
Oh, my God!

11:33.633 --> 11:35.034
Let go! Let go!

11:36.569 --> 11:39.071
What’s happening?
What’s happening?

11:42.139 --> 11:45.042
‐ So that’s when Arthur
was like, "Oh, my.

11:45.042 --> 11:47.243
Uh, hold it right there,
Hockey Puck."

11:47.243 --> 11:49.445
‐ He did not.
‐ He fucking did.

11:50.813 --> 11:52.748
Spit it out, Mom!

11:52.748 --> 11:54.149
‐ I love you.

11:54.149 --> 11:56.151
‐ Really?
‐ Sort of.

11:58.219 --> 11:59.753
‐ All right, folks.

11:59.753 --> 12:02.155
It’s 11:00 p. m.,
and you know what that means.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.223
Time for karaoke!

12:03.223 --> 12:05.358
‐ Ohh.
‐ Boo!

12:05.358 --> 12:08.595
‐ I swear, New York is becoming
the worst suburb, you know?

12:08.595 --> 12:09.962
‐ I hate‐‐I hate it.

You’ve been wonderful.

12:36.817 --> 12:40.120
So we’re just gonna
bring it down just a little bit.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.154
‐ Excuse me.
You have been up there forever.

12:42.154 --> 12:44.089
‐ Oh, I’m sorry.
I’m‐‐let me guess.

12:44.089 --> 12:45.390
You guys are from Tisch?

12:45.390 --> 12:48.026
You musical theater students
from NYU?

12:48.026 --> 12:50.028
‐ Yeah.
‐ We took a vote,

12:50.028 --> 12:52.129
and nobody likes you.

12:52.129 --> 12:53.597
‐ You’re gonna do the thing
at karaoke

12:53.597 --> 12:56.133
where you pretend to be
worse singers than you are,

12:56.133 --> 12:56.631
and you use less vibrato
in your voice?

12:56.631 --> 12:58.267
and you use less vibrato
in your voice?

12:58.267 --> 12:59.501
’Cause I invented that trick!

12:59.501 --> 13:01.103
‐ All right, let’s go.

13:01.103 --> 13:03.905
We’ll be back next week
with some more.

13:03.905 --> 13:05.373
You know who she
reminds me of?

13:05.373 --> 13:07.408
‐ Kathleen Marcovici.
Remember her?

13:07.408 --> 13:09.109
‐ Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Remember that bitch mother,

13:09.109 --> 13:11.245
Hannah?
‐ God, I hated her,

13:11.245 --> 13:13.913
mouthing off to me
at every PTA meeting.

13:13.913 --> 13:15.514
‐ Yeah.
‐ Bitch.

13:15.514 --> 13:17.383
‐ Let’s take an Uber
to their place

13:17.383 --> 13:19.251
and fuck with them.
‐ Your treat!

13:19.251 --> 13:21.319
Oh.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.190
‐ Actually, Auntie Frankie,
we met on Tinder,

13:26.190 --> 13:27.724
so we’ve been texting
for months.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.492
It was just
a weird coincidence‐‐

13:29.492 --> 13:32.195
‐ Show of hands.
Who’s bored with this story?

13:32.195 --> 13:33.663
‐ You’re right.
This story sucks.

13:33.663 --> 13:36.731
I feel like I was
on a Tyler Perry show on OWN.

13:38.166 --> 13:39.634
‐  What the fuck
are you doing?

13:39.634 --> 13:41.502
‐  He seems sweet.
‐ He’s Satan!

13:41.502 --> 13:42.936
‐ May I please have
some more wine?

13:42.936 --> 13:44.137
‐ Funny and polite.

13:44.137 --> 13:46.173
He says may, not can,

13:46.173 --> 13:48.308
because he knows
what words mean.

13:48.308 --> 13:50.209
Aren’t they cute together?

13:50.209 --> 13:51.743
Go on, hold hands.

13:51.743 --> 13:51.926
We don’t mind if you canoodle
at the table.

13:51.926 --> 13:53.579
We don’t mind if you canoodle
at the table.

13:53.579 --> 13:56.047
‐ Love is love.

13:56.047 --> 13:58.883
Go on, kiss.

13:58.883 --> 14:02.286
Ooh!

14:02.286 --> 14:05.021
‐ I don’t care
what Dr. Ben Carson says.

14:05.021 --> 14:07.423
I like when nice men kiss.

14:07.423 --> 14:09.792
‐ DeNeil, why don’t you
go get the dessert?

14:09.792 --> 14:11.159
And Billy, go with him.

14:11.159 --> 14:13.228
‐ Everybody loves me.

14:13.228 --> 14:14.929
‐ What the hell are you doing?

14:14.929 --> 14:16.563
You two hate everyone!

14:16.563 --> 14:18.098
You wouldn’t even let me watch
Mr. Rogers growing up

14:18.098 --> 14:21.101
because you said only
peeping toms wore cardigans.

14:21.101 --> 14:21.926
‐ I stand by that!

14:21.926 --> 14:22.702
‐ I stand by that!

14:22.702 --> 14:25.671
‐ Do you think that I invited
Billy to a family dinner

14:25.671 --> 14:27.739
so he can feel like
he’s part of this family?

14:27.739 --> 14:29.307
Why do you refuse
to hate the one person

14:29.307 --> 14:31.075
I fucking begged
you two to hate?

14:31.075 --> 14:32.343
I begged ya!
I begged ya!

14:32.343 --> 14:33.877
‐ He’s sweet and charming.

14:33.877 --> 14:36.713
‐ Yeah, and maybe Nate can
learn a thing or two.

14:36.713 --> 14:39.248
‐ I swear to God‐‐
‐ What the hell did I do?

14:39.248 --> 14:41.818
‐ I can’t believe
how much they like you.

14:41.818 --> 14:44.285
‐ I know. I can’t believe
how much I like this.

14:44.285 --> 14:46.621
Middle aged African‐American
women are my demo.

14:46.621 --> 14:49.156
‐ And you’re comfortable?
‐ Yeah, it’s weird.

14:49.156 --> 14:51.591
You know, whenever I eat pie,
it’s usually alone,

14:51.591 --> 14:51.926
standing over the sink,
but this feels very... familial.

14:51.926 --> 14:56.229
standing over the sink,
but this feels very... familial.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.231
Your aunts are so nice.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.233
My family dinners
are not like that.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.868
I’m sorry.
I’m never this open.

15:03.868 --> 15:06.537
You know, I haven’t even
done poppers.

15:06.537 --> 15:08.639
Unless Auntie Frankie
put some in the ham.

15:08.639 --> 15:10.541
It’s weird, you know?
It’s, like,

15:10.541 --> 15:12.308
do you know that scene
in "When Harry Met Sally"

15:12.308 --> 15:14.744
when Meg Ryan, like,
almost starts to cry

15:14.744 --> 15:16.511
’cause she talks
about the little kid

15:16.511 --> 15:19.748
pointing at a family and saying,
"I spy a family"?

15:19.748 --> 15:21.926
I’m not Meg Ryan.
I’m Sharon Stone, you know?

15:21.926 --> 15:23.017
I’m not Meg Ryan.
I’m Sharon Stone, you know?

15:23.017 --> 15:25.152
‐ I heard she’s in Mensa.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.620
Fucking Marcovicis.

15:27.620 --> 15:29.556
Hannah used to lie
in that hammock all day long

15:29.556 --> 15:31.290
drinking
Crystal Light and gin.

15:31.290 --> 15:32.691
‐ What a whore.
I hate them.

15:32.691 --> 15:34.092
‐ Strike the match
away from you.

15:34.092 --> 15:35.160
‐ I know how to light poop,
mother!

15:35.160 --> 15:36.294
‐ Oh, yeah?
‐ Get ready to‐‐

15:36.294 --> 15:37.495
ring the doorbell.
Get ready.

15:37.495 --> 15:38.496
Get ready.
Get ready. Get ready.

15:38.496 --> 15:39.797
‐ Go!
Go, go, go! Go!

15:39.797 --> 15:41.031
‐ Ring the doorbell!
Ring the doorbell!

15:41.031 --> 15:42.132
Ahh!

15:45.769 --> 15:47.603
‐

15:49.205 --> 15:50.439
‐ Oh!
‐

15:51.506 --> 15:51.926
‐ Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

15:51.926 --> 15:52.941
‐ Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

15:55.342 --> 15:57.344
‐ Why did you do this to me?

15:57.344 --> 16:00.146
‐ Wait, are you
Hannah Marcovici?

16:00.146 --> 16:01.648
‐ No!

16:01.648 --> 16:04.384
The Marcovicis moved away
after Brian Williams got fired.

16:04.384 --> 16:06.018
My name is Willa Kaplan!

16:06.018 --> 16:09.754
I’m a retired schoolteacher,
and I’m upset!

16:09.754 --> 16:11.623
‐ Let’s go.
Quick, quick.

16:11.623 --> 16:14.425
‐ At least it was fun
to light poop.

16:14.425 --> 16:16.994
She probably deserved it
some way anyway.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.926
Oh, happy birthday,
sweetheart.

16:21.926 --> 16:22.031
Oh, happy birthday,
sweetheart.

16:22.031 --> 16:23.265
I love you.

16:24.500 --> 16:28.936
‐ Happy 36th anniversary
of your labor.

16:28.936 --> 16:30.771
You can be a fun mom.

16:30.771 --> 16:33.307
‐ Did you just give me
a compliment?

16:33.307 --> 16:36.042
‐ Yes, and it was a good one.

16:36.042 --> 16:37.376
‐ Oh, Julie.

16:37.376 --> 16:39.112
I’m sorry
for all the past birthdays

16:39.112 --> 16:40.613
you had
that weren’t perfect.

16:40.613 --> 16:42.180
Let’s have a do‐over.

16:42.180 --> 16:43.548
‐ Oh, that’s silly.
‐ Yes.

16:43.548 --> 16:44.882
‐ There’s no do‐overs.
‐ Let’s go back

16:44.882 --> 16:46.518
to that restaurant,
that terrible restaurant

16:46.518 --> 16:48.185
where they cook food
in front of you,

16:48.185 --> 16:51.054
and this time I won’t leave.

16:51.054 --> 16:51.926
‐ Okay.
It’s a deal.

16:51.926 --> 16:52.655
‐ Okay.
It’s a deal.

16:52.655 --> 16:54.257
‐ Come on.
‐ Ohh.

16:54.257 --> 16:56.391
‐ Let’s find
an Irish neighborhood,

16:56.391 --> 16:57.659
and we’ll have a nightcap!

17:01.996 --> 17:04.432
‐ Oh, my God.

17:04.432 --> 17:06.666
Billy, where did you
even find this?

17:06.666 --> 17:08.701
‐ I found this lunatic
on Etsy

17:08.701 --> 17:10.369
who will literally draw
anyone’s face

17:10.369 --> 17:12.438
on a celebrity body,
so this is you and me

17:12.438 --> 17:13.739
as Michael Stipe
and Kate Pierson

17:13.739 --> 17:16.375
in the "Shiny Happy People"
video.

17:16.375 --> 17:17.876
‐ I don’t know what to say.

17:17.876 --> 17:19.044
‐ Happy Birthday, Jules.

17:19.044 --> 17:21.378
‐ Well, stray dogs ate
all the food again,

17:21.378 --> 17:23.948
and they bit
my neck and hands!

17:23.948 --> 17:27.016
I’m stuck doing deliveries just
because you’re dating DeNeil?

17:27.016 --> 17:28.251
This isn’t fair!

17:28.251 --> 17:28.809
‐ How was dinner with DeNeil?

17:28.809 --> 17:29.518
‐ How was dinner with DeNeil?

17:29.518 --> 17:30.786
I didn’t get a single text
from you

17:30.786 --> 17:32.020
that said
"Get me out of here"

17:32.020 --> 17:33.421
or "Call in a bomb threat."

17:33.421 --> 17:34.722
‐ I mean,
it started off awkward,

17:34.722 --> 17:36.090
but I forced myself
to smile,

17:36.090 --> 17:38.192
and I wound up getting
emotional over pie,

17:38.192 --> 17:39.826
and then it was great.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.227
I think there’s something
to the Sharon Stoning thing.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.829
‐ And you still like DeNeil?
‐ Yeah.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.298
Like, a lot, I think,
even after a family dinner.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.566
‐ That’s huge.
Family can be

17:46.566 --> 17:48.000
a real clit‐flattener.
‐ Hm.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.701
Hey, didn’t
E. E. Cummings say that?

17:49.701 --> 17:51.403
‐ Yes.
So when do I get to meet DeNeil?

17:51.403 --> 17:53.805
Oh, why don’t you invite him
to my birthday dinner tonight?

17:53.805 --> 17:55.273
- ‐ Oh, what time?
- ‐  Quarter past

17:55.273 --> 17:57.274
"you’re not invited."
‐

17:57.274 --> 17:58.708
You are everything.

17:58.708 --> 17:58.809
‐ Does anybody else
even work here?

17:58.809 --> 18:01.678
‐ Does anybody else
even work here?

18:04.780 --> 18:07.683
‐ Hey, bud, I’d like to order
for the birthday girl.

18:07.683 --> 18:10.718
She’s my old lady.
‐ Arthur, I swear to God.

18:10.718 --> 18:13.420
‐ Chickens be clucking,
am I right?

18:13.420 --> 18:17.156
‐ I’d like to propose a toast.

18:17.156 --> 18:19.925
The year was 1979.

18:19.925 --> 18:22.127
My haircut was awful.

18:22.127 --> 18:23.628
"Bangs,"
I told the stylist.

18:23.628 --> 18:25.930
"Let’s try bangs,"
but no.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.809
He was dead‐set
on a center part.

18:28.809 --> 18:28.866
He was dead‐set
on a center part.

18:28.866 --> 18:32.603
‐ Sorry to interrupt, Mom.
I have to go to the bathroom.

18:32.603 --> 18:34.570
‐ Pull your hair back
when you vomit.

18:34.570 --> 18:36.172
You look so pretty tonight.

18:36.172 --> 18:37.773
So DeNeil, DeNeil,

18:37.773 --> 18:41.176
who do you think looks good
with a center part?

18:41.176 --> 18:42.511
Nobody!

18:42.511 --> 18:44.512
‐ Okay, we’d like
to invite a guest

18:44.512 --> 18:46.980
behind the grill
to learn a trick.

18:46.980 --> 18:49.416
Who’s the most athletic person
in the group?

18:49.416 --> 18:51.083
‐ Uh, that’d be me.

18:51.083 --> 18:52.519
‐ All right, come around.

18:52.519 --> 18:55.387
So, we cut the meat,
and we throw the meat.

18:55.387 --> 18:56.455
Think you can handle it?

18:56.455 --> 18:58.356
‐ Yeah, I think
I can handle it.

18:58.356 --> 18:58.809
‐ Billy, there you are!

18:58.809 --> 19:00.491
‐ Billy, there you are!

19:00.491 --> 19:02.226
‐ Matthew, I think Julie
made it pretty clear

19:02.226 --> 19:03.527
you weren’t invited here.

19:03.527 --> 19:05.929
‐ Shh. DeNeil,
Billy doesn’t like you.

19:05.929 --> 19:07.230
It took me a few hours,

19:07.230 --> 19:09.765
but I finally realized
what Sharon Stoning means.

19:09.765 --> 19:12.668
Okay? He’s pretending
to have emotions for you.

19:12.668 --> 19:15.003
‐ Is that true?
‐ No!

19:15.003 --> 19:20.874
I mean, it was,
but now I really like you,

19:20.874 --> 19:23.009
and, you know, I’m
so used to separating things,

19:23.009 --> 19:25.678
and‐‐
‐ Billy, I got to be honest.

19:25.678 --> 19:28.648
When you were on Tinder,
you were a lot less sappy.

19:28.648 --> 19:28.809
‐ What?
‐ You’re kind of emotional.

19:28.809 --> 19:30.182
‐ What?
‐ You’re kind of emotional.

19:30.182 --> 19:32.551
I don’t know,
and it’s kind of a turn‐off.

19:32.551 --> 19:34.018
‐ Are you fucking kidding me?

19:34.018 --> 19:35.953
No, no, no, no.
I’m a block of ice.

19:35.953 --> 19:38.321
I checked Deadline
at my dad’s funeral.

19:38.321 --> 19:40.057
When Bing Bong died,
I nodded off.

19:40.057 --> 19:42.892
I Shazamed songs
during "Still Alice."

19:42.892 --> 19:44.526
‐ Look, this is
way too much.

19:44.526 --> 19:46.328
You’re way too attached.

19:46.328 --> 19:47.896
We’ve only known each other
for a couple of days.

19:47.896 --> 19:49.731
I’m going back to Atlanta.
‐ No! Wait‐‐

19:49.731 --> 19:51.799
‐ When I tell Denise
that you two are over,

19:51.799 --> 19:53.568
you’re gonna go back
to doing deliveries

19:53.568 --> 19:55.602
for the rest
of your non‐equity life.

19:55.602 --> 19:56.803
‐ Get the fuck out of here,
Matthew!

19:56.803 --> 19:57.704
‐ Oh!

19:57.704 --> 19:58.809
‐ Who can refill
my Buddha‐tini?

19:58.809 --> 19:59.673
‐ Who can refill
my Buddha‐tini?

19:59.673 --> 20:01.807
‐ Look,
there is that maniac

20:01.807 --> 20:04.509
who lit the dog shit on fire
outside our house.

20:04.509 --> 20:06.444
‐ Excuse me?
‐ Do you know

20:06.444 --> 20:08.446
I got dog shit
all over our hammock

20:08.446 --> 20:10.281
chasing after you
and then falling

20:10.281 --> 20:11.782
into the hammock
feet‐first?

20:11.782 --> 20:14.050
‐ You know what?
I left my lights on.

20:14.050 --> 20:15.318
I’ll be right back.

20:15.318 --> 20:17.753
‐ Somebody trip her
before she gets to the door.

20:17.753 --> 20:18.954
‐ You got great knife skills.

20:18.954 --> 20:20.622
‐ Yeah, well,
years of practice.

20:20.622 --> 20:24.192
And sometimes,
all you need is talent.

20:24.192 --> 20:25.759
Ah! I’m blind!
‐ Oh!

20:25.759 --> 20:27.095
‐
‐ Ah! Hey!

20:27.095 --> 20:28.809
Can we get a medic, please?
Some first aid?

20:28.809 --> 20:29.329
Can we get a medic, please?
Some first aid?

20:29.329 --> 20:31.131
‐ I grilled my arms!

20:31.131 --> 20:33.366
And without a marinade!

20:33.366 --> 20:34.801
‐

20:34.801 --> 20:36.502
Happy birthday, Julie.

20:36.502 --> 20:40.806
You’re already 36, and you just
threw up in a public restroom.

20:43.173 --> 20:44.174
Oh, my God.

20:44.174 --> 20:45.709
Excuse me. I’m sorry.

20:45.709 --> 20:48.445
Are you Kate Pierson
from the B‐52s?

20:48.445 --> 20:50.246
‐ Yeah.
‐ Oh, my God, Kate Pierson,

20:50.246 --> 20:53.316
I can’t believe
I’m meeting you on my birthday.

20:53.316 --> 20:56.818
Do you have any idea
what your work has meant to me?

20:56.818 --> 20:58.809
‐ No, but I have a sneaking
suspicion I’m about to find out.

20:58.809 --> 21:00.554
‐ No, but I have a sneaking
suspicion I’m about to find out.

21:00.554 --> 21:01.922
‐ When I was 11 years old,

21:01.922 --> 21:05.491
I didn’t know
who I wanted to be one day,

21:05.491 --> 21:09.729
and then I saw you and Cindy
in beehives and go‐go boots,

21:09.729 --> 21:13.232
harmonizing next to openly gay
Southern men,

21:13.232 --> 21:18.936
and I just realized this is
who I want to be one day.

21:18.936 --> 21:22.539
You gave me
someone to aspire to,

21:22.539 --> 21:24.807
and I didn’t feel
so alone anymore.

21:24.807 --> 21:26.508
‐ Well, being alone
isn’t so bad.

21:26.508 --> 21:28.809
That’s why sometimes people
have to duck into the bathroom

21:28.809 --> 21:29.110
That’s why sometimes people
have to duck into the bathroom

21:29.110 --> 21:32.080
just to get a couple of minutes
to be by themselves.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.581
You know what I mean?

21:33.581 --> 21:35.249
Anyway, happy birthday.

21:35.249 --> 21:36.716
‐ Thanks.

21:36.716 --> 21:39.786
I got to say, you know,
it’s real human of you

21:39.786 --> 21:41.654
to listen
to all my bullshit.

21:41.654 --> 21:43.456
‐ Well, now can I have
a little bit of privacy?

21:43.456 --> 21:44.490
‐ Oh, my God. Yes.

21:44.490 --> 21:45.557
Oh, please.
Of course.

21:45.557 --> 21:46.691
I’m sorry, Kate Pierson.

21:46.691 --> 21:48.860
Thank you. Enjoy.
Uh, enjoy.

21:48.860 --> 21:50.094
‐ Thank you.
‐ Touched‐‐I just touched you.

21:50.094 --> 21:51.595
I’m sorry.
I touched your shoulder.

21:51.595 --> 21:53.164
Okay, good‐bye.
I love you. Thank you.

21:53.164 --> 21:54.698

22:13.813 --> 22:16.916
I’ve been fucking abandoned
on my birthday‐‐

22:16.916 --> 22:18.417
again.

22:27.958 --> 22:28.809
Chasing after DeNeil
was so stupid.

22:28.809 --> 22:30.126
Chasing after DeNeil
was so stupid.

22:30.126 --> 22:32.628
‐ Why?
’Cause he’s in great shape, huh?

22:32.628 --> 22:34.530
‐ That,
and I also think

22:34.530 --> 22:36.031
when it comes
to the guys in my life,

22:36.031 --> 22:39.133
I’m not ready
to stop compartmentalizing.

22:39.133 --> 22:40.267
The fact is,

22:40.267 --> 22:42.503
when Homeland Security
shut down Rentboy,

22:42.503 --> 22:44.438
all of our lives
fell to shit.

22:44.438 --> 22:45.706
‐ I think the secret
is just keeping

22:45.706 --> 22:47.540
your expectations
really low.

22:47.540 --> 22:48.874
That way you can’t
be disappointed,

22:48.874 --> 22:50.910
and a birthday is
just another shitty day

22:50.910 --> 22:52.777
but with cake
that you have to share.

22:52.777 --> 22:54.579
‐ Are you really gonna
cut out alcohol?

22:54.579 --> 22:55.980
‐ Oh, yeah.
No, I’m never letting

22:55.980 --> 22:58.549

‐ Happy birthday, Jules.

22:58.809 --> 23:00.651
‐ Happy birthday, Jules.

23:00.651 --> 23:02.419
Make a wish.

23:02.419 --> 23:04.554
‐ It already came true.

23:04.554 --> 23:05.955
‐ It did?
‐ No, I’m joking.

23:05.955 --> 23:08.557
I’m a very unhappy person.

‐ Yeah, go home, kid.
