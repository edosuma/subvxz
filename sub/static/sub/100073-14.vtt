WEBVTT

00:01.530 --> 00:03.350
I was walking Ozzy past the Millers, and

00:04.130 --> 00:05.220
he started freaking out.

00:05.220 --> 00:07.430
He's a retired bomb dog
from the TSA.

00:07.430 --> 00:10.930
He definitely smelled
some explosives inside.

00:10.930 --> 00:13.470
Okay. Thank you.
We will take it from here.

00:13.470 --> 00:15.800
Control, 7-Adam-15
requesting bomb squad

00:15.800 --> 00:18.430
at 4312 Moreland Street.

00:18.430 --> 00:21.670
Ma'am, step back.

00:21.670 --> 00:22.550
Ready?
Yeah.

00:23.550 --> 00:25.470
Police!

00:25.470 --> 00:27.340
Yes?
Can I help you?

00:29.170 --> 00:30.800
Boy!

00:37.010 --> 00:38.550
Are you okay?!

00:38.550 --> 00:40.130
What happened?

00:40.130 --> 00:42.170
Some more
gender reveal mayhem.

00:42.170 --> 00:44.510
They used C-4
to set it off.

00:44.510 --> 00:46.260
Seven other guests
are in the ER

00:46.260 --> 00:48.510
being treated for
glitter-related injuries.

00:48.510 --> 00:50.670
Most of those occurred when
the second device went off.

00:52.930 --> 00:55.300
They're having twins.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.720
♪ Whoa, oh oh, oh oh-oh,
whoa, oh oh ♪

00:57.720 --> 00:58.930
Boy and a girl.

00:58.930 --> 01:01.300

01:01.300 --> 01:04.720
♪ Like I know
you want me to do ♪

01:10.340 --> 01:12.130
Remember when we used to
be able to eat

01:12.130 --> 01:14.130
nothing but French fries
and still have abs?

01:14.130 --> 01:16.170
Oh, I was never blessed
with your metabolism.

01:16.170 --> 01:17.430
Took joining the police

01:17.430 --> 01:18.800
to get in tip-top shape.

01:20.970 --> 01:22.720
What's wrong?

01:22.720 --> 01:24.840
Nothing. Just got a little
speedy there for a second.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.260
Too much coffee?

01:26.260 --> 01:27.760
None, actually.

01:27.760 --> 01:29.880
I cut back.
It was getting me too amped up.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.220
Put this on.

01:31.220 --> 01:32.630
Oh. No, I'm good.
It's alright.

01:32.630 --> 01:34.550
Doctor's orders.

01:34.550 --> 01:37.430
If you insist.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.590
Let me see.

01:40.010 --> 01:43.300
Wow. That's high for
a man in tip-top shape.

01:43.300 --> 01:46.010
When's the last time that
you had a full physical?

01:46.010 --> 01:48.670
Two months ago,
and it was all good.

01:48.670 --> 01:49.930
Are you under
a lot of stress?

01:51.090 --> 01:53.380
Right.
Stupid question.

01:53.380 --> 01:55.510
I mean, but -- but how
your body handles

01:55.510 --> 01:58.010
a high-stress lifestyle
is based on your physiology.

01:58.010 --> 02:00.170
Is that a fancy way
of saying I'm old?

02:00.170 --> 02:02.170
Well, I mean,
maybe a little.

02:02.170 --> 02:04.630
Most cops enter the job
in their 20s,

02:04.630 --> 02:06.220
when they can handle
the stress hormones.

02:06.220 --> 02:08.220
And French fries.
And French fries.

02:08.220 --> 02:10.340
By the time the cops
are in their 40s,

02:10.340 --> 02:13.010
I mean, they're trained
in stress management.

02:13.010 --> 02:14.630
But you jumped
into the deep end.

02:14.630 --> 02:16.470
Yeah, but I've handled
stress before --

02:16.470 --> 02:19.720
I mean, late mortgage payments,
failed marriage.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.340
Of course. But being shot at
on a daily basis is different.

02:24.510 --> 02:25.800
No.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.510
Keep this on for the week.
Alright?

02:27.510 --> 02:30.220
I want to track
how your pulse races.

02:30.220 --> 02:32.930
My instincts are that it happens
more than you realize.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.510
Hey! Stay!

02:44.510 --> 02:45.800
Stay!

02:45.800 --> 02:47.340
Kojo!
Oh, Kojo, Kojo!

02:47.340 --> 02:48.880
Come here. Check this out.
What's this?

02:48.880 --> 02:51.220
Ohh, what a good boy!

02:51.220 --> 02:52.260
Are you so excited
to meet Jackson?

02:52.260 --> 02:53.430
Aah! You're such --
What is happening?

02:53.430 --> 02:54.840
Okay, so, do you remember...

02:54.840 --> 02:56.720
...how I was looking
to get a dog?

02:56.720 --> 02:58.130
No.

02:58.130 --> 03:00.090
Yeah, dogs are super helpful
for trauma recovery.

03:00.090 --> 03:03.430
I filled out
the applications to foster Kojo,

03:03.430 --> 03:04.760
and they just
dropped him off.

03:04.760 --> 03:05.970
Oh, oh.
It's okay, it's okay.

03:05.970 --> 03:07.050
Um, so we have
a dog now.

03:07.050 --> 03:08.340
Yeah. Isn't it great?

03:08.340 --> 03:09.340
Yeah.

03:09.340 --> 03:10.670
Kojo, let's go for a walk.
Come on.

03:10.670 --> 03:11.800
Okay. Go on.
Okay,
let's let Jackson sleep.

03:11.800 --> 03:12.800
He's so strong.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.220
Come on! Good boy!

03:14.220 --> 03:15.220
Yeah!

03:15.220 --> 03:17.340
Alright.
Let's get started.

03:17.340 --> 03:19.470
First things first,
let's welcome

03:19.470 --> 03:22.010
Detective Armstrong
back from vacation, huh?

03:24.800 --> 03:26.050
Ah, yeah, thank you.

03:26.050 --> 03:27.380
Okay, look.

03:27.380 --> 03:29.340
Before I get started
with the morning's business,

03:29.340 --> 03:30.670
I just want
to thank everyone again

03:30.670 --> 03:32.970
for all their hard work
in the Rosalind Dyer case.

03:34.300 --> 03:36.930
That was a...
difficult time.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.380
Now...

03:41.380 --> 03:42.800
you all have printouts
of the latest developments

03:42.800 --> 03:45.050
from the detective tables.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.840
But I want to go over one item.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.380
A federal operation is
launching in Filipino Town,

03:49.380 --> 03:52.510
so until further notice,
all marked units

03:52.510 --> 03:55.970
are to stay clear of Alvarado,
between Montrose and the 101.

03:55.970 --> 03:57.220
Anything we should
be aware of?

03:57.220 --> 03:58.670
Not according to the FBI,

03:58.670 --> 04:01.050
but, you know,
they ain't big on sharing,

04:01.050 --> 04:03.590
so if you need to contact
anybody in that area,

04:03.590 --> 04:05.380
run them through LA CLEAR

04:05.380 --> 04:07.930
and notify your supervisor
immediately.

04:07.930 --> 04:09.430
Officer Nolan.

04:09.430 --> 04:12.220
Can you enlighten us
on what LA CLEAR is?

04:12.220 --> 04:14.170
Yes, sir --

04:14.170 --> 04:15.720
I'm sorry.
You need to get that?

04:15.720 --> 04:18.010
Uh, it's not my phone, sir.
That's just a fitness tracker.

04:18.010 --> 04:19.720
I have it set
to alert me

04:19.720 --> 04:21.839
when my heart rate
increases rapidly.

04:21.839 --> 04:22.930
I'm tracking my stress.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.130
Just learning how
to manage it better.

04:24.130 --> 04:26.050
Do I stress you out,
Officer Nolan?

04:26.050 --> 04:26.840
No, sir.

04:30.300 --> 04:33.670
LA CLEAR is the largest
deconfliction database

04:33.670 --> 04:35.220
for law enforcement
in the West.

04:35.220 --> 04:37.090
And what does that
mean, Officer West?

04:37.090 --> 04:39.630
Every federal, state,
and local covert operation

04:39.630 --> 04:43.010
is monitored there to prevent
duplication of efforts

04:43.010 --> 04:44.630
or blue-on-blue situations.

04:44.630 --> 04:47.590
And can you access LA CLEAR,
Officer Chen?

04:47.590 --> 04:48.720
No, sir.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.050
For security reasons,

04:50.050 --> 04:52.300
all access is reserved for
higher-level officers.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.720
Bottom line, this is
a very serious tool,

04:54.720 --> 04:57.670
and we don't call unless
the stakes are high.

04:57.670 --> 04:59.430
Anything less,
figure it out.

04:59.430 --> 05:02.130
Okay, people, that's it.

05:02.130 --> 05:03.300
Oh.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.630
And if anyone has advice
for Officer Nolan

05:05.630 --> 05:07.090
on how to deal
with stress...

05:08.470 --> 05:10.470
...I'm sure he'd
appreciate suggestions.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.010
I try and dance at least
20 minutes a day.

05:16.220 --> 05:17.630
Target practice.

05:17.630 --> 05:18.840
And the "Great British
Baking Show."

05:18.840 --> 05:20.470
♪ Then it need to fall back ♪

05:20.470 --> 05:21.720
Hell if I know.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.930
I wrecked my family from
the stress I was under.

05:23.930 --> 05:25.300
The larger the caliber,
the better.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.760
Oh, and prioritize
the holiday episodes.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.510
Meditation will change
your life.

05:30.510 --> 05:32.010
Goat yoga.

05:33.670 --> 05:34.930
What yoga?

05:34.930 --> 05:36.720
You got to find a way
to turn your brain off --

05:36.720 --> 05:38.760
lift weights, play ball,
paint a picture.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.590
Doesn't matter what it is,
just that you focus completely.

05:41.590 --> 05:44.010
The most important thing
is to identify the source

05:44.010 --> 05:47.090
of your stress
and confront it head-on.

05:47.090 --> 05:49.300
Trust me, I'm living proof of
what this job can take from you

05:49.300 --> 05:50.510
if you don't.

05:50.510 --> 05:52.010
Good advice.
Thank you.

05:52.010 --> 05:53.010
Alright.

05:53.010 --> 05:54.670
Uh, Nick, um...

05:54.670 --> 05:57.050
in the interest
of confronting things head-on,

05:57.050 --> 05:59.090
Rosalind said something to me
the last time I saw her.

05:59.090 --> 06:00.590
I hate to even
bring it up.

06:00.590 --> 06:02.090
Let it fly.
I'm in a good place.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.930
She said she had
one more secret --

06:05.930 --> 06:07.260
about you.

06:07.260 --> 06:09.550
And that...it was bad.

06:12.220 --> 06:15.720
You warned me not to let
her get back into my head,

06:15.720 --> 06:17.510
and you turned around
and let her get into yours.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.800
She is
playing you, John.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.090
I'm all out of secrets.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.260
That's what I thought.
Thank you.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.760
I'm sorry
I even mentioned it.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.800
You're just practicing
what I preached.

06:27.800 --> 06:28.760
You're welcome.

06:30.010 --> 06:32.010
Getting a dog
is a big mistake.

06:32.010 --> 06:34.380
I don't remember
asking you.

06:34.380 --> 06:36.550
Well, tough. It's my job
to train you how to succeed.

06:36.550 --> 06:38.670
And adding a dependent
is only gonna distract you.

06:38.670 --> 06:40.010
Oh, yeah?

06:40.010 --> 06:42.590
How 'bout a cute,
snuggly dependent?

06:42.590 --> 06:44.380
Not the point.

06:44.380 --> 06:45.630
Who's watching the dog
while you're working?

06:45.630 --> 06:47.470
I paid a neighbor.

06:47.470 --> 06:49.130
And Jackson's fine
with it?

06:49.130 --> 06:50.550
Of course.
Why wouldn't he be?

06:50.550 --> 06:52.260
She should've asked me.

06:52.260 --> 06:53.630
Did you say anything?

06:53.630 --> 06:55.970
I mean, after everything she
went through? Absolutely not.

06:55.970 --> 06:57.670
Then what are you
complaining about?

06:57.670 --> 06:59.800
She should've consulted me.
I'm her roommate.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.840
Probably,
but it's her apartment.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.590
She's the one
on the lease.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.170
So you're saying I don't
have a leg to stand on?

07:05.170 --> 07:06.090
Pretty much.

07:07.340 --> 07:10.300
Just face it --
you don't like dogs.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.300
Wrong.
I love dogs.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.840
I just think they're
a lot of responsibility,

07:13.840 --> 07:15.010
and I'm not sure
you're ready for it.

07:15.010 --> 07:16.130
Oh!

07:16.130 --> 07:18.720
But you were
when you were my age?

07:18.720 --> 07:21.380
At your age, I'd done two tours
in Afghanistan and Iraq,

07:21.380 --> 07:23.510
the second in charge of
a squad of 10 soldiers.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.880
Show-off.

07:25.880 --> 07:26.880
What was that?

07:26.880 --> 07:27.670
Hm?

07:27.670 --> 07:29.220
Nothing.

07:29.220 --> 07:30.010
Police.

07:33.050 --> 07:34.670
You're too late.
It's gone.

07:34.670 --> 07:35.970
It's?

07:35.970 --> 07:37.050
We got a call about
a Peeping Tom?

07:39.930 --> 07:42.300
Wendy loves to tan
in the morning.

07:42.300 --> 07:44.880
Last few days,
this drone has shown up

07:44.880 --> 07:46.970
hovering overhead,
spying on her.

07:46.970 --> 07:48.220
Well, we can put out
an alert,

07:48.220 --> 07:50.300
but drones can be
tricky to track down.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.260
It's bad enough guys
are constantly hitting on her

07:52.260 --> 07:53.340
whenever we go out.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.090
Now she's not even safe
in her own home?

07:56.090 --> 07:58.090
You guys don't
believe me?

07:58.090 --> 08:02.550
There's like a gravitational
pull Wendy has no control over.

08:02.550 --> 08:03.930
Honey?

08:03.930 --> 08:05.630
They say they can't do
anything about the drone.

08:06.970 --> 08:09.590
I'm sure that's not true.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.590
The next time I tan...

08:11.590 --> 08:13.050
you can come watch.

08:14.340 --> 08:15.510
Ma'am --

08:15.510 --> 08:16.800
Are you hitting
on my wife?

08:16.800 --> 08:18.430
What? No!

08:18.430 --> 08:19.720
Get the hell
out of my house!

08:19.720 --> 08:21.720
Sir --
Now!

08:21.720 --> 08:24.510
♪ But look at me now,
look at me now ♪

08:24.510 --> 08:25.880
Thanks.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.510
-Oh, hi.
-Thank you.

08:27.510 --> 08:30.340
Don't freak out.
They ran out of falafel.

08:30.340 --> 08:32.760
Who the hell
runs out of falafel?

08:32.760 --> 08:33.720
What'd you get me?

08:33.720 --> 08:34.880
Shawarma.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.130
Did you get hot sauce?

08:36.130 --> 08:38.340
-That too.
-Hey, watch it, buddy!

08:38.340 --> 08:41.049
Looks like happy hour
came early.

08:41.049 --> 08:42.220
Sir.

08:42.220 --> 08:44.380
Have you been drinking?

08:44.380 --> 08:46.630
Rainbow lozenge
hidey hole.

08:46.630 --> 08:48.430
Rainbow lozenge
hidey hole.

08:48.430 --> 08:50.090
Forget booze. This has
ecstasy written all over it.

08:50.090 --> 08:51.380
Man-- Manscape.

08:51.380 --> 08:53.010
Or acid.

08:53.010 --> 08:55.800
Sir, I need you to put
your hands behind your back.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.260
Sir, are you okay?

08:59.800 --> 09:01.010
Oh --

09:03.380 --> 09:05.050
Sir, can you tell us
what happened to you?

09:05.050 --> 09:06.630
Hamster puddle tortilla.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.340
I think he's been shot.
Hamster puddle tortilla.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.670
We're gonna get you
some help. Come on.

09:10.670 --> 09:13.090
7-Adam-15 in full pursuit
of robbery suspect.

09:16.050 --> 09:17.130
White male in purple pants.

09:19.430 --> 09:20.670
In there!

09:40.300 --> 09:41.260
Clear.

09:41.260 --> 09:42.590
Clear.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.340
Clear.

09:57.340 --> 09:58.510
God! I touched it!

09:58.510 --> 09:59.590
Show me your hands!

09:59.590 --> 10:01.220
Whoa.

10:01.220 --> 10:02.840
I-I'm gonna puke.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.590
Down on the ground!

10:04.590 --> 10:06.090
Facedown.

10:08.720 --> 10:09.630
What'd you touch?

10:09.630 --> 10:12.300
Ugh. A dead body.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.380
Check it out.

10:30.550 --> 10:33.030
He's incredibly lucky
the damage isn't worse.

10:33.130 --> 10:35.810
The bullet appears to
have lodged itself
in his speech center.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.010
Snarf yum
orange Beyoncé.

10:38.010 --> 10:39.340
Is that why he's
talking nonsense?

10:39.340 --> 10:40.880
It's not nonsense
to him.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.300
The bullet
is causing aphasia,

10:42.300 --> 10:44.050
where the words
he intends to say

10:44.050 --> 10:46.380
and what actually comes out
are different.

10:46.380 --> 10:49.010
Ball pit small envy?

10:49.010 --> 10:50.300
You were shot in the head,
Mr. Hollenbock.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.670
We're getting you prepped
for surgery.

10:51.670 --> 10:53.880
We're gonna need that bullet
once it's removed.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.720
I can tell the surgeon,
but there is a chance

10:55.720 --> 10:57.170
that we may need
to leave it in.

10:57.170 --> 10:59.430
Even with the bullet,
I doubt we'll find the shooter.

10:59.430 --> 11:00.590
Why not?

11:00.590 --> 11:02.430
The best explanation
for the impact angle

11:02.430 --> 11:03.800
and lack of killing velocity

11:03.800 --> 11:05.760
is that some idiot
fired his gun into the air.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.010
And the gravity brought it down
onto Eddie's skull.

11:08.010 --> 11:09.470
And given the math
of ballistics,

11:09.470 --> 11:12.550
we're looking at a firing radius
of almost a mile.

11:12.550 --> 11:14.430
Which in Los Angeles

11:14.430 --> 11:17.300
is a suspect pool of
several thousand suspects.

11:17.300 --> 11:20.130
Poop.

11:20.130 --> 11:21.800
And here I am thinking
I could take it slow

11:21.800 --> 11:22.800
my first day back.

11:25.170 --> 11:27.170
Broken neck.

11:27.170 --> 11:29.090
Yeah, and it wasn't
an accident.

11:29.090 --> 11:31.010
That lump at the top
of his back --

11:31.010 --> 11:32.840
avulsion of
the vertebrae.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.670
His neck was snapped by someone
who knew what they were doing.

11:34.670 --> 11:35.970
Time of death?

11:35.970 --> 11:37.590
Uh, we're still waiting
on the coroner to arrive,

11:37.590 --> 11:39.300
but I checked his legs.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.970
Based on lividity,
I'm guessing 12 hours or so.

11:41.970 --> 11:43.510
You canvass the scene yet?

11:43.510 --> 11:44.670
Not yet.

11:44.670 --> 11:46.300
Okay, why don't you
start that?

11:46.300 --> 11:47.720
Detective Harper and I
will finish up here.

11:47.720 --> 11:48.760
Divide and conquer.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.010
Done.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.470
Okay.

11:51.470 --> 11:52.630
Any ID?

11:52.630 --> 11:54.970
No, just...this.

11:54.970 --> 11:56.050
Ah.

11:57.510 --> 11:59.470
Soup kitchen voucher.

11:59.470 --> 12:00.760
He was homeless?

12:00.760 --> 12:01.970
Yet his clothes are new.

12:01.970 --> 12:03.050
Yep, brand-new.

12:03.050 --> 12:04.550
A transient
coming into money

12:04.550 --> 12:06.010
would definitely
make him a target.

12:06.010 --> 12:08.300
Check his street wallet?

12:08.300 --> 12:10.760
Homeless folks sometimes
keep their valuables

12:10.760 --> 12:11.930
in their shoes.

12:16.630 --> 12:17.720
Mm.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.970
Props must be given.

12:21.970 --> 12:23.470
Hotel room key.

12:23.470 --> 12:25.300
There we go.

12:34.470 --> 12:35.470
Excuse me!

12:35.470 --> 12:37.430
Hey, what's up?

12:37.430 --> 12:39.590
Do you know who owns
this camera you're working on?

12:39.590 --> 12:41.220
I need to get ahold
of the footage.

12:41.220 --> 12:42.720
Uh, I could
give you a name,

12:42.720 --> 12:44.260
but it'd be
a waste of your time.

12:44.260 --> 12:46.220
Camera's been broken for a week.
That's why they called me out.

12:46.220 --> 12:48.760
I was just swapping in
a new one.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.470
Thought I cracked the case.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.840
Sorry.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.340
Hey, does that
thing work?

12:53.340 --> 12:54.840
I've been thinking
about buying one.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.720
Oh. I just got it.
I'm supposed to, um --

12:56.720 --> 12:58.880
Nolan, hey. Let's go.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.300
Thank you.
Alright.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.090
We found a key card on
the victim from an SRO downtown.

13:04.090 --> 13:06.010
Armstrong's
meeting us there.

13:06.010 --> 13:08.220
No. Yeah, I-I'll be
right there.

13:08.220 --> 13:09.300
Right where?

13:09.300 --> 13:10.470
My apartment.

13:10.470 --> 13:11.970
Not unless
it's a crime scene.

13:15.590 --> 13:17.170
Oh, no.

13:17.170 --> 13:19.010
Oh, my God.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.050
Kojo, what did you do?!

13:23.050 --> 13:24.970
Get -- Get down.
Just...

13:24.970 --> 13:26.130
Sit!

13:28.050 --> 13:29.630
How did you do that?

13:29.630 --> 13:31.220
Come on.

13:41.170 --> 13:42.550
Ohh, man!

13:42.550 --> 13:44.050
Oh, no.

13:44.050 --> 13:45.380
This is Jackson's
varsity jacket.

13:45.380 --> 13:47.050
He's gonna be so upset.

13:47.050 --> 13:48.630
I don't really have
to say anything, do I?

13:48.630 --> 13:50.010
I'd rather you didn't.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.220
Manager said our victim
checked in three days ago

13:56.220 --> 13:58.090
under the name
Joe Delacruz.

13:58.090 --> 13:59.760
Paid a week in cash.

13:59.760 --> 14:00.800
You go in yet?

14:00.800 --> 14:02.430
And ruin the surprise?

14:02.430 --> 14:04.470
It's always better
to not enter a scene alone.

14:04.470 --> 14:06.470
So no one can accuse
you of malfeasance later.

14:06.470 --> 14:07.130
Exactly.

14:17.130 --> 14:19.590
Looks like Joe went
on quite the shopping spree.

14:19.590 --> 14:21.760
Yep.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.510
New clothes, shoes.

14:27.090 --> 14:28.800
Two different sizes.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.840
Well, that seems
like a clue.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.130
I'm guessing the manager
didn't mention someone
staying with Joe.

14:33.130 --> 14:34.670
This is not
the kind of establishment

14:34.670 --> 14:36.090
that pays
that kind of attention.

14:36.090 --> 14:38.430
Found cash. Looks to be about
five or six grand.

14:42.840 --> 14:43.930
Sorry.

14:43.930 --> 14:45.170
Wrong room.

14:45.170 --> 14:46.380
Hold on.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Hey!

14:58.170 --> 15:00.340

15:48.260 --> 15:49.340
Got a knife.

15:49.340 --> 15:50.220
Yep.

15:54.260 --> 15:55.300
Prosthetic leg?

15:55.300 --> 15:56.720
Yes, sir.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.720
That's a military knife.
You lose your leg in combat?

15:58.720 --> 16:00.090
Yes, sir.

16:00.090 --> 16:02.550
Got in an argument
with an I.E.D.

16:02.550 --> 16:04.220
Mitch?

16:04.220 --> 16:05.340
Sarge?

16:05.340 --> 16:06.720
Sarge?

16:06.720 --> 16:08.260
You know this guy?

16:08.260 --> 16:10.630
I was his squad leader
in Afghanistan.

16:15.650 --> 16:17.820
What happened?

16:17.820 --> 16:19.820
You had a fiancée
in San Diego,

16:19.820 --> 16:21.900
a job lined up
through Wounded Warriors.

16:21.900 --> 16:23.070
What can I say?

16:23.070 --> 16:24.900
I...

16:24.900 --> 16:26.940
moved on.

16:26.940 --> 16:29.070
You tell me what
I'm being charged with?

16:29.070 --> 16:30.650
Resisting arrest,
for starters.

16:30.650 --> 16:31.860
The rest is up
to the D.A.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.110
Right.

16:33.110 --> 16:36.650
And how exactly did the cops
end up in my hotel room?

16:36.650 --> 16:38.400
She can't tell you that.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.480
Yeah?

16:39.480 --> 16:41.030
But you can.

16:41.030 --> 16:42.480
I-I can't.

16:42.480 --> 16:45.230
Be in violation
of the victim's privacy.

16:45.230 --> 16:46.400
Victim?

16:49.270 --> 16:50.610
What happened to Joe?

16:50.610 --> 16:51.860
Is Joe alright?

16:51.860 --> 16:53.190
Look, I've already
said too much.

16:54.190 --> 16:55.980
Is he dead?

16:55.980 --> 16:58.480
Detectives will come
speak with you shortly.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.270
Mitch, inside.

17:08.770 --> 17:10.940
He doesn't seem
to like you very much.

17:12.650 --> 17:14.530
I'm the reason
he lost his leg.

17:16.690 --> 17:19.030
My son was attacked.

17:19.030 --> 17:21.609
So you need to go down there,
get the guy, and arrest him.

17:21.609 --> 17:23.109
What guy?

17:23.109 --> 17:25.400
My psycho neighbor!
He shot my son's drone down!

17:25.400 --> 17:26.730
Is that right?

17:26.730 --> 17:29.070
Yeah. And guess what.
We've got video proof.

17:29.070 --> 17:30.980
Show him the -- the video
from the drone camera.

17:30.980 --> 17:32.980
Dad, it's okay.
It's not a big deal.

17:32.980 --> 17:34.650
Can we just go?
No!

17:34.650 --> 17:36.940
Show the cop
the damn video.

17:52.530 --> 17:53.730
I can explain.

17:53.730 --> 17:55.730
There's no need.
Kid's got good taste.

17:55.730 --> 17:57.400
And Wendy is hot.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.400
Sir, what your son did is
actually illegal.

18:06.650 --> 18:07.730
Look, uh --

18:07.730 --> 18:08.940
one second.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.400
Lopez, West.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.940
I just solved two crimes
sitting in my office --

18:15.940 --> 18:18.730
Bradford and Chen's Peeping Tom
and your gunshot victim.

18:20.270 --> 18:21.900
I'm just saying.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.150
You guys don't really
think I killed him, right?

18:24.150 --> 18:26.190
We don't know anything. That's
why we're talking to you.

18:26.190 --> 18:29.400
The M.E. said that Joe died
from internal decapitation.

18:30.940 --> 18:34.820
He suffered spinal trauma from
an acute compression injury.

18:34.820 --> 18:38.440
Someone who knew how
snapped his neck.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.270
It wasn't me.

18:42.860 --> 18:45.190
Where'd the money under
the mattress come from?

18:45.190 --> 18:47.190
Couple of days ago,
Joe comes to me,

18:47.190 --> 18:50.110
says he found
a fortune in cash

18:50.110 --> 18:53.440
in this building
he snuck into, alright?

18:53.440 --> 18:56.820
Millions of dollars
stacked high on pallets.

18:56.820 --> 18:58.070
Millions?

18:58.070 --> 18:59.900
Yeah.

18:59.900 --> 19:02.110
And a bunch of machinery

19:02.110 --> 19:07.110
guarded by some heavy-duty guys
with serious weaponry.

19:07.110 --> 19:08.860
But he managed
to steal some of it.

19:08.860 --> 19:10.360
Why share
the money with you?

19:10.360 --> 19:11.690
'Cause we were tight.

19:11.690 --> 19:13.440
He's a fellow vet.

19:13.440 --> 19:15.480
Then you got a taste
of the rich life,

19:15.480 --> 19:18.110
decided you wanted the rest
of the money for yourself?

19:18.110 --> 19:20.440
He only took 10 grand.

19:20.440 --> 19:23.150
We burned through
half of that in a day.

19:23.150 --> 19:27.650
Look, I tried to tell him not
to go back there for more.

19:27.650 --> 19:29.820
He got lucky
the first time.

19:31.940 --> 19:33.820
And I should've gone
with him.

19:33.820 --> 19:35.610
'Cause he would've
gone with me.

19:41.190 --> 19:44.070
So, the money we found in Joe's
hotel room was counterfeit.

19:44.070 --> 19:45.480
Are you sure?

19:45.480 --> 19:47.530
It's the best fake I've seen,
but it's definitely a fake.

19:47.530 --> 19:48.980
He say where
it came from?

19:48.980 --> 19:51.480
A building downtown.
Said there's millions more.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.770
The machines Joe saw,
could they have been printers?

19:56.770 --> 19:57.570
Yeah.

20:03.820 --> 20:05.030
Looks abandoned.

20:05.030 --> 20:06.230
It's probably intentional.

20:06.230 --> 20:07.900
If I were printing
millions of dollars,

20:07.900 --> 20:09.820
I'd want to stay
below the radar.

20:09.820 --> 20:11.400
Alright,
look sharp, you guys.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.820
If these guys are ex-military,
they're gonna put up a fight.

20:37.660 --> 20:40.120
Not exactly the counterfeit
money-making operation

20:40.120 --> 20:41.370
we were sold on.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.990
Still believe
your Army buddy's story?

20:42.990 --> 20:44.910
Yeah. I do.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.700
They must've cleared out of here
after Joe's murder.

20:55.570 --> 20:57.450
You find something?

20:57.450 --> 20:59.530
Yeah.

20:59.530 --> 21:01.370
Uh, the name
of a security company.

21:01.370 --> 21:03.530
But I know this.
I've seen it somewhere.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.030
This morning
when I was canvassing,

21:05.030 --> 21:06.620
it was on the side
of the van.

21:06.620 --> 21:10.240
Um, the worker with the van
was fixing the camera

21:10.240 --> 21:11.950
across the street from
where Joe was killed.

21:11.950 --> 21:14.240
Uh, he said the camera
had been down for a week.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.490
Did you get a name?

21:15.490 --> 21:17.410
No. I thought
it was a dead end.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.330
I have him on body cam.

21:21.070 --> 21:22.660
Okay.

21:30.030 --> 21:31.490
That's him.

21:31.490 --> 21:33.660
He must've taken down the camera
so we couldn't trace it.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.370
We should run his face
through the database.

21:35.370 --> 21:36.740
Detective Harper.
Go to channel nine.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.660
Hey, sir.
We are here.

21:40.660 --> 21:42.330
Uh, we're in the building.
It's empty.

21:42.330 --> 21:43.570
We're about to
call in T.I.D.

21:43.570 --> 21:44.870
Negative.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.200
You're to exit the building
immediately

21:46.200 --> 21:47.410
and come back
to the station.

21:47.410 --> 21:48.990
Sir?

21:48.990 --> 21:51.490
Shut it down
and get back here -- now.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.530
What the hell's going on?

21:56.120 --> 21:57.950
Got a call
from the Chief.

21:57.950 --> 22:01.410
Your search warrant rang
an alarm way up the food chain.

22:01.410 --> 22:03.910
So we're just supposed
to walk away from
a murder investigation?

22:03.910 --> 22:05.910
No, but you can't follow
it down this path.

22:05.910 --> 22:07.160
And what if that path
leads us to our killer?

22:11.120 --> 22:13.280
So, what are we
into, Sarge?

22:13.280 --> 22:14.740
I don't know.

22:14.740 --> 22:16.910
And I pushed hard
to find out.

22:16.910 --> 22:19.490
But this comes from on high,
and it's non-negotiable.

22:19.490 --> 22:22.280
Let's take the night.
We'll regroup in the morning.

22:24.490 --> 22:25.990
That's it.

22:25.990 --> 22:27.410
Hey, this isn't right.

22:27.410 --> 22:29.490
No. But it's
a direct order.

22:33.570 --> 22:35.530
So, that's it?

22:35.530 --> 22:37.410
We walk away?

22:37.410 --> 22:38.870
If we're smart.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.910
That's...not a yes.

22:46.370 --> 22:47.490
What do you think?

22:47.490 --> 22:49.200
That this is clearly
a federal operation

22:49.200 --> 22:51.370
and that we don't have
enough information
to know how to proceed.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.120
So we get more.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.330
How do we get insight on
a federal operation, Boot?

22:59.330 --> 23:00.870
Uh...

23:00.870 --> 23:02.120
we call LA CLEAR.

23:02.120 --> 23:02.950
Exactly.

23:02.950 --> 23:04.410
You sure?

23:04.410 --> 23:05.780
Yeah.
I owe Mitch that much.

23:07.030 --> 23:08.370
You remember
the personal questions

23:08.370 --> 23:09.620
they ask you
for clearance, right?

23:09.620 --> 23:10.910
Yeah.

23:10.910 --> 23:13.330
Maybe you should all...
step outside.

23:13.330 --> 23:14.330
Not a chance.

23:14.330 --> 23:15.830
I think you sh--

23:15.830 --> 23:17.070
Yeah, hi.
Hello?

23:17.070 --> 23:19.620
Uh, this is
Officer Tim Bradford, LAPD,

23:19.620 --> 23:21.620
badge 34831.

23:22.830 --> 23:23.990
Yeah. Go ahead.

23:25.030 --> 23:27.070
Bethesda. Mm.

23:27.070 --> 23:28.490
Left clavicle.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.240
Uh, "Lady Marmalade."

23:33.120 --> 23:34.620
Uh, tarantulas.

23:34.620 --> 23:36.280
Uh, yeah,
it's, uh, "Xanadu."

23:36.280 --> 23:37.990
"Xanadu"?

23:39.530 --> 23:41.870
Yes, uh, ma'am, I'd like
to run an address.

23:41.870 --> 23:44.870
214 Mill Street,
Los Angeles.

23:44.870 --> 23:46.240
Okay, thank you.

23:46.240 --> 23:47.530
Well?

23:47.530 --> 23:48.620
They'll get back to us
within the hour.

23:55.030 --> 23:56.530
Hello, dog.

23:57.660 --> 23:59.370
You are pretty cute.

24:06.870 --> 24:08.870
I am so sorry.

24:08.870 --> 24:11.200
I meant to call you earlier,
but today has been crazy.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.740
He ate my stuff!
All of my stuff!

24:13.740 --> 24:15.780
I know. I'll pay
to replace everything.

24:15.780 --> 24:18.160
You can't replace
my letter jacket!

24:18.160 --> 24:20.280
Okay.
The dog has to go.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.910
What?! No!

24:21.910 --> 24:23.780
Look, this is what happens
when you have a dog.

24:23.780 --> 24:26.280
No, I don't have a dog, Lucy!
You do!

24:26.280 --> 24:27.740
I got to go and see
what's salvageable.

24:27.740 --> 24:28.490
Wait.

24:28.490 --> 24:29.490
Um...

24:29.490 --> 24:31.280
Uh...

24:31.280 --> 24:32.990
will you take him
for a walk?

24:33.870 --> 24:35.200
Jackson?

24:35.200 --> 24:36.490
H-Hello?

24:46.490 --> 24:48.910
Alright.
You're free to go.

24:48.910 --> 24:50.660
Does that mean you caught
the guys that killed Joe?

24:50.660 --> 24:51.830
Not yet.

24:51.830 --> 24:53.240
But you found the money?

24:54.870 --> 24:55.990
No.

24:55.990 --> 24:57.660
It was gone.

24:57.660 --> 24:59.330
W-We're working late.

24:59.330 --> 25:00.370
S-So what now?

25:02.120 --> 25:03.330
Now you go home.

25:04.910 --> 25:06.280
I'm -- I'm sorry.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.490
I-I can help you
find a bed and a shelter.

25:08.490 --> 25:10.700
You really want to do
something for me?

25:10.700 --> 25:12.870
You find out who
killed Joe, alright?

25:12.870 --> 25:14.490
He was a good guy.

25:14.490 --> 25:16.410
He served his
country with honor.

25:16.410 --> 25:18.240
He didn't deserve
to go out like that.

25:20.660 --> 25:22.450
I-I'm sorry.
I have to answer this.

25:22.450 --> 25:24.070
She'll escort you out.

25:24.070 --> 25:25.870
You take care
of yourself.

25:26.910 --> 25:28.120
Yeah, it's Tim Bradford.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.450
LA CLEAR code 9273.

25:38.740 --> 25:40.330
It's a D.I.A. operation.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.330
Defense Intelligence
Agency?

25:42.330 --> 25:44.280
That's national security.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.830
LA CLEAR tell you
anything else?

25:45.830 --> 25:48.120
Just a contact name --
Colonel Norman Jangus.

25:49.620 --> 25:51.240
What the hell is
a national security agency

25:51.240 --> 25:52.700
doing counterfeiting money?

25:52.700 --> 25:54.240
This is way bigger
than we thought.

25:54.240 --> 25:56.120
We should take the night,
like Grey said,

25:56.120 --> 25:57.700
and see how we are feeling
in the morning.

25:57.700 --> 25:58.830
Harper's right.

25:58.830 --> 26:00.530
Conducting
an off-the-books operation

26:00.530 --> 26:01.830
is high-risk on a good day.

26:01.830 --> 26:02.870
And this ain't a good day.

26:12.530 --> 26:13.870
Nnh.

26:35.570 --> 26:37.410
Hey, pal.

26:37.410 --> 26:38.990
We need to talk.

26:42.230 --> 26:43.780
Invite me in?

26:43.780 --> 26:45.480
How 'bout you tell me
who you are first?

26:47.610 --> 26:49.780
Right now,
I'm your friend, John.

26:49.780 --> 26:51.520
And that's a good thing.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.780
'Cause you don't want me
as an enemy.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.980
Now invite me in.

27:04.350 --> 27:06.770
Nice place.

27:06.770 --> 27:09.390
Done good work
fixing it up.

27:09.390 --> 27:11.270
I'd expect no less,
based on your history.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.680
I see your play --

27:14.680 --> 27:17.640
come in, walk around,
assert dominance.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.470
Very nice.

27:19.470 --> 27:21.810
So, tell me, who is
Colonel Norman Jangus?

27:21.810 --> 27:24.140
Oh, a name on a form.
Nothing more.

27:24.140 --> 27:25.430
But you are D.I.A.

27:25.430 --> 27:28.310
Yeah, but my team operates
in the shadows.

27:28.310 --> 27:31.680
We do stuff
no one wants to admit.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.640
So, why come for me?

27:33.640 --> 27:36.890
'Cause you're the weak link.

27:36.890 --> 27:39.310
Bradford served two tours
in country,

27:39.310 --> 27:42.060
Harper's taken on cartels,

27:42.060 --> 27:44.810
and -- and Chen survived
a serial killer.

27:44.810 --> 27:46.310
You...

27:46.310 --> 27:47.970
built houses.

27:49.680 --> 27:52.140
And you always push
on the weak link.

27:52.140 --> 27:54.140
So...

27:54.140 --> 27:56.230
I'm pushing on you.

27:58.560 --> 27:59.930
What do you want?

27:59.930 --> 28:02.770
To warn you
and your little cop buddies.

28:02.770 --> 28:06.520
Just...leave this alone.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.430
Calling LA CLEAR?

28:08.430 --> 28:10.020
Big mistake.

28:10.020 --> 28:11.600
Let it be your last.

28:11.600 --> 28:14.180
All we want is whoever
killed Joe Delacruz.

28:14.180 --> 28:16.020
The homeless guy?

28:16.020 --> 28:16.810
Why?

28:16.810 --> 28:18.970
He was a human being.

28:18.970 --> 28:20.730
The man was a soldier.
He sacrificed --

28:20.730 --> 28:23.730
Time-out, time-out.
Let's understand something here.

28:23.730 --> 28:25.310
We're on the same team.

28:25.310 --> 28:27.390
You, me, Joe?

28:27.390 --> 28:30.970
We make sacrifices on the daily
to save people's lives.

28:30.970 --> 28:34.770
I just do it on a more...
global scale than you.

28:34.770 --> 28:37.180
And that's why it's okay
for you to murder people?

28:37.180 --> 28:39.730
There are casualties
in every war.

28:39.730 --> 28:43.310
You just really don't want
the next one to be you.

28:57.810 --> 28:59.680
You get
the tracking device on his car?

28:59.680 --> 29:02.060
Yeah. We can follow him
wherever he goes.

29:02.060 --> 29:03.850
Great.
Let's hit the road.
Alright.

29:03.850 --> 29:06.350
No. This is
a two-person job.

29:06.350 --> 29:07.930
Harper and I got it
from here.

29:07.930 --> 29:10.470
Uh, screw that.
You go, we go.

29:10.470 --> 29:13.180
That's admirable, really,
but if this thing goes sideways,

29:13.180 --> 29:15.850
we could face demotion,
suspension, even jail.

29:17.020 --> 29:18.350
I've got a golden ticket.

29:18.350 --> 29:20.640
Bradford has
an unblemished record.

29:20.640 --> 29:22.600
Odds are we can
weather the storm.

29:22.600 --> 29:25.060
Rookies are
at-will employees.

29:25.060 --> 29:27.060
They don't even need
a reason to fire you.

29:27.060 --> 29:28.810
Okay, well,
with all due respect,

29:28.810 --> 29:31.600
I've been buried alive
by a serial killer.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.270
This rabbit hole
does not scare me.

29:33.270 --> 29:35.970
I love this job more
than I imagined I could.

29:35.970 --> 29:38.230
The day I stop giving it my all
is the day I walk away.

29:41.140 --> 29:42.230
Alright.

29:42.230 --> 29:43.270
Let's roll.

29:43.270 --> 29:45.390
And hope he leads us
to the money.

30:09.430 --> 30:10.640
We're in position.

30:10.640 --> 30:12.020
Copy that.

30:13.390 --> 30:16.180
Why are you the reason
Mitch lost his leg?

30:18.730 --> 30:21.600
'Cause I let him slide
on something.

30:21.600 --> 30:22.970
It doesn't matter what,

30:22.970 --> 30:26.390
just that I cut him a break
when I shouldn't have,

30:26.390 --> 30:29.180
and because I did,
he went back out on patrol,

30:29.180 --> 30:30.560
got blown up.

30:32.470 --> 30:35.560
That is the most Tim Bradford
thing I've ever heard.

30:35.560 --> 30:37.930
You showed humanity.

30:37.930 --> 30:39.430
There's nothing
to feel guilty about.

30:39.430 --> 30:40.810
Rules matter, Boot.

30:42.810 --> 30:44.810
Then what the hell
are you doing out here?

30:46.520 --> 30:48.640
Some things matter more.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.850
Bradford, Chen, let's go.

30:50.850 --> 30:51.890
Hang on.

30:51.890 --> 30:54.020
First lesson
in black ops --

30:54.020 --> 30:56.930
make sure the lights don't
come on when you open the door.

31:35.770 --> 31:37.520
That's got to be
the pallets of money.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.180
Waiting to put it on a ship
to who knows where.

31:40.180 --> 31:42.180
Should we call
Long Beach PD?

31:42.180 --> 31:43.810
Not yet.
Why not?

31:43.810 --> 31:46.020
Well, for one thing,
we don't know if that's
the counterfeit money.

31:46.020 --> 31:47.180
Pallets are covered.

31:47.180 --> 31:48.850
We've only got
one shot at this.

31:48.850 --> 31:50.640
We absolutely
cannot be wrong.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.850
So we confirm it's
the counterfeit money

31:52.850 --> 31:54.310
before we call in
the cavalry,

31:54.310 --> 31:56.600
use the arrest to figure out
who killed Joe.

31:56.600 --> 31:57.770
Exactly.

31:57.770 --> 31:59.520
So,
how do we do that?

31:59.520 --> 32:00.520
No idea.

32:04.430 --> 32:06.560
Forklift stopped working.

32:06.560 --> 32:08.770
Something's up.

32:08.770 --> 32:10.970
-There, I guess.
-Yeah, I'll get that.

32:13.060 --> 32:15.770
-Let me grab.
-Grab another one.

32:15.770 --> 32:16.970
They're getting
a new forklift.

32:25.100 --> 32:27.560
Now's our chance.
Let's move.

32:45.270 --> 32:48.060
I'll take it from here.
Watch my six.

33:18.730 --> 33:20.470
You'll be dead before
you break leather.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.370
John, what the hell?

33:37.580 --> 33:38.540
I warned you.

33:38.540 --> 33:39.870
You did.

33:39.870 --> 33:41.450
But you didn't listen.

33:41.450 --> 33:42.450
I didn't.

33:42.450 --> 33:44.290
I'm disappointed.

33:44.290 --> 33:45.540
Thought you were smart.

33:45.540 --> 33:46.700
No.

33:46.700 --> 33:47.870
Smart one's my T.O.

33:47.870 --> 33:49.410
She plans for everything.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.500
That's a .50 cal.

34:00.540 --> 34:01.580
I don't need to tell you

34:01.580 --> 34:03.740
what that bullet will do
to your body.

34:03.740 --> 34:05.580
Hey, Pettigrew,

34:05.580 --> 34:09.000
didn't we face this exact
scenario down in Colombia?

34:09.000 --> 34:11.540
Yeah.
We're all still here.

34:11.540 --> 34:14.040
'Cause it's
a no-win situation.

34:14.040 --> 34:15.620
Your shooter turns me
into mist,

34:15.620 --> 34:17.659
but my guys turn you
into organ donors.

34:17.659 --> 34:20.040
So what we need is
a negotiated settlement.

34:21.330 --> 34:23.239
I'm listening.

34:23.239 --> 34:26.239
One of you killed
Joe Delacruz.

34:26.239 --> 34:28.659
You give him up,
we walk away.

34:28.659 --> 34:30.659
And the money?

34:30.659 --> 34:31.540
Not our problem.

34:31.540 --> 34:32.830
Tim.

34:32.830 --> 34:34.330
Not our problem.

34:46.739 --> 34:48.040
Fine.

34:49.040 --> 34:50.080
Pettigrew.

34:51.500 --> 34:53.239
Surrender yourself.

34:53.239 --> 34:54.120
What?

34:55.659 --> 34:57.200
After everything
we've been through,

34:57.200 --> 34:58.620
you're just gonna
turn me in like that?

34:58.620 --> 35:00.740
Your sloppiness jeopardized
our operation,

35:00.740 --> 35:03.200
so you are being sacrificed
for the greater good.

35:03.200 --> 35:06.740
But all they have is
circumstantial evidence.

35:06.740 --> 35:09.950
So keep your mouth shut,
listen to the lawyer,

35:09.950 --> 35:12.120
and you'll be out
in no time.

35:12.120 --> 35:13.620
Yes, sir.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.200
We good?

35:35.500 --> 35:37.120
Alright,
let's get this done.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.450
What happens
with the money?

35:39.450 --> 35:42.450
It'll fund black ops
for the next five years.

35:42.450 --> 35:45.740
The U.S. government spends
billions in covert operations.

35:45.740 --> 35:48.240
I bet Bradford here

35:48.240 --> 35:50.080
watched backpacks
full of ghost money

35:50.080 --> 35:51.120
being handed out
in Afghanistan.

35:51.120 --> 35:52.660
I did.

35:52.660 --> 35:54.790
See, that money has to be
authorized and tracked.

35:54.790 --> 35:56.450
But counterfeit money
doesn't.

35:56.450 --> 35:58.330
We didn't print money.

35:58.330 --> 36:00.290
We printed freedom.

36:00.290 --> 36:01.830
Alright,
let's wrap this up.

36:08.040 --> 36:11.950
Let me get this straight.

36:11.950 --> 36:16.620
You all just happened to be
taking a stroll on the docks,

36:16.620 --> 36:20.000
and Joe Delacruz's killer
appears and turns himself in?

36:20.000 --> 36:21.660
Yes, sir.

36:21.660 --> 36:23.740
And when the Chief calls me
tomorrow screaming --

36:23.740 --> 36:24.790
He won't.

36:32.370 --> 36:34.910
I'm going back to bed.

36:34.910 --> 36:36.540
The paperwork on this
better be spotless.

36:36.540 --> 36:37.830
Yes, sir.

36:50.830 --> 36:52.080
Where's the dog?

36:53.370 --> 36:54.910
Gone.

36:54.910 --> 36:56.330
Really?

36:56.330 --> 36:57.950
Yeah.

36:57.950 --> 36:59.830
It wasn't fair to you,

36:59.830 --> 37:04.160
and I'm really not ready
for a dog yet.

37:04.160 --> 37:07.290
I'm sorry about
your stuff.

37:09.620 --> 37:11.290
Look.

37:11.290 --> 37:12.700
I'm sorry, too.

37:13.700 --> 37:14.620
I actually liked Kojo.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.000

38:12.910 --> 38:14.290
I broke the rules
to catch Rosalind.

38:15.540 --> 38:17.830
I went into her house
without a warrant

38:17.830 --> 38:19.830
and used what I found there
to get one.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.790
Somehow, she knew.

38:21.790 --> 38:23.330
She never said anything.

38:23.330 --> 38:25.040
Would she have gone
free if she had?

38:25.040 --> 38:26.580
No.

38:26.580 --> 38:28.580
At this point,
we'd caught her red-handed.

38:28.580 --> 38:30.120

39:53.660 --> 39:56.120
You have to find a way
to listen to your body.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.370
I just had a patient

39:58.370 --> 40:00.370
who had been feeling off
for a couple weeks.

40:00.370 --> 40:02.080
He didn't
go to the doctor.

40:02.080 --> 40:04.000
We found a tumor.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.450
We caught it just in time.

40:06.450 --> 40:08.330
Because he listened
to his body?

40:08.330 --> 40:09.790
No, I mean a bullet
fell from the sky

40:09.790 --> 40:11.410
and punctured his skull.

40:11.410 --> 40:13.830
When we did the X-ray,
we found a mass.

40:13.830 --> 40:16.410
I mean, that bullet
saved his life.

40:16.410 --> 40:18.620
So the moral
of the story is...

40:18.620 --> 40:21.120
Don't count on a stray bullet
to save your life.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.660
