WEBVTT

00:02.583 --> 00:05.916
LOKI: So, you're part of the TVA's
courageous and dedicated workforce?

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
Yes.

00:07.083 --> 00:09.166
You were created by the Time-Keepers?

00:09.250 --> 00:10.250
Correct.

00:14.250 --> 00:16.458
RAVONNA: You're not the only analyst
working for me.

00:16.541 --> 00:18.958
But, would you say,
maybe, I'm your favorite one?

00:19.041 --> 00:20.750
LOKI: Enchantment is a clever trick.

00:20.833 --> 00:23.875
SYLVIE: I have to create a fantasy
from their memories.

00:23.958 --> 00:27.333
That young soldier from the TVA,
she was just a regular person on Earth.

00:32.458 --> 00:35.458
Of all of the apocalypses
saved on that TemPad, this is the worst!

00:35.541 --> 00:37.250
No one makes it off here!

00:37.333 --> 00:38.333
LOKI: How long do we have?

00:38.416 --> 00:41.416
SYLVIE: Twelve hours or so.
Things down hereare only gonna get worse.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.625
To the end of the world.

01:55.666 --> 01:57.833
Dragon swoops towards the palace,

01:57.916 --> 02:02.416
the Valkyrie flies over,
defeats the dragon, and saves Asgard.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.416
There's our Variant.

02:06.875 --> 02:08.500
On the authority of the Time-Keepers,

02:08.583 --> 02:11.250
I hereby arrest you for crimes
against the Sacred Timeline.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.875
Reset it.

02:13.958 --> 02:14.958
Wait!

02:42.291 --> 02:43.291
MAN: No! No!

02:48.250 --> 02:49.666
Help him!

03:05.625 --> 03:06.916
Next case!

03:10.000 --> 03:11.916
-Next case!
-Right here!

04:19.291 --> 04:20.958
What'd they say? Are you okay?

04:21.041 --> 04:22.916
No, no, Mobius. I'm not.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.625
Under the best of circumstances,

04:24.708 --> 04:26.625
it's jarring to stand
before the Time-Keepers.

04:26.708 --> 04:28.625
And this is not the best of circumstances.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.583
Yeah, but they can't blame you.

04:30.666 --> 04:33.000
They can and do.

04:33.083 --> 04:34.916
The Variant was right here.

04:35.833 --> 04:37.916
What if she got to the Time-Keepers?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.416
I know. But she didn't.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.375
No. But she got away.

04:41.458 --> 04:44.708
Along with the Variant that
I got you permission to bring in here.

04:46.958 --> 04:51.208
Do you have any idea how impossible it is
to keep the timeline stable?

04:52.208 --> 04:55.250
The Time-Keepers are all that stand
between us and full-scale calamity.

04:55.333 --> 04:57.041
And I'm glad they're on our side.

04:57.125 --> 04:59.416
But if they want me
to find Loki and the Variant,

04:59.500 --> 05:01.791
I need access to Hunter C-20.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.541
I'm sorry, but that's impossible.

05:03.625 --> 05:06.833
Look, when we found her,
she kept saying, "It's real. It's real."

05:07.375 --> 05:10.250
Over and over.
I need to find out what that meant

05:10.333 --> 05:12.500
and what else she saw
when she was with the Variant.

05:12.583 --> 05:15.583
Look, I know there's protocol,
but she could have information...

05:15.666 --> 05:17.583
She's dead, Mobius!

05:18.416 --> 05:20.083
What? How?

05:22.791 --> 05:29.458
The Variant, she enchanted C-20,
scrambled her mind.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.541
I don't get it. She seemed okay.
She seemed fine.

05:35.625 --> 05:37.166
RAVONNA: At first, yes.

05:37.250 --> 05:39.791
But by the time she got in here,
she could barely speak.

05:41.458 --> 05:43.750
The decline was steeper after that.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.708
-I didn't know. What...
-Nobody does.

05:48.125 --> 05:49.875
We don't want people to panic.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.791
Can I trust you to keep that between us?

05:53.875 --> 05:55.083
Of course. Yes.

05:56.375 --> 05:57.375
I'm sorry.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.791
Every moment those Variants are out there,

06:01.875 --> 06:03.250
we're all in danger.

06:04.083 --> 06:05.125
Find them!

06:56.000 --> 06:57.291
I'm sorry.

07:04.916 --> 07:06.791
I remember Asgard.

07:07.375 --> 07:09.833
Not much, but I remember.

07:10.333 --> 07:15.041
My home, my people, my life.

07:19.833 --> 07:24.833
The universe wants to break free,
so it manifests chaos.

07:25.875 --> 07:28.500
Like me being born
the Goddess of Mischief.

07:30.166 --> 07:35.375
And as soon as that created a big enough
detour from the Sacred Timeline,

07:35.458 --> 07:40.791
the TVA showed up, erased my reality,
and took me prisoner.

07:42.833 --> 07:44.625
I was just a child.

07:46.916 --> 07:47.916
I escaped.

07:49.333 --> 07:56.208
Stole a TemPad and I ran for a long,
long time, which really sucked.

07:56.958 --> 08:00.875
Everywhere and every-when I went,
it caused a nexus event.

08:01.791 --> 08:03.416
Sent up a smoke flare.

08:05.958 --> 08:08.458
Because I'm not supposed to exist.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.750
Until, eventually,
I figured out where to hide.

08:13.583 --> 08:16.000
And so that's where I grew up,

08:16.083 --> 08:18.333
the ends of a thousand worlds.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.541
Now...

08:23.666 --> 08:25.458
...that's where I'll die.

08:32.666 --> 08:34.041
ANALYST 1: There's nothing, sir.

08:34.125 --> 08:36.625
MOBIUS: Even with
the magnified nexus threshold?

08:36.707 --> 08:39.791
That one should be setting off alarms
if somebody steps on the wrong leaf.

08:39.875 --> 08:42.125
ANALYST 2: Wherever they are,
I'm not sure anything survives.

08:42.207 --> 08:45.333
Yeah. Don't underestimate them.
You see anything down at Roxxcart?

08:45.416 --> 08:46.625
They're gone.

08:46.708 --> 08:49.958
Leaping across time,
plotting their next massacre.

08:53.958 --> 08:55.250
Any news on C-20?

08:56.958 --> 08:58.000
No.

08:59.916 --> 09:01.708
We need to find them.

09:02.916 --> 09:04.666
We will.

09:26.208 --> 09:27.208
SYLVIE: Not long now.

09:33.750 --> 09:36.750
Do you think that what makes a Loki a Loki

09:36.833 --> 09:39.833
is the fact that we're destined to lose?

09:39.916 --> 09:41.625
LOKI: No.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.333
We may lose.

09:45.333 --> 09:46.875
Sometimes painfully.

09:48.916 --> 09:50.458
But we don't die.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.541
We survive.

09:53.625 --> 09:55.125
I mean, you did.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.750
You were just a child
when the TVA took you,

09:57.833 --> 10:01.750
but you nearly took down the organization
that claims to govern the order of time.

10:01.833 --> 10:02.833
You did it on your own.

10:02.916 --> 10:05.041
You ran rings around them. You're amazing!

10:11.958 --> 10:13.500
We've got something.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.541
ANALYST 1: Temporal lock.

10:38.250 --> 10:41.875
Okay, that's not someone
stepping on the wrong leaf.

10:41.958 --> 10:44.250
You ever seen a branch like that?

10:44.333 --> 10:45.708
No.

11:18.541 --> 11:20.000
MOBIUS: Well?
LOKI: Well, what?

11:20.083 --> 11:21.958
I know you got some quip
you're dyin' to say.

11:22.041 --> 11:24.041
I don't have a quip.
I've got nothing to say.

11:24.125 --> 11:25.125
Come on.

11:25.250 --> 11:28.250
By the way, I should have an equal amount
of security. This is insulting!

11:28.333 --> 11:29.791
You just can't help yourself.

11:29.916 --> 11:31.541
-You betrayed me!
-You betrayed me!

11:31.625 --> 11:33.125
-Grow up!
-You grow up.

11:33.666 --> 11:37.125
MOBIUS: You know, it occurred to me that
you're not really the God of Mischief.

11:37.208 --> 11:38.958
LOKI: Oh, here it comes.

11:39.083 --> 11:42.875
The folksy, dopey insult
from the folksy dope.

11:42.958 --> 11:47.125
What am I? The God of Self-Sabotage, yeah?
The God of Back-Stabbing?

11:47.208 --> 11:50.250
Just kind of an asshole and a bad friend.

11:50.333 --> 11:54.166
Yeah, chew on that for a little bit.
All right. It's ready.

11:54.833 --> 11:55.833
What is this?

11:55.916 --> 11:57.500
You'll see.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.791
-Mobius!
-Okay. No, no, no, let him,

11:59.875 --> 12:03.083
one last desperate trick
from the desperate trickster. Go ahead.

12:03.166 --> 12:06.833
The TVA is lying to you.

12:09.333 --> 12:10.333
Put him in.

12:17.625 --> 12:18.625
What?

12:22.791 --> 12:23.916
Seriously?

12:28.291 --> 12:29.666
You.

12:30.625 --> 12:31.625
Sif.

12:31.708 --> 12:35.041
You conniving, craven, pathetic worm.

12:35.125 --> 12:36.708
-You did this.
-What?

12:37.875 --> 12:38.916
LOKI: Ow.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.583
I hope you know you deserve to be alone
and you always will be.

12:42.666 --> 12:43.833
All right.

12:43.916 --> 12:46.416
A bad memory prison? How quaint.

12:51.125 --> 12:52.291
LOKI: Ow!

12:59.708 --> 13:01.791
I remember exactly what I did after that.

13:01.875 --> 13:03.583
I went and had a nice, hot bath

13:03.666 --> 13:08.250
and a glass of wine,
and I never thought about it again,

13:08.333 --> 13:10.458
because it was just a bit of fun.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.333
-SIF: You.
-Huh?

13:15.416 --> 13:19.333
You conniving, craven, pathetic worm.
You did this.

13:19.416 --> 13:21.208
Hang on. Ow.

13:21.291 --> 13:24.166
I hope you know you deserve to be alone
and you always will be.

13:24.250 --> 13:25.500
Just...

13:35.958 --> 13:39.375
Time loops. How lovely.

13:42.291 --> 13:43.375
You.

13:43.500 --> 13:46.166
You conniving, craven, pathetic worm.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.000
Okay. Okay, Sif. Hang on.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.208
No, you hear this.
You deserve to be alone...

13:52.291 --> 13:54.541
And I always will be.
All right, I get it.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.541
Listen. You are a reconstruction
of a past event

13:57.625 --> 14:01.125
created by the organization
that controls all of time.

14:01.208 --> 14:05.791
So you need to trust me
and you need to help me escape. Yeah?

14:10.666 --> 14:12.000
Okay, good.

14:16.708 --> 14:18.416
Pathetic.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.791
Hey.

14:26.583 --> 14:28.583
Shouldn't you be interrogating
the Loki Variant?

14:28.666 --> 14:30.416
He's softening in the Time Cell,

14:30.500 --> 14:33.666
but while he marinates, I thought
maybe I'd interview the other Variant.

14:33.750 --> 14:38.958
Oh, no. Just stick with your Loki
and figure out what that nexus spike was.

14:39.041 --> 14:42.250
I know, but I think I can get there faster
if I work 'em both together.

14:42.333 --> 14:45.000
You said we have a part to play,
and the part I play...

14:45.083 --> 14:47.958
Absolutely not. She's just too dangerous.

14:48.041 --> 14:51.000
Too dangerous? Come on, Ravonna.
This is what I do.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.333
And this is what I do.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.500
Nobody speaks with that Variant.

14:57.625 --> 15:00.666
I mean, if there's a mastermind here,
I don't think it's Loki.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.041
Good.

15:02.125 --> 15:04.333
Then he should be the easiest to break.

15:04.958 --> 15:08.333
Work your Loki and figure out
what caused that spike.

15:08.416 --> 15:10.208
Time-Keepers are watching, Mobius.

15:10.291 --> 15:13.500
They're always watching.
"Work your Loki, work your Loki."

15:13.583 --> 15:15.083
That ought to be my mantra.

15:19.791 --> 15:20.875
You all right?

15:22.041 --> 15:23.833
-Is she in there?
-Mm-hmm.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
They don't go gently, do they?

15:27.083 --> 15:30.416
Aren't you supposed to be
interrogating your Variant pet?

15:30.500 --> 15:32.625
Just stretching my legs.

15:32.708 --> 15:36.000
You know, we brought in Kree,
Titans, vampires.

15:36.083 --> 15:39.500
Why is it the two orphan demigods
are such a pain in the ass?

15:39.583 --> 15:42.041
And yet it was your idea
to bring in another one.

15:44.416 --> 15:46.458
I'm happy to share credit for that idea.

15:46.541 --> 15:48.125
Mobius?

15:49.666 --> 15:52.208
Did Loki say anything
while you were in there?

15:52.333 --> 15:54.958
Yeah. He said the TVA is lying to me.

15:57.166 --> 15:58.166
Why?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.416
Just doing my job.

16:10.250 --> 16:12.208
-SIF: You.
-

16:12.291 --> 16:13.791
You conniving, craven...

16:13.875 --> 16:15.416
-Sif. Sif.
-...pathetic worm.

16:15.500 --> 16:19.666
Please, please, no more.
Please, I beg you.

16:19.750 --> 16:23.833
I'm a horrible person.
I get it. I really am.

16:23.916 --> 16:27.916
I cut off your hair
because I thought it'd be funny.

16:29.583 --> 16:31.041
And it's not.

16:32.750 --> 16:33.750
Uh...

16:35.791 --> 16:37.291
I crave attention...

16:40.708 --> 16:42.083
because I'm...

16:43.458 --> 16:44.875
I'm a... I'm a narcissist.

16:48.500 --> 16:49.916
And I suppose it's...

16:53.333 --> 16:55.333
It's because I'm scared of being alone.

17:17.040 --> 17:21.375
You are alone and you always will be.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.458
Okay, Loki.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.083
You ready to talk?

17:53.375 --> 17:54.875
Fancy technology.

17:55.916 --> 17:58.458
Threatening interrogation tactics.

17:59.291 --> 18:01.958
Seems you and I are in a loop of our own.

18:02.041 --> 18:05.041
Well, there's been a lot of water
under the bridge since then.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.125
LOKI: Certainly has.

18:06.208 --> 18:09.625
Okay, you said the TVA is lying to me.
Go ahead.

18:09.708 --> 18:13.541
Or is that just a cockroach's
survival mechanism kicking in?

18:13.625 --> 18:16.291
Let me out of this place,
stop beating me up, and I'll tell you.

18:16.375 --> 18:17.875
Cockroach. Got it.

18:17.958 --> 18:20.333
How long have you been
working for the Variant?

18:20.416 --> 18:22.750
Me? Working for her? Please.

18:22.833 --> 18:27.291
If you're not working for the Variant,
what is it? You're partners?

18:27.375 --> 18:28.708
Absolutely not.

18:30.041 --> 18:34.458
She's difficult and irritating,

18:34.541 --> 18:36.666
and she tries to hit me all the time.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.375
No. Not partners, no.

18:40.458 --> 18:42.375
Yeah, I guess you don't do partners.

18:42.458 --> 18:44.333
Unless, of course, it benefits you,

18:44.416 --> 18:46.708
and you intend to betray them
at some point.

18:46.791 --> 18:49.125
It was a means to an end, Mobius.

18:49.208 --> 18:50.833
Welcome to the real world.

18:50.916 --> 18:53.250
Down there, we're awful
to get what we want.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.333
Now I gotta have a prince tell me
how the real world works?

18:56.416 --> 19:00.083
Why don't you just tell me what caused
the nexus event on Lamentis?

19:00.166 --> 19:01.291
Let me say this again.

19:01.375 --> 19:03.250
I'm not going to tell you

19:03.333 --> 19:06.791
just so you can turn around
immediately afterwards and prune me.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.875
I guess we've reached a dead end then.

19:08.958 --> 19:10.000
Okay, it's over.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.500
I'm going to miss
these little tete-a-tetes.

19:12.625 --> 19:13.625
LOKI: Me, too.

19:14.625 --> 19:18.583
One guy playing checkers, you,
old Mobius playing chess,

19:18.666 --> 19:23.250
but, yeah, give my regards to Lady Sif.

19:23.416 --> 19:25.125
What... No. What? No, no, no.

19:25.208 --> 19:29.083
Please, not...
Well, just wait, wait, wait.

19:30.208 --> 19:31.208
Yeah?

19:33.458 --> 19:37.416
Of course it was me
pulling the strings all along.

19:38.625 --> 19:42.875
She came to me on Asgard a long time ago

19:43.833 --> 19:46.875
and then she took me
to one of her apocalypses

19:46.958 --> 19:50.458
and that's where
we hatched our plan together.

19:51.333 --> 19:52.333
Which is?

19:52.416 --> 19:54.708
Coming along very nicely, thank you.

19:55.708 --> 19:56.958
MOBIUS: And the Variant?

19:57.041 --> 19:59.000
Doesn't matter. She's a pawn.

20:00.083 --> 20:03.000
Something very, very big is gonna happen.

20:03.083 --> 20:05.958
And when it does, I'll dispose of her.

20:06.083 --> 20:07.833
Well, we saved you the trouble there.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.458
She's already been pruned.

20:09.541 --> 20:13.333
-So assume I do set you free.
-Hang on, wait.

20:13.416 --> 20:17.000
-What'd you just say?
-What? Assume I do set you free.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.125
LOKI: The Variant. She's gone?

20:19.208 --> 20:22.500
Yeah. Not before she took out two of ours.

20:22.625 --> 20:25.291
Yeah, she was going
to her Time Cell, broke free.

20:25.375 --> 20:28.750
Hunter B-15 stepped in, popped her.

20:28.833 --> 20:32.500
So you might want to fire off
a thank you note to Hunter B-15,

20:32.583 --> 20:35.916
because it looks like
you're the superior Loki.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.708
I would've bet on her,
but that's what makes a horse race.

20:42.583 --> 20:43.708
Good riddance.

20:54.750 --> 20:57.000
-What's so funny?
-Come on.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.791
Look at your eyes. You like her.

20:59.875 --> 21:02.916
-What?
-You like her. Does she like you?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.166
-LOKI: Was she pruned?
-No wonder you have no clue

21:05.250 --> 21:06.875
what caused the nexus event
on Lamentis.

21:06.958 --> 21:08.875
Both of you are swooning over each other.

21:08.958 --> 21:10.708
-LOKI: Tell me the truth.
-It's the apocalypse.

21:10.791 --> 21:13.500
Two Variants of the same being,

21:13.583 --> 21:18.458
especially you, forming this kind of sick,
twisted romantic relationship.

21:18.541 --> 21:21.375
That's pure chaos.
That could break reality.

21:21.458 --> 21:23.541
It's breaking my reality right now.

21:23.625 --> 21:27.541
What a incredible seismic narcissist.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.291
You fell for yourself.

21:29.375 --> 21:30.916
Her name was Sylvie.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.625
Ah, Sylvie.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.250
Lovely.

21:34.333 --> 21:38.125
How do you spell that?
Is that with an I-E or just an I?

21:38.208 --> 21:39.500
Is she alive?

21:41.708 --> 21:42.875
For now.

21:46.750 --> 21:51.000
And was infiltrating the TVA,
was that always sort of the grand plan?

21:51.708 --> 21:53.375
Our interests are aligned.

21:53.458 --> 21:56.583
-MOBIUS: Overthrowing the Time-Keepers?
-Maybe they need to be overthrown.

21:56.666 --> 21:58.916
-I ought to box your ears.
-LOKI: Mobius, listen.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.041
If what Sylvie told me about this place
is true, it affects all of us.

22:03.125 --> 22:07.041
Here we go. Now, you've already told me
about 50 lies in the past 10 minutes.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.500
-I'm not lying.
-Now, I'm supposed

22:08.583 --> 22:10.708
-to believe your girlfriend.
-It's the truth.

22:10.791 --> 22:13.458
-She's not my girlfriend.
-Whatever you want to call her.

22:13.541 --> 22:16.208
What, your female self that
you have some demented crush on...

22:16.291 --> 22:18.541
You're all Variants!

22:18.625 --> 22:20.916
Everyone who works at the TVA.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.916
The Time-Keepers didn't create you.
They kidnapped you from the timeline,

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
and erased your memories.

22:28.750 --> 22:32.125
Memories she can access
through enchantment.

22:34.958 --> 22:40.791
So before this, you had a past,
maybe you had a family, a life.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.875
Nice try.

22:54.750 --> 22:57.958
That was good. You two, what a pair!

22:58.041 --> 23:02.500
Gosh! Unbelievable. Wherever you go,
it's just death, destruction,

23:02.583 --> 23:05.041
the literal ends of worlds.

23:05.125 --> 23:08.791
Well, I'm gonna have
to close this case now,

23:08.875 --> 23:10.958
'cause I don't need you anymore.

23:11.041 --> 23:14.125
Yeah, or as you might say,
our interests are no longer aligned.

23:17.041 --> 23:19.583
You know, of all the liars in this place,

23:19.666 --> 23:22.625
and there are a great many,
you're the biggest.

23:22.708 --> 23:25.166
Why? 'Cause I lied about your girlfriend?

23:25.250 --> 23:28.541
Oh, no. That I can respect.
I mean, the lies you tell yourself.

24:10.916 --> 24:12.250
Open the door.

24:15.958 --> 24:18.833
Hello... Oh, I don't know.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.833
Your name's a number.
Can't read it from here.

24:32.083 --> 24:33.416
Come with me.

24:52.041 --> 24:53.666
Mobius?

24:53.750 --> 24:55.291
Oh, yeah.

24:55.750 --> 24:58.000
-You okay?
-Yep, I'm good.

25:03.333 --> 25:05.583
-Case closed.
-Yes.

25:07.458 --> 25:08.750
Cheers.

25:08.833 --> 25:10.708
-Cheers.
-To putting all this behind us.

25:12.833 --> 25:14.125
Amen.

25:16.458 --> 25:20.333
If you could go anywhere, anytime,
where would it be?

25:20.416 --> 25:22.291
I can go anywhere, anytime.

25:22.375 --> 25:23.708
You know what I mean.

25:27.500 --> 25:30.250
Why wouldn't you let me
interrogate Sylvie?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.541
-Sylvie?
-The Variant, that's what Loki calls her.

25:34.625 --> 25:37.500
Why wouldn't you let me,
you know, question her?

25:37.583 --> 25:39.833
I told you,
we couldn't risk her escaping again.

25:39.916 --> 25:41.083
She wouldn't have escaped.

25:41.166 --> 25:44.833
The other Variant got away during
your first interrogation, didn't he?

25:48.333 --> 25:52.166
Come on. Anywhere and anytime
on the timeline. Where'd you go?

25:53.500 --> 25:56.625
I like being here now, with you,
doing the work.

25:57.500 --> 25:58.875
Fine.

26:04.625 --> 26:06.458
I received word from the Time-Keepers.

26:07.041 --> 26:09.875
They want to personally oversee
the Variant's pruning.

26:09.958 --> 26:12.375
And they want you there, too.

26:13.916 --> 26:16.958
It's about time. Great.

26:19.541 --> 26:23.458
When... When did you first notice
what was going on with C-20?

26:25.291 --> 26:27.416
Mobius, what is going on with you?

26:27.500 --> 26:28.500
-Nothing.
-We did it.

26:28.583 --> 26:30.125
-I know.
-The Time-Keepers are happy.

26:30.208 --> 26:31.708
-It's great.
-Mission accomplished.

26:31.791 --> 26:35.791
Mission accomplished.
It was just that she seemed fine when I...

26:35.875 --> 26:38.166
When I saw her.
I mean, a little freaked, but fine.

26:38.250 --> 26:39.916
Well, she quickly wasn't fine.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.625
-Okay.
-Okay.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.666
C-20? The Variant?

26:45.750 --> 26:47.791
All these questions,
what are you getting at?

26:47.875 --> 26:49.875
I don't know. I...

26:50.458 --> 26:52.041
Something just seems a little off.

26:54.916 --> 26:56.500
Fine. You want the truth?

26:59.291 --> 27:00.708
I'm trying to protect you.

27:02.166 --> 27:04.708
Would you normally interview
someone like that? Yeah.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.625
But the Variant scares the hell out of me,

27:06.708 --> 27:09.041
and I didn't want to see
anything happen to you.

27:09.833 --> 27:12.416
C-20 lost her mind.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.333
She couldn't even form words by the end.

27:15.416 --> 27:20.166
I just couldn't deal with that
happening to you or anyone else.

27:21.541 --> 27:23.166
Is that what you wanted to hear?

27:24.625 --> 27:26.333
Yeah, if it's the truth.

27:26.416 --> 27:28.708
You've been spending
too much time with Lokis.

27:28.791 --> 27:30.125
Yeah.

27:30.208 --> 27:32.875
I definitely have been
spending too much time with Lokis.

27:32.958 --> 27:35.041
What we do here matters.

27:35.125 --> 27:36.416
I know.

27:36.500 --> 27:39.833
When we're out there fighting
for the fate of the Sacred Timeline

27:39.916 --> 27:43.041
we're also fighting for this. For us.

27:44.250 --> 27:48.416
Friends against time, allies to the end.

27:49.958 --> 27:53.375
You've seen all of existence, same as me.
So, you know,

27:55.041 --> 27:59.166
friendship like ours is uncommon.

28:02.833 --> 28:04.583
And worth fighting for.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.791
Same as the Sacred Timeline.

28:11.583 --> 28:13.333
It was a good speech.

28:14.291 --> 28:15.375
Thank you.

28:15.458 --> 28:19.333
I knew I was your favorite analyst.
Was that so hard to admit?

28:20.250 --> 28:22.291
What are you gonna do with that trophy?

28:22.375 --> 28:23.791
-Oh!
-Where's that gonna go?

28:23.875 --> 28:25.041
You're right.

28:26.125 --> 28:27.416
Let's see.

28:35.208 --> 28:36.458
RAVONNA: Uh...

28:41.791 --> 28:43.208
How's that?

28:43.291 --> 28:46.166
Looks perfect.
You're running out of room there.

28:47.500 --> 28:50.125
All right, I will see you later on.

28:51.083 --> 28:52.291
One drink?

28:52.833 --> 28:55.041
-MOBIUS: I had two, didn't I?
-Mobius!

28:55.125 --> 28:58.583
This is a career case.
You sure you're okay?

28:59.041 --> 29:02.291
I'm just exhausted,
dealing with all these Lokis.

29:05.875 --> 29:07.291
Fair enough.

29:08.625 --> 29:09.833
Let's finish this.

29:10.333 --> 29:11.875
For all time.

29:11.958 --> 29:13.083
Always.

29:13.166 --> 29:15.833
I'll see you up there.
Thanks for the drink.

29:25.958 --> 29:29.458
Fine. You wanted a fair fight.
I respect that.

29:30.625 --> 29:32.875
When you were in my head, I saw something.

29:34.583 --> 29:36.000
What did you do to me?

29:37.166 --> 29:39.625
I showed you your life before the TVA.

29:39.708 --> 29:41.291
That's a trick. It's a deception.

29:41.375 --> 29:44.166
-No, it's not.
-I was created by the Time-Keepers.

29:44.250 --> 29:47.125
No. I can't create memories.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.166
I can only use what's already there.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.916
The Time-Keepers took your lives from you.

29:55.083 --> 29:56.791
From all of you.

29:57.916 --> 29:58.958
You're Variants.

30:02.166 --> 30:03.541
We're the same.

30:06.541 --> 30:07.958
Show me.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.625
I looked happy.

30:42.333 --> 30:43.666
What now?

31:33.375 --> 31:36.625
You're not hearing me. I was there.

31:36.708 --> 31:40.333
This was real, what I saw.
This is a place that I've been.

31:41.541 --> 31:44.291
This wasn't the TVA. This was a memory.

31:45.416 --> 31:49.041
I lived down there. I went to that bar.
I had friends.

31:49.125 --> 31:51.666
I had a whole life on the Sacred Timeline.

31:51.750 --> 31:54.000
-INTERROGATOR: Calm down.
-"Calm down"? I'm a Variant.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.916
So are you.
So is every single person in this place.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.250
I'm ending this.

32:13.041 --> 32:15.416
I've heard it once,
I've heard it a thousand times.

32:15.500 --> 32:19.875
"You. You conniving, craven,
pathetic worm. You did this."

32:23.375 --> 32:24.375
Right?

32:25.250 --> 32:26.958
-What are you doing?
-Passing the time.

32:27.041 --> 32:28.166
Do you care about her?

32:28.250 --> 32:30.208
Sylvie? I'm not sure
if it's the right word.

32:30.291 --> 32:32.291
-We've covered this back in there.
-Shut up!

32:33.041 --> 32:35.833
Do you really think
you deserve to be alone?

32:35.916 --> 32:37.958
-Loki!
-You told me to shut up.

32:38.041 --> 32:39.750
Do you believe
you deserve to be alone?

32:39.833 --> 32:41.958
-I don't know.
-You better figure it out quick,

32:42.041 --> 32:44.083
because the nexus event
the two of you caused,

32:44.166 --> 32:47.000
whatever that connection is,
can bring this whole place down.

32:47.083 --> 32:48.708
-So we better understand...
-"We"?

32:49.541 --> 32:52.666
Do you swear she didn't implant
those memories in Hunter C-20?

32:52.750 --> 32:54.333
Mobius, no. I believe her.

32:56.291 --> 32:58.791
So, I just have to trust
the word of two Lokis?

33:02.458 --> 33:04.125
How about the word of a friend?

33:07.791 --> 33:11.416
You were right, about the TVA.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.833
You were right from the beginning.

33:13.916 --> 33:16.916
And if you wanna save her,
you need to trust me.

33:17.541 --> 33:18.791
Can we do that?

33:20.250 --> 33:21.250
-Yes.
-MOBIUS: Okay.

33:22.041 --> 33:26.000
You could be whoever,
whatever you wanna be,

33:26.083 --> 33:27.458
even someone good.

33:29.333 --> 33:32.250
I mean, just in case
anyone ever told you different.

33:43.666 --> 33:45.625
I think you have something of mine.

33:46.250 --> 33:51.291
Yeah, I got all the way down there
before I even realized I picked up yours.

33:53.791 --> 33:55.166
What's going on?

33:59.541 --> 34:01.333
What's the problem, Ravonna?

34:08.791 --> 34:10.791
You know where I'd go
if I could go anywhere?

34:12.916 --> 34:14.916
Wherever it is I'm really from.

34:15.458 --> 34:18.375
Yeah, wherever I had a life
before the TVA came along.

34:19.041 --> 34:20.708
Maybe I had a jet ski.

34:21.750 --> 34:23.583
That's what I'd like to do.

34:23.666 --> 34:26.000
-Just riding around on my jet ski.
-Prune him.

34:42.583 --> 34:44.166
Wait for me at the elevator.

35:22.916 --> 35:24.666
Who was in here with her?

35:25.500 --> 35:27.041
Sorry, ma'am, B-15 insisted.

35:32.750 --> 35:35.208
Put out an alert for Hunter B-15.

35:35.291 --> 35:38.041
She too has been compromised
by the Variant.

36:00.250 --> 36:01.500
You okay?

36:06.750 --> 36:08.500
I've got them from here.

36:32.250 --> 36:33.541
Do you remember me?

36:35.125 --> 36:36.375
I do.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.125
What do you wanna say to me, Variant?

36:43.333 --> 36:45.083
What was my nexus event?

36:45.958 --> 36:47.625
Why did you bring me in?

36:48.875 --> 36:50.208
What does it matter?

36:52.458 --> 36:56.208
It was enough to take my life from me,
lead to all of this.

36:57.291 --> 36:59.083
Must have been important.

37:00.083 --> 37:01.166
So, what was it?

37:06.375 --> 37:07.833
I don't remember.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.916
RAVONNA: Gracious Time-Keepers,

37:34.833 --> 37:38.083
as promised, the Variants.

37:39.208 --> 37:41.916
After all your struggle,

37:42.000 --> 37:45.375
at last, you've arrived before us.

37:46.000 --> 37:52.416
What do you have to say for yourselves
before you meet your end, Variants?

37:52.500 --> 37:55.291
Is that the only reason
you brought us here?

37:56.458 --> 37:57.750
To kill us?

37:58.958 --> 38:02.750
I've lost track of the number of times
I've been killed, so go ahead.

38:02.833 --> 38:03.875
Do your worst.

38:04.458 --> 38:10.666
You and your bravado
are no threat to us, Variant.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.708
Oh, no, I don't think you believe that.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.916
-I think...
-

38:18.875 --> 38:20.458
I think you're scared.

38:20.541 --> 38:26.000
No, Variant. You're nothing
but a cosmic disappointment.

38:26.583 --> 38:28.875
-Delete them.
-No, I'm not done with you yet.

38:39.666 --> 38:40.750
For all time.

38:42.041 --> 38:43.166
Always.

38:49.500 --> 38:51.166
Protect the Time-Keepers!

39:01.166 --> 39:02.333
LOKI: A little help here?

39:04.125 --> 39:05.375
Here.

39:07.583 --> 39:08.958
Come on.

39:23.833 --> 39:26.916
This time I finish the job.

39:58.250 --> 40:01.875
You're a child
of the Time-Keepers too, Sylvie.

40:02.541 --> 40:03.708
-We can talk.
-SYLVIE: Oh, yeah?

40:14.541 --> 40:15.625
Wait.

40:24.625 --> 40:25.833
Don't.

40:31.708 --> 40:32.916
Fake.

40:36.041 --> 40:37.625
Mindless androids.

40:43.125 --> 40:44.541
It never stops.

40:49.583 --> 40:53.416
Then who created the TVA?

40:54.375 --> 40:55.750
I thought this was it.

41:12.125 --> 41:13.208
Sylvie...

41:14.958 --> 41:17.083
Not another pep talk, please.

41:17.708 --> 41:21.041
No, I have to tell you something.

41:25.416 --> 41:27.083
We will figure this out.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.041
How do you know that?

41:30.166 --> 41:32.458
Because, uh...

41:33.791 --> 41:35.416
Well, back on Lamentis...

41:39.541 --> 41:42.541
This is new for me. Um...

41:44.208 --> 41:45.333
What?

41:51.166 --> 41:52.166
What is it?

42:10.625 --> 42:11.666
Do it.

42:11.750 --> 42:12.833
No.

42:13.583 --> 42:16.625
You're gonna tell me everything.

42:24.500 --> 42:27.208
If the sun

42:27.291 --> 42:31.208
Should tumble from the sky

42:31.916 --> 42:34.125
If the sea

42:34.416 --> 42:38.791
Should suddenly run dry

42:39.125 --> 42:43.125
If you love me

42:43.208 --> 42:46.166
Really love me

42:46.250 --> 42:48.416
Let it happen

42:49.541 --> 42:53.125
I won't care

42:53.708 --> 42:55.583
If it seems

42:55.958 --> 42:59.375
That everything is lost

43:00.750 --> 43:02.500
I will smile

43:03.166 --> 43:07.541
And never count the cost

43:08.208 --> 43:12.583
If you love me

43:12.666 --> 43:15.666
Really love me

43:15.750 --> 43:18.083
Let it happen

43:18.208 --> 43:22.916
Darling, I

43:23.000 --> 43:26.375
Won't care

43:26.791 --> 43:30.583
Shall I catch a shooting star?

43:30.666 --> 43:34.333
Shall I bring it where you are?

43:34.458 --> 43:38.375
If you want me to, I will

43:41.583 --> 43:45.125
You can set me any task

43:45.208 --> 43:48.833
I'll do anything you ask

43:48.916 --> 43:54.500
If you'll only say you love me still

43:56.625 --> 43:59.041
When at last

43:59.125 --> 44:03.250
Our life on earth is through

44:03.958 --> 44:06.125
I will share

44:06.208 --> 44:10.125
Eternity with you

44:11.208 --> 44:15.333
If you love me

44:15.416 --> 44:18.333
Really love me

44:18.416 --> 44:20.583
Let it happen

44:21.750 --> 44:25.750
I won't care

44:25.875 --> 44:30.500
I you love me

44:30.583 --> 44:33.208
Really love me

44:33.291 --> 44:35.625
Let it happen

44:36.125 --> 44:39.791
Darling, I...

44:50.000 --> 44:51.583
Is this Hel?

44:53.875 --> 44:55.125
Am I dead?

44:55.791 --> 44:56.958
VOICE: Not yet.

45:00.625 --> 45:02.625
But you will be unless you come with us.
