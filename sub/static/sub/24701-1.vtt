WEBVTT

00:08.842 --> 00:10.051
Look at him.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.596
Look at that smug look on his smug face.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.224
He thinks the presidency
is his birthright,

00:16.306 --> 00:18.309
like he's the heir to the throne.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.854
I don't care who your mother is.

00:20.937 --> 00:23.648
You just want to ruin my chances
of getting into Harvard, don't you?

00:24.232 --> 00:25.710
Like when you brought in the governor

00:25.734 --> 00:28.361
to upstage
my kindergarten graduation speech.

00:28.945 --> 00:31.906
But I'm not gonna let you get in my way,
not this time.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.493
God, do I detest you.

00:36.244 --> 00:39.622
I loathe you, Bennett Russell.
I despise you, Bennett Russell.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.586
- I abhor you...
- Isn't that right, Lona?

00:42.167 --> 00:43.001
I'm sorry?

00:43.084 --> 00:46.421
Isn't your president
usually decided by a vote?

00:46.504 --> 00:49.591
Yes, but since we have an even number
of members, we cannot have a vote.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.843
- Well, how many members do you have?
- Two.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.637
- Uh, she and I.
- Her and I.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.599
- Her and myself.
- Him and me, myself and I. We, two!

00:57.682 --> 00:58.826
- I got it.
- He gets it.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.494
Therefore,
seniority should take precedent.

01:00.518 --> 01:03.563
- I'm a month older than she is.
- No, seniority, not age.

01:03.646 --> 01:06.083
I've participated and placed
in more total events than he has,

01:06.107 --> 01:07.025
including the state tournament.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.569
I've also raised more money
than she has for our program,

01:09.652 --> 01:11.738
and for our school
and for that lovely building...

01:11.821 --> 01:14.341
You don't get to buy your way
to the top with your mother's Rolodex.

01:14.365 --> 01:17.452
Isn't this ultimately
Mr. Johnson's responsibility?

01:17.535 --> 01:18.535
Absolutely.

01:18.578 --> 01:21.664
But he said that if he made the decision,
it would cause tension in our club.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.209
- Principal Nelson, this is our...
- Co-presidents!

01:24.292 --> 01:25.292
Co what?

01:25.794 --> 01:27.587
Co-presidents!

01:27.670 --> 01:29.464
Therefore, unlike years past,

01:29.547 --> 01:31.716
the two of you will finally learn
how to work together.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.844
No! Co-presidents goes against the purpose
of even having a president.

01:34.928 --> 01:35.970
Fine. No president.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.054
No president?

01:37.096 --> 01:40.475
No president, co-president,
I don't give a damn.

01:40.558 --> 01:43.394
A year from now,
I'm gonna be in the south of France,

01:43.478 --> 01:48.274
sipping something strong,
sweet and expensive, capiche?

01:48.358 --> 01:49.234
No capiche.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.986
Lona, I don't have the energy,
I don't have the time.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.923
Frankly, I've already forgotten
what club you're here...

01:53.947 --> 01:55.281
- Debate!
- Debate!

01:55.365 --> 01:57.158
Go. Out. Scram.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.243
Shoo!

01:58.326 --> 01:59.494
Go talk to Kathy.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:41.429 --> 03:43.699
Principal Nelson knows
how much we hate each other.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.368
- What is he trying to accomplish?
- Maybe it'll teach you a lesson.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.435
What lesson?

03:48.144 --> 03:50.939
I don't know. Just sounded like
the kind of thing I should say.

03:51.022 --> 03:54.651
Kathy, this is a vehement hatred.
There's nothing that we agree on.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.111
- You both don't like the arrangement.
- Besides that.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.405
- And you both hate each other...
- You're not helping.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.200
You are now one of the presidents.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.619
Put that in your little Harvard
application and move on.

04:04.702 --> 04:07.205
- To what?
- To whatever your heart desires.

04:07.288 --> 04:10.291
Kathy, my heart is a muscular organ
that pumps blood through my body,

04:10.375 --> 04:12.645
and, although romanticized,
has no bearing on my love life

04:12.669 --> 04:14.629
- or my moral decision-making.
- All right.

04:14.712 --> 04:16.505
Let me rephrase.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.507
You ask anybody to Homecoming yet?

04:19.509 --> 04:20.343
No.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.303
I'm not a social person.

04:22.387 --> 04:26.266
So what? You think I waited around
for some guy to ask me out?

04:26.349 --> 04:28.977
No, sir.
I got things done on my own terms.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.770
And look at me, I did great.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.022
Sorry.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.234
My greatest skill is arguing with people.
That's not date material.

04:36.317 --> 04:39.195
If you show up at that dance
wearing a tux,

04:39.279 --> 04:43.616
you're gonna be approached by more ladies
than that guy on that sexist TV show,

04:43.700 --> 04:44.885
I can never remember the name.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.911
What's it called,
the one with the bachelor?

04:46.995 --> 04:48.913
- The Bachelor.
- That's the one.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.082
I mean, but why have a relationship
in high school?

04:51.165 --> 04:53.936
You wind up at different colleges,
and then it was all a waste of time.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.921
Why do you guys take Calculus
when you're not gonna become engineers?

04:57.005 --> 04:58.881
Because Calculus teaches you to...

05:01.968 --> 05:03.570
Whatever it teaches you,
it doesn't matter.

05:03.594 --> 05:04.721
It gives you tools, right?

05:04.804 --> 05:07.432
So your argument
is that I'll become a better kisser?

05:07.515 --> 05:09.600
No! My argument...

05:09.684 --> 05:12.103
Well, yes. Wait, yes!

05:12.687 --> 05:15.606
I was gonna talk about lasting
relationships, but kissing is better.

05:15.690 --> 05:18.693
Forget Yale.
Focus on becoming a better kisser.

05:18.776 --> 05:21.738
- Are you writing this down?
- You want me to write it?

05:21.821 --> 05:23.239
The world needs good men

05:23.323 --> 05:24.824
who know how to kiss.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.659
I'm dead serious.
Are you writing this down?

05:26.743 --> 05:27.845
- No!
- Well, you should,

05:27.869 --> 05:29.763
because Research Connection
is the gold standard!

05:29.787 --> 05:31.907
You can't even do
a date-specific search on that site,

05:31.956 --> 05:34.018
- and it's a hundred dollars more...
- It's $50 more.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.669
Yeah, easy for you to say
when you wipe your ass with $50 bills.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.356
But for those of us who don't have
the opportunity to have that luxury...

05:39.380 --> 05:40.380
Stop!

05:41.549 --> 05:43.176
Not my tempo.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.638
"Not my tempo."
Come on, from Whiplash.

05:47.722 --> 05:51.142
Really? Nobody saw it? JK Simmons.
He won an Academy Award.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.685
Mr. Johnson, as I was saying...

05:52.769 --> 05:54.496
The extra 50 bucks
is within our budget, Lona.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.665
And furthermore,
there's no reason you should ever mention

05:56.689 --> 06:00.151
your fellow student's estimated wealth
and whether they can or cannot afford

06:00.234 --> 06:02.737
to wipe their butts
with any type of currency.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.489
Mr. Johnson, it's a terrible site.

06:04.572 --> 06:07.134
We only get to buy a subscription
to one research database per year,

06:07.158 --> 06:09.202
and it should be East Law.
It's ranked number one.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.746
- By you and your mom?
- By U.S. News Report.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.509
And besides,
we have to conserve our funds,

06:13.581 --> 06:15.976
so that Taylor and Tucker
have the resources they need to learn.

06:16.000 --> 06:16.834
Who?

06:16.918 --> 06:19.587
Taylor and Tanner
joined our club this afternoon.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.799
And they deserve to have an opinion.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.802
Democracy is democracy.
It doesn't matter if they're uneducated.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.696
- New. She means new.
- Same difference.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.638
She means new.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.973
We don't even know
what a research database is.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.558
You both are going to do great.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.120
Now, first of all,
this team needed some new faces,

06:35.144 --> 06:36.896
and apparently a new attitude.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.357
Second of all,
if we're gonna get anywhere this year,

06:39.440 --> 06:42.318
you two have gotta agree
on something, anything,

06:42.401 --> 06:44.779
or I swear
I'm gonna make the twins co-presidents.

06:46.572 --> 06:50.576
Bennett said he raised money?
Am I to assume he went door to door?

06:50.660 --> 06:54.205
'Cause his mother's an ATM with lipstick
who releases 50s every time she farts.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.082
She's a very popular senator.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.583
Please.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.336
Julia's a state senator.

07:00.503 --> 07:03.172
And to me, she's still the teenage robot
who lived in the library.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.507
Hey! I live in the library.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.801
- Yeah, you're different.
- Different how?

07:07.468 --> 07:08.594
You're just different.

07:09.178 --> 07:11.472
Listen, tomorrow you're gonna win
another trophy

07:11.556 --> 07:13.975
and the Harvard application
isn't due for another week...

07:14.058 --> 07:15.058
Four days.

07:16.185 --> 07:17.520
Shit! Four days?

07:19.021 --> 07:20.440
Okay, well, did you write it in?

07:20.523 --> 07:23.067
Yes. Lona Skinner, co-president...

07:23.151 --> 07:25.236
...of the Hemlock Prep Academy
Debate Club.

07:25.319 --> 07:27.572
You should be proud of that.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.489
What?

07:28.573 --> 07:33.327
You earned it, and you are qualified,
and you are my son.

07:37.039 --> 07:38.416
One second, baby.

07:38.499 --> 07:39.499
Julia Russell.

07:40.960 --> 07:45.756
Listen, I was in D.C. last week.
I'm going to D.C. next week,

07:45.840 --> 07:51.137
so you tell those wrinkled old bags
that I am not coming to D.C. this week,

07:51.220 --> 07:54.765
and if they lose their shit
I will buy each of them a diaper.

08:00.229 --> 08:04.525
As a first-generation college student,
I know the importance of higher education,

08:04.609 --> 08:08.279
which is why I started this foundation
that hands out scholarships.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.781
I'm hanging up on you now.

08:10.865 --> 08:11.908
Sorry, baby.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.452
No, it's just that
being co-presidents is ridiculous,

08:14.535 --> 08:16.454
- because Lona is impossible to work with.
- Oh!

08:16.537 --> 08:18.372
Forget about her and her mother.

08:18.456 --> 08:22.084
You just need to focus
on that good-looking dude in the mirror

08:22.168 --> 08:24.629
that's getting into Yale. Am I right?

08:24.712 --> 08:28.257
Right? Next month,
you'll qualify for the state tournament

08:28.341 --> 08:31.511
and Harvard will give you a full ride,
just like Hemlock did.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.886
Because we're poor.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.515
No. Because you're smart.

08:37.099 --> 08:39.018
And you're a hard worker.

08:39.101 --> 08:41.229
And you're a kick-ass debater.

08:43.105 --> 08:44.899
And because we're poor.

08:44.982 --> 08:47.109
I'm just glad it'll all be over soon.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.987
I'll be at Harvard and Bennett
will be at Yale, and that will be that.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.114
You're right.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.394
Good luck today, sweetie.

09:22.937 --> 09:25.439
Oh, my God. It's not about luck, Mom.
We've been through this.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.543
This isn't a sport, where the ball drifts
in and out of play

09:27.567 --> 09:28.585
depending upon the weather.

09:28.609 --> 09:32.029
This is a skilled event based on research,
memorization and execution,

09:32.113 --> 09:33.739
where I am in charge of my own destiny.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.117
- It's not about luck.
- Obviously.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.870
I'm gonna go jump in the coffee
and make some shower.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.601
Ladies and gentlemen, debaters and guests

09:44.625 --> 09:47.086
welcome to the 51st Montague Classic.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.672
The first round will be starting
in approximately ten minutes.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.424
- Amy!
- Senator.

09:51.507 --> 09:53.426
Senator? Please! Come on.

09:53.509 --> 09:55.928
You know it's Julia. How are you?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.221
I'm really well.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.181
My daughter is the co-president

09:59.265 --> 10:01.267
of the Hemlock Prep Academy
Debate Club, so...

10:01.350 --> 10:03.894
How silly was that?
Co-presidents?

10:03.978 --> 10:06.355
Well, I'm just glad
it all worked out in the end.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.066
Actually, I don't think it worked out.
I think Lona deserved it.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.528
And that's what makes you
such a great mom.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.423
We should all feel that way
about our kids, right?

10:14.447 --> 10:16.616
No, I think the fact
that she's the school's

10:16.699 --> 10:19.869
only three-time state qualifier
makes her the best choice.

10:19.952 --> 10:23.497
Well, sometimes we just gotta let
the system work, don't we?

10:24.582 --> 10:28.085
It's good to see you, uh, Amy.
Good luck to your daughter.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.464
It's not about luck, Julia.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.064
Hello, I'm Bennett.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.524
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.259
All right, it's time. My name is Zach.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.987
I'm gonna be your judge
for today's debate.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.513
As previously assigned,

11:20.596 --> 11:22.765
Hemlock Prep is gonna be arguing
for the affirmative

11:22.848 --> 11:24.475
and Western for the negative.

11:24.558 --> 11:25.976
- Any questions?
- How's Princeton?

11:26.560 --> 11:28.521
It's going great. Thanks, Lona.

11:28.604 --> 11:29.438
How are you?

11:29.522 --> 11:31.941
I'm just glad you're judging
and not sitting over there.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.318
All right, you're up.

11:34.402 --> 11:35.903
Is anyone not ready?

11:35.986 --> 11:38.866
I affirm the costs of a college education
are outweighed by the benefits.

11:51.210 --> 11:55.297
As of 2011, student loan debt and credit
card debt topped one trillion dollars...

12:01.387 --> 12:04.306
In the evidence previously mentioned,
the numbers suggest that we...

12:08.894 --> 12:10.604
That is why you must vote aff.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.275
Is anyone not ready?

12:15.651 --> 12:18.371
I negate that the costs of
a college education outweigh the benefits.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.640
...has effectively become the threshold

12:28.664 --> 12:30.064
for middle class and family income.

12:30.124 --> 12:33.127
In 1970 almost 60%
of high school graduates, um,

12:33.210 --> 12:35.170
were in middle school
but that number plummeted...

12:37.631 --> 12:38.966
That's why you must vote neg.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.350
I'm voting with the affirmative,
Hemlock Prep.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.516
Is anyone not ready?

12:49.143 --> 12:52.271
I negate the costs of a college education
outweigh the benefits.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.171
One: during times of economic depression
college educations are vital.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.835
Given the uncertain nature of the economy

13:00.863 --> 13:03.063
a college education can function
as an insurance policy.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.010
First, the demand for college degrees
is rising.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.234
Getting a college education
is more important than ever.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.931
...significant amount of gains associated
with higher lifetime earnings.

13:09.955 --> 13:13.035
If people have more money in their pockets
they're able to spend that money...

13:15.503 --> 13:17.689
The labor report we provided predicts
job openings will soon increase

13:17.713 --> 13:19.840
as the Baby Boomer generation
continues to retire.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.693
Therefore, we should encourage
college graduation

13:21.717 --> 13:23.236
to ensure people have enough
disposable income

13:23.260 --> 13:24.779
to contribute to national
and global economies.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.531
A college education remains
the best option...

13:26.555 --> 13:27.949
And that is why you must vote neg.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.269
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the awards ceremony

13:32.353 --> 13:34.563
of the 51st Annual Classic.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.775
These are some of the biggest statuettes
I've ever seen.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.194
And we did that on purpose.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.404
Okay, I have a stupid question.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.782
- There are no stupid questions.
- Just stupid people.

13:44.865 --> 13:47.493
Uninformed. She means uninformed.
What's your question?

13:47.576 --> 13:48.970
Why do you talk so fast when you debate?

13:48.994 --> 13:51.806
A few years back, they changed the rules
so we only have eight minutes per round.

13:51.830 --> 13:54.226
And then everyone started speaking faster
to get more points.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.167
The more arguments you make,

13:55.251 --> 13:57.331
the more arguments your opponents
have to respond to.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.855
But you can't understand
what you're saying.

13:58.879 --> 13:59.880
- You can't.
- You can?

13:59.964 --> 14:00.964
Nobody can.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.568
Everyone emails judges and opponents
everything right before the debate.

14:03.592 --> 14:04.426
So everyone's reading.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.387
And that's a good tip for all of you.

14:06.470 --> 14:10.182
When you're debating, don't get bored
by the sound of your own voice.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.893
Be bored by the other person's voice.

14:12.977 --> 14:13.811
Are you guys done?

14:13.894 --> 14:15.580
Shouldn't there be one more round
of debates?

14:15.604 --> 14:17.290
- What about the finals?
- That's a great question.

14:17.314 --> 14:19.292
But the last two standing
are from the same school.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.627
You can't debate against your own school.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.712
- Stupid rule.
- So what happens then?

14:22.736 --> 14:27.116
Co-champions, ladies and gentlemen,
from Hemlock Prep Academy,

14:27.199 --> 14:29.326
Lona Skinner and Bennett Russell!

14:36.876 --> 14:38.878
- Lona, congratulations.
- Thank you.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.648
- Bennett, congratulations.
- Thank you.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.923
Are you sure we filled out
the financial part correctly?

15:24.006 --> 15:26.216
Well, you're going to community college
if we didn't.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.676
Mom!

15:27.760 --> 15:30.429
It's fine. I took it to an H&R Block guy.

15:30.512 --> 15:33.265
And that guy says you're getting in.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.642
And he went to Brown University,

15:34.725 --> 15:38.604
which I think
is also an Ivy League school.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.606
No?

15:42.691 --> 15:45.444
It is. Brown University! Right?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.044
It's good, Lona. It really is.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.797
- I only have one question.
- What?

16:04.880 --> 16:06.465
Is it all true?

16:06.548 --> 16:11.136
I mean, in my day if I mowed one lawn,
I put down "landscape architect."

16:11.220 --> 16:15.099
I saw one black and white movie,
the thing said "cinematic historian."

16:15.182 --> 16:16.892
It's okay. You can tell me.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.060
It's all true.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.853
Right answer.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.188
Is anything missing?

16:22.523 --> 16:23.691
Honestly, yes.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.859
- One thing.
- What?

16:25.943 --> 16:26.943
What?

16:27.820 --> 16:29.655
My lucky stamp.

16:29.738 --> 16:33.826
Your application
is now guidance counselor-certified

16:33.909 --> 16:36.161
and gets my stamp of approval.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.162
It's a tradition.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.998
What's the success rate of your students?

16:39.081 --> 16:42.501
One hundred percent of my students
end up at the institution

16:42.584 --> 16:43.836
where they're meant to be.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.838
Oh, God.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.589
Oh, what are you worried about?

16:47.673 --> 16:50.968
Who did your mom get to write you a letter
of recommendation to get into Yale?

16:51.552 --> 16:53.655
- Someone who went to Harvard.
- Just someone who went to Harvard.

16:53.679 --> 16:54.555
Barack Obama.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.974
- Barack Obama.
- He's a family friend.

16:57.057 --> 16:59.059
Family friend, Barack Obama.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.620
He also used to be
President of the United States.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.688
Yeah, I know. I voted for him.

17:02.771 --> 17:04.356
And I went to school with him.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.691
And I dated his brother-in-law.

17:05.773 --> 17:08.444
That's two truths and a lie.
You pick the lie.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.488
- So you'll mail it out for me?
- Oh, no, no.

17:11.571 --> 17:13.824
You have to take this down
to the school mailbox

17:13.906 --> 17:14.742
and mail it yourself.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.410
Because when you're my age,

17:16.492 --> 17:19.997
all your high school memories
blend in together.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.999
Except for a very few moments.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.460
And 50 bucks says this is one of them.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.178
Don't worry.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.557
- Take your time.
- Of course.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.894
It's just, you know, Harvard.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.896
That's a very good school.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.732
I'm sure you'll be very competitive.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.568
I'm going to Yale.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.987
- Oh, that's a good one, too.
- Thank you.

18:11.924 --> 18:12.924
Thank you.

18:13.383 --> 18:14.383
All right.

18:39.535 --> 18:40.535
What are you doing?

18:41.161 --> 18:43.956
- What does it look like?
- Yeah, but you need to be getting ready.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.767
I have plenty of time.
This is more important.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.585
I have the regional qualifier
for the state tournament tomorrow.

18:48.669 --> 18:52.256
It's your senior year.
One dance will not kill you.

18:52.339 --> 18:53.757
It might.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.926
It's Homecoming. You're going.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.304
- You're meeting up at a friend's house?
- Yes, I have friends, Mom.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.508
Then you'll all go together?

19:01.056 --> 19:03.725
Mom, you won, okay?
I'm going to Homecoming.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.519
You don't have to know every detail.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.649
- Pick one. I'll return the rest.
- No, those are not my style.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.442
And what is your style?

19:12.526 --> 19:13.819
What's wrong with this?

19:15.070 --> 19:17.406
You're not going to homecoming
dressed like an accountant.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.575
I thought you said
I was pulling off Diane Keaton.

19:20.617 --> 19:21.617
Did I?

19:22.411 --> 19:25.414
Sweetie, you're a teenager.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.542
Would it kill you to dress
like Taylor Swift for one night?

19:29.418 --> 19:33.088
Here. Try this on. If it fits, it's yours.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.591
Please?

19:46.810 --> 19:48.228
Sweet Jesus.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.023
You don't think it's too revealing?

19:51.106 --> 19:52.566
You gotta give 'em a little taste.

19:52.649 --> 19:53.649
Mom!

19:54.109 --> 19:55.027
You look beautiful.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.070
You look elegant.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.154
Is that better?

19:59.198 --> 20:02.659
It's expensive and the money should be
going to my college fund...

20:02.743 --> 20:04.286
Going to this.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.039
I would take seven side jobs if I had to.

20:07.122 --> 20:10.417
You've been the cheapest teenage daughter
a mother could have.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.711
No jewelry.

20:12.794 --> 20:15.380
No makeup. No pregnancies.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.716
No jail time that I know of.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.719
Honestly, I can't believe you're my kid.

20:22.095 --> 20:23.388
I want this for you.

20:24.556 --> 20:25.891
I want this for me.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.145
You know, this is one of those

20:30.229 --> 20:32.606
mother-daughter special moments,
don't you?

20:32.689 --> 20:35.442
What, my inability to breathe?

20:35.525 --> 20:39.196
Well, I think the goal is to get out
of the dress as quickly as possible.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.572
I'm kidding.

21:09.977 --> 21:12.396
♪ A bird without a swing

22:28.597 --> 22:29.431
Oh!

22:29.514 --> 22:31.683
- Watch where you're...
- Sorry.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.109
Uh... Theater Two?

22:42.360 --> 22:43.360
Huh.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.958
Shoot.

23:49.219 --> 23:50.219
Um...

23:51.847 --> 23:54.266
I'm just glad I'm not the only one
who still gets dressed up

23:54.349 --> 23:55.475
to go to the movies.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.270
I don't want to talk about it.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.189
Um...

24:01.273 --> 24:02.440
Do you want a ride?

24:07.529 --> 24:08.989
I can walk.

24:09.072 --> 24:10.072
Lona, it's...

24:10.490 --> 24:11.741
It's cold outside.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.913
That's a keen observation.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.249
Well, we got the regional qualifier
tomorrow, so...

24:19.332 --> 24:20.332
Is it tomorrow?

24:20.834 --> 24:22.961
God, I better start preparing. Hmm.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.807
You'll take me straight home?

24:38.977 --> 24:43.064
Let me get a number four
with a large fry and a vanilla shake.

24:43.857 --> 24:44.691
Do you want something?

24:44.774 --> 24:46.651
You were supposed
to take me straight home.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.570
I don't even understand why we're here.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.740
- She'll have a chocolate shake.
- I'm not drinking that.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.575
I saw a documentary
about places like this

24:53.658 --> 24:55.911
called Fast and Furious:
On Your Intestines.

24:55.994 --> 24:58.580
Sure, it goes down easy.
But you'll be curled over...

25:10.425 --> 25:12.105
They said it was supposed to rain tonight.

25:13.970 --> 25:14.970
It might.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.183
Why are you even eating here? Hmm?

25:18.266 --> 25:19.935
Is your personal chef on holiday?

25:20.018 --> 25:21.561
He's vacationing in Belize.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.023
I don't have a chef.

25:25.774 --> 25:28.151
Well, you should,
because this crap will kill you.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.529
I don't know how anyone could make
the conscious decision to eat here.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.615
I'm not drinking it.

25:35.575 --> 25:36.785
Right? Yeah?

25:36.868 --> 25:39.663
This time, dip a fry inside.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.874
That's disgusting.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.751
Everything's better with fries.

25:44.834 --> 25:48.004
I mean, sweet and salty perfection.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.088
Here.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.173
Try it.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.941
No, thank you.

26:08.024 --> 26:09.067
It's just a jacket.

26:34.592 --> 26:35.802
Thanks for the shake.

26:42.684 --> 26:44.352
Don't be late tomorrow.

26:57.699 --> 26:59.743
Hi, Bennett. It's your mother.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.536
I know you're inside,

27:01.745 --> 27:04.622
but I know today is also the day
for the qualifiers,

27:04.706 --> 27:06.624
so I wanted to wish you luck

27:06.708 --> 27:09.794
because I know you are going to qualify
and be at that state tournament.

27:09.878 --> 27:14.007
I also wanted to let you know
that in anticipation of that excitement,

27:14.090 --> 27:17.427
I reserved us two rooms at that hotel,
the one with the waterfall.

27:17.510 --> 27:18.636
I can't wait.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.306
Anyway, have a great day, honey.
Oh! And before I forget,

27:21.389 --> 27:25.727
I laid on your bed that outfit
that I think is just so damn charming.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.771
I'm so excited. I love you!

27:30.357 --> 27:33.943
So do you like arguing the con side
or the pro side?

27:34.027 --> 27:37.197
It's called "aff" for affirmative
and "neg" for negative.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.199
That's what I meant, aff or neg.

27:39.282 --> 27:42.160
- It doesn't matter.
- No, I know, but...

27:42.243 --> 27:44.621
That's why we have
the same debate topic all year long,

27:44.704 --> 27:47.290
so that we get to know
both sides intimately.

27:47.374 --> 27:50.085
But which one are you hoping
that you get to argue?

27:50.168 --> 27:53.380
That sort of thinking
is a loser's mentality.

27:53.463 --> 27:57.634
Totally. It was a test. Oh, shit!
I left my phone in the car.

27:57.717 --> 27:58.917
- I'll meet you inside.
- Okay.

28:12.774 --> 28:15.443
- Oh! Hi, Amy.
- Julia.

28:16.653 --> 28:17.779
Baby, I'll see you inside.

28:21.699 --> 28:24.244
Bennett tells me
Lona's applied to Harvard.

28:24.327 --> 28:25.161
That's right.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.580
That is incredible.

28:27.664 --> 28:30.504
You gotta dream big, you know.
You can't listen to what the critics say.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.044
If you want to do something, you do it.

28:34.462 --> 28:36.148
- Bennett's applying to Yale?
- Yeah.

28:36.172 --> 28:38.317
I mean, obviously,
I would've been happy if he went anywhere

28:38.341 --> 28:40.009
but he just fell in love with it, so...

28:41.136 --> 28:42.512
Like mother, like son.

28:42.595 --> 28:43.595
Right.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.520
Oh, did you want to get something
from your car?

28:51.855 --> 28:52.855
Oh!

28:53.273 --> 28:55.751
I was going to grab something
but then we started talking, so...

28:55.775 --> 28:57.652
You can get it
and then we can go in together.

28:57.736 --> 28:58.736
No, it's no big deal.

29:01.030 --> 29:03.742
I'm sorry? It's no big deal
and you don't need anything,

29:03.825 --> 29:06.286
or it's no big deal
and you don't want me to wait?

29:06.369 --> 29:08.889
I would have to look for it
and you would just be standing there

29:08.955 --> 29:11.583
and I didn't want it to be awkward, so...

29:16.129 --> 29:17.130
I'll see you inside, Amy.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.033
What was that back there?

29:45.116 --> 29:46.796
Everyone found out their first assignment.

29:46.868 --> 29:48.620
Who they're debating, what time and where.

29:48.703 --> 29:49.954
- Even you two?
- Yep.

29:50.038 --> 29:52.791
- Why didn't you look at your phones?
- It's a sign of weakness.

29:52.874 --> 29:54.626
So you guys think you're gonna win again?

29:56.544 --> 29:58.463
At a regional qualifier,
there's no winner.

29:58.546 --> 30:01.257
The top four contestants will move on
to the state tournament.

30:01.341 --> 30:03.319
The costs of a college education
are outweighed by the benefits.

30:03.343 --> 30:06.030
A college education is a strong, positive
predictor of economic mobility...

30:06.054 --> 30:08.254
Consider why the costs of a college
education are way...

30:10.850 --> 30:13.853
People don't learn anything
substantial in college...

30:15.480 --> 30:18.775
In 1970, almost 60 percent
of high school graduates...

30:20.026 --> 30:22.838
The fact that such a high number
of students need to be re-taught skills

30:22.862 --> 30:24.590
learned in high school
prior to commencing collegiate study

30:24.614 --> 30:27.334
demonstrates people are ending up
in college who should not be there.

30:41.881 --> 30:43.550
Is anyone not ready?

30:43.883 --> 30:46.529
I affirm the costs of a college
education are outweighed by the benefits.

30:46.553 --> 30:49.180
It's always important
to scout potential opponents.

30:49.264 --> 30:50.825
But you don't have any more debates today.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.809
We're scouting opponents
for the state tournament.

30:58.398 --> 30:59.858
This is his opening statement

30:59.941 --> 31:02.402
- which is why he's being so...
- Cute?

31:02.485 --> 31:05.530
Well, I was gonna say vague, but sure.

31:05.613 --> 31:07.991
We do that here
and that is why you must vote aff.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.001
Is anybody not ready?

31:20.670 --> 31:23.965
Whether or not college is worth
the price of admissions

31:24.048 --> 31:26.009
is not the debate
we should be having today.

31:27.635 --> 31:29.137
Let me tell you a story.

31:29.721 --> 31:33.766
Both of my parents have to work two jobs
to provide for my family.

31:33.850 --> 31:36.311
And they don't have the luxury of funding

31:36.394 --> 31:39.480
the test prep courses,
essay coaches and tutors

31:39.564 --> 31:42.233
that many of my peers have access to
in order to get a leg up...

31:42.317 --> 31:44.545
- Why is she talking so slow?
- Shh!

31:44.569 --> 31:46.321
Pay attention.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.364
...the admissions process is desirable.

31:48.448 --> 31:51.576
Better yet, appropriate,
or even necessary,

31:51.659 --> 31:56.164
given the significant social
and financial pressures that it places

31:56.247 --> 31:59.208
on individual students and their families,

31:59.292 --> 32:02.754
especially those
from low-income households

32:02.837 --> 32:05.149
- like the one I grew up in.
- Is debating like this even allowed?

32:05.173 --> 32:08.676
The rules state you're supposed to offer
evidence to argue aff or neg.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.971
But the evidence you use
is, well, debatable.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.264
I don't get it.

32:13.348 --> 32:16.017
Okay, if I was going to argue
water is wet,

32:16.100 --> 32:19.020
my evidence would be scientific data
that proves on Planet Earth,

32:19.103 --> 32:23.441
throughout history, time and time again,
water has always been proven wet.

32:23.524 --> 32:25.544
- And I would cite my references.
- Because those are facts.

32:25.568 --> 32:29.030
And it's way more convincing
than if my evidence was water is wet

32:29.113 --> 32:30.365
because I touched it once.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.950
Because you can't touch the evidence.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.786
- No. Because it's anecdotal.
- It's what?

32:35.495 --> 32:38.456
It's what Jasmine was doing
and what she does every debate.

32:38.539 --> 32:40.875
She talks about her personal experiences,
anecdotes.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.335
And she can do that?

32:42.418 --> 32:44.837
Sure, she can do it but it's risky.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.465
Her slow pace keeps her from being able
to make as many points.

32:47.548 --> 32:49.485
Therefore, in order for her
to win a competition...

32:49.509 --> 32:50.551
Which she never has.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.988
...Jasmine would have to show
that her own personal experiences

32:53.012 --> 32:55.223
are, for some reason,
more important than facts.

32:55.306 --> 32:58.851
Always stick to the facts.
Jasmine's fighting a losing battle.

32:58.935 --> 33:00.561
Maybe she doesn't care if she wins.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.125
In just a moment, I'll be announcing

33:05.149 --> 33:07.110
the names of our four finalists

33:07.193 --> 33:10.113
who will go on to compete
for our state tournament this year.

33:10.196 --> 33:13.074
But first,
we have a special guest speaker.

33:13.157 --> 33:14.409
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:14.492 --> 33:19.414
a few words from a debate mom
and our state senator, Julia Russell.

33:25.461 --> 33:26.461
Thank you.

33:26.504 --> 33:30.675
I know you've been debating the pros
and cons of higher education all day,

33:30.758 --> 33:31.926
and so I will be brief,

33:32.010 --> 33:35.096
since I don't want to steal the spotlight
from the kids.

33:35.179 --> 33:37.682
Yet she's literally stealing
the spotlight from the kids.

33:37.765 --> 33:41.936
The Yale Alumni Association helped me
get my first job practicing law.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.522
And so I started this foundation

33:44.605 --> 33:48.151
so that I might be able to help others
with their start.

33:48.234 --> 33:52.238
And today, our donors
include Oprah Winfrey...

33:52.321 --> 33:55.950
...Bono, Mark Zuckerberg.

33:56.034 --> 34:01.330
And everyone who gets involved
always says the same thing.

34:01.414 --> 34:03.958
Stop dropping so many names?

34:04.042 --> 34:08.045
They say that their success
started with a work ethic

34:08.129 --> 34:10.505
that began when they were your age.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.967
The costs of listening to this woman
outweigh the benefits.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.387
- As you become more involved...
- Mom, stop it.

34:16.471 --> 34:19.849
Sorry, it seems like there is
a distraction somewhere in the audience,

34:19.931 --> 34:22.893
which probably means
I'm taking up too much time.

34:23.770 --> 34:26.230
My apologies, Senator.
I should've raised my hand.

34:26.313 --> 34:27.190
My God.

34:27.273 --> 34:31.360
I was just curious if you could give us
your definition of success.

34:32.779 --> 34:33.779
That's a great question.

34:33.821 --> 34:36.991
But, unfortunately, this is not a Q and A.

34:37.074 --> 34:40.953
It's just the people you just listed
are all multi-billionaires.

34:41.036 --> 34:45.625
So are you saying that type of wealth
is the best way to measure success?

34:48.835 --> 34:50.295
Full disclosure, everyone,

34:50.379 --> 34:53.257
Amy Skinner and I
are old high school friends,

34:53.341 --> 34:57.094
and so we like to jest with one another
from time to time.

34:57.678 --> 34:59.097
Isn't that right, Amy?

34:59.180 --> 35:01.140
I'm just asking about success.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.392
Oh! And I have a great idea.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.186
Why don't you come up here

35:05.269 --> 35:08.231
and share with everyone
your success story?

35:08.314 --> 35:10.775
I'm sure that these students
would love to hear all about it.

35:10.858 --> 35:15.321
I mean, forgive me, I'm not entirely clear
on all the details myself, so...

35:15.404 --> 35:19.200
No, thanks. I wouldn't want to steal
the spotlight from the kids.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.181
They were the reason we didn't qualify.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.626
After Amy and Julia went at it,
the judges stopped the awards ceremony

35:28.709 --> 35:31.838
and took five minutes to talk
before they announced the qualifiers.

35:31.921 --> 35:33.089
It's not fair.

35:33.172 --> 35:36.092
Have you ever considered the possibility
that sometimes you lose?

35:36.175 --> 35:39.762
The same thing happened
in middle school. Twice.

35:39.846 --> 35:41.430
Or sometimes you lose.

35:41.514 --> 35:42.723
Not often.

35:42.807 --> 35:45.101
Mr. Johnson said you have another shot
next month.

35:45.184 --> 35:46.769
That's just for teams.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.896
- And?
- And I don't have a partner.

35:48.980 --> 35:49.980
Go with Lona.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.441
You're high on chocolate right now.

35:52.525 --> 35:55.111
When I come to work high,
you'll know it.

35:55.194 --> 35:56.571
Ask Debbie in Accounting.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.197
We'd kill each other.

35:58.281 --> 36:01.075
No. There is no possible way
that I'm gonna debate alongside the guy

36:01.159 --> 36:03.679
who in the seventh grade
ripped pages out of my biology textbook

36:03.703 --> 36:04.847
so I couldn't do my homework.

36:04.871 --> 36:08.207
It's a fact that he is a dick to everyone
every day all the time.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.501
That's a line we don't cross.
The dick line.

36:10.585 --> 36:11.752
Don't cross the dick line.

36:12.795 --> 36:15.631
We both should've qualified
as individuals. It's not fair.

36:15.715 --> 36:18.092
- Or sometimes you lose.
- You know what I mean.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.344
You should've seen
how dumb some of those kids were.

36:20.428 --> 36:23.097
I'm sure they're talented.
Talented in their own way.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.474
One of them didn't know
the capital of New Mexico.

36:25.558 --> 36:26.976
Oh, that's embarrassing.

36:27.059 --> 36:28.769
- Albuquerque.
- Santa Fe.

36:28.853 --> 36:29.770
I know.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.440
Listen, you're the two best debaters
in the county.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.193
Together, you could qualify for State
and that's another thing

36:35.276 --> 36:38.446
you can send off to Harvard, right?

36:38.529 --> 36:41.649
- You're wasting your time. We lost.
- Can you let me finish?

36:41.782 --> 36:44.368
- The deadline passed.
- But we have the twins' slot.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.054
- What happened to the twins?
- They dropped out.

36:46.078 --> 36:47.455
- Of the tournament?
- Of the club.

36:50.833 --> 36:51.833
Lona, stop.

36:53.711 --> 36:56.923
I need this for Yale.
And you want to get into Harvard.

36:57.006 --> 36:59.634
We already turned in our applications.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.303
Come on, we both know
that the admissions office

37:02.386 --> 37:04.472
will take into consideration
any honors we receive

37:04.555 --> 37:06.724
while they're making their decisions.

37:06.807 --> 37:08.935
- We wouldn't qualify.
- Yes, we would.

37:09.018 --> 37:12.396
- No, you have extremely bad habits.
- You disrespect your opponents.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.607
- You disrespect the judges.
- You have bad breath.

37:14.690 --> 37:17.109
- You have... Stupid face!
- A stupid face.

37:17.193 --> 37:19.779
I think you meant to say
you have a stupid face.

37:19.862 --> 37:22.865
No, actually,
I meant to say that you're a dick.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.619
Do you... Do you think I want this?

37:26.702 --> 37:28.462
- I certainly don't.
- Neither do I.

37:28.537 --> 37:29.681
Out of everyone in this school,

37:29.705 --> 37:31.785
you're literally the last person
I want to work with.

37:31.832 --> 37:34.460
- The very, very last.
- Thank you.

37:34.543 --> 37:36.671
You're egocentric,
you speed through crossfire

37:36.754 --> 37:38.339
and you refuse to flow rounds.

37:40.341 --> 37:41.884
I flow every single one of my rounds.

37:41.968 --> 37:45.096
And for your information,
when you speed through crossfire,

37:45.179 --> 37:47.574
you get through more questions
and you make the other team nervous.

37:47.598 --> 37:49.517
No, I think you're right,
we wouldn't qualify.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.061
- You're just not good enough.
- Oh, please.

37:52.144 --> 37:54.414
I could carry us both through qualifiers
and state championship.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.416
- You think we'd win?
- Yeah, if you got out of my way.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.316
- Prove it.
- I will.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.420
So it's agreed. You'll prove me wrong,
we'll play as a team, qualify next month,

38:00.444 --> 38:01.612
and win the state tournament.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.531
We'll start studying after school
at my place.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.224
I'll give the opening statement.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.583
No, I'm gonna give the opening statement.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.395
Bennett, the round is one
of the first five minutes.

38:16.419 --> 38:19.171
You make too many arguments
and don't impact any of them.

38:19.255 --> 38:22.008
So we lose the round because of that.
In addition to that...

38:22.091 --> 38:23.735
If you did your work
for the amount of time

38:23.759 --> 38:25.696
- you spend arguing with me...
- I'm already done.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.930
I'm already done.
I already finished page two.

38:28.014 --> 38:31.142
- Well, start page three.
- There is no page three.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.522
No. No.

38:36.605 --> 38:37.606
- No, no.
- Stop.

38:37.690 --> 38:38.524
Excuse me.

38:38.607 --> 38:39.483
- What?
- No.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.254
Ask any teacher, they will tell you
that when you write something physically,

38:42.278 --> 38:44.715
it sticks to your brain better
than when you do it on your computer.

38:44.739 --> 38:47.366
Excuse me. Thank you.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.428
- Condescending tone?
- Which the judges do not appreciate.

38:49.452 --> 38:51.912
And besides,
it sets the tone for the entire round.

38:51.996 --> 38:55.583
My judges appreciate my tone.
I have a very welcoming tone.

39:15.436 --> 39:17.730
Okay, enough, Picasso.
I'll make these last changes

39:17.813 --> 39:19.482
- and email them to you.
- Or I can do it.

39:19.565 --> 39:21.484
- No, I can do it.
- I can easily do it.

39:21.567 --> 39:23.819
Yeah, you can easily do
a lot of things, Bennett.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.740
Look, I'll make the changes
and see you tomorrow.

39:29.492 --> 39:30.576
We're gonna do great.

39:40.378 --> 39:43.214
I know I've said it a thousand times,
but I really am sorry.

39:43.798 --> 39:45.758
- It's fine, Mom.
- No, it's not.

39:45.841 --> 39:48.469
I let Julia get under my tits,
and then I made it worse.

39:48.552 --> 39:50.888
If I had just kept
my hilarious mouth shut,

39:50.971 --> 39:52.611
you would've already qualified for State.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.100
Or maybe I just lost that day.

39:54.183 --> 39:56.936
Are you kidding me? Did you see
how stupid some of those kids were?

39:58.229 --> 39:59.229
Talented.

40:00.356 --> 40:01.356
In their own way.

40:03.442 --> 40:06.195
Whoa! Take it easy with that stuff.
They won't even recognize you.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.698
Look, I'm just... I'm flustered, okay?

40:09.782 --> 40:11.075
We have no chemistry.

40:11.158 --> 40:14.036
We disagree in strategy,
we have opposite routines and I just...

40:14.120 --> 40:15.454
I don't know how it's gonna work!

40:16.831 --> 40:19.351
I just wanted to tell you
that I spoke to the debate leadership

40:19.375 --> 40:20.793
on the county and state levels

40:20.876 --> 40:24.588
about Amy's primal impulses
and that unfortunate altercation.

40:24.672 --> 40:27.216
And they assured me
that I was in the right, of course,

40:27.299 --> 40:29.427
and that you would be judged fairly.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.429
- Whatever.
- Well... No.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.764
This is good news, Bennett.

40:35.474 --> 40:37.452
You are going to qualify
for the state tournament today

40:37.476 --> 40:40.229
and you are going to win
the state tournament.

40:40.312 --> 40:42.731
And you will go to Yale in the fall.

40:42.815 --> 40:44.876
But first, I have to compete
in the debate tournament

40:44.900 --> 40:47.236
with a brand new partner
whom I've hated my entire life.

40:47.319 --> 40:49.864
We all know who's carrying this team.

40:50.990 --> 40:52.241
Goodbye, Mom.

41:25.774 --> 41:27.067
- Excuse me.
- Would you...?

41:29.737 --> 41:32.537
We negate that the cost of college
education is outweighed by benefits.

41:35.784 --> 41:38.704
We affirm the costs of a college
education are outweighed by the benefits.

41:42.625 --> 41:43.876
That's the right height.

41:43.959 --> 41:45.437
Look at the difference of the height.

41:45.461 --> 41:47.272
...indicates college graduates
are more likely to earn higher salaries

41:47.296 --> 41:49.173
pay more taxes, taxed at a higher rate...

41:53.385 --> 41:54.821
- This is our area.
- Get it out of my area.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.430
We're on a team. This is our area.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.394
Without college educations, prospective
employees will be ill-equipped...

42:03.729 --> 42:05.105
That's why you must vote neg.

42:14.198 --> 42:15.866
Is anyone not ready?

42:17.910 --> 42:20.579
Our high school is inferior to yours.

42:23.749 --> 42:25.501
We'd bet you money, if we had any.

42:25.584 --> 42:27.503
We have no fancy research databases,

42:27.586 --> 42:29.338
no personal laptop computers.

42:29.421 --> 42:32.883
No debate coaches with
national championships on their résumé.

42:32.967 --> 42:36.011
No, our debate coach works at Sears
on the weekends

42:36.095 --> 42:37.680
because he needs the money.

42:37.763 --> 42:39.974
So the moment that timer starts,

42:40.057 --> 42:42.893
we're already ten steps behind
and are forced to play catch-up.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.895
Well, we don't have to worry about them.

42:44.979 --> 42:46.772
What? Why not?

42:46.855 --> 42:48.524
They're good, really good.

42:48.607 --> 42:52.236
This approach rarely wins. Replacing
feelings for facts is not debate.

42:52.319 --> 42:53.612
The judges will see through it.

42:53.696 --> 42:55.781
- Have you ever debated against it?
- Have you?

42:55.864 --> 42:58.492
Jania Santos. Want to hear her story?

42:58.576 --> 42:59.970
She was top of her high school class.

42:59.994 --> 43:02.079
Went to a fancy liberal arts school
on the East Coast

43:02.162 --> 43:04.623
and graduated
with a BA in European History.

43:04.707 --> 43:06.307
And guess what she's doing now?

43:07.334 --> 43:08.168
Sears.

43:08.252 --> 43:10.254
She's working at Sears
with our debate coach!

43:10.337 --> 43:12.232
You know, what are these colleges
really offering

43:12.256 --> 43:14.008
if they're not offering careers?

43:14.091 --> 43:15.801
- It's bullshit!
- It's bullshit!

43:15.884 --> 43:19.221
All I'm saying is how do we prepare
to debate someone's personal experiences?

43:19.305 --> 43:20.991
There's no way
to anticipate what they'll say.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.615
No. We dismiss it as contrary
to the framework of the debate topic

43:23.684 --> 43:26.162
and the judges will agree
that what they're saying is meaningless.

43:26.186 --> 43:28.480
You think what they're saying
is meaningless?

43:28.564 --> 43:30.858
I think that the facts will always win
and you do, too.

43:40.743 --> 43:42.036
See what I told you?

43:42.119 --> 43:44.472
Honestly, they shouldn't even
give a trophy for a qualifier.

43:44.496 --> 43:45.414
You can have it.

43:45.497 --> 43:47.333
You earned it. Give yourself a break.

43:47.416 --> 43:50.294
- I don't have time for breaks.
- You're nervous, aren't you?

43:50.377 --> 43:52.796
- About State?
- No, about getting into Harvard.

43:52.880 --> 43:53.964
It's this Friday.

43:54.048 --> 43:55.650
- You told them you qualified?
- Yeah, I did.

43:55.674 --> 43:58.427
You're a four-time qualifier.
That's amazing!

43:58.510 --> 44:00.095
Yeah, but am I gonna get in?

44:00.179 --> 44:01.656
- You'll do great.
- You don't know that.

44:01.680 --> 44:02.848
They'd be lucky to have you.

44:02.931 --> 44:04.534
Look, Harvard has a five percent
acceptance rate.

44:04.558 --> 44:07.353
That means that there's a 95 percent
chance that I don't get in.

44:07.436 --> 44:09.188
- Maybe you're different.
- Maybe I'm not.

44:09.271 --> 44:10.391
Maybe I'm not any different.

44:10.439 --> 44:13.567
Maybe I'm just another robot
who spends too much time in the library.

44:13.651 --> 44:16.654
- Is that really what you think?
- I don't know and neither do you.

44:20.240 --> 44:21.240
Okay.

44:22.076 --> 44:23.661
Fine.

44:23.744 --> 44:24.744
You're right.

44:25.579 --> 44:29.249
It doesn't look good.
In fact, it looks pretty shitty.

44:29.333 --> 44:32.711
We're talking about Harvard, so the odds
are clearly stacked against you

44:32.795 --> 44:34.672
and it's more than likely
you'll be rejected.

44:36.048 --> 44:37.508
Is that better?

44:37.591 --> 44:39.885
Lona, I don't have a clue
where you're gonna end up.

44:39.968 --> 44:41.220
Not in a year.

44:41.804 --> 44:43.639
Not ten years from now.

44:43.722 --> 44:45.891
We don't know what's gonna happen.
Nobody does.

44:48.519 --> 44:50.979
No matter where you go,
will you promise me something?

44:51.063 --> 44:52.231
What?

44:52.815 --> 44:53.899
You're not gonna like it.

44:55.609 --> 44:59.988
In fact, many extremely successful people
will completely disagree with me.

45:00.697 --> 45:04.535
I don't know. I hesitate
to even bring it up. Maybe I'll just...

45:04.618 --> 45:05.818
Where are you going with this?

45:09.081 --> 45:10.707
When I started working here,

45:11.917 --> 45:12.917
that wall was empty.

45:16.088 --> 45:18.132
That bookcase was empty.

45:20.676 --> 45:23.679
And then kids like you left.

45:24.638 --> 45:28.183
And they got into their dream school,
or they didn't.

45:29.435 --> 45:32.020
But all of them went on to do stuff.

45:33.188 --> 45:34.231
Make stuff.

45:35.232 --> 45:36.692
And so they sent me stuff.

45:38.861 --> 45:42.364
And I'm not sure
but I think that's a life.

45:47.619 --> 45:49.204
Wherever you end up, kiddo,

45:50.456 --> 45:51.498
have fun.

46:25.532 --> 46:26.532
Now. Now.

46:28.911 --> 46:30.579
Okay, let's type in my password.

46:36.627 --> 46:38.795
Okay, here we go.

46:38.879 --> 46:41.548
No matter what happens,
I love you and I'm so proud of you.

46:41.632 --> 46:42.674
Your father would be, too.

46:45.844 --> 46:46.844
All right.

46:59.525 --> 47:01.109
Here it is. Here it is.

48:28.071 --> 48:28.989
I'm sorry.

48:29.072 --> 48:30.657
I thought you were already up.

48:51.386 --> 48:53.388
Well, he's the valedictorian of his class

48:53.472 --> 48:57.559
and a living president
wrote his letter of recommendation.

48:57.643 --> 48:59.853
Look, I'm not saying
that you made a mistake,

48:59.936 --> 49:02.147
but I wouldn't be surprised if you had.

49:02.230 --> 49:05.359
No, I'm not trying to tell you
how to run your institution,

49:05.442 --> 49:08.695
but as an alumnus, I'm saying
I'm exceptionally disappointed

49:08.779 --> 49:10.072
by your decision.

49:10.155 --> 49:14.618
Well, obviously, you're forgetting
that I contributed $100,000...

49:15.410 --> 49:17.329
- Are you out of your mind?
- Bennett.

49:17.412 --> 49:20.207
- You're not helping.
- You know what? You're right.

49:20.290 --> 49:23.835
Why don't we fly out there again
and have another in-person interview?

49:23.919 --> 49:25.796
- They've made up their minds.
- No.

49:25.879 --> 49:27.589
It's not that simple... Bennett.

49:27.673 --> 49:30.425
Bennett, it's never that simple.

49:30.509 --> 49:31.718
I know these people.

49:31.802 --> 49:33.762
Sometimes you just have
to bend their arm...

49:33.845 --> 49:36.139
No! There's no bending.

49:36.223 --> 49:38.684
They saw the application,
and it wasn't good enough.

49:38.767 --> 49:40.435
End of story. Sometimes you lose.

49:40.519 --> 49:41.937
Lose?

49:42.020 --> 49:43.522
What are you...?

49:43.605 --> 49:44.856
No.

49:44.940 --> 49:49.236
We still have plenty of time for me
to call my friend who owes me.

49:49.319 --> 49:52.080
The only thing I should focus on
is that dude in the mirror, remember?

49:52.155 --> 49:53.448
This is different.

49:53.532 --> 49:55.677
You have to start considering a world
where I don't go to Yale.

49:55.701 --> 49:56.719
This is your future, Bennett.

49:56.743 --> 49:58.745
I'm gonna need you
to take it a bit more seriously.

49:58.829 --> 50:00.455
You don't think I know that?

50:01.039 --> 50:02.809
You know how much time
I've spent trying to get in?

50:02.833 --> 50:04.543
How many classes I've taken?

50:04.626 --> 50:06.253
How many nights I've gotten no sleep?

50:06.336 --> 50:09.005
I wanted it bad. But so what?

50:09.089 --> 50:11.258
Will I not have a future
if I don't go to Yale?

50:11.341 --> 50:13.009
Not as bright a future.

50:17.639 --> 50:18.682
Wow!

50:18.765 --> 50:19.765
So it's all bullshit?

50:19.808 --> 50:20.934
What?

50:21.017 --> 50:22.203
You give out college scholarships

50:22.227 --> 50:23.746
- to poor kids who can't afford it.
- Bennett.

50:23.770 --> 50:26.416
They're not going to Yale or Harvard.
You send them to public school.

50:26.440 --> 50:29.818
- Why do you do it if it's such a waste?
- Because they have nothing!

50:30.610 --> 50:33.447
We give them something to hold on to.

50:33.530 --> 50:34.364
You...

50:34.448 --> 50:37.159
Bennett, you come from everything.

50:37.242 --> 50:39.870
And you expect everything!

50:39.953 --> 50:41.580
And anything less is a disappointment.

50:41.663 --> 50:43.832
- No.
- No. That's what you're saying.

50:43.915 --> 50:45.101
The expectations are so high...

50:45.125 --> 50:48.128
Yale made it possible for a girl like me
who comes from nothing

50:48.211 --> 50:50.505
to make something of herself.

50:50.589 --> 50:52.841
- So it's Yale or nothing?
- That's not what I'm saying.

50:52.924 --> 50:54.134
Then what are you saying, Mom?

50:54.843 --> 50:56.052
Hmm?

50:57.387 --> 50:58.972
Yeah. That's what I thought.

50:59.973 --> 51:00.973
Bennett.

51:41.598 --> 51:43.767
Good morning.
What do you have for me?

51:44.601 --> 51:46.686
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

51:53.485 --> 51:55.153
Can I help you guys?

51:55.237 --> 51:57.197
I was just waiting to see Kathy.

51:57.739 --> 51:59.115
Yeah, me, too.

52:03.578 --> 52:04.579
I'm sorry. Uh...

52:05.997 --> 52:07.958
Kathy passed away.

52:09.793 --> 52:12.838
Kathy, the guidance counselor.
The candy...

52:14.881 --> 52:18.343
Kathy was in an accident...

52:18.426 --> 52:20.887
after school on Friday.

52:23.223 --> 52:24.223
I'm...

52:28.019 --> 52:30.397
...about to make the announcement
to the rest of the school.

52:32.816 --> 52:33.816
I'm so sorry.

54:13.458 --> 54:16.670
On the way over, I sort of thought
we were gonna see Kathy here.

54:17.921 --> 54:19.381
I know that doesn't make any sense.

54:19.464 --> 54:23.677
But, I mean,
it's, like, her funeral, and so...

54:24.552 --> 54:26.429
she should be here, you know?

54:28.098 --> 54:29.098
Yeah.

54:29.975 --> 54:31.893
I felt that way about your dad's service.

54:33.979 --> 54:35.772
You remember my dad's service?

54:37.857 --> 54:38.858
We were six.

54:40.735 --> 54:42.904
It was the first funeral
I had ever been to.

54:44.739 --> 54:46.866
Yeah, mine, too.

54:56.584 --> 54:57.584
Hey, uh...

54:58.420 --> 55:00.171
I watched that fast food documentary.

55:01.881 --> 55:03.008
You were right.

55:03.091 --> 55:06.344
Eating that junk food
could seriously damage your organs.

55:06.428 --> 55:07.971
I told you.

55:08.054 --> 55:09.806
Yeah. Milkshakes are no good.

55:11.141 --> 55:12.183
And fries.

55:26.239 --> 55:27.239
Did you get in?

55:29.159 --> 55:30.159
No.

55:31.411 --> 55:32.411
You?

55:34.664 --> 55:35.664
No.

55:42.756 --> 55:44.049
What did we do it for?

55:46.176 --> 55:47.635
What?

55:47.719 --> 55:48.719
Everything.

55:50.138 --> 55:52.557
I mean, I don't think
we were ever really high schoolers.

55:53.391 --> 55:56.478
Are you telling me that I dreamed up
all those classes and tests?

55:56.561 --> 55:57.896
No, I'm saying we never...

56:00.065 --> 56:01.775
How many football games did you go to?

56:03.860 --> 56:05.278
I don't believe in football.

56:05.361 --> 56:08.031
Neither do I. How about parties?

56:08.615 --> 56:10.450
I believe in them even less.

56:10.533 --> 56:12.494
What about goofing off in class?

56:12.577 --> 56:14.537
Or passing stupid notes?

56:15.288 --> 56:17.415
Or laughing at a joke so hard
that you start crying?

56:17.999 --> 56:19.459
Is that high school to you?

56:19.542 --> 56:20.542
I don't know.

56:21.503 --> 56:23.421
I was too busy with...

56:23.505 --> 56:28.384
with homework, tests and debate.

56:28.468 --> 56:29.886
Yeah, that's high school.

56:31.679 --> 56:34.641
Okay, if it is,
how come you don't have tons of friends?

56:40.105 --> 56:41.439
Shut up. You don't know me.

56:52.992 --> 56:53.992
Hey.

56:55.829 --> 56:56.746
If you're anything like me,

56:56.830 --> 56:59.040
Kathy was the only person
you could really talk to.

57:02.418 --> 57:05.713
What if everything we went through
will be the exact same in college?

57:08.466 --> 57:09.467
You think so?

57:11.678 --> 57:14.180
I'm pretty sure the Ivy League
has football games and parties,

57:14.264 --> 57:18.685
and there's always gonna be someone
passing stupid drawings.

57:24.399 --> 57:26.109
What's your point?

57:27.694 --> 57:29.028
I wish I had one.

57:34.701 --> 57:36.453
We could really use Kathy right now.

57:39.789 --> 57:40.999
Yeah.

57:50.550 --> 57:52.719
...and what makes this table so expensive

57:52.802 --> 57:54.596
is it's made of desert ironwood

57:54.679 --> 57:58.766
from a perennial flowering tree
of the Fabaceae family.

57:58.850 --> 58:01.394
Desert ironwood? Are you sure?

58:01.978 --> 58:04.522
You don't come across
desert ironwood every day, so yes.

58:04.606 --> 58:08.234
Don't get me wrong, it's really nice
having you here on the couch,

58:09.611 --> 58:10.987
but it's just not you.

58:14.616 --> 58:16.701
State tournament's in a few weeks.

58:18.286 --> 58:19.305
I'm sorry it's with Bennett...

58:19.329 --> 58:21.289
Is there anything that you like
about Julia?

58:23.458 --> 58:24.458
What?

58:25.793 --> 58:27.128
Anything at all.

58:38.515 --> 58:43.978
Her first ever campaign slogan
was "Julia Russell is the right stuff."

58:44.062 --> 58:45.647
Never mind.

58:45.730 --> 58:49.359
Come on!
New Kids on the Block? That's amazing.

58:50.777 --> 58:55.073
We ran against each other
for class president and I kicked her ass.

58:55.156 --> 58:57.951
That's right. The cheerleader
took down the bookworm.

58:58.785 --> 59:01.829
It was brutal, though. We were vicious.

59:03.456 --> 59:04.958
Still bugs her.

59:08.378 --> 59:09.462
I'll tell you a secret.

59:12.423 --> 59:13.591
I vote for her.

59:15.134 --> 59:16.386
She gets things done.

59:17.845 --> 59:21.224
She was on every Top 30 Under 30 list.

59:22.475 --> 59:24.227
And then she adopted Bennett.

59:24.310 --> 59:26.062
And then she became a senator.

59:27.480 --> 59:30.733
And she seems to balance it all
on her own.

59:33.486 --> 59:35.321
She's a great mom. It's very annoying.

59:38.658 --> 59:39.951
I'm gonna finish my show.

59:41.536 --> 59:42.537
Leave me alone.

59:49.252 --> 59:53.881
So, after four years
of not agreeing on anything,

59:53.965 --> 59:57.427
the first thing you both agree on
is to not compete in the state tournament.

59:59.345 --> 01:00:00.847
So you both agree for the first time

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.141
and now you're both silent
for the first time.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.316
Since when are you two the quitting kind?

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:16.529
So, you didn't get
into your dream schools.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:20.033
There are greater tragedies in this world.

01:00:21.075 --> 01:00:23.703
What, were you trying to prove
to your moms that you... what?

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.331
Prove what?

01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:30.251
Oh, you two are so full of crap.

01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:32.712
You're five-foot nothing.
You're a hundred and nothing.

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:35.048
You hardly got
a speck of athletic ability.

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:37.234
And you hung in with the best
college football team in the land

01:00:37.258 --> 01:00:38.258
for the past two years.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.011
And you're both about
to walk out of here

01:00:40.094 --> 01:00:43.389
with a degree
from the University of Notre Dame.

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:46.702
Mr. Johnson, what are you talking about?

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:49.562
Oh, come on.
Don't tell me you've never seen Rudy.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:53.691
That is one of the best, most recognizable
motivational speeches in all of film.

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:55.777
Everybody loves Rudy.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:57.862
What's your point?

01:00:57.945 --> 01:01:00.615
If you add state champions
to your résumé next month,

01:01:00.698 --> 01:01:02.659
that's only gonna help
your chances everywhere.

01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:05.995
I guarantee there won't be
a week in your life that goes by

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:10.458
that you won't regret walking out
and letting them get the best of you.

01:01:11.417 --> 01:01:13.461
Do you hear me clear enough?

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:17.548
"I rode the bench for two years.

01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:20.218
I thought I wasn't being played
because of my color."

01:01:20.301 --> 01:01:21.469
Is this that movie again?

01:01:21.552 --> 01:01:24.430
I am honestly nailing it here
but I'd like to go from the beginning,

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:25.807
- uninterrupt...
- Just stop.

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:30.436
I do things by myself.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.564
I've always done things
by myself my whole life.

01:01:35.149 --> 01:01:38.444
I want to win so bad
that it physically hurts.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:42.573
Maybe it'll help me get into school,
maybe it won't.

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.203
I just... I want to win.

01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:50.206
What are you saying?

01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:53.459
I'm saying that we should play football.

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:56.962
Then let's play.

01:01:58.214 --> 01:02:00.633
Okay. Rudy from the top.

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:05.072
Mom, Bennett and I are gonna be
working in here for a while.

01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:06.472
- Okay.
- Hi, Mrs. Skinner.

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:08.391
Wait, what?

01:02:09.016 --> 01:02:10.393
Whoa!

01:02:13.104 --> 01:02:15.940
- Thank you for having me, Ms. Skinner.
- Of course, Bennett.

01:02:23.364 --> 01:02:24.991
Mom, you should put on some pants.

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:29.245
You could focus on aff.
I could focus on neg.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.126
Can I get you something to eat, Bennett?

01:02:35.209 --> 01:02:37.086
Uh, no, I'm okay.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:39.672
We're okay.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:40.757
Something to drink?

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.260
- We've got water, juice, soda, beer.
- Beer?

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:47.930
I'm fine. Thank you.

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:49.214
Well, I made cookies yesterday

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:51.851
so I'll go get some of those
and, um, some milk.

01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:58.483
I'm sorry.
Can you please give me a second?

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:04.947
- What's the matter with you?
- You didn't tell me he was coming over.

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:07.784
- I'm allowed to bring someone over.
- But him?

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:12.872
The last thing we need is Julia knowing
what this place looks like.

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:14.540
Or my exercise regimen.

01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:16.876
Or my lack of pants.

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:20.129
- He doesn't care about that stuff.
- Yeah, well, she does.

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:24.383
Tell him the dining room table
is desert ironwood

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:27.595
from the penal flowering tree
of the Fibonacci family.

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:31.390
- You're being ridiculous.
- No, I'm not.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:32.308
Get back out there.

01:03:32.391 --> 01:03:34.578
You don't want him to think
we're talking about him behind his back.

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:35.812
I'm not. You are.

01:03:41.108 --> 01:03:42.108
Thank you.

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:46.364
Wow.

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:48.824
Hmm.

01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:52.411
Mm.

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:54.080
Wow.

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:56.916
They're my mom's recipe.
I'm sure you've had better.

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:58.918
No, I don't think so.

01:04:00.711 --> 01:04:04.674
I like to let the cookie soak in there,
you know. It enriches the flavor.

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:07.676
You're weird.

01:04:16.602 --> 01:04:18.479
For our guest.

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:21.774
Oh, thank you.

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:23.901
Whoa!

01:04:24.485 --> 01:04:25.862
Thanks.

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:26.945
Try it.

01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:33.119
Not... No, no, no.
Not a dip. Dunk it.

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:35.389
- Dunk it and hold it. Hold...
- I did dunk it.

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:36.413
Oh, my God.

01:04:41.085 --> 01:04:43.963
- No. No.
- Yep.

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:44.881
Studying over.

01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:47.008
- Special for you.
- Take a break. Take a break.

01:04:54.765 --> 01:04:56.225
Yeah.

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:58.769
This is so good. What's in it?

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:01.647
You got milk on these.

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:04.400
Let's dry it off.

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:07.153
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.841
We affirm that the costs of a college

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:12.505
education are outweighed by the benefits.

01:05:15.494 --> 01:05:16.329
Trade schools...

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:17.246
Trade schools are far better option...

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.040
Can you switch out the two?

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:22.960
...college education system.

01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:24.503
I'll share.

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:26.172
- Nice.
- I'm feeling nice today.

01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:30.092
Finally.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.354
That is why you must vote aff.

01:05:44.982 --> 01:05:46.734
You guys, I'm going to bed.

01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:50.738
Bennett, if you're too tired to drive
home, feel free to crash on our couch.

01:05:50.821 --> 01:05:53.491
I left out a, um, pillow
and a blanket for you.

01:05:54.492 --> 01:05:55.492
Thanks, Ms. Skinner.

01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:57.995
Don't stay up too late.

01:05:58.537 --> 01:06:00.498
- Good night, Mom. Love you.
- Love you.

01:06:05.503 --> 01:06:06.503
You think we're good?

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:09.674
I've never prepared this much evidence
for a tournament.

01:06:11.175 --> 01:06:12.175
Me neither.

01:06:15.846 --> 01:06:17.348
You think we can win this thing?

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:21.935
Me, too.

01:06:24.897 --> 01:06:25.897
All right.

01:06:27.566 --> 01:06:29.402
We make a good team.

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:37.284
- You should take these.
- I'll take...

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:07.690
The debate is this weekend.

01:07:10.401 --> 01:07:11.819
Right.

01:07:11.902 --> 01:07:13.320
Uh, um...

01:07:14.613 --> 01:07:15.656
We should...

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:19.160
I should take every... Well, everything.

01:07:19.243 --> 01:07:20.243
Yeah.

01:07:20.661 --> 01:07:21.661
Bennett, I...

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.874
Tomorrow. Yeah.

01:07:44.685 --> 01:07:46.270
Next!

01:07:47.104 --> 01:07:48.773
Oh!

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:52.252
- Sorry. I'm such a klutz.
- It's okay. I can do it for you.

01:07:52.276 --> 01:07:54.504
- Just focus on the customers.
- I can do it here. I've got it.

01:07:54.528 --> 01:07:57.073
I wasn't saying you couldn't do it.
All I was saying was...

01:07:57.156 --> 01:07:59.158
Got it. Customers.

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:00.951
How can I help you?

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:07.750
You were really out of line
at the regional qualifier.

01:08:09.126 --> 01:08:13.422
I mean, they just asked me to speak,
and you obviously wanted to sabotage me.

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:15.757
I'm sorry.

01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:18.344
What can I get you?

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:20.470
Chai tea latte with milk.

01:08:21.805 --> 01:08:22.807
4.50.

01:08:23.849 --> 01:08:25.725
- Anything else?
- Also...

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:29.897
Bennett has been spending
a lot of time at your house...

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:32.149
I know. I'm sorry about not wearing pants.

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:33.859
- What?
- What?

01:08:34.984 --> 01:08:36.112
Okay, you go.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.279
Well...

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:40.216
He doesn't like my desserts,

01:08:40.241 --> 01:08:43.618
and he can't seem to stop talking
about your damn cookies.

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:48.832
- Really?
- Yes, really. And it is very annoying.

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:50.416
But...

01:08:51.417 --> 01:08:53.462
Well, I just thought that, um...

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:58.300
Is it possible to get the recipe?

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:02.638
Yeah. Sure.

01:09:03.889 --> 01:09:04.889
It's not...

01:09:06.892 --> 01:09:09.979
If you can hang for a few minutes,
I'm about to be on break.

01:09:10.895 --> 01:09:11.897
Okay.

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.524
Chai latte.

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:17.109
Sorry about that.

01:09:21.365 --> 01:09:22.365
Well played.

01:09:26.953 --> 01:09:28.497
- Everything okay? We good?
- Yep.

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:29.707
Okay. All right.

01:09:33.085 --> 01:09:36.255
Shakespeare didn't write
the first Romeo and Juliet story

01:09:36.337 --> 01:09:39.508
but he wrote the best
Romeo and Juliet story.

01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:43.220
Take the confidants...
the friar, the nurse, you see,

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:45.471
things out of Shakespeare...

01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:05.784
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:36.815
♪ You fill my ears with the songs I love

01:10:37.524 --> 01:10:38.817
Hey.

01:10:39.610 --> 01:10:40.444
Um...

01:10:40.527 --> 01:10:42.988
Did you get my email with the revisions?

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:45.324
Yeah, they're good,
but I'm making my tweaks.

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:47.201
I'll email them to you in the morning.

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:50.079
Here are the essays we were looking for

01:10:50.162 --> 01:10:52.373
about higher education
at the turn of the century.

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:55.376
It's not a great argument, but...

01:10:56.293 --> 01:10:58.003
Just in case our opponents bring it up.

01:11:02.174 --> 01:11:04.134
I'll see you in the morning, okay?

01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:07.263
Listen, about what happened
last night, I...

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:13.894
I'm supposed to hate you.

01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:16.397
- Lona, I...
- No, my whole life I've hated you.

01:11:18.148 --> 01:11:20.109
Not because I knew you, but because...

01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:25.155
I thought you hated me, too.

01:11:27.866 --> 01:11:30.035
But this other thing,

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:34.581
this thing where we study together
and eat cookies...

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.669
Well, I just don't think
that's what I'm good at.

01:11:38.752 --> 01:11:40.188
- I disagree.
- Of course you disagree.

01:11:40.212 --> 01:11:42.172
Disagreeing is what we do best.

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:47.511
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

01:12:02.192 --> 01:12:06.322
♪ You fill my ears with the songs I love

01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:21.378
Hey. Hey.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.174
Huh?

01:12:25.257 --> 01:12:26.550
I think it's time for bed.

01:12:28.218 --> 01:12:29.470
What time is it?

01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:32.097
It's late. I texted you,
but your phone was off.

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:33.181
Oh.

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:36.810
Oh, my gosh.

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:38.771
Where did you get these?

01:12:38.854 --> 01:12:39.854
What?

01:12:40.147 --> 01:12:41.398
Oh.

01:12:41.482 --> 01:12:42.816
I made them.

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.360
At that French bakery you love?

01:12:45.944 --> 01:12:48.238
No. I made them.

01:12:48.322 --> 01:12:51.617
- You ordered them online?
- No, I made them, okay?

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:55.537
Just... don't go in the kitchen.
It's a mess.

01:12:56.413 --> 01:12:57.413
Oh.

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:04.796
Mm.

01:13:07.925 --> 01:13:08.925
Thank you.

01:13:17.684 --> 01:13:18.684
You're welcome.

01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:47.190
...affirm the costs
of college education...

01:13:47.214 --> 01:13:48.483
[girl 1 ...are outweighed by the benefits.

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:50.026
College graduates earn more
over their lifetime...

01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:52.890
Those with a college education
fare better than high school graduates...

01:14:02.479 --> 01:14:04.040
While our opponents
will try to argue future innovations

01:14:04.064 --> 01:14:05.732
in the system should be encompassed...

01:14:10.362 --> 01:14:11.947
Who is helping me? Who is helping us?

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:14.408
Where is the priority
of getting low income...?

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:31.592
...to national and global economies.
That is why you must vote neg.

01:14:38.515 --> 01:14:39.850
All right.

01:14:39.933 --> 01:14:40.933
Is anyone not ready?

01:14:42.102 --> 01:14:43.371
- We negate the costs...
- We affirm the costs...

01:14:43.395 --> 01:14:45.275
...of a college education
outweigh the benefits.

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:09.903
- That is why must vote neg.
- That is why you must vote aff.

01:15:11.381 --> 01:15:12.799
In a two-to-one decision,

01:15:13.383 --> 01:15:16.720
from Hemlock Prep Academy,
Lona Skinner and Bennett Russell.

01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:24.228
Good evening, everyone.

01:15:24.811 --> 01:15:26.813
Welcome to the final debate.

01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:29.775
Who will be named
the best team in the state?

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:31.944
You're about to find out.

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:36.657
First, from Hemlock Prep Academy,
Bennett Russell and Lona Skinner.

01:15:41.328 --> 01:15:45.624
And from Washington High,
Jasmine Spencer and Dana Martinez.

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:50.745
Good luck to you both.

01:15:51.838 --> 01:15:53.632
And now, let's begin.

01:16:04.184 --> 01:16:05.811
Is anybody not ready?

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.291
Do you know what I did this morning?
I pinched myself.

01:16:10.315 --> 01:16:11.149
I know, right?

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:15.028
It's a cliché, but I thought I was
dreaming. We shouldn't be up here.

01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:17.990
Take a look around the room,
and then look at us.

01:16:19.866 --> 01:16:21.326
We shouldn't be here.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.245
No, we deserve it,
but we shouldn't be here

01:16:23.328 --> 01:16:25.122
because we should be working.

01:16:25.205 --> 01:16:29.251
The truth is we can't afford to be here
and we don't want to be here.

01:16:29.334 --> 01:16:32.713
I mean, honestly,
do any of you really want to be here?

01:16:32.796 --> 01:16:36.133
Do you actually enjoy giving up
your Saturdays to debate public policy?

01:16:36.216 --> 01:16:37.216
Hell, no.

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:40.095
But since you were born into privilege,
you're expected to, right?

01:16:40.178 --> 01:16:41.823
That's just messed up,

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:43.056
both for you and me.

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.225
So, what do we affirm?

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:46.935
Our aff is that this process, no,

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:50.814
this business of college admissions
outweighs the benefits.

01:16:50.897 --> 01:16:52.107
And it is so overbearing

01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:55.110
that it's turning young people
into robots,

01:16:55.193 --> 01:16:59.489
forcing us to make critical decisions
about our future at the age of 16.

01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:01.283
Are you kidding me?

01:17:01.366 --> 01:17:04.536
I mean, just think about it.
I can't vote or drink,

01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:07.456
and yet my entire adult life

01:17:07.539 --> 01:17:11.668
is dependent upon my GPA,
AP courses, and community service?

01:17:11.752 --> 01:17:13.045
You know our story by now.

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:16.548
You know that our families
actually need the money.

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:19.468
You're asking me if college is worth it.

01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:22.679
The better question is,
"Who is helping me? Who is helping us?"

01:17:22.763 --> 01:17:26.808
Where is the priority of getting
low-income students through high school?

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:28.977
- Because we don't see it.
- We don't see it.

01:17:50.248 --> 01:17:52.250
Hey, Bennett,
can I have the notes, please?

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:53.334
Thanks.

01:17:59.716 --> 01:18:01.802
Is anyone not ready?

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.873
Bennett and I negate
the costs of a college education

01:18:13.897 --> 01:18:15.232
outweigh the benefits.

01:18:15.315 --> 01:18:18.235
Our first contention is that
our opponents, in their opening statement,

01:18:18.318 --> 01:18:21.154
have shown complete disregard
for the topic, and thus, the frame...

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:22.465
the framework in which we debate.

01:18:22.489 --> 01:18:24.741
Their blatant disrespect...

01:18:35.836 --> 01:18:37.337
Oh.

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:01.736
You know what?

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:04.656
Jasmine and Dana are right.

01:19:06.616 --> 01:19:07.951
We are robots.

01:19:09.828 --> 01:19:12.539
Let me tell you a story.

01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:17.169
Getting into college sucks.

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:20.338
Well, I shouldn't say that
because I haven't gotten in yet.

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:26.928
But I've spent the last 18 years
researching, writing, and debating

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:29.306
both sides of every argument.

01:19:29.389 --> 01:19:34.519
I can speak at 400 words per minute
and cram as many facts as humanly possible

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:37.022
into each round
before that buzzer goes off.

01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:41.818
I did everything I thought
I needed to do, and...

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.280
what happened?

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:54.331
It resulted in a big fat rejection letter.

01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:59.085
Facts over feelings, right?

01:20:00.253 --> 01:20:01.588
Is that a good idea?

01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:06.134
I'm at a loss.

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:09.930
I am.

01:20:10.013 --> 01:20:13.809
Because maybe I will be a politician
or a lawyer someday

01:20:13.892 --> 01:20:15.560
and these Saturdays
will have provided me

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:19.523
with some skill set that I could not
attain anywhere else, but...

01:20:22.567 --> 01:20:23.944
what if I'm unable to...

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:35.372
What if I'm unable
to form a human connection?

01:21:02.816 --> 01:21:04.752
Raise your hand
if you can articulate the arguments

01:21:04.776 --> 01:21:06.903
that Lona and I have been arguing today.

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:19.249
Now raise your hand if you can understand
what Jasmine and Dana have been saying.

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:30.719
They've been doing this all year,
just like us.

01:21:32.512 --> 01:21:33.722
But they're nothing like us.

01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:38.852
Because they didn't choose to focus
on the pressure to win that we did.

01:21:39.603 --> 01:21:41.323
Instead they chose
something more important,

01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:43.607
communicating.

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:48.194
Next year scares the shit out of me.

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:51.795
I don't know where I'll end up,

01:21:51.865 --> 01:21:55.785
or what I'm going to do,
or what I'll become.

01:21:56.953 --> 01:21:58.413
But as of right now...

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:00.665
I'm happy to be here.

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:04.002
And maybe it was all worth it,

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:08.048
just to see you two come in here
and free the robots.

01:22:11.801 --> 01:22:14.179
So that we would stop
talking at each other,

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.348
and start talking to each other.

01:22:33.865 --> 01:22:34.865
Thanks.

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:05.939
Thank you, everyone. This is it.

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:09.985
In a 2-1 decision,

01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:12.237
your state champions,

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:16.908
from Washington High,
Jasmine Spencer and Dana Martinez.

01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:25.542
Sometimes we lose.

01:23:42.767 --> 01:23:45.979
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Debate Club.

01:23:46.062 --> 01:23:51.359
The first rule of Debate Club is,
you do not talk about Debate Club.

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:56.865
The second rule of Debate Club is,
you do not talk about Debate Club.

01:23:56.948 --> 01:23:59.784
The third rule is,
if someone yells "stop",

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:03.246
goes limp, or tags out,
the debate is over.

01:24:03.329 --> 01:24:05.165
- Brad Pitt.
- In Fight Club.

01:24:05.248 --> 01:24:07.709
Thank you, Taylor and Tanner.

01:24:07.792 --> 01:24:08.877
Once more from the top.

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:13.673
The first rule of Debate Club is,
you do not talk about Debate Club.

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:39.616
I can feel you watching me, Mom.

01:24:39.699 --> 01:24:41.910
Sorry for being excited for you.

01:24:41.993 --> 01:24:45.830
- It's just another dance.
- It's your last dance.

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:46.914
It's prom.

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:51.252
I know you've been all grown up
ever since I gave birth to you,

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:53.922
but I hate to tell you this,

01:24:54.005 --> 01:24:57.383
life after high school
is just a series of disappointments.

01:24:57.467 --> 01:24:59.803
You always know just what to say.

01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:01.888
'Cause I love you.

01:25:01.971 --> 01:25:04.724
I love you, too.
Now let me finish getting ready, please.

01:25:10.188 --> 01:25:12.816
The day has arrived

01:25:12.899 --> 01:25:14.734
Fresh off the ironing board.

01:25:16.319 --> 01:25:19.197
Oh, my gosh. Let me take a look at you.

01:25:22.992 --> 01:25:24.452
Take pictures, okay?

01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:27.497
- For you or your campaign?
- Hey.

01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:29.624
Very funny. For you.

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:35.255
This is one of those life moments, right?

01:25:35.338 --> 01:25:38.550
You're going to college for four years,
and two years of law school,

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:40.914
and then you're gonna be working
14-hour days in your 20s,

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.220
so you really just got...

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:44.264
Relax.

01:25:44.347 --> 01:25:45.347
Relax.

01:25:45.765 --> 01:25:46.765
Exactly.

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:48.226
Uh...

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:49.328
You want me to call a limo?

01:25:49.352 --> 01:25:50.704
- Then you can have a driver.
- No.

01:25:50.728 --> 01:25:52.540
- You could stay out all night.
- I don't need a limo.

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:54.649
I have a car that works.

01:25:55.233 --> 01:25:56.233
I know.

01:25:57.861 --> 01:25:59.362
I'll be home by midnight.

01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:03.324
One o'clock is fine.

01:26:04.784 --> 01:26:05.784
12:30.

01:26:32.353 --> 01:26:33.354
Here you go.

01:26:34.814 --> 01:26:36.399
And congratulations.

01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:40.528
You look good in red.

01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:42.280
- It's crimson.
- Oh, shut up.

01:26:42.947 --> 01:26:44.267
Congratulations to you.

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:46.409
I always thought
you were a bit of a Bulldog.

01:26:46.492 --> 01:26:48.203
I didn't even know what their mascot was.

01:26:48.286 --> 01:26:50.830
You're gonna go
to so many football games.

01:26:50.914 --> 01:26:52.749
And so many parties.

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:55.710
Nah, not really.

01:26:56.753 --> 01:26:58.338
One popcorn, one soda.

01:26:58.421 --> 01:27:02.300
And during this evening's performance
will you be enjoying some candy?

01:27:03.426 --> 01:27:08.056
Yes. We will have
some Reese's Pieces, please.

01:27:08.139 --> 01:27:09.390
- And Milk Duds.
- And Whoppers.

01:27:09.474 --> 01:27:11.809
- And let me get a KitKat.
- And Twizzlers.

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:14.646
- Let me get the Good and Plenty.
- And some Jolly Ranchers as well.

01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:16.606
And that Mr. Goodbar.

01:27:19.108 --> 01:27:20.108
Wait for it.

01:27:24.864 --> 01:27:26.991
No. I am not eating
out of that sweaty hat

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:28.451
that's been on your sweaty head.

01:27:28.534 --> 01:27:29.619
My head is not sweaty.

01:27:29.702 --> 01:27:31.788
Your head is sweaty, and so is your hat.

01:27:31.871 --> 01:27:34.916
- And now our candy is contaminated.
- Contaminated?

01:27:34.999 --> 01:27:37.460
Absolutely,
at least on a microscopic level.

01:27:37.543 --> 01:27:40.338
So by that rationale
we should never hold hands.

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:42.131
You don't want that.

01:27:43.383 --> 01:27:45.301
No. You don't want that.

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:48.429
Look at him.

01:27:49.013 --> 01:27:52.016
Look at that smug look on his smug face.

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.518
He thinks that we're a couple.

01:27:55.061 --> 01:27:57.146
He thinks we have a thing going.

01:27:57.230 --> 01:28:00.733
He has no sense that in just a few months
we'll go our separate ways,

01:28:00.817 --> 01:28:02.902
probably lose contact,
gain the freshman 15,

01:28:02.986 --> 01:28:05.530
and jump head first back into studying.

01:28:05.613 --> 01:28:09.409
He thinks I actually like him.
Don't you, Bennett Russell?

01:28:09.993 --> 01:28:11.327
You think I like you?

01:28:13.538 --> 01:28:14.539
Well, damn it.

01:28:15.915 --> 01:28:17.041
You might be right.

01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:21.087
- Mm?
- Mm-hm.

01:28:21.170 --> 01:28:23.756
- Yeah, I know. It's awesome.
- You want some?

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.091
I actually do want some.

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:27.343
Shut up.

01:28:27.427 --> 01:28:29.095
Oh.
