05:08.174 --> 05:10.665
One female in her late thirties
and three minors,

05:10.777 --> 05:13.473
Multiple stab wounds
and blunt-force trauma,

05:13.579 --> 05:17.310
What about the ex-husband? Court said
the wife had a restraining order against him,

05:17.417 --> 05:20.750
Dylan Bennet. He spent the night
with a bottle of Jack Daniel's.

05:20.853 --> 05:23.686
-It was his first Christmas without his family,
-All the more reason,

05:23.790 --> 05:25.655
Well, you didn't see him
when he ID-ed his family,

05:25.758 --> 05:27.419
Looked like he'd been hit by a freight train,

05:27.527 --> 05:31.657
Seeing his kids like that, All the blood,
Yeah, it was definitely a nightmare for him,

05:31.764 --> 05:35.427
If this guy did it, he gets my vote
for a goddamn Academy Award,

05:35.535 --> 05:38.197
Let's say the stepfather,
this Grady Edwards did it.

05:38.304 --> 05:40.101
-What do we got on him?
-Nothing.

05:40.206 --> 05:41.400
Said he was from Kansas.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.475
Except we can't find a match
in any database,

05:43.576 --> 05:45.874
And he stopped the newspaper
to have time to disappear,

05:45.978 --> 05:48.139
And we think
he might have done this before.

05:48.247 --> 05:51.216
Three years ago in New Jersey,
a wife and three kids,

05:51.317 --> 05:54.878
Gunshot wounds to the back of the head,
The stepfather disappeared,

05:55.321 --> 05:57.289
Lived in a rented room
where he met the victims,

05:57.390 --> 05:59.551
Both rooms were owned by older women,

05:59.659 --> 06:01.559
One of the women
who lives in New Jersey said,

06:01.661 --> 06:05.028
"He's a wonderful man,
always paid his rent on time and in cash, "

06:05.131 --> 06:07.429
So, of course,
she never asked him for any identification,

06:07.533 --> 06:10.559
No, he's smart, The Toyota Land Cruiser
that we found abandoned?

06:10.670 --> 06:13.969
Paid for in cash,
No driver's license required for registration,

06:14.073 --> 06:16.735
No credit cards, no anything, Which means,,,

06:16.843 --> 06:20.609
-No photo ID required,
-Always a divorced or widowed situation,

06:20.713 --> 06:23.375
I'm telling you, this guy's a monster.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.979
Even if this is your guy,

06:29.088 --> 06:32.114
it's been six months,
He could be anywhere by now,

06:42.201 --> 06:44.192
Mom, Beth says I can't get these.

06:44.303 --> 06:45.998
-Sean, we're not getting these.
-Hey! You two stop arguing.

06:46.105 --> 06:48.972
Why does she always get to pick
the kind of cookies we get? It's not fair!

06:49.075 --> 06:52.977
Life is not fair. Life is about the woman
getting to pick the cookies.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.347
Sorry, they get
a little out of control sometimes.

06:56.449 --> 06:58.314
They're just kids.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.854
But the sooner you figure out the cookie
deal, the easier your life's gonna be.

07:01.954 --> 07:03.353
I'm just saying.

07:03.456 --> 07:06.857
It's a woman's world
and we're just guests here.

07:06.959 --> 07:09.359
Wise man. I'd say your wife is very lucky.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.454
I'm not married anymore.

07:12.565 --> 07:17.059
I still wear it, but I lost my wife
and daughter in an accident last year.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.071
-Drunk driver.
-God, I'm so sorry.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.231
It's okay.

07:22.542 --> 07:25.170
-I could use a little help, though.
-Sure.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.575
Where is the peanut butter?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.978
I just moved to Portland
and I don't know this store yet.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.845
-It's actually two aisles over.
-This way? Thank you.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.319
You're so welcome.

07:37.023 --> 07:38.615
Remember what I told you.

07:45.932 --> 07:46.956
What?

08:11.757 --> 08:14.419
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were following me.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.150
No. Hey.

08:19.699 --> 08:25.296
I'm not usually this forward,
but I'm recently divorced and...

08:27.807 --> 08:30.935
I'm taking my kids for pizza,
so I thought maybe you might want to go.

08:31.043 --> 08:32.032
-Pizza?
-The truth is,

08:32.144 --> 08:34.703
I'm just dying for some adult conversation.

08:34.813 --> 08:36.714
Well, I'm not usually this easy.

08:38.116 --> 08:39.311
David Harris.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.145
Susan. Susan Harding.

08:42.421 --> 08:45.390
-It's very nice to meet you.
-It's nice to meet you.

08:58.804 --> 09:00.465
I still can't believe she didn't come
to the airport.

09:00.573 --> 09:02.200
I told you, she had some things to do.

09:05.244 --> 09:07.144
-A little help here.
-Yeah.

09:10.816 --> 09:12.681
At least you have me.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.317
So, have you met this guy?

09:18.424 --> 09:21.518
Yeah, a couple of times. You know,
when I came by to say hi to your mom.

09:21.627 --> 09:23.822
-He seems cool.
-Okay, but she's only known him since,

09:23.930 --> 09:26.694
-what, like, after Christmas? That's so fast.
-Well...

09:27.033 --> 09:30.628
Come on, give it a chance. You know?
Before you do something stupid.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.933
-Like what?
-I don't know. Like,

09:34.040 --> 09:36.304
irritating your mom
and getting sent back to military school.

09:36.409 --> 09:40.778
I'm just saying, it seems like
she's rushing into things. Don't you think?

09:40.880 --> 09:43.110
I think it's her business what she does
with her personal life.

09:43.215 --> 09:44.978
And she tends to screw that up, mostly.

09:45.084 --> 09:48.781
Come on, Michael, chill on this one, please?
No fights with your mom.

09:48.888 --> 09:51.015
-Okay.
-Okay. I got something to show you.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.089
Surprise!

09:58.197 --> 10:01.360
Well, this is a surprise. This is a surprise.
Thank you.

10:01.734 --> 10:04.965
-I'm so happy to have you home.
-Hey, Michael. What's up?

10:05.071 --> 10:08.939
-Hey. Sean. Holy crap, you're huge.
-Thanks.

10:09.041 --> 10:12.533
-I missed you. Come here.
-Beth. I missed you, too.

10:12.645 --> 10:14.408
-Welcome home.
-Hey, Aunt Jackie.

10:14.513 --> 10:16.845
-Leah, hey.
-Hi, sweetie.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.918
Let me look at you.
Your hair's gotten longer.

10:20.019 --> 10:22.954
-Yeah. They ease up on you after a year.
-You look so...

10:23.055 --> 10:26.547
So much like a man. I was expecting a boy.

10:27.259 --> 10:32.219
That's what the military does. Builds men.
Good, strong men.

10:32.331 --> 10:34.526
Michael, this is David. David, Michael.

10:38.771 --> 10:41.262
-ls that a regulation cut?
-No.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.706
It wasn't real military.
It was just a school for screwups.

10:44.910 --> 10:49.176
Well, good to finally meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

10:59.725 --> 11:01.659
Everything seems to be going great.

11:01.761 --> 11:04.457
-Sean and Beth love him.
-What's not to love?

11:04.563 --> 11:07.999
-Yeah, he's almost too good to be true.
-Don't start, Jackie.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.625
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I like him.

11:11.037 --> 11:14.564
Do you think I'm crazy to be engaged
to someone I've only known for six months?

11:14.674 --> 11:17.234
You've always been crazy.
That has nothing to do with him.

11:18.077 --> 11:20.841
He seems a little crazy, too, about you.

11:20.946 --> 11:23.346
-Everyone have enough to eat?
-Yeah...

11:23.449 --> 11:27.283
I would like to propose a toast.

11:28.254 --> 11:31.690
First of all, I want to thank
Susan and Sean and Beth,

11:31.791 --> 11:36.353
who, in a very short time, have taken me in
and made me feel at home.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.831
This is... It's a dream come true for me.

11:40.966 --> 11:42.263
Thank you.

11:42.401 --> 11:47.566
And to Michael.
Your return makes us complete.

11:48.708 --> 11:52.542
Family is the most important thing.
Without it, we have nothing.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.176
-Welcome home, Michael.
-Hear, hear.

11:55.514 --> 11:57.414
Hear, hear, Michael.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.984
I think I'm a little nauseous after that.

12:00.186 --> 12:01.380
Stop it.

12:02.922 --> 12:05.823
-You want something to drink?
-No, no, no, I got this.

12:06.325 --> 12:08.589
We have a surprise for you, too.

12:08.694 --> 12:10.753
-Really?
-Jackie pulled a few strings

12:10.863 --> 12:14.230
and she can get you a job
working with her as a real estate agent.

12:14.333 --> 12:17.393
-I couldn't.
-Wait a minute. Of course you can.

12:17.503 --> 12:20.233
Okay? Just follow me around
and I'll get you all set up.

12:20.339 --> 12:23.240
It's a great opportunity for us
and she really went out of her way.

12:23.342 --> 12:28.143
Well, I can't say no to my bride-to-be
or her sister, can l?

12:28.247 --> 12:30.181
-Thank you, Jackie.
-Don't thank me. Thank her.

12:30.282 --> 12:32.580
Because she's the one who convinced me
to get you off the road

12:32.685 --> 12:35.950
-so she can keep an eye on you.
-Did you?

12:39.959 --> 12:43.224
Thank you.
I'm gonna go have a word with your son.

12:44.463 --> 12:46.863
God, I hope Michael takes to him.

12:46.966 --> 12:50.925
He will.
He's just been blindsided by the divorce.

12:51.036 --> 12:52.503
He'll bounce back.

12:52.872 --> 12:56.467
Michael. Give me four minutes.
Meet me in the basement.

13:00.146 --> 13:03.377
So, what'd he say?

13:04.016 --> 13:05.711
He said he wants me
to meet him in the basement.

13:05.818 --> 13:07.683
-ln the basement?
-Yeah.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.545
Why?

13:09.655 --> 13:11.680
I don't know.
Well, I guess I'm about to find out.

13:51.197 --> 13:54.724
Those two are mine.
But you're welcome to use the others.

13:56.268 --> 13:57.758
What's all this for?

13:57.870 --> 14:01.067
Well, I'm a bit of a wannabe carpenter.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.198
I built these storage cabinets myself.

14:03.709 --> 14:07.076
And I'm working up in the attic right now
on some termite damage.

14:07.913 --> 14:10.143
I think we need a real toast.

14:10.249 --> 14:11.841
Just the guys.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.245
This is where I keep the good stuff.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.115
There we go.

14:20.926 --> 14:24.020
Now, don't let your mom know
I've got a tequila stash.

14:24.697 --> 14:28.326
I've worked my ass off
trying to convince her I'm perfect.

14:28.434 --> 14:32.393
I know this must be a bit of a shock,
your mom and me getting married and all,

14:33.706 --> 14:36.539
but I want you to know, I want us

14:37.610 --> 14:38.975
to be a real family.

14:39.645 --> 14:41.510
Because without it, we have nothing?

14:43.515 --> 14:45.312
Okay. Touché.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.911
So I get a little corny sometimes,
but I meant what I said.

14:49.021 --> 14:51.012
You just let me handle your mother,

14:51.123 --> 14:54.092
and I'm gonna make sure you stay right here,
where you belong.

14:54.193 --> 14:56.525
No more military school.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.621
We're gonna put this family back together,
you and me,

14:59.732 --> 15:02.132
-father and son.
-Stepfather.

15:03.202 --> 15:04.464
Stepfather

15:05.738 --> 15:07.035
and son.

15:10.976 --> 15:12.637
That's smooth, isn't it?

15:15.481 --> 15:17.711
So your mother tells me
you're one hell of a swimmer.

15:17.816 --> 15:19.181
Yeah, I do okay.

15:19.285 --> 15:23.244
You know, I used to swim in competition.
In college, at U of O.

15:23.355 --> 15:26.017
Your senior year is gonna be very important.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.457
You could maybe get
a college scholarship swimming.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.822
You should be training this summer.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.556
It's kind of hard to train in a backyard pool.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.462
Maybe. But I hear your old school
has a summer swim program.

15:34.566 --> 15:38.024
It does, but I can't use that pool anymore.

15:39.204 --> 15:40.637
That's the past.

15:42.741 --> 15:44.834
Here is to the future.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.811
Remember, I have to go see
my grandparents tomorrow.

15:49.915 --> 15:52.645
-Yeah, that's right.
-But I'll be back the day after. I'm sorry.

15:52.751 --> 15:56.585
No, that's all right. I mean, it's the day I get
back, but that's fine. I'll call someone else.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.657
Shut up. I'm sorry.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.989
Listen, I want to get my license.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.390
So, can you take me by the DMV?

16:04.763 --> 16:08.529
-Maybe. I'll think about it.
-Why not?

16:08.901 --> 16:11.369
I kind of like having you
dependent on me, actually.

16:11.470 --> 16:12.596
All right, get in the car.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.866
-Good night.
-Good night.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.475
-Good night, Leah.
-Bye.

16:20.512 --> 16:22.377
Glad you're home, Michael.

16:22.681 --> 16:26.777
Thanks, Aunt Jackie. I'm so glad to be home.
Thank you for coming.

16:38.897 --> 16:41.798
Do you think David meant what he said
about getting your mom to let you stay?

16:41.900 --> 16:45.165
He said he was gonna make it happen,
so we'll see.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.563
Sweet. Bye.

16:51.243 --> 16:52.938
A lot for one day, huh?

16:53.045 --> 16:55.912
No, no, it was... It was nice. Thanks.

16:56.281 --> 16:58.511
I'm trying too hard. You can say it.

17:03.856 --> 17:08.452
Look, Michael, I know it's difficult
to come home to another man in the house.

17:10.061 --> 17:12.326
I just need you to try and get along, okay?

17:12.431 --> 17:16.663
Mom, can we just hold the lectures, please?
I've been home for two seconds.

17:18.337 --> 17:19.702
Okay.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.465
He's a really good guy.

17:22.941 --> 17:25.773
And he cares about me
and we're trying to start a new life together.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.005
-And you don't want me to mess that up.
-Well, that's not fair.

17:28.113 --> 17:30.638
No, no, no, I get it. I'll try not to
inconvenience you and your new life.

17:30.749 --> 17:32.842
-Michael.
-I'm sorry. I...

17:33.786 --> 17:35.310
I'm pretty tired, Mom.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.980
Okay. Okay.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.184
Good night.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.325
Maybe he should stay there his senior year.

17:50.436 --> 17:55.135
-But his place is here with his family.
-Yeah, but you don't know what he was like.

17:55.240 --> 17:59.836
The kids he was hanging out with, the lying.
His temper was out of control.

18:03.882 --> 18:06.442
Believe me, I want him here
more than anything in the world.

18:06.552 --> 18:09.521
I just hope he's ready.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.222
You're right.

18:19.498 --> 18:21.557
Are you ready?

18:21.667 --> 18:23.362
Well, it depends.

18:24.069 --> 18:25.969
Are you ready for it?

19:03.041 --> 19:05.475
-That smells good.
-Hey.

19:05.577 --> 19:09.274
-How was work?
-Work was great. These are for you.

19:11.283 --> 19:13.114
-Thank you.
-Michael.

19:13.952 --> 19:15.943
-What's this?
-Your locker key to the boys' gym

19:16.054 --> 19:17.544
at your old high school.

19:17.656 --> 19:21.683
The swim team starts training
first week in July.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.586
Wait, how did you swing this?

19:25.697 --> 19:28.165
I had a little chat with Mrs. Rivers,
the athletic director,

19:28.267 --> 19:29.461
a very open-minded woman.

19:29.568 --> 19:31.058
David, that was so sweet.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.229
Yeah, that's incredible.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.829
It's just a probationary period for now.

19:35.941 --> 19:40.071
There's no guarantee they'll let you back
in the fall. But we'll work on that later.

19:41.780 --> 19:44.772
-lt means a lot. Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

19:45.717 --> 19:47.150
So, what are we having here?

19:47.252 --> 19:51.279
Okay, I just think it's so cool that he
actually did what he said he was gonna do.

19:51.390 --> 19:52.823
I know. I know.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.984
See, I told you
everything was gonna work out.

19:55.093 --> 19:56.822
Yeah, maybe you're right,

19:56.929 --> 20:00.990
-Hey, we still going to the DMV tomorrow?
-Yeah. I'll be by around 10:00.

20:01.433 --> 20:03.060
-Yeah, that sounds good,
-All right.

20:03.168 --> 20:04.294
-Good night.
-Night,

20:16.882 --> 20:19.373
Hey, Sean, turn that down, please!

20:22.020 --> 20:22.987
Yes!

20:23.255 --> 20:25.849
Sean, turn that down now! I mean it!

20:28.227 --> 20:30.661
Your mother said to turn it down!

20:55.387 --> 20:59.289
Do you think it's a good idea
they're so passionate at their age?

20:59.391 --> 21:01.689
They've known each other
since grade school.

21:01.793 --> 21:04.318
She's a good influence on Michael.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.693
You should stop being so old-fashioned.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.896
I think it's so lucky
that your mom met David.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.563
Why is that?

21:14.673 --> 21:18.541
He is gonna be your ticket
to staying here with me.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.412
Maybe I don't want to stay here with you.

21:21.513 --> 21:24.346
Maybe you want to go back
to an all-boys military school.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.746
Maybe.

21:32.257 --> 21:36.387
-But I like looking at you.
-That's why we make a good couple.

21:36.495 --> 21:38.360
Because I like you looking at me.

21:53.245 --> 21:54.735
You okay, Sean?

21:56.982 --> 21:58.415
Yeah, I'm okay.

21:59.785 --> 22:02.379
-You sure, buddy?
-This is great.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.250
I've missed family dinners like this.

22:04.356 --> 22:07.621
You've missed them?
Does that mean you were married before?

22:07.726 --> 22:10.524
David lost his wife and daughter
in an accident.

22:10.629 --> 22:12.961
Yeah, a drunk driver.

22:15.701 --> 22:19.228
I had no idea. I'm sorry, David. I'm sorry.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.307
I guess that's why
family is so important to me, Michael.

22:22.407 --> 22:24.238
Well, family is important.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.868
We haven't always had
such great experiences as a family.

22:26.978 --> 22:29.845
-Hey, it wasn't all Dad's fault.
-No, I didn't say it was.

22:29.948 --> 22:32.041
But, you know, our family wasn't that bad.

22:32.150 --> 22:35.642
I saw on TV this woman who drove off
a bridge with her three kids in the back seat.

22:35.754 --> 22:38.222
That is so not dinner-table conversation,
young lady.

22:38.323 --> 22:41.486
-They all drowned.
-That kind of thing really gets to me,

22:41.593 --> 22:43.220
that someone could do that
to her own children.

22:43.328 --> 22:44.488
It makes you wonder, though, what it takes

22:44.596 --> 22:45.654
to make someone do something so sick.

22:45.764 --> 22:48.289
-Okay. Can we change the conversation?
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.833
Dad!

22:51.503 --> 22:53.733
Maybe they disappointed her.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.435
Dad!

22:59.544 --> 23:02.012
-Hey, how are you? Let me take this.
-I'm good. Thanks.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.014
-Hey, sweetie.
-Hi, Dad.

23:04.683 --> 23:07.049
-Aren't you gonna say hello to him?
-No.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.418
-Shotgun!
-What?

23:10.522 --> 23:12.683
There's no way you're getting shotgun.

23:12.791 --> 23:16.227
-Hey. Hey, work it out, guys. Work it out.
-Hey.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.625
Back on Sunday. They're going to camp.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.425
-We have a million things to do.
-I know they're going to camp.

23:20.532 --> 23:23.126
I'm only in town a couple days.
I'm taking the kids to a Blazers game.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.897
They can spend the night with me
at the hotel. I'll have them back tomorrow.

23:26.004 --> 23:29.565
-Where's the co-ed girlfriend?
-That's over.

23:30.008 --> 23:33.466
Actually, she was working for a Ph.D. She
wasn't that much younger than you were.

23:33.578 --> 23:37.207
She just took a little better care of herself,
that's all.

23:38.216 --> 23:41.276
-ls Michael home?
-He doesn't want to see you.

23:41.787 --> 23:44.187
-Those his words or yours?
-His.

23:44.890 --> 23:47.381
"Your check is late" are mine.

23:47.759 --> 23:50.523
Just make sure you don't spend any
of the money on my replacement in there.

23:50.629 --> 23:53.723
It's not necessary to replace you, Jay.
You're not missed.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.897
Good to see you, too, Susan.

23:57.969 --> 23:59.334
You guys ready?

24:00.005 --> 24:01.267
Everything okay?

24:02.340 --> 24:04.501
He's just always such an ass.

24:08.013 --> 24:12.609
So, Michael, Jackie has me covering
an open house in the afternoon,

24:12.717 --> 24:14.344
but let's you and me have lunch tomorrow.
What do you say?

24:14.453 --> 24:16.353
That'd be really nice.

24:17.556 --> 24:20.286
-Yeah, that'd be good.
-Great.

24:30.735 --> 24:32.794
Hey, Mrs. Cutter, how are you?

24:32.904 --> 24:34.496
I'm fine, Susan.

24:35.073 --> 24:37.064
There was a police sketch...

24:45.851 --> 24:48.217
I can assure you it's not David.

24:49.754 --> 24:51.949
Don't worry. It's so not him.

24:52.057 --> 24:54.025
Okay. If you see it,
come over and let's talk about it.

24:54.125 --> 24:56.855
-Okay. Thanks, Mrs. Cutter.
-All right.

25:03.602 --> 25:05.069
-You all right?
-Yeah.

25:05.170 --> 25:08.401
That was Mrs. Cutter. She's known
in the neighborhood as "The Cat Lady."

25:08.507 --> 25:11.340
Stopped by with one of her gazillion cats.

25:11.943 --> 25:14.912
-They make my allergies go crazy.
-What'd she want?

25:15.714 --> 25:20.242
Wanted to tell me that she had seen
this story on America's Most Wanted

25:20.352 --> 25:24.083
about this killer and that
the police sketch looked just like you.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.623
It was all I could do not to laugh in her face.

25:26.725 --> 25:28.317
You know Erica Harmon, right?

25:28.426 --> 25:32.055
Okay, so a couple years ago,
she tells Erica Harmon's husband

25:32.163 --> 25:35.894
that Erica is having an affair because
she sees this man sneaking into their house

25:36.001 --> 25:37.969
every morning just after he leaves.

25:38.069 --> 25:40.663
-And was she?
-Well, yeah.

25:40.772 --> 25:42.967
-Well, there you go, then.
-Well, it wasn't any of her business

25:43.074 --> 25:45.736
and she told the entire neighborhood
before she told him.

25:45.844 --> 25:49.280
Great. This'll make me a hit
with the neighbors, huh?

25:50.815 --> 25:52.373
I gotta go.

25:56.755 --> 26:00.282
I think I'd rather be the mystery man
sneaking into Mrs. Harmon's house.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.519
-What's she look like?
-Stop it.

26:03.795 --> 26:06.059
Hey, where are you having lunch?
Because I need to drop Michael off.

26:06.164 --> 26:07.791
There's a diner across from the office

26:07.899 --> 26:10.265
and I'll bring him home
on my way to the open house.

26:10.368 --> 26:11.926
Have a great day.

26:24.482 --> 26:27.508
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, sleepyhead.

26:27.619 --> 26:30.213
-Want something to eat?
-Yes, please.

26:30.789 --> 26:31.949
Okay.

26:33.525 --> 26:36.653
-Where's David?
-You just missed him.

26:39.898 --> 26:41.798
Good morning, Mrs. Cutter.

26:54.312 --> 26:56.405
Okay, anybody got a sweet tooth?

26:56.514 --> 26:57.674
-Do you want dessert?
-No, no.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.114
-You sure? Some more tea? Anything?
-No. No, I'm fine.

27:00.218 --> 27:01.913
-All right. Just the check, please.
-No problem.

27:02.020 --> 27:04.784
-Thank you for lunch, by the way.
-Absolutely. So...

27:06.791 --> 27:09.954
What I really wanted to talk to you
about was...

27:11.663 --> 27:13.096
Well, I need a favor.

27:13.198 --> 27:15.098
Well, what kind of favor?

27:15.200 --> 27:16.997
I'd like you to be my best man.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.233
-Me?
-I'd really be honored if you would.

27:20.338 --> 27:22.397
There's no one else I'd rather have.

27:22.507 --> 27:26.238
I know sometimes I get a little carried away
with the whole family thing,

27:26.344 --> 27:29.745
but, you know, truth is,
I'm really happy you're home.

27:29.848 --> 27:32.078
And like I said,
I'm gonna make sure you stay home

27:32.183 --> 27:34.879
and this family stays complete. Right?

27:35.553 --> 27:37.111
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

27:38.356 --> 27:39.482
So,

27:41.359 --> 27:45.125
-what do you say?
-Well...

27:45.230 --> 27:48.097
I know it would make
your mother very happy.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.763
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

27:50.869 --> 27:52.666
That's great. That is great!

27:54.272 --> 27:56.467
You know, without sounding
too sentimental, I want to tell you,

27:56.574 --> 28:00.203
meeting your mother that day
in the supermarket changed my life.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.437
It was hard, you know,

28:03.581 --> 28:05.947
after what happened
to my wife and daughter.

28:06.051 --> 28:09.714
My little Michelle was my whole world,
my whole life.

28:09.821 --> 28:11.482
Watching her grow up was everything.

28:13.258 --> 28:16.659
You'll understand what I'm talking about
when you have kids of your own.

28:16.761 --> 28:18.991
Not that you and Kelly should be
rushing into anything. Okay?

28:19.097 --> 28:20.826
No, no, no. Don't worry.

28:20.932 --> 28:23.526
You got years to go if you're smart.

28:25.870 --> 28:29.306
When it happens,
I think you'll see what I mean.

28:30.408 --> 28:31.932
They're everything.

28:33.678 --> 28:36.340
Lisa would have turned 11 next week.

28:38.483 --> 28:40.917
-Who's Lisa?
-My daughter.

28:41.686 --> 28:42.914
-Thanks.
-Pleasure.

28:43.021 --> 28:45.216
I'm sorry.
I thought you said her name was Michelle.

28:47.292 --> 28:48.452
Did l?

28:51.296 --> 28:54.561
It's Lisa-Michelle.
You must have heard it wrong.

28:54.866 --> 28:56.026
I'm sorry.

28:56.835 --> 29:00.202
Yeah. 1 1 next week.

29:01.840 --> 29:02.864
Damn it!

29:10.081 --> 29:11.412
Excuse me.

29:12.784 --> 29:13.944
Excuse me!

29:16.721 --> 29:17.847
-Hi!
-Hi!

29:17.956 --> 29:19.082
-Hello, there.
-We're the Baldwins.

29:19.190 --> 29:20.350
We called about the house.

29:20.458 --> 29:23.188
Mrs. Baldwin. Mr. Baldwin.
Good to meet you. I'm David Harris.

29:23.294 --> 29:25.819
-Mrs. Baldwin, do you have any children?
-Three girls.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.830
Three girls? You're gonna love this place.

30:12.177 --> 30:14.202
Stay here. Finish your dinner.

30:18.683 --> 30:20.981
Okay. I'm coming.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.550
All right. Yeah.

30:24.756 --> 30:28.419
Come on. Come on, baby. Come on.

30:29.761 --> 30:32.889
Yeah. Let's see who it is.

31:09.734 --> 31:13.670
Midnight? Midnight?

31:14.973 --> 31:18.841
Where is that cat? Where is he? Midnight?

31:19.210 --> 31:22.373
Where is that Midnight?

31:22.480 --> 31:25.313
Come here. What are you doing?

31:28.119 --> 31:29.984
What's the matter?

32:32.183 --> 32:33.616
So, are you?

32:35.553 --> 32:37.043
Am I what?

32:39.490 --> 32:41.219
Gonna be his best man.

32:45.229 --> 32:47.823
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. I said yes, so...

32:49.600 --> 32:50.794
What?

32:53.604 --> 32:57.370
I'm about to get another father.

32:58.142 --> 33:01.339
You know,
and I can't talk to the one I have now.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.512
Well, maybe you should start.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.139
What's wrong?

33:36.247 --> 33:39.410
-Didn't you close your door?
-Yeah.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.986
Beth? Is that you?

33:45.523 --> 33:48.185
Sean? Sean?

33:49.394 --> 33:51.157
No, there's no one here.

33:52.296 --> 33:53.263
What?

33:53.998 --> 33:55.625
Jesus, David.

33:56.234 --> 33:57.929
Hey, come on. Where you going?

34:00.705 --> 34:02.002
-I better go home.
-You don't have to leave.

34:02.106 --> 34:03.073
No, it's okay.

34:04.142 --> 34:06.303
Were you just watching us?

34:06.444 --> 34:09.072
Doing what? I just got home from work.

34:09.847 --> 34:13.010
I'm gonna take a shower
and get ready for dinner.

34:17.388 --> 34:19.481
You and Kelly have been together
for a long time.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.888
All I'm saying is,
I just want you to be careful.

34:21.993 --> 34:24.359
She seems like a very nice young woman.

34:24.462 --> 34:27.295
Which is why a young man should be
more discreet with his affections.

34:27.398 --> 34:30.799
-Meaning what? What does that mean?
-People might get the wrong idea about her.

34:30.902 --> 34:31.891
You wouldn't want that, now, would you?

34:32.003 --> 34:33.368
What do you suppose people think
about you

34:33.471 --> 34:35.666
-moving in with my mother?
-Michael.

34:36.274 --> 34:38.400
Excuse me. Apologize.

34:39.010 --> 34:40.841
-No. For what?
-Being disrespectful.

34:40.945 --> 34:44.880
It's okay. It's okay. It's healthy to have
open family dialogue, right?

34:44.982 --> 34:46.108
Yeah.

34:49.853 --> 34:51.844
How was your day?

34:52.056 --> 34:53.181
It was busy.

34:56.127 --> 34:58.186
Was Mrs. Cutter here today?

34:58.296 --> 35:01.788
No. It's probably from the house
I was showing. They have cats and...

35:02.733 --> 35:03.893
Sean. Beth...

35:04.001 --> 35:08.335
Hey. If you ever lay a hand on one of my kids
again, it'll be the last thing you ever do!

35:08.439 --> 35:09.667
What are you talking about?

35:09.774 --> 35:12.174
-This bastard tried to choke Sean.
-I didn't choke anybody.

35:12.276 --> 35:14.267
Sean says you put your hand
around his neck and it hurt.

35:14.378 --> 35:17.245
His mother told him to turn down his video
game and he wasn't listening to her.

35:17.348 --> 35:19.145
I was just trying to show him
a little discipline.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.184
From what I've seen,
that's lacking a bit in this family.

35:21.285 --> 35:22.946
If you ever touch my family again,

35:23.054 --> 35:24.851
-I will kill you! I swear to God!
-Stop it.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.787
-Come on...
-This is not your family anymore, Jay.

35:26.891 --> 35:28.222
-What do you even know about this guy?
-Stop.

35:28.326 --> 35:29.350
-What do you know about him?
-Stop it!

35:29.460 --> 35:30.620
I know he's not sleeping with his secretary!

35:30.728 --> 35:31.854
You don't know a goddamn thing!

35:31.963 --> 35:34.193
-I'll call the police if you don't leave!
-Not a goddamn thing!

35:34.298 --> 35:36.266
You heard what I said.
You touch my kids again,

35:36.367 --> 35:38.358
you got some big trouble coming.

35:41.072 --> 35:42.403
Oh, my God.

35:43.307 --> 35:44.672
I'm so sorry.

35:44.775 --> 35:46.640
It's okay. Come here.

35:46.744 --> 35:48.234
I'm so sorry.

35:49.013 --> 35:51.846
He had no goddamn right grabbing Sean
like that. No goddamn right!

35:51.949 --> 35:55.510
You can't do this anymore! Come on.
Calm down, please.

35:58.055 --> 35:59.420
Dad, here.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.150
You dropped this. It fell out of your pocket
when you were going at it.

36:05.863 --> 36:06.955
Thanks.

36:11.869 --> 36:13.598
You stopped me from doing
something really dumb in there.

36:13.704 --> 36:15.569
Yeah, I probably did.

36:16.874 --> 36:18.341
I don't like this guy.

36:18.976 --> 36:21.444
I don't trust him.
I mean, what do you know about this guy?

36:21.546 --> 36:23.138
Not any more than you, really.

36:27.585 --> 36:28.882
You got taller.

36:31.722 --> 36:34.714
Yeah, well, you know, it's been a year.

36:35.393 --> 36:36.519
Hey, hey, come on.

36:36.627 --> 36:39.425
-Talk to me for a second, will you?
-What do you want?

36:41.065 --> 36:44.557
I don't know. I want to talk to you.
Your mom says you don't want to see me.

36:44.669 --> 36:46.136
Is that true?

36:49.941 --> 36:52.876
I don't know, Dad.
You know, I'm not the one who left.

36:53.544 --> 36:55.444
I left your mom. I didn't leave you.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.412
You kids are the most important thing
in the world to me.

36:58.516 --> 37:00.245
Well, yeah, yeah, you have a funny way
of showing that.

37:00.351 --> 37:04.617
Hey, I know. I screwed up. I feel really bad
about that, but I'd like to make it up to you.

37:06.324 --> 37:08.792
What, you're not gonna see me?
You're not gonna talk to me?

37:08.893 --> 37:09.825
No.

37:11.362 --> 37:12.920
Are you okay, Sean?

37:13.698 --> 37:14.824
Yeah.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.902
I guess I shouldn't have told Dad.

37:19.537 --> 37:21.505
-Well, what...
-No, it wasn't your fault, Sean.

37:25.176 --> 37:28.703
I shouldn't have done what I did.
It wasn't right.

37:31.482 --> 37:33.040
I'm not your father.

37:33.150 --> 37:35.983
Maybe someday, but...

37:37.588 --> 37:41.046
This is all new to me again.
I'm gonna make mistakes.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.827
And I just hope
you can forgive me when I do.

37:46.964 --> 37:48.261
Can you do that?

37:49.700 --> 37:51.133
I promise,

37:51.969 --> 37:54.301
it'll never happen again, okay?

37:56.407 --> 37:57.601
Friends?

38:00.878 --> 38:03.972
-Friends.
-Yeah. All right.

38:33.678 --> 38:35.202
I shouldn't have done it.

38:36.414 --> 38:37.847
It's just that

38:38.249 --> 38:43.084
I see a family without a father and I know
how easy it can all fall apart.

38:47.725 --> 38:50.751
If I'm ever gonna be a part of you,
I need to gain their respect.

38:50.861 --> 38:52.761
And trust.

38:52.863 --> 38:56.526
I don't know how you were raised, David,
but my family never used physical force.

38:56.634 --> 38:58.568
It's not okay with me.

39:00.237 --> 39:01.329
Sure.

39:02.073 --> 39:03.540
You're right.

39:35.906 --> 39:42.368
I can't keep...
I can't... I can't... I got to make this work...

39:53.991 --> 39:56.050
It's all right. It's all right.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.458
I'll tell her I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just...

40:41.405 --> 40:42.372
Thanks.

40:44.642 --> 40:47.167
-David.
-Yes. Something wrong?

40:47.478 --> 40:50.003
No. No, in fact, everything's great.

40:50.114 --> 40:53.550
Your enthusiasm with the buyers
at the Reeves' open house made the sale.

40:53.651 --> 40:54.811
Great.

40:55.319 --> 40:57.116
-We need these filled out.
-What are they?

40:57.221 --> 41:00.190
Social Security, payroll insurance,
workman's comp.

41:00.291 --> 41:04.091
And we need a picture lD. Personnel said
that they gave you the forms to fill out,

41:04.195 --> 41:07.221
-but they just never got them back.
-No, no, I never got anything.

41:07.331 --> 41:09.196
Don't worry about it. We need them, though,

41:09.300 --> 41:11.860
so we don't have to keep paying you
under the table.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.369
-I'll get all this done right away.
-Great.

41:20.945 --> 41:24.039
It just wasn't something
I enjoyed doing, that's all.

41:24.148 --> 41:28.949
Well, I don't understand,
because Jackie said you were a natural.

41:29.053 --> 41:30.611
Real estate is just not me.

41:30.721 --> 41:33.281
Well, what does that mean?
That you want to go back on the road again?

41:33.390 --> 41:36.518
-I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.
-No, wait. I...

41:37.495 --> 41:41.522
I thought you enjoyed family.
I mean, dinners like...

41:41.632 --> 41:45.864
I know how much you hate me being gone,
but it's what I know best.

41:49.540 --> 41:52.031
Let me get on your computer
and look around.

41:52.142 --> 41:55.873
Maybe I can find something
that doesn't require much travel.

42:04.622 --> 42:07.682
-Dude, you better turn it down.
-Are you worried about David?

42:07.791 --> 42:10.487
He's not gonna touch you, all right?
I'll make sure.

42:13.931 --> 42:15.455
I'm just useless.

42:15.799 --> 42:20.099
Hey. I'm walking out the door right now.
Okay, see you.

42:24.341 --> 42:25.467
How's it going?

42:26.076 --> 42:27.475
Couple of things down in Eugene.

42:27.578 --> 42:31.275
Okay, well, I'm gonna go meet Jackie
and Leah for a drink and plan the wedding.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.714
-Would you like to come?
-I don't think so.

42:33.817 --> 42:35.478
When I'm done with this,
I'm gonna go for a run.

42:35.586 --> 42:36.678
Okay.

42:43.861 --> 42:45.055
David...

42:46.463 --> 42:48.727
I didn't mean to make such a fuss
about your work and all.

42:48.832 --> 42:51.027
I don't want you to do anything
you don't want to do.

42:53.137 --> 42:54.195
I

42:56.574 --> 42:58.974
want you to be as happy as I am.

43:00.911 --> 43:02.208
Have fun.

43:40.484 --> 43:42.315
-Susan's not here.
-How about the kids?

43:42.419 --> 43:45.388
Beth's at a friend's. Sean and Michael
are upstairs playing video games.

43:47.124 --> 43:48.148
Look...

43:49.927 --> 43:51.827
I'm sorry about the other night.

43:51.929 --> 43:55.262
I made an ass out of myself.
It's just when Susan and I fight...

44:01.538 --> 44:05.975
I was headed to the airport.
I wanted to say goodbye to the kids and...

44:07.077 --> 44:10.012
Well, I'd like to apologize to you

44:10.114 --> 44:11.604
for being a jerk.

44:14.718 --> 44:17.949
Apology accepted.
Come on in and say goodbye.

44:23.594 --> 44:26.791
Hey, Michael tells me you used to swim
for the Ducks?

44:26.897 --> 44:28.023
A long time ago.

44:28.132 --> 44:29.827
-Yeah? What year?
-'92.

44:29.933 --> 44:33.164
Really? I went to U of O myself.

44:34.905 --> 44:38.363
-I got to grab that. Excuse me.
-Sure. Sure.

44:44.581 --> 44:45.809
-Hello.
-Hey.

44:45.916 --> 44:48.043
Jay had left a message on my cell phone

44:48.152 --> 44:50.916
saying he was gonna stop by there
to say goodbye to the kids.

44:51.021 --> 44:54.479
-Did he come yet?
-No. Not yet.

44:54.591 --> 44:57.651
Okay, well, if he does,
will you just stay out of the way?

44:58.962 --> 45:01.590
All right. I'll see you later then.

45:05.335 --> 45:07.667
Hey, you want to hear something funny?

45:07.771 --> 45:09.534
I called the alumni office

45:09.640 --> 45:12.905
and they told me they only had four guys
named David Harris

45:13.010 --> 45:15.240
graduate in the last 30 years.

45:15.879 --> 45:19.076
And two of them are dead
and one graduated in '87.

45:19.483 --> 45:22.850
And the other one was that
All-American running back.

45:22.953 --> 45:24.250
You remember him?

45:25.189 --> 45:29.091
Of course, he's a little darker than you are,
wouldn't you say?

45:30.060 --> 45:31.254
So...

45:32.930 --> 45:35.694
It's just...
It seems like you might have lied to Michael

45:35.799 --> 45:38.165
about college and swimming.

45:39.269 --> 45:42.204
And now it's got me wondering

45:42.306 --> 45:45.537
just, you know,
what else you might've lied about.

45:58.489 --> 46:01.253
Hey, look, I told Michael
that I would do some checking on you

46:01.358 --> 46:03.883
and, to be honest, I'd like some answers.

46:06.897 --> 46:09.092
Hey. You hear me?

46:10.234 --> 46:11.326
Yep.

46:19.443 --> 46:22.071
-What?
-I heard something.

46:34.858 --> 46:36.655
What was it?

46:36.760 --> 46:38.955
I don't know. It's nothing.

46:44.034 --> 46:46.002
I don't understand.
I'm kind of confused, because...

46:46.103 --> 46:47.365
About?

46:47.471 --> 46:49.598
Well, the feedback
from the buyers was great.

46:49.706 --> 46:53.472
He just felt that it wasn't
what he thought it was gonna be.

46:53.577 --> 46:54.669
You're okay with him on the road?

46:54.778 --> 46:58.179
He's gonna try to find something
where he doesn't have to travel that much.

46:58.816 --> 47:03.048
And I just want him to be happy.
If he's happy, I'm happy.

47:03.587 --> 47:06.249
There you go. I just want to get his bags.

47:09.026 --> 47:11.324
-Pop the trunk?
-You got it.

47:49.299 --> 47:51.597
This is Jay Harding, Leave a message,

47:51.702 --> 47:53.567
Hey, Dad. It's me.

47:55.572 --> 47:58.632
Where are you? Call me. Bye.

48:20.931 --> 48:22.159
David!

48:23.934 --> 48:25.196
Yeah, what do you need, Michael?

48:33.243 --> 48:34.471
Nothing.

48:42.586 --> 48:45.646
You know when you asked me
at Michael's party

48:45.756 --> 48:47.883
if I thought you were rushing into things?

48:49.426 --> 48:51.155
I'm thinking now that maybe you are.

48:51.762 --> 48:54.424
I mean, how much
do you really know about David?

48:54.531 --> 49:00.197
The same day that I ask him for details
about his past, he just up and quits.

49:00.304 --> 49:03.364
-You don't find that strange?
-No, I don't.

49:06.143 --> 49:09.670
You know what I want to do?
I want to go to Vegas

49:09.780 --> 49:13.079
-and have one of those 10-minute weddings.
-Nice.

49:14.051 --> 49:16.349
David wants to have a church wedding.

49:16.453 --> 49:19.911
That's great. What church? I mean,
do you even know what religion he is?

49:20.457 --> 49:22.322
I don't care what goddamn religion he is.

49:25.662 --> 49:29.689
Okay, you're starting to sound just like Jay.

49:29.800 --> 49:33.361
He's accused me of not knowing anything
about David. You know what I do know?

49:33.470 --> 49:35.233
David has been good to me.

49:35.339 --> 49:38.035
He's good to the kids. They love him.

49:38.675 --> 49:41.906
He's made my life worth living again.
I mean, l...

49:42.946 --> 49:44.607
For the first time in a long time,

49:44.715 --> 49:47.183
I'm looking forward
to the future with a smile.

49:47.284 --> 49:53.280
I just wish everybody would be
happy for me. Is that too much to ask?

49:54.858 --> 49:56.189
No, it's not.

49:56.293 --> 49:59.820
Personally, I'm with you. Hey,
I'd have my teeth cleaned in Vegas if I could.

50:00.564 --> 50:01.861
Right?

50:02.499 --> 50:06.458
-Go! Go! Go! Watch it! Wow!
-I just missed that car.

50:06.570 --> 50:07.969
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

50:08.071 --> 50:09.834
-Hey, Mom.
-How'd it go with Jackie and Leah?

50:09.940 --> 50:13.103
We decided we should go to Vegas.

50:14.378 --> 50:16.972
-I'll be right back.
-Where's Michael?

50:18.048 --> 50:19.538
He's in his room.

50:19.649 --> 50:22.618
I think he's a little upset
that his father never showed.

50:24.454 --> 50:26.422
That is so typical of Jay.

50:29.092 --> 50:30.582
-Honey?
-Yeah.

50:30.994 --> 50:33.326
I have a confession to make.

50:35.232 --> 50:39.566
I accidentally broke the crystal vase
that was in the living room.

50:46.410 --> 50:47.843
That's okay.

50:47.944 --> 50:51.107
It was a wedding gift from Jay's sister.
I never liked it anyway.

50:51.214 --> 50:52.875
You didn't?

50:52.983 --> 50:55.611
-Or her.
-Then I don't feel so bad.

51:02.159 --> 51:04.184
You don't think it's a little weird

51:04.294 --> 51:07.320
that I ask for some background information,
and suddenly,

51:07.431 --> 51:09.296
he doesn't want to sell real estate anymore?

51:09.399 --> 51:11.333
Not necessarily.

51:11.435 --> 51:13.835
I like David. He's a gentleman.

51:13.937 --> 51:16.497
He always picks up the tab.
Jay was so cheap.

51:16.606 --> 51:20.667
Do you know what I do think is weird,
though? He always pays in cash.

51:20.777 --> 51:22.870
Who doesn't want the miles?

51:30.020 --> 51:33.478
You know, I never thought
I would ever say this,

51:35.058 --> 51:37.618
but I think I'm gonna give Jay a call.

51:37.727 --> 51:42.755
I mean, if he's not buying this either,
then maybe it's worth checking into.

51:48.705 --> 51:51.196
Hey. He didn't show up?

51:52.809 --> 51:53.935
No.

51:55.846 --> 51:57.313
I'm so sorry.

51:57.414 --> 51:59.848
-That's okay.
-No, it's not okay.

51:59.950 --> 52:02.510
He's never been there for you
like a father should be.

52:02.619 --> 52:03.745
And part of that's my fault

52:03.854 --> 52:06.448
because I never should have allowed it
to go on as long as it did.

52:07.858 --> 52:11.851
That's why David's so important to me.
Because he cares about you kids.

52:11.962 --> 52:14.658
He wants you to be here
and be part of your lives.

52:14.764 --> 52:16.755
He's so perfect, isn't he?

52:19.402 --> 52:20.994
Take those off.

52:23.340 --> 52:26.605
I thought you'd be able to see
how happy David makes me.

52:26.710 --> 52:28.371
He is part of this family now.

52:28.478 --> 52:31.936
I want him in my life and our lives
and you need to understand that.

52:32.048 --> 52:35.245
-Do you understand that, Michael?
-Yeah. I understand. Okay?

52:41.791 --> 52:42.917
Okay.

52:59.342 --> 53:01.242
-David, are you down...
-I'm just putting some things away.

53:01.344 --> 53:04.040
-I'll be right up.
-Okay.

53:27.771 --> 53:29.329
Sorry I didn't make it,

53:29.439 --> 53:33.569
Definitely next time, But I did check out
your soon-to-be stepfather,

53:33.677 --> 53:38.637
I still don't like him, but at least
he seems to be who he says he is,

53:38.748 --> 53:41.342
It was good seeing you, Michael, Dad,

55:01.498 --> 55:03.762
Hey, Robert. What happened over there?

55:03.867 --> 55:05.858
Mrs. Cutter died. She had an accident.

55:07.270 --> 55:10.603
I guess her niece called a couple of times.
Didn't hear anything from her.

55:10.707 --> 55:13.574
So she stopped by the house
and found her just this morning.

55:14.778 --> 55:17.576
-That's sad.
-Have a good one.

55:24.254 --> 55:27.815
Mom? There's a bunch of police cars
across the street.

55:27.924 --> 55:29.186
What's going on?

55:29.292 --> 55:31.021
The old woman across the street?

55:31.127 --> 55:33.618
She fell down her stairs and broke her neck.
The one with the cats.

55:33.730 --> 55:35.027
-Mrs. Cutter?
-Yeah.

55:35.131 --> 55:37.531
That's horrible. When did it happen?

55:37.634 --> 55:40.068
The mailman said her niece
found her this morning.

55:40.170 --> 55:41.660
That poor woman.

55:41.771 --> 55:44.433
Sean. Hurry. We got to go, honey.

55:44.974 --> 55:47.841
All those things I've said about her.
I feel terrible.

55:47.944 --> 55:51.311
It breaks my heart. Will you remember
to pick them up from the dentist?

55:51.414 --> 55:55.316
-Yeah, I will. Okay, guys.
-Bye.

55:55.418 --> 55:57.579
-See you.
-I'll see you.

56:17.474 --> 56:20.272
-Hello.
-David, it's Jackie,

56:20.377 --> 56:21.401
Hey, Jackie. What's up?

56:21.511 --> 56:24.036
I'm just calling to remind you
about those forms,

56:24.147 --> 56:25.910
-I'm not working there anymore.
-I know,

56:26.015 --> 56:29.416
It's just, we still need
the state and federal tax papers

56:29.519 --> 56:31.384
and I'm leaving tomorrow.

56:31.488 --> 56:34.582
I'm catching a flight to meet Leah
in Hawaii for two weeks,

56:34.691 --> 56:37.387
and so I'd really like
to get that paperwork in before I leave.

56:37.494 --> 56:41.089
I'm a bit crunched for time today. I have to
pick the kids up from the dentist later...

56:41.197 --> 56:42.789
It'll only take a few minutes,

56:48.538 --> 56:51.006
-I'll see what I can do.
-Thanks...

56:57.147 --> 56:59.581
It's really too bad
what happened to Mrs. Cutter, isn't it?

57:01.050 --> 57:02.779
Accidents happen.

57:04.220 --> 57:06.654
It just must have been her time.

57:11.895 --> 57:13.760
-Hey.
-College applications.

57:13.863 --> 57:16.923
My adviser said we should file early in case
we don't get into U of O.

57:17.033 --> 57:18.523
Okay.

57:18.635 --> 57:20.466
-Come on.
-I'm coming.

57:27.944 --> 57:30.504
It all sounds circumstantial at best to me.

57:30.613 --> 57:32.513
I know, I know it does. I know it does.

57:32.615 --> 57:34.981
But I'm telling you,
it's really starting to give me the creeps.

57:35.084 --> 57:36.483
Just think about it, please.

57:36.586 --> 57:39.248
One day, this woman tells my mom
about this show that she saw,

57:39.355 --> 57:41.550
and the next, she's dead. She's dead now.

57:41.658 --> 57:43.922
It was an accident. You said so yourself.

57:44.027 --> 57:44.994
So how does he know that

57:45.094 --> 57:46.083
she broke her neck falling down the stairs?

57:46.196 --> 57:48.494
How does he know that?
The mailman never said anything about that.

57:48.598 --> 57:50.998
I heard the whole conversation, I swear.

57:51.401 --> 57:53.392
I wish I could tell my mom about this.

57:53.503 --> 57:55.733
If you bring this up to your mom,
she's gonna send you back.

58:04.814 --> 58:08.545
Hey, you got to admit,
the comment at the dinner table

58:08.651 --> 58:11.984
about the woman who killed her kids
was kind of weird.

58:12.088 --> 58:14.147
Come on, it was weird to say the least.
And then his daughter.

58:14.257 --> 58:15.690
How do you mix up
your daughter's name like that?

58:15.792 --> 58:20.354
He didn't. Her name was Lisa-Michelle.
That's what you said he said.

58:20.463 --> 58:22.795
-I said he said that. But you weren't there.
-Right?

58:22.899 --> 58:24.389
You didn't see his face. It's in his face.

58:25.435 --> 58:27.960
Let me get this straight, all right?

58:28.471 --> 58:29.904
-The neighborhood weirdo...
-Yeah.

58:30.006 --> 58:32.099
...sees a show
about a man who kills his family

58:32.208 --> 58:36.668
and then you think that David mixed up
the name of his daughter,

58:36.779 --> 58:40.271
so therefore
he's the guy that killed his family?

58:40.850 --> 58:43.751
-I don't know.
-Yeah, that all adds up to me.

58:50.593 --> 58:53.153
Look, you said
your dad checked up on him, right?

58:53.263 --> 58:55.254
-And everything was cool.
-Yeah.

58:55.365 --> 58:57.299
Okay, then. Right?

58:59.802 --> 59:01.326
It's fine. Relax.

59:11.314 --> 59:13.043
Are we gonna finish these?

59:13.850 --> 59:15.283
Babe, come on.

59:16.953 --> 59:18.011
Damn it, Michael.

59:29.165 --> 59:30.894
Michael.

59:35.171 --> 59:36.798
You're obsessing.

59:37.574 --> 59:41.943
You know, you're just a little freaked out
that your mom's marrying a stranger.

59:42.045 --> 59:45.173
I was the same way
when my mom was gonna marry Jack.

59:45.281 --> 59:49.217
You know?
And then he turned out to be cool.

59:51.454 --> 59:53.854
If you're gonna obsess about something,

59:53.957 --> 59:56.016
you should obsess about something
that really matters.

59:57.193 --> 59:58.319
Like what?

59:58.962 --> 01:00:00.259
Like me.

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:07.232
I don't want to have
another long-distance relationship with you.

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:12.907
So keep your eye on the ball.

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:34.920
I'm gonna pick up Sean and Beth.
I'll be back in an hour.

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:37.932
-Will you two be all right?
-Yeah, why wouldn't we be?

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:41.433
I'll see you in a while then. Behave.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.148
Come on.

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:02.156
-What are you gonna do?
-I'm just gonna look through his stuff.

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:03.825
You're crazy.

01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:08.953
-You're so gonna regret doing this.
-Only if I get caught.

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:21.103
Michael, come on, I don't want to do this.

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:23.735
Look, if we find nothing, I'll drop it forever.
I promise.

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:30.076
-Hello.
-Hey, you,

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:32.848
I just finished shopping,
so I'm gonna pick the kids up after all,

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:36.914
-I just left the house. I'm on my way.
-That's okay 'cause I'm so much closer.

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:39.392
-But thank you.
-Well, okay then.

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:41.861
-I'll see you at home. Bye.
-Okay, Bye,

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:09.051
Did you just hear that?

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:13.121
No. We're alone, Kelly. It's fine.

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:32.914
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Shit!

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:34.843
Shit!

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:10.249
Michael.

01:03:13.156 --> 01:03:15.090
Michael, you in there?

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.123
You in here, Michael?

01:04:21.924 --> 01:04:23.323
Michael!

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:41.509
Michael, did you ever hear from your dad?

01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:44.539
Well, I got a text message from him, so...

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:46.639
Really? What'd he say?

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:51.852
Just that he was sorry
for not coming by before his flight.

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:54.855
I've tried calling a couple times
and I just get his voicemail, so...

01:04:56.092 --> 01:04:58.185
I don't know. I'll probably text him tonight.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:02.186
Honey, I'm sure he just got crazy with work.
You know how Dad gets.

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:04.289
Yeah, yeah. No, I know.

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:09.531
David?

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.315
David, you okay?

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:24.976
Yes, I'm fine.

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:30.017
I know. I almost pissed my pants,
I was so scared.

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:33.892
-You know, that's not a turn-on, by the way,
-Michael, shut up. I'm being serious.

01:05:33.996 --> 01:05:36.055
-I know. I know.
-You do?

01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:40.534
Yeah. I mean, I've been thinking about
what you said, about all of it, really.

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:43.628
And I've decided that...

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:47.542
That you're right.
I mean, maybe, maybe, I am obsessing.

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:49.907
-You think?
-I mean, my dad said he was all right, so,,,

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:52.640
I guess the rest of it is just me freaking out.

01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:54.940
I think you should come by tomorrow

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:56.382
and we'll get these
college applications finished.

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:59.352
-No more obsessing?
-No, no, no, I swear on my life.

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:02.724
-All right? So I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay, Good night,

01:06:02.825 --> 01:06:03.917
Okay. Night.

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:13.692
Yeah, come in.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:16.829
-Hey, you got a sec?
-Sure. What's up?

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.299
-How you doing?
-Fine.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.974
Maybe I'm wrong, but for a while there,
I thought we were off to a good start.

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:34.214
And now I'm getting the feeling that
somehow we're not on the same page.

01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:38.724
I know it can't happen overnight, Michael.

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:41.460
But for the sake of the family,

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:44.931
you gotta understand that
things are going to change around here.

01:06:45.034 --> 01:06:47.264
It's not gonna be like it was,

01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:49.936
but hopefully better.

01:06:50.039 --> 01:06:52.371
-Yeah, I do. I know.
-Good.

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:59.474
I just want you
to always be up-front with me.

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:03.143
No lies, no sneaking around.

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:05.715
Your mom wouldn't like that.

01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:08.955
And you need to win back her trust.

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:23.097
I don't want to see you have to go back
to that school again.

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:05.977
-You swore on your life.
-Just look at the police sketches.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:07.549
Please, that's all I'm asking.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:12.782
There is a resemblance.
You got to admit, it kind of looks like him.

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:21.120
You know who this actually looks like?

01:08:21.897 --> 01:08:24.627
It looks like Mr. Rockwell,
our biology teacher from freshman year.

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:27.292
-No, you hardly looked at it.
-All right. It could be anybody.

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:30.064
Look, this is Grady Edwards.
The police couldn't match his lD.

01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:32.504
They couldn't trace any fingerprints.
And there are similarities.

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:35.099
He said he was in sales.
He said he traveled a lot.

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:36.644
They can never find
any pictures of him either,

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:37.904
so I asked Beth this morning

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:40.743
if she could find any pictures of him
in the house, any pictures of David.

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:43.751
There aren't any because he doesn't like
having his picture taken, apparently.

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:47.687
So what? Neither do l. But I swear
I didn't kill that woman and her kids. Okay?

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:50.350
-lt doesn't prove anything.
-The website was in the browser history.

01:08:50.459 --> 01:08:52.984
-He was checking it out.
-So what if he was?

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:55.062
Or maybe it was your mom.

01:08:55.163 --> 01:08:59.122
Or maybe they both were because they were
curious about what Mrs. Cutter said.

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:02.068
I mean, that's what made you check it out.

01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:03.904
All right.

01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:06.805
It's fine. Just forget about it.

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:18.778
-Are we gonna finish these, Michael?
-Hold on one second.

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:28.420
What is it? You just don't want to go
to college with me anymore?

01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:35.470
By the way, I'm screwing Mark Helford.

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:42.337
What?

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:46.481
I'm leaving. I'm going home.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:50.845
Call me later. Or, you know what,

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:53.421
don't actually. I don't care. Whatever.
You know.

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:54.921
Kelly. Kelly, come on.

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:15.136
I'm sorry. God, I didn't even know
you were there. You scared me, Mr. Harris.

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:16.677
Call me David.

01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:21.171
I was just getting myself a lemonade.
Do you want one?

01:10:22.418 --> 01:10:23.715
No, that's okay.

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:29.248
Looked like Michael and you
were having a bit of a fight.

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:33.386
No.

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:37.527
It's nothing, really.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:40.725
Anything I can help you with?

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:42.929
-No, it's cool.
-You sure?

01:10:44.206 --> 01:10:46.140
Something seems to be troubling him.

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:48.039
Maybe the two of us
can help him work it out.

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:55.607
I don't know. It's just...

01:10:56.652 --> 01:10:59.746
I don't get it. He's been such a jerk lately.

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:03.386
It's called being a guy. We're all jerks.

01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:07.719
That's why you women like us.
We're like projects you take on.

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:15.169
See, Kelly,

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:20.064
young women like you
seem to mature faster.

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:23.740
It takes boys a little longer to catch up.

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:28.713
You know, you might be
a part of the Harding family one day.

01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:33.253
And I'd like you to think of me as
you would the others, as family, too.

01:11:34.423 --> 01:11:35.981
Yeah, I do.

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:38.855
I mean, you know, I will.

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:44.789
And if you ever need anything,

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:48.202
please come to me.

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:52.071
Especially if it concerns Michael.

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:58.310
Neither of us want to see him
do something stupid, do we?

01:11:58.414 --> 01:12:00.939
Something that might get him
sent back to military school.

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:02.947
He won't.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.649
But thank you, Mr. Harris.

01:12:07.823 --> 01:12:10.656
David. Call me David.

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:28.772
Hi, I'm not here, I'm there, Leave a message,

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:30.310
Hey, it's me.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.239
I really want to see you tonight,
so give me a call. Bye.

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:48.459
Sorry it took so long to get back,
I'll try to call you in the next few days,

01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:51.356
Hope all is well, Dad,

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:10.919
I've tried to reach you on your phone,
Want to talk to you about David,

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:12.778
Call me, Jackie,

01:13:42.885 --> 01:13:45.217
This is Jay Harding, Leave a message,

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:47.650
I have to call you back on that,

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:50.088
but the money sounds like
we're in the ballpark.

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:52.217
We'll talk tomorrow. All right.

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:56.161
What's up, Michael?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

01:13:57.599 --> 01:13:58.861
No, l...

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:04.562
I heard a phone ring. I thought it sounded
like it was coming from the basement.

01:14:04.673 --> 01:14:09.133
You probably just heard mine.
I got a call on a job. I think I'm gonna take it.

01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:12.372
Money sounds good.
I won't have to travel much.

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:16.649
Hey, where's the key?
David, where's the key to the basement?

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:18.617
Yeah, I was wondering that myself.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.450
I needed to get some of my tools
this morning. The key was gone.

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:23.457
Someone took it out
and forgot to put it back.

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:25.686
Forgot to put what back?

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:27.125
-Hey, honey.
-Hey, guys.

01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:31.632
That key to the lock on the basement door is
missing. I'll call a locksmith in the morning.

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:33.223
Better yet,

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:37.066
I'll go down to Home Depot and get
a replacement. That lock was getting old.

01:14:37.172 --> 01:14:40.801
I can do the work myself. By the way,

01:14:40.909 --> 01:14:42.638
I think I found a job.

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:44.609
That's fantastic.

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:48.171
Yeah, the pay's good and very little travel.

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:51.247
-I like that.
-I thought you would.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.517
-Let's celebrate.
-Okay.

01:15:07.803 --> 01:15:11.239
-Maybe you should get a job this summer.
-He's already got one.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.737
He's the lifeguard at the pool here.

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:16.072
No, no, I'm serious. That way you could earn
money toward getting a car.

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:18.271
You're getting your license.

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:20.405
You're gonna need a car of your own.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:23.644
Especially if you're gonna spend
your senior year here in Portland.

01:15:23.752 --> 01:15:25.344
-Wait, Mom.
-Are you serious?

01:15:25.454 --> 01:15:28.617
-Wait, do you mean that?
-Yeah, I think David's right.

01:15:28.724 --> 01:15:32.251
The only way for us to be a proper family
is if you're home with us.

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:35.262
Besides, when you go to college,
you're not going to come back.

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:38.060
-Who wants dessert?
-Me. I do.

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:41.461
I'm gonna drop Sean and Beth off
at the Kagans,

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:42.935
'cause they're gonna spend the night

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:45.802
and then Carrie's mom's gonna drive them
up to camp tomorrow.

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:47.842
-Want to ride with me?
-I wish I could.

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:50.537
But I need to get back on the lnternet
and finalize this job.

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:53.137
Okay. I should only be a couple hours.

01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:55.148
A couple hours. Okay.

01:15:58.053 --> 01:16:00.419
-Well, have fun, guys.
-Bye.

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.422
-Bye.
-Bye, David.

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:07.629
-Susan.
-Yeah.

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:09.461
I love you.

01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:12.593
I love you, too.

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:39.158
What are your plans this evening?

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:43.191
I might go see Kelly.

01:16:43.832 --> 01:16:45.197
For how long?

01:16:46.034 --> 01:16:47.797
I don't know. Why?

01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:52.801
Just be careful. The news said
there's a big storm headed this way.

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:36.909
It's gone.

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:39.180
-What?
-The shot I took of him before?

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:42.051
It's gone. He deleted it and now
there's no pictures of him anywhere.

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:44.717
-Well, maybe you deleted it by accident.
-No, I didn't...

01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:46.054
Have you not been listening to me?

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:47.958
I thought you said he didn't see you take it.

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:49.655
Maybe he did or maybe he's been

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:51.062
checking my phone this whole time.
I don't know.

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:56.103
But he came into my room when I was in
the shower. He deleted it. I know he did.

01:17:56.204 --> 01:18:00.106
-He doesn't want his picture taken.
-That doesn't mean he's a killer.

01:18:03.779 --> 01:18:07.715
The key to the basement didn't just get lost,
all right. He's always down there.

01:18:07.816 --> 01:18:09.511
He's hiding something.

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:13.247
So what's the weather like?
I'm trying to pack.

01:18:14.256 --> 01:18:16.918
All you're gonna need
is a bikini and a smile,

01:18:17.025 --> 01:18:20.517
Neither if you forget the bikini, because
I'll have enough smile for both of us,

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:24.531
-Hold on a sec.
-Are you on your cell phone?

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:25.759
Hey, This is Susan, Leave me a message,,,

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:28.427
If you're trying to do some
last-minute business, give it a rest,

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:32.303
-You've got a plane to catch in three hours,
-No, I'm trying to reach Susan.

01:18:32.407 --> 01:18:34.136
I think I did something stupid.

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:35.641
I called Jay

01:18:35.744 --> 01:18:39.407
and I left a message that I wanted him
to do a background check on David.

01:18:39.514 --> 01:18:41.641
You think you did something stupid?

01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:45.744
Listen, I called him about the W-2s
and he hung up on me.

01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:48.789
He never did anything he said that he would.

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:50.619
She is going to kill you,

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:55.629
I know. That's why I need to reach her
before Jay gets to her first. Okay?

01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:59.997
So, please, do me a favor. I will call you
during my layover in L.A., okay?

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:03.094
No, don't, I'm going on a party cruise
around the island tonight,

01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:05.332
-Really?
-Just get here!

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:08.206
I'm trying.

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:11.711
-Love you,
-Love you, too. Bye.

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:36.726
I wasn't able to get you on your cell phone
before I left, but I wanted you to know

01:19:36.838 --> 01:19:40.296
that I left a message for Jay to run
a background check on David,

01:19:40.408 --> 01:19:43.741
And I haven't heard back, so I'm gonna call
this investigator we use at the office

01:19:43.845 --> 01:19:46.405
when I get to the airport,
Before you go ballistic, let me tell you

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:50.383
that he refuses to give any identification
for insurance and payroll,

01:19:50.485 --> 01:19:52.885
And he lied to me,
There's something not right here,

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:54.979
I'm leaving for the airport
in about 20 minutes,

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:57.149
If we don't talk, I'll call when I get back,

01:19:57.259 --> 01:20:00.160
I love you, Don't be mad, please,

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:13.598
Portland Tribune,

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:17.269
Hello. I need to speak to someone
about canceling a subscription.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:02.539
God, you scared me.
I didn't think anybody was home.

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:05.340
-You're home early.
-What, did you go running?

01:23:05.447 --> 01:23:08.382
-I needed to clear my head.
-Did Jackie call?

01:23:09.484 --> 01:23:10.542
Not since I've been home.

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:12.745
Because I had a missed call
and she didn't leave a message.

01:23:12.854 --> 01:23:14.685
I tried to reach her. I couldn't.

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:17.451
-Where's Michael?
-Over at Kelly's.

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:19.720
I'm gonna change clothes real quick.

01:23:36.644 --> 01:23:39.010
God, I hate it when it storms like this.

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:43.340
I can never sleep
with all this thunder and lightning.

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:50.257
Here. Take one of these.

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:52.690
-What is it?
-It's a mild sleeping pill.

01:23:53.161 --> 01:23:56.653
-They make you so groggy the next day.
-So will no sleep.

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:58.062
Just take half.

01:23:58.433 --> 01:23:59.923
-Really?
-Sure.

01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:11.478
I don't like Michael out in this.

01:24:12.247 --> 01:24:14.511
Well, let's call him and get him home.

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:20.349
No, that's okay.
I've just got to stop treating him like a child.

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:29.561
All right, stay here. If you see any movement

01:24:29.664 --> 01:24:31.097
upstairs or see anyone come downstairs,

01:24:31.199 --> 01:24:34.066
any lights, call me. I've got it on vibrate.

01:24:34.169 --> 01:24:36.694
Well, Michael, what are you doing?

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:40.007
I'm gonna find out
what's in those storage cabinets.

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:44.545
That's insane, Michael. Really, what if...
Your mom just told you you could stay.

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:46.546
What do you think's gonna happen
when she finds out about this?

01:24:46.648 --> 01:24:47.672
And she will find out about it...

01:24:47.782 --> 01:24:51.218
Kelly, he's hiding something in there,
all right? I know he is.

01:24:51.453 --> 01:24:53.546
But you have to trust me.

01:24:54.322 --> 01:24:56.153
Please. Please.

01:24:56.257 --> 01:24:59.624
-Just please be careful.
-I will. Okay.

01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:50.596
Shit.

01:26:54.642 --> 01:26:56.075
Where is it?

01:27:40.888 --> 01:27:42.082
Honey?

01:28:03.544 --> 01:28:04.704
Finally.

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:09.575
God.

01:28:15.556 --> 01:28:16.614
Shit!

01:28:34.676 --> 01:28:36.200
Michael! Come on!

01:28:48.289 --> 01:28:49.813
Come on. Come on.

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:52.149
Pick up, Michael.

01:28:54.262 --> 01:28:55.388
Shit!

01:29:20.488 --> 01:29:21.853
Michael!

01:29:29.163 --> 01:29:31.222
What are you doing, Kelly?

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.428
Kelly!

01:29:45.913 --> 01:29:47.039
Come on!

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:53.577
Kelly!

01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:07.196
Kelly! Kelly!

01:30:10.838 --> 01:30:12.169
Kelly!

01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:41.266
What's all the noise?

01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:44.270
I thought I could make this work. But I can't!

01:30:44.372 --> 01:30:47.102
This isn't the right family for me.

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:50.109
The boy is a problem. He has no respect.

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:55.208
You haven't been hard enough on him.
You've got to make a boy understand!

01:30:55.316 --> 01:30:57.546
You've got to break him if necessary!

01:30:58.252 --> 01:31:01.119
-You're too weak to do that.
-What are you talking about?

01:31:01.222 --> 01:31:03.486
I thought it could work, but it can't!

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:07.526
I thought you could be Mrs. Grady Edwards!
But you can't!

01:31:09.197 --> 01:31:12.325
-What did you say?
-Wait. Wait a minute.

01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:17.131
Who am I here?

01:31:17.605 --> 01:31:19.539
-David, what are...
-David!

01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:22.265
David Harris.

01:31:23.911 --> 01:31:25.208
Mom!

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:28.710
Mom!

01:31:33.354 --> 01:31:35.948
No! No!

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:37.847
No!

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:39.993
Mom!

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:44.656
Kelly! Kelly!

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.933
Can you stand?

01:31:47.268 --> 01:31:48.360
That's it.

01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:51.031
-Michael!
-Listen to me.

01:32:38.819 --> 01:32:41.014
Mom, it's me. It's me. God!

01:32:41.122 --> 01:32:42.248
Among other things,
he ripped out all the phones.

01:32:42.356 --> 01:32:43.482
-I might have killed him.
-We have to go.

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:46.082
I can't let you do that, Michael.

01:32:47.929 --> 01:32:50.693
Get back, get back. Get upstairs now!
Move! Move!

01:32:51.198 --> 01:32:54.031
-Go! Go! Go!
-Stay away!

01:33:13.888 --> 01:33:19.121
Help us! Help! Help!

01:33:19.527 --> 01:33:21.358
Careful where you step.

01:33:21.796 --> 01:33:24.890
There's still some rotted boards
I haven't replaced yet.

01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:32.696
Michael! Michael!

01:33:37.979 --> 01:33:40.106
-No! No!
-Michael!

01:33:44.652 --> 01:33:45.983
Michael!

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:49.584
Michael!

01:33:50.691 --> 01:33:52.454
Get away from him!

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:57.423
Come here! Come on!

01:33:57.531 --> 01:33:59.260
Leave him alone!

01:33:59.567 --> 01:34:00.534
Kelly!

01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:02.659
-Kelly, watch out!
-Kelly!

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:06.262
Come on, take me! Kelly! Run! Mom!

01:36:00.888 --> 01:36:02.116
What happened?

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.260
What happened?

01:36:08.796 --> 01:36:10.491
You were in a coma.

01:36:16.137 --> 01:36:17.570
How long?

01:36:18.038 --> 01:36:19.596
Just over a month.

01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:24.436
Michael!

01:36:24.545 --> 01:36:26.342
What about David?

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:29.005
Where is he?

01:36:30.584 --> 01:36:32.176
Nobody knows.

01:36:34.822 --> 01:36:37.416
By the time the police got there,
he was gone.

01:36:44.832 --> 01:36:45.958
He's gone?

01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:57.670
Gone?

01:37:02.449 --> 01:37:04.974
-Hi.
-Hi. Yes, ma'am. Can I help you?

01:37:05.085 --> 01:37:08.782
I have got this little lightbulb
that I need for their nightlights.

01:37:08.889 --> 01:37:10.220
-Can you tell me where I can find that?
-Come on!

01:37:10.324 --> 01:37:12.485
Yep. Aisle two. You're welcome.

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:14.925
Andy, Ross, where'd you go?

01:37:17.998 --> 01:37:19.124
Guys?

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:23.399
Hey, hey, guys, come on! Knock it off!
Get back over here!

01:37:25.472 --> 01:37:27.565
Come on, guys, wait for me.

01:37:28.309 --> 01:37:32.643
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Guys, come on.
Let's go.

01:37:32.746 --> 01:37:35.874
That's okay. You know what they say,
boys will be boys.

01:37:37.284 --> 01:37:39.275
Do you have any children?

01:37:39.386 --> 01:37:41.980
I lost my wife and daughter in a car accident.

01:37:42.089 --> 01:37:44.649
-I'm sorry.
-No, that's okay.

01:37:44.758 --> 01:37:46.055
It's been nearly a year now.

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.857
I kind of know what you're going through.
I lost my husband two years ago.

01:37:49.964 --> 01:37:52.933
I know it's hard sometimes,
but it does get easier.

01:37:53.033 --> 01:37:54.364
I hope so.

01:37:55.636 --> 01:37:57.467
Hey, I'm Chris Ames.

01:37:57.705 --> 01:38:01.334
-I'm Julie King. Nice to meet you.
-Well, it's nice to meet you.
