00:01.669 --> 00:04.169
Everywhere that you look,

00:04.205 --> 00:06.665
there are monuments that
the archaeologists had

00:06.707 --> 00:09.307
absolutely no knowledge of whatsoever.

00:09.343 --> 00:12.613
It would seem to be all of the cultures

00:12.646 --> 00:15.676
were trying to signal
some kind of sky people.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.818
What if, when we go past that wall,

00:20.855 --> 00:23.355
the real treasure trove
is waiting inside?

00:24.925 --> 00:27.355
With the technology that has been

00:27.395 --> 00:30.155
and is being developed at the moment,

00:30.197 --> 00:33.497
archaeology will have to accept the fact

00:33.534 --> 00:36.404
we have been visited
by extraterrestrials

00:36.437 --> 00:37.897
in the remote past.

00:37.938 --> 00:41.338
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:41.375 --> 00:45.375
mankind has credited its origins to gods

00:45.413 --> 00:48.583
and other visitors from the stars.

00:48.616 --> 00:51.546
What if it were true?

00:51.585 --> 00:53.545
Did extraterrestrial beings

00:53.587 --> 00:56.957
really help to shape our history?

00:56.991 --> 01:00.661
And if so, will new evidence reveal,

01:00.694 --> 01:03.764
once and for all, that we are not alone?

# Ancient Aliens 11x04 #
The New Evidence
Original Air Date on May 27, 2016

01:36.831 --> 01:39.831
Throughout recorded history,

01:39.867 --> 01:41.827
archaeologists have discovered

01:41.869 --> 01:46.639
new structures, carvings and texts

01:46.674 --> 01:49.684
that have put into question

01:49.710 --> 01:52.480
the established notions of our past.

01:52.513 --> 01:55.553
Ruins dating back thousands of years

01:55.583 --> 01:58.553
reveal engineering skill

01:58.586 --> 02:01.446
surpassing even modern capabilities.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.389
Ancient rock art

02:03.424 --> 02:06.834
depicts figures that
resemble astronauts.

02:06.861 --> 02:11.261
And mysterious monoliths
aligned with the stars

02:11.298 --> 02:14.898
dot the landscapes
of nearly every continent.

02:14.935 --> 02:19.395
In his 1968 book, Chariots of the Gods?,

02:19.440 --> 02:23.280
Erich von Daniken proposed
that all of this evidence

02:23.310 --> 02:25.580
pointed to one profound truth,

02:25.613 --> 02:28.313
that extraterrestrials had visited Earth

02:28.349 --> 02:30.219
in the distant past

02:30.251 --> 02:33.021
and changed the course of human history.

02:35.389 --> 02:39.289
This concept is known
as ancient astronaut theory,

02:39.326 --> 02:40.926
and today it is embraced

02:40.961 --> 02:44.601
by literally millions
of people around the world.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.972
Everyone in this room wants to ask,

02:47.001 --> 02:49.431
have you watched Ancient Aliens,

02:49.470 --> 02:52.500
and what's your comment
about that series?

02:52.540 --> 02:56.310
King Tut's tomb may
have more mysteries to reveal.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.743
The California Institute
of Technology published

02:58.779 --> 03:00.479
a study claiming they have discovered

03:00.514 --> 03:03.384
a true ninth planet beyond Pluto.

03:03.417 --> 03:06.417
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest

03:06.453 --> 03:09.963
the evidence that
extraterrestrials visited Earth

03:09.990 --> 03:12.090
is all around us

03:12.126 --> 03:15.186
and say that with new technology,

03:15.229 --> 03:18.259
we are uncovering more proof
than ever before.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.999
Liquid water has been found on Mars.

03:22.036 --> 03:24.566
NASA's Hubble
Space Telescope... have made

03:24.605 --> 03:27.965
independent confirmations in the
hunt for extra-solar planets.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.008
Gliese 581.

03:30.044 --> 03:32.544
This would be the most
Earth-like exoplanet

03:32.580 --> 03:34.810
yet discovered.

03:34.848 --> 03:37.678
In the past few years,

03:37.718 --> 03:42.918
different shafts were discovered
in the Great Pyramid.

03:42.957 --> 03:46.927
That was only possible because
of our modern technology.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.359
The same thing happens in astronomy.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.569
Because of the Hubble Telescope,

03:53.601 --> 03:55.471
we have discovered more than

03:55.502 --> 03:59.972
two-and-a-half thousand
so-called exoplanets,

04:00.007 --> 04:02.977
planets out of our solar system.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.940
The same thing in genetics.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.178
It's all connected.

04:09.216 --> 04:13.546
We should finally understand to
link all these things together.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.059
With all of the new technologies

04:18.091 --> 04:20.031
that archaeologists have to use now,

04:20.060 --> 04:24.060
ground-penetrating radar,
satellite images,

04:24.098 --> 04:27.368
uh, even the access of Google Earth,

04:27.401 --> 04:32.171
has been a tremendous boon
to archaeologists,

04:32.206 --> 04:37.136
and they're now finding things
that we never thought existed.

04:37.177 --> 04:40.207
Science ultimately is a belief system

04:40.247 --> 04:42.047
that is based on certain evidence,

04:42.082 --> 04:44.582
but as new evidence comes in,

04:44.618 --> 04:47.018
authentic scientific
investigation requires you

04:47.054 --> 04:49.554
to incorporate that evidence

04:49.590 --> 04:52.390
into the model
that you are constructing.

04:52.426 --> 04:55.486
If we look at the recent findings,

04:55.529 --> 04:59.459
we're seeing the most
revolutionary breakthroughs

04:59.500 --> 05:01.570
in the field of ancient astronaut theory

05:01.602 --> 05:03.502
that we have ever seen.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.013
Wiltshire, England.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.107
Here stands one of the most mysterious

05:12.146 --> 05:15.676
stone monuments on Earth, Stonehenge.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.988
For centuries, it has
baffled archaeologists,

05:21.021 --> 05:24.121
but in September of 2015,

05:24.158 --> 05:26.728
just two miles away,

05:26.760 --> 05:28.760
a discovery was made that could provide

05:28.796 --> 05:31.326
an important new piece to the puzzle.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.573
At the Durrington Walls,

05:34.601 --> 05:37.971
Great Britain's largest
ancient henge structure--

05:38.005 --> 05:39.965
or circular earthwork--

05:40.007 --> 05:44.077
archaeologists, using
ground-penetrating radar,

05:44.111 --> 05:46.781
uncovered something astonishing,

05:46.814 --> 05:50.654
nearly 100 monolithic standing stones.

05:52.186 --> 05:56.116
Recently, a type of
super-henge was discovered

05:56.156 --> 05:58.686
only two miles from Stonehenge,

05:58.726 --> 06:02.056
and it's a giant mystery because,

06:02.096 --> 06:05.656
according to the working
archaeologists, it's older.

06:05.699 --> 06:09.739
So the question now is,
if it's older than Stonehenge,

06:09.770 --> 06:13.510
what was its purpose,
and why was it built?

06:15.042 --> 06:19.582
This is the southern side
of Durrington Walls,

06:19.613 --> 06:22.983
the southern edge
of the great Superhenge.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.476
And beneath my feet

06:25.519 --> 06:28.949
is at least one and another here

06:28.989 --> 06:32.059
of the 90 great stones.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.294
Now, these stones,

06:35.329 --> 06:39.259
which were perhaps 15 feet in size,

06:39.299 --> 06:44.069
weighing anything between
ten and 15 tons apiece,

06:44.104 --> 06:46.914
were part of a huge arc

06:46.940 --> 06:50.980
that faced out towards
the northern night sky.

06:51.011 --> 06:55.211
They were constructed as part
of a mysterious monument

06:55.249 --> 06:58.179
even earlier than Durrington Walls,

06:58.218 --> 07:02.118
which dates to around 2500 BC.

07:02.156 --> 07:03.616
So they could be hundreds,

07:03.657 --> 07:07.557
perhaps even thousands,
of years earlier,

07:07.594 --> 07:10.634
and exactly why it's here
is a complete mystery.

07:10.664 --> 07:13.374
These stones were purposely buried,

07:13.400 --> 07:16.570
and they seem to be part
of a ritual complex

07:16.603 --> 07:18.503
that goes way beyond
that particular site,

07:18.539 --> 07:21.669
into the entire plain
on which it's found.

07:21.708 --> 07:25.138
So these stones encircle
one part of the site

07:25.179 --> 07:27.249
and were consequently
buried under a mound,

07:27.281 --> 07:29.111
which is really mysterious.

07:29.149 --> 07:32.619
While the stones of Superhenge

07:32.653 --> 07:35.923
that have been discovered
so far form an arc,

07:35.956 --> 07:40.386
many researchers believe that
it was originally a full circle,

07:40.427 --> 07:42.787
much like another ancient structure

07:42.830 --> 07:47.730
located just 300 yards
to the south, Woodhenge.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.438
This is Woodhenge.

07:51.839 --> 07:54.439
This was a smaller monument

07:54.475 --> 07:58.405
consisting of six concentric rings

07:58.445 --> 08:02.305
of wooden posts that pointed
up towards the sky

08:02.349 --> 08:06.319
as much as 4,000 years ago.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.453
And this monument itself,

08:08.489 --> 08:12.919
being circular in the same way
that Stonehenge was,

08:12.960 --> 08:15.990
suggests to us that the 90 stones

08:16.029 --> 08:19.399
around the edge of Durrington

08:19.433 --> 08:22.333
was a huge great circle in itself,

08:22.369 --> 08:26.199
the largest ring of stones
anywhere in Europe,

08:26.240 --> 08:28.010
perhaps even in the world.

08:31.278 --> 08:34.607
Incredibly,
the newly discovered Superhenge

08:34.648 --> 08:36.278
is not all that has been uncovered

08:36.316 --> 08:38.015
beneath the earth here.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.951
Since July 2010,

08:40.988 --> 08:43.758
an international team of experts--

08:43.789 --> 08:47.290
as part of the Stonehenge
Hidden Landscapes Project--

08:47.327 --> 08:51.727
has been mapping the entire area
using the latest technology.

08:51.765 --> 08:56.935
More than 15 underground sites
have been found.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.900
There's no doubt that these finds

08:58.939 --> 09:02.039
will cause
English archaeologists to have

09:02.075 --> 09:04.075
to revisit everything
we know about Stonehenge,

09:04.111 --> 09:06.481
because Stonehenge
is not going to be considered

09:06.513 --> 09:08.583
an isolate or something that's curious.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.520
While mainstream scientists

09:11.552 --> 09:13.852
believe Stonehenge
and its surrounding sites

09:13.887 --> 09:17.387
were ancient ritual and burial grounds,

09:17.424 --> 09:21.834
there is no written record
to explain why ancient people

09:21.862 --> 09:24.602
chose to move and erect massive blocks

09:24.631 --> 09:26.801
that weigh up to 50 tons--

09:26.833 --> 09:31.503
some of which were transported
from over 100 miles away.

09:31.538 --> 09:35.208
And now that a second
Stonehenge has been found,

09:35.242 --> 09:38.542
the theory that these sites
were simply burial grounds

09:38.579 --> 09:41.249
has been thrown into greater question.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.146
These ancient people had a great deal

09:45.185 --> 09:48.685
of knowledge about how to align
these structures perfectly.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.592
So, we're dealing
with an advanced civilization,

09:51.625 --> 09:52.655
to say the least.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.463
Where they had that knowledge,

09:54.494 --> 09:56.164
where they got that knowledge,
where they developed

09:56.196 --> 09:59.556
the ability to put these
incredible monuments together,

09:59.600 --> 10:01.830
it boggles the mind.

10:01.868 --> 10:04.098
Archaeologists believe

10:04.137 --> 10:07.807
that Stonehenge's
two rings of standing stones

10:07.841 --> 10:11.411
may be simply the remains
of a much larger structure,

10:11.445 --> 10:13.505
based on the presence
of the earthen henge

10:13.547 --> 10:15.277
that surrounds it.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.521
This has led to speculation
that Superhenge

10:20.554 --> 10:23.394
also contained additional rings,

10:23.423 --> 10:27.663
and that these structures might
even have had walls and roofs.

10:29.896 --> 10:32.656
But if true, was this area of England

10:32.699 --> 10:35.929
much more than simply
a site of religious ceremony?

10:37.337 --> 10:39.137
When we look to these

10:39.172 --> 10:40.872
extraordinary structures on Earth,

10:40.907 --> 10:43.167
it makes you wonder,
did extraterrestrials have

10:43.210 --> 10:46.240
a hand in creating
these massive monuments?

10:46.279 --> 10:49.509
Or did they teach humans
how to build these monuments?

10:51.318 --> 10:53.918
So you have to wonder
what the purpose of these

10:53.954 --> 10:56.894
giant stone circles are
around the world.

10:56.923 --> 10:59.423
Is it possible that they were some

10:59.459 --> 11:02.629
kind of spaceport or a conceived city?

11:07.434 --> 11:09.474
Is it possible that Stonehenge

11:09.503 --> 11:12.203
and the many structures that surround it

11:12.239 --> 11:15.869
are the remnants of an
extraterrestrial spaceport?

11:17.544 --> 11:20.854
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

11:20.881 --> 11:24.151
and suggest that further proof exists

11:24.184 --> 11:26.694
in the form of DNA evidence,

11:26.720 --> 11:28.490
hidden in the tomb

11:28.522 --> 11:30.492
of King Tut.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.526
They have confirmed
that they might have discovered

11:35.562 --> 11:39.632
another passway behind
King Tut's burial chamber.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.896
We go in there,
we're going to find artifacts

11:41.935 --> 11:44.335
that could be undeniably

11:44.371 --> 11:45.571
extraterrestrial.

11:49.993 --> 11:53.463
Luxor, Egypt.

11:53.497 --> 11:56.867
Here lies the tomb of the
world's most famous pharaoh...

11:58.335 --> 12:00.695
King Tutankhamun.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.480
When it was discovered in 1922,

12:06.510 --> 12:08.910
completely intact and preserved

12:08.946 --> 12:11.776
after more than 3,000 years,

12:11.815 --> 12:14.445
it was considered
one of the most significant

12:14.485 --> 12:17.315
archaeological discoveries of all time.

12:19.056 --> 12:20.916
But as spectacular a find as it was,

12:20.958 --> 12:23.888
almost a century later,

12:23.927 --> 12:27.157
new evidence has come to light
that there may be much more

12:27.197 --> 12:31.167
to King Tut's final resting
place than meets the eye.

12:32.870 --> 12:35.500
While examining high-resolution
scans of the tomb

12:35.539 --> 12:38.869
on September 28, 2015,

12:38.909 --> 12:41.939
British Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves

12:41.979 --> 12:44.109
found something remarkable--

12:44.147 --> 12:47.577
the possibility of two hidden passages

12:47.618 --> 12:52.218
connected directly to
King Tut's burial chamber.

12:52.256 --> 12:53.916
There was a Spanish company,

12:53.957 --> 12:56.927
who was recruited
to scan the tomb of Tutankhamun

12:56.960 --> 12:59.460
in order to replicate it.

12:59.496 --> 13:03.296
It is through this high
definition photography scanning

13:03.333 --> 13:06.673
that Reeves noticed
that on the north wall

13:06.703 --> 13:09.403
of the burial chamber,
there is some cracks,

13:09.439 --> 13:12.569
indicating the possibility of a door.

13:12.609 --> 13:15.309
And also on the eastern wall.

13:15.345 --> 13:18.605
So there's two possible chambers.

13:18.649 --> 13:22.449
Reeves took his laser
images to Dr. Mamdouh Eldamaty,

13:22.486 --> 13:25.186
who is the Minister
of Antiquities in Egypt,

13:25.222 --> 13:29.362
and they both decided to dig further.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.893
They used thermal scanning,
which tells you

13:31.929 --> 13:34.499
the exact density of the wall
at every part.

13:34.531 --> 13:38.071
And they have confirmed
that they might have discovered

13:38.101 --> 13:40.571
another passway or a chamber

13:40.604 --> 13:44.444
behind King Tut's burial chamber.

13:44.474 --> 13:46.784
Whether there are more buried treasures

13:46.810 --> 13:50.410
beyond the painted walls
remains to be seen.

13:50.447 --> 13:54.617
But if so, Reeves has a theory.

13:54.651 --> 13:57.021
He believes the passageway may lead

13:57.054 --> 13:59.724
to the tomb of Queen Nefertiti--

13:59.756 --> 14:01.816
the wife of Pharaoh Akhenaten,

14:01.858 --> 14:06.258
who ruled during the 14th century BC.

14:07.664 --> 14:09.304
But why would Nefertiti's tomb

14:09.333 --> 14:11.333
be hidden beyond King Tut's?

14:11.368 --> 14:14.438
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe there may be

14:14.471 --> 14:16.571
a profound reason--

14:16.607 --> 14:18.737
that Queen Nefertiti

14:18.775 --> 14:20.775
was not of this world.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.846
Nefertiti's parents are unknown.

14:25.882 --> 14:28.682
On pictures, she is shown

14:28.719 --> 14:31.719
with one of these elongated heads.

14:31.755 --> 14:34.285
Now we know the gods,

14:34.324 --> 14:36.294
the old Egyptian gods,

14:36.326 --> 14:39.826
they had longer heads than we have.

14:39.863 --> 14:43.063
And according to the pyramid texts,

14:43.100 --> 14:45.400
sometimes they left the Earth,

14:45.435 --> 14:47.365
and then they returned again.

14:47.404 --> 14:52.144
So Nefertiti's parents
were maybe extraterrestrials.

14:52.175 --> 14:53.905
King Akhenaten and his wife

14:53.944 --> 14:55.614
looked completely different

14:55.646 --> 14:58.046
than all the other
ancient Egyptian kings.

14:58.081 --> 15:00.851
King Akhenaten always was depicted

15:00.884 --> 15:05.824
with an elongated skull,
a bigger-size hip,

15:05.856 --> 15:09.086
a belly that drools over his belt.

15:09.126 --> 15:12.386
He believed that he wasn't a man

15:12.429 --> 15:15.859
and he wasn't a woman
and he wasn't a king.

15:15.899 --> 15:18.129
He was just something else.

15:18.168 --> 15:21.598
The most unusual feature
is, uh, elongated skulls.

15:21.638 --> 15:23.708
There's been a lot of discussions

15:23.740 --> 15:25.210
about what these skulls meant.

15:25.242 --> 15:28.042
Whether they were
literally elongated skulls,

15:28.078 --> 15:30.878
or whether they were
just decoration features.

15:30.914 --> 15:32.984
It's certainly very intriguing.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.976
It doesn't appear before or afterwards.

15:35.018 --> 15:37.518
So there's something rather odd
about this, I have to admit.

15:39.056 --> 15:41.316
The reign of Akhenaten and Nefertiti

15:41.358 --> 15:43.988
introduced a new and controversial

15:44.027 --> 15:46.527
monotheistic faith to Egypt--

15:46.563 --> 15:50.473
worshipping the disc-shaped sun god Aten.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.070
The Aten was described

15:52.102 --> 15:54.842
as this flying sun disc.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.941
Egyptologists are

15:56.973 --> 16:00.783
merely saying that this
was nothing else but the sun,

16:00.811 --> 16:02.211
but the question is:

16:02.245 --> 16:06.775
Can the sun instruct you
in different disciplines?

16:06.817 --> 16:08.147
And the answer is no.

16:08.185 --> 16:11.615
So we have to see whether or not

16:11.655 --> 16:15.815
our ancestors encountered technology

16:15.859 --> 16:19.729
and misinterpreted it
as something in nature.

16:19.763 --> 16:21.803
Is it possible the depictions

16:21.832 --> 16:24.272
of Akhenaten and Nefertiti--

16:24.301 --> 16:27.771
along with their worship
of a disc-shaped god--

16:27.804 --> 16:31.974
are evidence that they
were not of this world?

16:32.008 --> 16:34.978
And if so, might Queen Nefertiti's tomb

16:35.011 --> 16:38.011
contain DNA evidence of

16:38.048 --> 16:40.978
their extraterrestrial origins?

16:41.017 --> 16:43.987
The ancient Egyptians did not want us

16:44.020 --> 16:46.890
to know anything
about Nefertiti or Akhenaten,

16:46.923 --> 16:48.523
or even Tutankhamen.

16:48.558 --> 16:51.758
They made every effort
they possibly could

16:51.795 --> 16:56.455
to erase all references
to their existence.

16:56.500 --> 16:59.400
So what is it about Nefertiti

16:59.436 --> 17:01.866
that makes the opening
of her tomb so powerful?

17:01.905 --> 17:04.464
This ultimately goes back to Akhenaten

17:04.508 --> 17:06.978
and Nefertiti's
introduction of the teaching

17:07.010 --> 17:10.579
of the celestial disc.

17:10.614 --> 17:14.324
What if, when we go past that wall,

17:14.351 --> 17:16.851
the real treasure trove
is waiting inside,

17:16.887 --> 17:19.646
and when we go in there,
we're going to find artifacts

17:19.689 --> 17:23.388
that could be
undeniably extraterrestrial?

17:23.425 --> 17:26.226
Could this tomb hide

17:26.262 --> 17:28.963
otherworldly secrets and treasures?

17:28.999 --> 17:30.929
Might we be on the verge

17:30.967 --> 17:33.167
of locating indisputable evidence

17:33.203 --> 17:35.703
of extraterrestrial intervention

17:35.739 --> 17:37.369
in the distant past?

17:37.407 --> 17:40.337
Perhaps additional pieces to the puzzle

17:40.377 --> 17:42.807
can be found deep within the temple

17:42.846 --> 17:46.176
of a flying serpent god.

17:50.587 --> 17:53.817
Why would you put liquid mercury

17:53.857 --> 17:55.187
inside a tomb?

17:56.893 --> 17:58.993
Mercury has very good uses

17:59.029 --> 18:01.499
in space travel.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.027
Teotihuacan, Mexico.

18:09.063 --> 18:12.673
April 24, 2015.

18:15.102 --> 18:16.702
For six years,

18:16.737 --> 18:19.367
Mexican archaeologist Sergio Gomez

18:19.407 --> 18:21.207
has been performing an excavation

18:21.242 --> 18:25.012
of the ancient city's
third largest pyramid,

18:25.046 --> 18:28.376
the Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl,

18:28.416 --> 18:31.746
which dates back to
the second century AD.

18:33.521 --> 18:36.321
Gomez has uncovered numerous relics

18:36.357 --> 18:38.287
in the course of his excavation,

18:38.326 --> 18:41.956
but on this date, he discovers
something completely unexpected

18:41.996 --> 18:45.496
in a chamber below the pyramid:

18:45.533 --> 18:49.173
Large quantities of liquid mercury.

18:49.203 --> 18:54.843
Gomez has been
gradually penetrating a tunnel

18:54.876 --> 18:57.736
and he's now reached

18:57.778 --> 19:00.248
a depth of 300 feet.

19:00.281 --> 19:03.381
But along the way,
they found liquid mercury.

19:03.417 --> 19:05.847
Now, why would you put

19:05.887 --> 19:08.247
liquid mercury inside a tomb?

19:08.289 --> 19:11.259
You wouldn't want
to put mercury down there

19:11.292 --> 19:12.562
just for the heck of it,

19:12.593 --> 19:14.533
because if you get too close to it,

19:14.562 --> 19:16.962
or too involved with it,
it's gonna kill you.

19:20.635 --> 19:24.265
Mercury is an extremely rare

19:24.305 --> 19:27.765
and conductive element that,
today, is used primarily

19:27.808 --> 19:30.308
in electronics and automobiles,

19:30.344 --> 19:32.784
so the presence of
this dangerous substance

19:32.813 --> 19:35.253
below an ancient Aztec pyramid

19:35.283 --> 19:37.823
has puzzled scientists.

19:37.852 --> 19:40.652
But ancient astronaut theorists believe

19:40.688 --> 19:43.718
the mercury found at this temple--

19:43.758 --> 19:46.358
a temple built to honor Quetzalcoatl,

19:46.394 --> 19:49.804
the feathered serpent
that came down from the sky--

19:49.830 --> 19:51.830
may have a direct connection

19:51.866 --> 19:56.336
to the beings the Aztecs
referred to as their gods.

19:56.370 --> 19:58.570
Now, liquid mercury

19:58.606 --> 20:00.866
was not only found in Teotihuacan.

20:00.908 --> 20:04.438
According to old Indian texts,

20:04.478 --> 20:08.108
liquid mercury was one part

20:08.149 --> 20:09.879
of the propulsion system

20:09.917 --> 20:12.317
which the extraterrestrials used

20:12.353 --> 20:15.923
for their flying machines.

20:15.957 --> 20:18.717
There are many legends
that the Nazis themselves

20:18.759 --> 20:21.429
actually went through
these Sanskrit texts

20:21.462 --> 20:23.102
in order to help them develop

20:23.130 --> 20:26.630
their own flying craft technology.

20:26.667 --> 20:31.097
What we know from the leaked
German scientific reports

20:31.138 --> 20:34.608
is that, apparently,
if you subject mercury

20:34.642 --> 20:37.282
to a very high level
of electrostatic charge

20:37.311 --> 20:39.211
and then rotate it,

20:39.246 --> 20:40.946
you get a gravitational thrust

20:40.982 --> 20:44.652
which allows you
to create inertial force

20:44.685 --> 20:47.215
that can counteract
the normal force of gravity.

20:49.156 --> 20:52.386
So the idea that
we have references to mercury

20:52.426 --> 20:55.156
in a chamber of the Feathered Serpent...

20:55.196 --> 20:57.256
One has to ask the question:

20:57.298 --> 20:59.568
what was this Feathered Serpent?

20:59.600 --> 21:02.600
According to
the ancient astronaut theory,

21:02.637 --> 21:05.197
we are talking about physical craft

21:05.239 --> 21:07.439
that, at some point,

21:07.475 --> 21:11.305
were misinterpreted as living creatures.

21:11.345 --> 21:15.505
Could this incredible
discovery of liquid mercury

21:15.549 --> 21:17.549
provide further proof

21:17.585 --> 21:21.015
that the Feathered Serpent
was actually a spacecraft?

21:21.055 --> 21:25.455
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe another toxic tomb

21:25.493 --> 21:28.433
may help answer this question.

21:30.097 --> 21:31.897
Shaanxi Province, China.

21:34.168 --> 21:36.568
Here, buried deep under a hill,

21:36.604 --> 21:39.144
lies Emperor Qin Shi Huang.

21:39.173 --> 21:42.883
Undisturbed for more than 2,000 years,

21:42.910 --> 21:45.010
his tomb is best known

21:45.046 --> 21:48.306
for the discovery of thousands
of Terra-cotta Warriors.

21:48.349 --> 21:52.479
But much of the massive
underground structure

21:52.520 --> 21:54.450
has not yet been excavated,

21:54.488 --> 21:56.588
due to high levels of mercury.

21:58.993 --> 22:00.533
If somebody were to ask me,

22:00.561 --> 22:02.361
"What is the most fantastic
archaeological site

22:02.396 --> 22:04.126
on the planet Earth?",

22:04.165 --> 22:06.525
my answer would be simple
and it would be quick:

22:06.567 --> 22:09.027
it's the tomb of Emperor Qin.

22:09.070 --> 22:12.400
Writings from the time of Emperor Qin,

22:12.440 --> 22:14.140
second century BC,

22:14.175 --> 22:17.835
told us that this guy
was buried in a tomb

22:17.878 --> 22:22.048
that had a scale model
of China inside of it,

22:22.083 --> 22:25.553
with flowing rivers of mercury
moving around the cities

22:25.586 --> 22:28.116
that were built in scale models.

22:30.424 --> 22:33.564
Is it coincidence
that an ancient tomb in China

22:33.594 --> 22:35.934
and an ancient temple in Mexico

22:35.963 --> 22:39.603
both contain liquid mercury?

22:39.633 --> 22:43.273
Curiously, much like the Aztec story

22:43.304 --> 22:45.604
of Quetzalcoatl
coming down from the sky,

22:45.639 --> 22:49.409
the Chinese say
the ancestor of Qin Shi Huang--

22:49.443 --> 22:51.043
the Yellow Emperor--

22:51.078 --> 22:53.478
descended from the heavens on a dragon.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.983
According to some mythological accounts,

22:59.019 --> 23:02.589
the Yellow Emperor was riding
around on a dragon

23:02.623 --> 23:05.093
when he saw the people of Earth in need.

23:05.126 --> 23:08.726
And so he descended
from the heavens to help them.

23:08.763 --> 23:11.033
According to Chinese myth,

23:11.065 --> 23:13.395
after ruling for 100 years,

23:13.434 --> 23:17.704
the Yellow Emperor called for
the return of the dragon.

23:17.738 --> 23:20.938
70 different people from his own staff

23:20.975 --> 23:25.475
all got on board this dragon
and flew away.

23:25.513 --> 23:27.553
The dragon is said
to travel vast distances

23:27.581 --> 23:29.381
in short periods of time.

23:29.416 --> 23:32.516
So the yellow dragon does appear to be

23:32.553 --> 23:33.953
a very large spacecraft,

23:33.988 --> 23:36.358
traveling at extraordinary speed,

23:36.390 --> 23:39.060
and all of the events
that I'm describing to you

23:39.093 --> 23:42.533
actually did take place
in physical, tangible reality.

23:42.563 --> 23:47.203
Liquid mercury is such
an obscure substance.

23:47.234 --> 23:51.004
So how do we account
for both the ancient Aztecs

23:51.038 --> 23:54.438
and the Chinese
creating rivers of mercury

23:54.475 --> 23:57.175
in the tombs of some of
their greatest figures,

23:57.211 --> 24:00.251
unless they know the hidden
secrets of the substance,

24:00.281 --> 24:03.751
hidden secrets that were taught
to them by extraterrestrials?

24:06.587 --> 24:09.317
Is it possible that the Aztec story

24:09.356 --> 24:11.516
of a flying feathered serpent

24:11.559 --> 24:12.929
and the Chinese story

24:12.960 --> 24:15.590
of a dragon coming down from the sky

24:15.629 --> 24:19.029
are both describing alien spacecraft?

24:21.669 --> 24:24.069
And is this why liquid mercury

24:24.104 --> 24:27.774
has been found in tombs
both in Mexico and China?

24:29.276 --> 24:32.276
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

24:32.313 --> 24:35.513
and propose even more
compelling evidence

24:35.549 --> 24:39.219
that our ancestors encountered
otherworldly technology

24:39.253 --> 24:43.093
might lie high in the mountains of Peru,

24:43.123 --> 24:46.123
hidden beneath the earth.

24:50.731 --> 24:54.331
Equipment detected that there was metal

24:54.368 --> 24:57.168
inside this hidden chamber.

24:57.204 --> 25:00.644
We're talking about
being able to recover the power

25:00.674 --> 25:02.914
that Pachacutec possessed.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.820
Machu Picchu, Peru.

25:12.561 --> 25:15.561
This stone citadel
of the Inca civilization

25:15.597 --> 25:18.397
was built high in the Andes Mountains

25:18.434 --> 25:20.774
around 1450 AD,

25:20.803 --> 25:24.443
but was suddenly
and mysteriously abandoned

25:24.473 --> 25:26.273
roughly a century later.

25:27.676 --> 25:29.736
Mainstream scholars contend

25:29.778 --> 25:31.748
the construction of Machu Picchu

25:31.780 --> 25:34.680
was led by Emperor Pachacutec

25:34.716 --> 25:36.446
and took thousands of men

25:36.485 --> 25:38.645
working decades to complete.

25:41.490 --> 25:43.760
But ancient astronaut theorists suggest

25:43.792 --> 25:46.092
that the precise construction,

25:46.128 --> 25:48.728
the transportation of massive blocks

25:48.764 --> 25:49.834
and the Incas' own accounts

25:49.865 --> 25:52.725
all point to a very different

25:52.768 --> 25:55.168
explanation for Machu Picchu:

25:55.204 --> 25:57.444
That it was built with the help

25:57.473 --> 25:59.973
of otherworldly beings.

26:00.008 --> 26:03.308
Emperor Pachacutec
was believed to have had

26:03.345 --> 26:05.905
a special bond with the god Viracocha.

26:05.948 --> 26:09.818
Pachacutec, in the days leading up

26:09.852 --> 26:12.422
to the great battle against the Chanka,

26:12.454 --> 26:14.294
he takes kind of a retreat.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.023
He goes to a lake.

26:16.058 --> 26:20.488
And out of the sky drops
this piece of metal

26:20.562 --> 26:22.862
into the lake.

26:22.898 --> 26:26.098
When he fishes it out
of the lake, it's a mirror.

26:26.134 --> 26:28.474
And he sees an image in the mirror.

26:30.072 --> 26:33.442
This supernatural creature
in the mirror tells him,

26:33.475 --> 26:35.135
"I am your father.

26:35.177 --> 26:38.277
"You will win many battles
in your lifetime,

26:38.313 --> 26:39.953
this one included."

26:39.982 --> 26:43.722
The image is actually
Viracocha, the creator deity.

26:43.752 --> 26:46.822
And then as Pachacutec stood

26:46.855 --> 26:49.355
with his vastly smaller army,

26:49.391 --> 26:52.731
these giant megalithic stones
came to life

26:52.761 --> 26:55.731
and became his army,
and crushed the Chanka.

26:57.833 --> 27:02.673
Pachacutec actually had the
power of Viracocha behind him.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.274
It makes one wonder

27:04.306 --> 27:07.336
if, in fact, this was
extraterrestrial technology.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.206
Could the story

27:09.244 --> 27:13.684
of Pachacutec levitating
massive stones be true?

27:13.715 --> 27:16.545
And might the mirror
that fell from the sky

27:16.585 --> 27:19.745
have been some type of alien technology?

27:19.788 --> 27:23.658
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes

27:23.692 --> 27:28.162
and suggest a new discovery
at Machu Picchu may reveal

27:28.196 --> 27:31.426
what happened to this
otherworldly device.

27:33.435 --> 27:36.335
French engineer David Crespy
was vacationing

27:36.371 --> 27:40.341
in Machu Picchu in 2010,
when he discovered

27:40.375 --> 27:42.505
that at the bottom of one
of the main buildings,

27:42.544 --> 27:45.284
there seemed to be a doorway,

27:45.314 --> 27:48.014
purposely sealed up with rocks.

27:48.050 --> 27:52.020
In August of 2011, he reached out

27:52.054 --> 27:56.094
to Thierry Jamin, a French archaeologist

27:56.124 --> 27:59.334
that has been studying Peru
and the Incan Empire

27:59.361 --> 28:01.631
for more than 15 years.

28:01.663 --> 28:03.463
Within a month,

28:03.498 --> 28:06.468
Thierry started his own investigation

28:06.501 --> 28:10.771
with local archaeologists and
specialists in funerary sites.

28:10.806 --> 28:14.206
Thierry and radar technician
Ricardo Hamada

28:14.242 --> 28:17.712
took a scan from above
the blocked entrance

28:17.746 --> 28:19.676
with ground-penetrating radar.

28:19.715 --> 28:24.515
The image on the radar detector
reveals a large cavity,

28:24.553 --> 28:27.953
and the broken lines indicate
there may also be stairs

28:27.990 --> 28:32.830
leading even further
down into the earth.

28:32.861 --> 28:35.801
Other equipment detected

28:35.831 --> 28:40.401
that there was metals
inside this hidden chamber.

28:40.435 --> 28:43.295
Gold, silver,

28:43.338 --> 28:46.408
and other types of metallic objects,

28:46.441 --> 28:48.311
suggesting very strongly

28:48.343 --> 28:52.583
that we're dealing
with some kind of a tomb.

28:52.614 --> 28:56.684
Although Thierry has
confirmed Crespy's suspicions

28:56.718 --> 28:59.248
that the odd structure was an entrance

28:59.287 --> 29:02.417
sealed off at some point by the Incas,

29:02.457 --> 29:05.287
the Peruvian authorities
have since banned his return

29:05.327 --> 29:08.457
to the site for further investigations.

29:10.365 --> 29:12.165
All of the iconographic

29:12.200 --> 29:14.770
and archaeological elements show us

29:14.803 --> 29:16.103
that this is all associated

29:16.138 --> 29:20.408
with the mausoleum of Pachacutec.

29:20.442 --> 29:23.542
Maybe the most important
archaeological treasure

29:23.578 --> 29:26.508
ever found in Machu Picchu.

29:26.548 --> 29:29.618
Could the tomb of Pachacutec

29:29.651 --> 29:32.091
lie beyond these rocks?

29:32.120 --> 29:36.520
And is it possible, as ancient
astronaut theorists suggest,

29:36.558 --> 29:40.588
that it might also contain
advanced technology,

29:40.629 --> 29:44.559
the so-called "magic mirror"
that was said to have been given

29:44.599 --> 29:47.929
to Pachacutec by the
creator god Viracocha?

29:50.005 --> 29:53.005
We're talking about
the emperor as having

29:53.041 --> 29:55.911
a connection with this
extraterrestrial being.

29:57.479 --> 29:58.609
Now think about it.

29:58.647 --> 30:00.807
If-if we're talking about recovering

30:00.849 --> 30:03.579
his tomb and his artifacts,

30:03.618 --> 30:05.988
then we're talking
about ultimately being able

30:06.021 --> 30:09.591
to recover the power
that Pachacutec possessed.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.493
And what we're going to be
seeing here is, I believe,

30:14.529 --> 30:16.759
ironclad evidence emerging

30:16.798 --> 30:20.798
of extraterrestrial
involvement in human affairs.

30:20.836 --> 30:22.836
When the underground chamber

30:22.871 --> 30:25.841
found at Machu Picchu is excavated,

30:25.874 --> 30:28.914
will we discover undeniable proof

30:28.944 --> 30:30.684
that this site was constructed

30:30.712 --> 30:33.112
with extraterrestrial technology?

30:33.148 --> 30:36.048
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest

30:36.084 --> 30:38.524
further evidence can be found

30:38.553 --> 30:42.023
by examining newly
discovered Nazca Lines

30:42.057 --> 30:44.687
as well as similar geoglyphs

30:44.726 --> 30:47.556
found on the other side of the world.

30:52.067 --> 30:53.867
They're much more complex

30:53.902 --> 30:55.142
than the Nazca geoglyphs

30:55.170 --> 30:57.040
in that they are three-dimensional.

30:57.072 --> 30:58.472
This could've been

30:58.507 --> 31:02.637
some huge, great,
megalithic stone setting.

31:07.775 --> 31:09.505
Nazca, Peru.

31:10.911 --> 31:13.651
First discovered in 1927,

31:13.680 --> 31:16.010
the Nazca Lines consist

31:16.049 --> 31:18.319
of hundreds of designs
known as geoglyphs,

31:18.352 --> 31:21.092
that can only be seen from above.

31:22.956 --> 31:24.956
Scattered over 200 square miles

31:24.992 --> 31:27.232
in southern Peru,

31:27.261 --> 31:30.761
mainstream archaeologists
believe the figures were created

31:30.798 --> 31:32.298
by the ancient Nazca people

31:32.332 --> 31:36.272
sometime between the first
and eighth centuries AD.

31:37.671 --> 31:39.241
Ancient astronaut theorists

31:39.273 --> 31:42.943
have been studying
the Nazca Lines for years.

31:42.976 --> 31:45.306
and they say new evidence proves

31:45.345 --> 31:48.245
that aliens not only visited Nazca,

31:48.282 --> 31:51.722
but continued to return there
over the centuries.

31:54.087 --> 31:57.917
On July 7, 2015,

31:57.958 --> 32:02.058
a team of anthropologists from
Yamagata University in Japan

32:02.095 --> 32:05.855
revealed they had found new Nazca lines

32:05.899 --> 32:08.729
that, due to erosion,
are impossible to make out

32:08.769 --> 32:10.069
with the naked eye.

32:11.738 --> 32:12.898
By conducting

32:12.940 --> 32:14.910
a three-dimensional scan of the ground,

32:14.942 --> 32:18.142
they uncovered a total of 24 images,

32:18.178 --> 32:21.778
including strange-looking
humanoid figures,

32:21.815 --> 32:26.645
a disembodied head
and a llama 65 feet long.

32:29.022 --> 32:31.362
According to their findings,

32:31.391 --> 32:35.761
the new geoglyphs date
from 400 to 200 BC,

32:35.796 --> 32:38.196
making them hundreds of years older

32:38.232 --> 32:41.232
than those previously discovered.

32:41.268 --> 32:45.068
These new finds are
instrumental in showing

32:45.105 --> 32:48.935
the duration of which these
types of modifications

32:48.976 --> 32:50.936
were going on, on the desert floor,

32:50.978 --> 32:52.838
for hundreds and hundreds of years,

32:52.880 --> 32:55.150
involving different cultures,

32:55.182 --> 32:58.222
with different motivations
and different depictions.

32:58.252 --> 33:01.692
It would seem to be all of the cultures

33:01.722 --> 33:05.122
were trying to signal
some kind of sky people

33:05.158 --> 33:09.288
and probably, over time, were trying

33:09.329 --> 33:12.199
to induce them to come
back down from the sky

33:12.232 --> 33:14.632
and land their ships.

33:14.668 --> 33:16.328
You have to wonder then if,

33:16.370 --> 33:19.740
with at least four successive
cultures doing this,

33:19.773 --> 33:23.943
that you would think
they must have had some success.

33:23.977 --> 33:28.807
Some ancient astronaut
theorists have even suggested

33:28.849 --> 33:32.849
that the discovery of older
Nazca lines may indicate

33:32.886 --> 33:35.916
that the people responsible
for the later geoglyphs

33:35.956 --> 33:38.316
were imitating what was originally made

33:38.358 --> 33:41.928
by the extraterrestrials themselves.

33:41.962 --> 33:43.732
So the question starts to rise is:

33:43.764 --> 33:47.804
were various different
people coming to Nazca

33:47.834 --> 33:50.804
to make these petroglyphs
and these large diagrams?

33:50.837 --> 33:54.167
Or were they possibly recreating
some initial experiment

33:54.207 --> 33:58.777
or some initial thing that took place?

33:58.812 --> 34:00.812
What if some of the early
cultures in Nazca

34:00.847 --> 34:03.877
actually experienced
interaction with beings

34:03.917 --> 34:07.817
that were creating edifices that
can only be seen from the sky,

34:07.854 --> 34:10.024
and the only way to get
to lure them back

34:10.056 --> 34:12.217
was to create these ways to communicate

34:12.259 --> 34:13.929
from an aerial perspective?

34:16.429 --> 34:18.360
For decades, it was thought

34:18.398 --> 34:22.027
that there was no other place
on Earth like Nazca,

34:22.069 --> 34:25.668
but recently, a shocking
discovery was made

34:25.706 --> 34:28.906
on the opposite side of the globe.

34:28.942 --> 34:31.141
Turgay, Kazakhstan.

34:31.178 --> 34:33.748
October, 2015.

34:35.449 --> 34:37.418
Using satellite photography,

34:37.451 --> 34:40.190
NASA captures images

34:40.219 --> 34:42.290
of more than 260 geoglyphs

34:42.322 --> 34:43.922
covering the ground here.

34:45.859 --> 34:49.929
They're located in
a very rural part of Kazakhstan

34:49.963 --> 34:53.333
and they could only be found
thanks to modern technology.

34:53.367 --> 34:56.937
They are much more complex
than the Nazca geoglyphs

34:56.969 --> 34:59.370
in that they are three-dimensional.

34:59.406 --> 35:02.236
They are mounds and trenches,

35:02.275 --> 35:04.035
whereas the Nazca Lines

35:04.077 --> 35:06.337
are etchings in the sand.

35:06.380 --> 35:08.750
We're talking here

35:08.782 --> 35:10.952
about massive features

35:10.984 --> 35:14.094
that are constructed from earthen mounds

35:14.121 --> 35:15.721
and also from wood,

35:15.756 --> 35:20.886
showing everything
from rings, to squares,

35:20.927 --> 35:24.957
to crosses and even swastikas
that are on the ground.

35:28.168 --> 35:31.598
The archaeologists
in the area have no idea

35:31.638 --> 35:35.538
who made the geoglyphs
or what they represent.

35:35.575 --> 35:38.875
But one fact they have
been able to determine

35:38.912 --> 35:43.312
is that some of these glyphs
date back 8,000 years--

35:43.350 --> 35:46.790
nearly 6,000 years older

35:46.820 --> 35:50.360
than the Nazca lines.

35:50.390 --> 35:53.430
Since these can be dated
to almost 8,000 years old,

35:53.460 --> 35:56.390
we have to wonder who they were
trying to communicate with.

35:56.430 --> 35:58.200
Could it have been, possibly,

35:58.231 --> 36:03.171
what a lot of these ancient
cultures referred to as gods?

36:03.203 --> 36:05.373
I think the fact that we're finding

36:05.405 --> 36:07.965
more and more of these symbols

36:08.008 --> 36:12.438
simply tell us that
the humankind, at that time,

36:12.479 --> 36:14.479
tried to communicate with

36:14.514 --> 36:16.884
what they thought
were the gods from above.

36:19.820 --> 36:21.150
Could the new geoglyphs

36:21.188 --> 36:23.018
found in Kazakhstan

36:23.056 --> 36:25.386
be evidence that
our ancestors encountered

36:25.425 --> 36:30.855
extraterrestrial visitors
as much as 8,000 years ago?

36:30.897 --> 36:34.027
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

36:34.067 --> 36:38.667
and suggest that these glyphs
may prove to have been made

36:38.705 --> 36:42.235
at the same time as the newly
discovered Superhenge...

36:43.944 --> 36:46.414
...because, while Stonehenge
is considered to be

36:46.446 --> 36:49.276
at least 5,000 years old,

36:49.316 --> 36:52.846
some believe the buried
monoliths of Superhenge

36:52.886 --> 36:55.516
could be much, much older.

36:55.555 --> 36:59.715
Stonehenge is only one small part

36:59.760 --> 37:03.390
of a gigantic archeological puzzle.

37:03.430 --> 37:06.360
Now, we, today,

37:06.399 --> 37:09.129
we must stumble
over these stone circles,

37:09.169 --> 37:10.639
over these stone lines.

37:10.670 --> 37:13.070
And automatically,
we have to ask questions:

37:13.106 --> 37:14.336
What is it?

37:14.374 --> 37:16.314
How have they done it?

37:16.343 --> 37:17.943
For what purpose?

37:17.978 --> 37:21.048
And sooner or later,
we came up with the question:

37:21.081 --> 37:23.921
Is there maybe a message
by the extraterrestrials?

37:27.287 --> 37:28.647
Is it possible

37:28.688 --> 37:31.388
that the geoglyphs recently discovered

37:31.424 --> 37:32.924
in Nazca and Kazakhstan

37:32.959 --> 37:34.989
are tied to not only

37:35.028 --> 37:36.998
the new discovery
of Superhenge in England,

37:37.030 --> 37:41.500
but also to other mysterious
sites around the world

37:41.535 --> 37:44.065
that were made to be seen from the sky?

37:46.039 --> 37:49.009
If so, could evidence that these markers

37:49.042 --> 37:52.082
were intended for
extraterrestrial visitors

37:52.112 --> 37:53.852
be hidden beneath the earth

37:53.880 --> 37:58.650
in Mexico, Peru, China and Egypt?

37:58.685 --> 38:02.245
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

38:02.289 --> 38:04.519
and suggest that we are on the verge

38:04.558 --> 38:09.028
of uncovering the ultimate proof
of alien contact.

38:13.908 --> 38:16.538
Ancient astronaut theorists argue

38:16.578 --> 38:19.548
that in recent times, the mainstream

38:19.581 --> 38:21.011
has dismissed the possibility

38:21.049 --> 38:23.579
that another race of advanced beings

38:23.618 --> 38:26.988
came to Earth in the distant past,

38:27.021 --> 38:30.521
even though the signs are all around us.

38:30.558 --> 38:34.458
Experts believe
a series of mysterious objects

38:34.496 --> 38:36.056
surrounding a giant star

38:36.097 --> 38:38.897
could be, Mark, an alien megastructure.

38:38.933 --> 38:40.503
1,500 light years from Earth,

38:40.535 --> 38:42.065
signals are blasting

38:42.103 --> 38:46.743
from the star KIC-84-62-85-2.

38:46.775 --> 38:48.535
It could be a... giant solar panels

38:48.576 --> 38:50.576
built by an alien civilization.

38:50.612 --> 38:52.612
Thousands of miles away

38:52.647 --> 38:55.647
in a cave in South Africa,
archaeologists discovered

38:55.683 --> 38:58.623
hundreds of ancient bones
and a new human ancestor.

38:58.653 --> 39:02.363
As more and more new evidence pours in,

39:02.390 --> 39:05.020
is ancient astronaut theory
nearing a point

39:05.059 --> 39:08.129
where it will be considered
by mainstream scholars

39:08.163 --> 39:12.003
as a serious possibility?

39:12.033 --> 39:13.533
Great thinkers like Galileo

39:13.568 --> 39:16.438
are dismissed as fools and heretics.

39:16.471 --> 39:18.571
They were the ones
that had the right idea,

39:18.606 --> 39:20.706
but new ideas are not accepted easily.

39:22.143 --> 39:23.983
For centuries, it was believed

39:24.012 --> 39:26.212
that the Earth was flat.

39:26.247 --> 39:27.607
We are a stubborn people.

39:29.017 --> 39:31.217
As we evolve as a humankind,

39:31.252 --> 39:34.492
we are going to realize that
what we were taught in the past

39:34.522 --> 39:36.992
may not be what is
going to be in the future.

39:38.693 --> 39:40.433
We're gonna continue to learn

39:40.462 --> 39:44.102
new things about past civilizations,

39:44.132 --> 39:46.172
and new things of what could've been

39:46.201 --> 39:48.571
future civilizations, as well.

39:48.603 --> 39:51.603
And you've got to conclude

39:51.639 --> 39:53.669
that we are not alone in the universe,

39:53.708 --> 39:55.608
and that we've been visited,

39:55.643 --> 39:57.743
and we continue to be visited.

39:57.779 --> 40:01.009
With the technology that has been

40:01.049 --> 40:03.649
and is being developed at the moment,

40:03.685 --> 40:08.245
ultimately, archaeology
will have no other choice

40:08.289 --> 40:10.189
but to accept the fact

40:10.225 --> 40:13.025
that we have been visited
by extraterrestrials

40:13.061 --> 40:16.161
in the remote past.

40:16.197 --> 40:19.667
For me, personally, I think that
these extraterrestrials,

40:19.701 --> 40:22.031
they left a purpose.

40:22.070 --> 40:24.540
I call it something like a time capsule.

40:24.572 --> 40:27.372
That's why they made

40:27.408 --> 40:30.538
these gigantic stone circles
and stone lines.

40:30.578 --> 40:33.608
It was addressed to us.

40:33.648 --> 40:36.578
And we should ask, who were
these extraterrestrials?

40:36.618 --> 40:38.518
Where did they come from?

40:38.553 --> 40:39.623
What was the reason?

40:39.654 --> 40:42.054
Will they come down again?

40:42.090 --> 40:44.990
I'm sure they will show up.

40:45.026 --> 40:48.226
We are now living in a paradigm shift

40:48.263 --> 40:50.633
in which the new evidence is upholding

40:50.665 --> 40:53.025
an older and ancient idea

40:53.067 --> 40:55.997
that extraterrestrials came to Earth

40:56.037 --> 40:59.467
and had a huge influence
on human affairs.

40:59.507 --> 41:01.367
And that ultimately, our future depends

41:01.409 --> 41:03.139
on our involvement
with these beings, as well.

41:05.747 --> 41:08.947
As technology continues to improve,

41:08.983 --> 41:11.683
will irrefutable evidence be uncovered

41:11.719 --> 41:14.819
of extraterrestrial
intervention on Earth?

41:16.524 --> 41:18.694
Evidence that world governments

41:18.726 --> 41:21.486
have been hiding from us for decades?

41:21.529 --> 41:24.399
Could the smoking gun be concealed

41:24.432 --> 41:26.702
behind a tomb wall,

41:26.734 --> 41:29.944
hidden away in an ancient temple,

41:29.971 --> 41:33.641
or even buried right under our feet?

41:33.675 --> 41:38.235
If otherworldly beings
really have been observing us,

41:38.279 --> 41:41.479
perhaps as we get closer to the truth,

41:41.516 --> 41:45.646
the proof will come not in
the form of an artifact

41:45.687 --> 41:47.717
or scientific discovery,

41:47.755 --> 41:50.715
but in face-to-face contact

41:50.758 --> 41:53.658
with our alien ancestors.
