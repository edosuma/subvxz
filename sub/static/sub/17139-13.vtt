WEBVTT

00:02.040 --> 00:05.249
Let me paint you a picture
of a world without monsters, or demons,

00:05.440 --> 00:07.920
<i>of a world where no one has to die
because of the supernatural,</i>

00:08.039 --> 00:09.769
of a new world, a better world.

00:09.920 --> 00:10.921
I'm listening.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.770
You have no hold over me.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.850
ABADDON: <i>Gavin, honey. Say hello to Daddy.</i>

00:16.120 --> 00:17.770
- How did you...
- I know a spell or two, Crowley.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.126
You get that he's gotta go back, right?

00:19.280 --> 00:22.409
His destiny is to board a ship
bound for America.

00:22.680 --> 00:25.729
That ship went down in a storm.
All hands were lost.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.406
You change any one thing in the past,

00:28.600 --> 00:31.126
<i>the ripple effect impacts
everything that follows.</i>

00:32.280 --> 00:33.281
DEAN: Damn it, Crowley!

00:33.440 --> 00:34.930
<i>What the hell is a Prince of Hell?</i>

00:35.080 --> 00:38.084
The oldest of the old demons.
Lucifer turned them himself.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.850
They were trained to be generals,

00:40.000 --> 00:42.128
to lead demonic armies
in the war against Heaven.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.287
MARY: <i>Like Azazel?</i>

00:43.480 --> 00:44.481
CROWLEY: <i>They even have his eyes.</i>

00:44.640 --> 00:46.608
- You have any idea who we are?
- I don't care.

00:46.760 --> 00:47.841
<i>I don't care who you are.</i>

00:48.000 --> 00:50.241
I don't even care that Lucifer's
got a bun in the oven.

00:50.480 --> 00:54.724
- MARY: You know about that?
- My sister, Dagon, has taken an interest.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.401
Oh...

03:11.000 --> 03:14.129
Okay, well, stay on it.
You get any leads, you let us know,

03:14.280 --> 03:16.647
and we'll keep working it from our end.
Thanks, Cass.

03:17.960 --> 03:20.247
So, Kelly Kline is in the wind.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.401
- No trace.
- Great.

03:21.720 --> 03:24.326
And no idea when Lucifer's kid
is gonna pop, if it hasn't already.

03:24.640 --> 03:27.325
- So, basically, we got nothing.
- Basically.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.762
All right.
Well, we do have this other thing.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.690
- What other thing?
- Check it out.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.325
Museum in Des Moines, Iowa.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.767
Guy's body was found in the parking lot.
A teacher.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.160
His tongue had been ripped out.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.401
Well, that didn't kill him.

03:38.560 --> 03:41.530
No, but having his
internal organs crushed did.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.564
No obvious damage to the torso,
no point of entry...

03:44.720 --> 03:46.324
- You thinking witch?
- Maybe.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.881
I mean, he was seen alive
just a couple hours earlier,

03:49.080 --> 03:50.445
leading a student tour of the museum.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.601
DEAN: <i>Hmm.</i>

03:52.280 --> 03:54.521
Haven't seen Mom in a while.
Maybe she'll wanna work with us on this.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.370
Nice toy.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.365
Gets the job done.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.527
Hey, Dean.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.205
Nothing, just...

04:38.280 --> 04:40.044
I'm at a motel, outside Newark.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.244
<i>No, no special plans.</i>

04:42.400 --> 04:45.370
You know, pay-per-view, Magic Fingers,
the ushe.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.123
Oh, it's so sweet of you to think of me.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.285
Tongue ripped out. Wow.

04:52.880 --> 04:53.927
I, uh...

04:54.320 --> 04:57.688
I'm actually still sort of resting up
after that whole Ramiel thing,

04:57.880 --> 04:59.769
but if you need me...

05:01.640 --> 05:02.687
<i>You sure?</i>

05:04.840 --> 05:06.046
Okay, rain check.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.411
Hey, I love you.

05:12.160 --> 05:14.731
You're an excellent liar, Mary.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.161
I haven't told my sons
I'm working with you.

05:22.080 --> 05:27.041
I gathered, and I understand.
Sam and Dean aren't our biggest fans.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.964
Yeah, because you tortured them.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.282
- We've been through that.
- Right.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.763
It wasn't you,
it was your "rogue operative."

05:35.080 --> 05:36.320
Exactly.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.001
So...

05:40.720 --> 05:41.721
Drink?

05:44.400 --> 05:46.084
You'll resist, at first.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.967
The humiliation will eat at you.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.288
Until, finally,

05:55.080 --> 05:56.889
you're worn down

05:57.440 --> 05:59.283
by your utter helplessness.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.406
And you

06:04.160 --> 06:07.209
<i>will call me master.</i>

06:09.000 --> 06:11.651
You brag of your superior power.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.007
Well, genius trumps brute force.

06:16.520 --> 06:20.844
<i>I've had a dozen of my most loyal studying
the Cage where you were held,</i>

06:21.320 --> 06:22.731
<i>at the molecular level.</i>

06:23.760 --> 06:25.808
They managed to replicate the material,

06:26.000 --> 06:27.604
they made those chains.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.124
Getting you here,
well, that was a different matter.

06:32.440 --> 06:33.601
Crowley, still not helping.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.642
Listen, we know
what we're talking about, here.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.082
<i>We have been on Lucifer's trail
for a long time.</i>

06:40.320 --> 06:44.166
CROWLEY: <i>Everybody in that room
was obviously focused on</i>

06:44.360 --> 06:47.125
<i>sending you back using Mother's spell.</i>

06:48.320 --> 06:50.482
<i>Everybody except yours truly.</i>

06:52.480 --> 06:53.606
Rowena! Now!

06:59.480 --> 07:01.847
I managed to pervert that spell,

07:02.560 --> 07:06.963
<i>so your essence wasn't sent back
to the Cage, but instead...</i>

07:07.760 --> 07:10.570
<i>We found your discarded vessel
a few years ago.</i>

07:12.400 --> 07:13.481
<i>Repaired it.</i>

07:14.520 --> 07:15.726
<i>Improved it.</i>

07:16.680 --> 07:21.925
Making it a fitting final home
for the real you.

07:25.880 --> 07:26.881
What?

07:27.880 --> 07:31.043
No snarky, devilish comments?

07:34.520 --> 07:36.010
You have nothing to say?

07:38.360 --> 07:39.361
Thanks?

07:40.960 --> 07:43.042
I mean, all that effort...

07:44.720 --> 07:46.563
<i>So you could've had me back in the Cage,</i>

07:46.680 --> 07:49.809
but no,
you needed your sad, little revenge.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.722
How do you think this is going to end?

07:57.520 --> 07:59.204
Nice new digs, by the way.

08:00.520 --> 08:01.760
Cozy.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.087
SAM: Get this.
Looks like there was another murder.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.480
Just like the one we're checking up on.

08:07.760 --> 08:10.491
- Iowa?
- No, Andover, Massachusetts.

08:10.640 --> 08:11.971
Six months ago.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.123
A woman, body was found
in the same condition.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.481
Looks like she was a teacher, too.

08:15.720 --> 08:16.721
Hmm.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.244
Too bad Mom couldn't make it.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.882
- You said she was too tired?
- Yeah.

08:24.840 --> 08:25.921
What?

08:26.120 --> 08:27.121
I don't know. I just...

08:27.280 --> 08:29.851
I feel like something's going on with her,
and she ain't talking about it.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.049
Mom's hunting again.
It's a grind. You know that.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.760
She just needs a little time, Dean,
that's all.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.441
Yeah.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.367
Okay, you're in Mr. Peterson's van, guys.
Come on.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.969
I'll be back out in one minute.

10:09.680 --> 10:12.001
So, thank you again
for meeting with us, Dr. Ochoa.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.889
Of course, Agent, I...

10:15.240 --> 10:17.607
We've had two murders in two days.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.928
The police have no idea
what's going on, and...

10:20.080 --> 10:21.161
Well, that's why we're here.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.129
Well, you said victim number two
brought some.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.765
Timber Troopers through here, right?

10:24.920 --> 10:27.127
Sixteen hours ago, they were standing
right where you are.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.566
Is there anything new to the museum?

10:28.840 --> 10:31.047
Well, here in the lab,

10:31.320 --> 10:33.448
three traveling exhibits
had been uncrated.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.041
One's already on display,
the other two are being prepped.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.326
Dr. Ochoa?

10:39.080 --> 10:40.684
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

10:43.680 --> 10:47.048
Okay, so, including the Massachusetts vic,

10:47.480 --> 10:50.450
that is two teachers and one Scout leader.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.245
People who supervise kids.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.644
Whoa.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.128
There's a lot of action in here.
Okay, well...

10:57.400 --> 10:59.368
I'm switching my vote from witch to ghost.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.291
I don't know.
EMF isn't that surprising at a museum.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.768
They're always filled with ADHD spirits
and their tethers, you know.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.526
Okay, but if our killer
is a chain rattler,

11:08.680 --> 11:10.091
how are we gonna figure out
which one it is?

11:16.920 --> 11:18.046
Ready, honey?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.768
Uh, just some orange juice.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.169
Please. Small.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.488
So, when are you due?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.451
I have no idea.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.171
Well, take it from me.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.004
Before kids, your life is yours.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.322
Once they show up,
life as you know it is over.

11:38.560 --> 11:39.561
Yeah.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.529
Pretty sure that's the way
this is gonna go.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.444
But whenever it pops out,

11:43.920 --> 11:45.649
you're totally gonna love
the little devil.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.571
Hmm.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.726
Aztecs were pretty serious
about their killings.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.641
Aztec ghost. Yeah, I like that.

12:15.440 --> 12:16.726
What do you got?

12:17.640 --> 12:21.087
From a ship, a brigantine called The Star.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.925
"Sunk in a storm
off the New England coast."

12:24.160 --> 12:26.367
Currently on loan
from the Maritime Museum in,

12:26.560 --> 12:27.641
wait for it,

12:27.800 --> 12:29.165
Andover, Massachusetts.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.084
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:31.680 --> 12:34.331
Sunk in a storm in 1723...

12:35.200 --> 12:36.964
Wait a minute,
I know something about something.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.366
About this ship.

12:39.720 --> 12:43.406
Um, it was headed to the New World.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.649
- Weighed anchor in Leith, Scotland.
- Leith. Yes!

12:47.880 --> 12:49.211
Gavin MacLeod.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.525
- This was his ship.
- Crowley's kid?

12:51.840 --> 12:52.887
Yep.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.522
Ah... Oh, Oh...

13:01.880 --> 13:03.530
I'm sorry, it's just that...

13:05.040 --> 13:06.371
You actually...

13:06.880 --> 13:09.804
You seriously think this is gonna work?
It's just...

13:11.600 --> 13:13.204
It's so sad.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.244
Hope you like the taste of floor.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.201
Ow.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.643
There's a spot there, needs scrubbing.

13:24.680 --> 13:25.886
<i>And worse?</i>

13:26.200 --> 13:29.602
You're not even gonna see it coming,
when you get taken down.

13:29.800 --> 13:30.801
By you?

13:32.800 --> 13:34.689
- And my flesh and blood.
- Really?

13:35.760 --> 13:37.364
You remember the lovely

13:38.240 --> 13:39.241
Kelly Kline.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.561
She got rid of that thing.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.767
Did she, now?

13:42.080 --> 13:43.491
The Winchesters saw to it.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.524
Because they can always be trusted.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.410
It was in their own self-interest.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.761
Huh.

13:48.920 --> 13:49.921
Interesting.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.009
Because I can still feel it.

13:53.560 --> 13:54.607
Its heart.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.925
Its power.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.690
Sort of makes me proud.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.602
A chip off the old ball of heavenly light,

14:02.760 --> 14:04.444
if you know what I mean. Phone.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.445
<i>- What do you want?</i>
Need a favor.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.602
You? Need?

14:12.400 --> 14:13.606
<i>You?</i>

14:14.480 --> 14:15.481
Turns out,

14:15.760 --> 14:18.081
<i>that behind that whole moron facade,</i>

14:18.280 --> 14:22.330
you and your brother are, in fact, morons.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.650
<i>You let Lucifer's love child live?</i>

14:26.800 --> 14:27.801
How do you even know about that?

14:28.040 --> 14:29.724
I don't owe you an explanation.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.888
Okay, so,
I'm guessing this isn't the best time

14:32.080 --> 14:34.924
to ask you to get in touch with Gavin
so we can talk to him?

14:35.120 --> 14:36.884
Are you out of your minds?

14:38.320 --> 14:41.642
You know what, Crowley? When you set
Gavin free to live in our time,

14:41.960 --> 14:44.645
and possibly screw up
the rest of human history,

14:44.800 --> 14:48.122
we didn't hunt him down, okay?
So, I think you owe us.

14:49.040 --> 14:53.807
You and Bullwinkle fix this mess
before it hatches.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.121
Then, maybe...

14:55.320 --> 14:57.721
Then, we'll talk about my son!

15:00.120 --> 15:01.804
Oh, my dad!

15:03.240 --> 15:07.006
I love that!
You and I, both single fathers.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.921
I could use a little dad advice
right about now.

15:11.240 --> 15:12.526
When do you let them date?

15:14.760 --> 15:16.205
No pushing, ladies.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.330
Let's be as polite on the bus
as we were in the museum.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.211
Class, no saving seats.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.166
- That means you, Coco.
- Fine.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.441
- No food on the bus, Sharon.
- Okay.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.520
Your little story's fascinating,

15:43.680 --> 15:45.762
but you said there was something
in this for me?

15:48.040 --> 15:49.690
If the killer is a ghost,

15:49.960 --> 15:51.803
it may be tethered to something
on the ship.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.567
So, we need intel on the vessel.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.370
Get a library card.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.761
You two still owe me
for helping you in Arkansas.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.161
Sit down.

16:09.360 --> 16:12.204
We know of a guy who has
firsthand knowledge of The Star.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.050
- So?
- DEAN: <i>So...</i>

16:14.320 --> 16:15.606
If you find him,

16:16.040 --> 16:18.441
we actually do have something
that you'll like.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.722
Like, really like.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.249
Who is this eyewitness?

17:21.319 --> 17:22.685
FEMALE DEMON: <i>Get away from her!</i>

17:24.079 --> 17:26.287
She's ours, demon. Orders!

17:26.560 --> 17:27.846
Not my problem.

17:37.920 --> 17:38.967
No.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.007
No.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.209
Come with me if you wanna live.

17:54.800 --> 17:58.247
I get it, you're freaked.
But take a breath.

17:58.920 --> 17:59.921
Chill.

18:01.480 --> 18:04.245
You made those people explode.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.329
Again, not people.

18:06.640 --> 18:07.846
And they were attacking you.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.284
And you said you were a demon.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.610
Titles. Labels.

18:12.840 --> 18:16.287
I'm a demon, you're Rosemary,
complete with baby.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.561
Please!

18:19.240 --> 18:20.366
You humans,

18:20.640 --> 18:23.166
you've been fed so much propaganda.

18:23.960 --> 18:26.440
What did they teach you
about Lucifer at Sunday School?

18:27.040 --> 18:29.520
Let me guess. Pitchforks? Horns?

18:31.080 --> 18:33.401
But did they mention he's an archangel?

18:33.840 --> 18:35.683
Once one of God's most trusted?

18:35.960 --> 18:37.291
What are you?

18:38.320 --> 18:39.606
I don't even know your name.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.690
Dagon. It's Dagon.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.045
<i>Look, what I'm saying is,</i>

18:44.360 --> 18:45.646
it ain't all black and white.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.330
Good versus evil.

18:48.080 --> 18:50.606
Those people who were trying to kill you?

18:52.400 --> 18:53.561
Angels.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.686
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

18:55.960 --> 18:57.769
Not quite the harps and halos
you thought.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.404
And why'd they want you dead?

19:01.440 --> 19:04.410
Because you're carrying an innocent child.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.286
<i>I know you're scared.</i>

19:07.480 --> 19:09.244
Don't believe what you see in the movies.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.609
No one is born good or bad,
it's all in the upbringing.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.126
This child...

19:14.760 --> 19:16.091
Your child...

19:17.280 --> 19:18.930
He could save us all.

19:20.240 --> 19:21.241
"He"?

19:22.200 --> 19:23.326
You didn't know?

19:24.520 --> 19:25.567
I...

19:26.040 --> 19:27.041
No.

19:27.600 --> 19:32.242
<i>Kelly, the angels? The Winchesters?
The good guys?</i>

19:33.440 --> 19:35.124
They want you dead.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.611
But I can protect you.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.888
I can protect your son.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.810
<i>You don't have to run anymore.</i>

19:56.600 --> 19:57.601
- There he is.
- Yes.

19:57.880 --> 19:58.927
Gavin!

20:00.440 --> 20:02.124
Hey, Gavin. Good to see you.

20:02.520 --> 20:04.488
How's life in the 21st century
treating you?

20:04.840 --> 20:06.001
Oh, fine.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.441
Where's my father, then?

20:08.800 --> 20:10.040
Walk with us, Gav.

20:10.440 --> 20:11.965
- How sick is he?
- About that...

20:12.160 --> 20:14.288
We might've exaggerated a little bit.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.970
Lied. We lied.

20:16.120 --> 20:19.203
Okay, well, we knew you wouldn't come
if it was just us.

20:19.720 --> 20:20.881
We need your help, Gavin.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.286
Help?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.086
- Help!
- No, no, we're fine.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.370
Just hear us out, please.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.284
How did you find...

20:29.440 --> 20:30.851
What are you going to do to me?

20:31.080 --> 20:32.809
Just wanna ask you a few questions.

20:33.640 --> 20:34.766
About this.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.328
Dear God, that's <i>The Star!</i>

20:39.520 --> 20:41.488
- That's my ship!
- Well, it should've been.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.971
Yeah, we know all about her.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.004
We figured there's someone
you'd wanna meet.

20:51.320 --> 20:52.685
Hello, Gavin.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.841
You look just like my father
when he was young.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.967
Gavin, meet Rowena.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.810
Your grandmother.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.931
My grandmother?

21:05.840 --> 21:07.046
She cannot be alive!

21:07.280 --> 21:09.282
Well, technically, dude, neither can you.

21:12.440 --> 21:13.726
Amazing.

21:14.880 --> 21:18.089
Father told me she'd gone down in a storm
and that was the end of her.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.967
The end of you, too, if you'd been aboard.

21:21.720 --> 21:23.688
Gavin, what can you tell us
about the other passengers

21:23.880 --> 21:25.166
who were supposed to make the crossing?

21:25.600 --> 21:26.761
Ordinary folk.

21:26.960 --> 21:31.124
Storekeepers, farmers, a doctor,
a teacher.

21:31.480 --> 21:32.686
A teacher?

21:33.400 --> 21:34.481
Aye.

21:34.800 --> 21:35.961
Mistress Allaway.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.168
She taught most of us in the village.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.327
Is this everything they found aboard?

21:41.640 --> 21:42.641
Yes.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.048
Let us know if you recognize anything.

21:45.720 --> 21:46.881
No.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.686
No.

21:49.320 --> 21:50.970
Oh, there's Mr. MacCallum's hook.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.444
Had no hand, you see.

21:55.760 --> 21:56.807
<i>No.</i>

21:58.440 --> 21:59.487
No.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.440
Oh, sweet Lord.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.209
- It's the locket.
- The locket?

22:07.320 --> 22:09.209
I bought it myself. It was a gift.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.046
<i>For my Fiona.</i>

22:11.760 --> 22:14.161
Darling, you had a wee girlfriend!

22:15.840 --> 22:18.446
Look at this.
Added to the exhibit six months ago.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.289
Fiona Duncan.

22:20.600 --> 22:21.761
The love of my life.

22:22.600 --> 22:26.605
When she found out I was going to America,
nothing would do but I take her with me.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.131
I told her it was too dangerous.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.361
How did it get here?

22:29.600 --> 22:32.046
If you didn't board the ship,
then she wouldn't have either, right?

22:32.240 --> 22:33.241
I don't know.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.885
That terrible night...

22:37.360 --> 22:38.646
<i>I was packing,</i>

22:38.960 --> 22:40.291
<i>ready to leave.</i>

22:41.000 --> 22:42.968
<i>Fiona said she was going to come see me,</i>

22:43.280 --> 22:45.567
<i>beg me one more time to take her along.</i>

22:51.320 --> 22:53.243
Obviously, I never made it to the ship.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.801
What's that you say?

22:56.280 --> 22:57.327
<i>"Come in"?</i>

22:57.600 --> 22:58.886
Don't mind if I do.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.723
If Fiona came that night, I was gone.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.009
And she would have thought
that you'd left without her.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.131
Dear God, she must
have smuggled herself aboard.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.483
Would she have really done
something like that?

23:12.640 --> 23:14.085
Iron will, that one.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.362
She'd have stayed hidden
until they were at sea

23:16.520 --> 23:17.806
and there was no turning back.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.367
And she would've died.
Pissed as hell and heartbroken.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.010
Yeah, unfinished business.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.766
We got ghost,
probably tethered to the locket.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.161
A ghost?

23:28.320 --> 23:30.084
My Fiona's a ghost?

23:31.800 --> 23:33.564
All right, where is this thing?

23:33.800 --> 23:35.131
Item 121.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.209
- One twenty-one? All right.
- Yeah.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.570
- Sam?
- What?

23:48.160 --> 23:49.321
It's gone.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.926
So...

24:08.840 --> 24:10.046
About that drink...

24:11.160 --> 24:12.525
I'm good, actually.

24:14.360 --> 24:15.725
Your sons...

24:17.360 --> 24:20.728
I'm sure they're fine lads and all,

24:20.880 --> 24:24.965
but it might be best if you were to

24:25.800 --> 24:28.371
disengage from them a bit.

24:28.760 --> 24:29.761
"Disengage"?

24:30.960 --> 24:31.961
This work,

24:32.680 --> 24:35.365
it's demanding, and it must come first.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.561
The Men of Letters is my family.

24:39.760 --> 24:40.807
I'm sorry.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.447
Nothing comes before my family.
Not with me.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.601
Really?

24:45.480 --> 24:47.960
Or is that just what you want to believe?

24:50.360 --> 24:52.727
You're different when you talk to them.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.121
<i>Soften.</i>

24:56.400 --> 24:57.606
Weaker.

24:59.480 --> 25:02.404
Not an insult, just an observation.

25:04.120 --> 25:06.566
But when you hunt, Mary,

25:08.600 --> 25:10.443
you're one of the best I've ever seen.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.286
I mean, you might play
at being the good mommy,

25:14.640 --> 25:16.404
but when you're in the thick of it,

25:16.560 --> 25:19.609
nothing but a blade in your hand
and blood in the air,

25:19.760 --> 25:21.410
that's the real you.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.643
The best you.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.970
<i>And I think you know it.</i>

25:29.280 --> 25:31.886
And I think that scares
the hell out of you.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.489
Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Ochoa.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.530
We've been looking through
the shipwreck exhibit

25:50.760 --> 25:51.761
in connection with the murders.

25:51.920 --> 25:53.888
- There seems to be an item missing.
- Yeah.

25:54.560 --> 25:57.928
Uh, it's right here. One twenty-one.
It's a locket.

26:00.280 --> 26:03.489
That's not possible.
It's in a sealed case.

26:03.720 --> 26:05.324
We know, ma'am.
But we've looked everywhere.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.641
It's definitely gone.

26:06.880 --> 26:10.123
Have one of those student tours been
through here in the last of couple days?

26:10.280 --> 26:11.361
The ones led by the teachers?

26:11.520 --> 26:14.444
- Yes. There was one yesterday.
- And where are they from?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.001
Uh...

26:20.840 --> 26:23.161
The Pembroke Day School for Girls.

26:30.560 --> 26:31.561
Oh.

26:31.800 --> 26:32.926
That's it for me.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.887
- How about a glass of wine?
- Oh, yeah.

26:36.400 --> 26:39.847
I read one more Internet bot paper
on <i>Bleak House,</i> I'll scream.

26:43.880 --> 26:44.881
Again?

26:45.560 --> 26:46.561
The panel?

28:40.320 --> 28:42.448
- Is it dead?
- Yeah. Has been for a long time.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.528
- What?
- It was a ghost.

28:44.760 --> 28:45.841
The rock salt only slowed it down.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.843
All right,
we gotta figure out if this was Fiona.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.850
So, show time.

28:58.760 --> 29:01.081
O restless spirit,

29:03.080 --> 29:05.811
make thy presence known to me.

29:13.480 --> 29:14.527
Fiona?

29:16.080 --> 29:17.889
It is I, Gavin.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.320
Your Gavin.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.323
I must speak with you.

29:48.360 --> 29:49.600
Fiona...

29:50.120 --> 29:51.167
Gavin.

29:55.120 --> 29:57.202
You abandoned me.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.087
You...

29:59.560 --> 30:00.766
Where were you?

30:02.240 --> 30:04.686
- I came to your room, I...
- It wasn't my fault.

30:05.160 --> 30:06.889
I was sent somewhere else.

30:07.400 --> 30:11.962
I hid myself aboard The Star,
and you weren't there to protect me.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.326
The crew...

30:13.680 --> 30:15.489
They came to scorn me,

30:15.880 --> 30:17.086
and mock me,

30:17.720 --> 30:18.926
and worse.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.924
Use me in a way no woman should be used.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.004
The other passengers...

30:26.960 --> 30:28.200
Did no one help you?

30:28.440 --> 30:29.771
All did nothing.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.684
And Mistress Allaway,

30:33.400 --> 30:34.765
our teacher,

30:35.360 --> 30:38.443
she said I deserved it
for throwing myself at you!

30:41.200 --> 30:42.361
Teachers...

30:42.600 --> 30:44.807
They claim to love children,

30:45.880 --> 30:47.769
and then they betray them.

30:48.280 --> 30:52.001
I couldn't punish her,
but others will pay her debt.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.931
Her life aboard that ship
was so unbearable,

31:01.080 --> 31:03.367
she felt death would be a relief.

31:03.880 --> 31:05.723
But the sweet maid I knew is now

31:06.040 --> 31:08.281
a spirit, bent on revenge.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.881
So, we agree Fiona has to be stopped?

31:11.400 --> 31:13.801
We can't burn her bones.
They're at the bottom of the Atlantic.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.481
Could destroy the locket.

31:15.680 --> 31:18.490
Then again, she might also be tethered
to something else on the ship.

31:18.640 --> 31:21.689
Either way, nothing can bring back
the poor people she killed.

31:26.680 --> 31:27.761
Actually,

31:27.920 --> 31:32.244
there might be a way to fix
pretty much everything.

31:32.720 --> 31:33.801
What?

31:35.600 --> 31:36.726
Keep Fiona

31:37.440 --> 31:39.169
from going Casper in the first place.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.006
SAM: <i>Yeah.</i>

31:41.320 --> 31:44.244
There's no reason for her to be a ghost
if she's not angry

31:44.520 --> 31:47.126
and alone on the ship.

31:47.320 --> 31:50.085
You don't intend to tamper
with the flow of time, do you?

31:50.480 --> 31:51.606
That's up to Gavin.

31:54.160 --> 31:57.050
Look, we're looking for a fix here, okay?
This is it.

31:57.400 --> 31:58.925
Get him aboard that ship.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.442
He travels with Fiona, keeps her safe.

32:01.760 --> 32:03.524
And go to his death! That's your solution?

32:03.680 --> 32:06.604
I didn't say it was the fun one, okay?
Just the one. And you know it.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.524
And it would keep history intact.

32:11.720 --> 32:15.008
I was thinking the same thing.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.681
I loved her.

32:18.360 --> 32:19.521
She loved me.

32:19.920 --> 32:22.161
<i>That's the only reason
any of this happened.</i>

32:23.120 --> 32:26.249
I can spare her the nightmare
she's trapped in.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.323
Can't say I ever fit here.

32:31.360 --> 32:32.646
<i>Here, I'm alone.</i>

32:33.360 --> 32:34.521
Fiona and me,

32:35.400 --> 32:37.528
we'll spend eternity together.

32:38.360 --> 32:39.486
CROWLEY: <i>Never gonna happen.</i>

32:42.960 --> 32:45.770
Just because Dim and Dimmer here
can't keep their own family

32:45.920 --> 32:47.251
all in the same dimension,

32:47.520 --> 32:48.806
doesn't mean they can mess with mine!

32:49.000 --> 32:51.571
Father, I want to do this.

32:51.840 --> 32:54.411
What you want is a gym membership,

32:55.000 --> 32:57.241
happy hour at Hooters and Cubs tickets.

32:58.080 --> 33:00.287
None of which are available anywhere else
but here.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.405
I've made up my mind.

33:05.560 --> 33:06.891
Then why did you call me?

33:07.440 --> 33:08.566
You called him?

33:10.480 --> 33:13.290
To say goodbye.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.085
Let him go, Fergus.

33:15.400 --> 33:16.686
Butt out.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.240
Fergus,

33:20.600 --> 33:21.931
he's not like us.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.084
He believes in things.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.481
Let him do what he believes is right.

33:41.080 --> 33:42.081
Mother.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.281
Damn you.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.011
I'm sorry, Father.

34:27.639 --> 34:28.766
Is that soup yet?

34:29.400 --> 34:30.606
Almost.

34:38.320 --> 34:39.400
You ready?

34:40.719 --> 34:41.880
Do it.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.291
Ready to do this, Gavin?

34:58.520 --> 35:00.045
You're positive this will work?

35:00.720 --> 35:01.801
Never done it before.

35:02.280 --> 35:04.521
But our granddad did. And Abaddon.

35:04.920 --> 35:07.287
And Rowena tweaked the spell
so that you could use it.

35:12.560 --> 35:15.040
All right, I think that's it.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.885
This is a tough one.

35:27.680 --> 35:29.125
You're a good guy, Gavin.

35:30.880 --> 35:31.881
Thank you.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.407
Hopefully,

35:36.800 --> 35:38.325
this is all for the best.

35:46.120 --> 35:47.485
Beam him up, Scotty.

36:36.120 --> 36:39.124
So, the teachers at the girls school
are all back to work.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.601
It's like nothing ever happened.
That's all the victims in Ohio.

36:43.720 --> 36:46.326
Well, no mention of
the Massachusetts murder, either.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.041
No Fiona, no angry ghost.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.170
Looks like history's back on track.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.085
Thank you, Gavin.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.963
- Well, well, well.
- Hey!

36:56.320 --> 36:57.651
It has been a while.

36:57.960 --> 37:02.124
A long, long, long, long, long, long,
long while.

37:02.480 --> 37:03.481
Yeah, all right.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.967
He's dramatic, as you know.
What he meant to say was,

37:06.240 --> 37:07.844
"We missed you." Glad you're back.

37:10.240 --> 37:12.129
Burgers. Beer.

37:13.280 --> 37:14.566
SAM: <i>Yum.</i>

37:15.000 --> 37:16.126
Forgiven.

37:16.720 --> 37:17.960
What you been up to?

37:18.480 --> 37:19.925
On.

37:20.200 --> 37:23.488
Jogging, Tai Chi, meditation...

37:24.560 --> 37:26.289
Melting Rugaru brains...

37:28.000 --> 37:30.480
Uh, melting Rugaru brains?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.809
There's no easy way to say it,
so I'm just gonna say it.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.411
I have sort of

37:40.640 --> 37:42.927
been working with
the British Men of Letters.

37:45.560 --> 37:48.006
You what?

37:50.360 --> 37:51.850
Uh...

37:53.360 --> 37:54.361
Mom,

37:55.840 --> 37:57.171
we, um...

37:57.840 --> 38:00.605
We have a history with them.

38:01.160 --> 38:02.889
I know, Sam.

38:04.160 --> 38:05.764
And it was a hard decision.

38:06.720 --> 38:09.200
<i>But they're doing good work.
I have helped them save people.</i>

38:09.360 --> 38:10.725
A lot of people.

38:11.520 --> 38:12.965
We can learn from them.

38:18.520 --> 38:20.010
Do not give me the face.

38:20.200 --> 38:21.406
- What face?
- You know the face.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.210
- There's no face.
- That's the face.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.803
Mom, we have got our own tool kit,

38:29.560 --> 38:31.528
and it works just fine.

38:31.880 --> 38:34.281
And for obvious reasons,

38:34.680 --> 38:38.730
like broken ribs and burned feet...

38:43.520 --> 38:45.010
We don't trust the Brits.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.649
So, where does that leave us?

38:58.080 --> 38:59.286
Same as always.

39:02.640 --> 39:03.880
Family.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.289
Just hear me out.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.686
Please?

39:28.720 --> 39:29.960
What you did...

39:30.240 --> 39:32.720
A low, even for you.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.967
It wasn't right.

39:37.240 --> 39:39.208
And you would know what's right.

39:39.720 --> 39:42.644
I know there's an ugly, rancid,

39:43.000 --> 39:46.129
spiteful reason why you sent my son,

39:46.760 --> 39:48.888
your grandson, to his death.

39:50.240 --> 39:51.765
I wanna know what it is.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.331
He was a lovely boy.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.925
<i>And in your own lizard way,
I know you cared for him.</i>

39:58.560 --> 40:00.608
Just as I cared for Oskar.

40:01.280 --> 40:02.441
Oskar.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.002
The child I loved more than you.

40:06.840 --> 40:10.162
The boy you made me kill
in order to remove the Mark of Cain.

40:18.920 --> 40:22.163
So that was all drivel you were spewing
about Gavin doing the right thing.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.605
It was the right thing.

40:25.160 --> 40:28.209
Maybe for Gavin, certainly for me.

40:28.520 --> 40:31.490
It allowed me to watch you suffer
the loss of a child.

40:33.320 --> 40:34.446
Payback.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.365
I'm your mother, dear.

40:36.520 --> 40:39.046
Who better to crush your shriveled heart?

41:47.440 --> 41:49.681
Dagon...
