00:23.192 --> 00:27.427
The average American now
carries 23 extra pounds.

00:27.489 --> 00:29.868
Heart disease and stroke
will claim the lives

00:29.888 --> 00:32.444
of 460,000 American women.

00:32.464 --> 00:34.573
69 grams of fat.

00:34.593 --> 00:36.761
You could actually save
12 grams of the fat

00:36.781 --> 00:38.113
and half the calories

00:38.133 --> 00:41.377
if you simply ate an
entire stick of butter.

00:41.397 --> 00:42.900
We're talking about diabetes

00:42.920 --> 00:46.046
and hypertension and bone
diseases, osteoporosis.

00:46.066 --> 00:49.225
Prostate cancer is now
the most common cancer

00:49.245 --> 00:50.399
in American men.

00:50.512 --> 00:54.033
Doctors say we really need to eat
less red and processed meat.

00:54.053 --> 00:56.514
And arterial
sclerosis and cancer

00:56.534 --> 00:57.904
and autoimmune disease.

00:57.924 --> 01:00.636
We have unprecedented amount of
type 2 diabetes in our children,

01:00.656 --> 01:02.279
and we're starting
to see hypertension

01:02.299 --> 01:04.891
in our children in
grammar school.

01:04.911 --> 01:09.413
In case you're wondering,
2,120 calories.

01:09.935 --> 01:12.514
Clearly the Western
diet is taking a toll.

01:12.534 --> 01:14.196
This should serve
as a wake-up call.

01:14.216 --> 01:15.802
We have a growing problem,

01:15.822 --> 01:18.487
and the ones who are
growing are us.

01:20.084 --> 01:24.553
Food! It's central to our
lives and traditions.

01:24.573 --> 01:28.157
Every special occasion seems
to involve food and feasting.

01:28.417 --> 01:30.608
But could some of
these same foods,

01:30.628 --> 01:33.463
including several that we think
are good for our health,

01:33.503 --> 01:36.987
also be causing many of our
most serious health problems?

01:37.007 --> 01:40.991
Indeed, we're facing a
massive health crisis.

01:41.011 --> 01:44.995
No less than 40% of
Americans today are obese,

01:45.015 --> 01:49.239
and about half of us are taking
some form of prescription drug.

01:49.259 --> 01:51.765
The best known statin
drug, Lipitor,

01:51.785 --> 01:54.450
is the most prescribed
drug ever in the world.

01:54.612 --> 01:57.595
Almost one in five
American four-year-olds

01:57.615 --> 01:59.597
are now considered to be obese.

01:59.617 --> 02:02.600
Though Mexican-Americans and
African-American children

02:02.620 --> 02:05.102
are still more likely
to be overweight.

02:05.122 --> 02:08.029
This could be the first
generation of children

02:08.125 --> 02:10.608
in the United States that
lives less than its parents.

02:11.343 --> 02:14.612
We spend 2.2 trillion dollars
a year on health care,

02:14.632 --> 02:19.116
over five times more
than the defense budget.

02:19.136 --> 02:21.619
In fact, we pay more per
person for health care

02:21.639 --> 02:24.121
than any industrialized
country in the world,

02:24.141 --> 02:26.624
yet we're sicker than ever.

02:26.644 --> 02:28.626
You see, there's no money
in healthy people,

02:28.646 --> 02:30.628
and there's no money
in dead people.

02:30.648 --> 02:34.131
The money is in the middle:
People who are alive, sort of,

02:34.151 --> 02:36.634
but with one or more
chronic conditions.

02:36.654 --> 02:39.136
Obesity, diabetes,
heart disease,

02:39.156 --> 02:40.292
high blood pressure

02:40.312 --> 02:43.388
are all diet-related
health issues

02:43.408 --> 02:49.832
that cost this country more
than $120 billion each year.

02:50.076 --> 02:52.149
Every minute, a person in the U.S.

02:52.169 --> 02:54.671
is killed by heart disease.

02:54.937 --> 02:58.155
1500 people a day
die from cancer.

02:58.175 --> 03:00.415
Combined, these
two diseases kill

03:00.435 --> 03:03.661
over 1 million
Americans every year.

03:04.149 --> 03:06.664
Cases of diabetes
are skyrocketing,

03:06.684 --> 03:09.166
particularly among our
younger population.

03:09.186 --> 03:10.398
- Diabetes.
- Diabetes.

03:10.418 --> 03:12.169
Life-threatening diabetes.

03:12.189 --> 03:14.247
One out of three people
born in the U.S. today

03:14.267 --> 03:17.675
will develop this crippling
condition during their lifetime.

03:17.695 --> 03:19.677
Millions of others suffer

03:19.697 --> 03:22.179
from a host of
degenerative diseases.

03:22.199 --> 03:25.182
Millions more of us are
so stimulated by sugar,

03:25.202 --> 03:27.184
coffee, and energy drinks

03:27.204 --> 03:30.187
that we've masked our
chronic fatigue.

03:30.207 --> 03:32.189
But could there be
a single solution

03:32.209 --> 03:33.691
to all of these problems?

03:33.711 --> 03:37.695
A solution so comprehensive,
yet so straightforward,

03:37.947 --> 03:39.871
that it's mind-boggling
that more of us

03:39.891 --> 03:41.699
haven't taken it seriously?

03:41.719 --> 03:44.679
Someone has to stand up
and say that the answer

03:44.699 --> 03:46.444
isn't another pill.

03:46.464 --> 03:48.706
The answer is spinach.

03:49.191 --> 03:51.152
A growing number of
researchers claim

03:51.172 --> 03:53.735
that if we eliminate,
or greatly reduce,

03:53.755 --> 03:56.334
refined, processed, and
animal-based foods,

03:56.513 --> 03:59.686
we can prevent and, in
certain cases, even reverse

03:59.837 --> 04:02.720
several of our worst diseases.

04:02.740 --> 04:05.845
They say all we need to do
is adopt a whole foods,

04:05.865 --> 04:07.224
plant-based diet.

04:07.244 --> 04:10.247
It sounds almost too
simple to be true.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.569
You might not expect
someone like me

04:24.589 --> 04:27.244
to explore the connection
between diet and disease.

04:27.596 --> 04:32.249
On my way over, I drank
these two Red Bulls.

04:32.704 --> 04:35.592
I also had a 12-ounce Coke

04:35.612 --> 04:37.987
and another half of
a 12-ounce Coke.

04:38.166 --> 04:39.256
I haven't always lived

04:39.276 --> 04:40.758
the healthiest lifestyle.

04:40.778 --> 04:43.761
And I've eaten more than
my share of fast food.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.551
But as part of my effort to
learn more about the link

04:46.571 --> 04:47.765
between food and health,

04:48.186 --> 04:50.660
I visited two physicians
in Los Angeles,

04:50.914 --> 04:53.771
Dr. Matt Lederman and
Dr. Alona Pulde.

04:53.791 --> 04:54.772
- Hi.
- How you doin'?

04:54.792 --> 04:56.273
- Lee Fulkerson.
- Lee, nice to meet you.

04:56.293 --> 04:57.274
Nice to meet you too.

04:57.294 --> 04:58.275
This is Dr. Pulde.

04:58.295 --> 05:01.278
Hi, Dr. Pulde.
Pleasure to meet you too.

05:01.298 --> 05:02.780
Both are M.Ds.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.268
Dr. Lederman was trained
in internal medicine

05:05.288 --> 05:07.534
and Dr. Pulde in family practice.

05:07.947 --> 05:10.788
They incorporate a whole
plant foods nutrition plan

05:10.808 --> 05:12.530
into the treatment
of their patients.

05:12.727 --> 05:14.564
So let's get started on that,

05:14.584 --> 05:15.827
and then we'll do some talking.

05:15.847 --> 05:17.186
142/82.

05:17.446 --> 05:19.672
I found out a lot
more than I expected.

05:20.179 --> 05:21.499
Like a lot of Americans,

05:21.621 --> 05:23.602
I thought my health
was pretty good.

05:23.821 --> 05:25.803
I had no major diseases
that I knew of.

05:26.713 --> 05:29.117
But I hadn't had a thorough
check-up in a while,

05:29.137 --> 05:30.917
so I decided to get one.

05:33.245 --> 05:35.414
When Dr. Lederman gave
me the results,

05:35.546 --> 05:37.100
it was a real wake-up call.

05:37.334 --> 05:39.817
I gotta say I'm kinda shocked.

05:39.837 --> 05:42.954
I'm really worried about
my blood work numbers.

05:43.311 --> 05:47.319
240 and 241 for my cholesterol

05:47.339 --> 05:49.067
is way higher than
it's ever been.

05:49.087 --> 05:51.328
I got this six number.

05:51.348 --> 05:54.832
That, to me, is the most
worrying number I got.

05:55.210 --> 05:56.579
The six number was the result

05:56.599 --> 05:58.836
of something called a CRP test,

05:59.154 --> 06:02.339
which measures the inflammation
in my heart and blood vessels.

06:02.664 --> 06:05.843
This put me in the high-risk
category for a heart attack.

06:06.359 --> 06:08.846
So I committed to a
12-week nutrition program

06:08.866 --> 06:10.868
under Dr. Lederman's supervision.

06:12.130 --> 06:14.289
The plan was to treat
my health problems

06:14.309 --> 06:17.116
by eating a whole foods,
plant-based diet.

06:25.213 --> 06:26.654
The idea of using nutrition

06:26.674 --> 06:28.866
to promote good health
is nothing new.

06:29.203 --> 06:30.761
Indeed, Hippocrates,

06:30.781 --> 06:33.153
the ancient Greek father
of Western medicine,

06:33.313 --> 06:37.792
said, "let food be thy medicine,"
over 2,000 years ago.

06:38.395 --> 06:40.215
Yet it wasn't until
more recently

06:40.235 --> 06:42.284
that the science behind
this observation

06:42.304 --> 06:44.539
was systematically
probed and applied.

06:46.581 --> 06:49.424
Two researchers who've made
groundbreaking contributions

06:49.444 --> 06:51.889
to this effort are Dr. Colin Campbell

06:52.379 --> 06:54.699
and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn.

06:55.913 --> 06:59.816
Born just a few months
apart in 1933 and '34,

07:00.004 --> 07:02.168
they each grew up on farms.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.728
Campbell's childhood farm
is in rural Virginia,

07:07.897 --> 07:11.909
where his family raised dairy
cattle and milked cows.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.721
My dad and mother
moved here in 1943

07:14.834 --> 07:16.413
when I was nine years old.

07:16.684 --> 07:18.916
And during that time,
we had a dairy of about

07:18.936 --> 07:21.077
somewheres between
20 and 30 cows,

07:21.199 --> 07:25.422
which in those days was a
modest, medium-sized dairy.

07:25.842 --> 07:27.925
At the time, milk
was believed to be

07:27.945 --> 07:29.729
nature's perfect food.

07:30.452 --> 07:33.311
So perfect, in fact, that this
U.S. government film

07:33.331 --> 07:35.933
from the early 20th century
recommended that infants

07:35.953 --> 07:37.935
who have just been weaned
from their mother's milk

07:38.259 --> 07:41.354
should be switched
immediately to cow's milk.

07:42.621 --> 07:44.942
That was the excitement
of doing something,

07:44.962 --> 07:47.444
producing nature's perfect
food, if you will.

07:48.317 --> 07:50.447
Established in 1675,

07:50.842 --> 07:53.470
the Esselstyn's farm is
in upstate New York.

07:54.417 --> 07:56.304
On these rolling hillsides,

07:56.324 --> 07:59.234
they grazed both beef
and dairy cattle.

07:59.476 --> 08:01.662
This was sort of like
the nerve center

08:01.682 --> 08:02.807
of the operation in a way?

08:02.827 --> 08:03.986
More or less, absolutely.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.561
This is sort of the epicenter,
around these barns.

08:06.581 --> 08:09.849
This is the way farming
was done in that era.

08:09.869 --> 08:11.468
And so this is sort
of where you learned

08:11.488 --> 08:12.970
the craft... the trade.

08:12.990 --> 08:14.471
The trade of farming.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.087
How old were you
when you moved here?

08:16.107 --> 08:16.974
Seven.

08:16.994 --> 08:18.598
I didn't start
driving the tractor

08:18.618 --> 08:19.848
till I was eight years old.

08:21.397 --> 08:22.980
A late bloomer, right?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.232
Yeah, exactly.

08:24.252 --> 08:25.181
But I enjoyed it,

08:25.201 --> 08:28.866
and I really got a great kick
out of doing the farm work.

08:29.506 --> 08:31.908
Although they didn't
know each other yet,

08:32.256 --> 08:34.611
farm life had a deep
and lasting influence

08:34.631 --> 08:36.493
on both Campbell and Esselstyn.

08:36.513 --> 08:38.996
To make it successful, you
had to have persistence,

08:39.015 --> 08:41.498
staying power, and
tenacity of purpose.

08:41.518 --> 08:43.000
I guess it's ironic in the
sense that we're both

08:43.020 --> 08:46.003
now advocating not
consuming the products

08:46.023 --> 08:49.506
that we were busy actually
producing with our families.

08:49.526 --> 08:52.009
During Campbell and
Esselstyn's lifetimes,

08:52.029 --> 08:56.013
the American diet has
changed dramatically.

08:56.033 --> 08:58.015
Near the beginning
of the 20th century,

08:58.035 --> 09:02.039
Americans each ate about 120
pounds of meat annually.

09:02.539 --> 09:05.522
By 2007, that
figure had exploded

09:05.542 --> 09:08.525
to no less than 222 pounds.

09:08.545 --> 09:11.528
In 1913, we ate about 40 pounds

09:11.548 --> 09:14.031
of processed sugar
each per year.

09:14.051 --> 09:16.033
However by 1999,

09:16.053 --> 09:18.035
our consumption of all
refined sweeteners

09:18.055 --> 09:21.538
had risen to over 147 pounds.

09:21.558 --> 09:24.041
In 1909, Americans consumed

09:24.061 --> 09:28.045
around 294 pounds of
dairy products apiece.

09:28.065 --> 09:31.048
But by 2006, our
yearly intake of dairy

09:31.068 --> 09:35.052
had more than doubled
to 605 pounds.

09:35.072 --> 09:39.556
By the early 1950s, Campbell was
off to college at Penn State

09:39.576 --> 09:42.059
while Esselstyn went to Yale.

09:42.079 --> 09:43.560
As part of Yale's rowing team,

09:43.580 --> 09:47.564
Esselstyn won an olympic
gold medal in 1956.

09:47.584 --> 09:49.566
During this same decade,

09:49.586 --> 09:52.069
the pace of American
life was accelerating,

09:52.089 --> 09:54.571
even with our food.

09:54.591 --> 09:57.574
The late '50s was the heyday
of the drive-in burger joint.

09:57.594 --> 10:00.077
The supermarket was just
beginning to thrive

10:00.097 --> 10:03.080
in the newly built,
post-World War II suburbs.

10:03.100 --> 10:07.084
This was when the so-called
convenience foods were born,

10:07.104 --> 10:10.087
like the legendary
foil-wrapped TV dinner,

10:10.107 --> 10:13.590
not to mention a host of other
tasty processed delicacies

10:13.610 --> 10:17.113
devised to make our lives
easier and better.

10:18.615 --> 10:20.597
By now, Colin Campbell

10:20.617 --> 10:23.600
was in graduate school
at Cornell university,

10:23.620 --> 10:25.121
which had one of the
most prestigious

10:25.622 --> 10:28.105
nutritional science
departments in the country.

10:28.125 --> 10:31.608
His research was on animal
nutrition and biochemistry.

10:31.628 --> 10:35.112
But it was focused more
on feeding animals

10:35.132 --> 10:37.114
for their ability to
be able to produce

10:37.134 --> 10:39.636
meat, milk, and eggs,
protein containing.

10:40.137 --> 10:42.619
And so my own research
was focused on protein,

10:42.639 --> 10:45.622
making sure we got enough.

10:45.642 --> 10:48.144
It was considered to
be the vital nutrient.

10:48.645 --> 10:50.627
It was one of the first
nutrients discovered

10:50.647 --> 10:55.132
and without protein,
the animal would die,

10:55.152 --> 10:57.134
so it was a life force.

10:57.154 --> 11:00.137
In fact, in the
even early 1900s,

11:00.157 --> 11:02.139
there were statements made

11:02.159 --> 11:05.642
that this is the stuff
of civilization itself.

11:05.662 --> 11:08.645
Protein was also
nearly synonymous

11:08.665 --> 11:11.148
with animal-based
foods like meat.

11:11.168 --> 11:14.651
It still is today
all over America.

11:14.671 --> 11:16.653
Why do you think meat is
important in our diet?

11:16.673 --> 11:17.654
Protein.

11:17.674 --> 11:19.656
- Protein.
- Protein.

11:19.676 --> 11:21.158
- Protein.
- Protein.

11:21.178 --> 11:22.659
- Protein.
- Protein.

11:22.679 --> 11:24.661
- Protein.
- A lot of protein in it.

11:24.681 --> 11:26.163
We need protein, don't we?

11:26.183 --> 11:29.166
You can't live without protein.

11:29.186 --> 11:30.667
The idea that plants had protein

11:30.687 --> 11:33.170
also didn't come into play

11:33.190 --> 11:35.672
until maybe the late
1800s, early 1900s,

11:35.692 --> 11:37.674
and then it struggled
through the years.

11:37.694 --> 11:40.177
No matter what source
the protein came from,

11:40.197 --> 11:43.180
in the late 1950s, most
scientists believed

11:43.200 --> 11:45.702
the world needed a
lot more of it.

11:46.203 --> 11:47.184
We had a lot of starving

11:47.204 --> 11:48.685
and malnourished
children in the world.

11:48.705 --> 11:51.688
And so in my community, in
the nutrition community,

11:51.708 --> 11:54.691
there were discussions
about why so.

11:54.711 --> 11:56.193
You know, what could be done?

11:56.213 --> 11:58.195
And one of the
prominent thoughts

11:58.215 --> 12:00.197
was to make sure they
get enough protein.

12:00.217 --> 12:02.199
I certainly went along
with this view.

12:02.219 --> 12:04.701
At about the same time,

12:04.721 --> 12:06.703
Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn
was just beginning

12:06.723 --> 12:08.205
his medical career

12:08.225 --> 12:11.208
at the world famous Cleveland
Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio.

12:11.228 --> 12:14.211
Surgery soon became
his specialty.

12:14.231 --> 12:16.213
There's something awfully
satisfying about

12:16.233 --> 12:18.715
if you can remove the disease.

12:18.735 --> 12:20.217
For instance, if a
patient had gallstones

12:20.237 --> 12:21.218
you could remove them.

12:21.238 --> 12:23.220
If it was a gastric ulcer
or a stomach ulcer,

12:23.240 --> 12:24.741
you directly could
take care of that.

12:25.242 --> 12:27.224
If it's a hernia,
the same thing.

12:27.244 --> 12:28.725
During the 1960s,

12:28.745 --> 12:32.229
heart disease was on
the rise in the U.S.

12:32.249 --> 12:35.232
What doctors commonly call
"coronary artery disease"

12:35.252 --> 12:37.734
is usually caused by a
condition of the arteries

12:37.754 --> 12:39.736
that supply the
heart with blood.

12:39.756 --> 12:42.239
What happens is that over time,

12:42.259 --> 12:45.242
a fatty substance in the
bloodstream called cholesterol

12:45.262 --> 12:47.244
builds up in the
coronary arteries,

12:47.264 --> 12:49.746
restricting the blood
flow to the heart.

12:49.766 --> 12:52.749
This can ultimately
cause several problems,

12:52.769 --> 12:55.252
from severe chest
pain, called angina,

12:55.272 --> 12:56.773
to heart attacks.

12:57.274 --> 12:59.756
Cholesterol is a
natural substance

12:59.776 --> 13:02.759
produced by all animals,
including humans,

13:02.779 --> 13:06.263
and it's an essential component
of our cells' walls.

13:06.283 --> 13:09.266
But when we consume
dietary cholesterol,

13:09.286 --> 13:11.268
which is only found
in animal foods

13:11.288 --> 13:13.770
like meat, eggs, and
dairy products,

13:13.790 --> 13:15.772
it tends to stay in
the bloodstream.

13:15.792 --> 13:18.775
This so-called plaque
is what collects

13:18.795 --> 13:20.277
on the inside of
our blood vessels

13:20.297 --> 13:24.781
and is the major cause of
coronary artery disease.

13:24.801 --> 13:28.805
In the late 1960s, a colleague
of Dr. Esselstyn's

13:29.306 --> 13:31.288
at the Cleveland Clinic
made a major breakthrough

13:31.308 --> 13:33.790
in the treatment
of this condition.

13:33.810 --> 13:35.292
In fact, Esselstyn
shared space with him

13:35.312 --> 13:37.794
in the clinic's
surgical locker room.

13:37.814 --> 13:40.797
His name was Dr. Rene Favaloro.

13:40.817 --> 13:43.800
Rene really sparkled
in the operating room.

13:43.820 --> 13:47.304
And in 1967, he did
this first bypass graft

13:47.324 --> 13:50.807
at the clinic...
coronary artery bypass graft.

13:50.827 --> 13:52.309
This revolutionary new procedure

13:52.329 --> 13:55.812
was accomplished by removing a
vein from the patient's leg,

13:55.832 --> 13:58.815
then stitching it on the heart's
blocked coronary artery

13:58.835 --> 14:03.320
to allow the blood to flow
around, or bypass, the blockage.

14:03.340 --> 14:07.324
Today, over 500,000 Americans
go under the knife annually

14:07.344 --> 14:09.326
for heart bypass surgery.

14:09.346 --> 14:11.328
Costing around $100,000 apiece,

14:11.348 --> 14:15.832
these operations alone
constitute a staggering total

14:15.852 --> 14:17.854
of nearly $50 billion.

14:23.860 --> 14:26.343
Joey Aucoin lives
in Tampa, Florida,

14:26.363 --> 14:29.846
where he owns and operates
a landscaping company.

14:29.866 --> 14:32.349
I tell everybody...
the joke with everybody with me is:

14:32.369 --> 14:34.351
I don't eat to live,
I live to eat.

14:34.371 --> 14:36.853
And I... my whole life, I
ate whatever I wanted.

14:36.873 --> 14:39.375
In 2004, doctors discovered

14:39.876 --> 14:43.360
Joey had a dangerously high
cholesterol level of 320

14:43.380 --> 14:46.863
and a hazardous blood
sugar level of 480.

14:46.883 --> 14:49.866
This not only made him
a type 2 diabetic,

14:49.886 --> 14:53.870
but a prime candidate for a
heart attack and a stroke.

14:53.890 --> 14:56.873
This is my daily pill regiment.

14:56.893 --> 15:00.877
Um, I got two pills I
take for my diabetes.

15:00.897 --> 15:03.880
Then I got one for cholesterol,
one for high blood pressure,

15:03.900 --> 15:07.884
and then I take Byetta, which
is an injectable medicine,

15:07.904 --> 15:11.888
every morning before breakfast
and every night before dinner.

15:11.908 --> 15:14.391
And that's what I've been doing
for almost four years now.

15:14.411 --> 15:16.893
And I know it makes me tired,

15:16.913 --> 15:18.895
and I just...
I just don't feel normal.

15:18.915 --> 15:20.897
I only sleep four
hours a night or so.

15:20.917 --> 15:22.418
I just hate takin' 'em.

15:26.923 --> 15:28.905
In the mid 1960s,

15:28.925 --> 15:30.907
Dr. Campbell was in
the Philippines,

15:30.927 --> 15:32.409
trying to get more protein

15:32.429 --> 15:34.411
to millions of
malnourished children.

15:34.431 --> 15:36.413
To keep costs down,

15:36.433 --> 15:40.417
he and his colleagues decided not
to use animal-based protein.

15:40.437 --> 15:42.919
The program was beginning
to show success.

15:42.939 --> 15:46.423
But then, Dr. Campbell stumbled
onto a piece of information

15:46.443 --> 15:48.925
that was extremely important.

15:48.945 --> 15:51.428
It centered on the more affluent
families in the Philippines,

15:51.448 --> 15:55.932
who were eating relatively high
amounts of animal-based foods.

15:55.952 --> 15:58.435
But at the same time,
they were the ones

15:58.455 --> 15:59.936
most likely to have the children

15:59.956 --> 16:02.458
who were susceptible to
getting liver cancer.

16:02.959 --> 16:04.441
This was very unusual,

16:04.461 --> 16:06.943
since liver cancers are
mainly found in adults.

16:06.963 --> 16:09.946
But just the mere fact that
they occurred in children

16:09.966 --> 16:10.967
said, you know, there's
something here.

16:11.468 --> 16:12.449
This is pretty significant.

16:12.469 --> 16:15.952
Shortly afterward, Dr. Campbell

16:15.972 --> 16:17.454
came across a scientific paper

16:17.474 --> 16:20.457
published in a little-known
Indian medical journal.

16:20.477 --> 16:21.958
It detailed work
that had been done

16:21.978 --> 16:23.960
on a population of
experimental rats

16:23.980 --> 16:28.465
that were first exposed to a
carcinogen called aflatoxin,

16:28.485 --> 16:32.969
then fed a diet of casein, the
main protein found in milk.

16:32.989 --> 16:34.471
They were testing the
effect of protein

16:34.491 --> 16:36.473
on the development
of liver cancer.

16:36.493 --> 16:38.975
They used two different
levels of protein.

16:38.995 --> 16:41.478
They used 20% of total calories,

16:41.498 --> 16:45.482
and then they used a
much lower level, 5%.

16:45.502 --> 16:48.985
20% turned on cancer,
5% turned it off.

16:49.005 --> 16:50.487
This Indian paper,

16:50.507 --> 16:52.489
together with what
Dr. Campbell had learned

16:52.509 --> 16:54.491
about increased liver
cancers in children

16:54.511 --> 16:56.493
eating animal-based foods,

16:56.513 --> 16:59.496
combined to create a
decisive moment in his work

16:59.516 --> 17:01.498
and his life.

17:01.518 --> 17:04.000
Because we learned
that animal protein

17:04.020 --> 17:08.023
was really good in
turning on cancer.

17:09.526 --> 17:11.528
During this same time,

17:12.028 --> 17:14.511
the way Americans ate
was changing, again.

17:14.531 --> 17:17.032
The number of fast-food
franchises was exploding,

17:17.534 --> 17:19.536
as more and more
overscheduled Americans

17:20.036 --> 17:22.018
began using them as
a convenient way

17:22.038 --> 17:24.020
to feed themselves
and their families.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.523
While the fast-food revolution
was sweeping the nation,

17:27.544 --> 17:29.025
the rate of cancer
deaths in America

17:29.045 --> 17:31.027
was continuing to rise.

17:31.047 --> 17:34.030
As a result, in 1971,

17:34.050 --> 17:36.533
president Richard Nixon
initiated a program

17:36.553 --> 17:39.536
that was dubbed "The
War on Cancer."

17:39.556 --> 17:41.037
We are here today
for the purpose

17:41.057 --> 17:44.541
of signing the
Cancer Act of 1971.

17:44.561 --> 17:47.043
And I hope that in
the years ahead

17:47.063 --> 17:50.547
that we may look
back on this day

17:50.567 --> 17:53.550
and this action as being the
most significant action

17:53.570 --> 17:56.553
taken during this
administration.

17:56.573 --> 17:58.054
On the front lines
of this new war

17:58.074 --> 18:00.557
was Caldwell Esselstyn.

18:00.577 --> 18:04.561
By 1978, he was chairman of
the Breast Cancer Task Force

18:04.581 --> 18:05.562
at the Cleveland clinic.

18:05.582 --> 18:07.584
Yet he soon began to doubt

18:08.084 --> 18:11.067
the medical procedures
he was using.

18:11.087 --> 18:12.569
No matter how many
of these operations

18:12.589 --> 18:15.071
I was doing for women
for breast cancer,

18:15.091 --> 18:18.074
I wasn't doing one single thing

18:18.094 --> 18:21.578
for the next
unsuspecting victim.

18:21.598 --> 18:24.080
So Dr. Esselstyn started
investigating

18:24.100 --> 18:26.602
the global statistics
on breast cancer.

18:27.103 --> 18:28.104
One of the facts he discovered

18:28.605 --> 18:30.587
was that the incidence of
breast cancer in Kenya

18:30.607 --> 18:34.090
was far lower than it was
in the United States.

18:34.110 --> 18:38.094
In fact, in 1978, the
chances of a woman

18:38.114 --> 18:39.596
getting breast cancer in Kenya

18:39.616 --> 18:44.601
were 82 times lower
than in the U.S.

18:44.621 --> 18:47.103
Dr. Esselstyn was
even more surprised

18:47.123 --> 18:50.106
by the numbers he discovered for
some other types of cancer.

18:50.126 --> 18:54.130
In the entire nation
of Japan in 1958,

18:54.631 --> 18:56.112
how many autopsy-proven deaths

18:56.132 --> 19:00.617
were there from cancer
of the prostate?

19:00.637 --> 19:02.619
18.

19:02.639 --> 19:04.621
18 in the entire nation.

19:04.641 --> 19:07.123
That, to me, was about
the most mind-boggling

19:07.143 --> 19:11.127
public health figure that I
think I'd ever encountered.

19:11.147 --> 19:13.630
In the same year, the
U.S. population

19:13.650 --> 19:16.132
was only about twice
the size of Japan's,

19:16.152 --> 19:18.635
yet the number of
prostate cancer deaths

19:18.655 --> 19:21.638
exceeded 14,000.

19:21.658 --> 19:23.640
Dr. Esselstyn also
discovered that

19:23.660 --> 19:28.144
in the early 1970s, the risk for
heart disease in rural China

19:28.164 --> 19:31.147
was 12 times lower than
it was in the U.S.

19:31.167 --> 19:33.650
And in the highlands
of Papua New Guinea,

19:33.670 --> 19:36.653
heart disease was
rarely encountered.

19:36.673 --> 19:41.658
The link he noted between all the
areas he studied was simple.

19:41.678 --> 19:43.660
Virtually, the Western
diet was nonexistent.

19:43.680 --> 19:44.661
They had no animal products.

19:44.681 --> 19:46.162
They had no dairy, no meat.

19:46.182 --> 19:47.664
Even more compelling
to Esselstyn

19:47.684 --> 19:50.166
was some historical data that
had long been overlooked.

19:50.186 --> 19:54.671
In World War II, the
Germans occupied Norway.

19:54.691 --> 19:57.674
Among the first things
they did was confiscate

19:57.694 --> 19:59.676
all the livestock
and farm animals

19:59.696 --> 20:02.178
to provide supplies
for their own troops.

20:02.198 --> 20:07.684
So the Norwegians were forced to
eat mainly plant-based foods.

20:07.704 --> 20:10.687
Now we look at the
deaths in Norway,

20:10.707 --> 20:12.188
just antecedent to this period,

20:12.208 --> 20:14.691
from heart attack and stroke.

20:14.711 --> 20:18.695
1927, 1930, '35.

20:18.715 --> 20:20.196
Look at right up here.

20:20.216 --> 20:22.198
Right at the very top, 1939.

20:22.218 --> 20:26.202
Bingo! In come the Germans.

20:26.222 --> 20:28.705
Immediately, 1940, wow.

20:28.725 --> 20:32.208
'41, '42, '43, '44, '45.

20:32.228 --> 20:33.710
Have we ever seen a population

20:33.730 --> 20:36.212
have their cardiovascular
disease plummet

20:36.232 --> 20:38.234
like this from statins,

20:38.735 --> 20:40.717
from bypass surgery,

20:40.737 --> 20:42.719
or from stents?

20:42.739 --> 20:43.720
No.

20:43.740 --> 20:46.222
But look what
immediately happened.

20:46.242 --> 20:49.726
With the cessation of
hostilities in 1945,

20:49.746 --> 20:52.729
back comes the meat,
back comes the dairy,

20:52.749 --> 20:55.732
back comes the strokes
and heart attacks.

20:55.752 --> 20:59.736
I mean, it's such an
absolute, powerful lesson.

20:59.756 --> 21:02.238
But, uh, we didn't get it.

21:02.258 --> 21:04.240
Because of evidence like this,

21:04.260 --> 21:06.743
Dr. Esselstyn was making
the same assessment

21:06.763 --> 21:10.246
that Dr. Campbell was due to
his work in the Philippines,

21:10.266 --> 21:13.750
seeing a causal link
between animal-based foods

21:13.770 --> 21:16.252
and some of our most
deadly diseases.

21:16.272 --> 21:17.754
But they weren't the
only researchers

21:17.774 --> 21:19.756
coming to this conclusion.

21:19.776 --> 21:22.759
Another was Dr. John McDougall.

21:22.779 --> 21:23.760
In the mid 1970s,

21:23.780 --> 21:27.764
he began practicing on a
sugar plantation in Hawaii.

21:27.784 --> 21:32.268
What I observed there was
the health of the people

21:32.288 --> 21:33.770
differed dramatically
depending upon

21:33.790 --> 21:36.773
how long they'd been in Hawaii.

21:36.793 --> 21:40.276
People who were raised in Japan,
the Philippines, Korea, China,

21:40.296 --> 21:43.780
first generation who had moved
from their native land,

21:43.800 --> 21:46.783
were always trim, never
had heart disease,

21:46.803 --> 21:48.785
prostate cancer, colon
cancer, breast cancer,

21:48.805 --> 21:50.787
rheumatoid arthritis,
multiple sclerosis,

21:50.807 --> 21:52.288
never overweight.

21:52.308 --> 21:55.792
They were in their 80s and
90s and fully functional.

21:55.812 --> 21:58.795
Their kids got a little
fatter, a little sicker.

21:58.815 --> 22:00.797
Their grandkids in
the next generation

22:00.817 --> 22:03.800
were just as fat and sick
as anybody I'd ever seen.

22:03.820 --> 22:06.803
And what came through clearly was
the diet was the difference.

22:06.823 --> 22:09.305
The first generation had learned
a diet of rice and vegetables

22:09.325 --> 22:10.807
in their native land.

22:10.827 --> 22:12.809
But the kids, they started
to give up the rice

22:12.829 --> 22:15.311
and replace it with
the animal foods,

22:15.331 --> 22:17.814
the dairy products, the meats,

22:17.834 --> 22:19.315
and the results were obvious.

22:19.335 --> 22:20.817
They got fat and sick.

22:20.837 --> 22:25.321
So I knew at that point
what caused most diseases.

22:25.341 --> 22:27.824
At the time, however,
Campbell and Esselstyn

22:27.844 --> 22:30.326
knew virtually nothing about
this other information.

22:30.346 --> 22:34.831
Even so, they ultimately reached
a revolutionary conclusion...

22:34.851 --> 22:36.853
that many of our most
crippling conditions

22:37.353 --> 22:40.837
could be greatly reduced, if
not completely eradicated,

22:40.857 --> 22:44.841
simply by eating what they call a
whole foods, plant-based diet.

22:44.861 --> 22:47.844
This means consuming
foods that come mainly

22:47.864 --> 22:50.847
from whole, minimally
refined plants

22:50.867 --> 22:54.871
such as fruits, vegetables,
grains, and legumes.

22:55.371 --> 22:57.854
It also means avoiding
animal-based foods

22:57.874 --> 23:00.857
such as meat, dairy, and eggs,

23:00.877 --> 23:03.860
as well as processed foods
like bleached flour,

23:03.880 --> 23:07.363
refined sugars, and oil.

23:07.383 --> 23:09.866
Campbell and Esselstyn's
research in this field

23:09.886 --> 23:11.888
would change their
lives forever.

23:30.406 --> 23:32.388
So, I went through
your preliminary form.

23:32.408 --> 23:33.890
The goals that I have...
tell me if I missing any...

23:33.910 --> 23:36.392
from you were: Eliminate
your shots and medicines.

23:36.412 --> 23:37.413
You want to get off this stuff.

23:37.914 --> 23:38.895
You want to sleep well at night.

23:38.915 --> 23:39.916
You're not doing that.

23:40.416 --> 23:41.898
You want to stop feeling
tired and run down.

23:41.918 --> 23:42.899
You want to lose weight.

23:42.919 --> 23:44.901
- That's it. You got it.
- So those are your goals.

23:44.921 --> 23:46.923
The other complaints: You had low
energy, ringing in the ears,

23:47.423 --> 23:49.906
sinus problems, post nasal
drip, shortness of breath,

23:49.926 --> 23:51.908
wheezing, coughs,
indigestion, and reflux,

23:51.928 --> 23:53.910
loose stool, diarrhea, bloating,

23:53.930 --> 23:56.412
black and bloody mucousy
stool with meat consumption,

23:56.432 --> 23:58.915
and difficulty walking,
getting around,

23:58.935 --> 24:01.918
trouble losing weight, chronic
and unpleasant hunger feelings,

24:01.938 --> 24:03.920
groggy after meals,
strong food cravings,

24:03.940 --> 24:05.922
and anxiety about
food in general.

24:05.942 --> 24:07.944
All of that stuff...
sounds like I'm dead.

24:08.444 --> 24:10.927
So I don't mean to, you know,

24:10.947 --> 24:12.929
harp on the bad stuff,
but, you know,

24:12.949 --> 24:15.932
that will all...
most of that should get better.

24:15.952 --> 24:17.934
My goals, I'm adding in.

24:17.954 --> 24:19.435
Which goals do you have?

24:19.455 --> 24:20.937
I want you to reverse all
your medical diseases,

24:20.957 --> 24:22.438
the ones that we can reverse,

24:22.458 --> 24:23.940
and most of yours, we could.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.942
I told you all the
risk and benefits.

24:25.962 --> 24:28.945
Based on what I told you, I
would stop all these meds.

24:28.965 --> 24:30.967
And I would stop these, on
top of all these risks.

24:31.467 --> 24:32.448
Okay, that's what I'm gonna try.

24:32.468 --> 24:33.950
You're gonna get my best...
my best effort.

24:33.970 --> 24:35.952
I can tell you that.
You'll do good.

24:35.972 --> 24:37.974
You'll do well.

24:39.475 --> 24:43.459
By 1975, Dr. Campbell was
at Cornell University,

24:43.479 --> 24:46.462
investigating what he'd
discovered in the Philippines.

24:46.482 --> 24:48.965
Our work from the
beginning was designed,

24:48.985 --> 24:50.967
in a sense, to do
two main things.

24:50.987 --> 24:54.490
One, I wanted to replicate,
if possible, the Indian work,

24:54.991 --> 24:57.974
because it was so provocative.

24:57.994 --> 25:00.977
Secondly, if this
was really true,

25:00.997 --> 25:02.979
I wanted to study
how does it work?

25:02.999 --> 25:04.500
Just like the
Indian researchers,

25:05.001 --> 25:06.983
Campbell fed half the
rats in his study

25:07.003 --> 25:08.504
a diet of 20% casein,

25:09.005 --> 25:11.988
the main protein
in dairy products.

25:12.008 --> 25:14.490
The other half was
fed only 5% casein.

25:14.510 --> 25:16.492
Over the 12 weeks of the study,

25:16.512 --> 25:18.995
the rats eating the
higher protein diet

25:19.015 --> 25:23.019
had a greatly enhanced level of
early liver cancer tumor growth.

25:23.519 --> 25:27.503
On the other hand, all of the
rats eating only 5% protein

25:27.523 --> 25:31.507
had no evidence of
cancer whatsoever.

25:31.527 --> 25:33.009
But Dr. Campbell decided

25:33.029 --> 25:35.511
to take these findings
a step further.

25:35.531 --> 25:38.014
This time, instead of
keeping his test rats

25:38.034 --> 25:40.516
on the same diet
throughout the study,

25:40.536 --> 25:42.018
he kept them in one group

25:42.038 --> 25:43.539
and switched their
diets back and forth

25:44.040 --> 25:46.522
between 5% and 20%
dairy protein,

25:46.542 --> 25:49.525
doing so at
three-week intervals.

25:49.545 --> 25:51.527
The results were astonishing.

25:51.547 --> 25:54.530
Whenever the rats
were fed 20% protein,

25:54.550 --> 25:57.533
early liver tumor
growth exploded.

25:57.553 --> 26:00.536
But when the same rats
were given 5% protein,

26:00.556 --> 26:04.040
tumor growth actually went down.

26:04.060 --> 26:07.043
I mean, this is so provocative,
this information.

26:07.063 --> 26:11.047
We could turn on and
turn off cancer growth

26:11.067 --> 26:15.051
just by adjusting the level
of intake of that protein.

26:15.071 --> 26:16.552
Going from 5% to 20%

26:16.572 --> 26:18.554
is within the range of
American experience.

26:18.574 --> 26:22.558
The typical studies on chemical
carcinogens causing cancer

26:22.578 --> 26:24.560
are testing chemicals at levels

26:24.580 --> 26:27.563
maybe three or four orders
of magnitude higher

26:27.583 --> 26:29.065
than we experience.

26:29.085 --> 26:31.067
Even more surprisingly,

26:31.087 --> 26:33.569
Dr. Campbell discovered
that a 20% diet

26:33.589 --> 26:35.591
of plant proteins from
soy beans and wheat

26:36.092 --> 26:38.574
did not promote cancer.

26:38.594 --> 26:41.096
However, there's a longstanding
belief among the public

26:41.597 --> 26:45.581
that animal protein is
important for human health.

26:45.601 --> 26:49.585
Connie diekman supports
this position.

26:49.605 --> 26:51.587
Ms. Diekman is
director of nutrition

26:51.607 --> 26:54.610
at Washington University in St.
Louis, Missouri.

26:55.111 --> 26:58.594
She's the past President of the
American Dietetic Association,

26:58.614 --> 27:01.597
and an advisor to the
National Dairy Council.

27:01.617 --> 27:05.601
When you eliminate animal
foods from your eating plan,

27:05.621 --> 27:09.605
you run the risk of
inadequate protein content.

27:09.625 --> 27:13.128
Animal proteins provide
all the amino acids

27:13.629 --> 27:16.112
that we need for cell growth,

27:16.132 --> 27:19.115
tissue repair, and
overall health.

27:19.135 --> 27:21.617
Eating whole foods, it's
virtually impossible

27:21.637 --> 27:24.620
to be protein deficient without
being calorie deficient.

27:24.640 --> 27:27.123
Because even if you
take the foods

27:27.143 --> 27:28.624
that have the least
amount of protein in it,

27:28.644 --> 27:31.127
let's say potatoes,
for example, or rice.

27:31.147 --> 27:32.628
You know, 8%, 9%.

27:32.648 --> 27:34.630
Well, that's the figure
we more or less need.

27:34.650 --> 27:37.152
Dr. Campbell's research
led him to a conclusion

27:37.653 --> 27:39.135
about the way genes, chemicals,

27:39.155 --> 27:42.638
and nutrition interact
to promote cancer.

27:42.658 --> 27:44.140
Cancer starts with genes.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.142
It might be genes
we're born with,

27:46.162 --> 27:49.645
it might be genes that are
actually changed by a chemical,

27:49.665 --> 27:54.650
so those genes become capable
of producing cancer cells.

27:54.670 --> 27:57.153
Whether we do or
don't get cancer

27:57.173 --> 27:59.155
is primarily related
to how we promote

27:59.175 --> 28:03.159
those cancer cells
to grow over time.

28:03.179 --> 28:05.661
That's where nutrition
comes into play.

28:05.681 --> 28:10.666
They grow much more rapidly when
they were fed animal protein.

28:10.686 --> 28:12.688
Dr. Campbell and other
nutritional scientists

28:13.189 --> 28:15.671
have found that only a small
percentage of cancer cases

28:15.691 --> 28:19.175
are caused solely by genes.

28:19.195 --> 28:21.177
I think the general
consensus in my field

28:21.197 --> 28:24.680
is that probably not more
than 1% or 2% at most

28:24.700 --> 28:28.184
is attributed to the genes
we may or may not have.

28:28.204 --> 28:29.685
And that's the most helpful

28:29.705 --> 28:31.687
and hopeful information
I give people.

28:31.707 --> 28:32.688
Because if you go through life

28:32.708 --> 28:34.190
thinking that what
happens to you

28:34.210 --> 28:35.691
from a health perspective
is based on your genes,

28:35.711 --> 28:36.712
you're a helpless victim.

28:37.213 --> 28:39.195
My diet was pretty abominable.

28:39.215 --> 28:41.197
I thought the two
principal food groups

28:41.217 --> 28:42.698
were caffeine and sugar.

28:42.718 --> 28:44.700
Dr. Pam Popper is
executive director

28:44.720 --> 28:47.203
of the Wellness Forum
in Columbus, Ohio,

28:47.223 --> 28:50.706
and an expert in the areas
of health and nutrition.

28:50.726 --> 28:54.210
The women in my family are
all overweight. I'm not.

28:54.230 --> 28:56.712
I don't eat and live
like they do, you know.

28:56.732 --> 28:58.714
So, I've changed
my health destiny

28:58.734 --> 29:01.217
by not engaging in
the same habits.

29:01.237 --> 29:03.719
Over the next several years,

29:03.739 --> 29:05.721
Dr. Campbell initiated
more extensive lab studies

29:05.741 --> 29:08.724
using various animal
and plant nutrients.

29:08.744 --> 29:11.227
The results were consistent:

29:11.247 --> 29:14.730
Nutrients from animal foods
promoted cancer growth,

29:14.750 --> 29:19.235
while nutrients from plant
foods decreased cancer growth.

29:19.255 --> 29:22.238
Yet Campbell hadn't identified a
specific biological mechanism

29:22.258 --> 29:24.740
that caused the
effects he observed.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.242
And it finally occurred to me

29:26.262 --> 29:29.745
that there is no such
thing as the mechanism.

29:29.765 --> 29:33.268
What we are looking at was
a symphony of mechanisms.

29:33.769 --> 29:35.751
We think that nutrition
is attributed

29:35.771 --> 29:37.253
to individual nutrients.

29:37.273 --> 29:38.754
And that's the way
it gets marketed

29:38.774 --> 29:40.756
and that's the way the
companies tell us, so forth.

29:40.776 --> 29:42.758
When, in fact, nutrition,

29:42.778 --> 29:45.261
all of it working together
to create this symphony,

29:45.281 --> 29:46.762
the hundreds of thousands

29:46.782 --> 29:48.764
of different kinds of
chemicals in food,

29:48.784 --> 29:50.266
all kind of working
together nicely.

29:50.286 --> 29:52.768
I mean, the complexity is total.

29:52.788 --> 29:54.270
That's a holistic concept.

29:54.290 --> 29:58.774
And I had to say to myself,
that's a very exciting idea.

29:58.794 --> 30:00.276
Dr. Campbell realized

30:00.296 --> 30:01.777
that his discoveries
in the laboratory

30:01.797 --> 30:03.779
were significant, but limited.

30:03.799 --> 30:06.782
How were these findings
relevant in people?

30:06.802 --> 30:08.784
How do different types of foods

30:08.804 --> 30:11.287
affect cancer and
other diseases?

30:11.307 --> 30:15.311
Campbell needed a large-scale
population study.

30:17.313 --> 30:19.815
He would soon find a
perfect opportunity.

30:30.826 --> 30:33.309
So mangoes are really good.

30:33.329 --> 30:34.810
They flavor things
really nicely.

30:34.830 --> 30:36.312
- Okay.
- That's something...

30:36.332 --> 30:37.813
you wanna get a riper one.

30:37.833 --> 30:41.817
Dr. Matt Lederman and his wife,
Dr. Alona Pulde,

30:41.837 --> 30:44.320
are among a small but growing
number of physicians

30:44.340 --> 30:47.323
who use a whole foods,
plant-based diet

30:47.343 --> 30:49.825
as a primary treatment
for their patients.

30:49.845 --> 30:51.827
From shopping with
patients to teach them

30:51.847 --> 30:53.329
how to read nutrition labels...

30:53.349 --> 30:54.330
And I don't care what it says

30:54.350 --> 30:56.332
on the front, the
back, or the sides...

30:56.352 --> 30:57.353
both: Look at the ingredients.

30:57.853 --> 30:58.834
And that's all I care about.

30:58.854 --> 31:01.337
To showing patients
how to prepare meals,

31:01.357 --> 31:04.340
they are not your typical m.D.S.

31:04.360 --> 31:07.343
Doctors Lederman and Pulde
use food as treatment

31:07.363 --> 31:10.346
because they feel it's the
best medicine available...

31:10.366 --> 31:12.848
medicine that not only makes
their patients feel better

31:12.868 --> 31:15.871
but that truly
improves their health.

31:18.374 --> 31:21.357
In 1973, the U.S. congress

31:21.377 --> 31:23.859
passed a new farm subsidy bill.

31:23.879 --> 31:26.862
Among other things, it
included incentives

31:26.882 --> 31:30.366
that encouraged a massive
increase in corn production.

31:30.386 --> 31:33.369
One of the major byproducts
of this enormous corn surplus

31:33.389 --> 31:37.873
was a low-cost sweetener called
"high fructose corn syrup".

31:37.893 --> 31:39.875
Companies could add this
sweetener to anything

31:39.895 --> 31:41.377
from soda pop to hot dogs,

31:41.397 --> 31:45.881
and then make these products
widely available at low prices.

31:45.901 --> 31:48.384
Processed sugars and
other refined foods

31:48.404 --> 31:49.885
are far more calorie-dense

31:49.905 --> 31:51.887
than the whole plants
they're made from.

31:51.907 --> 31:53.889
The dramatic increase
in their use

31:53.909 --> 31:57.393
is a major reason why our
food has become richer.

31:57.413 --> 32:00.896
To evolutionary psychologist
and author Dr. Doug Lisle,

32:00.916 --> 32:02.398
the consumption of
unnaturally dense foods

32:02.418 --> 32:06.402
is the main cause for the
epidemic of obesity in America.

32:06.422 --> 32:08.904
It isn't that people have
become more self-indulgent.

32:08.924 --> 32:12.408
It isn't because they're
lazier than they ever were.

32:12.428 --> 32:14.910
What's happening is that their
mechanisms of satiation

32:14.930 --> 32:16.412
are being fooled.

32:16.432 --> 32:17.913
The process starts

32:17.933 --> 32:18.914
with a range of receptors
in our stomachs

32:18.934 --> 32:21.917
that help us gauge how
much food we've eaten.

32:21.937 --> 32:24.420
These include stretch
receptors to help measure

32:24.440 --> 32:26.922
the sheer volume of
food in our stomachs.

32:26.942 --> 32:29.425
We also have density receptors,

32:29.445 --> 32:31.427
to help determine the
caloric density,

32:31.447 --> 32:35.431
or what we more commonly call
the richness of our food.

32:35.451 --> 32:38.934
For instance, 500 calories
of natural plant food

32:38.954 --> 32:40.455
fills the stomach completely,

32:40.956 --> 32:43.939
triggering both our stretch
and density receptors

32:43.959 --> 32:46.942
to signal our brain that
we've had enough to eat.

32:46.962 --> 32:50.446
But 500 calories of unnaturally
rich or processed food

32:50.466 --> 32:52.948
fills the stomach far less,

32:52.968 --> 32:54.950
deceiving these receptors
into telling our brain

32:54.970 --> 32:56.471
that we need to eat more.

32:56.972 --> 32:59.474
Even worse is 500
calories of oil,

32:59.975 --> 33:01.457
which is almost pure fat

33:01.477 --> 33:04.460
and barely triggers
any response at all.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.462
The problem with weight
management in humans

33:06.482 --> 33:08.964
is that if you make these
foods completely artificial,

33:08.984 --> 33:10.466
which we do today,

33:10.486 --> 33:13.469
you wind up with a problem
that people have to overeat

33:13.489 --> 33:14.970
just to be satisfied.

33:14.990 --> 33:16.972
But why do these
concentrated foods

33:16.992 --> 33:20.476
that are so harmful to us
give us so much pleasure?

33:20.496 --> 33:22.478
Dr. Lisle says the
answer is related

33:22.498 --> 33:25.981
to a system called the
motivational triad.

33:26.001 --> 33:28.003
This is a trio of
biological mechanisms

33:28.504 --> 33:30.986
that nature has designed
into every creature on earth

33:31.006 --> 33:32.488
so they can survive
to pass their genes

33:32.508 --> 33:34.990
on to the next generation.

33:35.010 --> 33:37.012
The first leg of the
motivational triad

33:37.513 --> 33:39.495
is pleasure seeking.

33:39.515 --> 33:42.498
And, primarily, two things
are the cause of that,

33:42.518 --> 33:45.000
and those two things
are food and sex.

33:45.020 --> 33:46.502
So in the case of a
great white shark,

33:46.522 --> 33:50.005
its basically got a neon sign
flashing across its forehead

33:50.025 --> 33:53.008
saying, "food, sex,
food, sex, food, sex."

33:53.028 --> 33:55.511
Unless it's a male, then it
says, "sex, food, sex, food,"

33:55.531 --> 33:57.513
but it's pretty much
the same thing.

33:57.533 --> 34:00.015
The other two legs of
the motivational triad

34:00.035 --> 34:01.517
are avoiding pain

34:01.537 --> 34:04.520
and doing everything with
the least amount of effort.

34:04.540 --> 34:06.522
Pleasure seeking,
pain avoidance,

34:06.542 --> 34:07.523
and energy conservation,

34:07.543 --> 34:09.525
that really sums up
animal behavior,

34:09.545 --> 34:12.027
whether we're talking about a
paramecium under a microscope

34:12.047 --> 34:13.529
or a great white shark.

34:13.549 --> 34:16.532
Richer foods naturally
excite our senses

34:16.552 --> 34:18.033
because it's nature's
way of telling us

34:18.053 --> 34:20.554
they will provide the highest
amount of dietary reward

34:21.056 --> 34:24.039
with the least amount of effort.

34:24.059 --> 34:26.542
This helped our ancestors
find the most calorie-dense

34:26.562 --> 34:27.543
and ripe foods available,

34:27.563 --> 34:32.047
which contributed
to our survival.

34:32.067 --> 34:33.047
But in today's environment,

34:33.068 --> 34:35.551
we can artificially
increase calorie density

34:35.571 --> 34:39.054
well beyond what our ancestors
would have found in nature.

34:39.074 --> 34:42.077
The resulting foods give us a
hyper-normal amount of pleasure,

34:42.578 --> 34:44.059
leading us into something

34:44.079 --> 34:47.062
Dr. Lisle calls the
pleasure trap.

34:47.081 --> 34:50.065
What the pleasure trap
is is an interaction

34:50.085 --> 34:52.568
between our natural instincts,

34:52.588 --> 34:54.570
which are trying to tell
us the right thing to do,

34:54.590 --> 34:57.092
and some kind of artificial,
modern stimulation

34:57.593 --> 35:00.596
that is piggybacking or
hijacking that process.

35:01.096 --> 35:02.597
So the classic example
of the pleasure trap

35:03.098 --> 35:05.581
would be drugs and
drug addiction.

35:05.601 --> 35:09.084
The way drugs work
is they hijack

35:09.104 --> 35:11.106
the existing pleasure circuits.

35:11.607 --> 35:14.089
When certain chemicals
hit those areas,

35:14.109 --> 35:16.611
they cause feelings of
euphoria and excitement.

35:17.112 --> 35:19.094
The same drug-like
effect happens

35:19.114 --> 35:22.617
when we eat highly
concentrated, processed foods.

35:23.118 --> 35:25.100
We've removed the fiber,
we've removed the water,

35:25.120 --> 35:26.621
we've removed the minerals.

35:27.122 --> 35:28.103
We've done everything
that we can

35:28.123 --> 35:31.106
to hyper-concentrate
sugar and fat

35:31.126 --> 35:33.108
and add a bunch of salt
as well into the food,

35:33.128 --> 35:34.610
and now what the food has become

35:34.630 --> 35:36.612
is it's become a
low-grade addiction.

35:36.632 --> 35:38.614
These things are drugs.

35:38.634 --> 35:40.616
They have other
deleterious side effects,

35:40.636 --> 35:43.619
not the least of which is
adding a lot of empty calories.

35:43.639 --> 35:46.121
Dr. Terry Mason is
commissioner of health

35:46.141 --> 35:48.624
for the city of Chicago.

35:48.644 --> 35:50.145
He's one of the few public
officials in America

35:50.646 --> 35:53.629
who openly supports
a plant-based diet.

35:53.649 --> 35:57.132
If it walked, hopped,
swam, crawled, slithered,

35:57.152 --> 36:00.636
had eyes, a mom and a dad...
don't eat it.

36:00.656 --> 36:02.157
Dr. Mason contends

36:02.658 --> 36:04.660
that the less affluent
segments of our population

36:05.160 --> 36:07.643
have difficulty making
the best food choices.

36:07.663 --> 36:09.645
Well, first of all,

36:09.665 --> 36:13.649
the diets are calorie-rich
and nutrient-poor.

36:13.669 --> 36:15.651
This is the real problem.

36:15.671 --> 36:19.655
And, unfortunately, poor
people are poor in everything.

36:19.675 --> 36:22.658
They're poor in health,
they're poor in food choices,

36:22.678 --> 36:26.662
they're poor in almost every
aspect that you could think of.

36:26.682 --> 36:28.163
This makes the less prosperous

36:28.183 --> 36:30.666
particularly vulnerable to
the low-grade addiction

36:30.686 --> 36:33.168
of highly processed foods.

36:33.188 --> 36:34.670
People want stuff that's fast,

36:34.690 --> 36:36.672
people want stuff that's quick,

36:36.692 --> 36:39.174
and they like the
stuff that's salty,

36:39.194 --> 36:41.677
and they like the taste
of something fried.

36:41.697 --> 36:43.679
And so those are the
kinds of things

36:43.699 --> 36:46.201
that you see in our community.

36:58.213 --> 37:01.196
San'dera Nation lives
in a quiet suburb

37:01.216 --> 37:03.699
in Cleveland, Ohio,
with her five children.

37:03.719 --> 37:08.704
In October 2008, she was
stricken by a strange illness.

37:08.724 --> 37:11.707
I wanna say something,
but it's not coming out.

37:11.727 --> 37:14.209
I'm getting really
shaky and sweats,

37:14.229 --> 37:15.711
and then I'm cold and I'm sick

37:15.731 --> 37:17.713
and I'm fatigued, and my
stomach hurts and everything.

37:17.733 --> 37:19.214
So I went to the doctor,

37:19.234 --> 37:24.219
and that's when he diagnosed me
with hypertension and diabetes.

37:24.239 --> 37:25.740
Like Joey Aucoin,

37:26.241 --> 37:29.725
San'dera was treated with
expensive prescription drugs.

37:29.745 --> 37:32.227
I was in denial for a while.

37:32.247 --> 37:35.731
I heard what they said, but
I was in denial, like, mmm.

37:35.751 --> 37:38.253
I still ate things
I shouldn't have.

37:38.754 --> 37:39.735
I didn't really
get the education

37:39.755 --> 37:41.737
that I needed to know,

37:41.757 --> 37:45.240
so I really depended on
that pill to save me.

37:45.260 --> 37:47.743
Then San'dera met with
Dr. Esselstyn,

37:47.763 --> 37:50.245
who recommended that she
treat her illnesses

37:50.265 --> 37:52.748
with a whole foods,
plant-based diet.

37:52.768 --> 37:54.750
Come on in, and
we'll get to work.

37:54.770 --> 38:00.255
I was a little nervous, but
he made it real easy for me.

38:00.275 --> 38:02.758
I was real interested
in what he had to say

38:02.778 --> 38:03.779
and what he was
going to teach me

38:04.279 --> 38:07.282
and the new journey that I
would be taking with him.

38:28.804 --> 38:30.786
Between China and the
United States...

38:30.806 --> 38:33.288
In 1974, Chinese
premier zhou enlai

38:33.308 --> 38:37.292
was hospitalized
with bladder cancer.

38:37.312 --> 38:39.795
Knowing that his
disease was terminal,

38:39.815 --> 38:40.796
he decided to give his country

38:40.816 --> 38:43.799
a more complete
understanding of cancer.

38:43.819 --> 38:45.300
So he initiated
what would become

38:45.320 --> 38:47.302
one of the largest
and most thorough

38:47.322 --> 38:50.305
scientific studies in history.

38:50.325 --> 38:54.309
650,000 researchers catalogued
the mortality patterns

38:54.329 --> 38:55.811
caused by several
types of cancer

38:55.831 --> 39:01.316
for the years between
1973 and 1975.

39:01.336 --> 39:03.819
The study encompassed
every county in China

39:03.839 --> 39:07.342
and over 880 million people.

39:07.843 --> 39:12.327
Zhou died in 1976, years
before his study was complete.

39:12.347 --> 39:15.330
Okay, and you'll need
how many shirts?

39:15.350 --> 39:17.833
Probably three?

39:17.853 --> 39:19.835
- Yeah.
- Okay.

39:19.855 --> 39:20.836
Zhou enlai's cancer study

39:20.856 --> 39:22.838
would ultimately
have a major impact

39:22.858 --> 39:25.340
on what Dr. Campbell himself
has called

39:25.360 --> 39:27.862
the capstone of his research.

39:31.867 --> 39:33.348
Early 1980.

39:33.368 --> 39:34.850
And you were there for
two or three months?

39:34.870 --> 39:37.853
Dr. Junshi Chen is now
senior research Professor

39:37.873 --> 39:41.356
with the Chinese center for
disease control and prevention.

39:41.376 --> 39:43.859
He first met Dr. Campbell
at Cornell in 1980,

39:43.879 --> 39:45.861
when he was a member of
the Chinese Institute

39:45.881 --> 39:48.884
of Food and Nutrition Science.

39:49.384 --> 39:51.366
The cold war was just
beginning to thaw,

39:51.386 --> 39:54.369
and Dr. Chen was among the
first senior scientists

39:54.389 --> 39:56.872
from China to visit
the United States.

39:56.892 --> 39:58.874
By then, Dr. Campbell had become

39:58.894 --> 39:59.875
one of the most distinguished

39:59.895 --> 40:02.377
nutritional biochemists
in the world.

40:02.397 --> 40:04.880
When they discovered this book,

40:04.900 --> 40:08.383
a significant
collaboration was born.

40:08.403 --> 40:13.388
This is the atlas of
cancer mortality in China.

40:13.408 --> 40:16.892
Published in 1981,
the cancer atlas

40:16.912 --> 40:20.395
was the result of Zhou
Enlai's nationwide study.

40:20.415 --> 40:23.918
It showed a highly unusual
geographical distribution

40:24.419 --> 40:26.401
of different types
of cancer in China,

40:26.421 --> 40:30.906
which tended to be clustered
in certain hot spots.

40:30.926 --> 40:33.929
The same was true with
cancer after cancer.

40:34.429 --> 40:35.911
And the counties with
the highest levels

40:35.931 --> 40:36.932
were often far greater

40:37.432 --> 40:39.414
than the counties with
the lowest levels.

40:39.434 --> 40:42.918
So, for example,
esophageal cancer,

40:42.938 --> 40:44.920
according to this cancer map,

40:44.940 --> 40:48.924
the mortality has a
400-fold difference

40:48.944 --> 40:52.928
among different
counties in China.

40:52.948 --> 40:53.929
- That's huge.
- Yeah.

40:53.949 --> 40:57.432
And in...
I understood, in the United States,

40:57.452 --> 41:00.936
only several-fold difference.
Not even...

41:00.956 --> 41:03.438
maybe twofold or so, we see.

41:03.458 --> 41:06.942
Yeah, yeah.
So that caught our attention

41:06.962 --> 41:09.945
in term of, so, why?

41:09.965 --> 41:12.447
Because they're all Chinese.

41:12.467 --> 41:13.949
Genetically, they
are all the same.

41:13.969 --> 41:17.953
And the why they have
so much difference

41:17.973 --> 41:20.956
in single cancer mortality?

41:20.976 --> 41:24.960
So we believe it has to be
related to the environment.

41:24.980 --> 41:27.462
The bigger environment.

41:27.482 --> 41:29.984
And from our professional
perspective,

41:30.485 --> 41:32.987
of course, it's
diet and nutrition.

41:33.488 --> 41:34.970
Dr. Chen and I said, you know,

41:34.990 --> 41:37.472
"why don't we just go
there and do a study?"

41:37.492 --> 41:39.474
For Dr. Campbell,

41:39.494 --> 41:41.977
it was the opportunity
he'd been looking for.

41:41.997 --> 41:44.980
Among other things, he could
examine how his observations

41:45.000 --> 41:47.482
about liver cancer
in Filipino children

41:47.502 --> 41:49.985
and the findings
from his lab studies

41:50.005 --> 41:53.008
applied to a large
human population.

41:53.508 --> 41:54.990
The project would consider

41:55.010 --> 41:58.493
367 diet and
health-related variables,

41:58.513 --> 42:00.495
making it one of
the most ambitious

42:00.515 --> 42:03.999
nutritional studies
ever conceived.

42:04.019 --> 42:05.000
Dr. Campbell and his associates

42:05.020 --> 42:09.004
carefully chose 65 counties
scattered across China.

42:09.024 --> 42:11.506
These counties were
mainly located in rural

42:11.526 --> 42:13.508
or semi-rural areas.

42:13.528 --> 42:16.011
We used the rural counties

42:16.031 --> 42:19.514
because they are stable
in their residents,

42:19.534 --> 42:22.017
and they have been
in this lifestyle

42:22.037 --> 42:25.520
for at least 20 to 30 years.

42:25.540 --> 42:27.522
More than 350 workers
were trained.

42:27.542 --> 42:31.026
They carefully surveyed
the diet and lifestyle

42:31.046 --> 42:35.530
of 6,500 people in
the chosen counties.

42:35.550 --> 42:39.534
Urine and blood samples
were also taken.

42:39.554 --> 42:44.039
In 1983, doctors Campbell,
chen, and their collaborators

42:44.059 --> 42:47.042
began to analyze the vast
amount of information

42:47.062 --> 42:48.543
that had been collected.

42:48.563 --> 42:51.065
The job would take years.

42:55.570 --> 42:58.053
After eight weeks eating
plant-based foods,

42:58.073 --> 43:01.556
Joey Aucoin was still off
all his medications.

43:01.576 --> 43:04.059
When I started this, I had
all these side effects

43:04.079 --> 43:07.562
from medication and from
my being so unhealthy.

43:07.582 --> 43:10.565
But now I'm getting in better
and better shape every day.

43:10.585 --> 43:11.566
I feel more healthy.

43:11.586 --> 43:13.568
I very seldom get
tired during the day.

43:13.588 --> 43:16.071
I just feel so
good all the time.

43:16.091 --> 43:18.573
This... this is the scale
that I weigh myself on.

43:18.593 --> 43:23.578
And it started about eight weeks
ago way up here around 218, 220.

43:23.598 --> 43:27.602
And now it's bouncing
between 180 and 185.

43:28.103 --> 43:29.084
None of my belts fit.

43:29.104 --> 43:31.086
This one here, I
actually had to have

43:31.106 --> 43:34.589
two new holes punched in, 'cause
I liked the belt so much.

43:34.609 --> 43:36.091
Nothing fits.
I gotta go shopping.

43:36.111 --> 43:38.593
It's just everything,
all my clothes.

43:38.613 --> 43:40.595
A good problem to have.

43:40.615 --> 43:41.596
It's been fun for him,

43:41.616 --> 43:43.098
because I think he's learned

43:43.118 --> 43:45.600
in addition to the fact that
he's seeing such great results,

43:45.620 --> 43:48.603
that it's...He loves it.

43:48.623 --> 43:50.105
I don't think he'll go
back to his old ways.

43:50.125 --> 43:53.108
He feels too good, and he likes...

43:53.128 --> 43:55.110
even if he started to
go off a little bit,

43:55.130 --> 43:58.113
he feels too good, his energy's
too good, he looks younger.

43:58.133 --> 43:59.614
And the fact that he
would have to go back

43:59.634 --> 44:02.117
on all the meds, you
know, if he did,

44:02.137 --> 44:04.119
I think that that's
a huge motivation

44:04.139 --> 44:07.142
for him to maintain
the lifestyle.

44:11.646 --> 44:15.630
In the mid-1980s, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn

44:15.650 --> 44:17.132
was struggling to
organize a study

44:17.152 --> 44:19.634
on coronary artery disease.

44:19.654 --> 44:21.636
His plan was to put
a group of patients

44:21.656 --> 44:23.638
on a diet of low-fat
plant-based foods,

44:23.658 --> 44:27.142
along with small quantities
of low-fat dairy products

44:27.162 --> 44:31.646
and minimal amounts of
cholesterol reducing drugs.

44:31.666 --> 44:34.649
And slowly over the
next, uh, 18 months,

44:34.669 --> 44:37.152
I got the 24 patients
that I had asked for.

44:37.172 --> 44:38.653
But the ones they sent me

44:38.673 --> 44:41.656
Were a little bit sicker
than I had thought.

44:41.676 --> 44:42.677
These were patients
who had failed

44:43.178 --> 44:45.160
their first or second
bypass operation.

44:45.180 --> 44:47.662
They had failed their first
or second angioplasty.

44:47.682 --> 44:49.164
And there were
five who were told

44:49.184 --> 44:50.665
by their expert cardiologists

44:50.685 --> 44:52.167
they would not
live out the year.

44:52.187 --> 44:54.689
One of the most
gravely ill patients

44:55.190 --> 44:57.672
was a 59-year-old speech and
communications teacher,

44:57.692 --> 44:59.674
Evelyn oswick.

44:59.694 --> 45:02.177
Ate all the chocolate
candy I could eat,

45:02.197 --> 45:04.679
ate every doughnut I
could put my hands on.

45:04.699 --> 45:06.681
Oh, I just love
things like that,

45:06.701 --> 45:08.183
a lot of gravy.

45:08.203 --> 45:10.685
And then, um, I had my...

45:10.705 --> 45:13.688
I have had two heart attacks
before I met Dr. Esselstyn.

45:13.708 --> 45:16.691
When I had the
second heart attack,

45:16.711 --> 45:20.195
the doctor said that I
should prepare for death,

45:20.215 --> 45:21.696
really is what he said.

45:21.716 --> 45:23.198
And I looked at him and I said,

45:23.218 --> 45:26.201
"do you really mean that
what you want me to do

45:26.221 --> 45:27.222
"is buy a rocking chair

45:27.722 --> 45:29.204
and just sit there and
rock away and wait?"

45:29.224 --> 45:31.206
And he just looked
at me and he said,

45:31.226 --> 45:33.728
"yes, that's just exactly
what I'm saying."

45:37.732 --> 45:42.217
Anthony Yen was born
and raised in China.

45:42.237 --> 45:46.221
And we were eating a typical
Chinese cultural diet.

45:46.241 --> 45:49.724
A very small piece of meat.

45:49.744 --> 45:54.729
But they sliced it, and so
it was cooked for flavor

45:54.749 --> 45:56.231
rather than your American style,

45:56.251 --> 45:59.734
when you eat, you eat a large,
great, big piece of meat,

45:59.754 --> 46:03.738
which you could easily fed
the whole family in China.

46:03.758 --> 46:06.260
And we eat a lot of
vegetables in China.

46:06.761 --> 46:07.742
And we had soup.

46:07.762 --> 46:09.263
But once I came to
the United States,

46:09.764 --> 46:13.748
you find beginning to
experience fast food.

46:13.768 --> 46:17.752
The hamburgers and
cheeseburgers, pizza.

46:17.772 --> 46:19.754
And I noticed my weight
beginning to gain.

46:19.774 --> 46:22.757
When Mr. Yen was 56 years old,

46:22.777 --> 46:26.261
he suddenly experienced
severe chest pains.

46:26.281 --> 46:30.265
At that point in time, I
had a open heart surgery.

46:30.285 --> 46:34.269
I have five bypass... five.

46:34.289 --> 46:36.771
But it was very interesting.

46:36.791 --> 46:40.275
About a week later, uh,

46:40.295 --> 46:43.778
I felt my chest
tighten up again.

46:43.798 --> 46:49.284
So myself and my wife went
to see Dr. Esselstyn.

46:49.304 --> 46:52.787
I saw every one of
these patients myself

46:52.807 --> 46:55.290
every two weeks for
the first five years.

46:55.310 --> 46:57.792
And at that visit, we would get

46:57.812 --> 47:00.295
a full cholesterol
lipid profile.

47:00.315 --> 47:03.298
We would get blood
pressure, weight,

47:03.318 --> 47:05.300
and I would go over
every morsel they ate.

47:05.320 --> 47:07.302
By using simple foods

47:07.322 --> 47:09.804
as the main treatment
for his patients,

47:09.824 --> 47:13.828
Dr. Esselstyn was bucking a
high-tech, high-cost system

47:14.329 --> 47:15.810
that was deeply entrenched
in both big medicine

47:15.830 --> 47:17.812
and big government.

47:17.832 --> 47:19.814
You know, behind my back,

47:19.834 --> 47:22.317
I got to be known as Dr. Sprouts.

47:22.337 --> 47:26.341
But I guess I've always
liked a challenge.

47:28.843 --> 47:31.826
We preheated the oven,
got the water going.

47:31.846 --> 47:33.347
I just added some seasonings.

47:33.848 --> 47:35.830
And then we add the
onions and the spinach.

47:35.850 --> 47:38.333
I've never been a morning
person, my whole life.

47:38.353 --> 47:42.837
And, uh, but previous
to this experience,

47:42.857 --> 47:47.342
um, it had probably
been worse than ever.

47:47.362 --> 47:51.846
And that entailed needing
to get up in the morning

47:51.866 --> 47:54.349
and caffeinate myself

47:54.369 --> 47:56.851
with cokes and red bulls
and stuff like that,

47:56.871 --> 48:00.355
uh, before I could even
think or start to work.

48:00.375 --> 48:02.357
We didn't make the rice noodles,

48:02.377 --> 48:04.859
but you can just
boil them real quick

48:04.879 --> 48:06.361
and then throw this
on top of them.

48:06.381 --> 48:07.862
Right, right.

48:07.882 --> 48:09.864
He's actually eating more often,

48:09.884 --> 48:12.867
but he's eating the right
foods, and he lost weight.

48:12.887 --> 48:15.870
So he certainly feels
much better that way.

48:15.890 --> 48:18.392
And you can tell it in
his face, in his neck,

48:18.893 --> 48:19.874
you know, in his belly.

48:19.894 --> 48:21.876
It's all...
he's lost a lot of weight there.

48:21.896 --> 48:23.378
He also has a better energy.

48:23.398 --> 48:24.879
Um, he's waking up earlier now.

48:24.899 --> 48:27.882
That's great, because we have
then some morning time together.

48:27.902 --> 48:30.385
I don't have to carry anything.

48:30.405 --> 48:31.886
You're the doctor.

48:36.411 --> 48:37.892
1990.

48:37.912 --> 48:40.895
Following nearly a decade
of intense effort,

48:40.915 --> 48:42.897
Dr. Campbell and his colleagues

48:42.917 --> 48:44.899
finally publish
their China study.

48:44.919 --> 48:48.903
It identified no less
than 94,000 correlations

48:48.923 --> 48:50.905
between diet and disease.

48:50.925 --> 48:53.408
Those are big numbers
for any study.

48:53.428 --> 48:54.909
And in the end of the day,

48:54.929 --> 48:57.412
when we did all these
correlations in this book here,

48:57.432 --> 48:58.913
and we looked at
the number of them

48:58.933 --> 49:00.915
that were statistically
significant,

49:00.935 --> 49:03.918
it was between about
8,000 to 9,000.

49:03.938 --> 49:05.420
When you have that large
number of correlations

49:05.440 --> 49:08.423
then you start
analyzing each one,

49:08.443 --> 49:10.425
if it works out as
statistically significant,

49:10.445 --> 49:12.427
this means that if 19 out of 20

49:12.447 --> 49:14.429
are pointing in the
same direction,

49:14.449 --> 49:16.431
it's highly significant

49:16.451 --> 49:18.933
and likely to be true.

49:18.953 --> 49:20.935
Hundreds of detailed
tables and charts

49:20.955 --> 49:22.437
were included in the study.

49:22.457 --> 49:25.940
Each one presented the raw
data that was collected.

49:25.960 --> 49:27.962
Then this information
was cross-referenced

49:28.463 --> 49:30.945
in multiple ways to
demonstrate its reliability

49:30.965 --> 49:33.948
and to show how it linked
with the 367 variables

49:33.968 --> 49:35.950
the study examined.

49:35.970 --> 49:37.952
I think the major message

49:37.972 --> 49:44.459
we got out of all these
correlation analyses

49:44.479 --> 49:47.462
is only one message.

49:47.482 --> 49:49.964
The plant food-based diet,

49:49.984 --> 49:53.968
mainly cereal grains,
vegetables, and fruits,

49:53.988 --> 49:57.472
and very little animal food

49:57.492 --> 50:03.978
is always associated with lower
mortality of certain cancers,

50:03.998 --> 50:07.982
stroke, and coronary
heart disease.

50:08.002 --> 50:09.984
The New York times called it

50:10.004 --> 50:12.987
"the most comprehensive
large study ever undertaken

50:13.007 --> 50:14.489
"of the relationship
between diet

50:14.509 --> 50:17.011
and the risk of
developing disease."

50:17.512 --> 50:21.496
For Dr. Campbell, he finally had
large-scale data on people,

50:21.516 --> 50:25.500
and it was remarkably consistent
with his earlier discoveries.

50:25.520 --> 50:30.505
Together, he found that the
scientific evidence was clear:

50:30.525 --> 50:34.008
Whole, plant-based foods were
beneficial to human health,

50:34.028 --> 50:36.530
while animal-based
foods were not.

50:44.038 --> 50:46.521
San'dera nation's journey
to better health

50:46.541 --> 50:49.023
wasn't easy at first.

50:49.043 --> 50:51.526
It was a little hard, 'cause
I'd been eating fatty foods

50:51.546 --> 50:55.029
and grease and
everything for 38 years,

50:55.049 --> 50:57.532
you know, as long
as I can remember,

50:57.552 --> 51:00.555
so it was kinda hard
to go from that

51:01.055 --> 51:04.038
to changing the next
day completely.

51:04.058 --> 51:07.542
I started a journal for maybe
the first three weeks,

51:07.562 --> 51:10.044
write down my feelings
and emotions,

51:10.064 --> 51:12.547
what I felt like...
So that other people

51:12.567 --> 51:15.550
could know it's okay
to feel that way.

51:15.570 --> 51:17.552
Along the way,

51:17.572 --> 51:20.555
San'dera had strong support
from Dr. Esselstyn

51:20.575 --> 51:22.557
and his wife Ann.

51:22.577 --> 51:25.059
They keep in touch,
and they're like,

51:25.079 --> 51:26.561
"we haven't forgotten
about you,"

51:26.581 --> 51:28.062
and I know they haven't.

51:28.082 --> 51:30.565
I really feel here
that they haven't.

51:30.585 --> 51:32.567
"I went to Wal-Mart this day.

51:32.587 --> 51:34.068
"I had wanted a subway sandwich,

51:34.088 --> 51:36.070
"and I said I'm gonna get
me that meatball sub.

51:36.090 --> 51:39.574
"I then received a call
while I was at Wal-Mart

51:39.594 --> 51:42.076
"from Mrs. Esselstyn,

51:42.096 --> 51:46.080
"as if they knew I was
weak at this moment.

51:46.100 --> 51:48.082
"She stated, 'promise me

51:48.102 --> 51:51.085
"you will not eat
anything from Wal-Mart.'

51:51.105 --> 51:53.588
"it gave me chills to know that
she called at that moment.

51:53.608 --> 51:55.590
"Therefore I left the store

51:55.610 --> 51:57.612
without getting
that meatball sub."

51:58.613 --> 52:00.114
What do you see?

52:00.615 --> 52:03.598
While Dr. Campbell was
publishing his China study,

52:03.618 --> 52:06.601
Dr. Esselstyn was getting
some powerful data

52:06.621 --> 52:09.604
from the research
he'd started in 1985.

52:09.624 --> 52:12.106
He began with 24 patients,

52:12.126 --> 52:15.109
but 6 had dropped out
in the first year,

52:15.129 --> 52:17.111
leaving him with a total of 18.

52:17.131 --> 52:20.615
At the end of five years, we
had follow-up angiograms,

52:20.635 --> 52:23.117
and 11 of the group had
halted their disease.

52:23.137 --> 52:24.619
There was no progression.

52:24.639 --> 52:28.623
And there were four where we
had rather exciting evidence

52:28.643 --> 52:30.625
of regression of disease.

52:30.645 --> 52:32.627
These results were astonishing.

52:32.647 --> 52:36.130
The diet produced something
that medication and surgery

52:36.150 --> 52:41.135
never had before: Actual
reversals of heart disease.

52:41.155 --> 52:44.639
The biological mechanism
that caused these reversals

52:44.659 --> 52:47.161
centers on the lining of
our veins and arteries...

52:47.662 --> 52:49.644
the endothelial cells.

52:49.664 --> 52:51.646
They are the absolute
life jackets

52:51.666 --> 52:53.147
of our blood vessels.

52:53.167 --> 52:56.150
You're young, and you're a
teenager, you're healthy,

52:56.170 --> 52:58.653
you could spread those
out one layer thick,

52:58.673 --> 52:59.654
and you'd have something
that would cover

52:59.674 --> 53:01.656
six or eight tennis courts.

53:01.676 --> 53:04.659
In 1988, scientists discovered

53:04.679 --> 53:06.160
that endothelial
cells manufactured

53:06.180 --> 53:08.663
the gas nitric oxide.

53:08.683 --> 53:11.165
Well, what did nitric oxide do?

53:11.185 --> 53:16.170
Nitric oxide keeps our
blood flowing smoothly

53:16.190 --> 53:18.172
without being sticky.

53:18.192 --> 53:21.175
It also helps to dilate
constricted blood vessels

53:21.195 --> 53:22.677
during physical activity

53:22.697 --> 53:25.680
and inhibits the
formation of plaque.

53:25.700 --> 53:29.684
And most importantly, nitric
oxide is a powerful force

53:29.704 --> 53:33.187
for eliminating the inflammation

53:33.207 --> 53:35.690
that seems to go
with this plaque.

53:35.710 --> 53:38.693
However, scientific
tests have demonstrated

53:38.713 --> 53:41.195
that when we start eating
the typical Western diet,

53:41.215 --> 53:44.699
our endothelial
cells are damaged.

53:44.719 --> 53:47.702
When you're getting to be in
your 40s and 50s and 60s,

53:47.722 --> 53:50.705
and you've been slaughtering
your endothelial cells,

53:50.725 --> 53:52.707
you don't have those six
or eight tennis courts.

53:52.727 --> 53:54.709
You may be down to one
and a half or two,

53:54.729 --> 53:56.711
and they can't protect you.

53:56.731 --> 53:59.213
Yet according to Dr. Esselstyn,

53:59.233 --> 54:02.717
when we begin eating a whole
foods, plant-based diet,

54:02.737 --> 54:05.720
the damage to our endothelial
cells not only stops,

54:05.740 --> 54:08.242
it starts to reverse.

54:16.250 --> 54:18.733
About five years into his study,

54:18.753 --> 54:21.235
Esselstyn made a small
but significant change

54:21.255 --> 54:22.737
in his patients' menu.

54:22.757 --> 54:25.239
It started in 1990,

54:25.259 --> 54:28.242
when he read the glowing review
of Dr. Campbell's China study

54:28.262 --> 54:31.245
the New York times.

54:31.265 --> 54:33.247
Dr. Esselstyn saw that,

54:33.267 --> 54:35.249
and he invited me to
come to a conference

54:35.269 --> 54:37.251
he was organizing in Arizona.

54:37.271 --> 54:39.253
These two revolutionaries,

54:39.273 --> 54:42.757
who, up until then, had been
on similar but separate paths

54:42.777 --> 54:46.260
finally met face-to-face.

54:46.280 --> 54:48.282
On the one hand, I'm coming
from the scientific group,

54:48.783 --> 54:50.264
getting some ideas.

54:50.284 --> 54:51.766
He's coming from
the clinical route

54:51.786 --> 54:54.769
and doing some
dramatic research.

54:54.789 --> 54:57.772
Here's the science, here's
the clinical evidence.

54:57.792 --> 54:59.273
Put the two together,
it's amazing.

54:59.293 --> 55:01.776
When he learned of
Campbell's research,

55:01.796 --> 55:06.280
Esselstyn removed dairy products
from his patients' diet.

55:06.300 --> 55:09.283
The results of his ongoing study
continued to be impressive,

55:09.303 --> 55:11.786
and in 1995, he
published a paper

55:11.806 --> 55:15.289
detailing them in a noted
scientific journal.

55:15.309 --> 55:18.793
Yet one of Esselstyn's most
remarkable success stories

55:18.813 --> 55:21.295
involved a colleague of his
at the Cleveland clinic,

55:21.315 --> 55:23.798
Dr. Joseph Crowe.

55:23.818 --> 55:27.802
Actually I was, um,
active, healthy,

55:27.822 --> 55:29.303
very busy,

55:29.323 --> 55:34.809
uh, mid-40s, absolutely,
um, no risk factors

55:34.829 --> 55:39.313
at all for any heart problem.

55:39.333 --> 55:41.816
But Dr. Crowe, even with
what was considered to be

55:41.836 --> 55:43.818
a healthy cholesterol level,

55:43.838 --> 55:46.821
was actually ravaged
by heart disease.

55:46.841 --> 55:48.823
This angiogram,

55:48.843 --> 55:52.326
taken after his first nearly
fatal heart attack in 1996,

55:52.346 --> 55:54.328
shows how badly damaged

55:54.348 --> 55:56.831
one of his coronary
arteries was.

55:56.851 --> 55:59.834
This angiogram was done
after less than three years

55:59.854 --> 56:02.356
of entirely dietary treatment.

56:09.363 --> 56:11.365
Dr. Crowe was fortunate.

56:11.866 --> 56:14.348
In 25% of cases, sudden death

56:14.368 --> 56:19.353
is the first and only sign
of coronary artery disease.

56:19.373 --> 56:23.357
Of Dr. Esselstyn's
original 18 patients,

56:23.377 --> 56:26.861
all survived the initial
12 years of the study.

56:26.881 --> 56:29.864
Today, 14 patients
are still alive

56:29.884 --> 56:33.367
over two decades after
the study began.

56:33.387 --> 56:37.371
The thing about essy, although
he's always very pleasant,

56:37.391 --> 56:40.374
when you said, "I'm going
to be on this program

56:40.394 --> 56:41.895
and I'm going to stay
with this diet,"

56:42.396 --> 56:44.879
you stayed with the diet,
or there was the door.

56:44.899 --> 56:46.380
You had no choice.

56:46.400 --> 56:50.384
I mean, his smiles
are wonderful,

56:50.404 --> 56:51.886
but he is very stern.

56:51.906 --> 56:53.888
You know, that's why
I'm still living.

56:53.908 --> 56:55.890
But, you know, he's just...

56:55.910 --> 56:59.894
He's just a wonderful man.

56:59.914 --> 57:00.915
And I look at the pictures...

57:01.415 --> 57:04.418
Some of my pictures
years ago, 20 years ago

57:04.919 --> 57:06.901
actually looks older than today.

57:06.921 --> 57:10.905
The only thing is I lost
more hair, you know?

57:10.925 --> 57:12.907
Anthony and the
other male patients

57:12.927 --> 57:14.408
also noted another change.

57:14.428 --> 57:15.910
When you're young,

57:15.930 --> 57:17.411
when you were teenager,

57:17.431 --> 57:22.416
you see a female or so on,
it gets kind of excited.

57:22.436 --> 57:25.419
And the first
reaction physically,

57:25.439 --> 57:27.922
you know, it gets
attention, you know?

57:27.942 --> 57:29.924
Raise the flag, I call it.

57:29.944 --> 57:33.928
This happened to us,
all the other, uh,

57:33.948 --> 57:37.431
Dr. Esselstyn's, uh, I call
'em all the Guinea pigs.

57:37.451 --> 57:40.434
The flag still rises.

57:40.454 --> 57:42.937
Talking to your doctor about e.D.

57:42.957 --> 57:44.939
May be the last
thing you wanna do,

57:44.959 --> 57:46.941
but it's definitely a
conversation worth having.

57:46.961 --> 57:48.943
I'm a practicing urologist

57:48.963 --> 57:51.445
and have been so for
the last 25 years.

57:51.465 --> 57:53.467
And erectile dysfunction
is actually

57:53.968 --> 57:55.950
the first clinical indicator

57:55.970 --> 57:59.453
of generalized
cardiovascular disease.

57:59.473 --> 58:01.455
It's the canary
in the coal mine.

58:01.475 --> 58:02.957
It's the thing
that lets you know

58:02.977 --> 58:05.479
that you have some
significant endothelial

58:05.980 --> 58:07.461
and vascular disease,

58:07.481 --> 58:10.464
much earlier than
will a heart attack

58:10.484 --> 58:11.966
or something like that.

58:11.986 --> 58:13.467
We have to stop
thinking of the body

58:13.487 --> 58:15.970
like it's compartmentalized.
It really isn't.

58:15.990 --> 58:18.472
The blood goes
everywhere in the body.

58:18.492 --> 58:21.995
And so if you have
vascular disease anywhere,

58:22.496 --> 58:24.979
you have it everywhere.

58:24.999 --> 58:28.482
Despite the apparent success
of the dietary approach,

58:28.502 --> 58:34.488
some critics say eating
this way is extreme.

58:34.508 --> 58:37.491
Now, with the Western diet,

58:37.511 --> 58:39.493
this guarantees there
are gonna be what?

58:39.513 --> 58:41.495
A half a million people
in this country this year

58:41.515 --> 58:45.499
who will have to have the front
half of their body divided,

58:45.519 --> 58:48.002
their heart exposed,

58:48.022 --> 58:50.504
then veins will be
taken from their leg

58:50.524 --> 58:52.006
and sewed on their heart.

58:52.026 --> 58:54.508
Some people would
call that extreme.

58:54.528 --> 58:58.031
Dr. Esselstyn has now
successfully treated

58:58.532 --> 59:01.015
over 250 patients
with heart disease,

59:01.035 --> 59:05.519
using almost exclusively a
whole foods, plant-based diet.

59:05.539 --> 59:07.021
Heart disease, as far
as I'm concerned,

59:07.041 --> 59:10.024
is an absolutely
toothless paper tiger

59:10.044 --> 59:12.526
that need never, ever exist.

59:12.546 --> 59:16.550
And if it does exist, it
need never, ever progress.

59:40.574 --> 59:43.057
Las Vegas, Nevada.

59:43.077 --> 59:45.059
At the extreme couture gym,

59:45.079 --> 59:47.581
we found an extraordinary
plant-based athlete...

59:48.082 --> 59:51.065
ultimate fighter
champion Mac danzig.

59:51.085 --> 59:53.567
In the mixed martial arts world,

59:53.587 --> 59:56.070
strength, toughness,
and endurance

59:56.090 --> 59:58.592
are of Paramount importance,
and Mac has them all.

01:00:01.095 --> 01:00:04.598
I had cut dairy out of my diet
when I was about 18 years old,

01:00:05.099 --> 01:00:06.600
um, because I had a, uh...

01:00:07.101 --> 01:00:09.583
Ear, nose, and throat
allergy to dairy,

01:00:09.603 --> 01:00:11.085
and I was getting a
lot of ear infections

01:00:11.105 --> 01:00:12.586
and things like that.

01:00:12.606 --> 01:00:15.589
So when I cut that out,
really the only thing

01:00:15.609 --> 01:00:18.592
that was separating me
from having a vegan diet

01:00:18.612 --> 01:00:19.593
was chicken and fish.

01:00:19.613 --> 01:00:21.095
So I was just eating
that for years,

01:00:21.115 --> 01:00:24.098
and I was eating it because
I thought that I needed to,

01:00:24.118 --> 01:00:26.100
because everyone
tells you, you know,

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.601
if you're an athlete,
you need, you know,

01:00:27.621 --> 01:00:30.104
at least chicken and fish
in your diet for protein.

01:00:30.124 --> 01:00:32.106
You know, something that's
just one of the myths

01:00:32.126 --> 01:00:34.628
that's been perpetuated
for a while.

01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:39.613
All it took was me cutting
the chicken and fish out,

01:00:39.633 --> 01:00:40.614
and I did it cold Turkey.

01:00:40.634 --> 01:00:43.117
I think a lot of people,
stereotypically speaking,

01:00:43.137 --> 01:00:45.119
think someone that's
a vegan is, like,

01:00:45.139 --> 01:00:46.620
some skinny hippie
type of person,

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.123
and, uh, you know,
I'm not necessarily

01:00:49.143 --> 01:00:51.125
trying to break the stereotype.

01:00:51.145 --> 01:00:54.628
I just... I tried the diet
for my own personal reasons,

01:00:54.648 --> 01:00:55.649
and it worked for me,

01:00:59.153 --> 01:01:00.134
I feel like I have more energy

01:01:00.154 --> 01:01:02.636
now that I don't eat
the meat products.

01:01:02.656 --> 01:01:06.660
And I also feel like I recover
better in between my workouts.

01:01:08.162 --> 01:01:11.145
I'm not trying to be part
of some exclusive club

01:01:11.165 --> 01:01:12.646
or anything like that.

01:01:12.666 --> 01:01:15.649
I'm just doing my
thing, and, um,

01:01:15.669 --> 01:01:18.152
you know, don't plan on
eating meat or dairy

01:01:18.172 --> 01:01:20.174
or anything like that for
the rest of my life.

01:01:23.677 --> 01:01:27.661
This, uh, guide is called the
type "a" planning guide.

01:01:27.681 --> 01:01:31.165
Now, it includes
foods that are found

01:01:31.185 --> 01:01:32.666
in the basic four food groups,

01:01:32.686 --> 01:01:36.170
because we are concerned
about the total daily needs,

01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:37.191
and this is a part of it.

01:01:37.691 --> 01:01:40.674
We must serve 1/2 pint
of fresh fluid milk

01:01:40.694 --> 01:01:45.679
to provide calcium, riboflavin,

01:01:45.699 --> 01:01:49.683
and the other nutrients that
are needed for our children.

01:01:49.703 --> 01:01:50.684
For decades,

01:01:50.704 --> 01:01:52.706
the dairy industry and U.
S. government

01:01:53.207 --> 01:01:56.190
have been saying that milk
is good for our bones.

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:59.193
While all whole foods
contain calcium,

01:01:59.213 --> 01:02:01.695
an essential nutrient
for bone health,

01:02:01.715 --> 01:02:03.697
it is argued that we
need the higher amounts

01:02:03.717 --> 01:02:05.199
found in dairy.

01:02:05.219 --> 01:02:07.701
Children and aging
women in particular

01:02:07.721 --> 01:02:13.207
have been singled out to drink
more and more and more milk.

01:02:13.227 --> 01:02:14.708
What do you think the
most important nutrient

01:02:14.728 --> 01:02:16.229
we get from dairy
products is, like milk?

01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:17.711
Calcium.

01:02:17.731 --> 01:02:19.213
- Calcium.
- Calcium.

01:02:19.233 --> 01:02:20.234
- Calcium.
- Calcium.

01:02:20.734 --> 01:02:22.216
- Calcium.
- Calcium.

01:02:22.236 --> 01:02:23.217
Calcium.

01:02:23.237 --> 01:02:24.238
Calcium.

01:02:25.739 --> 01:02:29.723
The science in terms of
dairy's role in healthy bones

01:02:29.743 --> 01:02:30.744
is pretty strong,

01:02:31.245 --> 01:02:33.247
and, in fact, the national
osteoporosis foundation,

01:02:33.747 --> 01:02:36.730
of course, utilizes that science
in their recommendations.

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:39.733
Osteoporosis is a
degenerative bone disease,

01:02:39.753 --> 01:02:43.237
which has been widely linked
to a lack of calcium.

01:02:43.257 --> 01:02:46.740
If this is true, nations with a
high intake of dairy products,

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.743
which are a major source of
calcium in a westernized diet,

01:02:49.763 --> 01:02:53.747
should have low levels
of osteoporosis.

01:02:53.767 --> 01:02:55.749
But according to a study

01:02:55.769 --> 01:02:58.252
done by a distinguished
Harvard researcher,

01:02:58.272 --> 01:03:01.255
nations with high levels
of calcium intake

01:03:01.275 --> 01:03:03.257
tend to have high levels
of hip fractures,

01:03:03.277 --> 01:03:07.261
which is a key indicator
for osteoporosis.

01:03:07.281 --> 01:03:10.264
And so, in fact, the higher
the dairy consumption,

01:03:10.284 --> 01:03:12.266
the higher the rate
of osteoporosis...

01:03:12.286 --> 01:03:14.268
exactly the opposite of
what the dairy industry

01:03:14.288 --> 01:03:16.770
has been telling us for so long.

01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:20.774
One of the primary mechanisms
for that is that animal protein

01:03:20.794 --> 01:03:23.777
tends to create an acid-like
condition in the body

01:03:23.797 --> 01:03:26.280
called metabolic acidosis.

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:27.781
To combat this condition,

01:03:27.801 --> 01:03:32.286
the body draws upon its most
readily available acid buffer,

01:03:32.306 --> 01:03:34.788
namely calcium in our bones.

01:03:34.808 --> 01:03:38.292
As the calcium is extracted to
neutralize the excess acid,

01:03:38.312 --> 01:03:40.794
our bones are weakened.

01:03:40.814 --> 01:03:43.797
In defending the health
benefits of milk,

01:03:43.817 --> 01:03:46.800
many national health
organizations now recommend

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:49.303
that we consume low-fat
dairy products.

01:03:49.323 --> 01:03:51.805
It can be milk,
it can be yogurt,

01:03:51.825 --> 01:03:55.309
it can be cheese, it can be
anything made from milk.

01:03:55.329 --> 01:03:58.312
But again, the
important message,

01:03:58.332 --> 01:03:59.313
it's a message that comes

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:01.315
from the American
Dietetic Association,

01:04:01.335 --> 01:04:04.818
the National Osteoporosis
Foundation, Cancer, Heart,

01:04:04.838 --> 01:04:06.820
we're all on the same page.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.823
It needs to be
low-fat or fat-free.

01:04:09.843 --> 01:04:11.325
So as the fat's taken out,

01:04:11.345 --> 01:04:15.829
the protein becomes a larger
proportion of the total.

01:04:15.849 --> 01:04:19.833
So they become higher in
protein, lower in fat.

01:04:19.853 --> 01:04:22.836
And when we compare
these high-protein,

01:04:22.856 --> 01:04:25.339
low-fat milk products,
for example,

01:04:25.359 --> 01:04:26.840
with prostate cancer,

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:28.862
the relationship is
as strong as it is

01:04:29.363 --> 01:04:30.864
for cigarette smoking
and lung cancer.

01:04:33.867 --> 01:04:36.350
Most of these animals here
are what we call heifers.

01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:37.351
Uh-huh.

01:04:37.371 --> 01:04:39.853
They're the young
females, not yet cows.

01:04:39.873 --> 01:04:41.855
So they haven't had
their first calf yet.

01:04:41.875 --> 01:04:42.856
Haven't had their first calf.

01:04:42.876 --> 01:04:44.358
So they have to have
their first calf

01:04:44.378 --> 01:04:45.359
before they can lactate.

01:04:45.379 --> 01:04:46.360
And once they come
into lactation,

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:47.861
they almost keep
them, these days,

01:04:47.881 --> 01:04:49.363
they keep them
pregnant continuously

01:04:49.383 --> 01:04:50.864
for three of four years.

01:04:50.884 --> 01:04:52.866
Why are they eating grass now?

01:04:52.886 --> 01:04:54.368
Well, this is the last
time, in their lifetime,

01:04:54.388 --> 01:04:55.869
they're going to see grass.

01:04:55.889 --> 01:04:56.890
After that they're in the barn,

01:04:57.391 --> 01:04:59.873
they're standing up for
the rest of their life.

01:04:59.893 --> 01:05:02.876
When I was young, we
defended our product,

01:05:02.896 --> 01:05:03.877
promoted our product,

01:05:03.897 --> 01:05:05.879
because it was nature's
most perfect food.

01:05:05.899 --> 01:05:09.383
And, uh, so I believed that.

01:05:09.403 --> 01:05:12.886
But it took a slightly different
twist as time passed.

01:05:12.906 --> 01:05:15.889
I mean, it's the most
perfect food for calves.

01:05:15.909 --> 01:05:18.392
And trying to switch the milk of
one species to another species

01:05:18.412 --> 01:05:20.414
doesn't make a lotta sense.

01:05:23.917 --> 01:05:26.400
Only two months
into her treatment,

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:28.902
San'dera was experiencing
dramatic effects

01:05:28.922 --> 01:05:32.906
on her type 2 diabetes
and hypertension.

01:05:32.926 --> 01:05:35.428
Since I've been on a
plant-based diet,

01:05:35.929 --> 01:05:37.911
blood pressure's been wonderful.

01:05:37.931 --> 01:05:40.414
My blood sugars are in the 80s.

01:05:40.434 --> 01:05:41.915
It shocks me, 70s.

01:05:41.935 --> 01:05:43.917
So I was alarmed when it was 60.

01:05:43.937 --> 01:05:46.920
I'm like, "aah!
Isn't that bad? It's 60?"

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:48.922
You know, and I talked to
the diabetes educator,

01:05:48.942 --> 01:05:49.923
which is wonderful.

01:05:49.943 --> 01:05:52.426
She's like, "no, that's
a normal blood sugar."

01:05:52.446 --> 01:05:55.429
You're pancreas is working,
it's reversing."

01:05:55.449 --> 01:05:57.431
Ironically, San'dera works

01:05:57.451 --> 01:05:59.933
at an outpatient
facility for diabetics.

01:05:59.953 --> 01:06:01.935
Yet the treatment that was

01:06:01.955 --> 01:06:03.937
achieving success
with her diabetes

01:06:03.957 --> 01:06:06.940
came from outside the
established medical system.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.443
The positive results
went far beyond

01:06:09.463 --> 01:06:11.945
San'dera's chronic diseases.

01:06:11.965 --> 01:06:14.448
Mentally, not having
the sluggishness,

01:06:14.468 --> 01:06:17.451
the fear of the
disease progressing.

01:06:17.471 --> 01:06:18.952
Because I feel I'm in control

01:06:18.972 --> 01:06:21.455
and have power of taking
it back the right way now.

01:06:21.475 --> 01:06:24.458
So, mentally, I feel great.

01:06:24.478 --> 01:06:26.460
I'm eating the
things I should eat.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.462
The one thing that is
true that Ann said to me,

01:06:28.482 --> 01:06:29.963
"you really start tasting

01:06:29.983 --> 01:06:31.484
the real taste of
what you're eating,"

01:06:31.985 --> 01:06:33.467
cause I'd eat a peach,
and you'd think...

01:06:33.487 --> 01:06:36.970
I was in heaven with
my white peaches.

01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:37.971
I get to eat,

01:06:37.991 --> 01:06:39.973
and that feels good
to be able to eat,

01:06:39.993 --> 01:06:41.475
bringing the sugar down,

01:06:41.495 --> 01:06:42.976
you're losing the weight,

01:06:42.996 --> 01:06:44.978
your whole everything changes.

01:06:44.998 --> 01:06:46.499
You know, I think we're
a little dependent

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.483
on, you know, our doctors
and the medications.

01:06:49.503 --> 01:06:51.485
We should take a little
bit more responsibility

01:06:51.505 --> 01:06:52.986
and check it out for ourselves.

01:06:53.006 --> 01:06:55.489
And speaking of doctors
and medications,

01:06:55.509 --> 01:06:57.991
how does San'dera's
regular physician

01:06:58.011 --> 01:06:59.493
feel about her new lifestyle?

01:06:59.513 --> 01:07:01.995
When I recently approached her

01:07:02.015 --> 01:07:05.499
about my blood sugars
being so great,

01:07:05.519 --> 01:07:11.004
my question was, "should I
not take my medication?"

01:07:11.024 --> 01:07:13.507
She said, "no, you still
take your medications."

01:07:13.527 --> 01:07:17.511
And she said, "what is
that doctor trying to do?

01:07:17.531 --> 01:07:19.513
Take you off your medications?"

01:07:19.533 --> 01:07:24.518
And I'm looking like, "yeah,
I'm hoping that's the...

01:07:24.538 --> 01:07:26.019
The goal."

01:07:26.039 --> 01:07:30.023
So there's still people we
have to make believers, yeah.

01:07:32.546 --> 01:07:36.029
Sally and Jim eat their
breakfast at about 7:00.

01:07:36.049 --> 01:07:39.533
It's a good breakfast of
good foundation foods.

01:07:39.553 --> 01:07:42.536
Today, they're
having milk, cereal,

01:07:42.556 --> 01:07:45.038
poached eggs, and
sliced oranges.

01:07:45.058 --> 01:07:47.040
They are starting the day right.

01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:49.543
The key agency that sets

01:07:49.563 --> 01:07:51.545
nutritional guidelines
for Americans

01:07:51.565 --> 01:07:54.548
is the United States
department of agriculture.

01:07:54.568 --> 01:07:57.551
The u.S.D.A.
Helps determine what foods are served

01:07:57.571 --> 01:07:59.553
to everyone from our
soldiers in the field

01:07:59.573 --> 01:08:03.056
to our kids in their
school cafeterias.

01:08:03.076 --> 01:08:05.578
These guidelines are also
taught in our schools,

01:08:06.079 --> 01:08:08.061
influencing what our
children will eat

01:08:08.081 --> 01:08:10.063
for the rest of their lives.

01:08:10.083 --> 01:08:12.585
Dr. David klurfeld is a
nutritional scientist

01:08:13.086 --> 01:08:15.569
and national program
leader for human nutrition

01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:19.072
with the u.S.D.A.
'S agricultural research service.

01:08:19.091 --> 01:08:21.073
We've made dietary
recommendations

01:08:21.094 --> 01:08:24.077
since the 1890s, from u.S.D.A.

01:08:24.096 --> 01:08:27.080
And that was before we knew
about vitamins and minerals.

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:30.584
Subsequently, we've had
different food groups,

01:08:30.604 --> 01:08:32.586
and we had the basic 4

01:08:32.606 --> 01:08:34.107
and 5 and 7 and 12,

01:08:34.608 --> 01:08:36.590
and it varied as the
science changed.

01:08:36.609 --> 01:08:39.091
Perhaps the best known
of the food groups

01:08:39.112 --> 01:08:42.595
was the "basic four",
introduced in 1956

01:08:42.616 --> 01:08:44.598
in a leaflet called
"food for fitness."

01:08:44.618 --> 01:08:48.602
The mainstay of nutrition
education for over 30 years,

01:08:48.622 --> 01:08:50.103
the basic four defined

01:08:50.122 --> 01:08:52.104
what an entire
generation of Americans

01:08:52.125 --> 01:08:54.608
believed was healthy to eat.

01:08:54.627 --> 01:08:57.611
The four food groups
was replaced in 1992

01:08:57.631 --> 01:09:02.616
by the "food pyramid," then
updated by "my pyramid."

01:09:02.636 --> 01:09:04.117
These guidelines recommend

01:09:04.136 --> 01:09:06.620
three servings of dairy
products per day,

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.624
and meat is still a primary
source of protein.

01:09:10.644 --> 01:09:14.627
In following "my pyramid
," a 15-year-old girl

01:09:14.648 --> 01:09:16.129
can eat a daily menu consisting

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:19.131
of a bowl of lucky
charms with low-fat milk

01:09:19.152 --> 01:09:22.636
and a glass of orange juice
from concentrate for breakfast,

01:09:22.656 --> 01:09:24.638
cheese-flavored crackers
for a morning snack,

01:09:24.658 --> 01:09:27.140
a cheeseburger on
a whole-grain bun

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.643
with French-fries and
a coke for lunch,

01:09:29.662 --> 01:09:32.145
chocolate pudding and grapes
for an afternoon snack,

01:09:32.165 --> 01:09:34.147
and chicken nuggets
with a biscuit

01:09:34.167 --> 01:09:36.149
and canned green
beans for dinner

01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:38.671
with low-fat ice
cream for dessert.

01:09:40.173 --> 01:09:43.156
I see now what's
happening with the way

01:09:43.176 --> 01:09:46.660
that we feed many of our
children in our school systems.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.162
We shouldn't be surprised that
we're seeing childhood obesity

01:09:50.183 --> 01:09:51.665
at the rates that
we're seeing it.

01:09:51.685 --> 01:09:54.668
Dr. Neal barnard is a
medical researcher

01:09:54.688 --> 01:09:57.170
and president of the
physicians committee

01:09:57.190 --> 01:09:58.672
for responsible medicine.

01:09:58.692 --> 01:10:01.675
Well, the problem is, when
a kid is pulling his tray

01:10:01.695 --> 01:10:03.176
down the school lunch line,

01:10:03.196 --> 01:10:05.679
you see federal
policies in action.

01:10:05.699 --> 01:10:07.681
There are burgers
topped with cheese,

01:10:07.701 --> 01:10:09.683
the milk is heavily subsidized.

01:10:09.703 --> 01:10:12.686
But the vegetables and fruits,
a little bit harder to find.

01:10:12.706 --> 01:10:14.688
And this is because the
government contracts

01:10:14.708 --> 01:10:17.691
are going to particularly
the meat producers

01:10:17.711 --> 01:10:19.192
and other producers as well.

01:10:19.212 --> 01:10:20.694
It has nothing to do with
the health of the children.

01:10:20.714 --> 01:10:23.216
It has all to do with
the financial health

01:10:23.717 --> 01:10:25.719
of the big
agribusiness entities.

01:10:26.219 --> 01:10:28.201
What we have with the u.S.D.A.

01:10:28.221 --> 01:10:30.723
Is it's really a farmers
advocacy organization.

01:10:31.224 --> 01:10:33.206
And, okay let's have one,

01:10:33.226 --> 01:10:36.710
but that same group cannot
advocate for farmers,

01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:39.713
help subsidize their operations,

01:10:39.733 --> 01:10:41.214
manage commodity foods,

01:10:41.234 --> 01:10:43.717
subsidize the price
of growing things,

01:10:43.737 --> 01:10:44.718
and then turn around and say,

01:10:44.738 --> 01:10:46.720
"okay, we're going to
tell people what to eat."

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.221
They're going to tell
people what to eat

01:10:48.241 --> 01:10:49.242
based on their constituents,

01:10:49.743 --> 01:10:51.725
which are the farmers,
not the American public.

01:10:51.745 --> 01:10:55.729
In 1998, barnard's group sued the u.
S.D.A.

01:10:55.749 --> 01:10:58.231
Every five years, the
government reformulates

01:10:58.251 --> 01:10:59.733
the dietary guidelines
for Americans.

01:10:59.753 --> 01:11:02.235
That's the blueprint of what
Americans are supposed to eat

01:11:02.255 --> 01:11:03.737
to be healthy.

01:11:03.757 --> 01:11:08.241
And we looked at the panel that
pulled it together... 11 people.

01:11:08.261 --> 01:11:11.244
6 of the 11 had
financial relationships

01:11:11.264 --> 01:11:12.765
with the food industry.

01:11:13.266 --> 01:11:14.247
So we said, hey, wait a minute.

01:11:14.267 --> 01:11:16.750
There are laws about what
they're supposed to do

01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:19.252
and how transparent they
are supposed to be.

01:11:19.272 --> 01:11:20.253
They violated those.

01:11:20.273 --> 01:11:22.255
And we brought them to court,

01:11:22.275 --> 01:11:25.759
and it was a long
trial, but we won.

01:11:25.779 --> 01:11:27.260
But that doesn't change the fact

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.762
that the policies
they came up with

01:11:28.782 --> 01:11:30.764
continued to favor industry
as they always have.

01:11:30.784 --> 01:11:33.266
I don't think there
really is a problem

01:11:33.286 --> 01:11:36.770
with industry connections
between scientists

01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:38.772
and the food industry,

01:11:38.792 --> 01:11:42.295
primarily because if
the beef industry

01:11:42.796 --> 01:11:44.778
has a question about
their products,

01:11:44.798 --> 01:11:48.281
shouldn't they go to
the best scientists?

01:11:48.301 --> 01:11:49.783
And if the best scientists

01:11:49.803 --> 01:11:52.285
are consulting for
the food industry,

01:11:52.305 --> 01:11:57.791
I still want the best
scientists on these committees

01:11:57.811 --> 01:11:59.793
that make nutritional
recommendations.

01:11:59.813 --> 01:12:01.795
Financial conflict of interest

01:12:01.815 --> 01:12:04.798
is only one conflict
of interest.

01:12:04.818 --> 01:12:05.799
You know, there are people

01:12:05.819 --> 01:12:07.801
who've spent their
entire careers

01:12:07.821 --> 01:12:11.805
trying to prove that a
vegetarian diet is good for you

01:12:11.825 --> 01:12:13.326
or that red meat is bad for you.

01:12:13.827 --> 01:12:15.809
Now, they may not
have industry ties,

01:12:15.829 --> 01:12:18.812
but they too have a
conflict of interest.

01:12:18.832 --> 01:12:21.314
You know, we do develop
biases personally.

01:12:21.334 --> 01:12:22.816
I had those biases, too.

01:12:22.836 --> 01:12:25.819
But I got to a
point in my career

01:12:25.839 --> 01:12:28.822
that I was getting results
that went against

01:12:28.842 --> 01:12:30.824
what I had thought was true.

01:12:30.844 --> 01:12:36.850
So I had to self-reflect,
criticize my own bias,

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:38.832
look at it really carefully,

01:12:38.852 --> 01:12:40.834
and I changed my views.

01:12:40.854 --> 01:12:44.337
Dr. Campbell paid a price
for changing his views.

01:12:44.357 --> 01:12:45.839
He's been marginalized

01:12:45.859 --> 01:12:48.842
by key administrators
of his own university,

01:12:48.862 --> 01:12:50.844
this after being
a lead scientist

01:12:50.864 --> 01:12:53.346
and securing millions of
dollars in research grants

01:12:53.366 --> 01:12:56.349
for Cornell's nutritional
sciences division.

01:12:56.369 --> 01:12:58.351
He had a popular
nutrition course

01:12:58.371 --> 01:13:00.353
canceled by the
division director

01:13:00.373 --> 01:13:01.855
who had long been a
major consultant

01:13:01.875 --> 01:13:03.857
to the dairy industry.

01:13:03.877 --> 01:13:07.360
Numerous observers feel this
was an arbitrary decision

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:10.363
that violated the standards
of academic freedom.

01:13:10.383 --> 01:13:14.367
Dr. Campbell has also witnessed
serious corporate influence

01:13:14.387 --> 01:13:15.888
over research that
is used to develop

01:13:16.389 --> 01:13:18.371
the government's
nutrition policy.

01:13:18.391 --> 01:13:20.874
One example he cites centers on

01:13:20.894 --> 01:13:23.877
the prestigious national
academy of sciences.

01:13:23.897 --> 01:13:26.379
The building behind
me here is perhaps

01:13:26.399 --> 01:13:28.901
the single most
important building

01:13:29.402 --> 01:13:30.884
in the area of science
in the country.

01:13:30.904 --> 01:13:33.887
This is where scientists
participate in deliberations

01:13:33.907 --> 01:13:35.388
about issues of the day

01:13:35.408 --> 01:13:39.412
and determine how that science
can be used to affect policy.

01:13:39.913 --> 01:13:41.394
In the early days
when I was involved,

01:13:41.414 --> 01:13:44.898
those panels were mostly
funded by public money.

01:13:44.918 --> 01:13:47.400
But on the other hand,
in more recent years,

01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:49.903
I have seen more and
more corporate money

01:13:49.923 --> 01:13:52.405
coming in to support
these activities

01:13:52.425 --> 01:13:55.408
and more and more people being
allowed on the committees,

01:13:55.428 --> 01:13:57.410
especially the chairs
of the committee.

01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:58.912
And, of course, they can
pick the kind of people

01:13:58.932 --> 01:14:00.413
they want to pick

01:14:00.433 --> 01:14:01.915
in order to get a certain
kind of conclusion.

01:14:01.935 --> 01:14:03.917
It's not the way it should be,

01:14:03.937 --> 01:14:05.919
and I'm sure that if the
public were to know

01:14:05.939 --> 01:14:09.943
how powerful is this influence,
they would be surely upset.

01:14:29.462 --> 01:14:31.464
I had been a runner
for 14 years,

01:14:31.965 --> 01:14:33.446
in fact, a marathoner.

01:14:33.466 --> 01:14:36.449
47 years old, the
top of my game.

01:14:36.469 --> 01:14:39.953
In 1982, Ruth heidrich's
running career

01:14:39.973 --> 01:14:40.954
came to a sudden stop

01:14:40.974 --> 01:14:43.456
when she was diagnosed
with breast cancer.

01:14:43.476 --> 01:14:47.460
After a mastectomy, her doctors
recommended chemotherapy

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.962
and radiation to
treat the cancer

01:14:48.982 --> 01:14:51.965
that had by then spread
to her lungs and bones.

01:14:51.985 --> 01:14:55.468
Ruth decided to visit
Dr. John Mcdougall instead.

01:14:55.488 --> 01:14:57.971
And I said, "Ruth, I
spent my residency

01:14:57.991 --> 01:14:59.973
"collecting information on
diet and breast cancer.

01:14:59.993 --> 01:15:01.995
"It's all in these
files right here.

01:15:02.495 --> 01:15:03.977
"Sit in my office
and read through it

01:15:03.997 --> 01:15:04.978
and see what you think."

01:15:04.998 --> 01:15:07.480
He said, "these are the
studies that show...

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.982
"what I'm trying to prove

01:15:09.002 --> 01:15:12.485
is that diet can reverse
breast cancer."

01:15:12.505 --> 01:15:14.487
And she read it,

01:15:14.507 --> 01:15:16.489
and she comes out and she says
"okay, I've changed my diet."

01:15:16.509 --> 01:15:17.510
She changed her diet.

01:15:18.011 --> 01:15:19.993
So he showed me how to eat.

01:15:20.013 --> 01:15:24.497
No added oils, lots of fruits
and vegetables, whole grains.

01:15:24.517 --> 01:15:26.499
Ruth then started training

01:15:26.519 --> 01:15:29.002
for the ironman
triathlon in Hawaii,

01:15:29.022 --> 01:15:31.004
which combines
running a marathon

01:15:31.024 --> 01:15:34.507
with long-distance
biking and swimming.

01:15:34.527 --> 01:15:36.509
I became obsessed.

01:15:36.529 --> 01:15:38.511
Kept up the running, of
course, never stopped,

01:15:38.531 --> 01:15:40.513
and then added swimming, biking,

01:15:40.533 --> 01:15:43.016
and, for good measure,
lifted weights.

01:15:43.036 --> 01:15:45.518
And people were saying,
"you're crazy.

01:15:45.538 --> 01:15:48.021
You're a cancer patient.
You should be resting."

01:15:48.041 --> 01:15:48.521
Doctors told me this.

01:15:48.541 --> 01:15:50.523
I felt so good.

01:15:50.543 --> 01:15:53.026
I felt fit, and I wanted to
maintain that level of fitness.

01:15:53.046 --> 01:15:56.029
And I felt sure that if
I had a healthy body

01:15:56.049 --> 01:15:58.531
and I was putting the
right food into it

01:15:58.551 --> 01:16:01.534
that I could beat this cancer.

01:16:01.554 --> 01:16:05.038
At the ironman triathlon,

01:16:05.058 --> 01:16:08.041
Ruth won a gold medal
in her age group.

01:16:08.061 --> 01:16:10.043
Stuck with the diet.

01:16:10.063 --> 01:16:12.045
Found out my arthritis
disappeared.

01:16:12.065 --> 01:16:14.047
My constipation disappeared.

01:16:14.067 --> 01:16:15.548
My dandruff disappeared.

01:16:15.568 --> 01:16:17.050
No sign of depression,

01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:19.572
which you might expect
with a cancer diagnosis.

01:16:20.073 --> 01:16:23.556
I felt renewed, invigorated,

01:16:23.576 --> 01:16:27.560
and out to show that diet
is so much more important

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.063
than anybody ever thought.

01:16:30.083 --> 01:16:31.564
Mmm!

01:16:31.584 --> 01:16:33.066
Other women get
over breast cancer,

01:16:33.086 --> 01:16:35.068
colon cancer, prostate cancer.

01:16:35.088 --> 01:16:36.589
There are people who've had
metastatic prostate cancer

01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:38.571
all over their body

01:16:38.591 --> 01:16:40.593
who have gone through what we
call spontaneous remission.

01:16:41.094 --> 01:16:42.575
In other words,
they've been cured.

01:16:42.595 --> 01:16:43.576
And it's not the
end of the world

01:16:43.596 --> 01:16:45.578
when you get this diagnosis.
Some people get over it.

01:16:45.598 --> 01:16:46.599
Ruth did.

01:16:48.601 --> 01:16:50.583
So I'm still racing.

01:16:50.603 --> 01:16:52.585
Still daily training.

01:16:52.605 --> 01:16:55.588
Now how many people in their
70s are doing triathlons?

01:16:55.608 --> 01:16:57.090
Not very many.

01:16:57.110 --> 01:17:00.093
So that gives hope for
all of us as we age

01:17:00.113 --> 01:17:02.595
that not only will
you stay healthy

01:17:02.615 --> 01:17:06.599
and beat the degenerative
diseases that most people get,

01:17:06.619 --> 01:17:09.121
but you can start
collecting medals.

01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:19.112
The food choices we make

01:17:19.132 --> 01:17:21.134
have profound global effects.

01:17:24.637 --> 01:17:27.120
It takes over ten times
the amount of energy

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:30.623
from fossil fuels to produce a
calorie of animal-based food

01:17:30.643 --> 01:17:33.626
than it does to produce a
calorie of plant food.

01:17:33.646 --> 01:17:37.630
Since the 1970s, 20% of
the Amazon's rainforest

01:17:37.650 --> 01:17:39.151
has been destroyed.

01:17:39.652 --> 01:17:42.635
That's an area the
size of California.

01:17:42.655 --> 01:17:47.640
80% of this cleared land is
now occupied by livestock.

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:50.643
The world's cattle alone
eat enough grain to feed

01:17:50.663 --> 01:17:53.146
8.7 billion people,

01:17:53.166 --> 01:17:57.650
nearly 2 billion more than
the population on earth.

01:17:57.670 --> 01:17:59.652
With almost a billion
malnourished people

01:17:59.672 --> 01:18:03.156
across the globe, redirecting
even a portion of the grain

01:18:03.176 --> 01:18:05.658
used to fatten cattle could feed

01:18:05.678 --> 01:18:09.682
every hungry mouth
on the planet.

01:18:10.183 --> 01:18:13.666
For Gene Baur,
factors like these,

01:18:13.686 --> 01:18:15.668
combined with a deep
respect for animals,

01:18:15.688 --> 01:18:18.671
helped convince him to
adopt a plant-based diet.

01:18:18.691 --> 01:18:22.175
Mr. Baur is president and
co-founder of farm sanctuary

01:18:22.195 --> 01:18:24.677
near Watkins Glen, New York.

01:18:24.697 --> 01:18:27.180
It provides a safe
haven for animals

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.682
that have been
abandoned or abused.

01:18:29.702 --> 01:18:33.186
I grew up eating animals like
most people in our country,

01:18:33.206 --> 01:18:36.689
but once I started
considering my food choices

01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:39.192
I recognized that I didn't
want to eat animals.

01:18:39.212 --> 01:18:42.695
And the more I learned,
the more I saw

01:18:42.715 --> 01:18:45.698
that I was healthier if
I didn't eat animals

01:18:45.718 --> 01:18:48.201
and that I had a much lighter
footprint on our planet.

01:18:48.221 --> 01:18:50.203
The livestock industry
is a greater contributor

01:18:50.223 --> 01:18:51.724
to global warming than the
entire transportation industry

01:18:52.225 --> 01:18:53.706
according to the United Nations.

01:18:53.726 --> 01:18:57.710
So by eating meat, milk,
and eggs the way we are,

01:18:57.730 --> 01:18:59.712
we're harming our own health,

01:18:59.732 --> 01:19:03.216
we're slaughtering 10
billion innocent animals

01:19:03.236 --> 01:19:04.217
every year in the U.S.,

01:19:04.237 --> 01:19:05.718
and we're destroying the planet.

01:19:05.738 --> 01:19:08.741
Statistics compiled
from the United Nations

01:19:09.242 --> 01:19:10.723
and the World
Health Organization

01:19:10.743 --> 01:19:12.725
demonstrate the
profound global effect

01:19:12.745 --> 01:19:15.228
that diet has on health.

01:19:15.248 --> 01:19:17.730
These are the estimated
amounts of animal foods

01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:19.732
produced in nine countries,

01:19:19.752 --> 01:19:23.736
a figure that's closely related
to animal food consumption.

01:19:23.756 --> 01:19:26.739
These are the numbers of deaths
due to heart disease and cancer

01:19:26.759 --> 01:19:29.261
in the same countries.

01:19:31.764 --> 01:19:33.246
In the United States,

01:19:33.266 --> 01:19:37.250
the very same diseases continue
to have a grave impact.

01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:38.751
Even with the
billions of dollars

01:19:38.771 --> 01:19:40.753
spent on cardiac treatment,

01:19:40.773 --> 01:19:43.756
heart disease is still the
number one cause of death,

01:19:43.776 --> 01:19:47.760
killing over 600,000
people a year.

01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:49.762
And the elephant in the room,

01:19:49.782 --> 01:19:53.266
when we talk about stents
and heart bypass surgery,

01:19:53.286 --> 01:19:55.788
is the fact that while
it's no question

01:19:56.289 --> 01:19:57.270
in an emergency,

01:19:57.290 --> 01:20:00.273
these procedures are
absolutely lifesaving.

01:20:00.293 --> 01:20:02.275
But when they're
done electively,

01:20:02.295 --> 01:20:06.279
these procedures do not protect
from new heart attacks.

01:20:06.299 --> 01:20:08.281
Stents and bypass operations

01:20:08.301 --> 01:20:10.783
are used mainly to treat
large arterial blockages.

01:20:10.803 --> 01:20:14.787
Yet according to many
research studies,

01:20:14.807 --> 01:20:16.789
only a small percentage
of heart attacks

01:20:16.809 --> 01:20:19.792
are caused by the largest
build-ups of plaque.

01:20:19.812 --> 01:20:22.795
The rest are caused by the
more numerous, newer blockages

01:20:22.815 --> 01:20:24.297
that are far more inflamed

01:20:24.317 --> 01:20:26.299
and much more likely to rupture

01:20:26.319 --> 01:20:30.303
than the larger, older,
more stable plaques.

01:20:30.323 --> 01:20:33.306
And so this is why
those procedures

01:20:33.326 --> 01:20:34.807
don't treat the disease.

01:20:34.827 --> 01:20:36.328
They are treating symptoms.

01:20:38.331 --> 01:20:41.314
Doctor Esselstyn has been
eating the same foods

01:20:41.334 --> 01:20:45.818
that he has recommended to his
patients for over 25 years.

01:20:45.838 --> 01:20:49.822
One of his sons, Rip Esselstyn,
used a plant-based diet

01:20:49.842 --> 01:20:51.824
to fuel a successful
ten-year career

01:20:51.844 --> 01:20:53.345
as a professional tri-athlete.

01:20:53.846 --> 01:20:57.349
When Rip turned 34, he was
ready for a career change

01:20:57.850 --> 01:21:00.352
and trained to become
a firefighter.

01:21:05.358 --> 01:21:07.840
Rip was assigned to
engine company number 2

01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:09.842
in Austin, Texas.

01:21:09.862 --> 01:21:13.346
We're incredibly competitive
here at the fire station,

01:21:13.366 --> 01:21:14.847
and we love making bets.

01:21:14.867 --> 01:21:16.849
So we were out on the
porch one night,

01:21:16.869 --> 01:21:18.851
and we kind of made
this little bar bet

01:21:18.871 --> 01:21:20.853
to see who had the lowest
cholesterol level.

01:21:20.873 --> 01:21:24.857
So the next morning, we
drove to a lab, got tested,

01:21:24.877 --> 01:21:26.859
and the results came back.

01:21:26.879 --> 01:21:29.862
And it lead to a
discovery that J.R.,

01:21:29.882 --> 01:21:33.866
James Ray, our resident redneck,
had a cholesterol of 344.

01:21:33.886 --> 01:21:36.369
Pretty much means you're
knocking at death's door.

01:21:36.389 --> 01:21:39.872
And so what we did, in
an act of solidarity,

01:21:39.892 --> 01:21:43.876
is the next day we went about
eating a plant-strong diet,

01:21:43.896 --> 01:21:46.398
to basically save his life
and save his arteries.

01:21:46.899 --> 01:21:49.902
The men agreed to change
their firehouse diet.

01:21:50.403 --> 01:21:53.886
But in Texas, old
eating habits die hard.

01:21:53.906 --> 01:21:56.389
Meat's almost a sport in Texas.

01:21:56.409 --> 01:21:58.891
I have several good friends
that, they're barbeque teams.

01:21:58.911 --> 01:21:59.892
That's what they do.

01:21:59.912 --> 01:22:01.894
That's their sport on weekends.

01:22:01.914 --> 01:22:03.396
Texans are serious
about their barbeque.

01:22:03.416 --> 01:22:04.917
Texas, Kansas.

01:22:14.927 --> 01:22:18.911
Well, guys associate being
manly with eating meat.

01:22:18.931 --> 01:22:21.414
And if you're a firefighter,
it's exponentially so.

01:22:21.434 --> 01:22:26.919
Last year, for example, there
were 133 firefighter fatalities

01:22:26.939 --> 01:22:28.421
in the United States.

01:22:28.441 --> 01:22:32.425
52% were from heart disease.

01:22:32.445 --> 01:22:35.928
Our number one killer of
in-the-line-of-duty deaths

01:22:35.948 --> 01:22:37.930
for firefighters
is heart disease.

01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:40.433
After just three weeks
on his new diet,

01:22:40.453 --> 01:22:42.935
j.R.
Tested his blood cholesterol,

01:22:42.955 --> 01:22:47.440
and it dropped 148 points,
a decrease of 43%.

01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:49.942
His results inspired the others,

01:22:49.962 --> 01:22:51.944
who also saw their
cholesterol drop

01:22:51.964 --> 01:22:54.447
and their energy levels rise.

01:22:54.467 --> 01:22:57.450
As firemen, they were not
only helping themselves,

01:22:57.470 --> 01:23:00.953
they were in better
shape to assist others.

01:23:00.973 --> 01:23:02.455
One of the things about
being a firefighter

01:23:02.475 --> 01:23:04.957
is you don't have any idea
what your next call could be.

01:23:04.977 --> 01:23:06.959
We may have a high-rise alarm,

01:23:06.979 --> 01:23:09.462
where we have to go up
20 flights of stairs

01:23:09.482 --> 01:23:10.963
with air packs on,

01:23:10.983 --> 01:23:12.465
with all of our bunker gear on,

01:23:12.485 --> 01:23:14.967
with a high rise
pack on our backs.

01:23:14.987 --> 01:23:16.969
Anybody can go down the poll,

01:23:16.989 --> 01:23:19.972
but not everybody can go up,
especially without their legs.

01:23:19.992 --> 01:23:22.975
And right there
you're talking about

01:23:22.995 --> 01:23:25.978
an additional 75 to 100 pounds

01:23:25.998 --> 01:23:27.480
that you have to carry
up 20 flights of stairs.

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.482
You have to have an
amazing aerobic capacity

01:23:29.502 --> 01:23:30.983
and strength in
order to do that.

01:23:31.003 --> 01:23:34.987
Real...Men...Eat...Plants.

01:23:35.007 --> 01:23:38.991
Real...Men...Eat...Plants.

01:23:41.013 --> 01:23:43.496
You know what, as firefighters,

01:23:43.516 --> 01:23:46.999
everybody thinks that we
fight fire, and we do.

01:23:47.019 --> 01:23:50.503
But over 70% of our calls
are medical emergencies

01:23:50.523 --> 01:23:54.006
where we are responding
to heart disease,

01:23:54.026 --> 01:23:58.010
hypertension, type 2
diabetes, rampant obesity.

01:23:58.030 --> 01:24:01.514
And so we see, up
close and personal,

01:24:01.534 --> 01:24:03.516
basically the destruction
that's being caused

01:24:03.536 --> 01:24:05.538
by the standard American diet.

01:24:06.038 --> 01:24:07.539
To me, the answer

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:10.523
is just absolutely so
simple, it's criminal.

01:24:10.543 --> 01:24:13.025
It's just people
starting to take

01:24:13.045 --> 01:24:14.527
responsibility for their health

01:24:14.547 --> 01:24:18.030
and starting to eat
more plant-based foods.

01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:19.551
It's that simple.

01:24:22.555 --> 01:24:26.038
After 13 weeks on a whole
foods, plant-based diet,

01:24:26.058 --> 01:24:29.061
it was time to get my results
from Dr. Lederman.

01:24:29.562 --> 01:24:33.045
When you started, your
weight was 231, 231 pounds,

01:24:33.065 --> 01:24:34.547
now 211 pounds.

01:24:34.567 --> 01:24:36.048
Okay, that's good.

01:24:36.068 --> 01:24:37.550
- It's a 20-pound drop there.
- Wow.

01:24:37.570 --> 01:24:39.572
Your blood pressure was 142
over 82 when you started.

01:24:40.072 --> 01:24:41.554
It's now 112 over 70.

01:24:41.574 --> 01:24:43.556
Wow. That's a big drop.

01:24:43.576 --> 01:24:45.057
That's a nice drop.
Oh, yeah, that's...

01:24:45.077 --> 01:24:47.079
that's great, and, uh,
it'll just keep getting...

01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:50.062
It'll keep dropping as
you continue to do this.

01:24:50.082 --> 01:24:52.565
Your pulse was resting
at 92 when you started.

01:24:52.585 --> 01:24:55.067
It's now down to 60, resting.

01:24:55.087 --> 01:24:56.569
Okay, cool.

01:24:56.589 --> 01:25:01.574
Your total cholesterol though
went from 241 down to 154.

01:25:01.594 --> 01:25:03.075
What?

01:25:03.095 --> 01:25:05.077
Yeah, that was pretty amazing.

01:25:05.097 --> 01:25:07.079
241 down to 154.

01:25:07.099 --> 01:25:08.581
154?

01:25:08.601 --> 01:25:09.582
154, yeah, that's really...

01:25:09.602 --> 01:25:12.084
and your LDL, which is
your bad cholesterol...

01:25:12.104 --> 01:25:14.587
um, I think this is the
most impressive...

01:25:14.607 --> 01:25:17.089
went from 157 down to 80.

01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:18.591
No way!

01:25:18.611 --> 01:25:21.594
Yeah. That's amazing that
it dropped almost in half.

01:25:21.614 --> 01:25:23.095
Uh, we did C.R.P. Last time,

01:25:23.115 --> 01:25:24.597
which is sort of the
marker of the inflammation

01:25:24.617 --> 01:25:26.599
in the heart and
the blood vessels.

01:25:26.619 --> 01:25:30.603
And that went from
6.0 down to 2.8.

01:25:30.623 --> 01:25:32.605
Without using any medications,

01:25:32.625 --> 01:25:35.608
I significantly
reduced my chances

01:25:35.628 --> 01:25:38.631
of getting a heart attack
and many other diseases.

01:25:41.133 --> 01:25:44.116
Tomorrow marks 20
weeks on the program.

01:25:44.136 --> 01:25:46.118
I've lost 45 pounds.

01:25:46.138 --> 01:25:47.639
I've reversed the diabetes.

01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:49.622
You have to know that everybody

01:25:49.642 --> 01:25:52.625
is so incredibly proud
of what you've done.

01:25:52.645 --> 01:25:54.126
I don't have to rely
on the medication.

01:25:54.146 --> 01:25:57.129
I have a lot of energy
that I didn't have before.

01:25:57.149 --> 01:26:00.132
My children love it.

01:26:00.152 --> 01:26:02.635
They're so proud of me, and
they tell me all the time.

01:26:02.655 --> 01:26:04.637
I had a little saying
that I've carried around

01:26:04.657 --> 01:26:07.139
for maybe the last two years.

01:26:07.159 --> 01:26:08.140
And it's "win the war.

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.662
"Do not let one lost
battle end the war.

01:26:11.163 --> 01:26:14.666
"If you do break down and give
into temptation, do not quit.

01:26:15.167 --> 01:26:16.649
"Just get right back on track.

01:26:16.669 --> 01:26:19.151
Not tomorrow, but right now."

01:26:19.171 --> 01:26:20.653
The diabetes is not coming back.

01:26:20.673 --> 01:26:21.654
I'm not gonna let it come back,

01:26:21.674 --> 01:26:23.155
nor the weight.

01:26:23.175 --> 01:26:26.158
The message is, you're
in control of your life.

01:26:26.178 --> 01:26:29.662
Joey Aucoin had over two
dozen health problems,

01:26:29.682 --> 01:26:32.164
including type 2 diabetes.

01:26:32.184 --> 01:26:35.668
But after 22 weeks eating
plant-based foods,

01:26:35.688 --> 01:26:38.170
his condition had
changed dramatically.

01:26:38.190 --> 01:26:39.672
Hey, how you doin'?

01:26:39.692 --> 01:26:41.674
- Back again.
- And you're getting healthier.

01:26:41.694 --> 01:26:44.176
Your weight is down 28 pounds.

01:26:44.196 --> 01:26:45.678
You feel better than you have.

01:26:45.698 --> 01:26:49.682
26 out of 27 complaints
are gone completely.

01:26:49.702 --> 01:26:51.684
Your marker of inflammation
in the vessels

01:26:51.704 --> 01:26:53.686
is down to that of
a normal person.

01:26:53.706 --> 01:26:56.188
Uh, your blood sugars
are coming down.

01:26:56.208 --> 01:26:57.709
They continue to come down
even on a daily basis,

01:26:58.210 --> 01:26:59.692
which are gonna get better.

01:26:59.712 --> 01:27:01.694
Your cholesterol is
significantly lower

01:27:01.714 --> 01:27:03.696
than it was when
you first started,

01:27:03.716 --> 01:27:05.197
before you ever started
taking any pills.

01:27:05.217 --> 01:27:06.699
Your blood pressure
is normal now,

01:27:06.719 --> 01:27:09.201
compared to how it was
before while on pills.

01:27:09.221 --> 01:27:10.703
It was still elevated.

01:27:10.723 --> 01:27:13.205
And you just...
you know, you just said

01:27:13.225 --> 01:27:14.707
you've never felt
like this before.

01:27:14.727 --> 01:27:16.709
You look...
look at how you look in the pictures.

01:27:16.729 --> 01:27:17.710
You look healthier.

01:27:17.730 --> 01:27:19.211
So, you know, like
I told you before,

01:27:19.231 --> 01:27:20.713
I explained how the
numbers can affect...

01:27:20.733 --> 01:27:23.215
can affect our judgment
of what real health is.

01:27:23.235 --> 01:27:24.717
And it's not just the numbers.

01:27:24.737 --> 01:27:25.718
It's overall the entire picture,

01:27:25.738 --> 01:27:28.220
and your picture
looks fantastic.

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:30.222
I was takin' nine pills
a day and two shots.

01:27:30.242 --> 01:27:33.726
I was spending almost a 150
to 200 a month on medication,

01:27:33.746 --> 01:27:35.227
above my insurance.

01:27:35.247 --> 01:27:37.730
Just think about that: I've
been doin' it five months.

01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:40.733
I've saved, you know,
$800 to a $1000 already,

01:27:40.753 --> 01:27:43.235
'cause I haven't taken
one pill, one shot.

01:27:43.255 --> 01:27:44.737
So think about what
that saved me...

01:27:44.757 --> 01:27:46.739
not just me, the
insurance company.

01:27:46.759 --> 01:27:48.240
The U.S. government will
give you figures

01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:51.744
that 75% of the dollars
spent in health care

01:27:51.764 --> 01:27:53.245
are due to chronic illnesses,

01:27:53.265 --> 01:27:54.747
and these are due to
diet and lifestyle.

01:27:54.767 --> 01:27:56.268
Let's get rid of the problem,

01:27:56.769 --> 01:27:58.771
which is the sickness which
is caused by the food.

01:28:09.782 --> 01:28:12.264
Now well into their 70s,

01:28:12.284 --> 01:28:15.787
doctors Campbell and Esselstyn
are both vital and active.

01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:20.773
They also continue to
spread their message.

01:28:20.793 --> 01:28:23.275
If you carefully look
at our school children,

01:28:23.295 --> 01:28:25.778
already the arteries
to their brain,

01:28:25.798 --> 01:28:29.782
their carotid artery, is getting
some intimal medial thickening.

01:28:29.802 --> 01:28:32.284
Dr. Esselstyn lectures
about his research

01:28:32.304 --> 01:28:35.287
all over the United
States and abroad.

01:28:35.307 --> 01:28:37.790
His wife Ann frequently
accompanies him

01:28:37.810 --> 01:28:38.791
to help council patients

01:28:38.811 --> 01:28:40.793
and to demonstrate
the preparation

01:28:40.813 --> 01:28:42.795
of plant-based foods.

01:28:42.815 --> 01:28:44.797
Dr. Esselstyn is also director

01:28:44.817 --> 01:28:48.300
of the cardiovascular disease
prevention and reversal program

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:51.804
at the Cleveland clinic's
Wellness Institute.

01:28:51.824 --> 01:28:55.307
Like Dr. Esselstyn, Dr. Campbell

01:28:55.327 --> 01:28:58.811
continues to lecture
throughout America and beyond.

01:28:58.831 --> 01:29:01.814
Dr. Campbell, you believe that
even if animal-based proteins,

01:29:01.834 --> 01:29:05.818
meat, dairy, et cetera...
are free from contamination,

01:29:05.838 --> 01:29:07.820
you don't think people
should eat them?

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:09.321
No, I don't.

01:29:09.341 --> 01:29:11.824
I think the closer we get
to a plant-based diet...

01:29:11.844 --> 01:29:14.326
I should say a whole-foods,
plant-based diet,

01:29:14.346 --> 01:29:17.830
the healthier we're going
to be for all of us.

01:29:17.850 --> 01:29:20.833
In China, where Dr. Campbell

01:29:20.853 --> 01:29:22.835
did his large study
a generation ago,

01:29:22.855 --> 01:29:25.838
the population has experienced
dramatic increases

01:29:25.858 --> 01:29:28.340
in the amount of meat,
dairy, and processed foods

01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:30.843
the average person consumes.

01:29:30.863 --> 01:29:31.864
At the same time,

01:29:32.364 --> 01:29:35.848
the rates of degenerative
diseases are skyrocketing.

01:29:35.868 --> 01:29:38.350
Many Chinese now share
some of the same beliefs

01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:40.872
Americans have about nutrition.

01:29:51.884 --> 01:29:54.366
Dr. Campbell's message
is resonating

01:29:54.386 --> 01:29:55.868
with growing numbers
of concerned people

01:29:55.888 --> 01:29:57.389
around the world.

01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:59.872
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

01:29:59.892 --> 01:30:03.375
Thanks to the efforts
of both these pioneers

01:30:03.395 --> 01:30:04.376
and their colleagues,

01:30:04.396 --> 01:30:06.378
thousands of people
are realizing

01:30:06.398 --> 01:30:07.880
that profound improvements

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:11.383
in health and quality of
life are within reach.

01:30:11.403 --> 01:30:13.886
You have two choices:

01:30:13.906 --> 01:30:18.390
You can eat yourself into
poor health and early death,

01:30:18.410 --> 01:30:21.894
or you can eat yourself
into good health

01:30:21.914 --> 01:30:23.896
and a long, healthy life.

01:30:23.916 --> 01:30:28.901
And that road is on a plant-
centered dietary pattern.

01:30:28.921 --> 01:30:32.905
You know, I know of
nothing else in medicine

01:30:32.925 --> 01:30:35.908
that can come close to what
a plant-based diet can do.

01:30:35.928 --> 01:30:37.910
I can say this with a
great deal of confidence,

01:30:37.930 --> 01:30:41.413
that our national authorities
are simply excluding

01:30:41.433 --> 01:30:43.916
this concept of nutrition from
the debate and the discussion

01:30:43.936 --> 01:30:46.418
in order to protect
the status quo.

01:30:46.438 --> 01:30:49.421
In theory, if everyone
were to adopt this,

01:30:49.441 --> 01:30:53.425
I really believe we could cut
health care costs by 70% to 80%.

01:30:53.445 --> 01:30:54.446
That's amazing.

01:30:54.947 --> 01:30:57.950
And it all comes from
understanding nutrition,

01:30:58.450 --> 01:31:02.454
applying nutrition, and
just watchin' the results.

01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.962
The greatest gift that
you could possibly give

01:31:11.463 --> 01:31:12.945
to yourself and your family,

01:31:12.965 --> 01:31:15.948
not only those in
your generation,

01:31:15.968 --> 01:31:18.450
but your children and
your grandchildren,

01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:20.953
if you can make them be aware

01:31:20.973 --> 01:31:24.957
of the incredible power that
resides within each of them

01:31:24.977 --> 01:31:29.962
to avoid life's most poignantly
tragic and painful events,

01:31:29.982 --> 01:31:32.965
you just don't have to have
those kinds of events.

01:31:32.985 --> 01:31:35.467
I believe that
with all my heart,

01:31:35.487 --> 01:31:36.969
if anyone listen to this,

01:31:36.989 --> 01:31:40.973
and they really should look
at their refrigerator,

01:31:40.993 --> 01:31:43.475
and look at their
diet, and give a try.

01:31:43.495 --> 01:31:45.978
You lose weight, and
you'll be healthier.

01:31:45.998 --> 01:31:47.980
Nothing could lose

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.482
if you just take
few weeks and try.

01:31:50.502 --> 01:31:52.985
You could see how easy it is.

01:31:53.005 --> 01:31:55.487
I'm not gonna say
it was difficult.

01:31:55.507 --> 01:31:57.990
Again, I made up my mind,
this is what I'm going to do.

01:31:58.010 --> 01:32:01.493
I never felt like I wasn't
getting what I wanted.

01:32:01.513 --> 01:32:03.996
So I didn't have ice cream, so
I didn't have the doughnuts,

01:32:04.016 --> 01:32:05.497
so I ate something else.

01:32:05.517 --> 01:32:08.000
I can thank them in every
way I can think possible,

01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:09.501
and my doctor, especially Matt,

01:32:09.521 --> 01:32:11.503
and they just can't
understand what it's done

01:32:11.523 --> 01:32:12.524
to change my life.

01:32:13.025 --> 01:32:14.006
And it really has.

01:32:14.026 --> 01:32:15.507
Not just mine, my
family's, everybody's.

01:32:15.527 --> 01:32:18.010
It gives me shivers
talking about it,

01:32:18.030 --> 01:32:19.511
because it's so serious.

01:32:19.531 --> 01:32:21.013
It's a life-changing experience.

01:32:21.033 --> 01:32:23.535
You can be in control,

01:32:24.036 --> 01:32:25.517
and I stress this, 'cause
there's so many things

01:32:25.537 --> 01:32:28.020
going on in my life that
I'm not in control of.

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:29.021
And that's my message.

01:32:29.041 --> 01:32:32.524
You can control your
outcome of your body.

01:32:32.544 --> 01:32:36.528
Eat to live and
don't live to eat.

01:32:36.548 --> 01:32:38.030
You better get that.

01:32:38.050 --> 01:32:39.551
You better get the recipe.

01:32:40.052 --> 01:32:42.054
