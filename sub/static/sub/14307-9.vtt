00:03.533 --> 00:06.400
(male narrator)
Previously, on a
very special Clone High...

00:06.400 --> 00:10.300
This is a really long episode,
so I'm gonna go fast.

00:10.300 --> 00:11.733
Joan likes Abe.
Abe's dating Cleo.

00:11.733 --> 00:12.867
It's a crazy love triangle.

00:12.867 --> 00:14.433
Let's start the show.

00:14.433 --> 00:16.800
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

00:16.800 --> 00:19.733
* Secret government employees

00:19.733 --> 00:22.633
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

00:22.633 --> 00:25.667
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

00:25.667 --> 00:28.467
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

00:28.467 --> 00:31.300
* They're going to make it
if they try *

00:31.300 --> 00:34.533
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

00:34.533 --> 00:40.533
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *

00:40.533 --> 00:43.267
* Clone High

00:43.267 --> 00:48.933
* Clone High

00:48.933 --> 00:52.933
(Toots)
It all started
when folks around here

00:52.933 --> 00:55.433
noticed a storm was a-brewing.

00:55.433 --> 00:56.667
[dramatic music]

00:56.667 --> 00:59.300
[shutters clanging]

00:59.300 --> 01:00.367
[shutters slam shut]

01:00.367 --> 01:01.633
Brr.

01:01.633 --> 01:03.467
Storm's a-brewing.

01:03.467 --> 01:05.867
[chair creaking]

01:05.867 --> 01:08.700
[lightning cracking]

01:08.700 --> 01:11.633
Storm's a-brewing.

01:11.633 --> 01:13.633
[lightning cracks]

01:13.633 --> 01:15.733
Storm's a-brewing...

01:15.733 --> 01:17.200
in my heart.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.200
[door creaks]

01:18.200 --> 01:19.967
[slurred]
Cleopatra.

01:19.967 --> 01:22.067
I thought I told you--

01:22.067 --> 01:23.400
Oh, spin the bottle.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.333
Can I play?

01:25.467 --> 01:26.467
[lightning cracks]

01:26.467 --> 01:27.533
Now, listen here.

01:27.533 --> 01:29.433
I may be blind,

01:29.433 --> 01:32.233
but don't worry about
this storm, Joan of Arc.

01:32.233 --> 01:35.400
I built this house
like Noah built his ark:

01:35.400 --> 01:36.700
ready for a flood.

01:36.700 --> 01:37.700
Yep.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.167
This house...

01:39.167 --> 01:40.233
is flood-proof.

01:40.233 --> 01:41.767
[lightning cracks]

01:41.767 --> 01:44.767
[fire crackling]

01:44.767 --> 01:46.733
It's gone, Toots.

01:46.733 --> 01:49.067
All gone.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.700
What a terrible flood.

01:50.700 --> 01:51.867
[oar screeching]

01:51.867 --> 01:53.067
Holler when you see land,
Joanie.

01:53.067 --> 01:54.067
[oar screeching]

01:54.067 --> 01:55.300
Holler when you see land.

01:55.300 --> 01:56.300
[oar screeching]

01:56.300 --> 01:59.300
[rock music]

01:59.300 --> 02:00.933
*

02:00.933 --> 02:02.300
(Abe)
Joan, are you okay?

02:02.300 --> 02:04.433
We heard about
your house burning down.

02:04.433 --> 02:05.433
It's okay, Abe.

02:05.433 --> 02:06.800
I don't need
your pity.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.067
Is it true you're living
under the gym bleachers?

02:09.067 --> 02:11.067
And I really
don't need your pity.

02:11.067 --> 02:12.900
So where do we put
the canned goods?

02:12.900 --> 02:14.700
'Cause I brought you
some beef broth.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.133
It's still good, just dented.

02:16.133 --> 02:17.400
I'm a vegetarian.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.433
And here's a musty old
Hypercolor shirt

02:19.433 --> 02:20.700
I found in our dust rag drawer.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.333
I know it's out of style,

02:22.333 --> 02:25.567
but you poor people don't care
about that sort of thing, right?

02:25.567 --> 02:27.500
I'll can you good,
I will.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.500
Girls.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.100
Girls, please.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.300
You know how I feel
about conflict.

02:32.300 --> 02:34.200
I'm against it.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.733
Now, I love you both.

02:35.733 --> 02:37.400
One in a completely
platonic way,

02:37.400 --> 02:39.100
the other with a fiery passion

02:39.100 --> 02:41.867
that most people know
but once in a lifetime.

02:41.867 --> 02:43.400
By the way,
that one's not you, Joan.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.600
It's Cleo.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.633
Well, I'm glad
we had this talk.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.500
Now, let's never
speak of this again.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.367
[shoes pattering]

02:50.367 --> 02:52.767
Mail call.

02:52.767 --> 02:54.300
[gasps]

02:54.300 --> 02:56.767
Oh, calligraphy!

02:56.767 --> 02:57.767
[gasps]

02:57.767 --> 02:59.467
I've finally been invited

02:59.467 --> 03:03.167
to the annual high society
principal's ball.

03:03.167 --> 03:05.700
This year, it's being held
in the ballroom

03:05.700 --> 03:07.267
at the local pie factory.

03:07.267 --> 03:09.400
So much classier than
the ballroom

03:09.400 --> 03:11.567
at the seltzer factory.

03:11.567 --> 03:16.067
Mr. Butlertron, I'd be honored
if you'd be my plus one.

03:16.067 --> 03:18.633
I'm walking on sunshine.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.533
Whoa-whoa.

03:22.633 --> 03:25.967
(both)
High society, here we come.

03:25.967 --> 03:27.200
- Yippety ta-ta.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.433
- Yippety ta-ta.
- * Yip, ta-ta

03:28.433 --> 03:30.300
- Yippety ta-ta.
- * Yip, ta-ta

03:30.300 --> 03:32.233
[rock music]

03:32.233 --> 03:34.233
Welcome to the Grassy Knoll.

03:34.233 --> 03:37.767
Try our new smoothie,
the Jack Ruby red berry blast.

03:37.767 --> 03:39.067
Sure.

03:39.067 --> 03:40.700
Can I, err,
uh...

03:40.700 --> 03:42.633
add melons to that?

03:42.633 --> 03:44.067
[laughs]

03:44.067 --> 03:45.167
Melons.

03:45.167 --> 03:46.867
And, uh...

03:46.867 --> 03:47.867
coconuts?

03:47.867 --> 03:48.867
(Gandhi)
Yeah!

03:48.867 --> 03:50.867
Can I get yams?

03:50.867 --> 03:52.633
Hey, find your own joke, shorty.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.467
The booby bit is mine.

03:54.467 --> 03:58.133
I would like to add
some cans of milk.

03:58.133 --> 03:59.133
[laughs]

03:59.133 --> 04:00.200
Yeah!

04:00.200 --> 04:01.867
And some jugs
of cream.

04:01.867 --> 04:02.867
[laughs]

04:02.867 --> 04:04.267
That's it, pal.

04:04.267 --> 04:07.133
You just ordered yourself up
a knuckle sandwich.

04:07.133 --> 04:08.900
(all)
Fight! Fight!
Fight!

04:08.900 --> 04:10.867
- Fight! Fight!
- Oh, my God!

04:10.867 --> 04:11.900
Fight!

04:11.900 --> 04:14.067
Guys, guys, please!

04:14.067 --> 04:16.200
I have the DNA
of Abraham Lincoln.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.867
Resolving disputes
is in my nature.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.633
Now, why don't we all take
a deep breath.

04:20.633 --> 04:21.900
[Gandhi grunting]

04:21.900 --> 04:24.367
How do you like
that berry blast?

04:24.367 --> 04:26.667
And by berry blast,
I mean...

04:26.667 --> 04:29.300
a blast to your berries.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.300
[laughs]

04:30.300 --> 04:31.300
[spits]

04:31.300 --> 04:32.467
Pun thief.

04:32.467 --> 04:33.733
Huh.

04:33.733 --> 04:37.867
Conflict mediation seminar,
here I come.

04:37.867 --> 04:39.633
(King, Jr.)
I had a dream.

04:39.633 --> 04:43.067
A dream we'd have
ham and cheese sandwiches

04:43.067 --> 04:44.267
for lunch.

04:44.267 --> 04:46.867
But, Moses, you are shattering
my dream.

04:46.867 --> 04:49.533
But Martin Luther King, Jr.

04:49.533 --> 04:51.267
You know I'm a Jew

04:51.267 --> 04:54.067
and also
lactose intolerant.

04:54.067 --> 04:55.700
Freeze!

04:55.700 --> 04:59.300
Now let's resolve this fight
using conflict mediation.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.833
Try passing this egg
from one spoon to another

05:02.833 --> 05:04.400
using only your mouths.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.500
[metal clinks]

05:07.500 --> 05:08.767
Wow.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.833
I never saw it from
that perspective before.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.133
Me either.

05:13.133 --> 05:17.067
I now realize I should
be more tolerant of lactose.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.067
[applause]

05:19.067 --> 05:21.067
Welcome home, Abe.

05:21.067 --> 05:23.067
Welcome home.

05:23.067 --> 05:24.333
- Yippety ta-ta.
- * Yip, ta-ta

05:24.333 --> 05:26.067
- Yippety ta-ta.
- * Yip, ta-ta

05:26.067 --> 05:27.067
Principal Scudworth.

05:27.067 --> 05:28.067
[singing stops abruptly]

05:28.067 --> 05:30.400
I trust we're not...

05:30.400 --> 05:31.333
interrupting.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.667
Um...

05:33.667 --> 05:34.900
No.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.533
We have a little present
for you, Cinnamon.

05:36.533 --> 05:38.767
It's a token of our thanks
for going one full year

05:38.767 --> 05:40.533
without planning
your own suspicious plot

05:40.533 --> 05:42.133
behind our backs.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.367
[door creaks]

05:44.367 --> 05:45.600
[Principal Scudworth gasps]

05:45.600 --> 05:48.567
A toy robotic dog?

05:48.567 --> 05:50.500
The perfect present!

05:50.500 --> 05:53.733
Clearly expensive, yet something
I would never buy for myself.

05:53.733 --> 05:55.067
It shows you care

05:55.067 --> 05:58.067
but don't really know
anything about me.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.300
I love it!

05:59.300 --> 06:01.833
His name is ECyboPooch.

06:01.833 --> 06:03.067
Finally!

06:03.067 --> 06:06.567
A robot to love
and call my very own.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.133
[squeaks]

06:08.133 --> 06:09.133
What?

06:09.133 --> 06:10.167
[electronic whirr]

06:10.167 --> 06:11.800
(Cleopatra)
Okay, guys.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.067
With the nonperishable foods,
keep in mind

06:14.067 --> 06:16.367
that you can totally take
the wrapper off cat food,

06:16.367 --> 06:17.467
and they'll think it's tuna.

06:17.467 --> 06:18.900
(Toots)
Mm-mm.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.833
Joan, your friends
sure are generous.

06:20.833 --> 06:22.733
Wait.
Cleo is not my friend.

06:22.733 --> 06:24.833
That ho bag is just
pretending to care

06:24.833 --> 06:27.067
to make me feel even worse
about being homeless.

06:27.067 --> 06:30.233
Well, you don't have to worry
about that anymore, Joanie.

06:30.233 --> 06:32.900
'Cause I found us
a big old house to live in.

06:32.900 --> 06:33.900
Really?

06:33.900 --> 06:35.300
Now, as you know,

06:35.300 --> 06:37.067
I've been courting
a fine-looking lady friend

06:37.067 --> 06:38.567
for a while now.

06:38.567 --> 06:41.900
And she's generously offered
to let us move into her home.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.867
Cleo's drunk foster mom,

06:43.867 --> 06:45.100
come on out here, girl.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.433
[grunting]

06:46.433 --> 06:47.833
Cleo's mom?

06:47.833 --> 06:50.367
She has a daughter
about your age too.

06:50.367 --> 06:52.800
Now, I don't really recall
the girl's name.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.867
Something like
Cle-gloo--

06:54.867 --> 06:56.133
Cledis--
Cle--Cledis.

06:56.133 --> 06:57.467
That's it--Cledis.
Her name's Cledis.

06:57.467 --> 06:58.667
No, that's not it.

06:58.667 --> 07:00.933
Anyway, I'm sure you two
will get along.

07:00.933 --> 07:02.067

a-brewing.

07:15.467 --> 07:16.467

07:16.467 --> 07:18.100
Metaphorically, too.

[humming]

07:20.300 --> 07:21.867
[slurping]

07:21.867 --> 07:23.967
It's so nice I don't have to
drive all the way over here

07:23.967 --> 07:26.233
when I want to make sweet,
sweaty music with you,

07:26.233 --> 07:28.600
Cleo's drunk foster mom.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.733
[whispering]
I got to speak in code

07:30.733 --> 07:33.633
so the kids don't know
what I'm talking about.

07:33.633 --> 07:36.633
[grunting]

07:36.633 --> 07:37.567
How you like that there?

07:39.400 --> 07:41.833
I never thought hell
would be this pink.

07:41.833 --> 07:42.933
[drawer squeaks]

07:42.933 --> 07:45.433
You can put all your stuff
in here.

07:45.433 --> 07:46.833
If we're gonna
share a room,

07:46.833 --> 07:49.800
I just need you to sign
this confidentiality agreement.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.967
It prohibits you
from discussing such things

07:51.967 --> 07:53.600
as my pre-makeup
morning face

07:53.600 --> 07:55.800
and my mid-afternoon
bowel movement.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.967
Hey, hey.

07:56.967 --> 07:58.633
How are my two favorite girls?

07:58.633 --> 08:00.067
Abe, remind me.

08:00.067 --> 08:02.100
Now, do you like Cleo
'cause she's conceited

08:02.100 --> 08:03.933
or 'cause she's a whore?

08:03.933 --> 08:05.900
[laughing]
Whoa!

08:05.900 --> 08:06.900
[laughs]

08:06.900 --> 08:07.900
Yeah, and Abe.

08:07.900 --> 08:09.367
Remind me.

08:09.367 --> 08:11.367
Is Joan your best friend
because of some elaborate joke,

08:11.367 --> 08:12.367
or is it sympathy?

08:12.367 --> 08:14.633
[laughs heartily]

08:14.633 --> 08:16.333
That's rich.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.500
But, seriously,

08:17.500 --> 08:19.567
maybe I can help
resolve your conflict

08:19.567 --> 08:22.433
in an efficient,
yet ineffectual manner.

08:22.433 --> 08:24.433
Who's up for a trust game?

08:26.367 --> 08:28.700
Joan, you fall backwards
into Cleo's arms.

08:28.700 --> 08:31.667
And, Cleo, you catch Joan
to show she can rely on you.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.567
I'm so confident you two
can work this out,

08:33.567 --> 08:36.300
I'm not even gonna stay
to watch the magic.

08:36.300 --> 08:37.700
Proceed.

Oh, Wesley.

08:46.733 --> 08:49.300
I can't wait
for the principal's ball.

08:49.300 --> 08:52.167
I hammered out the dents
in my good tuxedo.

08:52.167 --> 08:54.067
Not now, Mr. B.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.300
I'm learning how to use
ECyboPooch.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.633
Ooh.

08:57.633 --> 09:00.367
It says if you
stroke his sensor,

09:00.367 --> 09:03.133
he wags his tail.

09:03.133 --> 09:04.767
How lifelike!

09:04.767 --> 09:06.067
(Mr. Butlertron)
Lifelike?

09:06.067 --> 09:08.967
I can hold complex
conversations with you

09:08.967 --> 09:11.333
in two distinct intonations.

09:11.333 --> 09:15.767
And if I hit Enter, Command,
F4, Turbo, Turbo, Select,

09:15.767 --> 09:17.467
and then clap twice,

09:17.467 --> 09:19.700
ECyboPooch will sit up
and bark!

Don't be fooled.

09:26.167 --> 09:27.867
That mangy mutt
is up to no good.

09:27.867 --> 09:32.533
Mr. B, I will not tolerate
your unfounded paranoia!

09:32.533 --> 09:36.100
ECyboPooch is part
of this family,

09:36.100 --> 09:39.167
and he deserves your e-respect.

09:39.167 --> 09:43.833
Well, I wish I was never born
into this stupid family.

me dinner tonight.

Oh, yeah.

I'd be seeing

09:57.200 --> 10:00.700
some naughty babe-on-chick
action right about now.

to shut up?

10:17.367 --> 10:18.500
I did.

- Shut up.

You're a girl,
right?

to remove a bra?

10:44.733 --> 10:46.467
[growls]

10:46.467 --> 10:48.167
I mean, do you step into it
like pants,

10:48.167 --> 10:50.400
or pull it over
like a shirt?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.333
Why don't you just
take the tissues out,

10:52.333 --> 10:53.333
and it'll fall off.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.500

You signed the nondisclosure
agreement.

I hope you have
good lawyers

hand-me-down pants off,

11:00.500 --> 11:02.467
Girls, girls, girls.

11:02.467 --> 11:04.067
You're both human beings.

11:04.067 --> 11:07.167
You both put your bras on
one leg at a time.

the cold pricklies

into warm fuzzies
that unite us...

By painting
our emotions.

11:20.567 --> 11:21.667
Huh?

11:21.667 --> 11:22.900
I'll get the smocks.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.867
And I know what I'm gonna paint:

11:24.867 --> 11:26.300

right down the middle
of the room.

if she--

Die, Dixie slut.

Fetch me a pie,

Why, thank you.

Great gravy!

17:48.667 --> 17:51.167
This is ECyboPooch
with damning evidence

17:51.167 --> 17:52.567
of Scudworth.

17:52.567 --> 17:57.233
I will now upload said evidence
via a 2,400 baud modem.

told me he was a spy.

Please!

My eight-inch Abe
wants to talk to you.

18:40.867 --> 18:42.967
He's in my pants.

18:42.967 --> 18:44.533
Come on,
everybody!

18:44.533 --> 18:46.200
Let's go out
behind this building,

18:46.200 --> 18:47.533
and I'll show him
to you.

Mm.

do your thing.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.833
Try the churros.

19:06.267 --> 19:07.667
The point is:

19:07.667 --> 19:08.967
I learned something today

19:08.967 --> 19:11.700
from a replica of the original
Abe Lincoln.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.400
And now it's time
for this replica

19:13.400 --> 19:16.167
of the original Abe Lincoln
to pass that message along.

19:16.167 --> 19:19.367
As my clone father
once so eloquently said...

19:19.367 --> 19:20.800
[clears throat]

19:20.800 --> 19:24.133
"Fervently we do prawn."

19:24.133 --> 19:25.133
Prawn?

19:25.133 --> 19:26.733
No, that can't be right.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.767
Something about a scourge.

19:28.767 --> 19:31.067
No, I don't even know how
to spell "scourge."

19:31.067 --> 19:33.300
No, but I guess this could
be "scourge."

19:33.300 --> 19:34.300
Yeah, no, it is "scourge."

19:34.300 --> 19:35.500
This is definitely "scourge."

It's raining.

(Toots)
But in the end,
the storm came,

20:01.467 --> 20:04.367
and it wiped away
all that bad feelings

20:04.367 --> 20:05.900
and also the pie.

20:05.900 --> 20:09.633
Eventually, the heavens
got all their crying out,

20:09.633 --> 20:11.767
and it was time
to be happy again.

20:11.767 --> 20:14.500
And like the north and south,

20:14.500 --> 20:16.867
Joan and Cleo realized
it was time to put an end

20:16.867 --> 20:19.033
to their overt hatred
for each other.

20:19.033 --> 20:22.800
And instead, have an understood,
unspoken hatred.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.000
And Principal Scudworth
and Mr. B,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
well, they learned--

Toots.

20:27.167 --> 20:28.300
[slurred]
Who are you talking to?

20:29.633 --> 20:32.100
Now, I'm a blind man.

20:32.100 --> 20:35.467
You telling me I've been talking
to myself the whole time?

20:35.467 --> 20:38.567
Well, if that ain't the most
embarrassing thing.
