00:01.929 --> 00:03.399
Previously on Angel:

00:05.530 --> 00:07.849
Angel's feelings are the
only ones I care about.

00:07.929 --> 00:10.179
I got dosed with demon DNA
for that man.

00:12.130 --> 00:14.449
Wesley's taking the baby away,
for good.

00:16.929 --> 00:19.179
- Daniel!
- It's the Quor-toth.

00:21.129 --> 00:22.210
Hi, Dad.

00:22.929 --> 00:24.190
- You're not alone.
- I know.

00:24.129 --> 00:26.089
- You stole my son.
- I kept your son alive.

00:26.530 --> 00:29.059
- What will he do?
- Angel will deal with Holtz.

00:30.129 --> 00:33.539
- I can't.
- You said you'd do anything for me.

00:56.530 --> 00:57.649
Hi.

00:58.329 --> 00:59.630
What you got there?

01:00.130 --> 01:03.850
I know you have grave concern for
Angel's welfare, so I made Mock-na.

01:04.328 --> 01:07.739
Oh, Mock-na. Which is...?

01:08.530 --> 01:10.700
A soothing brew to relieve tension.

01:12.129 --> 01:17.010
- Kind of looks like muddy water.
- Yes. The mud gives it body and flavor.

01:18.129 --> 01:19.989
There's no plock-weed
in this dimension...

01:19.930 --> 01:22.319
...so I made do with
creeping fig and sour grass.

01:22.930 --> 01:25.810
Though it is not true Mock-na,
it is very close.

01:26.530 --> 01:28.459
So it's mock Mock-na.

01:30.730 --> 01:31.849
Please.

01:40.930 --> 01:42.120
Well, that's....

01:43.930 --> 01:48.879
I can feel the tension draining. And a
little sediment going down the wrong--

01:51.730 --> 01:53.129
Tasty.

01:53.530 --> 01:57.989
Might I relieve you by gently and then
more rapidly rubbing your schlug-tee?

02:02.530 --> 02:03.859
I don't really....

02:06.129 --> 02:07.390
Maybe later, at home.

02:12.729 --> 02:16.629
I don't feel comfortable
doing it in the office, Groo.

02:17.530 --> 02:19.000
Doing it?

02:19.330 --> 02:21.219
- Sex.
- You wish to have sex?

02:21.729 --> 02:23.199
What? No! Sh!

02:24.129 --> 02:28.060
I was proposing a massage of your
schlug-tee, your tense neck muscle.

02:28.330 --> 02:30.860
But it is always an honor
to make sex with you.

02:33.729 --> 02:36.219
Later, at home.
I understand perfectly.

02:37.330 --> 02:38.770
Angel.

02:41.530 --> 02:43.419
Is not who I am, princess.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.789
I know. He's back.

02:49.930 --> 02:52.069
You didn't happen to hear?

02:52.330 --> 02:55.629
- Hear what?
- Good. So how did it go?

02:56.530 --> 02:58.530
- I found Holtz.
- And?

02:58.930 --> 03:00.300
I didn't kill him.

03:00.729 --> 03:03.569
Maybe you're growing as a person.
What did you do?

03:04.330 --> 03:06.719
- We talked.
- About Connor-- Steven.

03:07.330 --> 03:08.729
Yeah. Did he come home?

03:09.129 --> 03:12.430
No, he's still out with Gunn and Fred.
You said "home."

03:12.729 --> 03:15.919
It's a long story,
but Holtz wants what's best for him.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.629
And what's best for him
is living here with us?

03:19.930 --> 03:23.550
That's great! Oh, my God,
I'm so happy for you.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.469
Yes, it is a happy time.

03:37.930 --> 03:41.229
This didn't have to happen.
Your father was gonna leave.

03:41.530 --> 03:44.090
- He just wanted to talk to Angelus.
- Leave?

03:45.129 --> 03:48.610
Angelus won.
He could've just walked away.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.800
It's my fault.

03:57.729 --> 04:01.030
- He'll pay.
- I'll help you kill him.

04:03.129 --> 04:04.389
No.

04:06.129 --> 04:09.539
You don't want to kill him?
After what he did?

04:10.930 --> 04:12.860
What do you want to do?

05:11.449 --> 05:13.240
This one might work better.

05:13.250 --> 05:16.339
He'd have southern exposure.
Not too close to my room.

05:17.449 --> 05:19.699
I don't want him to
feel like I'm hovering.

05:19.850 --> 05:22.939
But not too far.
I want to keep an eye.

05:28.250 --> 05:29.439
What do you think?

05:30.050 --> 05:33.350
I think it's just as good as
the last five we looked at.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.949
It's not about the room,
it's about Connor--

05:37.850 --> 05:39.920
I can't get used to calling him Steven.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.279
Neither can I. It's what Holtz--

05:44.449 --> 05:46.620
It's what he wants to go by.

05:46.850 --> 05:48.850
Okay, Steven, Connor, whatever.

05:49.250 --> 05:52.689
It's about your son living here,
getting to know his father.

05:53.449 --> 05:55.199
I don't even own a TV.

05:57.050 --> 06:00.839
He'll want to watch TV. Not too much.
After homework and chores.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.459
He'll need clothes, weekly allowance.

06:04.250 --> 06:07.269
- What's good? 50 cents? A dollar?
- Yeah...

06:07.850 --> 06:12.060
- ...if you're Tom Sawyer painting a fence.
- See? I'm so out of touch.

06:12.649 --> 06:13.910
He's gonna hate me.

06:14.449 --> 06:18.800
No, he's not. He's gonna love you.

06:19.850 --> 06:21.149
How do you know?

06:21.649 --> 06:23.230
Because you're you.

06:24.649 --> 06:28.060
- Me. A vampire.
- You. A vampire.

06:28.850 --> 06:33.199
Who drinks blood, stays in shadows
and is older than all his friends combined.

06:34.250 --> 06:35.930
You're all those things, plus cheap.

06:36.649 --> 06:38.610
But none of that matters.

06:40.250 --> 06:41.370
Why not?

06:42.649 --> 06:48.019
Because you have the biggest and best
heart of anyone I have ever known.

06:49.850 --> 06:52.970
He's a smart kid. He'll figure it out.

06:54.050 --> 06:55.870
It's gonna be all right.

06:59.449 --> 07:01.379
- You're really--
- Aren't I?

07:03.050 --> 07:05.720
Feeling better, or do you
need to keep looking at rooms?

07:06.050 --> 07:07.209
Both.

07:07.250 --> 07:09.569
- He can have mine.
- What do you mean?

07:10.250 --> 07:12.639
Leaving.
On the midnight train to Georgia.

07:13.250 --> 07:17.850
Actually, it's the 9:18 p.m. flight to
Vegas, but where's the poetry in that?

07:19.250 --> 07:20.790
Is this because of Connor?

07:21.050 --> 07:22.870
- Steven.
- This is because of me.

07:23.449 --> 07:27.310
Buddy of mine's got a club,
and he needs a singer and a seer.

07:27.649 --> 07:31.300
- What about rebuilding your club here?
- That's a great idea.

07:32.449 --> 07:34.480
Except every time I do,
you all destroy it.

07:34.850 --> 07:37.199
It was only...three times.

07:39.649 --> 07:43.860
I got the big love here, and I'm
grateful, but it's time to move on.

07:45.050 --> 07:48.310
- But some of this is because--
- The not-so-little nipper?

07:49.250 --> 07:51.250
Not gonna lie. Kid's in the mix.

07:51.649 --> 07:53.050
Clearly not loving the demon-kind.

07:53.449 --> 07:56.360
I know it's his upbringing,
but I loved that baby.

07:57.649 --> 07:59.160
I just wouldn't....

08:00.649 --> 08:01.980
What?

08:01.850 --> 08:04.660
Turn my back on him anytime soon.

08:23.850 --> 08:25.009
No white cliffs?

08:26.250 --> 08:28.850
Not in this neck of the woods. Sorry.

08:29.850 --> 08:33.080
- Looks like where he came from, though.
- England?

08:34.649 --> 08:36.750
Maybe it's like the ranch.

08:37.649 --> 08:41.230
- The ranch?
- Where I was supposed to grow up.

08:41.850 --> 08:43.250
In Utah.

08:43.649 --> 08:45.399
He told you about that?

08:47.250 --> 08:50.730
- That was our dream.
- He always told it. Before sleep.

08:52.649 --> 08:56.159
Him and me,
where no one else could ever find us.

08:58.649 --> 08:59.769
Yeah.

09:01.049 --> 09:03.789
We should-- We need to bury him.

09:05.250 --> 09:06.509
No.

09:22.649 --> 09:23.950
I'll do it.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.789
No. He was bitten by the beast.

09:28.649 --> 09:30.370
He may rise again.

09:31.049 --> 09:33.149
You said you'd do anything for me.

09:38.250 --> 09:39.830
I will do as you taught me.

09:40.649 --> 09:45.639
I will cling to the good,
and I will lay waste to the evil.

09:55.049 --> 09:56.659
Sleep now, Father.

10:00.450 --> 10:01.710
And forgive me.

10:26.850 --> 10:28.039
Mind if I join you?

10:28.049 --> 10:30.889
On many levels
and with great intensity.

10:33.450 --> 10:36.289
How's your throat?
You want a lozenge?

10:37.049 --> 10:38.840
Life's something, huh?

10:39.450 --> 10:44.720
One day you're pivotal in the battle.
Next thing you know, you're on your own.

10:46.049 --> 10:51.419
No one even cares what you think
anymore. Well, I care.

10:52.649 --> 10:53.809
You care?

10:54.450 --> 10:57.049
As one human being to another.

10:58.649 --> 11:02.409
Just kidding. I care that your
great, big brain is going to waste.

11:02.850 --> 11:07.129
Correct me if I'm wrong, isn't Angel Jr.
without precedent in human history?

11:08.250 --> 11:09.370
You're wrong.

11:11.250 --> 11:15.080
Mesopotamian, Greek,
Hindi, Celtic myth, the Bible...

11:16.049 --> 11:20.470
...even Darwin, all support the coming of
something that wasn't possible before.

11:21.450 --> 11:24.820
Okay, the impossible is here.
But what does it mean?

11:25.049 --> 11:28.379
Is it the herald of a new age,
better things to come...

11:29.250 --> 11:32.759
...or the mass destruction
of everything we hold dear?

11:33.450 --> 11:34.570
Yes.

11:35.250 --> 11:39.820
Every child carries into the world the
possibility of salvation or slaughter.

11:40.649 --> 11:43.250
And one born to two vampires
carries it in spades.

11:43.649 --> 11:45.899
My people will root for slaughter.

11:46.049 --> 11:49.740
And your people--
Sorry, your former people...

11:50.850 --> 11:53.830
...they won't know what to do
if things turn sour.

11:55.049 --> 11:56.240
No.

11:56.850 --> 12:01.269
If the kid's the next Stalin, do you
kill him? You can't. He's Angel's son.

12:01.649 --> 12:05.230
On the other hand, if you just
watch while he kills Angel...

12:05.850 --> 12:09.850
...or somebody else,
that cute girl from Texas, say....

12:11.850 --> 12:16.169
Wow. Times like this,
glad I don't have a conscience.

12:18.450 --> 12:20.240
I think you should leave now.

12:22.649 --> 12:25.250
What was it like when she cut you?

12:27.450 --> 12:29.519
Are you terribly anxious to find out?

12:48.690 --> 12:50.409
- Nobody's here.
- Good.

12:51.090 --> 12:54.389
Bad. We gotta find Angel and tell him
we screwed up. I get your point.

12:55.289 --> 12:58.129
- Where is everybody?
- I am here.

13:00.690 --> 13:04.240
Cordelia and Angel are upstairs
trying out bedrooms.

13:06.090 --> 13:07.389
For Angel's son.

13:08.490 --> 13:10.519
I'm not telling a
16-year-old boy that.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.629
He's gotta know the facts of life.

13:13.889 --> 13:18.070
My record with the man-woman thing
isn't.... I don't wanna say "tragic farce."

13:18.690 --> 13:22.799
- Why not? You're still telling him.
- You could help. He'll have questions.

13:23.490 --> 13:25.700
Like, "What do you do
with a woman's schlug-tee?"

13:26.490 --> 13:30.669
You and your vampire hearing.
Next time you eavesdrop, I'm gonna....

13:33.690 --> 13:37.590
Easy there, sailor.
You use that kind of language at home?

13:45.090 --> 13:46.250
Where is he?

13:48.090 --> 13:49.389
- Uh....
- He ran away.

13:49.289 --> 13:51.570
He overheard us say
you were going to Holtz.

13:54.090 --> 13:58.269
- Then that's where he went.
- We were there. We didn't see them.

13:58.889 --> 14:01.629
All he'll find is an empty room.
He won't know what's happened.

14:02.490 --> 14:05.580
- What's happened?
- Holtz left. He wants Steven to live here.

14:06.090 --> 14:07.320
That's good!

14:07.889 --> 14:11.190
- As long as we tell him before--
- He is here.

14:12.090 --> 14:14.230
How can you tell him before he's--?

14:15.090 --> 14:16.320
Oh.

14:20.490 --> 14:23.649
Hey. You all right?

14:24.690 --> 14:25.850
I went to see my--

14:28.889 --> 14:30.220
He wasn't there.

14:31.289 --> 14:33.990
Yeah. I'm sorry. He's--

14:36.690 --> 14:38.159
He left, Steven.

14:40.889 --> 14:42.750
He gave me this letter for you.

15:00.090 --> 15:02.509
He says my place is here now.

15:03.690 --> 15:04.879
With you.

15:06.690 --> 15:12.100
It wouldn't have to be forever.
Maybe just give it a try for a while.

15:17.490 --> 15:18.960
Okay.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.740
We'll give it a try.

15:46.649 --> 15:47.879
It's me.

15:48.450 --> 15:49.639
Can I come in?

15:52.649 --> 15:56.899
Brought you a bookcase and some of my
favorite books when I was your age.

16:01.049 --> 16:03.539
Want to get some breakfast?
Are you hungry?

16:05.250 --> 16:06.480
Not really.

16:09.450 --> 16:10.820
We can go out.

16:13.649 --> 16:15.899
I'd have to wear a burka or something.

16:16.049 --> 16:20.899
Hey, we'll stay in, hang out together.
Tonight, we'll do something special.

16:22.049 --> 16:23.519
You ever been to a movie?

16:25.049 --> 16:26.210
No.

16:26.850 --> 16:29.340
We'll go to an action movie.
You'll love it.

16:31.049 --> 16:34.529
Anything else you want to see or do,
just say the word.

16:41.850 --> 16:43.669
There is one thing.

16:44.850 --> 16:46.360
What?

16:50.250 --> 16:52.350
I want to know how you do that.

16:52.649 --> 16:53.879
Fight?

16:55.049 --> 16:56.169
Yes.

16:56.850 --> 17:00.570
- You got that down pretty good already.
- I want to learn...

17:03.450 --> 17:04.710
...to be like you.

17:06.450 --> 17:10.029
Well, there might be a thing or two
that I could show you.

17:10.650 --> 17:11.980
Stake! Vampire!

17:13.049 --> 17:14.700
Behind you. Civilian!

17:14.848 --> 17:16.319
Protect her. Protect her!

17:19.650 --> 17:21.230
Where's your balance, huh?

17:22.049 --> 17:23.420
You lose it...

17:23.848 --> 17:26.059
...you lose. Don't worry, I got you.

17:28.650 --> 17:32.549
- You're doing good, kid. You got heart.
- I want to be the vampire.

17:33.450 --> 17:35.940
- I wanna be in a hot tub.
- Who's gonna clean this stuff up?

17:37.049 --> 17:38.660
Yeah, it's been a long day.

17:40.049 --> 17:42.190
- Had enough?
- No. I want to learn.

17:43.650 --> 17:47.089
Is this kid a chip off
the old block or what, huh?

17:47.849 --> 17:49.359
- He's chippy.
- Hey, Cor...

17:49.650 --> 17:51.970
- ...do you wanna go to the movies?
- Yeah!

17:52.650 --> 17:56.230
I mean, I'd like to. I can't.
Groo and I are supposed to...

17:56.849 --> 17:58.809
...have some one-on-one time, so....

17:59.250 --> 18:02.059
Right. You should do that.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.369
Okay. Vampire.

18:07.650 --> 18:10.000
You're a vampire, you're not in Cats,

18:13.049 --> 18:15.259
- Innocent bystander.
- By-sitter.

18:17.250 --> 18:18.829
Close your eyes. Feel it.

18:19.049 --> 18:20.940
Where's the attack gonna come from?

18:21.450 --> 18:22.819
Good. Good!

18:24.009 --> 18:25.200
Hi, honey.

18:25.809 --> 18:30.230
It's me. And I got your favorites:
tuna and ice cream.

18:31.210 --> 18:34.440
How about tonight you
try not mixing it together?

18:36.609 --> 18:40.369
There you are. Wow, you look nice.

18:46.809 --> 18:47.930
What's wrong?

18:48.009 --> 18:49.240
I am.

18:50.410 --> 18:52.369
Wrong. For you.

18:52.809 --> 18:53.970
What?

18:54.609 --> 18:57.869
I am not the one you love. He is.

18:58.809 --> 19:01.019
He is? Who "he"?

19:03.009 --> 19:03.880
Yo.

19:04.210 --> 19:08.250
- Hey, Lorne. Come on in.
- Well, you're in a good mood.

19:09.009 --> 19:11.539
Yeah. Taking the kid to the movies.
He's gonna love it.

19:12.009 --> 19:14.710
No subtitles or dreary leitmotif,
all bloody action?

19:15.609 --> 19:17.890
- You bet.
- He'll love you for it.

19:18.609 --> 19:22.509
I thought I'd stop by
and say arrivederci, Angel-hair.

19:22.809 --> 19:25.130
- You're really going.
- I'm really going.

19:25.809 --> 19:27.140
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

19:27.609 --> 19:30.420
Here. I got you something
to remember me by.

19:31.210 --> 19:33.740
"Songs for the Love. Lorne."

19:35.410 --> 19:36.670
I get it.

19:36.609 --> 19:40.119
- "Lovelorn" because your name's Lorne.
- My publicist's idea.

19:40.809 --> 19:45.269
Her name's mud now, but the tunes are
good. And that's not my real gift.

19:46.210 --> 19:48.420
This is. It's mutual.

19:50.410 --> 19:53.819
The way you feel about Cordelia is
how she feels about you.

19:54.609 --> 19:58.089
I love Angel?
What are you talking about? I love...

20:00.009 --> 20:02.470
...you know, us.

20:04.210 --> 20:06.029
You two are so obviously connected.

20:06.009 --> 20:07.869
- You finish each other's...
- ...sentences, you laugh at the same...

20:08.410 --> 20:10.480
...jests.

20:11.410 --> 20:13.829
When he grieves, when he is hurting....

20:14.410 --> 20:16.059
Her heart breaks for you.

20:16.210 --> 20:18.950
In my heart I've known the truth
for some time.

20:20.410 --> 20:26.029
I have just been struggling to find
the courage to do what is right.

20:27.009 --> 20:31.720
Bubelah, stay open. Connor's back,
your whole life's coming together.

20:33.009 --> 20:35.640
Sometimes things do work out.

20:36.009 --> 20:37.450
I gotta skidoo.

20:39.009 --> 20:41.779
Take good care of yourself.
And keep in touch.

20:42.609 --> 20:46.470
I'll drop you a line. Let you
know where to send the gift basket.

20:47.410 --> 20:49.940
I don't know what to say, Groo.

20:51.009 --> 20:52.480
Tell me I am wrong.

20:54.609 --> 20:56.190
That I should stay.

20:57.609 --> 20:59.289
That you love only me.

21:49.890 --> 21:51.119
Pretty cool, huh?

21:57.690 --> 21:59.789
You emptied the jumbo tub?

22:00.690 --> 22:01.920
Free refills.

22:02.490 --> 22:03.789
- I love this woman.
- Sh!

22:06.690 --> 22:08.480
Don't skimp on the butter.

22:12.690 --> 22:14.789
It's all right. It's make-believe.

22:21.089 --> 22:22.700
How'd they do that?

22:33.690 --> 22:35.130
Go, go, go!

22:44.490 --> 22:45.650
Get down!

22:46.289 --> 22:47.940
Out!

22:55.890 --> 23:00.309
Tie me up, threaten me with sharp
objects, but don't let me go.

23:01.289 --> 23:02.799
Chowder-head.

23:04.890 --> 23:06.119
Kid's pretty good.

23:06.690 --> 23:10.829
I can't wait to get my hands on him,
cut him open, see what makes him tick.

23:13.289 --> 23:14.970
- Get back!
- No,

23:16.289 --> 23:18.990
- He wants to protect his son.
- We were counting on that.

23:19.890 --> 23:21.640
What weren't you counting on?

23:22.890 --> 23:25.140
- Get off!
- The kid wanting to protect him.

23:31.890 --> 23:33.470
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

23:37.289 --> 23:39.150
Abort! Abort!

23:39.690 --> 23:41.789
Abort! Abort!

23:49.890 --> 23:51.190
Drive! Drive!

23:56.490 --> 23:57.650
Okay. Easy.

23:57.690 --> 23:59.579
- Now we're even.
- Now you're dead.

24:00.089 --> 24:03.809
What, you're gonna kill a human in
front of your son? Set an example?

24:04.890 --> 24:06.150
I vote yes.

24:07.289 --> 24:08.829
You're not human.

24:10.289 --> 24:11.829
We should probably both--

24:12.690 --> 24:14.230
Stay away from my father.

24:19.890 --> 24:21.890
I'm not your enemy.

24:22.289 --> 24:23.829
We can help you, Steven.

24:25.890 --> 24:27.259
My name is Connor.

24:37.890 --> 24:39.500
Let's go home.

24:45.730 --> 24:47.059
I don't feel....

24:48.730 --> 24:51.329
And even if I did, it's impossible.

24:51.730 --> 24:55.730
- It's ridiculous.
- That's right, it's-- Whoa.

24:57.130 --> 25:00.150
Maybe on some level
I've always known it's true.

25:00.730 --> 25:02.549
I have? It is?

25:03.130 --> 25:07.980
- I'm in love.
- I am? I am. With Angel, right?

25:08.529 --> 25:10.670
- With Angel.
- Just checking.

25:12.130 --> 25:15.319
I'm scared. But I know it's right.

25:16.329 --> 25:19.380
I know somehow
it's all gonna be all right.

25:19.930 --> 25:21.089
It is?

25:21.730 --> 25:22.849
Really?

25:25.930 --> 25:27.299
Thanks for the tip.

25:29.529 --> 25:30.859
I got it!

25:31.329 --> 25:33.609
He's whistling.
Never heard him whistle.

25:34.329 --> 25:35.490
He's happy.

25:36.730 --> 25:39.609
- Angel Investigations. We can help you.
- Hi,

25:40.329 --> 25:42.890
- It's me.
- Hi, Cor.

25:43.329 --> 25:45.789
- How are you?
- I'm good. You?

25:48.730 --> 25:51.079
- I'm pretty good.
- Angel...

25:51.730 --> 25:54.190
...I need to talk to you in person.

25:54.730 --> 25:56.170
Is it something bad?

25:56.529 --> 26:02.150
No. No, it's something good, I think.
It sort of depends on how you feel.

26:04.329 --> 26:07.279
- About what?
- Well, about me.

26:09.130 --> 26:10.670
Oh.

26:12.130 --> 26:13.710
Could you meet me tonight?

26:13.930 --> 26:16.069
Tonight? Sure. Okay. Where?

26:16.329 --> 26:21.210
I love Point Dume, There's a viewpoint,
it's the first turn north of Kanan,

26:22.329 --> 26:25.349
- Really pretty spot.
- Point Dume, viewpoint,

26:25.930 --> 26:29.859
First turn north of Kanan.
We'll meet there.

26:31.329 --> 26:32.630
- About an hour?
- Yes.

26:33.130 --> 26:34.569
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:35.529 --> 26:38.859
- Yes.
- Good, Okay, then, we'll do that,

26:45.730 --> 26:46.890
Oh, God, oh, God.

26:52.329 --> 26:55.420
- I have to go out for a while, son.
- With Cordelia?

26:56.529 --> 26:58.740
Yeah. You gonna be all right?

26:59.529 --> 27:00.789
She's beautiful.

27:02.529 --> 27:04.740
And she cares about you. I like her.

27:06.730 --> 27:07.960
I'm glad.

27:09.130 --> 27:11.339
It's good to see you happy, Dad.

27:15.730 --> 27:19.349
- Now he's humming.
- He's really happy.

27:22.930 --> 27:25.180
- But not perfectly happy, I hope.
- No.

27:25.930 --> 27:27.400
Just checking.

27:33.250 --> 27:37.109
You know that sinking feeling you
sometimes get the morning after?

27:40.450 --> 27:42.059
It arrived early.

27:42.849 --> 27:46.609
It's like a little death.
Several, in fact.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.410
Get out.

27:50.650 --> 27:54.930
What, no sweet kiss?
No "When can I see you again?"

27:56.650 --> 28:00.480
Watch the dirty looks. That's what
got me going in the first place.

28:02.049 --> 28:03.349
I'll give you this:

28:03.849 --> 28:07.430
You sure know how to channel
your rage, frustration and hate.

28:08.049 --> 28:10.009
Always a bigger turn-on than love.

28:10.450 --> 28:11.569
You still here?

28:15.250 --> 28:19.359
I'm starting to like you. But don't go
making more of this than it is.

28:20.049 --> 28:23.529
I'm not one of the doe-eyed girls
of Angel Investigations.

28:24.250 --> 28:26.640
Don't be thinking about me
when I'm gone.

28:27.250 --> 28:30.019
I wasn't thinking about you
when you were here.

28:35.650 --> 28:40.740
So your former boss has a soul,
and you're losing yours.

28:43.450 --> 28:46.430
Well, you're just new all over,
aren't you?

29:20.609 --> 29:24.259
Slowpoke! I'm late, I'm late.
And it's not a date.

29:54.809 --> 29:56.250
I hate those things.

29:57.809 --> 30:00.480
We're just gonna talk
like two grown-up adults.

30:00.809 --> 30:04.670
I have some feelings.
He may have some feelings.

30:05.609 --> 30:09.299
He may not even know I'm
insane until he hears my feelings.

30:13.410 --> 30:16.460
Oh, no. No, no, no! Not now!

30:52.410 --> 30:53.529
Oh, sh--

31:10.410 --> 31:11.529
Connor.

31:15.210 --> 31:16.369
Dad.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.339
What are you doing here?

31:18.809 --> 31:22.319
We're family, and I wanted to show you
how I feel about that.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.000
Connor.

31:38.009 --> 31:42.359
It's all about balance. You lose it...
You lose.

32:02.569 --> 32:03.730
Don't be...

32:06.170 --> 32:07.359
...frightened.

32:07.970 --> 32:11.589
- It's a little late for that.
- Sorry. You remember me? I'm--

32:12.170 --> 32:16.140
Yeah. Skip. You tend to
remember your demon guides.

32:17.569 --> 32:18.970
What is going on?

32:19.970 --> 32:21.299
I think you know.

32:22.970 --> 32:24.230
I'm dying.

32:24.769 --> 32:26.700
No, no. You're not dying.

32:27.170 --> 32:28.569
- Not dying?
- No.

32:28.970 --> 32:30.690
- Say that part first.
- Sorry.

32:31.369 --> 32:36.009
It's not the end, it's the beginning.
You're a great warrior, Cordelia.

32:36.769 --> 32:40.599
The battle we're all a part of is fought on
many different planes and dimensions.

32:42.170 --> 32:43.819
You've outgrown this one.

32:44.569 --> 32:46.849
You've become a higher being.

32:47.569 --> 32:49.529
- Me?
- You.

32:49.970 --> 32:53.690
You took on the visions at the cost
of a happy, normal life...

32:54.769 --> 32:57.680
...and even when they were killing you,
you wouldn't let them go.

32:58.369 --> 33:02.940
The big test was The Powers making you
part demon. They bet the farm on you.

33:03.769 --> 33:06.750
Power corrupts,
and they gave you a lot of power.

33:07.369 --> 33:08.559
The glow-y thing.

33:09.170 --> 33:12.289
Which you used well,
to fight evil and heal Connor....

33:13.369 --> 33:16.420
And only that one time as a
night-light. Bad dreams.

33:18.170 --> 33:20.910
Skip, I don't understand.

33:21.769 --> 33:22.960
I think you do.

33:25.970 --> 33:27.299
It's ridiculous.

33:27.769 --> 33:30.470
I'm just a somewhat normal girl...

33:30.769 --> 33:36.000
...who has visions, glows and sometimes
blows things up with her new power.

33:38.569 --> 33:41.240
- I'm a higher being.
- Yes.

33:42.170 --> 33:46.240
And when you say I've "outgrown this
level," it sort of implies--

33:46.970 --> 33:48.480
You're moving on to a new one.

33:49.369 --> 33:51.509
- Now I'm really scared.
- I know.

33:51.769 --> 33:54.609
- I also know you're ready.
- Oh, no, I'm not.

33:55.970 --> 33:57.720
The universe begs to differ.

33:58.369 --> 34:01.529
- And deep down inside, I think--
- Yes.

34:01.970 --> 34:04.500
All right? Stop saying I know.

34:05.569 --> 34:06.869
Maybe I do know.

34:07.970 --> 34:12.500
Maybe, if given enough time, I might
even get used to the idea. But...

34:17.570 --> 34:19.989
...I don't have enough time, do I?

34:23.090 --> 34:27.130
Easy. Talk to me. Talk to me.

34:27.889 --> 34:29.820
- Okay?
- Okay.

34:48.289 --> 34:50.889
I don't know what's wrong with you,
but you're gonna talk!

35:15.889 --> 35:17.010
No.

35:17.690 --> 35:19.059
Of course not.

35:19.489 --> 35:23.769
Why would The Powers give me time for
the most important talk of my life?

35:24.289 --> 35:26.219
I'm on my way to--

35:26.690 --> 35:29.530
I'm in love, with Angel.

35:30.889 --> 35:34.010
What you're being called to do
transcends love.

35:34.489 --> 35:40.070
How is that fair? I can't leave
without telling him. I won't.

35:44.090 --> 35:46.440
He has to know how I feel.

35:47.090 --> 35:48.840
Why does this have to be now?

35:49.489 --> 35:52.159
There's work to be done
in the higher realms.

35:56.090 --> 35:58.480
Can you at least tell Angel for me?

35:59.690 --> 36:01.550
Sorry. Not allowed.

36:02.090 --> 36:03.489
Then I'm not going.

36:06.889 --> 36:09.559
How could they possibly
do this to me now?

36:17.690 --> 36:20.389
This is the last test, isn't it?

36:40.409 --> 36:41.639
Connor...

36:43.409 --> 36:44.949
...why are you doing this?

36:45.210 --> 36:46.650
You murdered my father.

36:47.610 --> 36:50.909
No, I didn't. I swear.

36:53.010 --> 36:54.199
He's lying.

36:54.809 --> 36:57.090
I'm not lying. She knows it.

36:57.809 --> 36:59.460
You're the prince of lies.

37:00.809 --> 37:04.780
That's why you wouldn't let them kill me
at the drive-in. So you could.

37:05.610 --> 37:07.289
Killing is too good for you.

37:08.010 --> 37:10.679
You don't get to die. You get to live.

37:12.809 --> 37:14.389
Forever.

37:20.010 --> 37:21.170
Cordelia?

37:26.610 --> 37:31.769
I ever encounter those Powers That Be,
we're gonna have a talk. A big talk.

37:33.809 --> 37:35.769
You're doing the right thing.

37:36.809 --> 37:37.929
I'm scared.

37:41.010 --> 37:42.690
But I know it's right.

37:44.010 --> 37:47.199
I know somehow
it's all gonna be all right.

37:51.210 --> 37:52.369
What do I do?

37:54.809 --> 37:56.000
Just say yes.

37:59.010 --> 38:00.340
I already have.

38:24.809 --> 38:28.780
Some day you'll learn the truth,
and you'll hate yourself.

38:30.210 --> 38:32.309
Don't. It's not your fault.

38:35.010 --> 38:36.409
- I don't blame you.
- Liar!

38:36.809 --> 38:38.909
Listen to me. I love you.

38:39.210 --> 38:41.099
Never forget that.

38:41.610 --> 38:42.769
Connor!

38:43.409 --> 38:47.030
Connor, never forget that I'm your
father and that I love you.

38:47.610 --> 38:49.400
Connor! Connor!

40:30.210 --> 40:33.329
Connor didn't want to come for
a midnight snack?

40:34.409 --> 40:37.079
It's okay.
I'll scrounge something up here.

40:37.409 --> 40:39.760
He's not in his room.
You didn't see him?

40:40.409 --> 40:43.639
No. He's gone? Again?

40:45.210 --> 40:49.420
Did you ask Lorne if--? No, because
Lorne doesn't live here anymore.

40:50.010 --> 40:51.730
Not used to that yet.

40:52.409 --> 40:54.230
I'm sure Connor'll--

40:55.409 --> 40:59.239
I'm sure it's nothing, but we should
tell Cordelia or Angel.

40:59.610 --> 41:01.889
I've been trying. No one's answering.

41:02.610 --> 41:04.710
I don't like the sound of that.

41:08.010 --> 41:09.659
Where'd everybody go?

41:10.305 --> 41:16.506
