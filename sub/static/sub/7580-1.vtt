WEBVTT

00:46.709 --> 00:49.250
In love, one and one...

00:49.291 --> 00:51.250
are...

00:51.291 --> 00:52.792
one.

00:54.458 --> 01:00.333
Seldom do we get the opportunity

00:54.458 --> 01:00.333
to witness the art in love.

01:02.291 --> 01:05.291
But that is what we

01:02.291 --> 01:05.291
all really desire.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.667
Not just to be loved,

01:06.709 --> 01:10.166
but to be loved

01:06.709 --> 01:10.166
in that all-encompassing,

01:10.208 --> 01:12.458
Heathcliffe-on-the-moors,

01:10.208 --> 01:12.458
one-true-love,

01:12.500 --> 01:14.250
soulmate kind of way.

01:33.333 --> 01:37.834
And yet, rarely are we prepared

01:33.333 --> 01:37.834
for it when it happens by.

01:39.709 --> 01:44.917
Perhaps you've been trying to

01:39.709 --> 01:44.917
inject meaning into your life...

01:44.959 --> 01:49.625
endlessly seeking that spiritual

01:44.959 --> 01:49.625
connection in other ways.

02:00.166 --> 02:01.333
There's no way I'm going.

02:01.375 --> 02:02.917
That's no way

02:01.375 --> 02:02.917
to behave, young man.

02:02.959 --> 02:05.917
Nash, you did hear that

02:02.959 --> 02:05.917
they're protesting downtown?

02:05.959 --> 02:07.375
The nerve of those people.

02:07.417 --> 02:09.375
Nerve is right.

02:07.417 --> 02:09.375
It's all a lot of noise.

02:09.417 --> 02:11.500
Noise and nonsense...

02:09.417 --> 02:11.500
but we'll be there.

02:11.542 --> 02:13.583
All of us, Pastor Barry.

02:11.542 --> 02:13.583
Don't you worry.

02:13.625 --> 02:15.750
That's the kind of support

02:13.625 --> 02:15.750
we're looking for, right?

02:16.542 --> 02:20.375
Or maybe you're one of those

02:16.542 --> 02:20.375
rare and fortunate few

02:20.417 --> 02:23.750
who find true love

02:20.417 --> 02:23.750
very early in life.

02:35.583 --> 02:40.208
For others, life might be

02:35.583 --> 02:40.208
at its most grim.

02:42.583 --> 02:44.959
This way, Peyton...

02:45.000 --> 02:49.875
you can arrange your life

02:45.000 --> 02:49.875
exactly as you want it...

02:49.917 --> 02:52.834
And precisely as you like.

02:56.667 --> 02:59.583
You did an amazing

02:56.667 --> 02:59.583
job today, Lombard.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.041
Thank you.

03:05.500 --> 03:09.834
And as funerals go,

03:05.500 --> 03:09.834
not too shabby.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.000
Yeah.

03:11.041 --> 03:13.291
I think Mom even

03:11.041 --> 03:13.291
would have approved.

03:14.083 --> 03:15.375
You know, if we had

03:14.083 --> 03:15.375
a few more years,

03:15.417 --> 03:17.041
we could have

03:15.417 --> 03:17.041
made her a Democrat.

03:19.834 --> 03:20.750
Maybe not.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.625
It's really pretty, isn't it?

03:36.458 --> 03:38.417
I need to go for a swim.

03:38.917 --> 03:40.709
Well, do it.

03:41.458 --> 03:43.417
And if soulmates exist,

03:43.458 --> 03:46.291
how can we be sure that

03:43.458 --> 03:46.291
that person we meet

03:46.333 --> 03:48.834
or the person that we're

03:46.333 --> 03:48.834
sharing our life with

03:48.875 --> 03:51.125
is the one?

03:51.166 --> 03:55.709
Here are a few stories that may

03:51.166 --> 03:55.709
shed some light on the subject.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.458
I'll let you be the judge.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.667
Our families...

04:08.709 --> 04:12.500
they kept us

04:08.709 --> 04:12.500
apart for ten years.

04:14.709 --> 04:16.250
We lost track.

04:18.583 --> 04:23.250
Then, one day,

04:18.583 --> 04:23.250
I was in the airport,

04:23.291 --> 04:25.250
on my way

04:23.291 --> 04:25.250
to London for school.

04:27.458 --> 04:30.500
I saw the back

04:27.458 --> 04:30.500
of Rasheed's head,

04:30.542 --> 04:32.709
from across an entire airport.

04:32.750 --> 04:37.166
I knew it was him.

04:37.208 --> 04:40.375
I turned as if I had

04:37.208 --> 04:40.375
no control over my body.

04:40.417 --> 04:42.959
I turned, and I saw him.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.166
I saw him, this man -

04:45.208 --> 04:48.625
this beautiful man,

04:45.208 --> 04:48.625
who I love.

04:49.875 --> 04:52.083
This man that I love.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.792
That is what I'm talking about.

04:53.834 --> 04:55.417
That's what

04:53.834 --> 04:55.417
I'm talking about!

04:55.458 --> 04:57.000
The twin flame.

04:57.041 --> 04:58.792
The ultimate love connection.

05:18.750 --> 05:22.542
You know, I heard that someone

05:18.750 --> 05:22.542
might be ovulating this morning.

05:22.583 --> 05:23.667
Mmm, hmm.

05:23.709 --> 05:25.458
It wouldn't happen

05:23.709 --> 05:25.458
to be you, would it?

05:25.500 --> 05:27.125
It would.

05:27.834 --> 05:29.500
Then I'll be right back.

05:29.542 --> 05:30.667
OK.

06:08.208 --> 06:09.333
I love you.

06:09.375 --> 06:10.417
I know.

06:25.709 --> 06:28.667
There are no

06:25.709 --> 06:28.667
guarantees in life, Peyton.

06:28.709 --> 06:30.458
Be prepared for anything.

06:45.625 --> 06:48.750
So, what time will you meet us?

06:48.792 --> 06:50.792
Uh...not sure.

06:52.667 --> 06:54.125
Don't tell me you're not coming.

06:54.166 --> 06:56.458
Millie, I really

06:54.166 --> 06:56.458
have a lot to do.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.625
I'm very busy.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.458
Oh, it's very clear

06:57.667 --> 06:59.458
God's got your back.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.625
You're running

06:59.500 --> 07:01.625
everything here so smoothly.

07:01.667 --> 07:04.458
But you have to

07:01.667 --> 07:04.458
commit to your faith...

07:04.500 --> 07:06.417
and put it to real work.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.291
Well, you know I teach

07:06.458 --> 07:08.291
the kinder program

07:08.333 --> 07:10.583
on Saturday mornings,

07:08.333 --> 07:10.583
but I really just don't think

07:10.625 --> 07:12.625
that your interpretations--

07:12.667 --> 07:14.625
Please. Interpretations?

07:14.667 --> 07:16.709
That's the oldest

07:14.667 --> 07:16.709
trick in the book.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.417
But given that the

07:16.750 --> 07:18.417
Bible was written in--

07:18.458 --> 07:20.917
They are tearing us apart

07:18.458 --> 07:20.917
with all their marriage talk

07:20.959 --> 07:24.000
and liberal judges ruling

07:20.959 --> 07:24.000
willy nilly in their favor.

07:24.041 --> 07:27.041
We are not going to stand by

07:24.041 --> 07:27.041
and allow it, Mrs. Winters.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.709
Shame on you.

07:30.709 --> 07:33.083
Shame on you for

07:30.709 --> 07:33.083
undermining your husband's work.

07:33.125 --> 07:35.834
But more importantly -

07:33.125 --> 07:35.834
God's work.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.083
Elena...

07:48.208 --> 07:51.709
I'm sorry, but she just...

07:48.208 --> 07:51.709
she's been really tired.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.291
It's OK.

07:53.333 --> 07:54.959
I've already forgiven her.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.667
I knew you would.

07:57.250 --> 07:58.250
So excuse me.

07:58.291 --> 07:59.250
Oh, sure.

08:40.875 --> 08:42.375
I drink tea, Peyton,

- Yeah.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.166
I know how much you want this.

09:16.667 --> 09:19.000
But maybe we're trying to hard.

pray to God

(Tyler)

10:19.375 --> 10:21.000
Now then...

10:21.041 --> 10:23.375
For those of your debating

10:21.041 --> 10:23.375
the soulemetry qualities

10:23.417 --> 10:25.083
of that special someone,

10:25.125 --> 10:27.208
let us look at a few

10:25.125 --> 10:27.208
of the criteria

10:27.250 --> 10:29.000
that are absolutely necessary

10:29.041 --> 10:32.208
if this person is indeed

10:29.041 --> 10:32.208
your twin flame.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.667
First of all,

10:33.709 --> 10:37.834
this person may come

10:33.709 --> 10:37.834
in an unusual package.

10:37.875 --> 10:39.458
Not your typical type.

10:40.208 --> 10:42.458
I was a nun for years,

10:42.500 --> 10:46.000
and I was working at the

10:42.500 --> 10:46.000
food bank when she came in,

10:46.041 --> 10:48.500
looking like the

10:46.041 --> 10:48.500
bad side of awful.

10:49.875 --> 10:51.750
And so I got her

10:49.875 --> 10:51.750
into treatment

10:51.792 --> 10:53.834
and found her a welding job,

10:53.875 --> 10:55.709
you know, got her

10:53.875 --> 10:55.709
back on her feet.

10:55.750 --> 10:58.208
And somewhere

10:55.750 --> 10:58.208
during all of that,

10:58.250 --> 11:01.375
I fell deeply in love with her.

11:03.125 --> 11:06.750
But it was, it was against

11:03.125 --> 11:06.750
everything that I believed in.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.083
So I prayed and

11:06.792 --> 11:09.083
went into seclusion,

11:09.125 --> 11:13.583
but nothing, nothing

11:09.125 --> 11:13.583
that I did could, um,

11:13.625 --> 11:15.542
keep her from my mind.

11:16.875 --> 11:20.125
And, um, then one morning,

11:20.166 --> 11:21.750
I woke up in the hospital.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.458
God, I was scared.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.375
You were pale.

11:27.417 --> 11:30.000
Apparently, I had passed out

11:27.417 --> 11:30.000
from dehydration,

11:30.041 --> 11:31.917
and when I came to,

11:31.959 --> 11:37.041
there was Jackie...

11:31.959 --> 11:37.041
sitting there like an angel.

11:37.959 --> 11:40.125
I thought I'd never

11:37.959 --> 11:40.125
see her again.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.500
When I did...

11:47.375 --> 11:50.083
And I knew from that moment,

11:50.125 --> 11:54.583
even though my entire life

11:50.125 --> 11:54.583
had been devoted to the church

11:54.625 --> 11:57.083
and Catholic scripture,

11:57.125 --> 12:01.125
I knew that my God

11:57.125 --> 12:01.125
loved Jackie...

12:02.250 --> 12:04.750
And loved me loving her.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.208
You're gonna love this one.

12:07.250 --> 12:08.917
It's called

12:07.250 --> 12:08.917
"Soulemetry By The Stars."

12:08.959 --> 12:11.458
My beautiful wife Lily

12:08.959 --> 12:11.458
arranged the whole thing.

12:11.500 --> 12:12.500
See ya' there.

12:12.959 --> 12:14.500
Ah! As if on-cue.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.375
Hey, baby.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.291
I'm about to go snap up

12:21.000 --> 12:23.291
that internet company

12:23.333 --> 12:26.125
that's been cut off

12:23.333 --> 12:26.125
at its knees.

12:26.166 --> 12:27.500
Ah!

12:27.542 --> 12:29.834
If they only knew what

12:27.542 --> 12:29.834
a pussy cat you really are.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.917
I mean, seriously.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.917
Do I look like I belong with

12:31.959 --> 12:34.917
this jet-setting businesswoman?

12:34.959 --> 12:37.166
Or any woman for that matter?

12:37.208 --> 12:40.291
All my life,

12:37.208 --> 12:40.291
everybody thought I was gay.

12:40.333 --> 12:42.041
Was it my sensitivity?

12:42.083 --> 12:45.000
My extensive collection of

12:42.083 --> 12:45.000
Barbara Streisand memorabilia?

12:45.041 --> 12:46.458
Who can say.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.583
When it comes to Lily,

12:46.500 --> 12:48.583
it's the real deal.

12:48.625 --> 12:49.500
He's all yours.

12:49.542 --> 12:51.458
You are going to

12:49.542 --> 12:51.458
love this story!

12:52.875 --> 12:54.792
Or not.

12:54.834 --> 12:56.500
Let's get you a drink.

12:57.542 --> 12:59.792
You're not doing anything wrong.

12:57.542 --> 12:59.792
Stop that!

13:01.959 --> 13:03.917
Maybe it's a sign.

13:03.959 --> 13:05.500
Well, that's why we're adopting.

13:06.125 --> 13:08.917
Listen, my exquisite angel...

13:08.959 --> 13:11.750
I know you better than anybody.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.000
My God, between your

13:11.792 --> 13:14.000
archaic parents

13:14.041 --> 13:16.750
and Barry's crusades du jour,

13:16.792 --> 13:19.166
it's a testament

13:16.792 --> 13:19.166
to your strength...

13:19.208 --> 13:20.917
Or complete insanity.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.875
Tell me something.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.917
What's in this for you?

13:28.041 --> 13:30.792
Come on, give me your hands.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.792
Give me your hands.

13:32.041 --> 13:34.083
If I've told you once,

13:32.041 --> 13:34.083
I've told you a thousand times,

13:34.125 --> 13:35.667
he is not your twin flame.

13:35.709 --> 13:36.542
Alright?

13:36.583 --> 13:38.333
This silly little congregation.

13:39.417 --> 13:41.000
Oh...

13:42.125 --> 13:43.959
Interesting.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.166
What?

13:47.917 --> 13:53.750
I'm getting that you

13:47.917 --> 13:53.750
should pursue the adoption.

13:55.542 --> 13:59.041
Someone is definitely

13:55.542 --> 13:59.041
coming into your life...

13:59.083 --> 14:01.959
- In a big way.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.959
- Yes. A baby.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.166
- That's not what I'm seeing.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.166
- Please...

14:04.208 --> 14:07.041
I love that you do all of this.

14:07.083 --> 14:08.750
You know I do.

14:08.792 --> 14:11.375
I just, I'm not sure

14:08.792 --> 14:11.375
that I believe what--

14:11.417 --> 14:13.959
Sweetheart, there is no

14:11.417 --> 14:13.959
denying what I'm seeing here.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.625
Your destiny is gonna happen

14:14.000 --> 14:17.625
whether you like it or not.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.000
- I know what I'm talking about.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.000
- I know you do.

14:23.291 --> 14:27.458
Secondly, they meet.

14:23.291 --> 14:27.458
Randomly.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.709
Possibly, the only place

14:27.500 --> 14:30.709
their worlds could intersect.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.250
Sorry, I just had

14:31.000 --> 14:33.250
a quick question.

14:33.291 --> 14:35.959
I can't help but notice that I'm

14:33.291 --> 14:35.959
the only single person here,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.959
and I, I just wanted

14:36.000 --> 14:38.959
to know, um, I mean,

14:39.000 --> 14:40.417
I have a job as a writer,

14:40.458 --> 14:43.458
I just, I didn't know if

14:40.458 --> 14:43.458
there was a longer process--

14:43.500 --> 14:46.792
No, it's just as long, whether

14:43.500 --> 14:46.792
you're single or married.

14:46.834 --> 14:48.625
And all the paperwork's

14:46.834 --> 14:48.625
right in here for you.

14:48.667 --> 14:50.083
OK. Thank you.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.417
Are you...

14:50.750 --> 14:52.417
Are these yours?

14:52.458 --> 14:53.709
Oh! Thank you!

14:53.750 --> 14:55.834
I'm sorry. I'm so silly.

14:55.875 --> 14:57.583
It happens to me all the time.

14:57.625 --> 14:59.208
I just forgot my bag!

15:02.083 --> 15:05.000
I don't mean to pry,

15:02.083 --> 15:05.000
but are you OK?

15:05.959 --> 15:08.959
Oh, yes.

15:05.959 --> 15:08.959
I'm just, I am...

15:10.166 --> 15:13.083
It's all just

15:10.166 --> 15:13.083
a little bit overwhelming.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.917
Yeah. I know.

15:15.792 --> 15:18.083
I, uh, heard you talking.

15:18.125 --> 15:21.875
Um, why do you want

15:18.125 --> 15:21.875
to do this alone?

15:23.542 --> 15:25.959
Uh, well, it hadn't

15:23.542 --> 15:25.959
really been the plan -

15:26.000 --> 15:28.333
but you know what?

15:28.375 --> 15:30.125
It's a long story.

15:30.166 --> 15:31.917
Right.

15:30.166 --> 15:31.917
You're the writer.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.792
That's funny.

15:36.583 --> 15:38.041
What about you?

15:36.583 --> 15:38.041
What do you do?

15:38.083 --> 15:40.166
I'm a photographer, actually.

15:40.208 --> 15:41.667
Well, I used to be

15:40.208 --> 15:41.667
a photographer.

15:42.417 --> 15:44.250
I better be going.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.709
OK. Do you have a card?

15:46.750 --> 15:49.000
I'm always

15:46.750 --> 15:49.000
looking for photographers.

15:49.041 --> 15:50.458
I do.

15:51.291 --> 15:53.291
Me too, somewhere.

15:55.709 --> 15:59.291
It's, um, well,

15:55.709 --> 15:59.291
it's kind of old.

16:00.625 --> 16:02.000
It's great.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.083
It works!

16:03.125 --> 16:04.792
- Thank you.

16:03.125 --> 16:04.792
- Sure.

16:04.834 --> 16:06.041
You're welcome.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.417
- Bye.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.417
- Bye.

16:21.709 --> 16:23.917
Hey, it's me!

16:21.709 --> 16:23.917
Where are you?

16:23.959 --> 16:25.125
In the kitchen.

16:27.166 --> 16:29.083
Thank God you live

16:27.166 --> 16:29.083
across the street.

16:29.125 --> 16:31.750
I am so stuck in a loop here.

16:31.792 --> 16:34.208
Whoa... Geez-o.

16:34.250 --> 16:36.166
Help a sister out, will you?

16:36.208 --> 16:37.917
Well, here we go!

16:37.959 --> 16:40.625
For medicinal purposes -

16:37.959 --> 16:40.625
isn't that what you need?

16:40.917 --> 16:42.375
Is there a cricket in the house?

16:42.417 --> 16:43.458
Yeah.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.125
That's going to

16:43.500 --> 16:45.125
drive me freaking mad.

16:45.166 --> 16:47.291
Oh, great.

16:45.166 --> 16:47.291
OK, shoo shoo the cricket.

16:47.333 --> 16:50.000
Yeah, I just feel

16:47.333 --> 16:50.000
so out of control.

16:50.041 --> 16:52.375
I mean, you'd think

16:50.041 --> 16:52.375
I'd be able to beat it.

16:52.417 --> 16:54.583
I wrote the damn book on it.

16:54.625 --> 16:56.083
Oh, come on.

16:56.125 --> 16:59.125
That was before

16:56.125 --> 16:59.125
your mom's death.

16:59.166 --> 17:01.000
Not to mention psycho-chick

17:01.041 --> 17:03.250
cheating on you

17:01.041 --> 17:03.250
with my girlfriend!

17:03.291 --> 17:05.290
It wasn't all her fault.

17:05.333 --> 17:10.208
You know, I was completely

17:05.333 --> 17:10.208
MIA once my mom got sick.

17:10.250 --> 17:13.250
Yeah, you're way too forgiving.

17:13.290 --> 17:14.625
Honestly, I don't know why

17:14.666 --> 17:16.375
you wanted to procreate

17:14.666 --> 17:16.375
with her anyway.

17:16.416 --> 17:18.834
I mean, you have

17:16.416 --> 17:18.834
seen "Rosemary's Baby."

17:21.290 --> 17:22.875
You know, at least

17:21.290 --> 17:22.875
with Margaret,

17:22.916 --> 17:24.040
we were compatible.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.458
[laughs]

17:26.290 --> 17:27.125
Yeah.

17:28.290 --> 17:29.625
Lombard!

17:29.667 --> 17:31.291
I've know you

17:29.667 --> 17:31.291
since high school,

17:31.333 --> 17:33.166
and you were with her

17:31.333 --> 17:33.166
because she was safe!

17:33.208 --> 17:35.291
There was about as much passion

17:33.208 --> 17:35.291
between you and Devil Woman

17:35.333 --> 17:37.333
as a bloody rice cracker!

17:37.375 --> 17:38.583
I mean, they're very nice.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.166
But I don't want

17:38.625 --> 17:40.166
one in my vagina,

17:40.208 --> 17:41.959
and I'm absolutely sure

17:40.208 --> 17:41.959
that you don't either!

17:43.125 --> 17:44.500
Oh, my God.

17:44.542 --> 17:47.458
And I know I'm different.

17:44.542 --> 17:47.458
You know?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.917
I go through 'em

17:47.500 --> 17:49.917
like socks in a drawer,

17:49.959 --> 17:52.959
but at least I get to feel.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.458
I get highs,

17:53.000 --> 17:57.458
lows, schmucky...

17:57.500 --> 18:00.208
And all good and fucky!

18:00.250 --> 18:03.125
So you are going to have to put

18:00.250 --> 18:03.125
your wonderful heart out there

18:03.166 --> 18:07.375
and get to feel all these

18:03.166 --> 18:07.375
wonderful feelings, too.

18:07.417 --> 18:09.875
But until that time,

18:07.417 --> 18:09.875
you are under strict orders

18:09.917 --> 18:12.291
to only do things that

18:09.917 --> 18:12.291
make you feel good.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.542
Not bad. Good.

18:15.792 --> 18:16.792
OK.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.834
Don't ever let them

18:23.500 --> 18:26.834
see your pain, Peyton.

18:28.041 --> 18:30.792
Don't let your

18:28.041 --> 18:30.792
guard down, ever.

18:32.333 --> 18:33.834
Look, Lombard.

18:33.875 --> 18:36.709
This love guru is supposed

18:33.875 --> 18:36.709
to be the absolute best.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.458
OK, Wave.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.250
Anything to get

18:38.500 --> 18:40.250
out of this house.

18:42.041 --> 18:44.333
Remember that chick

18:42.041 --> 18:44.333
I was seeing on Friday?

18:44.375 --> 18:45.291
Mmm, hmm.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.291
She was dating Erin and my ex.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.208
I don't even want to hear it.

18:49.250 --> 18:51.834
You said your eyes

18:49.250 --> 18:51.834
were wide open.

18:51.875 --> 18:52.834
Yeah, well?

18:52.875 --> 18:54.750
I'm legally blind

18:52.875 --> 18:54.750
in my left eye,

18:54.792 --> 18:57.375
so thank you very much

18:54.792 --> 18:57.375
for your sensitivity.

18:57.417 --> 18:59.291
You know what you're like?

18:59.333 --> 19:01.750
You're like the

18:59.333 --> 19:01.750
lesbian Jennifer Aniston.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.208
Why in the hell do you think

19:02.333 --> 19:04.208
we're going to this thing?

19:07.375 --> 19:09.250
Where are you

19:07.375 --> 19:09.250
going all dolled up?

19:09.291 --> 19:12.083
You know I'm going

19:09.291 --> 19:12.083
to Tyler's event.

19:12.125 --> 19:13.291
Oh, yeah, that's right.

19:13.333 --> 19:14.875
You know, I still don't get it.

19:14.917 --> 19:16.542
He was on his way to

19:14.917 --> 19:16.542
being one of the best

19:16.583 --> 19:18.041
directors in film school,

19:18.083 --> 19:20.792
and now he's messin' around

19:18.083 --> 19:20.792
with his soul foods?

19:20.834 --> 19:22.417
- Soulemetry.

19:20.834 --> 19:22.417
- Soulemetry?

19:22.458 --> 19:23.625
- Yeah.

19:22.458 --> 19:23.625
- Mmm, hmm.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.041
Yeah...

19:25.083 --> 19:26.667
I don't get it.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.291
He lives for this.

19:30.333 --> 19:33.208
And I live for...this.

19:35.291 --> 19:37.625
You know, maybe you could

19:35.291 --> 19:37.625
wear this next date night.

19:37.667 --> 19:39.333
- Yeah?

19:37.667 --> 19:39.333
- Yeah.

19:39.375 --> 19:42.250
Well, maybe if you get lucky,

19:39.375 --> 19:42.250
I'll get home early.

19:42.291 --> 19:43.375
- Yeah?

19:42.291 --> 19:43.375
- Yeah.

19:44.291 --> 19:45.166
See ya later.

19:47.083 --> 19:48.333
The cookie...

19:50.417 --> 19:51.709
Look, Lombard,

19:51.750 --> 19:54.834
this love guru is supposed

19:51.750 --> 19:54.834
to be the absolute best.

19:54.875 --> 19:57.500
Tell me why I have to

19:54.875 --> 19:57.500
go to this thing again.

19:57.542 --> 20:02.208
Because if I do find

19:57.542 --> 20:02.208
my soulmate, you must approve!

20:04.417 --> 20:07.458
And I figured we'd find

20:04.417 --> 20:07.458
you one while we're at it.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.417
♪  Love!  ♪

20:10.458 --> 20:16.667
♪  One and one are One  ♪

20:16.709 --> 20:20.667
♪  The heart of love  ♪

20:20.709 --> 20:27.625
♪  Reveals the beauty

20:20.709 --> 20:27.625
of our soul  ♪

20:28.875 --> 20:34.458
How many times do

20:28.875 --> 20:34.458
our eyes simply not see?

20:34.500 --> 20:37.917
Your soulmate could be standing

20:34.500 --> 20:37.917
right next to you right now,

20:37.959 --> 20:40.041
and you wouldn't even know it.

20:40.083 --> 20:42.583
That's because you

20:40.083 --> 20:42.583
have your true self,

20:42.625 --> 20:45.417
and what I call

20:42.625 --> 20:45.417
your celebrity self.

20:45.458 --> 20:46.875
The one that's

20:45.458 --> 20:46.875
obsessed with ego,

20:46.917 --> 20:48.458
the one that wants the hunk

20:48.500 --> 20:51.750
or the thick brown hair,

20:48.500 --> 20:51.750
the bedroom eyes.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.625
Ah, you know what I'm

20:51.792 --> 20:53.625
talking about, don't you?

20:53.667 --> 20:56.959
You know, you recognize,

20:53.667 --> 20:56.959
you really recognize.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.458
These pairings never work out.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.375
And when they fail,

21:00.500 --> 21:03.375
we wonder why, why, why,

21:03.417 --> 21:06.750
with our broken

21:03.417 --> 21:06.750
hearts and our bruised egos.

21:06.792 --> 21:08.250
Now don't get me wrong.

21:08.291 --> 21:10.834
I'm not saying physical

21:08.291 --> 21:10.834
attraction isn't important.

21:10.875 --> 21:12.250
Of course, it is.

21:12.291 --> 21:13.542
Hello!

21:13.583 --> 21:16.959
What I am saying

21:13.583 --> 21:16.959
is don't confuse

21:17.000 --> 21:19.083
the attraction to the physical

21:19.125 --> 21:21.834
with the yearning of the soul.

21:21.875 --> 21:25.625
Given its chance, the true self,

21:21.875 --> 21:25.625
the higher self will always

21:25.667 --> 21:29.542
break through to find

21:25.667 --> 21:29.542
its soul partner.

21:29.583 --> 21:34.417
And trust me, it could come from

21:29.583 --> 21:34.417
the person you least expect it.

21:37.458 --> 21:39.583
Chew on that...

21:37.458 --> 21:39.583
and some hors d'oeuvres.

21:39.625 --> 21:41.417
I'm going to start my

21:39.625 --> 21:41.417
readings in a few minutes.

21:41.458 --> 21:42.792
Welcome, welcome.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.333
[applause]

21:46.667 --> 21:48.625
That woman over there?

21:48.667 --> 21:50.417
No, no, don't look.

21:52.166 --> 21:54.625
She's trying to hit on me.

21:54.667 --> 21:56.000
Seriously!

21:58.917 --> 22:01.458
Oh, my God,

21:58.917 --> 22:01.458
she is not coming over here.

22:02.583 --> 22:04.500
Uh, excuse me...

22:02.583 --> 22:04.500
Pardon me.

22:06.458 --> 22:08.000
- Hey.

22:06.458 --> 22:08.000
- Hey.

22:09.917 --> 22:11.625
There you are.

22:09.917 --> 22:11.625
Oh, my God.

22:11.667 --> 22:14.000
Could she be any more stunning?

22:14.583 --> 22:16.333
- You were great.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.333
- Thank you.

22:16.375 --> 22:18.458
I am Tyler Montegue,

22:16.375 --> 22:18.458
and you are...

22:18.500 --> 22:19.709
Peyton.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.709
I actually met Peyton

22:19.750 --> 22:21.709
at the adoption center.

22:21.750 --> 22:23.041
Small world.

22:23.083 --> 22:26.041
Small world. Six degrees.

22:23.083 --> 22:26.041
What's that even mean?

22:26.083 --> 22:28.291
This delusion with accidents.

22:29.834 --> 22:31.458
I'm going to start my readings.

22:38.125 --> 22:41.917
Well, since this was

22:38.125 --> 22:41.917
obviously pre-ordained,

22:41.959 --> 22:44.375
do you wanna get a drink?

22:44.417 --> 22:46.291
- I would love to.

22:44.417 --> 22:46.291
- OK.

22:51.542 --> 22:55.709
I feel like I'm at the races,

22:51.542 --> 22:55.709
always picking the wrong horse.

22:55.750 --> 22:56.917
That's just it.

22:56.959 --> 22:59.458
Has it ever occurred

22:56.959 --> 22:59.458
to let love find you?

22:59.500 --> 23:02.333
Peyton, you're so brave...

23:02.375 --> 23:04.667
To want to have

23:02.375 --> 23:04.667
a baby on your own.

23:04.709 --> 23:07.500
You never thought

23:04.709 --> 23:07.500
about getting married?

23:07.542 --> 23:09.500
Oh, I was married.

23:09.542 --> 23:11.500
I thought you said

23:09.542 --> 23:11.500
you were single.

23:11.542 --> 23:13.959
I am - now.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
- Oh, I'm sorry.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
- That's OK.

23:19.667 --> 23:21.375
How long were you married?

23:21.417 --> 23:22.625
Six years.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.625
You?

23:26.667 --> 23:27.875
Fifteen.

23:27.917 --> 23:29.583
What happened?

23:31.208 --> 23:33.166
I don't know.

23:33.208 --> 23:35.875
I guess all the

23:33.208 --> 23:35.875
predictable stuff.

23:35.917 --> 23:38.458
My partner couldn't handle

23:35.917 --> 23:38.458
all the time I spent

23:38.500 --> 23:40.583
with my ailing mother.

23:40.625 --> 23:42.625
Your partner?

23:42.667 --> 23:43.792
Mm hmm.

23:44.500 --> 23:45.917
Your partner..

23:45.959 --> 23:48.208
You're, um...

23:48.250 --> 23:49.500
(both)

23:48.250 --> 23:49.500
Gay.

23:51.583 --> 23:55.750
Well, I think that

23:51.583 --> 23:55.750
that is just fine.

23:55.792 --> 23:58.583
I voted no on Prop 8.

23:58.625 --> 24:00.917
Or was it yes on Prop 8?

24:00.959 --> 24:03.542
I don't know, it was all

24:00.959 --> 24:03.542
very, very confusing,

24:03.583 --> 24:06.792
but I know that

24:03.583 --> 24:06.792
I voted the right way.

24:06.834 --> 24:08.959
I mean, I voted your way.

24:10.667 --> 24:13.583
I just, I don't want you to

24:10.667 --> 24:13.583
think that it's a problem for me

24:13.625 --> 24:15.125
because it's really not.

24:15.166 --> 24:17.500
I mean, why would it be?

24:17.542 --> 24:20.792
Oh, God, I'm sounding

24:17.542 --> 24:20.792
pretty ridiculous!

24:20.834 --> 24:21.917
You're fine.

24:21.959 --> 24:24.166
Well, apparently,

24:21.959 --> 24:24.166
I am inspiration

24:24.208 --> 24:26.792
for looking for love

24:24.208 --> 24:26.792
in all the wrong places.

24:29.166 --> 24:31.709
Well, it looks like

24:29.166 --> 24:31.709
this was a bust for me,

24:31.750 --> 24:34.208
- but, um, you two--

24:31.750 --> 24:34.208
- Wave.

24:34.250 --> 24:36.625
This is Elena Winters.

24:36.667 --> 24:38.083
Pleased to meet you.

24:38.125 --> 24:40.417
I really have to run.

24:40.458 --> 24:42.834
My husband has

24:40.458 --> 24:42.834
early services tomorrow.

24:44.125 --> 24:45.500
Barry's a pastor.

24:46.709 --> 24:47.875
Oh!

24:47.917 --> 24:50.083
Hmm, that, uh...

24:50.125 --> 24:51.625
Cool!

24:54.834 --> 24:57.625
It was nice

24:54.834 --> 24:57.625
running into you again.

24:57.667 --> 25:01.709
Pleased to meet you, Wave.

24:57.667 --> 25:01.709
I will see you, Peyton.

25:05.208 --> 25:06.542
[snickers]

25:06.583 --> 25:09.792
You fancy her...

25:06.583 --> 25:09.792
And she fancies you.

25:09.834 --> 25:11.542
Don't even talk to me.

25:12.709 --> 25:15.166
Did you know that a snail

25:12.709 --> 25:15.166
can sleep for three years?

25:15.208 --> 25:16.667
Mmm, mmm.

25:16.709 --> 25:19.041
Can you even imagine

25:16.709 --> 25:19.041
waking up one day

25:19.083 --> 25:22.667
to realize that you've literally

25:19.083 --> 25:22.667
slept half of your life away?

25:26.834 --> 25:30.291
Nash, I heard you

25:26.834 --> 25:30.291
skipped Bible study.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.709
Yup. Sure did.

25:32.750 --> 25:35.500
I really don't care what

25:32.750 --> 25:35.500
they're crusading against.

25:35.542 --> 25:36.583
And Dad doesn't either.

25:36.625 --> 25:37.750
Your Dad--

25:37.792 --> 25:39.959
Got the role of a lifetime, Mom.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.583
Playing pastor was the only

25:40.000 --> 25:42.583
gig he could actually book.

25:42.625 --> 25:45.166
C'mon... You know it.

25:45.208 --> 25:46.458
We all know it.

25:49.041 --> 25:50.291
What?

25:50.750 --> 25:52.333
[phone rings]

25:55.500 --> 25:57.333
Hello.

25:57.375 --> 25:59.500
Yeah, she's right here.

25:59.542 --> 26:00.709
- It's for you.

25:59.542 --> 26:00.709
- Oh.

26:02.959 --> 26:03.917
Hello?

26:05.083 --> 26:06.750
- Nash, take a jacket!

26:05.083 --> 26:06.750
- No.

26:06.792 --> 26:08.875
Would you make

26:06.792 --> 26:08.875
him take a jacket?

26:10.792 --> 26:11.875
Elena?

26:11.917 --> 26:13.667
Oh, hi, Peyton!

26:13.709 --> 26:15.500
Do you remember the

26:13.709 --> 26:15.500
women's glory project

26:15.542 --> 26:17.250
I was talking about?

26:17.291 --> 26:21.917
I was wondering if I could

26:17.291 --> 26:21.917
see some samples of your work.

26:23.083 --> 26:27.709
I could, um...

26:23.083 --> 26:27.709
bring my portfolio over...

26:27.750 --> 26:29.667
I could even do it tomorrow.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.583
These are good.

26:40.417 --> 26:41.750
I'm impressed.

26:44.834 --> 26:46.250
Aww...

26:46.291 --> 26:47.583
She's beautiful.

26:47.625 --> 26:49.291
Children are my

26:47.625 --> 26:49.291
favorite subjects.

26:49.333 --> 26:50.500
I love the set-up.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.041
They're so innocent, so raw.

26:52.083 --> 26:53.458
They show

26:52.083 --> 26:53.458
everything they're feeling.

26:57.625 --> 26:59.417
I love this one.

27:00.834 --> 27:02.500
That's me, actually.

27:05.166 --> 27:06.500
It's great.

27:06.542 --> 27:07.917
I had an idea.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.792
I lit it, and I thought...

27:07.959 --> 27:10.792
might as well.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.250
It's really good.

27:15.291 --> 27:17.709
I mean, they are all good.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.917
Why didn't you keep this up?

27:20.792 --> 27:25.041
You know, family.

27:25.083 --> 27:26.542
Life.

27:34.291 --> 27:37.625
I think it's

27:34.291 --> 27:37.625
a wonderful project, Peyton.

27:37.667 --> 27:40.417
I think you would be great,

27:37.667 --> 27:40.417
if you're interested.

27:40.458 --> 27:42.542
Yes! I'm definitely interested.

27:42.583 --> 27:43.625
OK.

27:45.917 --> 27:48.166
So where did this

27:45.917 --> 27:48.166
idea come from?

27:48.208 --> 27:50.291
Well, my mom got really sick.

27:50.333 --> 27:53.875
We ended up

27:50.333 --> 27:53.875
connecting just more deeply,

27:53.917 --> 27:57.250
and I realized how much

27:53.917 --> 27:57.250
more interesting she was

27:57.291 --> 27:59.500
than I ever

27:57.291 --> 27:59.500
gave her credit for.

27:59.542 --> 28:03.750
And women are so complex,

27:59.542 --> 28:03.750
so multi-dimensional.

28:03.792 --> 28:05.375
I just want to dig in.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.667
I want to show

28:05.417 --> 28:07.667
all their colors...

28:09.917 --> 28:16.875
Show everything that

28:09.917 --> 28:16.875
makes a woman so delicious!

28:16.917 --> 28:17.917
Oh.

28:18.834 --> 28:20.667
[cell phone beeping]

28:23.792 --> 28:25.291
I've got to run.

28:25.792 --> 28:27.000
Oh.

28:27.041 --> 28:30.917
But we can meet Sunday -

28:27.041 --> 28:30.917
if that's good for you,

28:30.959 --> 28:32.875
to keep things moving forward.

28:32.917 --> 28:33.917
Sure.

28:33.959 --> 28:35.250
That'd be great.

28:38.834 --> 28:40.542
- Bye.

28:38.834 --> 28:40.542
- Bye.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.166
Mmmm.

28:52.291 --> 28:56.125
How could you, of all people,

28:52.291 --> 28:56.125
manage to run out of coffee?

28:56.166 --> 28:57.834
Thank you so much.

28:58.792 --> 29:00.000
You can go.

29:00.041 --> 29:01.917
What's with you,

29:00.041 --> 29:01.917
ants in your pants?

29:01.959 --> 29:03.792
I have a business meeting.

29:04.583 --> 29:06.959
- Here? On a Sunday?

29:04.583 --> 29:06.959
- Yeah. I do.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.041
Um...

29:08.083 --> 29:09.417
Thank you so much

29:08.083 --> 29:09.417
for bringing this.

29:09.458 --> 29:10.417
Now give me a minute.

29:10.458 --> 29:12.875
- Oh! Hello!

29:10.458 --> 29:12.875
- Hi!

29:12.917 --> 29:14.041
It's Wave, right?

29:14.083 --> 29:15.917
Right! That would be me!

29:15.959 --> 29:18.959
So you must be the,

29:15.959 --> 29:18.959
uh, business meeting.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.750
- Yes.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.750
- Got it!

29:21.917 --> 29:24.041
- Come on in.

29:21.917 --> 29:24.041
- OK. Bye.

29:24.083 --> 29:25.875
When I say do stuff

29:24.083 --> 29:25.875
that feels good,

29:25.917 --> 29:27.834
I don't mean do

29:25.917 --> 29:27.834
straight, married stuff!

29:27.875 --> 29:29.166
OK.

29:29.208 --> 29:30.291
Don't start!

29:45.250 --> 29:47.959
Is this you?

29:45.250 --> 29:47.959
I mean, your story?

29:48.000 --> 29:50.166
- Yeah.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.166
- Oh, wow.

29:50.208 --> 29:52.375
I think of an agoraphobic,

29:52.417 --> 29:53.834
like in "Grey Gardens,"

29:52.417 --> 29:53.834
you know,

29:53.875 --> 29:56.417
all huddled up in a corner

29:53.875 --> 29:56.417
with a bunch of cats!

29:56.458 --> 30:00.083
Yeah, well, all the new meds

29:56.458 --> 30:00.083
make us far more acceptable.

30:00.125 --> 30:02.250
Really, I would

30:00.125 --> 30:02.250
never have known.

30:03.583 --> 30:05.166
Can I make a suggestion?

30:06.542 --> 30:08.667
You need a new author's photo.

30:08.709 --> 30:10.500
This one just

30:08.709 --> 30:10.500
doesn't do you justice!

30:10.542 --> 30:12.959
It's not about what

30:10.542 --> 30:12.959
I look like in my line of work.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.458
It's more about my words.

30:14.500 --> 30:15.917
Nonsense.

30:15.959 --> 30:18.875
I'm going to do a new

30:15.959 --> 30:18.875
author's photo for you...

30:18.917 --> 30:20.458
My gift.

30:20.500 --> 30:21.917
OK.

31:11.166 --> 31:13.000
- Hi!

31:11.166 --> 31:13.000
- Hi!

31:13.709 --> 31:15.125
This is my son!

31:15.166 --> 31:16.750
Nash! I've heard about you.

31:16.792 --> 31:18.250
Nice to meet you.

31:19.917 --> 31:22.625
- Hi.

31:19.917 --> 31:22.625
- And you must be Tori.

31:22.667 --> 31:24.417
And you must be the writer!

31:24.458 --> 31:26.166
You know what my

31:24.458 --> 31:26.166
dream job would be?

31:26.208 --> 31:28.041
Research assistant.

31:28.083 --> 31:30.375
I mean, I would do the

31:28.083 --> 31:30.375
deepest, meanest,

31:30.417 --> 31:33.041
most intimate statistical

31:30.417 --> 31:33.041
research on any given topic,

31:33.083 --> 31:35.250
and I would correlate

31:33.083 --> 31:35.250
and extrapolate,

31:35.291 --> 31:36.875
and I would give meaning,

31:36.917 --> 31:38.917
meaning to each

31:36.917 --> 31:38.917
and every single part.

31:38.959 --> 31:40.333
And it would just

31:38.959 --> 31:40.333
be so amazing!

31:40.375 --> 31:41.709
She'd be really great at it.

31:41.750 --> 31:43.625
Checkmate. I win.

31:43.667 --> 31:48.125
That is why you never

31:43.667 --> 31:48.125
take your eye off the ball.

31:48.166 --> 31:49.458
That's right!

31:49.500 --> 31:51.542
Please, darling, don't

31:49.500 --> 31:51.542
eviscerate the poor child.

31:51.583 --> 31:52.959
- Hey, Ty.

31:51.583 --> 31:52.959
- Mmm?

31:53.000 --> 31:54.792
Tell Peyton the story.

31:54.834 --> 31:56.500
Alright, if you insist.

31:56.542 --> 31:58.083
So...

31:58.125 --> 32:01.083
This earnest young writer comes

31:58.125 --> 32:01.083
to Hollywood to make his mark,

32:01.125 --> 32:03.500
and all very

32:01.125 --> 32:03.500
Youngblood Hawke, right?

32:03.542 --> 32:07.125
Very soon he realizes

32:03.542 --> 32:07.125
that, um, life is...

32:07.166 --> 32:09.250
seldom the stuff

32:07.166 --> 32:09.250
of romance novels.

32:09.291 --> 32:11.041
He buys himself a Lexus...

32:12.959 --> 32:15.542
Per chance, did you

32:12.959 --> 32:15.542
drive a white Lexus?

32:15.583 --> 32:17.417
No. Don't even say it.

32:17.458 --> 32:21.041
The owner of the clunker turns

32:17.458 --> 32:21.041
out to be the very assistant

32:21.083 --> 32:22.333
who gave him his start.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.417
Can you believe it?

32:23.458 --> 32:26.083
They would come

32:23.458 --> 32:26.083
at the exact same time.

32:26.125 --> 32:27.917
Soulemetry, soulemetry.

32:27.959 --> 32:29.000
Three months later....

32:29.041 --> 32:30.625
- Married.

32:29.041 --> 32:30.625
- They were married.

32:30.667 --> 32:32.542
Do you love it?

32:30.667 --> 32:32.542
Do you love it?!

32:32.583 --> 32:33.583
A coincidence!

32:33.625 --> 32:35.166
That's why God

32:33.625 --> 32:35.166
performs a miracle

32:35.208 --> 32:36.542
and decides to

32:35.208 --> 32:36.542
remain anonymous.

32:36.583 --> 32:38.083
No.

32:38.125 --> 32:41.583
It's when God gives you a choice

32:38.125 --> 32:41.583
and you make the right one.

32:41.625 --> 32:43.166
That's the miracle.

32:55.208 --> 32:59.458
I thought she'd be great

32:55.208 --> 32:59.458
to have a child with, you know?

32:59.500 --> 33:01.166
Make a family...

33:03.583 --> 33:07.041
You know, Barry and I

33:03.583 --> 33:07.041
only have one thing in common,

33:07.083 --> 33:10.166
and that's our son, so...

33:11.166 --> 33:12.333
I don't know.

33:12.375 --> 33:14.000
Sometimes I just

33:12.375 --> 33:14.000
think I got married

33:14.041 --> 33:15.834
to rebel against my parents.

33:15.875 --> 33:20.792
My father's Indian.

33:15.875 --> 33:20.792
He's...very old school.

33:20.834 --> 33:23.250
You know, stern but quiet hand.

33:23.291 --> 33:25.709
My mother's from Spain...

33:25.750 --> 33:29.417
She's very Catholic.

33:29.458 --> 33:32.250
Now that's a lethal combination.

33:32.291 --> 33:34.792
I know! It really is!

33:34.834 --> 33:36.250
It really is.

33:36.291 --> 33:39.333
For years I just have

33:36.291 --> 33:39.333
felt like a mummy.

33:39.375 --> 33:41.375
Just...

33:48.667 --> 33:52.250
Yeah, at first I was

33:48.667 --> 33:52.250
really happy with Barry.

33:53.667 --> 33:56.959
After some time, I...

33:57.000 --> 34:01.792
I just started to think,

33:57.000 --> 34:01.792
what's wrong with me?

34:01.834 --> 34:04.834
Why don't I feel what

34:01.834 --> 34:04.834
everybody else feels?

34:08.458 --> 34:11.250
I don't think I've ever

34:08.458 --> 34:11.250
been in love with him.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.125
But he's in love with you?

34:15.166 --> 34:16.291
I don't know.

34:16.333 --> 34:17.625
I think sometimes,

34:17.667 --> 34:21.250
marriage is just a series

34:17.667 --> 34:21.250
of compromises that...

34:21.291 --> 34:23.208
I don't know.

34:23.250 --> 34:28.166
Maybe some of us are not

34:23.250 --> 34:28.166
meant to have a soulmate...

34:28.208 --> 34:29.750
Like Tyler thinks.

34:34.291 --> 34:36.208
What about you?

34:37.041 --> 34:38.625
- Me?

34:37.041 --> 34:38.625
- Yeah.

34:40.542 --> 34:42.208
Well...

34:42.250 --> 34:46.291
I don't know about

34:42.250 --> 34:46.291
soulmates, but...

34:46.333 --> 34:48.583
I'm with Margaret...

34:48.625 --> 34:51.917
After that...

34:51.958 --> 34:56.291
Frankly, my dear,

34:51.958 --> 34:56.291
I don't care if I never see

34:56.333 --> 34:59.291
another lesbian

34:56.333 --> 34:59.291
for as long as I live.

35:01.250 --> 35:03.041
I'm not kidding.

35:03.083 --> 35:05.083
Oh, goodness.

35:09.583 --> 35:12.083
All I really want is a baby.

35:13.375 --> 35:14.834
And honestly, that's probably

35:14.875 --> 35:16.792
all I ever needed

35:14.875 --> 35:16.792
in the first place.

35:22.291 --> 35:24.417
This point is key.

35:24.458 --> 35:28.792
Everything feels

35:24.458 --> 35:28.792
completely brand new,

35:28.834 --> 35:30.583
but absolutely familiar.

35:32.208 --> 35:35.125
OK, you...

35:35.166 --> 35:36.166
Sit.

35:44.875 --> 35:46.375
OK.

35:54.291 --> 35:56.375
Can I ask you something?

35:57.667 --> 35:59.500
Uh, oh.

35:59.542 --> 36:01.375
It's a rather personal question.

36:02.458 --> 36:03.542
Go ahead.

36:07.417 --> 36:09.125
How did you know

36:07.417 --> 36:09.125
you were gay?

36:10.917 --> 36:12.458
How'd you know

36:10.917 --> 36:12.458
you were straight?

36:16.208 --> 36:18.834
I mean, did you know

36:16.208 --> 36:18.834
from the beginning?

36:18.875 --> 36:20.291
No.

36:20.333 --> 36:24.750
Actually, I did the

36:20.333 --> 36:24.750
whole straight thing

36:24.792 --> 36:27.417
up until my early 20s.

36:27.458 --> 36:31.750
But then, I fell

36:27.458 --> 36:31.750
head over heels

36:31.792 --> 36:35.625
for this, um,

36:31.792 --> 36:35.625
photographer, actually.

36:37.041 --> 36:38.333
Mmmm.

36:44.291 --> 36:47.458
Well, we can be very deep.

36:47.500 --> 36:48.792
Hmmm.

36:51.709 --> 36:53.375
What about you?

36:56.667 --> 36:58.375
Well, I never knew

36:56.667 --> 36:58.375
you were supposed

36:58.417 --> 37:00.417
to be anything but straight.

37:00.458 --> 37:03.709
No school girl crushes?

37:03.750 --> 37:08.250
No...Royal Academy

37:03.750 --> 37:08.250
experimentation?

37:09.458 --> 37:11.166
Nothing.

37:12.667 --> 37:16.417
I never even kissed a girl.

37:17.458 --> 37:19.375
No.

37:19.417 --> 37:21.500
With my upbringing,

37:21.542 --> 37:24.250
that never really

37:21.542 --> 37:24.250
occurred to me.

37:26.291 --> 37:28.375
I guess I'm just a square!

37:30.333 --> 37:32.208
Or maybe you're just straight.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.875
You mind if I move

37:56.500 --> 37:58.875
around a little bit?

38:03.875 --> 38:05.375
Pardon me?

38:08.125 --> 38:09.583
Oh...

38:09.625 --> 38:11.417
No, yeah, no.

38:13.625 --> 38:16.750
♪

38:40.917 --> 38:42.500
Yeah, I think I got it.

38:44.750 --> 38:45.959
Got it.

38:54.083 --> 38:55.500
That was great.

38:57.917 --> 39:01.166
[whistling]

39:11.625 --> 39:15.000
Uh, hey, Mama Bear.

39:15.041 --> 39:16.542
Hmmm?

39:16.583 --> 39:19.041
Are you aware

39:16.583 --> 39:19.041
that the entire time

39:19.083 --> 39:20.750
I've crashed here

39:19.083 --> 39:20.750
at your house,

39:20.792 --> 39:23.417
I have never once

39:20.792 --> 39:23.417
heard you whistle -

39:23.458 --> 39:27.291
a nonverbal expression of

39:23.458 --> 39:27.291
happiness or pleasure?

39:27.333 --> 39:29.917
Oh, come on.

39:27.333 --> 39:29.917
I'm sure I've whistled before.

39:34.083 --> 39:35.542
Hey, Tori...

39:39.125 --> 39:42.000
Do you know any...

39:42.041 --> 39:44.959
the gay girls

39:42.041 --> 39:44.959
at your school?

39:45.000 --> 39:46.583
You mean lesbians?

39:47.709 --> 39:50.500
Excuse me,

39:47.709 --> 39:50.500
but the last time I looked,

39:50.542 --> 39:53.041
you were hanging out

39:50.542 --> 39:53.041
with a lesbian named Peyton.

39:53.083 --> 39:54.583
Well, yeah,

39:53.083 --> 39:54.583
but Peyton's not really--

39:54.625 --> 39:56.000
Yeah, yeah, I know.

39:56.041 --> 39:57.709
She could pass for straight.

39:58.667 --> 40:03.208
Anyway, a normal person engages

39:58.667 --> 40:03.208
in the pursuit of kissing

40:03.250 --> 40:05.834
a mere 21,000

40:03.250 --> 40:05.834
plus or minus minutes

40:05.875 --> 40:08.583
in their sorry little lives.

40:08.625 --> 40:11.834
Which boils down

40:08.625 --> 40:11.834
roughly to mere months.

40:11.875 --> 40:14.667
So, who cares who kissing whom?

40:14.709 --> 40:16.250
- Really?

40:14.709 --> 40:16.250
- Really!

40:16.291 --> 40:19.875
I mean, over the lifespan

40:16.291 --> 40:19.875
of an average 80-year-old,

40:19.917 --> 40:22.834
they're only having

40:19.917 --> 40:22.834
sex six times a year.

40:24.041 --> 40:25.709
I mean, we take more baths

40:25.750 --> 40:28.166
and eat more chocolate bars,

40:25.750 --> 40:28.166
for gosh sakes!

40:28.208 --> 40:30.458
And yet, this whole gay thing,

40:28.208 --> 40:30.458
literally,

40:30.500 --> 40:32.542
has everybody from

40:30.500 --> 40:32.542
the religious right

40:32.583 --> 40:34.709
all the way to Papa Bear's

40:32.583 --> 40:34.709
knickers in a twist.

40:34.750 --> 40:36.041
I know.

40:36.083 --> 40:40.542
And FYI... he's no fan

40:36.083 --> 40:40.542
of your new friend either.

40:42.375 --> 40:43.542
What?!

40:44.000 --> 40:45.125
Mom...

40:45.166 --> 40:46.291
Don't worry.

40:46.333 --> 40:48.166
Dad's just grumbling

40:46.333 --> 40:48.166
about how much time

40:48.208 --> 40:50.041
you and Peyton spend together.

40:50.083 --> 40:52.583
But I personally think

40:50.083 --> 40:52.583
it's kinda cool,

40:52.625 --> 40:55.166
'cause you're not all

40:52.625 --> 40:55.166
caught up in the church,

40:55.208 --> 40:57.417
and it makes me kind of proud.

40:58.875 --> 41:01.041
Just so you're

40:58.875 --> 41:01.041
completely informed, Nash,

41:01.083 --> 41:03.291
according to the specialist

41:01.083 --> 41:03.291
who was on

41:03.333 --> 41:05.709
Queen Oprah the other day,

41:05.750 --> 41:07.542
straight women everywhere

41:07.583 --> 41:09.667
are suddenly wanting

41:07.583 --> 41:09.667
to be with other women -

41:09.709 --> 41:14.000
to experience their

41:09.709 --> 41:14.000
newfound, um, sexual fluidity.

41:16.834 --> 41:18.709
- You OK, Mom?

41:16.834 --> 41:18.709
- Yeah.

41:19.875 --> 41:21.208
Wow.

41:21.542 --> 41:22.583
Anyway...

41:22.625 --> 41:25.875
Um, lesbo 101 -

41:22.625 --> 41:25.875
in a nutshell.

41:25.917 --> 41:29.208
Yeah, but that's

41:25.917 --> 41:29.208
not my mom, so...

41:29.250 --> 41:31.667
Well, obviously,

41:29.250 --> 41:31.667
that's not Mama Bear.

41:32.542 --> 41:35.583
Don't get so defensive!

41:32.542 --> 41:35.583
Gosh!

41:35.625 --> 41:39.125
You know, I think you two are

41:35.625 --> 41:39.125
what Tyler calls Twin Flames.

41:39.166 --> 41:41.542
I do, and you found each

41:39.166 --> 41:41.542
other so early in life!

41:41.583 --> 41:43.458
Oh, Ma, come on!

41:44.583 --> 41:48.625
Think of all the time left

41:44.583 --> 41:48.625
you have to bicker, you two!

41:48.667 --> 41:50.000
Yeah.

41:51.625 --> 41:54.375
While your world's may seem

41:51.625 --> 41:54.375
utterly disconnected,

41:54.417 --> 41:57.041
the paths that you have

41:54.417 --> 41:57.041
individually taken

41:57.083 --> 41:59.375
bring you together

41:57.083 --> 41:59.375
at freakish randomness.

41:59.750 --> 42:03.959
My father was in the service so

41:59.750 --> 42:03.959
we jumped all over the world,

42:04.041 --> 42:06.875
and I made Spain my home.

42:06.917 --> 42:09.709
And my mother was a gypsy

42:06.917 --> 42:09.709
and so we travelled a lot,

42:09.750 --> 42:12.750
from one town to the next,

42:09.750 --> 42:12.750
and I ended up in LA.

42:12.792 --> 42:15.792
My best friend's brother,

42:12.792 --> 42:15.792
he had his wedding in New York,

42:15.834 --> 42:17.625
which is where we met.

42:17.667 --> 42:20.792
And we got stuck

42:17.667 --> 42:20.792
at the 'friends' table.

42:20.834 --> 42:23.625
You know, the table where nobody

42:20.834 --> 42:23.625
knows who the hell you are.

42:23.667 --> 42:25.542
You're just kind of

42:23.667 --> 42:25.542
like sitting there?

42:26.667 --> 42:27.834
And I, uh,

42:27.875 --> 42:30.625
I spilled champagne

42:27.875 --> 42:30.625
all over her dress.

42:30.667 --> 42:32.417
- Oh, all over my dress.

42:30.667 --> 42:32.417
- Yup.

42:32.458 --> 42:36.542
And then I freak, 'cause I,

42:32.458 --> 42:36.542
I realize how beautiful she is.

42:37.792 --> 42:39.917
- It still gives me goosebumps.

42:37.792 --> 42:39.917
- Yeah.

42:39.959 --> 42:44.625
We were born in the same town,

42:39.959 --> 42:44.625
Silverton, Oregon -

42:44.667 --> 42:47.542
less than 10,000 people -

42:47.583 --> 42:49.667
within a week of each other.

42:49.709 --> 42:53.709
We travelled nearly a million

42:49.709 --> 42:53.709
miles to find one another.

42:53.750 --> 42:56.500
And we did.

42:56.542 --> 43:01.750
And it is all because

42:56.542 --> 43:01.750
I asked him to pass the salt.

43:02.917 --> 43:04.834
You had that planned.

43:04.875 --> 43:07.417
I know. I did...

43:07.458 --> 43:08.792
It worked.

43:10.250 --> 43:12.625
I'm so glad that it's all

43:10.250 --> 43:12.625
going digity boop, you know?

43:12.667 --> 43:14.709
But, I don't know...

43:14.750 --> 43:17.667
Sounds a little scary,

43:14.750 --> 43:17.667
if I'm perfectly honest.

43:17.709 --> 43:18.834
Mmmm.

43:19.834 --> 43:21.667
I'm trying to talk to my friend?

43:21.709 --> 43:23.083
- Sorry.

43:21.709 --> 43:23.083
- God.

43:23.125 --> 43:24.250
Oh, hi!

43:25.709 --> 43:27.291
- You kill me.

43:25.709 --> 43:27.291
- I know.

43:27.333 --> 43:28.750
Seriously, though.

43:28.792 --> 43:30.750
C'mon.

43:30.792 --> 43:33.875
I think it's getting

43:30.792 --> 43:33.875
a little out of control, no?

43:35.458 --> 43:38.041
The unbuttoning of the shirt.

43:38.083 --> 43:40.709
What about all the eye blazing

43:38.083 --> 43:40.709
that goes on between you?

43:40.750 --> 43:42.667
I mean, come on.

43:40.750 --> 43:42.667
Who does that?

43:42.709 --> 43:45.375
Eye blazing? Seriously?

43:45.417 --> 43:48.125
You're the writer.

43:45.417 --> 43:48.125
Call it what you want.

43:48.166 --> 43:49.750
Seriously, though, you know,

43:49.792 --> 43:52.917
this is the oldest and most

43:49.792 --> 43:52.917
tragic game in the book!

43:52.959 --> 43:56.166
Lonely housewife meets quite

43:52.959 --> 43:56.166
fascinating lesbo

43:56.208 --> 43:58.375
to take a wee stroll

43:56.208 --> 43:58.375
on the wild side!

43:59.375 --> 44:03.625
You gotta grow some

43:59.375 --> 44:03.625
mini cojones - stat!

44:03.667 --> 44:05.250
You've gotta tell her

44:03.667 --> 44:05.250
what's going on.

44:05.291 --> 44:07.834
Yeah... No.

44:07.875 --> 44:09.875
No, no, no, I can't.

44:10.750 --> 44:13.417
Peyton, she's straight.

44:13.458 --> 44:17.417
And married to a pastor!

44:17.458 --> 44:19.709
Not to mention

44:17.458 --> 44:19.709
she's culturally challenged.

44:19.750 --> 44:22.750
It's kind of twisted how much

44:19.750 --> 44:22.750
you've got going against you.

44:22.792 --> 44:24.834
Alright, you belabor

44:22.792 --> 44:24.834
the obvious.

44:24.875 --> 44:27.041
I've added an

44:24.875 --> 44:27.041
assignment out of town.

44:27.083 --> 44:29.875
I'm gonna, when I come back...

44:27.083 --> 44:29.875
I've already decided.

44:29.917 --> 44:33.709
I'm gonna make

44:29.917 --> 44:33.709
myself less available.

44:33.750 --> 44:36.250
Actually unavailable.

44:36.291 --> 44:37.625
Oh!

44:37.667 --> 44:39.500
The I'm-too-busy-and-

44:37.667 --> 44:39.500
too-much-of-a-chicken-shit-

44:39.542 --> 44:40.875
to-tell-you-what's-

44:39.542 --> 44:40.875
really-going-on,

44:40.917 --> 44:42.917
fade-into-the-woodwork

44:40.917 --> 44:42.917
treatment.

44:42.959 --> 44:44.750
- Yup.

44:42.959 --> 44:44.750
- Oh.

44:44.792 --> 44:47.208
Well, I hope it works out.

44:47.250 --> 44:49.458
You came all the way

44:47.250 --> 44:49.458
over here to say that to me?

44:49.500 --> 44:51.500
- I did.

44:49.500 --> 44:51.500
- You could have just called.

44:51.542 --> 44:52.750
I did call.

44:57.917 --> 44:59.417
[doorbell chimes]

45:15.041 --> 45:16.250
Hey!

45:16.875 --> 45:17.917
Hi!

45:18.542 --> 45:20.583
I wanted to show

45:18.542 --> 45:20.583
you these pictures.

45:20.625 --> 45:24.208
God, Peyton, you look amazing!

45:20.625 --> 45:24.208
Really...

45:24.250 --> 45:25.750
Great! Wow.

45:25.792 --> 45:27.125
Um, um...

45:27.166 --> 45:29.041
I should have called first, huh?

45:29.083 --> 45:31.500
No, no, it's just, you didn't

45:29.083 --> 45:31.500
have to come all the way

45:31.542 --> 45:34.959
over...here, that's all.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.375
Yeah, maybe this

45:35.000 --> 45:37.375
isn't a good time.

45:37.417 --> 45:38.959
No...

45:37.417 --> 45:38.959
No, no, no.

45:39.000 --> 45:43.000
I, I, I was actually, um -

45:39.000 --> 45:43.000
you know what?

45:43.041 --> 45:46.166
Uh, this is as good

45:43.041 --> 45:46.166
a time as any.

45:46.208 --> 45:48.291
Can you give me a second?

45:48.333 --> 45:49.500
OK...

46:00.834 --> 46:02.959
Oh, my God.

46:00.834 --> 46:02.959
What am I doing?

46:04.083 --> 46:06.208
Pants, pants,

46:04.083 --> 46:06.208
pants, pants...

46:07.000 --> 46:08.291
Oh!

46:12.875 --> 46:14.583
Shirt is over here,

46:12.875 --> 46:14.583
shirt, shirt, shirt.

46:16.000 --> 46:16.834
You're kidding.

46:23.041 --> 46:24.250
Oh, my God.

46:24.959 --> 46:26.000
She won't even care.

46:31.375 --> 46:33.125
You're straight.

46:33.166 --> 46:34.166
And married.

46:40.750 --> 46:41.959
No big deal.

46:43.041 --> 46:44.375
Just tell her....

46:44.417 --> 46:45.583
Oh, my God.

46:50.750 --> 46:51.750
OK.

46:55.959 --> 46:56.959
Hey.

47:03.083 --> 47:05.333
Look, Elena--

47:05.375 --> 47:07.875
I really should have called...

47:05.375 --> 47:07.875
first.

47:07.917 --> 47:09.792
I need to talk to

47:07.917 --> 47:09.792
you about something.

47:09.834 --> 47:11.041
Sure.

47:12.333 --> 47:13.959
Are you OK?

47:14.000 --> 47:16.041
No, actually.

47:16.083 --> 47:19.792
This, I mean, nothing serious,

47:16.083 --> 47:19.792
it's just that, um...

47:21.208 --> 47:23.542
I...

47:24.375 --> 47:26.875
Would you like some breakfast,

47:24.375 --> 47:26.875
English tea and breakfast?

47:26.917 --> 47:29.125
For God sakes, what's going on?

47:29.166 --> 47:31.166
Uh, this is ridiculous.

47:32.875 --> 47:37.500
Alright, um, first of all,

47:32.875 --> 47:37.500
you're straight.

47:38.834 --> 47:40.542
And second of all -

47:40.583 --> 47:43.041
you're straight

47:40.583 --> 47:43.041
and married.

47:43.083 --> 47:46.625
And my God...

47:46.667 --> 47:50.250
I so didn't want this to happen.

47:55.375 --> 47:59.542
I mean, you know that

47:55.375 --> 47:59.542
I'm a lesbian.

47:59.583 --> 48:00.917
Right?

48:02.625 --> 48:05.542
Um, yes.

48:05.583 --> 48:06.834
OK.

48:06.875 --> 48:09.875
So...that's it.

48:11.166 --> 48:13.959
That's what?

48:14.000 --> 48:15.792
- What?

48:14.000 --> 48:15.792
- What I just said.

48:15.834 --> 48:17.083
Which is?

48:17.125 --> 48:18.208
Ah!

48:21.125 --> 48:24.000
You know...

48:24.041 --> 48:28.041
I...really like you.

48:28.917 --> 48:30.875
I like you, too.

48:32.625 --> 48:34.583
More than I should.

48:34.625 --> 48:36.208
So...

48:38.959 --> 48:41.959
We don't, you know, have to

48:38.959 --> 48:41.959
talk about it or anything.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.792
I mean,

48:42.000 --> 48:43.792
I'm fine with that.

48:43.834 --> 48:47.083
I just think that if we just

48:43.834 --> 48:47.083
don't spend time--

48:47.125 --> 48:49.250
No! No!

48:49.291 --> 48:51.750
No, God, Peyton.

48:49.291 --> 48:51.750
No!

48:51.792 --> 48:54.250
I don't want to not spend time!

48:54.291 --> 48:56.208
I mean, you just

48:54.291 --> 48:56.208
heard what I said.

48:56.250 --> 48:58.083
Yes, but we...

48:58.125 --> 49:01.125
We need to be

48:58.125 --> 49:01.125
in each others lives!

49:02.250 --> 49:04.834
I just found you!

49:04.875 --> 49:09.000
You're my absolute best friend

49:09.041 --> 49:12.250
and I know we can

49:09.041 --> 49:12.250
get around this.

49:12.291 --> 49:13.333
No.

49:13.375 --> 49:15.375
I don't want to not be with you.

49:17.083 --> 49:20.709
And you can have  all  of me.

49:22.375 --> 49:27.041
All of it except for that.

49:22.375 --> 49:27.041
All of me.

49:28.542 --> 49:30.083
OK.

49:30.125 --> 49:32.208
Just so you know...

49:32.250 --> 49:35.959
That  is a big

49:32.250 --> 49:35.959
deal for a lesbian.

49:37.500 --> 49:39.667
I mean, at least

49:37.500 --> 49:39.667
in the beginning.

49:42.166 --> 49:45.166
I just...

49:42.166 --> 49:45.166
Peyton, let's have some wine.

49:45.208 --> 49:47.000
Let's make a plan.

49:48.417 --> 49:53.000
Just please, please don't

49:48.417 --> 49:53.000
take you away from me.

49:58.750 --> 50:00.083
OK.

50:01.417 --> 50:02.792
OK.

50:04.709 --> 50:06.083
- I'll get some wine.

50:04.709 --> 50:06.083
- OK.

50:14.125 --> 50:18.625
Yes...these are God's children.

50:18.667 --> 50:22.291
But they have lost their way.

50:22.333 --> 50:26.417
And we cannot simply

50:22.333 --> 50:26.417
award this deviant path

50:26.458 --> 50:32.542
by allowing them the sacred

50:26.458 --> 50:32.542
sacrament of marriage.

50:32.583 --> 50:37.208
And they think if they

50:32.583 --> 50:37.208
can twist enough arms

50:37.250 --> 50:39.291
in the political arena

50:39.333 --> 50:42.583
that they can

50:39.333 --> 50:42.583
win this...prize.

50:46.250 --> 50:48.208
But marriage

50:46.250 --> 50:48.208
isn't a prize, is it?

50:49.917 --> 50:52.041
It's a gift.

50:52.083 --> 50:56.250
The greatest right that we have.

50:56.291 --> 50:59.041
And it should not be tarnished.

51:02.083 --> 51:05.333
It will NOT be tarnished!

51:09.250 --> 51:10.834
What the hell was that?

51:10.875 --> 51:13.417
Do you know what it looks like

51:10.875 --> 51:13.417
when you walk out of a sermon?

51:13.458 --> 51:14.959
Barry, don't.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.709
Look, you know, Elena,

51:16.750 --> 51:19.083
there's some of this stuff

51:16.750 --> 51:19.083
that I just have to do.

51:19.125 --> 51:20.291
Yes.

51:20.333 --> 51:22.625
I am familiar with the

51:20.333 --> 51:22.625
greater good speech.

51:22.667 --> 51:24.625
And you've always been good

51:22.667 --> 51:24.625
about these compromises -

51:24.667 --> 51:25.709
until now...

51:25.750 --> 51:28.291
You've had gay friends before.

51:28.333 --> 51:30.875
[with accent]

51:28.333 --> 51:30.875
Back in your grand

51:28.333 --> 51:30.875
theater days.

51:30.917 --> 51:33.291
Nash, I'm just saying

51:30.917 --> 51:33.291
I think people should know

51:33.333 --> 51:35.542
they should not be rewarded

51:33.333 --> 51:35.542
for bad behavior.

51:35.583 --> 51:38.291
Bad behavior?

51:35.583 --> 51:38.291
Get real, Dad!

51:38.333 --> 51:39.959
Selling your soul

51:38.333 --> 51:39.959
is bad behavior.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.667
Loving someone isn't!

51:45.041 --> 51:48.166
You know, it's only a matter

51:45.041 --> 51:48.166
of time before this entire

51:48.208 --> 51:52.625
marriage discussion

51:48.208 --> 51:52.625
is so 2000 and late.

51:54.333 --> 51:58.542
Everyone knows Millie's the

51:54.333 --> 51:58.542
money at Papa Bear's church.

51:58.583 --> 52:01.250
Maybe we should

51:58.583 --> 52:01.250
cut him some slack,

52:01.291 --> 52:04.875
'cause he's pretty screwed

52:01.291 --> 52:04.875
if he doesn't toe the line.

52:07.417 --> 52:10.166
Are you hungry?

52:10.208 --> 52:12.166
I'm going to make some dinner.

52:12.417 --> 52:15.875
This person makes

52:12.417 --> 52:15.875
you see the world

52:15.917 --> 52:17.959
through a different filter.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.583
No matter how hard you try,

52:18.000 --> 52:21.583
this person is suddenly living

52:21.625 --> 52:23.667
in every corner of your mind.

52:33.417 --> 52:36.375
I don't know what to say,

52:33.417 --> 52:36.375
I, um...

52:36.417 --> 52:39.583
You know, I spent the whole

52:36.417 --> 52:39.583
day looking at lesbian sites.

52:49.041 --> 52:51.625
No, I'm not attracted...

52:49.041 --> 52:51.625
to them.

52:51.667 --> 52:53.375
I'm not...

52:53.417 --> 52:55.917
attracted to any of

52:53.417 --> 52:55.917
the women in them...

52:57.417 --> 52:59.333
I don't think

52:57.417 --> 52:59.333
I'm a lesbian, Peyton.

53:04.291 --> 53:07.500
You're not the only

53:04.291 --> 53:07.500
one with feelings.

53:09.750 --> 53:12.291
Oh, I'm so confused, Peyton.

53:33.834 --> 53:37.792
Can't we just agree

53:33.834 --> 53:37.792
to call it a serious crush?

53:39.875 --> 53:42.875
Oh, all I can think about is...

53:47.792 --> 53:49.542
You OK?

53:49.583 --> 53:50.834
Yeah.

53:52.291 --> 53:53.792
Something's burning.

[doorbell chimes]

54:07.333 --> 54:08.417
Hey!

54:28.959 --> 54:31.291
Oh, I knew you'd feel like this.

54:34.291 --> 54:35.875
Oh, so soft.

54:39.125 --> 54:41.291
So soft like velvet.

54:45.834 --> 54:46.959
Stop.

54:49.625 --> 54:51.291
Don't go any further.

54:52.500 --> 54:54.166
You can leave now

54:52.500 --> 54:54.166
if you want to.

54:55.542 --> 54:56.917
Really?

54:58.583 --> 55:01.417
Are you afraid to

54:58.583 --> 55:01.417
be alone with me?

55:02.458 --> 55:03.291
Yes.

55:05.583 --> 55:07.000
Seriously?

55:08.667 --> 55:10.333
Seriously.

58:02.834 --> 58:04.000
Hi!

Hey, are you busy?

No, I'm free.

Yeah.

Do you want to have dinner?

58:15.792 --> 58:17.208
Great.

58:18.125 --> 58:20.083
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

58:21.125 --> 58:22.208
OK.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.750
- Hi!

58:28.000 --> 58:29.750
- Hi!

58:30.208 --> 58:31.875
I thought you guys

58:30.208 --> 58:31.875
went to the movies!

58:31.917 --> 58:33.208
We missed you too much.

58:33.250 --> 58:35.166
It was sold out, Mom.

58:33.250 --> 58:35.166
Can we have some burgers?

58:35.208 --> 58:36.583
- Dinner's in the fridge.

58:35.208 --> 58:36.583
- Awesome!

58:36.625 --> 58:39.041
- Did you pick up some beer?

58:36.625 --> 58:39.041
- In the fridge.

58:49.083 --> 58:51.667
Yes. I see.

58:51.709 --> 58:54.959
But only because God's

58:51.709 --> 58:54.959
love heals and allows me

58:55.000 --> 58:58.625
to see the sin within myself,

58:58.667 --> 59:01.750
to purge those temptations -

59:01.792 --> 59:05.375
those desires that

59:01.792 --> 59:05.375
are the devil's work.

59:05.417 --> 59:10.417
And only with God's love,

59:05.417 --> 59:10.417
God's glorious love...

59:17.458 --> 59:20.417
How many of us want to

59:17.458 --> 59:20.417
push those terrible urges

59:20.458 --> 59:24.542
from those base human impulses?

59:24.583 --> 59:28.333
Those craven desires of flesh

59:28.375 --> 59:30.542
that push us to do things

59:28.375 --> 59:30.542
we know are wrong?

59:36.625 --> 59:38.750
I don't know.

59:36.625 --> 59:38.750
I can't decide.

59:40.250 --> 59:41.625
I love this one.

59:41.667 --> 59:46.417
It's got this essence

59:41.667 --> 59:46.417
of like, comrades, you know?

59:47.041 --> 59:50.375
But this one -

59:47.041 --> 59:50.375
oh, it's just so damn good.

59:52.834 --> 59:54.542
What do you think?

59:54.583 --> 59:55.750
Hmmm?

01:00:00.208 --> 01:00:02.250
Make love to me, Peyton.

01:00:05.875 --> 01:00:08.500
I thought you wanted to wait...

01:00:08.542 --> 01:00:10.291
To see if you...

01:00:19.667 --> 01:00:21.625
Peyton, make love to me.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:31.667
I want to, Elena, trust me.

01:00:32.291 --> 01:00:37.125
But...once we go there,

01:00:32.291 --> 01:00:37.125
there's no going back.

01:01:01.166 --> 01:01:03.083
I don't want to go back.

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:34.750
Are you OK?

01:02:36.875 --> 01:02:38.125
Yes.

01:02:40.208 --> 01:02:41.750
Are you?

01:04:18.792 --> 01:04:20.959
Elena...

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.291
stay with me...

01:05:00.125 --> 01:05:02.750
(voices on monitor)

01:05:00.125 --> 01:05:02.750
Oh, I know how I knew.

01:05:02.792 --> 01:05:08.250
Um, when you kiss, it's like you

01:05:02.792 --> 01:05:08.250
live inside that kiss forever...

01:05:08.709 --> 01:05:10.458
Hey, sweetie,

01:05:08.709 --> 01:05:10.458
just give me a second.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.125
...but yet it feels brand new.

01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:21.792
It is a good thing she is

01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:21.792
not a controlled substance.

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:23.417
- Yeah!

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:23.417
- That's all I'm sayin'.

01:05:23.458 --> 01:05:25.333
She's far more dangerous.

01:05:25.375 --> 01:05:28.125
OK, I'll bite.

01:05:25.375 --> 01:05:28.125
So...

01:05:28.166 --> 01:05:32.125
What's with the shimmering

01:05:28.166 --> 01:05:32.125
new and improved you, huh?

01:05:32.166 --> 01:05:33.583
Oh, Tyler...

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:39.166
What you are doing is

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:39.166
the very definition of insanity.

01:05:39.208 --> 01:05:41.166
I'm in love.

01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:45.166
For the first time,

01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:45.166
for the only time in my life.

01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:47.125
Gorgeous straight housewife.

01:05:47.166 --> 01:05:48.875
Never had sex

01:05:47.166 --> 01:05:48.875
with a woman before.

01:05:48.917 --> 01:05:50.542
Thinks she's died

01:05:48.917 --> 01:05:50.542
and gone to heaven.

01:05:50.583 --> 01:05:51.917
Now what?

01:05:54.792 --> 01:05:56.750
What happened to you telling me

01:05:56.792 --> 01:05:58.875
to do things that

01:05:56.792 --> 01:05:58.875
make me feel good?

01:05:58.917 --> 01:06:01.959
OK, I am trying to put

01:05:58.917 --> 01:06:01.959
my cynicism on one side.

01:06:03.208 --> 01:06:04.583
Good.

01:06:04.625 --> 01:06:08.041
'Cause I'd just like to

01:06:04.625 --> 01:06:08.041
stay in my happy place

01:06:08.083 --> 01:06:10.542
for a second more,

01:06:08.083 --> 01:06:10.542
if you don't mind.

01:06:10.583 --> 01:06:11.667
Oh, happy place.

01:06:11.709 --> 01:06:12.500
Oh my God!

01:06:12.542 --> 01:06:13.875
Alright, OK.

01:06:13.917 --> 01:06:17.125
Now that you have completely

01:06:13.917 --> 01:06:17.125
taken my breath away,

01:06:17.166 --> 01:06:19.375
we're gonna sit down, and you're

01:06:17.166 --> 01:06:19.375
gonna tell me everything.

01:06:19.417 --> 01:06:21.625
Yeah, you two walk

01:06:19.417 --> 01:06:21.625
off into the sunset,

01:06:21.667 --> 01:06:24.125
no dead bodies strewn behind...

01:06:24.166 --> 01:06:29.250
Alright, I mean, every

01:06:24.166 --> 01:06:29.250
teeny, tiny, minuscule, minute,

01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:32.750
infinitesimal,

01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:32.750
mother fucking detail!

01:06:32.792 --> 01:06:35.375
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:06:36.041 --> 01:06:38.041
Are you done now?

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:41.041
- Probably.

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:41.041
- That's great.

01:06:41.083 --> 01:06:43.083
Now I have this big

01:06:41.083 --> 01:06:43.083
fat foreclosure sign

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:44.875
on my happy place.

01:06:44.917 --> 01:06:46.917
I'm so happy!

01:06:46.959 --> 01:06:48.667
I can see it!

01:06:48.709 --> 01:06:50.542
Oh!

01:06:50.583 --> 01:06:52.083
It's OK.

01:06:52.125 --> 01:06:53.417
Perhaps some

01:06:52.125 --> 01:06:53.417
of you are thinking,

01:06:53.458 --> 01:06:56.166
epic love can't happen to me.

01:06:56.208 --> 01:07:00.208
But when true love enters

01:06:56.208 --> 01:07:00.208
your life, epic happens.

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:05.125
We worked in the same

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:05.125
company all of our lives.

01:07:05.166 --> 01:07:09.083
And for 27 years,

01:07:05.166 --> 01:07:09.083
we passed each other by

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:12.458
and never said

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:12.458
one word to each other.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:16.166
Sometimes he would

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:16.166
nod and smile.

01:07:16.208 --> 01:07:18.667
But always very pleasant.

01:07:18.709 --> 01:07:20.542
Then I had a heart attack.

01:07:20.583 --> 01:07:25.125
I thought I don't have much more

01:07:20.583 --> 01:07:25.125
time to let things pass me by.

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:27.834
I'm not going to waste

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:27.834
one more minute.

01:07:27.875 --> 01:07:30.917
So when he came back to work,

01:07:27.875 --> 01:07:30.917
he came right up to me and said,

01:07:30.959 --> 01:07:34.083
I'm not going to waste

01:07:30.959 --> 01:07:34.083
one more minute of my life.

01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:35.542
I'm not Fred Astaire,

01:07:35.583 --> 01:07:38.041
but I'd like to

01:07:35.583 --> 01:07:38.041
take you dancing.

01:07:39.208 --> 01:07:45.291
And after three weeks of that

01:07:39.208 --> 01:07:45.291
wonderful dancing date,

01:07:45.333 --> 01:07:47.125
we were married.

01:07:47.166 --> 01:07:49.250
And we haven't spent

01:07:47.166 --> 01:07:49.250
a moment apart since.

01:07:49.291 --> 01:07:50.709
Mmm, hmm.

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:54.291
The heart knows

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:54.291
what the heart knows.

01:07:54.333 --> 01:07:56.083
- Right?

01:07:54.333 --> 01:07:56.083
- Right.

01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:00.333
You are desperate

01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:00.333
to be with them,

01:08:00.375 --> 01:08:03.083
and you will move heaven

are you doing home?

01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:25.917
You know better

01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:25.917
than to cut school.

01:23:25.959 --> 01:23:27.083
Oh...

01:23:27.125 --> 01:23:29.125
Is this the pot

01:23:27.125 --> 01:23:29.125
calling the kettle black?

01:23:29.166 --> 01:23:31.041
Father God knows all?

01:23:31.083 --> 01:23:33.500
Except for apparently

01:23:31.083 --> 01:23:33.500
what's going on around here.

01:23:34.458 --> 01:23:36.083
What's that supposed to mean?

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.417
[gasps]

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.417
Oh, my God!

01:24:00.458 --> 01:24:03.875
Your son is quickly on the

01:24:00.458 --> 01:24:03.875
verge of becoming unmanageable.

01:24:03.917 --> 01:24:05.667
I'm always here for Nash!

01:24:05.709 --> 01:24:07.208
No! You're not!

01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:08.959
Nash is going through

01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:08.959
something right now,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.792
and I need you to get your

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.792
head back in the game.

01:24:13.667 --> 01:24:15.250
I'm going to bed.

01:24:35.959 --> 01:24:37.792
I love the way

01:24:35.959 --> 01:24:37.792
you make me feel.

01:24:40.458 --> 01:24:42.667
And since your mom is

01:24:40.458 --> 01:24:42.667
missing half the goddamn time.

01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:44.333
Can you spell clueless?

01:24:44.375 --> 01:24:46.834
Hey!

01:24:44.375 --> 01:24:46.834
You don't talk to me that way.

01:24:46.875 --> 01:24:49.250
No matter what else happens,

01:24:46.875 --> 01:24:49.250
I'm still your father.

01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:53.083
Your mom is just

01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:53.083
following her heart.

01:24:57.041 --> 01:25:00.291
Every time I think

01:24:57.041 --> 01:25:00.291
it's impossible

01:25:00.333 --> 01:25:02.250
to love you more, I do.

01:25:04.917 --> 01:25:06.125
Ever deeper.

01:25:26.834 --> 01:25:27.917
Hello?

01:25:28.208 --> 01:25:29.750
Where is she?

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:32.375
I've been calling non-stop

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:32.375
for the past two hours.

01:25:32.417 --> 01:25:33.834
Tori?

01:25:33.875 --> 01:25:35.583
Look.

01:25:33.875 --> 01:25:35.583
I'm on your side, OK?

01:25:35.625 --> 01:25:37.291
So you can drop the pretense.

01:25:37.333 --> 01:25:39.542
Nash is in trouble.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.667
Tori?

01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:43.875
He lifted some really nasty

01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:43.875
Boonesberry, got snookered

01:25:43.917 --> 01:25:45.959
and then returned to

01:25:43.917 --> 01:25:45.959
the scene of the crime

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.583
for some Doritos,

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.583
of all things.

01:25:47.625 --> 01:25:49.750
- Is he safe?

01:25:47.625 --> 01:25:49.750
- Typical acting out with teens.

01:25:49.792 --> 01:25:51.542
Their frontal lobe doesn't

01:25:49.792 --> 01:25:51.542
take into consideration--

01:25:51.583 --> 01:25:54.041
- Tori! Is he safe?

01:25:51.583 --> 01:25:54.041
- Not to worry!

01:25:54.083 --> 01:25:57.667
Once they found out Papa Bear

01:25:54.083 --> 01:25:57.667
was a pastor, they let him out.

01:25:57.709 --> 01:26:02.083
Now they're both at home,

01:25:57.709 --> 01:26:02.083
wondering where you are.

01:26:04.625 --> 01:26:06.125
I gotta go.

01:26:11.125 --> 01:26:12.291
Nash?

01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:17.834
Nash?

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:20.250
What were you thinking?

01:26:20.291 --> 01:26:22.083
What the hell

01:26:20.291 --> 01:26:22.083
were you thinking?

01:26:22.125 --> 01:26:23.750
Excuse me?

01:26:23.792 --> 01:26:26.166
What are we talking about here?

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:32.041
You and your

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:32.041
dirty little secret!

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.375
Yeah!

01:26:35.417 --> 01:26:37.417
I read her letters!

01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:42.750
I even liked her!

01:26:46.583 --> 01:26:47.834
Nash!

01:26:47.875 --> 01:26:49.208
What were you doing

01:26:47.875 --> 01:26:49.208
going through my things?!

01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:51.583
Don't you dare

01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:51.583
turn this around on me.

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:55.667
Nash, listen to me.

01:26:56.667 --> 01:26:59.000
I wasn't looking for this.

01:26:59.041 --> 01:27:01.834
God knows I don't

01:26:59.041 --> 01:27:01.834
really understand it.

01:27:01.875 --> 01:27:04.291
And I certainly didn't

01:27:01.875 --> 01:27:04.291
realize what was happening

01:27:04.333 --> 01:27:06.417
until it was too late.

01:27:06.458 --> 01:27:07.667
You  are  going to tell Dad.

01:27:07.709 --> 01:27:10.542
I certainly planned on

01:27:07.709 --> 01:27:10.542
telling him before you!

01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:14.166
So then what?

01:27:14.208 --> 01:27:16.333
Are you guys going

01:27:14.208 --> 01:27:16.333
to get a divorce?

01:27:17.583 --> 01:27:19.583
I'm not sure, Nash...

01:27:20.959 --> 01:27:23.291
I don't really

01:27:20.959 --> 01:27:23.291
know what I'm doing.

01:27:24.667 --> 01:27:26.250
Then stop!

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.792
Now, I think he's

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.792
an asshole half the time,

01:27:29.834 --> 01:27:31.959
but this will kill him, Mom.

01:27:32.792 --> 01:27:35.542
It will blow his

01:27:32.792 --> 01:27:35.542
whole ridiculous act.

01:27:36.625 --> 01:27:39.583
I mean, how's he supposed

01:27:36.625 --> 01:27:39.583
to guide his fawning flock

01:27:39.625 --> 01:27:42.250
when his wife is sleeping

01:27:39.625 --> 01:27:42.250
with the enemy?

01:27:46.166 --> 01:27:48.583
Nash, I need you to

01:27:46.166 --> 01:27:48.583
understand something.

01:27:48.625 --> 01:27:50.458
I have never been dishonest

01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:53.417
or cheated on your

01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:53.417
father before this.

01:27:54.667 --> 01:27:57.583
But I've never been

01:27:54.667 --> 01:27:57.583
in love with him either.

01:27:57.625 --> 01:28:00.375
Then why, Mom?

01:28:00.417 --> 01:28:03.041
Why stay with him

01:28:00.417 --> 01:28:03.041
this whole time?

01:28:03.083 --> 01:28:04.542
Why do you think, honey?

01:28:20.375 --> 01:28:22.417
It's OK, baby.

01:28:28.917 --> 01:28:31.000
Where were you?

01:28:31.041 --> 01:28:32.583
As if I have to ask.

01:28:38.458 --> 01:28:40.709
I already told you...

01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:42.458
I was at the park.

01:29:01.583 --> 01:29:04.875
Even with challenges

01:29:01.583 --> 01:29:04.875
seemingly insurmountable,

01:29:04.917 --> 01:29:07.417
true love will find a way.

01:29:10.166 --> 01:29:14.208
So we met in group.

01:29:10.166 --> 01:29:14.208
Big surprise.

01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:17.041
And, uh, it was weird

01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:17.041
because my Robert,

01:29:17.083 --> 01:29:19.208
who rarely comes out,

01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:21.709
just fell so head-over

01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:21.709
for her Jane.

01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:25.000
Thing is, her Jane is in control

01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:25.000
of all her personalities.

01:29:25.041 --> 01:29:27.375
Yeah, but it's

01:29:25.041 --> 01:29:27.375
still hell for me.

01:29:27.417 --> 01:29:29.458
Because when I want Robert,

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:32.500
I have to do battle

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:32.500
with all his alters.

01:29:32.542 --> 01:29:34.917
And to be quite frank,

01:29:34.959 --> 01:29:39.458
he's got some rather

01:29:34.959 --> 01:29:39.458
unappealing personas.

01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:43.959
But when Robert does

01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:43.959
come through...

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.458
Oh, my God.

01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:50.750
My Jane is just so deeply

01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:50.750
and completely in love with him.

01:29:53.959 --> 01:29:55.542
I love you.

01:29:57.875 --> 01:29:59.375
Robert?

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.083
Jane.

01:30:08.458 --> 01:30:10.458
I missed you so much.

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:11.542
Hi.

01:30:14.917 --> 01:30:16.000
Hi.

01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:29.667
Come here.

01:30:31.709 --> 01:30:35.125
It may be cliche,

01:30:31.709 --> 01:30:35.125
but it's true.

01:30:35.166 --> 01:30:37.750
Love really can conquer just

01:30:35.166 --> 01:30:37.750
about anything out there.

01:30:37.792 --> 01:30:41.041
- Do you really think so?

01:30:37.792 --> 01:30:41.041
- I really think so.

01:30:42.834 --> 01:30:45.583
Look, I know things are

01:30:42.834 --> 01:30:45.583
crazy over there right now,

01:30:45.625 --> 01:30:48.458
but I just wanted to

01:30:45.625 --> 01:30:48.458
make sure Nash is OK.

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:49.667
Call me.

01:30:51.083 --> 01:30:54.125
I feel like it's about

01:30:51.083 --> 01:30:54.125
to devastate everything I know.

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:57.583
What am I doing?

01:30:57.625 --> 01:31:00.166
Look at all the

01:30:57.625 --> 01:31:00.166
people I'm hurting!

01:31:03.041 --> 01:31:08.834
You can't rewrite the past,

01:31:03.041 --> 01:31:08.834
but you can reframe the present.

01:31:10.208 --> 01:31:13.166
What a gift

01:31:10.208 --> 01:31:13.166
you have been given!

01:31:13.208 --> 01:31:18.500
I have never seen you

01:31:13.208 --> 01:31:18.500
so alive and joyous

01:31:18.542 --> 01:31:21.667
and in touch

01:31:18.542 --> 01:31:21.667
and full of passion!

01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:24.250
Peyton makes you breathe!

01:31:28.792 --> 01:31:30.542
- You alright?

01:31:28.792 --> 01:31:30.542
- Yeah.

01:31:47.083 --> 01:31:48.709
Are you sitting down?

01:31:53.709 --> 01:31:56.208
I'm telling you, I just saw

01:31:53.709 --> 01:31:56.208
her kissing another woman

01:31:56.250 --> 01:31:58.750
in the plain light of day.

01:31:58.792 --> 01:32:00.542
I knew something

01:31:58.792 --> 01:32:00.542
was up with her.

01:32:00.583 --> 01:32:03.500
Not wanting to protest,

01:32:00.583 --> 01:32:03.500
missing services.

01:32:03.542 --> 01:32:05.542
But this!

01:32:06.917 --> 01:32:09.542
I know this week

01:32:06.917 --> 01:32:09.542
has been really rough.

01:32:10.917 --> 01:32:14.291
She must be one of those...

01:32:10.917 --> 01:32:14.291
I can't even say it.

01:32:14.333 --> 01:32:15.709
I, I, I, don't...

01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:17.959
the word just doesn't

01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:17.959
come out of my mouth...

01:32:18.959 --> 01:32:20.041
Lesbian.

01:32:21.291 --> 01:32:22.583
Oh my gosh.

01:32:21.291 --> 01:32:22.583
She's going to hell.

01:32:23.333 --> 01:32:27.792
Maybe we should pull

01:32:23.333 --> 01:32:27.792
back a little, you know?

01:32:27.834 --> 01:32:30.709
Just until things settle down.

01:32:33.792 --> 01:32:35.667
You don't have

01:32:33.792 --> 01:32:35.667
to feel so guilty.

01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:37.750
And I can get my

01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:37.750
head screwed back on.

01:32:37.792 --> 01:32:40.458
Where is all this coming from?

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.083
You don't get it.

01:32:43.834 --> 01:32:47.583
I am...too far in.

01:32:57.917 --> 01:33:01.709
I understand

01:32:57.917 --> 01:33:01.709
that you're scared,

01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:08.250
and all the reasons

01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:08.250
that you don't trust.

01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:12.750
Don't you know by now,

01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:12.750
Peyton, this is what I want?

01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:16.000
I have never lied to you.

01:33:16.041 --> 01:33:17.625
And I never will.

01:33:17.667 --> 01:33:21.041
I guess at this point,

01:33:17.667 --> 01:33:21.041
I really don't know that, Elena.

01:33:22.625 --> 01:33:24.125
You don't believe me?

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:28.917
I knew when

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:28.917
I was getting into it...

01:33:31.709 --> 01:33:34.208
It is what it is.

01:33:31.709 --> 01:33:34.208
I just...

01:33:36.834 --> 01:33:38.458
I just don't think I can do it.

01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:42.000
Peyton...

01:33:42.041 --> 01:33:44.458
This just can't

01:33:42.041 --> 01:33:44.458
happen overnight.

01:33:44.834 --> 01:33:48.041
I have been married

01:33:44.834 --> 01:33:48.041
for fifteen years.

01:33:48.083 --> 01:33:52.834
My family won't -

01:33:48.083 --> 01:33:52.834
they can't - understand this.

01:33:52.875 --> 01:33:55.792
Just give me some time.

01:33:52.875 --> 01:33:55.792
I...

01:33:55.834 --> 01:33:57.458
What?

01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:00.709
I can... I can work it out!

01:34:02.041 --> 01:34:06.792
I just need to know that you're

01:34:02.041 --> 01:34:06.792
going to be there with me.

01:34:07.875 --> 01:34:11.667
I believe they call that having

01:34:07.875 --> 01:34:11.667
your cake and eating it, too.

01:34:14.625 --> 01:34:19.834
I don't think that

01:34:14.625 --> 01:34:19.834
I can do this halfway.

01:34:20.834 --> 01:34:23.125
You are doing it halfway.

01:34:25.959 --> 01:34:28.792
I saw them with my own eyes,

01:34:25.959 --> 01:34:28.792
and it should come from me.

01:34:28.834 --> 01:34:33.792
He trusts me,

01:34:28.834 --> 01:34:33.792
and I'm the one to do it.

01:34:35.917 --> 01:34:38.083
Don't you see a future with us?

01:34:40.917 --> 01:34:41.917
Sorry.

01:34:43.458 --> 01:34:45.875
Maybe limited,

01:34:43.458 --> 01:34:45.875
but no, I...

01:34:52.959 --> 01:34:54.458
I'm sorry.

Peyton, honey, what's wrong?

01:36:56.625 --> 01:36:58.083
Peyton, honey,

01:36:56.625 --> 01:36:58.083
what's the matter?

01:36:58.125 --> 01:37:01.125
It's Molly...

01:36:58.125 --> 01:37:01.125
She's moving.

01:37:01.166 --> 01:37:04.250
And I love her so much!

01:37:04.291 --> 01:37:07.291
Get a hold of yourself.

01:37:04.291 --> 01:37:07.291
Get a hold of yourself.

01:37:07.333 --> 01:37:10.000
This is an important

01:37:07.333 --> 01:37:10.000
lesson to learn in life.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.083
When you love,

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.083

01:37:16.125 --> 01:37:19.291
It's just the way it is...

You know what the

hell you're doing?

01:38:23.125 --> 01:38:24.709
I didn't come to fight...

01:38:26.125 --> 01:38:27.875
I knew you'd need this.

01:38:30.583 --> 01:38:34.083
You know, Elena,

01:38:30.583 --> 01:38:34.083
maybe Nash was right.

01:38:34.125 --> 01:38:35.709
You know,

01:38:34.125 --> 01:38:35.709
maybe I am clueless,

01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:38.125
but I know one thing

01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:38.125
if I know nothing else.

01:38:38.166 --> 01:38:39.917
You are  not  a lesbian.

01:38:41.333 --> 01:38:43.500
You're right. I'm not.

01:38:43.542 --> 01:38:46.667
Then why the hell

01:38:43.542 --> 01:38:46.667
are you doin' this?

01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:48.917
To us?

01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:48.917
To Nash?

01:38:48.959 --> 01:38:52.125
I mean, it just doesn't

01:38:48.959 --> 01:38:52.125
make any sense to me.

01:38:52.166 --> 01:38:54.041
And don't even get me

01:38:52.166 --> 01:38:54.041
started on how selfish this is.

01:38:54.083 --> 01:38:55.375
Nash needs us.

01:38:55.417 --> 01:38:57.125
You're right.

01:38:55.417 --> 01:38:57.125
Nash needs us.

01:38:57.166 --> 01:39:00.000
He needs us.

01:38:57.166 --> 01:39:00.000
The real us...

01:39:00.041 --> 01:39:02.166
The best of us!

01:39:02.208 --> 01:39:04.208
My God, Barry,

01:39:02.208 --> 01:39:04.208
I'm done lying...

01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:05.041
What?

01:39:05.083 --> 01:39:07.000
To him! To you!

01:39:05.083 --> 01:39:07.000
To myself!

01:39:07.041 --> 01:39:08.542
This...

01:39:08.583 --> 01:39:10.250
It has nothing to

01:39:08.583 --> 01:39:10.250
do with Peyton.

01:39:10.291 --> 01:39:11.959
It has everything

01:39:10.291 --> 01:39:11.959
to do with Peyton.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
This is my decision

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
about my son and my life!

01:39:14.041 --> 01:39:16.917
I should have been done

01:39:14.041 --> 01:39:16.917
with this charade years ago!

01:39:18.083 --> 01:39:19.250
Charade?

01:39:19.291 --> 01:39:21.625
A Charade?

01:39:19.291 --> 01:39:21.625
Are you serious?

01:39:21.667 --> 01:39:23.959
You got on this

01:39:21.667 --> 01:39:23.959
thing from the very start!

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.375
And that was selfish.

01:39:25.417 --> 01:39:29.375
Being here, and not really

01:39:25.417 --> 01:39:29.375
being inside it with you.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.375
I'm done with this Barry.

01:39:33.417 --> 01:39:36.750
And if it's selfish, so be it.

01:39:36.792 --> 01:39:40.333
- It is selfish.

01:39:36.792 --> 01:39:40.333
- Barry, I'm done with this.

01:39:40.375 --> 01:39:42.709
- Elena, I--

01:39:40.375 --> 01:39:42.709
- I'm done.

01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:10.417
I finished all the classes,

01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:10.417
did all the paperwork.

01:40:10.458 --> 01:40:13.792
She said that I can be looking

01:40:10.458 --> 01:40:13.792
at placements within weeks.

01:40:13.834 --> 01:40:15.792
Oh, God!

01:40:15.834 --> 01:40:17.375
And that's because you're not,

01:40:17.417 --> 01:40:18.959
you're not letting

01:40:17.417 --> 01:40:18.959
anything get in your way.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.458
No, no. No worries.

01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:23.333
Keeping one focus,

01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:23.333
and one focus only.

01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:27.125
Gosh, Wave,

01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:27.125
I'm going to be a mom!

01:40:27.166 --> 01:40:28.333
Yeah!

01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:30.959
I'll be right around

01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:30.959
for auntie duty

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.250
just after that whaa! stage.

01:40:33.291 --> 01:40:35.041
You'll be there.

01:40:35.083 --> 01:40:36.959
Hey, I know it's taken a while,

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.333
but you finally look like

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.333
you're among the living.

01:40:39.375 --> 01:40:41.208
And that would be the spray tan.

01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:48.166
Hey.

01:40:50.583 --> 01:40:52.917
Wow, that is so bizarre.

01:40:52.959 --> 01:40:55.291
I was just reading this

01:40:52.959 --> 01:40:55.291
morning about the correlation

01:40:55.333 --> 01:40:58.375
of coincidence with the

01:40:55.333 --> 01:40:58.375
concept of fatalism.

01:40:58.417 --> 01:40:59.834
Oh, yeah?

01:40:59.875 --> 01:41:02.417
Which would, you know,

01:40:59.875 --> 01:41:02.417
throw a great deal of weight

01:41:02.458 --> 01:41:05.375
to the premise that all of us

01:41:02.458 --> 01:41:05.375
running into one another was...

01:41:05.417 --> 01:41:07.250
probably inevitable.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.208
Elena.

01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:19.333

- No!

01:41:49.250 --> 01:41:52.333
- You played me!

01:41:52.375 --> 01:41:54.000
- I didn't.

01:41:52.375 --> 01:41:54.000
- Yeah, you did.

01:42:07.542 --> 01:42:09.166
I don't belong there.

01:42:09.208 --> 01:42:11.166
You couldn't know.

01:42:11.208 --> 01:42:13.959
Peyton, you took a chance.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.333
You know, you took

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.333
a huge, beautiful risk.

01:43:20.291 --> 01:43:24.166
Just sit, and listen.

01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:49.375
I know you're upset...

01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:49.375
but please understand.

01:43:51.583 --> 01:43:55.750
This entire last year was

01:43:51.583 --> 01:43:55.750
never supposed to happen.

01:43:55.792 --> 01:43:58.291
It was never even

01:43:55.792 --> 01:43:58.291
imaginable to me.

01:43:58.333 --> 01:44:01.166
I fell in love with you...

01:44:01.208 --> 01:44:02.959
A woman.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.625
Yes, I'm pregnant,

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.625
but it's not because

01:44:05.667 --> 01:44:08.667
I've been sleeping with Barry.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.750
Barry hasn't touched me

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.750
since we started.

01:44:15.166 --> 01:44:17.750
It's Tyler...

01:44:17.792 --> 01:44:19.917
Tyler's the father.

01:44:20.667 --> 01:44:23.083
Trust me, we weren't

01:44:20.667 --> 01:44:23.083
sleeping together either.

01:44:23.125 --> 01:44:24.458
Lily would have--

01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:29.291
After all those years

01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:29.291
of infertility hell...

01:44:29.333 --> 01:44:32.250
Tyler offered and I accepted.

01:44:34.417 --> 01:44:37.250
It's my greatest

01:44:34.417 --> 01:44:37.250
contribution to mankind.

01:44:39.458 --> 01:44:41.291
- You OK?

01:44:39.458 --> 01:44:41.291
- Yeah.

01:44:52.458 --> 01:44:54.250
Why didn't you tell me?

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.875
After all this time.

01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:01.417
My God,

01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:01.417
I was so hateful to you.

01:45:01.458 --> 01:45:04.291
Peyton, I must have tried to

01:45:01.458 --> 01:45:04.291
call you a thousand times,

01:45:04.333 --> 01:45:08.333
but I...

01:45:04.333 --> 01:45:08.333
I had things to take care of.

01:45:08.375 --> 01:45:10.250
Nash...

01:45:10.291 --> 01:45:12.375
Barry...

01:45:13.542 --> 01:45:15.291
Starting my divorce.

01:45:17.709 --> 01:45:20.709
And during that time,

01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:24.500
Tyler's little guys

01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:24.500
hit the jackpot,

01:45:24.542 --> 01:45:26.208
and I got pregnant.

01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:36.917
I just need you to know...

01:45:36.959 --> 01:45:40.208
that none...

01:45:40.250 --> 01:45:43.375
none of what

01:45:40.250 --> 01:45:43.375
we had was a lie.

01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:50.333
It was the truest

01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:50.333
thing I have ever known.

01:45:58.458 --> 01:46:00.041
I'm so sorry.

01:46:02.208 --> 01:46:05.500
I'm so sorry that I was

01:46:02.208 --> 01:46:05.500
so hateful...

01:46:05.542 --> 01:46:07.083
I'm so sorry.

01:46:16.583 --> 01:46:18.041
Look at me.

01:46:23.667 --> 01:46:25.625
- You're pregnant!

01:46:23.667 --> 01:46:25.625
- Yeah.

01:46:25.667 --> 01:46:27.750
That's awesome!

01:46:25.667 --> 01:46:27.750
So awesome!

01:46:30.583 --> 01:46:32.166
I miss you.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.542
I miss you, too.

01:46:36.625 --> 01:46:37.834
You're so beautiful.

01:46:39.917 --> 01:46:41.792
Oh, I've missed you so much.

01:46:42.792 --> 01:46:44.375
I've missed you so much.
