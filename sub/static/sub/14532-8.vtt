WEBVTT

00:04.755 --> 00:05.881
Previously on "Power"...

00:06.048 --> 00:07.925
So how the fuck you know
about this place?

00:08.090 --> 00:09.468
I know about everything.

00:09.635 --> 00:10.955
For now we got to do
what he says.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.438
I don't care what
the Serbian Hannibal Lecter says, Ghost.

00:13.597 --> 00:14.723
I'll handle this my own way.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.410
You're not gonna
sell drugs in my club.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.276
I am in your home
with your family.

00:18.435 --> 00:22.406
Think of them the next time
you want to betray me.

00:22.564 --> 00:26.068
You have everything
to lose, Duse.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.738
You have immense value.

00:29.905 --> 00:32.704
This is the best time
to be alive.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.426
So you know nothing
about the cell phone

00:34.576 --> 00:36.374
found at the Lobos murder scene?

00:36.537 --> 00:37.584
- No.
- No.

00:37.746 --> 00:38.747
- No.
- No.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.958
You keep saying
there's an inside man.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.797
- Maybe it's you.
- Look into Angela.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.303
She's involved.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.901
We need to talk
to James St. Patrick.

00:46.004 --> 00:49.349
You killed Lobos,
and the DOJ thinks I participated.

00:49.508 --> 00:52.978
You're gonna let me get the death penalty
for something I didn't do.

If you're gonna try
to ransom me or some shit,

02:43.914 --> 02:45.791
Ghost ain't the type
that's gonna pay.

02:48.085 --> 02:52.181
No, I do not plan to keep you here
against your will.

02:52.339 --> 02:56.515
After last night's gathering,
well, a man in your condition

02:56.677 --> 02:58.429
I would not leave alone.

02:58.595 --> 03:02.850
Okay, well, I don't know
what the fuck your angle is,

03:03.016 --> 03:07.021
but if you're not keeping me,

03:07.187 --> 03:09.315
I'd like to get
the fuck out of here now.

03:09.481 --> 03:10.824
Da.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.326
Tatiana will stitch you up,
then Petar will drive you home,

03:13.485 --> 03:15.613
and you rest.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.497
We will come for you later.

03:17.656 --> 03:20.409
We have business to discuss.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.541
<i>Okay.</i>

03:23.704 --> 03:26.503
You're a popular man, Mr. Egan.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.087
Come, Rishka.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.057
Where's Lobos?

03:44.808 --> 03:46.151
I don't know.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.936
I handled my end.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.103
Lobos went with your men.
Have you heard from them?

03:50.128 --> 03:52.506
No.

03:57.612 --> 04:01.788
Just the federal government looking
for the inside man and his accomplice.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.757
Let me get the phone
you used to call me.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.792
I have to destroy it.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.675
I need to get out of the country.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.839
I need a plane ticket,
and I need money.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.510
Si.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.440
Lobos told me where they are.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.068
Bring me the ticket
and the money.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.322

04:52.876 --> 04:54.674
It's like you fell off the grid.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.177
What happened to your face?

04:58.340 --> 05:00.593
Callahan is still breathing.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.558
Our Serbian friend
don't like my loyalty to the church.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.564
Yeah, he came
by the apartment, too, man.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.943
- He threatened the kids.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.579
the Feds found Lobos's body.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.539
Well, I ain't surprised.

05:26.701 --> 05:27.998
Are you?

05:28.161 --> 05:30.129
That's because
you fucked up the plan.

05:30.288 --> 05:33.258
They know that whoever shot Lobos
had inside information.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.893
They think Angela
might have been the leak.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.678
Did Hugo give you
the name of his inside man?

05:36.837 --> 05:39.037
No, and I ain't trying to find him
to find out, neither.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.233
He's been blowing me up,
probably trying to set up a meet

05:41.258 --> 05:42.778
so he can shoot me
in the fucking face.

05:42.937 --> 05:45.177
You got to let him set up that meet.
We have to find out.

05:45.202 --> 05:47.022
Why, for Angela?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.523
No, Ghost. Fuck that.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.309
No, for us.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.818
We're connected.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.604
If they arrest her
as the inside man,

05:53.770 --> 05:55.730
then they come looking
at us as the shooters, man.

05:55.755 --> 05:57.507
She goes down,
we go down with Angela.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.077
Exactly. You got to call Hugo.

06:01.236 --> 06:03.079
Fuck.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.745
Yes, thank you
for the surveillance footage.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.505
I just received it.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.792
Great. Bye.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.427
Come on.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.066
There you are.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.234
Well done, Jamie.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.487
Unfortunately,
we cannot overlook the fact

06:43.653 --> 06:46.406
that Mr. Ruiz has
broken the law for years.

06:46.573 --> 06:50.077
And we're willing
to make a generous offer,

06:50.243 --> 06:51.443
but it will include jail time.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.331
My client revealed incriminating
information about himself

06:54.497 --> 06:56.465
in exchange for
your guarantee of immunity.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.845
Well, his agreement was attached
to helping us convict Lobos.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.425
No Lobos, no immunity.

07:01.588 --> 07:02.965
So my deal is dead?

07:03.131 --> 07:05.930
Maybe there's another way
to look at this thing, right?

07:06.092 --> 07:08.470
You know I'm interested in Ghost.

07:08.637 --> 07:12.016
And you want to send me inside
even after I agreed to help you?

07:12.182 --> 07:14.651
You couldn't protect Lobos.
How you gonna protect me?

07:14.809 --> 07:17.403
I'll be dead in a day, so...

07:17.562 --> 07:19.189
fuck you, and fuck off.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.074
Vámonos.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.419
That Tatiana bitch is alive?

07:32.577 --> 07:34.875
And was in your house
like it was nothing?

07:37.624 --> 07:40.503
- Guess Milan knew about the tip.
- Yeah, he knew.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.589
But he didn't know
it was you that made the call,

07:42.614 --> 07:45.242
so that's how we're gonna keep it.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.261
So what are we gonna do?

07:51.388 --> 07:53.891
He knows everything
about me, Andre,

07:54.057 --> 07:56.731
so I got to know
everything about him.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.816
I'm working on that.

07:58.979 --> 08:02.108
For now, it's only club business
when we talk in here, okay?

08:02.273 --> 08:04.822
Speaking of club business,
she ain't looking good, man.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.864
Them bitch-ass motherfuckers
across the street, Andy and Alby?

08:08.029 --> 08:10.407
They swooped in and got the deal
with Karen, bro.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.792
It was in the paper today.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.329

You double-crossed us.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.772
You were supposed to kill him.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.781
I guess I forgot.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.942
We think your inside contact
betrayed Lobos,

09:28.109 --> 09:29.611
so just give us his name.

09:29.778 --> 09:31.826
We'll find him. We'll get even.

09:34.783 --> 09:37.536
You ever been set on fire
before, Hugo?

09:37.702 --> 09:39.500
It's crazy, it smells like bacon,

09:39.662 --> 09:42.461
except it's more personal.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.878
You know this man
can identify you, right?

09:46.044 --> 09:48.092
He's a loose end.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.970
El nombre.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.261
I want his fucking name.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.223
I'm not done with him yet.

09:58.389 --> 10:00.107
<i>Okay.</i>

10:00.266 --> 10:02.626
Tommy, let's get him in the car.
It's gonna be a long night.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.009
Come on, stupid. You heard him.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.947
Move it!

10:07.857 --> 10:10.701
When Lobos finds out
about this, you're dead.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.488
Yeah?
I ain't too worried about Lobos.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.659
Oh, no, you don't worry
about your own life,

10:16.825 --> 10:21.001
but you cried
over a stupid little dog.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.756
Hey, what'd your woman say
when she found it?

10:23.915 --> 10:26.418
Did she cry, too?

10:26.584 --> 10:28.086
Did you cry together?

10:28.253 --> 10:30.173
- Fuck you, you fucking piece of sh...
- Tommy...

10:31.131 --> 10:32.633
No!

10:34.968 --> 10:37.596
Fuck, man.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.890
Tommy, what the fuck?

10:40.056 --> 10:41.656
We could have fucking
made him talk, man.

10:41.681 --> 10:44.569
Now we got squat 'cause you can't
fucking control yourself.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.071
I can control myself just fine!

10:47.230 --> 10:49.028
He had to go.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.783
Yo, and fuck Angela.

10:50.942 --> 10:53.570
Tell your bitch not to talk
if they step to her.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.239
I'm getting the fuck out of here,

10:56.406 --> 10:58.408
and I'ma keep this gun.

11:27.770 --> 11:31.195
You think somebody in this office
really leaked the Lobos information?

11:31.357 --> 11:33.109
Or are they just fucking with us?

11:33.276 --> 11:35.995
- They didn't arrest anybody.
- Not yet.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.451
What are you saying?

11:37.614 --> 11:39.694
You better not be saying it was me,
'cause I'm clean.

11:39.719 --> 11:42.077
Probably one of you or Sandoval.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.166
This is what MJ wants,
us arguing,

11:44.329 --> 11:45.876
set us up against each other.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.757
I don't know, make us paranoid.

11:47.916 --> 11:51.261
Well, it's not paranoia
if one of us gets the needle.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.638
- That's reality.
- Who mentioned the death penalty?

11:53.796 --> 11:55.969
- Donovan.
- White Donovan or black Donovan?

11:56.132 --> 11:57.725
Hey.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.761
- Hey, Jerry.
- Saxe.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.930
Main Justice is gone.

12:02.096 --> 12:03.769
They're headed to Eastern District.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.572
They're running point
on the Lobos murder.

12:05.597 --> 12:07.853
I just came
from a debrief over there.

12:08.019 --> 12:09.737
So spill. What do they got?

12:09.896 --> 12:11.819
It was definitely
a premeditated hit.

12:11.981 --> 12:15.827
There was a fresh grave
waiting for Lobos, but it wasn't used.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.579
Looks like he ran for his life,
was caught and then shot

12:18.738 --> 12:21.457
multiple times in the chest
at close range by a man

12:21.616 --> 12:23.118
who already had him subdued.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.877
Feels personal, you know?

12:25.036 --> 12:26.709
Any hard leads on the doer?

12:26.871 --> 12:28.623
No, but this is interesting.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.918
Only one set of bullets in Lobos,

12:31.084 --> 12:35.134
but he was walked in the woods
by two men, two sets of footprints.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.139
Duty calls.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.354
- Enjoy the bagels.
- Later.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.108
They require so much.

12:55.275 --> 12:59.621
I was arranging a a pickup
for my son after school.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.908
- Do you have kids?
- No, I don't.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.543
So how can I help you,
Ms. Hazen?

13:05.702 --> 13:08.046
I want to talk with you

13:08.204 --> 13:11.504
about your relationship
with Angela Valdes.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.464
You used her once

13:13.626 --> 13:16.721
to help your drug-dealing friend
Egan beat a rap.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.302
That worked so well,
I think you did it a second time.

13:19.465 --> 13:24.062
I think you used her to help Egan
kill his supplier, Felipe Lobos,

13:24.220 --> 13:26.973
and I'd like to offer you immunity
for your testimony

13:27.140 --> 13:29.939
against AUSA Valdes.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.945
I don't have any idea
of what you're talking about.

13:33.104 --> 13:34.981
You were living with her.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.197
You paid her rent,
got her guard down.

13:38.359 --> 13:41.784
You used her classified information

13:41.946 --> 13:44.290
to commit capital murder.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.578
Turn her in, Mr. St. Patrick.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.167
You're a smart man.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.549
It's the smart play.

13:54.709 --> 13:59.636
Did AUSA Valdes give you information
about Felipe Lobos?

14:02.633 --> 14:05.557
And who is Felipe Lobos again?

14:05.720 --> 14:08.894
All the hitters spoke Spanish
except for one guy, he spoke English.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.776
White, New York accent,
probably Queens.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.607
It's a local.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.613
Now, I've been thinking about it.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.649
I think it was Tommy Egan.

14:17.815 --> 14:20.495
- Not this shit again, Knox.
- I saw Lobos get grabbed by three men.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.067
Now, we got two bodies, right?

14:22.230 --> 14:23.283
- Right.
- Right?

14:23.446 --> 14:26.950
Leaves one guy, except there were
two sets of non-Lobos footprints

14:27.116 --> 14:30.086
found in the woods,
Egan and St. Patrick.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.417
St. Patrick.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.253
Should have seen that one coming.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.840
You know, first you ask me
to pull info for you on Ruiz

14:38.002 --> 14:39.549
while you're suspended.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.912
- Well...
- Yeah, that's right.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.300
I found out you were suspended.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.066
I don't even want to know
how you knew that Lobos was still alive.

14:46.232 --> 14:47.872
Didn't even know he was stabbed.
Didn't...

14:47.900 --> 14:50.307
- Let's just... let's just go with it.
- Okay.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.851
Why would Egan kill Lobos, Greg?

14:55.061 --> 14:58.691
Why would a distro want to kill
his international supplier,

14:58.856 --> 15:01.530
a cartel leader who keeps him
balls-deep in cash?

15:01.692 --> 15:03.569
Yup.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.328
Maybe there's a new connect.

15:08.491 --> 15:11.165
Maybe doesn't work
for me, all right?

15:11.327 --> 15:15.252
I want facts, so till you get me
something real, lose my number.

15:15.415 --> 15:15.915
Okay.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.929
You selling contraband cigarettes
out of Truth now?

15:26.092 --> 15:27.852
So they are illegally imported.
I thought so.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.933
There's no stamp.

15:30.096 --> 15:33.191
Look, I'm trying to locate a man
who makes himself very hard to find.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.067
I think he's illegally importing those.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.524
Look, I'm vice, not customs.

15:37.687 --> 15:38.813
But I go! A 9"!!-

15:38.980 --> 15:41.199
- I can make a call...
- No, no, no, listen to me.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.077
This has to stay
just between us, all right?

15:44.318 --> 15:48.243
Donato, if you help me out on this,
I'll make it worth your while,

15:48.406 --> 15:51.580
set you up with the biggest bust
of your career, man.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.871
L just need an address,
a warehouse, maybe a garage,

15:55.037 --> 15:56.914
I don't know,
somewhere where someone

15:57.081 --> 15:58.583
can store these for distribution.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.106
All right, well, I can't help you
with a warehouse, but retail.

16:03.131 --> 16:05.055
I'll give you the names
of some bars I've busted

16:05.214 --> 16:06.682
selling those under the counter.

16:06.841 --> 16:09.435
Maybe you go in,
find out where they get 'em.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.595
Hey, look, pal, you're gonna
have to do the legwork.

16:14.620 --> 16:17.874
And probably a lot of drinking, too,
if you want to get people to talk.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.865
Get me the names of the bars.

16:29.864 --> 16:33.494
You keep showing up here in the middle
of the day like it ain't nothing.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.002
Ain't you got a goddamn job?

16:35.161 --> 16:37.789
I do, putting murdering
drug dealers in jail.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.253
What do you do?

16:40.416 --> 16:43.920
Jamie's alibi for the Lobos murder
will hold up.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.214
You won't say a word.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.382
What about Tom my?
Where was he that day?

16:50.259 --> 16:52.557
How should I know?
I'm not his fucking babysitter.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.897
Expect an official visit
from the FBI.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.107
If Tommy's innocent,

17:00.269 --> 17:03.944
his alibi better hold up,
whatever it is.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.867
I think Tommy was
with his mother that day,

17:10.029 --> 17:12.202
out on Long Island.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.592
Shit.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.059
Holy shit.

17:41.435 --> 17:45.030
Oxycodone,
Buprenorphine, Secobarbital.

17:45.189 --> 17:48.534
How you plan on moving it?

17:48.693 --> 17:51.993
First we place false purchase orders
from shell medical companies

17:52.154 --> 17:54.452
so that everything's legit on paper.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.869
Then we will set up depots
like retail locations

17:58.035 --> 17:59.753
where customers can come
and get their fix.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.415
Fixed spots?

18:02.582 --> 18:05.961
Pill poppers and street junkies
are two different animals.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.095
Pills sell to high-end customers.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.053
You got to be mobile.
That's where your real bank is.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.138
What would you suggest?

18:13.301 --> 18:17.556
You need couriers who could
blend in to move into high-end places

18:17.722 --> 18:19.315
without getting spotted,

18:19.473 --> 18:23.148
and like magic,
your Oxy or whatever

18:23.311 --> 18:27.908
shows up right at your door
like a fucking pizza.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.528
I told Petar you would
show your worth.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.832
Yo, I can't talk right now.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.759
I got to take Ghost's kid
out to Basketball City, man.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.944
This nigga's got me out here
like a fucking nanny, man.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.212
I need to talk business.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.116
All right, well, little man on the way,
so I got to go.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.673
Tommy was with you all day?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.342
Yeah, yeah, he never left.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.806
Most men don't like spending time
with their mothers,

18:56.969 --> 18:58.846
but Tommy and I,
we're different.

19:00.765 --> 19:03.518
Tell me about that day.
What do you remember?

19:03.684 --> 19:05.061
Watch anything on TV?

19:05.227 --> 19:09.607
"Judge Judy," "Maury Povich."

19:09.774 --> 19:13.028
Tommy really likes “Dr. Phil."

19:13.194 --> 19:15.413
So if I find out
which episodes were on

19:15.571 --> 19:19.041
and I ask Tommy about them,
he'll remember?

19:19.200 --> 19:21.168
Sure.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.749
What did you eat for lunch?

19:22.912 --> 19:24.585
Pizza.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.250
- What was on the pizza?
- Pepperoni.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.794
- Where did you order it from?
- I don't remember.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.634
Was it delivery?
I can find out who came here.

19:32.797 --> 19:36.051
Tommy went to go pick it up.

19:36.217 --> 19:37.817
I thought you said
he didn't go anywhere.

19:37.842 --> 19:41.647
- You said he never left.
- I never left except to get the pizza.

19:41.806 --> 19:45.185
I was only gone, what,
20 minutes, Ma?

19:45.351 --> 19:46.819
Yeah, that's right, Tommy.

19:46.977 --> 19:50.902
You know, he was gone
such a short time, I didn't remember.

19:51.065 --> 19:53.113
Sit down, Angela.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.466
Bet you can't make
that shot right there.

20:02.576 --> 20:03.623
How much you want to bet?

20:03.786 --> 20:05.584
$10, right? Pay up.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.210
What's good, Dre?

20:10.376 --> 20:12.424
Ain't shit. What's up, man?

20:12.586 --> 20:13.906
Hey, let me see
what you got, man.

20:13.931 --> 20:16.091
- Make five in a row right there, a'ight?
- A'ight.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.634
You got a GPS on me
or something?

20:17.800 --> 20:20.474
Nah, nigga, I had other business
on this side of town.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.105
Just came through to see if
you all was still here.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.523
That's Ghost's son?

20:30.187 --> 20:31.564
What's his name?

20:33.357 --> 20:35.325
His name's Tariq, man.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.279
See that, Dre?
That's three in a row.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.619
Good shot.

20:40.781 --> 20:43.204
Tariq, who taught you
how to hoop?

20:43.367 --> 20:47.088
My friend Shawn used to help me out
until he... until he died.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.175
I'm a friend of Dre's.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.587
I used to know Shawn, too.
We used to play ball.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.756
My name's Slim.
You mind if we shoot a few?

20:56.922 --> 20:59.016
Yeah, sure.

21:02.136 --> 21:04.389
I know you and Jamie killed Lobos.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.523
His alibi checks out, but you?

21:06.682 --> 21:09.561
You need to get your story straight
with Kate, or we're all fucked.

21:09.727 --> 21:12.651
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I don't take orders from you.

21:12.813 --> 21:15.813
Listen, I don't like you either, but we're
all on the same fucking side now.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.864
Get your mother in line.

21:18.027 --> 21:21.201
It's too bad things didn't work out
between you and Holly.

21:21.363 --> 21:25.834
If she was still around,
you would have had an airtight alibi.

21:25.993 --> 21:30.089
We questioned that girl for 24 hours,
and she didn't say a fucking word.

21:31.832 --> 21:36.258
You ain't the inside guy, but you told
Ghost something, didn't you?

21:36.420 --> 21:40.516
Enough so now you scared
out your goddamn mind.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.927
It was dumb to come here, Angie.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.721
What if you were followed?

21:45.888 --> 21:49.142
Trust me, stay cool.

21:50.434 --> 21:53.529
If you don't, you and Ghost
gonna need his-and-her jumpsuits.

21:57.525 --> 21:59.744
How you shoot so good
with that glove on?

21:59.902 --> 22:01.404
Why you have it on, anyway?

22:03.531 --> 22:06.375
Why don't you go get me
and little man something to drink?

22:07.743 --> 22:09.370
Nah, we about to wrap up, man.

22:11.121 --> 22:13.374
Go get something for yourself, too.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.264
You play ball in school?

22:20.422 --> 22:22.766
No, we don't even have a team.

22:22.925 --> 22:25.553
What time you get out?
Maybe we can go play sometime.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.599
At, like, 3:00.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.268
I see you got the new Jordans.

22:32.434 --> 22:34.436
- You a sneaker head?
- Yeah.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.025
I used to be like that, too.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.708
I had them red IVs
when I was your age.

22:37.733 --> 22:38.649
Really? That's dope.

22:38.816 --> 22:40.113
- It was fire.
- Hey, look, man.

22:40.276 --> 22:41.653
We got to make a move on, a'ight?

22:41.819 --> 22:43.947
So, yeah, I got to take you
back to your pop's.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.115
Get your stuff, a'ight?

22:46.282 --> 22:47.579
All right. Good meeting you.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.209
Nice to meet you, too, 'Riq.

22:53.664 --> 22:56.793
Dre. Hit me up, man.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.768
Ghost, it's time for a meeting
with all the primeras

23:09.930 --> 23:11.477
to expand to the next level.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.438
I have something to do right now,

23:13.601 --> 23:15.721
but I'll do as you say
and arrange a time and a place.

23:15.746 --> 23:19.945
The time is now,
and as for the place...

23:20.107 --> 23:22.986
What the fuck?

23:34.413 --> 23:36.541
What the fuck's going on, man?

23:36.707 --> 23:38.300
And I get no fucking heads up?

23:38.459 --> 23:39.979
In the club, Tommy?
What the fuck, man?

23:40.004 --> 23:43.304
I couldn't make a move.
Fucking Igor was on me all day.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.531
Vibora.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.490
I didn't know you were back.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.906
- I'll grab another seat.
- No, I'll take this one.

24:08.072 --> 24:11.076
I will take a whiskey, though.
Now.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.622
I got to get back to my corners.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.212
We gonna get this shit started
or what?

24:19.375 --> 24:21.048
And I got a soup kitchen to open.

24:21.210 --> 24:24.931
The homeless don't like waiting,
Tommy, for food or drugs.

24:25.089 --> 24:26.181
What's the deal?

24:27.466 --> 24:29.264
All right, sit down.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.269
Go on, sit down,
sit down, sit down.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.351
Listen up, everybody.

24:33.514 --> 24:35.858
I got something special.

24:40.771 --> 24:42.773
You see this?

24:42.940 --> 24:46.035
This right here is the future.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.696
Now, we still gonna be
slanging dope same as always,

24:48.862 --> 24:51.536
but we also gonna be pushing pills,
and none of that fake shit

24:51.699 --> 24:54.623
from China that'll make you go
at a cop with retard strength.

24:54.785 --> 24:57.208
I'm talking name-brand,
quality shit,

24:57.371 --> 24:58.847
but you're all gonna be
paying for it up front.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.712
- Up front?
- What? That's never been the deal.

25:00.791 --> 25:01.838
We don't sell synthetics.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.201
Since when does the distro
tell me how to spend my money

25:04.336 --> 25:07.055
- on what product?
- Since right fucking now.

25:07.214 --> 25:09.433
I sell dope, not sleeping pills

25:09.591 --> 25:11.810
for soccer moms to suck down
with their chardonnay.

25:11.969 --> 25:14.267
I agree.

25:14.430 --> 25:17.434
I don't want to do this kind
of a business with you.

25:17.599 --> 25:20.022
I can't prove it,

25:20.185 --> 25:23.780
but I know you killed my son.

25:26.817 --> 25:28.444
Shit.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.030
Mother of God.

25:53.343 --> 25:55.345
All right.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.856
Well, an... anybody else
got a problem?

26:05.606 --> 26:06.653
Good.

26:06.815 --> 26:11.571
I'ma teach you how to get these
into every fucking corner in New York.

26:17.618 --> 26:19.791
Man, what the fuck was that?

26:19.953 --> 26:21.876
What's going on, Tommy?

26:22.039 --> 26:23.962
A primera meeting in Truth,

26:24.124 --> 26:26.004
and then he offs Shin
in the middle of the club?

26:26.043 --> 26:27.523
Well, you should be happy about that.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.709
He was pretty fucking angry
that you killed his kid.

26:29.797 --> 26:32.471
To save your fucking life.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.394
And then you're giving away
our whole system.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.920
You told him about the couriers and shit.
What up with that?

26:37.945 --> 26:41.567
Well, like you said,
we work for Milan... till we don't.

26:41.725 --> 26:44.399
You said toe the line,
and I'm in step.

26:46.230 --> 26:47.652
Oh, man.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.783
Would you fucking relax, man?

26:49.942 --> 26:52.536
Milan is testing you
to see how you gonna take it.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.241
Don't overreact.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.782
Come on, Ghost, think.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.745
Think.

27:00.911 --> 27:04.165
- All right, pull your shit together.
- Okay.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.378
Shit, you're right.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.009
And you better straighten out Ruiz

27:07.167 --> 27:09.448
'cause that mouthy motherfucker's
gonna get us all killed.

27:11.296 --> 27:14.175
- I'll get Ruiz on lock.
- Good.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.230
Much more and we're gonna need
a bigger safe soon.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.740
Probably should get one anyway.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.401
It's about that time, girl.
Trust me.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.208
Sorry, we're closed.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.244
Hi, Tasha.

27:42.411 --> 27:45.506
I hope I didn't scare you.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.541
No, I'm just surprised
to see you, that's all.

27:47.708 --> 27:51.133
Well, I'm sorry to show up unannounced,
but I could never plan things in advance.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.718
I'm just about to close up.

27:53.881 --> 27:56.976
Why don't we talk another time?
I could come to you.

27:57.134 --> 27:59.136
I am not dangerous to your friends.

27:59.303 --> 28:00.976
She does not know who I am,

28:01.138 --> 28:04.062
but she does not know
who you are either, right?

28:05.309 --> 28:09.155
No, she don't know shit,
and it's gonna stay that way.

28:11.481 --> 28:12.653
Da.

28:12.816 --> 28:17.413
So this is how Tommy
is cleaning his money.

28:17.571 --> 28:21.121
Genius. Most of the DEA is white.
If they're black, they're men.

28:21.283 --> 28:23.331
This place is not even
in their vocabulary.

28:24.203 --> 28:28.424
And your husband who was obviously
so honest with you about me.

28:28.582 --> 28:31.085
Are you so honest with him?

28:31.251 --> 28:32.844
Does he know
what you really do here?

28:33.003 --> 28:35.847
No, but he will
if you keep this up.

28:36.006 --> 28:39.510
White boy dancing into a weave shop
in the middle of the hood?

28:39.676 --> 28:43.021
You should go before somebody
starts asking questions.

28:45.766 --> 28:48.986
Tell your husband
to forget his plan to get rid of me

28:49.144 --> 28:51.988
or he will force my hand.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.820
Shit!

28:55.359 --> 28:56.406
Let me help you with that.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.286
No, no, I'm fine. I got it.

28:58.445 --> 29:01.244
- I got it. I'm fine.
- You okay?

29:01.406 --> 29:04.535
- Yes, thank you.
- Pleasure.

29:04.701 --> 29:07.204
So, yeah, were you looking
for directions or something?

29:07.371 --> 29:09.544
Oh, no, I work for Tasha's husband.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.208
You must be LaKeisha.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.127
- I am.
- I'm Dean.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.413
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you, too.

29:15.438 --> 29:17.597
Well, I have to get going.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.554
So I will talk to you later, Tasha?

29:19.716 --> 29:20.888
<i>Okay.</i>

29:21.051 --> 29:22.223
Good night.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.935
- Good night.
- Good night, Dean.

29:30.352 --> 29:31.649
That was nice of him.

29:31.812 --> 29:34.782
He just came by to see if we needed
extra security around here.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.659
Cut the bullshit, T.

29:37.818 --> 29:40.241
All this crap about
wholesaling hair and shit,

29:40.404 --> 29:42.202
you turning my shop
into a drug front?

29:42.364 --> 29:44.958
You were never supposed to know.

29:46.201 --> 29:49.455
Tasha, how could you
do this to me?

29:49.621 --> 29:51.999
I could lose everything
or go to jail.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.213
Who's gonna take care
of my son then?

29:55.919 --> 29:58.672
You know what?
Get your shit and get the fuck out.

29:58.839 --> 30:02.309
I can't, okay? I can't.

30:02.467 --> 30:05.220
If I stop working here now,
he'll know something's up, all right?

30:05.387 --> 30:07.856
The only way to protect you
is to stay.

30:08.015 --> 30:10.143
You got to promise me
you won't tell anybody.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.404
I don't have to promise you shit.

30:13.562 --> 30:15.735
Lock up behind me.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.070
Keisha.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.412
Make it quick.

30:26.575 --> 30:28.623
I know you believe
I was the leak.

30:32.706 --> 30:34.629
But I need you to know
I would never do anything

30:34.791 --> 30:38.170
to endanger anyone in
law enforcement, especially you.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.840
Too late, damage is done.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.343
I know you hate me,

30:44.509 --> 30:47.934
and I don't blame you,
but you have to believe me.

30:48.096 --> 30:49.939
It wasn't me.

30:50.098 --> 30:52.021
You know I want to win
too much for that.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.397
Then prove it.

30:57.564 --> 30:58.844
Prove to me you aren't the leak,

30:58.940 --> 31:01.140
or give me something
that can help me figure out who is.

31:01.165 --> 31:04.260
Until then, it's just a matter of time
until you're exposed.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.617
I really hope St. Patrick
was worth it.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.132
Fuck.

32:09.386 --> 32:12.560
You miss him?

32:12.722 --> 32:15.817
Hey, MJ. How can I help you?

32:15.976 --> 32:19.355
I stopped by Truth,
called on James St. Patrick.

32:19.521 --> 32:21.273
I actually get it now.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.943
I wonder what it was like to wake up
to him every morning.

32:27.362 --> 32:30.616
You know he was involved
with the Lobos murder...

32:31.908 --> 32:33.205
somehow.

32:33.368 --> 32:36.042
Now, I don't think he did
any of the dirty work,

32:36.204 --> 32:37.831
not with those
bespoke suits and all,

32:37.998 --> 32:40.968
but I bet he knows
who pulled the trigger.

32:41.126 --> 32:44.050
I don't know what he knows,
if he knows anything at all.

32:44.212 --> 32:45.930
You know this is
a death penalty case,

32:46.089 --> 32:48.683
and you know
a jury would eat you alive.

32:48.842 --> 32:51.846
A young, beautiful woman
sleeping with the enemy.

32:52.012 --> 32:54.856
But...

32:55.015 --> 32:57.234
if you wear a wire,

32:57.392 --> 32:59.486
get St. Patrick to talk,

32:59.644 --> 33:01.863
he and the shooter
would get prosecuted, not you.

33:02.022 --> 33:04.571
You think he would confess to me?

33:04.733 --> 33:05.734
Why?

33:05.901 --> 33:08.495
I saw his face
when I said your name.

33:08.653 --> 33:12.829
I think he'd probably confess
just to get back up that pencil skirt,

33:12.991 --> 33:15.039
and you could get a walk.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.673
That's bullshit, and you know it.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.929
If you had evidence,
the Lobos shooters

33:26.087 --> 33:28.260
would be flipped on me,
not the other way around.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.300
I'd get lethal injection
because I took a vow

33:30.467 --> 33:32.390
to serve and protect.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.725
I'm not your leak, MJ.

33:34.888 --> 33:37.482
I don't know anything
about St. Patrick's involvement,

33:37.641 --> 33:41.191
but trust me,
if I could prove he was guilty,

33:41.353 --> 33:44.106
I'd serve him up to you
on a goddamn platter.

33:44.272 --> 33:48.448
I hope you survive this,
AUSA Valdes.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.363
I'll be rooting for you.

33:56.117 --> 33:57.710
Ghost.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.542
Ghost!

33:59.704 --> 34:00.876
I know you hear me. Wake up.

34:02.332 --> 34:03.458
What the fuck, Tash?

34:03.625 --> 34:05.548
Kids saw you come home
drunk last night

34:05.710 --> 34:07.390
when you were supposed
to be watching them.

34:07.415 --> 34:09.385
I mean, what the fuck
are you thinking, Ghost?

34:09.547 --> 34:12.051
You got to have your mind right,
especially now.

34:13.927 --> 34:16.179
I haven't seen you like this in years.

34:16.346 --> 34:19.350
I went to a bar last night
to do some research.

34:19.516 --> 34:21.735
I'm in control, Tasha.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.565
I'm gonna get us out
from under Milan.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.150
I got a plan.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.288
Maybe we shouldn't be planning
something against him.

34:33.446 --> 34:36.199
Maybe with Milan, doing nothing
is the right thing to do,

34:36.366 --> 34:38.485
- keep us all safe.
- You got to trust me, Tash, okay?

34:38.511 --> 34:39.995
You have to trust me.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.481
That's why I went out last night.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.965
I need more information
before I can make a move.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.085
I'm gonna shower.

34:59.014 --> 35:01.767
Tommy, Ghost is plotting
something against Milan,

35:01.933 --> 35:04.732
and he's fucking drinking again.
Call me back.

35:10.400 --> 35:14.701
- Are you hungry?
- No, thank you.

35:17.449 --> 35:22.330
So tell me how Ghost reacted
to the meeting at Truth.

35:22.495 --> 35:27.217
He wasn't happy about it,
but I got him to come 'round.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.921
You see how the tables have turned?

35:31.087 --> 35:33.135
How he needs you now?

35:35.133 --> 35:38.103
I can tell from watching you
that it used to be the other way.

35:38.261 --> 35:40.059
Well, a lot of things done changed.

35:40.221 --> 35:42.440
And yet some have not.

35:44.351 --> 35:48.322
You're still uncle to his children,
brother to his wife.

35:48.480 --> 35:52.110
I went to see Tasha to see if Ghost
had told her about me.

35:52.275 --> 35:55.745
He told her everything.

35:58.698 --> 36:02.874
She was afraid,
but more for her friend than herself.

36:03.036 --> 36:05.789
- What friend?
- LaKeisha, pretty girl.

36:05.955 --> 36:07.081
Yeah.

36:07.248 --> 36:11.845
All of you so connected,

36:12.003 --> 36:14.051
but all it causes is pain.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.343
What would your life be like,
Tommy,

36:18.510 --> 36:20.933
if you had no friends,

36:21.096 --> 36:23.565
if you were completely free?

36:25.767 --> 36:28.361
- I am free.
- Are you?

36:28.520 --> 36:31.865
Or are you still loyal to a man
who is not loyal to you?

36:32.023 --> 36:34.822
Right now,

36:34.984 --> 36:37.282
I bet Ghost is plotting against me

36:37.445 --> 36:39.325
even though he knows
I will kill the both of you

36:39.406 --> 36:41.033
if he tries to make a move.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.540
He didn't tell me nothing
about no plans.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.876
Would he? You know the man.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.382
Would he tell you
before he made a move?

36:51.459 --> 36:55.054
I see potential in you,
my friend.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.183
You could replace me.

37:01.511 --> 37:05.061
But you cannot get there as long
as you are anchored to Ghost,

37:05.223 --> 37:09.069
a man you cannot trust.

37:11.521 --> 37:13.774
Why we working for the Serbian
motherfucker?

37:13.940 --> 37:15.613
Why'd you send me away?

37:15.775 --> 37:17.493
So you could kill Lobos?

37:17.652 --> 37:19.825
I don't know if I can trust you.

37:22.615 --> 37:25.164
Listen, Ruiz, I know you were
talking to the Feds,

37:25.326 --> 37:27.046
and I know that you
almost gave them my name

37:27.078 --> 37:29.046
even after I saved your life.

37:29.205 --> 37:32.175
The Puerto Rican girl,
the AUSA, she works for you.

37:32.333 --> 37:33.334
Not a good look for you.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.838
You turning snitch on me
does not end well for you.

37:37.881 --> 37:40.430
But I'll tell you how
you can make it up to me.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.515
You go give them another story.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.395
I'm done fucking with the Feds.

37:44.554 --> 37:46.147
No, you aren't.
You go back to the Feds.

37:46.306 --> 37:49.185
You tell them you'll help them,
but instead of snitching on me,

37:49.350 --> 37:52.194
you give them a bigger fish,
our new boss, Milan.

37:52.353 --> 37:54.026
I'm not snitching on that guy.

37:54.189 --> 37:57.443
If the Feds put Milan away
or deport his ass back to hell...

37:58.735 --> 38:02.205
I'm out. I bow out as distro.

38:02.363 --> 38:06.334
You get a new connect,
and you become distro.

38:07.994 --> 38:11.123
You back in the game, baby,
with an upgrade.

38:15.543 --> 38:18.342
Yo, Tariq.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.678
How you doing?

38:20.840 --> 38:23.684
Hey, I'ma check y'all later.

38:23.843 --> 38:26.187
I was in the hood, thought
I'd roll through, see what's up.

38:26.346 --> 38:28.314
You want to get something to eat?

38:28.473 --> 38:30.191
I don't know.
I got to wait for Dre.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.858
You got to wait for your babysitter?
I hear that.

38:46.074 --> 38:47.121
♪ I be getting paper... ♪

38:47.283 --> 38:48.580
You want some?

38:50.620 --> 38:53.089
You should try it if you want,
get your buzz on.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.250
Unless Dre coming
with your sippy cup.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.390
You'll get used to it.

39:02.549 --> 39:05.268
All the good shit hurts
the first time around.

39:07.595 --> 39:10.599
Donato, you said you got
something for me? Shoot.

39:10.765 --> 39:13.518
Yeah,
a little coincidence popped up.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.188
Four of the places we busted
for selling these cigarettes

39:16.354 --> 39:18.527
in the last year are owned
by the same company,

39:18.690 --> 39:21.910
a bread company of all things,
Stuben Bread.

39:22.068 --> 39:23.911
You know anything about them?

39:24.070 --> 39:26.368
Yeah, I think maybe I do.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.750
Send me the names
of the Stuben places immediately.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.125
Yeah, will do.

39:30.285 --> 39:31.707
Look, James,

39:31.870 --> 39:33.497
is this about the attempt on your life?

39:34.831 --> 39:36.991
Because you could just tell me
what you're looking for.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.763
I'm looking
to get you promoted, all right?

39:38.788 --> 39:41.547
So if this works out for you,
I'll be in contact about that bust.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.511
Okay.

39:46.593 --> 39:49.267
So?

39:49.429 --> 39:50.931
So I checked Ruiz's ass, all right?

39:51.097 --> 39:52.815
- Oh, yeah.
- No more problems from him.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.317
- That's over.
- Good,

39:54.475 --> 39:57.194
'cause I heard Milan
likes white meat.

39:57.353 --> 39:59.572
I don't want to be on his menu.

39:59.731 --> 40:03.577
Ghost.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.829
What up?

40:05.987 --> 40:09.537
If you're working on some plan to get out,
you better fucking tell me.

40:09.699 --> 40:11.292
This can't be like it was before,

40:11.451 --> 40:13.374
where you zig without
telling me to fucking zag.

40:13.536 --> 40:15.914
Nope, I got no plan, man.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.125
I don't know enough
about the cat, you know?

40:19.292 --> 40:20.635
I don't know his story.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.913
Most importantly, I don't know
his fucking weak spots,

40:22.938 --> 40:24.677
don't know where
his headquarters are.

40:24.839 --> 40:26.519
I mean, can you tell me
where he hangs out?

40:26.544 --> 40:27.638
You got any idea?

40:27.800 --> 40:30.599
Nah, I'm just as much
in the dark as you.

40:33.556 --> 40:35.229
So I guess we just
stay the course.

40:35.391 --> 40:37.234
Right, Ghost.

40:40.730 --> 40:42.778
So this is where
you and my dad grew up?

40:42.941 --> 40:44.864
Yup.

40:45.026 --> 40:47.074
He told me not to come here,
to stay away.

40:47.236 --> 40:49.705
Fuck that, nigga needs to know
where he come from.

40:49.864 --> 40:53.494
I started out hustling these streets
after school when I was 11.

40:53.660 --> 40:57.335
We started out selling
Fat Alberts to my uncles.

40:57.497 --> 41:00.046
Fat Alberts? What's that?

41:00.208 --> 41:02.802
That's 1/4 gram of coke
wrapped in foil.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.384
Back in the day
they went 25 a pop.

41:06.673 --> 41:08.391
How'd you meet my dad?

41:09.384 --> 41:11.136
He was in the game with me, kid.

41:11.302 --> 41:14.146
He a D-boy from way back.
He ain't just move the shit.

41:14.305 --> 41:17.479
He was one of the baddest
motherfuckers on the block.

41:17.642 --> 41:19.895
He don't seem that way now.

41:20.061 --> 41:22.940
You want to see some proof?

41:35.743 --> 41:37.620
So you're not speaking to me now?

41:37.787 --> 41:40.336
I ain't got nothing to say.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.715
Fine.

41:44.877 --> 41:46.971
Then don't talk, just listen.

41:49.215 --> 41:51.013
I don't want you to get hurt, Keisha,

41:51.175 --> 41:52.768
and I don't know
how much time we have,

41:52.927 --> 41:54.349
so you got to take this bag.

41:54.512 --> 41:57.106
To shut me up, right?

41:57.265 --> 41:58.517
Well, how much?

41:58.683 --> 42:01.436
Almost 500 Gs.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.570
You take this,
you look the other way.

42:05.732 --> 42:09.908
You help me to prove to the people
I work for that you can be trusted.

42:10.069 --> 42:11.662
Keisha, I'm trying to save your life.

42:11.821 --> 42:13.823
Are you?

42:13.990 --> 42:15.710
What you gonna do
if I don't take the money?

42:15.825 --> 42:18.453
What you gonna do if you don't?

42:18.619 --> 42:20.059
You ain't gonna make it to the cops.

42:20.163 --> 42:21.710
I ain't going to no cops.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.250
I'm no fucking snitch.

42:23.416 --> 42:27.011
Then take the bag, Keisha.

42:27.170 --> 42:29.798
Please.

42:37.764 --> 42:39.391
I'll see you here tomorrow.

42:45.313 --> 42:48.738
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I am, too.

43:35.154 --> 43:37.577
You've got to be kidding me.

43:40.284 --> 43:42.582
I knew you would
pull something like this.

43:42.745 --> 43:44.543
This was not the plan, Jamie.

43:44.705 --> 43:47.145
You said you had something.
You drop the evidence off at 8:00.

43:47.208 --> 43:49.302
I pick it up at 9:00.
That was the deal.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.508
What's going on between
you and Greg Knox?

43:51.671 --> 43:54.800
No, no, no, you do not
get to ask me that question.

43:54.966 --> 43:58.061
We are not friends.
We are not lovers.

43:58.219 --> 44:01.519
We are just two people who have
to work together to stay out of jail.

44:05.268 --> 44:06.941
Here, Angie.

44:07.103 --> 44:09.401
- What's this?
- It belongs to Lobos's guy, okay?

44:09.564 --> 44:13.239
Whoever the leak is at your office
was calling him on that phone.

44:13.401 --> 44:15.369
I figured you could trace
the number or texts.

44:15.528 --> 44:17.088
Where is Lobos's guy?
Can I talk to him?

44:17.113 --> 44:18.281
Can't tell you that.

44:18.447 --> 44:20.290
How did you get this?

44:20.449 --> 44:23.919
- I can't tell you, Angela.
- You don't trust me.

44:24.078 --> 44:26.331
Makes two of us,
'cause you don't trust me.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.340
Where were you
the day Lobos was killed?

44:30.501 --> 44:32.219
Karen's hotel, like I said.

44:32.378 --> 44:34.301
Can anyone corroborate that?

44:36.674 --> 44:39.314
Tasha, but you already know that
because you already talked to her.

44:39.339 --> 44:40.603
She said you slept together.

44:40.761 --> 44:42.479
- Is that true?
- Come on.

44:42.638 --> 44:44.936
The day after you fucked me
on my dining room table,

44:45.099 --> 44:46.692
you took your wife away
to reconcile?

44:49.395 --> 44:52.649
We spent the night in the room,
and I spent the night on the couch.

44:52.815 --> 44:53.816
Are you happy?

44:53.941 --> 44:56.569
You two should get
your stories straight.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.697
God, I'm such a fucking idiot.

44:59.864 --> 45:02.208
- Angie, stop.
- At least we're both innocent.

45:02.366 --> 45:05.290
- Angela, stop, okay? Listen...
- Just get out.

45:10.082 --> 45:13.211
Get out.

45:50.831 --> 45:52.333
Have a seat.

45:56.545 --> 45:58.718
A friend of mine, Breeze,
used to live here.

46:00.675 --> 46:02.723
What happened to him?

46:02.885 --> 46:04.728
He got shot in this room.

46:04.887 --> 46:08.733
Your father and I
used to work for Breeze.

46:08.891 --> 46:10.893
We was tough little niggas like you.

46:12.353 --> 46:15.072
Breeze was strong,
but he wasn't smart,

46:15.231 --> 46:17.359
had the same routine every day.

46:17.525 --> 46:20.620
We always know
where that motherfucker at.

46:20.778 --> 46:22.530
One day your father said to me...

46:22.697 --> 46:23.744
Hold on.

46:24.949 --> 46:26.951
It's my mom. She looking for me.

46:27.118 --> 46:29.120
Tell her you'll be home in a hour.

46:29.287 --> 46:32.962
All right.

46:38.254 --> 46:40.382
So what was you
saying about my dad?

46:40.548 --> 46:42.892
Your pops knew

46:43.050 --> 46:45.599
that Breeze'd be here
at 7:00 to watch "Jeopardy!"

46:45.761 --> 46:48.059
Nigga loved Alex Trebek.

46:48.222 --> 46:50.691
So Ghost came up after school,

46:50.850 --> 46:53.774
we broke in, and we waited for him
to come home and watch TV.

46:53.936 --> 46:55.938
So... to scare him?

46:56.105 --> 46:59.655
Breeze didn't have time
to get scared.

47:10.536 --> 47:12.630
Man, I fucking hate my dad.

47:15.374 --> 47:17.422
I thought you looked up
to that motherfucker.

47:17.585 --> 47:18.928
Thought y'all was tight.

47:19.086 --> 47:20.804
He always trying to
give me rules on, like,

47:20.963 --> 47:23.967
how to act and what men do,

47:24.133 --> 47:25.976
but he's a fucking liar.

47:26.135 --> 47:29.890
Like, he cheated on my mom,
then he moved out,

47:30.056 --> 47:33.777
and then he just
turned his back on us.

47:38.272 --> 47:40.195
He turned his back on me, too.

47:48.949 --> 47:51.168
You want to get him back?

47:51.327 --> 47:53.546
Yeah, I wish I could.

47:53.704 --> 47:58.005
If all the things you're telling me
about who he was was real...

47:58.167 --> 47:59.714
It's true.

48:01.670 --> 48:05.015
Then everything he told me
about himself was just a lie.

48:05.174 --> 48:07.472
I can't even trust him no more.

48:11.055 --> 48:12.898
You can trust me, little man.

48:14.433 --> 48:17.403
You can trust me.

48:24.193 --> 48:27.868
- Yes, sir?
- Can I get a scotch double?

48:30.574 --> 48:32.827
Never seen you in here before.

48:32.993 --> 48:35.667
Well, it's nice to be seen
for the first time.

48:35.830 --> 48:38.629
- What's your name?
- My name is Bill.

48:38.791 --> 48:40.714
Pleasure to meet you, Bill.

48:40.876 --> 48:43.800
Nice to meet you.

48:50.845 --> 48:52.688
- One of those days?
- Yeah.

48:52.847 --> 48:54.927
Seems like one of those days
every day now, you know?

48:54.952 --> 48:57.046
It's like the more I fight,
the deeper I get.

49:02.815 --> 49:04.975
Sir, what do you say
I'd get a pack of those cigarettes

49:05.025 --> 49:06.368
right there, the Drina?

49:51.238 --> 49:53.991
You're never gonna stop
pursuing me,

49:54.158 --> 49:55.876
thinking I'm the leak,

49:56.035 --> 49:58.584
even without proof
I've done anything wrong.

49:58.746 --> 50:01.545
I'll get it soon.

50:09.006 --> 50:13.102
I figured out St. Patrick's motive
for the Lobos murder,

50:13.260 --> 50:16.264
so whoever helped him
and Egan kill Lobos

50:16.430 --> 50:17.932
is gonna be outed and prosecuted.

50:18.098 --> 50:19.941
I'd get yourself a lawyer, Angela.

50:20.100 --> 50:23.274
I am a lawyer, Greg.

50:23.437 --> 50:25.781
I've been investigating Jamie, too.

50:25.940 --> 50:28.864
You said you wanted proof?

50:30.986 --> 50:32.909
Look at this.

50:35.449 --> 50:38.328
The day of the transport,

50:38.494 --> 50:40.371
he was at the Odette Hotel.

50:41.580 --> 50:44.834
See the date?

50:45.000 --> 50:46.502
You know,
this shows him entering.

50:46.669 --> 50:48.967
Doesn't mean he couldn't
bail later to do Lobos.

50:49.129 --> 50:51.097
I called the hotel.

50:51.257 --> 50:54.306
His car was with the valet overnight.
He left the next day.

50:54.468 --> 50:56.548
Could have slipped out a side door,
had a backup car.

50:57.721 --> 51:01.442
Any witnesses verify
that he was actually at the hotel

51:01.600 --> 51:03.443
at the time of the murder, Angela?

51:07.022 --> 51:09.195
Watch this.

51:15.739 --> 51:19.710
His wife, Tasha, was with him.

51:24.748 --> 51:26.716
I was sure he killed Lobos.

51:29.044 --> 51:31.968
I thought I would feel better
if I could just put him in jail.

51:32.131 --> 51:35.101
I went looking,
but I found this.

51:37.261 --> 51:39.013
I told you I'm not the leak.

51:39.179 --> 51:40.681
Do you believe me now?

51:45.519 --> 51:47.988
You can say you told me so.

51:53.068 --> 51:55.287
No, I'm not gonna say that.

52:13.547 --> 52:14.844
I should go.

52:19.428 --> 52:20.930
Yeah.

52:22.514 --> 52:24.141
It's true what I said.

52:24.308 --> 52:28.654
It's a really bad neighborhood.

52:31.273 --> 52:33.776
I could walk you
to your car at least.

52:41.617 --> 52:44.040
I'm..

52:44.203 --> 52:48.458
I'm just... so cold.

53:02.137 --> 53:04.686
I still love her.

53:05.933 --> 53:07.185
You know?

53:07.351 --> 53:10.321
I mean, I really love her.

53:17.403 --> 53:20.156
Yo, man, I hate to tell you this
but I got to close up shop.

53:20.322 --> 53:22.074
