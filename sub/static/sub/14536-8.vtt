WEBVTT

00:04.863 --> 00:06.479
You're really smart, Ernie,
and so funny.

00:06.515 --> 00:09.683
I never thought I'd have this much
fun working on a physics project.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.684
Ooh, Ernie's on fire.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.137
If you liked working with me,

00:13.172 --> 00:15.847
next time, you should
partner up with Danny Haifetz.

00:15.882 --> 00:18.202
He's really smart and funny.

00:19.636 --> 00:22.570
And he's been extinguished.

00:22.606 --> 00:25.023
So if you wanna
talk about the project,

00:25.058 --> 00:27.717
or you just wanna talk,
about anything,

00:27.752 --> 00:30.103
any time, call me.

00:30.138 --> 00:32.218
That's okay.
I'll just see you at school.

00:35.777 --> 00:38.611
Boy, what is wrong with you?

00:38.647 --> 00:41.681
I have flat feet, astigmatism,

00:41.716 --> 00:43.349
and I lack definition
in my calves.

00:43.385 --> 00:46.219
And in your brain.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.255
You cannot see that Akina
was flirting with you?

00:48.290 --> 00:51.550
I wish my cell signal
was that strong.

00:51.585 --> 00:54.995
KC, I know you're
an expert on dating

00:55.030 --> 00:57.614
because you've had
one boyfriend,

00:57.650 --> 01:00.342
for five minutes,

01:00.377 --> 01:03.945
but a girl that cute would
never be interested in me.

01:03.981 --> 01:08.116
Because you have
no self-confidence, bro.

01:08.152 --> 01:10.360
Ugh. That boy's
got a real problem.

01:10.395 --> 01:13.972
You right. You won't find
his calves in a dictionary,

01:14.007 --> 01:16.241
because they've got
no definition.

01:16.276 --> 01:18.835
I'm talking about
his lack of self-esteem.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.078
I don't know where
he gets that from.

01:20.113 --> 01:22.013
Please. That boy
is a lost cause.

01:22.049 --> 01:24.116
And mystery solved.

01:26.921 --> 01:29.963
I need to do something
to build him up.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.406
You don't have time.
You got the Monroe mission,

01:31.441 --> 01:32.866
and you're running point.

01:32.901 --> 01:36.160
Wait, Dad, here's an idea.

01:36.196 --> 01:37.771
What if I let Ernie
think that he's in charge

01:37.806 --> 01:39.631
of the Monroe mission?

01:39.667 --> 01:41.341
Then that'll help
his confidence.

01:41.376 --> 01:45.028
So you actually wanna let
Ernie think he's in charge

01:45.064 --> 01:46.846
to make him feel
better about himself?

01:46.881 --> 01:48.557
Well, yeah. It works
when Mom does it to you.

01:48.592 --> 01:50.642
Hey!

01:50.677 --> 01:52.035
Yeah, it does.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.337
( laughs )

01:54.372 --> 01:57.966
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

01:58.001 --> 02:01.078
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

02:01.080 --> 02:04.081
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

02:04.116 --> 02:09.218
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

02:09.254 --> 02:12.881
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

02:12.916 --> 02:14.974
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

02:15.010 --> 02:19.045
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

02:19.080 --> 02:22.982
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

02:23.018 --> 02:25.051
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

02:25.086 --> 02:27.329
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

02:27.364 --> 02:29.514
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

02:29.550 --> 02:31.625
¶ But I always got your back ¶

02:31.660 --> 02:33.552
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

02:33.587 --> 02:35.754
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

02:35.789 --> 02:38.390
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

02:38.425 --> 02:39.741
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

02:39.776 --> 02:41.893
I keep it undercover.

02:41.928 --> 02:43.528
I keep it undercover.

02:47.217 --> 02:49.292
Bro, I know you're gonna
do absolutely great

02:49.327 --> 02:50.944
leading this mission.

02:50.979 --> 02:52.204
It should be pretty easy though.

02:52.239 --> 02:54.814
All we gotta do is break into
Nelson Monroe's condo,

02:54.850 --> 02:57.959
get the SD card containing all the
crucial information, and then get out.

02:57.995 --> 03:01.137
That is the standard procedure.

03:01.172 --> 03:03.006
But where's the pizzazz?

03:03.041 --> 03:04.741
The creativity?

03:04.777 --> 03:06.718
The... wow factor?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.198
Ernie, is that a...

03:12.234 --> 03:15.159
Handmade scale model
of Monroe's condo,

03:15.195 --> 03:16.770
built entirely with
Popsicle sticks?

03:16.805 --> 03:19.189
Yes. Yes, it is.

03:20.909 --> 03:25.236
Now, while I'm here,

03:25.271 --> 03:28.464
you'll be across the street
on the roof

03:28.500 --> 03:30.350
of the next building.
When I give the signal,

03:30.385 --> 03:32.944
you'll get into
the waiting helicopter

03:32.980 --> 03:34.947
and then parachute over
to this building here.

03:34.982 --> 03:37.223
See, I love... love, love, love,

03:37.259 --> 03:37.924
the direction you're
going with this.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.552
I really do.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.471
But maybe I could just offer
a little itty-bitty

03:43.506 --> 03:45.898
bit of feedback. Maybe we should

03:45.934 --> 03:48.844
keep the mission simple,
and on budget,

03:48.879 --> 03:50.770
and in reality.

03:50.806 --> 03:54.307
KC, KC, KC.

03:54.342 --> 03:57.218
Small-minded,
can't-think-out-of-the-box KC.

03:57.254 --> 04:01.281
No wonder the Organization
wanted me to lead this mission.

04:01.316 --> 04:03.257
You're past your prime.

04:03.293 --> 04:05.318
Outdated. Off fleek.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.957
Clearly, they want
some fresh blood.

04:09.959 --> 04:12.967
Yeah, you're right.
They want some fresh blood.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.123
And if you don't chill,
they're gonna get some.

04:21.895 --> 04:23.679
And that's the great tour.
You got everything?

04:23.714 --> 04:26.664
That's the section where
people drop off donations,

04:26.700 --> 04:28.525
that's where we categorize
and sort things,

04:28.560 --> 04:32.278
and over here is the section
where we prepare food parcels

04:32.314 --> 04:34.397
- for pick-up or delivery.
- Perfect.

04:34.432 --> 04:35.498
Which section would you
like to work in?

04:35.533 --> 04:37.583
Inventory. I hate to brag,

04:37.619 --> 04:40.270
but I probably have one of the
best organized closets in town.

04:40.305 --> 04:42.747
I could arrange the food
by color, season,

04:42.782 --> 04:44.875
or style.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.568
You're cool, Marisa.

04:46.603 --> 04:48.003
I'm really glad you decided
to volunteer.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.537
You're a lot of fun.

04:49.572 --> 04:51.706
Really? If you weren't my boss,

04:51.741 --> 04:53.174
I'd think you were
about to ask me out.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.819
We're volunteers;
I'm not your boss.

04:55.854 --> 04:57.462
In that case, I'm free any time.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.881
- I'm thinking tomorrow.
- I'm thinking I'm there.

04:59.916 --> 05:02.909
Cool. Well, my shift's up.
I better go.

05:02.944 --> 05:04.544
I'm just gonna
grab one of these.

05:08.658 --> 05:10.750
Is that allowed?

05:10.786 --> 05:13.377
I'm not usually
a huge stickler on rules.

05:13.413 --> 05:15.363
In fact, I wasn't
allowed at school today

05:15.399 --> 05:17.816
because I broke
about five of them,

05:17.818 --> 05:21.653
but isn't that for the
( whispers ) less fortunate?

05:21.688 --> 05:25.240
Yeah, it is.
I'm not just a volunteer.

05:26.752 --> 05:28.910
I'm also one of the
( whispers ) less fortYou are?

05:28.945 --> 05:31.630
You are. Congrats.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.323
I mean, that's cool.

05:33.358 --> 05:35.083
( Stammering )

05:35.118 --> 05:36.100
Not cool. I meant to say...

05:36.136 --> 05:38.211
It's okay, Marisa.

05:38.246 --> 05:39.766
My family's had
a tough time this year,

05:39.798 --> 05:42.707
but we're digging our way out, and
the food bank's really helped.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.626
That's why I volunteer.
I wanna give back.

05:44.661 --> 05:47.195
Good to know.

05:47.230 --> 05:50.123
Not that it matters.
Why would it?

05:50.158 --> 05:51.850
Who cares? Doesn't matter to me.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.953
I mean, it doesn't
<i>not</i> matter to me.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.480
I do care. I'm a human
being not a monster.

05:57.515 --> 05:59.432
Okay, see ya tomorrow.

06:06.374 --> 06:08.266
First, we'll take a bus
to Roanoke.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.092
Smart move, son.

06:10.128 --> 06:13.145
Yeah. Very smart.

06:13.181 --> 06:17.358
Except, um, the mission
is in downtown D.C.,

06:17.394 --> 06:20.645
so why would we go
all the way to Roanoke?

06:20.680 --> 06:22.413
That's what our enemies
will be asking

06:22.449 --> 06:24.674
if they try to follow us.

06:24.709 --> 06:27.029
I like where your head's at.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.130
So, we'll take a bus to Roanoke,

06:31.166 --> 06:33.207
cab it over to the metro,

06:33.243 --> 06:34.801
we go three stops,
and then start walking back.

06:34.836 --> 06:37.320
Very inventive.

06:37.356 --> 06:40.540
Yes, and the award for
most inventive,

06:40.575 --> 06:43.477
yet completely unnecessary
effort goes to...

06:43.512 --> 06:45.311
Ernie Cooper.

06:47.950 --> 06:51.501
KC, you've been challenging
every decision I make.

06:51.537 --> 06:54.329
You leave me no choice
but to put you in my report.

06:54.364 --> 06:57.957
Ernie's log,
regarding KC Cooper.

06:57.992 --> 07:01.628
Insubordination, bad attitude,

07:01.663 --> 07:04.664
unwillingness to parachute
out of a moving helicopter.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.900
Tell it like it is, son.

07:10.054 --> 07:15.041
Really? The kid's 15, and now
you decide to encourage him?

07:15.076 --> 07:16.559
It was your idea
to build him up.

07:16.594 --> 07:18.211
I was just going along with it.

07:18.246 --> 07:20.797
But if we're being honest,

07:20.832 --> 07:23.407
Craig's log,
regarding KC Cooper.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.163
I knew this was a bad idea.

07:32.344 --> 07:34.352
Hey, Ernie,
did you get the SD card?

07:34.387 --> 07:37.038
Yes. Yes, I did.

07:37.073 --> 07:39.340
Mission accomplished.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.209
You may now congratulate me.

07:41.244 --> 07:43.369
Okay. You know what? Good work.

07:43.404 --> 07:45.888
I have to admit that
I was a little skeptical

07:45.923 --> 07:48.909
when the Organization put you
in charge of the mission,

07:48.944 --> 07:50.493
but you definitely
proved yourself.

07:50.528 --> 07:52.754
Yes. Yes, I did.

07:54.733 --> 07:58.051
Now we just have to sneak
into the air conditioning ducts,

07:58.086 --> 08:00.136
grab the rappelling gear
I hid in there,

08:00.171 --> 08:02.021
belly crawl three floors
up to the roof,

08:02.056 --> 08:03.681
rappel down, commandeer a car,

08:03.717 --> 08:06.197
and hightail it back to Roanoke.

08:06.970 --> 08:09.245
Or...

08:09.281 --> 08:12.432
maybe we could use the elevator

08:12.467 --> 08:15.577
that's right here.

08:15.612 --> 08:17.662
- Ernie, give me the card.
- I got it.

08:17.697 --> 08:19.005
Ernie, give me the card.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.541
( Gasps )

08:21.543 --> 08:24.152
I think someone has forgotten
that I am up here,

08:24.187 --> 08:27.122
and you are... ( clicks tongue )

08:27.157 --> 08:30.108
way down here.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.784
So when I say jump,
you say how high.

08:31.819 --> 08:33.370
Jump.

08:33.405 --> 08:35.547
- How high?
- Hey, give that back!

08:35.582 --> 08:37.715
( Both arguing )

08:53.158 --> 08:55.558
Well, look at that.

08:55.593 --> 08:58.110
Thanks to you,
now the SD card is...

08:58.146 --> 09:00.697
( clicks tongue )
way down there.

09:10.917 --> 09:12.216
Well, did you find the card?

09:12.252 --> 09:14.076
Yes, Ernie.

09:14.112 --> 09:17.213
I just enjoy sticking my head
inside of a trash chute

09:17.249 --> 09:20.550
because it smells so delightful.

09:20.585 --> 09:22.585
It just doesn't get
any better than this.

09:23.513 --> 09:25.353
( Trash clattering in chute )

09:30.095 --> 09:32.203
Look at that.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.238
It just got better.

09:35.358 --> 09:37.566
KC, we're on a mission.

09:37.602 --> 09:40.094
Snack on your time, not mine.

09:40.129 --> 09:43.206
Now, I'm guessing that
this trash chute goes

09:43.241 --> 09:45.608
all the way down
to the dumpster.

09:45.644 --> 09:47.669
Really? So the trash
doesn't just magically

09:47.704 --> 09:50.705
defy the laws of gravity
and float up to the roof?

09:53.376 --> 09:56.344
Ernie's log,
regarding guess who.

09:56.379 --> 09:58.538
Snarky, snarky, snarky.

09:58.573 --> 10:00.673
I don't even know why I...

10:02.152 --> 10:04.084
Instead of arguing,

10:04.120 --> 10:05.711
- let's just go down to the...
- Dumpster!

10:05.747 --> 10:08.914
And find the card. I said it
first, so it was my idea!

10:08.950 --> 10:11.050
Okay...

10:11.085 --> 10:12.993
Boss.

10:13.029 --> 10:16.122
- ( Cell phone rings )
- Hi, Marisa.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.257
You keep your phone on
during missions?

10:18.292 --> 10:21.594
Tsk tsk tsk. Ernie's log.

10:21.630 --> 10:24.780
Hey, Marisa, I'm kinda in the
middle of something, so what's up?

10:24.815 --> 10:26.874
There's this guy
I volunteer with, Adam,

10:26.909 --> 10:28.660
and he's really, really cute.

10:28.695 --> 10:30.870
Marisa, quickly.

10:30.905 --> 10:33.173
Okay, so this volunteer
guy asked me out,

10:33.175 --> 10:38.236
and that's great,
but he doesn't just work here.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.905
He alsoThat makes me feel good
his familyon one hand,

10:40.940 --> 10:43.482
because they need it,
but bad on the other,

10:43.518 --> 10:45.376
because they need it
and, I don't know.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.920
It's like I have no idea
what that's like.

10:47.955 --> 10:50.148
Is he nice to you?

10:50.183 --> 10:51.858
- Yeah.
- Is he cute?

10:51.893 --> 10:54.652
- Oh, yeah.
- Ugh, he sounds horrible.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.162
If I were you, I would
run away from him

10:56.197 --> 10:58.756
as fast as possible.

10:58.791 --> 11:00.608
So you're saying
it doesn't matter.

11:00.644 --> 11:01.924
I'm saying listen to your heart.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.780
Not literally, Marisa.

11:07.659 --> 11:08.991
I knew that.

11:14.457 --> 11:17.625
Great. It's empty, just like
the one in the basement.

11:17.660 --> 11:19.660
Oh, no, actually, there's
a family of rats in here.

11:19.687 --> 11:22.687
- ( Rats squeaking ) - There's
a family of rats in here!

11:24.550 --> 11:26.609
Where's all the garbage?

11:26.645 --> 11:30.396
I'm guessing in
that garbage truck.

11:30.431 --> 11:32.023
Great, along with the SD card.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.566
We have to follow that truck.

11:33.601 --> 11:35.526
Really? Just follow it,

11:35.562 --> 11:40.031
because that seems like it's
missing a little... wow factor.

11:40.066 --> 11:42.266
Maybe we should, I don't know,

11:42.301 --> 11:44.902
take a flight to Morocco, ride a
camel three stops to the border,

11:44.938 --> 11:46.420
and then take
a magic carpet ride

11:46.456 --> 11:48.014
all the way back to Roanoke.

11:48.049 --> 11:50.825
- I don't like your attitude.
- Stick it in your report.

11:56.391 --> 11:58.499
Boy, I am starving.

12:01.537 --> 12:03.621
Yeah, me, too.
Everything looks really good.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.814
Order whatever you want.
My treat.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.093
( Stammering ) Your treat?

12:08.128 --> 12:10.311
You know what?

12:10.346 --> 12:12.680
I haven't decided yet. You go.

12:12.716 --> 12:14.036
I'll have a slice
and an iced tea.

12:15.351 --> 12:20.221
And I will have the...

12:20.256 --> 12:21.898
water.

12:23.893 --> 12:26.744
From the tap.

12:26.779 --> 12:28.704
I'm actually not that hungry.

12:28.739 --> 12:29.764
You just said you were starving.

12:29.799 --> 12:33.001
I know, but I totally
forgot I ate

12:33.036 --> 12:35.111
a huge meal right
before I came here.

12:35.146 --> 12:37.638
Not huge. Reasonable.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.691
I ate my fair share of a meal.

12:40.726 --> 12:42.526
Don't wanna be all...
nom-nom-nom.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.554
More food for me!

12:44.589 --> 12:46.664
( Nervous laughter ) You know.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.800
No, not really.
She'll take a slice.

12:52.071 --> 12:54.511
Actually, make it two.
I really am starving.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.774
( Cell phone rings )

13:04.809 --> 13:06.417
What's up, KC?

13:06.452 --> 13:09.720
I'm in the middle of something
really important right here.

13:09.755 --> 13:12.657
Do you remember that one
thing I said

13:12.692 --> 13:14.500
when you and Mom brought
Ernie home from the hospital?

13:14.535 --> 13:15.793
Yeah, well, I was right.

13:15.828 --> 13:16.994
He's ruining everything!

13:18.431 --> 13:20.565
He lost the card.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.984
KC, the Organization
needs that card.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.885
There's a field agent
in Istanbul

13:24.920 --> 13:27.388
waiting for that intel.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.489
If he doesn't get it,
his cover could be blown,

13:28.524 --> 13:30.691
and he could be eliminated.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.852
Okay, let's talk
hypothetical, all right.

13:32.887 --> 13:34.954
I mean, is this agent
super likeable,

13:34.989 --> 13:37.707
or is he someone we could
turn our backs on

13:37.742 --> 13:39.902
and maybe he could
figure it out for himself?

13:40.845 --> 13:43.112
KC!

13:43.147 --> 13:45.731
Okay. Fine. I'll handle it.

13:45.766 --> 13:48.350
( Stammering )
It's not completely lost.

13:48.386 --> 13:52.588
We actually narrowed it down
to one specific location.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.223
Good. Find it, bring it in.

13:54.259 --> 13:55.508
<i>Got it.</i>

13:55.543 --> 13:57.468
I know it's in here.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.828
Somewhere.

14:18.916 --> 14:20.683
We need to find
that SD card, KC.

14:20.718 --> 14:22.427
Keep digging.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.261
You know what I would dig?

14:24.297 --> 14:26.239
If you would get off your butt
and help me.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.049
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you want
to make a scale model

14:28.084 --> 14:30.259
of the garbage dump
out of Popsicle sticks?

14:30.294 --> 14:32.261
I swear, if the next words
out of your mouth

14:32.297 --> 14:34.055
are "Ernie's log,"

14:34.090 --> 14:35.648
I will actually hit you
with a log.

14:35.683 --> 14:37.157
I will dig through this garbage,

14:37.193 --> 14:39.001
find a log, and mark my words,

14:39.036 --> 14:40.116
I will hit you with it.

14:45.826 --> 14:48.727
( Whispering )
Ernie's log, supplemental.

14:48.763 --> 14:52.257
KC threatening
physical violence. Ow!

14:52.292 --> 14:53.549
I warned you.

14:55.870 --> 14:59.430
Ugh. It could not get any worse.

14:59.465 --> 15:01.682
( Crows cawing )

15:08.691 --> 15:10.600
- Guess it can.
- KC!

15:10.635 --> 15:12.810
This isn't a petting zoo.

15:12.845 --> 15:15.621
Look, can I be honest with you?

15:15.656 --> 15:18.757
I've worked very hard
on this mission,

15:18.793 --> 15:22.003
and I'm truly disappointed
that, at every turn,

15:22.005 --> 15:24.497
you've been nothing but
an obstacle to my success.

15:24.532 --> 15:26.916
What is it, KC?

15:26.951 --> 15:29.360
Is it jealousy?

15:29.395 --> 15:31.821
Is that what's really
going on here?

15:31.856 --> 15:34.332
You know, Ernie,
I am so glad to see

15:34.367 --> 15:37.185
that you are so confident.

15:37.187 --> 15:38.819
Maybe, just maybe,
you're a little too confident.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.612
Because if you haven't noticed,

15:40.648 --> 15:43.558
your mission is a giant fail.

15:43.593 --> 15:45.543
Because of you.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.028
And the Organization
will know that

15:47.063 --> 15:48.629
because it's all in my report.

15:48.665 --> 15:50.923
News flash, Ernie.

15:50.958 --> 15:51.950
No one cares about
your stupid little report.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.326
And no one's ever gonna
hear your stupid little report

15:54.362 --> 15:57.455
because no one is expecting you
to write a stupid little report.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.674
Guess what. The Organization
didn't put you in charge

16:00.710 --> 16:02.885
of this mission, Ernie. I did.

16:02.921 --> 16:03.327
I'm the one that put you
in charge of this mission,

16:03.362 --> 16:06.597
because I wanted to help
you with your self-confidence.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.950
So please, go ahead.
Tell me all about

16:08.985 --> 16:10.701
your stupid little report.

16:10.736 --> 16:12.453
I would love to hear it...

16:12.488 --> 16:13.879
never!

16:19.796 --> 16:21.053
( Crows cawing )

16:24.592 --> 16:29.145
Wow. I guess it's just
open season to poop on Ernie.

16:34.752 --> 16:35.876
You know what? I got it.

16:35.912 --> 16:36.710
I asked you out; It's on me.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.646
Yeah, but I am a feminist.

16:39.682 --> 16:41.607
You don't need to try
to buy my affection.

16:41.642 --> 16:43.709
I'm not trying
to buy your affection.

16:43.744 --> 16:45.435
I'm trying to buy you
a slice of pizza.

16:45.471 --> 16:47.580
- But you can't afford it.
- But I can. I have a part-time job.

16:47.615 --> 16:48.948
That money should go
to help your family.

16:48.983 --> 16:50.103
That's really not your call.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.552
So we'll split it?

16:55.781 --> 16:58.741
Look, Adam, I'm so sorry.

16:58.776 --> 17:00.159
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

17:00.194 --> 17:02.953
I'm not usually like this.

17:02.988 --> 17:05.856
Um, just, I've never
dated someone

17:05.891 --> 17:07.282
in your... economic situation.

17:07.318 --> 17:09.443
I know that sounds terrible.

17:09.478 --> 17:11.003
I shouldn't even call it that.

17:11.038 --> 17:12.438
Why not? I am in
an economic situation.

17:12.473 --> 17:14.357
And so are you.

17:14.392 --> 17:16.925
Your economic situation just
happens to be better than mine.

17:16.961 --> 17:19.478
I know. I know.

17:19.514 --> 17:21.096
I have lived a disgustingly
privileged life.

17:21.132 --> 17:23.949
It's not my fault I was born the
daughter of two over-achievers,

17:23.984 --> 17:25.401
but I am doing my best
to break the cycle.

17:25.436 --> 17:27.111
Marisa.

17:27.146 --> 17:30.472
Chill.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.758
It doesn't matter
how much or how little you have.

17:32.793 --> 17:35.243
It's about who you are,
and you're cool.

17:35.279 --> 17:38.022
You care about others
and you're giving back.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.948
I like that about you.

17:39.984 --> 17:42.701
Thanks.

17:42.736 --> 17:45.136
This is something
new I'm trying.

17:47.074 --> 17:49.416
Okay, fine, you can pay.
This time.

17:49.452 --> 17:50.559
Thank you.

17:52.980 --> 17:55.014
So what do you wanna do now?

17:55.049 --> 17:57.058
Go to the movies
or play mini golf?

17:57.093 --> 17:58.533
What, do you think
I'm made of money?

18:02.323 --> 18:04.047
Oh, hey, look at that.

18:04.083 --> 18:04.966
That's the third
Justin Bieber T-shirt

18:05.001 --> 18:06.600
I've seen out here.

18:06.636 --> 18:07.910
I can't Belieb it.

18:10.106 --> 18:12.240
Come on, bro, that was funny.
Lighten up.

18:12.275 --> 18:14.884
So what exactly
was your plan, KC?

18:14.919 --> 18:16.719
To make me feel like garbage?

18:16.754 --> 18:18.912
Because thanks to you, I do.

18:18.948 --> 18:20.668
And no, not just because
I'm standing in it.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.925
Look, bro, I was just
trying to help you.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.435
Who asked you?

18:24.470 --> 18:25.953
I didn't need your help.

18:25.988 --> 18:27.504
I'm just as good
an agent as you are.

18:27.540 --> 18:31.667
In fact, I might be better
if I ever got a real chance.

18:31.702 --> 18:33.544
Okay, come on, bro,
let's not kid ourselves.

18:33.579 --> 18:34.570
You're just not as strong
as I am.

18:34.606 --> 18:36.472
In what way?

18:36.507 --> 18:38.949
Uh, mentally, physically,

18:38.984 --> 18:41.185
personal hygiene-ally.

18:41.220 --> 18:45.039
Uh, pretty much everything.

18:45.074 --> 18:47.257
- Pick your area.
- What are you saying?

18:47.293 --> 18:48.867
I'm saying I'm
a better agent than you.

18:48.903 --> 18:50.711
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

18:50.747 --> 18:52.847
Oh, really?

18:52.882 --> 18:55.332
Bring it.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.685
Okay, bro, come on. Cut it out.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.312
Bring it.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.828
I am not fighting
my little brother.

19:08.231 --> 19:11.098
Is that all you got?
I said bring it.

19:12.769 --> 19:15.077
Okay. Okay.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.673
You know what?
You asked for it, junior.

19:22.678 --> 19:23.819
Yeah!

19:40.854 --> 19:41.954
I am in 50 feet of garbage,

19:41.990 --> 19:44.340
and that is still the worst
thing I have ever smelled.

19:47.544 --> 19:50.512
Why you hitting yourself?
Why you hitting yourself?

19:53.576 --> 19:55.560
You asked for it.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.903
Don't you dare.

19:57.938 --> 19:59.178
It's Wet Willie time.

20:01.008 --> 20:04.676
Wet Willie, Wet Willie.

20:04.712 --> 20:06.612
( Both laughing )

20:15.789 --> 20:19.508
Why? Why would you lie to me?

20:19.543 --> 20:22.169
Bro, I'm sorry I lied to you.

20:22.204 --> 20:24.113
It's just that
I was trying to help you.

20:24.148 --> 20:26.957
So in other words,
you think I'm so pathetic

20:26.993 --> 20:28.659
that the only way I can
accomplish something

20:28.694 --> 20:30.536
is if you pretend that I do?

20:30.571 --> 20:31.921
No, I don't think
you're pathetic.

20:31.956 --> 20:34.364
You think you're pathetic.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.650
And honestly,
that's a little pathetic.

20:36.685 --> 20:38.435
- What are you talking about?
- Akina.

20:38.470 --> 20:40.971
She was ready to pick up
whatever you were putting down,

20:41.007 --> 20:43.415
but the only thing you were
putting down was yourself.

20:43.450 --> 20:46.293
You can't expect anyone to
believe in you if you don't.

20:46.329 --> 20:49.705
- You know what? Call her.
- What?

20:49.707 --> 20:52.649
You heard me. Call Akina
right now and ask her out.

20:52.685 --> 20:53.959
I would if someone hadn't
thrown my phone

20:53.994 --> 20:56.287
into a pile of garbage.

21:06.623 --> 21:08.633
Please don't answer.
Please don't answer.

21:08.668 --> 21:09.875
Please don't...

21:09.910 --> 21:11.677
Akina.

21:11.712 --> 21:14.279
Hi. It's Ernie.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.982
Uh, I was just wondering
if you wanted

21:17.017 --> 21:18.737
to go out with me sometime.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.804
You would? Great!

21:21.839 --> 21:24.356
Just to clarify,

21:24.391 --> 21:26.391
you do know this is
Ernie Cooper, right?

21:28.237 --> 21:30.279
Uh, okay. See you at school.

21:33.759 --> 21:36.510
Wow. My little brother's
got a date.

21:36.546 --> 21:39.989
And I am knee deep
in what I am praying is pudding.

21:40.024 --> 21:42.124
How did this become my life?

21:42.159 --> 21:43.584
Sh.

21:46.563 --> 21:48.097
Wait a minute. Is that...

21:48.132 --> 21:49.823
The SD card's in its mouth.

21:49.859 --> 21:51.900
Okay, okay, okay.

21:51.936 --> 21:54.136
Hey, little birdy.
Hey, little birdy.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.981
( Screaming )

21:58.016 --> 22:00.768
Okay, that works, too.

22:00.803 --> 22:02.736
Aha!

22:02.771 --> 22:05.356
I got it. I got it.

22:05.391 --> 22:06.732
Nice work, bro.

22:06.767 --> 22:08.793
You know what?

22:08.828 --> 22:10.294
You're a good sister.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.204
Thanks, bro.

22:12.239 --> 22:14.415
Maybe you should
hold on to this.

22:14.450 --> 22:17.076
- No, man, you got it.
- Okay.

22:21.473 --> 22:24.333
KC's log. Single-handedly
retrieved SD card.

22:24.368 --> 22:26.085
( Crow cawing )

KC's log, supplemental.

22:34.128 --> 22:35.719
Ernie helped.

22:42.728 --> 22:44.645
Thanks for coming over, Akina.

22:44.680 --> 22:45.846
I had a great time
hanging out with you.

22:45.881 --> 22:48.516
So far, so good.

22:48.551 --> 22:50.383
I had fun hanging with you, too.

22:50.419 --> 22:52.202
And talking to you.

22:52.237 --> 22:54.938
And watching a movie with you.

22:54.974 --> 22:59.384
I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

22:59.420 --> 23:00.940
Look at Ernie
stepping up to the plate.

23:06.184 --> 23:08.652
See ya at school tomorrow.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.605
Come on!

23:11.641 --> 23:13.601
That boy ain't never
gonna move out of this house.
