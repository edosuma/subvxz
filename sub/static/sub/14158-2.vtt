WEBVTT

00:22.400 --> 00:25.267
Come closer! I won't
do anything, I promise!
( girls scream )

00:25.367 --> 00:27.400
Jonah:
I moved back from Tonga
'cause I was too naughty.

00:27.500 --> 00:30.200
*
( Mamafu speaks Tongan )

00:30.300 --> 00:32.234
Jonah is like
a fucking idiot.

00:32.334 --> 00:34.134
See you, Tonga!
He said, "Get fucked!"

00:34.234 --> 00:37.134
Jonah:
Now I'm in Year 9 at Holy Cross
Catholic High School.

00:37.234 --> 00:38.967
You just call me
a ranga, mate?
Well, you are one.

00:39.067 --> 00:41.100
Get out, rangas!
( hip-hop music playing )

00:41.200 --> 00:42.934
Jonah:
I'm in a crew called
"Fobba-liscious,"

00:43.034 --> 00:46.167
which means
we're good-looking
and we're Fobs.

00:46.267 --> 00:48.900
Could straighten
the end of my rat's tail?
Your work's incomplete, Jonah.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.400
Your dick's incomplete.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.134
Jonah:
All us boys are
in Lazarus House.

00:52.234 --> 00:54.000
You're too
fucking slow, mate.

00:54.100 --> 00:56.134
Jonah:
It's for behavioral kids
that need extra attention.

00:56.234 --> 00:58.167
Sir, my shit wouldn't
fit in this pipe.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.267
Jonah:
Our teacher,
Mr. Joseph, is a legend.

01:00.367 --> 01:02.600
Shut the fuck up!

01:02.700 --> 01:06.334
I'm the adult here
and I'll fucking swear
if I choose to swear.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.567
Go and marry my dick, Sir.

01:07.667 --> 01:08.967
Jonah:
I used to be really naughty

01:09.067 --> 01:10.267
and always
getting in trouble...

01:10.367 --> 01:12.334
Do you guys like cameras?
We can keep this?

01:12.434 --> 01:14.734
...but now I'm good.
And with my Takalua tattoo

01:14.834 --> 01:17.000
and my mom watching
over me from heaven,

01:17.100 --> 01:19.434
I'm gonna be good
at school, get into uni

01:19.534 --> 01:21.300
and be rich
and successful.

01:21.400 --> 01:25.634
Go to bed, shit-for-brains.
Go to bed, fat-for-brains.

01:25.734 --> 01:28.500
( theme music playing )

01:40.867 --> 01:43.134
( clicking, thuds )

01:43.234 --> 01:45.767
( monkey chatters )

01:48.967 --> 01:51.467
( pop music playing )
* My baby

01:51.567 --> 01:55.934
* Please don't
leave me now *

01:56.034 --> 01:59.267
* Kiss me
till the sun goes down. *

01:59.367 --> 02:01.334
Woman:
We find that the involvement
of the older students

02:01.434 --> 02:02.700
really enriches
the learning experience

02:02.800 --> 02:04.834
for the Year 7s and it boosts
their confidence.

02:04.934 --> 02:06.367
And, Jonah,
you'll be working

02:06.467 --> 02:08.534
with your actual little brother,
so that's wonderful.

02:08.634 --> 02:10.667
So again,
thank you all for coming

02:10.767 --> 02:12.634
and I look forward
to Reading Buddies
this afternoon.

02:12.734 --> 02:13.767
Thank you.

02:16.867 --> 02:19.234
You gonna teach
your little brother
everything?

02:19.334 --> 02:20.567
Yes.
And not fuck around?

02:20.667 --> 02:23.234
Not be a little
shithead for once?
Maybe.

02:23.334 --> 02:26.034
What period do
I have to come here?
I dunno.

02:26.134 --> 02:29.767
Miss, what period
do I have to come here?
First period after lunch.

02:29.867 --> 02:31.034
I've already told
Mr. Joseph.

02:31.134 --> 02:32.500
Fuck that!
I'll miss Design.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.100
Watch your language
in here, thank you.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.334
Sorry, Miss.
Love you, Miss.

02:36.434 --> 02:38.400
Are you gonna be good?
Yeah, I'm always good.

02:38.500 --> 02:39.934
Bullshit.
You're always a fuckwit.

02:40.034 --> 02:42.234
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

02:42.334 --> 02:45.100
You are. Why don't you
go marry your dick?

02:45.200 --> 02:47.234
You want me
to smack your asshole?
No.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.500
You want to be cheeky?
No.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.534
Siana, look at me.

02:50.634 --> 02:53.000
You gotta teach
your brother what to do...

02:53.100 --> 02:54.567
I will.
...not what you wanna do.

02:54.667 --> 02:57.200
I will. Sorry. Sorry.
You better be.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.267
( mockingly )
I'm gonna be good.
You'd better be good.

02:59.367 --> 03:01.000
Go to work.
Oh, I'm gonna smack you one.

03:01.100 --> 03:03.100
Go away.
Don't talk to me like that.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.000
Don't talk
to my dick like that.
Don't you talk to me like that.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.334
Little shit.
Little homo.

03:07.434 --> 03:08.700
I say what?
Jonah: Nothing.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.534
I said what?
I just said--

03:10.634 --> 03:12.667
Are you trying
to be a smart--

03:12.767 --> 03:14.134
are you trying
to be a smart ass?
I said go home now.

03:14.234 --> 03:15.467
Is that what
you're gonna teach him?

03:15.567 --> 03:16.767
I said little--
I will teach you--

03:16.867 --> 03:18.600
Stop that.
Don't you touch me!

03:18.700 --> 03:20.134
You thought I said,
"little homo."

03:20.234 --> 03:21.467
I said, "Go home now."

03:21.567 --> 03:22.834
I was telling you
to go home,

03:22.934 --> 03:24.367
so relax.
Don't make me come back.

03:24.467 --> 03:25.700
Don't you dare
make me come back.
Chill out.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.367
Jonah: Chill, Dad. Chill.
Moses: Go, Dad. Go away.

03:27.467 --> 03:30.100
Stupid little shit.
Love you, Aunty.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.434
Love you, Aunty.

03:31.534 --> 03:33.934
Be a good boy, Jonah.
Love you, Moses.

03:34.034 --> 03:36.267
Bye, Aunty.

03:36.367 --> 03:38.367
( sighs )
( door opens )

03:38.467 --> 03:40.167
So many rangas
in your year.

03:40.267 --> 03:42.567
( door closes )
Yeah, I know.
There's heaps.

03:42.667 --> 03:44.634
I wanna get rid
of them all.
Same.

03:44.734 --> 03:47.400
Hey, Graydon's little brother
looks like a homo.

03:47.500 --> 03:51.700
He is one.
Why do you think his mom
hasn't got red hair?

03:51.800 --> 03:54.800
I dunno.
Maybe she was drinking
too much Fanta

03:54.900 --> 03:57.967
when they were
in her stomach.
( both laugh )

03:58.067 --> 04:00.600
( reggae music playing )

04:06.867 --> 04:09.234
Sonny:
So we'd be filming
you right now, Sir.

04:09.334 --> 04:12.167
You get it?
Come here.
Why are you so late?

04:12.267 --> 04:13.800
I had to do a shit, sir.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.234
Siana,
that's sick as.

04:15.334 --> 04:16.867
Come on,
get over here now.

04:16.967 --> 04:18.967
Joseph:
Well, they're teenage boys.

04:19.067 --> 04:21.467
The decision-making
part of their brain isn't
fully developed,

04:21.567 --> 04:24.800
so that's why they do such
fucked-up things sometimes.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.767
What I've been
made aware of just now

04:26.867 --> 04:29.967
could probably
only be described
as the work of morons.

04:30.067 --> 04:32.967
( boys laugh )
That's us.

04:33.067 --> 04:34.534
Well, since Jonah came along,

04:34.634 --> 04:38.900
he's 100% led
some of these boys astray.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.434
They're doing
some pretty stupid things
since he came along.

04:41.534 --> 04:43.467
We've got "Fobba-liscious
Bully Video 1."

04:43.567 --> 04:45.100
Oh, but that was
a mean one, eh?
Yeah.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.034
Joseph:
"Fobba-liscious Bully Video 2."

04:47.134 --> 04:49.367
Sir, #2!
#2 is way better than #1.
Which #2?

04:49.467 --> 04:51.167
#2, Sir. #2.
That's a mean one.

04:51.267 --> 04:54.567
There's more.
"Jonah makes Year 7 homo
eat dog shit."

04:54.667 --> 04:57.600
( boys laugh )
I didn't make him
eat it, Sir.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.300
I just made him taste it.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.534
And you're filming
all this with this
fucking thing on your head.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.467
Yeah.
Yes Sir. We call it
our bully-cam.

05:03.567 --> 05:05.334
It's bully-cam.
There's more, Sir.

05:05.434 --> 05:07.367
Click the menus.
Ah! I don't want
to know about any more.

05:07.467 --> 05:09.800
I'm still trying
to get my head around
this fucking shit.

05:09.900 --> 05:11.700
No Sir,
you should watch this one.
This one's gun as.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.600
Which one's that?
Scroll down to it, sir.

05:13.700 --> 05:15.400
( sighs )
That one there.
If you're gonna watch one,

05:15.500 --> 05:16.600
you watch that one.
Manu: Yeah, Sir.

05:16.700 --> 05:18.867
We get to spin him around
and then he runs

05:18.967 --> 05:21.567
and then he spews after.
Oh yeah, "Fobba-liscious
Bully Video with spew."

05:21.667 --> 05:23.500
I don't wanna--
get out of the fuck--

05:23.600 --> 05:26.000
I've just had
a kid's dad on the phone
and he wants some action.

05:26.100 --> 05:28.734
Now he gets the cops involved,
we're all fucked!

05:28.834 --> 05:31.367
Joseph:
My situation is that

05:31.467 --> 05:34.167
the principal of Holy Cross
isn't exactly a fan of mine.

05:34.267 --> 05:37.067
The truth is he--

05:37.167 --> 05:38.767
he wants
Laz House shut down

05:38.867 --> 05:42.067
and this lot
integrated back into
the mainstream classes.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.467
We all know
that's gonna end badly.

05:44.567 --> 05:46.467
So when they go
doing shit like this,

05:46.567 --> 05:49.300
you know--
you can see my dilemma.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.134
We're just trying to be
YouTube sensations, Sir.

05:51.234 --> 05:52.400
Sir, you can get
money off these ads.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.334
We want
to be popular, Sir.
Yeah.

05:54.434 --> 05:56.934
Tell the kid's dad
that his kid might get
famous from that.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.938
Yeah. Right.

05:57.034 --> 05:59.134
Make a lot of money.
Don't make me
fucking punch you, mate.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.734
[DOG GROWLlNG]

05:59.234 --> 06:01.334
I'll fucking whack you,
and you know I will.

06:01.434 --> 06:04.600
Just stop bullying
young kids.

06:04.700 --> 06:07.400
The kid that
we did the dog shit to,
he was picking on Moses.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.134
The whole lot of you are gonna
end up in fucking juvie.

06:09.234 --> 06:11.067
Believe me,
I've seen it all before.

06:11.167 --> 06:13.200
Can't go to juvie
for being bullies.
You haven't seen nothing, Sir.

06:13.300 --> 06:15.000
You don't go to juvie
for being bullies.
Oh, you can't?

06:15.100 --> 06:16.967
You're a legal expert,
are you?
You've gotta break the law.

06:17.067 --> 06:19.467
You've gotta stab someone.
You can't even spell
fucking "legal."

06:19.567 --> 06:22.667
He can!
Spell "legal"!
Fuck off.

06:22.767 --> 06:25.334
( boys laugh )
Right. Now I want you
to do me a favor.

06:25.434 --> 06:27.600
Don't wanna do anything.
I haven't fucking
said anything yet.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.567
Joseph:
Just shut the fuck up.
It doesn't matter, Sir.

06:29.667 --> 06:31.700
It's gonna be shit.
All your favors are gay.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.167
Right.
Manu: Yeah, favor.

06:33.267 --> 06:35.500
There's a new
youth worker at school.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.434
He's a Fob.
He's a bit of a poofter,

06:37.534 --> 06:39.400
but he's into singing
and dancing and shit,

06:39.500 --> 06:41.900
and I figured
you lot'd like him.
Your mom's gonna like him.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.234
And your dad.
He sounds gay as, Sir.

06:43.334 --> 06:44.900
He's--
look, he's okay.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.700
I've spoke to him.
He's not too bad.
Anyway, I told him--

06:47.800 --> 06:49.667
Why don't you
marry him then, Sir?
Yeah.

06:49.767 --> 06:51.734
Will you shut
the fuck up?

06:51.834 --> 06:54.367
Will you-- shh!
I don't-- I don't want
to see this homo.

06:54.467 --> 06:55.834
Just let me finish!
Let the poofta--

06:55.934 --> 06:58.434
How, Sir,
are we gonna--
I told him about you.

06:58.534 --> 07:00.534
Anyway, he reckons
with a bit of counseling,

07:00.634 --> 07:02.534
he'd probably
sort you lot out.
I fucking doubt that.

07:02.634 --> 07:05.000
We don't wanna do it, Sir.
Sounds gay.
Yeah.

07:05.100 --> 07:08.134
Listen, give me something,
anything,

07:08.234 --> 07:09.600
that I can give
this kid's dad.

07:09.700 --> 07:13.034
( hip-hop music playing )

07:13.134 --> 07:15.767
Man:
Attitude. Shake!

07:15.867 --> 07:17.534
Nice.

07:23.934 --> 07:25.334
Good stuff.

07:28.467 --> 07:30.434
Hey.
Jonah:
I'm not doing it.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.567
Sir, that looks gay.
Not doing it.

07:32.667 --> 07:33.734
My dad can dance better.

07:33.834 --> 07:35.467
Laz House boys
in the house!

07:35.567 --> 07:37.600
( boys shout )
Shut up. Shut up.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.967
Jonah:
I'm not doing
that shit, Sir. No way.

07:40.067 --> 07:42.567
( boys mutter )
What the hell is that?

07:42.667 --> 07:44.267
Ooh.
( laughing )

07:44.367 --> 07:46.100
What have you got
down your pants?

07:46.200 --> 07:48.567
I've got a stiffy
over you, sir.
Get it out.

07:48.667 --> 07:50.400
( laughing, chattering )
He wants me to get it out!

07:50.500 --> 07:52.634
I'm too young for you, Sir!

07:52.734 --> 07:53.934
Are you gay,
fool?

07:54.034 --> 07:55.800
Kris:
Hey, boys,
come join in!

07:55.900 --> 07:57.534
See if you can pick it up.
Grab a spot at the back.

07:57.634 --> 08:01.100
Hey! We're--
we're not going to.
Join in.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.767
I'm not doing that.
No way.
You do it.

08:02.867 --> 08:04.100
He's a butt bandit.
Nuh-uh, Sir.
Not gonna happen.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.534
No way.
Can't do it.

08:05.634 --> 08:07.067
What, you're just
such pussies...
You do it.

08:07.167 --> 08:08.500
that you do everything
Jonah says, is that it?

08:08.600 --> 08:10.367
Well, it's not the style
of dancing that we do.

08:10.467 --> 08:12.034
Israel: Yes Sir.
Jonah:
That's homo dancing.

08:12.134 --> 08:15.334
Listen to me, boy.
I didn't walk all
the fucking way down here

08:15.434 --> 08:17.800
with rheumatoid arthritis
in my left knee

08:17.900 --> 08:19.867
to watch you faggots
standing around.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.200
Now this bloke's
just new at the school,

08:21.300 --> 08:23.134
so show him
some fucking respect

08:23.234 --> 08:26.167
and get the fuck in there
and do some... dancing.

08:26.267 --> 08:28.534
I'm not doing it.
Fuck off, Sir.
Yeah.

08:28.634 --> 08:30.134
Get the fuck in there, fuck you.
Get the fuck in there.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.267
Get in, you piece of--
Let's do it.

08:33.367 --> 08:35.500
Do it.
Go!
We're gonna do it, boys!

08:35.600 --> 08:37.167
We're doing it, sir.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.367
We're doing this shit...
for you.

08:39.467 --> 08:41.467
We gotta do it, boys.
Boys, we gotta do it.

08:42.534 --> 08:45.234
( grunting )
So fuck me.

08:45.334 --> 08:46.800
Israel:
Touch your head,
touch your head.

08:48.534 --> 08:50.434
( chattering )

08:50.534 --> 08:52.034
( laughter )

08:52.134 --> 08:54.100
Kris: Right.
Ah, touch your face.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.000
And six, seven and pow!

08:57.100 --> 08:59.034
Blah!
Blah!
Blah.

08:59.134 --> 09:00.367
Nice.
Good stuff, guys.

09:00.467 --> 09:03.900
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
Awesome work.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.167
Kris:
Hey, listen...
Gay boy!

09:06.267 --> 09:09.200
The "Feel the Beat"
dance and talent competition...
Jonah: Homo! Gay!

09:09.300 --> 09:11.567
Gaybo!
...is open to small groups
of three to 10.

09:11.667 --> 09:14.334
And I see some great
potential in you guys.
Gay!
Gay.

09:14.434 --> 09:16.267
All right,
my name is Kool Kris.

09:16.367 --> 09:19.734
I am a youth worker
and I'm taking over
pastoral care.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.434
I just got here
at Holy Cross

09:21.534 --> 09:23.634
and obviously
I'm a pretty kick-ass
hip-hop dancer.

09:23.734 --> 09:25.700
Gay.
So come and see me
and get involved

09:25.800 --> 09:27.767
and make
a difference in your lives,
all right, guys?

09:27.867 --> 09:29.667
Kool Kris signing out.
Peace.

09:29.767 --> 09:32.067
Kool Kris!
Gay boy!
Homo!

09:32.167 --> 09:34.300
Kool Kris!
( laughing, chattering )

09:34.400 --> 09:36.000
Signing out...
He's a homo.

09:36.100 --> 09:38.500
...because I'm a homo.
Hey, Mr. Homo!

09:38.600 --> 09:41.567
Hey, that's not my name.
That's not my name.
Mr. Homo.

09:41.667 --> 09:43.034
What's your name?
My name's Mr. Fonua

09:43.134 --> 09:45.367
and people call me
Kool Kris. K.K.

09:45.467 --> 09:47.167
You're full churchy?
What, like, full Catholic?

09:47.267 --> 09:50.200
Yeah yeah,
I'm a devoted Catholic.
Oh! Holy shit!

09:50.300 --> 09:53.134
( boys laugh )
Holy shit!
So no sex for you, sir.

09:53.234 --> 09:55.000
No, I'll wait for that
connection till I'm married.

09:55.100 --> 09:56.867
What about dicky dicky?
Boys: Dicky dicky.

09:56.967 --> 09:59.467
( chattering )
Listen, listen.

09:59.567 --> 10:02.134
Listen, cuz,
we can talk about the Bible

10:02.234 --> 10:03.634
and the Catholic Church
any time you want to.

10:03.734 --> 10:05.234
I bet you have a little tug
every now and then, Sir.

10:05.334 --> 10:06.934
Ooh!
Yeah, you do.

10:07.034 --> 10:09.734
You do, Sir!
You're breaking the rules
of the Bible!

10:09.834 --> 10:12.234
Oh, true?
Oh. You're a tough guy,
eh, Jonah?

10:12.334 --> 10:14.434
Leader of the gang?
Mr. Joseph told me about you.
Yeah, I'm the leader.

10:14.534 --> 10:16.600
I'm the leader of the gang.
I'm with Jonah.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.500
It's not a gang anyway, sir.
It's just a crew.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.434
Fobba-liscious.
Boys: Fobba-liscious.

10:20.534 --> 10:22.034
Okay, cool.
Fobba-liscious.

10:22.134 --> 10:23.600
Well, look.
I wanna offer you something

10:23.700 --> 10:25.800
that you might find tough
to say yes to, all right?

10:25.900 --> 10:27.800
I want you guys to come see me,
have a chat as a group.

10:27.900 --> 10:30.734
All right?
Just air some issues you might
have with the school.

10:30.834 --> 10:32.100
Just you guys, me.
Jonah:
I'm not doing that.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.400
Shut up.
Ew, yeah.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.034
We can maybe just build
a relationship.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.300
A relationship?
We're not gay, sir.

10:37.400 --> 10:40.634
Okay, not that kind
of relationship, all right?

10:40.734 --> 10:42.667
More like a friendship.
That's even more gay, Sir!

10:42.767 --> 10:44.800
We're not interested, Sir!
We don't need to talk to you.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.667
All right, look,
have a think about it.
We're not doing it!

10:46.767 --> 10:48.767
We don't need to talk
to you about anything, Sir.

10:48.867 --> 10:51.467
All right. Well, you don't
need to call me "Sir."
Just call me Kool Kris.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.234
Why do they
call you Kool Kris?
You're not that cool.

10:54.334 --> 10:55.500
Yeah, Sir.
You're not that cool.
( laughter )

10:55.600 --> 10:57.200
I'm not gonna
give up on you. Hey!

10:57.300 --> 10:59.167
I'll see you guys
at the Legit Crew Dance Demo

10:59.267 --> 11:00.767
at recess.
I organized it.

11:00.867 --> 11:03.100
Oh yeah, Sir.
I look forward
to not going to that.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.400
( laughs )
See you, guys.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.667
See you, Sir!

11:07.767 --> 11:08.667
( hip-hop music playing )

11:36.200 --> 11:39.000

11:39.100 --> 11:40.467
Mary.

11:40.567 --> 11:41.867
Mary!

11:41.967 --> 11:45.534
Fatty! Fatty!
What?!

11:45.634 --> 11:47.934
You know you're standing next
to someone with Fanta pubes?

11:48.034 --> 11:50.867
( boys laugh )
You're funny, man.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.067
Jonah, Jonah,
Melody's looking over.

11:55.167 --> 11:57.900
'Cause she wants
to suck my dick.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.567
Melody! Melody!

12:00.667 --> 12:02.434
Melody! Here!

12:02.534 --> 12:05.167
What are you doing?
Nothing.

12:05.267 --> 12:08.334
Going bowling on Saturday?
Melody: Maybe.

12:08.434 --> 12:10.134
Manu:
Jonah, she's your cousin.
Jonah: I don't even care.

12:10.234 --> 12:11.767
Jonah wants to finger
his cousin.

12:11.867 --> 12:14.034
You want
to finger your cousin?
Yes, 'cause she's hot as.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.767
Boy, that's disgusting to me.
I've seen her in the bath
when we were little.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.134
When? Seriously?
She saw my dick.

12:18.234 --> 12:19.234
How small was it?
Holy Cross.

12:19.334 --> 12:23.200
Jonah: Fuck you.
( cheering )

12:23.300 --> 12:26.067
How's it going?
( cheering loudly )

12:27.467 --> 12:29.200
Hey, any of you guys out there
fancy yourselves a dancer?

12:29.300 --> 12:30.567
Any of you guys a B-boy?

12:30.667 --> 12:32.200
Bro, he's calling you, bro.
Yeah? Breaking?

12:32.300 --> 12:33.400
Go up!
Anyone into that?

12:33.500 --> 12:35.000
Please don't.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.434
Graydon:
Jonah Takalua!

12:36.534 --> 12:39.334
Reckons he's best
in the school, eh?

12:39.434 --> 12:41.267
For the boys.
For the boys.
Fobba-liscious.

12:41.367 --> 12:42.467
Go for the boys.
For the boys.

12:42.567 --> 12:44.167
Throwing your beef in.
Dancer: My man.

12:44.267 --> 12:45.534
Show us a move, cuz.

12:45.634 --> 12:46.900
Come on, bro.
Stun, bro.
( cheering )

12:47.000 --> 12:49.834

Hey. Whoo!

12:49.934 --> 12:52.734

13:26.634 --> 13:30.300
Whoa! You suck!
You're shit, man!

13:35.067 --> 13:37.400
Who cares about
that Fanta ranga, bro?
We'll get him after.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.234
We'll get him after.
That was such
an epic fail, Jonah.

13:39.334 --> 13:40.467
I can't believe
I'm related to you.

13:40.567 --> 13:42.034
You seriously think
you're good?

13:42.134 --> 13:44.334
Fucking embarrassing, man.
You're so bad.

13:44.434 --> 13:46.500
Can't dance for shit.
That is not my brother.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.034
Shut the fuck up!
Graydon:
You shut up. Fuck you!

13:49.134 --> 13:50.300
( hip-hop music playing )

13:50.400 --> 13:52.267
Want me to beat
the shit out of you?

13:52.367 --> 13:54.067
Come over here.
Yeah, I'll fucking smash you.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.267
Graydon: So you think
you're fucking good?
What would you fucking know?

13:56.367 --> 13:58.567
Check this out, boys.
Yeah.

13:58.667 --> 14:01.567
Jonah: Fuck you!
Fucking with his knees
and stuff.

14:01.667 --> 14:03.134
( laughter )

14:03.234 --> 14:05.300
( cheering )
Graydon:
Such a dickhead.

14:05.400 --> 14:08.000
( chattering )
Gonna fucking smash you.

14:08.100 --> 14:10.600
Try me.
( cheering )

14:13.000 --> 14:16.134
Jonah:
Fucking homos!
I hate fucking rangas!

14:16.234 --> 14:17.934
I wanna kick
their heads in!
We'll get them back.

14:18.034 --> 14:20.467
All right,
Jonah, don't worry.
Graydon's a fucking cocksucker.

14:20.567 --> 14:22.267
You didn't warm up, Jonah!
That's when you do your best.

14:22.367 --> 14:24.834
I don't fucking care.
I'm gonna get that cunt back.

14:24.934 --> 14:26.567
Yeah, you gotta
get him back, Jonah.

14:26.667 --> 14:29.467
He's gonna pay for bagging me.
Get out, you fucking homo!

14:29.567 --> 14:31.367
Israel: Get out, Sir!
You're not allowed
in here, Sir!

14:31.467 --> 14:32.700
Listen, guys,
I just wanted to say

14:32.800 --> 14:34.767
incredible dancing out there,
all right?

14:34.867 --> 14:37.534
Don't worry about the haters.
I thought you did
really well, cuz.

14:37.634 --> 14:40.334
What's wrong with you, Sir?
You gay or what?
Manu: Yeah!

14:40.434 --> 14:42.234
No no, I just wanted--
Get out!
What the fuck, Sir?

14:42.334 --> 14:43.667
I'm gonna
fucking report you!
Stop being...

14:43.767 --> 14:45.267
You're gonna get sacked
for coming in here.

14:45.367 --> 14:47.267
Okay, look, I know you're
probably angry right now,

14:47.367 --> 14:49.000
and I heard what
that Year 12 guy said,
all right?

14:49.100 --> 14:51.967
Totally uncalled for.
But my advice is

14:52.067 --> 14:53.900
don't retaliate, okay?
Be the bigger man.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.434
Kris, get the fuck outta here!
I don't care what
you have to say!

14:56.534 --> 14:58.167
Go fucking pray
or some shit.

14:58.267 --> 15:00.134
All right, all right.
Stop being
a fucking gaylord.

15:00.234 --> 15:02.334
Okay.
Stop perving on us!

15:02.434 --> 15:04.567
Stupid faggot.
Manu:
He's an f'ing homo.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.634
I fucking hate that guy.
He was fully trying
to check my dick out, man.

15:06.734 --> 15:09.767
How are we gonna get
Graydon back?
I don't know.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.500
Gotta do something bad.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.000
We could do
pee bombs, siana.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.534
I got water balloons
in my locker.

15:14.634 --> 15:15.900
Manu: Yeah, throw 'em
Israel: That'd be good.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.567
I could dack him
in front of everyone.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.434
No, I don't wanna see
his ranga butt.

15:19.534 --> 15:22.234
I gotta think
of something good, boys.

15:22.334 --> 15:24.634
Something that's really
gonna piss him off.

15:26.767 --> 15:29.067
Manu: I wanted to do this.
Sonny: Harder.

15:29.167 --> 15:30.900
No, can't touch it.
What is it?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.867
Don't know.
( boys laugh )

15:32.967 --> 15:34.734
Oh shit, man.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.267
Hey hey,
it's working, boys.

15:36.367 --> 15:39.134
It's full-on
like on fire, bro.
Yeah.

15:39.234 --> 15:40.834
Holy fuck.
It's gonna work.
It's melting.

15:40.934 --> 15:42.567
Hey, Jonah, Jonah.
Miss Hunt, Miss Hunt,
Miss Hunt.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.267
Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
Uh, what are
you boys up to?

15:45.367 --> 15:47.900
Uh, nothing.
It's just an assignment, Miss.
Metalwork.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.300
Yeah, metalwork.
Yeah.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.334
And Mr. Joseph knows
about this?

15:51.434 --> 15:53.167
Yeah, sure does, Miss.
Sure does.

15:53.267 --> 15:55.367
Give me a hug, Miss.
Okay. Yeah.

15:55.467 --> 15:57.534
Love you, Miss.
Okay. Thanks, Jonah.

15:57.634 --> 15:59.434
All right, I'll see
you boys last period.
Yeah, bye. Bye.

15:59.534 --> 16:01.334
Look forward to seeing you
this afternoon, Miss!
See you, Miss!

16:01.434 --> 16:02.800
See you, Miss.
I like your skirt, Miss.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.367
I love you too, Miss.
It's very slimming on you.

16:04.467 --> 16:07.334
I love you too, Miss.
Can I have a hug?

16:07.434 --> 16:10.434
Have you gone mad?
( chattering )

16:10.534 --> 16:12.467
Wait, she's still there,
she's still there.
Keep going, keep going.

16:14.167 --> 16:15.234
She thinks
it's an assignment.

16:15.334 --> 16:17.467
( P.A. beeping )

16:17.567 --> 16:19.200
( chattering )

16:21.267 --> 16:23.200
Jonah:
Fuck. Look who it is.
He's coming.

16:23.300 --> 16:24.700
He's coming.
He's coming.
Oh shit.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.000
( chattering, laughing )

16:27.100 --> 16:28.700
Oh, he's coming.
Let's go, let's get him.

16:31.667 --> 16:33.334
What happened?

16:33.434 --> 16:35.900
I'm going straight
to the principal
with this shit, mate.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.567
You're fucked.
I didn't do anything.

16:37.667 --> 16:39.367
Yeah, maybe it was
really hot today
and it melted.

16:39.467 --> 16:40.734
( scoffs )
You're fucked.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.434
Maybe it was
your ranga head
that melted it.

16:42.534 --> 16:44.567
( boys laughing )
Fuck, shit!

16:46.700 --> 16:49.367
Let him go! Let him go,
you fucking ranga!
Hey hey hey hey!

16:49.467 --> 16:51.800
Get off him!
Get off him!
( shouting )

16:51.900 --> 16:54.200
Get off him!
It's not funny, mate.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.567
Let him go!
He didn't fucking do it!
Come here, dickhead.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.400
You're fucked,
you're a fucking--
( laughter )

16:59.500 --> 17:03.200
Sucked in!
Fuck off,
you fucking sickos!

17:04.200 --> 17:05.667
You've got
a ranga bottom!

17:05.767 --> 17:07.934
You're going down
for this shit, mate!
You're fucked!

17:08.034 --> 17:09.767
( shouts )
Fuck you!

17:09.867 --> 17:11.800
( rock music playing )

17:16.867 --> 17:18.567
Graydon:
Sir, they've damaged
school property

17:18.667 --> 17:20.100
and it's physical abuse.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.734
And I'm school captain
and a Year 12,

17:21.834 --> 17:24.134
so I think I should be treated
with a bit more respect, yeah?

17:24.234 --> 17:27.300
Stop waving your stupid
school captain badge

17:27.400 --> 17:28.567
in front of my face.
( boy chuckles )

17:28.667 --> 17:30.367
I'm not interested.
It's meaningless.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.600
Now from all reports,
you're the one

17:32.700 --> 17:35.200
that bullied
the shit out of Jonah
at this school dance thing.

17:35.300 --> 17:36.967
Yeah, he did.
Boys: He did, Sir.
He did, Sir.

17:37.067 --> 17:39.700
If that's the case,
you're no better than
these fucking idiots.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.967
I made a simple comment
about how he failed
at dancing, okay?

17:42.067 --> 17:43.100
I'm not a bully.
( boys chattering )

17:43.200 --> 17:44.200
You obviously hurt
his feelings, mate.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.167
Now I've told you before:

17:46.267 --> 17:47.867
don't mess
with these A.D.D. kids.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.400
Yeah, don't fuck with us.
Now are you sure
that it was Jonah

17:50.500 --> 17:52.534
that welded your locker shut?
Because you say you didn't.
Is that right?

17:52.634 --> 17:55.134
No, I didn't do it, Sir.
I don't know who did it.

17:55.234 --> 17:57.067
It wasn't me.
He's lying right
to your face.

17:57.167 --> 17:58.934
It's got his "pussycat" tag
right on the front of it.
Jonah: Bullshit!

17:59.034 --> 18:00.234
What?
Jonah:
Shut up, ranga!

18:00.334 --> 18:02.800
We saw your Fanta pubes
anyway, so sucked in.

18:02.900 --> 18:05.534
( boys laugh )
Sir, can you tell him
to stop saying that?

18:05.634 --> 18:08.200
It's offending me.
Jonah, shut the fuck up.

18:08.300 --> 18:10.567
You obviously did do it.
Now listen, seriously.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.534
You should know better
than to provoke the shit

18:12.634 --> 18:14.434
out of a semi-retarded kid
like Jonah.

18:14.534 --> 18:16.067
Have a look at him!
He's clearly a fuckwit.
Don't fuck me.

18:16.167 --> 18:18.200
Yeah, he'll smash you.
I'm clearly a fuckwit.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.167
Don't fuck with me!
My A.D.D. pills

18:20.267 --> 18:22.234
make me crazy
and I'll fuck you up.

18:22.334 --> 18:24.134
This is too mu--
I'm going to principal
with this.

18:24.234 --> 18:26.067
He should be suspended,
and all these boys.

18:26.167 --> 18:28.500
Sit the fuck down now.
( boys laughing )

18:28.600 --> 18:31.234
Sit down!
Go, Sir!

18:31.334 --> 18:33.300
I'm the fucking teacher here!
I'll sort it out!

18:33.400 --> 18:35.900
I'll say who goes to what
and where and when!

18:36.000 --> 18:39.367
Understand?
He comes under
my jurisdiction.

18:39.467 --> 18:41.467
This stops right here,
right now.

18:41.567 --> 18:43.767
End of story.
( boys laughing )

18:43.867 --> 18:45.234
Balls.
He's got none.

18:45.334 --> 18:47.134
Jonah, let's talk about
how Graydon made you feel

18:47.234 --> 18:48.867
when he made those comments.

18:48.967 --> 18:51.467
He made me feel
like he's a homo.

18:51.567 --> 18:53.834
That's it.
I don't have time
for this shit.

18:53.934 --> 18:55.600
Look, you...
Shut up, Krissy!

18:55.700 --> 18:58.067
...go back to your room.
Mr. Fonua will walk you
over there.

18:58.167 --> 18:59.467
Now I'll sort out
these idiots

18:59.567 --> 19:01.134
and we'll get
your locker fixed.

19:01.234 --> 19:03.167
Jonah:
Yeah, piss off, ranga.
Ranga.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.067
Piss off, Year 12 ranga.
Ranga danga.

19:05.167 --> 19:06.967
See ya.
Shut up, shit pants.

19:07.067 --> 19:08.934
Why don't you get
your teacher's aide to go
and change your dirty nappy?

19:09.034 --> 19:10.767
Enjoy getting your books
out of your locker,

19:10.867 --> 19:12.434
because you can't
'cause it's welded.
( laughter )

19:12.534 --> 19:14.267
Shut up, Fob!
At least I can read books.
Hey hey.

19:14.367 --> 19:15.934
That's enough
of the racist thing, mate!

19:16.034 --> 19:18.267
You've got a Fob
youth worker standing
right beside you.

19:18.367 --> 19:19.867
I think you're outnumbered.

19:19.967 --> 19:22.867
Graydon: Whatever.
Yeah. Apologize
for being racist, ranga!

19:22.967 --> 19:25.500
Why should I apologize?
Why don't you stop damaging
school property?

19:25.600 --> 19:28.734
Apologize to my dick!
Joseph: Jonah, you shut
the fuck up, will you?

19:28.834 --> 19:30.400
You just sit there and think
about your actions.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.834
You're a fucking idiot.
Ranga, piss off.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.267
Go, Sir!
You called him a ranga!

19:34.367 --> 19:36.234
You're a legend!
( boys chatter )

19:36.334 --> 19:38.367
Don't try and charm
the shit out of me, mate.

19:38.467 --> 19:40.467
You're giving me
a fucking migraine today.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.100
Right, this is
what's gonna happen:

19:43.200 --> 19:44.367
you lot are going
to get an angle grinder

19:44.467 --> 19:46.500
and you're going
to fix that locker.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.200
And for the rest
of the week, you're gonna
stay back after class

19:48.300 --> 19:50.000
and you're gonna work...
What?

19:50.100 --> 19:51.834
Sonny:
That's fucked, Sir!
...in the horticultural center.

19:51.934 --> 19:53.900
Fucking laugh
that up, funny boy.
You're a shithead, Sir.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.334
Sonny:
He's a fricking ranga.
You wanna get suspended?

19:56.434 --> 19:57.900
Do you wanna go
and see the principal?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.967
Your dick wants
to get suspended.
Oh, it does, does it?

20:00.067 --> 20:01.834
( boys chatter )
Yeah. Yeah.
My dick?

20:01.934 --> 20:04.600
Jonah: It does!
Move! Do as you're
fucking told!

20:04.700 --> 20:07.100
You're mean.
Go on!
Fast as you can! Go!

20:07.200 --> 20:09.800
I'm going, Sir.
Sir, this is as fast
as I can get.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.634
Fucking homos.
This is my fastest.

20:11.734 --> 20:14.667
Get the fuck out the door!
Don't molest
my asshole, Sir!

20:14.767 --> 20:16.767
Manu: Don't touch him, Sir.
Don't chuck shit at me.

20:16.867 --> 20:19.667
Don't, Sir.
Sir, it could've
gone up my ass!

20:19.767 --> 20:21.500
Yeah!
You suck, Sir.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.734
*
Moses: I'm telling
the principal.

20:28.334 --> 20:31.067
( laughing, chattering )

20:33.400 --> 20:35.134
Jonah:
And when we fly over,

20:35.234 --> 20:37.367
you should go
premium economy.

20:37.467 --> 20:39.234
Moses:
I don't need
to go premium economy...

20:39.334 --> 20:40.634
That's a good one.
...'cause I'm only small.

20:40.734 --> 20:42.934
That means I can get
a small seat in economy

20:43.034 --> 20:45.434
and you can go first class,
which saves us money
to spend in America.

20:45.534 --> 20:47.600
Oh yeah.
And first class is good,

20:47.700 --> 20:49.900
'cause you get
a massage from the ladies

20:50.000 --> 20:51.567
and they are hotter ones.
In first class,

20:51.667 --> 20:53.667
air hostesses
are always hotter.

20:53.767 --> 20:56.300
On Qantas?
Yup.

20:57.967 --> 20:59.900
And in economy,
it's shit,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.467
because sometimes
people die on planes

21:02.567 --> 21:04.334
and they put 'em
in a seat next to you,

21:04.434 --> 21:06.067
so you gotta sit
next to a dead person.

21:06.167 --> 21:07.667
I don't care.
That'd be cool.

21:07.767 --> 21:11.400
Moses and Jonah, am I seeing
any actual reading going on

21:11.500 --> 21:14.734
or just chatting?
iPad out and reading,
please, Moses.

21:14.834 --> 21:17.767
Jonah, you help him.
( mutters )
It's already out.

21:17.867 --> 21:19.600
I know.
She's an idiot.

21:19.700 --> 21:22.434
( Moses sniffles )
This is boring.

21:22.534 --> 21:25.834
Should we sing the song?
Yeah. Okay.

21:25.934 --> 21:27.467
Two...
Three, four...

21:27.567 --> 21:31.967
* Pretty island girl,
I wanna touch your booby *

21:32.067 --> 21:35.667
* Island girl,
let me touch your booby *

21:35.767 --> 21:38.000
* Pretty island girl,
I wanna touch your booby. *

21:38.100 --> 21:41.667
That's lovely, boys,
but this isn't Music.
It's Reading Partners.

21:41.767 --> 21:45.300
How much reading
have we done today?
I suck at reading, Miss.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.900
Don't wanna do it.
He sucks too.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.767
All right, well,
just see if you can
recognize any words for me.

21:53.334 --> 21:55.534
Sorry, Miss.
Sorry.

21:55.634 --> 21:59.067
We'll start reading, Miss.
Love you, Miss!

21:59.167 --> 22:02.900
Oi, Pooses!
Hey, Pooses!

22:03.000 --> 22:04.200
Jonah:
Fuck up, homo.

22:04.300 --> 22:06.167
It's Graydon's
little brother.

22:06.267 --> 22:08.234
Calls me "Pooses"
because I pooed my pants

22:08.334 --> 22:09.667
on the first day of term one.

22:09.767 --> 22:12.500
Ugh! What stinks?!

22:12.600 --> 22:15.434
Fuck up, ranga,
or I'll bash you!

22:15.534 --> 22:18.500
You picked on my brother,
so I can pick on yours!

22:18.600 --> 22:20.367
Want me to beat
the shit out of you?

22:20.467 --> 22:24.400
I'm in Year 9.
I can take on
a Year 7 any day.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.934
You wanna go back
in the locker again?
Teacher: Oi, be nice.

22:27.034 --> 22:28.634
And no language.

22:28.734 --> 22:29.767
( drums beat )

22:31.234 --> 22:33.134
Make sure you hold onto it.
Let's go.

22:33.234 --> 22:35.300
Oi, where you lot going?

22:35.400 --> 22:36.734
Manu:
Back in five--
10 minutes, Sir.

22:36.834 --> 22:39.267
Straight to the wash-up area
and back! No fucking around!

22:39.367 --> 22:41.267
Sir, we have to go
to the bins first,
so we might take ages!

22:41.367 --> 22:43.234
Joseph:
You can pretty much define

22:43.334 --> 22:45.734
the Laz House kids
in two categories.
( chattering )

22:45.834 --> 22:48.967
You've got your dumb,
and you've got your dumb
and annoying.

22:49.067 --> 22:51.500
Jonah is definitely
dumb and annoying.

22:51.600 --> 22:54.000
Excuse me, Miss.
Woman: Yes, boys?

22:54.100 --> 22:56.167
Mr. Joseph needs
to see some boys.

22:56.267 --> 22:59.134
Graydon's brother.
That one.

22:59.234 --> 23:01.467
Jonah:
It's urgent, Miss.
This one here

23:01.567 --> 23:04.534
and that one there.
Come with us, boys.
Yup.

23:04.634 --> 23:06.700
Joseph:
I'm in a pretty tricky
position at the moment.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.600
I need to draw as little
attention as possible...
Hurry up.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.767
...to the issues
that Jonah's causing.
Thanks, Miss!

23:11.867 --> 23:13.600
( chattering )

23:13.700 --> 23:17.267
Obviously, I don't want
Laz House closed down.

23:17.367 --> 23:19.267
I think
it does good, but...

23:19.367 --> 23:21.600
it's gonna be
pretty difficult to work out.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.667
But slow and steady,

23:23.767 --> 23:25.600
you know,
we'll get there.

23:25.700 --> 23:29.767
( knocks )
I haven't reached
my ultimate level of rage yet.

23:29.867 --> 23:32.334
When I do, they normally
don't fuck with me again.

23:32.434 --> 23:34.534
I don't know your names,
but that girl there

23:34.634 --> 23:36.067
that one there.

23:36.167 --> 23:39.134
That one.
Him and this kid here.

23:39.234 --> 23:41.067
Get up, come with us.
Hurry up.

23:41.167 --> 23:42.134
Jonah:
Gotta go urgently.

23:42.234 --> 23:43.900
Here, hurry up.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.067
Kool Kris:
I enjoy a challenge, I do.

23:46.167 --> 23:49.400
And I think Jonah
from Lazarus House...
( chattering )

23:49.500 --> 23:51.934
...is definitely a challenge,
if ever there was one.

23:52.034 --> 23:54.600
*
But it should be
interesting.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.967
Hurry up!
And Jonah, I know,
can seem pretty full-on,

23:58.067 --> 24:01.534
but there's something
about him that actually
intrigues me,

24:01.634 --> 24:03.534
so I'm keen
to figure out what that is.

24:03.634 --> 24:05.734
All right,
I'm feeling it, guys.
Some mint dancing going on.

24:05.834 --> 24:07.400
Kool Kris:
Yeah, I've got a good feeling
I'm gonna love it here.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.867
Yeah, I'm ready to rock it,

24:08.967 --> 24:12.234
and Jonah is
gonna be my mission.

24:12.334 --> 24:13.800
I'm gonna work
that kid out.

24:13.900 --> 24:17.234
Jonah:
All rangas into the goal!
Hurry up, boys, quickly!

24:17.334 --> 24:18.900
All rangas in!
Kyton:
Why the fuck are we here?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.867
Sonny:
I'm sorry, we're not
answering any questions.

24:20.967 --> 24:22.500
It's a Laz House
anger management task.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.300
You've gotta do it.
All rangas in.
Get in. Get in.

24:25.400 --> 24:26.767
Stay here.

24:26.867 --> 24:28.934
Kyton:
We don't have to do
what you fucking say.

24:29.034 --> 24:30.967
Come here, come here.
Get in.

24:31.067 --> 24:33.434
Get in. Get in.

24:33.534 --> 24:37.034
All rangas in.
Okay, tie up the sides, boys.

24:37.134 --> 24:41.000
Action! This is
a Fobba-liscious bully video.

24:41.100 --> 24:42.200
Subscribe to us online.
Fobba-liscious.

24:42.300 --> 24:43.534
This is called
"The Ranga Roundup

24:43.634 --> 24:45.500
with Year 7 homo
eating dog shit."

24:45.600 --> 24:47.600
Where's the dog shit?
Give me this dog shit.
Hurry up.

24:47.700 --> 24:48.967
Graydon's
little brother,
come here.

24:49.067 --> 24:50.200
You're gonna eat
dog shit.

24:50.300 --> 24:51.934
Come here.
Fuck off.
Go go go.

24:52.034 --> 24:53.234
Hurry up.
Fuck off!

24:53.334 --> 24:55.067
Come to the camera.
Fuck off!
Hurry up!

24:55.167 --> 24:56.867
Come here!
Take it!
( clamoring )

24:56.967 --> 24:58.100
Eat it!
No!

24:58.200 --> 24:59.767
Eat the dog shit!
Eat it!

Fuck off!
Eat it!

25:01.067 --> 25:02.500

25:02.600 --> 25:05.300
Jonah!
You fucking idiot!
Fuck. Shit. Fuck.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.767
Oh shit.
Mr. Joseph.
Fuck.

25:06.867 --> 25:09.300
Sorry, Sir!
It was a joke!

25:09.400 --> 25:11.500
I'll get your ass
for this!

25:22.134 --> 25:23.400
Now you're fucked!
I'm gonna call him!

25:23.500 --> 25:25.134
I wouldn't want to be
your ass tonight, boy!

25:25.234 --> 25:26.534
Manu:
Jonah, you're gonna
get in trouble.

25:26.634 --> 25:28.767
Sir, I love you!
I love you, Sir!

25:28.867 --> 25:31.567
Get your asses over here
and help me get them out,

25:31.667 --> 25:33.534
you fucking idiots!

25:34.467 --> 25:35.967
Sir!

25:36.067 --> 25:38.467
Do it yourself, Sir!

25:38.567 --> 25:41.400
I love you, Sir!
Please don't call my dad!

25:43.434 --> 25:44.634

Jonah: Melody!

25:44.734 --> 25:46.734
( chuckles )
She likes you, siana.
Think so?

25:46.834 --> 25:48.167
I wanted
to ask you something.

25:48.267 --> 25:49.500
Would I be able
to papier-mâché you?

25:49.600 --> 25:51.367
Why the fuck would
you want to do that?

25:51.467 --> 25:53.400
Stop trying
to touch my boobs!
I didn't--

25:53.500 --> 25:55.234
Hey, siana, need any help?
Don't fucking touch.

25:55.334 --> 25:57.667
Jonah:
Moses is obsessed
with the golden bowling ball.

25:57.767 --> 25:59.500
You're touching $10,000.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.867
The prize is
a trip to America.
How do we win it?

26:01.967 --> 26:05.234
( beatboxing )
* I wanna beat the shit out
of every motherfucker... *

26:05.334 --> 26:08.100
Whoa whoa whoa, hey.
Boys:
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.367
What did the nun say
to the priest?
"Shut up."

26:10.467 --> 26:12.434
( both laugh )
I like that one.

26:12.534 --> 26:13.934
Mr. Joseph tells me
you've been in trouble
with the law.

26:14.034 --> 26:15.667
Is that right?
What's up, dox?

26:15.767 --> 26:17.634
You guys wanna
do something that proves
to us that you're real men?

26:17.734 --> 26:20.000
Oh fuck.
Jonah!

26:20.100 --> 26:21.300
Shit, your dad's
shown up.
Oh, let's run!

26:21.400 --> 26:23.334
I'm gonna smack
your asshole!

26:23.434 --> 26:26.967
Yeah, I'm gonna kill
