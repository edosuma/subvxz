WEBVTT

00:02.334 --> 00:06.013
Cutie Mark Crusaders!
Cutie Mark Crusaders!

00:06.101 --> 00:07.756
Cutie Mark Crusaders!

00:07.844 --> 00:09.492
Cutie Mark Crusaders!

00:09.579 --> 00:11.562
We're at my house!

00:12.882 --> 00:14.897
I got my cutie mark!

00:14.984 --> 00:15.998
You did?

00:16.085 --> 00:17.767
That's great, Skeedaddle!

00:17.854 --> 00:19.736
Yeah! What's it for?

00:19.823 --> 00:21.000
Knot tying!

00:21.088 --> 00:23.453
And I never would've gotten it 
without all of you!

00:23.541 --> 00:26.023
Did we suggest
knot-tying?

00:26.278 --> 00:28.484
First, I tried sailing,
like you said.

00:28.626 --> 00:31.140
Next, I tried fishing,
like YOU said.

00:31.228 --> 00:34.601
Then I tried rowing, like you said. 
But my oar broke.

00:34.714 --> 00:37.179
So I used my fishing line
to tie it back together...

00:37.326 --> 00:39.148
AND I GOT MY CUTIE MARK!

00:39.259 --> 00:41.929
I can't wait to tell EVERYPONY!

00:43.972 --> 00:45.500
Yay! - Yeah! - Woohoo!

00:45.588 --> 00:47.093
Oh, how exciting!

00:47.181 --> 00:50.671
You three truly have a
gift for helping ponies.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.617
Aw, thanks, Aunt Holiday.

00:52.705 --> 00:55.121
But I'm not sure we can
take credit for this one.

00:55.209 --> 00:56.593
Of course, you can!

00:56.681 --> 00:58.729
You encouraged that
colt to try new things.

00:58.817 --> 01:02.164
And because you all believed
in him, he succeeded.

01:02.566 --> 01:04.546
I could use that kind of help.

01:06.642 --> 01:10.578
C'mon, Auntie Lofty.
You already HAVE your cutie mark.

01:10.666 --> 01:12.593
Lot of good it does me.

01:12.893 --> 01:15.750
I can't decide what
theme to give this quilt.

01:15.838 --> 01:17.697
I've run out of inspiration.

01:17.785 --> 01:20.187
How about apples?
Puppies? Kites!

01:20.319 --> 01:22.300
Or cotton candy? Or ballet!

01:22.474 --> 01:23.822
What about a Wonderbolt quilt?

01:23.910 --> 01:26.359
Ha ha! See? Leave
it to you three

01:26.447 --> 01:28.795
to come up with more ideas
than I've had in a year.

01:28.927 --> 01:30.937
Now that's talent!

01:33.601 --> 01:35.281
Goodness, we'd better get going

01:35.382 --> 01:36.718
or we'll miss our train home.

01:36.806 --> 01:39.522
I left you plenty of healthy
food for the weekend.

01:39.663 --> 01:41.645
And I left you cookies.

01:43.158 --> 01:46.054
The Cakes will stay with
you tonight, then Rarity,

01:46.142 --> 01:48.039
and Rainbow Dash after that.

01:48.127 --> 01:50.310
Remember, we're just a
few stops from Ponyville

01:50.398 --> 01:52.484
- if you need us.
- She knows, Holiday!

01:52.640 --> 01:54.375
See you next week, slugger.

01:54.586 --> 01:57.554
Bye, Aunt Holiday!
Bye, Auntie Lofty!

01:58.721 --> 02:00.970
Your aunts are so nice!

02:01.057 --> 02:03.216
Yeah!
It's really cool they watch you

02:03.304 --> 02:04.617
while your parents are gone.

02:04.705 --> 02:07.500
I know! I just wish
they lived closer.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.984
Nopony bakes like Auntie Lofty!

02:14.603 --> 02:16.852
They're coming home today!

02:16.940 --> 02:19.531

Episode Title:

02:59.705 --> 03:01.048
Today we're going to learn

03:01.135 --> 03:03.570
about the Pegasus
Weather Factory.

03:03.796 --> 03:06.671
Once everypony is
in their seats.

03:10.350 --> 03:14.546
The factory specializes in
snow, rain, sunshine, and...

03:14.715 --> 03:17.898
Ahem! Scootaloo.
May I help you?

03:18.217 --> 03:21.703
I just noticed
your erasers needed dusting!

03:26.908 --> 03:30.391
Why don't we hold off on the lesson
until after lunch?

03:30.510 --> 03:34.046
How about show and tell?
Does anypony have any...

03:34.134 --> 03:37.507
My parents are coming home
to Ponyville today!

03:37.634 --> 03:40.750
Wait. They don't live here?

03:40.930 --> 03:44.359
Nope. Their jobs are way
too important for that.

03:44.447 --> 03:47.929
They travel to the farthest,
most dangerous places

03:48.030 --> 03:51.984
in Equestria to study unknown
plants and fierce creatures.

03:52.218 --> 03:55.578
And what they learn helps
pony science and medicine!

03:55.674 --> 03:58.937
I'd go with them,
but it's too dangerous.

04:00.295 --> 04:04.156
Once, my mom had to
wing-wrestle a wyvern!

04:04.244 --> 04:07.265
And my dad got trapped
in a chimera's cave

04:07.353 --> 04:11.875
for three moons!
He still has the scars to prove it.

04:11.963 --> 04:13.140
Pffft!

04:13.243 --> 04:16.803
You're making that up.
Nopony has THAT kind of job.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:28.627 --> 04:30.375
It's a CRAGADILE!

04:36.391 --> 04:38.639
Easy there, Marshmallow.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.343
Time you were in your crate
for your nap!

04:45.760 --> 04:47.992
And that means now, mister!

04:56.861 --> 04:58.876
Mom! Dad!

05:00.266 --> 05:02.491
Still think she's
makin' it all up?

05:03.024 --> 05:04.632
Nuh-uh!

05:05.585 --> 05:11.171
Everypony, meet my parents:
Snap Shutter and Mane Allgood.

05:11.632 --> 05:13.570
Huh! Sorry to make such an entrance.

05:13.658 --> 05:15.741
Just brought back a few mates
from our last adventure.

05:15.828 --> 05:18.877
We couldn't wait another moment
to see Scootaloo!

05:18.979 --> 05:21.109
I hope we didn't
interrupt anything.

05:22.506 --> 05:26.156
No, I... think
class is dismissed.

05:30.124 --> 05:33.373
Crikey! You're nearly as
tall as me now, Scoot!

05:33.515 --> 05:34.996
Aw, c'mon, Dad.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.632
Oh, Scootaloo.
We missed you!

05:37.805 --> 05:41.046
Me too, Mom!
Did you get all my letters?

05:41.327 --> 05:43.140
And read them twenty times!

05:43.228 --> 05:45.710
But they're never as good as
the real thing.

05:45.992 --> 05:47.841
It's so good to see you.

05:47.952 --> 05:51.568
I say we celebrate
with ice cream sundaes!

05:51.740 --> 05:53.955
They don't have THOSE in the
jungle, that's for sure.

05:54.057 --> 05:56.537
Why don't you all come?
Our treat!

06:01.670 --> 06:02.849
And Princess Twilight said

06:02.937 --> 06:04.618
we're such good
friendship tutors,

06:04.672 --> 06:06.587
she might even let
us teach a class!

06:06.823 --> 06:08.170
Good on ya, Scoot!

06:08.258 --> 06:09.670
What an honor!

06:10.037 --> 06:12.240
I can give you a tour of the school
if you want!

06:12.328 --> 06:14.896
I mean, if you're staying
for a while this time.

06:15.013 --> 06:17.763
Oh, you'll be seeing
plenty of us.

06:18.113 --> 06:19.394
Really?

06:19.482 --> 06:22.269
Mm hm. Because we've
taken a new job assignment

06:22.357 --> 06:24.417
that will let ALL of us
live together.

06:24.528 --> 06:28.605
I can't believe it!
That's awesome!

06:28.848 --> 06:31.530
- All right, Scootaloo!
- Woo hoo!

06:31.618 --> 06:34.644
We never planned to be away for
so long in the first place.

06:34.732 --> 06:36.413
We just kept discovering things

06:36.501 --> 06:39.224
that could help
Equestria, and nopony else

06:39.312 --> 06:41.613
had the experience
to finish our job.

06:41.701 --> 06:44.558
But with all that's happened
lately: Sombra's return,

06:44.646 --> 06:46.695
the destruction of
the Tree of Harmony,

06:46.783 --> 06:49.518
we decided our family
should be together.

06:52.192 --> 06:55.230
This is the best day of my life.

06:55.439 --> 06:57.136
We'll stay in town
for the weekend

06:57.224 --> 06:58.499
so you can pack
your things.

06:58.587 --> 07:00.159
Wait...
WHAT?

07:00.247 --> 07:02.488
We're all moving
to Shirelanka.

07:02.598 --> 07:03.979
That's where our
new job is.

07:04.067 --> 07:06.983
But...
my friends are in Ponyville!

07:07.296 --> 07:08.691
You can come back
and visit 'em.

07:08.779 --> 07:11.520
Or they can take the train to us.
There's one every month.

07:11.708 --> 07:13.457
But Scootaloo can't leave!

07:13.545 --> 07:15.848
We've been together
our whole lives!

07:16.263 --> 07:18.559
It'll be a big
change for everypony.

07:18.647 --> 07:22.364
But it'll be a good change!
Give it time; you'll see.

07:22.452 --> 07:24.231
The only thing I see...

07:24.319 --> 07:28.363
is the end of the
Cutie Mark Crusaders!

07:37.368 --> 07:39.715
I now call our last ever

07:39.803 --> 07:42.252
Cutie Mark Crusader
meeting to order.

07:42.350 --> 07:46.723
First item of business, cry!

07:54.564 --> 07:58.080
You can't let the blank flanks
down just cause I'm gone.

07:58.301 --> 08:01.824
You gotta keep being
CMCs without me!

08:02.340 --> 08:06.152
How? There's only two of us.

08:06.448 --> 08:09.431
Maybe you can find
a replacement for me.

08:09.619 --> 08:13.636
No, we can't!
You're the only you!

08:13.724 --> 08:15.660
Nothin's gonna be the same.

08:15.753 --> 08:19.074
Who's gonna ride their scooter
ahead of us everywhere we go?

08:19.162 --> 08:21.621
Or... or put on plays with us?

08:21.709 --> 08:26.393
Or go camping with us?
Or just... hang out with us?

08:26.481 --> 08:31.649
Well, it's worse for me!
I have to say goodbye to BOTH of you!

08:32.760 --> 08:34.417
Guess who just got
three front-row tickets

08:34.505 --> 08:36.190
to the Wonderbolts
show next week?

08:41.145 --> 08:44.275
Uh, that is NOT the reaction
I was expecting.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.690
Thanks for the tickets, Rainbow Dash.
But I can't go.

08:48.857 --> 08:50.432
Her parents are making
her move

08:50.520 --> 08:52.721
super far away
from Ponyville!

08:52.809 --> 08:56.510
What? No way!
Scootaloo belongs HERE!

08:56.770 --> 09:01.947
And now we'll probably never
see her again! It's HOPELESS!

09:04.319 --> 09:05.893
Whoa whoa whoa.

09:06.093 --> 09:09.182
I cannot believe you're
giving up so easily!

09:09.275 --> 09:11.565
You're the Cutie
Mark Crusaders!

09:11.653 --> 09:13.947
Solving tough problems
is what you do!

09:15.042 --> 09:18.487
We are pretty good
at coming up with ideas.

09:18.575 --> 09:21.524
That's right!
When we work together,

09:21.612 --> 09:22.869
we're unstoppable!

09:22.957 --> 09:25.338
I can't believe
we didn't think of it before!

09:25.426 --> 09:27.416
It's list time, y'all!

09:28.918 --> 09:30.072
First question,

09:30.160 --> 09:32.709
why do Scootaloo's parents
want to move to Shirelanka?

09:32.863 --> 09:34.182
That's where their new job is.

09:35.194 --> 09:38.080
What if we get
them a job here instead?

09:38.168 --> 09:41.033
Yeah!
They like dangerous creatures, right?

09:41.383 --> 09:43.408
We gotta have some of those
around here.

09:43.496 --> 09:45.291
Like... Timberwolves!

09:45.438 --> 09:48.979
Dad knows all about those.
And cockatrices, and bugbears.

09:49.067 --> 09:51.588
They only study
super-rare animals.

09:51.676 --> 09:54.447
Then maybe
we need to give them an animal

09:54.535 --> 09:56.432
nopony's ever heard of!

09:56.520 --> 09:59.002
Uh then
how would we hear about it?

09:59.132 --> 10:02.291
Because we're making it up!
C'mon!

10:04.434 --> 10:07.471
So... you want these
tickets, or...?

10:07.576 --> 10:10.088
♪♪

10:10.176 --> 10:12.447
This is what I
wanted to show you!

10:12.535 --> 10:17.268
The tracks of the mysterious
Everfree Banshee Beast.

10:17.451 --> 10:21.338
Hmm, they're like
nothing I've ever seen.

10:21.517 --> 10:25.744
Legend says
it has five claws and three wings,

10:25.832 --> 10:29.315
and it's super-dangerous
if you get close.

10:29.808 --> 10:33.322
If only somepony
could prove it exists!

10:33.726 --> 10:37.276
Hmm. Easy enough.
We'll follow the spoor.

10:41.337 --> 10:43.799
I think
I heard something this way!

10:44.062 --> 10:49.338
<i>♪ ♪</i>

10:54.742 --> 10:57.026
So the plan is,
we let 'em get a picture,

10:57.114 --> 10:58.737
then we hide again, right?

11:04.671 --> 11:07.541
Now the plan is run!

11:14.312 --> 11:15.507
Whoa!

11:19.221 --> 11:22.047
Heh-heh. Guess you
solved the mystery.

11:22.328 --> 11:24.961
We'd better get back.
There's a lot to get ready

11:25.049 --> 11:27.110
before the house goes
up for sale tomorrow.

11:32.157 --> 11:33.805
Don't worry, Scootaloo.

11:33.893 --> 11:36.241
We have a NEW plan to
keep you in Ponyville.

11:36.336 --> 11:39.219
We just gotta show your
parents we're a set of three!

11:39.383 --> 11:41.946
Then they'll have to let you
stay here with us!

11:55.963 --> 11:58.157
Scoot? Are these yours?

12:01.184 --> 12:02.868
Yeah, thanks, Dad.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.258
We're sending them to
the Pony Book of Records.

12:05.466 --> 12:07.969
We're the only three
ponies in Equestria

12:08.057 --> 12:09.188
with the SAME
cutie mark!

12:09.276 --> 12:11.375
The chances of that
are so rare,

12:11.463 --> 12:14.657
it means we belong together,
forever!

12:15.291 --> 12:17.813
Yeah, but you don't have
the same cutie mark.

12:18.305 --> 12:21.094
Uh, sure we do! Look!

12:21.239 --> 12:23.868
Well, this part is the same,
but the picture inside,

12:23.956 --> 12:25.313
each of these is different.

12:25.429 --> 12:27.177
I think it means
you'll stay best friends,

12:27.265 --> 12:30.016
no matter where you go.
And that's really special.

12:30.526 --> 12:34.969
But... we...
How do you argue with that?

12:40.995 --> 12:44.571
All right, y'all.
Time to take things up a notch.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.227
With prune juice?

12:49.315 --> 12:51.864
It's a potion I mixed up
from Zecora's book!

12:52.014 --> 12:54.204
Prune is only ONE
of the ingredients.

12:54.292 --> 12:55.633
What's it do?

12:57.138 --> 13:01.485
On this potion, please depend.
Any separation, mend.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.914
Friends together
till the end!

13:04.002 --> 13:05.805
We just gotta
dab a little on our hooves.

13:05.893 --> 13:07.440
Sounds perfect, right?

13:07.528 --> 13:09.143
Better than perfect!

13:09.487 --> 13:12.489
♪♪

13:15.926 --> 13:18.422
Is something supposed to happen?

13:21.979 --> 13:24.500
Is THIS the something
that's supposed to happen?

13:24.588 --> 13:26.618
The book didn't really say.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.488
Whoa!

13:30.229 --> 13:31.943
Thanks for trying,
Apple Bloom.

13:32.031 --> 13:33.603
But I might as
well face it.

13:33.696 --> 13:35.994
I'm gonna have to
leave Ponyville.

13:37.019 --> 13:38.900
Don't give up, Scootaloo.

13:38.988 --> 13:41.041
This just gave me
an even BETTER idea

13:41.129 --> 13:43.314
how to keep you here.
C'mon!

13:43.402 --> 13:44.580
Whoa!

13:46.424 --> 13:50.267
Maybe we'd better see Zecora
about fixing this first.

13:53.721 --> 13:55.064
We're running out of time.

14:00.025 --> 14:02.119
This HAS to work!

14:03.055 --> 14:05.956
Scootaloo?
I know you're having fun with your friends,

14:06.044 --> 14:08.459
but we need to get all our
things to the station.

14:08.569 --> 14:10.284
We can't miss tomorrow's train.

14:10.395 --> 14:12.029
It's the only one for a month.

14:13.736 --> 14:16.219
Then you'll just have
to go without me!

14:16.666 --> 14:19.041
I'm staying with the CMCs!

14:19.219 --> 14:21.166
We are chained to this post!

14:21.254 --> 14:25.158
And nuthin' and nopony is
gonna move us, no matter...

14:25.998 --> 14:27.431
What.

14:30.992 --> 14:32.939
We just sold the house, Scoot.

14:33.126 --> 14:34.869
I know this is hard
to accept, but...

14:34.957 --> 14:38.439
It's more than hard!
It's not fair!

14:38.527 --> 14:41.627
You're making me pick between
my family and my friends.

14:41.835 --> 14:45.072
Oh, Scootaloo.
Moving away won't stop you three

14:45.160 --> 14:47.877
from caring about each other.
Why don't you sleep over

14:47.965 --> 14:49.822
with Sweetie Belle and
Apple Bloom tonight?

14:49.910 --> 14:52.533
It'll give you a chance
to say a real goodbye.

14:52.853 --> 14:55.353
But I don't WANT to say goodbye!

14:55.924 --> 14:57.781
You're changing my whole life

14:57.869 --> 15:00.923
without even asking how I feel!

15:11.338 --> 15:12.908
Scootaloo!

15:13.539 --> 15:14.892
Where are you going?

15:15.027 --> 15:17.955
To stay with my aunts.
You heard my parents!

15:18.172 --> 15:20.721
There isn't another train
to Shirelanka for a month.

15:20.997 --> 15:24.033
If I'm not on it,
they'll have to go without me.

15:24.518 --> 15:26.549
Then we're comin' with ya!

15:27.121 --> 15:29.814
Are you sure?
I don't want to get you in trouble.

15:29.926 --> 15:31.072
Rarity won't be mad.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.369
Applejack neither!

15:32.457 --> 15:34.947
I bet she'd do the same
thing for her friends.

15:35.525 --> 15:37.707
You're the best, you know that?

15:37.919 --> 15:39.366
WE'RE the best.

15:39.454 --> 15:40.702
Together!

15:50.163 --> 15:53.947
Scootaloo!
What a nice surprise!

15:54.284 --> 15:56.900
And I've got a surprise for you!

15:58.869 --> 16:01.785
You three inspired me
to finish my quilt.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.619
See? It's Cutie Mark
Crusader themed!

16:04.865 --> 16:08.048
We love hearing stories about
all the ponies you've helped.

16:08.143 --> 16:12.252
So Lofty decided to celebrate
the special job you three do!

16:14.803 --> 16:17.642
It's still a work
in progress.

16:18.789 --> 16:21.738
It's not your quilt we're
sad about, Auntie Lofty.

16:22.044 --> 16:23.625
Mom and Dad are back.

16:23.713 --> 16:26.877
And they're making me move
to Shirelanka with them!

16:27.174 --> 16:30.124
Snap and Mane are back?
They didn't tell me that!

16:30.212 --> 16:32.297
Oh. I think the
mailpony delivered

16:32.385 --> 16:34.010
your letter to my house.

16:37.769 --> 16:41.556
I love my family!
But I love being with my friends, too.

16:41.747 --> 16:43.603
I don't want to have to choose.

16:43.691 --> 16:45.206
Well then, why
don't your parents

16:45.294 --> 16:46.916
just stay in Ponyville?

16:47.721 --> 16:49.963
Their job is too important.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.330
That's it!

16:51.418 --> 16:53.333
Is this another
potion idea?

16:53.421 --> 16:57.336
No! Scootaloo's parents are
the only ponies in Equestria

16:57.424 --> 16:59.441
that can do what they do, right?

16:59.855 --> 17:01.088
Right.

17:01.230 --> 17:05.135
Well, so are we! Our
cutie marks prove it!

17:05.361 --> 17:09.912
Yeah! Our job is to help other
ponies find their purpose!

17:10.000 --> 17:13.884
And nopony else can do that!
So, if my parents split us up,

17:13.972 --> 17:17.064
it'd be just as bad as
them quitting their jobs!

17:17.239 --> 17:18.493
Woohoo!

17:20.469 --> 17:22.821
Now how do we explain that
to 'em?

17:22.910 --> 17:25.713
Oh,
you don't have to explain it.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.548
THEY will.

17:29.973 --> 17:31.988
Feeling better, Scootaloo?

17:32.076 --> 17:33.400
A little.

17:33.488 --> 17:35.705
I just wanna show you
something before we go.

17:35.921 --> 17:39.314
All right, but let's make it swift.
That train won't wait.

17:43.808 --> 17:45.890
Sweet Celestia's
slippers!

17:45.978 --> 17:47.588
What is all this?

17:50.262 --> 17:53.044
It's Cutie Mark Crusader
Appreciation Day!

17:53.132 --> 17:55.892
But we couldn't start
without all of them here!

17:59.248 --> 18:07.248
CMCs! CMCs! CMCs!
CMCs! CMCs! CMCs

18:08.583 --> 18:11.267
These three ponies
share a rare ability

18:11.392 --> 18:13.841
to help others
find their true purpose.

18:13.929 --> 18:17.679
It's a job only they can do,
and only together.

18:17.773 --> 18:19.588
That sounds familiar.

18:19.676 --> 18:21.724
In honor of all
they have done

18:21.812 --> 18:24.528
and continue to do for
the ponies of this town,

18:24.616 --> 18:27.353
I would like to present
the Cutie Mark Crusaders

18:27.483 --> 18:30.408
with a three-handled
key to the city!

18:42.583 --> 18:44.260
A full Wonderbolt
salute?

18:44.498 --> 18:46.931
Oh, I'm not sure you know
just how important

18:47.019 --> 18:49.001
Scootaloo and her friends
are, little brother!

18:49.089 --> 18:50.924
But you're about to find out.

18:51.847 --> 18:54.763
The CMCs used their free time
to set up a camp

18:54.851 --> 18:57.658
to help us blank flanks
find our cutie marks.

18:57.864 --> 19:00.746
The Cutie Mark Crusaders
see the best in everypony.

19:00.865 --> 19:03.385
Even when that pony can't see it
in themselves.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.994
Well, I'll be a
three-tailed bandicoot.

19:06.082 --> 19:08.642
I had no idea how important
Scoot's club was.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.663
Oh, it's way more
than just a club.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.232
The CMCs have made a difference

19:13.320 --> 19:15.056
for everypony here.

19:15.144 --> 19:18.961
And not just ponies!
They help everycreature.

19:19.182 --> 19:20.752
Whether it's encouraging others

19:20.840 --> 19:22.625
to discover their
special talent.

19:24.144 --> 19:27.460
Or inspiring them to do
what's in their heart.

19:27.658 --> 19:29.439
These three fillies
offer the town

19:29.527 --> 19:31.283
something no other pony can.

19:39.981 --> 19:45.697
No way! After all that,
you're still gonna make her leave?

19:46.073 --> 19:48.213
We just want
what's best for Scootaloo.

19:48.301 --> 19:52.416
And until now...
we thought we knew what that was.

19:53.902 --> 19:56.484
Turns out,
you're just like us, Scoot.

19:56.572 --> 19:59.521
You have an important
job that only you can do.

19:59.700 --> 20:02.564
You love it,
and it helps all of Equestria.

20:04.053 --> 20:07.382
Sometimes that means missing
out on other things you love.

20:07.470 --> 20:10.181
Like watching our
daughter grow into a pony

20:10.269 --> 20:12.010
we're very proud of.

20:12.098 --> 20:14.279
Which is a long way to say:

20:14.374 --> 20:17.517
Scoot, if you want to stay,
we understand.

20:19.304 --> 20:24.377
Really? Thanks, Dad.
Thanks, Mom!

20:30.910 --> 20:34.392
Oh, sweetie.
I'm just sorry we didn't realize it sooner.

20:34.480 --> 20:37.767
Our work is our life's purpose.
We could never quit.

20:37.855 --> 20:40.658
So there's no way
we could ask you to do the same.

20:41.912 --> 20:43.414
Maybe you should've
thought of that

20:43.502 --> 20:45.314
BEFORE you sold
the house.

20:46.138 --> 20:48.291
Lofty,
don't tease my brother!

20:48.386 --> 20:50.787
We already have
a solution worked out.

20:52.522 --> 20:55.705
Since the CMCs make
Ponyville such a nice place,

20:55.901 --> 20:57.591
we've decided to move here.

20:57.679 --> 21:00.629
You can live with us, Scootaloo.
If you'd like.

21:00.887 --> 21:03.662
That would be amazing!

21:04.256 --> 21:06.138
Will you...
still come and visit?

21:06.294 --> 21:07.419
Of course!

21:07.507 --> 21:10.123
Rabid bugbears
couldn't keep us away.

21:12.484 --> 21:15.623
You get to stay here!
You get to stay here!

21:15.711 --> 21:17.435
You get to stay here!

21:19.242 --> 21:22.677
Uh, you are staying here,
right?

21:22.765 --> 21:26.675
Are you kidding?
CMCs forever!

21:26.763 --> 21:28.426
Woohoo!
