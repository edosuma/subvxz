00:58.738 --> 01:01.411
You can do this.
Oh.

01:01.479 --> 01:04.154
Mm.
One...

01:04.221 --> 01:06.328
Two...

01:14.120 --> 01:16.125
Wait a second, wait a second.
I came this way.

01:16.193 --> 01:17.228
What?

01:17.229 --> 01:18.498
I recognize
those mountains

01:18.499 --> 01:20.399
From when I was
lost in the desert.

01:21.744 --> 01:23.983
They're blocking the road
because of the plane.

01:24.050 --> 01:26.222
Of course.
No, that's where we landed.

01:26.290 --> 01:28.190
Over that rise.
It's there.

01:30.568 --> 01:32.105
What's going on?

01:32.106 --> 01:34.913
Semi jackknifed and spilled
its payload onto the road.

01:34.981 --> 01:36.786
Some kind of
class four chemicals.

01:36.787 --> 01:38.687
Can't let anyone go through
till it's cleaned up.

01:38.725 --> 01:40.625
We're detouring everyone
to the 18.

01:40.629 --> 01:42.866
Thank you, officer.

01:42.934 --> 01:45.908
He's lying.
He's lying.

01:45.976 --> 01:47.245
You need to see
what's over that rise.

01:47.246 --> 01:48.482
So you'll believe me.
What, you just

01:48.483 --> 01:49.551
You want me to go
through the roadblock?

01:49.552 --> 01:50.722
Yes, please.
Honestly?

01:50.723 --> 01:52.092
Do you really think
that we would do that?

01:52.093 --> 01:53.529
Come on.
Well, then don't believe me!

01:53.530 --> 01:55.134
I really don't care.
Do whatever you want with me.

01:55.135 --> 01:56.972
Just please
find my girlfriend

01:56.973 --> 01:59.177
Or I think
they're gonna kill her.

02:01.484 --> 02:03.054
There's no
other way around it.

02:03.055 --> 02:04.955
Route 18 it is.

02:10.265 --> 02:11.668
I'm telling you,

02:11.669 --> 02:13.037
This isn't a chemical spill;
this is a coverup.

02:13.038 --> 02:16.411
The plane is right on
the other side of those hills.

04:09.219 --> 04:11.186
Okay, come on.

04:11.254 --> 04:14.188
Get out.
Slowly, slowly.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.358
Okay,
you're okay.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.260
Come on.

04:29.702 --> 04:32.570
Where's hobbes?

04:32.571 --> 04:34.438
He's dead.
Stay there, stay there.

04:34.439 --> 04:36.339
No, no.
No, no, no!

05:25.114 --> 05:26.347
You're awake.

05:26.348 --> 05:28.216
That's good.

05:28.217 --> 05:30.117
Here.

05:30.752 --> 05:31.752
It's aspirin.

05:31.753 --> 05:33.653
What'd you do to me?

05:35.289 --> 05:36.755
Ah.

05:36.756 --> 05:38.490
You got hurt.

05:38.491 --> 05:40.459
After the accident.

05:40.527 --> 05:42.127
And I couldn't bring
you to a hospital.

05:42.128 --> 05:44.529
So you...
You took me to a motel?

05:47.499 --> 05:51.133
Youyou need to give
yourself up and let me go now.

05:51.201 --> 05:53.535
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.437
Mr. Walker,
you saved my life.

05:56.505 --> 05:58.539
And you didn't have
to do that.

05:58.606 --> 06:01.307
But youyou need to realize
the kind of trouble you're in.

06:01.375 --> 06:03.076
You're already
wanted for murder

06:03.077 --> 06:05.046
And now you're
abducting a federal agent

06:05.113 --> 06:06.614
And holding her
against her will.

06:06.615 --> 06:08.182
Okay, I
do you understand that?

06:08.183 --> 06:10.018
I need your help.

06:10.019 --> 06:11.487
Okay?
My help?

06:11.488 --> 06:12.621
Yes.
Please, please...

06:12.622 --> 06:14.055
Tell me this
isn't about the plane.

06:14.056 --> 06:15.356
Yes, avias 514.

06:15.357 --> 06:17.492
Look, I know that it
sounds crazy.

06:17.559 --> 06:18.759
But I
yeah.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.660
It's true. It's

06:22.130 --> 06:24.297
Okay.

06:24.365 --> 06:26.065
You know what,
I can't waste any more time

06:26.066 --> 06:27.066
Trying to convince you.

06:27.067 --> 06:29.601
I have to find leila.
So...

06:29.669 --> 06:31.938
Here's what I've got, okay?

06:34.475 --> 06:36.342
She said her name
was vicky roberts.

06:36.343 --> 06:38.243
She's the one
who kidnapped my girlfriend.

06:38.245 --> 06:40.346
I need to find out
who she really is

06:40.414 --> 06:42.949
And I know the fbi has
facial recognition software.

06:43.016 --> 06:44.851
So I downloaded
a picture of her

06:44.852 --> 06:46.887
From my phone
into your netbook.

06:46.954 --> 06:48.854
I just need to connect
to the federal database

06:48.856 --> 06:50.189
So I can use it to I.D. Her.

06:50.190 --> 06:52.090
Not without my password.

06:53.859 --> 06:56.627
Do you know how
many people use "password"

06:56.695 --> 06:58.696
As their password?

06:58.763 --> 07:01.531
Yeah.

07:01.599 --> 07:03.265
I didn't.

07:03.266 --> 07:04.765
No, I know,
you used your cat's name

07:04.766 --> 07:06.100
Combined with your birthday.

07:06.101 --> 07:07.934
I had to look through
all your personal information

07:07.935 --> 07:09.135
When you were down,

07:09.136 --> 07:12.540
And you have 38 pictures
of chester in here.

07:14.410 --> 07:16.544
So...

07:16.612 --> 07:18.679
Okay, well...

07:18.747 --> 07:20.414
The password's not enough.

07:20.415 --> 07:23.216
You can'tyou can't
get to it remotely.

07:23.284 --> 07:24.717
It's an intranet.

07:24.718 --> 07:27.753
You have to access that system
from a secured hardline

07:27.821 --> 07:29.888
Inside the yuma field office.

07:29.956 --> 07:32.190
You can't connect
on a wifi.

07:34.426 --> 07:36.527
Well, that explains that.

07:38.563 --> 07:40.130
Sean...

07:40.131 --> 07:42.966
Sean, listen to me.

07:43.034 --> 07:45.135
Just let me go, and I'll forget
my abduction ever happened.

07:45.202 --> 07:46.703
I'll take you into custody

07:46.704 --> 07:48.871
And I promise you I will
get to the bottom of this.

07:50.341 --> 07:52.474
I I can't count on that.

07:52.542 --> 07:54.442
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

07:56.078 --> 07:57.477
I'm gonna get cleaned up,

07:57.478 --> 07:59.477
And then you're gonna
help me find vicky roberts.

08:45.548 --> 08:48.015
It's collier.
I'm being held by sean walker.

08:48.083 --> 08:50.184
Your suspect?
Same one.

08:50.252 --> 08:52.085
What about hobbes?
Hobbes is dead.

08:52.086 --> 08:55.288
What's your location?
I'm at the, uh...

08:55.356 --> 08:57.256
Pearblossom motel.
On our way.

09:09.049 --> 09:17.676
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

09:30.748 --> 09:33.617
You're a hard man
to get ahold of, blake.

09:33.684 --> 09:36.653
funny how a national emergency

09:36.721 --> 09:39.755
Exponentially increases
the amount of work.

09:39.822 --> 09:41.422
If you could make it brief,

09:41.423 --> 09:45.158
The president and I are
on our way to arizona.

09:45.226 --> 09:47.026
Well, then I'll
get right to the point.

09:47.027 --> 09:50.361
There were only a handful
of us who knew

09:50.429 --> 09:53.330
That the president was about
to announce to the public

09:53.397 --> 09:56.465
The presence of a 97
at inostranka.

09:56.533 --> 09:59.100
Meaning that's
the most likely motive

09:59.168 --> 10:01.836
For the attempted
assassination.

10:01.904 --> 10:03.804
To silence the president.

10:06.708 --> 10:08.944
I haven't been
sitting on my hands.

10:09.012 --> 10:10.980
The investigation's
already under way.

10:11.048 --> 10:13.416
Well,
I'm glad to hear that.

10:13.484 --> 10:15.384
Let me ask you a question.

10:16.954 --> 10:19.855
Who investigates
the investigator?

10:26.061 --> 10:28.996
Your concern has been noted.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.832
Thank you for bringing it

10:31.899 --> 10:36.035
To my attention,
vice president jarvis.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.541
Now that we know
the passengers are dead,

10:44.576 --> 10:47.510
We'll be making the final
adjustments to our cover story

10:47.578 --> 10:51.414
Namely that the plane stopped
transmitting flight data

10:51.482 --> 10:53.116
Over
the brazilian rain forest.

10:53.117 --> 10:55.017
Search parties will take days

10:55.052 --> 10:57.921
To reach the location
we've chosen for the crash.

10:57.988 --> 11:00.089
But we're already
staging the site with wreckage.

11:00.157 --> 11:03.259
We'll transport
the passengers' bodies there

11:03.327 --> 11:05.194
Once they've been treated

11:05.195 --> 11:07.095
To simulate
an airplane accident.

11:08.498 --> 11:10.532
The pilot of the plane,
michael buchanan,

11:10.600 --> 11:12.601
Has been positively
identified among the dead,

11:12.669 --> 11:16.037
So unfortunately,
he will not be answering

11:16.105 --> 11:18.273
Any questions about
the attempted assassination.

11:18.340 --> 11:21.075
But we are conducting
deep background checks

11:21.143 --> 11:24.678
And moving on all fronts
to find whoever's behind this.

11:24.746 --> 11:27.247
Their families...

11:27.315 --> 11:29.215
Will never know
what happened here.

11:29.283 --> 11:31.384
Well, mr. President,
with all due respect,

11:31.452 --> 11:34.187
Nothing we tell
or don't tell them

11:34.255 --> 11:36.556
Will change the fact that
their loved ones are dead.

11:36.624 --> 11:40.459
Our responsibility is
to protect the american public

11:40.527 --> 11:42.494
As a whole.
Protect them?

11:42.562 --> 11:45.996
From the truth?
We don't have a choice.

11:46.064 --> 11:48.630
Not when the truth
is that we've been infiltrated

11:48.698 --> 11:50.563
By an unknown number
of nonhumans

11:50.598 --> 11:52.965
That possess devastating
technological power

11:53.033 --> 11:54.400
That we have
no defense against.

11:54.401 --> 11:58.069
And who just murdered
a plane full of people.

11:58.136 --> 12:00.237
You're assuming
they were murdered.

12:00.305 --> 12:02.072
Could the deaths
have been the result

12:02.073 --> 12:04.974
Of whatever process
transported the plane here?

12:05.042 --> 12:06.276
Hmm?

12:06.277 --> 12:07.844
Agent lee has been
heading up the onsite.

12:07.845 --> 12:09.579
He's the best one
to answer that question.

12:09.580 --> 12:11.881
Mr. President.
Go ahead.

12:11.948 --> 12:14.216
Well, we're still trying
to determine what killed them.

12:14.284 --> 12:16.084
Whatever it was,
they saw it coming.

12:16.085 --> 12:18.019
It appears many of them
tried fleeing

12:18.087 --> 12:19.754
From the site
in the same direction.

12:19.755 --> 12:23.022
Running away from
some kind of singular threat.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.557
Others died displaying
defensive postures,

12:25.625 --> 12:27.492
Trying to shield
their spouses or children

12:27.493 --> 12:29.293
From whatever
threat they perceived.

12:29.294 --> 12:31.629
I want whoever did this.
I want them found.

12:31.697 --> 12:34.165
I've created
a special operations group

12:34.233 --> 12:36.233
With a specific goal
of finding the sleepers.

12:36.301 --> 12:39.336
But realistically,
it'll take time.

12:39.403 --> 12:41.404
We only just became
aware of their existence.

12:41.471 --> 12:43.839
Sophia knows?

12:43.907 --> 12:46.108
Based on your last
conversation with her,

12:46.175 --> 12:49.644
We have to assume she won't
share any information with us.

12:49.712 --> 12:51.612
Voluntarily.

12:51.613 --> 12:54.948
But if you're
willing to sign off

12:55.016 --> 12:56.950
On more aggressive
interrogation technique

12:57.018 --> 12:58.685
No. No.

12:58.686 --> 13:01.254
You'd be on safe
legal ground on this matter.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.222
Constitutional protections
would not extend

13:03.257 --> 13:04.357
End of discussion.

13:04.358 --> 13:06.392
I will not condone
the use of torture.

13:08.294 --> 13:11.897
And I have a better way.

13:23.873 --> 13:27.108
Before all of this,
you let me believe

13:27.176 --> 13:29.043
That you and the detainees
at inostranka

13:29.044 --> 13:31.178
Were the only ones
of your kind.

13:31.246 --> 13:33.046
I was angry...

13:33.047 --> 13:35.681
When I learned there were
others, that you lied to me.

13:35.749 --> 13:38.618
But I understood it, you thought
you had to protect them.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.753
Now...

13:40.821 --> 13:43.555
This is what they did,
sophia.

13:43.623 --> 13:46.458
They killed
everyone on that plane.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.561
183 men, women, and children.

13:49.629 --> 13:52.297
Look at them.

13:53.832 --> 13:56.734
You seem surprised.

13:56.802 --> 14:00.238
This wasn't
supposed to happen.

14:00.305 --> 14:03.373
That's all
you have to say?

14:03.441 --> 14:05.275
I'm sorry.

14:05.276 --> 14:07.110
No.

14:07.111 --> 14:09.312
I want you
to be more than sorry.

14:09.379 --> 14:12.648
I want you to help me find them
and bring them to justice.

14:12.716 --> 14:14.983
I can't defend this.

14:15.051 --> 14:18.320
But I won't betray my people.
I told you that.

14:18.387 --> 14:20.088
That was before
they committed mass murder.

14:20.089 --> 14:21.723
Now, I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

14:21.724 --> 14:24.125
You help me find them
and bring them to justice,

14:24.193 --> 14:27.161
And then maybe in time

14:27.229 --> 14:30.397
You and I can rebuild
what we had.

14:39.506 --> 14:42.841
Huh. At least you're confirming
I did the right thing.

14:42.909 --> 14:44.309
What do you mean?

14:44.310 --> 14:46.811
I had an announcement made
at inostranka.

14:46.879 --> 14:48.546
I'm offering a deal.

14:48.547 --> 14:50.614
Whoever can help me
find the people who did this

14:50.681 --> 14:53.850
Will be released permanently
to live free among us.

14:53.917 --> 14:55.951
It won't work.

14:56.018 --> 14:57.452
We will stand together.

14:57.453 --> 15:00.921
They've lived behind bars
for 66 years.

15:00.989 --> 15:03.256
And now they no longer
have any hope of release.

15:03.324 --> 15:05.257
Do you really think
out of all of your people

15:05.325 --> 15:07.426
One won't talk?

15:30.611 --> 15:32.511
Open it.
Yes, sir.

15:39.918 --> 15:42.052
William,
you have a message for me?

15:42.120 --> 15:44.020
For the president.

15:44.055 --> 15:45.757
I'll tell him everything.

15:45.758 --> 15:47.293
How many more of us
are out there,

15:47.294 --> 15:49.596
Where they're hiding,
what they've really been up to.

15:49.664 --> 15:51.098
All right?

15:51.099 --> 15:53.267
Now just get me
the hell outta here.

15:53.335 --> 15:55.602
Take him.
Yes, sir.

16:11.921 --> 16:14.355
Three, two, one.
Execute!

16:14.422 --> 16:16.856
In the bathroom.
He has my gun.

16:18.958 --> 16:20.191
Get out right now!
Hands where I can see them!

16:20.192 --> 16:22.092
Go.

16:23.562 --> 16:25.462
Clear!

16:27.564 --> 16:28.731
Looks like your guy's
in the wind.

16:28.732 --> 16:30.799
Angie, you all right?

16:30.867 --> 16:32.767
Yeah.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.506
The was aa roadblock.

16:38.507 --> 16:41.208
Cop said something
about a chemical spill.

16:41.276 --> 16:44.344
We stopped,
the rv behind us didn't.

16:44.412 --> 16:46.179
Some trucker
must've taken a shortcut.

16:46.180 --> 16:47.646
Not even supposed
to transport chemicals

16:47.647 --> 16:49.181
On route 95.

16:49.182 --> 16:52.216
Hobbes was dead
before the explosion.

16:52.284 --> 16:56.753
Walker could've run,
but he saved me.

17:08.595 --> 17:11.396
Ron, I should be out there
looking for walker.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.398
Every law enforcement agent
within a 50mile radius

17:13.465 --> 17:14.933
Is doing that.

17:14.934 --> 17:17.300
Only thing you're gonna
do right now is your debrief.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.269
And see a medic.

17:20.137 --> 17:21.871
He really believes
he was trying to stop a plane

17:21.872 --> 17:23.740
From crashing
into the president's compound.

17:23.741 --> 17:24.875
He had it all worked out.

17:24.876 --> 17:26.577
The pilot, his girlfriend,

17:26.578 --> 17:28.579
And how the plane
could've ended up in arizona.

17:28.647 --> 17:29.780
So he was delusional.

17:29.781 --> 17:31.481
Yeah, just...

17:31.482 --> 17:33.683
Really convinced
on what he was saying.

17:33.751 --> 17:35.651
They usually are.

18:00.210 --> 18:03.244
I'm just grateful you
weren't hurt, or worse.

18:03.312 --> 18:05.246
Guys like this, you never
know what they're capable of.

18:05.313 --> 18:08.047
Television:...That avias
airline flight 514

18:08.115 --> 18:10.282
Is reportedly lost over
the brazilian rain forest.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.350
Hey, who has the remote?
Turn this up.

18:12.418 --> 18:15.719
Television: Avias air flight 514
originated in miami.

18:15.787 --> 18:19.656
The faa has just confirmed
that the sao paulo bound 767...

18:19.723 --> 18:21.824
When did that happen?
Just came on, I think.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.892
Television: Carrying 183
passengers and crew members,

18:23.960 --> 18:26.395
Dropped off radars
over the brazilian jungle

18:26.462 --> 18:27.962
About an hour ago.

18:27.963 --> 18:30.797
Avias air released
a brief statement saying...

18:39.372 --> 18:41.307
That's it.
Avias flight 514.

18:41.375 --> 18:43.075
That's the flight walker
said he was on.

18:43.076 --> 18:44.376
Well, there's your answer.

18:44.377 --> 18:45.644
He heard about it
on the news

18:45.645 --> 18:47.379
Then he dropped it
in his fantasy.

18:47.380 --> 18:48.846
Textbook.
But they said that

18:48.847 --> 18:50.881
The plane
lost contact an hour ago.

18:50.949 --> 18:53.850
Walker told me
about this four hours ago.

18:53.918 --> 18:56.519
The reporter must
have the time frame wrong.

19:16.271 --> 19:18.171
Yes.

19:21.308 --> 19:23.742
Come on.

19:33.252 --> 19:34.686
Hey, calm down.

19:34.687 --> 19:36.621
We're almost there.

19:48.998 --> 19:50.365
Aw, man.

19:50.366 --> 19:54.103
Come on.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.750
You make a noise,
I'll kill you.

20:19.159 --> 20:20.893
You realize you're driving
with a busted taillight?

20:20.894 --> 20:22.227
No.

20:22.228 --> 20:24.062
Uh, actually
this is my friend's van.

20:24.063 --> 20:27.066
And I will have him
get on that right away

20:27.134 --> 20:29.234
First thing
in the morning, okay?

20:30.937 --> 20:33.672
May I ask what you're doing
out here this time of night?

20:33.739 --> 20:37.875
Uh, justjust working late.

20:37.943 --> 20:40.310
Just been working.

20:45.716 --> 20:47.750
Mind if I take
a look in the back?

20:47.817 --> 20:50.719
Based on what?

20:50.787 --> 20:53.888
Based on my gut sense
that someone like you

20:53.956 --> 20:55.323
Shouldn't be somewhere
like here right now.

20:55.324 --> 20:56.857
Oh, come on, I told you.

20:56.858 --> 20:59.726
I've just been working late.
Just open up the back, ma'am.

20:59.794 --> 21:01.194
Right.
No, of course.

21:01.195 --> 21:05.232
Uh, it's just...
It's been such a long day

21:05.300 --> 21:08.568
And I just...
I just wanna get home

21:08.636 --> 21:10.536
And get some sleep.

21:11.905 --> 21:14.907
It would really, really
be worth it to me.

21:17.144 --> 21:19.578
Ma'am,
put your money away

21:19.645 --> 21:21.979
And take a step
out of the van.

21:24.182 --> 21:26.949
Okay.

21:27.017 --> 21:28.551
Of course...

21:28.552 --> 21:30.452
If that's the way
you want it.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.802
Come on, come on.

21:52.869 --> 21:55.403
Anything else besides this
flight out of miami

21:55.471 --> 21:56.938
That he was specific about?

21:56.939 --> 21:58.541
Leila buchanan,
his girlfriend.

21:58.542 --> 22:00.376
We should check
reports on missing persons.

22:00.377 --> 22:01.945
Start in the miami area.

22:01.946 --> 22:03.412
And he kept talking
about this woman

22:03.413 --> 22:05.281
Who he said was involved
in our kidnappings.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.549
He uploaded
a picture onto my computer.

22:11.154 --> 22:12.487
Where's my computer?

22:12.488 --> 22:13.855
you have to access that system

22:13.856 --> 22:16.757
From a secured hardline
inside the yuma field office.

22:16.825 --> 22:18.859
You can't connect
on a wifi.

22:21.562 --> 22:23.462
He's here.

22:26.333 --> 22:29.234
Got ya.

22:30.370 --> 22:31.570
The trunk of the car?
Really?

22:31.571 --> 22:32.771
Wait.
You should've run

22:32.772 --> 22:33.939
When you had the chance.
Just hear me out.

22:33.940 --> 22:35.306
I found her.
Game over, mr. Walker.

22:35.307 --> 22:37.475
Vicky roberts from new york.
She's got my girlfriend.

22:37.543 --> 22:40.211
21509th avenue.

22:40.279 --> 22:42.547
Call the cops!
We are the cops.

22:42.614 --> 22:45.182
She's the one from the ship.
She's got leila.

22:45.250 --> 22:48.019
Vicky roberts,
that's her name.

22:48.087 --> 22:50.621
Yeah.
One of them.

22:55.359 --> 22:57.527
Wwhy would any
innocent person

22:57.594 --> 22:58.828
Need that many identities?

22:58.829 --> 23:00.429
whoever that is,

23:00.430 --> 23:02.064
She's got leila.
Please!

23:02.065 --> 23:03.465
Please,
I need your help!

23:03.466 --> 23:06.467
Please!

23:38.060 --> 23:41.228
I find debussy
a little soft.

23:43.764 --> 23:46.666
This location
is entirely secure.

23:46.734 --> 23:49.769
24hour surveillance
and security in every room.

23:49.837 --> 23:53.372
There's no need
to be nervous or afraid of any

23:53.440 --> 23:55.340
Can I have some water?

24:06.482 --> 24:08.750
With ice.

24:13.321 --> 24:15.221
Of course.

24:20.727 --> 24:23.695
The water at inostranka
always tasted like piss.

24:23.762 --> 24:27.665
I'll look into that.
Mm.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.735
Don't bother.

24:30.736 --> 24:33.838
I'm not, uh, going back.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.206
Right?

24:35.207 --> 24:37.574
Once you give us
the information we need,

24:37.642 --> 24:40.010
You'll be as free as I am.

24:43.280 --> 24:45.214
All right.
Let's do it.

24:46.549 --> 24:49.317
I wanna know
who did this,

24:49.385 --> 24:51.752
How they did it,

24:51.819 --> 24:53.719
And where they are.

24:56.824 --> 24:59.058
What's so funny?

24:59.125 --> 25:02.060
That's all you wanna know?

25:02.127 --> 25:05.129
That's easy.

25:07.265 --> 25:08.900
Then start talking.

25:08.901 --> 25:11.069
I want money.

25:11.136 --> 25:12.836
Okay.
And protection.

25:12.837 --> 25:14.537
Done.
And I wanna live

25:14.538 --> 25:16.005
In place where
the sun doesn't set

25:16.006 --> 25:17.606
At 2:00
in the damn afternoon.

25:17.607 --> 25:20.075
That can be arranged.

25:21.677 --> 25:22.810
And I want my girlfriend.

25:22.811 --> 25:24.112
Her name is maya.

25:24.113 --> 25:27.114
or number 31 to you.

25:28.783 --> 25:31.652
Let's go!

25:35.555 --> 25:37.455
Let's go, come on!
Let's go!

25:37.490 --> 25:39.390
Everybody!

25:41.427 --> 25:43.460
How bad is it?
I don't know.

25:43.528 --> 25:46.095
Thomas is gonna run.

25:46.163 --> 25:49.198
He's gathering a group now.
Can you walk?

25:49.266 --> 25:51.233
Get my boot?

25:51.301 --> 25:53.935
no, come on, just do it.

25:55.070 --> 25:56.871
Okay, I got you.
William!

25:56.872 --> 25:58.772
Come on.
William.

25:58.775 --> 26:01.377
Where are you going?
With thomas.

26:01.445 --> 26:03.745
No. You can't.

26:03.813 --> 26:05.413
No, it's fine.
It's nothing.

26:05.414 --> 26:09.016
Listen to me, it's critical
that thomas gets free up here.

26:09.084 --> 26:11.418
I can't risk
you slowing him down.

26:11.485 --> 26:12.985
Come on, sophia,
I'm not gonna let that happen.

26:12.986 --> 26:16.255
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

26:16.323 --> 26:18.323
Maya, you can go
with them if you want,

26:18.391 --> 26:20.725
But you have to decide now.

26:22.227 --> 26:25.229
Maya...

26:29.500 --> 26:31.267
I'll stay.
All right.

26:31.268 --> 26:33.502
Go circulate
amongst the group.

26:33.570 --> 26:36.572
Make sure you let them know
that they are not to resist.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.074
Do you understand?
I understand.

26:38.075 --> 26:40.909
Thank you.

26:45.546 --> 26:47.313
That wasn't
part of the deal.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.015
I can tell you
what they're doing here,

26:49.016 --> 26:50.317
Why they're doing it,

26:50.318 --> 26:52.585
And most importantly,
how to stop them

26:52.653 --> 26:55.655
Before it's too late.

27:02.128 --> 27:03.861
I'll need to make a call.

27:03.862 --> 27:06.863
Mmhmm.
You do that.

27:27.381 --> 27:28.747
What do you think?

27:28.748 --> 27:30.449
Well, as you know,
I've felt for some time

27:30.450 --> 27:32.284
That sophia and her people
have an agenda

27:32.285 --> 27:33.618
They've been hiding from us.

27:33.619 --> 27:35.486
Do you believe him?

27:35.487 --> 27:37.387
You looked him in the eye,
what do you think?

27:37.389 --> 27:41.191
I think he's
telling us the truth.

27:41.259 --> 27:42.759
Okay.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.427
If he's willing
to turn on sophia,

27:44.428 --> 27:45.861
Give him what he wants.

27:45.862 --> 27:49.131
And keep him talking
until his damn voice gives out.

27:57.807 --> 28:00.675
Sophia, we're only
clear for four minutes.

28:00.742 --> 28:04.077
Did you hear about what
thomas did to the passengers?

28:04.145 --> 28:05.813
The president told me.

28:05.814 --> 28:08.248
And about his offer.

28:09.984 --> 28:11.651
William agreed to talk.

28:11.652 --> 28:15.654
He'll tell them everything,
if he hasn't already.

28:15.722 --> 28:17.789
He hasn't.

28:17.856 --> 28:19.490
How can you be sure?

28:19.491 --> 28:22.193
Because we're still alive.

28:22.260 --> 28:24.294
I should've dealt with him
when I had the chance.

28:24.362 --> 28:26.396
You protected him.

28:26.464 --> 28:28.364
Why?

28:29.799 --> 28:32.800
That was my responsibility,
to protect you all.

28:32.868 --> 28:34.969
And now?

28:35.037 --> 28:40.107
And now...
You'll have to deal with him.

28:52.286 --> 28:55.154
It's not too late,
but we have to act now.

28:56.956 --> 28:58.156
What happened?

28:58.157 --> 29:00.024
Black box
got mangled in the crash.

29:00.025 --> 29:02.392
Audio forensics are trying
to reconstruct the rest.

29:02.460 --> 29:03.727
He was talking
to the captain.

29:03.728 --> 29:04.861
Yes, sir.
He seemed to know

29:04.862 --> 29:06.128
About the plan to crash
the plane.

29:06.129 --> 29:07.462
And who is he?

29:07.463 --> 29:08.864
He identified himself
as sean,

29:08.865 --> 29:10.765
But there wasn't a sean
on the plane's manifest.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.533
They did, however,

29:12.534 --> 29:14.769
Find a discarded
maintenance uniform

29:14.836 --> 29:16.304
In the plane's bathroom.

29:16.305 --> 29:18.575
So he snuck on.
Yeah.

29:18.643 --> 29:20.076
We did a little bit
of digging,

29:20.077 --> 29:22.044
And the pilot's daughter
was dating a sean walker.

29:22.112 --> 29:24.245
What do we know about him?

29:24.313 --> 29:25.913
Well, he's bright.

29:25.914 --> 29:27.814
He hacked into a pentagon server
when he was 16

29:27.881 --> 29:29.281
For the fun of it.

29:29.282 --> 29:31.182
Earned him a juvenile record
and a scholarship to m.I.T.

29:31.217 --> 29:33.985
Been freelancing
as a software programmer

29:34.053 --> 29:36.554
For internet and gaming
companies since he graduated.

29:36.622 --> 29:38.189
Very much under the radar
until this.

29:38.190 --> 29:39.825
Same guy?

29:39.826 --> 29:41.860
On a cruise with a girl
until about eight days ago.

29:41.928 --> 29:43.762
The girl now appears
to be missing,

29:43.763 --> 29:46.331
And walker was linked
to a murder onboard.

29:46.398 --> 29:48.232
I think it's
a viable lead, sir.

29:48.233 --> 29:49.333
Am I missing something?

29:49.334 --> 29:52.035
All the passengers
on that plane are dead.

29:52.103 --> 29:55.605
Except for walker,
apparently.

29:55.673 --> 29:57.740
Fbi in yuma picked him up
earlier today, sir.

29:57.808 --> 29:59.174
Who else knows about this?

29:59.175 --> 30:00.876
No one.
I brought it straight to you.

30:00.877 --> 30:02.544
This man could lead
to whoever's behind

30:02.545 --> 30:04.579
The assassination attempt
on the president.

30:04.647 --> 30:07.048
I understand, sir.

30:07.116 --> 30:09.517
Get him.
Now.

30:09.584 --> 30:11.718
Yes, sir.

30:13.554 --> 30:15.454
Justin...
Yes, sir?

30:15.488 --> 30:17.889
I don't have
to tell you to...

30:17.956 --> 30:20.024
Keep this needtoknow.

30:20.092 --> 30:22.259
Of course, sir.

30:30.765 --> 30:33.367
Of seven identities,
only one, erica bartlett,

30:33.435 --> 30:35.335
Seemed to exist prior
to 2002.

30:35.370 --> 30:37.304
She was supposedly
killed in a car accident

30:37.372 --> 30:38.705
While studying mandarin

30:38.706 --> 30:40.807
At the jing zi institute
in hong kong.

30:40.875 --> 30:43.610
Turns out jing zi was
part of a shadow organization

30:43.678 --> 30:45.145
With ties to the nsa.

30:45.146 --> 30:46.546
So she works
for the government?

30:46.547 --> 30:48.480
Not according
to any official records.

30:48.548 --> 30:50.448
But...Melissa wade
briefly resided

30:50.449 --> 30:51.983
In a government subsidized
building

30:51.984 --> 30:53.951
Known to house
young intelligence trainees.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.687
Sounds like some kind
of underground operative.

30:56.754 --> 30:58.288
Yep.
I called the faa

30:58.289 --> 30:59.823
Like you asked me to,
and guess what.

30:59.824 --> 31:01.691
Every single
air traffic controller

31:01.692 --> 31:03.792
Who was covering avias 514

31:03.860 --> 31:06.128
Was either
on vacation or sick.

31:06.196 --> 31:07.896
Every single computer
that should have

31:07.897 --> 31:10.331
A record of the flight pattern
seems to be down.

31:10.398 --> 31:12.366
Something
is definitely weird here.

31:12.433 --> 31:14.134
Yeah, definitely.
Agent collier?

31:14.135 --> 31:15.468
Yeah.
U.S. Marshals are here.

31:15.469 --> 31:18.171
Saying they have a transfer
order for sean walker.

31:18.238 --> 31:20.440
How'd a transfer
get approved?

31:20.507 --> 31:22.875
I haven't even finished
processing him yet.

31:22.943 --> 31:24.609
Thank you.

31:24.610 --> 31:26.411
Collier.
Hey.

31:26.412 --> 31:28.312
I hear you're taking
sean walker off our hands?

31:28.348 --> 31:29.748
Yes, ma'am.
Um, this is

31:29.749 --> 31:31.016
The first I've heard of it.

31:31.017 --> 31:32.751
Do you mind if I ask
who requested the transfer?

31:32.752 --> 31:34.519
Yeah...Asac douglas

31:34.520 --> 31:36.420
In the washington
field office.

31:37.923 --> 31:39.790
Ah.

31:39.791 --> 31:40.991
Guess news travels fast.

31:40.992 --> 31:42.726
yeah, I guess it does.

31:42.727 --> 31:44.761
I'll collect him for you.
Okay.

31:46.998 --> 31:48.398
You guys want anything?

31:48.399 --> 31:49.865
Coffee, bottled water?

31:49.866 --> 31:51.133
Nah, we're fine.
Thanks.

31:51.134 --> 31:52.767
Okay.
What's going on?

31:52.768 --> 31:54.836
Just sit tight.

31:54.904 --> 31:56.804
Like I have a choice.

31:59.909 --> 32:01.777
washington field office.

32:01.778 --> 32:03.045
Asac douglas, please.

32:03.046 --> 32:04.946
One moment.

32:08.483 --> 32:09.783
Yeah?

32:09.784 --> 32:11.117
Someone there
is placing a call

32:11.118 --> 32:12.451
To the washington
field office.

32:12.452 --> 32:14.953
come on, come on, come on.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.920
Kill the call now.

32:18.223 --> 32:23.059
hello?

32:35.536 --> 32:37.436
Here,
get out of those!

32:43.808 --> 32:45.708
Stay here.

32:51.515 --> 32:53.482
I got you.
Take out walker!

33:04.392 --> 33:06.527
Clear!

33:39.126 --> 33:41.127
Ground level,
vokolov shipping company.

33:41.195 --> 33:43.161
I'll take care of
the collateral damage.

33:45.164 --> 33:47.064
Let's go.

34:04.513 --> 34:05.980
Look...

34:05.981 --> 34:07.381
Whoever
you're working for...

34:07.382 --> 34:08.781
Whatever they're paying you,

34:08.782 --> 34:09.949
There's always another

34:09.949 --> 34:11.083
Mm.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.284
I admire your optimism.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.485
How'd you get
all that warm and fuzzy?

34:14.552 --> 34:16.520
It makes my teeth hurt.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.021
If I were in your shoes,

34:18.022 --> 34:19.922
I'd have trouble
being so magnanimous.

34:19.922 --> 34:22.090
It's not your fault
all the men in your life

34:22.158 --> 34:24.123
Are so easily manipulated.

34:24.192 --> 34:26.493
You don't know sean.

34:26.560 --> 34:30.263
He's never gonna
stop looking for me.

34:30.331 --> 34:32.664
Never.

34:32.732 --> 34:35.333
As lovely
as that story sounds,

34:35.400 --> 34:37.502
It's just not
gonna end up that way.

34:40.371 --> 34:42.539
Bitch!
Sit down!

35:24.409 --> 35:26.309
Drop it!

35:40.122 --> 35:42.289
Get his keys.

35:54.664 --> 35:56.897
Right there.

36:15.047 --> 36:16.947
Down!

36:30.127 --> 36:32.394
Maya.

36:32.462 --> 36:37.999
You're really here.
I am.

36:38.066 --> 36:41.201
But I don't understand.

36:41.269 --> 36:44.104
How did you do this?

36:44.172 --> 36:46.339
Well, I demanded it.

36:46.407 --> 36:49.042
In return for information.

36:49.109 --> 36:53.078
Don't you understand?
We're gonna be free.

36:53.146 --> 36:55.246
oh, no.

36:55.314 --> 36:57.515
Hey, what's wrong?

36:57.582 --> 37:00.817
What did you tell them,
william?

37:02.386 --> 37:06.288
I haven't told them
anything yet.

37:06.356 --> 37:09.090
I wanted to make sure
they kept their promise first.

37:12.695 --> 37:14.595
That was smart.

37:16.264 --> 37:18.598
Good.

37:18.666 --> 37:23.537
Hey, come here.

37:23.604 --> 37:25.671
That's just a taste, maya.

37:30.444 --> 37:33.745
It's beautiful.

37:33.813 --> 37:35.747
I've dreamed what
this moment would feel like.

37:35.814 --> 37:37.949
Haven't you?

37:39.784 --> 37:42.351
It's even
better than I imagined.

37:44.120 --> 37:46.822
I'm so glad.

38:02.102 --> 38:07.572
keep imagining.

38:07.640 --> 38:10.641
I'm sorry.

38:46.773 --> 38:48.673
Dog.

38:50.410 --> 38:52.510
Come on, where's your owner?
Come on.

38:59.851 --> 39:02.718
Hello?
Hello? Hello!

39:02.786 --> 39:06.456
Help me! I'm inside!
I'm in here!

39:27.042 --> 39:28.342
Yeah?

39:28.343 --> 39:30.043
Boyfriend got away.

39:30.044 --> 39:31.711
What, your men
didn't get there in time?

39:31.712 --> 39:33.313
That wasn't the problem.

39:33.314 --> 39:35.448
Then what was?
I spent time with walker.

39:35.515 --> 39:37.515
He shouldn't have been
a problem for you and smith.

39:37.583 --> 39:39.517
Yeah, well, he was.

39:39.585 --> 39:41.919
Looks like he's convinced
an fbi agent to help him.

39:41.987 --> 39:44.189
Think you might
have underestimated him.

39:44.257 --> 39:45.990
Well, do you have
any idea where he is?

39:45.991 --> 39:47.391
We're looking.

39:47.392 --> 39:49.259
Based on what
we think he told the fbi,

39:49.260 --> 39:51.428
It's clear he's starting
to put all this together.

39:51.495 --> 39:54.831
We still need the girl.

39:54.898 --> 39:56.798
That's what I'm here for.

40:00.604 --> 40:03.005
I told you
he'd come back for me.

41:16.033 --> 41:17.500
Uh, this is jinx.

41:17.501 --> 41:18.768
I need a medic team
right away.

41:18.769 --> 41:20.402
One of the passengers
is showing vitals.

41:20.403 --> 41:21.570
What?
They're all dead.

41:21.571 --> 41:22.971
I know that.
Will you just hurry?

41:22.972 --> 41:24.806
Somehow one of them
survived the crash.

41:24.807 --> 41:26.274
it's okay.

41:26.275 --> 41:28.409
You're gonna be okay.

42:05.875 --> 42:07.308
III need
some people down here.

42:07.309 --> 42:08.810
What's going on?

42:08.811 --> 42:11.612
Everyone's wak
they'rethey're all waking up.

42:13.214 --> 42:15.114
I need you down here now!
