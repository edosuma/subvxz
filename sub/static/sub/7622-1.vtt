13:48.746 --> 13:50.706

13:50.998 --> 13:53.292

are just myths.

13:57.338 --> 13:58.339

No, Mr. Lincoln,

14:00.883 --> 14:04.261

14:08.265 --> 14:10.768
If what you say is true,
you could help me kill him.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.269
I could pay you
to kill him!

14:12.436 --> 14:14.438
My services
are not for sale.

14:14.605 --> 14:16.357
And the word you are

14:16.440 --> 14:20.444
It is quite a feat to kill
that which is already dead.

14:24.698 --> 14:25.949
But you don't understand.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.285
My mother was murdered.

14:29.787 --> 14:33.290
And if I teach you how
to murder her murderer,

14:34.124 --> 14:35.959
so what?

14:36.126 --> 14:39.213
How will that
honor her memory?

14:39.380 --> 14:42.883
How will that benefit the next

14:43.050 --> 14:45.219

I would like you to chop this

15:55.664 --> 15:56.832
That tree?

15:57.166 --> 15:59.293
It's got to be more than a foot across.
That's impossible.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.588
It's what you hate

16:05.549 --> 16:06.884
what do you hate?

16:08.594 --> 16:10.262
I hate Jack Barts.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.723
Then strike him down.

16:18.854 --> 16:21.064
Well, clearly you don't
hate him that much.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.484
Tell me what you hate.
