WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.962
Previously on Dynasty...
So, I want to build a rocket

00:04.004 --> 00:05.005
and send it into space.

00:05.046 --> 00:06.923
Eva. Since Fallon can't make it,

00:06.965 --> 00:09.009
there's an empty seat next to me
at our table.

00:09.050 --> 00:12.220
FALLON:
Colin McNaughton?
We went to Wharton together.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.556
You may think you won this
battle, but this is war.

00:14.597 --> 00:16.975
She's barely got a pulse.
Call 911.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.685
And I am running to
be the next U.S. senator

00:18.727 --> 00:20.937
from the great state of Georgia.

00:20.979 --> 00:23.523
Amanda is not your cousin,
she is your sister.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.608
We have a secret sister?

00:33.283 --> 00:34.617
Fallon.
Mm-hmm.

00:34.659 --> 00:36.369
Is everything okay?

00:36.411 --> 00:38.580
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Everything's great.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.457
Just keep up the good work.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.711
Right there?
Mm-hmm.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.921
All right, you seem distracted.

00:46.963 --> 00:49.591
And typically, you're a bit
more vocal in this arena.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.342
Well, I just told you
that you were doing

00:51.384 --> 00:52.635
a great job, didn't I?

00:52.677 --> 00:54.179
This about your sister
showing up?

00:54.220 --> 00:56.264
Half sister.
And from the Morell side.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.058
So you know that gene pool
is tainted, but no.

00:58.099 --> 01:02.020
No, I decided that she's not
gonna be a problem.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.731
Why are you...

01:04.773 --> 01:06.274
Really?!

01:06.316 --> 01:08.902
Look, I'm a very skilled
multitasker, okay?

01:08.943 --> 01:10.445
I'm a task now?

01:10.487 --> 01:11.988
No, no, of course not.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.698
It's just I've been tracking
irregular stock activity

01:13.740 --> 01:16.242
from Fallon Unlimited
since the opening bell, okay?

01:16.284 --> 01:17.827
Something is off.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.579
Well, that's one thing
we agree on.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.289
(phone chimes)
(gasps)
It's Eva.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.461
Oh, the board is calling an
emergency meeting. I have to go.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.004
Or you stay for
breakfast in bed,

01:28.046 --> 01:29.672
and we rekindle our spark.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.633
The candles aren't even
dripping wax yet.

01:31.674 --> 01:35.303
I know I haven't been
the most amazing wife recently,

01:35.345 --> 01:38.139
and I'm sorry, but they don't
call emergency board meetings

01:38.181 --> 01:39.641
just for the bagels.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.643
Right. Work. Again.

01:41.684 --> 01:44.813
How about we do something

01:44.854 --> 01:47.690
amazing and romantic
tomorrow night?

01:47.732 --> 01:49.234
Just the two of us.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.277
Would be cool to do
something outdoorsy.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.445
Terrible cell service.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.989
I could plan it.
There you go.

01:55.031 --> 01:57.450
I mean, I'm a little bummed that
that was your first choice,

01:57.492 --> 02:00.036
but sure, we'll make it work.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.663
Mwah!

02:05.583 --> 02:08.837
Ah!

02:08.878 --> 02:09.921
I swear your bag
wasn't this heavy

02:09.963 --> 02:11.464
before you left for rehab.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.676
Was retail therapy
part of your recovery?

02:14.717 --> 02:17.137
My life was spiraling,
not my fashion sense.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.097
Um, where is everyone?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.432
I mean, I wasn't expecting
the staff to be lined up

02:21.474 --> 02:23.184
Downton Abbey style,
but still...

02:23.226 --> 02:24.477
Well, that's because
I didn't want you

02:24.519 --> 02:26.771
to feel uncomfortable,
so I told everyone

02:26.813 --> 02:28.314
to just act like
it was a normal day.

02:28.356 --> 02:29.566
Well, they're doing
a great job. (chuckles)

02:29.607 --> 02:30.942
Mm.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.235
You should probably
get going, too.

02:32.277 --> 02:33.736
You must be slammed at work.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.530
As the former La Mirage
event manager...

02:35.572 --> 02:38.324
Coordinator.
But why split hairs?

02:38.366 --> 02:40.702
I know weekends are
insanely busy.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.412
Don't worry about me.

02:42.453 --> 02:44.831
I've already planned for this.
Javier's handling everything.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.875
It's just a small wedding
for 300,

02:46.916 --> 02:50.170
and a convention full of
comic book nerds; no biggie.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.172
Kirby. You're back.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.549
Yep.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.968
Here I am.
(clears throat)

02:57.010 --> 03:00.388
I'm-I'm doing really good.

03:00.430 --> 03:04.100
I'm glad. Um...

03:04.142 --> 03:06.561
best of luck.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.146
I-I gotta run.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.982
Okay, well, I'll see you.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.152
Well, you guys seem good.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.404
I guess I should have
expected that.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.406
He didn't reply to a single one
of my emails

03:18.448 --> 03:19.490
I sent him from rehab.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.075
These things take time.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.036
I know.

03:23.077 --> 03:26.122
I have a long list of people
I need to make amends to.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.582
I don't know how
I'm gonna do it.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.293
With me by your side,
that's how. Okay?

03:30.335 --> 03:33.171
I told you I'm here for you.
It'll be easy.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.215
You'll see.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.592
Fallon!
Kirby. Welcome home.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.552
Thanks. Look,
I just want to say

03:39.594 --> 03:41.596
I'm sorry for everything
that happened.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.181
Yeah. Got it.
You're forgiven.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.391
Check me off the list.
See you at dinner. Bye.

03:48.269 --> 03:50.480
Easy. See?

03:52.232 --> 03:55.777
Well, it seems that, uh,
momentum is back on my side.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.529
Campaign contributions
are on the rise.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.114
And it'll stay that way,

04:00.156 --> 04:01.866
as long as there's not another
insane press conference

04:01.908 --> 04:02.951
like the last one.

04:02.992 --> 04:04.410
Sorry to interrupt.

04:04.452 --> 04:06.579
Amanda. Right on cue.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.581
Your staff told me that
I might find Adam here.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.250
I'm afraid you just missed him.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.668
Oh. Bad timing.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.545
I seem to have a habit
of that lately.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.673
Well, I wanted to apologize.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.925
The press conference
ended up being

04:18.967 --> 04:20.426
a little bit of a circus.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.845
It wasn't your fault, but
that's very kind of you.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.722
Actually, I'm-I'm glad
that you're here.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.224
Really?

04:26.266 --> 04:27.225
Well, when you're
running for office,

04:27.267 --> 04:29.102
and your ex-wife declares

04:29.143 --> 04:30.478
that she's had a
secret love child

04:30.520 --> 04:31.854
while you were married,

04:31.896 --> 04:33.898
it tends to be fodder
for the press.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.942
Well, I'm from England.
We love scandal.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.945
I mean, haven't you seen
The Crown?

04:38.987 --> 04:41.281
But this secret's
already out, so...

04:41.322 --> 04:42.615
No, you misunderstand me.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.659
I'm talking about moving
forward.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.452
So if you have any skeletons
in your closet,

04:46.494 --> 04:47.662
we need to start
unpacking them now.

04:47.704 --> 04:51.291
I don't need to do anything.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.960
See, our lives,
they barely intersect.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.129
I was raised in an
upstanding family in Kensington,

04:56.170 --> 04:57.547
I graduated from Oxford,

04:57.588 --> 04:59.299
and now I work for
one of the most prestigious

04:59.340 --> 05:00.675
law firms in London.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.677
So if me getting to know
my birth mother

05:02.719 --> 05:04.762
derails your campaign,

05:04.804 --> 05:06.723
well, it sounds like your
campaign might need some help.

05:06.764 --> 05:08.641
But as you said,

05:08.683 --> 05:10.101
maybe I misunderstood.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.270
Tell Adam I stopped by.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.688
Or don't.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.023
Hold on, hold on.

05:15.064 --> 05:17.108
I'm sorry.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.902
You seem like a very bright
and confident young woman.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.947
A benefit of not being
raised by Alexis.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.575
Amanda, would you
join me for breakfast?

05:25.616 --> 05:27.702
I could use some tips on
putting Blake in his place.

05:27.744 --> 05:28.786
(chuckles)

05:28.828 --> 05:30.038
If you don't mind

05:30.079 --> 05:31.664
how bright it is in here.
Ladies.

05:35.585 --> 05:36.919
(sneezes)

05:36.961 --> 05:39.047
Bless you.
Excuse me.

05:42.383 --> 05:44.886
Whoever's buying up large
quantities of our stock

05:44.927 --> 05:46.429
has been doing it
through shell companies,

05:46.471 --> 05:48.514
hoping to go undetected.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.975
We need to consider this
a hostile takeover possibility.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.352
Okay, thank you, Quinton.

05:52.393 --> 05:53.770
But what can we do about it?

05:53.811 --> 05:55.438
Americano, a shot
of espresso.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.857
I thought it was
that kind of morning.
You're an angel.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.609
Oh, clear my schedule

05:59.650 --> 06:01.069
for a date night
with Liam tomorrow.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.612
Copy that.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.739
And hold all my calls
until we find the bastard

06:04.781 --> 06:06.616
who's buying all my stock.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.117
No need to hold any calls.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.952
He's here.
Colin?

06:09.994 --> 06:12.997
Mystery solved.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.457
Though "bastard" seems

06:14.499 --> 06:16.709
a little old-fashioned
for you.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.388
Talk to me, Anders.

06:52.912 --> 06:53.955
COLIN:
Well, my dear,

06:53.996 --> 06:55.706
I did warn you I'd be back

06:55.748 --> 06:57.166
after you stole my land.

06:57.208 --> 07:00.420
Oh, and back you are,
like a bad rash.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.130
I assume you're here
to unveil

07:02.171 --> 07:04.257
whatever ill-conceived plan
you have for my company.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.634
More to get a few measurements
for my decorator.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.929
My sense of style doesn't lean
quite so drab.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.598
No, you're never taking
this office from me.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.350
It's not really up to you.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.893
See, while you were
busy launching

07:15.935 --> 07:17.562
your frivolous shopping network,

07:17.603 --> 07:19.647
I was gobbling up your stock.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.899
And once I accrue
another five percent,

07:21.941 --> 07:23.568
I'll have the controlling
interest.

07:23.609 --> 07:26.487
Once you accrue another
five percent?

07:26.529 --> 07:27.905
You should know better
than to gloat

07:27.947 --> 07:29.115
before a deal is done.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.825
Don't you worry,
I've already secured

07:30.867 --> 07:32.994
a deal with a hedge fund for it.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.412
This is merely
a courtesy visit

07:34.454 --> 07:35.788
before announcing it at

07:35.830 --> 07:37.832
the board of directors
meeting tomorrow.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.375
Oh.
(camera clicks)

07:39.417 --> 07:40.960
The look on your face is
even better than I'd hoped.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.628
Okay, we're done here.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.005
Does that mean you're going to
throw in the towel?

07:44.046 --> 07:46.174
The only towel
I will be throwing

07:46.215 --> 07:48.843
is the one onto the sand
on vacation

07:48.885 --> 07:52.138
as I celebrate victory.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.807
Game on, Oliver Twisted.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.934
♪ ♪

08:19.040 --> 08:20.708
Hey, thanks for coming.
Yeah.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.001
So what's this big
PR plan you have

08:22.043 --> 08:24.754
for launching the new club?
Well...

08:24.795 --> 08:28.424
I was thinking we'd have
this place host a podcast...
A podcast?

08:28.466 --> 08:31.219
How will that help?
Four listeners drop in

08:31.260 --> 08:32.887
for a glass of sparkling water?
(chuckles)

08:32.929 --> 08:34.764
You didn't let me finish.

08:34.805 --> 08:37.058
Guess who's willing to do
his podcast from the club?

08:37.099 --> 08:39.143
You know, I always wonder
why people do this.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.311
You obviously want to tell me,

08:40.353 --> 08:41.729
and the odds of me guessing
are...

08:41.771 --> 08:43.898
Okay, you are taking
all the fun out of this.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.317
I got Andre to do
his podcast here.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.110
On With Andre Andre?

08:48.152 --> 08:49.403
Boom.
That's exactly who
I was picturing.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.280
I knew I should have guessed.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.032
I convinced him to do
one interview here,

08:53.074 --> 08:54.617
and if it goes well,
he might be willing

08:54.659 --> 08:57.286
to do a whole series
when the new club opens.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.372
This is great. He has a huge
built-in audience.

08:59.413 --> 09:00.998
Cool people with a lot of money.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.084
That's exactly the buzz we need
for a successful launch.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.710
Yeah. That's why
I thought of it.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.963
We just need to find him
a great first interview.

09:07.004 --> 09:10.174
Right. Someone bold
and interesting.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.968
Is Lizzo available?
Or should I call...

09:12.009 --> 09:14.178
No. Andre's been wanting
to do a series

09:14.220 --> 09:16.430
on successful Black
businessmen in Atlanta.

09:16.472 --> 09:20.726
Okay, well, there's no denying
you're successful, but you...

09:20.768 --> 09:22.186
I wasn't talking about me.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.521
But I know just the
person to ask.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.814
Do you want me to guess again?

09:24.855 --> 09:26.023
'Cause this time I'll
totally get it.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.527
Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.861
Liam.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.114
Hi. What a nice surprise.

09:33.155 --> 09:35.199
Aren't you sweet bringing
your wife coffee at work.

09:35.241 --> 09:38.869
One double shot macchiato,
extra foam, right?

09:38.911 --> 09:40.830
Wait, is this for me?

09:40.871 --> 09:42.582
Well, I remember you mentioning
craving one

09:42.623 --> 09:44.083
at the awards ceremony,

09:44.125 --> 09:46.711
So consider it a small thank-you
for your support.

09:46.752 --> 09:50.673
Well, it's perfect.
Exactly what I needed.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.800
Oh, and don't worry,
Fallon's schedule is cleared

09:52.842 --> 09:54.010
for your date tomorrow night.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.803
Thank you.
I actually came by

09:55.845 --> 09:57.430
to bounce an idea off of her.

09:57.471 --> 09:59.140
I was thinking a catered dinner

09:59.181 --> 10:01.559
under the stars in my family's
vineyard might be nice, right?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.060
As long as your mother's
not there,

10:03.102 --> 10:04.687
count me in, I love it.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.231
Great. I will set the details.
That is for you.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.941
I'll see you at home.
FALLON: Bye.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.570
Your husband is so great.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.780
Dinner under the stars?
Romantic.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.574
Sure is.
Write yourself a Post-it

10:16.616 --> 10:18.075
to buy me some bug spray.

10:18.117 --> 10:21.078
So, I figured out
how to counter Colin's move.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.831
If I sell off
my radio division,

10:23.873 --> 10:26.083
I will have enough capital
for a Pac-Man defense.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.877
Or Ms. Pac-Man in this case.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.712
I totally remember that
from Wharton.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.422
You use that cash to turn around
and buy a large stake

10:31.464 --> 10:32.882
in Colin's company.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.092
Exactly. Colin won't have
enough capital

10:35.134 --> 10:37.470
to save his company
and buy the five percent

10:37.511 --> 10:39.180
he needs to control this one.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.223
I'll set a quick board meeting
to get approval for the sale.

10:41.265 --> 10:44.352
No time. It's called
a hostile takeover for a reason.

10:44.393 --> 10:46.395
Something they don't
teach you at Wharton:

10:46.437 --> 10:47.897
never ask for permission

10:47.938 --> 10:50.232
when you can ask for
forgiveness later.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.407
Blake, I would offer you
a glass,

10:58.449 --> 11:00.785
but that would imply
I want you to stay.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.536
We need to discuss Amanda.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.622
Yes, I cheated on you.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.208
Again, I'm sorry. Again.

11:07.249 --> 11:09.085
Does that sound sincere?
I hope not.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.253
I don't care that you
cheated on me, Alexis.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.880
You think I wasn't
dipping my pen

11:12.922 --> 11:14.423
in different ink wells
while we were married?

11:14.465 --> 11:15.758
Charming.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.178
Did it ever occur to you
that Amanda

11:19.220 --> 11:21.013
might actually be my daughter?

11:21.055 --> 11:24.642
No. We weren't even sleeping
in the same room at the time.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.561
Thankfully, I had yoga
to provide me comfort.

11:27.603 --> 11:28.854
And by yoga, I mean Gabe,

11:28.896 --> 11:31.107
the instructor,
and by comfort,

11:31.148 --> 11:33.067
I mean sex, and a lot of it.

11:33.109 --> 11:36.404
Anders' Carrington calendar
from 1996.

11:36.445 --> 11:40.074
"September:
Alexis returns from London."

11:40.116 --> 11:43.703
Yes. I returned right after
Amanda was born.

11:43.744 --> 11:46.330
Thank you for the update
from the last millennium.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.416
Hey, well, just for fun,
let's flip back,

11:48.457 --> 11:50.918
I don't know, say 40 weeks.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.712
"Blake and Alexis in Miami

11:52.753 --> 11:54.880
for Warren Buffett's
New Year's Eve party."

11:54.922 --> 11:57.383
Sounds familiar. Yes.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.468
The dinner was awful,

11:59.510 --> 12:02.555
so I went for a liquid diet.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.223
I barely remember anything
after that.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.975
Do you remember waking up
in a hotel room

12:06.016 --> 12:06.976
with me the next morning?

12:07.017 --> 12:08.853
Vaguely.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.896
It certainly doesn't mean
we had sex.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.524
It doesn't mean that we didn't.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.568
And Amanda sneezed in
the sunlight this morning.

12:15.609 --> 12:17.737
Is that code for something?

12:17.778 --> 12:19.947
I also sneeze at sunlight.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.490
Clearly she's allergic to it,

12:21.532 --> 12:23.325
just like me;
it's a real thing.
Okay...

12:23.367 --> 12:25.953
We all miss Anders,

12:25.995 --> 12:28.789
but you need to hire someone
to start dusting again.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.583
You cannot deny that
she could be my daughter.

12:30.624 --> 12:34.503
I can. She's not yours.
Denied.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.631
MICHAEL:
Man, I thought I was crazy

12:37.673 --> 12:39.258
asking for a telescope
as a kid.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.553
You have your own space company,
with government backing.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.930
I guess it is
a pretty big deal, huh?

12:44.972 --> 12:46.599
Uh, it's huge.
(laughs)

12:46.640 --> 12:48.601
Which is why I have
a favor to ask.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.644
No, you can't have a seat
on the first flight.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.062
Oh, don't worry, I'm more of

12:52.104 --> 12:53.063
a feet-on-the-ground
kind of dude.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.690
(laughs)

12:54.732 --> 12:56.567
You know the It's On With Andre
podcast?

12:56.609 --> 12:58.569
I convinced Andre
to do an episode

12:58.611 --> 13:00.404
at the club to help
promote our opening,

13:00.446 --> 13:05.034
but I need a local A-lister
to sell him on doing more.

13:05.075 --> 13:07.495
And since I'm looking at
a local A-lister...

13:07.536 --> 13:10.206
Look, you know I got you, right?

13:10.247 --> 13:13.250
But ColbyCo Space is taking up
all my time right now.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.835
What about Fallon?

13:14.877 --> 13:17.129
Andre wants to focus on
Black success stories,

13:17.171 --> 13:18.506
and there's no bigger one
than you.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.549
It's our chance to get
our stories out there.

13:20.591 --> 13:23.177
Positive role models.
Change the narrative.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.763
With your fame, success,
influence...

13:25.805 --> 13:27.223
Okay, okay, I get it.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.766
This is quite the speech.

13:28.808 --> 13:32.102
I just want to start
the club off right.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.854
Fine.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.648
But I'm only doing this
for you.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.107
I can live with that.

13:39.652 --> 13:44.615
You messed with the wrong
CEO, frat boy.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.659
Well, for the record,
I've never stepped foot

13:46.700 --> 13:48.160
into a fraternity.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.662
Unlike you, I imagine.

13:49.703 --> 13:50.955
Hmm.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.832
You do look piqued.
Rough day?

13:52.873 --> 13:55.584
Far from it.
In fact,

13:55.626 --> 13:57.044
I went on a shopping spree.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.170
You want to know
what I bought?

13:58.212 --> 13:59.713
Would it matter if I said no?

13:59.755 --> 14:02.007
A huge chunk of stock

14:02.049 --> 14:05.094
in McNaughton Global Media.

14:05.135 --> 14:08.180
And now that I own a sizeable
stake in your company,

14:08.222 --> 14:09.640
you'll have to hit pause
on your plans

14:09.682 --> 14:10.933
to take over mine.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.312
That's not the right face.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.897
The Pac-Man defense?

14:16.939 --> 14:20.067
Well, I'm calling it
the Ms. Pac-Man defense...

14:20.109 --> 14:23.237
I'm curious. What will
your board of directors say

14:23.279 --> 14:24.989
when you tell them
you sold a major division

14:25.030 --> 14:27.449
of your company to thwart
an old rival?

14:27.491 --> 14:29.076
Or-or crush.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.536
Don't flatter yourself.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.454
I can tell you exactly
what they'll say,

14:32.496 --> 14:34.456
because I had drinks with them
a couple of hours ago,

14:34.498 --> 14:36.333
and they did not seem
very happy.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.668
You baited me?

14:37.710 --> 14:40.671
You didn't even want
a hostile takeover.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.631
You wanted my seat

14:42.673 --> 14:44.550
as chairman of the board.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.302
If only you were this smart
24 hours ago,

14:46.343 --> 14:48.888
you wouldn't be
in this position.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.806
Going rogue with a public
corporation?

14:50.848 --> 14:52.641
Not great optics.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.311
Which, as a majority
shareholder, I'll point out

14:55.352 --> 14:56.770
at the board meeting tomorrow.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.522
Oh, I'll fight this.
Of course you will.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.900
But I'm certain I can get
the necessary support

15:00.941 --> 15:03.277
to install myself
as the new chairman.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.029
I think the board will agree

15:05.070 --> 15:08.115
that perhaps it's time
Fallon is

15:08.157 --> 15:10.409
a little less unlimited.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.457
Great.
I'll tell her the good news.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.542
Ah.
Father, what are you
doing here?

15:18.584 --> 15:19.877
Is everything okay?

15:19.919 --> 15:21.795
Well, can't a father
visit his son at work?

15:21.837 --> 15:23.881
You can, but you don't.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.133
Okay, I need your help.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.262
I think Amanda
may be my daughter.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.639
I'm sorry, what?

15:31.680 --> 15:32.973
Well, Alexis denies it,
of course,

15:33.015 --> 15:34.308
but I've got a feeling
about this,

15:34.350 --> 15:35.225
and my feelings are
usually right.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.727
Even if this is true,

15:36.769 --> 15:38.270
which I'm sure
it's probably not,

15:38.312 --> 15:40.105
are you sure you want to
claim Amanda as yours?

15:40.147 --> 15:42.191
She's bad news, like her mother.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.735
Well, that may be so,
but if she's a Carrington,

15:44.777 --> 15:46.612
it's my duty to get her away
from Alexis

15:46.654 --> 15:48.280
before she's corrupted
beyond repair.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.657
So why do you need me?

15:49.698 --> 15:51.158
Just ask her to take
a DNA test.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.077
Well, you remember
how traumatizing it was

15:53.118 --> 15:55.079
when you found out that we were
your biological parents.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.247
I'm still trying to forget.
So you understand.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.625
I can't upend her life
until I'm certain.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.212
What can I do?

16:03.253 --> 16:06.090
Javier, you need to contact
every vendor in Atlanta

16:06.131 --> 16:08.175
until we find enough of that
2008 vintage

16:08.217 --> 16:10.177
for a 300-person toast.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.596
Everything okay?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.848
Hey. Yeah, great.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.601
Javier's got it all
under control at the hotel.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.311
So, where are we
with the apology tour?

16:19.353 --> 16:20.938
I'm checking people
off the list.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.565
You know, Mrs. Gunnerson,
Tony, the gardener.

16:23.607 --> 16:26.944
Even Jerry, the pool guy,
who I don't remember offending.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.947
Probably because he started
working here two weeks ago.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.241
But if you're apologizing
to people you don't even know,

16:32.282 --> 16:34.159
it sounds like you're
almost done.
Are you kidding?

16:34.201 --> 16:36.036
My biggest apology is
still looming.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.205
Right.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.791
Although I think Adam's
been doing double shifts

16:40.833 --> 16:45.129
at the hospital, so maybe
I should wait on that one.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.131
Fine.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.299
I'm just really not
looking forward to it.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.136
I know. But you can't
avoid Adam's

16:52.177 --> 16:53.971
or anyone else's apology
forever.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.723
I'll drive you, and you can

16:55.764 --> 16:57.808
rip off that apology
Band-Aid right there.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.853
Okay?
(whimpers)

17:00.894 --> 17:03.772
FALLON:
You know what the worst part is?

17:03.814 --> 17:04.982
That you may lose the company?

17:05.024 --> 17:06.859
Okay, the second worst part.

17:06.900 --> 17:10.195
I am actually impressed by
Colin's business savvy,

17:10.237 --> 17:12.448
which also makes me
feel gross inside.

17:12.489 --> 17:15.117
So I'm impressed and repulsed.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.453
I get it. Plus he's handsome.

17:17.494 --> 17:20.456
Okay, that's not helpful.
Anyway, if this thing is

17:20.497 --> 17:22.332
gonna come down to
a board vote today,

17:22.374 --> 17:24.543
then I need to make sure I have
enough board members on my side.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.794
Which is what you were
supposed to be working on.

17:25.836 --> 17:26.920
So what did you find out?

17:26.962 --> 17:28.547
You have Daniel,
Aubrey, Leslie,

17:28.589 --> 17:29.882
all loyal and locked in.

17:29.923 --> 17:33.260
But Gary, Brian and Ellen
are Team Colin.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.720
Which leaves Quinn
as a swing vote.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.431
Okay, get me Quinn's calendar

17:37.473 --> 17:38.849
and tabs on his location.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.726
Colin is going to be
gunning for him as well,

17:40.768 --> 17:42.269
so I need to move fast.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.896
Definitely.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.359
Like faster than this.
Hmm?

17:49.401 --> 17:51.278
Oh, right. Sorry.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.239
And that's when you started
to branch out

17:54.281 --> 17:55.449
with ColbyCo?

17:55.491 --> 17:57.034
Moving to a different
kind of tech?

17:57.076 --> 17:59.328
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That was still years away.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.288
This is going to be great
publicity for the club.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.290
It's going well.
Yeah, we've been trying
to get Colby

18:03.332 --> 18:04.666
on the podcast for a while now.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.043
This dude's on the verge
of becoming an icon.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.128
If Andre agrees to make this
a regular thing,

18:08.170 --> 18:09.671
maybe we can bring in
a live audience,

18:09.713 --> 18:10.839
record it for streaming.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.508
Yeah, we'd be into that.

18:12.549 --> 18:16.804
I think we covered the early
years of ColbyCo extensively.

18:16.845 --> 18:19.932
I want to talk about
what's happening now.

18:19.973 --> 18:21.975
What made you transition
to the space race?

18:22.017 --> 18:24.853
Well, for me, it's all about
a solid foundation.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.147
ColbyCo has allowed me
to do a whole host of things.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.398
Space is just one of them.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.735
Right. The one I'd love
to talk about.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.487
So I know you were just in D.C.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.155
Who told you that?

18:35.197 --> 18:37.741
It's not important.
My listeners want to hear,

18:37.783 --> 18:39.785
how'd that go,
and what's next?

18:39.827 --> 18:42.704
Uh, I don't think so.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.164
What?

18:44.206 --> 18:46.291
I don't really like
talking about things

18:46.333 --> 18:48.502
that aren't set yet.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.129
Call me superstitious.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.505
(chuckles)
Seriously?

18:51.547 --> 18:53.132
Do I look like
a dentist to you?

18:53.173 --> 18:55.342
'Cause it's starting to feel
like I'm pulling teeth here.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.010
Are you coming with
an attitude now?

18:57.052 --> 18:59.388
Look, bro, people don't care
about what's going on

18:59.429 --> 19:00.681
behind the cubicles
of ColbyCo.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.516
I mean, no one's asking
Richard Branson

19:02.558 --> 19:04.309
how Virgin's DVD sales
are doing.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.894
Don't "bro" me, bro.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.980
Okay, do you have any idea
what it took

19:08.021 --> 19:10.274
to get ColbyCo where it is
today?
Yeah, I do.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.109
Because you've been talking
about it endlessly.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.820
I think we're done here.
Are we?

19:14.862 --> 19:16.947
'Cause I'm thinking
we never started.
You know what, Andre?

19:16.989 --> 19:19.366
I've had just about enough...
Hold on, now.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.369
Where the hell is he going?
I'm out.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.705
Jeff...

19:24.746 --> 19:26.081
What the hell was that?

19:26.123 --> 19:28.625
The last podcast I'll be
doing for this dive.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.085
Nobody walks out on me.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.091
I actually didn't think
I'd hear from you.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.968
Cristal said you came by
yesterday.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.345
I really appreciate you trying
to make things right.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.472
Well, I'm really sorry
that I lied to you.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.349
I was trying to win over Alexis,

19:44.391 --> 19:47.186
and I thought I was doing the
right thing, and I was wrong.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.646
Apology accepted.
Alexis has a way

19:49.688 --> 19:52.566
of manipulating people,
which she weirdly thinks is

19:52.608 --> 19:55.777
one of her better qualities.
(chuckles)

19:55.819 --> 19:58.113
Wait, wait, wait.
That glass is filthy.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.657
Excuse me, could I get
a clean glass for my sister?

20:00.699 --> 20:02.659
Oh. You know,
I've always wanted

20:02.701 --> 20:04.244
an overprotective big brother.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.580
Well, here you go.
You can't get rid of me now.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.875
And you'll never drink from
a dirty glass ever again.

20:09.917 --> 20:12.002
♪ ♪

20:23.305 --> 20:25.766
I can't believe you would
stoop this low.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.726
Alexis, I don't know what
you're referring to.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.186
Of course you don't.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.354
It's probably not even
the most underhanded thing

20:30.395 --> 20:31.897
you've done today.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.608
Could you just email me
the rest of the insults?

20:34.650 --> 20:36.401
I'm in a bit of a rush.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.402
Hey!

20:37.444 --> 20:39.947
(glass shatters)
Oops.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.660
How clumsy of me.

20:44.701 --> 20:46.328
Stay away from my daughter.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.832
AMANDA:
I mean, have you spent
much time in London?

20:50.874 --> 20:54.962
Well, isn't this a lovely sight.

20:55.003 --> 20:57.130
I see you have a place
in your heart to forgive Amanda.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.549
I don't suppose there's any
good will left over for me?

21:03.512 --> 21:04.596
No.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.023
Thanks.
Yes, sir.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.316
What the hell was that?

21:16.358 --> 21:17.776
That dude needs to learn
when to move on.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.278
I said I didn't want
to talk about it.

21:19.319 --> 21:20.988
I've been working on this thing
for weeks,

21:21.029 --> 21:22.781
and you blew it up
in two minutes.
Relax, all right?

21:22.823 --> 21:24.825
It was one interview. You'll
find someone else for him.

21:24.866 --> 21:26.702
That one interview was
my only shot

21:26.743 --> 21:28.537
to convince Andre
to sign on for more.

21:28.578 --> 21:30.080
I needed this for the club,

21:30.122 --> 21:32.165
but I guess why would you
care about that?

21:32.207 --> 21:33.750
I'm sorry, all right?

21:33.792 --> 21:35.168
But I got my own stuff
to deal with right now.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.129
Right. Rockets to launch.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.922
I see now that you've
gone intergalactic,

21:38.964 --> 21:39.923
so has your ego.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.341
You just don't understand

21:41.383 --> 21:42.592
what I'm up against right now.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.553
I understand perfectly.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.388
I guess I was just hoping
that our friendship

21:46.430 --> 21:48.724
would allow you to care about
someone other than yourself

21:48.765 --> 21:49.891
for a moment.

21:49.933 --> 21:51.977
Clearly I was wrong.

21:54.813 --> 21:58.317
I promise I was not trying
to ruin your time with Adam.

21:58.358 --> 22:01.611
I saw an opportunity
to mend fences.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.071
Yes, my opportunity.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.323
My relationship with you
is not the only one

22:04.364 --> 22:05.699
that's important to me.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.368
I needed to get Adam alone,
away from Blake.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.871
He has poisoned my son
against me.

22:10.912 --> 22:12.372
Sounds a little bit dramatic,

22:12.414 --> 22:14.916
don't you think?
It's the truth.

22:14.958 --> 22:17.169
After our divorce,
he left me penniless;

22:17.210 --> 22:19.880
cut off all communication
with my children.

22:19.921 --> 22:22.007
I was living in a trailer,
for God's sake.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.925
Well, I don't know him
very well, but Blake doesn't

22:23.967 --> 22:27.095
strike me as cruel
or heartless.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.097
I'm sure there's more
to the story.

22:29.139 --> 22:31.016
And as Adam pointed out,

22:31.058 --> 22:33.018
you are very good
at manipulation.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.311
So anyway...

22:34.353 --> 22:37.230
There is more to the story.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.483
Blake has a very dark side.

22:39.524 --> 22:42.235
I hate to tell you this,
but one of Blake's

22:42.277 --> 22:43.987
former employees,
Nathan Macintosh,

22:44.029 --> 22:45.614
found that out the hard way.

22:45.655 --> 22:48.367
He crossed Blake,
and Blake killed Mac.

22:48.408 --> 22:50.285
Tossed him in Carrington Lake.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.329
He turned my children
against me,

22:52.371 --> 22:55.374
and he will try to do
the same to you.

22:55.415 --> 22:58.168
He's dangerous.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.504
That is not an update, Javier.

23:00.545 --> 23:01.838
That's exactly where
we left things.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.632
Keep trying.

23:03.673 --> 23:05.258
(sighs heavily)

23:05.300 --> 23:06.843
So, you already spoke to him?

23:06.885 --> 23:08.720
Adam was with a patient,

23:08.762 --> 23:10.305
and I didn't want to
stand there and wait

23:10.347 --> 23:11.848
while he's giving some lady
terrible news.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.475
He seems too busy.

23:13.517 --> 23:15.977
If he found time to have sex
with you in a supply closet,

23:16.019 --> 23:17.479
he'll find the time
to talk to you now.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.652
I'm scared, okay?

23:23.693 --> 23:25.112
Maybe we should leave.

23:25.153 --> 23:26.196
I don't want to have
this conversation

23:26.238 --> 23:27.197
in a hospital hallway.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.199
Girl, I've seen Gray's.

23:29.241 --> 23:32.411
This is exactly where
they work out their problems.

23:32.452 --> 23:34.579
Isn't that blanket meant
for newborns?

23:34.621 --> 23:36.790
Maybe, but it's freezing
in here.

23:36.832 --> 23:39.334
Look, apologizing isn't easy,

23:39.376 --> 23:41.378
but it's the only way
to make things right.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.004
Isn't that what you want?

23:45.632 --> 23:47.801
Fine.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.386
Go sit in the waiting room
until I'm done.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.346
Okay.

23:55.016 --> 23:57.185
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

23:57.227 --> 23:59.521
Um, Kirby, I don't think
this is the time or place...

23:59.563 --> 24:00.897
Please.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.608
You don't have to say anything.
Just listen.

24:03.650 --> 24:04.985
Okay.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.239
I'm listening.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.992
I am beyond sorry

24:12.033 --> 24:15.370
for the hurt
that I caused you.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.914
But I'm trying to own
my mistakes.

24:17.956 --> 24:21.793
I know you're angry...

24:21.835 --> 24:23.795
and I hope one day
you'll forgive me.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.173
I'm not angry.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.008
You're not?
No.

24:28.049 --> 24:31.219
No, I'm sad.

24:31.261 --> 24:34.097
Yeah, I'm-I'm sad that
this is where we've ended up.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.141
It's not where
I thought we'd be.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.976
You were my future.

24:38.018 --> 24:41.021
I was picking out
rings for us.

24:41.062 --> 24:44.441
You were the only person
who understood me

24:44.483 --> 24:46.401
and accepted me as I am.

24:46.443 --> 24:49.196
And that hasn't changed.

24:49.237 --> 24:52.741
And maybe we can still
be friends.

24:52.782 --> 24:54.659
Well, I accept your apology,

24:54.701 --> 24:56.286
but I don't think we can
be friends again.

24:58.205 --> 25:00.874
I'm-I'm sorry, Kirby.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.792
I'm... sorry.

25:08.256 --> 25:12.093
Quinn?! You work out
in the company gym?

25:12.135 --> 25:14.513
I guess being a board member
has its perks.

25:14.554 --> 25:16.515
I was wondering
when you'd find me.

25:16.556 --> 25:17.891
Guess I should be happy
you didn't corner me

25:17.933 --> 25:19.351
in the executive washroom.
(laughs)

25:19.392 --> 25:21.061
That was my next stop.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.479
I'll consider myself lucky.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.897
You, on the other hand,
messed up

25:23.939 --> 25:25.565
when you sold off
the radio division.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.275
You can't just go rogue.

25:27.317 --> 25:29.110
I like to think of it
as being aggressive.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.445
It's what leaders do.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.072
This company has done very well

25:32.113 --> 25:34.157
with me running things.
It has?

25:34.199 --> 25:36.159
Do you really want to
go into business

25:36.201 --> 25:37.744
with an uptight Brit?

25:37.786 --> 25:40.247
I mean, did our Founding Fathers
fight for nothing?

25:40.288 --> 25:43.917
Actually, my company's even
more profitable than hers.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.502
Colin.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.837
I didn't peg you
for a gym rat.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.923
I didn't peg you
to be an exhibitionist.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.926
News flash: women
can work out

25:52.968 --> 25:55.053
wearing whatever they want.
And you can go.

25:55.095 --> 25:58.682
Quinn has already decided
that I am the better person

25:58.723 --> 26:00.809
to lead this company
into the future.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.102
I'm not sure that's
where you're leading it.

26:02.143 --> 26:03.562
Okay,

26:03.603 --> 26:06.439
you two clearly have
some issues to work out.

26:06.481 --> 26:07.857
For the record,

26:07.899 --> 26:09.526
I'm still not sure
who I'm supporting.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.945
I'm starting to wish
there was a third option.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.076
Nice job.
Are you happy now?

26:18.118 --> 26:19.911
Not as happy as you.

26:19.953 --> 26:22.163
Clearly you drove Quinn away
just to be alone with me.

26:22.205 --> 26:23.540
(chuckles)

26:23.582 --> 26:25.083
Your obsession with me
goes back to Wharton.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.626
You're delusional.

26:26.668 --> 26:29.087
Not only have I never
been attracted to you,

26:29.129 --> 26:30.922
but I am currently
repulsed by you.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.841
My apologies.

26:32.882 --> 26:35.719
Guess I misread the situation.
Mm-hmm.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.766
It's rather warm in here,
isn't it?

26:46.980 --> 26:48.481
Oh!

26:48.523 --> 26:50.609
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna go.

26:50.650 --> 26:53.111
And look who's
the exhibitionist now.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.196
I'll see you
at the board meeting.

27:00.619 --> 27:01.995
You really think
she's your daughter?

27:02.037 --> 27:03.204
Yes. It all adds up.

27:03.246 --> 27:05.749
I understand,
but if you're wrong,

27:05.790 --> 27:08.293
I'm worried you'll get hurt.
Yeah, you might be right.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.670
But I have to go through
with this, I can't let it go.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.797
Not when there could be another
Carrington heir out there.

27:12.839 --> 27:15.258
Still searching for a new one.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.926
You know, I can't help
but get this feeling

27:16.968 --> 27:19.179
that you're disappointed in
the children you already have.

27:19.220 --> 27:20.972
I'll give you two
some time alone.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.559
Adam, you know
that's not true.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.603
Whether Amanda is
a Carrington or not,

27:26.645 --> 27:28.271
it won't change
our relationship at all.

27:28.313 --> 27:31.274
You're my son.
She'll never replace you.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.901
Thank you, Father.

27:32.942 --> 27:36.071
And if that is true,
then I may have found a way

27:36.112 --> 27:40.033
to get you the answer
you've been looking for.

27:42.243 --> 27:43.787
Amanda's.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.664
Took it from her purse
at La Mirage,

27:45.705 --> 27:49.250
dropped a few hair samples off
at the hospital on the way home.

27:49.292 --> 27:50.919
We should have an answer
in a few hours.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.880
Well done, son.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.760
What kind of bribe would
a sad yet rich

27:58.802 --> 28:00.220
middle-aged man like?

28:00.261 --> 28:01.888
I assume you mean Quinn?

28:01.930 --> 28:03.556
Not really my social circle.

28:03.598 --> 28:06.768
Maybe a Rolex.
No. Too predictable.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.436
I'd suggest a membership
to St. Andrews golf club

28:08.478 --> 28:10.730
in Scotland, but Quinn's
assistant just told me

28:10.772 --> 28:12.607
he now has one;
gift from Colin.

28:12.649 --> 28:15.110
I can't believe he's just
blatantly bribing him.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.112
I mean, at least I'm
trying to be subtle.

28:17.153 --> 28:18.530
You know what,
Colin is good,

28:18.571 --> 28:20.240
but there's no way
he's gonna beat me.

28:20.281 --> 28:21.741
Ladies.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.827
Fallon, I have tonight's menu
for you to look at.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.912
And by "look at," I mean approve
so we don't have another

28:25.954 --> 28:27.247
cauliflower steak incident.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.165
I'm sure it's great.
I trust you.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.584
Perfect. Save your enthusiasm
for tonight.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.211
We have drinks at 6:00,
apps at 7:00.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.755
Main course is set for
8:00 p.m. sharp.
Perfect.

28:35.797 --> 28:38.216
Oh, just one slight
issue with that.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.301
The only time Quinn could do
the board meeting

28:40.343 --> 28:41.636
was at 6:00 tonight.
I figured

28:41.678 --> 28:43.471
you'd want to keep him happy,
so I agreed.

28:43.513 --> 28:45.140
Oh, yeah, we can't move that.

28:45.181 --> 28:46.307
Um, Liam,

28:46.349 --> 28:48.435
I'm so sorry,
but I'm gonna be

28:48.476 --> 28:49.728
a little late, so, uh,

28:49.769 --> 28:51.855
you know, start drinking
without me.

28:51.896 --> 28:54.023
Or, I mean, why not move our
romantic dinner to the manor?

28:54.065 --> 28:57.026
Because the whole point was
to be outside under the stars.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.903
You know, to do something
different and exciting.

28:58.945 --> 29:00.155
FALLON:
Exciting? (scoffs)

29:00.196 --> 29:02.115
I have two hours
to save my company

29:02.157 --> 29:03.283
from the redcoats.

29:03.324 --> 29:05.034
Now, that is exciting.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.995
Look, I know you're
up against it with Colin,

29:07.036 --> 29:08.663
but sometimes it would be nice
to see you as excited

29:08.705 --> 29:10.540
about our marriage
as you are about work.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.000
Liam, that's not fair.

29:12.041 --> 29:13.585
No, look, it's fine.

29:13.626 --> 29:15.670
I know I'm fighting
a losing battle.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.255
It's just dinner, right?

29:17.297 --> 29:19.007
I'll see you at home.

29:22.886 --> 29:25.346
Don't feel bad.

29:25.388 --> 29:26.848
He just doesn't get it.
Obviously you have to

29:26.890 --> 29:27.974
stay focused on work
right now.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.894
Right. Focus.

29:30.935 --> 29:33.146
There must be some other gift
you can send Quinn

29:33.188 --> 29:34.272
to win him over.

29:34.314 --> 29:37.901
Actually, forget Quinn's gift.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.445
There's no point in fighting
a losing battle, right?

29:40.487 --> 29:41.488
You're just giving up?

29:41.529 --> 29:43.031
No, no.

29:43.072 --> 29:46.367
I have not yet begun to fight.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.999
Mr. Culhane, you had
a message from a Donny.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.459
He wants to know
what day is best

29:54.501 --> 29:56.169
for Andre's next podcast
here at the club.

29:56.211 --> 29:58.087
Next podcast?

29:58.129 --> 30:00.298
I think you got
that message wrong.

30:00.340 --> 30:03.635
No. She got it right.

30:03.676 --> 30:05.678
I'm the one who was wrong.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.931
You should call him back.

30:09.390 --> 30:11.017
You had something
to do with this?

30:11.059 --> 30:13.144
I made a few calls.

30:13.186 --> 30:14.687
Sent Andre some of
our new high-tech

30:14.729 --> 30:16.856
ColbyCo equipment
to film the series,

30:16.898 --> 30:18.608
and he was open to a redo.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.985
I wanted to make things right
between us

30:21.027 --> 30:22.737
after I screwed it all up.

30:22.779 --> 30:25.198
I appreciate it.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.158
But what happened with you?

30:27.200 --> 30:29.577
Why the meltdown?

30:29.619 --> 30:31.913
I lied to you about
getting the approvals

30:31.955 --> 30:33.414
I needed in Washington.

30:33.456 --> 30:36.626
The entire trip
was a bust.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.379
I sunk a fortune into
ColbyCo Space,

30:39.420 --> 30:41.297
and I still don't even have
a launchpad yet.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.550
Why didn't you just say that?

30:43.591 --> 30:47.762
Pride.
Embarrassment.

30:47.804 --> 30:50.390
I like to think I'm something
of a mentor to you.

30:50.431 --> 30:54.269
Someone to look up to.

30:54.310 --> 30:55.603
Didn't want to admit
that I failed.

30:55.645 --> 30:58.690
It's not a fail
until you give up.

30:58.731 --> 31:01.734
And Jeff Colby never gives up.

31:01.776 --> 31:05.113
Yeah, well...

31:05.154 --> 31:07.699
I guess there's a first time
for everything.

31:11.619 --> 31:14.497
COLIN:
So, as the majority
shareholder,

31:14.539 --> 31:16.708
I now call for
a no-confidence vote

31:16.749 --> 31:19.502
and urge the board to replace
Ms. Carrington

31:19.544 --> 31:21.379
with yours truly.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.756
QUINN:
Your track record certainly
speaks for itself,

31:23.798 --> 31:25.383
having turned
McNaughton Global Media

31:25.425 --> 31:28.469
into the empire
that it is today.

31:29.804 --> 31:32.640
I see no reason why we can't
vote on this matter immediately.

31:32.682 --> 31:34.475
Well, you seem to be
in a hurry, Quinton.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.519
Let me guess, early tee time
in Scotland tomorrow?

31:36.561 --> 31:38.938
It's nothing personal, Fallon.
This is business.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.316
No, business is always personal.

31:41.357 --> 31:44.611
But you're right.
Why wait? Let's vote.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.112
We don't even have to
leave the room.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.114
Okay. This should be quick.
QUINN: Indeed.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.824
By a show of hands,
all those in favor of

31:49.866 --> 31:52.535
Colin McNaughton becoming
the new chairman of

31:52.577 --> 31:54.537
Fallon Unlimited.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.125
Ellen, what's going on?

31:59.167 --> 32:01.461
All those in favor
of Fallon Carrington

32:01.502 --> 32:03.796
to remain as chairman.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.512
What just happened?

32:11.554 --> 32:13.765
I believe you lost.

32:13.806 --> 32:16.643
In America, we call it
a landslide.

32:16.684 --> 32:19.187
(forced chuckle)
Oh, but don't look so down.

32:19.228 --> 32:21.022
You still got
your buddy Quinn's vote.

32:23.524 --> 32:26.152
Finally unpacked?

32:26.194 --> 32:28.446
Yep. I'm ready to start
a new chapter.

32:28.488 --> 32:30.615
I feel good knowing all of
my amends are done.

32:30.657 --> 32:33.618
Really? All of them?

32:33.660 --> 32:36.037
Oh, no. Did I black out
and do something awful

32:36.079 --> 32:37.038
to a bellhop?

32:37.080 --> 32:40.166
No, there was no bellhop.

32:40.208 --> 32:43.002
But I'm the one who's been
driving you around for two days

32:43.044 --> 32:44.212
so you could do this.

32:44.253 --> 32:46.381
And I said thank you,
didn't I?

32:46.422 --> 32:48.633
And every time you did,

32:48.675 --> 32:50.593
I thought an apology
would follow.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.178
And then I thought, well,
maybe she's just saving

32:52.220 --> 32:54.138
the most important one
until the end,

32:54.180 --> 32:56.557
and yet, here we are,
at the end.

32:56.599 --> 32:59.227
You think I owe you
an apology?

32:59.268 --> 33:02.021
(scoffs)
Yeah.

33:02.063 --> 33:04.232
I mean, do you know how often
I was freaking out

33:04.273 --> 33:06.067
thinking I might lose
my best friend?

33:06.109 --> 33:08.361
I have completely neglected
my own life,

33:08.403 --> 33:09.862
including the hotel,
to help you.

33:09.904 --> 33:11.948
And I didn't ask you
to do any of that.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.074
Well, you shouldn't
have to, Kirby.

33:13.116 --> 33:13.992
That's what best friends
are for.

33:14.033 --> 33:15.743
I found you OD'd

33:15.785 --> 33:17.495
in a ratty apartment,

33:17.537 --> 33:18.788
and I thought you were dead.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.748
If you don't think
I deserve an apology,

33:20.790 --> 33:23.167
then you didn't learn
anything in rehab at all.

33:27.255 --> 33:30.717
I come in peace.

33:30.758 --> 33:32.218
(chuckles)

33:32.260 --> 33:34.303
I must say, that was
pretty smooth back there.

33:34.345 --> 33:36.723
How'd you pull it off?
It was simple, really.

33:36.764 --> 33:40.101
Once I realized I was fighting
a losing battle with Quinn,

33:40.143 --> 33:41.602
I focused my energy
on winning back

33:41.644 --> 33:43.021
all the other board members.

33:43.062 --> 33:45.356
And they turned, just like that?

33:45.398 --> 33:47.275
Well, after I promised
I wouldn't make

33:47.316 --> 33:49.027
any major decisions
in the future

33:49.068 --> 33:50.945
without board approval.

33:50.987 --> 33:53.072
Fallon Carrington
gave up control?

33:53.114 --> 33:55.575
Yep.
Didn't know you
had it in you.

33:55.616 --> 33:58.286
You impress me more and more.

33:58.327 --> 34:00.788
Yeah, well,
the feeling's mutual.

34:00.830 --> 34:04.042
You are the first adversary
I've ever had

34:04.083 --> 34:07.295
that's as focused
and ruthless as I am.

34:07.336 --> 34:09.464
I'm flattered.

34:09.505 --> 34:11.632
And since you won
fair and square,

34:11.674 --> 34:13.718
I'll sell my stock and
get out of your company.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.304
Or you could stick around.

34:16.345 --> 34:20.183
You know, strictly
as a consultant.

34:20.224 --> 34:21.893
If that's something
you'd be interested in.

34:21.934 --> 34:23.853
I suppose I could retain
a small amount of stock

34:23.895 --> 34:26.481
and keep my options open.

34:26.522 --> 34:28.357
I mean, obviously you're
desperate for me to stay.

34:28.399 --> 34:29.984
(laughs)

34:30.026 --> 34:31.819
A drink to close the deal?

34:31.861 --> 34:34.280
Um...

34:34.322 --> 34:37.742
I do have a dinner thing,

34:37.784 --> 34:40.453
but, um, yeah, yeah.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.038
I can spare an hour.

34:44.707 --> 34:46.501
We might make a
good team after all.

34:46.542 --> 34:48.419
I said consultant.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.388
(elevator chimes)

34:59.430 --> 35:00.765
What do you want now?

35:00.807 --> 35:02.433
I'm getting tired
of these house calls.

35:02.475 --> 35:04.477
That explains the bags
under your eyes. Where's Amanda?

35:04.519 --> 35:05.978
I thought I made it clear
I don't want you

35:06.020 --> 35:07.271
anywhere near my daughter.

35:07.313 --> 35:09.107
Correction.
She's our daughter.

35:09.148 --> 35:10.691
Blake, you don't know
what you're talking about.

35:10.733 --> 35:12.652
No, I know exactly what
I'm talking about.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.654
Amanda is my daughter.

35:14.695 --> 35:16.364
Excuse me?

35:19.242 --> 35:23.287
Are you saying that you're
my biological father?

35:23.329 --> 35:24.413
Amanda, ignore him.
I warned you,

35:24.455 --> 35:26.374
this man is nothing but lies.

35:26.415 --> 35:28.042
I know you don't have
any reason to trust me,

35:28.084 --> 35:30.211
but I do have something
you can trust, DNA.

35:30.253 --> 35:31.838
I had a sample
of your hair tested,

35:31.879 --> 35:33.047
and I'll take
a blood test as well,

35:33.089 --> 35:34.590
but yeah, it's true.

35:34.632 --> 35:37.218
It's all lies. Get out of
my house, do you hear me?

35:37.260 --> 35:38.761
I want you out!

35:38.803 --> 35:40.179
I am not gonna let you
keep me from my daughter.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.514
You understand me?
She deserves to know

35:41.556 --> 35:42.890
the truth about you.

35:42.932 --> 35:43.850
Oh, what would you know
about the truth?

35:43.891 --> 35:45.518
Enough! Enough!

35:45.560 --> 35:48.146
You are both behaving
like awful people.

35:48.187 --> 35:49.981
Alexis, I'm sure
your portrayal of Blake

35:50.022 --> 35:52.441
was embellished,
to say the least.

35:52.483 --> 35:53.985
And, Blake, what kind
of person steals someone's hair

35:54.026 --> 35:56.904
instead of just speaking to them
like a human being?

35:56.946 --> 35:59.240
Here's how this works
going forward.

35:59.282 --> 36:02.285
No more lies,
and no more manipulation.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.870
If I am gonna have
a relationship

36:03.911 --> 36:05.371
with either one of you,
it's going to be on my terms.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.498
Are we clear?

36:11.460 --> 36:14.088
You tried to keep her
from me and you lost.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.673
I'm gonna rebuild my dynasty,

36:15.715 --> 36:17.091
and Amanda is gonna be
a part of it.

36:17.133 --> 36:19.260
I will not lose
another child to you.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.888
I don't care what it takes,
even if it kills me.

36:21.929 --> 36:24.557
If you don't back off,
you may just get your wish.

36:30.146 --> 36:31.772
Thank you.
Eva?

36:31.814 --> 36:33.357
What are you doing here?

36:33.399 --> 36:34.817
Sorry to interrupt date night.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.152
I just need to see Fallon
for a moment.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.862
I thought she was
at the office with you.

36:37.904 --> 36:41.407
No. Oh, she probably went out
for celebratory drinks

36:41.449 --> 36:43.242
with some of the board members.

36:43.284 --> 36:44.327
She stopped the takeover
attempt.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.828
It was pretty amazing.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.580
Somehow I never doubted it.

36:47.622 --> 36:50.208
I'm sure she'll be home
in time for dinner.

36:50.249 --> 36:51.626
Or at least dessert
at the latest.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.294
Yeah. Thanks.

36:53.336 --> 36:56.130
Oh, I forgot to tell you
I found this great photo of us

36:56.172 --> 36:57.840
from your award ceremony.
Yeah?

36:57.882 --> 36:59.926
Here, I'll text it to you.
Give me your number.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.719
Sure.

37:01.761 --> 37:04.889
Oh, and would you mind passing
this file on to Fallon?

37:04.931 --> 37:08.184
I would stay, but
I have plans tonight.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.394
A moonlight hike
up on Kennesaw Mountain.

37:10.436 --> 37:12.480
I didn't know you were
the outdoorsy type.

37:12.521 --> 37:13.564
That sounds like fun.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.358
Yeah. Unfortunately, my friend

37:15.399 --> 37:16.901
flaked on me last minute,

37:16.943 --> 37:18.819
so I'll be alone with
a group I don't know.

37:18.861 --> 37:21.781
But, uh, the stars should
be beautiful tonight.

37:21.822 --> 37:23.741
Yeah.

37:23.783 --> 37:27.245
Uh, I better run.
Good to see you.

37:34.794 --> 37:37.672
(phone chimes)

37:41.050 --> 37:42.802
I thought you were
the main wholesaler

37:42.843 --> 37:44.262
of champagne in the city.

37:44.303 --> 37:45.680
How does two bottles help me
when there's

37:45.721 --> 37:48.266
a bridal toast in an hour
for 300 people?

37:48.307 --> 37:51.060
No, I don't want them.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.729
Hello? Hello!

37:53.771 --> 37:57.400
Ugh!
(sighs)

37:57.441 --> 37:59.860
What are you doing here?

37:59.902 --> 38:01.362
And have you seen Javier?

38:01.404 --> 38:02.571
He's chilling all the bottles
of champagne

38:02.613 --> 38:03.489
that just arrived
for the toast.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.616
Huh? What champagne?

38:05.658 --> 38:07.368
How do you know about that?

38:07.410 --> 38:09.078
And you still haven't told me
what you're doing here.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.039
I called in a favor from my
event coordinator days.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.332
It's the least I could do

38:13.374 --> 38:15.543
after monopolizing
all your time.

38:15.584 --> 38:17.169
Am I the only one
confused here?

38:17.211 --> 38:18.921
When I called the hotel
looking for you,

38:18.963 --> 38:22.091
Javier told me all about
your champagne problems.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.843
Which used to be
my favorite Taylor song

38:23.884 --> 38:25.011
until the last two days.

38:25.052 --> 38:27.680
I'm really sorry, Sam.

38:27.722 --> 38:29.640
You were right.

38:29.682 --> 38:31.726
I made amends to all the people
who were mad at me,

38:31.767 --> 38:33.602
but not the ones who
were worried about me

38:33.644 --> 38:35.104
and took care of me.

38:35.146 --> 38:38.607
I wouldn't be alive
if it wasn't for you.

38:38.649 --> 38:41.527
You're at the top of
all my lists.

38:41.569 --> 38:44.405
Thank you.

38:45.656 --> 38:48.159
That's all I wanted.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.578
That and to never talk
about champagne again.

38:50.619 --> 38:52.705
That works for me.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.252
What's this?

38:58.294 --> 39:00.588
It's great, how you want
to be my mentor and all.

39:00.629 --> 39:04.508
We're friends first.
In failure and success.

39:04.550 --> 39:07.136
You showed up for me.
I want to pay you back.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.929
Open it.

39:14.560 --> 39:18.147
Thanks, but I'm not looking to
get into the oil business.

39:18.189 --> 39:23.069
(chuckles) When I worked
for Blake as a driver,

39:23.110 --> 39:25.988
I got to know one of the
Carrington Atlantic engineers.

39:26.030 --> 39:29.325
Now, I remember him telling me
how C.A. used to sell

39:29.367 --> 39:34.288
their abandoned offshore rigs
as satellite launchpads.

39:34.330 --> 39:37.917
So if I can secure a rig
off the Georgia coast,

39:37.958 --> 39:40.669
I have my launchpad and I don't
have to deal with Washington.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.797
Nope. Just a Georgia senator

39:42.838 --> 39:44.590
that has to okay launching
from there.

39:44.632 --> 39:47.301
(laughs)
There is hope.

39:47.343 --> 39:48.928
Now, here's the part
you'll really love.

39:48.969 --> 39:51.639
If we throw our support
behind Blake's opponent

39:51.680 --> 39:53.682
in the senate race and he wins,

39:53.724 --> 39:57.019
Cavendish will owe us
a big favor.

39:57.061 --> 40:00.147
And as a bonus, we keep Blake
from getting into office.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.483
Two birds, one rocket.

40:02.525 --> 40:03.943
(laughs)

40:03.984 --> 40:06.904
BLAKE:
Thank you all for being here.

40:06.946 --> 40:09.156
Actually, we're here
for dinner.

40:09.198 --> 40:11.492
Which you won't let us eat until
you tell us your big news.

40:11.534 --> 40:13.661
Big news indeed.

40:13.702 --> 40:17.915
The Carrington family
is going to be expanded by one.

40:17.957 --> 40:20.793
No, not-not that.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.545
Recently, Adam and Fallon
found out that

40:22.586 --> 40:23.546
they have a half sister.

40:23.587 --> 40:25.005
Well, I'm here to tell you

40:25.047 --> 40:26.507
that she has been upgraded

40:26.549 --> 40:27.883
to full sibling.

40:27.925 --> 40:30.469
Amanda is my daughter,
and a true Carrington.

40:30.511 --> 40:33.681
Let's not forget she is also
Alexis's daughter.

40:33.722 --> 40:37.560
Yes, well, we take the good
with the bad, right?

40:37.601 --> 40:39.603
Now, I hope that
you will all welcome her

40:39.645 --> 40:41.105
with open arms.

40:41.147 --> 40:42.565
Sure. Sounds good.

40:42.606 --> 40:44.608
Can we eat now?

40:46.068 --> 40:48.654
I think you did
a great job, honey.

that romantic dinner
outside by the pool.

41:24.190 --> 41:26.233
