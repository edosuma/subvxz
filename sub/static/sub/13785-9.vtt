02:18.639 --> 02:20.598
One-third of six is two.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.477
The combination of the safe
in the hardware store,

02:24.645 --> 02:27.814
which you should commit
to memory against eventualities.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.566
As was threatened by the arrival
of those men last night.

02:30.734 --> 02:34.821
Yes. There are deeds,
some 7% bonds,

02:34.988 --> 02:38.282
certificates, sundry receivables.

02:38.450 --> 02:43.204
One-third of six is two.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.832
One-three-aught-six-two.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.792
Yes.

02:47.960 --> 02:51.087
The children and I are moving
into the new schoolhouse today.

02:51.255 --> 02:53.422
Good.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.011
I'll walk with you.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.683
I wish we'd found out the last part

03:03.851 --> 03:06.102
for Mrs. Bullock to tell the children.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.104
We did as best we could.

03:09.982 --> 03:12.316
Does four desks to a row seem right?

03:13.318 --> 03:17.280
Mm, if not,
they ain't nailed to the floor.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.284
You ain't seen Jane?

03:25.163 --> 03:27.832
Hearst:
The camp is to know they're here.

03:29.001 --> 03:32.211
The camp is to know
they're my employees.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.339
If this knowledge came first
from some disruption of traffic

03:35.507 --> 03:37.717
in the thoroughfare,
I would have no objection.

03:37.885 --> 03:41.596
- All right.
- And matters might deteriorate from there.

03:44.349 --> 03:48.019
- Coffee!
- Jewel: Ready.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.354
Well-positioned, Davey.

03:50.522 --> 03:54.525
- Yes, sir, Mr. Swearengen.
- Eyeing them idlers outside Hearst's hotel.

03:54.693 --> 03:59.572
Copperhead cocksucker Hearst--
bringing in the fucking Pinkertons?

03:59.740 --> 04:02.950
Not much of a horserace, Dan,
between the appetite for blood

04:03.118 --> 04:06.412
- and fidelity to a political conviction.
- Fucking Pinkertons!

04:06.580 --> 04:09.916
Do we have alternatives to enlisting
reinforcements in Cheyenne?

04:10.083 --> 04:13.044
I knew I should have stayed
packed from four days ago.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.922
Some bullshit's jumping off
on the thoroughfare, Mr. Swearengen.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.261
Get out of my way.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.972
Move it, old timer.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.896
Get out of the way, Hop Lee!

04:32.064 --> 04:33.564
Hang on.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.733
Cocksuck--

04:35.901 --> 04:39.236
- Move along, Ding-Dong! Move along!
- Cocksucker!

04:39.404 --> 04:41.447
- Move along!
- Cocksucker!

04:41.615 --> 04:45.493
- Move along, Ding-Dong!
- (Wu grunts)

04:45.661 --> 04:47.745
Go get fucking Wu.

04:49.915 --> 04:55.086
Question extant being: till reinforced,
can we learn the ways of church mice?

04:57.339 --> 04:58.339
(grunts)

04:58.507 --> 05:00.800
Call on Tolliver.

05:02.094 --> 05:05.471
You will not mistake
the newspaperman.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.307
He looks like a... big turtle.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.435
Published a letter
meant to embarrass me.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.063
That I authored his discomfiture

05:14.231 --> 05:17.650
should come clear only
as events cumulate.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.944
All right.

05:21.363 --> 05:24.907
At the top of my to-do list every morning
and every day it gets away from me.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.952
- Anyways, here you are.
- Here I am,

05:28.120 --> 05:31.622
Al's delegate-- as far as him
and you deal with Mr. Hearst.

05:31.790 --> 05:35.918
Will you still if invited to sit
or will it take me offering a meal?

05:36.086 --> 05:40.047
I'd sooner not sit, sir, and already ate.
Only asking, ought I bear a message to Al?

05:40.215 --> 05:42.508
Nothing comes to mind.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.636
Horsemen come to camp
by torchlight last night.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.222
Tell Al as we didn't
wake to the Apocalypse,

05:48.390 --> 05:50.933
I suppose all we need fear
is their Winchesters.

06:02.863 --> 06:06.323
The pillars of my existence
who should know each other:

06:06.491 --> 06:10.202
Mr. John Langrishe,
my dear Aunt Lou Marchbanks.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.330
With whose art I am most
appreciatively familiar.

06:13.498 --> 06:17.460
Mr. Langrishe is now to my back, Aunt Lou,
what you have long been to my belly.

06:17.627 --> 06:20.671
And I may say that so long
as the nodals are quiet,

06:20.839 --> 06:22.548
that girth at the midriff,

06:22.716 --> 06:26.844
preached as sin by so many among
the guardians of sacral well-being,

06:27.012 --> 06:29.680
is absolved as a danger by me.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.682
I've been heavy all my life.

06:31.850 --> 06:35.394
Oh, I refer not at all to you, dear lady.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.522
Salty, juicy ham this morning.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.191
I must have it.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.985
Usual for me, Aunt Lou.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.029
Sit sit sit sit.

06:45.197 --> 06:48.824
Must I do so four times?

06:48.992 --> 06:51.202
Ah, my closest confidant in the camp

06:51.369 --> 06:54.663
is Aunt Lou, and I say that
with every awareness.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.207
Wonderful.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.918
I guess I must have went
invisible over night.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.004
I saw you, drummer.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.048
And yet you cut in front of me.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.177
(groans)

07:08.345 --> 07:10.930
I just knew you wouldn't be eating.

07:13.892 --> 07:18.145
Did I not see the gentlemen who is
still upright arrive in the camp last night?

07:18.313 --> 07:20.731
I believe I may have as well.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.484
I was on the porch of this structure,

07:23.652 --> 07:26.320
and you with Mr. Swearengen
on his balcony.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.781
I believe he came in on horseback.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.991
Not as a pedestrian, ironically,

07:31.159 --> 07:33.744
given his heavy-footed virtuosity.

07:33.912 --> 07:37.581
What did Mr. Swearengen
make of the coming into camp

07:37.749 --> 07:39.917
of that man among his friends?

07:40.085 --> 07:42.419
Do allow me, Mr. Hearst,

07:42.587 --> 07:44.672
as your corporal comfort's advocate,

07:44.840 --> 07:46.423
in this regard to be neutral.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.426
Let me show in your company
on the subject of Al,

07:49.594 --> 07:52.930
no less rigorous a reticence
than I exhibit with Al

07:53.098 --> 07:56.267
when addressing the subject of you.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.519
Ah!

07:58.687 --> 08:00.437
My ham.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.663
- Alma: Good morning.
- Morning.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.125
Good morning, Louis.

08:21.293 --> 08:24.712
- I hope your night was uneventful.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.798
Jim's late, so I'll watch till he arrives.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.800
Thank you.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.385
How have you been, Trixie?

08:32.554 --> 08:34.597
No complaints...

08:34.764 --> 08:37.015
as if anybody would give a shit.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.144
I come to put in some money.

08:40.312 --> 08:41.979
I'm glad.

08:50.822 --> 08:53.324
(grunting)

08:53.491 --> 08:56.202
Oh shit!
You motherfucker!

08:59.206 --> 09:01.498
Whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa!

09:01.666 --> 09:05.419
I ain't no goddamn nurse!
I gotta see to my business in this camp.

09:05.587 --> 09:08.088
Tom's rules. You can't
set if you ain't drinking.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.840
He's buying for them that do.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.009
Yeah, uh, and what if he messes hisself?

09:12.177 --> 09:14.720
For them that wipes him off.

09:14.888 --> 09:18.057
I ain't seeing him out.
I ain't gonna fucking do it!

09:22.687 --> 09:24.480
Trixie: You seem better
of late at a distance

09:24.648 --> 09:26.982
than you appeared
when last seen up close.

09:27.150 --> 09:31.028
- And now that you've seen me up close?
- I get the same impression,

09:31.196 --> 09:34.490
particularly of a clearness at the eye.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.492
I am better.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.369
Jack:
Good morning.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.371
Anyways,

09:40.538 --> 09:43.040
there's 12 bucks
I deposit into my account.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.042
If the currency's counterfeit,

09:45.210 --> 09:48.045
my fucking Jew boss is the culprit.

09:48.213 --> 09:51.507
Do not, please, madam,
hasten your business

09:51.675 --> 09:53.717
- or abridge it.
- I don't need no receipt.

09:53.885 --> 09:56.720
I trust the lady.

09:59.432 --> 10:03.018
John Langrishe, madam,
of the Langrishe Theater Company.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.646
How do you do, Mr. Langrishe?

10:05.814 --> 10:09.692
Glad I'm well to bid you good morning.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.903
I'd undertake two transactions.

10:13.071 --> 10:16.073
Deposit of $4,000

10:16.241 --> 10:19.576
and the borrowing of like amount.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.121
Those would seem at cross-purpose.

10:22.289 --> 10:26.375
Theater types being
perceived as transient,

10:26.543 --> 10:28.127
nomadic--

10:28.295 --> 10:31.755
without stake, so to speak,
in a place's particulars--

10:31.923 --> 10:34.675
my redundant undertakings

10:34.843 --> 10:38.637
would allay mistrust of my kind

10:38.805 --> 10:40.764
endemic in such camps as these.

10:40.932 --> 10:44.601
Oh. (chuckles)

10:44.769 --> 10:48.731
No less weighty than my verbiage.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.818
You have your loan, Mr. Langrishe.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.404
A pleasure, Mrs. Ellsworth.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.870
By way of publicity,

11:03.038 --> 11:05.247
this evening we conduct
an amateur night.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.791
I wish to state, unequivocally

11:07.959 --> 11:12.463
with this imposing
gentleman as witness,

11:12.630 --> 11:16.258
I have no gossamer filament of doubt

11:16.426 --> 11:20.346
you have skills to delight and amaze.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.016
They have their fucking fun with you,

11:24.184 --> 11:26.769
and in the morning
they treat you like dirt.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.188
(snickers)
And you a fucking virgin...

11:29.356 --> 11:32.316
No, and not pretending to be.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.943
...to be wounded by her callous ways.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.988
All I'm saying is
she could have been nicer,

11:38.156 --> 11:40.949
and those steerers
more fucking polite.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.911
(whooping)

11:48.666 --> 11:50.501
- Assholes!
- Hey,

11:50.668 --> 11:53.629
we got a timber lease to work.
Get over there.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.681
(Wu mutters Chinese)

12:27.247 --> 12:31.041
Oh, yeah, I'm sure them scribblings is clear
as fucking rainwater to you, Johnny--

12:31.209 --> 12:35.629
he who was stymied by a couple
of fucking Xs and a goddamn straight line.

12:35.797 --> 12:39.049
Winks, grins, gives Wu the big okay.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.801
Okay.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.679
Johnny: If I recall
the drawing you're referring to,

12:43.847 --> 12:47.808
I believe the straight line signifying
the bar was first made out by me.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.561
As far as these pictures here, now I,

12:50.728 --> 12:53.730
not fathoming the full particulars,

12:53.898 --> 12:56.191
I feel I get the general drift.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.902
You best trot upstairs with Johnny, Wu.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.071
Show Al your work is finished.

13:01.239 --> 13:06.577
But remember, Al, he-- he ain't near
as quick as Johnny or fucking Jewel.

13:06.744 --> 13:10.539
No, Al might be confused and treat you
to a fucking ass-kicking.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.000
(speaks Chinese)

13:18.590 --> 13:21.967
Well, what does Tolliver know
of the guns come to camp?

13:22.135 --> 13:25.345
- He said he don't know nothing.
- And you fucking believe him, huh?

13:25.513 --> 13:29.266
I think, I did.
Felt like he is outside looking in.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.727
We ought to form a fucking club.

13:44.866 --> 13:48.619
Fucking Yankton's rejoined us,
for Christ's fucking sake?

13:56.461 --> 13:59.421
Must have finished
stealing from the Indians.

14:06.888 --> 14:09.223
Pinkerton:
Wipe your ass, Hiram.

14:09.390 --> 14:13.602
It feels strange at first,
but the shit protects against blisters.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.106
Ho!

14:21.194 --> 14:24.279
- Will you be here after work?
- If I am, will you suck my prick?

14:24.447 --> 14:27.950
Well, if you ain't and a fella
says "Hiram" is trying to find you,

14:28.117 --> 14:32.246
if he don't go on to call you a cunt,
he's cutting the message short.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.622
Wyatt:
Let's go, Morgan.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.791
What, was it him that got
you hooked on cocksucking?

14:35.959 --> 14:37.751
Get on the fucking wagon.

14:37.919 --> 14:41.338
I'll be here, Hiram.
Try some shit on them blisters.

14:41.506 --> 14:44.341
Let him fuck your ass.
He may raise your pay a quarter.

14:46.844 --> 14:50.055
You might already be too loose.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.309
See you this afternoon.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.478
(man crying)

15:00.984 --> 15:03.026
A room, if I may,

15:03.194 --> 15:07.197
unexposed to the gales which must
blow through that hole above us.

15:07.365 --> 15:10.909
Mr. George Hearst,
who is now the hotel's owner,

15:11.077 --> 15:13.537
put the hole in that wall.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.873
Jarry: Enhancing not at all for me
the prospect of a room

15:17.041 --> 15:20.794
- in the hole's proximity.
- Could I get a wheelbarrow or the like?

15:20.962 --> 15:24.673
Yes, sir.
Richardson! Wheelbarrow!

15:34.183 --> 15:36.476
Miss Stubbs?

15:36.644 --> 15:39.730
I guess you're near ready
to take the children over.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.524
Or are you ready now?
Do I keep you from it?

15:42.692 --> 15:45.402
Oh, I'm-- I'm taking the children
in an hour's time.

15:45.570 --> 15:49.031
Just now you give us happy
respite from our numbers.

15:50.867 --> 15:54.661
Anyways, Mose says the man was
a Norwegger from Wisconsin,

15:54.829 --> 16:00.709
built the building around the tree
so as to have sap on hand for syrup,

16:00.877 --> 16:04.212
which must taste like hell
for being burr oak, but...

16:04.380 --> 16:06.548
probably smells nice in a lamp.

16:06.716 --> 16:10.385
- Does anyone know why he left?
- No luck on that score.

16:10.553 --> 16:13.138
Far as that, we came up empty.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.806
It's too bad.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.809
It's freer rein for the children's
imaginations.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.395
Fewer facts, I guess, to trample.

16:20.563 --> 16:24.024
I hope that you'll
walk with us, Miss Stubbs.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.568
Oh...

16:28.905 --> 16:31.156
- Sure.
- Good.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.867
I'll see you in an hour.

16:42.210 --> 16:45.003
Alma: I recognize, Mr. Fields,
that in any foreseeable future

16:45.171 --> 16:47.673
Steve will not resume
operations of the livery

16:47.840 --> 16:50.759
or pay on his note to the bank.
Be assured I am grateful

16:50.927 --> 16:53.845
for the expedient care you have taken
of the livery and its occupants,

16:54.013 --> 16:56.431
having no obligation
in this matter of any kind.

16:56.599 --> 16:59.476
No shadow ought be
on Hostetler's reputation

16:59.644 --> 17:01.937
that sold to Steve
by me now taking leave.

17:02.105 --> 17:05.982
No reasonable person would cast one.

17:06.150 --> 17:10.069
I guess I can head out then
knowing the one in a 100 that is

17:10.238 --> 17:14.156
won't sully Hostetler's name.
I got a life to live of my own.

17:14.325 --> 17:17.285
As do all here in the camp.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.332
Sorry to hold you all up.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.045
(door squeaks)

17:29.257 --> 17:32.300
Jesus Christ, whoever thought
I'd come to write an article?

17:32.468 --> 17:35.679
- Have you a notice you wish circulated, sir?
- What?

17:35.847 --> 17:39.015
By "article" do you mean you have
some notice you'd wish published?

17:39.183 --> 17:42.102
By "article" I mean a fucking article.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.521
What would be your article's subject?

17:44.689 --> 17:47.983
You're a fat fucking bastard, ain't ya?

17:48.151 --> 17:51.695
I think we ought best continue
our conversation, sir,

17:51.863 --> 17:54.865
when you're not under
the influence of spirits.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.119
Something stupid looking about you.

17:59.287 --> 18:02.330
- I must insist you leave.
- Fucking irritating!

18:02.498 --> 18:05.542
- How you look makes me fucking embarrassed!
- (gasps)

18:05.710 --> 18:07.961
- Oh dear.
- "Oh dear"?

18:12.717 --> 18:15.302
Oh dear.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.596
(AW groaning)

18:19.557 --> 18:21.683
You'd better come help your friend.

18:21.851 --> 18:25.228
Mr. Merrick, I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry!

18:25.396 --> 18:29.858
Swedgin, Hearst, heng dai?

18:30.026 --> 18:32.486
We're the opposite
of fucking heng dai!

18:32.653 --> 18:36.198
- We're bok gwai lo, the two of us.
- Bok gwai lo?

18:36.365 --> 18:38.492
Fuck bok gwai lo!
We're not fucking heng dai!

18:38.659 --> 18:41.411
We're the opposite of fucking heng dai!
Now make your fucking point.

18:41.579 --> 18:44.956
Yah! Swedgin! Hearst! Eee!

18:45.124 --> 18:47.167
Jesus fucking Christ.

18:50.046 --> 18:54.049
Wu:
150 Chung Kuo cocksucker-- Custer.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.510
He's dead, for Christ's sake, Wu!

18:56.677 --> 18:58.845
Hey, how about the canoe?

18:59.013 --> 19:01.598
Did you know that had been
fucking invented yet, huh?

19:01.766 --> 19:03.934
Custer, Chung Kuo cocksucker,

19:04.101 --> 19:06.353
150-- Custer.

19:08.773 --> 19:09.815
Custer City?

19:09.982 --> 19:13.235
Oh! Custer City!

19:13.402 --> 19:16.780
Wu's holding his men

19:16.948 --> 19:20.200
- outside Custer City...
- Ahh.

19:20.368 --> 19:24.913
...'cause you and Hearst
are on the outs.

19:33.798 --> 19:36.967
Clever precautionary
fucking thinking, Wu.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.721
- Miss Stubbs.
- Mr. Utter.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.766
- Mr. Langrishe.
- The blessed Miss Stubbs,

19:44.934 --> 19:49.145
whose bust is so very prominent
in the mind's pantheon of the camp.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.398
Some not 50 yards from us

19:51.566 --> 19:54.484
will put these of mine to shame.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.030
As I've made to Mr. Utter

19:59.198 --> 20:02.158
a proposal the answer to which

20:02.326 --> 20:06.580
he must generate only
in privacy and after meditation.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.790
If you'll excuse, I'll take my leave.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.668
- Well, I will too.
- No no no, Miss Stubbs.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.921
It is only I from whom
he must be sequestered.

20:15.089 --> 20:18.341
Your counsel may be invaluable.

20:18.509 --> 20:23.138
If you can cartwheel
or puff your cheeks like a fish...

20:24.390 --> 20:26.725
we have a festivity tonight.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.728
I'll live in hope you'll attend.

20:37.445 --> 20:40.238
There is a strange fucking bird.

20:40.406 --> 20:44.034
Some kind of, uh, amateur night

20:44.201 --> 20:47.078
he's organizing,
connected with his theater

20:47.246 --> 20:49.539
some way I couldn't fathom.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.791
A prelude, he called it.

20:51.959 --> 20:55.045
Fucking Jane ought
to break out her bullwhip.

20:57.465 --> 21:00.300
I nearly came to know for Mrs. Bullock
to tell the children

21:00.468 --> 21:03.053
why that schoolhouse
has a tree growing through it.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.221
The new one has
a tree growing through it?

21:05.389 --> 21:09.559
Who the man was, why he'd built around
the tree instead of cutting it down.

21:09.727 --> 21:12.520
But Mose couldn't find out
where he'd got to.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.898
Why does she need to know
where the man got to

21:15.066 --> 21:17.859
for Mrs. Bullock to tell
the children about the tree?

21:18.027 --> 21:19.778
To finish the story.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.948
More than where the man
got to once he was through,

21:23.115 --> 21:26.284
I'd think the story was of the tree

21:26.452 --> 21:29.079
and the schoolhouse built around it.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.500
I guess you're right though.

21:33.668 --> 21:35.961
I-- I guess children are like that--

21:36.128 --> 21:38.546
wanting to know all the information.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.008
I guess that's how they are.

21:46.222 --> 21:50.976
You got something
to send, Miss Stubbs?

21:53.729 --> 21:55.981
I was just stopping by
to say good morning.

21:58.943 --> 22:01.486
Jarry:
Friends become adversaries

22:01.654 --> 22:05.156
become now, I hope, friends again.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.993
Doing any good for yourself?

22:08.160 --> 22:11.413
Oh, hard of late, Adams,
doing that in Yankton.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.165
That is something
you would be aware.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.584
From what I read on the crapper.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.671
Washington harasses us
for our difficulties

22:19.839 --> 22:22.424
in distribution to the Indians,

22:22.591 --> 22:25.135
thereby distracting the nation at large

22:25.302 --> 22:28.763
from Washington's own
fiscal turpitudes and miasms.

22:28.931 --> 22:32.600
There amongst the turpitudes and miasms,
you got caught stealing the money.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.811
The money was not stolen.

22:34.979 --> 22:37.564
There was an amount of siphoning off

22:37.732 --> 22:40.150
and certain irregularities.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.527
Sounds like it was
regular as milking Bessie--

22:42.695 --> 22:44.112
96¢ on the dollar.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.989
Rank exaggeration.

22:46.157 --> 22:50.493
If it was less than 90, you fucked
generations of Indian agents to come.

22:50.661 --> 22:54.831
If saying so will let us go on, then,

22:54.999 --> 22:57.459
yes, we stayed above 90.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.878
And did you lay a few cents by?

23:00.046 --> 23:01.838
A few. Never enough.

23:02.006 --> 23:04.674
Your star here is in ascension?

23:04.842 --> 23:06.509
I've been keeping busy.

23:06.677 --> 23:09.554
Tell me how.
Don't delete a single detail.

23:09.722 --> 23:13.641
That's a pretty taut line, Mr. Jarry,
not knowing how deep your hook's set yet.

23:13.809 --> 23:16.269
How deep would 500 set it,

23:16.437 --> 23:18.688
time being of the fucking essence?

23:18.856 --> 23:21.232
Hard to know till it's inside my pocket.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.990
I'd rather not produce it in this place.

23:29.158 --> 23:31.201
Worse gets produced here pretty regular.

23:42.463 --> 23:44.422
Much has been answered already.

23:44.590 --> 23:48.009
Little has fucking changed.

23:50.805 --> 23:53.056
AW:
Ugh, it was nightmarish.

23:53.224 --> 23:56.184
Whatever cogent purpose
the man may have had,

23:56.352 --> 24:00.230
his drunkenness kept him
from conveying, and yet

24:00.397 --> 24:04.400
I had the eerie sense
he knew what he was doing.

24:04.568 --> 24:07.695
- Maybe not so drunk as he seemed, huh?
- (moans)

24:17.790 --> 24:19.582
Details, sir.

24:19.750 --> 24:23.044
Did the newspaperman
try to defend himself?

24:23.212 --> 24:25.755
Did he beg you to stop?
Did he cry out?

24:25.923 --> 24:29.551
He said, "Oh dear." Was bleeding
and curled up like a baby.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.803
(laughs)

24:31.971 --> 24:34.347
I'm guessing your bottom rib
is cracked,

24:34.515 --> 24:37.058
and this contusion at your belly

24:37.226 --> 24:40.103
show the colors of the rainbow
before it's through with you.

24:41.272 --> 24:43.606
Apparently, my expiration
is not imminent.

24:43.774 --> 24:46.234
Doc: 'Course I'm wrong
as much as I am right.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.987
What purpose might the man have had,

24:49.155 --> 24:51.656
Al, in feigning drunkenness?

24:51.824 --> 24:55.410
Allow you to penetrate the pretense?
Teach fear while inflicting pain?

24:55.578 --> 24:59.164
You printed any letters lately, Merrick,

24:59.331 --> 25:03.293
that some miserable cocksucker would
send an underling to punish you for?

25:03.460 --> 25:05.503
- Bastard.
- Blazanov: I should be ashamed

25:05.671 --> 25:07.422
that I didn't come to help.

25:07.590 --> 25:10.008
I'm so sorry, Mr. Merrick,
my dear friend.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.093
Cut it the fuck out, the both of you,

25:12.261 --> 25:15.096
unless you want to act
to the cocksucker's purpose.

25:17.433 --> 25:20.310
This came for the cocksucker,
Mr. Swearengen.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.153
Take it to him.

25:30.321 --> 25:33.031
I'd like to punch him.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.950
Give him the fucking telegram--

25:36.118 --> 25:38.036
and no punching.

25:38.204 --> 25:42.498
Long pulls
on the laudanum as needed.

25:42.666 --> 25:47.128
Check out that sow Tina, Doc,
when opportunity presents.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.881
That ain't the whiff of roses
when she passes.

25:54.470 --> 25:58.306
- Have I bled on your bed linens, Al?
- You wouldn't be the first.

26:00.643 --> 26:03.311
- Shit.
- (hoofbeats approaching)

26:14.198 --> 26:16.199
Do yourself a favor, Sol.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.910
Stop thinking of that Derringer
as a problem solver.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.287
It solved several for me.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.961
Free fucking kindling,
if you have need for it.

26:28.128 --> 26:30.546
Our timber lease ain't
nothing but pecker poles.

26:30.714 --> 26:34.133
Let's see them blisters... Hiram.

26:37.263 --> 26:40.139
Aw! Son of a...

26:40.307 --> 26:43.393
Jesus Christ, Morgan!

26:43.560 --> 26:45.770
Stay inside. Stay in here.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.691
- Help me.
- I did, you motherless cunt--

26:49.858 --> 26:52.652
- to bleed out in the fucking mud.
- (gunshot)

26:52.820 --> 26:55.113
Stand away till I find out
what happened here!

26:55.281 --> 26:58.574
- That fight was fair.
- Pinkerton: Bullshit!

26:58.742 --> 27:02.912
- Corey was under orders not to draw.
- That man's gun's out of its holster.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.248
Was it you took it out
after he was down?

27:05.416 --> 27:06.666
Do you say I did?

27:06.834 --> 27:09.585
That saw me come from my store
as you came down the boardwalk?

27:09.753 --> 27:11.754
I say someone did.

27:11.922 --> 27:14.257
Corey had orders not to draw.

27:14.425 --> 27:16.342
(grunts)

27:16.510 --> 27:18.636
- You're fucking under arrest.
- What for?

27:18.804 --> 27:21.973
For interfering with a fucking peace officer.
Come with me for questioning.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.559
- All right.
- All right, Sheriff.

27:24.727 --> 27:27.103
Seth:
You tell your men to interfere--

27:27.271 --> 27:29.605
give me a reason to do what I want.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.775
- (knock on door)
- Cheyenne and Black Hills

27:32.943 --> 27:35.403
- Telegraph Company, Mr. Hearst.
- Mr. Blazanov.

27:35.571 --> 27:38.031
Telegram for George Hearst.

27:38.198 --> 27:42.160
I decline your gratuity, sir--
change in policy.

27:54.298 --> 27:57.633
So where you gonna
take this, Richardson?

27:57.801 --> 28:00.261
To finish curing in the smokehouse.

28:00.429 --> 28:02.680
How long are you gonna
leave it in there?

28:02.848 --> 28:04.557
Three weeks.

28:04.725 --> 28:06.768
How you remember
three weeks is up?

28:06.935 --> 28:09.896
The notch where I sleep

28:10.064 --> 28:14.650
beside the notches for my other hams.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.778
You getting the hang of this, Richardson.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.780
So next time I ain't gonna ask you.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.991
Only check did you make your notch.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.494
You'll find it made, Aunt Lou.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.542
Would you excuse us, sir?

28:31.710 --> 28:34.253
Yes.

28:42.930 --> 28:45.848
Odell is dead.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.104
Jesus, help me.

28:51.271 --> 28:54.065
They found him near
the road to Rapid City.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.943
How they sure it's Odell?

28:57.111 --> 29:00.029
The letters I gave him
were still on his person,

29:00.197 --> 29:03.825
and his Bible bore his name.

29:05.327 --> 29:06.953
Get away from 'round me, sir!

29:07.121 --> 29:09.205
You don't have to feign
strength with me, Aunt Lou.

29:09.373 --> 29:11.916
I ain't pretending shit!
Get the hell away from 'round me, sir!

29:12.084 --> 29:15.086
My God! Oh my God!

29:16.422 --> 29:19.006
(groans)

29:23.178 --> 29:25.012
Jane:
Get out of my fucking light.

29:25.180 --> 29:27.640
It's me.

29:27.808 --> 29:30.476
Who is me? The fucking eclipse?

29:30.644 --> 29:33.104
- Mose Manuel.
- Oh, really?

29:33.272 --> 29:36.899
I thought it-- it was Giganto...

29:37.067 --> 29:39.110
the runaway circus elephant.

29:39.278 --> 29:42.530
Miss Stubbs has been looking for you.

29:44.283 --> 29:47.577
Those kids need chaperoning
to the new schoolhouse, Jane.

29:49.246 --> 29:51.205
I cannot hear you,

29:51.373 --> 29:53.416
nor can I see you

29:53.584 --> 29:55.960
any longer.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.254
- You fucking drunken slob!
- No!

29:58.422 --> 30:00.882
(heaving)

30:04.928 --> 30:08.556
Get up and walk them kids.

30:08.724 --> 30:10.850
Okay, Giganto!

30:13.979 --> 30:18.691
Don't tusk me to death with your tusks.

30:25.532 --> 30:29.494
How long do I have
to assemble myself?

30:29.661 --> 30:32.413
- They'll be ready to go in a few minutes.
- Shut up.

30:38.337 --> 30:41.464
- (both crying)
- Richardson: I'm sorry, Mama.

30:41.632 --> 30:43.633
I'm so sorry.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.802
I can't take it. I can't take it.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.934
Who produced their weapon first?

30:53.101 --> 30:55.937
Wyatt: They say they come out
at the same time.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.397
We drew as one.

30:58.565 --> 31:02.068
- That's a fucking lie.
- Charlie: Come here a second.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.489
Shut up.

31:07.991 --> 31:11.077
- Are you as sure about your timber lease?
- What do you mean?

31:11.245 --> 31:16.499
As that this is truthful. Are you as sure
that lease ain't worth fuck-all?

31:16.667 --> 31:20.002
- Absolutely fucking certain.
- Then nothing holds you here.

31:20.170 --> 31:24.340
And arguing against you staying
is who this fuck-head works for,

31:24.508 --> 31:28.469
and the man you shot...
in the fair fight.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.391
Best you move on,

31:33.559 --> 31:36.852
- taking your genius brother with you.
- Morgan: Um...

31:37.020 --> 31:40.064
I ain't showed myself
to advantage here, Sheriff.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.568
I'm fully fucking aware.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.158
Martha:
Line up right there.

31:51.326 --> 31:54.537
Stop. You're gonna stop right there.
Right there, stop.

31:54.705 --> 31:57.331
Okay, step this way right here.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.129
Okay, step this way.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.383
(whispering)
Thank you.

32:07.551 --> 32:09.844
Stay close.
I might need you for support.

32:10.012 --> 32:12.263
I don't want to hold her hand.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.390
You can lock arms instead.

32:14.558 --> 32:17.810
(whispers)
Hey, okay, go ahead. Miss Stubbs?

32:20.230 --> 32:22.064
(bell ringing)

32:35.746 --> 32:37.830
Sheriff?

32:39.416 --> 32:41.375
Tell him I ain't coming for his lecture.

32:41.543 --> 32:45.087
Tell him I don't need it. Tell him if
my temper was gonna get the best of me,

32:45.255 --> 32:47.757
this cocksucker's brains
would be on the floor.

32:47.924 --> 32:51.969
Tell him I got it. All right?
Tell him I'm on top of it.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.561
(bell ringing)

33:04.358 --> 33:06.525
Sheriff.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.824
Your finish, Charlie.

33:13.992 --> 33:17.244
- I got it.
- I told Mrs. Bullock I'd walk with her.

33:17.412 --> 33:20.539
Well, go ahead.
And hello to Miss Stubbs.

34:25.272 --> 34:29.275
Man: Soap!
Soap with a prize inside!

34:29.443 --> 34:32.820
Guaranteed prize
in every case of soap!

34:32.987 --> 34:35.781
Soap! Soap with a prize inside.

34:35.949 --> 34:38.868
Jack:
Hello! As we have

34:39.034 --> 34:41.911
in Chicago, Denver

34:42.080 --> 34:44.081
and San Francisco,

34:44.248 --> 34:47.877
the Langrishe Troupe bids welcome

34:48.043 --> 34:50.504
to the Deadwood camp!

34:52.340 --> 34:55.885
Nights to come will
find us on the stage within.

34:56.052 --> 35:00.222
Our enactments may bring
an odd tear to thine eye,

35:00.390 --> 35:03.476
and may be relied upon
to produce guffaws

35:03.643 --> 35:05.311
and howls of laughter.

35:05.479 --> 35:09.398
This evening, however,
in memoriam of a passing colleague

35:09.566 --> 35:12.067
whose jocund spirit

35:12.235 --> 35:15.112
hovers over our gay fiesta,

35:15.280 --> 35:18.073
I will give you his favorite epithet:

35:18.241 --> 35:21.786
"All the world's a stage,

35:21.953 --> 35:26.081
and all the men and women
merely players."

35:26.249 --> 35:28.250
Tonight, we will be

35:28.418 --> 35:31.378
the audience to you.

35:40.764 --> 35:43.516
(footsteps approaching)

35:55.821 --> 35:58.072
How are you feeling, Aunt Lou?

35:58.240 --> 36:00.825
- I'm getting dinner ready.
- Don't.

36:00.992 --> 36:05.538
Isn’t right you serving supper
to strangers when you're in such grief.

36:05.705 --> 36:08.874
- I want to.
- No.

36:10.460 --> 36:13.045
Ahem!

36:14.548 --> 36:16.632
Kitchen's closed.

36:16.800 --> 36:20.469
The sustenance I would take
in any case, Mr. Hearst,

36:20.637 --> 36:24.765
like a newly-hatched bird,

36:24.933 --> 36:28.435
would come, I would hope,
from your mouth.

36:28.603 --> 36:30.437
(mimics bird screeching)

36:41.658 --> 36:44.118
Don't follow so damn close.

36:48.832 --> 36:52.126
Kill you if I could, George Hearst.

36:52.294 --> 36:56.255
Sir! Do your tumble!
Do you have a colleague?

36:56.423 --> 36:57.840
Tumble, sir! Tumble away!

36:58.008 --> 37:01.093
- (crowd cheers)
- Magnificent!

37:01.261 --> 37:04.096
Well done! Bravo!

37:04.264 --> 37:07.683
A round of applause
for our dueling gymnasts!

37:09.019 --> 37:11.770
And again, who's there next?

37:11.938 --> 37:15.065
Ah, pick of the week!

37:16.985 --> 37:19.153
On you go, sir.

37:19.321 --> 37:21.822
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo.

37:21.990 --> 37:24.325
Young lady, you'd raised your hand.

37:24.492 --> 37:27.494
I have a sense you might
favor us with a song.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.416
(singing gospel song)
♪ Jesus loves me ♪

37:32.584 --> 37:35.711
♪ This I know ♪

37:35.879 --> 37:40.299
- ♪ For the Bible... ♪
- Man: When my dad died, I didn't even cry.

37:42.510 --> 37:45.179
Here you are, I'll give you a dollar.

37:45.347 --> 37:47.598
You cry right for him right now.

37:47.766 --> 37:52.102
Jack:
Oh! Look at this! Look!

37:52.270 --> 37:55.064
- (applause and cheers)
- ♪ Is strong... ♪

37:55.231 --> 37:58.984
That is the best fucking thing

37:59.152 --> 38:01.820
- I have ever heard in my life!
- ♪ Yes, Jesus loves me-- ♪

38:01.988 --> 38:05.157
- Indeed it is, sir!
- Get off me, sir!

38:05.325 --> 38:07.701
Jack: Thank you, young lady,
thank you!

38:07.869 --> 38:09.954
(laughing)

38:11.414 --> 38:14.750
Hell, it's easy for you.
You didn't know the cocksucker.

38:19.005 --> 38:21.465
(laughing)

38:26.805 --> 38:28.347
What's the upshot?

38:28.515 --> 38:30.265
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

38:30.433 --> 38:33.352
I was arrested, I was locked up.
What's the upshot?

38:37.148 --> 38:39.024
Charlie:
Go and sin no more.

38:44.197 --> 38:48.409
- Go ahead, Charlie.
- Where?

38:48.576 --> 38:51.996
Go ahead to the fucking
amateur night.

38:54.624 --> 38:56.417
You don't mind?

38:56.584 --> 38:58.335
All right.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.381
I believe I'll attend badgeless,

39:02.549 --> 39:06.510
lest I put a damper
on stupidities. (chuckles)

39:11.057 --> 39:12.850
Hmm.

39:13.018 --> 39:14.351
(gasps)

39:14.519 --> 39:17.312
Hmm.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.900
(gasps)

39:22.068 --> 39:25.070
Grandpa's trick.

39:25.238 --> 39:27.573
It is, yes.

39:27.741 --> 39:30.743
And we oughtn't to let
that spoil it for us.

39:30.910 --> 39:34.496
Jack: Such elegance!
Such dexterity!

39:35.790 --> 39:38.584
Ah, magnifico, magnifico!

39:38.752 --> 39:41.754
Let's hear it for the lariat lad.

39:49.012 --> 39:51.764
Get outta here
with that fucking nonsense.

39:51.931 --> 39:54.725
Get outta here before
I cut your fucking throat!

39:56.728 --> 40:00.522
Go on! Fucking amateur night.

40:00.690 --> 40:03.067
Some people gotta...

40:03.234 --> 40:05.694
fucking work, hmm?

40:05.862 --> 40:07.863
(audience applauding in distance)

40:09.574 --> 40:12.701
Claudia: Look at this!

40:12.869 --> 40:14.870
(people laugh and cheer)

40:18.041 --> 40:20.584
Jack:
A mystery from the East.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.753
(drum beating)

40:46.778 --> 40:48.403
Magnificent, young lady.

40:51.741 --> 40:54.493
Jack: Well done, young lady.
Well done, well done.

40:54.661 --> 40:57.746
- (audience cheers)
- Ah!

41:01.417 --> 41:03.460
Little fucking James, huh?

41:03.628 --> 41:06.088
He is a chatterbox.

41:06.256 --> 41:10.425
"Why why why?" Shut the fuck up
and maybe you'll find out.

41:10.593 --> 41:13.971
He liked the tree house most of any.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.849
What's a tree house doing
way the fuck up there?

41:17.016 --> 41:19.268
I like them school kids.

41:19.435 --> 41:22.104
Jack:
Well done, well done. Ah!

41:22.272 --> 41:24.606
Orbs of gold!

41:24.774 --> 41:28.277
- The wonderful Mr. Richardson...
- (crowd cheers)

41:28.444 --> 41:31.363
...and his magic orbs.

41:31.531 --> 41:33.323
And again, sir, and again.

41:33.491 --> 41:36.785
And again, sir! Hidden talents!

41:36.953 --> 41:38.537
Richardson!

41:40.874 --> 41:44.001
- You're done.
- (crowd booing)

41:46.004 --> 41:48.922
Envy is a cardinal sin, Mr. Farnum.

41:49.090 --> 41:51.049
Cardinal sin.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.680
How many are they?

41:56.848 --> 42:00.601
265 soldiers have bivouacked
near Sturgis now.

42:00.768 --> 42:05.063
Another 200 could be brought
to the Hills if needed.

42:05.231 --> 42:08.066
Why can't the soldiers
near Sturgis vote twice?

42:08.234 --> 42:12.529
Reinforcements are available should
poll watchers prove hostile to repeaters.

42:12.697 --> 42:15.741
Come forward, God damn it.
My back fucking worsens.

42:15.909 --> 42:18.744
I am so sorry, sir.

42:18.912 --> 42:21.914
Better you dizzy than me have
to turn around and look at you.

42:22.081 --> 42:27.044
These votes will support
candidates of your preference

42:27.212 --> 42:31.256
in each office, Mr. Hearst,
as if cast by you yourself.

42:31.424 --> 42:34.009
My stringent instruction
from Governor Pennington

42:34.177 --> 42:36.720
is to convey upon my return

42:36.888 --> 42:39.890
a confirmation in your hand

42:40.058 --> 42:42.559
that we have had this conversation.

42:42.727 --> 42:46.188
Then the Governor in turn
confirms the rumor he's a moron.

42:46.356 --> 42:48.023
(Jarry laughs)

42:48.191 --> 42:49.691
My heavens, no.

42:49.859 --> 42:53.445
I don't mean that he would
seek your signature

42:53.613 --> 42:57.115
on any itemizing of particulars,

42:57.283 --> 43:01.328
merely to confirm
the fact that I spoke to you.

43:03.915 --> 43:06.041
Jane:
Oh my God.

43:06.209 --> 43:08.543
Cy: Oft confused
with the Most High,

43:08.711 --> 43:12.422
though our inseams
got different lengths.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.466
Fuck you. Fuck you!

43:15.635 --> 43:17.552
(broom clatters)

43:21.015 --> 43:22.724
You can't come in here, Cy.

43:22.892 --> 43:24.768
I suppose I could if I want to.

43:24.936 --> 43:27.771
If you need us to talk,
we can do it somewheres else.

43:27.939 --> 43:30.691
- It ain't for you to come in here.
- Fuck you, Joanie Stubbs,

43:30.858 --> 43:34.444
and your fucked-out whore's thinking
what's mine to come into and ain't.

43:36.239 --> 43:38.073
Come on, girl.

43:38.241 --> 43:41.535
Come on close.

43:43.162 --> 43:45.247
Come on.

43:48.042 --> 43:51.378
Mose! Help, Miss Stubbs.
I'm too afraid.

43:56.467 --> 43:58.218
What a lovely tree

43:58.386 --> 44:01.346
inside a building.

44:02.849 --> 44:05.684
Is that a darling fucking tree house

44:05.852 --> 44:08.520
in the precious fucking branches

44:08.688 --> 44:10.647
for the shitheel little kids

44:10.815 --> 44:13.233
to play amongst in jolly joy?

44:15.028 --> 44:18.613
Get away, you!

44:18.781 --> 44:22.451
- Well now, Mose.
- Go on!

44:22.618 --> 44:25.287
You fat bastard.

44:25.455 --> 44:28.790
I'll hold your heart in my hand
for your beady little rat eyes to look at

44:28.958 --> 44:30.876
before I shove it
down your fucking throat!

44:31.044 --> 44:32.210
Cy!

44:37.091 --> 44:40.177
I wonder how till tonight I found
my way in the world at all,

44:40.345 --> 44:43.347
not having my steps directed
at every fucking quarter.

44:43.514 --> 44:47.893
- Go along.
- I got fucking places to go.

44:56.319 --> 44:58.779
(school bell rings)

45:12.335 --> 45:15.337
Isn’t this fun, man? Huh?

45:15.505 --> 45:18.173
Jack:
Ah! The camp giant!

45:18.341 --> 45:20.592
(audience cheers)

45:22.053 --> 45:24.346
Oh!

45:24.514 --> 45:26.348
What a figure.

45:26.516 --> 45:30.018
What a figure.
Look at this! Look at this!

45:30.186 --> 45:33.522
Look at that,
ladies and gentlemen.

45:36.067 --> 45:38.652
Well done. Bravo bravo.

45:38.820 --> 45:41.863
Bravo. Magnificent.

45:42.031 --> 45:44.032
- Ah!
- Look at that.

45:45.368 --> 45:47.202
