00:00.600 --> 00:01.440
I'm hank.

00:01.609 --> 00:05.770
I was your typical emergency
room doctor.Until I got fired.

00:05.950 --> 00:08.880
You let a billionaire hospital trustee
die to save some kid off the street.

00:09.070 --> 00:09.840
I made a judgment call.

00:09.840 --> 00:10.900
You made a mistake.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.640
This is my brother.I'm
evan R.Lawson,C.P.A.

00:13.770 --> 00:17.440
He took me away from my
troubles and to the hamptons.

00:17.600 --> 00:21.030
And suddenly,I had a chance to
become a whole new kind of doctor.

00:21.120 --> 00:25.920
Turns out the wealthy and not so wealthy out
here could use a guy who makes house calls.

00:25.970 --> 00:30.320
So I got a second chance
to do what I do best.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.070
Obviously,thhae s to be something else.

00:34.230 --> 00:37.090
It's just not name change and arrested!

00:37.250 --> 00:38.550
There has to be something else.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.620
Mm,god,this is such good television.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.540
Isn't it your job to sort
through company email?

00:43.680 --> 00:44.820
There is no email on sundays.

00:44.940 --> 00:46.770
I think you're thinking of mail.

00:46.770 --> 00:49.080
Uh,I think it's my job.I should know.

00:49.230 --> 00:51.640
You look cozy over there.Can
I get you anything else?

00:51.770 --> 00:54.090
Cucumber eye pads,a chinese foot rub?

00:54.200 --> 00:56.190
I am finally starting to
feel at home around here.

00:56.330 --> 00:57.320
Oh,yeah?Oh,good.

00:57.450 --> 01:00.460
'Cause I was worried whether you'd
survive the adjustment to all this.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.370
I think I've earned a day off,hank.

01:02.500 --> 01:06.670
Cash flow is up 25%,fixed costs are
down 10%,we have a healthy reserve,

01:06.810 --> 01:08.740
and I finally started to put
our capital to work for us.

01:08.830 --> 01:10.270
Is it working as hard as you?

01:10.400 --> 01:11.500
It's working.

01:11.620 --> 01:14.580
I'm investing our way towards a
bigger business and a higher life,hank.

01:14.710 --> 01:16.690
Pretty soon,boris is gonna
be living in our guest house.

01:16.820 --> 01:19.300
Yeah,you might want to explain
all that to our medical supplier.

01:19.420 --> 01:24.460
Apparently,the check you wrote them for
our new portable ekg machine just bounced.

01:24.820 --> 01:29.560
Yeah,well... you see,this is why you
never read company emails on sundays,okay?

01:29.670 --> 01:31.500
I'm gonna be reading up on boris.

01:31.610 --> 01:32.800
Fix this,evan.

01:32.930 --> 01:36.270
All right,I'm all over it.Trust
me.First thing tomorrow morning.

01:36.380 --> 01:39.040
And don't wait till tomorrow.

01:45.980 --> 01:49.070
So I know you're busy studying
100 years of german medical data,

01:49.220 --> 01:52.450
but,uh,there actually is one hankmed
concern that's been on my mind today.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.400
Spokesmodel,corporate jet,or
commercial during the super bowl?

01:55.530 --> 01:58.360
None of the above.It's divya.

01:59.860 --> 02:00.830
What about her?

02:00.950 --> 02:02.530
Should we discuss what our plan is?

02:02.660 --> 02:05.230
Our plan is to talk to
her,see what her plan is.

02:05.370 --> 02:07.010
Okay,but what if she decides to do this?

02:07.240 --> 02:09.440
If she gets engaged and moves
to london,what are we gonna do?

02:09.660 --> 02:12.490
Well,we'll find another P.A.,I guess.

02:12.650 --> 02:14.110
So you're not worried at all?

02:14.240 --> 02:15.860
I said we'd find another P.A.

02:16.030 --> 02:18.700
I didn't say we'd find another divya.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.580
Hill manor.Sound like a serious joint.

02:21.700 --> 02:25.270
You fired up for the social
event of the season,henry?

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:37.080 --> 02:39.520
Zoey?

02:41.800 --> 02:45.410
Where are you going this time,huh?

02:58.310 --> 03:00.940
Zo?

03:08.310 --> 03:11.640
Zoey,honey,let's get you back to bed.

03:14.740 --> 03:18.740
Zoey?Honey?

03:21.180 --> 03:23.540
No,zoey,stop!

03:56.550 --> 04:01.660
As we discussed,a full service bar
will be set up there,in the courtyard...

04:01.810 --> 04:05.880
and out there,on the great
lawn,next to the ceremony tents.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.620
No one will be waiting for drinks.

04:08.800 --> 04:14.020
Also,the dance floor will
be up here in the courtyard.

04:16.310 --> 04:18.040
Crazy wedding here last night?

04:18.190 --> 04:20.290
Just a small maintenance operation.

04:20.410 --> 04:22.150
What kind of operation?

04:22.300 --> 04:23.950
We're cleaning the manor house.

04:24.050 --> 04:26.980
We're cleansing  the manor house.

04:27.140 --> 04:28.020
I'm sorry?

04:28.030 --> 04:32.370
Look,ms.Katdare,we promise everything will
be back to normal in time for your party.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.490
Zoey,why don't you show
them the great lawn?

04:34.640 --> 04:36.030
I was just about to.

04:36.210 --> 04:39.880
Um,divya,a word,please.

04:41.090 --> 04:44.230
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

04:44.360 --> 04:46.440
No matter how badly
our parents want this,

04:46.590 --> 04:50.620
they wouldn't let us throw a tailgate party
here,let alone our sakharpuda ceremony.

04:50.790 --> 04:51.870
Right.So...

04:51.990 --> 04:54.790
but maybe the montauk yacht club
has a last minute cancellation.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.470
I'll call the event manager there.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.180
You resume the tour of amityville.

04:59.310 --> 05:02.410
This place seemed so normal when my
sister got married here three years ago.

05:02.590 --> 05:07.060
Hi,um,I was wondering if you had
space for a last minute event.

05:07.190 --> 05:10.900
Let's talk about this later.

05:11.020 --> 05:11.880
Sorry about that.

05:12.020 --> 05:19.100
No,please,look,ms.Katdare,we will have everythingcleaned
up in time for your veryspecial occasion.

05:19.260 --> 05:23.490
You and mr.Bandyopadhyay
seem likethe perfect couple,

05:23.620 --> 05:26.480
and you deservea truly perfect affair.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.530
Should we continue walking?

05:31.910 --> 05:33.240
Are you okay down there?

05:33.360 --> 05:35.890
Oh,yeah,it's  it's no big deal.

05:36.030 --> 05:38.370
May I?

05:42.470 --> 05:45.510
It's no small deal.

05:46.010 --> 05:47.800
Okay,neither is that.

05:47.930 --> 05:48.780
Have you seen a doctor?

05:48.900 --> 05:50.780
Oh,the cough.Yeah,it comes and goes.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.320
And this just happenedlast night.

05:52.450 --> 05:56.970
Well,let's pausethe party
planning for a moment.Shall we?

05:57.450 --> 06:00.780
So...how did thishappen,zoey?

06:00.920 --> 06:02.240
It's gonna soundvery strange.

06:02.350 --> 06:03.970
The houseis doing this to her.

06:04.100 --> 06:04.820
One more time.

06:04.940 --> 06:06.600
Every night,I see things.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.140
Really...indescribable things.

06:09.300 --> 06:16.200
And last night,I followed one of
them right through that window.

06:16.340 --> 06:18.910
And why would the housebe
making this happen?

06:19.040 --> 06:23.070
Well,amy thinksit's
because I want to expand.

06:23.180 --> 06:25.800
Turn this place into a full
servicebed and breakfast.

06:25.940 --> 06:28.670
And the housewants you to stay
focused on events and catering.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.660
This househas been in our
family for five generations.

06:31.780 --> 06:37.220
Ever since our great,great grandparents came here
from scotlandand built it with their bare hands.

06:37.340 --> 06:48.170
Amy...   any radical changeto that now would
be an insultto them and what they left behind.

06:49.050 --> 06:51.520
My sister's a littleoff
center sometimes.

06:51.660 --> 06:56.440
Oh,I know how you feel.My brothercouldn't
find the center with a G.P.S.Device.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.450
How long has thisbeen going on?

07:03.630 --> 07:04.530
A couple weeks.

07:04.670 --> 07:09.840
You've been hallucinating every nightfor
two weeks,and you haven'tseen a doctor?

07:10.030 --> 07:13.150
Let me take the sharps.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.990
Thank you.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.360
There are two options here.

07:19.530 --> 07:25.360
Either my sister's right,
or I'm losing my mind.

07:25.490 --> 07:30.100
I don't think I couldhandle
finding out either one is true.

07:30.230 --> 07:32.600
Look no oneshould have to feel
like they're crazy or,even worse,

07:32.750 --> 07:34.320
like their sibling was
rightabout something.

07:34.460 --> 07:39.450
I personally don't havemuch experience with
the latter,but I imagine the painis unbearable.

07:39.550 --> 07:42.250
Excruciating.

07:42.360 --> 07:47.930
So... we better find youa third option.

07:48.060 --> 07:53.570
No signs of papilledema,so probably no increased intracranial...
no abnormality of the soft palate muscles.

07:53.730 --> 07:55.530
No masses in the neckor thyroid.

07:55.810 --> 07:58.950
Deep breath in.Out.

07:59.090 --> 08:00.140
Lungs,heart,abdomen are normal.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.510
Count backwards from 100by sevens.

08:02.660 --> 08:08.110
-93,86,79,72
-okay,no cognitiveimpairment.

08:08.260 --> 08:11.730
No explanationfor the odd mixture
of coughingand hallucinating.

08:11.860 --> 08:13.480
Time to take it upa notch.

08:13.630 --> 08:17.440
I'll geta ct scanner over here.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.190
Charlie...

08:41.539 --> 08:44.039
You're on the cutting
edgeof home security,jill.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.270
You gonna detain me in a
buckettill the cops arrived?

08:46.390 --> 08:47.790
What are you doingin my house?

08:47.920 --> 08:49.660
Doro alicha.

08:49.770 --> 08:53.180
Ethiopian chicken stew.It's
traditional,but lively.

08:53.310 --> 08:55.480
-I'm not hungry.
-Mm,I am.

08:55.600 --> 09:00.060
You know,ever sinceI,spent my life savings
treating indigent peoplesacross the planet,

09:00.190 --> 09:02.480
I came back and had to
crashat the hospital.

09:02.620 --> 09:03.820
You been sleeping there?

09:03.920 --> 09:07.830
Oh,yeah,and as muchas I love the amenities,
found myself cravinga home cooked meal.

09:07.950 --> 09:11.300
So I couldn't helpbut
wonder,why not live at home?

09:11.450 --> 09:14.130
Uh,because this isn'tyour home anymore.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.700
-Check the mortgage agreement.
-Check the mortgage payments.

09:17.810 --> 09:20.730
Listen... I know I owe you some money.

09:20.850 --> 09:22.440
But here I am,working it off.

09:22.540 --> 09:28.320
Plus,wouldn't it be easierfor us to... attend to
allour social obligations if we were under one roof?

09:28.420 --> 09:29.670
Oh,my motorcycle'sacting up.

09:29.910 --> 09:31.010
You're,um,you'regonna have to drive us.

09:31.130 --> 09:33.300
Yeah,I'll beattending this party solo.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.980
Thought you said you
wereopen to a resolution.

09:35.070 --> 09:37.150
Yeah,not whenyou force feed me.

09:37.290 --> 09:41.810
Look,charlie,a lot happenedafter
you left.I moved on.

09:41.920 --> 09:48.000
Jill,a man,uh... travels the
worldin search of what he needs.

09:48.130 --> 09:52.350
And then he returns hometo find it.

09:52.520 --> 09:57.110
So you sort it outall you want,'cause
when you're done,I'm gonna be right here...

09:57.250 --> 10:02.140
showing youjust how different
things are gonna bethis time around.

10:02.470 --> 10:04.550
Well,ct was clean.

10:04.680 --> 10:09.400
No bleeds or lesions.Electrolytes
are normal,and sugar's 102.

10:09.540 --> 10:12.670
She's slightly anemic.But that's
nothing abnormal for a 29 year old woman.

10:12.790 --> 10:17.520
I think we need to lookinto environmental
toxins or an infectious source.

10:17.640 --> 10:21.810
Given her sister's beliefs,should
we be lookingat psychiatric disease?

10:21.940 --> 10:23.190
Maybe something genetic.

10:23.320 --> 10:27.090
Look,I checked.No family history.Let's
rule outall organic causes first.

10:27.220 --> 10:31.740
After all,except for the coughing,zoey looks
fine right now.No hallucinations at all.

10:31.900 --> 10:35.110
-Good,I'll get theseto the lab.
-Good.

10:35.270 --> 10:36.830
Hallucinations?

10:36.950 --> 10:38.830
That's the clinical term,yes.

10:38.940 --> 10:40.320
That'sthe unenlightened term.

10:40.420 --> 10:43.420
Well,enlighten me,please.

10:44.450 --> 10:51.050
20 years ago,we lost our parentsto an accident...
to a drunk driver out on montauk highway.

10:51.160 --> 10:55.630
The very next day,I woke
up and felttheir presence.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.530
This is gonna soundstrange to
you,but I couldhear them speaking.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.210
That's whatgot me through it.

11:01.340 --> 11:04.680
And...I'm whatgot zoey through it.

11:04.810 --> 11:08.260
Okay,and what do you
thinkis happening here?

11:08.400 --> 11:11.080
She's being hauntedby her own instincts.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.680
This house is sacred.And
she should know it.

11:13.750 --> 11:14.900
I have a proposal,amy.

11:14.990 --> 11:19.780
You stay open mindedto my theories,
and I'll stay open mindedto yours.

11:19.900 --> 11:21.370
Okay,here's my theory.

11:21.480 --> 11:28.290
Zoey will be fine as soon as she gives upher plan to
turn our family's home into a bunchof rooms for rent.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.600
-What's your theory?
-I don't have one yet.

11:31.730 --> 11:36.000
But zoeyasked me to find one,
and I won't give upuntil I do.

11:40.150 --> 11:45.240
Someone close to you.Someone
who looks like you.

11:45.390 --> 11:46.900
Someone with a letter "R.

11:47.050 --> 11:50.690
My brother.Evan R.Lawson?

11:50.820 --> 11:53.980
He's getting himselfinto trouble.

11:54.110 --> 11:57.700
Sorry,amy,you don'tneed
a gift to sense that one.

11:57.840 --> 12:01.690
Sir,I'm telling you it's a
clerical error.Okay,it's a big one.

12:01.810 --> 12:07.170
I'm the cfo of the company.I didn't conduct or
approve any of these withdrawals or transfers.

12:07.320 --> 12:11.610
Well,of courseyou can do
something.You're the bank manager.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.340
Yes,I'll hold again.Awesome.

12:13.460 --> 12:14.790
'Cause whenall my money's
missing,there's nothing

12:14.790 --> 12:19.550
I enjoy morethan the musical
stylings of ms.Liza minnelli.

12:22.750 --> 12:25.270
Straight to voice mail.Okay.

12:25.410 --> 12:29.100
So I see you're ignoringmy calls
now.That's interesting.we need to talk.

12:29.230 --> 12:33.370
My account's been depleted by someone who
had accessto all my personal information.

12:33.480 --> 12:37.010
So,uh,any ideaswho that would
be?Call me back,right now.

12:37.150 --> 12:40.100
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:40.580 --> 12:41.500
How's work going?

12:41.630 --> 12:43.630
Work is good.Thanks.

12:43.740 --> 12:46.330
Did we get those suppliesdivya ordered?

12:46.460 --> 12:50.140
-Yeah,they're right there.
-Okay.

12:50.280 --> 12:54.420
How much do they c  
what are they for again?

12:54.550 --> 12:58.030
I got to gocheck for mold at the
houseof a hallucinating woman.

12:58.140 --> 13:01.800
Oh,wow,that sounds dangerous.Should
we be charging hera premium for that,or

13:01.910 --> 13:03.380
what?No.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.710
But I should startgetting paid extra
to deal with overbearing siblings.

13:06.820 --> 13:10.130
Mine and hers.She's
gotthis psychic sister.

13:10.230 --> 13:13.970
Really?She's psychic?Hope she didn't
put a 1 900number on the contact sheet.

13:14.100 --> 13:19.750
Actually,all she said was that
you're in some kindof trouble.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.630
That's so weird.

13:21.740 --> 13:24.160
You know what?Actually,that
mold thingsounds dangerous.

13:24.290 --> 13:27.660
I'm gonna comeand
help you out,hank,okay?

13:27.790 --> 13:29.920
Okay,here's the deal.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.640
Two weeks,max.

13:31.760 --> 13:37.150
No matter what happensas far as us,
start lookingfor your own place today.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.020
That's aggressive,but reasonable.

13:39.160 --> 13:42.020
And...you will stayin the guest room.

13:42.130 --> 13:43.730
-What if,um
-at all times.

13:43.840 --> 13:47.070
And last,but not leastof the ground
rules,get your motorcycle fixed,

13:47.190 --> 13:50.440
because this whole rideshare to
the hospitalis a one time event.

13:50.550 --> 13:52.040
I'm thinking aboutgetting a car.

13:52.170 --> 13:53.440
Sounds like progress.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.290
I'm thinking aboutpicking up one
of these intelligent parking assist.

13:56.410 --> 13:58.250
Yeah,practicallyparks itself.

13:58.390 --> 14:00.680
Well,that doessound like progress.

14:00.810 --> 14:05.080
'Cause you parallel parkingthat green saab  
that was always a bitof an extreme sport for you.

14:05.230 --> 14:08.690
Yeah,well,sadly for you,
charlie,I've moved on.

14:08.800 --> 14:19.050
I think you have a habitof moving on
to new things,a bit too quickly,jill.

14:19.050 --> 14:23.520
Well,any  any information you give me
could be,you know,like,extremely helpful.

14:23.650 --> 14:26.310
I'm not a magic 8 ball.

14:26.460 --> 14:31.100
Well,when it told youthat I was in
trouble,did it sound,like,deeply alarmed,

14:31.210 --> 14:32.680
or was it just,like,merely concerned?

14:32.800 --> 14:33.850
You know all I know.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.600
But I would be
carefulgoing into the house.

14:37.760 --> 14:42.670
I'm not surehow it will respond
to your troubled aura right now.

14:42.790 --> 14:45.440
Amy...please... stop saying that.

14:46.300 --> 14:48.410
I mean,first of all,no one is gonna
believe that the house is haunted.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.590
What,the house is haunted?

14:49.680 --> 14:53.520
Can I talk to you
aboutthe tents over here?

14:53.990 --> 14:55.940
This is outsideour
scope of practice,hank.

14:56.060 --> 14:58.420
We're not a conciergeghostbusters
service,okay?

14:58.510 --> 15:01.730
We're going into look for mold.I'll
take the attic,you take the basement.

15:01.850 --> 15:02.910
I'm not goingto the basement.

15:03.010 --> 15:07.450
Fine,you take the
attic.Try not to get slimed.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.240
Oh,yeah,I should havetaken the basement.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.080
Jesus!

15:17.560 --> 15:22.950
Moldy,moldy,moldy,mold.Where are you?

15:23.070 --> 15:25.750
God,why would ichoose the attic?

15:25.870 --> 15:31.220
Hello?Satan?

15:31.350 --> 15:38.000
I bet the basementis finished...
with,like,a pool table.

15:38.190 --> 15:42.850
You sent me up hereto look for mo...

15:48.880 --> 15:51.440
yo,I thinkI found the mold.

15:55.020 --> 15:59.200
henry... does the mold make you
starthallucinating immediately?

15:59.320 --> 16:01.260
Okay,hank,get up hereright now.

16:01.340 --> 16:03.360
Because I don't think it's
mold,I think it's ghosts.

16:03.510 --> 16:07.360
And...now the ghostsare
morphing into bats!

16:07.490 --> 16:10.780
Hank!

16:22.940 --> 16:30.520
-Here is your iced tea,evan.
-Thank you so much.I'm really thirsty.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.440
So that's a long islandiced tea.

16:33.570 --> 16:37.060
House specialty.I make them
every dayfor family cocktail hour.

16:37.170 --> 16:37.880
Really?

16:37.970 --> 16:40.350
Apparently,spiritscalm the spirits.

16:40.460 --> 16:41.940
That's  that'san interesting saying.

16:43.110 --> 16:49.320
amy,do you thinkthat the bats
were the dark auraaround me?

16:49.500 --> 16:53.050
-No,I don'T .
-Really?

16:58.690 --> 17:00.890
Tell me something,amy.

17:01.600 --> 17:06.760
are you still seeingthe
dark aura around me?

17:06.940 --> 17:09.790
-Hey,is thatwhat I think it is?
-Dead bat.

17:09.910 --> 17:11.760
Oh,my god!You could
have justsaid yes,dude.

17:11.829 --> 17:14.829
Zoey,batscan carry rabies,
which can causehallucinations.

17:14.930 --> 17:15.890
What?

17:15.950 --> 17:19.140
Just relax.Have you
spent timein that attic?

17:19.220 --> 17:22.520
I've been up thereonce or twice 
 to take measurementsfor the b&B.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.890
See,zoey?The bats,the house.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.180
Everyone thinks the b&bis a bad idea.

17:27.290 --> 17:31.200
Sadly,the house and the
batsdon't get a vote.

17:31.310 --> 17:34.090
Well,I'llgo tell them that.

17:35.580 --> 17:43.660
My only recent biteshave been mosquito bites,
especially since amy started making ussleep outside.

17:43.790 --> 17:47.110
Well,believe it or not,bat bites
and mosquito bites look a lot alike.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.860
They're actually really
toughto differentiate.

17:48.990 --> 17:52.570
Oh,my god.I know I got
bit.I got bit somewhere.

17:52.670 --> 17:54.220
Any other theories?

17:54.340 --> 17:59.530
Well,a certain funguscan grow on bat guano and
causea respiratory infection called histoplasmosis.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.490
The symptoms don't
typicallyinclude hallucinations,

18:02.610 --> 18:07.110
but coughingis a hallmark sign,along
with chills,fever,and headaches.

18:07.230 --> 18:09.010
I've had this coughfor
a couple weeks now.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.520
Yeah,you saidit comes and goes.

18:10.610 --> 18:11.800
Comes by day,goes by night.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.070
Do you take anythingfor it?

18:13.190 --> 18:18.890
No,I had a bad reactionto antibiotics when I
was younger,so medication kind offreaks me out.

18:18.990 --> 18:22.240
Well,while the labtests the bat,I'd like to
do a skin testto check for the histoplasmosis,

18:22.240 --> 18:26.900
allergies,and anything else that
might tell uswhat's going on here.

18:27.020 --> 18:29.710
-Okay.
-Okay.

18:30.220 --> 18:31.490
Hank...

18:32.820 --> 18:37.160
Remember when I saidI was
too afraid to go see a doctor?

18:37.290 --> 18:44.050
If I'd known there wasa doctor out there
like you,I might have foundthe courage.

18:46.210 --> 18:48.370
Dude,look at this.Is that a
bat biteor a mosquito bite?

18:48.500 --> 18:49.670
You know,I can't really say.

18:49.800 --> 18:50.980
They're exactly the same?

18:52.460 --> 18:54.110
If I got bit by a bat,what's
gonna happen to me?

18:54.250 --> 18:56.760
All right,worst casescenario,you die.

18:56.870 --> 18:59.960
Best case scenario,you become immortal.

19:00.080 --> 19:00.890
What?

19:01.010 --> 19:04.440
Put your shirt on.

19:13.470 --> 19:18.060
tough to findan appropriate card
for strategic indian engagement.

19:18.210 --> 19:22.660
Yeah,you have no ideahow long it
took me to narrow it downto these two.

19:22.810 --> 19:25.340
There's more cardsover there.

19:25.470 --> 19:27.190
So will I see youat hill manor?

19:27.310 --> 19:28.260
I guess so.

19:28.370 --> 19:29.970
By the way,do you knowthe hill sisters?

19:30.080 --> 19:31.370
I grew up with them.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.800
What were they like?

19:32.910 --> 19:38.380
Well,uh,zoey was
sweetand pretty.Outgoing.

19:38.530 --> 19:41.360
And she knew everyoneand
always got the guy.

19:41.510 --> 19:43.160
And amy?

19:43.310 --> 19:48.200
Mm...amy wore black and foundedthe
high school's wicca club.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.260
Pretty quirky chick.

19:50.370 --> 19:57.180
But,you know,in her own special way,she always
looked outfor her sister and I respected that.

19:57.300 --> 20:00.870
I imagine you would too.

20:01.080 --> 20:05.360
So speaking ofold acquaintances...
I guess I owe youan explanation.

20:05.450 --> 20:08.590
Oh,look,to be honest,jill,I
really don't wantto hear about it.

20:08.660 --> 20:09.620
About him.

20:09.720 --> 20:15.490
If he's here to staythis time,if it
worksfor you and him,I'm happy for you.

20:15.610 --> 20:18.980
And if it doesn't,you
know where to find me.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.260
As long as you get that I can't
put my life on holdin the meantime.

20:22.370 --> 20:24.300
And I wouldn't ask you to.

20:24.420 --> 20:28.870
I just need to figure outwhat's right for
me,and I can't rusha decision like that.

20:28.980 --> 20:30.940
No,I get it.

20:31.050 --> 20:33.330
Let's see what you got.

20:38.890 --> 20:40.100
Why this one?

20:40.200 --> 20:44.640
It's just more...you.

20:44.780 --> 20:47.470
I agree.

20:53.050 --> 20:59.490
When you first thoughtthat place might
not work,what was it that youwere thinking?

20:59.620 --> 21:01.330
Truthfully?

21:01.440 --> 21:04.290
I was thinking divine intervention.

21:04.440 --> 21:09.580
Spiritual intervention.Whatever.I
thought it was an out.

21:09.700 --> 21:11.450
There are no more outs.

21:11.570 --> 21:14.640
We tried to delay this
again,and they moved it up.

21:14.770 --> 21:16.020
We're almost there.

21:16.120 --> 21:18.490
We may as well justget it over with.

21:18.630 --> 21:21.820
Well,you soundso terribly
excited about this marriage.

21:21.900 --> 21:24.850
I know many coupleswho
got married deeply in love.

21:24.970 --> 21:26.600
Now,they barely speak.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.630
You have been my best
friendfor 20 years.

21:29.730 --> 21:33.730
We trust and respecteach
other.We never fight.

21:33.860 --> 21:37.540
Maybe we'll grow into love,
instead of fallingin and out of it.

21:37.650 --> 21:40.470
But does it feel rightto you?

21:40.580 --> 21:49.230
Divya... we have to stopbeing
emotional about logical decisions.

21:51.750 --> 21:52.960
Is zoey's lab reportback yet?

21:53.110 --> 21:53.980
No.

21:54.140 --> 21:56.990
But her scratch testwas
positive for histoplasmosis.

21:57.090 --> 22:00.430
Which explainsthe coughing by
day,but not the hallucinatingby night.

22:00.550 --> 22:02.830
And I just don't thinkthis is psychosis.

22:02.950 --> 22:05.000
Which leads us tothe
possibility of encephalitis.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.610
We got to get this thingsolved
quickly,so you can get engaged.

22:07.720 --> 22:10.010
Well,let's not be too
hastywith patient care.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.730
So we...

22:13.600 --> 22:18.660
divya,we know you and raj are gonna
havesome big decisions to make.

22:18.780 --> 22:21.450
Just know that evan
and iare here to stay.

22:21.580 --> 22:25.400
And there's always,always a place for
you here with hankmed,no matter what.

22:25.490 --> 22:27.300
Well,I appreciate that.

22:27.430 --> 22:32.220
And I'll let you knowwhat my future holds...
as soon as my parentsdecide it for me.

22:32.220 --> 22:35.330
Well,maybenegotiations'll
still fall apartlast minute.

22:35.330 --> 22:37.460
Maybe your dad'llraise
the dowry to five goats

22:37.460 --> 22:39.700
and a donkey and raj'll
call ita deal breaker!

22:39.900 --> 22:41.240
Hmm,maybeyou're the donkey.

22:43.420 --> 22:47.170
Hankmed,how can   okay,slow down.

22:47.300 --> 22:50.120
It's amy hill,and she's freaking out.

22:52.300 --> 22:55.630
We're on our way.

22:55.780 --> 22:57.270
Ah,I tried

22:57.400 --> 23:00.680
I tried to get up there,but
the attic doorlocked behind her.

23:00.790 --> 23:02.300
All right,I'm gonna finda
way to get on that roof.

23:02.500 --> 23:05.870
Evan,you tryto find a
ladder.Divya,keep amy back.

23:06.740 --> 23:09.510
Zoey,please!Just stay where you are.

23:09.570 --> 23:12.310
Don't worry.Hank'll take care of this.

23:13.320 --> 23:16.540
Zoey  zoey,zoey,don't move.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.410
Look,nothingyou're seeing is real.

23:22.540 --> 23:25.280
And you could hurt yourselfreally
badly if you take another step.

23:25.330 --> 23:27.650
Do you understand me?

23:28.540 --> 23:31.540
Zoey,zoey.

23:39.710 --> 23:43.350
Zoey,are you okay?

23:43.930 --> 23:45.640
Where's hank? There you are.

23:45.820 --> 23:49.150
Here,divya,I got it.

23:49.370 --> 23:51.750
Here,let's get her downover here.

23:58.190 --> 24:00.660
Zoey,what were you doing?

24:00.770 --> 24:04.590
Amy.Your ears are really big.

24:04.720 --> 24:05.830
Whoa,is she okay?

24:05.940 --> 24:08.990
As far as the
fall,yeah.Yeah,she'll be fine.

24:09.120 --> 24:10.580
You want to dothe spinal tap tonight?

24:10.690 --> 24:11.900
And that's not allI want to do.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.360
There may be only one way to get
to the bottom of thisimmediately.

24:14.480 --> 24:15.600
-Mri?
-Exorcism?

24:15.710 --> 24:18.970
Her hallucinationsonly manifest at
night,so we're gonna worka graveyard shift.

24:19.100 --> 24:20.660
A sleepover?

24:20.780 --> 24:23.660
I'm a huge fanof that procedure.

24:26.490 --> 24:28.530
-Okay,lidocaine.
-Prepped.

24:28.630 --> 24:32.530
Wow,you're doinga spinal tap in the very placeyou'll
be getting engaged in the next couple days.

24:32.640 --> 24:33.990
That's got to be nine
differentkinds of bad luck.

24:34.090 --> 24:36.120
Shut up,evan.

24:40.860 --> 24:41.810
What is this for?

24:41.970 --> 24:46.370
Spinal needle.It'll help useither
diagnose or rule outthe encephalitis.

24:46.510 --> 24:47.620
Elephantitis?

24:47.750 --> 24:51.080
No,I don't seeany elephants.

24:51.210 --> 24:55.250
All I see is that reallybig knife.

24:55.370 --> 24:58.480
How's that even gonnafit in me?

24:58.750 --> 25:00.950
She just

25:02.220 --> 25:04.400
okay,here we go.

25:08.890 --> 25:12.020
You're doing great.

25:18.810 --> 25:22.000
Well,this is a new onefor hankmed.

25:22.150 --> 25:25.910
Why don't you just summon
the apparitions?

25:26.020 --> 25:27.330
Okay,why are youasking me?

25:27.430 --> 25:29.930
'Cause you're indian.Maybe some
of the rituals translate,right?

25:31.370 --> 25:36.450
Wait a second.You think that hinduismand
wicca have overlapping ideologies?

25:36.570 --> 25:38.430
I'm just thinkingoutside the box.

25:38.550 --> 25:41.870
You're a bloodyneanderthal.Honestly,you'rea
bloody neanderthal.

25:41.980 --> 25:44.350
What,every time I just

25:46.160 --> 25:49.640
Amy... everything okay?

25:49.780 --> 25:50.750
No,it's not.

25:50.880 --> 25:54.350
I need to get hersomething to drink,but
we've run outof supplies out here.

25:54.440 --> 25:56.590
I'd have to go...inside.

25:56.680 --> 26:00.350
If evan needed me to go in that house,I wouldn't
care if it was infested with mountain lions,

26:00.460 --> 26:04.380
I'd go in,but... you
know,that's just me.

26:07.740 --> 26:10.130
No,it's not just you.

26:10.250 --> 26:16.880
If zoey asks for me,tell
her I'll be right out.

26:17.120 --> 26:19.380
Wa  wait.You're gonna go in the house?

26:19.480 --> 26:20.680
I thou  what aboutthe cleansing?

26:20.770 --> 26:28.520
I guess I'll justhave to start a new
one... after I fix usa round of iced teas.

26:31.780 --> 26:35.620
Zoey. When do you usually
haveyour daily cocktail?

26:35.730 --> 26:37.500
Every night before bed.

26:37.620 --> 26:40.610
That's what helpsstop
the coughing,silly.

26:40.730 --> 26:42.320
Okay,I'll be backin a minute.

26:42.440 --> 26:45.790
Guys,keep an eye on herfor me,please.

26:53.660 --> 26:57.400
What the hell have
youbeen giving your sister?

26:57.540 --> 26:58.820
It's just cough syrup.

26:58.930 --> 27:01.750
She's beenup all night,so...
I'm giving hera second dose.

27:01.830 --> 27:04.500
Does she know you've been putting
that in her drinkthis whole time?

27:04.600 --> 27:08.850
If she did,she wouldn't drink
it,because she refusesto take medication.

27:08.970 --> 27:11.810
I just couldn't stand listening
to her sufferevery night.

27:11.900 --> 27:15.930
This brand of cough syrup has an
extremely high percentage of dextromethorphan.

27:16.050 --> 27:16.920
Why does that matter?

27:17.020 --> 27:20.620
High volume,highconcentration
doses of dxm are a bad idea.

27:21.260 --> 27:25.570
and for some people with a genetic
inabilityto metabolize it it's a toxic idea.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.150
You give her this,and within
15 minutes,she stops coughing,

27:28.150 --> 27:34.660
but two hours later,when its action
peaks,she starts jumpingthrough windows.

27:34.820 --> 27:38.240
I had no clue.

27:38.470 --> 27:40.870
I thoughtI was helping her.

27:43.460 --> 27:46.770
Do you have any idea what it's like to

27:46.900 --> 27:52.250
begiven way more responsibility
than you ever...asked for?

27:52.370 --> 27:55.320
Way more than youever deserved?

27:55.490 --> 27:59.070
When I was 12,my mom got sick.

27:59.200 --> 28:04.320
My dad,who lost all our moneyin the stock
market,couldn't affordto take care of her.

28:04.410 --> 28:12.770
So he gave up. On her,on us,and
he left.And then our mom died.

28:12.890 --> 28:16.540
I know exactlywhat it's like.

28:16.660 --> 28:21.600
Being the older siblingone day and
then feeling likea parent the next.

28:21.700 --> 28:26.770
You do anything you canto protect
the only thing you have left.

28:33.180 --> 28:36.940
So inanimate objects would
grow,shrink,and bend.

28:37.020 --> 28:39.450
Distanceand depth perception
would be skewed as well.

28:39.550 --> 28:42.000
For instance,if you werestanding
on the roof,looking down,

28:42.110 --> 28:45.630
jumping into the moatmight look like
nothing more than stepping into a puddle.

28:45.750 --> 28:46.800
What's wrong with me,hank?

28:46.870 --> 28:51.190
It's a disorientingneurological condition
calledalice in wonderland syndrome.

28:51.310 --> 28:53.940
But once you stoptaking the
cough syrup and the dxm in it,

28:54.080 --> 28:56.930
you will be back in the
realworld with the rest of us.

28:57.060 --> 28:58.440
What about her cough?

28:58.560 --> 29:01.180
We'll administer an
antifungalcalled itraconazole.

29:01.330 --> 29:05.420
It will treatthe histoplasmosis
and clear up the coughas well.

29:05.540 --> 29:07.710
Safely.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.470
I am so sorry,zo.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.150
No,it's  it's okay.

29:13.270 --> 29:15.870
At least we verifiedthat medicine
and i still don't get along.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.950
Don't blame the medicine.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.460
Blame me.

29:19.590 --> 29:24.660
I'm the onewho made you spend
two weeks in...wonderland.

29:24.780 --> 29:27.280
You broke a cleanse for me.

29:27.400 --> 29:30.460
I know how seriouslyyou take those.

29:30.590 --> 29:33.650
Some thingsI take more seriously.

29:46.930 --> 29:52.090
Oh,g   hank!It's  it's happening!

29:52.090 --> 29:53.260
So do you think I'm
gonnaturn into like a

29:53.380 --> 29:54.890
an old school,bela lugosi type,

29:55.040 --> 29:57.510
or maybe like a hip,sexy,twilight
vampire with,like,the

29:57.640 --> 30:00.370
And,like,the cool hair,or what?

30:00.500 --> 30:02.710
I  I can't see anything.

30:02.820 --> 30:05.160
What do you call
those,enrique?Look at the red lines.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.280
I can alreadyfeel my skin burning
from the sunlightpouring in.

30:07.410 --> 30:08.450
There's nothingon your arm.

30:08.570 --> 30:09.500
Why do you keep saying that?

30:09.620 --> 30:14.560
Look... okay,what the
hellis happening to me?

30:14.690 --> 30:16.810
Your mind is playing trickson you.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.990
I'm hallucinating like  like zoey?

30:19.130 --> 30:21.160
Well,with her,her bodywas
affecting her mind.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.140
With you,it's the opposite.

30:23.280 --> 30:26.770
And you have been actingeven
weirder than usual.

30:28.780 --> 30:31.270
Why are youso worked up,evan?

30:33.450 --> 30:35.510
Come on,whatever it is,you can tell me.

30:35.510 --> 30:39.520
You know what?It's,uh... it's
nothingyou have to worry about.

30:39.610 --> 30:43.040
But thank you for...being there.

30:43.170 --> 30:45.410
You know,you always are.

30:45.490 --> 30:48.990
It's got to be exhaustinghaving to...
bail me out of troubleover and over again.

30:49.100 --> 30:50.780
Yeah,well,I didn'thave
much of a choice this time.

30:50.900 --> 30:54.220
You ran into my roomand
jumped into my bed.

31:04.390 --> 31:06.020
It's beautiful.

31:21.320 --> 31:24.450
So,uh...congratulations?

31:24.590 --> 31:26.880
Yeah,we're so...ambivalent for you.

31:27.120 --> 31:32.050
If you think that thisis uncomfortable,wait
till you seewhat happens in 15 minutes.

31:32.200 --> 31:35.860
When I stand upand piss off a tent
full of bandyopadhyaysand katdares.

31:35.990 --> 31:38.800
Oh,my god,are you pregnant?

31:38.920 --> 31:40.350
No,I'm not pregnant.

31:40.430 --> 31:41.190
Are you gay?

31:41.290 --> 31:42.150
Evan,really?

31:42.250 --> 31:44.280
Divya... what are you talking about?

31:44.410 --> 31:46.200
I've thought aboutwhat
you both said to me.

31:46.350 --> 31:47.270
And you're right.

31:47.380 --> 31:48.950
I can't do this.

31:49.070 --> 31:51.000
I won't do this.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.840
And I'm gonna tell thatto all of them.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.090
How did raj take this?

31:55.230 --> 31:58.580
He doesn't know yet.He would
just tryto talk me out of it.

31:58.720 --> 32:02.250
And even if he didn't,I don't want
him to appearcomplicit in this.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.600
I'm going to do thisall on my own.

32:04.740 --> 32:06.020
Divya.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.950
Anyway,I'm so gladthat you both came.

32:09.080 --> 32:13.440
'Cause I may need you tostand
by with a getaway vehicle.

32:14.050 --> 32:15.020
I'm way ahead of you.

32:15.130 --> 32:18.820
I record the whole thingon my phone camera and
we sell it to bollywoodas a reality show,right?

32:18.950 --> 32:21.080
You read my mind.

32:21.230 --> 32:25.670
Speaking of,here comes patricia
arquette and alice herself.

32:26.290 --> 32:28.070
Hey,how are you feeling,zoey?

32:28.190 --> 32:30.680
Cough gone,hallucinations gone.

32:30.820 --> 32:33.450
Know what's weird?I almost
missmy little wonderland.

32:33.590 --> 32:36.520
It's like somebody rippedthe
3 d glasses right off my face.

32:36.680 --> 32:39.290
Nah,I'll take youto an imax
movie sometime.Way safer.

32:39.430 --> 32:42.140
I got to say,it's really nice to see
you guysup and running again  wow.

32:42.270 --> 32:44.910
Actually,this is ourlast
event for a while.

32:45.030 --> 32:46.160
Really?Why?

32:46.300 --> 32:50.880
To renovatefor our expansion
into a bed and breakfast.

32:51.010 --> 32:52.290
How'd shechange your mind?

32:52.420 --> 32:54.100
Actually,you guys did it.

32:54.220 --> 32:57.750
You staying herethe other night made
me realizehow rewarding it could be...

32:57.880 --> 32:59.290
to have overnight guests.

32:59.290 --> 33:02.790
Well,sleepoversand epiphanies.Just
two more serviceswe provide at hankmed.

33:02.910 --> 33:03.470
Zip it.

33:03.580 --> 33:09.820
But,for the record,doctor,we'll never know if
youcleaned house here the other night,or I did.

33:09.930 --> 33:14.080
Well,scienceand spirituality
can share the crediton this one.

33:14.080 --> 33:18.750
Uh,looks likewe need
more chairs.Excuse me.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.590
Have you seenthat lily pond up close?

33:20.720 --> 33:22.250
You sure it's not justa little puddle?

33:22.370 --> 33:25.460
Oh,well,why don'twe go find out?

33:26.120 --> 33:30.340
What do you mean,"it's done and done"?

33:30.470 --> 33:31.960
Well,no,this is what I'm saying.

33:32.070 --> 33:37.960
There is no more time.We
need that money back now.

33:38.080 --> 33:42.700
I can't believeyou're
doing this to me.Again.

33:42.780 --> 33:45.860
Hello?

33:46.210 --> 33:48.310
Hey,evan.

33:48.430 --> 33:49.740
Do you know where hank is?

33:49.870 --> 33:53.150
Yeah,he is right... he was right there.

33:53.280 --> 33:55.320
This place is spooky.

33:55.470 --> 33:57.780
Yeah,there's somethingimportant
I need to tell him.

33:57.930 --> 33:59.350
Yeah,you and me both.

33:59.490 --> 34:01.270
Um...I thinkhe's at the bar.

34:01.410 --> 34:04.910
Oh,no,wait  psychic
moment.That's where I'm headed.

34:06.790 --> 34:08.639
This is beautiful.

34:08.739 --> 34:10.360
We used to throw partiesright here,

34:10.510 --> 34:15.550
but when a drunken groomsman went skinny dippingin
the lily pond,amy didn't take itvery well.

34:15.690 --> 34:19.170
She is really protectiveof
this place,huh?

34:19.310 --> 34:20.679
And really protectiveof you.

34:20.820 --> 34:23.380
I really haven't noticed.

34:23.510 --> 34:26.730
You two definitely don't
seemcut from the same cloth.

34:26.850 --> 34:30.600
Oh,well,the same thingcould
be said about you and evan.

34:30.710 --> 34:32.290
And it has been said.

34:32.380 --> 34:35.199
Yeah,life sent him one way,me another.

34:35.320 --> 34:39.889
And then it did a funny thingand brought us back
together to start this littlebusiness of ours.

34:40.040 --> 34:45.389
And somehow... we have
foundcommon ground.

34:45.780 --> 34:52.610
You know,um,I grew up hearing peoplecall
my sister crazy every single day.

34:52.760 --> 34:54.920
You never assumedI was crazy.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.450
Gave me the benefit of the doubt.

34:57.580 --> 34:58.930
Most peoplewouldn't have,hank.

34:59.110 --> 35:01.680
Yeah,well,more people should be like us.

35:01.820 --> 35:05.640
And less people should be like most people.

35:08.860 --> 35:11.570
so... about that movieyou suggested.

35:11.820 --> 35:16.880
Oh,not just a movie.An imax experience.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.400
But,zoey,um...you're a patient.

35:20.560 --> 35:21.860
But I'm cured now.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.160
Yeah,yeah,it looks like you are.

35:24.300 --> 35:26.250
So I'm nota patient anymore.

35:26.380 --> 35:27.880
That's true.

35:28.370 --> 35:31.000
I just gotout of a relationship.

35:31.110 --> 35:32.240
Oh,you should have ledwith that reason.

35:32.350 --> 35:34.760
Probably should have.

35:34.900 --> 35:37.820
I I just need some time,you
know,before jumpinginto something new.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.280
And I have no ideahow
much time it'll take.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.310
Maybe I could tell you.

35:41.460 --> 35:44.070
Really?And how would you do that?

35:44.200 --> 35:47.550
Amy taught mehow to read palms.

35:50.100 --> 35:53.030
Let's see here.

35:53.190 --> 35:55.740
I see a blonde.

35:55.890 --> 36:00.940
In a lavender summer dress.

36:16.090 --> 36:19.980
I am so sorry,raj.

36:22.820 --> 36:25.330
Thank you all for coming.

36:25.460 --> 36:28.990
And I,uh,I apologizefor
wasting your time.

36:29.140 --> 36:33.120
But there will beno engagement ceremony.

36:33.340 --> 36:38.610
There will be no wedding.There will
be no moreof this farce whatsoever.

36:38.750 --> 36:44.350
I could stand up hereand tell you that I
love rajwith all my heart,but the truth is...

36:44.500 --> 36:46.790
I don'T.

36:48.780 --> 36:51.710
Nor does he love me.

36:51.850 --> 36:57.770
We are just two friends,never given a
chance to loveanybody but each other.

36:58.490 --> 37:00.630
And we deserve that chance.

37:00.770 --> 37:08.720
And now... finally...
we're going to have it.

37:56.420 --> 37:58.500
What's up,brah?

37:59.150 --> 38:00.530
Did jill find you yet?

38:00.640 --> 38:02.190
No,why?What'd she say?

38:02.580 --> 38:05.370
She had somethingimportant to tell you.

38:06.700 --> 38:09.230
So do I.

38:09.390 --> 38:10.930
What's up?

38:11.710 --> 38:13.830
We're broke.

38:13.910 --> 38:15.810
What do you mean broke?

38:15.930 --> 38:18.290
I mean depleted,destitute,insolvent.

38:18.430 --> 38:21.210
I was asking for
anexplanation,not a thesaurus.

38:21.580 --> 38:23.660
What the hell are youtalking about,evan?

38:23.770 --> 38:29.750
Well,I,uh,I invested our working capital
in some alternative,high yield instruments

38:29.900 --> 38:31.990
english,evan.

38:32.180 --> 38:34.150
We got scammed.

38:34.310 --> 38:39.710
You got scammed.By who?

38:40.360 --> 38:41.620
And it's all gone,you know.

38:41.960 --> 38:46.080
Almost every last pennyof
it,at least.It's  it's gone.

38:49.870 --> 38:50.870
Why are you not furious?

38:50.970 --> 38:52.090
Oh,I'm furious.

38:52.260 --> 38:56.080
I I'm furious.I'm just not surprised.

38:56.500 --> 39:01.680
In fact,the only shock hereis that it
took this long for you to let me down.

39:01.830 --> 39:03.300
Look,I'm gonnafind a
way to get that money.

39:03.440 --> 39:05.050
Don't you get it?

39:05.180 --> 39:10.990
It's not about the money.It's about
the secrets,the lies,the greed.

39:11.130 --> 39:12.730
We can rebuild.I know we can.

39:12.860 --> 39:15.740
Yeah,hankmed,maybe.

39:15.930 --> 39:20.360
My trust in you... doubtful.

39:20.480 --> 39:25.270
Come on,that... hank.

39:42.830 --> 39:44.240
Hank!

39:45.730 --> 39:47.480
I'm  I'm guessingyou're here for jill.

39:47.610 --> 39:51.180
Would you like me to let herknow
you dropped by next time I see her?

39:51.400 --> 39:54.040
Uh,actually,I was toldshe
had a message for me.

39:54.200 --> 39:58.850
But...I guess I got the
messagepretty clearly now.

39:59.520 --> 40:02.690
Let me know if it needsany
further clarification.

40:02.830 --> 40:05.550
Maybe I can help you outwith that.

40:25.690 --> 40:26.900
Who was at the door?

40:27.030 --> 40:28.410
Oh,it was just some guy.
