02:02.705 --> 02:05.156
ALTHOUGH I WISH HE WOULD
EASE UP ON THE COLOGNE A LITTLE.

02:05.224 --> 02:06.941
YEAH, IT IS
KIND OF STRONG.

02:07.009 --> 02:08.726
KIND OF?
YOU KNOW, THE OTHER DAY

02:08.794 --> 02:11.062
I SAW A FLY
LAND ON HIS SHOULDER,

02:11.130 --> 02:14.099
2 SECONDS LATER... DEAD.

02:14.934 --> 02:16.418
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS

THE NUCLEUS.

02:39.341 --> 02:40.942
WHAT?

02:41.009 --> 02:43.978
EVERY PILE OF NACHOS
HAS ONE MAIN CHIP

02:44.046 --> 02:46.097
THAT HOLDS THE WHOLE THING
TOGETHER-THE NUCLEUS.

02:46.165 --> 02:48.566
YOU DON'T TAKE THE NUCLEUS.
YOU WORK AROUND IT.

02:48.634 --> 02:50.601
YOU HONOR IT.

02:50.669 --> 02:52.937
THAT'S NACHOS 101,
MAN.

02:53.005 --> 02:56.208

THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

03:21.049 --> 03:21.733
LET'S DO IT.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.951
REALLY? THANK YOU.

03:23.018 --> 03:24.953

03:25.020 --> 03:26.454

ULTIMATE FIGHTING THING.

03:26.521 --> 03:27.989
YOU NEED 4 PEOPLE
TO GET A BOOTH.

03:28.057 --> 03:29.824
I GOT A CHANCE TO HANG OUT

03:29.891 --> 03:33.261
AND HER NEW WORK FRIENDS,

03:33.329 --> 03:35.330

LOOKIN' FORWARD TO IT.

03:39.301 --> 03:40.468
YOU DO REALIZE

03:40.536 --> 03:42.804
YOU JUST WENT FROM 2
PSYCHOS FIGHTING IN A CAGE

03:42.871 --> 03:46.106
TO A GUY IN A BOW TIE
SINGING ABOUT INFLATION.

03:46.174 --> 03:48.043
HA HA! I FORGOT
ABOUT THAT ONE.

03:48.110 --> 03:50.945
THAT ONE'S GREAT.
HA HA HA!

03:51.013 --> 03:52.713

03:57.019 --> 03:59.220
LOOK, CARRIE JUST GOT
A NEW JOB, AND THAT'S GREAT.

03:59.287 --> 04:01.088
THE BAD NEWS IS, NOW
THERE'S A WHOLE NEW BUILDING

04:01.156 --> 04:02.924
FULL OF THESE MANHATTAN
CHUCKLEHEADS

04:02.992 --> 04:04.592
SHE'S GONNA
WANT TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH.

04:04.660 --> 04:06.177
OH, SHE LOVES THAT.

04:06.244 --> 04:08.563
"OH, LET'S MAKE NEW FRIENDS.
LET'S OPEN UP OUR WORLD."

04:08.631 --> 04:10.765
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T
WANT TO OPEN UP OUR WORLD.

04:10.832 --> 04:13.268
I WANT TO CLOSE OUR WORLD.

04:13.335 --> 04:15.836
BUILD A DOME OVER IT.

04:15.904 --> 04:17.672
WELL, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO MEET ANY NEW PEOPLE,

04:17.740 --> 04:19.507
WHY'D YOU AGREE
TO GO OUT WITH THEM?

04:19.575 --> 04:21.676
BECAUSE CARRIE
CAN'T KNOW ABOUT THE DOME.

04:21.744 --> 04:23.444
SO WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS...

04:23.512 --> 04:26.080
HAPPILY AGREE TO GO OUT
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

04:26.148 --> 04:29.450
AND THEN LET'S JUST SAY,

04:35.357 --> 04:37.625
OH, THANKS FOR TAKING US
TONIGHT, YOU GUYS.

04:37.693 --> 04:38.793
OH, SURE.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.895
MARK RUSSELL
NEVER DISAPPOINTS.

04:40.963 --> 04:44.232
I HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE SO MANY
WORDS THAT RHYME WITH BIPARTISAN.

04:45.184 --> 04:47.669
WOW, I REALLY
LOVE THIS HOUSE.

04:47.737 --> 04:49.871
OH, THANK YOU.
IT'S JUST A PLACE HOLDER

04:49.938 --> 04:51.472
UNTIL I HIT THE LOTTERY.

04:51.540 --> 04:53.474
ACTUALLY... I THINK
I'M A PLACE HOLDER

04:53.542 --> 04:55.042
UNTIL SHE HITS
THE LOTTERY.

04:55.110 --> 04:57.061
HONEY, YOU WANT TO
GET SOME COFFEE GOING?

04:57.129 --> 04:58.479
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

04:58.547 --> 05:00.381

05:03.818 --> 05:04.752
YEAH.

05:06.988 --> 05:09.090

ASK YOU GUYS A QUESTION?

05:09.158 --> 05:10.425
OH, SURE.

05:10.492 --> 05:13.394
IS THIS A LOT OF HAIR,
RIGHT HERE? SERIOUSLY.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.116
'CAUSE SOME PEOPLE
SAY I'M HAIRY,

05:18.183 --> 05:20.968
BUT I DON'T THINK
I'M HAIRY ENOUGH, YOU KNOW?

05:21.036 --> 05:23.137
LIKE, ESPECIALLY IN THE
WINTER, THE COLD MONTHS.

05:23.205 --> 05:24.405
YEAH, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:24.473 --> 05:26.340
I, UH, I DON'T, UM...

05:26.408 --> 05:28.175
I'M SURE YOU'RE FINE.

05:28.243 --> 05:29.611
YOU WANT TO TOUCH IT?
IT'S VERY SOFT.

05:29.678 --> 05:30.612
NO.

05:30.679 --> 05:32.113
GO AHEAD. SERIOUSLY.
TOUCH IT.

05:32.180 --> 05:33.448
IT'S LIKE A PUPPY,
I SWEAR.

05:33.515 --> 05:34.782
IT'S A LITTLE PUPPY.

05:34.850 --> 05:36.618
YEAH. NO BITEY, NO BITEY.

05:36.685 --> 05:38.953
UH... I DON'T THINK
I WANT TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW.

05:39.020 --> 05:41.956
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I THINK
ABOUT SHAVING IT ALL OFF

05:42.023 --> 05:44.925
AND JUST STUFFIN' IT IN A
PILLOWCASE AND SLEEPIN' ON IT.

05:44.993 --> 05:47.345
HEY.
THERE SHE IS.

05:47.412 --> 05:49.263
I HOPE YOU GUYS
DON'T MIND.

05:49.331 --> 05:51.315
ALL I COULD FIND
WERE THESE OREOS.

05:51.383 --> 05:53.301
YEAH. UM, ACTUALLY,
WE HAVE TO SCOOT.

05:53.368 --> 05:54.469
YEAH.

05:54.536 --> 05:55.636
COME ON, HANG OUT.

05:55.704 --> 05:57.305
YEAH, I'M SORRY.

05:57.373 --> 05:59.724
I FORGOT THE BABYSITTER
NEEDS US HOME BY 11:00.

05:59.791 --> 06:00.992
BY 11:00.
SHE DID SAY THAT.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.760
OH, OK.
ALL RIGHT.

06:02.828 --> 06:04.862
WELL, LET'S DO THIS
AGAIN, YOU GUYS.

06:04.930 --> 06:06.614
YEAH,
WE'LL CHECK OUR SCHEDULE!

06:10.118 --> 06:11.786
THAT WAS FUN.

06:11.854 --> 06:13.921
<i>THAT WAS FUN.</i>

06:27.018 --> 06:29.954
OK, I WIN AGAIN.
YOU JUST SCRATCHED.

06:30.021 --> 06:31.656
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT
FAMILIAR WITH THE RULES

06:31.724 --> 06:34.058
OF NORTH EUROPEAN BILLIARDS.

06:34.126 --> 06:36.744
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU BROUGHT ARTHUR HERE.

06:36.812 --> 06:38.996
WE NEEDED A FOURTH TO GET THE
BOOTH. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

06:39.064 --> 06:40.731
THE BIG DEAL IS,
WHEN HE GETS INTO A FIGHT,

06:40.799 --> 06:42.800
I'M THE ONE WHO'S GONNA
HAVE TO STOP IT,

06:42.868 --> 06:45.402
<i>AND THIS IS TOO DAMN PRETTY.</i>

06:45.470 --> 06:46.737
WHO WAS LIGHT BEER?

06:46.805 --> 06:48.839
OH, THAT'D BE ME.

06:48.907 --> 06:50.158
WATCHING THE OLD WAISTLINE.

06:50.226 --> 06:52.693
GOTTA FIT INTO MY BIKINI
FOR THE SUMMER, RIGHT?

06:52.761 --> 06:55.079
RIGHT. AND 2 HEINEKENS.

06:56.615 --> 06:58.249
DAMN, THAT WAS ROUGH.

06:59.985 --> 07:02.102
YEAH, GUY. A LITTLE TIP WHEN
YOU TRY TO PICK UP CHICKS-

07:02.170 --> 07:04.605
DON'T MAKE THEM
PICTURE YOU IN A BIKINI.

07:05.407 --> 07:07.191
CAN I BORROW SOME CASH?

07:07.258 --> 07:09.410
NO MORE MONEY, ARTHUR. YOU
STINK AT POOL. DEAL WITH IT.

07:09.478 --> 07:11.796
I'LL PLAY YOU RIGHT NOW
FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.

07:11.863 --> 07:14.582
YOU ALREADY OWE ME 8 MILLION
FROM PINBALL. SIT DOWN.

07:21.690 --> 07:23.123
I'M HOT.

07:23.191 --> 07:25.125
THEN TAKE OFF
YOUR SWEATER.

07:25.193 --> 07:27.795
OH, YOU'D LIKE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

07:29.531 --> 07:30.865
FINE, THEN BE HOT.

07:31.917 --> 07:34.602
OK, YOU WIN.
ENJOY THE SHOW.

07:41.810 --> 07:43.477
DO YOU WANT SOME HELP
WITH THAT, ARTHUR?

07:43.545 --> 07:47.381
I THINK I CAN TAKE OFF
MY OWN SWEATER, THANK YOU.

07:51.386 --> 07:54.055
IS SOMEONE GONNA
HELP ME OR WHAT?

07:54.823 --> 07:56.707
COME HERE.
COME HERE.

07:58.476 --> 08:00.177
GIVE ME THAT,

08:00.245 --> 08:02.146
AND... THERE.

08:02.213 --> 08:04.431
THAT WAS TERRIFYING.

08:04.499 --> 08:06.968
I'M GONNA NEED
A MEN'S ROOM PRONTO.

08:08.953 --> 08:10.754
HERE ARE YOUR WINGS.

08:10.822 --> 08:11.755

08:15.761 --> 08:17.445
OH. YOU KNOW,
SO MANY PEOPLE

08:17.512 --> 08:18.947
TAKE THE ELDERLY

08:19.014 --> 08:21.316
IT'S REALLY SWEET SEEING YOU
TAKE CARE OF HIM LIKE THAT.

08:21.383 --> 08:23.183
IT IS?

08:23.251 --> 08:24.835
SURE. IT SHOWS
YOU HAVE A BIG HEART.

08:24.903 --> 08:26.470
I LIKE THAT.

08:26.538 --> 08:27.872
OH, HO.

08:27.939 --> 08:28.873
SHE LIKES THAT.

08:28.940 --> 08:29.958
HUH!

08:30.025 --> 08:31.292
OK, FALSE ALARM.

08:31.359 --> 08:32.794
OH, HEY,
THERE'S THE MAN.

08:32.861 --> 08:34.361
HUH?
COME HERE.

08:34.429 --> 08:37.131
<i>YOU GOT A LITTLE,
UH, SHMUTZ ON YOUR FACE.</i>

08:43.471 --> 08:45.573
OH, YOU'RE SICK, EMILY?

08:45.640 --> 08:47.825
THAT'S TOO BAD.

08:47.892 --> 08:50.728
HEY, MAYBE IT'S FROM SMELLING MR.
DUCHET'S COLOGNE, RIGHT? HA HA!

08:50.795 --> 08:52.463
OH, OK, YOU GOTTA GO?

08:52.531 --> 08:54.899
ALL RIGHT. OK. BYE-BYE.

08:54.966 --> 08:56.334
CRAP.

08:56.402 --> 08:58.119
WHAT'S THE MATTER, BABE?

08:58.187 --> 09:00.204
EMILY AND PETER
BLEW US OFF AGAIN TONIGHT.

09:00.272 --> 09:02.757
REALLY? THAT'S WEIRD.

09:03.959 --> 09:05.860
THEY SAID THEY HAD TO
GO BIRD SHOPPING.

09:05.928 --> 09:09.129
WHO GOES BIRD SHOPPING
ON A SATURDAY NIGHT?

09:09.197 --> 09:11.566
WHO GOES BIRD SHOPPING?

09:11.633 --> 09:13.134
PEOPLE LIKE BIRDS.

09:13.202 --> 09:14.969
I ALMOST GOT A PARROT ONCE,

09:15.003 --> 09:17.305
TILL I FOUND OUT
THEY LIVE TO BE 80.

09:17.373 --> 09:20.174
I DON'T NEED MY PET
OUTLIVING ME.

09:20.242 --> 09:21.792
I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

09:21.860 --> 09:24.294
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
WE ALL HIT IT OFF.

09:24.362 --> 09:26.296
HOW CAN THEY
NOT LIKE US?

09:26.364 --> 09:27.798
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN...

09:27.866 --> 09:29.299
THERE ARE PEOPLE
OUT IN THE WORLD

09:29.367 --> 09:31.401
WHO DON'T LIKE
SQUIRT CHEESE.

09:32.387 --> 09:36.457
BUT WE ALL GOTTA SHARE
THIS BIG SPINNING ROCK.

09:37.292 --> 09:38.475
I MEAN, YOU WERE FUNNY.

09:38.543 --> 09:39.810
<i>I KNOW THEY LIKED YOU.</i>

09:39.878 --> 09:42.179
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
I'M-I'M ELECTRIC.

09:43.882 --> 09:46.650
DO YOU THINK
IT WAS ME?

09:48.203 --> 09:50.404
NO.

09:50.472 --> 09:51.822
MY GOD, WAS IT ME?

09:51.890 --> 09:53.657
NO, NO, NO.
YOU'RE FUN AND... FEISTY.

09:53.725 --> 09:55.159
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
I'M FEISTY?

09:55.227 --> 09:57.194
LIKE I CAME ON
TOO STRONG?

09:57.262 --> 09:59.446
NOT AT ALL. YOU DIDN'T, NO. I MEAN...

09:59.514 --> 10:00.514
ALTHOUGH...

10:00.582 --> 10:01.799
NO, NO, NO-
WHAT?

10:01.866 --> 10:03.334
IT'S NOTHING!
WHAT? JUST TELL ME!

10:03.402 --> 10:04.602
OK, YOU-

10:04.670 --> 10:06.838
YOU REMEMBER AT DINNER
WHEN YOU...

10:06.905 --> 10:10.008
ASKED THE BUSBOY, LIKE,
3 TIMES FOR LEMONS?

10:10.075 --> 10:12.844
I THOUGHT I SAW PETER AND EMILY
THROW EACH OTHER A LOOK, LIKE...

10:12.911 --> 10:15.446
"OK... "

10:15.514 --> 10:18.699
OH, MY GOD,
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

10:18.767 --> 10:20.518
HEY, I LOVE IT WHEN YOU
MIX IT UP WITH THE HELP,

10:20.585 --> 10:24.522
BUT MAYBE THEY'RE JUST NOT
HIP ENOUGH TO "GET" YOU.

10:24.589 --> 10:27.258
YOU KNOW,
IT'S THEIR LOSS.

10:27.325 --> 10:28.576
I JUST THOUGHT
THIS WOULD BE A GREAT WAY

10:28.643 --> 10:30.044
TO OPEN UP OUR WORLD
A LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW?

10:30.112 --> 10:31.713
YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW,

10:31.780 --> 10:34.048
WE GOT A GREAT WORLD
RIGHT HERE IN QUEENS,

10:34.116 --> 10:36.884
WITH GREAT FRIENDS
WHO...

10:36.952 --> 10:39.386
LOVE US FOR WHO WE ARE.

10:41.289 --> 10:43.357
YOU'RE RIGHT, HONEY.

10:45.794 --> 10:47.161
THANKS, BABE.

10:50.732 --> 10:53.801
AND ALL IS QUIET
IN THE DOME.

11:04.363 --> 11:05.496
OH, HEY, EMILY.

11:05.564 --> 11:06.830
HEY, CARRIE.

11:10.369 --> 11:13.137
I JUST GOT,
LIKE, 70 MORE.

11:15.874 --> 11:17.925
SO DID YOU GUYS
END UP, UH,

11:17.993 --> 11:20.094
GETTING THAT BIRD
OR...

11:20.162 --> 11:21.179
OH, NO. NO.

11:21.329 --> 11:23.430
WE LOOKED AROUND,
BUT WE COULDN'T AGREE ON ONE.

11:23.498 --> 11:24.531
YEAH, IT'S HARD.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.239
EMILY, UH...

11:32.307 --> 11:34.057
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

11:34.125 --> 11:35.309
SURE.

11:35.376 --> 11:37.061
UH, DID I DO ANYTHING
THE OTHER NIGHT

11:37.129 --> 11:39.764
TO OFFEND YOU
IN ANY WAY?

11:39.832 --> 11:41.082
NO, NO. NOT AT ALL.

11:41.150 --> 11:43.217
I KNOW I CAN BE
OPINIONATED SOMETIMES.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.019
I TALK BEFORE I THINK,
AND I-

11:45.087 --> 11:46.637
CARRIE,
I THINK YOU'RE GREAT.

11:46.705 --> 11:47.871
REALLY.

11:47.939 --> 11:48.706
YOU DO?

11:48.774 --> 11:49.790
YEAH.

11:49.858 --> 11:51.058
OH.

11:51.126 --> 11:53.660
THEN YOU GUYS WANT TO
GET TOGETHER THIS WEEKEND?

11:53.728 --> 11:56.196
YEAH, UM... I DON'T THINK SO.

11:57.398 --> 11:59.333
OK. I MEAN,
IF YOU LIKE ME SO MUCH,

11:59.400 --> 12:01.936
HOW COME YOU NEVER WANT
TO HANG OUT WITH US?

12:02.003 --> 12:04.288
CARRIE... IT'S NOT YOU.

12:06.140 --> 12:07.508
DID YOU LIFT YOUR SHIRT

12:07.576 --> 12:09.710
AND MAKE THEM TOUCH
YOUR BELLY HAIR?!

12:11.380 --> 12:13.881
WHAT?!

12:13.949 --> 12:14.932
DID YOU?

12:14.999 --> 12:16.167
I LIFTED MY WHAT
AND MADE WHO-

12:16.234 --> 12:18.635
I- I-I-I CAN'T EVEN
FOLLOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING!

12:18.703 --> 12:21.005
YOU LIFTED YOUR SHIRT
AND MADE PETER AND EMILY

12:21.073 --> 12:22.506
TOUCH YOUR BELLY HAIR!

12:22.574 --> 12:24.341
OH, YEAH, OK, YEAH, AND THEN
I THREW ON A G-STRING

12:24.409 --> 12:27.145
AND GAVE PETER
A LAP DANCE. YEAH.

12:27.212 --> 12:28.980
OH, YEAH, OK, DOUG, WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING, EMILY'S LYING?

12:29.047 --> 12:30.081
WHY WOULD SHE LIE?

12:30.149 --> 12:31.148
OH, COME ON. YEAH-

12:31.216 --> 12:33.317
I LIFTED UP MY SHIRT
AND I MADE THEM TOUCH ME.

12:33.384 --> 12:35.285
THAT'S WHAT I DID.

12:35.353 --> 12:36.487
OH, GOD.

12:36.555 --> 12:37.988
10 YEARS TOGETHER,
CARRIE.

12:38.056 --> 12:41.492
10 YEARS,
YOU THINK YOU KNOW A PERSON.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.327
UNBELIEVABLE.
UNBELIEVABLE.

12:43.395 --> 12:46.631
THIS-THIS STINGS A LITTLE.
THIS-THIS STINGS...

12:46.698 --> 12:49.083
ALL RIGHT, L-LOOK,
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY,

12:49.150 --> 12:50.351
BUT WHY WOULD SHE...

12:50.419 --> 12:51.519
I DON'T KNOW,
YOU KNOW,

12:51.587 --> 12:53.454
BUT MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
YOU GUYS WORK TOGETHER

12:53.522 --> 12:55.872
AND SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS,

12:55.941 --> 12:57.207
SO SHE BLAMED ME.

12:57.275 --> 12:59.843
IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'M A
BIG BOY. I CAN TAKE IT.

13:01.179 --> 13:03.397
HONEY, I AM SO SORRY.

13:03.464 --> 13:05.366
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:05.434 --> 13:08.369
I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAVE TO
PUT UP WITH PEOPLE LIKE HER.

13:08.437 --> 13:10.637
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ME.

13:10.705 --> 13:12.139
IT'S LIKE I CAN'T
READ PEOPLE ANYMORE.

13:12.207 --> 13:14.841
IS IT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
OUT OF WORK FOR SO LONG?

13:14.909 --> 13:18.646
WE CAN ANALYZE THIS
TILL WE'RE BLUE IN THE FACE...

13:18.713 --> 13:20.147
THE POINT IS,

13:20.214 --> 13:22.082
IT'S BEHIND US.

13:22.150 --> 13:23.150
YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:23.218 --> 13:24.651
YOU ARE RIGHT.

13:24.719 --> 13:26.887
SCREW EMILY KORNBLUTH.

13:26.955 --> 13:28.405
YEAH!

13:28.473 --> 13:31.475
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE AT
MY OFFICE WE COULD HANG OUT WITH.

13:35.897 --> 13:37.164
SO HOW MUCH
WOULD IT TAKE

13:37.232 --> 13:40.217
FOR YOU GUYS TO GET IT
ON IN FRONT OF ME, HUH?

13:54.916 --> 13:56.267
MAY I?

13:56.334 --> 13:57.268
THANK YOU.

14:10.649 --> 14:11.999
COME ON.
WE'VE ALL WONDERED

14:12.067 --> 14:14.434
WHAT HUMAN FLESH
TASTES LIKE, RIGHT?

14:15.953 --> 14:18.238
SO, SERIOUSLY...
YOU IN?

14:35.123 --> 14:38.492
THERE YOU GO, BIG GUY.
HOW'S THAT FEEL?

14:38.559 --> 14:41.629
IT DIDN'T REALLY HURT TO BEGIN
WITH, BUT I'M NOT HATIN' IT.

14:41.696 --> 14:44.197
HOW LOW COULD YOU GO WITHOUT
FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE?

14:44.265 --> 14:46.900
AS LOW AS THE LAW
ALLOWS, MY FRIEND.

14:46.968 --> 14:49.269
OH, I'LL BE BACK
IN JUST A SECOND.

14:53.808 --> 14:55.575
HEY, KATE,
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

14:55.643 --> 14:56.660
OH, HEY.

14:56.728 --> 14:58.629
YEAH. JUST, UH,
KNOCKIN' ONE BACK

14:58.697 --> 15:00.397
WITH MY OLD PAL ARTHUR.

15:00.465 --> 15:03.450
GOD, HIS OWN FAMILY KEEPS HIM
LOCKED IN A BASEMENT ALL DAY.

15:03.518 --> 15:05.119
IT'S SAD.

15:05.186 --> 15:08.688
DAMN IT, I SAID I WASN'T
GONNA CRY ABOUT THIS.

15:08.756 --> 15:10.390
OH, YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT
LOOKS LIKE YOU AND YOUR FRIEND

15:10.458 --> 15:12.325
TAKE REALLY GOOD CARE
OF HIM.

15:12.393 --> 15:13.861
WHAT?

15:13.928 --> 15:17.381
YEAH, I GUESS LOOKING
AFTER HIM IS A LOT OF WORK.

15:17.448 --> 15:19.766
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE
WORK, THOUGH.

15:19.834 --> 15:23.003
IT FEELS A LOT MORE
LIKE LOVE.

15:23.071 --> 15:24.738
I LOVE YOU, TOO,
DANIEL.

15:24.805 --> 15:26.640
NOW, GIVE ME
A NICE CRISP PART

15:26.708 --> 15:28.942
LIKE DESI ARNAZ.

15:29.010 --> 15:30.711
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:30.778 --> 15:32.346
ARTHUR'S HAIR
WAS A LITTLE MESSY,

15:32.414 --> 15:33.914
SO I'M FIXING IT.

15:33.981 --> 15:35.950
OK, LEAVE HIM ALONE.
THIS IS MY THING.

15:36.017 --> 15:37.017
WELL, NOW IT'S OUR THING.

15:37.085 --> 15:38.352
NO, IT ISN'T.

15:38.420 --> 15:40.020
WHY DON'T YOU GO AWAY,
ALL RIGHT? I'M DOING HIS HAIR.

15:40.088 --> 15:41.238
UH, HEY, LOOK AT THE
TIME. I GOTTA FEED YOU.

15:41.306 --> 15:42.273

15:42.424 --> 15:43.691
I DON'T WANT A BREADSTICK.

15:43.759 --> 15:44.692
YES, YOU DO.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.126
SESAME SEEDS
MAKE MY GUMS INFLAMED.

15:46.194 --> 15:47.461
HEY, COME EAT.
THIS WAY.

15:47.529 --> 15:48.629
HEY, NOW STOP IT!

15:48.697 --> 15:50.063
THE TWO OF YOU
HAVE BEEN GROOMING ME,

15:50.131 --> 15:51.615
YOU'VE BEEN FEEDING ME...

15:51.683 --> 15:53.851
LETTING ME SIT ON YOUR LAP.

15:53.918 --> 15:55.569
WHAT GIVES?

15:55.636 --> 15:57.304
IT'S JUST...

15:57.372 --> 15:59.473
IT TURNS OUT WOMEN
KIND OF LIKE IT

15:59.541 --> 16:01.442
WHEN THEY SEE US
TAKING CARE OF YOU.

16:01.509 --> 16:04.595
SO I'M ONLY HERE SO YOU CAN
USE ME AS OLD MAN BAIT?

16:04.662 --> 16:06.296
YOU MAKE ME SICK.

16:06.364 --> 16:10.000
NOW, FINISH MY DESI
AND THEN I'M OUTTA HERE.

16:13.704 --> 16:16.306
HEY, DID I TELL YOU THAT
KELLY'S ON THE STEERING COMMITTEE

16:16.374 --> 16:18.642
FOR KIRBY'S MIDDLE SCHOOL?

16:18.709 --> 16:21.211
NO, BUT BACK THAT STORY UP,

16:21.279 --> 16:23.413
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO MISS A THING.

16:23.481 --> 16:25.499
COME ON, MAN.
I'M IN TROUBLE HERE.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.367
SHE'S TRYING TO MAKE FRIENDS
WITH THIS COUPLE SHE MET THERE-

16:27.435 --> 16:28.735
GEORGE AND VIOLA.

16:28.803 --> 16:32.689
I NEED TO KNOW HOW THIS
WHOLE DOME BUSINESS WORKS.

16:32.757 --> 16:35.809
OH, SO SOMEBODY WANTS A
LITTLE HELP FROM THE MASTER.

16:35.877 --> 16:37.010
YEAH, YEAH.
WALK ME THROUGH THIS.

16:37.078 --> 16:38.579
HOW DO I MAKE
THESE PEOPLE DISAPPEAR?

16:38.647 --> 16:41.848
WELL, THE FIRST THING YOU
DO IS YOU GO OUT WITH THEM.

16:41.916 --> 16:44.851
OK, YOU BE CHARMING, AND PRETEND
YOU'RE HAVING A GREAT TIME.

16:44.919 --> 16:48.355
AND WHEN KELLY LEAVES THE
ROOM, YOU MAKE YOUR MOVE.

16:48.423 --> 16:49.656
WHAT DO I DO?

16:49.724 --> 16:51.491
WELL, THERE ARE
A LOT OF OPTIONS.

16:51.559 --> 16:55.495
BUT I'M GONNA START YOU OFF
WITH A BASIC SHIRT LIFT.

16:55.563 --> 16:58.599
YOU MEAN LIKE THIS?

16:58.666 --> 17:01.801
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU
DON'T HAVE A TON OF HAIR.

17:01.869 --> 17:03.870
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GO NIPPLE.

17:06.307 --> 17:07.207
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.959
ANYTHING ELSE?

17:09.026 --> 17:12.079
SOMETIMES I LIKE TO THROW
IN A CRAZY LOOK, LIKE...

17:14.848 --> 17:16.767
THAT REALLY WORKS?

17:16.835 --> 17:18.652
I HAVE YET TO FIND
A GLITCH IN THE SYSTEM.

17:18.720 --> 17:22.656
EVERYBODY HATES ME, I HATE
THEM, AND I AM QUITTING.

17:22.723 --> 17:23.890
THAT'S IT. I'VE HAD IT.

17:25.893 --> 17:27.611
AND THERE'S
THE FIRST GLITCH.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.802
HEY, BABE. YOU'RE NOT REALLY THINKING
ABOUT QUITTING YOUR JOB, ARE YOU?

17:35.870 --> 17:38.405
YEAH, I AM. OK? I'M LOOKING
THROUGH THE WANT ADS RIGHT NOW.

17:38.473 --> 17:39.907
I REFUSE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE

17:39.975 --> 17:41.641
THAT I HAVE TO BEG
TO BE MY FRIEND, ALL RIGHT?

17:41.709 --> 17:43.511
I'M A VERY SWEET
AND NICE PERSON.

17:43.578 --> 17:45.713
THEY CAN ALL BITE ME.

17:45.780 --> 17:47.381
YOU JUST HAD A BAD DAY.

17:47.448 --> 17:49.015
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I
KNOW WHAT'LL CHEER YOU UP.

17:49.083 --> 17:50.884
HOW ABOUT WE
GRAB SOME CHINESE, HUH?

17:50.951 --> 17:51.919
NO, I'M NOT HUNGRY.

17:51.986 --> 17:53.220

18:03.565 --> 18:05.900
YOU KNOW WHAT? FIND SOMEONE
ELSE. WE'LL GO OUT WITH THEM.

18:05.967 --> 18:06.817

18:06.884 --> 18:08.135
IT'LL WORK OUT

18:08.202 --> 18:09.820
REALLY? HOW DO YOU
KNOW THAT, DOUG?

18:09.888 --> 18:12.505
BECAUSE THIS TIME YOU WON'T
YELL AT A BUSBOY ABOUT LEMONS,

18:12.573 --> 18:15.642
AND I WON'T
"LIFT MY SHIRT."

18:17.061 --> 18:18.678
COME ON. YOU WORK WITH,
LIKE, A MILLION PEOPLE.

18:18.746 --> 18:21.215
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMEONE

18:22.417 --> 18:24.451
WELL, I KIND OF KNOW

18:48.109 --> 18:49.626
THERE YOU GO, WHITEY.

18:49.694 --> 18:52.296
IT SEEMS YOU HAD SOME
MARSHMALLOW ON YOUR CHIN.

18:52.363 --> 18:53.530

18:53.597 --> 18:55.882

19:10.030 --> 19:13.500
BUZZ OFF. I GOT MY OWN
THING WORKING RIGHT NOW.

19:13.568 --> 19:14.834
WAIT-WAIT A MINUTE.

19:14.902 --> 19:17.404
YOU'RE DOING EXACTLY
WHAT YOU YELLED AT US FOR.

19:17.472 --> 19:18.672
DOING WHAT?

19:18.740 --> 19:21.491
NEVER MIND WHAT I'M DOING!
JUST LOOK PATHETIC.

19:21.559 --> 19:24.661
HE'S USING YOU BECAUSE
WOMEN ARE ATTRACTED TO MEN

19:24.729 --> 19:26.896
WHO TAKE CARE OF
THE ELDERLY.

19:26.964 --> 19:28.181

19:28.249 --> 19:31.117

19:35.824 --> 19:38.925

SOLD NEWSPAPERS.

19:38.993 --> 19:42.028
THEN I GOT THE IDEA
TO SELL GUM AND CANDY.

19:42.096 --> 19:44.698
THEN I PUT IN
THE CHIP RACK,

19:44.766 --> 19:46.199
AND KNOCK ON WOOD,

19:46.267 --> 19:50.103
NEXT MONTH WE'RE GETTING
A CHAPSTICK DISPENSER.

19:50.171 --> 19:53.440
WOW. IT'S A GOOD TIME
IN OUR LIVES.

19:53.508 --> 19:55.542
WELL, I'M GONNA GET
SOME MORE COFFEE.

19:55.610 --> 19:57.778

IF ANYTHING BOTHERS YOU. OK?

20:03.418 --> 20:04.968

20:05.035 --> 20:07.303
<i>HEY, YOU GUYS
EVER PLAY BALDERDASH?</i>

20:07.371 --> 20:08.588
HMM?

20:08.656 --> 20:10.057
THE BOARD GAME.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.893
YOU MAKE UP FAKE
DICTIONARY DEFINITIONS.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.561
IT'S HILARIOUS.

20:14.629 --> 20:17.397
WE'RE IN A LEAGUE EVERY
TUESDAY AND FRIDAY.

20:17.465 --> 20:18.899
MAYBE YOU COULD JOIN.

20:18.967 --> 20:22.369
<i>"IF YOU LOVE WORDS,
YOU'LL LOVE BALDERDASH."</i>

20:24.038 --> 20:26.807
YEAH. AND DENNIS HERE,

20:26.875 --> 20:29.710
HE ALWAYS MAKES
THIS INCREDIBLE CHILI.

20:29.777 --> 20:31.695
IT IS DELICIOUS.

20:31.763 --> 20:32.963
NO MEAT.

20:33.031 --> 20:35.065
