WEBVTT

00:04.205 --> 00:05.870
- [TV Man] I want you
to be comfortable.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.539
- [TV Woman] I want you
to be comfortable too.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.608
- [TV Man] Is it
alright if I touch you?

00:09.743 --> 00:11.409
- [TV Woman] Take your cock out.

00:11.411 --> 00:14.013
- [TV Man] I wanna watch
you do something first.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.548
- [TV Woman] OK.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.083
- [TV Man] Rub yourself for me.

00:18.953 --> 00:19.818
- [TV Woman] Like this?

00:19.953 --> 00:21.820
- [TV Man] Yeah, just like that.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.124
- [TV Woman] Oh God,
come here and rub me.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.761
- What else did
this Director do?

00:28.763 --> 00:31.095
- He did that
mystery, the boy who

00:31.097 --> 00:32.831
goes back in time, Evergreen.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.033
- Yeah, yeah, I saw that.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.501
It was a good movie.

00:36.637 --> 00:37.770
- Yeah, that one was
good, that was good.

00:37.772 --> 00:39.437
- So good.

00:39.439 --> 00:44.242
- He must have a really
great cinematographer,

00:44.244 --> 00:46.110
ya know, his movies are
always so beautifully,

00:46.112 --> 00:47.045
beautifully shot.

00:47.180 --> 00:47.980
- They are.

00:48.115 --> 00:49.514
- Right?
- They are.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.916
- [TV Woman] Oh God, that's it.

00:51.918 --> 00:53.518
- [TV Man] Feels so good.

00:53.654 --> 00:57.189
(sexual moaning)

00:57.191 --> 00:58.257
Oh God.

01:03.798 --> 01:05.197
- Mom.

01:05.199 --> 01:07.932
You're missing the
best part of the movie.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.202
- Oh my God, what
are you watching?

01:10.204 --> 01:12.004
- The movie you selected.

01:12.006 --> 01:14.406
You know what, why
don't I rewind it.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.674
- No, no, that's OK.

01:15.676 --> 01:16.941
- You know what, you're right.

01:16.943 --> 01:17.810
It'll be faster if
I just recap it.

01:17.812 --> 01:19.211
So he said, "Let me touch you."

01:19.346 --> 01:20.479
She said, "Take your cock out,"

01:20.614 --> 01:23.148
and then he did
some stuff with it

01:23.284 --> 01:24.817
and then, that's pretty
much where we are.

01:24.952 --> 01:25.884
So I think we're good now.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.019
Should I press play?

01:27.021 --> 01:28.353
Great.

01:28.355 --> 01:29.621
- [Mom] I think we're
just gonna head home.

01:29.623 --> 01:32.825
- Mom, shh, we're
watching the movie now.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.159
Thank you.

01:34.161 --> 01:36.862
(sexual moaning)

01:39.300 --> 01:41.767
(upbeat music)

01:57.518 --> 01:59.518
- Well I can never look
Leon in the eye again.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.453
- Where else do you feel
comfortable looking?

02:01.588 --> 02:05.858
- I feel like now, I'm only
full direct eye contact

02:05.860 --> 02:08.460
with Leon, I don't look
up, I don't look down.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.062
- Oh God.

02:10.064 --> 02:11.530
- You know what, tomorrow
night, instead of going out,

02:11.665 --> 02:13.331
maybe Jennifer and I
will just rewatch that,

02:13.467 --> 02:16.401
call it quits on our
friendship forever.

02:16.403 --> 02:18.070
- So if you guys don't
watch pornography tomorrow,

02:18.205 --> 02:19.337
what are you doing?

02:19.339 --> 02:20.472
- If we don't watch pornography,

02:20.607 --> 02:22.140
she wants to do an escape room.

02:22.142 --> 02:22.941
- Oh, sounds like fun.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.342
- Yeah.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.544
- You know, other than the
fact that I had to watch it

02:25.679 --> 02:27.212
with Leon, I thought
that other little scene

02:27.348 --> 02:30.549
at the end of the movie
was not so terrible.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.816
- Which scene?

02:31.818 --> 02:33.285
- Ya know, the one
where they were

02:33.420 --> 02:35.554
acting out their fantasies?

02:35.689 --> 02:38.290
- Ooh, ala, Miguel!

02:38.425 --> 02:43.228
Is that something you'd be
interested in exploring?

02:43.230 --> 02:44.629
- Maybe.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.031
I mean, I've tried to get
it going a couple times.

02:47.033 --> 02:49.634
It just wasn't always
something you wanted to do.

02:49.636 --> 02:50.903
- What, when did you do that?

02:51.038 --> 02:52.237
- Oh, a couple times.

02:52.239 --> 02:53.638
- And I didn't wanna do it?

02:53.774 --> 02:55.774
I'll be honest, that
does not sound like me.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.776
- I don't think it was something
that you didn't wanna do,

02:57.778 --> 02:59.111
it was just that you kinda
always turn everything

02:59.246 --> 03:01.313
into a bit and then
we lose our focus.

03:01.448 --> 03:04.116
- I'm not allowed to joke
during these fantasies?

03:04.118 --> 03:06.384
- There's a difference between
having fun in the fantasy

03:06.386 --> 03:09.054
and shitting on the fantasy.

03:09.190 --> 03:10.322
- Unless shitting
is the fantasy.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.990
- OK, this was fun.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.793
- No, no, no, if this is
something you wanna do,

03:14.928 --> 03:16.661
let's do it!

03:16.663 --> 03:17.930
- Yeah, alright, when
do you wanna do it?

03:18.065 --> 03:21.800
- Well, I mean, that
hundred and 32 minutes of

03:21.935 --> 03:25.670
sensual cinema with Leon left
me pretty satisfied sexually.

03:25.806 --> 03:29.073
- These are the kinda
bits I'm referring to.

03:29.075 --> 03:31.210
- I wish that had been a bit.

03:32.412 --> 03:33.678
Alright.

03:33.814 --> 03:37.482
♪ We're gonna fantasize
honestly comin' at you ♪

03:37.618 --> 03:42.521
♪ Get ready Mike, I'm
gonna fantasize with you ♪

03:43.290 --> 03:45.891
(upbeat jazzy music)

03:48.962 --> 03:49.762
- Yes!

03:49.897 --> 03:51.496
Four minutes to spare.

03:51.498 --> 03:52.831
- That was actually really fast.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.633
- I know, once I figured
out the newspaper clippings,

03:54.635 --> 03:56.501
it's just like
everything went so fast.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.503
- What the fuck was that?

03:58.639 --> 04:02.507
And why was I blindfolded
and handcuffed?

04:02.509 --> 04:04.242
- Because it was the
cannibal-hillbilly room.

04:04.377 --> 04:06.244
- Right, yes, lovely.

04:06.379 --> 04:08.913
- That was fun when we, the
thing, it's like science

04:09.049 --> 04:10.182
and the door opened.

04:10.184 --> 04:12.851
- Fun like when you're
being sexually assaulted

04:12.853 --> 04:14.186
and then it ends.

04:14.321 --> 04:15.320
I'm gonna need a minute.

04:15.322 --> 04:16.388
Can I have some water?

04:16.523 --> 04:17.522
- Yeah, there's
some right there.

04:17.524 --> 04:18.590
- Thank you.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.793
Why would you have
brought me here?

04:20.795 --> 04:21.994
- I'm sorry.

04:21.996 --> 04:23.261
- Are you?

04:23.263 --> 04:25.130
- Oh my God, you jumped
so high when that guy

04:25.266 --> 04:26.931
jumped out with the banjo.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.333
- You know why?

04:28.469 --> 04:31.003
Because I'm a human being
and we have fight or flight

04:31.138 --> 04:34.473
instincts that are triggered
when men jump out of

04:34.475 --> 04:38.076
closets in strange places
in rooms that I thought

04:38.078 --> 04:40.545
I was alone in for 35 minutes.

04:40.547 --> 04:41.680
- Let's do another one.

04:41.815 --> 04:42.681
Will you do another one with me?

04:42.816 --> 04:43.948
- No, I will not.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.150
I will never.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.152
Don't give me that face.
- So boring!

04:47.154 --> 04:50.489
- You know what the most
devastating part of this

04:50.491 --> 04:52.090
horror show actually was?

04:52.092 --> 04:53.425
- What?

04:53.560 --> 04:56.761
- Remember when we were looking
for decapitated dolls heads

04:56.897 --> 04:58.963
in the garage of the
slaughtered family?

04:58.965 --> 04:59.631
(laughing)

04:59.767 --> 05:01.366
You are a sick person.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.168
- It wasn't real and
they were doll heads.

05:03.170 --> 05:06.304
- Anyway, they had all those
stacks, did you see them?

05:06.440 --> 05:08.507
Of emergency canned
foods and water?

05:08.642 --> 05:10.108
- Right.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.376
- Yeah, Mike and I have
had that on our to-do list

05:11.378 --> 05:12.977
for over a year and we
haven't done jack shit.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.713
So that was a real
slap in the face.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.849
I don't want serial killers
being more prepared than I am.

05:16.851 --> 05:18.316
- Sorry.

05:18.452 --> 05:21.119
- OK, I think I slowed
my heart rate down enough

05:21.121 --> 05:22.254
to head to the car.

05:22.256 --> 05:23.522
- Oh you wanna just go home?

05:23.657 --> 05:25.057
You don't wanna go get
a drink or something?

05:25.059 --> 05:26.525
- Happy to do that but
you know you are Jennifer

05:26.660 --> 05:29.061
and there's probably an Agents
of Shield marathon somewhere.

05:29.063 --> 05:30.395
Just saying.

05:30.397 --> 05:31.796
- Come on, I don't
wanna go home yet.

05:31.798 --> 05:32.865
- Oh, you don't?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.533
- I've been divorced
for a year and a half

05:34.535 --> 05:37.135
and you have to like find
things to fill your time,

05:37.137 --> 05:38.803
like Agents of Shield.

05:38.805 --> 05:40.272
- OK.
- Or drinking on Tuesdays.

05:40.274 --> 05:43.075
- You know it's
after 9:30, right?

05:43.077 --> 05:43.942
- Yeah, I get that.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.211
- OK, let's do it.

05:46.213 --> 05:49.013
Let's go to a bar on a
Tuesday night, right?

05:49.015 --> 05:51.750
I fucking see you.

05:52.887 --> 05:53.952
- Jesus!

05:53.954 --> 05:54.819
- It's fine.

05:54.821 --> 05:55.754
- Thank you.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.823
(upbeat music)

05:58.825 --> 05:59.958
- Hey, you're still up.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.894
- Hi, I was starting to
think you didn't escape

06:01.896 --> 06:03.762
and I was gonna have
to raise Amelia alone.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.163
- Oh yeah?

06:05.165 --> 06:06.030
How'd that look to you?

06:06.032 --> 06:06.699
- Not that bad.

06:06.834 --> 06:07.832
- Finally.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.367
- How's Jennifer?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.770
- Honestly, she seems
likes, she's like a little

06:11.772 --> 06:13.037
manic or something.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.439
- [Mike] Manic? How?

06:14.575 --> 06:16.641
- I don't know, like she's
trying to distract herself.

06:16.643 --> 06:19.778
Just hate having to watch
Jennifer struggle like this.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.647
Fucking Scott and
his cheating dick.

06:22.649 --> 06:26.251
Ya know, I dream about
the day that I bump into

06:26.253 --> 06:27.719
fucking Scott.

06:27.722 --> 06:30.855
There's gonna be some event, a
birthday party with the kids.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.191
He'll say, "Hi,"
and I'll say, "Hi."

06:33.193 --> 06:36.128
And then ya know, he'll go like,
"Oh God, I haven't seen you

06:36.130 --> 06:37.462
"in so long, how are you?"

06:37.464 --> 06:39.063
And I will look him
in the eyes and say,

06:39.065 --> 06:43.335
"I'm not interested
in doing this."

06:43.337 --> 06:46.004
And then I will walk away.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.006
- Wow, that's gonna sting.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.874
- It's the things
I'm not saying.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.009
He will get it.

06:51.011 --> 06:51.844
- Scathing.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.481
- Ugh, thank you for not putting
your dick in other people.

06:56.483 --> 06:57.682
- It's the least I could do.

06:57.684 --> 06:58.683
- Literally.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.285
Ugh, that feels good.

07:00.421 --> 07:01.886
I had a rough night,
I was handcuffed.

07:01.888 --> 07:04.957
- Oh, is that something
that sparks your interest?

07:04.959 --> 07:06.491
- I don't know, I've never
really thought about it.

07:06.493 --> 07:09.427
- What are your fantasies,
out of curiosity?

07:09.429 --> 07:10.229
- Mike.

07:11.364 --> 07:12.831
- What?

07:12.833 --> 07:15.300
- I don't wanna use any
of my life stock footage.

07:15.302 --> 07:16.901
- Stock footage?

07:17.037 --> 07:19.838
- You know, the stuff that
I have used for years.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.775
I don't wanna muck it up.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.977
- How am I gonna muck it up?

07:24.979 --> 07:27.245
There's just certain dialog
that needs to be said

07:27.380 --> 07:30.248
in a very specific way and
I don't wanna make you feel

07:30.383 --> 07:32.250
badly by giving
you line readings.

07:32.386 --> 07:33.852
- Wow.

07:33.854 --> 07:34.987
- Or you need to
move your position

07:35.122 --> 07:38.190
or Mike, think about
your fantasies, OK?

07:38.325 --> 07:41.994
Imagine me in there
just going off script.

07:42.129 --> 07:42.861
- Good point.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.396
- Right?
- Yep.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.064
- Let's think of
something new between us.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.532
- OK.

07:47.668 --> 07:48.933
- I'm kinda looking
forward to this actually.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.335
- Me too!

07:50.337 --> 07:51.470
- Let's get this going.

07:51.472 --> 07:52.337
- But not tonight, right?

07:52.473 --> 07:53.205
It's 12:30.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.274
- God, no, we're not animals.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.610
(jazzy music)

07:58.746 --> 08:00.945
Mom, you're a person who's
been divorced a lot, right?

08:01.081 --> 08:03.015
- I'm so glad I came over.

08:03.017 --> 08:05.217
- Just when did you start
feeling like normal again?

08:05.352 --> 08:06.618
Jennifer's having a rough go.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.687
- Well, she's gotta
start dating again.

08:08.689 --> 08:09.888
Is she dating again?

08:10.023 --> 08:12.491
- Mom, that is not
the only way to

08:12.493 --> 08:14.292
get over something like this.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.561
- Well, worked for me twice.

08:16.563 --> 08:17.962
Just kidding.

08:18.099 --> 08:19.565
Not really.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.100
- Jesus, no.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.102
- It was hard, but
then when it got hard,

08:24.237 --> 08:25.970
I just relied on
family and friends.

08:26.107 --> 08:27.572
- Well, I tried to talk
to her the other night,

08:27.574 --> 08:30.575
but she wanted to battle
humans that were trying to

08:30.711 --> 08:32.377
eat our flesh.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.246
- Well, just keep
doing things with her.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.580
- I'm trying!

08:35.582 --> 08:37.249
- And pick a place
where it's easy to talk,

08:37.251 --> 08:38.983
like a flower arranging class.

08:38.985 --> 08:41.119
- A flower arranging class?

08:41.254 --> 08:43.321
Have you been to a
flower arranging class?

08:43.323 --> 08:45.390
- No, but I imagine.

08:45.392 --> 08:46.859
- What? You imagine what?

08:46.994 --> 08:48.660
- Well I imagine that being nice

08:48.663 --> 08:50.663
and what are you doing
with all these cans?

08:50.798 --> 08:51.996
- I'm just putting them

08:51.998 --> 08:53.666
in the garage in
case of an emergency.

08:53.801 --> 08:54.799
- You know you can
buy these kits.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.134
Leon bought a great one.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.070
It has flares and
batteries and a machete.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.206
It's fun to see Leon
holding a machete.

09:01.342 --> 09:02.675
I just wanna say.

09:02.810 --> 09:06.144
- If Leon has to cut paths in
forests that have never been

09:06.279 --> 09:08.280
foraged before, I'm not
sure that's a disaster

09:08.415 --> 09:10.415
you wanna survive.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.817
- Well, at least I'm prepared.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.018
Oh you know what you should do.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.353
You should get one
of those smoke alarms

09:15.355 --> 09:17.021
where you record your own voice.

09:17.023 --> 09:18.557
- Why would anyone
wanna do that?

09:18.559 --> 09:21.025
- Because a mother's voice
is more like to wake up

09:21.027 --> 09:22.694
a child than even
a regular alarm.

09:22.697 --> 09:24.162
- Not your voice though.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.165
Your voice is like the
music they play at a flower

09:27.167 --> 09:30.168
arranging class,
it's so soothing.

09:30.170 --> 09:33.505
- You do know these chick
peas expired in 2014?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.107
- Mom, let's be honest.

09:35.109 --> 09:37.175
If there's a real emergency,
I'm just using the jagged lids

09:37.310 --> 09:38.643
to slit my wrists.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.245
This is all for show.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.982
(jazzy music)

09:43.984 --> 09:45.050
- Hey, are these the
smoke alarms your mom

09:45.185 --> 09:45.984
was talking about?

09:46.120 --> 09:47.186
- Let me see.

09:47.321 --> 09:48.587
Oh yeah, we should
get a couple of those.

09:48.589 --> 09:49.454
- OK.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.923
- Oh, look at that family.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.792
They got some stories to tell.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.061
- They're awfully calm for
their house being on fire.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.730
- Yeah, there's a sadness
behind this guy's eyes.

09:58.732 --> 09:59.931
I think he started the fire.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.332
- [Mike] I don't think he did.

10:01.469 --> 10:03.402
- Look at the way his
shirt's tucked in.

10:03.537 --> 10:06.471
- Oh, you're correct.
- That kid is worked up.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.940
I like the couple
though, they look nice.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.810
I would wanna be with
them in an emergency.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.612
- Yeah, would you trust
me in an emergency?

10:13.747 --> 10:15.080
- I don't know.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.216
What kind of emergency ya got?

10:17.351 --> 10:19.684
- Ms. Warren, I don't know
how to tell you this but,

10:19.686 --> 10:24.155
there's no way outta this bunker
and help is not on the way.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.392
- Oh really?

10:28.162 --> 10:31.230
OK well, then I guess
it's just the two of us

10:31.365 --> 10:35.668
alone in the bunker then.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.638
- Well I can think of a couple
ways to pass the time, ma'am.

10:39.640 --> 10:43.174
- (laughs) Sorry, the
ma'am threw me off.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.576
I'm not making jokes, I promise.

10:44.578 --> 10:48.847
I'm not laughing, I
just, I'm just hot

10:48.849 --> 10:50.782
because there's no
windows in the bunker

10:50.918 --> 10:54.453
and I can't get a cross breeze.

10:55.523 --> 10:58.457
And it's making it stuffy.

10:58.592 --> 11:01.326
- Maybe you just have
on too many clothes.

11:01.461 --> 11:04.263
- This is the uniform
I was issued, so,

11:04.398 --> 11:05.864
I don't really--

11:05.866 --> 11:07.900
- What do you have
on underneath?

11:09.136 --> 11:10.602
- Sorry, do you want
me to make something up

11:10.604 --> 11:12.537
or say what you're actually
gonna see in like two seconds?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.405
- Either way.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.807
- Either way?

11:15.809 --> 11:18.743
Alright, well then, what
I'm wearing underneath

11:18.745 --> 11:23.716
is a lacey bra and
a very small thong.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.356
- I really wanna see that.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.758
- Yeah?

11:32.893 --> 11:36.161
- Yeah, so, what do I gotta
do to get you to show me?

11:36.163 --> 11:39.364
- I mean, I think
you'll have to show me

11:39.499 --> 11:42.434
what it's worth to
you, Lieutenant.

11:42.570 --> 11:47.038
OK sorry, everything I'm
saying is sounding crazy.

11:47.174 --> 11:47.906
- No, it's not.

11:48.042 --> 11:51.242
- Yes it, Mike, yes it.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.644
I don't know why
I can't do this!

11:52.780 --> 11:54.045
- Honey, don't worry about it.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.114
It's not a big deal.

11:55.249 --> 11:57.116
- I know it's not a
big deal but I am,

11:57.118 --> 11:59.250
I feel like it's weird.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.052
This seems like
something I would crush!

12:01.188 --> 12:03.655
- Maybe we finally found
your achilles heel.

12:03.791 --> 12:07.726
- I always knew it was
gonna be my vagina.

12:07.728 --> 12:08.927
Didn't you?

12:09.063 --> 12:09.928
- Yep.

12:10.064 --> 12:12.397
(upbeat music)

12:12.532 --> 12:14.065
- Don't you think it's
strange though that

12:14.201 --> 12:15.534
I can't role play?

12:15.536 --> 12:17.669
Doesn't that seem like
something I would excel at?

12:17.805 --> 12:18.937
- No!

12:19.073 --> 12:20.472
- Wow!

12:20.608 --> 12:24.943
- Well, I'm sorry but you're
obviously uncomfortable

12:25.079 --> 12:26.945
and when you, Andrew,
are uncomfortable,

12:27.081 --> 12:28.480
then you make jokes.

12:28.616 --> 12:33.218
- OK, how can anybody earnestly
pretend to fuck in a bunker

12:33.220 --> 12:35.887
without sounding crazy?

12:35.889 --> 12:37.689
- Obviously I
think there is some

12:37.691 --> 12:39.958
suspension of
disbelief involved.

12:40.094 --> 12:42.694
- So much suspension, come on!

12:42.696 --> 12:44.896
You know, Mike is
oddly good at it.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.097
It's annoying.

12:46.233 --> 12:49.234
He's able to just
focus in and not laugh.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.502
- That makes sense to me.

12:50.638 --> 12:52.103
- What?!

12:52.105 --> 12:53.104
- Well, he's always been more
comfortable being vulnerable

12:53.240 --> 12:56.641
than ya know, this debacle.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.377
- I mean, I'm not gonna
argue with you about it but--

12:58.379 --> 13:01.580
- I think you just have to
do the uncomfortable part.

13:01.582 --> 13:03.715
You have to be like, I'm
not comfortable with this.

13:03.717 --> 13:06.651
I'm gonna do it anyway and
just dive and have ya know,

13:06.653 --> 13:10.255
bunker scientist sex
with your husband.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.924
- Wait, you think we were
supposed to be scientists?

13:13.060 --> 13:16.127
I feel like if I had known
that, I could've found a way

13:16.263 --> 13:17.662
into my role, right?

13:17.664 --> 13:20.732
- Yeah, I feel like incision
backstory was definitely

13:20.734 --> 13:21.933
your problem.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.535
- Thank you for
acknowledging that.

13:23.671 --> 13:25.004
- You're welcome.

13:25.139 --> 13:27.973
- I mean, otherwise, how am
I supposed to know who I am?

13:29.076 --> 13:30.675
So how was your week?

13:30.677 --> 13:31.476
- It's fine.

13:31.611 --> 13:32.343
- Yeah?

13:32.480 --> 13:33.678
- Yep.

13:33.814 --> 13:34.546
- Scott's got the
boys all weekend?

13:34.682 --> 13:35.947
- Yeah.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.216
- How are things
going with you guys?

13:37.351 --> 13:39.084
- I don't wanna talk about it.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.886
Just boring and--

13:40.888 --> 13:42.153
- OK!

13:42.155 --> 13:44.022
- So where are we going?

13:44.025 --> 13:45.691
- Again, don't be afraid
to put two flowers

13:45.826 --> 13:47.492
next to each other that
you wouldn't expect.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.828
Like a dahlia and a daisy.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.764
Give yourself permission to
really push the boundaries.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.699
- Listen, you picked
this, alright?

13:54.701 --> 13:56.367
Go back to your own vase.

13:56.504 --> 13:58.770
- OK, but I've been
given permission to
push the boundaries.

13:58.906 --> 14:01.907
Hold onto your tits, I'm
going heavy with the sprigs.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.775
All sprigs all day.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.110
- Jesus Christ.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.915
I just feel like this is
like, doesn't look good.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.850
Are you using the
black eyes Susans or?

14:11.852 --> 14:13.285
- I don't know.

14:14.721 --> 14:17.522
By the way, black eyed
Susan, not a terrible name

14:17.524 --> 14:19.190
for future fantasy play.

14:19.326 --> 14:20.592
I'll just be a woman
name Susan who's been

14:20.728 --> 14:22.661
punched in the face twice.

14:22.663 --> 14:24.463
Let Mike be earnest with that.

14:24.465 --> 14:25.664
- Damn it.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.400
- I think that's good.

14:28.536 --> 14:29.868
- It's missing something, I
don't know what it's missing.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.070
- Look at mine.

14:31.205 --> 14:32.537
Mine looks like a middle
of a Timelines video

14:32.672 --> 14:33.639
about life and death.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.977
OK ya know what, let's get up.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.485
(sniffling)

14:46.487 --> 14:48.287
- OK, I'm OK, I'm OK.

14:48.422 --> 14:52.023
- You just burst out crying
because your practice

14:52.159 --> 14:54.426
flower arrangement
was too crowded.

14:54.562 --> 14:57.162
You're not 100%.
(laughing)

14:57.164 --> 14:59.965
- I'm just really
starting to get scared,

15:00.100 --> 15:04.169
like I'm ya know, like
Scott is dating again

15:04.171 --> 15:07.372
and I feel like I've
grieved, but I'm just stuck.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.975
Like why can't I move past this?

15:10.110 --> 15:11.510
- Because you just haven't yet.

15:11.645 --> 15:13.112
You need more time.

15:13.114 --> 15:14.980
- What if I never get over this?

15:16.183 --> 15:18.383
- Then I'll stop
hanging out with you.

15:18.385 --> 15:19.518
(laughing)

15:19.520 --> 15:21.452
- OK, that's fair.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.789
Oh God.

15:23.791 --> 15:25.857
- You know that I am constantly
dreaming about the day

15:25.859 --> 15:29.194
I get to tell off your dick
blister of an ex-husband.

15:29.196 --> 15:30.729
- That's sweet, thank you.

15:30.864 --> 15:33.264
- Well, I'm not
vulnerable for shit,

15:33.266 --> 15:34.566
but I'm sweet as fuck.

15:36.203 --> 15:37.002
- (laughs) Yeah.

15:38.739 --> 15:40.205
I know I'm gonna be fine.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.406
- Of course!

15:41.541 --> 15:44.810
- Ya know, I'm gonna
date again and have sex

15:44.945 --> 15:47.479
and have a normal
life and everything.

15:47.615 --> 15:51.583
- When is the last
time you had sex?

15:52.620 --> 15:54.153
- Not since Scott.

15:54.155 --> 15:56.287
- 18 months ago?

15:56.289 --> 15:57.622
- I know.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.891
- Well let me apologize
for bringing you

15:59.893 --> 16:01.560
to a flower arranging class.

16:01.695 --> 16:05.697
All those dewey petals
and swollen stamens

16:05.699 --> 16:08.567
must have been hard
for you to be around.

16:08.702 --> 16:11.036
- Do you wanna have
sex with these flowers?

16:11.171 --> 16:13.272
- I mean, if you're
not, I'd bang a dahlia.

16:15.509 --> 16:17.609
(jazzy music)

16:17.745 --> 16:19.277
Wow!

16:19.279 --> 16:20.479
- Were you impressed by
the way I just effortlessly

16:20.614 --> 16:22.414
installed our new smoke alarm.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.282
- My mom did something
similar in her house,

16:24.418 --> 16:26.351
so once again, ya know,
the similarities between

16:26.353 --> 16:28.687
you and my mother are striking.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.222
- Oh, thank you.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.090
- You know what, you're welcome!

16:32.092 --> 16:33.091
That's great!

16:33.093 --> 16:34.092
I am excited now.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.560
Thank you for doing that.

16:35.696 --> 16:36.829
- What time is Jennifer
picking you up?

16:36.831 --> 16:38.096
- 20 minutes?

16:38.231 --> 16:40.432
- Aren't you exhausted
going out so much?

16:40.434 --> 16:42.300
- Yes, I'm so tired.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.836
But at least this is the
cooking class that I love.

16:43.838 --> 16:46.304
- Oh, then I'll be getting
something out of it.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.841
- By the way, I just recently
found out that Jennifer

16:48.976 --> 16:52.577
has not had sex in
almost a year and a half.

16:52.713 --> 16:53.445
- Jesus.

16:53.447 --> 16:54.847
- I know!

16:54.982 --> 16:56.048
I think I'm gonna get her a
vibrator for her birthday.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.115
- You are?

16:57.250 --> 16:58.250
Why?

16:58.252 --> 16:59.784
- Because they're awesome.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.787
- Wait, do you have a vibrator?

17:02.789 --> 17:04.389
- Of course!

17:04.391 --> 17:05.390
- [Mike] Really?

17:05.392 --> 17:07.392
- Yes! You know that!

17:07.528 --> 17:08.660
- No I didn't.

17:08.663 --> 17:10.929
How often do you
use your vibrator?

17:11.064 --> 17:13.198
- Whenever the mood strikes.

17:13.334 --> 17:16.000
Although recently, I've
had to engage in more

17:16.002 --> 17:19.404
traditional, labor
intensive methods.

17:19.406 --> 17:20.739
- What does that mean?

17:20.874 --> 17:23.408
- Just ya know,
vibrators can kinda

17:23.544 --> 17:26.144
desensitize things and
make it harder for me

17:26.146 --> 17:30.215
to enjoy the fruits
of your loins.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.483
- Well, that
doesn't sound great.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.285
- I know, that's why I
stopped, which sucks,

17:33.287 --> 17:36.221
because I'm a very
lazy masturbator.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.689
- OK, good to know.

17:37.692 --> 17:41.293
- I mean, this was not like
an easy decision to come to,

17:41.428 --> 17:44.162
Mike, I mean, keep
using my vibrator

17:44.164 --> 17:45.297
or have better sex
with my husband.

17:45.432 --> 17:48.100
It was a real Sophie's choice.

17:48.102 --> 17:50.969
And by Sophie, I obviously
mean Amelia's friend Sophie,

17:50.971 --> 17:52.771
'cause ya know, she's the
only one I can really go to

17:52.773 --> 17:53.972
for stuff like this.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.240
- Ugh.

17:55.376 --> 17:56.708
- What, you want
me to go to Izzy?

17:56.711 --> 17:59.043
Please, that girl
has never orgasmed.

17:59.045 --> 18:00.579
- Are you proud of yourself?

18:00.581 --> 18:03.047
- Not really.

18:03.184 --> 18:05.250
I don't know why this
stuff pops in my head.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.018
But it does.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.922
(upbeat music)

18:13.127 --> 18:14.593
- Everything smells so amazing.

18:14.728 --> 18:15.660
- My God, I know.

18:15.662 --> 18:16.595
- I love Mediterranean food.

18:16.730 --> 18:18.130
- I know.

18:18.132 --> 18:19.397
- I do have to say though,
I'm not super pleased

18:19.399 --> 18:20.599
with the fact that
this class is called

18:20.734 --> 18:22.801
The Empire Strikes Baklava.

18:22.803 --> 18:25.003
- Would you have
preferred Fetacals Hall?

18:25.005 --> 18:27.071
Or I'm gonna get Moussacha?

18:27.073 --> 18:29.608
I am very good at this.

18:29.610 --> 18:31.610
- OK great, now while we're
waiting for the dolma's filling

18:31.745 --> 18:33.812
to simmer, we're gonna go
ahead and mince the garlic

18:33.814 --> 18:35.880
and chop the mint
for the lamb rub.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.950
- I feel like there's an
ice pick for the mint.

18:37.952 --> 18:38.951
- Shrivel it up.

18:38.953 --> 18:40.052
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

18:41.154 --> 18:43.155
- What are you doing?

18:43.290 --> 18:44.222
- Nothing.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.391
- Who are you What's Apping?

18:46.293 --> 18:47.892
- I'm not Mellie.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.027
- Let me see your phone.

18:49.029 --> 18:50.295
- No!

18:50.431 --> 18:51.397
- Give me your phone.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.667
Why are you What's Apping Bob?

18:55.703 --> 18:56.769
- I don't know, no reason.

18:56.771 --> 18:58.604
Just give me my phone back.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.706
- Are you fucking Bob?

19:02.443 --> 19:04.909
- Of course not.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.378
- What is this then?

19:06.380 --> 19:08.380
Why did he write, "Thinking
of you, heart heart heart?"

19:08.382 --> 19:11.249
- I don't know, because
maybe I was telling him

19:11.384 --> 19:13.251
that we've been having
some problems lately.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.387
- You told Bob our
personal business?

19:15.522 --> 19:17.522
He's our biggest client!

19:17.658 --> 19:18.991
- We were just chatting.

19:19.126 --> 19:22.461
- You were having conversations
at 2:30 in the morning?

19:22.463 --> 19:24.196
Why would you need
to be chatting then?

19:24.331 --> 19:26.098
- My God, because
she's fucking Bob!

19:27.268 --> 19:28.066
- Excuse me?

19:28.201 --> 19:29.267
- Excuse me.

19:29.403 --> 19:30.669
I don't know you.

19:30.671 --> 19:34.339
I know you and she's
obviously fucking Bob.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.742
My ex husband fucked a
Bob, so I'm like, ya know,

19:37.878 --> 19:41.079
well versed in Bob fuckers.

19:41.214 --> 19:45.550
- Honey, I promise I did
not have sex with Bob.

19:45.686 --> 19:46.751
- Yes, ya did.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.220
Yeah, ya did.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.156
And he's your
biggest client too.

19:51.158 --> 19:53.692
- OK ya know know what,
let's go, we're leaving.

19:53.827 --> 19:55.027
- Wait, I'm sorry.

19:55.162 --> 19:56.161
What's your name?

19:56.297 --> 19:57.830
- Jeff.

19:57.832 --> 20:00.298
- Jeff, that's a good name.

20:00.300 --> 20:05.270
So Jeff, that is my number
and just so you know,

20:07.908 --> 20:10.909
I'm gonna fuck the
shit outta Jeff.

20:11.044 --> 20:11.844
So...

20:17.184 --> 20:18.450
- Oh my God.

20:18.452 --> 20:19.317
Are you OK?

20:19.319 --> 20:20.985
- Yeah, yeah.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.387
I feel really good.

20:22.523 --> 20:23.555
I feel really good.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.192
- I've never been
more attracted to you

20:27.194 --> 20:30.996
than I am right now.

20:31.131 --> 20:32.331
(upbeat music)

20:32.333 --> 20:35.000
Then she gave him
her number and said

20:35.002 --> 20:38.603
she was going to fuck
the shit out of him.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.205
- OK, including the
birth of our child,

20:40.207 --> 20:41.873
is this the happiest
you've ever been?

20:42.009 --> 20:44.676
- Yes, I wanna say it's
close but it is not.

20:44.812 --> 20:47.412
- I can't even imagine
Jennifer doing that.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.747
- I know.

20:48.882 --> 20:50.015
I think this is maybe
what she needed all along,

20:50.150 --> 20:51.950
just to yell at an asshole.

20:51.952 --> 20:53.418
- You think she's actually
gonna have sex with Jeff?

20:53.553 --> 20:54.953
- I don't know, maybe.

20:54.955 --> 20:57.956
I will say I don't think
this is the first time

20:58.092 --> 21:01.160
this particular couple's
had this conversation.

21:01.162 --> 21:02.361
- But do you think it's the
first time it ever happened

21:02.496 --> 21:04.163
with their biggest client?

21:04.165 --> 21:05.364
- Oh Bob? 100%.

21:05.499 --> 21:08.099
- What kinda client
do you think Bob is?

21:08.235 --> 21:10.702
- I imagine Bob owns
commercial real estate

21:10.704 --> 21:13.372
and has a lot of sex
on filing cabinets.

21:13.374 --> 21:14.639
- I could see that.

21:14.641 --> 21:15.907
- Right?

21:15.909 --> 21:19.711
I mean ya know, you're
working such late hours

21:19.713 --> 21:24.383
around so many available,
willing women--

21:24.385 --> 21:25.984
- Uh, yeah.

21:25.986 --> 21:27.652
- It just seems to make sense.

21:27.788 --> 21:29.320
- Does it now?

21:29.322 --> 21:32.657
- I hope you don't find
this unprofessional, Bob,

21:32.659 --> 21:35.927
but I'm very happy that
we are finally alone

21:36.063 --> 21:38.998
in the office together
and what are the odds

21:39.133 --> 21:41.700
that it would happen
during a blackout?

21:42.670 --> 21:44.135
- Really?

21:44.137 --> 21:47.005
- Is now a good time or do you
need me to come back later?

21:47.008 --> 21:48.473
- Well let me check my schedule.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.075
- OK.

21:50.210 --> 21:50.942
- Yeah, I'm available.

21:51.078 --> 21:51.810
- Oh, you're available?

21:51.812 --> 21:53.812
Great, so...

21:53.947 --> 21:56.415
- You know, I've always wanted
to see you naked every since

21:56.417 --> 21:58.283
your first interview here.

21:58.285 --> 21:59.150
- Really?

21:59.152 --> 22:00.619
- Yeah.

22:00.621 --> 22:03.889
- Well, how to do you
propose we achieve that goal?

22:04.024 --> 22:06.157
- Oh, you feel that breeze?

22:06.159 --> 22:08.827
Oh my gosh.
- What happened?

22:08.829 --> 22:11.897
- The candles burned out, so--

22:11.899 --> 22:14.099
- Oh God, I can't
see anything now.

22:14.234 --> 22:17.302
- I think we should
probably just feel our way

22:17.304 --> 22:18.537
to each other now.

22:19.640 --> 22:20.772
- Oh, alright.
- What do you think?

22:20.774 --> 22:21.973
- I guess that's
our only choice.

22:21.975 --> 22:23.442
Oh, hello.

22:24.712 --> 22:26.412
You really have been
waiting a while, Bob.

22:27.715 --> 22:31.583
I feel like we gotta
make up for lost time.

22:33.921 --> 22:34.653
- That's a good idea.

22:35.723 --> 22:37.388
(alarm ringing)

22:37.390 --> 22:39.057
- What's happening?
- Shit!

22:39.060 --> 22:41.793
- [Alarm] Get up,
the house is on fire.

22:41.929 --> 22:42.994
- It's the alarm.

22:43.130 --> 22:45.497
Ah, why is it so loud?

22:47.201 --> 22:49.400
Oh my God, pull the battery out!

22:49.402 --> 22:52.071
- I'm trying.
- I hate this.

22:52.206 --> 22:53.005
- Got it.

22:55.543 --> 23:00.446
- OK, that could
not be blamed on me.

23:01.949 --> 23:06.885
I did record my voice but
I did that a few days ago.

23:08.155 --> 23:10.755
- Yeah just, I'm gonna
just need a minute here.

23:10.757 --> 23:11.557
- I get it.

23:14.427 --> 23:17.463
I know now is not
the right time but,

23:18.966 --> 23:21.867
comedy wise, this really
could not have gone better.

23:23.571 --> 23:26.205
- I'm not sure my biggest
client would agree with you.

23:27.441 --> 23:29.008
- Is your biggest
client your dick?

23:29.977 --> 23:30.909
- Mmhmm.

23:30.911 --> 23:32.111
- Got it.

23:32.113 --> 23:34.313
(jazzy music)

23:34.315 --> 23:35.380
- Mommy is amazing.

23:35.382 --> 23:36.915
I love her so much!

23:36.917 --> 23:38.183
- Must be nice to
have such cool songs

23:38.318 --> 23:39.050
written about you.

23:39.186 --> 23:40.652
- Yeah, it is.

23:40.654 --> 23:42.321
Although it just reminds me I
have nowhere to go but down.

23:42.323 --> 23:45.190
This is the most she's
ever going to love me.

23:45.192 --> 23:46.457
- Probably.

23:46.459 --> 23:48.660
- Mommy, can we get
some strawberries?

23:48.662 --> 23:49.328
- Yeah, you know where they are.

23:49.463 --> 23:50.262
Go grab em.

23:52.199 --> 23:54.599
Holy shit, that's Scott.

23:54.735 --> 23:55.667
- Who?

23:55.669 --> 23:56.401
- Scott, Jennifer's Scott.

23:56.536 --> 23:57.468
He's right there.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.004
- Oh yeah, there he is.

23:59.139 --> 24:01.606
- Ya know what, I think
this might be my moment.

24:01.608 --> 24:02.874
- Really?

24:02.876 --> 24:04.143
- Yeah, I mean how long
have I been thinking--

24:04.278 --> 24:05.811
- Andrea, Mike--

24:05.946 --> 24:07.813
- Scott, hi, how are you?

24:07.948 --> 24:09.014
- I'm good, how are you?

24:09.149 --> 24:11.016
- Good, so good!

24:11.018 --> 24:13.084
- Good, I'd love to catch
up but I'm running late

24:13.220 --> 24:14.419
to pick up the boys.

24:14.421 --> 24:15.354
- Of course, tell
them I say hello.

24:15.356 --> 24:16.487
- I will.

24:16.489 --> 24:17.489
- OK good!

24:17.491 --> 24:18.423
- OK.

24:18.425 --> 24:19.358
- OK bye!
- Bye!

24:19.360 --> 24:20.159
- So good to see you.

24:20.294 --> 24:21.694
You look great.
- Thanks.

24:24.498 --> 24:28.099
- Well, he's gonna reflect
on that for a while.

24:28.235 --> 24:28.967
- Mmhmm.

24:30.303 --> 24:32.904
Why did I say he
looked effing great?
