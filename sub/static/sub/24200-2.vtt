WEBVTT

00:02.155 --> 00:04.539
Testing, testing.

00:06.035 --> 00:08.135
Testing complete.

00:08.204 --> 00:11.238
It's 4:00 a.m.,
and I am too excited to sleep.

00:11.307 --> 00:13.744
Tomorrow is my first
official day as the boss

00:13.799 --> 00:15.533
of my new podcast company,

00:15.596 --> 00:18.330
and this right here
is our very first podcast.

00:18.366 --> 00:21.333
You might wonder why someone
with a good job,

00:21.402 --> 00:23.969
a wife, two kids, and a dancer's body

00:24.038 --> 00:25.904
would do something so risky.

00:25.973 --> 00:27.873
It's because I believe
there's a place where I can tell

00:27.942 --> 00:29.842
the kind of stories I want to tell.

00:29.877 --> 00:32.311
Where I can work with the kind
of people I want to work with.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.779
And most of all, where no one...

00:33.814 --> 00:36.048
and I mean no one...
can tell me what to do.

00:36.117 --> 00:37.549
Will you please shut up?

00:37.618 --> 00:39.752
Oh. Sorry, honey.

00:39.854 --> 00:42.187
That's the person
who was snoring earlier.

00:42.289 --> 00:43.188
Ow.

00:43.290 --> 00:46.191

00:47.862 --> 00:50.763
And now I'm pouring my coffee.

00:50.865 --> 00:52.097
Why are you wearing a purse?

00:52.199 --> 00:54.099
Oh. It's not a purse, sweetie.

00:54.201 --> 00:57.069
It's a stylish satchel that
houses my recording device.

00:57.171 --> 00:59.038
Then why is there a LUNA bar in there?

00:59.140 --> 01:01.206
They're not just for women.
They're for anybody on the go.

01:01.308 --> 01:03.609
Now, guys, this podcast about our lives

01:03.744 --> 01:05.544
only works if you ignore the microphone

01:05.646 --> 01:07.780
and just act like you'd normally act.

01:07.882 --> 01:10.349
Hello, guv'nor. I'm a British person.

01:10.451 --> 01:11.517
Or do that.

01:11.619 --> 01:13.485
Dad, I'm gonna need
some help with my costume

01:13.554 --> 01:15.020
for my wax museum project.

01:15.122 --> 01:16.221
What wax museum project?

01:16.323 --> 01:18.791
Well, everybody dresses up
like an historical figure,

01:18.893 --> 01:20.759
and then when someone
pushes your button,

01:20.828 --> 01:22.928
you say something your person
famously said.

01:22.997 --> 01:24.797
That sounds boring.
You'll be great at it.

01:24.899 --> 01:26.799
Not having Popsicles for breakfast.

01:26.901 --> 01:28.534
- You're mean.
- Yeah, I'm a monster.

01:28.636 --> 01:29.802
Listen, everybody needs to be ready

01:29.904 --> 01:31.103
to walk out that door in five.

01:31.205 --> 01:32.604
Wait,<i> you're</i> taking us?

01:32.707 --> 01:34.606
Dad, I don't love it when Mom drives.

01:34.709 --> 01:36.742
She's not great at things
like making lefts.

01:36.844 --> 01:38.944
Oh, stop it. Your mom's a great driver.

01:39.046 --> 01:41.246
And luckily for you, the drive
to school is all rights.

01:41.315 --> 01:43.148
Look, kids, I know you're used to Dad

01:43.250 --> 01:45.417
doing a lot more of these things
because at his old job,

01:45.519 --> 01:46.719
he had more flexible hours

01:46.821 --> 01:49.221
and... made good money
and had great benefits

01:49.323 --> 01:51.256
and still decided to quit
and thrust us into chaos...

01:51.358 --> 01:52.391
Come on back, baby.

01:52.493 --> 01:54.626
...which I am totally supportive of.

01:54.729 --> 01:55.961
But now that he's busier,

01:56.063 --> 01:57.563
I'm gonna be doing morning drop-off.

01:57.665 --> 01:59.665
And today, you're gonna do
pickup, too, you said.

01:59.767 --> 02:01.333
And... pickup today, too.

02:01.435 --> 02:02.668
You know what... I'm actually excited

02:02.770 --> 02:04.169
to be a little more involved.

02:04.271 --> 02:07.005
Wait, Dad. Does that mean you're
going to miss my wax museum show?

02:07.108 --> 02:10.074
- No! Of course!
- Are you still gonna read to me at night?

02:10.176 --> 02:12.644
You guys, this may be
a new chapter in my career,

02:12.747 --> 02:14.980
but nothing is going to change, okay?

02:15.082 --> 02:16.782
As the great Lee Iacocca once said

02:16.884 --> 02:19.017
in one of my many management books,

02:19.120 --> 02:21.887
"You don't turn your back on family."

02:22.823 --> 02:25.691
Or maybe that was Vin Diesel
in "Fast & The Furious 6."

02:25.793 --> 02:29.027
Irrelevant. The point is, I got this.

02:29.130 --> 02:30.896
Yeah. Hands in.

02:30.998 --> 02:32.197
Whoo! Team Schuman!

02:32.299 --> 02:33.332
- Team Schuman!
- I love you all.

02:33.434 --> 02:35.200
I love you.

02:36.637 --> 02:38.337
Forgot my purse.

02:40.141 --> 02:42.741
Good morning, all.
It's just the two of us, Al.

02:42.843 --> 02:45.144
That's my second cousin Eddie,
always giving me the business.

02:45.212 --> 02:47.379
- Say something, Ed.
- I'm a British guy.

02:47.481 --> 02:48.881
Why does everybody
make themselves British?

02:48.983 --> 02:51.550
Can I just say I love
your first-day-of-work outfit.

02:51.652 --> 02:53.485
Thank you, Deirdre Riordan,
producer, cheerleader.

02:53.587 --> 02:54.953
I would take a bullet for Alex.

02:55.055 --> 02:56.655
Okay, let's hope it
doesn't come to that.

02:56.757 --> 02:58.290
Now, I have a packed agenda for today,

02:58.392 --> 03:00.325
which begins
with an inspirational speech.

03:00.427 --> 03:02.127
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:03.724 --> 03:04.746
And go.

03:04.795 --> 03:06.973
As we venture out
on this journey together,

03:07.067 --> 03:09.334
I want us all
to be prepared for obstacles,

03:09.436 --> 03:10.936
both from the outside

03:11.005 --> 03:13.839
and also from in here... in <i> this</i> place.

03:13.941 --> 03:16.157
- Your nipple?
- He's pointing to his heart...

03:16.220 --> 03:17.391
his love muscle.

03:17.444 --> 03:19.678
Nobody's got a bigger
love muscle than Alex.

03:19.780 --> 03:22.281
Wow. You really don't hear it, do you?

03:22.349 --> 03:23.849
Continue, Alex.
I'm on the edge of my seat.

03:23.951 --> 03:26.485
That's just 'cause that chair
naturally tips forward.

03:26.587 --> 03:27.853
Yeah, why do I get the tippy chair?

03:27.955 --> 03:29.621
Because I found the Incubator.

03:29.723 --> 03:31.190
Al had the idea for the company.

03:31.258 --> 03:32.825
So far, you just bounce around here

03:32.927 --> 03:34.827
like a tiny bird on methamphetamines.

03:34.929 --> 03:36.261
You get the good chair when you score.

03:36.363 --> 03:38.297
- You know, you are a real piece of work.
- Guys, come on.

03:38.365 --> 03:39.965
You know, when I practiced
this speech at home,

03:40.034 --> 03:42.167
I held for applause, not fighting.

03:42.269 --> 03:45.404
Now my rhythm's all off.
I'm just gonna jump to the end.

03:45.506 --> 03:47.806
Uh, and in conclusion,

03:47.842 --> 03:50.342
at my old job,
it was like a dictatorship.

03:50.411 --> 03:52.311
This is going to be a democracy.

03:52.379 --> 03:55.848
So bring on your ideas.
There are no bad ones.

03:55.916 --> 03:57.749
Yes, Deirdre? And you don't need
to raise your hand.

03:57.852 --> 03:59.952
I thought it would be
cool for the podcast

04:00.020 --> 04:02.120
to weave in interviews with
successful start-up founders

04:02.189 --> 04:03.589
whose stories might relate to yours.

04:03.657 --> 04:06.191
Eddie, I said there were no bad ideas,

04:06.227 --> 04:07.826
and, actually, that's a really good one.

04:07.895 --> 04:09.494
Yeah, well,
good luck finding a major CEO

04:09.563 --> 04:10.796
who's gonna wanna talk to <i> us.</i>

04:10.865 --> 04:11.964
We just started today.

04:12.032 --> 04:13.665
I haven't even unpacked my sauces.

04:13.767 --> 04:15.167
Would you consider Jack Miller,

04:15.202 --> 04:17.469
the founder of Hoardr,
a billion-dollar start-up

04:17.538 --> 04:20.873
on the cover of this month's
<i>Wired</i> magazine a major CEO?

04:20.940 --> 04:22.774
Because he's coming in
this Wednesday at 3:00.

04:22.877 --> 04:24.443
Really?! That's amazing!

04:24.511 --> 04:26.278
Oh, my God! A hug! I don't want that!

04:26.380 --> 04:28.280
I <i> need</i> it.

04:28.382 --> 04:30.115
Wait, did you say this Wednesday?

04:30.217 --> 04:32.384
I have to to Ben's wax museum show.

04:32.453 --> 04:33.986
- Can Miller re-schedule?
- I can ask,

04:34.054 --> 04:36.088
but he is only in town for the day.

04:36.156 --> 04:37.856
You know what... maybe it's
a blessing in disguise,

04:37.958 --> 04:39.958
'cause Rooni been saying
she wants to get more involved.

04:40.027 --> 04:40.993
Now she <i> can</i> be.

04:41.061 --> 04:42.027
Let's do it.

04:42.129 --> 04:43.228
Yay! Okay.

04:43.330 --> 04:46.131
I did just a little bit of research.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.767
Wow. I guess we're working late tonight.

04:48.869 --> 04:50.749
And <i> I'll</i> be taking the good chair now.

04:51.338 --> 04:53.772
<i>They traded chairs
four more times that day.</i>

04:53.841 --> 04:56.275
<i>And when I finally got home,
Soraya had fallen asleep</i>

04:56.343 --> 04:57.342
<i>in our bedroom.</i>

05:04.485 --> 05:06.451
<i>"I forgive you. This time."</i>

05:09.623 --> 05:10.923
I missed her.

05:11.025 --> 05:13.292
Ohhh! She tried to stay up.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.793
We just... we didn't think
you'd be so late.

05:14.862 --> 05:16.762
Neither did I. My first day was crazy.

05:16.864 --> 05:18.397
I think my employees
already hate each other.

05:18.465 --> 05:21.500
Mm. Well, it was no picnic
around here, either.

05:21.568 --> 05:24.036
I got to admit,
I'm a little rusty flying solo

05:24.104 --> 05:25.337
with the whole nighttime routine.

05:25.406 --> 05:27.339
- Mm.
- The kids get really smelly.

05:27.441 --> 05:30.042
Yeah. Occasionally,
I give them a light Febreze.

05:30.110 --> 05:32.010
- Oh.
- It won't always be like this, though.

05:32.079 --> 05:33.912
Except for Wednesday.

05:33.981 --> 05:35.681
I can't come to that wax museum thing.

05:35.749 --> 05:38.183
- Really?
- Excuse me? You can't come?

05:38.218 --> 05:40.953
I'm sorry, buddy,
but what are you wearing?

05:41.021 --> 05:43.288
This is Mom's masterpiece.

05:43.357 --> 05:45.023
What is the matter with Lincoln?

05:45.092 --> 05:47.392
That's Lincoln? Like,<i> Abraham</i> Lincoln?

05:47.428 --> 05:49.594
- Yes!
- Since when do four brown socks

05:49.663 --> 05:51.263
stapled together look like a beard?

05:51.332 --> 05:53.231
They're not even matching socks.
One of them's argyle.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.100
This is why I need <i> you,</i> Dad.

05:55.202 --> 05:56.969
This isn't really Mom's thing.

05:57.037 --> 05:59.771
This whole costume
is one giant left turn.

05:59.840 --> 06:00.870
- Okay.
- You know what,

06:00.894 --> 06:03.108
since I can't come Wednesday,
I'll pick you up from school tomorrow,

06:03.177 --> 06:04.876
and I'll take you to
an awesome costume shop, okay?

06:04.979 --> 06:05.944
Sweet.

06:07.147 --> 06:08.280
Is this really that bad?

06:08.349 --> 06:10.916
You look like a tiny rabbi
who got stuck in the dryer.

06:13.420 --> 06:14.886
<i>Trying to run my business
like a democracy</i>

06:14.989 --> 06:16.621
<i>still wasn't working.</i>

06:16.724 --> 06:18.623
<i>Eddie and Deirdre were
arguing about everything...</i>

06:18.726 --> 06:19.758
...which is why I've been laying down

06:19.827 --> 06:21.426
these hot tracks in the kitchen.

06:21.528 --> 06:23.128
Excuse me. Hi.

06:23.197 --> 06:25.497
Uh, there's no podcasting
in the kitchen.

06:25.599 --> 06:27.065
Read the sign.

06:28.869 --> 06:30.402
Oh. Sorry.

06:30.471 --> 06:32.604
Okay, well, you're not in trouble.

06:32.673 --> 06:34.106
I call her The Tattler.

06:34.174 --> 06:36.008
- Al, I got to talk to you.
- Can it wait, buddy?

06:36.110 --> 06:38.744
- I have to go buy Ben a costume.
- No, this is pressing.

06:38.812 --> 06:41.313
Okay, so, I've been researching
these "podcasts."

06:41.382 --> 06:43.148
You don't have to use air
quotes. They're a real thing.

06:43.217 --> 06:45.150
Yeah, it's pretty incredible.
They got one for everything.

06:45.252 --> 06:47.386
I learned how to knit last night.

06:47.488 --> 06:48.620
Is that a potholder?

06:48.722 --> 06:50.489
Well, it's gonna be a scarf,
but for now,

06:50.591 --> 06:52.391
- it's a pocket square.
- Hmm.

06:52.459 --> 06:54.326
Anyway, through my research,
I discovered

06:54.428 --> 06:55.894
this outfit called Squarespace.

06:55.963 --> 06:57.763
Yeah, they're, like, the biggest
advertisers out there.

06:57.865 --> 07:00.265
Well, turns out, I know a guy
from the neighborhood

07:00.334 --> 07:01.700
whose daughter works there.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.902
Long story short, bippity boppity boop,

07:03.971 --> 07:05.337
we got a meeting with Squarespace.

07:05.439 --> 07:07.139
- That's incredible, Eddie!
- Yeah, yeah.

07:07.207 --> 07:09.908
Problem is, they want to meet
tomorrow afternoon at 3:00...

07:09.977 --> 07:11.777
same time as Deirdre's thingamajig.

07:11.845 --> 07:13.612
- No!
- Yeah, tough break for the kid.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.514
Not sure what you want to tell her.

07:15.616 --> 07:17.382
Tell who what?

07:17.451 --> 07:19.217
Okay, Deirdre, deep breath.

07:19.286 --> 07:21.153
Eddie got a meeting
with a big advertiser,

07:21.221 --> 07:23.055
and they can only meet
at the exact same time

07:23.123 --> 07:24.523
as your Hoardr guy.

07:24.591 --> 07:27.492
Looks like somebody's
back in the tippy chair.

07:27.561 --> 07:29.895
You are so petty! You're a petty man!

07:31.365 --> 07:32.564
I think that went pretty well.

07:35.769 --> 07:36.501
Hey, you.

07:36.603 --> 07:37.936
I didn't quit my job

07:38.038 --> 07:40.105
to be the third wheel
on the Cousin Show.

07:40.207 --> 07:41.740
You are not a third wheel, okay?

07:41.842 --> 07:43.075
And you know what, even if you were,

07:43.177 --> 07:44.543
you'd be the third wheel on a tricycle.

07:44.611 --> 07:45.744
You know what happens when you lose

07:45.846 --> 07:47.245
the third wheel of a tricycle?

07:47.347 --> 07:49.347
You become a bicycle,
and you can go much faster.

07:49.450 --> 07:50.682
You know what, forget that analogy.

07:50.784 --> 07:52.350
I just feel like advertisers invest

07:52.453 --> 07:54.252
in a good product, Alex.

07:54.354 --> 07:57.355
Our first priority
should be to make one.

07:57.458 --> 07:59.458
You're right. You're right.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.093
I'll go talk to him.

08:01.195 --> 08:02.861
I got to pick up my kids.

08:03.897 --> 08:05.530
Hey, you.

08:05.632 --> 08:07.766
I'm kind of thinking we should
reschedule Squarespace.

08:07.868 --> 08:10.769
Oh ho. This is how it's gonna be, huh?

08:10.871 --> 08:13.505
You two used to work together,
so now it's you against me.

08:13.574 --> 08:14.573
No.

08:14.675 --> 08:17.742
Al, I have real-world
business expertise.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.145
You really gonna trust
some bookworm nerd

08:20.247 --> 08:21.613
who wouldn't know a smart business move

08:21.715 --> 08:22.881
if it took her to dinner?

08:22.950 --> 08:25.884
Which it never would,
because she gets an F in boobs.

08:25.986 --> 08:28.587
I'll have you know
that they are A's, sir. A's.

08:28.689 --> 08:31.389
I'm sorry, Alex, but I cannot
work with him. I quit.

08:31.492 --> 08:32.823
Yeah, well, good luck, Tinker Bell.

08:32.926 --> 08:34.092
We're gonna miss your spunk.

08:34.193 --> 08:35.494
No, she is not quitting.

08:35.596 --> 08:37.596
Okay, then I guess <i>I'm</i> outta here.

08:37.698 --> 08:39.831
No, guys! Come on,
are you serious right now?

08:39.900 --> 08:42.567
<i>I'm</i> storming out this way.
You storm out <i> that</i> way.

08:42.669 --> 08:44.001
Deirdre!

08:47.341 --> 08:49.107
<i>Dad, you ready to go get my costume?</i>

08:49.176 --> 08:51.843
Oh, hey, buddy. I'm having a
little bit of a work emergency.

08:51.945 --> 08:53.645
<i>Dad, don't do this to me.</i>

08:53.747 --> 08:55.247
You know what, come to think of it,

08:55.349 --> 08:57.816
that Lincoln costume was pretty badass.

08:58.852 --> 09:00.418
'Sup, Schuman?

09:01.788 --> 09:02.988
Did you see that?

09:03.090 --> 09:05.837
- Was that Daniel Day-Lewis?
- I'm screwed.

09:07.736 --> 09:09.361
<i>Please don't be mad at me, babe.</i>

09:09.417 --> 09:11.087
<i>I'm dealing with a crisis.
I owe you one.</i>

09:11.111 --> 09:12.141
It's fine.

09:12.142 --> 09:13.930
A kid who got his law degree
last Wednesday

09:13.977 --> 09:16.602
is covering my case,
but I'm sure him asking,

09:16.657 --> 09:19.324
"When do I get a turn with
the gavel?" isn't a bad sign.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.260
I know this isn't your thing,
but look on the bright side.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.367
Maybe you'll have fun.

09:22.422 --> 09:24.355
Mom, there's a warlock aisle!

09:24.424 --> 09:26.590
- There's a warlock aisle?
- I got to go.

09:26.659 --> 09:28.993
Ben, honey,
you just got to pick something.

09:29.062 --> 09:30.628
We still have five more errands to run!

09:30.697 --> 09:32.399
Stop rushing me!

09:32.477 --> 09:34.276
Why is he taking so long?

09:34.345 --> 09:37.179
He's an old man
trapped in a child's body.

09:37.248 --> 09:38.914
God! I wish Dad were here.

09:38.983 --> 09:40.382
Yeah... you and me both.

09:42.086 --> 09:44.353
This is a place for joy and laughter.

09:44.422 --> 09:46.622
I know. I know it is.

09:46.691 --> 09:47.923
I'm a great mom, okay?

09:47.992 --> 09:49.492
I'm just... I'm supposed to be in court.

09:49.527 --> 09:51.193
Me too.

09:51.262 --> 09:52.995
Shhhhh.

09:53.030 --> 09:55.397
Ben, sweetheart.
You take all the time you need.

09:55.466 --> 09:57.533
We are gonna find you
the perfect costume.

09:58.731 --> 10:00.782
<i>- Gracias, señora.
- De nada.</i>

10:00.851 --> 10:03.051
Guys, neither of you can quit, okay?

10:03.120 --> 10:04.686
Is this really about the tippy chair?

10:04.788 --> 10:07.255
'Cause <i> I'll</i> take
the stupid tippy chair, okay?

10:07.357 --> 10:08.957
And P.S.... it's not even broken.

10:08.992 --> 10:10.659
All you got to do is pull
on this little lever thingy...

10:10.761 --> 10:12.327
Gaah!

10:12.396 --> 10:14.329
Okay, that chair is broken.

10:14.431 --> 10:17.165
Look, Al, with all due respect
to Little Miss Sunshine,

10:17.267 --> 10:18.433
if I give up on this,
she'll think she can

10:18.469 --> 10:20.202
always just whine her way to victory.

10:20.270 --> 10:22.437
- Oh, I haven't even <i> begun</i> to whine.
- I told you both...

10:22.506 --> 10:23.672
I want this to be the kind of place

10:23.740 --> 10:26.074
where we talk things through
and decide together.

10:26.110 --> 10:28.743
I don't want to be some
tyrannical leader like...

10:28.812 --> 10:31.552
- Napoleon!
- Napoleon! Nailed it. I'll go pay.

10:31.599 --> 10:33.900
Mom! Dad would be debating
the pros and cons

10:34.002 --> 10:35.868
of each costume with me.

10:35.937 --> 10:36.903
Okay.

10:37.005 --> 10:38.638
Uh...

10:38.740 --> 10:41.474
Pros... you look so handsome.

10:41.576 --> 10:43.476
You've tried on 67 other costumes,

10:43.511 --> 10:47.780
and, uh, Napoleon was a very
interesting historical figure.

10:47.849 --> 10:51.217
Con... Napoleon was a
megalomaniacal dictator

10:51.286 --> 10:52.885
who reintroduced slavery to Haiti.

10:54.956 --> 10:56.556
Thanks a lot, Donna.

10:56.658 --> 10:58.124
- No worries.
- Ugh! Ben!

10:58.193 --> 11:00.026
I can't do this, okay?

11:00.128 --> 11:01.494
I'm no good at it.

11:01.563 --> 11:03.896
I mean, what would your dad
be doing right now?

11:03.965 --> 11:06.499
He'd probably be telling me
who his heroes are.

11:08.470 --> 11:11.204
- Who are <i> your</i> heroes?
- Well...

11:11.306 --> 11:13.539
Okay, so, the trust falls were a bust.

11:13.608 --> 11:16.275
Let's try another round of
"When you, I feel."

11:16.344 --> 11:17.510
I'll go first.

11:17.579 --> 11:20.980
When you two fight, I feel sad.

11:21.049 --> 11:22.882
Eddie?

11:22.951 --> 11:25.385
When you talk,
I feel like you're an idiot.

11:26.354 --> 11:28.755
When you breathe,
I wish that you wouldn't.

11:28.823 --> 11:30.590
- She didn't say "feel." I win.
- He is not doing this right!

11:30.625 --> 11:32.025
- It is not a competition, you two!
- Put her out of her misery.

11:32.060 --> 11:33.326
Hey! Hi!

11:33.395 --> 11:35.428
There's no arguing in the common areas.

11:35.530 --> 11:36.929
Read the sign!

11:36.998 --> 11:38.297
W-We're sorry. We're sorry.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.766
You know what, she's right.

11:39.801 --> 11:42.135
Sometimes when my kids
are arguing, I just walk away,

11:42.203 --> 11:43.770
and they mysteriously work it out.

11:43.872 --> 11:46.172
So I'm gonna go home and read to Soraya

11:46.241 --> 11:48.174
while you two figure out who's
gonna cancel their meeting.

11:48.276 --> 11:50.810
I'll be ready for either one
in the morning. Okay?

11:52.000 --> 11:58.074

<i>"If you're reading this,
you can tell I'm asleep.</i>

12:02.624 --> 12:05.591
<i>What you can't tell is, I'm mad!"</i>

12:08.496 --> 12:10.363
I'm so sorry, baby.

12:10.432 --> 12:13.232
I'm so sorry. I'm a bad daddy.

12:13.334 --> 12:14.901
I'm so sorry.

12:19.074 --> 12:20.573
I missed her... again.

12:20.675 --> 12:22.108
Well, it's only two days.

12:22.177 --> 12:23.576
You'll have plenty of chances
to read to her.

12:23.645 --> 12:25.845
Not if I can't get Eddie
and Deirdre to work together.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.280
I thought this was gonna be a democracy,

12:27.315 --> 12:29.182
where we make big decisions together

12:29.250 --> 12:32.919
and eat lunch together
and steal Hulu together.

12:32.987 --> 12:34.554
By the way, who walks away
from a trust fall?

12:34.622 --> 12:35.588
I trusted them.

12:35.690 --> 12:36.956
Does it make it better or worse

12:37.058 --> 12:38.491
to hear that my day went really well?

12:38.560 --> 12:40.626
Oh, the costume shop.
I forgot to ask. How'd it go?

12:40.728 --> 12:42.361
- Did you find something great?
- I think so.

12:42.397 --> 12:44.263
Just, please promise me
that you'll keep an open mind.

12:44.288 --> 12:45.308
Of course.

12:45.333 --> 12:47.233
Ben, honey, come on out.

12:50.305 --> 12:52.071
Whoa.

12:52.140 --> 12:53.940
Are you going as Grandma Esther?

12:54.008 --> 12:56.242
- He's Eleanor Roosevelt!
- Ohhhh.

12:56.311 --> 12:57.710
Press my button, Dad.

12:57.812 --> 12:58.911
Okay.

13:00.281 --> 13:03.316
A woman is like a tea bag.

13:03.384 --> 13:05.685
You can't tell how strong she is

13:05.753 --> 13:08.899
until you put her in hot water.

13:09.157 --> 13:10.189
What do you think?

13:12.627 --> 13:14.460
I'm having so many thoughts.

13:14.496 --> 13:16.596
I just... I need...
I do need a quick second

13:16.664 --> 13:18.264
to focus in on one of them.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.900
Oh, darn it!
I got to go change my stockings.

13:20.935 --> 13:23.402
Can you believe
these already have a run?

13:26.941 --> 13:28.641
Do you know what the other kids
are gonna do to him?

13:28.710 --> 13:30.977
He's dressed like a woman
with a quote about tea bags.

13:31.045 --> 13:33.412
Oh, come on! He'll be fine.

13:34.415 --> 13:35.448
Right?

13:36.918 --> 13:38.317
Good morning, guys.

13:38.453 --> 13:40.219
- Did you agree on something?
- We did.

13:40.255 --> 13:41.554
We agreed that one of the two meetings

13:41.623 --> 13:42.788
was much more important than the other.

13:42.891 --> 13:44.323
I knew you two could work it out.

13:44.392 --> 13:45.725
So, which one did you decide
was more important?

13:45.827 --> 13:47.860
See, that, we did not agree on.

13:47.929 --> 13:49.695
- Wait, what?
- I couldn't do it, Alex.

13:49.731 --> 13:51.097
This meeting means
too much to the company.

13:51.166 --> 13:52.431
I refuse to let you down.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.700
I also refuse to let you down,
but more so.

13:54.769 --> 13:57.670
So, wait. They're both on their
way at the exact same time?

13:57.772 --> 13:58.777
What am I supposed to do,

13:58.840 --> 14:00.363
bounce back and forth
from meeting to meeting?

14:00.441 --> 14:01.874
Well, if you had a good enough excuse

14:01.976 --> 14:03.209
to step out for a second or two.

14:03.278 --> 14:05.611
I was being sarcastic. This is insanity.

14:05.713 --> 14:06.779
I think it could work.

14:06.848 --> 14:08.881
I'll make up a list of excuses
for you to slip out.

14:08.983 --> 14:10.950
No, no, no, no, no!

14:11.019 --> 14:12.952
I'm not gonna memorize something.

14:13.054 --> 14:14.954
I can't believe you two.

14:16.457 --> 14:20.226
You know, at Northwestern,
I dabbled a bit with the improv.

14:20.295 --> 14:22.395
I guess I'll just go with the flow

14:22.463 --> 14:24.030
and see where I get...

14:26.434 --> 14:27.466
...flowed to.

14:27.569 --> 14:29.135
Wow, amazing improv, boss.

14:29.204 --> 14:31.103
Yeah, it's pretty intuitive
once you learn the techniques.

14:31.172 --> 14:33.639
I just say the first thing
that comes to my mind.

14:33.708 --> 14:35.341
The first thing that comes to my mind.

14:35.410 --> 14:37.643
Table, chair, lamp.

14:37.745 --> 14:39.045
Uh, papers, phone.

14:40.715 --> 14:43.549
And we're projecting 100,000 listeners

14:43.618 --> 14:45.251
across all platforms,

14:45.286 --> 14:47.119
so that's something we're
really, really excited about,

14:47.188 --> 14:49.255
and we hope you'll want to be involved.

14:49.324 --> 14:51.691
Oh. Could you excuse me
just for one second?

14:51.759 --> 14:53.859
My... My wife is having
a little bit of an issue.

14:53.928 --> 14:55.494
Oh. Sure.

14:55.597 --> 14:56.896
I'll be right back.

14:56.998 --> 14:58.931
He's a little antsy
about having to wait,

14:59.033 --> 15:00.466
so turn on the charm.
I don't want him to bail.

15:00.568 --> 15:01.934
Charm set to "Stun."

15:02.003 --> 15:04.270
Mr. Miller. Sorry about that.

15:04.339 --> 15:07.039
I'm dealing with a little bit
of a childcare dilemma.

15:07.141 --> 15:09.108
Yikes. Childcare.

15:09.210 --> 15:10.910
- You know my first start-up tip?
- Mm.

15:10.979 --> 15:13.079
I think it's selfish to build
a business when you have kids.

15:13.147 --> 15:14.847
I think family makes you
worse at your job.

15:14.916 --> 15:16.215
That's why I don't have any.

15:17.952 --> 15:19.652
- Well, I...
- Neither does Alex.

15:21.322 --> 15:23.389
I thought you said you were
having a childcare dilemma.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.558
- I... I <i> am,</i> but...
- They're not his children.

15:25.627 --> 15:28.261
Deirdre, I can handle
the talking, so thank you.

15:28.329 --> 15:29.795
Whose children are they?

15:29.864 --> 15:33.099
They're not mine. Mnh-mnh.

15:33.201 --> 15:35.701
The... The children were left...

15:35.803 --> 15:36.869
on my desk...

15:38.439 --> 15:39.538
...next to my papers.

15:40.842 --> 15:44.944
Uh, excuse me while I deal
with my orphans.

15:45.913 --> 15:47.446
What are you doing? You're
supposed to wait in the room.

15:47.515 --> 15:49.282
She's trying to leave.
I ran out of small talk.

15:49.350 --> 15:50.916
We got to improv hard. Come in hot.

15:50.985 --> 15:53.052
I'm coming in hot.

15:53.154 --> 15:54.987
We are so sorry.

15:55.089 --> 15:56.722
- His wife's in the hospital.
- What?

15:56.824 --> 15:58.758
No. No, she's not.

15:58.860 --> 16:00.293
Yes, she is. You can tell them.

16:00.395 --> 16:01.427
Oh, God!

16:01.529 --> 16:04.397
It's just a tiny... bone thing.

16:04.499 --> 16:06.899
- She broke a bone?
- Well, not a <i> major</i> bone.

16:06.968 --> 16:08.467
I'd say both legs are pretty major.

16:08.569 --> 16:09.602
Eddie, what are you...

16:09.704 --> 16:11.037
Aah! Aah!

16:11.139 --> 16:14.640
Sorry. I'm so... That is...
That's my assistant with...

16:14.742 --> 16:16.275
Probably with an update on those legs.

16:16.377 --> 16:17.476
What?

16:17.578 --> 16:19.612
Why are you in the window?
I just sat down in there.

16:19.714 --> 16:21.314
He's about to walk. We are at DEFCON 10!

16:21.416 --> 16:22.415
There is no DEFCON 10!

16:22.517 --> 16:25.651
Okay, everything's okay with my wife.

16:25.753 --> 16:27.353
Your wife? I thought you said

16:27.455 --> 16:28.921
you were taking care
of some stranger's kids.

16:29.023 --> 16:29.989
I, uh...

16:30.091 --> 16:31.724
- Table! Chair! Lamp!
- What?

16:31.826 --> 16:33.592
This is not working.

16:33.695 --> 16:35.661
Mr. Miller,
I have to be honest with you.

16:35.763 --> 16:37.630
Aah!

16:37.732 --> 16:38.870
Oh, God.

16:40.701 --> 16:42.820
<i>Wait, you're telling me
your plan was to do</i>

16:42.875 --> 16:44.867
<i>the thing from "Mrs. Doubtfire"?</i>

16:44.930 --> 16:46.663
- That didn't even work in the movie.
- <i>I know.</i>

16:46.698 --> 16:49.466
<i>I should never have left those
two alone to figure it out.</i>

16:49.534 --> 16:51.668
<i>I was trying to make it home
to read to Soraya.</i>

16:51.703 --> 16:53.203
Maybe that guy Jack Miller is right.

16:53.272 --> 16:55.105
Maybe this is why
you shouldn't start a company

16:55.173 --> 16:56.906
when you're a 37-year-old dad.

16:57.009 --> 16:59.843
Hey, we're all doing stuff
we're not used to doing.

16:59.878 --> 17:03.079
<i>You know, I was sort of
resentful these past few days</i>

17:03.148 --> 17:05.415
<i>because you put all
this new stuff on my plate,</i>

17:05.517 --> 17:08.718
but I realized I was
just feeling insecure.

17:08.753 --> 17:11.186
<i>Eddie and Deirdre
are just like you and me.</i>

17:11.256 --> 17:13.556
We're all scared we're not
gonna be able to handle this,

17:13.625 --> 17:15.291
but guess what.

17:15.394 --> 17:16.492
I think we are.

17:17.896 --> 17:18.762
Check this out.

17:34.112 --> 17:35.178
Wait, he won?!

17:35.247 --> 17:37.947
<i>Yeah, I won! With Mom's idea!</i>

17:39.318 --> 17:40.917
Congrats, buddy.

17:40.986 --> 17:42.819
Show me some of the other kids.
You know... the losers.

17:42.888 --> 17:44.087
<i>Okay. Hold on.</i>

17:45.390 --> 17:47.657
<i>The only real valuable thing</i>

17:47.726 --> 17:49.459
<i>is intuition.</i>

17:49.561 --> 17:51.027
You get a car!

17:51.129 --> 17:53.063
<i>You</i> get a car! <i>You</i> get a car!

17:54.166 --> 17:55.932
<i>Aren't these costumes amazing?</i>

17:56.034 --> 17:57.133
Wait, wait. Press Ben's button.

17:57.235 --> 17:58.435
<i>Oh, yeah. Hold on one second.</i>

18:01.306 --> 18:03.506
I can't tell you how to succeed,

18:03.608 --> 18:05.608
but I <i> can</i> tell you how to fail.

18:06.945 --> 18:09.846
<i>Try to please everybody.</i>

18:13.251 --> 18:15.185
Thanks, Eleanor. I got to go.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.287
- You can book all the CEOs you want.
- Okay, this is ridiculous.

18:17.356 --> 18:19.022
- If we don't have an advertiser, we're not...
- Hey, did they leave yet?

18:19.124 --> 18:20.757
Yeah, but I think
they're still downstairs.

18:20.859 --> 18:22.726
Okay, go get them all and put
them in the conference room.

18:22.819 --> 18:24.719
I'm gonna do both meetings together.

18:24.763 --> 18:26.229
- Al, I think that ship has sailed.
- He's not gonna want to be a show pony.

18:26.298 --> 18:28.331
That's my decision!

18:28.433 --> 18:30.166
- Damn.
- Alex.

18:30.235 --> 18:32.402
Guys, sit down for a second, please.

18:36.174 --> 18:38.508
I know you think you don't have
anything in common, okay?

18:38.577 --> 18:40.210
But here's something
you <i> do</i> have in common.

18:40.278 --> 18:43.213
You both want this company to succeed.

18:43.281 --> 18:45.415
I want your passion. I-I do.

18:45.517 --> 18:47.951
I-I want you to care so much

18:48.019 --> 18:49.753
that you refuse to change your meeting.

18:49.855 --> 18:51.755
But in the end,
someone is gonna have to decide

18:51.857 --> 18:53.356
which direction we're heading.

18:53.458 --> 18:56.359
And from here on out,
that someone is gonna be me.

18:56.461 --> 18:57.961
Now, go get all those people

18:58.063 --> 19:00.430
and put them in the conference room <i> now.</i>

19:07.072 --> 19:08.271
<i>And that was how,</i>

19:08.373 --> 19:10.373
<i>with the help of a little boy
in kitten heels,</i>

19:10.442 --> 19:14.644
<i>I figured out that all I really
had to do was lead.</i>

19:14.746 --> 19:16.112
<i>Once Eddie and Deirdre understood</i>

19:16.181 --> 19:18.982
<i>that this wasn't quite
a democracy, they relaxed</i>

19:19.050 --> 19:20.950
<i>and started working together.</i>

19:21.052 --> 19:22.952
<i>The three of us were able
to show the advertisers</i>

19:23.021 --> 19:27.557
<i>and Jack Miller that this was
exactly what our show would be.</i>

19:27.592 --> 19:29.492
<i>By the end, we'd sold everyone.</i>

19:34.466 --> 19:36.065
<i>But you know what?</i>

19:36.168 --> 19:39.235
<i>That wasn't even
the best part of my day.</i>

19:50.916 --> 19:52.248
<i>"If you're reading this,</i>

19:52.350 --> 19:54.451
<i>that means you're about to be tickled!"</i>

19:54.553 --> 19:56.453
I gotcha! I gotcha!

20:00.225 --> 20:02.792
And even now, lying here,
I can't stop thinking

20:02.894 --> 20:04.594
about what Jack Miller said...

20:04.663 --> 20:07.564
about how having a family
makes you worse at your job.

20:07.666 --> 20:09.666
I wish I could tell him he's wrong.

20:09.768 --> 20:12.335
I wish I could walk up to him
and say, "Hey, Jack,

20:12.437 --> 20:14.170
you're missing out.

20:14.239 --> 20:18.274
Because today, I succeeded
not in <i> spite</i> of my family,

20:18.376 --> 20:19.676
but <i> because</i> of them."

20:19.701 --> 20:20.654
Shh!

20:20.679 --> 20:21.711
Sorry, honey.

20:23.114 --> 20:24.848
Gotta go. Bye.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.319
<i>Knit one, purl one.</i>

20:28.397 --> 20:31.507
<i>Knit one, purl two.</i>

20:31.562 --> 20:34.363
<i>Knit one, purl one.</i>

20:34.465 --> 20:38.067
<i>Knit one... you guessed it... purl two.</i>

20:38.169 --> 20:40.744
Wouldn't this be easier
to learn from YouTube?!

20:40.807 --> 20:42.206
What's YouTube?

20:42.308 --> 20:45.109
You guys! Look how amazing
this new chair is.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.011
It rolls so fast.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.313
Guys, watch. I'll get a running start.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.286
Next, we should make a onesie.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.221
For an adult or a baby?!

20:57.289 --> 20:58.222
Adult.

20:58.324 --> 20:59.555
I'm in!
