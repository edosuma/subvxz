00:00.010 --> 00:01.609
Previously on Broadchurch -

00:01.660 --> 00:03.690
I'm going into hospital - pacemaker.

00:03.740 --> 00:05.890
If anything happens,
I've made a will.

00:05.939 --> 00:08.080
Your mother had a fall.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.650
I-I'm afraid she passed away.

00:10.700 --> 00:12.700
Jonah, say something!

00:13.220 --> 00:15.170
Why can't you get me out of here?

00:15.220 --> 00:17.850
I was saying it was over,
I'd met someone else,

00:17.900 --> 00:19.330
our marriage was done.

00:19.380 --> 00:22.210
~ Why are we together?
Is it just cos Danny died?
~ No.

00:22.260 --> 00:23.530
If it is, don't bother.

00:23.580 --> 00:26.090
If this trial collapses,
it's because of you.

00:26.140 --> 00:29.890
I think I might have
something. Could be juicy.

00:29.940 --> 00:32.850
Look at that stuff. Look
at the Gillespies.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.490
Look at that bloke hanging
around the estate.

00:35.540 --> 00:40.130
~ Do your remember doing work
for Thorp Agri Services?
~ Don't think so.

00:40.180 --> 00:42.130
When I see him, I lose myself.

00:42.180 --> 00:45.890
~ I need you to move out.
I'm giving you 48 hours.
~ You can't do that.

00:48.260 --> 00:51.060
Claire Ripley showed me a photograph.

00:52.060 --> 00:54.600
She was wearing Pippa's pendant.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

01:03.100 --> 01:05.890
You go about your life
thinking you're complete,

01:05.940 --> 01:09.540
then you meet someone and realise
you're only half of something.

01:10.660 --> 01:12.730
People laugh about it.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.100
'Have you met my other half?'

01:16.460 --> 01:19.060
Then when you meet that person...

01:20.460 --> 01:22.530
.. you know it's true.

01:23.780 --> 01:27.020
You're only really whole
when you're with each other.

01:31.860 --> 01:34.060
Never ends well, does it?

01:38.180 --> 01:40.220
~ What doesn't?
~ Love.

01:41.940 --> 01:44.210
It makes you strong and...

01:44.620 --> 01:46.890
.. then it pulls you down.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.500
However it happens...

01:51.500 --> 01:53.690
.. one half always loses the other.

01:53.740 --> 01:55.690
~ It's OK.
~ No, it's not.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.370
~ It's all right.
~ No, it's not.

01:57.420 --> 01:59.360
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

02:03.220 --> 02:04.530
What's going on?

02:04.580 --> 02:06.520
Morning. Cup of tea?

02:09.940 --> 02:11.810
Claire's gone from the house.

02:11.860 --> 02:14.130
Then I found a pile
of ash in the sink,

02:14.180 --> 02:16.730
presumably from where
she burnt the photograph

02:16.780 --> 02:19.320
of herself wearing this pendant.

02:22.460 --> 02:25.810
You're saying Pippa's pendant
actually belonged to Claire?

02:25.860 --> 02:29.250
~ Well, Claire was wearing
it in the photograph I saw.
~ Tea.

02:29.300 --> 02:32.370
So she must have given
it to Pippa at some point.

02:32.420 --> 02:35.420
And now she's burnt the
photo. She's panicking.

02:36.620 --> 02:38.810
That's good. I like
it when they panic.

02:38.860 --> 02:41.490
Claire kills the girls
and Lee covers for her?

02:41.540 --> 02:43.290
What would be her motive?

02:43.340 --> 02:46.410
Unless she was grooming
Pippa for Lee.

02:46.460 --> 02:49.010
I knew I'd seen this name
before - Gary Thorp.

02:49.060 --> 02:52.170
He runs that incinerator business
- Thorp Agri Services.

02:52.220 --> 02:55.810
He was on the invite list to the
wedding Ricky and Kate went to.

02:55.860 --> 02:57.370
RSVP'd yes, didn't turn up.

02:57.420 --> 03:00.410
Does he know Ricky and Kate?
We haven't talked to him?

03:00.460 --> 03:03.690
There was no connection until
now. I'll get on to it.

03:03.740 --> 03:05.850
It doesn't mean we'll
reopen the case.

03:05.900 --> 03:07.410
What are you two gonna do?

03:07.460 --> 03:10.610
Miller is gonna give Claire
one last chance to confess.

03:10.660 --> 03:12.050
~ Am I?
~ Aye, you are.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.700
We're gonna set a fire under her.

03:16.540 --> 03:18.050
Hello?

03:18.100 --> 03:20.370
Hi, it's me. Where are you?

03:26.620 --> 03:27.890
Like you care.

03:27.940 --> 03:30.530
I saw the photograph, Claire.

03:30.580 --> 03:33.930
Why were you wearing a pendant
belonging to Pippa Gillespie?

03:33.980 --> 03:35.850
It wasn't Pippa's.

03:41.060 --> 03:42.660
It was mine.

03:43.540 --> 03:45.610
My gran gave it to me.

03:46.340 --> 03:49.980
Why did Pippa Gillespie have it?
Why did you burn the photograph?

03:52.580 --> 03:53.890
Do you know, I am...

03:53.940 --> 03:57.410
I am sick and tired of my life
being defined by this, Ellie.

03:57.460 --> 04:01.010
I keep being dragged into something
I had nothing to do with.

04:01.060 --> 04:04.180
Why do you still keep
secrets from us?

04:05.820 --> 04:09.490
~ The truth doesn't help.
~ It gives peace to the families involved.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.140
You think so?

04:11.740 --> 04:17.380
Your friends, the parents of
that boy your husband killed...

04:19.060 --> 04:21.260
.. are they at peace now?

04:24.300 --> 04:26.370
No, I didn't think so.

04:26.820 --> 04:30.050
OK, Lisa Newbury - we need to
know if she's dead or alive,

04:30.100 --> 04:32.570
if there's a body to be found.

04:33.980 --> 04:37.490
I had a life, Ellie, and it
was destroyed in the ripples.

04:37.540 --> 04:39.880
They just keep coming at me.

04:42.140 --> 04:44.410
When is it ever gonna stop?

04:53.820 --> 04:56.360
~ Where's Claire?
~ Don't you know?

04:56.900 --> 05:00.300
~ She's left the cottage.
~ What did she do that for?

05:01.180 --> 05:04.180
~ Anyway, I came to say thank you.
~ For what?

05:05.220 --> 05:06.970
South Mercia Constabulary

05:07.020 --> 05:10.370
have authorised the Sandbrook
investigation to be re-opened.

05:10.420 --> 05:12.530
New leads, new evidence.

05:12.580 --> 05:16.050
Couldn't have it without you,
that information you gave me.

05:16.100 --> 05:18.450
Not gonna take long
to wrap it up now.

05:18.500 --> 05:21.730
Are you all right? There's
something different about you.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.770
I'm more than all right, Lee.

05:23.820 --> 05:25.890
I'm reborn.

05:25.940 --> 05:28.090
What?

05:28.140 --> 05:30.050
I thought this case would kill me.

05:30.100 --> 05:33.420
I thought I would die not
knowing, having failed.

05:35.060 --> 05:37.200
Then I had my operation.

05:37.940 --> 05:40.210
After it, when I woke up...

05:41.380 --> 05:44.380
.. and I was alive, and I
didn't expect to be alive...

05:45.380 --> 05:47.850
.. know the first thing I felt?

05:49.420 --> 05:50.650
What?

05:50.700 --> 05:51.970
Angry.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.440
Really, properly angry.

05:55.900 --> 05:58.840
For the Gillespies,
for Pippa, for Lisa.

05:59.900 --> 06:04.250
I hadn't felt that angry in years.
That is a beautiful feeling. I was...

06:04.300 --> 06:07.300
I was worn down, I was
tired, I was beaten.

06:08.420 --> 06:11.020
Now I've got a new lease of life.

06:11.900 --> 06:15.130
Whereas you, of course, look
at you - you're exhausted.

06:15.180 --> 06:16.920
Sick of running.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.050
Sick of not being able
to escape what happened.

06:21.100 --> 06:25.130
~ I get that.
~ You don't get anything about me.

06:25.180 --> 06:27.120
What I don't get...

06:28.100 --> 06:31.620
.. is whether you're lying to protect
yourself or someone else.

06:33.340 --> 06:35.210
Presumably Claire.

06:35.460 --> 06:38.460
I'd always thought she
was lying to protect you.

06:39.860 --> 06:42.330
Maybe it's the other way round.

06:45.260 --> 06:47.200
You can't trust her.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.840
~ You're wrong.
~ Am I?

06:53.700 --> 06:56.250
She ever tell you she was pregnant?

06:56.300 --> 06:57.570
When?

06:58.420 --> 07:02.490
Judging by the dates - before the
night Lisa and Pippa went missing -

07:02.540 --> 07:06.620
~ so all the time you were in custody.
~ You're lying.

07:07.620 --> 07:09.020
Ask her.

07:12.420 --> 07:14.560
So what happened to it?

07:15.740 --> 07:18.810
~ It's OK.
~ No, it's -
~ It's all right.
~ No, it's not.

07:18.860 --> 07:20.800
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

07:22.460 --> 07:25.060
If he ever finds out about this...

07:27.100 --> 07:29.170
Why don't you ask her?

07:53.740 --> 07:56.010
Hurry up. Last day of evidence.

07:56.060 --> 07:57.930
Should I move out?

08:02.580 --> 08:05.580
Oh... Do you want to?
Where would you go?

08:06.020 --> 08:07.620
I don't know.

08:08.620 --> 08:11.930
I didn't say, 'Leave,' I said,
'I need you to change.'

08:11.980 --> 08:13.250
Yeah, what if I can't?

08:13.300 --> 08:16.370
Stop thinking of life as something
that happens to you.

08:16.420 --> 08:20.090
~ What we do now, that's who we are.
~ You said you didn't need me.

08:20.140 --> 08:22.810
I said I can be alone if I have to.

08:23.380 --> 08:26.740
You need to decide if we matter
enough for you to change.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.289
Mark and Beth...

08:42.380 --> 08:46.890
Ms Bishop, I believe you
have an application to make.

08:46.940 --> 08:51.090
The defence wishes to recall former
Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller

08:51.140 --> 08:52.930
as a witness for the defence.

08:52.980 --> 08:58.540
My Lady, I apply to treat DS
Miller as a hostile witness.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.370
How close are you to your sister?

09:04.420 --> 09:05.730
Lucy? Pretty close.

09:05.780 --> 09:08.410
We have our disagreements,
you know, family.

09:08.460 --> 09:11.810
At the end of the investigation
into Danny Latimer's death,

09:11.860 --> 09:15.340
were you aware she'd racked
up substantial gambling debts?

09:16.900 --> 09:20.200
~ I became aware, yeah.
~ How did you become aware?

09:20.700 --> 09:22.530
Lucy told me she was in trouble.

09:22.580 --> 09:26.570
~ Did she ask for help with the debts?
~ She did, I refused.

09:26.620 --> 09:30.690
On the day that your husband,
the defendant, was arrested,

09:30.740 --> 09:32.050
you wrote a cheque

09:32.100 --> 09:36.930
from the joint-account you hold
with your husband for Â£1,000,

09:36.980 --> 09:38.650
made payable to your sister.

09:38.700 --> 09:40.440
Is that correct?

09:45.820 --> 09:49.220
What made you change your
mind about helping her?

09:50.100 --> 09:51.130
I don't know.

09:51.180 --> 09:56.290
You don't know why you suddenly
gave your sister Â£1,000?

09:56.340 --> 09:58.780
She was desperate.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.420
It was YOU that was
desperate, wasn't it?

10:04.660 --> 10:08.010
Later that day, according
to your police notebook,

10:08.060 --> 10:12.290
you told DI Hardy that your
sister had given a statement

10:12.340 --> 10:13.890
describing a man

10:13.940 --> 10:19.570
conveniently matching the
description of the defendant

10:19.620 --> 10:23.210
dumping clothes into a bin
the night of Danny's death.

10:23.260 --> 10:25.770
Did you bribe your sister

10:25.820 --> 10:29.850
~ to fabricate evidence against your husband?
~ No, I didn't.

10:29.900 --> 10:33.050
You bribed a witness to
implicate your husband

10:33.100 --> 10:36.690
so that you could fix
a failing investigation

10:36.740 --> 10:38.930
and continue your affair
with DI Hardy.

10:38.980 --> 10:41.850
~ Isn't that true?
~ Not a single word of this is true!

10:41.900 --> 10:44.730
~ I lent her money to help -
~ Not 'lent', 'bribed'!

10:44.780 --> 10:48.490
On the condition that she
help you frame your husband.

10:48.540 --> 10:52.330
Nobody framed Joe. He killed
Danny, he confessed.

10:52.380 --> 10:55.570
~ After you beat him up, or before?
~ Don't listen to her!

10:55.620 --> 10:59.570
Everybody knows he killed Danny and
I wish I'd been able to stop him!

10:59.620 --> 11:04.300
Don't lecture the jury, PC Miller.
Your job is to answer the question.

11:05.940 --> 11:08.340
No further questions, m'lady.

11:09.420 --> 11:12.360
That concludes the
case for the defence.

11:35.420 --> 11:37.210
~ No, no, Miller back in the car.
~ What?

11:37.260 --> 11:40.090
You boys are going to your Aunt
Lucy's - sleepover, it'll be fun.

11:40.140 --> 11:43.690
~ What's he talking about?
~ I've no idea. You're not going to Lucy's.

11:43.740 --> 11:45.930
I've arranged it. We've
got work to do.

11:45.980 --> 11:48.920
We'll drop you there
now. How was court?

11:53.700 --> 11:55.810
~ You bribed your sister?!
~ I did not!

11:55.860 --> 11:59.090
I lent her money, she made
a statement - separate things!

11:59.140 --> 12:02.770
~ Can you not see how that
could get put together?
~ I make mistakes.

12:02.820 --> 12:06.370
But I didn't kill a child! They
were gonna shut the case down.

12:06.420 --> 12:10.010
She knew something, but needed
money. I did not know it was Joe!

12:10.060 --> 12:11.570
That's all right, then (!)

12:11.620 --> 12:15.330
It's gonna be all right, they've
got enough evidence, haven't they?

12:15.380 --> 12:18.130
It could go either way.
Juries are funny animals.

12:18.180 --> 12:21.570
Would it kill you to be reassuring?
You are terrible company!

12:21.620 --> 12:23.570
Why are we going back here, anyway?

12:23.620 --> 12:26.690
Tess has found Gary Thorp.
I really wanna talk to him.

12:26.740 --> 12:28.450
Gary Thorp?

12:28.500 --> 12:30.440
South Mercia Police.

12:32.060 --> 12:36.770
Are you the same Gary Thorp
who owns Thorp Agri Services?

12:36.820 --> 12:40.370
Used to. It was my dad's business.
When he died, I took it over.

12:40.420 --> 12:43.490
Went bankrupt. What's this about?

12:43.540 --> 12:46.330
Did Kate Gillespie do
your business accounts?

12:46.380 --> 12:48.490
Not to my knowledge.

12:48.540 --> 12:51.170
Have you ever met Kate,
or her husband, Ricky?

12:51.220 --> 12:53.890
Once. He met lent me cash
when I was in trouble.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.480
Money came from his niece, Lisa.

12:57.140 --> 12:59.340
So you know Lisa Newbury?

13:00.500 --> 13:02.970
We went out a couple of times.

13:04.460 --> 13:06.600
~ Was it serious?
~ I wish!

13:07.620 --> 13:08.890
Uh...

13:10.020 --> 13:12.050
I fell for her, big time.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.970
I thought she was the one,

13:15.020 --> 13:17.890
and she didn't feel
the same about me.

13:19.020 --> 13:22.520
Why didn't you come forward
when Lisa disappeared?

13:23.460 --> 13:25.530
I wasn't in any state.

13:25.820 --> 13:27.220
Why not?

13:31.820 --> 13:35.490
The business was in a state cos
I wasn't paying to attention to it

13:35.540 --> 13:39.040
~ and my life went out of control.
~ What do you mean?

13:41.220 --> 13:43.820
I used to follow her a little bit.

13:47.180 --> 13:49.890
Stand outside where she
was. I'm not proud of it.

13:49.940 --> 13:51.730
Like when she was babysitting?

13:51.780 --> 13:55.420
Did you stand outside the Gillespies'
house when she was there?

13:58.540 --> 14:02.040
Where were you on the night
the girls disappeared?

14:03.660 --> 14:05.260
In hospital.

14:06.460 --> 14:08.600
I tried to kill myself.

14:15.380 --> 14:16.770
So what are you here for?

14:16.820 --> 14:20.450
~ Did you ever give money to Gary Thorp?
~ Never heard of him.

14:20.500 --> 14:24.330
He went out with Lisa, got a business
called Thorp Agri Services.

14:24.380 --> 14:26.530
Yes... Yeah, I did
give him some cash.

14:26.580 --> 14:30.290
Lisa asked for some help, said
he had a cash flow problem,

14:30.340 --> 14:31.530
that I'd get it back.

14:31.580 --> 14:36.050
~ Why didn't you tell us at the time?
~ Uh, cos it didn't seem important

14:36.100 --> 14:38.100
and it never came up.

14:40.020 --> 14:43.140
Did you knew he ran an animal
incineration business?

14:44.820 --> 14:47.820
Jesus. Do you think he had
something to do with it?

14:51.820 --> 14:54.490
How long have you had this picture?

14:57.580 --> 14:59.180
A year, two.

14:59.660 --> 15:01.820
You like bluebells?

15:03.300 --> 15:05.260
Uh...

15:06.900 --> 15:09.570
Yeah, yeah. They're all
right. They're a...

15:09.620 --> 15:12.360
They're a flower, aren't they? So...

15:22.140 --> 15:25.340
~ Well, thank you very much for your time.
~ Yeah.

15:29.380 --> 15:32.940
You still got the number
you found in Claire's phone?

15:34.060 --> 15:35.800
~ Yeah.
~ Ring it.

16:30.780 --> 16:34.180
No-one followed you, did they?
They don't know I'm here.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.420
When were you gonna tell me?!

17:05.020 --> 17:07.619
~ I don't know...
~ You don't know?!

17:08.740 --> 17:10.140
I swear!

17:15.740 --> 17:18.690
I don't know... Get
off me. Get off me!

17:18.740 --> 17:21.210
~ You were pregnant!
~ Get off me.

17:21.260 --> 17:23.130
Get off me!

17:23.180 --> 17:27.250
I wasn't ready to tell you,
and then you were arrested.

17:27.300 --> 17:30.130
I didn't know what was gonna happen.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.610
I was so scared!

17:31.660 --> 17:33.400
I was so scared.

17:34.580 --> 17:36.850
What happened to the baby?

17:38.420 --> 17:39.610
I had an abo...

17:39.660 --> 17:41.700
I had an abortion.

17:45.820 --> 17:49.930
~ How did Alec Hardy know about this?
~ Alec? Alec? He told you?

17:49.980 --> 17:53.530
~ How did he know?
~ He came to the clinic with me.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.980
He stayed with me.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.450
Was the baby mine?

18:05.620 --> 18:09.050
~ Was the baby mine?!
~ You have to ask me that?

18:09.100 --> 18:12.890
You have to ask me that,
after all I've done for you?

18:22.820 --> 18:25.020
I don't want you near me.

18:32.900 --> 18:36.010
I need three doubters on the
jury - who am I aiming for?

18:36.060 --> 18:39.970
No 0.6 did not like Hardy - she kept
shaking her head without realising.

18:40.020 --> 18:43.410
This bloke kept fidgeting every
time Jocelyn was on her feet,

18:43.460 --> 18:46.730
like he wasn't interested. That
one laughed at your jokes.

18:46.780 --> 18:50.530
This one's very pro you - sits up
and smiles every time you speak.

18:50.580 --> 18:54.130
~ Quite right.
~ This one is not impressed
with the police evidence.

18:54.180 --> 18:57.410
~ A lot of work to get her onside.
~ I don't care about them.

18:57.460 --> 19:00.970
As long as we've got three, they
can't get a unanimous verdict,

19:01.020 --> 19:02.490
or a majority.

19:02.540 --> 19:06.540
How did you know to look at
their joint bank statements?

19:08.500 --> 19:10.300
Oh, right. Erm...

19:11.500 --> 19:14.930
~ You know the boy who works
at the local newspaper?
~ Mm.

19:14.980 --> 19:16.410
Ellie Miller's nephew.

19:16.460 --> 19:19.050
~ Possibly shagged him.
~ No!

19:19.100 --> 19:21.770
Bloody hell!

19:21.820 --> 19:26.100
I hope you gave him a good time!

19:28.060 --> 19:30.660
Jocelyn, I'm sorry about your mum.

19:32.900 --> 19:36.380
~ We're working now, Ben.
~ All the same...

19:37.580 --> 19:40.740
Compartments - that's how
we survive in this world.

20:27.420 --> 20:29.810
What do we know about the defendant?

20:29.860 --> 20:31.690
We know he had a violent temper.

20:31.740 --> 20:35.410
We know he was in secret
communication with Danny.

20:35.460 --> 20:38.460
We know he was secretly
meeting Danny.

20:39.660 --> 20:42.490
We know the defendant has
not been able to give us

20:42.540 --> 20:47.050
a satisfactory explanation as
to why he had Danny's phone.

20:47.100 --> 20:50.890
Or why he gave Danny Â£500 in cash.

20:50.940 --> 20:54.940
We know forensics have placed
him at the murder scene.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.410
You've heard sworn evidence

20:58.460 --> 21:01.690
that Joe Miller was seen
dumping clothes that night.

21:01.740 --> 21:04.250
You have not heard any alibi evidence

21:04.300 --> 21:07.850
to place him anywhere else other
than at the murder scene.

21:07.900 --> 21:13.860
And yet the one person we haven't
heard from is the defendant himself.

21:19.780 --> 21:23.050
It's a short walk from the
dock to the witness box -

21:23.100 --> 21:25.450
I've counted it to be 13 steps.

21:25.500 --> 21:29.610
You may think that if you're falsely
accused of a child's murder,

21:29.660 --> 21:31.650
you'd make that short walk.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.850
You may even think you'd run there

21:33.900 --> 21:36.090
to reassure the jury
of your innocence.

21:36.140 --> 21:40.210
But when given the opportunity to
give his own account and explanation

21:40.260 --> 21:42.450
of the evidence against him,

21:42.500 --> 21:45.250
when given a chance to
protest his innocence,

21:45.300 --> 21:47.840
to shout it from the rooftops...

21:48.380 --> 21:50.860
.. he chooses to stay silent.

21:52.380 --> 21:54.890
Instead, he allows his
lawyers to speculate,

21:54.940 --> 21:57.050
to throw red herrings around

21:57.100 --> 21:59.530
to try and distract
you from the truth.

21:59.580 --> 22:03.810
You may conclude that the reason
for all these distortions,

22:03.860 --> 22:09.130
and the reason the defendant has
not got into that witness box

22:09.180 --> 22:14.130
is because he knows, he knows
he can't defend himself.

22:14.180 --> 22:17.090
He's preferred to hide
behind the glass,

22:17.140 --> 22:19.490
to hide behind the fabricated stories

22:19.540 --> 22:22.640
his lawyers are fighting
to convince you of.

22:23.580 --> 22:26.330
In a moment, you're going
to hear from Ms Bishop,

22:26.380 --> 22:29.860
who's going to make many
ludicrous suggestions.

22:31.020 --> 22:36.690
It's up to you, members of the jury,
how seriously you take these.

22:36.740 --> 22:42.650
But the Crown's case is that you can
be sure of the defendant's guilt.

22:42.700 --> 22:46.700
You can be sure Joe Miller...

22:47.700 --> 22:49.970
.. murdered Daniel Latimer.

22:55.780 --> 22:58.650
I always loved watching
your speeches.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.690
Thank you.

23:02.740 --> 23:04.740
Good luck with yours.

23:08.380 --> 23:11.060
My boy can't appeal his sentence.

23:12.700 --> 23:14.290
So...

23:14.340 --> 23:17.140
you and your shitty justice system...

23:19.140 --> 23:21.280
.. can both go to hell.

23:24.340 --> 23:27.330
The Crown needs you to be sure.

23:27.380 --> 23:30.050
They've given you
a version of events,

23:30.100 --> 23:34.970
but there's a compelling alternative
version of what happened that night.

23:35.020 --> 23:40.450
It's not in any dispute
that Danny's father, Mark,

23:40.500 --> 23:44.660
was 50 yards away from
the murder scene.

23:46.940 --> 23:49.620
Let's stop and think about that.

23:51.500 --> 23:55.250
Mark Latimer had just
engaged in illicit sex

23:55.300 --> 23:57.370
with a new-found mistress

23:57.420 --> 23:59.530
that had a profound effect on him.

23:59.580 --> 24:02.530
Because, according
to his own evidence,

24:02.580 --> 24:04.410
he composed a letter to his wife

24:04.460 --> 24:09.740
telling her the marriage was over,
that he had found his new soul-mate.

24:10.900 --> 24:14.770
He interpreted a fumble in a car

24:14.820 --> 24:16.940
as true love.

24:20.220 --> 24:24.450
Now let's remember that there was
a window in the hut where Danny was,

24:24.500 --> 24:27.980
which had a direct
view onto the carpark.

24:29.580 --> 24:33.250
Let's say that Danny saw his
dad with his new mistress.

24:33.300 --> 24:37.180
Let's say that he ran from the
hut and confronted his dad.

24:38.700 --> 24:41.530
As soon as his face popped
up at that car window,

24:41.580 --> 24:43.810
Mark's dream,

24:43.860 --> 24:49.490
Mark's absurd schoolboy
fantasy was in pieces.

24:49.540 --> 24:52.770
He was jolted back to the real world.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.090
Just picture it.

24:54.140 --> 24:57.650
Danny's gonna run to his
mum, tell her everything.

24:57.700 --> 25:03.330
Mark has a tiny window of
opportunity to stop him,

25:03.380 --> 25:04.730
to explain,

25:04.780 --> 25:09.260
to reassure and persuade
him not to tell.

25:10.620 --> 25:14.330
Now let's imagine Danny
tried to break free,

25:14.380 --> 25:15.770
ran back to the hut.

25:15.820 --> 25:17.010
Mark follows him.

25:17.060 --> 25:18.570
There's an altercation.

25:18.620 --> 25:22.850
And in the ensuing
tragedy and confusion,

25:22.900 --> 25:26.220
Mark ends up killing Danny.

25:30.620 --> 25:33.860
Can you be sure that didn't happen?

25:35.140 --> 25:39.450
You also heard evidence
that Nigel Carter was seen

25:39.500 --> 25:42.140
dumping Danny's body that night.

25:43.580 --> 25:47.610
Can you be sure that
Mark did not kill Danny

25:47.660 --> 25:53.340
and call his workmate and best friend
to help him out of a crisis?

25:54.540 --> 25:58.530
You may also feel that
the police investigation

25:58.580 --> 26:00.850
was fundamentally flawed.

26:00.900 --> 26:05.940
Procedures compromised, personal liaisons
got in the way of the truth.

26:09.860 --> 26:13.250
Now it is an undoubted tragedy

26:13.300 --> 26:16.380
that a young boy was murdered.

26:17.740 --> 26:21.570
But it's my job to represent
the defendant.

26:21.620 --> 26:27.290
And it's my contention that
it's impossible to be sure

26:27.340 --> 26:30.780
that this man is guilty.

26:33.980 --> 26:38.730
There's only one candidate
on trial here - the defendant.

26:38.780 --> 26:43.700
The prosecution have to prove their
case against this defendant.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.890
You have to be satisfied

26:46.940 --> 26:49.940
that you are sure of
the defendant's guilt.

26:50.780 --> 26:55.170
The defence, as part of their case,
have offered you an alternative.

26:55.220 --> 26:58.530
If you think what the
defence says is true,

26:58.580 --> 27:01.050
or may possibly be true,

27:01.100 --> 27:06.100
then the prosecution have failed in
proving the guilt of the defendant.

27:07.900 --> 27:11.260
There's no burden on the
defence to prove anything.

27:12.260 --> 27:16.570
There's no obligation on the
defendant to give evidence.

27:16.620 --> 27:19.970
Now, you may draw
your own conclusions

27:20.020 --> 27:23.450
as to why the defendant has
chosen not to give evidence,

27:23.500 --> 27:28.850
but bear in mind he will have obtained
legal advice on the matter.

27:28.900 --> 27:32.060
You are the judges of fact.

27:33.500 --> 27:35.410
You must put aside any emotion

27:35.460 --> 27:39.010
and approach this in
a cold, analytical way.

27:39.060 --> 27:42.340
Consider and assess all of
the evidence that you've heard

27:43.620 --> 27:46.690
The first thing you need to
do is appoint a foreperson.

27:46.740 --> 27:49.450
And if you need to be reminded
of any evidence,

27:49.500 --> 27:52.460
just pass a note via
the jury bailiff.

27:53.580 --> 27:55.930
You will now be escorted
to a private room

27:55.980 --> 27:58.920
to begin your
deliberations. Thank you.

28:21.040 --> 28:22.910
How are you doing?

28:24.040 --> 28:25.830
You have to rise above it, Dad.

28:25.880 --> 28:30.590
The judge has let the jury go today.
They'll be reconvening tomorrow.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.110
How long will it take?

28:32.160 --> 28:35.470
It could be done within an hour
tomorrow, could be a week,

28:35.520 --> 28:37.030
it's impossible to predict.

28:37.080 --> 28:40.350
Do we have to come in tomorrow
if they're still discussing?

28:40.400 --> 28:43.830
No, but if they reach a verdict,
they'll read it immediately.

28:43.880 --> 28:46.750
~ We have to sit and wait?
~ Yeah.
~ Whole system stinks.

28:46.800 --> 28:50.520
~ I know it can't have been
easy for you in there.
~ You have no idea.

28:54.560 --> 28:58.480
~ Tell me they're going to come
back with the right verdict.
~ I hope so.

28:59.560 --> 29:02.070
I don't know what I've
done to deserve this.

29:02.120 --> 29:05.240
It's a thank you for pulling
me back into the world.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.430
Have I done that?

29:07.480 --> 29:09.350
You know you have.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.460
There's something else.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.790
Something I should have told you...

29:19.840 --> 29:21.580
long before now.

29:23.400 --> 29:27.230
There was a moment, must
have been 15 years ago.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.280
I should have said
it then, and I didn't.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.680
And I want to say it now.

29:36.120 --> 29:38.120
It's always been you.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.080
~ What has?
~ You're gonna make me say it, aren't you?

29:43.760 --> 29:45.030
Fine.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.470
I'm in love with you, Maggie.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.670
Ever since you came here.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.660
What am I supposed
to do with that now?

29:57.160 --> 29:59.760
Do you really think I didn't know?

30:00.240 --> 30:03.920
~ Well, why didn't you say anything?
~ Because you never did!

30:05.200 --> 30:09.830
I thought if you really
feel that strongly,

30:09.880 --> 30:11.390
you'd be brave,

30:11.440 --> 30:14.310
you wouldn't care
what people thought.

30:16.040 --> 30:19.640
~ But your work mattered more.
~ I thought it did.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.000
But I was wrong.

30:25.840 --> 30:27.510
Say something.

30:28.360 --> 30:31.910
Jocelyn, you're grieving,
you're feeling alone,

30:31.960 --> 30:34.430
that's why you're saying this.

30:36.240 --> 30:39.080
But it's over. The moment passed.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.590
No.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.640
I don't think it has.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.340
~ Are you OK?
~ Mm-hm.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.510
Just... got into a bit of a scrap.

31:17.560 --> 31:20.030
You should see the other girl.

31:22.480 --> 31:25.280
Have you reported this to the police?

31:26.400 --> 31:28.680
What's so funny about that?

31:30.440 --> 31:33.040
I think I need a bit of sanctuary.

31:41.440 --> 31:45.350
I've got some antiseptic wipes - I
can have a look at the eye for you.

31:45.400 --> 31:46.870
Thank you.

31:46.920 --> 31:50.620
It was my husband - he found
out I'd had an abortion.

31:52.680 --> 31:56.080
~ Has he been violent with you before?
~ Not really.

31:58.120 --> 32:01.590
~ Do you live locally?
~ Don't really live anywhere at the moment.

32:01.640 --> 32:04.030
I can recommend a women's
refuge for you.

32:04.080 --> 32:07.310
~ I can drive you there, if need be.
~ No, it's not like that.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.630
~ It looks very much like that.
~ No, it's not.

32:10.680 --> 32:13.840
It really is not. It's
more complicated.

32:15.750 --> 32:16.750
And I'm...

32:16.800 --> 32:20.200
I'm all out of places to
run, that's the problem.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.800
What am I supposed to do?

32:28.520 --> 32:32.550
I was in trouble once.
I was living rough.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.270
I'd sort of...

32:34.680 --> 32:37.790
~ .. hit rock bottom.
~ What did you do?

32:37.840 --> 32:41.910
I stopped, turned around and faced
the demons I'd been avoiding.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.960
There was no other way
to go, so I fought back.

32:48.440 --> 32:52.840
'When I am weak, then I am strong.'

33:01.600 --> 33:04.830
Recurring suspects - what were
they doing in the 12 hours

33:04.880 --> 33:06.910
before Lisa and Pippa went missing?

33:06.960 --> 33:08.310
Uh... Right.

33:08.360 --> 33:11.830
Claire... left work at four o'clock

33:11.880 --> 33:14.790
and she went to do Kate's hair...

33:14.840 --> 33:15.830
~ It's there.
~ Oh.

33:15.880 --> 33:18.030
.. for the wedding party that night.

33:18.080 --> 33:22.790
Ricky - he got home at 4:45,

33:22.840 --> 33:26.470
having spent the afternoon at a
building site doing foundations.

33:26.520 --> 33:30.310
Lee finished a job that morning putting
in flooring in a church hall

33:30.360 --> 33:33.830
then went to buy stock - we've
got him on CCTV in the carpark,

33:33.880 --> 33:36.910
a receipt timed at 14:27,
so that tallies.

33:36.960 --> 33:40.390
Claire and Kate remember hearing
him working on his own floor

33:40.440 --> 33:42.350
when Claire was doing Kate's hair.

33:42.400 --> 33:44.710
~ When was that taken?
~ About a week before.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.070
That leaves Gary Thorp,

33:46.120 --> 33:49.390
who says he spent all day and
most of the evening at work -

33:49.440 --> 33:52.910
the place was on a 7 day, 24 hour
activity during that period.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.750
The furnace was alight all
weekend? Who else knew?

33:55.800 --> 33:59.590
What bothers me is when I asked about
Thorp Agri Services, he lied.

33:59.640 --> 34:02.230
He said maybe it was
connected to Kate.

34:02.280 --> 34:05.390
He'd heard that name before,
knew it was connected. How?

34:05.440 --> 34:08.949
Gary Thorp is a credible suspect
if he was stalking Lisa.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.550
How does Lee Ashworth know that?
We only know cos Thorp told us.

34:12.600 --> 34:17.080
~ Ashworth would have no reason to know.
~ Unless Lisa told him.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.389
Exactly.

34:19.440 --> 34:22.949
Miller, there it is - that's
the lie. That's the wee lie.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.230
He wanted me to think he'd heard
about Thorp through Kate,

34:26.280 --> 34:28.110
but what if it was through Lisa?

34:28.159 --> 34:32.070
If that's the case, Lee must have
known her better that he's admitted.

34:32.120 --> 34:33.659
Mustn't he!

34:47.159 --> 34:48.550
What did that text mean?

34:48.600 --> 34:51.510
~ I've got something wrong?
~ Thought you'd come round.

34:51.560 --> 34:54.150
~ Spoken to Claire yet?
~ What do you want?

34:54.199 --> 34:56.510
~ Did you ever sleep with Lisa Newbury?
~ No.

34:56.560 --> 34:57.870
~ Did you want to?
~ No.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.630
~ She turn you down?
~ No.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.870
What did Claire make of you and Lisa?

35:01.920 --> 35:03.990
There was no 'me and Lisa'.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.670
~ I barely even spoke to her.
~ Right.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.660
Just slept with her?

35:11.320 --> 35:14.060
What's it like to kill someone, Lee?

35:14.800 --> 35:18.480
What's it like to be in the room
when the life goes out a person?

35:19.840 --> 35:22.940
How does it feel to be
responsible for that?

35:24.280 --> 35:26.350
I told you, I don't know.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.440
I think you do.

35:30.520 --> 35:33.350
I look at you and I see
someone stained by death.

35:33.400 --> 35:36.340
I think it haunts you
every single day.

35:37.320 --> 35:39.030
Just confess, Lee.

35:39.080 --> 35:41.280
I'm nearly there, anyway.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.840
I've got nothing else to say.

35:47.440 --> 35:51.120
Between you and Claire, I think
there's plenty still to say.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.550
I'm gonna make you say it.

36:07.840 --> 36:11.200
There's a question from the
jury. We're going back in.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.390
The jury have asked
to see a photograph

36:20.440 --> 36:25.150
of the view from the window
of the clifftop hut.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.140
We will get copies
to you straight away.

36:29.480 --> 36:32.600
And the second question
is to clarify...

36:34.560 --> 36:39.550
.. to clarify whether Mark Latimer
was ever questioned by the police

36:39.600 --> 36:41.520
as a suspect.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.710
Erm... Yes, he was.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.270
He was arrested for obstruction

36:47.320 --> 36:51.080
and spoken to in connection
with Danny's death.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.990
~ If they're asking those questions...
~ Doesn't necessarily mean anything.

36:58.040 --> 37:00.830
Of course it does. They're
going with the defence.

37:00.880 --> 37:04.080
They're in there saying
I might be the killer.

37:10.640 --> 37:13.750
~ What are you doing?!
~ Mocking up two different versions -

37:13.800 --> 37:15.600
Not now. Not now!

37:22.360 --> 37:23.910
~ All right, Mags?
~ Hi, Nige.

37:23.960 --> 37:26.230
~ Any news?
~ No, nothing yet.

37:50.840 --> 37:52.040
Ooh!

38:29.720 --> 38:31.790
Got anything juicy coming up next?

38:31.840 --> 38:34.750
~ Er... Armed robberies, Bristol.
~ Nice!

38:34.800 --> 38:37.510
~ You?
~ Sexual assault, Southwark.

38:37.560 --> 38:38.550
Oh.

38:38.600 --> 38:41.270
So, what do you think - the verdict?

38:41.320 --> 38:45.150
I think it could do either
way. What do you reckon?

38:45.200 --> 38:47.790
~ We've won.
~ Ha!

38:47.840 --> 38:53.120
Seriously, I mean, Jocelyn, she's
great, but she's past it.

38:55.960 --> 38:57.230
Abby.

39:00.240 --> 39:02.380
~ I wanted to say...
~ Mm?

39:04.520 --> 39:05.990
I think you're a truly...

39:06.040 --> 39:07.510
horrible person.

39:07.560 --> 39:10.400
The jury are coming back in.

39:31.240 --> 39:35.590
Madam Foreperson, please answer
my first question 'yes' or 'no'.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.270
Have you reached a verdict
on this defendant

39:38.320 --> 39:40.790
upon which you are all agreed?

39:40.920 --> 39:42.720
No.

39:43.920 --> 39:45.660
I can't do this.

39:48.040 --> 39:53.150
I would urge you to continue trying
to reach a unanimous verdict.

39:53.200 --> 39:56.230
But I am prepared to accept a verdict

39:56.280 --> 39:59.520
upon which at least
ten of you are agreed.

40:01.240 --> 40:04.480
Would you please now go with
the jury bailiff. Thank you.

40:11.200 --> 40:14.550
I keep thinking about that last
Sunday we were all together.

40:14.600 --> 40:16.190
Before you went to Florida.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.030
You came to ours for a barbecue

40:18.080 --> 40:21.510
and the boys all went out playing
football till it got dark.

40:21.560 --> 40:22.870
Way after it got dark.

40:22.920 --> 40:26.990
Tom came into your kitchen to get
torches so they could keep playing.

40:27.040 --> 40:29.750
I can still see them all now.

40:29.800 --> 40:34.160
I shut my eyes - the sun's setting,
I can see them all playing.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.840
Danny, Mark, Tom...

40:39.120 --> 40:40.990
.. and Nige and...

40:42.630 --> 40:43.630
Joe.

40:43.680 --> 40:46.150
Even the memories are spoiled.

40:48.080 --> 40:51.280
There's this moment where
Dan spotted me looking out.

40:52.400 --> 40:55.140
And he ran over in his yellow shirt.

40:56.360 --> 40:59.880
He ran to the window, all pink
and sweaty from running round.

41:01.560 --> 41:04.310
He pulled a face at the
window, it made me laugh.

41:04.360 --> 41:06.230
I pulled one back.

41:07.560 --> 41:10.160
My little boy pulling faces at me.

41:16.720 --> 41:20.470
I'm thinking of leaving
Mark. It's not working.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.790
Even when this is over,
it won't fix us.

41:22.840 --> 41:25.440
We're not the same people anymore.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.910
Be careful, though, Beth.

41:30.960 --> 41:34.680
You think you're alone in
that marriage, you're not.

41:35.840 --> 41:38.840
It's nothing compared
to being really alone.

41:44.720 --> 41:47.280
It's over, isn't it, between us?

41:50.560 --> 41:52.500
I think it might be.

41:56.520 --> 41:59.230
How does it work, though,
us without each other?

41:59.280 --> 42:02.080
Do you trust me to keep your secrets?

42:03.440 --> 42:06.310
As much as you trust
me to keep yours.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.520
What will you do?

42:09.800 --> 42:13.190
~ Go back to France, I suppose.
~ What's so great about France?

42:13.240 --> 42:15.160
Nobody knows me.

42:18.480 --> 42:20.150
Almost nobody.

42:22.400 --> 42:24.670
You shouldn't have hit me.

42:27.520 --> 42:30.820
~ You're lucky I stopped there.
~ What did you say?

42:31.480 --> 42:33.080
It's a joke.

42:36.160 --> 42:38.900
Thank God you never became a father.

42:46.240 --> 42:47.670
Where will you go?

42:47.720 --> 42:49.520
You're so stupid.

43:07.800 --> 43:10.000
Have you played that yet?

43:18.040 --> 43:19.510
Thank you.

43:32.360 --> 43:36.120
~ What are you doing here?
~ You want the bloody pendant? Have it.

43:37.960 --> 43:39.900
No. You took this?!

43:40.800 --> 43:42.310
You had this all along?!

43:42.360 --> 43:45.630
There's a verdict. Jury
are coming back in.

43:45.680 --> 43:49.080
No, no, no. You're not
leaving my sight. Come on!

44:06.320 --> 44:09.260
Could we have the jury
back in, please.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.940
~ What do you think?
~ Shh!

44:36.120 --> 44:40.200
Madam Foreperson, please answer
my first question 'yes' or 'no'.

44:41.400 --> 44:45.000
~ Have you reached a verdict
on this defendant?
~ Yes.

44:45.720 --> 44:49.030
Is this the verdict of
you all, or as a majority?

44:49.080 --> 44:50.620
A majority.

44:51.680 --> 44:54.280
Would the defendant please stand.

44:58.360 --> 45:01.350
Do you find the defendant
Joseph Michael Miller

45:01.400 --> 45:04.000
guilty, or not guilty?

45:05.305 --> 45:11.679
