Come on, McLean! You fucking mug!

00:58.640 --> 01:00.597
- Come on!
- I ain't done yet.

01:22.720 --> 01:24.518
<i>Crazy</i>

01:24.840 --> 01:29.631
<i>Crazy for feeling so lonely.</i>

01:31.120 --> 01:33.680
Come on, boy. Right here. Right here.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.192
<i>Worry</i>

01:43.120 --> 01:47.672
<i>Why do I let myself worry?</i>

04:29.520 --> 04:30.590
What've you done?

04:32.840 --> 04:33.876
I've wet meself.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.072
You filthy bastard!

04:38.920 --> 04:40.195
My dad is coming back soon.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.316
No, boy!

04:43.520 --> 04:45.398
I'm the guv'nor here. Your dad is dead!

04:46.600 --> 04:48.956
I'm your stepdad now, that's the end of it!

04:49.200 --> 04:51.715
<i>Your dad is dead, shut your crying!</i>

04:51.800 --> 04:52.836
<i>Mum's the guv'nor.</i>

04:52.920 --> 04:54.400
I'm the guv'nor.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.235
<i>A lady grabbed my arm</i>

04:57.320 --> 05:00.597
<i>She said, "You look a man on the pluck!"</i>

05:00.760 --> 05:03.992
<i>It might cost a tenner,</i>
<i>it might cost a bob!</i>

05:05.240 --> 05:10.076
It depends on the size of your mug!

05:11.560 --> 05:13.791
<i>Nine, ten. Nine, ten.</i>

05:14.760 --> 05:15.910
<i>Nine, ten.</i>

05:18.840 --> 05:19.876
Tea, Val?

05:27.800 --> 05:29.393
Oh, lovely.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.120
Len, slow down.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.512
Oh, mmm.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.076
Give me your hands.

05:49.800 --> 05:50.870
No, no, no, no.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.629
I'm alright.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.639
We're late for the rent again, Len.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.757
You said that we wouldn't have
to go into the pot.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.354
Leave it with me, Val.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.116
Lenny, I've made your breakfast.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.110
I'm off, Val.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.880
Lenny, what time are you going to be home?

06:15.840 --> 06:17.274
Carrots!

06:33.080 --> 06:34.275
Carrots.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.034
- Lenny.
- Hello, my son.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.634
How are you feeling today, boy?

06:38.720 --> 06:41.030
Strong as you like, Carrots,
strong as you like.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.157
Hey, when are you going to
get a proper job, boy, hey?

06:43.240 --> 06:44.594
Done with all that street rugging.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.913
Oh, you will get your collar felt,
you will, with all that soppy graft.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.798
Well, listen, the world is changing, boy.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.360
It's not like when we was nippers.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.320
You know, you got to have
an angle or a bit of cutlery

06:54.400 --> 06:56.198
and you have got to get into something, boy.

06:56.440 --> 06:59.160
I promise you, boy,
what I do is not technically illegal.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.800
Oh, technically illegal?
You are an armed robber.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.635
No. I am more like a... More like a saint.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.594
Redistributing wealth. It's quite spiritual.

07:08.820 --> 07:10.756
- Karma, boy.
- That'll get steam on the table.

07:10.840 --> 07:13.798
Here you go, Teresa. You need a couple
of new wheels on there, babe.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.109
Alright, boys, how are you?

07:15.200 --> 07:17.795
Come on, come on.
Put 'em up, put 'em up. Right here.

07:17.880 --> 07:20.714
Oh, harder. Oh, harder. Oh!

07:21.200 --> 07:22.429
Hello, hello mate.

07:22.560 --> 07:26.031
Come on, boy. Have a look at your boat, then.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.759
Look like Godzilla, boy.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.274
I've got character.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.712
Hands like broken melons.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.276
Proper use, boy. Potentialise yourself.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.115
Alright, good soul, good boy.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.839
Yeah, you have got to potentialise yourself.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.036
Put them to proper use.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.270
What do you mean, "Proper use"?

07:41.360 --> 07:44.000
I have three gypsy fights
lined up off my cousin Bootnose.

07:44.080 --> 07:47.073
No, listen. I mean, in the ring, boy.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.760
The ring?

07:48.840 --> 07:53.760
Carrots, I love you. You are my cousin,
but gloves are for poofs, alright?

07:53.840 --> 07:55.240
- Come on.
- Alright.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.033
Here, Trevor.

07:57.320 --> 07:58.356
Hiya, Lenny.

07:58.440 --> 08:01.239
I heard you been selling
that shit around my manor again.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.356
That gospel?

08:02.440 --> 08:03.840
Look, someone's been telling
you rubbish, boy.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.833
Well, if I find out it's true,
I'm coming after you

08:06.920 --> 08:07.956
and I'm gonna hurt you.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.360
- Hurt you!
- OK. OK, Lenny.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.238
And then I'm gonna feed it to you.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.433
- OK, Lenny.
- Fuck off!

08:15.240 --> 08:17.436
Hello, Katie. Come here, sweetheart.

08:17.560 --> 08:18.710
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.792
- You look beautiful, my love.
- Thank you.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.314
Go on, have a good one.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.959
- Hello, Frank.
- Right.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.158
- Lenny.
- Alright.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.512
Oh, have a look at her, Len.
She's golden, isn't she?

08:29.960 --> 08:31.189
She's hovering.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.312
God. She could straighten up Liberace.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.159
Hello, Treacle, this is Trixie.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.198
This is Sue's girl, Carrots.
Trixie, this is Carrots.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.760
Don't mind him, he is a little bit

08:39.840 --> 08:42.558
highly strung at present,
he's just got out of prison.

08:43.159 --> 08:44.833
You are actually just the man
I've been looking for.

08:44.920 --> 08:45.956
Oh, yeah?

08:46.040 --> 08:47.679
How do you fancy doing
a little favour for me?

08:48.440 --> 08:50.432
That Alan's been giving me mum agg again.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.631
Seems he won't take no for an answer.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.837
Keeps banging on the
door come 3:00 in the morning.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.071
I can see he's got you all aeriated.

08:57.720 --> 09:00.235
You leave it with me, alright?
I'll sort it out.

09:00.360 --> 09:01.919
Thanks, Len, that will mean the world to us.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.036
Good girl.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.397
I would drink your bathwater, I would.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.434
Full of yourself, ain't ya?

09:10.840 --> 09:12.569
I'll empty out later.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.029
- Alright.
- Ta-ta.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.156
Ta-ra.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.316
<i>As I was walking past St Paul's</i>

09:19.440 --> 09:22.114
<i>A lady grabbed me by the arm</i>

09:22.360 --> 09:25.000
<i>She said, "You look a man on pluck!"</i>

09:28.960 --> 09:30.917
Oh, morning, Alan.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.195
Speak of the devil.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.956
So, what is this I hear about
you terrorising Sue

09:36.040 --> 09:38.396
and her little girl Trixie, hmm?

09:38.520 --> 09:41.160
No, Len, I ain't, I swear.

09:41.800 --> 09:45.680
You swear. Well, someone's
telling porkies, Alan.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.037
Is it you or is it her?

09:49.280 --> 09:50.430
I'll drop round.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.677
I mean, it's only when
I've had a drink I swing round there.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.560
Oh, it's only when you've had a drink?

09:55.280 --> 09:57.795
Well, you're having a drink
right now, aren't you, Alan?

09:57.880 --> 09:59.109
Does that mean you are going
over there again?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.236
Giving her agg?

10:00.600 --> 10:01.954
Have I got to hurt you, Alan?

10:02.160 --> 10:03.276
Have I got to hurt him, Carrots?

10:03.360 --> 10:04.999
I am going to fucking hurt you, Alan?

10:05.120 --> 10:06.236
Leave off.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.352
I've just been paid,
I just fancied I'd have a lager.

10:08.680 --> 10:09.716
Oh, that's it then.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.272
Funny thing, Al,
you owe me a couple, didn't ya?

10:15.600 --> 10:17.273
- There you go.
- Thank fuck you bumped into me, Al.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.914
Now, you are going to go round Sue's

10:21.000 --> 10:24.152
and you are going to give this to her
and you are going to apologise.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.955
You are going to say you ain't
never going to bother her again.

10:27.960 --> 10:31.592
And then you are going to come back here
and you are going to tell me what she said.

10:34.760 --> 10:35.955
Fuck off, then.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.150
Go on, Alan, I ain't got all fucking day!

10:44.146 --> 10:45.436
What a mug.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.596
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, Carol.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.398
Oh, it's a lovely sight, look at that.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.840
You've nicked one of these before.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.440
- Morning, Len.
- Morning.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.960
We've a couple of them, haven't we?

10:56.520 --> 10:59.160
The Rozzers ain't catching you in that,
I tell you that, boy.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.236
Chaps.

11:01.800 --> 11:02.916
Fellas.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.071
- Carrots, how are you doing, son?
- Hey!

11:10.160 --> 11:12.550
- Alright, how is Lenny?
- Top of the world.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.678
Good boy. Stay out of trouble.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.720
- Carrots?
- Leslie!

11:16.960 --> 11:18.360
- Len, boy.
- Hello.

11:18.640 --> 11:19.790
- Les!
- Carrots!

11:19.880 --> 11:21.109
How's Douglas Haig, then, eh?

11:21.200 --> 11:22.600
Are you still farting mackerel?

11:22.720 --> 11:24.757
You two still on speaking terms?

11:25.600 --> 11:27.637
Already been half poisoned.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.752
Empty as a whore's handbag.

11:29.840 --> 11:32.071
- Who poisoned him?
- Reenie.

11:32.640 --> 11:35.678
Left a bucket of Gordon's
out on the side again.

11:36.120 --> 11:39.431
Silly moo. Doggy drunk himself half to death.

11:40.160 --> 11:44.120
They found him in a skip,
Wednesday week and he's...

11:44.200 --> 11:46.760
Alright now. He's great.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.593
Look at the smile on him.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.557
He ain't smiling, old timer.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.000
Look at him, his lip sticks out.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.357
Better top up his sherry, then, boy.
Always calms him down.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.794
Get me a pint while you're there.

11:59.160 --> 12:01.117
You ain't bought a drink since
the Blitz, have you?

12:01.200 --> 12:02.919
I ain't had any rump since then, neither.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.552
Shrapnel blew me bollocks off.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.520
Here, show Lenny your letter from the Queen.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.600
Say, Carrots, he was in the Somme, Leslie.

12:10.760 --> 12:11.876
I know.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.549
And you came back with what,
half a plastic leg,

12:14.640 --> 12:17.519
four bouts of syphilis
and someone else's dignity, didn't you?

12:17.600 --> 12:20.398
Yeah, and I would do it all
again if I had half a chance.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.069
- Beautiful, Bobby.
<i>- Oh, thank you very much, gentlemen.</i>

12:27.160 --> 12:29.072
<i>Thank you, Leslie. Thank you, Carrots.</i>

12:29.200 --> 12:31.112
He's a sociable man.

12:32.040 --> 12:35.558
Never leave your children unattended
with him, mind you.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.111
Alright. How about I get us another?

12:41.960 --> 12:43.280
It's alright. Play on, play on.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.716
Now, what are you having, boy?

12:45.800 --> 12:48.315
Oh, Treble rum, please, Reenie.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.319
What about you, Carrots?

12:51.400 --> 12:52.800
I'll have two jars of ale.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.837
Tepid or warm?

12:55.760 --> 12:59.720
Reenie, if you was 50 years younger,
I would dive straight up you.

13:00.120 --> 13:03.511
You dizzy queen, I'm 49.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.157
Life ain't been too kind,
has it, Treacle, hey?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.039
You will find out soon enough.

13:09.520 --> 13:13.036
Me and Reenie was pulling
babies out the rubble in the Blitz.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.754
Why do you think I'm still here every day?

13:16.840 --> 13:21.992
Cos every day is a gift,
that's why they call it the present.

13:28.920 --> 13:29.956
You alright?

13:32.920 --> 13:33.956
Guv'nor.

13:36.720 --> 13:37.756
Your dad is dead!

13:38.880 --> 13:40.599
I said I'm the fucking guv'nor!

13:42.720 --> 13:45.952
He's a right raving nutcase, that Roy, sure.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.191
Yeah, well, I am a more raving nutcase.

13:48.280 --> 13:49.919
Oh, let it go, lad.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.755
He's been committed, you ain't.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.196
Not yet.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.555
Roy Shaw did a chunk in Broadmoor.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.274
Nutted himself out of a cell.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.716
They said he was blind drunk on Largactil.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.280
They tampered with him.

14:03.560 --> 14:07.110
They gave him electroshock treatment
to control his temper.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.157
Then they said his ears was burning,

14:09.240 --> 14:12.677
so they pumped him full of Bavarian ginseng.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.914
Even the Krays gave him a right wide berth

14:16.000 --> 14:18.310
when they ghosted him out to Parkhurst.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.393
He robs banks and breaks bricks with his nut.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.830
I seen him do it live at the Monday Club.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.038
He's insane.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.197
And he speaks in tongues.

14:28.280 --> 14:31.114
Right. Well, I know what I'm
going to do then.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.671
I'm gonna knock him spark out
and be back in here for lunch.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.799
- Carrots!
- There's a boy.

14:39.880 --> 14:40.916
Ding, ding.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.196
Where is he, then?

14:52.840 --> 14:53.876
Good luck, Lenny.

14:54.720 --> 14:55.756
What?

14:56.760 --> 14:58.513
I'll give you a score. He will need it.

14:59.520 --> 15:00.920
- You alright, son?
- Yeah, I'm alright, mum.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.318
Ding, ding.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.630
This is Frank Warren, he's promoting you.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.760
He is going places.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.998
- This is Valerie, Carrots.
- Hello sweetheart, Nice to meet you.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.840
And this is our boy, Lenny.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.115
Alright, Lenny.

15:17.360 --> 15:18.555
I hear good things, alright.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.672
There is a lot of money to be made
if we do things right.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.759
Just because this is unlicensed,
don't mean it's illegal.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.760
I remember you when you was
emptying them slot machines.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.638
Well, the kid's got ambition, ain't he?

15:28.720 --> 15:30.279
Nothing wrong with a bit of ambition.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.511
Why should Solomon's and Duff
make all the dough? Eh?

15:32.680 --> 15:35.195
Besides, I am giving most of
the money to a children's charity.

15:35.520 --> 15:36.590
- Oh.
- If you say so.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.716
Very noble.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.830
<i>Testing, testing, one two, one two.</i>

16:01.040 --> 16:04.192
<i>And it's the Guv'nor.</i>

16:06.400 --> 16:10.189
- Roy Shaw!
- <i>I'm the guv'nor!</i>

16:10.400 --> 16:12.119
<i>Testing. One, two, one, two.</i>

16:12.560 --> 16:15.951
<i>The Guv'nor.</i>

16:21.080 --> 16:24.517
<i>The Guv'nor. Roy Shaw.</i>

16:29.720 --> 16:30.790
Lenny.

16:31.520 --> 16:32.556
Lenny boy.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.640
<i>One, two. One, two.
Testing, one, two, one, two.</i>

16:42.080 --> 16:43.116
There you go.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.800
These gloves ain't right.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.520
No, these are good gloves.
Nothing wrong with these gloves.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.031
- How are we doing, alright?
- Alright, Frank.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.838
- Have we got the purse?
- Yeah, it's here.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.036
Lovely.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.959
- What's this?
- Don't give me that look.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.872
Money is money, right? It's all we got.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.673
Frank, these gloves ain't right, mate.

17:05.119 --> 17:06.792
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.880
There is nothing wrong with these gloves.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.077
- They are my gloves.
- I can't close my hands.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.079
Lenny, it's just a little bit of nerves.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.038
I don't get fucking nerves, John John.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.920
That's a boy.
You're gonna kill that Roy Shaw, boy.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.915
Len! Len! Len, calm down.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.840
Len, what's wrong?

17:38.720 --> 17:40.518
Len, it's time,
the Guv'nor has just got here.

17:40.720 --> 17:41.995
He ain't the Guv'nor!

17:42.080 --> 17:44.151
Alright, you go tell him that.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.037
Right, out. Come on out!

17:54.600 --> 17:58.389
Len, Len, Len, come here, calm down.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.235
Come on, look, Len.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.035
Len, look at me.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.156
Look at me. Now, stop.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.637
You've got this, OK?

18:06.200 --> 18:07.395
Look at me.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.837
It's all up here
what you've got to do, alright?

18:11.320 --> 18:12.959
- OK? Alright?
- Alright.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.595
Now, calm down.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.076
You're my man. Now, come here.

18:19.560 --> 18:23.839
OK. Now go out there
and fucking kill him, alright?

18:24.040 --> 18:25.633
- Alright.
- Come on.

18:33.520 --> 18:36.433
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

18:37.200 --> 18:40.591
<i>Out of Hoxton and in the blue corner,</i>

18:41.760 --> 18:47.233
<i>Lenny "Boy" McLean.</i>

19:04.920 --> 19:08.277
<i>And out of Dagenham,</i>

19:08.880 --> 19:12.510
<i>in the red corner,</i>

19:12.880 --> 19:16.317
<i>the toughest man in Britain!</i>

19:19.520 --> 19:22.274
<i>The Mean Machine,</i>

19:22.360 --> 19:24.192
<i>the Guv'nor.</i>

19:25.040 --> 19:28.750
<i>Roy Shaw!</i>

19:28.840 --> 19:31.753
<i>And, ladies and gentlemen, your referee.</i>

19:34.080 --> 19:35.150
You're nothing, McLean.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.311
I want a good strong fight, you two.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.591
No punching in the nuts, no biting.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.831
And if it goes down to ground,
none of that stamping, alright?

19:41.920 --> 19:43.274
Fuck off!

19:43.920 --> 19:45.274
- You alright?
- Oh, yeah.

20:03.520 --> 20:04.590
Come on, Lenny!

20:16.240 --> 20:17.276
Get in there, Lenny. Come on!

20:18.320 --> 20:19.356
Come on, Len.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.799
Is that all you got, Shaw?

20:27.000 --> 20:28.036
Come on!

20:47.440 --> 20:48.556
I can't watch this.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.599
Is that what you got, Shawy?

20:51.880 --> 20:53.917
You fucking cunt. Come on.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.556
You're nothing, boy.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.076
Oh, my God.

21:12.560 --> 21:17.351
<i>I'm making him a man.
I'm doing this for his own benefit.</i>

21:41.160 --> 21:42.196
Come on!

22:13.080 --> 22:16.312
What a wanker, he went out like a light.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.040
Don't look at me.

22:29.880 --> 22:31.155
He's an ex-pro.

22:32.560 --> 22:33.596
What did you expect?

22:34.200 --> 22:35.429
He don't train.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.433
He's half cut half the time.

22:37.640 --> 22:40.075
- He's out of shape.
- He's not only out of shape, John.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.560
He's out of pocket.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.075
I ain't living like this no more, Lenny,
do you fucking hear me?

22:44.760 --> 22:46.717
It is not my fault, Val.
He gave me dodgy gloves.

22:46.800 --> 22:47.995
I couldn't even close my hands.

22:48.280 --> 22:49.680
There is nothing wrong with these gloves.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.911
I won the ABA's with these gloves.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.114
I will have a word with Frank.

22:56.320 --> 22:59.711
I will raise the purse and get a rematch.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.317
Maybe get some of your pride back.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.319
You are meant to be the pro
boxer here, John John.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.198
You ain't done a good job of
training your cousin, have ya?

23:07.280 --> 23:09.317
Val, he said he didn't want training.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.312
He said he was going
to knock him spark out, to be fair.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.710
You're his best mates, Carrots.
So how's he got like this?

23:14.920 --> 23:16.149
Shut up!

23:18.560 --> 23:21.200
You lost all of our money.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.276
I'll get it back, Val.

23:24.640 --> 23:25.790
Really? How?

23:26.160 --> 23:27.514
I'll train harder.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.151
I'll be better, I'll be a better fighter.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.517
You are a drunk, Lenny.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.396
You've just lost all our money.

23:35.880 --> 23:39.510
Tell me how are we going to get it
back, tell me how are we going to eat?

24:00.560 --> 24:02.074
<i>You're nothing, McLean.</i>

24:06.680 --> 24:07.875
- Roy wants another...
- No, John.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.553
- You know what I'm going...
- One round.

24:09.720 --> 24:11.712
I am promoting a fight, not a mugging.

24:11.800 --> 24:14.998
He is a bit nervous, he got a bit ring shy.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.037
I mean, he is great on the cobbles.

24:17.120 --> 24:20.113
John, I can't sell tickets for
ring shy, alright?

24:20.560 --> 24:22.233
I'm not interested, I'm sorry.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.196
You're in this for the long haul, aren't you?

24:26.080 --> 24:28.800
I mean, your boy Shaw, he is pushing 40.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.591
Who's gonna fill his boots, eh?

24:32.200 --> 24:33.350
I tell you what...

24:33.760 --> 24:36.514
If you can raise a purse
big enough to turn Roy's head,

24:36.600 --> 24:39.911
then you come and see me,
but no promises, John, alright?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.036
Thanks, mate.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.272
Fucking hell, are you sure this is him?

24:45.800 --> 24:48.076
Here, Kenny, it's the Ant Hill mob.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.236
Alright, mush.

24:51.360 --> 24:53.397
This is Kenny Mac,
who I've told you all about.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.193
Alright, short stuff. I'm Lenny.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.397
Hey, I know your boat.
I've heard you're a little bit tasty

24:57.520 --> 24:59.557
- with your hands and all, ain't ya?
- Yeah, OK, soppy bollocks.

24:59.640 --> 25:00.869
Alright, Ken. Carrots.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.360
Alright, Carrots. How are you, son?

25:02.440 --> 25:04.033
Have they rehabilitated you or what?

25:04.120 --> 25:05.270
Do it standing on my head, Ken.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.754
When's the man want his motor back?

25:06.840 --> 25:08.069
They've had a lucky dip, though.

25:08.160 --> 25:09.719
Fuck me, it ain't Benidorm, is it?

25:10.120 --> 25:13.238
Listen, boys, we can make
ourselves a right few fucking quid here.

25:13.320 --> 25:15.915
As long as you can go through those gyppos
like shit through a blanket...

25:16.000 --> 25:17.400
- Eh...
- We will all get paid.

25:18.360 --> 25:22.036
Lenny, what do you think of
your new training camp?

25:22.120 --> 25:23.440
Splendid.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.876
Other than that big pile of
horse shit in the corner.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.600
That's not horse shit, that's a fly catcher.

25:28.680 --> 25:31.559
Keeps all the flies over that
side of the yard and none over here.

25:31.880 --> 25:34.554
Go and help yourself, boys.
Mind little Snowflake down there, won't ya?

25:38.360 --> 25:39.635
Snowflake.

25:40.760 --> 25:43.434
- Your own dressing room.
- Oh, lovely.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.635
- You still thirsty, boy?
- Yeah.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.956
John John, get us a crate of
light ales, will ya?

25:49.080 --> 25:52.175
Yeah. You get your wallet out,
I'll get the beers, then.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.591
Hey, how about we do a bit of training?

25:56.400 --> 25:57.914
Alright, well, get changed.

25:58.160 --> 25:59.310
Looking good.

25:59.840 --> 26:02.355
Have they set a date
for your ruck with Roy Shaw again?

26:02.440 --> 26:03.760
- Yep.
- Is it gospel?

26:06.200 --> 26:08.271
One more, one more, Len.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.313
I'm really sorry, Kevin. I'm really sorry.

26:19.400 --> 26:20.595
- This is not boxing.
- I know, I know.

26:26.640 --> 26:27.756
Faster.

26:28.360 --> 26:30.955
- You carry on.
- What's the point of that?

26:33.040 --> 26:34.156
I'm knackered.

26:34.520 --> 26:36.876
I'm not the one who's got to fight
a bunch of gypsies in the ring.

26:38.440 --> 26:41.160
See, that's it, boy, right.
That's it, drop it.

26:42.680 --> 26:44.273
Oh, this is fucking bollocks.

26:45.440 --> 26:46.510
Fuck off!

26:49.520 --> 26:51.830
Put them up, come on.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.034
You run like a poof.

27:19.800 --> 27:20.916
Have you got a fag?

27:29.080 --> 27:31.720
All the way down, all the way down,
all the way down, that's it.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.080
That's it! Alright, good boy...

27:34.360 --> 27:36.113
Lenny, I never heard of him.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.713
I am strong, you know that, Paddy.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.519
I've had my food, I am fed.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.160
But full I win fair and square, huh?

27:44.360 --> 27:45.237
Bring him out.

27:45.680 --> 27:46.670
Oh.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.880
- Here we go.
- What's the news, then?

27:48.960 --> 27:50.633
Chipper has been scoffing it down mum's caf.

27:50.920 --> 27:53.310
- Oh, yeah, what's he had?
- Two saveloys, three mash,

27:53.400 --> 27:57.960
one steak dinner, fried egg, bit of Spam
and two large chips and gravy.

27:58.080 --> 27:59.116
Travelling light, then.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.600
- Is that it or what?
- No.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.797
I'll send him to hospital,
you can bet on that.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.437
I take his fucking head off his body,
simple as, Paddy.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.831
Tizer, tea and five roll-ups.

28:08.040 --> 28:09.759
Good lad. Here you are, here's your guinea.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.911
Now treat yourself, go on, sling your hook.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.920
So, listen. Then, when you get in there,
I want you to punch him as hard as you can

28:16.000 --> 28:17.753
above the bollocks, in the derby, here.

28:18.520 --> 28:20.557
I guarantee you he will spill his load.

28:20.840 --> 28:22.513
Where are you? Come on.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.439
- Limber up, boy.
- Alright.

28:25.800 --> 28:26.950
Where the fuck is he?

28:27.200 --> 28:29.874
I'll make shite of him, he's only a pup.

28:31.760 --> 28:33.592
There's no man on two legs to beat me.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.838
Alright, I'll catch up with you in a second.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.640
Come on, Lenny, you bollocks, where are ya?

28:39.690 --> 28:41.090
Fucking hell.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.280
Knock a bag of shite out of you.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.717
Get over here now, I'll make shite of you.

28:50.080 --> 28:51.116
Fuck you.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.316
Mmm.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.234
Where are you?
You're not fuckin' foolin' with me.

28:54.320 --> 28:55.356
Get out here.

28:59.680 --> 29:00.716
Come on, Lenny!

29:08.880 --> 29:10.758
Len, you're supposed
to wait for the fucking bell.

29:10.840 --> 29:13.150
- What bell?
- This fucking bell. What's the matter?

29:13.400 --> 29:15.232
Alright! Alright! Alright!

29:18.720 --> 29:20.279
I want my fucking money!

29:21.200 --> 29:22.759
Oh, I feel like a cup of tea.

29:32.920 --> 29:34.912
The gyppos are still here, boy.

29:38.440 --> 29:39.715
What do they want?

29:40.920 --> 29:42.798
Bad news, Len. The party's over.

29:42.880 --> 29:43.996
The chaps are here.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.399
They're saying that they want the purse back.

29:46.520 --> 29:47.840
You should have waited for the bell.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.270
Right.

29:53.600 --> 29:57.196
You tell them that
the party ain't started, John John!

29:57.840 --> 30:01.038
I came here to fight and get paid for a fight

30:01.120 --> 30:04.397
and now I've had my fight
and I've been paid for that fight.

30:04.520 --> 30:07.080
So you tell them to fuck off!

30:09.040 --> 30:10.599
Well, what do they say?

30:12.040 --> 30:13.554
Did you tell them what I said?

30:14.440 --> 30:17.353
Well, I didn't need to.
We can all fucking hear you.

30:18.280 --> 30:19.999
Well, what do they say?

30:20.640 --> 30:22.040
Same as, boy.

30:22.960 --> 30:27.159
They want their purse back
and they are quite happy to take it outside.

30:27.240 --> 30:30.597
Well, you tell them I will
take it inside, alright?

30:31.720 --> 30:33.439
Oh, they are getting a bit flamboyant.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.875
- Are you decent, Len?
- Fucking hell! Hold on.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.359
Alright, let them in.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.320
So you want your fucking money back, do you?

30:53.040 --> 30:54.952
Well, let me pay you cash in hand!

31:01.800 --> 31:02.916
Which one, you or you?

31:12.080 --> 31:13.912
Come here! Fuck off!

31:14.120 --> 31:16.680
Fuck off back to Dublin, you slags!

31:23.080 --> 31:24.400
That's mine, I think.

31:25.160 --> 31:26.958
Yeah, I think you've earned it, Len.

31:28.960 --> 31:31.750
- Bootnose.
- Here, you don't want a rematch, do you?

31:32.500 --> 31:33.598
I thought not.

31:33.680 --> 31:36.673
You see what you
fucking done there, Bootnose?

31:36.760 --> 31:38.991
- What?
- My tea has gone cold.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.394
<i>I'm the Guv'nor.</i>

32:01.000 --> 32:03.231
You fucking slag! Get up!

32:04.840 --> 32:06.069
Leave him!

32:11.120 --> 32:12.156
<i>I'm making him a man!</i>

32:14.760 --> 32:15.796
Nine, ten.

32:35.520 --> 32:36.874
<i>He loves you, Val.</i>

32:37.360 --> 32:39.750
<i>He lives for you, he lives to make you happy.</i>

32:39.840 --> 32:40.876
<i>Make you safe.</i>

32:40.960 --> 32:44.351
<i>You see, there is nothing in the world</i>
<i>that he cares about more than you, Val.</i>

32:44.440 --> 32:48.229
<i>But this Shaw thing gives a man purpose,</i>

32:48.320 --> 32:49.549
<i>make you complete.</i>

32:50.520 --> 32:53.991
<i>Look, I don't know what happened</i>
<i>when Lenny was a little boy,</i>

32:54.880 --> 32:56.360
<i>I don't know what is going on in his head.</i>

32:56.440 --> 32:57.510
<i>I don't know what...</i>

32:57.600 --> 32:58.920
<i>I don't know what you're thinking, boy.</i>

33:00.360 --> 33:05.151
<i>But when you are in that ring</i>
<i>and the ref holds up your hand</i>

33:06.000 --> 33:07.229
<i>and those people cheer,</i>

33:10.240 --> 33:12.835
<i>it wipes the slate clean, see.</i>

33:16.520 --> 33:17.840
<i>He loves you, Val.</i>

33:23.520 --> 33:24.556
Alright?

33:39.000 --> 33:40.036
Alright.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.958
How are you Mrs A?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.514
What you done to your hands?

33:48.160 --> 33:50.914
Oh, I fell over on someone's chin.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.075
How much for them?

33:54.840 --> 33:57.992
- Two bob a pop, same as always.
- How much for the lot of them?

33:58.320 --> 33:59.674
Are you going to eat them all at once?

33:59.920 --> 34:00.990
I'm a light eater.

34:01.400 --> 34:04.074
As soon as it's light, I start eating.

34:04.720 --> 34:06.313
Mmm, are you celebrating?

34:07.040 --> 34:10.875
I just fought a hundred gyppos,
won all Val's money back.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.713
Are you spending your wife's money?

34:12.800 --> 34:13.916
That's a liberty, boy.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.436
I ain't taken a liberty in my whole life.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.514
You take care, Mrs A.

34:26.159 --> 34:27.719
Give my love to Val, won't ya?

34:27.800 --> 34:29.120
Alright, Lenny?

34:29.199 --> 34:30.759
I heard you got done by Shaw.

34:30.840 --> 34:33.196
- He's fighting again.
- Go on, Lenny, give us a cake.

34:35.120 --> 34:37.237
Roy Shaw is nothing. Here.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.315
There he is.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.076
You alright?

34:58.440 --> 34:59.999
Yeah. No, he's a...

35:00.720 --> 35:02.552
- Lenny.
- Alright, Len.

35:03.240 --> 35:05.038
Listen, keep shtum about
Davey's old lady, would you?

35:05.600 --> 35:07.353
Why, what's the SP on that?

35:07.600 --> 35:10.718
His wife's only run off with
the handsome geezer off the cockle stall.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.311
Well, don't you worry.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.996
Your secret is safe with me, boy.

35:21.560 --> 35:22.755
Hey, how are you doing, Lenny?

35:22.880 --> 35:23.916
Alright.

35:30.800 --> 35:31.836
Ooh.

35:37.120 --> 35:38.156
You don't mind, do you?

35:39.200 --> 35:41.396
In that case, I'll have another.

35:45.160 --> 35:46.196
Ah.

35:47.040 --> 35:48.440
Hello, ladies.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.716
Hi, Lenny.

35:50.360 --> 35:51.635
Oi, oi, Trixie.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.794
Hello, Trixie!

35:55.640 --> 35:56.676
You alright?

35:58.840 --> 36:00.069
Alright, Lenny?

36:03.200 --> 36:04.395
Thank you, Ethel.

36:08.720 --> 36:11.315
You alright? You having a good time?

36:13.640 --> 36:14.710
What?

36:15.720 --> 36:16.870
Just checking.

36:31.560 --> 36:32.596
Davey!

36:33.360 --> 36:34.999
Oh, I just spoke to Terry.

36:35.080 --> 36:37.151
He told me the bad news, commiserations.

36:37.520 --> 36:38.795
What are you talking about, Len?

36:39.400 --> 36:41.198
What, you mean you don't know?

36:41.280 --> 36:43.715
Well, brace yourself, son.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.918
I hear your wife is having it
off with the cockle man

36:47.000 --> 36:49.390
and they are off to live in
Lanzarote Tuesday week.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.876
Do what? Lanzarote?

36:51.960 --> 36:53.519
Lanzarote.

36:54.560 --> 36:55.596
Bye, Davey.

36:59.400 --> 37:00.993
I'll have one more, Ethel.

37:02.560 --> 37:03.596
Mmm.

37:12.920 --> 37:13.956
Mickey!

37:14.440 --> 37:15.635
You alright, Len?

37:16.200 --> 37:17.350
Alright.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.032
You alright on the booze there, Len, are you?

37:27.920 --> 37:29.513
Heard you had a fight coming up.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.076
What was that, Mickey?

37:32.160 --> 37:33.196
What do you mean, Mickey?

37:33.280 --> 37:34.760
What do you mean? No, no, no.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.069
No, what do you mean, Mickey?

37:36.200 --> 37:37.873
Shut your fucking mouth, Mickey!

37:37.960 --> 37:38.996
I didn't say anything.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.400
Are you fucking mad, Mick?

37:40.520 --> 37:41.556
I'm sorry, mate.

37:43.080 --> 37:44.116
Sit down, boy.

37:44.200 --> 37:46.750
Listen, we're having a nice night out.
Ethel, we'll have two light ales, babe.

37:47.920 --> 37:49.718
You like a nice light ale, did you boy, eh?

37:57.960 --> 37:59.633
Take this over to Trixie, will you?

38:21.880 --> 38:24.679
Who wants to see my party trick? Hey?

38:25.040 --> 38:28.317
You want to see me do five?
Fuck it, I'll do five.

38:28.520 --> 38:30.398
Ethel, line up five more, please.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.074
Oh, Lenny, please. No.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.078
Ethel, five.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.635
You want to hear a joke while we're waiting?

38:41.280 --> 38:43.795
Me wife just left me. She was cross-eyed.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.716
I'm sure she was seeing someone else.

38:56.360 --> 38:57.635
What a fucking performance!

39:00.560 --> 39:02.074
- Look what he's done.
- You're welcome.

39:06.520 --> 39:07.556
That's enough, Lenny.

39:07.720 --> 39:08.836
What?

39:09.200 --> 39:10.429
You're scaring the ladies.

39:12.880 --> 39:16.396
Oh, right. I see.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.194
Well, I am very sorry.

39:22.440 --> 39:23.590
I need a slash.

39:29.160 --> 39:30.196
Fucking...

39:34.520 --> 39:35.874
He's ruined everything.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.399
Who wants a drink, then?

39:39.520 --> 39:40.795
Hey, who wants a...

39:41.760 --> 39:43.240
Where did everybody go?

39:44.920 --> 39:47.799
Oh, I found this in there, Ethel.

39:48.120 --> 39:49.156
All clogged up.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.956
- Reenie's going to kill me, Len.
- No.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.393
I'm gonna have a word with him.
He's a fucking lunatic!

39:54.520 --> 39:57.433
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, slow down, alright?
Leave it to me.

39:57.680 --> 39:59.114
A lunatic?

40:00.120 --> 40:03.796
So, are you gonna
slap her ass for that or am I?

40:03.880 --> 40:05.109
Leave it, Lenny.

40:06.080 --> 40:08.879
- She means well.
- Oh, she means well.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.674
Don't be a burglar all your life,
Carrots, take a night off, hey?

40:12.760 --> 40:14.956
I'm taking the whole fucking week off, boy.

40:19.920 --> 40:23.357
I done you and your old dear
a favour, didn't I?

40:23.440 --> 40:25.272
And now, suddenly I'm a lunatic.

40:25.360 --> 40:26.510
Make up her mind.

40:26.680 --> 40:28.717
I didn't ask for no favours, Len.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.038
You asked me how I was and I told you.

40:31.320 --> 40:32.959
Get this tart away from me.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.239
I ain't surprised your wife's leaving you.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.080
What did you say to me?

40:39.440 --> 40:40.635
What did you fucking say to me?

40:40.720 --> 40:42.871
Rumour has it
she's had enough of your rucking.

40:43.320 --> 40:44.640
We're just marking your card.

40:45.560 --> 40:47.074
I can tell you for one, Lenny.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.551
Never trust a woman on her word.

40:56.560 --> 40:58.199
We act on our feelings.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.911
You men just ignore your feelings,

41:01.000 --> 41:04.232
but that don't mean nothing if
you don't honour your woman,

41:05.400 --> 41:07.392
listen to what's in their hearts.

41:08.240 --> 41:10.914
But if you have got her heart,
well, then, you've got her hand.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.996
And rumour has it, Val's been heartbroken.

41:18.400 --> 41:21.313
Fuck you. I know what my own wife wants.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.555
She wants the best!

41:32.040 --> 41:33.520
You've come second, though, ain't ya?

41:34.120 --> 41:35.395
Alright! Alright.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.796
Right. Let's put this all
to bed now, alright?

41:37.880 --> 41:39.599
We've had a drink, Trix.

41:39.960 --> 41:42.350
Len. Alright, for fuck's sake.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.350
Fuck's sake.

41:47.680 --> 41:49.273
Val is my one and only, you know.

41:49.840 --> 41:50.956
Listen, I know she is, boy.

41:51.080 --> 41:52.833
So you any good at laundry, Lenny?

41:53.600 --> 41:54.829
Calm down, now.

41:56.960 --> 41:58.030
Do what?

41:58.720 --> 41:59.756
Laundry.

42:00.360 --> 42:02.113
The cleaning, cooking.

42:02.560 --> 42:04.791
You probably better learn
in case she's already gone

42:04.880 --> 42:06.599
- and don't come back.
- Carrots,

42:07.040 --> 42:09.999
get this fucking tart
away from me, let's slip.

42:11.520 --> 42:13.113
He ain't going nowhere. He's staying with me.

42:15.440 --> 42:19.195
For fuck's sake, Carrots. What is this, hey?

42:19.280 --> 42:21.875
He don't want to have it
with you, can't you see?

42:22.240 --> 42:24.197
His business and what he does
and where he goes

42:24.280 --> 42:25.839
and who he's with is nothing to do with you.

42:25.920 --> 42:27.400
So stop hanging around his neck!

42:29.600 --> 42:31.159
You can't give him what I've got.

42:32.760 --> 42:33.876
Everyone hates you.

42:34.880 --> 42:38.237
- Hmm.
- You're a menace and a nuisance

42:38.840 --> 42:40.433
- and a bully.
- Hey.

42:40.680 --> 42:42.034
Take a look around you, Len.

42:42.920 --> 42:44.036
Everyone's gone.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.638
- You've ruined everyone's fucking night.
- Shut your fucking mouth.

42:47.720 --> 42:50.679
- You stupid, useless slag.
- Fuck off!

42:51.440 --> 42:53.113
Are you gonna let him
fucking touch me like that?

42:53.200 --> 42:54.395
Where you going, boy?

42:54.520 --> 42:56.432
Len, wait. Come here, you!

42:56.560 --> 42:58.119
Fucking beat the shit.

42:58.640 --> 43:00.552
That's it, babe. Do him!

43:02.160 --> 43:04.800
You're the Guv'nor, babe.

43:08.920 --> 43:09.956
Lenny!

43:10.360 --> 43:12.636
Lenny! Lenny, you're killing him!

43:15.000 --> 43:16.434
Lenny, stop!

43:16.920 --> 43:17.956
Lenny!

43:18.960 --> 43:20.280
Get off him!

43:20.360 --> 43:22.079
Get off! Get off!

43:26.080 --> 43:27.230
Lenny!

43:27.920 --> 43:28.990
Lenny!

43:29.680 --> 43:30.750
Lenny!

43:42.280 --> 43:44.875
Lenny! Lenny what have you done?

43:46.000 --> 43:47.320
You've killed him.

43:48.200 --> 43:49.793
You've killed him!

43:52.360 --> 43:53.510
Lenny!

43:56.120 --> 43:58.760
Carrots! Carrots!

43:59.320 --> 44:00.356
Carrots.

44:03.560 --> 44:04.630
Please, no.

44:32.160 --> 44:33.879
<i>Ten, nine, ten.</i>

44:35.080 --> 44:38.391
<i>Nine, ten, nine, ten, nine, ten.</i>

44:39.080 --> 44:42.312
<i>Nine, ten, nine, ten, nine, ten.</i>

44:43.600 --> 44:47.037
<i>Nine, ten, nine, ten, nine, ten.</i>

45:10.000 --> 45:11.275
What have you done, Len?

45:12.680 --> 45:13.716
Turn round.

45:20.680 --> 45:21.875
Oh, my God.

45:26.280 --> 45:27.509
Right, sit down, Len.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.429
Len, sit down!

45:48.960 --> 45:50.555
<i>Lenny!</i>

46:09.600 --> 46:10.954
I've got to get to Nan's, Len.

46:13.920 --> 46:15.354
I've got to get to Nan's, Len.

46:16.440 --> 46:17.510
What?

46:17.640 --> 46:20.109
I've got to take my little brother to Nan's.

46:20.640 --> 46:21.960
He's hurt.

46:22.520 --> 46:24.671
Jimmo beat him up on his legs and his back.

46:24.760 --> 46:27.559
He kept hitting him with his feet
and his hands and his belt.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.156
Kruger.

46:30.360 --> 46:31.840
Can you tell Nan we're coming?

46:33.520 --> 46:35.239
Hit me too with his feet.

46:40.320 --> 46:42.073
Me mum's the Guv'nor.

46:43.080 --> 46:44.116
I know.

46:46.560 --> 46:47.835
I know she is.

46:51.040 --> 46:54.397
Listen, Lenny, she made us promise her.

46:55.720 --> 46:58.997
She made us promise her
not to kill him, Lenny, alright?

46:59.320 --> 47:01.551
You get round Nan's.

47:03.440 --> 47:05.318
And she'll get your Uncle Spinks,

47:06.320 --> 47:10.394
and he's gonna belt
seven shades of shit out of that Irwin.

47:13.080 --> 47:15.072
That gutless coward.

47:20.600 --> 47:22.796
You gutless coward.

47:30.240 --> 47:31.754
Tell me. Is it true?

47:32.760 --> 47:34.240
He was dead, Val.

47:34.920 --> 47:37.230
They only just managed to resuscitate him.

47:37.600 --> 47:39.398
Your Lenny is a fucking savage.

47:39.560 --> 47:41.074
Lenny is my husband.

47:42.160 --> 47:43.355
How do you stick it?

47:43.440 --> 47:45.159
How can you stand there and call him that?

47:45.240 --> 47:46.993
He didn't mean it, you know he's a good man.

47:47.160 --> 47:48.799
Carrots is gonna be scarred for life.

47:48.920 --> 47:50.434
Calm down, for fuck's sake.

47:50.560 --> 47:52.950
His neck was hanging wide open.

47:53.040 --> 47:54.440
What have you said?

47:55.760 --> 47:57.558
The police want a statement off me.

47:59.200 --> 48:02.671
Trixie, you are going to keep
that little button mouth quiet.

48:03.160 --> 48:04.389
Do you understand me?

48:05.800 --> 48:07.632
Now, that is a step too far.

48:07.960 --> 48:09.952
What Lenny has done for you
and your family over the years

48:10.040 --> 48:12.157
and you're going to go
screaming off to the police?

48:13.920 --> 48:16.879
Are you sure you want to do that?

48:21.040 --> 48:26.877
You tell that animal, he comes near me
or Carrots or my mum ever again

48:26.960 --> 48:28.633
and I will get him lifed off for good.

48:31.120 --> 48:32.600
And I'm done with you too, Val.

48:55.440 --> 48:57.159
Are you a savage?

49:03.320 --> 49:05.118
You killed your best mate.

49:09.840 --> 49:14.232
He was dead for 10 minutes,
they only just resuscitated him.

49:19.360 --> 49:20.999
Can you hear me, Lenny?

49:25.360 --> 49:27.397
This ain't the man that I married.

49:34.240 --> 49:35.799
I can't do this no more.

49:49.320 --> 49:52.438
There once was a scared little coward,

49:52.560 --> 49:55.837
who were tearful and twisted and soured.

49:56.120 --> 49:59.670
No father, no guts, or lint to the nuts,

50:00.280 --> 50:04.718
so I've battered him out of his trousers.

50:22.320 --> 50:23.356
Are you a savage?

50:25.640 --> 50:26.915
This ain't the man that I married.

50:29.040 --> 50:30.076
I can't do this no more.

50:31.800 --> 50:33.314
Come on, Len.

50:50.740 --> 50:51.976
Come on, Len.

51:34.400 --> 51:35.436
Get in there.

51:36.520 --> 51:39.911
Ring the bell, ring the fucking bell.

51:49.720 --> 51:54.272
Breathe, breathe, breathe in,
suck it in, that's it.

51:54.800 --> 51:57.520
I don't know what you're doing
because it ain't fucking boxing

51:57.600 --> 52:00.240
but keep doing it,
he's out on his fucking boot.

52:00.320 --> 52:01.356
Water, drink some water.

52:01.840 --> 52:04.674
Cover the button, that's what
you wanna do. Don't be a mug.

52:10.640 --> 52:14.634
Get out there and knock that fucker's
spark out, he's out on his feet.

52:14.720 --> 52:15.836
That's it. Good boy, son.

52:15.920 --> 52:19.357
These, these are your weapons,
these are your weapons, go on.

52:23.800 --> 52:24.836
Come here.

52:52.760 --> 52:54.399
Disqualified. Disqualification.

52:55.560 --> 52:57.119
You have to fight again in a rematch.

52:57.240 --> 52:58.560
Disqualified? What do you mean?

52:59.200 --> 53:00.270
We ain't done.

53:00.360 --> 53:02.352
You will never be the Guv'nor, McLean.

53:18.640 --> 53:20.916
Alright, Frankie boy,
I've come for the purse.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.992
John John, that was fantastic, mate.
He almost killed him.

53:23.120 --> 53:24.440
I know, he knocked him out the ring.

53:24.600 --> 53:27.240
Listen, don't worry about the purse, right,
we're gonna call it a draw.

53:27.320 --> 53:29.073
- Eh?
- And it's gonna roll over the purse, right?

53:29.160 --> 53:31.072
- But he won.
- We're gonna do the trilogy,

53:31.160 --> 53:32.674
- like the rubber match.
- Rubber...

53:32.760 --> 53:34.717
- What the... He knocked him on his arse.
- Listen to me. Look.

53:34.800 --> 53:37.110
We're gonna make some money.
Some proper money, alright?

53:37.200 --> 53:39.396
You just get the boy in shape
and you leave the rest to me.

53:39.520 --> 53:42.592
Good work, John. Proper money.
Good work, John.

53:42.680 --> 53:44.353
You changed your fucking tune.

53:45.600 --> 53:47.114
Fucking rubber match?

53:53.400 --> 53:54.436
Val.

53:56.200 --> 53:57.634
I done him.

53:59.280 --> 54:01.511
Did you see me? I done him.

54:02.640 --> 54:05.712
I won, Val. I did it once,
I will do it again.

54:05.840 --> 54:08.355
I will win that money back, Val, I promise.

54:08.880 --> 54:10.234
Please come home.

54:10.800 --> 54:12.200
I need you with me, Val.

54:13.440 --> 54:15.238
It's never been about that, Len.

54:16.360 --> 54:18.352
It's never been about the money.

54:19.080 --> 54:20.230
I love you, Len.

54:20.920 --> 54:22.149
But I can't come home.

54:30.440 --> 54:31.715
It's about you.

54:34.840 --> 54:36.115
Have you stopped drinking?

54:44.960 --> 54:46.599
I have to beat him, Val.

54:47.680 --> 54:49.000
I have to.

54:49.680 --> 54:51.114
I have to be the Guv'nor.

54:54.240 --> 54:55.560
I know you do, Len.

54:56.920 --> 54:58.036
Val.

54:59.880 --> 55:00.996
Val.

55:07.160 --> 55:08.674
Come on, boy.

55:12.520 --> 55:13.874
<i>Just ask for your money back, Lenny.</i>

55:16.760 --> 55:17.796
Huh.

55:17.880 --> 55:20.349
Don't ever fight Shaw again,
you already beat him.

55:20.440 --> 55:22.511
Just ask for your money back
and make it right with Val,

55:22.600 --> 55:24.159
move out to the country.

55:24.440 --> 55:26.909
It was your fight, Lenny, you won.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.798
You don't have to keep fighting.

55:30.040 --> 55:32.760
Every fight I've ever had I had for you.

55:33.800 --> 55:35.120
I know, Lenny.

55:37.360 --> 55:40.637
But we've only ever lost one fight,
haven't we, Lenny?

55:41.600 --> 55:45.037
<i>I love little pussy</i>

55:55.400 --> 55:57.756
I'm gonna top you, one day.

56:01.040 --> 56:03.077
Don't be like that, hey?

56:09.240 --> 56:10.799
Long way down ain't it, boy?

56:13.200 --> 56:14.316
Hey.

56:15.080 --> 56:19.879
You want to be careful you don't trip
one day and fall out this window.

56:40.760 --> 56:43.275
This is a quiet gentleman's sport.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.035
Therapeutical.

56:45.120 --> 56:46.270
Clear your mind.

56:46.360 --> 56:47.760
Yeah, it's quite calming.

56:47.840 --> 56:49.035
You off the sauce?

56:49.520 --> 56:52.194
Oh, I only drink lemonade now, John John.

56:53.160 --> 56:59.316
Yeah, booze, mmm. It is no good for a big
lump like me with a lot of aggression in him.

57:00.280 --> 57:02.875
That's a good boy, you keep that up.

57:04.920 --> 57:05.956
John John.

57:09.880 --> 57:11.712
I'm not a liberty-taker, am I?

57:12.200 --> 57:13.236
No.

57:13.320 --> 57:16.199
I can honestly say, boy,
you are not a liberty-taker.

57:17.440 --> 57:21.992
All the fights in all my life, I never...
I never once took a liberty.

57:23.920 --> 57:24.956
Except for one, you know...

57:25.280 --> 57:26.839
You had your back turned.

57:27.160 --> 57:28.992
You were walking away, weren't you?

57:29.360 --> 57:31.431
- Yeah.
- He wouldn't leave it.

57:32.160 --> 57:33.389
Trappy fucker.

57:34.160 --> 57:37.790
I'm in the Broadway playing snooker
and McLean's here.

57:38.200 --> 57:39.714
- Your break.
- Alright.

57:41.280 --> 57:45.069
I've got to train hard now, John John,
I've got to be a winner, alright?

57:46.080 --> 57:47.912
I promised Valerie, ain't I?

57:51.640 --> 57:53.597
I can't let my nut go wonky again.

57:53.960 --> 57:55.599
Yeah, well, none of us want that.

58:00.280 --> 58:03.990
Ignore them, boy. We're professionals.

58:04.640 --> 58:06.677
We only fight when we get paid.

58:10.280 --> 58:11.555
Ooh!

58:16.600 --> 58:20.389
Well, look at all you mugs.

58:21.400 --> 58:23.073
I'm here with my cousin

58:24.320 --> 58:26.391
trying to make a bit of a change in my life.

58:26.920 --> 58:30.357
See, I'm training now,
I've dropped the booze out,

58:30.520 --> 58:33.354
I'm strong and I'm getting fitter.

58:34.080 --> 58:38.393
Now, I don't know who you are

58:38.520 --> 58:42.560
but you're just the same
as all the other little Jack the Lads

58:42.640 --> 58:45.872
trying to make your name
on the strength of me.

58:46.520 --> 58:51.151
Ordinarily, I would've broken
your jaw in four places by now,

58:51.320 --> 58:55.553
but I'm just trying to enjoy
a little snooker with my pal.

58:56.560 --> 59:00.236
Now, I'm gonna take my shot

59:00.320 --> 59:04.439
and if you're still here when I turn around

59:04.560 --> 59:09.237
I'm gonna break every fucking bone
in your body.

59:13.360 --> 59:14.396
Lenny!

59:45.880 --> 59:47.553
I don't like violence, John John.

59:48.040 --> 59:51.351
I hate it, in fact. I detest it,

59:51.960 --> 59:55.840
but the problem with being nice
is that slags like these,

59:56.760 --> 59:58.399
they take it as a weakness.

59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.320
Violence is all you listen to, isn't it?

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.356
Trevor.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.232
Back in two minutes, John John.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.714
Trevor.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.199
Quiet gentleman's sport.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.509
Where are you going, then?

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.956
Lenny, it wasn't me, it wasn't me.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:20.253
You fucking... Fucking fag.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.430
You alright, old fella?

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.755
- All good, Lenny.
- Alright.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.918
I fucking hate Geordies.

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:34.874
What are you looking at?

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.431
- It's your shot.
- Oh, good.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.798
Ooh, looks like
you've snookered me, John John.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.678
Oh, bollocks.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:44.916
What?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.959
Oh, fuck, these were my favourite strides.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.673
I think you're going to need
a trip to the dry cleaners.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.680
Well, go ahead. Pull it out, John John.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:55.796
Come on.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.240
Fucking hell, are you sure?

01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.640
Oh.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.511
Ow, it's not that bad.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.399
I don't know, Len, it's a bit dirty.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.680
Yeah, it will be alright.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.319
My shot, is it?

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.720
Mrs McLean, the gangrene has spread
and we'll be forced to operate.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.396
How do you mean?

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.600
To amputate, Mrs McLean.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.676
There is no choice in the matter,
you do understand?

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.949
If we don't amputate
your husband's leg, he will die.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.958
He wouldn't want to live like that.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.079
Oh, Christ.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.280
Alright, Val?

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.030
Yeah.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.710
So, what are they saying, then, the doctors?

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.237
They stitched it up and it's got infected.

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.632
It was septicaemia.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.834
Now it's getting worse.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.000
Worse, what do you mean, worse?

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.355
We are doing all we can.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:33.999
All you can? He's in a coma.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.871
It was a penknife, it was about this big.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.434
No, that ain't right.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:39.950
Len.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.713
Lenny, wake up, son. Come on.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:45.158
Now stop showing off, I've had your suit
cleaned and all, come on.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:49.590
There's no choice in the matter,
we need to act now, I need your signature.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:55.394
<i>Mrs McLean, I need you to understand</i>
<i>that if we don't amputate your husband's leg,</i>

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.556
<i>he will die.</i>

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.440
<i>He wouldn't want to live like that.</i>

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.273
<i>He's gonna have to die.</i>

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:07.752
I can't bear this, Lenny, I need you.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.040
We're a team, remember?

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:25.113
Please, Lenny, Please come back to me.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.593
I can't live without you.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.074
Please come back to me.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.640
<i>Len, I've never heard of him.</i>

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.755
<i>Look at all you mugs.</i>

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.674
<i>Wild thing</i>

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.198
<i>You make my heart sing</i>

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.397
<i>You make everything groovy</i>

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.119
<i>Wild thing</i>

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.396
<i>Wild thing</i>

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.116
<i>I think I love you</i>

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.634
<i>But I wanna know for sure</i>

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.434
<i>Come on and hold me tight</i>

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:24.114
<i>I love you</i>

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.396
<i>Wild thing</i>

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.271
<i>You make my heart sing</i>

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.997
<i>You make everything groovy</i>

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.516
Well done.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.237
I made you, Lenny. I made you what you are.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.599
I'm proud of you, boy.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:08.437
You mad bastard.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.832
Where is he? Where's my fucking husband?

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.075
Calm down, please.

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:27.038
Don't tell me to fucking calm down,
where is he?

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.913
Listen, he checked himself out.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.874
We tried to keep him here, but when we
dressed his wounds the gangrene had healed.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:36.035
We've never seen
anything like it, Mrs McLean.

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.554
Oh, my Lord.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.312
So you're back, then?

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.310
Yeah.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.280
For good?

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.154
Yeah.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.517
I thought I'd lost you, Len.

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.074
Nah.

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.679
You ain't getting shot of me that easy.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.997
You're my one and only, Val.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.196
I know.

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.273
Bit of history here, boy.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.229
Freddie.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.640
Hey!

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:16.039
Have you still got my picture on your wall?

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:18.677
Look who I brought to darken your door.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:24.034
He's going to get fit, ain't ya?
He's going to train like a pro.

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.435
I'm gonna kill Roy Shaw.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.909
That's the spirit.

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.152
Yeah, alright. Box on.

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:31.913
Come on, you girls.

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:33.954
Shouldn't be too tight.

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:36.038
You want to look after your hands.

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.999
Your hands are your weapons.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.800
Gloves should feel like a second skin.

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:48.076
You make your hands into a box
and that's why they calls it boxing.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.037
Well, that is fascinating, John John.
Tell me more.

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.758
You know the difference between me and you?

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.355
Yeah, I'm handsome.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.079
About four stone.

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.000
You punch someone, they are spark out,

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.117
I punch someone,
they are going to hit me again.

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:07.238
Now Pretty Boy Shaw,
he's no fucking dolly mixture.

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.994
He's an ex-pro.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:16.158
So you, you cheeky lump,
are going to have to learn to box.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.549
Give us a cuddle.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.310
Come on, give us a cuddle.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.592
You're sticking your chin out
past your guard.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.399
What is the point of having it there

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:40.877
if you are going to stick your chin
out past your fist? It's here.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.310
See this apple.

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.040
I ain't fucking hungry, John John.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.800
I want you to put this apple under your chin.

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:48.549
Go on.

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.393
That's it, that's it. Fuck.

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.870
You need to hold it in,
hold it in with your right hand,

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.111
There, you're covering the button.

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.356
Box on.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:57.510
You're gonna throw that right.

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.071
You better put your chin right down,
otherwise you're going to lose your apple.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.112
Go on, Lenny. Get it down.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.192
Throw a right, throw a right, two rounds.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.839
Oh, that's it.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.236
Time.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.396
Go on, get a drink of water.

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:20.836
And again.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.276
Oh, feel that.

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.993
Slip it, slip it.

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:36.870
Slip it, slip it, that's it.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.155
That's it, don't lean in, don't lean in,

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.913
You're spinning.
What you're doing is leaning in.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.440
Time, time, time!

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.156
Time!

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:49.592
Oi, gloves down.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.152
Morning Len, you're up early, ain't you, son?

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:04.876
You alright?

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.113
What you got for me, then?

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.599
What's she worth to you?

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:14.949
I tell you what, it's only worth a carpet,
but today's your lucky day, Len.

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:16.276
I'll give you a monkey for it.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.710
I'll tell you what.

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:24.315
That's for you, alright?

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.240
Good boy.

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.313
Charlie, throw a bucket of water over it

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.596
and stick it on the front
for a bag of sand, will you?

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.070
Here he is.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:06.600
Alright.

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:10.759
Just lemonade please, Ethel.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.160
Lemonade?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.560
It's, er... For the damage I caused.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:26.313
No, you're alright, son,
I don't hold grudges.

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.239
You take that, Reenie.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.995
My nut's clear now.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:33.439
I took some liberties in here.

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.193
Oh, where's... Where's Douglas Haig, then?

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.599
I had him stuffed, Lenny.

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.557
He passed on Friday week.

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:55.914
Natural causes.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.118
Reenie found him in bed

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:03.114
with Bobbie Sunlight
hanging out the back of him.

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:07.515
Oh, nothing untoward, mind.

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.114
That's too bad.

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:12.956
Why are you wobbling like an old chimp?

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.517
I am in training again, Leslie.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.190
Oh?

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.073
Worth a flutter, are you?

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:25.671
Back your life on me, Leslie,
back your life on me.

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:29.192
Oh, there's not a lot of life left to back.

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:35.314
Leslie, you've been saying that for a decade.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.152
You want to go
and make it right with Carrots.

01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.080
Well.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.958
I suppose it was an apology.

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:04.835
Sort of.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:12.432
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the rematch you've all been waiting for.</i>

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:18.830
<i>The unlicensed boxing heavyweight</i>
<i>championship of the world.</i>

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.880
Thanks, pet.

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:29.873
Come on, Len.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.236
Alright?

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.954
Where are those weapons, boy?

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.839
Here, these gloves are the business,
much better, much better.

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.319
You remember what we trained?

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.436
Right.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.836
You show him the left,
you don't throw him the left.

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.718
You move but you don't lead.

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.634
You throw the right,
you don't throw yourself in with it.

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.873
When he comes in close,
you squeeze the air out of him.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.112
You push him into the ground,
you soak a few up in the stomach.

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.954
You're good down there,
and you put him on the ground.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.392
And this time, you make sure
he doesn't get up.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.195
Good boy, son.

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.600
Hello, boy.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.915
All grown up and doing a turn, hey?

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:20.231
Famous now, I bet you're
a bit flush, ain't ya, hey?

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.271
Looking after the family?

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.116
What?

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.998
I should have slung him out the window
when I had a fair chance.

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:40.433
You'll lose tonight.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:44.796
What are you going to do, Lenny, hey?

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.557
Bite my throat out like you did
to your cousin, Carrots?

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.035
You're a gutless coward.

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:54.274
I know what you did.

01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:57.910
I know what you did to the family.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:05.712
It was me. Me, who made Lenny who he is, Val,

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.077
and you'll thank me if he wins tonight.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.198
My Lenny don't drink no more.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:17.837
But the day that you fucking die,
I am going to go and buy him a shandy.

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.396
Couldn't do much for his brother,
though, could he, eh?

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.917
You're nothing to me, Jim.

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.314
You hear me?

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.358
You are nothing to me.

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.115
Look at me.

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:41.120
Look at me.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.670
Look at me.

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:50.355
Now, you get out of this room before you
make me break my promise to my mum.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.600
You alright, Len?

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:13.555
Yeah.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.632
Of course, I'm alright.

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:17.919
I'm Daddy Cool.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:27.156
Good boy, son.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.630
- Let's put on a show, hey?
- Yeah.

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:34.556
Oh.

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.798
Come on, boy, we don't want
to keep Shawy waiting.

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:43.876
No, no, no, let's give him a minute.
Let him think I've bottled out.

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.594
Yeah.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:49.636
If that leg flares up,
I'm throwin' the towel in, right?

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.954
Let's give Shawy his Gary Glitter moment.

01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:02.672
<i>Ladies and gentlemen. And in the blue corner</i>

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.151
<i>still the Guv'nor,</i>

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:10.759
<i>Roy "Pretty Boy" Shaw.</i>

01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:18.091
Come on, Lenny. You're on.

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.990
Open the fucking door for me. Come on.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.956
<i>Come on, Len, ready? Come on, boy.</i>

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.599
<i>Right and shut him up once and for all.</i>

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.640
<i>Out of Hoxton,</i>

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.630
<i>Lenny "The Boy" McLean.</i>

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.349
Come on, Lenny.

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:12.909
Come on, Len.

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.198
Come on, Len.

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:39.876
Come on, Len.

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.553
<i>I've made him into a man.</i>

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:55.116
<i>I'm doing it for his own benefit.</i>

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:37.280
Lenny, Lenny!

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.593
Who's the Guv'nor?

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.073
Who's the Guv'nor?

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.114
I'm the Guv'nor.

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.757
I'm the Guv'nor.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.000
Who's the Guv'nor?

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:03.240
I'm the Guv'nor, I'm the Guv'nor.

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.232
I'm the Guv'nor.

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.951
<i>I'm the Guv'nor.</i>

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:24.314
You've got to fight to get anywhere,
you know, if you don't fight you're just

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:26.716
one of the crowd, and one of the crowd
don't get nothing.

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:30.236
So I started off as a kid, fighting.

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:34.311
And I was the best when I was a kid.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.514
And I wanna be the best, now.
