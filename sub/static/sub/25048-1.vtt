and that's all that matters.

what he can't have.

15:03.523 --> 15:04.523
Baby?

15:09.287 --> 15:10.288
Matt?

15:15.466 --> 15:16.466
Babe?

15:23.025 --> 15:24.958
[growling]

15:38.075 --> 15:40.008

[growling]

15:51.088 --> 15:53.021
[Brienne screams]

15:56.990 --> 15:59.096
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

15:59.130 --> 16:00.156
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

16:00.166 --> 16:03.238
- It sounded like Brie.
- Brie? What..

16:03.272 --> 16:04.539
- Where the hell are they?
- Aah!

16:04.549 --> 16:06.344
Oh, shit.

16:09.899 --> 16:11.832
- Oh, my God. What was that?
- I don't know.

16:15.698 --> 16:17.528
- Shit! Who's this?
- Who..

16:17.562 --> 16:19.288
- Shit!
- Brie!

16:19.323 --> 16:20.876
Fuck!

16:20.910 --> 16:21.910
What happened to her?

16:22.774 --> 16:24.362
She's alive.

16:26.054 --> 16:27.020
We need to get her
to the hospital.

16:27.055 --> 16:28.263
Get her to the hospital?

16:28.297 --> 16:29.323
We're in the middle
of fucking nowhere!

16:29.333 --> 16:30.807
Well, there has to be
a ranger station

16:30.817 --> 16:31.783
around here, right?

16:31.818 --> 16:32.853
I don't know!

16:32.888 --> 16:34.131
Oh, God.

16:34.165 --> 16:35.995
Oh, my God. What happened?

16:36.029 --> 16:37.479
Oh, my God.

16:37.513 --> 16:39.446
Looks like an animal
got to her or something.

16:39.481 --> 16:41.724
Hey, Brie. Brie, Brie,
Brie, Brie, Brie.

16:41.759 --> 16:43.381
Can you hear me?

16:44.865 --> 16:46.453
Oh, my God.

16:48.214 --> 16:49.387
Is she dead?

16:49.422 --> 16:50.388
[dramatic music]

16:50.423 --> 16:51.803
Oh, my God!

16:51.838 --> 16:54.772
[both whimpering]

16:58.189 --> 16:59.189
[retching]

17:00.881 --> 17:02.469
Slowly. Okay.

17:03.505 --> 17:05.679
- Okay. Here we go.
- Okay.

17:05.714 --> 17:08.510
Brie? Brie?

17:09.579 --> 17:11.961
- Okay.
- Here.

17:11.996 --> 17:13.411
Okay.

17:13.445 --> 17:14.791
Come on.

17:19.071 --> 17:20.315
Oh, shit.

17:20.348 --> 17:22.144
[crying]

17:24.284 --> 17:26.906
I think Matt has some medical
supplies in his backpack.

17:26.942 --> 17:28.243
What're you gonna do? Put some
fuckin' Band-Aids on her?

17:28.253 --> 17:29.393
We have to do something.

17:29.427 --> 17:31.119
Do you want to just let her die?

17:31.153 --> 17:33.086
Go get the supplies, please.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.574
Hey, Brie.

17:39.506 --> 17:41.439
I'm right here, okay?

17:42.785 --> 17:44.615
I'm not gonna leave you.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.171
What if whatever did this
is still out there?

17:49.206 --> 17:51.139
And what if it comes back?

17:54.038 --> 17:55.038
Fuck!

18:01.804 --> 18:02.805
Hey.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.002
She doing okay?

18:07.369 --> 18:09.709
Look, I'm just gonna
stay with her all night

18:09.743 --> 18:12.436
so you just go sleep in Matt
and Brie's tent tonight, okay?

18:15.508 --> 18:16.508
Yeah.

18:17.406 --> 18:18.683
Yeah, okay.

18:26.760 --> 18:30.316
Jesse, I'm scared.

18:33.077 --> 18:34.354
It'll be okay.

18:36.045 --> 18:37.495
Promise?

18:40.498 --> 18:41.982
Promise.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.195
Can you hold me?

18:50.681 --> 18:52.614
[instrumental music]

19:03.487 --> 19:04.971
[flies buzzing]

19:10.770 --> 19:12.496
[birds cawing]

19:12.530 --> 19:14.532
[flies buzzing]

19:16.016 --> 19:17.017
[bones cracking]

19:20.331 --> 19:22.264
[birds chirping]

19:28.477 --> 19:30.238
How far is it?

19:30.272 --> 19:32.309
Just up the wash.
Anyone else hurt?

19:32.343 --> 19:34.173
Can everybody walk?

19:34.207 --> 19:35.243
Let me get this straight.

19:35.277 --> 19:37.348
Where exactly were you heading?

19:38.142 --> 19:40.420
Some lake.

19:40.455 --> 19:42.008
[indistinct]

19:42.042 --> 19:43.458
Why'd do you stop here though?

19:43.492 --> 19:45.425
Well, Matt got us lost.

19:46.219 --> 19:47.910
Who's this?

19:47.945 --> 19:49.025
Alice, this is Bill Talbot.

19:49.049 --> 19:50.430
He's got a cabin nearby.

19:50.465 --> 19:52.294
I heard about your friend.

19:52.329 --> 19:54.158
I'm sorry for your loss.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.712
How is she?

19:56.747 --> 19:58.645
She's stable.

19:58.680 --> 20:01.407
I have medical supplies.
Food, water.

20:01.441 --> 20:03.374
So we can take her
to your cabin.

20:06.308 --> 20:08.276
The sooner the better, I'd say.

20:13.591 --> 20:16.525
Hey, uh, do you -- do you have
phone service here?

20:18.182 --> 20:20.184
Not out here, sweetie.
Solitude is my neighbor.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.323
Shit.

20:21.358 --> 20:23.152
Well, there..

20:23.187 --> 20:25.638
I mean, there has to be like
a ranger station, right?

20:27.467 --> 20:30.229
I moved out here six years ago
to get away from all that.

20:31.678 --> 20:33.853
Get away from people.

20:33.887 --> 20:35.924
Nearest human being
is 50 miles away.

20:37.305 --> 20:38.789
I mean,
you know this forest, do..

20:38.823 --> 20:40.791
Do you know what,
what did this to her?

20:41.619 --> 20:43.656
A bear, maybe.

20:45.140 --> 20:46.624
God!

20:46.659 --> 20:47.625
All right, sweetie.

20:47.660 --> 20:48.626
We're here.

20:48.661 --> 20:50.249
Let's get her inside.

20:51.871 --> 20:53.735
[birds cawing]

20:55.288 --> 20:58.015
Somebody needs to hike back
and get some help.

20:58.049 --> 21:00.880
I'll go. But I should go
with somebody.

21:00.914 --> 21:03.227
I-I need to stay with Brie.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.953
I.. I can go.

21:06.920 --> 21:10.510
Okay, fine. Uh, what's
the quickest way back?

21:10.545 --> 21:12.892
Well, down that trail
right there

21:12.926 --> 21:15.446
it's 20 miles to a service road.

21:15.481 --> 21:18.001
Once you're on that, it'll take
you directly to the parking lot.

21:19.036 --> 21:20.175
All right.

21:20.209 --> 21:21.408
If we manage four miles an hour

21:21.418 --> 21:22.764
we should get back
before sundown.

21:22.798 --> 21:24.317
- Okay.
- Let's go.

21:24.352 --> 21:25.663
Jesse, wait.

21:27.113 --> 21:29.046
- Hurry back, okay?
- Take care of yourself too.

21:32.532 --> 21:35.017
Stay on the trail.

21:35.052 --> 21:36.985
[instrumental music]

21:50.930 --> 21:52.034
Just try and keep up, okay?

21:52.069 --> 21:54.002
[panting]

21:59.559 --> 22:01.181
It's so beautiful.

22:04.046 --> 22:05.979
[sobbing]
We were gonna be married.

22:09.293 --> 22:11.226
Honey, I'm so sorry.

22:12.814 --> 22:16.473
[sobbing]
I don't want to live anymore.

22:16.507 --> 22:19.407
No. No, no, no.
Don't, don't say that.

22:20.649 --> 22:21.961
I don't.

22:27.622 --> 22:28.726
I don't understand. I..

22:29.658 --> 22:31.798
He was..
He was right here.

22:39.875 --> 22:42.222
Maybe, maybe a wild animal
dragged him off or something?

22:42.257 --> 22:43.258
No, no, no.

22:43.292 --> 22:46.295
A bear usually leaves
the carcass

22:46.330 --> 22:47.952
comes back to it.

22:47.987 --> 22:51.611
Mountain lion might drag it off
and hide it, but..

22:51.646 --> 22:53.958
He didn't just get up
and walk away.

23:05.245 --> 23:06.937
[intense music]

23:13.702 --> 23:16.429
[birds cawing]

23:22.780 --> 23:24.713
Hey, do you think we're close?

23:26.232 --> 23:27.233
Hey!

23:28.061 --> 23:29.442
Jesse.

23:43.111 --> 23:45.631
[panting]
How is she?

23:45.665 --> 23:46.666
I don't -- I don't know.

23:46.701 --> 23:48.634
You need to come see
for yourself.

24:25.567 --> 24:27.051
What the hell?

24:34.680 --> 24:36.509
That's weird.

24:36.544 --> 24:38.373
It's disgusting.

24:38.407 --> 24:40.686
What, you never seen
a dead animal before?

24:40.720 --> 24:42.826
Only on your girlfriend.

24:42.860 --> 24:44.379
Very funny.

24:45.691 --> 24:48.383
Why would anyone do this?

24:48.417 --> 24:50.212
Why're you asking me?

24:50.247 --> 24:51.756
You know, you're Mr. Outdoors,
aren't you?

24:51.766 --> 24:53.205
Does it look like
I would hang a dead rabbit

24:53.215 --> 24:55.148
from a fucking tree?

24:56.564 --> 24:59.187
You don't like me very much,
do you?

24:59.221 --> 25:01.845
- Honestly, no.
- Why?

25:01.879 --> 25:04.917
- Why? Be -- because of Alice?
- Yeah, that is why.

25:04.951 --> 25:06.884
She's gay, dude.

25:06.919 --> 25:09.508
All right, you've got
to get over that.

25:09.542 --> 25:12.027
Well, that's just
fucking bullshit, okay?

25:12.062 --> 25:13.201
I know her.

25:13.235 --> 25:14.409
She's just going through some

25:14.443 --> 25:15.721
some crazy dyke phase.

25:15.755 --> 25:17.999
- Excuse me?
- You fuckin' heard me.

25:18.033 --> 25:19.552
Yo, fuck you.

25:19.587 --> 25:22.003
[screaming]

25:22.037 --> 25:23.522
Oh, my God!
God, I'm so sorry.

25:23.556 --> 25:24.592
[Jesse screaming]

25:24.626 --> 25:25.696
Oh, fuck!

25:25.731 --> 25:26.697
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

25:26.732 --> 25:28.699
Fuck! Get it off me.

25:28.734 --> 25:31.184
Shit.
Shit! Are you okay?

25:31.219 --> 25:33.633
Fuck, no. My fucking
foot is in this bear trap.

25:33.644 --> 25:34.750
Okay. All right.

25:34.774 --> 25:35.810
Goddammit!

25:35.844 --> 25:36.735
[screaming]

25:36.751 --> 25:37.835
Fuck!

25:37.846 --> 25:39.192
It fuckin' hurts.

25:39.227 --> 25:40.953
It's fuckin'..
What the fuck is this thing?

25:40.987 --> 25:42.047
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Get it off of me.

25:42.057 --> 25:43.117
- Ready? Ready?
- Okay, one..

25:43.127 --> 25:44.094
- One..
- One..

25:44.128 --> 25:45.785
Two.. Three!

25:45.820 --> 25:46.786
[Jesse grunting]

25:46.821 --> 25:48.640
- Oh, my God!
- Three!

[screams]

25:53.241 --> 25:54.241
[sighs]

26:04.563 --> 26:05.840
How is she?

26:09.429 --> 26:12.156
Uh, she's sleeping right now.

26:14.883 --> 26:16.782
Is she gonna make it?

26:19.025 --> 26:20.440
I don't know.

26:22.857 --> 26:24.306
[sighs]

26:24.341 --> 26:26.101
You look exhausted.

26:26.136 --> 26:27.586
I'm fine.

26:32.487 --> 26:34.006
Is this your wife?

26:35.421 --> 26:36.698
That's my wife.

26:37.803 --> 26:38.803
Was.

26:40.668 --> 26:42.601
She passed a while back.

26:43.671 --> 26:45.396
I'm so sorry.

26:46.570 --> 26:47.985
It's okay.

26:50.298 --> 26:52.300
I got a lotta
good memories up here.

26:56.580 --> 26:58.409
Yeah, it's a real Disney World.

27:04.450 --> 27:05.520
[both grunting]

27:05.554 --> 27:07.142
- Fuck! Oh!
- Ah!

27:07.177 --> 27:08.350
One more time. One more time.

27:08.385 --> 27:09.618
- Okay, one more time.
- Fuck, it hurts!

27:09.628 --> 27:10.939
- Ready?
- Shit!

27:10.974 --> 27:11.940
Shit. Okay.

27:11.975 --> 27:13.148
- Fuck you.
- Ready?

27:13.183 --> 27:16.462
- Okay. Okay, okay.
- One, two..

27:16.496 --> 27:17.463
- Three!

27:19.741 --> 27:22.261

- All right!

27:22.295 --> 27:23.262
Ready? I'm gonna try
one more time.

27:23.296 --> 27:24.391
- One more time.
- Oh, no, no, no!

27:24.401 --> 27:25.816
- Go get help.
- I'll try again.

27:25.851 --> 27:27.428
- I'm gonna try again. Okay?
- You gotta go. No.

27:27.438 --> 27:28.533
- You gotta go back.
- I'm gonna try one more time.

27:28.543 --> 27:30.303
You got to go back
and you gotta get help.

27:30.338 --> 27:31.709
You got to fuckin' go back
and get help.

27:31.719 --> 27:32.685
Okay.

27:32.720 --> 27:33.686
Okay.

27:33.721 --> 27:35.032
Um..

27:35.067 --> 27:37.000
Just, just don't move.

27:39.796 --> 27:40.900
[sighing]

27:40.935 --> 27:42.005
Oh, fuck!

Shit!

[breathing heavily]

27:50.807 --> 27:52.291
Alice?

27:53.637 --> 27:54.638
Yeah?

27:56.433 --> 27:58.573
I didn't mean
what I said before.

28:00.471 --> 28:02.404
I don't wanna die.

28:03.854 --> 28:06.477
[sniffling]
Am I going to die, Alice?

28:06.512 --> 28:09.204
You are not gonna die.

28:10.999 --> 28:11.999
Okay?

28:14.589 --> 28:15.970
[dramatic music]

28:17.454 --> 28:18.731
Sun's setting.

28:20.215 --> 28:22.175
Do you think they made it back
to the cars by now?

28:23.598 --> 28:25.186
They should have.

28:27.257 --> 28:29.224
Good. I want to go home.

28:35.058 --> 28:37.163
How's she doing?

28:37.198 --> 28:39.372
It's spreading more rapidly now.

28:42.065 --> 28:43.411
She's dying.

28:45.033 --> 28:46.310
What?

28:48.209 --> 28:49.209
Nothin'.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.596
I'm gonna turn in for the night.

28:56.631 --> 28:58.840
There's blankets in the back.

28:58.875 --> 29:00.014
Make yourselves comfortable.

29:01.843 --> 29:03.258
Get some rest.

29:03.293 --> 29:04.570
Thank you.

29:08.229 --> 29:09.817
I don't trust him.

29:11.508 --> 29:12.474
[door closes]

29:12.509 --> 29:13.509
Why?

29:14.683 --> 29:16.030
I don't know. I..

29:16.064 --> 29:17.894
I just don't trust him.

29:20.620 --> 29:22.864
[exhales]
We should..

29:22.899 --> 29:24.693
We should check on Brie
every couple hours.

29:24.728 --> 29:26.972
Let's just take shifts sleeping.

29:27.006 --> 29:29.422
I'm wide awake,
so you should get some shut-eye.

29:30.078 --> 29:31.562
Yeah?

29:31.597 --> 29:33.116
Yeah, you need it.

29:34.255 --> 29:35.255
[sighing]

29:39.122 --> 29:40.330

29:43.920 --> 29:45.887
I wish I was strong like you.

[scoffs]

29:49.166 --> 29:50.858
I'm not strong.

29:54.413 --> 29:55.690
Yeah, you are.

29:58.935 --> 30:00.384
I'm not strong.

Seriously?

30:30.898 --> 30:32.037

[exhales]

31:23.226 --> 31:25.331
Please don't be a coyote.

Hey!

33:30.284 --> 33:32.113
Alice?

33:32.148 --> 33:33.459
What're you doing?

33:35.047 --> 33:37.291
I'm just..
I'm just checkin' on her.

33:38.982 --> 33:41.881
- What is that?
- This?

33:41.916 --> 33:44.643
This is, uh, antibiotics.

33:44.677 --> 33:45.782
I thought it might help.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.335
Bullshit!

33:47.370 --> 33:50.511
- What's in the syringe?
- What's going on?

33:52.202 --> 33:54.085
- Trust me.
- I don't trust you.

33:54.132 --> 33:55.240
[gun cocks]

33:55.274 --> 33:57.207
You back the fuck off!

33:57.794 --> 33:59.037
Now!

34:03.041 --> 34:04.318
I have no choice.

34:04.352 --> 34:05.884
- I have to do this.
- Aah!

34:48.534 --> 34:51.018
Jesus. Alice, I can't believe
you fucking shot him.

34:51.054 --> 34:52.435
He'll live.

34:55.851 --> 34:57.785
What do you think
he was doing in there?

34:59.614 --> 35:01.513
I don't know.

35:01.547 --> 35:03.480
I'm gonna find out
when he wakes up.

35:04.723 --> 35:05.723
[coughs]

35:07.691 --> 35:09.624
[distant shrieking]

35:10.315 --> 35:11.592
What was that?

35:16.735 --> 35:18.633
[growling]

35:18.668 --> 35:19.669
I'm gonna go outside.

35:19.703 --> 35:21.222
No, you can't
leave me in here alone.

35:21.257 --> 35:24.156
Just keep an eye on him.

35:24.191 --> 35:26.124
I don't know what to do
with this.

35:27.815 --> 35:30.645
Gina.. Business end.
The trigger.

35:30.680 --> 35:33.648
- It's really easy.
- Okay.

35:33.683 --> 35:35.374
What do I do if he wakes up?

35:35.409 --> 35:37.652
You shoot him in the leg, Gina.

35:39.896 --> 35:41.035
I'll be right back.

36:32.466 --> 36:33.743
[groans]

[laughing]

36:35.952 --> 36:38.299
You..

36:38.334 --> 36:40.267
What, are you gonna shoot me?

36:41.751 --> 36:43.339
You have no idea.

36:43.373 --> 36:45.306
You don't understand
what's coming.

36:46.583 --> 36:49.690
Your friend has been infected
with the virus.

36:49.724 --> 36:51.933
It's taken over her body.

36:53.245 --> 36:54.902
She'll die soon.

36:56.869 --> 36:59.494
And she's gonna turn
into something.

36:59.505 --> 37:01.822
- Something that's not your friend.
- What?

37:01.833 --> 37:04.062
- Something terrible.
- What are you talking about?

37:04.073 --> 37:06.500
You've gotta go in there
and kill her.

37:06.534 --> 37:09.503
- What?
- Our lives are in danger.

37:09.537 --> 37:12.195
You gotta go in there
and put a bullet in her head.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.818
- Shut up!
- You gotta go do this!

37:14.853 --> 37:16.337
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Go in there --

37:16.372 --> 37:18.270
- You gotta go there and do this!
- Shut up!

[exhaling deeply]

37:52.200 --> 37:53.719
Why didn't you shoot him?

37:56.998 --> 37:59.242
I don't think he's
coming back anytime soon.

38:10.253 --> 38:12.683
He said Brienne was dangerous.

38:13.187 --> 38:15.223
He's crazy, Gina.

38:23.572 --> 38:25.432
What are you doing?

38:25.797 --> 38:28.737
- Looking.
- For what?

38:30.417 --> 38:32.549
I don't know.

38:36.624 --> 38:38.385
Did you hear that?

38:39.075 --> 38:40.697
Hear what?

[metal clinking]

38:47.716 --> 38:49.304

38:57.058 --> 39:00.160
- Okay.
- Can -- can you move that?

[grunts]

39:08.104 --> 39:09.692
[dramatic music]

39:12.902 --> 39:14.904
Where does that go?

39:16.630 --> 39:18.528
Only one way to find out.

39:20.668 --> 39:22.049
[grunting]

39:25.155 --> 39:26.536
What the fuck?

39:27.951 --> 39:32.231
It's like a cellar or something.

39:32.266 --> 39:34.199
Hand me that lantern.

39:42.725 --> 39:45.521
- I'm gonna go down.
- There's no way I'm going down there.

39:47.695 --> 39:49.352
Suit yourself.

39:58.223 --> 39:59.569
Hey, wait up.

40:02.572 --> 40:04.678
[floorboard creaking]

40:12.755 --> 40:14.688
It's really dark down here.

40:29.047 --> 40:31.429
Jesus Christ. What is this?

40:34.673 --> 40:36.261
I don't know.

40:38.505 --> 40:40.438
What do you think?

40:45.719 --> 40:48.169
I think Talbot's not
what he seems.

40:55.694 --> 40:58.179
Jesus. You think he's like
a serial killer?

40:58.214 --> 40:59.629
"Ketamine?"

41:01.113 --> 41:03.046
This is horse tranquilizer.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.705
Oh, we use this on our mares.

41:08.880 --> 41:11.572
There's about enough
to knock out a dozen here.

41:14.402 --> 41:16.819
Yeah, well..

41:16.853 --> 41:19.684
Something tells me he's not
playing My Little Pony.

41:31.523 --> 41:33.663
I think he kept
someone prisoner here.

41:36.563 --> 41:39.635
By the looks of it,
for a really long time.

41:50.404 --> 41:52.371
What is this?

41:52.406 --> 41:53.994
[knocking on door]

41:56.099 --> 41:57.963
[knocking on door]

Is it Talbot?

42:01.622 --> 42:03.037
Where's the gun?

Oh, shit!

Who is it? Answer me!

42:17.431 --> 42:19.122

42:19.157 --> 42:22.056
Please just open
the fucking door!

42:22.091 --> 42:23.471
Jules?

42:26.820 --> 42:28.684
- I almost shot you.
- Oh, my God.

42:28.718 --> 42:30.409
Hey, hey..

42:30.444 --> 42:32.411
What are you doing.. What..
Where's Jesse?

42:33.551 --> 42:35.000
Oh, my God, Alice,
it's really bad.

42:35.035 --> 42:37.244
- It's really fucking bad!
- Hey-hey-hey.

42:37.278 --> 42:39.349
Calm down. What happened?

42:40.419 --> 42:41.938
Where's Jesse?

Oh, shit!

[screaming]

43:55.909 --> 43:58.739
What do we do now?

43:58.774 --> 44:01.880
Okay, look,
we wait until the morning.

44:01.915 --> 44:04.469
No, we can't wait until morning.
Jesse could die out there.

44:04.503 --> 44:07.230
It's not gonna help anybody
if the rescue team gets lost

44:07.265 --> 44:09.819
or if it runs into the thing
that she's talking about.

44:12.442 --> 44:13.754
Okay.

44:15.100 --> 44:17.171
Jules, you can take me there.

44:18.966 --> 44:21.072
Gina, you stay with Brie.

44:27.872 --> 44:30.184
[intense music]

45:07.290 --> 45:08.326
[grunts]

45:09.741 --> 45:11.432
Hey, we should be back
before dark.

45:11.467 --> 45:13.262
- Okay?
- Okay.

45:13.296 --> 45:14.539
And then what?

45:16.437 --> 45:17.853
We'll stay the night.

45:17.887 --> 45:21.097
And I'll hike up to the cars
in the morning.

45:22.133 --> 45:23.410
Then I'll drive and get help.

45:23.444 --> 45:26.102
And we'll get the hell
out of here.

45:26.137 --> 45:28.070
- Okay.
- We'll be right back.

45:29.450 --> 45:30.866
[grunts]

45:30.900 --> 45:32.833
[dramatic music]

45:56.098 --> 45:59.411
We're gonna get outta this
together, okay?

46:05.861 --> 46:07.172
Ah!

46:08.953 --> 46:10.541
Ah!

46:14.702 --> 46:15.738
Ah!

46:16.808 --> 46:18.430
[groaning]

46:19.397 --> 46:21.330
[gasping]

46:34.170 --> 46:35.931
- He's right there.
- What?

46:35.965 --> 46:38.899
Jesse! I got Alice.

46:38.934 --> 46:40.383
Is he okay? Jesse.

46:40.418 --> 46:42.075
Oh, my God!

46:42.109 --> 46:43.317
Oh, God.

46:44.403 --> 46:46.345
It looks like he got attacked
by a wild animal.

46:46.355 --> 46:48.736
- Alice, this is my fault!
- No. No, it is not.

46:48.771 --> 46:50.186
It is not your fault.

46:50.221 --> 46:51.861
I pushed him.
I shouldn't have pushed him.

46:51.878 --> 46:54.639
It was an accident, Jules, okay?

46:54.673 --> 46:56.227
Okay?

47:03.579 --> 47:05.581
- He's not dead.
- What?

47:06.893 --> 47:08.377
Wait, wait, what?

47:08.411 --> 47:12.174
I mean, he's not breathing,
but he has a faint pulse.

47:12.208 --> 47:14.141
We need to get him back
to the cabin.

47:16.074 --> 47:18.697
Yeah -- yeah, but, um,
how do we get this thing off?

47:18.732 --> 47:20.734
I tried and it's,
it's too freakin' strong.

47:20.768 --> 47:23.288
That's why I brought these.

47:23.323 --> 47:24.634
Where did you get those?

47:24.669 --> 47:26.602
Swiped them from the cabin.

47:28.397 --> 47:30.054
How do you know how to do this?

47:30.088 --> 47:32.366
I used to set traps with my dad.

47:33.609 --> 47:35.473
Nothing this big though.

47:35.507 --> 47:37.578
You scare me sometimes.

47:38.338 --> 47:39.753
Ah, it's working.

47:40.409 --> 47:43.032
[panting]

47:51.213 --> 47:53.629
- Don't go so fast.
- Okay, okay, I'll slow down.

47:55.803 --> 47:56.977
Be careful.

47:59.566 --> 48:01.533
Wait, wait, wait.

48:01.568 --> 48:03.397
- I need a break.
- Okay.

48:03.432 --> 48:05.399
- Right here, right here.
- Okay.

48:05.434 --> 48:07.056
- Ready?
- Yeah.

48:07.091 --> 48:08.609
[grunts]

48:10.439 --> 48:11.439
Oh, my..

48:17.687 --> 48:18.930
[sighs]
Ah.

48:24.556 --> 48:26.144
You'd be a good doctor.

48:27.628 --> 48:29.113
Yeah? Why's that?

48:30.804 --> 48:32.185
I don't know, you're just..

48:33.807 --> 48:36.051
You're wired to save things.
You know, you're just..

48:38.087 --> 48:41.539
I bet you were the type of kid
that saved kittens.

48:42.333 --> 48:43.955
[chuckles]

48:43.990 --> 48:45.267
Yeah.

48:46.958 --> 48:49.996
Ah! It's funny coming
from a family of hunters.

48:51.100 --> 48:52.205
Really?

48:53.931 --> 48:55.794
Yeah.

48:55.829 --> 48:59.833
I mean, when I was little,
my dad held the moon, you know?

49:01.939 --> 49:04.872
And he was a hunter, so I guess
I wanted to be a hunter too.

49:07.323 --> 49:10.706
And he was an army ranger
and he was really

49:10.740 --> 49:13.847
weird about his guns,
he'd never let me hold them.

49:16.194 --> 49:19.301
And I remember, one day

49:19.335 --> 49:21.855
after begging him so much

49:21.889 --> 49:23.822
he finally gave in.

49:25.376 --> 49:28.275
He showed me
how to hold the weapon.

49:28.310 --> 49:29.897
How to aim it.

49:31.692 --> 49:33.936
That day I shot my first rabbit.

49:35.800 --> 49:38.078
Ew, that's, that's gross.

49:38.113 --> 49:41.840
No, I was excited.
A hunter like my dad.

49:44.809 --> 49:45.983
Except that..

49:47.191 --> 49:50.125
...my rabbit was still alive.

49:53.507 --> 49:54.992
That's terrible.

49:57.408 --> 49:59.168
I'll never forget the look
on its face.

50:04.070 --> 50:06.900
I think after that
I gave up hunting

50:06.934 --> 50:10.317
and I, uh, took on soccer.

50:12.078 --> 50:13.596
[scoffs]

50:13.631 --> 50:14.977
And girls.

50:16.289 --> 50:17.600
And girls.

50:24.124 --> 50:27.852
I think I'm gonna go
and see my dad when we get back.

50:30.889 --> 50:32.822
I owe him the truth, you know?

50:37.793 --> 50:40.037
[instrumental music]

50:40.071 --> 50:42.004
[birds chirping]

51:12.655 --> 51:14.243
Brienne settled in.

51:15.831 --> 51:17.764
How's he doing?

51:19.214 --> 51:21.664
I don't know.

51:21.699 --> 51:25.323
His whole body seems to be
in some sorta deep sleep.

51:25.358 --> 51:27.084
Like a coma.

51:28.358 --> 51:30.121
I mean, his heart rate's
barely there.

51:30.156 --> 51:32.365
He's not responsive to light.

51:32.399 --> 51:34.263
He could be brain-dead
for all I know.

51:34.298 --> 51:36.162
Well, you're the expert
on viruses

51:36.196 --> 51:38.578
so what are we
dealing with here?

51:38.612 --> 51:41.051
Well, I'm not an expert.

51:41.719 --> 51:45.412
But this virus, it appears
to be transmitted by a scratch

51:45.447 --> 51:47.276
or a bite of an infected animal.

51:47.311 --> 51:49.658
We have to get them
to the hospital.

51:49.692 --> 51:51.694
We can't go now,
it's about to be dark.

51:53.869 --> 51:55.802
We'll wait until the morning.

52:02.602 --> 52:04.535
[instrumental music]

52:05.467 --> 52:07.400
I'm gonna stay with Jesse.

52:08.918 --> 52:10.023
Yeah.

52:24.624 --> 52:26.833
[sighs]
I feel so helpless.

52:30.595 --> 52:33.529
You did all that you could.

52:33.564 --> 52:36.256
Now, you get some rest
and I'll take over.

52:36.291 --> 52:38.534
I'm okay.

52:38.569 --> 52:41.123
You have to start trusting
people, Alice.

52:42.331 --> 52:45.092
Besides, you have a long hike
in the morning.

52:51.754 --> 52:52.754
Okay.

53:06.252 --> 53:08.185
[instrumental music]

53:36.178 --> 53:39.112
[intense music]

[floorboard creaking]

54:32.683 --> 54:33.787
[dramatic music]

54:35.099 --> 54:37.032
You shoulda listened to me.

54:38.447 --> 54:40.380
What do you want from us?

54:41.416 --> 54:43.349
You can't leave here now.

54:44.557 --> 54:46.283
What are you gonna do..

54:46.317 --> 54:48.388
Kill us?

54:48.423 --> 54:50.597
I have to protect my family.

54:53.566 --> 54:56.741
I thought that you said
that your wife was dead.

54:56.776 --> 54:59.088
I'm not talkin' about my wife.

55:02.057 --> 55:04.024
I'm talkin' about my son.

55:05.612 --> 55:06.958
Your son?

55:20.455 --> 55:21.697
Jesse?

55:26.530 --> 55:27.979
Jesse.

55:42.131 --> 55:43.719

Jesse?

Jesse?

[groaning]

57:01.970 --> 57:02.970
Aah!

57:04.869 --> 57:06.802
- You got this?
- I got this. Go.

57:09.011 --> 57:10.910

57:35.900 --> 57:38.144
[breathing heavily]

57:38.178 --> 57:40.111
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

58:01.132 --> 58:03.549
What happened to Jesse?

58:03.583 --> 58:05.930
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

58:08.795 --> 58:11.522
You better start talking
or I'm gonna put a bullet

58:11.557 --> 58:13.490
through your fucking skull.

58:14.801 --> 58:15.975
Now!

58:18.805 --> 58:20.807
It's a virus.

58:20.842 --> 58:23.430
Like rabies, only much worse.

58:23.465 --> 58:24.777
That thing that attacked you

58:24.811 --> 58:26.848
your first night
at the campsite..

58:29.885 --> 58:32.819
That was Ben, my son.

58:35.270 --> 58:38.894
- You bullshit.
- He has the Feral virus.

58:38.929 --> 58:40.862
And now your friends do too.

58:42.657 --> 58:44.382
I kept him..

58:45.487 --> 58:47.178
...locked up in the cellar.

58:47.213 --> 58:50.630
Chained and sedated so that
he wouldn't harm anyone.

58:50.665 --> 58:52.494
That I could study him

58:52.529 --> 58:53.909
and maybe find a cure.

58:53.944 --> 58:56.705
But, he escaped.

58:56.740 --> 58:59.156
[grunting]

59:01.676 --> 59:03.401
First is incubation.

59:06.059 --> 59:07.544
The virus spreads
through the host

59:07.578 --> 59:10.616
attacking the central
nervous system

59:10.650 --> 59:13.032
killing the victim.

59:13.066 --> 59:15.759
If the host isn't killed
with the attack

59:15.793 --> 59:17.588
it's killed by the virus.

59:17.623 --> 59:19.659
And then phase two kicks in.

59:21.350 --> 59:23.387
Reanimation of the dead body.

59:30.532 --> 59:32.396
Reanimate?

59:32.430 --> 59:34.191
What do you mean, like a zombie?

59:34.225 --> 59:36.814
You expect me
to believe this bullshit?

59:36.849 --> 59:39.058
You can believe what you want.

59:39.092 --> 59:40.749
But you seen it for yourself.

59:42.855 --> 59:46.375
It lies dormant in the daytime

59:46.410 --> 59:50.207
but at night, the virus wakes
and the body changes.

59:50.241 --> 59:52.347
It becomes what you saw.

59:54.314 --> 59:56.627
[indistinct]

59:56.662 --> 59:59.734
I told you
you wouldn't believe me.

59:59.768 --> 01:00:01.977
And what about my friend?

01:00:02.012 --> 01:00:05.602
She doesn't have much longer,
she is going to die

01:00:05.636 --> 01:00:07.811
and become a Feral.

01:00:09.226 --> 01:00:10.572
Oh, my God.

01:00:13.679 --> 01:00:16.249
And you should know this too.

01:00:16.918 --> 01:00:18.506
It will be back.

01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:22.170
They all will.

01:00:23.516 --> 01:00:25.587
Why will they be back?

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:27.554
Because the food is here.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.696
Food?

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:37.633
[sniffles]

01:00:41.672 --> 01:00:42.915
He means us.

01:00:49.922 --> 01:00:50.922
[sniffles]

01:00:52.062 --> 01:00:54.651
[intense music]

01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:14.463
Eight years ago, we came up here

01:01:14.498 --> 01:01:18.122
on our annual family vacation.

01:01:18.157 --> 01:01:20.090
Love comin' up here.

01:01:20.124 --> 01:01:22.506
My wife, myself

01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:24.473
my son, his wife, my..

01:01:27.718 --> 01:01:28.961
My granddaughter.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.105
Ben went out

01:01:35.139 --> 01:01:37.038
to the woods to get firewood
or something.

01:01:37.072 --> 01:01:39.178
He was attacked..

01:01:40.455 --> 01:01:41.421
...by something.

01:01:41.456 --> 01:01:43.492
I don't even know what.
I didn't see it.

01:01:43.527 --> 01:01:45.632
He bled out
before I could move him.

01:01:47.669 --> 01:01:49.084
He was gone.

01:01:53.123 --> 01:01:56.540
That night, he killed his wife

01:01:56.574 --> 01:01:57.817
and his daughter.

01:01:59.646 --> 01:02:01.269
Tore his mother to pieces.

01:02:03.202 --> 01:02:05.135
And then, they changed.

01:02:11.313 --> 01:02:12.418
[snarls]

01:02:17.078 --> 01:02:18.078
[gunshot]

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:28.572
They're gonna die
and they're going to turn.

01:02:28.606 --> 01:02:31.126
You have to kill them.

01:02:31.161 --> 01:02:32.403
I don't wanna die.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.891
No one is gonna kill anyone.

01:02:39.928 --> 01:02:42.931
- Let's go.
- What are you gonna do?

01:02:42.966 --> 01:02:46.452
I'm gonna put you somewhere
where you can't cause trouble

01:02:46.486 --> 01:02:49.351
until I can figure this out.

01:02:49.386 --> 01:02:51.595
You can't leave me down here!

01:02:51.629 --> 01:02:53.804
They're gonna return,
and you're gonna die

01:02:53.839 --> 01:02:56.082
and I'm gonna be trapped
down here.

01:02:57.359 --> 01:02:59.292
[crickets chirping]

01:03:05.954 --> 01:03:07.611
Okay, so we have to assume
that there are

01:03:07.645 --> 01:03:09.647
three of those things out there.

01:03:09.682 --> 01:03:10.787
Three?

01:03:12.167 --> 01:03:15.515
Jesse, Matt

01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:17.034
Talbot's son.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.727
You think Matt's one, too?

01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:24.801
Yeah. His body disappeared.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.597
Jesus.

01:03:32.878 --> 01:03:34.811
I feel like we should be
doing something.

01:03:36.122 --> 01:03:37.744
Can you go check on Brie?

01:03:38.953 --> 01:03:41.127
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

01:03:45.891 --> 01:03:48.825
[footsteps approaching]

01:03:52.138 --> 01:03:55.072
[mellow music]

01:03:57.005 --> 01:03:58.006
Um..

01:03:59.387 --> 01:04:02.321
Guys, you should come see this.

01:04:02.355 --> 01:04:03.805
Like, now!

01:04:07.119 --> 01:04:08.396
Hold this.

01:04:13.194 --> 01:04:15.472
Is -- is she turning into
one of those things?

01:04:20.753 --> 01:04:21.858
Shit.

01:04:22.686 --> 01:04:24.101
What do we do?

01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:27.691
I don't know, I..

01:04:31.005 --> 01:04:34.042
We should tie her
to the bed? I..

01:04:34.077 --> 01:04:35.482
Do you think that
will even hold her?

01:04:35.492 --> 01:04:37.770
That thing was really
fucking strong.

01:04:39.116 --> 01:04:40.324
Maybe..

01:04:42.326 --> 01:04:44.052
Maybe we should just..

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:46.158
What?

01:04:48.677 --> 01:04:50.610
Put her out of her misery.

01:04:50.645 --> 01:04:52.405
- You mean kill her?
- Yes.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.961
- That's murder, Jules.
- Okay, she's not human anymore!

01:04:55.995 --> 01:04:57.790
- You can see it.
- She's our friend!

01:04:57.824 --> 01:05:00.413
Our friend is about to
rip us apart!

01:05:00.448 --> 01:05:03.554
Okay, I'm a doctor.
I don't take lives, I save them.

01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:05.108
I'm talking about saving
our lives.

01:05:05.142 --> 01:05:07.593
We're not taking any lives,
and that is final!

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:10.009
Do you have a better plan?

01:05:10.044 --> 01:05:12.149
Whatever we do,
we need to do it quick.

01:05:12.874 --> 01:05:14.462
Shit.

01:05:14.496 --> 01:05:17.154
Um, grab -- grab her feet.
Grab her feet.

01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:24.782
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:05:24.817 --> 01:05:25.922
Okay.

01:05:26.853 --> 01:05:28.786
[breathing heavily]

01:05:29.477 --> 01:05:30.927
We need your help.

01:05:31.962 --> 01:05:33.308
Now you want my help?

01:05:33.343 --> 01:05:36.449
I'm not here to fix
your problems.

01:05:36.484 --> 01:05:39.245
She's about to become
your problem, too.

[Brienne whimpering]

01:05:54.053 --> 01:05:57.505

01:05:57.539 --> 01:05:59.300
[whimpering]

01:06:00.157 --> 01:06:01.602
We need to get her
into the cellar.

01:06:01.612 --> 01:06:03.131
You need to shoot her
in the head.

01:06:03.166 --> 01:06:04.443
She is going to turn!

01:06:04.454 --> 01:06:06.297
You are going to help us
get her into the cellar, now!

01:06:06.307 --> 01:06:08.585
- You don't understand!
- Please!

01:06:17.042 --> 01:06:18.284
Hold her still!

01:06:19.354 --> 01:06:21.460
Hold still!
Get her arm!

[shrieking]

01:06:24.946 --> 01:06:26.016
Ah!

01:06:27.052 --> 01:06:28.467
Little help here!

01:06:29.882 --> 01:06:30.882

01:06:46.071 --> 01:06:47.244
Got it!

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.978
Hey, you're going to be okay.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:59.394
Okay?
You're gonna be okay.

01:06:59.429 --> 01:07:01.327
Go get me the medical supplies
from upstairs.

01:07:02.432 --> 01:07:04.399
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

01:07:04.434 --> 01:07:06.263
- Can you sedate her?
- Why?

01:07:06.298 --> 01:07:09.508
- Before she injures herself.
- What's the point?

01:07:09.542 --> 01:07:11.303
There's nothin' you can do
for her now.

01:07:11.337 --> 01:07:13.960
This isn't a debate.
Just do it.

01:07:15.686 --> 01:07:18.344
[Brienne screaming]

01:07:18.379 --> 01:07:20.829
You do realize
you're makin' a mistake?

01:07:20.864 --> 01:07:23.039
Yeah, we'll see.

01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:25.006
[screaming continues]

01:07:37.398 --> 01:07:39.572
I don't know how long
that's gonna hold her for.

01:07:40.884 --> 01:07:43.473
If she wakes up again,
we'll just dose her.

01:07:46.717 --> 01:07:47.822
Hey.

01:07:50.997 --> 01:07:53.345
You're gonna be okay.

01:07:53.379 --> 01:07:55.312
I don't feel very good.

01:08:11.639 --> 01:08:14.849
Best thing you can do for her..

01:08:14.883 --> 01:08:16.678
...is a bullet.

01:08:16.712 --> 01:08:19.371
- Put her out of her misery.
- Will you give it a rest?

01:08:20.957 --> 01:08:24.134
You don't understand
what's at stake here, do you?

01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:27.862
This goes way beyond
self-preservation.

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:30.175
Once we're all Ferals,
how long do you think

01:08:30.209 --> 01:08:32.970
it's gonna be before one of us
makes it to the outside world?

01:08:33.005 --> 01:08:35.249
Well, we'll have to make sure
that doesn't happen.

01:08:38.631 --> 01:08:41.462

- Yeah?

01:09:15.185 --> 01:09:17.497
You're a really good person.

01:09:18.774 --> 01:09:21.191
- I mean that.
- Hey.

01:09:23.124 --> 01:09:25.057
You hold my hand, okay?

01:09:28.371 --> 01:09:29.406
[sniffles]

01:09:38.243 --> 01:09:40.693
What do we do about him?

01:09:44.904 --> 01:09:46.734
Okay, that should,
that should do it.

01:09:46.768 --> 01:09:48.977
Will it hold?

01:09:49.011 --> 01:09:50.255
I guess.

01:09:52.118 --> 01:09:54.569
I thought you were a Girl Scout.

01:09:54.604 --> 01:09:57.262
- Tie a knot.
- I'm, I'm from Brooklyn.

01:09:57.296 --> 01:09:59.402
We don't have Girl Scouts.

They're here.

01:10:09.032 --> 01:10:11.724
Fuck! Could this get
any worse?

01:10:11.759 --> 01:10:14.762
You haven't seen worse yet..

01:10:14.796 --> 01:10:16.384
...but it's comin'.

01:10:45.586 --> 01:10:47.208
Where's your knife?

01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:51.557
Is that your thing..

01:10:52.524 --> 01:10:54.457
...stabbin' people in the back?

01:10:55.147 --> 01:10:56.390
Shut up.

01:11:00.463 --> 01:11:02.465
- Hey!
- What?

01:11:02.499 --> 01:11:04.674
You better do something
about your friend.

01:11:09.299 --> 01:11:10.749
Oh, shit.

01:11:10.783 --> 01:11:12.475
Gina?

01:11:12.509 --> 01:11:14.787
- Is she changing?
- Come untie me.

01:11:14.822 --> 01:11:16.513
- And I -- I'll help.
- No.

01:11:16.548 --> 01:11:19.309
I can't help
if I'm tied to a post.

01:11:19.344 --> 01:11:21.242
I can't do that.
Okay?

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:24.866
Just, just tell me
what to do, all right?

01:11:27.524 --> 01:11:29.802
Maybe you could sedate her.

01:11:29.837 --> 01:11:32.149
Go over to the table
where the bottles are.

01:11:32.184 --> 01:11:33.496
Umm..

01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:35.532
What do I need?

01:11:35.567 --> 01:11:36.602
Thiopental.

01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:40.019
- What's that say?
- Thiopental.

01:11:40.054 --> 01:11:41.883
Okay, that's it.
Use that one.

01:11:41.918 --> 01:11:44.714
Now, find a needle,
one with the top on.

01:11:44.748 --> 01:11:45.784
Not that one.

01:11:45.818 --> 01:11:46.818
Okay.

01:11:48.649 --> 01:11:50.478
Turn the bottle upside down.

01:11:51.893 --> 01:11:54.310
Stick the needle in the center
of the rubber stopper.

01:11:56.346 --> 01:11:58.762
- Okay.
- Pull back on the plunger.

01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:01.351
Okay.

01:12:01.386 --> 01:12:03.664
All right. I got it.

01:12:05.459 --> 01:12:06.667

Yeah, well, this is probably
the safest place we could be.

01:20:19.676 --> 01:20:21.609

to run up those stairs
