NARRATOR:
Two weeks ago,

00:03.962 --> 00:06.339
an invisible dome crashed down
on Chester’s Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.413
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.920
Why the dome is here
or What mysteries lie ahead,

00:11.136 --> 00:14.503
we still don 't know.
Every day, it tests our limits,

00:14.723 --> 00:17.305
bringing out the best
and the worst in us.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.180
Some say
we 7/ be stuck here forever.

00:21.980 --> 00:25.723
But we will never stop ﬁghting
to ﬁnd a way out.

00:26.527 --> 00:30.019
Rebecca Pine thinks Chester's Mill
can't sustain itself for much longer.

00:30.239 --> 00:33.857
She and Jim wanna use the census
to decide who lives and who doesn't.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.907
SAM: That pig virus
is their extermination plan.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.734
Yeah, she doesn't know
how strong it is.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.661
Get away from me. Unh!

00:39.873 --> 00:41.079
You tried to kill us all.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.033
- What are you doing here?
- She's joining you in jail.

00:44.253 --> 00:45.493
What are you gonna do to us?

00:45.712 --> 00:48.328
Tomorrow we'll have a town meeting.
The people can decide your fate.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.540
You've come to set me free.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.715
My mother said you had answers.
I want them.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.008
This is it, right?

Those are the fingertips of a hand.
Looks like Angie got a piece

00:59.017 --> 01:00.518
of whoever did this to her.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.686
JIM:
What do you say, Phil?

01:05.732 --> 01:07.188
Can I count on you?

01:07.901 --> 01:10.643
I am Melanie Cross.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.148
And I think this is where I died.

01:19.538 --> 01:20.698
YOUNG PAULINE:
Oh, my God.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.155
- We have to help her.
YOUNG SAM: I don't think we can.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.832
- It's too late.
YOUNG PAULINE: She's dying!

01:34.845 --> 01:36.255
What are you doing?

01:36.471 --> 01:37.847
You were moaning.

01:38.056 --> 01:42.015
- Nightmare?
- No, just a dream.

01:42.394 --> 01:45.261
Not as scary as waking up to you two
standing over me.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.857
None of us sleep very well
these days.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.808
I need to find Sam Verdreaux.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.777
Find out what really happened
the night I died.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.650
JOE:
I know you want some answers,

01:55.866 --> 01:59.279
but we promised Barbie we wouldn't
do anything until after he talks to Julia.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.998
- Melanie stayed with Joe and Norrie.
- Melanie?

02:07.210 --> 02:08.245
How do you know her name?

02:09.338 --> 02:10.669
It's a long story.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.667
You wouldn't happen to know
where Sam is?

02:12.883 --> 02:14.419
He just left.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.419
We were up all night working.
Why are you looking for Sam?

02:18.639 --> 02:21.472
Because I think he's known
who Melanie is all along.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.469
JULIA:
All right, tell me everything.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.722
The kids found her picture
in the school yearbook.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.394
So she's a student here?

02:28.607 --> 02:31.098
Was. In 1988.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.058
I know.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.485
I'm still processing all of this.

02:35.697 --> 02:40.566
She also knows exactly where
Joe and Norrie found the mini-dome.

02:40.786 --> 02:42.447
- How?
-Twenty-five years ago,

02:42.663 --> 02:46.576
she and three of her friends found
a meteorite in exactly the same spot

02:46.792 --> 02:48.908
in the woods. With an egg inside.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.164
Melanie said that when she found it,
that she wanted to protect it.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.746
And the others got violent.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.377
And then one of her friends killed her.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.258
She's not sure who.

02:58.470 --> 02:59.835
Who were the three friends?

Pauline Verdreaux,

03:02.766 --> 03:04.472

03:04.685 --> 03:05.720

03:07.479 --> 03:10.346
This is just par for the course
for Chester's Mill.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.353
And we need to talk about
what happened the other day.

03:13.568 --> 03:16.856
About you supporting
Jim and Rebecca's extermination plot?

03:17.072 --> 03:20.064
- How could you think I'd actually--?
- Because I was there.

03:20.283 --> 03:23.775
I was listening so I could make sure
I knew exactly what they were up to.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.121
So I could stop them.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.408
I made Jim look me in the eye

03:27.624 --> 03:29.706
and promise me
that he wasn't going to do anything.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.794
I don't know that I believe that.

03:32.003 --> 03:35.996

I'm the bad guy, then fine.

Trying to find
what you've been hiding from me.

04:18.467 --> 04:19.832
Like my mom's journal.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.461
I don't have it, Junior.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.919
- Someone stole it.
- That was Lyle.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.675
Lyle's in jail.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.552
He was until I snuck him out.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.760
He told me my mom's journal
had predictions in it.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.389
Like who was gonna kill Angie.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.895
- What did you find out?
- I didn't get that far.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.600
He attacked me and he ran off with it.
Didn't want me to see what was in it.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.977
So he must've killed Angie, right?

04:42.908 --> 04:44.990
He always has been a little nuts.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.279
A page is missing from the journal.

04:50.499 --> 04:54.367
I thought if I'd find it I'd figure out
where he's going or what he'll do next.

04:54.586 --> 04:55.951
Or where he's run off to.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.377
You won't find anything.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.204
If Lyle hurts somebody else,
it's on me.

04:59.424 --> 05:00.880
So we'll stop him. Together.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.552
I should have never trusted him,
no matter what my mom said.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.971
Your mother told you to trust Lyle?

for the town meeting, Julia.

who tried to murder us with a virus?

05:54.729 --> 05:56.105
Jim wasn't caught with no virus.

05:56.314 --> 05:59.272
It was a setup, all right? So she can
take over and put him on trial.

- Not yet.

the town for him, but no sign of him.

has to change. It's called science.

He wasn't.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.977
We went behind his back.

there was another way.

Yes, you do.

Well, Big Jim made me sheriff,
and when people are at risk, I act.

12:35.421 --> 12:38.128
You could have just arrested Wendell.
Barbie had already disarmed him.

Instead you killed him.

the fact that Lyle escaped

You'll get over it. We have.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.448
When you touch the dome

14:33.664 --> 14:35.746
it's gonna give you a little shock.

So if you get scared, just let go.

Nothing.

Absolutely nothing.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.072
You sure about this?

15:14.705 --> 15:17.117
I already searched this place
pretty good.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.119
I've known Lyle a long time.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.082
Guy's got a lot of tricks up his sleeve.

- You found them.

15:39.397 --> 15:42.184
See? Your mom did draw Angie.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.766
Lyle stole these to keep me
from knowing what he did.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.694
But-- But why kill Angie?
He hardly knew her.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.862
Maybe this has something to do
with it?

15:51.075 --> 15:52.940
The four hands.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.114
Pauline ranted about a lot of things.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.740
Pink stars,
a dome that would trap us,

15:57.957 --> 16:00.118
and the four hands
that would be its protectors.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.246
She used to say,
"Four hands will hold up the dome,

16:03.463 --> 16:05.044
and without them it will fall."

16:06.215 --> 16:08.752
If one of the hands wasn't around,
the dome would come down?

16:11.262 --> 16:13.253
That's why Lyle did it.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.338
He killed Angie
to bring down the dome.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.015
So Angie was one
of the four hands?

16:19.270 --> 16:21.761
Maybe all four hands
have to die for it to work.

16:24.775 --> 16:27.027
I have to go. Have to make sure
the other hands are okay.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.567

Yeah.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.405
Joe, Norrie and me.

16:34.285 --> 16:37.448
If Lyle thinks that killing the four
hands will bring down the dome,

It's a sad fact of my life
that I have. Yeah.

17:04.106 --> 17:09.271
So how do you deal with it?

17:10.321 --> 17:14.109
Just by knowing it's all part
of a larger design.

17:15.535 --> 17:19.153
Wendell's death means
we get to live.

17:20.081 --> 17:21.867
I'd say that's a pretty good trade-off.

17:23.084 --> 17:27.202
That-- That's what I told myself
about our population plan.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.788

Sometimes it's necessary.

Run tests, you get results,
and then take action.

about to release the virus,

17:53.864 --> 17:55.820

17:56.701 --> 17:58.612

families to suffer the way she did, I--
