Many claim a supplement has freed them
from a life of prescription pain pills,

00:21.897 --> 00:24.566
while others say it is a dangerous
unregulated substance.

00:24.608 --> 00:26.193
It's called kratom.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.153
What we're hoping to have today
is a meaningful discussion,

00:28.195 --> 00:30.906
and we have, joining us, a
panel of kratom proponents,

00:30.948 --> 00:33.826
documentary filmmaker, Chris Bell...

00:33.868 --> 00:36.077
[Chris Bell] <i> Why does
this always happen to me?</i>

00:36.119 --> 00:38.580
<i>It seems like I always end up in the middle.</i>

00:38.622 --> 00:41.082
<i>In my first film,</i> Bigger Stronger Faster,

00:41.124 --> 00:45.044
<i>my brothers were both using steroids,
and I wasn't.</i>

00:45.086 --> 00:48.883
<i>I was stuck in the middle of following
the rules, or being the best.</i>

00:48.924 --> 00:50.885
<i>In my second film,</i> Trophy Kids,

00:50.926 --> 00:52.845
<i>I ended up in the middle of anxious parents</i>

00:52.887 --> 00:55.597
<i>living vicariously through their children's
sports dreams.</i>

00:55.639 --> 00:57.516
[man] Pull your head out of your ass, dude,
seriously.

00:57.558 --> 01:01.603
Can you be any stupider? How dumb!

01:01.645 --> 01:04.397
[Chris] <i> In Prescription Thugs,</i>
I exposed Big Pharma...

01:04.438 --> 01:07.234
- [Chris] How many pills a day were you doing?
- Ninety.

01:07.275 --> 01:10.529
[Chris] <i> ...as well as my own addiction</i>
<i>to opioid painkillers.</i>

01:10.571 --> 01:14.408
<i>See, the thing is, before I was a filmmaker,
I was a powerlifter</i>

01:14.449 --> 01:16.410
<i>and I wasn't half bad.</i>

01:16.451 --> 01:18.286
<i>Lifting gave me purpose.</i>

01:18.328 --> 01:19.830
<i>I was a shy, chubby kid.</i>

01:19.872 --> 01:21.415
<i>But when I started breaking records,</i>

01:21.456 --> 01:23.834
<i>and lifting more than my older brother
Mad Dog,</i>

01:23.876 --> 01:26.962
<i>people began to notice, and it felt good.</i>

01:27.004 --> 01:29.548
<i>I even got my little brother Smelly involved.</i>

01:29.590 --> 01:32.300
<i>At one point, we had so many trophies
from lifting,</i>

01:32.342 --> 01:34.595
<i>that we'd just throw them in the garbage.</i>

01:34.636 --> 01:37.180
<i>I no longer wanted to be like my heroes.</i>

01:37.222 --> 01:40.392
<i>I just wanted to be the
strongest man in the world.</i>

01:40.434 --> 01:44.521
<i>But what I didn't realize is, all
that wear and tear on the human body</i>

01:44.563 --> 01:46.440
<i>comes with a price.</i>

01:46.481 --> 01:48.275
<i>And, for me, that price was...</i>

01:48.316 --> 01:49.651
Pain.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.946
[Chris] <i> Shortly after</i> Bigger Stronger Faster,

01:51.987 --> 01:54.364
<i>I had both of my hips completely replaced</i>

01:54.406 --> 01:56.199
<i>due to a genetic condition.</i>

01:56.241 --> 02:01.038
<i>My dad had hip surgery at 17.
So, it runs in the family.</i>

02:01.080 --> 02:05.208
<i>This is a double hip replacement surgery.
And I'm only 35 years old.</i>

02:05.250 --> 02:09.088
<i>Sounds scary, right? Well, not for me.</i>

02:09.128 --> 02:11.423
<i>They told me I was going to
be walking the same day.</i>

02:11.465 --> 02:14.551
<i>This is what they mean
by walking the same day.</i>

02:14.593 --> 02:17.930
<i>I'm high on painkillers. So,
all I can picture is myself</i>

02:17.972 --> 02:21.850
<i>all jacked and tan, in a</i> Rocky <i> montage,
making a comeback.</i>

02:24.061 --> 02:27.856
<i>The more it hurt, the more pills I took.</i>

02:27.898 --> 02:31.610
<i>But when I was about to turn that corner
and run up the stairs,</i>

02:31.652 --> 02:37.532
<i>my brother Mad Dog died in a sober
living facility, at 37 years old.</i>

02:37.574 --> 02:41.954
<i>After seeing my brother die, and knowing
that drugs were at the core of it,</i>

02:41.996 --> 02:44.498
<i>you would think I would stop taking pills.</i>

02:44.539 --> 02:48.585
<i>But at that point, it was too late.
I was addicted.</i>

02:48.627 --> 02:52.380
<i>My life was going off the rails,
but I wasn't the only one.</i>

02:52.422 --> 02:56.259
<i>It seemed like our whole country
was popping pills.</i>

02:56.301 --> 03:01.598
<i>American account for the use of
approximately 99% of one specific opioid,</i>

03:01.640 --> 03:03.976
<i>a powerful painkiller called hydrocodone.</i>

03:04.018 --> 03:08.522
Every day, 91 Americans die
from an overdose of opioids,

03:08.563 --> 03:11.108
<i>which include prescription
painkillers and heroin.</i>

03:11.150 --> 03:14.528
We know that four out of five new heroin users

03:14.569 --> 03:16.113
started on prescription pills.

03:16.155 --> 03:20.826
We saw more people die of drug overdoses

03:20.868 --> 03:23.078
than die of car accidents.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.872
[news anchor] <i> In and around
Huntington, West Virginia,</i>

03:24.913 --> 03:28.709
28 overdoses occurred in one five-hour span.

03:28.750 --> 03:33.338
[Chris] <i> The point that everyone is missing
is that we don't have an opioid epidemic,</i>

03:33.380 --> 03:37.134
<i>we have a pain epidemic, and we're
just treating the wrong thing.</i>

03:37.176 --> 03:42.389
You've been doing a documentary about
all the different components

03:42.430 --> 03:44.808
of addiction, of selling these pills,

03:44.850 --> 03:46.977
and yet, you still got sucked into their web.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.979
Yeah, exactly, that's how powerful it is.

03:49.021 --> 03:53.108
But you are about as educated
about it as a person can be.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.110
I think now I am.

03:55.152 --> 03:57.946
[Chris] <i> During the making of</i> Prescription
Thugs, <i>the film was delayed,</i>

03:57.988 --> 03:59.698
<i>and the funding got pulled,</i>

03:59.740 --> 04:01.700
<i>and I didn't know how to handle it.</i>

04:01.742 --> 04:05.620
<i>I relapsed and ended up back on pills.</i>

04:05.662 --> 04:09.249
<i>They say you haven't made it in Hollywood
until you've been to rehab.</i>

04:09.290 --> 04:13.003
<i>So, I went out to Malibu
to face my demons head on.</i>

04:13.045 --> 04:17.048
<i>But after 90 days of rehab, and doing
everything that was asked of me,</i>

04:17.091 --> 04:20.802
<i>there was one big glaring problem
that rehab couldn't fix:</i>

04:22.221 --> 04:24.181
<i>I was still in pain.</i>

04:36.777 --> 04:40.114
<i>I had kicked my addiction and was
back on the straight and narrow.</i>

04:40.155 --> 04:43.450
<i>I began searching for alternatives
to relieve my pain.</i>

04:46.494 --> 04:48.956
So, after I got done with the opioids,

04:48.997 --> 04:50.791
I was on Dr. Drew's show,

04:50.832 --> 04:53.334
and he said, "Well, you should try Advil
and Tylenol in combination."

04:53.376 --> 04:55.629
"That's going to be better than an opioid
for your chronic pain."

04:55.670 --> 04:57.589
So, I said, "Okay." I start trying that.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.592
Then I get a phone call from my friend
who lives in England,

05:00.634 --> 05:02.343
who tells me he just had a kidney transplant

05:02.385 --> 05:04.304
because of all the NSAIDs he was taking.

05:04.345 --> 05:07.307
[Chris] <i>NSAIDs are non-steroidal</i>
<i>anti-inflammatories.</i>

05:07.348 --> 05:12.146
<i>Things like the painkillers found
in Advil, Aleve, and aspirin.</i>

05:12.187 --> 05:14.940
<i>So, what's the answer? Am I supposed to just
live with the pain?</i>

05:17.025 --> 05:19.486
<i>Then I get a call from a familiar voice.</i>

05:19.527 --> 05:22.781
It's good to see you. I missed you, man.
I haven't seen you in so long.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.950
- We haven't even talked in a while.
- What's up?

05:24.992 --> 05:27.828
[Chris] <i> My friend Horshu said he'd discovered</i>
<i>the holy grail,</i>

05:27.869 --> 05:31.706
<i>a natural painkiller that won't kill you,
called kratom.</i>

05:31.748 --> 05:35.543
- [Chris] When did you start taking it?
- About nine months ago. Yeah.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.671
- And how do you feel?
- I feel great.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.589
Yeah, so we talked in <i> Prescription Thugs,</i>

05:39.631 --> 05:43.093
you had "a massive, massive, massive stroke,"
in the words of your doctor.

05:43.135 --> 05:45.846
- Does it help with that?
- It helped me immensely.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.307
- How do you handle pain?
- I take kratom.

05:48.347 --> 05:51.392
- How did you handle it before?
- Look, man, I would stand up,

05:51.434 --> 05:53.728
I'd stand up, I'd walk like this.
You remember.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.480
I'd be walking like this.

05:55.522 --> 05:58.525
You know what I mean? Hunched
over for 20 minutes,

05:58.566 --> 06:01.111
- you know what I mean? Walking slow.
- Yes, slowly...

06:01.153 --> 06:04.823
Now I just stand up... Stand up, walk around.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.616
You know, when that study came out,

06:06.658 --> 06:08.618
<i>- I was like, "65 wrestlers under the age of 50..."</i>
- [Wiese] <i> Yeah.</i>

06:08.660 --> 06:13.081
- ..."have died. And they blame steroids all the time, right?"
- Yeah. [scoffs]

06:13.123 --> 06:18.086
It's not steroids. It's the wrong combination
of drugs.

06:18.128 --> 06:23.258
It's probably alcohol with Vicodin,
with cocaine, you know what I mean?

06:23.300 --> 06:26.594
[Kurt Angle] <i> I knew as long as I
stuffed myself with painkillers,</i>

06:26.636 --> 06:29.388
I couldn't feel it, and I
couldn't feel the pain.

06:29.430 --> 06:32.351
And I would go as long as I could
until my body couldn't go anymore.

06:32.391 --> 06:36.230
Yeah, Vicodin and vodka
were my closest friends.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.856
- [Reporter] Wow.
- And my closest enemies.

06:37.898 --> 06:41.400
Once I had the stroke, I refused to go back
to pain pills.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.861
You know, before I had the stroke,

06:42.903 --> 06:46.073
I was doing about 90 pain
pills a day for seven years.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.742
And then when I had the
stroke, when I recovered,

06:48.783 --> 06:52.329
I refused to go back to pain pills.
And I found kratom.

06:54.289 --> 06:57.667
[Chris] <i> Horshu pointed us to Vegas to meet</i>
<i>his friend Kelly,</i>

06:57.709 --> 07:00.461
<i>who's been selling kratom since 2010.</i>

07:00.503 --> 07:03.631
<i>He owns one of the top kratom companies</i>
<i>in the country.</i> I used to be into boats

07:03.673 --> 07:06.801
and boatracing, and so forth,
and I was in an accident

07:06.843 --> 07:08.387
where, you know, I broke my orbital,

07:08.427 --> 07:10.513
and broke the right side of
my face in a boat crash.

07:10.555 --> 07:14.059
When I went to the doctor, especially for
the orbital, there is nothing they can do.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.144
So, they give me pain medication.
They give me Percocets.

07:16.186 --> 07:20.523
And he gave me, I want to say 60 pills,
with three refills.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.319
- Worst off, I'd need it for...
- Yeah, a week.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.404
Yeah, a week maybe.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.447
Maybe four or five days, maybe.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.157
Like everybody else, I
started taking the Percs,

07:29.199 --> 07:30.867
and they kinda become a habit for me.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.036
Then you start thinking about, "Well, shit,"

07:33.078 --> 07:35.289
"my day might not function quite as well"

07:35.330 --> 07:37.291
"if I don't take this, I better take it."

07:37.332 --> 07:41.420
It led to the point where now when I
wanted to stop, I was going to get sick.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.923
Somebody had introduced me to kratom. I
was involved in the head shop industry.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.758
<i>I owned a couple of smoke shops at the time.</i>

07:46.800 --> 07:48.802
And introduced to kratom,

07:48.843 --> 07:51.679
and it was a real easy transition
out of the Percocets.

07:51.721 --> 07:55.350
What's so special about this stuff?
Why should we care about kratom?

07:55.392 --> 07:58.895
[Dunn] <i> You know, for one, because it's
been so helpful to so many people.</i>

07:58.937 --> 08:01.606
<i>We know that it's been a medicinal plant
for hundreds of years.</i>

08:01.648 --> 08:04.859
<i>There were tribes in Indonesia that used
to build their village</i>

08:04.901 --> 08:06.153
<i>around a series of kratom trees,</i>

08:06.194 --> 08:08.947
<i>because it was central to their way of life.</i>

08:08.989 --> 08:11.908
[Chris] <i> So, if people have been using this</i>
<i>for hundreds of years,</i>

08:11.950 --> 08:13.743
<i>Why have I never heard of it?</i>

08:13.785 --> 08:17.122
<i>Dr. Darshan Singh has been studying
the traditional uses of kratom</i>

08:17.164 --> 08:20.292
<i>in his homeland of Malaysia
for over ten years.</i>

08:20.334 --> 08:24.629
I've been spending a lot of time
on kratom research in Malaysia,

08:24.671 --> 08:27.799
and in Malaysia I'm known as Dr. kratom,
okay?

08:27.841 --> 08:31.678
So, I'd been going in, trying to understand
why people use kratom.

08:31.719 --> 08:34.306
<i>If I were to make my own kratom tea
for personal consumption,</i>

08:34.347 --> 08:38.309
<i>I would just have to go behind my house and
just pluck maybe like about 20 leaves,</i>

08:38.352 --> 08:42.272
just brew it, and I would just switch off
the fire,

08:42.313 --> 08:47.277
and then allow it to cool down, and
then just consume it the whole day.

08:47.319 --> 08:50.238
So, you guys don't have an
opioid crisis like we have...

08:50.280 --> 08:52.366
Oh, we have opioid addiction problem.

08:52.407 --> 08:56.286
People are using kratom to
self-treat opioid abuse,

08:56.328 --> 08:58.746
alcohol abuse, and crystal meth abuse.

08:58.788 --> 09:01.875
You can actually use kratom
to treat chronic pain.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.336
<i>And you can also use it to
treat opioid addiction,</i>

09:04.378 --> 09:07.047
<i>because opioid addiction is
also associated with pain.</i>

09:07.088 --> 09:09.841
In traditional settings,
those who are using kratom,

09:09.883 --> 09:15.305
they are not labeled or stereotyped
as drug addicts or drug users.

09:15.347 --> 09:17.682
They do not engage in criminal behavior.

09:17.724 --> 09:21.561
<i>If you were to compare heroin or
morphine users on the street,</i>

09:21.602 --> 09:23.730
<i>they do engage in risky behaviors,</i>

09:23.771 --> 09:27.234
they do commit crime, because they have
to support their addictive behaviors.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.110
While kratom users, in traditional settings,

09:29.152 --> 09:30.737
they use kratom for medicinal purpose.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.614
And people living in Southeast Asia,

09:33.656 --> 09:35.242
like from where I'm coming, Malaysia,

09:35.283 --> 09:38.870
people have been using kratom
for over 200 years, okay?

09:38.912 --> 09:41.998
And you need to make sure that you have

09:42.040 --> 09:47.045
genuine distributors of
kratom in the United States.

09:47.087 --> 09:51.508
[Chris] <i> If kratom is so great, then why
haven't I seen it on store shelves?</i>

09:51.550 --> 09:55.345
<i>Probably 'cause you can't get it
at your local pharmacy or GNC.</i>

09:55.387 --> 09:58.515
<i>For now, you have to venture
into your local smoke shop.</i>

09:58.557 --> 10:01.059
<i>And that's not usually
where I get my medicine.</i>

10:01.101 --> 10:06.106
So, this is more what I would picture,
like, a supplement to look like.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.107
Yeah.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.526
[speaks indistinctly]

10:09.568 --> 10:10.527
Yeah.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.489
Happy kratom.

10:14.531 --> 10:18.659
I was in the army for six years, and I have
friends with PTSD, who...

10:18.701 --> 10:20.370
They give them this drug and that drug,

10:20.412 --> 10:23.206
and they all have bad side effects,
and they get hooked on them.

10:23.248 --> 10:25.459
But they can use this, not get hooked on it,

10:25.500 --> 10:27.586
and not have all the bad effects.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.754
I'm not going to say it's
going to cure it 100%.

10:29.796 --> 10:33.633
But it helps them live day-to-day
without having an outburst,

10:33.674 --> 10:36.219
or having a flashback.

10:36.261 --> 10:39.514
- It just lets them have a normal life.
- [Chris] Yeah.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.976
[Rezvani] I work seven days a week,
and my feet, trust me, they kill me.

10:43.017 --> 10:46.313
- [chuckles]
- And then I take it, and after, like, half an hour,

10:46.354 --> 10:50.775
it's a different feeling. I
don't feel that pain anymore.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.736
And it makes it easier for
me to go on with my day.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.738
[Chris] <i> Okay, so people take kratom</i>

10:55.780 --> 10:57.698
<i>because they want to self-medicate.</i>

10:57.740 --> 11:02.162
<i>But before I try it, I wanted to
talk to an expert on this stuff.</i>

11:02.203 --> 11:04.038
<i>So, I found Dr. Schoenwetter.</i>

11:04.080 --> 11:07.375
<i>He has a lot of patients come to him
to ween off of opiates.</i>

11:07.417 --> 11:09.794
<i>And often times, he recommends kratom.</i>

11:09.836 --> 11:13.465
<i>He's also been tracking the progress
of over 100 of his patients</i>

11:13.507 --> 11:15.008
<i>that are taking the plant.</i>

11:15.049 --> 11:19.053
There are so many compounds within the plant,

11:19.095 --> 11:21.556
that the plant itself is a virtual pharmacy.

11:21.598 --> 11:25.519
The beauty of this, of course,
is that you don't need me

11:25.560 --> 11:27.228
to write it on a piece of paper.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.063
You can just get it yourself.

11:29.105 --> 11:32.275
So, it's a great backup tool if you
need something with a little more

11:32.317 --> 11:34.068
oomph than leaf.

11:34.110 --> 11:38.072
<i>There's a thing called affinity,
and a thing called activity.</i>

11:38.114 --> 11:41.784
<i>Affinity is how much substance
will stick to a receptor.</i>

11:43.995 --> 11:47.790
<i>So, if you can imagine having superglue
on your finger,</i>

11:47.832 --> 11:51.044
<i>- and touching a piano key...</i>
- [plays note]

11:51.085 --> 11:53.838
<i>...you've got a very high degree of affinity.</i>

11:53.880 --> 11:57.217
<i>But activity...</i> [laughs] <i>Even
though you're stuck to the key,</i>

11:57.258 --> 12:01.304
<i>- you may not be able to press the key very loud.</i>
- [plays note]

12:01.346 --> 12:05.559
<i>Kratom seems to have a high affinity</i>

12:05.600 --> 12:08.936
<i>for some of the opioid receptors,
but it has a ceiling</i>

12:08.978 --> 12:12.190
<i>and so, it has a limited activity.</i>
[chuckles]

12:12.232 --> 12:15.902
<i>It's not dangerous. But heroin,
or a strong opiate,</i>

12:15.943 --> 12:18.029
<i>can push the key to make it really loud.</i>

12:18.071 --> 12:20.990
[loud discordant notes]

12:22.783 --> 12:26.829
<i>Whereas buprenorphine and kratom aren't able
to make it as loud.</i>

12:26.871 --> 12:30.667
<i>They're stuck to the key, but they
can't make it play as loud.</i> [chuckles]

12:31.626 --> 12:33.211
I'm taking it today

12:33.253 --> 12:35.796
because I've had problems with arthritis
and a knee effusion.

12:35.838 --> 12:38.675
So, I'm able now to get off the walker,

12:38.717 --> 12:42.136
and get off the offloader knee brace,
and I'm back to myself.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.223
So, tell me how you came across kratom.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.059
I got introduced to it as the guy

12:48.101 --> 12:49.894
who was putting gas in the car.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.938
<i>My wife had a migraine headache.</i>

12:51.979 --> 12:55.358
<i>She said, "Well, I'll go dig up
something here at the station."</i>

12:55.400 --> 12:57.776
<i>At that time, a lady of the evening
was stepping in.</i>

12:57.818 --> 13:00.321
<i>And reached behind by the cigarettes,</i>

13:00.363 --> 13:03.658
<i>and alcohol, and pulled out a packet
of kratom.</i>

13:03.700 --> 13:06.494
<i>My wife immediately said, "What's that?"</i>

13:06.536 --> 13:09.956
<i>The kind lady said, "It makes a lot
of the aches and pains just go away."</i>

13:09.997 --> 13:11.583
<i>Karen says, "I'll take one."</i>

13:11.625 --> 13:13.834
Got in the car and said, "Phil,
what do you know about this?"

13:13.876 --> 13:18.339
I know nothing. Absolutely nothing.

13:18.381 --> 13:23.511
I drove on. We headed south, and
about 65 miles later, she said,

13:23.553 --> 13:25.597
"Phil, the headache's gone."

13:25.639 --> 13:28.558
I said, "Really?" I said, "Do you feel drowsy,
dopey, sleepy?"

13:28.600 --> 13:29.892
"No, I want to drive down."

13:29.934 --> 13:32.437
Have you seen a lot of
side effects with kratom?

13:33.772 --> 13:36.441
Gastrointestinal is the
predominant side effect.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.444
I took a whole bag myself
just to push the limits,

13:39.486 --> 13:42.280
to see if I was giving anyone a toxic dose.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.365
I got constipated.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.200
- That's about it?
- That's it.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.120
[Chris] <i> Dr. Schoenwetter assured
me that kratom was safe.</i>

13:49.162 --> 13:51.247
<i>But let's check out the science.</i>

13:51.289 --> 13:56.711
Went to pharmacy school to understand
what it is about drugs

13:56.753 --> 14:00.548
that can make us heal, or can hurt us.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.592
[Chris] <i> This is Dr. Chris McCurdy.</i>

14:02.634 --> 14:05.219
<i>He is a professor at the
University of Florida,</i>

14:05.261 --> 14:07.846
<i>and the world-leading expert on kratom.</i>

14:07.888 --> 14:11.351
[McCurdy] <i> We kind of relate the abuse
potential of the plant itself,</i>

14:11.392 --> 14:13.561
kind of similar to that of coffee.

14:13.603 --> 14:16.314
And it's interesting, 'cause
it's in the coffee family.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.941
And so what we've done is
systematically gone through,

14:18.983 --> 14:21.402
as I mentioned, looking at
the individual compounds,

14:21.444 --> 14:24.364
and started taking out certain alkaloids

14:24.405 --> 14:26.991
that we thought might be responsible
for that effect.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.661
And we've got down to a modified extract

14:29.703 --> 14:32.079
that didn't show any side effects on its own.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.956
<i>What's different about kratom</i>

14:33.998 --> 14:37.669
<i>is the fact that it not only interacts
with that new opioid receptor,</i>

14:37.711 --> 14:40.463
<i>it also interacts with dopamine receptors.</i>

14:40.505 --> 14:42.382
<i>So, when you activate dopamine systems,</i>

14:42.423 --> 14:44.091
<i>you feel pleasurable, you feel good.</i>

14:44.133 --> 14:46.886
<i>We ran the most comprehensive target screen
on it</i>

14:46.927 --> 14:50.139
<i>that's ever been published, and we came back
with this profile</i>

14:50.181 --> 14:53.643
<i>that says serotonin, dopamine,
alpha-adrenergic, and opioid.</i>

14:53.685 --> 14:57.313
<i>And I was like, "Holy cow,
this is maybe the one drug</i>

14:57.355 --> 15:01.067
that could really treat opioid addiction

15:01.108 --> 15:04.070
in a single chemical entity.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.656
There may be a cure for the pain.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.324
We think we're well on our way.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.869
<i>We get these mice addicted to morphine</i>

15:10.910 --> 15:14.664
if we give them a antagonist, Naloxone,

15:14.706 --> 15:17.166
they will go into full withdrawal.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.377
<i>What we call "wet dog shakes,"</i>

15:19.419 --> 15:22.714
just like when a dog gets out of a pond
and dries itself off,

15:22.756 --> 15:24.549
- but these animals aren't wet.
- Yeah.

15:24.591 --> 15:29.095
They'll chatter their teeth. You
can literally hear them, the mice.

15:29.136 --> 15:32.265
And then they'll have paw tremors.

15:32.306 --> 15:36.102
<i>Most of the animals don't have very severe
withdrawal after methadone,</i>

15:36.143 --> 15:40.940
but the issue with methadone is
they've continued to lose weight.

15:40.981 --> 15:44.193
And so, it seems that the methadone

15:44.235 --> 15:49.783
is taking over their normal
innate behavior to want to eat

15:49.824 --> 15:54.370
<i>versus the animals that we habituate to
morphine, and then switch over to kratom.</i>

15:54.412 --> 15:56.497
They return to eating normally.

15:56.539 --> 16:00.960
And their body weight comes back to
what it was when we started with them.

16:01.001 --> 16:04.088
Or, a little bit above, which
is where you'd wanna be,

16:04.130 --> 16:06.716
'cause we're using these animals
in their growth phase.

16:06.758 --> 16:08.259
[Chris] <i> As a scientist studying it,</i>

16:08.301 --> 16:10.470
<i>- do you try it yourself?</i>
- [McCurdy] <i> I've never tried it.</i>

16:10.511 --> 16:12.555
<i>We've brewed teas in the lab,</i>

16:12.597 --> 16:15.809
but from the science standpoint, I
don't want to be dated or biased

16:15.850 --> 16:17.685
<i>in my opinion of it.</i>

16:17.727 --> 16:20.020
- [Chris] Have you ever tried it?
- Yeah, I have.

16:20.062 --> 16:23.357
- And what was your effects?
- Mild mood elevation.

16:23.399 --> 16:26.486
And I'm not in pain, so it's hard to comment
on any analgesic effects.

16:26.527 --> 16:27.612
Yeah.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.280
Kratom represents a great starting point

16:29.322 --> 16:31.991
for developing new, safer pain relievers

16:32.032 --> 16:34.911
to replace the opioids that we have now
on the market.

16:34.953 --> 16:41.208
And also, potential implications for treating
mood disorders like depression and anxiety.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.085
But these are a bit ratty-looking.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.296
[chuckles] Does it smell?

16:46.881 --> 16:48.842
- Smells like leaves.
- Yeah, a little bit. Yeah, wow.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.802
- So, that's all it is, huh?
- [Kruegel] Yeah.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.473
And this is the mitragynine.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.643
So, that's what it looks
like, it's just a powder.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.688
So, what you do is you make it, and
then you just run tests on it?

17:01.729 --> 17:05.441
[Kruegel] Yeah, we run tests in cells,
and we run tests on animals, so...

17:05.483 --> 17:07.986
And we try to extrapolate from that to humans,

17:08.027 --> 17:09.945
but of course, there's limits to that.

17:09.988 --> 17:13.616
So, this is what it looks like when it
still has the chlorophyll impurities.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.242
- It's green like the leaf.
- [Chris] Yeah.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.036
Well, what's your goal? What
do you wanna do with it?

17:17.077 --> 17:19.497
My goal is to make all these analogues

17:19.539 --> 17:22.583
and try to come up with a better version
of the compounds

17:22.625 --> 17:24.460
that are out there in the plant itself.

17:24.502 --> 17:27.505
And eventually, bring that to market
as an FDA-approved drug...

17:27.547 --> 17:29.382
- [Chris] <i> Sure.
- ...to replace oxycodone</i>

17:29.423 --> 17:31.300
<i>and the strong painkillers.</i>

17:31.342 --> 17:34.178
I mean, I think there's a place for
both, you know, new pharmaceuticals

17:34.220 --> 17:37.724
that we develop synthetically, starting from
the kratom alkaloids,

17:37.765 --> 17:41.519
and also for kratom itself to be legal.
There's no reason they can't co-exist.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.898
'Cause I really think they're addressing
different issues.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.066
[Chris] <i> This is Kratom 101.</i>

17:47.107 --> 17:50.152
<i>Kratom comes from the
plant</i> Mitragyna speciosa.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.781
<i>It's a plant in the coffee family
that grows in Southeast Asia.</i>

17:53.823 --> 17:57.535
<i>The kratom plant has been chewed, ground up,
or drank as a tea</i>

17:57.577 --> 18:01.247
<i>for over 2,000 years in traditional
and religious rituals,</i>

18:01.288 --> 18:04.042
<i>with zero history of fatal poisonings
or deaths,</i>

18:04.083 --> 18:06.044
<i>and very little known abuse.</i>

18:06.085 --> 18:08.546
<i>Kratom is made up of over 40 alkaloids.</i>

18:08.588 --> 18:12.675
<i>What are alkaloids? Alkaloids are the active
ingredient in the plant.</i>

18:12.717 --> 18:15.386
<i>Caffeine is an alkaloid of coffee or tea.</i>

18:15.428 --> 18:19.223
<i>The active alkaloids in kratom that are
responsible for its health effects</i>

18:19.265 --> 18:23.352
<i>are mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine.</i>

18:23.394 --> 18:27.690
<i>The way the plant is set up, at low doses,
it works like a good cup of coffee.</i>

18:27.732 --> 18:31.402
<i>At high doses, it works like
a mild opioid painkiller.</i>

18:31.444 --> 18:35.031
<i>These alkaloids affect what is called
the Mu Opioid Receptor.</i>

18:35.073 --> 18:38.117
<i>That's in your brain. What else does it do?</i>

18:38.158 --> 18:41.079
<i>Well, nothing that's actually been
studied on humans,</i>

18:41.120 --> 18:43.456
<i>but it's been reported
to lower blood pressure,</i>

18:43.497 --> 18:46.084
<i>relieve pain, boost metabolism,</i>

18:46.125 --> 18:49.087
<i>improve your immune system, ease anxiety,</i>

18:49.128 --> 18:51.672
<i>help with addiction, eliminate stress,</i>

18:51.714 --> 18:54.592
<i>prevent diabetes, induce healthy sleep,</i>

18:54.634 --> 18:56.761
<i>and improve sexual energy.</i>

18:56.803 --> 18:59.889
<i>These statements have not been evaluated</i>
<i>by the FDA.</i> We were talking about, what,

19:01.975 --> 19:05.061
I think we say, kratom?

19:05.103 --> 19:06.938
- [Shane Mauss] Yeah, yeah.
- It's called kratom.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.982
I'm gonna take some right now.

19:09.023 --> 19:13.152
It takes, like, an hour to kick in, and so...
And this is a very mild dose.

19:13.193 --> 19:17.281
It is 12:23. At 1:23, I'm going to start
asking weird questions.

19:17.323 --> 19:21.744
[Chris] <i> Comedian Shane Mauss used kratom
to help him after a nasty accident.</i>

19:21.786 --> 19:26.040
About three years ago, I was out hiking.
Best shape of my life.

19:26.082 --> 19:30.169
<i>And I jumped off a thing
that was much too high.</i>

19:30.210 --> 19:34.632
And I broke both my heels,
one of them exploded.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.884
Had to crawl down a mountain for a few hours.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.178
That's doctor's words, is that it exploded.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.973
I was like, "Really? That's your diagnosis?"

19:42.015 --> 19:44.266
[laughs] Says my heel exploded.

19:44.308 --> 19:47.979
- [Chris] They must have had you on opioids, right?
- They did, yeah.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.356
I remember the day I got
my first shot of morphine,

19:50.397 --> 19:53.109
and right away, I was like, "Whoa! I get it."

19:53.151 --> 19:55.361
"I get why people like this."

19:55.402 --> 19:58.238
I don't understand how
both of my feet are broken

19:58.280 --> 20:02.743
and this is the best I've ever felt
in my entire life.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.996
I don't see how that's a legal thing.

20:05.038 --> 20:08.749
This is all pretty numb in here.
It's coming back.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.417
It feels better all the time.

20:10.459 --> 20:15.339
The reason why I'm wearing these
baby-skinned bootsies

20:15.381 --> 20:17.925
is because my girlfriend
picked them out for me.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.971
- And she controls the puss distribution.
- [audience laughing]

20:22.013 --> 20:28.019
I was just complaining about my dumb foot
to a bunch of comics,

20:28.061 --> 20:31.022
and they were like, "Oh, you should go
to the kratom bar,"

20:31.064 --> 20:32.523
and I was like, "What's that?"

20:33.482 --> 20:34.942
They're like, "Oh, it's this...

20:34.984 --> 20:37.444
It's supposed to be good for pain relief,

20:37.486 --> 20:40.406
and it's some natural thing.

20:40.447 --> 20:42.783
<i>And you can go to a bar and drink it."</i>

20:42.825 --> 20:47.580
<i>And I found out that it's legal, and I
was like, "Eh, it's probably no good."</i>

20:52.919 --> 20:55.922
Roots and leaves in a traditional bilo cup.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.382
That's Komodo. That's our bestseller.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.599
[Chris exclaims]

21:06.640 --> 21:10.186
[James Scianno] Earthy notes
with an oaky finish, huh?

21:10.228 --> 21:12.312
Oh, that was bad. Ugh.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.857
[Chris] <i> Earthy notes means
it tastes like dirt.</i>

21:14.899 --> 21:18.402
<i>But after about 30 minutes, I began noticing
that I was more focused,</i>

21:18.444 --> 21:21.781
<i>more alert, and more important, out of pain.</i>

21:21.822 --> 21:25.659
And all of a sudden, I could walk
like a normal person.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.370
Like, I hadn't walked so
well since my accident

21:28.412 --> 21:32.750
in two-and-a-half years, or whatever it was
at that point.

21:32.792 --> 21:37.922
And I was like, "This is amazing.
What is this stuff?"

21:37.964 --> 21:43.302
There was one other place, a head shop
in Chicago, which sold it in 2006.

21:43.343 --> 21:45.721
Then we started. You know, we were looking
for different herbs.

21:45.763 --> 21:50.726
That's what we sell here, raw indigenous herbs
and beverages.

21:50.768 --> 21:52.603
And then we try kratom, and people are like,

21:52.645 --> 21:54.396
"Hey, what was that stuff you had?"

21:54.438 --> 21:56.107
<i>And we started ordering it.</i>

21:56.149 --> 21:59.777
You're basically just grinding raw leaf...

21:59.819 --> 22:02.947
- put it in water, or juice, or whatever,
- Yep. Kava.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.406
- [Chris] <i> And yeah, kava.</i>
- [Scianno] <i> Kava root.</i>

22:04.448 --> 22:06.075
[Chris] <i> Just making drinks, right?</i>

22:06.117 --> 22:08.786
[Scianno] <i> It's as raw as you get,</i>
<i>it's raw as you get.</i>

22:08.828 --> 22:10.537
[Chris] <i> What's it do for you?</i>

22:10.579 --> 22:14.374
It's, like, a calm energy you can
get, just a focused, clear mind.

22:14.416 --> 22:17.962
It's relaxing, but it's stimulating
at the same time.

22:18.004 --> 22:21.507
It's nice to come here and have a place to go
instead of going to the bar.

22:21.548 --> 22:25.636
- Exactly, just somewhere to go, mellow. So...
- [Chris] Yeah.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.221
How often do you come here?

22:27.263 --> 22:30.975
Um, I come here kind of every day.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.768
I used to take Adderall.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.395
I don't take it anymore. I took it all through
growing up and stuff.

22:35.437 --> 22:38.649
Yeah, it just takes the edge off in general,
you know.

22:38.691 --> 22:43.361
If you're feeling kinda tense, which
I usually am for whatever reason.

22:43.403 --> 22:46.740
[Chris] <i> Wow, kratom looks like a game changer.</i>

22:46.782 --> 22:51.037
<i>But then I turned on the news, and things
started looking a little different.</i>

22:51.078 --> 22:56.917
<i>I should have known, if something sounds
too good to be true, it probably is.</i>

22:56.959 --> 22:59.503
...Feds gearing up for a kratom crackdown.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.005
Don't know the drug?

23:01.047 --> 23:03.381
You should. You can actually
buy it in stores right now.

23:03.423 --> 23:06.052
[reporter] <i> It comes in
pills, powder, and liquid.</i>

23:06.093 --> 23:10.931
<i>And in one month, the DEA is ordering kratom
off all store shelves,</i>

23:10.973 --> 23:12.975
<i>putting it on the same level as heroin.</i>

23:13.017 --> 23:15.519
Kratom can be purchased
over the counter right now,

23:15.561 --> 23:17.021
but in a month, it'll be illegal.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.522
Dave, right now it looks like I'm holding

23:18.564 --> 23:20.941
a vitamin supplement, but a month from now,

23:20.983 --> 23:23.861
this will look an awful lot
like felony possession.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.655
[Chris] <i> On August 30th, 2016,</i>

23:26.697 --> 23:30.117
<i>the DEA issued a notice of
an intent to ban kratom.</i>

23:30.159 --> 23:33.120
The FDA has decided

23:33.162 --> 23:37.041
it's in Schedule I, therefore,
because it has no medical value,

23:37.083 --> 23:39.335
there is a high potential for abuse.

23:39.377 --> 23:40.711
And most importantly,

23:40.753 --> 23:43.589
<i>we're now getting data from
folks around the country,</i>

23:43.630 --> 23:46.342
<i>that people are dying from kratom overdoses.</i>

23:46.384 --> 23:48.135
[Chris] <i> They cited 15 deaths</i>

23:48.177 --> 23:50.888
<i>and over 600 calls to poison control centers,</i>

23:50.930 --> 23:53.391
<i>which deemed it a national health emergency.</i>

23:54.892 --> 23:57.103
[dramatic music playing]

23:58.729 --> 24:01.815
- [officer] Freeze!
- [gasps] Hey, guys, guys, it's only vitamins.

24:01.857 --> 24:05.778
[Chris] <i> The DEA said they wanted
no public opinion on the matter.</i>

24:05.819 --> 24:09.115
<i>But we live in the era of
Twitter and Joe Rogan.</i>

24:09.156 --> 24:11.742
<i>And the Internet responded.</i>

24:11.784 --> 24:15.371
And apparently it helps a lot of people
that have heroin addiction problems

24:15.413 --> 24:16.830
and opioid addiction problems.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.292
And now, all of a sudden,
people are going to have to go

24:19.333 --> 24:21.835
right back to finding
whatever they used to take.

24:21.877 --> 24:25.714
Go to the link below to find your senator
and drop them an email tonight.

24:25.756 --> 24:27.841
But the worst thing the DEA said to me was,

24:27.883 --> 24:30.136
where they noted that their biggest concern
with kratom

24:30.177 --> 24:34.640
was the fact that some people were using it
as an alternative to heroin and opioids.

24:36.392 --> 24:39.561
No fucking shit.

24:39.603 --> 24:42.315
I'm Kristin Jacobs, mayor of Broward County...

24:42.356 --> 24:44.650
[Chris] <i> But not everybody is so pro-kratom.</i>

24:44.691 --> 24:46.693
<i>Meet Kristin Jacobs.</i>

24:46.735 --> 24:49.322
<i>She's on a mission to ban kratom in Florida.</i>

24:49.363 --> 24:51.615
<i>And it looked like she was doing
a pretty good job.</i>

24:51.657 --> 24:53.867
[reporter] <i> Broward State
representative Kristin Jacobs</i>

24:53.909 --> 24:55.911
<i>even compares it to heroin.</i>

24:55.953 --> 25:01.125
So, I think it is a tragedy what's happening
in this country, the addiction.

25:01.167 --> 25:04.628
And the stigma that's associated with it,
and the cost of recovery.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.756
And the horrific withdrawal
that you go through.

25:07.798 --> 25:11.427
It's a horrible, horrible
thing to have to experience.

25:11.469 --> 25:13.637
I promised you that by today,

25:13.679 --> 25:16.807
I would basically send around a blizzard
of information

25:16.849 --> 25:20.394
as many of you have not heard
of the word kratom before.

25:20.436 --> 25:25.024
To me, the effects of kratom mimic the effects
of opioid drugs.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.608
This is not prescribed.

25:26.650 --> 25:29.903
This has not been tested by the Food and Drug
Administration.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.198
In detox, several people offer kratom.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.908
I will tell you, it is harder to
detox somebody off of kratom,

25:34.950 --> 25:36.576
than it is to detox somebody off of heroin.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.537
And then they also say
that it is not addictive.

25:39.579 --> 25:41.457
It's no more addictive than a cup of coffee.

25:41.499 --> 25:44.626
But when you talk to doctors and you talk
to the scientists,

25:44.668 --> 25:46.753
and you talk to those epidemiologists

25:46.795 --> 25:49.048
that have been following this drug
and the claims of others,

25:49.089 --> 25:51.591
you see that, in fact,
those claims are not true.

25:51.633 --> 25:54.678
And then you start to talk
to people who've used it,

25:54.720 --> 25:57.848
- people who've lost loved ones too.
- Sure.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.641
And their stories are significantly different.

25:59.683 --> 26:02.811
Is there a way to keep this on the market
while we research it more?

26:02.853 --> 26:05.523
You know what, I understand when
someone's addicted to a drug,

26:05.563 --> 26:07.565
they don't want someone to
come take the drug away.

26:07.607 --> 26:09.318
The pain of recovery

26:09.360 --> 26:12.696
and withdrawals from any drug is
a horrific thing to go through,

26:12.738 --> 26:15.074
- and it's a horrific thing for any family to see.
- Sure.

26:15.115 --> 26:17.284
The fact that those that are using it,

26:17.326 --> 26:19.412
will tell you that it's not addictive

26:19.453 --> 26:21.080
and they can get off at any time,

26:21.121 --> 26:23.916
that's the voice of
addiction telling you that.

26:23.957 --> 26:26.252
Generally, what happens is

26:26.293 --> 26:29.422
the money that you need to buy those drugs
soon runs out,

26:29.463 --> 26:31.465
and so you start finding
other ways to find dollars.

26:31.507 --> 26:35.302
You may take it from your family
or other easier opportunities...

26:35.344 --> 26:37.054
I haven't read anything about that.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.931
I've researched this every single day
since we started this project.

26:38.972 --> 26:43.018
I haven't heard people stealing money or doing
anything, like, illegal,

26:43.060 --> 26:44.228
to get this drug.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.230
Now, that's unfortunate, that's unfortunate.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.148
'Cause I believe you'll
talk to someone tomorrow

26:48.190 --> 26:50.443
that has, that you'll
interview that did just that.

26:50.484 --> 26:53.153
He was stealing from the family.

26:53.195 --> 26:56.782
He'd already ripped me off
for, you know, 400 bucks,

26:56.823 --> 26:58.867
taken my debit card,

26:58.909 --> 27:01.161
<i>and he drove to the top of that overpass</i>

27:01.203 --> 27:03.663
<i>which was just a two-minute drive.</i>

27:03.705 --> 27:06.500
<i>He got out of the car, he
walked across the street,</i>

27:06.542 --> 27:08.668
to the south-bound side,

27:08.710 --> 27:11.629
took off his sandals and dove head first.

27:11.671 --> 27:13.257
[reporter] <i> Ian Mautner's autopsy report</i>

27:13.299 --> 27:16.218
<i>showed an unknown amount of
what's called mitragynine,</i>

27:16.260 --> 27:18.095
<i>the active ingredient in kratom.</i>

27:18.137 --> 27:20.638
<i>Also listed, a number of antidepressants.</i>

27:20.680 --> 27:23.016
<i>Linda believes it was Ian's addiction
to kratom</i>

27:23.058 --> 27:25.060
<i>that ultimately sent him over the edge.</i>

27:25.102 --> 27:27.229
[Mautner] <i>He was the kind of kid</i>
<i>that I could trust.</i>

27:27.271 --> 27:29.773
<i>He always told me everything.</i>

27:29.815 --> 27:31.900
<i>- We were super, super close.</i>
- [Chris] <i> Mm-hmm.</i>

27:31.942 --> 27:34.445
<i>And he invited me to the kava bar.</i>

27:34.487 --> 27:38.532
He was spending a lot of money there,
like about 50 bucks a day.

27:38.574 --> 27:41.118
<i>And when I went there, I
didn't know what kratom was.</i>

27:41.160 --> 27:42.744
<i>You know, I had a drink...</i>

27:42.786 --> 27:44.955
<i>A couple of times I went down there
and had a drink.</i>

27:44.997 --> 27:47.416
I actually called my sponsor

27:47.458 --> 27:50.752
and I said, "You know, I tried this stuff.
Ian's doing this a lot."

27:50.794 --> 27:52.546
And she said, "You need to be careful,

27:52.588 --> 27:54.798
you know, because that doesn't sound good."

27:54.840 --> 27:57.675
- So, how long have you been sober for?
- For 22 years now.

27:57.717 --> 27:59.470
- Congratulations. That's amazing.
- Thanks.

27:59.512 --> 28:03.015
And I said, "Ian, if you're doing drugs,
this is really bad",

28:03.056 --> 28:05.434
because it can trigger the brain,

28:05.476 --> 28:10.147
and set off things, you know, like
bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.358
And he said, "Mom, I'm not doing drugs."

28:12.399 --> 28:16.529
You know, and it was... It became like
fighting that was going on between us.

28:16.570 --> 28:20.115
I mean, he'd spend hours in the bathroom
picking his face,

28:20.157 --> 28:22.451
and one time the mirror even came off.

28:22.493 --> 28:25.912
You know, the bathroom wall detached.

28:25.954 --> 28:28.290
And why do you think he was picking his face?
Like, what was he doing?

28:28.332 --> 28:30.209
We thought it was meth.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.628
Like, sometimes he'd be so sedated

28:32.670 --> 28:35.631
that his eyes would roll back in his head.

28:35.673 --> 28:38.967
And he'd talk to me and he'd go, "Mother..."

28:39.009 --> 28:41.512
<i>- You know, and he'd nod off.</i>
- [Chris] <i> Yeah.</i>

28:41.554 --> 28:44.890
<i>- And that sounds more like a heroin...</i>
- [Mautner] Heroin...

28:44.931 --> 28:48.435
<i>Nodding off on, like, pills or something
like that. That's kinda very similar.</i>

28:48.477 --> 28:51.813
More important, you know,
important for parents,

28:51.855 --> 28:55.234
- he was on medication as well, right, for...
- Yes.

28:55.275 --> 28:59.154
- Psychological issues, right? So...
- Yes.

28:59.196 --> 29:02.408
If you're on medication and you're taking
something that affects your brain,

29:02.449 --> 29:06.161
then we're really, you know, kinda playing
Russian roulette there.

29:06.203 --> 29:08.830
You don't know what you're
getting into at all.

29:08.872 --> 29:12.251
I've been accused of everything,
from, you know, on blogs,

29:12.292 --> 29:15.462
from kicking my son out of the house
because he was gay.

29:16.213 --> 29:19.341
You know, that's...

29:19.383 --> 29:23.887
What's that got to do with it, you know?
That came out in therapy.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.806
This was a different person.
This was addiction.

29:26.848 --> 29:30.102
This was living in my house,
and I couldn't have that.

29:30.143 --> 29:33.146
You don't put any other stuff in your drink?

29:33.188 --> 29:36.024
- It's kava and kratom, right?
- It's as raw as you get.

29:36.066 --> 29:39.695
Because Linda Mautner told me that you guys
lace the drinks.

29:39.737 --> 29:43.532
And that's what made her son, you know,
jump off a bridge to commit suicide,

29:43.574 --> 29:46.034
which is a very tragic story.

29:46.076 --> 29:48.995
Well, Linda Mautner is consistently incorrect.

29:49.037 --> 29:53.125
<i>I knew him personally. I just see a mother
trying to make sense</i>

29:53.166 --> 29:56.795
<i>- out of something senseless. It doesn't make sense.</i>
- [Chris] <i> Yeah.</i>

29:56.836 --> 29:59.172
[Scianno] <i> But his cause
of death wasn't kratom.</i>

29:59.214 --> 30:01.508
She gets to go on the news,

30:01.550 --> 30:04.553
you know, sympathetic media, for
whatever reason, I don't know.

30:04.595 --> 30:06.680
I don't know whose behind it, or what.

30:06.722 --> 30:10.142
- But she gets to say whatever she wants to say.
- Mm-hmm.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.770
And you know, it's out there.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.397
So, kratom has a PR problem.

30:15.439 --> 30:21.779
Look, she told us... She was like,
"Well, you know, he died from kratom."

30:21.820 --> 30:25.574
"Uh, you sure?" Well, the first time
he checked into drug rehab,

30:25.616 --> 30:27.867
he had opioids in his system,

30:27.909 --> 30:30.412
the second time he checked into drug rehab,

30:30.454 --> 30:33.749
he had methamphetamines in his system.

30:33.791 --> 30:35.584
And he jumped off a bridge and killed himself.

30:35.626 --> 30:39.254
I mean, God bless her, but it's like, "Ma'am,

30:39.296 --> 30:41.923
your son didn't die from kratom."

30:41.965 --> 30:44.843
I went from smoking a
pack of cigarettes a day,

30:44.884 --> 30:47.971
drinking 20 Red Bulls a day,
doing 90 pain pills a day,

30:48.013 --> 30:50.265
<i>snorting seven grams of cocaine a day,</i>

30:50.307 --> 30:51.809
<i>banging a ton of porn stars a day...</i>

30:51.850 --> 30:54.894
I don't want to do anything, none of that.

30:54.936 --> 30:59.483
But, here's the thing, I am in so much pain
when I wake up.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.234
<i>But then I found kratom.</i>

31:01.276 --> 31:06.281
And my pain level, like I said,
went from a nine to a three.

31:06.323 --> 31:09.785
<i>There was an infant born with total addiction,</i>

31:09.827 --> 31:11.453
<i>so they were in withdrawal,</i>

31:11.495 --> 31:16.082
And the mother said the only thing that
she had ingested

31:16.124 --> 31:17.626
was the kratom.

31:17.668 --> 31:20.629
<i>But luckily, she had some of her kratom
with her.</i>

31:20.671 --> 31:22.798
<i>And so, they sent a sample to us,</i>

31:22.840 --> 31:26.218
and we found that the actual kratom sample

31:26.259 --> 31:29.429
was adulterated with the hydrocodone.

31:29.471 --> 31:32.349
I mean, in Sweden, there was definitely
a bunch of deaths

31:32.391 --> 31:35.728
because of this laced product
with O-Desmethyltramadol,

31:35.769 --> 31:38.605
which is a very potent synthetic opioid.

31:38.647 --> 31:40.566
And it seems pretty clear

31:40.607 --> 31:43.109
that the deaths are from that component,
and not from the Kratom itself.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.779
He has not died because of kratom,
you see. As I said just now,

31:45.821 --> 31:49.282
people have been using kratom in
Southeast Asia for more than 100 years.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.201
There have not been any mortality cases.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.871
Nobody has died using Kratom in Malaysia.

31:53.912 --> 31:57.207
The only deaths listed

31:57.249 --> 32:02.421
as associated with kratom
are polydrug situations,

32:02.462 --> 32:05.883
where a person was on multiple other illicit

32:05.924 --> 32:08.635
and/or prescription drugs when they died.

32:08.677 --> 32:11.597
It's not new, it's not synthetic.

32:11.638 --> 32:14.140
And the media is attaching onto this as new.

32:14.182 --> 32:17.728
<i>It's new to the United
States in the last 20 years,</i>

32:17.770 --> 32:19.396
<i>but it's been used in Southeast Asia</i>

32:19.438 --> 32:22.107
<i>over hundreds and thousands
of years, culturally,</i>

32:22.148 --> 32:23.567
<i>for medicinal purposes.</i>

32:23.609 --> 32:25.819
<i>And yet, here we have the DEA</i>

32:25.861 --> 32:29.155
<i>saying that there's no medicinal use
from this plant,</i>

32:29.197 --> 32:34.453
when every single one of our members
is getting medicinal benefit...

32:34.494 --> 32:36.204
What is the problem with kratom?

32:36.246 --> 32:39.999
Why is it so controversial? Why are
people so up in arms about it?

32:40.041 --> 32:41.919
That could go in so many different directions.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.880
And I think primarily what the problem is,

32:44.922 --> 32:47.006
it is competition

32:47.048 --> 32:52.220
<i>to some of the largest money-making industries
in the United States.</i>

32:52.262 --> 32:55.390
And I think that with the
media and the propaganda

32:55.432 --> 32:58.435
that they've been allowed
to spew to the public,

32:58.477 --> 33:00.103
which is based on exaggeration.

33:00.145 --> 33:04.733
People are believing that it is something
like illegal heroin,

33:04.775 --> 33:10.363
which is, to me, the biggest joke,
and yet, the saddest joke

33:10.405 --> 33:11.531
that I've ever heard.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.992
It's not the kind of thing that you crave

33:14.033 --> 33:16.995
and you feel like you have to go out
and seek.

33:17.036 --> 33:21.207
Because it's not the kind of thing
that you can escape your life from.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.877
That's the major difference to me.

33:23.919 --> 33:27.046
When I was on opioids, I
was using them to escape.

33:27.088 --> 33:29.508
It was a miserable existence.

33:29.549 --> 33:33.011
I was in my 30s. All my friends were getting
married and having children,

33:33.052 --> 33:36.181
I never was able to have children.
I was sick for ten years.

33:36.222 --> 33:41.770
We are people that just want a natural
alternative to prescription drugs.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.396
And this is what works for us.

33:43.438 --> 33:46.733
Also, interestingly, about 60% of our members

33:46.775 --> 33:49.569
have never even experienced
addiction in their lives.

33:49.611 --> 33:55.283
<i>They're just looking for an alternative
to pain medications.</i>

33:55.325 --> 33:57.703
[Chris] <i> I figured if I'm going
to continue to use kratom,</i>

33:57.744 --> 34:00.413
<i>I should probably consult with the people
that matter the most.</i>

34:00.455 --> 34:05.043
<i>My brother Smelly recently started using
kratom as a pre-workout supplement.</i>

34:05.084 --> 34:08.213
[Smelly] <i> I like it, and I like the
feeling of it. It felt pretty good.</i>

34:08.254 --> 34:09.840
[Chris] <i> What kind of feeling
do you get from it?</i>

34:09.882 --> 34:13.342
It just kind of almost gave me,
like, a sense of calmness,

34:13.385 --> 34:16.346
and maybe a little bit better focus even.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.097
Yeah, I wanted you guys to try it

34:18.139 --> 34:21.141
because I didn't want anybody to be scared
of what I was taking.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.061
- Like, it was one of the main reasons...
- Right.

34:23.101 --> 34:27.440
Uh, has it ever caused any
concern for you, or...

34:27.482 --> 34:30.235
It doesn't seem that powerful

34:30.275 --> 34:34.197
to have a negative impact on your life.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.949
You know, I guess that's what
we're talking about here

34:35.991 --> 34:38.201
when we're talking about addiction,

34:38.243 --> 34:40.786
like who cares if you're addicted
to lifting weights

34:40.829 --> 34:42.748
if it doesn't hurt anybody else.

34:42.789 --> 34:46.043
[Chris] <i> When you hurt your elbow,
you're kind of, you know, beat up.</i>

34:46.083 --> 34:47.585
<i>How do you cope with pain?</i>

34:47.627 --> 34:50.047
I usually just, I mean, I
usually just deal with it.

34:50.088 --> 34:53.884
You know, so, for now, I'm trying to actually,
like, listen to the doctors and stuff,

34:53.926 --> 34:56.219
and use my arm a little bit less.

34:56.261 --> 34:59.097
And try not to do any upper body exercises
at all.

34:59.138 --> 35:00.974
<i>You know, as long as I get back
to it at some point,</i>

35:01.016 --> 35:02.350
<i>it is what I love to do.</i>

35:02.392 --> 35:04.519
So, whether I have to have
a surgery or whatever,

35:04.561 --> 35:06.271
I'll deal with it at that point.

35:06.312 --> 35:09.066
You know, I've had one knee replacement,
two hip replacements.

35:09.148 --> 35:12.277
They've been fine, I have no problem.
I was riding my bike,

35:12.318 --> 35:15.614
between five and seven miles a day, you know,
and everything.

35:15.655 --> 35:18.909
And as I was going to hand a
guy a bag, I trip over a curb,

35:18.951 --> 35:21.661
and I get this groin pull somehow.

35:21.703 --> 35:23.789
<i>They gave me some hydrocodone
to take, you know.</i>

35:23.830 --> 35:25.624
<i>And that was helping.</i>

35:25.665 --> 35:27.876
<i>I'd take two in the morning, two
in the afternoon, two at night,</i>

35:27.918 --> 35:29.920
<i>but it was still really painful.</i>

35:29.962 --> 35:33.548
<i>Then you had given me some kratom, I think
it was... I can't remember exactly,</i>

35:33.590 --> 35:38.303
but from April on, I was fine. I
wasn't taking the hydrocodone anymore.

35:38.344 --> 35:39.930
I was taking that,

35:39.972 --> 35:41.807
and I was back to riding my bike.
I rode my bike all summer.

35:41.848 --> 35:44.851
And so, I've been taking two a day,

35:44.893 --> 35:46.144
it doesn't make me high.

35:46.185 --> 35:48.730
<i>I don't realize that I took it.</i>

35:48.772 --> 35:50.899
<i>But I'm always happy, I'm
always in a good mood.</i>

35:50.941 --> 35:54.736
<i>I've never really been a person
that was depressed or anything.</i>

35:54.778 --> 35:56.613
I mean, I hate to be cynical,

35:56.655 --> 35:59.616
but like everything in this country
is run by money.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.576
The government's not going
to do their research,

36:01.618 --> 36:04.245
and the pharmaceutical companies
aren't going to do the research,

36:04.287 --> 36:05.914
unless there's something in it for them.

36:05.956 --> 36:07.833
If there's something in it for the government,
they'll do it.

36:07.874 --> 36:10.209
If there's something in it for the
pharmaceutical companies, they'll do it.

36:10.251 --> 36:12.963
But if there's nothing in it for either
one of them, they won't put up the money.

36:13.005 --> 36:14.673
So, if you come up with something like that,

36:14.714 --> 36:16.466
you've got to come up with the studies.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.926
What do you have going on with you?

36:17.968 --> 36:19.928
Well, it's an entrapped nerve in my back

36:19.970 --> 36:22.848
that's making the pain go all the way down
into my leg,

36:22.889 --> 36:26.018
make me lose movement in my leg.

36:26.059 --> 36:29.395
And it's, like, 24/7 pain.

36:29.437 --> 36:32.941
Unless I'm sleeping, I don't know I have...
I don't have any pain.

36:32.983 --> 36:34.943
<i>Other than that, I have pain all the time.</i>

36:34.985 --> 36:38.030
<i>And I don't think people shouldn't
try something for pain.</i>

36:38.071 --> 36:41.574
<i>I just don't think they should take
more than they should.</i>

36:41.616 --> 36:43.994
And I think all of it, the kratom and all,

36:44.036 --> 36:45.244
I think they're trying to stop it

36:45.286 --> 36:47.622
because they're probably trying to make it,

36:47.664 --> 36:49.124
so they can sell it and make money.

36:49.166 --> 36:50.917
Why are you afraid to try it?

36:52.335 --> 36:55.296
- For pain? Um...
- Mm-hmm.

36:55.338 --> 36:59.968
I don't know, I just, I just never tried
any kind of...

37:00.010 --> 37:01.511
anything, and so...

37:01.553 --> 37:03.722
But if the doctor gave
it to you, you'd try it?

37:04.597 --> 37:06.391
I probably would.

37:06.432 --> 37:08.852
[Chris] <i> So, my mom was afraid to take Kratom.</i>

37:08.894 --> 37:10.770
<i>But my friend's mom didn't hesitate.</i>

37:10.812 --> 37:12.647
<i>This is Tony from the gym.</i>

37:12.689 --> 37:15.859
<i>His mother started taking kratom
to get off her hydrocodone,</i>

37:15.901 --> 37:18.570
<i>and a lot of the other pills
she's been prescribed.</i>

37:18.611 --> 37:20.739
- [Chris] You're 89 years old, huh?
- Yeah.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.949
- You look fantastic.
- Well, thank you.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.326
- Like a spring chicken, 89 years old, come on.
- [laughs]

37:25.368 --> 37:26.995
[Mrs. Porter] <i>Some days I feel like it.</i>

37:27.037 --> 37:29.998
- [Chris] <i> You started taking kratom recently, huh?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

37:30.040 --> 37:32.500
- Because I'm on a lot of medicines.
- I'm all ears.

37:32.542 --> 37:35.628
I'm on about 15 different medicines.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.964
<i>Levothyroxine,</i>

37:38.006 --> 37:40.926
<i>Benecol, Amlodipine,</i>

37:40.967 --> 37:43.970
<i>hydrochloride, hydrocodone,</i>

37:44.012 --> 37:46.973
<i>Prezolon, take calcium,</i>

37:47.015 --> 37:50.060
<i>the Prolia injection, twice a year.</i>

37:50.102 --> 37:53.813
I don't know a lot of people who
take as much medicine as I do.

37:53.855 --> 37:57.150
I have a sister, 91, and
she takes six pills day.

37:57.192 --> 38:00.445
- I'm just tired of pain.
- [Chris] Yeah.

38:00.486 --> 38:04.449
And if anything else can help me,

38:04.490 --> 38:08.036
<i>without me taking all of these medicines,
you know, I'd try.</i>

38:08.078 --> 38:11.248
[Chris] The DEA is trying to
make it a Schedule I drug.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.792
You know, on par with heroin,
and these other drugs.

38:13.833 --> 38:17.420
But, you've taken it, you don't
see it that way, do you?

38:17.462 --> 38:20.673
- Doesn't make you high?
- No, no.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.968
I do what I want to do.

38:23.009 --> 38:25.637
- Like always.
- [Chris] What kind of stuff do you do every day?

38:25.678 --> 38:27.430
Everything I want to.

38:27.472 --> 38:31.601
If it's nice outside, I'm outside in the yard
or whatever,

38:31.643 --> 38:34.395
<i>because if I'm just sitting, it's worse.</i>

38:34.437 --> 38:39.276
<i>If I move around or whatever,
then, you know, I feel better.</i>

38:39.317 --> 38:42.237
- [Chris] <i> If you're moving, you're not in pain?</i>
<i>- I'm in pain, yeah.</i>

38:42.279 --> 38:47.242
But I just learn to... I just don't
give into all of it.

38:47.284 --> 38:49.869
[Chris] <i> When the government tries
to ban something people want,</i>

38:49.911 --> 38:53.123
<i>the people band together
and march on Washington.</i>

38:53.165 --> 38:56.417
<i>Kratom advocates were able to get
120,000 people</i>

38:56.459 --> 38:59.587
<i>to sign a petition to keep Kratom legal.</i>

38:59.629 --> 39:02.590
<i>This march was the last-ditch effort
to get the DEA</i>

39:02.632 --> 39:05.343
<i>to put the brakes on a Schedule I ban.</i>

39:05.384 --> 39:07.846
- [cheering]
- We are Kratom!

39:07.887 --> 39:10.556
[all chanting] We are Kratom!

39:10.598 --> 39:14.477
[Chris] <i> When I went out to DC for the
Kratom march, I didn't know what to expect.</i>

39:14.519 --> 39:17.772
<i>But I met some very fascinating people
from all walks of life.</i>

39:17.814 --> 39:21.151
<i>And we had one thing in common, pain.</i>

39:21.193 --> 39:22.819
What do you guys hope comes out of this?

39:22.861 --> 39:25.571
That I get to keep Kratom in my life,
because it saved my life.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.240
I was pretty much suicidal

39:27.282 --> 39:29.326
<i>before my doctor... I went in there suicidal.</i>

39:29.367 --> 39:31.870
<i>I got pregnant actually, and I was sent
to the methadone clinic,</i>

39:31.911 --> 39:33.997
I had to have my daughter on methadone,

39:34.039 --> 39:38.543
which was a complete disaster pretty much.

39:38.584 --> 39:40.545
<i>It's a very emotional subject for me,</i>

39:40.586 --> 39:42.547
<i>I watched my daughter go through withdrawal
for six months afterwards.</i>

39:42.588 --> 39:48.136
[chanting] Kratom saves lives!

39:48.178 --> 39:50.388
I was on suboxone for four years straight.

39:50.429 --> 39:53.432
And they had led me to believe that suboxone
was a cure to addiction.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.144
They actually literally told me that,
this will cure you.

39:56.186 --> 39:59.147
Three years ago, I was bedridden.
Every day was a struggle.

39:59.189 --> 40:02.692
And now with kratom, I can live my life.
I can come here.

40:02.734 --> 40:07.947
I can do things without
being in so total pain.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.742
- I actually ended up having a grand mal seizure...
- Oh, wow.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.077
...from taking tramadol.

40:12.118 --> 40:13.619
<i>And I came across Kratom.</i>

40:13.661 --> 40:16.122
<i>I went from sitting in a rocking chair,</i>

40:16.164 --> 40:18.208
weeping and saying goodbye to my daughter

40:18.250 --> 40:20.210
because my wife and my daughter
were going to leave the next day.

40:20.252 --> 40:23.546
To being able to actually finish up
my service,

40:23.588 --> 40:25.215
and I still have my family.

40:25.257 --> 40:27.300
[woman] <i> I was on fentanyl for six years,</i>

40:27.342 --> 40:30.387
and thanks to kratom, I no
longer have to do that.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.056
I can choose to help myself naturally.

40:33.098 --> 40:36.142
And I have for a year been off fentanyl.

40:36.184 --> 40:40.188
I had about 15 years of my life
go by in a blur of opiates.

40:40.230 --> 40:42.690
And then, as I was kinda coming off it,

40:42.732 --> 40:45.693
dealing with... and just dragging,

40:45.735 --> 40:48.905
kratom just gave me the energy to pull my life
back together.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.991
And stop the cravings of opioids.

40:52.033 --> 40:56.037
OxyContin for breakthrough, oxycodone for
breakthrough, 15 milligrams of tramadol.

40:56.079 --> 40:58.456
- So, you were addicted to these...
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

40:58.497 --> 41:00.375
Yeah, I was going through withdrawal symptoms
when it stopped.

41:00.417 --> 41:02.752
And Kratom actually helped you get off of...

41:02.794 --> 41:06.089
Yeah, I reduced all of my pain medications.

41:06.131 --> 41:08.883
I was on tramadol for a long time,
for over seven years.

41:08.925 --> 41:11.428
[Chris] You go through a lot of pain? You're
a professional football player, right?

41:11.469 --> 41:12.804
Yeah, it's given me my life back.

41:12.845 --> 41:16.349
What is this DEA ban going
to mean to kratom users?

41:17.434 --> 41:19.852
It turns them into criminals,

41:19.894 --> 41:24.232
and drug dealers, and drug addicts,
and drug...

41:24.274 --> 41:29.112
It will mean, for a lot of people,
depression and suicide.

41:29.154 --> 41:32.449
[man] <i> So, I was deployed constantly.
I was home for a couple of months,</i>

41:32.490 --> 41:33.783
I'd get deployed again.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.244
I got out in 2007

41:36.286 --> 41:40.332
with PTSD so bad that every
time the phone rang,

41:40.373 --> 41:41.749
it set me off.

41:41.791 --> 41:43.960
I couldn't check the mail,
I wouldn't leave my house.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.921
- I lost myself because of medicines.
- Me too.

41:46.963 --> 41:50.091
I lost myself because of my service
to the country.

41:50.133 --> 41:52.260
I lost everything I was.

41:52.302 --> 41:56.681
But now I'm with Kratom, I've been given
a new lease on life.

41:56.722 --> 42:00.226
[Chris] <i> Drew Turner spent nine years deployed</i>
<i>for the US Navy.</i>

42:00.268 --> 42:02.354
<i>He was honorably discharged
when his shooting hand</i>

42:02.395 --> 42:05.064
<i>was smashed by a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay.</i>

42:05.106 --> 42:09.068
<i>He suffers from severe
PTSD and Meigs Syndrome,</i>

42:09.110 --> 42:13.572
<i>which causes uncontrollable facial tics,

42:13.614 --> 42:15.741
<i>Kratom is the only thing that works.</i>

42:15.783 --> 42:18.203
<i>Without it, his life is a living hell.</i>

42:18.244 --> 42:21.039
I wanted something where I
can get rid of the pain,

42:21.080 --> 42:22.499
and feel a little bit better,

42:22.540 --> 42:24.625
<i>but at least have some
energy to get my life back.</i>

42:24.667 --> 42:26.461
<i>My wife would help me get
out of bed in the morning.</i>

42:27.253 --> 42:29.297
I would go to the couch.

42:29.339 --> 42:33.051
And if she went into her office that day,

42:33.092 --> 42:35.261
when she came back, I was in the same place
she left me.

42:35.303 --> 42:37.514
You know, I may have accidents.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.391
- I couldn't get to the bathroom.
- Wow, really?

42:39.432 --> 42:42.394
[Turner] <i> I got to a point where
it was pretty much just hopeless.</i>

42:42.435 --> 42:44.937
When you hit that point of hopelessness,

42:44.979 --> 42:48.107
there is really two
directions I could have gone.

42:48.149 --> 42:50.943
- Keep trying, or end it all.
- Yeah.

42:50.985 --> 42:54.155
And I'll tell you one thing
I'm not going to be,

42:54.197 --> 42:56.241
is one of those 22 a day.

42:56.282 --> 43:00.328

<i>many experts say your body can't tell

<i>with bicycles, natural foods,
and herbs like kratom.</i>

43:15.843 --> 43:18.846
I feel forgotten, it's why we call it
"Forgotten, not gone."

43:18.888 --> 43:21.516
It was just the honest truth, you know.
They forgot about us.

43:21.558 --> 43:23.476
<i>Am I gonna be a broken vessel, or just</i>

43:23.518 --> 43:26.145
<i>join the ranks of every veteran
complaining about the obvious?</i>

43:26.187 --> 43:29.148
<i>They haven't been taking care of our veterans
since the '70s, right?</i>

43:29.190 --> 43:30.858
<i>They didn't take care of
our Vietnam air veterans.</i>

43:30.900 --> 43:32.818
<i>They didn't take care of the Gulf War.</i>

43:32.860 --> 43:35.071
<i>So, why am I still confused enough that...</i>

43:35.113 --> 43:37.490
- I'm baffled and I want to kill myself.
- [Chris] Yeah.

43:37.532 --> 43:40.201
I realized the VA's set up to do what they do,

43:40.243 --> 43:42.328
it's acute medicine, right? It's a hospital.

43:42.370 --> 43:45.290
When is the last time you went to the
hospital or had a breakthrough mentally?

43:45.331 --> 43:47.417
- Yeah.
- You go there to get drugs.

43:47.459 --> 43:49.085
<i>You know, a lot of the veterans who are coming</i>

43:49.127 --> 43:50.711
are over-medicated right now

43:50.753 --> 43:52.380
from the drugs they are taking at the VA.

43:52.422 --> 43:55.216
I think, at one point, we
kinda had 26 different

43:55.258 --> 43:57.343
- types of prescription medications.
- Wow.

43:57.385 --> 44:01.431
That I had, at one time, had
active prescriptions for.

44:01.473 --> 44:04.142
I'll spend weeks where I don't sleep.

44:04.183 --> 44:05.768
Pretty severe nightmares.

44:07.479 --> 44:10.565
You know, just everything that

44:10.607 --> 44:12.858
I can feel bad about, I feel bad about.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.652
I got addicted to my pain pills

44:14.693 --> 44:17.530
that they gave me through the VA for fibroids.

44:17.572 --> 44:19.740
Fortunately for me, mine was kind of monthly,

44:19.782 --> 44:22.660
and you know, here and
there, but for my husband,

44:22.701 --> 44:24.954
<i>- he is in constant pain.</i>
- [Chris] <i> Yeah.</i>

44:24.996 --> 44:26.331
[Kelley] <i> So, he just sucked it up,</i>

44:26.372 --> 44:28.916
<i>and I guess he just got
more and more depressed.</i>

44:28.958 --> 44:33.712
It got to the point one time where
I stole his last few pills.

44:33.754 --> 44:37.049
And, he went to look for his
pills and he didn't have any.

44:37.091 --> 44:40.303
I don't know what he was going through
at that time. And he was, like,

44:40.345 --> 44:41.804
moaning in agony.

44:41.846 --> 44:44.140
And I remember lying next to him, thinking,

44:44.182 --> 44:48.060
"Would he shut up, because he is messing up
my high?"

44:48.102 --> 44:52.023
But now, finding out about alternate forms
of healing, we are talking about kratom,

44:52.064 --> 44:54.484
that helped me just deal
with the pain a little bit.

44:54.526 --> 44:56.611
Just so I don't mentally get so far out

44:56.653 --> 44:58.695
that I'm doing something self-destructive.

44:58.737 --> 45:02.200
By the point where I started taking kratom,

45:02.241 --> 45:04.827
you know, I was mentally
and physically a mess.

45:04.869 --> 45:07.872
- Yeah.
- You know, you could roll me up, stick me in a garbage bag

45:07.913 --> 45:10.375
and put me out at the curb, and
that was about all I was good for.

45:10.416 --> 45:13.336
What are the side effects
that you get from kratom?

45:13.378 --> 45:15.129
[laughs]

45:16.464 --> 45:18.424
I smile a little too much.

45:18.466 --> 45:20.092
[laughs]

45:20.134 --> 45:22.595
- You are a liberal...
- I'm a liberal. I'm a liberal redneck,

45:22.637 --> 45:24.556
which people think is an
oxymoron, but it's not.

45:24.597 --> 45:27.475
I'm also not a unicorn. There are more of me.

45:27.517 --> 45:29.519
We do exist.

45:29.561 --> 45:32.438
[Chris] <i> Trae Crowder is a stand-up comedian</i>
<i>known as "The Liberal Redneck."</i>

45:32.480 --> 45:36.108
<i>His Youtube video about kratom
got over 200,000 views,</i>

45:36.150 --> 45:39.445
<i>and got a lot of people to sign
the petition to keep it legal.</i>

45:39.487 --> 45:41.030
This is kratom.

45:41.072 --> 45:43.282
It's a tea made from the leaves
of a plant related to coffee

45:43.324 --> 45:46.536
that has been consumed in Southeast Asia
for hundreds of years.

45:46.578 --> 45:49.622
It's the only tea I fuck with you can't get
at a chicken buffet.

45:49.664 --> 45:53.125
I found kratom. I had never heard of it,
you know,

45:53.167 --> 45:56.212
and as I started reading more and
more about it, I was like, okay,

45:56.254 --> 45:59.090
it's related to the coffee plant,

45:59.131 --> 46:02.468
you know, botanically. So, it gives you energy
and whatever else.

46:02.510 --> 46:05.555
<i>But it's not the, like, jittery
kind that caffeine is,</i>

46:05.597 --> 46:08.807
and I've become aware of

46:08.849 --> 46:11.561
the positive implications
the kratom can have for

46:11.603 --> 46:14.355
opiate addiction, which is

46:14.397 --> 46:16.232
an issue that is extremely personal to me.

46:16.274 --> 46:19.110
Yes, my mama cooks the best

46:19.151 --> 46:21.070
crystal meth you've ever had in your life.

46:21.112 --> 46:24.365
- [crowd laughing]
- So good.

46:24.407 --> 46:26.701
So good... That's a joke. I'm kidding.

46:26.743 --> 46:29.870
- [crowd laughing]
- Yeah. My mom will never cook meth.

46:29.912 --> 46:33.040
She sold pills, that's a totally
different thing.

46:33.082 --> 46:37.503
My mom had gotten wrapped
up in pills and opiates,

46:37.545 --> 46:40.632
and not just doing them, she sold them too.

46:40.673 --> 46:43.593
So, she got in trouble with the law
because of that, you know.

46:43.635 --> 46:46.178
She, like, you know, went to jail a couple
of times

46:46.220 --> 46:47.680
over the course of me growing up,

46:47.722 --> 46:49.682
and even when she wasn't in jail,

46:49.724 --> 46:52.351
she was, you know, strung out or whatever,

46:52.393 --> 46:54.061
so she just wasn't really around.

46:54.103 --> 46:56.105
What do you think the future holds for kratom?

46:56.147 --> 46:57.398
Do you think it's gonna get banned,

46:57.440 --> 46:59.024
do you think it's okay for now?

46:59.066 --> 47:00.526
- You think we're...
- I think

47:00.568 --> 47:02.320
that they will end up banning it.

47:02.361 --> 47:03.946
I think it will become illegal.

47:03.988 --> 47:05.531
It's a mild stimulant.

47:05.573 --> 47:07.325
It hits some of the same parts
of your brain that opiates do.

47:07.366 --> 47:10.161
So, a lot of addicts have been using it
to keep off of the hard shit,

47:10.202 --> 47:12.829
which does not sit well with the lizards
at the Pharma companies.

47:12.871 --> 47:14.540
Big Pharmas are one of those

47:14.582 --> 47:18.002
powerful lobbying entities in the country,

47:18.043 --> 47:20.212
and I just knew...

47:20.254 --> 47:23.341
I was like, "Oh, what, this
little plant that grows",

47:23.382 --> 47:24.634
- it can, you know...
- Sure.

47:24.676 --> 47:27.052
Can chop them off at
the knees, potentially.

47:27.094 --> 47:29.054
There's no way they're gonna let that happen.

47:29.096 --> 47:30.973
<i>This is where we have found ourselves,</i>

47:31.015 --> 47:33.810
<i>that we must regulate our own regulators</i>

47:33.850 --> 47:36.061
<i>and bring the truth about kratom to light.</i>

47:36.103 --> 47:37.938
[Chris] <i> Meet Travis Lowin.</i>

47:37.980 --> 47:41.818
<i>He is the executive director of

47:41.858 --> 47:44.028
<i>He's been involved in the

<i>manufacturing and analytical testing</i>

47:46.572 --> 47:49.450
<i>of herbal supplements for over a decade.</i>

47:49.492 --> 47:51.160
Is there a detrimental effect

47:51.202 --> 47:53.245
to a human being, short and long-term effect,

47:53.287 --> 47:55.540
as a result of using kratom?
And the answer is no.

47:55.581 --> 47:57.750
Through donations that we receive,

47:57.792 --> 47:59.794
<i>they'll fly me out to other states,</i>

47:59.836 --> 48:02.129
<i>and I meet with state representatives,</i>

48:02.171 --> 48:04.382
or senators, or whoever else it might be

48:04.423 --> 48:07.719
that's influential as far as
passing these bills, and so forth,

48:07.760 --> 48:10.095
to basically present the science, to present
the facts.

48:10.638 --> 48:12.223
Is it safe?

48:12.264 --> 48:15.184
You know, is this safe, like if someone was
to sit around,

48:15.226 --> 48:17.520
can someone really overdose on kratom?

48:17.562 --> 48:19.063
The answer is no.

48:19.104 --> 48:21.148
Like, do you... I mean, try overdosing
on coffee grains.

48:21.190 --> 48:24.193
- It's not gonna happen.
- What if a little kid found some pills and took 'em?

48:24.235 --> 48:26.362
If a kid found some pills and took 'em,

48:26.404 --> 48:28.406
he might be pretty excited.

48:28.447 --> 48:29.741
[Chris laughs]

48:29.782 --> 48:31.659
- And probably go play outside.
- It's not gonna...

48:31.701 --> 48:33.118
No, it's not gonna kill your kid.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.747
In Alabama, what's the big interest
in banning it?

48:35.788 --> 48:37.914
Like, what's the big, huge...

48:37.956 --> 48:43.003
Alabama has the largest
prescription painkiller use

48:43.045 --> 48:44.422
to any other state in the United States.

48:44.463 --> 48:46.758
Actually, the statistics show that

48:46.799 --> 48:48.718
there are more prescriptions

48:48.760 --> 48:52.597
<i>for painkillers than there
actually are people in Alabama.</i>

48:52.638 --> 48:55.266
The science is out, the studies
have been conducted.

48:55.307 --> 48:58.227
We've seen several hundred years
of safe traditional use.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.229
And the answer is, as far as addiction

49:00.271 --> 49:01.980
and habit-forming, anything can be that.

49:02.022 --> 49:05.401
Nacho cheese, Coca-Cola. Whatever you want.

49:05.443 --> 49:08.446
[Chris] <i> Big Food spends billions to make</i>
<i>our food more addictive.</i>

49:08.487 --> 49:10.030
<i>Sugar, fat, and salt</i>

49:10.072 --> 49:13.033
<i>have been shown to have a
synergistic addictive effect.</i>

49:13.075 --> 49:15.661
<i>Cheese even hits our opiate receptors.</i>

49:15.703 --> 49:18.163
<i>Not nearly as strong as opioid drugs,</i>

49:18.205 --> 49:20.165
<i>but it does the same thing.</i>

49:20.207 --> 49:22.251
<i>It leaves us wanting more.</i>

49:22.293 --> 49:25.296
<i>In the food world, it's all about the flavor,</i>

49:25.337 --> 49:27.339
<i>the texture, and the crunch.</i>

49:27.381 --> 49:30.967
<i>And there's a concept called
vanishing caloric density.</i>

49:31.009 --> 49:32.720
<i>If a food melts quickly,</i>

49:32.762 --> 49:34.764
<i>your brain thinks it has no calories,</i>

49:34.806 --> 49:36.557
<i>and you can eat it forever.</i>

49:36.599 --> 49:38.225
<i>Kinda like cheesy poofs.</i>

49:38.267 --> 49:40.645
<i>And companies study the hell out of it.</i>

49:40.686 --> 49:43.397
I actually have been
talking to a lot of people

49:43.439 --> 49:46.275
that use kratom to get off of opiates.

49:46.317 --> 49:48.486
We've seen it a lot, you know.

49:48.527 --> 49:51.280
Do you think that's, like,
kinda playing with fire?

49:51.322 --> 49:53.908
What do you think the problem is there?

49:53.950 --> 49:56.786
Well, I think there's several things
that need to be clear.

49:56.828 --> 49:59.996
First of all, to the degree that
it's completely unregulated,

50:00.038 --> 50:02.625
so, when someone says, "I'm taking kratom,
and I feel just fine."

50:02.667 --> 50:04.961
Really? How do you know what's in that packet?

50:05.001 --> 50:06.921
Because it's completely unregulated,

50:06.963 --> 50:09.590
you don't know if there's even any kratom
in there at all.

50:09.632 --> 50:11.592
[Chris] <i> Well, she could be right.</i>

50:11.634 --> 50:14.762
<i>There may not be any kratom in those packages.</i>

50:14.804 --> 50:18.724
<i>That sounds like the unregulated world
of dietary supplements.</i>

50:18.766 --> 50:21.727
<i>Ten years ago, I showed the world
how easy it was</i>

50:21.769 --> 50:24.313
<i>to make dietary supplements in my kitchen,</i>

50:24.355 --> 50:26.273
<i>and nobody could stop me.</i>

50:26.315 --> 50:30.402
<i>The problem is I can still
do that, until I get caught.</i>

50:30.444 --> 50:33.489
<i>Although it's the law, and people
are ingesting these pills,</i>

50:33.531 --> 50:37.159
<i>many companies just don't care,
and don't follow the rules.</i>

50:37.201 --> 50:39.912
Look, I know some of these manufacturers,

50:39.954 --> 50:44.333
and like, some of them just manufacture it
in their garage.

50:44.375 --> 50:47.795
They manufacture in their living room.

50:47.837 --> 50:50.130
They're packing capsules in their living room.

50:50.172 --> 50:52.800
They put it in a jar and they take
it to smoke shops and sell it.

50:52.842 --> 50:55.970
<i>I think there needs to be
some regulation on it.</i>

50:56.012 --> 51:01.266
<i>There has to be, you know, FDA compliant
companies that package it in a warehouse.</i>

51:01.308 --> 51:04.478
[Chris] <i> Lot of the packaging, on the back
it says, "Not for human consumption."</i>

51:04.520 --> 51:06.772
<i>What's the deal with that,
and why's that going on?</i>

51:06.814 --> 51:08.858
[Wiese] <i> I think it's because</i>

51:08.900 --> 51:10.818
<i>that's how they get it into the country.</i>

51:10.860 --> 51:12.778
<i>They don't wanna have it tested.</i>

51:12.820 --> 51:16.072
These fly-by-night companies, as I call them,

51:16.114 --> 51:18.200
that package it in their garage,

51:18.242 --> 51:21.412
they can't afford to send it off
to get it tested.

51:21.453 --> 51:23.789
Do you have more of an issue
with the industry or the DEA?

51:23.831 --> 51:25.666
Way more with the industry.

51:25.708 --> 51:29.045
Way more. The DEA/FDA, they're pretty
consistent about what they wanna do.

51:29.085 --> 51:30.337
They're just doing their job.

51:30.379 --> 51:31.505
Yeah, they're just doing their job,

51:31.547 --> 51:32.965
and they're doing it for a reason.

51:33.007 --> 51:34.926
They've got one of the toughest jobs
in the world.

51:34.967 --> 51:37.177
They have to ensure our food supply is safe.

51:37.219 --> 51:40.222
Or, you know, if there is a problem, they have
to step in to take care of it.

51:40.264 --> 51:43.726
The fact that this industry is not
regulated, is that an issue for you?

51:43.768 --> 51:46.979
It's a huge issue, I mean,
it's one of the most

51:47.021 --> 51:49.648
aggravating, frustrating
things that, we as a group,

51:49.690 --> 51:51.358
you know, the people that are
in this business,

51:51.400 --> 51:53.151
we get together, and we talk about
how do we make this better.

51:53.193 --> 51:54.695
How do we keep the longevity going?

51:54.737 --> 51:57.448
Everybody knows that every legislator
we've talked to,

51:57.489 --> 51:59.199
interacted with, everybody says

51:59.241 --> 52:02.078
the only way this stays is if we regulate it.

52:02.118 --> 52:04.496
Nobody's making the move towards regulation.

52:04.538 --> 52:06.540
For lack of better terminology,

52:06.582 --> 52:09.376
this industry operates like a bunch of
head shops, little fucking drug dealers.

52:09.418 --> 52:10.920
Nobody wants to work together.

52:10.962 --> 52:13.129
Everybody wants to do their own thing quietly.

52:13.171 --> 52:15.466
And we operate like a bunch of drug dealers.

52:15.507 --> 52:17.760
So, the rules in the supplement world say

52:17.802 --> 52:20.012
you're either an FDA-compliant label,

52:20.054 --> 52:22.431
or you are not for human consumption.

52:22.473 --> 52:24.391
You are an adulterated
product, you're not legal,

52:24.433 --> 52:25.935
you shouldn't be able to sell it,

52:25.977 --> 52:28.186
because the people don't have...

52:28.228 --> 52:30.522
I mean, the people have the right to know
what they're gonna ingest.

52:30.564 --> 52:32.817
And if you do not have FDA-compliant labeling,

52:32.858 --> 52:34.735
you're not disclosing what's in the package,

52:34.777 --> 52:36.361
whether it's safe, whether it's been
tested either.

52:36.403 --> 52:37.905
It's all about money, right? Comes down to...

52:37.947 --> 52:39.490
The majority of the vendors,

52:39.531 --> 52:41.909
every week, they post this
little list on Reddit

52:41.951 --> 52:43.953
where these guys are just the dirtbag

52:43.995 --> 52:46.622
of dirtbags trying to sell the cheapest kratom
out there.

52:46.664 --> 52:48.916
When we have conversations, "Why don't you
test your product?"

52:48.958 --> 52:51.002
- "Well, I would have to sell it for more."
- Yeah.

52:51.043 --> 52:54.212
"Or why don't you put this
through a pharmaceutical

52:54.254 --> 52:56.090
co-packer and get this done right?"

52:56.132 --> 52:57.967
"Well, I can't afford to do that."

52:58.009 --> 52:59.468
Then you shouldn't be in the business.

52:59.510 --> 53:01.720
- Sure.
- Then you got no right to be in this business.

53:01.762 --> 53:02.972
[Chris] <i> In the early '90s,</i>

53:03.014 --> 53:05.057
<i>FDA Commissioner David Kessler</i>

53:05.099 --> 53:08.769
<i>was concerned with the safety of
dietary supplements on the market.</i>

53:08.811 --> 53:12.314
<i>So, he proposed a plan that would
treat supplements more like drugs.</i>

53:12.356 --> 53:14.232
<i>To get approved by the FDA,</i>

53:14.274 --> 53:17.695
<i>a drug needs to meet both
safety and efficacy standards.</i>

53:17.736 --> 53:19.446
<i>But that would be really expensive</i>

53:19.488 --> 53:21.073
<i>and cut into the profit.</i>

53:21.115 --> 53:23.034
<i>Enter the DSHEA Act,</i>

53:23.075 --> 53:25.410
<i>spearheaded by Senator Orrin Hatch.</i>

53:25.452 --> 53:28.372
<i>He's from Utah, where they make about 80%</i>

53:28.413 --> 53:30.457
<i>of the world's dietary supplements.</i>

53:30.499 --> 53:32.292
<i>He thought it'd be crazy to require companies</i>

53:32.334 --> 53:33.794
<i>to do safety studies</i>

53:33.836 --> 53:36.505
<i>on those pills granny's
been poppin' for 50 years,</i>

53:36.547 --> 53:39.508
<i>so he created a Dietary Supplement Health
Education Act</i>

53:39.550 --> 53:41.177
<i>and rushed it through Congress...</i>

53:41.217 --> 53:43.261
[flushing]

53:43.303 --> 53:45.389
<i>On the last day of session.</i>

53:45.430 --> 53:48.350
<i>Any supplement created
and marketed in the U.S.</i>

53:48.392 --> 53:51.687
<i>as a dietary supplement before 1994,</i>

53:51.729 --> 53:53.814
<i>was grandfathered into the system.</i>

53:53.856 --> 53:57.109
<i>So, your vitamins from A to Zinc are safe.</i>

53:57.151 --> 54:00.404
Hey, we can live our dreams.

54:00.445 --> 54:03.866
<i>But how do we know what's on the label
is in the bottle?</i>

54:03.908 --> 54:05.159
<i>We don't.</i>

54:05.201 --> 54:07.494
<i>Enter GMP regulation.</i>

54:07.536 --> 54:11.082
<i>GMP just means Good Manufacturing Practices.</i>

54:11.123 --> 54:13.584
<i>It means products must prove their purity</i>

54:13.625 --> 54:15.502
<i>and test for things like mold,</i>

54:15.544 --> 54:18.547
<i>bacteria, salmonella, and E. coli.</i>

54:18.589 --> 54:21.092
<i>According to a recent episode of</i> Frontline,

54:21.133 --> 54:22.885
<i>because of the DSHEA Act,</i>

54:22.927 --> 54:27.347
<i>the supplement industry boomed to
over 85,000 products on the market,</i>

54:27.389 --> 54:30.142
<i>from over 4,000 manufacturers.</i>

54:30.184 --> 54:33.437
<i>And the FDA only has a team of 25 people</i>

54:33.478 --> 54:35.064
<i>to police it.</i>

54:35.106 --> 54:38.234
<i>Only a small portion of supplements
ever get checked on.</i>

54:38.316 --> 54:39.985
<i>So, should we even be concerned</i>

54:40.027 --> 54:42.238
<i>that kratom isn't part of this broken system?</i>

54:44.698 --> 54:47.283
<i>Or should we be looking for a new system?</i>

54:47.325 --> 54:49.203
You know, it's significant. People are putting
these products

54:49.245 --> 54:51.247
in their body. They're adulterated products,

54:51.287 --> 54:52.539
and there is a health risk,

54:52.581 --> 54:54.250
public health risk imparted into that,

54:54.290 --> 54:55.751
and that's where our concern lies.

54:55.793 --> 54:57.628
[Chris] <i> This is Daniel Fabricant.</i>

54:57.669 --> 54:59.922
<i>He's the CEO of the Supplement Lobby Group</i>

54:59.964 --> 55:02.258
<i>and Natural Products Association.</i>

55:02.298 --> 55:05.219
<i>Yet, he won't accept kratom
as a natural product.</i>

55:05.261 --> 55:07.012
You wanna still have kratom on the market.

55:07.054 --> 55:08.931
I like it, I use it, you know, for pain.

55:08.973 --> 55:10.808
- So I like it.
- I think you go to...

55:10.849 --> 55:13.018
For pain, now pain is gonna
be into the drug side.

55:13.060 --> 55:14.186
- Sure.
- Okay.

55:14.228 --> 55:15.771
So, if you wanna use it for chronic pain,

55:15.813 --> 55:17.815
you go to those kratom manufacturers

55:17.856 --> 55:19.858
and you go, "Hey, you guys have
to develop this as a drug."

55:19.900 --> 55:21.110
But I don't wanna be on a drug.

55:21.152 --> 55:22.861
- I just wanna take the natural plant.
- Okay.

55:22.903 --> 55:24.571
Chris, Chris,

55:24.613 --> 55:26.573
the point is you're making a drug claim,
that makes it a drug,

55:26.615 --> 55:29.367
by law, 'cause you're treating something.

55:29.409 --> 55:31.745
<i>Now, that's the real issue here.</i>

55:31.787 --> 55:33.872
<i>Its intended use is everything.</i>

55:33.914 --> 55:36.583
And if the intended use is as a drug,
well, then you go that process.

55:36.625 --> 55:38.252
If the intended use is as a food...

55:38.294 --> 55:40.462
If you said, "Hey, Dan, I
just wanna use it because

55:42.089 --> 55:44.133
<i>I'm in a better mood when I use it.</i>

55:44.175 --> 55:46.010
<i>I feel, you know, slightly better."</i>

55:46.051 --> 55:47.886
<i>Not that you have anxiety
or anything else like that,</i>

55:47.928 --> 55:49.638
<i>but, you know, you're a healthy person,</i>

55:49.680 --> 55:52.557
<i>and you wanna help elevate your mood.</i>

55:52.599 --> 55:54.392
<i>Well, then that would be</i>

55:54.434 --> 55:58.522
the food or the supplement route.
Again, that requires that safety study.

55:58.563 --> 56:00.482
There's no special exemption.

56:00.524 --> 56:02.734
My daughter also thinks that when I
kiss her finger and she has a boo-boo,

56:02.776 --> 56:04.444
that it helps it heal.

56:04.486 --> 56:06.571
Well, my lips aren't getting
approved by the FDA anytime soon,

56:06.613 --> 56:08.115
no matter how much she believes that.

56:08.157 --> 56:11.076
It's an issue that gets brought
up and everybody goes,

56:11.118 --> 56:12.494
"It's addiction, right?"

56:12.536 --> 56:13.996
And then everybody goes,
"Well, what about caffeine,

56:14.038 --> 56:16.123
what about alcohol, what about tobacco?"

56:16.165 --> 56:17.373
I guess, what about all that stuff?

56:17.415 --> 56:19.668
Alcohol is regulated one way.

56:19.710 --> 56:21.879
We don't let people, you
know, under 21 have it.

56:23.421 --> 56:26.925
Hello... Mindy.

56:26.967 --> 56:29.303
But you also have data with regards to the use
of alcohol

56:29.345 --> 56:30.470
and things like that.

56:31.096 --> 56:32.139
Tobacco, similarly.

56:32.181 --> 56:33.891
Tobacco is regulated now by FDA,

56:33.932 --> 56:36.518
Center for Tobacco Products.

56:36.560 --> 56:39.104
There are also products that have been
approved by the FDA on the drug side

56:39.146 --> 56:41.648
to help you overcome nicotine addiction.

56:41.690 --> 56:44.400
So, you know, again, I think with both
of those areas,

56:44.442 --> 56:47.196
and I'm certainly not advocating the use of

56:47.238 --> 56:49.198
tobacco or alcohol,

56:49.240 --> 56:51.075
- but there's...
- Sure. [laughs]

56:51.116 --> 56:52.492
...there's a scientific base.

56:52.534 --> 56:54.619
- Yeah.
- And I think that's where

56:54.661 --> 56:56.496
you know, where some of the issues are.

56:56.538 --> 56:59.415
I just wanna see people, no matter whatever
they're selling,

57:00.251 --> 57:02.002
whether it's the industry,

57:02.044 --> 57:03.837
whether it's FDA,

57:03.879 --> 57:07.674
whether it's, you know, someone in
the industry with a new product.

57:07.716 --> 57:10.177
There's a system there. Use a system,
use it appropriately.

57:10.219 --> 57:11.720
We're gonna promote the
use of natural products.

57:11.762 --> 57:13.180
It doesn't help anybody when...

57:13.222 --> 57:15.349
- Sure.
- ...people are, you know, selling things that,

57:16.600 --> 57:18.394
with claims that make them drugs.

57:18.435 --> 57:21.313
[Chris] <i> I think what we have here</i>
<i>is a vocabulary problem,</i>

57:21.355 --> 57:22.981
<i>not a drug problem.</i>

57:23.023 --> 57:26.193
<i>The powers that be classify kratom
by its intended use.</i>

57:26.235 --> 57:27.736
<i>So, according to the law,</i>

57:27.778 --> 57:30.114
<i>if your intention is to elevate your mood,</i>

57:30.155 --> 57:32.449
<i>or stay awake, then it's totally fine,</i>

57:32.490 --> 57:35.535
<i>and you can sell it as a supplement
at a gas station</i>

57:35.577 --> 57:37.662
<i>with all sorts of claims on the bottle.</i>

57:37.704 --> 57:40.374
<i>But if your intention is to get out of pain,</i>

57:40.416 --> 57:41.959
<i>or to get off of opiates,</i>

57:42.000 --> 57:43.961
<i>all of a sudden, it's a drug,</i>

57:44.002 --> 57:46.255
<i>and it will require years of studies,</i>

57:46.297 --> 57:49.383
<i>and costs, on average, a billion dollars
to get to market.</i>

57:49.425 --> 57:51.009
<i>Same exact substance.</i>

57:51.051 --> 57:54.179
The way that this works is you actually
train the animals

57:54.221 --> 57:55.472
to press a lever

57:55.513 --> 57:57.057
so many times, and after so many times,

57:57.099 --> 57:59.017
<i>they get an injection of morphine.</i>

57:59.059 --> 58:01.686
<i>They can get food or they can get drug,</i>

58:01.728 --> 58:03.855
<i>and they can choose between one or the other,</i>

58:03.897 --> 58:05.232
<i>and they usually end up</i>

58:05.274 --> 58:06.817
<i>choosing the drug.</i>

58:06.858 --> 58:09.069
[Chris] <i> It makes addiction
sound so simple, it's like,</i>

58:09.111 --> 58:10.946
<i>you hit this, you get a reward,</i>

58:10.988 --> 58:12.489
<i>I like it, I'm gonna do it again.</i>

58:12.530 --> 58:14.532
[McCurdy] <i> Unfortunately,
addiction as a disease,</i>

58:14.574 --> 58:17.328
is that simple. A lot of people say
it's a choice.

58:17.369 --> 58:21.248
I, honestly, don't believe it's ever a choice,

58:21.290 --> 58:22.833
except for maybe the first time.

58:22.874 --> 58:25.794
The people that are anti-kratom,
I should say,

58:25.836 --> 58:29.006
are saying like, "Look, if it's so good,
why isn't pharma coming after it?"

58:29.047 --> 58:31.425
I know exactly why pharma
isn't going after it.

58:31.467 --> 58:32.884
Because you can't get a patent around it.

58:32.926 --> 58:36.013
<i>We filed a patent for use as a treatment</i>

58:36.054 --> 58:38.723
<i>for any kind of drug withdrawal.</i>

58:38.765 --> 58:41.393
- [Chris] And it didn't go through?
- It didn't go through.

58:41.435 --> 58:44.480
Actually, we met with more rejections from
the U.S. Patent Office

58:44.521 --> 58:47.232
<i>than our patent attorneys
said they've ever seen.</i>

58:47.274 --> 58:49.026
[Singh] People have this perception that

58:49.067 --> 58:51.362
regular kratom use could actually cause

58:51.403 --> 58:54.365
serious dependence, and then you abstain
from kratom use,

58:54.406 --> 58:57.075
it leads to severe withdrawal symptoms.

58:57.117 --> 58:58.660
I don't think so.

58:58.702 --> 59:02.206
The only thing is, you need
to know how to use kratom

59:02.247 --> 59:04.082
correctly, because in America,

59:04.124 --> 59:06.835
I believe that people don't
really know how to use kratom.

59:06.877 --> 59:09.505
So, you think that we're just
scraping the surface here?

59:09.546 --> 59:11.840
<i>You think that we can actually go further,</i>

59:11.882 --> 59:14.885
<i>- if we start learning how to properly use this.
- Exactly. Exactly.</i>

59:14.926 --> 59:17.221
<i>If they can come, we can all come together</i>

59:17.262 --> 59:18.680
- and do good science.
- Exactly.

59:18.722 --> 59:20.807
And you know, provide some kind of funding

59:20.849 --> 59:22.226
to Christopher McCurdy,

59:22.267 --> 59:24.353
then we can actually do good science,

59:24.395 --> 59:27.189
because I see it now, kratom
has negative picture.

59:27.231 --> 59:29.774
The government is not gonna
provide any funding.

59:29.816 --> 59:33.237
It is difficult because, as I said,
we are at the initial stage.

59:33.278 --> 59:35.864
And you get to see kratom-using population
is growing,

59:35.906 --> 59:37.824
and growing, and growing, and growing.

59:37.866 --> 59:41.495
You have a PhD in addiction. Have you
seen people die from crystal meth?

59:41.537 --> 59:43.747
- Of course, I've seen...
- Have you seen people die from heroin?

59:43.788 --> 59:44.915
Of course, I've seen.

59:44.956 --> 59:47.042
And zero from kratom? [chuckles]

59:47.084 --> 59:49.711
From kratom, I've not seen any
serious medical problems.

59:49.753 --> 59:50.962
Dr. Holcomb,

59:51.004 --> 59:53.257
next, you're a board-certified
general surgeon,

59:53.298 --> 59:57.886
practicing physician, who,
at first, was against

59:57.928 --> 01:00:00.264
kratom, but your personal experience

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:02.933
with your son changed your opinion.

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:06.228
[Chris] <i> Dr. Murray Holcomb is a
general surgeon in Austin, Texas.</i>

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:09.147
<i>His son, Grant, battled addiction
and depression.</i>

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:11.942
<i>And when he got out of rehab, he found kratom.</i>

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:14.778
<i>Which seems to be the one thing
that really helps him.</i>

01:00:14.819 --> 01:00:17.114
He's up in the tree, so...

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:18.949
- Oh, he's up there.
- Yeah.

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:21.952
[Grant] <i> I got a DWI, and I totaled my car</i>

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:24.162
just, like, five days before
I went into treatment.

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:27.624
So, it wasn't your typical intervention

01:00:27.665 --> 01:00:29.709
where I walked in, like,

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.962
they had planned it out or anything like that.

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:34.923
[Murray] Addiction later became
a significant part of that.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.133
Although,

01:00:37.384 --> 01:00:41.221
probably more often than not,

01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:43.557
addiction with issues that...

01:00:43.599 --> 01:00:45.767
Or medications that were
prescribed by other physicians.

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:48.520
I had a really bad leg injury in high school,

01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:50.063
<i>wrecked a four-wheeler,</i>

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:53.066
<i>and snapped my leg, you know, like, thirds,</i>

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:56.736
so, that's the first time I was introduced to
you know, painkillers.

01:00:56.778 --> 01:00:58.655
What were your days like back then?

01:00:58.696 --> 01:01:00.657
[Grant] <i> Take two swigs off the bottle</i>

01:01:00.698 --> 01:01:03.076
<i>that was next to my bed on the nightstand.</i>

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:04.911
<i>Pop a couple of my Xanax.</i>

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:07.122
Do that just so I would be able to go to work,

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:09.291
so I could get myself out of bed,

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:10.584
and go to work,

01:01:10.626 --> 01:01:13.504
and work a full day,

01:01:13.545 --> 01:01:16.507
<i>but, throughout that day,
popping pills as needed.</i>

01:01:16.548 --> 01:01:19.884
Kinda get myself through
that, and then buy a bottle

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:21.845
and work on finishing it.

01:01:21.886 --> 01:01:25.849
One in five adults will experience
a mental health issue

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.309
in any given year.

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:30.521
One in 25, approximately, are
severe mental health issues.

01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:32.606
It interferes with their ability
to function,

01:01:32.648 --> 01:01:35.108
or is disruptive to their life.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:39.904
Thirteen percent of the population
is on antidepressants.

01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:43.992
I'd happened to visit a shop that had
kratom behind the counter.

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:46.203
<i>I decided, in a good way,</i>

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:48.997
<i>to try that before I got to the hotel room</i>

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:51.041
and got a bottle or anything like that.

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:54.503
And from that first day that I took it again,

01:01:54.545 --> 01:01:58.089
and it had been probably two or three years
since I had taken it,

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:01.677
that desire to get my hands
on drugs or alcohol,

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.136
like, completely left.

01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:05.930
Kratom seemed to step in and give him just...

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:09.017
<i>For whatever imbalance he had,</i>

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:10.852
<i>that's the key that fits him.</i>

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:13.813
So, from that point on, and he'll be
the first to tell you

01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:15.773
that it's not just kratom,

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:17.859
it's, you know, working on spirituality,

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:21.238
<i>his relationship with God, going
to meetings, giving back,</i>

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:23.781
exercise. Takes kratom twice a day.

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:26.243
He's not high, loopy,

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:28.203
forgetful, inappropriate,

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:30.706
- anything.
- His eyes are clear,

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:33.709
- and we've seen him. We've seen him...
- Yeah.

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.001
Anything but normal.

01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:37.003
[Chris] Do you feel like it's addictive?

01:02:37.045 --> 01:02:39.172
I think it's got addictive
properties, for sure.

01:02:39.214 --> 01:02:41.049
I mean, obviously,

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:42.884
but, and not necessarily

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:45.011
physically, but, you know, psychologically,

01:02:45.053 --> 01:02:47.222
if there's something that's gonna make you
feel better,

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:51.560
you know, I feel like that's addictive.

01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:54.438
[Chris] <i> Now that I'm sober, one
of my favorite things to do</i>

01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:56.147
<i>is to help other people</i>

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:58.275
<i>by sharing my story at meetings.</i>

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:01.319
<i>I was excited to speak at Cliffside, Malibu,</i>

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:03.238
<i>the place where I got sober.</i>

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.115
<i>But then I got a phone call.</i>

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:06.824
So Mindy,

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:08.535
- Who is our mutual friend,
- Yes.

01:03:08.577 --> 01:03:10.120
Just blew you out.

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:11.705
Said, "We love you,

01:03:11.747 --> 01:03:14.082
we don't have a judgment on the kratom,

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:15.584
but you're not speaking at our meeting."

01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:17.252
- That's what happened.
- Yes, sure.

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:18.962
How'd that make you feel?

01:03:19.003 --> 01:03:22.132
I kinda felt hurt... It hurt my feelings,
to tell you the truth.

01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:24.801
Now, I love Mindy, it had
nothing to do with her,

01:03:24.842 --> 01:03:28.305
it's just that I felt like
maybe I wasn't sober anymore.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:29.931
And I don't know, like,

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:32.476
you know, I mean, am I?

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:34.352
Where does that leave you?

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:36.647
Taking something that's not ever been

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:39.983
put in a category, or put in, you know,

01:03:40.024 --> 01:03:42.778
in a box. I just take it because I'm in pain.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.071
Well, I don't know enough about it.

01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:48.784
And I've done some serious study

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:50.868
over the last few days.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:54.539
You know, I've got Connie who is an addiction
research fellow.

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:57.083
And she's given me so much to read

01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:59.586
<i>that when I couldn't read anymore,</i>

01:03:59.628 --> 01:04:03.006
I had somebody sit in my
office and read to me.

01:04:03.881 --> 01:04:05.801
There's no uniformity

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.219
<i>in making the drug.</i>

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:12.056
<i>There's no uniformity in
the dosage of the drug.</i>

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:15.352
And ironically enough,

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:18.480
I'm actually treating a
couple of people right now

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:20.357
at Cliffside

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:23.360
who have been abusing kratom.

01:04:23.819 --> 01:04:25.028
Okay.

01:04:25.654 --> 01:04:27.155
Having said that...

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:32.118
it would be criminal,

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:34.538
bordering on the criminal,

01:04:35.913 --> 01:04:38.750
to not do the research

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:43.880
to figure out what the appropriate
medicinal purposes are.

01:04:43.921 --> 01:04:46.508
People abuse everything.

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:49.135
Well, Chris, you're just defending your right

01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:50.804
to use this substance.

01:04:50.846 --> 01:04:52.930
- Sure.
- Just like any other addict would.

01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:54.932
- So, how do we know?
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:56.852
And the truth is, we don't know.

01:04:56.893 --> 01:05:00.271
Now, I know you, and I believe you.

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:03.441
Okay? You look fine to me.

01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:05.736
I've never seen you look this good.

01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:07.320
Never seen you this calm.

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:09.197
We get about 100 calls a day

01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:12.116
from people trying to get
off drugs and alcohol.

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:14.411
Ninety calls

01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:16.830
are because of prescription opiates.

01:05:16.872 --> 01:05:18.415
Ninety of them.

01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:21.918
Why do you think that nobody's
stopping the opiate epidemic?

01:05:21.959 --> 01:05:23.670
Let's talk about why it's happening.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:28.132
Why it's happening is

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:31.636
there is no advertising necessary

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:34.639
<i>for opiates.</i>

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:36.266
- [Chris] <i> You never see it.
- Never.</i>

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:39.394
<i>If you stop taking opiates, you get sick.</i>

01:05:40.144 --> 01:05:41.479
<i>You don't have a choice.</i>

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:43.940
People think slavery ended in 1865,

01:05:43.981 --> 01:05:47.985
it didn't. It's going on right now in 2017.

01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:50.697
Okay? Slavery exists today.

01:05:50.739 --> 01:05:52.657
<i>Okay? If you're on opiates,</i>

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:54.534
<i>you are a slave.</i>

01:05:54.576 --> 01:05:58.204
<i>You're not controlling that drug, that drug
is controlling you.</i>

01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:01.291
Everything you got. Every goddamn pill.

01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:04.586
[Chris] <i> So, how long does a
shipment this size last?</i>

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:06.003
How long does it take to sell this?

01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:07.798
- About a month. Yeah.
- Really?

01:06:07.839 --> 01:06:10.049
- 2,500 pounds of kratom in a month?
- Kilos.

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:12.093
Kilos of kratom in a month.

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:13.637
[shutter rolls]

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:16.848
So, from here what happens
is, once we open these,

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:19.517
then the next thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna test it.

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:23.313
Whenever we send product out for testing,
like all of this product sitting here,

01:06:23.354 --> 01:06:26.733
none of this can be used yet, because
we don't have test results back yet.

01:06:26.775 --> 01:06:28.067
So every batch, you have to test it?

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:29.945
- [Dunn] Have to, no, but we do.
- Yeah.

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:31.613
<i>We actually test it three times.</i>

01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:33.865
<i>The FDA put out this import alert that says,</i>

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:37.034
we're not allowed to import this because
they don't feel it's safe.

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:39.496
- But they never tested it, so I mean...
- Sure.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:42.206
They're basing their opinion without tests.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:43.750
So many people talk shit about the FDA,

01:06:43.792 --> 01:06:46.127
- but we really need to support the FDA...
- Yes, we do.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.379
...because once everybody gets onboard,

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:52.008
and you know, when the FDA says,
"Okay, this is a full supplement,"

01:06:52.049 --> 01:06:54.594
now, we go back to pharmaceutical co-packers.

01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:57.263
- Yes.
- So, now everything's done in a clinical environment.

01:06:57.305 --> 01:07:00.099
We don't have to build each
individual little segment.

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:03.353
I'm surprised there hasn't been a politician,
and maybe we need to find one,

01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:05.689
that gets behind this.

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:08.775
142 Americans are dying every day

01:07:08.817 --> 01:07:10.735
of drug overdose, every day.

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:15.949
Which means we have a 9/11-scale loss
every three weeks in America.

01:07:15.991 --> 01:07:17.701
<i>So, the first recommendation
we say to the president is,</i>

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:19.577
<i>you must declare national emergency.</i>

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:21.955
This problem, Jake, is not happening,

01:07:21.997 --> 01:07:23.790
it's not starting on our street corners.

01:07:23.832 --> 01:07:26.626
It's starting in our doctors'
offices and hospitals.

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:29.587
[Chris] <i> Another politician trying to fix this</i>
<i>opioid crisis</i>

01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:31.464
<i>is Congressman Mark Pocan.</i>

01:07:31.506 --> 01:07:34.175
<i>But kratom's illegal in
his state of Wisconsin,</i>

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:36.135
<i>and he wants to see that changed.</i>

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:38.179
<i>So, he and his colleague, Matt Salmon,</i>

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:40.348
<i>wrote a bipartisan letter to Congress</i>

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.392
<i>begging them to keep kratom legal.</i>

01:07:42.433 --> 01:07:44.978
<i>And they got 50 other congressmen to sign it,</i>

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.105
<i>which, by today's standards, is huge.</i>

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:50.901
This is one where I think the other people
are way ahead of

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:53.110
elected officials, on issues like this.

01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:54.863
They don't see it as an issue.

01:07:54.905 --> 01:07:56.907
<i>And when kratom came up again,</i>

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:59.826
<i>it's something that's been legal in virtually
every state in the country.</i>

01:07:59.868 --> 01:08:02.037
We haven't had problems with it,

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:04.372
and then, all of a sudden,
to see it go to Schedule I

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:06.457
just raised that red flag,
that we thought we needed

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:09.210
to at least try to find a
way to put brakes on it.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:11.755
And I think the important part is
we did it in a bipartisan way,

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:13.172
'cause, you know, so often

01:08:13.214 --> 01:08:14.841
things are either done from
the Left or the Right.

01:08:14.883 --> 01:08:16.426
Sometimes you just gotta do it

01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:18.761
right from where it needs to be addressed,
from both sides.

01:08:18.803 --> 01:08:22.432
And do you think that banning kratom could
actually hurt people?

01:08:22.473 --> 01:08:25.018
Absolutely. I mean, one... I mean, there are
a number of people

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:26.978
that we talked to since doing that,

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.188
who've shared stories like yours.

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:31.858
That this is something that helps them,

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:33.693
especially people who've
been addicted to opioids.

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:37.863
To take that away would seem wrong,
especially if there's not

01:08:37.906 --> 01:08:40.283
hard evidence as a reason why, and so far,

01:08:40.323 --> 01:08:42.035
I haven't seen any hard evidence

01:08:42.077 --> 01:08:44.412
that makes sense why you could justify

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:45.580
putting it on Schedule I.

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:47.497
In fact, if anything, there's research,

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:51.167
<i>including from universities that are looking
at the positive effects</i>

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:53.004
<i>of something like kratom.</i>

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.881
<i>Part of why we have the opioid problem
we have is that there is</i>

01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:56.883
<i>almost an over-prescription of opioids,</i>

01:08:56.925 --> 01:09:00.176
and then an overreaction, like we often do,
to stopping it.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:03.680
And then if people couldn't get now
what they got addicted to,

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:05.475
they went to the street and got heroin.

01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:08.812
And I recently was visiting a hospital
in my district.

01:09:08.853 --> 01:09:11.272
<i>A doctor came late. He goes,
"I'm sorry, I had my daily</i>

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:13.733
<i>heroin overdose to deal with. I just got done.</i>

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:16.027
I was dealing with someone who came in."

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:20.156
You know, we should be
shooting for every possible

01:09:20.197 --> 01:09:23.701
alternative way to make sure you can
get people off of opioids.

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:26.578
And unfortunately, I don't
think we're doing that,

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:28.247
if we look at things like kratom

01:09:28.288 --> 01:09:31.792
as Schedule I rather than,
potentially, a solution.

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:34.587
[Chris] <i> Another potential solution</i>
<i>for this opioid crisis</i>

01:09:34.629 --> 01:09:36.296
<i>might be ibogaine.</i>

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:38.549
<i>Iboga is a natural plant from Africa,</i>

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:41.928
<i>that can turn 20-year heroin addictions around
in hours.</i>

01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:45.723
<i>The problem is it's a Schedule I drug
in the U.S.</i>

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:49.144
<i>Dr. Deborah Mash is the world's
leading researcher on ibogaine,</i>

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:51.354
<i>and she's fighting to make it legal.</i>

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:53.564
<i>But I wonder what she thinks about kratom.</i>

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:55.692
Well, as you may know,
I've spent my life's work

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:57.944
working on a medication from Africa,

01:09:57.986 --> 01:10:01.156
another natural product called ibogaine.

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:05.409
And ibogaine, which comes from
the region of Gabon in Cameroon,

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:09.039
<i>another one of Mother Nature's alkaloids</i>

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:13.209
<i>we know can be used to
successfully detox people</i>

01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:14.836
<i>off of opiates.</i>

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:17.338
So, my worry is that,

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:21.342
you know, we have people who
are not opiate abusers,

01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:23.887
who have never partied with opiates,

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:27.182
who now get introduced to the euphoria

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:30.393
<i>that kratom or mitragynine has.</i>

01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:35.272
I think there's pretty good evidence
that mitragynine is addictive.

01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:39.819
I think there's no doubt about the science
behind that.

01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:43.865
So, do we want another addicting opiate
on the planet?

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:46.076
Does it need to be studied more?
Sure, it does.

01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:47.451
We need more research.

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:50.955
We need better molecules to treat addiction.

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:53.499
Is there a place for developing mitragynine

01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:55.210
for the treatment of addiction?

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:56.669
I'm not sure.

01:10:56.711 --> 01:11:00.173
There are many different
ways that you can substitute

01:11:00.215 --> 01:11:05.011
an opiate to slide off of a heroin habit,

01:11:05.053 --> 01:11:07.097
and to not suffer from the withdrawals.

01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:08.723
And opiate withdrawals are terrible,

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:11.517
so, we understand why patients

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:14.938
<i>may wanna have access to kratom.</i>

01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:16.856
Okay? But I want it regulated.

01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:19.234
I don't want it being sold,

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:20.944
and maybe I'm getting old,

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:22.946
<i>I don't want it being sold in head shops.</i>

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:25.698
I don't want young people playing with it.

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.533
We don't know enough yet.

01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:30.870
And I understand that, historically,
a lot of people have used kratom.

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:32.538
- [Chris] <i> Yeah.
- I get it.</i>

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.458
But the bottom line that gives me pause
over and over again,

01:11:35.499 --> 01:11:38.586
is that we are faced now in the United States

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:41.965
with a staggering epidemic

01:11:42.006 --> 01:11:44.592
- of opiate abuse and addiction.
- Yeah, huge.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.302
I don't wanna add to that.

01:11:46.343 --> 01:11:48.721
- I don't want more people introduced...
- Yeah.

01:11:48.763 --> 01:11:51.557
- ...to addicting opiates.
- But Pharma is actually putting out stronger opiates.

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:53.184
Pharma is another story.

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:54.435
- Okay?
- That's the problem, right?

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:56.229
Well...

01:11:56.271 --> 01:11:58.898
- [chuckling]
- That's another, you know...

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:00.608
- I can't fight that battle.
- Yeah.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:03.820
[Mash] <i> Do I think Pharma made mistakes?</i>
<i>Oh, yes, I do.</i>

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:06.489
<i>Do I think they're responsible for some of
what we're seeing today?</i>

01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:08.449
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:10.785
<i>But we also know there's more heroin
on the streets than ever before.</i>

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:12.620
<i>- Right?</i>
- [Chris] <i> Yeah.</i>

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:18.501
[Mash] <i> Post 9/11, Afghanistan and
the opium runs poisoned Americans.</i>

01:12:18.542 --> 01:12:20.211
<i>"Just bring those drugs in."</i>

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:25.049
And what we need to do is we need to help
our brothers and sisters.

01:12:25.091 --> 01:12:28.303
We need to look at it with a humanistic eye

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:32.098
to give people the opportunity to
kick the habit the best way we can.

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:33.975
And we've gotta be bold.

01:12:34.017 --> 01:12:38.813
And maybe there's a place for kratom
under medical supervision,

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:40.898
- or in treatment centers...
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:44.694
...but, you know, without the money
to work that up,

01:12:45.569 --> 01:12:47.030
it's not going to happen.

01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:50.325
[Chris] <i> In this country, every
time we have an epidemic,</i>

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:53.786
<i>we Stockton Slap it like the Diaz Brothers.</i>

01:12:53.828 --> 01:12:57.456
<i>We weren't gonna let measles, mumps,
or rubella choke us out.</i>

01:12:57.498 --> 01:13:01.752
<i>Smallpox, an Iron Mike Tyson KO in the first.</i>

01:13:01.794 --> 01:13:06.883
<i>Like the Terminator, we decimated chicken pox
with extreme prejudice.</i>

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:09.468
<i>And when our president got polio,</i>

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:13.264
<i>we went all Ultimate Warrior
and press-slammed it.</i>

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:15.599
<i>In the '80s, they sang "We Are The World,"</i>

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:17.643
<i>and every continent banded together</i>

01:13:17.685 --> 01:13:20.230
<i>and obliterated the AIDS epidemic.</i>

01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:24.234
<i>Why aren't we doing the same
for the opioid epidemic?</i>

01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:28.279
<i>But I called the DEA, the FDA, and the NIDA,</i>

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:30.365
<i>and they all said the same thing,</i>

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.449
<i>"We're not gonna talk to you."</i>

01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:35.411
<i>So, it's time to take
matters into our own hands.</i>

01:13:35.452 --> 01:13:38.206
<i>First, we're gonna need
some money for research.</i>

01:13:38.248 --> 01:13:40.791
[Chris] <i> You know, Dr. McCurdy
was with us in England</i>

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.752
<i>and he came out with all this new research.</i>

01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:45.671
And he's saying, you know, the real thing
that we need is money for research.

01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:47.798
And you've done really well with kratom.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:51.761
I just keep thinking like, "Man, if all
these other companies keep bombing out,

01:13:51.802 --> 01:13:54.847
they're not testing our product, they're
not doing what they're supposed to do,

01:13:54.889 --> 01:13:56.640
like, we can do it."

01:13:56.682 --> 01:13:59.143
[Dunn] The other thing I like that
McCurdy's doing is he's developing

01:13:59.185 --> 01:14:01.687
that quick and easy test for adulterants.

01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:05.024
So if their people are not testing the
product, and the product is dirty,

01:14:05.066 --> 01:14:06.984
he's got it. He's developing
that test for that as well.

01:14:07.026 --> 01:14:10.321
So, when, like, when I did <i>Prescription Thugs,</i>
it was a different thing.

01:14:10.363 --> 01:14:11.781
So I did <i> Prescription Thugs,</i>

01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:13.783
I wanted to help people get off of opioids.

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:19.080
And I think that we achieved warning people
that opioids are dangerous.

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:22.499
But I wasn't able to really
get people off of 'em.

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:24.085
I wasn't able to help the problem.

01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:26.212
And this is a step towards a solution.

01:14:26.254 --> 01:14:28.005
I'd love to get involved, love to help.

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:31.801
We'll fund that first round
of research ourselves.

01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:35.179
[Chris] <i> Kelly agreed to get the ball rolling</i>
<i>on funding research.</i>

01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:37.181
<i>So I got him to hop on a plane with me,</i>

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:40.059
<i>head to Florida, and catch
up with Dr. McCurdy.</i>

01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:43.313
[rock music playing]

01:14:51.321 --> 01:14:54.198
<i>And now, it was time to talk about
making a difference.</i>

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.409
[inaudible]

01:14:56.451 --> 01:14:59.829
[Dunn] Pain, emotional pain
and physical trauma pain,

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:01.914
chemically, are the same inside the body.

01:15:01.956 --> 01:15:04.541
If we know that, how come
we can't measure pain?

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:06.336
Well, pain is a subjective measurement.

01:15:06.377 --> 01:15:09.046
Nobody can objectify pain
measurement right now

01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:10.547
<i>like you're asking, why can't we measure it?</i>

01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:12.342
<i>It's the fifth vital sign now.</i>

01:15:12.383 --> 01:15:16.012
<i>So, when you get checked
into an emergency room,</i>

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:17.638
<i>or you get checked into a hospital,</i>

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.183
<i>they wanna check your blood pressure,
your weight,</i>

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:22.393
<i>you know, your temperature,</i>

01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:25.980
<i>and then they ask you, "So, what's
your pain level on one to ten?"</i>

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:30.234
There's no way to judge that other than
you telling me "a ten."

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:33.029
How can we get involved? How can we help
a lot of people?

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:35.072
And how do we bring <i> this,</i>

01:15:35.114 --> 01:15:39.660
because we believe a lot in this plant and
the possibilities that it can provide.

01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:42.788
We need to know where we stand
on abuse potential.

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:47.502
We need to know where we stand on the
limitations of, you know, how much can we give,

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:49.462
what doses do we need to be giving,

01:15:49.504 --> 01:15:51.255
how do we need to be giving it?

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:53.883
If we can have a standardized material

01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:58.637
that we know meets whatever the guidelines are
for that standardization,

01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:01.349
and doesn't go above or below that,

01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:03.184
so that every time you get that product,

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:06.396
you're getting exactly what you signed up for.

01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:09.023
You know, you can look at
it in the spirits industry,

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:11.526
you can look at it in the tobacco industry.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:16.197
If we eliminated all opioids from
the face of the earth tomorrow,

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:18.032
they'll find something else.

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:20.493
- Street chemists will make a new one. [laughs]
- To go after it, right?

01:16:20.535 --> 01:16:23.287
So, I don't think it's gonna
be the end-all, be-all,

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:25.789
but I certainly think it's gonna be a solution

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:32.838
that will help people that are really
interested in getting off of opioids.

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.716
Why I became a pharmacist was because I wanted
to help people.

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:39.053
Why I ended up becoming a researcher

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:42.932
was because, along the way, I fell in love
with the fact that we can make discoveries

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:44.600
that would impact far more people

01:16:44.641 --> 01:16:47.978
than if I was just at your corner drug store.

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:52.900
If we make a really important discovery,
or we're able to be a part of

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:57.530
a big process that can affect, you know,

01:16:57.572 --> 01:16:59.282
not just people on the corner,

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:02.910
- but people on every corner, right?
- Yes.

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:06.122
Not just in this country,
but across the continent,

01:17:06.163 --> 01:17:08.249
across the globe.

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:11.544
I would love to see in my lifetime,

01:17:11.586 --> 01:17:16.299
that we were able to contribute
in a huge, positive way

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:20.970
to opioid addiction, drug addiction,
in a bigger picture,

01:17:21.011 --> 01:17:24.056
because I really think this is beyond
just opioid addiction.

01:17:24.098 --> 01:17:26.809
We felt strongly enough about
it to file the patents,

01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:32.356
originally, on treating essentially every drug
of abuse.

01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:33.941
So, we got the team together.

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:36.360
- [laughs]
- Team's here. We can do it. We can do the work.

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:37.820
[Chris] <i> This is exciting,</i>

01:17:37.861 --> 01:17:39.989
<i>and the reason I make documentaries.</i>

01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:42.908
<i>Dr. McCurdy has agreed to move forward
with his research</i>

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:45.869
<i>to the point of the first human
clinical trials with kratom.</i>

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:48.623
<i>And that can only happen if
we're all on the same page.</i>

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:52.627
The DEA is soliciting public comment
about kratom through December 1st.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:56.589
After that, it will decide whether it
will proceed with any kind of regulation,

01:17:56.631 --> 01:17:58.215
permanent or temporary.

01:17:58.257 --> 01:18:00.134
[Chris] <i> Kratom advocates went to work</i>

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:03.179
<i>and sent over 5,000 comments to the DEA.</i>

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.097
<i>But as the deadline got closer,</i>

01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:06.516
<i>I started getting nervous.</i>

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:07.933
<i>What if it wasn't enough?</i>

01:18:07.975 --> 01:18:09.935
<i>What if they did really ban this plant</i>

01:18:09.977 --> 01:18:12.062
<i>and make it a Schedule-I drug?</i>

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:15.483
<i>Then I got an idea, and I sent the text.</i>

01:18:15.525 --> 01:18:19.195
It has these properties that
help people bridge the gap

01:18:19.236 --> 01:18:20.946
when they get off of opioids,

01:18:20.988 --> 01:18:22.532
so they don't have withdrawals.

01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:25.909
It seems like this is a drug, or a plant,
I should say,

01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:29.664
that just does not have enough... There's not
enough data.

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:31.290
- There's not enough research.
- Not enough research.

01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:34.126
The vet I was talking about,
he can't live without kratom.

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:36.003
<i>What are we gonna do, take it away from him?</i>

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:38.381
- [Rogan] <i> Yeah.</i>
<i>- Like, where is he gonna go? Back on opioids?</i>

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:40.675
<i>- To the VA hospital? Like, it's...</i>
- [Rogan exhales sharply]

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:42.426
[Rogan] Fuck.

01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:45.596
What a weird situation. So,
we really need you, Chris.

01:18:45.638 --> 01:18:48.724
- [both chuckle]
- This documentary is actually important.

01:18:48.765 --> 01:18:50.726
The one way we can keep this legal

01:18:50.767 --> 01:18:52.687
and keep other things legal as well,

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:55.690
is everybody needs to go to a
website that the DEA has set up.

01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:58.192
It's called kratomcomments.org

01:18:58.234 --> 01:18:59.985
<i>And if you make a comment by December 1st,</i>

01:19:00.027 --> 01:19:02.238
<i>the DEA has to read it.</i>

01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:03.947
And your show is so powerful,

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:07.702
if we can get 10,000 comments,
then this is gonna stay legal.

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.704
New At Noon, a massive public outcry

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.330
has the Feds doing an about-face

01:19:11.372 --> 01:19:14.750
on a controversial herbal supplement
known as kratom.

01:19:14.791 --> 01:19:17.086
<i>The agency was flooded with
thousands of angry calls.</i>

01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:19.547
DEA has backed off.

01:19:19.589 --> 01:19:23.217
[man] <i> After 23,000 public comments</i>
<i>submitted to the DEA...</i>

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:30.558
99.1% of the comments said, "Fuck off.
This is good."

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:33.394
[Chris] <i> And for now, kratom was saved.</i>

01:19:33.436 --> 01:19:36.188
<i>A spokesperson for the
DEA told me on the phone</i>

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:39.233
<i>that the response was overwhelming.</i>

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:43.237
<i>They had never seen such a positive outpouring
from consumers.</i>

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:45.406
<i>There were a few comments against kratom,</i>

01:19:45.448 --> 01:19:49.076
<i>one in particular from Dr. Daniel Fabricant,</i>

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:51.579
<i>who also blocked me on Twitter.</i>

01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:53.414
So, there was a drug called flakka.

01:19:53.456 --> 01:19:55.124
- Have you heard of flakka?
- [Rogan] No.

01:19:55.165 --> 01:19:58.544
[reporter] <i>Your body temperature</i>
<i>rising to 105, 108 degrees.</i>

01:19:58.586 --> 01:20:03.006
<i>That's why this person had his family
dump water on him.</i>

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:05.676
- [Rogan] <i> Whoa.</i>
- [Chris] <i> So, I think kratom gets lumped in</i>

01:20:05.718 --> 01:20:09.388
<i>with these synthetic drugs like
Spice and flakka, that are...</i>

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:11.348
<i>Watch, this guy jumps
into the back of the car.</i>

01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:15.060
What the fuck? This is someone on flakka?
Holy shit.

01:20:15.102 --> 01:20:16.771
[reporter] <i> We see in here, paranoia...</i>

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:20.190
- [yelling indistinctly]
- [man] <i> Relax. Relax.</i>

01:20:20.775 --> 01:20:22.109
[screaming]

01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:24.111
[Rogan] <i> Oh, my God.</i>

01:20:24.153 --> 01:20:27.573
I think it was a drug that they were
selling in head shops down in Florida,

01:20:27.615 --> 01:20:30.618
and it got banned within, like,
I don't know, couple of months

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:33.829
- Of it being...
- Always fucking Florida.

01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:35.831
- It's always Florida.
- Goddamn, Florida.

01:20:35.872 --> 01:20:38.250
The gateway to demonic possession.

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:41.462
[Chris] <i> If there were ever an
epicenter of addiction in America,</i>

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:43.339
<i>it'd be Broward County.</i>

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:45.174
<i>At the peak of the pill mill days,</i>

01:20:45.215 --> 01:20:47.426
<i>there were 89 of them there.</i>

01:20:47.468 --> 01:20:50.346
<i>Last year, 159 people died there,</i>

01:20:50.387 --> 01:20:53.516
<i>and plenty of people are more than happy
to get you sober</i>

01:20:53.557 --> 01:20:55.267
<i>for a price.</i>

01:20:55.309 --> 01:20:58.771
<i>This dude charged insurance companies
$58 million</i>

01:20:58.813 --> 01:21:02.065
<i>for drug tests that were
completely unnecessary.</i>

01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:04.819
<i>All in Florida, all the time.</i>

01:21:04.901 --> 01:21:07.571
Ian Mautner was on three antidepressants,

01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:10.449
that were... They all had a
black box of warning on them.

01:21:10.491 --> 01:21:12.117
<i>"This may cause suicidal thoughts</i>

01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:14.328
<i>in young people and adolescents."</i>

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:16.038
And, you know, that's something that's like,

01:21:16.079 --> 01:21:18.165
now you get to say, "Well,
he died from kratom."

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.959
You know, I don't think that's fair.

01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:23.420
Well, I'm not gonna discuss that one case.

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:26.215
I know what the state's leading epidemiologist
will tell you.

01:21:26.256 --> 01:21:28.217
- I believe you guys are gonna interview him?
- Sure.

01:21:28.258 --> 01:21:32.137
I know what Dr. Mash, who studied it down
in the University of Miami

01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:34.014
will tell you, and what her white paper says.

01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:35.516
Let's regulate it.

01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:38.935
If there's a benefit to it,
let NIDA work through this.

01:21:38.977 --> 01:21:40.937
There are companies, there's three companies
out there

01:21:40.979 --> 01:21:43.607
that actually do it legally,
like as a supplement,

01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:46.527
and they don't label it as
"Not for human consumption."

01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:48.445
Most of the companies do.

01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:50.322
And I think that that's a bad thing. I think
they need to get rid of that.

01:21:50.364 --> 01:21:52.408
- They need to...
- And how would you propose they get rid of that?

01:21:52.449 --> 01:21:55.411
Do GMP, just run it exactly like
the supplement companies run it.

01:21:55.452 --> 01:21:58.080
They test everything when it comes in,
and they test it before it goes out,

01:21:58.121 --> 01:22:01.751
and they know that what it says on the label
is exactly what's in it.

01:22:01.792 --> 01:22:03.419
- I think they definitely...
- Well, I wish you luck.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.295
- Thank you.
- I know

01:22:05.337 --> 01:22:08.090
that it's a hard thing to have an addiction
and to have to get over it.

01:22:08.131 --> 01:22:09.717
- Yeah.
- And I understand

01:22:09.759 --> 01:22:12.469
the fear of anybody that
wants to take it away.

01:22:12.511 --> 01:22:14.137
You've seen that throughout the country.

01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:17.641
The voices that are addicted to one drug
swing over,

01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:20.895
and, in my opinion, are addicted to kratom and
don't want it to go away.

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:22.688
It was never a problem before.

01:22:22.730 --> 01:22:25.274
It's banned in its country
of origin for over 42 years.

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:26.567
Do you know why?

01:22:26.609 --> 01:22:28.527
Because it was cutting into the heroin trade.

01:22:28.569 --> 01:22:31.280
[scoffs] They weren't making enough money
off of their drugs,

01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:35.033
- So they had to cut down kratom.
- Oh, that's such a freakin' ridiculous soundbite.

01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:38.454
[Chris] <i> Kristin Jacobs couldn't seem to get</i>
<i>any of her bills passed</i>

01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:40.664
<i>or garner any support.</i>

01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:42.332
It's getting completely slandered,

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:45.001
people are putting it with
bath salts and spice,

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:47.254
which is crazy.

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:49.840
Everything in this package
upon this ordinance,

01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:51.007
it's all negative.

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:52.843
It's not balanced, it's not broad,

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:55.387
it's inexcusable.

01:22:55.429 --> 01:22:57.264
There are people that are hurting out there,

01:22:57.306 --> 01:23:00.016
and you wanna ban this stuff
and put them in jail.

01:23:00.058 --> 01:23:02.645
I know, Commissioner Jacobs,
this is your last meeting.

01:23:02.686 --> 01:23:05.314
And I would like nothing more
than to vote for something

01:23:05.355 --> 01:23:07.316
that you brought in your last meeting,

01:23:07.357 --> 01:23:09.067
but I'm not yet ready to vote on this.

01:23:09.109 --> 01:23:11.654
You are dealing with those who are addicted,

01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:14.448
and you're sitting there, listening to
all those maybe addicts in the room

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:15.783
saying that they're not addicted,

01:23:15.825 --> 01:23:17.576
and you're hearing others up here,

01:23:17.618 --> 01:23:19.077
out of a lack of knowledge,

01:23:19.119 --> 01:23:21.580
and indeed, even our own medical examiner,

01:23:21.622 --> 01:23:24.333
who doesn't exactly deal with live people...

01:23:24.374 --> 01:23:26.585
[Chris] <i> I guess it's not
the voice of addiction,</i>

01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:28.253
<i>it's just the voice of reason.</i>

01:23:28.295 --> 01:23:31.298
<i>And it came down pretty
hard on Kristin Jacobs.</i>

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:33.091
<i>All of her bills got shot down,</i>

01:23:33.133 --> 01:23:35.678
<i>but she still keeps trying.</i>

01:23:35.719 --> 01:23:38.973
<i>After the hearing, the Florida State
Law Enforcement Bureau</i>

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:41.224
<i>conducted their own investigation</i>

01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:43.268
<i>and came out with this statement.</i>

01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:45.646
<i>"A review of the information
currently available</i>

01:23:45.688 --> 01:23:49.441
<i>through identified law enforcement
and laboratory sources in Florida</i>

01:23:49.483 --> 01:23:53.779
<i>indicates that kratom does not
constitute a significant risk</i>

01:23:53.821 --> 01:23:57.491
<i>to the safety and welfare
of Florida residents."</i>

01:23:57.533 --> 01:23:59.368
<i>In the case of Ian Mautner,</i>

<i>Florida State Law Enforcement</i>

01:24:01.119 --> 01:24:03.413
<i>said the presence of other

<i>may have contributed to the
subject's state of mind</i>

<i>at the time of the suicide.</i>

01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:11.171
<i>I wanna live in a world that is pain-free,</i>

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:13.674
<i>addiction-free, and judgment-free.</i>

01:24:13.716 --> 01:24:16.343
<i>I wanna reverse this pain epidemic.</i>

01:24:16.385 --> 01:24:18.762
<i>Being out of pain is a basic human right.</i>

01:24:18.804 --> 01:24:20.639
<i>So, if someone is stuck in pain,</i>

01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:22.182
<i>or stuck in addiction,</i>

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:23.893
<i>we need to have the compassion</i>

01:24:23.934 --> 01:24:26.896
<i>to reach out and pull them out of it.</i>

01:24:26.937 --> 01:24:30.065
<i>I'll do everything I can to help further
the research on kratom</i>

01:24:30.106 --> 01:24:32.401
<i>and other effective non-addictive painkillers.</i>

01:24:32.442 --> 01:24:34.361
<i>But I do think it's kind of ironic</i>

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:36.112
<i>that we have to do all these studies</i>

01:24:36.154 --> 01:24:39.324
<i>for something that's been used safely
for hundreds of years.</i>

01:24:39.366 --> 01:24:40.743
<i>In the past decade,</i>

01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:44.413
<i>under the watchful eyes
of the FDA and the DEA,</i>

01:24:44.454 --> 01:24:47.917
<i>with all their hundreds of clinical
trials, studies, and warnings,</i>

01:24:47.958 --> 01:24:50.711
<i>and all the programs to keep kids off drugs,</i>

01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:54.715
<i>over 200,000 Americans have
died from opioid painkillers,</i>

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:57.885
<i>a lot of people I really loved.</i>

01:24:57.927 --> 01:24:59.762
<i>So much for your war on drugs.</i>

01:24:59.803 --> 01:25:02.389
<i>The opioid crisis is an emergency,</i>

01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:05.851
<i>and I'm saying officially,
right now, it is an emergency.</i>

01:25:05.893 --> 01:25:07.895
<i>It's a national emergency.</i>

01:25:07.937 --> 01:25:10.105
<i>We're going to spend a lot
of time, a lot of effort,</i>

01:25:10.146 --> 01:25:14.109
<i>and a lot of money on the opioid crisis.</i>

01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:17.279
[Chris] <i> Kratom may not be the only hope</i>
<i>for this opioid crisis,</i>

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.114
<i>but it's certainly one of them.</i>

01:25:19.155 --> 01:25:22.492
<i>So before we turn our backs on
something that God gave us,</i>

01:25:22.534 --> 01:25:25.621
<i>maybe we all just need
to take a leaf of faith.</i>

01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:48.936
[man] Um, ask, "So, when you did the studies,
were there any side effects with the rats?"

01:25:48.978 --> 01:25:51.647
So, when you did the side effects, were there
any studies with...

01:25:51.688 --> 01:25:53.023
- Were there...
- [men laughing]

01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:54.441
- [man] This is...
- Side effects.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:56.110
- [man] This is gonna make the blooper reel.
- Yeah.

01:25:56.192 --> 01:25:57.945
[all laugh]

01:25:57.987 --> 01:26:00.948
So, right over here, this house,
this is the guy I was talking about.

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:02.866
With the gay feet.

01:26:02.908 --> 01:26:05.077
[man] Ah, was it really bad?

01:26:05.119 --> 01:26:06.662
[Chris] I'm just kidding. I'm trying to point
shit out, so it looks like we're talking.

01:26:07.704 --> 01:26:09.164
[Chris] Oh, if you die at my house...

01:26:09.205 --> 01:26:12.626
Um, you signed a waiver, right?
[laughing]

01:26:12.668 --> 01:26:14.419
- I haven't signed a waiver yet.
- [Chris] Ah, shit.

01:26:15.129 --> 01:26:16.463
[groaning]

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:17.714
[Chris] You should talk about smoking, buddy.

01:26:17.756 --> 01:26:19.215
I still smoke. I still have bad habits.

01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:20.717
No, no, no. I don't wanna
talk about that.

01:26:20.759 --> 01:26:22.761
- No?
- No.

01:26:22.803 --> 01:26:24.096
[whispers] My mother thinks I quit.

01:26:24.138 --> 01:26:25.722
Oh, your mother thinks...

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:27.307
- [woman] Let's see the dance moves.
- [man] Yeah, yeah.

01:26:27.349 --> 01:26:29.559
No, no. I'm shy.

01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:30.602
Okay.

01:26:30.644 --> 01:26:31.687
[whoops]
