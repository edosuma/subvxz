WEBVTT

00:02.236 --> 00:06.140
( slow, dramatic hip-hop intro
fades in )

00:06.207 --> 00:08.942
* You ready? *

00:09.009 --> 00:11.145
* Let's go! *

00:14.115 --> 00:16.117
* Yeah *

00:16.184 --> 00:19.187
* For those of you that want
to know what we're all about *

00:19.253 --> 00:20.888
* It's like this, y'all,
come on *

00:20.954 --> 00:23.391
* This is ten percent luck,
20 percent skill *

00:23.457 --> 00:27.428
* 15 percent concentrated
power of will *

00:27.495 --> 00:30.298
* Five percent pleasure,
50 percent pain *

00:30.364 --> 00:32.800
* And 100 percent reason
to remember the name *

00:32.866 --> 00:35.336
* He doesn't need
his name up in lights *

00:35.403 --> 00:38.972
* He just wants to be heard... *

00:39.039 --> 00:43.077
( thunder rumbling )

00:43.144 --> 00:45.179
Hey, my phone...

00:45.246 --> 00:47.081
* It's not about the salary,
it's all about reality *

00:47.148 --> 00:49.250
* And making some noise... *

00:52.920 --> 00:54.722
( gunshots )

00:54.788 --> 00:57.691
( tires squealing )

01:02.396 --> 01:05.799
( sports broadcast
playing on TV )

01:05.866 --> 01:07.368
Donny, when did you get here?

01:07.435 --> 01:09.970
Just now. Thought I'd watch
to the end of the game.

01:10.037 --> 01:11.372
Where you going?

01:11.439 --> 01:13.807
He's going on a date.

01:13.874 --> 01:14.942
DON:
Oh, yeah?

01:15.008 --> 01:15.809
Yeah.
You know that girl

01:15.876 --> 01:17.945
-Donna, from Val's wedding?
-Yeah.

01:18.011 --> 01:19.180
You know, the, uh, caterer?

01:19.247 --> 01:20.381
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, her.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.483
Oh, hey, listen, I wanted
to ask you guys something.

01:22.550 --> 01:26.086
Uh, it's her birthday coming up,
and I wanted to get her a gift.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.188
You know, something...

01:27.255 --> 01:30.524
( stammering ): I don't know,
I just... don't know what.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.394
It's just a question
of what you want to say.

01:33.461 --> 01:34.495
Well, how about,
"Happy Birthday?"

01:34.562 --> 01:36.764
You know, two mathematicians
from University College

01:36.830 --> 01:38.399
in London actually
recently addressed

01:38.466 --> 01:40.000
this very same question.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.269
Mathematicians?

01:41.335 --> 01:42.903
English mathematicians?

01:42.970 --> 01:45.139
They used game theory to analyze
the best characteristics

01:45.206 --> 01:46.407
of a courtship gift.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.908
Yeah. Well, no offense, Charlie.

01:47.975 --> 01:50.043
It sounds to me like two
math geeks who don't date much.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.445
I do take offense.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.946
Yeah, all right, shut up.
So, keep going.

01:53.013 --> 01:56.617
Well, assuming that the goal is
the female's receptiveness...

01:59.052 --> 02:00.321
Yes.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.889
They found
that an extravagant gift,

02:01.955 --> 02:03.291
one that's costly to the man,

02:03.357 --> 02:05.259
but of no real financial value
to the woman,

02:05.326 --> 02:07.261
offers the best chance
of success.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.430
So, why don't you buy her
some flowers?

02:09.497 --> 02:11.932
You know what? Take her
to dinner in a fancy restaurant.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.667
Okay, that's doable.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.569
See? You guys still doubt
the power of math?

02:15.636 --> 02:18.239
Yeah, well, when it comes to
female receptiveness, yes.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.573
( phone ringing )

02:19.640 --> 02:20.708
Huh.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.176
Eppes.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.278
Right. On my way.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.413
What is that?

02:25.479 --> 02:26.780
Shooting. Got to go.

02:26.847 --> 02:27.981
Hey, have fun with, uh...

02:28.048 --> 02:29.149
ALAN:
Donna.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.484
Right.

02:31.919 --> 02:35.789
( siren blaring,
indistinct radio transmission )

02:35.856 --> 02:37.891
( helicopter hovering )

02:41.895 --> 02:42.996
Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.

02:43.063 --> 02:44.432
DON:
Hey, what's going on?

02:44.498 --> 02:45.933
Looks like a drive-by.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.236
What, are you kidding me?
Why'd they bring us in?

02:48.302 --> 02:49.470
Just got down here myself.

02:49.537 --> 02:50.671
Cops on the scene say

02:50.738 --> 02:52.105
they were told
to sit tight and wait.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.374
-For what?
-For me.

02:53.441 --> 02:56.777
Lieutenant Gary Walker,
LAPD, Gang Impact Team.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.012
Hey. Don Eppes, FBI...

02:59.079 --> 03:01.215
No badges. U.S. Attorney
doesn't want the locals

03:01.282 --> 03:03.150
to know FBI is on the scene.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.585
Oh, yeah? And why is that?

03:04.652 --> 03:06.854
Well, apparently, they don't
want anyone to blow his cover.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.589
Though personally, I think
it's a little late.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.824
But I'm not calling the shots.

03:16.997 --> 03:17.965
( sighs )

03:20.167 --> 03:22.202
His name is Anton Rhimes.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.104
Worked an extortion case

03:24.171 --> 03:25.373
together down in Long Beach.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.708
Don, he's FBI.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.452
We all use math every day,

03:38.519 --> 03:40.254
to predict weather,

03:40.321 --> 03:43.123
to tell time,

03:43.190 --> 03:45.926
to handle money.

03:45.993 --> 03:49.963
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

03:50.030 --> 03:53.401
It's logic...

03:53.467 --> 03:56.236
it's rationality.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.771
It's using your mind

03:57.838 --> 03:59.973
to solve the biggest mysteries
that we know.

04:07.047 --> 04:10.551
WALKER: Agent Rhimes was part
of a multi-agency task force.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.853
He'd been working undercover
for ten months.

04:12.920 --> 04:13.854
As a gang member?

04:13.921 --> 04:16.089
Yeah. He'd infiltrated
the 23rd Street Syndicate,

04:16.156 --> 04:18.592
and was providing information
regarding their leadership.

04:18.659 --> 04:19.960
So, they took him out?

04:20.027 --> 04:21.161
That'd be my guess.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.330
You find any casings?

04:22.396 --> 04:23.764
No, but that's not unusual.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.866
They tend to stay
in the car in a drive-by.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.468
All right, I'm gonna talk
to the U.S. Attorney.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.069
Meanwhile, you guys should
just keep taking care

04:29.136 --> 04:30.237
of the evidence, all right?

04:30.304 --> 04:31.372
Yeah.

04:31.439 --> 04:32.640
Restaurant was pretty busy
all day.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.007
You couldn't pull
a single witness?

04:34.074 --> 04:36.544
Well, it's kind of the way it is
with these people, Agent.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.279
It's kind of us versus them
out there.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.950
I meant lawmen versus civilians.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.085
Right.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.554
I know what we're waiting on.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.522
An undercover FBI
agent gets whacked.

04:48.589 --> 04:49.723
We all know what happened.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.893
23rd Street bangers found out
his identity and had him killed.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.995
In my opinion, we ought
to hit them back hard for it.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.164
The longer a thing like this
goes unanswered,

04:57.230 --> 04:58.366
the more dangerous it gets

04:58.432 --> 04:59.533
for all of us out there.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.001
I appreciate your sense
of outrage,

05:01.068 --> 05:03.504
Lieutenant, but we need to
confirm that Agent Rhimes' cover

05:03.571 --> 05:05.238
really was blown
before we make a move.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.474
You guys, this is Robin Brooks.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.608
She's the Assistant
U.S. Attorney

05:07.675 --> 05:10.077
running the task force
that Rhimes was on.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.779
What I was suggesting was
that we grab as many

05:11.845 --> 05:14.515
of these 23rd Street bangers
as we can for questioning.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.649
Which would be as good
as telling them

05:15.716 --> 05:16.984
that Rhimes was a federal agent.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.085
COLBY:
Look, Counselor,

05:18.151 --> 05:19.086
let's not forget.

05:19.152 --> 05:19.887
We have a man down.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.054
Where I come from,
that means something.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.990
Look, the 23rd Street Syndicate
is responsible

05:23.056 --> 05:24.392
for dozens of homicides,

05:24.458 --> 05:26.226
extortion, drug trafficking.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.396
I'm sorry, but I am not about
to blow a 14-month investigation

05:28.462 --> 05:29.530
to make you feel better.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.664
DON:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:30.731 --> 05:31.799
Let's just take
a breath here, okay?

05:31.865 --> 05:34.267
I mean, an agent did give
his life for this case.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.335
But I agree.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.804
There's no point jeopardizing
what he was working on

05:36.870 --> 05:39.006
until we absolutely have to,
right?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.809
Let me see what you got.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.045
Like a lot of gangs,
23rd Street's branching out.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.448
They've set up shop
in over nine states.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.682
We've had to turn

05:48.749 --> 05:50.418
to federal racketeering
provisions to stop them.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.719
So you're building
a RICO case?

05:51.785 --> 05:53.754
Same way we've gone after
traditional organized crime.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.122
Take down the leadership.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.459
It was Agent Rhimes' job
to identify the "shot callers"

05:58.526 --> 06:00.461
within the 23rd Street
Syndicate.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.263
This is a map

06:03.330 --> 06:05.433
of local gang territories.

06:05.499 --> 06:08.736
None of the boundaries
are exact, as they vary

06:08.802 --> 06:09.970
as bordering gangs battle.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.905
They're random
and unpredictable.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.543
Actually,
they're-they're neither.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.778
Economists have several
math models that we can apply

06:17.845 --> 06:20.313
to analyze how gangs
partition territory.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.949
Now, one of them
was actually

06:22.015 --> 06:25.318
originally designed
to predict plant growth.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.320
In situations
of dense population,

06:27.387 --> 06:29.289
plants struggle
against each other.

06:29.356 --> 06:33.260
They fight to obtain sunlight,
to establish dominance...

06:33.326 --> 06:36.029
And it turns out,
that the same equations designed

06:36.096 --> 06:39.199
to predict plant growth
apply themselves remarkably well

06:39.266 --> 06:41.201
to borders between rival human

06:41.268 --> 06:43.103
populations, as well.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.438
Wh-Wh-What are these flags?

06:44.505 --> 06:46.774
These are gang-related
shootings.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.909
Now, over what time frame?
How many years?

06:48.976 --> 06:50.077
-Years?
-Mm-hmm.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.344
This is just six months.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.714
Six... Six months?

06:53.781 --> 06:55.716
There's almost...
There's almost 100 shootings.

06:55.783 --> 06:56.884
BROOKS:
And those are only

06:56.950 --> 06:58.652
the shootings that are related
to the 23rd Street Syndicate.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.020
WALKER:
You want total

07:00.087 --> 07:02.222
gang shootings,
we're talking more like 1,000.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.957
I'm sorry. In six months?

07:04.024 --> 07:05.025
Yeah.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.259
Wow.
Well, I'm assuming the LAPD

07:06.326 --> 07:07.795
hasn't analyzed this
with a regression tree

07:07.861 --> 07:10.731
or run it through
a Poisson Clumping analysis.

07:10.798 --> 07:11.765
Well, considering
that I have no idea

07:11.832 --> 07:12.900
what that means,
I'm gonna say no.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.802
DON:
He's a mathematician.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.604
You know,
they have their own language.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.472
Charlie, what, do you
see something here?

07:18.539 --> 07:19.640
There is a lot
of information here,

07:19.707 --> 07:20.974
and I'm already detecting
a pattern.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.410
Now, if I could just get
all files on the shootings,

07:23.477 --> 07:24.645
I might be able to tell you

07:24.712 --> 07:26.880
if Agent Rhimes' murder
was part of a pattern,

07:26.947 --> 07:27.915
or an anomaly.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.517
Don, we have
the video surveillance

07:29.583 --> 07:30.651
from the restaurant.

07:30.718 --> 07:33.120
DON:
All right.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.958
DON: All right, so that's Rhimes
on the right,

07:38.025 --> 07:39.059
but who's that?

07:40.460 --> 07:41.529
( remote beeping )

07:41.595 --> 07:42.963
( electronic whirring )

07:43.030 --> 07:44.064
BROOKS:
That's Travis Watts.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.399
He's high up
in the 23rd Street structure.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.801
He's a suspected shot caller.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.169
COLBY:
Well, it looks to me like

07:49.236 --> 07:50.871
he took Rhimes out
for a last supper,

07:50.938 --> 07:52.673
set him up for execution.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.841
I... I don't know.

07:53.907 --> 07:54.675
What about a warrant sweep?

07:54.742 --> 07:56.176
I mean, you do
it all the time.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.244
We could play it low-profile,
you know?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.946
DAVID: So, we run down
23rd Street members

07:59.012 --> 08:01.048
on open warrants,
use that leverage to find Watts.

08:01.114 --> 08:04.552
That way, no one knows
about Agent Rhimes' cover.

08:05.452 --> 08:07.287
Okay.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.822
( hip-hop music playing )

08:35.382 --> 08:37.951
( music fading out )

08:44.157 --> 08:46.093
( sighs )

08:56.503 --> 08:57.571
( sneezes )

08:57.638 --> 08:58.972
Oh, this garage.

08:59.039 --> 09:02.475
Do you have any idea
how many deadly forms of mold

09:02.542 --> 09:03.744
live out here?

09:03.811 --> 09:05.345
Do you have any idea
how many gang-related shootings

09:05.412 --> 09:08.048
there were in Los Angeles
in the past four years?

09:08.115 --> 09:09.750
Obviously, I don't have
that exact figure,

09:09.817 --> 09:11.184
but something tells me you do.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.152
Well, take a guess.

09:12.219 --> 09:15.488
Just go ahead-- all shootings,
non-fatal and fatal.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.591
Go ahead, take a guess.
How many?

09:17.658 --> 09:19.727
Okay. Over the last four years?

09:19.793 --> 09:21.629
I don't know.
Let's say a thousand.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.330
Almost 8,000.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.497
Really?

09:24.564 --> 09:25.733
Yeah.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.300
2,000 of those resulted
in deaths,

09:27.367 --> 09:30.003
and most of them occurred ten
or 12 miles from here.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.505
Gee, those numbers
are overwhelming.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.874
They are.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.308
There's a lot of data here,
Larry,

09:35.375 --> 09:36.977
but the police know
who the players are.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.746
And if I can just find
the key attributes

09:38.812 --> 09:40.180
to connect one crime to another,

09:40.247 --> 09:42.549
I can write an algorithm
to connect the shootings

09:42.616 --> 09:43.583
to the gang members involved.

09:43.651 --> 09:47.487
But Charlie, these issues--
they're just so complicated.

09:47.554 --> 09:48.989
And you know, I mean,

09:49.056 --> 09:51.291
what you're describing--
that seems like a lot to ask,

09:51.358 --> 09:52.325
even for Don.

09:52.392 --> 09:56.029
Well, Don did only ask for help
with this one case, but, uh,

09:56.096 --> 09:58.331
don't all these other victims
deserve justice?

09:59.466 --> 10:04.204
( hip-hop playing )

10:13.346 --> 10:14.547
Whoo!

10:14.614 --> 10:16.083
Guys.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.251
Game over.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.355
Take it back, man.
We'll let you get winners.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.224
Nah, that ain't gonna
work, bro. We got now.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.560
I need you all
to get down on the ground. Yo!

10:27.627 --> 10:29.262
Hit the ground.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.163
WALKER:
Come on.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.899
You know the drill.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.440
I got him! Hey!

10:40.507 --> 10:42.275
Get back here!

10:42.342 --> 10:44.444
Hey! Stop...!

10:44.511 --> 10:46.980
Hey, you, stop, you.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.082
Stop right there.
Stop... Hands up.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.583
Turn around.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.720
Hands up. Hands on your head.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.856
What the hell's going on?

10:55.923 --> 10:57.257
I said, what the hell's
going on?

10:57.324 --> 10:59.026
Ma'am, I've got everything
under control, okay?

10:59.092 --> 11:01.695
You've got what under control?

11:01.762 --> 11:03.363
DAVID:
Ma'am, everything is fine.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.465
I'm just doing my job.

11:05.532 --> 11:06.466
Do you have a warrant?

11:06.533 --> 11:07.901
Excuse me?

11:07.968 --> 11:09.202
I'm the director
of this community center,

11:09.269 --> 11:10.437
and I'm responsible
for what happens

11:10.503 --> 11:12.139
-in this building.
-No, I don't have a warrant,

11:12.205 --> 11:14.374
and I don't need one
to pursue a suspect.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.710
John, take the kids back

11:16.777 --> 11:17.878
in the room.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.279
Come on, guys, let's go.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.481
This doesn't have anything
to do with us. Come on.

11:21.548 --> 11:22.883
Are you all right?

11:22.950 --> 11:24.017
Uh, he ran after me.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.552
I ain't do nothing.

11:25.618 --> 11:27.287
He was told to stop, and he ran.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.689
Well, maybe the gun
had something to do with it.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.658
Kids come here to get away
from violence.

11:31.725 --> 11:32.760
You need some help?

11:32.826 --> 11:35.295
Everything's under
control, Lieutenant.

11:37.364 --> 11:41.101
Ma'am, I have a job to do,
and you need to let me do it.

11:44.972 --> 11:47.040
DAVID:
Everything's fine.

11:48.641 --> 11:53.246
You see what I'm talking about,
about the lack of cooperation.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.117
So, guess what.

11:57.184 --> 12:00.120
Anthony here has got not one,
but two outstanding warrants.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.922
Isn't that right, Anthony?

12:01.989 --> 12:03.824
If you say so, man.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.392
Yeah, man, I say so.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.961
Only good news is, today
we might give you a chance

12:08.028 --> 12:09.429
to change your luck.

12:09.496 --> 12:10.497
How is that?

12:10.563 --> 12:12.199
We're looking
for a friend of yours;

12:12.265 --> 12:15.402
somebody you might roll with:
Travis Watts.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.906
Anthony, you help us,

12:18.972 --> 12:21.942
maybe we worry about
these warrants another day.

12:22.009 --> 12:25.245
COLBY:
What's it gonna be,

12:25.312 --> 12:27.014
Anthony?

12:36.323 --> 12:37.724
MEGAN ( on speaker ):
Where were you

12:37.791 --> 12:38.926
the night before last, Travis?

12:38.992 --> 12:40.794
TRAVIS:
I don't know. A lot of places.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.830
I get around.
You know how it is.

12:42.896 --> 12:46.834
DAVID: This is you
and Anton Rhimes at 6:20.

12:46.900 --> 12:51.438
Only at 6:45, Anton's dead.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.573
Yeah. So, I was with him.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.608
And not when he got shot.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.677
I went back for my cell phone.

12:57.744 --> 13:01.381
That's kind of lucky for you.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.117
Why are you asking me
all these questions anyway?

13:04.184 --> 13:06.419
You were there
when he was murdered, right?

13:06.486 --> 13:08.856
And what happened
to him will be dealt with.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.959
What's dealt with?

13:12.025 --> 13:15.395
I'm not saying anything
that would incriminate me.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.663
But right about now,

13:16.729 --> 13:18.999
some shaved heads in Hoover Park
are getting a message.

13:19.066 --> 13:22.569
DAVID:
So, 23rd Street's retaliating.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.472
Take one of mine,
I'm gonna take five of yours.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.143
DAVID: If 23rd Street
really is retaliating,

13:30.210 --> 13:31.979
there's no way
they knew Rhimes is FBI.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.613
Just got off the
phone with Walker.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.415
A gang unit in Hoover
Park just confirmed

13:35.482 --> 13:37.084
three separate
drive-by shootings.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.052
23rd Street's suspected.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.021
So, Rhimes' cover
was still intact?

13:41.088 --> 13:43.023
But if his cover
wasn't blown,

13:43.090 --> 13:45.358
why the hell was he killed?

13:57.204 --> 13:58.771
DON: If Rhimes' cover
wasn't blown...

13:58.838 --> 14:01.208
MEGAN: Then on the street,
he was just another gang member.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.575
What got him killed then?

14:02.642 --> 14:04.244
Turf dispute? Wrong tattoos?

14:04.311 --> 14:06.379
23rd Street retaliated
against Hoover Park

14:06.446 --> 14:08.415
because they think that
they killed Rhimes.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.683
WALKER: These two gangs have
been going at each other hard,

14:10.750 --> 14:13.220
ever since 23rd Street
ripped off a drug shipment

14:13.286 --> 14:14.587
from Hoover Park's supplier.

14:14.654 --> 14:17.390
Yeah, but your guys keep track
of all gang rivalries, right?

14:17.457 --> 14:18.525
An enemies list.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.461
Every time a name comes up in
a beef with a rival gangbanger,

14:21.528 --> 14:22.729
we write it down.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.131
DON:
I'd like to take a look

14:24.197 --> 14:26.033
at those field reports,
see if Rhimes was targeted

14:26.099 --> 14:27.968
for being 23rd Street
or it was personal or...

14:28.035 --> 14:29.536
Maybe we should look
into the personal side.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.105
Maybe he had a concern that he
didn't tell the prosecutor,

14:32.172 --> 14:33.606
but maybe he told his wife.

14:33.673 --> 14:34.908
Definitely worth checking out.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.044
Don, Charlie's here.
He's got something to show you.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.311
CHARLIE:
Now what you're seeing

14:38.378 --> 14:39.712
is a behavioral sequence
analysis.

14:39.779 --> 14:42.549
It's a sequential representation
of shootings

14:42.615 --> 14:43.750
over the past four years.

14:43.816 --> 14:44.884
DON:
And what does it get us?

14:44.952 --> 14:47.654
Well, this kind of dynamic graph
is an amazingly good predictor

14:47.720 --> 14:49.957
of what I've been calling
shooting chains.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.291
AGENT:
Shooting chains?

14:51.358 --> 14:54.194
Shootings that are linked-- one
to the next, then to the next.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.295
You mean retaliation shootings.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.696
We already know about all those.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.865
Well, what I'm saying is
that it might be possible

14:58.932 --> 15:01.901
to follow these shooting chains
back to the original shooter.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.670
Without witnesses
and without testimony?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.005
Visualize a tabletop

15:05.072 --> 15:07.507
covered with dominos.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.843
The first domino to fall is
the start of a shooting chain.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.081
Shooting chains can be short,
shooting chains can be long.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.849
Some shooting chains initiate
other branching chains.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.586
Now we're looking at these
shooting chains after the fact,

15:19.652 --> 15:21.788
after all the dominos
have fallen.

15:21.854 --> 15:24.491
And reconstructing these chains
is going to be difficult.

15:24.557 --> 15:25.358
But there is a way.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.593
By using hierarchical
network graphs

15:26.659 --> 15:28.161
in combination with
Poisson Clumping,

15:28.228 --> 15:30.530
we can work our way backwards,

15:30.597 --> 15:33.300
back to the original dominos
that started the chain.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.035
DAVID: Which means we could
identify the inciters--

15:35.102 --> 15:37.470
gang members most prone
to violence.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.206
-CHARLIE: That's correct.
-And if we could

15:39.272 --> 15:40.640
somehow remove them
from the loop...

15:40.707 --> 15:42.942
Theoretically,
we stop future shootings.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.077
You got it. That's it.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.446
Well, that's
an interesting notion.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.948
Interesting,
yet you don't seem interested.

15:49.016 --> 15:52.685
Well, it's a matter
of priorities.

15:52.752 --> 15:56.423
18 percent of these shootings

15:56.489 --> 15:59.292
killed or injured
innocent bystanders.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.461
I think some of those people
were ten years old.

16:01.528 --> 16:06.066
35 percent of the victims
were 16 years old or younger.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.300
Yeah, I know.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.369
I'm at those crime scenes,
and I don't like it.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.238
But no matter how many
gangbangers we pull in,

16:11.304 --> 16:12.772
more are gonna come
to take their place.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.108
And frankly, to most people,
stopping bad guys

16:15.175 --> 16:17.344
from killing bad guys
isn't a major priority.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.112
Yeah, again,
some of these shootings

16:19.179 --> 16:21.014
involve innocent people.

16:21.081 --> 16:21.781
All right, Charlie, hey...

16:21.848 --> 16:23.383
That's fine.
Excuse me. That's fine.

16:23.450 --> 16:24.917
You know, you'll just
have to forgive me

16:24.984 --> 16:27.354
if I feel that citywide gang
violence isn't something

16:27.420 --> 16:28.621
that one mathematician
can stop.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.257
I'm gonna have to run.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.258
Brief the next team.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.692
I'll talk to you later,
all right?

16:32.759 --> 16:34.394
-Look, hey...
-Hey, I'm not here

16:34.461 --> 16:35.662
to start trouble with anyone.

16:35.728 --> 16:36.663
Listen, listen, all right?

16:36.729 --> 16:38.965
Let's just concentrate
on Rhimes for now, okay?

16:39.032 --> 16:40.533
You got to give the guy a break.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.170
He's been at this for,
you know, over 20 years now.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.974
We were planning a family.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.008
It was gonna happen

16:49.076 --> 16:52.745
right after Anton's undercover
assignment was over.

16:52.812 --> 16:56.716
I'm really sorry.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.086
It's funny, you know,
he hasn't been home

16:59.152 --> 17:02.989
all that much
these last few months, so...

17:03.056 --> 17:06.193
not having him around,
it really hasn't hit me yet.

17:06.259 --> 17:09.762
I was hoping I could
ask you a couple of questions.

17:09.829 --> 17:13.566
Sure.

17:13.633 --> 17:17.003
Has your husband mentioned being
afraid of anyone or anything

17:17.070 --> 17:18.771
in the last couple of weeks?

17:18.838 --> 17:22.709
Anton afraid?

17:22.775 --> 17:24.544
He didn't have the gene.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.678
( chuckles )

17:25.745 --> 17:28.047
I'm the one
who did the worrying.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.016
So he never mentioned anyone.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.419
We didn't talk very much lately.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.622
Like I said,
he hasn't been around.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.857
I'm in my last year
of architecture school,

17:37.924 --> 17:42.695
and there just
never seemed to be enough time.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.898
I understand.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.201
But I could tell he was excited.

17:48.268 --> 17:53.540
You know, he'd get that way
whenever he was getting close.

17:55.542 --> 17:59.946
I think the people he was after
were starting to trust him,

18:00.012 --> 18:05.785
starting to let him
make decisions.

18:10.723 --> 18:15.362
I can't even give him
the funeral he deserves.

18:15.428 --> 18:20.433
Can't even bury him with honor,

18:20.500 --> 18:25.238
because they still
don't want to blow his cover.

18:32.412 --> 18:36.115
It's quite a job you have.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.690
AMITA:
This is another FBI project,

18:43.756 --> 18:46.526
judging from the references
to firearm violence.

18:46.593 --> 18:47.927
Yeah, well,
an FBI agent was killed.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.929
I'm trying to identify
possible motives.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.632
By identifying all the links
and patterns, is that it?

18:52.699 --> 18:54.201
So many of these murders
are connected

18:54.267 --> 18:59.071
that I'm having trouble seeing
past the initial relationships.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.040
Looks like
they're chain reactions.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.009
I'm calling them
shooting chains.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.143
You're trying to solve all

19:04.211 --> 19:05.578
the shooting chains,
is that right?

19:05.645 --> 19:06.579
Not just one.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.614
Uh, yeah.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.716
Oh, Charles, consider Galileo.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.451
Now he was interested

19:11.518 --> 19:12.685
in a single specific problem--

19:12.752 --> 19:14.086
getting a closer look
at the planets.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.457
So he built the most powerful
telescope of his time.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.426
That's right,
and he saw the moons of Jupiter,

19:19.492 --> 19:21.328
thus proving that
not everything in the universe

19:21.394 --> 19:22.429
revolved around the Earth.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.130
The point, Fleinhardt,
the point.

19:24.197 --> 19:27.434
The point, Mr. Eppes, is that
formulating a grand theory

19:27.500 --> 19:30.537
is often best done by focusing

19:30.603 --> 19:34.874
on a single, small question.

19:34.941 --> 19:35.842
Why did you print out

19:35.908 --> 19:37.310
-all these photos?
-I don't know.

19:37.377 --> 19:40.580
I was looking at the ages
of the victims,

19:40.647 --> 19:43.182
and I wanted to see their faces.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.757
MAN:
All right, Eric.

19:50.823 --> 19:53.059
Bye, Damian.

19:53.125 --> 20:00.367
( hip-hop blaring )

20:03.236 --> 20:06.038
Let me give you
a hand there.

20:06.105 --> 20:08.575
Thanks.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.444
You're the one that was
chasing that kid earlier.

20:11.511 --> 20:12.912
That's right.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.047
Who are you after now?

20:15.114 --> 20:16.916
I'm not after anyone.

20:16.983 --> 20:20.219
Don't get me wrong, those
that run need chasing.

20:20.287 --> 20:23.990
It's the kids I worry about.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.159
They can still be saved.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.495
John Owens.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.697
David Sinclair.
Nice to meet you.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.499
The lady
I was talking to earlier...

20:32.565 --> 20:33.433
Olivia?

20:33.500 --> 20:34.567
She still around?

20:34.634 --> 20:37.236
Olivia's always around.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.839
She's probably inside.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.541
Thanks.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.212
Hope you didn't come by

20:46.279 --> 20:47.580
to make more trouble.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.982
No, I just wanted to ask you
a few questions,

20:50.049 --> 20:51.083
that's all.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.118
About Anthony?

20:52.184 --> 20:53.386
No, we cut Anthony loose.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.689
Turns out he really
didn't do anything.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.658
At least you admit
when you make a mistake.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.294
There was a murder
down here the other night.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.530
Been a bunch of murders
down here.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.264
This one had
a few witnesses though.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.098
I thought maybe

21:06.165 --> 21:08.267
you could help me
get someone to come forward,

21:08.335 --> 21:09.769
give us some more info.

21:09.836 --> 21:10.770
( chuckles )

21:10.837 --> 21:13.005
Help you?

21:13.072 --> 21:14.273
Wait a minute.

21:14.341 --> 21:15.542
Just hold on for a second.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.745
You have a problem with
trying to solve a murder?

21:18.811 --> 21:20.547
People get shot
around here every day.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.014
Never much effort
finding witnesses.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.717
It just makes me wonder,
why all the interest now?

21:27.554 --> 21:30.690
Who was it that got shot?

21:30.757 --> 21:32.825
Look, whatever you think
about me, okay,

21:32.892 --> 21:33.860
about the police,

21:33.926 --> 21:36.162
people around here
seem to listen to you.

21:36.228 --> 21:37.897
And I am asking for your help.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.899
You mean you're asking me
to trust you.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.101
Yeah. I guess I am.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.336
And I'm supposed to do that

21:43.403 --> 21:45.037
because you have a badge?

21:45.104 --> 21:45.838
I'm sorry.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.206
You haven't been
down here enough

21:47.273 --> 21:48.274
for me to trust you.

21:48.341 --> 21:49.842
A man lost his life.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.612
I'm not here to restore
your faith in the system.

21:52.679 --> 21:55.982
I am just trying
to find his killer.

21:58.518 --> 22:02.655
If you think you want to
help with that, call me.

22:13.733 --> 22:14.467
Donny.

22:14.534 --> 22:15.468
-Dad.
-What's going on?

22:15.535 --> 22:17.604
Not much.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.373
Things are just not
coming together on this one.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.608
Yeah, I know.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.710
I saw some of what
Charlie's been working on.

22:23.776 --> 22:24.911
Charlie.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.379
He's looking
at every gang shooting

22:26.446 --> 22:28.481
for the last four years,
which is a lot.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.917
Well, he follows the numbers.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.719
The more something
seems unsolvable,

22:32.785 --> 22:34.320
the more he wants to solve it.

22:34.387 --> 22:35.488
Well, he's wasting time.

22:35.555 --> 22:36.889
He's looking at way too much.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.792
Look, I don't think he expects
to solve something

22:39.859 --> 22:41.060
that's been going on that long.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.763
I mean, with decades
of bad urban planning,

22:43.830 --> 22:45.498
racism and economic blight,

22:45.565 --> 22:47.700
gang violence
doesn't go away overnight.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.101
It's just that it's Charlie,
you know?

22:49.168 --> 22:51.438
He has to get to understand
the entire picture.

22:52.304 --> 22:54.674
Hey. Don, hey.

22:54.741 --> 22:55.842
I got news for you.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.977
Yeah? On Rhimes
or the 4,000 other shootings?

22:58.044 --> 22:59.779
Both.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.781
I was able to discover
a pattern.

23:01.848 --> 23:04.316
Nine shootings,
all of them connected, right?

23:04.383 --> 23:05.818
With Agent Rhimes,
you've got ten.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.920
Connected, as in
all part of the same chain?

23:07.987 --> 23:11.123
No. Each one of the ten is the
start of its own shooting chain.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.124
And Don, I think

23:12.191 --> 23:13.392
they're all the work

23:13.460 --> 23:14.360
of the same killer.

23:14.427 --> 23:15.495
So you're saying Rhimes' killer

23:15.562 --> 23:17.764
-is responsible for ten murders?
-No, far more.

23:17.830 --> 23:20.933
I mean, he may have pulled the
trigger on those ten murders,

23:21.000 --> 23:22.502
but they aren't
his only victims.

23:22.569 --> 23:23.570
ALAN:
Right, because of

23:23.636 --> 23:25.171
all the retaliation
shootings, you mean.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.072
Right. When you include

23:26.138 --> 23:28.040
all the victims
from these ten shooting chains,

23:28.107 --> 23:31.611
you've got yourself one person
setting off over 60 murders.

23:47.226 --> 23:48.060
Hey, guys, listen up.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.630
I got nine separate
gang shootings

23:50.697 --> 23:51.998
over the last two years.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.733
Charlie thinks they
are all related

23:53.800 --> 23:55.034
to Rhimes' murder.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.035
Related how?

23:56.102 --> 23:56.903
All the same shooter.

23:58.104 --> 23:58.871
The same shooter?

23:58.938 --> 24:00.106
DON:
That's right.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.340
WALKER:
Ten kills?

24:01.407 --> 24:03.610
I don't care how hard-core

24:03.676 --> 24:04.844
a gangbanger
we're talking about,

24:04.911 --> 24:06.345
this guy would be a legend.

24:06.412 --> 24:07.446
He's right.

24:07.514 --> 24:08.781
Plus, the shootings are spread

24:08.848 --> 24:10.683
throughout completely
different gang territories,

24:10.750 --> 24:12.284
exploiting totally
different rivalries.

24:12.351 --> 24:13.986
Trust me, if Charlie's math
says they're connected,

24:14.053 --> 24:15.522
the odds are
they are connected, okay?

24:15.588 --> 24:16.756
I have three different
files here.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.024
All three victims
are different races.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.291
They also all have
a different weapon.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.628
.25 cal.-- what's this, .44...
that's a nine millimeter.

24:21.694 --> 24:22.629
Yeah, same here.

24:22.695 --> 24:23.763
They're all different.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.198
That's why we need to look at
this stuff fresh, right?

24:26.265 --> 24:27.534
We need to run the prints again,

24:27.600 --> 24:28.735
the ballistics,
anything we can, okay?

24:28.801 --> 24:30.603
Hold on a second.

24:30.670 --> 24:31.638
You see something?

24:31.704 --> 24:33.640
MEGAN:
All three of these--

24:33.706 --> 24:35.107
four, if you count Rhimes--

24:35.174 --> 24:37.143
are single homicides;

24:37.209 --> 24:38.678
the victim is isolated.

24:38.745 --> 24:40.880
-Yeah, this one is, too.
How about these? -Same.

24:40.947 --> 24:41.648
Yeah, here, too.

24:41.714 --> 24:42.381
Yeah, this one as well.

24:42.448 --> 24:43.516
So?

24:43.583 --> 24:45.384
So, that doesn't happen
by accident.

24:45.451 --> 24:46.252
MEGAN:
It might just be

24:46.318 --> 24:47.119
something about opportunity,

24:47.186 --> 24:49.088
or it might be part
of a bigger plan.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.790
But either way,
it supports Charlie's theory

24:50.857 --> 24:51.924
that there's a single killer

24:51.991 --> 24:54.226
with a specific method
of finding his victims.

24:54.293 --> 24:57.129
All right,
let's check into this; let's go.

25:01.433 --> 25:02.501
Professor Fleinhardt.

25:02.569 --> 25:03.670
Oh, Agent Reeves.

25:03.736 --> 25:04.804
-Hey, Amita.
-Hi.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.539
-Charlie.
-Hey.

25:06.606 --> 25:09.475
Wow, you have
a lot of victim photos.

25:09.542 --> 25:10.509
CHARLIE:
Lot of victims.

25:10.577 --> 25:12.444
Charlie, Don told me
your theory,

25:12.511 --> 25:13.445
and, assuming you're right,

25:13.512 --> 25:14.614
I'm trying to figure out

25:14.681 --> 25:16.683
how the killer
is finding his victims.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.417
And I don't have
a behavioral model yet,

25:18.484 --> 25:19.952
but it seems that
it has to be

25:20.019 --> 25:21.120
more than just opportunity.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.521
And I can tell you
mathematically,

25:22.589 --> 25:23.556
yeah, it has to be.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.457
What does that mean? Why?

25:25.524 --> 25:26.793
Each of the murders started

25:26.859 --> 25:28.094
an exceptionally long
shooting chain.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.696
Now, the average
for a shooing chain

25:29.762 --> 25:30.963
is about 2.8 shootings, right?

25:31.030 --> 25:32.198
Well, these are all much higher.

25:32.264 --> 25:35.034
Look-- four, five, six,
seven shootings, even.

25:35.101 --> 25:36.235
Statistically,
that wouldn't happen

25:36.302 --> 25:37.970
if he had chosen the victims
at random.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.939
The chains would have conformed
to the overall average.

25:40.006 --> 25:41.140
So, there is definitely a method

25:41.207 --> 25:42.474
to how he's choosing
his victims.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.711
In other words, the killer's
choosing his victims

25:44.777 --> 25:46.545
specifically to maximize
retaliation.

25:46.613 --> 25:50.082
So he's trying to take out as
many gang members as possible.

25:50.149 --> 25:52.284
But wouldn't that also endanger
members of his own gang?

25:52.351 --> 25:54.721
I mean, they're surely
going to be the target

25:54.787 --> 25:55.622
of the retaliation.

25:55.688 --> 25:56.723
You see, now you're making

25:56.789 --> 25:58.457
this rather large assumption.

25:58.524 --> 26:03.262
I mean, how do we know that
the shooter is a gang member?

26:08.935 --> 26:10.903
DAVID:
A serial killer?

26:10.970 --> 26:12.805
MEGAN: Targeting gang members
for the same reason

26:12.872 --> 26:14.841
other serial killers
target prostitutes.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.175
Because nobody really
cares about the victims.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.611
Exactly. And then they
can go on killing for longer

26:18.678 --> 26:19.946
without anyone noticing.

26:20.012 --> 26:22.381
I mean, this guy's been
out there for like two years.

26:22.448 --> 26:23.482
And if he hadn't killed Rhimes,

26:23.549 --> 26:24.751
we still wouldn't
know who he is.

26:24.817 --> 26:25.885
( cell phone rings )

26:25.952 --> 26:28.020
Charlie says he's been
maximizing retaliations.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.722
He'd have to know
a lot about gangs.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.290
I mean, about their structure,
how they function.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.626
You're right, that's
how he knows who to go after.

26:33.693 --> 26:34.727
All right, yeah.

26:34.794 --> 26:35.762
Yeah, I got you.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.730
That was Ballistics.
One of the slugs

26:37.797 --> 26:39.065
we've been testing
hit on the computer.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.833
Turns out the same gun
that fired it

26:40.900 --> 26:42.334
was used in a liquor store

26:42.401 --> 26:43.169
robbery-homicide.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.237
Well, let's run down the guy
who owns the gun--

26:45.304 --> 26:45.938
find our shooter.

26:46.005 --> 26:47.173
The problem is, this gun's

26:47.239 --> 26:48.641
not even supposed
to exist anymore.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.777
What does that mean?

26:50.843 --> 26:52.144
It was turned in to
one of those buy-back programs

26:52.211 --> 26:53.612
three years ago--
turn in your gun,

26:53.680 --> 26:55.014
get a free gift
at Christmastime.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.415
And those guns are
supposed to be destroyed?

26:56.482 --> 26:58.685
Yeah, they're supposed to be,
but obviously this one wasn't.

26:58.751 --> 27:01.153
-You got this? Thank you.
-Yep, got it.

27:01.220 --> 27:05.191
( hip-hop blaring )

27:21.507 --> 27:22.975
Yo, Hoover Park!

27:32.919 --> 27:33.986
( tires squealing )

27:46.532 --> 27:48.034
( helicopter circling )

27:49.435 --> 27:51.804
( siren wailing )

27:58.644 --> 28:00.112
This is part of
the shooting chain

28:00.179 --> 28:02.248
related to
Anton Rhimes' murder.

28:02.314 --> 28:04.450
23rd Street retaliated
against Hoover Park

28:04.516 --> 28:05.584
this afternoon.

28:05.651 --> 28:07.153
Tonight, Hoover Park
strikes back.

28:07.219 --> 28:08.654
It's probably not over, either.

28:08.721 --> 28:10.456
DAVID:
No.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.224
Ah, man, that's Anthony, huh?

28:12.291 --> 28:14.927
Been better off
if you'd locked him up.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.196
Hey, David, let me talk
to you for a second.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.000
Did some checking
into that gun,

28:21.067 --> 28:23.269
the one that went missing
from the buy-back program.

28:23.335 --> 28:24.536
Yeah...

28:24.603 --> 28:25.504
Dug up some paperwork.

28:25.571 --> 28:27.239
Take a look at this.

28:27.306 --> 28:30.009
The signature on the
bottom of that receipt.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.211
"Lieutenant Gary Walker."

28:34.446 --> 28:37.216
Could be completely innocent,
but at some point or another,

28:37.283 --> 28:39.151
the gun that killed Rhimes
passed through Walker's hands.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.352
( indistinct radio
communication )

28:46.258 --> 28:47.927
I don't think I like
what you're suggesting.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.962
Well, it's not a question
of whether you like it,

28:50.029 --> 28:51.497
because your name
is on the form, right?

28:51.563 --> 28:53.065
That's your name,
it's not a forgery,

28:53.132 --> 28:55.401
so the investigation brings
us to you; I'm sorry.

28:55.467 --> 28:57.503
My name's on about
a thousand forms.

28:57.569 --> 28:58.938
I've been working
the buy-back program

28:59.005 --> 29:00.807
in my division for six years.

29:00.873 --> 29:01.808
Collecting weapons

29:01.874 --> 29:03.209
that were supposed to be
melted down.

29:03.275 --> 29:06.846
You know how many guns
we take in off the street?

29:06.913 --> 29:09.115
How many lives we save
because of it?

29:09.181 --> 29:10.582
Then why don't you tell me
how a gun that you signed for

29:10.649 --> 29:12.418
ends up back on the street
in the hands of a killer.

29:12.484 --> 29:13.352
Who the hell knows;

29:13.419 --> 29:15.087
security's not perfect
at these things,

29:15.154 --> 29:16.488
a lot of people
come through here.

29:16.555 --> 29:21.961
Now, we probably took 50 guns
off the street that day.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.930
If one of them slipped through,
got back out,

29:23.996 --> 29:26.198
that's still 49 others
that we took in.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.033
I don't care about them,
because they're not

29:27.099 --> 29:27.967
in the hands of a murderer.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.468
Oh come on, Eppes,
we're talking about

29:29.535 --> 29:31.503
a motivated individual
out there killing.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.840
If it hadn't been this gun,
it'd been another one,

29:33.906 --> 29:35.307
and you and I both know that.

29:35.374 --> 29:35.842
All right...

29:35.908 --> 29:36.876
COLBY:
Don? Excuse me.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.510
The guys upstairs
ran a full audit.

29:38.577 --> 29:41.147
More than a dozen guns
from the buy-back program

29:41.213 --> 29:43.149
never made it to the furnace.

29:47.753 --> 29:48.921
( scoffing laugh )

29:48.988 --> 29:52.258
Okay, then, just tell me
how the program works.

29:52.324 --> 29:53.759
What is the exact
chain of possession?

29:53.826 --> 29:58.197
There's usually maybe
five or six drop-off locations:

29:58.264 --> 30:00.266
churches, community centers...

30:00.332 --> 30:01.267
DAVID:
Community Centers?

30:01.333 --> 30:02.969
Is there any way
to check each weapon

30:03.035 --> 30:05.004
against the location
it was turned in to?

30:05.071 --> 30:06.138
COLBY:
Well, just by the responsible

30:06.205 --> 30:07.339
police officer's signatures.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.575
And, it turns out,
all these guns were signed for

30:09.641 --> 30:11.310
by you, Lieutenant.

30:11.377 --> 30:12.711
DAVID:
Which means they were all

30:12.778 --> 30:14.413
turned in at
the same location.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.519
Right.

30:20.586 --> 30:24.556
Which is the
23rd Street Community Center.

30:26.192 --> 30:27.894
You do see
the obscene irony here,

30:27.960 --> 30:29.695
don't you, Agent Sinclair?

30:29.761 --> 30:31.197
We're one of the few places
in the neighborhood

30:31.263 --> 30:32.298
that's really
trying to do some good,

30:32.364 --> 30:33.432
and you're coming down on us.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.034
Ms. Rawlings, I am not
coming down on you.

30:35.101 --> 30:36.435
The gun buy-back is
a good program.

30:36.502 --> 30:37.269
That may be,

30:37.336 --> 30:38.871
but we still need to see
those records.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.006
We need to know

30:40.072 --> 30:41.040
everyone who was working here

30:41.107 --> 30:42.341
the day the guns were collected.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.043
These are people
who try to help out.

30:44.110 --> 30:44.776
People who contribute.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.212
Do you have any idea

30:46.278 --> 30:47.846
how hard it's going to be
to get volunteers

30:47.914 --> 30:49.015
if they can't lend a hand here

30:49.081 --> 30:50.116
without getting a visit
from the FBI?

30:50.182 --> 30:52.184
Ms. Rawlings, I want
those names and addresses.

30:52.251 --> 30:54.420
Anyone who had access
to those guns.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.022
I know you do
background checks.

30:56.088 --> 30:57.523
What if I won't
give them to you?

31:01.660 --> 31:04.330
We can get a court order
and make this public.

31:04.396 --> 31:05.965
And, I suppose,
the community center

31:06.032 --> 31:08.901
could find itself liable
to the victims' families

31:08.968 --> 31:10.136
if it came to that.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.241
I hope you're
really proud of yourself.

31:15.307 --> 31:16.842
You're doing a whole lot

31:16.909 --> 31:18.377
to give back to this community.

31:23.149 --> 31:24.083
Ten people
had the opportunity

31:24.150 --> 31:25.084
to get their hands on
the guns

31:25.151 --> 31:26.085
that were turned in

31:26.152 --> 31:28.387
at the 23rd Street
Community Center.

31:28.454 --> 31:29.655
Those are the background checks
they ran.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.991
Well, we can probably
rule out the priest, huh?

31:32.058 --> 31:33.926
These six here strike me
as possibilities.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.928
They could have the necessary
gang knowledge,

31:35.995 --> 31:38.230
and the ability to pull
something like this off.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.166
All right, so we just
need to find a way

31:40.232 --> 31:41.300
to connect one of them
to the victims.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.269
Specifically,
the first victim.

31:43.335 --> 31:44.603
Because with serial killers,

31:44.670 --> 31:46.705
the first victim
almost always has significance.

31:46.772 --> 31:47.706
It's the first kill.

31:47.773 --> 31:49.341
It's a really big step.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.877
Means it's personal,
or someone close, accessible.

31:51.944 --> 31:53.545
So, victim number one is

31:53.612 --> 31:55.681
where we're looking
to find our link.

31:58.517 --> 31:59.551
This is Omar Brice.

31:59.618 --> 32:01.853
He was shot outside
of a party two years ago.

32:01.920 --> 32:02.854
All right.

32:02.921 --> 32:03.789
Well, I'll take the family.

32:03.855 --> 32:04.790
You want
to pull his record,

32:04.856 --> 32:05.791
talk to his P.O.?

32:05.857 --> 32:07.693
I'll see what Walker's
gang unit has on him.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.061
Has to be a link between him

32:09.128 --> 32:10.662
and one of our suspects.

32:13.532 --> 32:14.133
CHARLIE:
Hey.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.867
Are you still working?

32:15.934 --> 32:18.704
Yeah, I just needed a break.

32:18.770 --> 32:19.505
Where's Dad?

32:19.571 --> 32:20.439
He's upstairs.

32:20.506 --> 32:22.741
He just got home from
his date with, um... Donna.

32:22.808 --> 32:23.742
Oh, yeah?

32:23.809 --> 32:24.876
So?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.012
-How'd it go?
-ALAN: Fine.

32:26.078 --> 32:27.779
The date went fine.

32:27.846 --> 32:28.780
DON:
Yeah?

32:28.847 --> 32:30.149
What'd you end up getting her?

32:30.216 --> 32:31.417
Well, according to
those London mathematicians,

32:31.483 --> 32:33.719
you should have sprung for
the very expensive dinner, Dad.

32:33.785 --> 32:34.653
Nah, I disagree.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.155
I think women want
something that'll last.

32:36.222 --> 32:38.757
Something they can remember
the night by, at least.

32:38.824 --> 32:41.560
That would be ideal.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.229
I'm afraid to ask.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.463
What did you get her?

32:46.232 --> 32:48.034
-Soap.
-Soap.

32:49.235 --> 32:50.602
Very expensive soap.

32:50.669 --> 32:51.170
Yeah?

32:51.237 --> 32:52.038
How'd that go over?

32:52.104 --> 32:55.074
Well, uh...

32:55.141 --> 32:56.575
Honestly speaking,
she wasn't wowed.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.944
I mean, she was
very polite about it,

32:59.011 --> 33:01.280
but she, uh,
wasn't, uh... wowed.

33:01.347 --> 33:02.614
Ruined the whole date,
didn't it?

33:02.681 --> 33:04.616
It didn't ruin the date.
The date was fine.

33:04.683 --> 33:05.684
You're home at 9:30.

33:05.751 --> 33:08.520
I didn't say
it couldn't have been better.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.062
You look exhausted,
you know that?

33:16.128 --> 33:17.229
I'm just killing myself

33:17.296 --> 33:19.231
trying to find a link
between our suspects

33:19.298 --> 33:20.232
and his first victim.

33:20.299 --> 33:22.668
Well, at least
you have suspects.

33:22.734 --> 33:23.935
Hey, Don, why are you...

33:24.002 --> 33:25.137
why are you looking
to link

33:25.204 --> 33:26.472
your suspects
to the first victim?

33:26.538 --> 33:27.873
Because when it comes
to serial murders,

33:27.939 --> 33:29.708
there's always significance
to the first victim.

33:29.775 --> 33:32.844
Well, I understand that,
but what I mean is

33:32.911 --> 33:35.347
why aren't you looking at
the whole first chain?

33:36.882 --> 33:38.884
What do you mean?

33:38.950 --> 33:41.853
Now, remember I compared
the shooting chains to dominos?

33:41.920 --> 33:43.422
Right? Okay.

33:43.489 --> 33:44.723
So, let's say I'm the killer,

33:44.790 --> 33:47.693
and I have reason
to want this gang member killed.

33:47.759 --> 33:48.527
We'll call him "Bob."

33:48.594 --> 33:50.096
Now, I could just
shoot Bob myself.

33:50.162 --> 33:51.630
The smarter move:

33:51.697 --> 33:56.602
Assuming I know the gang
structure well enough...

33:56.668 --> 33:59.805
instead of shooting Bob,
I shoot "Tim,"

33:59.871 --> 34:02.874
knowing that shooting Tim
will set off a chain

34:02.941 --> 34:03.975
that ultimately results...

34:04.042 --> 34:07.045
in the shooting
of my real target, Bob.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.581
That is smart.

34:09.648 --> 34:11.783
You're never involved
in the shooting of Bob.

34:11.850 --> 34:14.019
So, since you don't have
a motive for killing Tim,

34:14.086 --> 34:15.387
then you're not
a suspect there, either.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.123
Check the whole first chain,

34:17.189 --> 34:18.757
your target's going to be
in there.

34:18.824 --> 34:19.825
Charlie, thanks.

34:25.364 --> 34:26.732
What are we working on?

34:26.798 --> 34:27.766
First shooting chain.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.302
We only looked
at the first link, Omar Brice.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.104
But what if Brice
wasn't the real target?

34:32.171 --> 34:33.772
What if the real
target was someone

34:33.839 --> 34:34.940
further down the chain?

34:35.006 --> 34:36.542
That makes sense.

34:36.608 --> 34:40.479
At the time of Brice's murder,
LAPD focused on three suspects.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.214
They're all Hoover Park
gang members.

34:42.281 --> 34:43.982
They had all made threats
against Brice.

34:44.049 --> 34:45.016
Carlos Alvarez,

34:45.083 --> 34:47.018
Jesse Orosco, and Peter Mendez.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.688
I have the murder file on Orosco
and Jesse right here.

34:49.755 --> 34:53.091
He was gunned down one week
after the Brice slaying.

34:53.159 --> 34:56.262
-So Orosco was victim number two
in the shooting chain. -Yeah.

34:59.165 --> 35:00.532
Wait a minute.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.501
Where's the file on
the community center volunteers?

35:02.568 --> 35:04.403
It's right over here.

35:04.470 --> 35:05.671
Why? What do you got?

35:05.737 --> 35:06.872
This kid, Orosco,

35:06.938 --> 35:09.675
at the time ofhis murder, he was
a suspect in another drive-by--

35:09.741 --> 35:11.177
one that killed
a 15-year-old kid

35:11.243 --> 35:12.378
named Brian Owens.

35:12.444 --> 35:16.415
Kid's father John works
at the community center.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.250
Really?

35:18.317 --> 35:21.787
He was present
at all the gun buy-backs.

35:23.755 --> 35:24.690
So this guy's son

35:24.756 --> 35:25.624
gets shot in a drive-by.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.459
He sets off a shooting chain
that ends up

35:27.526 --> 35:29.094
killing the gangbanger
that's responsible.

35:29.161 --> 35:30.396
Only the killing

35:30.462 --> 35:33.499
didn't stop there.

35:33.565 --> 35:36.368
( indistinct police radio
transmission )

35:36.435 --> 35:38.837
( helicopter circling )

35:44.142 --> 35:46.011
Spotter says Owens
is inside alone.

35:46.077 --> 35:48.480
I tried calling, but
he's not picking up.

35:48.547 --> 35:49.648
COLBY:
The dude's armed for sure.

35:49.715 --> 35:50.916
Talked to one
of his neighbors.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.485
Says he sees him out on
his porch at night with a rifle.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.621
He's pretty sure it's an AK.

35:55.687 --> 35:57.356
Plus all the guns he got
from the buy-back program.

35:57.423 --> 36:00.259
What we need is to lure him
near a window,

36:00.326 --> 36:01.693
give one of my snipers
a clean shot.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.662
Shoot first, ask
questions later, right?

36:03.729 --> 36:05.397
Lives are in danger here,
Agent Sinclair--

36:05.464 --> 36:07.399
lives of the people
who live here.

36:07.466 --> 36:10.269
Don, I met this guy.

36:10.336 --> 36:12.137
Let me see if I
can talk to him.

36:12.204 --> 36:15.407
Just give me a shot.

36:15.474 --> 36:18.210
Maybe it doesn't end
with a sniper's bullet.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.713
All right.

36:37.263 --> 36:40.131
DAVID:
John Owens, can you hear me?

36:40.198 --> 36:41.199
It's Agent Sinclair.

36:41.267 --> 36:44.069
I helped you with
the tables the other day

36:44.135 --> 36:45.170
at the community center.

36:45.237 --> 36:46.905
You remember?

36:48.707 --> 36:49.741
Hold!

36:49.808 --> 36:50.676
Hold! Hold!

36:50.742 --> 36:52.678
Calm down, John!

36:52.744 --> 36:54.280
Calm down!

36:54.346 --> 36:55.881
Easy.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.183
Lower that rifle.

36:58.250 --> 37:02.187
Get a man in position.

37:02.254 --> 37:04.423
I got nothing to say
to you, Sinclair.

37:04.490 --> 37:08.494
Okay, maybe you
could just listen.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.928
I know about your son.

37:09.995 --> 37:12.531
I know what happened to him.

37:17.102 --> 37:20.906
He was 15 years old.

37:20.972 --> 37:23.409
Fifteen.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.544
Only I couldn't protect him.

37:25.611 --> 37:27.446
I know.

37:27.513 --> 37:29.214
John, it should have
never happened.

37:29.281 --> 37:31.983
But what you're doing,
more people are gonna get hurt.

37:32.050 --> 37:35.487
It's too late for all that.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.889
What about the kids?

37:37.956 --> 37:40.459
Remember the ones you said
could still be saved?

37:40.526 --> 37:42.828
What about them, John?

37:42.894 --> 37:44.763
They still need you.

37:44.830 --> 37:47.232
I'm going to jail;
we both know that.

37:47.299 --> 37:49.535
John, listen to me.

37:49.601 --> 37:52.471
You put that gun down,
and you come on out here.

37:52.538 --> 37:58.444
Nobody else has to
get hurt today, okay?

38:09.087 --> 38:10.989
John.

38:20.599 --> 38:24.703
DAVID:
John! Talk to me.

38:24.770 --> 38:26.304
John, keep talking to me, man.

38:26.372 --> 38:29.941
I'm right here!

38:32.678 --> 38:34.746
John!

38:49.060 --> 38:51.129
Hey, John!

38:51.196 --> 38:52.631
John, talk to me!

38:52.698 --> 38:53.164
David!

38:53.231 --> 38:54.400
You come back out here, John!

38:54.466 --> 38:56.034
-Get down!
-Come back to the window!

38:56.101 --> 38:57.369
( gunshot )

39:08.547 --> 39:11.750
Roll call.

39:23.995 --> 39:28.333
You okay?

39:28.400 --> 39:30.035
He shot himself.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.137
I heard.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.905
How's David?

39:36.007 --> 39:37.643
I sent him home.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.545
Colby's with him.

39:45.717 --> 39:50.889
Your man, Sinclair,
did himself proud today.

39:50.956 --> 39:53.825
He's got nothing
to feel bad about.

39:53.892 --> 39:56.127
We all went home safe, and...

39:56.194 --> 39:59.831
that's about as much
as you can ask.

40:06.538 --> 40:10.241
I was gonna go see Rhimes' wife

40:10.308 --> 40:11.843
and tell her what happened.

40:13.812 --> 40:17.983
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.388
Hello!

40:23.455 --> 40:25.356
ALAN:
Yeah, we're coming down.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.858
Yeah? Where are you going?

40:26.925 --> 40:28.894
CHARLIE:
He's got yet another date.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.530
Yeah? With-- what's her name--
Donna?

40:31.597 --> 40:33.398
I thought that wasn't
going to work out.

40:33.465 --> 40:35.166
Well, your brother came
to my rescue.

40:35.233 --> 40:36.568
CHARLIE:
I bought gift number two

40:36.635 --> 40:38.670
on that courtship
study list: theater tickets.

40:38.737 --> 40:41.139
According to those matheticians,
you know the British ones,

40:41.206 --> 40:42.407
this is a sure thing.

40:42.474 --> 40:43.709
Well, maybe not a sure thing,

40:43.775 --> 40:45.243
but it's certainly
better than, you know, soap.

40:45.310 --> 40:46.978
I don't need math
to figure that out.

40:47.045 --> 40:49.681
Uh, thanks for your insights,
my little Don Juan.

40:49.748 --> 40:51.216
So what are you up
to tonight, Donny?

40:51.282 --> 40:53.819
Well, I thought I was going
to hang with you boys, but...

40:53.885 --> 40:54.986
CHARLIE:
Oh, man, I wish you'd called.

40:55.053 --> 40:56.221
I'm going to Amita's
for dinner.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.223
Larry's going to be there--
why don't you join us?

40:58.289 --> 41:00.792
I think I'll just
grab something to eat here

41:00.859 --> 41:02.060
-and head home.
-Yeah? All right.

41:02.127 --> 41:04.129
-You sure?
-Yeah, go ahead, have fun.

41:04.195 --> 41:05.330
I got stuff to do, anyway.

41:05.396 --> 41:07.065
Have a good time.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.300
( mumbling ):
All right, all right.

41:09.367 --> 41:11.002
( door shuts )

41:36.494 --> 41:39.998
* *

41:40.065 --> 41:42.668
DAVID: Say someone
steps right up to you,

41:42.734 --> 41:44.202
all up in your grill.

41:44.269 --> 41:46.137
What are you going to do?

41:46.204 --> 41:50.876
I know what you want to do,
but what are you gonna do?

41:50.942 --> 41:53.511
The first thing you're
gonna do is think.

41:53.579 --> 41:56.414
What I'm trying to get you guys
to see is there are other ways

41:56.481 --> 41:59.751
to keep your respect
than just resorting to violence.

42:01.519 --> 42:05.456
You got more options than that.

42:05.523 --> 42:09.628
All right, y'all give me second?

42:12.463 --> 42:14.700
Hey, how you doing?

42:14.766 --> 42:16.702
My assistant told me

42:16.768 --> 42:19.805
someone was going take
over for John tonight.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.773
I didn't expect it
was gonna be you.

42:21.840 --> 42:26.344
Yeah, um... conflict resolution.

42:26.411 --> 42:29.414
Class like that really helped me
out when I was a kid, so...

42:29.480 --> 42:31.650
Oh, yeah?

42:31.717 --> 42:35.020
Yeah, you know, I was a bit
of a hard-ass.

42:35.086 --> 42:36.688
Was?

42:36.755 --> 42:40.525
( chuckles ):
You really do like to fight.

42:40.592 --> 42:43.929
( laughs )

42:44.830 --> 42:46.497
Maybe you want to sit in.

42:46.564 --> 42:50.401
You know, you could learn some
good ways to work things out.

42:50.468 --> 42:51.603
And I won't even call on you.

42:51.670 --> 42:55.406
-( laughs ) -I'll let you
sit there and just watch me.

42:55.473 --> 42:58.109
If you want to.

42:58.176 --> 42:59.244
Let them know
when you're done,

42:59.310 --> 43:01.312
so they can turn out the
lights when you leave.

43:01.379 --> 43:04.683
Yes, ma'am.

43:04.750 --> 43:08.553
And I assume an FBI agent
like you can figure out

43:08.620 --> 43:10.756
how to find my number.

43:18.630 --> 43:21.566
What are y'all looking at?

43:21.633 --> 43:22.968
All right, where were we?

43:23.034 --> 43:27.739
Talking about options--
options to violence, right?

43:27.806 --> 43:30.976
Say you're at the bus stop,
you're in line,

43:31.042 --> 43:34.379
somebody steps-- boom!--
right on your sneakers.

43:34.445 --> 43:35.781
What are you gonna do?

43:35.847 --> 43:38.850
* It will be all right *

43:38.917 --> 43:44.389
* And maybe love
will save you. *
