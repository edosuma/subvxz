(ominous music)

04:07.346 --> 04:10.460
- What the fuck are you
doing on my porch, mister?

04:10.460 --> 04:12.810
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

04:12.810 --> 04:14.703
- My wife asked you a question.

04:16.670 --> 04:19.103
- Oh, shit, Mr. Manson. I'm sorry.

04:20.020 --> 04:22.860
I'm sorry for the foul
language, Mr. Manson,

04:22.860 --> 04:27.260
and I'm sorry for using the
Lord's name in vain, OK?

04:27.260 --> 04:28.813
- I call bullshit.

04:30.740 --> 04:33.783
- Would you mind lowering the guns?

04:36.190 --> 04:38.533
Maybe one of the guns?

04:40.030 --> 04:41.200
- [Mrs. Manson] Well, get to it.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.460
- Get to what?
- The meters, buddy.

04:43.460 --> 04:45.297
Isn't that what you came here to do?

04:45.297 --> 04:47.520
"Gotta read those meters."

04:47.520 --> 04:50.320
- And then you can get the
fuckity-fuck-fuck outta here.

04:51.160 --> 04:51.993
- Yes, ma'am.

04:57.890 --> 05:00.803
- You putting that 5G in our meters?

05:02.933 --> 05:04.593
You're taking a mighty long time.

05:07.890 --> 05:08.793
- There we go.

05:10.260 --> 05:11.530
All done.

05:11.530 --> 05:13.280
- [Mrs. Manson] Good.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.590
- Painless.

05:15.590 --> 05:18.943
- It don't have to be.
I can make it painful.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.670
- Now, get off my porch, mister.

05:23.670 --> 05:28.163
- Of course. You have a
wonderful afternoon, ma'am.

05:29.670 --> 05:30.783
- Why would I do that?

05:31.778 --> 05:35.060
- It's a beautiful day, that's
all. Enjoy your afternoon.

05:35.060 --> 05:36.613
- Don't you tell me what to do.

05:37.650 --> 05:39.300
- What's there to enjoy about it?

05:40.434 --> 05:41.484
- The grass is green.

05:42.350 --> 05:44.316
The air is fresh.

05:44.316 --> 05:45.173
The sky is blue.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.337
- What did you say?

05:49.580 --> 05:51.320
- Uh, I don't know.

05:51.320 --> 05:54.110
The grass is green.

05:54.110 --> 05:56.510
- Nah, that part about the sky.

05:56.510 --> 05:59.047
What did you say about the sky?

05:59.047 --> 05:59.897
- The sky's blue.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.113
- Yeah, that.

06:04.604 --> 06:06.354
- It's a beautiful day, that's all.

06:10.150 --> 06:11.583
- The sky isn't blue.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.110
It's purple, you fucking pervert!

06:15.110 --> 06:18.480
- Yeah, you fucking pervert, it's purple!

06:18.480 --> 06:20.230
Like she said, purple!

06:23.930 --> 06:25.363
- Now, who the hell is this?

06:26.350 --> 06:29.190
- Axl, the delivery guy.

06:29.190 --> 06:31.260
- We ain't expecting no deliveries.

06:31.260 --> 06:35.030
- Well, you never are, but
you get one almost every day.

06:35.030 --> 06:37.230
Lower the gun, Mr. Manson.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.830
I don't wanna get shot
with rock salt again.

06:40.830 --> 06:43.580
I don't think you wanna go to jail again.

06:43.580 --> 06:45.593
- Rock salt, my ass!

06:46.800 --> 06:49.193
There's a 12-gauge slug in this gun.

06:50.180 --> 06:54.373
You ever seen what a 12-gauge
slug can do to a squirrel?

06:54.373 --> 06:56.956
(upbeat music)

07:53.653 --> 07:55.570
- Dispatch, I don't know
what's going on here,

07:55.570 --> 07:56.653
but it's a mess.

07:56.653 --> 08:01.653
(suspenseful music)
(electricity sizzling)

08:22.290 --> 08:25.457
(electricity zapping)

08:44.407 --> 08:46.990
- Hey, McNeil, you there? Over.

08:49.488 --> 08:53.155
Hey, McNeil, this is
Dave in Dispatch, copy?

08:54.060 --> 08:55.660
- Copy, Dispatch.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.133
This is McNeil. Go ahead.

08:59.940 --> 09:03.160
- Hey, buddy, looks like
we're getting some reports

09:03.160 --> 09:06.690
of a blown transformer
over there on 5th Street.

09:06.690 --> 09:08.056
You in the area?

09:08.056 --> 09:09.795
- Affirmative.

09:09.795 --> 09:13.293
I'm here and the transformer is out.

09:14.140 --> 09:16.093
It kinda blew up on me.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.153
- Blew up?

09:20.274 --> 09:21.920
What was that, Trace?

09:21.920 --> 09:23.763
Well, say again. I didn't copy that.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.827
- I'm gonna close my eyes for a bit.

09:29.310 --> 09:32.343
- Hey, listen, Trace, I got
emergency crews on the way.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.550
Hang in there, buddy.

09:35.550 --> 09:36.650
I need you to talk to me, though.

09:36.650 --> 09:38.137
Come on. Let me hear you.

09:38.137 --> 09:40.213
- I'm just gonna take a little nap.

09:41.610 --> 09:44.710
- [Dave] Do not close your
eyes on me. Do not fall asleep.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.888
Emergency crews will be there any moment.

09:46.888 --> 09:49.555
(glitchy music)

10:03.580 --> 10:05.080
- Trace.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.313
Trace, wake up.

10:08.860 --> 10:09.810
You've had a shock.

10:10.947 --> 10:12.480
- Am I dead?

10:12.480 --> 10:15.083
- No. You're going to be fine.

10:16.970 --> 10:18.293
- Rose, is that you?

10:19.300 --> 10:20.413
- Of course it is.

10:22.037 --> 10:23.217
I'm here for you.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.558
I'll always be right here.

10:28.551 --> 10:30.730
We're bound together.

10:30.730 --> 10:31.803
- That smell.

10:33.180 --> 10:35.590
You smell so...

10:35.590 --> 10:38.080
- A rose by any other name...

10:38.080 --> 10:39.593
- Would smell as sweet.

10:41.871 --> 10:45.121
(Rose speaks in Latin)

10:53.881 --> 10:54.714
- Rose?

10:59.467 --> 11:02.134
(glitchy music)

11:03.752 --> 11:04.585
Huh.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.925
(upbeat rock music)

11:37.857 --> 11:40.524
(ominous music)

11:47.771 --> 11:50.358
- [Quinn] Hello. Yoo-hoo!

11:50.358 --> 11:51.191
- Come in!

11:56.459 --> 12:00.442
- There's the man with the magic ball.

12:00.442 --> 12:01.275
Hey.

12:03.342 --> 12:04.698
Oh.

12:04.698 --> 12:05.531
Christ.

12:07.890 --> 12:09.973
You look awful. What happened?

12:15.470 --> 12:17.470
- I'm sorry I didn't show up last night.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.870
- I mean, that's an understatement.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.543
You had more gutter balls than hit pins.

12:24.886 --> 12:26.920
- What are you talking about?

12:26.920 --> 12:31.920
- I mean, you went 10
frames and scored an eight.

12:32.110 --> 12:33.613
A goddamn eight.

12:35.650 --> 12:37.513
I didn't even know that was possible.

12:38.380 --> 12:40.010
- But I wasn't there.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.140
- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

12:42.140 --> 12:44.343
You were definitely somewhere else.

12:45.580 --> 12:49.293
- I mean, I physically wasn't there.

12:50.417 --> 12:51.717
- Are you fucking with me?

12:52.920 --> 12:54.793
- I don't know what happened.

12:54.793 --> 12:56.203
I just wasn't there.

12:59.160 --> 13:01.530
- That's disgusting. What is that?

13:04.020 --> 13:05.240
- Spider bite.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.663
- Jesus.

13:06.663 --> 13:09.040
Well, what bit you? A black widow?

13:09.040 --> 13:10.770
- No, I got all these brown house spiders

13:10.770 --> 13:11.710
all over the place.

13:11.710 --> 13:13.830
- Oh! Really?

13:13.830 --> 13:16.930
Dude, that's disgusting. You
need to get an exterminator.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.820
- No, no, no.

13:19.820 --> 13:21.987
I can't kill any of them.
Rose doesn't want me to.

13:21.987 --> 13:23.570
- Oh, oh.

13:23.570 --> 13:27.120
The stripper with the heart of gold

13:28.270 --> 13:31.190
doesn't want you to kill bugs?

13:31.190 --> 13:32.730
I mean, imagine that.

13:32.730 --> 13:34.280
- It's not like that, OK?

13:34.280 --> 13:38.073
- You know what? Let's
just stay on track here.

13:39.810 --> 13:43.023
You really don't remember
anything about last night?

13:45.000 --> 13:45.833
- I...

13:47.660 --> 13:48.493
No.

13:50.170 --> 13:51.003
What happened?

13:52.940 --> 13:53.773
- I bowled

13:54.710 --> 13:57.677
a 264, man.

13:57.677 --> 14:02.460
It was the greatest game of my life.

14:02.460 --> 14:04.253
It was because of you.

14:06.030 --> 14:06.963
- I was there?

14:07.810 --> 14:11.493
- There? I couldn't
have done it otherwise.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.653
You let me touch it.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.033
- Touch what?

14:17.985 --> 14:20.210
- Are you fucking with me, Trace?

14:20.210 --> 14:21.550
- Fucking with you?

14:21.550 --> 14:23.620
The last thing I remember is
getting electrocuted at work

14:23.620 --> 14:25.790
and then waking up on my bed.

14:25.790 --> 14:29.510
- OK, look, you're not making any sense.

14:29.510 --> 14:33.430
But for the record, you
did let me touch it.

14:33.430 --> 14:36.860
- Touch what, Quinn?
What did I let you touch?

14:36.860 --> 14:39.950
- That thing in your bag.

14:39.950 --> 14:41.920
The Electric Rose.

14:41.920 --> 14:45.407
Man, that ball is incredible.

14:45.407 --> 14:48.130
- No, no, don't! Hands off!

14:48.130 --> 14:50.220
I don't remember anything
about last night.

14:50.220 --> 14:51.930
- Well, you owe me 108 bucks.

14:51.930 --> 14:54.740
- I don't know you anything.
You're making shit up now.

14:54.740 --> 14:56.183
- You really don't remember?

15:01.080 --> 15:02.003
- No.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.553
- Oh, I mean, I guess it was weird.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.760
- Please tell me what happened last night.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.560
- Just stop, OK?

15:13.560 --> 15:15.833
Stay still. You're making me nervous.

15:21.140 --> 15:23.373
OK? Just take a deep breath.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.483
You were late, but you showed up.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.700
You were wearing a hospital gown.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.503
Said that you got hurt at
work, but that you were OK.

15:45.310 --> 15:48.823
You weren't wearing any shoes.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.893
Your feet were as filthy as pig shit.

15:58.461 --> 16:00.720
You know, the strangest thing was

16:00.720 --> 16:03.840
you had your bowling ball bag.

16:03.840 --> 16:07.680
So you must have walked
home from the hospital,

16:07.680 --> 16:11.243
grabbed your bag, and then
walked to the bowling alley.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.223
- That is strange.

16:17.590 --> 16:20.560
- Your ass was hanging out, OK?

16:20.560 --> 16:24.070
So I got you a pair of pants
and a shirt at the alley,

16:24.070 --> 16:27.363
I rented your shoes,
and I paid for the game.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.460
- You bought me these?

16:31.460 --> 16:33.520
- Yes, yes.

16:33.520 --> 16:37.420
And that is why you owe me $108.

16:37.420 --> 16:38.770
- I'll get it to you today.

16:39.930 --> 16:40.763
- Thank you.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.123
- I was electrocuted.

16:44.020 --> 16:45.320
- I know.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.003
You couldn't be around
anything metal at the alley.

16:49.330 --> 16:53.140
Your body was filled with electricity.

16:53.140 --> 16:56.280
You fried the pinball machine

16:56.280 --> 16:59.270
and made the lights in our lanes flicker.

16:59.270 --> 17:03.740
You made a poor old man's pacemaker stop.

17:03.740 --> 17:05.793
Your body was fully charged, my friend.

17:15.410 --> 17:16.780
- Seems fine now.

17:16.780 --> 17:21.570
- Good. But I didn't come here
to reminisce about old times.

17:21.570 --> 17:24.413
I need that cash, so can you pay up?

17:31.080 --> 17:33.570
- My phone is dead. Complete brick.

17:33.570 --> 17:37.373
- (scoffs) You must've zapped that, too.

17:38.510 --> 17:40.140
Do you have cash in-

17:40.140 --> 17:41.323
- Hey, give me that.

17:49.207 --> 17:50.660
- Here's 40.

17:50.660 --> 17:52.440
- Well, you're short. Don't fuck me.

17:52.440 --> 17:55.013
- I'll send you the rest as
soon as I get my phone working.

17:57.850 --> 17:59.773
- You could just loan it to me.

18:01.228 --> 18:04.213
Just one day, and we'd be square.

18:05.050 --> 18:06.670
- Loan what?

18:06.670 --> 18:09.165
- Your ball. The Electric Rose.

18:09.165 --> 18:10.810
- No. Nobody touches her.

18:10.810 --> 18:13.950
I can't believe I let you
bowl with her last night.

18:13.950 --> 18:14.783
- I gotta go.

18:17.470 --> 18:22.470
But if I don't have that
cash by the end of my shift,

18:22.780 --> 18:24.010
I'm coming for her.

18:24.010 --> 18:25.210
- You'll get your money.

18:26.530 --> 18:28.060
- I'd rather touch your ball.

18:28.060 --> 18:29.270
- Go!

18:29.270 --> 18:30.807
Leave!

18:30.807 --> 18:32.160
I need to get my head straight.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.263
- Ah, fuck you.

18:34.670 --> 18:35.503
- Thanks.

18:40.465 --> 18:43.215
(brooding music)

19:12.110 --> 19:15.640
- Yesterday's outage left nearly
10,000 people without power

19:15.640 --> 19:17.920
and wreaked havoc throughout the city.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.630
A faulty transformer is believed

19:19.630 --> 19:21.425
to have been the cause of the disturbance.

19:21.425 --> 19:24.092
(ominous music)

20:26.281 --> 20:29.031
(light clicking)

20:45.694 --> 20:48.611
(zombies growling)

21:14.239 --> 21:16.906
(glitchy music)

21:22.047 --> 21:24.797
(brooding music)

21:40.510 --> 21:42.940
- I'm sorry about last night.

21:42.940 --> 21:45.903
Yesterday was a weird day.

21:48.760 --> 21:51.533
- Well, we're here now.
I have made dinner.

21:52.580 --> 21:53.963
- Aren't you having wine?

21:55.390 --> 21:58.163
- No, I have a special cocktail.

22:13.140 --> 22:15.683
- Is that human blood?

22:15.683 --> 22:18.563
- No. I have to go to New
Orleans for the real thing.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.190
- Why New Orleans?

22:21.190 --> 22:22.540
- There are others like me.

22:25.210 --> 22:26.123
- Vampires?

22:29.180 --> 22:32.023
- Sanguinarians. A whole community of us.

22:34.060 --> 22:35.903
- And they drink human blood?

22:37.320 --> 22:40.553
- They have donors. Friendlies.

22:43.850 --> 22:45.963
But this will do for now.

22:50.710 --> 22:51.543
- What is it?

22:56.910 --> 22:57.753
- Animal blood.

23:00.130 --> 23:03.660
- Really? Like a pig?

23:03.660 --> 23:04.493
- Or bovine.

23:05.744 --> 23:06.577
- (chuckles) OK.

23:17.440 --> 23:19.607
Hmm. This is so delicious.

23:22.420 --> 23:24.410
I love my steak rare,

23:24.410 --> 23:27.520
but restaurants usually
won't cook it like this.

23:27.520 --> 23:30.337
You know, they're too damn
worried about food poisoning.

23:31.960 --> 23:33.300
- Well, if you like your steak bloody,

23:33.300 --> 23:36.680
maybe you're secretly one of us.

23:36.680 --> 23:38.810
Here, try it.

23:38.810 --> 23:40.350
- Uh, no,

23:40.350 --> 23:41.893
but thanks.

23:48.280 --> 23:51.602
- This is great. I'm glad
we're able to together.

23:51.602 --> 23:52.870
I'll be dancing the next six nights,

23:52.870 --> 23:54.520
and I won't have a break.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.130
- Wow, busy.

23:56.130 --> 23:58.408
You know, I could come
watch you dance sometime.

23:58.408 --> 24:00.450
(Rose laughs)

24:00.450 --> 24:01.700
- You couldn't afford it.

24:02.620 --> 24:05.643
Anyway, my dancing isn't
exactly your style.

24:10.072 --> 24:11.413
Ew, gross, what the fuck
is that on your hand?

24:11.413 --> 24:14.630
- [Trace] Oh, nothing.
It's just a spider bite.

24:14.630 --> 24:15.793
- A spider bite?

24:16.970 --> 24:18.170
What is going on, Trace?

24:19.920 --> 24:21.360
- I didn't wanna kill any of the spiders

24:21.360 --> 24:22.710
after you said I shouldn't.

24:23.693 --> 24:25.870
- (laughs) Well, I didn't
mean you should keep them

24:25.870 --> 24:28.770
in your fucking house
and let them bite you.

24:28.770 --> 24:30.490
Catch and release, my friend.

24:30.490 --> 24:32.153
- I'm trying. It's not that easy.

24:32.153 --> 24:36.553
There's a infestation under
the floorboards, or something.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.963
- It's karma, little bitch.

24:44.128 --> 24:46.795
(ominous music)

24:48.000 --> 24:49.280
Trace, I have something I wanna tell you.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.530
- Oh. This sounds serious.

24:52.530 --> 24:53.363
- It is.

24:54.470 --> 24:55.913
I wanna move to New Orleans.

24:57.020 --> 24:58.120
- I already know that.

24:59.460 --> 25:01.713
- I am moving to New Orleans.

25:04.950 --> 25:06.633
- Oh, OK, well,

25:07.890 --> 25:09.183
that is big news.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.730
- I've been saving.

25:11.730 --> 25:13.780
The Community of Others are ready for me.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.460
- This is a major life decision, Rose.

25:17.460 --> 25:19.370
- One I'm ready to make.

25:19.370 --> 25:21.983
This paycheck or the next. I'm ready.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.153
- Wow.

25:25.610 --> 25:26.860
I don't know what to say.

25:28.780 --> 25:30.080
- You should come with me.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.628
- I mean, that sounds great,

25:33.628 --> 25:35.850
but I don't know what I'd do for work.

25:35.850 --> 25:37.044
- A meter's a meter.

25:37.044 --> 25:40.174
They have electricity in
New Orleans, too, asshole.

25:40.174 --> 25:41.091
- Maybe so.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.193
- You could be my donor.

25:50.170 --> 25:51.793
- I don't know about that.

25:54.100 --> 25:55.123
- Think about it.

25:56.553 --> 25:58.470
It might not be so bad.

26:06.809 --> 26:09.476
(ominous music)

26:20.510 --> 26:23.177
(glitchy music)

26:41.300 --> 26:43.170
- What's happening to me.

26:43.170 --> 26:46.880
- There is nothing to
eat in this refrigerator.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.593
You need to go to the store, man.

26:50.530 --> 26:52.180
- Yeah, it's been a few days.

26:52.180 --> 26:54.283
- Oh, thanks for the money, by the way.

26:55.580 --> 26:57.210
- I pay what's owed.

26:57.210 --> 27:00.730
- But you didn't owe me anything.

27:00.730 --> 27:03.410
- What about last night
at the bowling alley?

27:03.410 --> 27:05.110
- We didn't go bowling last night.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.400
- You didn't buy me clothes at the alley?

27:09.400 --> 27:12.593
- No, man. I didn't
even see you last night.

27:14.550 --> 27:15.700
- Must've been a dream.

27:17.390 --> 27:18.653
It was so visceral.

27:19.930 --> 27:23.253
- Hospital-grade morphine. Very powerful.

27:24.750 --> 27:26.600
- We really didn't go bowling?

27:26.600 --> 27:28.230
- No.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.440
- [Trace] You didn't buy me clothes?

27:30.440 --> 27:31.490
- No.

27:31.490 --> 27:33.540
- I didn't let you use the Electric Rose?

27:34.750 --> 27:38.100
- I think you'd sooner let me
fondle the balls in your sack

27:38.100 --> 27:40.063
before that ball in your bag.

27:43.910 --> 27:45.393
- My mind is a mess.

27:47.540 --> 27:50.113
- Well, you did get electrocuted.

27:53.510 --> 27:56.313
How powerful was that
transformer that shocked you?

28:01.732 --> 28:03.482
- About 12,000 volts.

28:04.670 --> 28:06.120
- That sounds like a lot.

28:06.120 --> 28:09.483
- It is. 50 volts is enough to kill you.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.443
- Shouldn't you be dead?

28:13.890 --> 28:14.823
- I was.

28:16.765 --> 28:18.423
- Whoa. No shit.

28:19.390 --> 28:22.260
- Doctor said the initial shock killed me

28:22.260 --> 28:24.820
and the secondary shock
restarted my heart.

28:24.820 --> 28:27.393
- What the fuck, man.

28:28.430 --> 28:31.093
You have transcended, my brother.

28:32.190 --> 28:33.903
You've been to the other side.

28:35.920 --> 28:39.940
You're like that '80s rocker.
The guy from Def Leppard.

28:39.940 --> 28:41.000
- Rick Allen?

28:41.000 --> 28:44.330
- [Quinn] I knew you'd know
who I was talking about.

28:44.330 --> 28:47.050
- Rick Allen lost an
arm. He didn't die, dude.

28:47.050 --> 28:49.093
- [Quinn] No, no, no. The other guy.

28:50.190 --> 28:52.900
- You mean Motley Crue, not Def Leppard.

28:52.900 --> 28:55.873
- No, no, no, that's the
drummer with the big dick.

28:57.050 --> 28:58.780
- Tommy Lee?
- Yeah.

28:58.780 --> 29:03.140
He's not dead. He's
just got a big schlong.

29:03.140 --> 29:05.003
- It was Nikki Sixx.

29:06.288 --> 29:07.670
- But who's that?

29:07.670 --> 29:09.480
- The bass player for Motley Crue,

29:09.480 --> 29:11.810
Nikki Sixx, overdosed on heroin.

29:11.810 --> 29:13.870
He was declared dead.

29:13.870 --> 29:16.090
- I don't know about that.

29:16.090 --> 29:18.990
- Two shots of adrenaline
brought him back to life.

29:18.990 --> 29:20.140
- [Quinn] Are you sure?

29:21.450 --> 29:23.100
- He wrote a song about it, dude.

29:24.720 --> 29:27.070
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember that song.

29:27.070 --> 29:28.423
That's the guy.

29:29.470 --> 29:30.303
Man.

29:31.180 --> 29:33.120
Electricity was your heroin,

29:33.120 --> 29:37.513
and adrenaline killed
you and brought you back.

29:39.550 --> 29:40.603
What was it like?

29:42.400 --> 29:43.873
Did you see a tunnel?

29:45.210 --> 29:47.723
Dead relatives? A white light?

29:49.930 --> 29:50.763
- I don't know.

29:52.570 --> 29:54.423
Just lots of colors.

29:55.470 --> 29:57.423
Colorful, flashing lights.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.760
(glitchy music)

30:03.760 --> 30:04.593
- You OK?

30:05.710 --> 30:07.900
- Yeah, yeah. I keep getting flashes.

30:07.900 --> 30:08.852
- Just...

30:08.852 --> 30:09.685
(electricity zapping)

30:09.685 --> 30:10.600
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?

30:10.600 --> 30:15.026
- You're electric. I can feel
the static coming from you.

30:15.026 --> 30:18.460
(electricity zapping)
(upbeat rock music)

30:18.460 --> 30:20.373
Whoa. Did you do that?

30:21.890 --> 30:24.510
- I don't know, but it keeps happening.

30:24.510 --> 30:26.390
- Can you make it happen?

30:26.390 --> 30:30.530
Can you control it like
a freaking superhero?

30:30.530 --> 30:32.190
- What do you mean?

30:32.190 --> 30:33.733
- Just try the hand thing.

30:36.198 --> 30:39.958
(electricity zapping)

30:39.958 --> 30:41.625
- You feel anything?

30:42.817 --> 30:45.984
(electricity zapping)

30:49.523 --> 30:51.100
- I can't.

30:51.100 --> 30:53.070
- Well, you know what?

30:53.070 --> 30:55.606
Just keep at it.

30:55.606 --> 30:58.613
You know, you need to harness that shit.

31:02.150 --> 31:03.973
You want some of this?

31:05.590 --> 31:07.020
- Since when do you get high?

31:07.020 --> 31:09.220
What happened to healthy
body, healthy mind?

31:11.480 --> 31:14.010
- You are not normal, my friend.

31:14.010 --> 31:16.753
I've been getting high since I was 15.

31:18.326 --> 31:19.376
- I didn't know that.

31:22.290 --> 31:25.560
- Dude, that out-of-body
experience of yours

31:25.560 --> 31:29.533
must've triggered like some
early-onset Alzheimer's.

31:31.380 --> 31:33.063
You've been getting high with me.

31:38.030 --> 31:42.762
- Good God.

31:42.762 --> 31:43.595
Good God.

31:46.529 --> 31:48.086
(Trace moans)

31:48.086 --> 31:51.253
(electricity zapping)

31:56.125 --> 31:58.792
(glitchy music)

32:07.019 --> 32:09.936
(people screaming)

32:17.719 --> 32:20.469
(tranquil music)

32:40.978 --> 32:41.928
- Hey.

32:41.928 --> 32:42.761
Hey, kid

32:43.674 --> 32:44.507
Kid.

32:45.786 --> 32:47.300
- Yes, sir?

32:47.300 --> 32:48.840
- I ain't no goddamn sir.

32:48.840 --> 32:51.183
Don't think I've ever been
called sir in my life.

32:52.330 --> 32:55.430
- I don't remember the last
time anyone called me kid,

32:55.430 --> 32:57.790
so I guess that makes us pretty much even.

32:57.790 --> 33:00.040
- Even, my ass. That'd make you my equal.

33:00.040 --> 33:01.333
You ain't my equal, kid.

33:03.280 --> 33:06.103
- I suppose I never will be, sir.

33:08.749 --> 33:10.130
Are we just trading insults here

33:10.130 --> 33:12.683
or did you have something
you wanted to say?

33:14.060 --> 33:14.993
- Can I sit?

33:16.260 --> 33:17.093
- Sure.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.300
- Buy a guy a cup of coffee?

33:25.450 --> 33:26.920
- Have some peanuts.

33:26.920 --> 33:29.173
- I will. I love these peanuts.

33:30.950 --> 33:32.093
I know what you did.

33:33.610 --> 33:34.710
- You know what I did?

33:35.690 --> 33:37.540
- Yeah, I do. I've been watching you.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.090
- Is that so?

33:40.090 --> 33:40.923
- It is.

33:41.810 --> 33:45.520
- Then fill me in because my
mind is kind of a blank lately.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.180
- How do know you're not
some weirdo serial killer

33:48.180 --> 33:50.213
who wants to drug and rape and kill me?

33:51.430 --> 33:53.200
- You're not my type.

33:53.200 --> 33:56.280
- I'm not? What kinda rapist are you?

33:56.280 --> 33:57.460
- I'm not.

33:57.460 --> 33:58.463
- Serial killer?

33:59.560 --> 34:02.560
- No. You know, you invite
yourself to sit down.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.470
You can leave any time.

34:04.470 --> 34:07.140
- Oh, so you're just a weirdo, then.

34:07.140 --> 34:07.973
- You got me.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.540
- I know your type.

34:11.540 --> 34:12.373
- Enlighten me.

34:13.410 --> 34:15.660
- I already told you.
I've been watching you.

34:17.300 --> 34:18.830
- Who's the weirdo?

34:18.830 --> 34:20.890
- I don't know. Who's the rapist?

34:20.890 --> 34:22.270
- I'm not a rapist.

34:22.270 --> 34:23.890
- Serial killer?

34:23.890 --> 34:26.003
- Nice talk. I'm leaving.

34:27.110 --> 34:27.943
- Hey, hey.

34:29.730 --> 34:31.540
I know it was you that left a sandwich.

34:31.540 --> 34:35.040
Left it on the bench next
to me while I was sleeping.

34:35.040 --> 34:35.877
Thank you.

34:38.385 --> 34:40.950
- It was a burger, not a sandwich.

34:40.950 --> 34:42.853
- It was delicious. Thank you.

34:43.750 --> 34:44.600
- You're welcome.

34:45.990 --> 34:47.540
See, if I was a serial killer,

34:47.540 --> 34:50.350
it would've been poisoned
and you'd be dead.

34:50.350 --> 34:52.690
- Now, I'm not your type anyway.

34:52.690 --> 34:53.703
- Definitely not.

34:55.430 --> 34:56.533
I help where I can.

34:58.130 --> 34:59.603
Must be tough being homeless.

35:00.560 --> 35:03.240
- I'm not homeless. I'm a transient.

35:03.240 --> 35:05.003
I live my life in transition.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.930
What do you got for me today?

35:09.050 --> 35:10.790
- OK. That's the way it is now, huh?

35:10.790 --> 35:14.470
- Oh, you entitled, selfish
prick. I know you got something.

35:14.470 --> 35:17.310
- I don't, actually. Not today.

35:17.310 --> 35:19.793
- What about that? What's in the bag.

35:21.260 --> 35:23.213
- That's my Electric Rose.

35:23.213 --> 35:25.153
- What the hell's an elect'ic rose?

35:26.050 --> 35:27.700
- It's my bowling ball.

35:27.700 --> 35:29.570
- Let me have it.
- No!

35:29.570 --> 35:30.900
- Let me look at it, then.

35:30.900 --> 35:32.340
- No.

35:32.340 --> 35:34.190
- What are you hiding in
there? At least let me look.

35:34.190 --> 35:37.410
- No. Stay there, stay back.

35:37.410 --> 35:38.990
- But I'm starving.

35:38.990 --> 35:40.350
- Starving?

35:40.350 --> 35:42.643
Can't eat a bowling ball. Here.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.700
Time for me to go.

35:50.700 --> 35:51.623
- Fuck you.

35:53.127 --> 35:54.793
- You're a mean one, aren't you?

35:57.820 --> 35:59.210
- Hey, look at me, you fucker.

35:59.210 --> 36:01.150
- Nope. I know what you're doing.

36:01.150 --> 36:02.310
- I'm waving goodbye.

36:02.310 --> 36:03.400
- No, you're not.

36:03.400 --> 36:04.730
- Just look.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.467
- I don't need to see that. Bye.

36:07.366 --> 36:08.544
(man laughing)

36:08.544 --> 36:11.211
(ominous music)

36:13.601 --> 36:16.518
(zombies growling)

36:35.747 --> 36:38.247
(Trace gasps)

36:41.188 --> 36:43.771
(Trace groans)

37:06.164 --> 37:07.384
- Hey, boyo, boyo.

37:07.384 --> 37:09.850
(whistles) Come on, come back, come back.

37:09.850 --> 37:12.560
Hey, come on now.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.970
Look at you.

37:14.970 --> 37:17.340
You're back in the real world.

37:17.340 --> 37:18.183
- Dad?

37:19.250 --> 37:22.887
- You know, I thought I'd lost you there,

37:22.887 --> 37:26.460
as you're sitting there staring
with that glassy-eyed stare

37:26.460 --> 37:30.890
like you'd just seen
some buxom blonde angel

37:32.150 --> 37:33.000
over my shoulder.

37:34.550 --> 37:36.053
- Not exactly.

37:37.710 --> 37:39.770
What are you doing here?

37:39.770 --> 37:43.010
- Haven't you heard one
thing that I've said?

37:43.010 --> 37:44.190
- I, uh...

37:46.020 --> 37:47.220
You're dead.

37:47.220 --> 37:49.530
- Now, now, son, son, come on.

37:49.530 --> 37:51.200
I mean, I know our relationship

37:51.200 --> 37:54.410
hasn't been wine and roses all the time,

37:54.410 --> 37:56.700
but I was thinking that maybe now

37:56.700 --> 38:00.520
it was getting better since Mum passed.

38:00.520 --> 38:01.690
- Mom's dead?

38:01.690 --> 38:04.670
- Oh for God's sake. What
the fuck are you, a moron?

38:04.670 --> 38:07.580
I mean, did you get concussion as well?

38:07.580 --> 38:10.870
That accident, what, did
you burn out your memory,

38:10.870 --> 38:12.353
shit everything to hell?

38:14.966 --> 38:16.370
(electricity zaps)
- Oh! Ow!

38:16.370 --> 38:17.373
- Are you here?

38:18.690 --> 38:20.539
Are you with me?
- What?

38:20.539 --> 38:21.883
(electricity zaps)
Ow!

38:21.883 --> 38:23.830
Christ, stop hitting me!

38:23.830 --> 38:25.980
- Stop being an asshole.

38:25.980 --> 38:27.830
- Look, I didn't do anything.

38:27.830 --> 38:30.660
- You zapped me.

38:30.660 --> 38:32.320
- Yeah, when you slapped me.

38:32.320 --> 38:35.823
- Yeah, I can feel the
electricity coming off your body.

38:38.790 --> 38:41.190
You think you really
should be going work today?

38:42.450 --> 38:45.593
- Probably not, but I
have to do something.

38:47.620 --> 38:48.453
- Tell me, boyo.

38:50.610 --> 38:51.573
Did you, um,

38:53.950 --> 38:54.853
really die?

39:00.570 --> 39:01.403
- I, uh,

39:05.600 --> 39:06.523
guess I did.

39:08.620 --> 39:11.810
- Well, do you think that it's really safe

39:11.810 --> 39:12.993
to be driving, then?

39:14.440 --> 39:15.283
- I'm not sure.

39:20.260 --> 39:22.699
(both yelling)
(electricity zapping)

39:22.699 --> 39:23.532
- Damn!

39:24.558 --> 39:28.057
Shit, that was like 110 volts.

39:28.057 --> 39:29.900
- It's just static.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.998
- I can feel it. I can feel it.

39:31.998 --> 39:32.831
You know,

39:34.260 --> 39:35.633
the closer I get,

39:38.690 --> 39:39.923
the larger,

39:41.066 --> 39:42.943
the bigger the surge.

39:44.610 --> 39:49.610
(electricity zapping)
(both yelling)

39:54.708 --> 39:56.485
Look, do you, do you,

39:56.485 --> 39:57.888
do you control that?

39:57.888 --> 39:58.721
- No.
- Ah.

40:00.410 --> 40:03.060
I think you need a lawyer.
This is a huge lawsuit.

40:03.060 --> 40:07.210
- No, no, no, no. I need to be normal.

40:07.210 --> 40:08.200
That's what I need.

40:08.200 --> 40:12.790
- You ain't never gonna be normal, boyo.

40:12.790 --> 40:16.470
But this accident, oh,
this accident. (laughs)

40:16.470 --> 40:20.123
We are gonna be rich, my son, rich.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.420
- Well, I don't want that.

40:23.261 --> 40:27.240
- You know, we got to document this.

40:27.240 --> 40:28.513
Keep a record.

40:33.530 --> 40:36.490
My phone doesn't work.

40:36.490 --> 40:40.473
That is definitely more
than static electricity.

40:41.580 --> 40:45.730
You, my boy, owe me a new bone.

40:45.730 --> 40:47.110
- Hey, you touched me.

40:47.110 --> 40:50.950
- I don't give a fuck!
You fucked up my phone!

40:50.950 --> 40:54.040
(ominous music)

40:54.040 --> 40:56.140
- Hey, why are you giving me the evil eye?

40:57.090 --> 41:00.573
- The devil is in this house.

41:02.420 --> 41:03.963
- Dad, Dad,

41:04.970 --> 41:06.343
I don't understand.

41:08.170 --> 41:12.640
- Your mother would want
you to go to church.

41:12.640 --> 41:14.537
That's what she'd want you to do.

41:14.537 --> 41:16.423
- (scoffs) Church?

41:18.220 --> 41:19.173
Which one?

41:20.020 --> 41:22.960
- Your mother would want you
to go to a Catholic church?

41:22.960 --> 41:24.690
You know, likes St. John's,

41:24.690 --> 41:27.620
oh, I don't know what his bloody is.

41:27.620 --> 41:29.373
The one that's next to the house.

41:30.850 --> 41:34.120
- There's a Lutheran church near here.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.390
- Oh, for God's sake, who cares?

41:35.390 --> 41:36.910
I don't think that Jesus

41:36.910 --> 41:39.023
gives a fuck about the denomination.

41:41.760 --> 41:46.080
The devil is in the detail.

41:46.080 --> 41:47.180
- What does that mean?

41:49.860 --> 41:50.913
- When you, uh,

41:52.650 --> 41:55.533
figure this shit out, give me a call.

42:02.950 --> 42:04.123
- But you're dead.

42:06.434 --> 42:09.017
(upbeat music)

42:29.900 --> 42:32.220
Hey, Rose. Rose, let me in.

42:32.220 --> 42:33.220
Come on, I wanna talk.

42:33.220 --> 42:36.033
- Oh, shut the fuck up! Give me a minute!

42:38.820 --> 42:40.590
- Rose, you there?

42:40.590 --> 42:41.423
Rose!

42:43.249 --> 42:44.082
- It's too early for this.
- Come on, let me in.

42:44.082 --> 42:45.013
I wanna hang out.

42:57.670 --> 42:58.503
Can I come in?

43:01.040 --> 43:01.873
- Yeah.

43:04.780 --> 43:06.140
Tea?

43:06.140 --> 43:06.973
- Please.

43:08.440 --> 43:09.490
- How do you take it?

43:10.340 --> 43:12.953
- Uh, no cream, no sugar.

43:13.890 --> 43:15.310
No blood.

43:15.310 --> 43:16.820
- You look dressed for work.

43:16.820 --> 43:18.654
I thought you were taking a few days off.

43:18.654 --> 43:20.323
- I was. I am.

43:23.336 --> 43:25.980
- That is from "Giselle."

43:25.980 --> 43:27.073
I was the lead.

43:28.316 --> 43:30.650
- [Trace] Hmm. Do you miss it?

43:30.650 --> 43:33.493
- Miss it? Why would I
miss something I still do?

43:36.100 --> 43:38.203
- You still ballet dance?

43:39.140 --> 43:39.973
- Huh.

43:41.410 --> 43:42.243
Dancer.

43:45.580 --> 43:47.470
I never said ballet dancer.

43:47.470 --> 43:48.623
- Oh, uh,

43:49.500 --> 43:51.050
yeah, I know.

43:51.050 --> 43:51.883
Right.

43:57.380 --> 43:58.880
- Do you think I'm a stripper?

43:59.871 --> 44:01.480
- Uh, no.

44:01.480 --> 44:02.560
No.

44:02.560 --> 44:03.393
- Trace.

44:06.940 --> 44:09.922
- A dancer in LA. Yes, I
thought you were a stripper.

44:09.922 --> 44:11.233
- You misogynistic shithead!

44:12.564 --> 44:13.564
- [Trace] I'm sorry.

44:17.938 --> 44:19.410
- Well?

44:19.410 --> 44:20.610
- Well, what?

44:20.610 --> 44:22.412
(kettle whistling)

44:22.412 --> 44:25.662
(soft, brooding music)

44:32.055 --> 44:34.222
- What do you want, Trace?

44:37.240 --> 44:41.170
You have never come by
without letting me know first.

44:41.170 --> 44:43.350
You've never pounded on my door like that.

44:43.350 --> 44:46.400
You're acting like some kind
of deranged ex-boyfriend.

44:46.400 --> 44:48.950
- I'm off-kilter and
out of sync right now.

44:48.950 --> 44:49.933
- That's obvious.

44:51.650 --> 44:53.250
- But I had a moment of clarity.

44:54.730 --> 44:55.563
A vision.

44:58.420 --> 44:59.253
- And?

45:00.920 --> 45:02.870
- I wanna move to New Orleans with you.

45:05.570 --> 45:06.900
- That is a vision.

45:06.900 --> 45:08.100
- I could be your donor.

45:14.660 --> 45:16.780
- These are big steps.

45:16.780 --> 45:19.553
- Steps I'm ready to take, Rose.

45:24.850 --> 45:26.033
Take my blood.

45:31.670 --> 45:33.083
- I appreciate this, Trace.

45:34.391 --> 45:35.224
I really do.

45:36.437 --> 45:38.503
It would be a great sacrifice.

45:40.700 --> 45:42.513
- A sacrifice I'm willing to make.

45:44.120 --> 45:45.153
- I'm not sure I am.

45:46.640 --> 45:47.473
Not yet.

45:52.730 --> 45:53.680
- What do you mean?

45:54.660 --> 45:56.220
I thought you were moving to New Orleans

45:56.220 --> 45:58.520
to be with the Community of Others,

45:58.520 --> 46:02.670
to have a donor, to be
part of something unique.

46:02.670 --> 46:04.143
- I am prepared to do that.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.750
Not sure I'm ready for human blood.

46:08.660 --> 46:11.617
- You're ready, Rose. We both are.

46:18.782 --> 46:21.233
- OK, you don't just bite
people and drink their blood.

46:23.020 --> 46:24.067
- You don't?

46:24.067 --> 46:24.900
- No.

46:26.330 --> 46:27.253
There's a ritual.

46:29.173 --> 46:30.006
A ceremony.

46:30.980 --> 46:34.520
And then blood is extracted
to avoid infections.

46:34.520 --> 46:37.263
- This is much more
complicated than I realized.

46:38.790 --> 46:41.263
- Being my donor is not a one-time event.

46:42.310 --> 46:45.693
It's a commitment, like marriage.

46:46.960 --> 46:48.820
- I can commit, Rose.

46:48.820 --> 46:50.773
- It's not necessarily physical.

46:52.560 --> 46:53.960
- Not necessarily?

46:53.960 --> 46:56.290
- It wouldn't make us lovers.

46:56.290 --> 46:57.793
- Oh, I know, I know.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.767
- We would be bound to one another

47:03.840 --> 47:04.693
for life.

47:05.700 --> 47:06.700
- I can handle that.

47:08.350 --> 47:10.450
- It is a commitment to serve one another.

47:12.440 --> 47:13.623
It is mutual.

47:15.760 --> 47:17.053
- How would you, uh,

47:18.870 --> 47:19.703
serve me?

47:21.907 --> 47:26.686
- Well, I'm sure we can come
up with something that is

47:26.686 --> 47:28.269
mutually agreeable.

47:34.870 --> 47:37.510
- What's this process,

47:37.510 --> 47:40.590
this ritual?

47:40.590 --> 47:43.193
- I need to do a little research first.

47:45.150 --> 47:46.473
- I hope we don't have to,

47:47.977 --> 47:50.421
you know, kill a chicken, or anything?

47:50.421 --> 47:51.750
- No.

47:51.750 --> 47:53.680
No, no.

47:53.680 --> 47:55.363
Well, not a chicken.

47:56.450 --> 47:58.050
- But we have to kill something?

48:00.680 --> 48:02.920
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

48:02.920 --> 48:04.163
What do we have to kill?

48:05.370 --> 48:07.840
- Maybe a pig or a cow?

48:07.840 --> 48:10.930
But maybe not. There
might be way around that.

48:10.930 --> 48:11.873
- I hope so.

48:15.490 --> 48:16.497
What happens next?

48:16.497 --> 48:18.430
(ominous music)

48:18.430 --> 48:20.803
- Well, we have a fire.

48:21.754 --> 48:23.450
Do a little dancing.

48:23.450 --> 48:25.857
Maybe some chanting.

48:25.857 --> 48:27.807
And I read from the Book of the Others.

48:29.910 --> 48:30.753
- And?

48:33.570 --> 48:34.403
- And?

48:35.460 --> 48:37.300
- I mean, what do you do to me?

48:37.300 --> 48:38.183
Is it gonna hurt?

48:43.470 --> 48:45.593
- I take a ceremonial blade,

48:49.710 --> 48:51.103
cut your hand,

48:52.500 --> 48:54.800
squeeze a little blood
into the fire, and then

48:57.560 --> 48:59.590
drink from the open wound.

49:01.495 --> 49:02.703
- It's gonna hurt a lot.

49:04.100 --> 49:04.990
Can I be drunk?

49:04.990 --> 49:07.180
- No, no alcohol.

49:07.180 --> 49:09.700
- Huh. That's too bad.

49:09.700 --> 49:11.913
- But maybe we can eat some mushrooms.

49:12.790 --> 49:14.840
- Oh, OK.

49:14.840 --> 49:16.690
That works.

49:16.690 --> 49:21.113
Maybe smoke up a pig,
like a real Hawaiian Luau?

49:22.700 --> 49:23.593
Is that it?

49:25.110 --> 49:25.943
Then we're done?

49:28.750 --> 49:30.470
No, there's something more?

49:30.470 --> 49:31.520
OK, what is it?

49:31.520 --> 49:33.263
- Well, the bond will be complete,

49:34.270 --> 49:36.070
but there is one more optional step,

49:37.710 --> 49:39.783
one that will bind us for life.

49:40.920 --> 49:43.513
- Whatever it takes, Rose, I'll accept it.

49:44.540 --> 49:48.003
If I need to kill a chicken,
I'll kill a chicken.

49:51.920 --> 49:53.567
- We need to make love.

49:55.341 --> 49:56.618
- What?

49:56.618 --> 49:58.421
(ominous music)

49:58.421 --> 50:02.843
But I thought you said
we wouldn't be lovers.

50:04.384 --> 50:07.340
- The ritual must be all consuming.

50:07.340 --> 50:10.233
Emotionally, spiritually,

50:11.380 --> 50:14.213
chemically, and physically.

50:17.380 --> 50:19.083
It would just be this once.

50:21.610 --> 50:22.633
- I'm OK with that.

50:23.800 --> 50:24.633
- Forever.

50:26.010 --> 50:26.843
- Works for me.

50:29.399 --> 50:31.394
- I will bleed you.

50:31.394 --> 50:32.644
I will need you

50:33.716 --> 50:34.549
for life.

50:35.874 --> 50:37.457
- My life is yours.

50:38.677 --> 50:41.012
- I can accept that.

50:41.012 --> 50:41.845
- Me too.

50:55.579 --> 50:58.246
(glitchy music)

51:02.679 --> 51:05.429
(brooding music)

51:11.917 --> 51:14.943
- Trace, you there? Let me
guess, we lost you again?

51:20.410 --> 51:23.083
- I was someplace else for a moment.

51:24.180 --> 51:26.180
- Who were you with? Anyone interesting?

51:27.450 --> 51:29.630
- The devil, I think.

51:29.630 --> 51:32.200
- Why are people always
talking about the devil?

51:32.200 --> 51:33.440
What is it about this gift

51:33.440 --> 51:36.813
that brings out the assholes in the world?

51:36.813 --> 51:38.463
- Next it'll be Jesus.

51:41.280 --> 51:42.780
- How did this start with you?

51:44.054 --> 51:47.363
- I went out for a walk.
Went under a streetlight.

51:48.580 --> 51:51.973
I could feel the light
warm my entire body.

51:53.330 --> 51:56.560
Then I was somewhere else.

51:56.560 --> 51:57.850
Life's never be the same.

51:57.850 --> 52:00.970
- It was after a car accident for me.

52:00.970 --> 52:04.500
- Start? No, that's
funny, that's a good one.

52:04.500 --> 52:08.900
Now, see, I have been
SLIding my entire life.

52:08.900 --> 52:12.500
I actually vividly recall SLIding

52:12.500 --> 52:15.520
from still inside the womb, OK?

52:15.520 --> 52:17.370
That's how long I've been doing this.

52:18.700 --> 52:20.400
I'm gonna tell you this right now,

52:20.400 --> 52:23.563
and I'm gonna tell you this one time.

52:24.570 --> 52:26.273
If you find a way out,

52:27.420 --> 52:29.690
you better let us know.

52:29.690 --> 52:30.733
And if not,

52:31.650 --> 52:33.550
I swear to God,

52:33.550 --> 52:36.447
I will find you.

52:37.464 --> 52:38.338
OK?

52:38.338 --> 52:41.005
(glitchy music)

52:44.237 --> 52:47.237
(upbeat rock music)

53:01.452 --> 53:04.050
(pins clattering)

53:04.050 --> 53:06.050
- Yeah! Woo-hoo, strike!

53:31.750 --> 53:32.883
- What's up your butt?

53:34.870 --> 53:38.623
- It's Rose. She hasn't
returned any of my messages.

53:39.840 --> 53:42.800
- The woman who thinks she's a vampire?

53:42.800 --> 53:44.810
The one who wants to drink your blood

53:44.810 --> 53:47.000
and cut you with a knife?

53:47.000 --> 53:49.393
She isn't returning
your messages. That one?

53:50.530 --> 53:51.730
- I'm worried about her.

53:52.660 --> 53:53.730
- [Quinn] The stripper?

53:53.730 --> 53:54.563
- Dancer.

53:55.600 --> 53:57.740
- Dancer? That one?

53:57.740 --> 53:58.863
- Yeah, that one.

54:11.900 --> 54:13.733
- Not bad. Almost cracked 200.

54:14.600 --> 54:17.060
- Nice game. Another?

54:17.060 --> 54:17.893
- Sure.

54:21.730 --> 54:22.980
Let me ask you something.

54:24.140 --> 54:27.810
- Uh-oh. I feel judgment coming.

54:27.810 --> 54:28.967
- Maybe a little.

54:30.379 --> 54:31.683
Are you a stalker?

54:33.010 --> 54:33.843
- What?

54:35.060 --> 54:35.943
What do you mean?

54:37.040 --> 54:37.873
No.

54:37.873 --> 54:39.840
- Are you stalking a stripper?

54:39.840 --> 54:42.820
- No, of course not.

54:42.820 --> 54:43.790
- Are you sure about that?

54:43.790 --> 54:44.640
- Yeah, I'm sure.

54:47.280 --> 54:51.653
- New Orleans, blood
rituals, animal sacrifices.

54:52.740 --> 54:54.980
Just sounds to me like
you're stalking her.

54:54.980 --> 54:56.103
- It's not like that.

54:57.020 --> 54:58.860
- Well, then how is it?

54:58.860 --> 55:00.340
I've never met her,

55:00.340 --> 55:02.030
and she's not returning
any of your messages.

55:02.030 --> 55:03.520
- You've met Rose many times.

55:03.520 --> 55:04.670
- No, I haven't.

55:04.670 --> 55:05.803
- We've all hung out.

55:09.640 --> 55:14.440
- This accident of yours,
this electrocution,

55:14.440 --> 55:16.983
has caused some serious damage, my friend.

55:20.550 --> 55:21.713
- I won't argue that.

55:25.930 --> 55:27.930
I don't think I wanna play another game.

55:29.980 --> 55:30.813
- Fine.

55:35.210 --> 55:37.900
Are you gonna put your ball in your bag?

55:37.900 --> 55:39.343
- No, my bag's dirty.

55:43.340 --> 55:45.650
- You're getting weirder and weirder.

55:45.650 --> 55:48.253
You're sliding between worlds, man.

55:50.800 --> 55:51.900
- What does that mean?

55:54.020 --> 55:55.320
- I've been on the Google,

55:56.177 --> 55:57.927
and I know what's happening to you.

56:00.340 --> 56:01.627
- I'm not up for this now.

56:01.627 --> 56:03.330
- No, we need to have this conversation.

56:03.330 --> 56:05.100
If not now, soon.

56:05.100 --> 56:05.933
OK?

56:06.820 --> 56:07.653
- Fine.

56:14.230 --> 56:16.400
- And put your ball in your bag!

56:16.400 --> 56:17.233
- No!

56:19.280 --> 56:20.113
- Oh boy.

56:20.113 --> 56:22.686
(ominous music)

56:25.510 --> 56:26.760
- You got nothing for me?

56:30.659 --> 56:33.326
(glitchy music)

56:50.094 --> 56:55.094
(fire crackling)
(bird tweeting)

56:56.190 --> 56:59.023
(chimes tinkling)

57:03.069 --> 57:05.090
It's really warm under here.

57:05.090 --> 57:06.580
- It's part of the ritual.

57:06.580 --> 57:08.090
- Do I have to wear it the entire time?

57:08.090 --> 57:10.600
- Unless you wanna kill a live pig.

57:10.600 --> 57:11.433
- Fine.

57:17.658 --> 57:20.908
(Rose speaks in Latin)

57:30.780 --> 57:33.223
- Hold it here. This might hurt.

57:34.760 --> 57:35.593
- I'm ready.

57:36.634 --> 57:39.884
(Rose speaks in Latin)

58:06.000 --> 58:08.583
(Trace winces)

58:13.723 --> 58:15.530
- Hold it there.

58:15.530 --> 58:16.613
Let it bleed.

58:52.453 --> 58:55.703
(Rose speaks in Latin)

59:00.440 --> 59:02.980
Now we complete the ritual.

59:07.907 --> 59:10.574
(glitchy music)

59:14.771 --> 59:19.771
(ominous music)
(zombies growling)

1:00:43.918 --> 1:00:47.168
(soft, brooding music)

1:00:50.376 --> 1:00:51.709
- Man, sometimes

1:00:53.015 --> 1:00:53.848
this stuff

1:00:55.053 --> 1:00:56.193
just won't come off.

1:01:04.145 --> 1:01:06.395
Hey, you startled me. Shit.

1:01:08.951 --> 1:01:10.051
You're not the pastor.

1:01:11.470 --> 1:01:13.663
- No, definitely not me.

1:01:15.113 --> 1:01:18.280
- You see Dermudy? He just
walked through this way.

1:01:18.280 --> 1:01:19.270
- Who?

1:01:19.270 --> 1:01:20.120
- Father Dermudy.

1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:25.650
This is a church. He's
the pastor for the parish.

1:01:25.650 --> 1:01:27.360
You didn't see him walk by here?

1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:29.823
- No, I haven't seen anyone. Just you.

1:01:31.210 --> 1:01:32.363
- Just me, really?

1:01:33.290 --> 1:01:34.790
Nobody notices me. Huh.

1:01:38.270 --> 1:01:39.670
How'd you get in here?

1:01:39.670 --> 1:01:42.730
Come on, man, the door's locked.

1:01:42.730 --> 1:01:45.853
- I, uh, walked in, I guess.

1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:49.850
- So what brings you here?

1:01:49.850 --> 1:01:53.033
Redemption or a good time?

1:01:55.290 --> 1:01:56.553
- What do you mean?

1:01:57.410 --> 1:01:58.746
- [Handyman] Well, if you watch the news,

1:01:58.746 --> 1:02:00.510
you'd think these places
are nothing but a big party

1:02:00.510 --> 1:02:02.583
pushing out wafers and wine.

1:02:03.420 --> 1:02:05.070
- No, I'm not here for good time.

1:02:06.060 --> 1:02:07.123
- Redemption, then?

1:02:07.123 --> 1:02:09.913
- No, no. I'm just here.

1:02:12.524 --> 1:02:13.357
- OK.

1:02:14.927 --> 1:02:17.940
Well, the confessional's
closed. Black mold.

1:02:17.940 --> 1:02:20.453
And services are on
hold. The wine went sour.

1:02:22.260 --> 1:02:23.093
- Hard luck.

1:02:24.900 --> 1:02:26.390
- Catholic?

1:02:26.390 --> 1:02:27.533
- [Trace] Not a good one.

1:02:29.484 --> 1:02:31.084
- I'm not sure there is anymore.

1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:38.293
- Dark days, my friend.

1:02:39.140 --> 1:02:40.120
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:41.680
I wouldn't walk up on that sanctuary.

1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:42.840
- [Trace] I know the rules. I won't.

1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:45.520
- I'm not talking about rules, asshole.

1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:48.170
Floorboards. They're rotten.

1:02:48.170 --> 1:02:50.720
And it won't be safe until I replace them.

1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:51.840
- Sounds like a lot of work.

1:02:51.840 --> 1:02:52.673
- It is.

1:02:54.150 --> 1:02:57.220
This whole place I need to rebuild,

1:02:57.220 --> 1:02:58.903
starting from the foundation up.

1:03:00.160 --> 1:03:02.110
Just bullshit.

1:03:02.110 --> 1:03:05.593
Just pastoral, cosmetic bullshit.

1:03:06.630 --> 1:03:08.080
- Pomp and circumstance.

1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:09.533
- [Handyman] You got that right.

1:03:13.690 --> 1:03:16.433
- I wonder if he'd be
disappointed with the world today.

1:03:17.632 --> 1:03:20.299
(choir singing)

1:03:23.931 --> 1:03:26.014
- I don't have to wonder.

1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:28.153
I know he would.

1:03:29.814 --> 1:03:30.647
He is.

1:03:35.170 --> 1:03:37.120
- You have firsthand knowledge of this?

1:03:40.054 --> 1:03:42.880
- (laughs) I certainly do.

1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:43.713
- I bet.

1:03:46.454 --> 1:03:48.854
- So you say you're a bad
Catholic. Why is that?

1:03:50.980 --> 1:03:55.173
- Non-practicing, with no
parish, no affiliation.

1:03:56.340 --> 1:03:57.583
- You still believe, then?

1:04:00.970 --> 1:04:02.909
- I guess I'm agnostic.

1:04:02.909 --> 1:04:05.492
I don't know what I can't know.

1:04:06.500 --> 1:04:07.770
- Well, that's the world today.

1:04:07.770 --> 1:04:09.930
Either you're agnostic, a atheist,

1:04:09.930 --> 1:04:12.250
or a zealot, or an asshole.

1:04:12.250 --> 1:04:13.083
Come on.

1:04:16.710 --> 1:04:19.160
So you planning on staying for a while?

1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:22.240
- No, not at all. Just passing through.

1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:23.073
- So.

1:04:26.524 --> 1:04:27.824
What if I were to tell you

1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:33.133
I was Jesus Christ,

1:04:35.726 --> 1:04:36.776
would you believe me?

1:04:38.740 --> 1:04:40.651
- You said the wine was sour?

1:04:40.651 --> 1:04:41.683
- It is.

1:04:41.683 --> 1:04:43.123
- Then, no, I wouldn't believe you.

1:04:43.123 --> 1:04:45.570
- What if I said I were the devil?

1:04:45.570 --> 1:04:47.053
- Well, bring on the
fire and brimstone, then.

1:04:47.053 --> 1:04:49.153
- That already exists right here on Earth.

1:04:50.280 --> 1:04:52.170
- Yeah, I guess sin has its rewards.

1:04:52.170 --> 1:04:53.360
- Indeed it does.

1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:55.540
People are so caught up
in the second coming,

1:04:55.540 --> 1:04:56.373
they don't realize maybe

1:04:56.373 --> 1:04:58.690
he's come here a dozen times or more,

1:04:58.690 --> 1:05:00.293
maybe a hundred times, you know?

1:05:02.493 --> 1:05:03.860
- You know, that wouldn't surprise me.

1:05:03.860 --> 1:05:05.930
- Yeah?
- Not at all.

1:05:05.930 --> 1:05:06.980
- Go on. Why is that?

1:05:09.760 --> 1:05:12.137
- Everyone's expecting the hand of God

1:05:12.137 --> 1:05:15.080
to extend from the sky
and deliver his progeny

1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:17.660
in a bright ball of angelic lights.

1:05:17.660 --> 1:05:19.410
- Preach it, brother. Go on, that's right.

1:05:19.410 --> 1:05:20.390
- But that's not his style.

1:05:20.390 --> 1:05:22.190
- No.
- No, no, no.

1:05:22.190 --> 1:05:24.810
He'd be a peasant, a pauper, a nobody,

1:05:26.643 --> 1:05:30.303
a witch burned at the stake for heresy,

1:05:31.390 --> 1:05:33.663
a slave beaten to death for blasphemy.

1:05:36.930 --> 1:05:38.143
- Dark days indeed.

1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:43.273
Back to work.

1:05:45.788 --> 1:05:47.480
Lock the door on your way out.

1:05:47.480 --> 1:05:49.980
- I'm sorry, but the church
is closed for repairs.

1:05:49.980 --> 1:05:51.602
Who are you?

1:05:51.602 --> 1:05:52.435
- Me?

1:05:54.300 --> 1:05:56.717
I'm nobody. Just a carpenter.

1:05:59.807 --> 1:06:00.974
- And you are?

1:06:03.770 --> 1:06:05.023
- Just another lost soul.

1:06:08.650 --> 1:06:09.483
- Well,

1:06:10.420 --> 1:06:13.623
sometimes we all need a little guidance.

1:06:26.200 --> 1:06:28.867
(ominous music)

1:06:30.460 --> 1:06:32.970
- I just had a hot date with your toilet.

1:06:32.970 --> 1:06:35.603
Don't worry, I didn't get
anything on the ceiling this time.

1:06:36.500 --> 1:06:38.523
Oh, looks like you went shopping, huh?

1:06:39.730 --> 1:06:41.613
- Pretty much got all your favorites.

1:06:42.730 --> 1:06:44.060
- Right on, man.

1:06:44.060 --> 1:06:46.050
- Tell me what you needed to tell me.

1:06:46.050 --> 1:06:47.730
You were doing research.

1:06:47.730 --> 1:06:49.440
- Yeah, yeah, on the Google.

1:06:49.440 --> 1:06:51.800
- It's just Google. No "the."

1:06:51.800 --> 1:06:55.000
- Well, I was on the Google
and I figured it out.

1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:56.420
- Figured what out?

1:06:56.420 --> 1:06:58.360
- What's going on with your brain.

1:06:58.360 --> 1:07:00.623
Why you're all fucked in the head.

1:07:01.633 --> 1:07:04.160
Yeah, it's a good idea, have a seat,

1:07:04.160 --> 1:07:08.490
'cause this gets real deep,
like Marianas Trench deep.

1:07:08.490 --> 1:07:11.143
Oh, and you're gonna
want one of these, too.

1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:15.453
You got a rose there.

1:07:16.723 --> 1:07:17.580
- Huh.

1:07:17.580 --> 1:07:20.870
Yeah, I found it on the
sidewalk outside this morning.

1:07:20.870 --> 1:07:22.540
- Shouldn't you put it in some water?

1:07:22.540 --> 1:07:24.510
Won't it wilt otherwise?

1:07:24.510 --> 1:07:27.880
- It's already dead. That's
prolonging the inevitable.

1:07:27.880 --> 1:07:30.220
Now, that tell me about my head.

1:07:30.220 --> 1:07:33.780
- Maybe we should get high first.

1:07:33.780 --> 1:07:36.500
- Oh, that's right. You get hight now.

1:07:36.500 --> 1:07:41.460
- That is one possibility.
One potential outcome.

1:07:41.460 --> 1:07:43.633
Yes, I get high.

1:07:44.900 --> 1:07:46.540
- What are you saying?

1:07:46.540 --> 1:07:48.960
Your lips moved and I heard words,

1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:50.483
but it didn't make any sense.

1:07:52.256 --> 1:07:57.250
- Listen, we live in an infinite universe,

1:07:57.250 --> 1:08:01.040
OK, with infinite possibilities.

1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:04.380
Every choice, every decision,

1:08:04.380 --> 1:08:07.480
every movement is a possibility

1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:10.773
with an unlimited number of outcomes.

1:08:12.694 --> 1:08:13.930
- I think I'm following you.

1:08:13.930 --> 1:08:17.510
- Yeah, every outcome has its own universe

1:08:18.370 --> 1:08:21.250
with a new set of infinite possibilities

1:08:21.250 --> 1:08:23.183
and unlimited outcomes,

1:08:24.070 --> 1:08:26.590
each playing out

1:08:26.590 --> 1:08:29.413
every single choice we ever make.

1:08:31.020 --> 1:08:32.890
- If you and I are walking

1:08:32.890 --> 1:08:35.760
and we turned right instead of left,

1:08:35.760 --> 1:08:37.210
that's one possibility.

1:08:37.210 --> 1:08:39.760
- Yes, and we create a new universe

1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:42.300
with every choice we make.

1:08:42.300 --> 1:08:45.720
- Then, there's an
entire parallel universe

1:08:45.720 --> 1:08:48.360
where we turn left instead of right.

1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:50.400
- There are infinite universes

1:08:50.400 --> 1:08:53.740
where we turned left instead of right.

1:08:53.740 --> 1:08:56.000
- There are infinite worlds

1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:58.080
where this conversation
never even happened.

1:08:58.080 --> 1:08:59.173
- Exactly.

1:09:03.290 --> 1:09:05.483
You still haven't put your
ball back in your bag?

1:09:06.350 --> 1:09:08.347
- That's one possibility.

1:09:08.347 --> 1:09:10.883
And in a parallel world I did.

1:09:12.620 --> 1:09:15.620
- And I wish this conversation
never happened in this world.

1:09:21.900 --> 1:09:25.090
- Hey, you know how Rose
always says she's a dancer?

1:09:25.090 --> 1:09:27.080
- You mean a stripper? Yeah.

1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:29.070
- But she always says dancer.

1:09:29.070 --> 1:09:30.713
- Yeah, a stripper. So what?

1:09:32.460 --> 1:09:35.310
- She's a fucking ballerina, dude.

1:09:35.310 --> 1:09:36.750
- Not a stripper?

1:09:36.750 --> 1:09:40.330
- No, ballet, like "Nutcracker" and shit.

1:09:40.330 --> 1:09:43.870
- Oh. I mean, this is Los Angeles.

1:09:43.870 --> 1:09:47.070
I just assume when someone says
dancer, they mean stripper.

1:09:47.070 --> 1:09:50.257
- Me too. I guess she's really good.

1:09:50.257 --> 1:09:53.257
"Talented and graceful." That's
what the reviews say anyway.

1:09:54.920 --> 1:09:59.920
- Oh, isn't she a little, you
know, mature to be a dancer?

1:10:00.530 --> 1:10:03.090
I mean, don't they stop
dancing when they're like 25?

1:10:03.090 --> 1:10:04.050
- I think so.

1:10:04.050 --> 1:10:07.050
It's getting tougher to compete
with the younger dancers.

1:10:07.050 --> 1:10:09.093
- See? Just like a stripper.

1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:12.400
- That's why she wants to
go to New Orleans, I think.

1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:15.030
You know, to get out of the LA scene.

1:10:15.030 --> 1:10:17.260
- Yeah. I mean, I get that.

1:10:17.260 --> 1:10:18.800
You know, in the multiverse,

1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:23.170
another universe has
her stripping. (laughs)

1:10:23.170 --> 1:10:24.833
- Infinite possibilities.

1:10:26.770 --> 1:10:28.570
- I wouldn't mind seeing that world.

1:10:34.990 --> 1:10:36.790
You still haven't heard from her, huh?

1:10:36.790 --> 1:10:37.623
- Nah.

1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:42.520
This is a tough town.

1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:46.073
- Smashes dreams. Crushes ambition.

1:10:51.590 --> 1:10:52.913
- A rose is too gentle,

1:10:55.063 --> 1:10:55.896
too beautiful,

1:10:57.350 --> 1:10:58.323
too delicate.

1:11:03.680 --> 1:11:05.080
Why is this happening to me?

1:11:07.540 --> 1:11:09.283
- This is happening to all of us.

1:11:10.740 --> 1:11:13.210
- I could accept that
the universe is infinite,

1:11:13.210 --> 1:11:15.130
with infinite multiverses,

1:11:15.130 --> 1:11:18.030
and that my life is being lived
out on infinite timelines.

1:11:19.100 --> 1:11:21.293
- Acceptance is the first step.

1:11:25.630 --> 1:11:27.570
- But why do I seem to be bouncing

1:11:27.570 --> 1:11:30.360
back and forth on different timelines?

1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:32.340
- You're a SLIder, man.

1:11:32.340 --> 1:11:36.113
You're slipping in and
out of the multiverse.

1:11:36.949 --> 1:11:37.782
- A SLIder?

1:11:40.070 --> 1:11:41.120
Is that a real thing?

1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:45.820
- You know, I think that 12,000-volt shock

1:11:45.820 --> 1:11:48.180
created some kind of imbalance

1:11:48.180 --> 1:11:50.913
between you and the multiverse.

1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:53.223
- But what's a SLIder?

1:11:54.720 --> 1:11:59.720
- It StreetLight Interference. S-L-I.

1:11:59.930 --> 1:12:02.670
That's when people first notice it.

1:12:02.670 --> 1:12:06.700
Streetlights inexplicably turn on or off,

1:12:06.700 --> 1:12:09.963
and you SLIde from one world to another.

1:12:11.980 --> 1:12:14.053
That's when people first experience it.

1:12:15.110 --> 1:12:18.003
- I don't wanna SLIde
anymore. How do I stop this?

1:12:19.450 --> 1:12:20.550
- Oh, maybe you don't.

1:12:22.070 --> 1:12:25.620
You know, or maybe you
just need to figure out

1:12:25.620 --> 1:12:29.233
which timeline this version
of you needs to stay on.

1:12:30.580 --> 1:12:32.173
Where did it all start?

1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:36.933
You figure that out
and maybe you can stop.

1:12:38.070 --> 1:12:40.780
- [Trace] Or maybe it'll just
stop on its own at some point.

1:12:40.780 --> 1:12:42.130
- I wouldn't count on that.

1:12:44.963 --> 1:12:47.630
(ominous music)

1:12:52.380 --> 1:12:54.053
Can I ask you something, Trace?

1:12:55.470 --> 1:12:56.303
- Sure.

1:12:58.340 --> 1:12:59.340
- What's in the bag?

1:13:02.563 --> 1:13:04.600
- Don't you already know?

1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:05.543
- I think so.

1:13:07.500 --> 1:13:09.720
But maybe you should tell me anyway.

1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:11.383
- Maybe you should just look.

1:13:12.835 --> 1:13:14.135
- Are you sure about that?

1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:18.690
- It really surprised me when I looked.

1:13:20.970 --> 1:13:23.470
But I have a feeling it
won't surprise you at all.

1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:26.640
Not this version of you, anyway.

1:13:51.250 --> 1:13:54.723
- Rose was simply too
delicate for this world.

1:13:57.593 --> 1:13:59.793
- But you already knew that, didn't you?

1:14:02.910 --> 1:14:06.283
- Can you SLIde when you
want? Can you do it at will?

1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:10.193
- I don't know.

1:14:11.480 --> 1:14:12.630
- Maybe you should try.

1:14:14.070 --> 1:14:16.737
(ominous music)

1:14:37.750 --> 1:14:40.667
(machines beeping)

1:14:52.193 --> 1:14:54.443
- Look at that. He's awake.

1:14:55.480 --> 1:14:56.313
- What happened?

1:14:57.560 --> 1:14:59.373
- You passed out at a restaurant.

1:15:02.290 --> 1:15:06.040
- I don't remember.

1:15:06.040 --> 1:15:06.873
What about him?

1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:11.683
- You know him? You two
were brought in together.

1:15:12.630 --> 1:15:13.473
- Yes.

1:15:14.410 --> 1:15:15.770
No.

1:15:15.770 --> 1:15:16.613
Not really.

1:15:17.730 --> 1:15:19.440
I've seen him around.

1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:23.273
- Well, you fainted, and
he was having a seizure.

1:15:24.718 --> 1:15:25.551
- A seizure?

1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:29.913
- He has a level-6 nut allergy.

1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:32.523
- Will he be OK?

1:15:34.540 --> 1:15:35.640
- Only time will tell.

1:15:45.521 --> 1:15:48.188
(ominous music)

1:15:49.150 --> 1:15:51.310
- Anaphylactic shock is a bitch.

1:15:51.310 --> 1:15:53.410
You shouldn't have given me those peanuts.

1:15:55.050 --> 1:15:56.083
- Satan?

1:15:57.690 --> 1:16:00.170
- Please, call me Luke.

1:16:00.170 --> 1:16:01.920
- That's kind of strange.

1:16:01.920 --> 1:16:03.410
- Stranger than talking to the devil

1:16:03.410 --> 1:16:05.210
in a hospital in Long Beach?

1:16:05.210 --> 1:16:09.230
- Long Beach? God, this has to be a dream.

1:16:09.230 --> 1:16:11.073
- Nope. Real life.

1:16:12.370 --> 1:16:13.203
Breathe.

1:16:15.380 --> 1:16:16.433
Take a deep breath.

1:16:18.890 --> 1:16:19.723
Good.

1:16:21.590 --> 1:16:23.210
Do it again.

1:16:23.210 --> 1:16:25.783
Let the calm overcome you.

1:16:32.930 --> 1:16:35.660
You should feel relaxed now.

1:16:35.660 --> 1:16:37.420
- Is this hell?

1:16:37.420 --> 1:16:38.433
- It's Long Beach.

1:16:39.580 --> 1:16:40.673
- Right.

1:16:43.190 --> 1:16:45.773
- Peace, that's what I feel.

1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:47.633
- Me too.

1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:52.040
- Good. Now we can talk.

1:16:52.040 --> 1:16:53.503
You wanted to see me?

1:16:54.730 --> 1:16:55.563
- I did?

1:16:57.280 --> 1:16:59.030
- You wouldn't be here otherwise.

1:16:59.030 --> 1:17:01.160
- I wasn't looking for you.

1:17:01.160 --> 1:17:03.650
- And yet, here you are.

1:17:03.650 --> 1:17:07.120
- I was electrocuted recently. Am I dead?

1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:09.203
- No, you're very much alive.

1:17:10.520 --> 1:17:14.130
- Well, what does the
devil want with me, then.

1:17:14.130 --> 1:17:17.260
- I want nothing unless something is owed.

1:17:17.260 --> 1:17:20.240
There are two reasons
why people come to me.

1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:22.620
Either they're going to do something

1:17:22.620 --> 1:17:24.127
or they've already done it.

1:17:24.127 --> 1:17:27.263
And this meeting is a
consequence of those actions.

1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:36.960
What do you desire, Trace
McNeil. What have you done?

1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:37.833
- Nothing.

1:17:40.110 --> 1:17:42.650
- We can't base a relationship on lies.

1:17:42.650 --> 1:17:44.373
It's impossible to deceive me.

1:17:56.150 --> 1:17:57.000
What's happening?

1:18:01.240 --> 1:18:04.490
- I'm SLIding. That's what Quinn calls it.

1:18:04.490 --> 1:18:05.573
- SLIding?

1:18:07.730 --> 1:18:09.303
Ever since the electrocution,

1:18:10.570 --> 1:18:13.413
I've been unbalanced, off-kilter.

1:18:14.920 --> 1:18:17.560
I go in and out of consciousness.

1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:19.793
Lights flash, I fade away,

1:18:20.920 --> 1:18:22.920
and things are different when I wake up.

1:18:24.020 --> 1:18:26.007
- That sounds very troubling.

1:18:26.007 --> 1:18:30.530
And how does your friend
Quinn explain this phenomenon?

1:18:30.530 --> 1:18:33.203
- He thinks I'm slipping
between parallel universes,

1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:38.800
experiencing moments of infinite
possibilities and outcomes

1:18:38.800 --> 1:18:40.590
in my own personal multiverse.

1:18:40.590 --> 1:18:42.390
- Quinn is a very ambitious thinker.

1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:45.573
- Maybe. I don't know.

1:18:46.650 --> 1:18:48.293
Is he right? Do you know?

1:18:50.140 --> 1:18:53.090
- This is a very complex
and layered existence,

1:18:53.090 --> 1:18:56.360
but there are not infinite possibilities,

1:18:56.360 --> 1:18:58.123
choices, or outcomes.

1:18:59.640 --> 1:19:03.360
There are moments that
define each and every soul,

1:19:03.360 --> 1:19:07.883
significant choices that
separate fate from free will.

1:19:09.770 --> 1:19:11.400
When this happens, your spirit could exist

1:19:11.400 --> 1:19:13.060
on two or three planes,

1:19:13.060 --> 1:19:17.723
experiencing the consequences
of each choice simultaneously.

1:19:20.190 --> 1:19:21.573
- I kind of understand.

1:19:23.440 --> 1:19:25.180
- For some, this only occurs

1:19:25.180 --> 1:19:27.423
a handful of times throughout their life.

1:19:29.870 --> 1:19:33.723
For others, it's a constant,
and they live in turmoil.

1:19:34.680 --> 1:19:37.330
The subconscious is powerful.

1:19:37.330 --> 1:19:40.773
It knows the choices, and every outcome.

1:19:42.110 --> 1:19:44.863
- I have lived a mostly
impartial existence.

1:19:46.130 --> 1:19:48.483
What consequences have led me here?

1:19:49.460 --> 1:19:51.530
- Your spirit may travel the multiverse,

1:19:51.530 --> 1:19:53.383
but you only have one soul.

1:19:54.520 --> 1:19:59.150
Sooner or later those consequences
will play themselves out,

1:19:59.150 --> 1:20:01.130
and you'll be whole again,

1:20:01.130 --> 1:20:04.013
but the outcome will always be the same.

1:20:06.230 --> 1:20:11.080
- When two roads diverge, if
I take the road less traveled,

1:20:11.080 --> 1:20:12.590
it will not make any difference.

1:20:12.590 --> 1:20:14.610
Is that what I'm to understand?

1:20:14.610 --> 1:20:19.560
- No difference. None at all. (laughs)

1:20:19.560 --> 1:20:24.560
- But if the outcome is ordained,
my fate has been decided.

1:20:24.990 --> 1:20:26.810
- Fate? No.

1:20:26.810 --> 1:20:28.890
Fate is a product of free will.

1:20:28.890 --> 1:20:31.890
What brought you to the fork
in the road in the first place?

1:20:32.920 --> 1:20:34.500
- My own decisions.

1:20:34.500 --> 1:20:38.040
- Exactly. Free will determines fate.

1:20:38.040 --> 1:20:40.813
They exist together. It's
not one or the other.

1:20:43.140 --> 1:20:44.353
You're in a hospital.

1:20:45.460 --> 1:20:46.730
There are plenty of ways

1:20:46.730 --> 1:20:49.253
to let free will determine your fate.

1:20:50.230 --> 1:20:53.363
Look around. Find something sharp.

1:20:55.680 --> 1:20:57.430
- I wanna go home.

1:20:57.430 --> 1:20:59.270
I wanna be back in my universe,

1:20:59.270 --> 1:21:02.590
my existence, my solitary world.

1:21:02.590 --> 1:21:04.373
- And yet, here you are.

1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:07.390
Do you believe in fate?

1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:10.620
- I suppose.

1:21:10.620 --> 1:21:11.693
- And free will?

1:21:13.320 --> 1:21:14.853
- Two roads diverge.

1:21:16.290 --> 1:21:19.680
I could SLIde out of here or I could stay.

1:21:19.680 --> 1:21:21.420
Two paths.

1:21:21.420 --> 1:21:23.663
- And you can choose either.

1:21:24.830 --> 1:21:27.030
- But there could only
be one final outcome.

1:21:28.590 --> 1:21:29.773
- Only one.

1:21:32.520 --> 1:21:35.063
- The path I have always been on.

1:21:36.100 --> 1:21:39.723
The one true timeline I
have always been living.

1:21:45.220 --> 1:21:46.253
This isn't me.

1:21:47.370 --> 1:21:48.703
This isn't my true path.

1:21:54.460 --> 1:21:57.127
(ominous music)

1:22:00.759 --> 1:22:03.426
(glitchy music)

1:22:06.983 --> 1:22:08.843
- New Orleans, here we come.

1:22:08.843 --> 1:22:11.462
(chimes tinkling)

1:22:11.462 --> 1:22:13.712
- They're not ready for us.

1:22:15.400 --> 1:22:17.903
- I'll be right back. I
have to use the ladies room.

1:22:28.780 --> 1:22:30.030
- This is everything

1:22:31.570 --> 1:22:32.643
I ever wanted,

1:22:35.040 --> 1:22:36.143
right here,

1:22:37.750 --> 1:22:38.803
right now,

1:22:46.987 --> 1:22:48.333
But it's wrong.

1:22:49.886 --> 1:22:52.553
(glitchy music)

1:23:01.852 --> 1:23:04.519
(glitchy music)

1:23:15.185 --> 1:23:17.308
- Oh, it's you.

1:23:17.308 --> 1:23:18.808
- Don't eat those!

1:23:19.671 --> 1:23:23.991
No, this isn't right either.

1:23:23.991 --> 1:23:25.740
(glitchy music)

1:23:25.740 --> 1:23:28.323
(man laughing)

1:23:35.625 --> 1:23:38.649
No, no, no.

1:23:38.649 --> 1:23:39.732
I'm so sorry.

1:23:42.545 --> 1:23:44.712
I guess this is really me.

1:23:45.708 --> 1:23:49.841
This is who I am.

1:23:49.841 --> 1:23:54.841
And these are the things I've done.

1:23:58.206 --> 1:23:59.123
No, no, no.

1:24:01.318 --> 1:24:02.769
This isn't right either.

1:24:02.769 --> 1:24:05.436
(glitchy music)

1:24:21.188 --> 1:24:22.105
This is it.

1:24:22.950 --> 1:24:24.293
This feels right.

1:24:26.070 --> 1:24:27.323
Now, where am I?

1:24:34.410 --> 1:24:35.243
I remember now.

1:24:37.860 --> 1:24:40.153
This is my reality.

1:24:43.206 --> 1:24:46.123
(zombies growling)

1:24:49.663 --> 1:24:50.496
Oh shit!

1:25:07.291 --> 1:25:08.124
Oh shit!

1:25:27.480 --> 1:25:30.300
- The streets of Los
Angeles are apocalyptic.

1:25:30.300 --> 1:25:33.170
This looks like a stolen
scene from a horror movie.

1:25:33.170 --> 1:25:38.170
But this is not science
fiction. This is our reality.

1:25:38.740 --> 1:25:41.310
It all began shortly after
a surge of electricity

1:25:41.310 --> 1:25:43.740
shocked the Southland yesterday morning,

1:25:43.740 --> 1:25:48.170
first a few isolated
cases, and then everywhere.

1:25:48.170 --> 1:25:50.420
But make no mistake,

1:25:50.420 --> 1:25:53.103
the dead have risen.
