00:06.172 --> 00:11.043
Reedus: <i>Northern california</i>
<i>is so much different</i>
<i>than southern california.</i>

00:11.045 --> 00:13.212
- Imogen lehtonen:
<i>It's different.</i>
<i>- It's such a different energy.</i>

00:13.214 --> 00:16.482
Lehtonen:
<i>Epic cliffs and huge ocean</i>
<i>underneath it.</i>

00:16.484 --> 00:19.151
<i>Just from right here</i>
<i>we can go ride the ocean,</i>

00:19.153 --> 00:23.555
<i>Get the sun, and we can go</i>
<i>right up into the redwoods</i>
<i>and be in twisties.</i>

00:23.557 --> 00:26.558
Reedus:
<i>I kind of feel like</i>
<i>this is the future.</i>

00:26.560 --> 00:30.129
Cali's the mecca, man.
So many great little excursions
on the way up.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.697
Ah! Whoo!

00:31.699 --> 00:33.565
lehtonen: <i>This is so crazy.</i>

00:33.567 --> 00:35.200
<i>I'm so happy</i>
<i>we found this place.</i>

00:35.202 --> 00:38.337
Anything that makes noise
attracts zombies.

00:38.339 --> 00:41.440
Is your dog snoring right now?
Is that what that was?

00:41.442 --> 00:43.742
man: <i>Are we gonna ride</i>
<i>or what?</i>

00:43.744 --> 00:45.544
Let's do it.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.769
Reedus:
<i>I was in my early 20s when</i>
<i>I moved to los angeles.</i>

01:10.771 --> 01:13.672
<i>Just a kid trying</i>
<i>to figure myself out.</i>

01:13.674 --> 01:18.577
<i>It was in the late '90s,</i>
<i>and I kind of fell into this</i>
<i>underground scene</i>

01:18.579 --> 01:22.514
<i>Of outsiders and rebels</i>
<i>and actors.</i>

01:22.516 --> 01:24.349
<i>And then there were</i>
<i>the bikers.</i>

01:25.553 --> 01:29.521
<i>I'll always feel</i>
<i>at home here.</i>

01:29.523 --> 01:33.192
<i>This is the place</i>
<i>where everything</i>
<i>came together for me.</i>

01:33.194 --> 01:36.095
<i>The first place</i>
<i>where I felt I belonged.</i>

01:37.530 --> 01:40.666
<i>And now?</i>
<i>Now I'm pretty damn lucky.</i>

01:40.668 --> 01:44.803
<i>I have a cool job where</i>
<i>I get to ride motorcycles</i>
<i>and kill zombies.</i>

01:46.473 --> 01:49.141
<i>On the weekends,</i>
<i>I just ride motorcycles.</i>

01:52.179 --> 01:54.847
<i>Even though this is where</i>
<i>I really learned to love bikes,</i>

01:54.849 --> 01:57.149
<i>And I rode all the time,</i>

01:57.151 --> 02:00.586
<i>I never really had</i>
<i>the chance to explore.</i>

02:00.588 --> 02:02.688
<i>That's why I'm so excited</i>
<i>to be back.</i>

02:02.690 --> 02:05.557
<i>Taking my first ride</i>
<i>up the pacific coast highway.</i>

02:07.193 --> 02:10.195
Announcer:
<i>From the mexican border,</i>
<i>the highway runs parallel</i>

02:10.197 --> 02:13.332
<i>With the pacific coast</i>
<i>through california.</i>

02:13.334 --> 02:15.467
<i>At times the highway winds</i>

02:15.469 --> 02:19.171
<i>Along the sheer cliff face</i>
<i>above the sea.</i>

02:19.173 --> 02:21.140
Reedus:
<i>I've heard that the pacific</i>
<i>coast highway</i>

02:21.142 --> 02:24.409
<i>Is one of the most</i>
<i>savagely beautiful roads</i>
<i>you can do anywhere.</i>

02:24.411 --> 02:28.447
<i>I'm starting out in la,</i>
<i>then winding 400 miles</i>
<i>up the coast,</i>

02:28.449 --> 02:30.749
<i>Stopping in santa barbara</i>
<i>and pismo beach</i>

02:30.751 --> 02:34.486
<i>Before ending up in</i>
<i>the ultimate biker town,</i>
<i>santa cruz,</i>

02:34.488 --> 02:36.855
<i>Where I'm gonna talk bikes</i>
<i>and "the walking dead"</i>

02:36.857 --> 02:39.858
<i>On one of my favorite</i>
<i>podcasts.</i>

02:39.860 --> 02:43.428
<i>Before heading out,</i>
<i>I'm stopping in long beach</i>

02:44.330 --> 02:47.900
<i>To pay homage to motorcycle</i>
<i>guru roland sands.</i>

02:47.902 --> 02:50.302
<i>Roland's an award-winning,</i>
<i>record-breaking road racer</i>

02:50.304 --> 02:53.338
<i>Turned custom bike artist.</i>

02:53.340 --> 02:57.776
<i>He's got a solid rep</i>
<i>and towers over the innovative</i>
<i>california biker scene.</i>

02:59.212 --> 03:02.881
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>I'd miss a chance at finally</i>
<i>checking out his shop.</i>

03:02.883 --> 03:05.384
- Hey, what's up, norman?
- Hey, nice to meet you, roland.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.486
- Absolutely.
- I've heard great things
about you.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.655
Welcome, man.
I've heard some great
things about you as well.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.390
Yeah, I came over here
on this sucker.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.759
- This hypermotard.
- Sick, man.

03:13.761 --> 03:16.662
Reedus:
<i>I'm riding a ducati</i>
<i>hypermotard 939.</i>

03:16.664 --> 03:18.530
<i>It's got a sleek</i>
<i>minimalistic design</i>

03:18.532 --> 03:20.699
<i>And sweet</i>
<i>"blade runner" curves.</i>

03:20.701 --> 03:23.902
<i>That makes it great</i>
<i>for navigating through</i>
<i>mangled city traffic</i>

03:23.904 --> 03:25.571
<i>And cutting loose</i>
<i>on the open road.</i>

03:25.573 --> 03:27.372
These bikes, man,
to me, they're just, like,

03:27.374 --> 03:29.341
The sickest
hooligan bike ever.

03:29.343 --> 03:32.244
Show me some
of your stuff, man.
I want to see everything.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.912
This is our home, dude.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.381
Wow, it's like a museum.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.983
Man, there are so many
bikes crammed in here.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.686
- There are 75 bikes
in this building.
- Wow.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.222
We build cafe racers
out of sportsters.

03:43.224 --> 03:45.324
So we have a whole line
of hard parts that we sell.

03:45.326 --> 03:48.794
<i>That's a hypermotard</i>
<i>slash 999 ducati.</i>

03:48.796 --> 03:50.696
This is so "mad max"
right here.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.764
Super zombie killer bike.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.300
Sands:
<i>That's one of the first</i>
<i>customs I ever built.</i>

03:55.302 --> 03:58.237
Reedus:
This is beautiful.
You pretty much do everything.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.472
Is there anything
you don't do?

04:00.474 --> 04:02.341
Sleep.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.409
I know that very well.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.411
What's up?
Good morning. Hi.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.913
How's it going,
everybody?

04:11.986 --> 04:14.753
When people see your bikes,
they automatically know
they're yours.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.723
- Kind of, yeah.
- What makes
a roland sands bike?

04:17.725 --> 04:20.392
I think primarily, like,
I want to build bikes

04:20.394 --> 04:22.327
That work better
than the stock bike.

04:22.329 --> 04:24.429
<i>We increase the performance</i>
<i>level, better brakes,</i>

04:24.431 --> 04:27.666
Better wheels, you know,
and I think the blending
of styles, too.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.335
Like, this bike
kind of just kicked off
my career in a sense.

04:30.337 --> 04:32.537
<i>'cause this bike</i>
<i>was, like, the blend</i>

04:32.539 --> 04:35.274
Of sport bike
and chopper culture

04:35.276 --> 04:37.709
Smashed together
in one motorcycle.

04:37.711 --> 04:41.013
<i>And people just had never</i>
<i>seen that type of approach</i>
<i>to a bike before.</i>

04:41.015 --> 04:44.383
Reedus:
<i>Wow.</i>

04:44.385 --> 04:45.984
- Is this your pop
right here?
- Yeah.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.320
My dad started a company
called performance machines.

04:48.322 --> 04:51.356
So, I mean, when
I was five years old,
I was at drag races.

04:51.358 --> 04:55.027
You know, I used to go
to laguna seca and go watch
the grand prix back then.

04:55.029 --> 04:56.428
Seca's awesome.

04:59.565 --> 05:00.866
So I can ride
one of these?

05:00.868 --> 05:03.368
This is the fleet, man.

05:03.370 --> 05:06.505
So we got flat track racers.
Harley softails.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.607
Cafe racers.
This is a superleggera.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.309
What about this guy?
How's this one?

05:10.311 --> 05:14.546
This is a bmw ninet.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.848
- Reedus: <i>It's so pretty. </i>
<i>-</i> <i>It's a fun bike.</i>

05:16.850 --> 05:18.517
We did a number plate
on the front,

05:18.519 --> 05:22.054
Moved the oil cooler up
so we exposed the breastplate.

05:22.056 --> 05:24.056
Ohlin suspension
front and rear.

05:24.058 --> 05:26.892
<i>Custom exhaust,</i>
<i>one-off exhaust.</i>

05:26.894 --> 05:29.795
-  <i>It's a badass-sounding bike. </i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

05:37.670 --> 05:39.671
I'll grab your bike
and I'll meet you
in the back.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.340
All right, cool.

05:43.409 --> 05:47.713
Reedus:
<i>Roland's taking me to one</i>
<i>of his favorite spots nearby.</i>

05:47.715 --> 05:49.548
<i>Never thought I'd get</i>
<i>a chance to ride alongside</i>

05:49.550 --> 05:52.484
<i>A legit championship</i>
<i>racer like him.</i>

05:52.486 --> 05:55.721
<i>The dude makes crazy,</i>
<i>mindboggling stunts look easy.</i>

05:55.723 --> 05:57.622
- Reedus:
<i>I've never been here. </i>
<i>- This is my old hood.</i>

05:57.624 --> 05:59.491
-  <i>This is your hood right here </i>
<i>- this is where I grew up.</i>

06:02.962 --> 06:05.897
Yeah.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.447
Yeah.

06:22.449 --> 06:24.149
That was awesome.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.951
Yeah, I like to mess
around a little bit.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.018
I'm kind of an idiot.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.421
I will not
be doing that.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.457
- Loving this.
- You like it?

06:32.459 --> 06:36.595
I like the way
this handles and rides.
It's so nice.

06:36.597 --> 06:39.531
Reedus:
<i>There's nothing like being</i>
<i>on one of roland's bikes.</i>

06:39.533 --> 06:42.534
<i>It's clear that he takes pride</i>
<i>in every single detail.</i>

06:42.536 --> 06:44.903
<i>The machine fits your body</i>
<i>like a glove.</i>

06:47.740 --> 06:50.609
This is beautiful, dude.

06:50.611 --> 06:54.679
- Sands: <i>Palos verdes. </i>
<i>-</i>  <i>Palos verdes.</i>

06:59.485 --> 07:02.087
This is beautiful
up here, man.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.590
Yeah, this is like a ride
we do on the weekends.
We come up here.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.859
- And that's catalina.
- That's catalina right there.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.895
Spend a lot
of time over there.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.664
Is pch like this?
This sort of vibe?

07:12.666 --> 07:14.433
It's even a little bit
more grand.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.201
It's like the mountains
just got--

07:16.203 --> 07:17.836
Like god cut
the mountains off

07:17.838 --> 07:19.971
And it drops straight down
into the ocean.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.973
- Wow.
- It's amazing.

07:21.975 --> 07:25.110
<i>I could live</i>
<i>here in a heartbeat.</i>
<i>This is great.</i>

07:25.112 --> 07:26.812
Well, dude, right on.
I'm out.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.980
I'm gonna go head up
and go back to work, man.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.882
- I wish I could go with you.
- <i>That would be great.</i>

07:30.884 --> 07:33.518
I would love it.
I might steal your motorcycle
and take it with me.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.086
- Go for it.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.955
- I think it likes you.
-  <i>Can I take it?</i>

07:36.957 --> 07:38.757
Yeah, as long as you
get it back, I don't care.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.926
- Eeee! Done.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.994
- Thank you, bro.
- All right, norman.
Be safe.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.897
- Have fun
and take chances.
- I will. It'll be fun.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.966
<i>"can't get enough" playing</i>

Reedus:
<i>As soon as I was on the bike,</i>

08:08.889 --> 08:11.223
<i>I felt buckled down</i>
<i>to the road.</i>

08:11.225 --> 08:16.094
<i>And I was honored</i>
<i>that roland let me borrow it</i>
<i>for the rest of the ride.</i>

08:21.768 --> 08:25.637
<i>To pick up one of</i>

08:49.796 --> 08:52.197
<i>And I'm stoked we're finally </i>
<i>gonna do it.</i>

08:53.900 --> 08:55.767
- Yay!
- Hi, sweetheart.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.302
- Hi.
- How are you?

08:57.304 --> 08:59.538
- Good, how you doing?
- I'm good. I'm good.

08:59.540 --> 09:00.906
- It's been a minute.
- Hell, yeah.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.307
- Look at this thing.
- Yeah, right?

09:02.309 --> 09:04.743
I took a ducati
to roland sands' place,

09:04.745 --> 09:07.312
And I liked this so much
I kind of stole it from him.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.080
- That is a crazy
looking bike.
- Yeah.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.116
So we'll take this
up the coast with us.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.652
- I mean, this is yours, right?
- Yes. Well, it's not mine.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.788
I'm borrowing it,
but I love this thing.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.691
Reedus:
<i>Imogen is riding a custom</i>
<i>harley dyna t-sport</i>

09:19.693 --> 09:22.794
<i>Made by la's own</i>
<i>powerplant motorcycles.</i>

09:22.929 --> 09:26.331
<i>With high-set t-bar</i>
<i>handlebars and a blacked-out</i>
<i>powder coating,</i>

09:26.333 --> 09:29.234
<i>This bike is as badass</i>
<i>as she is.</i>

09:29.236 --> 09:34.606
- I know, and this has, like,
an adjustable windshield.
- Oh, it goes up and down?

09:34.608 --> 09:36.942
Reedus:
I'm excited to get on our bikes
<i>and start the ride.</i>

09:36.944 --> 09:38.710
- <i>But first... </i>
<i>- Show me your shop.</i>

09:38.712 --> 09:41.713
<i>...I got to pick up a ring</i>
<i>imogen promised me.</i>

09:41.715 --> 09:44.950
- Come in the shop.
- This is awesome in here.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.685
Reedus:
<i>Did you-- I mean,</i>
<i>this is all you?</i>

09:46.687 --> 09:48.787
Yes. So my uncle
and my aunt started it,

09:48.789 --> 09:50.989
And my parents--
my mom and dad met
working there together,

09:50.991 --> 09:52.958
So I have a jewelry family.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.727
Wow. Tell me
about that creepy skeleton
up there in the corner.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.963
- Real or not real?
- <i>It's not real.</i>

09:57.965 --> 10:01.933
This is actually
our resident only real
skull in the shop.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.302
Our london shop is actually
built on a plague pit.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.105
So when there was,
like, the black plague
and they had mass graves--

10:07.107 --> 10:10.809
And they excavated in
the basement of our shop,
and it was a mass grave.

10:10.811 --> 10:15.113
And a lot of the original
skulls we have in our london
shop are from there.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.283
What? What?
That's sort of creepy.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.918
You need to pick
a ring as well.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.019
You've got to have
a skull ring.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.821
Can you pick one
for me?

10:22.823 --> 10:25.023
- I can do that.
- Yeah?

10:26.325 --> 10:28.727
I feel like you need
a gnarly looking skull.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.129
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is perfect for me.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.732
Let's see if he fits.
Are you excited?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.900
I'm excited, yeah.
This is my first ring ever.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.269
- And it fits.
- Yeah, this is badass.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.639
Were you wearing
all your stuff in atlanta
when we met?

10:40.641 --> 10:42.774
On the cross-country trip
I wore some of my stuff.

10:42.776 --> 10:46.011
I wasn't as heavily
loaded as I usually am
when I'm around la.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.712
That was really fun
when you guys all came down.

10:47.714 --> 10:51.016
I had such a good time.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.418
Reedus:
<i>And we're going up</i>
<i>pch to santa cruz.</i>

10:53.420 --> 10:56.154
Okay, that's the most beautiful
ride in california you can do.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.891
There's a podcast up there
which is "motorcycle misfits."

10:59.893 --> 11:02.661
Really?
I'm scared to hear
my voice on a podcast...

11:02.663 --> 11:04.062
- Your voice is great.
- ...But it'll be fun.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.898
Tonight, there is
an airstream motor camp

11:06.900 --> 11:09.067
- That would be
so cool to stay at.
- Oh, nice.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.369
- They deck them out
to make them look awesome.
- Where is that?

11:11.371 --> 11:13.405
- In santa barbara.
- I love airstreams,

11:13.407 --> 11:15.306
But I've never been
in an airstream.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.976
- All right.
- Cool, let's go hit
the highway.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.146
Reedus:
<i>All right, let's do this.</i>

11:21.148 --> 11:22.447
Lehtonen:
<i>All right.</i>

11:23.015 --> 11:25.150
You ready, babe?

11:29.388 --> 11:33.358
This changed so much here.
There used to be this place
called damiano's right there.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.428
A pizza place.
It's where I first
became an actor.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.797
- It was in that pizza place.
- That's cool.

11:38.799 --> 11:42.300
Reedus:
<i>It's true, I really did</i>
<i>become an actor at damiano's.</i>

11:42.302 --> 11:44.769
<i>It's a long story,</i>
<i>but let's just say</i>

11:44.771 --> 11:47.839
<i>I was in the right place</i>
<i>at the right time,</i>
<i>and the rest is history.</i>

11:49.875 --> 11:52.243
<i>Now it's time</i>
<i>to head north</i>

11:52.245 --> 11:54.345
<i>97 miles</i>
<i>to santa barbara.</i>

11:55.981 --> 11:58.183
- This is fun.
- I like riding
around with you.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.819
It's gonna be even
better when we're on
the open road, too.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.955
And it will be,
like, daytime and, like,
beautiful coast.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.291
Reedus:
<i>We'll be picking up the pch</i>
<i>in the morning,</i>

12:06.293 --> 12:08.359
<i>So we just need a place</i>
<i>to bed down.</i>

12:08.361 --> 12:11.763
<i>And the santa barbara</i>
<i>autocamp with personal</i>
<i>airstreams</i>

12:11.765 --> 12:13.998
<i>Couldn't be more perfect.</i>

12:14.000 --> 12:17.035
- This is so cool.
- They match my bike.

12:17.037 --> 12:19.738
Oh, yeah.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.006
I love that they put
astroturf around, too.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.775
- Yeah.
- All right.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.144
Oh, my god.
They have a bathtub.

12:26.146 --> 12:29.748
- Coffee pot, check.
- It's even got a little
kitchen and a mini fridge.

12:29.750 --> 12:33.017
- I'm having this one.
- This is yours? You got it.
Done.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.186
Tomorrow's gonna be,
like, pch.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.322
Beautiful, no la traffic.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.758
- Yeah, let's hope so.
- It'll be the pretty part.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.827
Yeah, good.
I'm gonna go take a bath
in an air bubble.

12:42.829 --> 12:45.130
<i>bye!</i>

12:55.074 --> 12:56.441
What the?
You peeper.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.143
<i>little peeper.</i>

12:59.345 --> 13:02.247
- The ocean! Whoo!
- Oh, the ocean.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.449
- <i>Are these electric? </i>
<i>- Oh, cool.</i>

13:04.451 --> 13:07.519
- <i>He was a garbage man</i>
<i>for 30 years. </i>
<i>- Lehtonen:</i> <i>Wow.</i>

13:07.521 --> 13:10.421
- Oh, my god!

13:23.068 --> 13:27.172
<i>"hollywood" playing</i>

13:27.174 --> 13:31.242
are you having
a party in here?

13:31.244 --> 13:34.179
This is so cool.
I like sleeping
in an airstream.

13:34.181 --> 13:37.115
It was pretty cool
except for every time
you walk by a desk,

13:37.117 --> 13:39.050
You clear the desk
by accident.

13:39.052 --> 13:42.053
- You know what I mean?
- I didn't have that problem.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.255
Yeah, well,
you're skinny,
that's why.

13:44.257 --> 13:47.158
- All right, let's roll.
- You're not exactly fat.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.527
Not exactly fat?
What is that supposed to mean?

13:52.465 --> 13:55.400
- I'm excited to ride.
- Yeah, it's gonna be
nice today.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.872
<i>ready?</i>

14:06.078 --> 14:08.146
Wow, it's so pretty.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.081
- So beautiful.
- Yeah.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.950
Reedus:
<i>We're headed north</i>
<i>on the pch</i>

14:11.952 --> 14:14.986
<i>104 miles from santa barbara</i>
<i>to pismo beach.</i>

14:16.021 --> 14:17.622
Can you hear me?

14:17.624 --> 14:19.524
When do we get
to the ocean?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.426
I can't understand you.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.165
Reedus:
<i>How'd you sleep</i>
<i>in that airstream?</i>

14:27.167 --> 14:29.334
I'm just gonna guess
at what you're saying.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.302
Something about
an alarm clock.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.638
Nothing about alaska.

14:36.943 --> 14:39.143
A baked alaska.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.646
- The ocean! Whoo!
- Oh, the ocean.

14:41.648 --> 14:44.349
- <i>Yeah. </i>
<i>-</i> <i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

14:44.351 --> 14:47.485
<i>Is one of the most</i>
<i>breathtaking roads ever.</i>

14:47.487 --> 14:49.220
<i>It opened in the late 1920s</i>

14:49.222 --> 14:51.522
<i>As part of</i>
<i>the roosevelt highway,</i>

14:51.524 --> 14:55.593
<i>The first road</i>
<i>to link the mexican</i>
<i>and canadian borders.</i>

14:55.595 --> 14:58.363
<i>With its snaking curves</i>
<i>and sharp drops,</i>

14:58.365 --> 15:00.131
<i>People travel from all</i>
<i>over the world</i>

15:00.133 --> 15:02.600
<i>To see what makes it</i>
<i>so uniquely californian.</i>

15:02.602 --> 15:06.537
- Look how sparkly it is.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

15:06.539 --> 15:08.506
Reedus:
<i>With the ocean right there</i>
<i>next to you,</i>

15:08.508 --> 15:10.608
<i>Man, this is how</i>
<i>you're supposed to ride.</i>

15:13.245 --> 15:15.246
<i>I mean, check out</i>
<i>that view.</i>

15:15.248 --> 15:17.315
Pismo beach, 15 miles.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.150
Yeah.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.185
Reedus:
<i>Pismo beach is five</i>
<i>and a half miles</i>

15:21.187 --> 15:23.621
<i>Of pristine sand dunes</i>
<i>and one of the only beaches</i>

15:23.623 --> 15:25.590
<i>In america</i>
<i>you can actually drive onto.</i>

15:25.592 --> 15:27.659
Let's go to the beach.

15:27.661 --> 15:32.030
<i>I'm down to see what kind of</i>
<i>off-road action we can find.</i>

15:34.566 --> 15:37.302
Look how pretty this is.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.570
Yeah, this is
beautiful.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.574
What are these
little birds called?

15:43.576 --> 15:46.077
Oyster catchers.
They're cute.

15:48.547 --> 15:50.181
How cold you reckon
the water is?

15:50.183 --> 15:52.083
- Freezing?
- I bet it's freezing.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.020
Stay away from me.

15:57.089 --> 15:59.223
That looks like
a dune buggy, right?

15:59.225 --> 16:01.225
That's cool.
Have you ever
dune-buggied?

16:01.227 --> 16:02.460
- Never.
- Me either.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.630
- Let's go dune buggy.
- ♪ little dune buggy.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.232
Reedus:
<i>Dune buggies on the beach?</i>
<i>Right on.</i>

16:08.234 --> 16:10.702
<i>There's no way we're gonna let</i>
<i>this opportunity pass by.</i>

16:10.704 --> 16:14.205
- Glad to meet you. Robert.
- Hi, imogen.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.240
- Oh, cool. Thank you.
- Your first time out here?

16:16.242 --> 16:19.544
- First time ever
here and on a dune buggy.
- First time dune-buggying.

16:19.546 --> 16:22.547
Part of our protocol
too is you have to
watch a safety video.

16:22.549 --> 16:25.249
Okay.
What did you do
to your screen?

16:25.251 --> 16:27.318
- Well...
- It's beach modified.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.721
It's kind of scary
to watch a safety video
on this screen.

16:29.723 --> 16:32.156
- You know what I mean?
- We're a little hard
on things out here.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.592
Man on video:
<i>Avoid all wildlife.</i>

16:34.594 --> 16:37.161
Can you imagine
trying to run over
these little birds?

16:37.163 --> 16:39.464
- Do people do that?
- They try.

16:39.466 --> 16:42.100
<i>You are assuming all risks</i>
<i>for any damage,</i>

16:42.102 --> 16:43.501
- <i>Injury, or loss of life. </i>
<i>- Lehtonen: This is gonna</i>
<i>  be fun.</i>

16:43.503 --> 16:46.204
- Loss of life?
- Animal life.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.239
<i>Now you're ready</i>
<i>to drive the dunes.</i>

16:52.078 --> 16:53.745
- Reedus: <i>Shall we hit it? </i>
<i>-</i> <i>Let's do it.</i>

16:53.747 --> 16:56.547
What's the fastest
one you have?
This one?

16:56.549 --> 16:58.583
have a good time.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.152
Reedus:
<i>Everybody say "whiplash."</i>

17:02.421 --> 17:04.188
Man:
<i>You guys can go.</i>

17:04.190 --> 17:06.591
Whoo!

17:06.593 --> 17:08.526
<i>"endless mountain" playing</i>

17:10.529 --> 17:12.597
Reedus:
You ready?
Check this out.

17:12.599 --> 17:16.401
Are you serious?
Oh my god that looks crazy!

17:19.238 --> 17:21.205
Yeah!
Whoo!

17:24.309 --> 17:28.446
This way.
Go right down
this big mountain.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.415
Aah!

17:34.286 --> 17:37.655
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

17:39.792 --> 17:43.194
Hold on, I got stuck.
I got stuck on this hill.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.331
I'm over here.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.668
Whoa.

17:50.670 --> 17:54.205
Whoa, I don't know
if I can do this.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.842
Whoo!

18:00.212 --> 18:02.480
Whee!
Whoo!

18:06.618 --> 18:08.453
- Aw!
- <i>I'm coming!</i>

18:15.761 --> 18:18.529
- I'm sorry, norman.
- I got you, babe.

18:20.332 --> 18:22.700
I'm driving
like a grandma,
aren't I?

18:27.406 --> 18:29.207
Whoo!

18:29.209 --> 18:31.576
This way.
Here we go.

18:31.578 --> 18:34.679
Follow me.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.347
Ah!

18:43.622 --> 18:46.491
Oh! Whoa, airborne.
I just went airborne.

18:46.493 --> 18:49.527
My god!
Whoo! Whoo!

18:49.529 --> 18:52.263
- I got some air.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.165
Let's go to the big one.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.234
- Oh,.
- Oh my god.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.803
And good-bye.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.438
Ah!

19:02.307 --> 19:04.509
Oh, my god,
I want to do this
for, like, five hours.

19:07.779 --> 19:09.447
All right,
all right.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.849
- That was awesome.
- <i>That was so cool.</i>

19:13.486 --> 19:15.353
Reedus:
<i>I could seriously ride</i>
<i>these dunes forever,</i>

19:15.355 --> 19:17.321
<i>But we've got miles</i>
<i>of highway in front of us.</i>

19:17.323 --> 19:18.756
- Man: <i>Was it good? </i>
<i>- Reedus:</i> <i>Oh, it was rad.</i>

19:18.758 --> 19:20.825
- Any time.
- Thanks, man.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.227
Reedus:
<i>So it's time to get off</i>
<i>the beach and back on the road.</i>

19:25.230 --> 19:27.465
Man:
<i>It's basically a place</i>
<i>built out of junk.</i>

19:27.467 --> 19:29.634
There's stuff in here
from, like, the '30s, '40s,

19:29.636 --> 19:31.669
- <i>Up until the '80s. </i>
<i>- Lehtonen:</i> <i>Wow.</i>

19:31.671 --> 19:35.306
- This is from
"the walking dead."
- that's rad.

19:35.308 --> 19:38.342
- This bike
is running right now.
- Wait, it's running right now?

19:38.344 --> 19:40.444
- It's running right now.
- Shut up.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.752
- Let's do it.
-  <i>All right, all right,</i>
<i>all right.</i>

19:47.754 --> 19:49.253
You look so cool.

19:49.255 --> 19:51.255
You're a ninja
right now.

19:51.257 --> 19:52.957
Yeah, dune buggies
are awesome.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.660
Yeah, dude.
I had no idea
it was that much fun.

19:55.662 --> 19:58.829
I feel like
I've gained weight in
my palms on this trip.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.798
My palms have
become meaty.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.268
Like, whacking your hands
on the steering wheel

20:04.270 --> 20:06.704
I think makes them swell
'cause my rings are all
real tight.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.239
Yeah, I couldn't get
the thing on my thing.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.674
That's why I put
the thing on your thing.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.576
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.578
- Know what I'm saying?
- Know what I'm saying?

20:16.382 --> 20:19.383
Reedus:
<i>We've ridden 200 miles</i>
<i>with another 50 to go tonight.</i>

20:19.385 --> 20:21.852
<i>And this next leg</i>
<i>of the ride is magical.</i>

20:21.854 --> 20:26.557
Wow, california
sunset right there.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.859
Reedus:
<i>See, that's one thing I don't</i>
<i>get to see in new york,</i>

20:28.861 --> 20:32.463
<i>An ocean sunset</i>
<i>that rolls over the waves</i>
<i>to the end of the world.</i>

20:38.270 --> 20:40.338
- So beautiful.
- So beautiful.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.542
Reedus:
<i>When I first got to la,</i>
<i>I worked at a harley shop</i>

20:44.544 --> 20:46.744
<i>Called dr. Carl's</i>
<i>hog hospital.</i>

20:46.746 --> 20:49.347
<i>I did a lot of grunt work,</i>

20:49.349 --> 20:52.350
<i>But on the plus side,</i>
<i>I got to see a lot</i>
<i>of different bikes.</i>

20:52.352 --> 20:55.886
<i>Back then, I always wondered</i>
<i>what it would be like to ride</i>
<i>up the california coast.</i>

20:55.888 --> 20:58.456
<i>And this is exactly</i>
<i>how I pictured it.</i>

21:04.363 --> 21:05.529
I start to daydream.

21:05.531 --> 21:06.931
I just start like, "ah."

21:06.933 --> 21:09.667
I have addddddd.
You know what I mean?

21:09.669 --> 21:12.403
no.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.338
- Reedus: <i>Good-bye, sun. </i>
<i>-</i> <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

21:14.340 --> 21:18.476
- <i>Feel the cold creeping in. </i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

21:18.478 --> 21:20.978
Reedus:
<i>It sounds like</i>
<i>a tornado right now.</i>

21:20.980 --> 21:23.547
I can't hear
what you're saying,
but I'm happy.

21:23.549 --> 21:24.949
I can't hear
what you're saying.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.621
Lehtonen:
<i>Is that an abandoned house?</i>

21:30.623 --> 21:32.490
Yeah, it looks like it.

21:33.558 --> 21:35.826
That looks amazing.
Can we go in there?

21:38.530 --> 21:39.497
What the hell?

21:39.499 --> 21:43.034
- How you guys doing?
- How you doing, man?
Norman. Hi.

21:43.036 --> 21:45.403
- Pretty good.
My name's mike.
- Nice to meet you, mike.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.672
Reedus:
<i>California is full of weird</i>
<i>tourist attractions</i>

21:47.674 --> 21:50.374
<i>Like nitt witt ridge</i>
<i>in the small town of cambria.</i>

21:51.877 --> 21:53.577
The man who built
this place,

21:53.579 --> 21:55.780
His name was actually
art beal,

21:55.782 --> 21:58.049
But they gave him a couple
colorful nicknames,

21:58.051 --> 21:59.817
And one of them
was captain nitwit.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.553
- Oh, wow.
- He started building
in 1928.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.922
He lived in this place
till 1989,

22:04.924 --> 22:06.557
Till he was
92 years old.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.626
Lehtonen:
<i>Wow.</i>

22:15.467 --> 22:17.835
- Lehtonen:
<i>I love all the stonework. </i>
<i>- Yeah, that's cool.</i>

22:17.837 --> 22:19.570
- See all these handrails?
- Yeah.

22:19.572 --> 22:21.706
This was
the plumbing system.
They all carried water.

22:21.708 --> 22:24.709
There's handrails
throughout the whole property.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.911
He also had a lot
of toilet seats,

22:26.913 --> 22:29.747
Which he would actually
use for picture frames.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.482
oh, my god.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.017
He called this
his woman's room.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.752
- What the?
- Wait, who are you?

22:34.754 --> 22:36.787
Like, how are you
involved here?

22:36.789 --> 22:40.725
My wife and I
bought this in 1999 from
the art beal foundation.

22:40.727 --> 22:43.461
I thought
I'd give the anti-hearst
castle tour.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.896
William randolph hearst
built this place in 1919

22:45.898 --> 22:47.832
<i>Out of his massive</i>
<i>amounts of money,</i>

22:47.834 --> 22:50.501
And this is the anti.
This guy was a garbage
man in town

22:50.503 --> 22:52.136
That took all
the garbage from town...

22:52.138 --> 22:54.038
Oh, so he collected garbage
and put this together from it?

22:54.040 --> 22:56.107
He got paid
as a garbage man.

22:56.109 --> 22:58.576
But now watch your head
and I'll take you
up this stairway.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.544
Art claimed this stairway
stayed 50 degrees.

23:00.546 --> 23:03.514
- This was his refrigerator.
- I feel the chill in here.
It is colder.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.616
- That's his stuff.
- What is that?

23:05.618 --> 23:07.852
There's peaches,
there's apricots.

23:07.854 --> 23:12.456
There's stuff in here
from, like, the '30s,
'40s, up until the '80s.

23:12.458 --> 23:16.127
This is so crazy.
I'm so happy we found
this place.

23:16.129 --> 23:18.562
As you guys can see,
his clothes are still
in here.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.798
Mike:
<i>People said half the time</i>

23:20.800 --> 23:22.466
<i>All he'd be wearing</i>
<i>is this bathrobe</i>

23:22.468 --> 23:23.868
<i>With nothing else</i>
<i>on under it,</i>

23:23.870 --> 23:26.904
They tell me he got older
and it'd get windy.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.639
- Oh, my god.

23:28.641 --> 23:31.642
And this is
his two-seated outhouse.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.778
He said he put
his and her toilets in here.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.981
He could sit here and have
conversations with people.

23:36.983 --> 23:41.051
He thought he was a swinger,
but then he never had kids.

23:41.053 --> 23:43.687
- He has no family?
- And he never had any family.

23:43.689 --> 23:45.890
I thought by now,
after 15 years
I've been up here,

23:45.892 --> 23:48.726
"I'm his grandkid.
I'm his--" no.
It's weird.

23:48.728 --> 23:51.195
But he liked ladies,
and ladies liked him.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.664
- He's, like, an enigma.
- He's kind of a romantic.

23:53.666 --> 23:56.000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.569
Mike:
And then a guy
with no family or anything

23:58.571 --> 24:01.839
Created his own legacy
with nothing but junk.

24:01.841 --> 24:05.075
Reedus:
<i>This dude literally built his</i>
<i>whole life into these walls.</i>

24:05.077 --> 24:07.511
<i>Coming up with a way to turn</i>
<i>trash into treasure.</i>

24:07.513 --> 24:08.979
There's a toilet
on top of the roof.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.548
And people said
that's his throne.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.516
He's the king
of the castle up there.

24:12.518 --> 24:13.818
Reedus:
<i>Even toilet seats.</i>

24:13.820 --> 24:15.085
Thank you for showing
us all of this.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.821
- Take care, man.
- Yeah, you, too.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.722
Reedus:
<i>This is just the kind</i>
<i>of wacky stuff</i>

24:18.724 --> 24:20.090
<i>I've been expecting to see</i>
<i>since we crossed</i>

24:20.092 --> 24:22.660
<i>From southern</i>
<i>to northern california.</i>

24:22.662 --> 24:26.163
<i>And just a couple miles away</i>
<i>from where we're going</i>
<i>to call it a night.</i>

24:26.165 --> 24:28.165
Bye, cool house.

24:30.769 --> 24:32.736
<i>"swing" playing</i>

24:32.738 --> 24:36.740
<i>♪ everyone is seeing</i>
<i>that I'm something else ♪</i>

24:38.643 --> 24:42.112
<i>♪ I'm not living</i>
<i>on somebody's shelf... ♪</i>

24:43.648 --> 24:45.249
Reedus:
<i>Day three.</i>

24:45.251 --> 24:47.618
<i>There's nothing better</i>
<i>than waking up in big sur,</i>

24:47.620 --> 24:50.187
<i>Home of the bixby bridge.</i>

24:50.189 --> 24:54.925
<i>260 feet high</i>
<i>and 700 feet long,</i>

24:54.927 --> 24:57.094
<i>This bridge is a beast.</i>

24:57.096 --> 25:01.131
<i>One of the tallest</i>
<i>single span concrete</i>
<i>bridges in the world.</i>

25:02.834 --> 25:05.536
<i>And finally,</i>
<i>after 400 miles,</i>

25:05.538 --> 25:07.805
<i>We're here in santa cruz.</i>

25:09.174 --> 25:11.008
<i>Santa cruz is a little</i>
<i>town tucked between</i>

25:11.010 --> 25:13.878
<i>The pacific</i>
<i>and the santa cruz mountains.</i>

25:13.880 --> 25:16.780
I just like the way
the air smells up here.
It's so clean.

25:16.782 --> 25:19.016
Reedus:
<i>Surrounded by incredible</i>
<i>natural beauty,</i>

25:19.018 --> 25:21.986
<i>And with a close proximity</i>
<i>to the san francisco</i>
<i>counterculture</i>

25:21.988 --> 25:23.888
<i>And silicon valley</i>
<i>tech scenes,</i>

25:23.890 --> 25:26.223
<i>It's the perfect spot</i>
<i>for anyone coming to california</i>

25:26.225 --> 25:28.058
<i>Looking for reinvention.</i>

25:28.060 --> 25:30.127
- Look at that crazy house.
- Yeah, that's beautiful.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.862
It's got a nice
eclectic feel.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.764
I hate when cities
start taking over

25:33.766 --> 25:36.166
And making everything
look the same.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.802
Reedus:
<i>We're here to drop in</i>
<i>on a local podcast.</i>

25:38.804 --> 25:41.005
<i>But first, we're headed</i>
<i>to zero motorcycles,</i>

25:41.007 --> 25:44.208
<i>A pioneer manufacturer</i>
<i>of electric motorcycles.</i>

25:44.210 --> 25:46.277
- Are these electric?
- Lehtonen: <i>Oh, cool.</i>

25:46.279 --> 25:49.813
For some reason
I imagined them looking
all crazy different.

25:49.815 --> 25:52.216
Reedus:
<i>California is a hotbed</i>
<i>of environmental action.</i>

25:52.218 --> 25:54.318
<i>So it makes sense that they</i>
<i>made their home here.</i>

25:54.320 --> 25:56.921
- Ready to check this out?
- Yeah.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.022
I used to have
a dog named zero.

25:58.024 --> 26:01.091
Reedus:
<i>Zero's scot harden is gonna</i>
<i>show us their bikes</i>

26:01.093 --> 26:02.860
<i>And take us for a spin.</i>

26:02.862 --> 26:05.596
- Nice to meet you, too.
Welcome to zero.
- All right.

26:08.700 --> 26:12.269
All right,
let's go on back into
the belly of the beast.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.809
Harden:
<i>This is where all of</i>
<i>the main assembly is done.</i>

26:18.811 --> 26:20.644
Reedus:
<i>It's weird to go into</i>
<i>a motorcycle shop,</i>

26:20.646 --> 26:22.913
Building motorcycles,
and it's not loud.

26:22.915 --> 26:26.016
- It's just super
weird to me.
- Yeah.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.958
This is where
it all started
for zero.

26:33.960 --> 26:37.361
- This is the first electric
motorcycle ever built.
- It's like a dirt bike, right?

26:37.363 --> 26:41.732
It was kind of cross
between an overgrown mountain
bike and a motorcycle.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.133
I think it's cool.
I really like that one.

26:43.135 --> 26:46.036
Well, it was the idea
of what could we do

26:46.038 --> 26:49.974
To change the way the world
experiences motorcycles.

26:49.976 --> 26:53.077
What kind of bike did you
ride before you got into
electric motorcycles?

26:53.079 --> 26:55.646
I was a dirt bike rider.
I was born in las vegas,

26:55.648 --> 26:57.281
And I rode dirt bikes.

26:57.283 --> 27:00.217
<i>And then I started doing</i>
<i>all the big desert races.</i>

27:00.219 --> 27:04.188
<i>I kept taking on bigger</i>
<i>challenges in europe</i>
<i>and then africa.</i>

27:04.190 --> 27:07.391
Scariest moment in my life
on a bike was in senegal

27:07.393 --> 27:10.828
Going down these roads
at 80, 90, 100 miles an hour

27:10.830 --> 27:13.864
With these bushes that
are this tall on each side,

27:13.866 --> 27:17.301
And there's animals
running out in front of you.
Pigs and ostriches.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.169
You're just thinking,
"god, don't step out

27:19.171 --> 27:21.071
- In front of my front wheel."
- that's terrifying.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.674
It scared me to death.
I hit a cow at 80 miles
an hour.

27:23.676 --> 27:26.010
- You hit a cow?
- I've bounced off
the hoods of cars.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.411
- That would mess you up.
- <i>You are so lucky.</i>

27:27.413 --> 27:29.813
I could tell stories.

27:29.815 --> 27:32.416
How's it going, guys?
Do you guys all ride
electric bikes now?

27:32.418 --> 27:34.385
- Do you?
- I have ridden some before.

27:34.387 --> 27:36.654
- Yeah?
- I ride my own
motorcycles mostly.

27:36.656 --> 27:38.822
- What do you have?
- Got a harley and a couple
dirt bikes.

27:38.824 --> 27:41.191
Is that, like, the enemy,
or is it everybody loves
everything?

27:41.193 --> 27:43.027
Everybody loves everything
around here, yeah.

27:43.029 --> 27:45.396
- Have you gone on one yet?
- We're about to try one.

27:45.398 --> 27:47.031
Yeah? Sick, dude.
I hope you like it.

27:47.033 --> 27:48.732
Yeah, I'm excited.
Nice to meet you, dude.

27:48.734 --> 27:50.334
-  <i>Nice to meet you. </i>
<i>- Yeah, it's a pleasure.</i>

27:50.336 --> 27:52.770
- How's it going, man?
- Good. Since you're here.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.672
- Lehtonen: <i>Oh, my god. </i>
<i>- Uh-oh.</i>

27:54.674 --> 27:57.775
- No way.
- This is from
"the walking dead."

27:57.777 --> 27:59.710
- That's rad.
- So...

28:00.946 --> 28:02.980
- Big fan of yours.
- Thanks, man.

28:02.982 --> 28:06.450
Have you guys
ever thought about doing
an electric dune buggy?

28:06.452 --> 28:08.352
- I want a hat.
- All right.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.821
- Great frog!
- Whoo!

28:10.823 --> 28:14.892
I feel like
I'm the only person whose
never  seen this show.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.860
- I need to watch it.
- Get out of here right now.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.463
Bye, guys.
Go to work.

28:19.465 --> 28:22.332
- Go to work.
- Lehtonen: <i>Get back to work.</i>

28:22.334 --> 28:27.004
See what fits you best.
What's your favorite color?
What's your favorite flavor?

28:29.007 --> 28:30.741
Reedus:
<i>This is a straight up</i>
<i>dirt bike right here.</i>

28:30.743 --> 28:32.443
That's an off-road
trail bike, yeah.

28:32.445 --> 28:35.145
- I'm taking this one.
- This is the fxs.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.481
<i>This is the inner city</i>
<i>hooligan bike.</i>

28:37.483 --> 28:40.150
- <i>It's very lightweight. </i>
<i>- Lehtonen:</i> <i>It feels light.</i>

28:40.152 --> 28:42.119
Harden:
<i>It's only 290 pounds.</i>

28:42.121 --> 28:44.421
I think
you'll really like that one.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.056
All the stuff's where
you'd normally expect.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.958
- Your turn signal's here.
- Okay.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.060
Brake where you'd
normally expect it.
Foot brake.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.362
And then the last thing
you do to arm this thing

28:52.364 --> 28:54.965
- Is hit
the throttle switch.
- Okay.

28:54.967 --> 28:57.501
Now that means this bike
is running right now.

28:57.503 --> 29:00.938
- Wow.
Wait, so it's on already?
- It's running right now?

29:00.940 --> 29:03.841
- It's running right now.
- Shut up. Wow.

29:03.843 --> 29:06.376
- Wow.
- Away you go.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.846
- Ah!
- I think we've chosen
our weapons.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.881
- Let's go out
and give them a whirl.
- All right.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.850
- All right?
- Cool.

29:12.852 --> 29:15.819
I can't believe that
that was running while
we were standing there.

29:17.756 --> 29:18.956
Reedus:
<i>It's weird getting</i>
<i>on a bike</i>

29:18.958 --> 29:20.891
<i>And not knowing</i>
<i>how it's gonna feel,</i>

29:20.893 --> 29:23.360
<i>But that's what I love about</i>
<i>trying out new bikes.</i>

29:23.362 --> 29:26.163
- Harden: <i>Are we ready? </i>
<i>- I think so.</i>

29:26.165 --> 29:27.364
Reedus:
<i>Scot's taking us up to see</i>

29:27.366 --> 29:30.100
<i>The legendary</i>
<i>california redwoods.</i>

29:30.102 --> 29:31.335
Whoa.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.537
- This is so crazy.
- Yeah, this is nuts.

29:33.539 --> 29:37.007
Reedus: <i>It's gonna be</i>
<i>the perfect way to find out</i>
<i>what the zero is all about.</i>

29:37.009 --> 29:39.843
I'm just--
this is blowing me
away how smooth this is.

29:41.045 --> 29:43.947
It's like your ass
is sliding on ice.

29:48.286 --> 29:50.053
Lehtonen:
<i>Let's go in the back,</i>
<i>and I will get your ring</i>

29:50.055 --> 29:51.522
<i>A final polish.</i>

29:53.358 --> 29:55.559
Reedus:
<i>Why is your</i>
<i>jack daniel's green?</i>

29:55.561 --> 29:57.427
Smell it.
Don't smell it too strong.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.897
Don't put your nose
too close to it.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.199
Oh, wow. Wow.
Don't drink that.

30:02.201 --> 30:05.169
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah.

30:05.171 --> 30:08.572
What is this?
This weird sort of
gerbil killer thing.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.574
This is awesome.
This is my polishing
machine.

30:10.576 --> 30:13.544
I used to have a polishing
machine without this

30:13.546 --> 30:17.014
So if the machine
caught the ring somehow,

30:17.016 --> 30:20.184
I'd get, like, a hot
ring flown in my face
or in my cleavage.

30:20.186 --> 30:23.053
- This is good.
- So that protects me.
Or you'd get dirt--

30:23.055 --> 30:26.190
"hot ring in my cleavage."
that sounds like a song.

30:26.192 --> 30:28.258
- Let's see.
-             Now we're            skull buddies, dude.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.893
Are we skull--
where's your skull?

30:29.895 --> 30:31.161
I got one there
and one there.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.863
- Boom, boom, boom.
- And one here.

30:32.865 --> 30:34.832
- Yeah.
-  <i>Cool.</i>

30:43.474 --> 30:45.976
Santa cruz redwoods.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.845
- Hi.
-         - Oh,!

30:47.847 --> 30:49.446
I just creeped
up on you and you
had no idea.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.882
No, I didn't.
I was like,
"where's norman?"

30:55.019 --> 30:57.254
Reedus:
<i>Sometimes I get on a bike</i>
<i>just to escape.</i>

30:57.256 --> 30:59.223
<i>The roar of the motorcycle</i>
<i>creates this wall</i>

30:59.225 --> 31:02.226
<i>Between me</i>
<i>and my surroundings.</i>

31:02.228 --> 31:06.129
- It smells really fresh.
- It does.

31:06.131 --> 31:07.531
- Healthy and green
up here.
- Like mossy.

31:11.102 --> 31:14.037
Reedus:
<i>That's what makes being</i>
<i>on this bike so strange.</i>

31:14.039 --> 31:15.505
<i>There's no wall.</i>

31:15.507 --> 31:19.243
<i>It's just you and the world</i>
<i>feeding off of each other.</i>

31:20.245 --> 31:23.647
I mean, it's perfect really
for, like, going through
this beautiful forest.

31:23.649 --> 31:26.516
You're just
kind of gliding.

31:26.518 --> 31:29.319
I kind of feel like
this is the future.

31:29.321 --> 31:33.123
- I really do.
- Yeah, imagine in, like,
50 or 100 years

31:33.125 --> 31:36.426
When, like, cities
are smogged up, everything
will be electric.

31:41.966 --> 31:45.035
Whee!
This is crazy 'cause
I can't see the bike.

31:45.037 --> 31:46.536
Does it feel like
you're flying?

31:46.538 --> 31:49.439
- Yeah, it does.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.675
Reedus:
And there's nothing like riding
<i>it through the redwoods.</i>

31:51.677 --> 31:53.143
<i>You should try it.</i>

31:53.145 --> 31:57.047
Amazing.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.483
Harden:
<i>Go to sport!</i>

31:59.485 --> 32:01.585
Whoa!

32:01.587 --> 32:03.520
<i>Whoa!</i>

32:03.522 --> 32:05.088
Have you put it
in sport mode?

32:05.090 --> 32:06.590
Yeah, dude,
it's like, oh, my god.

32:06.592 --> 32:09.660
- It's terrifying.
- Lehtonen: <i>All right.</i>

32:09.662 --> 32:12.930
Whoa! Whoa!
I put it in sport.
It's crazy.

32:12.932 --> 32:17.034
You feel the extra tug.
It's like, whaa!

32:17.036 --> 32:19.169
I swallowed
my adam's apple
for a second.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.607
- It was great
riding with your guys.
- You're awesome.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.176
- Thank you so much, scot.
- Imogen, it was really
nice meeting you.

32:26.178 --> 32:29.179
- I want an electric
motorcycle now.
- Yeah, me, too.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.181
We got more converts.
That's cool.

32:31.183 --> 32:32.950
Cool.

32:35.486 --> 32:36.987
Yeah, of course.

32:38.623 --> 32:39.957
Yeah, tell me.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.992
This belonged to
my late brother chris.

32:41.994 --> 32:44.161
He was a huge,
huge fan of yours.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.430
Used to have posters
of you guys up in the room
and everything.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.632
- Oh, man.
- He loved you guys a lot.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.968
And this was actually
in the wreck with him.

32:50.970 --> 32:53.203
- That's why it's all
mangled like this.
- Oh, dude.

32:53.205 --> 32:55.138
I wanted to see
if you could sign it.
It would mean the world to me.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.274
Come here. Come here.
Yeah, dude.

32:57.276 --> 33:00.477
- Thanks, man.
- Of course.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.612
- Sign it to chris
if you would.
- To chris.

33:02.614 --> 33:04.715
Of course, man.

33:12.024 --> 33:15.692
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, dude. Yeah.
Be well, dude.

33:15.694 --> 33:18.695
- Ride on.
- Yeah. Take care, man.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.397
- <i>Later. </i>
<i>- Bye.</i>

33:23.735 --> 33:27.704
Reedus:
<i>Hearing something like that</i>
<i>just rips me to shreds.</i>

33:27.706 --> 33:30.340
<i>Reminds me that life</i>
<i>is fragile.</i>

33:30.342 --> 33:31.675
<i>I'm honored that I got</i>
<i>to meet that guy</i>

33:31.677 --> 33:33.176
<i>And hear</i>
<i>his brother's story.</i>

33:33.178 --> 33:34.745
<i>Ride on, brother.</i>

33:34.747 --> 33:36.246
Lehtonen:
<i>This is a pretty town.</i>
<i>I like it.</i>

33:36.248 --> 33:38.281
Yeah, it's really
cute here.

33:38.283 --> 33:40.250
Reedus:
<i>You know, santa cruz has</i>
<i>some really cool streets.</i>

33:40.252 --> 33:42.019
This is cool.
Look at this wall.

33:42.021 --> 33:43.587
Reedus:
<i>So it's nice to get off</i>
<i>our bikes</i>

33:43.589 --> 33:45.288
<i>And check out the details</i>
<i>we might have missed</i>

33:45.290 --> 33:46.556
<i>When we're riding by it.</i>

33:46.558 --> 33:49.192
Hi.
Oh, shut up, hi.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.527
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you, too.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.029
- Congratulations.
- Do you live up here?

33:52.031 --> 33:53.797
- Yes, this is where I live.
- Shut up.

33:53.799 --> 33:56.666
- You guys know each other?
- Shut up. How are you, dude?

33:56.668 --> 34:00.470
Nice to see you, sweetheart.
Yeah, what a pleasure.

34:00.472 --> 34:04.174
That lady that just said hi,
she was a director on
"walking dead."

34:04.176 --> 34:07.544
- What a small world.
Santa cruz.
- She's awesome.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.346
Still have to watch it.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.248
I'm gonna send
you every disc.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.816
- Okay.
- Then I'll send you
like a little--

34:12.818 --> 34:16.086
You'll have to write
an essay or something.

34:16.088 --> 34:19.756
How did you get started
riding motorcycles?

34:19.758 --> 34:24.795
I used to hitch a ride
on the back of his bike
to university and to work.

34:24.797 --> 34:27.831
He had a bmw dakar
dual-sport thing,

34:27.833 --> 34:29.399
And I would jump on
the back of that.

34:29.401 --> 34:33.170
And now it's carried on

34:33.172 --> 34:35.072
As the inspiration
as to why I love to ride.

34:35.074 --> 34:36.606
It's because of my dad.

34:36.608 --> 34:39.576
He died, like, a year
and a half ago.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.578
So whenever I ride,
it's like...

34:41.580 --> 34:44.581
- My special time.
- Yeah.

34:44.583 --> 34:47.517
That cross-country
trip was, like, the one-year
anniversary of his death.

34:47.519 --> 34:51.621
- I remember.
- So it was very, very special
thing to have happen.

34:51.623 --> 34:55.192
I like how your family--
you pass the torch from--

34:55.194 --> 34:57.461
Like how you do your rings
and the store.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.296
- Unintentionally, but, yes.
- It's great.

34:59.298 --> 35:02.499
People don't have that.
It's great.

35:02.501 --> 35:05.202
I like that they have
shrubberies everywhere.

35:05.204 --> 35:09.206
- Do you like monty python?
- Oh, my god, I love
monty python.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.508
"monty python and the holy
grail" is my favorite
movie of all time.

35:11.510 --> 35:12.876
- With the little rabbit?
- Yeah.

35:12.878 --> 35:14.811
It goes after
his throat.

35:14.813 --> 35:17.347
- "we are the knights
that say ni."
- exactly.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.189
It's nice to be back
on my own bike.

35:26.191 --> 35:30.627
Kind of like the rumble,
but those bikes were cool,
I got to say.

35:30.629 --> 35:33.497
I like how he said, too,
he's not trying to replace
other motorcycles.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.899
-  <i>It's just another</i>
<i>experience, you know? </i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

35:35.901 --> 35:38.635
Reedus:
<i>Last stop, and I couldn't</i>
<i>be more excited.</i>

35:38.637 --> 35:41.271
<i>We're headed over</i>
<i>to the re-cycle garage...</i>

35:41.273 --> 35:42.572
I like santa cruz.

35:42.574 --> 35:43.907
<i>...Home of this really</i>
<i>cool podcast</i>

35:43.909 --> 35:46.576
<i>Called "motorcycles</i>
<i>& misfits."</i>

35:46.578 --> 35:48.178
<i>Who doesn't like</i>
<i>geeking out on bikes</i>

35:48.180 --> 35:49.646
<i>With a bunch of misfits?</i>

35:51.782 --> 35:55.352
Welcome to
"motorcycles & misfits"
at the re-cycle garage.

35:55.354 --> 35:58.255
- You guys are getting
all batman on me and stuff.

35:58.257 --> 36:01.391
What's the best bike for
the zombie apocalypse?

36:01.393 --> 36:03.760
I'm gonna tell you,
and you're not gonna
like my answer.

36:16.908 --> 36:18.808
Reedus:
<i>Wow, I love it up here,</i>
<i>I got to tell you.</i>

36:18.810 --> 36:20.911
Lehtonen:
<i>Love it.</i>

36:20.913 --> 36:23.446
Northern california
is so much different
than southern california.

36:23.448 --> 36:27.184
- It's different, yeah.
- It's such a different energy.
You know what I mean?

36:27.186 --> 36:29.853
Reedus:
<i>My first big california</i>
<i>ride is winding down.</i>

36:29.855 --> 36:31.521
<i>But first, imogen and I</i>
<i>are gonna make</i>

36:31.523 --> 36:34.824
<i>One final pit stop</i>
<i>at the re-cycle garage</i>

36:34.826 --> 36:36.893
<i>Where a bunch of local bikers</i>
<i>put on one of the coolest</i>

36:36.895 --> 36:40.497
<i>Weekly podcasts</i>
<i>on the west coast.</i>

36:40.499 --> 36:44.334
<i>It's called</i>
<i>"motorcycles & misfits."</i>

36:44.336 --> 36:45.368
- Hello.
- What's up? Hi.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.703
- I'm norman.
- Liza.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.605
- Nice to meet you. Hi.
- Hi. Imogen.

36:48.607 --> 36:50.207
- Hey, imogen.
- Nice to meet you.

36:50.209 --> 36:52.742
These are some nice
little rides you got.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.679
This is a little bit
nicer version than mine,
but you know.

36:55.681 --> 36:57.847
- This is awesome, though.
That's beautiful.
- Thank you.

36:57.849 --> 36:59.883
- <i>I built that one. </i>
<i>-</i> <i>Did you really?</i>
<i>Right on.</i>

36:59.885 --> 37:03.920
Do you teach people that
don't know how to work on
bikes how to work on bikes?

37:03.922 --> 37:05.722
Yes, but nobody here
is a mechanic.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.458
- Oh, wow.
- <i>Everyone helps each other</i>
<i>work on bikes.</i>

37:08.460 --> 37:11.528
We teach people how to ride,
help them buy their gear,

37:11.530 --> 37:15.265
Teach them what are
the cool movies to watch.

37:15.267 --> 37:18.268
Expose them
to the entire culture.

37:18.270 --> 37:22.005
- How cool.
- Yeah, so we've kind of built
up this crazy community.

37:22.007 --> 37:25.308
Lehtonen:
I like that you have such
an eclectic mix of bikes here.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.911
- Liza: <i>Hey, if they can ride,</i>
<i>we'll let them in. </i>
<i>-</i>  <i>How did the podcast start?</i>

37:27.913 --> 37:30.413
When you get
a group of people sitting
around the garage

37:30.415 --> 37:32.649
<i>Working on bikes,</i>
<i>you have conversations.</i>

37:32.651 --> 37:35.819
<i>We play pranks,</i>
<i>we tell stories,</i>
<i>we share rides</i>

37:35.821 --> 37:37.621
<i>And experiences</i>
<i>and opinions.</i>

37:37.623 --> 37:39.489
Wow, that's so cool.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.825
So we thought,
"how can we bottle this

37:41.827 --> 37:45.629
<i>And share it with everyone?</i>
<i>Podcast."</i>

37:45.631 --> 37:48.431
- We're ready.
- Check, one, two.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.267
- <i>Microphone check. </i>
<i>- Oh, oh, oh, oh.</i>

37:50.269 --> 37:54.437
<i>We are gonna go in </i>
<i>five, four, three...</i>

37:56.340 --> 37:58.875
Hey, there. Welcome to
"motorcycles & misfits"

37:58.877 --> 38:01.645
At the re-cycle garage
here in...

38:01.647 --> 38:04.648
All:
...Sunny santa cruz,
california.

38:04.650 --> 38:07.784
- Warm and sunny.
- <i>It was quite sunny.</i>

38:07.786 --> 38:09.953
Liza:
Let's get to one
of our topics.

38:09.955 --> 38:13.723
What's the best bike
for the zombie apocalypse?

38:13.725 --> 38:16.760
And we have
a special guest here.

38:16.762 --> 38:19.663
Somebody who actually has
experience in this field,

38:19.665 --> 38:22.465
And I want to get
their opinion.

38:22.467 --> 38:25.735
So I'd like to welcome
here norman reedus.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.537
What's up? What's up?
What's up?

38:27.539 --> 38:30.740
- Hi, thanks for having me.
- Hey, dude. Welcome.

38:30.742 --> 38:33.543
I'm gonna tell you,
and I think you're not
gonna like my answer.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.945
- Oh, yeah?
- <i>I think what I would do</i>

38:35.947 --> 38:37.881
Is I'd get one
of these zero bikes,

38:37.883 --> 38:40.550
And I would put a solar panel
on the back of it.

38:42.354 --> 38:44.954
'cause anything that makes
noise attracts zombies.

38:44.956 --> 38:47.424
- <i>Right. </i>
<i>- Right? And I caught</i>
<i>  a lot of flack</i>

38:47.426 --> 38:50.427
For having that triumph
with the ape hangers.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.362
I caught a lot of flack,
and then I built another bike,

38:52.364 --> 38:55.565
Miraculously in, like,
six hours on that show.

38:55.567 --> 38:59.469
And I get a lot of flack
because that one makes
a lot of noise as well.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.538
How did you come
to have that bike?

39:01.540 --> 39:03.473
That's supposed
to be merle's bike.

39:03.475 --> 39:07.510
Did he customize
the frame up that high?

39:07.512 --> 39:08.912
I guess.
I don't know.
What the?

39:08.914 --> 39:11.448
- Um...

39:11.450 --> 39:14.718
- So I would like
to make some suggestions.
- Uh-oh, here we go.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.754
First you should consider
an anti-theft device
of some kind.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.489
- Oh, I like it.
- Just saying.

39:19.491 --> 39:22.125
Second, more mirrors,
I would suggest.

39:22.127 --> 39:25.362
It would be nice
to maybe see something
coming up behind you.

39:25.364 --> 39:26.596
Yeah, I-- yeah.

39:26.598 --> 39:29.466
Lastly, a machine gun
on the front

39:29.468 --> 39:32.602
Because what bike
isn't cooler with a machine
gun on the front?

39:32.604 --> 39:34.671
Yeah, we've thought
about attaching weapons
to that thing.

39:34.673 --> 39:36.473
You could just drill
a hole in your exhaust

39:36.475 --> 39:38.108
And squirt some soap
in it and make a smokescreen.

39:38.110 --> 39:40.009
You guys are getting
all batman on me and stuff.

39:41.446 --> 39:43.613
How's motorcycling
changed you?

39:43.615 --> 39:47.817
Like, I ride to work
every day and I think about
what I'm about to do

39:47.819 --> 39:49.486
And it really gets me
in the mood.

39:49.488 --> 39:52.889
And then I ride home.
I think about what I did.

39:52.891 --> 39:55.925
I don't know.
It's almost like yoga
or something at some point.

39:55.927 --> 39:57.861
- You know what I mean?
- Lehtonen: <i>It's therapeutic.</i>

39:57.863 --> 40:00.163
Reedus:
<i>The best rides I think</i>
<i>are the spontaneous ones.</i>

40:00.165 --> 40:02.832
I gave an award at the country
music awards in nashville

40:02.834 --> 40:04.834
When I was down in georgia
and, you know,

40:04.836 --> 40:06.569
They booked
me a flight to go there
and everything.

40:06.571 --> 40:08.171
And I'm sitting there
watering my plants

40:08.173 --> 40:09.973
And I'm looking at my bike,
and I'm watering my plants,

40:09.975 --> 40:12.776
And I said, " it."
and I grabbed the suit,

40:12.778 --> 40:16.513
I shoved it in a backpack,
wrote all my directions
on my arm.

40:16.515 --> 40:19.449
And then I kept going
through rainstorms, and I just
kept losing them.

40:19.451 --> 40:21.651
<i>But that ride to nashville</i>
<i>is one of my favorites.</i>

40:23.855 --> 40:26.523
Is your dog snoring right now?
Is that what that was?

40:26.525 --> 40:29.025
Oh, my god,
that's adorable.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.627
Liza:
<i>Thank you, everyone,</i>
<i>for listening,</i>

40:30.629 --> 40:32.529
And thank you guys
for joining us.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.731
Lehtonen:
<i>You guys are so much fun.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

40:34.733 --> 40:36.866
I was looking for a group
ride when I first moved here,

40:36.868 --> 40:38.668
And I ran into zach.

40:38.670 --> 40:42.906
He had a crappy
motorcycle

40:42.908 --> 40:44.641
But a nice jacket,
so I asked him--

40:44.643 --> 40:47.510
I was like,
"so where's the ride?"

40:47.512 --> 40:50.013
And I asked him
if they could show me
how to change my oil.

40:50.015 --> 40:53.016
- And this is where
we are now.
- Yeah.

40:53.018 --> 40:56.653
- That was three years ago.
- Nice.

40:56.655 --> 40:58.888
When I fist showed up,
liza just shoved a broken
moped at me

40:58.890 --> 41:00.123
And was like,
"here, fix this."

41:00.125 --> 41:02.492
She does that
to a lot of people.

41:02.494 --> 41:04.661
That's how she hooks you in.
She's like, "oh, here's
this free bike.

41:04.663 --> 41:06.196
Just get it running
and it's yours."

41:06.198 --> 41:08.832
- And two years later,
I was still here.
- That's cool.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.733
And she's all,
"hey, dad," when she was 13,

41:10.735 --> 41:12.969
"I want to ride motorcycles."
I'm all, "hell, no."

41:12.971 --> 41:16.139
And she's like,
"whatever. I'll be 18 someday."
I'm like, "ugh, yeah."

41:16.141 --> 41:18.107
So you guys
are father and daughter?
That is so cool.

41:18.109 --> 41:20.477
Yeah, so then I started
hanging around.

41:20.479 --> 41:21.845
And then
I just got hooked.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.713
<i>You guys all know</i>
<i>what it's like.</i>

41:23.715 --> 41:25.181
<i>You hop on the bike,</i>
<i>you're rolling the throttle,</i>

41:25.183 --> 41:27.016
- And everything melts away.
- Yeah.

41:30.055 --> 41:32.121
Liza:
<i>So we're chasing the sun.</i>

41:32.123 --> 41:36.493
- Let's saddle up
and do a quick ride.
- Shall we hit it?

41:36.495 --> 41:39.696
<i>Surrounded by a bunch</i>
<i>of outsiders.</i>

41:39.698 --> 41:41.631
<i>And california</i>
<i>is a magnet.</i>

41:41.633 --> 41:44.100
<i>It attracts people who don't</i>
<i>fit in anywhere else.</i>

41:44.102 --> 41:47.504
<i>Everyone's got a totally</i>
<i>different vibe here,</i>

41:47.506 --> 41:49.239
<i>But their love of bikes</i>
<i>ties them together,</i>

41:49.241 --> 41:51.140
<i>And I love that.</i>

41:51.142 --> 41:54.644
<i>And the misfits are doing</i>
<i>the rest of us a huge favor</i>

41:54.646 --> 41:57.747
<i>Bringing these unique bikes</i>
<i>back to life.</i>

41:57.749 --> 42:01.184
<i>That's the kind of passion</i>
<i>for motorcycles, for life,</i>

42:01.186 --> 42:04.988
<i>That has made my ride</i>
<i>up the california coast</i>
<i>so incredible.</i>

42:04.990 --> 42:09.659
<i>California is a place</i>
<i>where all of us misfits</i>
<i>can fit in.</i>

42:09.661 --> 42:11.628
<i>And sure, you're not gonna</i>
<i>find roads like the pch</i>

42:11.630 --> 42:14.097
<i>Anywhere else</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

42:14.099 --> 42:18.001
Liza:
<i>It's empowering to learn</i>
<i>how to do something.</i>

42:18.003 --> 42:19.936
If you can build
or fix something,

42:19.938 --> 42:22.939
What else can you do
in your life, you know?

42:22.941 --> 42:26.075
Reedus:
<i>But california is more than</i>
<i>just breathtaking beauty.</i>

42:26.077 --> 42:29.946
<i>The sense of rebellion</i>
<i>you find everywhere you go.</i>

42:29.948 --> 42:33.783
<i>The creativity.</i>
<i>The freedom to try</i>
<i>whatever the hell you want.</i>

42:33.785 --> 42:36.152
<i>That's the california</i>
<i>I found on this ride.</i>

42:36.154 --> 42:38.688
<i>And that's the california</i>
<i>I'm gonna keep coming back to</i>

42:38.690 --> 42:40.590
<i>For the rest of my life.</i>

42:40.592 --> 42:43.092
You guys are awesome.
I really love what you guys
have going here.

42:43.094 --> 42:44.127
This is really cool.

42:44.129 --> 42:45.728
- Bye, guys.
- Bye!

42:45.730 --> 42:47.730
- Bye. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.832
Thank you so much
for coming on this trip.

42:49.834 --> 42:51.668
- It's been a blast.
- You are very welcome.

42:51.670 --> 42:53.570
That was awesome.
Dune buggying.

42:53.572 --> 42:57.674
- Dune buggies, yes.
- Yes, and the coastline
and the sunsets.
