the boots off the corpses

up from above.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.817

it might swing a barrel by it.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.018
[digger] maybe.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.687
Give me up on your shoulders
and I'll get that for you.

04:15.689 --> 04:19.424
[ramsey] looks like
something's been eating
on that stiff arm.

04:19.426 --> 04:22.127
That little strong arm
ain't that strong no more.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.029

gonna count.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.431
-No.
-[ramsey] I'd love
to have it up there,

04:26.433 --> 04:28.567

08:36.917 --> 08:38.683
in the physical
sense, with me,

08:38.685 --> 08:42.287
jerry talked to me from
hospital to complete
this stuff

08:42.289 --> 08:44.256
and I'm taking these
24 bottles here

08:44.258 --> 08:45.857
to the wedding tonight.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.325
It would just mean
the world to me,

08:47.327 --> 08:48.994
for jerry to be there

08:48.996 --> 08:52.464
and be able to see people
enjoy the champagne.

08:52.466 --> 08:53.999
<i>  I've got a lot of pressure</i>
<i>  on me right now.</i>

08:54.001 --> 08:56.101
<i>  I'm getting married to</i>
<i>  the love of my life</i>

08:56.103 --> 09:00.805
<i>  and I've gotta try to get</i>
<i>  the other 24 bottles</i>
<i>  of this stuff sold.</i>

09:00.807 --> 09:03.041
<i>  Jerry's got a lot</i>
<i>  of medical bills,</i>

09:03.043 --> 09:05.443
<i>  I just wanna get some money</i>
<i>  back in jerry's pocket.</i>

09:18.692 --> 09:20.225
[ramsey] looky here, digger.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.794
Know what the three-legged
dog said when they went
in the saloon, don't you?

09:22.796 --> 09:26.031
[digger] yup, I'm looking for
the bandit that shot my paw.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.967
We're here at
the old ghost town

09:28.969 --> 09:30.802
on buck mountain
in maggie valley.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.038
Get and do your best
can-can dance.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.407
I'll sit here and shoot
my six shooter up.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.376
Mark and myself were in there
looking for anything
that we can repurpose

09:38.378 --> 09:39.277
in this place.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.646
<i>  So that we can</i>
<i>  mimic the sea aged</i>

09:41.648 --> 09:43.415
<i>  tennessee whisky here</i>
<i>  in the mountains.</i>

09:44.017 --> 09:45.584
<i>  You gotta have a saloon.</i>

09:45.586 --> 09:47.919
You gotta have a drain
in the middle of the floor

09:47.921 --> 09:50.488
to wash the puke and
the piss out the next day.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.695
Look out yonder, can you
tell how high we are?

09:56.697 --> 09:58.263
We kinda wanna view, puss.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.398
If you could jump, you can
make it right over yonder.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.100
[ramsey] ain't that pretty?

10:02.102 --> 10:03.501
You see right there,
why it's called

10:03.503 --> 10:05.070
the smoky mountains,
though, can't you?

10:05.072 --> 10:06.304
[digger] yup.

10:07.908 --> 10:11.843
Do you feel how much cooler it
got in the last ten minutes?

10:11.845 --> 10:13.378
It's all them poltergeists.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.046
There ain't no
damn poltergeist.

10:15.048 --> 10:18.016
Honestly, puss, every time
the sun goes down,

10:18.018 --> 10:20.352
behind the cloud,
the temperature changes.

10:20.354 --> 10:21.653
[digger] yeah.

10:21.655 --> 10:24.289
This is what we need,
this change in temperature,

10:24.291 --> 10:26.224
that's what forces the liquor

10:26.226 --> 10:28.093
in and out of
the wood on the barrel.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.894
Blue skies right there.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.129
Clouds over here.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.263
<i>  This is perfect.</i>

10:32.265 --> 10:34.866
The only thing we gotta
contend with is movement.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.267
It don't have to move a lot.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.970
They just need to move
four or five inches.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.939
[digger] well, let's look
around some more.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.141
[ramsey] we're going to find
a place to put them barrels.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.910
I tell you what we can do.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.913
We can look down there
to lower parking lot area,

10:48.915 --> 10:50.849
where that roller coaster was,

10:50.851 --> 10:53.084
might be something
to work with up there.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.890
I'm telling you,

10:58.892 --> 11:02.360
for its day, that roller
coaster was something else.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.065
[rogers] what kind of blade
you're carrying there?

11:07.067 --> 11:08.867
[amanda] oh, it's an
akonua buck knife.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.670
Was made the year I was born,
so it's my lucky knife.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.672
[rogers] it's a good
looking knife, sharp.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.078
So, I'm making,

11:20.080 --> 11:21.913
like, a hazelnut white rum.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.148
She impressed me pretty good

11:23.150 --> 11:25.016
on the way she
made the hazelnut.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.451
Amanda, buttery notes,

11:26.453 --> 11:28.520
the creamy notes,
it's wonderful.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.488
Amanda is the
next master distiller.

11:30.490 --> 11:31.756
[all applauding]

11:31.758 --> 11:33.091
we got to talking,

11:33.093 --> 11:35.894
<i>  she wants to learn little</i>
<i>  bit about the old ways</i>

11:35.896 --> 11:38.396
<i>  so I thought might do</i>
<i>  a little trading,</i>

11:38.398 --> 11:41.166
teach her how to do some
of the old things

11:41.168 --> 11:42.300
and she might show me

11:42.302 --> 11:43.968
something about
the new things.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.637
-Is this something
you guys made?
-[huck] yeah.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.272
-You wanna try some of that?
-[amanda] I'd love to.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.306
[huck] that's a
stone cold liquor.

11:48.308 --> 11:51.109
I started making liquor
about five years ago.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.877
I'll pour you a little
bit on that cup.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.012
[amanda] thank you.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.547
I basically, fell in
love with the craft

11:55.549 --> 11:56.848
<i>  through the history of it.</i>

11:56.850 --> 11:58.249
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.051
I'm fascinated by the lengths

12:00.053 --> 12:01.386
that the old timers
went through

12:01.388 --> 12:05.123
to just pay their bills and
take care of their families.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.859
The corn is perfect,
smooth, a little bit sweet.

12:07.861 --> 12:08.993
<i>  With mark and huck,</i>

12:08.995 --> 12:11.429
I feel like, I can really
get a good idea of

12:11.431 --> 12:12.997
how that's done still today.

12:12.999 --> 12:16.000
<i>  'cause they're still doing it</i>
<i>  in the old fashioned way.</i>

12:16.002 --> 12:17.469
[rogers] we'll help
you out all we can.

12:17.471 --> 12:20.171
But you can help us out
on real good flavor later.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.372
It'll sure help.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.308
I'll do my best, I'm pretty
good with playing with flavors

12:23.310 --> 12:25.777
and making liquor that
people like to drink.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.112
[rogers] I'll tell you what
we're gonna do,

12:27.114 --> 12:29.180
we're gonna start you
from the scratch,

12:29.182 --> 12:31.049
we're gonna show you
how to build a furnace.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.417
Early in the spring,

12:32.419 --> 12:34.352
<i>  people buy a whole</i>
<i>  lot of liquor.</i>

12:34.354 --> 12:37.155
So we'd set up
a good easy fix,

12:37.157 --> 12:38.690
you know, before we
get running quick.

12:38.692 --> 12:40.125
-We're gonna use clay.
-Clay.

12:40.127 --> 12:43.027
-You don't use cement,
it'll crack and bust.
-Yes.

12:43.029 --> 12:45.029
Clay is the best
thing you can use.

12:45.031 --> 12:47.298
<i>  Now, I thought it'd</i>
<i>  be a good time to</i>

12:47.300 --> 12:49.134
set us up a rock furnace.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.102
<i> It will help us on later runs.</i>

12:51.104 --> 12:52.203
I love playing with
modern rock,

12:52.205 --> 12:55.039
so I'm super excited about it.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.075
<i> [rogers] I'm getting some</i>
<i>  age on me now,</i>

12:57.077 --> 12:58.977
and amanda, she's young,

12:58.979 --> 13:01.312
<i>  we gotta teach her</i>
<i>  everything we can.</i>

13:01.314 --> 13:02.313
[huck] you'll see
it right there.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.915
This whole ridge is, like,

13:03.917 --> 13:05.850
dig down a little bit
past that topsoil,

13:05.852 --> 13:07.152
so we got good clay.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.888
We gotta keep this
moonshining going on,

13:09.890 --> 13:11.656
even when I'm gone,

13:11.658 --> 13:14.058
<i>  it still needs to</i>
<i>  keep it going.</i>

13:14.060 --> 13:15.827
You wanna do the sifting
or the shoveling?

13:15.829 --> 13:17.061
I'll shovel.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.497
-I'll get the buckets.
-All right.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.839
If you don't sift this
stuff out real good,

13:27.841 --> 13:30.108
you'll have them
big clumps in it.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.010
Can't get your rocks
to lay good,

13:32.012 --> 13:33.845
it's aggravating work.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.480
<i>  Clay, you know,</i>
<i>  is a real package,</i>

13:35.482 --> 13:36.347
<i>  the old timers,</i>

13:36.349 --> 13:38.283
that's what they used to

13:38.285 --> 13:39.984
<i>  chink the cracks</i>
<i>  in their log cabins</i>

13:39.986 --> 13:42.854
and lay the rock for their
chimney, you know.

13:42.856 --> 13:43.988
See, when you sift it out

13:43.990 --> 13:45.957
this about makes it
like powder.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.325
Then when you mix
a little water with it,

13:47.327 --> 13:49.060
you know, it'll be
just like glue.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.796
Amanda, what type
of still you got?

13:51.798 --> 13:53.965
[amanda] I have a 25
gallon copper pot.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.934
Mark and huck are on
a whole different scale

13:55.936 --> 13:57.068
to what I do at home.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.837
<i>  Volume, is something that I'm</i>

13:58.839 --> 14:00.305
<i>  really trying to</i>
<i>  increase right now</i>

14:00.307 --> 14:02.140
and they're experts at it.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.642
Yeah, I use a little
propane burner.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.244
And it could be...
The heat's direct,

14:06.246 --> 14:08.847
so I have to be really careful
about solids in the pot

14:08.849 --> 14:10.148
and scorching the mash.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.083
And that's another benefit
of doing a furnace

14:12.085 --> 14:14.118
'cause it's not
directly on the pot.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.421
You're more or less heating
the sides of the furnace.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.356
-Float them...
-Yeah.

14:19.893 --> 14:22.227
Amanda, I know she's
a good worker,

14:22.229 --> 14:24.696
<i>  she started in</i>
<i>  shoveling that clay</i>

14:24.698 --> 14:27.198
and I know we're in good
shape with her there,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.100
she ain't lazy,
I'll tell you that.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.869
That ought to be enough.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.670
[huck] so, then we'll teach
her how to build a furnace.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.883
[ramsey] if you can get
a barrel hanging out there,

14:44.885 --> 14:46.918
that will be the place for it,
it will swing.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.853
There's a lot of wind that
comes through here.

14:48.855 --> 14:51.256
It's a thought but I don't
think it will work.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.124
I mean, as much
as I'd love to have

14:53.126 --> 14:55.059
whisky barrels
hanging here...

14:55.061 --> 14:56.261
[digger] it ain't feasible.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.196
We'd have to hire a crane.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.964
[ramsey] and what if you
drop one of 'em,

14:59.966 --> 15:02.000
when you're trying
to hang it up.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.068
[digger] you would have
shot yourself in the foot.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.637
<i>  We don't have the</i>
<i>  equipment it'd take</i>

15:05.639 --> 15:08.039
<i>  to put barrels up</i>
<i>  on these rails here.</i>

15:08.041 --> 15:11.142
It's too far off the ground,
we can't do anything with it.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.977
We gotta study
about it a little bit,

15:12.979 --> 15:14.979
how to hoist it up and get it,

15:14.981 --> 15:16.581
get it hanging and moving.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.916
We gotta get it in motion.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.951
We're not gonna be here
babysitting these,

15:19.953 --> 15:21.686
there's no electricity
up here.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.187
<i>  We have to do it naturally</i>

15:23.189 --> 15:26.024
<i>  with the resources that</i>
<i>  mother nature provides.</i>

15:26.026 --> 15:28.326
Hey, puss. Dream catcher.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.062
Huh.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.298
[digger] looks more like
a nightmare to me.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.367
[ramsey] I don't ever
remember riding that. Do you?

15:36.369 --> 15:37.335
No, I don't.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.837
It may have
been put there later.

15:39.839 --> 15:43.241
[digger] looks like exactly
what I was thinking.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.976
[ramsey] let's see if we can--

15:44.978 --> 15:46.844
[digger] that hole there for
the exit, it'll hold a barrel.

15:46.846 --> 15:49.914
[ramsey] oh, my!

15:49.916 --> 15:52.650
The dream catcher's kinda
tilt the world up thing,

15:52.652 --> 15:54.419
it's got little seats that
on their own swivel

15:54.421 --> 15:56.187
<i>  and your chair swings out,</i>

15:56.189 --> 15:58.456
you know, the g-force
makes the chairs

15:58.458 --> 16:00.091
go out as they turn around.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.092
[grunts]

16:03.196 --> 16:04.162
hey.

16:05.498 --> 16:06.497
Look at this.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.468
This might be exactly
what we're looking for.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.937
<i> [ramsey] I can see barrels</i>

16:12.939 --> 16:15.673
<i>  in every one of these.</i>

16:27.153 --> 16:29.320
[mike] here we are, the
wedding day is here.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.688
Champagne's ready.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.391
The bride asked for it
and she got it.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.693
<i>  Me and jenna have been</i>
<i>  engaged for long damn time</i>

16:35.695 --> 16:37.095
<i>  but today is the big day,</i>

16:37.097 --> 16:38.796
<i> we're finally getting married.</i>

16:38.798 --> 16:40.665
<i>  You know, I've been</i>
<i>  married a few times before</i>

16:40.667 --> 16:42.900
<i>  but this is our first time,</i>

16:42.902 --> 16:44.669
and hope, her last time.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.270
<i>  So, everything's</i>
<i>  gotta be perfect,</i>

16:46.272 --> 16:47.405
<i>  you know, for her.</i>

16:49.642 --> 16:51.275
[all exclaiming]

16:51.277 --> 16:54.379
[all cheering]

16:54.381 --> 16:56.447
making the final damn walk.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.849
[all laughing]

16:57.851 --> 16:59.250
I'm happy that
friends and family

16:59.252 --> 17:01.119
and all the guests are coming.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.487
Maybe, the fifth
time's the charm.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.855
I don't know, who knows.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.223
[all laughing]

17:05.225 --> 17:06.357
<i> [mike] got all my grooms here,</i>

17:06.359 --> 17:07.792
everybody is here but jerry.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.293
We're just missing
one guy, man.

17:09.295 --> 17:11.896
One and only,
my partner, jerry benson.

17:11.898 --> 17:13.197
So, don't know
if he's gonna be

17:13.199 --> 17:14.632
able to be here or not today.

17:15.869 --> 17:17.935
We'll just remember him today.

17:17.937 --> 17:19.337
Hope that he gets better.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.048
I think we got 'em
all in one piece.

17:30.050 --> 17:32.183
[rogers] that's one thing you
can't do with harder rock.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.951
<i> [huck] one thing I like</i>
<i>  about stone furnace,</i>

17:33.953 --> 17:35.119
once you get it hot,

17:35.121 --> 17:36.954
it's gonna stay hot
for a long time

17:36.956 --> 17:39.057
<i>  and it takes a lot less wood.</i>

17:39.059 --> 17:41.459
You know, it's a little
more work, fixing one.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.928
But once you
get it fixed right,

17:43.930 --> 17:45.863
it pays off in the long run.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.665
Hand me the pot,
we'll go inside the layer

17:47.667 --> 17:48.666
and get it fixed.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.268
The main thing is
it sits right

17:50.270 --> 17:52.236
and then we're gonna
build around the pot.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.472
We got this black corn maize.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.040
<i>  It work and while</i>
<i>  we're working</i>

17:56.042 --> 17:57.408
<i>  on the build and the furnace</i>

17:57.410 --> 18:00.445
but it's not gonna be this,
like, old traditional whisky.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.179
Pretty solid.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.980
<i> [huck] amanda's gonna help us</i>

18:02.982 --> 18:05.850
<i>  infuse this liquor and turn</i>
<i>  it into something special.</i>

18:05.852 --> 18:08.386
We'll get furnace that's
build tight and everything,

18:08.388 --> 18:09.654
it will be good stuff.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.889
-How's this looking for--
-[rogers] looks good to me.

18:11.891 --> 18:12.957
Peace rock.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.859
[rogers] you wanna
lay the first rock?

18:14.861 --> 18:16.294
Oh, I'd love to.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.796
I've never built a wood
burning furnace before.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.998
About how far out
should we bring it?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.433
-I'd go in closer.
-[amanda] in closer.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.102
But I do work as
a roofer at home

18:24.104 --> 18:25.403
and I do stone masonry work.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.105
-About right there.
-[amanda] oh, okay.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.107
<i>  So, I feel right at home</i>
<i>  with these guys.</i>

18:29.109 --> 18:30.174
I love working hard,

18:30.176 --> 18:31.909
I don't mind getting
my hands dirty.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.011
Now, how close are we
gonna put these stones?

18:34.013 --> 18:35.413
In here, just bud 'em up.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.982
And then we'll fill in
the little gaps with the clay.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.118
Amanda's young,
she's eager to learn.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.085
[amanda] when do you wanna

18:41.087 --> 18:42.186
start putting
the clay in here?

18:42.188 --> 18:43.988
[rogers] well, if you wanna
make us a batch.

18:44.858 --> 18:46.023
She ain't lazy.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.391
I like somebody like that.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.426
Guys, I do have a question.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.094
At home, I'll usually just mix

18:50.096 --> 18:52.897
small portions of cement
'cause it sets.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.666
But this isn't gonna set
until we cook it, right?

18:55.668 --> 18:58.069
-That's right.
-So, I can mix
a good amount of it,

18:58.071 --> 18:59.137
so we have it to work with.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.239
That makes two buggies.

19:07.413 --> 19:10.047
-Can we rest you at minute?
-[amanda] sure, thank you.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.816
When I work with cement

19:11.818 --> 19:13.184
you know,
there's lye in cement,

19:13.186 --> 19:15.052
so you can't get it
on your skin

19:15.054 --> 19:16.654
'cause it literally
eats your skin.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.256
Is that the same
with this clay?

19:18.258 --> 19:19.290
It's not, right?

19:19.292 --> 19:21.058
All it does is
changes color.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.194
[both laugh]

19:23.196 --> 19:24.662
well, I'll be red-handed.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.364
I did bring some gloves

19:26.366 --> 19:27.999
to avoid that.

19:30.803 --> 19:31.936
[rogers grunts]

19:45.151 --> 19:47.385
[amanda] how thick are you
going in between layers now?

19:47.387 --> 19:49.453
-Just enough to seal it.
-[amanda] okay.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.856
This is something that
don't have to be perfect

19:51.858 --> 19:53.891
all it needs to
do is hold heat.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.227
[amanda] I'm kind of a
perfectionist, so I'll keep
that in mind.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.762
[huck] he'd mess up too.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.230
[rogers] no.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.464
[amanda] I like the clay,
it's a lot easier

20:00.466 --> 20:01.799
to work with then cement is.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.367
Amanda, she knows
what she's doing,

20:03.369 --> 20:05.203
you can tell she
has laid rock before.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.010
[all laughing]

20:14.814 --> 20:16.814
[amanda] so, about how far
up do you wanna build,

20:16.816 --> 20:18.282
like, right where
you got it here marked?

20:18.284 --> 20:20.084
-[rogers] yeah.
-[amanda] oh, it's sliding.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.819
[rogers] it is sliding.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.388
Let it settle.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.657
Worry about--
[sighs]

20:27.894 --> 20:28.893
damn, there's one rock

20:28.895 --> 20:30.294
we should have
put in right there.

20:33.299 --> 20:36.100
[amanda] no big deal.
No big deal.

20:37.971 --> 20:40.271
That's a masonry
saying, isn't it?

20:40.273 --> 20:42.740
[huck] look like you got
a damn mess, what happened?

20:42.742 --> 20:44.075
[rogers] son of
a bitch failed.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.278
Believe we're onto something
here handy boy.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.313
-[ramsey] how many
chairs are there?
-[digger] ten.

20:49.315 --> 20:50.881
[ramsey] we've got
enough barrels of liquor

20:50.883 --> 20:52.583
to put one in every chair.

20:52.585 --> 20:53.918
[digger exclaims]

20:53.920 --> 20:55.219
now, watch her go.

20:55.221 --> 20:57.688
[ramsey] we have to
harness the power of wind

20:57.690 --> 20:59.690
to keep our barrels in motion.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.993
We can roll them right
up here on this flat spot,

21:01.995 --> 21:03.794
-advance it forward.
-[digger] yup.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.496
[ramsey] hook 'em up,
move to the next one.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.198
The dream catcher
might be exactly

21:07.200 --> 21:08.966
what we're looking for.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.469
Look at that, if that
right there don't

21:11.471 --> 21:14.238
simulate the motion
of a boat on the ocean,

21:14.240 --> 21:15.873
I don't know what will.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.942
<i>  And this thing</i>
<i>  moves very easy.</i>

21:17.944 --> 21:19.877
And it moves in
every direction

21:19.879 --> 21:21.279
that a boat would.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.947
This is sea aging on dry land.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.348
This goes all over the place.

21:24.350 --> 21:27.385
I think we can make
something work with this.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.154
When you let go, it's gonna
keep going. I mean, watch it.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.690
It will go for a few
shakes on its own

21:32.692 --> 21:33.758
and then that blinker's gonna

21:33.760 --> 21:36.093
keep going in
sides for a while.

21:36.095 --> 21:39.030
<i>  You know, the motion</i>
<i>  with the temperature changes</i>

21:39.032 --> 21:40.264
and the biometric pressure,

21:40.266 --> 21:42.366
it causes that
liquor to turn over.

21:42.368 --> 21:44.268
And it gets more
exposure to wood,

21:44.270 --> 21:46.203
every bit of that liquor
would get exposed to the wood

21:46.205 --> 21:48.406
<i>  quicker than it would</i>
<i>  sitting in the rickhouse,</i>

21:48.408 --> 21:51.208
which magnifies
the aging process.

21:51.210 --> 21:54.178
Just build a sail
out of two-by-fours

21:54.180 --> 21:56.280
and put 'em up there
about four by four,

21:56.282 --> 21:57.214
something like that.

21:57.216 --> 21:58.783
[ramsey] a sail.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.885
-Capital idea, young man.
-[digger] yeah.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.987
If we can get some
sort of sail,

22:02.989 --> 22:04.288
put on these domes

22:04.290 --> 22:06.257
<i>  and it can catch</i>
<i>  just enough wind</i>

22:06.259 --> 22:07.258
to get it to rock,

22:07.260 --> 22:09.360
<i>  we'll get plenty</i>
<i>  enough movement</i>

22:09.362 --> 22:11.395
to get done what we
need to get done.

22:11.397 --> 22:13.664
<i> [ramsey] I think we have</i>
<i>  solved our problem</i>

22:13.666 --> 22:15.733
<i>  except for one thing.</i>

22:15.735 --> 22:18.736
We can't haul them barrels
all up here by ourselves.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.472
They're 500 pounds,
we gotta roll 'em up here

22:21.474 --> 22:23.407
<i>  and get 'em up</i>
<i>  on this flat spot.</i>

22:23.409 --> 22:25.176
<i>  It won't be easy to do.</i>

22:25.178 --> 22:27.211
-We'll have to have some help.
-Yup.

22:27.213 --> 22:29.647
-We need daniel.
-[digger] yeah.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.048
[ramsey] we gotta have help.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.818
<i>  I believe this is</i>
<i>  our location, hatty.</i>

22:33.820 --> 22:36.287
<i> [digger] let's go get started,</i>
<i>  reach out to daniel.</i>

22:46.866 --> 22:47.932
[huck] wait, that
will be good.

22:47.934 --> 22:50.401
[rogers] yeah, we got
a pretty looking rig here.

22:50.403 --> 22:52.370
We gonna light her up
and bake her out.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.338
[exclaims]

22:54.340 --> 22:55.473
[huck] what's up?

22:57.076 --> 22:58.075
[rogers] amanda,
you be careful

22:58.077 --> 22:59.577
if you ever do
this right here.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.812
What is that you put in there?
Is that, like, lighter fluid?

23:01.814 --> 23:03.781
-[rogers] it's gas.
-[amanda] gas.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.049
[rogers] if you do it
right, it's safe.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.951
But if you just throw
a bunch of gas

23:06.953 --> 23:09.387
in all them fumes is
dangerous, it's gonna blow up.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.522
But this is a good
safety right here

23:11.524 --> 23:13.924
to blot and weigh up wood.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.659
No matter how wide
it is, it will light.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.199
Don't spill it,
whatever you do.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.135
-[amanda] it's like, a candle.
-[rogers] yeah.

23:24.137 --> 23:25.669
So, only the top of it burns.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.238
Yes, it's like, a candle.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.739
[amanda] oh, my gosh.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.242
[rogers] rock furnace,
good steady heat.

23:31.244 --> 23:33.778
It keeps your steam
running just about right.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.414
Take a good hour or better
to get hot, you know.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.215
That's what it take to
make some real good

23:38.217 --> 23:39.917
smooth, high proof flavor.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.452
When mark told me we're
gonna build a furnace,

23:41.454 --> 23:42.953
<i>  I was thinking,</i>
<i>  he would teach me</i>

23:42.955 --> 23:44.388
<i>  how just to build a furnace.</i>

23:44.390 --> 23:46.257
<i> You know, I kinda already know</i>
<i>  how to work with stones</i>

23:46.259 --> 23:48.726
but in building the furnace,
I feel like I learned

23:48.728 --> 23:50.828
a whole lot more than
I ever anticipated

23:50.830 --> 23:53.364
and can't wait to take it home
and put it all to practice.

23:53.366 --> 23:55.366
You learned me
a whole lot so far.

23:55.368 --> 23:58.402
Well, I'd say you can learn
me and huck a lot

23:58.404 --> 24:00.371
-from what we're told.
-I hope so.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.407
I can pay you back
a little bit for all this

24:03.409 --> 24:05.142
good knowledge
you shared with me.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.519
<i> [photographer] guys,</i>
<i>  let's strike a pose.</i>

24:15.521 --> 24:17.388
Let's all look at
different directions.

24:17.390 --> 24:18.756
Y'all are good at this.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.357
This weeding's been
a long time coming.

24:20.359 --> 24:22.293
I've got all my friends
and family are here.

24:22.295 --> 24:24.328
I'm beginning to lose
hope right now

24:24.330 --> 24:26.030
that jerry's gonna make it
through the wedding.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.665
We basically, got
about ten minutes

24:27.667 --> 24:30.067
and pitching to walk
down that aisle.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.403
I think he's gonna show up
at the last minute.

24:33.239 --> 24:34.505
[woman] if he can, he will.

24:35.308 --> 24:36.474
He's the tire man.

24:36.476 --> 24:37.875
Yeah, I hope so.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.276
I don't know.

24:40.346 --> 24:42.546
I hope he can get
to make it out today.

24:44.550 --> 24:46.217
[man] there's jerry
right there.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.419
It is jerry!

24:52.291 --> 24:54.258
[mike] what's up, brother?

24:54.260 --> 24:55.326
Didn't think you'd
make it, bro.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.294
-[jerry] are you good?
-I'm good.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.066
It's been a few days.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.001
Glad you're here.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.336
I'm glad I'm able to be here.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.972
Yes, sir, me too.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.640
Yup, the party's complete
now, brother.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.208
No doubt.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.911
I'm lost for damn words,
I get emotional,

25:13.913 --> 25:16.146
you know, when I talk
about jerry and his health

25:16.148 --> 25:18.215
and how fast something
could happen.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.550
-Love you.
-Love you, brother.

25:19.552 --> 25:20.784
Oh, lord!

25:20.786 --> 25:22.052
[exclaims]

25:22.054 --> 25:25.055
I'm grateful and I'm
thankful that he's here

25:25.057 --> 25:27.958
and he's in good enough shape
to be here to stand by me,

25:27.960 --> 25:29.860
means everything
in the world to me.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.495
-[jerry] you nervous?
-[mike] yeah.

25:31.497 --> 25:33.297
I'm really nervous, you know.

25:33.933 --> 25:35.366
But I feel a lot better now.

25:35.368 --> 25:36.867
[jerry chuckles]

25:36.869 --> 25:39.637
you know, I've been
nervous for a month now

25:39.639 --> 25:41.338
waiting on this wedding day.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.673
<i>  But now that we're all here,</i>

25:42.675 --> 25:44.241
<i>  I'm pretty much</i>
<i>  getting calmed down.</i>

25:44.243 --> 25:45.442
<i>  You know, I'm</i>
<i>  a little bit nervous,</i>

25:45.444 --> 25:47.344
<i>  I'm fixing to marry</i>
<i>  the love of my life</i>

25:47.346 --> 25:48.412
<i>  and I'm getting kinda antsy,</i>

25:48.414 --> 25:50.347
I can't wait to see her
in that pretty dress.

25:51.784 --> 25:54.018
<i>  I went through a whole</i>
<i>  lot with women folk</i>

25:54.020 --> 25:56.820
but I know for a fact I've got
the right one this time.

25:56.822 --> 26:00.257
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

26:00.259 --> 26:01.992
You may kiss your bride.

26:01.994 --> 26:04.828
[all cheering]

26:04.830 --> 26:06.830
<i> [mike] you know, now we're</i>
<i>  officially a married couple</i>

26:06.832 --> 26:07.998
<i>  after seven years.</i>

26:08.000 --> 26:08.966
[announcer] ladies
and gentlemen,

26:08.968 --> 26:09.967
big round of applause

26:09.969 --> 26:14.471
for mr. And
mrs. Mike cockrell.

26:14.473 --> 26:16.373
<i> [mike] married my wife</i>
<i>  that's so beautiful</i>

26:16.375 --> 26:18.475
<i>  and having everybody here,</i>

26:18.477 --> 26:20.277
this is the best
day of my life.

26:20.279 --> 26:21.345
The first thing I wanna do,

26:21.347 --> 26:23.314
I wanna thank each
and everybody

26:23.316 --> 26:26.016
for showing up to
this very special day.

26:26.018 --> 26:29.420
This is our special
blueberry champagne.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.655
We're gonna give a toast
for me and jenna.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.691
We've been together
over seven years

26:33.693 --> 26:34.925
and with these rings,

26:34.927 --> 26:37.061
it's forever, ever more.

26:37.063 --> 26:39.229
-That being said,
I love you, baby.
-I love you.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.432
And I'm ready to spend the
rest of our lives together.

26:41.434 --> 26:44.168
[all applauding]

26:47.907 --> 26:50.574
[all cheering]

26:54.146 --> 26:56.046
<i> [mike] champagne actually</i>
<i>  is very, very pretty,</i>

26:56.048 --> 26:57.147
it's very purple

26:57.149 --> 26:59.249
<i>  but kinda transparent</i>
<i>  at the same time</i>

26:59.251 --> 27:01.251
and got plenty
of bubbles in it.

27:01.253 --> 27:03.087
<i>  Everybody's taking a toast,</i>

27:03.089 --> 27:05.022
taking the drink,
I don't see any frowns,

27:05.024 --> 27:06.123
nobody's spitting
at the floor,

27:06.125 --> 27:07.858
<i>  so hope everybody</i>
<i>  else like it.</i>

27:07.860 --> 27:10.294
<i>  You know, the other half</i>
<i>  of this champagne,</i>

27:10.296 --> 27:12.329
I still gotta sell it and try
and make some money.

27:12.331 --> 27:13.530
Cheers, everybody!

27:13.532 --> 27:15.265
[all cheering]

27:22.274 --> 27:24.942
<i> [mike] I am as happy</i>
<i>  as any man can be</i>

27:24.944 --> 27:26.877
about how everything
went down today.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.212
<i>  Married my wife</i>

27:28.214 --> 27:31.115
<i>  and jerry was able</i>
<i>  to be there by my side.</i>

27:31.117 --> 27:32.549
<i>  It was a perfect day.</i>

27:34.086 --> 27:35.419
-[kisses]
-love you, baby.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.688
[laughs]

27:37.690 --> 27:40.157
<i> [ramsey] we're betting it all,</i>
<i> we're letting the big end drag</i>

27:40.159 --> 27:41.392
<i>  on this adventure here.</i>

27:41.394 --> 27:42.926
<i>  If it don't work,</i>

27:42.928 --> 27:45.162
<i>  we wasted a lot of time.</i>

27:49.135 --> 27:51.769
[amanda] can't wait to see the
furnace, all dried up for us.

27:51.771 --> 27:54.705
<i>  Mark and huck are the first</i>
<i>  old-school moonshiners</i>

27:54.707 --> 27:56.340
that I'm gonna get
to make a run with.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.442
[rogers] let's clean this up,
a bucket or two

27:58.444 --> 28:00.210
and see if we can
get this run started.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.311
<i> [amanda] they use</i>
<i>  furnace heat,</i>

28:01.313 --> 28:03.647
so it's not direct
heat on the pot.

28:03.649 --> 28:05.983
And that can give
a whole different flavor.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.685
<i>  So, I'm really eager to</i>
<i>  learn how they do that</i>

28:07.687 --> 28:09.153
and just to see

28:09.155 --> 28:10.888
what the difference
in the taste is.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.356
[huck] I'll tell you what
to do, amanda.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.991
Take it off, firstly
see what it looks like.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.325
I can do the honors.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.762
Think it's a good sign
if the bees like it.

28:18.764 --> 28:20.264
[huck] they're
the first customers.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.099
The way we're
doing it this year.

28:22.101 --> 28:23.801
[amanda] I'm gonna
give him right to you.

28:23.803 --> 28:26.470
<i> [rogers] we're making up</i>
<i>  some real quality liquor,</i>
<i>  you know.</i>

28:26.472 --> 28:29.273
Some different stuff all these
other moonshiners got out

28:29.275 --> 28:32.242
<i>  but today, we're gonna</i>
<i>  get back to the basics.</i>

28:32.244 --> 28:33.410
<i>  We're gonna show</i>
<i>  her how to do it</i>

28:33.412 --> 28:35.746
the way we've always
done in all our life.

28:35.748 --> 28:37.214
It's getting down on
to the corner now.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.615
[rogers] now it's done,
I'll fire it up.

28:38.617 --> 28:40.217
Yeah, we're just about there.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.286
After one more
bucket, it will do it.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.387
This is the part that I've
been waiting for

28:43.389 --> 28:44.321
this whole time,

28:44.356 --> 28:46.690
<i>  to run the smash</i>
<i>  with mark and huck.</i>

28:46.692 --> 28:49.560
Tell you what I'll do,
I'll get the fire started,

28:49.562 --> 28:52.196
I'll let you and amanda
cap your mouth for muck.

28:52.198 --> 28:53.230
We'll do it.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.165
My nerves are pretty
much gone at this point.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.301
And I'm just really excited to

28:57.303 --> 28:59.236
<i>  see how this furnace works.</i>

28:59.238 --> 29:00.304
The wood's gonna be
any different today

29:00.306 --> 29:01.839
-than what we--
-[rogers] yeah.

29:01.841 --> 29:04.174
Get it started good but
I'm gonna add locust to it.

29:04.176 --> 29:05.876
-[amanda] okay.
-Make her hot as we can.

29:05.878 --> 29:08.278
So, the special
locust wood. Cool.

29:08.280 --> 29:11.348
<i>  Locust is more dense,</i>
<i>  it don't smoke much.</i>

29:12.051 --> 29:13.917
<i>  It burns longer, gets hotter,</i>

29:13.919 --> 29:17.020
that's the hottest wood
we got in these mountains.

29:17.022 --> 29:19.590
[huck] amanda, let me
show a little trick here.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.826
Anytime, if you work
around these joints

29:22.828 --> 29:24.995
like, this right
here and here.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.497
If it gets leaking on you,

29:26.499 --> 29:28.165
keep some old rags on it.

29:29.135 --> 29:30.868
Just wet it real good.

29:30.870 --> 29:35.939
And just kinda... Just wrap it
around that, like up there.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.975
I get real frustrated when
that stuff leaks sometimes.

29:37.977 --> 29:40.043
-This will stop it.
-Oh, shoot.

29:40.045 --> 29:41.311
I need a little book, so I can
write all this stuff down.

29:41.313 --> 29:42.613
Yeah.

29:42.615 --> 29:45.382
[rogers] amanda, let me show
you something right here.

29:45.384 --> 29:48.619
It's so big, it's gonna take
a long time for it to heat up.

29:48.621 --> 29:50.754
Let's just pull him
straight to the furnace.

29:50.756 --> 29:53.390
What we're trying to get
to is the bed of coals,
right here.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.459
One it starts running,
watch it stream.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.860
If the stream gets too big

29:56.862 --> 29:58.962
-just pull your coals back.
-Yeah.

29:58.964 --> 30:01.932
[rogers] if it slows down,
just push more coal.

30:01.934 --> 30:04.668
-Then you can work it then.
-[amanda] got you.

30:04.670 --> 30:06.670
[rogers] I'm gonna let
you run this run.

30:06.672 --> 30:08.639
That's the best way to learn

30:08.641 --> 30:09.973
is do it yourself.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.075
-Baptism by fire, correct?
-Yup.

30:12.077 --> 30:14.211
<i>  Yeah, it's just like,</i>
<i>  teaching the little youngins.</i>

30:14.213 --> 30:17.147
Tell 'em what she wants
and let 'em go at it

30:17.149 --> 30:19.049
and they'll learn
that quicker than

30:19.051 --> 30:21.251
any way that you can do it.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.187
[huck] amanda, here's what
you've been waiting on.

30:23.189 --> 30:24.388
-Here you go.
-[amanda] oh!

30:24.390 --> 30:25.956
[huck] let it run for a little
long then you throw 'em

30:25.958 --> 30:27.457
heads off, start
catching you liquor.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.393
So, the way we're doing things
here is a little bit different

30:29.395 --> 30:30.994
than how I do it at home.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.296
<i>  I keep track of temperature</i>

30:32.298 --> 30:34.097
to see exactly where
we're at in the run.

30:34.099 --> 30:35.766
[rogers] if your
stream starts dying,

30:35.768 --> 30:36.867
you gotta put some wood in.

30:36.869 --> 30:39.336
But small stick, don't
never use nothing big.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.038
No, I just have a little
nozzle I can turn up

30:41.040 --> 30:42.940
to check the propane
and adjust my heat.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.843
I'm so careful that I try to
make sure I make my exact cuts

30:45.845 --> 30:47.744
but you guys just know
by eye and by taste

30:47.746 --> 30:49.079
exactly how to do it.

30:49.081 --> 30:51.915
-I think, I overthink things
maybe, yo think?
-[rogers] yeah.

30:51.917 --> 30:54.017
-[huck] good looking liquor.
-[amanda] smells really good.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.220
[huck] clear as a bell.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.156
What do you think?

30:59.158 --> 31:01.491
Really good. It's hot
but really smooth.

31:01.493 --> 31:02.392
I think it tastes better

31:02.394 --> 31:04.394
with that wood burning
heat, I really do.

31:06.232 --> 31:09.199
<i>  I think, maybe, 'cause that</i>
<i> heat is so evenly distributed,</i>

31:09.201 --> 31:11.068
it's not directly on
the bottom of the pot.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.036
The whole pot and all
the mash got heated

31:13.038 --> 31:14.438
evenly at the same time.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.875
And I think, maybe that helps
the liquor run a lot smoother.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.076
-Good way to do it.
-Yeah.

31:19.078 --> 31:21.445
Yeah, it's like,
all clicking for me now.

31:21.447 --> 31:23.647
Mark and huck, they
don't need a textbook,

31:23.649 --> 31:24.982
they don't need a thermometer,

31:24.984 --> 31:27.284
<i>  they don't need any special</i>
<i>  rule of how to do things.</i>

31:27.286 --> 31:28.819
<i>  They just know how it's done.</i>

31:28.821 --> 31:30.420
It's really cool to see,

31:30.422 --> 31:33.090
you guys are still practicing
this the way
the old timers did it.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.892
I have so much
respect for that.

31:34.894 --> 31:38.161
That's really the only
way that I know.

31:38.163 --> 31:39.529
See, if you can cap
this bucket off,

31:39.531 --> 31:40.297
we'll begin to check.

31:40.299 --> 31:41.265
[amanda] all right.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.133
<i>  I'm really looking forward</i>
<i>  to helping them</i>

31:43.135 --> 31:46.203
make a really smooth,
delicious infused moonshine.

31:46.205 --> 31:48.605
<i>  And maybe, I can teach them a</i>
<i>  little bit something as well.</i>

31:49.308 --> 31:50.274
Woo!

32:00.119 --> 32:02.853
[man] hell, yeah.
What do you think, daniel?

32:02.855 --> 32:04.421
Well, you didn't know
he's getting here

32:04.423 --> 32:06.189
-to a carnival.
-We're up in the clouds.

32:06.191 --> 32:07.691
<i> [ramsey] we are,</i>
<i>  that's why they called it</i>

32:07.693 --> 32:09.059
<i>  ghost town in the sky.</i>

32:09.061 --> 32:10.060
[digger chuckles]

32:10.062 --> 32:11.862
we're trying to do
a experiment here

32:11.864 --> 32:13.297
<i>  to make us something</i>
<i>  where we can</i>

32:13.299 --> 32:16.099
<i>  sea age our tennessee</i>
<i>  whisky on dry land.</i>

32:16.101 --> 32:18.101
This thing is recreates
every movement

32:18.103 --> 32:20.404
that a boat would
on the water.

32:20.406 --> 32:23.674
We really feel that this old
dream catcher machine,

32:23.676 --> 32:24.808
<i>  here at ghost town,</i>

32:24.810 --> 32:27.444
will serve our purpose
tremendously well.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.379
I think that you're on
to something here.

32:29.381 --> 32:30.681
I really think it will work.

32:30.683 --> 32:32.416
The chore that
we're gonna have

32:32.418 --> 32:34.785
<i>  is getting the barrels in</i>
<i>  these damn buckets here</i>

32:34.787 --> 32:35.953
<i>  is gonna be the deal.</i>

32:35.955 --> 32:38.055
So, now you know moreover
why we brought you here.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.657
-We need your horsepower
more than your brainpower.
-Yeah, I got you.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.059
You know, daniel
is several years

32:42.061 --> 32:43.160
younger than me and digger.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.996
You can look at him,
he's stout as a bear.

32:45.998 --> 32:47.030
[digger] once you
get it going,

32:47.032 --> 32:48.532
it will come out on its own.

32:48.534 --> 32:49.766
<i> [ramsey] these</i>
<i>  barrels are full,</i>

32:49.768 --> 32:51.568
they're heavy,
600 pounds each.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.370
Watch your fingers,
watch your fingers, boys.

32:53.772 --> 32:54.705
[grunts]

32:54.707 --> 32:57.474
you know, you can't
have too much help.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.143
[digger] I hope we got enough
juice to get it up there now.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.244
That's a heavy bastard,

33:01.246 --> 33:03.246
did you hear the truck
squeak right down there?

33:03.248 --> 33:05.415
[ramsey] you can kick it,
how you go, hatty.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.851
How about them apples,
huh, mister?

33:07.853 --> 33:09.653
I just don't wanna
drop it too fast.

33:09.655 --> 33:11.822
[grunts]
I hope this old deck's solid.

33:11.824 --> 33:14.124
If we can get it on
wood, it will help us.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.359
[daniel] there, we got one.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.227
-Damn!
-[digger] just take your time.

33:17.930 --> 33:18.996
[sighs]

33:18.998 --> 33:21.098
[ramsey] all right,
it's good enough.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.068
[digger] we've got ten
barrels with us.

33:25.070 --> 33:27.738
That's what tennessee whisky,
we've got cup.

33:27.740 --> 33:29.906
Son of a bitch, this is too
much like work, boys.

33:29.908 --> 33:32.009
And if we can get them
in some of these seats

33:32.011 --> 33:34.144
<i>  and get 'em moving,</i>
<i> we're going to be in business.</i>

33:34.146 --> 33:36.346
-[daniel] we got it.
-Put it right there now.

33:39.018 --> 33:40.283
Hard on fat boys, ain't it.

33:40.285 --> 33:41.952
[ramsey laughs]
yup.

33:41.954 --> 33:44.354
We got to get that damn
cherry picker up here.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.156
Damn you.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.059
[all exclaiming]

33:49.328 --> 33:50.360
[ramsey] here you go.

33:50.396 --> 33:51.928
[digger] 30-40 more minutes
of that and I'd have

33:51.930 --> 33:53.930
this thing jacked up high
enough to get her on there.

33:53.932 --> 33:55.665
[ramsey] oh, it's,
just a little tedious

33:55.667 --> 33:56.833
but sure will help.

33:56.835 --> 33:58.935
Put it right there.
Hold it right there.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.337
[daniel] look at it.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.139
<i> [ramsey] you know,</i>
<i>  we gotta secure 'em.</i>

34:02.141 --> 34:03.306
We don't wanna
come back up here

34:03.308 --> 34:04.708
and them fell
through the deck,

34:04.710 --> 34:06.443
<i>  laying on the ground,</i>
<i>  busted open.</i>

34:06.445 --> 34:08.445
And all our liquor running
down buck mountain.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.881
[digger] oh, we're good.

34:10.883 --> 34:12.816
[ramsey] that right there is
the motion of the ocean, boys.

34:12.818 --> 34:14.184
It is.

34:14.186 --> 34:16.586
If it just moves around like
this here during some wind,

34:17.189 --> 34:17.921
that's plenty.

34:17.923 --> 34:19.156
It sure is.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.390
You know, when you
look at these things,

34:20.392 --> 34:22.826
it kinda looks like, a baby
sitting in a cradle.

34:22.828 --> 34:25.195
<i>  It's kinda what it is.</i>
<i>  It's in infant stages,</i>

34:25.197 --> 34:27.030
now we gotta
bring it to maturity.

34:28.333 --> 34:29.299
A-ha.

34:29.301 --> 34:31.034
I guess that's the end of it,
boys.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.369
<i> Do we bring some more up here?</i>

34:32.371 --> 34:35.005
<i> [ramsey] now, we're</i>
<i>  gonna start building sails.</i>

34:37.242 --> 34:39.476
<i> [digger] well, mark has</i>
<i>  come up with a design,</i>

34:39.478 --> 34:41.478
we're gonna build
kind of a square

34:41.480 --> 34:43.547
<i>  and tack a tarp to it.</i>

34:46.085 --> 34:47.784
<i>  Then, we're gonna screw that</i>

34:47.786 --> 34:49.219
to the ride itself.

34:50.823 --> 34:52.989
[daniel] hell, yes, I got
my raise, boys.

34:52.991 --> 34:54.424
[ramsey] hell,
if this is that,

34:54.426 --> 34:56.393
-we'll make
a move to the next.
-[daniel] move on.

35:03.936 --> 35:05.102
Well, it's gotten cooler.

35:05.104 --> 35:07.237
We can hear thunder
in the distance.

35:07.239 --> 35:09.739
<i>  We might just very well</i>
<i>  see a little bit of wind</i>

35:09.741 --> 35:10.941
<i>  come here in a little bit.</i>

35:10.943 --> 35:12.242
<i> [ramsey] you know,</i>
<i>  we spent a lot of time</i>

35:12.244 --> 35:13.910
<i>  trying to build</i>
<i>  this contraption.</i>

35:13.912 --> 35:16.079
We're betting it all,
we're letting the big end drag

35:16.081 --> 35:17.414
on this adventure here.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.916
It doesn't take a rocket
scientist to figure out

35:19.918 --> 35:21.685
<i>  that we're kinda</i>
<i>  deeply invested</i>

35:21.687 --> 35:23.286
<i>  in this tennessee whisky,</i>

35:23.288 --> 35:26.756
<i>  so we got no choice but</i>
<i>  to get these barrels to move.</i>

35:26.758 --> 35:29.292
-I know one thing, boys.
-[daniel] what's that?

35:29.294 --> 35:31.995
As hard as we worked
on this brilliant thing,

35:31.997 --> 35:33.396
if it don't work,

35:33.398 --> 35:35.465
we've wasted a lot of time.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.567
-Yeah.
-[ramsey] and several dollars.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.804
<i>  The damn storm's a-coming.</i>

35:40.806 --> 35:42.672
<i> [digger] if they don't</i>
<i>  move, we're done.</i>

35:48.981 --> 35:50.213
<i> [digger] get in there, boy.</i>

35:50.215 --> 35:51.882
You're under arrest.

35:51.884 --> 35:54.050
<i> [ramsey] oh, I don't</i>
<i>  put no liquor in here.</i>

35:54.052 --> 35:55.018
<i>  Damn, jail house.</i>

35:55.020 --> 35:56.620
[digger] damn, brother,
what you do?

35:57.322 --> 35:58.989
They cut your hand off.

35:59.324 --> 36:00.924
This ain't no count.

36:00.926 --> 36:03.660
Well, I'll be here to see
you in the morning.

36:03.662 --> 36:06.029
I'll be right over here on
this flea ridden bed,

36:06.031 --> 36:08.298
taking me a nap,
waiting on you.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.267
Don't you dare try to escape.

36:10.269 --> 36:12.102
[ramsey chuckles]
so, that was a bust.

36:12.104 --> 36:13.470
[digger] as usual.

36:16.909 --> 36:18.808
<i> [ramsey] the damn</i>
<i>  storm's a-coming.</i>

36:18.810 --> 36:20.911
<i> [digger] if they don't</i>
<i>  move, we're done.</i>

36:20.913 --> 36:22.479
<i> [digger] whether this</i>
<i>  is gonna work or not,</i>

36:22.481 --> 36:23.980
it remains to be seen

36:23.982 --> 36:26.917
but at this point, it's all we
got, it's our only option.

36:29.655 --> 36:32.055
Here we go, here
it comes, guys.

36:32.057 --> 36:33.757
<i> [digger] there you go,</i>
<i>  there's your guest coming.</i>

36:33.759 --> 36:35.225
We're catching wind, guys.

36:35.227 --> 36:37.527
[digger] yeah, if we just get
a little bit more wind.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.429
<i> [ramsey] little bit more,</i>
<i>  it's a-coming.</i>

36:43.368 --> 36:44.734
[digger] oh, yeah.

36:44.736 --> 36:47.404
Hell yeah. Look how
it's blowing here.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.372
[ramsey] that's the plan,
that's all we gotta do.

36:49.374 --> 36:51.274
[digger] oh, it's gotta
move, right there.

36:51.276 --> 36:53.810
This ain't out of control
wind and it's a-moving.

36:53.812 --> 36:56.313
Yes, this is just a good,
steady breeze.

36:56.315 --> 36:58.915
[ramsey] if it'll do this two
or three days a week,

36:58.917 --> 37:00.383
we're golden, boys.

37:00.385 --> 37:02.385
You know, as long as
these old chariots here

37:02.387 --> 37:04.020
are moving a little bit,

37:04.022 --> 37:05.889
<i>  then the whisky</i>
<i>  inside the barrel</i>

37:05.891 --> 37:07.958
<i>  don't have any</i>
<i>  choice but to move.</i>

37:07.960 --> 37:09.459
Just like a baby in a cradle.

37:09.461 --> 37:12.062
It's as safe as it was
in its mommy's arms.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.730
Thing about it is,
when these stop,

37:13.732 --> 37:14.965
that liquor ain't stopped,

37:14.967 --> 37:17.400
it's still in there moving,
it's sloshing around.

37:17.402 --> 37:20.036
We got the biometric
pressure changes here,

37:20.038 --> 37:21.538
we got the temperature changes

37:21.540 --> 37:23.340
<i>  and now we've got the wind.</i>

37:23.342 --> 37:24.407
All this is perfect.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.009
We couldn't have
got it no better.

37:26.011 --> 37:28.078
God, we've done
it sure as hell.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.879
<i> All the hard work is paid off,</i>

37:29.881 --> 37:31.248
it is gonna work.

37:31.250 --> 37:33.917
<i>  I'll tell you one thing,</i>
<i>  I was concerned.</i>

37:33.919 --> 37:35.785
You know, we've
worked terribly hard

37:35.787 --> 37:37.020
to get this done.

37:37.022 --> 37:39.422
I was pretty much ready
to throw in the towel on it.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.758
[digger] I'd hate to have done
all of that damn work

37:41.760 --> 37:43.260
-for nothing, wouldn't you?
-[ramsey] yeah.

37:43.262 --> 37:45.028
<i>  I think all of our hard</i>
<i>  work has paid off,</i>

37:45.030 --> 37:46.196
it's gonna work fine.

37:46.198 --> 37:47.931
That's why they say, if you
don't like the weather

37:47.933 --> 37:49.299
in the mountains,
wait a few minutes.

37:49.301 --> 37:50.734
[digger] wait a few
minutes, it will change.

37:50.736 --> 37:51.768
I'm liking it.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.904
I'd like it even more when
about six months pass.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.374
<i>  This is gonna revolutionize</i>
<i>  our liquor selling world,</i>

37:57.376 --> 37:58.975
we're gonna get
five-year old liquor

37:58.977 --> 38:00.410
in five to six months.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.345
Longer it stays in there,
better it's gonna get.

38:02.347 --> 38:03.346
Exactly.

38:03.348 --> 38:05.815
I say, we just come
and get it as we need it.

38:05.817 --> 38:06.883
[digger] oh, yeah.
There ain't no sense

38:06.885 --> 38:08.051
in taking 'em all out at once.

38:08.053 --> 38:11.288
Whenever we get one, we
just replace it with another.

38:11.290 --> 38:14.124
Yeah. Daniel, you know what
this means, don't you?

38:14.126 --> 38:16.059
You and kelly's gotta
double time it now,

38:16.061 --> 38:18.094
we gotta step up our
tennessee whisky.

38:18.096 --> 38:19.362
We gotta have them
tennessee whisky.

38:19.364 --> 38:20.997
<i>  This old dream catcher here</i>

38:20.999 --> 38:22.966
seems to be what
dreams are made of.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.868
Boys, we ain't doing
it no justice here.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.504
A watched pot don't boil
and watched liquor don't age.

38:27.506 --> 38:31.074
<i>  I think, dream catcher whisky</i>
<i>  has a right, catchy sound.</i>

38:31.076 --> 38:32.809
This calls for celebration.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.244
You know, I'd probably try it.

38:34.246 --> 38:37.113
<i>  Sea aging in the mountains.</i>

38:45.257 --> 38:47.891
<i> [mike] the champagne went over</i>
<i>  really well at the wedding.</i>

38:47.893 --> 38:50.093
<i>  I'm gonna see</i>
<i>  this guy, biscuit.</i>

38:50.095 --> 38:52.996
A friend of mine, o'brien,
put me onto him.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.230
It's his cousin.

38:54.232 --> 38:55.965
I'm gonna go up there
and see if he wants to buy

38:55.967 --> 38:57.667
the rest of this stuff.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.069
He sounded really interested,

38:59.071 --> 39:01.504
I'm bringing the rest
of the 24 bottles.

39:01.506 --> 39:03.273
<i>  I'm gonna try to drag</i>
<i>  a pretty damn good,</i>

39:03.275 --> 39:04.441
<i>  hard bargain tonight.</i>

39:04.443 --> 39:06.042
<i>  I'm gonna try to get</i>
<i>  a 100 bucks</i>

39:06.044 --> 39:07.744
<i>  a damn bottle for this stuff.</i>

39:07.746 --> 39:09.279
And try to get some
money in my pocket

39:09.281 --> 39:11.081
to give back to jerry
to help him with his,

39:11.083 --> 39:13.216
you know, hospital bills.

39:13.218 --> 39:15.251
<i>  It's been a few days</i>
<i>  since my wedding now</i>

39:15.253 --> 39:17.354
<i>  and... All I can think about</i>

39:17.356 --> 39:19.022
is trying to help jerry out

39:19.024 --> 39:21.891
with his financial state and
his doctor bills and stuff.

39:21.893 --> 39:24.260
I'm gonna see if I can't
sell some champagne.

39:25.497 --> 39:27.230
<i>  I just wanna get</i>
<i>  this stuff sold</i>

39:27.232 --> 39:29.032
<i>  for a damn good premium price</i>

39:29.034 --> 39:31.835
and get some money
back in jerry's pocket.

39:31.837 --> 39:33.670
-[biscuit] hey, there!
-What's going on?

39:33.672 --> 39:36.139
-[biscuit] mike, right?
-Yup, you must be biscuit.

39:36.141 --> 39:37.874
That's right, that's me,
how are you doing?

39:37.876 --> 39:39.409
[mike] all right, nice
to meet you, brother.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.378
Well, I heard from o'brien

39:41.380 --> 39:44.280
that you might want some
of this champagne here.

39:44.282 --> 39:45.949
Well, o'brien said
it was really good.

39:45.951 --> 39:48.151
He was just raving about it.

39:48.153 --> 39:49.819
It had really good
flavor and everything.

39:49.821 --> 39:52.122
[mike] it does, it's got
a damn good flavor.

39:53.959 --> 39:55.191
You wanna take a sip of it?

39:55.193 --> 39:57.127
[biscuit] yeah, let me see
what it tastes like.

39:57.562 --> 39:58.561
He said it was really--

40:00.065 --> 40:01.064
[mike] whoa!

40:02.134 --> 40:03.533
Well, that's gonna take off,
ain't it?

40:04.302 --> 40:05.235
[mike] yeah, buddy!

40:05.237 --> 40:07.203
-Ooh, buddy.
-[mike] it's champagne.

40:07.205 --> 40:09.172
That's good champagne,
right there.

40:09.674 --> 40:11.941
Well, it smells good.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.043
Some of the backwoods finest
blueberry champagne.

40:14.045 --> 40:15.311
[biscuit] you can
smell blueberry in it.

40:15.313 --> 40:17.380
[mike] take you a little sip
and see what you think.

40:21.386 --> 40:23.787
O'brien was right, that's got
the flavors coming right out
in it.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.255
-[mike] you like it?
-That is really good.

40:25.257 --> 40:28.458
He loves it. I can see it
in his eyes, he's wanting it.

40:28.460 --> 40:29.926
I'll tell you what,

40:29.928 --> 40:31.494
it's gonna cost you
$100 a bottle.

40:31.496 --> 40:33.096
Oh, man!

40:33.098 --> 40:34.330
Coming at me hard, ain't you?

40:34.332 --> 40:35.865
[mike] well, what
are you thinking?

40:35.867 --> 40:38.268
-I was think $50 a bottle.
-[mike] oh! [bleep]

40:38.270 --> 40:39.436
you're crazier than hell.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.037
I gotta make money on it.

40:41.706 --> 40:44.073
I don't do this stuff
for my health.

40:44.075 --> 40:46.676
I'll tell you what I do,
I go $90 a bottle on it

40:46.678 --> 40:49.979
and, you know, that's gonna
be about it, man, for me.

40:50.215 --> 40:52.649
I can't go that high.

40:53.485 --> 40:55.385
I'll take all 24
of 'em, right now,

40:55.387 --> 40:57.654
if you give me $75 a bottle.

40:57.656 --> 40:59.189
That's as high as I can go.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.359
$75, I see.

41:05.197 --> 41:07.197
-That sounds like a deal.
-That will work.

41:07.199 --> 41:10.066
You know, that's $1,800
going straight to jerry.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.734
I sold each and every bottle.

41:11.736 --> 41:13.303
This is a heavy load.

41:13.305 --> 41:15.338
-[biscuit] just set
it right there.
-[mike] yes, sir.

41:15.340 --> 41:16.973
You know, all that
matters to me

41:16.975 --> 41:18.708
is getting jerry
back to full health

41:18.710 --> 41:21.044
and giving him the money
to pay his bills

41:21.046 --> 41:22.979
<i>  and getting him back</i>
<i>  in the field with me.</i>

41:22.981 --> 41:24.314
[biscuit] I appreciate
you, brother.

41:24.316 --> 41:26.216
[mike] all right, man.
You have a good one.

41:26.218 --> 41:27.317
[biscuit] all right,
man. You too.
