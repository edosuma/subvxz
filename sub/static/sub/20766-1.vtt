02:38.909 --> 02:40.286
He is looking better already.

02:41.203 --> 02:42.295
Maybe.

02:43.747 --> 02:44.919
Still hasn't said a word.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.545
It's gonna take time.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.675
They've got the best doctors
in the world here.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.843
It's gonna happen.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.398
- Nervous?
- No.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.069
Maybe... a little bit.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.062
No.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.823
Are you turning soft on me?

03:09.898 --> 03:11.275
No, I can't. I'm on call.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.819
I thought this was
a celebration.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.745
It is, kinda.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.466
<i>...the world
awaiting anxiously</i>

03:18.490 --> 03:20.743
<i>for Alterplex to launch
what the company claims to be</i>

03:20.826 --> 03:22.874
<i>the final generation
of energy solutions.</i>

03:23.578 --> 03:26.422
<i>If you're joining us now,
we are less than a minute away</i>

03:26.498 --> 03:28.000
<i>from entering a new future.</i>

03:34.214 --> 03:35.557
This is really big for me.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.810
I want it to be good
for you guys, too.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.478
- You know?
- I know.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.015
And I'm proud of you.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.486
I think.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.039
<i>Alterplex
gives the green light.</i>

03:58.530 --> 03:59.577
Hey, Donny?

04:01.616 --> 04:02.663
Donny, come stand here.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.001
<i>T minus 15.</i>

04:09.082 --> 04:11.676
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

04:12.377 --> 04:14.004
<i>seven, six...</i>

04:14.171 --> 04:15.423
Thanks for being here.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.255
Are you kidding?

04:17.923 --> 04:18.923
...two...

04:28.143 --> 04:29.486
Oh, it's okay.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.160
What's it doing?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.207
It's working.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.156
Okay, okay.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.909
Ooh, shit.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.834
Ah, I'm exiting the lab.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.717
Oh, ah.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.508
Unidentified male body.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.271
Identified as Dr. Klintsen.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.351
Oh, God.

07:58.937 --> 07:59.937
Shit.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.238
This is Will Porter,
mission log one.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.864
Uncertain as to my coordinates.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.784
The jump was most likely
successful,

08:07.862 --> 08:09.535
but I can't confirm.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.332
Personal BCI non responsive.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.536
New BCI procured,
but battery depleting.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.745
Writing is mirrored.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.874
Either I'm in the echo,
or I've sustained

08:18.957 --> 08:21.255
serious cerebral damage
during jump.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.845
The lab appears
critically damaged.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.056
Destruction appears recent.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.229
Multiple deceased
scattered among the rubble,

08:32.886 --> 08:34.389
including Dr. Klintsen.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.309
Heading outside
to try and confirm coordinates.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.076
This is mission log two,
outside of lab.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.749
More deceased here.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.452
Oh, God.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.394
I have a visual on the tower.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.389
Before executing the objectives,

09:15.472 --> 09:17.395
I need to verify
if this is really the echo.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.397
Shit!

09:33.448 --> 09:34.665
Sorry, buddy.

09:49.172 --> 09:50.264
<i>- Will?</i>
- Abby?

09:50.340 --> 09:52.638
<i>- Oh, my God, Will!</i>
- What...? What happened?

09:52.717 --> 09:54.560
<i>We thought you were dead.
Where are you?</i>

09:55.136 --> 09:56.183
<i>We'll come and get you.</i>

09:56.262 --> 09:57.889
Wait, Abby, I need
to know what happened.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.309
<i>Where have you been?
The lab was attacked, Will.</i>

10:00.391 --> 10:01.608
<i>The box was destroyed.</i>

10:02.102 --> 10:03.621
<i>We moved to a camp
on the outside of...</i>

10:03.645 --> 10:05.365
Wait, back up.
What'd you say about the box?

10:05.772 --> 10:08.116
<i>I said
they destroyed the box.</i>

10:08.399 --> 10:10.572
Destroy it?
How? Who's "they"?

10:11.277 --> 10:13.951
<i>They shot the place up, Will.
I saw it.</i>

10:14.155 --> 10:15.873
Are you sure the box
was destroyed?

10:15.990 --> 10:17.742
<i>I'm sending you
our coordinates.</i>

10:26.709 --> 10:28.427
What the fuck is going on?

10:42.058 --> 10:43.651
<i>Alterplex cares.</i>

10:44.477 --> 10:45.854
<i>We understand.</i>

10:46.688 --> 10:49.441
<i>The future of mankind
is not out there.</i>

10:50.525 --> 10:51.651
<i>It is in here,</i>

10:52.277 --> 10:54.496
<i>and we have found the solution.</i>

10:58.074 --> 11:00.247
<i>We have developed
a clean and simple way</i>

11:00.326 --> 11:02.579
<i>of converting mass
into pure energy.</i>

11:04.330 --> 11:05.582
<i>In just a few more months,</i>

11:05.832 --> 11:07.550
<i>we will launch
our energy tower,</i>

11:08.001 --> 11:10.345
<i>powering our world
for millennia to come.</i>

11:13.423 --> 11:19.101
<i>Alterplex Energy.
Clean. Simple. Safe.</i>

11:58.468 --> 11:59.936
Mr. Porter.

12:03.765 --> 12:06.814
Abigail Vos,
Chief of Alterplex Operations.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.437
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.072
I believe you're familiar
with my partner.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.321
Dr. Klintsen!
This is a great honor, sir.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.244
You know, I was
researching at NASA

12:16.319 --> 12:17.755
when you introduced
duplicate matter theory.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.827
That was the finding
of the decade, sir.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.158
You're a rock star down there.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.417
We are very excited
you're here, Will.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.133
Mr. Reynard apologizes

12:31.209 --> 12:32.927
that he couldn't be
meeting you in person.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.593
Sure. Hi.

12:36.673 --> 12:37.925
I have a lot of questions.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.351
Your people were very good
at keeping me in the dark.

12:41.803 --> 12:44.352
Well, these people
are in the dark, too.

12:52.146 --> 12:56.652
So... A physicist who can fly.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.080
It's no wonder NASA poached you
from the Air Force.

13:02.657 --> 13:03.657
It's impressive.

13:04.409 --> 13:05.911
Thank you.
Sorry, what's going on?

13:05.994 --> 13:07.746
These NASA
assessments claim

13:07.829 --> 13:12.585
you have little
to no risk aversion,

13:13.084 --> 13:15.428
a similar view held by your
flight school instructors.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.597
Those assessments
are classified.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.431
Wait, is this some kind
of a job interview?

13:23.428 --> 13:24.896
'Cause, you know, I appreciate

13:24.971 --> 13:26.073
the mystery flights
and everything,

13:26.097 --> 13:28.270
but I could've saved you all
a lot of time and trouble.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.063
I... I am not interested,
thank you.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.736
You haven't heard our offer.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.028
I have a number of obligations
back in the United States,

13:37.734 --> 13:38.734
personal ones.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.121
We are aware
of your sister and nephew

13:42.030 --> 13:43.703
and your new
surrogate father role.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.417
And the surrounding
circumstances.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.624
It's very noble of you, Will.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.965
Mr. Reynard respects
your position,

13:56.044 --> 13:59.298
Which is why our generous
relocation package

13:59.380 --> 14:01.303
includes all three of you.

14:01.716 --> 14:04.845
Donny will have access
to world-class private school...

14:05.136 --> 14:06.979
It's a little more
complicated than that.

14:07.430 --> 14:10.024
And the finest
trauma specialists

14:10.099 --> 14:11.146
in all of Europe.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.074
With the compensation
we're prepared to offer,

14:18.149 --> 14:20.402
your sister would
never need to work.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.869
Will, this is not a job offer.

14:24.989 --> 14:30.086
This is the opportunity
to explore...

14:32.038 --> 14:34.211
impossible frontiers.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.342
Well, I've already been
to space, so...

14:40.546 --> 14:41.968
Space is possible.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.343
Then, what are we talking about?

14:47.553 --> 14:50.306
Well, for that,
I'm gonna need your signature.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.505
<i>Hi! You've reached Mia
and Donny.</i>

15:18.584 --> 15:19.585
<i>We're not here right now,</i>

15:19.710 --> 15:21.462
<i>so please leave a message</i>

15:21.921 --> 15:25.551
<i>after the... beep!</i>

15:26.759 --> 15:29.433
Mia, it's Will. Just call me
when you get this.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.899
This is Will Porter,
mission log three.

15:33.015 --> 15:36.565
I can now confirm
that the jump was successful.

15:37.228 --> 15:40.858
My location is the echo.
Unprecedented.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.574
This is amazing.

15:55.163 --> 15:59.259
Echo diagnostics is still
loading, currently at 57%.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.428
Answer on gravitational
stability forthcoming.

16:07.258 --> 16:09.010
Eight kilometers from the tower.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.270
ETA, just over an hour.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.581
What the fuck
is going on, man?

16:40.333 --> 16:43.132
Oh, my God.
Just get out of here.

16:44.879 --> 16:47.007
Okay, just get to the tower.
Just get this done.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.259
You can get out of here
and go home, okay?

16:49.759 --> 16:50.851
Oh, crap.

16:55.348 --> 16:59.819
Oh, my God.
What the hell is going on?

17:03.189 --> 17:06.113
<i>It was them.
There was a lot of shouting.</i>

17:06.233 --> 17:08.156
<i>A lot of confusion.</i>

17:08.736 --> 17:10.204
<i>And then they just
starting shooting!</i>

17:10.279 --> 17:11.999
<i>At first, it looked
like they were shooting,</i>

17:12.240 --> 17:13.913
<i>and they were going
after Alterplex guys,</i>

17:14.075 --> 17:16.669
<i>but I saw a woman hit
just getting out of her car,</i>

17:16.743 --> 17:19.338
<i>and I'm pretty sure they had
nothing to do with Alterplex.</i>

17:20.080 --> 17:21.391
<i>The leader
of the militant</i>

17:21.415 --> 17:23.416
<i>environmental group calling
themselves the Rebels,</i>

17:23.501 --> 17:25.595
<i>put out a statement today
justifying their assault</i>

17:25.670 --> 17:27.547
<i>on the Alterplex laboratory
and tower,</i>

17:27.630 --> 17:28.722
<i>accusing the energy plant</i>

17:28.798 --> 17:30.300
<i>of endangering
the entire planet</i>

17:30.383 --> 17:32.385
<i>by turning on
its tower a week ago,</i>

17:32.510 --> 17:35.059
<i>citing the subsequent
destabilization of the system.</i>

17:35.846 --> 17:37.940
<i>Meanwhile, Alterplex,
which has been allowed</i>

17:38.015 --> 17:39.767
<i>to deploy
its own security drones</i>

17:39.850 --> 17:42.694
<i>after issuing the controversial
Alterplex Security Act,</i>

17:43.020 --> 17:44.818
<i>made a joint announcement
with the police</i>

17:44.897 --> 17:46.820
<i>that the evacuation zone
surrounding the tower</i>

17:46.899 --> 17:48.901
<i>has been increased
to 75 kilometers.</i>

18:13.259 --> 18:14.727
Oh, my God, what the...?

18:18.889 --> 18:20.015
Mission log four.

18:20.975 --> 18:24.275
Just had possible visual
on a gravitational anomaly.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.814
And the box is still loading.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.402
Approaching anomaly.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.284
Definitely some sort
of gravitational portal

18:34.363 --> 18:35.706
at the base of the cloud line.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.417
Seems to be active still.
Lots of static charge,

18:38.492 --> 18:42.417
a tendril or a jet,
like a tornado, but ionized.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.625
Moving towards
the anomaly now.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.379
Looks like a small... boat?

18:51.005 --> 18:56.057
Numerous deceased birds
surrounding the anomaly.

18:57.178 --> 18:58.178
All right.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.486
Uh, the boat is mainly intact,

19:05.603 --> 19:11.155
so maybe inverse gravity portal
is still really active.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.827
It seems to be sucking
the atmosphere...

19:13.903 --> 19:16.531
Shit! God!

19:18.074 --> 19:19.417
Oh, my...

19:23.746 --> 19:25.339
Ow!

19:25.831 --> 19:26.923
Shit.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.101
What are you doing?

21:31.248 --> 21:33.000
Drone down!
Drone down!

21:47.807 --> 21:49.229
Everybody regroup!
Come on!

21:50.059 --> 21:52.437
- Who's that guy?
- What? Where?

21:52.520 --> 21:54.614
- Take him out now!
- Wait, wait, wait.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.208
- It's all right. It's okay.
- Move away from the door!

21:56.232 --> 21:57.472
I'm just trying
to find a way...

21:57.775 --> 21:58.919
That's right,
hold your hands high.

21:58.943 --> 22:01.822
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

22:28.472 --> 22:30.190
Stop! Stop it!

22:38.607 --> 22:40.985
I know you're in the house!
I know you're there!

22:41.694 --> 22:43.162
Give you three seconds!

23:35.414 --> 23:36.414
Michael?

23:39.543 --> 23:40.543
Will?

23:40.586 --> 23:41.758
Why are you shooting at me?

23:42.087 --> 23:43.009
You want to put that gun down

23:43.088 --> 23:44.399
and tell me
what the fuck is going on?

23:44.423 --> 23:45.650
What are you doing
with these psychos?

23:45.674 --> 23:46.721
You're Alterplex!

23:48.510 --> 23:49.511
You're alive.

23:51.513 --> 23:52.730
That... that's not possible.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.315
Why not? Why not?

23:54.725 --> 23:55.725
What happened?

23:55.809 --> 23:57.370
Michael, talk to me.
Tell me what you saw.

23:57.394 --> 24:00.113
Tell me, did something
happen to me? Michael?

24:02.858 --> 24:04.252
What the hell
is happening here, man?

24:04.276 --> 24:05.837
- Wait, wait wait...
- What the hell is happening?

24:05.861 --> 24:07.659
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

24:07.738 --> 24:08.965
I'll tell you what's happening,

24:08.989 --> 24:10.366
but first, you gotta answer me!

24:10.908 --> 24:11.908
Bullshit.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.958
How did you survive?
How did you survive?

24:17.706 --> 24:18.706
Shit.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.472
<i>Warning, citizen,</i>

24:32.554 --> 24:34.773
<i>you are trespassing

24:34.974 --> 24:38.649
<i>You are violating
Alterplex Security Act 7.1.</i>

24:38.769 --> 24:41.488
<i>Stop, or we will engage.</i>

24:44.733 --> 24:46.656
<i>You are trespassing
in a restricted area.</i>

24:46.819 --> 24:48.196
<i>Stop, or we will shoot.</i>

24:48.737 --> 24:51.411
I work for Alterplex.
My name is Will Porter.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.541
<i>Remain where you are.</i>

24:53.993 --> 24:55.870
<i>We have that name listed
as deceased.</i>

24:56.328 --> 24:57.625
<i>Take four steps forward</i>

24:57.705 --> 25:00.254
<i>and lay face down,
arms and legs spread.</i>

25:00.374 --> 25:02.342
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me prove it to you.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.170
Let me prove it to you.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.565
<i>Positive identification.
You are under arrest.</i>

25:24.648 --> 25:27.071
<i>Remain where you are.
A transport is on its way.</i>

25:27.151 --> 25:29.950
<i>It will escort you to Alterplex
Command in a few seconds.</i>

25:30.320 --> 25:32.743
<i>Remain where you are.</i>

26:43.560 --> 26:45.483
<i>Since the dawn
of humankind,</i>

26:45.771 --> 26:48.365
<i>we have reached for dreams
beyond our grasp.</i>

26:50.734 --> 26:53.658
<i>We gazed at the birds
and built planes to fly.</i>

26:54.863 --> 26:58.163
<i>We gazed at the moon
and built rockets to reach it.</i>

26:58.992 --> 27:00.915
<i>Throughout history,
we have transcended</i>

27:00.994 --> 27:02.712
<i>our evolution with technology,</i>

27:03.705 --> 27:05.924
<i>pushing through to new frontiers.</i>

27:06.667 --> 27:10.717
<i>Now, Alterplex's visionary CEO,
August Reynard,</i>

27:11.130 --> 27:14.054
<i>asks you to gaze
at the energy challenge we face</i>

27:14.591 --> 27:17.094
<i>and once again push through
to a new frontier.</i>

27:18.011 --> 27:21.265
<i>After decades of research
we are proud to finally unveil</i>

27:21.348 --> 27:23.191
<i>the future of energy harnessing</i>

27:23.433 --> 27:26.186
<i>and realize our dream
for a better tomorrow,</i>

27:27.271 --> 27:29.649
<i>powering us
for millennia to come.</i>

27:47.374 --> 27:50.548
<i>This is a notification
for all Alterplex personnel.</i>

27:50.919 --> 27:54.264
<i>Reminder. Due to the
increased violent protests,</i>

27:54.506 --> 27:56.133
<i>the emergency security policy</i>

27:56.216 --> 27:59.095
<i>will now also include
sectors five...</i>

27:59.261 --> 28:00.729
- Yes!
<i>- ...seven, and ten.</i>

28:00.888 --> 28:02.890
Uh, no, we are not ready at all.

28:02.973 --> 28:06.819
We're still waiting
on the diagnostics report.

28:07.978 --> 28:10.857
Well, I'll check on in.
I'll check him.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.066
Yeah. Okay.

28:17.237 --> 28:18.659
So glad you're here, Will.

28:18.739 --> 28:22.209
I'm sorry,
launch logistics clock is ticking.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.621
How are Mia
and Donny adjusting?

28:26.205 --> 28:29.334
Well, little up and down,
to tell you the truth.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.965
You know, new city
and everything.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.344
They have a lot of questions.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.923
And, frankly, I still
don't fully understand

28:36.006 --> 28:37.349
what I'm doing here myself.

28:37.591 --> 28:42.313
Oh, before we go any further,
this is for you.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.024
It's not a gift, I'm afraid.

28:46.683 --> 28:49.937
It's a locator.
Keep it on at all times.

28:50.020 --> 28:52.990
Once we're live,
you're on call 24/7.

28:54.942 --> 28:58.037
- 24/7?
- Exactly. Shall we proceed?

28:58.237 --> 28:59.409
- All right.
<i>- Reminder.</i>

28:59.488 --> 29:01.035
<i>As we close in
on our launch date...</i>

29:01.573 --> 29:03.621
Ms. Vos, beautiful day,
isn't it?

29:04.493 --> 29:06.871
You must be Will.
Michael.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.168
Welcome to Alterplex.

29:16.546 --> 29:19.641
You can't stay here.
Should keep movin'.

29:19.967 --> 29:21.014
Look at what they've done!

29:21.426 --> 29:23.019
What about
what you did, Michael?

29:23.262 --> 29:24.514
We raided the lab.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.262
What happened to you?

29:26.598 --> 29:27.975
There's a lot of dead people.

29:29.268 --> 29:33.023
You can't be here.
There's just no way...

29:33.689 --> 29:35.862
Why is there no way?
You asked me how I survived.

29:35.941 --> 29:38.114
You said it's not possible
I'm alive. Why?

29:39.569 --> 29:40.946
I saw you die, Will.

29:42.239 --> 29:43.536
I saw you die.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.042
Come on.

29:53.250 --> 29:54.752
What is this?

30:25.991 --> 30:28.164
What in hell is really going on
down here?

30:33.290 --> 30:34.667
Run it, please.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.635
<i>After the end
of fossil fuels,</i>

30:40.797 --> 30:42.174
<i>mankind is faced</i>

30:42.257 --> 30:43.554
<i>with its greatest challenge yet.</i>

30:44.009 --> 30:45.352
<i>With world energy consumption</i>

30:45.552 --> 30:47.520
<i>tripling
in the last decade alone,</i>

30:47.637 --> 30:50.140
<i>a new form of sustainable
energy is needed,</i>

30:50.515 --> 30:54.770
<i>a system that outshines solar,
wind, and even nuclear energy.</i>

30:54.978 --> 30:56.400
<i>After years of research,</i>

30:56.772 --> 30:58.069
<i>we at Alterplex have found</i>

30:58.148 --> 30:59.946
<i>the answer to this energy crisis</i>

31:00.233 --> 31:02.235
<i>by leveraging
the immense hidden power</i>

31:02.319 --> 31:03.320
<i>Of M-theory,</i>

31:03.612 --> 31:06.707
<i>first proposed
by Edward Widden in 1995,</i>

31:07.157 --> 31:08.955
<i>and enhanced
by Peter Klintsen's</i>

31:09.034 --> 31:10.331
<i>duplicate matter theory.</i>

31:10.660 --> 31:13.334
<i>M-theory unifies
all consistent versions</i>

31:13.580 --> 31:14.877
<i>of superstring theory.</i>

31:16.124 --> 31:17.717
<i>By deconstructing space time</i>

31:17.793 --> 31:19.670
<i>into a higher number
of dimensions,</i>

31:20.128 --> 31:21.675
<i>our tower is able to create</i>

31:21.963 --> 31:24.216
<i>a mirrored echo
of our local universe...</i>

31:24.966 --> 31:26.434
You're copying
the entire universe?

31:26.676 --> 31:27.677
<i>...following its symmetry</i>

31:27.761 --> 31:29.729
<i>down to every
last quantum particle,</i>

31:30.180 --> 31:31.523
<i>with one crucial difference:</i>

31:32.265 --> 31:34.063
<i>the echo universe
will be devoid</i>

31:34.142 --> 31:35.644
<i>of organic compounds.</i>

31:36.103 --> 31:38.322
<i>Instead, it will be
a lifeless cosmos,</i>

31:38.688 --> 31:40.816
<i>providing a limitless amount
of matter</i>

31:40.899 --> 31:43.027
<i>that can be transformed
into power.</i>

31:43.443 --> 31:45.537
<i>Acting as a dimensional
conductor,</i>

31:45.821 --> 31:48.700
<i>the tower will create
multiple gravity portals</i>

31:49.157 --> 31:50.625
<i>which will harvest
the echo's mass</i>

31:50.826 --> 31:53.750
<i>and convert it into pure
electromagnetic energy.</i>

31:54.955 --> 31:56.707
<i>This energy will
then be transferred</i>

31:56.790 --> 31:58.963
<i>cleanly and safely
into our world,</i>

31:59.501 --> 32:01.879
<i>powering it
for millennia to come.</i>

32:08.343 --> 32:10.186
I had the exact same face.

32:11.555 --> 32:14.525
- Parallel universes?
- An echo universe.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.820
And this here
is where you come in.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.197
This is the gate.

32:21.481 --> 32:24.610
It sends you into the echo
a safe distance from the tower.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.991
You will be carrying this box.

32:28.822 --> 32:31.621
The box will counterbalance
any instabilities

32:31.700 --> 32:34.169
- that might occur in the echo.
- Instabilities?

32:35.245 --> 32:38.419
Very simple, though it plugs
right into the echo tower.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.506
Someone needs to get it there.

32:42.210 --> 32:45.054
Huh. May I?

32:55.140 --> 32:56.437
And just plug it in?

32:58.810 --> 32:59.810
That's it?

33:00.353 --> 33:01.400
That's it.

33:01.938 --> 33:04.487
There's a terminal at the base
of the echo tower.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.864
You jump over,
take the box to the tower,

33:07.068 --> 33:10.447
plug it in, and jump back
in time for dinner.

33:24.211 --> 33:25.521
Michael,
nobody was supposed

33:25.545 --> 33:27.047
to have been copied,
no living thing.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.566
This was supposed
to be a sterile world,

33:28.590 --> 33:29.637
devoid of carbon life.

33:29.758 --> 33:30.918
I don't know what went wrong.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.219
So you're saying that...

33:33.094 --> 33:34.094
Hmm?

33:35.013 --> 33:36.606
They've copied
the entire world.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.809
- Well... kind of.
- The entire universe.

33:39.518 --> 33:40.815
How's that even possible, man?

33:40.894 --> 33:43.147
You really don't
want to get into that right now,

33:43.230 --> 33:45.733
but, effectively, yes. Yes.

33:49.277 --> 33:50.494
So there's two of me.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.205
Possibly.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.583
- Of everyone.
- Well, not everyone.

33:54.658 --> 33:57.252
Not me, anymore, I guess,
but I'm here to fix that.

33:57.327 --> 34:00.080
I have to get this
to the tower.

34:01.373 --> 34:02.545
Huh...

34:05.835 --> 34:08.588
"Redivider."
What does it mean?

34:08.880 --> 34:09.722
I don't know.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.471
They didn't brief me
on Redivider.

34:13.217 --> 34:14.777
What about shit
like this, man?

34:15.094 --> 34:16.455
They never briefed you
about trains

34:16.513 --> 34:17.981
falling out
of the fucking sky.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.188
Listen, the system
should've been one way,

34:22.226 --> 34:23.945
harvesting energy
from the echo,

34:24.228 --> 34:26.572
from this universe
into the real world,

34:26.648 --> 34:29.025
but maybe the echo
is fighting back somehow?

34:29.150 --> 34:30.527
It's sucking stuff back?

34:30.985 --> 34:32.862
Heavy objects
from the real world...

34:33.071 --> 34:34.869
Maybe it's balancing out
what's lost.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.746
Jesus Christ.

34:37.951 --> 34:39.578
No one's going to believe this.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.501
Because no one is
gonna know.

34:43.456 --> 34:45.268
- What do you mean?
- Can you imagine the panic?

34:45.292 --> 34:47.411
Look what's happening already.
People would freak out.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.219
We have to say something.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.047
No, we don't have to say shit.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.007
Goddamn!

34:53.717 --> 34:54.985
Look, if you really want
to end this,

34:55.010 --> 34:57.388
you have to help me
get the box to the tower.

35:00.140 --> 35:01.642
- Shit! Who's this?
- Michael!

35:01.725 --> 35:02.851
Michael, put the gun down.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.070
- Abby. Abby!
- What the...

35:08.189 --> 35:09.907
Michael, easy. Easy.

35:11.151 --> 35:13.495
This is crazy.
They destroyed the lab, Will.

35:13.695 --> 35:15.381
- You destroyed the goddamn wor...
- Shut up!

35:15.405 --> 35:16.452
Shut the fuck up!

35:17.574 --> 35:19.451
We cannot trust her, Will.
Don't trust her.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.461
Reynard is waiting
with what's left of the team.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.460
- We're regrouping.
- No, no...

35:24.539 --> 35:26.633
- The plan failed, Will, badly.
- I know.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.464
Come with me,
and we will fix this.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.671
Abby, no. Abby, I can't.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.892
- Gotta go.
<i>- You have been identified.</i>

35:40.180 --> 35:42.854
<i>Lie on the ground and place
your hands over your head.</i>

35:43.683 --> 35:47.733
Hey, it's me! What the fuck
is wrong with you?

35:47.812 --> 35:48.984
I'm bringing him in!

35:50.482 --> 35:51.859
Go, go, go! Run!

35:52.984 --> 35:54.736
<i>We see you. Lie on the ground</i>

35:54.819 --> 35:56.366
<i>and place your hands
over your head.</i>

35:56.780 --> 35:58.532
<i>This is your last warning.</i>

36:02.952 --> 36:04.670
- Come back!
- No!

36:10.418 --> 36:13.092
Get in the car!
Come on, get in!

36:16.716 --> 36:18.810
Abby, let's go! Come on!

36:23.306 --> 36:24.808
Run! Come on!

36:30.105 --> 36:31.277
Goddamn you!

36:33.900 --> 36:35.072
He's coming in!

36:38.113 --> 36:39.113
Shoot!

36:40.323 --> 36:41.323
Come on!

36:43.159 --> 36:44.411
Shoot it!

36:45.954 --> 36:47.752
Oh, God, it's damaging the hull!

36:47.956 --> 36:49.708
- Are you out?
- It's out. It's out.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.464
My pack. Use the grenade.

36:55.088 --> 36:56.886
Throw the grenade!
Throw the grenade!

37:04.639 --> 37:06.562
Get to that bridge faster.
Faster!

37:12.731 --> 37:13.731
Shit!

37:46.389 --> 37:47.389
Unmute.

37:47.557 --> 37:50.310
<i>The disappearance is the latest
in a line of recent reports</i>

37:50.393 --> 37:51.485
<i>of vehicles gone missing,</i>

37:51.853 --> 37:53.571
<i>a bizarre pattern which seems</i>

37:53.646 --> 37:55.523
<i>to be linked to abnormal
weather behaviors</i>

37:55.648 --> 37:57.946
<i>surrounding the sites,
according to some experts.</i>

37:58.485 --> 38:00.533
<i>Some skeptics believe
the events are linked</i>

38:00.612 --> 38:03.161
<i>to the Alterplex Energy tower
launch last week.</i>

38:03.406 --> 38:04.749
He wanted to wait up for you.

38:04.949 --> 38:07.122
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.001
We'll get to it
this weekend, I promise.

38:11.498 --> 38:13.000
They're giving you
weekends off now?

38:24.552 --> 38:25.929
I think he's
a little homesick.

38:27.096 --> 38:28.143
Yeah?

38:29.224 --> 38:31.226
Well, it'll get better.

38:39.108 --> 38:40.576
And I swear I'm
gonna do something

38:40.652 --> 38:42.370
about all this stuff.

38:44.739 --> 38:45.786
Okay?

38:52.163 --> 38:54.291
You should get out
and enjoy the city a bit.

38:56.125 --> 38:57.798
Have you taken him
on the canals yet?

38:59.003 --> 39:00.471
We'll be fine, Will.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.091
You okay?

40:29.052 --> 40:30.178
Bleeding. Shit.

40:30.511 --> 40:32.434
It's fine.
It's fine.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.024
You all right?

40:39.187 --> 40:41.290
We have to bring you to Reynard.
He'll know what to do.

40:41.314 --> 40:43.567
Reynard and his team just tried
to put us in a coma!

40:43.650 --> 40:45.072
Because you attacked us!

40:48.237 --> 40:50.990
- Will?
- They were aiming at me, Abby.

40:56.329 --> 40:57.672
Why? You're one of us.

40:57.997 --> 40:59.294
Not anymore, Abby.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.421
Just get me into the tower.

41:03.252 --> 41:05.846
The tower. What are you gonna
do without the box?

41:05.922 --> 41:06.923
They destroyed it!

41:07.215 --> 41:09.263
Just trust me.
I can fix this.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.182
He can fix it.

41:14.097 --> 41:16.099
But without Reynard
and Alterplex.

41:16.182 --> 41:17.354
Without them!

41:18.309 --> 41:19.777
We're getting
in there, Abby.

41:20.603 --> 41:23.573
I can end this, all right?

41:24.315 --> 41:25.817
He can end it.

41:28.277 --> 41:29.277
Okay.

41:30.363 --> 41:31.363
Will.

42:05.606 --> 42:07.859
<i>Hi! You've reached Mia
and Donny.</i>

42:07.942 --> 42:08.943
<i>We're not here right now,</i>

42:09.027 --> 42:10.779
<i>so please leave a message</i>

42:11.237 --> 42:14.958
<i>after the... beep!</i>

42:15.491 --> 42:17.539
Mia, it's me again.

42:17.952 --> 42:19.374
Please call me
as soon as you can.

42:19.704 --> 42:21.456
Okay? I love you.

42:21.539 --> 42:22.836
They evacuated.

42:23.291 --> 42:25.043
I made sure of it myself.

42:30.757 --> 42:32.509
Drone patrolling the building.

42:37.180 --> 42:38.180
Shh.

42:45.146 --> 42:46.146
Fuck.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.660
We have to move out
of the open. Go!

43:07.168 --> 43:08.168
Shh.

43:23.142 --> 43:24.142
Safe.

43:25.937 --> 43:27.109
Let's go!

43:33.236 --> 43:34.488
<i>We are not the military.</i>

43:34.695 --> 43:36.697
<i>We are an energy corporation.</i>

43:36.948 --> 43:39.201
<i>Now, the rebels,
they're anarchists!</i>

43:39.367 --> 43:40.594
<i>This statement given</i>

43:40.618 --> 43:42.620
<i>by Alterplex CEO
August Reynard</i>

43:42.745 --> 43:44.463
<i>condemning
the environmental group</i>

43:44.580 --> 43:45.422
<i>which attacked...</i>

43:45.498 --> 43:46.750
If you find any water,
take it.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.594
<i>...viewed as highly
controversial.</i>

43:50.419 --> 43:52.717
<i>News reports from the city
are hard to verify</i>

43:52.797 --> 43:55.266
<i>due to the strictly enforced
exclusion zone.</i>

43:55.716 --> 43:57.969
<i>Vehicles seemly appearing out
of thin air</i>

43:58.052 --> 43:59.269
<i>and dropping from the sky</i>

43:59.345 --> 44:01.598
<i>sound like ideas out
of science fiction,</i>

44:02.140 --> 44:04.893
<i>yet many eyewitnesses
have reported these phenomenon.</i>

44:05.560 --> 44:06.578
<i>The authorities are taking</i>

44:06.602 --> 44:08.775
<i>These accounts
very, very seriously...</i>

44:26.914 --> 44:29.087
Jesus Christ.

44:33.337 --> 44:34.884
Oh, my God.

44:43.347 --> 44:44.940
Who moved these bodies here?

44:46.350 --> 44:47.476
Oh, God.

44:48.811 --> 44:53.317
Alterplex.
Alterplex Security, for sure.

44:53.774 --> 44:55.196
I've seen similar sites.

44:55.651 --> 44:57.254
At first, we thought
it was just a freak thing,

44:57.278 --> 44:59.997
but then they kept
coming and coming.

45:00.865 --> 45:03.084
After a while, just gave up.

45:03.492 --> 45:05.165
I didn't even know
about this one.

45:05.745 --> 45:07.873
Too many bodies.
That's when I quit.

45:08.664 --> 45:10.132
I don't blame you.

45:15.046 --> 45:16.798
On the other side...

45:19.926 --> 45:21.143
is it like this?

45:21.427 --> 45:24.271
No, just these vehicles
went missing.

45:25.139 --> 45:26.857
That's why Alterplex sent me.

45:26.933 --> 45:28.185
So, it's not...

45:31.812 --> 45:33.109
I'm not...?

45:33.189 --> 45:38.320
Like I said, as far as I know,
the other you is alive.

45:41.364 --> 45:44.459
I don't know. Jesus.

45:45.701 --> 45:47.123
You okay?

45:51.499 --> 45:52.751
Shit!

45:53.751 --> 45:54.831
This way, this way!

45:55.294 --> 45:56.420
We got a drone!

45:56.963 --> 45:59.682
He spotted us!
Aw, shit!

45:59.882 --> 46:01.762
Let's get in the plane!
Let's go! Come on!

46:02.301 --> 46:03.678
Let's go, let's go! Come on!

46:07.723 --> 46:10.647
<i>...require ground support
at grid two.</i>

46:13.688 --> 46:16.316
<i>...require ground support
at grid two.</i>

46:19.402 --> 46:21.996
Stay down. Stay down.

46:41.340 --> 46:42.762
<i>Stand by for final position.</i>

46:42.925 --> 46:44.427
On red and shoot to kill.

46:44.510 --> 46:45.807
Repeat, shoot to kill.

46:45.886 --> 46:47.763
Visual on targets. Engaging.

47:15.541 --> 47:16.541
- You okay?
- Yeah.

47:16.667 --> 47:19.671
Okay. Goddamn.

47:29.305 --> 47:30.602
We have to go.

47:34.477 --> 47:36.479
Go. Let's go.

47:37.438 --> 47:39.566
Move! They know where we are.

47:45.529 --> 47:46.529
You okay?

47:47.907 --> 47:48.907
We're clear.

47:49.825 --> 47:51.077
Whew!

47:51.911 --> 47:53.208
Goddamn it.

47:55.122 --> 47:57.170
Drone! Drone!

47:57.792 --> 48:00.796
<i>Face the drone and place
your weapon on the ground.</i>

48:01.629 --> 48:04.724
Back me up, Will!
Back me up!

48:06.801 --> 48:08.724
Shit! I'm out.

48:13.557 --> 48:16.811
Charge your rifle, Will!
Fire the charge!

48:21.816 --> 48:22.816
Look out!

48:55.266 --> 48:56.358
What's it doing?

49:00.146 --> 49:01.238
It's working.

49:11.031 --> 49:13.705
Hey, Donny, you see that?
See that beam of light?

49:15.119 --> 49:16.336
That is pure energy

49:16.454 --> 49:18.331
that has been sucked
down into the tower.

49:18.414 --> 49:20.462
That's gonna power
the whole city here,

49:20.541 --> 49:21.758
maybe the whole country.

49:22.585 --> 49:23.962
Sucking it from where?

49:24.545 --> 49:26.263
Well...

49:26.672 --> 49:29.050
<i>Will Porter,
you are now on call.</i>

49:31.802 --> 49:33.896
<i>The group's leader,
Hugo Romein,</i>

49:34.013 --> 49:36.357
<i>in an interview this morning
ensured that his movement</i>

49:36.432 --> 49:38.275
<i>will be monitoring
the situation closely.</i>

49:38.642 --> 49:41.361
<i>Expressing grave concerns
about the tower initiation,</i>

49:42.062 --> 49:43.564
<i>he went on to vow
that his group</i>

49:43.647 --> 49:45.649
<i>would take action
at the first sign of trouble,</i>

49:45.900 --> 49:46.901
<i>although he did not say</i>

49:46.984 --> 49:48.657
<i>what form that action
would take.</i>

49:55.743 --> 49:56.783
Will...

49:57.661 --> 49:59.880
Will, listen, stay with me.

50:02.666 --> 50:04.339
- Stay with me.
- Shit...

50:05.544 --> 50:06.704
We've gotta pull
it out, okay?

50:06.837 --> 50:09.215
Abby, we pull it out.

50:12.009 --> 50:13.135
The blood'll be worse.

50:13.219 --> 50:14.219
<i>One, two...</i>

50:15.971 --> 50:18.565
Stop, stop. He'll bleed
to death if you pull it out.

50:20.142 --> 50:21.439
You think that you can walk?

50:21.769 --> 50:24.272
There's no way
he'll make it to the tower.

50:24.813 --> 50:26.486
We need to get
him real help.

50:27.274 --> 50:29.868
Will, Will, Will,
stay with us.

50:30.778 --> 50:33.531
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, I know a place.

50:34.073 --> 50:35.575
It's just a few blocks
from here.

50:37.743 --> 50:39.040
A place?

50:49.255 --> 50:50.928
No, no, no, it's me.
It's Michael.

50:51.173 --> 50:52.516
I got an injured man here.

50:54.301 --> 50:55.598
Carry him.

50:56.887 --> 50:58.855
You brought us here?

51:00.683 --> 51:02.105
I had no choice.

51:02.309 --> 51:03.309
Okay?

51:03.561 --> 51:04.858
He's bleeding to death.

51:06.981 --> 51:08.358
Weapons down, please.

51:09.066 --> 51:10.568
Weapons down, come on!

51:10.651 --> 51:12.779
His name's Will.
Where's Hugo?

51:12.903 --> 51:13.903
Will.

51:13.946 --> 51:15.289
Come on, all
your weapons down.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.074
Where's Hugo?

51:21.328 --> 51:22.408
That's not my problem.

51:22.454 --> 51:23.296
I'd tell you,

51:23.372 --> 51:24.975
but we need the medic
before he bleeds out.

51:24.999 --> 51:27.001
- I'm telling you, Hugo!
- Okay.

51:41.515 --> 51:42.892
Come on,
leave her alone.

51:43.267 --> 51:44.894
Don't you
fucking touch me.

51:45.185 --> 51:47.187
- Shit...
- She's unarmed.

51:55.779 --> 51:59.033
Okay. Take them inside.

52:00.451 --> 52:01.668
Clear the table, come on!

52:09.001 --> 52:10.469
Sit down, Will.

52:11.962 --> 52:13.885
Look out
for your leg. Up!

52:17.051 --> 52:19.930
Please be careful with him.
We need him.

52:23.474 --> 52:24.896
Is the muscle damaged?

52:26.727 --> 52:29.651
Give him a shot of propofol
and IV floxacillin.

52:29.772 --> 52:30.648
Okay.

52:30.731 --> 52:32.449
Fixate his leg.
Okay, now, gently.

52:33.317 --> 52:34.409
One, two...

52:36.278 --> 52:37.450
Yeah, it's not working.

52:37.988 --> 52:39.205
We need to apply
side pressure.

52:39.281 --> 52:40.281
Okay, try it again.

52:40.366 --> 52:41.366
Oh...

52:43.827 --> 52:46.376
- Shit. Oh, it's out.
- Okay.

52:47.790 --> 52:50.259
Try to relax, bro.
Try to relax.

52:55.589 --> 52:58.092
- Hand me the scissors?
- Trust me, you're gonna be okay.

52:58.717 --> 53:01.266
I'll prepare the leg, make sure
he doesn't lose too much blood.

53:04.139 --> 53:05.732
Yep, prepare the leg.

53:06.433 --> 53:07.480
On my count.

53:07.559 --> 53:09.778
Gauze. Nurse, gauze, please.

53:34.503 --> 53:36.926
Couple of minutes,
you'll be as good as new.

54:00.320 --> 54:02.368
<i>Who will stand up for her?</i>

54:03.115 --> 54:05.083
<i>Who speaks for Earth</i>

54:05.451 --> 54:08.330
<i>when multinationals exploit
her resources for profit?</i>

54:09.580 --> 54:12.174
<i>Who speaks
for our planet when...</i>

54:12.249 --> 54:13.876
- Mia?
<i>- ...rape her</i>

54:13.959 --> 54:17.463
<i>while pulling the wool
over everyone's eyes?</i>

54:19.715 --> 54:21.809
Mia, what are you
watching this for?

54:23.469 --> 54:25.267
Mia, what's the matter?

54:28.766 --> 54:32.361
Nothing, I'm...
I'm fine. I'm sorry.

54:40.194 --> 54:41.867
Donny wrote this today.

54:48.452 --> 54:50.671
Are the kids still
teasing him at school?

54:51.205 --> 54:52.707
It's not the teasing, Will.

54:53.081 --> 54:55.880
It's this whole place,
this situation,

54:55.959 --> 54:58.087
these things
that are happening.

55:03.050 --> 55:07.556
You've been so good to us,
and you don't owe us anything,

55:07.638 --> 55:09.766
and I think maybe
it's time that...

55:11.099 --> 55:12.099
No.

55:13.310 --> 55:14.310
Come on.

55:15.270 --> 55:16.915
I don't want Donny and I
to stand in the way

55:16.939 --> 55:18.737
of something
that's so important to you.

55:22.778 --> 55:26.828
Mia, if he misses home,
we'll go back on a trip.

55:34.164 --> 55:35.882
Let me go talk to him, okay?

56:20.669 --> 56:22.546
- Hey!
- What happ... what?

56:23.338 --> 56:24.510
How long have I been out?

56:24.882 --> 56:25.882
Who are you?

56:25.924 --> 56:28.768
No, we have to...
we don't have a lot of time.

56:37.185 --> 56:38.185
- Hey.
- Whoa, easy.

56:38.854 --> 56:39.855
Who are you?

56:40.230 --> 56:41.447
You have to let us go.

56:41.523 --> 56:43.025
We need to get
out of here right now.

56:43.150 --> 56:45.152
You work for Alterplex,
just like her?

56:45.652 --> 56:47.199
You need to let us go now.

56:47.404 --> 56:48.404
Tell him.

56:48.822 --> 56:50.369
- Tell him.
- Yeah, tell me.

56:52.200 --> 56:55.454
- Who do you work for?
- What? Come on, Michael.

56:55.537 --> 56:59.041
- Tell him.
- Michael. Michael, come on.

56:59.499 --> 57:01.139
We need to go.
We need to get out of here.

57:01.209 --> 57:02.461
Who is this guy?

57:07.132 --> 57:08.224
What are you doing?

57:09.134 --> 57:12.058
No, no, no. Don't.
What are you do...?

57:12.638 --> 57:14.265
Are you listening to me?
We have to go!

57:14.473 --> 57:16.191
We have to get
that thing to the tower!

57:16.266 --> 57:17.266
Redivider?

57:18.393 --> 57:19.394
What is this?

57:19.478 --> 57:20.604
That's impossible.

57:20.854 --> 57:22.231
What is not possible?

57:24.191 --> 57:26.410
What is this?
Come on.

57:26.693 --> 57:28.161
You bring
these people in here,

57:28.236 --> 57:30.113
and you can't explain
what this is?

57:30.280 --> 57:32.157
Hugo, he told me
he could help.

57:32.240 --> 57:34.584
- Did you sell us out, Mike?
- No, I swear.

57:34.660 --> 57:36.378
- Did you sell us out?
- No, I didn't.

57:36.578 --> 57:38.421
Trust me,
I know what I'm doing.

57:41.375 --> 57:43.628
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- They can help.

57:43.919 --> 57:46.468
- Hugo, trust me.
- They can help?

57:46.880 --> 57:49.349
Help bring us
this tracking device here?

57:49.883 --> 57:51.476
Help us all get killed?

57:52.678 --> 57:54.931
What is this?

57:57.140 --> 57:58.140
Shit!

58:00.811 --> 58:01.903
Where's the box?

58:05.315 --> 58:07.235
Michael, come on.
We gotta get out of here.

58:07.776 --> 58:09.244
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

58:09.695 --> 58:11.572
Come on, guys, move! Move!

58:12.698 --> 58:14.951
Move! Move!
Come on, this way.

58:16.785 --> 58:18.985
Michael, let's go.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

58:21.999 --> 58:23.601
I don't believe
they won't believe me.

58:23.625 --> 58:25.343
Abby, come on!

58:28.964 --> 58:30.216
Let's go, go, go!

58:31.341 --> 58:33.435
- Come on, move in!
- Michael.

58:33.552 --> 58:34.394
<i>Attention,</i>

58:34.469 --> 58:36.392

a wanted individual.</i>

58:36.638 --> 58:37.480
<i>You are in breach</i>

58:37.556 --> 58:39.684
<i>of the active Alterplex
security order.</i>

58:44.604 --> 58:46.698
Shit.

58:46.773 --> 58:49.322
Stay down, stay down. Okay.

58:51.111 --> 58:52.658
Yeah. Let's go.

58:53.530 --> 58:55.783
Go, go, go, go, go!
Abby, come on.

59:04.332 --> 59:05.332
Clear!

59:07.127 --> 59:08.003
This way!

59:08.086 --> 59:11.431
Abby. Abby! I couldn't
tell you about the box.

59:12.841 --> 59:14.434
I know an escape tunnel nearby!

59:19.473 --> 59:20.850
Shit. Let's go! Come on!

59:21.433 --> 59:22.810
Drone left!

59:26.855 --> 59:28.107
Give me the box, Will.

59:28.231 --> 59:29.951
Gotta move!
We gotta move, come on!

59:30.067 --> 59:32.320
Why are you standing there?
Come on! Come on!

59:33.570 --> 59:36.164
We gotta go down.
Come on in, quick.

59:38.408 --> 59:42.458
Abby. Abby!
What was I supposed to do?

59:43.455 --> 59:45.002
Abby, what was
I supposed to do?

59:45.082 --> 59:46.362
I couldn't tell you
about the box

59:46.416 --> 59:47.838
once I knew
I was in the echo.

59:48.919 --> 59:50.466
You weren't even supposed
to be here!

59:50.545 --> 59:52.468
Nobody was supposed
to be alive here. Stop!

59:52.547 --> 59:54.925
No, you stop. Redivider...

59:56.384 --> 59:57.886
What is Redivider?

59:58.762 --> 01:00:00.639
Huh? What is it?

01:00:01.723 --> 01:00:04.351
You sent me here.
You sent me here.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.983
Now, you tell me
what is Redivider.

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:10.365
It's a classified protocol,
a last resort.

01:00:12.234 --> 01:00:14.657
When restoring balance
is impossible...

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:19.700
the box disables
one side altogether.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.161
It destroys the tower.

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:27.670
And this universe.

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:32.217
There's only one option left.

01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:39.971
Redivider aborts one universe
to ensure the other survives.

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:44.229
Jesus Christ.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:47.861
This thing is
a goddamn kill switch.

01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:17.139
Hey, bud.

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:49.626
I got your note.

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.804
And I miss home, too.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.898
Truth is, Don...

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:11.520
I don't even really know
where home is anymore.

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:17.655
<i>Will Porter, please call in
as soon as possible.</i>

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:33.296
You know, Donny, there are
a lot of very important,

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:36.712
very smart people
in these towers.

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:39.969
And they wanted Uncle Will

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:43.101
to move halfway
across the world...

01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:46.855
Move our home
halfway across the world...

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:50.392
to be part
of a very special project.

01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:55.655
It's something that could help
a lot of people, you know?

01:02:57.941 --> 01:02:59.488
Maybe even change the world.

01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:07.788
And I thought maybe I could
help you and your mom, too.

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:12.546
That's a big responsibility.

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:18.761
It's maybe the biggest responsibility
of my life.

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.305
<i>Will Porter, please call in
as soon as possible.</i>

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:40.399
Really?

01:03:44.612 --> 01:03:45.659
For me?

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:53.754
Thanks, man.

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:06.851
<i>So, you sent me
on a suicide mission?</i>

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:09.684
I am tired of being
fucked around, Abby.

01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:10.810
I am done!

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:16.315
Where did my family go, huh?
Where are they, Abby?

01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:20.528
Will, where are you going?

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:22.530
Oh, shit!
What's happening?

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:33.127
Where are you going?

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:34.796
You said they evacuated, right?

01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:37.048
Donny, my sister,
they evacuated.

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:40.427
Will, this is a bad idea.

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:41.628
I am too close to home.

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:43.338
No, you're not
thinking clearly.

01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:47.767
This is a bad idea.

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:53.265
It's getting worse.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:09.239
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:12.917
It's... it's like it's coming apart
at the seams! What the...?

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:23.048
- Holy shit!
- I gotta get to them!

01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:24.386
Don't go!

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:36.307
Please stay with us.

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:37.691
Get out of my way!

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:48.278
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:51.119
Oh, my God. Mia!

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:54.580
Mia! Donny!

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:56.536
<i>I should never have
dragged you guys here.</i>

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:00.289
I am done.

01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:02.171
- Done?
- Yeah.

01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:04.503
I've been so selfish.

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:21.276
We're gonna
get through this.

01:06:21.352 --> 01:06:23.730
I don't wanna just
get through this, Mia.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.198
<i>You and Donny
deserve way better.</i>

01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:31.989
Please, I didn't mean
for this to become a big thing.

01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:34.040
Mia, it's a huge deal.

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:36.334
You're my sister,

01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:37.511
and I promised
to look after you.

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:38.535
I... I...

01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:42.002
I don't feel like I've done
a very good job.

01:06:44.876 --> 01:06:47.595
We're going home, all of us.

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:50.214
Are you sure?

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:51.682
First thing in the morning.

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:53.718
I'm gonna quit and...

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:56.847
we'll get on the first plane
out of here, okay?

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.732
Thank you.

01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:28.928
What kind of person are you?

01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:30.846
You said they evacuated.

01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:33.095
You said you made sure
of it yourself.

01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:34.592
You lied to me.

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:39.101
What's that?
What's it doing?

01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:47.187
I'm sorry.

01:07:51.776 --> 01:07:52.823
Wait here.

01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:59.951
Shit!

01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:14.056
What the hell's going on?

01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:20.768
Critical failure of protocol!
You're going in!

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:21.930
Will!

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.478
I guess that resignation'll
have to wait. I'm sorry.

01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:28.111
Where are they taking you?

01:08:28.313 --> 01:08:30.941
Porter, you have to go now!

01:08:33.568 --> 01:08:34.568
Will!

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.328
Will!

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.138
Traitor.

01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:03.981
We got Porter.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.359
<i>What about the box?
Is it safe?</i>

01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:16.535
Yeah, it's safe.

01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:17.908
<i>Good. Good.</i>

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.214
<i>Don't let it out of your sight.</i>

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:20.581
What should I do with him?

01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:22.582
<i>Just like we discussed.</i>

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:23.658
Copy.

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:13.008
Take him up front.

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:12.851
Hello, Will.

01:11:12.977 --> 01:11:14.650
Whatever he says,
don't listen to him.

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:17.072
Don't trust him.

01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:18.616
Jordan, let's go.

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:27.909
It's an interesting...

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:31.621
strange...

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:36.130
beautiful paradox.

01:11:38.377 --> 01:11:43.258
Those two worlds
conjoined like twins...

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.052
just from the womb.

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:50.648
We have to sacrifice one...

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.942
so the other may endure.

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:59.820
You're going to sacrifice
the original universe.

01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:04.912
You're destroying
my world so you can live?

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:07.199
Fuck you.

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:12.788
We need your help, Will.

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:14.463
There is still time.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:15.665
Time for what?

01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:18.042
You think I'd actually help you?

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:20.674
With everything I know now?

01:12:21.546 --> 01:12:22.546
I know.

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:24.762
This is a difficult decision.

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:26.968
Difficult? Difficult?!

01:12:27.426 --> 01:12:29.303
Killing my family
is difficult?

01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:34.567
That's why going back
is the only solution.

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:36.940
You can see them again.

01:12:37.395 --> 01:12:40.114
You're the only one
who can pilot the jump.

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:42.901
There is no third option.

01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:46.992
If we remain here
in this stalemate,

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.954
both worlds
soon cease to exist.

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:52.876
We have to sacrifice one
to save the other.

01:12:56.247 --> 01:13:01.094
Yes. Yes, Mr. Porter,
your family will die.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:04.305
I'm only offering you
the opportunity to be there.

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:09.140
Hold their hands in the end.

01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:31.707
One must be sacrificed
so the other can live.

01:13:33.326 --> 01:13:34.498
That works for me.

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:37.084
Michael, hold on
to something now!

01:16:06.771 --> 01:16:08.068
There.

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:20.455
What happened?

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:23.913
Where is Porter?

01:16:25.998 --> 01:16:27.170
Where is the box?

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:28.835
Where is the box?

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:32.839
Shoot me.
Shoot me.

01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:37.532
Take this.
We gotta move.

01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:38.988
You know
what I need to do, right?

01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:40.740
Exactly what you've gotta do.

01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:42.157
You know what this means?

01:17:42.533 --> 01:17:44.706
Kill switch.
That's okay.

01:17:45.119 --> 01:17:47.121
I need to right
some wrongs, anyway.

01:18:20.154 --> 01:18:21.451
He's still shooting!

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:26.043
Drive! Drive!

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:28.878
Hold on!

01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:37.929
Michael, you okay?

01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:39.840
Oh, shit, I'm hit! I'm hit!

01:18:40.591 --> 01:18:41.968
Stop the car.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:45.896
Here, you take the wheel.

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:48.682
Let's go.

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:54.113
Let's go! Move!

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:40.368
Will!
Will, are you okay?

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:44.821
Will?

01:19:45.739 --> 01:19:46.739
Shit!

01:19:46.865 --> 01:19:48.333
Shit, drones!

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:50.411
Shoot!

01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:04.387
Will, shoot the nose.
Shoot the nose!

01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:09.354
Shoot the nose!

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:11.649
It controls the other drones.
Come on, Will!

01:20:32.369 --> 01:20:34.872
Look, we're almost there.

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:07.621
Oh, shit!

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:11.910
You get to the tower, Will,
and you end this!

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.294
You end this, Will!

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:59.999
<i>Truth is, Donny,
they wanted Uncle Will</i>

01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:03.090
<i>to be part
of a very special project.</i>

01:22:08.132 --> 01:22:11.011
<i>It's something that could help
a lot of people, you know?</i>

01:22:13.554 --> 01:22:15.227
<i>Maybe even change the world.</i>

01:22:19.393 --> 01:22:23.273
<i>And I thought maybe I could
help you and your mom, too.</i>

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:28.076
<i>That's a big responsibility.</i>

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:35.677
<i>It's maybe
the biggest responsibility</i>

01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:36.701
<i>of my life.</i>

01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:39.931
<i>I don't want Donny
and I to stand in the way</i>

01:22:39.955 --> 01:22:41.628
<i>of something that's
so important to you.</i>

01:22:44.918 --> 01:22:46.795
<i>I've been so selfish.</i>

01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:52.343
<i>You've been
so good to us,</i>

01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:55.100
<i>and you don't
owe us anything,</i>

01:22:55.179 --> 01:22:56.852
<i>and I think maybe it's time...</i>

01:22:58.182 --> 01:23:01.436
<i>If he misses home,
we'll go back on a trip.</i>
