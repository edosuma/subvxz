02:55.542 --> 02:57.125
Come on. Look at here.

02:58.042 --> 02:59.208
Good.

03:00.375 --> 03:02.000
Oh, ling ling ling

03:56.208 --> 03:57.792
We are tourists.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.625
(Korean) Hello.  (Japanese) Hello.

04:04.458 --> 04:06.083
(Japanese) Hello.   (Korean) Hello.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.792
You are paparazzi.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.667
No. We are journalists.

04:13.167 --> 04:14.625
Hand the photos over to me.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.125
It is my right to take... take photos.

04:17.125 --> 04:18.666
You can't stop me.

04:18.666 --> 04:20.083
Keep away from me,

04:20.083 --> 04:21.916
or else I...I will sue you for indecent assault.

04:23.167 --> 04:25.333
Right? Ridiculous!

04:25.333 --> 04:26.667
Give the photos back to me.

04:26.667 --> 04:27.417
Hey, don't fight.

04:27.833 --> 04:30.917
Hey, let me go.

04:30.917 --> 04:32.458
The camera is pricy.

04:32.458 --> 04:33.250
A man as you are,

04:33.250 --> 04:34.708
you should not rob a woman.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.125
Right. You are shameless.

04:36.125 --> 04:38.125
They have escaped.

04:38.792 --> 04:40.500
Give the photos back to me.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.417
No way.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.125
Sorry.

04:53.125 --> 04:56.167
Anyway the reports can't be published.

04:57.125 --> 04:59.792
Can't? Why?

04:59.792 --> 05:02.000
How dare you ask me why.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.542
I have compensated the man with the photos.

05:06.292 --> 05:07.375
Old trick again.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.250
Trick?

05:08.250 --> 05:09.125
I order you

05:09.125 --> 05:11.875
not go anywhere from now on.

05:11.875 --> 05:13.667
You just sit here and work as a proofreader.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.083
Don't interview others anymore.

05:15.083 --> 05:16.167
Just for the incident?

05:17.250 --> 05:19.458
Although no credit, I did make efforts.

05:19.458 --> 05:21.000
I spelled a life to do the paparazzi tasks.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.750
Let's commend on your report.

05:22.750 --> 05:23.417
What?

05:23.958 --> 05:28.375
Star Liu suspected of sterility after marrying.

05:28.375 --> 05:30.667
She got pregnant soon after the report.

05:30.667 --> 05:32.958
She was suspected of gender reassignment surgery.

05:32.958 --> 05:33.792
Can you figure out,

05:33.792 --> 05:35.750
how much money we lose when sued?

05:35.750 --> 05:37.125
88% of your reports were false.

05:37.375 --> 05:39.750
And you even didn't write a retraction.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.875
You must be insane then. Just shut up.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.833
Do proofreading. Don't interview others.

05:48.125 --> 05:49.417
How about my position in the column section?

05:49.417 --> 05:50.208
Ah?

05:50.583 --> 05:51.708
Column section?

05:52.167 --> 05:55.875
Your performance is terrible.
How dare you?

05:56.250 --> 05:58.208
Save it. Ah!

06:27.083 --> 06:29.583
Excuse me! Qi Fei, hurry up!

06:29.958 --> 06:32.083
What do you think of the awarding ceremony?

06:33.542 --> 06:34.875
Did you hear me?

06:34.875 --> 06:36.083
What do you...

06:36.083 --> 06:37.125
do you think of today's award ceremony?

06:37.125 --> 06:38.833
What do you think?

06:38.833 --> 06:41.500
Hey, I am asking you. Do you hear me?

06:50.750 --> 06:53.958
Gao Xiang, Gao Xiang.

06:53.958 --> 06:56.083
Gao Xiang, what do you think
of today's awarding ceremony?

06:58.458 --> 06:59.750
Very harmonious.

07:07.917 --> 07:09.125
He is handsome.

07:09.875 --> 07:13.583
Ah! That is Hou Zhun. It is him.

07:45.667 --> 07:49.375
Zhunï¼Œare you tired of this?

07:54.292 --> 07:57.583
Don't.
She is the most disgusting of journalists.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.875
Hey, I say, are your deaf?

08:02.875 --> 08:03.833
Didn't you hear me?

08:03.833 --> 08:04.875
Why don't you answer me?

08:04.875 --> 08:06.125
Is there wax in your ear?

08:13.083 --> 08:14.167
It seems as if I'm destined

08:14.167 --> 08:15.875
to proofreading for life.

08:42.750 --> 08:43.582
(Korean) Zhun.

08:43.582 --> 08:45.125
(Korean) You care about only yourself.

08:47.833 --> 08:50.042
Do you know you really
are pain in the butt?

09:02.042 --> 09:06.625
I didn't see anything. I...I am blind.

09:06.875 --> 09:08.833
I say, is the grocery here?

09:09.167 --> 09:11.375
Is this a grocery?
Is it?

09:23.625 --> 09:24.667
You...you.

09:24.917 --> 09:25.750
Give it to me.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.167
What do you mean?

09:28.750 --> 09:30.042
Give the cell phone to me.

09:31.625 --> 09:34.958
Sir, I am a journalist from Women Sense.

09:35.250 --> 09:37.375
Journalist, you know.

09:38.917 --> 09:40.333
Hey, what are you doing?

09:41.458 --> 09:43.208
Hey, what are you doing?

09:46.875 --> 09:47.750
Password.

09:47.750 --> 09:48.625
Do you know this is illegal?

09:48.625 --> 09:49.208
Password?

09:49.208 --> 09:50.625
I would tell you if I was enchanted.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.625
Give it back to me! Give it back to me!

09:53.583 --> 09:55.333
Give it back to me! Give it back to me!

10:05.625 --> 10:07.625
Ah!

10:09.000 --> 10:10.542
What is the matter?

10:10.542 --> 10:11.375
You should apologize.

10:11.625 --> 10:13.167
It is you who should apologize.

10:13.167 --> 10:14.458
Apologize!

10:17.458 --> 10:18.708
Calm down.

10:18.708 --> 10:21.250
Stop! You wretch!

10:21.500 --> 10:25.083
Stop there! Stop! Let me go!

10:33.208 --> 10:35.708
Get the hell out of here!

10:37.042 --> 10:40.750
Next month, we and Hou Zhun's company

10:40.750 --> 10:43.708
will develop a strategic partnership.

10:43.708 --> 10:46.667
You ought to understand what I mean.

10:48.833 --> 10:52.292
Hey, what's the matter?
You look unhappy.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.333
Alas! You must be fired.

10:56.333 --> 10:57.292
Wait a minute.

11:01.208 --> 11:02.375
Thank you, madam.

11:02.708 --> 11:06.042
You are welcome. 20 yuan in total.

11:11.125 --> 11:15.417
Wow, I don't want it now.

11:15.417 --> 11:17.917
Paparazzi don't have the necessary dignity.

11:18.167 --> 11:18.917
It makes sense to quit.

11:18.917 --> 11:20.792
It was not easy for me to humbly persist.

11:21.208 --> 11:22.292
What do you think?

11:22.292 --> 11:24.458
To have a chance to be a novelist,
first you have to write for the column section.

11:24.458 --> 11:25.292
Don't you need that?

11:25.292 --> 11:26.083
Anyhow

11:26.083 --> 11:28.375
the job pays.

11:28.750 --> 11:30.917
And the rent is due next week.

11:30.917 --> 11:32.292
If you two guys don't want to be supportive.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.542
Don't add insult to injury.

11:33.542 --> 11:35.625
How can I feel ok with this?

11:35.625 --> 11:37.333
Ok, let's calm down first.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.250
Hey. Maybe you could apply for reinstatement.

11:44.708 --> 11:46.208
How can I do that?

11:46.208 --> 11:48.083
Alas, you should think it over.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.625
Isn't it Hou Zhun who got you fired?

11:51.167 --> 11:52.083
Just apologize to him.

11:52.083 --> 11:52.917
Trash!

11:52.917 --> 11:54.458
Even if I was homeless and starving,

11:54.458 --> 11:56.083
I would not apologize to the wretch.

11:56.083 --> 11:56.625
Never!

11:58.833 --> 12:00.375
Mr. Hou Zhun,

12:00.375 --> 12:03.042
you had a long day.
This is a cup of coffee for you.

12:12.792 --> 12:13.625
No.

12:14.542 --> 12:17.667
Who knows what's inside this weird stuff?

12:19.917 --> 12:23.125
How can there be?
I intended to apologize.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.042
Begin. You can begin to apologize.

12:36.875 --> 12:38.583
Well, well, well...

12:38.583 --> 12:40.542
I am sorry that

12:40.833 --> 12:42.500
I offended you that day.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.417
Stand straight.

12:50.500 --> 12:54.542
I think...
there was a misunderstanding between us.

12:54.792 --> 12:56.083
Would you please forgive me?

12:56.375 --> 12:59.292
Old Chinese saying:
Better to make friends than enemies.

12:59.292 --> 13:01.125
You always say something I don't understand.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.292
I mean... if you can cease your resentment,

13:06.292 --> 13:08.167
in your heart,

13:08.417 --> 13:10.542
Maybe we can have better communication.

13:10.542 --> 13:11.042
It is helpful.

13:11.042 --> 13:12.708
Please fold your palms first.

13:18.292 --> 13:25.458
Mr. Hou Zhun, Brother Hou Zhun, I am sorry.

13:25.458 --> 13:28.250
I have troubled and offended you.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.083
I do apologize.

13:37.125 --> 13:39.500
Ok, I accept that.

13:40.500 --> 13:45.042
Really? I get it.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.167
I don't have to resign now.

13:46.167 --> 13:47.625
I will be transferred to the column section

13:47.625 --> 13:48.833
and write novels shortly.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.167
Well, that is unlikely to happen.

13:55.708 --> 13:58.583
Apology and unemployment are different.

14:00.292 --> 14:01.542
Now you know

14:02.333 --> 14:04.792
some people you should never offend.

14:06.917 --> 14:08.500
What did you say?

14:41.667 --> 14:42.792
Now you know

14:43.500 --> 14:46.208
some people you should never offend.

15:44.833 --> 15:48.000
Let me tell you about the media age.

15:48.417 --> 15:52.000
Anti-fan, that is right. I am now your anti-fan.

15:52.292 --> 15:53.833
I will spare no effort to stigmatize you.

16:02.958 --> 16:05.667
In forums, Wechat, Microblog,

16:05.667 --> 16:07.167
let me overwhelm you with my posts.

16:12.875 --> 16:15.208
Delete my posts.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.000
How dare you delete?
Can't write them again?

16:44.375 --> 16:45.958
Who is the girl?

16:45.958 --> 16:47.292
What did she write?

16:47.833 --> 16:49.292
Is she insane?

17:08.333 --> 17:11.458
Excuse me! Who are you?

17:12.166 --> 17:13.166
Me?

17:13.166 --> 17:14.875
Come on, the director is looking for you.

17:15.125 --> 17:16.166
Come on, come on, quickly.

17:16.916 --> 17:18.375
The director is looking for you.

17:18.875 --> 17:20.041
Come on.
The director is looking for you.

17:20.041 --> 17:21.791
Don't delay. Hurry up.

17:56.625 --> 17:58.208
What is that?

18:03.042 --> 18:05.125
Who is there?

18:05.958 --> 18:08.042
Who is this guy? Stop!

18:24.542 --> 18:25.708
Hello, everyone.

18:26.125 --> 18:27.417
As a woman,

18:27.417 --> 18:30.125
You can fight with others
every now and then.

18:30.125 --> 18:32.458
That's really a rather unique state of mind.

18:32.708 --> 18:34.625
Do you really want to duke it out with him?

18:34.625 --> 18:35.833
Of course! I want to defeat him.

18:36.083 --> 18:37.750
I will have him on his knees.

18:38.333 --> 18:39.542
Bad news! Bad news!

18:39.542 --> 18:40.250
Bad,

18:40.250 --> 18:41.042
bad news!

18:41.583 --> 18:42.750
Is this your home?

18:42.750 --> 18:43.792
You came in without knocking.

18:43.792 --> 18:44.708
Watch TV, watch TV,

18:44.708 --> 18:45.417
hurry up.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.333
Have you heard of the word â€œanti-fanâ€?

18:49.583 --> 18:52.583
Korean pop star Hou Zhun and his anti-fan

18:52.583 --> 18:53.958
have become a popular topic.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.375
Efforts to hurt the pop star,

18:56.375 --> 18:57.625
by one that dislikes him,
using all possible means.

18:57.625 --> 19:00.000
This behavior and those of his fans' are very different.

19:00.250 --> 19:03.167
And so also becomes a hot topic.

19:03.750 --> 19:04.792
Don't beat me.

19:05.542 --> 19:08.500
I am the broker of Hou Zhun.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.167
Please listen to me first.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.292
Please listen to me.

19:12.292 --> 19:13.750
The public has placed great attention on

19:13.750 --> 19:15.292
Mr. Hou Zhun's anti-fan.

19:15.292 --> 19:16.625
What do you want to say?

19:17.708 --> 19:20.625
The anti-fan alsoâ€¦â€¦also focuses on me.

19:20.917 --> 19:23.333
I think she ought to be tolerated.

19:23.333 --> 19:26.792
I also have many fans opposed to one anti-fan,

19:27.167 --> 19:28.250
so I don't care.

19:41.125 --> 19:42.500
What are you doing?
Why don't you go out?

19:42.500 --> 19:43.958
Yes.

19:43.958 --> 19:45.083
Now you should dance in an

19:45.333 --> 19:46.750
extremely crazy manner.

19:47.125 --> 19:48.292
This way, you will calm down.

19:48.792 --> 19:49.625
Just entertain yourselves.

19:57.250 --> 19:59.833
What? It is odd.

20:01.875 --> 20:05.167
Miao Miao, I actually wanted to tell you .

20:05.167 --> 20:07.708
But being fired recently,

20:07.708 --> 20:09.250
I didn't think it was the right time.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.333
Have you fallen in love with me?

20:19.083 --> 20:21.875
I wanted to tell you that I'm moving in with Qi Fei.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.583
That is OK.

20:27.875 --> 20:29.792
It is so expensive to rent
houses in Shanghai.

20:29.792 --> 20:30.917
The three of us will live together.

20:31.375 --> 20:32.833
Ah, Qi Fei, we should make an agreement first.

20:32.833 --> 20:36.125
We should bathe at different times.

20:36.125 --> 20:38.333
And your bathroom time will be limited.

20:38.333 --> 20:39.042
By the way,

20:39.042 --> 20:40.833
you are not allowed to use my bath cream.

20:40.833 --> 20:41.667
Do you understand? Ok,

20:41.667 --> 20:43.042
it is agreed!

20:43.292 --> 20:45.500
Come on,

20:45.500 --> 20:46.458
let's toast.

20:46.958 --> 20:49.000
I meant the two of us would live together.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.250
Hey!

21:24.250 --> 21:25.542
<i>Hey! Hello.</i>

21:25.542 --> 21:27.167
<i>Is there Miss Miao Miao speaking?</i>

21:27.542 --> 21:28.833
Who is that?

21:29.833 --> 21:34.500
A pop star and his anti-fan living together.

21:34.500 --> 21:35.625
Living together.

21:39.750 --> 21:41.250
Shot three times per week.

21:41.250 --> 21:42.042
During the process,

21:42.333 --> 21:44.625
act as both his broker and friend.

21:44.625 --> 21:48.208
You will gradually open up to the pop star.

21:48.208 --> 21:50.250
Get to understand each other.

21:50.250 --> 21:52.667
A new concept in reality shows.

21:52.667 --> 21:56.333
You described it with great exhilaration.

21:56.917 --> 21:57.958
I won't accept that.

21:59.500 --> 22:00.917
I will attend an advertising meeting first.

22:01.167 --> 22:03.125
Then I will go directly for a planning meeting.

22:03.125 --> 22:04.792
All has been scheduled by Manager Wang.

22:04.792 --> 22:05.792
What is the ad about?

22:05.792 --> 22:07.542
Just for crisps.

22:07.542 --> 22:08.542
It is previously endorsed by Gao.

22:10.917 --> 22:12.792
It is previously endorsed by Gao Xiang.

22:13.542 --> 22:17.500
We can live without doing the ad,

22:17.750 --> 22:18.500
can't we?

22:18.500 --> 22:20.792
Better with it.

22:21.458 --> 22:22.250
Manager Wang.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.833
Now this thing with the anti-fan,

22:28.458 --> 22:29.458
if you make use of the opportunity

22:29.875 --> 22:32.458
and exhibit tolerance for the anti-fan,

22:32.875 --> 22:35.917
you will gain a better profile.

22:35.917 --> 22:39.875
And always be in the spotlight.

22:41.417 --> 22:44.083
Wait, Ms. Fang, Ms. Fang.

22:45.167 --> 22:46.250
Please.

22:46.250 --> 22:48.042
Please do me a favor by listening to me.

22:48.042 --> 22:49.917
Does this make sense?
Hou Zhun,

22:49.917 --> 22:52.417
do you know what he did to me?

22:52.417 --> 22:55.000
I have been fired and beaten by atrocious fans.

22:55.000 --> 22:55.917
I have lost my job,

22:55.917 --> 22:57.292
and my roommate.

22:57.292 --> 22:59.667
I will be homeless and out in the streets.

22:59.667 --> 23:00.750
Are you happy to learn that?

23:00.750 --> 23:01.500
It is really embarrassing

23:01.750 --> 23:03.500
to live such a life at my age.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.875
It is all Hou Zhun's fault.

23:07.542 --> 23:10.875
Actually I don't think Hou Zhun is at fault.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.125
You know nothing!

23:15.667 --> 23:20.417
Anyway, don't mention Hou Zhun in front of me.

23:20.417 --> 23:23.375
Oh the name, I get physiological reactions.

23:23.625 --> 23:24.958
I became deadly aggressive.

23:26.833 --> 23:28.750
Want to know specifics and pay?

23:31.000 --> 23:32.583
300 thousand yuan.

23:35.958 --> 23:37.542
The program will be broadcasted for four months.

23:37.792 --> 23:38.917
The broadcasting span

23:39.167 --> 23:40.458
will be extended if it gains fair popularity.

23:40.750 --> 23:43.208
I think it will be the

23:43.500 --> 23:46.167
best choice for you until you find a new job.

23:48.375 --> 23:53.083
It is your fault to have talk about money.

23:53.083 --> 23:55.167
I, Fang Miao Miao don't care about money.

23:55.167 --> 23:56.583
Of course not.

23:58.375 --> 24:00.500
Buddy, I think we should think twice .

24:00.500 --> 24:02.292
We should discuss prudently

24:02.292 --> 24:06.667
about how to lash Hou Zhun.

24:20.583 --> 24:22.083
The organization of the program is creative,

24:22.083 --> 24:24.417
because its essence is reality.

24:24.417 --> 24:25.875
For the show,

24:25.875 --> 24:28.958
he will be in charge of the show,
and I, the reality.

24:28.958 --> 24:30.000
No no no no,

24:30.250 --> 24:32.917
I will probably act differently .

24:33.167 --> 24:36.625
I don't think I will laugh and monkey about

24:37.083 --> 24:39.250
Ah, Iâ€¦â€¦who I talked about was Hou Zhun.

24:39.250 --> 24:41.542
You pretend to love and forgive him.

24:41.542 --> 24:43.750
Go ahead, haha.

24:44.458 --> 24:46.042
I am sorry I am too honest

24:46.042 --> 24:47.083
to pretend.

24:47.458 --> 24:48.917
Hopefully the audience

24:49.167 --> 24:52.333
will learn about our true personalities,

24:52.708 --> 24:54.542
even if just a little,

24:54.542 --> 24:58.250
through my stay with Hou Zhun.

24:58.708 --> 24:59.625
CUT.

25:00.042 --> 25:03.208
Perfect, very natural.

25:03.208 --> 25:04.833
You have all the qualities of a journalist.

25:05.542 --> 25:07.083
Are you in a good mood today?

25:07.083 --> 25:08.167
I feel as usual.

25:08.167 --> 25:08.833
Let's go.

25:11.042 --> 25:13.625
Please put them down gently.

25:14.083 --> 25:15.875
Careful, careful.

25:15.875 --> 25:18.917
Make sure the tripod doesn't rub the table corner.

25:19.167 --> 25:22.542
Hey, the wall, and your box. The box.

25:22.542 --> 25:24.042
You knocked the wall with the box.
Be careful.

25:24.458 --> 25:27.375
Ah, why didn't you change your shoes?

25:27.375 --> 25:28.292
Are you all prepared?

25:30.208 --> 25:31.333
Hello, Mr. Director.

25:35.708 --> 25:38.125
I guess a lot of money is being spent.

25:38.417 --> 25:40.333
It was Hou Zhun who offered it to us.

25:40.333 --> 25:41.875
It is his private residence.

25:43.167 --> 25:46.125
Pop stars are wealthy as we expected.

25:46.833 --> 25:48.542
Come on, let's work efficiently.

25:48.542 --> 25:49.917
Shoot the sofa first.

25:50.250 --> 25:50.875
And then,

25:51.125 --> 25:52.250
Ms. Fang,

25:58.167 --> 25:59.375
make her up first.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.042
How about it?

26:05.208 --> 26:08.250
A small change. Is that OK?

26:20.875 --> 26:21.875
Perfect.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.375
That is a great change.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.208
I didn't expect she could be my type.

26:27.708 --> 26:29.583
What, do you want to get beaten up?

26:35.500 --> 26:36.833
Everyone get ready.

26:36.833 --> 26:37.833
Let's begin.

26:47.375 --> 26:48.625
It is rather tidy.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.375
I mean unworldly.

26:55.292 --> 26:57.458
Any human being can get it.

27:00.250 --> 27:02.208
But I don't think you can.

27:04.667 --> 27:06.000
There is an idiom in China:

27:06.000 --> 27:07.542
The more one tries to hide, more is exposed.

27:07.958 --> 27:09.667
You must have tidy up the room,

27:09.667 --> 27:12.167
in an attempt to hide the gloomy side of you.

27:13.083 --> 27:14.958
Unrestrained as I am,

27:14.958 --> 27:18.083
I can't have mysophobia.

27:18.083 --> 27:20.458
Must a normal person have mysophobia?

27:20.458 --> 27:22.167
Of course not.

27:22.417 --> 27:25.208
But you act as different people.

27:25.500 --> 27:29.292
Multiple personality.
You act in different ways.

27:29.292 --> 27:30.417
Do you think you are normal?

27:31.833 --> 27:34.250
You are no better than me.

27:35.208 --> 27:36.625
Have you ever broken the law?

27:37.042 --> 27:39.583
My guess is that you have been arrested.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.083
What do you mean?

27:42.208 --> 27:44.167
You have slapped Chi Xiang twice.

27:44.583 --> 27:46.292
Both because of your temper.

27:46.542 --> 27:48.375
You ought to have been arrested.

27:49.542 --> 27:50.875
I haven't yet.

27:50.875 --> 27:52.958
But maybe in the future.

27:52.958 --> 27:53.625
Ohï¼Ÿ

27:54.042 --> 27:55.667
Maybe I will soon be

27:55.667 --> 27:56.500
arrested

27:56.500 --> 28:00.458
for murdering a renowned Korean star.

28:00.458 --> 28:02.792
It appears that I am not the one.

28:04.458 --> 28:07.792
Mental disorder caused by lack of love?

28:08.875 --> 28:10.125
Have you ever been in love with someone?

28:10.375 --> 28:12.333
Call the police. I want to kill him.

28:12.333 --> 28:13.250
I will visit you in prison.

28:13.250 --> 28:14.625
I will kill you then if everything goes well.

28:14.625 --> 28:16.375
Mind your safety, Zhun. Mind your safety.

28:16.375 --> 28:18.125
Don't touch me! Get away! I want to kill him.

28:18.125 --> 28:20.167
Don't be rude! Don't do it! Listen to me!

28:20.167 --> 28:21.375
Get away! I gonna kill him.

28:21.375 --> 28:24.583
This writes itself.

28:27.042 --> 28:29.250
Ah! What a pain!

28:29.250 --> 28:31.375
Wow, you are fragile!

28:31.375 --> 28:33.167
Miao Miao never complains about pain.

28:33.458 --> 28:35.958
No sense to compare me with her.

28:37.958 --> 28:39.833
Speaking of Miao Miao, I was thinking...

28:40.208 --> 28:43.583
In your opinion, when shall I move in?

28:45.208 --> 28:47.000
Taking Miao Miao's situation into consideration,

28:48.167 --> 28:50.833
I feel bad asking her to move.

28:51.542 --> 28:55.000
Yes. It seems that pain

28:55.292 --> 28:58.417
is merely transient happiness.

29:22.833 --> 29:23.708
Set out.

29:24.708 --> 29:25.625
What is this?

29:26.708 --> 29:27.667
Car key.

29:28.292 --> 29:29.750
You are my broker. You should drive the car.

29:30.417 --> 29:33.542
Car? What car?

29:33.958 --> 29:36.542
Are you from the past?
Don't know cars?

29:38.125 --> 29:40.750
It is a requisite for brokers to drive.

29:44.542 --> 29:45.792
Can't you drive?

29:51.708 --> 29:53.292
You are kidding.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.792
When I got my driving license,
you were nothing then.

30:24.583 --> 30:25.250
Don't laugh.

30:25.250 --> 30:30.875
Zhun, Zhun, open the door.

30:30.875 --> 30:33.167
(Korean) Damn it. Bad luck. I will get off.

30:33.167 --> 30:35.375
How to drive? How to start the car?

30:35.625 --> 30:36.875
How should we use it?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.125
Are you OK, Zhun?

30:42.125 --> 30:43.292
What are you doing?

30:43.583 --> 30:44.792
Aren't you going to get out?

30:45.083 --> 30:46.708
Incredible. Amazing.

30:46.708 --> 30:47.583
Let me help you.

30:48.708 --> 30:50.583
Oh, sorry, sorry. Are you OK?

30:52.167 --> 30:53.667
Don't laugh.

30:56.167 --> 30:58.708
Well, actually I feel guilty.

30:59.208 --> 31:00.708
Have you gotten hurt?

31:00.958 --> 31:02.167
Did you do that on purpose?

31:02.458 --> 31:03.958
You were trying to kill me, weren't you?

31:04.208 --> 31:05.792
I did not intend to do that.

31:05.792 --> 31:07.875
Anyway, you can't retaliate.

31:08.167 --> 31:09.292
I really had enough.

31:52.208 --> 31:53.500
You were scared.

31:54.917 --> 31:56.083
It is a snap.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.500
I'm not a little girl.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.458
Why did you react in that way?

32:03.208 --> 32:05.250
Keep away from me, OK?

32:05.250 --> 32:08.667
Well, I know I frightened you. Sorry.

32:08.667 --> 32:10.417
I said I was not sacred.

32:10.708 --> 32:12.833
Wow, wow, wow, I know.

32:12.833 --> 32:13.958
Anyway I made my apology.

32:13.958 --> 32:15.958
It's up to you to accept it or not.

32:16.792 --> 32:18.250
Except the apology,

32:19.792 --> 32:21.375
you had better not expect more.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.208
What do you think I am expecting?

32:25.083 --> 32:29.208
I would say that we are now working

32:30.250 --> 32:31.792
as commercial partners.

32:34.125 --> 32:35.833
Who do you mean?

32:35.833 --> 32:38.333
It's the scenes people expect.

32:39.250 --> 32:41.208
An awkward, inexperienced broker

32:41.667 --> 32:46.250
who makes mistakes and quarrels with me.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.333
So

32:54.208 --> 32:55.417
you act well

32:56.708 --> 32:58.125
and more professionally than me.

33:00.625 --> 33:02.333
You mean I was pretentious.

33:02.792 --> 33:04.833
You are an insidious guy. Damn.

33:06.750 --> 33:08.208
I will reckon with you.

33:09.042 --> 33:10.542
I have apologized to you.

33:10.542 --> 33:12.708
You are reaching out for
a yard after taking an inch.

33:15.792 --> 33:17.417
I didn't know you are leading the ad.

33:18.833 --> 33:20.417
Is it your hobby to deprive

33:20.417 --> 33:21.875
others of their jobs?

33:28.292 --> 33:29.958
You are not the only one

33:30.875 --> 33:32.208
in the world who can do that.

33:36.583 --> 33:41.333
Is she the new partner?
Much-anticipated.

34:07.583 --> 34:11.208
Miao Miao, Miao Miao, Miao Miao!

34:13.250 --> 34:14.250
What is the matter?

34:15.500 --> 34:17.708
We will be late for the script meeting.

34:18.583 --> 34:19.375
So?

34:19.375 --> 34:21.417
So, as my broker,

34:21.417 --> 34:22.417
shouldn't you urge them to

34:22.417 --> 34:25.125
put an end to the scene?

34:27.417 --> 34:29.458
Time to go.

34:29.458 --> 34:31.125
Brother, brother, don't drag me.

34:32.250 --> 34:33.625
brother, brother

34:34.125 --> 34:35.500
Hey, hey, you, come on.

34:42.625 --> 34:43.958
It is time for the script meeting.

34:47.333 --> 34:49.375
Do you want me to simply turn around and go?

34:49.375 --> 34:50.583
I can't say that.

35:07.958 --> 35:09.875
It's time to leave.

35:10.667 --> 35:13.125
Are you talking to yourself?

35:21.833 --> 35:23.958
It is time to leave!

35:23.958 --> 35:25.042
(Japanese) One more photo. Don't leave.

35:25.042 --> 35:25.833
Yes, Hou Zhun, one more photo,

35:26.083 --> 35:26.833
Please. Please, Miss. Broker.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.667
Time is up. Go home.

35:28.667 --> 35:31.417
Don't take photos. Stop. Go home immediately.

35:31.417 --> 35:32.167
I won't.

35:32.167 --> 35:33.208
Go home, quickly.

35:35.750 --> 35:38.375
All of you, stop. No sense.

35:38.375 --> 35:39.375
Go home now.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.875
That's ok. Anyway.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.333
Those fans came here from Japan.

35:49.125 --> 35:50.500
Ah, what is wrong with Zhun?

35:50.500 --> 35:51.667
So abrupt.

35:51.958 --> 35:54.792
He is rude if he simply leaves.

35:55.292 --> 35:56.500
What?

35:57.250 --> 35:59.333
That is OK. Please one by one.

36:03.875 --> 36:04.792
Hurry up!

36:27.750 --> 36:32.083
Hou Zhun, Hou Zhun, Hou Zhun,

36:32.958 --> 36:34.667
Time is up! Thanks.

36:34.667 --> 36:36.292
It's about time. Thanks.

36:40.458 --> 36:42.792
Wretch, wretch!

36:51.583 --> 36:52.708
(Korean) So pretentious.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.208
What did you say?

36:54.208 --> 36:55.500
Dare you say it in Chinese?

36:55.500 --> 36:59.625
Calm down, he said you worked hard.

36:59.958 --> 37:00.625
Really?

37:00.625 --> 37:01.375
Yes.

37:01.375 --> 37:02.250
Do you understand Korean?

37:02.542 --> 37:05.292
Certainly. I am Zhun's broker.

37:05.292 --> 37:07.042
I don't believe that. Ask him to come back.

37:07.042 --> 37:07.708
I will ask him.

37:08.917 --> 37:10.375
He has gone home to rest.

37:11.083 --> 37:12.042
Doesn't he live here?

37:12.792 --> 37:15.625
Zhun generally lives in the studio.

37:15.625 --> 37:17.042
He also has his own dormitory.

37:17.042 --> 37:19.208
This residence is normally idle.

37:19.208 --> 37:19.958
Idle?

37:20.208 --> 37:22.167
Ah, are you ok...

37:22.167 --> 37:23.375
Miao Miao, Miao Miao?

37:26.667 --> 37:28.083
Nothing, nothing.

37:28.083 --> 37:28.875
Mindâ€¦mind your hands, mind your hands!

37:29.125 --> 37:29.958
It is not painful, not, not, notâ€¦

37:41.875 --> 37:49.125
Hello, hello, hello?

38:16.000 --> 38:19.125
I knew they knew each other/

38:21.625 --> 38:23.625
Surprisingly,

38:27.875 --> 38:31.500
the silly-looking guy is able to compose music.

38:36.875 --> 38:38.417
Ai Lin turns up again.

38:46.292 --> 38:52.458
Wow, wow.

39:10.125 --> 39:14.875
Wow, this is life.

39:35.833 --> 39:39.792
A journalist, writer, an exhibitionist?

39:42.833 --> 39:44.125
I didn't expect you here.

39:44.125 --> 39:46.292
It is me who am supposed to say that.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.208
A journalist as you are,

39:50.083 --> 39:51.667
you surprised us by your articles.

39:51.667 --> 39:53.042
Who said you could read them?

39:53.042 --> 39:54.375
Did I allow you to enter my home?

39:56.042 --> 39:58.708
Ok, ok, I am going. Don't call the police.

40:00.250 --> 40:01.625
What is your novel about?

40:05.375 --> 40:06.542
You novel,

40:07.333 --> 40:08.917
I was unable to understand it.

40:09.542 --> 40:12.208
Nothing. I have only written a preface.

40:14.083 --> 40:16.917
Why did I answer your question just now?

40:16.917 --> 40:18.625
You could go if you don't want to.

40:19.917 --> 40:20.750
Actually,

40:20.750 --> 40:23.917
I want to write a novel about a desert inn.

40:44.500 --> 40:46.458
Gunner Mateo came in.

40:47.083 --> 40:50.375
Mateo? Does it happen in South America?

40:51.000 --> 40:52.083
China.

40:53.750 --> 40:55.083
Better to make it happen in Korea.

40:58.250 --> 41:00.375
Gunner Mateo came in

41:00.375 --> 41:01.458
and ordered a cup of whiskey.

41:12.583 --> 41:15.125
When the music suddenly stopped,

41:15.125 --> 41:17.792
they looked at the stage.

41:22.083 --> 41:24.958
Tango dancer Susan turns up.

41:24.958 --> 41:26.417
The man is named Mateo,

41:26.708 --> 41:30.458
but the girl is named Susan of China.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.458
Don't you want to listen to the story?

42:43.875 --> 42:45.042
That's it?

42:46.292 --> 42:48.625
I said I had only written a preface.

42:49.542 --> 42:51.083
I dream of being a writer.

42:51.417 --> 42:53.500
Er, dream.

42:54.542 --> 42:55.917
Why do you work as a journalist?

42:56.375 --> 42:57.750
To make a living.

42:58.542 --> 43:01.125
A hero may be embarrassed if he is penniless.

43:01.125 --> 43:02.875
As I am a girl from a small town,

43:02.875 --> 43:05.375
you will never understand the difficulties here.

43:05.875 --> 43:07.083
Because of a mindless word,

43:07.333 --> 43:09.500
I may get fired

43:09.500 --> 43:11.542
While you enjoy a powerful

43:11.542 --> 43:13.208
and luxurious life.

43:23.542 --> 43:24.458
I am leaving.

43:31.625 --> 43:33.833
Make preparations...

43:36.292 --> 43:38.042
And make sure your clothes are neat.

43:40.458 --> 43:41.750
I can live here.

43:43.208 --> 43:46.542
Only for today.

43:47.708 --> 43:49.417
It depends on my mood.

43:55.458 --> 43:58.125
Mr. Hou Zhun, help yourself to some water.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.792
The topic of today's program is:

44:08.042 --> 44:08.917
Miss. Fang shows Mr. Hou Zhun

44:08.917 --> 44:13.333
around Shanghai as a tour guide for a whole day.

44:13.333 --> 44:14.125
Tour guide?

44:16.333 --> 44:18.542
You good at torturing others.

44:34.042 --> 44:35.792
In front of us is the national flag of China.

44:37.750 --> 44:39.167
(Korean) You scared me!

44:39.167 --> 44:40.917
The building dates

44:40.917 --> 44:42.208
back more than a century ago.

44:46.417 --> 44:47.708
Look.

44:58.708 --> 45:00.167
Eat.

45:02.917 --> 45:03.667
No.

45:06.417 --> 45:07.083
Eat.

45:07.083 --> 45:07.750
No.

45:07.750 --> 45:08.250
Eat.

45:08.250 --> 45:08.833
Eat it.

45:14.708 --> 45:15.667
Eat one.

45:15.917 --> 45:16.417
No.

45:16.417 --> 45:17.083
Eat one.

45:17.083 --> 45:17.667
No.

45:17.667 --> 45:18.542
- Eat one.
- No.

45:18.542 --> 45:19.250
No. No. No. No.

45:19.250 --> 45:20.417
Taste it.

45:24.333 --> 45:25.792
Hey!

45:25.792 --> 45:26.708
What are you doing?

45:26.708 --> 45:29.208
How can our international star eat smelly tofu?

45:29.208 --> 45:30.250
Rub your face with the tofu.

45:32.542 --> 45:35.250
Damn your eating.
That will destroy your profile.

45:35.250 --> 45:36.333
(Korean) Sorry.

45:36.750 --> 45:39.167
Sorry, sorry.

45:59.125 --> 46:00.292
So many stage properties.

46:00.583 --> 46:02.583
Yes. They use lots of this at times.

46:02.583 --> 46:03.875
We took all of them here this time.

46:06.375 --> 46:07.875
Cute.

46:30.042 --> 46:31.750
It is disgusting

46:32.000 --> 46:35.583
for you to sleep without taking a bath.
You are smelly.

47:06.958 --> 47:08.042
What are you doing?

47:11.542 --> 47:12.542
What?

47:14.042 --> 47:15.750
Why did you open eyes suddenly?

47:15.750 --> 47:16.875
Is that temporary vitality before death?

47:17.125 --> 47:19.125
Were you expecting my death?

47:22.125 --> 47:23.417
What is this?

47:32.958 --> 47:34.750
It is so childish.
Hurry up and remove it.

47:35.042 --> 47:36.583
Oh, the stuff

47:36.583 --> 47:37.542
must be unlocked by a key.

47:37.833 --> 47:38.792
And?

47:43.000 --> 47:44.167
I can't remember.

47:44.167 --> 47:45.125
Hey!

47:52.583 --> 47:53.833
Are all of them sleeping?

47:53.833 --> 47:55.292
No one answers calls at midnight.

47:55.583 --> 47:56.833
What should we do?

47:58.958 --> 48:01.333
Alas, no.

48:01.583 --> 48:03.500
I was just teasing you.

48:03.917 --> 48:05.542
Ah! Driving me crazy!
(Korean)

48:14.375 --> 48:17.833
I have apologized to you several times.

48:18.083 --> 48:18.833
I intended to

48:18.833 --> 48:20.500
play a small prank on you.

48:20.500 --> 48:23.583
I didn't expect it to end this way.
Don't be angry.

48:23.583 --> 48:24.667
You know nothing.

48:26.542 --> 48:28.417
It is not like what you think.

48:28.417 --> 48:29.833
Then what is it like?

48:31.625 --> 48:33.583
I woke up because I needed to go to the bathroom.

48:38.625 --> 48:41.208
Close your eyes and relax.

48:41.458 --> 48:43.792
Fancy the universe in your mind.

48:44.042 --> 48:46.125
The vast and beautiful universe.

48:46.375 --> 48:47.583
In fact we are

48:47.583 --> 48:51.083
mere a tiny thing in the universe.

48:52.708 --> 48:53.708
Shut up.

48:54.167 --> 48:55.750
Hey, what are you doing?

48:55.750 --> 48:57.833
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

48:59.042 --> 49:00.708
Calm down.

49:00.708 --> 49:02.292
Hey, Hou Zhun.

49:02.542 --> 49:06.292
Calm down, hey.

49:14.833 --> 49:16.792
Ah, are you insane?

49:18.083 --> 49:19.083
Close your eyes.

49:22.917 --> 49:24.875
Yoâ€¦ Don't splash it on me.

49:24.875 --> 49:26.083
Do you hear that?

49:26.500 --> 49:28.833
Ah, you'll get me stained.

49:28.833 --> 49:30.292
Hey, wretch,

49:30.542 --> 49:31.958
your splash it on me.

49:32.542 --> 49:35.333
Ah, you'll get me stained.

50:19.792 --> 50:21.750
Let's call the police. Dial 110.

50:22.958 --> 50:23.958
You are crazy.

50:29.458 --> 50:31.333
Or we can turn to a locksmith.

50:32.583 --> 50:33.458
No.

50:46.583 --> 50:49.917
It is daybreak now.
What should we do?

50:53.333 --> 50:54.458
Let's go.

51:47.625 --> 51:48.875
Thank you.

51:53.958 --> 51:54.792
This week

51:54.792 --> 51:57.500
we have some adjustments fro filming.

51:57.500 --> 51:58.458
What adjustment?

51:59.000 --> 52:00.208
Our shooting schedule

52:00.208 --> 52:03.417
conflicts with Mr. Hou Zhun's schedule in Korea.

52:03.750 --> 52:05.083
So I can take off.

52:05.083 --> 52:05.833
No, you can't.

52:06.417 --> 52:09.958
But you take a trip to Korea.

52:09.958 --> 52:11.250
So I can take off.

52:17.083 --> 52:19.417
Korea, great.

52:51.458 --> 52:54.375
Wow, it is warm.

52:54.625 --> 52:56.250
<i>Slippers with dolls on them.</i>

53:00.292 --> 53:04.042
Ah!

53:10.667 --> 53:14.958
Hot, hot, hotâ€¦Very hot, hot, hot.

53:24.958 --> 53:26.500
Can I go shopping in the duty-free stores?

53:26.500 --> 53:27.750
No, you have to go to Mingdong.

53:27.750 --> 53:29.917
Exo's poster is available in the flagship store.

53:29.917 --> 53:32.500
It is troublesome. You are annoying. Got it.

53:57.250 --> 53:58.458
Ai Lin.

54:31.500 --> 54:32.583
After all this time,

54:34.833 --> 54:37.792
you're still fond of taking photos secretly?

54:48.750 --> 54:49.958
Please delete them on your own.

54:52.667 --> 54:53.625
Oh!

54:55.083 --> 54:57.583
And it makes no sense for you to follow me.

54:58.125 --> 54:59.167
Most importantly,

54:59.500 --> 55:03.958
You will get nothing.
Her and I are over.

55:26.583 --> 55:28.167
We will be late if it stays like this.

55:29.500 --> 55:30.333
What is the matter?

55:31.500 --> 55:33.375
It's an interview for Zhun.

55:33.375 --> 55:35.250
We should have set out earlier!

55:35.792 --> 55:37.708
Sorry, it was my fault.

55:38.125 --> 55:40.292
Why did you throw yourself into a fury?

55:40.292 --> 55:42.417
Mr. Miao Miao, that is OK, OK.

56:10.792 --> 56:12.375
Where are the deliveries?
(In Korean)

56:14.375 --> 56:18.000
Yang Jea Dong first then Su Seo Dong.

56:50.500 --> 56:53.583
Anything interesting about shooting?
(In Korean)

56:55.417 --> 56:58.292
Scenes of my fighting my fellow actors.

56:58.292 --> 57:01.125
<i>Mainly because it's my first time
with action scenes.</i>

57:01.125 --> 57:03.375
<i>It was kind of embarrassing.</i>

57:03.375 --> 57:04.417
Have you caught up with them?

57:05.000 --> 57:06.083
No problem.

57:07.833 --> 57:09.167
You have a long day.
(In Korean)

57:09.167 --> 57:11.583
Thank you for sparing some time.

57:13.208 --> 57:18.083
Your partner in the Chinese program.

57:19.333 --> 57:20.333
Nice to meet you.

57:20.875 --> 57:22.542
Nice to meet you.
(In Korean)

57:23.250 --> 57:25.208
What do you think of Zhun?

57:29.417 --> 57:30.875
Kind of professional.

57:30.875 --> 57:32.167
He is more talented

57:32.167 --> 57:33.542
than I imagined.

57:34.042 --> 57:35.417
A promising talent.

58:17.708 --> 58:19.208
Quite amazing.

58:22.583 --> 58:23.625
What is that?

58:25.083 --> 58:26.625
When they asked about me,

58:27.292 --> 58:28.750
I was worried that you
might say something bad.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.167
You meant that...

58:31.417 --> 58:35.167
Well, one should be flexible to survive.

58:35.167 --> 58:36.750
I live in your house now.

58:36.750 --> 58:38.208
Those accolades

58:38.208 --> 58:39.292
serve as rent.

58:48.292 --> 58:49.583
Offer me a bottle of wine, please.

58:49.833 --> 58:51.792
No, no, no, two bottles.

59:03.083 --> 59:05.083
Have you expected the public's reaction?

59:08.917 --> 59:10.375
Would you please answer the questions?

59:46.792 --> 59:48.500
I don't know if it was
the resentment that worked.

59:48.500 --> 59:49.792
Is the audience rating good?

59:50.833 --> 59:54.417
Not a problem until the end
of the second season.

59:54.417 --> 59:57.417
Is the ambience good in the Korean part?

59:57.417 --> 59:58.458
Yes, yes.

59:59.083 --> 01:00:01.958
Are you crying, Miao Miao?

01:00:07.542 --> 01:00:09.792
You're kidding.

01:00:09.792 --> 01:00:12.917
I am Fang Miao Miao.

01:00:14.417 --> 01:00:15.333
Yes.

01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:17.333
I am glad you are ok.

01:00:24.792 --> 01:00:26.292
Can you not be so
frightening when crying?

01:00:35.125 --> 01:00:36.458
Why are you here?

01:00:40.458 --> 01:00:41.958
Hey, what are you doing?

01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:43.292
What are you doing?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.250
I won't hurt you.

01:00:47.583 --> 01:00:48.500
Thanks.

01:00:49.167 --> 01:00:50.375
How do you feel?

01:00:50.917 --> 01:00:52.000
About what?

01:00:53.375 --> 01:00:54.833
Being a popular public figure.

01:00:55.708 --> 01:00:59.417
Are you satirizing or caring for me?

01:01:00.583 --> 01:01:02.208
It depends on you.

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:04.292
It is not so satisfactory.

01:01:06.167 --> 01:01:07.625
I agree.

01:01:08.667 --> 01:01:10.125
It is terrible to be famous.

01:01:12.958 --> 01:01:14.125
Bottoms up.

01:01:14.792 --> 01:01:15.750
Wine.

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:21.042
<i>She didn't answer her phone.</i>

01:01:21.042 --> 01:01:22.167
<i>Oh, here she comes.</i>

01:01:23.208 --> 01:01:25.417
Alas, why didn't you pick up the phone?

01:01:25.708 --> 01:01:27.458
Thank goodness you are alive.

01:01:27.458 --> 01:01:31.750
Yes, I saw the news.
You are awesome.

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:34.583
Do you envy me?
I have risen to fame.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.750
Will you do the program again?

01:01:37.333 --> 01:01:39.750
It is amazing you didn't do
anything evil while staying

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:41.833
with slick man Hou Zhun.

01:01:41.833 --> 01:01:43.083
What do you mean by slick?

01:01:49.458 --> 01:01:51.208
Mei Zi is my roommate,

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:52.875
and Qi Fei is my colleague.

01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:55.500
I invited them to join a club.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.667
And they fell in love with each other.

01:01:57.667 --> 01:01:59.708
Fate is marvelous, isn't it?

01:02:01.042 --> 01:02:02.667
Don't you regard the
roommate that betrayed you

01:02:03.875 --> 01:02:05.333
as an enemy?

01:02:06.375 --> 01:02:07.833
Not at all.

01:02:08.417 --> 01:02:10.833
You have a rigid outlook.

01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:13.042
It's unexpectedly good to see

01:02:13.042 --> 01:02:14.917
two of my best friends make a match.

01:02:16.542 --> 01:02:21.292
I didn't know that you were so kind.

01:02:21.292 --> 01:02:22.708
Ok.

01:02:23.042 --> 01:02:24.000
Silly.

01:02:25.792 --> 01:02:28.875
Ok, ladies and folks.

01:02:28.875 --> 01:02:30.292
Then let's invite

01:02:30.292 --> 01:02:32.167
the star of future, to take the stage!

01:02:32.167 --> 01:02:35.167
Miao Miao!

01:02:35.667 --> 01:02:37.583
Old trick!

01:02:37.583 --> 01:02:39.500
I haven't danced for a long time.
I can't.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.708
Calm down.

01:02:40.708 --> 01:02:42.375
Just dance for fun.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.792
Miao Miao, Miao Miao.

01:02:45.792 --> 01:02:51.125
Miao Miao, Miao Miao, Miao Miao.

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:14.417
It is my mother.

01:04:14.667 --> 01:04:15.542
Er?

01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:19.625
The prototype of the
leading role is my mother.

01:04:20.417 --> 01:04:21.583
My mother

01:04:22.083 --> 01:04:24.292
was a dancer in our small town.

01:04:24.542 --> 01:04:25.542
And my father...

01:04:25.542 --> 01:04:26.833
Is he really a gunner?

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:30.875
My father is a worker.

01:04:31.458 --> 01:04:34.042
My mother performed
in my father's factory

01:04:34.042 --> 01:04:35.417
And he was soon

01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:37.750
fascinated by her dancing.

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:38.833
From then on,
he made use of all kinds of opportunities

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:41.792
to watch my mother dance.

01:04:41.792 --> 01:04:44.667
He also waited for my mother.

01:04:44.667 --> 01:04:46.708
It seems that

01:04:46.708 --> 01:04:47.958
my father did make it big.

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:53.042
Compared with your weird western novel,

01:04:53.625 --> 01:04:56.625
this story is more moving and real.

01:04:57.208 --> 01:04:58.750
You know nothing.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.583
A terrific story

01:05:00.583 --> 01:05:03.542
adds to the attraction of its profound moral.

01:05:03.542 --> 01:05:04.833
Just like you.

01:05:04.833 --> 01:05:06.583
You are high-profile star

01:05:06.583 --> 01:05:08.833
only when splendidly decorated.

01:05:11.333 --> 01:05:12.958
Unnecessary to be a star.

01:05:22.417 --> 01:05:26.375
You take all your good luck for granted.

01:05:26.958 --> 01:05:28.750
You have many enjoyment in life.

01:05:30.333 --> 01:05:31.708
Take myself for example.

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:35.375
I came to Shanghai alone after college.

01:05:35.375 --> 01:05:37.083
I strived

01:05:37.083 --> 01:05:39.667
to be more outstanding.

01:05:40.375 --> 01:05:42.958
But I made little progress

01:05:43.583 --> 01:05:45.208
despite a lot of effort.

01:05:50.333 --> 01:05:51.542
It is strange

01:05:51.542 --> 01:05:52.833
that I've told you so much.

01:05:52.833 --> 01:05:53.917
Merciless as you are,

01:05:53.917 --> 01:05:55.292
you won't understand mankind's sentiments.

01:06:00.667 --> 01:06:05.083
I used to live in a village

01:06:05.083 --> 01:06:06.542
which could only be illuminated by moonlight

01:06:06.875 --> 01:06:09.042
rather than street lamps.

01:06:09.542 --> 01:06:13.167
At seventeen,
I worked as a probationer in Seoul.

01:06:14.625 --> 01:06:16.542
Even the time for me to sleep was precious.

01:06:17.542 --> 01:06:18.750
Is it possible?

01:06:20.125 --> 01:06:21.500
In my eyes,

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.042
you were born with
a silver spoon in your mouth.

01:06:24.292 --> 01:06:26.125
Have you suffered?

01:06:26.875 --> 01:06:31.208
Did you learn to play piano at that time?

01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:33.292
You play quite well,

01:06:33.917 --> 01:06:35.708
which surprised me somewhat.

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.667
I am kind of a musician.

01:06:37.917 --> 01:06:39.333
Yes.

01:06:41.333 --> 01:06:47.500
I have seen the music score,
composed by Ai Lin.

01:06:50.583 --> 01:06:54.333
Alas, I wouldn't mention if
not for what I've seen.

01:06:54.333 --> 01:06:56.958
But I've seen you and her several times.

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:59.667
I saw you once in the bar.

01:06:59.667 --> 01:07:01.458
And I also saw you in Seoul.

01:07:01.458 --> 01:07:03.667
I really have seen you several times.

01:07:06.792 --> 01:07:08.333
We were all probationers,

01:07:09.375 --> 01:07:12.625
including Ai Lin and Gao Xiang.

01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:17.292
When we were about to form a team,

01:07:18.542 --> 01:07:20.083
I happened to

01:07:20.667 --> 01:07:22.792
act in a TV series in a supporting role,

01:07:24.333 --> 01:07:26.542
and drew attention from the public.

01:07:28.042 --> 01:07:32.083
Later Manager Wang canceled the plan

01:07:33.208 --> 01:07:34.917
and featured me alone.

01:07:36.958 --> 01:07:39.875
Well, how about Ai Lin?

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:45.833
I used to love her,

01:07:47.667 --> 01:07:50.000
but Gao Xiang took her away.

01:07:50.625 --> 01:07:53.250
And Ai Lin didn't prefer me.

01:07:54.917 --> 01:07:57.250
As you do with your roommate,

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.000
I give my blessing to them.

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:02.625
I don't understand.

01:08:02.625 --> 01:08:04.250
If she didn't prefer you,

01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:06.042
why does she keep trying to meet you?

01:08:07.292 --> 01:08:11.167
Men are naturally tolerant to his first girl.

01:08:12.792 --> 01:08:16.917
No sense. You won't understand.

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:53.875
Tango is stimulating.

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:16.207
<i>Ten,</i>

01:09:17.542 --> 01:09:18.332
<i>Fifteen.</i>

01:09:18.917 --> 01:09:19.750
<i>Fifteen.</i>

01:09:24.042 --> 01:09:24.832
<i>Come, come, come.</i>

01:09:25.917 --> 01:09:26.792
<i>Fifteen,</i>

01:09:27.375 --> 01:09:28.000
<i>Ten,</i>

01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:38.167
<i>Men are naturally tolerant to his first girl.</i>

01:09:41.332 --> 01:09:44.207
What am I doing?

01:09:55.542 --> 01:09:56.708
- Brother.
- Er?

01:09:57.958 --> 01:09:59.417
Was Miao Miao

01:10:00.417 --> 01:10:02.542
fired because of me?

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.708
I think so.

01:10:04.708 --> 01:10:06.167
Her company

01:10:06.167 --> 01:10:07.500
is a strategic partner of our company.

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:09.625
They are inevitably

01:10:09.625 --> 01:10:10.583
upset about your situation.

01:10:11.333 --> 01:10:12.333
Oh, are you OK?

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:13.667
Why do you care for her?

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:15.500
Nothing.

01:10:15.958 --> 01:10:17.875
She is pitiful.

01:10:18.167 --> 01:10:19.625
She looks poor.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.583
I've met her.

01:10:22.292 --> 01:10:23.292
Oh, yes,

01:10:23.625 --> 01:10:26.625
a brand name costume launch party next week.

01:10:26.625 --> 01:10:29.000
The booklet is there for you to read.

01:10:47.542 --> 01:10:48.625
Welcome.

01:10:50.917 --> 01:10:52.208
Why did you bring me here?

01:10:52.833 --> 01:10:53.792
Didn't you know?

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:56.417
Mr. Zhun made the arrangement.

01:10:58.208 --> 01:10:59.417
It seems that

01:10:59.417 --> 01:11:02.292
Ms. Miao Miao is not invited to today's party.

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:10.958
Do you get what I wanted prepared?

01:11:10.958 --> 01:11:12.625
Yes. It is in the car.

01:11:12.625 --> 01:11:14.500
It is a new best seller this year.

01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:18.875
Ms. Miao Miao is coming.

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:45.583
She looks quite different.

01:11:53.708 --> 01:11:56.583
It is for you.

01:11:56.833 --> 01:11:59.417
For me? Really?

01:12:00.667 --> 01:12:02.792
You're going to be accompanying me in a bit.

01:12:03.333 --> 01:12:04.917
I don't want to lose face because of you.

01:12:07.958 --> 01:12:09.208
I know.

01:13:12.458 --> 01:13:13.333
Mr. Hou Zhun,

01:13:13.333 --> 01:13:14.208
would you please

01:13:14.208 --> 01:13:15.958
introduce the pretty lady to us?

01:13:16.875 --> 01:13:19.500
Don't you recognize her?
She is my anti-fan.

01:13:20.875 --> 01:13:22.167
Journalist Miao Miao.

01:13:22.542 --> 01:13:23.625
Hello, everyone.

01:13:29.542 --> 01:13:30.458
It was embarrassing.

01:13:30.458 --> 01:13:32.750
I was stunned. I couldn't laugh.

01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:33.667
What was wrong with you?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.667
The courage of beating Brother Chi Xiang?

01:13:36.667 --> 01:13:38.958
Am I Miss Thirteen of Hongxing?

01:13:38.958 --> 01:13:40.917
I don't beat everyone.

01:13:48.167 --> 01:13:49.500
Nice to see you again.

01:13:51.667 --> 01:13:54.000
You have not dated a girl for a long time.

01:13:56.875 --> 01:13:58.333
Isn't this Ms. Anti-fan?

01:14:02.917 --> 01:14:04.167
Stay with Hou Zhun for a while.

01:14:04.167 --> 01:14:06.083
She has gotten impolite.

01:14:08.833 --> 01:14:10.375
But clothes will boosted anyone's appearance

01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:14.792
Ms. Fang is pretty today.

01:14:16.375 --> 01:14:21.375
Yes. Especially the necklace.

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:49.917
Let me go.

01:14:52.208 --> 01:14:53.708
Why do you want to go all of a sudden?

01:14:54.833 --> 01:14:57.208
I know I am an

01:14:57.208 --> 01:14:59.042
appendage of pop star industrial chain.

01:14:59.458 --> 01:15:02.083
It's ok if you make use of me.

01:15:02.083 --> 01:15:04.083
But to make use of my emotions?

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:06.625
Have you signed an agreement with me

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:08.417
or given me money?

01:15:08.417 --> 01:15:10.708
You should do that with appropriate manners.

01:15:10.708 --> 01:15:12.792
What are you talking about? Don't be angry.

01:15:12.792 --> 01:15:15.417
You deal with love just like children.

01:15:15.417 --> 01:15:17.083
Can't you deal with it on your own

01:15:17.083 --> 01:15:18.708
rather than involve me in it?

01:15:24.167 --> 01:15:25.875
Please let me explain.
You misunderstand me.

01:15:25.875 --> 01:15:27.083
Let me go.

01:15:27.083 --> 01:15:28.208
Are you quarreling?

01:15:35.875 --> 01:15:37.042
You pop stars

01:15:37.667 --> 01:15:39.417
are all simple-minded.

01:15:44.833 --> 01:15:46.417
Miss Fang is funny.

01:15:48.667 --> 01:15:50.083
She is of poor taste.

01:15:50.875 --> 01:15:52.417
It is surprising you should court her.

01:15:52.417 --> 01:15:53.250
Shut up.

01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:56.000
Courting Ai Lin and Miss Fang shows that

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.583
your taste is poor too.

01:15:58.625 --> 01:16:03.125
This is the end of my tending you.

01:16:07.417 --> 01:16:09.667
What on earth?

01:16:09.667 --> 01:16:11.208
Sorry, Manager Wang. It is my fault.

01:16:11.208 --> 01:16:12.417
I am fully responsible for that.

01:16:12.417 --> 01:16:13.958
Cease all filming.

01:16:14.958 --> 01:16:17.417
Oh, but some is already scheduled.

01:16:17.417 --> 01:16:18.833
Try to put it off.

01:16:18.833 --> 01:16:20.750
I understand. I will do that right now.

01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:21.875
Yes.

01:16:50.583 --> 01:16:53.458
<i>Magazine office. Chief Editor.</i>

01:16:53.458 --> 01:16:54.917
Welcome back.

01:16:54.917 --> 01:16:56.583
What should I call you?

01:16:56.583 --> 01:16:59.458
Miao Miao,
the new director of the column section.

01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:02.333
Anyway, congratulations for

01:17:02.333 --> 01:17:04.208
your glorious return and promotion.

01:17:04.208 --> 01:17:07.917
Oh, yes, Hou Zhun's broker company

01:17:07.917 --> 01:17:10.042
temporarily ceased his cooperation.

01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:14.917
Actually we have appointed you as the new director

01:17:14.917 --> 01:17:19.542
based on our new partner's suggestion.

01:17:19.542 --> 01:17:20.500
I would like to tell you that

01:17:20.792 --> 01:17:23.458
he is actually a very handsome guy.

01:17:24.125 --> 01:17:26.333
Here, this is him.

01:17:32.333 --> 01:17:33.583
Didn't you declare to disclose

01:17:33.583 --> 01:17:35.667
the gloomy side of Hou Zhun's personality?

01:17:36.167 --> 01:17:38.542
As the new partner of your magazine office,

01:17:38.542 --> 01:17:40.667
I will fully support you.

01:17:41.167 --> 01:17:43.542
And with your engagement in the reality show,

01:17:43.542 --> 01:17:47.917
your reports will be more convincing.

01:17:47.917 --> 01:17:50.042
Isn't it a godsend?

01:17:57.167 --> 01:18:02.667
Hey. Now? Ok.

01:18:05.708 --> 01:18:07.417
Sorry, I have to take care of some businesses.

01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:19.083
Does she think she really is famous?

01:18:19.542 --> 01:18:21.583
She is so complacent.

01:18:23.875 --> 01:18:24.958
I've forgotten about last night.

01:18:25.708 --> 01:18:26.833
You know,

01:18:26.833 --> 01:18:29.583
I tend to forget all the enmity overnight.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:36.042
It was me who bought the necklace.

01:18:36.833 --> 01:18:39.417
Zhun asked me to buy a necklace.

01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:41.708
Broker Chi Xiang.

01:18:41.708 --> 01:18:43.500
I didn't expect I should meet Ai Lin there.

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:44.708
Ai Lin.

01:18:48.625 --> 01:18:52.167
I think she wore the same on purpose.

01:18:55.917 --> 01:18:56.958
Oh.

01:18:58.208 --> 01:19:00.000
In fact I talked with Zhun

01:19:00.333 --> 01:19:01.625
before I bought the necklace.

01:19:03.083 --> 01:19:05.583
I asked him if he got along well with Miao.

01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:08.958
Yes.

01:19:09.208 --> 01:19:10.083
Really?

01:19:10.708 --> 01:19:12.333
She said she strived to make a living.

01:19:21.667 --> 01:19:24.292
He knew you had been fired because of him.

01:19:24.542 --> 01:19:25.958
Actually Zhun felt guilty.

01:19:27.042 --> 01:19:29.875
But he was not the decision-maker anyway.

01:19:35.708 --> 01:19:37.500
When playing piano in the club that day,

01:19:38.417 --> 01:19:39.875
he was really handsome.

01:19:41.458 --> 01:19:42.875
Just like your father.

01:19:43.542 --> 01:19:46.542
A gentle man who plays piano.

01:19:48.375 --> 01:19:50.167
Isn't he your Mr. Right?

01:19:55.042 --> 01:20:01.375
My folks, I and you, Mei Zi

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.417
We belong to the same class.

01:20:09.792 --> 01:20:10.875
But he belongs to another.

01:20:31.875 --> 01:20:33.042
It is awesome of you

01:20:33.292 --> 01:20:34.833
to recover it such a short time.

01:20:52.167 --> 01:20:53.250
Hey!

01:20:53.583 --> 01:20:54.583
Hey, Miao Miao,

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:55.500
did you write this article?

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:56.583
What is the matter?

01:20:57.042 --> 01:20:58.208
Hurry up to see it online, be quick!

01:21:27.458 --> 01:21:29.375
Even if it's just a little,

01:21:29.375 --> 01:21:30.542
hopefully the audience will know the truth

01:21:30.542 --> 01:21:33.125
of your so-called model.

01:21:38.542 --> 01:21:40.333
Journalist Miao, is that Journalist Miao?

01:21:40.333 --> 01:21:42.458
Journalist Miao Miao, Journalist Miao Miao.

01:21:43.292 --> 01:21:44.167
When you agreed to be in the program,

01:21:44.167 --> 01:21:45.167
was it to write this article?

01:21:46.958 --> 01:21:48.750
What is the motivation behind it?

01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:50.500
Is the article true?

01:21:59.208 --> 01:22:00.125
From the beginning,

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.500
Couldn't you figure out
this crazy woman's motive?

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:11.917
Zhun, go back to Korea and stay there.

01:22:11.917 --> 01:22:17.000
Why? Did I make a mistake?

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.083
What do you think?

01:22:19.875 --> 01:22:23.333
The report is true.

01:22:24.667 --> 01:22:27.083
What are you worried about,

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:31.542
me or the profile of the company?

01:22:31.542 --> 01:22:35.042
Are you powerful enough to be so complacent?

01:22:35.042 --> 01:22:36.125
Get out!

01:22:37.167 --> 01:22:38.167
Quickly!

01:22:45.958 --> 01:22:47.833
Oh, it is Miao Miao.

01:22:48.542 --> 01:22:51.417
You finally write a stimulating article.

01:22:51.417 --> 01:22:53.833
Sit. I will treat you to supper to celebrate.

01:22:55.375 --> 01:22:57.000
You read the stuff in my computer.

01:22:57.667 --> 01:22:59.250
And you restored what I had deleted.

01:23:00.167 --> 01:23:01.792
You were stealing.

01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:04.333
You go too far to describe that as stealing.

01:23:04.333 --> 01:23:05.250
You wanted to publish it

01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:07.125
when you first wrote it.

01:23:07.417 --> 01:23:08.250
Didn't you?

01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:10.000
You hoped others would discuss it,

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.542
and view you as a victim.

01:23:11.833 --> 01:23:13.125
You are damned despicable.

01:23:16.292 --> 01:23:17.500
Pretend to be a victim?

01:23:19.167 --> 01:23:20.667
I am a real victim.

01:23:21.583 --> 01:23:23.875
It was true that Zhun betrayed me and Ai Lin

01:23:24.542 --> 01:23:25.833
to make his debut.

01:23:27.167 --> 01:23:28.542
Why are you hostile towards me?

01:23:30.167 --> 01:23:32.667
We ought to be partners, oughtn't we?

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:41.125
Do you know why I was fired by the company?

01:23:41.375 --> 01:23:42.125
Er?

01:23:43.458 --> 01:23:44.708
Miao Miao.

01:23:44.708 --> 01:23:48.000
You are despicable. A despicable villain.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:48.917
Calm down.

01:23:49.583 --> 01:23:50.750
I have to say,

01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:52.500
retract the article right now.

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.167
If you don't,

01:23:53.167 --> 01:23:55.500
I will burn the damned magazine office.

01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:57.500
Calm down.

01:23:58.208 --> 01:23:59.375
Let me go.

01:24:09.208 --> 01:24:11.125
Zhun, Zhun.

01:24:28.042 --> 01:24:29.125
Start the car.

01:25:15.875 --> 01:25:17.750
What do you mean?
Are you leaving?

01:25:18.417 --> 01:25:21.083
Don't do that.

01:25:21.083 --> 01:25:23.417
You still have us, even if you are unemployed.

01:25:23.417 --> 01:25:26.958
Alas, what she needs now is not us at all.

01:25:26.958 --> 01:25:29.250
She doesn't need us.
Does she need justice ?

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:32.792
It is Hou Zhun.

01:25:34.458 --> 01:25:36.417
Justice has been destroyed.

01:25:36.417 --> 01:25:38.708
I don't have to make calmly any more.

01:25:39.417 --> 01:25:41.250
You can explain to him.

01:25:42.417 --> 01:25:43.792
Can you stand the insult

01:25:44.042 --> 01:25:45.792
on your character?

01:26:06.542 --> 01:26:08.000
You are still sleeping.

01:26:20.083 --> 01:26:22.833
Are you surprised to find me here?

01:26:24.375 --> 01:26:29.083
Don't you know about Zhun and me?

01:26:29.792 --> 01:26:31.417
Is it natural to be surprised?

01:26:32.583 --> 01:26:36.125
Sorry, I have to go.

01:26:52.167 --> 01:26:58.500
I intended to make a formal apology to you.

01:26:59.625 --> 01:27:00.833
I am sorry.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.792
Get up. You have to eat.

01:27:12.292 --> 01:27:15.125
You caught a headache this morning?

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.167
What do you prefer for breakfast?

01:27:17.792 --> 01:27:20.750
Something light may be better.

01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:21.833
Why are you here?

01:27:22.625 --> 01:27:26.875
Is it not more appropiate for me
to be here than her?

01:27:29.875 --> 01:27:30.667
Get out.

01:27:33.292 --> 01:27:33.958
Zhun!

01:27:33.958 --> 01:27:35.125
Get out!

01:27:50.875 --> 01:27:54.500
As a journalist, it is largely my fault.

01:27:55.333 --> 01:27:58.458
I get used to writing articles
based on my own mood.

01:27:58.458 --> 01:28:02.167
My reports were based on
imagination instead of facts.

01:28:02.167 --> 01:28:05.750
I tended to write articles
in an exaggerated way.

01:28:06.542 --> 01:28:10.833
As a journalist, I admit that I was a failure.

01:28:11.792 --> 01:28:15.042
And for my partnership with Zhun
in the reality show,

01:28:15.333 --> 01:28:18.542
I indeed had ill intentions at the beginning.

01:28:19.542 --> 01:28:24.750
But he was not like the person I had imagined.

01:28:25.792 --> 01:28:27.458
He seemed to live a more strenuous life

01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:31.417
than most other people.

01:28:32.792 --> 01:28:34.458
I am not entitled

01:28:34.458 --> 01:28:36.500
to libel him with a journalist's pen,

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:37.875
which can manipulate the public's opinion.

01:28:38.542 --> 01:28:39.958
Whether as recovery of conscience,

01:28:40.583 --> 01:28:42.583
or as payment to Hou Zhun's care

01:28:42.583 --> 01:28:44.833
during the filming,

01:28:45.375 --> 01:28:47.375
I thus delayed publishing

01:28:47.375 --> 01:28:49.250
this faulty articles.

01:28:49.917 --> 01:28:51.167
Speaking of

01:28:52.792 --> 01:28:54.500
the negative influence

01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:57.458
of the disclosure on Mr. Hou Zhun,

01:28:57.458 --> 01:28:59.000
I have to make an impartial statement.

01:28:59.917 --> 01:29:02.125
I confirm that

01:29:02.125 --> 01:29:04.833
I have fabricated the news
of the love triangle.

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:06.958
This fabrication was my way to hurt Hou Zhun.

01:29:06.958 --> 01:29:09.125
An incompetent journalist of his anti-fan.

01:29:09.708 --> 01:29:14.167
I hereby express my regret and apology.

01:29:15.625 --> 01:29:18.583
I am willing to take all legal responsibilities

01:29:18.583 --> 01:29:20.917
of the negative impact of the article.

01:29:21.167 --> 01:29:23.875
I've also decided to quit my job.

01:29:24.417 --> 01:29:26.167
That is all what I can do.

01:29:26.833 --> 01:29:29.500
My sincerest apologies.
Thank you.

01:29:31.958 --> 01:29:33.583
This is a piece of entertainment news.

01:29:33.583 --> 01:29:35.000
The scandal of the love triangle involved,

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.500
Hou Zhun and Gao Xiang 's troubles,

01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:38.458
have been proved to be a false report,

01:29:38.458 --> 01:29:41.500
from Journalist Miao Miao,
an anti-fan of Hou Zhun.

01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:43.958
And according to Women Sense,

01:29:43.958 --> 01:29:46.667
the incident had been Miao's personal action

01:29:46.667 --> 01:29:47.917
and had nothing to do with them.

01:29:49.625 --> 01:29:51.167
She is indeed out.

01:31:32.292 --> 01:31:34.208
Ok. Wish you a pleasant journey!

01:31:34.208 --> 01:31:35.083
Thanks.

01:31:38.125 --> 01:31:39.458
First class.

01:31:39.792 --> 01:31:43.458
Oh, has someone made a mistake?

01:31:43.458 --> 01:31:44.792
This is first-class cabin.

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:47.708
Yes, your seat has been upgraded.

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:50.458
Is it a sales promotion of the airline?

01:31:51.125 --> 01:31:53.000
I purchased a economic-class cabin ticket.

01:31:53.667 --> 01:31:56.667
Ah, I am sorry.

01:31:56.667 --> 01:31:59.000
Now we can't find the reason.

01:31:59.875 --> 01:32:00.833
Ah.

01:32:23.833 --> 01:32:25.167
Sorry.

01:32:26.250 --> 01:32:27.417
It doesn't matter.

01:32:39.708 --> 01:32:43.375
Why are you... you here?

01:32:44.042 --> 01:32:47.500
Don't speak to me in this way.

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:51.292
You have spoiled my scene of departure.

01:32:51.292 --> 01:32:52.833
But I am too kind to scold you.

01:32:52.833 --> 01:32:54.667
I really intend not to see you anymore.

01:32:56.958 --> 01:33:02.208
It is intention rather than will.

01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:07.542
Were you following me?

01:33:08.958 --> 01:33:14.042
I also go to Harbin to scout locations for filming.

01:33:15.292 --> 01:33:18.958
I'm going invest and make a film.

01:33:20.208 --> 01:33:21.458
It is about

01:33:22.167 --> 01:33:27.000
a village dancer and a
factory worker's love story.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.333
Without any flashy elements,

01:33:30.250 --> 01:33:35.458
the film will be simple and pure.

01:33:38.333 --> 01:33:42.500
Would you please write the script for me?

01:33:46.167 --> 01:33:47.333
No!

01:33:49.208 --> 01:33:50.167
Er.

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:56.000
I have something to tell you.

01:34:00.292 --> 01:34:02.958
Brother Chi Xiang bought the necklace.

01:34:02.958 --> 01:34:03.833
No.

01:34:07.667 --> 01:34:08.833
That day I and Ai Lin...

01:34:08.833 --> 01:34:10.208
No.

01:34:53.625 --> 01:34:56.042
So we make a deal for the script.

01:34:56.042 --> 01:34:58.667
You are not my boss,
let me see the agreement first.

01:34:59.042 --> 01:35:00.667
Do you want to earn money from me?

01:35:00.667 --> 01:35:04.750
Even reckoning makes long friends.
Understand?

01:35:11.125 --> 01:35:19.458
Hou Zhun, Hou Zhun, Hou Zhun

01:35:57.375 --> 01:35:58.333
Hello.

01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:12.417
We only tailor make one ring per customer.

01:36:12.417 --> 01:36:14.583
Means his is a true lifetime love.
