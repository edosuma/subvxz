01:58.619 --> 01:59.995
I get it. I messed up.

02:01.038 --> 02:05.709
That doesn't mean that I shouldn't,
you know, at least attempt to fix it.

02:05.793 --> 02:09.503
Even though I can't go back and change
exactly how it is that I got there.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.759
I'm trying to say that I can't fail
this time.

02:15.719 --> 02:18.639
So, basically the essence of what...

02:18.722 --> 02:21.308
You know, trying to sound smart
can sometimes work in reverse.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.869
I'm not trying to sound smart, I just...

02:22.893 --> 02:25.437
Jason, I'm not gonna change your grade.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.481
Just a little? Like, temporarily.

02:27.564 --> 02:31.860
If you want to pass bio,
do what any of us do and study.

02:31.944 --> 02:32.820
Alice.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.447
I'm not gonna feel sorry
for the spoiled headmaster's kid,

02:35.530 --> 02:38.075
but if you want to try
some other computer nerd, good luck.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.830
All right, gather around.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.791
Design students, come on.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.625
Bring it in, we're gonna see some coins.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.253
Come on, guys,
please listen to Mr. Rankin.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.048
Hey, Dakota, Dylan...

02:54.299 --> 02:56.301
come be in love over here.

02:56.384 --> 03:00.388
Thank you. All right, we're gonna go in,
we're gonna use our inside voices,

03:00.472 --> 03:03.767
we're gonna be super respectful,
really jazzed about coins,

03:03.851 --> 03:07.437
and we're gonna show them
what kind of school Dennington Prep is.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.201
- Shitty one?
- Jason.

03:09.982 --> 03:11.024
All right, guys, let's go.

03:11.108 --> 03:14.236
Let's please enter the building
in a calm and orderly fashion.

03:14.319 --> 03:18.490
Are you guys excited?
Follow me. Let's not dillydally.

03:18.573 --> 03:19.908
These coins are gonna...

03:25.247 --> 03:26.581
Good behavior, Jason.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.925
You're fine.
Don't forget to take a pamphlet.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.474
Okay, guys.

03:44.557 --> 03:50.188
Mr. Garcia here is the operations manager,
but he also happens to be my cousin.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.399
So, be cool.

03:53.108 --> 03:57.905
Here at the U.S. Mint,
we are big fans of thorough design.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.489
In fact, I'm willing to bet

03:59.572 --> 04:04.161
that most of you have a few of our
best designs in your own pockets.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.913
Do you guys make credit cards?

04:05.996 --> 04:07.122
Uh...

04:07.205 --> 04:08.599
- No...
- 'Cause I only use credit cards.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.459
No.

04:10.542 --> 04:13.378
You make quarters and stuff.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.106
- Oh, my God.
- Quarters and stuff, yes.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.589
- We press...
- I'm still not changing your grade, Jason.

04:17.673 --> 04:18.675
...on an operational day.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.470
- Shall we start the tour?
- Yes.

04:22.554 --> 04:27.309
Congress passed something
called the <i>Coinage Act</i> in 1792,

04:27.392 --> 04:28.726
but I'm betting...

04:29.937 --> 04:32.605
- Hey.
- What did Jason Hodges want?

04:32.689 --> 04:33.857
Nothing.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.110
Wait, he didn't try to ask you out,
did he?

04:37.194 --> 04:39.362
Oh, my God. Shut up, Greg.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.949
No, you're right,
that would be way too weird.

04:42.032 --> 04:45.618
You're not one of those
Jason Hodges type of girls anyway.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.581
And what exactly
is a Jason Hodges type girl?

04:49.664 --> 04:51.708
You know, like, um...

04:51.792 --> 04:55.087
no makeup, effortlessly gorgeous,

04:55.170 --> 04:57.047
uh, does well at parties...

04:57.130 --> 05:00.633
You're more of a "no makeup, uh,

05:00.717 --> 05:04.304
I don't care what people think about me,
I'd rather be at home gaming"

05:04.387 --> 05:05.931
type girl.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.474
Thanks, Greg.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.184
...American State Quarters series.

05:09.267 --> 05:13.688
It's similar to that, but set in the wild
as opposed to state-by-state specific.

05:13.771 --> 05:17.943
Oh, he just asked me to change
his grade for him, and I said no.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.695
Okay, of course he asked you
to change his grade.

05:20.778 --> 05:22.447
Is that all people think we do?

05:22.530 --> 05:25.575
You know, I have a very important
computer science project due fourth period

05:25.658 --> 05:27.077
and I'm stuck on this field trip.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.880
Speaking of that, I actually have it
on my phone if you want to look.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.707
- Yeah.
- Are you serious?

05:32.790 --> 05:35.919
A federal building with a WEP-encrypted
Wi-Fi network?

05:37.045 --> 05:39.131
- That's cute.
- What a joke.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.301
The coins are then heated
in an annealing furnace

05:43.385 --> 05:47.264
in order to soften the metal
for upsetting, striking and washing.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.142
But here is where the magic begins.

05:50.225 --> 05:54.271
With highly-skilled artists
who mold and finesse the artwork

05:54.354 --> 05:59.359
which will eventually be stamped
onto each coin using one of these dies.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.485
It's that simple.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.405
Now, I've got a question for the class.

06:03.488 --> 06:07.200
Sometimes our inspectors
will catch a flaw in a finished coin.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.828
Now, when that happens,
the coin has to be scrapped.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.038
Every now and then, one of them gets out.

06:12.122 --> 06:15.125
It can be very lucrative
for coin collectors.

06:15.208 --> 06:20.755
What do you imagine would be the cause
of an error coin on a mechanical level?

06:21.590 --> 06:22.591
Go ahead, Benny.

06:23.425 --> 06:26.803
Well, if there's no metal
for the dies to stamp,

06:26.886 --> 06:28.055
wouldn't they clash together?

06:28.138 --> 06:29.139
Yes.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.933
I'd imagine the machines are strong enough

06:31.016 --> 06:32.736
so that they would
actually damage the dies,

06:32.809 --> 06:35.689
and any coins that get stamped after that
would have clash marks on them.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.981
Well done.
No one ever gets the answer right.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.417
What, are you looking for extra credit?

06:39.441 --> 06:41.502
- Stop it.
- Okay. You know what?

06:41.526 --> 06:43.736
At this moment,
I'd like to open the floor to questions.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.488
If anything I've said is confusing,

06:45.572 --> 06:47.240
or if you'd like me to expand...

06:47.324 --> 06:48.658
I think it's very...

06:51.411 --> 06:53.621
- James Hodges?
- Yes.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.308
We're going to need you
to come with us, sir.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.374
Dad?

06:56.458 --> 06:59.502
I can't leave right now,
I'm on a field trip with students.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.606
- We're not asking.
- All right, can I just...

07:01.630 --> 07:03.482
That's my son.
Can I have a word with my son, please?

07:03.506 --> 07:05.008
- What's going on?
- No.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.426
- Officer...
- No.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.321
- What's going on?
- Jason, just call Mom.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.679
- Hey, hey, hey!
- It's all right.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.074
Just call your mother, Jason.
Call Mom.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.284
Please, no phones
or video allowed in the Mint.

07:13.308 --> 07:16.228
Okay, phones down.
Eyes on Mr. Garcia. Okay.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.191
- Stop it.
- Phones down, everyone.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.471
We're gonna continue the tour.

07:20.732 --> 07:21.774
Mom. Mom, uh...

07:23.860 --> 07:25.070
Dad just got arrested.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.548
They're at school, too.
They've canceled classes and everything.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.652
- Okay... that's enough.
- I don't know.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.510
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.595
We're gonna continue the tour.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.661
Oh...

07:34.454 --> 07:36.174
You think they'll make us
go back to school?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.018
Ten million dollars.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.378
You have to understand our situation.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.547
Sarah, were you aware...

07:44.631 --> 07:47.134
your husband was embezzling
from the endowment?

07:48.176 --> 07:49.719
No, of course not.

07:49.803 --> 07:54.933
No. No, of course not.
I'm sorry, I had to ask.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.395
Okay.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.821
I'm sorry to interrupt your, um...

08:09.822 --> 08:11.741
- Kung Pao chicken.
- Yeah.

08:11.824 --> 08:15.703
But I just wanted to let you both know
that we're gonna take care of this.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.165
It's gonna be okay.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.209
We'll talk tomorrow.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.960
- Have a good night, Harold.
- Yes.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.222
He has to think about the board, Jason.

08:35.222 --> 08:36.390
He's a dick.

08:37.892 --> 08:41.520
Mr. Smerconish is trying to help us.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.940
He's been trying
to help the school for years.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.236
Just like Dad.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.655
Yeah.

08:52.407 --> 08:53.616
Just like Dad.

08:57.204 --> 09:01.374
He's not guilty.
He could never have done this.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.375
- Benny?
- Mmm-hmm?

09:43.458 --> 09:45.627
- Great.
- Thanks.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.804
Well, I like it.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.518
Nobody likes it.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.396
I guess I'm no one, then.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.273
My dad says it's a symbol.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.108
It's part of his...

10:09.484 --> 10:11.903
big plan to make
this school matter again.

10:12.904 --> 10:15.115
It's just an expensive blob of metal.

10:15.907 --> 10:19.619
Isn't it supposed to be
a fountain of knowledge?

10:20.620 --> 10:25.917
Or a wave of bright, shining futures?

10:26.501 --> 10:28.628
Isn't that what he said
at the unveiling assembly?

10:29.129 --> 10:31.631
Either way, I like it.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.843
Alice, watcha workin' on?

10:35.927 --> 10:38.763
A new commemorative coin rendering.

10:39.847 --> 10:42.058
Great. Great.

10:42.142 --> 10:47.313
Jason, project? Yes, no, maybe?

10:51.108 --> 10:52.402
All of the above.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.546
Hodges, I know it's rough dealing
with what your dad did and all,

10:56.573 --> 10:58.283
but do not blow this off.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.285
You're better than that.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.036
I asked to make this announcement today

11:02.119 --> 11:05.039
because I thought you would appreciate
hearing from a student,

11:05.623 --> 11:07.667
someone who believes
just as much as you guys do

11:07.750 --> 11:11.045
that extracurriculars and clubs
are the heart of Dennington Prep.

11:11.128 --> 11:15.425
But as president
of six after-school clubs,

11:15.508 --> 11:17.051
I am very sorry to announce

11:17.134 --> 11:20.054
that we have been forced
to suspend all student activities

11:20.138 --> 11:21.514
due to compromised funding.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.116
Clubs will be the first to go.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.267
This includes the following.

11:25.477 --> 11:31.233
Ant Farming, Architecture, Birding, Chess,
Checkers, Chinese, Chinese Checkers,

11:31.316 --> 11:34.569
Community Service, Creative Writing,
Ethics, Film Views,

11:34.652 --> 11:37.530
Gardening, Inkwell,
Math Team, Mock Trial,

11:37.614 --> 11:40.617
Queer Straight Alliance, Robotics,
Spanish Language Immersion,

11:40.700 --> 11:42.744
Stock Market Watchers, Theater,

11:42.827 --> 11:44.913
Young Democrats, and Young Republicans.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.956
So all we have are classes now?

11:47.039 --> 11:48.207
Everything is canceled,

11:48.291 --> 11:51.669
except for Yearbook, Newspaper,
and the Winter Formal.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.188
And also...

11:53.212 --> 11:54.922
Also...

11:55.923 --> 11:57.776
There will still be
some major cutbacks

11:57.800 --> 11:59.511
to those areas as well.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.220
Unfortunately...

12:02.514 --> 12:06.643
the Winter Formal will be held
in our cafeteria this year.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.770
Which is not as bad of a space.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.606
It's not actually as bad
as you think it is.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.108
Guys, it's gonna be sorted out.
We're gonna be fine.

12:14.191 --> 12:16.110
Everything will be taken care of.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.987
I'm so sorry.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.912
What are you doing in here?
You were supposed to be at the assembly.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.289
The one about how my dad
ruined the school?

12:28.373 --> 12:30.041
No, thank you.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.794
I'm looking for guitar strings.
I left some in here last week.

12:32.877 --> 12:36.130
That reminds me, we can't afford
a real band to play Formal,

12:36.213 --> 12:37.882
so we're gonna need your band to play.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.302
My band's real.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.095
Right. I just need to know
if you can do it, Jay.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.139
I don't know.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.493
Your dad is the one that got us
into this mess.

12:47.517 --> 12:48.637
Are you really gonna say no?

12:49.811 --> 12:51.562
Fine, yeah. Yeah, we'll do it.

12:51.646 --> 12:55.442
Well, is that a... a real commitment
or is that a Jason Hodges commitment?

12:56.901 --> 12:58.820
How long are you gonna
hold that over my head?

12:58.903 --> 13:00.196
It's been over a year now, okay?

13:00.279 --> 13:02.865
I get it. You're perfect.
You never made a mistake before.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.742
Dated you.

13:05.660 --> 13:08.788
Trust me, I'm everybody's mistake.
Join the club.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.749
I can't, they're all canceled.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.255
The cafeteria?
Are you kidding me?

13:18.340 --> 13:19.716
Maybe it could be lunch themed.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.399
Guys, the committee met for three hours
trying to figure this out.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.678
There's no other option.

13:24.679 --> 13:28.015
Whatever. Thanks for canceling
Chinese Checkers Club.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.101
I didn't cancel anything.
You know what?

13:30.184 --> 13:31.704
I have to check something.
I'll see you later.

13:31.728 --> 13:32.729
Oh.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.565
Hi.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.943
Hi. Good, uh, assembly.

13:39.026 --> 13:41.613
Seriously? What do you have
to complain about?

13:41.696 --> 13:43.176
It's not like they canceled football.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.116
I was just saying you did a good job

13:45.199 --> 13:47.035
with all those people
yelling and everything.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.036
Oh.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.499
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.717
- There he is.
- Hey, man.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.844
You know, we're gonna
try to sell this thing.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.513
Get our parents' money back.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.473
How does your dad like it in jail?

14:15.062 --> 14:16.689
Gimme one of those.

14:19.609 --> 14:20.902
Nice one.

14:20.985 --> 14:24.030
Jason...
we need to talk.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.032
Ooh...

14:26.115 --> 14:27.825
Screw you, Dylan.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.245
I don't need you to feel bad for me.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.665
I don't, remember?
I told you yesterday.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.583
But I want to help.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.420
I think I can help.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.172
You can't, okay?

14:41.255 --> 14:42.924
Unless you have ten million dollars.

14:44.426 --> 14:45.802
We should go somewhere to talk.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.931
So, you know I've hacked into
some places before?

14:50.432 --> 14:53.685
Uh, yeah, like grades and stuff, right?

14:54.852 --> 14:57.688
Yeah, and some other stuff too.

14:58.523 --> 14:59.524
Like what?

15:01.275 --> 15:03.861
Front office, school district...

15:05.321 --> 15:06.739
Google, IBM...

15:06.823 --> 15:08.074
TSA, NASA.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.994
- Are you serious?
- Yes, but I didn't steal anything.

15:12.078 --> 15:15.372
I just wanted to see if I could get in,
and I did.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.710
Anyway, when we were at the Mint,
I noticed a few things.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.378
Their internal security
is ridiculously outdated

15:21.463 --> 15:24.006
and anyone could get into
their corporate network with just...

15:24.090 --> 15:27.301
I'm not stealing money from anybody,
especially not the U.S. government.

15:27.384 --> 15:31.723
Okay, well, if you are
looking to save Dennington,

15:31.806 --> 15:34.892
your options are kind of limited, legally.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.605
Why do you care so much about this?

15:39.355 --> 15:41.148
I thought you hated me.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.358
I don't know.

15:43.485 --> 15:48.072
I guess I kind of know what it's like
to have parents who do shitty things.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.156
You...

15:49.824 --> 15:52.409
I saw the way people were looking at you
and talking about you

15:52.494 --> 15:54.454
just because of what they think
your dad did.

15:54.537 --> 15:57.331
I thought you might want
to prove them wrong.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.252
But I guess not.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.764
"Bertrand Academy, New Hampshire."

16:12.847 --> 16:13.931
Yeah.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.267
We spoke with the admissions director.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.936
If we send your transcripts
and your test scores this week,

16:19.020 --> 16:20.855
she said she could schedule an interview.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.775
You shouldn't have to give up
your dreams over this.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.192
My dreams?

16:25.276 --> 16:27.361
Yes, your professional aspirations, dear.

16:27.444 --> 16:29.906
Well, not that it matters much now...

16:31.032 --> 16:32.449
but, um...

16:33.660 --> 16:36.954
I got cast as the lead
in our school musical today.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.832
- Wow, that's terrific, honey.
- Oh! Lovely.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.544
Anyway, the thing about a school
like Bertrand is,

16:42.627 --> 16:45.129
they have a rigorous maths program...

16:45.212 --> 16:48.424
What about Philadelphia High School
for Performing Arts?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.842
For what?

16:49.926 --> 16:52.554
All right, come on.
Let's talk about this seriously.

16:52.637 --> 16:56.891
It's close enough to Brown that you can
even see your sister on the weekends.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.392
Yeah, you can see Steph.

16:58.475 --> 17:01.688
Stephanie said that she
would look into an internship for you

17:01.771 --> 17:03.147
through her journalism program.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.648
The <i>Herald,</i> right?

17:04.732 --> 17:07.984
<i>- Daily Herald.</i> She loved that.
- The <i>Daily Herald.</i> Great job.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.548
I cannot believe that you talked to her
before you talked to me.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.615
Well, I wanted her input.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.157
What about my input?

17:14.241 --> 17:16.035
It's my life!

17:16.117 --> 17:21.290
You can't just send me four states away
and expect my perfect sister to fix me.

17:21.373 --> 17:25.169
We never said she would fix...

17:25.252 --> 17:29.506
I'm tired of student council
and all the clubs that I run,

17:29.591 --> 17:32.343
and everything that I have to do
and be responsible for every day.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.179
- But you're so good at it, Dakota.
- Hon...

17:35.262 --> 17:38.057
this spot at Bertrand
is not gonna stay open forever.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.770
We need to think seriously about this.

17:43.646 --> 17:47.149
And I'm sure they have, um,
some kind of art...

17:47.233 --> 17:50.152
Of course they do. Of course they do.
We should get on this right away.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.424
<i>It can't fail.
It's absolutely foolproof.</i>

17:54.448 --> 17:56.468
<i>If it works the way
you think it will work.</i>

17:56.492 --> 17:57.493
<i>It works.</i>

17:57.577 --> 17:59.537
<i>They'll write us up in books.
We'll be historical.</i>

18:01.789 --> 18:04.584
Jason,
are you doing your homework?

18:04.667 --> 18:07.253
Yeah, don't worry about it.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.132
I watched twelve heist movies.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.258
In three days?

18:54.341 --> 18:56.636
That's not the point.
The point is that we can do this.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.641
What?

19:03.643 --> 19:05.102
Do you know what that is?

19:08.105 --> 19:09.523
I don't know, why?

19:09.606 --> 19:11.567
It's an alarm that
I was making for my room,

19:11.651 --> 19:14.361
but I was hoping if I handed it to you...

19:15.112 --> 19:16.322
you'd start playing with it

19:16.405 --> 19:18.449
and I could probably use it
to prove a point.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.494
Give me that.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.255
Oh...

19:34.423 --> 19:35.424
Good work, Benny.

19:36.383 --> 19:40.137
Hodges, you are not in this class.
Get out of here.

19:41.638 --> 19:42.932
We need Benny.

19:43.975 --> 19:44.975
Need me for what?

19:45.810 --> 19:47.603
How were you able to do that so fast?

19:48.187 --> 19:50.064
I work in my uncle's garage
on the weekends.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.150
Idiots set off their own car alarms
all the time.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.234
Funny.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.612
So you know how to work on machines?

19:56.696 --> 19:59.016
I'm a pretty decent mechanic,
if that's what you're asking.

20:00.741 --> 20:04.286
What would you say
to a mechanic-related job?

20:05.287 --> 20:06.998
One that can save the school?

20:11.043 --> 20:13.129
Ten million dollar car repair?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.131
I didn't say anything about cars.

20:15.798 --> 20:16.799
Sounds illegal.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.178
I mean it. Out.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.438
All of the heist movies
that I watched had a team.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.231
I don't think we can do this alone.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.361
What about Dakota Cunningham?
She's smart.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.280
No, don't even think about it.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.660
Don't even think about what?

20:45.077 --> 20:46.120
Nothing.

20:47.163 --> 20:48.456
Go away.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.499
I know what's going on here.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.335
- You do?
- And I'm shutting it down.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.922
Ms. Coyle said that we have to be
off campus by 4:15.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.734
You can't create your own club
when everyone else had to cancel theirs.

20:58.758 --> 20:59.998
It's just not fair.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.971
- Well, why don't you hear out what...
- Alice.

21:04.847 --> 21:07.725
Ms. Coyle gave you
a little bit of authority,

21:07.809 --> 21:10.812
and now you're running around school
like you're in charge of everything.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.521
We're just sitting here, studying.
Go.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.080
Do you want to help us figure out
how to steal ten million dollars?

21:18.360 --> 21:19.779
Excuse me, what?

21:20.488 --> 21:25.409
We're not stealing.
We're... making.

21:25.492 --> 21:26.577
Yeah.

21:26.660 --> 21:30.998
We're going to break into...
the Mint,

21:31.958 --> 21:33.793
print a few coins and, um...

21:33.876 --> 21:35.962
We're gonna rebuild
the school's endowment.

21:38.755 --> 21:40.216
Gah.

21:44.761 --> 21:46.222
Dakota, where are you going?

21:46.305 --> 21:49.058
I'm talking to Ms. Coyle.
I can't believe you'd do this.

21:50.601 --> 21:54.521
Listen, I'm sorry that I was
such a shitty boyfriend.

21:55.940 --> 21:59.235
I'm sorry that I got stoned
and I forgot to take you to that audition.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.361
I'm sorry for that.

22:00.444 --> 22:03.489
I'm sorry for so many things right now,
I don't even know where to begin.

22:04.656 --> 22:07.409
I'm just trying to fix it.

22:09.203 --> 22:10.287
Okay?

22:19.630 --> 22:21.132
Hey, Dakota.

22:21.215 --> 22:25.261
Will they be serving, uh, lunch
at the lunch-themed dance?

22:32.559 --> 22:34.311
- I want in.
- What?

22:34.895 --> 22:35.896
Of course you do.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.732
This is not an opportunity
to just boss us around.

22:38.815 --> 22:42.403
Okay. I'll just leave and go tell
Ms. Coyle about this whole conversation...

22:42.486 --> 22:44.113
Okay, stop talking.

22:44.613 --> 22:47.449
You want to help?
What can you do?

22:47.533 --> 22:49.118
What's your thing?

22:49.201 --> 22:52.454
Alibis, planning, covers.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.373
You know how serious I am
about organization.

22:54.456 --> 22:55.457
Yeah, I do.

22:56.417 --> 22:59.878
She used to color code
our entire dating schedule.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.297
- Mmm.
- It was horrible.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.258
Thoughtful.
It was very thoughtful.

23:05.676 --> 23:08.345
I also act, so I have access
to the theater wardrobe department,

23:08.429 --> 23:10.556
for anything that we need
as far as covers go.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.183
- You act?
- I just got cast in <i>My Fair Lady.</i>

23:13.267 --> 23:14.643
Congrats.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.437
Don't worry, it just got canceled.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.730
I wonder why.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.580
You know what?
I think this is gonna work.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.444
But there is one thing
that you have to do first.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.780
Do you know Benny from the football team?

23:30.826 --> 23:32.119
Benny, do you have a second?

23:32.995 --> 23:34.121
Yeah.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.833
I had a meeting
with the bursar's office this morning,

23:37.916 --> 23:41.712
and in light of
everything that's happened,

23:41.795 --> 23:44.632
it looks like
the D.M. Jamison athletic scholarship...

23:44.715 --> 23:47.259
is going to be discontinued.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.971
- But I was promised that money.
- I know.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.139
I kept my GPA up, I had a great season.

23:52.223 --> 23:53.866
I know the team doesn't
need me right now...

23:53.890 --> 23:56.393
No, look, Benny, Benny, Benny,
you're not the only one.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.395
When I know more, you'll know more.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.858
More what?
Reasons to kick out the poor kids?

24:05.111 --> 24:06.362
It's not about that.

24:07.821 --> 24:08.864
Hey.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.200
I needed to talk to you.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.763
Yeah, it's like the other day
where it was weird and awkward,

24:15.787 --> 24:17.248
and I yelled at you.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.541
- Did I ever apologize for that?
- No.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.834
I'm sorry.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.421
Anyway, um...

24:25.797 --> 24:28.317
I, uh, saw on your schedule
that you have practice after school,

24:28.384 --> 24:29.744
so I was just hoping to catch you.

24:29.801 --> 24:30.927
You know my schedule?

24:32.263 --> 24:36.058
Well, I wanted to speak to you
about Jason and Alice...

24:36.141 --> 24:38.811
Seriously... no thanks.

24:39.395 --> 24:40.521
Wait.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.608
You know more about machines
than anyone else in this school.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.007
You know that you're the only person
getting an A in robotics?

24:49.405 --> 24:51.448
I might've looked at your grades, too.
I'm sorry.

24:51.532 --> 24:54.576
Listen, I didn't leave my old school
to come get arrested here

24:54.660 --> 24:58.080
for some dumb illegal plan
the headmaster's kid came up with.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.500
School means too much to me.

25:01.583 --> 25:02.834
I get it.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.463
But you might not have a school to go to
if we don't do something about it.

25:10.426 --> 25:11.593
We need you.

25:16.098 --> 25:20.561
<i>♪ And you sit all alone again ♪</i>

25:22.771 --> 25:25.149
<i>♪ Well, I don't care ♪</i>

25:25.232 --> 25:30.446
<i>♪ I think I got
What everybody's lookin' for ♪</i>

25:30.529 --> 25:31.613
Sorry to interrupt.

25:33.074 --> 25:34.408
Jason...

25:36.702 --> 25:39.205
visiting hours are almost over.

25:39.788 --> 25:40.788
You can go without me.

25:42.666 --> 25:43.876
Well, it'd be another week.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.378
I know.

25:46.462 --> 25:48.422
I would, we just...
We have practice.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.180
Okay.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.103
I thought you said
you didn't like Jason Hodges.

26:02.186 --> 26:05.356
He's fine.
We're working on a project together.

26:06.607 --> 26:07.649
Okay. Whoa, hold on.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.693
So, first you cancel on
Friday night gaming,

26:09.776 --> 26:12.696
and now you're dropping out
of lunch lab for some project?

26:13.697 --> 26:17.201
It's not, like, a thing.
We just have a deadline.

26:20.246 --> 26:23.249
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah, I see what it is.

26:23.332 --> 26:24.625
What?

26:24.708 --> 26:26.168
His dad's in jail.

26:26.252 --> 26:29.004
All of a sudden he's got no friends,
so where does he turn?

26:29.087 --> 26:31.548
He turns to you for some reason.

26:31.632 --> 26:33.008
And you think it's good.

26:33.091 --> 26:36.052
You think,
"Cool, Jason Hodges is my friend now."

26:36.137 --> 26:37.138
But next thing you know,

26:37.221 --> 26:39.306
you're gonna start smoking
marijuana cigarettes

26:39.390 --> 26:41.308
and playing cowbell in his band.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.519
Greg, you are so weird. Relax.

26:43.602 --> 26:47.105
Okay, yeah, but just don't blame me
when you find out that he's using you.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.816
Okay?
To him, you're just a computer nerd.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.027
You're just someone
he can get a grade change from

26:52.110 --> 26:53.487
if he's nice enough to you.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.948
That is so mean.
Shut up.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.872
He does have dreamy eyes, though.
Yeah.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.583
I bet you just fall right into them,
don't you?

27:07.251 --> 27:09.461
You know what?
I can't do next week either, Greg.

27:09.545 --> 27:10.546
Fine.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.631
Friday night gaming
is permanently canceled.

27:12.714 --> 27:13.965
Fine.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.133
I gotta go.

27:19.805 --> 27:20.972
What, is he on to us?

27:21.557 --> 27:23.600
No, he's just an idiot.

27:25.101 --> 27:26.395
So what are we doing?

27:27.354 --> 27:28.939
Glad you changed your mind.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.649
Yeah.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.610
Okay, this is what I have so far
about error coins.

27:35.821 --> 27:36.947
Hey.

27:37.030 --> 27:39.283
Are you guys working
on your project during lunch?

27:39.867 --> 27:40.867
Yeah.

27:41.368 --> 27:44.871
Um... This is the only time
we can meet for our study group.

27:44.955 --> 27:46.415
Your study group?

27:48.292 --> 27:49.960
For art class.

27:50.461 --> 27:53.129
Well, it is the most difficult art class
in the whole school.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.674
It's the only art class
in the school, Jason.

27:55.757 --> 27:58.093
And maybe if you study,
you'll get a passing grade.

27:59.470 --> 28:01.347
- This is cool.
- Um...

28:05.559 --> 28:09.187
We have a lot to finish
before lunch is over, so...

28:12.649 --> 28:13.649
Carry on.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.950
Okay, we definitely have to find
a new place to meet.

28:22.576 --> 28:24.578
I've got a place we can go after school.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.622
It's not around here, though.

28:33.504 --> 28:37.383
So, we can come here after school,
after my uncle closes up the shop.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.762
Just, uh, make yourselves at home,
I guess.

28:48.393 --> 28:51.396
Just don't touch anything
unless I say you can. Please.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.232
Okay.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.110
What's your big plan, Jay?

28:58.111 --> 28:59.154
Thank you.

28:59.238 --> 29:03.742
Okay, uh, so, in 2004,
there was a so-called error coin

29:03.825 --> 29:06.495
that surfaced in Tucson and San Antonio.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.898
It was a Wisconsin state quarter.

29:07.954 --> 29:09.915
It had, like,
an extra leaf on the cornstalk.

29:09.998 --> 29:13.001
- So, you want to replicate it?
- Not exactly.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.546
Later on, they looked into
the scientific makeup of the coin,

29:15.629 --> 29:17.839
and figured out
that the error was done on purpose.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.049
How could that happen?

29:19.132 --> 29:23.178
Well, in between the final heat treat
and die hubbing,

29:23.262 --> 29:27.308
the die metal is actually soft enough
that if you have the right tools,

29:27.391 --> 29:29.768
you can make a couple little changes.

29:31.645 --> 29:34.523
If we get a die from one
of the most recent state quarters...

29:34.606 --> 29:37.484
Such as the Wildlife of Michigan
state quarter,

29:37.567 --> 29:41.738
which, according to that pamphlet,
is set to begin production in early March.

29:42.238 --> 29:44.240
- You wanna see it?
- Yeah.

29:45.326 --> 29:47.118
We can make an alteration.

29:47.202 --> 29:49.079
Maybe an extra fin on that fish.

29:49.746 --> 29:50.789
Yeah.

29:50.872 --> 29:52.082
What would that go for?

29:52.165 --> 29:56.211
We could probably sell them for,
like, $5,000 each.

29:57.879 --> 29:59.756
We could make 2,000 coins.

30:00.674 --> 30:02.343
That's, like, 25 pounds.

30:02.426 --> 30:05.471
Okay, so we can
definitely carry 25 pounds.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.314
But how are we gonna
convince coin collectors

30:07.348 --> 30:09.391
that they're worth $5,000 each?

30:12.311 --> 30:15.939
Well, I haven't worked all of it out yet.

30:16.690 --> 30:17.899
But once he does,

30:17.983 --> 30:20.319
we'd be able to make back
half the endowment in six months,

30:20.402 --> 30:23.196
which is enough to keep the school open
for at least another year.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.701
I will figure out
how to get them onto the market.

30:27.784 --> 30:30.245
There are so many steps
between now and then.

30:30.329 --> 30:34.416
First of all,
we need a real staff ID from the Mint.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.128
Once we have that, we can get in
and set this thing up for real.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.009
I have an idea.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.432
Will you get off your phone?

30:51.433 --> 30:53.769
Why? What are you doing?

30:53.852 --> 30:55.204
- Give me the phone. Get off it.
- Hey.

30:55.228 --> 30:56.312
Get off the phone.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.941
- It's expensive.
- Excuse me? Hi.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.652
Hello.

31:01.735 --> 31:03.505
I'm Jenna McNeil.
I'm with the <i>Brown Daily Herald.</i>

31:03.529 --> 31:04.922
I have an appointment with Mr. Garcia.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.698
Are you doing an article on the Mint?

31:06.782 --> 31:08.492
Yes, actually, I am.

31:08.575 --> 31:09.618
Think we might be in it?

31:10.285 --> 31:11.286
Um...

31:11.370 --> 31:12.537
Maybe.

31:12.621 --> 31:13.914
That is exciting.
Go on through.

31:13.997 --> 31:15.416
Thank you.

31:15.499 --> 31:17.709
Uh... Hold on. What did you say
your name was again?

31:17.793 --> 31:19.044
Jenna McNeil.

31:19.920 --> 31:23.089
- Um, I have an appointment at 12:30.
- You don't want her to be late...

31:23.173 --> 31:25.717
No, we didn't hear anything
about a reporter coming in today.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.135
Glen, you don't want her writing

31:27.218 --> 31:30.013
that everything in the Mint
was great except for us, okay?

31:30.096 --> 31:32.265
Go on through.
Let me know if you need a quote...

31:32.348 --> 31:33.892
I still need to see an ID.

31:33.975 --> 31:35.727
Right. Of course.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.443
Hey, are you with the college newspaper?

31:42.526 --> 31:44.736
Yes, I am.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.172
All right. It's okay, guys.
She's with me.

31:46.196 --> 31:47.549
Called yesterday
about doing an interview.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.551
- Yeah, but we got protocol here...
- Glen, it's fine.

31:49.575 --> 31:52.077
- Come on through.
- Thank you.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.037
I'll take you across the production floor.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.997
So, uh, does the article you're writing

31:56.081 --> 31:58.709
have a specific angle
you're looking to emphasize?

31:58.792 --> 32:02.087
Or are you just writing
a general piece about the Mint?

32:02.170 --> 32:06.550
Oh, we just want to know more about
how coins influence the world around us.

32:06.633 --> 32:09.886
Fantastic. That's a great subject
for an article, certainly.

32:09.970 --> 32:13.014
Uh... now, you can't take any photographs
of the production floor,

32:13.098 --> 32:15.538
but, uh, I thought it'd be useful
for you to get a look around

32:15.601 --> 32:18.103
just to get a sense of how things run.

32:24.317 --> 32:26.402
Just keep watch upstairs.

32:26.487 --> 32:28.489
Dakota will text me
when she's at the door.

32:28.572 --> 32:31.867
<i>All right. Let us know
if you see anything down there.</i>

32:38.415 --> 32:40.167
Hey. wait. Wait.
I think I got something.

32:41.793 --> 32:45.005
Will you find Simeone & Sons HVAC
on the schedule when you're in?

32:45.506 --> 32:47.841
You know, there's
something modest about a coin.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.801
You know, there's an element of trust,

32:49.885 --> 32:53.472
in that we all give it value,
and we all agree on that value.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.056
And there's a real purity to that.

32:55.140 --> 32:58.685
That it's a tactile symbol,
you know?

32:59.352 --> 33:01.396
I could talk your ear off.

33:01.897 --> 33:05.275
This facility actually has
a very fascinating history.

33:05.358 --> 33:09.905
You know, I've got some
background information on the first Mint.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.240
A lot of stuff
from the bicentennial celebration.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.325
Would that be helpful for your research?

33:14.409 --> 33:16.077
That would be amazing.
Thank you.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.162
Great.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.164
Let me see.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.589
So, you've got two kids?

33:27.673 --> 33:32.260
Yup. Nate is two,
and Samantha is three and a half.

33:32.928 --> 33:34.805
Wow. That must be a lot
for you and your wife.

33:34.888 --> 33:36.264
Yeah, it is.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.474
I think it's here.

33:39.685 --> 33:42.312
- Jess loves every minute of it.
- I bet.

33:43.354 --> 33:45.273
All right. Here you go.

33:45.356 --> 33:48.443
Actually, um, would you mind
making copies for the editor?

33:48.527 --> 33:49.861
If you don't mind.

33:49.945 --> 33:52.698
- Not a problem.
- Thank you.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.677
Come on. Hurry.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.428
Jason, please.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.725
Okay, how long will this take?

35:01.808 --> 35:03.369
Depends on how complex
the scan is.

35:03.393 --> 35:05.812
We need as much info as possible
to make a good copy.

35:06.312 --> 35:07.397
This way.

38:13.583 --> 38:16.669
All right, I have it for you here.

38:16.752 --> 38:19.630
It's a lot, but I promise you
it's all interesting stuff.

38:19.714 --> 38:20.966
Wow!

39:03.383 --> 39:05.593
Hey! Hey!

39:07.637 --> 39:09.805
My classroom, now.

39:09.890 --> 39:12.130
I know you guys are skipping class,
and I don't know why,

39:12.183 --> 39:13.285
but I'll find out eventually.

39:13.309 --> 39:16.563
So why don't you just tell me now,
before I give you all detention.

39:17.230 --> 39:20.608
But you don't know what we were doing.

39:21.817 --> 39:23.236
- So can we go?
- No.

39:23.319 --> 39:26.406
And I absolutely refuse to believe

39:26.489 --> 39:30.160
that a student who has been suspended,
not once, but three times

39:30.243 --> 39:33.914
for illegal hacking activity
is just skipping class for no reason.

39:33.997 --> 39:35.540
I should probably check your grades.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.226
- Make sure you're not...
- Whoa! I earn my grades.

39:37.250 --> 39:38.250
I'm sure you do.

39:38.293 --> 39:40.795
Man, don't judge her.
That's not what's going on.

39:40.879 --> 39:44.883
I am not "man."
I am Mr. Rankin.

39:47.427 --> 39:51.597
Now, why don't you tell me
how the four of you ended up together?

39:51.681 --> 39:53.281
Why wouldn't the four of us be together?

39:54.017 --> 39:55.060
You know what I mean.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.228
I don't.

39:57.312 --> 40:00.065
We were working on your design project.

40:00.899 --> 40:05.278
It was way more work than we anticipated,
so we decided to help each other.

40:05.361 --> 40:09.490
Skipped a few classes to finish it,
but it won't happen again.

40:10.074 --> 40:12.619
You skipped classes to do school work?

40:14.329 --> 40:15.330
Yeah.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.456
Yeah.

40:20.961 --> 40:23.796
If I can prove
that you were doing something

40:23.879 --> 40:25.548
that you shouldn't be doing...

40:27.050 --> 40:28.134
and I will...

40:29.344 --> 40:31.346
all four of you are going to be expelled.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.599
If there's a school to be expelled from
by the time you figure that out.

40:35.475 --> 40:37.143
That's not my fault, Hodges.

40:40.688 --> 40:41.688
Hey.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.192
You all right?

40:44.734 --> 40:45.860
Yeah, it's fine.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.379
- Bye, guys.
- See you.

40:47.403 --> 40:48.446
Bye.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.949
I'm used to it.

40:51.449 --> 40:52.825
You shouldn't be.

40:52.908 --> 40:54.244
He shouldn't have said that.

40:55.203 --> 40:56.704
You're, uh...

40:56.787 --> 40:58.498
you're better than that.

40:58.581 --> 40:59.665
You're...

41:05.588 --> 41:07.590
Anyway, I'll, uh, see you later.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.178
Thanks for the ride.

41:12.262 --> 41:13.304
Yeah.

41:14.139 --> 41:17.183
I, uh, looked at the reader.
The scan was clean.

41:17.267 --> 41:21.229
So I should be able
to make a copy tonight.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.438
That's good.

41:25.858 --> 41:28.403
You've made IDs before?

41:30.905 --> 41:32.365
Yeah.

41:33.241 --> 41:34.909
Yeah, I've made a few.

41:42.250 --> 41:43.709
- I'm not a criminal, you know.
- No.

41:43.793 --> 41:46.379
No, no, that's not what I meant at all.

41:47.797 --> 41:49.757
I'm sorry.
It's not okay.

41:49.840 --> 41:50.925
I know what it feels like

41:51.009 --> 41:54.929
to have people expect you
to be something that you're not.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.348
- It's not fair.
- Yeah.

41:57.432 --> 41:59.912
It's no secret that I got arrested
before I came to Dennington.

42:01.061 --> 42:02.520
I only made ten IDs.

42:03.188 --> 42:06.274
And I didn't even do it
for the extra cash, you know,

42:06.357 --> 42:07.483
it was...

42:08.818 --> 42:12.572
It was for people in my neighborhood
who were getting stopped by immigration.

42:13.573 --> 42:15.033
Sometimes at Dennington,

42:15.116 --> 42:17.827
I feel like the people
that I made those IDs for.

42:18.411 --> 42:20.455
I'm always being watched

42:20.538 --> 42:24.417
by these people who are just
waiting for me to mess up.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.211
I really don't think that's true.

42:26.294 --> 42:28.088
I mean, they gave you a scholarship.

42:28.171 --> 42:30.340
Yeah, because I'm smart.

42:31.799 --> 42:34.802
I want to go to college.
I want to be an engineer.

42:36.429 --> 42:39.014
I think it's great that
you know what you want to do.

42:41.184 --> 42:44.229
I have all these ideas but...

42:44.312 --> 42:46.397
people keep telling me
that I'm unrealistic.

42:48.608 --> 42:52.487
I have friends here,
but they don't really know who I am.

42:55.490 --> 42:56.991
That's what I'm saying, Dakota.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.827
Just because people expect you
to be something

42:59.910 --> 43:03.831
doesn't mean you have to be it.

43:12.923 --> 43:15.135
You missed the visiting hours again today.

43:15.218 --> 43:17.345
Practicing a little...
What are you doing here?

43:18.263 --> 43:20.181
I just came by to drop off some paperwork.

43:20.265 --> 43:22.850
I saw your mom was packing
all this stuff up herself, so...

43:24.852 --> 43:26.312
Okay, well, I'm here now.

43:26.396 --> 43:30.233
Jason, please, I don't want you
to think of me as the bad guy here.

43:31.192 --> 43:33.044
You're making us move
out of the headmaster's house

43:33.068 --> 43:34.612
before he's even gone to trial.

43:34.695 --> 43:35.696
I'm sorry.

43:35.780 --> 43:40.075
I represent the board.
It's... it's not just my decision.

43:40.159 --> 43:42.370
The president of the board,
that's just a title then?

43:45.248 --> 43:46.541
Um...

43:46.624 --> 43:49.836
I wish I wasn't the one
to have to tell you this, but, uh...

43:50.253 --> 43:52.380
your dad's gonna plead guilty.

43:52.838 --> 43:55.300
They know he broke the law.
There's no way around it.

43:55.383 --> 43:58.303
And even with a plea deal,
he's gonna do time.

43:59.262 --> 44:00.262
You don't know that.

44:06.310 --> 44:07.390
I don't have time for this.

44:13.442 --> 44:15.528
What are you doing?
We got practice at Max's.

44:16.279 --> 44:18.823
I'm just dropping off some of your stuff.

44:18.906 --> 44:20.366
Why? I thought you were driving.

44:22.493 --> 44:23.536
The band wants a break.

44:23.619 --> 44:27.039
What do you mean, "a break"?
We have to play the dance.

44:27.122 --> 44:29.667
Right. Um... the guys...

44:29.750 --> 44:33.003
feel like you're not into this anymore.
You missed practice three times.

44:33.087 --> 44:34.287
What is that supposed to mean?

44:35.548 --> 44:36.549
You know how you are.

44:36.632 --> 44:38.468
You're really into something
until you're not.

44:38.551 --> 44:40.303
You were probably gonna quit anyways.

44:40.803 --> 44:42.763
Look, you... you got a lot going on.

44:42.847 --> 44:44.056
I'm sorry.

44:44.807 --> 44:45.808
See you.

45:01.782 --> 45:03.284
- Hello.
- Hi, Grandma.

45:05.160 --> 45:06.871
How was school today?

45:08.163 --> 45:09.249
Good.

45:10.625 --> 45:12.543
Did you find out about the scholarship?

45:14.169 --> 45:15.963
Not yet.

45:16.047 --> 45:17.840
Well, when are you gonna find out?

45:18.591 --> 45:21.177
I don't know. Soon.

45:21.261 --> 45:24.764
We need to know so we can make a plan
in case it doesn't come through.

45:26.891 --> 45:28.309
I'll talk to them tomorrow.

45:32.146 --> 45:33.230
Okay.

45:39.987 --> 45:42.114
Hey!
I thought I saw you down here.

45:43.198 --> 45:44.950
Why aren't you at Junibel's party?

45:46.536 --> 45:47.787
Uh...

45:50.415 --> 45:51.815
What are you still doing at school?

45:52.667 --> 45:54.252
I was just at the computer lab.

45:54.919 --> 45:57.171
It's kind of nice at night. Quiet.

46:02.552 --> 46:03.594
My dad...

46:05.638 --> 46:07.097
pleaded guilty.

46:07.890 --> 46:08.891
So...

46:11.436 --> 46:12.520
Guess he really did it.

46:13.354 --> 46:14.605
Shit.

46:15.940 --> 46:17.483
I'm so sorry.

46:19.276 --> 46:22.322
I just can't respect him anymore,
you know what I mean?

46:25.240 --> 46:27.117
Parents do shitty things.

46:29.495 --> 46:31.456
I mean...

46:33.040 --> 46:35.876
my parents cheat on each other.

46:35.960 --> 46:37.962
And they think it's fine,

46:38.045 --> 46:42.758
because they come home for dinner
and act like everything is totally normal.

46:45.135 --> 46:46.429
That's awful.

46:48.681 --> 46:51.517
I'm just... used to it.

46:56.814 --> 46:59.654
Yeah, but they're the ones who are
supposed to have their shit together.

47:00.985 --> 47:02.778
- Yeah.
- Have it figured out.

47:04.572 --> 47:07.617
So I think, if they're cheating,

47:07.700 --> 47:10.286
then why can't we cheat
the system a little bit?

47:10.661 --> 47:12.747
If the adults are the ones
who mess things up,

47:12.830 --> 47:15.165
then why do they get to tell us
how it's gonna be?

47:16.542 --> 47:17.627
That's just the thing,

47:17.710 --> 47:20.838
I don't know
that I'm the kind of guy who...

47:24.174 --> 47:26.010
I don't know, um...

47:26.594 --> 47:28.012
Who finishes sentences?

47:28.095 --> 47:31.098
Who finishes anything, apparently.

47:33.934 --> 47:36.937
You're doing your best, I think.

47:39.899 --> 47:41.817
How are you always
so cool about everything?

47:43.277 --> 47:44.487
Cool?

47:44.570 --> 47:46.572
Yeah.

47:47.239 --> 47:50.868
Like, cool and... collected.

47:53.913 --> 47:55.039
And funny, you know.

47:56.081 --> 47:57.207
Resourceful, too.

47:58.167 --> 47:59.168
Resourceful?

47:59.251 --> 48:00.377
Yeah.

48:01.253 --> 48:03.839
Well, now you're just trying
to sound smart again.

48:15.392 --> 48:16.393
Uh...

48:17.102 --> 48:18.103
What?

48:22.692 --> 48:24.652
Maybe we shouldn't complicate things.

48:24.735 --> 48:26.487
We just started...

48:26.571 --> 48:29.615
Right...
and after we're finished,

48:29.699 --> 48:31.259
you'll just pretend that I don't exist.

48:31.325 --> 48:32.827
No, that's not what I'm saying.

48:32.910 --> 48:34.161
- I just think that...
- Sure.

48:34.244 --> 48:37.122
If you need a grade,
or a schedule change,

48:37.206 --> 48:40.626
or to break into a government institution,

48:40.710 --> 48:42.878
I'm sure I'll be
the first person you call.

48:44.213 --> 48:45.213
I have to go.

49:02.231 --> 49:03.232
Hey.

49:05.317 --> 49:06.360
Hey.

49:09.947 --> 49:10.990
I, uh...

49:12.032 --> 49:14.076
I thought you never come to these things.

49:19.206 --> 49:20.290
I, um...

49:22.502 --> 49:24.795
kind of figured you'd be here, so...

49:31.343 --> 49:32.720
Well, I'm glad you did.

49:36.516 --> 49:38.142
I like talking to you.

49:41.270 --> 49:42.479
I like talking to you, too.

49:50.362 --> 49:53.991
I was, um...
I was thinking about what you said.

49:54.074 --> 49:56.368
I was thinking about it a lot, actually.

49:57.870 --> 50:00.080
I'm sorry we didn't get to talk more.
That was stupid.

50:00.831 --> 50:02.249
So I...

50:11.050 --> 50:12.467
We... we can't.

50:15.137 --> 50:16.972
Hey, there's your girlfriend.

50:17.056 --> 50:18.056
Hey, Benny.

50:19.600 --> 50:20.643
What are you doing here?

50:21.226 --> 50:24.313
Wow. Not used to
seeing you at these things.

50:24.396 --> 50:26.481
Guess I didn't realize
I needed your permission

50:26.566 --> 50:27.858
to come to someone else's party.

50:27.942 --> 50:29.542
No, just, you're in North Philly, right?

50:30.570 --> 50:32.572
- How many buses did it take to get here?
- Dylan.

50:32.655 --> 50:34.990
No, I'm... What?
We're just trying to be nice.

50:35.074 --> 50:37.577
- Get to know him a little bit.
- You did time, right?

50:38.368 --> 50:40.162
Before transferring to Dennington?

50:40.245 --> 50:42.247
Not really. No.

50:42.331 --> 50:43.457
Please stop.

50:43.540 --> 50:45.918
What? You actually wanna
hang out with this guy?

50:46.001 --> 50:47.544
Listen, you don't need to be a dick.

50:48.128 --> 50:49.547
Did you just call me a dick?

50:50.089 --> 50:51.924
Seriously, what are you doing here?

50:52.007 --> 50:53.008
- Stop.
- No.

50:54.301 --> 50:57.346
I'm here because I'm friends with Dakota.

50:59.974 --> 51:00.975
Right?

51:03.102 --> 51:04.103
Just go.

51:05.395 --> 51:07.064
Hey, this is nothing.

51:08.941 --> 51:09.984
Please?

51:11.151 --> 51:12.194
She's right.

51:12.278 --> 51:13.571
It's nothing.

51:21.328 --> 51:23.128
You sure you don't wanna
go with your friends?

51:24.623 --> 51:25.623
I don't...

51:26.041 --> 51:29.128
What, do you want me to say it's okay,
so you don't have to feel bad?

51:29.962 --> 51:31.714
Wait, what?

51:31.797 --> 51:34.759
No. No, I get it.
You gotta look out for you.

51:34.842 --> 51:36.927
None of these people care about you.

51:37.803 --> 51:38.846
Isn't that what you said?

51:39.972 --> 51:42.850
No, I said they don't know the real me.

51:42.933 --> 51:44.601
What's the difference?

51:45.811 --> 51:48.230
You're exactly what all these people
think you are.

51:51.483 --> 51:52.610
I think you should leave.

51:55.279 --> 51:56.321
Yeah.

52:13.088 --> 52:14.882
Can we run it one more time, please?

52:15.883 --> 52:16.884
Yeah.

52:18.635 --> 52:21.596
Alice has what she needs
to manipulate the digital inventory,

52:21.681 --> 52:24.599
loop the security feeds
and put the design into production.

52:24.684 --> 52:27.227
Benny's fake die will be used
to replace the real one

52:27.311 --> 52:29.939
that we altered last time and left there.

52:30.022 --> 52:32.566
The fake die is not sturdy enough
to do an actual run,

52:32.649 --> 52:34.401
so it'll probably break.

52:34.484 --> 52:35.527
But when that happens,

52:35.610 --> 52:37.947
they'll just assume
that it was faulty materials

52:38.030 --> 52:39.614
and replace the original on their own.

52:39.699 --> 52:42.993
So, we get in, we do the run,
Alice covers our tracks, virtually,

52:43.077 --> 52:44.745
and we get out.

52:44.829 --> 52:46.163
If we get in.

52:46.246 --> 52:49.458
You realize, if this doesn't go perfectly,
we are all going to jail?

52:50.042 --> 52:51.210
Dakota, would you just...

52:51.293 --> 52:55.047
Have you even spoken to your dad yet, Jay?
Do you realize how bad this could be?

52:55.130 --> 52:56.966
- Would you just shut up?
- She's right.

52:57.049 --> 52:58.884
The production floor is complicated.

52:58.968 --> 53:00.803
And we're entirely relying on the fake IDs

53:00.886 --> 53:02.888
actually getting us in
as the HVAC company.

53:02.972 --> 53:04.681
The IDs will work.

53:04.765 --> 53:06.492
If anything goes wrong,
it's not gonna be on me.

53:06.516 --> 53:07.601
How can you be so sure?

53:07.684 --> 53:08.685
Seriously?

53:08.769 --> 53:11.289
You're gonna question me after you
barely made it past security?

53:11.688 --> 53:12.815
I got us in, didn't I?

53:13.733 --> 53:14.984
If something goes wrong...

53:15.067 --> 53:16.787
Stop saying
that something's gonna go wrong.

53:16.819 --> 53:18.421
I don't know what else
you want from me, here.

53:18.445 --> 53:19.965
I'm doing everything I know how to do.

53:20.781 --> 53:21.782
Okay?

53:22.699 --> 53:24.576
So, let's all relax...

53:25.535 --> 53:26.615
and figure out what's next.

53:26.661 --> 53:28.038
What else do we need?

53:33.460 --> 53:36.046
Well, I need a song list
for the Winter Formal on Saturday.

53:37.089 --> 53:38.090
Yeah.

53:40.092 --> 53:42.887
About that. They, uh...
The band has split up.

53:42.970 --> 53:43.971
What?

53:45.097 --> 53:47.808
- When were you planning on telling me?
- It's complicated.

53:47.891 --> 53:50.602
You never go through with things!
No wonder your band split up!

53:50.685 --> 53:52.687
And, by the way, what about the quarters?

53:52.772 --> 53:54.875
How are we gonna sell them?
Have you thought about that?

53:54.899 --> 53:56.191
I'm still working on that part.

53:56.275 --> 53:57.919
I don't know how you
expect people to trust you

53:57.943 --> 53:59.778
when you haven't even
thought things through.

54:01.613 --> 54:04.116
- Jay...
- Would you stop calling me Jay, Dakota?

54:04.199 --> 54:06.201
Look, we're not together anymore.
You don't own me.

54:06.285 --> 54:08.245
I will get your music,
I will get the coins,

54:08.328 --> 54:10.622
and I will figure out everything
for everybody.

54:10.705 --> 54:12.291
Okay? Does that sound good?

54:15.210 --> 54:17.797
Does anybody else need anything
while I'm at it?

54:24.219 --> 54:25.888
You know what? This...

54:27.807 --> 54:29.099
This is over.

54:31.393 --> 54:34.188
Alice, take the coin out of production.
Delete it.

54:35.064 --> 54:36.106
Jason...

54:36.690 --> 54:37.690
Just do it.

54:47.827 --> 54:48.869
Good job.

54:52.915 --> 54:53.916
You know what? Yeah.

54:53.999 --> 54:56.210
This was a shit idea from the very start.

55:05.802 --> 55:07.804
Thanks for coming.

55:07.888 --> 55:10.390
I'm sorry you have to see me like this.

55:11.642 --> 55:13.018
How could you do it?

55:13.518 --> 55:16.605
Not just to me, but to Mom.
And the school.

55:16.688 --> 55:19.024
Everybody you know.
How could you be so selfish?

55:20.067 --> 55:21.110
It's not like that.

55:23.070 --> 55:27.616
The board, they rejected my proposals
for investing in new programs.

55:27.699 --> 55:29.243
They didn't wanna take a risk.

55:30.702 --> 55:32.955
- And Harold Smerconish and I...
- Wait. Wait.

55:33.038 --> 55:35.249
Smerconish knew about this?

55:35.790 --> 55:38.085
He didn't agree
with the rest of the board.

55:38.168 --> 55:40.795
He said that I should go through
with the investments.

55:40.880 --> 55:44.591
So I transferred the money
into a private bank account.

55:46.051 --> 55:49.763
And he said he wouldn't tell the rest
of the board until it had paid off.

55:49.846 --> 55:50.847
That was the plan.

55:53.433 --> 55:55.019
It's not what you think.

55:56.311 --> 55:58.438
I just wanted to make a real difference.

56:05.862 --> 56:08.049
<i>I know
you're blowing off steam, or whatever,</i>

56:08.073 --> 56:10.159
but can you not murder
everyone in this village

56:10.242 --> 56:11.868
<i>before we finish the quest?</i>

56:15.205 --> 56:16.498
Sorry.

56:18.250 --> 56:20.502
Yeah, it's okay.
I know it sucks.

56:20.585 --> 56:22.129
<i>Yeah, it sucks, but, like,</i>

56:22.212 --> 56:23.213
what would you do?

56:23.297 --> 56:25.966
We worked really hard on our whole...

56:26.341 --> 56:30.054
design project thing,
and now everyone just wants to drop out.

56:30.721 --> 56:32.639
So what?
Just make a new group.

56:33.182 --> 56:37.269
I don't know, maybe include
your best friend, me, next time?

56:37.352 --> 56:39.021
It's not like that, Greg.

56:39.104 --> 56:40.855
We were doing something important.

56:40.940 --> 56:42.482
Something that really mattered.

56:42.566 --> 56:44.443
Like what?
Extra credit?

56:46.070 --> 56:48.405
Um... yeah.

56:49.781 --> 56:50.782
Yeah.

56:51.950 --> 56:53.201
Okay. Uh...

56:53.285 --> 56:56.705
Well, if it were me, I would just go ahead
and sign up for the extra credit anyway.

56:56.788 --> 56:59.374
<i>And tell them you already signed up
and it's too late to bail,</i>

56:59.458 --> 57:00.960
<i>especially with all the work you did.</i>

57:01.752 --> 57:03.587
Then they'd have to help you finish it.

57:05.589 --> 57:08.092
You know, that's not the worst idea.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.637
<i>Important decisions
should not be left</i>

57:11.720 --> 57:13.472
<i>to the Jason Hodges of the world.</i>

57:14.306 --> 57:16.066
<i>Who knows,
they'll probably thank you for it.</i>

57:21.480 --> 57:23.648
- Shit, I did it.
- Good.

57:23.732 --> 57:25.943
See, you just had to get it over with.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.449
No. No. No. Saturday?
That's too soon!

57:35.702 --> 57:38.098
<i>I never had a teacher who made me
turn something in on the weekend.</i>

57:38.122 --> 57:40.082
Wait, isn't that the night of the dance?

57:41.000 --> 57:44.253
That's cruel.
Rankin is such an asshole.

57:47.547 --> 57:48.757
No way.

57:48.840 --> 57:50.050
It's locked.

57:50.134 --> 57:53.012
I'm so sorry.
It was an accident.

57:55.847 --> 57:57.724
What day is it scheduled for?

57:58.767 --> 58:00.019
Saturday.

58:00.978 --> 58:04.064
- Winter Formal? Are you kidding?
- Nope.

58:04.148 --> 58:08.610
Maybe we just let Alice's queue
run on its own.

58:08.693 --> 58:10.612
If no one actually puts the die
in the machine,

58:10.695 --> 58:12.131
it won't be able to stamp the design.

58:12.155 --> 58:13.955
Maybe they'll think
the machine malfunctioned.

58:13.991 --> 58:15.867
Either way, we're screwed.

58:15.950 --> 58:17.286
If we don't show up on Saturday,

58:17.369 --> 58:20.747
then the die that we altered will go
into the machine in a few weeks.

58:21.331 --> 58:22.332
Hacking isn't fool proof.

58:22.416 --> 58:25.044
If they suspect something,
they'll trace it back to us.

58:29.256 --> 58:31.633
So we have to go through with it.
We'll skip the dance.

58:31.716 --> 58:35.887
No, I'm on the committee.
And you still owe me for the music.

58:35.970 --> 58:38.307
Jason, the school needs this.

58:38.390 --> 58:41.351
And if I'm still in charge of alibis,
I'm not letting either of us miss it.

58:41.435 --> 58:44.146
Especially with Rankin on our case.
It's too suspicious.

58:45.272 --> 58:49.484
Well, only one or two of us can actually
go as the HVAC company, right?

58:51.153 --> 58:54.322
- So you and me, we'll...
- I was thinking Benny and I.

58:54.823 --> 58:56.199
- You were?
- Yeah.

58:56.700 --> 58:58.202
I mean, I'm down.

59:02.456 --> 59:03.457
Okay.

59:06.085 --> 59:08.212
I'll work on getting
the band back together,

59:08.295 --> 59:10.172
so Dakota can pull off this stupid dance.

59:10.255 --> 59:13.675
It is the Winter Formal.

59:13.759 --> 59:16.094
It's not stupid. It's important.

59:16.178 --> 59:18.180
Not stupid. It's important.

59:18.263 --> 59:21.433
Benny and Alice, you guys will go in
as the HVAC company.

59:21.516 --> 59:23.852
Otherwise, the plan should stay the same.

59:23.935 --> 59:25.395
- All right.
- All right.

59:36.406 --> 59:38.325
Zack, I need this.

59:39.451 --> 59:40.452
No way, dude.

59:42.621 --> 59:44.539
I lost everything
because of what my dad did.

59:44.623 --> 59:46.500
Don't do this to me, too.

59:49.586 --> 59:50.670
Let's play the dance.

59:52.464 --> 59:53.965
Just one last gig.

59:56.801 --> 59:58.011
It's also our first gig.

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:01.305
One gig.

01:00:01.723 --> 01:00:04.101
But this doesn't mean
the band's back together.

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:05.185
Deal.

01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:06.496
- You going?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:08.707
- You look nice.
- Thanks.

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:16.214
I just wanted to tell you,
I know I haven't been very helpful...

01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:18.300
with everything.

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:22.554
I'm sorry.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:27.559
It's okay.

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:30.687
Thanks.

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:32.189
Have a good time.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:10.685
You look nice.

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:12.186
Likewise.

01:02:12.271 --> 01:02:14.105
Wait!

01:02:14.188 --> 01:02:16.149
Where do you think you're going?

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:18.401
This is Benny, my date.

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.029
You guys aren't leaving.

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:23.490
- Not yet.
- Not without pictures!

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.992
Come on in!

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:28.703
Come on!

01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:30.372
Okay, you two, get together.

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:34.626
- We have to go.
- Oh, bye, sweetie!

01:02:35.294 --> 01:02:37.296
Wow!

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.507
You guys really ran
with the whole lunch thing.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.384
Weren't we supposed to?

01:02:42.467 --> 01:02:44.386
Yeah.

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:46.971
- It looks amazing. Good job.
- Thanks.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.105
Hey! Why aren't you guys rehearsing?

01:02:57.065 --> 01:02:58.817
Zack's not here.
He's our singer.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:03.447
What? For real?
All right. All right. Okay.

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:06.616
He's not coming.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:09.077
- What?
- Food poisoning.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.244
Well, we need a singer.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:13.873
- I guess we gotta call it off, then.
- No!

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:16.918
People are depending on us.

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:19.796
We can't play without a singer.

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:21.756
I mean, we can try to do it
karaoke style.

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:25.510
Dakota.

01:03:25.594 --> 01:03:26.845
No.

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:29.639
Dakota.

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:33.476
You do know all the songs.

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.187
No. I am not singing.

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:37.790
When we were still together,

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:40.054
you helped me write
practically every single one of them.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.903
There would be no band without you.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.410
Okay. Let me see the set list.

01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:55.790
So you made sure we're
on the HVAC schedule, right?

01:03:55.874 --> 01:03:56.874
Yes.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:58.543
And Dakota called and...

01:03:58.626 --> 01:04:01.796
said that the regular HVAC guys
won't be there, right?

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.048
Yeah, she called and sent an e-mail.

01:04:05.216 --> 01:04:07.677
And you're gonna be able
to loop the security footage?

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:10.054
Yeah, it's all ready, on my computer.

01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:12.181
It's fine. We're fine.

01:04:13.392 --> 01:04:17.020
It's going well already.
Going well.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:18.438
Yeah.

01:04:27.406 --> 01:04:28.532
Can I help you?

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:31.325
Yeah, we're here with
Simeone & Sons HVAC.

01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:33.787
Just doing some scheduled maintenance.

01:04:34.746 --> 01:04:35.872
Who's that?

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:38.417
That is my niece.

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.003
- Your niece?
- Yup.

01:04:42.086 --> 01:04:44.255
Just brought her along for the night.

01:04:44.338 --> 01:04:48.134
Doing a little internship,
apprenticeship-type thing.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:55.349
If it's a problem, you know,
she can just wait in the van.

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:03.691
Boiler room.
You know the way.

01:05:25.797 --> 01:05:27.591
How long is this gonna take?

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:32.261
Okay, got it. Let's go.

01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:49.070
No, no, no.

01:05:49.153 --> 01:05:51.322
No, you guys don't need to come.

01:05:52.323 --> 01:05:55.368
I called last night and said
that we don't need you.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:57.454
I don't understand... Hello?

01:05:58.455 --> 01:05:59.456
Shit.

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.377
What?

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:07.338
The HVAC guy is still coming.
I couldn't stop him.

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:11.342
Then we gotta go.

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.932
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:06:18.016 --> 01:06:19.851
Where are you guys going?

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:21.435
We got a band emergency.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.913
So we have to get back
to the rental place.

01:06:22.937 --> 01:06:25.857
- We'll be back in, like, an hour.
- But you go on in an hour.

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.066
Yeah, exactly.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:28.902
- See you then.
- Bye.

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:42.123
I got it. I got it.

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:55.154
Right there.

01:08:55.674 --> 01:08:58.091
Okay, Jason and Dakota are coming...

01:08:58.176 --> 01:09:00.886
and so is the actual HVAC guy.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.971
- Shit.
- God.

01:09:32.292 --> 01:09:34.921
- Oh, my God.
- What is that?

01:09:37.716 --> 01:09:39.759
I think the machines
are starting up again.

01:09:45.389 --> 01:09:46.808
No.
No, no, no, no.

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:48.727
- Shit.
- What do we do?

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:55.649
- What's going on?
- The sequence is queued up ten times.

01:09:55.734 --> 01:09:56.860
What does that mean?

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:59.320
We're making 20,000 quarters.

01:10:14.002 --> 01:10:15.503
- Alice.
- What?

01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:17.005
We need the guitar case.

01:10:23.427 --> 01:10:25.304
We already let your guys in.

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:27.348
They showed up about 20 minutes ago.

01:10:27.431 --> 01:10:29.350
That's so weird.

01:10:29.433 --> 01:10:31.978
Somebody called me,
told me not to come in.

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:35.356
I just want to check out our duct work
from last week. That okay?

01:10:35.439 --> 01:10:36.816
One second.

01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:41.570
I need you to check the boiler room.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:43.531
<i>We might have a situation.</i>

01:10:44.698 --> 01:10:45.950
Ten-four.

01:11:04.969 --> 01:11:06.179
We've got a problem.

01:11:07.555 --> 01:11:09.140
They're not here.

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:32.622
Okay. They're right here.

01:11:54.518 --> 01:11:55.519
In there!

01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:08.199
Great.

01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:10.451
- Hi. You wanted back up?
- Not you two.

01:12:10.534 --> 01:12:14.247
- What's wrong with us two?
- Nothing. Follow me.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:15.331
Hurry up!

01:12:19.878 --> 01:12:21.398
What are you doing?

01:12:22.213 --> 01:12:23.982
We're only gonna have five minutes

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:27.176
until the feeds are live,
after I reset the security cameras.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.182
Alice, I don't...

01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:34.683
We gotta go.

01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:44.568
Hey, I'm sorry about what I said
the other day.

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.281
It's just...

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:50.366
You know, I like you.

01:12:58.332 --> 01:12:59.583
Yeah...

01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:00.667
Let's go.

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:05.673
- Watch the monitors.
- All right. All right.

01:13:05.756 --> 01:13:08.092
- What about us?
- Just stay out of the way.

01:13:09.177 --> 01:13:10.428
The ducts are good.

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:41.208
Alice!

01:13:46.797 --> 01:13:48.174
- Try it when I tell you.
- Okay.

01:13:49.884 --> 01:13:50.884
Okay.

01:13:57.475 --> 01:13:58.476
Try it!

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:22.875
I don't see 'em.

01:14:25.919 --> 01:14:27.588
They have to be here.

01:14:29.007 --> 01:14:30.258
Parking garage is empty!

01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:33.511
Damn it.

01:14:44.105 --> 01:14:46.690
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:14:58.036 --> 01:14:59.662
Someone's watching us.

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:04.500
Rankin.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:06.044
He followed us.

01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:08.171
Okay.

01:15:08.254 --> 01:15:09.838
Come on.

01:15:43.622 --> 01:15:45.583
Have you guys seen Hodges and Dakota?

01:15:46.584 --> 01:15:48.836
Guys, have you seen Hodges and Dakota?

01:15:48.919 --> 01:15:50.629
Okay, it's our job to chaperone.

Hey, I thought you had
a project due tonight.

01:18:25.075 --> 01:18:27.620
We just turned it in, actually.

01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:32.082
Then why are you just standing here
looking so miserable?

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:38.381
I'm sorry, Greg.

01:18:39.423 --> 01:18:41.008
For what?

01:18:41.091 --> 01:18:42.091
You were right.

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:47.139
I thought it was more than a project,
but they were just using me.

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:48.432
Like you said.

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:00.528
I don't know about that.

01:19:03.113 --> 01:19:08.327
It seems like he does
actually like you for some reason.

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:11.038
I mean, like, he's staring at you.
Like, right now.

01:19:14.542 --> 01:19:15.709
It's kind of weird.

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:21.131
I'll see you around.

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:41.735
Dakota, that was incredible.

01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:43.654
Thanks.
Where are you going?

01:19:45.989 --> 01:19:49.618
- Can you play the next one without me?
- You're the lead guitarist, we can't.

01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:53.706
- Great job.
- Thanks. You, too.

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:55.207
Wait like five minutes.

01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:59.252
Hey, look, you can't be back here.

01:19:59.337 --> 01:20:00.417
I thought you were my date.

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:02.607
I haven't seen you all night.
Now you're back here with Hodges?

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.633
I was on stage singing with the band.

01:20:04.717 --> 01:20:07.010
- Yeah, when did that happen?
- Does it matter?

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:12.850
- Let's go back to the limo and hang out.
- No!

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:15.811
I think we should break up.

01:20:16.937 --> 01:20:17.938
What?

01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:21.191
This isn't working out anymore.

01:20:23.611 --> 01:20:24.987
Are you kidding me?

01:20:28.365 --> 01:20:29.867
What are you doing out here?

01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:32.370
I don't know.

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:37.583
Aren't you in the middle
of your big performance or whatever?

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:44.673
I asked for a break.

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:51.555
I didn't mean to mess things up with you.

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:57.895
Just wanted to say that.

01:20:57.978 --> 01:20:59.187
And, uh...

01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:01.899
I'm sorry.

01:21:08.238 --> 01:21:09.490
Found your chicken burger.

01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:11.575
Let's go, now.

01:21:21.251 --> 01:21:22.711
Open it.

01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:32.555
What's in the toolbox, Jason?

01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:35.265
Open it, Jason.

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:55.243
Okay.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:59.289
Now we call the cops.

01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:03.586
...during a very challenging semester.

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:07.047
We would particularly like to thank
the President of the Board,

01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:09.341
Harold Smerconish.

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:13.762
Thank you, Ms. Coyle.

01:22:13.846 --> 01:22:17.224
And thank you, Dennington Prep students.

01:22:17.307 --> 01:22:20.185
I know it's not fair
that you've had to sacrifice

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:22.605
your extracurricular activities
and programs.

01:22:22.688 --> 01:22:25.441
But I thought you should know
that your headmaster...

01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:28.777
your former headmaster...

01:22:29.486 --> 01:22:32.197
will be facing consequences
for his actions.

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:34.450
Now, uh...

01:22:34.533 --> 01:22:37.369
- Wait.
- No. Now is not the time, Hodges.

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:39.580
Before you call the police,

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:43.083
don't you think the President of the Board
would want to know first?

01:22:44.168 --> 01:22:47.004
Thank you
for letting me have these words with you

01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:49.590
and enjoy the rest of your Winter Formal.

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:51.341
Good night.

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:54.762
Jason, what are you doing?

01:22:57.014 --> 01:22:59.224
Sir. Sir, hi.
Hi, I'm... I'm Todd.

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:02.435
- Todd Rankin.
- Ah.

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.605
I teach art and design.
We've met before.

01:23:04.688 --> 01:23:07.524
Um... can I just have
a moment of your time?

01:23:10.861 --> 01:23:11.862
Sure.

01:23:12.404 --> 01:23:13.404
Jason.

01:23:14.448 --> 01:23:15.448
Dakota.

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:17.158
Follow me.

01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:28.879
This is a very serious situation.

01:23:28.962 --> 01:23:30.857
Mmm-hmm.
They've been planning it for a while.

01:23:30.881 --> 01:23:31.961
They've been skipping class

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:34.510
and tonight I found out
that they were using school resources.

01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:36.929
I've heard enough.
Let me see the quarter.

01:23:47.147 --> 01:23:50.025
So, here's what's going to happen.

01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:52.736
You're going to give
everything you have to me,

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:55.573
I'll handle turning it all over
to the authorities.

01:23:55.656 --> 01:23:57.783
I'd advise the four of you to get lawyers,

01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:01.411
as the police will undoubtedly
start asking questions quite soon.

01:24:01.494 --> 01:24:03.330
Needless to say, you're all expelled.

01:24:03.413 --> 01:24:06.625
We'll take care of this as quietly
as possible, and that'll be the end of it.

01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:15.175
You don't understand.
We did all of this for the school.

01:24:15.258 --> 01:24:17.510
We love Dennington!
You have to believe us.

01:24:17.594 --> 01:24:19.555
I do believe you, Dakota.

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:23.559
But that doesn't alter the fact
that your actions were highly illegal,

01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:25.185
which comes at a price.

01:24:25.268 --> 01:24:27.855
The last thing we want for Dennington Prep

01:24:27.938 --> 01:24:31.316
is to be in the headlines again
for fraudulent activity.

01:24:31.608 --> 01:24:34.528
You know all about handling
fraudulent activity, don't you?

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:36.154
Excuse me?

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:40.033
I know that you gave my dad the go-ahead
on investing the school's endowment.

01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:43.704
We're talking
about an entirely different matter here.

01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:45.122
This has nothing to do with that.

01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:47.625
Yeah.

01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:49.501
You're always gonna save yourself.

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:52.671
Okay, Jason, this is highly
inappropriate behavior right now.

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:54.673
I'm just trying to help
Mr. Smerconish here.

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:57.550
I mean,
if he really wants to save himself,

01:24:57.635 --> 01:24:59.845
he won't turn these quarters
over to the police.

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:01.763
Of course he will.

01:25:02.139 --> 01:25:03.557
What are you saying, Jason?

01:25:04.057 --> 01:25:07.770
I'm saying that the error coin we created
has never existed before.

01:25:09.062 --> 01:25:11.898
By introducing it to auction houses
at strategic times,

01:25:11.982 --> 01:25:14.693
you could have one of the most
valuable coins on the market,

01:25:15.277 --> 01:25:17.070
and you would own the entire collection.

01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:18.864
And the Mint?

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:20.365
They don't know.

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:22.367
They'll never know
how it happened.

01:25:23.661 --> 01:25:25.954
They will be able to verify
the authenticity of that coin.

01:25:26.789 --> 01:25:28.415
Okay, this is insane.

01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:34.212
How did you do this?

01:25:36.048 --> 01:25:40.177
Um... He can't really get
too into that.

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.181
What do you want for them?

01:25:44.264 --> 01:25:47.476
Sir, you're not actually
considering this as a possibility.

01:25:49.352 --> 01:25:52.815
Immunity. For all of us.

01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:56.777
And a guarantee
you'll fill the school's endowment

01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.070
with an anonymous donation.

01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:00.572
What is happening?

01:26:01.699 --> 01:26:03.200
Let me see all of them.

01:26:17.547 --> 01:26:18.547
Is this it?

01:26:19.842 --> 01:26:20.926
Yeah.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:22.886
Are you sure?

01:26:22.969 --> 01:26:25.097
Because we could certainly do
a lot more business

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:27.057
if you hand all of them over to me, son.

01:26:28.391 --> 01:26:29.685
I am very sure.

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:31.978
Two thousand quarters.

01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:34.147
Do we have a deal?

01:26:36.483 --> 01:26:39.527
Fine. Deal.

01:26:40.904 --> 01:26:42.030
Eh... Sir, I'm sorry...

01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:44.241
Excuse me, but I don't think
it's a really good idea

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:46.052
to be enabling these kids
in starting some...

01:26:46.076 --> 01:26:49.121
Yeah, uh, thanks
for bringing them here, Mr., um...

01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:50.247
Rankin!

01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:53.083
Todd Rankin!
We have met a thousand times!

01:26:53.166 --> 01:26:54.835
I teach art and design!

01:26:54.918 --> 01:26:58.922
I think you should stop
shouting at these kids, Mr. Rankin.

01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:02.092
They've done us all a big favor.

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:05.095
Saved your job.

01:27:21.153 --> 01:27:22.780
How'd you know that would work?

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:24.780
I didn't.

01:27:25.615 --> 01:27:27.367
But I watched a lot of heist movies.

01:27:27.450 --> 01:27:29.702
What are we gonna do
with the rest of the coins?

01:27:30.788 --> 01:27:34.374
You're smart kids.
Get rid of them.

01:27:36.293 --> 01:27:37.795
I'll see you guys Monday.

01:27:43.884 --> 01:27:45.260
I got an idea.

01:28:19.837 --> 01:28:21.171
It's not half bad.

01:28:23.298 --> 01:28:24.632
I kind of like it.

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:27.427
It's literally made of money.

01:28:33.016 --> 01:28:34.226
Last four.

01:28:47.614 --> 01:28:49.491
You got anywhere you need to be?

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:51.869
Not right now.

01:28:55.288 --> 01:28:56.789
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

01:28:56.874 --> 01:28:58.000
See you.

01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:02.838
So...

01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:08.176
is your boyfriend coming to pick you up?

01:29:09.469 --> 01:29:11.804
No, that's over.

01:29:18.311 --> 01:29:19.479
Hey...

01:29:20.688 --> 01:29:23.233
I'm really sorry
I let him talk to you like that.

01:29:24.734 --> 01:29:26.611
Yeah. That...

01:29:27.737 --> 01:29:29.739
that was the worst.

01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:31.909
I know.

01:29:38.999 --> 01:29:40.417
You want to start over?

01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:56.474
It's funny, I thought this whole thing...

01:29:58.018 --> 01:30:00.520
was about following through
with something good.

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:02.897
Different.

01:30:04.482 --> 01:30:06.109
At the end of the day, I think...

01:30:07.152 --> 01:30:09.821
people like Smerconish,
they're the ones who always win.

01:30:11.489 --> 01:30:15.660
I think... we did what we had to do.

01:30:19.581 --> 01:30:21.708
I'm not coming back to school in the fall.

01:30:21.791 --> 01:30:23.835
What? Why?

01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:25.545
We just saved the school.

01:30:27.297 --> 01:30:29.924
I just don't want to be
my dad's legacy here.

01:30:33.511 --> 01:30:35.013
I want to leave all of that behind.

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:41.103
With the statue and everything
that we did here tonight.

01:30:42.312 --> 01:30:43.312
Okay.

01:30:46.816 --> 01:30:48.526
I'm not skipping town or anything.

01:30:53.406 --> 01:30:58.536
Getting to know you... has been...

01:30:59.996 --> 01:31:03.959
one of the best things to happen to me
in a... a really long time.

01:31:08.004 --> 01:31:11.132
I'm not just gonna give all that up
because I'm moving schools.

01:31:15.845 --> 01:31:17.097
You're so smart.

01:31:21.059 --> 01:31:25.855
Good at, um... knowing who you are.
I'm...

01:31:26.939 --> 01:31:29.651
I'm still trying to learn how to do that.

01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:30.902
So...

01:31:32.779 --> 01:31:34.823
I don't know if this is making any sense.

01:31:38.285 --> 01:31:39.577
What?

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:45.125
You know,
if you're trying to sound smart,

01:31:45.208 --> 01:31:47.835
I think it might actually
be working this time.

01:31:47.919 --> 01:31:49.003
Yeah?

01:31:49.087 --> 01:31:50.338
Yeah.
