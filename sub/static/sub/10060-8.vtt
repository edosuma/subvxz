WEBVTT

00:17.250 --> 00:18.542
FRAN: Showing your
vagina to your boss

00:18.542 --> 00:20.083
is not an OK thing to do.

00:20.083 --> 00:21.583
It wasn't sexual, Fran.

00:21.583 --> 00:23.333
It was so I would
get out of trouble.

00:23.333 --> 00:25.083
-We got the call.
-What does she want?

00:25.083 --> 00:26.166
What she wants

00:26.166 --> 00:28.333
is a matter of waiting,
on grays...

00:28.333 --> 00:29.500
MARNIE:
We have to make this work.

00:29.708 --> 00:31.417
-JESSA: Ready for everything?
-Wait, what do you mean?

00:31.417 --> 00:33.625
Everybody. Isn't everybody
coming tonight?

00:34.250 --> 00:36.583
You and me and--
In front of them.

00:36.583 --> 00:38.250
ADAM: I'm just gonna
be acting most of the time.

00:38.250 --> 00:41.875
You keep a guy named Shane
downstairs for sometimes sex.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.917
There's always gonna be
people in your ear.

00:44.125 --> 00:45.834
I'm really fucking lonely.

00:45.834 --> 00:47.542
I really have to go home.

00:47.542 --> 00:48.917
Are Jess and Adam fucking?

00:48.917 --> 00:49.834
Oh, come on.

00:50.166 --> 00:51.500
Seriously, Marnie,
If you know anything,

00:51.500 --> 00:52.875
I can take it.

01:02.291 --> 01:03.792
( chatter )

01:03.792 --> 01:06.750
( man on P.A.,
indistinct )

01:15.667 --> 01:19.792
Excuse-- excuse--
are you-- are you serious?

01:19.792 --> 01:22.333
You couldn't wait
like one second

01:22.333 --> 01:24.542
for me to exit
this moving walkway?

01:24.542 --> 01:26.708
This country
is bullshit, okay.

01:26.708 --> 01:29.542
Nobody has any manners,
and you wanna know why?
Do you wanna know why?

01:29.542 --> 01:32.625
'Cause you're all
so self-involved
and self-serving

01:32.625 --> 01:33.875
and your behavior
here today, sir,

01:33.875 --> 01:38.291
was a perfect embodiment
of that truth, okay?

01:38.291 --> 01:40.500
Why am I here?

01:43.333 --> 01:45.458
Why am I here?

01:45.458 --> 01:48.041
♪ Here I am
again in the city... ♪

01:48.041 --> 01:49.333
( screams )

01:49.333 --> 01:51.625

01:51.625 --> 01:54.000

♪ I'm back, back

02:05.750 --> 02:09.166
Okay, I do not love
that the toilet's
in the shower.

02:09.166 --> 02:12.542
Fran:
Small price to pay
for freedom, buddy.

02:14.667 --> 02:17.708
I've been eating Bugles
my whole life and I still
don't even know if I like them.

02:17.708 --> 02:19.375
It's just, like,
something to do.

02:20.625 --> 02:23.708
Ah, I love this.
We are on the road.

02:23.708 --> 02:26.917
We can do
whatever we want
for the whole summer.

02:26.917 --> 02:29.333
And it's just us.

02:29.333 --> 02:31.583
It is just us.

02:31.583 --> 02:33.291
For the next
three months.

02:33.291 --> 02:36.417
We don't have
to deal with the kids
or the administration

02:36.417 --> 02:40.917
or Elijah
or your needy friends.

02:40.917 --> 02:43.750
It's just us.

03:07.917 --> 03:09.583
Be right back, babe.

03:19.417 --> 03:21.583
( exhales )

03:22.792 --> 03:24.792
( phone chimes )

03:33.959 --> 03:35.667
( phone buzzes )

03:37.250 --> 03:38.291
Hello?

03:38.291 --> 03:39.625
What the hell's
going on?

03:39.625 --> 03:41.125
I don't want
to go on the trip.

03:41.125 --> 03:42.625
I think you should
just go without me.

03:42.625 --> 03:45.458
Hannah, what the hell?
I'm coming in.

03:45.458 --> 03:47.792
Listen, I really didn't
want to go on the trip,

03:47.792 --> 03:49.166
but I didn't want
to be a wet blanket,

03:49.166 --> 03:50.750
and then you rented
the house car, okay?

03:50.750 --> 03:52.583
And just please
don't come in here.

03:52.583 --> 03:55.583
- Hannah, it's me.
- Nope.

03:55.583 --> 03:58.959
- Are you serious?
- I really don't want
you to come in here.

03:58.959 --> 04:00.917
Hannah, open the door.

04:02.625 --> 04:03.625
Hey.

04:03.625 --> 04:05.000
Why are you
running from me?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.667
Hannah.

04:07.625 --> 04:09.166
What the--?

04:09.166 --> 04:10.625
I am not a monster.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.083
Define monster!

04:12.083 --> 04:13.834
Tell me
what is going on.

04:13.834 --> 04:16.083
I don't want to be
in this relationship anymore

04:16.083 --> 04:17.791
and I don't know
how to get out!

04:17.791 --> 04:21.250
- ( clattering )
- Fran: Ow! Shit!

04:21.250 --> 04:23.625
- Will you just stop
so I can talk to you, please?
- No!

04:23.625 --> 04:25.250
- I feel like I'm hunting you.
- Leave me alone!

04:25.250 --> 04:27.166
I feel like this is
"The Most Dangerous Game."

04:27.166 --> 04:28.625
- Hannah: Please!
- Come on.

04:28.625 --> 04:31.750
- Just stop-- oh!
- Fran: Shit.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.166
Are you all right?

04:33.166 --> 04:35.083
Could you please
just stop?

04:35.083 --> 04:37.333
- Stay away, okay?
- Just stop running

04:37.333 --> 04:39.000
and talk to me
like an adult.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.625
Please, I don't
want to talk, okay?

04:41.625 --> 04:43.417
I don't
want to do this.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.750
I don't belong
with you.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.542
I'm sorry.
Please go.

04:49.166 --> 04:51.792
Fuck!

04:51.792 --> 04:53.542
This is ridiculous.

04:55.166 --> 04:57.708
Fine! We are
breaking up, I guess.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.333
That's it.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.708
So, let me drive you
back to the city.

05:01.708 --> 05:03.708
- Let's go.
- I'll be fine here, okay?

05:03.708 --> 05:05.583
I can't get back
in the house car.

05:05.583 --> 05:07.250
I am offering
to take you back.

05:07.250 --> 05:09.583
That's just me
being a nice person,
all right?

05:09.583 --> 05:11.208
God, you're
so fucking selfish.

05:11.208 --> 05:13.375
Please, just go, Fran.

05:13.375 --> 05:15.125
You know what?
My brother thought

05:15.125 --> 05:17.875
you were so fuckin' rude,
and he was right.

05:17.875 --> 05:20.542
He fucking handwrote a letter
saying how rude you were.

05:20.542 --> 05:22.542
That's how much
he meant it.

05:22.542 --> 05:24.458
I can't believe
I wasted an entire year

05:24.458 --> 05:26.834
hanging out
with your rude ass.

05:26.834 --> 05:28.333
Seriously.

05:28.333 --> 05:32.875
You know what?
Have a great summer, okay?

05:34.250 --> 05:36.417
Fuck you.

05:40.708 --> 05:43.041
( engine starts )

05:46.542 --> 05:48.542
Fuck you!

05:51.083 --> 05:52.917
No kidding.

05:58.834 --> 06:03.667
- ( phone chimes )
- Hey, what's up?

06:03.667 --> 06:07.291
I'm by the side
of the road in some random
part of upstate New York.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.291
- That's what's up.
- Wait, what?

06:09.291 --> 06:10.583
- Where's Fran?
- We broke up.

06:10.583 --> 06:13.083
Can you get a Zipcar
and come get me?

06:13.083 --> 06:14.917
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I want to hear all about
it later,

06:14.917 --> 06:17.625
but right now
we're recording
and our tour manager

06:17.625 --> 06:20.125
needs to get an entire
demo set to our gig.

06:20.125 --> 06:21.500
Marnie, what does
any of that even mean?

06:21.500 --> 06:23.000
Please just
come get me.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.667
I'm sorry, I can't.
I wish I could help.

06:24.667 --> 06:26.458
Why don't you
just call an Uber?

06:26.458 --> 06:29.417
No, I got kicked off the app
for having too low a rating.
You know that.

06:29.417 --> 06:33.291
Well, I would ask Desi
if one of his loser fake
artiste friends with a car

06:33.291 --> 06:35.291
wants to do it
for a little bit
of extra cash,

06:35.291 --> 06:38.375
but he isn't talking
to me right now because
he's a child.

06:38.375 --> 06:44.959
♪ Boysenberries
on my bush... ♪

06:44.959 --> 06:47.667
The only time he looks
at me when we're together
is when we're singing.

06:47.667 --> 06:50.792
Why don't you ask Ray?
Didn't he just get, like,
a truck or something?

06:50.792 --> 06:52.959
The last thing I need
is a lecture from Ray

06:52.959 --> 06:54.834
about my, like,
lifestyle choices, okay?

06:54.834 --> 06:56.667
Just good luck
with your hit album.

06:56.667 --> 07:01.333
- Okay, I love you,
I'm so--

Jessa's voice:
You've reached Jessa.
If this is an emergency,

07:12.959 --> 07:14.792
you should hang up
and dial 9-1-1.

07:14.792 --> 07:16.834
I really don't listen
to my messages.

07:18.208 --> 07:20.500
Go fuck yourself.

07:22.208 --> 07:24.458
Laird:
Let's see who's
coming to see us.

07:24.458 --> 07:26.291
Let's see who's
coming to see us.

07:26.291 --> 07:28.041
Oh, hey, Tall Adam.
What are you doing here?

07:28.041 --> 07:29.375
I've been calling
Caroline a bunch

07:29.375 --> 07:30.834
and she hasn't
called me back.

07:30.834 --> 07:32.375
Just want to make sure
everything's okay.

07:32.375 --> 07:35.000
That is
very cool of you, man.
Very cool of you.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.875
But we're all good here.
We're all good here, right?

07:37.875 --> 07:41.000
Just plucking away,
keeping little Sample alive.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.917
You sticking with
the nickname Sample, huh?

07:43.917 --> 07:46.750
Oh, yeah.
I mean, she is
sample-sized, right?

07:46.750 --> 07:49.291
Sometimes I call her Samps.
Pete Sampras.

07:49.291 --> 07:50.625
Where's Caroline?

07:50.625 --> 07:53.041
That would be the question
of the day, my man.

07:53.041 --> 07:54.667
That is the question
of the day.

07:54.667 --> 07:57.333
She went out three days ago
to get some papitas,

07:57.333 --> 07:59.708
and I guess she's
still looking for them.

07:59.708 --> 08:01.333
What?

08:01.333 --> 08:03.750
Papitas, those toasted
pumpkin seeds?

08:03.750 --> 08:06.375
- Kind of a Mexican--
- No, no, no, no, no.
She's been gone three days?

08:06.375 --> 08:09.291
Yeah, yeah.
I've been, you know,
starting to wonder

08:09.291 --> 08:11.083
if I should get worried,
but I think she's fine.

08:11.083 --> 08:13.667
Yes, Laird,
you should be worried.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.583
Where the fuck
could she have gone?

08:15.583 --> 08:17.250
Hard to say, right?

08:17.250 --> 08:19.041
Oh, here comes
Uncle Adam.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.041
He's coming

to get up here.

08:43.750 --> 08:46.583
Put a lot of unnecessary
miles on this baby.

08:46.583 --> 08:48.166
Hannah:
Thank you so much, Ray.

08:48.166 --> 08:49.500
Well, what am I gonna do,

08:49.500 --> 08:52.291
let you rot out here
like a piece of fruit?

08:52.291 --> 08:54.375
Plus, I know how much
you hate being outdoors.

08:54.375 --> 08:57.750
Ray, you're the truest
and most loving friend
I've ever had.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.834
Okay, that's sad.

08:59.834 --> 09:02.375
You think I made a mistake
breaking up with Fran?

09:02.375 --> 09:06.750
Listen, Hannah, if you have
the impulse to run away
in your pajamas,

09:06.750 --> 09:08.792
that's a pretty strong indicator
that it's not working out.

09:08.792 --> 09:12.583
You gotta respect
your instincts, you know?
Trust your gut.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.917
You know?

09:24.667 --> 09:26.417
What-- what
are you doing?

09:26.417 --> 09:28.125
I'm just trying
to give you something

09:28.125 --> 09:31.250
to say thank you
for how kind you've
been to me.

09:31.250 --> 09:34.917
- Hannah, you really
don't have to, uh--
- It's okay. Just relax, okay?

09:34.917 --> 09:36.291
Yeah, but you
don't have to--

09:36.291 --> 09:38.917
- ( sucking )
- Oh, Jesus.

09:38.917 --> 09:43.792
Okay, um... uh,
I don't think this is
good for our friendship.

09:43.792 --> 09:47.667
Ray, I just need you
to relax and "enjoi"
the journey.

09:47.667 --> 09:51.083
Right, maybe we can
just talk about this
for a second.

09:51.083 --> 09:54.208
I don't want to talk
because I've got a dick
in my mouth.

09:54.208 --> 09:55.667
( muffled )
I just need you to relax

09:55.667 --> 09:57.500
and try to be present
in the moment.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.125
Okay, I'm trying
to relax.

09:59.125 --> 10:01.583
( muffled )
And you just tell me
what you like

10:01.583 --> 10:03.000
and just let me
do it to you.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.708
Is this-- is this okay?

10:04.708 --> 10:07.000
Don't touch
the top of my head.
I really don't like that.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.041
That's very
triggering for me.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.708
Just try
mixing it up
down there.

10:10.708 --> 10:12.917
- ( muffled ) Okay.
- Different energy
or something.

10:12.917 --> 10:14.500
Okay, that's...

10:24.333 --> 10:27.291
Ah!

10:27.291 --> 10:29.208
Fuck!

10:29.208 --> 10:31.959
What the fuck happened?

10:31.959 --> 10:34.250
( truck creaking )

10:34.250 --> 10:37.041
( both scream )

10:39.208 --> 10:42.000
Laird:
All right, here's the last
few websites she was on.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.041
Rihanna's
Oprah interview.

10:44.041 --> 10:47.125
Now, do you say "Riahna"
or do you say "Rianna"?

10:47.125 --> 10:49.166
If-- if-- "Riahna."

10:49.166 --> 10:50.875
"Riahna"?
That's what I say.

10:50.875 --> 10:52.959
A lot of people say "Rianna."
I think they're wrong.

10:52.959 --> 10:54.875
Joey Pepperoni menu.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.041
Wesley Snipes'
Wikipedia page.

10:57.041 --> 11:01.000
There's not, like, a place
that you guys leave little--
little notes for each other?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.250
What, like the fridge?

11:03.250 --> 11:05.834
Yeah, like the fridge.

11:05.834 --> 11:09.250
Hey, man, you ever see
"Passenger 57"?

11:09.250 --> 11:11.667
Isn't that awesome?
It was funny, man.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.667
"Always bet on black," man.
That's cool.

11:13.667 --> 11:16.875
That's a cool dude, man.
You ever see "Demolition Man"?

11:16.875 --> 11:19.917
I had a haircut like that onc.
It was pretty sweet.

11:19.917 --> 11:21.708
Hey, man! Hey!

11:21.708 --> 11:24.083
Just be cool
with my fridge, dude!

11:25.917 --> 11:28.250
There's a note
under your fridge.

11:28.250 --> 11:33.583
Oh, yeah, that's--
that's where my Wailers
tickets ended up.

11:33.583 --> 11:36.875
"Dearest Mouse."
I'm Mouse.

11:37.625 --> 11:40.083
"It is with
a heavy heart...

11:41.083 --> 11:43.792
and tortured soul

11:43.792 --> 11:47.250
that I write these words.

11:47.250 --> 11:50.250
Since the birth of Sample,

11:50.250 --> 11:53.792
which was and still remains
my greatest achievement,

11:53.792 --> 11:58.166
I've been racked with
inexplicable guilt and shame.

11:58.166 --> 12:02.750
My mind has been infected
by horrendous thoughts,

12:02.750 --> 12:04.792
a desire...

12:06.625 --> 12:11.125
to hurt
little Sample...

12:13.959 --> 12:17.458
and in my darkest
moments, myself."

12:21.792 --> 12:24.667
( exhales )

12:24.667 --> 12:29.125
"The best thing for everyone
is for me to leave.

12:29.125 --> 12:33.875
This is the most
anguishing thing I will
ever be forced to do.

12:33.875 --> 12:39.166
Be as kind to our daughter
as I was cruel to you

12:39.166 --> 12:42.583
and she will have
a wonderful life.

12:42.583 --> 12:44.667
Love, Caroline."

12:46.750 --> 12:49.000
( sighs )

12:51.041 --> 12:53.542
Oh, man.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.875
Would you watch
Sample for a bit?

12:57.875 --> 13:00.333
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, sure, yeah.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.834
( Sample babbles )

13:15.500 --> 13:18.708
Hannah:
Fuck, Ray, ah.

13:18.708 --> 13:20.750
Ah!

13:26.041 --> 13:27.875
( grunts )

13:37.458 --> 13:39.542
Fuck, Ray.

13:39.542 --> 13:41.041
What happened?

13:41.041 --> 13:43.125
- Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?

13:43.125 --> 13:44.625
I think I'm okay.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.875
I don't think I have
any broken bones
or anything.

13:46.875 --> 13:48.625
What the fuck
was that?

13:48.625 --> 13:50.708
Well, you were driving
and then suddenly you
just swerved--

13:50.708 --> 13:52.333
No, what the fuck
were you doing?

13:52.333 --> 13:54.208
That?
I was trying to blow you.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.750
Why?

13:55.750 --> 13:58.083
Why? 'Cause I was trying
to give you what you want

13:58.083 --> 14:00.792
'cause I'm not
a selfish person.

14:00.792 --> 14:02.750
This is a brand-new
coffee truck.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.250
Brand-new.
Do you have any idea

14:04.250 --> 14:05.834
how much a brand-new
coffee truck costs?

14:05.834 --> 14:08.083
$600?

14:09.500 --> 14:12.083
You are callow,
you are insufferable,

14:12.083 --> 14:14.000
and you have really
fucked me this time!

14:14.000 --> 14:15.458
Thank you very much.

14:15.458 --> 14:18.250
Are you mad 'cause
you couldn't get hard?

14:18.250 --> 14:20.208
$50,000.

14:20.208 --> 14:22.333
That's how much a brand-new
coffee truck costs.

14:22.333 --> 14:23.917
50K.

14:23.917 --> 14:27.000
And I can get hard
whenever the fuck I
want to get hard.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Okay, great, so you just
didn't want to get hard.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.250
Like most men, you had
no desire to get hard.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.792
Okay, let's call
Marnie Michaels, 'cause
clearly you don't believe me.

14:33.792 --> 14:36.500
- Put her on speakerphone.
- I don't want to call Marnie
and ask if you can get hard.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.792
- Shoshanna Shapiro?
- I don't want to talk
to anyone else.

14:38.792 --> 14:40.458
- Emily Goldstein.
- I don't want to talk--

14:40.458 --> 14:41.792
Susan Farber.
Ask anybody.

14:41.792 --> 14:43.583
I believe it.
You can get so hard.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.291
There we go.

14:46.291 --> 14:47.583

Okay, we're good.

15:05.125 --> 15:07.291
Okay, I couldn't get formula.
I went to two places.

15:07.291 --> 15:09.083
They didn't have it,
so I just got whole milk.

15:09.083 --> 15:11.625
No, no, no, no.
She can't drink that shit.

15:11.625 --> 15:14.625
It's a baby.
She's not gonna know
the difference, Adam.

15:14.625 --> 15:17.083
It doesn't matter
if she knows the difference.
She can't digest it.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.834
I know that.
I was kidding.

15:20.834 --> 15:22.417
I'm going out
to get formula now.

15:22.417 --> 15:24.667
I just came back
to see if you needed
anything else.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.125
No, just food.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.458
Just food for the baby
would be great.

15:28.458 --> 15:31.875
Oh, my God.
It is so hot.

15:31.875 --> 15:34.542
Have you
been out today?

15:34.542 --> 15:36.041
I'm going.

15:36.041 --> 15:38.041
I'm going.
I need a second.
I just got in.

15:38.041 --> 15:40.333
- It's so hot outside.
- Here, could you take her
for a second?

15:40.333 --> 15:42.834
I've had to pee for
the past hour and I don't
want to do it in front of her.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.166
She'll think
my dick's a monster.

15:44.166 --> 15:45.750
- I've never held a baby.
- ( crying )

15:45.750 --> 15:49.417
I've never held a baby.
Shh.

15:49.417 --> 15:54.000
Adam, how about
I hold your penis
while you hold the baby?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.041
( music playing )

15:56.041 --> 15:57.667
Scott:
...no point in going
to Croatia

15:57.667 --> 15:59.583
unless you have
a sick boat the entire time.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.834
You can cruise
around the islands.

16:01.834 --> 16:04.333
What? Shit.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.000
Shoshanna.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.875
Um, can you just
give us a sec?

16:08.875 --> 16:10.083
Sure.

16:10.083 --> 16:12.708
Great seeing you,
Shosh!

16:14.959 --> 16:16.083
Hi.

16:16.083 --> 16:18.291
Hey, Scott.
Um...

16:18.291 --> 16:20.333
what are you--
what are you doing here?

16:20.333 --> 16:23.291
Remember, this is
my little place that I--

16:23.291 --> 16:25.333
I told you
about this place.

16:25.333 --> 16:27.542
What-- um, why
aren't you in Japan?

16:27.542 --> 16:30.583
Um, I learned
that it's very hard
to emigrate,

16:30.583 --> 16:33.708
which is why you rarely
hear the word "emigrant."

16:33.708 --> 16:35.000
Oh.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.291
And were you
gonna call me, or...

16:37.291 --> 16:40.875
I don't know.

16:43.041 --> 16:45.500
Okay, so, um,
what's going on with you?

16:45.500 --> 16:47.417
What's-- what are you
doing for work?

16:47.417 --> 16:49.166
Um, I don't know, Scott.
I kind of just got back

16:49.166 --> 16:51.792
and all these questions
are, like, seriously
stressing me out,

16:51.792 --> 16:53.750
and I'm currently reading
about how to get on welfare,

16:53.750 --> 16:55.250
so I don't really
have time for this.

16:55.250 --> 16:56.917
You're going on welfare?

16:56.917 --> 16:58.458
I don't know.
I'm thinking about it, okay?

16:58.458 --> 17:00.250
There aren't exactly,
like, a wealth of options

17:00.250 --> 17:02.625
for an NYU graduate with
experience in many aspects

17:02.625 --> 17:04.083
of brand management.

17:04.083 --> 17:07.583
( scoffs )
You can't just take
government resources

17:07.583 --> 17:09.791
that are for actually
needy families

17:09.791 --> 17:12.416
just because you didn't
like your job in Japan.

17:12.416 --> 17:15.165
Okay, so now I don't
deserve food stamps
because I'm Jewish.

17:15.165 --> 17:17.750
You know what?
I'm-- I'm--

17:17.750 --> 17:21.083
I'm glad I saw you.
This is making me really
happy that we broke up.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.083
- Oh.
- Yeah, thank you
for doing that.

17:23.083 --> 17:26.458
- Yeah.
- You complained the entire
time we were together

17:26.458 --> 17:28.917
about all of your
unemployed, entitled friends,

17:28.917 --> 17:31.917
and you're actually
the worst of all of them.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.542
How dare you, Scott?

17:33.542 --> 17:35.125
You just preyed upon
my deepest fear.

17:35.125 --> 17:37.750
I told you that
in confidence during
pillow talk.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.667
Look, you're figuring out
how to go on welfare

17:39.667 --> 17:40.959
over omakase sushi.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.458
Maybe you should cut down
on your large-sake-

17:42.458 --> 17:44.458
in-the-middle-of-the-day
budget first.

17:44.458 --> 17:46.708
- That's a small.
- That is not a small,
that's a large.

17:46.708 --> 17:49.708
I know-- I know
what a large sake is.
I drink a lot of sake.

17:49.708 --> 17:51.792
That's why you have
a sake gut.

17:51.792 --> 17:54.458
You know what?
Have a great life.

17:54.458 --> 17:56.125
I hope everything
works out for you.

17:56.125 --> 17:58.792
- Good luck, Shosh.
- Oh, no, no. Don't you
"good luck" me.

17:58.792 --> 18:01.125
That is, like,
the meanest thing that you
could ever say to anybody.

18:01.125 --> 18:02.959
And by the way,
you're wrong about
this place.

18:02.959 --> 18:05.333
The fish is exactly
suited to the price.

18:05.333 --> 18:08.667
Well, and thank God
you can afford it with
your food stamps.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.834
( door opens )

18:10.834 --> 18:14.542
( speaking in Japanese )

18:17.959 --> 18:22.125
( speaking in Russian )

18:22.125 --> 18:25.166
Uh-huh, bye-bye.
Okay.

18:25.166 --> 18:26.959
All right, so my guy
won't be able to be here

18:26.959 --> 18:28.834
for another
four or five hours.

18:28.834 --> 18:30.625
So, call someone else.

18:30.625 --> 18:33.333
Why, so some stranger
could come here
and rip me off?

18:33.333 --> 18:35.166
No, thanks.
Dmitri's a good guy.

18:35.166 --> 18:37.834
He's on his way.
He's gonna do the job right.

18:37.834 --> 18:40.333
Well, what are we
gonna do?

18:40.333 --> 18:43.792
We can't just sit here
for four or five hours, Ray.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.083
- Shh.
- ( ringtone playing )

18:49.291 --> 18:51.083
Jessa, can you turn
that shit off?

18:51.083 --> 18:53.750
Yep. Shit.

18:59.750 --> 19:01.375
Hi, Hannah.
How's it going?

19:01.375 --> 19:04.875
Um, it's not good.
Why are you whispering?

19:04.875 --> 19:07.917
Um, because
I'm holding a baby.

19:07.917 --> 19:10.750
Whose baby
are you holding?

19:12.166 --> 19:14.250
It's Caroline's baby.

19:15.250 --> 19:17.917
Are you, uh, with Adam?

19:17.917 --> 19:19.750
Mm-hmm.

19:19.750 --> 19:22.750
I'm helping him
with the baby.

19:24.166 --> 19:26.458
Because
you're fucking him.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.750
Yeah.

19:33.625 --> 19:35.583
She knows.
She fully knows.

19:35.583 --> 19:37.792
I can't really think
about this right now.

19:37.792 --> 19:40.458
No, I know.
Let's never talk
about this, ever.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.250
Ever.
I mean...

19:42.250 --> 19:43.917
it's not like we did
anything wrong.

19:43.917 --> 19:46.000
You know, it's--
this is how you
meet people.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.583
You meet people
you know.

19:47.583 --> 19:49.792
It's not like
you guys were married.

19:49.792 --> 19:52.667
If I did something immoral,
I would feel bad.

19:52.667 --> 19:55.834
I-- but I don't because
we didn't do anything wrong.

19:55.834 --> 19:58.583
I mean,
do you feel bad?

19:58.583 --> 20:00.750
Jessa, my sister is missing.

20:00.750 --> 20:03.458
She abandoned her child
and appears to be suicidal.

20:03.458 --> 20:05.125
I can't really think
about Hannah right now.

20:05.125 --> 20:07.458
I know. That's why
it's so infuriating

20:07.458 --> 20:09.917
that she makes it
all about her.

20:09.917 --> 20:12.291
( birds chirping )

20:12.291 --> 20:13.959
Hey, you guys
all right?

20:13.959 --> 20:16.166
Yeah, we're okay.
Help's on the way.
Thank you.

20:16.166 --> 20:20.250
Actually, um, are you
by any chance going
into the city?

20:20.250 --> 20:22.834
- Yeah, I am.
- Would you mind
giving me a ride?

20:22.834 --> 20:25.250
I'm going to Greenpoint,
but any part of Brooklyn
will work.

20:26.583 --> 20:28.417
- Thank God.
- Hey, Hannah!

20:28.417 --> 20:30.125
Hannah,
what are you doing?

20:30.125 --> 20:32.792
This isn't 1974.
You can't just hop
into a car

20:32.792 --> 20:33.959
with a groovy stranger.

20:33.959 --> 20:35.625
I need to get home, Ray.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.750
Hannah, I forbid you
from leaving in this vehicle.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.750
- ( car door closes )
- Dude, she's an adult
woman, man.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.000
Let her do
what she wants.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.500
Hey, hey!
I got your plates!

20:44.500 --> 20:45.875
You put a hand on her,

20:45.875 --> 20:49.125
I will hunt you down

not take five.

21:22.041 --> 21:24.208
Hey, let's take five.
Take five.

21:24.208 --> 21:26.834
Yes, you made it.

21:26.834 --> 21:28.792
Of course.
I'm a woman of my word.

21:28.792 --> 21:30.375
Amazing.

21:30.375 --> 21:32.500
- Hi.
- Hey.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.708
Who are you?

21:34.708 --> 21:37.875
Oh, hey, guys,
this is Tandace.

21:37.875 --> 21:39.708
We are super lucky.
She's gonna help us out

21:39.708 --> 21:41.333
with our stage decor
on our tour.

21:41.333 --> 21:44.583
Tandace:
Pilar made some arepas.
I brought you some.

21:44.583 --> 21:48.500
Corazón, muchas gracias.
( sniffs )

21:48.500 --> 21:51.417
Que bien huelen.

21:51.417 --> 21:52.750
Me haces loco.

21:52.750 --> 21:54.166
Wait a minute.
Is this for real?

21:54.166 --> 21:56.000
Are you guys, like,
pranking me or something?

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
Desi, she cannot do
our, like, stage decor.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.208
- See what I mean?
- I got this.

22:01.208 --> 22:03.208
- Marnie?
- Yeah?

22:03.208 --> 22:04.417
Can we go solo a second?

22:04.417 --> 22:06.875
Yeah.

22:10.333 --> 22:12.625
- Who are you?
- I'm Tandace Moncrief.

22:12.625 --> 22:14.542
Yes, I am familiar
with your very fake name.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.542
I just mean how do you
know my whatever the fuck
he is to me now?

22:17.542 --> 22:20.583
I guess at this point
he's so close to being
my ex-husband.

22:20.583 --> 22:23.333
Desi and I
have known each other
for a long, long time.

22:23.333 --> 22:25.625
Oh, that's so interesting
'cause he's never
mentioned you

22:25.625 --> 22:27.083
and you also weren't
at our wedding.

22:27.083 --> 22:29.417
No, no, I wasn't.

22:29.417 --> 22:32.750
Actually, I was
facilitating an antiviolence
communication workshop...

22:32.750 --> 22:35.458
- Of course.
- ...making me
uniquely qualified

22:35.458 --> 22:38.375
to handle this situation.

22:38.375 --> 22:40.458
Desi tells me
you got some rage stuff.

22:40.458 --> 22:44.000
"Rage stuff."
"Rage stuff"? Really?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.792
"Rage"?
No, no, no, no.

22:45.792 --> 22:47.125
You have that
all fucking wrong.

22:47.125 --> 22:49.875
I am cool as a fucking
cucumber all the time.

22:49.875 --> 22:51.291
- Marnie?
- Yeah?

22:51.291 --> 22:53.375
Listen, right now
it's easier for Desi

22:53.375 --> 22:55.917
to separate the music
and his personal life.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.542
Obviously, you're
a major part of the music.

22:58.542 --> 23:03.083
But for his life,
we feel...

23:03.083 --> 23:07.333
that it would just
be better if you didn't
exist for a little while.

23:07.333 --> 23:09.834
Oh, interesting.
Okay, so I think
I understand now.

23:09.834 --> 23:12.542
When we're singing
and playing and making music,
he can talk to me

23:12.542 --> 23:14.458
and tell me what I'm doing
wrong and pick at me.

23:14.458 --> 23:17.959
That's all cool.
But the minute we stop,
I cease to exist.

23:17.959 --> 23:20.166
I become,
essentially, a ghost.

23:20.166 --> 23:23.000
- Exactly.
- Tandace: Exactly.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.166
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, well, Tandace,
I so accept your apology.

23:27.166 --> 23:30.542
And thank you so much
for all of your spiritual
guidance.

23:30.542 --> 23:33.417
Thank you,
and nama-fucking-ste.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.250
Was that your dad
back there?

23:40.250 --> 23:42.250
Are you guys in, like,
a fight or something?

23:42.250 --> 23:45.834
Oh, no, no, no.
That's just my old boss.

23:45.834 --> 23:48.792
You got a lot of stuff
in the c-car.

23:48.792 --> 23:50.208
Yeah, I'm moving.

23:52.834 --> 23:57.333
Okay, um, I'm actually
just receiving a call,
if you'll hold on one moment.

23:57.333 --> 23:59.166
Excuse me.

24:03.834 --> 24:05.792
Marnie, what's up?
Why you calling?

24:05.792 --> 24:09.625
You called me.
And I still can't
pick you up, Hannah.

24:09.625 --> 24:11.792
By the way, do you think
I have a rage problem?

24:11.792 --> 24:14.333
So, I'm hitchhiking,
actually.

24:14.333 --> 24:17.583
I got in a car
that pulled over for me
at the side of the road,

24:17.583 --> 24:19.792
so I am in Hector--

24:19.792 --> 24:21.917
I'm sorry, I didn't
catch your last name.

24:21.917 --> 24:24.208
Medina.

24:24.208 --> 24:26.041
Hector Medina's car.

24:26.041 --> 24:30.333
He is a Latin male
in his mid-30s.

24:30.333 --> 24:31.792
Close-cropped hair.

24:31.792 --> 24:33.708
Wait a minute, Hannah,
is this a safety call?

24:33.708 --> 24:35.375
Mm-hmm.

24:35.375 --> 24:37.166
Oh, my God.
Okay, you are not safe.

24:37.166 --> 24:39.041
Otherwise you would not be
making a safety call.

24:39.041 --> 24:42.542
So, what you need to do
is get out of the car
immediately.

24:42.542 --> 24:43.875
Yep, yep, yep.

24:43.875 --> 24:45.125
Oh, I'm sorry,

24:45.125 --> 24:46.959
but I picked you up
for company

24:46.959 --> 24:48.625
and it's just kind of rude
that you're on the phone.

24:48.625 --> 24:50.125
Sorry, my friend's just...

24:50.125 --> 24:52.500
Marnie, I gotta go.
Can't do this now.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.375
Okay, okay, Hannah.
Just pretend to hang up

24:54.375 --> 24:56.458
but leave me on the phone
so that I can hear you,

24:56.458 --> 24:57.875
and then the first
chance you get,

24:57.875 --> 24:59.625
tell him you have
to pee and then run.

24:59.625 --> 25:02.041
Yes.

25:02.041 --> 25:04.000
You know, I actually
have to pee really bad,

25:04.000 --> 25:05.917
so wherever
you can pull over.

25:05.917 --> 25:08.125
There's nowhere really
to stop around here.

25:08.125 --> 25:09.750
Okay, but I've
gotta pee, like, now,

25:09.750 --> 25:11.041
so whenever
you can pull it over,

25:11.041 --> 25:12.583
I will literally
pee anywhere.

25:12.583 --> 25:13.917
Right here would
actually be great.

25:13.917 --> 25:15.917
- Here.
- At this exact spot.

25:16.917 --> 25:19.041
I don't think
I can, uh...

25:19.041 --> 25:21.542
I won't look, okay?
I promise.

25:23.250 --> 25:24.750
What, you don't
trust me?

25:24.750 --> 25:27.208
You get in my car
and you don't trust me?

25:27.208 --> 25:28.333
- I trust you!
- Wow.

25:28.333 --> 25:30.750
I trust you.
I trust you.

25:30.750 --> 25:32.333
In fact, you and I
trust each other

25:32.333 --> 25:34.542
and I am peeing
in this bottle because
I have to pee,

25:34.542 --> 25:37.083
but also to show that you
and I do trust each other

25:37.083 --> 25:40.291
and we would never
do anything to harm
one another.

25:40.291 --> 25:42.417
Okay.

25:44.583 --> 25:46.333
Okay.

25:46.333 --> 25:50.000
Marnie's voice:
Hannah, are you seriously
about to pee right now?

25:50.000 --> 25:51.750
( crying )

25:51.750 --> 25:54.375
( humming )

25:54.375 --> 25:55.917
- ( vomits )
- ( gasps ) Oh, gosh.

25:55.917 --> 25:58.750
- ( crying )
- Oh, my Lord.
Oh, Lord.

25:58.750 --> 26:01.750
I think-- Adam, I think
she just spit up on me.

26:01.750 --> 26:04.625
You need to hold her.
Just-- please.

26:04.625 --> 26:07.542
Wait, look, did she--
oh, my God, it stinks.

26:07.542 --> 26:09.375
Oh, my God, Adam.

26:09.375 --> 26:11.125
Wait, where are
the towels?

26:11.125 --> 26:13.834
You have to help me.
It's dripping all the way
down my back

26:13.834 --> 26:16.166
and into my butt.
Adam.

26:17.625 --> 26:19.166
Why aren't you
helping me?

26:19.166 --> 26:23.125
You're an adult.
She's a baby.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.834
Why do you need
more help than a baby?

26:28.417 --> 26:29.959
( scoffs )

26:32.166 --> 26:33.959
So, why are you moving?

26:33.959 --> 26:36.667
Well, it's-- it's kind
of a long story.

26:36.667 --> 26:38.917
I was in a pretty
fucked-up relationship

26:38.917 --> 26:40.792
and I just had
to get out.

26:40.792 --> 26:42.834
It's complicated.

26:42.834 --> 26:45.875
You know, the relationship
just got too intense.

26:45.875 --> 26:48.667
Things became abusive.

26:51.250 --> 26:52.500
Did you hit her?

26:52.500 --> 26:54.166
No, no, no, no.
I couldn't do that.

26:54.166 --> 26:56.375
I wouldn't.
That's what was
so fucked up.

26:56.375 --> 26:58.959
There was nothing
I could do when she would
beat the shit out of me.

26:58.959 --> 27:00.792
She hit you?

27:00.792 --> 27:02.083
Oh, my God.
All the time.

27:02.083 --> 27:04.917
She would fuckin'
hit me with lamps,

27:04.917 --> 27:07.083
- kick me in the balls.
- Oh, God.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.708
Slap me with magazines.

27:08.708 --> 27:12.708
The last straw was when
she pointed a fucking gun
in my face.

27:12.708 --> 27:16.333
I wrestled that shit
out of her hands and
I packed my bags.

27:16.333 --> 27:20.333
Now I'm getting
as far the fuck away
from Nevada as I can.

27:20.333 --> 27:22.083
Yeah, totally.

27:22.083 --> 27:23.875
You and I are two peas
in a pod, my friend,

27:23.875 --> 27:25.625
'cause I just broke up
with my boyfriend.

27:25.625 --> 27:28.000
That's how I ended up
like trash by the side
of the road.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.333
Oh, shit.
No way.

27:30.333 --> 27:31.917
Why'd you break up?

27:31.917 --> 27:34.750
Oh, um, you know,
he turned out to be a dick.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.458
Mm-hmm.

27:36.458 --> 27:38.291
I guess what I'm
even more upset about
than the breakup

27:38.291 --> 27:40.458
is the fact that I just
got official confirmation

27:40.458 --> 27:43.834
that my ex-boyfriend
and my now ex-best friend
are fucking.

27:43.834 --> 27:45.333
Oh, shit.
What?

27:45.333 --> 27:48.125
Dude, they could've found
somebody else, right?

27:48.125 --> 27:50.917
I mean, what's he got,
like, a diamond dick?

27:50.917 --> 27:53.917
She have a golden pussy
or something?

27:53.917 --> 27:57.750
- They might have
those things.
- ( scoffs )

27:57.750 --> 27:59.625
But...

27:59.625 --> 28:01.208
Oh, damn.

28:01.208 --> 28:02.834
There it is.

28:02.834 --> 28:05.542
I've never seen the city
in real life before.

28:05.542 --> 28:07.417
Hannah:
Well, there it is.

28:07.417 --> 28:09.458
Whoo!

28:09.458 --> 28:12.708
Yes, you made it
to New York City, baby!

28:12.708 --> 28:14.458
You're really excited!

28:14.458 --> 28:16.417
It's like,
it's New York, right?

28:16.417 --> 28:18.792
It feels like anything
is possible there.

28:18.792 --> 28:20.583
I'm gonna
go see Les Mis!

28:20.583 --> 28:22.417
- Yeah!
- I'm gonna get
my portrait done,

28:22.417 --> 28:24.083
but I want to do
the profile, you know?

28:24.083 --> 28:26.542
Like, nobody ever
does their profile,
so I wanna do that.

28:26.542 --> 28:28.125
( Hector laughs )

28:28.125 --> 28:29.917
Well, you're gonna like it.
It's a good place to live.

28:29.917 --> 28:32.000
There's a lot
of different kinds
of food, good pizza.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
It's a good place
to start over.

28:37.458 --> 28:39.917
Yeah.
