Most Alphas would've
opted to see me fail,

13:27.604 --> 13:31.073
then staked a claim to my
territory in North America.

13:34.310 --> 13:37.580
The way he sat there in your chair.

13:37.614 --> 13:41.584
Roman Navikev never turns down
a chance to show disrespect.

13:41.618 --> 13:44.352
No.

13:44.387 --> 13:45.954
Not like your father.

13:45.988 --> 13:48.156
There was an Alpha who
ruled with his heart,

13:48.191 --> 13:49.291
not his fist.

13:57.266 --> 13:59.834
What will you do if you
don't find Malcolm?

13:59.868 --> 14:02.604
He could slip away
with the pregnant woman.

14:06.609 --> 14:08.509
He could.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.478
He hasn't had any money to speak of

14:10.512 --> 14:12.914
since I closed his
account a few years ago,

14:12.948 --> 14:14.882
yet he managed an uprising.

14:14.917 --> 14:16.718
You think someone is backing him?

14:18.686 --> 14:22.556
Treachery is easier to
hide from across an ocean.

14:22.591 --> 14:23.890
And it does seem to be someone

14:23.925 --> 14:25.493
who is hungry for North America.

14:27.629 --> 14:30.197
Navikev.

14:30.232 --> 14:31.432
You are clever.

14:31.466 --> 14:33.434
He underestimated you.

14:33.468 --> 14:35.401
You will need proof.

14:35.436 --> 14:37.104
Follow the money.

14:37.138 --> 14:39.906
If I find that Roman was involved,

14:39.941 --> 14:44.244
do I have your support in killing him?

14:44.278 --> 14:46.246
My support?

14:46.280 --> 14:47.614
I swear to you

14:47.649 --> 14:49.482
on the blood of my infant son

14:49.517 --> 14:52.418
that I will personally
place his head on a stake

14:52.453 --> 14:54.387
beside Malcolm's.

14:54.421 --> 14:57.757
Wait at your hotel for word.

14:57.791 --> 15:01.561
We will finish this... together.

15:03.497 --> 15:04.797
Hm.

15:06.500 --> 15:07.800
Not much of a meet-up.

15:10.503 --> 15:12.138

15:17.914 --> 15:19.554

15:34.627 --> 15:35.727

Ohhhh...

15:35.761 --> 15:37.696
You got another stupid question?

15:37.730 --> 15:39.931
Elena: Malcolm. Spit it out.

15:39.965 --> 15:42.834
I don't know. You know as much as I do.

15:44.203 --> 15:47.305
I know your contact is Nate Parker.

15:47.339 --> 15:49.580

15:50.676 --> 15:53.044
(Bone cracking)
(Yelling)

15:53.079 --> 15:54.612
I also know you're meeting Mutts

15:54.646 --> 15:56.981
and taking them to Malcolm.

15:57.016 --> 15:58.249
Looks like no one's interested

15:58.283 --> 16:00.251
in joining your failed uprising.

16:00.285 --> 16:02.019
So tell us where he is

16:02.053 --> 16:03.721
and we'll put an end to this.

16:03.755 --> 16:06.090
If I talk, Malcolm kills me.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.528
- Ugh!
- Tell me what you know

16:10.562 --> 16:11.629
and I'll kill him.

16:11.663 --> 16:14.164
You'll never get to him.

16:14.199 --> 16:16.767

That was you?

16:24.675 --> 16:26.744
I thought it was Malcolm.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.212
Flight to France.

16:28.246 --> 16:29.579
He didn't make it on.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.248
It's 'cause I got to him first.

16:33.751 --> 16:36.018
Go on. Tell me what happened!

16:36.053 --> 16:38.421
Elena, don't, he's
goading you to kill him.

16:38.456 --> 16:39.723
He was scared.

16:39.757 --> 16:41.524
He was begging for his life.

16:41.559 --> 16:43.526
I took him to the warehouse.

16:43.561 --> 16:45.629
I never decapitated someone before.

27:24.203 --> 27:25.603

27:25.638 --> 27:27.773

him, to these Mutts,

27:27.807 --> 27:29.674

27:29.708 --> 27:32.677

29:26.321 --> 29:28.722

from Clay and Elena?

29:28.757 --> 29:30.457
It was carnage at the house.

29:30.492 --> 29:32.826
No sign of Malcolm or Rachel.

29:32.861 --> 29:35.162
This is no time to be
delicate with Alpha politics.

29:35.197 --> 29:37.331
They've given you a deadline, Jeremy.

29:37.366 --> 29:39.166
We'll give them Malcolm.
This is the way.

29:39.201 --> 29:40.434
Rodrigo Sanchez,

29:40.468 --> 29:43.704
may I present Nick Sorentino.

29:43.738 --> 29:46.106
Nick was in New York on business.

29:46.140 --> 29:48.375
He was tracking down Malcolm's accounts.

29:48.410 --> 29:49.777
Or rather the accounts

29:49.811 --> 29:51.278
of the alias that Malcolm was using,

29:51.312 --> 29:53.146
- James Williams.
- Hmm.

29:53.180 --> 29:56.383
You tell Rodrigo what you found, Nick.

29:56.418 --> 29:57.885
Well, we tracked the money.

29:57.919 --> 29:59.520
And we found out that
Malcolm was financed

29:59.553 --> 30:02.755
by a bank account that
originated in Russia.

30:02.790 --> 30:04.557
You have the proof you needed.

30:04.591 --> 30:06.793
Roman Navikev is backing Malcolm.

30:06.827 --> 30:09.262
He is the fish that is rotting
from head to tail.

30:09.297 --> 30:10.830
Jeremy: Yes.

30:10.864 --> 30:13.233
That was very convenient.

30:13.267 --> 30:17.570
Only, I know that Roman has
never met with my father.

30:17.604 --> 30:20.339
And you say that you haven't either.

30:20.373 --> 30:24.142
Yet you know the woman
he took was pregnant.

30:24.176 --> 30:26.411
I was very careful never
to reveal that fact.

30:28.414 --> 30:29.948
What do you smell, Nick?

30:29.982 --> 30:33.251
(Deep inhalation)

30:33.285 --> 30:35.086
Fear.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.355
That's why werewolves can
never play poker together.

30:37.389 --> 30:39.958
There are two ways
to be a traitor, Rodrigo.

30:41.994 --> 30:44.829
You can be a man and do it in the open,

30:44.863 --> 30:46.597
or you can be a weasel.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.868
And you, my friend...

30:50.902 --> 30:52.003
are a weasel.

30:54.149 --> 30:56.149
You financed Malcolm through
a Russian bank account

30:56.174 --> 30:57.975
so that I would blame
Roman if I went looking.

30:57.976 --> 31:02.145
Jeremy, this is a mistake. No!

31:02.180 --> 31:04.247
Because you wanted Malcolm
running things over here.

31:04.282 --> 31:05.449
If you want to live,

31:05.484 --> 31:06.884
you start talking right now.

31:06.918 --> 31:08.953
Where is Malcolm?

31:08.987 --> 31:10.053
Where is he?

31:10.088 --> 31:11.989
Malcolm called me an hour ago.

31:12.023 --> 31:15.392
He asked me to... to wire
$200,000 to Baton Rouge.

31:15.426 --> 31:17.995
Baton Rouge. Clay might know where he is.

31:18.029 --> 31:20.563
Rodrigo: Th-that's all I know, I swear!

31:20.598 --> 31:23.800
(Choking)
(Softly) Rodrigo,

31:23.834 --> 31:25.402
it would be a shame if I found out

31:25.436 --> 31:28.004
that you knew more
and you didn't tell us.

31:28.038 --> 31:30.840
Especially about the pregnant girl.

31:30.875 --> 31:34.143
Malcolm is flying to
Bangkok tomorrow night.

31:34.177 --> 31:36.479
What about the girl? That's
all I know about her,

31:36.514 --> 31:38.815
except that Malcolm had her.

31:38.849 --> 31:40.717
If he gets on that
flight, we've lost him.

31:42.052 --> 31:44.086
I could kill you right now, Rodrigo.

31:44.121 --> 31:45.354
Yeah?

31:45.389 --> 31:47.423
(Choking, straining)

31:47.457 --> 31:49.325

to give you a chance

31:49.359 --> 31:51.460

31:51.495 --> 31:53.595
Every Pack would stand against you

31:53.630 --> 31:56.032

you tried to frame Roman

31:56.066 --> 31:58.434
and steal my territory in North America.

32:00.537 --> 32:02.237
What would you have me do?

32:02.271 --> 32:05.674
You just stand by until I contact you.

32:08.578 --> 32:10.445
And trust me,

32:10.479 --> 32:13.481
if Roman ever found out
what you had done,

32:13.516 --> 32:17.118
he wouldn't kill your infant son,

32:17.153 --> 32:18.920
he would skin him alive.

Something came at me in Rochester.

40:29.083 --> 40:31.112
(Sighs)

40:32.491 --> 40:34.592
Is that what this is about?

40:34.615 --> 40:37.584
Malcolm: It was branded
on their necks that symbol.

40:37.665 --> 40:41.585
It was also on the necks of the people
who jumped us at the shipping yards.

40:43.579 --> 40:47.553
(Phone clicks)
Were they responsible for this too?

40:50.625 --> 40:53.103
I've scratched the surface of
what that means, Clay,

40:53.105 --> 40:55.161
and nothing good could come from it.

40:55.186 --> 40:59.032
You need to keep me alive
for what's coming.

40:59.884 --> 41:01.035
(Grunts)

41:04.407 --> 41:05.625
(Car door slams)

41:10.858 --> 41:13.196
I found this inside.

41:15.142 --> 41:17.393
- It's the same symbol.
- Yeah.

41:18.798 --> 41:21.362
I'm going to stay on. Look into it.

41:21.364 --> 41:23.430
A professor I know in Tulane
specializing in Pagan symbology.

41:23.432 --> 41:25.732
Yeah, but what if it's nothing?

41:25.734 --> 41:27.785
What if he's just messing with us?

41:27.815 --> 41:30.582
No... I saw something in Malcolm's eyes

41:30.595 --> 41:33.830
I've never seen before. Fear.

41:37.783 --> 41:42.215
- Do you want me to stay?
- No, I want you to be there

41:42.217 --> 41:45.852
when Jeremy kills him.
And before that, you don't let

41:45.854 --> 41:47.621
him get in your head.

41:49.021 --> 41:52.079
He can't get in my head if
he's separated from his.

41:52.101 --> 41:55.040
What now? We can't distract them all.

41:55.571 --> 41:58.531
Wherever they're taking
Malcolm Danvers...

41:58.533 --> 42:00.718
is where we are going.

42:03.328 --> 42:07.173
(Door creaks)
(Footsteps)

42:15.134 --> 42:16.148
(Door closes)

42:16.150 --> 42:19.218
(Footsteps)

42:19.220 --> 42:23.092
♪

42:27.094 --> 42:30.933
♪

42:42.278 --> 42:44.294
- Did you find the wolf?
- We did.

42:44.295 --> 42:46.255
We'll save you soon.

42:46.294 --> 42:48.294
Alastair came back angry.

42:48.652 --> 42:51.004
Did he do anything to you?

42:51.411 --> 42:55.105
No, it was about the wolf, not me.

42:57.430 --> 43:00.249
Savannah, listen, he
isn't what he seems.

43:00.250 --> 43:02.102
Wait, can you hear that?

43:04.770 --> 43:08.379
I don't hear anything.
What is it, Savannah?

43:08.917 --> 43:10.685
The screams.

43:16.468 --> 43:17.987
(Grunts)

43:18.192 --> 43:20.880
(Pants)

43:31.280 --> 43:34.873
