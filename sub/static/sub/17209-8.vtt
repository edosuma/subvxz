WEBVTT

00:04.038 --> 00:07.023
Two Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reinbeers.

00:07.024 --> 00:09.357
I don't write 'em, I just say 'em.

00:10.226 --> 00:11.761
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:11.762 --> 00:12.895
- Hey!
- Hey.

00:12.896 --> 00:15.964
I'm going to need these.

00:18.534 --> 00:21.970
Felix's mother is coming for Christmas.

00:23.205 --> 00:26.175
I thought Felix was built in
a government research facility.

00:26.176 --> 00:28.644
It's nice to have family
around for the holidays.

00:28.645 --> 00:30.880
That's because you
don't know his mother.

00:30.881 --> 00:33.149
She holds him to these
impossible standards

00:33.150 --> 00:35.584
and he drives himself crazy
trying to live up to them.

00:35.585 --> 00:37.168
I have noticed that whenever she calls,

00:37.169 --> 00:38.969
he starts dusting and ironing.

00:40.022 --> 00:41.157
Once at the same time.

00:41.158 --> 00:43.192
He's like a damn cartoon octopus.

00:45.662 --> 00:47.029
And let's just say

00:47.030 --> 00:49.765
she is not a member of
the Oscar Madison Fan Club.

00:49.766 --> 00:50.732
No one is.

00:50.733 --> 00:52.636
Remember there wasn't
enough interest to justify

00:52.637 --> 00:54.837
$7 a month for the website?

00:54.838 --> 00:56.338
Why doesn't Felix's mom like you?

00:56.339 --> 00:57.373
You're a delight.

00:57.374 --> 00:59.442
She thinks I'm a bad influence.

00:59.443 --> 01:01.376
That's why you're a delight.

01:02.344 --> 01:03.946
I was looking forward to Felix going

01:03.947 --> 01:05.714
to his mom's house for Christmas.

01:05.715 --> 01:06.949
That way I could celebrate

01:06.950 --> 01:09.417
my traditional "no pants" Christmas.

01:11.287 --> 01:14.256
See, you wake up early
on Christmas morning...

01:14.257 --> 01:16.125
And you don't wear pants.

01:16.126 --> 01:19.428
It's really the most
wonderful time of the year.

01:19.429 --> 01:24.433
Well, enjoying your Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reinbeers?

01:25.569 --> 01:26.734
I wrote that.

01:27.570 --> 01:28.971
Classic me.

01:28.972 --> 01:30.639
I see you got the place all decked out

01:30.640 --> 01:31.907
for your Christmas Eve party.

01:31.908 --> 01:33.229
Well, I hope you all can make it.

01:33.230 --> 01:34.693
We're going to have some great food.

01:34.694 --> 01:36.145
Not from here, of course.

01:36.146 --> 01:37.880
And I think I heard

01:37.881 --> 01:40.816
a rumor that a special
guest from the North Pole

01:40.817 --> 01:42.451
will be dropping in.

01:42.452 --> 01:44.587
It's a shame you always
happen to be out of the room

01:44.588 --> 01:45.988
whenever Santa drops by.

01:45.989 --> 01:47.623
I know.

01:47.624 --> 01:49.687
Maybe this year I'll be
lucky enough to finally meet

01:49.688 --> 01:51.921
that handsome devil.

01:53.395 --> 01:54.396
I love how he thinks

01:54.397 --> 01:55.531
he's fooling us.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.195
I mean, how gullible
does he think we are?

01:57.196 --> 01:58.934
Hey, did you guys hear?

01:58.935 --> 02:01.239
There's going to be a secret
guest at the Christmas party.

02:01.240 --> 02:03.540
I think it might be Santa!

02:04.840 --> 02:06.408
Hey, guys.

02:06.409 --> 02:08.112
Well, it looks like
Freddy's making me work

02:08.113 --> 02:09.245
the Christmas party.

02:09.246 --> 02:13.048
It will be the
time-and-a-half of my life.

02:13.049 --> 02:15.117
How come you got stuck
with it and not Maureen?

02:15.118 --> 02:16.981
Because I'm not the one
who keeps asking Freddy

02:16.982 --> 02:18.621
if he's been working out.

02:18.622 --> 02:20.088
Like a rock!

02:21.123 --> 02:22.591
You know what, though? It's good.

02:22.592 --> 02:23.759
It's good.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.995
I mean, my family's far away

02:25.996 --> 02:28.130
and I haven't been
invited anywhere else,

02:28.131 --> 02:29.999
so may as well make some extra money.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.334
You know, for a therapist.

02:33.870 --> 02:36.639
Oh, God, Felix's mom just landed.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.973
More reinbeers, Maureen.

02:40.075 --> 02:42.744
I'm going to need to get Blitzened.

02:44.246 --> 02:47.348
Subtitle sync and corrections by

02:54.156 --> 02:57.226
Ho, ho, no.

02:57.227 --> 03:00.196
Good tidings, fine sir, on
this Christmas Eve's eve.

03:00.197 --> 03:03.265
You think you made this
place Christmas-y enough?

03:03.266 --> 03:04.532
Not yet.

03:08.571 --> 03:12.174
There's only one place
I'm putting these antlers,

03:12.175 --> 03:14.509
and it will not make you jolly.

03:15.744 --> 03:17.646
Oh, get in the spirit, Oscar.

03:17.647 --> 03:19.470
Mother has entrusted me
with hosting Christmas

03:19.471 --> 03:22.318
for the very first time, and
she has set the bar very high.

03:22.319 --> 03:25.688
Take a look at this photo album
of the Ungers' Christmas past.

03:25.689 --> 03:27.309
You simply must see my mother's buche.

03:30.826 --> 03:32.727
I must not see that.

03:33.729 --> 03:35.764
It's a cake, Oscar... the buche de Noel,

03:35.765 --> 03:37.533
the centerpiece of
the Unger family table,

03:37.534 --> 03:39.637
and this year I have made
it for the very first time.

03:39.638 --> 03:40.804
Come and look!

03:43.005 --> 03:46.341
Okay, but only because it's
in the same direction as beer.

03:47.810 --> 03:48.844
And here it is.

03:48.845 --> 03:50.246
Mmm, chocolate.

03:50.247 --> 03:51.412
No touching!

03:53.522 --> 03:54.883
Please step out of sneezing range.

03:54.884 --> 03:56.252
How do I know how far...

03:56.253 --> 03:58.520
- There's tape on the floor.
- Okay.

03:58.521 --> 04:01.890
Every year my mother would
lock herself in the kitchen

04:01.891 --> 04:03.459
to create the perfect buche de Noel,

04:03.460 --> 04:04.893
and this year,

04:04.894 --> 04:07.129
after two sleepless nights
and one bracing rum toddy,

04:07.130 --> 04:10.532
I have finally made one
that is worthy of her.

04:10.533 --> 04:12.568
Felix, I know you want
to impress your mother,

04:12.569 --> 04:15.971
but you've got to dial down the crazy.

04:15.972 --> 04:17.805
She's here.

04:17.807 --> 04:19.440
Mother's here!

04:21.976 --> 04:24.612
He dialed it the wrong way.

04:25.447 --> 04:26.148
Mother!

04:26.149 --> 04:27.983
Fe-Fe!

04:27.984 --> 04:29.718
Oh!

04:29.719 --> 04:31.720
Thank you for hosting your old mother

04:31.721 --> 04:33.322
while her house is being remodeled.

04:33.323 --> 04:35.426
We're thrilled that you're
here. Welcome to our home.

04:35.427 --> 04:38.060
It looks lovely.

04:38.061 --> 04:41.295
I'm so glad you took it to heart
when I said not to make a fuss.

04:43.699 --> 04:45.067
Hello, Oscar.

04:45.068 --> 04:47.969
You don't look any worse
than the last time I saw you.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.139
Hello, Meredith.

04:50.140 --> 04:52.141
Oh, please, call me Mrs. Unger.

04:52.142 --> 04:55.377
What should I offer myself to drink?

04:55.378 --> 04:57.311
Shot of vodka? All right.

04:58.380 --> 05:00.115
I'm sorry that Randy is stuck in Vermont

05:00.116 --> 05:01.450
and won't be able to join us.

05:01.451 --> 05:04.153
Yes, unfortunately he had
to oversee the tile placement

05:04.154 --> 05:06.055
on our kitchen remodel.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.123
He's such a perfectionist.

05:08.124 --> 05:10.159
Randy is a general contractor
that my mother hired

05:10.160 --> 05:13.796
who then installed himself
in my mother's bedroom.

05:13.797 --> 05:17.232
Make it a double? All right.

05:17.233 --> 05:20.502
Felix, I wasn't expecting you
to make the Christmas village.

05:20.503 --> 05:23.405
No wonder you didn't
have time for a haircut.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.507
I know, look at me.

05:25.508 --> 05:27.809
I'm like one of the Grateful Deads.

05:28.777 --> 05:30.779
What's this?

05:30.780 --> 05:31.814
Open it.

05:31.815 --> 05:33.649
It wouldn't be Christmas
if I didn't make

05:33.650 --> 05:35.784
my famous buche de Noel.

05:35.785 --> 05:37.853
Hey, what a coincidence,

05:37.854 --> 05:38.987
Felix made...

05:38.988 --> 05:40.622
sure that there's
plenty of counter space

05:40.623 --> 05:42.790
in the kitchen for your masterpiece.

05:44.793 --> 05:47.830
Ah, perfect as usual.

05:47.831 --> 05:49.831
I will find a home
for it in the kitchen.

05:52.668 --> 05:55.270
So, small talk.

05:55.271 --> 05:56.405
No, thank you.

05:56.406 --> 05:57.572
All right.

06:04.179 --> 06:05.914
You okay?

06:05.915 --> 06:07.616
Hmm? Never better.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:19.561 --> 06:20.561
Uh...

06:21.930 --> 06:23.732
What are you doing to your cake?

06:23.733 --> 06:25.734
We don't need mine, do we?

06:25.735 --> 06:27.136
Mother made a better one.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.371
Now I just need to work harder
to show that I am capable

06:29.372 --> 06:30.915
of hosting the Unger family Christmas,

06:30.916 --> 06:32.441
so put on your antlers.

06:32.442 --> 06:33.275
Felix, you really...

06:33.276 --> 06:34.275
Antlers!

06:49.244 --> 06:52.580
He shoved a perfectly good
cake down the garbage disposal?

06:52.581 --> 06:54.415
I've never met Felix's mom.

06:54.416 --> 06:58.119
I've only seen that
picture of them at his prom.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.420
I feel so bad for him.

06:59.421 --> 07:02.457
She keeps knocking him
down and he keeps smiling.

07:02.458 --> 07:04.259
I've got this weird feeling.

07:04.260 --> 07:07.561
Like I... want to help him?

07:08.563 --> 07:09.831
What do you want to do?

07:09.832 --> 07:11.366
Well, just support him.

07:11.367 --> 07:13.868
When she knocks him down,
I'll lift him back up.

07:13.869 --> 07:16.371
I'll let him know that I'm on his side.

07:16.372 --> 07:18.038
You mean like be his friend?

07:19.240 --> 07:21.609
Oh, God, this is going to be horrible.

07:21.610 --> 07:23.111
Sorry, Oscar.

07:23.112 --> 07:24.712
Hey, why don't you guys come with me?

07:24.713 --> 07:26.247
It's going to be super fun.

07:26.248 --> 07:28.082
You just said it was
going to be horrible.

07:28.083 --> 07:29.951
Come on, guys, please?

07:29.952 --> 07:32.554
No, we're going to be down
here at the party, partying.

07:32.555 --> 07:34.155
But I need Unger buffers!

07:34.156 --> 07:36.090
They're going to try

07:36.091 --> 07:39.794
to pack every minute with fun
activities that aren't fun.

07:39.795 --> 07:40.962
How do you know?

07:40.963 --> 07:42.763
He gave me a program.

07:44.432 --> 07:45.800
Hi, guys.

07:45.801 --> 07:47.202
Emily,

07:47.203 --> 07:50.104
I hate the idea that you
have to work on Christmas Eve.

07:50.105 --> 07:52.340
Oh, Fred, thank you.

07:52.341 --> 07:54.609
Oh, I don't hate it enough
to give you the night off.

07:54.610 --> 07:57.545
But I got you something
that I think will make it

07:57.546 --> 07:59.714
a little more fun.

07:59.715 --> 08:01.282
Why be a waitress

08:01.283 --> 08:04.384
when you can be Santa's little helper?

08:05.987 --> 08:06.955
Huh?

08:06.956 --> 08:08.323
It's a rental,

08:08.324 --> 08:09.657
so take it off before you mop.

08:09.658 --> 08:12.994
I'm letting the cleaning
crew go home early.

08:12.995 --> 08:14.729
How thoughtful.

08:14.730 --> 08:16.430
Well, it's Christmas.

Bravo.

09:00.509 --> 09:02.543
Do we deserve the applause, Felix?

09:02.544 --> 09:04.912
Our harmonies were not
as good as last year.

09:04.913 --> 09:06.581
Were you singing from your diaphragm?

09:06.582 --> 09:08.750
I'm sure that I wasn't.

09:08.751 --> 09:10.051
Apologies, everyone.

09:10.052 --> 09:11.586
I rescind my bow.

09:11.587 --> 09:12.687
Encore!

09:12.688 --> 09:13.588
You know, encore!

09:13.589 --> 09:14.489
- No, no.
- Nope.

09:14.490 --> 09:16.323
She touched his butt.

09:18.693 --> 09:21.361
Well, if I may, I shall go
and prepare the mulled cider.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.899
I have been experimenting
this year with the addition

09:24.900 --> 09:26.567
of nutmeg.

09:26.568 --> 09:29.369
Sounds delicious, if
it were Thanksgiving.

09:30.605 --> 09:32.373
You're right.

09:32.374 --> 09:34.609
Nutmeg is a November spice.

09:34.610 --> 09:37.412
How foolish of me.

09:37.413 --> 09:39.280
Keep her busy.

09:39.281 --> 09:40.381
Please don't leave us.

09:40.382 --> 09:41.648
Ah!

09:42.650 --> 09:45.787
So, uh, what was Felix like as a boy?

09:45.788 --> 09:47.322
Very bright.

09:47.323 --> 09:49.857
He self-potty-trained at 13 months,

09:49.858 --> 09:53.193
and at 15 months learned
to clean that potty.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.565
Well, that's a corner
piece to the puzzle.

09:57.566 --> 10:01.250
They say there's a limit to how
long you should breastfeed...

10:01.251 --> 10:03.303
- Oh, God.
- Uh, ring, ring... I better get this.

10:04.372 --> 10:06.274
Hello? What?

10:06.275 --> 10:08.409
Cat in the tree? Which branch?

10:08.410 --> 10:10.410
The highest one? I'll be right there.

10:14.015 --> 10:15.450
What was that about?

10:15.451 --> 10:16.884
I don't know.

10:16.885 --> 10:19.454
But I wish I'd thought of it.

10:19.455 --> 10:21.589
One more clove.

10:21.590 --> 10:24.325
And... still not quite right.

10:24.326 --> 10:25.326
Focus, Fe-Fe!

10:26.395 --> 10:28.429
I'm sure it's going to be fine.

10:28.430 --> 10:29.630
No, it's not fine.

10:29.631 --> 10:30.992
And you know what else isn't fine?

10:30.993 --> 10:32.856
I have been hearing a
lot of criticism tonight.

10:32.857 --> 10:34.602
Oh, good, you're aware of it.

10:34.603 --> 10:35.870
How could I not be?

10:35.871 --> 10:37.494
You've contradicted
Mother at every turn!

10:37.495 --> 10:40.775
Me? I'm not contradicting
her, I'm complimenting you.

10:40.776 --> 10:42.410
She's the critical one.

10:42.411 --> 10:43.578
She just has high standards.

10:43.579 --> 10:44.846
You would not understand that,

10:44.847 --> 10:48.483
as you are a person who
drinks hot dog water.

10:48.484 --> 10:53.521
Well, I'm not just going to
pour it down the drain, man.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.356
Just don't drive yourself crazy

10:55.357 --> 10:57.825
for someone who's never
going to appreciate it.

10:57.826 --> 10:59.449
How dare you insult
that wonderful woman?

10:59.450 --> 11:01.028
She made me the man that I am today.

11:01.029 --> 11:03.363
That's what I'm saying! It's her fault!

11:06.534 --> 11:09.636
I shouldn't even be
wearing pants right now!

11:11.973 --> 11:14.236
Here is the local haberdashery
right here on Main Street.

11:14.237 --> 11:14.876
And who's that?

11:14.877 --> 11:16.744
Oh, it's that lovable scamp Mr. Wilson

11:16.745 --> 11:18.379
having a hot cocoa

11:18.380 --> 11:20.882
with Miss Clara, the town librarian.

11:20.883 --> 11:23.950
Hey, yeah, he is!

11:25.486 --> 11:26.721
Speaking of cocoa,

11:26.722 --> 11:28.745
I don't see one black
person in this whole village.

11:28.746 --> 11:30.358
You see, Felix,

11:30.359 --> 11:32.427
that's the problem with
store-bought figurines.

11:32.428 --> 11:34.162
I hand-paint mine.

11:34.163 --> 11:36.364
It leads to a more inclusive village.

11:36.365 --> 11:40.367
Thank you, Mother, for
inspiring me to do even better.

11:41.569 --> 11:43.037
Hey.

11:43.038 --> 11:44.404
Hey, Emily.

11:49.444 --> 11:50.878
I needed a little break from work.

11:50.879 --> 11:52.647
That party is already getting wild.

11:52.648 --> 11:54.515
Oh, hi!

11:54.516 --> 11:55.783
I'm Emily.

11:55.784 --> 11:58.553
Oh, yes, the barmaid who thinks

11:58.554 --> 12:00.320
she's too good for my son.

12:01.622 --> 12:03.357
Well, look at that! Break's over!

12:03.358 --> 12:05.226
Back to work I go.

12:05.227 --> 12:06.594
Hold the elevator, Emily!

12:06.595 --> 12:07.795
I've got to get to work too!

12:07.796 --> 12:09.230
You work here.

12:09.231 --> 12:10.231
I quit.

12:10.232 --> 12:11.531
Happy holidays!

12:12.533 --> 12:14.202
Well, too bad the
girls are going to miss

12:14.203 --> 12:15.803
making gingerbread houses.

12:15.804 --> 12:18.739
This year's theme is
mid-century modern.

12:18.740 --> 12:20.340
Yes!

12:21.108 --> 12:22.677
I'll get the candy adornments.

12:22.678 --> 12:24.579
Could someone move my buche de Noel?

12:24.580 --> 12:26.414
Oh, sure... tell me where it's parked.

12:26.415 --> 12:29.116
She's talking about a cake, man.

12:29.117 --> 12:32.086
Good Lord, be careful with it, Oscar.

12:32.087 --> 12:33.820
Muscles, help him.

12:37.358 --> 12:39.560
Show-off.

12:39.561 --> 12:41.963
How long do we have to stay?

12:41.964 --> 12:43.898
You know we're going to miss Santa.

12:43.899 --> 12:45.299
I can't leave.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.767
Felix may not see it, but he
needs my support right now.

12:48.836 --> 12:49.704
What's that?

12:49.705 --> 12:50.705
It's a receipt.

12:50.706 --> 12:52.907
Here, give me that.

12:52.908 --> 12:54.742
Oh, my God!

12:54.743 --> 12:56.811
She bought this cake!

12:56.812 --> 12:58.513
Do you know what this means?

12:58.514 --> 13:00.114
She gets the biggest piece?

13:00.115 --> 13:03.284
No, she told Felix she made it.

13:03.285 --> 13:06.187
So she works at a bakery.

13:06.188 --> 13:09.090
No, she lied to Felix about it.

13:09.091 --> 13:10.825
So this is my chance to show him

13:10.826 --> 13:13.127
that she's not perfect so
he can stop trying to be.

13:13.128 --> 13:14.729
He'll be so much happier.

13:14.730 --> 13:16.197
Great! Show it to him!

13:16.198 --> 13:17.298
I can't.

13:17.299 --> 13:18.866
He'll get mad at me.

13:18.867 --> 13:21.001
He needs to find it for himself.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.772
I can't believe I'm asking you this,

13:24.773 --> 13:26.806
but do you have any ideas?

13:28.075 --> 13:29.744
I do.

13:29.745 --> 13:31.044
Follow me.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.317
Where are you going?

13:36.318 --> 13:38.085
Oh, I'm going to Langford's.

13:38.086 --> 13:39.619
That was my idea.

13:40.488 --> 13:41.422
Bye, Felix.

13:41.423 --> 13:43.256
Bye, Mrs. Felix!

13:44.759 --> 13:48.062
Well, I see our friends prefer
to carouse in a common tavern.

13:48.063 --> 13:49.196
Too bad for them.

13:49.197 --> 13:50.697
Poor bastards.

13:51.933 --> 13:53.967
All that beer and happiness.

13:55.403 --> 13:56.504
Where's your mom?

13:56.505 --> 13:57.805
She went to go call Randy.

13:57.806 --> 13:59.874
But we could get started
on the candy cane carports.

13:59.875 --> 14:02.476
That is if you still
want to participate.

14:02.477 --> 14:03.711
Wait a minute,

14:03.712 --> 14:05.880
is the star on top of the
Christmas tree crooked?

14:05.881 --> 14:07.415
What?

14:07.416 --> 14:09.584
My mistake.

14:09.585 --> 14:11.284
Look, litter!

14:15.389 --> 14:17.992
It's a receipt.

14:17.993 --> 14:19.159
From a bakery.

14:21.062 --> 14:22.697
For a buche de Noel.

14:22.698 --> 14:24.631
What?!

14:26.367 --> 14:29.003
But that would mean that Mother
didn't make the cake herself.

14:29.004 --> 14:31.706
So, clearly she's not perfect.

14:31.707 --> 14:34.075
Which means you can stop trying to be.

14:34.076 --> 14:36.042
You must be so relieved.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.946
Last year's buche... exactly the same.

14:41.616 --> 14:43.684
And the year before that...

14:43.685 --> 14:46.153
And the year before that.

14:46.154 --> 14:48.456
How enlightening.

14:48.457 --> 14:49.656
Hmm.

14:51.959 --> 14:54.195
Well, I did it.

14:54.196 --> 14:57.064
I've saved Christmas.

15:08.943 --> 15:11.044
Tough week for cakes.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.985
Randy says the remodel is back on track.

15:17.986 --> 15:19.820
Felix, what are you doing?

15:19.821 --> 15:23.556
Oh, just destroying the proof
that my life is based on a lie!

15:27.294 --> 15:30.430
Family and holidays, huh?

15:46.596 --> 15:48.680
Felix, what are you doing to my cake?

15:48.681 --> 15:50.113
Your cake?

15:50.114 --> 15:53.349
It was store bought!

15:55.218 --> 15:57.353
I don't know what you mean.

15:58.855 --> 16:01.357
Well, I'm feeling a
little third wheel-y.

16:02.225 --> 16:04.493
And I'm feeling a little insulted.

16:07.264 --> 16:10.434
Well, does this look familiar?

16:10.435 --> 16:14.237
It's a receipt for one buche de Noel.

16:14.238 --> 16:16.773
Fine, my kitchen wasn't
in working condition

16:16.774 --> 16:19.242
because of the remodel, so
this year I bought the cake.

16:19.243 --> 16:20.844
This year?

16:20.845 --> 16:23.981
Well, let's take a little
stroll down memory lane,

16:23.982 --> 16:26.649
with a sharp left on betrayal boulevard!

16:28.085 --> 16:29.118
Bought.

16:30.721 --> 16:32.321
Bought.

16:33.290 --> 16:35.325
Bought.

16:35.326 --> 16:37.594
All right, I didn't make the cakes.

16:37.595 --> 16:40.304
Now can we move on to
our gingerbread houses?

16:40.305 --> 16:42.273
Listen, while I am in
no way responsible...

16:42.274 --> 16:43.941
Sit down, Oscar! It's craft time!

16:43.942 --> 16:45.943
All right.

16:45.944 --> 16:47.945
Mother, you owe me an explanation.

16:47.946 --> 16:50.581
I don't know why you're
making such a fuss.

16:50.582 --> 16:51.649
It's just a cake.

16:51.650 --> 16:53.117
It's not a cake, it's a lie.

16:53.118 --> 16:54.741
What else have you
lied to me about, hmm?

16:54.742 --> 16:56.287
Nothing, what are you talking about?

16:56.288 --> 16:59.022
Put the gumdrops down.

17:00.458 --> 17:02.026
You hid this for 40 years.

17:02.027 --> 17:04.228
What other flaws have
you been hiding from me?

17:04.229 --> 17:06.864
Why is it so important
to you that I have flaws?

17:06.865 --> 17:08.065
Because it would be nice to know

17:08.066 --> 17:09.433
that you are an actual human being

17:09.434 --> 17:10.795
and not just some impossible ideal

17:10.796 --> 17:12.019
that I could never live up to.

17:12.020 --> 17:14.326
Fine, you want a flaw?

17:15.172 --> 17:17.107
I'm not the president of my garden club,

17:17.108 --> 17:18.340
I'm just a member.

17:20.344 --> 17:21.846
That's not so bad.

17:21.847 --> 17:23.646
And I don't have a master's degree.

17:24.682 --> 17:26.585
And I know you think I
clean the house myself...

17:26.586 --> 17:28.519
Oh, my God!

17:28.520 --> 17:29.753
But when you were at school...

17:29.754 --> 17:30.654
Don't say it!

17:30.655 --> 17:32.590
I brought in a maid!

17:32.591 --> 17:33.990
No!

17:35.926 --> 17:37.394
Don't you see? If I'd known about

17:37.395 --> 17:39.778
some of these flaws then maybe
I could have accepted my own.

17:39.779 --> 17:42.600
Do you have any idea how
hard it is to be so...

17:42.601 --> 17:43.667
so...

17:43.668 --> 17:45.668
Anal? Sorry, continue.

17:46.845 --> 17:49.006
You're the reason that I
have to vacuum north to south.

17:49.007 --> 17:50.641
Why I alphabetize all the canned goods.

17:50.642 --> 17:52.910
Why I won't let Oscar put
his bare feet up on the couch.

17:52.911 --> 17:56.079
Wearing socks makes my feet sweat.

17:58.382 --> 17:59.894
I'm sorry, Mother, this
is a lot to process.

17:59.895 --> 18:01.728
I think, maybe, perhaps
you should go home

18:01.729 --> 18:03.163
and spend Christmas with Randy.

18:03.164 --> 18:04.531
Well, I can't really do that.

18:04.532 --> 18:05.365
Why not?

18:05.366 --> 18:07.734
Randy left me six months ago.

18:07.735 --> 18:09.569
What?

18:09.570 --> 18:11.614
He told me I was too judgmental,

18:11.615 --> 18:13.739
but he's just the type of
person who thinks like that.

18:15.142 --> 18:17.144
So he's not doing the remodel?

18:17.145 --> 18:18.512
There is no remodel.

18:18.513 --> 18:20.580
I made that up as an excuse to come here

18:20.581 --> 18:22.149
so you wouldn't find out I'm alone.

18:22.150 --> 18:23.984
Mother, why did you
hide all of this from me?

18:23.985 --> 18:26.653
I wanted to set a good example

18:26.654 --> 18:28.722
so you'd strive to be the very best.

18:28.723 --> 18:31.825
I'm sorry, Felix.

18:31.826 --> 18:34.694
I never wanted to disappoint
you, but now you know.

18:34.695 --> 18:38.564
Your perfect mother is
actually a bit of a mess.

18:41.735 --> 18:46.022
Well, if there's one thing
I've learned from Oscar,

18:46.023 --> 18:49.559
it's that a little mess
isn't the end of the world.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.128
Thank you, Felix.

18:52.129 --> 18:55.197
You're the only perfect
thing I've ever done.

18:57.100 --> 18:58.668
Oh...

18:58.669 --> 18:59.835
I shouldn't, I'm filthy.

19:02.171 --> 19:03.972
Oh!

19:06.175 --> 19:08.645
Oh, now we're both a mess.

19:08.646 --> 19:11.546
Well, I know a place
you'll fit right in.

19:12.615 --> 19:15.351
♪ Joy to the world ♪

19:15.352 --> 19:17.720
- ♪ The Lord is... ♪
- ♪ Our fries have come ♪

19:17.721 --> 19:20.290
- ♪ Let earth receive... ♪
- Stop stealing my fries, Teddy,

19:20.291 --> 19:23.359
unless you want me to kick
this curled foot up your butt.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.961
And ring the bell.

19:24.962 --> 19:26.629
What fun!

19:26.630 --> 19:28.331
Yes, it's like that lively party

19:28.332 --> 19:30.365
down on the lower decks of the Titanic.

19:31.801 --> 19:33.469
Ho, ho, ho!

19:33.470 --> 19:34.737
Welcome, Felix.

19:34.738 --> 19:37.006
And who is your lovely date?

19:37.007 --> 19:39.275
Father Christmas, this
is mother Meredith.

19:39.276 --> 19:43.313
Oh, you have a smudge of
frosting on your cheek.

19:43.314 --> 19:45.181
I'm sorry, I'm a mess.

19:45.182 --> 19:47.617
Oh, I think it's cute.

19:47.618 --> 19:50.252
I'm Fred, by the way.

19:51.154 --> 19:53.122
This is just a costume.

19:53.123 --> 19:54.824
Would you like some eggnog?

19:54.825 --> 19:56.759
It's 90 percent rum.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.194
I'd be a hundred percent delighted.

20:02.498 --> 20:03.932
It was Fred the whole time?

20:05.935 --> 20:08.972
Well, Oscar, me inadvertently
finding that receipt

20:08.973 --> 20:10.773
has brought me and
Mother closer together,

20:10.774 --> 20:13.443
so thank you for meddling.

20:13.444 --> 20:16.379
Consider that my Christmas gift to you.

20:16.380 --> 20:19.147
Because I didn't get you anything else.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.719
- Merry Christmas, buddy.
- Merry Christmas.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.120
Okay, everyone!

20:24.121 --> 20:27.857
We have printed up all the
unpaid bar tabs for the year.

20:27.858 --> 20:29.659
Whosever tab Santa pulls

20:29.660 --> 20:31.828
will have all of their debts forgiven.

20:34.098 --> 20:35.964
- Santa?
- Oh.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.501
Oh, damn it,

20:38.502 --> 20:40.502
it's Oscar!
