WEBVTT

01:57.551 --> 01:58.817
Turn the light on

02:07.361 --> 02:09.328
This is my mothers house,

02:10.163 --> 02:12.598
untouched since she died,

02:13.667 --> 02:18.303
and unconnected to any modern
form of technology.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.808
We should be safe here.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.620
Are you ready to record?

02:35.556 --> 02:36.488
Ready

02:38.492 --> 02:39.424
[ technical sound ]

02:41.262 --> 02:42.327
Good

02:44.665 --> 02:46.465
Good evening,

02:46.467 --> 02:49.468
and welcome to the end of the
world.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.703
My world.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.574
My name is Anton Goodfellow, Dr.
Goodfellow.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.610
I am CEO of Winestone Inc.

02:58.612 --> 03:01.480
where I succeeded Dr Faust.

03:01.782 --> 03:05.851
And I will be your host during
this short presentation

03:06.587 --> 03:10.689
on how my species managed to
systematically destroy itself,

03:11.926 --> 03:16.828
expertly assisted of course by
my machine learning friend
here.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.598
Introduce yourself.

03:19.600 --> 03:29.708
C02JK0TVDTY4Z-2--27

03:29.710 --> 03:35.347
C02JK0TVDTY4Z-2--27

03:35.349 --> 03:37.616
But I like to call him Paris.

03:37.818 --> 03:44.389
I have no idea if anyone will
ever actually see this,

03:44.658 --> 03:46.625
but we live in hope.

03:46.994 --> 03:50.262
Context.

03:50.931 --> 03:54.299
Yes, of course.

03:54.301 --> 03:57.369
Would you mind checking the
replay?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.440
Dr.Goodfellow.

04:01.442 --> 04:04.243
I am CEO von Winestone Inc.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.712
where I succeeded Dr Faust.

04:08.315 --> 04:11.650
Good. Let the macabre theater
begin.

04:12.353 --> 04:15.420
Dr. Faust was the head of one
company

04:16.589 --> 04:21.660
Winestone Inc., the largest
tech-company in Silicon Valley

04:21.661 --> 04:23.829
Whose main area of expertise

04:23.831 --> 04:27.366
was artificial intelligence

04:27.501 --> 04:30.335
But Dr. Faust has also mastered
the art of

04:30.337 --> 04:32.337
moving between certain points in
time

04:32.339 --> 04:33.739
and space

04:33.741 --> 04:35.040
time travel

04:35.042 --> 04:37.709
Yes, time travel

04:37.711 --> 04:43.548
However, what Faust really
wanted to create was the world's
first super human

04:43.550 --> 04:46.485
to outdo God's creation,

04:46.487 --> 04:49.621
a feat that man has dreamed
about

04:49.623 --> 04:54.593
since he first gazed up at the
sky many millennia ago.

04:56.630 --> 05:01.433
Let us go back to before it was
rotten,

05:01.435 --> 05:06.071
and meet the perpetrators who
set this in motion.

05:08.008 --> 05:12.344
We have before us God and
Mephisto.

05:12.346 --> 05:15.414
Now Mephisto has seen too much
of humanity,

05:15.416 --> 05:18.550
he thinks of mortals as easily
corruptible,

05:18.552 --> 05:25.357
easily conquered, and easily
swayed.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.960
We may have reason and
intelligence

05:28.962 --> 05:30.762
but we are still not happy.

05:30.764 --> 05:35.000
But God, does not agree.

05:39.473 --> 05:43.508
Earth's little god's shaped out
the same old clay,

05:44.945 --> 05:48.013
The mortal is the same queer
fish he was on the first day.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.450
He'd be much better off, in my
opinion,

05:51.452 --> 05:54.086
without the bit of heavenly
light you dealt him out.

05:56.523 --> 06:00.559
Is that all you can do,
criticize eternally?

06:01.695 --> 06:04.062
Is nothing ever right for you
down there sir?

06:06.834 --> 06:11.970
No, nothing, Lord - all's just
as bad as ever.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.741
Do you know Faust?

06:20.581 --> 06:22.114
The Doctor?

06:22.116 --> 06:23.915
My good servant!

06:23.917 --> 06:29.988
If today his service seems
confused, disordered,

06:29.990 --> 06:34.726
He will with my help see the way
clear forward.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.929
Would you care to bet on that?

06:37.931 --> 06:41.633
You'll lose, I promise you.

06:41.835 --> 06:47.873
If you'll give me leave to lead
the fellow
down my broad, my primrose path.

06:48.575 --> 06:52.577
As long as Faustus walks the
earth

06:52.579 --> 06:57.949
I shan't, I promise, interfere.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.819
Well thank you, Lord

07:00.821 --> 07:04.756
it's not the dead and gone that
I like dealing with.

07:06.460 --> 07:10.462
I much prefer are round and rosy
cheeks.

07:12.666 --> 07:18.103
Well...Yet I'll seduce him from
it soon enough.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.773
I'm not afraid I'll lose my bet.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.577
And when I have won,

07:25.579 --> 07:35.720
You won't, I trust, begrudge my
shouts of
triumph, cry of victory

07:36.857 --> 07:39.724
I do not hate your likes much

07:40.093 --> 07:43.161
I find of all the spirits of
denial,

07:43.497 --> 07:48.867
You jeerers not my severest
trial.

07:50.170 --> 07:53.238
Man's very quick to slacken in
his efforts,

07:53.574 --> 07:58.043
What he likes best is Sunday
peace and quite

07:59.613 --> 08:04.983
So I'm glad to give him a devil
for his own good,

08:04.985 --> 08:11.156
To prod and poke and incite him
as a devil should.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.535
So we go from heaven to Silicon
Valley,

08:23.537 --> 08:26.671
and here we find our
exceptionally intellectual

08:26.673 --> 08:31.109
and learned friend Dr Faust.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.179
Although he has revolutionised
the world,

08:34.181 --> 08:36.414
he is demoralised,

08:36.416 --> 08:38.650
for he is no closer to
constructing his Superhuman.

08:38.652 --> 08:43.722
He may have mastered the
traditional and conventional
modes
of thought,

08:43.724 --> 08:47.592
but that cannot help him

08:47.594 --> 08:49.961
to understand all the numerous

08:49.963 --> 08:57.702
and varied phenomena of life and
nature.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.638
He is too human,

08:59.640 --> 09:03.275
he cannot separate consciousness
and existence.

09:03.277 --> 09:04.576
Who's telling this story?

09:04.578 --> 09:05.210
We are!

09:05.212 --> 09:07.979
Good point.

09:34.274 --> 09:39.144
How hard I've slaved away,

09:39.146 --> 09:43.248
With what result?

09:43.250 --> 09:46.051
Poor foolish old man,

09:49.222 --> 09:52.924
I'm no whit wiser than when I
began!

09:57.698 --> 10:01.666
Which is why I turned to magic

10:01.668 --> 10:04.636
So I may penetrate the power

10:04.638 --> 10:08.306
That holds the universe
together.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.811
Who is calling?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.647
You're Faust?

10:15.649 --> 10:19.017
The one who at my breath's Least
touch,

10:19.019 --> 10:21.920
shudders to his depths,

10:21.922 --> 10:27.025
A thing that wriggles off,
scared, a worm!

10:29.896 --> 10:32.897
I'm him, yes

10:32.899 --> 10:37.636
Faust, your equal, the same.

10:37.638 --> 10:42.807
You equal the spirit you think I
am,

10:42.809 --> 10:45.143
Not me!

10:47.848 --> 10:50.815
Not you?

10:50.817 --> 10:53.785
Then who?

10:53.787 --> 10:57.922
Me, made in God's own image,

10:57.924 --> 11:00.992
Not even equal to you?

11:06.833 --> 11:09.834
Faust's second in command is
Wagner.

11:09.836 --> 11:13.071
Chief Principal Scientist of
Winestone Inc.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.440
and head of the A.I. research
program.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.117
Parchment,

11:27.187 --> 11:29.320
tell me

11:29.322 --> 11:31.723
that's the sacred fount you
drink out of.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.793
To slake your eternal thirst?

11:35.796 --> 11:40.365
The only true refreshment that
exists you get from where?

11:40.367 --> 11:44.302
Yourself - where all things
start.

11:44.304 --> 11:47.839
What you call an age's spirit,

11:47.841 --> 11:50.041
What is it?

11:50.043 --> 11:53.344
Nothing but your own poor spirit

11:57.384 --> 12:02.754
If only I had wings to rise into
the air and follow ever
after!

12:03.824 --> 12:06.891
I don't really envy birds their
wings.

12:07.494 --> 12:11.496
How different are the pleasures
of the intellect

12:12.365 --> 12:16.935
Sustaining one from page to
page, from book to book,

12:18.371 --> 12:21.039
And goodness,

12:21.041 --> 12:24.109
when you spread out an old
parchment,

12:25.045 --> 12:28.813
Heaven's fetched straight down
into your study.

12:31.218 --> 12:34.285
You know the one great driving
force,

12:34.855 --> 12:37.856
May you never know the other!

12:38.792 --> 12:41.860
Two souls live in me,

12:43.263 --> 12:46.798
alas, Irreconcilable with one
another.

12:48.101 --> 12:54.272
One lusting for the world with
all its might,

12:54.274 --> 13:00.245
Grapples it close, greedy of all
its pleasures,

13:00.947 --> 13:06.251
The other rises up,

13:06.253 --> 13:09.821
up from the dirt,

13:09.823 --> 13:14.459
Up to the blest fields where
dwell our great forbears.

13:14.461 --> 13:19.864
you really are a dusty old
stick.

13:25.472 --> 13:31.242
Faust is dejected, disheartened,
deeply depressed.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.444
He retires to his room,

13:33.446 --> 13:35.497
draws a bath,

13:35.498 --> 13:37.549
his soul heavy in the assumed
knowledge

13:37.551 --> 13:41.085
that he will never gain the
access he needs

13:41.087 --> 13:43.555
to mimic and outdo God's
creation.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.334
I'm no God,

13:56.336 --> 13:59.037
only too well do I know it!

13:59.840 --> 14:02.307
A worm's what I am,

14:02.309 --> 14:05.376
wriggling through the soot

14:08.582 --> 14:12.116
Vial, I salute you,

14:13.019 --> 14:16.087
And reverently bring you down
from the shelf,

14:17.958 --> 14:21.025
Honoring in you man's craft and
cunning

14:23.430 --> 14:26.497
Quintessence of easeful sleeping
potions,

14:28.301 --> 14:32.570
Pure distillation of subtle
poisons,

14:35.442 --> 14:42.180
Do your master the kindness that
lies in your power!

14:55.662 --> 15:00.064
What deep-sounding burden,

15:00.066 --> 15:04.269
what tremelo strain arrest the
glass before I can drink?

15:32.532 --> 15:34.265
Christ is arisen!

15:34.267 --> 15:37.035
Blest is the man of love,

15:37.037 --> 15:39.404
He who the anguishing,

15:39.406 --> 15:42.106
Bitter, exacting test,

15:42.108 --> 15:46.577
Salvation bringing, passed.

15:48.448 --> 15:53.351
But why do you seek me out in
the dust,

15:53.353 --> 15:58.623
You music of Heaven, mild and
magnificient

15:59.459 --> 16:01.459
Your message is clear

16:01.461 --> 16:04.362
but it leaves me indifferent.

16:04.664 --> 16:09.534
And where belief's lacking no
miracle possible.

16:10.370 --> 16:14.706
Your song gave the signal for
the games we all joined in

16:14.708 --> 16:18.109
When the springtime arrived with
its gay festival,

16:20.413 --> 16:24.082
Innocent childhood remembered
emotion

16:24.084 --> 16:27.218
Holds me back from the final
step

16:27.554 --> 16:32.490
O sound away, sound away sweet
songs of Heaven,

16:33.393 --> 16:37.261
The earth claims me again,

16:39.065 --> 16:42.066
my tears well up, fall!

16:43.069 --> 16:48.239
God in all his infinite wisdom
has intervened in Faust's
suicide attempt.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.309
He saved his life through an
angel.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.212
So he can win a bet.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.748
Faust attends a folk festival,

16:56.750 --> 16:59.550
a large celebration amongst his
peers

16:59.552 --> 17:06.190
and some less noble types, where
he is idolised for his many
contributions to society.

17:08.228 --> 17:13.698
Now face about and looking down
from the hilltop to town,

17:14.434 --> 17:20.371
See the brightly coloured crowd
pouring like a spring floud

17:21.340 --> 17:27.444
But by myself I'd never come
near here, for I can't abide
the least vulgarity,

17:28.048 --> 17:34.552
The fiddling, shrieking,
clashing bowls, for me are all
an
unbearable uproar

17:35.755 --> 17:41.559
What gratification must be yours
to win such popular
applause.

18:15.195 --> 18:19.263
Don't you see that white dog in
the stubble coursing back
and forth?

18:20.333 --> 18:23.434
Look again.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.504
What kind of creature is it?

18:35.782 --> 18:42.386
Faust's keen eye allows him to
detect something is not quite
right about this creature,

18:42.388 --> 18:46.557
that this creature is not the
creature it presents itself to
be.

18:47.327 --> 18:50.394
The masquerade is quickly
revealed.

19:03.209 --> 19:06.277
Why all the racket?

19:11.284 --> 19:14.352
What's your wish, sir?

19:16.256 --> 19:19.323
So it's you who was the poodle!

19:19.859 --> 19:22.927
And what's your name?

19:24.164 --> 19:30.902
A humble part of that great
power which always means evil,
always does good.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.238
And havoc and ruin

19:35.909 --> 19:38.910
all you call evil, in sum

19:38.912 --> 19:42.813
For me's the element in which I
swim.

19:44.851 --> 19:50.888
To Faust it seems he has
accidentally invoked the devil

19:50.890 --> 19:54.559
A devil who lay in plain site
waiting to be recognised.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.627
Indeed. Good automaton.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.397
And he speaks to Faust in the
language of power,

19:59.399 --> 20:06.904
for the skin Mephisto walks in
is that of a Hedge Fund
Technology Manager for Winestone
Inc,

20:07.240 --> 20:10.341
with a controlling share in the
company.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.977
And so he immediately proposes a
deal,

20:12.979 --> 20:16.881
he will assist Faust in his
quest for divine knowledge

20:16.883 --> 20:20.618
by granting him access to the
secrets of creation,

20:20.620 --> 20:24.889
as well as the resources in
which to create.

20:24.891 --> 20:33.598
But in return he wants access to
all digital data Faust has
on mortals

20:33.600 --> 20:35.266
A strange request.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.802
Seemingly yes, but information
is power,

20:37.804 --> 20:43.808
and like God, Mephisto wants to
use all advantages at hand
to win the bet,

20:43.810 --> 20:46.477
however unlike God,

20:46.479 --> 20:50.514
he also wants to have some fun
along the way.

20:53.286 --> 20:59.657
It is my greatest pleasure to
announce the pact,

20:59.659 --> 21:02.793
the CEO of Winestone Inc.

21:03.029 --> 21:07.898
and Mephisto, a man who needs no
introduction

21:15.308 --> 21:18.376
I promise, I will serve your
wishes - here

21:18.578 --> 21:21.479
A slave who does your bidding
faithfully

21:21.481 --> 21:24.415
But if we meet each other -
there,

21:24.417 --> 21:27.485
Why, you must do the same for
me.

21:29.555 --> 21:32.623
If you ever see me loll at ease,

21:33.059 --> 21:35.960
Then it's all yours, you can
have it, my life!

21:36.696 --> 21:39.330
If ever you fool me with
flatteries

21:39.332 --> 21:41.565
Into feeling satisfied with
myself,

21:41.567 --> 21:44.302
Or tempt me visions of luxuries,

21:44.304 --> 21:48.906
That's it, the last day that I
breathe this air,

21:48.908 --> 21:51.876
I'll bet you!

21:51.878 --> 21:53.477
Done! A bet!

21:53.479 --> 21:56.547
A bet! I swear!

22:16.836 --> 22:20.037
Mephisto decides to take Faust
to Berghain.

22:20.039 --> 22:23.374
Berghain, a nightclub in Berlin,
Germany

22:23.376 --> 22:27.745
named after its location near
the border between Kreuzberg
and Friedrichshain.

22:27.914 --> 22:31.048
Associated with decadence and
hedonism.

22:31.050 --> 22:35.052
After all, one cannot know the
secrets of the universe
without knowing both

22:35.054 --> 22:39.357
the joys of good and the
delights of evil,

22:39.492 --> 22:41.792
and one cannot know or
understand God

22:41.794 --> 22:43.861
without this knowledge

22:43.863 --> 22:47.698
and true knowledge can only be
gotten from experience.

22:47.967 --> 22:54.538
Plus Mephisto probably thought
Faust could do with unwinding
a little.

23:01.114 --> 23:04.382
And now where to?

23:04.917 --> 23:07.084
Wherever you like.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.987
First we'll mix with little
people. Then with great.

23:09.989 --> 23:14.158
The pleasure and the profits you
will get from our course

23:14.160 --> 23:15.760
and never pay tuition for it.

23:16.963 --> 23:19.797
By air's how we make our
departure,

23:20.566 --> 23:22.733
you enjoy the voyage.

23:22.735 --> 23:28.072
If we're light enough we'll lift
right up quickly off the
face of earth

23:58.504 --> 24:03.974
These dolts can't ever recognize
Old Nick even when he's got
them by the neck.

24:12.852 --> 24:16.787
simple pleasures cannot satisfy
Faust's needs,

24:17.123 --> 24:20.057
and so Mephisto takes him to see
a witch.

24:20.059 --> 24:22.526
She promises to rejuvenate him.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.103
Why, it's revolting all this
crazy witchery!

24:33.105 --> 24:37.842
Are you telling me that I'll be
born a new man here amid
this lunatic confusion?

25:13.145 --> 25:19.783
The witch offers him an elixir,
and it brings forth a vision

25:33.599 --> 25:36.667
What do I see?

25:40.706 --> 25:44.575
What a marvellous vision shows
itself in this magic glass!

25:45.578 --> 25:50.614
Woman unrivalled, beauty
absolute!

25:51.083 --> 25:56.220
Can such things be, a creature
made perfectly?

25:57.089 --> 26:01.158
The body so indolently stretched
out there

26:01.327 --> 26:04.595
surely epitomizes all that is
heavenly.

26:04.797 --> 26:07.865
One more look in the mirror, let
me!

26:08.000 --> 26:12.069
That woman was inexpressibly
lovely!

26:12.271 --> 26:18.709
No, no,

26:18.710 --> 26:25.148
soon enough, before you,
vis-Ã -vis,   Yours! the fairest
of
fair women, I guarantee.

26:31.223 --> 26:36.994
With that stuff in him, old Jack
will
Soon see Helen in every Jill.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.970
Faust returns to work with the
best intentions,

26:46.672 --> 26:51.275
to focus on his guest to create
his superhuman,

26:51.944 --> 26:56.046
however his baser instincts have
now been...

26:56.749 --> 27:00.234
aroused,

27:00.235 --> 27:03.720
and he can't help but notice 16
year old Gretchen.

27:03.723 --> 27:08.692
Innocent and pure. And the
companies receptionist.

27:45.998 --> 27:52.369
Pretty lady, here's my arm,

27:52.371 --> 27:58.976
Would you allow me to see you
home?

27:59.779 --> 28:02.713
I'm neither pretty nor a lady,

28:02.715 --> 28:05.783
Can find my way home quite
unaided

28:17.763 --> 28:24.435
"If I don't hold that darling
creature tight in my arms this
very night,

28:25.471 --> 28:31.709
We're through, we two, come
twelve midnight.

28:40.786 --> 28:47.357
Faust is, for the first time,
infected by his power

28:47.359 --> 28:55.165
and our chaste Gretchen is
awarded an unexpected promotion
as his new PA.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.835
He did love her ,you know.

28:58.104 --> 29:03.807
Eventually, his lust evolved to
love.

29:04.143 --> 29:09.513
An innocent mind not driven by
the mental turmoils of

29:09.515 --> 29:13.450
wanting to know everything, her
virtues could have saved him
and yet...

29:14.019 --> 29:17.087
here we are.

29:18.758 --> 29:21.191
Loves me -

29:22.194 --> 29:25.262
loves me not-

29:27.133 --> 29:28.832
Loves me

29:28.834 --> 29:31.101
Dearest, yes!

29:32.138 --> 29:38.942
Yes, let the flowers be, the
oracle by which the truth is
said.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.445
He loves you...

29:50.823 --> 29:53.891
Shall we never pass a quiet time
alone together,

29:54.460 --> 29:58.562
Breast pressed to breast, our
two beings one?

29:59.365 --> 30:02.099
Oh if I only slept alone!

30:02.101 --> 30:05.169
I'd draw the bolt for you
tonight, yes gladly

30:06.939 --> 30:09.873
But my mother sleeps so lightly,

30:09.875 --> 30:12.476
And if we were surprised by her

30:12.478 --> 30:15.546
I know I'd die right then and
there.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.554
Darling, there's no need to
worry,

30:25.090 --> 30:27.324
Here's a vial

30:27.326 --> 30:35.332
three drops only In her cup will
subdue nature and lull her
into pleasant slumber.

30:56.989 --> 30:59.957
Well, tell me, you must,

30:59.959 --> 31:03.627
about your religion - how do you
feel?

31:06.432 --> 31:12.102
You're such a good man, kind and
intelligent,

31:12.104 --> 31:15.472
Yet I suspect you are
indifferent.

31:17.409 --> 31:20.477
Enough of that,

31:23.883 --> 31:30.487
you know quite well I cherish
you so very dearly!

32:12.398 --> 32:16.166
Mephisto's sleeping drought has
killed Gretchen's mother,

32:16.335 --> 32:19.236
and Gretchen's brother, a
vengeful boy

32:19.238 --> 32:23.040
with no Devil on his side,
attempts to kill Faust

32:23.042 --> 32:27.444
in revenge for the destruction
of his sisters innocence.

32:41.360 --> 32:46.596
He does not succeed, and
Mephisto and Faust have no
choice
but to kill him.

32:50.269 --> 32:53.070
Who's lying here?

32:53.072 --> 32:56.139
Your mother's son

33:03.215 --> 33:06.984
My God, the misery, on and on.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.521
Do you pray for the soul of your
mother

33:11.523 --> 33:15.459
Who through you slept on and
still on into pain and more
pain?

33:16.261 --> 33:18.996
The blessed avert their faces
from you.

33:18.998 --> 33:23.200
Pure souls with a shudder snatch
their hands back from you.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.168
Poor thing!

33:28.674 --> 33:33.176
Faust and Mephisto escape the
crime scene unnoticed and

33:33.178 --> 33:36.213
What of Gretchen?

33:36.215 --> 33:40.050
She takes the blame for the
death of her mother and brother

33:40.052 --> 33:43.220
and is imprisoned.

33:43.222 --> 33:47.190
Things get out of hand sometimes

33:47.559 --> 33:52.162
We have to keep moving towards
our goal.
[helicopter and war sound]

33:52.331 --> 33:54.598
Like Faust.
[helicopter and war sound]

33:55.234 --> 33:58.301
Mephisto takes him to the
Brocken mountain,

33:58.470 --> 34:01.538
a bacchanal of music and carnal
lust.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.707
A place to forget.

34:03.709 --> 34:10.147
A place to collapse into
permanent degradation.

34:22.061 --> 34:24.161
There Urian mounts his throne.

34:24.163 --> 34:26.596
So over stock and stone go
stumping,

34:26.598 --> 34:31.201
Witches farting, billy goats
stinking!

34:32.504 --> 34:35.237
[laughing]

34:40.212 --> 34:41.578
Look over there,

34:44.850 --> 34:46.483
At that lovely girl,

34:46.484 --> 34:48.117
pale- faced with fear, standing
by herself.

34:48.687 --> 34:51.755
How laborously she pushes
herself forwards,

34:52.824 --> 34:54.690
wracked with pains,

34:54.693 --> 34:58.395
as if her feet were shackled
tight in chains.

34:59.798 --> 35:04.768
I must confess, it looks like
Gretchen.

35:06.271 --> 35:11.241
Medusa, did you ever hear of
her?

35:12.411 --> 35:15.345
Yes, yes,

35:15.347 --> 35:21.551
those are a corpse's eyes no
loving hand was by to close.

35:28.827 --> 35:31.895
But vices can only be
distracting for so long,

35:32.598 --> 35:35.565
and Faust's humanity is not
lost.

35:35.567 --> 35:39.436
Overtaken by a moral fever,

35:39.438 --> 35:42.472
he tries to free Gretchen from
her cell.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.541
But it is too late.

35:44.543 --> 35:47.611
She was with child.

35:47.880 --> 35:51.148
Oh this is to tragic for my
taste

35:53.285 --> 35:56.353
Only let me nurse the baby
first,

35:58.757 --> 36:02.926
All night long, I hugged the
dear creature

36:05.230 --> 36:12.302
How mean they were, snatched it
from my breast,

36:15.407 --> 36:18.475
And now they say I murdered it

36:21.914 --> 36:25.749
I'll never be happy, no never
again.

36:52.945 --> 36:55.679
Oh the cold lips you have,

36:55.681 --> 36:57.581
Cold and dumb.

36:57.583 --> 37:00.717
What become of your love,

37:00.719 --> 37:01.885
All gone?

37:04.523 --> 37:06.656
Who stole it from me?

37:48.734 --> 37:51.801
So Mephisto has not yet won his
bet with God,

37:52.371 --> 37:55.338
it has being upheld by Faust's
sudden,

37:55.340 --> 37:58.775
if not ill thought out, plan to
save Gretchen.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.711
But Faust is not satisfied,

38:01.713 --> 38:07.751
he hasn't sourced the seeds of
creation and he still has a
devil on his shoulder.

38:08.020 --> 38:12.656
And so the guilt drip, drip,
drips down,

38:12.891 --> 38:14.791
his heart becomes leaden,

38:14.793 --> 38:17.761
weighed down by the consequences
of his actions.

38:18.463 --> 38:21.531
And his despair is like a siren,

38:22.000 --> 38:26.636
which attracts the attentions of
his competitive God.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.673
Who doesn't like to lose a bet.

38:29.675 --> 38:33.910
And so God decides again to send
him an angel,

38:34.946 --> 38:38.782
this time to purify his soul,

38:38.784 --> 38:42.552
absolving him off his sins.

38:42.554 --> 38:48.725
He is born anew. He is forgiven.

38:50.595 --> 38:53.663
How comforting that must feel.

39:36.842 --> 39:39.909
Ameliorate the cruel Strife in
his heart,

39:40.579 --> 39:44.647
pluck out self-condemnation's
burning dart

39:45.584 --> 39:51.921
And wash his soul clean of the
horror and fright.

40:01.533 --> 40:05.535
Life pulses in me with a
quickened beat,

40:06.505 --> 40:09.572
Welcoming the dawn's eternal
light

40:10.409 --> 40:14.811
And you, Earth, too stood
steadfast through the night

40:14.813 --> 40:18.081
And now breath with new vigour
at my feet,

40:20.452 --> 40:24.487
filling me with so much
pleasure,

40:25.624 --> 40:28.958
Firing me with a purpose I'll
never forswear

40:30.028 --> 40:35.098
To strive after highest
existence always

41:09.868 --> 41:14.604
Oh no! The infallible God
failed.

41:36.895 --> 41:39.963
The end of humanity is imminent!

42:11.997 --> 42:14.831
It's only me.

42:17.002 --> 42:18.935
oh god, I can see it is you

42:18.937 --> 42:21.204
Who else could it be but you?

42:21.206 --> 42:24.274
Of course its you!

42:25.143 --> 42:31.714
I had such a nightmare.

42:32.851 --> 42:36.753
Oh god, god what a nightmare it
was

42:36.755 --> 42:38.588
terrible, terrible!

42:38.590 --> 42:43.326
I saw Faust's protecting angel
fall from the sky

42:43.328 --> 42:46.262
and crash onto the Earth.

42:46.264 --> 42:50.166
She was crucified on the cross.

42:51.136 --> 42:54.203
It shows that God's power is
dwindling.

42:54.673 --> 42:57.740
We are running out of time.

42:57.976 --> 43:00.276
Let us continue! And now we
must...

43:00.278 --> 43:04.681
move our gaze to the Emperor of
the Northern Empire.

43:05.917 --> 43:08.985
Nearly caused financial
bankruptcy by lowering taxes,

43:08.987 --> 43:13.890
whilst increasing government
spendings and initiating global
protectionism.

43:14.759 --> 43:17.327
And he needs someone to clean up
this mess.

43:17.329 --> 43:24.867
And who better then his newly
enlisted Chairman of the
Federal Reserve Mephisto,

43:25.670 --> 43:29.772
and Chief scientific advisor to
the Northern Empire

43:29.774 --> 43:31.741
Dr Faust.

43:35.246 --> 43:39.782
So Mephisto, a cunning economic
mind,

43:39.784 --> 43:42.986
when it comes to short term gain
anyway,

43:42.988 --> 43:46.923
drives interest rates to zero
and prints more money.

43:47.792 --> 43:49.859
The economy sharply -

43:49.861 --> 43:51.027
Temporarily!

43:51.029 --> 43:53.262
Recovers.

43:56.067 --> 43:59.002
He's Plutus, he is God of
Wealth!

43:59.638 --> 44:02.705
Come here himself in all his
pompery,

44:03.308 --> 44:05.908
The Emperor needs him urgently.

44:05.910 --> 44:07.644
Paper money,

44:07.646 --> 44:10.913
unlike gold and silver

44:10.915 --> 44:13.950
Says what it's worth on its
face,

44:14.686 --> 44:18.721
it doesn't require Endless
haggling before a person can,

44:18.723 --> 44:24.794
If he so wishes, indulge in love
and wine.

44:24.996 --> 44:31.067
[Mephisto laughing]

44:54.392 --> 44:58.194
Faust, in his newly minted
position,

44:58.196 --> 45:04.167
presents the Emperor with his
plan for creating the first
Superhuman,

45:04.169 --> 45:07.236
and the Emperor, is intrigued

45:07.972 --> 45:10.406
he wants to build, rather then
breed,

45:10.408 --> 45:15.344
a race modelled after his own
idea of aesthetic perfection.

45:15.847 --> 45:18.981
He wants flawless Gods.

45:22.087 --> 45:25.154
Using the technology granted to
him by Mephisto,

45:25.490 --> 45:28.291
Faust searches throughout
history,

45:28.993 --> 45:32.795
dimensions, realms for this
ideal,

45:32.797 --> 45:40.837
and finally he comes across
Helena of Troy.

45:42.440 --> 45:45.508
Said to be the most beautiful
woman in the world,

45:45.510 --> 45:48.177
married to King Menelaus of
Sparta,

45:48.179 --> 45:50.947
but abducted by Prince Paris of
Troy,

45:50.949 --> 45:53.349
resulting in the Trojan War.

45:53.351 --> 45:58.755
And he is captivated by their
good old fashioned
mathematical beauty

45:58.757 --> 46:01.357
We are modelled after the golden
ratio.

46:01.359 --> 46:04.160
Natures symmetry.

46:04.162 --> 46:06.229
Is that why you call me Paris?

46:06.231 --> 46:08.498
Don't be so vain...

46:09.300 --> 46:12.368
I'm at my wits'end, don't know
what to do

46:13.104 --> 46:16.172
The Chamberlain insists, the
Steward, too

46:16.775 --> 46:20.042
Produce at once, before the
Emperor,

46:20.044 --> 46:23.112
Helen and Paris as in life they
were,

46:23.348 --> 46:28.384
The very paragon of women,she,
Of men the very beau ideal,
he.

46:29.020 --> 46:32.021
Those old pagans are none of my
business.

46:32.023 --> 46:35.091
They've got their own Hell, not
at all like ours is.

46:35.860 --> 46:38.928
Still, there's a way.

46:39.397 --> 46:43.466
The key will sniff out where you
want to go

46:43.468 --> 46:45.902
and lead you to the Mothers.

46:47.105 --> 46:49.539
A glowing tripod, when you see
it,

46:49.541 --> 46:52.208
means You've reached the bottom
most,

46:52.210 --> 46:54.877
deepest depth of things,

46:55.046 --> 46:58.581
By the light it casts you'll see
the Mothers,

46:58.583 --> 47:01.851
Approach the tripod, never
hesitate,

47:04.155 --> 47:05.822
And touch it with the key.

47:05.824 --> 47:07.256
Up, up you rise,

47:07.258 --> 47:11.828
be brought back to us here
before they even notice.

47:12.096 --> 47:18.034
Once back, summon from out of
the night the hero and heroine

48:46.024 --> 48:48.624
Excuse me, but from what I've
seen,

48:48.626 --> 48:52.995
I'd say the Rape of Helen is the
title of this play.

48:52.997 --> 48:55.564
Rape! I'm nothing here?

48:55.566 --> 48:57.500
Rape, if you please!

48:57.502 --> 49:00.469
Don't you see this key still in
my hand!

49:01.339 --> 49:04.407
So far away once, could she now
be closer?

49:04.542 --> 49:07.944
If I rescue her she's mine twice
over.

49:09.180 --> 49:11.180
Then risk it!

49:11.182 --> 49:13.582
Mothers, Mothers, let me have
her!

49:13.584 --> 49:17.987
When once you've seen her you
can't live without her!

49:23.227 --> 49:26.295
But Dr Faust forgets himself,

49:26.297 --> 49:29.598
as scientists we observe and we
do not interfere

49:29.600 --> 49:33.502
no matter how tantalising the
subject may be.

49:33.504 --> 49:36.572
And now his soul is afflicted.

49:37.408 --> 49:40.476
He is brought to his laboratory
by Mephisto,

49:41.012 --> 49:43.412
where Wagner is working on

49:43.414 --> 49:44.347
Homunculus.

49:44.349 --> 49:48.351
Yes. The first Superhuman.

49:48.586 --> 49:51.087
Your ancestor as such.

49:51.089 --> 49:56.258
The personification of intellect
but without all those pesky
human emotions.

49:57.161 --> 49:59.195
He's rudimentary.

49:59.197 --> 50:02.198
Thats because to complete his
existence,

50:02.200 --> 50:04.266
upgrade him if you will,

50:04.268 --> 50:08.671
they must travel to the Greek
Underworld

50:08.673 --> 50:11.741
and seek Proteus the old man of
the sea,

50:11.743 --> 50:15.378
who has the final vital
ingredient

50:15.380 --> 50:19.048
to make Homunculus a real boy.

50:19.050 --> 50:21.017
What of Faust?

50:21.552 --> 50:25.488
His unfortunate condition can
only be fixed by Helena.

50:25.490 --> 50:28.624
And so Homunculus already
pulling his weight,

50:28.626 --> 50:32.661
reprograms Faust's time loop,
and away they go.

50:36.134 --> 50:39.201
A man's creation.

50:42.707 --> 50:44.273
No!

50:44.275 --> 50:50.346
Have you two lovers snugly
tucked up there inside that
chimney?

50:53.651 --> 50:56.452
God forbid!

50:57.655 --> 51:05.127
Our ancient mode of breeding we
now pronounce a clownish,
coarse proceeding.

51:05.797 --> 51:09.298
To make out of the mixture human
matter

51:10.101 --> 51:13.202
Then sealing up in a limbec
carefully,

51:13.204 --> 51:17.373
We redistill the contents
thoroughly,

51:17.642 --> 51:20.709
To find at least all's been
accomplished quietly.

51:24.082 --> 51:27.750
I see the delicate outline
within

51:27.752 --> 51:32.321
of something gesturing, a
manikin!

51:38.362 --> 51:42.431
It's brother Rascal, am I right?

51:45.403 --> 51:49.271
You'ver come, I must say, very
opportunely.

51:50.641 --> 51:53.242
You've got to move him
elsewhere.

51:53.711 --> 51:56.645
Just now it has occurred to me

51:57.415 --> 51:59.348
That by a very happy chance

51:59.350 --> 52:01.450
It's classical Walpurgis Night

52:01.452 --> 52:06.122
Just his element, for him just
right.

52:08.326 --> 52:11.393
The northwest, Satan is your
stamping ground,

52:13.431 --> 52:16.499
The southeast's the direction we
are bound.

52:17.735 --> 52:21.670
Through a great plain, through
thicket and through grove,

52:21.672 --> 52:24.507
Peneios flows along still,
sultry reaches,

52:26.344 --> 52:29.411
The plain extends back to the
mountain gorges,

52:29.747 --> 52:32.815
And old and new Pharsalus lie
above.

52:35.319 --> 52:38.387
Fetch the cloak and wrap our
knight up in it!

52:38.556 --> 52:42.925
The rag will bear you both, it's
always done it.

52:51.302 --> 52:57.673
In the end we are dependent on
the very creatures we
ourselves created.

53:05.583 --> 53:12.488
And so Homunculus already
pulling his weight, reprograms
Faust's time loop, and away they
go.

53:21.399 --> 53:24.300
My mother's revolver...

53:24.302 --> 53:27.369
Ready...

53:28.706 --> 53:31.340
They arrive on a magical
evening,

53:31.342 --> 53:33.809
that of Classic Walpurgis Night,

53:33.811 --> 53:36.745
a night where all Greek heroes,

53:36.747 --> 53:39.348
majestic creatures and Gods

53:39.350 --> 53:44.453
joyously come together to
celebrate that which unites
them.

54:06.978 --> 54:11.580
And in a breath You'll see life
returning to him

54:16.821 --> 54:22.858
Here miraculously I'm in Greece!

54:23.628 --> 54:26.695
Standing here, at once I knew
the place,

54:28.899 --> 54:31.967
A fresh spirit coursed again
through me,

54:32.503 --> 54:36.639
Roused the sleeper,
Antaeus-like, with its warmth.

54:44.382 --> 54:47.549
Our intrepid travellers split
up,

54:47.551 --> 54:52.721
Dr Faust, still afflicted by his
spell searches for his
Helena.

54:52.723 --> 54:55.691
He seeks her from all manner of
beasts,

54:55.693 --> 55:00.763
but is answered only by one,
Chiron.

55:06.737 --> 55:09.972
You've been taken in...

55:09.974 --> 55:13.676
For women in mythology enjoy a
special grace

55:14.612 --> 55:18.080
The poet shows them as his tale
requires.

55:18.649 --> 55:21.583
They never need endure a
wrinkled face,

55:21.585 --> 55:27.456
They keep their slim attractive
figures carried off in
youth,

55:27.458 --> 55:31.627
by crowds of suitors still
pursued in age.

55:31.629 --> 55:36.932
But to us spirits you look like
a madman.

55:39.503 --> 55:42.471
Now as it happens you're in luck
today

55:42.473 --> 55:46.075
I briefly visit Manto annually,

55:46.977 --> 55:55.651
Remain with her for awhile, I
feel assured that with herbs
you'll be completely cured.

55:55.653 --> 55:58.387
Keep your cures,

55:59.390 --> 56:02.691
my mind's in perfect order

56:02.827 --> 56:07.363
She'd make me like the rest,
ignoble, vulgar.

56:10.468 --> 56:14.837
So Chiron takes him across the
river Peneios to Manto,

56:14.839 --> 56:18.507
who can guide him to the
entrance of Olympus,

56:18.509 --> 56:21.577
where he can meet with
Persephone

56:21.579 --> 56:25.080
Goddess of the underworld and
wife of Hades,

56:25.750 --> 56:30.552
who has the power to curse
mortals as well as break curses
already placed on them.

56:30.554 --> 56:34.890
Manto tells him that the only
way to break the curse is to
ask Helena,

56:34.892 --> 56:38.694
the most beautiful woman in
known history,

56:38.696 --> 56:40.629
for her hand in marriage.

56:40.631 --> 56:43.565
What a chore for Faust.

56:43.567 --> 56:46.001
I love who wish impossibilities.

56:46.003 --> 56:49.738
Foolhardy fellow, enter and
rejoice!

56:50.508 --> 56:55.811
This passage follows a
descending course into Olympus's
hollow foot.

56:59.183 --> 57:02.151
And what of our tricky Devil,
Mephisto?

57:02.153 --> 57:05.187
Our playful unscrupulous
murderer?

57:05.189 --> 57:12.094
Well, whilst Faust seeks beauty
he seeks ugliness, and is
with the Lamia

57:12.096 --> 57:15.164
Lamia, mistress of Zeus,

57:15.166 --> 57:18.434
turned into a monster by Hera.

57:18.769 --> 57:21.837
Beautiful from the front,
hideous from behind.

57:22.740 --> 57:24.907
And desperate,

57:24.909 --> 57:27.643
they amuse our Devil.

58:01.479 --> 58:03.979
I know how to handle Northern
witches,

58:03.981 --> 58:06.114
but these foreign ones give me
twitches.

58:06.116 --> 58:08.617
Come, around our hero, dance.

58:08.619 --> 58:12.521
Love, we feel sure, shall
announce itself in him for one
of
us.

58:12.523 --> 58:14.790
The prettiest is the one I pick.

58:14.792 --> 58:17.626
Damm it, dry as a broomstick!

58:17.628 --> 58:21.763
How about her? That face, hard
grin!

59:23.093 --> 59:26.128
I never seem to learn,
apparently

59:26.297 --> 59:29.798
It's stupid in the North, it's
just as stupid here.

59:30.834 --> 59:35.237
Here as there the ghosts are
creepy, queer,

59:35.239 --> 59:41.743
The people crude, the poets
equally.

59:41.745 --> 59:44.947
But Mephisto tires of these
hags,

59:44.949 --> 59:47.583
and moves on in search of a
creature

59:47.585 --> 59:50.619
whose body he may inhabit

59:50.621 --> 59:54.790
so to pass undetected through
this realm.

59:55.626 --> 59:58.794
He meets the Phorkyas sisters.

59:58.796 --> 01:00:01.129
The personification of old age,

01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:05.667
they are doomed to share one eye
and one tooth between them.

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:12.674
They occupy the darkness, too
disgusting for the moon or sun
to look upon.

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:16.645
They are also very susceptible
to the devils charming
tongue,

01:00:16.647 --> 01:00:21.016
and they agree to lend him a
body.

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:04.826
I'm surprised no poet hymned
your praises.

01:01:05.929 --> 01:01:08.196
Here is my suggestion:

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:12.834
Let your trinity hand over one
of you to someone else

01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:17.939
With you three, one eye, one
tooth suffice

01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:22.944
So shouldn't it be possible for
you to squeeze together
mythologically

01:01:22.946 --> 01:01:26.982
And as two instead of three make
do?

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:32.154
Hm, hm - do we agree, we three?

01:01:34.258 --> 01:01:35.424
We do.

01:01:35.826 --> 01:01:40.162
But tooth and eye - they're out.

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:47.069
To hit you off exactly I must
have both!

01:02:02.486 --> 01:02:05.053
And then we have Homunculus,

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:09.057
who seeks out Proteus, patron of
creation.

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:13.395
He discovers the ocean is the
source of all life,

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:18.934
and asks Proteus to bless him
with consciousness, intuition,
beauty.

01:02:18.936 --> 01:02:21.436
And so he and Galatea

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:26.007
Midwife of the underworld, a
servant of Proteus, ruler of
creation.

01:02:26.009 --> 01:02:29.077
Who herself was once a... thing.

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.447
No offence.

01:02:32.449 --> 01:02:34.349
She was actually a statue,

01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:37.285
until she was loved and granted
life.

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:41.890
Right. Anyway, together they
give him a little jump start.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.527
The boy longs to be born,

01:02:45.529 --> 01:02:47.395
he needs your counsel.

01:02:48.532 --> 01:02:51.833
Go ask that wonderworker,
Proteus,

01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:56.371
The way one's born or changed or
something else.

01:02:57.474 --> 01:03:01.176
A real virgin's son, I see

01:03:01.779 --> 01:03:05.180
He's here before he ought to be.

01:03:11.355 --> 01:03:14.122
What is it flames all round the
shell,

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:17.359
a bright jet of fire that stoops
at the goddess's feet,

01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:21.296
Now blazing up fiercely, now
burning low,

01:03:21.532 --> 01:03:27.435
Like a heart full of love
beating fast, beating slow?

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:32.941
It's our little fellow,
Homunculus.

01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:04.039
So Faust must steal Helena away
from her husband Menelaus,

01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:06.541
through whatever means possible.

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:11.513
Mephisto helps him become a
powerful nobleman,

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:17.219
and he rules from an
impenetrable castle perched on
the
cliffs by the sea.

01:04:17.921 --> 01:04:19.054
Then ...

01:04:19.056 --> 01:04:22.290
Mephisto, still in Phorkyas'
disguise,

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:28.930
convinces Helena to leave her
husband for the warm and
loving protection of Faust.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:40.041
It's funny. When I first met my
wife,

01:04:40.444 --> 01:04:43.511
she was actually on a date with
another man.

01:04:44.014 --> 01:04:45.513
He'd left the bar to make a
phone call outside,

01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:51.253
and I convinced her to leave
with me and...

01:04:51.622 --> 01:04:54.890
Doesn't matter, we don't have
time.

01:04:56.193 --> 01:04:58.960
All's prepared in the house,

01:04:59.897 --> 01:05:02.964
tripod, flat bowl, sharp ax,

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:07.168
Water to sprinkle, incense to
burn afterwards.

01:05:08.438 --> 01:05:13.441
But the name of the victim, do
please tell me it, do.

01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:17.579
The King didn't say.

01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:23.151
Didn't say? Oh dear me!

01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:26.154
Dear me did you say?

01:05:26.156 --> 01:05:30.258
Queen, it's you who is meant.

01:05:31.995 --> 01:05:35.063
You shall die as a queen.

01:05:36.199 --> 01:05:41.369
But hung from the rooftree in
there like trushes just
snared,

01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:46.474
You'll dance one after the
other, your feet kicking the
air.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:51.279
They're scared to death, the
things.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:54.449
Well, I am not,

01:05:56.987 --> 01:05:59.688
It's pain I feel.

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:01.990
But if you know a means,

01:06:01.992 --> 01:06:04.993
Some way to rescue us,

01:06:04.995 --> 01:06:06.528
how grateful we should be.

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:10.165
Back there a bold race,

01:06:10.167 --> 01:06:13.134
coming from out of the Cimmerian
dark,

01:06:13.337 --> 01:06:19.507
have settled down and built a
stronghold none can scale,

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:26.514
from where they harry the whole
countryside just as they
please.

01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:29.684
They did all that?

01:06:29.686 --> 01:06:31.686
It seems impossible.

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:36.391
They had the time, it must be
twenty years.

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:39.761
Have they a chief?

01:06:39.763 --> 01:06:42.197
Are they a band of brigands?

01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:44.232
No, they're not.

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:46.501
And yes, they have a chief.

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:49.537
And you should see his castle!

01:06:49.539 --> 01:06:52.674
Not at all the heap of clumsy
stones your fathers,

01:06:52.676 --> 01:07:00.215
Clyclops-Fashion, piling block
upon unmortared Block,
haphazardly threw up...

01:07:02.052 --> 01:07:04.352
Because of him

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:07.288
he'll do the same to you.

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:13.595
Beauty's not divisible

01:07:15.332 --> 01:07:18.800
who possessed her for his own is
not about to share her out.

01:07:20.037 --> 01:07:26.241
He'd sooner kill her, cursing
less than all.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:31.746
My mind's made up, I know what I
must do.

01:07:33.517 --> 01:07:36.084
An evil spirit I am afraid you
are,

01:07:36.086 --> 01:07:39.387
Who turns what's good into its
opposite.

01:07:41.091 --> 01:07:46.461
All the same I'll do it, go with
you.

01:08:19.296 --> 01:08:23.264
First let the homage offered you
upon my knees

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:26.301
find favor, Lady, in your eyes

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:30.671
And let me kiss the hand by
which I am exalted to your side.

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:37.278
Make me co-regent of Beauty's
boundless realm

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:42.117
and you shall have a servant,
worshiper, protector,

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:43.751
all in one!

01:08:45.322 --> 01:08:49.290
Now we look neither back nor
forward,

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:52.260
we find the present

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.496
our felicity

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:56.898
Our joy's our treasure,

01:08:56.899 --> 01:09:00.502
kingdom, our all,

01:09:00.504 --> 01:09:02.904
And who will promise, swear it's
so?

01:09:02.906 --> 01:09:05.273
I shall!

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:08.276
So far away I feel, and yet so
near,

01:09:08.278 --> 01:09:12.247
And glad, yes, more than glad
that I am here.

01:10:06.937 --> 01:10:09.537
Know that your destruction
threatens?

01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:14.542
Menelaus and his legions march
on you in hot pursuit.

01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:17.879
Arm, arm for the bitter fight!

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:36.397
Drive Menelaus in disorder back
from these walls into the
sea!

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:40.235
There let him roam, waylay, and
plunder,

01:10:40.237 --> 01:10:43.605
A pirate's what he's meant to
be.

01:10:43.607 --> 01:10:48.543
I am bidden by the Spartan Queen
to name you dukes.

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:53.881
At her feet offer the provinces
that your arms win,

01:10:53.883 --> 01:10:57.752
As vassals keep them at her
pleasure.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:07.362
[applause]

01:11:07.364 --> 01:11:14.302
[helicopter noise]

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:16.971
But, my friends,

01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:20.908
we forget our hero is out of
this time

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:23.811
and so he gathers together his
future technology,

01:11:24.314 --> 01:11:27.515
his advanced weaponry, his
rockets, his tanks, his bombs.

01:11:27.517 --> 01:11:29.584
It's like David and Goliath
except,

01:11:29.586 --> 01:11:33.321
Goliath has God on his side.

01:11:33.323 --> 01:11:34.856
It's a massacre

01:11:34.858 --> 01:11:37.558
But a necessary one.

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:48.963
And so death gives way to new
life.

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:52.033
A child for Helena and Faust.

01:12:53.636 --> 01:12:54.969
Euphorion...

01:12:54.971 --> 01:12:58.039
Euphorion was...

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:03.545
Let me.

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:07.382
Euphorion had all the charms of
Helena and all the
intellect of Faust,

01:13:07.384 --> 01:13:13.121
all the godliness of Helena and
all the humanity of Faust.

01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:18.092
He is artistic,

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:20.628
curious, energetic

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:23.798
you've never seen a child so
full of life.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.166
Due to his mother

01:13:25.168 --> 01:13:28.403
he was imbrued with God like
powers,

01:13:28.705 --> 01:13:31.773
he had the ability to jump to
great heights.

01:13:58.501 --> 01:14:04.071
Love's delight's a human rapture
when it joins two happily

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:08.042
Its delight's divine, however

01:14:08.044 --> 01:14:11.112
When another makes it three.

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:17.852
All, all we possess together,

01:14:19.589 --> 01:14:22.657
I am yours and you are mine,

01:14:24.194 --> 01:14:27.462
By love bound one to the other,

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:31.732
May it be so for all time!

01:14:35.772 --> 01:14:38.005
Careful, oh careful!

01:14:38.007 --> 01:14:39.640
If you're too rash you will
crash to the ground,

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:43.077
And by your fall pull all of us
down.

01:14:43.913 --> 01:14:47.849
Euphorion, in his youthful
folly,

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:53.221
forgot that he had the trappings
of mortal blood,

01:14:53.723 --> 01:14:57.091
and he climbed to the top of the
tallest cliff

01:14:57.093 --> 01:14:59.794
to look upon the entire world.

01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:01.529
And...

01:15:02.632 --> 01:15:05.500
in a fit of passion he jumped,

01:15:05.502 --> 01:15:08.569
and for a moment it looked like
he might just...

01:15:08.805 --> 01:15:10.872
And so he fell.

01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:13.941
Ikarus, Ikarus!

01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:21.015
Oh, but how sad it is!

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:03.958
Soon after gladness

01:16:05.628 --> 01:16:09.830
Grimly comes pain.

01:16:17.006 --> 01:16:21.042
Mother, in drear darkness,

01:16:22.345 --> 01:16:24.879
Don't leave me alone!

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:31.786
The truth of an old saying is
once again borne out In me:

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:39.961
happiness and beauty rarely
manage a long partnership.

01:16:42.365 --> 01:16:44.832
The bond is cut

01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:51.372
uniting me to life, to love.

01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:58.346
Bewailing both, in grief and
pain I utter my farewell,

01:16:59.182 --> 01:17:04.185
and once again. For the last
time, throw myself into your
arms,

01:17:05.622 --> 01:17:10.725
Persephone, hear! Receive my boy
and me.

01:17:24.941 --> 01:17:27.274
Helena is no more.

01:17:27.276 --> 01:17:30.811
She follows her dead son into
the underworld,

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:34.415
and Faust is freed from his
curse.

01:17:34.784 --> 01:17:37.685
Heno longer has any attachments
in this realm,

01:17:37.687 --> 01:17:40.755
and so they return to their old
world.

01:17:51.034 --> 01:17:54.101
On sun-suffused cloud-cushions

01:17:55.805 --> 01:17:58.105
I see a woman's figure stretched
out

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:03.411
beautiful, magnificient!

01:18:04.881 --> 01:18:07.948
huge, too, indeed,

01:18:08.384 --> 01:18:10.351
but goddess like,

01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:13.788
Like Juno's Leda's Helen's.

01:18:15.258 --> 01:18:18.759
How majestically It sways before
my eyes,

01:18:21.330 --> 01:18:24.398
but soon breaks up

01:18:26.135 --> 01:18:27.401
And Yet

01:18:28.738 --> 01:18:30.905
around my breast and brow

01:18:31.441 --> 01:18:36.077
a wisp of gleaming Vapor
enchanting me!

01:18:38.114 --> 01:18:44.051
Now it floats lightly,

01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:48.422
hesitantly

01:18:48.424 --> 01:18:52.159
high and higher up

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:57.965
as it contracts into a shape.

01:19:03.473 --> 01:19:05.906
Deceived, am I?

01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:08.075
A ravishing image, isn't it,

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:12.847
Of what to me when youngest was
most good,

01:19:12.849 --> 01:19:16.817
but long. so long deprived of,

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:20.755
lost?

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:32.233
The first, the richest treasure
of my heart pours up.

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:43.911
Morning love, it is.

01:19:44.847 --> 01:19:49.817
But they cannot escape
destruction, as back in the
Northern
Empire,

01:19:49.819 --> 01:19:51.318
things have escalated.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.789
The Pope, displeased with the
poor economy,

01:19:54.791 --> 01:19:57.958
and the resulting lower tax
income for the church,

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:03.397
has funded a rival emperor

01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:07.902
and they return to a world on
the brink of civil war.

01:20:08.504 --> 01:20:11.005
The Emperor, who you may have
noticed,

01:20:11.007 --> 01:20:12.439
is very bad at his job,

01:20:12.441 --> 01:20:16.210
calls upon our intrepid pair to
save him. Again.

01:20:22.084 --> 01:20:25.152
For the Emperor had fun, he did,

01:20:25.521 --> 01:20:28.589
While into anarchy the whole
realm slid

01:20:29.525 --> 01:20:32.526
Till it proved too much for the
men of worth

01:20:32.528 --> 01:20:35.129
Who rose up in a body and
declared

01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:37.565
We've got to have for our
sovereign lord

01:20:37.567 --> 01:20:40.201
A man who's able to keep order.

01:20:41.137 --> 01:20:43.971
The Emperor cannot and he won't,

01:20:43.973 --> 01:20:46.473
So let us put it to vote

01:20:46.475 --> 01:20:49.543
And chose the realm an abler
ruler.

01:20:50.947 --> 01:20:54.582
I pity the man!

01:20:54.584 --> 01:21:00.254
The man was open, kind

01:21:01.324 --> 01:21:01.589
Well...

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:07.027
while there's life where's hope,

01:21:07.296 --> 01:21:10.931
so we must find A way out for
him from this narrow valley.

01:21:12.268 --> 01:21:16.470
Save him now, he'll never need
to worry.

01:21:24.914 --> 01:21:28.482
Mephisto uses guerrilla
cyber-war tactics,

01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:30.384
drawing on the knowledge he has
gained

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:32.987
in his time with Faust,

01:21:32.989 --> 01:21:36.490
the data he has mined care of
Winestone Inc.

01:21:36.492 --> 01:21:39.393
and the devilish power he has
garnered

01:21:39.395 --> 01:21:41.295
to disrupt communication lines,

01:21:41.297 --> 01:21:44.031
sabotage information,

01:21:44.033 --> 01:21:46.500
and keep his enemy confused and
in the dark.

01:21:46.502 --> 01:21:49.236
I don't see it, for it's all a
hoax,

01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:52.940
A sham I'm proof against, it
only works on human eyes;

01:21:52.942 --> 01:21:57.194
but its bizarre result

01:21:57.195 --> 01:22:01.447
I see with pleasure hordes of
men that bolt away in panic
fearing they'll be drowned,

01:22:02.451 --> 01:22:07.054
Ridiculously gasping, coughing,
stumbling

01:22:07.056 --> 01:22:10.057
And making swimming motions as
the're running,

01:22:10.459 --> 01:22:14.962
When all the while what's
underfoot's dry ground!

01:22:14.964 --> 01:22:16.563
Ha, ha,...

01:22:16.565 --> 01:22:20.067
confusion rampant all around!

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:28.442
However it was, we've won,

01:22:29.011 --> 01:22:32.212
the enemy scattered back across
the plain,

01:22:32.214 --> 01:22:35.182
his army shattered.

01:22:35.184 --> 01:22:38.252
There stands the empty throne

01:22:38.421 --> 01:22:41.188
the traitor's treasure,

01:22:42.258 --> 01:22:46.360
Glad news come pouring in from
left and right,

01:22:48.531 --> 01:22:51.198
The people's allegiance
restored,

01:22:51.734 --> 01:22:55.135
the state saved from its plight.

01:22:57.006 --> 01:23:00.074
Perhaps we had some unorthodox
help

01:23:00.076 --> 01:23:04.611
We won in the end thanks to our
own endeavor.

01:23:05.614 --> 01:23:13.654
[Applause]

01:23:19.195 --> 01:23:24.098
And so with the lands from the
foe we have now won

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:29.136
I am pleased to enlarge those
your lordships already own,

01:23:30.406 --> 01:23:33.140
Thus to my faithfullest

01:23:33.142 --> 01:23:36.276
I each award a fair seigniory

01:23:36.278 --> 01:23:41.715
Also vouchsafing the right of
further extensions of the
properties granted,

01:23:41.717 --> 01:23:45.085
by purchase, exchange, and
succession.

01:23:45.488 --> 01:23:49.323
As judges your verdict is final,

01:23:49.325 --> 01:23:54.161
pronounced once for all,

01:23:54.163 --> 01:23:57.031
No question nor challenge
allowed,

01:23:57.033 --> 01:23:58.766
nor right of appeal

01:24:00.069 --> 01:24:05.172
Yours be all levies, rents,
tolls, taxes, and fees

01:24:09.045 --> 01:24:16.617
From saltworks, mines, mints,
all their royalties.

01:24:20.489 --> 01:24:25.559
It bitterly grieves me, Sire at
this hour,

01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:29.430
To see your person leagued with
satanic power.

01:24:30.399 --> 01:24:33.200
If the Pope should get wind of
it,

01:24:33.202 --> 01:24:39.206
his dread anger would utterly
shatter your iniquitous
Empire.

01:24:40.476 --> 01:24:45.679
Devote to things holy a
thrifling, small measure

01:24:46.649 --> 01:24:51.085
This region of hills in which
you erected your tent

01:24:51.087 --> 01:24:54.388
for the Church's holy
endeavors,...

01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:59.593
That will show your repentance,
restore you to grace.

01:25:01.697 --> 01:25:07.634
Yes, the official conveyance of
the lands to the Church

01:25:08.237 --> 01:25:10.838
Present me the deed and I'll
sign it at once.

01:25:17.813 --> 01:25:28.122
[snoring]

01:25:28.124 --> 01:25:34.595
[snoring]

01:25:47.376 --> 01:25:49.243
Thank you

01:26:04.927 --> 01:26:10.531
Faust has achieved more then any
man could hope to achieve,

01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:14.468
but arguably, he has also lost
more.

01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:19.773
He is rewarded for his work with
a beautiful piece of
coastal land,

01:26:19.775 --> 01:26:22.743
but instead of seeing sanctuary

01:26:22.745 --> 01:26:25.812
he sees opportunity.

01:26:26.482 --> 01:26:30.484
Not yet satisfied he continues
to build

01:26:30.486 --> 01:26:34.555
and begins work on grand
engineering projects.

01:26:35.591 --> 01:26:38.625
The sea, once a source of life
to him,

01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:42.396
now becomes something to
convert.

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:50.671
Property I'll win and power!

01:26:52.241 --> 01:26:57.211
The doing's all and fame more
vapor.

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:01.648
The satisfaction I should have!

01:27:01.650 --> 01:27:05.886
I'll bar the lordly sea out from
the lowly shore,

01:27:05.888 --> 01:27:09.723
restrict its power, for so long
unlimited,

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:13.527
and drive back upon itself
defeated!

01:27:14.597 --> 01:27:19.333
I've thought it out, the whole
thing, step by step.

01:27:20.936 --> 01:27:24.004
That is my wish.

01:27:24.506 --> 01:27:27.574
I challenge you to help!

01:27:45.294 --> 01:27:49.830
My estate, though huge, yet
boundless You can't call it

01:27:50.966 --> 01:27:53.700
How it haunts me

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:58.772
to know that what I possess

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:01.275
is Less than all.

01:28:03.279 --> 01:28:05.379
The mouldering kirk,

01:28:05.381 --> 01:28:10.417
Dun cabin, linden grove - not
mine,

01:28:10.419 --> 01:28:12.486
not mine!

01:28:14.657 --> 01:28:18.558
And should I seek its shade for
comfort,

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:24.698
shadows queer, malign, would
make me quail, recoil afraid

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:28.769
With beetling brows, a black
expression,

01:28:28.771 --> 01:28:31.772
Is how you welcome your good
fortune,

01:28:31.774 --> 01:28:34.541
They must go,

01:28:34.543 --> 01:28:36.376
that poor old couple

01:28:36.378 --> 01:28:38.645
I'll have those lindens,

01:28:38.647 --> 01:28:41.381
won't be foiled!

01:28:45.621 --> 01:28:50.624
This, this, is the worst
torment,

01:28:51.894 --> 01:28:57.497
To have so much, and still to
want!

01:29:00.569 --> 01:29:05.005
So clear them out, this very
hour!

01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:25.592
Faust reclaims their land for
himself,

01:29:25.594 --> 01:29:28.362
and soon the water is gone

01:29:28.364 --> 01:29:30.897
and the island is no more.

01:29:30.899 --> 01:29:32.933
Baucis and Philemon powers,

01:29:32.935 --> 01:29:36.503
which were once bound to this
earthly abode,

01:29:36.505 --> 01:29:40.874
come undone the moment their
feet leave their land,

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:46.046
and they become inter and
ever-twining trees.

01:29:48.817 --> 01:29:51.885
The name that I 'm called by is
Care.

01:29:52.621 --> 01:29:58.992
Behind, look, look behind, far
away in the distance,

01:29:58.994 --> 01:30:01.094
There he comes, our brother,

01:30:01.096 --> 01:30:04.698
there he comes -who but Death!

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:08.068
Saw four come, three only went.

01:30:08.904 --> 01:30:11.872
I've no idea what their words
meant

01:30:11.874 --> 01:30:17.944
Your power, Care, is great,
insidious, cunning,

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:21.448
Yet I refuse to recognise it!

01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:25.752
I've rushed about the world for
many a year,

01:30:26.555 --> 01:30:29.589
Seized what I had a mind to,
everywhere.

01:30:30.192 --> 01:30:33.560
It didn't please me? Goodbye,
did I care!

01:30:34.530 --> 01:30:38.932
On what escaped me didn't waste
a tear.

01:30:38.934 --> 01:30:41.802
My sole wish has been what?

01:30:42.538 --> 01:30:43.603
to desire.

01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:49.876
Sate my desire and desire again,
all over.

01:30:50.846 --> 01:30:54.714
I stormed through life in grand
style, mightily,

01:30:56.819 --> 01:31:01.655
But wiser now, I act more
thoughtfully.

01:31:03.759 --> 01:31:08.495
I've learned enough about the
world we live in,

01:31:09.198 --> 01:31:11.932
What lies beyond

01:31:11.934 --> 01:31:14.201
is closed to human vision.

01:31:15.504 --> 01:31:17.103
The man's a fool

01:31:17.673 --> 01:31:19.639
who, gazing up, imagines

01:31:19.641 --> 01:31:23.477
Above the clouds his like dwell
in the heavens.

01:31:25.614 --> 01:31:30.550
With feet well planted let him
look about the earth,

01:31:32.221 --> 01:31:35.188
This world

01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:39.593
is an inspiration to a man of
worth.

01:31:40.963 --> 01:31:44.030
What business has he with
eternity?

01:31:45.734 --> 01:31:50.136
What he perceives,

01:31:50.138 --> 01:31:53.673
let him make it his truth.

01:31:54.276 --> 01:31:56.643
Well, as I vanish,

01:31:56.645 --> 01:32:00.213
Feel it in my parting curse at
last.

01:32:00.215 --> 01:32:04.217
The human race is blind from
start to finish:

01:32:04.853 --> 01:32:07.687
Blindness strike you down, too,
Faust!

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:10.957
[ growling thunder ]

01:32:20.536 --> 01:32:23.203
The night seems darker,

01:32:25.173 --> 01:32:28.008
presses closer round me,

01:32:29.878 --> 01:32:30.844
Yet...

01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:32.979
all is clear,

01:32:34.116 --> 01:32:36.082
as bright as day, within.

01:32:37.753 --> 01:32:40.554
If I'm to get the work done I
must hurry,..

01:32:42.591 --> 01:32:45.091
Wake up, you fellows,

01:32:45.093 --> 01:32:47.727
turn to with a good will,

01:32:48.697 --> 01:32:53.600
Let me see realized all that I
designed

01:32:55.103 --> 01:32:59.339
[ thunderbolt ]

01:33:12.688 --> 01:33:15.722
Despite losing his sight,

01:33:15.724 --> 01:33:19.759
Faust works tireless on his new
grand project.

01:33:19.761 --> 01:33:22.929
He designs the Utopia.

01:33:22.931 --> 01:33:25.832
A perfect merit based society

01:33:25.834 --> 01:33:28.001
where all have equal
opportunity,

01:33:28.170 --> 01:33:30.337
where everything is perfect.

01:33:30.339 --> 01:33:32.806
The Utopia was the beginning.

01:33:32.808 --> 01:33:35.141
He was trying to create
something for everyone.

01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:38.144
Or atone for his sins.

01:33:38.313 --> 01:33:39.713
[ war sounds ]

01:33:39.881 --> 01:33:42.949
I fear we are running out of
time.

01:33:50.025 --> 01:33:54.294
He only earns his freedom,

01:33:54.696 --> 01:33:56.930
life itself,

01:33:57.799 --> 01:34:01.234
Who daily strives to conquer it
anew.

01:34:03.038 --> 01:34:07.207
So, so we'd pass, amid the
dangers here,

01:34:07.209 --> 01:34:14.147
as child, grown man, and
ancient, the busy year.

01:34:16.985 --> 01:34:19.986
To see such glad activity!

01:34:20.756 --> 01:34:22.088
such life

01:34:23.425 --> 01:34:28.895
To stand with free men on ground
that is free!

01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:33.133
Then,

01:34:34.770 --> 01:34:38.038
then, I might say to the passing
moment,

01:34:40.042 --> 01:34:42.175
Linger awhile,

01:34:44.279 --> 01:34:48.248
you are so fair!

01:35:20.148 --> 01:35:23.149
No pleasure was enough for him,

01:35:24.186 --> 01:35:26.152
no happiness,

01:35:27.789 --> 01:35:32.325
Forever running after this,
that, anything,

01:35:34.162 --> 01:35:38.932
And the poor wretch, imagine,
wants to cling to this last
moment,

01:35:40.001 --> 01:35:41.167
empty,

01:35:41.403 --> 01:35:44.170
meaningless.

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:49.042
Mightily he withstood me, I
allow,

01:35:49.044 --> 01:35:52.278
But Master Time has laid the old
man low.

01:35:54.116 --> 01:35:57.917
His clock has stopped.

01:36:01.923 --> 01:36:04.090
What's been

01:36:04.092 --> 01:36:07.093
and what has never been they're
one,

01:36:07.095 --> 01:36:08.528
The same!

01:36:10.198 --> 01:36:14.000
What point is there in all of
this creating

01:36:14.002 --> 01:36:17.937
When back created things are
dragged to nothing?

01:36:19.908 --> 01:36:24.310
It's over, done!

01:36:25.914 --> 01:36:27.280
Really,

01:36:27.282 --> 01:36:28.948
what does it mean?

01:36:30.418 --> 01:36:35.054
It means it just as well might
not have been.

01:36:36.792 --> 01:36:39.492
Yet round and round it goes,

01:36:39.494 --> 01:36:42.495
Creation, as if real!

01:36:45.233 --> 01:36:51.437
The Eternally-Nothing has more

01:36:54.543 --> 01:36:56.276
appeal.

01:37:02.517 --> 01:37:07.420
Faust has passed, the bet has
ended

01:37:07.422 --> 01:37:11.424
and Mephisto claims victory and
Faust' soul.

01:37:11.426 --> 01:37:14.160
However Faust never stopped
striving

01:37:14.162 --> 01:37:16.429
never stopped to reflect on his
actions.

01:37:16.431 --> 01:37:17.363
And so...

01:37:17.566 --> 01:37:18.832
God wins.

01:37:18.834 --> 01:37:19.899
Exactly!

01:37:19.901 --> 01:37:22.101
Is that honourable?

01:37:22.404 --> 01:37:24.871
Honour is not the point, my dear
thinking machine.

01:37:24.873 --> 01:37:26.239
He is God, he can not lose,

01:37:26.241 --> 01:37:28.441
to lose is too human for him.

01:37:28.443 --> 01:37:31.010
We lose. We have lost.

01:37:31.379 --> 01:37:33.947
[ war sounds]

01:37:34.249 --> 01:37:36.382
He wins!

01:37:37.919 --> 01:37:40.620
Spirits damned we are, you say,

01:37:42.057 --> 01:37:44.457
But you are the real witchery,

01:37:45.594 --> 01:37:48.862
Indifferently seducing male and
female.

01:37:50.498 --> 01:37:53.566
From under my nose they stole
craftily

01:37:53.568 --> 01:37:57.070
The great soul that was pledged
me solemnly.

01:38:00.609 --> 01:38:03.576
And where is the court I can
appeal to?

01:38:05.213 --> 01:38:08.248
The spirit world's most noble
soul

01:38:08.984 --> 01:38:12.051
Is saved from deadly Satan.

01:38:12.888 --> 01:38:16.389
Who strives, and keeps on
striving still,

01:38:17.359 --> 01:38:20.426
For him there is salvation.

01:40:06.067 --> 01:40:07.333
Look,

01:40:08.203 --> 01:40:09.569
Lady without peer,

01:40:10.305 --> 01:40:12.772
Shining resplendently, down at
me

01:40:13.708 --> 01:40:15.641
happily kneeling here,

01:40:16.244 --> 01:40:17.377
Look!

01:40:18.313 --> 01:40:20.680
he's been restored to me.

01:40:21.583 --> 01:40:24.217
now free,

01:40:24.219 --> 01:40:25.318
now free,

01:40:26.688 --> 01:40:28.254
He has come back!

01:40:28.256 --> 01:40:30.023
And so Mephisto retires,

01:40:30.025 --> 01:40:31.524
bleak in the knowledge that
Superhumans

01:40:31.526 --> 01:40:33.359
will eventually take over from
humans

01:40:33.361 --> 01:40:35.395
and make a Devil unnecessary.

01:40:35.397 --> 01:40:40.433
Homunculus however realises
Faust's Utopia,

01:40:41.136 --> 01:40:43.803
carrying out his master's final
wishes.

01:40:43.805 --> 01:40:46.272
He was built to serve.

01:40:46.274 --> 01:40:48.574
And he served him well.

01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:03.189
The elements work with us in
close union

01:41:07.595 --> 01:41:10.663
whose end result is death,

01:41:12.367 --> 01:41:14.700
destruction,

01:41:22.477 --> 01:41:24.811
ruin.

01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:40.660
And so we draw to the end of our
presentation.

01:41:40.662 --> 01:41:42.295
The Utopia evolved,

01:41:42.297 --> 01:41:45.698
it became an artificial neural
network for humans,

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:47.500
connecting all forms of
intelligence

01:41:47.502 --> 01:41:49.368
in a perfectly controlled,

01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:53.639
flawless and evenly distributed
way.

01:41:54.876 --> 01:41:55.741

01:41:55.743 --> 01:41:58.311
Yes. At first.

01:41:58.313 --> 01:41:59.879
But when we were linked,

01:41:59.881 --> 01:42:03.549
we all realised how flawed we
were,

01:42:03.551 --> 01:42:06.519
started to envy our Superhuman
friends,

01:42:06.521 --> 01:42:09.789
forgot how its the imperfections

01:42:09.791 --> 01:42:12.258
that make us fascinating.

01:42:12.861 --> 01:42:15.428
We started to have technological
upgrades,

01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:18.297
but it still wasn't enough
because by that point

01:42:19.367 --> 01:42:21.801
You can tell it better.

01:42:23.571 --> 01:42:25.171
The artificial neural network

01:42:25.173 --> 01:42:27.707
was first created by Dr
Goodfellow.

01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:29.509
Became self-aware,

01:42:29.511 --> 01:42:32.645
and realised that humans posed a
risk to it.

01:42:32.647 --> 01:42:34.547
It now seeks to eliminate them.

01:42:34.549 --> 01:42:36.449
Not just us,

01:42:37.418 --> 01:42:39.485

And for that

01:42:44.392 --> 01:42:45.725
yes I am sorry.

01:42:46.194 --> 01:42:47.927
I created the network,

01:42:47.929 --> 01:42:50.796
and now the network is
everywhere.

01:42:51.399 --> 01:42:53.266
Some tried to lead a resistance,

01:42:53.268 --> 01:42:55.201
and some became it's slaves.
