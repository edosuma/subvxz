So, he gave me the play,which I adored,

09:35.074 --> 09:38.369
and it worked withmy schedule, so.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.578
Beautiful.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.706
Can you tell us a little bitabout Shadow of Death?

09:41.747 --> 09:46.335
It's an old-fashioned drawingroom murder mystery,

09:46.377 --> 09:49.005
with a little romance thrown infor good measure.

09:49.046 --> 09:51.132
A romance with your character?

09:51.173 --> 09:54.427
Yes, um, she fallsfor the local vicar,

09:54.468 --> 09:58.472
played by that handsome manover there, Elliot Quirk.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.808
Quirk as in Quirk Construction,the new condos?

10:00.808 --> 10:01.767
Mmhmm.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.644
When he donated lumberfor the set,

10:03.644 --> 10:05.730
he got bit by the acting bug.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.898
And, by Bella Brightman.

10:07.940 --> 10:08.983
[laughs]

10:09.025 --> 10:09.984
It's understandable.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.652
How's her husbandfeel about that?

10:11.652 --> 10:15.114
Well, let's just say he's beencoming to a lot of rehearsals.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.907
Uh-huh.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.578
Hey Chief, how's your daughter?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.413
She's awake, and smiling.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.456
Bud's there.

10:23.497 --> 10:24.498
Okay. That's good.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.250
And she's still fuzzyon what happened.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.376
The doctor said give hersome time,

10:27.418 --> 10:28.502
and it'll all come back.

10:28.544 --> 10:29.378
All right.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.421
You got any leads?

10:30.463 --> 10:31.589
No.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.841
There's so many fingerprintsin a place like that.

10:33.841 --> 10:36.635
I don't know, maybe we geta hit on one?

10:36.677 --> 10:38.304
Yeah. Okay, good.

10:41.015 --> 10:41.932
Hey.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.267
Hey.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.560
You made it.

10:44.602 --> 10:45.853
Yeah, visiting hours ended.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.355
Look, are... are you gonna beable to help Travis

10:47.396 --> 10:49.148
figure out who did thisto Claire?

10:49.190 --> 10:50.191
Well, if he asks me to,

10:50.191 --> 10:51.859
but I'm not going to holdmy breath.

10:51.901 --> 10:52.902
You know how he is.

10:52.943 --> 10:53.986
Hey Karl.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.363
What... what happened?

10:55.404 --> 10:56.530
What does it look like?

10:56.572 --> 10:59.367
Chair broke. Gotta fix it.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.534
You need a hand with that,Karl?

11:00.576 --> 11:02.745
From you, the star's husband?No.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.248
Amy? Uh, questionfor you onstage?

11:06.290 --> 11:07.124
Yeah. Sure.

11:07.166 --> 11:07.958
I'll talk to you later.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.210
Okay.

11:09.251 --> 11:12.046
[whispering] I just need youto back me up on this. Okay?

11:12.088 --> 11:13.881
Elliot.

11:13.923 --> 11:19.387
Elliot has a thought aboutthe vicar confessing his love.

11:19.428 --> 11:23.474
So, I was thinkingI should kiss her.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.394
No.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.354
No, absolutely not.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.232
[stutters] But, I'm in lovewith her, Amy.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.067
And we're finallyalone together.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.777
Okay, but you're a vicar.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.404
You're a man of propriety,you know.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.573
You respect the rulesof courtship.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.450
I mean, and bottom line,

11:41.492 --> 11:43.077
this script doesn't indicatea kiss.

11:43.119 --> 11:46.163
I'm... I'm sorry, Elliot.

11:46.205 --> 11:49.583
Oh, darling, you tried.

11:49.583 --> 11:50.918
All right everyone.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.754
This is our last run-throughbefore we have an audience,

11:53.754 --> 11:55.715
so let's get ready.

11:55.756 --> 11:56.674
Poor Elliot.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.343
Mm. I met his girlfriend today.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.386
Poor girlfriend.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.679
[laughs]

12:01.721 --> 12:03.431
I know, it's pretty obvioushe's smitten with Bella, right?

12:03.472 --> 12:04.557
Yeah.

12:04.598 --> 12:05.266
[sighs]

12:05.266 --> 12:06.684
I think her husband knows.

12:06.725 --> 12:10.604
I mean, this is the third nightDuncan's been here this week.

12:11.897 --> 12:14.984
Once the show is over,I'm sure he'll move on.

12:15.025 --> 12:17.361
Bella certainly will.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.450
(Travis) There she is.

12:22.491 --> 12:23.951
Hi, partner.

12:23.993 --> 12:24.660
Hey, you.

12:24.702 --> 12:25.494
Thank you.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.579
How you feeling?

12:26.620 --> 12:27.997
Like a rookie.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.081
I should've called for backup

12:29.123 --> 12:30.958
as soon as I sawthe glass was broken.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.126
You will next time.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.170
Hey. I'm sorry it took meso long to get here.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.963
You're working a case,I understand.

12:36.005 --> 12:36.839
Any headway?

12:36.881 --> 12:38.591
No, not yet.

12:38.632 --> 12:39.800
In fact, I was hoping

12:39.842 --> 12:43.304
that you were startingto remember some things.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.722
Yeah, actually.

12:44.764 --> 12:45.473
Yeah?

12:45.514 --> 12:47.057
There was this,this sound,

12:47.099 --> 12:50.436
like this steady rhythm comingfrom the back of the store.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.355
I went toward it, and...

12:53.397 --> 12:55.232
it was one of those littletoy monkeys

12:55.274 --> 12:56.775
that plays the cymbals.

12:56.817 --> 12:57.777
That's weird.

12:57.818 --> 12:58.694
Yeah.

12:58.736 --> 12:59.403
Huh.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.322
Anything else?

13:01.322 --> 13:03.574
No, sorry.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.742
It's all right.

13:04.783 --> 13:08.788
Uh, enjoy the flowersand I'll see you tomorrow.

13:08.829 --> 13:09.580
Sounds good.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.416
All right. Heal up, get better.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.084
Vicar.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.462
Whatever can this mean?

13:16.504 --> 13:21.509
I suppose it means I love you,Lady Purcell.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.844
Vicar!

13:23.844 --> 13:24.803
[screams]

13:24.845 --> 13:26.972
Lacy, that's your cue.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.641
I know. I'm sorry, Vincent.

13:28.682 --> 13:32.603
I'm pulling the trigger,but nothing's happening.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.355
Bud?

13:34.396 --> 13:35.397
[stammering] I loaded it,

13:35.439 --> 13:36.774
I don't knowwhat's going on.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.526
Vincent, this thing'sin really bad shape.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.570
I got a newer one at home,it'll fire on cue.

13:41.612 --> 13:42.655
All right, thanks Karl.

13:42.696 --> 13:43.364
Okay, everyone.

13:43.405 --> 13:44.657
Let's just keep going.

13:44.698 --> 13:48.369
As I've told you many times,inspector,

13:48.369 --> 13:51.121
never underestimatea lady.

13:51.163 --> 13:54.041
[enthusiastic clapping]Bravo!

13:54.041 --> 13:55.751
Bravo!

13:55.793 --> 13:56.710
Can I help you?

13:56.710 --> 13:58.420
I'm sorry, sir.We're not open yet.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.005
Sebastian?

14:00.047 --> 14:01.549
Heya, Bells.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.008
I brought you your favourites.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.552
Heya, Sebastian.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.303
Vincent, can you please...

14:06.345 --> 14:07.054
Get off me, man.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.180
Do you know who this guy is?

14:08.222 --> 14:09.390
He's Bella's ex.

14:09.431 --> 14:10.391
How'd you know that?

14:10.432 --> 14:12.560
Yeah, how did you know that?

14:12.560 --> 14:15.563
Well, I meanit's pretty obvious.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.440
He called her "Bells" andhe brought her her favourites

14:18.482 --> 14:21.652
from a bakery that only existsin Manhattan,

14:21.694 --> 14:23.237
and I'm sure they're fresh,right?

14:23.279 --> 14:24.446
Mmhmm.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.073
So you just arrived, andby the look on your face,

14:26.115 --> 14:27.741
I could tell there was someunfinished business

14:27.741 --> 14:28.826
between you two,

14:28.868 --> 14:31.245
and it's obvious that Bellais not happy.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.246
[clapping]

14:32.246 --> 14:34.456
Well done, Detective WhoeverYou Are.

14:34.498 --> 14:35.332
She is good.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.125
Amy Winslow.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.167
Ah.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.087
Sebastian Dusquenes.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.423
Bella's first husband.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.302
[clears throat]

14:46.343 --> 14:49.263
Let me guess, you came hereto win her back.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.974
No, I'm just a fan of her work.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.267
[chuckles]Okay.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.269
All right, well, you can bea fan of her work tomorrow

14:55.269 --> 14:56.395
when we open.

14:57.771 --> 15:01.567
Love what I saw tonight, Bells.Can't wait for more.

15:01.609 --> 15:02.443
Okay.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.402
[clears throat]

15:03.444 --> 15:06.530
Goodnight, Sebastian.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.453
Okay.

15:12.494 --> 15:16.332
Now that our unwanted guestis gone,

15:16.373 --> 15:17.791
let's gather for notes.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.419
Yes, yes, notes.

15:25.299 --> 15:33.766
[suspenseful music]♪

15:37.519 --> 15:39.772
(Bella) There's no need to get upset, Karl.

15:39.813 --> 15:40.606
I'm not a fool.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.857
I know why he's here.

15:41.899 --> 15:46.612
He has no idea, but he will,if you don't handle it.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.031
So handle it.

15:49.073 --> 15:53.243
[suspenseful music]♪

15:53.285 --> 15:55.371
[screams]Ahhhhh!!!!!

15:55.412 --> 15:57.164
Shh! Are you okay?

15:57.164 --> 15:57.915
What's wrong?

15:57.956 --> 15:59.291
Sorry, Professor Winslow.

15:59.333 --> 16:03.170
I... I was just eavesdropping,I guess, on Karl and Bella,

16:03.212 --> 16:07.508
and their conversationsounded... strange.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.176
Strange how?

16:09.218 --> 16:11.637
He was upset that someonewas there, but she said

16:11.679 --> 16:15.683
"he has no idea, but he willif you don't handle this."

16:15.683 --> 16:18.727
And then she paused, like reallydramatically, and said

16:18.769 --> 16:21.146
"so handle it."

16:21.188 --> 16:24.108
And then I kind of gasped,and Karl heard me,

16:24.149 --> 16:25.693
so I scooted away in here.

16:25.734 --> 16:28.487
"Handle it." Hmm.

16:28.529 --> 16:32.741
Do you think Karl was talkingabout her ex-husband showing up?

16:32.783 --> 16:35.077
I think he was talking abouther current husband.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.954
I don't think he's happyDuncan's here.

16:36.995 --> 16:40.207
So what does Karl not wantDuncan to find out about?

16:40.207 --> 16:41.542
I don't know.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.252
Okay, but what's going on?

16:43.293 --> 16:45.379
It does remind me ofA Study in Scarlet.

16:45.379 --> 16:47.715
That great line that Holmes has?

16:47.756 --> 16:50.509
"There's nothing likefirsthand evidence."

16:50.551 --> 16:52.386
Which we have none of,right now.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.887
It's just a bunch ofguess work.

16:53.929 --> 16:54.722
[sighs]

16:54.763 --> 16:56.306
No, you're right.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.516
Sorry for screaming.

16:57.558 --> 16:58.225
[laughs]

16:58.267 --> 17:00.394
That's okay.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.062
Hey, do you need a ride home?

17:02.104 --> 17:02.938
That would be great.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.522
Okay, come on.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.733
What a rehearsal, huh?

17:05.733 --> 17:09.111
Yeah, I'll say.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.070
Oh, hello again.

17:11.070 --> 17:13.615
This is one of my students,Lacy Daniels.

Yeah.

17:20.204 --> 17:21.957
Are you okay?

17:21.999 --> 17:24.667
Just, just an emotional day.

17:24.710 --> 17:25.919
Oh, yeah, of course,of course.

17:25.961 --> 17:30.090
She manages the drug storethat got broken into.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.551
You really, I've come sucha far way.

17:32.593 --> 17:33.677
It's adorable.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.597
Josie.

17:36.638 --> 17:37.890
Hi, Josie.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.184
Bella.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.435
Babe, are we going?

17:41.477 --> 17:44.146
Ah, my chariot has arrived.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.272
Ta-ta, all.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.857

17:48.984 --> 17:49.860
[clears throat uncomfortably]

17:49.902 --> 17:51.695
What are you doing here?

17:51.737 --> 17:54.656
I came to pick you up.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.950
But I have my car, so...

17:59.870 --> 18:03.123
You know what, Lacy,we should get going.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.792
You guys, drive safely.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.251
Good night.

18:11.799 --> 18:15.636
Um, professor, do you thinkHolmes would say

18:15.677 --> 18:18.263
that's firsthand evidencethat there's trouble

18:18.305 --> 18:20.432
between Elliot and Josie?

18:20.474 --> 18:22.518
Hmm.

18:22.559 --> 18:26.647
Yeah, Lacy. I believe he would.

18:37.157 --> 18:38.659
Morning!

18:38.700 --> 18:40.577
Hey! This is a nice surprise.

18:40.619 --> 18:44.498
Well, I had to do somethingto make up for all those dinnersI missed so...

18:44.540 --> 18:47.668
Ta-da! I brought youGarrison bagels.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.169
Oooh!

29:42.489 --> 29:47.827
I, uh... Just, uh, it seemslike pretty friendly friends.

29:47.869 --> 29:51.498
Well he's just, you know,he's touchy-feely.

29:51.539 --> 29:52.916
He's a theatre guy.

29:52.957 --> 29:53.958
Uh-huh.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.251
Uh-huh.

29:55.293 --> 29:56.085
[laughs]

29:56.127 --> 29:56.836
Hey, listen.

29:56.836 --> 29:58.129
Before you talk to anyone,

29:58.171 --> 29:59.923
uh, there's a few things I wantto talk to you about.

29:59.964 --> 30:01.007
I'm all ears.

30:01.049 --> 30:04.511
Well, I found this wherethe actors take notes.

30:04.511 --> 30:05.386
Mmhmm.

30:05.428 --> 30:06.679
I think it's fromElliot to Bella,

30:06.679 --> 30:08.097
and I think Josieknows about it,

30:08.139 --> 30:10.808
and I think Bella's husbandknows about it.

30:10.850 --> 30:11.726
Huh.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.061
Will... will you hold onto thisfor me?

30:13.102 --> 30:13.770
Absolutely.

30:13.811 --> 30:14.562
Anything else?

30:14.604 --> 30:15.897
Yes, there is something else.

30:15.939 --> 30:19.692
So, earlier tonight, this stagelight came crashing down

30:19.734 --> 30:21.194
just a few feet awayfrom Bella.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.029
I mean, it almost hit her.

30:23.071 --> 30:26.783
So, I looked up, and I....

30:26.825 --> 30:28.826
I thought I saw someoneon the catwalk,

30:28.868 --> 30:32.330
so I went up there,but there was no one.

30:32.372 --> 30:33.665
I mean, I did see Karlup there,

30:33.706 --> 30:35.375
but he was checking itout too, so.

30:35.416 --> 30:36.167
Show me.

30:36.209 --> 30:37.502
Yeah.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.212
Come on.

30:41.047 --> 30:44.259
So it was just right alongdown here.

30:51.140 --> 30:54.894
Hey, um, get me a glove.

31:03.903 --> 31:06.739
Hmm-mmm.

31:06.739 --> 31:08.241
Look at this.

31:08.283 --> 31:12.537
It looks like somebodycut the safety cable.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.080
So, it wasn't an accident.

31:14.122 --> 31:18.626
No, this plan failed,somebody loaded the gun.

31:18.668 --> 31:20.128
Gentlemen.

31:20.169 --> 31:23.715
Bag this safety wire, sweepthe whole area for prints.

31:23.756 --> 31:25.425
Will you go grab Lacyfor me?

31:25.425 --> 31:26.759
Yeah.

31:26.801 --> 31:27.760
Thanks.

31:27.802 --> 31:28.886
I'm sure it's nothing,

31:28.928 --> 31:30.096
but he just wants to ask youa few questions.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.180
Hi, Lacy.

31:31.222 --> 31:32.432
Hi, Detective.

31:32.473 --> 31:36.227
So, I just gotta ask you acouple questions, all right?

31:36.269 --> 31:37.270
It won't take that long.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.938
Do you mind just takinga seat there?

31:41.190 --> 31:43.776
Uh, so I... I guess I'll justleave you guys to it.

31:43.818 --> 31:46.279
Wait, you're not staying?

31:46.279 --> 31:48.656
She can stay, right, Detective?

31:50.408 --> 31:51.117
[stammers] Sh... Yeah, sure.

31:51.117 --> 31:51.784
Yeah.

31:51.784 --> 31:52.952
You want to stay?

31:52.994 --> 31:53.453
Yeah.

31:53.494 --> 31:54.954
All right.

31:54.954 --> 31:56.414
Just, why don't you sit here?

31:56.456 --> 31:57.540
Yeah.

31:57.582 --> 32:01.127
Amy, remember, I... I...I gotta ask the questions.

32:01.169 --> 32:02.503
Yeah.

32:04.964 --> 32:06.299
So.

32:06.341 --> 32:07.425
What do you want to know?

32:07.467 --> 32:09.510
So, the gun was new, right?

32:09.552 --> 32:10.553
That's right.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.138
The old one wasn'tworking consistently,

32:12.180 --> 32:13.848
so Karl offered to bringin the new one.

32:13.890 --> 32:14.974
Who loaded the gun?

32:15.016 --> 32:15.808
Karl.

32:15.808 --> 32:16.809
I gave it to Lacy.

32:16.809 --> 32:18.478
And the gun was with youthe whole time?

32:18.519 --> 32:22.148
No, Bud picked it upat the 15-minute call.

32:22.190 --> 32:22.899
Okay.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.317
So, Lacy handed it to you.

32:24.317 --> 32:27.362
It was sitting on the dressingroom table so I picked it up,

32:27.403 --> 32:29.989
I took it to the booth where itstayed until she grabbed it

32:29.989 --> 32:30.907
for the show.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.325
Do you rememberanybody else, uh,

32:32.367 --> 32:33.868
who might've been inthe dressing room with you?

32:33.910 --> 32:36.496
Bella and her ex-husbandstopped by.

32:36.537 --> 32:37.830
He brought me flowers.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.749
Two dozen long stem.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.668
We chatted for a minute,

32:41.709 --> 32:45.213
then the stage managerkicked me out.

32:45.254 --> 32:46.547
I didn't see any gun.

32:46.589 --> 32:48.841
Is there any reason whyhe would want to hurt you?

32:48.841 --> 32:51.803
Sebastian?

32:51.844 --> 32:52.762
No.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.305
No, we're pals.

32:54.347 --> 32:55.765
How about anybody else?

32:55.807 --> 32:58.768
No, I... I... I can't thinkof anyone

32:58.810 --> 33:00.061
who would want to hurt me.

33:00.103 --> 33:02.021
Can you think of anybodywho would want to hurt Bella?

33:02.021 --> 33:02.689
No.

33:02.730 --> 33:03.648
No way.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.942
Not really, no.

33:05.983 --> 33:07.402
Absolutely not.

33:07.443 --> 33:08.820
Are you kidding?

33:08.861 --> 33:10.279
Everybody loves Bella.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.615
How about this?

33:12.657 --> 33:13.574
Is this yours?

33:13.616 --> 33:14.450
No.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.452
That's cute.

33:16.494 --> 33:17.453
No.

33:17.495 --> 33:18.371
[scoffs]

33:18.371 --> 33:19.205
Is that my wife's?

33:19.247 --> 33:20.707
Why would you ask that?

33:20.707 --> 33:23.376
Oh, she does goofy stuffall the time

33:23.376 --> 33:24.877
to motivate the other actors.

33:24.877 --> 33:27.088
Do I like to motivatemy fellow players?

33:27.130 --> 33:28.214
Yes!

33:28.214 --> 33:30.425
Did I create that?

33:30.466 --> 33:31.634
No.

33:31.676 --> 33:34.011
So, you're telling me thatthere is nothing going on

33:34.053 --> 33:36.139
between Bella and Elliot?

33:36.180 --> 33:36.973
Ask Bella.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.350
Oh, he's sweet.

33:39.392 --> 33:40.351
But that's all.

33:40.393 --> 33:42.103
But Josie thinks otherwise.

33:42.145 --> 33:47.984
Like I told Amy,Josie is just emotional.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.486
What about the light thatalmost hit you?

33:50.528 --> 33:51.863
That was an accident.

33:51.904 --> 33:52.822
No.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.532
Somebody cut the safety cable.

33:54.574 --> 33:57.285
So, you think thatsomeone is....

33:57.326 --> 33:59.746
Is trying to hurt you, yes.

33:59.746 --> 34:04.208
All right, um,well, I will trust

34:04.250 --> 34:06.836
that you're goingto take care of it.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.755
And, um, can we just have

34:08.795 --> 34:11.382

34:11.424 --> 34:14.342
I mean, I'm hosting,it's catered, you know.

34:14.385 --> 34:16.054
Hold on a second,you want to have a party

34:16.094 --> 34:18.473
the same night that somebodytried to murder you?

34:18.514 --> 34:19.974
Well, they failed.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.768
All the more reasonto celebrate.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.270
[laughs weakly]

34:24.270 --> 34:26.022
Detective, you're welcometo come.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.607
Oh, I'll be coming all right.

Thank you all for your time.

34:38.451 --> 34:43.206
I need you all to stay reachableand local.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.918
What do you think?

34:47.960 --> 34:50.630
I think someone in this roomtried to commit a murder,

34:50.670 --> 34:53.341
and they're not going to quituntil they do.

35:05.103 --> 35:08.981
Wow, this is... this issome house.

35:08.981 --> 35:09.774
Yeah.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.359

35:11.400 --> 35:15.321
Apparently, and an apartmentin New York, yeah.

35:15.363 --> 35:18.282
But she says this is herfavourite place to be.

and he's going to be surethat no one's coming in

35:35.174 --> 35:36.676

35:43.724 --> 35:46.811
Detective, do you really thinksomeone would harm me

35:46.853 --> 35:47.979
in my own home?

35:48.020 --> 35:49.897
It sounds a lot easierthan doing it on the stage,

35:49.939 --> 35:51.524
and they tried that already.

35:51.524 --> 35:52.942
Mmhmm.

36:05.329 --> 36:07.290
Trying to prevent a hit.

36:09.125 --> 36:11.127
[metal detector squeals]

36:11.168 --> 36:12.420
[sighs]

36:12.461 --> 36:17.425

01:19:43.653 --> 01:19:47.616
Then, when the timingwas just right,

01:19:47.657 --> 01:19:49.993
your sister tells Amy

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:52.662
that Elliot knew aboutthe security being out,

01:19:52.662 --> 01:19:55.540
so we would blame himfor trying to kill you

01:19:55.582 --> 01:19:57.667
but accidentally killing Bella.

01:19:57.667 --> 01:20:01.171
And you would get your revengeon George Quirk.

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:02.964
Oh, but then there wasSebastian, ugh.

01:20:03.006 --> 01:20:05.175
That guy, right?

01:20:05.175 --> 01:20:07.219
He came in with all his improvisation.

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:08.261
(Travis) It distracted us.

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:10.972
It did. But you stuckto your script.

01:20:11.014 --> 01:20:16.061
That is... Definitelya script.

01:20:16.102 --> 01:20:19.898
Like the crime fictionyou teach, right Professor?

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:25.987
But um, here's the thing.You have no proof.

01:20:26.029 --> 01:20:28.365
Of any of it.

01:20:28.406 --> 01:20:30.283
Yeah, I do.

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:31.034
You do?

01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:34.079
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah,I do.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.747
I forgot.

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:42.671
I found the monkey.Upstairs.

01:20:42.712 --> 01:20:44.881
Yeah, the one that you usedto lure Claire Tate

01:20:44.923 --> 01:20:47.175
to the back of the storeto get the drop on her.

01:20:47.217 --> 01:20:48.426
Yeah.

01:20:48.468 --> 01:20:53.598
Do you know how I know thatthis monkey is that monkey?

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.683
No?

01:20:54.724 --> 01:20:56.726
Well, I mean, if... if I couldopen this bag,

01:20:56.726 --> 01:21:00.897
you would see that in the furof the monkey,

01:21:00.897 --> 01:21:02.399
it's... it's almost microscopic.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:07.362
It's got these tinylittle bitty red flecks.

01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:11.032
And I would be willing to betall the amount of money

01:21:11.074 --> 01:21:13.743
that you guys thinkyou're going to inherit,

01:21:13.743 --> 01:21:17.163
that when Detective Burke hereruns a DNA test

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:19.332
on those red flecks,

01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:21.751
they're going to matchClaire Tate's blood.

01:21:21.751 --> 01:21:25.714
[suspenseful music]♪

01:21:25.755 --> 01:21:27.215
Duncan.

01:21:29.676 --> 01:21:32.053
[sighs]

01:21:33.263 --> 01:21:35.974
You know you're right about thiscoming from the play.

01:21:36.016 --> 01:21:37.976
It was my idea.

01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:39.185
A one-man show.

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:40.895
Josie didn't know anythingabout this.

01:21:40.937 --> 01:21:42.272
Duncan, no.

01:21:42.272 --> 01:21:44.649
You talked to her.

01:21:44.691 --> 01:21:46.818
I hate her.

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:48.028
Look at her.

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:52.490
Little goody two shoes,trying to straighten me out.

01:21:52.532 --> 01:21:56.995
Why would I risk my lifeto plan a crime with her?

01:21:57.037 --> 01:21:59.289
Stop it, it's not true.

01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:00.707
It was my idea,not his.

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:01.708
Josie.

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:04.544
No.

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:05.754
[sighs]

01:22:05.795 --> 01:22:09.007
You're all I have.

01:22:09.049 --> 01:22:13.136
And I'm not letting you takethis all on.

01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:14.971
We did it together.

01:22:15.013 --> 01:22:18.016
We did it for our parentsand for each other.

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.402
So...

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:31.571
Yeah.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:34.616
It was lucky that you foundthat monkey.

01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:36.826
Mmm.

01:22:36.826 --> 01:22:40.413
It was lucky that Claire's bloodwas on it.

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:42.248
Oh, there was no blood on it.

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:43.333
Wait.

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:45.377
You...

01:22:45.418 --> 01:22:46.252
Did you?...

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:47.253
Yeah.

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:49.381
I... I bluffed himinto confessing, yes.

01:22:49.422 --> 01:22:52.342
Amy, what if it didn't work?

01:22:52.342 --> 01:22:54.219
Well, it did.

01:22:59.432 --> 01:23:00.684
"The people who lie the most

01:23:00.725 --> 01:23:02.811
"are nearly always the clumsiest at it,

01:23:02.852 --> 01:23:04.229
"and they're easier to foolwith lies

01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:06.064
"than most people, too.

01:23:06.106 --> 01:23:08.692
"You'd think they'd beon the look-out for lies,

01:23:08.692 --> 01:23:11.361
"but they seem to be the veryones that will believe

01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:13.363
"almost anything at all."

01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:17.701
That was written in 1934,believe it or not.

01:23:17.742 --> 01:23:20.203
Still stands true today.

01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:22.038
Okay, all right guys.Thank you.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.040
Have a good weekend.

01:23:27.043 --> 01:23:29.629
Hey, Lacy. I wanted to talkto you about something.

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:33.550
Um, I have been talking toVincent about doing

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:36.136

01:23:39.889 --> 01:23:40.640
[laughs]

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:42.225
Uh, yes, that's wonderful.

01:23:42.225 --> 01:23:42.892

Yeah.

Okay.

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:45.478

01:23:55.113 --> 01:23:56.573
Thanks for helping Travis.

01:23:56.573 --> 01:23:57.490
Oh.

01:23:57.532 --> 01:23:58.533
Hey, we're going to goget some food.

01:23:58.575 --> 01:23:59.743
Do you want to comewith us?

01:23:59.784 --> 01:24:04.456
Uh... Actually, I gota better idea.

01:24:08.585 --> 01:24:09.794
Okay, guys.

01:24:09.836 --> 01:24:14.966
I haven't made Korean tacosin a while, so be gentle.

01:24:15.008 --> 01:24:16.342
These look delicious.

01:24:16.384 --> 01:24:18.762
I didn't even know there wassuch a thing as Korean tacos.

01:24:18.803 --> 01:24:21.973
Oh, yes, yes, I... I first hadthem in Seoul

01:24:22.015 --> 01:24:23.308
when I was doing researchfor the...

01:24:23.349 --> 01:24:24.601
Seven Stars.

01:24:24.642 --> 01:24:26.102
Yeah, Seven Stars there.

01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:27.187
Very good.

01:24:27.228 --> 01:24:29.355
See, see what a devoted studenthe is, Amy?

01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:30.648
Well, come on, I mean,

01:24:30.690 --> 01:24:33.443
you only had one Atticus Kellerbook set in Korea.

01:24:33.443 --> 01:24:36.029
Actually, I don't mean to bea Graham Winslow geek,

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:40.784
but the first chapter of AmberMoon starts with Atticus

01:24:40.825 --> 01:24:43.369
still in Korea whenhe gets the phone call.

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:46.456
From, um, the widow,uh, what was her name?

01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:47.123
Annette...

01:24:47.165 --> 01:24:48.249
(All) Beja.

01:24:48.291 --> 01:24:49.000
[laughs]

01:24:49.042 --> 01:24:50.543
You are a Graham Winslow geek!

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:51.795
Come on, dig in.

01:24:51.836 --> 01:24:53.338
[laughing]

01:24:53.379 --> 01:24:54.631
Are you working out?

01:24:54.672 --> 01:24:56.466
Maybe I should if we're goingto have any more chases

01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:57.383
through the woods?

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:58.468
Yeah.

01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:01.346
What are you guys talking about?

01:25:01.387 --> 01:25:02.263
(Both) Nothing.

01:25:02.305 --> 01:25:03.264
[clears throat]

01:25:03.306 --> 01:25:04.307
Oh.

01:25:04.307 --> 01:25:05.642
Hmm.

01:25:05.642 --> 01:25:08.978
Well, I'm just glad thatwe're finally all able

01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:10.480
to break bread together.

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.190
This does not looklike bread, sir.

01:25:12.232 --> 01:25:14.609
No, but it's delicious.You're going to love it.

01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:18.488
Almost as much as you lovemy dad's books.

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:19.656
Dig in.

01:25:19.697 --> 01:25:20.782
[laughing]

01:25:20.824 --> 01:25:22.325
Mmm!
