LAINEY: Nothing burns
quite as hot
as your first love.

00:04.172 --> 00:06.174
For me, that was
Barry Goldberg.

00:06.207 --> 00:09.610
I thought we were gonna
last forever,
but life had other plans.

00:09.643 --> 00:12.646
When I left Jenkintown,
I thought our story was over,

00:12.680 --> 00:13.914
but I was wrong.

00:13.947 --> 00:15.216
After almost a decade,
I was shocked

00:15.249 --> 00:17.751
when Barry dropped back
into my life.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.653
One, two, three, four...

00:19.687 --> 00:22.990
* I would walk
five hundred miles

00:23.023 --> 00:26.594
* And I would walk
five hundred more

00:26.627 --> 00:31.165
* Just to be the one
who walks a thousand miles

00:31.199 --> 00:33.801
* To fall down at your door

00:33.834 --> 00:35.569
* Ba-da, da, da, da,
ba-da, da, da, da

00:35.603 --> 00:36.937
* Ba-da, da, da, da,
ba-da, da, da, da *

00:36.970 --> 00:39.173
Barry!
What are you doing here?

00:39.207 --> 00:41.842
Just surprising
my favorite girl in the world.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.345
Yes, I'm familiar.
You've been
surprising me all week.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.647
Please,
just give me one minute.
Fine.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.383
Okay,
just hear me out.
No, you hear me out.

00:49.417 --> 00:52.220
All this stuff may have worked
in high school, okay,
but everything's changed.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.454
We're, like, adults now.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.788
That's my point.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.690
Everything I've done
since high school

00:56.724 --> 00:58.892
has been in preparation
for this very moment.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.394
What are you
talking about?

01:00.428 --> 01:01.862
I graduated New York Med,

01:01.895 --> 01:04.232
I finished my internship,
my residency,

01:04.265 --> 01:06.467
and now I'm gonna be
a radiologist, dude!

01:06.500 --> 01:08.369
I gotta admit,
it's all very surprising.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.238
Exactly.
I am an adult.

01:10.271 --> 01:14.041
And I promised myself,
the moment I got to this place
I'd come back.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.143
For you.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.744
That is so sweet.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.912
So that's a yes?
You'll move to Detroit
with me?

01:18.946 --> 01:20.080
Wait, what?
Detroit.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.515
It's a pretty big city
in Michigan.

01:21.549 --> 01:22.850
It's where Axel Foley
lives.

01:22.883 --> 01:25.153
I know what Detroit is.
Why would I ever move there?

01:25.186 --> 01:27.555
It's where
my fellowship is.
It's just a few years.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.123
Bar, this is
a lot to take in.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.591
Lemme think about it,
okay?

01:30.624 --> 01:34.027
As a doctor I'm used to doing
things "stat," but okay.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.665
CB: (SIGHS) Yeesh.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.433
Detroit, huh?
You heard all that?

01:39.467 --> 01:40.734
Well, it's
kinda hard not to.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.102
He screams
everything he says.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.271
I can't
just move to Michigan.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.538
I've built
a whole life here.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.006
Great! So it sounds
like it's settled!

01:46.039 --> 01:47.775
But he's also so charming
and passionate,

01:47.808 --> 01:49.877
and, my God,
a radiologist?

01:49.910 --> 01:50.944
I don't even know
what that is.

01:50.978 --> 01:53.514
Well, I guess I'd say,
you know,

01:53.547 --> 01:54.582
don't rush into a decision,

01:54.615 --> 01:55.883
'cause you never know
when someone else

01:55.916 --> 01:57.418
is gonna come along
and capture your heart.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.786
Ha, ha!
Gotta go!

02:06.260 --> 02:07.295
Oh!

02:07.328 --> 02:08.762
I've been
watching you, bro,

02:08.796 --> 02:09.997
and I know
what's going on.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.465
What are you
talking about?

02:11.499 --> 02:14.168
I'm talking about
you and Lainey.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.970
And how you two
are clearly just friends!
Oh!

02:17.004 --> 02:19.340
I can tell
this is that rare case

02:19.373 --> 02:21.975
where you're
a guy who isn't a threat
to my relationship at all.

02:22.009 --> 02:24.412
Yeah, that's me.
No threat.

02:24.445 --> 02:25.646
What are you doing
in my car?

02:25.679 --> 02:27.448
Dude,
I gotta get Lainey back.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.116
You're
her best friend here.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.485
In the name of love,
will you help me?

02:31.519 --> 02:33.086
If I say yes,
will you get out of my car?

02:33.120 --> 02:34.755
I knew I could count on you,
Bee Bop.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.324
It's CB.
Okay.

* Someday, you will say
"Those were the days" *

LAINEY: It was May 8th,
1990-something,

02:59.980 --> 03:01.849
and graduation
was right around the corner.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.984
Which meant another big event
was coming up...

03:04.017 --> 03:05.953
Prank week!
It is upon us!

03:05.986 --> 03:07.020
And God only knows

03:07.054 --> 03:09.290
the chaos
those students are planning.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.924
So we've all got to be
on high alert

03:10.958 --> 03:12.826
to make sure those punks
don't make fools of us again.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.695
Am I right?
Wrong!

03:14.728 --> 03:17.698
Look, I know that Earl Ball
used to crack down
on prank week,

03:17.731 --> 03:20.601
but as your new, progressive
leader I think we should...

03:20.634 --> 03:23.103
Immediately impose
oppressive security measures!

03:23.136 --> 03:24.705
Did you really think
that's where I was going?

03:24.738 --> 03:25.806
No.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.475
Which is why I had
to wedge my idea in there.

03:27.508 --> 03:30.177
Look, if we create
an environment of playful fun

03:30.210 --> 03:33.481
and send the message that
we're cool with safe pranks,

03:33.514 --> 03:34.982
everyone comes out
a winner.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.216
"Safe pranks"?

03:36.250 --> 03:37.318
This is madness!

03:37.351 --> 03:39.453
No! It's to empower
the students!

03:39.487 --> 03:41.622
Okay, come on.
There's got to be someone here

03:41.655 --> 03:43.190
who gets
what I'm trying to do.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.025
I'm sorry.
Uh, who are you?

03:45.058 --> 03:46.193
Rod Borton.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.396
I'm a representative of
the school's Board of Regents.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.230
I'm just observing
for the day.

03:50.264 --> 03:53.534
Little
faculty evaluation, huh?
Which teacher?

03:53.567 --> 03:54.635
Just observing.

03:54.668 --> 03:55.969
So you can't tell us?

03:56.003 --> 03:58.406
I would just continue on
as if I wasn't here.

03:58.439 --> 04:01.008

04:05.613 --> 04:07.381
That observer
is here for you!

Uh, yeah,
that was pretty obvious.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.485
But it's fine.
My record is spotless.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.820
Oh, yeah, sure,
you've had some wins,

04:12.853 --> 04:15.055
but you've also
done some things
that people might find...

04:15.088 --> 04:16.424
Questionable.
Like what?

04:16.457 --> 04:17.825
Well, you rigged
a school election.

04:17.858 --> 04:18.926
Unsuccessfully.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.093
You started a Fight Club.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.261
Which had
great attendance!

04:21.295 --> 04:23.096
You also blew up
half the science lab.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.898
Hello? It's called
an "experiment"...

04:24.932 --> 04:27.200
The whole point is
you don't know
what will happen.

04:27.234 --> 04:30.738
Stop spinning your
clear failures
as giant success!

04:30.771 --> 04:32.340

that's just who I am.

Hey,
that's a cool nickname.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.546
Can you get that
started for me?

04:38.579 --> 04:41.248
Maybe. In the meantime,
keep an eye out for the spy.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.416
Appreciate the concern,
buddy.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.084
But I got
nothing to worry about.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.392
Hey, do you want to grab lunch
in the caf?

04:51.425 --> 04:54.027
I'm sorry. I promised Barry
that I'd pop over to Chi-Chi's

04:54.061 --> 04:55.463
for a quick
chimichanga break.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.930
What? Why?

04:56.964 --> 05:00.133
He approached me
in an unconventional manner,
but we hit it off.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.234
Unreal!

05:01.268 --> 05:02.470
The guy just shows up
out of the blue

05:02.503 --> 05:04.438
and thinks he can
insert himself
back into my life!

05:04.472 --> 05:05.906
Dude has no boundaries!

05:05.939 --> 05:08.041
That's pretty clear.
But in a sweet way.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.243
The big sweaty monster
just loves me so much.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.945
Ugh!
It's so confusing!

05:13.981 --> 05:15.483
Very odd.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.817
What is?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.419
That you
befriended the ex

05:18.452 --> 05:20.721
of the very woman
that you likey.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.290
Okay, I don't know
where you heard that from,

05:23.323 --> 05:25.426
but that is 100%
categorically false.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.127

blabbed big time.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.228
Damn her!

05:28.261 --> 05:29.897
Well, maybe I likey,

05:29.930 --> 05:31.999
but once my plan
goes into effect,

05:32.032 --> 05:34.402
Lainey Lewis
will likey me backy.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.604
I'm shockingly interested.
Go on.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.572
Barry wants me to help
win Lainey back,

05:38.606 --> 05:39.973
but instead of
helping Barry,

05:40.007 --> 05:42.910
I'm gonna do
some Grade A saba-tayge!

05:42.943 --> 05:43.977
You mean sabotage?

05:44.011 --> 05:45.679
Oh, yes. Saba-tayge.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.248
I'm tired of being
the good boy
who doesn't get the girl.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.951
So, instead,
I'm gonna be the bad boy
who does get the girl.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.953
Didn't think
you had it in you, kid!

05:52.986 --> 05:54.187
Saba-tayge!

05:54.221 --> 05:56.123
Stop it.
That's not how
it's pronounced.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.357
It's sabotage.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.092
That's what we're saying.

in the name of love,

06:04.532 --> 06:08.135
CB was gonna push Barry
into an over-the-top
romantic gesture

06:08.168 --> 06:10.037

It's not big enough.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.686
Wait!
I know exactly what to do.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.054
Is it big?
Tell me it's big.

06:27.087 --> 06:30.290
It is so big,
it is small.
Wha?

06:30.323 --> 06:32.025
Lainey says
I haven't grown up.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.127
Maybe I just
take her to coffee

06:34.161 --> 06:37.465
so I can
discuss my feelings with her
like a mature adult.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.132
You sound like an idiot
right now.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.168
You want grown-up?
I got the perfect idea.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.636
The a cappella concert
is on Friday.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.304
It's incredibly important
to Lainey,

06:44.337 --> 06:46.707
so what better time
to take the spotlight

06:46.740 --> 06:49.309
and serenade her
in front of everyone?

06:49.342 --> 06:52.145
That is perfect.
I'll need backup.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.538
Buh-bye! Bye!

07:50.571 --> 07:51.939
Thank you for coming.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.406
Thank you all.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.609
What the hell?

07:55.643 --> 07:56.977
Listen,
I need you to tell me

07:57.010 --> 07:58.612
what the senior prank
is gonna be.
No.

07:58.646 --> 07:59.947
Please?
I'm not gonna ruin it.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.715
I just need to know
that it's harmless fun.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.316
No.
(GROANS)

08:04.017 --> 08:05.152
Oh, no. It's him.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.955
Don't look!
He's a spy from
the Board of Regents.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.823
Quick, pretend
I said something funny.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.158
(BOTH CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)

08:11.191 --> 08:13.060
I don't get it. Is he spying
to see if you're funny?

08:13.093 --> 08:14.762
Just go with it.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.997
(BOTH LAUGHING)

08:19.199 --> 08:21.669
He's buying it.
Now tell me what the prank is.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.904
We stole
Central High's mascot,
Jerry the Goat,

08:23.937 --> 08:25.573
and we're gonna put him
in your office.

08:25.606 --> 08:28.976
Oh, ho, ho, now, that's
some classic harmless fun.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.343
(JERRY BLEATS)

08:30.377 --> 08:32.613
Oh, God, this was
supposed to be harmless fun!

08:32.646 --> 08:33.981
He bit Johnny Atkins
in the face.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.515
That's not cool at all!

08:35.549 --> 08:36.850
Maybe we should call
animal control?

08:36.884 --> 08:39.152
Not while
I'm under the microscope.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.754
I'll handle this myself.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.756
**

08:42.790 --> 08:44.191
Here, goaty, goaty.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.093
Here, goaty, goaty.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.494
Yeah, that's right.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.262
**

08:49.296 --> 08:51.231
(DOOR CLOSES)
(JERRY BLEATS)

08:51.264 --> 08:52.332
Okay, everyone.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.934
Your Head of School
has done his job

08:53.967 --> 08:58.005
and trapped the angry goat
in our new state-of-the-art
computer lab.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.707
(CRASH, JERRY BLEATS)

09:00.207 --> 09:01.474
(JERRY BLEATS)

09:01.508 --> 09:03.677
I hope this doesn't look bad!

09:03.711 --> 09:05.045
(CRASHING CONTINUES)

09:05.078 --> 09:07.380
LAINEY: Glascott's shot
at a good job review
was shrinking,

09:07.414 --> 09:10.217
while I was ready
for my kids' biggest
performance of the year.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.853
And so I proudly present
The Quaker's Dozen.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.987
(APPLAUSE)

09:14.021 --> 09:16.389
Attention,
parents and choir.

09:16.423 --> 09:17.858
Barry,
what the hell, dude?

09:17.891 --> 09:20.560
Lainey Lewis,
you are the love of my life,

09:20.594 --> 09:22.930
and I'd do anything
to be with you again.

09:22.963 --> 09:26.634
* Dum, dum, dum, da, da, dum
Even walk 500 miles.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.468
* Dum, dum, dum, da, da, dum
Barry, no.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.803
* Dum, dum, dum,
da, da, dum

09:29.837 --> 09:32.405
* Dum, dum, dum, da, da, dum
* When I wake up

09:32.439 --> 09:36.009
LAINEY: And just like that,
CB's plan of saba-tayge
was put into action.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.911
And it worked better than
he could ever imagine.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.813
* Ba-da, da, da, da,
ba-da, da, da, da

09:39.847 --> 09:41.649
* Ba-da, da, da, da,
ba-da, da, da, da

09:41.682 --> 09:44.217
* Ba-da dum, diddle dum,
diddle dum, diddle da, da, da

09:44.251 --> 09:45.919
* Ba-da, da, da, da,
ba-da, da, da, da
* When I...

09:45.953 --> 09:47.220
* Ba-da, da, da, da,
ba-da, da, da, da

09:47.254 --> 09:48.756
No, I'm supposed to sing now!

09:48.789 --> 09:51.124
* Ba-da dum, diddle dum,
diddle dum, diddle da, da, da
Don't do it again!

09:51.158 --> 09:53.193
* Ba-da, da, da, da,
ba-da, da, da, da
It's really hard to stop.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.261
Guys, please.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.763
* Ba-da, da, da, da

09:55.796 --> 09:57.530
* Ba-da dum, diddle dum,
diddle dum, diddle da, da, da

09:57.564 --> 09:58.899
We're stuck
in the song!

09:58.932 --> 10:00.300
* Ba-da, da, da, da *
Dear God, shut up!

10:01.434 --> 10:02.870
What are you doing?

10:02.903 --> 10:05.572
All these parents came to
hear the kids, not you idiots!

10:05.605 --> 10:09.176
But I know for a fact
you'd be moving with me
to Detroit right now

10:09.209 --> 10:11.411
if we hadn't gotten
stuck in that insane loop!

10:11.444 --> 10:14.114
Barry, I have a life here.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.516
This is
what's important to me.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.018
It just proves
that you don't care

10:18.051 --> 10:19.687
and you haven't
grown up at all.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.722
**

10:23.957 --> 10:25.258
LAINEY: Principal's Glascott's

10:25.292 --> 10:27.527
idea of a harmless prank week
had gotten out of hand,

10:27.560 --> 10:29.697
and the Board of Regents
were not pleased.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.632
Thousands of dollars'
worth of computers destroyed.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.034
It's not my fault.

10:34.067 --> 10:37.771
The goat was only
supposed to be in my office,
but he's a curious sort.

10:37.805 --> 10:40.273
Wait, wait, wait.
You knew about this prank
ahead of time?

10:40.307 --> 10:42.209
Uhh...
Do you know
what'll happen

10:42.242 --> 10:44.778
when the board finds out
you knew?
What are you saying?

10:44.812 --> 10:47.147
I have to reinstate myself
as Head of School!

10:47.180 --> 10:50.083
What?
(WHISPERING) I'm sorry.
He's watching me, too.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.152
(NORMAL VOICE) The board
is going to do a full review

10:52.185 --> 10:54.287
to determine your future
as Head of School.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.256
I don't even get to see
those kids graduate?

10:56.289 --> 10:57.791
No, John. No.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.927
The board has spoken,
and I support them fully.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.461
(WHISPERING)
Did he just write that down?

11:01.494 --> 11:03.463
Because I'm saying really
great stuff about the board.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.465
(WHISPERING) He did not.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.434
**

11:07.467 --> 11:10.103
Attention,
students and faculty.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.973
I have a brief announcement
to make.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.341
Effective immediately,

11:14.374 --> 11:16.810
I will be taking
a leave of absence,

11:16.844 --> 11:20.247
and Earl Ball
will be your new
Head of School.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.315
Oh, no.
Poor John.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.483
Long overdue.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.285
My friend needs me!

11:26.053 --> 11:28.121
This is what's best
for the school,

11:28.155 --> 11:30.157
and, honestly,
it's what's best for me.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.792
Hang in there, Johnny!

11:31.825 --> 11:35.362
I'm sure I will be welcoming
many of you back in the fall,

11:35.395 --> 11:36.997
except for you seniors,

11:37.030 --> 11:39.666
who I will not
see graduate.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.034
It's okay, pal.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.370
It's okay. Rick is here,
and he's gonna fix this.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.172
We both know
it's over for me.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.707
Well, in that case,
I got something
I want to say to you.

11:47.741 --> 11:51.011
Nobody, and I mean nobody,
is gonna miss you
more than me.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.047
Because
you're my best friend!

11:54.081 --> 11:56.817
GLASCOTT: You're
my best friend, too.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.518
COACH MELLOR: Ah, would you
mind if I gave you

11:58.551 --> 12:01.688
the strongest, most loving hug
on the planet right now?

12:01.721 --> 12:03.556
GLASCOTT: It would be
an honor, sir.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.025
COACH MELLOR: Put your heart
against mine.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.093
Twits.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.896
(SIGHS)

12:08.929 --> 12:11.664
John.
(GLASCOTT SOBBING)

12:11.698 --> 12:13.901
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Oh, yes, Rick?

12:13.934 --> 12:15.535
COACH MELLOR: Why is
that red light on?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.537
GLASCOTT: Oh... (BLEEP)

12:18.705 --> 12:20.673
(WHISTLING)

12:20.707 --> 12:22.075
CB.
Aah!

12:22.109 --> 12:24.211
What the...
Why are you people in my car?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.545
We thought someone
should sit up front,

12:25.578 --> 12:27.680
but Barry said
it would "ruin the elegance."

12:27.714 --> 12:28.916
And it would have.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.651
Barry lost
his greatest love today.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.386
I'm sorry.
Why are you all here?

12:33.420 --> 12:36.056
I just wanted
to say thank you.
For helping me out.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.991
You didn't have to,
but you did.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.860
Just like we look out
for each other in the JTP.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.028
TOGETHER: JTP.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.663
That's why I wanted
to announce
that, forevermore,

12:43.696 --> 12:47.234
you, CB, are also a member
of the Jenkintown Posse.

12:47.267 --> 12:51.604
I'm still not exactly clear
on what the posse is,
but thank you?

12:51.638 --> 12:53.907
Look, none of this
went the way I wanted,

12:53.941 --> 12:55.408
but at the very least...

12:55.442 --> 12:56.609
I made a good friend.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.812
Oh, I don't know
if I'm that good.

12:58.846 --> 13:01.815
Lainey told me you're like
the best person she knows,
and she was right.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.051
I'm sorry.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.486
Me too. Really thought
your plan would work.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.620
JTP.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.056
OTHERS: JTP.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.723
You're supposed to
say it with us.

13:10.757 --> 13:11.791
JTP?

13:11.825 --> 13:13.226
That was bad.
Yeah, man.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.661
You just sound
uncomfortable.

13:14.694 --> 13:17.264
See, you really need to read
the energy of everybody
and try to match it.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.398
I'll work on that.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.267
Yeah, you got it.
Yeah.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.369
**

13:22.402 --> 13:23.703
Uncle J,
this is bull crap!

13:23.736 --> 13:26.606
They can't just let you go
because a goat
bit our janitor.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.241
They didn't do this,
Felicia.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.409
I did.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.615
This isn't fair!

13:35.648 --> 13:37.384
C'mon, Coach.
You gotta do something.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.252
This is one thing
teachers can't fix.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.090
**

13:44.157 --> 13:45.158
You're right.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.094
We'll fix it ourselves.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.062
**

13:49.096 --> 13:53.000
ALL: (CHANTING) John Glascott
graduates us!

13:53.901 --> 13:55.936
This is madness.

13:55.969 --> 13:59.106
I need all of you to get
out there and shut this down.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.507
No can do, Ball.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.911
The young have tasted
the power of protest,
and they are savoring it.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.013
Where'd they even get
this stupid idea from?

14:06.046 --> 14:07.347
From a girl
named Donna Martin,

14:07.380 --> 14:08.848
who attends
a school so elite

14:08.882 --> 14:10.783
they have
their own valet parking.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.185
West Beverly High.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.320
Huh?

14:13.353 --> 14:15.822
(CHANTING)
Donna Martin graduates!

14:15.855 --> 14:18.291
Wait, these actors are
supposed to be teenagers?

14:18.325 --> 14:20.127
'Cause that guy's
clearly 35.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.528
Don't ruin this
for us, Liz.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.463
As you can see,
the entire student body

14:23.496 --> 14:24.998
banded together
to help someone

14:25.032 --> 14:27.200
who was deeply wronged
by the administration.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.936
Oh, my.
What happened?

14:28.969 --> 14:30.537
Their rich friend
was suspended

14:30.570 --> 14:32.639
because she showed up
drunk at the prom.

14:32.672 --> 14:33.806
Ah.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.809
Look, I love John
just as much as you guys,

14:36.843 --> 14:38.645
but my hands are tied.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.547
I'm sorry.
He's not coming back.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.382
Well, it's a damn shame
to hear that, Earl.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.484
Because
neither are we.
Excuse me?

14:44.517 --> 14:45.818
You heard those kids.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.455
John Glascott
graduates us.
What?

14:48.488 --> 14:51.124
John Glascott
graduates us.
You?

14:51.158 --> 14:52.892
John Glascott graduates us.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.127
I'm so confused.

14:54.161 --> 14:56.563
John Glascott graduates us.

14:56.596 --> 14:57.965
Okay, stop.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.867
And even though
this dramatic display
makes no sense whatsoever,

15:00.900 --> 15:03.370
clearly,
the man made an impact,

15:03.403 --> 15:06.139
not only on you,
but on those kids.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.640
Ah, screw it.

15:07.674 --> 15:10.577
And I don't even care
what the creepy lurking
nerd thinks.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.646
I'm going to tell the board
Glascott stays or we all go.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.714
Hey.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.216
You know I can hear you!

15:16.249 --> 15:17.884
You heard the nerd part?

15:17.917 --> 15:18.986
I heard it all.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.021
But I agree about Glascott.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.089
Guy grows on you.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.757
He really does.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.559
LAINEY: CB's sabotage
had worked.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.061
I'd rejected Barry.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.763
But, turns out, neither of us
felt good about it.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.332
Hey.
Hi.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.666
Do you have a sec
to talk?

15:33.700 --> 15:35.568
Sure.
But what's the point?

15:35.602 --> 15:38.038
You talk, I listen,
love dies, the end.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.506
Look,
you wouldn't be this upset

15:39.539 --> 15:40.773
if you didn't want
to be with this guy.

15:40.807 --> 15:44.511
So I think you really
need to ask yourself

15:44.544 --> 15:45.712
what it is that...
I want Barry.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.380
Okay,
you answered super fast,

15:47.414 --> 15:48.748
so maybe you should
think it over and...

15:48.781 --> 15:49.849
I love him.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.851
But maybe there's
a sliver...
He's the one!

15:51.884 --> 15:53.186
But...
It's him.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.521
Okay, now you're
not even answering me.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.788
You're just
talking over me.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.757
Look, I've always known
I was supposed to be
with Barry.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.227
But be with him
in Michigan?

16:00.260 --> 16:01.461
I can't just leave.

16:01.494 --> 16:04.897
Working here, getting to know
you and the other teachers,

16:04.931 --> 16:06.499
you're like
my family now.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.936
Look...

16:09.969 --> 16:11.704
You know, some people
spend their whole lives

16:11.738 --> 16:13.706
trying to find "the one."

16:13.740 --> 16:16.943
And if Barry
is that person to you,

16:16.976 --> 16:18.445
I'll help you fix it.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.579
You would do that
for me?

16:19.612 --> 16:21.181
I'd do anything for you.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.050
But I rejected him.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.417
Hard. In public.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.419
Trust me, Barry is not
gonna want to hear from me.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.388
Well, I'm a member
of the TJP now,

16:28.421 --> 16:30.290
so he'll listen to me.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.659
**

16:32.692 --> 16:35.895
LAINEY: CB promised
that he'd get Barry to give me
a second chance,

16:35.928 --> 16:37.930
and he knew
exactly how to convince him.

16:37.964 --> 16:41.234
The school wants to name me
"Athlete of the Century"?

16:41.268 --> 16:42.335
Yup.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.603
Look at everyone
who signed this!

16:43.636 --> 16:46.606
Glascott, Coach Mellor,
Earl Ball!

16:46.639 --> 16:48.841
Rookie sensation
Allen Iverson?

16:48.875 --> 16:51.844
Flyers power forward
Eric Lindros?

16:51.878 --> 16:53.446
All names
I assumed you'd know.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.082
Life is weird.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.917
On the one hand, I'm about
to receive this great honor,

16:57.950 --> 16:59.152
and on the other,

16:59.186 --> 17:01.454
Lainey broke my heart
into a million pieces,

17:01.488 --> 17:04.324
and now I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life
sad, angry, and alone.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.060
We should head out.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.261
Okay.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.797
Man, this has been
a very mixed century for me.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.334
I cannot wait
to meet Allen Iverson!

17:14.367 --> 17:16.869
But first, there's something
I think you should see.

17:21.974 --> 17:23.009
Lainey?

17:23.042 --> 17:24.244
What's all this?

17:24.277 --> 17:25.378
It's a yes.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.681
One, two, three, four.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.583

18:13.092 --> 18:15.061
It's a good song when
you don't get stuck in a loop.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.597
Well, that's
where I've been.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.332
In a loop with you.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.067
It's always been you,
and here we are again.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.003
What changed your mind?

18:24.036 --> 18:26.639
CB reminded me
if you're lucky enough
to find "the one,"

18:26.673 --> 18:27.707
you better not let go.

18:29.576 --> 18:30.577
JTP.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.712
JTP.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.981
(VOCALIZING STOPS)
Look, I love you.

18:35.014 --> 18:37.917
And that means
I can't ask you to leave.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.052
You're an amazing teacher,
and you belong here.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.454
What does that mean
for us?

18:41.488 --> 18:42.922
We're not kids anymore.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.056
We'll figure it out.

Yeah, we will.

Looks good on ya, boss.

18:58.838 --> 18:59.972
I gotta admit,

19:00.006 --> 19:01.941
I was shocked when
the board asked me
to come back.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.044
Well, when they saw all those
kids taking a stand for you,

19:05.077 --> 19:06.746
it was hard to deny
you belong here.

19:06.779 --> 19:07.814
You really think so?

19:07.847 --> 19:09.048
Is that microphone off?

19:09.081 --> 19:10.750
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.452
I do.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.387
You're a great boss,

19:14.421 --> 19:15.788
and an even better
friend.

Damn it, you're gonna
make me cry again.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.159
Um, hi.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.261
Hi.
Hi.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.629
You should get yourself
together, Uncle J.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.331
You don't want
the whole school
to see you like that.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.147
LAINEY: My first year back
at William Penn

19:41.180 --> 19:44.517
brought a ton of
new challenges and surprises.

19:44.551 --> 19:47.587
I learned that new experiences
can be tough for anybody,

19:47.620 --> 19:48.855
including teachers.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.123
Man, I love this job.

19:51.157 --> 19:52.359
It's hard not to.

19:52.392 --> 19:55.562
No matter how hard you try,
you're bound to have failures,

19:55.595 --> 19:57.964
but when you are passionate
about what you're doing

19:57.997 --> 20:00.367
and have the support
of the people around you,

20:00.400 --> 20:02.034
you just might prove
to yourself

20:02.068 --> 20:04.304
that you're right
where you're meant to be.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.939
What do you remember
about the first time

20:06.973 --> 20:08.207
you stepped into
William Penn?

20:08.241 --> 20:10.176
I remember driving up
to the school,

20:10.209 --> 20:12.979
opening
the big red door,

20:13.012 --> 20:14.947
and I said,
"This is where I need to be."

20:14.981 --> 20:16.716
I just... I love students.
I love kids.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.351
How do you
make math fun?

20:18.385 --> 20:19.986
It's just getting
their confidence together.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.322
And once they feel
like they can do it,
then they usually like it.

20:22.355 --> 20:25.292
But it's mostly just trying
to connect with the student

20:25.325 --> 20:27.360
and making them feel
that I care about
their success.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.028
How do you get the kids
excited about art?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.864
MR. GRANGER:
Let them know that
failure is valued here,

20:31.898 --> 20:33.500
because
this is where we learn,

20:33.533 --> 20:36.736
and this is a safe place
where we're not gonna
let you fail and fall

20:36.769 --> 20:38.571
without being able
to pick yourself up

20:38.605 --> 20:40.172
and move
to a higher level.

20:40.206 --> 20:42.975
What part did you love
the most about teaching?

20:43.009 --> 20:46.713
The relationships
that you get to form
with the kids over time.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.915
Outside of class, you know,
they come to you

20:48.948 --> 20:51.351
and talk about their problems,
issues.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.485
T-That's the best.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.186
How would you deal
with difficult parents?

20:54.220 --> 20:55.722
Recognize where
they're coming from.

20:55.755 --> 20:59.158
And when you're a parent,
if your kid's struggling,
it's really painful,

20:59.191 --> 21:00.760
but when you're a teacher
and a kid's struggling,

21:00.793 --> 21:02.529
you just feel like
you could help out
a little bit.

21:02.562 --> 21:03.830
It's about the kid.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.732
What does it feel like
when you've coached
a kid in high school,

21:05.765 --> 21:07.099
and you see him or her

21:07.133 --> 21:08.868
go on to be
a professional athlete?

21:08.901 --> 21:10.503
I think first of all,
you feel good for the kid.

21:10.537 --> 21:13.272
You see the work that
they've put into it,
watching them improve.

21:13.306 --> 21:16.543
It's their dream, and
it's nice to see a dream
come true for these kids.

21:16.576 --> 21:19.346
When you have a school
that's basically
a small school,

21:19.379 --> 21:21.247
the relationships
with the teachers

21:21.280 --> 21:24.016
end up being tremendously
important for students.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.585
I feel inspired.
