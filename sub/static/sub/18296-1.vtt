singing Gilbert and Sullivan.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.750
What's more American than that?

01:16.911 --> 01:20.251
First of all, Gilbert
and Sullivan were English.

01:20.415 --> 01:22.705
- I knew that.
- You knew that?

Isn't this cool? We're

Bet we're the only one of
our friends that can say that.

01:53.072 --> 01:55.192
David, I'm wondering how
the trucks made it back here.

01:55.283 --> 01:58.333
- I'm sure they did.
- Yeah, I gave them directions.

01:58.495 --> 02:00.365
But I also said
we'd be there to supervise.

02:00.538 --> 02:02.778
I didn't know we were gonna
be stopping for strawberries.

02:02.916 --> 02:04.626
- I wanted to stop.
- Peas.

02:04.793 --> 02:07.003
- I'd never done roadside stands.
- Spinach.

02:07.170 --> 02:09.340
- It was important for Lucas.
- And asparagus.

02:09.506 --> 02:11.546
He should know
where food comes from.

02:11.716 --> 02:14.426
David, food comes from farms,
not stands.

02:14.594 --> 02:17.894
- They both have farmers.
- I think I see a light.

02:25.688 --> 02:27.108
Where are we?

02:27.273 --> 02:28.693
Hey, we're home, peanut.

02:28.858 --> 02:30.238
It's really dark.

02:30.401 --> 02:32.531
Where are
all the apartment buildings?

02:32.695 --> 02:35.655
They don't have apartments
in the country, baby.

02:49.254 --> 02:51.764
Babe? Dana.

02:52.799 --> 02:56.549
It's a good move. Believe me?

02:56.719 --> 02:58.969
Yeah, I believe you.

02:59.138 --> 03:01.058
OK.

03:01.224 --> 03:03.274
New beginning.

03:04.686 --> 03:06.726
New beginning.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.397
Ugh!

03:21.578 --> 03:24.158
Oh, my God.

03:24.330 --> 03:27.330
- Shit.
- My God. You kidding me?

03:27.500 --> 03:30.000
They were supposed to put
everything in the right rooms.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.919
Well, obviously
they didn't.

03:38.511 --> 03:40.641
Hey, peanut, last one

03:40.805 --> 03:42.715
to find the bathroom has
to go wee in the woods!

03:42.891 --> 03:44.431
Hot on your heels!
Hot on your heels!

03:44.601 --> 03:45.981
Here I come! Here I come!

03:46.144 --> 03:47.984
Please be careful!

03:49.230 --> 03:52.070
Here he goes!
Here he goes! Here he goes!

04:39.197 --> 04:41.567
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:42.617 --> 04:44.577
Who puts mirrors like this here?

04:44.744 --> 04:47.084
Oh, some guy
who's got a hot wife

04:47.246 --> 04:49.576
and wants as many
of her as possible.

04:57.757 --> 04:59.587
Daddy!

05:00.802 --> 05:02.802
I can't find my toys!

07:36.499 --> 07:39.039
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:39.210 --> 07:41.380
This kitchen has potential, huh?

07:42.421 --> 07:44.671
- Yes.
- Is there any coffee going?

07:44.841 --> 07:46.261
Oh, if you want coffee,

07:46.425 --> 07:48.335
you're gonna have to find
the coffeemaker first.

07:48.511 --> 07:50.431
- Found her.
- Fuck you.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.926
Is that a threat? Or a promise?

07:53.099 --> 07:55.639
It could be a promising threat.

07:55.810 --> 07:57.600
Or a threatening promise.

07:59.188 --> 08:00.568
Where's the peanut?

08:00.731 --> 08:02.901
He's upstairs,
waiting for his waffles.

08:03.067 --> 08:06.317
Oh, and we have a leak
in the breakfast room.

08:20.293 --> 08:22.003
I don't know.

08:24.172 --> 08:27.432
I don't know.
We have to wait and see.

08:28.467 --> 08:31.007
No, she's a nice mommy,

08:31.179 --> 08:33.849
the nicest mommy in the world.

08:34.890 --> 08:37.140
Lucas,
who are you talking to?

08:39.102 --> 08:41.063
Baby, I asked you a question.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.690
Who were you talking to
just now?

08:44.734 --> 08:46.574
Lucas, turn around.

08:49.864 --> 08:54.374
Oh, no! Lucas!

08:54.535 --> 08:56.785
Oh, where did you even
find that thing?

08:56.954 --> 08:59.584
He lives here. This is his home.

08:59.749 --> 09:01.669
Oh, well, I'm sure
he'll be even happier

09:01.834 --> 09:03.544
when we take him outside.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.421
He said he'll protect me!

09:05.588 --> 09:07.668
Baby, I'm sure he did.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.880
We've talked about this before.
OK. No pets.

09:10.051 --> 09:11.591
Please, Mommy?

09:11.761 --> 09:13.971
Hey,
where'd that come from?

09:14.138 --> 09:16.968
Hey, hey, hey.
Let me have a go at that.

09:17.141 --> 09:19.231
Aww.

09:20.269 --> 09:22.519
Hey, you stink, little guy.

09:22.688 --> 09:26.528
Guess what? I just saw a mouse
downstairs and it was huge!

09:26.692 --> 09:28.862
And he had his nose
in the waffle cupboard!

09:29.028 --> 09:32.238
So guess we could use
a good mouser, babe.

09:33.282 --> 09:36.202
Yeah, he's a really good mouser.

09:36.369 --> 09:37.949
Hey.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.040
Hold still, you little rascal.

09:40.206 --> 09:42.576
Hey, how about Rascal?
Rascal's a good name.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.210
Yeah, I think it's a cool name.

09:45.378 --> 09:47.668
Oh... Ooh!

11:22.141 --> 11:24.891
Hey, Dana, what
do you say we drive into town,

11:25.061 --> 11:27.271
get some groceries,
lay of the land?

11:27.438 --> 11:30.318
- There's something out here.
- We live in the country now.

11:30.483 --> 11:32.443
All kinds of crazy critters
out there.

11:32.610 --> 11:34.820
Like what?

11:34.987 --> 11:36.857
Maybe it's a raccoon,

11:37.031 --> 11:39.451
the occasional zombie redneck.

11:40.493 --> 11:41.873
Hey, Dana, come on.

11:42.036 --> 11:43.946
I'm sure the locals
are eager to sneak a peek

11:44.121 --> 11:46.211
at the new lord and lady
of the manor.

12:06.143 --> 12:09.023
Not bad, huh?
Not bad at all.

12:09.188 --> 12:11.318
This is cool, hey?

12:11.482 --> 12:13.402
Where's
the movie theatre?

12:13.567 --> 12:15.527
They don't have one, peanut,
but what they do have

12:15.653 --> 12:17.573
is a 6-plex
up the road in New Bern.

12:17.738 --> 12:20.068
- Afternoon.
- Oh, afternoon.

12:21.117 --> 12:22.907
You see that? Friendly.

12:24.787 --> 12:28.537
Look at that. That's
a genuine barber shop. Huh?

12:29.583 --> 12:31.923
Ahh, friendly
neighbourhood gun store.

12:32.086 --> 12:34.336
We'll go wild turkey shooting.
How about that?

12:34.505 --> 12:36.415
Did you forget?
I'm a vegetarian.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.880
I do not like killing animals.

12:39.051 --> 12:41.113
You don't? That's OK.
We'll shoot watermelons instead.

12:41.137 --> 12:43.057
Hey! I've heard
about this place.

12:43.222 --> 12:45.142
Yelp says that this place
has the best ice-cream

12:45.307 --> 12:46.807
this side of the Mississippi.

12:46.976 --> 12:48.516
- No way! Really?
- Yeah.

12:48.686 --> 12:50.486
Better than the
Ice Cream Factory in Brooklyn.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.187
Afternoon!

12:55.359 --> 12:56.779
- Hello.
- Hey.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.034
I bet I know who you all are.

12:59.196 --> 13:02.316
- I bet you do.
- You bought the Blacker House.

13:02.491 --> 13:05.161
- Yeah, that's us.
- Oh, welcome!

13:05.327 --> 13:07.537
Welcome! Welcome!

13:07.705 --> 13:10.705
Oh, I'm so happy to see
some new faces around here.

13:10.875 --> 13:13.245
We're happy to be a new face.
Hey, I'm David.

13:13.419 --> 13:15.339
- David.
- This is my wife Dana.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.094
- Hi.
- How are you?

13:17.256 --> 13:19.317
And this little sugar addict
over here is our son Lucas.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.511
- Hey, get up.
- Marti Morrison!

13:21.677 --> 13:24.007
And the pleasure is all mine.

13:24.180 --> 13:26.100
- And hi, Lucas.
- Hi.

13:26.265 --> 13:28.225
What's your
favourite ice-cream?

13:28.392 --> 13:31.192
- Strawberry.
- You are so in luck.

13:31.353 --> 13:34.153
I just made some strawberry
this morning.

13:34.315 --> 13:36.435
- Is that OK?
- Yeah. It's fine.

13:36.609 --> 13:40.029
- Sure.
- Alright, let's get scoopin'.

13:40.196 --> 13:42.946
You know, nobody
has lived in that old house

13:43.115 --> 13:45.025
for quite some time.

13:45.201 --> 13:48.121
I'm afraid that you all have
your work cut out for you.

13:48.287 --> 13:50.917
Yup. Got a leaky roof,
for starters.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.001
Oh, now, listen,
if you need

13:53.167 --> 13:55.167
some help
with the big stuff,

13:55.336 --> 13:57.246
I mean, I'm happy
to recommend

13:57.421 --> 13:59.801
some honest, hardworking people.

13:59.965 --> 14:02.255
- You know, actually, we're...
- Ben Philips Jr.

14:02.426 --> 14:05.096
Now, that's not to be confused
with Ben Philips Sr,

14:05.262 --> 14:07.222
who drinks - enough said.

14:07.389 --> 14:10.939
But Ben Jr, now, he knows
his way around a hammer.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.311
And he is not bad to look at.

14:13.479 --> 14:15.899
I said that out loud, didn't I?
That's awful.

14:16.065 --> 14:18.645
Oh, get behind me, Satan.
That's terrible.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.817
Actually, we were hoping to do
most of the work ourselves.

14:21.987 --> 14:25.617
Oh, is that right? Well, are you
some kinda architect, or...?

14:25.783 --> 14:28.873
- Well, funnily enough...
- Look at you!

14:29.036 --> 14:31.156
Oh, I guess
that you're a man

14:31.330 --> 14:33.670
who knows his way
around a hammer too.

14:33.832 --> 14:36.882
I do.
I'm actually the architect.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.634
I'm gonna be doing most
of the work on the house.

14:39.797 --> 14:42.007
Is that right?

14:42.174 --> 14:44.094
Yeah, that's right.

14:44.260 --> 14:46.760
- It's a big job.
- Big job.

14:46.929 --> 14:50.099
And what is it that you do?

14:50.266 --> 14:52.686
In between my naps?

14:52.851 --> 14:57.521
I enjoy watching her work,
playing Xbox.

14:57.690 --> 15:00.190
Oh, huh?

15:00.359 --> 15:02.109
We actually just came in
to say howdy,

15:02.278 --> 15:03.858
pick up a few things
for the house.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.779
Well, howdy.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.738
And just look around.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.988
Let me know
if you can't find something.

15:11.036 --> 15:14.536
And good luck with your house.

16:00.628 --> 16:02.298
Lucas?

16:03.797 --> 16:05.877
Lucas?

16:07.259 --> 16:10.299
- Lucas, what is it?
- There's a dog out there.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.893
It's probably just a stray.

16:17.353 --> 16:20.063
I'm scared.

16:23.317 --> 16:27.107
Oh, it's alright, peanut.
I'll protect you.

16:27.279 --> 16:29.659
Mommy will protect you.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.529
Mommy?

16:34.536 --> 16:36.036
Mommy!

16:36.205 --> 16:37.995
Oh, my God!

16:38.165 --> 16:40.495
Lucas! Lucas!

16:45.255 --> 16:46.755
David...

16:46.924 --> 16:48.844
Mmm.

16:49.009 --> 16:52.049
I had one of my dreams.

20:50.918 --> 20:52.838
Shit.

21:18.195 --> 21:20.275
Dana, are you OK?

21:20.447 --> 21:23.237
Yeah, David, I'm up here.
I need your help.

21:29.873 --> 21:32.383
Where's the lion and the witch?

21:32.542 --> 21:35.712
Well, technically,
it's called a chifferobe.

21:35.879 --> 21:38.509
Yeah, chifferobe, huh?
What's it made of, lead?

21:38.674 --> 21:40.724
You're positive
you saw a light up in here?

21:40.884 --> 21:42.844
Yes. And then it went off.

21:43.011 --> 21:44.851
May I ask
what you were doing outside

21:45.013 --> 21:46.933
in the middle of the night,
young lady?

21:47.099 --> 21:49.019
I was getting some air.

21:49.184 --> 21:51.984
It's probably just
a faulty wire or something.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.725
Well, all the more reason
to check it out.

21:54.898 --> 21:57.568
- Oh, wow.
- Cool.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.904
Our own secret room.

22:00.070 --> 22:02.070
Argh! Of course!

22:02.239 --> 22:04.739
- Locked?
- Yeah, or stuck.

22:08.412 --> 22:10.082
See anything?

22:11.456 --> 22:13.206
No, it's too dark.

22:18.005 --> 22:19.715
Hey, Dana, come on up.

22:19.881 --> 22:22.801
We'll find a locksmith
in the morning to get it open.

22:27.222 --> 22:29.732
Hey, Dana. Hey, Dana, come on.

22:32.644 --> 22:34.564
Come on. It's late. Stop.

22:34.730 --> 22:36.520
What?

22:36.690 --> 22:38.940
Hey, you OK?

22:39.109 --> 22:41.029
Yeah.

22:41.194 --> 22:44.204
You got that look
that concerns me.

22:45.782 --> 22:47.832
You want me to call
Dr Ashby in the morning?

22:47.993 --> 22:49.913
- No. God, no.
- Sorry.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.038
I'm just... I'm getting adjusted.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.115
That room's
not on the floor plan

22:54.291 --> 22:55.831
and it's bugging me
a little bit.

23:35.916 --> 23:38.456
I'm feeling Wolverine hungry.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.517
- Oh! Come on!
- Never!

23:52.682 --> 23:54.602
You parsley-looking mutant!

25:37.078 --> 25:39.158
Goddamnit!

25:43.293 --> 25:45.883
Fuck you too.

26:25.919 --> 26:27.549
David?

26:41.893 --> 26:43.693
Lucas, is that you?

26:43.853 --> 26:45.773
Lucas?

27:37.032 --> 27:40.332
David, please let me out
of here! Please let me out!

27:40.493 --> 27:44.293
David! David! David! David!

27:44.456 --> 27:46.206
Let me out of here!

27:46.374 --> 27:48.214
David! David!

27:48.376 --> 27:51.086
Please let me out! David!

27:51.254 --> 27:53.844
David, please!

29:03.410 --> 29:05.120
He doesn't want you here.

29:43.408 --> 29:46.488
<i>That, gentlemen, is my wife.</i>

29:46.661 --> 29:50.041
<i>Mad, and the offspring
of a mad family.</i>

29:52.750 --> 29:55.000
Round. Round. Get it back round.
Reverse. Reverse.

29:55.170 --> 29:57.090
That's right, move it back.
Move it back.

29:57.255 --> 29:59.165
Back room, back room,
back room.

29:59.340 --> 30:02.010
Hey, baba.
Where'd you come from?

30:02.177 --> 30:04.177
Where were you?

30:06.514 --> 30:08.144
I needed you, David.

30:08.308 --> 30:11.558
Babe, I'm right here.
I've been right here.

30:11.728 --> 30:16.648
I was locked up. I was locked up
there for hours and hours!

30:16.816 --> 30:18.396
Dana, Dana, I don't...

30:18.568 --> 30:20.568
You didn't notice I was missing?

30:20.737 --> 30:22.407
Dana, I swear to God...

30:22.572 --> 30:23.992
I was upstairs, David.

30:24.157 --> 30:25.757
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.735
I was upstairs, David,
I was locked

30:27.911 --> 30:29.661
in that little room
in the attic.

30:29.829 --> 30:31.959
Hey, wait, wait. You got in?

30:32.123 --> 30:34.003
Yeah, I found the key
and I went inside...

30:34.167 --> 30:35.787
Dana.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.510
..and then somebody...
somebody closed the door.

30:38.671 --> 30:41.971
- Somebody locked me in.
- Nobody would do that.

30:42.133 --> 30:44.843
- Who was it, David?!
- I don't know!

30:46.471 --> 30:48.391
There's no-one else here.

30:54.812 --> 30:57.822
I was screaming for help
for hours.

30:57.982 --> 31:00.242
Dana, we have been down here
the whole time

31:00.401 --> 31:02.901
and we did not hear a thing.

31:03.071 --> 31:04.701
Honest to God.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.824
We didn't hear a thing, Mommy.

31:06.991 --> 31:09.121
We didn't.

31:13.665 --> 31:15.575
Hey...

31:15.750 --> 31:17.750
..you having trouble sleeping?

31:17.919 --> 31:20.759
No. I... No, I'm not
having trouble sleeping.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.052
Please don't look at me
like that.

31:23.216 --> 31:24.796
Like what?

31:24.968 --> 31:27.048
Don't get sick again, Mommy.

31:28.429 --> 31:32.309
I'm not getting sick, baby.
I never felt better in my life.

31:38.940 --> 31:41.480
Hey... Dana.

31:43.570 --> 31:45.320
It's OK.

32:01.546 --> 32:05.376
Hey. Where's Daddy?

32:05.550 --> 32:09.010
He had to make a phone call
to Japan.

32:10.054 --> 32:12.394
Well, I was thinking, um...

32:12.557 --> 32:15.177
..I could set up your house
for you if you want.

32:16.853 --> 32:19.363
I mean,
you could help if you want.

32:19.522 --> 32:22.442
- OK.
- OK.

32:26.738 --> 32:29.528
OK, you remember
how this goes together?

32:29.699 --> 32:32.329
- No.
- It's OK. It's complicated.

32:32.493 --> 32:37.003
As were the clients
if your mom remembers correctly.

32:37.165 --> 32:39.705
OK, first things first,
we start with the base.

32:45.548 --> 32:48.588
You gonna do it by yourself?
You do it all by yourself.

32:50.470 --> 32:52.600
- Very nice.
- Oh.

32:52.764 --> 32:55.894
- How about... that one?
- That.

32:56.934 --> 32:59.854
Good job. And...

33:00.021 --> 33:02.191
That big boy.

33:03.232 --> 33:05.112
Couple more pieces to go.

33:07.528 --> 33:09.158
- What do you think?
- That one.

33:09.322 --> 33:10.702
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

33:10.865 --> 33:12.615
- You got it?
- Yep.

33:15.036 --> 33:17.406
That one. You got it?

33:22.251 --> 33:24.671
- Yes. Very good.
- Yes.

33:43.022 --> 33:45.442
- Lucas?
- Yeah.

33:49.153 --> 33:53.833
I just, um...
I just wanted to tell you...

33:56.661 --> 33:59.621
..I just wanted to say
I'm sorry.

33:59.789 --> 34:02.419
That's OK.

34:02.583 --> 34:04.963
Sometimes bad things happen

34:05.128 --> 34:07.048
and you don't know why.

34:07.213 --> 34:10.053
Yeah.

34:11.467 --> 34:13.387
Yeah, that's very true.

34:13.553 --> 34:16.263
I think sometimes...

34:17.306 --> 34:19.976
..maybe I'd like a sister again.

34:20.143 --> 34:23.402
You would?

34:28.985 --> 34:31.195
Ohhh.

34:33.822 --> 34:36.663
Tickle the toes.
Tickle the toes.

34:36.826 --> 34:38.696
You don't speak baby?

34:38.870 --> 34:41.370
- Not anymore.
- No?

34:46.127 --> 34:50.717
Baby selfie. Baby selfie.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.628
Oh.

35:54.862 --> 35:56.492
Don't come back here!

36:08.835 --> 36:12.085
You think that child was
begotten of my loins rotten?

36:12.255 --> 36:15.215
He won't let us out.

36:15.383 --> 36:16.973
Not a chance in hell.

36:17.134 --> 36:19.974
Mommy. Mommy.

36:20.137 --> 36:22.267
Can I have my breakfast, Mommy?

36:23.641 --> 36:27.061
Yes, Lucas,
you can have your breakfast.

38:40.778 --> 38:42.408
- Oh!
- God!

38:42.571 --> 38:45.321
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Oh, for God's sake.

38:45.491 --> 38:47.851
I really am sorry, ma'am. I...
I wouldn't scare you too bad.

38:47.910 --> 38:50.370
That wasn't...
was not my intention.

38:50.538 --> 38:54.378
Who are you? What are you doing
sneaking around on my property?

38:55.418 --> 38:57.208
Answering your prayers.

38:59.422 --> 39:01.302
See, it's gone
unchecked for a while.

39:01.465 --> 39:06.215
Lucky it didn't cave.
Lucky I stopped by when I did.

39:06.387 --> 39:09.267
Well, and lucky for you people
around here like to gossip.

39:09.432 --> 39:11.522
That they do.

39:13.436 --> 39:16.516
Also heard you were
an architect or... or something.

39:16.689 --> 39:19.029
Yeah. Or something.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.320
Well, maybe
we should talk about money.

39:23.487 --> 39:25.157
Well, that's a little premature.

39:25.322 --> 39:28.452
- Come again?
- You haven't been hired yet.

39:28.617 --> 39:30.407
No?

39:30.578 --> 39:32.868
No.

39:33.039 --> 39:35.419
Look, there's nothing
I can do to change your mind?

39:35.583 --> 39:37.793
- Hello.
- David.

39:37.960 --> 39:42.090
This is my husband, David.
David, this is Ben Philips Jr.

39:42.256 --> 39:44.926
Yes, the legend. Hey.

39:45.092 --> 39:46.762
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

39:46.927 --> 39:49.427
Mr Philips is here
about the leak.

39:49.597 --> 39:51.597
- Right.
- Ben works fine.

39:51.766 --> 39:54.386
Great, Ben.
When can you start?

39:54.560 --> 39:57.520
- No, that's still up in the air.
- Soon as you pull the trigger.

39:57.688 --> 39:59.898
We should probably get
onto this right away, babe.

40:00.066 --> 40:02.066
- Don't you think?
- David.

40:02.234 --> 40:04.864
Next couple of weeks are
kinda busy, but I am free now.

40:05.029 --> 40:06.949
What it this?
This is water damage, right?

40:07.114 --> 40:09.176
- Does this floor need to go?
- We get a dehumidifier.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.720
We can actually save
most of this wood.

40:10.868 --> 40:12.288
- Just say the word.
- Great.

40:12.453 --> 40:14.833
- Start as soon as possible.
- Alright.

40:14.997 --> 40:17.207
No, what I would like
is for Mr Philips to come back

40:17.374 --> 40:19.294
when it hasn't been raining
for a few days

40:19.460 --> 40:22.460
and the two of us can get up on
that roof and see what's what.

40:22.630 --> 40:24.170
That way, once the situation's

40:24.340 --> 40:25.840
been thoroughly
and properly assessed,

40:26.008 --> 40:27.928
then we can talk about hours
and materials

40:28.094 --> 40:30.014
and scope of work in a manner

40:30.179 --> 40:32.639
that's not been pulled
directly out of our asses.

40:32.807 --> 40:34.727
And what I'd also like
is to agree

40:34.892 --> 40:36.892
on a deadline,
which, if not met,

40:37.061 --> 40:38.981
means revisiting
the terms of our contract

40:39.146 --> 40:41.566
with the probability
of penalties paid to us by you

40:41.732 --> 40:44.532
for each day of work exceeding
the original agreement.

40:44.693 --> 40:47.073
If that all sounds acceptable,
then I'd be happy to resume

40:47.238 --> 40:49.948
this conversation at a later
date, but in the meantime,

40:50.116 --> 40:52.116
it was a pleasure meeting you,
Mr Philips.

40:52.284 --> 40:55.454
And my husband David
will show you out.

40:55.621 --> 40:57.291
David, if you wouldn't mind.

41:01.627 --> 41:03.337
Ben.

41:44.044 --> 41:46.134
July 5.

41:49.008 --> 41:50.928
I'm sorry.

41:52.469 --> 41:53.969
What are you sorry for?

41:54.138 --> 41:56.018
I should've
let you take the lead.

41:57.057 --> 41:59.347
It's not a big deal.

41:59.518 --> 42:02.898
Yes, it is. I was totally
caveman about the whole thing.

42:03.063 --> 42:04.983
It was a full-on phallus fest.

42:05.149 --> 42:08.359
I mean, my God,
what was I doing?

42:08.527 --> 42:10.817
I don't know anything
about fixing a fucking roof.

42:10.988 --> 42:15.158
I wanna leave this house.
Something isn't right here.

42:15.326 --> 42:17.406
Dana...

42:18.495 --> 42:21.245
Whatever you're feeling
or think you're experiencing,

42:21.415 --> 42:23.955
it's just you adjusting,
it's not the house.

42:24.126 --> 42:27.836
The Blackers had a daughter
who died July 5th.

42:28.005 --> 42:30.215
That's the same day, David.

42:31.383 --> 42:34.603
The same day!
That's not a coincidence!

42:36.138 --> 42:38.218
Their daughter's
still in this house.

42:43.771 --> 42:48.151
That's not possible.
You know that.

42:49.818 --> 42:51.318
You're still taking
your medication?

42:51.487 --> 42:54.107
Yes, I'm taking it.
I don't wanna stay here.

42:54.281 --> 42:57.831
We agreed to give it a year
of our time in this house.

42:57.993 --> 43:00.043
Dr Ashby told us
how important it was

43:00.204 --> 43:02.964
for Lucas to have stability
right now.

43:05.626 --> 43:07.496
If we bail on this house,

43:07.670 --> 43:09.710
we're not giving him
a fair chance of a normal life.

43:09.755 --> 43:12.625
We owe him that.
God knows, we owe him that.

43:14.009 --> 43:16.219
In a year's time
we're gonna look back at this

43:16.387 --> 43:19.347
and know that this move
was the right thing to do.

43:21.809 --> 43:23.479
Believe me?

43:24.853 --> 43:27.023
Yeah, I believe you.

43:31.151 --> 43:33.071
I can cancel
this trip in the city.

43:33.237 --> 43:35.697
It's just two days, finalise
the sale of the company,

43:35.864 --> 43:37.914
help with the transition.

43:38.951 --> 43:40.581
- I can reschedule.
- No. No.

43:40.744 --> 43:42.714
I don't want you to do that.

43:43.747 --> 43:46.207
Lucas and I
can spend the time together.

43:46.375 --> 43:48.995
That'll be...
That'll be good for us.

43:56.927 --> 43:58.847
I want you to keep an eye
on your mother for me

43:59.013 --> 44:00.933
while I'm gone, look after her.

44:01.098 --> 44:03.451
You want me to pick up some
Junior's for you while I'm gone?

44:03.475 --> 44:05.595
With strawberries!
No raspberries!

44:05.769 --> 44:07.309
Yes, sir.

44:18.866 --> 44:20.526
Be careful.

44:23.996 --> 44:26.076
Oh, wow.
Look at that bear!

44:28.125 --> 44:30.125
Look, there's our house.

44:30.294 --> 44:32.054
Oh, yeah. Good job.

44:32.212 --> 44:33.712
May I help you?

44:33.881 --> 44:36.221
Oh, er, yeah.

44:36.383 --> 44:38.143
I'm Dana Barrow and I...

44:38.302 --> 44:40.682
Dana, the architect!
It's nice to meet you, Dana.

44:40.846 --> 44:42.766
I'm the one who sent you
the photographs

44:42.931 --> 44:44.561
and records of your house.

44:44.725 --> 44:48.055
- Oh, thank you.
- And who might you be?

44:49.104 --> 44:51.074
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

44:51.231 --> 44:54.321
- This is Lucas.
- They call me Ms Judith.

44:54.485 --> 44:57.815
- Say hi.
- I'll just go put these away.

44:57.988 --> 45:01.868
Oh, OK. You can play over here.
I'll just be a few minutes.

45:07.456 --> 45:09.416
I just...
I wanted to ask you about

45:09.583 --> 45:13.003
this little room
that I found in the attic.

45:14.380 --> 45:17.880
It's got a metal floor
and a window that won't open

45:18.050 --> 45:23.100
and, um, a door that just
only locks from the outside.

45:23.263 --> 45:25.183
And it... it really...

45:25.349 --> 45:27.849
It frightens me and it wasn't
on any of the plans,

45:28.018 --> 45:30.228
and I... you know, I don't know
what to make of it.

45:30.396 --> 45:33.146
But... but it's ridiculous.

45:33.315 --> 45:35.225
Maybe.

45:36.443 --> 45:38.113
Maybe not.

45:39.154 --> 45:41.034
What do you mean?

45:42.074 --> 45:46.754
Dana, it sounds like you have
a disappointments room.

45:47.788 --> 45:49.328
A what?

45:49.498 --> 45:52.128
A disappointments room.

45:52.292 --> 45:54.672
Well, what does that mean?

45:56.130 --> 45:59.130
There was a time
not so long ago

45:59.299 --> 46:02.339
when children who were born
with certain difficulties

46:02.511 --> 46:04.811
were considered embarrassing...

46:06.473 --> 46:10.483
..especially if the family was
well-to-do, prominent socially.

46:12.646 --> 46:14.606
Sometimes a decision
would be made

46:14.773 --> 46:17.483
to keep that child's
very existence a secret.

46:18.944 --> 46:20.324
Go on.

46:20.487 --> 46:22.277
So, confined to a room

46:22.448 --> 46:24.368
much like the one
you described,

46:24.533 --> 46:27.793
tended to only by the parents
or perhaps a trusted servant,

46:27.953 --> 46:30.293
that boy or girl
would spend their lives,

46:30.456 --> 46:32.956
however long those might be.

46:33.125 --> 46:35.955
No-one to talk to.
No-one to play with.

46:36.128 --> 46:39.628
Never feeling the sun or the
rain on their little faces.

46:39.798 --> 46:41.928
These children were...

46:43.927 --> 46:46.007
Disappointments.

46:46.180 --> 46:47.930
Their time on this earth

46:48.098 --> 46:50.178
was frequently brief,
God willing.

46:50.350 --> 46:53.980
Then when it was over,
they were buried. Discreetly.

46:54.146 --> 46:57.686
Some say their spirits
could remain behind.

46:58.775 --> 47:00.895
So I've been researching

47:01.069 --> 47:04.449
the presence of disturbed
spirits in these old homes.

47:04.615 --> 47:06.275
And?

47:06.450 --> 47:08.740
And...

47:09.912 --> 47:12.792
I think I've watched
'Poltergeist' too many times.

47:12.956 --> 47:16.626
People say
I'm full of shit and whiskey.

47:41.860 --> 47:43.610
Hello?

47:44.655 --> 47:46.445
Hello yourself!

47:46.615 --> 47:48.485
What are you doing up there?

47:48.659 --> 47:51.449
Thought you said to come back
in a few days.

48:01.797 --> 48:03.417
So what are you thinking?

48:03.590 --> 48:05.510
I think
all this needs to go.

48:05.676 --> 48:08.886
I say we demo the existing
and build a new one with pitch.

48:09.054 --> 48:10.644
Better drainage.

48:10.806 --> 48:12.926
- Standard per foot?
- Quarter inch.

48:13.100 --> 48:16.400
Fir strips, plywood,
new flashing, new tar paper.

48:16.562 --> 48:18.152
I'd say it's a four-day job.

48:18.313 --> 48:20.443
Oh, I'd say a two-day job. Max.

48:20.607 --> 48:23.607
- Well, I bill 80 bucks an hour.
- Well, you'll get 60.

48:23.777 --> 48:27.567
So, 2 days, 60,
500 for materials -

48:27.739 --> 48:30.119
that's $1,460, max.

48:30.284 --> 48:32.124
You don't talk
like an architect.

48:32.286 --> 48:34.996
My father worked as a general
contractor for over 40 years.

48:35.163 --> 48:37.043
- Is that right?
- That's right.

48:37.207 --> 48:39.127
And he didn't like
leaving me with babysitters,

48:39.293 --> 48:41.003
so I've spent
a lot of time on-site,

48:41.169 --> 48:43.339
and a lot of time
around young men like you.

48:45.007 --> 48:48.387
So then you're used to seeing
people smoke on the job site.

48:50.804 --> 48:53.024
When did you start
working for your daddy?

48:53.181 --> 48:55.731
- When I was old enough.
- Doing what?

48:55.892 --> 48:57.812
Whatever he'd let me do.

48:57.978 --> 49:00.518
- He must have been proud.
- Of?

49:00.689 --> 49:03.399
Of you, getting a degree,
becoming an architect.

49:04.610 --> 49:07.030
Actually, he, er... he had
a heart attack on the job

49:07.195 --> 49:09.615
a few months
after I graduated, so...

49:09.781 --> 49:11.871
Sorry to hear about that.

49:13.535 --> 49:15.285
He died getting his hands dirty.

49:17.664 --> 49:19.124
Just like he wanted?

49:19.291 --> 49:21.541
I guess so.

49:23.337 --> 49:25.257
- So what about your mom...
- Mommy!

49:25.422 --> 49:27.483
Do not come up here,
Lucas! Stay right where you are.

49:27.507 --> 49:29.427
- I'm hungry now!
- I'll be right down.

49:29.593 --> 49:31.473
Just get off that ladder,
please.

49:33.347 --> 49:34.927
OK.

49:39.269 --> 49:41.189
- Where's his father?
- He's in the city.

49:41.355 --> 49:43.265
Coming home soon?

49:43.440 --> 49:45.860
Yeah, in a few days.

49:46.026 --> 49:47.936
Yeah.

49:48.111 --> 49:50.031
I bet it's scary at night,

49:50.197 --> 49:52.567
tucked up in bed
all by yourself.

49:54.201 --> 49:56.791
Congratulations.
You just found the line.

49:56.953 --> 49:59.923
Oh, yeah? So now what?

50:00.082 --> 50:02.792
Now you can back the fuck up.

50:02.959 --> 50:06.379
You can start in the morning.
I'll expect you around eight.

Rascal! Rascal! Rascal!
Where are you, Rascal?

52:01.411 --> 52:04.291
Lucas! Are you up there?

52:04.456 --> 52:07.206
Lucas!

52:08.251 --> 52:10.881
Lucas, we're not playing games
right now, honey.

52:15.967 --> 52:19.137
Lucas?

52:26.561 --> 52:28.941
Oh, my God.

52:33.193 --> 52:34.783
What's your name?

52:37.239 --> 52:39.159
Can you tell me your name?

52:39.324 --> 52:41.084
Laura.

52:43.662 --> 52:45.292
He doesn't want you here.

52:46.373 --> 52:48.333
Who?

54:00.697 --> 54:02.157
- Arggh!
- Lucas!

54:04.242 --> 54:06.872
Lucas!

54:07.037 --> 54:08.907
- Argh!
- Lucas!

54:09.080 --> 54:10.500
Arggh!

54:13.335 --> 54:15.875
- Arggh!
- Lucas!

54:18.214 --> 54:19.474
Arggh!

54:20.884 --> 54:22.554
Mom!

54:25.889 --> 54:27.429
Lucas!

54:37.567 --> 54:40.027
Oh, Lucas. Lucas.

54:43.323 --> 54:45.163
Did you see that?

54:47.077 --> 54:50.867
Never mind. Come on.
Let's go inside for lunch.

54:51.039 --> 54:54.539
Mommy, wait! I need
Rascal. He came out with me.

54:54.709 --> 54:57.169
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
We'll go together.

55:00.590 --> 55:02.050
Rascal!

55:02.217 --> 55:04.137
Rascal!

55:04.302 --> 55:07.762
Rascal! Rascal!

55:07.931 --> 55:10.561
Hey, baby, why don't you
go look in those trees?

55:10.725 --> 55:12.885
- He's a really good climber.
- OK.

55:14.062 --> 55:16.362
Rascal! Rascal!

55:16.523 --> 55:20.403
Where are you?! Rascal!

55:20.568 --> 55:22.488
Rascal!

55:22.654 --> 55:25.494
Come down, wherever you are.
Come down, kitty, kitty.

55:26.533 --> 55:28.743
Where are you?

55:41.840 --> 55:44.300
- Mommy, I can't see him.
- Why don't you look over there?

55:44.467 --> 55:46.137
I think I heard him.

55:53.893 --> 55:55.813
He's not out here, baby.

55:55.979 --> 55:58.769
He's probably back in the house
skitching about.

55:58.940 --> 56:02.280
- We'll find him?
- Yeah, we'll find him.

56:29.763 --> 56:31.643
Oh, shit.

57:54.222 --> 57:56.102
Dana!

57:57.600 --> 57:59.850
Dana! Dana!

58:01.104 --> 58:03.484
Shit! Stop! Hey.

58:03.648 --> 58:05.228
Hey. I got you.

58:05.400 --> 58:07.610
Hey, Dana.

58:14.701 --> 58:16.831
I feel like
she's slipping.

58:17.871 --> 58:20.371
She had a few episodes

58:20.540 --> 58:23.290
where she completely
lost track of time.

58:25.753 --> 58:28.803
She thinks that odd things
are going on in the house.

58:29.841 --> 58:32.011
Odd in what way?

58:34.262 --> 58:36.182
She started to imagine things

58:36.347 --> 58:38.467
that aren't
really happening again.

58:44.480 --> 58:47.690
Catherine's birthday
would have been Sunday, right?

58:51.946 --> 58:53.616
Yeah.

58:57.744 --> 59:00.544
We both know that you tend
to bury your feelings

59:00.705 --> 59:04.535
for the greater good and that
is not good for you either.

59:04.709 --> 59:06.709
Being out in that big house

59:06.878 --> 59:10.218
way outside of the city
is very isolating.

59:10.381 --> 59:14.051
Why don't you have people over
on Sunday?

59:14.219 --> 59:18.179
She doesn't need advice.
She needs friends.

59:22.060 --> 59:23.650
OK.

59:41.496 --> 59:45.876
Um, there's a gravestone
out back.

59:46.042 --> 59:48.712
It's probably an old dog's,
but it scares Lucas.

59:48.878 --> 59:51.168
Would you dig it up
and make sure it's nothing?

59:52.257 --> 59:55.007
I don't want David to know.

59:57.345 --> 59:58.845
Yeah.

59:59.013 --> 01:00:00.563
Then I'll do that.

01:00:00.723 --> 01:00:03.563
I sure hope he appreciates
all this.

01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:12.941
I said I sure hope
he appreciates all this.

01:00:13.111 --> 01:00:15.151
I hope he appreciates
all that you're doing for him.

01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:17.241
What am I doing?

01:00:17.407 --> 01:00:20.407
Leaving the city, buying
the old house in the country.

01:00:20.576 --> 01:00:23.156
You're fixing it up so
you can throw some big dinners,

01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:25.499
everyone gathered around
your beautiful Stickley table,

01:00:25.665 --> 01:00:27.575
eating vegetables
you grew out back

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:29.920
or bought at the corner
at the farmer stand.

01:00:30.086 --> 01:00:32.206
Wasn't that the plan?

01:00:34.966 --> 01:00:36.876
Yeah. Or something.

01:00:41.306 --> 01:00:44.266
How would your girlfriend feel
about us sharing a smoke?

01:00:44.434 --> 01:00:46.354
I don't have one.

01:00:46.519 --> 01:00:48.979
And if I did, I probably
wouldn't care what she thought.

01:00:49.147 --> 01:00:51.227
Why not?

01:00:52.317 --> 01:00:55.397
I don't live my life worrying
about things I can't control.

01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:57.910
And how's that
working out for you?

01:00:58.072 --> 01:01:00.912
It works out
just fine.

01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:02.985
Keep me working around here
long enough,

01:01:03.161 --> 01:01:07.371
you might get to see or feel
how it works out for yourself.

01:01:11.878 --> 01:01:14.008
Well, it's a shame
we're almost finished.

01:01:14.172 --> 01:01:16.092
We don't have to be.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.620
Oh! David.

01:01:44.786 --> 01:01:46.826
I thought you weren't home
till tomorrow.

01:01:48.748 --> 01:01:50.418
I was.

01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:54.130
And then I thought

01:01:54.295 --> 01:01:57.505
I should be home with my wife
and my son, hmm? Mmm.

01:01:57.673 --> 01:01:59.763
How did you get home
from the station?

01:01:59.926 --> 01:02:02.046
Oh, I got a cab.

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.010
You know, I think
the driver doubles up

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:06.270
as the town's dentist
in his spare time.

01:02:08.142 --> 01:02:10.442
Was it a productive trip?

01:02:10.603 --> 01:02:13.943
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it was.

01:02:15.858 --> 01:02:18.278
Was it productive?

01:02:18.444 --> 01:02:21.494
Yes. It was productive.

01:02:22.782 --> 01:02:25.332
Those paintings are incredible.

01:02:25.493 --> 01:02:28.293
Huh? Don't you think?
I mean, I can't imagine...

01:02:28.454 --> 01:02:30.834
I can't fathom why someone
would wanna cover them up.

01:02:30.998 --> 01:02:32.668
I can.

01:02:38.506 --> 01:02:40.426
Are we taking our...?

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:43.091
No. No, I'm not.

01:02:43.261 --> 01:02:46.011
That's probably
not the best idea.

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:50.020
No, it's probably not.
But they make me feel...

01:02:50.184 --> 01:02:52.604
- Fuzzy.
- Fuzzy.

01:02:57.066 --> 01:03:00.736
I should get back to work.
Lucas will be happy you're home.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.630
<i>Chill that wine, buddy.</i>

01:03:57.793 --> 01:03:59.343
<i>We just crossed
into North Carolina.</i>

01:03:59.504 --> 01:04:01.054
<i>We should be there around five.</i>

01:04:01.214 --> 01:04:02.764
Yeah, great.

01:05:06.237 --> 01:05:07.317
Oh!

01:05:51.699 --> 01:05:52.869
Ah!

01:05:56.537 --> 01:05:59.167
So where exactly is Dana?

01:06:18.476 --> 01:06:20.686
Maybe we should start
cleaning up.

01:06:24.273 --> 01:06:26.073
She's here.

01:06:29.445 --> 01:06:31.525
Jesus H!

01:06:32.573 --> 01:06:34.743
No. Please, sit.

01:06:34.909 --> 01:06:36.449
Sit!

01:06:37.703 --> 01:06:40.213
I'm really sorry I'm late.

01:06:41.374 --> 01:06:43.714
Please forgive me.

01:06:50.883 --> 01:06:53.053
It took me forever to find

01:06:53.219 --> 01:06:55.389
what I was looking for.

01:06:56.806 --> 01:07:00.016
But I guess that's life
in a small town.

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:05.610
A very, very, very small town.

01:07:05.773 --> 01:07:10.323
As far away from civilisation
as David could manage.

01:07:10.486 --> 01:07:12.406
Right, David?

01:07:12.571 --> 01:07:15.661
No big city conveniences for us.

01:07:15.825 --> 01:07:19.945
Just peace and quiet.

01:07:26.377 --> 01:07:29.627
- How were the game hens?
- Um... tasty.

01:07:31.257 --> 01:07:33.177
That's good to hear.

01:07:33.342 --> 01:07:35.802
Because so often when David
tries to take care of something,

01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:38.430
he just fucks it right up.

01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:41.977
- Dana, you're being rude.
- Hey, I was trying to be funny!

01:07:43.728 --> 01:07:47.728
But I forgot -
David is the funny one.

01:07:47.898 --> 01:07:50.858
Which makes me
the not-funny one.

01:07:51.902 --> 01:07:54.992
David's the funny one.
David has a job.

01:07:55.156 --> 01:07:58.986
I am on a leave of absence
from the firm I founded.

01:08:00.202 --> 01:08:05.002
David makes game hens.
I can easily fuck up a waffle.

01:08:06.584 --> 01:08:10.504
David... is a... loving

01:08:10.671 --> 01:08:13.011
and wonderful parent.

01:08:13.174 --> 01:08:15.094
Dana is drunk.

01:08:15.259 --> 01:08:17.429
David is not drunk!

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:23.180
How are you doing, Dana?

01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:26.729
Well, I don't know
how I'm doing, Jules.

01:08:26.895 --> 01:08:28.975
How am I doing, David?

01:08:30.024 --> 01:08:34.783
I think my husband would say
I'm not 100%.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.774
Maybe 98.

01:08:36.947 --> 01:08:40.657
You know,
I have my ups and my downs,

01:08:40.826 --> 01:08:42.866
my good days and my bad.

01:08:43.037 --> 01:08:46.247
But what's great
is I have a purpose.

01:08:46.415 --> 01:08:48.995
Fixing this house
is gonna make it

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:52.127
all better, right, David?

01:08:53.255 --> 01:08:55.005
Look, you know,

01:08:55.174 --> 01:08:56.884
they say that moving
can be very stressful,

01:08:57.051 --> 01:08:58.551
like divorce or a death.

01:08:58.719 --> 01:09:02.099
- Is that what they say?
- I read that somewhere.

01:09:02.264 --> 01:09:04.024
Maybe you could give us
a seminar

01:09:04.183 --> 01:09:06.023
on the five stages of grief

01:09:06.185 --> 01:09:08.305
since you've so obviously read
a fucking pamphlet.

01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:11.069
- Dana!
- Now who's being rude?!

01:09:11.232 --> 01:09:13.232
It's not polite
to interrupt someone

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.399
when they're talking, David.

01:09:18.322 --> 01:09:20.662
In answer
to your question, Jules,

01:09:20.825 --> 01:09:25.535
I would say this move
has been a lot like a death.

01:09:27.665 --> 01:09:29.535
A lot.

01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:35.460
Which reminds me.
Excuse me for one moment.

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.260
Uh, maybe we should go.

01:09:41.428 --> 01:09:43.388
Stay right where you are,
Jules.

01:09:43.555 --> 01:09:45.975
Nobody's going anywhere
before we have dessert.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.691
- David.
- It's fine.

01:09:52.106 --> 01:09:53.975
Oh, my God.

01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:56.189
Don't bother singing
'Happy Birthday'.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.610
She can't hear you.

01:09:59.655 --> 01:10:02.445
Or maybe she can. Who knows?

01:10:03.701 --> 01:10:06.871
Catherine? Are you listening?

01:10:07.037 --> 01:10:09.157
Are you with us, baby?

01:10:09.331 --> 01:10:11.501
Alright, Dana, just stop it!

01:10:11.667 --> 01:10:13.627
Stop what, David?! Spit it out!

01:10:13.794 --> 01:10:16.344
There's no excuse
for this, Dana! No excuse!

01:10:16.505 --> 01:10:20.465
Oh, come on! What's a birthday
party without a birthday cake?

01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:23.760
Isn't that why they're here?

01:10:23.929 --> 01:10:27.979
Isn't that why you asked them
to come all the way here

01:10:28.142 --> 01:10:31.982
on one day out of all possible
days that they could have come?

01:10:32.146 --> 01:10:34.606
So here we are,

01:10:34.773 --> 01:10:40.283
sitting at our table,
eating our food,

01:10:40.446 --> 01:10:44.156
on the exact day
that I gave birth

01:10:44.325 --> 01:10:46.405
to our daughter one year ago.

01:10:46.577 --> 01:10:48.407
Dana, please,
I'm begging you, stop this.

01:10:48.579 --> 01:10:50.499
You asked them

01:10:50.664 --> 01:10:53.134
to celebrate
Catherine's birthday.

01:10:53.292 --> 01:10:55.672
And we're gonna celebrate
Catherine's birthday.

01:10:55.836 --> 01:10:57.796
- No.
- Sit down, David!

01:10:57.963 --> 01:11:00.633
- Let me cut you a slice of cake.
- I said no, Dana. I'm not...

01:11:00.799 --> 01:11:02.839
Just let me cut
the fucking cake!

01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:05.180
- Dana, stop!
- Just let me cut...

01:11:05.346 --> 01:11:07.926
Dana, stop! No!
Dana, give it to me! Stop! No!

01:11:08.098 --> 01:11:12.348
Fine! Fine, take it! Take
that one too! And take that!

01:11:12.519 --> 01:11:15.689
And that! And that! And that!

01:11:15.856 --> 01:11:20.606
And that! And that!
And this! Take it all back!

01:11:20.778 --> 01:11:24.368
Take it all back! Take it!

01:11:32.414 --> 01:11:35.504
I can't do it anymore, David.

01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:40.800
I can't... I can't pretend
to be happy.

01:11:45.803 --> 01:11:48.063
Three months.

01:11:49.848 --> 01:11:53.518
That's... that's 90 days.

01:11:54.895 --> 01:11:56.435
Please.

01:11:57.481 --> 01:12:00.481
I guess that was old enough,
you know?

01:12:03.237 --> 01:12:07.697
Old enough to know
she wanted no part of me.

01:12:09.827 --> 01:12:11.907
No part.

01:12:13.998 --> 01:12:17.208
So she just stopped.

01:12:18.627 --> 01:12:22.167
She just... stopped breathing.

01:12:26.135 --> 01:12:29.295
I can't do it anymore, David.

01:12:31.807 --> 01:12:34.887
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

01:12:48.991 --> 01:12:53.621
Oh, you poor thing,
out here all by yourself.

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:17.062
Dana!

01:13:29.531 --> 01:13:31.081
Lucas?

01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:52.850
Lucas?

01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:04.692
Arggh!

01:15:04.585 --> 01:15:06.375
Shit.

01:15:06.545 --> 01:15:08.335
Dana!

01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:15.759
I will put her
out of her misery.

01:15:15.929 --> 01:15:19.349
We have allowed this curse
to linger too long.

01:15:19.516 --> 01:15:21.766
Don't. Don't, I beg you!

01:15:46.376 --> 01:15:49.496
She will embarrass me no more.

01:16:10.525 --> 01:16:14.195
You are a miserable mother.

01:16:15.239 --> 01:16:18.949
And you will fail again.

01:16:19.993 --> 01:16:21.793
A daughter...

01:16:23.372 --> 01:16:25.082
..and now a dead son.

01:16:25.249 --> 01:16:27.209
NO!

01:16:27.376 --> 01:16:29.206
Amos!

01:16:32.172 --> 01:16:33.722
Arggh!

01:16:50.774 --> 01:16:52.324
Oh!

01:17:14.548 --> 01:17:17.508
Arggh! Arggh!

01:17:24.141 --> 01:17:26.141
Mommy!

01:17:34.985 --> 01:17:36.395
Dana! Dana!

01:17:46.747 --> 01:17:48.997
Dana! Dana!

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:09.440
Dana!

01:18:09.603 --> 01:18:11.863
Dana! Dana!

01:18:12.898 --> 01:18:14.398
Put it down. Put it down!

01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:20.030
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:18:20.197 --> 01:18:22.867
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

01:18:23.033 --> 01:18:25.493
I got you. It's OK.
It's Daddy.

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.500
I got you. I got you.
I got you.

01:18:28.663 --> 01:18:30.583
- Mommy.
- It's OK. It's a bad dream.

01:18:30.749 --> 01:18:33.879
It's OK. It's a bad dream.
It's a bad dream.

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:11.960
Are you out of your fucking
mind? What the fuck?!

01:19:14.042 --> 01:19:16.842
Are you trying to destroy
everything we ever had, Dana?

01:19:17.003 --> 01:19:19.343
- Everything? Are you?!
- Is he OK?

01:19:19.506 --> 01:19:21.836
Yeah, he's fine, Dana. He's
fine. He's asleep in our bed.

01:19:22.008 --> 01:19:24.928
He thinks it was a bad dream.

01:19:27.764 --> 01:19:30.644
David,
I think I can't tell anymore

01:19:30.809 --> 01:19:33.729
what's real and what's not real.

01:19:33.895 --> 01:19:35.855
There was no-one there.

01:19:36.022 --> 01:19:39.862
Nobody was trying to hurt Lucas,
Dana, it was just...

01:19:40.026 --> 01:19:42.316
It was just you.

01:19:49.119 --> 01:19:51.079
I almost killed him.

01:19:55.834 --> 01:19:57.594
I killed Catherine.

01:20:18.023 --> 01:20:19.653
No.

01:20:19.816 --> 01:20:21.986
No, that was an accident.

01:20:22.152 --> 01:20:24.032
That was a horrible accident.

01:20:24.196 --> 01:20:27.406
That's all it was.
And you know that.

01:20:32.829 --> 01:20:33.829
Hey.

01:20:33.997 --> 01:20:36.667
Hey, come here.

01:20:40.879 --> 01:20:41.919
Alright.

01:21:00.398 --> 01:21:02.358
We need to get back home.

01:21:03.401 --> 01:21:04.821
No more running.

01:21:04.986 --> 01:21:06.656
You will get better.

01:21:07.697 --> 01:21:10.487
There's nothing
we can't overcome.
