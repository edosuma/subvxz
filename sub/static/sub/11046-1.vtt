00:39.089 --> 00:41.216
- Santa.
- The big man himself.

00:41.891 --> 00:45.383
Now, Charlie, you're gonna be okay
this year, right?

00:45.562 --> 00:46.654
Never been better, Dad.

00:47.697 --> 00:49.028
Who do we have here?

00:49.532 --> 00:50.760
You're up.

00:54.671 --> 00:57.003
Santa. I can't believe it's really you.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.472
It's all right, everybody.
Happens every year.

01:16.593 --> 01:19.528
- Okay, go. Prove it.
- Okay.

01:26.035 --> 01:30.335
- Santa, my friends and I have a bet.
- About what?

01:31.441 --> 01:33.102
I was right, you're hot!

01:33.276 --> 01:36.370
You guys owe me a soy half-caf
with a mocha shot!

01:36.746 --> 01:38.077
Can you get me a discount?

01:47.524 --> 01:48.923
Mom, I'm 11.

01:49.092 --> 01:51.856
I'll look like a loser
getting my picture with Santa.

01:52.028 --> 01:54.428
You'll look like someone
who's grounded if you don't.

01:54.597 --> 01:56.690
Now go sit on Santa's lap. Go.

02:04.741 --> 02:07.232
Hands off, fat boy!

02:17.086 --> 02:19.247
I don't wanna see Santa!

02:19.422 --> 02:20.821
Then let's just go, okay?

02:20.990 --> 02:23.458
- I don't wanna go!
- Then get on Santa's lap.

02:23.626 --> 02:25.423
I don't wanna!

02:26.729 --> 02:29.129
Somebody's not being a very good girl.

02:29.299 --> 02:32.427
I might have to put coal
in your stocking this year.

02:33.970 --> 02:36.336
Nice work. Did they send you
to school for that?

02:36.506 --> 02:38.667
Okay, look, Katherine.

02:38.842 --> 02:40.901
Nothing's gonna happen. See?

02:42.145 --> 02:43.578
- Everything's okay.
- Oh, my God.

02:43.746 --> 02:47.614
That dorky kid from the AV squad
is getting his picture taken with Santa.

03:05.068 --> 03:07.400
Why do we have to spend Christmas
with Dad, anyway?

03:07.570 --> 03:09.231
He's gonna be working
the whole time.

03:09.405 --> 03:14.399
Honey, I know that this is all hard on you,
but you are the man of the family now.

03:14.577 --> 03:17.444
Your sister is counting on you
to make this a good Christmas.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.014
Honey, please, just take care of her.

03:20.183 --> 03:21.741
Oh, excuse me?

03:21.918 --> 03:26.048
My children are traveling without me
and they told me that I should--

03:26.222 --> 03:29.623
I got two unaccompanied minors!

03:30.159 --> 03:33.128
Welcome to the friendly skies,
underage travelers.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.288
Hey, look what we have here.
The wings. And wings for you.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.060
All right, let's go experience
the wonders of flight.

03:39.235 --> 03:43.194
While we're young. Yes. We have to walk.
There you go.

03:43.373 --> 03:45.136
It's happening.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.868
- I love you, Katie.
- I love you, Mom.

03:48.044 --> 03:49.204
I love you, Spencer.

03:50.446 --> 03:52.346
Please focus.

04:02.592 --> 04:05.652
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>welcome to Hoover International Airport.</i>

04:05.929 --> 04:08.989
- How come we're not in Pennsylvania?
- We have to change planes.

04:09.165 --> 04:11.656
But I liked our plane.

04:14.037 --> 04:16.938
Hey. So you guys
are the Davenports, right?

04:18.007 --> 04:21.875
All right. Well, my name is Zach and I'll
be taking care of you during your layover.

04:22.045 --> 04:23.273
And give me five!

04:24.914 --> 04:27.747
Follow me this way. Man.

04:30.853 --> 04:32.753
Where are all the Christmas decorations?

04:32.922 --> 04:37.325
Well, our boss doesn't really like Christmas
so he locked all the decorations away.

04:37.493 --> 04:42.396
But he did let us put up a few things.
For example, you see that over there?

04:42.565 --> 04:46.729
That green thing is a Christmas tree,
and those red thingies are holly.

04:46.903 --> 04:48.370
It doesn't feel like Christmas.

04:48.538 --> 04:52.304
Yeah, I kind of agree with you.
But that's the way Mr. Porter wanted it.

04:52.475 --> 04:55.273
- Who's Mr. Porter?
- He's the head of Passenger Relations.

04:55.445 --> 04:58.505
And between you and me,
I don't really think he likes passengers...

04:58.681 --> 05:00.273
...or holidays, really.

05:00.450 --> 05:01.712
He sounds mean.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.546
Yeah. It really depends
on what mood he's in.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.349
Smell the air, Hoffman.
Do you know what that is?

05:07.523 --> 05:09.650
Cinnabons, Mr. Porter?

05:09.826 --> 05:13.455
Freedom. It's my first Christmas off
in 15 years.

05:13.629 --> 05:16.257
Just me, a Hawaiian resort...

05:16.432 --> 05:19.424
...and no complaining passengers
to deal with.

05:19.602 --> 05:21.331
You know who will be complaining now?

05:21.504 --> 05:23.404
Me. I'll be complaining about everything.

05:23.573 --> 05:26.337
And they'll just have to stand there
and listen to me...

05:26.509 --> 05:28.909
...because it's their job, not mine.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.740
- Sounds like fun, sir.
- Oh, it's more than fun.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.109
It's my vacation.

05:34.784 --> 05:36.843
Well, aloha, suckers.

05:37.854 --> 05:41.085
<i>Aloha. All flights to Hawaii</i>
<i>have been canceled due to heavy snow.</i>

05:41.257 --> 05:43.623
<i>We apologize for any inconvenience.</i>

05:51.401 --> 05:54.632
And Merry Christmas to me.

05:57.306 --> 06:01.242
- <i>Twenty inches of snow have fallen--</i>
- <i>This is easily the storm of the--</i>

06:01.411 --> 06:03.936
- <i>Worst blizzard we've--</i>
- <i>Ten foot drifts have been--</i>

06:04.113 --> 06:06.673
<i>After Christmas, head</i>
<i>to Hoover International Airport...</i>

06:06.849 --> 06:09.841
<i>...for the first-ever unclaimed</i>
<i>baggage warehouse sale.</i>

06:10.019 --> 06:13.011
<i>You never know what you might find.</i>
<i>Clothes, toys, electronics.</i>

06:13.189 --> 06:15.919
<i>If someone's lost it, you can buy it.</i>
<i>Also don't forget--</i>

06:16.092 --> 06:18.151
Oh, no. Did you bite your tongue again?

06:18.327 --> 06:20.852
When I wrote Santa,
I forgot to tell him...

06:21.030 --> 06:25.490
...that we were gonna be at Dad's house
all the way in Pennsylvania.

06:25.668 --> 06:27.499
How is he gonna find us now?

06:27.670 --> 06:29.934
Oh, you mean that Santa guy
that you're scared of?

06:30.106 --> 06:32.336
Him? I mean, he's not even gonn--

06:35.945 --> 06:38.914
He'll find you. The tooth fairy
gave him directions.

06:39.082 --> 06:40.481
She works with NORAD.

06:41.884 --> 06:45.650
Spencer, NORAD says that Santa's
gonna be at this airport at 4:29.

06:47.657 --> 06:52.026
So that means if we lived here,
Santa would bring me my new doll at 4:30.

06:53.729 --> 06:56.254
Guys. We have a problem.

06:56.432 --> 06:59.799
<i>Attention, passengers. All flights</i>
<i>out of Hoover International Airport...</i>

06:59.969 --> 07:02.961
<i>...have been suspended</i>
<i>due to blizzard conditions.</i>

07:03.139 --> 07:06.506
<i>The weather service is forecasting</i>
<i>extremely heavy snow and high winds...</i>

07:06.676 --> 07:08.644
<i>...until tomorrow morning--</i>

07:10.480 --> 07:13.415
My wife's gonna kill me, man.
I gotta get out of here.

07:13.583 --> 07:15.278
<i>We apologize for any inconvenience.</i>

07:20.523 --> 07:22.013
Where are we going?

07:22.191 --> 07:24.455
Somewhere really fun.

07:26.295 --> 07:27.523
Are we going to prison?

07:27.697 --> 07:31.428
No. We're going to have fun with all
the other kids who are flying by themselves.

07:31.601 --> 07:35.162
Welcome to the
Unaccompanied Minors Room.

07:52.054 --> 07:55.114
Oh, man.
It's like <i>Lord of the Flies</i> in here.

07:55.458 --> 07:57.016
Help us!

07:57.193 --> 08:00.060
Zach, we're flight attendants,
not riot police.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.288
You've got to find someone else
to take over.

08:02.465 --> 08:04.956
You guys, there is no one else.
The storm is huge.

08:05.134 --> 08:08.126
Think of it like being in the air
with a normal passenger load...

08:08.304 --> 08:11.933
...and secure all exits and discourage
anybody from going to the restroom.

08:13.176 --> 08:15.041
- Oh, come on, you guys.
- Have fun, Zach!

08:15.211 --> 08:18.442
Where's your Christmas spirit?
I mean, look at them, they're so cute.

08:19.015 --> 08:21.347
I don't think Santa's
gonna find us in here.

08:34.197 --> 08:38.566
I think I bought defective M&M's.
You know, some of these are W's.

08:38.734 --> 08:41.794
Oh, come on, Val, lighten up, you know?
It's Christm--

08:41.971 --> 08:44.565
I know you're worried about the kids.
They're fine.

08:44.740 --> 08:47.504
It's Christmas Eve.
We're gonna do more decorating--

08:47.677 --> 08:50.840
No. No. Judy, you don't have
any more decorating to do.

08:51.013 --> 08:53.982
I have to finish. I have six more boxes
of lights in the garage.

08:54.150 --> 08:57.210
- This is creepy.
- You're just poisonous, aren't you?

08:57.520 --> 08:59.283
Thanks for being such a great sister.

08:59.455 --> 09:02.151
<i>The Weather Service is calling it</i>
<i>the Storm of the Century.</i>

09:02.325 --> 09:05.556
<i>It's the biggest blizzard to hit</i>
<i>the middle of the country in decades.</i>

09:05.728 --> 09:07.025
<i>We're talking nasty.</i>

09:07.196 --> 09:10.324
<i>It's already grounded all flights</i>
<i>in and out of the Midwest...</i>

09:10.499 --> 09:11.761
Oh, no! The kids!

09:13.135 --> 09:16.070
Can we change planes now?

09:18.407 --> 09:20.238
Okay, yeah, I can do this. All right.

09:20.409 --> 09:23.810
- Kids love me. I'm all right. I'm good.
- Excuse me, sir?

09:23.980 --> 09:26.972
Didn't I tell you this was fun?
Look how many kids are here.

09:27.183 --> 09:28.275
Get us out of here.

09:29.585 --> 09:31.985
Why would you wanna do that?
It's great down here.

09:32.154 --> 09:35.487
Look, watch this. Hey, can I get
you guys' attention, please?

09:35.658 --> 09:36.989
Okay.

09:37.159 --> 09:40.219
All right, accidents happen.
All right, that one was full!

09:40.830 --> 09:42.320
Straw in the eye. Straw in the eye.

09:45.234 --> 09:47.964
Santa's watching!
He's not very happy about this!

09:48.137 --> 09:51.334
- He's not going to come to your house!
- Amateurs.

09:52.375 --> 09:55.708
- I bet he's psycho.
- I heard he tore a kid in half once.

09:55.878 --> 09:59.041
- Go poke him.
- No, you go poke him.

10:12.895 --> 10:14.123
We could call Mom.

10:14.297 --> 10:17.357
Yeah, well, she wouldn't drive
2000 miles to pick us up.

10:17.533 --> 10:18.625
Then let's call Dad.

10:18.801 --> 10:20.860
Yeah, he wouldn't drive
four feet to get us.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.369
Pardon me, do your parents
happen to be divorced?

10:23.539 --> 10:25.439
- What?
- I'm Charlie Goldfinch.

10:25.608 --> 10:28.270
I'm conducting a poll
about flying solo this time of year.

10:28.444 --> 10:30.708
Being divorced is number one.
Being Jewish...

10:30.880 --> 10:32.871
...and visiting your grandparents
is second.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.517
And then there are the rich kids.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.945
But they're not statistically significant.

10:39.155 --> 10:42.454
- Oh, burn.
- Good times, you guys. All right.

10:45.861 --> 10:47.158
Okay.

10:49.799 --> 10:53.997
Her name's Grace Conrad.
I admire your taste.

10:54.170 --> 10:57.833
She's way out of your league,
but if you talk to her, I'll admire your pluck.

10:58.007 --> 11:01.374
So, what about you two?
Divorce or Judaism?

11:01.577 --> 11:04.375
- It's really none of your business.
- Divorced? Me too.

11:04.580 --> 11:08.346
Polls are a great way to learn about
your fellow man. Thank you for your time.

11:09.719 --> 11:11.243
This place is weird.

11:14.490 --> 11:15.752
Could be worse.

11:15.925 --> 11:20.362
Okay, Simon says flush your cellphone.

11:22.798 --> 11:24.425
Is this bathroom out of order?

11:25.668 --> 11:27.226
No.

11:29.171 --> 11:33.198
Must escape the sound of running water.

11:35.544 --> 11:37.637
Read them and weep, boys.

11:39.648 --> 11:42.640
Texas Hold 'Em. Excellent game.

11:42.818 --> 11:44.945
- What, you play?
- Only all the time.

11:45.154 --> 11:46.178
No, you don't.

11:46.355 --> 11:48.880
Yeah, I do. She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

11:49.058 --> 11:52.721
I play all the time and I win.
We think she's adopted.

11:52.895 --> 11:54.294
You're adopted, underpants!

11:54.730 --> 11:57.494
- Underpants.
- Nice jacket. Abercrombie?

11:57.666 --> 12:00.692
Please. It's Dior.
Why? Is yours from A & F?

12:00.870 --> 12:02.770
Our mom bought it for him at Kmart.

12:05.941 --> 12:09.741
Yeah. I gotta take her to get some food.
Her blood sugar's low, right?

12:09.912 --> 12:12.710
No! I wanna watch them play cards,
noodle-head!

12:14.316 --> 12:16.045
Yeah. Let her watch, noodle-head.

12:17.653 --> 12:18.915
See you, Kmart.

12:19.288 --> 12:20.516
Deal me in.

12:22.057 --> 12:26.494
You want your dolly back, you big baby?
You're gonna cry, huh?

12:26.662 --> 12:29.256
Hey, guys, check this out.

12:32.034 --> 12:34.195
It's borderline urgent now, sir.

12:34.370 --> 12:37.965
I cannot let you leave the room. Why
don't you wait for maintenance to fix it?

12:38.140 --> 12:39.869
No, no, no.

12:42.445 --> 12:45.346
Juice box in my back. I am laying
on a juice box.

12:45.514 --> 12:50.008
Sometimes I see my brother kissing
his hand in his bedroom like this.

12:51.554 --> 12:52.885
Awkward.

12:53.055 --> 12:57.458
Did the door just open? I know the door
just opened. I can feel fresh air.

12:57.626 --> 12:59.560
- I know someone's walking out.
- Morons.

12:59.728 --> 13:02.595
- Okay, who farted?
- You can't leave without an attendant.

13:02.765 --> 13:04.596
- Where are you going?
- Out.

13:08.103 --> 13:11.368
This goes against everything
I believe in, but I gotta pee!

13:11.540 --> 13:13.906
Wait, who's going to pee?

13:14.076 --> 13:16.567
Hey, keep the door closed!
Who's walking out?

13:17.179 --> 13:18.237
You better keep that--

13:24.620 --> 13:26.417
Oh, no.

13:26.589 --> 13:28.557
Oh, you worry me, honey.
You worry me.

13:29.124 --> 13:30.113
I gotta call Sam.

13:30.292 --> 13:34.126
Val, please. Why don't you relax?
I know exactly what you need.

13:34.296 --> 13:37.857
A nice steaming cup
of my wonderful hot chocolate.

13:38.033 --> 13:41.525
I've had three already.
And it's 80 degrees outside!

13:41.704 --> 13:43.569
Are you trying to kill me?

13:43.739 --> 13:46.435
Well, no.

13:46.609 --> 13:49.669
Judy, my children are trapped
in an airport on Christmas Eve.

13:49.845 --> 13:52.143
Do you have any idea
how miserable they must be?

13:55.584 --> 13:57.279
Finally.

13:58.187 --> 13:59.984
Where's that kid who had to pee?

14:04.026 --> 14:06.893
- Sam Davenport. Clean Earth Society.
- <i>Hi, Sam, it's Val.</i>

14:07.062 --> 14:09.929
Hey, Val. I'm heading to the airport
now to pick up the kids.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.828
- <i>You're not gonna be able to.</i>
- What?

14:12.001 --> 14:14.629
- <i>They're not gonna be able to fly in!</i>
- Val, calm down.

14:14.803 --> 14:16.794
- <i>There's a blizzard--</i>
- It's not snowing out.

14:16.972 --> 14:18.496
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

14:19.375 --> 14:22.139
- Sure their flight's canceled?
- <i>Would Al Roker make that up?</i>

14:22.311 --> 14:24.472
No, no. I guess Al Roker wouldn't lie.

14:24.647 --> 14:27.878
<i>Val, I'm gonna drive all night to get them.</i>
<i>And don't make that face.</i>

14:33.522 --> 14:37.288
I would like a table for one
in the no-little-sisters section, please.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.791
Aren't you a little young
to be flying by yourself?

14:39.962 --> 14:41.190
Not at all.

14:41.730 --> 14:43.698
No. No kids' menu.

14:44.466 --> 14:47.663
No, no, no. No crayons either.

14:50.573 --> 14:52.666
<i>Welcome to the High Flyer's Club,</i>
<i>Miss Conrad.</i>

14:52.841 --> 14:54.672
Thank you.

14:59.381 --> 15:00.712
Gadgets.

15:05.621 --> 15:07.680
Bingo.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.502
Yes.

15:24.673 --> 15:27.164
Cheese. Condiments.

15:28.777 --> 15:30.369
Caviar.

15:32.414 --> 15:35.178
Nachos. My mom
never lets me eat those.

15:35.384 --> 15:36.578
So an order of those.

15:36.752 --> 15:40.415
She's banned all sodas from the house,
so extra-, extra-, extra-large root beer.

15:40.589 --> 15:42.921
My mom never let me eat
mozzarella sticks.

15:43.125 --> 15:45.423
Mine either. Two orders. On to dessert.

15:45.594 --> 15:47.289
You don't have a tapeworm, do you?

16:04.947 --> 16:06.972
Oh, yeah.

16:55.297 --> 16:58.266
Travel is so exhausting,
don't you think, girls?

16:58.434 --> 17:00.994
Left, left. Yes.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.073
How you doing?

17:11.480 --> 17:13.277
Take it, backup singers!

17:18.153 --> 17:20.519
Sweet Jehoshaphat.

17:20.689 --> 17:21.678
He did it.

17:25.027 --> 17:26.618
Freeze!

17:27.429 --> 17:29.522
Freeze! Hey!

17:29.698 --> 17:31.757
Excuse me, are you unaccompanied?

17:32.034 --> 17:34.229
I'm single. Who's asking?

17:34.870 --> 17:36.895
They are.

17:37.172 --> 17:41.472
Are you gonna let me get dressed,
or should I just walk out of here naked?

17:50.819 --> 17:53.151
Okay, airport food's that much, huh?

17:55.124 --> 17:59.458
- I am so gonna kill you.
- It was good service.

17:59.862 --> 18:02.194
It seemed like he would--

18:04.500 --> 18:06.263
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

18:06.435 --> 18:08.835
He didn't even eat the mozzarella sticks.

18:09.438 --> 18:11.929
- Eat my dust!
- Stop it, kid.

18:12.107 --> 18:13.665
Look out!

18:14.543 --> 18:15.874
Get her!

18:16.044 --> 18:18.308
Coming through!

18:20.616 --> 18:24.916
<i>Security Five, I have an unattended vehicle</i>
<i>outside here.</i>

18:30.492 --> 18:33.461
Hi, officer.

18:33.629 --> 18:35.654
I think you're doing a great job.

18:35.831 --> 18:38.129
- Both of you.
- Hey, kid, hop in!

18:38.300 --> 18:40.666
I don't normally do this, officers. Sorry!

18:52.881 --> 18:55.315
Hey, bro. Hi, Mom, Dad.

18:55.484 --> 18:59.887
You guys, this vacation was awesome.
I just wanna thank you.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.324
- Grace?
- There they are!

19:05.494 --> 19:07.724
- You. Wait for me!
- Stop!

19:08.197 --> 19:11.428
Oh, man, Harvard's never gonna accept me
with a police record.

19:11.600 --> 19:15.263
- And I'm not going to community college.
- Charlie?

19:15.437 --> 19:17.962
What are you guys doing?
That's an official--

19:18.340 --> 19:19.705
- Get them!
- Let's go!

19:20.609 --> 19:23.305
I've always wanted to do this. Go!

19:26.682 --> 19:29.651
Charlie, you might
wanna get on the cart.

19:32.487 --> 19:34.079
Oh, this is a bad idea!

19:37.593 --> 19:39.857
Nicely done.

19:40.028 --> 19:42.189
When did you get here?

19:54.142 --> 19:57.111
I get the feeling we are going
to be in huge trouble.

19:57.312 --> 20:00.440
Not with me behind the wheel. Hang on!

20:06.121 --> 20:07.884
Right turn!

20:15.931 --> 20:17.364
Well, that was fun.

20:22.971 --> 20:24.302
Welcome home.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.464
Where are my friends?

20:26.642 --> 20:29.702
Oh, man. Where's my sister?

20:29.878 --> 20:34.645
They went where all the good little boys
and girls go for Christmas.

20:35.284 --> 20:38.219
They went somewhere nice.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.622
Where, you ask?

20:40.789 --> 20:44.623
Why, the comfortable and festive...

20:44.793 --> 20:47.660
...Hoover International Lodge.

20:47.829 --> 20:53.597
Which is just a few thousand yards
down from this delightful little room.

20:54.102 --> 20:57.868
Which now smells like a horse died in it.

20:58.073 --> 20:59.973
Oh, so we're going to the lodge?

21:02.544 --> 21:05.638
I think I have an answer
to your question.

21:05.814 --> 21:08.783
Are you out of
your juice-drinking little minds?

21:09.918 --> 21:11.715
Have you looked outside lately?

21:11.887 --> 21:15.414
The roads are blocked
because there is a little thing...

21:15.590 --> 21:17.353
...called a blizzard going on.

21:17.526 --> 21:21.860
That's when the sky opens up
and lots of snow falls...

21:22.030 --> 21:24.794
...and makes it hard for people
to do things.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.465
Like fly to Hawaii, for instance.

21:28.937 --> 21:30.564
Who's going to Hawaii?

21:30.739 --> 21:32.570
Not me.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.267
Not anymore.

21:35.444 --> 21:38.743
Sir, I gotta get down to my sister.
She's gonna be freaked without me.

21:38.947 --> 21:40.812
Will she be freaked?

21:40.983 --> 21:44.646
I'm betting she's gonna be stoked
that people are taking care of her...

21:44.820 --> 21:48.347
...and she doesn't have to wait around
for her brother, who abandoned her.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.151
So where are we staying?

21:51.326 --> 21:53.590
What's wrong with right here?

21:53.762 --> 21:55.559
It smells like a horse died in it.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.528
That's exactly the kind of place...

21:57.699 --> 22:01.465
...I thought a bunch of juvenile delinquents
would love to stay.

22:01.636 --> 22:03.263
Watch it, Dr. Evil.

22:03.438 --> 22:05.303
Oh, no, did I offend you?

22:05.474 --> 22:07.772
Well, I don't know what else
to call someone...

22:07.943 --> 22:10.878
...who commits grand theft auto,
reckless driving...

22:11.046 --> 22:14.607
...and destruction of property
all in the course of 10 minutes.

22:14.783 --> 22:17.274
Someone cooler than you'll ever be.

22:19.621 --> 22:21.111
That's fantastic.

22:21.289 --> 22:24.053
I didn't know we had
Ellen DeGeneres in the house.

22:24.860 --> 22:26.794
And what about a young man...

22:26.962 --> 22:29.760
...who orders the heart-attack special
and can't pay for it?

22:30.699 --> 22:35.500
Or a girl who exfoliates herself
all over the airport lounge?

22:36.872 --> 22:40.273
Then, the abominable snowman...

22:40.442 --> 22:42.808
...who transforms
the Emergency Equipment Center...

22:43.011 --> 22:47.380
...into his own private amusement park
and then blames it on Aquaman?

22:47.549 --> 22:50.382
Aren't you a little too old
to be playing with dolls?

22:50.719 --> 22:52.710
I mean, what are you, like 40?

22:53.255 --> 22:55.985
Actually, Beef is 12, sir.

22:56.825 --> 22:58.884
Good Lord.

23:01.530 --> 23:03.862
And Charlie Goldfinch...

23:04.699 --> 23:07.532
...my most frequent underage flyer.

23:08.503 --> 23:10.937
And formerly model passenger.

23:12.174 --> 23:14.369
Karaoke, son?

23:14.876 --> 23:16.605
Was it worth it?

23:17.279 --> 23:19.008
I had a song in my heart.

23:20.749 --> 23:22.876
Oh, my gosh, I'm a juvie.

23:23.919 --> 23:28.015
I think you can all see that I have
a very compelling case...

23:28.190 --> 23:33.924
...to keep you here in the U.M.
on Christmas Eve.

23:34.329 --> 23:38.197
But who's gonna take care of them?

23:39.968 --> 23:41.697
You are, Van Bourke.

23:41.870 --> 23:44.566
And unless you enjoy unemployment...

23:44.739 --> 23:49.108
...you'll make sure they don't
get out of this room again.

24:00.722 --> 24:03.020
The phone lines at the airport
are still down.

24:03.191 --> 24:06.160
Just call Spencer's cellphone.
Why don't you do that?

24:06.328 --> 24:08.922
Sam talked me out of getting him one.

24:09.097 --> 24:13.033
He said millions of them
were polluting landfills already.

24:13.201 --> 24:15.499
He's never gonna make it
from Pennsylvania.

24:15.670 --> 24:18.264
There's just no way.
He doesn't even have a real car!

24:19.141 --> 24:21.200
You married a guy with a vegetable car.

24:22.811 --> 24:27.976
This is good. This is good!
Me and you on the roads. Two guys.

24:28.150 --> 24:32.018
I don't imagine there are gonna be many
biodiesel depots open on Christmas Eve...

24:32.187 --> 24:37.557
...so I've packed you a little holiday meal.
I hope you like vegetarian.

24:39.928 --> 24:43.159
I hope you like vegetarian.

24:45.901 --> 24:49.803
Katherine can't have Christmas morning
without Santa Claus.

24:51.373 --> 24:52.397
Let's go.

24:59.614 --> 25:01.013
Road trip!

25:11.259 --> 25:15.355
I got the last rooms. We'll have to pack
the sky brats in like sardines.

25:15.530 --> 25:18.590
I wanna go home. I don't wanna
get packed in like a sardine.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.667
Santa's never gonna find me here.

25:22.137 --> 25:24.697
I didn't understand a word of that.

25:25.407 --> 25:27.807
So, little girl...

25:27.976 --> 25:31.139
...how would you like to stay
with Mary Lynn and me?

25:31.646 --> 25:33.136
Who's Mary Lynn?

25:33.848 --> 25:37.545
Only the world's sweetest
sweetie pie, that's who.

25:39.955 --> 25:45.154
Hi. I'm Mary Lynn. We're gonna
have loads of fun together.

25:47.996 --> 25:50.430
Okay. You listen, and you listen good.

25:50.599 --> 25:53.966
I've never had a little sister,
so you're gonna be my test run.

25:54.135 --> 25:56.603
I am going to braid your hair, little girl.

25:56.771 --> 26:00.172
And even if you try to say no,
you'll face the consequences.

26:00.342 --> 26:02.833
Get it? Got it? Good!

26:05.847 --> 26:08.907
So there is some good news.

26:10.452 --> 26:12.682
Your cots are ready.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.916
Yeah, I'll be right back.

26:22.631 --> 26:25.191
This is so not the Christmas
I had in mind.

26:25.367 --> 26:27.164
Oh, poor baby.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.963
I bet you have nice Christmases,
don't you, rich kid?

26:30.305 --> 26:34.799
Where does your family go?
Paris? London? Fiji?

26:34.976 --> 26:38.912
Please. Fiji's a zoo this time of year.
We go skiing in Utah.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.570
Are your folks still together?

26:41.283 --> 26:42.477
Yeah.

26:42.651 --> 26:45.313
- Then I hate you.
- I'm not wild about you either.

26:45.487 --> 26:49.947
Well, I love Christmas.
And I'm Jewish.

26:50.725 --> 26:52.022
My mom's boyfriend says...

26:52.193 --> 26:56.027
...that Christmas is when
Frosty the Snowman fights with the devil.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.397
It talks.

27:01.303 --> 27:03.794
- I'm getting out of here.
- What are you talking about?

27:03.972 --> 27:06.532
I need to get to my sister
down at the hotel.

27:06.708 --> 27:09.370
She's expecting Santa's sleigh
to get there at 4:30 a.m...

27:09.544 --> 27:13.071
...and if I don't get down there,
she's gonna think Santa forgot her.

27:13.248 --> 27:15.580
And I can't let that happen.
So who's with me?

27:16.751 --> 27:18.446
How would you get us out of here?

27:20.555 --> 27:21.749
I got an idea.

27:25.393 --> 27:29.090
- This is not gonna work.
- This is so junior high.

27:29.264 --> 27:31.095
I know. It's cool, isn't it?

27:31.266 --> 27:34.793
<i>Attention, Zach Van Bourke.</i>
<i>Please report to the Information Desk.</i>

27:34.969 --> 27:37.961
<i>You're wanted at the Information Desk.</i>

27:43.812 --> 27:47.179
All right, guys. Well, I'll be right back.

27:47.349 --> 27:50.807
You guys stay. Please.

28:06.434 --> 28:08.800
Great plan, Kmart.
Really thought that one out.

28:09.304 --> 28:10.965
That was only part of the plan.

28:17.011 --> 28:18.603
Hey.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.214
Hey.

28:21.416 --> 28:22.849
I'm here.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.613
Yeah.

28:29.624 --> 28:33.958
You know what?
It's been really cool hanging out.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.790
But I'm gonna go back to the book.

28:36.398 --> 28:38.298
I'm Zach Van Bourke. You paged me?

28:39.634 --> 28:42.364
Yeah. You got a phone message
from some kids.

28:42.537 --> 28:46.530
- I do?
- Yeah. They said:

28:50.478 --> 28:52.241
"Goodbye."

28:55.950 --> 28:59.317
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no!

29:08.496 --> 29:11.693
You're right.
That was so junior high.

29:12.167 --> 29:15.295
Operation Save Christmas is a go.

29:17.405 --> 29:20.465
Looking good, baby, looking good!

29:20.642 --> 29:24.078
Who needs four-wheel drive
when you've got the power of clean?

29:26.381 --> 29:29.475
Hey! Get out of the way, grandma!

29:31.886 --> 29:34.184
Fossil-fuel junkie.

29:34.355 --> 29:36.050
Gasoholic.

29:36.224 --> 29:38.385
Enjoy the hangover!

29:47.135 --> 29:49.000
I wonder where the fire is.

29:56.978 --> 30:00.072
Doesn't she look just darling?

30:00.482 --> 30:01.710
Excuse me, lady.

30:02.350 --> 30:05.911
I need to be at-- I need to get it--

30:06.120 --> 30:09.920
I need to be at a chimney at 4:30
because I need to meet Santa.

30:10.358 --> 30:15.022
Girls? The pilots are down in the restaurant,
and they wanna buy us dinner.

30:15.196 --> 30:19.292
Captain Cohen's down there.
Never too late for a fifth husband.

30:19.467 --> 30:20.593
Let's go, girls!

30:21.603 --> 30:23.230
The kids.

30:24.239 --> 30:29.370
Don't worry, ma'am, I'm a certified
babysitter. I get paid 50 cents an hour.

30:29.811 --> 30:33.611
Mary Lynn, there's a 20 in this for you.

30:34.849 --> 30:37.511
Captain Cohen, here I come.

30:38.586 --> 30:40.884
Oh, no, you don't.

30:41.055 --> 30:43.353
You are not going anywhere...

30:43.525 --> 30:48.053
...because I am going to give you
a makeover.

30:48.229 --> 30:51.198
An extreme makeover.

30:54.035 --> 30:55.400
They're children.

30:55.570 --> 30:58.471
Don't tell me you can't find them.
They're little tiny people.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.267
Get back.

31:00.975 --> 31:03.205
Do you know what the word
"security" means?

31:03.378 --> 31:05.243
From the Latin, <i>securitas</i> ?

31:05.413 --> 31:08.678
As in "secure the building
from children running amuck."

31:08.850 --> 31:10.340
Mr. Porter...

31:10.952 --> 31:13.512
...as long as the kids are in the airport,
they're safe.

31:13.688 --> 31:16.680
If you chase them,
it's just gonna make things worse.

31:16.858 --> 31:18.758
Oh, yeah. That's right, Van Bourke.

31:18.927 --> 31:22.419
That would be much more tragic
than me getting fired.

31:22.597 --> 31:24.622
Now, you help me find those kids...

31:24.799 --> 31:27.199
...or I'm gonna lock you
in the U.M. Room all night.

31:27.368 --> 31:28.733
How do you like them apples?

31:28.903 --> 31:30.495
Oh, my gosh, we're fugitives.

31:30.672 --> 31:32.105
Shut up.

31:35.677 --> 31:37.440
What, they call the National Guard?

31:37.612 --> 31:40.046
If you get me sent back to that room,
you're dead.

31:40.214 --> 31:43.183
What are you gonna do, rich girl?
Have your daddy hire a hit man?

31:43.351 --> 31:46.218
Maybe I'll just have him
break your dad out of jail.

31:49.524 --> 31:52.960
Girl fight. Girl fight.
Oh, my gosh, it's a girl fight.

31:53.127 --> 31:56.324
No, no, no. Don't, don't, don't.
Please, no, no, no.

31:58.466 --> 32:01.731
I saw this on cable once
but then my dad blocked the channel.

32:04.105 --> 32:05.970
'Tis the season to be j--

32:06.140 --> 32:07.835
That's gonna hurt when I pee.

32:09.978 --> 32:12.208
Oh, my gosh. Kid, are you okay?

32:12.847 --> 32:14.576
I'm fine.

32:15.016 --> 32:18.611
Look, I'm really sorry.
I just don't like being touched, okay?

32:19.053 --> 32:21.453
Got it. Won't happen again.

32:21.623 --> 32:22.647
You know what, guys?

32:22.824 --> 32:26.817
If we are ever gonna get down
to that hotel, we have to be a team.

32:26.995 --> 32:30.260
You know, we have to think like a team.

32:30.431 --> 32:32.763
We have to act like a team,
talk like a team.

32:32.934 --> 32:36.301
We have to walk like a team,
fight like a team and be like a team...

32:36.471 --> 32:39.599
...because we are the U.M. Team.

32:49.017 --> 32:50.279
Yeah. What do we do first?

32:53.721 --> 32:56.451
I'll get your sister a Christmas tree.

33:04.899 --> 33:06.890
We're never gonna see him again,
are we?

33:07.168 --> 33:10.399
- Probably not.
- Okay, if I may interject.

33:10.605 --> 33:12.470
If we wanna get out of this airport...

33:12.640 --> 33:16.235
...our best bet would be the lower level,
northeast corner...

33:16.411 --> 33:19.778
...behind the baggage claim.
Security's thin at this time of night.

33:19.947 --> 33:21.346
And how do you know that?

33:21.916 --> 33:24.976
I fly out of Hoover International
every week.

33:34.095 --> 33:38.498
There.
Now it's time to brush your teeth.

33:38.666 --> 33:40.827
- I'm not a doll, Mary Lynn.
- No.

33:41.002 --> 33:43.266
You're way better. You can talk.

33:43.438 --> 33:46.430
And I don't even
have to pull a stupid string.

33:48.476 --> 33:49.841
Now open up.

33:50.044 --> 33:52.171
But, Mary Lynn,
I already brushed my teeth.

33:53.681 --> 33:55.808
Did you tell the kids
I was coming to get them?

33:55.983 --> 33:57.814
- <i>No.</i>
- Why not?

33:57.985 --> 34:01.011
Because Spencer doesn't
have a cellphone, remember?

34:01.189 --> 34:03.350
I didn't want the kids
getting their hopes up...

34:03.524 --> 34:05.458
...in case your car
doesn't make it there.

34:05.660 --> 34:07.560
Hey, the biomobile rocks, okay?

34:07.729 --> 34:09.525
I have enough fuel in the back seat...

34:09.697 --> 34:11.891
...to get me to Florida and back
if I wanted to.

34:12.065 --> 34:15.467
<i>Well, I hope you're not talking</i>
<i>on one of those roadside pay phones.</i>

34:15.937 --> 34:19.600
I read that all kinds of freak accidents
happen there by the shoulder.

34:19.774 --> 34:21.435
Wait, wait. Honey.

34:21.609 --> 34:24.373
You have to stop reading
those dumb tabloids, okay?

34:24.545 --> 34:27.241
You know they make those stories up.

34:41.929 --> 34:43.556
Oh, boy.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.165
<i>Zooey, you gotta toughen this kid up.</i>

34:48.335 --> 34:51.271
<i>Oh, Ernie. Beef's only 12.</i>

34:51.438 --> 34:54.601
Twelve. Exactly.
He still plays with a doll.

34:54.775 --> 34:58.872
Have you seen the kids that pick on him?
He should be eating them for breakfast.

34:59.213 --> 35:01.238
It's your ex-husband's fault.

35:01.749 --> 35:05.515
Ninny. If it was up to me, I'd drop this kid
in the middle of the woods...

35:05.686 --> 35:08.018
...give him a knife
and a book of matches.

35:08.189 --> 35:11.022
Let him find his way home,
the way my old man did it to me.

35:11.225 --> 35:14.058
Men are made, not born.

35:14.228 --> 35:15.718
Merry Christmas.

35:18.099 --> 35:20.590
Take me with you, Santa.

35:23.237 --> 35:27.571
Aquaman, men are made, not born.

35:35.249 --> 35:38.116
- My deal.
- Mr. Yakamora.

35:38.319 --> 35:40.913
Hey, it's a dog. Are you hungry?

35:41.088 --> 35:44.615
Okay. So the exit we're looking for
is right behind that door.

35:44.792 --> 35:47.124
We need a distraction
to get them away from there.

35:47.295 --> 35:50.321
No Christmas dinner for you, Cujo.

35:52.633 --> 35:54.931
- Yeah, keep barking, right.
- I think we just found it.

36:00.942 --> 36:03.206
Okay, kids.

36:03.377 --> 36:06.073
Let's follow your crumbs.

36:07.582 --> 36:11.074
- It's almost gone.
- Forget the dog. Come on, keep dealing.

36:11.252 --> 36:13.083
We only got a half-hour for lunch.

36:18.693 --> 36:21.491
So this guy gives me his bag.
It was so heavy...

36:30.605 --> 36:32.869
Hey, man. Why don't you share
your lunch with him?

36:33.040 --> 36:36.476
Okay, doggie.
You can have the last piece.

36:36.644 --> 36:38.111
Not.

36:41.315 --> 36:43.146
Not gonna get it.

37:03.004 --> 37:04.369
Oh, man.

37:09.143 --> 37:11.134
- Van Bourke, get after that dog.
- What?

37:11.312 --> 37:12.643
- The dog.
- Okay.

37:12.813 --> 37:14.246
That's him, guys. Hide.

37:14.415 --> 37:17.077
- What the hell is going on here?
- The dog got out.

37:17.251 --> 37:18.809
- How?
- We don't know.

37:22.056 --> 37:24.524
Trapped like rats.

37:37.204 --> 37:38.762
<i>No. Zip.</i>

37:38.940 --> 37:41.170
Hello?

37:42.944 --> 37:44.969
Anybody in here?

37:45.446 --> 37:47.311
Oh, candy.

37:47.481 --> 37:50.746
Anybody under 6 feet tall?

37:51.352 --> 37:55.288
Anybody who isn't
traveling with an adult?

37:59.527 --> 38:03.361
Olly olly oxen free?

38:06.767 --> 38:10.635
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

38:11.372 --> 38:13.169
Hello?

38:19.480 --> 38:21.277
Sir? Hi.

38:21.449 --> 38:23.781
Yeah, that dog just took a dump
in the promenade...

38:23.951 --> 38:26.943
- ...and its owner wants to talk to you.
- The nightmare has begun.

38:27.355 --> 38:29.550
Search this room from top to bottom...

38:29.724 --> 38:33.387
...and let me know the minute you find
anybody. Van Bourke, come with me.

38:34.395 --> 38:36.192
Mr. Porter.

38:38.599 --> 38:41.830
- What is this doing here?
- Unclaimed.

38:42.003 --> 38:43.595
Well, get it back to the warehouse.

38:44.638 --> 38:46.902
Do I have to do everything around here?

38:55.716 --> 38:57.081
My candy.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.319
Oh, gosh.

39:01.122 --> 39:02.953
- Let's go get some coffee.
- Let's go.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.662
- What's the matter?
- Charlie is in there.

39:09.830 --> 39:12.355
- What?
- Turn it off.

39:12.933 --> 39:15.401
There's no key. Charlie!

39:16.504 --> 39:18.131
Why, hello.

39:18.739 --> 39:20.969
- Donna, what are you doing?
- Come back!

39:21.142 --> 39:22.473
I gotta save him!

39:22.676 --> 39:26.669
It's not so bad in here. Oh, no!

39:26.847 --> 39:28.337
Charli--

39:32.386 --> 39:34.752
- Help!
- Donna!

39:34.955 --> 39:36.684
I hope this is going someplace nice.

39:38.559 --> 39:39.890
Charlie!

39:41.729 --> 39:43.424
You follow her, okay? I'll take him.

39:43.597 --> 39:44.928
- Got it.
- Good.

39:53.207 --> 39:55.505
I should have gone to the bathroom.

39:55.676 --> 39:56.973
Help me!

39:58.579 --> 40:00.570
You've gotta be kidding me.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.525
Well, that doesn't sound good.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.268
Oh, that's gotta hurt.

40:27.441 --> 40:28.703
That hurt.

40:31.512 --> 40:35.004
- Charlie.
- Donna, is that you?

40:35.182 --> 40:36.979
Charlie, are you--?

40:46.627 --> 40:48.424
- Go.
- Okay.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.598
I got you, Charlie.

41:03.210 --> 41:04.871
Charlie, are you okay?

41:05.045 --> 41:08.276
I'd be better if you'd
get your knee off my spleen.

41:10.050 --> 41:12.985
- Oh, no.
- Hang on, Charlie!

41:16.657 --> 41:17.681
Donna, Charlie.

41:17.858 --> 41:20.122
Are you guys okay?
Please tell me you're okay.

41:20.294 --> 41:23.752
Donna? Your knee's
in an even worse place this time.

41:23.931 --> 41:26.161
Oh, thanks.

41:26.333 --> 41:29.632
You guys, look.

41:30.671 --> 41:32.002
Where are we?

41:32.173 --> 41:34.471
This would be
the unclaimed-baggage warehouse.

41:34.642 --> 41:35.973
I saw this place on TV.

41:36.143 --> 41:39.977
Oh, my gosh. There's at least 50 years'
worth of unclaimed luggage in this place.

41:40.147 --> 41:42.138
Please, someone, tell me it's beautiful.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.843
Hey, Spencer. Looks like your sister's...

41:45.019 --> 41:48.750
...not the only one who's gonna
get a good Christmas this year.

41:48.923 --> 41:53.383
- Somebody wanna unzip me?
- Sure. Sorry.

42:08.842 --> 42:10.309
Cool.

43:12.339 --> 43:14.068
Oh, boy.

43:39.533 --> 43:42.093
No! Please don't kill me.

43:42.269 --> 43:46.365
That was a friendly honk, meant
only to respectfully attract attention.

43:47.675 --> 43:51.406
Oh, hey. Sorry to scare you.
I was just about to carve a beaver.

43:52.813 --> 43:55.441
Carve a beaver. Got it. Got it.

43:56.884 --> 44:00.411
Hey, do you guys sell biodiesel here?

44:00.587 --> 44:04.921
We got regular diesel and unleaded gas.
That's about it.

44:05.092 --> 44:08.425
Unless you want a statue of Lincoln
carved out of a telephone pole.

44:10.631 --> 44:13.464
What harm could one tank of diesel do?

44:19.340 --> 44:20.739
What have I done?

44:31.018 --> 44:33.179
Oh, thank God.

44:46.433 --> 44:47.661
That doesn't look good.

45:14.695 --> 45:16.424
So, what's the cool things you found?

45:17.531 --> 45:18.759
Say hello to my surfboard.

45:18.966 --> 45:21.332
I found a walkie-talkie family pack.

45:21.502 --> 45:23.663
It has cameras and video screens
inside of them.

45:23.837 --> 45:28.467
Oh, I just took a video of the inside
of my ear using a penlight and a macro lens.

45:28.642 --> 45:31.668
Now, who wants to see my ear canal?
Come on.

45:33.347 --> 45:34.507
No, thank you.

45:35.115 --> 45:36.548
I'll watch it, then.

45:38.619 --> 45:41.884
Spencer? Anything you wanna tell us?

45:42.055 --> 45:45.491
Oh, this. It's for my sister.
She loves princesses.

45:45.692 --> 45:48.684
Then why don't you give her
the rich girl over there?

45:50.898 --> 45:52.525
Kidding.

45:53.200 --> 45:54.690
What'd you find?

45:54.868 --> 45:57.769
You know, I have no idea,
but how cool does it look?

45:57.938 --> 46:00.065
Hey, that's an 8-track tape player.

46:00.441 --> 46:03.376
According to the <i>Massachusetts</i>
<i>8-Track Collector Magazine</i>...

46:03.544 --> 46:06.638
...I have the largest collection
of cassettes in the state.

46:06.814 --> 46:08.941
But I don't mean to brag.

46:10.417 --> 46:12.282
This is one of my favorites.

46:12.453 --> 46:14.182
Could this night get any better?

46:25.799 --> 46:27.391
What is he doing?

46:45.586 --> 46:47.554
What are you doing?

47:23.190 --> 47:25.818
- Hoffman.
- Shut up.

47:26.360 --> 47:28.157
Hoffman.

47:28.328 --> 47:30.796
Not now.

47:31.298 --> 47:33.892
Hoffman, I think you should
take a look at this.

47:35.402 --> 47:36.767
This better be good.

47:37.871 --> 47:40.601
What in the sam hill?

47:51.084 --> 47:53.348
Oh, Charles.

47:55.222 --> 47:57.247
Hey.

47:57.891 --> 48:00.359
Yeah, Charles.

48:01.895 --> 48:03.419
Hey, hey, hey.

48:03.597 --> 48:06.691
Look, I saved him, I'll dance with him.

48:07.801 --> 48:09.393
Okay.

48:10.070 --> 48:11.537
Hey, you let me touch you.

48:11.738 --> 48:16.300
I'm touching you, kid. Don't get any ideas.
I can still take you down.

48:17.477 --> 48:20.071
All right, Kmart, let's see what you got.

48:20.247 --> 48:21.805
Okay.

48:27.054 --> 48:29.716
You realize if you tell anyone
about that photo you saw...

48:29.890 --> 48:32.085
- ...I'll have to kill you.
- Right. Lips sealed.

48:32.259 --> 48:34.056
Not telling anyone, I swear.

48:34.728 --> 48:36.286
Good.

48:37.297 --> 48:40.755
- It was a nice picture, though. I liked it.
- Nice try.

48:40.934 --> 48:44.529
No, I mean, I think girls
look really good in glasses.

48:44.705 --> 48:47.265
Not that you don't
look good without them, of course.

48:47.441 --> 48:49.773
I mean, that's not what I meant at all,
you know?

48:49.943 --> 48:52.605
- I was a dork.
- Hey, join the club.

48:54.414 --> 48:56.609
You're not a dork. You just...

48:56.783 --> 48:59.980
You just need someone doing
better PR for you than your sister.

49:01.722 --> 49:04.919
Are you gonna pass out or something?

49:06.393 --> 49:09.294
Oh, man. I mean, we gotta go.

49:12.599 --> 49:16.262
You know what, guys? We gotta go.
My sister's expecting Santa's sleigh soon.

49:16.436 --> 49:18.597
We don't know
how we're getting to the hotel.

49:18.772 --> 49:22.708
Why do you need a hotel when you've got
a nice concrete room to go back to?

49:24.177 --> 49:26.202
- Run!
- They're on the move, boys.

49:26.380 --> 49:30.043
Don't lose them in here.
Van Bourke, guard the door.

49:30.217 --> 49:32.777
But it's Christmas Eve, sir.
Can you just...

49:32.953 --> 49:34.580
...leave them alone?

49:41.261 --> 49:42.728
Split up, split up!

49:46.533 --> 49:48.967
We might wanna
get off the main road here.

49:49.536 --> 49:52.869
- Grace, come on.
- Dirty. Okay.

50:03.250 --> 50:06.777
Okay, nobody panic.
Nobody panic. Nobody panic!

50:06.987 --> 50:08.614
Donna, I have a confession.

50:08.789 --> 50:11.553
I was never a good runner.
I can't even do the running man.

50:11.725 --> 50:15.661
You smart guys are all the same:
Good on test day, bad on fight day.

50:15.829 --> 50:18.024
Follow me, men.

50:18.532 --> 50:23.469
Watch out for your footing, guys.
I don't want anyone falling behind.

50:25.772 --> 50:27.535
There's the door.

50:28.508 --> 50:29.941
You guys, look, it's the hotel.

50:30.677 --> 50:31.974
Oh, boy.

50:32.145 --> 50:35.410
Move it, moron.
They're escaping out the back.

50:36.049 --> 50:39.143
- It's the Hoover International Lodge.
- We need to get down there.

50:39.352 --> 50:42.788
How? You got four snowmobiles?

50:46.460 --> 50:47.984
Watch the Winter Olympics?

50:50.330 --> 50:51.820
Wait, wait, wait.

50:51.998 --> 50:53.659
Wait.

50:54.301 --> 50:55.859
What are you doing?

50:56.036 --> 50:58.129
We're going to the hotel
to find Spencer's sister.

50:58.305 --> 51:00.432
Way to go. Anything else
you wanna tell him?

51:00.607 --> 51:03.041
Van Dork, I'm afraid you know
too much now.

51:03.210 --> 51:04.734
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Okay, now go!

51:04.911 --> 51:07.072
Wait, I promise I won't talk.
Please let me out!

51:07.247 --> 51:08.544
Hey! Hey!

51:11.718 --> 51:16.155
Last one down the hill is a fired apple.

51:34.941 --> 51:37.171
We seem to be moving a tad rapidly.

51:46.987 --> 51:48.511
Tree! Watch out!

51:56.329 --> 51:59.821
- Pine needles!
- Nice steering, Tex.

52:01.601 --> 52:05.560
I usually like to try to avoid clichés,
but we've got some company.

52:13.113 --> 52:15.445
More trees!

52:16.983 --> 52:20.475
Take evasive action, boys!
Steer around the trees.

52:20.821 --> 52:22.789
How do we steer?

52:32.732 --> 52:36.395
You know, if I wasn't so utterly terrified,
I might be having fun.

52:36.770 --> 52:38.203
Drift!

52:49.983 --> 52:52.008
My butt!

52:52.185 --> 52:54.619
Cowabunga!

52:58.091 --> 52:59.786
Sweet Jehoshaphat!

53:06.399 --> 53:07.798
Look out, he's gonna hit us!

53:07.968 --> 53:09.936
Lean left!

53:16.142 --> 53:18.576
I'm coming, Mr. Porter!

53:18.745 --> 53:20.645
This is all wonderful fun...

53:20.814 --> 53:23.339
...but you do realize the enormous
amount of trouble...

53:23.516 --> 53:25.609
...you're gonna be in
when I catch you, right?

53:25.785 --> 53:27.275
Not if I can help it. Paddle!

53:31.057 --> 53:32.786
Oh, you wanna speed up, huh?

53:32.959 --> 53:34.426
Okay!

53:35.695 --> 53:37.458
Wait for me!

53:42.669 --> 53:44.102
Not to be a stick in the mud...

53:44.271 --> 53:46.831
...but we're moving
at a very dangerous rate of speed.

53:47.007 --> 53:50.272
- I'd like to second that interjection!
- Keep paddling until I say when!

53:50.443 --> 53:52.934
Please tell me you're gonna stop
at the hotel!

53:53.113 --> 53:56.014
Yeah, we are, but you're not!
Hit the brakes!

53:56.182 --> 53:58.446
Hit the brakes!
Hit the brakes!

54:01.721 --> 54:02.983
Unbelievable.

54:05.091 --> 54:07.719
I don't get paid enough for this!

54:07.894 --> 54:10.863
Holy cow!

54:13.466 --> 54:15.661
Well, this should be interesting.

54:18.738 --> 54:20.672
Darn.

54:23.209 --> 54:25.541
Van Dork, aren't you coming with us?

54:25.712 --> 54:27.907
No, you guys do what you gotta do.

54:28.081 --> 54:30.879
I'm just gonna sit here and you know...

54:31.518 --> 54:33.179
...throw up for a little bit.

54:33.653 --> 54:35.382
- Go.
- Spencer.

54:35.555 --> 54:38.422
- Yeah?
- Be careful, okay?

54:38.792 --> 54:40.987
You guys are acting like
you had too much sugar.

54:41.161 --> 54:43.721
Don't worry, Van Bourke. We're okay.

54:43.897 --> 54:45.524
Wait up, you guys.

54:53.571 --> 54:55.300
Guard cat.

55:27.171 --> 55:29.469
You were a worthy opponent.

55:44.055 --> 55:46.182
Ain't it a little past your bedtime, sonny?

55:46.357 --> 55:48.188
I want a Christmas tree.

55:48.959 --> 55:50.859
What about that little one?

55:54.732 --> 55:56.962
What do I look like,
freaking Charlie Brown?

55:57.468 --> 55:59.629
This big one's expensive.
You got any money?

56:10.948 --> 56:14.406
- Sunday potluck, don't forget!
- All right, partner, see you there!

56:14.585 --> 56:16.348
You wanna come in for some eggnog?

56:16.821 --> 56:18.413
Oh, man.

56:18.589 --> 56:20.887
How am I gonna get to my kids now?

56:22.093 --> 56:23.321
Your kids?

56:23.494 --> 56:27.453
No, sir. No kid should be alone
on Christmas Eve. Not in an airport.

56:27.631 --> 56:31.533
I really appreciate it.
However I can repay you, just name it.

56:33.437 --> 56:34.665
Oh, no.

56:34.839 --> 56:37.808
The mayor dropped it off for an oil change,
but he's out of town.

56:37.975 --> 56:40.967
You use it to pick up your kids
and head back here.

56:41.145 --> 56:43.010
I'll get you a rental car
in the morning.

56:43.180 --> 56:45.512
I can't drive that thing.
It gets terrible mileage.

56:45.683 --> 56:48.652
I'd loan you my Caddy, but squirrels
ate through the brake lines.

56:48.819 --> 56:50.753
I'm afraid this is your only choice.

56:51.856 --> 56:54.723
Depends how much you wanna
see your kids.

56:57.061 --> 56:58.858
Forgive me, brother squirrel.

57:04.168 --> 57:05.567
Oh, man.

57:06.203 --> 57:10.105
I hope the boys in the Sierra Club
don't see me in this.

57:10.374 --> 57:11.739
Thanks.

57:11.909 --> 57:17.211
Okay, so my sister is in room 424.
We've got like 14 minutes and-- Thirteen.

57:20.784 --> 57:24.515
Okay. Now I'm mad.

57:24.889 --> 57:26.550
Elevator.

57:27.958 --> 57:31.155
- What are you doing? Get in.
- We'll take care of him. Get your sister.

57:31.328 --> 57:33.489
Here, take these walkies.
You'll need them.

57:33.664 --> 57:38.863
Don't you kids know that you're supposed
to be good on Christmas Eve?

57:39.036 --> 57:42.472
Physician, heal thyself!

57:42.640 --> 57:43.868
It's Shakespeare.

57:44.041 --> 57:46.771
Man, you're no end of help
in a fight, are you?

57:46.944 --> 57:52.644
Oh, well. Maybe next Christmas
will be better than this one.

57:52.816 --> 57:56.718
Sir, I advise you not to do that.

57:57.555 --> 58:00.422
Punk, watch this.

58:03.260 --> 58:05.490
Thanks for the tip.

58:06.330 --> 58:10.699
Oh, perfect. Now everything hurts.

58:11.602 --> 58:14.230
My contacts are going crazy.

58:18.342 --> 58:20.242
Once a dork...

58:21.278 --> 58:22.768
...always a dork.

58:23.614 --> 58:25.104
You are so not a dork.

58:29.687 --> 58:31.780
Kid!

58:32.523 --> 58:35.356
- Hey, kid!
- Santa's sleigh arrives in nine minutes.

58:35.526 --> 58:38.689
- We gotta find her.
- It's time to pluck your eyebrows.

58:38.862 --> 58:42.025
- Is my sister Katherine in there?
- Who wants to know?

58:42.199 --> 58:43.496
Her brother wants to know.

58:43.667 --> 58:46.761
Well, I'm not allowed
to talk to strangers.

58:49.139 --> 58:51.004
Let me handle this.

58:53.210 --> 58:55.542
Move!

58:59.250 --> 59:00.512
Oh, no.

59:02.620 --> 59:04.178
Room service! Room service!

59:04.355 --> 59:06.653
Hey! No! Stop that!

59:06.824 --> 59:11.488
Stop. Stop that.
You're gonna get me in trouble!

59:13.464 --> 59:15.796
There were some kids running wild
in the hall...

59:15.966 --> 59:18.901
...and I was just trying to stop them.

59:19.069 --> 59:20.832
It wasn't me.

59:21.805 --> 59:23.432
It sounded like you.

59:23.607 --> 59:27.304
They're very talented children.

59:27.478 --> 59:33.007
I'm just gonna go find the children.

59:33.751 --> 59:35.241
Right now!

59:35.419 --> 59:38.547
- Charlie, where are you guys?
- Engaged with the enemy at the moment.

59:38.722 --> 59:41.782
- Taking evasive action.
- <i>We think Spencer's sister is downstairs.</i>

59:41.959 --> 59:45.087
- <i>We need you guys to keep the coast clear.</i>
- Roger that.

59:45.262 --> 59:48.493
Donna, time for Han Solo
and the Death Star.

59:48.666 --> 59:50.293
Trust me. It's a nerd thing.

59:56.240 --> 59:59.505
You've gotta be kidding me.
Not a <i>Star Wars</i> move.

01:00:02.246 --> 01:00:05.238
Oh, no, no, no.

01:00:05.416 --> 01:00:07.850
- No!
- Room service! Room Service.

01:00:08.018 --> 01:00:10.543
- No!
- Room service! Get your free food here!

01:00:13.257 --> 01:00:15.987
Now, I know this looks bad, but...

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.152
And now so do you.

01:00:19.863 --> 01:00:21.455
Oh, no.

01:00:46.924 --> 01:00:49.085
Merry Christmas, Katherine.

01:00:57.301 --> 01:00:59.462
Don't you just wanna take a picture?

01:01:00.804 --> 01:01:04.240
Oh, you're all in so much trouble.

01:01:04.408 --> 01:01:06.433
Just don't wake up my sister, okay?

01:01:07.544 --> 01:01:09.239
Any more requests?

01:01:09.413 --> 01:01:10.675
Milk and cookies?

01:01:10.848 --> 01:01:13.783
A jail cell with a view?

01:01:13.951 --> 01:01:18.081
Mr. Porter, now, I know you probably
don't want to hear this...

01:01:18.255 --> 01:01:22.885
...but I think that maybe you should just
let these kids stay at the hotel.

01:01:23.827 --> 01:01:29.129
- It's Christmas.
- Is that your sage advice, Van Bourke?

01:01:29.299 --> 01:01:33.326
I will take your opinion
into consideration one day...

01:01:33.504 --> 01:01:37.463
...when I actually care what you think.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.643
Oliver...

01:01:45.149 --> 01:01:49.176
...as soon as I get these kids
back on their planes, I quit.

01:01:56.126 --> 01:01:57.616
March.

01:02:04.067 --> 01:02:06.535
Sir, are you taking us to the U.M. room?

01:02:06.703 --> 01:02:09.866
I would never do that to you
on Christmas morning.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.769
- Really?
- No.

01:02:12.075 --> 01:02:15.511
You'll all be much happier
here in your own private rooms.

01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:18.877
- Private rooms?
- You don't expect me to let you...

01:02:19.049 --> 01:02:22.644
...stay together and plan your next assault
on me and my airport?

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.414
It's "my airport and I."

01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:30.458
Hey, get this, Strunk and White,
"me and my airport" is correct.

01:02:31.695 --> 01:02:34.459
- Dang.
- Oh, and by the way...

01:02:34.631 --> 01:02:38.158
...all those stranded passengers
you saw sleeping in the gate area?

01:02:38.335 --> 01:02:42.533
There are too many of them
and not enough planes leaving.

01:02:42.706 --> 01:02:45.402
So I thought
since they followed all the rules...

01:02:45.576 --> 01:02:49.444
...and since you have such nice,
comfortable rooms to stay in...

01:02:49.613 --> 01:02:52.548
...that you wouldn't mind
if I bumped you from your flights...

01:02:52.716 --> 01:02:54.513
...and let them go instead.

01:02:54.685 --> 01:02:56.118
- Sir.
- Don't worry.

01:02:56.286 --> 01:03:00.518
You'll be able to leave this afternoon
or by this evening.

01:03:00.691 --> 01:03:03.717
- Tomorrow for sure.
- You can't do that.

01:03:04.194 --> 01:03:09.393
As a matter of fact,
it's one of the few things I can do.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.629
Lock them up.

01:03:24.014 --> 01:03:26.983
I'll be in my office watching
your every move on camera.

01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:29.914
There'll be guards posted
outside your doors.

01:03:30.087 --> 01:03:31.952
If you find your way out of here...

01:03:32.122 --> 01:03:35.922
...I'll be the first to congratulate you
and admit defeat...

01:03:36.093 --> 01:03:39.551
...because you will have accomplished
the impossible.

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.961
Good luck.

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:48.495
Hey, guys.

01:04:48.665 --> 01:04:52.032
<i>Thanks for all the help with my sister.</i>

01:04:52.202 --> 01:04:55.763
<i>You know, I'm sorry that</i>
<i>all your Christmases have to be ruined...</i>

01:04:55.939 --> 01:04:57.372
...because of me.

01:04:58.609 --> 01:05:02.136
<i>We probably won't see each other again</i>
<i>after our flights leave, so I just...</i>

01:05:02.746 --> 01:05:06.147
...wanted to say
that I had a really good time...

01:05:06.316 --> 01:05:08.978
<i>...and that I think we make</i>
<i>a pretty awesome family.</i>

01:05:09.152 --> 01:05:12.781
<i>Maybe the thing is it's just none of</i>
<i>our families are meant to stay together...</i>

01:05:12.956 --> 01:05:14.253
<i>...you know?</i>
<i>Maybe that's it.</i>

01:05:14.424 --> 01:05:16.289
Except for you, Grace.

01:05:18.795 --> 01:05:21.355
Actually, that's not totally true.

01:05:21.932 --> 01:05:24.196
I thought your parents weren't divorced.

01:05:24.368 --> 01:05:30.068
Well, not from each other,
but they sort of divorced me.

01:05:31.341 --> 01:05:32.638
What do you mean?

01:05:33.343 --> 01:05:36.244
They just don't seem
to like it when I'm around.

01:05:37.981 --> 01:05:41.883
That's why they travel all the time.
They're in Paris right now.

01:05:42.619 --> 01:05:47.022
- So is that where you're going?
- No. I'm already home.

01:05:49.159 --> 01:05:54.859
I live 20 minutes from here.
I flew in today from boarding school.

01:05:55.032 --> 01:05:59.867
I figured it'd be more fun hanging out at the
airport than sitting at home with my nanny.

01:06:01.338 --> 01:06:03.829
She wanted Christmas off anyway.

01:06:07.744 --> 01:06:10.304
Now I'm really depressed.

01:06:17.254 --> 01:06:19.245
You guys have vents in your ceiling?

01:06:21.491 --> 01:06:23.618
- Yeah.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:06:23.794 --> 01:06:26.888
- Then I'm getting us out of here.
- Spencer.

01:06:27.064 --> 01:06:29.157
That guy's watching us on the cameras.

01:06:29.332 --> 01:06:31.095
<i>He'll see everything we do.</i>

01:06:38.709 --> 01:06:40.973
Not if he doesn't see what we're doing.

01:06:50.353 --> 01:06:52.981
Just go to sleep, you little monsters.

01:07:12.242 --> 01:07:14.107
- Okay, phase one finished?
- Check.

01:07:14.277 --> 01:07:15.505
- Check.
- Check.

01:07:15.679 --> 01:07:16.839
Okay. On to phase two.

01:07:17.481 --> 01:07:20.279
What was the worst Christmas gift
you ever got?

01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:24.216
That's easy. My brother Frank gave me
the same Christmas present for 14 years.

01:07:24.387 --> 01:07:25.820
Hated it.

01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:28.023
- What was it?
- A punch in the head.

01:07:28.592 --> 01:07:30.457
Ready? Go.

01:07:34.164 --> 01:07:35.791
What the...?

01:07:41.404 --> 01:07:43.372
Stupid cheap cameras.

01:07:59.089 --> 01:08:01.080
Doesn't get any better than this.

01:08:11.234 --> 01:08:13.702
Oh, we're supposed
to take away chairs.

01:08:24.113 --> 01:08:26.048
- I win!
- Can I say something to you?

01:08:26.216 --> 01:08:28.207
What?

01:08:28.385 --> 01:08:30.353
Who needs Hawaii?

01:08:37.794 --> 01:08:39.352
What?

01:08:52.341 --> 01:08:55.243
Donna? Are you okay?

01:08:55.412 --> 01:08:57.380
It's really small in here.

01:08:57.546 --> 01:08:59.810
I know. It's great, isn't it?

01:08:59.983 --> 01:09:03.680
Charlie, just because you compensate for
your abandonment issues by squeezing...

01:09:03.854 --> 01:09:08.086
...yourself into small, womb-like spaces
doesn't mean everybody else does.

01:09:09.725 --> 01:09:11.990
What?
My mom's a psychologist.

01:09:12.761 --> 01:09:14.889
Donna, I won't let anything
happen to you.

01:09:15.064 --> 01:09:16.497
I promise.

01:09:17.567 --> 01:09:19.466
Thanks.

01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:28.803
Oh, Charlie, you didn't.

01:09:29.446 --> 01:09:32.846
Sorry, I get nervous.
I had a hot dog when I got off the plane.

01:09:33.015 --> 01:09:34.745
Oh, Charlie.

01:09:34.917 --> 01:09:38.479
Yeah, can we hold all of those until
we're out of the confined space, please?

01:09:38.654 --> 01:09:40.054
Will do.

01:09:51.902 --> 01:09:54.131
- Where are you going?
- The food court's this way.

01:09:54.304 --> 01:09:57.603
Trust me.
A few hundred yards and I'll be--

01:09:59.576 --> 01:10:01.737
Charlie!

01:10:01.912 --> 01:10:03.846
Charlie, please tell me you're okay.

01:10:05.715 --> 01:10:08.616
Hey, Donna.
I told you I'd get you out of there.

01:10:11.554 --> 01:10:15.115
This is where Mr. Porter
put all the Christmas decorations.

01:10:19.095 --> 01:10:20.960
Hey, hey!

01:10:21.665 --> 01:10:23.189
Wake up!

01:10:23.366 --> 01:10:26.335
Wake up! Check the rooms, you idiots!

01:10:51.461 --> 01:10:54.919
Does this mean we can go on break?

01:11:02.072 --> 01:11:03.699
All clear.

01:11:09.212 --> 01:11:10.440
I don't think any planes...

01:11:10.613 --> 01:11:12.604
- ...are gonna be flying today.
- Nope.

01:11:13.083 --> 01:11:15.347
Looks like we'll be spending
another day together.

01:11:17.587 --> 01:11:19.179
Sounds good to me.

01:11:31.434 --> 01:11:32.901
Is that...?

01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:42.207
Oh, my gosh.

01:11:54.991 --> 01:11:58.119
Man, wasn't easy getting this
through security.

01:12:04.834 --> 01:12:06.062
It's Christmas.

01:12:06.236 --> 01:12:08.261
You know what, guys?

01:12:09.339 --> 01:12:11.307
I've got an idea.

01:12:25.789 --> 01:12:27.723
Let's do this.

01:12:35.832 --> 01:12:37.993
And then I said, "That is my food."

01:12:38.601 --> 01:12:40.364
Donna, how did you get here?

01:12:41.037 --> 01:12:42.834
Van Bourke...

01:12:44.174 --> 01:12:45.607
...we need your help.

01:12:50.146 --> 01:12:52.706
I need a list of all the kids
traveling with families...

01:12:52.882 --> 01:12:55.043
...and the passengers
traveling by themselves.

01:12:55.218 --> 01:12:58.119
Okay, this one's mine
and that one's yours. Okay?

01:12:58.855 --> 01:13:02.120
Can you also please get the unaccompanied
minors back here at 7 a.m.?

01:13:04.794 --> 01:13:05.988
Oh, one more thing.

01:13:21.444 --> 01:13:24.311
I guess I owe you a congratulations.

01:13:24.481 --> 01:13:26.210
As promised.

01:13:27.117 --> 01:13:29.483
Who trained you kids, the Navy SEALs?

01:13:29.919 --> 01:13:33.582
Look, sir, just-- Divorce kids are
more resourceful than others, that's all.

01:13:34.023 --> 01:13:36.924
Any chance you can tell me
what you're up to now?

01:13:37.327 --> 01:13:39.852
Something nice. You know, nothing bad.
I promise.

01:13:40.029 --> 01:13:43.590
Any chance of you trusting me
and not locking us up again?

01:13:43.766 --> 01:13:46.599
I was just doing my job.
You do know that, right?

01:13:47.537 --> 01:13:52.099
Just like I've just been doing my job
every Christmas for the past 15 years.

01:13:52.742 --> 01:13:55.142
Bet your family hates it
that you work on Christmas.

01:13:55.311 --> 01:13:59.372
Not much of a problem,
since my wife left five Christmases ago.

01:14:00.783 --> 01:14:03.251
That why you don't put up
the decorations?

01:14:03.419 --> 01:14:06.684
Well, let's just say
they don't remind me of happy times.

01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:10.115
We were just, you know,
trying to have a Christmas.

01:14:10.293 --> 01:14:13.057
- We thought you'd care.
- Why would I care?

01:14:13.229 --> 01:14:16.221
This is an airport.
You're passengers.

01:14:16.399 --> 01:14:20.267
- So?
- So passengers leave.

01:14:21.337 --> 01:14:22.770
There's one thing I don't get.

01:14:23.273 --> 01:14:24.865
I bump you off your planes...

01:14:25.275 --> 01:14:28.438
...and I keep you
from your families at Christmas.

01:14:29.179 --> 01:14:32.910
Why do you guys seem
almost happy?

01:14:34.217 --> 01:14:38.415
Because you didn't keep us from our family.
At least, not our new family.

01:14:41.591 --> 01:14:43.081
Right.

01:14:44.661 --> 01:14:46.219
I got it.

01:14:48.264 --> 01:14:49.993
Mr. Porter.

01:14:51.968 --> 01:14:53.595
We got you something.

01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:56.204
Sorry we wrecked your vacation.

01:15:27.637 --> 01:15:30.697
Almost there.
Highway mileage, not city mileage.

01:15:30.873 --> 01:15:33.501
Highway mileage, not city-- Oh, come on!

01:15:33.676 --> 01:15:38.443
Why?! I've already filled you up
five times!

01:15:38.615 --> 01:15:43.609
How can you drink so much?!
You yellow monster!

01:16:12.715 --> 01:16:14.046
Good morning.

01:16:14.517 --> 01:16:18.977
Merry Christmas! Everybody up!

01:16:54.223 --> 01:16:56.123
Happy holidays, everyone.

01:17:25.755 --> 01:17:27.120
Merry Christmas, Katherine.

01:17:27.457 --> 01:17:28.890
Spencer.

01:17:29.058 --> 01:17:31.652
- Spencer, Spencer.
- Oh, whoa, hi.

01:17:33.429 --> 01:17:35.090
Spencer, look what Santa brought me.

01:17:35.264 --> 01:17:37.061
He even brought back Sir Poops-A-Lot.

01:17:37.533 --> 01:17:38.830
Santa's a nice guy, huh?

01:17:44.107 --> 01:17:45.472
Santa came back.

01:17:46.809 --> 01:17:49.334
It's Santa.

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:53.849
- Who is that?
- I thought you knew.

01:17:56.486 --> 01:17:59.751
I hope you've all been
good little boys and girls.

01:18:01.424 --> 01:18:03.585
Okay. Okay. Stay with me.

01:18:04.193 --> 01:18:05.421
- Yes.
- Santa.

01:18:05.595 --> 01:18:07.290
Get me a chair, you idiot.

01:18:09.265 --> 01:18:12.928
- Here you go, Santa, sir.
- Yes. Thank you.

01:18:14.504 --> 01:18:16.768
I'm looking for Owen Marks.

01:18:16.939 --> 01:18:18.167
I'm Owen Marks.

01:18:18.341 --> 01:18:23.176
- Well, merry Christmas, Owen Marks.
- Thanks, Santa.

01:18:23.346 --> 01:18:26.338
Oh, you're welcome, Owen.
Merry Christmas.

01:18:26.516 --> 01:18:28.984
You're not, like, gonna be scared
of him now, are you?

01:18:29.152 --> 01:18:30.779
Not after the night I just had.

01:18:30.953 --> 01:18:35.287
Wait! Wait, wait, wait for me! Wait for me.
I wanna help. I wanna help.

01:18:35.525 --> 01:18:37.823
- Merry Christmas.
- All right. Merry Christmas.

01:18:38.861 --> 01:18:41.386
Man, I'm glad you guys
already have a Santa Claus.

01:18:41.564 --> 01:18:43.395
There was a dead mouse in my costume.

01:18:45.768 --> 01:18:48.896
- Dad?
- Daddy! Daddy!

01:18:49.071 --> 01:18:52.131
Merry Christmas, pumpkin!

01:18:52.308 --> 01:18:54.367
You drove from Pennsylvania for us?

01:18:54.844 --> 01:18:57.369
Of course I did, Spence. I'm your dad.

01:18:57.547 --> 01:19:00.641
Through a blizzard? In your car?

01:19:02.385 --> 01:19:04.216
Yeah. Actually, I...

01:19:04.387 --> 01:19:05.649
I drove a Humvee.

01:19:05.822 --> 01:19:09.918
A Hummer! You drove a Hummer
from Pennsylvania...

01:19:10.092 --> 01:19:11.821
...in a blizzard just to see us.

01:19:11.994 --> 01:19:15.259
Yeah, yeah. But, hey, let's just
talk about happy things, shall we?

01:19:15.431 --> 01:19:18.366
I take back everything
I ever said about you.

01:19:19.902 --> 01:19:22.564
Wait, what--?
What kind of things did you say about me?

01:19:23.005 --> 01:19:24.165
Alan Davies!

01:19:28.744 --> 01:19:29.972
I'm...

01:19:30.146 --> 01:19:31.841
Actually, it's--

01:19:32.248 --> 01:19:33.510
Sorry, I'm 36.

01:19:33.683 --> 01:19:37.414
You're at an airport alone
on Christmas morning, aren't you?

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:39.451
Yes, Santa, I am.

01:19:39.622 --> 01:19:44.355
Well, Alan, come on over
and get your present from Santa.

01:19:47.296 --> 01:19:49.924
Awesome. I'd love a present.

01:19:51.501 --> 01:19:54.629
- A basketball.
- Oh, I love basketball!

01:19:55.671 --> 01:19:59.198
Check this out. I used to be an all-star.
Hey, can you throw that back?

01:20:00.610 --> 01:20:04.774
I have a lot of presents to give away,
but before I do...

01:20:04.981 --> 01:20:09.384
...I just wanna thank my friends over there
for setting all this up.

01:20:09.552 --> 01:20:11.213
If they actually worked for Santa...

01:20:11.387 --> 01:20:13.821
...they'd be fired so fast
their heads would spin.

01:20:14.624 --> 01:20:18.116
But they did a wonderful job
here this morning.

01:20:18.327 --> 01:20:21.626
And since they did,
I want them to know...

01:20:21.797 --> 01:20:25.790
...that they'll be flying out of here
first thing this morning!

01:20:25.968 --> 01:20:28.869
Merry Christmas!

01:20:30.573 --> 01:20:33.906
- You're friends with Santa?
- Yeah.

01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:35.572
I guess I am.

01:20:54.764 --> 01:20:56.356
Hi.

01:20:56.832 --> 01:20:57.992
Do you like dolls?

01:20:59.035 --> 01:21:02.527
I don't know.
Not as much as I used to, I guess.

01:21:02.705 --> 01:21:04.468
I am 12, you know.

01:21:06.409 --> 01:21:08.502
Did you know that I found
that Christmas tree?

01:21:11.614 --> 01:21:13.605
You did? How?

01:21:14.150 --> 01:21:16.675
Let me tell you a little story
about a man called Beef.

01:21:17.086 --> 01:21:18.747
Okay.

01:21:20.523 --> 01:21:23.617
It all started on a cold, stormy night.

01:21:23.793 --> 01:21:26.819
Me and Aquaman started trudging
through the snow.

01:21:27.263 --> 01:21:29.026
Yeah. Yeah, Mom. We're fine.

01:21:29.198 --> 01:21:33.225
You know, it turned out that it wasn't
such a bad night after all, you know?

01:21:35.071 --> 01:21:38.905
In fact it was...
It was actually pretty great.

01:21:39.208 --> 01:21:40.835
So...

01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:44.207
Yeah, I'll call again
when I get to Dad's house.

01:21:45.481 --> 01:21:47.039
Mom?

01:21:47.883 --> 01:21:49.111
I...

01:21:49.285 --> 01:21:50.912
I love you.

01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:56.756
Her name is Lady Sleeps-A-Lot.

01:22:06.202 --> 01:22:07.567
Oh, Val, what's wrong?

01:22:07.737 --> 01:22:10.865
Oh, my gosh. Are the kids okay?

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:13.770
- Honey?
- It's Spencer.

01:22:14.076 --> 01:22:15.668
Well, is he all right?

01:22:16.612 --> 01:22:20.070
He said that he loved me.

01:22:22.485 --> 01:22:26.319
Oh, criminy, Val.
You need to start dating more.

01:22:26.489 --> 01:22:29.322
Do you know how ridiculous you look?

01:22:30.426 --> 01:22:31.984
Really.

01:22:40.136 --> 01:22:43.469
So it's all right if I call you sometime?

01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:46.934
Why do you think I gave you
my phone number, goofball?

01:22:52.948 --> 01:22:57.146
It was nice meeting you, Donna.
You're a very special young lady.

01:23:07.163 --> 01:23:09.358
Man, you're so hot!

01:23:10.366 --> 01:23:12.334
Yeah, I know.

01:23:14.603 --> 01:23:16.662
Other side. The middle.

01:23:16.839 --> 01:23:18.966
Down low. Too slow.

01:23:19.141 --> 01:23:23.271
I should have noticed because "too slow"
rhymes with "down low."

01:23:23.813 --> 01:23:25.644
Why didn't I see that coming?

01:23:25.815 --> 01:23:27.806
Well, hope you have a nice Christmas.

01:23:29.018 --> 01:23:30.212
How could I not?

01:23:30.386 --> 01:23:34.618
Got the whole place to myself.
More fruitcake and eggnog for me.

01:23:38.761 --> 01:23:41.924
Yeah, you know, I was sort of thinking.

01:23:42.098 --> 01:23:45.261
Maybe if you don't wanna go home
quite yet...

01:23:45.434 --> 01:23:47.459
...you know, maybe you could...

01:23:47.636 --> 01:23:50.127
...I don't know, spend Christmas with...

01:23:50.306 --> 01:23:54.299
...my dad and my sister and me.

01:23:58.781 --> 01:24:00.772
Took you long enough, noodle-head.

01:24:01.784 --> 01:24:03.308
Come on.

01:24:08.624 --> 01:24:10.888
Oh, hey.
You guys have any money for gas?

01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:13.528
I kind of maxed out my cards
on the way here.
