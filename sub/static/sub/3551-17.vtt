WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:05.076
WE ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
WE CAN TO GET YOU A KIDNEY.

00:05.076 --> 00:08.109
IN THE MEANTIME, LIVE YOUR LIFE.
IF THERE'S THINGS

00:08.109 --> 00:10.641
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING,
DO THEM NOW.

00:10.641 --> 00:12.283
SUSAN'S CONDITION GOT WORSE.

00:12.283 --> 00:16.587
YOU'RE DYING, AND THERE'S NOT
A DAMN THING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

00:16.587 --> 00:18.489
BETH WAS REJECTED
BY HER HUSBAND...

00:18.489 --> 00:20.721
I KICKED YOU OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

00:20.721 --> 00:23.023
THAT WAS THE END!

00:23.023 --> 00:25.025
AND ABANDONED BY HER MOTHER.

00:25.025 --> 00:28.699
I HAVE NO MORE USE FOR YOU.
GOOD-BYE.

00:28.699 --> 00:30.201
BUT BREE BROUGHT HOPE.

00:30.201 --> 00:33.404
HAS THE TRANSPLANT OFFICE
REACHED YOU?

00:33.404 --> 00:35.136
AM I A MATCH?

00:35.136 --> 00:37.638
UH, YES.
 I'M HERE TO DONATE A KIDNEY.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.111
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

00:40.111 --> 00:43.574
AND BETH MADE
THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.

00:43.574 --> 00:45.045
(gunshot)

00:45.045 --> 00:47.047
WE NEED SOME HELP OVER HERE!

00:53.784 --> 00:55.786
(Mary Alice) WE CAN NEVER KNOW

00:55.786 --> 01:00.461
THE MOMENT OUR LIVES
ARE ABOUT TO CHANGE FOREVER.

01:00.461 --> 01:05.536
WE MIGHT BE PREPARING DINNER...

01:05.536 --> 01:09.800
COMING HOME AFTER A LONG DAY...

01:09.800 --> 01:14.175
ENJOYING A GLASS OF WINE...

01:14.175 --> 01:19.210
TENDING
TO OUR ACHES AND PAINS.

01:19.210 --> 01:20.751
AND THEN...

01:20.751 --> 01:22.753
WHEN WE LEAST EXPECT IT...

01:22.753 --> 01:25.256
(telephone rings)

01:25.256 --> 01:28.489
THE MOMENT COMES.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.461
(ring, beep)

01:30.461 --> 01:31.762
HELLO?

01:31.762 --> 01:33.124
Susan?

01:33.124 --> 01:35.126
THIS IS CRAIG LYNWOOD
FROM FAIRVIEW MEMORIAL.

01:35.126 --> 01:37.128
HELLO?
 Mr. Young,

01:37.128 --> 01:39.470
THIS IS DR. JENKINS
FROM FAIRVIEW MEMORIAL.

01:39.470 --> 01:41.572
WE HAVE A KIDNEY FOR YOU.

01:41.572 --> 01:43.574
WHAT?

01:43.574 --> 01:46.106
I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU THERE'S
BEEN A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.808
WHAT KIND OF ACCIDENT?

01:47.808 --> 01:50.841
YOUR WIFE... SHOT HERSELF.

01:50.841 --> 01:54.815
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD!
MIKE! WE HAVE A KIDNEY!

01:54.815 --> 01:56.817
IS SHE DEAD?

01:56.817 --> 01:58.819
WE'RE KEEPING HER
ON LIFE SUPPORT,

01:58.819 --> 02:00.851
BUT I'M AFRAID
THERE'S NO BRAIN ACTIVITY.

02:00.851 --> 02:03.694
SO... HOW SOON
CAN WE DO THIS?

02:03.694 --> 02:05.626
HOW SOON CAN YOU GET HERE?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.127
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.330
IF THERE'S NO BRAIN FUNCTION,
WHY IS SHE ON LIFE SUPPORT?

02:10.330 --> 02:12.803
YOUR WIFE IS AN ORGAN DONOR,
AND WE NEED TO--

02:12.803 --> 02:14.765
STOP.

02:14.765 --> 02:18.439
YOU ARE NOT TO TOUCH HER
UNTIL I GET THERE.
 (beep)

02:18.439 --> 02:24.615
YES, THERE ARE MOMENTS THAT
CHANGE OUR LIVES FOREVER...

02:24.615 --> 02:28.179
BUT NOT ALWAYS IN THE WAY...

02:28.179 --> 02:43.834
WE MIGHT EXPECT.

02:43.834 --> 02:46.337
THE WOMEN OF WISTERIA LANE

02:46.337 --> 02:49.800
LOOK FOR ANY EXCUSE
TO CELEBRATE--

02:49.800 --> 02:52.403
A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE

02:52.403 --> 02:55.506
WHEN YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING...
 (clink)

02:55.506 --> 02:59.810
A NEW DRESS, FOR TURNING 39...

02:59.810 --> 03:01.512
AGAIN...

03:01.512 --> 03:07.358
A TRIPLE FUDGE CAKE
TO REWARD A PERSONAL BEST.

03:07.358 --> 03:11.222
(elevator bell dings)
 SO WHEN MY FRIENDS HEARD
ABOUT SUSAN'S GOOD FORTUNE,

03:11.222 --> 03:13.724
THEY JUST COULDN'T RESIST.

03:13.724 --> 03:17.398
SURPRISE!

03:17.398 --> 03:20.671
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO
SAY WHEN SOMEONE GETS AN ORGAN?

03:20.671 --> 03:22.673
KIDNEY!

03:22.673 --> 03:25.376
HOW ABOUT "CONGRATULATIONS"?

03:25.376 --> 03:28.639
WE ARE SO THRILLED FOR YOU.
WHEN IS THIS HAPPENING?

03:28.639 --> 03:30.741
I GUESS TONIGHT.

03:30.741 --> 03:33.444
SO WILL YOU STILL BE
AT MY PARTY SATURDAY?

03:33.444 --> 03:36.547
BECAUSE YOU DID R.S.V.P.
 (chuckles) WELL, IT DEPENDS.

03:36.547 --> 03:39.450
CAN YOU MOVE THE PARTY
INTO THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT?

03:39.450 --> 03:42.453
(sighs) SO THAT'S A NO. GABY'S
IN CHARGE OF THE GUEST LIST,

03:42.453 --> 03:45.526
IN CASE ANYBODY ELSE DECIDES
TO FLAKE AT THE LAST MINUTE.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.797
HELLO, SUSAN.

03:46.797 --> 03:49.800
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D BE
BRINGING AN ENTOURAGE.

03:49.800 --> 03:54.004
WELL, IT'S A HAPPY DAY
ON OUR STREET.
 I WOULD IMAGINE,
A BIT OF A SAD ONE, TOO.

03:54.004 --> 03:56.006
NO, I CAN JUST
CALL THE CATERERS,

03:56.006 --> 03:58.809
SAY THERE'S ONE LESS PERSON.
NO BIG DEAL.

03:58.809 --> 04:01.972
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE HARSH?
I MEAN, SHE WAS A NEIGHBOR.

04:01.972 --> 04:05.316
WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 YOUR DONOR, BETH YOUNG.

04:07.378 --> 04:09.550
BETH IS HER DONOR?

04:09.550 --> 04:13.454
WAIT, YOU--YOU DON'T
KNOW ANY OF THIS?

04:15.556 --> 04:17.858
BETH CAME TO THE E.R.
WITH THE TRANSPLANT PAPERS,

04:17.858 --> 04:21.462
AND THEN... SHE SHOT HERSELF.

04:25.636 --> 04:27.638
IS SHE DEAD?

04:27.638 --> 04:30.771
SHE'S ON LIFE SUPPORT,
BUT SHE'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

04:30.771 --> 04:34.745
OH, MY GOD.
 I'M SO SORRY.
I-I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

04:34.745 --> 04:36.577
HER HUSBAND IS
WITH HER NOW.

04:36.577 --> 04:39.049
WE WANT TO GIVE HIM
SOME MORE TIME WITH HER,

04:39.049 --> 04:41.752
SO WE'RE ANTICIPATING
A BIT OF A DELAY.

04:44.455 --> 04:47.618
OH, POOR BETH.

04:47.618 --> 04:51.322
I JUST SAW HER YESTERDAY.

04:51.322 --> 04:52.623
I MEAN, SHE SEEMED OFF,

04:52.623 --> 04:55.295
BUT SHE ALWAYS SEEMED
A LITTLE OFF, SO I LEFT.

04:55.295 --> 05:00.331
HOW COULD I NOT HAVE REALIZED
SHE WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN?

05:00.331 --> 05:03.073
OH, BREE, YOU COULDN'T HAVE
KNOWN THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

05:05.336 --> 05:08.539
ARE YOU OKAY?

05:08.539 --> 05:09.880
I DON'T KNOW.

05:11.942 --> 05:15.946
IT SOUNDS LIKE NOTHING'S
GONNA HAPPEN TONIGHT.

05:15.946 --> 05:19.690
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ALL GO HOME
AND GET SOME SLEEP?

05:21.952 --> 05:25.025
(rings)

05:25.025 --> 05:26.997
(ring, beep)

05:26.997 --> 05:29.029
(sighs) HELLO?

05:29.029 --> 05:30.531
It's Karen.

05:30.531 --> 05:33.534
GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE. I GOT
SOMETHING THAT BELONGS TO YOU.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.636
Little hint--

05:35.636 --> 05:38.639
IT REEKS OF MAI TAIS
AND YOU GAVE BIRTH TO IT!

05:38.639 --> 05:39.640
(beep)

05:41.642 --> 05:44.645
I COME DOWNSTAIRS TO MAKE
BREAKFAST, AND THERE HE IS,

05:44.645 --> 05:46.617
PASSED OUT,
STEWED TO THE GILLS.

05:46.617 --> 05:48.619
AGAIN, KAREN,
WE ARE SO SORRY.

05:48.619 --> 05:51.121
IF I WANTED
A DRUNK HOMO ON MY COUCH,

05:51.121 --> 05:53.654
I WOULD HAVE MARRIED
MY COLLEGE BOYFRIEND.

05:55.686 --> 05:58.689
YOU CAN LET ME GO, ALL RIGHT?
I'M OKAY.

05:58.689 --> 06:01.632
OKAY? YOU BROKE
INTO A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE

06:01.632 --> 06:03.464
AND PASSED OUT.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.466
I DIDN'T BREAK IN. I...

06:05.466 --> 06:08.699
I GOT A LITTLE CONFUSED, AND...

06:08.699 --> 06:10.841
WENT IN THE WRONG HOUSE.

06:10.841 --> 06:15.576
YOU GOT TO ADMIT, ALL THESE
PLACES KIND OF LOOK THE SAME.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.649
WHEN YOU'RE DRUNK!
ANDREW, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

06:18.649 --> 06:20.811
CALM DOWN, ALL RIGHT?

06:20.811 --> 06:24.084
I JUST--I JUST HAD A LITTLE
TOO MUCH FUN LAST NIGHT.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.718
YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL.

06:27.718 --> 06:31.161
THANKS TO ME, YOU HAVE A GENETIC
PREDISPOSITION TO ALCOHOLISM.

06:31.161 --> 06:32.593
WHAT?

06:32.593 --> 06:35.596
JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE ONE, YOU WANT
EVERYONE IN YOUR LITTLE CLUB?

06:35.596 --> 06:37.828
I'M NOT AN ALCOHOLIC, OKAY?

06:37.828 --> 06:40.671
I GOT EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL.

06:45.636 --> 06:48.609
HOW BAD IS IT?

06:48.609 --> 06:50.441
IT'S REALLY BAD.

06:50.441 --> 06:51.842
WHEN DID IT START?

06:51.842 --> 06:55.616
A WHILE AGO. FIRST IT WAS
JUST ON THE WEEKENDS,

06:55.616 --> 06:58.689
THEN SOMETIMES DURING THE WEEK,
AND NOW IT'S EVERY NIGHT.

06:58.689 --> 07:00.751
I WISH YOU HAD TOLD ME.

07:00.751 --> 07:02.753
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'VE STARTED TO DO?

07:02.753 --> 07:04.755
I PRETEND
I HAVE TO WORK LATE,

07:04.755 --> 07:07.427
SO I DON'T HAVE TO
COME HOME AND DEAL WITH HIM.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.200
WELL, YOU NEED TO TALK TO HIM.
 I HAVE,

07:10.200 --> 07:13.764
AND HE PROMISES IT'LL GET
BETTER, BUT IT ONLY GETS WORSE.

07:13.764 --> 07:15.766
(both sigh)

07:15.766 --> 07:19.109
I LOVE HIM, BUT I CAN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE.

07:19.109 --> 07:21.572
I KNOW. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.

07:21.572 --> 07:23.874
NO, BREE. I'M THINKING
OF LEAVING HIM.

07:23.874 --> 07:25.576
PLEASE DON'T. NOT YET.

07:25.576 --> 07:28.819
LET ME TRY TO GET HIM SOME HELP.
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

07:28.819 --> 07:31.582
NO OFFENSE, BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA GET THROUGH TO HIM.

07:31.582 --> 07:33.053
DON'T BE SO SURE.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.055
I ONCE SMUGGLED VODKA
INTO CHURCH

07:35.055 --> 07:37.057
IN A "JESUS SAVES"
SPORTS BOTTLE.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.630
I CAN BE PRETTY RESOURCEFUL.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.464
TABLES AND CHAIRS GO OUT BACK,

07:44.464 --> 07:46.937
CHAFING DISHES AND FLATWARE
IN THE KITCHEN,

07:46.937 --> 07:50.170
AND EYES OFF THE BOOBS,
BUT THANKS FOR NOTICING.

07:50.170 --> 07:53.874
HEY. I SAW THE PARTY RENTAL
TRUCK. WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:53.874 --> 07:56.877
WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT'S FOR
OUR PARTY TOMORROW NIGHT.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.879
WH--OUR SPRING FLING?
WE'RE... STILL FLINGING?

07:58.879 --> 08:00.781
OH, WHY WOULDN'T WE BE?

08:00.781 --> 08:03.183
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
UNLESS THE THEME IS

08:03.183 --> 08:05.686
"NEIGHBORS WHO BLOW THEIR BRAINS
OUT," I KIND OF THOUGHT

08:05.686 --> 08:08.619
THE BETH YOUNG THING MIGHT PUT
A DAMPER ON THE FESTIVITIES.

08:08.619 --> 08:10.521
WHY? SHE WASN'T EVEN INVITED.

08:10.521 --> 08:12.523
WELL,
WE CAN'T IGNORE THE FACT

08:12.523 --> 08:14.525
THAT ONE
OF OUR NEIGHBORS IS DEAD.

08:14.525 --> 08:16.026
BRAIN-DEAD. BIG DIFFERENCE.

08:16.026 --> 08:18.028
BESIDES,
SHE SEEMS LIKE A CLINGER.

08:18.028 --> 08:20.601
BET SHE'LL STICK AROUND
FOR MONTHS.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.834
SO YOU THINK IT'S OKAY THAT
WE STILL THROW THIS PARTY?

08:23.834 --> 08:26.506
GABY, IT'S NOT A PARTY.
IT'S AN EVENT.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.279
WOULD YOU CANCEL THE OSCARS?
CHRISTMAS? NO!

08:29.279 --> 08:32.212
THE INVITATIONS HAVE BEEN SENT,
THE CATERER'S BEEN HIRED.

08:32.212 --> 08:36.015
LIFE IS FOR THE LIVING,
SO LET'S LIVE.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.019
WELL, THE LIVING DID BUY
A NEW DRESS...

08:39.019 --> 08:40.691
VERSACE.

08:40.691 --> 08:42.852
AND I'M SURE
BETH WOULD HAVE LOVED

08:42.852 --> 08:45.055
TO HAVE SEEN YOU
IN THAT VERSACE.

08:45.055 --> 08:47.197
SHE WOULD HAVE, WOULDN'T SHE?

08:47.197 --> 08:50.530
IN A--IN A WAY,
IT COULD BE A TRIBUTE TO HER.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.864
AND I DID SEE THE PERFECT
TRIBUTE SHOES AT THE MALL.

08:53.864 --> 08:55.866
NOW THAT IS THE SPIRIT.

08:55.866 --> 08:58.869
NOW MAKE SURE THE GUESTS KNOW
THE PARTY IS STILL ON,

08:58.869 --> 09:01.972
AND I WILL TAKE CARE
OF THE ARRANGEMENTS HERE.

09:01.972 --> 09:04.975
OH, AND, UH, MAYBE WE COULD
HAVE A MOMENT OF SILENCE

09:04.975 --> 09:07.247
AND THEN A CHAMPAGNE TOAST
IN BETH'S HONOR.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.950
OH, FABULOUS IDEA,
EXCEPT INSTEAD OF CHAMPAGNE,

09:09.950 --> 09:13.153
LET'S DO MOJITOS, AND INSTEAD
OF BETH, LET'S TOAST TO US.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.886
AND THE MOMENT OF SILENCE?

09:15.886 --> 09:18.989
WOULD SOUND GREAT
WITH MUSIC.

09:22.092 --> 09:24.094
OH. SORRY.

09:24.094 --> 09:26.637
(woman over P.A.)
...PLEASE PICK UP 2-2-8-7.

09:26.637 --> 09:30.971
SATELLITE PHARMACY,
PLEASE PICK UP 2-2-8-7.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.874
(telephone rings)

09:33.874 --> 09:36.877
(indistinct conversations)

09:36.877 --> 09:39.880
PAUL, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW SORRY I AM.

09:41.812 --> 09:44.114
CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.288
(sighs)

09:54.625 --> 09:57.367
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW GRATEFUL I AM

09:57.367 --> 10:00.971
FOR THIS GIFT
THAT BETH IS GIVING ME.

10:00.971 --> 10:03.834
OBVIOUSLY, IT DOESN'T
BRING HER BACK.

10:03.834 --> 10:07.738
BUT I HOPE IT WILL BE
A SMALL COMFORT TO YOU

10:07.738 --> 10:12.342
KNOWING THAT IN SOME WAY
SHE'LL LIVE ON.

10:12.342 --> 10:16.246
WHY WOULD THAT
GIVE ME COMFORT?

10:16.246 --> 10:18.248
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME

10:18.248 --> 10:21.621
THAT MY WIFE IS DEAD AND THAT
YOU'RE THE CONSOLATION PRIZE?

10:21.621 --> 10:24.194
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING--

10:24.194 --> 10:26.997
I HATE TO DISAPPOINT YOU,
SUSAN, BUT MY WIFE'S NOT DEAD.

10:26.997 --> 10:28.298
SHE'S VERY MUCH ALIVE.

10:28.298 --> 10:30.831
THEY TOLD ME
THERE WAS NO CHANCE--

10:30.831 --> 10:32.833
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THEY TOLD YOU.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.836
BETH IS ALIVE, AND I INTEND
TO KEEP HER THAT WAY

10:35.836 --> 10:38.809
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.
I'M NOT GOING TO ALLOW YOU

10:38.809 --> 10:41.111
TO STRIP HER FOR PARTS
LIKE SOME ABANDONED CAR.

10:41.111 --> 10:44.414
THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING
HERE. THIS WAS BETH'S IDEA.

10:44.414 --> 10:47.417
BETH WAS NOT IN HER RIGHT MIND
WHEN SHE SIGNED THOSE FORMS.

10:47.417 --> 10:50.120
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
THEY MEAN NOTHING.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.983
AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU DESERVE HER KIDNEY?

10:52.983 --> 10:55.756
WAS IT THOSE MEALS
YOU SHARED WITH HER?

10:55.756 --> 10:58.058
ALL THE GIRLS' NIGHTS
YOU INCLUDED HER IN?

10:58.058 --> 11:00.831
THE LITTLE GESTURES
OF KINDNESS YOU OFFERED

11:00.831 --> 11:03.193
TO MAKE HER FEEL LESS ALONE?

11:03.193 --> 11:04.935
(scoffs) RIGHT.

11:04.935 --> 11:07.167
YOU GAVE HER NOTHING IN LIFE,

11:07.167 --> 11:10.370
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN DEATH.

11:26.987 --> 11:30.190
I DON'T GET THIS.
BETH SIGNED THE DONATION FORMS

11:30.190 --> 11:33.023
AND A LIVING WILL.
THOSE ARE LEGAL DOCUMENTS.

11:33.023 --> 11:35.826
AREN'T THEY BINDING?
 YES AND NO.

11:35.826 --> 11:39.329
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO A LITTLE
BETTER THAN "YES AND NO."

11:39.329 --> 11:42.332
YES, THEY'LL STAND UP IN COURT,
BUT THIS HOSPITAL'S NOT INCLINED

11:42.332 --> 11:45.035
TO WAGE A LEGAL BATTLE
AGAINST A GRIEVING HUSBAND.

11:45.035 --> 11:46.436
IT'S TOO DELICATE.

11:46.436 --> 11:49.439
HE'S NOT A GRIEVING HUSBAND.
PAUL YOUNG HAS A VENDETTA

11:49.439 --> 11:51.141
AGAINST MY FAMILY.

11:51.141 --> 11:55.085
HE'S ONLY DOING THIS
TO MAKE US SUFFER.

11:55.085 --> 11:57.087
LOOK, WE CAN'T
PUBLICLY SUPPORT YOU,

11:57.087 --> 11:59.219
BUT IF YOU DECIDE
TO TAKE THIS ON,

11:59.219 --> 12:01.221
WE WON'T STAND IN YOUR WAY.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.294
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS ON.

12:04.294 --> 12:06.196
NO, WE'RE NOT.

12:06.196 --> 12:08.198
SUSAN--

12:08.198 --> 12:11.331
WE'RE NOT FIGHTING PAUL.
 THIS IS YOUR LIFE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

12:11.331 --> 12:15.735
WE CAN'T LET HIM WIN.
 WIN? HIS WIFE SHOT HERSELF.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.838
AND YOU WANT TO, WHAT,

12:17.838 --> 12:19.840
HIRE LAWYERS?
DRAG HIM TO COURT?

12:19.840 --> 12:22.973
I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE ONLY THINKING OF ME,

12:22.973 --> 12:26.016
BUT THIS IS
PAUL'S DECISION TO MAKE.

12:26.016 --> 12:28.849
IT'S NOT OURS.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.283
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

12:44.364 --> 12:47.067
THANKS FOR HELPING ME
DROP THESE OFF.

12:47.067 --> 12:50.070
YEAH, NO PROBLEM. IT'S NICE
TO BE OUT OF THE HOUSE.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.042
WHEN DID YOU START
CATERING AGAIN?

12:52.042 --> 12:54.344
OH, IT'S NOTHING OFFICIAL,
JUST WHEN I'M NEEDED.

12:54.344 --> 12:56.046
AND WHO'S THE CLIENT?

12:56.046 --> 12:59.249
UM... THEY PREFER
TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS.

13:05.385 --> 13:08.018
COFFEE? DOUGHNUTS?

13:08.018 --> 13:10.520
THE OLD DRUNK GUY
FROM OUTSIDE THE SUPERMARKET?

13:10.520 --> 13:12.392
THIS IS AN A.A. MEETING.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.294
IT'S A WONDERFUL PROGRAM.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.027
LYING TO YOUR SON--
WHICH STEP IS THAT?

13:17.027 --> 13:18.128
I'M SORRY.

13:18.128 --> 13:20.901
BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE,
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT A TRY?

13:20.901 --> 13:23.403
JUST LISTEN TO PEOPLE'S SHARES
AND SEE IF YOU RELATE.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.406
AND WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY
WHEN I GET UP THERE AND TALK?

13:26.406 --> 13:29.179
"HELLO, MY NAME IS ANDREW.
MY MOMMY BROUGHT ME"?

13:29.179 --> 13:31.842
NO ONE HAS TO KNOW
WE'RE RELATED. ANDREW, PLEASE.

13:31.842 --> 13:34.114
JUST ONE MEETING.
IT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE.

13:34.114 --> 13:37.988
HEY. I SEE YOU'VE MET BREE.
MY NAME'S TOMMY. WELCOME.

13:37.988 --> 13:39.289
FIRST TIME?

13:39.289 --> 13:43.954
YES, FIRST TIME.
UH, MY NAME IS... ELVIS.

13:43.954 --> 13:48.028
ELVIS. REALLY?
THAT'S YOUR NAME?

13:48.028 --> 13:49.329
YES, IT'S ELVIS.

13:49.329 --> 13:53.033
YET ANOTHER REASON FOR ME
TO BE MAD AT MY MOTHER.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.334
(chuckles)

13:54.334 --> 13:56.036
(chuckles)

13:58.038 --> 14:00.040
HEY. HOW'D IT GO?

14:00.040 --> 14:03.143
AH, WE WOULD HAVE PLAYED BETTER
IF THERE WAS A WINDMILL.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.876
LYNETTE, THIS IS GLENN MORRIS,
C.E.O. OF MORRIS TECHNOLOGIES...

14:05.876 --> 14:08.178
OH.
 AND A MAN WHO CAN THROW A 6-IRON

14:08.178 --> 14:10.881
FARTHER THAN
HE CAN HIT WITH ONE.
 NICE TO MEET YOU.

14:10.881 --> 14:13.924
NICE TO MEET YOU.
 SO YOU GUYS WANT TO
COME OVER FOR A BEER?

14:13.924 --> 14:16.426
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SHOULD GO. NEXT TIME.
 BYE.

14:16.426 --> 14:18.929
(Tom) SEE YA.
 WELL, NICE TO MEET YA.

14:18.929 --> 14:21.561
HEY, DO YOU MIND
IF I USE THE FACILITIES

14:21.561 --> 14:24.394
BEFORE I HIT THE ROAD?
 NO. COME ON IN.

14:24.394 --> 14:25.865
THE BATHROOM'S DOWN THERE.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.039
WE HAVE FIVE KIDS.
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SQUINT.

14:29.039 --> 14:31.972
ACTUALLY, I DON'T NEED
A BATHROOM. I NEED A C.F.O.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.473
WHAT?

14:33.473 --> 14:36.146
MY CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
TOOK A JOB IN LONDON,

14:36.146 --> 14:40.210
AND THERE'S ONE NAME ON MY LIST
FOR HIS REPLACEMENT--TOM SCAVO.

14:40.210 --> 14:43.954
(gasps) TOM SCAVO--
I KNOW THAT GUY.

14:43.954 --> 14:46.917
GLENN,
WHERE'D THIS COME FROM?

14:46.917 --> 14:49.219
WELL, CARLOS IS ALWAYS
BRAGGING ABOUT YOU,

14:49.219 --> 14:52.622
SO I STARTED ASKING AROUND. COME
TO FIND OUT EVERYBODY LOVES YOU.

14:52.622 --> 14:55.295
WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE
ABOUT TOM SCAVO?

14:55.295 --> 14:58.298
I'M PREPARED TO GIVE YOU
A VERY GENEROUS SALARY,

14:58.298 --> 15:00.900
STOCK OPTIONS,
ACCESS TO THE COMPANY JET.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.433
WOW, THIS IS AMAZING.

15:03.433 --> 15:05.105
BUT NO.

15:05.105 --> 15:08.108
WELL, WE JUST FOUND SOMETHING
NOT TO LOVE ABOUT TOM SCAVO.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.339
WHAT?

15:09.339 --> 15:11.942
CARLOS IS A CLOSE FRIEND,
AND WE'RE JUST STARTING

15:11.942 --> 15:14.244
OUR BUSY SEASON.
I CAN'T LEAVE HIM IN THE LURCH.

15:14.244 --> 15:17.547
LOOK, TOM, I DON'T WANT TO
BUY A MAN OUT OF HIS LOYALTY--

15:17.547 --> 15:20.520
YOU COULD TRY. IT NEVER
HURTS TO PUT IN AN OFFER.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.923
LYNETTE... GLENN, YOU HAVE
MADE MY DAY, BUT I GOTTA PASS.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.226
THIS CONVERSATION ISN'T OVER.
I HOPE YOU'RE GONNA

15:26.226 --> 15:28.698
TALK SOME SENSE
INTO THIS HUSBAND OF YOURS.

15:28.698 --> 15:31.201
TALK, BEAT,
WHATEVER GETS THE JOB DONE.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.636
(door closes)
 OKAY. NOW IS WHEN YOU WINK,
RUB YOUR HANDS TOGETHER,

15:36.636 --> 15:39.639
AND TELL ME YOU WERE PLAYING
THAT MAN LIKE A FIDDLE,

15:39.639 --> 15:43.213
'CAUSE THIS BLANK STARE...

15:43.213 --> 15:46.476
THAT'S NOT FADING
IS SCARING THE HELL OUT OF ME.

15:46.476 --> 15:48.478
I'M NOT GONNA
SCREW OVER CARLOS.

15:48.478 --> 15:50.981
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO INTEGRITY?

15:50.981 --> 15:52.482
NOTHING.

15:52.482 --> 15:55.685
IT GOT A BETTER OFFER FROM GLENN
AND TURNED INTO PROSPERITY.

15:55.685 --> 15:58.958
LYNETTE, AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE
YOU TRYING TO RUN MY LIFE,

15:58.958 --> 16:01.661
THIS IS MY DECISION,
AND I'M SAYING NO.

16:07.267 --> 16:10.270
OKAY. UM... IT LOOKS LIKE
WE HAVE A LITTLE TIME LEFT.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.742
ANYONE ELSE WANT TO SHARE?

16:12.742 --> 16:14.644
ELVIS?

16:14.644 --> 16:18.348
IT'S NOT MANDATORY,
BUT WE'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU.

16:18.348 --> 16:20.350
ELVIS?

16:20.350 --> 16:21.651
OH.

16:21.651 --> 16:24.254
UH, NO, THANKS. I-I PASS.

16:24.254 --> 16:28.118
THIS IS A SAFE PLACE. NO ONE
HERE IS GOING TO JUDGE YOU.

16:30.660 --> 16:33.663
OKAY. YOU KNOW... (sighs)

16:33.663 --> 16:35.665
WHEN I HEAR YOU GUYS TALK

16:35.665 --> 16:38.128
ABOUT HOW OTHER PEOPLE
TRY TO CONTROL YOUR LIVES,

16:38.128 --> 16:40.630
LIKE, UH,
ED HERE WITH HIS BOSS

16:40.630 --> 16:44.634
OR... OH,
MARY ANN WITH HER... CAT,

16:44.634 --> 16:46.636
YOU KNOW, I CAN RELATE.

16:46.636 --> 16:50.640
YOU KNOW, I HAVE THE SAME KIND
OF PROBLEM WITH... MY MOTHER.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.415
YOU KNOW, I-I THINK
HER GREATEST REGRET IN LIFE

16:55.415 --> 16:58.588
IS THE FACT THAT SHE GAVE BIRTH
TO A SON AND NOT A PUPPET.

16:58.588 --> 17:00.050
(laughter)

17:00.050 --> 17:02.652
SHE'S SUCH A CONTROL FREAK

17:02.652 --> 17:05.095
THAT MY SISTER AND I USED TO
CALL HER "ATTILA THE MOM."

17:05.095 --> 17:06.096
(laughter)

17:06.096 --> 17:09.459
COULD WE NOT LAUGH?

17:09.459 --> 17:10.760
I MEAN... (chuckles)

17:10.760 --> 17:13.532
WE'RE TRYING TO HEAL HERE.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.236
NOTHING I EVER DID
WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.807
LIKE IN THE TENTH GRADE,

17:17.807 --> 17:20.510
I-I WANTED TO RUN FOR--
FOR CLASS PRESIDENT,

17:20.510 --> 17:23.613
AND THE NIGHT BEFORE
I WAS GONNA ANNOUNCE, SHE SAID,

17:23.613 --> 17:25.615
"ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

17:25.615 --> 17:28.078
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
A BORN LEADER."

17:28.078 --> 17:30.350
OUCH. SHE SOUNDS AWFUL.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.622
OR DOES SHE SOUND
LIKE A LOVING MOTHER

17:32.622 --> 17:35.625
TRYING TO PROTECT HER SON
FROM DISAPPOINTMENT?
 I DON'T THINK SO,

17:35.625 --> 17:38.628
'CAUSE SHE WOULDN'T EVEN
LISTEN TO MY SPEECH.
 WELL, MAYBE SHE WAS BUSY

17:38.628 --> 17:42.662
PREPARING DINNER FOR A FAMILY OF
FOUR WITH NO HELP FROM HER SON.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.694
YEAH, IT IS HARD WORK
MAKING DINNER

17:44.694 --> 17:48.538
WHILE MAINTAINING AN ATMOSPHERE
OF EMOTIONAL REPRESSION.
 WELL, IF YOU ASK ME,

17:48.538 --> 17:51.241
SOME EMOTIONS COULD
STAND TO BE REPRESSED.

17:51.241 --> 17:52.572
UH, BREE?

17:52.572 --> 17:55.105
I'M SORRY, BUT WE'RE HERE TO
STOP DRINKING, NOT CRITICIZE

17:55.105 --> 17:57.807
THE WOMEN WHO GAVE US LIFE.
 HE'S JUST TRYING TO SHARE.

17:57.807 --> 18:02.112
WELL, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN SHARING AND WHINING.

18:02.112 --> 18:06.456
OKAY. UH, WE ARE DEFINITELY OUT
OF TIME. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

18:06.456 --> 18:10.420
NOW LET'S JUST JOIN HANDS
AND RECITE THE SERENITY PRAYER.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.223
(Tommy sighs)

18:13.223 --> 18:14.224
GOD...

18:14.224 --> 18:15.565
(all) GRANT ME THE SERENITY

18:15.565 --> 18:18.198
TO ACCEPT THE THINGS
I CANNOT CHANGE,

18:18.198 --> 18:22.402
THE COURAGE TO CHANGE
THE THINGS THAT I CAN,

18:22.402 --> 18:27.407
AND THE WISDOM
TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

18:36.546 --> 18:38.518
SO I JUST WANTED TO REMIND YOU

18:38.518 --> 18:40.820
ABOUT THE PARTY RENEE AND I
ARE THROWING TOMORROW NIGHT.

18:40.820 --> 18:44.194
YOU'RE STILL HAVING THAT THING?
A WOMAN'S ON LIFE SUPPORT.
 EXACTLY.

18:44.194 --> 18:47.427
SHE'S NOT DEAD. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
MAKING MY ARGUMENT FOR ME.

18:47.427 --> 18:50.300
PUT ROY AND ME DOWN FOR A "NO,"
BUT PLEASE,

18:50.300 --> 18:53.563
CALL US WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR
HURRICANE KATRINA POOL PARTY.

18:53.563 --> 18:55.535
(door slams)

18:55.535 --> 18:59.539
SO... RENEE AND I ARE
STILL HAVING OUR PARTY...

18:59.539 --> 19:02.242
ARE YOU NUTS? IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD, OUR FRIEND

19:02.242 --> 19:04.774
ACROSS THE STREET, BETTY YOUNG,
JUST BLEW HER BRAINS OUT.

19:04.774 --> 19:06.376
BETH YOUNG.

19:06.376 --> 19:09.479
OH. I GOT HER NAME WRONG.
HOW DISRESPECTFUL.

19:09.479 --> 19:12.522
OH, I HOPE YOU DON'T TELL THAT
STORY TOMORROW AT YOUR PARTY.

19:15.485 --> 19:18.288
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
NEIGHBORHOOD GATHERING...

19:18.288 --> 19:20.390
GABRIELLE,
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

19:20.390 --> 19:21.691
OH, BOY.

19:21.691 --> 19:24.694
I KNOW WE DIDN'T KNOW BETH
VERY WELL, BUT WE DID KNOW

19:24.694 --> 19:27.697
MARY ALICE, AND THIS TRAGIC
EVENT HAS BROUGHT UP A LOT OF

19:27.697 --> 19:30.740
PAINFUL MEMORIES FOR ALL OF US.
HOW COULD YOU NOT REALIZE THAT?

19:30.740 --> 19:34.444
WELL, THEY CAN ALL GO TO HELL.
WE'RE STILL HAVING THE PARTY.
 ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

19:34.444 --> 19:36.946
I GOT FOUR
"ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MINDS,"

19:36.946 --> 19:38.948
THREE "YOU MAKE ME
WANT TO PUKE,"

19:38.948 --> 19:41.581
AND ONE "MAYBE," FROM LEE.
THE MESSAGE IS PRETTY CLEAR.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.953
YEAH. "ORDER LESS SHRIMP."

19:43.953 --> 19:45.915
NO. RENEE, WE CAN'T
HAVE THIS PARTY.

19:45.915 --> 19:48.918
WE SHOULD HAVE CANCELED
THE MOMENT WE HEARD ABOUT BETH.

19:48.918 --> 19:51.561
AH, NOBODY EVEN LIKED HER.
 IT DOESN'T MATTER.

19:51.561 --> 19:54.464
IT'S IN HORRIBLE TASTE. WHY
CAN'T WE JUST CHANGE THE DATE?

19:54.464 --> 19:55.765
NO! FOR TEN YEARS

19:55.765 --> 19:58.428
I'VE HAD MY SPRING FLING
THE FIRST SUNDAY OF APRIL,

19:58.428 --> 20:00.830
NOT THE SECOND SUNDAY,
NOT THE THIRD,

20:00.830 --> 20:03.333
AND NOT WHEN
A BUNCH OF WIMPS DECIDE

20:03.333 --> 20:05.975
THEY'RE READY TO STOP MOPING.
I'M NOT CANCELING THE PARTY.

20:05.975 --> 20:08.408
BUT NOBODY'S GONNA BE HERE.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.410
OH, WELL,
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT. (scoffs)

20:10.410 --> 20:13.383
MY SOCIAL LIFE IS NOT GONNA
COME TO A STOP JUST BECAUSE

20:13.383 --> 20:16.416
SOME CUCKOO BIRD DECIDES TO
CLEAN HER EARS WITH A HANDGUN.

20:18.488 --> 20:21.351
WOW. THANK YOU.

20:21.351 --> 20:22.492
FOR WHAT?

20:22.492 --> 20:24.454
MAKING ME
THE COMPASSIONATE ONE.

20:30.860 --> 20:32.862
(sighs)

20:32.862 --> 20:34.864
WOW. IS HE ASLEEP ALREADY?

20:34.864 --> 20:36.836
YEAH, HE WAS EXHAUSTED.

20:36.836 --> 20:40.340
NOT EVEN HARRY POTTER
COULD KEEP HIM AWAKE TONIGHT.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.643
LOOK, I'M NOT TRYING
TO UPSET YOU, AND I'M NOT MAD,

20:43.643 --> 20:45.645
BUT I NEED TO KNOW

20:45.645 --> 20:48.578
WHY YOU WON'T LET ME FIGHT
TO GET YOU THE KIDNEY.

20:51.621 --> 20:55.024
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST, UH... (sighs)

20:55.024 --> 20:56.926
IT JUST FEELS WRONG.

20:56.926 --> 21:00.390
WELL, IT SHOULDN'T.
BETH WANTED YOU TO HAVE IT.

21:00.390 --> 21:05.365
EXACTLY. SHE KILLED HERSELF
SO I COULD HAVE HER KIDNEY. WHY?

21:05.365 --> 21:07.367
PAUL'S RIGHT. I NEVER HAD

21:07.367 --> 21:09.839
SO MUCH AS A PLEASANT EXCHANGE
WITH THE WOMAN.

21:09.839 --> 21:12.342
I DON'T KNOW
THAT THE REASON MATTERS.

21:12.342 --> 21:14.844
WHAT MATTERS IS,
IT WAS HER FINAL WISH.

21:14.844 --> 21:16.846
BUT IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

21:16.846 --> 21:20.350
(sighs)

21:20.350 --> 21:23.953
I CAN'T TAKE HER KIDNEY,
KNOWING THAT MAYBE

21:23.953 --> 21:27.457
I'M THE REASON
SHE'S LYING IN THAT HOSPITAL.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.298
(switch clicks)
 HEY. HEY, I'M--I'M READING.

21:39.298 --> 21:43.302
OH, GOOD EVENING, SIR.
WELCOME ABOARD.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.975
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING
BEFORE WE...

21:45.975 --> 21:48.037
TAKE OFF?

21:50.380 --> 21:54.313
OOH. YOU COULD HELP ME
PUT MY BAG UNDER THE SEAT.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.686
OKAY, YOU'RE NOT
GOOD AT THIS,

21:56.686 --> 21:58.648
SO LET ME DO THE TALKING.

21:58.648 --> 22:02.692
(gasps) MAY I HELP YOU
WITH YOUR SEAT BELT?

22:02.692 --> 22:04.354
OH, LOOK--

22:04.354 --> 22:06.926
YOU'RE ALREADY IN THE UPRIGHT
AND LOCKED POSITION.

22:06.926 --> 22:10.860
(grunts) WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THIS AIRLINE?

22:10.860 --> 22:13.363
I WANT TO BECOME
A FREQUENT FLYER.

22:13.363 --> 22:15.505
OH, THIS ISN'T
A COMMERCIAL AIRLINE, SIR.

22:15.505 --> 22:20.610
HOTSHOT EXECUTIVES LIKE YOU
ONLY FLY ON THE CORPORATE JET.

22:20.610 --> 22:22.612
MMM.
 HEY, L-LYNETTE?

22:22.612 --> 22:25.575
MM-HMM?
 I'M--I'M NOT TAKING
THAT JOB.

22:25.575 --> 22:27.747
UGH.

22:27.747 --> 22:30.380
WELL, THEN YOU'LL BE HANDLING
YOUR OWN BAGS FROM NOW ON.

22:30.380 --> 22:32.021
LYNETTE,
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

22:32.021 --> 22:34.524
I-I WON'T LEAVE CARLOS
IN THE LURCH.

22:34.524 --> 22:39.358
OKAY, GREAT. YOU'RE LOYAL.
I LOVE THAT.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.030
BUT YOUR STOCK
WENT WAY UP TODAY.

22:41.030 --> 22:43.092
IF YOU'RE GONNA STAY PUT,
AT LEAST COULD YOU TRY

22:43.092 --> 22:45.565
TO GET SOMETHING
OUT OF THIS?

22:45.565 --> 22:48.398
WELL, I COULD TELL CARLOS
ABOUT THE OFFER,

22:48.398 --> 22:50.369
SEE IF HE'LL MATCH
THE NUMBER.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.002
MATCH THE NUMBER?
(gasps)

22:53.002 --> 22:55.945
OH, LOOK--

22:55.945 --> 22:57.847
A SEAT JUST OPENED UP.

22:57.847 --> 22:59.949
(moans)

23:07.717 --> 23:09.559
(buzzer sounds)

23:12.562 --> 23:14.093
(door closes)

23:14.093 --> 23:16.095
I WONDERED
IF YOU WOULD COME.

23:16.095 --> 23:19.068
THEY TOLD ME AT THE HOSPITAL
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO HAVE BETH

23:19.068 --> 23:22.832
DECLARED DEAD
AND HER LIFE SUPPORT TURNED OFF.

23:22.832 --> 23:24.403
YES.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.806
WELL, THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.107
IT HAS TO.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.510
WHY?
 BECAUSE SHE'S DEAD.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.682
NO, SHE'S NOT.

23:32.682 --> 23:36.586
MY DAUGHTER'S DEAD.

23:36.586 --> 23:39.819
YOUR WIFE IS DEAD.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.991
AND WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT KILLED HER.

23:41.991 --> 23:44.454
IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO BLAME ME FOR THIS...

23:44.454 --> 23:47.557
IF THIS IS YOUR LAST ATTEMPT
TO USE HER TO HURT ME...

23:47.557 --> 23:50.860
NO. WE DON'T GET TO USE HER
ANYMORE, PAUL.

23:50.860 --> 23:55.535
THIS... SICK GAME
YOU AND I PLAY,

23:55.535 --> 24:00.540
THIS HATE WE HURL AT EACH OTHER
HAS FINALLY FOUND A VICTIM--

24:00.540 --> 24:03.042
THE ONLY INNOCENT PERSON
IN THE GAME.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.574
I DID NOTHING.

24:04.574 --> 24:08.217
YOU REFUSED TO BELIEVE
SHE LOVED YOU.

24:08.217 --> 24:12.021
I TURNED HER AWAY
BECAUSE SHE DID.

24:14.023 --> 24:16.986
AND NOW SHE'S GONE.

24:16.986 --> 24:21.130
SHE...

24:21.130 --> 24:23.533
MAYBE SHE CAN RECOVER.

24:23.533 --> 24:25.895
I BELIEVE SHE CAN.
YOU MUST BELIEVE IT, TOO,

24:25.895 --> 24:28.598
OR YOU WOULDN'T BE
IN HERE PRAYING FOR HER.

24:28.598 --> 24:30.900
I'M NOT PRAYING FOR HER.

24:30.900 --> 24:34.243
I'M PRAYING
FOR FORGIVENESS.

24:34.243 --> 24:37.707
WE DID THIS TO HER, PAUL.

24:37.707 --> 24:39.779
NOW WE HAVE TO STOP.

24:42.712 --> 24:46.055
AND WE HAVE
TO LET HER REST.

24:51.220 --> 24:52.892
(buzzer sounds)

24:58.027 --> 25:01.100
HI. CAN I COME IN?

25:01.100 --> 25:02.802
SURE.

25:07.036 --> 25:09.038
I'M ON MY WAY TO A MEETING

25:09.038 --> 25:11.040
AND I WAS HOPING
YOU MIGHT JOIN ME.

25:11.040 --> 25:15.184
LOOK, THE DEAL WAS ONE MEETING,
MOM. I WENT AND I'M DONE.

25:15.184 --> 25:17.847
YOU WON'T GO BACK?
EVEN FOR ME?

25:17.847 --> 25:21.991
NOPE. ELVIS HAS
LEFT THE BUILDING.

25:21.991 --> 25:27.557
LOOK, I DON'T NEED TO GO,
ALL RIGHT? I'M FINE.

25:27.557 --> 25:32.231
I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT
"I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM"

25:32.231 --> 25:34.533
IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CLICHéS
IN OUR PLAYBOOK.

25:34.533 --> 25:38.167
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I HAVE PLENTY OF PROBLEMS.

25:38.167 --> 25:40.009
I-I HAVE NO JOB.

25:40.009 --> 25:43.773
ALEX WORKS THESE CRAZY
18-HOUR SHIFTS AT THE HOSPITAL.

25:43.773 --> 25:45.074
WHAT'S MY DAY?

25:45.074 --> 25:49.879
LONG, ENDLESS STRETCHES
OF NOTHING.

25:49.879 --> 25:54.023
I WORK OUT. I DO LAUNDRY.

25:54.023 --> 25:59.659
I-I DUSTED THE OTHER DAY--
ACTUALLY DUSTED AND FELT PROUD.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.891
HOW PATHETIC IS THAT?

26:01.891 --> 26:03.963
I DON'T FIND THAT PATHETIC.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.995
I KNOW YOU DON'T.

26:05.995 --> 26:10.199
LOOK, THE ONE THING
THAT GETS ME THROUGH

26:10.199 --> 26:13.843
IS--IS KNOWING THAT
WHEN THE NIGHT ROLLS AROUND,

26:13.843 --> 26:16.876
I CAN JUST HAVE A FEW DRINKS
AND KICK BACK.

26:16.876 --> 26:21.210
AND AS LONG AS I DON'T HURT
ANYONE, I THINK I'M ALLOWED.

26:21.210 --> 26:23.252
MOM, TRUST ME.

26:23.252 --> 26:26.856
I'LL BE OKAY.

26:29.018 --> 26:31.891
IF YOU SAY SO.

26:37.827 --> 26:39.128
(sighs)

26:46.836 --> 26:48.878
(door opens)

26:48.878 --> 26:50.840
(door closes)

26:50.840 --> 26:52.882
WHAT?
 YOU LISTEN TO ME.

26:52.882 --> 26:55.214
THERE'S BEEN A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

26:55.214 --> 26:58.317
A WOMAN FELT DESPERATE AND ALONE
AND KILLED HERSELF

26:58.317 --> 27:00.149
BECAUSE NOBODY CARED ENOUGH
TO HELP HER.

27:00.149 --> 27:02.852
AND THE THING IS,
I WAS THERE.

27:02.852 --> 27:05.624
I SAW THAT SOMETHING
WAS WRONG...

27:05.624 --> 27:07.897
AND I WALKED AWAY.

27:07.897 --> 27:11.360
AND I AM NEVER GONNA
LET MYSELF DO THAT AGAIN,

27:11.360 --> 27:14.333
AND CERTAINLY NOT WITH YOU.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.771
(voice breaking)
ALEX LEFT ME.

27:21.771 --> 27:23.372
(whispers) OH, MY...

27:23.372 --> 27:27.016
I GUESS HE JUST GOT SICK
OF LIVING WITH A DRUNK.

27:27.016 --> 27:28.718
OH, SWEETIE.

27:28.718 --> 27:31.250
(sighs)

27:31.250 --> 27:33.823
WHAT DID I-I DO?

27:33.823 --> 27:35.825
I-I WRECKED MY MARRIAGE.

27:35.825 --> 27:37.927
LOOK, IT'S GONNA GET BETTER.

27:37.927 --> 27:41.260
I PROMISE YOU
IT'S GONNA GET BETTER.

27:41.260 --> 27:44.694
BUT FOR THAT TO START,

27:44.694 --> 27:46.696
YOU NEED TO GO
TO A MEETING.

27:46.696 --> 27:49.368
I CAN'T GET UP IN FRONT
OF A BUNCH OF STRANGERS

27:49.368 --> 27:51.070
AND TALK ABOUT THIS.

27:51.070 --> 27:55.945
THEN... WE CAN HAVE
A MEETING RIGHT HERE--

27:55.945 --> 27:58.808
JUST THE TWO OF US.

27:58.808 --> 28:00.349
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

28:03.112 --> 28:05.785
(sighs)

28:05.785 --> 28:07.386
(glass clatters)

28:21.300 --> 28:23.773
WOW. WELL, THAT'S GLENN FOR YOU.
HE'S NOTHING IF NOT AGGRESSIVE.

28:23.773 --> 28:26.405
CARLOS, I SWEAR
I DIDN'T SEEK THIS OUT.

28:26.405 --> 28:30.379
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T. AND YOU'RE
A STAND-UP GUY FOR TELLING ME.

28:30.379 --> 28:32.742
BUT IT IS
A VERY GENEROUS OFFER,

28:32.742 --> 28:34.984
AND I FIGURED IF THAT'S
MY VALUE IN THE MARKETPLACE,

28:34.984 --> 28:37.186
THAT MAYBE I SHOULD BE...

28:37.186 --> 28:39.448
DOING A LITTLE BETTER HERE.

28:39.448 --> 28:41.951
(exhales deeply)
LOOK, OUR FRIENDSHIP ASIDE,

28:41.951 --> 28:44.754
YOU ARE A VALUABLE PART
OF THIS COMPANY.

28:44.754 --> 28:46.756
AND IF I HAD THE CASH...

28:46.756 --> 28:48.357
YOU KNOW I'D STEP UP.

28:48.357 --> 28:51.100
BUT...
 YOU HOW ROUGH
THINGS HAVE BEEN.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.802
YOU'VE SEEN THE EMPTY DESKS.

28:52.802 --> 28:54.463
WE JUST CAN'T OFFER YOU
THAT KIND OF MONEY.

28:54.463 --> 28:58.838
BUT I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU,
SO HERE'S WHAT I CAN OFFER--

28:58.838 --> 29:00.840
TITLE BUMP
TO CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER,

29:00.840 --> 29:03.342
CAR ALLOWANCE, AND...

29:03.342 --> 29:05.815
PROFIT PARTICIPATION.

29:05.815 --> 29:06.946
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

29:06.946 --> 29:08.477
IT SOUNDS LIKE A BUNCH OF CRAP.

29:08.477 --> 29:09.979
UGH. LYNETTE.

29:09.979 --> 29:11.450
OF COURSE HE PLEADED POVERTY.
 (bottle cap fizzes, clinks)

29:11.450 --> 29:14.083
DID YOU PLAY HARDBALL?
DID YOU GRIND HIM?

29:14.083 --> 29:17.156
YES! THAT'S HOW I GOT
PROFIT PARTICIPATION.

29:17.156 --> 29:19.989
TOM, I WORKED
AT THAT COMPANY, REMEMBER?

29:19.989 --> 29:22.261
AT THE END OF THE YEAR,
CARLOS TAKES THE EXCESS CASH

29:22.261 --> 29:25.264
AS A BONUS, SO THERE IS
NO PROFIT TO PARTICIPATE IN.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.497
WHAT ELSE DID HE OFFER YOU?
A BOGUS NEW TITLE?

29:28.497 --> 29:31.770
NOT--NOT BOGUS!
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER. C.M.O.

29:33.142 --> 29:35.304
A-AND A CAR ALLOWANCE.

29:35.304 --> 29:36.806
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

29:36.806 --> 29:40.079
"HERE'S YOUR ALLOWANCE, TOMMY.
GOOD LUCK ON YOUR PAPER ROUTE."

29:40.079 --> 29:42.381
YOU ARE OVER THE LINE,
LYNETTE.

29:42.381 --> 29:45.985
AND YOU ARE WALKING AWAY
FROM REAL MONEY AND REAL POWER

29:45.985 --> 29:48.357
FOR PRETEND PROFITS
AND A MADE-UP TITLE.

29:48.357 --> 29:51.991
CARLOS MIGHT AS WELL CALL YOU
"KING OF ALL IMPORTANT THINGS"

29:51.991 --> 29:55.995
AND GIVE YOU A PILE
OF MONOPOLY MONEY.
 WHY DO YOU KEEP
PUSHING LIKE THIS?

29:55.995 --> 29:59.498
'CAUSE IF I DON'T,
YOU GO NOWHERE.
 (clatter)

30:01.500 --> 30:05.374
WOW.

30:05.374 --> 30:07.376
SO THAT'S WHERE
YOU THINK I AM?

30:07.376 --> 30:09.578
(chuckles) NOWHERE?

30:12.411 --> 30:15.414
OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TAKE THAT BACK?

30:15.414 --> 30:20.119
I THINK YOU ARE
AN AMAZING HUSBAND AND FATHER.

30:20.119 --> 30:22.321
BUT AS A BUSINESSMAN...

30:22.321 --> 30:24.523
YOU'RE 46 YEARS OLD

30:24.523 --> 30:26.525
AND YOU'RE STILL TRYING
TO ESTABLISH YOURSELF.

30:26.525 --> 30:29.528
OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS DON'T
KEEP FALLING FROM THE SKY.

30:29.528 --> 30:32.561
YOU GOTTA GRAB 'EM.
 BY STABBING MY FRIEND
IN THE BACK?

30:32.561 --> 30:35.264
DO YOU THINK CARLOS
WOULD HESITATE FOR A SECOND...
 (clatter)

30:35.264 --> 30:37.436
IF THE ROLES WERE REVERSED?
NOT A CHANCE.

30:37.436 --> 30:41.210
THAT'S HOW HE GOT WHERE HE IS.
HE'S RUTHLESS.
 YOU WANNA SEE ME
GET RUTHLESS?

30:41.210 --> 30:45.044
WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU DON'T DROP THIS.

30:51.150 --> 30:54.153
(indistinct conversations,
laughter in distance)

30:57.186 --> 30:59.889
(dance music playing)

30:59.889 --> 31:01.430
(scoffs)

31:01.430 --> 31:04.193
♪♪♪

31:08.597 --> 31:11.600
(indistinct conversations)

31:11.600 --> 31:14.873
♪♪♪

31:19.408 --> 31:22.051
WOW. THIS IS SOME CROWD.

31:22.051 --> 31:24.353
TOLD YA. WELL,
I'M PRETTY CLOSE TO CAPACITY,

31:24.353 --> 31:28.887
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO SCOOT ALONG NOW--
 WELL, I'M JUST STUNNED
SO MANY PEOPLE CAME.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.519
WELL, JUST SHOWS YOU
HOW LITTLE YOU KNOW

31:30.519 --> 31:33.122
ABOUT THE PARTY CIRCUIT ELITE.
 OH.

31:33.122 --> 31:35.124
WAIT. IS THAT THE GUY
FROM ANIMAL CONTROL

31:35.124 --> 31:37.196
WHO PICKS UP DEAD BIRDS?

31:37.196 --> 31:39.368
WHAT? NO.

31:39.368 --> 31:41.670
UH, THESE ARE MOSTLY PEOPLE
I'VE MET THROUGH THE YEARS

31:41.670 --> 31:43.332
IN THE CARIBBEAN.

31:43.332 --> 31:45.404
MRS. SOLIS?
I WAS GOING TO CALL YOU.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.336
IS IT OKAY
IF I CLEAN YOUR POOL

31:47.336 --> 31:49.338
ON THURSDAY
INSTEAD OF WEDNESDAY?

31:49.338 --> 31:52.341
OF COURSE. I MEAN, IF YOU
THINK YOU'LL MAKE IT BACK

31:52.341 --> 31:54.513
FROM ST. BARTS BY THEN.

31:56.245 --> 31:59.448
UGH!
DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.

31:59.448 --> 32:01.420
A GOOD HOSTESS KNOWS
THE BEST PARTIES

32:01.420 --> 32:03.422
HAVE A MIX OF PEOPLE.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.424
HONEY, THE ONLY MIX I SEE

32:05.424 --> 32:09.228
IS THE COTTON/POLY BLEND
ON EVERY DRESS IN THIS ROOM.

32:09.228 --> 32:12.031
EXCUSE ME.

32:12.031 --> 32:15.464
RENEE!

32:15.464 --> 32:17.036
RENEE, LOOK, I--

32:17.036 --> 32:18.337
HEY, YOU TWO!

32:18.337 --> 32:19.708
BEAT IT!

32:19.708 --> 32:21.971
YOU HAVE A COOL HOUSE.

32:21.971 --> 32:24.043
(sighs)

32:24.043 --> 32:26.215
I DON'T GET IT.
WHY HAVE A PARTY

32:26.215 --> 32:29.348
WHEN YOU PEOPLE YOU REALLY WANT
ARE TOO SAD TO COME?

32:29.348 --> 32:32.421
WELL, I'M NOT SAD, AND I'M NOT
GONNA PRETEND TO BE.

32:32.421 --> 32:36.155
RENEE! I KNOW YOU DIDN'T LIKE
BETH, BUT COME ON. SHE'S DYING.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.486
AND WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?

32:37.486 --> 32:40.959
EVERYONE KEEPS ACTING LIKE THIS
HORRIBLE THING HAPPENED TO HER.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.562
IT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN.
SHE DID IT TO HERSELF.

32:43.562 --> 32:46.435
BUT THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH PAIN
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN IN.

32:46.435 --> 32:48.097
EVERYONE HAS PAIN.

32:48.097 --> 32:50.399
BUT ONLY A SELFISH BITCH
CHECKS OUT

32:50.399 --> 32:52.401
AND PASSES IT ON
TO EVERYONE ELSE.

32:52.401 --> 32:54.403
BETH DIDN'T CARE
WHO SHE HURT--

32:54.403 --> 32:59.278
HER MOTHER, HER HUSBAND,
HER DAUGHTER!

32:59.278 --> 33:02.511
SHE DIDN'T HAVE A DAUGHTER.

33:02.511 --> 33:05.014
WELL, AMEN FOR THAT,
AT LEAST.

33:08.387 --> 33:10.389
(clink)

33:10.389 --> 33:16.265
HONEY, YOU TOLD ME YOUR MOM
DIED WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG.

33:16.265 --> 33:17.766
YOU NEVER SAID HOW.

33:17.766 --> 33:19.768
UH-HUH.
 (pouring alcohol)

33:19.768 --> 33:23.372
DID SHE TAKE HER OWN LIFE?

33:26.205 --> 33:28.006
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

33:30.209 --> 33:32.141
(sighs) DAMN IT.

33:32.141 --> 33:36.085
HOW HARD IS IT
TO FILL AN ICE BUCKET?

33:36.085 --> 33:40.489
YOU KNOW, I LOST A PARENT
WHEN I WAS A KID, TOO--MY DAD.

33:40.489 --> 33:43.292
I'M NOT MAKING
COMPARISONS HERE,

33:43.292 --> 33:45.524
AND I UNDERSTAND IF YOU DON'T
WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.696
GOOD, 'CAUSE I DON'T.

33:47.696 --> 33:49.498
BUT I THINK
THAT IF YOU DO...

33:49.498 --> 33:51.200
(bottles rattle)
 DO WHAT?

33:51.200 --> 33:54.463
I'LL FEEL SO MUCH BETTER
IF I LET IT ALL OUT?

33:54.463 --> 33:56.435
WELL, THAT DOESN'T WORK
FOR ME.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.437
I'M NOT A HUG-AND-LEARN
KIND OF GAL.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.139
NO, I GUESS YOU'RE

34:00.139 --> 34:03.172
A THROW-PARTY-AND-FORGET
KIND OF GAL.

34:03.172 --> 34:07.316
LOOK, I WILL NEVER FORGET
WHAT MY MOTHER DID.

34:07.316 --> 34:09.518
I THINK ABOUT IT EVERY DAY.

34:09.518 --> 34:14.822
BUT I REFUSE TO LET IT BE
WHAT DEFINES ME.

34:14.822 --> 34:20.188
THIS SPRING FLING MIGHT SEEM
SHALLOW AND INSENSITIVE TO YOU,

34:20.188 --> 34:24.293
BUT IT'S MY WAY OF SAYING
I CHOOSE LIFE...

34:24.293 --> 34:26.094
OVER DEATH.

34:26.094 --> 34:28.197
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

34:28.197 --> 34:31.139
I'VE GOTTA GET BACK
TO MY LAME-ASS PARTY

34:31.139 --> 34:34.243
WAIT.

34:34.243 --> 34:38.177
IT'S NOT
A LAME-ASS PARTY ANYMORE...

34:38.177 --> 34:39.777
BECAUSE I'M HERE NOW.

34:53.422 --> 34:55.264
0 TO 60 IN UNDER 5 SECONDS,

34:55.264 --> 34:57.266
TOP SPEED OF 160,
AND NO CUP HOLDER...

34:57.266 --> 35:00.329
'CAUSE YOU'LL WANT BOTH HANDS
ON THE WHEEL.

35:00.329 --> 35:02.271
(chuckles) SWEET.

35:02.271 --> 35:03.632
CAN I TAKE IT
FOR A TEST DRIVE?

35:03.632 --> 35:06.135
OH, IT WOULD BE OUR PLEASURE.
 OH!

35:06.135 --> 35:08.607
SO IS THE CAR FOR YOU?
YOUR HUSBAND?

35:08.607 --> 35:10.509
ACTUALLY, NO.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.581
IT'S FOR OUR NEIGHBOR.

35:15.284 --> 35:18.147
(alarm chirps, lock clicks)

35:19.888 --> 35:24.223
HEY, SWEETIE.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.724
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

35:25.724 --> 35:28.227
GUESS WHO'S GOT
A BRAND-NEW SLAP IN THE FACE

35:28.227 --> 35:31.230
PARKED IN FRONT OF HIS HOUSE?
 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

35:31.230 --> 35:35.204
CARLOS. THE DAY AFTER
HE CRIES POOR TO ME,

35:35.204 --> 35:38.307
HE GOES OUT AND BUYS HIMSELF
A $70,000 LOTUS?

35:38.307 --> 35:41.740
I THINK THE EVORA RUNS AROUND
$76,000, BUT WHAT DO I KNOW?

35:41.740 --> 35:45.344
YOU WERE RIGHT, LYNETTE.
I'M A PUSHOVER.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.846
I'M BEING LOYAL TO A GUY
WHO DOES NOTHING

35:47.846 --> 35:49.848
BUT LOOK OUT FOR HIMSELF.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.421
WOW. YOU MUST FEEL
REALLY BETRAYED.

35:52.421 --> 35:54.883
I GOT HALF A MIND
TO CALL GLENN RIGHT NOW

35:54.883 --> 35:56.385
AND TAKE THAT OFFER.

35:56.385 --> 36:00.189
I SAY... USE YOUR WHOLE MIND
AND DO IT.

36:05.334 --> 36:07.496
GLENN?

36:07.496 --> 36:10.539
TOM SCAVO.

36:10.539 --> 36:12.371
I AM IN.

36:12.371 --> 36:14.543
(whispers) YES!

36:14.543 --> 36:16.545
YEAH, YES!
I AM EXCITED, TOO.

36:16.545 --> 36:18.907
WELL, YOU WANNA HAVE
LUNCH TOMORROW

36:18.907 --> 36:21.950
AND HASH OUT THE DETAILS?
I WILL SEE YOU THEN.

36:21.950 --> 36:23.282
FEELS GOOD, HUH?

36:23.282 --> 36:25.284
(exhales deeply)
FEELS REAL GOOD.

36:25.284 --> 36:27.786
(laughs) YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA FEEL EVEN BETTER?

36:27.786 --> 36:30.589
TELLING CARLOS
TO GO SCREW HIMSELF.

36:30.589 --> 36:33.322
NO! WAIT! WAIT!

36:33.322 --> 36:35.794
DON'T TRY AND STOP ME!
I'M GONNA TELL THAT GUY

36:35.794 --> 36:38.967
JUST WHERE HE CAN STICK
HIS EVORA.
 OKAY, BUT BEFORE YOU DO,
IT'S NOT CARLOS'.

36:38.967 --> 36:41.600
AHEM. I BORROWED IT
FROM THE DEALER

36:41.600 --> 36:43.602
AND I PARKED IT THERE.

36:43.602 --> 36:46.435
WHAT?
 I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

36:46.435 --> 36:49.738
IT SOUNDS VERY BAD, BUT I DID IT
FOR A VERY GOOD REASON.

36:49.738 --> 36:52.941
THAT YOU CAN MANIPULATE ME
INTO DOING WHATEVER YOU WANT?
 CARLOS DIDN'T BUY THAT CAR,

36:52.941 --> 36:55.844
BUT HE COULD HAVE WITHOUT EVEN
FEELING IT BECAUSE...

36:55.844 --> 36:57.846
HE'S THE KIND OF GUY

36:57.846 --> 37:00.349
WHO DOESN'T LET
A GOOD OPPORTUNITY GET BY HIM.

37:00.349 --> 37:02.220
MEANWHILE,
YOU'RE HIS DUTIFUL NUMBER TWO,

37:02.220 --> 37:05.454
STARING DOWN THE STREET
AT A CAR YOU WISH YOU HAD.

37:05.454 --> 37:08.927
GET IN. WE'RE TAKING IT BACK,
THEN I'M CALLING GLENN.

37:08.927 --> 37:12.000
JUST ONE--
 GET IN.

37:17.266 --> 37:18.767
(alarm chirps, lock clicks)

37:25.644 --> 37:30.879
TOM, THIS COULD BE YOU--
DRIVING THIS CAR,

37:30.879 --> 37:32.821
LIVING THIS LIFE,

37:32.821 --> 37:36.355
BEING THAT GUY.

37:36.355 --> 37:39.428
I UNDERSTAND IF YOU WANNA
SAY NO TO ALL THAT,

37:39.428 --> 37:41.560
BUT I DON'T EVEN THINK
YOU'VE ASKED YOURSELF,

37:41.560 --> 37:43.292
DO I WANT IT?

37:43.292 --> 37:46.295
IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF YOU DIDN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

37:46.295 --> 37:47.996
(shifts gears)

37:47.996 --> 37:50.969
(engine roars)

37:50.969 --> 37:52.741
WHOA.

37:52.741 --> 37:56.405
(engine revving loudly)

37:58.877 --> 38:00.449
(revving continues)

38:00.449 --> 38:02.751
I CAN'T TELL IF WE
ARE GONNA DRIVE...

38:02.751 --> 38:03.752
(shifts gears)

38:03.752 --> 38:05.314
OR FLY.

38:05.314 --> 38:07.786
(shifts gears)

38:07.786 --> 38:10.789
(revving continues)

38:17.826 --> 38:20.569
(revving continues)

38:32.310 --> 38:36.645
WHAT TIME DOES THIS HAVE
TO BE BACK?

38:36.645 --> 38:39.788
HE SAID 4:00, BUT THEY DON'T
CLOSE TILL 6:00.

38:39.788 --> 38:42.891
I'M GUESSING
WE COULD BE A LITTLE LATE.

38:42.891 --> 38:46.895
YEAH.
LET'S BE A LITTLE LATE.

38:46.895 --> 38:50.899
(engine revving)

38:58.607 --> 39:00.439
HELLO, SUSAN.

39:00.439 --> 39:03.442
WOULD IT BE OKAY
IF I CAME IN FOR A MOMENT?

39:03.442 --> 39:05.844
UH, ACTUALLY, I WAS...

39:07.776 --> 39:11.079
(sighs) SURE.

39:11.079 --> 39:15.023
I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO YOUR APARTMENT.

39:15.023 --> 39:18.827
YEAH, WELL, IT'S NOT MUCH.

39:18.827 --> 39:22.461
NO, IT'S--IT'S QUITE NICE.

39:22.461 --> 39:25.464
I'M ON MY WAY TO THE HOSPITAL
TO SEE BETH...

39:25.464 --> 39:26.935
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

39:26.935 --> 39:28.967
I'VE ALERTED
THE TRANSPLANT OFFICE

39:28.967 --> 39:31.670
THAT WE'LL BE MOVING FORWARD
WITH HER REQUEST.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.672
I'M SURE AS SOON
AS I SIGN THE PAPERS,

39:33.672 --> 39:36.845
THEY'LL BE CONTACTING YOU.

39:36.845 --> 39:38.877
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.079
YOU'RE GETTING
YOUR KIDNEY.

39:41.079 --> 39:43.782
I THOUGHT YOU SAID--

39:43.782 --> 39:45.784
SUSAN...

39:45.784 --> 39:48.857
I WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL
TO YOU IF YOU COULD...

39:48.857 --> 39:51.820
FORGET A LOT OF
THE THINGS THAT I SAID.

39:51.820 --> 39:54.863
YOU WERE RIGHT, PAUL.

39:54.863 --> 39:58.396
I WAS TERRIBLE TO BETH.
I WAS.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.099
I NEVER GAVE HER A CHANCE.

40:01.099 --> 40:04.032
I NEVER TRIED
TO GET TO KNOW HER.

40:04.032 --> 40:08.707
WHY WOULD SHE DO THIS
FOR ME

40:08.707 --> 40:12.180
WHEN I DID NOTHING
TO DESERVE IT?

40:12.180 --> 40:15.844
BETH DIDN'T LOVE PEOPLE
BECAUSE THEY DESERVED IT.

40:15.844 --> 40:19.588
BELIEVE ME. I KNOW THAT.

40:19.588 --> 40:22.090
I'M SO CONFUSED. I...

40:22.090 --> 40:24.793
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN ACCEPT.

40:24.793 --> 40:26.855
PLEASE... HONOR BETH'S LIFE

40:26.855 --> 40:29.628
BY ALLOWING HER
TO MAKE YOU WELL,

40:29.628 --> 40:31.730
FOR YOUR SON...

40:31.730 --> 40:34.162
FOR YOUR FAMILY...

40:34.162 --> 40:35.734
FOR YOUR FRIENDS.

40:37.706 --> 40:39.007
(sighs)

40:41.740 --> 40:43.712
OKAY.

40:43.712 --> 40:47.676
THANK YOU.

40:47.676 --> 40:48.677
PAUL...

40:48.677 --> 40:50.148
YES?

40:53.822 --> 40:58.156
I AM SO...

40:58.156 --> 41:02.661
VERY, VERY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR WIFE.

41:02.661 --> 41:06.595
YES.

41:06.595 --> 41:08.737
(voice breaking)
I AM, TOO.

41:12.140 --> 41:15.143
(crying)

41:20.248 --> 41:25.654
THERE COMES A MOMENT WHEN
OUR LIVES CHANGE FOREVER...

41:25.654 --> 41:31.690
THE MOMENT WE ADMIT
OUR WEAKNESSES...

41:31.690 --> 41:37.526
THE MOMENT WE RISE
TO A CHALLENGE...

41:37.526 --> 41:43.271
THE MOMENT WE ACCEPT
A SACRIFICE...

41:45.604 --> 41:49.638
OR LET A LOVED ONE GO.

41:52.541 --> 41:55.213
AND SOMETIMES...

41:55.213 --> 41:59.217
THE CHANGE IN OUR LIVES...

41:59.217 --> 42:02.190
IS AN ANSWER TO OUR PRAYERS.

42:02.190 --> 42:04.723
MS. TILLMAN?

42:04.723 --> 42:08.126
THOUGHT I'D FIND YOU HERE.
SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

42:08.126 --> 42:10.659
THANK YOU, WARDEN.

42:10.659 --> 42:13.261
I'M SURE THIS IS
SMALL CONSOLATION,

42:13.261 --> 42:15.303
BUT I'VE JUST HEARD
FROM THE PAROLE BOARD.

42:15.303 --> 42:17.305
THEY'VE DECIDED
TO GRANT YOUR REQUEST

42:17.305 --> 42:19.708
FOR HUMANITARIAN RELEASE.

42:19.708 --> 42:22.711
(sighs) IRONIC, ISN'T IT?

42:22.711 --> 42:26.014
MY DAUGHTER HAD TO DIE
SO I COULD GO FREE.

42:26.014 --> 42:29.247
AGAIN, MY CONDOLENCES.

42:31.219 --> 42:33.582
(buzzer sounds)
