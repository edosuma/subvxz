Tonight on Total Divas...

00:08.509 --> 00:09.510
Party time.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.777
Tahoe!

00:13.146 --> 00:14.314
I really want this

00:14.314 --> 00:15.749
to be very much a bonding trip

00:15.749 --> 00:17.117
for all of us girls.

00:17.117 --> 00:18.819
Just live in the moment here.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.087
want, Lana.

00:21.087 --> 00:21.922
You okay, sweetie?

00:21.922 --> 00:22.723
Why can't people just

00:22.723 --> 00:23.624
leave me alone?

00:23.624 --> 00:24.625
What the hell happened?

00:25.626 --> 00:26.426
What? Oh, my God.

00:30.296 --> 00:30.964
Atlanta for?

00:30.964 --> 00:31.965

00:33.700 --> 00:34.535
Atlanta, that's what you want.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.335
That's not true.

been chaotic and confusing and I

need to get away somewhere that

one place you can do that.

childhood.

tradition that we do to this

day.

had fun.

bonding week.

03:31.698 --> 03:33.299
In Lake Tahoe!

03:33.299 --> 03:34.467
Usually, us girls like to go

03:34.467 --> 03:36.503
somewhere where we can get

03:36.503 --> 03:38.805
crazy, but this trip to Tahoe

03:38.805 --> 03:40.607
will be different from Miami

03:40.607 --> 03:41.808
because it's gonna be, like,

03:41.808 --> 03:43.476
camp feel where it's almost

03:43.476 --> 03:45.712
like, Kumbaya, and we're all

03:45.712 --> 03:46.713
gonna bond.

03:46.713 --> 03:48.114

03:48.114 --> 03:48.915
this.

03:49.683 --> 03:50.450
rooms.

Let's go have a tour.

03:51.351 --> 03:52.052
Should we just walk

03:52.052 --> 03:52.819
upstairs?

03:52.819 --> 03:53.486
Yeah.

03:53.486 --> 03:54.921
Sorry, bitches!

03:54.921 --> 03:55.922
Whoa.

03:55.922 --> 03:56.890
But we always get the

03:56.890 --> 03:57.558
best room.

03:57.558 --> 03:58.258
Paige and Nia might

03:58.258 --> 03:58.925
like to share.

03:58.925 --> 03:59.626
Paige and Nia will

03:59.626 --> 04:00.567
love sharing.

04:00.567 --> 04:01.568
They're best friends.

04:01.568 --> 04:02.569
Upstairs, there's two

04:02.569 --> 04:03.904
large master bedrooms.

04:03.904 --> 04:04.905
Perfect for the girls who are

04:04.905 --> 04:06.072
sharing a bed.

04:06.072 --> 04:09.275
Yay, look how pretty.

04:09.275 --> 04:10.611
This is what I want.

This is the room I want.

04:11.812 --> 04:12.813
This is Lana.

04:12.813 --> 04:13.847
This room is Lana.

04:13.847 --> 04:14.681
Yeah, this is Lana.

04:14.681 --> 04:15.716
And look at.

04:15.716 --> 04:17.117
Lana has a bar and a Jacuzzi.

04:17.117 --> 04:18.151
Yeah.

04:18.151 --> 04:19.185
What's this?

04:19.185 --> 04:20.185
Oh, wait, is that the

04:20.185 --> 04:21.187
other beds?

04:21.187 --> 04:22.188
This is another bed,

04:22.188 --> 04:23.156
though.

04:23.156 --> 04:24.157
Really quick, we are

04:24.157 --> 04:26.026
telling Lana this is her bed.

04:27.060 --> 04:28.261
We have to prank Lana.

04:28.261 --> 04:29.395
Lana will love this.

04:29.395 --> 04:30.430
So, apparently, Lana

04:30.430 --> 04:31.632
always feels that she gets the

04:31.632 --> 04:32.633
worst room.

04:32.633 --> 04:33.633
Lana is not staying

04:33.633 --> 04:34.634
on this floor.

04:34.634 --> 04:35.401
Did you move my stuff?

04:35.401 --> 04:36.135
My, actually, my backpack and my

04:36.135 --> 04:36.803
mirror is upstairs.

04:36.803 --> 04:37.470

04:42.275 --> 04:44.210
I always get the bad room.

04:44.210 --> 04:45.278
I thought it'd be funny

04:45.278 --> 04:47.247
to tell Lana that she has to

04:47.247 --> 04:49.082
sleep on the pullout bed, but

04:49.082 --> 04:50.584
actually, she has this really

04:50.584 --> 04:51.985
nice room with a lake view.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.301
and I'm like... ...like

that and then he's like, "Lo..."

weight, Paige."

everyone's always on about me

05:45.512 --> 05:46.513
about my weight.

12:03.203 --> 12:03.870
straight in the face.

12:03.870 --> 12:04.538
Come, punch me.

12:04.538 --> 12:05.205
Paige, don't.

12:05.205 --> 12:05.872
I got her.

12:05.872 --> 12:06.640
Don't punch her in the face.

12:06.640 --> 12:07.373
Seriously, she's

12:07.373 --> 12:08.074
making me livid right

12:08.074 --> 12:08.742
now.

12:08.742 --> 12:09.576
Yeah, no, I can tell.

12:09.576 --> 12:10.476
Let me talk to Lana.

12:10.476 --> 12:11.244
What the hell happened?

12:11.244 --> 12:12.278
She's being a

12:12.278 --> 12:13.179
brat.

12:13.179 --> 12:14.180
Didn't we just get here?

12:14.180 --> 12:15.015
I can tell Paige is getting

12:15.015 --> 12:16.016
really angry.

12:16.016 --> 12:18.118
And Lana is just not quitting

12:18.118 --> 12:19.520
and she's just poking and poking

12:19.520 --> 12:20.687
and, I don't think a lot of the

12:20.687 --> 12:21.622
girls know.

12:21.622 --> 12:23.356
Like, Paige and Lana don't

12:23.356 --> 12:25.191
always get along.

12:25.191 --> 12:26.392
Because I know Paige has a lot

12:26.392 --> 12:27.961
of pent‐up anger towards Lana.

12:27.961 --> 12:30.030
So I don't think this is gonna

12:30.030 --> 12:31.131
go anywhere good.

12:31.131 --> 12:32.733
This is why I never

12:32.733 --> 12:33.399
liked you, Lana.

12:33.399 --> 12:34.868
Because you're such a brat all

12:34.868 --> 12:35.536
the time.

12:35.536 --> 12:37.237
It's just a bedroom.

12:37.237 --> 12:38.605
You're gonna sleep in there for

12:38.605 --> 12:39.706
maybe four hours.

12:39.706 --> 12:40.440
You're the biggest

12:40.440 --> 12:41.441
brat, too.

12:41.441 --> 12:42.475
We're all gonna be

12:42.475 --> 12:43.376
together having fun, don't‐‐

12:43.376 --> 12:44.310
let's not ruin the vibe.

12:44.310 --> 12:45.278
I'm leaving.

12:45.278 --> 12:46.680
I'm not gonna s‐spend time with

12:46.680 --> 12:47.614
someone like that.

12:47.614 --> 12:48.314
that.

12:48.314 --> 12:49.049
What's happening?

12:49.049 --> 12:50.383
Lana won't leave her

12:50.383 --> 12:51.518
room.

12:51.518 --> 12:52.385
So I was like, "All

12:52.385 --> 12:53.219
right, I'll stay in this..."

12:53.219 --> 12:54.420
Sh‐she was, like, legit saying,

12:54.420 --> 12:55.155
"I will leave this house

12:55.155 --> 12:55.822
right now."

12:55.822 --> 12:56.657
I was like, "Then do it."

12:56.657 --> 12:58.024
I'm not gonna lie, I'm

12:58.024 --> 12:59.660
really shocked that this is

12:59.660 --> 13:00.967
happening over a room.

13:00.967 --> 13:02.368
It's just crazy, I never

13:02.368 --> 13:03.203
expected this.

13:03.203 --> 13:04.470
I wanted all of us to be

13:04.470 --> 13:07.608
together, to just, like, bond.

13:07.608 --> 13:09.109
But now I'm just like, "No, this

13:09.109 --> 13:10.877
is not the trip I wanted."

13:10.877 --> 13:12.212
If you feel that way,

13:12.212 --> 13:13.379
be the bigger person and go,

13:13.379 --> 13:14.815
"You know what, like, I'll stay

13:14.815 --> 13:15.716
in the basement, the twins are

13:15.716 --> 13:16.382
so excited to have us here."

13:16.382 --> 13:17.183
I will, absolutely will

13:17.183 --> 13:18.184
not do that.

13:18.184 --> 13:19.419
I‐‐ that I will not do.

13:19.419 --> 13:20.220
After the that she just

13:20.220 --> 13:20.887
said to me?

13:20.887 --> 13:21.588
To me, I'm just

13:21.588 --> 13:22.255
happy...

13:22.255 --> 13:23.156
I will 100% not do

13:23.156 --> 13:23.824
that.

13:23.824 --> 13:25.325
She just said I'm a bitch

13:25.325 --> 13:26.827
because she doesn't get the room

13:26.827 --> 13:28.028
that she wanted.

13:28.028 --> 13:29.095
Calm down.

13:29.095 --> 13:30.063
I can

13:30.063 --> 13:31.932
feel myself being a brat because

13:31.932 --> 13:33.266
I'm not getting my way.

13:33.266 --> 13:35.301
But the more she yells at me,

13:35.301 --> 13:37.337
the more I refuse to give in.

13:37.337 --> 13:39.773
The more I refuse get up.

13:39.773 --> 13:42.408
Because who is she to say to me

13:42.408 --> 13:43.510
what I'm supposed to do?

13:43.510 --> 13:45.178
I'm just like her, I'm as

13:45.178 --> 13:46.046
stubborn as her.

13:46.046 --> 13:46.847
I don't give a

13:46.847 --> 13:47.914
where I stay as long as

13:47.914 --> 13:48.782
I'm with my friends.

13:48.782 --> 13:49.783
So, I...

13:49.783 --> 13:50.751
Well, I just found out

13:50.751 --> 13:51.752
that Paige never liked me, so

13:51.752 --> 13:52.786
she's not my friend, so I don't

13:52.786 --> 13:53.620
want to be around her.

13:53.620 --> 13:54.655
I just want us to be

13:54.655 --> 13:55.722
able to spend time together.

13:55.722 --> 13:56.757
Let it go.

13:58.024 --> 13:59.292
What's the matter?

13:59.292 --> 14:01.167
So, we get here and

14:01.167 --> 14:02.669
they put me in the basement,

14:02.669 --> 14:03.904
again.

14:03.904 --> 14:05.305
And then Paige, can be in, like,

14:05.305 --> 14:06.039
this really nice room.

14:06.039 --> 14:08.208
And I'm like, well, um, I'm

14:08.208 --> 14:10.511
like, "I'll share a room with

14:10.511 --> 14:11.377
someone," then Paige is like,

14:11.377 --> 14:12.178
"Well, I don't want to share a

14:12.178 --> 14:12.846
room with you."

14:12.846 --> 14:14.715
And then, like, Nia's trying‐‐

14:14.715 --> 14:16.216
and then, I was like‐‐ and I

14:16.216 --> 14:17.183
told Paige, I was like, "No,

14:17.183 --> 14:18.051
you're a frickin' bitch."

14:18.051 --> 14:19.119
Like, I said I would share a

14:19.119 --> 14:20.020
room with you," and she was

14:20.020 --> 14:21.187
like, "I don't want to share

14:21.187 --> 14:22.422
a room with you, I want to share

14:22.422 --> 14:23.389
a room with Nia."

14:23.389 --> 14:25.559
And, um, she's like, "I'm gonna

14:25.559 --> 14:26.359
punch you in the face."

14:26.359 --> 14:27.227
And I'm like, "Okay,

14:27.227 --> 14:28.428
come punch me in the face."

14:28.428 --> 14:30.130
Okay, then why are

14:30.130 --> 14:33.900
you still there?

14:33.900 --> 14:34.968
At first, I thought

14:34.968 --> 14:35.636
she was joking.

14:35.636 --> 14:36.603
And then I realized that she

14:36.603 --> 14:38.572
wasn't joking and I'm like‐‐ I

14:38.572 --> 14:39.405
think of when I always would

14:39.405 --> 14:40.073
stay here.

14:40.073 --> 14:41.074
And I never had, like, a

14:41.074 --> 14:42.475

14:42.475 --> 14:43.710

14:43.710 --> 14:46.212
see this incredible lake?

14:46.212 --> 14:47.447
It's just very ungrateful to me,

treated me.

16:42.242 --> 16:43.176
But I think it's

16:43.176 --> 16:44.377
because her and Nia were so

16:44.377 --> 16:46.179
excited to share a room and have

that room.

that room.

16:50.116 --> 16:51.618
I feel like I'm kind of the one

16:51.618 --> 16:53.186
who started all this because I

16:53.186 --> 16:54.888
just wanted to play a simple

16:54.888 --> 16:55.556
prank.

amazing weekend for a room you

17:01.502 --> 17:02.603
don't like.

17:02.603 --> 17:03.403
I was literally laying

17:03.403 --> 17:04.570
in the bed, but I did say, that

17:04.570 --> 17:05.939
like, I'll share the room with

17:05.939 --> 17:06.607
someone.

17:06.607 --> 17:07.440
Then you said, that I‐‐

17:07.440 --> 17:08.241
you didn't want to share the

17:08.241 --> 17:08.909
room with me.

17:08.909 --> 17:09.710
I already said that

17:09.710 --> 17:10.376
from the beginning.

17:10.376 --> 17:11.243
I was like, "Me and Nia are

17:11.243 --> 17:11.912
gonna share.

17:11.912 --> 17:12.878
If she doesn't, then we're gonna

17:12.878 --> 17:14.079
go in the single room."

17:14.079 --> 17:15.115
But me and Nia were gonna share.

17:15.115 --> 17:16.016
That's why they gave us the

17:16.016 --> 17:16.916
room.

17:16.916 --> 17:17.917
You just went up there and

17:17.917 --> 17:19.419
was like "I'm not leaving."

17:19.419 --> 17:20.721
No, you were a brat, Lana.

17:20.721 --> 17:21.622
You weren't polite, you weren't

17:21.622 --> 17:22.888
nice, you're being a douchebag.

17:22.888 --> 17:23.890
And that's what pissed me off.

17:23.890 --> 17:24.758
If not, I would've been nice to

could‐‐ I was probably acting

There was no need for

17:28.361 --> 17:29.029
it.

17:29.029 --> 17:29.930
But the fact that you,

17:29.930 --> 17:31.131

bad.

17:32.165 --> 17:33.199

17:33.199 --> 17:34.034
ruined the whole

17:34.034 --> 17:35.068
vacation because you didn't want

17:35.068 --> 17:36.102
to take your ass into a nice

17:36.102 --> 17:36.903
beautiful double room with a

17:36.903 --> 17:37.571
view.

17:37.571 --> 17:38.572
You said that

17:38.572 --> 17:39.740
you hate me up there.

17:39.740 --> 17:40.574
Yeah, you know what?

17:40.574 --> 17:41.274
You literally go...

17:41.274 --> 17:41.975
This is why I've

17:41.975 --> 17:42.843
always hated you, but that's the

17:42.843 --> 17:43.510
thing...

17:43.510 --> 17:44.210
She just

17:44.210 --> 17:44.878
said it.

17:44.878 --> 17:45.679
What? I'm‐‐ you want

17:45.679 --> 17:46.847
me to be honest, or you want me

17:46.847 --> 17:49.115
to say that I like you?

17:49.115 --> 17:50.483
I've always hated you,

17:50.483 --> 17:51.351
Lana, because it all stemmed

17:51.351 --> 17:52.052
from your tweet.

17:52.052 --> 17:53.053
Ever since then,

17:53.053 --> 17:53.954
I haven't been good with you.

17:53.954 --> 17:55.021
Paige brings up this

17:55.021 --> 17:56.623
tweet that happened three years

17:56.623 --> 17:59.860
ago and I am stunned that she's

17:59.860 --> 18:02.002
hated me for three years.

18:02.002 --> 18:03.837
I posted that tweet because at

18:03.837 --> 18:05.305
the time, Paige was playing a

18:05.305 --> 18:07.373
really mean bad guy on TV.

18:07.373 --> 18:09.543
But there was truth in it.

18:09.543 --> 18:11.512
I felt I was very mistreated and

18:11.512 --> 18:14.180
yelled at by Paige often when

18:14.180 --> 18:16.416
I came into WWE.

18:16.416 --> 18:17.518
I barely said one

18:17.518 --> 18:18.552
thing on the‐‐ on the Internet.

18:18.552 --> 18:19.419
Lana tweeted that I was really

18:19.419 --> 18:20.687
mean to her, but I never really

18:20.687 --> 18:22.789
spoke to her, so I didn't even

18:22.789 --> 18:23.990
know where she got that from.

18:23.990 --> 18:24.891
And it was so ridiculous because

18:24.891 --> 18:25.926
all she wanted was like, "Oh, I

18:25.926 --> 18:26.793
was just trying to get a

18:26.793 --> 18:27.961
storyline in WWE, maybe we can

18:27.961 --> 18:28.795
have a match together."

18:28.795 --> 18:29.763
I'm like, "No bitch, you tell me

18:29.763 --> 18:31.264
about it, before you go on the

18:31.264 --> 18:32.933
Internet and try and frickin'

18:32.933 --> 18:35.368
on me and my name."

18:35.368 --> 18:36.537
Like, unfortunately, like, that

18:36.537 --> 18:38.004
hurt me and after that, I just

18:38.004 --> 18:38.972
couldn't be on the same page

18:38.972 --> 18:39.640
with her.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.274
I've been trying my hardest to

18:41.274 --> 18:42.776
be nice to you, I really have.

18:42.776 --> 18:44.044
I've just got to a point in my

18:44.044 --> 18:45.512
life, where I've taken enough

18:45.512 --> 18:47.614
crap from people and I will not

18:47.614 --> 18:49.449
take any more.

18:49.449 --> 18:50.316
This you pull sometimes,

18:50.316 --> 18:51.117
like this, I'm like, "this is

18:51.117 --> 18:51.918
exactly why I don't like

18:51.918 --> 18:52.586
her."

18:52.586 --> 18:53.419
And that's exactly why

18:53.419 --> 18:54.254
I don't like you.

18:54.254 --> 18:55.021
What are you gonna do

18:55.021 --> 18:55.689
about it, bitch?

18:55.689 --> 18:56.523
Because of the way...

18:56.523 --> 18:57.257
The way you treat me.

18:57.257 --> 18:57.924
Oh, really?

18:57.924 --> 18:58.925
What are you gonna do about it,

18:58.925 --> 19:01.001
bitch?

19:05.438 --> 19:06.439
More than ever, we

19:06.439 --> 19:07.774
need to bond with each other and

19:07.774 --> 19:09.242
just have fun.

19:09.242 --> 19:10.544
Be the bigger person.

19:10.544 --> 19:11.211
Be it.

19:11.211 --> 19:12.145
I always do that with

19:12.145 --> 19:12.813
her.

19:12.813 --> 19:14.515
You just get to a point

19:14.515 --> 19:15.816
where enough is enough and you

19:15.816 --> 19:18.018
boil up and then you explode.

19:22.689 --> 19:23.790
The you pull

19:23.790 --> 19:24.625
sometimes, like this, I'm like,

19:24.625 --> 19:25.391
"This is exactly why I don't

19:25.391 --> 19:26.059
like her."

19:26.059 --> 19:26.893
And that's exactly why

19:26.893 --> 19:27.728
I don't like you.

19:27.728 --> 19:28.461
What are you gonna do

19:28.461 --> 19:29.129
about it, bitch?

19:29.129 --> 19:29.863
Because of the way you

19:29.863 --> 19:30.531
snap...

19:30.531 --> 19:31.397
What are you gonna do

19:31.397 --> 19:32.065
about it, bitch?

19:32.065 --> 19:32.899
I'm not gonna hit you.

19:32.899 --> 19:33.900
Do what? Do what?

19:33.900 --> 19:37.571
Come on, come on, spit it out.

19:37.571 --> 19:38.371
So please, spit it out.

19:38.371 --> 19:39.272
I'm not gonna hit you.

19:39.272 --> 19:40.140
What are you gonna do

19:40.140 --> 19:40.807
about it, bitch?

19:40.807 --> 19:41.642
What? I'm not gonna be

19:41.642 --> 19:45.378
a doormat.

19:45.378 --> 19:46.212
What do you mean,

19:46.212 --> 19:47.280
you're never a doormat,

19:47.280 --> 19:48.014
Lana.

19:48.014 --> 19:49.750
You're never a doormat.

19:49.750 --> 19:50.751
What are you talking about?

19:50.751 --> 19:51.618
Lana, settle down.

19:51.618 --> 19:52.619
Let's have a good night.

19:52.619 --> 19:53.453
When have you ever

19:53.453 --> 19:54.521
been a doormat?

19:54.521 --> 19:55.689
You get whatever you

19:55.689 --> 19:56.456
want, Lana.

19:56.456 --> 19:57.390
To be fair, she just,

19:57.390 --> 19:58.324
like, she's had that on her

19:58.324 --> 19:59.993
chest for a while, so she wanted

19:59.993 --> 20:03.236
to let that out.

20:03.236 --> 20:04.204
Seriously, I'm done

20:04.204 --> 20:06.272
with this.

20:06.272 --> 20:07.874
I totally understand

20:07.874 --> 20:09.409
where Paige is coming from.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.844
I think us giving her this

20:10.844 --> 20:11.945
amazing room, like, it made

20:11.945 --> 20:13.379
Paige feel special and something

20:13.379 --> 20:14.380
that she hasn't felt in a long

20:14.380 --> 20:15.181
time.

20:15.181 --> 20:16.282
And I think Lana taking that

20:16.282 --> 20:17.918
away from her, that's what made

20:17.918 --> 20:20.654
her hit this snapping point.

20:20.654 --> 20:22.188
And when I look at Lana's

20:22.188 --> 20:23.489
issues, I get where Lana always

20:23.489 --> 20:25.158
feels like the last one picked

20:25.158 --> 20:26.326
or the one left out.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.528
And then that makes me feel bad.

20:27.528 --> 20:29.362
You just get to a point where

20:29.362 --> 20:30.731
enough is enough and you're

20:30.731 --> 20:32.065
just, you boil up and then you

20:32.065 --> 20:32.733
explode.

20:32.733 --> 20:33.634
I'm not letting people

20:33.634 --> 20:34.500
treat me like dog , I'm

20:34.500 --> 20:35.168
over it.

20:35.168 --> 20:35.836
Yeah.

20:35.836 --> 20:36.703
And if I get angry,

20:36.703 --> 20:38.672
that's because I year

20:38.672 --> 20:39.573
and a half of just being

20:39.573 --> 20:41.041
degraded and pushed

20:41.041 --> 20:41.742
around.

20:41.742 --> 20:43.844
I'm constantly.

20:43.844 --> 20:44.745
So she can just go

20:44.745 --> 20:45.411
herself.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.412
I'm done with people

20:46.412 --> 20:47.848
talking to me like that.

20:47.848 --> 20:50.517
treated me like.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.586
Yeah.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.723
This is my thing.

20:56.723 --> 20:57.724
I think you're not upset about

20:57.724 --> 20:59.092
the room, I think you're upset

20:59.092 --> 21:00.100
that Paige said that she hated

21:00.100 --> 21:00.834
you.

21:00.834 --> 21:02.402
Yeah, of course.

21:02.402 --> 21:04.538
We are a sisterhood.

21:04.538 --> 21:06.272
And we always have each other's

21:06.272 --> 21:07.407
backs.

21:07.407 --> 21:10.276
I love Lana, and I care a lot

21:10.276 --> 21:11.444
about Lana and I can see that

21:11.444 --> 21:12.579
Lana was hurting.

21:12.579 --> 21:13.580
I think everything that Paige

21:13.580 --> 21:14.681
has gone through over the last

21:14.681 --> 21:15.882
year, it's almost like it's all

21:15.882 --> 21:17.317
coming out right now and it's

21:17.317 --> 21:18.484
being, like, channeled into this

21:18.484 --> 21:19.686
fight with Lana.

21:19.686 --> 21:21.387
And, you know, Paige can be a

21:21.387 --> 21:22.523
little blunt and she can be a

21:22.523 --> 21:23.524
a little aggressive.

21:23.524 --> 21:24.625
Lana can be a little dramatic

21:24.625 --> 21:25.626
and a little sensitive.

21:25.626 --> 21:26.426
They just seem to be

21:26.426 --> 21:27.427
overreacting and this isn't

21:27.427 --> 21:28.394
really them.

21:28.394 --> 21:29.395
This isn't who they are.

21:29.395 --> 21:30.230
Why don't you go up to Paige and

21:30.230 --> 21:30.997
and go, "You know what? I know

21:30.997 --> 21:31.865
you hate my guts, but I want to

21:31.865 --> 21:32.599
"have... I want to put this

21:32.599 --> 21:33.433
behind us."

21:33.433 --> 21:34.367
Be the bigger person.

21:34.367 --> 21:35.401
Be it, be it.

21:35.401 --> 21:37.037
I always do that with

21:37.037 --> 21:38.038
her.

21:38.038 --> 21:38.739
You drive me crazy.

21:38.739 --> 21:39.573
I drive you crazy.

21:39.573 --> 21:40.507
Paige drives you crazy.

21:40.507 --> 21:41.542
You drive Paige crazy.

21:41.542 --> 21:42.475
Let's move on.

21:42.475 --> 21:43.443
We all love each other.

21:43.443 --> 21:44.444
Sisters fight.

21:44.444 --> 21:45.746
I have seen Nicole and Brie have

21:45.746 --> 21:47.047
fights with each other where

21:47.047 --> 21:48.048
they're literally at each

21:48.048 --> 21:49.082
other's throat.

21:49.082 --> 21:52.118
We have to move past it.

Like, legit losing my on

22:11.945 --> 22:13.213
her because, like, she's just

22:13.213 --> 22:14.280
like laying on the bed and I'm

22:14.280 --> 22:15.281
like "What are you doing?"

22:15.281 --> 22:16.482
And then she was like, "I'm not

22:16.482 --> 22:17.784
moving."

22:17.784 --> 22:18.785
Babe, I was literally ready to

22:18.785 --> 22:19.786
lynch her.

22:19.786 --> 22:20.987
I was like...

22:20.987 --> 22:22.222
I guess... huh?

22:22.222 --> 22:23.256
Dude, you're arguing

22:23.256 --> 22:24.290
over a room?

22:24.290 --> 22:25.225
What?

22:25.225 --> 22:25.926
Make up with her and

22:25.926 --> 22:26.827
move on.

22:26.827 --> 22:27.561
Should I go over there

22:27.561 --> 22:28.294
and be the bigger person right

22:28.294 --> 22:28.962
now?

22:28.962 --> 22:29.996
Yes, you're there to

22:29.996 --> 22:32.666
party, not fight over a bedroom.

22:32.666 --> 22:34.134
My boyfriend, Kalan,

22:34.134 --> 22:35.536
is talking to me, and, like,

22:35.536 --> 22:36.670
it's making me feel bad.

22:36.670 --> 22:38.505
So, yeah, I just feel like‐‐ I'm

22:38.505 --> 22:39.506
just gonna take it on the chin.

22:39.506 --> 22:40.507
I'm gonna apologize 'cause I

22:40.507 --> 22:41.508
don't want to work with someone,

22:41.508 --> 22:42.509
I don't want to hang out with

22:42.509 --> 22:43.544
someone where you have that

22:43.544 --> 22:44.578
constant drama all the time.

22:44.578 --> 22:45.912
And I kind of just exploded on

22:45.912 --> 22:46.913
her, maybe a little bit too

22:46.913 --> 22:47.914
much.

22:47.914 --> 22:49.950
So, I feel like me and Lana need

22:49.950 --> 22:51.384
to get our together.

22:51.384 --> 22:53.419
I'm at a stage in my life right

22:53.419 --> 22:55.021
now where I can't be fake to

22:55.021 --> 22:56.022
people.

22:56.022 --> 22:57.023
And I'm sorry if I lost it on

22:57.023 --> 22:58.024
you.

22:58.024 --> 23:00.466
And I don't want any more

23:00.466 --> 23:01.467
tension.

23:01.467 --> 23:02.603
I don't want you to leave.

23:02.603 --> 23:03.637
It's just, it's not

23:03.637 --> 23:04.738
even about the room anymore.

23:04.738 --> 23:05.739
It's just, like, every...

23:05.739 --> 23:06.740
Like, I know I can be a brat.

23:06.740 --> 23:07.741
Like, I know that.

23:07.741 --> 23:08.975
I know why you got...

23:08.975 --> 23:10.076
Like, me sitting there, and,

23:10.076 --> 23:11.077
like, I know.

23:11.077 --> 23:12.245
And I just can get stubborn,

23:12.245 --> 23:13.246
I was just sitting there.

23:13.246 --> 23:14.915
But it's... it was just

23:14.915 --> 23:15.916
everything that happened after

23:15.916 --> 23:17.450
that got me really upset, and

35:29.696 --> 35:30.697
week off.

35:30.697 --> 35:31.698
I agree.

35:31.698 --> 35:32.533
'Cause I feel like,

35:32.533 --> 35:33.366
when you're in Lake Tahoe, like,

35:33.366 --> 35:34.701
it's a true bonding moment, and

35:34.701 --> 35:36.402
I think for the women, like,

35:36.402 --> 35:37.738
there's always so much talk

35:37.738 --> 35:38.672
about, we have this revolution

35:38.672 --> 35:42.008
going on, but, like, revolutions

35:42.008 --> 35:43.810
start outside of the ring.

35:43.810 --> 35:44.811
I know I'm very

35:44.811 --> 35:45.812
connected with all the girls.

35:45.812 --> 35:46.813
I have a very strong bond with

35:46.813 --> 35:47.814
them.

35:47.814 --> 35:49.115
I feel like you are the same.

35:49.115 --> 35:50.416
We just...

35:50.416 --> 35:51.552
Obviously, it's Lana and Paige

35:51.552 --> 35:52.719
who don't, and we saw that

35:52.719 --> 35:53.720
unravel last night.

35:53.720 --> 35:54.721
Lana and Paige

35:54.721 --> 35:55.856
definitely have issues that they

35:55.856 --> 35:56.957
need to figure out.

35:56.957 --> 35:57.791
They've had issues in the past,

35:57.791 --> 35:58.892
and I don't think they actually

35:58.892 --> 36:00.466
ever have sat and talked it out.

36:00.466 --> 36:03.336
So, ironically, Tahoe is, like,

36:03.336 --> 36:04.404
so perfect for these two right

36:04.404 --> 36:05.539
now.

36:05.539 --> 36:06.540
You know what I would love?

36:06.540 --> 36:08.509
I would love Lana and Paige to

36:08.509 --> 36:09.710
work through whatever issues

36:09.710 --> 36:11.344
they have so they can actually

36:11.344 --> 36:13.179
leave Tahoe and not only respect

36:13.179 --> 36:14.014
each other, but maybe actually

36:14.014 --> 36:15.015
like each other.

36:15.015 --> 36:15.849
And they might get into

36:15.849 --> 36:16.683
another fight about it, but at

36:16.683 --> 36:18.218
least they'll... they can try to

36:18.218 --> 36:20.220

Yeah, they have man

She shed, babe cave.

Ooh. The butt hut.

Ew!

No, that's terrible.

Yes, ma'am.

37:10.977 --> 37:12.211
I love these floors.

Thank you.

37:13.212 --> 37:14.213

37:14.213 --> 37:17.350
started out, it was 21 and 23.

37:17.350 --> 37:18.384
Check that out.

37:18.384 --> 37:19.953
A nice spot.

really need at this point in our

37:27.761 --> 37:28.629
life from each other.

Oh, this is a nice‐sized

37:29.630 --> 37:30.631
bedroom.

37:30.631 --> 37:32.398
That's gonna continue to change

37:32.398 --> 37:33.934
and evolve as we go through

37:33.934 --> 37:34.935
life together and as we get

37:34.935 --> 37:35.936
older.

37:35.936 --> 37:36.937
Well, thank you.

37:36.937 --> 37:37.871
You're very welcome.

Yeah.

37:50.316 --> 37:51.718
Yeah.

37:51.718 --> 37:52.986
This is definitely something I

37:52.986 --> 37:54.855
want to do for sure now.

realization of this actually

38:01.234 --> 38:02.235
being a possibility...

38:02.235 --> 38:03.236
Yeah.

41:45.045 --> 41:46.046
You over here talking about

41:46.046 --> 41:47.347
Atlanta, I'm up.

41:47.347 --> 41:48.515
I'm doing this at work, and I

41:48.515 --> 41:49.516
don't even know what‐what...

41:49.516 --> 41:50.383
We're always at

41:50.383 --> 41:51.384
work.

41:51.384 --> 41:52.218
When‐when else are we gonna talk

41:52.218 --> 41:53.219
about it?

41:53.219 --> 41:54.120
I try to talk to you about it

41:54.120 --> 41:55.255
when we get off of work, and

41:55.255 --> 41:56.523
we're too tired, and you want to

41:56.523 --> 41:57.524
sleep, and you want to rest, and

41:57.524 --> 41:58.525
it's not the time.

41:58.525 --> 41:59.526
So, when is the time?

41:59.526 --> 42:00.534
We can talk about this

42:00.534 --> 42:01.535
when we...

42:01.535 --> 42:02.536
I don't know, not now.

42:02.536 --> 42:03.369
I'm about to go out there.

42:03.369 --> 42:04.137
I'm up in, like, ten minutes.

42:04.137 --> 42:04.971
You didn't even come

42:04.971 --> 42:05.972
to Atlanta with me.

42:05.972 --> 42:06.807
You didn't want to come to

42:06.807 --> 42:07.808
Atlanta with me.

42:07.808 --> 42:08.675
I wanted to do it with you.

42:08.675 --> 42:09.676
For what, Trin?

42:09.676 --> 42:10.511
For what? What am I gonna go

42:10.511 --> 42:11.512
to Atlanta for?

42:11.512 --> 42:12.345
For me! For us.

42:12.345 --> 42:13.179
We‐we stayed, and went

42:13.179 --> 42:14.180
through Atlanta.

42:14.180 --> 42:14.981
We got off the road, I go home.

42:14.981 --> 42:15.916
In and out, and we

42:15.916 --> 42:16.917
go right home to Pensacola,

42:16.917 --> 42:17.751
where there's nothing to do

42:17.751 --> 42:18.752
there.

42:18.752 --> 42:20.020
I just want us to have a little

42:20.020 --> 42:21.755
getaway place...

42:21.755 --> 42:23.690
A getaway place for you.

42:23.690 --> 42:24.691
Ain't no getaway for me in

42:24.691 --> 42:25.692
Atlanta.

42:25.692 --> 42:26.727
You want to get away to get away

42:26.727 --> 42:27.728
from me to go to Atlanta.

42:27.728 --> 42:28.729
That's what you want.

42:28.729 --> 42:29.530
That's not true.

42:29.530 --> 42:30.531
Yes, it is.

42:30.531 --> 42:31.364
That is not true.

42:31.364 --> 42:32.132
You want somewhere to

42:32.132 --> 42:32.933
go because all you do is bury

42:32.933 --> 42:33.900
Pensacola, you don't like it

42:33.900 --> 42:34.701
there, and you're talking about

42:34.701 --> 42:35.468
getting this for us.

42:35.468 --> 42:36.369
This ain't for us.

42:36.369 --> 42:37.170
But I'm there for

42:37.170 --> 42:38.004
you, so why can't you be

42:38.004 --> 42:38.705
somewhere else with me for a

42:38.705 --> 42:39.706
little bit?

42:39.706 --> 42:41.374
I expected Jon to at least hear

42:41.374 --> 42:42.509
what I had to say.

42:42.509 --> 42:43.677
I couldn't even get out what I

42:43.677 --> 42:45.812
wanted to say, or really

42:45.812 --> 42:46.847
explain, which I think, would

42:46.847 --> 42:48.281
make him look at it different.

42:48.281 --> 42:50.684
Jon thinks I'm trying to leave

42:50.684 --> 42:52.719
or run or get away from him,

42:52.719 --> 42:54.120
or don't want to be around him,

42:54.120 --> 42:55.121
or‐or be with him, and that is

42:55.121 --> 42:56.557
not the case at all.

42:56.557 --> 42:58.592
So, now, like, I don't know

42:58.592 --> 43:00.066
what to do.

43:00.066 --> 43:01.067
We have no outlet.

43:01.067 --> 43:02.202
I got to go.

43:02.202 --> 43:03.203
I have to go. I got to go.

43:03.203 --> 43:04.304
All right, all

43:04.304 --> 43:06.372
right.

43:11.545 --> 43:13.279
Next on <i>Total Divas...</i>

43:15.882 --> 43:16.817
I'd be interested to

43:16.817 --> 43:17.818
know what your guys' biggest

43:17.818 --> 43:18.819
fears are.

43:18.819 --> 43:19.820
Heights.

43:19.820 --> 43:21.822
I'm not going parasailing.

43:21.822 --> 43:22.823
Commitment.

43:22.823 --> 43:23.724
You need to write a

43:23.724 --> 43:24.725
poem.

43:25.726 --> 43:26.527
I'm scared of Tahoe

43:26.527 --> 43:27.528
Tessie.

43:27.528 --> 43:29.963
As kids, I swear, I saw shadows.

43:29.963 --> 43:31.998
Tahoe Tessie's real.

43:32.999 --> 43:34.635
We have decided to run

43:34.635 --> 43:35.636
into our fears.

43:35.636 --> 43:36.837
I love you guys.
