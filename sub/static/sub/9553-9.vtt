01:33.130 --> 01:34.630
Oh, no, thanks,
Al, I can't.

01:34.630 --> 01:35.550
My tummy hurts, too.

01:35.550 --> 01:36.800
Your tummy?

01:36.800 --> 01:38.130
Gut Fonz, gut.

01:38.130 --> 01:40.130
You know, like the
regular guys say: "Gut."

01:41.630 --> 01:43.640
Wait a minute,
is it my food?

01:43.640 --> 01:45.140
It can't be.

01:45.140 --> 01:47.140
This is my mother's
own recipe.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.140
She gave it to me for
my 21st birthday.

01:49.140 --> 01:51.030
AL:
I can still
remember it.

01:51.030 --> 01:52.730
I wanted a car.

01:54.110 --> 01:56.620
Just take it easy, Al.

01:56.620 --> 01:58.120
It's not your food.

01:58.120 --> 01:59.070
It's the school's food.

01:59.070 --> 02:00.490
Yeah.
Good!

02:00.490 --> 02:02.160
AL:
I mean, terrible.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.460
You know, something
must be going around,

02:04.460 --> 02:06.460
because so many
kids are sick.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.380
Lookit, the place
is half empty.

02:08.380 --> 02:12.330
I'm afraid this Turkey Hop
is going to be a flop.

02:12.330 --> 02:15.340
But I don't care.

02:15.340 --> 02:17.340
I can handle it, no problem.

02:17.340 --> 02:17.840
(weakly):
I can.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.640
(quiet whimper)

02:21.930 --> 02:23.840
I really don't
feel good.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.730
Hey guys,
guess what happened...

02:25.730 --> 02:28.150
Hey, you started sucking
your thumb again.

02:28.150 --> 02:29.570
Good one, Fonz,
good one.

02:29.570 --> 02:31.070
Not so good.

02:31.070 --> 02:33.570
I loosened my cap biting
in to my meat loaf at school.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.440
Must have been well done.

02:34.440 --> 02:36.160
Hey, good one Malph,
good one.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.440
I still got it.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.940
I'm a man in pain,
but I still got it.

02:38.940 --> 02:40.440
Yeah, there was a bone
in my meat loaf.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.450
Look, I saved it.
Oh, yeah? What are
you going to do with it,

02:43.450 --> 02:46.830
put it under your pillow
and wait to get a dollar
from the bone fairy?

02:46.830 --> 02:48.670
Well, this could
be serious.

02:48.670 --> 02:50.670
Upset stomachs,
bones in the food.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.170
You know, ever since the
school got that new cook,

02:53.670 --> 02:54.670
the food has been terrible.

02:54.670 --> 02:55.680
Oh, what are
you talking about?

02:55.680 --> 02:58.180
I mean, all school food is--
how do you say it?--

02:58.180 --> 02:59.510
Crud.

03:01.210 --> 03:04.220
Yeah, but this isn't
even your everyday crud.

03:04.220 --> 03:06.970
Yeah? Well, then stop whining
about it and do something, huh?

03:06.970 --> 03:08.560
FONZIE:
There, Mr. Pad and Pencil?

03:08.560 --> 03:11.190
Yeah, I could write a
story for the school paper.

03:11.190 --> 03:11.980
Are you kidding?

03:11.980 --> 03:13.310
You can't beat
the system.

03:13.310 --> 03:14.390
Yeah, you're right.

03:14.390 --> 03:15.230
You'll get expelled.

03:15.230 --> 03:16.700
Yeah, you're right.

03:16.700 --> 03:19.700
Aren't you always talking
about being a star reporter?

03:19.700 --> 03:20.620
Yeah, you're right.

03:20.620 --> 03:22.040
Yeah, but you can't
go to college

03:22.040 --> 03:23.400
if you get thrown out
of high school.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.790
Yeah, you're right.

03:24.790 --> 03:28.290
If you don't have
"intestine" fortitude

03:28.290 --> 03:30.290
to write the truth,
forget it.

03:30.290 --> 03:31.290
Yeah, you're right.

03:31.290 --> 03:32.250
And you're right.

03:32.250 --> 03:34.750
Oh, look at me,
I'm wishy-washy.

03:34.750 --> 03:37.250
He's right.
He's right.
You're right.

03:38.750 --> 03:42.260
I'm a senior, and I'm still
not a tough reporter,

03:42.260 --> 03:43.670
but I'm gonna become one.

03:43.670 --> 03:46.090
He's right.
This is a very good story.

03:46.590 --> 03:48.600
The wire services might want
to pick up on this.

03:48.600 --> 03:51.100
Every kid in America will
want to read about this:

03:51.100 --> 03:52.930
Scandal in School Cafeteria.

03:52.930 --> 03:54.270
Extra, extra!

presses, will you?

03:57.520 --> 03:59.020
Whoa!

04:02.410 --> 04:05.780
Hey, listen, you guys, you, uh,
finish discussing this problem

04:05.780 --> 04:08.280

better to do and... you don't.

Trust me.

04:20.380 --> 04:22.180
Your father will
fly into a rage

04:22.180 --> 04:24.180
and he'll say
"Over my dead body!"

04:24.180 --> 04:25.680
Then you'll act discouraged

04:26.180 --> 04:29.190
and go up and put on the
dress you really want to buy.

04:29.190 --> 04:30.600
That's how I handle
your father.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.270
Gee, marriage is fun.

04:32.270 --> 04:34.560
Howard?
HOWARD:
Yeah?

04:34.560 --> 04:37.560
Joanie wants your opinion
on a new outfit, dear.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.360
Okay.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.200
(humming happily)

04:41.200 --> 04:43.700
Wants a man's
point of view, huh?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.200
All righty.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.700
♪ Ta-da! ♪

04:47.700 --> 04:48.660
Well?

04:48.660 --> 04:51.660
Over my dead body.

04:51.660 --> 04:54.160
Oh, darn, I don't
think he likes it.

04:54.160 --> 04:57.130
Oh, but everybody's
wearing short shorts.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.550
If that was any shorter,
it would be a belt.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.500
Oh, gee.

05:08.510 --> 05:11.840
Poor dear, I think her
little heart is broken.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.730
Well, Marion, I'm sorry
if I hurt her feelings,

05:14.730 --> 05:16.600
but years from now,
she'll thank me.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.430
Dear, you just
had a big dinner,

05:18.430 --> 05:19.740
I wish you wouldn't nibble.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.410
RICHIE:
Mom, Dad!

05:22.410 --> 05:24.240
Mom, Dad!
Over here.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.240
Oh, good.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.740
I got it.

05:26.740 --> 05:28.240
I got a story right here
that's gonna blow

05:28.240 --> 05:30.750
the whole Jefferson cafeteria
scandal wide open.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.250
Listen to this:

05:32.250 --> 05:35.250
Headline, "Tables Turned
on School Cafeteria."

05:35.250 --> 05:37.250
You get it?
Tables turned?

05:37.250 --> 05:39.510
Isn't he clever?

05:41.870 --> 05:43.210
Go ahead, Scoop.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.010
All right...

05:45.010 --> 05:47.510
"Byline,
Richie Cunningham.

05:47.510 --> 05:49.520
Several students barely escaped
death recently..."

05:49.520 --> 05:52.020
Barely escaped death?

05:52.020 --> 05:53.520
Yeah, Dad.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.020
Ralph and I
had upset stomachs.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.520
It could have
been gas.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.020
May I go on, Mom?

05:58.020 --> 06:00.030
Oh let him go
on, Howard.

06:00.030 --> 06:02.030
Go on, Richie.

06:02.030 --> 06:04.530
"Informed sources report
excessive traces of bone

06:05.030 --> 06:06.730
"and other foreign matter
in the meat loaf..."

06:07.230 --> 06:08.530
What informed sources?

06:08.530 --> 06:11.820
Well, it sounds better
than saying Potsie found a bone

06:11.820 --> 06:13.820
in the meat loaf.

06:13.820 --> 06:15.740
There are no bones
in meat loaf.

06:15.740 --> 06:18.630
Oh, yeah, what does that
look like, gravy?

06:18.630 --> 06:20.130
That looks like a bone.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.130
That's why I'm
saving it for evidence.

06:22.130 --> 06:23.130
Oh, come on, Richie,

06:23.630 --> 06:25.130
are you really gonna
turn this story in?

06:25.130 --> 06:27.140
Sure, I am. Why not?
It's the truth.

06:27.140 --> 06:28.140
What truth?

06:28.140 --> 06:29.420
You don't have any facts.

06:29.420 --> 06:30.590
I've got plenty of facts.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.310
You haven't got
a stitch of evidence.

06:32.310 --> 06:33.680
I've got piles of evidence.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.090
Name one pile.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.510
All right.

06:36.510 --> 06:37.510
Okay, how about the...

06:38.010 --> 06:39.520
Well, then there's the...

06:40.020 --> 06:41.020
And then we got...

06:41.520 --> 06:42.770
There's Potsie's bone.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.650
Oh. You already know
about that.

06:44.650 --> 06:47.660
All right, okay, so I got
to find a few facts

06:47.660 --> 06:48.660
to fill in some holes.

06:48.660 --> 06:49.660
I'm not a tough
reporter yet,

06:50.160 --> 06:52.160
but I'm gonna become one,
Dad, you wait and see.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.660
I'm gonna get you evidence
that you won't believe.

06:59.170 --> 07:03.170
Well, I guess you're not gonna
like this either, huh, Dad?

07:04.670 --> 07:06.680
Oh, that's very nice.

07:07.180 --> 07:08.680
I like that.

07:08.680 --> 07:11.680
Keeps you all covered up.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.680
That's all right
if she buys it?

07:14.180 --> 07:15.180
Right, Howard?

07:15.180 --> 07:16.690
Of course.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.690
Well, now, we'll just
return the other one.

07:26.110 --> 07:28.610
Why do they pull this trick
on me every year?

07:55.510 --> 07:56.510
(sniffs)

07:56.510 --> 07:58.510
It's not bad.

07:58.510 --> 08:01.510
MAN:
Leave me alone,
would you, Curly?

08:04.320 --> 08:07.070
I don't want to buy any
tickets to the Turkey Hop.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.570
What am I, a child?

08:08.570 --> 08:10.570
All I want to do is get
this stuff loaded.

08:10.570 --> 08:12.580
Now what grade
meat is this?

08:13.080 --> 08:14.030
U.S. Bad Choice.

08:14.030 --> 08:16.330
Listen, I'm getting a
little nervous, Curly.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.160
Those kids around school,

08:18.160 --> 08:20.170
they haven't been looking
too good lately.

08:20.170 --> 08:21.170
Will you relax, Louie?

08:21.170 --> 08:22.670
And wait until we
start switching

08:22.670 --> 08:24.170
the vegetables
on them next week.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.670
I don't want to hear
about that, okay?

08:25.670 --> 08:27.670
All I want you to do is
take this good meat

08:27.670 --> 08:29.680
and sell it to that
fancy restaurant, okay?

08:29.680 --> 08:31.180
Now let's go.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.179
Hey, kid, what are
you doing here?

08:35.679 --> 08:37.679
Just sweeping.

08:37.679 --> 08:40.690
Oh... are you
the new janitor--

08:40.690 --> 08:42.970
that, uh, that foreign
exchange student?

08:42.970 --> 08:46.280
(with Swedish accent):
Ya.

08:47.780 --> 08:51.780
Ya, that's me, I the new
foreign exchange student.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.780
I'm Gunnar Lindquist.

08:53.780 --> 08:56.290
I work a little after school,
cleaning up,

08:56.290 --> 08:58.790
and making little extra money
with my bootseen.

08:58.790 --> 09:01.210
Your what?

09:01.210 --> 09:02.660
My bootseen.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.130
My-- Swedish for my broom.

09:04.130 --> 09:06.080
Yeah, well, listen,
how do you say

09:06.080 --> 09:08.500
"finish up and get
lost" in Swedish?

09:08.500 --> 09:10.250
Volvo.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.550
Well, you better
do it quick, kid.

09:14.550 --> 09:17.060
Hey, you know, I always
thought Volvo was a car.

09:17.060 --> 09:18.340
So did I, Louie.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.440
(with gruff voice):
All right, put up your hands.

09:32.440 --> 09:33.940
But I'm the jan...

09:33.940 --> 09:35.360
Oh, Fonz, what are
you doing here?

09:35.360 --> 09:37.280
Malph told me what
you were up to,

09:37.280 --> 09:38.780
and I wanted to see

09:38.780 --> 09:40.780
how an investigative
reporter worked, huh?

09:40.780 --> 09:42.280
Hey, can you see through these?

09:42.280 --> 09:44.200
Oh, Fonz...

09:44.200 --> 09:46.170
Fonz, I am really
on to something.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.590
I've been watching
these guys all day long.

09:48.590 --> 09:50.510
Yeah? Let me take a picture
of you in this outfit.

09:51.010 --> 09:53.010
You look great.
No, Fonz, this is not
a very good time...

09:53.010 --> 09:55.010
Stand there, smile... hold
your broom... here we go.

09:55.010 --> 09:56.350
The cook is coming
back and...

09:56.350 --> 09:58.380
Hey, hey, hey, smile,
then talk-- all right.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.680
Do me a favor, get up against
the counter here.

10:00.680 --> 10:01.680
Get up against the counter.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.140
All right, hold it, hold it.

10:03.640 --> 10:04.970
Oh that's great,
that's great.

10:04.970 --> 10:07.270
All right, now talk
This is bigger than
I thought, Fonz.

10:07.270 --> 10:08.770
They're selling
the good meat,

10:08.770 --> 10:10.780
and they're giving
the bad meat to the kids.

10:10.780 --> 10:12.780
I got to take some
pictures of this stuff.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.280
Hey, listen, Fonz,
could you take the pictures?

10:14.780 --> 10:16.280
'Cause, 'cause, see,
I want to look

10:16.280 --> 10:17.780
in the books for a minute, okay?

10:17.780 --> 10:19.290
I'll explain later.

10:21.790 --> 10:24.160
Oh, this is
really big time...
Aw...

10:24.160 --> 10:27.040
These guys are really
crooked, I...

10:27.540 --> 10:29.500
Fonz, you're not taking
any pictures.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.960
I can't take any pictures.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.880
Yeah, well, I know
it's bad meat, Fonz,

10:33.880 --> 10:36.390
but see, that's why we want
to take pictures of it.

10:36.390 --> 10:38.390
It's not the meat,
it's that in the pan.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.810
Oh, well,
this is good, Fonz.

10:41.810 --> 10:43.090
There's nothing wrong
with this.

10:43.090 --> 10:44.010
It's just liver.

10:44.010 --> 10:46.010
(gasping in horror)

10:51.180 --> 10:52.690
Get that away from me!

10:52.690 --> 10:54.690
Everybody has got weaknesses.

10:55.150 --> 10:56.690
Superman had kryptonite.

10:58.690 --> 11:00.610
Fonz, are you
afraid of liver?

11:00.610 --> 11:02.530
I am not afraid! No!

11:02.530 --> 11:04.360
I'm not afraid.
Just get it away from me!

11:04.360 --> 11:08.750
You just don't like it
'cause it's all wet-looking

11:08.750 --> 11:10.200
and drippy, and brown.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.590
Hey, listen, how would you like
to be wet and drippy and brown?

11:13.590 --> 11:15.760
I wouldn't like that.
I'll take the pictures, Fonz.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.040
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.550
Listen, I don't like that,
I don't eat that,

11:19.550 --> 11:22.050
and I don't go around with
guys that hang out with that.

11:22.050 --> 11:23.550
Ugh! Yuck!

11:34.560 --> 11:37.900
Hey, hey, kid, what are you
doing with the camera?

11:37.900 --> 11:40.730
(with Swedish accent):
I just taking some pictures
for my cousin, Ole.

11:40.730 --> 11:42.030
Smile.

11:44.150 --> 11:45.960
(normal voice):
Great, I'll see you later.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.240
Hey, that kid was
watching us.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.740
He's gonna turn us in!
We could go to prison!

11:51.740 --> 11:53.750
I hope not.

11:53.750 --> 11:55.250
I heard the food stinks.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.850
Sure, sure, I'll give you
an autograph, here you go.

12:11.850 --> 12:13.350
Scoop Cunningham.

12:13.350 --> 12:15.820
Hey, you know, I'm his buddy,
I helped him write it.

12:15.820 --> 12:17.820
Come on, guys, we
should be rehearsing.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.270
The Turkey Hop's
tomorrow night.

12:19.270 --> 12:20.690
Don't worry Pots,
this is better.

12:20.690 --> 12:22.020
POTSIE:
You're right.

12:22.020 --> 12:23.780
Here, I'll sign anything.

12:23.780 --> 12:27.200
Oh, a note for me?
Thank you.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.200
Oh, I can't do that.

12:30.700 --> 12:32.700
I can.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.700
My folks are out of town.

12:34.700 --> 12:37.210
All right, girls,
let's split.

12:37.210 --> 12:39.180
Wait... Wait a minute,
who wrote the note?

12:39.180 --> 12:42.130
Wait a minute, girls,
who wrote the note? Tell me!

12:42.130 --> 12:43.630
Cunningham, uh...
I want to thank you.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.630
I heard that you mentioned
me in your article.

12:45.630 --> 12:47.130
Of course I did, Fonz.

12:47.130 --> 12:49.640
I never would've written the
article if it wasn't for you.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.020
Yeah, that's true.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.390
Hey, Fonz, not only were you
right about the administration

12:53.390 --> 12:56.190
not being mad at me,
but I'm now a star reporter.

12:56.190 --> 12:57.980
Hey, what did I tell you, Scoop?

12:57.980 --> 13:00.310
You print the truth,
you're in like Flynn, huh?

13:00.310 --> 13:02.110
Yeah, you're right. I'm printing
a follow-up story, too.

13:02.620 --> 13:04.620
It's the story behind the story.

13:04.620 --> 13:06.570
I'm calling it
"The Story Behind the Story."

13:06.570 --> 13:08.400
That's very clever.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.740
Want a preview, Fonz?

13:10.740 --> 13:12.240
Yeah, sure--
let me see that.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.240
Yeah.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.240
Hey, that's great.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.750
You put in the part
about your, uh, your disguise.

13:17.750 --> 13:18.630
Yeah.
That was funny.

13:18.630 --> 13:20.500
And about me taking
the pictures.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.500
That's good, that's good.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.840
Oh, oh... excuse me
for a minute, okay?

13:25.340 --> 13:26.840
Sure.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.840
No, now wait a minute, Fonz.
What are you doing?

13:29.340 --> 13:30.340
Oh, I'm just crossing out
this part

13:30.340 --> 13:31.840
about me and the liver.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.850
No, no, Fonz, you can't
cross out that part.

13:33.850 --> 13:35.350
You see, that's part
of the story.

13:35.350 --> 13:37.320
That's why I didn't
get pictures of the meat.

13:37.320 --> 13:38.350
Hey, listen, Richie,

13:38.350 --> 13:39.850
the rest of this article
is terrific.

13:39.850 --> 13:41.350
I just don't want
that part about me

13:41.350 --> 13:42.320
and the liver, you know.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.270
Yeah, but it's the truth,

13:43.770 --> 13:45.160
and you said to always print
the truth.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.830
Not this truth.

13:46.830 --> 13:48.860
That's censorship.

13:48.860 --> 13:51.110
Hey, it's got nothing
to do with censorship.

13:51.110 --> 13:54.370
This ain't going in the article,
that's all.

13:54.370 --> 13:57.170
Fonz, this is very interesting,
you know.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.670
It's like the Lone Ranger.

13:58.670 --> 14:00.540
Everybody's always trying
to pull off his mask.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.790
I wouldn't do that.

14:02.790 --> 14:06.630
But don't you see that this is
why this is such a great story?

14:07.130 --> 14:08.100
Because I'm pulling off
the mask.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.970
But it's my mask!

14:09.970 --> 14:11.350
Fonz, it's no big deal.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.800
So what if you're scared
of liver.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.270
Will you keep that down?

14:15.270 --> 14:16.770
Fonz, it's a humorous
sidelight, that's all.

14:17.270 --> 14:18.770
It doesn't hurt anybody,
and it's true.

14:18.770 --> 14:19.730
So I'm printing it.

14:19.730 --> 14:22.140
After everything
I've done for you?

14:22.140 --> 14:24.610
I give you advice about chicks,
I protect you from bullies...

14:24.610 --> 14:27.070
But you're also the one
who told me about truth

14:27.070 --> 14:28.370
and intestinal fortitude.

14:28.370 --> 14:30.650
Cunningham, let me
just put it this way:

14:30.650 --> 14:34.040
If you don't rewrite the story,
I'm going to rewrite your face.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.960
Well, I know
your reputation, Fonz,

14:37.460 --> 14:39.460
but you are now dealing
with a tough reporter.

14:39.460 --> 14:40.460
Oh, yeah?

14:40.460 --> 14:41.960
Yeah. And just remember,

14:41.960 --> 14:43.920
the pen is mightier
than the sword.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.840
Ah.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.720
Sometimes.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.170
Well, all right, Fonz,

14:51.170 --> 14:52.680
you just do what
you have to do,

14:52.680 --> 14:54.680
but I'm printing every
word of this story.

14:56.680 --> 14:57.680
All right.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.680
All right, I'm not going
to work you over.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.180
Just listen to me

15:01.180 --> 15:02.690
'cause I'm only going
to say this one time.

15:02.690 --> 15:04.190
We are no longer friends.

15:04.190 --> 15:05.190
Oh, now wait
a minute, Fonz.

15:05.190 --> 15:07.190
Oh, there's one more thing,
Cunningham, one more thing.

15:07.190 --> 15:10.190
Former friends don't talk.

15:10.190 --> 15:11.690
You gotta
be kidding.

15:11.690 --> 15:14.200
After everything we've been
through together?

15:14.200 --> 15:15.530
I don't believe this.

15:25.290 --> 15:26.790
I believe it.

15:32.720 --> 15:35.100
(to theme song melody):
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la... ♪

15:35.100 --> 15:36.890
Oh, I tell you, Marion,

15:36.890 --> 15:39.890
looking at these old slides
is just terrific.

15:39.890 --> 15:43.280
Hey, when was the last time
I weighed 150 pounds?

15:43.280 --> 15:46.560
Are you feeding a bear?

15:46.560 --> 15:47.400
Uh-huh.

15:47.400 --> 15:51.150
Yellowstone Park, 1945.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.490
Hello.

15:53.490 --> 15:54.450
JOANIE:
Hi, Fonz.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.240
Oh, Arthur.

16:00.130 --> 16:01.630
Hey, Mrs. C,
how's everything?

16:01.630 --> 16:02.630
Nice to see you.

16:02.630 --> 16:04.630
Arthur, can you fix
my sewing machine?

16:04.630 --> 16:06.130
You're so good
at that kind of thing.

16:06.130 --> 16:07.630
Hey, sure I can.

16:07.630 --> 16:11.640
You've got nice legs
there, Shortcake.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.140
Mr. C., you shouldn't
be looking at that

16:14.140 --> 16:16.640
with ladies in the room.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.100
What's that?

16:23.100 --> 16:25.600
You got a bear, a chubby kid
and a skinny guy.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.490
You know these people?

16:27.350 --> 16:28.820
That's us!

16:28.820 --> 16:31.610
Aw, what a cute family.

16:31.610 --> 16:32.910
Would you mind fixing
the machine, please?

16:32.910 --> 16:34.190
Yeah, sure.

16:34.190 --> 16:36.030
Mom, could you
put some cuffs on these

16:36.030 --> 16:38.000
and keep them
the same length?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.500
Hey, uh, I'm really
sorry, Mrs. C.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.500
This is the other model,
it's way beyond repair.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.000
You've got
to send this out.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.010
Oh, Arthur,
now you always fix it.

16:46.010 --> 16:48.010
You just do like this.

16:48.010 --> 16:49.510
Mrs. C., I think
you're mistaken.

16:49.510 --> 16:51.510
I only repair cars.

17:03.020 --> 17:04.390
(motor hums)

17:11.780 --> 17:13.150
Let me tell you something.

17:13.150 --> 17:14.780
I did that for
you, Shortcake,

17:14.780 --> 17:16.569
not Scoop over here.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.569
Good-bye, Shortcake.

17:17.569 --> 17:20.069
Good-bye,
Mr. C., Mrs. C.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.710
What was that
all about?

17:26.710 --> 17:28.000
Oh, it's nothing.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.750
I got the dope.

17:29.750 --> 17:31.250
Oh, you don't know
anything at all.

17:31.750 --> 17:32.750
Fonzie broke Richie's pen

17:32.750 --> 17:34.250
and they're not talking
to each other now.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.750
Oh, that's what
you think it is?

17:35.750 --> 17:37.170
My friend was there...

17:37.170 --> 17:40.060
Okay, okay,
you two.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.560
Look, I want to talk to Richie
alone for a minute.

17:42.560 --> 17:43.560
I know what happened,

17:43.560 --> 17:45.060
because Jenny Piccolo
was there.

17:45.060 --> 17:46.570
Tell me about
it upstairs.

17:46.570 --> 17:47.900
Tell me from
the beginning.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.740
The pen sounds
like the end.

17:49.740 --> 17:51.740
Jenny Piccolo went
to Arnold's to meet boys...

17:51.740 --> 17:53.240
Jenny Piccolo
is boy crazy.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.740
I know, she's teaching
me everything!
Oh!

17:59.950 --> 18:01.450
Did you and Fonzie
have a fight?

18:01.450 --> 18:04.950
Yeah, he's getting
worked up over nothing.
Mm.

18:04.950 --> 18:07.950
Not wanting me to tell
that he's squeamish about liver.

18:07.950 --> 18:09.960
Isn't it crazy to be
scared of liver?

18:09.960 --> 18:11.460
Not to him.

18:11.460 --> 18:13.880
Why do you want to write this
story about Fonzie, anyway?

18:13.880 --> 18:16.850
Because I'm a tough reporter.

18:17.350 --> 18:19.300
And it's the truth,
and it should be printed.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.050
Oh, and a lot of people
will run to read it, huh?

18:22.050 --> 18:23.970
Yeah.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.470
Yeah, it's good reporting.

18:25.470 --> 18:27.810
It's good business
and I'm tough.

18:29.140 --> 18:31.640
Tell me something, how would
you feel if you found out

18:31.640 --> 18:34.030
that Stan Musial
was afraid of the dark?

18:34.030 --> 18:37.450
"Stan the Man"
afraid of the dark?

18:37.450 --> 18:38.950
But he plays
all those night games,

18:38.950 --> 18:41.450
standing out there
all alone in the outfield.

18:41.450 --> 18:43.740
How could Stan the Man be
afraid of the dark?

18:43.740 --> 18:45.490
He couldn't,
I just made that up.

18:45.490 --> 18:47.880
Oh, Dad.
Richie...

18:47.880 --> 18:50.330
My whole point is,
that if somebody

18:50.330 --> 18:52.330
does something wrong,
and it harms people,

18:52.330 --> 18:54.330
well, then it's your job
to report it.

18:54.330 --> 18:56.340
And you did your job very well.

18:56.340 --> 18:57.840
I mean, the cook
and his accomplice,

18:57.840 --> 18:59.840
they've both been grabbed.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.340
But to print a story just
to shock people

19:02.340 --> 19:04.310
and sell a few papers,
I think that's wrong.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.770
Well, well, what if this story
was about a stranger?

19:10.770 --> 19:12.100
What if it wasn't
about a friend of mine?

19:12.100 --> 19:13.940
Friendship's got
nothing to do with it.

19:13.940 --> 19:16.440
Look, Fonzie is a hero
in the neighborhood.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.940
Now, if he hasn't done
anything wrong,

19:17.940 --> 19:19.410
why do you want to hurt him?

19:22.360 --> 19:24.860
Dad, are you saying,
as a father,

19:24.860 --> 19:26.870
that I can't print
this article?

19:26.870 --> 19:29.870
I am just saying that I've seen
enough of these stories

19:29.870 --> 19:31.370
hurt a lot of people.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.840
It's just my opinion.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.790
Okay.

19:36.290 --> 19:38.210
I have my own opinions,
you know, Dad.

19:38.210 --> 19:40.180
I'm a senior.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.350
Yes, you are.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.080
All right, take it easy, Al.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.080
It'll work out.

20:13.080 --> 20:14.080
No, it's not going
to work out.

20:14.580 --> 20:15.580
We rehearsed all week.
Relax, relax.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.080
Hi, guys.
POTSIE & RALPH:
Hey, Rich.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.880
Hey, I like that, Al.
How's it going?

20:18.880 --> 20:20.140
How's it going?

20:20.140 --> 20:21.500
The Turkey Hop
is a turkey.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.390
Oh, well, that's cute,

20:23.390 --> 20:25.390
but, uh, what's going
on around here?

20:25.390 --> 20:26.730
Keep it low,
will you, Rich?

20:26.730 --> 20:28.390
Yeah, Fonzie
wants it quiet.

20:28.390 --> 20:30.850
Oh. Where is Fonzie?
He's in his office.

20:30.850 --> 20:33.350
I better go talk to him.
I wouldn't do that, Rich.

20:33.350 --> 20:34.850
Yeah, right after
he said he wanted quiet,

20:34.850 --> 20:36.770
he said no one was allowed
to mention your name.

20:36.770 --> 20:38.240
Yeah, just to be safe,

20:38.240 --> 20:40.660
Richie Buckhalter changed
his name to Herman Katz.

20:46.530 --> 20:48.450
I can do this.

20:48.450 --> 20:50.420
Liver.
Hey, I did it.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.250
Fonz?

20:52.250 --> 20:54.620
Hey, I heard a sound,
but that's impossible,

20:55.120 --> 20:58.120
because the person knows
not to talk to me.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.630
Come on, Fonz.

20:59.630 --> 21:01.130
This article
thing is getting

21:01.130 --> 21:02.130
completely out of hand.

21:02.130 --> 21:03.630
I think we ought
to have a talk

21:03.630 --> 21:04.960
about this article thing.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.270
Hey, I don't care
about your article.

21:06.270 --> 21:07.770
Because by the time it
comes out,

21:07.770 --> 21:10.770
I will have my problem solved.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.270
Liver...

21:12.270 --> 21:14.270
(quietly):
Aaayyh...

21:14.270 --> 21:15.720
is chock full...

21:15.720 --> 21:17.690
I know, it's chock full
of vitamins and minerals,

21:17.690 --> 21:19.700
and very good for you,
and none of that matters

21:19.700 --> 21:21.560
because I'm cutting that
out of my article.

21:22.730 --> 21:24.030
Who cares if Stan Musial

21:24.030 --> 21:26.030
is afraid of the dark?

21:26.030 --> 21:28.540
Stan the Man is
afraid of the dark?

21:28.540 --> 21:30.040
I don't know.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.040
Then why did you say it?

21:31.040 --> 21:32.490
I was just trying
to make a point.

21:32.490 --> 21:33.910
Well, being a star reporter,

21:33.910 --> 21:35.660
you ain't doing
such a hot job, huh?

21:35.660 --> 21:38.050
What I'm trying
to say, Fonz, is that

21:38.050 --> 21:40.330
I was all wrong
about the liver.

21:40.330 --> 21:41.080
I know that.

21:41.470 --> 21:43.550
I just, I just
couldn't understand

21:43.550 --> 21:45.000
why you got so
upset about it.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.470
I will tell you
why I'm so upset.

21:48.470 --> 21:51.980
A lot of people try to take
the Lone Ranger's mask off,

21:51.980 --> 21:55.310
but Tonto never tried.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.900
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

22:00.900 --> 22:02.520
Yeah.

22:02.520 --> 22:03.360
Hey, look at this.

22:03.360 --> 22:05.320
Alfred gave me this
for my office.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.360
It is a hand dryer, huh?

22:07.860 --> 22:08.860
(whirring)
Dig that, huh?

22:08.860 --> 22:09.860
No, no, no--
wash your hands first,

22:09.860 --> 22:11.860
it's more fun wet.
Oh, right.

22:11.860 --> 22:14.330
HOWARD:
Alfred,

22:14.330 --> 22:16.340
you look like
you just fell off

22:16.340 --> 22:18.840
a box of Dutch Masters cigars.

22:23.340 --> 22:25.340
Could you smile
just a little bit?

22:25.340 --> 22:26.630
Come on, smile.
Yeah, Al, smile.

22:26.630 --> 22:30.300
Oh, how can I smile when
my Turkey Hop is dying?

22:30.300 --> 22:31.680
Don't worry about it.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.550
It's gonna be all right.
AL:
Sure.

22:33.550 --> 22:37.310
Hey, why all
the long faces here?

22:37.310 --> 22:39.690
This is a festive hop.

22:39.690 --> 22:41.190
I want to see you smile.

22:41.190 --> 22:42.640
Now, that's better, yeah.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.700
Let's groove it and hop here.

22:44.700 --> 22:45.700
All right, Fonz,
a little music.

22:46.200 --> 22:46.700
Great! Okay.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.450
Come on up, Al.
Right here.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.740
Right in the middle.

23:27.320 --> 23:28.860
Oh, we know

23:28.860 --> 23:30.660
I got to find
the music to that one.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.030
That's nostalgia.

23:35.860 --> 23:36.870
Fonzie, are you sure

23:36.870 --> 23:38.670
you want to go
through with this?

23:38.670 --> 23:40.920
I know what I'm doing, Mr. C.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.670
You know it's
not necessary.

23:42.670 --> 23:44.010
I gotta do it.

23:44.010 --> 23:45.960
Okay.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.290
All right, Al,
bring it in!
