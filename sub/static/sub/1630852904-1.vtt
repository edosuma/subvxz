[gasping]

03:18.807 --> 03:21.113
[breathing heavily]

03:29.861 --> 03:31.211
[exhales deeply]

03:31.254 --> 03:33.822
[music playing faintly
on speakers]

03:36.564 --> 03:38.392
-[man] You want cheese?
-Sure.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.045
Lettuce, tomato?

03:40.089 --> 03:42.265
Uh, let me get some
lettuce, tomato,

03:42.309 --> 03:43.832
and let me get
some of those peppers.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.225
[mouthing]

03:45.268 --> 03:46.313
Done.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.795
Yo, are you high?

03:51.753 --> 03:53.494
I said peppers,
not cucumbers.

03:54.843 --> 03:57.715
Sorry, sir, my bad.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.283
Mayo, mustard?

04:00.327 --> 04:02.067
Uh, mayo, and, uh,

04:02.111 --> 04:03.678
give me some of that
salt and pepper, buddy.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.767
[phone line ringing]

04:08.726 --> 04:10.424
[receptionist]
Black Canopy Global Security.

04:10.467 --> 04:11.990
Hi, Dorith.
This is Jackson Briggs.

04:12.034 --> 04:13.340
I was just checking
on my status

04:13.383 --> 04:14.906
for the Pakistan rotation.

04:14.950 --> 04:17.300
Um, just trying
to sort my travel.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.520
Mr. Briggs, you know the
agency can't send a soldier

04:19.563 --> 04:21.826
with a history of brain
injuries to a war zone.

04:21.870 --> 04:24.481
No, no, I just got you guys
a full, clean medical.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.091
Yes, but we need

04:26.135 --> 04:28.442
your commanding officer
to certify that.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.444
Yeah, and I've told
the recruiter, like, 12 times.

04:30.487 --> 04:31.923
You know these guys.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.316
They're impossible
to reach on deployment.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.709
But it's coming.
So let's just get

04:34.752 --> 04:36.232
the on-boarding process going

04:36.276 --> 04:38.800
and, I don't know,
get my travel sorted.

04:38.843 --> 04:41.759
Mr. Briggs,
you know we can't do that.

04:41.803 --> 04:44.109
Look, I got other agencies
beating down my door,

04:44.153 --> 04:45.110
so, look...

04:46.764 --> 04:50.420
So, look, I can't wait till
next year's rotation, okay?

04:50.464 --> 04:52.335
And we can't staff you
without that recommendation.

04:53.945 --> 04:57.297
Okay, uh, when do I need
to have it by?

04:57.340 --> 04:59.603
The rotation closes
next Wednesday.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.084
All right,
you'll hear from me.

05:22.931 --> 05:26.326
[breathing heavily]

05:39.991 --> 05:42.342
[ringtone playing]

05:45.867 --> 05:46.955
[ringtone stops]

05:48.478 --> 05:50.480
-Hello.
-Briggs, this is Jones.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.264
Hey, Captain.

05:52.308 --> 05:53.614
Are you in the middle
of something?

05:53.657 --> 05:55.442
No, no, it's a good time.

05:55.485 --> 05:56.791
Yeah, no, I was calling about

05:56.834 --> 05:58.358
that diplomatic
security application

05:58.401 --> 05:59.881
I was hoping you'd
help me with.

05:59.924 --> 06:01.535
Look, I'm calling
about Rodriguez.

06:01.578 --> 06:03.101
He passed away last night.

06:03.145 --> 06:04.276
Stop me
if you already heard this.

06:05.408 --> 06:06.148
No.

06:08.455 --> 06:09.804
No, I didn't hear.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.458
I'm sorry, Briggs.

06:11.501 --> 06:12.763
We're all going
to Patton Barracks

06:12.807 --> 06:13.764
to say goodbye to him.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.985
-When?
-Tomorrow night.

06:19.117 --> 06:19.944
All right.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.774
-Briggs?
-Yeah, I'll be there.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.170
[breathes shakily]

06:42.793 --> 06:44.926
[somber music playing]

06:49.887 --> 06:52.020
[man] Sergeant Rodriguez
was a legend

06:52.586 --> 06:53.630
who never quit.

06:55.850 --> 06:58.853
He burned bright
and then he burned in.

07:00.942 --> 07:02.465
Airborne Ranger in the sky.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.380
[all] Airborne Ranger
in the sky.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.034
You can tell an Airborne
Ranger by his boots!

07:06.077 --> 07:07.818
[all] By his boots!

07:07.862 --> 07:09.646
[singing]

07:13.084 --> 07:14.346
[singing echoes
indistinctly]

07:15.696 --> 07:17.437
-[somber music continues]
-Man.

07:19.047 --> 07:20.440
[sighs]

07:32.539 --> 07:34.236
Just need you to call
and just be like, "He's good."

07:34.279 --> 07:35.933
-No.
-That's it.

07:35.977 --> 07:37.457
-I'm trying to get some money.
-It's not happening.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.806
I'm trying to get
some money, that's it.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.372
-Not happening.
-[Briggs] 200K a year,

07:40.416 --> 07:42.157
-that's all I want.
-[overlapping chatter]

07:42.200 --> 07:43.767
Just, like,
make the call for me.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.073
Yeah, I wish I had that power,

07:45.116 --> 07:46.944
but your boy's
still an E-6, so...

07:46.988 --> 07:48.729
-[laughs]
-...that's not happening.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.295
I love him.
You shut your mouth.

07:50.339 --> 07:51.775
You shut your mouth
when you talk about him.

07:53.777 --> 07:56.084
-[somber music playing]
-[chatter continues]

08:14.711 --> 08:15.799
Good luck, brother.

08:17.758 --> 08:19.890
[all] Taboo! Taboo!

08:19.934 --> 08:21.892
Get up, Kiernan. Come on.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.415
-Oh, no.
-You're pissing me off.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.156
-Let's go.
-Come on. Hey, hey, hey.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.680
-Up, up.
-Hey, hey, figure it out.

08:26.723 --> 08:27.898
Figure it out.

08:29.334 --> 08:31.119
Okay, Briggs, get on with it.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.731
-What?
-You know what.

08:34.775 --> 08:36.385
Hey, you're the one who's
[chuckles]

08:36.428 --> 08:38.256
screening my calls
and ghosting my texts, sir.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.388
Like, what's a girl
supposed to think?

08:39.431 --> 08:41.129
He's supposed to get the hint.

08:41.172 --> 08:42.696
"Hi, it's Captain Jones

08:42.739 --> 08:44.567
calling on behalf
of Staff Sergeant Briggs.

08:44.611 --> 08:45.916
He's a total badass,

08:45.960 --> 08:47.439
he's squared away,
good to go."

08:47.483 --> 08:48.919
You made that call
for 50 other soldiers.

08:48.963 --> 08:50.268
Yeah, who haven't been flagged
for TBIs.

08:50.312 --> 08:51.400
Take it up with the doctors,
not me.

08:51.443 --> 08:52.575
Look, Bear's got half a hand.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.142
You got a, like a chunk

08:54.185 --> 08:55.578
of shrapnel stuck
in your tramp stamp.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.275
Kiernan can barely remember
his name.

08:57.319 --> 08:58.973
-Shut your mouth.
-There's a hundred concussions

08:59.016 --> 09:01.018
walking around
this entire parking lot.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.542
-[Jones grunts]
-And it's not stopping y'all.

09:02.585 --> 09:03.717
In, in.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.677
[sighs] Ours aren't on paper.

09:07.721 --> 09:10.201
Maybe check your email.
I got a full, clean medical.

09:10.245 --> 09:11.463
Yeah? How much
you pay for that?

09:11.507 --> 09:13.074
That's not the point.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.641
Sir, name it,
what do you want?

09:14.684 --> 09:15.990
Tell me what you want.

09:16.033 --> 09:20.168
[sighs] I'm sorry,
get home safe.

09:20.211 --> 09:21.256
[Briggs] You're just gonna
get in... Okay.

09:21.299 --> 09:22.649
You want me to get the...

09:22.692 --> 09:23.824
All right, I'm getting
the knee pads.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.347
[engine starting]

09:25.390 --> 09:26.957
I'm getting the knee pads,
sir. Come on.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.306
Are you really just gonna
pull out right now?

09:28.350 --> 09:29.743
Might as well
just get the strap

09:29.786 --> 09:31.092
out of the center console
and put me down

09:31.135 --> 09:32.441
if I can't get back
in the game,

09:32.484 --> 09:33.921
just go ahead
and end it for me.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.487
Just put me out of my misery,
it's fine.

09:35.531 --> 09:36.880
[Jones] Briggs, get home safe.
That's an order.

09:36.924 --> 09:39.448
Sir, where are you goin'? Sir!

09:40.536 --> 09:41.406
Sir!

09:48.022 --> 09:49.066
[car door opens]

09:56.770 --> 09:58.467
Airborne!

09:58.510 --> 10:00.077
[grunts]

10:00.121 --> 10:02.297
Staff Sergeant Briggs
is a total badass, huh?

10:02.340 --> 10:03.907
[laughing]

10:03.951 --> 10:05.256
Oh, hey, Captain.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.910
Figured I'd find you
still here.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.346
Get yourself together.

10:08.390 --> 10:09.521
Come meet me
in Battalion in 30.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.524
Does that mean
you're gonna make the call?

10:14.048 --> 10:16.050
Hey, Captain, all the guys
talk shit about you,

10:16.093 --> 10:17.486
but I always knew
you had a heart of gold,

10:17.529 --> 10:19.009
and I was like,
"Not my captain.

10:19.836 --> 10:20.837
No."

10:22.360 --> 10:23.753
["Cut Em In"
playing on car stereo]

10:34.982 --> 10:36.244
-What's up, man?
-Howdy.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.074
Thank you.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.424
-[music stops]
-It's expired, sir.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.252
Oh, come on, man.

10:44.295 --> 10:45.949
You know how many times
I've been in and out
of this gate with that?

10:46.733 --> 10:48.517
Excuse me?

10:48.560 --> 10:50.737
Okay, think about it.
What's the odds I'm ISIS?

10:52.260 --> 10:54.479
Step out of the vehicle, sir.

10:54.523 --> 10:55.742
You want me to step out
of the vehicle...

10:55.785 --> 10:57.091
-Hey.
-...I'll happily...

10:57.134 --> 10:58.222
He's with
the Ranger battalion.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.572
[gasps] Ranger battalion.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.489
You're required
to dispose of this.

11:04.533 --> 11:05.882
What did you say?
I'm sorry, what?

11:09.016 --> 11:10.670
Thank you for your service.

11:10.713 --> 11:13.107
Energetically will I meet
the enemies of my country!

11:13.150 --> 11:15.457
[soldiers repeating in unison]

11:15.500 --> 11:17.720
I shall defeat them
on the field of battle!

11:17.764 --> 11:19.722
[soldiers repeating]

11:19.766 --> 11:22.203
-For I am better trained.
-[soldiers repeating]

11:22.246 --> 11:23.465
And will fight
with all my might!

11:23.508 --> 11:25.206
[soldiers repeating]

11:25.249 --> 11:26.598
[officer] Surrender
is not a Ranger word.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.513
[soldiers repeating]

11:28.557 --> 11:30.211
[officer] I'll never leave
a fallen comrade...

11:30.254 --> 11:31.778
What? Y'all gave away
my parking spot.

11:31.821 --> 11:33.518
I had to walk all the way
from the DFAC.

11:33.562 --> 11:35.085
-Keep pushing.
-Where are y'all headed?

11:35.129 --> 11:37.479
We're wheels down in Syria
in 24 hours.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.437
C-17 is loading up
as we speak.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.004
[Briggs] Look, sir,
I really appreciate this,

11:41.048 --> 11:42.484
I ain't gonna let you down.

11:42.527 --> 11:43.790
I've been working
the last three years

11:43.833 --> 11:44.878
to get it straight
for this job.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.357
That's what I like to hear.

11:46.401 --> 11:47.794
Kennelo, what did I say about

11:47.837 --> 11:49.534
using your mom's weights?
Like...

11:49.578 --> 11:50.884
I'm trying to look good
for your mom.

11:50.927 --> 11:52.581
Well, I'm just trying
to say, just...

11:52.624 --> 11:53.930
I don't know, more quads.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.323
Gonna give you a baby brother.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.761
So what do you gotta do?
Interview me or something

11:58.805 --> 12:00.937
to make sure I've got
a brain cell left, or...

12:00.981 --> 12:02.722
Yeah, something like that.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.724
[chuckling] Well, you say,
"Jump," I say, "How high?"

12:06.160 --> 12:07.378
Wait, isn't your office
this way?

12:07.422 --> 12:08.553
[Jones] Sure is.

12:12.035 --> 12:13.776
Riley's stuff
just about ready, Kiernan?

12:13.820 --> 12:15.212
Just about, sir.

12:16.213 --> 12:17.214
You good, man?

12:18.476 --> 12:20.261
[sighs] Yeah, man.
It is what it is.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.002
[Briggs] Yeah.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.570
Riley was about as solid
as they come.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.485
Tell that to the tree
he hit doin' 120.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.618
[Jones] All right, Kiernan,
let's go, come on.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.404
[Briggs] What's gonna
happen to his dog?

12:33.448 --> 12:35.189
Thought you'd never ask.

12:35.232 --> 12:37.017
Family funeral's Sunday
outside of Nogales.

12:38.061 --> 12:40.281
She's the guest of honor.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.457
Oh, that's...
That's a genius idea.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.285
I hope she doesn't
eat everybody first.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.766
[chuckles softly]
Well, that part will be
up to you.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.161
Wait, wait, what?

12:51.205 --> 12:53.381
-[dogs barking]
-[man shouting indistinctly]

12:55.165 --> 12:57.080
[Jones] We sent Riley's body
off late last night.

12:57.124 --> 12:59.779
And his mother called this
morning. She wants his hero dog
at the funeral.

12:59.822 --> 13:02.085
Sir, are you asking me to fly
a damn dog to Arizona?

13:02.129 --> 13:04.174
No, I'm asking you
to drive a Ranger to Arizona.

13:04.218 --> 13:05.480
She refuses to fly.

13:05.523 --> 13:08.091
Why ain't she deploying
with you?

13:08.135 --> 13:10.311
Won't work with anyone. One
minute she's good, the next
minute, she's sending three guys
to the ER.

13:10.354 --> 13:14.097
Riley kept trying
after you guys got blown up,
but she's gone all the way.

13:14.141 --> 13:17.057
Maybe Riley should have thought
of that before he broke the
speed of sound into a tree.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.581
- Yeah, well,
Rangers find a way to die.
- Hold on,
let me get this straight,

13:19.624 --> 13:21.844
so I agree to do this,
and you're gonna call
Black Canopy

13:21.888 --> 13:25.152
-and get my packet pushed.
-You do this, and then I make
the call, no screw-ups,

13:25.195 --> 13:28.242
nothing gets back to me. After
the service, you drop off on
base down at White Sands,

13:28.285 --> 13:29.765
they'll handle the rest.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.419
White Sands? So they're just
gonna put her down anyway.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.856
There's not a handler or a PD
crazy enough to adopt her up.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.467
Doesn't make us feel warm
and fuzzy inside.
Just is what it is.

13:36.511 --> 13:40.558
How about I disappear her ass,
you make the call, and we both
go on with our lives? How about
that?

13:40.602 --> 13:43.518
You stick your neck out for
Battalion, I'll stick mine out
for you.

13:43.561 --> 13:45.259
-Take it or leave it.
-Sir...

13:47.609 --> 13:49.437
Ready to pick up
your furry flash-bang?

13:49.480 --> 13:50.699
[Briggs]
That's what I'm told, man.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.614
[Jones]
Here's the deal, Briggs,

13:52.657 --> 13:54.659
this isn't the same dog
you served with,

13:54.703 --> 13:57.010
she's got every combat trigger
in the book.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.663
So you keep her secured

13:58.707 --> 13:59.926
and you don't take her out
in public.

14:02.493 --> 14:03.668
We clear?

14:06.933 --> 14:08.717
All right.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.111
If anyone asks, say she's
on her way to rehabilitation.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.680
Hey, do you want me
to leash her up for you?

14:15.724 --> 14:17.204
No, let's just
get this over with.

14:17.247 --> 14:18.248
All right.

14:22.905 --> 14:23.645
What's up, dog?

14:25.777 --> 14:26.474
You remember me?

14:27.127 --> 14:28.519
[growls softly]

14:28.563 --> 14:30.478
Your favorite chew toy
from 2015.

14:33.046 --> 14:35.091
Huh?

14:35.135 --> 14:36.701
Me and you are gonna go
on a little road trip.

14:36.745 --> 14:37.877
[dog panting]

14:37.920 --> 14:39.791
[Briggs] Fifteen hundred miles.

14:39.835 --> 14:42.316
Just to act like your daddy's
looking down on us from above.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.319
All right, I'm gonna
leash you up.

14:46.015 --> 14:46.973
All right?

14:48.322 --> 14:50.411
Be cool. Easy.

14:51.803 --> 14:52.543
Easy.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.637
You really did give up, huh?

14:59.681 --> 15:01.901
What are y'all so scared of?
She's milding out big-time.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.294
-[groans]
-[laughter]

15:04.338 --> 15:05.382
[Briggs] Stop!

15:06.644 --> 15:08.472
Enough!

15:08.516 --> 15:10.126
Hey, man, I forgot to
tell you not to touch her
on the ears, man.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.519
I left that part out.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.956
[barking and whining]

15:14.000 --> 15:15.523
[man] Hey, we weaned
her off the Prozac,

15:15.566 --> 15:17.307
so she might get moody
from time to time.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.005
Her muzzle can only stay on

15:19.048 --> 15:20.832
for about two hours at a time
or she'll overheat.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.530
Make sure you put water
in her food,

15:22.573 --> 15:24.140
and as you know,
don't touch her ears.

15:24.184 --> 15:25.533
Other than that,
here's your Bible.

15:25.576 --> 15:26.926
-Have a good trip.
-See you, Trent.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.711
[barking]

15:29.754 --> 15:31.452
Thank you, sir.

15:31.495 --> 15:32.714
All the belongings in
Sergeant Rodriguez's backpack

15:32.757 --> 15:34.063
go to his family.

15:34.107 --> 15:35.673
They want his uniform
at the funeral.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.153
The "I Love Me" book,
that stays with Lulu.

15:37.197 --> 15:39.808
If you have any trouble,
all her info's in there.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.331
I'm not gonna be out there
long enough.

15:41.375 --> 15:44.204
-Hey.
-Rangers lead the way, sir.

15:44.247 --> 15:45.335
-All the way.
-[Lulu barking]

15:50.906 --> 15:52.603
-[man 1] Good luck.
-[Briggs] All right, boys.

15:52.647 --> 15:53.996
[man 2] Looks like Briggs
finally got a girl.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.435

-This is Dorith.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.637
Hey, Dorith,
this is Jackson Briggs again.

16:26.681 --> 16:27.899
I was just calling
to let you guys know

16:27.943 --> 16:29.510
that I only fly business class

16:29.553 --> 16:31.642
to countries with names
that end in "stan."

16:31.686 --> 16:33.427
Sir, we're still missing
your recommendation.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.168
Uh, look, it's actually
what I was callin' about.

16:35.211 --> 16:36.299
-[whining]
-So, first thing

16:36.343 --> 16:37.909
Monday morning, uh,

16:37.953 --> 16:39.476
you'll be getting a call
from Captain Luke Jones

16:39.520 --> 16:41.261
from Second Ranger Battalion.

16:41.304 --> 16:43.045
If we hear from your captain
before Wednesday,

16:43.089 --> 16:44.829
I'll let the RSO know

16:44.873 --> 16:46.614
-to expect you on rotation.
-[whining and barking]

16:46.657 --> 16:48.311
Yes, ma'am, I'm very, very
happy to be working with...

16:48.355 --> 16:50.052
-[continues barking]
-Yes, sir, I can't hear you...

16:50.096 --> 16:52.054
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am,
thank you so much. I... Okay.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.273
[Lulu barking]

16:53.316 --> 16:54.317
[Briggs] What?

16:56.276 --> 16:58.060
[frustratedly]
What is your deal, man?

16:58.104 --> 17:00.497
-Come on.
-[whines]

17:00.541 --> 17:02.325
You're just slobbering
all over my seat.

17:02.369 --> 17:05.067
[barking and whining]

17:05.111 --> 17:06.851
Maybe just take
the crazy down.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.984
-Just like one notch.
-[Lulu whining]

17:09.028 --> 17:11.813
Just one notch, that's it,
and maybe we could get along.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.597
-[whines]
-And if we get along,

17:13.641 --> 17:15.295
maybe we could
even have some fun

17:15.338 --> 17:16.905
and send Riley off right.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.559
-[whining]
-Doesn't that sound nice, dog?

17:20.648 --> 17:23.477

-It's just me.

17:28.351 --> 17:30.614
keep you all muzzled up 24/7.

17:30.658 --> 17:32.355
I really don't.

17:32.399 --> 17:34.662
And to be honest,
I don't wanna drive

17:34.705 --> 17:36.968
straight to some
dry-ass desert town

17:37.012 --> 17:40.320

Come on, man. Okay,
okay, fine, fine, fine, fine.

17:47.544 --> 17:50.243
All right. So I gotta
take your muzzle off,

17:50.286 --> 17:52.071
but if you bite me,

17:52.114 --> 17:53.724
I'm gonna leave it on
all the way to Arizona.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.987

-So be chill,

17:56.031 --> 17:58.120

Easy. Do not bite me
in the face, all right?

18:10.524 --> 18:12.134
I'm gonna reach up,

18:12.178 --> 18:14.745
I'm not gonna touch your ears,

I'm not touchin' that,
I'm not touchin' that.

good, we're good. Okay, look at
that. We did it, we did it.

gonna let you have

19:50.276 --> 19:51.625

on this trip.

run and frolic,

and all that, but no,

is brutal this year.

You're just falling asleep
on me.

Wait, what'd you say?

and get some beers,
you're right.

Okay, I'll do that.

in a while.

but that's not the point.

did you realize

-Oh.

Tonight, I said to myself,
you're gonna love this,

22:48.105 --> 22:51.239
I said, "You will meet
a construction worker

22:51.282 --> 22:53.763
or a soldier."

22:53.807 --> 22:56.287
-That's interesting.
-Or, I don't know,

a white savior complex.

the help that you need.

-Thanks for the drink.
-No, no. Look, look,

by the Taliban.

23:10.693 --> 23:11.694
Hey.

23:14.044 --> 23:16.960
We gotta get outta here

23:17.004 --> 23:20.181
because you are about the
only woman in this entire city
that I would actually like to
have a conversation with.

23:20.224 --> 23:21.400
-[pouring liquid]
-Here,

23:21.443 --> 23:23.576
this is a peace offering.

23:23.619 --> 23:26.056
Be chill, and I'll be chill
with you. Here.

23:29.103 --> 23:30.887
Look, I didn't want
to drug you.

23:30.931 --> 23:32.759
You didn't have to eat my
seats, that's all I'm saying.

23:32.802 --> 23:35.414
We can be friends, but this is
gonna be an eye for an eye.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.850
-Are we gonna be cool?
-[whining]

23:36.893 --> 23:38.199
Or do we need to have
another meeting of the mind?

23:38.242 --> 23:39.679
[growling]

23:39.722 --> 23:41.681
Fine, you don't wanna
trust me, fine.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.247
I don't even care.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.728
I definitely don't trust you,
so whatever.

23:47.861 --> 23:49.079
Is that a Belgian Mal?

23:50.820 --> 23:52.996
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it is.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.911
-She's beautiful.
-Hi, sweet girl.

23:54.955 --> 23:56.739
-Are you a rescue?
-[Briggs] Uh, sort of.

23:56.783 --> 23:58.088
[woman 1] Does she like
other dogs?

23:58.132 --> 23:59.786
-[woman 2] Oh, yeah.
-No, um, no, no.

23:59.829 --> 24:02.528
Actually she's, um,
she's a little sad right now.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.747
She's... She's, um, grieving.

24:04.791 --> 24:07.010
She lost her best friend.

24:07.054 --> 24:09.099
[woman 1] Oh, no, sweetheart.

24:09.143 --> 24:11.450
I know. Who are...
Who are these little cuties?

24:11.493 --> 24:13.626
-Oh, this is Lucy.
-This is Maggie.

24:13.669 --> 24:15.454
Aw, they're so cute.

24:15.497 --> 24:16.498
-[woman 1] They're Shih Tzus.
-They're great.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.326
Oh, I love Shih Tzus.

24:18.369 --> 24:19.936
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.764
Mmm-hmm. Cheers.

24:21.808 --> 24:23.549
I was about to give up on
this city before I met y'all.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.986
Well, Portland's not
for everybody.

24:26.029 --> 24:27.770
I don't know,
it's growin' on me.

24:27.814 --> 24:32.296
It's not every day you meet
two plant musician ladies.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.168
[women chuckling]

24:34.211 --> 24:36.649
We're actually
Tantrikas.Um...

24:36.692 --> 24:38.302
-Okay.
-Yeah.

24:38.346 --> 24:40.783
We DJ ecstatic dance circles
sometimes, though.

24:40.827 --> 24:42.568
That's sick. Is that, like...
That's like yoga?

24:42.611 --> 24:45.701
I've done yoga.
But I'm horrible at it.

24:45.745 --> 24:48.095
We help heal people
by moving blocked energy

24:48.138 --> 24:49.531
so they can experience

24:49.575 --> 24:51.664
the full potential
of sexual pleasure.

24:54.667 --> 24:55.668
Oh.

24:57.060 --> 24:59.367
So you just move
the energy for...

24:59.410 --> 25:00.977
Hell, yeah. I can...

25:01.021 --> 25:02.936
I mean, I got... I got cash
in the truck, I think.

25:02.979 --> 25:04.415
[chuckles] Oh, no, no.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.942
No, the attraction
is completely genuine.

25:10.378 --> 25:11.727
Ah. I mean...

25:11.771 --> 25:13.120
As long as
it's in the flow for you.

25:14.687 --> 25:16.384
No, I'm good.

25:16.427 --> 25:17.690
-Kidding.
-[women laughing]

25:17.733 --> 25:19.953
I'm so in...
I'm so in the flow.

25:21.563 --> 25:22.303
[whines]

25:25.436 --> 25:28.135
[panting and whining]

25:28.178 --> 25:30.093
Great, I love some
chakrastuff.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.573
Do we smoke that or...

25:31.617 --> 25:32.400
-No.
-No?

25:36.578 --> 25:38.972
-This is... This is rad.
-[shushing]

25:39.015 --> 25:40.103
[Lulu barking in distance]

25:40.147 --> 25:41.583
Does your baby wanna come in?

25:41.627 --> 25:43.585
Nope, she's good,
she's just happy.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.021
She's a happy...
That's a happy bark.

25:45.065 --> 25:46.327
She's just letting me know.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.590
How are our hearts
in this moment?

25:48.634 --> 25:50.418
[whining and barking]

25:55.379 --> 25:57.164
Mmm, my heart is, um...

25:59.253 --> 26:01.342
just full and it's like...

26:02.256 --> 26:03.649
I mean, I got a new job.

26:04.475 --> 26:08.218
Yeah, uh, things are
really looking up.

26:08.262 --> 26:09.916
I just feel solid.
I feel solid over here,

26:09.959 --> 26:10.960
I'm ready to go.

26:12.309 --> 26:15.051
-Um, I'm not quite there yet.
-Okay.

26:15.095 --> 26:16.792
-Hmm.
-Okay.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.881
But maybe yab-yum
would help move some prana.

26:18.925 --> 26:20.491
This is what my heart needed.

26:21.797 --> 26:23.930
-Yeah, let's go.
-Mmm.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.932
So good, right?

26:25.975 --> 26:28.587
[women sighing in unison]

26:30.284 --> 26:31.807
All right.

26:31.851 --> 26:33.504
May I have permission
to remove your shirt?

26:33.548 --> 26:36.595
Hell, ye...
I'm gonna remove it for you.

26:36.638 --> 26:39.032

Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

26:44.907 --> 26:46.692
-[barking]
-Why are you so upset?

26:46.735 --> 26:49.651
-Oh, poor baby.
-[whining and barking]

26:52.045 --> 26:53.046
Oh, my Buddha.

26:54.438 --> 26:57.616
Oh, no, no. That's, like,
some old army shit.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.008
Don't worry about that.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.140
-You guys...
-What's this from?

27:01.532 --> 27:03.186
I don't know. That one is...

27:03.230 --> 27:06.059
The big one's an AK round.

27:06.102 --> 27:09.105
Your body is in so much pain.
I'm so sorry, we had no idea.

27:09.149 --> 27:10.933
No, no, look, it's fine.

27:10.977 --> 27:14.807
It's fine.
Do I have permission
to remove your shirt?

27:14.850 --> 27:16.460
'Cause I wanna take care
of your heart.

27:16.504 --> 27:17.810
This is why we were
drawn together.

-What an asshole.

What?

27:26.253 --> 27:28.081
-Place my hand...
-Mmm-hmm.

27:28.124 --> 27:29.735
...wherever your pain
guides it.

27:31.258 --> 27:32.825
Yeah, I can do that.

27:32.868 --> 27:35.741
I like this plan.
Why don't we start here?

27:35.784 --> 27:37.830
-Let's get you out of here.
-[barking]

27:40.006 --> 27:42.312

-Okay, uh...
-I'm sorry. I can't, uh,

-I can't hold this pace.
-I'll go check on her,

27:45.968 --> 27:47.666
how about that?
I'll go check on her. Just...

27:47.709 --> 27:50.669
You stay right there
and you just keep the energy.

-Hey!

27:53.497 --> 27:54.716
Hey! What are you doing?

27:54.760 --> 27:56.587
Freeing that abused animal.

27:56.631 --> 27:58.851
You throw that rock and we're
about to see who's abused.

27:58.894 --> 28:00.722
Of course you threaten
violence, you redneck!

28:00.766 --> 28:02.506
[chuckles] Red... You're
the one with the rock, man.

28:02.550 --> 28:04.073
Just put it down
and walk away.

28:04.117 --> 28:05.509
-I promise you...
-Animals are people, too.

28:05.553 --> 28:06.946
-Okay...
-Let her out now or I will.

28:06.989 --> 28:08.556
-You understand...
-[woman 1] Are you okay?

-Oh, no. It's no big deal.

29:44.086 --> 29:46.219
[Briggs] Whatever happened
to you, dog, huh?

29:46.262 --> 29:48.090
Remember when Maretti died?

29:48.134 --> 29:51.311
Riley made us watch, like,
15 hours of Grey's Anatomy.

29:51.354 --> 29:53.269
Everybody was sitting around
and then you just came around

29:53.313 --> 29:55.619
with your fat head,
nuzzling everybody,

29:55.663 --> 29:57.447
being all cute,

See, you know,
that's the difference

30:07.544 --> 30:08.981
between you and I, though.

30:09.024 --> 30:10.852
You know that?

30:10.896 --> 30:12.811
Those brain doctors said
I'd be on disability

30:12.854 --> 30:13.855
for the rest of my life.

30:13.899 --> 30:15.683
Not your dad, though.

30:15.726 --> 30:17.598
Your dad, they just sent back
with no questions asked.

30:17.641 --> 30:19.165
They said I'd never
see straight,

30:19.208 --> 30:21.297
I'd have headaches
and if I got stressed out,

30:21.341 --> 30:23.734
that I'd have seizures and die
or some bullshit like that,

30:23.778 --> 30:25.824

seizure stopping me, do you?

got a choice in the matter,

34:09.482 --> 34:10.918
Hey, have you seen a dog?

34:10.961 --> 34:13.094
She's brown, she's, like,
running around,

34:13.138 --> 34:15.314
I don't know,
with crazy eyes, huh?

34:17.011 --> 34:18.360
[man] Tell me who you work for.

34:18.404 --> 34:20.014
[Briggs] Okay, look,

34:20.058 --> 34:22.886
[sighs] I'm obviously not
who you think I am.

34:22.930 --> 34:24.540
[man] I know
who the hell you are.

34:27.630 --> 34:29.893
Think you're the first
commando they sent up here?

34:29.937 --> 34:30.851
Take my strains?

34:33.201 --> 34:35.899
Look, old man, unless
you're willing to walk this

34:35.943 --> 34:37.075
till the end of the road,

34:37.118 --> 34:38.554
I highly suggest
you cut me loose

34:38.598 --> 34:40.165
and let me go find
my damn dog.

34:40.208 --> 34:42.123
[man] You got five minutes
to clear your head,

34:42.167 --> 34:43.081
or you can join her ass.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.692
[grunts and groans]

34:46.823 --> 34:48.608
[breathing heavily]

34:56.181 --> 34:57.704
[grunting]

35:01.142 --> 35:03.579
[groans and pants]

35:14.547 --> 35:15.287
-[zip tie snaps]
-[grunts]

35:20.857 --> 35:22.032
[pig grunting]

35:24.339 --> 35:25.340
[clatters]

35:36.525 --> 35:37.526
Hell, yeah.

35:49.625 --> 35:52.150
[man speaking indistinctly]

35:52.193 --> 35:53.934
Who the hell you think
you're talking to?

35:55.457 --> 35:56.763
We'll see about that.

35:58.591 --> 35:59.592
Bitch!

36:03.465 --> 36:04.771
[operatic music playing softly
on speakers]

36:33.626 --> 36:34.888
[man mumbling indistinctly]

36:39.066 --> 36:40.850
Oh, that is...
That's bullshit.

36:42.112 --> 36:43.418
[man speaking indistinctly]

36:43.462 --> 36:46.116
[softly] Dog, come here,
come here.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.683
-[Lulu panting]
-[whispers] Now! Come here!

36:47.727 --> 36:49.207
Come here!

36:53.167 --> 36:55.038
[woman] Gus, is he awake yet?

36:55.082 --> 36:56.649
[Gus] Wide awake.
He's zip-tied in the barn.

36:56.692 --> 36:58.085
[woman] Zip-tied? Oh, my God.

36:58.128 --> 36:59.869
What the hell
did you do to him?

36:59.913 --> 37:02.045
[Gus] Some shit.
I told him I killed his dog.

37:02.089 --> 37:03.830
[woman] Gus, what do you know
about interrogation?

37:03.873 --> 37:05.484
You were
a conscientious objector.

37:05.527 --> 37:07.312
[Gus] How about a little
damn appreciation?

37:07.355 --> 37:10.097
[woman] I told you not to hit
those edibles so hard.

37:10.140 --> 37:12.273
Cartel? You paranoid maniac.

37:12.317 --> 37:13.796
-Tell him you're...
-[Gus] You're crazy, I'm not...

37:13.840 --> 37:15.842
...a scared old fool
who needs heavy therapy.

37:15.885 --> 37:17.191
Just tell him you're sorry.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.975
[Gus] I shot him
with a tranquilizer.

37:19.019 --> 37:20.847
[woman] I don't care
what you did.
[Gus] I pushed him...

37:20.890 --> 37:22.414
.[woman] Now you're making me
upset this little nugget.
-[panting]

37:23.850 --> 37:25.330
This perfect noodle...
[mumbling]

37:25.373 --> 37:27.332
[Gus] Listen, let's get
the hell out of here.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.508
[woman] 'Cause I wanna look
at your little, little paw.

37:29.551 --> 37:31.118
You're so good.

37:31.161 --> 37:32.424
So good.

37:32.467 --> 37:33.860
-So good.
-[Lulu grunts softly]

37:33.903 --> 37:35.035
[woman] What a little nugget.

37:38.299 --> 37:39.605
-[woman] Honey...
-Look, Jesus, I...

37:39.648 --> 37:40.606
[Briggs] Shut up.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.303
Sit down.

37:46.351 --> 37:47.308
Uh...

37:51.660 --> 37:53.140
How'd you make her
eat out of your hand?

37:53.662 --> 37:54.881
[Lulu whining]

37:56.361 --> 37:58.319
I didn't make her
do anything.

37:58.363 --> 37:59.102
I just talked to her.

38:00.365 --> 38:02.280
By the way, you can do
anything you like

38:02.323 --> 38:03.672
with my idiot husband.

38:05.108 --> 38:06.719
Gus, apologize.

38:08.155 --> 38:10.679
[hesitates] Sorry, dude.
My bad, my bad.

38:17.425 --> 38:19.949
[Lulu whining and panting]

38:19.993 --> 38:21.777
[woman] Hmm, see,
she's just a noodle.

38:21.821 --> 38:23.431
She just needs some good...

38:23.475 --> 38:25.346
I'm just going to touch her
little, little paw.

38:25.390 --> 38:27.348
Is she gonna be okay?

38:27.392 --> 38:29.568
Well, I'm worried she may
have broken her foot,

38:29.611 --> 38:31.961
but I'm gonna try my best.

38:32.005 --> 38:34.094
You need to give, um...
What is her name?

38:34.137 --> 38:35.138
Lulu.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.662
Lulu and I some space.

38:36.705 --> 38:38.403
So, um, here.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.579
Come on.
Gus, make yourself useful

38:40.622 --> 38:42.494
and get this man
some clean clothes

38:42.537 --> 38:44.757
because he's really
smelling strongly

38:44.800 --> 38:46.367
of Boris and his friends.

38:46.411 --> 38:48.587
So here, take some
homemade edibles.

38:48.630 --> 38:50.806
Go make friends, okay?

38:53.026 --> 38:55.768
Guys, come on, stop it.
Get outside.

38:55.811 --> 38:57.117
[Gus] You can't tell me that

38:57.160 --> 38:58.988
you did this
with a damn shoestring.

38:59.032 --> 39:00.207
[Briggs] You just gotta
compromise the plastic.

39:00.250 --> 39:01.513
That's it. [chuckles]

39:01.556 --> 39:04.211
Listen, I'm a lot better
at permaculture

39:04.254 --> 39:05.386
than I am tying dudes up.

39:06.605 --> 39:09.564
I need to know, man,
how close was I to...

39:09.608 --> 39:11.784
-Dying?
-Yeah.

39:11.827 --> 39:14.003
Pretty...
Pretty close, actually.
I almost put an axe
in the back of your head.

39:14.047 --> 39:15.527
[sighs]

39:15.570 --> 39:17.877
[hesitates] This is...
Well done.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.400
-Yeah, right? Right?
-Hmm.

39:19.444 --> 39:22.011
I'm just glad
you love that dog so much.

39:22.055 --> 39:24.231
I don't love that dog.
It's not even my dog.

39:24.274 --> 39:25.841
Come on, get on your back.

39:25.885 --> 39:27.190
Get on your back,
you can do it.

39:27.234 --> 39:28.801
-Come on.
-[Gus] Whose damn dog

39:28.844 --> 39:29.584
-Is it?
-[zip tie snaps]

39:30.193 --> 39:33.371
[both cheering]

39:33.414 --> 39:34.546
[Briggs] Look, you see that?

39:34.589 --> 39:37.375
-You see this?
-[Gus] Yeah.

39:37.418 --> 39:39.072
[Briggs] This is how they teach
them to attract the enemy.
They can smell their clothes
from, like, a mile off.

39:39.899 --> 39:42.815
Is this two dead dudes?

39:42.858 --> 39:44.294
[Briggs laughs]

39:44.338 --> 39:45.861
Yeah. Those are...
That's two Taliban,

39:45.905 --> 39:48.081
uh, dope farmers right there.

39:48.124 --> 39:49.648
Oh, don't look
all shocked, man.

39:49.691 --> 39:51.258
It's war.
It's not all unicorns

39:51.301 --> 39:53.042
and rainbow vaginas
out there, right?

39:53.695 --> 39:56.002
Yeah, I bet.

39:56.045 --> 40:00.136
So why do they call it
I Love Me book?

40:00.180 --> 40:01.921
I don't know.
Uh, but in the army,

40:01.964 --> 40:03.662
they just,
they make us all keep one.

40:03.705 --> 40:06.229
They make us put every single,
last stupid detail in.

40:08.884 --> 40:11.670
So, Lulu's greatest hits.
This is like...

40:11.713 --> 40:13.585
Like her music.
Like, music she...

40:13.628 --> 40:16.370
No, no, no, no, no.
It's the other greatest hits,

40:16.414 --> 40:18.067
you know.

40:18.111 --> 40:20.200
[chuckles] Like,
it's her bodycam footage.

40:20.243 --> 40:21.680
-Oh, Jesus.
-Yeah.

40:21.723 --> 40:22.550
It's the...
[imitates gunshots] kinda...

40:22.594 --> 40:24.465
Yeah, I'll pass.

40:24.509 --> 40:25.858
So let me get this right, man.

40:25.901 --> 40:28.687
So, like, the dog
did all this, man.

40:28.730 --> 40:30.036
I mean, they're just
going to put her down?

40:32.212 --> 40:34.867
Look, don't get all
misty-eyed on me, big man.

40:34.910 --> 40:36.869
Like, it's...
It's not like that.

40:36.912 --> 40:40.176
That dog did exactly
what she was born to do,

40:40.220 --> 40:42.657
and that was to live
a legendary life.

40:43.528 --> 40:44.311
And she did it.

40:47.749 --> 40:48.707
What the hell is this here?

40:49.577 --> 40:51.144
"Dear Lulu,

40:51.187 --> 40:53.363
I can hardly imagine life
before I knew you.

40:53.407 --> 40:56.497
Did you come into this world
a beast of fury,

40:56.541 --> 40:58.630
-or were you just..."
-What was that? What was that?

40:58.673 --> 41:00.632
He wrote... It's like written
up on top right there.

41:00.675 --> 41:02.503
There's a couple of 'em,

41:02.547 --> 41:04.940
like poems or love letters,
or something.

41:04.984 --> 41:08.466
Rodriguez could barely spell.

41:08.509 --> 41:11.120
I mean, he definitely
can't rhyme.

41:11.164 --> 41:13.035
I know what this is.
This is...

41:13.079 --> 41:14.515
So when you have
a brain injury,

41:14.559 --> 41:17.126
you basically get sent
to these brain doctors.

41:17.170 --> 41:20.390
And then they study you,
and they make you draw

41:20.434 --> 41:22.654
and write and do
all this art therapy bullshit.

41:22.697 --> 41:24.525
Nobody really
takes it serious.

41:24.569 --> 41:25.570
-Shit!
-Oh!

41:25.613 --> 41:26.875
-[woman laughs]
-Dog!

41:26.919 --> 41:28.529
-You're okay. Hey.
-[Lulu barking]

41:28.573 --> 41:30.226
Look at her.
She's running around.

41:30.270 --> 41:32.533
Yeah. There was just
a little piece of barbed wire

41:32.577 --> 41:34.361
just lodged way up in her paw.

41:34.404 --> 41:36.319
I sterilized it
and stopped the bleeding.

41:36.363 --> 41:37.930
Never seen a dog so strong.

41:37.973 --> 41:39.975
Thank you. Thank you so much.

41:40.019 --> 41:42.500
Also, she did offer me
a transmission.

41:42.543 --> 41:45.154
-If you feel called.
-Transmission?

41:45.198 --> 41:47.722
Yeah, she bats
about 350 on those.

41:47.766 --> 41:49.463
I mean, but, you know,

41:49.507 --> 41:52.161
if it was baseball,
it'd be hall of fame numbers.

41:53.772 --> 41:55.338
[woman] Wow.

41:55.382 --> 41:57.906
You two are definitely
karmically connected.

41:59.255 --> 42:01.127
She must have incarnated
to find you.

42:02.389 --> 42:04.043
I'm seeing pyramids.

42:06.045 --> 42:07.916
Ancient Egypt.

42:07.960 --> 42:10.397
Now, a young girl,
she's playing.

42:10.440 --> 42:12.051
[chuckles] Oh, she's so happy.

42:12.834 --> 42:14.140
Does Lulu work with kids?

42:14.793 --> 42:15.968
Uh, wow.

42:16.011 --> 42:18.144
Yeah. She loves kids.

42:18.187 --> 42:19.449
She loves 'em.

42:19.493 --> 42:21.190
-Oh.
-And licks their faces

42:21.234 --> 42:23.105
-right off.
-[Gus] Unbelievable.

42:23.845 --> 42:25.543
I think it might be

42:27.806 --> 42:28.807
your daughter.

42:31.113 --> 42:32.550
Does she have a boy's name?

42:34.290 --> 42:36.597
-A boy's name?
-Uh, Sam.

42:36.641 --> 42:38.251
[Gus] Oh.

42:38.294 --> 42:40.645
Um, what about my daughter?

42:40.688 --> 42:44.039
Well, Lulu, she's bringing her
into my awareness.

42:44.083 --> 42:45.040
How old is she?

42:45.519 --> 42:46.999
Uh, three.

42:47.042 --> 42:48.435
Let's... Let's just keep it
about the dog.

42:49.654 --> 42:50.959
[woman] Okay.

42:51.003 --> 42:53.135
[hesitates] I'm feeling cold.

42:53.962 --> 42:56.965
[inhales deeply] Hard, yes.

42:57.009 --> 42:59.489
She's yearning for soft.

42:59.533 --> 43:01.187
Yes, a bed.

43:02.623 --> 43:05.452
A luxury mattress. [chuckles]

43:05.495 --> 43:07.802
She says she's never slept
in a nice bed before.

43:07.846 --> 43:09.238
She asks if it's okay.

43:09.282 --> 43:10.762
-She's asking me that?
-[woman] Mmm.

43:10.805 --> 43:13.808
Okay, yeah, sure.

43:13.852 --> 43:16.681
Now I'm getting hot...
Tongue... Taste.

43:17.507 --> 43:18.857
Yes.

43:18.900 --> 43:20.685
-Indian food she wants?
-[Gus] Oh!

43:20.728 --> 43:23.035
Are you kidding me?

43:23.078 --> 43:24.993
-Gus.
-Strike three.

43:25.037 --> 43:27.082
Gus, why do you undermine me?

43:27.126 --> 43:29.607
[Gus] The damn dog
don't want Indian food.

43:29.650 --> 43:33.219
["Turtles All the Way Down"
playing]

43:36.614 --> 43:37.745
[Briggs] I'm so happy we didn't
have to kill

43:37.789 --> 43:39.442
those nice people.

43:39.486 --> 43:41.140
But I'm just saying,
if we did,

43:41.183 --> 43:43.055
you were definitely digging
the bigger hole

43:43.098 --> 43:44.926
'cause Gus was massive.

43:44.970 --> 43:46.406
And by the way, the next time
you smell weed,

43:46.449 --> 43:47.886
don't run away,
just let me know,

43:47.929 --> 43:49.191
and we can go get it together.

43:49.235 --> 43:51.193
-Hey, hey, hey! No, no!
-[barking]

43:51.237 --> 43:53.761
[groans] Why, man?

43:53.805 --> 43:55.241
Hey, dog!

44:04.511 --> 44:06.644
-No, no, no, no, no, no!
-[growling]

44:06.687 --> 44:08.471
Stop it! No, no!

44:08.515 --> 44:10.299
-This is my unicorn.
-[Lulu barking]

44:17.567 --> 44:19.918
-No, no, no, no, no. Stop!
-[dogs barking]

44:19.961 --> 44:23.661
Stop it. Okay, all right,
come on, come on. Let's go.

44:23.704 --> 44:25.750
Let's go. Sorry, guys.

44:33.061 --> 44:35.498
[line ringing]

44:35.542 --> 44:38.719
Hey, it's Niki.
Leave a message.

44:41.722 --> 44:43.724
[Lulu barks]

44:44.943 --> 44:46.118
What are you looking at?

44:46.771 --> 44:47.902
[whining]

44:48.860 --> 44:50.122
What you whining for?

44:50.165 --> 44:51.297
You're the whole reason
we're up here.

44:54.779 --> 44:56.345
Get comfy.

44:56.389 --> 44:57.607
That's where
you're sleeping tonight.

44:58.565 --> 44:59.348
[sighs]

45:02.134 --> 45:03.135
[music stops]

45:05.790 --> 45:06.529
[Briggs] You're missing
your cage?

45:07.792 --> 45:10.751
Look. It's Alcatraz,
it's right there.

45:10.795 --> 45:12.535
Just take a little tour.

45:12.579 --> 45:14.363
You know,
possibly just leave you there.

45:16.061 --> 45:17.976
You only got about
three more days left

45:18.019 --> 45:20.021
on this green Earth,
so you better speak now

45:20.065 --> 45:21.327
or forever hold your peace.

45:22.807 --> 45:24.330
-[whines]
-Hey, look, ain't no shame

45:24.373 --> 45:26.071
in wanting a big,
comfy mattress, okay?

45:26.114 --> 45:27.594
Look, I get it. I get it.

45:27.637 --> 45:29.204
I've had three
back operations, so I get it.

45:29.248 --> 45:32.599
Comfort is king.
But the facts are this...

45:32.642 --> 45:34.383
They ain't letting two
rock eaters like me and you

45:34.427 --> 45:35.863
in some bougie-ass hotel.

45:35.907 --> 45:37.386
And I ain't about
that Holiday Inn life.

45:37.430 --> 45:38.953
But I got an idea.

45:38.997 --> 45:40.259
If you want that bed,

45:42.043 --> 45:43.741
we gotta go big,
or we gotta go home.

45:44.567 --> 45:45.743
Are you with me?

45:46.482 --> 45:47.875
Hey.

45:47.919 --> 45:50.660
-Are you in or are you out?
-[whines]

45:52.097 --> 45:53.359
I'm going to take that
as a yes.

45:54.621 --> 45:55.840
[panting]

45:55.883 --> 45:56.971
["San Francisco Blues" playing]

46:08.243 --> 46:09.636
Welcome to
the Grand Regal, sir.

46:09.679 --> 46:10.419
What up, cuz?

46:12.813 --> 46:13.814
[receptionist] Enjoy your stay.

46:13.858 --> 46:14.597
Thank you.

46:16.817 --> 46:17.557
[chuckles]

46:18.819 --> 46:21.474
Hi. Welcome to the
Grand Regal, sir.

46:21.517 --> 46:22.823
-Oh, hi, sorry.
-Hi.

46:22.867 --> 46:23.955
Are you checking in?

46:23.998 --> 46:25.434
Yes, please. I was...

46:25.478 --> 46:26.827
I was hoping, uh,
that you might have

46:26.871 --> 46:29.264
a room for me
and my little girl here.

46:29.308 --> 46:31.527
Oh, well,
let me check on that.

46:31.571 --> 46:33.965
Oh, is that a purple heart?
Was she wounded?

46:34.008 --> 46:35.967
-Uh...
-[whines]

46:37.142 --> 46:39.100
-Yes, she was.
-Oh.

46:39.144 --> 46:41.668
Thank you
for your service. Oh.

46:44.889 --> 46:47.674
[laughs] What did I say?
Right when we walked in,

46:47.717 --> 46:50.242
I said that, "Never in history

46:50.285 --> 46:51.896
has a blind veteran
and his hero dog

46:51.939 --> 46:54.246
walked into a hotel
and not gotten a free room."

46:54.289 --> 46:56.422
And why did I say that?

46:56.465 --> 46:57.989
Why did I say that happens
every time?

46:58.032 --> 46:59.599
-[panting]
-[gasps] Oh, you're right.

46:59.642 --> 47:02.689
Freedom. That is why
that happens. [chuckles]

47:02.732 --> 47:04.299
-Who's a genius?
-[panting]

47:04.343 --> 47:05.997
What... What's your...
What's your deal?

47:07.085 --> 47:08.913
Why are you... Are you hot?

47:08.956 --> 47:09.739
Do you want water?

47:10.653 --> 47:12.264
Huh?

47:12.307 --> 47:15.876
Let's get this vest off you.
Come on, get up, get up.

47:15.920 --> 47:16.921
Up! Come on.

47:17.922 --> 47:19.097
[sniffs]

47:19.140 --> 47:21.012
Oh, man, you stink.

47:21.055 --> 47:22.448
Okay, dog, here.

47:22.491 --> 47:23.753
Come on, let's get in.

47:23.797 --> 47:25.320
The water's fine.

47:25.364 --> 47:26.626
Come here. Come on. Let's go.

47:27.453 --> 47:29.150
Let's go. Come here.

47:29.194 --> 47:32.066
Come, come, come here.
Get in the tub.

47:33.154 --> 47:34.155
Come on, come on.

47:35.330 --> 47:36.331
Okay.

47:40.683 --> 47:42.685
[in a soft voice]
You good little nugget.

47:43.730 --> 47:45.471
Such a good little nugget.

47:46.298 --> 47:48.387
Come on, little nugget.

47:48.430 --> 47:51.259
Come on,
now get in the nugget bath.

47:51.303 --> 47:52.478
Good girl, come on.

47:53.261 --> 47:55.524
Come on. You're okay.

47:55.568 --> 47:57.526
-I'll dip you like a nugget.
-[whines]

47:57.570 --> 48:00.573
I don't want to kill you.
Mmm-mmm.

48:00.616 --> 48:02.923
-Yeah, good girl. Good girl.
-[whines]

48:02.967 --> 48:04.577
Good girl. Come on. Come on.

48:04.620 --> 48:06.709
Come on, yeah! Get in.
Come on, come on.

48:06.753 --> 48:08.059

-No, no, no, come here.

-[barks]
-It's all nice and warm.

48:10.975 --> 48:13.499
It's all nice and warm.
Yes, it is.

48:13.542 --> 48:15.109
Yes, it is!

48:15.153 --> 48:20.114
We went through four
bath bombs, bath salts.

48:20.158 --> 48:22.247
Should I call down to the spa
and get us a slot down there

48:22.290 --> 48:24.510
for a doggy massage? Yeah?

48:26.164 --> 48:27.600
You're definitely not the girl

48:27.643 --> 48:29.515
I thought I'd be
in the tub with, but, hey,

48:30.820 --> 48:32.300
you know,
I'll take what I can get

48:32.344 --> 48:33.911
at this point, I guess.

48:33.954 --> 48:35.477
All right.

48:35.521 --> 48:37.349
Last bit, all right?

48:38.393 --> 48:39.394
There we go.

48:41.570 --> 48:44.138
-[doorbell rings]
-One second. One Minute.

48:44.182 --> 48:45.009
Hold on, I'm coming.

48:47.620 --> 48:48.534
Yes, one second.

48:50.144 --> 48:53.147
Um, one second, yes.

48:53.191 --> 48:55.410
Coming.

48:55.454 --> 48:57.195
Good evening, sir.
Here with the room service.

48:57.238 --> 48:58.761
-Good evening.
-Oh, good evening.

48:58.805 --> 49:00.024
-May I come in, please?
-Yes, please.

49:00.067 --> 49:01.373
All right.
I can take the door.

49:01.416 --> 49:04.245
So we have one rib eye,
medium rare,

49:04.289 --> 49:05.943
and one Indian samosas.

49:05.986 --> 49:07.422
-Anything else?
-No.

49:07.466 --> 49:08.989
-Everything looks shipshape.
-All right.

49:09.033 --> 49:10.556
-Thank you very much.
-Have a good evening.

Hey, dog, you should
see this guy's face.

49:20.044 --> 49:22.133
[laughs] Hey! No!

49:22.176 --> 49:23.656
Get off! Get off there!

49:23.699 --> 49:25.005
Don't do it! Stop!

49:25.049 --> 49:27.007
No! No! You...

49:27.051 --> 49:29.705
Okay. You know what?
I didn't even care anyways.

49:29.749 --> 49:30.837
That was your bed.
'Cause I'm going out.

[whining]

49:34.536 --> 49:36.974
[TV playing indistinctly]

49:45.634 --> 49:48.072
Do I look like 200k a year
or what?

49:48.115 --> 49:51.249
Look at you, sitting on
the couch, looking all cute.

49:51.292 --> 49:53.555
Why didn't you tell me
all I had to do was just

49:53.599 --> 49:56.384
turn on the TV and put your
greatest hits on of you mauling
people, to get you to relax?

49:57.342 --> 49:59.039
[chuckles] You narcissist.

49:59.083 --> 50:01.520
What happened, no go
on the Indian food?

50:01.563 --> 50:02.564
I told you,
you can't trust psychics.

50:03.391 --> 50:05.306
But don't you worry.

50:05.350 --> 50:07.439
I got exactly what you want.

50:07.482 --> 50:11.008
Dry-aged, marbled-on-the-bone
beautifulness. Ready?

50:12.835 --> 50:14.620
Take it, savor it. Come on.

50:16.448 --> 50:18.232
You don't have to be scared.
Just take it out of my hand.

50:20.191 --> 50:21.192
Whatever.

50:26.458 --> 50:28.634
Do not do anything stupid.

-Hell, no.

50:41.777 --> 50:43.257
Oh, you think you're
coming with me?

50:43.301 --> 50:44.737
Do you think I forgot
about Portland?

50:44.780 --> 50:46.347
-[barks]
-No.

50:46.391 --> 50:47.522
I'll never forget
about Portland.

50:47.566 --> 50:49.263
-Ever.

-Wait. Who's that?
-Oh, we met at the front desk.

52:08.429 --> 52:09.996
-[Briggs] Oh, the... Yes.
-Callan.

[Briggs] Yes, Callan,
the front desk angel.

I'm looking for a place
to eat tonight.

52:13.173 --> 52:14.783
-Oh, there are...
-Any good recommendations?

52:14.827 --> 52:16.437
[Callan] Yes, there's
a fantastic oyster bar

52:16.481 --> 52:17.351
down at the Embarcadero.

52:17.395 --> 52:18.918
[Briggs] I love oysters.

52:18.961 --> 52:20.311
They really, you know,
heighten the senses.

-What time do you get off?
-[Lulu growling softly]

52:21.486 --> 52:22.965

time, take your time.

52:51.690 --> 52:52.821
Are you okay?

Take it easy, take it easy.

53:03.745 --> 53:05.791
Okay. Here we go, here we go.

53:09.490 --> 53:11.797
Oh, my God, I can...
I can see.

53:13.320 --> 53:16.105
I can see. Guys, I can see!

53:16.149 --> 53:17.585
[indistinct chatter]

53:20.632 --> 53:24.244
Hey, hey! Hey!

53:24.288 --> 53:27.073
[officer] So you were
impersonating a blind man

53:27.116 --> 53:30.032
as part of a seeing eye
dog training exercise?

53:30.076 --> 53:31.947
-[Briggs] Yep, that's right.
-Mmm-hmm.

53:31.991 --> 53:35.473
When suddenly, uh,
unbeknownst to you,

53:35.516 --> 53:38.127
um, your dog broke free
from your grasp,

53:38.171 --> 53:39.999
sprinted the entire length
of the lobby

53:40.042 --> 53:42.262
-and muzzle struck the victim?
-Correct.

53:42.306 --> 53:43.872
[officer] And you've never
seen this dog exhibit

53:43.916 --> 53:45.657
any type of aggressive
behavior before this?

53:45.700 --> 53:48.616
Never. Never. She usually...
She loves people.

53:48.660 --> 53:51.097
It's out of her character.
I really don't understand it.

53:51.140 --> 53:52.925
-Man, honestly, I'm in shock.
-[clicks tongue] Uh-huh.

53:55.014 --> 53:56.320
Is there anything else
you want to add?

53:56.363 --> 53:57.625
How is the guy?
Is he all right?

53:57.669 --> 53:59.061
-Yeah.
-He seemed okay.

53:59.105 --> 54:00.324
Well, we're gonna
be contacting

54:00.367 --> 54:02.935
Dr. Al-Farid in the morning.

54:02.978 --> 54:05.285
He wants to press charges.
We'll take it from there.

54:05.329 --> 54:08.157
Until then,
you just sit tight.

54:08.201 --> 54:10.072
[Briggs] Cool, and the dog?
Dog's okay?

54:10.116 --> 54:11.378
[officer] We're gonna
have to check

54:11.422 --> 54:12.901
with animal control
on that one.

54:12.945 --> 54:14.294
[Briggs] Okay.
So when do I get her back?

54:14.338 --> 54:16.165
Do I have to post bail
or whatever?

54:16.209 --> 54:18.951
[officer] Post bail?
Buddy, it is Friday night.

54:18.994 --> 54:21.432
Judge is not back
until Monday A.M.

54:21.475 --> 54:25.131
And I am required
to keep all suspects

54:25.174 --> 54:26.872
in possible hate crimes
in my custody.

54:26.915 --> 54:28.526
Hate crime?

54:28.569 --> 54:30.267
Now, don't start with me.
Take it to City Hall.

54:30.310 --> 54:31.964
Who said anything about a hate
crime? Wait, wait, wait.

54:32.007 --> 54:33.792
Hold on a second. Okay.
All right. Let me... Let me...

54:33.835 --> 54:34.793
Let me level with you, man.

54:36.098 --> 54:37.491
Okay? I was an Army Ranger.

54:38.710 --> 54:40.929
That dog's handler was
my buddy, and he passed.

54:40.973 --> 54:43.932
I got to take her down to his
funeral in Arizona on Sunday.

54:43.976 --> 54:46.500
I got a Gold Star family
that's just depending on me

54:46.544 --> 54:47.893
to get her there.

54:47.936 --> 54:49.329
All right?
Now I'll be back here

54:49.373 --> 54:50.896
first thing Monday morning.
I promise.

54:50.939 --> 54:52.332
I just... I got to...
I got to get her

54:52.376 --> 54:53.333
and I got to go tonight.

54:55.988 --> 54:57.163
You were an Army Ranger?

54:57.206 --> 54:58.904
-[Briggs] Yeah.
-[chuckles]

55:01.036 --> 55:02.211
Why the hell
didn't you say so?

55:03.691 --> 55:05.258
-I'm sorry.
-Instead of puttin' me through

55:05.302 --> 55:07.391
20 minutes of that Ray Charles
bullshit, huh?

55:07.434 --> 55:09.218
I was in the 202nd.

55:09.262 --> 55:10.350
Hey, buddy,
I gotta tell you something.

55:10.394 --> 55:11.830
And I gotta level with you.

55:11.873 --> 55:13.397
You going into that
hotel lobby, huh,

55:13.440 --> 55:15.399
with that damn cane
and those glasses, man.

55:15.442 --> 55:16.574
You Army Rangers,

55:16.617 --> 55:18.271
you've got balls of steel.

55:18.315 --> 55:19.881
-No. It was stupid.
-I'm a huge fan, seriously.

55:19.925 --> 55:21.143
Hey, I gotta ask
you something,
on the real, on the real.

55:23.102 --> 55:24.756
You sent that little beast
for that raghead, didn't ya?

55:25.496 --> 55:27.019
-What?
-Huh?

55:27.062 --> 55:28.890
Get a little payback for what
they took from us, right?

55:28.934 --> 55:30.501
-Right?
-No. I... No,

55:30.544 --> 55:32.372
-definitely, I didn't do that.
-Come on. Don't worry, man.

55:32.416 --> 55:34.200
My lips are sealed.
I'm not gonna say nothing.

55:34.243 --> 55:36.376
And us 31 Alphas,
we keep it tight.

55:36.420 --> 55:38.073
-You know?
-Alpha 31s?

55:38.117 --> 55:39.510
Yeah, we looked out for you
badasses real good.

55:40.424 --> 55:41.990
Out by the front gate, right?

55:42.817 --> 55:44.036
Oh, you were an MP.

55:44.079 --> 55:45.385
-Damn right.
-Right.

55:45.429 --> 55:46.865
What are you implying?

55:46.908 --> 55:48.954
Oh, no, no,
I'm not implying anything.

55:49.563 --> 55:51.783
No, I mean, we...

55:51.826 --> 55:55.264
You MPs, man,
you guys got a hard job.

55:55.308 --> 55:57.092
I never slept better
knowing that you guys

55:57.136 --> 55:58.746
were out there
at the guardhouse,

55:58.790 --> 56:00.400
on the wall, watching over us.

56:00.444 --> 56:02.402
Yeah, I appreciate
that, brother.

56:02.446 --> 56:04.012
Yeah, I appreciate it too
that you're not like

56:04.056 --> 56:06.145
all those other Army Rangers
that I've met.

56:06.188 --> 56:07.668
You know, with the long beards

56:07.712 --> 56:09.844
flowing in the wind,
like they were Moses?

56:09.888 --> 56:13.674
The car going right by the
front gate, not showin' an ID,

56:13.718 --> 56:16.155
flipping us off,
"Thank you for your service."

56:16.198 --> 56:17.417
Yeah, you're not one
of those guys, are you?

56:17.461 --> 56:18.853
-No, I...
-No, no, no.

56:18.897 --> 56:20.333
-No, I definitely...
-You know what?

56:20.377 --> 56:22.466
I buy that.
You know what else I buy?

56:22.509 --> 56:27.296
White military guy sics
his dog on a Muslim doctor

56:27.340 --> 56:29.821
in the heart of
woke-ing class America.

56:29.864 --> 56:31.431
[Briggs] Man, don't do this.

56:31.475 --> 56:33.651
Don't do this. Just let me
get my dog and go.

56:33.694 --> 56:35.000
Oh, now it's your dog!

56:37.132 --> 56:38.264
Sleep tight, bitch.

56:39.483 --> 56:40.614

56:50.102 --> 56:51.408

Line-up time.

56:56.804 --> 56:58.023
Step to the left.

57:00.504 --> 57:02.027
Really? A line-up?
It's like...

57:02.854 --> 57:04.333
It's me, right?

57:04.377 --> 57:06.248
[man] Everybody,
step to your right.

57:06.292 --> 57:08.599
What are we doing?
Did you guys even have dogs?

57:09.861 --> 57:11.819
He seems like a cat guy.

57:11.863 --> 57:13.473
- Quiet, number three.
- [over speakers]
We all know it was me, right?

57:13.517 --> 57:14.213
Yes, it was him.

57:15.040 --> 57:16.041
Face forward.

57:16.737 --> 57:18.260
It's him.

57:18.304 --> 57:19.958
I got it. Thank you, sir.

57:20.001 --> 57:22.439
Can I... Can I just, like...
You know what?

57:22.482 --> 57:24.136
I'm just gonna confess.
How about that?

57:24.179 --> 57:26.007
Step back, number three.

57:26.051 --> 57:27.748
No, I'm sorry. Can I confess?
Is that, like, a thing?

57:27.792 --> 57:29.228
Man, I've got lunch.

57:29.271 --> 57:30.751
It was my fault. I don't...

57:30.795 --> 57:32.536
Look, my dog,

57:32.579 --> 57:35.103
she was just doing
what she was trained to do.

57:35.147 --> 57:37.149
And unfortunately,
she was trained

57:37.192 --> 57:40.108
to attack guys that look
like Dr. Al-Farid.

57:40.152 --> 57:41.545
All right, that's enough,
number three.

57:41.588 --> 57:43.242
Wait, let him speak.

57:43.285 --> 57:44.678
There. But I'm sorry,
that is the truth.

57:44.722 --> 57:46.375
She served seven years,
eight deployments,

57:46.419 --> 57:49.117
but she did save more people
than you can count.

57:49.161 --> 57:51.076
I'm not some racist
piece of shit,

57:51.119 --> 57:52.730
but I'll confess to whatever
it is that you want me to

57:52.773 --> 57:54.383
or do whatever you want me to,

57:54.427 --> 57:56.516
as long as someone promises me

57:56.560 --> 57:59.084
that they will get her
to that funeral this Sunday.

57:59.127 --> 58:00.912
Is that a deal
that I can make?

58:02.783 --> 58:04.742
[scoffs] Give me a break.

58:04.785 --> 58:06.439
All right.
Take him out of here.

58:06.483 --> 58:08.267
-Really? Nothing.
-[man] Next group in five.

58:08.310 --> 58:10.008
That's it?

58:10.051 --> 58:11.270
[man] Hold on, number three.

58:18.059 --> 58:19.887
So you impersonated
a blind man

58:19.931 --> 58:21.323
just to get a free hotel room?

58:23.151 --> 58:24.849
Uh, yeah, yeah, I did.

58:24.892 --> 58:27.199
Um, there was a psychic

58:27.242 --> 58:28.635
and she said that
she wanted...

58:28.679 --> 58:30.550
My dog wanted a mat...
Like, a comfy mattress.

58:30.594 --> 58:31.899
And some... Never mind.

58:31.943 --> 58:33.118
It's... It's insane.

58:35.599 --> 58:36.730
It is insane.

58:37.644 --> 58:38.993
And if you want my

58:39.037 --> 58:40.125
non-clinical opinion,
so are you.

58:42.040 --> 58:43.128
Yeah, that's... That's fair.

58:45.086 --> 58:48.350
But the more I sit with it,
it's even more insane to

58:48.394 --> 58:51.310
leave my practice
and fly back from Boston

58:51.353 --> 58:53.312
just to prosecute a veteran

58:53.355 --> 58:54.835
trying to get his dog
to a funeral.

58:57.751 --> 58:59.448
Just promise,
when it's all done,

58:59.492 --> 59:00.972
you'll seek professional help.

59:03.409 --> 59:04.541
I, uh... Yes, sir.

59:06.194 --> 59:08.240
-Salaam.
-Salaam.

59:18.903 --> 59:22.080
-[Briggs] Hey, what's up, dog?
-[Lulu whining]

59:22.123 --> 59:25.213
What's up? How're you doing?

59:25.257 --> 59:27.389
Never thought I'd be
this excited to see you.

59:27.433 --> 59:29.174
Has she always panted so much?

59:29.217 --> 59:31.611
Yeah, she runs... She runs
hot, I guess, like me.

59:31.655 --> 59:33.352
She's not hot.

59:33.395 --> 59:35.963
That's anxiety.
It comes from trauma.

59:36.007 --> 59:37.312
You know,
she tried to bite my colleague

59:37.356 --> 59:39.314
when he lightly
touched her on the ears.

59:39.358 --> 59:41.621
Either take responsibility for
her or find someone who will.

59:41.665 --> 59:44.232
Okay, thank you.

59:50.151 --> 59:51.849
You're ready
to get out of here? Huh?

59:53.111 --> 59:55.461
Your personal effects.
Dismissed.

59:56.854 --> 59:59.334
As in, get out of my face.

59:59.378 --> 1:00:01.859
Did you hear the nice man?
We should get out of his face.

1:00:02.207 --> 1:00:03.208
Come on.

1:00:05.776 --> 1:00:07.081

you had a brother?

1:00:40.767 --> 1:00:42.247
And he lives in Los Angeles.

1:00:42.290 --> 1:00:43.683
We got something in common,
me and you.

1:00:43.727 --> 1:00:45.250
I got family
in that godforsaken city.

I'll make you a deal.

we can go see him.

too long in there,

you have full permission
to go psychotic,

1:05:02.246 --> 1:05:03.725
-Relax.
-[Briggs] Come on, come on.

1:05:03.769 --> 1:05:05.379
-Come on, we'll make it fun.
-[Lulu barking]

1:05:05.423 --> 1:05:07.207
It's fun. Take a little piece.

1:05:07.251 --> 1:05:08.600
Take a little piece.
I know you like it.

1:05:08.643 --> 1:05:10.819
-I know you want it.
-[panting]

1:05:10.863 --> 1:05:12.125
[barking]

1:05:12.169 --> 1:05:13.953
Remind me again
why we want her to bite.

1:05:13.997 --> 1:05:16.956
She doesn't know what war is.
For her, it's just work.

1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.089
You've got to show her
that work can be fun again,

1:05:19.132 --> 1:05:20.917
nothing bad
is going to happen, okay?

1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:22.527
That's how you make a bond.

1:05:22.570 --> 1:05:24.007
I don't need to make
a bond, okay?

1:05:24.050 --> 1:05:25.747
I just... What, am I not
fun enough for you?

1:05:25.791 --> 1:05:26.879
-You're fun.
-Come on.

1:05:26.923 --> 1:05:28.098
Just hold your arm up
a bit higher.

1:05:28.141 --> 1:05:29.534
It's up, man. Take it.

1:05:29.577 --> 1:05:30.970
-Come on, just get it.
-[Nuke barks]

1:05:31.014 --> 1:05:33.842
-Good boy, Nuke. Good boy!
-Good boy.

1:05:33.886 --> 1:05:35.583
Let him know
this is love, your chew toy,

1:05:35.627 --> 1:05:36.758
this is fun.

1:05:36.802 --> 1:05:39.674
Good boy, Nuke. Good boy.

1:05:39.718 --> 1:05:40.937
[Briggs] So you're
telling me that Nuke

1:05:40.980 --> 1:05:43.026
was just as messed up as Lulu.

1:05:43.069 --> 1:05:45.463
I'd been working every day
for six months

1:05:45.506 --> 1:05:48.379
before I convinced the army
to let me adopt him out.

1:05:48.422 --> 1:05:49.293
Thought we'd never get there.

1:05:50.250 --> 1:05:52.731
Now we trust Nuke to babysit.

1:05:52.774 --> 1:05:54.037
Kids, burgers!

1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:54.863
Shit.

1:06:00.391 --> 1:06:02.567
Daddy, was this on the ground?

1:06:02.610 --> 1:06:05.004
-No.
-You're lying. I saw it fall.

1:06:05.048 --> 1:06:07.267
Baby, I dropped it
into my hand, okay?

1:06:07.311 --> 1:06:09.182
-It's fine. You're fine.
-[grunts in frustration]

1:06:09.226 --> 1:06:10.531
[grunts]

1:06:10.575 --> 1:06:12.142
[music playing faintly]

1:06:12.185 --> 1:06:12.838
Saturdays.

1:06:15.623 --> 1:06:17.016
I can barely
take care of the dogs.

1:06:17.060 --> 1:06:18.278
I don't know
how you're doing all this.

1:06:18.322 --> 1:06:20.150
Yeah, I get it.

1:06:20.193 --> 1:06:21.629
Nuke was about
all I could handle,

1:06:21.673 --> 1:06:23.805
but when he stopped
struggling,

1:06:23.849 --> 1:06:25.155
that's when I realized
maybe I could

1:06:25.198 --> 1:06:26.591
stop struggling too, you know?

1:06:29.115 --> 1:06:31.596
[Briggs] Do you think Riley
could've fixed Lulu?

1:06:31.639 --> 1:06:34.425
[Noah] Not by keeping her
in the fight, no.

1:06:34.468 --> 1:06:37.167
You gotta know when to hang
'em up or check out, I guess.

1:06:39.082 --> 1:06:41.301
Well, sometimes Rangers
just find a way to die, man.

1:06:44.087 --> 1:06:46.089
Give Riley's mom a big hug.

1:06:46.132 --> 1:06:48.656
They didn't talk much, I know,
but she meant a lot to him.

1:06:48.700 --> 1:06:50.267
Yeah, I will, man.

1:06:52.573 --> 1:06:58.014
Oh, come on. No! Shit!
You gotta be kidding me.

1:06:59.102 --> 1:07:00.407
No, it's a real
nice neighborhood

1:07:00.451 --> 1:07:01.669
you got here, man.

1:07:03.236 --> 1:07:05.630
They got all my shit.
They got Riley's shit.

1:07:05.673 --> 1:07:07.284
They got my meds.

1:07:07.327 --> 1:07:08.937
Well, that's good.

1:07:08.981 --> 1:07:10.243
At least I can give
his parents his dog tags.

1:07:10.287 --> 1:07:11.679
-[Lulu whining]
-[Briggs] Oh, good.

1:07:11.723 --> 1:07:13.594
They left your unicorn.

1:07:13.638 --> 1:07:16.032
-[Lulu barking]
-Lulu, Lulu, here.

1:07:17.642 --> 1:07:19.078
Seek.

1:07:19.122 --> 1:07:20.166
[sniffing]

1:07:20.210 --> 1:07:21.559
[Briggs] Yeah, Lulu, go, seek.

1:07:25.693 --> 1:07:27.043
-[Noah] Good boy.
-[Briggs] Lulu, seek.

1:07:28.522 --> 1:07:29.915
[Noah] Seek, seek.

1:07:32.135 --> 1:07:34.006
What's in here?

1:07:34.050 --> 1:07:35.312
[Briggs] Oh, yeah. There we go.
There we go.

1:07:35.355 --> 1:07:37.488
Good boy, Nuke. Good boy.

1:07:37.531 --> 1:07:39.490
Okay, okay. Come on, Nuke.

1:07:39.533 --> 1:07:40.708
Come, Nuke. Nuke. Seek.

1:07:42.014 --> 1:07:43.711
I guess we're going
in the right direction.

1:07:43.755 --> 1:07:44.669
Seek, seek.

1:07:45.235 --> 1:07:46.410
Seek, seek.

1:07:46.453 --> 1:07:48.281
[Noah] Yes, baby, yes.

1:07:48.325 --> 1:07:50.327
Put the water on,
I'm sure it's boiling.

1:07:50.370 --> 1:07:52.242
Yes, pesto is fine.

1:07:52.285 --> 1:07:54.157
We're... I'm just showing
my buddy the Boardwalk.

1:07:54.200 --> 1:07:56.333
Sorry, Tiffany, I just
wanted to see the piers.

1:07:56.376 --> 1:07:58.291
[Noah] Yes, okay.
We'll be back soon, okay?

1:07:58.335 --> 1:07:59.336
[Briggs] Seek.

1:08:01.164 --> 1:08:02.774
-Nuke!
-[woman] Oh, hey!

1:08:02.817 --> 1:08:04.776
[panting]

1:08:04.819 --> 1:08:06.778
-[Lulu barking]
-Yeah, Lulu, go, go, seek.

1:08:09.433 --> 1:08:11.130
[Noah] Seek, seek.

1:08:11.174 --> 1:08:13.132
Just don't let her go.
Seek, Nuke.

1:08:14.786 --> 1:08:16.266
Seek.

1:08:16.309 --> 1:08:17.093
Seek, Nuke.

1:08:22.185 --> 1:08:25.362
Seek, seek, seek.

1:08:25.405 --> 1:08:28.495
Find it, Nuke. Find it.

1:08:28.539 --> 1:08:30.018
[indistinct chatter]

1:08:32.412 --> 1:08:34.110
-[man] Hey! Hey!
-[Briggs] Seek.

1:08:34.153 --> 1:08:35.502
[man] Joe! Shut the hell up.

1:08:35.546 --> 1:08:37.504
[sniffing]

1:08:37.548 --> 1:08:40.899
[Briggs] Seek, seek.

1:08:42.422 --> 1:08:43.728
Seek. Seek.

1:08:46.165 --> 1:08:47.427
Seek.

1:08:47.471 --> 1:08:49.908
[Lulu sniffing]

1:08:49.951 --> 1:08:51.823
-[Briggs] Seek.
-[Lulu whines]

1:08:51.866 --> 1:08:52.954
-[barking]
-[Briggs] Yeah, yeah,

1:08:52.998 --> 1:08:53.955
she found it, she found it.

1:08:55.653 --> 1:08:56.741
[Noah] Good boy, Nuke.

1:08:56.784 --> 1:08:58.395
[Briggs] Yeah, this is it.

1:08:58.438 --> 1:09:01.789
Yeah, yeah, it's my shit.
It's just everywhere.

1:09:01.833 --> 1:09:02.921
This crackhead's
probably snorting

1:09:02.964 --> 1:09:04.314
my migraine meds right now.

1:09:05.228 --> 1:09:07.317
[dogs barking]

1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:09.014
Yeah, most of
Riley's shit's here.

1:09:09.057 --> 1:09:10.189
Her book's here.

1:09:11.930 --> 1:09:14.715
Hey, what is this shit, man?
This is private property.

1:09:14.759 --> 1:09:16.413
-Oh, is it? That's yours?
-Yeah.

1:09:16.456 --> 1:09:18.328
-All right, Jackson, let's go.
-Your name's Rodriguez?

1:09:18.371 --> 1:09:20.417
Man, I'm a United States
army veteran, man.

1:09:20.460 --> 1:09:22.201
Yeah? Take it off right now.

1:09:22.245 --> 1:09:23.681
-I ain't taking off shit.
-What battalion were you in?

1:09:24.377 --> 1:09:25.726
That's classified.

1:09:25.770 --> 1:09:27.641
[groaning and screaming]

1:09:27.685 --> 1:09:30.601
[Briggs] Get it off!
Get it off!

1:09:30.644 --> 1:09:34.561
[thief continues screaming]
Oh, goddamn, man.

1:09:34.605 --> 1:09:36.955
Hey, I serve my country,

1:09:36.998 --> 1:09:38.565
and this is the thanks I get?

1:09:38.609 --> 1:09:39.871
I'm a war hero!

1:09:39.914 --> 1:09:41.655
[man] Get the fuck
outta here, man!

1:09:41.699 --> 1:09:43.266
[Noah] You're gonna be
all good without those meds?

1:09:43.309 --> 1:09:44.702
[Briggs] I should have
just let her eat

1:09:44.745 --> 1:09:46.573
that stolen valor
piece of shit.

1:09:46.617 --> 1:09:48.793
[Noah] You never know in places
like that who served.

1:09:49.924 --> 1:09:51.622
And if you were here
five years ago,

1:09:51.665 --> 1:09:53.493
you could have caught my ass
under that pier,

1:09:53.537 --> 1:09:55.887
and that would have been
the best-case scenario.

1:09:55.930 --> 1:09:57.802
[Briggs] Yeah, but I didn't.

1:09:57.845 --> 1:09:59.195
'Cause that bullshit ain't us.

1:09:59.238 --> 1:10:00.239
Yeah?

1:10:00.283 --> 1:10:01.240
What about Riley?

1:10:02.154 --> 1:10:03.938
What about Riley?

1:10:03.982 --> 1:10:06.071
I mean, the dude
couldn't get out of bed
without popping three percs.

1:10:07.333 --> 1:10:08.813
Well, that's just
the breakfast of champions,

1:10:08.856 --> 1:10:10.597
and he was a champion.

1:10:10.641 --> 1:10:13.078
I can't tell you how many
times he called me up,

1:10:13.121 --> 1:10:14.732
we'd get shitfaced
talking about

1:10:14.775 --> 1:10:16.429
how we were gonna check out.

1:10:16.473 --> 1:10:18.910
Look, man, we all
deal with shit

1:10:18.953 --> 1:10:20.738
to stay in the game, okay?

1:10:20.781 --> 1:10:22.130
So we're supposed
to stay in it forever?

1:10:23.393 --> 1:10:24.916
He used to talk
about driving off

1:10:24.959 --> 1:10:26.831
the Grand Canyon at top speed,

1:10:26.874 --> 1:10:29.312
but he drove himself
into a tree instead.

1:10:34.317 --> 1:10:35.753
I tried to get him to talk.

1:10:36.928 --> 1:10:38.625
Talk, like what,
to a therapist?

1:10:38.669 --> 1:10:40.236
That was a great idea.

1:10:40.279 --> 1:10:42.020
No, to other guys
who have gone through it,

1:10:42.063 --> 1:10:43.064
or even just to God.

1:10:43.891 --> 1:10:45.458
God?

1:10:45.502 --> 1:10:47.678
Okay, you didn't know shit
about Riley, all right?

1:10:47.721 --> 1:10:49.680
Look, by God, I mean anything.

1:10:49.723 --> 1:10:51.159
Could be a rock,
could be a shoe,

1:10:51.203 --> 1:10:53.118
could be his damn barber.

1:10:53.161 --> 1:10:55.903
But we all got to pick
something at some point.

1:10:56.556 --> 1:10:57.557
[Briggs] Well...

1:10:59.864 --> 1:11:03.781
he didn't, and he won't.

1:11:05.609 --> 1:11:07.741
So ain't no use
bitching about it.

1:11:07.785 --> 1:11:09.482
[Noah] You know, we trained
to put the whole world

1:11:09.526 --> 1:11:10.962
on our back.

1:11:11.005 --> 1:11:12.659
At the end of the day,

1:11:12.703 --> 1:11:14.139
the hardest thing was knocking
on a friend's door.

1:11:16.968 --> 1:11:18.056
Bye, Lulu.

1:11:18.099 --> 1:11:20.058
Say hi to your daddy for me.

1:11:20.101 --> 1:11:21.364
[panting and whining]

1:11:21.407 --> 1:11:23.366
I'll be praying for you guys.

1:11:23.409 --> 1:11:24.889
[Briggs] We're gonna
be just fine.

1:11:26.238 --> 1:11:27.718
Come here.

1:11:27.761 --> 1:11:28.893
-[Noah] Hello, guys.
-[indistinct chatter]

1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:42.167
[rainfall pattering]

1:12:08.672 --> 1:12:10.064
I hope you're ready
for this tomorrow,

1:12:10.108 --> 1:12:12.153
because you know
what they want, right?

1:12:13.807 --> 1:12:18.638
They want the hero war dog
all sad and stoic,

1:12:18.682 --> 1:12:21.206
just missing her
hero war daddy.

1:12:23.774 --> 1:12:25.428
What they definitely
don't want...

1:12:25.471 --> 1:12:27.560
They definitely don't want you
trying to eat everybody

1:12:27.604 --> 1:12:29.954
as soon as the color guard
starts firing their salute.

1:12:32.652 --> 1:12:33.958
Now, they...
They don't know you.

1:12:34.828 --> 1:12:36.395
That's for damn sure.

1:12:38.223 --> 1:12:39.964
They don't know
what it takes to be a hero.

1:12:41.661 --> 1:12:43.968
The things you've done
to be a hero dog.

1:12:45.448 --> 1:12:46.449
If they knew the truth,

1:12:47.841 --> 1:12:51.541
it would scare the living shit
out of them.

1:12:55.980 --> 1:12:58.069
You know, when I got out,

1:12:58.112 --> 1:13:00.201
your daddy gave me
this shitty piece of plywood

1:13:00.245 --> 1:13:02.378
with the word "Thanks"
carved in it. [chuckles]

1:13:05.250 --> 1:13:07.034
It's like, what else
do you say to somebody

1:13:07.078 --> 1:13:09.776
that you experience
what we experienced together?

1:13:12.649 --> 1:13:13.650
You even listening to me?

1:13:15.652 --> 1:13:17.567
Just talking to a dog.

1:13:17.610 --> 1:13:20.004
-[screeching]
-[Lulu whining]

1:13:21.832 --> 1:13:23.094
What is that?

1:13:23.137 --> 1:13:24.269
No. No, no.

1:13:26.227 --> 1:13:27.011
No, no. Come on.

1:13:28.229 --> 1:13:29.405
Don't you do this to me now.

1:13:36.499 --> 1:13:37.456
No.

1:13:39.676 --> 1:13:41.242
Ow. [grunts]

1:13:44.332 --> 1:13:45.116
[groans]

1:13:46.944 --> 1:13:48.598
-Okay...
-[whines]

1:13:48.641 --> 1:13:50.208
Of course, there's no service.

1:13:50.251 --> 1:13:51.339
Why would we have service?

1:13:53.516 --> 1:13:54.299
[growls softly]

1:14:22.501 --> 1:14:23.241
Hey, hey, hey.

1:14:26.766 --> 1:14:27.767
Hello?

1:14:31.467 --> 1:14:32.468
Hey.

1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:48.005
Come on.

1:14:51.356 --> 1:14:53.489
All right, we got to go.

1:14:53.532 --> 1:14:55.403
-Come on. We're moving on.
-[thunder rumbling]

1:14:55.447 --> 1:14:56.753
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-[Lulu barking]

1:14:56.796 --> 1:14:58.842
Hey, hey, no.

1:14:58.885 --> 1:15:00.757
No. Chill out.

1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:04.195
-[barking continues]
-Hey. Hey, hey!

1:15:04.238 --> 1:15:06.110
No! Stop! Relax!

1:15:06.153 --> 1:15:08.547
Look, stop. It's just thunder.

1:15:08.591 --> 1:15:10.897
It's just a thunderstorm.
We gotta... Stop.

1:15:11.768 --> 1:15:13.334
-Calm down. Stop!
-[growls]

1:15:13.378 --> 1:15:14.945
Hey!

1:15:14.988 --> 1:15:16.990
All right, you want to go?
Come on. Come on, then.

1:15:17.034 --> 1:15:18.949
Come on,
you're not gonna do shit.

1:15:20.211 --> 1:15:21.429
Come on, then, let's go!

1:15:22.605 --> 1:15:25.564
[barks, growling]

1:15:25.608 --> 1:15:27.305
[panting]

1:15:31.657 --> 1:15:32.440
Such a coward.

1:15:37.620 --> 1:15:40.448
[barking]

1:15:52.635 --> 1:15:54.941
[thunder rumbling]

1:16:02.383 --> 1:16:04.864
[soft music playing]

1:16:34.677 --> 1:16:37.244
Easy. I'm not gonna make you
go out there, okay?

1:16:37.288 --> 1:16:39.246
How about we just chill out
for a little while?

1:16:39.290 --> 1:16:40.508
Relax.

1:16:40.552 --> 1:16:41.771
-[thunder rumbles]
-[whines]

1:16:41.814 --> 1:16:43.424
Hey, it's okay.

1:16:43.468 --> 1:16:44.991
It's just thunder
and a little lightning.

1:16:46.689 --> 1:16:49.474
You know what? How about this?
Let me see if I can

1:16:49.517 --> 1:16:52.129
give us a little something
to take our mind off.

1:16:52.172 --> 1:16:54.479
Cross your paws.
Let's see if this thing works.

1:16:54.522 --> 1:16:55.393
What do you feel like?

1:16:57.047 --> 1:16:58.483
Who doesn't like
San Francisco?

1:16:58.526 --> 1:17:00.050
You want to watch
your greatest hits,

1:17:00.093 --> 1:17:01.486
or do you wanna watch...
Wanna watch Grey's?

1:17:01.529 --> 1:17:02.705
I'm gonna go with Grey's.

1:17:05.925 --> 1:17:07.535
[laughs] It works.

1:17:11.539 --> 1:17:12.845
We're just gonna rest,

1:17:12.889 --> 1:17:15.108
we're gonna get
a little cozy, relax.

1:17:16.675 --> 1:17:17.720
[TV playing indistinctly]

1:17:19.460 --> 1:17:21.245
Watch a little trash TV.

1:17:23.203 --> 1:17:25.684
A little snack 'cause
you can't watch trash TV

1:17:25.728 --> 1:17:26.511
without a snack.

1:17:29.122 --> 1:17:30.123
[thunder rumbling]

1:17:31.647 --> 1:17:32.430
What?

1:17:33.910 --> 1:17:34.650
Oh, you want some?

1:17:42.135 --> 1:17:43.920
[laughs] Look at that.

1:17:45.835 --> 1:17:48.359
Who knew you just needed
to have a fight to get along?

1:17:53.277 --> 1:17:54.495
Did Latin Shakespeare ever,

1:17:54.539 --> 1:17:56.280
like, read you
his love letters?

1:17:58.978 --> 1:18:00.153
Some pretty good ones
in there.

1:18:03.417 --> 1:18:04.288
Let's see.

1:18:08.118 --> 1:18:09.206
What about...

1:18:10.816 --> 1:18:12.688
Okay. [chuckles]

1:18:15.429 --> 1:18:20.696
"I woke for an instant when
I saw you covered in dirt.

1:18:23.524 --> 1:18:24.874
You've taken bullets before.

1:18:26.223 --> 1:18:27.485
This was the worst.

1:18:30.009 --> 1:18:31.315
The guilt still haunts me.

1:18:32.969 --> 1:18:34.971
I'm not going to lie,

1:18:35.014 --> 1:18:37.451
but I know you did
what you did that night,

1:18:37.495 --> 1:18:39.540
so none of your brothers
had to die."

1:18:40.324 --> 1:18:41.499
It's pretty good.

1:18:44.589 --> 1:18:46.025
"When they took you away,

1:18:46.069 --> 1:18:48.767
I was sure
we'd run out of time

1:18:50.813 --> 1:18:52.249
and that's when
it hit me, girl,

1:18:54.860 --> 1:18:56.514
I was never your handler.

1:18:59.212 --> 1:19:01.214
That you were actually mine.

1:19:04.130 --> 1:19:06.437
Your brother, Riley."

1:19:09.048 --> 1:19:10.180
You slept with Corrine?

1:19:11.268 --> 1:19:12.922
Yeah.

1:19:12.965 --> 1:19:14.750
[Briggs] What? Okay.

1:19:14.793 --> 1:19:16.360
[Sloan] While I was dealing
with my sick daughter?

1:19:16.403 --> 1:19:18.362
I cannot believe
you actually like this trash.

1:19:19.058 --> 1:19:20.625
Unreal.

1:19:20.668 --> 1:19:22.018
All right, the sun's up.

1:19:22.061 --> 1:19:23.062
It's time.

1:19:25.282 --> 1:19:28.764
There is about zero chance
of us making it

1:19:28.807 --> 1:19:30.504
a hundred clicks in six hours

1:19:30.548 --> 1:19:32.202
with no cell phone service
or ride.

1:19:32.245 --> 1:19:35.466
But, hey, last time I checked,

1:19:35.509 --> 1:19:37.468
"surrender"
is not a Ranger word.

1:19:37.511 --> 1:19:40.166
["Hold On" playing]

1:19:40.210 --> 1:19:42.865
I don't know about you,
but I got a funeral to go to.

1:19:45.258 --> 1:19:46.259
Come on.

1:19:50.916 --> 1:19:51.699
Come on.

1:20:11.110 --> 1:20:14.766
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Hey.

Hey, hey, hey, please, please.
Come on.

Come on! Man.

[conversing in Spanish]

1:21:50.949 --> 1:21:52.342
We're gonna make it.

1:21:52.385 --> 1:21:53.386
Come on.

1:21:54.170 --> 1:21:56.172
[grunts] Come on.

1:22:00.002 --> 1:22:01.003
Come on.

1:22:04.441 --> 1:22:05.442
Almost there.

1:22:08.706 --> 1:22:10.447
[priest] May you know
the Lord's love and peace.

1:22:10.490 --> 1:22:11.796
[Briggs]
You're gonna look great.

1:22:11.839 --> 1:22:13.102
You're gonna look like a hero,

1:22:13.145 --> 1:22:14.581
just like
Riley would've wanted.

1:22:14.625 --> 1:22:16.366
-[panting]
-Okay.

1:22:16.409 --> 1:22:18.324
You know what else
Riley would've liked?

1:22:18.368 --> 1:22:21.414
You not to bite anybody,
so maybe just don't do that.

1:22:22.111 --> 1:22:23.721
Come on.

1:22:23.764 --> 1:22:25.201
[priest]
Receive the Lord's blessings.

1:22:26.419 --> 1:22:28.726
May the Lord bless you
and watch over you.

1:22:30.293 --> 1:22:31.598
May He make His face
to shine upon

1:22:31.642 --> 1:22:32.643
each and every one of you

1:22:33.774 --> 1:22:35.167
and be gracious to you.

May He look lovingly on you

know love and happiness.

[softly]
No, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.

1:22:49.094 --> 1:22:50.400
[priest] May you know
that love deeply.

[Briggs whispering
indistinctly]

1:22:51.923 --> 1:22:53.490

be with you.

[crowd softly] Aw.

1:23:31.180 --> 1:23:33.617
[priest] So let us rejoice for
our dearly departed brother.

1:23:35.749 --> 1:23:37.664
For he has stood
his last watch,

1:23:37.708 --> 1:23:40.058
and he's now
on his final deployment.

1:23:40.102 --> 1:23:42.800
In the name of the Father
and the Son

1:23:42.843 --> 1:23:45.629

On behalf of the President
of the United States,

and a grateful nation.

All right, I'll tell him
to expect your call.

Hey, and, Captain, thank you
for making this call.

1:25:41.179 --> 1:25:42.180
-I really appreciate it.
-You got it, brother.

1:25:42.224 --> 1:25:43.616
Oh, uh, one more thing.

1:25:43.660 --> 1:25:46.837
Look, she's...
She's doing a lot better.

1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:49.056
I mean, she's a completely
different dog now.

1:25:49.100 --> 1:25:50.449
I don't know, maybe there's
someone on base

1:25:50.493 --> 1:25:52.190
that one of us could talk to.

1:25:52.234 --> 1:25:54.366
[Jones] Briggs, you know
that's not up to us.

1:25:56.063 --> 1:25:58.065
-Just get it done.
-[Briggs] Yeah.

1:25:58.109 --> 1:25:59.154
[Jones] Good luck over there,
Briggs.

1:25:59.676 --> 1:26:00.677
Yes, sir.

All right.

Hmm?

to do tricks, kid. No.

1:31:28.134 --> 1:31:29.527
[door opens]

1:31:29.571 --> 1:31:31.529
[Briggs] All right, Lulu,
come on.

1:31:34.793 --> 1:31:35.707
[door closes]

1:31:46.588 --> 1:31:48.024
-ID, sir?
-Yeah.

1:31:49.765 --> 1:31:51.201
-Your army ID has expired.
-[sighs]

1:31:51.244 --> 1:31:52.376
You're required by law
to dispose...

1:31:52.419 --> 1:31:53.856
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got you.

1:31:53.899 --> 1:31:54.987
Uh, I'm just dropping off
the dog, man,

1:31:55.031 --> 1:31:56.511
uh, to a Corporal Levitz.

1:31:57.337 --> 1:31:58.338
Hey, Levitz!

1:31:59.557 --> 1:32:00.602
Do me a favor,
park right here.

1:32:00.645 --> 1:32:01.428
[Briggs] Yeah.

1:32:13.876 --> 1:32:16.008
Shit, man. You Rangers
ever hear of callin'?

1:32:16.052 --> 1:32:18.315
I've been out here cooking
my ass off for an hour.

1:32:19.359 --> 1:32:20.186
It could be worse.

1:32:21.274 --> 1:32:22.972
You could be actually working.

1:32:23.015 --> 1:32:24.626
[Levitz] All right, man.
I hear she's a real killer,

1:32:24.669 --> 1:32:25.975
so just make sure
you muzzle her up good, okay?

1:32:26.018 --> 1:32:27.019
[Briggs] Yeah.

1:32:28.804 --> 1:32:30.196
Don't worry.

1:32:30.240 --> 1:32:31.807
She ain't gonna be a problem.

1:32:32.459 --> 1:32:33.330
Are you, girl?

1:32:34.636 --> 1:32:37.813
Last time, okay? Last time.

1:32:37.856 --> 1:32:39.597
Just gonna put it on
one more time.

1:32:39.641 --> 1:32:41.860
[Lulu whining]

1:32:41.904 --> 1:32:43.993
Hey, man,
she's been doing a lot better.

1:32:44.036 --> 1:32:48.301
So just make sure the vet techs,
you know, reevaluate her, give
her a chance.

1:32:48.345 --> 1:32:49.564
[Levitz] Yeah, yeah,
they got their protocol.

1:32:51.391 --> 1:32:52.567
You heard me. Make sure.

1:32:54.481 --> 1:32:56.962
So as soon as we're done here,
you're gonna call
Captain Jones, yeah?

1:32:57.006 --> 1:32:59.791
- That's what
they're telling me.
- What are you... Look, man, are
you trying to piss her off?

1:32:59.835 --> 1:33:00.792
[Lulu whining]

1:33:02.185 --> 1:33:03.186
[sighs deeply]

1:33:05.884 --> 1:33:09.322
All right. You're gonna
be okay, all right?

1:33:09.366 --> 1:33:10.933
[Levitz] Come on, man,
I ain't got all day, let's go.

1:33:10.976 --> 1:33:12.282
[Briggs] I'm just gonna
put this on you.

1:33:14.893 --> 1:33:15.894
[Lulu whining softly]

1:33:19.115 --> 1:33:20.856
[whispers] Give 'em hell.

1:33:20.899 --> 1:33:21.900
All right, let's go.

1:33:24.686 --> 1:33:26.209

1:33:31.693 --> 1:33:32.694

1:33:46.533 --> 1:33:49.232
[Lulu barking in distance]

1:33:51.103 --> 1:33:52.539
Oh. No, no, no, no, no.

1:33:53.845 --> 1:33:55.238

-[Briggs] Come on.

1:33:58.589 --> 1:33:59.808

1:33:59.851 --> 1:34:01.636
[Lulu barking and whining]

1:34:10.514 --> 1:34:12.647
God. Easy, easy, easy, easy.

[tires screech]

1:34:24.006 --> 1:34:25.529
[Briggs] Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1:34:25.572 --> 1:34:27.270
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:34:27.313 --> 1:34:29.185
Hi, hi, hi.
No. It's fine. It's fine.

1:34:29.228 --> 1:34:32.188
My bad. I should have...
You know what, I should have
put a vest on her.

1:34:32.231 --> 1:34:34.103
She listens more
when the vest is on.

1:34:34.146 --> 1:34:35.931
You know girls
and their fashion. [chuckles]

1:34:35.974 --> 1:34:37.280
I'll be right back. Up!

1:34:38.716 --> 1:34:39.674
Get there.

1:34:41.414 --> 1:34:43.590
Sir, you forgot your ID.

1:34:43.634 --> 1:34:46.942
Uh, you know what, man,
why don't you keep it?

1:34:46.985 --> 1:34:47.986
Thank you for your service.

1:34:50.772 --> 1:34:52.512
Hey, man, what about the dog?

1:34:52.556 --> 1:34:55.428
What are you...
What are you looking at?

1:34:55.472 --> 1:34:58.605
Let's not make this
all emotional, okay?

1:35:02.958 --> 1:35:05.351
[Lulu whining]

1:35:19.061 --> 1:35:20.018
[Briggs] Dear Lulu,

1:35:23.805 --> 1:35:25.545
I got the adoption papers
from the army today.

1:35:33.162 --> 1:35:35.338
Riley would be so proud.

1:35:35.381 --> 1:35:37.035
[inaudible]

1:35:38.254 --> 1:35:40.343
Maybe even of both of us.

1:35:49.700 --> 1:35:52.224
Look, I'm no good
at this poem stuff,

1:35:52.268 --> 1:35:56.228
so I'll just
get to the damn point.

1:35:59.275 --> 1:36:00.276
Thanks.

1:36:02.321 --> 1:36:03.453
Thanks for saving my life.
