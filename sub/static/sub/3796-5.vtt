WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:03.357
I'm gonna need you and your buddy
to come down to the station,

00:03.391 --> 00:05.836
- give an official statement.
- Come on, come on, let him through.

00:05.870 --> 00:08.080
He's not answering anything.
Your lawyer's inside, Vince. Come on, let's go.

00:08.114 --> 00:11.018
The news says that Vince is
gonna have to take a drug test.

00:11.053 --> 00:14.096
- Don't worry about that.
- If he fails, we have a big problem.

00:14.131 --> 00:16.184
I smoked a joint last week.

00:16.219 --> 00:18.252
You think your guy's
thing can fool 'em?

00:18.287 --> 00:19.529
I know it can.
I've done it.

00:19.564 --> 00:20.968
I don't feel right
about this though, Vince.

00:21.002 --> 00:22.773
As long as it works.

00:22.808 --> 00:24.241
Ari, what are you doing here?

00:24.275 --> 00:26.243
I'm on a date.
I'm at my favorite restaurant.

00:26.277 --> 00:28.980
- What's the problem?
- He'll have to explain that to you.

00:29.015 --> 00:32.020
- How could you fucking use me like that?
- Dana, I was not using you.

00:32.054 --> 00:34.223
- I'm wearing a fake cock.
- What?

00:34.257 --> 00:37.160
I will fail this test and I don't
know what they're gonna do to me.

00:37.194 --> 00:38.897
It's weed!
The judge is cool

00:38.932 --> 00:40.833
but no judge is gonna
be cool with that.

00:40.868 --> 00:43.004
Things always work out
for us, Vince.

00:43.038 --> 00:45.140
I'm all good.

I don't mean to put any unnecessary
pressure on you, Vince,

02:02.444 --> 02:04.311
but it's <i>very</i> important
that this goes well.

02:04.346 --> 02:06.313
When have I ever not
aced an interview?

02:06.347 --> 02:08.549
There was that little
incident with Maria Menounos,

02:08.584 --> 02:10.651
but you were on downers.
Or was it uppers?

02:10.686 --> 02:12.954
My head and my body
are completely clear today.

02:12.989 --> 02:15.457
We're not talking "Access Hollywood"
here, Vince.

02:15.492 --> 02:18.761
- This is "Vanity Fair," possibly the cover.
- Don't worry. I got it.

02:18.796 --> 02:20.630
This is just print.
No getting out of bad remarks

02:20.664 --> 02:22.732
- with your pretty eyes.
- They're not doing the photo shoot?

02:22.767 --> 02:24.968
- Please try and take this seriously.
- Yeah, seriously, Vin.

02:25.002 --> 02:27.371
- Please don't forget to mention Don Peppe's.
- Of course not.

02:27.405 --> 02:28.805
This is about rehabbing
Vince's image, Turtle,

02:28.840 --> 02:30.573
not marketing your
fucking greasy spoon.

02:30.608 --> 02:33.410
- Hey, Don Peppe's is no greasy spoon, Shauna.
- No, it's not.

02:33.444 --> 02:35.812
- Best Italian East of the Miss.
- Soon to be the west too.

02:35.847 --> 02:38.248
This is about you, Vince,
not Italian food.

02:38.282 --> 02:40.684
Vince <i>loves</i> Italian food.
So maybe he can just mention it.

02:40.718 --> 02:42.786
Anything to bring those
baked clams to Beverly hills.

02:42.820 --> 02:45.088
Plus, I wore the shirt.
Maybe she'll ask me about it.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.023
- Oh Jesus.
- It's a good shirt.

02:47.058 --> 02:50.093
- Hi. We're here to meet Sophia Lear.
- Oh, just one second.

02:50.127 --> 02:51.995
So what's this Sophia like?
Tough?

02:52.029 --> 02:53.696
Well, she can be.
Depends on if she likes you.

02:53.731 --> 02:56.432
- What's not to like about Vince? Look at him.
- Look at you.

02:56.466 --> 02:59.201
She's right this way.
Follow me.

03:02.071 --> 03:04.539
- Is that her?
- Yep.

03:04.574 --> 03:06.575
- You're kidding.
- Take it easy.

03:06.610 --> 03:09.111
Vincent Chase is here.

03:09.146 --> 03:11.981
- Hi, Sophia.
- Shauna, so nice to see you again.

03:12.015 --> 03:14.283
- And you.
- Vince, Sophia Lear.

03:14.318 --> 03:17.520
- Such a pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah, thanks. You too.

03:17.554 --> 03:19.288
I'm Turtle, friend of Vince's,

03:19.322 --> 03:21.390
and future owner of the best
Italian restaurant in Los Angeles.

03:21.424 --> 03:24.293
And future occupier of the bar stool
back there.

03:24.327 --> 03:27.263
- Nobody puts Baby in the corner.
- Ah, "Dirty Dancing."

03:27.297 --> 03:30.300
Yeah, it was on last night.
I was flippin' by.

03:30.334 --> 03:32.701
No one cares.
Baby to the corner.

03:32.736 --> 03:35.137
- Nice to meet you, Turtle.
- You too.

03:35.172 --> 03:37.974
- You can't stay either, I'm afraid, Shauna.
- Oh sure sure,

03:38.008 --> 03:40.543
- I'll just eavesdrop from a distance.
- Great.

03:40.577 --> 03:42.545
You're ready to start?
We can sit right over here.

03:42.579 --> 03:44.447
Yeah. You're gonna go
easy on me though, right?

03:44.481 --> 03:47.083
Yes. I hope you studied
up on Foreign Affairs.

03:47.117 --> 03:50.152
The world is dying to know
what Vincent Chase thinks

03:50.187 --> 03:52.953
- of the nuclear arms bills being debated.
- I would love to talk

03:52.987 --> 03:56.188
- about the transition of power in North Korea.
- Really?

03:56.222 --> 03:58.123
- I'm kidding.
- Oh, good.

03:58.157 --> 04:01.792
So was I. No, I really just want to talk
about you and where you're from et cetera.

04:01.826 --> 04:03.627
Whatever you want.
I'm entirely yours.

04:03.661 --> 04:05.394
<i>You need</i>
<i>to calm down, Drama.</i>

04:05.429 --> 04:07.196
How can I when my life
is falling apart

04:07.230 --> 04:09.532
- and my representatives don't seem to care?
- We care.

04:09.566 --> 04:12.400
There's just nothing we can do.
Dice's brain has left the building.

04:12.434 --> 04:14.603
Yeah, his hack replacement
is killing my show.

04:14.638 --> 04:16.305
Yeah, but it's your
job to unkill it.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.040
Well, maybe you can
talk some sense into him

04:18.074 --> 04:20.041
- 'cause he won't talk to me.
- He fired us.

04:20.075 --> 04:22.309
Well, call him up
and try and smooth it over.

04:22.344 --> 04:23.744
- I did call him.
- What did he say?

04:23.779 --> 04:26.012
He said his foreskin was
more supportive than we are.

04:26.046 --> 04:28.681
- I thought Dice was a Jew.
- He's reformed.

04:28.715 --> 04:30.882
- So what am I supposed to do?
- Your job, Drama.

04:30.917 --> 04:33.051
- And do it well.
- I used to do my job well, E,

04:33.085 --> 04:35.019
but this new guy
just really sucks.

04:35.054 --> 04:37.721
Would you guys at least
come down to the studio

04:37.756 --> 04:40.124
- and tell me I'm not crazy?
- No.

04:40.158 --> 04:41.491
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't want to.

04:41.526 --> 04:43.126
And I can't.
I have a meeting with Melinda Clark.

04:43.161 --> 04:44.928
Sloan's mother?!

04:44.962 --> 04:47.097
- It's her ex-stepmother.
- I said the exact same thing.

04:47.131 --> 04:50.299
Why would you have a meeting
with your ex's ex-stepmother?

04:50.334 --> 04:52.735
- I said that too. I said that too.
- She needs advice.

04:52.769 --> 04:55.470
Advice on what?
She already has a manager.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.272
I don't know.
Maybe she needs another opinion.

04:57.306 --> 04:59.006
<i>I don't know. I do think
she's talented though.</i>

04:59.040 --> 05:01.473
- <i>We think that you are emotional.</i>
- Extremely.

05:01.507 --> 05:05.609
Okay? And you are going to be tempted
to use this as a way to get Sloan back.

05:05.643 --> 05:07.644
It's her ex-stepmother.
How's that gonna work?

05:07.679 --> 05:09.879
- I don't know. I'm not an emotional person.
- Me neither.

05:09.914 --> 05:11.547
I have never had to win a
woman back, all right?

05:11.581 --> 05:13.582
I just figured it was kind of a
mopey-guy kind of the thing to do.

05:13.616 --> 05:15.517
- Don't be a mope, e!
- You're a mope, Drama!

05:15.551 --> 05:17.418
- You're a mope! - You're a mope. 
I'm not trying to get Sloan back.

05:17.453 --> 05:19.253
Get out of my office.
Go to work!

05:19.287 --> 05:21.421
All right, if you
can call it work.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.291
- Hello, Eric.
- Hello, Melinda. How are you?

05:25.326 --> 05:27.292
Oh, great.
Well, good.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.327
Um, I heard you and Sloan
broke up.

05:29.361 --> 05:31.662
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, that's okay.

05:31.697 --> 05:34.699
I can't stay.
Um, I just wanted to introduce myself.

05:34.733 --> 05:36.634
- I'm Scott Lavin.
- Nice to meet you.

05:36.668 --> 05:39.670
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

05:42.073 --> 05:44.808
Okay. All right.

05:44.843 --> 05:46.476
That's my partner.

05:46.510 --> 05:48.845
- He's odd.
- Yeah.

05:48.879 --> 05:50.412
Anyway, please sit down.

05:50.447 --> 05:53.114
So tell me uh, what
happening with you?

05:53.149 --> 05:55.283
- I wanna work.
- Oh, that's great.

05:55.317 --> 05:57.985
I need to work.
Since Terrance and I got divorced,

05:58.020 --> 06:01.689
- I just can't sit still. That's not pathetic,
right? - No, of course not.

06:01.723 --> 06:04.992
I always thought you taking three years
off was a complete waste of your talent.

06:05.026 --> 06:06.760
Well, that's sweet
of you to say.

06:06.794 --> 06:10.629
But unfortunately my manager didn't take
too kindly to my hiatus and dropped me.

06:10.664 --> 06:12.297
Really?
I didn't know that.

06:12.332 --> 06:15.500
Well, why do you think I'm here?
I want you to manage me.

06:15.534 --> 06:17.101
Why me?

06:17.136 --> 06:19.270
Sloan always spoke
so highly of you.

06:19.304 --> 06:22.139
I may hate her father, but I
always loved and respected her.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.240
- Yeah.
- Eric, I'm so sorry.

06:24.275 --> 06:27.243
I don't--
I don't mean to put you on the spot,

06:27.277 --> 06:30.279
but I'm focused and committed
to getting my career back,

06:30.313 --> 06:34.182
so think about it.
It would <i>really</i> mean a lot to me.

06:35.284 --> 06:37.018
Why do we have
to go to Disneyland?

06:37.053 --> 06:39.988
Because it's your father's day and
that's where he wants to take you.

06:40.022 --> 06:41.990
Well, let him take Jonah.
I'll just hang.

06:42.024 --> 06:44.892
I may not want you there,
but daddy does, so be nice.

06:44.926 --> 06:47.695
- Well put, honey.
- 18-year-olds don't go to Disneyland

06:47.729 --> 06:49.396
- unless they're stoned.
- You're awful.

06:49.431 --> 06:53.066
There they are. Who's ready for "Tea
Cups" and "It's A Small World"?

06:53.100 --> 06:54.434
Was thinking
"Space Mountain."

06:54.469 --> 06:56.836
- I was thinking about staying home.
- Oh, come on,

06:56.904 --> 06:59.071
- we're gonna have fun.
- Okay, guys, enjoy.

06:59.106 --> 07:01.807
- Wait, hold on. Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

07:01.841 --> 07:03.675
Well, you came up.
There must've been a reason.

07:03.709 --> 07:06.143
Jonah begged me to.
And you know when his beg turns into a cry.

07:06.178 --> 07:09.579
- No, okay, yeah, I know.
- Ari. Ari, are you going somewhere?

07:09.613 --> 07:12.982
Yes, I am, Babs.
I'm going to the happiest place on earth--

07:13.017 --> 07:15.151
- Disneyland. What's the problem?
- Hello, dear.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.587
- Hello. - The problem is, 
Taylor Lautner's buddy just finished

07:17.621 --> 07:20.355
writing a script and he loves
it and he wants to star in it,

07:20.390 --> 07:22.557
- and he wants Dana to have the first shot
at it. - Dana Gordon?

07:22.592 --> 07:25.092
You can handle it.
I'm going to Disneyland.

07:25.127 --> 07:27.761
And <i>I</i> am going home.

07:27.796 --> 07:29.562
- Bye-bye.
- Jake,

07:29.597 --> 07:32.832
take Jonah and Sarah to the freebie
closet and have them pick something out.

07:32.867 --> 07:34.234
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

07:34.268 --> 07:36.168
- You spoke to Dana about this?
- Yes.

07:36.203 --> 07:37.970
- And she's coming here?
- Yes.

07:38.004 --> 07:40.972
- But why don't we just send it to her?
- It can't leave the office.

07:41.007 --> 07:42.540
Taylor's gonna come here
and watch her read it.

07:42.574 --> 07:44.675
Then she has 12 hours to
decide if she's gonna buy it

07:44.709 --> 07:47.444
- or he moves on to the next studio.
- I can't be here.

07:47.478 --> 07:49.479
I'll let Taylor know.
I'll tell him you're too busy

07:49.513 --> 07:50.881
on the "Pirates of the Caribbean" ride.

07:50.915 --> 07:54.251
You know
how understanding he is.

07:56.554 --> 07:58.222
Jake,

07:58.256 --> 08:01.224
get Dana Gordon on the phone.

08:01.258 --> 08:03.993
- What do you want, Ari?
- <i>I don't want this meeting to be weird.</i>

08:04.027 --> 08:05.761
- Then don't act weird.
- You don't act weird.

08:05.796 --> 08:08.630
- You're already acting weird.
- If you're using business to see me,

08:08.665 --> 08:10.966
- that's ridiculous.
- I'm coming to your office

08:11.001 --> 08:12.634
for Taylor Lautner,
not for you.

08:12.668 --> 08:14.869
- Are you sure?
- <i>Ari, I don't have time for games.</i>

08:14.903 --> 08:17.371
- There's nothing to worry about on my end.
- Mine either.

08:17.405 --> 08:21.274
Well, then let's get this done and move
on with the day as fast as possible.

08:22.776 --> 08:26.046
- Dad, when are we going?
- Change of plans, buddy.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.715
We are going to the L.A. Zoo
because it's closer.

08:28.749 --> 08:32.318
- That sucks.
- But guess who's coming to the office?

08:32.352 --> 08:34.553
- Taylor Lautner.
- Ew.

08:34.587 --> 08:36.388
- Really?! I love you, daddy.
- Mm-hmm.

08:36.422 --> 08:38.957
She gets to hang with the wolfman

08:38.991 --> 08:41.392
provided he keeps his shirt on.
He has 4% body fat.

08:41.426 --> 08:44.761
Daddy has 5%. Tell mommy.
Daddy's been working out.

08:44.795 --> 08:48.130
Apart from the drugs, would you say
that you had any other addictions?

08:48.165 --> 08:50.265
- Any other...?
- Gambling, food.

08:50.300 --> 08:52.200
Well, I'm Italian.
I love food.

08:52.235 --> 08:53.869
Have you ever been
to Don Peppe's in Queens?

08:53.903 --> 08:56.738
- No. I can't say that I have.
- I'd love to take you there sometime.

08:56.772 --> 08:58.341
Okay, one step at a time.
Addictions?

08:58.375 --> 09:00.810
- Maybe women.
- Really?

09:00.844 --> 09:04.013
No, not really, but I have a
big heart, so I fall easily.

09:04.047 --> 09:06.948
- And often?
- Well, if I feel the chemistry

09:06.983 --> 09:09.016
it's kind of hard
for me to ignore it.

09:09.051 --> 09:11.785
- Don't you agree?
- Do you ever feel guilty

09:11.820 --> 09:14.954
- for everything that you have?
- I think to be guilty would be arrogant.

09:14.989 --> 09:17.723
I appreciate it all and I'm lucky
to share it with my friends.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.993
- And your family?
- Well, my mother is happy with bragging rights,

09:21.027 --> 09:22.661
but I do for her
what she'll let me.

09:22.695 --> 09:25.897
- And your father?
- If he were around,

09:25.931 --> 09:27.332
I'm sure I'd do for him
what I could too.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.066
And when was the last
time you saw him?

09:29.101 --> 09:31.035
- When I was eight.
- Let's talk about that.

09:31.069 --> 09:35.605
- I'd rather talk about how beautiful
your eyes are. - Oh, Vince, always a charmer.

09:35.639 --> 09:37.439
- Shauna.
- I'm sorry.

09:37.474 --> 09:38.874
- That's okay.
- I think I have enough.

09:38.908 --> 09:40.408
- Really?
- You know, it was great.

09:40.443 --> 09:42.677
- All right.
- We appreciate this, Sophia.

09:42.711 --> 09:44.745
If you have any further questions,
please don't hesitate to call.

09:44.780 --> 09:47.514
- Yeah, I'd love to talk some more.
- Okay. Thanks.

09:47.549 --> 09:50.117
<i>Come on, Vince.</i>

09:50.151 --> 09:53.853
- That was a disaster! - Well, you obviously
couldn't hear the whole thing, Shauna.

09:53.887 --> 09:55.888
No one has ever asked me
such poignant questions.

09:55.923 --> 09:58.390
And you didn't answer <i>any</i> of them.
You flirted with her

09:58.425 --> 10:01.159
- like a 14-year-old.
- Sophia said she liked it.

10:01.194 --> 10:03.428
And she ended the interview
basically in the middle.

10:03.462 --> 10:05.463
- Really?
- Really.

10:05.497 --> 10:07.798
- Then I should call her and apologize.
- No, Vincent, you shouldn't.

10:07.833 --> 10:09.767
- <i>I</i> will call her.
- Shauna, let me handle this.

10:09.801 --> 10:12.702
- What, you're gonna ask her out again?
- You asked her out?

10:12.737 --> 10:16.138
- I asked her if she wanted to go
to Don Peppe's. - That's business.

10:16.173 --> 10:17.773
- Thank you, Vin.
- Vince, Sophia is very very smart

10:17.807 --> 10:19.975
and very very good at what she does.
Now I don't think

10:20.009 --> 10:22.443
that you said anything that'll
really hurt you, but you could.

10:22.478 --> 10:26.480
Shauna, please
let me handle it.

10:26.514 --> 10:30.117
Sorry, Johnny.
Turns out your precious banana tree

10:30.151 --> 10:32.552
is on 51% of my property.

10:32.586 --> 10:34.920
- Oh.
- That can't be!

10:34.955 --> 10:37.756
Call your lawyer.
I already called mine.

10:37.790 --> 10:40.625
- Stop sawing!
- Timber!

10:40.659 --> 10:42.893
- My car!
- Whoops.

10:42.928 --> 10:44.695
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh...

10:44.729 --> 10:47.564
See? There it is.
I fucking love that.

10:47.598 --> 10:50.500
I'm gonna kill you, Ronald!

10:56.439 --> 10:58.941
What's happening?

10:58.976 --> 11:01.977
Yeah, um, I'm having little
trouble with that last line.

11:02.012 --> 11:05.847
- Just say it. It's funny.
- No, I'm having trouble with your line--

11:05.881 --> 11:08.583
- The way you're reading it.
- The way I'm reading it?

11:08.617 --> 11:10.317
Yeah. Don't read it.
Just act it.

11:10.351 --> 11:12.552
Is this guy joking?!

11:12.586 --> 11:14.587
Well, if you don't seem
panicked, how can I act scared?

11:14.621 --> 11:17.489
- Guys, please.
- You don't think I seemed panicked?

11:17.524 --> 11:19.691
Well, I don't think
you seemed anything.

11:19.726 --> 11:21.126
I mean, what choices
were you making?

11:21.160 --> 11:23.228
Billy, can I have a
word with you, please?

11:23.262 --> 11:25.997
What? I'm in here making choices.
You're just making voices.

11:26.031 --> 11:27.899
What actions were you playing?
I can't even tell.

11:27.933 --> 11:31.135
Billy, a <i>word</i>
before I kill this guy.

11:31.169 --> 11:34.204
Okay, there's no reason to get angry.
I'm just trying to make this work, bro.

11:34.238 --> 11:35.605
You can't make it work
'cause you suck.

11:35.639 --> 11:39.508
Oh, <i>I</i> suck?
No, I think "Viking Quest" sucked.

11:39.542 --> 11:42.878
- You calm down, Drama. Calm down.
- Calm down?!

11:42.912 --> 11:45.513
This guy not only sucks, but
he thinks he's Sandy Meisner.

11:45.548 --> 11:47.548
- Let's just get it done.
- <i>Get what done?!</i>

11:47.583 --> 11:49.383
This show is over
if we don't do something.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.618
- What would you like to do?
- Get Dice back!

11:51.652 --> 11:55.354
- That's not gonna happen. The network
won't pay him. - You like this guy?

11:55.389 --> 11:57.323
- Of course not.
- Then we need to make it happen.

11:57.357 --> 11:59.725
If there was something I could do,
don't you think I would have done it?

11:59.759 --> 12:03.128
- I would give anything to have Dice back.
- Anything?

12:03.162 --> 12:04.929
Give him a piece
of your salary.

12:04.963 --> 12:06.797
Fuck that.
Give him your salary.

12:08.166 --> 12:10.633
Yeah, maybe I will.

12:11.869 --> 12:14.704
- How is it so far?
- So far so good.

12:14.738 --> 12:16.305
- Are you almost done?
- No.

12:16.339 --> 12:19.708
- Ari, leave her alone.
- Where's Taylor?

12:19.742 --> 12:23.144
He didn't come,
but his friend did.

12:23.178 --> 12:25.579
- He wrote it?
- No, that's a different friend.

12:25.614 --> 12:28.782
My daughter is gonna be more
heartbroken than you are, trust me.

12:28.816 --> 12:31.251
I-- I thought

12:31.285 --> 12:33.986
- you were gonna get through this quickly.
- If you'd <i>shut</i> up.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.654
<i>Seriously, Ari.</i>

12:35.688 --> 12:39.258
Seriously? Now you're
in a meeting? Let's go.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.360
- Where's Taylor?
- He's not coming.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.994
Yeah. We're gonna to the next
"Vampire" set though, honey.

12:44.028 --> 12:45.895
Don't you worry.
I'm gonna be right with you guys.

12:45.930 --> 12:48.831
- Hi guys. I'm Dana.
- Hi.

12:48.865 --> 12:50.566
Are you the Dana
that our mom hates?

12:50.600 --> 12:53.469
What?! No!
Mom doesn't hate anyone.

12:53.503 --> 12:55.538
No. No. Dana is just
someone daddy works with.

12:55.572 --> 12:57.473
That's right.

12:57.507 --> 13:00.776
I'll be with you guys in a little bit.
All right.

13:00.810 --> 13:02.711
- Actually, I'm done.
- You are?

13:02.745 --> 13:05.746
- You heard her, Barbara.
- All right, I'll leave you two to discuss.

13:05.781 --> 13:07.681
Come to my
office when you're done.

13:07.715 --> 13:10.217
- Do you even have an office here?
- Fuck you.

13:10.251 --> 13:12.986
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

13:13.020 --> 13:16.421
- I didn't make it weird.
- It just <i>is</i> weird.

13:16.456 --> 13:18.856
Your wife hates me?
Your kids know?

13:18.891 --> 13:21.459
This is so humiliating.
I did nothing wrong!

13:21.493 --> 13:24.795
Of course you didn't. Maybe <i>I</i> did.
I'm sorry. It's <i>confusing.</i>

13:24.829 --> 13:28.298
Listen, if it was just you and me,
it wouldn't be, but I have a family.

13:28.332 --> 13:30.599
- I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
- I didn't ask you

13:30.634 --> 13:34.036
- to do anything.
- But we can't let this jeopardize our business.

13:34.070 --> 13:36.404
I don't intend on it, okay?
Right now, I just have to leave.

13:36.439 --> 13:38.940
You're right.
I can't separate what happened

13:38.975 --> 13:40.641
and what's happening right now.

13:40.676 --> 13:42.510
So you're gonna miss
out on buying this?

13:42.544 --> 13:44.411
I'll buy it.

13:44.445 --> 13:45.745
You didn't even read it.

13:45.780 --> 13:47.914
Well, that's why
I'm a studio head--

13:47.948 --> 13:50.650
because I can do
whatever the fuck I want.

13:52.819 --> 13:55.955
Yes, I suppose I believe in Melinda, which
is why I'm willing to work with her

13:55.989 --> 13:57.723
so <i>you</i> don't have a conflict.

13:57.757 --> 13:59.858
No offense, but she asked
for me, not you, all right?

13:59.892 --> 14:02.494
And you walking out of the meeting
today didn't exactly help your case.

14:02.528 --> 14:04.429
- Okay, so you do it. I don't give a fuck.
- Oh, you don't?

14:04.463 --> 14:07.131
You should. I mean, who was the
last person you signed, Scott?

14:07.165 --> 14:09.099
The third ballerina from the
left in "The Black Swan"?

14:09.134 --> 14:10.901
Yeah. She got signed
and I got sucked.

14:10.935 --> 14:13.770
- You're not serious.
- No, I'm not serious.

14:13.804 --> 14:15.838
Are you really questioning
my work right now

14:15.873 --> 14:18.007
or are you just projecting
your own stress?

14:19.242 --> 14:20.609
I don't wanna piss
Sloan off, okay?

14:20.643 --> 14:23.578
You see that? You see that?
See, that is your biggest fault.

14:23.612 --> 14:26.114
- What? Caring about people?
- No. Caring about a woman

14:26.148 --> 14:28.682
- who destroyed you.
- Do I look destroyed?

14:28.717 --> 14:30.885
I don't know.
You started out looking like this.

14:30.919 --> 14:33.287
- Whatever.
- One more time--

14:33.321 --> 14:37.157
I'm gonna ask you again:
Do you want Sloan back?

14:37.191 --> 14:40.127
- Again, no.
- Great! So let's move on.

14:40.161 --> 14:43.296
Start looking out for E
and looking out for me.

14:43.331 --> 14:44.998
All right, you're right.

14:45.033 --> 14:47.267
I will call Melinda.
I will lock it down.

14:47.302 --> 14:51.438
I like it. You see this? You're becoming 
the destroyer, not the destroyee!

14:51.472 --> 14:53.874
- Uh-huh.
- Pay attention, everybody!

14:53.908 --> 14:55.708
This is a gentleman.

14:55.743 --> 14:59.946
- Says Sophia Lear got a first from Oxford.
- What's a first?

14:59.980 --> 15:02.481
I don't know.
It's gotta be better than a second.

15:02.516 --> 15:04.049
Oxford is a pretty good school.

15:04.084 --> 15:06.085
Where do you think we would have
gone if we went to college?

15:06.119 --> 15:08.420
- Probably not Oxford.
- No, probably not.

15:08.454 --> 15:09.487
What else you got?

15:09.522 --> 15:12.256
- I got a nude image of her.
- Really?

15:12.290 --> 15:14.924
Yeah, but I'm pretty
sure it's doctored.

15:14.959 --> 15:16.525
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I doctored it.

15:16.559 --> 15:19.159
<i>Great site--</i>
<i>headandbody.com.</i>

15:19.194 --> 15:22.527
You take the head of the girl you like,
match it with a great nude photo...

15:22.561 --> 15:24.028
- She looks good.
- I'm an artist.

15:24.063 --> 15:25.463
<i>Uh, hello?</i>

15:25.497 --> 15:27.197
- Hello.
- Vince.

15:27.232 --> 15:30.033
- <i>Sophia. Hi.</i>
- Hi. I hope you weren't holding long.

15:30.067 --> 15:32.401
Is 45 minutes long?

15:32.436 --> 15:35.737
- Funny. So anyway, how can I help you?
- Well, to be straightforward,

15:35.772 --> 15:37.840
what Shauna heard of our interview,
she wasn't happy with.

15:37.874 --> 15:41.043
- And you?
- I thought we had a nice rapport,

15:41.077 --> 15:43.412
- but I guess we didn't get too deep.
- No, not really.

15:43.446 --> 15:44.947
I'm sorry.
I-I was nervous.

15:44.981 --> 15:47.448
- Oh, you seemed confident.
- <i>Well, that was a cover.</i>

15:47.483 --> 15:49.250
- For what?
- For my nervousness.

15:49.284 --> 15:51.618
I understand.
Unfortunately,

15:51.686 --> 15:55.188
I'm not sure that I'll be able to
turn our discussion into an article.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.123
Any chance
I can get a second shot?

15:57.157 --> 15:58.824
- You can come here.
- Where's here?

15:58.858 --> 16:01.626
<i>My hotel.</i>
<i>I'll be more relaxed.</i>

16:01.661 --> 16:04.128
Oh, no. No, I'm not sure that's
appropriate.

16:04.163 --> 16:07.830
Aw, I'm sure you interview lots of people
at their houses or rooms or whatever.

16:07.864 --> 16:10.798
Yes, but not ones who
have been propositioning me.

16:10.833 --> 16:13.434
You thought I was
propositioning you?

16:13.468 --> 16:16.736
<i>I-I'm sorry. I was</i>
<i>more trying to deflect</i>

16:16.771 --> 16:19.205
<i>because some of your</i>
<i>questions kind of scared me.</i>

16:19.240 --> 16:21.107
- So you'll answer them now?
- <i>Absolutely.</i>

16:21.141 --> 16:24.009
- All of them. I promise.
- All right.

16:24.043 --> 16:26.845
- I'll see you in an hour, Vince.
- Okay.

16:28.914 --> 16:31.548
<i>Fuck you with</i>
<i>"You don't understand."</i>

16:31.583 --> 16:36.052
<i>Let me explain it to you in
old-school Brooklyn ingles, okay?</i>

16:36.086 --> 16:39.654
You owe me $789, okay?

16:39.689 --> 16:42.625
Yeah. Louie,
Louie, pay attention.

16:42.659 --> 16:46.361
I'm gonna go to my bank, take
out every fucking nickel I got

16:46.396 --> 16:48.496
just to sue your fucking ass.

16:48.531 --> 16:51.532
Oh, that doesn't
work for you? Huh?

16:51.566 --> 16:53.533
Kiss my fucking asshole lips!

16:54.902 --> 16:56.536
- You okay?
- Fucking douche, brother.

16:56.570 --> 16:58.238
Other than that,
I'm good. You?

16:58.272 --> 17:00.973
- We need to talk.
- Did you walk off the show?

17:01.007 --> 17:03.441
- No.
- Yeah, then there's nothing to talk about.

17:03.476 --> 17:06.344
- Dice.
- Drama, when a group goes on strike,

17:06.377 --> 17:08.244
the whole group needs
to stick together.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.913
Yeah, but I didn't agree
to go on strike.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.983
- Scab.
- Don't call me a scab. I'm not a scab.

17:13.017 --> 17:15.852
- Yeah? Then what are you?
- A desperate actor

17:15.887 --> 17:18.988
because the show I know could be a
huge hit is going down on flames

17:19.022 --> 17:20.923
if you don't wake up.

17:20.958 --> 17:23.192
Yeah, I thought
they replaced me.

17:23.227 --> 17:25.161
What are you doing?
I thought you quit like 10 years ago.

17:25.194 --> 17:28.663
- I did, I'm just fucking stressed.
- Because of this?

17:28.697 --> 17:31.732
- No. My son Dylan.
- Is he okay?

17:31.766 --> 17:34.201
Got into Princeton.

17:34.235 --> 17:37.670
Do you believe this dumbfuck's son
got into an Ivy League school?

17:37.704 --> 17:41.740
- Well, that's great, right?
- Well, problem is, I can't afford it.

17:41.774 --> 17:44.442
- That's why you gotta come back to work.
- No.

17:44.477 --> 17:46.711
I can't come back to work because
they're not paying me enough.

17:46.745 --> 17:48.746
I'm gonna have to go on the
road seven nights a week

17:48.780 --> 17:51.315
just to pay for his school.
But I will.

17:51.349 --> 17:52.983
Dice, you don't
have to do that.

17:53.017 --> 17:55.718
- No? Why not?
- 'Cause that's why I came here,

17:55.752 --> 17:59.988
to offer you the difference in my
salary from yours, make us even.

18:00.022 --> 18:01.990
We'd both would be
at 10k an episode.

18:02.024 --> 18:04.658
You wanna offer me your money?

18:04.693 --> 18:06.160
Yeah.

18:06.194 --> 18:08.695
Wow, Drama.

18:09.830 --> 18:11.563
Nobody's ever been
that selfless.

18:11.598 --> 18:13.765
- So you'll come back to work?
- No.

18:13.800 --> 18:17.769
- Why not?!
- Because <i>they</i> need to pay me, not you.

18:17.803 --> 18:19.804
And the truth is,
I think they're going to.

18:19.838 --> 18:21.438
- Based on what?
- Gut feeling.

18:21.473 --> 18:25.108
- Dice, they replaced you.
- With a guy that sucks buffalo dick.

18:25.143 --> 18:27.277
- It's a bluff!
- No, it's not.

18:27.311 --> 18:30.613
We're airing in three weeks.
They're replacing all the stuff you did today.

18:30.647 --> 18:34.116
- Look, I reached out to my old agent, 
Mike Ovitz. - What did he say?

18:34.150 --> 18:36.751
He hasn't called me
back yet, but he will.

18:36.786 --> 18:39.253
And when Ovitz makes a
move, the earth shakes.

18:39.287 --> 18:42.054
- Dice.
- Drama, listen,

18:42.089 --> 18:45.090
my dad always said,
"Drama's a real friend."

18:45.124 --> 18:47.925
And I'll never forget your offer,
but I know what I'm supposed to get

18:47.959 --> 18:49.826
and I know who's supposed
to give it to me.

18:49.861 --> 18:54.496
And I will not accept
not getting it.

18:56.099 --> 18:58.900
Well, I am so
excited about this.

18:58.934 --> 19:00.868
- I think we're gonna make a great team.
- Agreed.

19:00.902 --> 19:03.803
I can't wait to get back to work.
It's just--

19:03.838 --> 19:07.206
Well, when you come out of a controlling
relationship like I was in,

19:07.240 --> 19:09.408
one that basically
sabotaged my career,

19:09.443 --> 19:11.244
it's sometimes tough
to move forward.

19:11.278 --> 19:14.147
We're gonna find you something great.
We're gonna move forward quickly,

19:14.181 --> 19:15.482
- Melinda, I promise.
- Thanks.

19:15.516 --> 19:17.452
- And what about you?
- What about me?

19:17.486 --> 19:19.488
- Have you moved forward?
- Absolutely.

19:19.523 --> 19:22.824
Well, what happened?
Why did you and Sloan break up?

19:22.859 --> 19:25.026
- I don't wanna talk about that.
- Did she cheat on you?

19:25.061 --> 19:27.395
- No.
- It's in that family's blood.

19:27.429 --> 19:29.730
Well, she didn't cheat on me.
We had a mutual break-up.

19:29.765 --> 19:32.800
Uh. <i> Nothing</i> with the
McQuewicks is ever mutual.

19:32.834 --> 19:36.236
She kind of pushed me into it,
but in the end I agreed.

19:36.270 --> 19:39.171
Sure. When I found out Terrance
was fucking around on me,

19:39.206 --> 19:43.107
I agreed we were done. I don't think
Sloan was ever in my corner anyway.

19:43.141 --> 19:46.210
- I thought you liked Sloan.
- As much as you can like an ice princess.

19:46.244 --> 19:48.445
Oh come on, she's
not an ice princess.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.681
Oh come on, Eric,
she's a little cold.

19:50.715 --> 19:53.016
Can we have two more of these
when you get a second?

19:53.050 --> 19:55.051
Thanks.

19:55.085 --> 19:56.953
You're not over it.

19:56.987 --> 20:01.256
No. Well, I tell people I am, but I'm not.
No one believes me.

20:01.291 --> 20:05.027
- You know, we were gonna get married.
I wanted to. - Then what happened?

20:05.061 --> 20:06.696
Terrance asked me
to sign a prenup.

20:06.730 --> 20:08.698
Ah, must've wised up after me.

20:08.733 --> 20:10.667
Who knows?
She probably wanted me to also.

20:10.701 --> 20:12.869
It got ugly though.
I mean, I destroyed Murray.

20:12.903 --> 20:15.171
Whatever.
The past is the past

20:15.205 --> 20:17.506
and I am moving
forward, so. Cheers.

20:17.540 --> 20:19.674
Well, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have brought it up,

20:19.709 --> 20:22.610
but you're a sweet guy, Eric.

20:22.644 --> 20:24.478
Sloan was lucky to have you.

20:24.513 --> 20:26.680
God, I've never had a guy
as committed as you.

20:26.715 --> 20:29.850
If she didn't appreciate it,
that's all there is to focus on.

20:29.884 --> 20:32.052
If it wasn't the prenup, it
would have been something else.

20:32.086 --> 20:34.987
- You think?
- I know.

20:35.022 --> 20:37.756
- Ah, who knows? Maybe she is a little cold.
- There you go.

20:37.790 --> 20:39.257
And in the future

20:39.292 --> 20:42.860
- we'll find someone to warm you up.
- Great.

20:42.895 --> 20:45.829
And maybe find me someone who doesn't
need a pill every five minutes

20:45.897 --> 20:48.165
- to keep me warm.
- Wow.

20:49.167 --> 20:50.800
I am really sorry, you guys.

20:50.835 --> 20:54.337
- I am gonna make it up o you. How about Hawaii?
- Will Taylor come there?

20:54.371 --> 20:56.271
Him and Robert Pattinson.

20:56.306 --> 21:00.075
- Quit while you're ahead, dad. 
We still love you. - I love you guys too.

21:00.109 --> 21:02.177
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, mom.

21:02.211 --> 21:04.546
- What happened?
- I-I couldn't get out of the office.

21:04.580 --> 21:06.214
- Oh, Ari.
- I'm sorry.

21:06.249 --> 21:08.883
And I'm sorry that I brought Dana
to the restaurant the other night.

21:08.917 --> 21:10.918
But please stop
poisoning the kids.

21:10.952 --> 21:12.519
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Okay, look,

21:12.553 --> 21:14.421
let's just regroup, okay?
I'm sorry.

21:14.455 --> 21:17.056
My behavior has been bad.
I'm unraveling.

21:17.090 --> 21:20.025
- I don't like not knowing what's happening.
- What's to know?

21:20.060 --> 21:22.827
- You're in the office with your girlfriend.
- She's the head of a studio.

21:22.862 --> 21:25.430
And how do you think the town would
react if they found out about you two?

21:25.464 --> 21:28.733
There's nothing to find out. And I've already
suffered the brunt of the gossip

21:28.767 --> 21:30.768
because my wife is running
around with Chef Boyardee.

21:30.802 --> 21:33.604
But I didn't disappoint the kids.
But that's nothing new.

21:33.638 --> 21:36.039
This has always been the problem.
Girlfriend or not,

21:36.074 --> 21:37.774
work has always
trumped family for you.

21:37.808 --> 21:41.510
I am trying to do the right
thing, but you won't let me.

21:41.545 --> 21:44.346
You say you've changed, but
today is the perfect example

21:44.380 --> 21:46.014
of how worthless
your words are.

21:46.049 --> 21:48.250
What do you wanna do?

21:48.284 --> 21:49.784
Oh, I did what I want to do.

21:49.818 --> 21:53.053
I called a lawyer and
I'm filing for divorce.

21:57.358 --> 22:00.226
So if the network thinks
this guy sucks also,

22:00.260 --> 22:03.162
- why won't they do something?
- Because they're not gonna get pushed around

22:03.196 --> 22:06.498
- by Andrew Dice Clay.
- Oh, so this is just about ego?

22:06.533 --> 22:09.401
That's how this town
goes sometimes. Yeah.

22:09.436 --> 22:12.237
Is this guy like Moonves's
nephew or something?

22:12.271 --> 22:13.905
- What? No.
- Is he yours?

22:13.940 --> 22:16.407
No! No. But he was
brought in on budget

22:16.442 --> 22:18.542
because we burned so much
money doing all this stuff

22:18.576 --> 22:21.978
- with Dice.
- Jesus Christ, Phil! On a budget now?

22:22.012 --> 22:24.713
- I don't--
- This show could be so great.

22:24.747 --> 22:26.381
I know that more
than I know anything.

22:26.416 --> 22:28.049
- I know, I know.
- But it needs both of us.

22:28.084 --> 22:30.885
Can you imagine "The Flintstones"
without Barney,

22:30.920 --> 22:33.421
"The Honeymooners"
without Ed Norton?

22:33.455 --> 22:35.056
- Would they work?
- I don't know.

22:35.123 --> 22:37.658
And you're depressing the shit
out of me because I agree,

22:37.692 --> 22:40.560
but you know what?
I'm not sure the network does.

22:40.595 --> 22:42.696
What do you mean?

22:42.730 --> 22:44.630
Forget the budget.
Maybe it's ego,

22:44.665 --> 22:47.733
maybe it's not.
I don't wanna make your ego any crazier.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.768
That's not possible.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.370
But they don't see
the show like you do.

22:52.404 --> 22:54.405
They don't see a buddy show.
They love Dice,

22:54.440 --> 22:57.574
but they see you
really carrying it.

22:57.608 --> 23:01.511
If this show goes, they'll really just
tailor the whole thing around you.

23:02.412 --> 23:04.146
Wow.

23:04.180 --> 23:07.182
- I don't think I've ever heard that.
- Feels good, doesn't it?

23:07.216 --> 23:10.485
- Yeah, it feels great.
- Yeah.

23:10.519 --> 23:12.720
Ah, but-- but I'm
not buying it though.

23:12.754 --> 23:15.989
Need Dice. We're a magical
combination together.

23:16.024 --> 23:17.957
- I know it!
- What are you gonna do?

23:20.060 --> 23:22.361
I guess what I have to do.

23:22.395 --> 23:26.131
Since they believe in me,
I'm walking also.

23:30.503 --> 23:33.704
What put you in Carl
Ertz's house that night?

23:33.739 --> 23:35.272
Honestly, work.

23:35.307 --> 23:38.241
I wanted to get this project going
for my brother and he was into it.

23:38.276 --> 23:40.743
Did you really not see what
an unstable person he was?

23:40.778 --> 23:43.179
- You trusted that he was capable of helping you.
- He was an addict

23:43.213 --> 23:46.081
- and I wanted to give him a chance.
- Like you want another chance?

23:46.116 --> 23:47.849
- Yes.
- So in hindsight,

23:47.884 --> 23:50.752
do you regret putting
yourself in that position?

23:50.786 --> 23:52.253
I don't follow.

23:52.287 --> 23:54.355
Well, you risked your
own salvation for a man

23:54.389 --> 23:56.090
that ultimately
didn't care about yours.

23:56.124 --> 23:57.491
So be it.

23:57.525 --> 23:59.526
Do think that in some way
had something to do

23:59.560 --> 24:01.461
with your father abandoning
you and your family?

24:01.495 --> 24:04.397
- I think that's a stretch.
- Perhaps,

24:04.431 --> 24:06.232
but you said yourself
if he showed up today

24:06.266 --> 24:07.666
you'd welcome him
back into your life.

24:07.700 --> 24:10.035
- I didn't say that.
- So you wouldn't?

24:10.069 --> 24:12.236
I'd help him financially
if he needed it.

24:12.271 --> 24:13.938
But you are angry with him?

24:13.972 --> 24:15.940
I wouldn't
change my childhood--

24:15.974 --> 24:18.909
Not even the memory of him walking out
at dinner without saying goodbye.

24:18.943 --> 24:21.078
Why is that?

24:21.112 --> 24:24.180
I was raised by my mother,
my grandmother and my aunt.

24:24.215 --> 24:25.882
They gave me the strength.

24:25.916 --> 24:28.384
And it's because of them, I think,
that I have an appreciation

24:28.418 --> 24:30.085
and respect for women
most men don't have.

24:30.120 --> 24:33.088
Even porn stars?

24:33.122 --> 24:35.824
I never judged Sasha
for what she did.

24:35.858 --> 24:39.360
I always saw her for the beautiful,
intelligent woman she is.

24:39.394 --> 24:40.961
Would she corroborate that?

24:40.996 --> 24:44.497
Like most relationships, we had our
problems and, unfortunately for her,

24:44.532 --> 24:46.066
she saw me in my darkest days.

24:46.100 --> 24:49.668
She deserved better than me
and I hope she finds it.

24:49.703 --> 24:52.637
- Thank you for your honesty.
- Thanks for the second chance.

24:52.672 --> 24:54.606
Turtle, see you soon.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.674
- Good to see you again.
- I'll be in touch.

24:56.708 --> 24:59.043
Do you wanna grab a drink?

24:59.077 --> 25:01.445
No, I don't think
that would be right.

25:01.479 --> 25:04.180
But you know all about me now
and I know nothing about you.

25:04.215 --> 25:06.916
Yes.
That's because I'm the journalist

25:06.950 --> 25:08.617
and you're the subject.

25:08.652 --> 25:10.786
I just thought since I managed
to stay professional,

25:10.820 --> 25:12.354
we could get to know
each other now.

25:12.388 --> 25:15.023
Mr. Chase, I'm flattered, but
I take my work very seriously

25:15.057 --> 25:17.291
and I really wouldn't want to
compromise that for a fleeting desire.

25:17.325 --> 25:19.159
After all, desire attained
is not in fact desire.

25:19.194 --> 25:21.628
Can you please respect that?

25:21.662 --> 25:23.930
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

25:28.735 --> 25:32.671
- She's a tough one, huh?
- I love her.

25:32.705 --> 25:35.707
Do you know that Terrance still has
nannies come to the house on Halloween

25:35.741 --> 25:37.608
- to handle the trick-or-treaters?
- Oh, come on.

25:37.643 --> 25:39.943
- Yeah. - Which is probably why Sloan
is the way she is.

25:39.978 --> 25:41.678
Oh, that and the fact
that he gives her

25:41.713 --> 25:45.715
- a $200,000-a-month allowance.
- Well, she has a job.

25:45.749 --> 25:48.618
- Doing what?
- Planning parties for charities.

25:51.989 --> 25:54.390
- Oh boy.
- Oh my goodness,

25:54.424 --> 25:56.124
I have not laughed
like this in years.

25:56.158 --> 25:58.392
Oh, I have.
Sloan's a laugh a minute.

25:58.426 --> 26:00.393
- You've got to hear her.
- I'm sad.

26:00.428 --> 26:03.362
- You're drunk.
- That is true.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.230
Why don't we call a cab,
get you home?

26:07.967 --> 26:10.235
You've never needed Viagra,
have you, Eric?

26:11.904 --> 26:15.138
<i>Hey, it's Dana. Leave a message.</i>

26:18.610 --> 26:22.247
Fuck you, plant.

26:22.281 --> 26:25.817
Fuck you, fucking 20" screen.

26:25.852 --> 26:28.353
Fuck you,

26:28.388 --> 26:30.689
you fucking stupid
fucking balcony!

26:30.724 --> 26:33.626
- <i>Shut the fuck up!</i>
- Fuck you the most!

26:38.399 --> 26:39.666
Hello?

26:39.700 --> 26:41.701
- Ari?
- <i>Dana.</i>

26:41.735 --> 26:44.737
- Hey, how are you?
- Did you just call me?

26:44.771 --> 26:46.939
- It's possible.
- Are you okay?

26:46.973 --> 26:49.008
Uh...

26:49.042 --> 26:51.444
- I don't think so.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

26:51.478 --> 26:54.614
No, it's all right.
What can you do?

26:55.549 --> 26:57.117
I can come over.

26:58.652 --> 27:01.787
Is this some sort of cruel
prank to stick it to me?

27:01.821 --> 27:05.523
Because I cannot deal with
a revenge fuck right now.

27:05.557 --> 27:07.224
Well, maybe I can.

27:07.258 --> 27:09.693
Ari, I'm lonely.

27:09.728 --> 27:13.863
<i>I freaked today and I know
this is complicated,</i>

27:13.898 --> 27:17.133
but I guess what
I'm trying to say is,

27:17.167 --> 27:20.769
I can see how complicated
it is for you too,

27:20.837 --> 27:22.571
so one day at a time.

27:22.605 --> 27:25.606
I'll take my chances
if you still want to.

27:25.641 --> 27:27.841
<i>No pressure.</i>

27:29.877 --> 27:32.111
- We're going to hell.
- No.

27:32.145 --> 27:34.479
- Oh, I am for sure.
- Oh, stop.

27:34.513 --> 27:36.880
We bonded over drunken sharing
and painful memories.

27:36.915 --> 27:39.115
It happens all the time.

27:39.150 --> 27:40.816
I actually feel better.

27:40.851 --> 27:42.885
I do too.

27:42.919 --> 27:45.086
So we used each other.

27:45.121 --> 27:46.921
Yeah, no big deal.

27:46.955 --> 27:51.758
You can get that. I won't take it personally.

27:56.197 --> 27:58.031
Hello?

27:58.065 --> 28:00.900
Please tell me you didn't
meet with Melinda.

28:00.934 --> 28:02.934
- Sloan?
- <i>My father just called</i>

28:02.968 --> 28:06.068
to tell me that Melinda emailed
him that she was gonna fuck you.

28:06.103 --> 28:07.869
That's just nuts.

28:07.903 --> 28:10.004
- <i>Did you meet her?</i>
- Yeah, I met her.

28:10.038 --> 28:12.139
- She asked me to represent her, that's all.
- And you didn't think

28:12.174 --> 28:14.275
- to ask me? - Well, I did, and then
the thought occurred to me

28:14.309 --> 28:16.610
that you and I aren't in each other's
lives anymore. So what's the point?

28:18.379 --> 28:21.480
There's no point, Eric.
Goodbye.

28:22.549 --> 28:24.083
Uh-oh.

28:28.021 --> 28:30.755
Did you meet with me just
to get back at Terrance?

28:30.789 --> 28:35.626
Maybe at first, but then I
had a really great time.

28:36.962 --> 28:39.763
You're still gonna be
my manager though, right?
