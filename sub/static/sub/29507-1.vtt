01:50.277 --> 01:51.277
Ugh.

02:17.872 --> 02:18.937
It's here.

02:27.681 --> 02:28.681
Oh.

04:16.257 --> 04:19.224
Bravo!

04:19.226 --> 04:20.625
Bravissimo!

04:20.628 --> 04:22.294
That was the perfect finale.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.062
Do you wanna book a gig?

04:24.064 --> 04:25.764
I'm the band manager.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.032
I'm Inspector Bob Gravy

04:27.034 --> 04:30.002
and this is my partner,
Inspector Rosane Grape.

04:30.004 --> 04:32.437
- Homicides.
- Homicides?

04:32.439 --> 04:33.705
Cool!

04:33.707 --> 04:34.973
We'd like to ask
you some questions

04:34.975 --> 04:38.110
about an acquaintance of
yours, Frederico Olsen.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.111
Did he kill someone?

04:39.113 --> 04:41.213
This is my friend, Maxi.

04:41.215 --> 04:43.315
She knows Frederico as well.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.850
So what happened?

04:44.852 --> 04:46.285
Maybe we should sit down.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.989
The neighbor found his dog
playing with a human foot.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.191
It's how we identified
the remains.

04:53.193 --> 04:54.626
The guy was a loony.

04:55.963 --> 04:56.895
One of those guys you just wanna

04:56.897 --> 04:58.163
punch in the face, you know?

04:58.165 --> 05:00.365
Punching someone in
the face is one thing,

05:00.367 --> 05:02.401
cutting them into
pieces is another.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.337
Did he try and
contact you recently?

05:06.240 --> 05:07.240
No.

05:08.542 --> 05:12.110
I filed a restraining order
against him about two years ago.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.812
Things got kind of out of hand.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.683
Frederico was very
dedicated to me.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.784
Dedicated?

05:19.620 --> 05:21.353
The guy was obsessed.

05:21.355 --> 05:24.122
Francesca makes a habit
of attracting weirdos.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.324
Maxi.

05:25.326 --> 05:29.328
They're not weirdos,
they're just dedicated.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.896
Obsessed.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.932
I'm sorry, this is so terrible.

05:38.305 --> 05:41.106
Um, sorry, we've got to go now.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.942
I'm having some
furniture delivered.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.278
Really, what kind of furniture?

05:46.280 --> 05:47.612
Um, a recliner.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.450
We may need to ask
you some more questions,

05:51.452 --> 05:53.051
if that's okay?

05:53.053 --> 05:55.721
Sure, thank you, see ya.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.024
Something about
her, isn't there?

06:00.194 --> 06:01.927
I can see why they
all went crazy.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.063
I don't see it.

06:05.299 --> 06:07.366
I wanna seek out this
restraining order.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.906
Okay, these chains are about
to go, are you guys ready?

06:14.908 --> 06:17.342
Uh, just grab
it by the middle bit.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.181
My hand!

06:23.183 --> 06:25.650
- I'm stuck!
- Pull it up!

06:25.652 --> 06:26.785
Lift it!

06:36.697 --> 06:41.032
Okay, okay, you two,
go, take care of that.

06:41.034 --> 06:44.102
- I'll finish this.
- Okay.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.104
Go now.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.026
I've a delivery
for Francesca Morton.

07:08.028 --> 07:08.960
Francesca?

07:08.962 --> 07:10.195
There's no Francesca here.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.998
Are you sure it
doesn't say Maxi?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.266
That's my granddaughter.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.469
Must have got the wrong address.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.304
This happens all the time.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.940
I should give this
Francesca a call.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.062
Hey, there's blood here!

07:44.064 --> 07:47.032
Yeah, that recliner almost
chopped my mate's finger off.

08:44.658 --> 08:48.059
- You're sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.294
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.228
You were shaking on the ground.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.196
Yeah, you can go.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.431
It must have been the heat.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.499
Now go.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.551
That guy is so
annoying, honestly,

09:12.553 --> 09:14.152
I don't know how you stand him.

09:16.456 --> 09:19.024
I just like him
'cause he's not clingy.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.933
You know he's gay, right?

09:27.935 --> 09:29.968
Yeah yeah yeah,
well that was his fault,

09:29.970 --> 09:32.470
I mean, he wanted to go.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.641
Thanks for the ride, Maxi.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.978
Do you need help
moving the recliner?

09:41.548 --> 09:43.648
- TJ will help me.
- Okay.

09:47.421 --> 09:48.486
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.583
So the cops found pieces of him?

10:18.585 --> 10:20.118
That's pretty rad.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.087
Is that why you're upset?

10:22.089 --> 10:23.321
Of course it is!

10:23.323 --> 10:25.490
This is a horrible thing, TJ.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.759
Don't you think it's
strange what happened?

10:27.761 --> 10:30.061
Not really, me and Josh
were in a cafe one time,

10:30.063 --> 10:31.997
caught the dude taking
photos of us.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.465
Why would he take
pictures of you?

10:33.467 --> 10:35.533
He's just a weirdo.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.838
Can you please
stay home tonight?

10:39.840 --> 10:42.007
Come on, baby, you
know I can't do that.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.241
Michael's getting
married tomorrow

10:43.243 --> 10:44.923
and me and Josh are
gonna take him to town.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.812
We could take a shower together.

10:47.814 --> 10:48.814
I'm sorry.

11:05.732 --> 11:06.831
Okay, bye!

11:08.502 --> 11:09.701
Don't wait up for me!

11:20.047 --> 11:21.846
Oi, Grandad.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.183
Grandad?

11:25.385 --> 11:26.651
Jack?

11:26.653 --> 11:28.119
Hmm?

11:28.121 --> 11:29.587
What's up?

11:29.589 --> 11:33.258
Oh, just something that
happened at the shop.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.859
It's probably nothing.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.096
Hey, I was thinking
about the shop.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.464
What do you reckon?

11:39.466 --> 11:41.733
I think we should create
a page on your website

11:41.735 --> 11:43.802
where people can
put the dimensions

11:43.804 --> 11:45.570
of the furniture that they want.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.006
That's important, Grandad,
because people buy antiques

11:48.008 --> 11:49.874
mostly to decorate their house

11:50.844 --> 11:52.110
and houses are getting smaller,

11:52.112 --> 11:53.878
there's not enough space, so.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.653
You sure it was a dybbuk?

12:01.655 --> 12:04.489
Yes, and a strong one as well.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.226
I saw a young woman
running through a forest,

12:09.696 --> 12:13.198
some people were chasing
her, she was in danger.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.201
Jack, you know what this means?

12:17.704 --> 12:19.771
That you have the
gift like your father.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.725
Foxy body you have!

13:15.028 --> 13:17.128
Maxi, what are you doing?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.731
You told me to come over.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.600
Are you okay?

13:23.637 --> 13:24.637
Yeah.

13:25.739 --> 13:28.373
Just felt like there
was somebody else here.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.547
What's that smell?

13:35.549 --> 13:37.348
Oh shit, the popcorn.

14:12.919 --> 14:13.919
Jealous lover?

14:15.288 --> 14:16.288
Maybe.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.457
A secret.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.794
Well, you like cars,
I like collecting secrets.

14:22.796 --> 14:25.530
Might have to close the store.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.532
Why?

14:27.667 --> 14:28.833
Too many debts.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.337
The antique business
isn't really doing so well

14:32.339 --> 14:33.872
and I've been trying to
get some jobs on the side

14:33.874 --> 14:35.506
but it's not really cutting it.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.110
You should focus
on your music, Maxi.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.081
You're really talented.

14:50.824 --> 14:55.526
It's beautiful, but
I can't accept it.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.867
Thanks for coming over, Maxi.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.604
Stop thinking about
Frederico, okay?

15:06.606 --> 15:08.673
What happened to him
was not your fault.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.111
Come here.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.765
As you know, the dybbuk
is a powerful spirit

18:54.767 --> 18:56.167
that feeds on the living.

18:57.337 --> 19:00.171
First thing to remember
is never touch it.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.174
If you have touched a dybbuk,

19:03.176 --> 19:05.343
you have established
a connection

19:05.345 --> 19:07.578
and opened a door
to allow the beast

19:07.580 --> 19:10.815
to enter your body
and your mind.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.383
If you have touched a dybbuk,

19:12.385 --> 19:15.753
you may soon experience
strange health problems

19:15.755 --> 19:20.691
such as hives, coughing up
blood, head to toe welts,

19:20.693 --> 19:24.896
crushing chest pains,
paralyzing headaches.

19:24.898 --> 19:27.265
Don't even attempt
to face a dybbuk

19:27.267 --> 19:29.200
unless you are in
perfect health,

19:29.202 --> 19:32.236
physically and
especially mentally,

19:32.238 --> 19:37.308
for it is the weak-willed
mind that will first succumb

19:38.545 --> 19:41.412
to the spirit's flirtations
and manipulations.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.692
TJ?

21:01.427 --> 21:03.160
Okay, what was that for?

21:03.162 --> 21:06.364
For understanding
a girl's needs.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.566
Huh, okay.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.668
You didn't make
yourself anything though.

21:10.670 --> 21:11.670
I'll do it.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.472
- Cereal?
- Yeah, sure.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.082
What did you get
up to last night?

21:27.153 --> 21:29.420
I just stayed at home with Maxi.

21:29.422 --> 21:32.590
I was really sad about
Frederico, you know?

21:32.592 --> 21:34.191
I even had nights.

21:35.595 --> 21:36.595
Oh, okay.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.032
Are you okay?

21:42.602 --> 21:46.971
Yeah, I'm just a little
more drunk than I thought.

21:50.710 --> 21:53.344
And you still had time
to bake cookies for me.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.614
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

22:58.578 --> 22:59.844
What a freak.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.547
Did you know Frederico
was into voodoo?

23:04.817 --> 23:06.851
And that he even had a blog?

23:06.853 --> 23:10.621
He had a lot of phases,
Inspector, I'm not sure.

23:10.623 --> 23:14.792
Have you been feeling
okay health-wise?

23:15.895 --> 23:18.629
Yes, why do you ask?

23:18.631 --> 23:20.498
Just asking, that's all.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.401
We saw that you had
filed restraining orders

23:23.403 --> 23:25.369
against some of these
men in the past.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.839
We also see in each
restraining order

23:28.841 --> 23:30.908
you seem to provide
a different address.

23:32.145 --> 23:34.011
The only constant
thing in my life

23:35.114 --> 23:38.015
is my dancing and
my friend Maxi.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.988
Look, I know what
you're thinking.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.689
I know this looks strange

23:45.691 --> 23:48.559
and it is very strange.

23:48.561 --> 23:51.829
See, ever since I can remember,

23:52.965 --> 23:57.067
I've had this effect on
men and sometimes women.

23:58.738 --> 24:02.640
But men especially just seem
to get very attached to me.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.943
You mean they become
obsessed with you?

24:07.180 --> 24:09.580
- Yes.
- I already told you this.

24:09.582 --> 24:12.983
So, have you had romantic
relationships with these men?

24:14.020 --> 24:16.954
With some of
them, but Frederico?

24:16.956 --> 24:19.757
No, we were just friends.

24:19.759 --> 24:24.528
Of course, he wanted more,
they always want more.

24:24.530 --> 24:27.097
Did any of these men
ever show violent behavior?

24:28.468 --> 24:31.035
I don't know, what do you
mean by violent behavior?

24:32.138 --> 24:34.371
Did they ever slap
you or punch you?

24:35.341 --> 24:37.441
Yeah, I guess.

24:37.443 --> 24:38.476
You guess?

24:39.579 --> 24:41.912
You know how it
goes in the bedroom,

24:41.914 --> 24:46.650
sometimes things get a little
violent, but it's okay.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.453
Francesca, violence
is never okay.

24:49.455 --> 24:51.789
Did you ever report
any of those incidents?

24:51.791 --> 24:54.825
No, I don't mean
that sort of violence.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.995
I mean, the sort of
violence that happens

24:57.997 --> 25:01.165
when there's sexual tension.

25:04.203 --> 25:07.638
Like I said, I've always
had this effect on men.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.940
It's like they go crazy
for me or something.

25:11.844 --> 25:16.714
Well, what about your,
um, your current partner?

25:16.716 --> 25:17.648
TJ?

25:17.650 --> 25:21.452
No, he's somehow immune to me,

25:22.522 --> 25:26.290
sexually, I mean, but
it's a good thing.

25:27.793 --> 25:28.793
He's gay.

25:32.298 --> 25:36.100
I just don't want people to
get hurt anymore, Inspector.

25:57.890 --> 25:58.890
Aw yeah.

26:42.735 --> 26:43.735
Ah, fuck!

26:46.038 --> 26:47.038
Fuck!

26:51.077 --> 26:53.177
You know, when
she's running around,

26:53.179 --> 26:56.046
she never stops screaming,
every time she sees the baddie,

26:56.048 --> 26:57.514
it's the screaming,
it's so cliched.

26:57.516 --> 27:00.084
He looks awful, poor Frederico.

27:00.086 --> 27:01.352
It's the same thing

27:01.354 --> 27:03.153
I've seen for years
and years and years.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.489
It's just crap, basically.

27:05.491 --> 27:07.825
And the lead actor...
TJ, what is it?

27:07.827 --> 27:08.827
I can't talk now.

27:09.562 --> 27:11.595
I just hated him.

27:11.597 --> 27:13.097
What?

27:13.099 --> 27:14.598
TJ?

28:04.517 --> 28:05.616
What?

28:05.618 --> 28:07.151
Shalom, Abba.

28:07.153 --> 28:08.719
No, what do you want?

28:09.689 --> 28:10.954
I think I've found a dybbuk.

28:10.956 --> 28:13.190
Ugh, you are not prepared...

28:14.326 --> 28:15.759
Abba.

28:15.761 --> 28:17.027
Or educated...

28:17.029 --> 28:18.696
Abba, listen to me.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.764
To deal with these matters.

28:20.766 --> 28:23.967
You're dealing with things
that you don't understand.

28:23.969 --> 28:26.870
Abba, I'm your
son, I have the gift.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.372
You don't have the gift.

28:28.374 --> 28:31.975
You don't even have the right
to call yourself a rabbi.

28:31.977 --> 28:35.012
Oh, here we go again, we've
talked about this already.

28:35.014 --> 28:38.115
I'm more than capable of
doing what we need to do.

28:38.117 --> 28:42.386
People will get
hurt if you try to intervene.

28:44.490 --> 28:48.792
Abba, I think the
dybbuk will try to do...

28:48.794 --> 28:51.328
Let it do what it has to do.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.931
Let other people deal with it.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.366
Dad!

28:56.368 --> 28:58.068
Just get out of their way!

29:00.172 --> 29:02.372
How do you turn this thing off?

29:08.748 --> 29:10.814
So he's gonna be okay?

29:10.816 --> 29:13.350
He keeps saying the
recliner's possessed.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.552
I really don't know
what's gotten into him.

29:16.822 --> 29:19.256
Maxi, there's
someone behind you.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.457
Hi, Ashanti.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.263
That's my grandad's
new girlfriend.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.500
So where's TJ staying?

29:29.502 --> 29:31.235
At his mum's.

29:31.237 --> 29:33.504
She just lives three
houses down the street.

29:47.520 --> 29:50.954
Mum!

29:50.956 --> 29:52.589
Mum!

29:52.591 --> 29:55.659
Mum!

30:58.924 --> 30:59.924
Mum!

31:04.396 --> 31:05.396
Mum!

31:26.485 --> 31:28.518
A dybbuk must feed on the souls

31:28.520 --> 31:30.487
of its victims to get stronger.

31:30.489 --> 31:33.423
Those who have come
across a dybbuk feeding

31:33.425 --> 31:38.495
speak of a lingering putrid
smell of burnt flesh in the air.

31:39.565 --> 31:40.497
They found burn marks

31:40.499 --> 31:41.499
on walls and on ceilings,

31:42.735 --> 31:45.469
pointing to extremely
powerful electrical currents

31:45.471 --> 31:47.905
produced in the transition

31:47.907 --> 31:51.909
of an unwilling soul
to a demonic dybbuk.

31:51.911 --> 31:56.647
Whatever you do, never
interrupt the feeding process.

31:56.649 --> 32:01.118
As the soul you are trying to
save has already been doomed.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.289
Close your eyes.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.228
Feel yourself going back.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.067
What do you see?

32:24.143 --> 32:25.876
The dybbuk!

32:32.518 --> 32:36.620
Use your senses!

32:36.622 --> 32:38.021
Use all of them!

32:39.992 --> 32:42.092
Focus, Jack, focus!

32:56.875 --> 32:57.875
Gerard!

33:46.625 --> 33:48.091
Jack!

33:50.963 --> 33:52.429
She poisoned someone.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.298
That's why they
were chasing her.

34:01.940 --> 34:03.740
But why did she kill herself?

34:04.843 --> 34:07.511
We need to find out
where that recliner is.

34:07.513 --> 34:09.346
Tomorrow morning
we'll call every

34:09.348 --> 34:12.215
delivery company in
the city if we have to.

34:12.217 --> 34:15.152
Whoever has that recliner
is in great danger.

34:43.549 --> 34:45.549
Who's there?

37:36.588 --> 37:38.021
Why didn't you go to TJ's?

37:38.023 --> 37:40.190
I rang the doorbell
and nobody answered.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.497
Please don't make me
go up there, Maxi.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.399
We'll just take a look, okay?

38:11.490 --> 38:13.256
Well, it's not moving now.

38:15.294 --> 38:16.526
Can we go to your place?

38:16.528 --> 38:18.061
I don't want to
stay here tonight.

38:43.889 --> 38:46.589
TJ, honey, I've got
to clean your room.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.545
Hey, Francesca.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.447
Oh, Ralph!

39:44.449 --> 39:46.349
I'm really sorry, I have to go.

39:46.351 --> 39:48.451
Have you thought
about what I asked?

39:52.023 --> 39:54.224
I told you, I can't
marry you, Ralph.

39:54.226 --> 39:55.592
I've got a boyfriend.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.560
Maxi told me about TJ.

39:57.562 --> 39:58.562
Horrible thing.

39:59.664 --> 40:02.766
He has weak bones,
I have strong bones.

40:03.802 --> 40:06.336
- We'd make strong babies.
- Babies?

40:06.338 --> 40:09.506
I'm too young for
babies, Ralph, I'm sorry.

40:10.876 --> 40:12.742
You've got to let
me in, Francesca.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.465
Hello, Maxi.

40:35.467 --> 40:37.500
It's Inspector Gravy speaking.

40:37.502 --> 40:40.904
Can you come down to the
police station, please?

40:40.906 --> 40:43.573
Francesca really
needs your help.

40:45.143 --> 40:49.212
Francesca, when TJ was
dying, he left a message.

40:53.418 --> 40:54.551
You know what I think?

40:55.654 --> 40:58.021
I think he left this
message for you.

40:59.391 --> 41:01.691
Do you think he was
trying to write Francesca?

41:02.828 --> 41:06.329
I think Frederico and
TJ's deaths are related.

41:11.036 --> 41:12.936
This list you gave us.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.206
You think one of them did this?

41:16.208 --> 41:17.340
Perhaps.

41:17.342 --> 41:19.442
- Who?
- You tell me.

41:20.745 --> 41:23.079
Who would you say,
hypothetically, of course,

41:23.081 --> 41:25.281
is capable of doing
something like this?

41:39.965 --> 41:42.599
Yep, my cousin Ralph.

41:44.903 --> 41:45.869
Remember that rubber glove

41:45.871 --> 41:48.204
they found at Frederico's place?

41:49.307 --> 41:51.641
- We've got a match.
- Warren Lee?

41:52.611 --> 41:55.044
- Criminal record.
- Yep.

41:55.046 --> 41:57.614
I think this could
be a two man job.

41:57.616 --> 42:00.750
Finally, things are
starting to make some sense.

44:31.836 --> 44:34.837
You're Francesca.

44:34.839 --> 44:37.173
You're Francesca!

44:37.175 --> 44:38.675
You're Francesca!

44:43.948 --> 44:45.081
Oh Francesca!

44:48.353 --> 44:49.686
Francesca!

44:53.725 --> 44:57.493
Did you deliver a
reclining chair to an address

44:57.495 --> 45:00.963
in the CBD within
the last few days?

45:00.965 --> 45:06.035
Well, they delivered a chair
to a girl named Francesca,

45:07.138 --> 45:08.404
but they wouldn't
give me her address.

45:08.406 --> 45:10.807
What's the name
of Maxi's friend?

45:10.809 --> 45:12.241
The girl who dances.

45:13.211 --> 45:16.079
- Patricia.
- Isn't it Francesca?

45:18.116 --> 45:22.351
- It's all too confusing.
- Who are you calling?

45:22.353 --> 45:23.419
Maxi.

45:27.325 --> 45:30.193
It's turned off,
I'll leave a message.

45:30.195 --> 45:35.264
Hey Maxi, come home, we
need to talk urgently.

45:36.401 --> 45:37.934
Maxi, this
really isn't necessary.

45:37.936 --> 45:39.435
I wanna go home.

45:39.437 --> 45:41.938
Trust me, you can't go home
until this thing is solved.

45:41.940 --> 45:44.507
There's a killer out there,
could be looking for you.

45:46.745 --> 45:47.745
Hey.

45:49.013 --> 45:51.180
I'll bring you your laptop
and your pajamas later.

45:52.717 --> 45:55.017
But for now you can use mine.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.320
Thank you.

45:57.322 --> 45:59.255
And if you need
anything, you can call me.

46:01.593 --> 46:03.192
I need to go meet my grandad.

46:06.397 --> 46:08.631
- I'll be back soon.
- Maxi.

46:09.701 --> 46:10.933
Do you mind just
passing through mine

46:10.935 --> 46:13.035
and seeing if the
recliner's okay?

46:13.037 --> 46:14.737
- What?
- Please.

46:17.075 --> 46:18.541
You're hurting me.

46:18.543 --> 46:20.777
I just need to know
that the recliner's okay.

46:22.013 --> 46:23.379
Are you okay?

46:26.684 --> 46:28.151
It's my sister's birthday.

46:29.354 --> 46:30.686
I should give her a call.

46:33.658 --> 46:37.093
Yeah, that's a great idea.

46:40.498 --> 46:43.766
So this is an authentic prop
sword from Death Slayer VI.

46:44.903 --> 46:46.702
You should go home
to your wife, Gravy.

46:47.939 --> 46:50.306
She left me two weeks ago.

46:51.543 --> 46:52.742
Took the kids with her.

46:54.979 --> 46:56.479
This time, it's for real.

46:59.350 --> 47:01.584
Gravy, the pressure cooker.

47:03.521 --> 47:05.588
You need to let some steam out.

47:09.260 --> 47:11.427
Do you wanna come
back to my place?

47:11.429 --> 47:15.364
We'll drink some wine,
we'll blow off some steam,

47:16.301 --> 47:18.100
- what do you reckon?
- No.

47:19.437 --> 47:22.138
Thanks, I think I should
stay here and do some work.

47:23.474 --> 47:24.474
Huh.

47:26.377 --> 47:27.377
There.

47:28.179 --> 47:29.579
Must be a popular model.

47:33.184 --> 47:36.352
You know that friend you're
always hanging out with?

47:36.354 --> 47:37.420
What's her name?

47:37.422 --> 47:39.422
- Who, Francesca?
- No.

47:39.424 --> 47:41.490
I told you it wasn't Patricia!

47:41.492 --> 47:42.725
Who's Patricia?

47:42.727 --> 47:45.194
I don't have time to
explain right now, Maxi.

47:45.196 --> 47:47.897
But your friend is
in great danger.

47:47.899 --> 47:51.534
That recliner she
bought is possessed.

47:53.371 --> 47:54.871
Maxi!

47:54.873 --> 47:56.505
I knew there was something
wrong with that recliner.

47:56.507 --> 47:58.341
She hasn't been herself
since she got it.

47:58.343 --> 47:59.876
Well, we need it.

47:59.878 --> 48:01.277
There's no time to lose.

48:01.279 --> 48:05.248
We've got to go get,
get, get it!

48:05.250 --> 48:07.416
Stay with him, Ashanti, I'll go.

48:07.418 --> 48:09.619
No, no, no, it's too dangerous.

50:56.621 --> 50:57.953
Who's there?

51:42.567 --> 51:43.567
Valerie.

51:52.510 --> 51:53.510
Valerie.

51:56.080 --> 51:57.080
Valerie.

52:00.785 --> 52:01.785
Valerie.

52:06.891 --> 52:08.424
Shit!

52:08.426 --> 52:09.959
Sorry, door was open, we just

52:09.961 --> 52:11.560
wanted to make
sure you were okay.

52:11.562 --> 52:12.394
You okay?

52:12.396 --> 52:13.729
No!

52:13.731 --> 52:15.231
I'm worried about Maxi.

52:15.233 --> 52:18.400
She left like two hours ago
and she's still not back.

52:19.504 --> 52:22.905
- I think I'm hearing things.
- Things?

52:22.907 --> 52:24.540
What kind of things?

52:26.077 --> 52:29.111
I thought I heard someone saying

52:29.113 --> 52:31.714
the name Valerie
out of the drain.

52:31.716 --> 52:34.049
How long have you
been taking these?

52:34.051 --> 52:36.218
I've been taking
those pills for years.

52:37.321 --> 52:39.955
You said before you
were worried about Maxi.

52:39.957 --> 52:43.826
Yes, she left like two hours
ago and she's still not back.

52:43.828 --> 52:45.361
Okay, okay, just settle down.

52:45.363 --> 52:47.930
We're gonna go there now
and make sure she's okay.

52:49.033 --> 52:51.433
You can even come
with us if you want.

52:59.076 --> 53:00.076
Maxi?

53:07.718 --> 53:09.552
Maybe she left already.

53:09.554 --> 53:10.986
And left her car outside?

53:22.967 --> 53:23.967
These are Maxi's keys.

53:25.203 --> 53:27.236
You tried calling her?

53:27.238 --> 53:28.270
Try again.

54:02.273 --> 54:03.706
Stinks here.

54:04.775 --> 54:06.175
Oh, God.

54:23.227 --> 54:24.893
Valerie, Valerie.

54:29.066 --> 54:30.066
Valerie.

54:44.215 --> 54:45.714
Valerie, Valerie.

55:03.601 --> 55:05.134
This is bad, Gravy.

56:06.263 --> 56:07.429
Francesca?

56:08.399 --> 56:10.399
This is Maxi's grandfather.

56:13.237 --> 56:14.703
We have to talk.

56:54.645 --> 56:56.578
What do you think
happened to Maxi?

56:57.948 --> 57:01.750
I don't know but she's
strong, she's very strong.

57:03.888 --> 57:06.855
So can you help me?

57:08.225 --> 57:09.425
I'll give it a try.

57:11.595 --> 57:13.529
Why am I seeing
these dead people?

57:14.932 --> 57:19.101
Sometimes fragments of
souls linger in this world.

57:19.103 --> 57:21.470
Perhaps they're trying
to tell you something

57:21.472 --> 57:22.938
or do something.

57:22.940 --> 57:26.809
And this voice I keep
hearing, it says "Valerie."

57:26.811 --> 57:28.777
But who's Valerie?

57:30.781 --> 57:31.781
Valerie.

57:32.716 --> 57:35.818
Valerie and Gerard, of course!

57:35.820 --> 57:38.687
Here it is, Valerie
and Gerard Collete.

57:38.689 --> 57:42.825
They were a french couple who
lived in Akaroa in the 1800s

57:42.827 --> 57:44.860
and they practiced witchcraft.

57:44.862 --> 57:48.530
Gerard and Valerie were
demonic soul eaters.

57:48.532 --> 57:53.402
They used the highly toxic
petals of nerium oleander

57:53.404 --> 57:55.337
to poison their victims.

57:55.339 --> 57:57.973
They were found out
and chased by a mob.

57:57.975 --> 58:00.409
Gerard was killed, burned alive,

58:00.411 --> 58:02.578
but Valerie committed
suicide in front

58:02.580 --> 58:07.249
of a peasant woman
named Marie St. Claire.

58:07.251 --> 58:10.586
That's my great
grandmother Marie!

58:10.588 --> 58:13.589
Marie suffered from
hallucinations.

58:13.591 --> 58:17.125
She claimed she had been
possessed by Valerie's spirit.

58:17.127 --> 58:19.194
After she became
the center of fights

58:19.196 --> 58:23.665
between men in the village, who
blindly fought for her love,

58:24.702 --> 58:26.902
on several occasions
to the death,

58:26.904 --> 58:29.404
she joined a monastery
and lived in isolation

58:29.406 --> 58:33.342
until she passed in 1876.

58:33.344 --> 58:36.445
Both Valerie and Gerard
had the power to ignite

58:36.447 --> 58:40.549
obsessive devotion from
whoever crossed their path.

58:40.551 --> 58:43.652
That's exactly
what happens to me!

58:43.654 --> 58:45.420
But that's because Valerie

58:45.422 --> 58:47.322
is living inside
of you, you see.

58:47.324 --> 58:50.392
Dybbuks can move from
generation to generation,

58:50.394 --> 58:53.762
especially within
the same family.

58:53.764 --> 58:57.733
She was fully awakened by
the presence of Gerard.

58:57.735 --> 59:00.168
They simply wanna
be together again.

59:00.170 --> 59:01.970
Gerard's in the recliner!

59:01.972 --> 59:05.173
Yeah, somehow a
portal was opened

59:05.175 --> 59:08.610
and Gerard inhabited
the recliner!

59:08.612 --> 59:10.646
It was Frederico!

59:10.648 --> 59:12.047
He was obsessed with the occult

59:12.049 --> 59:14.283
and the detective said
he was into voodoo.

59:17.054 --> 59:19.488
But something's
still not right here.

59:19.490 --> 59:24.293
You see, a dybbuk always
needs a human body to cling to

59:24.295 --> 59:27.462
and if Valerie is
clinging to you

59:29.133 --> 59:32.801
then Gerard would be
clinging to Frederico, but...

59:35.372 --> 59:38.106
Frederico was cut
into little pieces.

59:38.108 --> 59:39.174
He's dead.

59:40.277 --> 59:43.679
Yeah, it's a mystery all right.

59:43.681 --> 59:47.449
Okay, here's our plan.

59:47.451 --> 59:51.320
One, we build two dybbuk boxes.

59:52.356 --> 59:56.992
Two, we put the
dybbuks into the boxes.

59:59.129 --> 01:00:02.898
Three, we burn the boxes.

01:00:04.868 --> 01:00:06.368
It's gonna be a long night.

01:00:18.382 --> 01:00:19.382
Yeah.

01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:32.521
Stop thinking
about Frederico, okay?

01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:34.790
What happened to him...

01:01:58.482 --> 01:02:00.182
It was Frederico!

01:02:00.184 --> 01:02:02.818
He was obsessed with the occult!

01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:06.388
Valerie.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.560
Valer...

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:13.062
Valerie.

01:02:17.668 --> 01:02:18.668
Val...

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:40.555
Rabbi!

01:02:42.793 --> 01:02:45.594
What is it, Rabbi,
how can I help?

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.934
Okay, I'll call for help!

01:02:57.508 --> 01:02:58.774
Jack!

01:02:58.776 --> 01:03:00.575
It's an emergency,
I need an ambulance!

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:08.383
Why were you trying
to leave the country, Warren?

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:10.819
Look, I saw Frederico on
the news and I freaked out.

01:03:10.821 --> 01:03:11.820
Did you kill him?

01:03:11.822 --> 01:03:12.754
No, I didn't kill him.

01:03:12.756 --> 01:03:14.022
But you were at his house.

01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:15.257
Yes.

01:03:15.259 --> 01:03:16.491
What were you doing there?

01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:18.226
He asked me to cut his legs off.

01:03:31.408 --> 01:03:32.240
Why?

01:03:32.242 --> 01:03:33.441
I don't know why.

01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:35.343
I just thought, the
less I know, the better.

01:03:35.345 --> 01:03:36.745
But you're a
veterinarian, Warren.

01:03:36.747 --> 01:03:38.547
You're not even a surgeon.

01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:41.016
Look, I left him alive, yeah?

01:03:41.018 --> 01:03:42.684
It's not like I left
him bleeding out.

01:03:42.686 --> 01:03:45.353
I sutured him up and
I gave him some drugs.

01:03:46.723 --> 01:03:50.158
I figured the guy would
go to hospital eventually.

01:04:00.838 --> 01:04:01.838
Look.

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:05.807
I even got him to
sign a contract

01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:07.976
to say if anything happened I
wouldn't be held responsible.

01:04:07.978 --> 01:04:09.711
You think this means anything?

01:04:09.713 --> 01:04:11.413
I don't know, look,

01:04:11.415 --> 01:04:13.014
I know what I did was wrong,
but if it wasn't him...

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:15.150
Here's how it's gonna work.

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.720
You take us to where the body
is and we'll get you a deal.

01:04:18.722 --> 01:04:20.789
I already told you
I didn't kill him!

01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:22.324
And how do you even
know he's dead?

01:04:22.326 --> 01:04:23.725
Have you even found a body?

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:28.296
Well, here we are, detective.

01:04:28.298 --> 01:04:29.731
Ralph Kilkelly's apartment.

01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:34.236
Couldn't believe it when
I saw him on the news.

01:04:34.238 --> 01:04:35.238
Horrible thing.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:40.742
Yeah, he was an odd bloke,
not much for talking.

01:04:40.744 --> 01:04:42.944
Always paid his rent
though, never late.

01:04:44.348 --> 01:04:46.681
Hard to imagine such a thing
could happen in New Zealand.

01:04:50.787 --> 01:04:51.786
Why do you think he wanted you

01:04:51.788 --> 01:04:53.054
to cut his legs off, Warren?

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:54.890
Was there something
wrong with his legs?

01:04:54.892 --> 01:04:58.426
The guy was into
some weird stuff, man.

01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:01.496
I don't know.

01:05:01.498 --> 01:05:04.199
All he told me was
that it was urgent,

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:05.800
he didn't have much time,

01:05:05.802 --> 01:05:08.270
he was desperate to
get the legs off.

01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:11.273
Oh yeah, he installed the
CCTV cameras in our building.

01:05:12.843 --> 01:05:16.344
Worked at a store that
specialized in that sort of thing.

01:05:16.346 --> 01:05:18.380
This is Francesca
Morton's apartment.

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:26.588
It's being recorded.

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:28.523
He was one of
those guys, you know.

01:05:28.525 --> 01:05:30.725
He wasn't all there,
he was somewhere else.

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:32.961
You'd better give us
something soon, Warren.

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:43.905
Oh God, he was spying on her.

01:05:49.947 --> 01:05:51.846
What the hell is that?

01:05:58.755 --> 01:05:59.921
I'll be damned.

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:23.278
Get into the box.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.280
Right now!

01:06:31.722 --> 01:06:33.054
Get in the box.

01:06:40.964 --> 01:06:42.430
Please!

01:06:42.432 --> 01:06:45.633
Just into the box!

01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:46.635
No.

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:01.649
Die!

01:08:16.827 --> 01:08:17.692
You're not gonna believe me.

01:08:17.694 --> 01:08:18.694
Try me.

01:08:19.996 --> 01:08:22.863
I think he wanted
to be able to fit inside a...

01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:24.365
What, Warren?

01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:25.399
A recliner!

01:09:31.468 --> 01:09:35.270
Francesca, are you
all right in there?

01:09:40.477 --> 01:09:41.477
Francesca?

01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:51.787
Francesca?

01:09:54.558 --> 01:09:55.757
I'm coming in.

01:09:59.029 --> 01:10:02.197
No, thank you,
Inspector, I'm okay.

01:10:54.651 --> 01:10:55.651
Maxi!

01:10:59.789 --> 01:11:01.422
Where have you been?

01:11:02.525 --> 01:11:04.492
What happened here?

01:11:04.494 --> 01:11:07.395
Frederico was
inside the recliner.

01:11:07.397 --> 01:11:08.563
Are you okay?

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:12.500
It's over.

01:11:30.854 --> 01:11:33.621
So, you decided to
keep it after all.

01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:36.291
I need to stop
running, Inspector.

01:11:42.132 --> 01:11:44.465
I have to say, this
is a very unusual tea.

01:11:45.702 --> 01:11:50.071
It's nice but it has
a very unusual flavor.

01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:52.607
Would you like
some more, Inspector?

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:55.310
Yes, please.

01:12:18.401 --> 01:12:19.233
Yep.

01:12:19.235 --> 01:12:20.068
Inspector Gravy?

01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:21.569
Nope, Grape.

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:23.705
Just completed the
autopsy of Frederico Morton.

01:12:23.707 --> 01:12:25.807
Date of death on the
file's incorrect.

01:12:25.809 --> 01:12:27.141
What do you mean incorrect?

01:12:27.143 --> 01:12:29.610
It was two days
ago, I was there.

01:12:29.612 --> 01:12:30.845
The body I've got here's been

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:32.680
decomposing for at
least two weeks.

01:12:33.983 --> 01:12:35.616
You're absolutely sure?

01:12:35.618 --> 01:12:37.985
Yeah, this body's
been dead for weeks.

01:13:02.979 --> 01:13:05.680
It's not unusual for a dybbuk,

01:13:05.682 --> 01:13:07.382
after he's done with a human,

01:13:08.385 --> 01:13:11.719
to use the human
carcass to store souls.

01:13:12.589 --> 01:13:14.956
If the carcass becomes unusable

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:17.625
the souls will be transferred
to the nearest object

01:13:18.695 --> 01:13:21.629
until the perfect host
body can be found.

01:13:34.611 --> 01:13:36.511
Can I just say you're looking

01:13:36.513 --> 01:13:37.912
ravishing tonight, Francesca?

01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:39.080
Thank you, Inspector.

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:42.283
Please, call me Gravy.

01:13:42.285 --> 01:13:46.387
So, you didn't bring your
pistol this evening, did you?

01:13:47.424 --> 01:13:49.357
I would never bring
a gun to a date.

01:13:51.561 --> 01:13:52.927
Let it go, Gravy.

01:15:04.133 --> 01:15:06.701
Darling, look who came to visit.

01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:20.114
Come to me, my sweetheart.

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:34.962
Welcome home, my love.

01:16:10.567 --> 01:16:12.633
Emergency services.

01:16:12.635 --> 01:16:13.901
You want fire, ambulance or...

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:16.804
Ambulance, I need an
ambulance and police.

01:16:22.278 --> 01:16:26.747
Emergency services,
are you there?

01:16:26.749 --> 01:16:29.450
If you get fooled by
the dybbuk's apparent

01:16:29.452 --> 01:16:32.853
passive behavior, then
you've already lost.

01:16:34.023 --> 01:16:35.923
So choose your battles wisely,

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:39.894
as the demon is a
formidable adversary.

01:16:41.197 --> 01:16:44.165
And never ever underestimate

01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:47.668
the seducing power of the beast.

01:16:57.050 --> 01:17:05.050
