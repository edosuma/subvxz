WEBVTT

00:12.500 --> 00:14.167
LAST SEASON
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.200 --> 00:15.600
YOU HAVE TO GO. I'M LATE.
SERIOUSLY.

00:15.633 --> 00:18.333
GOOD-BYE... UM...

00:18.367 --> 00:20.033
DEREK.
YEAH.

00:21.300 --> 00:24.033
A MONTH AGO
YOU WERE IN MED SCHOOL

00:24.067 --> 00:27.433
BEING TAUGHT BY DOCTORS.
TODAY YOU ARE THE DOCTORS.

00:27.467 --> 00:29.200
YOU'RE INTERNS, GRUNTS,
NOBODIES,

00:29.233 --> 00:31.100
BOTTOM OF THE SURGICAL
FOOD CHAIN.

00:31.133 --> 00:33.667
IT'S LIKE CANDY, BUT WITH BLOOD,
WHICH IS SO MUCH BETTER.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.133
AND DR. SHEPHERD--
HE'S OVER THERE.

00:36.167 --> 00:39.167
WHO HERE FEELS LIKE THEY HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING?

00:39.200 --> 00:41.800
STOP LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT.
LIKE WHAT?

00:41.833 --> 00:43.700
LIKE YOU'VE SEEN ME NAKED.

00:43.733 --> 00:44.967
I DON'T GET PICKED FOR SURGERIES
'CAUSE I SLEPT WITH MY BOSS,

00:45.000 --> 00:48.100
AND I DIDN'T GET INTO MED SCHOOL
'CAUSE I HAVE A FAMOUS MOTHER.

00:48.133 --> 00:50.267
I USED TO BE A DOCTOR,
I THINK.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.367
FINE, GEORGE AND IZZIE,
YOU CAN MOVE INTO THE HOUSE.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.300
SO YOU BLEW ME OFF
FOR A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA.

00:55.333 --> 00:57.600
THAT'S NOT NEARLY AS MUCH FUN
TO WAKE UP TO.

00:57.633 --> 01:01.067
YOU MIND MOVING
THIS TAIL WAGON?

01:01.100 --> 01:03.600
THE NEXT TIME I SEE YOU FAVORING
MEREDITH GREY IN ANY WAY,

01:03.633 --> 01:06.700
I'LL MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T SEE
THE INSIDE OF AN O.R.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.733
FOR A MONTH.
YOU KNOW, I'M YOUR BOSS.

01:08.767 --> 01:11.300
YOU DON'T SCARE ME.
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT RICHARD
PROMISED CHIEF TO BOTH OF US.

01:11.333 --> 01:13.200
KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE
AND YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER.

01:13.233 --> 01:15.533
MORNING, DR. MODEL.
DR. EVIL SPAWN.

01:15.567 --> 01:18.700
YOU'RE NOT THE ENEMY.
YOU'RE JUST THE COMPETITION.

01:18.733 --> 01:21.433
WHAT IS THIS
THAT WE'RE DOING HERE?

01:21.467 --> 01:23.100
YOU NEED A DEFINITION?

01:28.200 --> 01:30.700
IT'S A TUMOR, AND IT'S PRESSING
AGAINST YOUR OPTIC NERVE.

01:30.733 --> 01:32.167
YOU'VE GOT SYPHILIS.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.233
(George) I DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS HAPPENED.

01:34.267 --> 01:36.167
YOU AND ALEX?

01:36.200 --> 01:37.800
YOU GAVE ME SYPHILIS?!

01:37.833 --> 01:40.100
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE WOULD
CALL THIS A RELATIONSHIP.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.267
WHO?
ME.

01:42.467 --> 01:44.767
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE FALLING FOR HIM.

01:44.800 --> 01:48.067
WHAT MAKES A HOTSHOT DOC
LEAVE THE BIG APPLE FOR SEATTLE?

01:48.100 --> 01:51.067
HI, I'M ADDISON SHEPHERD.
SHEPHERD?

01:51.100 --> 01:53.467
AND YOU MUST BE THE WOMAN
WHO'S BEEN SCREWING MY HUSBAND.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.200
(Meredith)
TO BE A GOOD SURGEON,

01:58.233 --> 02:00.133
YOU HAVE TO THINK
LIKE A SURGEON.

02:00.167 --> 02:02.067
EMOTIONS ARE MESSY.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.767
TUCK THEM NEATLY AWAY
AND STEP INTO A CLEAN,

02:04.800 --> 02:07.267
STERILE ROOM,

02:09.300 --> 02:12.300
CUT, SUTURE AND CLOSE.

02:12.333 --> 02:16.267
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.
YOU BEEN IN HERE BEFORE?

02:16.300 --> 02:18.700
ONCE.
THAT WORKED OUT REALLY WELL.

02:18.733 --> 02:21.533
I KNOW THAT LOOK. CAN ONLY
BE ONE OF TWO THINGS.

02:21.567 --> 02:23.100
EITHER YOUR BOSS
IS GIVING YOU HELL,

02:23.133 --> 02:25.400
OR YOUR BOYFRIEND IS.
WHICH IS IT?

02:25.433 --> 02:26.600
BOTH.

02:26.633 --> 02:30.733
BUT SOMETIMES YOU'RE FACED
WITH A CUT THAT WON'T HEAL...

02:30.767 --> 02:33.067
MY BOYFRIEND IS MY BOSS,

02:33.067 --> 02:35.167
WHICH WAS A PROBLEM.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.100
BUT NOT AS BIG A PROBLEM

02:37.133 --> 02:39.700
AS THE FACT THAT MY BOYFRIEND
HAS A WIFE.

02:39.733 --> 02:42.100
TELL YOU WHAT--
THIS ONE IS ON THE HOUSE.

02:42.133 --> 02:44.533
A CUT THAT RIPS ITS STITCHES

02:44.567 --> 02:46.067
WIDE OPEN.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.433
ADDISON, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

02:47.467 --> 02:48.800
YOUR HAIR'S DIFFERENT.

02:48.833 --> 02:50.733
A LOT OF THINGS
ARE DIFFERENT.

02:50.767 --> 02:52.667
IT'S LONGER. I LIKE IT.
IT'S VERY RUSSELL CROWE.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:54.633 --> 02:56.267
YOU JUST PICK UP
AND LEAVE EVERYTHING--

02:56.300 --> 02:58.200
YOUR HOUSE, YOUR PRACTICE,
YOUR FRIENDS?

02:58.233 --> 03:00.067
YOU HAD A LIFE IN MANHATTAN.
HAD.

03:00.100 --> 03:02.667
AND NOW YOU HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND IN SEATTLE.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.733
SHE SEEMS... SWEET.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.067
THE ICE YOU'RE ON--THIN.

03:07.100 --> 03:08.833
SHE'S YOUNG.
THAT WHOLE WIDE-EYED,

03:08.867 --> 03:11.067
"OOH, HE'S A BRAIN SURGEON"
THING HAPPENING,

03:11.100 --> 03:12.833
BUT STILL SWEET, WHICH IS WHAT
YOU WERE GOING FOR, RIGHT?

03:12.867 --> 03:14.367
THE ANTI-ADDISON?

03:14.400 --> 03:16.300
IF YOU CAME OUT HERE
TO TRY TO WIN ME BACK,

03:16.333 --> 03:17.500
YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT IT.

03:17.533 --> 03:19.433
I DID. I FLEW ALL THE WAY
ACROSS THE COUNTRY

03:19.467 --> 03:21.367
TO REMINISCE OVER
WEDDING PHOTOS, GET DRUNK,

03:21.400 --> 03:23.700
FALL INTO BED, MAKE YOU REALIZE
YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT ME.

03:23.733 --> 03:26.167
RELAX, DEREK.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.533
I'M HERE FOR WORK.

03:27.567 --> 03:29.700
I'M HELMING THE T.T.T.S. CASE
YOU GUYS ADMITTED LAST WEEK.

03:29.733 --> 03:31.633
AND FROM RICHARD'S BRIEFING,
I SHOULD BE--

03:31.667 --> 03:33.567
RICHARD KNEW
YOU WERE COMING OUT HERE?

03:33.600 --> 03:35.700
HE ASKED ME TO COME.
DIDN'T HE TELL YOU?
NO, HE DIDN'T.

03:35.733 --> 03:38.333
HMM. WELL, SURPRISE.

03:38.367 --> 03:40.100
THE HAIR, THOUGH...

03:40.133 --> 03:42.833
YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS HAD
A THING FOR RUSSELL CROWE.

03:42.867 --> 03:45.767
***

03:47.400 --> 03:49.400
LET ME SEE IT.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.167
NO LACERATIONS,
NORMAL SWELLING.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.533
GEORGE REALLY
KNOCKED YOU AROUND.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.400
THE GUY'S A LIGHTWEIGHT.

03:55.433 --> 03:57.333
I COULDA PINNED HIM
IN A SECOND IF I WANTED.

03:57.367 --> 03:58.700
YEAH, SO WHY DIDN'T YOU?

03:58.733 --> 04:00.233
ARE YOU KIDDING?

04:00.267 --> 04:02.567
I'M RIDING A CAREER IN PLASTICS
ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.500
I CAN'T AFFORD
TO INJURE THESE BABIES.

04:04.533 --> 04:06.467
ESPECIALLY OVER SOMEONE
LIKE O'MALLEY.
YOU HAD IT COMING.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.400
THE DUDE PUNCHES
LIKE MY SISTER.

04:08.433 --> 04:12.267
OH, SO BY YOUR DEFINITION, THEN,
YOU GOT BEAT UP BY A GIRL?

04:12.300 --> 04:13.700
(chuckles)

04:15.267 --> 04:16.600
ALL HAIL THE CHAMP!

04:16.633 --> 04:17.700
(cheering)

04:17.733 --> 04:19.733
SO MY GUY ALEX FINALLY GOT
WHAT WAS COMIN' TO HIM?

04:19.767 --> 04:21.667
GEORGE KNOCKED HIM DOWN
IN ONE PUNCH.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.200
YOU SHOULDA SEEN IT.

04:23.233 --> 04:24.567
I DON'T WANNA TALK
ABOUT IT.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.267
BRAG, CHAMP, BRAG.
YOU'VE EARNED IT.
CAN I HAVE A BEER?

04:27.300 --> 04:30.400
LET'S PLAY A GAME OF
WHOSE LIFE SUCKS THE MOST.

04:30.433 --> 04:31.767
LET'S NOT.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.067
I'LL WIN.
I ALWAYS WIN.

04:34.067 --> 04:35.800
WELL, YOU DON'T WANNA PLAY
WITH ME.

04:35.833 --> 04:39.067
OH, I DO.
I'LL EVEN GO FIRST.

04:39.067 --> 04:40.433
DEREK'S MARRIED.

04:42.400 --> 04:47.333
GEORGE, BEER IS DRIPPING
FROM YOUR NOSTRILS.

04:47.367 --> 04:50.067
TOLD YOU I'D WIN.

04:50.100 --> 04:52.467
NO, YOU DON'T WIN.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.767
DID YOU HEAR ME?

04:53.800 --> 04:55.667
I SAID DEREK IS MARRIED.

04:55.700 --> 04:59.767
AS IN PIGHEADED,
ADULTEROUS, LIAR MARRIED.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.700
NOTHING YOU COULD SAY
COULD TOP THAT.

05:01.733 --> 05:03.767
I'M PREGNANT.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.833
I WIN.

05:05.867 --> 05:07.367
(Man) JOE, YOU ALL RIGHT?

05:07.400 --> 05:09.433
(dishes crash on floor)

05:10.500 --> 05:12.133
OKAY, MAYBE JOE WINS.

05:12.167 --> 05:15.067
***

05:22.633 --> 05:24.233
(George) JOE, LIE DOWN.
THE MEDICS ARE ON THE WAY.

05:24.267 --> 05:26.367
YOU CALLED
THE GURNEY PATROL?
SIT BACK AND RELAX.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.600
WE HAVE TO TAKE YOU TO
THE HOSPITAL TO RUN SOME TESTS.

05:28.633 --> 05:30.767
TESTS? NO. I DON'T NEED
ANY TESTS. I'M FINE.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.367
DUDE, YOU COLLAPSED
ON THE FLOOR.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.500
THIS IS YOUR BAR. YOU KNOW
HOW FILTHY THIS FLOOR IS.

05:34.533 --> 05:36.633
RADIAL PULSE IS STRONG.
MINOR SKULL CONTUSION.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.767
YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH SOMEONE?
WHAT? WHO?

05:38.800 --> 05:40.700
WHY IS THAT SUCH A SHOCK?
EVEN GEORGE MANAGED

05:40.733 --> 05:43.267
TO GET SOME ACTION.
CORRECTION.
GEORGE GOT SOME SYPHILIS.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.767
HOW COULD I NOT KNOW
YOU WERE SLEEPING WITH SOMEONE?

05:45.800 --> 05:47.700
FORGET THIS. THE HOSPITAL
IS RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.

05:47.733 --> 05:49.633
I CAN SURE AS HELL WALK
ACROSS THE STREET BY MYSELF.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.600
OH, I THINK WE SHOULD--

05:51.633 --> 05:53.300
NO, I GOT IT. JOE!

05:53.333 --> 05:56.167
(thunder rumbles)

05:56.200 --> 05:58.300
ALL RIGHT, DETAILS.

05:58.333 --> 06:01.100
YOU'RE PREGNANT?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

06:01.133 --> 06:03.767
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WITH PREGNANT INTERNS.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.067
I'M NOT SWITCHING
TO THE VAGINA SQUAD

06:06.100 --> 06:07.833
OR SPENDING MY LIFE
POPPING ZITS.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.533
I'M TOO TALENTED.

06:09.567 --> 06:11.067
SURGERY'S MY LIFE.

06:11.100 --> 06:13.100
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION,
WHO ARE YOU SLEEPING WITH?

06:13.133 --> 06:15.267
JUST A GUY.
THAT'S ALL I GET?

06:15.300 --> 06:17.200
YOU CAN'T JUST BRING
SOMETHING LIKE THIS UP

06:17.233 --> 06:20.167
AND EXPECT ME TO DROP IT.
WATCH ME.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.600
(Isobel)
WHY ARE YOU BACK HERE TONIGHT?

06:21.633 --> 06:23.433
DON'T YOU HAVE
A DATE WITH McDREAMY?

06:23.467 --> 06:25.200
MORE LIKE McMARRIED.

06:25.233 --> 06:26.767
McWHAT?
I CAME TO CHECK ON JOE.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.700
DO YOU THINK
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY?

06:28.733 --> 06:30.600
YOU THINK HE'S GONNA NEED
AN OPERATION?

06:30.633 --> 06:32.500
OPERATION--YES.
OKAY--HARD TO TELL.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.800
THE BASILAR ARTERY IS BLOWN UP
LIKE A BALLOON,

06:34.833 --> 06:36.500
SUBARACHNOID BLEEDING

06:36.533 --> 06:38.467
AND AN ANEURYSM THE SIZE
OF A GOLF BALL.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.167
NO WAY TO CLIP
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
NOT WITHOUT MAGIC FINGERS.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.700
OR A STANDSTILL OPERATION.

06:42.733 --> 06:44.233
YOU'RE DOING
THE STANDSTILL OPERA--

06:44.267 --> 06:46.167
HE'S DOING
THE STANDSTILL OPERATION.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.833
I'D LIKE TO TRY.

06:47.867 --> 06:49.733
BUT FIRST I NEED SOME
ADDITIONAL PATIENT HISTORY,

06:49.767 --> 06:52.333
OVERNIGHT LABS
AND A CEREBRAL ANGIO.

06:52.367 --> 06:54.067
I'M DRUNK.

06:54.067 --> 06:55.800
MEREDITH...

07:00.100 --> 07:02.400
(softly) McBASTARD.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.267
AHEM.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.767
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:11.800 --> 07:13.700
UH, I AM ON HER SIDE,

07:13.733 --> 07:16.200
BUT WE'RE TALKING
A POSSIBLE STANDSTILL HERE.

07:16.233 --> 07:21.667
RECOGNIZE.

07:21.700 --> 07:22.633
MEREDITH.

07:22.667 --> 07:24.067
GO AWAY.

07:24.067 --> 07:25.100
JUST WAIT.
WE SHOULD DISCUSS THIS.

07:25.133 --> 07:26.467
HERE'S A THOUGHT.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.833
NO. QUIT FOLLOWING ME.

07:27.867 --> 07:29.367
AT LEAST LET ME EXPLAIN.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.367
EXPLAIN? YOU KNOW WHEN YOU
SHOULD'VE EXPLAINED?

07:32.400 --> 07:34.067
THE NIGHT WE MET
IN THE BAR,

07:34.067 --> 07:35.767
BEFORE ANY OF THE REST OF IT.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.700
YEAH, THAT WOULD'VE BEEN
A GOOD TIME TO DISCUSS THIS.

07:37.733 --> 07:40.100
LOOK, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
DO YOU?

07:40.133 --> 07:41.300
SOMEHOW I DOUBT THAT.

07:41.333 --> 07:43.233
BECAUSE IF YOU DID,
YOU WOULD SHUT UP

07:43.267 --> 07:46.200
AND YOU WOULD TURN AROUND
AND GO BACK INSIDE,

07:46.233 --> 07:48.600
BECAUSE YOU WOULD REALIZE
THAT I AM THIS CLOSE

07:48.633 --> 07:50.533
TO GETTING IN MY CAR
AND RUNNING YOU DOWN

07:50.567 --> 07:53.733
IN THE PARKING LOT!

07:53.767 --> 07:55.833
GIVE ME THE KEYS.

07:55.867 --> 07:57.500
(Meredith) I'M FINE.

07:57.533 --> 07:58.633
GIVE ME THE KEYS.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.167
LET'S GO, OKAY?

08:00.200 --> 08:03.100
***

08:04.567 --> 08:07.433
AND THE HUSBAND
WAS THE WORST. (laughs)

08:07.467 --> 08:09.167
(laughs)

08:13.200 --> 08:15.433
HMM.

08:15.467 --> 08:19.533
AHEM. WELL, I WILL BE BACK
IN THE MORNING

08:19.567 --> 08:21.067
TO REPORT FOR DUTY.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.567
AND YOU...
(makes kissing sound)

08:23.600 --> 08:25.333
GET SOME REST.

08:29.767 --> 08:31.200
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

08:31.233 --> 08:34.567
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
SHE'S THE BEST IN THE FIELD.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.067
BRINGING ADDIE OUT
WAS A BUSINESS DECISION,

08:37.100 --> 08:38.433
NOTHING PERSONAL.

08:38.467 --> 08:42.667
OH, WELL. WHAT A RELIEF.
IT'S NOT PERSONAL.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.167
IT IS PERSONAL TO ME.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.467
THE WORKINGS OF MY SURGICAL UNIT
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING--

08:46.500 --> 08:49.567
DON'T INCLUDE MY WIFE!
DON'T INCLUDE
YOUR PRIVATE LIFE.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.100
BURKE WILL ACT
AS CHIEF OF SURGERY

08:57.133 --> 08:59.067
UNTIL I'M BACK ON MY FEET.

08:59.067 --> 09:00.433
YOU GAVE CHIEF TO BURKE?

09:00.467 --> 09:02.767
LIKE I SAID, THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR PERSONAL IN BEING CHIEF.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.667
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

09:04.700 --> 09:07.567
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SLEEPING
WITH AN INTERN?

09:09.733 --> 09:12.500
SO I GUESS PART OF BEING CHIEF
IS PERSONAL.

09:12.533 --> 09:16.600
CLOSE THE DOOR
ON YOUR WAY OUT.

09:20.867 --> 09:23.767
***

09:30.700 --> 09:32.500
ALLIS.

09:34.867 --> 09:38.667
BABCOCK.

09:38.700 --> 09:40.333
RIGHT ANGLE CLAMP.

09:40.367 --> 09:41.667
OH.

09:41.700 --> 09:44.167
I'M GONNA STERILIZE EVERYTHING
WHEN I'M DONE.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.500
THE SCRUB NURSES WON'T
EVEN KNOW I WAS HERE.

09:46.533 --> 09:48.467
MY LIPS ARE SEALED.

09:53.567 --> 09:56.667
SO, UM,
I HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK.

09:56.700 --> 09:58.367
I CHECKED THE SCHEDULE,

09:58.400 --> 10:01.367
AND I NOTICED THAT YOU AND I
ARE BOTH OFF TONIGHT.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.267
I MADE RESERVATIONS.

10:03.300 --> 10:07.567
I HAVE
A FAVORITE RESTAURANT.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.033
NONE OF THOSE
WERE QUESTIONS.

10:11.867 --> 10:15.000
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
OUT TO DINNER WITH ME TONIGHT?

10:21.400 --> 10:23.533
YOU KNOW,
THE O.R. IS THE ONE PLACE

10:23.567 --> 10:27.533
WHERE I CAN COME AND THINK...

10:27.567 --> 10:30.500
AND I WAS THINKING RIGHT NOW,
OKAY?

10:30.533 --> 10:32.367
OF COURSE.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.633
I GET IT.

10:40.833 --> 10:42.733
(George)
I'M NOT A VIOLENT PERSON.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.267
I'M A PACIFIST,

10:44.300 --> 10:48.233
BUT, YOU KNOW, HE JUST--
HE KEPT PUSHING AND PUSH--

10:48.267 --> 10:50.167
HE PUSHED ME,
AND I PUSHED BACK.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.367
I WAS PUSHED,
YOU KNOW, AND NOW HE--

10:52.400 --> 10:53.733
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:53.767 --> 10:56.100
ALEX TRIES
TO LAY A HAND ON YOU,

10:56.133 --> 10:58.300
JUST TELL ME.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

10:58.333 --> 11:00.633
I DON'T NEED YOU TO--
TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

11:00.667 --> 11:03.367
IF ALEX STARTS SOMETHING,
I-I'LL HANDLE IT MYSELF.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.733
I CAN HANDLE IT.

11:04.767 --> 11:06.767
OKAY, PEOPLE, ASSIGNMENTS.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.733
YANG,
YOU'RE ON DISCHARGES.

11:08.767 --> 11:10.467
O'MALLEY,
REPORT TO ROOM E19.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.367
GREY, COME SEE ME,

11:12.400 --> 11:14.500
AND WHO WAS ON CALL
LAST NIGHT?

11:14.533 --> 11:15.700
SLOPPY, SLOPPY, SLOPPY.

11:15.733 --> 11:18.767
REDO THESE AND RETURN THEM TO ME
BEFORE LUNCH, UNDERSTOOD?

11:18.800 --> 11:19.733
UNDERSTOOD.

11:19.767 --> 11:21.267
KAREV, DON'T TEMPT ME.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.633
SOMEBODY'S POPULAR.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.167
MEANING?

11:24.200 --> 11:26.733
THERE'S BEEN A SPECIAL REQUEST
JUST FOR YOU.

11:26.767 --> 11:28.667
THE CHIEF RUNS THROUGH
ALL OF THIS?

11:28.700 --> 11:30.067
BEFORE LUNCH.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.833
AFTER, YOU'VE GOT
CALLS TO RETURN,

11:31.867 --> 11:34.300
A BUDGET TO APPROVE,
TWO STAFF MEETINGS,

11:34.333 --> 11:36.633
AND FOUR OF RICHARD'S SURGERIES,
INCLUDING YOUR OWN.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.167
ABSOLUTELY. NO PROBLEM.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.400
VIRGINS...

11:39.433 --> 11:41.100
SO CONGRATULATIONS
ARE IN ORDER.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.633
DON'T SWEAT IT,
SHEPHERD.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.633
I'LL ONLY BE YOUR BOSS
FOR A FEW DAYS.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.567
I'M WELL AWARE
OF RICHARD'S RECOVERY TIME.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.500
I'M THE ONE WHO
OPERATED ON HIM, REMEMBER?

11:48.533 --> 11:49.667
I DO.
YOU OPERATED, HE SURVIVED

11:49.700 --> 11:52.100
AND CHOSE ME TO TAKE OVER
WHILE RECRUITING YOUR WIFE.

11:52.133 --> 11:53.433
CLEARLY,
HE HAS BRAIN DAMAGE.

11:53.467 --> 11:55.700
OR IS IT YOUR EX-WIFE?
I'M A LITTLE FUZZY ON THAT.

11:55.733 --> 11:57.500
AHH, WE'RE SEPARATED.

11:57.533 --> 11:59.433
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
DR. BURKE.

11:59.467 --> 12:00.800
YOU'RE NEVER INTERRUPTING.

12:00.833 --> 12:02.067
SHE'S ALWAYS INTERRUPTING.

12:02.067 --> 12:04.167
I WAS JUST CHECKING TO SEE
IF DR. BURKE SECURED THE IN--

12:04.200 --> 12:07.400
INTERN YOU REQUESTED.
HE DID.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.600
DEFINE T.T.T.S.

12:23.633 --> 12:26.067
TWIN-TWIN TRANSFUSION SYNDROME--
CONJOINED FETAL TWINS.

12:26.067 --> 12:28.300
CONNECTED BY?

12:28.333 --> 12:30.467
BLOOD VESSELS
IN THE PLACENTA.
MEANING?

12:30.500 --> 12:32.600
ONE TWIN GETS TOO MUCH BLOOD,
THE OTHER TOO LITTLE,

12:32.633 --> 12:34.500
ENDANGERING THE LIVES
OF BOTH.

12:34.533 --> 12:36.133
I'D EXPECT YOU
TO KNOW THAT, GREY.

12:36.167 --> 12:37.533
YOU TOLD ME
THERE WASN'T MUCH CHANCE

12:37.567 --> 12:39.133
THAT ANYTHING COULD BE DONE,
BUT--

12:39.167 --> 12:41.633
T.T.T.S. IS USUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE TO CORRECT,

12:41.667 --> 12:43.533
UNLESS YOU HAPPEN TO BE
ONE OF THE HANDFUL OF SURGEONS

12:43.567 --> 12:45.733
IN THE WORLD WHO KNOWS HOW
TO SEPARATE FETAL BLOOD VESSELS,

12:45.767 --> 12:48.700
WHICH, LUCKILY FOR YOU,
I AM.

12:48.733 --> 12:50.533
SO WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
INTO SURGERY TOMORROW.

12:50.567 --> 12:53.200
IF YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS AT ALL,

12:53.233 --> 12:54.400
PLEASE ASK DR. GREY.

12:54.433 --> 12:56.100
FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN,

12:56.133 --> 12:59.267
SHE IS ONE OF THE HOSPITAL'S
MOST POPULAR INTERNS.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.100
I COULD'VE
ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION

13:01.133 --> 13:03.133
HAD YOU
GIVEN ME THE CHANCE.

13:03.167 --> 13:05.067
CHIN UP, GREY.
I'M THIS TOUGH ON EVERYONE,

13:05.100 --> 13:07.300
NOT JUST THE WOMEN
MY HUSBAND SLEEPS WITH.

13:07.333 --> 13:09.067
ORDER AN ULTRASOUND...

13:09.100 --> 13:11.533
HI. CAN I HAVE THE CHART
FOR 119, PLEASE?

13:11.567 --> 13:13.500
THANK YOU.

13:19.300 --> 13:21.433
OH, GOOD. YOU'RE HERE.
LET'S GET STARTED.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.833
OKAY.

13:22.867 --> 13:24.167
(grunts)

13:26.167 --> 13:27.100
O'MALLEY.
YEAH.

13:27.133 --> 13:28.767
YOU'RE TOUCHING ME.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.100
WELL, YEAH.

13:30.133 --> 13:31.767
NO.

13:31.800 --> 13:32.700
CARMEN...

13:35.533 --> 13:38.633
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME
VERY CAREFULLY.

13:38.667 --> 13:41.100
AS LONG AS I'M IN HERE,

13:41.133 --> 13:43.167
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE

13:43.200 --> 13:46.267
WITH MY DOCTORS,
MY PATIENTS, MY HOSPITAL.

13:46.300 --> 13:49.067
YOU ARE MY EYES TODAY,
MY EARS.

13:49.067 --> 13:51.333
I WANT YOU TO BE A SPONGE.

13:51.367 --> 13:53.600
A SPONGE?
YOU REPORT
ANY AND EVERYTHING

13:53.633 --> 13:55.700
HAPPENING IN THIS HOSPITAL
TO ME.

13:55.733 --> 13:57.067
I'M AN INVESTIGATIVE SPONGE.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.533
I'M NOT FOOLIN' AROUND,
O'MALLEY.

13:58.567 --> 14:01.700
THERE'S TOO MUCH BEEN HAPPENIN'
LATELY UNDER MY RADAR.

14:01.733 --> 14:04.333
IT STOPS TODAY.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.500
UH, BURKE,
YOU GAVE GREY TO ADDISON?

14:22.533 --> 14:23.667
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

14:23.700 --> 14:25.433
THAT'S NOT YOUR CALL,
SHEPHERD.

14:25.467 --> 14:28.533
AND FOR THE RECORD,
I'M ALWAYS SURE.

14:28.567 --> 14:31.233
DID YOU NEED ME FOR SOMETHING?
BECAUSE AS THE NEW CHIEF, I'M--

14:31.267 --> 14:32.300
INTERIM CHIEF.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.100
CHIEF NONETHELESS.

14:34.133 --> 14:36.067
EVER ATTEMPT
A STANDSTILL SURGERY?

14:36.100 --> 14:37.300
IT'S THE LOCATION

14:37.333 --> 14:39.233
OF THE ANEURYSM
THAT MAKES IT TRICKY.

14:39.267 --> 14:41.433
YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WILL
BE LOWERED COOL ENOUGH

14:41.467 --> 14:43.567
TO PROTECT YOU FROM ANY DAMAGE
AND STOP THE HEART.

14:43.600 --> 14:44.667
WHICH STOPS THE BLOOD FLOW
TO THE BRAIN,

14:44.700 --> 14:46.467
WHICH REDUCES THE RISK
OF RUPTURE.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.700
I'LL HAVE 45 MINUTES
TO CLIP THE ANEURYSM--

14:48.733 --> 14:51.333
BEFORE I STEP IN AND GET
THE HEART STARTED AGAIN.

14:51.367 --> 14:52.533
YOU WANNA FREEZE MY BODY,

14:52.567 --> 14:54.267
DRAIN MY BLOOD
AND STOP MY HEART?

14:54.300 --> 14:56.200
AND BRING YOU BACK.
IN UNDER 45 MINUTES.

14:56.233 --> 14:58.067
IF YOU GO OVER,
IS IT FREE?

14:58.067 --> 14:59.067
NO.

14:59.100 --> 15:04.400
DR. YANG, YOU CAN GO
AND HANDLE THE PRE-OP LABS.

15:04.433 --> 15:05.700
HOW MUCH?

15:05.733 --> 15:08.267
HOW MUCH DOES SOMETHING
LIKE THIS COST?

15:08.300 --> 15:10.533
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD WORRY
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

15:10.567 --> 15:14.267
HEY, LOOK, YOU GUYS SAY THAT YOU
CAN KILL ME AND BRING ME BACK.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.400
I BELIEVE YOU. YOU'RE DOCTORS.
BUT I OWN A BAR.

15:16.433 --> 15:19.067
I DON'T GOT ANY INSURANCE,
SO I'M NOT THAT CONCERNED

15:19.067 --> 15:21.667
ABOUT THE SURGERY SO MUCH
AS WHAT I'M GONNA DO

15:21.700 --> 15:23.600
WHEN I SURVIVE IT.

15:23.633 --> 15:27.067
I NEED A NUMBER.
10 GRAND? 20?

15:27.067 --> 15:28.800
30?

15:28.833 --> 15:30.467
IT'S A COUPLE HUNDRED
AT LEAST.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.633
AT LEAST.

15:35.733 --> 15:38.067
WHO'S HALLORAN?

15:38.067 --> 15:40.133
PATIENT IN 4115.

15:40.167 --> 15:43.167
RED HAIR?
WIFE KNITS ALL THE TIME?

15:43.200 --> 15:44.833
HE HAD THE COLECTOMY?

15:44.867 --> 15:47.533
OH, COLON DUDE, THAT'S RIGHT.
WHO'S MONTEROSSO?

15:47.567 --> 15:49.700
4238. THE MOM WITH
THE REALLY CUTE KIDS.

15:49.733 --> 15:51.667
SHE SPIKED A POST-OP FEVER
LAST NIGHT.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.433
YOU SPENT TWO HOURS
MONITORING HER.
HERNIA CHICK, THAT'S RIGHT.

15:54.467 --> 15:56.367
YOU HAVE BEEN TREATING
THESE PEOPLE FOR THE LAST WEEK.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.633
HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW
THEIR NAMES?
SURGERY'S THE ONLY SPECIALTY

15:58.667 --> 16:00.467
WHERE WE DON'T WASTE TIME
GETTING TO KNOW THE PATIENTS.

16:00.500 --> 16:03.167
THEY'RE SLABS OF MEAT,
AND WE'RE BUTCHERS.
THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.333
YOU DO KNOW WHAT A HUMAN BEING
IS, DON'T YOU, EVIL SPAWN?

16:05.367 --> 16:08.067
I'M NOT EVIL.
UNLESS EVIL TURNS YOU ON.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.067
DO YOU EVER WAKE UP
IN THE MORNING AND REALIZE

16:10.067 --> 16:13.500
NOBODY LIKES YOU
AND, I DON'T KNOW, CARE?

16:13.533 --> 16:16.733
OH.
I THINK SOMEBODY LIKES ME.

16:22.433 --> 16:23.600
HEY.

16:23.633 --> 16:27.067
WHAT, YOU DON'T SPEAK NOW THAT
YOU'RE CHIEF? HEY, BURKE!

16:27.100 --> 16:28.200
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:28.233 --> 16:30.067
WHAT?

16:30.067 --> 16:31.067
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:31.067 --> 16:32.600
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO OUT
TO DINNER.

16:32.633 --> 16:34.267
YOU DON'T WANT TO MEET ME
IN THE ON CALL ROOM,

16:34.300 --> 16:36.200
AND YOU SURE AS HELL
DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ME.

16:36.233 --> 16:37.667
I COULD PRETEND I KNOW,

16:37.700 --> 16:39.633
BUT, HEY, I DON'T EVEN HAVE
YOUR HOME PHONE NUMBER.

16:39.667 --> 16:43.433
SO TELL ME,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?!
DON'T YELL AT ME.

16:43.467 --> 16:46.500
HEY, WE'RE HAVING
A CONVERSATION HERE.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:46.533 --> 16:48.567
I DON'T KNOW!

16:53.633 --> 16:56.633
FIGURE IT OUT.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.600
WHAT'S THE REPORT?

17:15.633 --> 17:18.833
NO REPORT.
IT'S VERY QUIET TODAY, SIR.

17:18.867 --> 17:21.333
THERE'S NO NEWS, GOSSIP,
SURGERIES I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

17:21.367 --> 17:22.567
COME ON, WHAT'S THE BUZZ,
O'MALLEY?

17:22.600 --> 17:26.333
YOU KNOW, NOT IN THE HALLS
OR NOT IN THE O.R.,

17:26.367 --> 17:27.333
NOT IN THE STAIRWELLS.

17:27.367 --> 17:30.167
ESPECIALLY, YOU KNOW,
NOTHING HAPPENING IN THE--

17:30.200 --> 17:32.367
THEY'RE JUST STAIRWELLS.

17:37.633 --> 17:39.233
(wolf whistles)

17:39.267 --> 17:41.467
THEY TOLD ME
YOU WERE IN A NIGHTGOWN,

17:41.500 --> 17:43.067
BUT I THOUGHT I'D COME
AND SEE IT FOR MYSELF.

17:43.067 --> 17:44.600
VERY NICE. HUH?

17:44.633 --> 17:47.233
HEARD O'MALLEY LAID YOU
OUT COLD. NICE EYE.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.533
WHOA, WHO SENT THAT?

17:48.567 --> 17:50.500
WE ALL PITCHED IN.
THE WHOLE FLOOR.

17:50.533 --> 17:53.300
WELL, PLEASE TELL
THE WHOLE FLOOR A BIG THANK YOU.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.567
YEAH, I WILL.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.500
ALEX, YOU GOTTA GET ME
OUT OF HERE, MAN.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.833
GET ME TRANSFERRED TO
COUNTY HOSPITAL OR SOMETHING.

17:58.867 --> 18:00.600
OH, YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO TO COUNTY.

18:00.633 --> 18:03.067
I MEAN, HERE THEY KNOW HOW
TO KILL YOU AND BRING YOU BACK.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.833
BUT AT COUNTY, THEY JUST KNOW
HOW TO KILL YOU. NO JOKE.

18:04.867 --> 18:07.467
I CAN'T AFFORD THIS PLACE, MAN.
I'M GONNA LOSE THE BAR.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.300
(Man)
HEY, JOE, HOW YOU DOING?

18:09.333 --> 18:10.800
HEY, SCOOTER.

18:10.833 --> 18:13.300
OKAY. THAT'S MINE.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.233
WELL, FIRST THINGS FIRST.
WE'RE GONNA START BY TRYING

18:15.267 --> 18:17.200
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE, MAN.
THE BAR IS MY LIFE.

18:17.233 --> 18:19.133
YOU KNOW THAT. YOU'VE BEEN
AT LAST CALL WITH ME

18:19.167 --> 18:21.067
PRACTICALLY EVERY NIGHT
SINCE YOU MOVED HERE.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.300
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SHUT IT DOWN
OR SELL IT.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.667
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
THE PLACE IS AN INSTITUTION.

18:25.700 --> 18:28.633
YOU KNOW, I'VE OWNED THE BAR
ACROSS THE STREET FOR 14 YEARS,

18:28.667 --> 18:30.800
AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN INSIDE
THIS HOSPITAL TILL NOW.

18:30.833 --> 18:34.333
LOOK, I'LL PAY MY TAB, RIGHT?
GOTTA BE GOOD FOR SOMETHING.

18:34.367 --> 18:37.233
HOW MUCH IS IT?
CLOSE TO A GRAND.

18:37.267 --> 18:40.233
UM, HOW ABOUT
I PAY, LIKE, 60...

18:40.267 --> 18:41.467
THAT'S GOOD.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.300
AND I'LL PAY
YOU BACK LATER.

18:43.333 --> 18:44.633
HEY, CHAMP!

18:51.667 --> 18:56.133
WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO GO AFTER
ANOTHER WOMAN'S HUSBAND?

18:56.167 --> 18:58.567
EXCUSE ME?
HAPPENED TO ME.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.467
JEFF MOVED IN WITH
THE LONG-LEGGED MINISKIRT

19:00.500 --> 19:02.767
WHO ANSWERS HIS PHONES
THREE WEEKS INTO MY PREGNANCY.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.633
BY THE WAY,
THAT GEL IS REALLY COLD.

19:04.667 --> 19:07.233
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.

19:07.267 --> 19:08.600
ARE YOU SORRY ABOUT

19:08.633 --> 19:11.800
DR. MONTGOMERY SHEPHERD'S
HUSBAND?

19:11.833 --> 19:14.667
I'M GOING TO BE CHECKING
A FEW THINGS TODAY.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.800
I BET SHE ASKED
TO WORK WITH YOU.

19:16.833 --> 19:18.567
IT'S WHAT
I WOULD HAVE DONE.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.733
I'M GONNA GO
CHECK ON YOUR LABS.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.633
(retching)

19:31.533 --> 19:34.333
(toilet flushes)

19:38.333 --> 19:40.267
HEY, SUNSHINE.

19:41.867 --> 19:43.800
DEEP BREATH.

19:47.467 --> 19:50.367
MORNING SICKNESS MUST SUCK.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.633
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR--
DO NOT BREATHE A WORD

19:53.667 --> 19:57.100
OF WHAT YOU HEARD LAST NIGHT
TO ANYONE--NOT ABOUT ME,

19:57.133 --> 19:59.300
NOT ABOUT MEREDITH, NOT ABOUT
MEREDITH AND DR. McDREAMY.

19:59.333 --> 20:02.133
HEY, DR. BURKE.
JOE.

20:02.167 --> 20:05.167
UM, VITAL SIGNS
STABLE OVERNIGHT.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.533
TODAY'S C.T. SHOWS
NO REBLEEDING.

20:07.567 --> 20:09.600
THE E.K.G...

20:09.633 --> 20:12.200
SHOWS...

20:12.233 --> 20:13.667
UM...

20:13.700 --> 20:16.300
NORMAL SINUS RHYTHM.

20:16.333 --> 20:20.067
NO ISCHEMIA,
NO DISRHYTHMIAS.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.733
LOOKING GOOD.

20:22.767 --> 20:25.067
PAGE ME IF THERE ARE
ANY CHANGES.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.733
OH, HI, CHIEF.

20:28.767 --> 20:30.833
NO, NOT MUCH GOING ON--

20:30.867 --> 20:32.567
WELL, OTHER THAN
YOUR INTERIM CHIEF

20:32.600 --> 20:36.300
MAKING OUT WITH MY FRIEND
IN THE STAIRWELL.

20:36.333 --> 20:38.200
BUT, HEY,
SPONGE DUTY SUCKS.

20:38.233 --> 20:39.667
TALKING TO YOURSELF NOW?

20:39.700 --> 20:41.267
YES. NO!

20:41.300 --> 20:44.500
DAMN IT. I'M A BAD SPONGE,
A LEAKY SPONGE.

20:44.533 --> 20:46.767
I'M GONNA LEAK
ALL THE WRONG SECRETS,

20:46.800 --> 20:48.533
'CAUSE I'M A BAD LIAR.

20:48.567 --> 20:50.700
I CAN'T EVEN LIE
ABOUT TALKING TO MYSELF.

20:50.733 --> 20:52.800
***

20:52.833 --> 20:55.100
YOU LOOK NICE TODAY.

20:55.133 --> 20:57.033
WORE MY NEW LIP GLOSS.

20:57.067 --> 20:58.467
'CAUSE MY EX-BOYFRIEND'S WIFE

20:58.500 --> 21:01.067
LOOKS LIKE
ISABELLA FREAKIN' ROSSELLINI,

21:01.100 --> 21:03.467
AND I'M LIKE...

21:03.500 --> 21:05.467
ME.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.833
I'M TRYING TO OUTDO HER
WHEN SHE'S THE VICTIM HERE.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.367
HOW CRAZY IS THAT?

21:10.400 --> 21:11.633
NOT CRAZY.

21:11.667 --> 21:12.667
SMART.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.200
YOU KNOW, GLOSS, YOU KNOW,
PREVENTS CHAPPED LIPS...

21:15.233 --> 21:17.367
AND... (stammers)

21:17.400 --> 21:19.267
EX-BOYFRIEND?

21:19.300 --> 21:21.533
I'M AN EVIL MISTRESS.

21:21.567 --> 21:24.333
WELL, STILL, YOU LOOK NICE.

21:24.367 --> 21:27.767
THANKS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:27.800 --> 21:30.067
WELL...

21:30.067 --> 21:32.667
COME ON, O'MALLEY.
OUT WITH IT.

21:32.700 --> 21:34.700
OKAY. CAN YOU THINK
OF ANY REASON,

21:34.733 --> 21:36.267
ANY REASON AT ALL, REALLY,

21:36.300 --> 21:38.700
WHY CRISTINA
WOULD BE KISSING BURKE?

21:54.100 --> 21:55.633
(bell dings)

21:55.667 --> 21:56.700
(whispering)
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

21:56.733 --> 21:59.200
ALL YOUR WARNINGS ABOUT ME
SLEEPING WITH MY BOSS,

21:59.233 --> 22:00.200
AND YOU'RE DOING
THE SAME EXACT THING?

22:00.233 --> 22:01.467
IT'S NOT THE SAME.
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME!

22:01.500 --> 22:03.400
YOU AND McDREAMY
ARE IN A RELATIONSHIP.

22:03.433 --> 22:05.333
AND YOU AND BURKE ARE IN...
SWITZERLAND.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.667
IT'S VERY NEUTRAL THERE.
THEY MAKE VERY NICE WATCHES.

22:07.700 --> 22:10.500
HAVE YOU EVEN BOTHERED
TO TELL BURKE ABOUT THE BABY?

22:10.533 --> 22:12.433
ARE YOU GOING TO?

22:12.467 --> 22:15.167
LOOK, MEREDITH,
CAN WE NOT GO THERE?

22:15.200 --> 22:16.767
CAN EVERYONE JUST ACCEPT
THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

22:16.800 --> 22:18.633
SOME THINGS THAT I LIKE
TO KEEP TO MYSELF,

22:18.667 --> 22:20.567
AND I DON'T DISCUSS
EVERYTHING TO DEATH?

22:20.600 --> 22:22.500
WELL, WHY EVEN CONFIDE
IN ME AT ALL

22:22.533 --> 22:25.267
IF YOU'RE SO INTENT
ON NOT DISCUSSING IT?

22:25.300 --> 22:27.367
WHY EVEN TELL ME?

22:32.467 --> 22:35.833
WHEN I FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE MINISKIRT,

22:35.867 --> 22:38.367
I CALLED HER UP
AND TOOK HER TO LUNCH.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.633
IT WAS PERFECTLY CIVIL.

22:39.667 --> 22:42.600
I SAID I DIDN'T HOLD IT AGAINST
HER, THAT THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

22:42.633 --> 22:45.767
BUT REALLY, I JUST WANTED
TO PUT A FACE ON THE BITCH

22:45.800 --> 22:48.733
THAT GOT MY HUSBAND TO THROW
AWAY 15 YEARS OF MARRIAGE.

22:59.767 --> 23:02.233
GOT A SECOND?

23:02.267 --> 23:04.133
DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU NEED.

23:04.167 --> 23:06.433
WHO THE HELL IS
DR. McDREAMY?

23:11.100 --> 23:14.100
ME. I'M DR. McDREAMY.

23:14.133 --> 23:17.600
I'M TALL AND HANDSOME.
I LIKE TO LEAN AGAINST THINGS,

23:17.633 --> 23:20.667
PONDER THE DIFFICULTIES
OF DATING BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.833
I'M TRYING
TO BE A SURGEON HERE.

23:22.867 --> 23:25.133
THAT TOOK A LOT OF NERVE,
REQUESTING MEREDITH.

23:25.167 --> 23:26.567
OH, COME ON. SHE CAME
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
RIGHT.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.833
SO YOU DON'T RECOMMEND HER?
NO, I DID NOT SAY THAT.

23:28.867 --> 23:30.500
JUST NOT
FOR HER MEDICAL SKILLS.
OH, WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

23:30.533 --> 23:31.700
DR. SHEPHERD?

23:31.733 --> 23:32.933
YES.
YES.

23:32.967 --> 23:35.300
LABS CONFIRM WHAT LOOK LIKE
ABNORMALITIES ON THE ULTRASOUND.

23:35.333 --> 23:37.633
I THINK YOU SHOULD COME
AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.

23:37.667 --> 23:39.133
FINE. LET'S GO.
MEREDITH.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.633
MEREDITH.
DON'T.

23:40.667 --> 23:42.133
(sighs)

23:51.600 --> 23:54.533
WELL, NO REPORT.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.733
YEAH. SAME NOTHING
AS EARLIER, CHIEF.

23:56.767 --> 23:58.200
I SHOULD GO.

23:58.233 --> 24:00.200
OH, ACTUALLY,
THERE IS SOMETHING, SIR.

24:00.233 --> 24:03.800
BURKE AND SHEPHERD MARKING
TERRITORY ON THE PLAYGROUND?
NO, SIR.

24:03.833 --> 24:10.700
IT'S ABOUT JOE THE BARTENDER,
THEIR STANDSTILL PATIENT.

24:10.733 --> 24:13.700
SEE?
BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSION

24:13.733 --> 24:16.467
WITH EVIDENCE
OF SUB-Q EDEMA.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.533
IN ENGLISH, PLEASE?

24:18.567 --> 24:20.433
WE'VE DETECTED
WHAT LOOKS LIKE

24:20.467 --> 24:22.333
BEGINNING HEART FAILURE
IN THE TWINS.

24:22.367 --> 24:24.333
DON'T BE ALARMED.

24:24.367 --> 24:26.133
ARE MY BABIES
GONNA BE OKAY?

24:26.167 --> 24:29.167
I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND TAKE YOU INTO SURGERY NOW.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.467
WE'RE NOT GONNA WAIT.
BOOK THE O.R. MOVE!

24:31.500 --> 24:33.400
TELL PETE TO WASH OUT
THE TAPS EVERY NIGHT--

24:33.433 --> 24:35.300
NOT EVERY OTHER NIGHT,
EVERY NIGHT.

24:35.333 --> 24:37.667
AND REMIND HIM THAT THE DELIVERY
TRUCK COMES AT 6 A.M.

24:37.700 --> 24:39.167
KEGS GO IN THE BACK.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.167
OH, ANOTHER THING--
THERE'S PETTY CASH

24:41.200 --> 24:43.567
ON THE TOP SHELF
OF THE STORAGE CLOSET.

24:43.600 --> 24:46.367
WE'RE SURGEONS, O'MALLEY.
WE OPERATE ON OUR PATIENTS.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.400
THAT'S IT.

24:47.433 --> 24:49.300
I KNOW, BUT--
I SYMPATHIZE. I DO.

24:49.333 --> 24:51.233
BUT SOLVING JOE'S FINANCES
IS NOT MY JOB.

24:51.267 --> 24:53.400
IT'S NOT YOUR JOB,
AND IT'S SURE AS HELL

24:53.433 --> 24:55.500
NOT THE JOB
I ASSIGNED YOU TODAY.

24:55.533 --> 24:57.433
JUST SEEMS WRONG
TO CUT HIM OPEN,

24:57.467 --> 24:59.667
SEW HIM UP AND JUST LEAVE HIM,
YOU KNOW, LEFT WITH NOTHING.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.200
IF WE CAN SAVE HIS LIFE,

25:01.233 --> 25:03.133
WE'LL HARDLY BE LEAVING
HIM WITH NOTHING.

25:08.867 --> 25:11.300
THAT'S AS FAR
AS I CAN GO FOR NOW.

25:11.333 --> 25:13.167
LET'S START COOLING HIM.

25:28.633 --> 25:31.467
CAN'T SEE MUCH
FROM BACK HERE, O'MALLEY.

25:31.500 --> 25:35.367
I KNOW. I'M TRYING TO FIND
A LOOPHOLE TO HELP JOE.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.300
YOU KNOW JOE?

25:37.333 --> 25:40.233
OH, YEAH. I WAS THE ONLY
FEMALE INTERN MY YEAR.

25:40.267 --> 25:43.433
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY,
AND NOBODY KNEW ME EXCEPT JOE.

25:43.467 --> 25:44.633
HE KNEW ME.

25:44.667 --> 25:46.067
OH.

25:46.100 --> 25:48.700
SO YOU AND JOE...

25:48.733 --> 25:50.667
ALL YOU PEOPLE
EVER THINK ABOUT

25:50.700 --> 25:52.733
IS HOW TO GET
INTO SOMEBODY'S PANTS.

25:52.767 --> 25:55.500
YOU'RE NASTY.
THAT'S WHY YOU GOT SYPHILIS.

25:55.533 --> 25:58.133
JOE WAS THE FIRST PERSON HERE
TO TELL ME

25:58.167 --> 26:01.067
I'D MAKE A GOOD SURGEON, NOT
THAT HE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

26:01.067 --> 26:03.833
BUT IT WAS SOMETHING
WHEN I HAD NOTHING.

26:03.867 --> 26:06.400
OH, SURE. I'M THE GUY
WITH THE HEART OF STONE,

26:06.433 --> 26:08.333
AND YOU BROUGHT SNACKS.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.833
IT'S A WORKING LUNCH.

26:09.867 --> 26:11.567
SNACKS TO WATCH JOE DIE.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.533
HE'S NOT GONNA DIE-DIE.
THEY'LL BRING HIM BACK.

26:13.567 --> 26:15.467
HE IS GOING TO DIE-DIE.
NO PULSE-PULSE.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.333
HE'S GONNA BE DEAD-DEAD.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.700
IT'S A GRANOLA BAR, ALEX,
NOT A BAG OF SUPERSIZE POPCORN

26:19.733 --> 26:22.600
AND A BOX OF CHOCOLATE
MOVIE MINTS.
THAT'S IT.

26:22.633 --> 26:25.267
DEAD.

26:25.300 --> 26:27.433
EXCUSE ME. SORRY.

26:28.100 --> 26:30.433
(Addison) WE'RE JUST GOING
TO GO IN LAPAROSCOPICALLY.

26:30.467 --> 26:32.067
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO FEEL ANYTHING.

26:32.067 --> 26:34.267
NEITHER ARE THE TWINS.

26:34.300 --> 26:35.567
OKAY, LET'S GET GOING.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.833
THIN BLADE.

26:37.867 --> 26:40.667
BEGIN WITH
A 3-MILLIMETER INCISION.

26:46.433 --> 26:48.333
(monitor beeping)

26:48.367 --> 26:50.133
STOP THE BLOOD FLOW?

26:50.167 --> 26:52.433
TO PROTECT THE BRAIN,
OPERATE IN A BLOODLESS FIELD

26:52.467 --> 26:54.367
SO THE ANEURYSM
WON'T RUPTURE.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.767
AND COOL THE BODY?

26:55.800 --> 26:57.633
TO INDUCE HYPOTHERMIA.

26:57.667 --> 26:59.700
KEEPS THE TISSUE VIABLE
UNTIL THE BLOOD IS RESTORED.

26:59.733 --> 27:02.100
(loud beep)
BODY TEMP IS AT 60 DEGREES.

27:02.133 --> 27:04.800
OKAY, JOE. TIME TO DIE.

27:18.733 --> 27:20.600
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

27:20.633 --> 27:22.633
FLATLINE.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.667
ALL RIGHT.
WE'VE GOT 45 MINUTES, PEOPLE.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.633
START THE CLOCK.

27:39.300 --> 27:40.833
SO WHAT'S YOUR JOE STORY?

27:40.867 --> 27:43.600
SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY
AROUND HERE HAS ONE.

27:43.633 --> 27:45.300
YOU FIRST.

27:45.333 --> 27:47.233
OKAY. I WENT TO JOE'S PLACE

27:47.267 --> 27:48.233
THE NIGHT BEFORE
I STARTED WORKING HERE.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.400
I'D ONLY BEEN IN TOWN,
YOU KNOW, A FEW DAYS.

27:50.433 --> 27:53.533
I MET THIS WOMAN. I GOT DRUNK,
AND SHE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME.

27:53.567 --> 27:55.333
OR SHE GOT DRUNK,
AND I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HER.

27:55.367 --> 27:58.133
I GOT DRUNK AND SHE TOOK--NO.
WE WERE DRUNK, DEFINITELY.

27:58.167 --> 27:59.367
SOMEBODY TOOK ADVANTAGE.

27:59.400 --> 28:02.300
EITHER WAY, I LIKE TO LOOK AT IT
AS MY INITIATION TO SEATTLE.

28:02.333 --> 28:03.433
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

28:03.467 --> 28:08.067
OH, WELL, I DON'T HAVE ONE.
I JUST WANTED TO HEAR YOURS.

28:08.067 --> 28:10.733
***

28:14.567 --> 28:16.733
SO TECHNICALLY THE PAPERWORK
JUST NEEDS TO BE SUBMITTED

28:16.767 --> 28:19.600
BY MIDNIGHT OF THE DAY
OF THE SURGERY TO BE CONSIDERED?

28:19.633 --> 28:22.333
OH, GOOD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.267
THANKS.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.067
HOW YOU DOING THERE, GREY?

28:28.100 --> 28:29.733
GOOD.

28:29.767 --> 28:31.067
I'M GOOD.

28:37.633 --> 28:40.067
YOU KNOW, I'M VERY SWEET
ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW ME.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

28:40.100 --> 28:41.500
WE COULD BE GOOD FRIENDS.

28:41.533 --> 28:43.433
ALEX, NEVER. EVER.

28:43.467 --> 28:44.400
EVER.

28:44.433 --> 28:45.200
WHY NOT?

28:45.233 --> 28:47.200
YOU GIVE ME ONE REASON
WHY WE COULD.

28:47.233 --> 28:50.167
WHAT ABOUT YOU IS EVEN
REMOTELY HUMAN?

28:50.200 --> 28:52.200
IT'S GOING TOO SLOWLY.

28:52.233 --> 28:54.133
I HOPE JOE
CAN PULL THROUGH THIS.

28:54.167 --> 28:56.333
HE CAN. HE WILL.
HE HAS TO.

28:56.367 --> 28:58.500
(Derek)
AH, DAMN IT.

28:58.533 --> 29:00.733
UH-OH.
I CAN'T GET THE CLAMP TO HOLD.

29:00.767 --> 29:03.267
GIVE ME--ALL RIGHT,

29:03.300 --> 29:04.733
WE'RE JUST GONNA GO IN
AT A DIFFERENT ANGLE.

29:04.767 --> 29:06.400
TIME REMAINING?

29:06.433 --> 29:08.233
(Derek) IRRIGATION, PLEASE.
IRRIGATION.

29:08.267 --> 29:11.600
17 MINUTES.
SHEPHERD, I'M GONNA NEED
8 MINUTES TO GET HIM BACK,

29:11.633 --> 29:13.733
TO WARM HIM UP.

29:13.767 --> 29:15.833
TIME TO MAKE
THE NEXT 17 MINUTES COUNT.

29:15.867 --> 29:17.833
RIGHT THERE.
GO IN THROUGH THERE.

29:17.867 --> 29:20.067
YOU SEE IT?

29:21.667 --> 29:24.067
(George) HE'S DEAD, TECHNICALLY,
WHICH IS LIKE SCIENCE,

29:24.067 --> 29:25.567
A HUGE THING.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.467
SO I THOUGHT
SOME RESEARCH FOUNDATION

29:27.500 --> 29:29.400
HAS GOTTA HAVE
AN INTEREST IN THAT.

29:29.433 --> 29:30.600
SO IN ESSENCE,

29:30.633 --> 29:32.533
YOU WANNA DONATE
JOE'S BODY TO SCIENCE?

29:32.567 --> 29:34.467
AT LEAST
FOR THE NEXT 17 MINUTES.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.100
A PRIVATELY FUNDED GRANT.

29:36.133 --> 29:38.800
FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.
WE'RE A TEACHING HOSPITAL.

29:38.833 --> 29:40.833
THE STANDSTILL SURGERY
QUALIFIES.

29:40.867 --> 29:42.767
I DIDN'T PEG YOU
FOR THE TYPE

29:42.800 --> 29:44.433
TO IGNORE MY INSTRUCTIONS,
O'MALLEY.

29:44.467 --> 29:45.800
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR,
IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

29:45.833 --> 29:47.500
IT'S SOMEONE'S LIFE.

29:47.533 --> 29:49.533
IT'S ALWAYS
SOMEONE'S LIFE, O'MALLEY.

29:55.300 --> 29:57.267
YOU'RE HOVERING.

29:58.300 --> 30:00.767
YOU CAN LEAVE NOW.

30:05.667 --> 30:07.467
(Woman) EIGHT MINUTES.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.467
WE NEED TO START REWARMING,
SHEPHERD.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.500
TAKE THE BIPOLARS, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

30:12.533 --> 30:15.333
SHEPHERD, WE NEED TO START
WARMING HIM UP NOW.

30:15.367 --> 30:16.267
HANG ON.
I CAN'T SEEM TO--

30:16.300 --> 30:19.100
(Preston) NOW.
I NEED HIM NOW, SHEPHERD.

30:19.133 --> 30:20.533
I CAN'T SEEM TO GET IT.

30:20.567 --> 30:23.433
AH, THERE IT IS.

30:23.467 --> 30:25.733
GOT IT.

30:25.767 --> 30:27.267
THAT'S IT.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.267
ARE YOU SURE?
I'M ALWAYS SURE.

30:29.300 --> 30:31.467
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD WORK, EVERYBODY.

30:31.500 --> 30:33.400
IT'S ALL YOURS THERE, CHIEF.

30:33.433 --> 30:36.367
(laughs) OKAY, PEOPLE,
LET'S GRAB JOE

30:36.400 --> 30:38.600
BEFORE HE DECIDES
TO GO INTO THE LIGHT.

30:38.633 --> 30:41.033
START WARMING HIM UP.
CLAMPS ARE COMING OFF.

30:41.067 --> 30:43.100
TURN THE PUMP ON.

30:45.133 --> 30:48.700
WATCH CEREBRAL PERFUSION
PRESSURES.

30:48.733 --> 30:51.000
KEEP M.A.P.
GREATER THAN 60, PLEASE.

30:57.567 --> 30:59.667
(Richard) I KNOW YOU'RE
ENJOYING YOURSELF, PRESTON.

30:59.700 --> 31:01.567
IT'S A POWER KICK
TO BE THE CHIEF.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.600
YOU'RE NEVER MORE
SURROUNDED,

31:03.633 --> 31:05.233
NEVER MORE ALONE.

31:05.267 --> 31:07.167
YOU'RE EVERYONE'S FATHER,
EVERYONE'S BOSS

31:07.200 --> 31:08.667
AND OLD FRIEND.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.700
THE CHOICES WE MAKE--
CLEAN SLICES, NEAT STITCHES,

31:11.733 --> 31:14.800
NO EMOTIONS, NO COMPROMISE,
NO PERSONAL LIFE.

31:14.833 --> 31:15.767
RICHARD--

31:15.800 --> 31:17.833
I JUST HAD BRAIN SURGERY.

31:17.867 --> 31:22.400
I'M SURROUNDED
BY FRUIT BASKETS.

31:22.433 --> 31:24.333
THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO'VE BEEN IN THIS ROOM

31:24.367 --> 31:26.067
COME TO KISS MY ASS.

31:26.100 --> 31:29.200
I GAVE YOU A SHOT
FOR A REASON, PRESTON.

31:29.233 --> 31:31.367
YOU AND I...

31:31.400 --> 31:34.133
WE'RE THE SAME.

31:35.833 --> 31:38.600
WE PUT THE JOB FIRST.

31:48.333 --> 31:50.533
THAT WAS THE SINGLE
MOST AMAZING SURGERY

31:50.567 --> 31:52.233
I HAVE EVER WITNESSED.

31:52.267 --> 31:55.133
YOU--YOU KILLED A MAN
AND BROUGHT HIM BACK TO LIFE.

31:55.167 --> 31:56.200
YOU, LIKE, RAISED THE DEAD.

31:56.233 --> 31:58.800
GOD, HOW DOES THAT FEEL?
ARE YOU RUSHING? IS IT...

31:58.833 --> 32:00.633
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

32:00.667 --> 32:03.600
HEY, UM, DO YOU STILL HAVE
THOSE RESERVATIONS?

32:03.633 --> 32:05.300
'CAUSE I'M STARVING.

32:05.333 --> 32:06.500
CRISTINA...

32:06.533 --> 32:09.200
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
WE SHOULD DISCUSS.

32:11.533 --> 32:15.467
YEAH. YEAH, THERE IS.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.700
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR.

32:18.733 --> 32:20.067
IT IS?

32:20.100 --> 32:22.200
WE'VE BEEN
FOOLING OURSELVES,

32:22.233 --> 32:24.633
TO THINK THAT WE CAN
CONTINUE LIKE THIS

32:24.667 --> 32:25.833
WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES.

32:25.867 --> 32:27.567
CONSEQUENCES?

32:27.600 --> 32:29.533
WE HAVE CAREERS
TO THINK ABOUT,

32:29.567 --> 32:31.333
REPUTATIONS.

32:31.367 --> 32:33.400
WE BOTH PUT THE JOB FIRST.

32:33.433 --> 32:37.200
AND YOU ARE VERY FOCUSED.
I RESPECT THAT.

32:37.233 --> 32:38.533
THANK YOU.

32:38.567 --> 32:40.067
YOU'RE WELCOME.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.733
OH, YOU'RE ENDING THIS.

32:45.767 --> 32:49.533
I THINK IT'S BEST
TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAK.

32:49.567 --> 32:50.500
OKAY.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.467
BEFORE IT GETS
TOO INVOLVED.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.400
BEFORE IT GETS--

32:54.433 --> 32:56.333
MESSY. RIGHT, RIGHT.
THAT WOULD BE--

32:56.367 --> 32:58.267
THAT WOULD BE BAD.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.700
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.800
NO.

33:35.567 --> 33:37.133
GET IN HERE, O'MALLEY.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.767
OKAY, I TRIED.
I REALLY TRIED.

33:47.800 --> 33:50.100
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF
HAPPENING OUT THERE--

33:50.133 --> 33:51.833
STUFF I CAN'T TELL YOU,

33:51.867 --> 33:54.500
STUFF I WON'T TELL YOU.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.200
(stammers)

33:56.233 --> 33:57.733
IT'S JUST CRAZY STUFF--

33:57.767 --> 34:00.700
STUFF I'M GONNA HAVE
NIGHTMARES ABOUT.

34:00.733 --> 34:03.600
BUT I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU
ABOUT ANY OF IT

34:03.633 --> 34:05.133
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER.

34:05.167 --> 34:07.133
NOT WHEN
THERE'S A GUY OUT THERE

34:07.167 --> 34:09.067
WHO WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE
WHO'S GONNA BE BANKRUPT

34:09.100 --> 34:10.833
BECAUSE HE NEEDED A SURGERY
TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

34:10.867 --> 34:12.767
AND I SPENT THE WHOLE DAY
WORKING ON IT.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.300
O'MALLEY--
LET ME FINISH.

34:15.600 --> 34:18.233
YOU'RE WRONG, SIR.

34:18.267 --> 34:19.600
NOW YOU CAN FIRE ME,

34:19.633 --> 34:21.767
YOU KNOW, OR JUST BRING ME UP
ON DISCIPLINARY ACTION,

34:21.800 --> 34:23.067
OR WHATEVER.

34:23.067 --> 34:25.833
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
JOE DESERVES OUR--
DESERVES OUR HELP.

34:25.867 --> 34:28.600
COULDN'T HELP YOURSELF,
COULD YOU?

34:28.633 --> 34:31.400
WHETHER OR NOT
IT'D WIN YOU ANY POINTS,

34:31.433 --> 34:32.833
EVEN FROM ME.

34:32.867 --> 34:35.067
I SIGNED YOUR REQUEST.
GIVE IT TO PATRICIA.

34:35.100 --> 34:36.800
SHE'LL KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

34:36.833 --> 34:38.600
LOOKS LIKE JOE MIGHT KEEP
HIS BAR AFTER ALL.

34:38.633 --> 34:40.100
THANK YOU, SIR.

34:40.133 --> 34:41.067
O'MALLEY.

34:41.100 --> 34:42.067
YES.

34:42.067 --> 34:43.400
YELL AT ME AGAIN,

34:43.433 --> 34:45.333
AND I'LL SNAP YOU
LIKE A TWIG.

34:45.367 --> 34:46.733
YES, SIR.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.400
(Addison)
SEE? JUST A SMALL SCAR.

34:51.433 --> 34:53.700
AND MY BABIES?

34:55.367 --> 34:58.433
YOUR BABIES ARE DOING
VERY WELL.

34:58.467 --> 34:59.667
AHEM.

34:59.700 --> 35:01.200
AND DR. GREY WILL BE BACK

35:01.233 --> 35:03.133
TO CHECK ON YOU
A LITTLE BIT LATER.

35:03.167 --> 35:04.500
ACTUALLY, I'D PREFER IT

35:04.533 --> 35:06.133
IF DR. GREY WERE
TAKEN OFF THE CASE.

35:06.167 --> 35:07.500
WHY? IS THERE A PROBLEM?

35:07.533 --> 35:10.267
JUST REMINDS ME OF SOMEONE
I DON'T LIKE VERY MUCH--

35:10.300 --> 35:12.200
SOMEONE MY HUSBAND
LIKES A LOT,

35:12.233 --> 35:13.600
PARTICULARLY IN LINGERIE.

35:13.633 --> 35:15.133
YOU UNDERSTAND.

35:15.167 --> 35:17.167
NO, NO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.067
WELL, SHE'S SLEEPING
WITH YOUR HUSBAND, RIGHT?

35:21.800 --> 35:23.700
MS. PHILLIPS...

35:23.733 --> 35:27.067
I LACK DR. GREY'S CLASS
AND PATIENCE,

35:27.067 --> 35:29.067
SO LET ME SET
THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

35:29.100 --> 35:32.067
MY HUSBAND DIDN'T CHEAT ON ME.
I CHEATED ON HIM.

35:32.100 --> 35:33.833
SO THE WRONGED WOMAN HERE--
DR. GREY.

35:33.867 --> 35:39.100
SO I THINK YOU OWE HER
ONE HELL OF AN APOLOGY.

35:44.500 --> 35:47.367
(Derek) ONE NIGHT

35:47.400 --> 35:49.067
I PARK MY CAR

35:49.100 --> 35:53.067
AND UNLOCK MY FRONT DOOR
TO GO INSIDE MY HOUSE,

35:53.067 --> 35:55.433
AND SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT.

35:55.467 --> 35:57.733
NOTHING'S DIFFERENT,
EVERYTHING'S THE SAME,

35:57.767 --> 36:00.600
BUT YET STILL...

36:00.633 --> 36:02.333
SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT.

36:03.833 --> 36:06.067
AND I STAND THERE
FOR AWHILE...

36:08.767 --> 36:12.100
AND THEN I KNOW.

36:12.133 --> 36:15.067
SEE, THERE ARE MOMENTS FOR ME,

36:15.067 --> 36:18.300
USUALLY WHEN I'M IN THE O.R.,

36:18.333 --> 36:22.267
WHEN I JUST KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT.

36:27.533 --> 36:29.300
SO I GO UPSTAIRS.

36:29.333 --> 36:32.233
WALKING DOWN THE HALL,
I'M TRYING TO PREPARE MYSELF

36:32.267 --> 36:34.300
FOR WHAT I'M GOING TO SEE
IN MY BEDROOM.

36:34.333 --> 36:37.433
I STEP ON A MAN'S JACKET
THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO ME.

36:38.800 --> 36:41.700
AND EVERYTHING I THINK I KNOW...

36:41.733 --> 36:45.100
JUST SHIFTS.

36:45.133 --> 36:47.067
BECAUSE THE JACKET
THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO ME

36:47.100 --> 36:48.833
IS A JACKET THAT I RECOGNIZE.

36:48.867 --> 36:52.300
AND WHAT I KNOW NOW IS THAT
WHEN I GO INTO MY BEDROOM,

36:52.333 --> 36:55.200
I'M NOT JUST GONNA SEE
THAT MY WIFE IS CHEATING ON ME.

36:55.233 --> 36:58.500
I'M GONNA SEE THAT MY WIFE
IS CHEATING ON ME WITH MARK,

36:58.533 --> 37:00.400
WHO HAPPENED TO BE
MY BEST FRIEND.

37:00.433 --> 37:02.133
MMM.

37:02.167 --> 37:04.567
IT'S JUST SO PEDESTRIAN

37:04.600 --> 37:09.067
AND COMMON AND DIRTY
AND CRUEL.

37:09.100 --> 37:12.433
MOSTLY JUST CRUEL.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.200
I LEFT. I CAME OUT HERE.

37:16.233 --> 37:18.600
AND YOU MET ME.

37:18.633 --> 37:21.133
AND I MET YOU.

37:28.500 --> 37:31.700
WELL, WHAT WAS I TO YOU?

37:31.733 --> 37:35.567
THE GIRL YOU SCREWED
TO GET OVER BEING SCREWED?

37:37.533 --> 37:40.700
YOU WERE LIKE COMING UP
FOR FRESH AIR.

37:40.733 --> 37:43.667
IT'S LIKE I WAS DROWNING,
AND YOU SAVED ME.

37:46.233 --> 37:48.800
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

37:48.833 --> 37:53.433
***

37:55.633 --> 37:58.467
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

38:03.167 --> 38:07.067
THEY SAY
"PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT."

38:15.233 --> 38:16.733
THEORY IS,

38:16.767 --> 38:20.200
THE MORE YOU THINK
LIKE A SURGEON,

38:20.233 --> 38:23.067
THE MORE YOU BECOME ONE...

38:25.200 --> 38:27.200
THE BETTER YOU GET
AT REMAINING NEUTRAL,

38:27.233 --> 38:28.733
CLINICAL--

38:28.767 --> 38:33.133
CUT, SUTURE, CLOSE...

38:39.167 --> 38:43.333
AND THE HARDER IT BECOMES
TO LEARN TO TURN IT OFF...

38:43.367 --> 38:48.067
I THOUGHT I MIGHT SEE
YOUR UGLY MUG IN HERE TONIGHT.

38:48.100 --> 38:50.733
DID YOU HEAR THE GOOD NEWS?

38:50.767 --> 38:52.633
TO STOP THINKING
LIKE A SURGEON...

38:52.667 --> 38:55.167
(Alex) O'MALLEY!

39:06.167 --> 39:09.100
I HEARD WHAT YOU DID, CHAMP.

39:11.400 --> 39:15.267
AND REMEMBER WHAT IT MEANS
TO THINK LIKE A HUMAN BEING.

39:37.667 --> 39:40.200
THE CLINIC HAS A POLICY.

39:40.233 --> 39:42.133
THEY WOULDN'T LET ME
CONFIRM MY APPOINTMENT

39:42.167 --> 39:45.600
UNLESS I DESIGNATED
AN EMERGENCY CONTACT PERSON--

39:45.633 --> 39:49.300
SOMEONE TO BE THERE
JUST IN CASE AND...

39:49.333 --> 39:50.833
TO HELP ME HOME,

39:50.867 --> 39:53.267
YOU KNOW, AFTER.

39:58.633 --> 40:01.667
ANYWAY, I PUT YOUR NAME DOWN.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.600
THAT'S WHY I TOLD YOU
I'M PREGNANT.

40:03.633 --> 40:05.133
YOU'RE MY PERSON.

40:05.167 --> 40:06.833
I AM?

40:06.867 --> 40:10.333
YEAH, YOU ARE.

40:10.367 --> 40:12.200
WHATEVER.

40:12.233 --> 40:14.567
WHATEVER.

40:17.533 --> 40:20.233
HE DUMPED ME.

40:31.300 --> 40:33.733
YOU REALIZE
THIS CONSTITUTES HUGGING?

40:33.767 --> 40:35.633
SHUT UP.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.600
I'M YOUR PERSON.
