00:52.975 --> 00:56.626
<i> Believe it or
not, this is a love story.</i>

00:58.417 --> 01:01.275
<i>We should probably
back up to the beginning...</i>

01:02.570 --> 01:05.548
<i>and our dreamy,
romantic lead.</i>

01:07.803 --> 01:10.320
Um... something's up with Hook Foot.

01:10.397 --> 01:12.589
He hasn't moved
in I don't know how long.

01:12.666 --> 01:14.789
I'm guessing since low tide.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.027
<i> Turns out,
all of us had noticed</i>

01:17.104 --> 01:19.852
<i>Hook Foot acting strangely...</i>

01:22.912 --> 01:23.910
Hmm...

01:28.499 --> 01:29.875
Ew!

02:04.856 --> 02:07.704
Now I know why there's
grease on my mirror handle.

02:07.781 --> 02:12.357
Now I know why my walnut-cracking
stick smells like teeth.

02:12.434 --> 02:14.339
Maybe he's just in a good mood?

02:14.416 --> 02:17.353
That's the problem. Hook
Foot only has two moods:

02:17.430 --> 02:20.849
surly and... just the one mood actually.

02:20.926 --> 02:23.513
<i> Since Eugene
knew Hook Foot best,</i>

02:23.590 --> 02:25.136
<i>he volunteered to question him</i>

02:25.213 --> 02:28.921
<i>with his characteristic
tact and diplomacy.</i>

02:29.254 --> 02:30.626
What is wrong with you?

02:30.703 --> 02:33.001
You're acting strange,
and what is that weird thing

02:33.078 --> 02:35.277
you're doing with your mouth?

02:37.609 --> 02:39.935
- Smiling.
- Oh! That's how you smile.

02:40.012 --> 02:42.370
And a... And a...
a beautiful smile it is.

02:42.447 --> 02:44.481
I met someone, Eugene.

02:44.558 --> 02:46.915
Okay, always nice to meet people.

02:46.992 --> 02:49.662
No. A lady.

02:49.808 --> 02:51.053
Half of us are.

02:51.130 --> 02:53.951
No. A lady lady.

02:54.332 --> 02:56.818
You know...

02:57.682 --> 02:59.302
You? Wow! Oh!

02:59.379 --> 03:00.990
Keep your voice down.

03:02.420 --> 03:04.686
I don't want the others to know.

03:05.009 --> 03:06.878
Foot, my man,
you have my word.

03:06.955 --> 03:09.467
And believe me, I'm a vault.

03:11.738 --> 03:14.700
Hook Foot met someone?

03:14.777 --> 03:16.238
Hey!

03:16.315 --> 03:18.081
Yeah. I'm still really struggling

03:18.158 --> 03:20.834
with the whole
"this guy's a vault" thing.

03:21.090 --> 03:23.116
- Hook Foot met somebody?
- Hook Foot met somebody?

03:23.193 --> 03:25.313
- Aw, Hook Foot!
- That's great, buddy!

03:25.390 --> 03:27.198
- I'm so happy for you!
- Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.757
Is she pretty?
Oh, what's her name?

03:28.834 --> 03:30.051
What does she look like?

03:30.128 --> 03:32.354
- I am just so happy for you.
- Ooh, and he's surly again.

03:32.431 --> 03:33.721
Guys, he's back to normal!

03:33.798 --> 03:35.511
Tell us how you met her,
Hook Foot.

03:35.588 --> 03:37.670
We want all the details.

03:38.014 --> 03:39.694
All right, fine.

03:39.771 --> 03:42.623
I was collectin' firewood
the other day...

03:52.244 --> 03:53.621
Huh?

03:58.990 --> 04:02.023
That's sea glass, hon.

04:02.191 --> 04:05.661
Fun fact: they're rarer than pearls.

04:16.305 --> 04:20.067
Heya, Butterfingers. Name's Seraphina.

04:20.214 --> 04:24.375
Oh, uh, this isn't butter,
it's crab grease.

04:24.519 --> 04:26.182
I'm... I'm Hook Foot.

04:26.259 --> 04:27.518
Ya don't say.

04:27.595 --> 04:29.998
Why do they call ya that?

04:30.865 --> 04:32.655
I have a hook for a foot.

04:34.293 --> 04:37.221
You got more looks than
brains, honey.

04:37.298 --> 04:39.822
Brains.

04:39.899 --> 04:43.391
<i> Okay, so it wasn't
the most romantic story</i>

04:43.468 --> 04:45.894
<i>I ever heard,
but Hook Foot was happy</i>

04:45.971 --> 04:47.762
<i>and that's all that matters.</i>

04:47.839 --> 04:49.651
She gave me this
to remember her by

04:49.728 --> 04:51.440
and told me not to lose it.

04:51.517 --> 04:53.191
Aw!

04:53.347 --> 04:56.118
And I never will.

04:57.149 --> 04:59.245
We're even gonna do
dinner later.

04:59.322 --> 05:01.747
Hookie! You got a date!

05:01.824 --> 05:03.899
No, it's not a date.

05:03.976 --> 05:06.678
We're just gettin' together
to eat and, you know,

05:06.755 --> 05:10.756
uh, talk, and, uh...

05:14.000 --> 05:16.412
Wait! I have a date!

05:18.596 --> 05:20.831
I think he's just
a little anxious, that's all.

05:20.908 --> 05:21.964
He... He's gonna be fine.

05:22.041 --> 05:23.834
Uh, Hook Foot?

05:30.115 --> 05:31.864
You wanna grab a pulse?

05:32.017 --> 05:34.706
<i> Hook Foot had never
been on a date before,</i>

05:34.783 --> 05:37.543
<i>so Eugene and I promised to help.</i>

05:37.620 --> 05:39.886
<i>Our first step: Recon.</i>

05:39.963 --> 05:44.192
<i>We had to meet this special lad
to see who we were dealing with</i>

05:44.269 --> 05:46.555
Uh, um, oh, uh,

05:46.632 --> 05:48.471
there she is.

05:49.968 --> 05:53.247
Hey, hey, hey, hey, relax. You're
in great hands here, Foot, okay?

05:53.324 --> 05:55.223
I am the dating master.

05:57.642 --> 06:00.202
Former...
Former dating master.

06:00.279 --> 06:02.418
But I can still give you
some pointers about love.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.638
Hook Foot doesn't need pointers.

06:04.715 --> 06:07.076
He just needs
to speak from the heart.

06:07.153 --> 06:09.667
Oh, no, no, no. It's not about
speaking from the heart, Blondie.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.133
It's about the charm.

06:13.392 --> 06:17.123
Ugh, I thought that crawfish
smelled bad goin' in!

06:17.819 --> 06:19.894
Who am I kiddin'? I'm gross!

06:19.971 --> 06:21.967
Don't worry, Hookie.

06:22.044 --> 06:24.841
When I'm done with you, you're
gonna be a smooth-talking...

06:30.909 --> 06:33.675
- She's a...
- Seraphina's a mermaid?

06:33.752 --> 06:36.778
Yeah, so? You're a woman
with 70 feet of hair.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.021
And you don't see me staring.

06:39.098 --> 06:41.408
Yeah, you got me there.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.885
Lookin' forward to our date,
honey.

06:45.954 --> 06:47.643
See ya tonight!

06:53.331 --> 06:55.507
Apprehend Seraphina.

06:55.584 --> 06:57.393
The rest are...

06:57.499 --> 06:59.204
disposable.

07:01.750 --> 07:04.476
<i> So, Hook Foot was in love,</i>

07:04.553 --> 07:07.236
<i>and he had
his own way of showing it.</i>

07:07.313 --> 07:10.139
I'm so nervous
my ears are sweatin'!

07:10.216 --> 07:11.307
Anybody got a rag?

07:11.384 --> 07:13.115
Hey, hey,
can I use your horse tail?

07:15.121 --> 07:16.778
I guess that's a nay.

07:16.855 --> 07:19.462
You know, Foot,
after describing her eyes,

07:19.539 --> 07:21.752
her chin, even the
birthmark on her chin,

07:21.829 --> 07:23.960
you'd think at some point,
you'd get around to mentioning

07:24.037 --> 07:25.736
that's she's half fish!

07:25.867 --> 07:28.156
I don't care if she's half fish!

07:28.233 --> 07:30.232
She's got a heart and I got a heart!

07:30.309 --> 07:31.975
And my heart, it burns!

07:32.052 --> 07:33.703
Sometimes
it's 'cause I eat too fast.

07:33.780 --> 07:35.964
But also, it burns with loneliness.

07:36.041 --> 07:38.153
Seraphina's the only person
I ever knew

07:38.230 --> 07:40.720
who could put out my burning heart

07:40.812 --> 07:43.113
and warm it up at the same time.

07:44.582 --> 07:46.709
How romantic.

07:46.828 --> 07:49.482
Okay, fine.
I'll swim with the current.

07:49.640 --> 07:53.158
Hook Foot, let's get
you ready for a date.

07:57.335 --> 07:59.199
First, we gotta
get you the right look.

07:59.276 --> 08:02.767
Let's try this one that I
like to call "the simmer."

08:17.382 --> 08:19.645
Let's not
worry about simmering.

08:19.722 --> 08:22.110
All you have to do
is be yourself.

08:22.187 --> 08:24.412
Just say
whatever comes naturally.

08:24.489 --> 08:28.216
Huh...
how can my armpits be so clammy

08:28.293 --> 08:30.341
and yet so itchy
at the same time?

08:30.839 --> 08:34.091
That's new. I wonder if I
should have that checked out.

08:34.315 --> 08:36.205
Straighten that back.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.907
Sit however you want.

08:40.503 --> 08:42.966
You gotta put
your best foot forward...

08:43.166 --> 08:47.669
and in this case, I'm gonna let
you decide which one that is.

08:48.198 --> 08:51.130
The important thing
is that you're comfortable.

08:52.617 --> 08:55.044
Hmm?

08:55.121 --> 08:57.192
Comfort's got
nothing to do with it.

08:57.269 --> 08:59.809
It's about igniting
the fires of passion.

08:59.886 --> 09:02.533
And that won't happen if sparks
aren't flying, you know.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.085
What does that even mean?

09:04.162 --> 09:06.697
Trust me, Blondie, I've
gone on tons of dates!

09:06.774 --> 09:08.441
- You have?
- With you!

09:08.518 --> 09:10.725
- Oh, uh-huh.
- And I know how love works.

09:10.802 --> 09:13.952
<i> Okay, so Eugene and I
were at a bit of an impasse.</i>

09:14.029 --> 09:17.450
<i>Still, we were both
excited when...</i>

09:19.520 --> 09:23.414
<i>the big moment
arrived.</i>

09:35.989 --> 09:38.895
Sorry about
all the ear sweat.

09:40.031 --> 09:42.590
Bonjour, bienvenue,
and welcome, I'm Eugene.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.174
I'll be taking care of you.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.799
Our first course, fresh halibut.

09:47.159 --> 09:48.696
Steve!

09:51.393 --> 09:54.040
And I'm sure Steve
is gonna pull right through.

09:54.127 --> 09:57.278
Ya know what? I'll serve myself.

09:59.925 --> 10:01.245
Kelp?

10:08.727 --> 10:10.724
Mm-mm, mm.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.302
Hmm...

10:16.569 --> 10:18.382
You know what food you might like?

10:18.459 --> 10:20.628
Try the simmer.

10:22.074 --> 10:24.171
I hear it's wonderful.

10:28.052 --> 10:30.773
Why is your face doin' that?

10:30.872 --> 10:32.192
Is the kelp not sittin' right?

10:40.630 --> 10:43.312
I see you still have
the necklace I gave you.

10:43.432 --> 10:45.913
Do you... you want it back?

10:45.990 --> 10:47.781
No, I'm just lookin'.

10:48.199 --> 10:50.201
Hey, I got you somethin', little gift.

10:50.278 --> 10:51.615
Sea glass,

10:51.849 --> 10:53.971
almost as rare as pearls.

10:54.048 --> 10:56.109
Those are called mermaid tears.

10:56.186 --> 10:58.257
You know
where those come from, right?

10:59.396 --> 11:01.632
They come from mermaids,

11:01.884 --> 11:03.810
when we cry.

11:06.919 --> 11:08.684

11:35.446 --> 11:37.486
Look, I'm just gonna be honest.

11:37.563 --> 11:38.725
This ain't me.

11:38.802 --> 11:41.116
I'm trying so hard
to impress you

11:41.193 --> 11:45.550
because I think
you're really, really special,

11:45.627 --> 11:47.238
and... and I'm not.

11:47.315 --> 11:50.910
I ain't a looker, I got a hook
foot, I got bad breath...

11:50.987 --> 11:52.623
I like your breath!

11:52.700 --> 11:56.031
Reminds me of seaweed
drying in the morning sun.

11:57.902 --> 11:59.715
Hey, you still hungry?

12:05.411 --> 12:06.896
Here!

12:09.515 --> 12:10.927

Seraphina... I think I love you.

13:13.545 --> 13:16.953
Hook Foot,
I need to tell you something.

13:19.413 --> 13:23.052
Seraphina! Your time here is up!

13:23.129 --> 13:25.992
Hook Foot! Seraphina!

13:26.069 --> 13:28.090
- Jump!
- Here ya go!

13:33.665 --> 13:34.666
Run!

13:39.979 --> 13:42.178
After them!

13:54.420 --> 13:56.085
Come on! Let's scram!

14:03.694 --> 14:05.787
Now this is my kind of date!

14:09.618 --> 14:11.830
Don't worry.
No matter what it takes,

14:11.907 --> 14:13.886
I'll protect you from the bad guys.

14:13.963 --> 14:15.732
That's the thing, Hook Foot.

14:15.809 --> 14:17.785
They're not the bad guys.

14:18.686 --> 14:19.955
I am.

14:36.295 --> 14:39.128
<i> So this is
where we came in before.</i>

14:39.205 --> 14:43.880
Okay, we have to give Hook Foot
and Seraphina time to escape!

14:43.957 --> 14:46.698
We had half-fish people,
now we have full-fish people!

14:46.775 --> 14:49.417
What kind of anthropomorphic
game are you playing?

14:49.494 --> 14:53.467
We are vodniks, and
we enforce the laws of the sea!

14:55.622 --> 14:56.844
Oh, boy.

15:01.752 --> 15:03.462
I have you now.

15:04.672 --> 15:06.355
Yeah, well you brought forks...

15:06.432 --> 15:08.397
to a knife fight.

15:10.626 --> 15:12.772
Vodniks, step away!

15:22.250 --> 15:24.544
That's not how knife fights work!

15:24.621 --> 15:28.203
You are under arrest
for abetting Seraphina,

15:28.280 --> 15:30.221
wanted thief of the deep!

15:31.016 --> 15:32.227
Thief?

15:36.055 --> 15:37.853
Wait, you're the bad guy?

15:37.930 --> 15:39.189
I don't get it.

15:39.266 --> 15:41.976
This is the sacred Mariner's Pearl.

15:42.053 --> 15:45.697
Where I come from,
this thing is priceless.

15:45.774 --> 15:48.275
Insanely fragile, but priceless.

15:48.352 --> 15:52.382
Wait! You gave me the shell
just to conceal stolen merch?

15:52.459 --> 15:54.966
- You used me!
- It's not like that!

15:55.043 --> 15:57.629
Or at least, it's not anymore.

15:57.742 --> 16:00.041
When we first met,
my play was to let you

16:00.118 --> 16:02.109
hang on to the pearl
to keep my hands clean.

16:02.186 --> 16:06.440
I had to lose those vodniks.
But then I fell for you.

16:06.585 --> 16:07.673
Hard.

16:07.853 --> 16:12.776
I fell for your good looks,
your ear sweat,

16:13.164 --> 16:14.920
your crab-greased hands.

16:17.064 --> 16:20.748
Seraphina.
You gotta straighten out your life.

16:20.825 --> 16:22.715
It's too late for me.

16:23.283 --> 16:26.058
Maybe not for us.

16:26.135 --> 16:29.495
What if we escaped together?

16:29.572 --> 16:32.408
- But my friends...
- Would want you to be happy.

16:32.485 --> 16:33.593
Wouldn't they?

16:33.670 --> 16:34.612
Mmm...

16:34.689 --> 16:36.298
They're in the cove!

16:36.375 --> 16:38.600
All right! I'm comin' with you.

16:38.677 --> 16:41.176
And you're comin' with me!

17:01.369 --> 17:03.244
No!

17:04.800 --> 17:07.160
Whew! Almost lost our new life.

17:07.875 --> 17:09.732
We've got to get outta this thing!

17:09.809 --> 17:11.715
It's no use! It won't break!

17:11.792 --> 17:13.301
None of us can get out!

17:13.378 --> 17:17.535
Hey!
When did you get all this hair?

17:17.775 --> 17:21.228
Give up the pearl
and surrender, Seraphina.

17:21.305 --> 17:23.984
And maybe we'll let you live.

17:24.061 --> 17:27.103
But not your dry-skinned land eel.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.516
Dry skin! Why, I oughta...

17:29.593 --> 17:31.759
He goes, I go!

17:31.836 --> 17:33.138
Suits us.

17:39.346 --> 17:41.273
Shorty, how did you get out?

17:41.350 --> 17:44.542
Uh, I dug a hole
lookin' for my walnut.

17:44.619 --> 17:47.392
Hole? I didn't see
any hole down here...

17:51.397 --> 17:52.963
Found it!

17:59.580 --> 18:01.789
Seraphina! Your song!

18:01.866 --> 18:04.161
Not really feeling musical
at the moment!

18:04.856 --> 18:06.216
Sing it now!

18:10.049 --> 18:11.480
Huh?

18:14.352 --> 18:16.358
Hold my hand! Tight!

18:30.295 --> 18:31.665
Hook Foot!

18:32.469 --> 18:33.852
Arrest them!

18:33.938 --> 18:35.496
Not so fast!

18:35.573 --> 18:37.963
Those are our friends!

18:38.040 --> 18:41.974
You... ... irritate me.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.801
Yeah, right back at ya.

18:46.878 --> 18:48.890
It'll take more
than a round, black paddle

18:48.967 --> 18:50.404
to defeat us!

18:50.481 --> 18:52.320
It's a frying pan.

18:53.489 --> 18:54.722
Aah!

18:55.823 --> 18:56.862
Yah!

18:59.135 --> 19:01.602
Eugene! Duck!

19:01.679 --> 19:03.308
Whoa!

19:08.100 --> 19:10.077
Yah... yah!

19:13.170 --> 19:15.408
Hiyah!

19:16.764 --> 19:20.854
Oh, I broke your jail.
Now what are you gonna do about it?

19:24.850 --> 19:26.017
Oops.

19:26.883 --> 19:28.427
You did that on purpose.

19:32.682 --> 19:35.035
Huh?

19:35.112 --> 19:37.966
Stay here!
I gotta help my friends!

19:45.937 --> 19:46.939
Hook Foot!

19:49.974 --> 19:51.270
Stop!

19:51.347 --> 19:53.075
You want it?

19:54.045 --> 19:55.856
What are you doing?

19:56.541 --> 20:00.780
I'll go in peace, if you leave
Hook Foot and his friends alone.

20:00.857 --> 20:04.645
Or else... goodbye pearl.

20:06.056 --> 20:08.129
No. Not the pearl.

20:10.295 --> 20:12.267
As you wish.

20:19.638 --> 20:20.991
I don't want you to go.

20:21.068 --> 20:23.700
Sorry, sugar, but I gotta.

20:26.289 --> 20:29.340
Here, somethin' to remember me by.

20:29.417 --> 20:32.788
Giving a hook to a fish, really?

20:33.924 --> 20:35.086
Kidding.

20:35.291 --> 20:36.921
I love it.

20:40.158 --> 20:41.791
Seraphina!

20:41.938 --> 20:43.275
Seraphina!

20:43.486 --> 20:45.418
Bye, good-lookin'.

20:59.447 --> 21:02.326
Well, I'm sorry
about how things worked out.

21:02.403 --> 21:03.471
Thanks.

21:04.650 --> 21:07.043
I guess I learned that sometimes...

21:07.354 --> 21:10.945
you gotta let the one
you love swim away.

21:20.502 --> 21:22.340
Mermaid tears.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.623
You know, Blondie,
I can see what you were saying.

21:44.700 --> 21:47.910
Sometimes, love just finds a way
of happening all on its own.

21:47.987 --> 21:51.663
And I guess sometimes
you do have to work at it.

21:52.724 --> 21:55.192
<i> Either way, love can be hard.</i>

21:55.269 --> 21:57.851
