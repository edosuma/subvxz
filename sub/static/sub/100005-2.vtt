the other two floors?

in the Garden, Stanley Cup.

37:03.595 --> 37:05.720

he never came back.

that night?

if I had.

upon ourselves.

accomplish?

-No, but if you're talkin'--

for choosing which cases

Hey, how are you? Jackie Rohr.

47:00.512 --> 47:02.929
My husband's not home.

47:02.929 --> 47:05.178
Actually, I'm here
to see you.

47:11.929 --> 47:14.428
Your husband is not
an easy read.

47:14.428 --> 47:16.178
He don't say a lot,
which is good,

47:16.178 --> 47:18.845
because I tend to talk too much,
but I can see that he's upset.

47:18.845 --> 47:21.261
This is not an accusation.
It's just a question.

47:21.261 --> 47:23.345
He would never tell me
something that was, you know,

47:23.345 --> 47:25.720
going on with the two of you.

47:25.720 --> 47:27.970
And you expect me to?

47:27.970 --> 47:30.887
I just want to be able
to help him, that's all.

47:31.887 --> 47:33.220
How's that?

47:33.220 --> 47:36.428
Well, I know that you both
have ideas

47:36.428 --> 47:38.220
about where he could go.

47:38.220 --> 47:40.261
So do I.

47:40.261 --> 47:42.136
And those are?

47:47.220 --> 47:49.595
Anywhere he wants.

47:49.595 --> 47:51.762
Mayor. Governor.

47:51.762 --> 47:53.595
You think that's
a possibility?

47:53.595 --> 47:55.387
Look, I got no reason
to bullshit you.

47:55.387 --> 47:56.970
If I didn't think there was
something in this for me,

47:56.970 --> 47:59.470
I wouldn't be sitting here
asking you for a favor.

47:59.470 --> 48:01.887
And what's that?

48:03.720 --> 48:05.887
Don't push him.

48:05.887 --> 48:07.637
You could tell me
to fuck right off right now,

48:07.637 --> 48:10.929
but your husband does not need
to be involved

48:10.929 --> 48:12.804
with this church shooting thing
in Roxbury.

48:12.804 --> 48:15.512
Black people, they're gonna
like him no matter what.

48:15.512 --> 48:17.220
He's like Sidney Poitier.

48:17.220 --> 48:18.762
They hear that song
"In the Heat of the Night"

48:18.762 --> 48:21.345

they see him coming.

48:21.345 --> 48:24.345
I don't care what some shit bum
Baptist has to say.

48:24.345 --> 48:27.845
What Decourcy needs
is for white people to trust him

48:27.845 --> 48:29.720
and the job that he's doing.

48:29.720 --> 48:31.220
Now, he manages to put away

48:31.220 --> 48:32.762
a couple of Charlestown
bank robbers...

48:32.762 --> 48:34.929
How is that going
to make them like him?

48:34.929 --> 48:37.470
Because it'll show
that he doesn't give a fuck.

48:37.470 --> 48:40.595
That he will do his job.

48:40.595 --> 48:42.679
That's what people
around here care about.

48:42.679 --> 48:44.845

48:44.845 --> 48:47.387
-I'm from around here.
-Mm-hmm.

48:47.387 --> 48:49.679
And you're a lawyer.

48:51.261 --> 48:52.804
So don't go acting like

48:52.804 --> 48:54.470

what I'm talking about.

49:02.095 --> 49:04.011
What are you,
paying rent here now or what?

49:04.011 --> 49:05.720

some yellow cheese

49:05.720 --> 49:07.303

of toast, huh?

49:07.303 --> 49:09.095
No, just like I didn't
begrudge you

49:09.095 --> 49:11.303

you lost gambling.

49:11.303 --> 49:12.637

-[Cathy] "Oh". "Oh"?

did I do?

49:25.303 --> 49:26.887
Nothing.

49:26.887 --> 49:28.261

of things

afford that, huh?

50:02.720 --> 50:05.095
So you gave him the money?

50:05.095 --> 50:07.178
You gave Tommy
the fucking money?

cause his fucking problems.
