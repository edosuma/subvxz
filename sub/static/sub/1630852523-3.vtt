WEBVTT

00:15.098 --> 00:16.266
Stay away!

00:17.142 --> 00:19.936
Stay away. COVID-relief people.

00:24.274 --> 00:25.275
What?

00:25.775 --> 00:26.609
You.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.697
I hate being trapped in the house
more than anything.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.284
All of us are paying the consequences
for Larray's actions,

00:34.367 --> 00:37.203
which I don't think was intentional,
but is still frustrating.

00:37.287 --> 00:40.498
Alex! Alex! Why are you in Connor's room?

00:40.582 --> 00:42.500
-I'm filming a video.
-Dude!

00:42.584 --> 00:47.047
I have stuff to do. I have things to film.
I am so stressed right now.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.548
I hate laying in bed and watching TV

00:48.631 --> 00:50.967
or staying in the house
not being able to leave.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.887
Now I have to, which is horrible.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.560
I haven't touched him
and I'm not going to. I'm five feet away.

01:00.643 --> 01:04.856
If I don't get to see my grandparents
and it's your fault, I'm gonna hate you.

01:04.939 --> 01:07.400
Our whole group
is stuck in the house together

01:07.484 --> 01:08.818
because of other people's actions.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.571
I was just calling you back.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.823
<i>I bought a snake.</i>

01:13.907 --> 01:16.534
Why? She bought a snake.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.995
Can you name him Larray?

01:19.079 --> 01:21.498
Like, he tested positive
before, correct?

01:21.581 --> 01:22.624
<i>He did,</i>

01:22.707 --> 01:25.502
<i>and they tried to blame me</i>
<i>for having him come to the party.</i>

01:25.585 --> 01:28.046
This little quarantine, it's just so hard

01:28.129 --> 01:31.800
because I'm out here running
a multimillion-dollar beauty business,

01:31.883 --> 01:35.136
and it's the two-year anniversary,
and I'm locked up in home.

01:35.220 --> 01:39.140
Whenever my personal relationships
turn awry,

01:39.224 --> 01:42.310
and all of a sudden
it becomes a problem with my business,

01:42.393 --> 01:45.146
that's when I do feel… angry.

01:46.898 --> 01:47.732
Hey, Larray.

01:47.816 --> 01:51.027
<i>Vinnie's telling everyone that</i>
<i>I gave him COVID when I tested positive.</i>

01:51.111 --> 01:53.071
You guys probably got it
at the same time.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.990
When do you get tested again?
Every, like, two days?

01:56.074 --> 01:56.908
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:56.991 --> 02:00.870
Well, hopefully, both of you guys
just get negative in the next week.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.914
<i>I'm gonna go watch </i>Euphoria.
<i>Love you.</i>

02:02.997 --> 02:05.041
All right. Love you too. Bye.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.796
How are you gonna get
a positive test back

02:09.879 --> 02:11.256
and then go to a party?

02:11.339 --> 02:13.800
I hate it.
Everyone thinks that he's so perfect.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.180
That's, why--
Like, how he's calling everyone.

02:33.111 --> 02:36.072
-Oh, shoot. This place looks lit.
-It's a nice place.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.240
-Cute.
-Hi, guys.

02:37.323 --> 02:38.324
-How's it going?
-Hi.

02:38.408 --> 02:41.035
Welcome to Starday Vintage.
If you need anything, let me know.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.203
Thank you.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.707
-They got guitars!
-Got a ton of stuff.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.750
I feel like getting a record player.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.296
How do record players work, bro?
How do they spin and--?

02:51.379 --> 02:54.340
There's little grooves
in the record,

02:54.424 --> 02:55.550
and it makes a sound.

02:56.134 --> 03:00.638
Are these what they wore back in, like,
the time of Abraham Lincoln and stuff?

03:01.139 --> 03:03.016
Thrift shopping's not for me.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.976
-How much is this Chanel bag?
-52.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.436
It's a fake from the '80s.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.854
I want a Chanel bag.

03:07.937 --> 03:11.691
Like, I know it's corny to say,
but I don't know how this is my life.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.363
I am so proud of myself.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.449
I feel like I'm gonna
wake up back in Compton

03:19.532 --> 03:21.367
and I'm gonna literally scream.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.036
'Cause this doesn't feel real.

03:23.119 --> 03:25.538
Even the people I'm friends with,
that doesn't feel real.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.710
There's no way
you're an actual human being.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.253
Gonna find some good shades.

03:39.636 --> 03:43.348
Get it. It's very… 21st century tampon.

03:45.850 --> 03:49.479
I need to go home.
I need a mimosa right now.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.397
Are you going to the dodgeball thing?

03:52.899 --> 03:54.525
-There's a dodgeball thing?
-Yeah.

03:54.609 --> 03:55.902
Everyone's going.

03:55.985 --> 03:56.945
Is Nikita going?

03:57.028 --> 03:58.655
Yeah. She's the one doing it.

03:58.738 --> 04:02.033
-Thank God. I'm gonna throw a ball at her.
-What's the beef?

04:02.116 --> 04:05.536
I don't know, I think she's mad at me.
I wanna fight that bitch in boxing.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.206
So you're beefing then.

04:08.289 --> 04:10.667
No. I just wanna fight that bitch.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.377
You guys should just make amends.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.837
You're telling me
like I'm not the one being ghosted.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.130
I've called her at least--

04:16.214 --> 04:18.967
-I don't know the beef. I'm curious.
-It's not beef.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.678
Nikita, I think
she's upset about something.

04:22.512 --> 04:23.930
I really don't know why.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.224
-What'd you do?
-I don't know.

04:26.307 --> 04:27.934
Nikita is an amazing friend.

04:28.017 --> 04:29.727
Fun fact: Before Hype House,

04:29.811 --> 04:33.815
she was the first
that put in effort to be my friend.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.192
But when she's mad at you,
she's mad at you.

04:36.276 --> 04:40.196
Like, if I was a pedestrian,
and I saw Miss Nikita driving,

04:40.280 --> 04:41.739
you know, it's a red light,

04:41.823 --> 04:44.492
which means she has to stop,
and I get to walk.

04:44.575 --> 04:45.827
Would I walk?

04:46.411 --> 04:48.955
I don't trust her. That bitch will hit me.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.499
Look, watch this, you call her right now,

04:51.582 --> 04:55.086
just FaceTime her and she'll answer.
Don't say you're with me, then I'll call.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.629
Don't put me in this mix.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.423
I'm not gonna say anything.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.216
<i>Hey!</i>

05:00.300 --> 05:01.718
Nikita.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.886
<i>-Why are you guys yelling at me?</i>
-It's Baron.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.848
-<i>What are you doing?</i>
-Just thrift shopping.

05:06.931 --> 05:10.518
<i>Why am I not--? I wanna be</i>
<i>with the cool boys. Can I be cool?</i>

05:10.601 --> 05:12.520
I'm just in my hungover fit.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.233
<i>Oy vey. Okay, bye.</i>

05:17.317 --> 05:18.276
Bye.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.742
I'm not kidding.
It's been like this for… a week.

05:25.825 --> 05:26.826
Have you texted her?

05:26.909 --> 05:29.954
Yeah, I go,
"Bitch, why are you doing this?"

05:30.038 --> 05:32.165
"How you gonna be mad
and not tell me why?"

05:32.248 --> 05:36.294
Nikita knows that my biggest pet peeve
is when people, like, ghost me

05:36.377 --> 05:39.088
without leaving the reasoning why.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.177
then why can't you let me know the issue?

05:44.260 --> 05:47.347
But instead you chose
not to talk to me at all, and then…

05:47.430 --> 05:48.348
left me in the dark.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.767
Make amends at dodgeball.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.269
-That's an awful time.
-Why awful time?

05:53.353 --> 05:54.562
I'm not gonna go over there

05:57.899 --> 06:00.985
-What?
-I say we get a bottle of '42, sit down.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.987
You guys can scrap it out if you need to.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.281
We all better
walk out of here with fedoras on.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.492
Ooh! The wiener-dog hat.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.869
-It's crazy.
-Yep. Don't be jealous.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.711
What house has two front doors?

06:18.795 --> 06:20.838
-The rich-people kind.
-Oh my God.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.674
-Should we just continuously knock?
-Yeah.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.510


06:26.094 --> 06:27.136
Little Huddy!

06:28.638 --> 06:30.098
You can't leave us waiting, man.

06:30.181 --> 06:33.017
-Oh, man. I was coming to the door.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.352
Hey, what's up, guys?

06:34.435 --> 06:36.104
Thank you, guys, for coming over.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.189
It's very-- Oh, a naked lady.

06:38.689 --> 06:40.858
Oh, yeah. No. No, she's got a blanket.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.735
Don't pan to that, you freak.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.366
-Nice.
-This is sick!

06:50.827 --> 06:53.287
Okay, I have to ask, with this…

06:54.038 --> 06:55.498
Is it comfy?

06:55.581 --> 06:59.585
I've sat on it, like,
once or twice, but it's not the worst.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.711
Oh, what?

07:01.337 --> 07:03.506
-It's kind of like…
-It's kind of nice.

07:03.589 --> 07:07.802
As luxurious as a rock can get…
kind of vibe, you know what I'm saying?

07:07.885 --> 07:10.388
-Oh my God!

07:10.471 --> 07:11.639
So, what's new?

07:11.722 --> 07:15.935
Well, I think we all know we have,
like, a kind of elephant in the room.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.980
-Okay, I get it. I gained weight…

07:19.063 --> 07:21.274
…but you don't need
to bring that up right now.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.316
Come on, Thomas.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.986
But look, we have a business,

07:25.069 --> 07:29.782
the Hype House,
that we were, like, partners in,

07:29.866 --> 07:33.411
but we've all kind of
transitioned into our own things,

07:33.494 --> 07:37.790
but it's kind of put that weight
of the business on my shoulders.

07:38.499 --> 07:41.586
We have this entity
that's making money every month.

07:41.669 --> 07:45.673
I don't think it's fair to say
that we're all equals in this.

07:45.756 --> 07:49.844
Okay, what exactly are you saying, though?
Because you're beating around the bush.

07:49.927 --> 07:53.598
When I've reached out
to you guys for help,

07:53.681 --> 07:56.142
you've picked up and did stuff.

07:56.225 --> 07:57.268
You haven't, really.

07:57.351 --> 08:00.396
We make $80,000 a month
and that goes towards the rent.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.066
Like, Alex, if I tell him
to shoot a Bang video, he'll do it.

08:04.150 --> 08:08.321
With you, you've been very busy with music
and you're not a TikTokker anymore.

08:08.404 --> 08:11.824
You don't wanna post Bang videos.
That's not your brand, I get it.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.494
But if that's all of our profit,
if you aren't helping,

08:14.577 --> 08:17.705
it's not fair to pay for,
like, this house.

08:19.165 --> 08:22.376
If Hype House goes under,
we don't have a business to make us rent.

08:22.460 --> 08:27.340
I wanna know if there's, like,
other ways I can help instead of TikTok.

08:27.423 --> 08:32.303
But I also like to lead kids to you guys.
Like, I have a good eye for people.

08:32.887 --> 08:36.349
He acts like it'd be difficult
to throw up a post with Ryland or Nick.

08:36.432 --> 08:38.976
It would take 30 seconds.
He's just too lazy to do it.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.938
It seems like Chase wants to reap
the benefits of the business

08:42.021 --> 08:44.440
without doing anything
to help us make any money.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.108
You either put in the work and help

08:46.192 --> 08:48.903
or you don't get to reap
any of the benefits anymore.

08:48.986 --> 08:51.155
Even on the business end,
I can help.

08:51.239 --> 08:56.911
It's just a matter of me and Alex,
like, meeting up each week, I think.

08:56.994 --> 08:57.995
Um…

08:58.079 --> 09:01.207
We've said that for months,
but it'll never happen.

09:02.875 --> 09:06.587
Chase and I have had this conversation
a hundred times. Nothing's changing.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.506
I can feel that he's distancing himself.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.758
He's screwed himself
out of a year of rent.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.094
Alright. Like, I'm ready.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.805
I have my financials under control.

09:15.888 --> 09:20.226
So let me get my own lease,
let me be my own landlord.

09:20.309 --> 09:23.813
Like, let me do it all myself,
and, like, learn, you know?

09:23.896 --> 09:26.190
I gotta do a little bit of adulting.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.128

What the fuck?

09:49.422 --> 09:50.923
Ollie. Come here, Ollie.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.134
-Vinnie, is that a stress grab 'em?
-Yes.

09:53.217 --> 09:54.635
Vin, what's wrong?

09:54.719 --> 09:56.721
I just hate everything. And everybody.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.681
-You just really pissed off?
-Yeah.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.809
Right now, I swear to God,
if one person says something off to me,

10:01.892 --> 10:03.185
it doesn't matter who it is,

10:03.269 --> 10:05.521
I'll punch you in the face
'cause I'm so mad right now.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.232
Welcome to what it's like
to live with ten people.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.695
He hates all of us.
We should all go hang out in his room.

10:20.036 --> 10:23.873
Meeting! Paper!
Calvin! Patty! House meeting!

10:23.956 --> 10:24.999
You guys have it.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.752
-
-Oh!

10:28.377 --> 10:29.211
Okay.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.546
Is this everybody?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.715
This is so sad.
How is this all the people?

10:32.798 --> 10:36.594
-Feel like we're missing people.
-Everyone else got too famous.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.262
I know, guys. I know.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.515
-Bro, Vinnie.
-Bro, you're still here.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.808
You're our last hope.

10:42.892 --> 10:47.438
First things first, with Chase being gone,
we really need to step up.

10:48.981 --> 10:52.777
I think Chase has moved on from Hype House
but I run a business.

10:52.860 --> 10:56.322
I've had entrepreneurship flowing
through my veins since I was a kid.

10:56.405 --> 10:59.116
I used
to walk to a middle school

10:59.200 --> 11:02.370
where I went with a lot of kids
that had money and I didn't,

11:02.453 --> 11:07.333
and I used to order headphones online
and up-charge them and sell them.

11:07.416 --> 11:10.961
Anything I could do to make a quick buck,
I've always been like that.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.839
You guys don't post. Why?

11:14.423 --> 11:16.384
Why are me and Michael the only two people

11:16.467 --> 11:19.053
that ever have posted
on the Hype House willingly?

11:19.136 --> 11:20.304
That's not true.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.472
It's pretty true.

11:21.555 --> 11:24.308
Every time I ask, even if I'm nice,
"Hey, you wanna film this?"

11:24.392 --> 11:26.560
Everyone's like, "No, I don't."
It's frustrating.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.979
The cool part
about the Hype House page

11:29.063 --> 11:32.650
is Kouvr and Vinnie could do a dance
no one would see on your pages,

11:32.733 --> 11:34.068
'cause it doesn't make sense,

11:34.151 --> 11:37.113
but it would be cool on Hype House,
'cause that's the whole point.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.699
We can post stuff
we wouldn't post on our normal pages.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.951
Or me and Thomas
can do a thirst trap together.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.370
Easy.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.287
Yes!

11:46.205 --> 11:50.418
I never had a desire
to be on social media at all.

11:50.501 --> 11:53.629
It just took off pretty rapidly
as soon as I started TikTok.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.840
I blew up because of…

11:55.923 --> 11:57.967
-thirst traps.
-What's a thirst trap?

11:58.718 --> 12:01.637
A thirst trap is basically, for me,
where you take your shirt off,

12:01.721 --> 12:03.013
sing the lyrics of a song…

12:04.515 --> 12:05.349
Thirst trap.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.727
A million followers.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.355
It is awkward for me to make them.
I don't even look at them.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.817
I don't want to see
my cringey self doing that.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.611
I might scroll the comments,
but they all ask questions.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.196
"Is he dating?"

12:19.280 --> 12:22.658
With female followers,
I've had a lot of creepy instances.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.369
There are gonna be crazy fans,
no matter what.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.622
Check me out. Check me out!

12:28.706 --> 12:29.915
Check me out.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.626
As I blew up on TikTok,
that translated to Twitch.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.086
Where am I going?

12:34.170 --> 12:35.546
I've always been into gaming.

12:35.629 --> 12:39.508
I started streaming my sophomore year
of high school in Seattle.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.010
How does streaming work?

12:41.093 --> 12:43.387
There's a difference
between streaming and playing.

12:43.471 --> 12:44.847
When you're streaming,

12:44.930 --> 12:47.933
it's something you can use
to interact with your community.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.185
Let's start up a deathmatch.

12:49.268 --> 12:52.480
Let me get one kill.
I need one kill. Oh my God!

12:52.563 --> 12:55.191
That's what set me apart,
especially at this house.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.443
What's the best way to do the Bang videos?

12:57.526 --> 12:59.195
We just have to do eight a month.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.572
-See, I didn't know that, so…
-No, I know.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.449
-Well, I also--
-If you let me know--

13:03.532 --> 13:05.701
I also don't like
to bombard you with stuff,

13:05.785 --> 13:09.413
because I feel like
you're used to people, like, using you.

13:10.372 --> 13:14.126
I know you're easygoing with that stuff,
but, still, I just, out of respect,

13:14.210 --> 13:16.003
I'd like to not be like that.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.797
It's fine.
Especially if it's for the house.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.131
-Then, yeah.
-I'll help.

13:19.215 --> 13:23.552
I have one thing-- If you guys see me,
like, being, like, mad or, like, stressed,

13:23.636 --> 13:26.430
just know I don't mean it,
I'm just really tired.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.058
It's just personal stuff, okay?

13:29.141 --> 13:30.351
-Is that normal?
-Huh?

13:30.434 --> 13:32.102
Are you normally mad like that?

13:32.186 --> 13:35.272
Yeah, like, if I get really mad,
that's what I'm like, but, like…

13:35.356 --> 13:36.190
So creepy.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.042
Hey, boy.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.794
-'Sup, shawty?
-What's up?

13:56.877 --> 13:59.630
We've got a skatepark
all to ourselves, Ryland.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.799
I know, it's low-key vibes.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.968
Ugh, skating is so hard!

14:07.888 --> 14:09.139
Yeah!

14:21.110 --> 14:24.280
Which one of the friends
that come over to our house all the time?

14:24.363 --> 14:25.698
Why choose one?

14:25.781 --> 14:27.992
-Go ahead.
-Who did you hang out with yesterday?

14:28.075 --> 14:31.328
I went thrift shopping with Vinnie, Chase…

14:31.829 --> 14:33.581
-Larray.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.083
-Larray was there.
-You set me up, huh?

14:36.584 --> 14:37.585
That's so funny.

14:37.668 --> 14:40.129
Larray said that you haven't
been replying to him at all.

14:40.713 --> 14:41.547
What's the beef?

14:41.630 --> 14:45.134
His manager tried to throw me
under the bus in order to save his client.

14:45.217 --> 14:49.805
I'm not gonna deal with my friend
blaming me for things that he did.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.099
I mean, it's not good to ghost a friend,

14:52.182 --> 14:55.269
but I just think I need my time to process
and not act on emotions.

14:55.352 --> 14:58.439
Like, I actively wanna try
to step in the other person's shoes

14:58.522 --> 15:00.524
and, like, try to see and understand

15:06.697 --> 15:10.534
Prior to going to Chase's house,
Larray had tested positive for COVID.

15:10.618 --> 15:15.789
His manager took it upon himself
to blame me for Larray being there.

15:15.873 --> 15:20.252
<i>What I'm being told is, apparently,</i>
<i>you might have got too intoxicated</i>

15:20.336 --> 15:23.589
<i>and, like, somehow forced Larray</i>
<i>to come to a party</i>

15:23.672 --> 15:25.758
<i>knowing he had COVID.</i>

15:25.841 --> 15:28.260
People literally
get canceled over this stuff.

15:28.344 --> 15:31.722
I was obviously so hurt,
'cause, like, you're gonna throw me

15:31.805 --> 15:35.392
and my business,
as Nikita Dragun, under the bus

15:35.476 --> 15:38.771
so that you don't get as bad backlash?

15:38.854 --> 15:42.399
I just am done being people's excuses
for their own actions.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.319
I support myself, I support my family,

15:45.402 --> 15:49.198
and I feel like one person
saying some hooly-dooly about me

15:53.285 --> 15:54.870
Yeah, 100%.

15:54.954 --> 15:59.333
Our group is, like, very close,
and Larray is, like, a part of that.

15:59.416 --> 16:02.962
There's not many people that you can
get along with like that in this town.

16:03.045 --> 16:03.963
That's true.

16:04.672 --> 16:07.132
And that's why I think
you're low-key so hurt about it.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.176
It's because you guys were that close,

16:09.259 --> 16:13.430
and, like, that's one of the last people
you ever expect doing anything like that.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.601
I'm just-- I've been hurt,
like, one too many times,

16:17.685 --> 16:20.938
and I think rather
than sit and cry about it,

16:21.021 --> 16:24.400
I just have to make some decisions,
you know?

16:24.483 --> 16:27.361
Know what I think?
You guys are gonna be good tomorrow.

16:27.444 --> 16:28.946
You just haven't seen each other.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.489
-When you see him--
-I can't hear you.

16:30.572 --> 16:33.200
-Don't skate away.
-I can't hear you. You're too far.

16:33.283 --> 16:36.745
-We'll go back to my house.
-Blah, blah, blah. Bye.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.581
-You guys will be best friends again.
-I can't even hear you.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.302
Beautiful.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.887
-How was that?
-That was so good.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.431
Best one yet, hands down.

16:55.514 --> 16:56.557
-Awesome.
-So good.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.642
-Bet. Let's do another one.
-Hit 'em hard.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.939
When you're a TikToker,
it's harder to transition into music.

17:04.023 --> 17:08.068
You don't have a cult following for music,
you have a following for who you are.

17:09.820 --> 17:12.448
For Chase, people look at him
as Lil Huddy, the eBoy.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.951
They look at him for him and Charli,
for him in the Hype House.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.996
It's easy to get
the 14-year-old girls to listen to music,

17:19.079 --> 17:21.832
but are people gonna come
to a concert of yours?

17:21.915 --> 17:23.834
Are you gonna bring guys to your audience?

17:23.917 --> 17:28.422
And the problem is that a lot of people
start music and quit TikTok,

17:28.505 --> 17:30.215
because they want to be an "artist,"

17:30.299 --> 17:33.260
but they don't understand
the only people watching are their fans,

17:33.343 --> 17:35.846
and when you abandon your fandom,
they'll abandon you.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.601
Woo!

17:40.684 --> 17:42.269
Come on, boys!

17:42.811 --> 17:44.146
Hell yeah.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.065
-Damn.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.276
Okay, let's sit down. Let's discuss.

17:49.359 --> 17:50.652
How bad was it?

17:50.736 --> 17:52.279
-How terrible are we?
-Tell me.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.865
-It's like a report card.
-You did pretty good.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.368
Um, you guys have any notes?

17:58.911 --> 18:02.164
I think it's just having more,
like, fun with each other.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.416
Like, in rehearsals,
it gets pretty serious,

18:04.500 --> 18:07.044
everybody's standing there,
not moving, focusing on parts.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.507
You don't actually need to sing.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.343
The coolest move
is to just go, "I can't hear you."

18:14.426 --> 18:15.677
-Point it out.
-Yeah.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.221
Oh my gosh. I'm nervous.

18:17.304 --> 18:18.806
What are you nervous about?

18:18.889 --> 18:20.307
I don't know what to expect.

18:20.390 --> 18:24.061
I have no idea what to expect
from anybody, from the fans.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.814
-Like, I gotta come strong.
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.482
I feel I have a lot of pressure on me.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.818
A lot of people want me succeed,

18:30.901 --> 18:33.112
but then there's a lot of people
that want me to fail.

18:33.195 --> 18:36.240
And so I can't let that happen.
You know what I mean?

18:36.740 --> 18:40.410
In the alternative, like, realm,
people can be a little judgmental,

18:40.494 --> 18:45.040
a little, like, weird about
an online personality in the music world.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.251
I put pressure on myself to be successful,

18:47.334 --> 18:51.797
because it's not just, like,
social media anymore.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.758
I'm in a different realm.
And I need to make it work.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.803
Be yourself, have fun,
and, outside of that,

18:57.886 --> 18:59.555
the crowd's gonna feed on that.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.516
And they'll see you laughing
and having fun with the guys.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.184
Like, you can't hate that.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.731
-We all do, man. All of us.
-It's the human condition, man.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.664
How--? How late is Nikita?
What time was dinner supposed to be at?

19:26.248 --> 19:27.291
Seven. It's eight.

19:27.374 --> 19:29.168
It's eight? We're late.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.086
-We're late.
-She's really late.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.338
-Can we get beverages?
-They don't have Diet Coke.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.591
I know. That's what I heard.
Why are we here?

19:35.674 --> 19:37.301
Call "Assistant Nick."

19:39.553 --> 19:42.556
Nikita! Oh my God.
Girl, you are on fire!

19:45.058 --> 19:47.060
I heard pictures leaked
of you kissing a guy.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.855
-Was it in Miami or something?
-No face, no case.

19:49.938 --> 19:52.691
What are the possibilities
of bringing me a Diet Coke?

19:52.774 --> 19:55.444
-Are you joking?
-I'm jo-- Dude, I'm kidding.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.446
-He was not kidding.
-He got called out.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.031
Oh my God. Hello?

19:59.114 --> 20:00.657
Well, well, well.

20:00.741 --> 20:01.950
Hey!

20:02.034 --> 20:03.285
Why are you underdressed?

20:03.368 --> 20:05.412
-Should I wear… less?

20:06.747 --> 20:07.748
Look how cute.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.249
Yes.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.877
-Miss.
-Hi. How are you?

20:11.960 --> 20:13.837
Well, thanks. What can I get you to drink?

20:13.921 --> 20:16.131
A shot of '42, immediately, if not sooner.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.885
-Straight or rocks?
-Straight. I got the rocks already, sir.

20:21.553 --> 20:24.556
-Wait, how much is a shot of '42?

20:24.640 --> 20:26.099
Out of your budget, buddy.

20:26.183 --> 20:32.481
You guys, we are gathered here today,
because I am celebrating my virginity.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.441
Yes! Let's go!

20:34.524 --> 20:35.901
Calvin is not the only virgin.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.903
-Yes!
-Oh my God.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.906
I really have to say,
thank you, guys, so much for being here.

20:40.989 --> 20:44.368
Today was
the second-year anniversary of my brand.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.495
-Well, congratulations.
-Cheers.

20:46.578 --> 20:49.122
Thanks. To two years of Dragun Beauty.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.332
Yes.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.210
I've worked
my whole life for this moment.

20:53.293 --> 20:56.713
To have this, like, beauty empire
that it's grown to be…

20:56.797 --> 21:00.050
My business is me,
and I support not only my family,

21:00.133 --> 21:02.344
I support countless employees,

21:02.427 --> 21:05.722
and one wrong move
can make everything crumble.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.182
In a second. In a second.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.393
What are the odds
Nikita would be in Hype House?

21:09.476 --> 21:11.103
I've been applying this whole time.

21:11.186 --> 21:12.729
Stop, you're already part of it.

21:12.813 --> 21:15.482
I'm gonna let go of the fact
that you let Vinnie ahead of me,

21:15.565 --> 21:18.860
'cause I'm like,
"Oh, right, he is the hot boy on TikTok."

21:19.361 --> 21:22.781
I don't know, dude.
Vinnie's been-- He just doesn't do much.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.366
He likes to sit in his room and--

21:24.449 --> 21:27.577
I'm like,
"Vinnie, what are you doing to help out?"

21:27.661 --> 21:29.955
He also brings an alternative audience
to Hype House.

21:30.038 --> 21:32.416
But he doesn't like making content.

21:32.499 --> 21:36.378
And if you also don't notice, 90%
of the most popular social media people

21:36.461 --> 21:38.422
don't wanna be social media people.

21:41.508 --> 21:44.386
The benefits of having Vinnie
in Hype House is self-explanatory.

21:44.469 --> 21:47.472
Boys and men love him
for the gaming side of it.

21:47.556 --> 21:51.059
And the girls really love watching
his content for how good-looking he is.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.269
He hates the attention.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.354
Vinnie's an 18-year-old who's like

21:54.438 --> 21:58.483
a nerd trapped in a hot, sexy,
summer boy's body.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.902
Should we make any scandals happen?

22:00.986 --> 22:03.697
Something scandalous?
What's something scandalous?

22:03.780 --> 22:06.658
Should we talk about Larray
having COVID and no decency

22:06.742 --> 22:08.744
and calling me every day
thinking I'm ignoring him,

22:08.827 --> 22:12.497
but I'm still mad because his manager
said he was going to the party

22:12.581 --> 22:14.458
to pick me up, 'cause I was so drunk?

22:15.542 --> 22:17.252
I've seen him do it to you before.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.921
Like, I love Larray.
I don't have any issues with him.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.298
But I've seen him do that to you.

22:21.381 --> 22:24.718
I think you guys are also a lot,
like, closer, and hang out a lot more.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.094
So those things come up.

22:30.265 --> 22:31.725
and let people in,

22:31.808 --> 22:35.479
like, it sucks when they
take advantage of you and stuff, you know?

22:36.229 --> 22:39.107
It happens every single time,
and I just--

22:40.859 --> 22:43.987
It just really hurt from him,
because I just never expected it.

22:44.071 --> 22:47.074
But you're a person,
and you put up this front of,

22:47.157 --> 22:51.495
"Oh, I'm such a bad bitch,"
but, like, you have your own problems.

22:51.578 --> 22:55.665
And you can open up to your friends.
Like, that's what this house is also for.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.752
If what Larray said about Nikita
had gotten out,

22:58.835 --> 23:01.505
that she was drunk
so he had to go pick her up,

23:05.092 --> 23:09.846
And once you get canceled as a person,
your brand is then canceled.

23:09.930 --> 23:14.017
So that really screws up someone's,
like, income and, like, life.

23:14.101 --> 23:17.646
I think something you should do,
that I've failed at doing,

23:17.729 --> 23:21.191
and has gotten me
to a very, very bad place,

23:21.274 --> 23:23.693
you should talk to people like Larray.

23:23.777 --> 23:27.364
Getting it off your chest
will make you feel so much better.

23:27.906 --> 23:30.325
Even if it doesn't end up
with you guys working it out

23:30.409 --> 23:34.121
or whatever, at least you were like,
"I did my part."

23:34.204 --> 23:36.998
Then maybe you can be like,
"Okay, I'm moving on from this."

23:41.294 --> 23:42.295
That was good!

23:43.463 --> 23:46.049
Also, I'm not a cute-- cute crier.

23:49.428 --> 23:53.140


23:56.393 --> 23:57.602
That's not that bad.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.729
You guys want to partake in something fun?

23:59.813 --> 24:02.315
-What are you doing?
-We are pranking Alex.

24:02.858 --> 24:06.027
We're bringing him outside,
blindfolding him,

24:06.111 --> 24:08.989
and putting stuff in a bag
to make him guess what it is.

24:09.072 --> 24:13.326
Is this, like, revenge for four years
of him using you guys in bits?

24:13.410 --> 24:15.704
I think Alex is gonna kill us
after we do this.

24:16.288 --> 24:20.208
All righty, Alex, me, and Patty are doing
a "What's in the Bag?" challenge.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.378
-So we have to blindfold you.
-I don't like this.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.464
I do this to you guys,
you don't do this to me.

24:33.263 --> 24:36.516
So we're doing "What's in the Bag?"
So this is gonna be your first item.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.062
-I don't know.
-Are you sure?

24:41.146 --> 24:42.105
Yeah.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.232
-Of your favorite fruits.
-Watermelon!

24:44.316 --> 24:47.486
All right. There you go.
That's a plate in front of you.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.030
Is that a mousetrap?

24:50.113 --> 24:53.074
-Maybe.
-You thought I'd fall for that?

25:00.624 --> 25:04.127
What is that? What is that?
Why do you have that?!

25:10.675 --> 25:12.677


25:17.474 --> 25:21.144
I think Alex is gonna get us back
for that prank we just pulled on him.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.312
No doubt.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.607
This is the prank
we should pull on Alex.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.193
Dude!

25:30.320 --> 25:31.613
-Come on.
-What?

25:32.864 --> 25:33.949
That was amazing!

25:37.369 --> 25:39.162
-That was a lot.
-Yeah. I know.

25:42.249 --> 25:43.500
Felt good getting you back.

25:46.461 --> 25:48.004
Real question's who's cleaning that up?

25:49.005 --> 25:52.217
Well-- Sorry, Alex.
Have a good one.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.385
Yeah. Later.

25:53.468 --> 25:54.469
Have fun!

26:01.017 --> 26:04.104


26:18.493 --> 26:19.452
Hello?

26:19.536 --> 26:21.371
<i>Hey, how are you feeling?</i>

26:21.871 --> 26:23.665
I feel kind of icky.

26:23.748 --> 26:26.334

<i>Chase, you have been working so hard,</i>

26:26.418 --> 26:29.129
<i>it's just a lot of stress</i>
<i>on your vocal cords,</i>

26:29.212 --> 26:30.589
<i>on your throat, on everything.</i>

26:30.672 --> 26:32.841
<i>So you're not contagious or anything,</i>

26:32.924 --> 26:36.344
<i>but your throat is just really irritated,</i>

26:36.428 --> 26:39.014
<i>and you don't want</i>
<i>to do any long-term damage.</i>

26:39.097 --> 26:44.144
<i>-So Dr. Nassiri wants you on vocal rest.</i>
-Yeah.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.731
<i>So to avoid any more irritation,</i>

26:47.814 --> 26:50.859
<i>they want to put you on vocal rest</i>
<i>for five days.</i>

26:54.696 --> 26:57.532
<i>Both!</i>
<i>And by the way, no whispering even.</i>

26:57.616 --> 27:00.660
<i>Whispering, apparently,</i>
<i>is even worse than talking.</i>

27:00.744 --> 27:05.040
<i>So you're gonna have</i>
<i>to communicate by paper and pen.</i>

27:05.123 --> 27:09.836
<i>This conversation we're having should be</i>
<i>your last conversation for five days.</i>

27:10.795 --> 27:14.132
Losing my voice
has put a lot of thoughts in my head.

27:14.716 --> 27:17.344
All I want to do is get out there
and perform for people.

27:17.427 --> 27:20.555
And if I'm out there
losing my voice every other week,

27:20.639 --> 27:23.725
it can't be able to…
to last the long haul.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.727
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>maybe it'll be kind of fun.</i>

27:27.937 --> 27:28.813
Okay.

27:28.897 --> 27:31.274
<i>Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

27:31.358 --> 27:32.817
All right. Bye, Erika.

27:32.901 --> 27:33.777
<i>Bye.</i>

27:34.235 --> 27:35.737
No talking.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.043
Good morning.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.300
"I can't talk."

27:59.219 --> 28:00.512
-Five days?
-Yeah.

28:00.595 --> 28:03.014
-Of no-- Without talking?
-Mm-hmm.

28:03.098 --> 28:05.016
We're gonna have
such good conversations.

28:08.603 --> 28:10.980
You said you need rent?
I couldn't hear you. What?

28:33.920 --> 28:34.838
Hi, boys.

28:39.384 --> 28:43.179
My biggest fear is being that girl
at, like, a gathering,

28:43.263 --> 28:46.975
and then you have issues with somebody,
and you say hi and they just keep walking.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.352
-Hi.
-How are you?

28:49.436 --> 28:50.895
Good. Hi!

28:51.646 --> 28:53.940
I'm still confused
as to why she's ignoring me

28:54.023 --> 28:58.445
and why she's giving me that, like,
uncomfortable vibe of, like, being petty.

28:59.028 --> 29:01.990
But I don't wanna fight. I hate fighting.

29:02.073 --> 29:04.159
And I hate conflict, and I hate arguing.

29:04.743 --> 29:05.827
Hey, Chase!

29:06.619 --> 29:08.329
Why are you being so quiet today?

29:10.206 --> 29:11.833
"I can't talk."

29:11.916 --> 29:14.127
What? Why does it look like death writing?

29:15.420 --> 29:16.755
Come on. Speak.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.089
Guys, I'm gonna talk for Chase.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.300
-That's what has this has gotten to.
-Okay.

29:20.383 --> 29:23.595
So how do you feel
about "The Eulogy" acoustic?

29:23.678 --> 29:25.930
-Shut up, Michael. You're a bitch.

29:26.014 --> 29:27.724
Oh my God, Chase!

29:27.807 --> 29:29.851
Chase, why would you do that?

29:49.496 --> 29:51.831
Wait, what?
That was supposed to go for Nikita.

29:51.915 --> 29:55.251
Larray! Come on!
Throw it as hard as you can, right now.

30:01.007 --> 30:03.760
Any chance I can get
to play with balls, I'm all in.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.768
Oh! Stop!

30:11.851 --> 30:13.144
Wait, stop!

30:16.105 --> 30:17.857
-I need to sit out.
-Nikita.

30:18.358 --> 30:19.609
Ugh…

30:21.027 --> 30:23.613
-Take a seat. Doctor's order!
-I'm playing basketball.

30:24.113 --> 30:25.073
Hey, bestie.

30:25.156 --> 30:26.533
Hey. It's been a second.

30:28.034 --> 30:29.202
Are we good?

30:29.828 --> 30:31.204
I don't know.

30:31.287 --> 30:33.289
If you want space,
you gotta social distance,

30:33.373 --> 30:34.958
'cause you not getting it from me.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.751
You wanna talk social distancing?

30:36.835 --> 30:39.546
Like that time you got caught up
at the party that I was at,

30:39.629 --> 30:42.882
but then your manager blamed me
for being at the party that you were at?

30:45.593 --> 30:49.097
I didn't know you were upset about that.
I didn't know and wasn't told about it.

30:49.722 --> 30:51.558
I didn't have anything to do with it.

30:51.641 --> 30:54.185
If I would have knew about it,
I would have stopped it.

30:54.269 --> 30:58.523
She heard a one-sided story.
Instead of talking to me about it first…

30:58.606 --> 31:01.234
You can't be upset at me
for something I didn't know about.

31:01.317 --> 31:05.822
If it was me, I would never
allow my team to talk about you.

31:05.905 --> 31:07.532
If you would have told me before,

31:07.615 --> 31:10.869
it wouldn't have been, you know,
an issue for that long.

31:10.952 --> 31:13.788
I was asking everybody in the room,
I was calling everybody.

31:13.872 --> 31:17.542
-You didn't talk to me for a week--
-How are you making this about yourself?

31:17.625 --> 31:19.085
-I'm not.
-You are.

31:19.168 --> 31:20.795
-I'm letting you know you are.
-How?

31:20.879 --> 31:24.215
All of a sudden,
it's me ghosting you that's the problem.

31:24.299 --> 31:27.135
-You did!
-We are friends outside of all this.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.386
We are real friends.

31:28.469 --> 31:31.431
You were the person that introduced me
to every single person here.

31:31.514 --> 31:34.642
So I hold the deepest loyalty to you.

31:34.726 --> 31:38.104
I didn't even know about TikTok
until you brought me into this world.

31:38.187 --> 31:39.230
I needed a second,

31:39.314 --> 31:43.651
but, like, don't sit here and spin it
as if I ghosting you was the problem.

31:43.735 --> 31:47.697
So, like, obviously Greg trying to save
my ass from not getting in trouble

31:51.367 --> 31:52.827
It wasn't your fault. It was mine.

31:55.496 --> 31:56.623
But I'm sorry.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.374
I appreciate that, and I accept it.

31:58.458 --> 32:01.210
I just don't want
to fight anymore. I love you.

32:02.921 --> 32:03.963
And I'm sorry.

32:04.464 --> 32:05.882
-Bitch.

32:06.841 --> 32:07.675
Bitch.

32:18.895 --> 32:22.148
and your walls become crazier,
and my dragon becomes bigger,

32:22.231 --> 32:25.234
and I never want
to show anyone the real side of myself.

32:25.318 --> 32:27.403
I'm an amazing friend.
I'd die for my friends.

32:27.487 --> 32:31.950
So her to say I threw her under the bus
really rubbed me the wrong way.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.953
I always have that voice in my head,
like, "Don't trust this person."

32:35.036 --> 32:37.830
"Don't let them know who you are.
They don't deserve it."

32:37.914 --> 32:40.708
And every single time I get eff'd over,
I'm not even mad at the person.

32:40.792 --> 32:41.834
I'm mad at myself.
