(pugs laughing)

01:07.500 --> 01:08.583
(sighs)

01:15.500 --> 01:18.458
Ah. There's the sign
I've been looking for.

01:19.625 --> 01:22.458
That place
has the freshest
vegetables around,

01:22.458 --> 01:25.333
and I want to go home
with as much as I can carry.

01:25.333 --> 01:27.333
(pugs barking)

01:32.291 --> 01:35.583
Now, that is
one fine-looking broccoli.
(laughs)

01:35.583 --> 01:38.000
(snorts)
Hi there, puppies!

01:38.000 --> 01:40.333
Hey, little piggy.
(snorts)

01:40.333 --> 01:42.583
(both snorting)

01:42.583 --> 01:44.208
(laughs)

01:44.208 --> 01:46.583
Hey, look, Bingo!
I can speak Pig!

01:46.583 --> 01:49.375
-(snorts)
-What are you doing
just lying around?

01:49.375 --> 01:52.750
We're waiting for Bob.
He's buying vegetables.

01:52.750 --> 01:56.333
Well, do you wanna come see
the most awesomest place here?

01:56.333 --> 01:57.875
What's the most awesomest
place here?

01:57.875 --> 01:59.625
(snorts)

01:59.625 --> 02:01.083
You wanna go in?

02:01.083 --> 02:04.625
I don't know.
We might get
pretty dirty, so...

02:04.625 --> 02:06.000
yeah!

02:06.000 --> 02:07.958
(all laughing)

02:10.625 --> 02:13.875
Bingo:
Look at me!
I'm a muck monster!

02:13.875 --> 02:15.083
(bubbling)

02:19.291 --> 02:23.250
-Rolly? Is that you?
-(snorts)

02:23.250 --> 02:24.583
You're such a mess!

02:24.583 --> 02:27.708
I can hardly
even tell it's you!

02:27.708 --> 02:29.750
-(pugs laughing)
-You guys play
in the mud so well,

02:29.750 --> 02:31.583
you could be pigs
just like me.

02:31.583 --> 02:33.708
I think my brother
would love to be a pig.

02:33.708 --> 02:36.333
-(snorts)
-(all laughing)

02:41.458 --> 02:42.583
Bingo:
Playing in mud is fun,

02:42.583 --> 02:45.291
but it can really wear
a puppy out.

02:45.291 --> 02:46.958
(Rolly yawns)

02:46.958 --> 02:49.083
That's why
after we pigs
get all muddy,

02:49.083 --> 02:52.083
we lie around
and soak up the sun.

02:52.083 --> 02:53.875
(yawns)

02:53.875 --> 02:56.250
-(Rolly snoring)
-I would love to be
a sun-soaker-upper.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.375
Bob:
There you are.

03:01.375 --> 03:04.500
Well, it sure
looks like you had fun
exploring the farm,

03:04.500 --> 03:06.333
you little muck monsters.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.583
I can hardly tell
which one of you is which.

03:08.583 --> 03:10.000
-(snoring)
-You know what?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.500
Let's get you home,
and get you all cleaned up.

03:17.708 --> 03:18.708
Meow?

03:20.458 --> 03:21.458
-(laughing)
-(snorting)

03:21.458 --> 03:22.958
-Huh?
-(Bob laughs)

03:22.958 --> 03:26.458
I know, Hissy.
These two are a mess!

03:26.458 --> 03:27.833
So, it's a good thing
I invented

03:27.833 --> 03:30.583
this dog washing machine
to wash 'em off.

03:30.583 --> 03:33.291
You guys can get
scrubbed clean inside,

03:33.291 --> 03:35.416
then when you come out,
ARF will go...

03:35.416 --> 03:37.500
(blows)

03:37.500 --> 03:38.875
and dry you off.

03:38.875 --> 03:42.875
ARF just loves to go...
(blows)

03:42.875 --> 03:45.750
And then you'll go... "Ah."

03:46.833 --> 03:49.458
(clunks, chugging)

03:49.458 --> 03:51.208
(toots)

03:51.208 --> 03:53.583
(bubbling)

03:53.583 --> 03:55.958
There you go.
By the time I get back

03:55.958 --> 03:58.291
from taking these vegetables
to some of my friends,

03:58.291 --> 04:00.958
you'll both
be clean and shiny.

04:03.250 --> 04:06.166
I guess I should go first,
so Rolly can keep pretending
to be a pig.

04:06.166 --> 04:07.708
(snorts)

04:10.291 --> 04:12.833
(Bingo laughing)

04:14.500 --> 04:15.708
This thing tickles.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.458
Ta-da!

04:23.458 --> 04:25.458
(blowing)

04:29.208 --> 04:30.958
Okay, next one in line!

04:30.958 --> 04:34.000
Let's go,
you muddy mudster.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.708
In with the dirty
and out with the clean.

04:36.708 --> 04:40.125
(bubbling, tooting, chugging)

04:41.291 --> 04:43.458
Yeah, you might
wanna leave him
in there extra long,

04:43.458 --> 04:45.500
since he was
extra piggy
when he went in.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.333
He loved
being piggy.

04:47.333 --> 04:49.708
Rolly's been going...
(snorts) all day.

04:52.708 --> 04:55.000
(gasps)
You're not Rolly!

04:55.000 --> 04:56.625
I never said I was.

04:56.625 --> 04:58.583
My name's Snout. (snorts)

04:58.583 --> 05:02.000
Oh no. Bob must've brought
that piglet home by mistake!

05:02.000 --> 05:04.125
Which means
that my little brother

05:04.125 --> 05:05.583
is still at the farm!

05:09.416 --> 05:11.291
-(splashes)
-Wake up, little piggies.

05:11.291 --> 05:12.500
It's time for lunch.

05:13.458 --> 05:15.750
I found this one
sleeping near a tree.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.583
-(yawns)
-I'm sure he's as hungry
as all of you.

05:18.583 --> 05:21.333
-Chow time!
-Rolly: Hey! Whoa! Watch it!

05:21.333 --> 05:22.750
What are you trying
to get to back there?

05:24.500 --> 05:27.208
(gasps)
Oh, there's lunch
back there.

05:27.208 --> 05:29.000
Eat up, little piggy.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.708
♪ Yummy, yummy, yummy ♪

05:30.708 --> 05:32.458
♪ I get to fill my tummy ♪

05:34.416 --> 05:36.125
Okay, time to pig out.

05:36.125 --> 05:37.958
(laughs)

05:37.958 --> 05:39.500
"Pig out."
That's a good one.

05:44.333 --> 05:45.625
What do we do
after lunch?

05:45.625 --> 05:49.416
We're gonna curl up
like we always do
and go back to sleep.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.458
Wait. Where's Bingo?

05:51.458 --> 05:53.000
I couldn't go to sleep
without my brother.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.250
We play
an "Are you asleep yet" game

05:55.250 --> 05:56.583
until one
of us doesn't answer,

05:56.583 --> 05:58.625
which is how we know
the other one is asleep.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.708
So, we're gonna
have to figure out
how to find my brother.

06:00.708 --> 06:02.958
These are
your brothers, silly.

06:02.958 --> 06:06.583
No, my brother's a dog,
just like I'm a dog.

06:06.583 --> 06:10.291
A dog who's starting to wonder
where his brother, the dog, is.

06:10.291 --> 06:12.958
That's so silly,
how you play pretend.

06:12.958 --> 06:15.875
And you're
as muddy as the rest
of these piglets

06:15.875 --> 06:18.583
and probably
just as tired,
so come on.

06:18.583 --> 06:20.833
(piglets oink)

06:22.708 --> 06:25.000
Close your eyes,
silly piglet.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
-(laughs)
-(piglets snoring)

06:31.625 --> 06:33.583
Bingo, where are you?

06:34.708 --> 06:37.458
I need to get Rolly home
before bedtime tonight.

06:37.458 --> 06:40.625
That little guy
won't be able to fall asleep
unless I'm with him.

06:40.625 --> 06:42.000
And I'll lie awake
all night,

06:42.000 --> 06:43.750
thinking about how
we're not together.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.708
(sniffles)
So, come on, Snout.

06:46.708 --> 06:48.708
You and I are going
on a mission.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.500
-(Snout laughing)
-Snout?

06:52.583 --> 06:55.708
Rolly's out there all alone,
and you're playing
in the mud?

06:55.708 --> 06:58.708
I can't help it!
It's mud-tastic!

06:58.708 --> 07:00.583
Come on! Now!

07:02.708 --> 07:05.625
Okay, I think
I might remember
the way to the farm

07:05.625 --> 07:09.583
from what I saw when
Rolly and I had our heads
out the window tilted like this.

07:09.583 --> 07:11.750
Except nothing
looks familiar.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.458
All it looks is tilty.

07:16.750 --> 07:21.625
-Snout, get out of that mud.
-Yeah, so I can go find
even more mud!

07:22.583 --> 07:23.708
Come back here!

07:24.708 --> 07:26.458
(woman humming)

07:28.000 --> 07:29.458
Hmm?

07:29.458 --> 07:32.875
Thanks for lunch, piggies,
but it's time for me to go.

07:32.875 --> 07:34.833
-(pigs snoring)
-(grunting)

07:39.708 --> 07:41.583
Finally!
Now I've gotta find Bingo

07:41.583 --> 07:43.708
and see if he's been
trying to find me.

07:49.875 --> 07:52.583
-Snout?
-(splashing)

07:52.583 --> 07:55.583
There you are.
You're harder to keep track of
than my own brother!

07:55.583 --> 07:57.083
-Whoa!
-(truck engine revving)

07:57.083 --> 07:58.583
Uh, what's happening?

07:59.625 --> 08:01.750
-Where are we going?
-I don't know.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.375
With my head tilted
like this,

08:03.375 --> 08:04.750
maybe I'll know it
when I see it.

08:09.625 --> 08:12.750
(grunts) That farm is
a nice place to visit,

08:12.750 --> 08:14.583
but I don't wanna live there
without Bingo.

08:14.583 --> 08:16.833
Whatcha doing
out of the pigpen,
little piggy?

08:16.833 --> 08:18.208
I'm looking
for my brother,

08:18.208 --> 08:19.708
and I'm not a piggy.
I'm a puppy.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.708
Come on, now.
It's time for you

08:21.708 --> 08:24.958
to go wee, wee, wee
all the way home.

08:24.958 --> 08:27.500
But, I wanna go wee, wee, wee
back to my brother!

08:33.250 --> 08:34.875
My goodness!

08:34.875 --> 08:37.708
You're not
a little piggy at all!

08:37.708 --> 08:39.000
You're a puppy!

08:39.000 --> 08:41.416
I know!
That's why I just said,
"I'm a puppy."

08:41.416 --> 08:43.750
Well, I don't wanna
keep you here on the farm

08:43.750 --> 08:45.875
if you got other places to go.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.375
The only place
I wanna go

08:47.375 --> 08:49.000
is the place
where Bingo is too.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.708
You must love
your brother a lot.

08:51.708 --> 08:55.458
I do, and now
I need to figure out
where to find him.

08:58.166 --> 09:02.083
Hey! This is starting
to look tilty... and familiar.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.083
Jumping giant vegetables!

09:04.083 --> 09:06.083
There's the sign
I've been looking for!

09:10.625 --> 09:12.166
That farm
has gotta be close by,

09:12.166 --> 09:14.875
which means
my brother is too! Rolly?

09:15.875 --> 09:19.250
Rolly! I thought
he'd be close by.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.708
-Rolly!
-Rolly: Bingo?

09:21.708 --> 09:23.708
That's him! Rolly?

09:23.708 --> 09:25.333
-Rolly: Bingo!
-Rolly!

09:26.333 --> 09:27.708
-Rolly?
-Rolly: Bingo!

09:27.708 --> 09:29.875
-Where are you?
-Rolly: Where are you?

09:29.875 --> 09:33.333
-(gasps) Bingo!
-Rolly!

09:33.333 --> 09:36.458
(slowed)
Bingo!

09:36.458 --> 09:39.708
(slowed)
Rolly!

09:39.708 --> 09:42.166
(slowed)
Bingo!

09:42.166 --> 09:44.000
-(both grunt)
-(bleats)

09:44.000 --> 09:46.833
(both laugh)

09:46.833 --> 09:48.583
I didn't know
if I'd ever see you again.

09:48.583 --> 09:51.416
I knew you'd come find me!

You're mud-welcome!

to her in her own language.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.250
(snorts)

11:19.000 --> 11:21.875
-Hey! What?
-Rolly: I'm back, Hissy!

11:21.875 --> 11:23.750
I'm back!
Did you miss me?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.958
Sure. Yeah.

11:28.291 --> 11:30.875
Are you sure you're not
that muddy little pig?

11:30.875 --> 11:32.875
-I'm pretty sure.
-Let's get washed off

11:32.875 --> 11:34.500
so Hissy can see
for herself.

11:36.208 --> 11:37.458
You want
to go through first?

11:37.458 --> 11:39.625
I wanna
go through together.

11:39.625 --> 11:42.583
(pugs laughing)

11:43.875 --> 11:44.958
(toots)

11:47.000 --> 11:49.416
A-A-A-A-ARF will make
the two wet doggies

11:49.416 --> 11:52.083
-dry doggies.
-I'm home!

11:52.083 --> 11:54.583
-Bob, you're back!
-Bob, I'm back!

11:55.583 --> 11:57.958
Wait! ARF did not make
you dry doggies.

11:57.958 --> 12:00.833
-(both barking)
-Oh! Hey!

12:00.833 --> 12:02.625
Hey! You two are soaked!

12:02.625 --> 12:04.875
And I'm getting soaked too!
(laughs)

12:04.875 --> 12:08.875
Oh, I love coming home
and knowing that you two
will always be right here,

12:08.875 --> 12:11.083
-together.
-I love that too.

12:11.083 --> 12:12.958
And I love it
just as much.

12:16.166 --> 12:17.875
(Rolly speaks)

12:17.875 --> 12:19.500
(growling)

12:21.000 --> 12:22.708
Is that Bob's newspaper?

12:22.708 --> 12:25.083
Where's my newspaper? Hmm.

12:25.083 --> 12:27.333
I wanted to read
today's news, but...

12:28.333 --> 12:31.208
Oh no! Rolly!

12:31.208 --> 12:33.083
That's my newspaper!

12:33.083 --> 12:36.458
Well, you've been chewing
on just about everything
lately, haven't you?

12:36.458 --> 12:37.750
You chewed
on my slipper.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.958
You chewed one of my books.

12:40.958 --> 12:45.000
You even chewed
on my favorite Captain Dog
action figure.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.083
I don't know
what I'm gonna do with you,
you chewy little chewer.

12:49.083 --> 12:50.000
(barks)

12:50.000 --> 12:52.708
I'll just lay
these pages out to dry

12:52.708 --> 12:54.458
before I leave
for work and--
(gasps)

12:54.458 --> 12:57.000
Oh no!
It says here that

12:57.000 --> 12:58.625
the Mona Lisa
is missing!

12:58.625 --> 13:01.750
-The Mona Who-sa is what?
-(mumbles)

13:01.750 --> 13:04.000
"The Mona Lisa,
which many people consider

13:04.000 --> 13:05.333
"the greatest painting
in the world,

13:05.333 --> 13:07.416
"was stolen and could've
been taken anywhere."

13:07.416 --> 13:11.000
(gasps) Oh, that's a double
big old shame.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.250
I hope somebody
finds that thing.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.875
-The Mona Lisa is one
of my favorite paintings ever.
-(door opens, closes)

13:16.875 --> 13:19.166
This Mona Lisa lady looks nice.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.958
I wonder if she's
a friend of Bob's?

13:20.958 --> 13:23.291
Yeah, that's probably why
he was so sad

13:23.291 --> 13:25.500
-that her picture
was stolen. (yelps)
-(news theme music playing)

13:27.583 --> 13:29.583
Rolly, stop chewing
on the remote.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.875

13:47.208 --> 13:49.208
Reporter:
The Great Wall of China,

13:49.208 --> 13:52.166
which many consider
to be the greatest wall
in the world,

13:52.166 --> 13:54.958
extends for thousands of miles
through the countryside.

13:54.958 --> 13:57.875
Bob said that the Mona Lisa
is the greatest painting
in the world.

13:57.875 --> 13:59.708
Think that means
somebody might've hung it

13:59.708 --> 14:01.166
on the greatest wall
in the world?

14:01.166 --> 14:02.583
That's where I'd hang it.

14:02.583 --> 14:04.166
Then let's go there
and find it!

14:04.166 --> 14:05.500
And then Bob
won't be sad!

14:07.000 --> 14:09.708
(sighs)
I love it when
they go on a mission.

14:09.708 --> 14:11.125

14:11.125 --> 14:13.000

too much? Take this stuff--

15:00.583 --> 15:02.291
It's pretty
far away, actually.

15:02.291 --> 15:04.083
I'm not sure how
we're gonna get there.

15:04.083 --> 15:05.750
Man:
Can you hurry
things up?

15:07.416 --> 15:09.250
I've got to get
to the airport.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.875
-Where you flying?
-China.

15:11.875 --> 15:14.125
Hey, this family's
going to China, too.

15:14.125 --> 15:16.750
Yeah.
(mumbling)

15:16.750 --> 15:19.833
Look at that.
They're all going right
where we need to go.

15:19.833 --> 15:21.000
Come on!

15:22.708 --> 15:24.291
Have fun in China!

15:24.291 --> 15:26.375
(screams)

15:26.375 --> 15:27.500
Hey!

15:29.125 --> 15:30.125
(engine starts)

15:38.166 --> 15:40.000
Hey! (grunts)

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
(groans)

15:42.000 --> 15:43.583
(screams) Oof.

15:43.583 --> 15:46.166
Uh-oh. Ah! Uh!

15:46.166 --> 15:48.208
(laughs)
Missed me!

15:48.208 --> 15:51.208
-(engine starts)
-Hissy: Where am I going now?

15:51.208 --> 15:54.625
Come on, Rolly!
You and I've got
a plane to catch.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.000
(light jazz music playing)

16:03.416 --> 16:06.708
Well, looks like you kids
are flying by yourselves,

16:06.708 --> 16:08.291
just like grownups, huh?

16:08.291 --> 16:09.875
Let me know
if you need any pillows.

16:09.875 --> 16:11.500
I can bring ya
a couple of softies.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.250
We won't be needing pillows,

16:14.250 --> 16:16.125
because we brought
some ourselves.

16:17.333 --> 16:19.166
Bob sure was smart
to put these things

16:19.166 --> 16:21.125
in our collars
for when we want to rest.

16:21.125 --> 16:23.958
Yup, so let's
enjoy the trip.

16:27.208 --> 16:29.625
(moaning)
I hate traveling.

16:31.750 --> 16:35.125
This wall is the perfect place
to hang that painting
of Bob's friend Mona.

16:35.125 --> 16:37.250
Yeah, we'll find it
here for sure.

16:38.875 --> 16:44.000
Boy! I didn't realize how long
the Great Wall of China was!

16:44.000 --> 16:45.875
It goes on forever.

16:45.875 --> 16:48.166
This wall is a lot longer
than I thought.

16:48.166 --> 16:51.208
And I don't see what
we're looking for anywhere.

16:51.208 --> 16:52.583
Are there any paintings
down there?

16:54.333 --> 16:55.375
Nope.

16:57.458 --> 16:59.250
And not there, either.

16:59.250 --> 17:02.375
Anyone seen a picture
of a lady? Anyone?

17:03.333 --> 17:05.708
Hmm. Where could
that painting be?

17:05.708 --> 17:08.583
(sinister music plays)

17:08.583 --> 17:10.208
(mumbles)

17:19.333 --> 17:20.625
China?

17:20.625 --> 17:22.958
I ended up in China?

17:22.958 --> 17:25.250
Bingo:
This Great Wall
is really long.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.291
Rolly:
Yeah, really, really long.

17:27.291 --> 17:29.583
But we gotta keep going
and find that painting for Bob.

17:29.583 --> 17:31.458
Bingo? Rolly!

17:31.458 --> 17:33.375
Hey! Wait for me!

17:34.875 --> 17:38.083
I didn't realize
there'd be so many people
on this Great Wall

17:38.083 --> 17:40.250
and so much stuff
happening all over it.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.416
Oh, look over there, Frank!

17:42.416 --> 17:44.125
It's a little parade!

17:44.125 --> 17:45.583
Oh, I love little parades.

17:45.583 --> 17:49.000
(dramatic music playing)

17:49.000 --> 17:50.291
Hey! It's a dragon puppet!

17:50.291 --> 17:52.625
(gasps) Ooh, I love
dragon puppets!

17:54.291 --> 17:58.166
Look at how those people make
that dragon seem all... (roars)

17:58.166 --> 18:00.208
as they move it around
on those sticks.

18:00.208 --> 18:02.291
The only thing I'm gonna do
with those sticks is go...

18:02.291 --> 18:03.708
(growls)

18:06.250 --> 18:07.250
all over 'em.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.208
Do you have to?

18:10.208 --> 18:11.458
Like, I said before--

18:11.458 --> 18:14.000
♪ A dog's gotta chew

18:14.000 --> 18:17.375

18:20.750 --> 18:22.458
(growling)

18:22.458 --> 18:25.166
You need to stop chewing
on these sticks, Rolly.

18:25.166 --> 18:26.875
You're chewing
on these sticks.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.250
Only to get you to stop!

18:28.250 --> 18:30.000
(grunts)

18:30.000 --> 18:33.375
Rolly, I know
a dog's gotta chew
what a dog's gotta chew,

18:33.375 --> 18:36.583
but we're on a mission
to find that painting
of Bob's friend Mona,

18:36.583 --> 18:39.000
so I need you to...
not chew.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.208
I can chew that--

18:40.208 --> 18:42.291
(giggles)
I mean do that.

18:42.291 --> 18:43.458
Good. Then let's go.

18:44.458 --> 18:47.166
(mumbles)

18:47.166 --> 18:49.166
(panting)

18:49.166 --> 18:52.250
I wish this Great Wall
was a not-so-long wall,

18:52.250 --> 18:55.125
so I didn't have to run
so far chasing those puppies!

18:55.125 --> 18:56.458
(sighs)

18:56.458 --> 18:59.458
I don't see
that painting anywhere.

18:59.458 --> 19:02.416
Me neither.
Let's hop up there
and take a look.

19:04.625 --> 19:06.250
-(rattling)
-You see anything?

19:07.250 --> 19:08.500
-Nope.
-(rattling continues)

19:08.500 --> 19:11.458
Except I see everything
starting to move past us.

19:11.458 --> 19:13.000
Uh-oh!

19:15.458 --> 19:17.375
Both: Yeah!

19:17.375 --> 19:20.833
Whoa! This thing moves fast,
like a roller coaster!

19:20.833 --> 19:24.583
Or a Rolly coaster.
(laughs)

19:24.583 --> 19:25.875
Both:
Yay!

19:29.458 --> 19:31.250
(both yell)

19:31.250 --> 19:33.583
This is
the greatest ride ever!

19:33.583 --> 19:35.458
On the greatest wall ever!

19:37.416 --> 19:38.708
Where'd they go?

19:38.708 --> 19:40.166
(both yell)

19:41.458 --> 19:43.500
(chuckles)
Hey, they're coming to me.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.000
Bingo! Rolly!

19:45.000 --> 19:47.500
Guys! Over here! Hey!

19:47.500 --> 19:50.208
Daddy, can I get
a waving kitty statue

19:50.208 --> 19:52.166
and have it sent
to our house?

19:52.166 --> 19:54.166
A waving what?
Hey! Wait!

19:55.166 --> 19:57.208
Thanks for the statue, Daddy.

19:57.208 --> 19:58.250
(cart rattling)

19:58.250 --> 20:00.625
This is a lo-oong ride.

20:00.625 --> 20:02.583
But, I think it's
about to be over!

20:02.583 --> 20:04.416
-Whoa!
-Rolly: Wee!

20:04.416 --> 20:05.416
Oh!

20:06.583 --> 20:09.458
-Whoa! Whoa!
-(both grunt)

20:09.458 --> 20:12.458
-Ooh, these are comfy.
-And well placed.

20:12.458 --> 20:14.375
Come on, Rolly.

20:14.375 --> 20:17.375
We need to keep
checking out this wall
until we find that painting.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.583
(gasps)
A stick.

20:22.583 --> 20:24.458
(angelic choir sings)

20:25.708 --> 20:28.833
No, Rolly.
Leave that stick alone.

20:30.208 --> 20:31.500
But, Bingo!

20:31.500 --> 20:34.333
♪ A dog's gotta chew

20:55.458 --> 20:56.583
What's it doing
in China?

20:56.583 --> 21:00.000

I would've
gotten away with it, too,

21:09.625 --> 21:11.291
if it hadn't been
for those meddling puppies.

21:11.291 --> 21:12.416
Look at that, Bingo!

21:12.416 --> 21:15.375
We found the painting
of Bob's friend
Mona Lisa.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.500
Bingo:
Yeah, but she's not
very happy about it.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.250
She's hardly
smiling at all.

21:19.250 --> 21:22.208
Yeah, Mona!
You should be smiling like this.

21:22.208 --> 21:24.458
Yeah, 'cause we're
both smiling like this.

21:24.458 --> 21:25.958
And dancing like this.

21:34.750 --> 21:36.458
(light jazz music playing)

21:36.458 --> 21:38.583
And how are
my two favorite
little travelers?

21:38.583 --> 21:40.583
Looks like
you're both all comfy.

21:40.583 --> 21:42.708
Here's something
to keep you busy
during the flight.

21:45.375 --> 21:46.875
(growling)

21:49.166 --> 21:51.375
(mumbles)
You going to tell me
to stop chewing on stuff?

21:51.375 --> 21:53.750
Hey, it was your chewing
that helped us find
that painting,

21:53.750 --> 21:56.083
so you can chew
on whatever you want.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.333
-I gotta chew!
-(music playing)

21:59.333 --> 22:01.833
♪ A dog's gotta chew
what a dog's gotta chew ♪

22:01.833 --> 22:04.583
♪ It's just something
Rolly's gotta do ♪

22:04.583 --> 22:07.083
♪ Everything we own's
all covered in drool ♪

22:07.083 --> 22:09.833
-♪ 'Cause a dog's gotta ♪
-Both: ♪ Chew what a dog's
gotta chew ♪

22:09.833 --> 22:12.708
♪ Chew, chew, chew,
chew, chew, chew, chew,
I gotta chew! ♪

22:14.083 --> 22:15.875
Man on radio:
The art community
is overjoyed today

22:15.875 --> 22:18.333
with the news
that the Mona Lisa
has been recovered...

22:18.333 --> 22:19.708
in China.

22:21.583 --> 22:22.583
(tires screech)

22:24.083 --> 22:25.458
(tires screech)

22:25.458 --> 22:26.958
Hmm.

22:26.958 --> 22:28.708
A package
for my neighbors.

22:28.708 --> 22:31.500
I'll keep it inside for them
till they get back from China.

22:36.958 --> 22:39.583
(both barking)

22:39.583 --> 22:42.083
Guys, did you hear
the news?

22:42.083 --> 22:44.583
They found
the Mona Lisa!

22:44.583 --> 22:47.500
(both barking)

22:47.500 --> 22:49.000
(whirring)

22:49.000 --> 22:50.458
Hissy:
Meow?

22:50.458 --> 22:52.875
-Hissy!
-ARF.

22:52.875 --> 22:55.083
I'd wave hello,
but I'm afraid

22:55.083 --> 22:57.458
I might get snatched up
and mailed somewhere else.

23:01.708 --> 23:03.625
The person
who stole that painting

23:03.625 --> 23:06.125
took it all the way
to the Great Wall of China!

23:06.125 --> 23:07.750
But now it's back
where it should be,

23:07.750 --> 23:10.458
thanks to whoever it was
that found it there.

23:13.625 --> 23:17.708
I'm just glad to know
the Mona Lisa 's right
where she belongs.

23:17.708 --> 23:20.208
Hmm. I wonder
what it would look like

23:20.208 --> 23:21.583
if the artist
who painted that

23:21.583 --> 23:23.708
painted a picture of us.

23:23.708 --> 23:24.750
It'd probably look great.

23:32.208 --> 23:33.583
(theme music
playing)

23:35.583 --> 23:36.708
(barking)

23:41.000 --> 23:42.083
(barking)

23:43.500 --> 23:46.000
(record
scratching)

23:51.750 --> 23:52.583
(barks)

23:56.583 --> 23:58.000
(barking)
