WEBVTT

01:50.724 --> 01:51.891
Where the hell is he?

01:53.516 --> 01:55.265
Line everyone up for a photo.

01:55.266 --> 01:56.349
Make sure our faces are visible.

01:58.558 --> 02:01.015
He's not here, what do we do?

02:01.016 --> 02:04.265
Don't be too obvious,
but play for some time.

02:04.266 --> 02:07.015
They're late for a meeting. You tell them.

02:07.016 --> 02:08.348
- He's here.
- Where?

02:12.433 --> 02:14.182
Of all the things to forget!

02:14.183 --> 02:15.016
I'm sorry.

02:19.849 --> 02:20.808
Here it is.

02:26.266 --> 02:28.641
Just open the door next time.

02:31.058 --> 02:31.933
Swama!

02:35.891 --> 02:39.098
This will go out in a
press release in Seoul,

02:39.099 --> 02:41.390
so make sure the flags are in the photo.

02:41.391 --> 02:43.348
And the university signboard!

02:43.349 --> 02:46.058
All right everyone, look at the camera!

02:47.224 --> 02:48.348
One...

02:48.349 --> 02:49.432
Two...

02:49.433 --> 02:51.016
Everybody, cheese!

03:12.433 --> 03:13.848
What are you doing?

03:13.849 --> 03:16.474
Go back to the line! Back to the line!

03:21.099 --> 03:22.473
Careful with that.

03:22.474 --> 03:25.058
What are you doing?
A present from my husband.

03:25.849 --> 03:27.473
- Take it away.
- It's a present from my husband.

03:27.474 --> 03:28.933
Let go of me! No!

04:00.849 --> 04:02.891
Where are they?

04:06.016 --> 04:07.183
Taxi!

04:08.183 --> 04:09.723
Taxi!

04:09.724 --> 04:11.098
They're not here yet?

04:11.099 --> 04:12.432
Welcome sir. Taxi?

04:12.433 --> 04:13.348
Back off.

04:13.349 --> 04:16.349
Taxi? Go fast! Taxi!

04:16.909 --> 04:18.116
You! Flight...

04:18.141 --> 04:19.641
Flight good? Good?

04:20.683 --> 04:22.515
Welcome Somali.

04:22.516 --> 04:24.932
Me! Best, best driver!

04:24.933 --> 04:26.599
Leave me alone, damn it!

04:53.724 --> 04:56.057
Hey! Taxi, sir!

04:56.058 --> 04:57.099
Come, come!

05:14.766 --> 05:19.265
Bruce Lee! I like! I like! Come, come!

05:19.266 --> 05:21.348
Come Bruce Lee! Come!

05:21.349 --> 05:22.765
Come!

05:22.766 --> 05:24.390
- Fine. Let's go.
- Come, Bruce Lee!

05:24.391 --> 05:25.683
- Come!
- Let's go!

05:39.974 --> 05:41.058
Oh my.

05:41.683 --> 05:43.182
Did you wait long?

05:43.183 --> 05:44.807
You came too, Ambassador?

05:44.808 --> 05:46.557
Welcome back, Counselor Kang.

05:46.558 --> 05:50.015
Let me get the smell of Seoul. Come here.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.933
It's been a year for you, right?

05:52.516 --> 05:53.558
Want a cigarette?

05:54.599 --> 05:57.265
I haven't had time to smoke even one today.

05:57.266 --> 06:00.974
The school event ran late, so now
we're heading to meet the President.

06:01.558 --> 06:03.516
The gifts for President Barre?

06:05.516 --> 06:07.223
You're opening it here?

06:07.224 --> 06:11.974
Need to know what they are
so I can explain it to him.

06:13.141 --> 06:16.641
Damn it, I told them to wrap them nicely.

06:18.266 --> 06:19.516
Wait, this is booze.

06:20.141 --> 06:22.808
Can we give this in a Muslim country?

06:24.099 --> 06:24.974
This here.

06:25.558 --> 06:28.349
It shows the Somali athletes marching in?

06:28.974 --> 06:29.932
What?

06:29.933 --> 06:33.140
I requested it since President Barre
missed the opening ceremony.

06:33.141 --> 06:34.141
You didn't check?

06:34.849 --> 06:36.973
I just brought it here...

06:36.974 --> 06:39.682
You should check these sort of things.

06:39.683 --> 06:41.682
That's not my job.

06:41.683 --> 06:44.015
With so few staff, we all need to pitch in.

06:44.016 --> 06:46.807
Then why didn't you check
with the Seoul office?

06:46.808 --> 06:48.390
I carried the damn thing back, and you...

06:48.391 --> 06:50.432
Watch your tone.

06:50.433 --> 06:52.724
Quiet! You two fighting again?

06:53.308 --> 06:54.599
We don't have time.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.558
Swama!

06:57.516 --> 07:01.348
We have to leave for the
Presidential Palace now.

07:01.349 --> 07:02.641
So you...

07:03.266 --> 07:04.433
Take a taxi, okay?

07:05.099 --> 07:06.141
Good work.

07:13.683 --> 07:14.683
Bruce Lee!

07:15.933 --> 07:16.766
Taxi?

07:17.766 --> 07:19.016
Let's go!

07:21.724 --> 07:22.890
Ambassador.

07:22.891 --> 07:24.724
At last, meeting the president!

07:25.599 --> 07:27.765
UN membership!

07:27.766 --> 07:29.223
A promotion!

07:29.224 --> 07:31.349
Now you're dreaming.

07:32.433 --> 07:35.932
The gifts in the trunk, is
there time to wrap them?

07:35.933 --> 07:38.723
Time isn't the problem.

07:38.724 --> 07:40.641
Where do we get them wrapped?

07:41.516 --> 07:46.682
That Counselor Kang, he
should've taken care of it.

07:46.683 --> 07:49.432
What more do you expect of the kid?

07:49.433 --> 07:51.848
He's obviously got a chip on his shoulder.

07:51.849 --> 07:52.765
You said it.

07:52.766 --> 07:56.387
Secretary, I know it's hard
working under a young officer,

07:56.933 --> 07:59.432
but don't make your feelings obvious.

07:59.433 --> 08:00.682
Sometimes it's really obvious.

08:00.683 --> 08:05.765
I'm happy to work with
you, so I have no complaints.

08:05.766 --> 08:09.476
But what's so great about
being an intelligence officer?

08:09.586 --> 08:11.573
He was sent here as a demotion.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.656
You think he likes it?

08:12.657 --> 08:14.824
Try to get along, for all our sakes.

08:26.782 --> 08:27.949
What's going on?

08:41.615 --> 08:44.280
I'm the South Korean ambassador!

08:44.282 --> 08:45.532
We are diplomats!

08:56.449 --> 08:58.281
No! You can't take that!

08:58.282 --> 09:00.489
It's for President Barre!

09:00.490 --> 09:03.615
You'll be in serious
trouble! Internationally!

09:18.782 --> 09:20.114
Swama.

09:20.115 --> 09:21.615
Are you okay?

09:22.532 --> 09:23.448
I'm okay.

09:23.449 --> 09:24.573
You're okay?

09:24.574 --> 09:27.698
- You okay, Ambassador Han?
- Yeah.

09:27.699 --> 09:31.448
You mind waiting here until help arrives?

09:31.449 --> 09:33.531
Yes, I can do it.

09:33.532 --> 09:34.949
I can do it.

09:37.449 --> 09:40.365
What do you plan on doing?

09:43.865 --> 09:46.615
What do you think? Getting
this meeting was so hard.

09:51.990 --> 09:53.240
Let's run.

09:54.865 --> 09:56.239
I said, run!

09:56.240 --> 09:57.365
Okay...

10:13.282 --> 10:14.615
Ambassador Han!

10:15.949 --> 10:17.864
Ambassador, wait!

10:17.865 --> 10:19.573
Wait!

10:19.574 --> 10:21.157
My blood sugar.

10:25.157 --> 10:27.573
Diabetes, high blood pressure...

10:27.574 --> 10:29.782
And they send you to
Africa for three years?

10:31.032 --> 10:33.448
Need a shot? Insulin?

10:33.449 --> 10:34.490
I'm okay.

10:35.157 --> 10:35.990
I'm...

10:37.907 --> 10:41.656
But we made the
appointment three months ago.

10:41.657 --> 10:43.114
Why is it canceled?

10:43.115 --> 10:44.698
Your Excellency,

10:44.699 --> 10:46.781
you are the ones that arrived late.

10:46.782 --> 10:49.739
President Barre had another
appointment, so he couldn't wait.

10:49.740 --> 10:50.699
No...

10:51.282 --> 10:54.865
We're 15 minutes late, and he had to leave?

10:55.657 --> 10:58.948
Did he plan to talk to
us for only 15 minutes?

10:58.949 --> 11:01.240
Sir, please calm down.

11:02.740 --> 11:03.990
Who the hell is that?

11:10.613 --> 11:12.570
Hey, Ambassador Rim!

11:12.571 --> 11:14.029
Are you playing tricks again?

11:14.030 --> 11:15.404
- Sir.
- Are you?

11:15.405 --> 11:16.988
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

11:18.571 --> 11:19.905
No...

11:21.238 --> 11:24.279
President Barre's next appointment

11:24.280 --> 11:25.821
is with North Korea?

12:55.238 --> 13:00.071
The flag bearer is the two-time
medalist in shooting, Bashinsky.

13:01.988 --> 13:03.113
Somalia!

13:06.571 --> 13:09.155
The Somali delegation is now entering.

13:14.196 --> 13:19.196
Getting their meeting
canceled was a pointless act.

13:20.530 --> 13:22.155
It was just for fun.

13:26.946 --> 13:28.487
Oh my gosh.

13:28.488 --> 13:30.196
Look at these bullet holes.

13:31.030 --> 13:33.905
They could've been killed.

13:37.030 --> 13:38.113
Swama.

13:39.196 --> 13:41.362
Don't you have to go to the hospital?

13:41.363 --> 13:43.237
It's okay.

13:43.238 --> 13:45.070
I put on medicine.

13:45.071 --> 13:46.113
Wait a sec.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.320
Swama, this is a radish and an onion.

13:54.321 --> 13:57.029
Radish, onion. Okay?

13:57.030 --> 13:57.988
Okay.

13:58.655 --> 14:00.446
Take home. Grind.

14:01.238 --> 14:04.071
- Mix flour, okay?
- Yes, yes.

14:04.613 --> 14:06.780
And you hurt...

14:07.821 --> 14:09.320
Put here.

14:09.321 --> 14:10.780
And sleep.

14:12.613 --> 14:14.696
Take this to your mother and brothers.

14:15.446 --> 14:16.362
Share.

14:16.363 --> 14:17.488
Thank you.

14:18.321 --> 14:21.779
So you just stood there and
let them take the briefcase?

14:21.780 --> 14:23.945
They shot at us with guns.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.030
Didn't you see the bullet holes?

14:27.946 --> 14:31.155
You think you could've stopped them?

14:32.238 --> 14:33.488
Secretary Gong,

14:35.238 --> 14:36.488
I'm a trained professional.

14:37.821 --> 14:39.529
You didn't even call the cops?

14:39.530 --> 14:41.155
No point.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.779
It was obviously the North Koreans.

14:43.780 --> 14:46.820
Of all the armed robberies
of diplomatic cars recently,

14:46.821 --> 14:48.862
has anyone ever left the
car and only taken a bag?

14:48.863 --> 14:50.654
Exactly.

14:50.655 --> 14:53.613
The timing of it, and then
their ambassador shows up.

14:55.405 --> 14:57.905
Must have been a leak.

14:59.071 --> 15:03.488
What, so there's a spy among our staff?

15:04.321 --> 15:05.155
What?

15:05.821 --> 15:07.321
You said there was a leak.

15:08.238 --> 15:10.071
How can you just blurt that out?

15:11.097 --> 15:15.679
Why blame the whole staff for
the intelligence department's failure?

15:15.680 --> 15:18.639
I'm the only intelligence officer here,

15:19.430 --> 15:21.180
so you're accusing me?

15:22.722 --> 15:26.305
When did I accuse you of leaking intel?

15:26.889 --> 15:28.555
What's with you two?

15:34.097 --> 15:36.888
Must be the Minister. What do we do?

15:36.889 --> 15:37.889
Do what? Answer it.

15:39.597 --> 15:40.804
And say what?

15:40.805 --> 15:43.263
You're not going to
report the failed meeting?

15:43.264 --> 15:45.054
Want me to buy us some time?

15:45.055 --> 15:46.597
What will that solve?

15:48.889 --> 15:49.889
Yes?

15:51.430 --> 15:54.972
Yes, Somalia Ambassador
Han Shin-sung speaking. Hello?

15:55.597 --> 15:57.721
I can't hear you well, sir.

15:57.722 --> 15:59.763
Minister?

15:59.764 --> 16:02.513
There's construction here.

16:02.514 --> 16:04.430
I think it's a problem with the line.

16:05.430 --> 16:08.513
Is it the generator? Did I lose you?

16:08.514 --> 16:12.680
Hello? Minister! I'll call back later!

16:21.139 --> 16:23.597
There are some advantages
to being in Africa after all.

16:29.889 --> 16:33.097
Secretary Gong, will you leave us?

16:33.722 --> 16:34.638
What?

16:34.639 --> 16:37.554
I've got something to
discuss with Counselor Kang.

16:37.555 --> 16:39.180
Oh, sure.

16:43.555 --> 16:45.847
- Get some rest.
- Yes, sir.

16:49.555 --> 16:54.514
Secretary Gong, he's more
diplomat than human sometimes.

16:57.014 --> 17:00.097
There's a reason he hasn't
been promoted at his age.

17:01.222 --> 17:02.930
No flexibility, that guy.

17:05.972 --> 17:10.887
He may be rude, but try to
understand him. We're all one family.

17:10.888 --> 17:15.012
I guess I have no choice,
since he's your little lapdog.

17:15.013 --> 17:18.305
Counselor Kang, what do you take me for?

17:19.847 --> 17:21.472
I can't believe you'd say that.

17:22.805 --> 17:25.137
Just 6 people in this embassy,

17:25.138 --> 17:27.888
and you're the only
one I can really talk to.

17:29.972 --> 17:33.013
I feel so bad making you feel that way...

17:33.014 --> 17:35.889
- There you go again.
- Breaks my heart, really.

17:37.805 --> 17:38.764
Ambassador.

17:39.889 --> 17:41.804
- This time...
- That's enough.

17:41.805 --> 17:43.804
Can you really give me your full support?

17:43.805 --> 17:46.264
Who would I give it to besides you?

18:27.930 --> 18:29.844
No, no.

18:38.398 --> 18:41.405
Your favorite Korean cigarettes!

18:41.430 --> 18:42.870
God, bloody hell.

18:46.662 --> 18:48.619
The rebels wanted to send out a message,

18:48.620 --> 18:52.162
so I just interviewed
their General Aidid and

18:53.162 --> 18:54.827
took some photographs of his guys.

18:54.828 --> 18:56.369
He just wanted to brag about how well

18:56.370 --> 18:58.162
they're adapting to
their training and all that.

18:58.870 --> 18:59.827
Really?

18:59.828 --> 19:02.828
What did the CIA or MI6 say?

19:03.745 --> 19:06.412
Well, they don't reckon they're
ready for civil war just yet.

19:08.037 --> 19:10.162
Very strange...

19:11.412 --> 19:14.828
If it's not war business,

19:15.412 --> 19:17.036
why...

19:17.037 --> 19:18.869
North Koreans sell weapons?

19:18.870 --> 19:21.537
Who? The North Koreans?

19:22.412 --> 19:27.119
This is a Type 68 assault
rifle, in production since 1968.

19:27.120 --> 19:32.369
This is a Type 78 AK-47
rifle modified for snipers.

19:32.370 --> 19:33.661
Made in North Korea.

19:33.662 --> 19:37.411
The reporter who took the photo
almost wet his pants when I told him.

19:37.412 --> 19:40.202
You're sure they're
really from North Korea?

19:40.203 --> 19:43.328
Does it matter? I'm not
the one writing the story.

19:45.995 --> 19:48.328
This is Africa. Africa...

19:54.203 --> 19:57.577
In a country where war
can break out at any time,

19:57.578 --> 20:00.995
selling weapons to rebels is
as hot an issue as they come.

20:01.662 --> 20:03.994
If that story runs,

20:03.995 --> 20:05.827
meet with the Somali foreign minister,

20:05.828 --> 20:08.327
threaten to cut off aid,

20:08.328 --> 20:12.036
and President Barre will have
no choice but to join our side.

20:12.037 --> 20:12.994
More than anything,

20:12.995 --> 20:16.869
get the Somalian
president's pledge to support

20:16.870 --> 20:19.703
South Korean membership in the UN.

20:22.745 --> 20:24.202
Good morning, Your Excellency.

20:24.203 --> 20:25.869
Good morning, Mr. Ambassador.

20:25.870 --> 20:27.120
Hello, Counselor.

20:40.203 --> 20:42.119
Thank you for coming this hour.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.161
My pleasure.

20:43.162 --> 20:45.161
Your Excellency, do you know that

20:45.162 --> 20:48.912
North Korea is arming the
rebels through Ethiopia?

20:50.078 --> 20:51.328
That's the latest rumor?

20:53.245 --> 20:55.619
The guns in this photo,

20:55.620 --> 20:57.995
you know they were
manufactured in North Korea?

21:01.203 --> 21:04.952
Last month, when a North
Korean delegation came

21:04.953 --> 21:08.119
and promised to support your government,

21:08.120 --> 21:12.662
they even visited the
arms factory here, right?

21:14.328 --> 21:15.912
But look...

21:17.078 --> 21:20.661
You request military aid from North Korea,

21:20.662 --> 21:22.995
then they support the rebels?

21:24.328 --> 21:25.662
That doesn't make sense.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.411
Ambassador Han, let's not get sidetracked

21:30.412 --> 21:34.327
on North Korea or the rebels or whatever.

21:34.328 --> 21:36.036
Just tell me what you want.

21:36.037 --> 21:39.577
North Korea has started lobbying
ministers in other departments,

21:39.578 --> 21:41.953
to block your efforts at
getting UN membership.

21:43.537 --> 21:44.912
But you know,

21:45.495 --> 21:48.327
I like the government of
South Korea more than anyone

21:48.578 --> 21:50.495
and consider you my very good friend.

21:51.628 --> 21:52.586
So I was thinking...

21:53.628 --> 21:57.169
The government of South Korea
needs to use their money more efficiently.

21:57.170 --> 21:59.710
For example, that program to
take five of our tech students

21:59.711 --> 22:01.252
to Korea to train them...

22:01.253 --> 22:04.460
Isn't that program
already getting good marks

22:04.461 --> 22:06.628
from both our governments?

22:08.170 --> 22:09.710
You'll have to bear with me, Ambassador.

22:09.711 --> 22:11.669
This is just an example.

22:11.670 --> 22:16.627
Now, two of my sons happen to be
studying industrial technology in the U.S.

22:16.628 --> 22:21.586
Let's say Seoul adds $25,000 for each,

22:22.586 --> 22:28.253
so $50,000 in total for their
aforementioned training fellowship.

22:30.920 --> 22:36.002
You want a $50,000
scholarship for your sons?

22:36.003 --> 22:39.044
President Barre may speak at the UN,

22:39.045 --> 22:42.877
but ask yourself who writes his speeches,

22:42.878 --> 22:45.003
and who steers his foreign policy?

22:53.795 --> 22:59.377
This so-called government is
just a pack of relatives and thugs.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.795
How can I do diplomacy with them?

23:03.920 --> 23:07.753
Counselor, does the KCIA
have any cash we can use?

23:09.253 --> 23:13.460
How can you ask me that?

23:13.461 --> 23:16.127
You blow the chance I gave
you, and now you want more?

23:16.128 --> 23:19.794
But the North Koreans are
lobbying, what can we do?

23:19.795 --> 23:21.628
If it takes cash to stop them, so be it.

23:23.961 --> 23:25.919
You know what that cash is for.

23:25.920 --> 23:28.961
You think you can just dip
into our operation funds?

23:30.295 --> 23:34.044
You keep forgetting what
kind of person you're talking to.

23:34.045 --> 23:36.378
What's with your tone?

23:37.086 --> 23:41.835
Look, wherever you came
from, I'm your boss here!

23:41.836 --> 23:43.628
Look at me when I'm talking!

23:44.461 --> 23:47.253
I think you've got other
things to worry about.

23:53.295 --> 23:56.585
Cheating on me right in the open.

23:56.586 --> 23:59.544
Hey! Hey, wait!

23:59.545 --> 24:01.461
Wait there!

24:02.170 --> 24:03.127
Wait!

24:03.128 --> 24:04.545
Is there really a leak?

24:05.253 --> 24:06.586
Ambassador Rim!

24:07.878 --> 24:09.128
Ambassador Rim.

24:10.586 --> 24:11.795
I want a word with you.

24:12.878 --> 24:14.253
What is it?

24:16.086 --> 24:18.252
Let's play by the rules.

24:18.253 --> 24:20.044
Ambassador Han.

24:20.045 --> 24:21.878
Maintain your dignity.

24:23.711 --> 24:26.294
How long will you keep up this sabotage?

24:26.295 --> 24:27.670
Sabotage?

24:29.878 --> 24:35.045
What about you, spreading
lies about us arming the rebels?

24:35.961 --> 24:37.960
Is lying your method of diplomacy?

24:37.961 --> 24:40.377
Why blame us for that?

24:40.378 --> 24:42.835
It's in the newspaper with photos and all.

24:42.836 --> 24:45.335
Just don't get caught selling
weapons in the first place.

24:45.336 --> 24:47.044
What is this bullshit?

24:47.045 --> 24:49.294
Hey, don't cross the line.

24:49.295 --> 24:51.794
We're just standing here,
you're the ones crossing the line.

24:51.795 --> 24:54.336
- I'll chop your head off.
- Not here, stop it.

24:57.586 --> 25:03.086
We were in Africa working
our tails off 20 years before you.

25:03.753 --> 25:06.545
You think these stunts
will get you anywhere?

25:08.155 --> 25:13.655
So quit selling out your compatriots
for the sake of the UN membership.

25:51.488 --> 25:52.853
What's going on?

25:52.878 --> 25:54.085
Rebels!

25:54.086 --> 25:56.127
They started a riot, and
now they're demanding

25:56.128 --> 25:58.794
that we release Islamic leaders
arrested by the government.

25:58.795 --> 26:00.003
Can we get out?

26:01.086 --> 26:02.753
No. Everything's on lockdown.

26:03.336 --> 26:04.335
But don't worry.

26:04.336 --> 26:06.128
Barre will take care of this in no time.

26:17.086 --> 26:18.420
Damn it!

26:27.920 --> 26:30.585
No instructions from Seoul yet?

26:30.586 --> 26:31.545
No.

26:32.836 --> 26:36.961
The Ambassador and Counselor
Kang are safe in a hotel, so don't worry.

26:37.961 --> 26:40.752
Try calling your family at home.

26:40.753 --> 26:42.460
What do I say?

26:42.461 --> 26:44.710
My daughter's studying
for her entrance exam.

26:44.711 --> 26:46.753
I shouldn't worry her.

26:50.045 --> 26:51.128
Ma'am?

26:52.795 --> 26:55.878
I was supposed to phone my kids today.

26:56.961 --> 26:59.378
Sure, go ahead, don't worry.

27:02.670 --> 27:04.460
But are they asleep now?

27:04.461 --> 27:06.460
Yes, they must be.

27:06.461 --> 27:09.169
The Ambassador will be back, no hurry.

27:09.170 --> 27:12.794
While we wait for him,

27:12.795 --> 27:15.211
shall we pray together?

27:17.920 --> 27:19.127
Shall we?

27:19.128 --> 27:24.377
Nearer my God,

27:24.378 --> 27:27.002
to Thee...

27:27.003 --> 27:28.752
She knows I'm Buddhist!

27:28.753 --> 27:29.960
You think I'm Christian?

27:29.961 --> 27:32.545
Just pray to Buddha in your heart.

27:35.753 --> 27:37.627
Amen.

27:37.628 --> 27:43.627
We pray for the safe return of
Deacon Han and Believer Kang.

27:43.628 --> 27:46.960
Let us begin with the Apostles' Creed.

27:46.961 --> 27:50.503
- I believe in God, the Father Almighty...
- I believe in God, the Father Almighty...

28:43.670 --> 28:45.003
Oh no!

28:47.086 --> 28:48.878
Isn't that our driver Swama?

28:50.128 --> 28:51.836
What's he doing here?

28:54.711 --> 28:55.836
Careful!

29:09.711 --> 29:10.545
Isn't this...

29:11.628 --> 29:12.878
the mark of the rebels?

29:14.128 --> 29:15.377
What?

29:15.378 --> 29:17.378
Then is he a rebel?

29:19.086 --> 29:23.335
Don't be ridiculous. It's just a scarf.

29:23.336 --> 29:27.169
Maybe someone gave
it to him for his wounds.

29:27.170 --> 29:28.795
But his neck is fine.

29:32.045 --> 29:35.836
What if he's really a rebel?
We need to send him away.

29:38.961 --> 29:40.420
He can't be a rebel.

29:42.420 --> 29:46.336
He's unconscious, how do we send him away?

29:47.295 --> 29:51.211
If we're not careful, we
could get hurt, Ma'am.

29:52.170 --> 29:54.085
How about calling the police?

29:54.086 --> 29:57.420
But if he's a real rebel,

29:58.461 --> 30:02.960
they might think we
aided the rebels all along.

30:02.961 --> 30:04.169
But we didn't!

30:04.170 --> 30:09.377
At home they turn innocent
students into Communist spies,

30:09.378 --> 30:12.378
you think that can't happen in Somalia?

30:15.378 --> 30:20.670
I'm just saying the political
system here isn't developed yet.

30:21.336 --> 30:24.627
Watch what you say, especially
in front of Counselor Kang.

30:24.628 --> 30:25.670
Okay.

30:29.961 --> 30:31.211
Who is it?

30:32.711 --> 30:34.127
It's the police.

30:34.128 --> 30:36.169
Listen. You can't...

30:36.170 --> 30:37.960
not come in here...

30:37.961 --> 30:41.502
Shouldn't we move Swama now just in case?

30:41.503 --> 30:43.044
Now?

30:43.045 --> 30:44.586
How can we carry him?

30:45.461 --> 30:47.586
Oh no! They're pushing in!

30:54.928 --> 30:56.635
What's going on?

30:56.636 --> 30:58.636
He is boss. Ambassador!

30:59.389 --> 31:00.847
It's the police.

31:01.431 --> 31:04.721
They say a demonstrator
is hiding in our embassy,

31:04.722 --> 31:06.180
and they want to come in.

31:06.181 --> 31:08.180
What kind of bullshit is that? Is it true?

31:08.181 --> 31:09.138
Well...

31:09.139 --> 31:11.347
Hey. Who's the boss?

31:12.561 --> 31:15.971
We're looking for one of the
instigators of the riots today,

31:15.972 --> 31:17.847
and we'd like your
cooperation in finding him.

31:19.264 --> 31:21.555
This is Korea government land.

31:21.556 --> 31:23.139
You can't. Never. This.

31:26.306 --> 31:29.264
Damn, I'm too worked up to talk!

31:30.168 --> 31:33.709
Secretary Gong, come
here and translate this.

31:33.710 --> 31:34.667
Okay.

31:34.668 --> 31:38.626
Your job during a riot is to
protect embassies like ours,

31:38.627 --> 31:41.627
and I don't see a single
one of you doing that!

31:43.502 --> 31:45.917
What? Can you repeat...

31:45.918 --> 31:47.460
Hey! You!

31:48.085 --> 31:49.126
Yes, you!

31:49.127 --> 31:52.626
You just trespassed on
South Korean territory.

31:52.627 --> 31:56.043
You want me to call the Chief of Police?

32:03.668 --> 32:04.752
ID.

32:07.710 --> 32:08.877
Stop it.

32:51.002 --> 32:52.585
You stupid asshole!

32:54.168 --> 32:56.292
- Sir?
- Yeah?

32:56.293 --> 32:57.667
Yes?

32:57.668 --> 32:58.584
What?

32:58.585 --> 33:00.209
Yes?

33:00.210 --> 33:01.335
What is it?

33:02.168 --> 33:05.626
I have something to tell you.

33:05.627 --> 33:06.543
Say it!

33:07.335 --> 33:08.710
- Honey!
- Are you crazy?

33:09.668 --> 33:13.293
What a circus. Did you let him in?

33:16.043 --> 33:17.418
Where's Swama?

33:19.035 --> 33:20.535
Where is he?

34:34.610 --> 34:37.243
- No more dictatorship!
- No more dictatorship!

34:37.244 --> 34:38.909
- Down with Barre!
- Down with Barre!

34:38.909 --> 34:41.034
- No more dictatorship!
- No more dictatorship!

34:41.034 --> 34:42.952
- Down with Barre!
- Down with Barre!

35:21.410 --> 35:26.368
I, General Aidid of the
United Somali Congress,

35:26.369 --> 35:28.618
address the embassies of each nation.

35:28.619 --> 35:29.826
One!

35:29.827 --> 35:33.534
The international support
given to Somalia in recent years

35:33.535 --> 35:38.826
has been used by Barre's government
to suppress civil rights, religion,

35:38.827 --> 35:41.701
and the democratization of Somalia.

35:41.702 --> 35:43.159
Two!

35:43.160 --> 35:47.909
We proclaim that our resistance
movement is for the purpose of

35:47.910 --> 35:51.993
toppling the immoral
and corrupt Barre regime.

35:51.994 --> 35:52.951
Three!

35:52.952 --> 35:57.118
Any foreign government or
organization that provides political,

35:57.119 --> 36:00.701
economic or military
assistance to the Barre regime

36:00.702 --> 36:04.368
is acting against the
national interests of Somalia.

36:04.369 --> 36:09.076
Therefore, your government's decision
whether to support the Barre regime,

36:09.077 --> 36:11.951
or to support the people of Somalia

36:11.952 --> 36:15.201
will determine whether
you are friend or foe.

36:15.202 --> 36:18.451
Wait, do we know for sure this is real?

36:18.452 --> 36:21.118
I'll go talk to the guys
at the U.S. Embassy.

36:21.119 --> 36:22.243
The...

36:22.244 --> 36:23.534
Okay...

36:23.535 --> 36:24.494
See you.

36:26.053 --> 36:31.136
Things often get stormy in
this region, so don't panic.

36:32.428 --> 36:35.553
The radio! Let's listen to the news.

36:41.970 --> 36:44.427
- Down with dictatorship!
- Down with dictatorship!

36:44.428 --> 36:45.969
- Drive out Barre!
- Drive out Barre!

36:45.970 --> 36:49.719
Without any Koreans to
look after, can't we pull out?

36:49.720 --> 36:52.095
Public servants can't act without an order.

36:52.678 --> 36:54.135
The CIA says it'll be fine.

36:54.136 --> 36:56.677
Should we believe everything they say?

36:56.678 --> 36:59.970
This is hardly the first time
they've predicted war here.

37:02.595 --> 37:03.511
Think of Korea.

37:04.178 --> 37:05.302
Every day they predict war.

37:05.303 --> 37:08.885
At least in Korea, we know
what info is real or fake.

37:08.886 --> 37:11.928
Over here, can we be sure of anything?

37:18.261 --> 37:19.345
Honey.

37:20.136 --> 37:23.386
Don't stay here. You go back to Seoul.

37:23.970 --> 37:25.135
And you?

37:25.136 --> 37:27.052
It took me 28 years to get here.

37:27.053 --> 37:28.719
Should I ruin it all with a month left?

37:28.720 --> 37:31.345
They can't demote you for escaping danger.

37:33.246 --> 37:34.495
We spent three years here

37:34.496 --> 37:37.329
during the most important
stage of our daughter's schooling!

37:37.330 --> 37:38.580
What is this?

37:39.288 --> 37:42.704
My report went to Seoul
today, so they'll do something.

37:42.705 --> 37:47.024
So I should leave you
and all the staff behind?

37:47.049 --> 37:49.913
You're a family member,
not a public servant.

37:51.970 --> 37:55.261
I'm calling the travel agent
tomorrow, so get ready.

38:22.386 --> 38:23.928
It's mine!

38:30.803 --> 38:31.678
Take everything!

38:32.970 --> 38:34.345
ID!

38:49.970 --> 38:53.135
The travel agency's closed. No one's there.

38:53.136 --> 38:55.385
We need to find a broker for a ticket.

38:55.386 --> 38:56.594
Did you get cash?

38:56.595 --> 38:59.803
All the banks and offices are closed!

39:07.761 --> 39:09.177
We need to get dollars!

39:09.178 --> 39:11.094
Even the government ministers ran away,

39:11.095 --> 39:12.845
There's nothing we can do!

39:16.136 --> 39:17.886
Let's go back to the embassy.

39:20.261 --> 39:22.260
- Down with dictatorship! Drive out Barre!
- Down with dictatorship! Drive out Barre!

39:22.261 --> 39:24.636
- Down with dictatorship! Drive out Barre!
- Down with dictatorship! Drive out Barre!

39:54.011 --> 39:54.927
Honey!

39:54.928 --> 39:55.844
Duck!

39:55.845 --> 39:56.761
On the floor!

39:57.720 --> 40:02.011
Burn any document connected
to the Somali government!

40:04.136 --> 40:05.678
Hurry up!

40:10.470 --> 40:12.303
TOP SECRET

40:17.595 --> 40:20.010
Oh no!

40:20.011 --> 40:21.428
Out of the way!

40:23.636 --> 40:24.927
What is this?

40:24.928 --> 40:26.594
All connections are cut!

40:26.595 --> 40:28.385
What? Even telex?

40:28.386 --> 40:29.553
Telex, too.

40:31.970 --> 40:33.552
We have the tape from
the community function!

40:33.553 --> 40:35.135
- What?
- Play it!

40:35.136 --> 40:36.094
Okay.

40:36.095 --> 40:37.720
Secretary Gong! The tape...

40:46.011 --> 40:47.345
Connect the line!

40:55.095 --> 40:58.261
Shit, why aren't you playing it?

41:08.386 --> 41:11.219
Assalamu alaikum!

41:11.220 --> 41:13.385
Hello everyone!

41:13.386 --> 41:19.303
We have come from far-off
South Korea to be your friends.

41:28.582 --> 41:31.541
For the sake of Somalia's
development and prosperity,

41:34.457 --> 41:40.499
we promise to become
good friends as one family.

41:50.041 --> 41:51.666
Family members like friends,

41:54.291 --> 41:56.166
friends like family members...

42:00.041 --> 42:02.874
Remember that in good times or bad,

42:08.291 --> 42:14.791
we South Koreans will
always stand by your side!

42:43.175 --> 42:45.009
The rebels have taken the radio station?

42:46.134 --> 42:49.259
It's a different frequency.

42:52.300 --> 42:54.009
It's a civilian uprising.

42:54.925 --> 42:58.259
Rebel forces haven't arrived
yet, so it's not a state of war.

43:00.425 --> 43:01.549
You need to keep calm.

43:01.550 --> 43:04.383
The rebels are calling for the
president's head on the radio,

43:04.384 --> 43:05.759
and I should keep calm?

43:07.259 --> 43:09.467
Do we have any kind of intel at all?

43:12.842 --> 43:14.342
The people in Seoul...

43:15.384 --> 43:18.634
don't even know what's
happening to us, right?

43:21.342 --> 43:22.675
We're isolated here.

43:24.384 --> 43:25.509
Why...

43:28.381 --> 43:31.213
Why do I have to die in a foreign country?

43:31.214 --> 43:32.630
You're not going to die!

43:32.631 --> 43:34.797
Hey!

43:34.798 --> 43:37.089
Let's take one thing at a time.

43:39.048 --> 43:41.256
Sir, we need to request protection.

43:41.923 --> 43:45.548
You said the ministers
ran off. Who do we ask?

44:01.631 --> 44:02.630
Stop!

44:02.631 --> 44:04.339
- Counselor Kang! Stop...
- I saw it.

44:07.673 --> 44:08.839
Who do we have here?

44:09.464 --> 44:11.839
If it isn't the scary Korean diplomat.

44:13.839 --> 44:16.213
Assalamu alaikum!

44:16.214 --> 44:17.673
What brings you here at this hour?

44:19.881 --> 44:21.214
With a date, no less.

44:21.839 --> 44:24.631
- I want to meet Chief.
- You have an appointment?

44:26.006 --> 44:28.713
Our phone all died.

44:28.714 --> 44:30.213
Well, that's too bad then.

44:30.214 --> 44:31.423
Because the chief is busy.

44:33.756 --> 44:34.838
How about deputy chief?

44:34.839 --> 44:36.131
Busy.

44:37.339 --> 44:38.798
In that case...

44:39.673 --> 44:41.963
I will see the...

44:41.964 --> 44:43.880
What's the English for "haengjungkwan"?

44:43.881 --> 44:45.255
Administrator.

44:45.256 --> 44:47.338
I will see the administrator.

44:47.339 --> 44:48.714
Nope. Busy.

44:50.548 --> 44:53.005
And since this is a state
of national emergency,

44:53.006 --> 44:54.839
diplomatic privileges don't apply.

44:56.964 --> 44:58.256
You have no authority!

45:07.714 --> 45:09.547
I am a trained man.

45:09.548 --> 45:12.714
You're also in Somali
government jurisdiction.

45:13.673 --> 45:15.338
My jurisdiction!

45:15.339 --> 45:17.006
So you don't call the shots here.

45:18.131 --> 45:19.380
Now,

45:19.381 --> 45:20.714
go back.

45:29.839 --> 45:31.672
Translate what I'm about to say.

45:31.673 --> 45:32.506
What?

45:36.548 --> 45:39.005
Arrest me! Shit, arrest me!

45:39.006 --> 45:41.088
I'm a South Korean Counselor!

45:41.089 --> 45:43.797
I've come to deliver an
official embassy message!

45:43.798 --> 45:45.755
I'm a South Korean Counselor!

45:45.756 --> 45:48.506
I've come to deliver an
official embassy message!

45:49.548 --> 45:50.673
You got a death wish?

45:51.881 --> 45:53.713
Go ahead and shoot, asshole!

45:53.714 --> 45:56.505
Shoot me if you can!

45:56.506 --> 45:58.838
Translate for me!

45:58.839 --> 46:01.964
Your commissioner is
watching. Deliver this message.

46:04.048 --> 46:07.756
Your commissioner's name is
on our embassy's contact list.

46:11.548 --> 46:14.755
If the rebels take our embassy, we
won't be the only ones going down.

46:14.756 --> 46:16.630
You want to get your family out, right?

46:16.631 --> 46:19.963
Somali money is as good as toilet paper.
And I bet you don't have enough dollars.

46:19.964 --> 46:25.297
So take our cash, and
send us police protection.

46:25.298 --> 46:26.446
Okay?

47:42.464 --> 47:44.130
- He's a policeman!
- No!

47:44.131 --> 47:46.065
He killed Swama!

47:46.423 --> 47:47.589
I'm not a policeman!

47:49.298 --> 47:52.547
Punish the murderer!

47:52.548 --> 47:54.881
It's not me!

48:01.923 --> 48:04.149
I'm on your side!

48:08.881 --> 48:09.904
Please!

48:23.449 --> 48:27.366
All these people came here
to get on the evacuation plane.

48:28.116 --> 48:31.698
Even if you are diplomats, we
can't let you board an aircraft

48:31.699 --> 48:33.865
unless it's been sent by your government.

48:33.866 --> 48:37.115
We have no way of
contacting our government.

48:37.116 --> 48:39.616
All our communications are down.

48:40.408 --> 48:42.157
That's your problem.

48:42.158 --> 48:43.824
We have no choice.

48:44.785 --> 48:46.534
I know...

48:46.535 --> 48:49.994
But that plane. From
Nairobi Airport, right?

48:51.869 --> 48:55.243
There tower... Contact Nairobi Tower can...

48:55.244 --> 48:57.284
What is it? Just tell me.

48:57.285 --> 48:58.785
The control tower!

48:59.702 --> 49:04.119
Can you try to contact the
Korean Embassy in Kenya with it?

49:04.702 --> 49:05.869
I'm sorry.

49:16.660 --> 49:19.368
We're North Korean
diplomats. Who's in charge here?

49:19.369 --> 49:21.076
We need to get to the airport.

49:21.077 --> 49:23.159
You can't go to the airport. Turn back.

49:23.160 --> 49:26.659
Travel restrictions will soon
be enforced for all of Mogadishu.

49:26.660 --> 49:27.826
Travel restrictions?

49:27.827 --> 49:30.202
Then the airport will be closed too?

49:31.410 --> 49:36.118
Since the rebel troops entered
Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia,

49:36.119 --> 49:38.326
the gunfights between the Somali government

49:38.327 --> 49:39.909
military forces and the rebels

49:39.910 --> 49:43.909
have been taking place
every day throughout the city.

49:43.910 --> 49:46.326
The future of the country is now bleak.

49:46.327 --> 49:49.493
And the security of all
foreigners in Somalia...

49:49.494 --> 49:51.784
We have no electricity,
water or communications,

49:51.785 --> 49:53.244
and no gas for the generator.

49:54.744 --> 49:58.368
And the defense chief who issues
travel passes has fled the city.

49:58.369 --> 50:00.035
Don't worry.

50:00.827 --> 50:03.993
His nephew is still selling passes.

50:03.994 --> 50:05.993
Our informants have gone to get them.

50:05.994 --> 50:09.076
Our bigger problem is we have no food.

50:09.077 --> 50:11.369
I told you to secure food!

50:12.410 --> 50:16.409
No matter how much cash we offer,
no one has enough even for themselves.

50:16.410 --> 50:17.452
What should I do?

50:18.660 --> 50:19.827
Turn off the light!

50:25.827 --> 50:27.369
Here they are.

50:28.244 --> 50:29.744
Rest easy and turn the lights on.

50:31.452 --> 50:33.660
It's the informants I
sent to buy travel passes.

50:34.244 --> 50:35.577
Get ready to leave.

50:40.994 --> 50:43.409
There are rebels nearby.
Can we talk inside?

50:43.410 --> 50:44.577
Come on.

50:47.494 --> 50:48.702
We'll talk inside...

50:51.452 --> 50:52.952
You son of a bitch!

51:40.619 --> 51:44.702
Watch! Money!

51:45.494 --> 51:46.785
Min-seo!

51:58.285 --> 51:59.202
Hey!

52:18.410 --> 52:20.535
Stop!

52:24.675 --> 52:25.967
What the hell are you doing?

52:26.717 --> 52:28.550
I told you not to hurt anyone.

52:29.842 --> 52:31.134
Go move the stuff!

52:35.634 --> 52:37.299
No more debts to you now.

52:37.300 --> 52:39.633
The kids from school saved your life.

52:39.634 --> 52:42.592
Now, you better leave, or my
brothers will be back for you.

53:01.134 --> 53:05.592
What do we do without the
last of our food and the car?

53:06.303 --> 53:07.802
And your insulin...

53:07.803 --> 53:09.928
Don't let our comrades know.

53:15.053 --> 53:18.010
We'll take refuge in the Chinese Embassy.

53:18.011 --> 53:21.135
We have no travel pass,
what if we get caught?

53:21.136 --> 53:23.844
Better to get caught by government troops.

53:23.845 --> 53:27.595
At least they'll guarantee
the safety of diplomats.

53:31.511 --> 53:35.136
So all of you pack quickly,
and steel your hearts.

53:35.970 --> 53:37.553
From now on, our goal...

53:38.678 --> 53:39.970
is survival.

55:20.011 --> 55:21.011
Everyone come in.

55:22.011 --> 55:24.636
Go in. Go in.

55:25.886 --> 55:27.552
The only option now

55:27.553 --> 55:30.260
is to somehow get to the
airport and board a rescue flight.

55:30.261 --> 55:31.595
We barely made it here.

55:32.428 --> 55:34.719
With the kids, we'll
never reach the airport.

55:34.720 --> 55:35.678
Even so,

55:36.761 --> 55:38.302
we can't go back.

55:38.303 --> 55:39.428
Comrade Ambassador!

56:31.678 --> 56:33.385
There are Chinese here!

56:33.386 --> 56:34.845
There are Chinese here!

56:35.803 --> 56:36.845
Run away!

56:52.970 --> 56:54.261
Stay low! Keep going!

57:01.011 --> 57:02.260
Come quickly! Quickly!

57:02.261 --> 57:03.845
Stay by the wall.

57:11.238 --> 57:14.196
How much longer do we have
to guard the South Koreans?

57:14.197 --> 57:16.572
To leave, you'll need money.

57:40.738 --> 57:42.113
What are you doing?

57:43.363 --> 57:44.946
This isn't right.

57:44.947 --> 57:47.654
They've got armed guards.

57:47.655 --> 57:49.405
Is this because you're out of insulin?

57:50.072 --> 57:51.529
What?

57:51.530 --> 57:53.696
Beg the South Korean bastards for help,

57:53.697 --> 57:56.155
and turn even our children into traitors?

57:56.780 --> 58:00.529
What's the point in surviving
here just to get purged back home?

58:00.530 --> 58:03.197
You think I'm planning to defect?

58:05.530 --> 58:08.697
If there's trouble, we'll just
take over their embassy.

58:11.280 --> 58:14.613
From now on, don't stop
me if you have no other ideas.

58:24.405 --> 58:25.946
Don't shoot!

58:25.947 --> 58:26.947
Don't shoot.

58:27.697 --> 58:28.988
Ambassador Han!

58:30.155 --> 58:31.613
Ambassador Han Shin-sung!

58:32.822 --> 58:34.362
It's Ambassador Rim!

58:34.363 --> 58:36.947
- It's the North Koreans, right?
- Ambassador Han!

58:38.222 --> 58:39.430
Don't shoot!

58:39.431 --> 58:40.721
Don't shoot!

58:40.722 --> 58:44.180
We're from the North Korean Embassy!

58:44.181 --> 58:45.263
Hey, hey!

58:45.264 --> 58:47.388
Stop, stop!

58:47.389 --> 58:48.806
I said stop, asshole!

58:49.853 --> 58:52.102
Ambassador Han, talk to me!

58:52.103 --> 58:53.603
What's going on?

58:56.103 --> 58:59.519
I'm the North Korean
Ambassador Rim Yong-su!

59:00.619 --> 59:02.118
I'm here to see Ambassador Han.

59:02.119 --> 59:03.910
But what's your purpose coming here?

59:03.911 --> 59:06.827
We met a mob on the way to the
Chinese Embassy and ended up here.

59:11.225 --> 59:12.911
The Chinese Embassy is that way.

59:13.443 --> 59:14.536
Turn back!

59:15.577 --> 59:17.451
There are women and children with us.

59:17.452 --> 59:18.494
Come out!

59:20.452 --> 59:24.118
As you can see, we're all unarmed!

59:24.119 --> 59:25.077
Unarmed?

59:25.869 --> 59:27.827
What are they scheming now?

59:29.161 --> 59:32.035
So tell us your business! Your business!

59:32.036 --> 59:33.286
That rotten scoundrel!

59:34.327 --> 59:37.577
They know why we're here,
they're just humiliating us.

59:39.577 --> 59:41.327
Hide, quick!

59:42.411 --> 59:44.536
Please, at least take the children!

59:46.286 --> 59:47.243
Are you mad?

59:47.244 --> 59:49.410
Who told you to beg to the South Koreans?

59:49.411 --> 59:53.119
If State Security had secured
our safety, we wouldn't be here!

59:53.702 --> 59:56.035
I'll rip your head off for saying that!

59:56.036 --> 59:57.493
Counselor Tae!

59:57.494 --> 59:58.577
What are they doing?

59:59.536 --> 01:00:02.410
Creeping around at night
in such a dangerous place.

01:00:02.411 --> 01:00:03.826
In front of another embassy...

01:00:03.827 --> 01:00:05.077
But Ambassador.

01:00:06.661 --> 01:00:08.576
This could be our lucky chance.

01:00:08.577 --> 01:00:09.618
What?

01:00:09.619 --> 01:00:12.452
Has an entire embassy ever defected before?

01:00:39.702 --> 01:00:41.993
Don't get any ideas, just send them away.

01:00:41.994 --> 01:00:45.077
They have kids there,
you'll just let them die?

01:00:46.286 --> 01:00:47.411
What about us?

01:00:48.119 --> 01:00:49.743
Go away! Just go back!

01:00:49.744 --> 01:00:51.411
- Someone's there!
- We're all in danger with you there!

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:58.161
Just go inside!

01:01:30.661 --> 01:01:32.952
Stay the hell away, you assholes!

01:01:49.369 --> 01:01:50.536
Come on out.

01:02:01.286 --> 01:02:03.576
Then what is it, huh?

01:02:03.577 --> 01:02:04.743
What do you want?

01:02:04.744 --> 01:02:06.077
Hey.

01:02:06.661 --> 01:02:09.619
Our embassy was attacked by armed rioters.

01:02:10.494 --> 01:02:14.535
That's not our problem.

01:02:14.536 --> 01:02:16.827
As you see, we have children here.

01:02:17.869 --> 01:02:20.201
Consider it as a humanitarian gesture.

01:02:20.202 --> 01:02:23.036
After all you did to us, you
appeal to our humanity?

01:02:24.369 --> 01:02:27.494
You said not to sell out your compatriots.

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:29.994
Ambassador Han.

01:02:33.411 --> 01:02:34.744
We have nowhere to go.

01:02:46.494 --> 01:02:49.702
Taking kids into the streets
in a situation like this...

01:02:53.452 --> 01:02:54.619
What time is it?

01:02:59.744 --> 01:03:01.827
Have the kids eaten?

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:10.077
Let them in.

01:03:21.119 --> 01:03:25.076
Prepare your IDs. Luggage on this side.

01:03:25.077 --> 01:03:30.243
You'll be searched before
entering, so line up by family.

01:03:30.244 --> 01:03:33.951
I heard they're trained to kill
people with their bare hands.

01:03:33.952 --> 01:03:37.285
The Ambassador's trusting
Counselor Kang too much.

01:03:37.286 --> 01:03:40.076
You try talking him out of it.

01:03:40.077 --> 01:03:43.951
They've got kids, will
they really try anything?

01:03:43.952 --> 01:03:47.327
You know North Korean
kids all get military training?

01:03:48.702 --> 01:03:49.910
Come forward.

01:03:49.911 --> 01:03:50.994
Arms up.

01:04:45.489 --> 01:04:48.154
This is not what we agreed to.

01:04:48.155 --> 01:04:50.696
They are too many people to protect.

01:04:50.697 --> 01:04:51.821
What?

01:04:51.822 --> 01:04:53.654
Hey. Many people, no problem!

01:04:53.655 --> 01:04:55.238
Your job.

01:04:55.239 --> 01:04:56.821
Protect embassy.

01:04:56.822 --> 01:04:58.238
This is same.

01:04:58.239 --> 01:05:00.988
Well, you still have to give us more money.

01:05:00.989 --> 01:05:01.989
We are out of bullets.

01:05:03.155 --> 01:05:05.447
What a bunch of thieves.

01:05:16.489 --> 01:05:19.697
As you can see, we don't have much,

01:05:20.489 --> 01:05:22.489
but please eat your fill.

01:05:24.371 --> 01:05:26.704
Okay, let's eat.

01:05:52.364 --> 01:05:53.697
Aren't you hungry?

01:06:11.239 --> 01:06:12.155
Okay?

01:06:26.739 --> 01:06:27.822
Give this over there.

01:08:23.904 --> 01:08:25.279
Oh, Lord!

01:08:28.493 --> 01:08:32.411
You scared me. You shouldn't wander alone.

01:08:34.661 --> 01:08:37.911
Go back to your family.

01:08:38.911 --> 01:08:41.243
Do you have sugar?

01:08:41.345 --> 01:08:43.970
Sugar? Why?

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:46.469
You want something sweet?

01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:48.095
Want a cookie?

01:08:48.803 --> 01:08:49.886
Not for me.

01:08:50.678 --> 01:08:51.636
Then who?

01:08:53.761 --> 01:08:55.303
Medicine for my grandpa...

01:08:57.261 --> 01:08:58.801
Medicine?

01:08:58.803 --> 01:09:01.095
He has diabetes?

01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:10.011
Your wife told my wife.

01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:13.094
That the rioters even stole your medicine.

01:09:13.095 --> 01:09:15.845
But Secretary Gong has
diabetes, so we have insulin.

01:09:16.966 --> 01:09:18.595
It's fortunate.

01:09:21.553 --> 01:09:23.678
Well, not that Secretary
Gong has diabetes...

01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:26.970
She shouldn't have told you.

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:31.886
But thank you.

01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:42.801
Is it inconvenient being left-handed?

01:09:42.803 --> 01:09:43.678
What?

01:09:45.178 --> 01:09:46.595
You use your left hand.

01:09:47.178 --> 01:09:50.470
Not as much as diabetes. I use both hands.

01:09:51.386 --> 01:09:53.386
Don't want people calling me a leftist.

01:09:55.637 --> 01:10:02.595
But with the rebels in charge,
why would they loot the embassy

01:10:03.673 --> 01:10:05.090
of the country that armed them?

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:09.839
You really believe we
sold weapons to the rebels?

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.880
No reason not to believe it.

01:10:11.881 --> 01:10:14.548
You don't want to know the truth.

01:10:15.215 --> 01:10:19.505
Even if you did, it
wouldn't change your mind.

01:10:19.506 --> 01:10:23.798
Just like we assume it was
you who spread those rumors.

01:10:25.465 --> 01:10:28.965
I'm starting to learn that
sometimes there are two truths.

01:10:31.131 --> 01:10:33.964
Anyway, since you are here,

01:10:33.965 --> 01:10:37.423
why don't you explain
your position clearly?

01:10:41.048 --> 01:10:44.215
Do you think we're going
to defect to South Korea?

01:10:47.506 --> 01:10:50.505
Let's do honest diplomacy. Honest, okay?

01:10:50.506 --> 01:10:52.631
You didn't come here to eat dinner.

01:10:53.381 --> 01:10:57.673
Just as a person or a nation has dignity,

01:10:58.506 --> 01:11:00.965
there is dignity to diplomacy, too.

01:11:02.911 --> 01:11:05.410
We didn't throw away our pride coming here.

01:11:05.411 --> 01:11:06.618
Okay.

01:11:06.619 --> 01:11:10.201
Ambassador Rim, I know
you're much more experienced

01:11:10.202 --> 01:11:12.035
and capable than I am.

01:11:12.036 --> 01:11:15.744
But still, you're not in a
position right now to lecture me.

01:11:17.244 --> 01:11:19.327
It's just the two of us here.

01:11:19.952 --> 01:11:23.576
Let's have dialogue, not a lecture.

01:11:23.577 --> 01:11:25.619
Let's speak from the heart.

01:11:27.411 --> 01:11:31.452
Are you even grateful
to us for what we did?

01:11:43.286 --> 01:11:45.201
Hey, you know the water's cut off!

01:11:45.202 --> 01:11:48.951
How could you take a dump like that?

01:11:48.952 --> 01:11:50.577
That's not my poo...

01:12:25.244 --> 01:12:26.244
Ma'am,

01:12:27.244 --> 01:12:31.036
would you like to sleep in that room there?

01:12:32.244 --> 01:12:33.452
I'm fine here.

01:12:37.806 --> 01:12:40.181
I've got some ginseng liquor...

01:12:41.389 --> 01:12:43.014
You have it.

01:12:46.556 --> 01:12:49.055
No point in us staying here.

01:12:49.056 --> 01:12:50.598
Let's just go, quick!

01:13:27.639 --> 01:13:29.638
NAME: BAE YONG-SOOK YEAR OF BIRTH: 1935

01:13:29.639 --> 01:13:32.806
CONVERSION CERTIFICATE

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:40.681
Damn it...

01:13:52.473 --> 01:13:54.805
CONVERSION CERTIFICATE

01:13:54.806 --> 01:13:56.014
A conversion certificate.

01:13:59.764 --> 01:14:02.764
So you're planning to drag us to Seoul?

01:14:03.848 --> 01:14:05.263
Hey! Shit...

01:14:05.264 --> 01:14:07.138
Hey, did we ask you here?

01:14:07.139 --> 01:14:08.348
You came yourselves!

01:14:11.306 --> 01:14:14.931
Your guards all ran away,
so you've got some nerve.

01:14:32.098 --> 01:14:33.014
You scoundrel!

01:14:36.877 --> 01:14:40.584
Honey, it sounds like
trouble, shouldn't you go?

01:14:40.585 --> 01:14:41.919
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:14:42.669 --> 01:14:45.043
I need to protect all of you.

01:14:45.044 --> 01:14:47.169
The guards. Get the guards.

01:14:49.335 --> 01:14:50.419
Damn...

01:15:14.044 --> 01:15:17.918
What is this, huh?

01:15:18.544 --> 01:15:20.085
What is this?

01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:27.959
Apologize, you rotten scoundrel.

01:15:28.061 --> 01:15:29.810
Or fight to the end.

01:15:29.811 --> 01:15:31.852
You shithead!

01:15:31.853 --> 01:15:34.685
A commie like you
should be ripped to pieces

01:15:34.686 --> 01:15:37.270
and thrown into the battlefield outside,

01:15:37.962 --> 01:15:41.686
but, shit, I'm restraining myself, okay?

01:15:42.978 --> 01:15:44.145
What is this?

01:15:46.478 --> 01:15:47.895
What's going on?

01:15:50.311 --> 01:15:51.769
Comrade Ambassador,

01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:55.436
I caught these bastards trying to use us.

01:15:56.978 --> 01:15:58.603
To make us defect,

01:15:59.270 --> 01:16:01.978
they were forging conversion certificates.

01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:05.561
I heard you, so stop.

01:16:07.228 --> 01:16:10.560
Was this your order?
Or did he plan it himself?

01:16:10.561 --> 01:16:11.935
Let's speak alone.

01:16:11.936 --> 01:16:14.310
If those people don't convert to our side,

01:16:14.311 --> 01:16:16.769
we're violating the National Security Law.

01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:18.145
What violation?

01:16:18.936 --> 01:16:21.269
You think we're plotting
some rebellion here?

01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:23.394
Then why in hell should
we be protecting them?

01:16:23.395 --> 01:16:24.477
What bullshit.

01:16:24.478 --> 01:16:26.852
The guards are gone, who's protecting who?

01:16:26.853 --> 01:16:29.811
Your police guard ran away!

01:16:36.311 --> 01:16:37.810
What's this?

01:16:37.811 --> 01:16:40.686
They charge for protection by the head,

01:16:41.353 --> 01:16:42.728
can we afford that?

01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:58.977
The conversion certificates
were made without my order

01:16:58.978 --> 01:17:00.645
by our Counselor alone.

01:17:01.864 --> 01:17:03.739
As the person in charge, I apologize.

01:17:04.947 --> 01:17:07.446
We might've done the same.

01:17:07.447 --> 01:17:09.571
It's water under the bridge.

01:17:09.572 --> 01:17:12.322
That's not the important issue now.

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:16.863
What will you do now?

01:17:16.864 --> 01:17:19.529
We've already abandoned our embassy,

01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:22.238
so we don't mind leaving here.

01:17:22.239 --> 01:17:23.114
And you?

01:17:24.364 --> 01:17:26.696
We won't last long here without guards.

01:17:26.697 --> 01:17:28.697
We need a way out, too.

01:17:32.155 --> 01:17:35.404
If we combine our diplomatic
and intelligence capabilities,

01:17:35.405 --> 01:17:36.989
can we find a way?

01:17:38.572 --> 01:17:42.529
You think we can accomplish more together?

01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:46.364
Neither of us will make it
out without outside help.

01:17:47.405 --> 01:17:51.405
If we try our Western allies, and
you work your Communist allies,

01:17:52.239 --> 01:17:54.321
maybe a route will open.

01:17:54.322 --> 01:17:57.988
But it's not just up to us two.

01:17:57.989 --> 01:18:01.029
Will your Counselor and staff agree?

01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:03.114
That's my responsibility as Ambassador.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.779
Let's state our goal clearly.

01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:09.529
We're not aiming for reunification,

01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:13.029
we're just banding together
to find a way out, okay?

01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:16.988
Let's forget this and go
our own way at daybreak.

01:18:16.989 --> 01:18:19.238
Let's not get into a
conspiracy with the South.

01:18:19.239 --> 01:18:21.405
What damned conspiracy?

01:18:22.155 --> 01:18:24.334
You think that ridiculous
conversion certificate

01:18:24.359 --> 01:18:25.905
will be any effective?

01:18:26.614 --> 01:18:28.529
Your tone is a bit...

01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:32.321
Counselor, don't break
the flow here. Let's proceed.

01:18:32.322 --> 01:18:34.363
Anyway, whether North or South,

01:18:34.364 --> 01:18:37.571
let's try arranging a route
out through the big embassies.

01:18:37.572 --> 01:18:41.154
The Americans have pulled
out, so that's not an option.

01:18:41.155 --> 01:18:44.446
The Italian Embassy is
close, and might be fastest.

01:18:44.447 --> 01:18:47.654
Besides, Italy once helped
Somalia under a trusteeship,

01:18:47.655 --> 01:18:51.696
so they have more influence than the
US, and they still send rescue planes.

01:18:51.697 --> 01:18:55.697
We're not diplomatic partners
with Italy, so will they help us?

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.530
Not a likely solution for us.

01:19:00.405 --> 01:19:01.280
Look,

01:19:01.989 --> 01:19:05.404
if we go 500 km south to Kismaayo Port,

01:19:05.405 --> 01:19:07.489
we can take a boat to Kenya.

01:19:07.559 --> 01:19:11.529
500 km, are you kidding?
How will you go 500 km?

01:19:11.530 --> 01:19:13.488
You got a car for all those people?

01:19:13.489 --> 01:19:14.404
And gas?

01:19:14.405 --> 01:19:16.696
What if you run into rebels?

01:19:16.697 --> 01:19:18.363
Don't you even think?

01:19:18.364 --> 01:19:20.946
Hey, did I ask you to come with us?

01:19:20.947 --> 01:19:22.155
Why are you...

01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:25.978
Everyone calm down and look at this.

01:19:26.811 --> 01:19:27.853
Here,

01:19:28.811 --> 01:19:30.935
the Egyptian Embassy still stands.

01:19:30.936 --> 01:19:33.977
We can ask them if
there's a way to reach Cairo.

01:19:33.978 --> 01:19:36.769
South Korea has no
diplomatic relations with Egypt,

01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:38.186
so bad luck for you.

01:19:39.186 --> 01:19:41.394
We have a consulate there.

01:19:41.395 --> 01:19:42.436
Let's do this.

01:19:43.228 --> 01:19:45.435
We'll take the Italian Embassy,

01:19:45.436 --> 01:19:49.395
you take the Egyptian Embassy,
and we'll see which way works best.

01:19:50.686 --> 01:19:51.686
What if...

01:19:52.561 --> 01:19:57.395
only one side is offered a way out?

01:19:59.603 --> 01:20:01.436
At least some of us will live.

01:20:53.728 --> 01:20:56.477
Don't open the gate, even for police.

01:20:56.478 --> 01:20:57.560
Okay.

01:20:57.561 --> 01:20:58.686
I'll pray.

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.144
Don't, don't!

01:21:48.145 --> 01:21:49.352
Please spare me!

01:21:49.353 --> 01:21:50.186
What is it?

01:21:57.311 --> 01:21:58.270
Back up!

01:23:20.397 --> 01:23:21.314
Sir!

01:23:22.022 --> 01:23:25.647
Ambassador Mario is
on the phone with Italy.

01:23:26.317 --> 01:23:27.732
Not sure how long it'll take.

01:23:27.733 --> 01:23:28.608
Really?

01:23:29.934 --> 01:23:30.900
Wait.

01:23:31.525 --> 01:23:34.108
You mean their phones are connected?

01:23:35.358 --> 01:23:38.482
It's a battlefield over
here, a battlefield.

01:23:38.483 --> 01:23:39.942
Don't you even watch the news?

01:23:40.306 --> 01:23:42.817
Are you just telling me to die over here?

01:23:43.858 --> 01:23:44.692
Hello--

01:23:48.817 --> 01:23:50.357
What did they say?

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:52.775
I reached the Korean Embassy in Kenya,

01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:55.358
but they can't send a plane.

01:23:57.650 --> 01:23:58.942
Ambassador Han!

01:24:02.567 --> 01:24:03.567
Ambassador.

01:24:04.150 --> 01:24:06.400
So I heard there are 20 of you in all?

01:24:07.502 --> 01:24:09.209
Including children, yes.

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:13.044
Okay, we do have a Red
Cross medical plane. Right?

01:24:13.627 --> 01:24:14.669
But...

01:24:15.919 --> 01:24:17.584
Look, Ambassador. Frankly speaking,

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:19.251
we can't take North Koreans

01:24:19.252 --> 01:24:21.709
whom we don't have diplomatic ties with,

01:24:21.710 --> 01:24:24.460
when we can barely fit all of
our own people on the plane.

01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:30.460
So why don't we evacuate
South Koreans first?

01:24:34.627 --> 01:24:36.585
What are you contemplating? Say okay.

01:24:37.181 --> 01:24:38.710
And the North Koreans?

01:24:39.294 --> 01:24:41.543
They can ask at the Egyptian Embassy.

01:24:41.544 --> 01:24:42.835
What if they say no?

01:24:45.502 --> 01:24:47.168
Just second please.

01:24:47.169 --> 01:24:48.710
- Just a second.
- Okay.

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:52.835
After all this, you'll
give up our ticket out?

01:24:54.127 --> 01:24:56.751
If we'd made them
defect from the beginning,

01:24:56.752 --> 01:24:59.919
they'd be South Koreans
and they could all come.

01:25:01.169 --> 01:25:02.002
Exactly!

01:25:03.919 --> 01:25:05.627
Ambassador Mario.

01:25:07.002 --> 01:25:08.543
Actually,

01:25:08.544 --> 01:25:12.710
those North Koreans
have defected to our side.

01:25:19.835 --> 01:25:21.168
I'm sorry...

01:25:21.169 --> 01:25:24.710
But as you can see,
we're in no position to help.

01:25:25.502 --> 01:25:29.084
Can you at least help us contact
the North Korean Embassy in Cairo?

01:25:29.085 --> 01:25:30.834
We want tell that we're safe.

01:25:30.835 --> 01:25:32.710
But all our communications are down.

01:25:33.835 --> 01:25:35.334
Well that...

01:25:35.335 --> 01:25:36.668
I can try.

01:25:36.669 --> 01:25:41.626
Can you also contact the South
Korean Consulate General in Cairo?

01:25:41.627 --> 01:25:42.709
South Korea?

01:25:42.710 --> 01:25:43.710
Yes.

01:25:49.002 --> 01:25:50.627
What's taking them so long?

01:25:51.794 --> 01:25:54.335
If you'd said we'll go
alone, we'd be on the plane.

01:25:56.002 --> 01:25:57.959
What are you thinking?

01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.960
They're not really going to defect.

01:26:00.728 --> 01:26:03.560
Will you take responsibility
if it all falls through?

01:26:03.561 --> 01:26:04.769
Responsibility?

01:26:04.770 --> 01:26:06.478
Our seats are secure.

01:26:10.103 --> 01:26:11.770
There's a way we can both live.

01:26:13.353 --> 01:26:14.978
Need to try what we can.

01:26:24.936 --> 01:26:27.936
We should never have
let them in last night.

01:26:28.978 --> 01:26:29.936
Right?

01:26:32.853 --> 01:26:35.436
Let's just think of getting on the plane.

01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:43.103
Ambassador.

01:26:44.936 --> 01:26:48.810
Well, the South Korean Government
officially requested to our government

01:26:48.811 --> 01:26:50.310
to assist them.

01:26:50.311 --> 01:26:51.394
Okay so thankfully,

01:26:51.395 --> 01:26:54.770
everyone in your party will get
a place on the evacuation plane.

01:26:55.603 --> 01:26:57.602
But the plane may arrive later today,

01:26:57.603 --> 01:26:58.810
so I need you to get back

01:26:58.811 --> 01:27:01.395
by 4PM at the latest and stand by.

01:27:02.478 --> 01:27:04.603
- Grazie! Grazie mille!
- It's okay.

01:27:05.228 --> 01:27:07.728
Ask if they can possibly
let us borrow a car.

01:27:09.103 --> 01:27:10.311
A car?

01:27:10.895 --> 01:27:13.645
We don't have enough cars for everyone.

01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:35.934
What are they doing?

01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:54.644
Ambassador, can we talk privately?

01:27:54.645 --> 01:27:55.478
Yes.

01:27:56.311 --> 01:27:57.478
Counselor Kang.

01:28:00.330 --> 01:28:04.829
We got a car from the Egyptians,
so transportation is no problem,

01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:08.996
but if we drive out and run
into some rebels like before,

01:28:08.997 --> 01:28:10.496
we're dead meat.

01:28:10.497 --> 01:28:13.829
We need to wait for one
side to get the upper hand.

01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:17.579
Is that rescue plane some
kind of taxi you can flag down?

01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:20.579
If you don't catch that
plane, what'll you do then?

01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:23.038
Lower your voice. You're scaring people.

01:28:25.872 --> 01:28:27.955
I heard the Egyptian
Embassy can't help you?

01:28:29.598 --> 01:28:33.638
You saw on the way, the
whole city's a battleground.

01:28:33.639 --> 01:28:35.014
Waiting is pointless.

01:28:35.764 --> 01:28:37.389
What will you do?

01:28:38.223 --> 01:28:39.223
We're going.

01:28:46.639 --> 01:28:49.431
Have you got any extra books?

01:28:50.139 --> 01:28:51.014
Books?

01:29:07.264 --> 01:29:09.431
- Hurry!
- I am hurrying!

01:29:11.139 --> 01:29:12.597
- Turn it!
- Careful.

01:29:12.598 --> 01:29:13.806
Look out!

01:29:16.514 --> 01:29:17.514
Oh, Lord!

01:29:25.306 --> 01:29:27.139
What are you doing in this emergency?

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:56.764
Hey kids, fill these with dirt.

01:30:04.098 --> 01:30:06.973
You're going to kill us before we even go!

01:30:11.092 --> 01:30:12.607
Why take it off?

01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:16.307
If you use too much, we'll run out.

01:30:16.308 --> 01:30:18.006
How will it support the weight?

01:30:19.308 --> 01:30:22.807
Look at this. This should
go here, and then that there...

01:30:22.808 --> 01:30:24.141
So we can drive...

01:30:24.142 --> 01:30:26.642
Do we have to stick them inside?

01:30:27.642 --> 01:30:29.600
Just carry some sand bags.

01:30:30.975 --> 01:30:32.599
Hey, everyone!

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:34.516
It's time to go.

01:30:34.517 --> 01:30:37.432
We need to get there
before afternoon prayer ends.

01:30:37.433 --> 01:30:39.599
Get in!

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:42.308
Everyone, move! Don't just stand there!

01:30:59.933 --> 01:31:02.683
Have mercy on us...

01:31:16.183 --> 01:31:18.599
Let's all meet safely

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:20.475
at the Italian Embassy!

01:32:46.850 --> 01:32:48.517
Assalamu alaikum!

01:33:55.808 --> 01:33:57.642
Just wait a minute!

01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:09.599
It's okay, they're government troops.

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.308
Give me the white flag.

01:34:14.225 --> 01:34:15.725
Damn...

01:34:25.074 --> 01:34:27.283
Give me that. Yes, that.

01:34:28.241 --> 01:34:30.408
It's okay, don't worry.

01:34:36.574 --> 01:34:38.533
A gun! A gun!

01:34:39.491 --> 01:34:40.783
Duck!

01:34:41.949 --> 01:34:42.908
What happened?

01:34:46.283 --> 01:34:47.324
Back up!

01:34:57.533 --> 01:34:58.658
Look out behind!

01:35:02.783 --> 01:35:03.783
Don't turn your head!

01:35:47.616 --> 01:35:48.783
Follow me!

01:36:12.741 --> 01:36:13.824
You okay?

01:36:34.366 --> 01:36:35.574
Shit!

01:36:55.866 --> 01:36:58.366
The gun behind us! Watch out!

01:37:01.241 --> 01:37:02.449
Get down!

01:37:09.033 --> 01:37:10.408
Hold on!

01:37:19.533 --> 01:37:20.783
Duck!

01:37:52.892 --> 01:37:55.058
To the left!

01:38:51.017 --> 01:38:53.558
Grab the gun! Push him!

01:39:13.975 --> 01:39:15.100
Watch out for the gun!

01:39:16.642 --> 01:39:18.892
- Honey, watch out!
- You scoundrel!

01:39:20.892 --> 01:39:22.892
Grab the gun! Get the gun!

01:39:26.975 --> 01:39:30.266
Brake!

01:39:30.267 --> 01:39:33.182
- Step on the brake!
- Honey, the brake!

01:39:33.183 --> 01:39:34.683
- Hit the brake!
- Hold on tight!

01:39:37.142 --> 01:39:38.267
The gun!

01:39:57.225 --> 01:39:58.432
We're there!

01:39:58.433 --> 01:39:59.683
We made it!

01:40:15.642 --> 01:40:16.850
Honey!

01:40:22.089 --> 01:40:23.756
Stay there!

01:40:31.048 --> 01:40:32.298
Are you okay?

01:40:36.089 --> 01:40:38.048
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

01:40:46.381 --> 01:40:47.547
Are you okay?

01:40:47.548 --> 01:40:49.381
I'm okay. Are you?

01:40:54.574 --> 01:40:57.490
Hey, we have no time!

01:40:57.491 --> 01:40:59.282
Take the white flags and follow!

01:40:59.283 --> 01:41:01.533
Take the white flags!

01:41:02.449 --> 01:41:03.907
Go.

01:41:03.908 --> 01:41:05.657
Run!

01:41:05.658 --> 01:41:07.033
Run!

01:41:11.074 --> 01:41:12.199
Follow me!

01:41:14.991 --> 01:41:16.533
Don't shoot!

01:41:20.824 --> 01:41:22.866
We Are Korean!

01:41:23.824 --> 01:41:26.073
Don't shoot!

01:41:26.074 --> 01:41:27.741
Keep out!

01:41:52.991 --> 01:41:54.783
Down! Get down!

01:41:58.616 --> 01:41:59.699
Keep out!

01:42:00.283 --> 01:42:01.283
Shut up!

01:42:06.908 --> 01:42:08.990
This is our country!

01:42:08.991 --> 01:42:11.240
Keep out! This is Italian property!

01:42:11.241 --> 01:42:13.240
- Behind the car! Hurry!
- The kids! Duck!

01:42:13.241 --> 01:42:14.324
- Hurry!
- Over here!

01:42:14.949 --> 01:42:16.783
- Honey!
- Go quickly!

01:42:17.616 --> 01:42:18.449
Quickly!

01:42:22.408 --> 01:42:23.323
Everyone here?

01:42:23.324 --> 01:42:24.615
- All the kids?
- Yes.

01:42:24.616 --> 01:42:25.573
You okay?

01:42:25.574 --> 01:42:27.449
Yes, we're all fine.

01:42:33.158 --> 01:42:35.491
Open the door!

01:43:01.158 --> 01:43:04.158
Stop! This is Italian property!

01:43:06.283 --> 01:43:07.948
We are Somali government forces!

01:43:07.949 --> 01:43:09.782
This is the final warning!

01:43:09.783 --> 01:43:11.824
This is Italian property!

01:43:12.970 --> 01:43:14.845
Get out of our country!

01:43:37.996 --> 01:43:39.371
Don't shoot!

01:43:41.871 --> 01:43:44.080
We are Korean diplomats!

01:43:50.996 --> 01:43:52.038
Don't!

01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:09.454
Get out. Come.

01:44:09.455 --> 01:44:11.080
Get out.

01:44:14.121 --> 01:44:15.121
Get out...

01:44:19.955 --> 01:44:20.912
Hold on.

01:44:20.913 --> 01:44:22.955
What's wrong?

01:45:33.842 --> 01:45:36.413
The rescue plane scheduled
for yesterday arrives today.

01:45:37.675 --> 01:45:42.423
The Italian government
brokered a temporary ceasefire

01:45:42.448 --> 01:45:44.753
to allow safe passage to the airport.

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:58.920
COUNSELOR TAE JOON-KI

01:48:40.170 --> 01:48:42.003
I didn't get to say thank you!

01:48:46.337 --> 01:48:47.753
Are you going home now?

01:48:50.295 --> 01:48:52.794
Yes, we've been abroad a few years,

01:48:52.795 --> 01:48:56.211
so after reporting, we'll
see our children again.

01:48:56.212 --> 01:48:57.961
Your children are with you now.

01:48:57.962 --> 01:48:59.877
When we diplomats go abroad,

01:48:59.878 --> 01:49:02.295
we leave one family
member each in Pyongyang.

01:49:03.295 --> 01:49:07.128
If we don't go back,
they all become orphans.

01:49:16.503 --> 01:49:17.712
Ambassador Rim?

01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:21.837
You have no diplomatic
relations with Kenya.

01:49:23.295 --> 01:49:25.461
When we get to Mombasa Airport,

01:49:25.462 --> 01:49:29.920
our embassy agreed to give
you cars and accommodation.

01:49:31.545 --> 01:49:34.128
Don't misunderstand our intentions,

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:38.753
but if you need it, we can go together.

01:49:40.253 --> 01:49:42.962
Last night at the Italian Embassy,

01:49:43.587 --> 01:49:47.337
we were able to contact Pyongyang,
and they made arrangements.

01:49:50.087 --> 01:49:51.253
Ambassador Han!

01:49:52.712 --> 01:49:55.170
I'm late, but thank you sincerely.

01:50:38.962 --> 01:50:40.419
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:44.587
we have arrived safely at
Mombasa Airport in Kenya.

01:50:57.003 --> 01:51:00.462
We just want the defectors,
ignore those Commies.

01:51:05.628 --> 01:51:08.837
Get the defectors in our car.

01:51:09.670 --> 01:51:11.294
Take care now.

01:51:11.295 --> 01:51:12.128
You too.

01:51:14.712 --> 01:51:15.920
Listen up!

01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:18.711
We'll get off first!

01:51:18.712 --> 01:51:22.628
The North Koreans go
behind us with those foreigners!

01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:30.044
Both countries sent teams,

01:51:30.045 --> 01:51:32.128
waiting for us outside.

01:51:32.837 --> 01:51:36.919
Once we get off, be sure not
to acknowledge each other.

01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:39.253
Ambassador Rim, please look after them.

01:51:40.170 --> 01:51:41.295
And everyone

01:51:42.545 --> 01:51:45.253
say your farewells here.

01:52:05.712 --> 01:52:06.795
Let's go!

01:52:07.378 --> 01:52:11.461
- Quick!
- Honey! Intelligence officers are here!

01:52:11.462 --> 01:52:13.086
Secretary Gong, we need to get off first!

01:52:13.087 --> 01:52:14.045
I'm coming!

01:52:27.295 --> 01:52:28.211
Director!

01:52:28.212 --> 01:52:29.670
- Hey!
- Director!

01:52:30.795 --> 01:52:33.337
Nice work. The North Koreans?

01:52:34.670 --> 01:52:36.545
- What?
- The Northerners.

01:52:37.545 --> 01:52:38.544
The Commies!

01:52:38.545 --> 01:52:40.377
Oh, he wanted to greet you, Director.

01:52:40.378 --> 01:52:41.794
Ambassador to Somalia, Han Shin-sung.

01:52:41.795 --> 01:52:43.669
What about the defectors?

01:52:43.670 --> 01:52:45.377
We're all safe.

01:52:45.378 --> 01:52:46.253
No, no...

01:52:54.587 --> 01:52:55.711
Over there!

01:52:55.712 --> 01:52:57.377
Hey, over there!

01:52:57.378 --> 01:52:58.752
Aren't those the defectors?

01:52:58.753 --> 01:52:59.712
Director, look.

01:53:00.295 --> 01:53:02.627
These foreign reporters are all here.

01:53:02.628 --> 01:53:05.045
We can't clash with
them here. Let's talk there.

01:53:05.628 --> 01:53:08.544
- How can we leave the defectors?
- Defectors?

01:53:08.545 --> 01:53:10.045
Director! The reporters' cameras!

01:53:11.087 --> 01:53:12.378
Damn...
