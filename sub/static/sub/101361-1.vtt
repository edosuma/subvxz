WEBVTT

01:22.840 --> 01:23.841
Water.

01:23.873 --> 01:25.676
Cloud.

01:25.709 --> 01:26.709
Always a pleasure.

01:51.334 --> 01:53.370
Hm, consider yourself lucky.

01:53.403 --> 01:54.738
Lucky?

01:54.772 --> 01:56.641
We're all replaceable,
don't forget that.

02:02.612 --> 02:03.612
Water.

02:13.022 --> 02:16.960
In our future, one simple breath

02:16.993 --> 02:18.930
could mean life or death.

02:20.963 --> 02:24.836
As we search for a solution,
pollution engulfs our world.

02:27.403 --> 02:29.306
If we don't find an answer fast,

02:30.640 --> 02:32.509
all living things shall perish.

02:39.449 --> 02:42.286
Bioscanners have been embedded
into each human being.

02:43.221 --> 02:45.855
They were created to
help produce clean air

02:45.889 --> 02:49.826
for each individual,
but they are expensive

02:51.027 --> 02:52.896
and third world countries are
suffering.

02:54.465 --> 02:56.867
Now, bioscanners are failing.

02:58.534 --> 02:59.936
But a new code has been
developed.

03:06.877 --> 03:09.077
We are the five elements who
strive to protect humanity.

03:12.616 --> 03:14.576
Years ago, many warriors
came to us seeking change

03:17.788 --> 03:19.356
and joined our way of life.

03:21.057 --> 03:25.395
Now, we must fight for our
lives to bring the code

03:26.764 --> 03:29.867
to the world or die trying.

03:46.949 --> 03:47.984
Damn.

03:56.826 --> 03:58.562
It's me, Cloud.

03:59.629 --> 04:01.531
Something happened.

04:01.564 --> 04:02.564
We need to meet.

04:03.766 --> 04:04.835
When?

04:06.669 --> 04:07.738
Where?

04:09.705 --> 04:10.705
Okay.

04:20.451 --> 04:21.851
TV on.

04:25.021 --> 04:27.757
10 million dead, yes
you heard that right.

04:27.790 --> 04:30.827
The death toll now sits at 10
million.

04:30.860 --> 04:33.531
The thinning of the ozone
layer and pollution levels

04:33.564 --> 04:35.900
continue to increase across the
globe

04:35.932 --> 04:38.868
and scientists estimate
that in five to 10 years,

04:38.901 --> 04:41.471
all living creatures may cease
to exist,

04:41.504 --> 04:43.106
unless a formula can be
developed

04:43.139 --> 04:46.043
and implemented immediately
to produce mass quantities

04:46.076 --> 04:50.014
of clean air and repair
of frail upper atmosphere.

04:50.047 --> 04:53.150
So far, third world countries
have suffered the most

04:53.182 --> 04:56.187
with whole villages and towns
dying.

04:56.220 --> 04:59.990
But now the bioscanners for
Medican Research are failing.

05:00.023 --> 05:02.059
They simply cannot keep
up with the rapid rise

05:02.091 --> 05:03.860
of ultraviolet radiation and.

05:20.744 --> 05:23.914
People are getting sicker
and the CDC estimates

05:23.947 --> 05:26.649
over 2/3 of the population
are now infected

05:26.682 --> 05:29.153
with pollution related
diseases, especially the poor...

05:29.185 --> 05:34.459
What the?

05:42.064 --> 05:43.266
We got him.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.002
Send a unit to pick up the body.

05:46.737 --> 05:48.573
We gotta clean up this mess.

06:05.055 --> 06:06.090
Who are you guys?

06:06.122 --> 06:07.122
What's going on?

06:13.564 --> 06:15.699
Hold this.

06:28.845 --> 06:29.813
Cloud.

06:29.846 --> 06:31.682
How'd you guys
know where to find me?

06:31.714 --> 06:32.548
Don't flatter yourself.

06:32.583 --> 06:35.052
We were actually tracking Emma's
killer.

06:35.084 --> 06:37.253
Oddly enough, it lead to your
apartment.

06:37.286 --> 06:39.622
Got an explanation for that?

06:39.656 --> 06:40.757
I dunno.

06:40.790 --> 06:41.968
That's when we noticed you being

06:41.992 --> 06:42.893
loaded into the ambulance.

06:42.925 --> 06:44.193
So we followed you.

06:44.226 --> 06:45.895
This is Dr. Dave of the Wind's
Clan.

06:45.928 --> 06:47.163
He was asked to help out on

06:47.197 --> 06:48.733
the investigation of Emma's
killer.

06:49.932 --> 06:51.067
Our old clan's leader.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.803
- Um.
- You guys actually met.

06:53.836 --> 06:55.104
At Earth's training school.

06:55.137 --> 06:57.974
Oh yeah, now I remember you.

06:58.007 --> 06:59.142
How's Wind doing?

06:59.175 --> 07:00.478
He's doing well, Master Cloud.

07:00.511 --> 07:02.947
Great, I heard that he's decided
to move on with his life.

07:02.980 --> 07:05.049
That's right, he's
waiting for us at the dock.

07:05.081 --> 07:06.983
- We should get going.
- Great.

07:07.016 --> 07:08.084
Four11's.

07:10.153 --> 07:11.588
What do they want with you?

07:11.622 --> 07:14.158
How do I know, I was just woke
up here.

07:17.026 --> 07:18.329
The radiation levels are
spiking.

07:18.362 --> 07:19.897
We should get going.

07:19.930 --> 07:21.132
Great.

07:25.369 --> 07:26.604
Oh, thank you.

09:00.163 --> 09:02.265
You all right?

09:05.869 --> 09:06.869
You all right?

09:13.976 --> 09:15.211
The cargo is lost.

09:20.015 --> 09:21.151
How's our son holding up?

09:22.451 --> 09:25.722
Weaker by
the hour, thanks to you.

09:27.057 --> 09:30.795
That cargo was the key to his
survival.

09:31.894 --> 09:32.894
Find it.

09:33.496 --> 09:35.466
I don't want to start a war.

09:36.166 --> 09:38.502
We can resolve this without
violence.

09:38.534 --> 09:42.305
You've wasted years chasing
this diplomatic solution

09:42.339 --> 09:45.142
of yours and you have
nothing to show for it.

09:46.176 --> 09:49.180
And now, his time grows short.

09:50.346 --> 09:54.117
If he dies, I promise you my
wrath

09:54.150 --> 09:56.853
will not be delayed or
diplomatic.

09:56.886 --> 10:01.125
Our alliance with elements
has had some setbacks.

10:01.158 --> 10:04.094
But I'm confident I can
get them to cooperate.

10:04.126 --> 10:06.062
I just need a little more time.

10:06.096 --> 10:08.131
I just...

10:08.164 --> 10:09.766
You've cost us time.

10:11.067 --> 10:12.067
There's not much left.

10:13.236 --> 10:16.307
Retrieve the package, and coerce
the elements to cooperate.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.309
Our son's life depends on it.

10:20.976 --> 10:22.078
And so does yours.

10:23.279 --> 10:27.751
That needle shall remain lodged
in you until he is saved.

10:48.437 --> 10:52.009
Sir, should I call
the doctor like before?

10:52.042 --> 10:54.311
Yeah, but later.

10:56.212 --> 10:57.814
Not until our work is done.

11:21.037 --> 11:22.072
We're too late.

11:22.105 --> 11:23.185
There's no trace of anyone.

11:24.875 --> 11:25.942
Okay.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.520
You've gotten flabby.

11:37.553 --> 11:38.553
Too many carbs?

11:46.596 --> 11:48.030
Is that all you got?

11:48.063 --> 11:49.565
Oh, Gold.

11:49.599 --> 11:51.368
You better cool it down a bit.

11:51.400 --> 11:54.103
You're the Gold that
trained with us before.

11:54.136 --> 11:57.206
You never know what's up Wood's
sleeve.

11:57.240 --> 11:59.475
Out the old, come the new.

11:59.509 --> 12:03.212
He retired last year
and the elders choose me

12:03.245 --> 12:05.481
to be the new leader of our Gold
Clan.

12:07.250 --> 12:08.384
I guess he found peace.

12:10.220 --> 12:11.622
Now I'm the new Gold and...

12:11.654 --> 12:13.322
Maybe your elders

12:13.355 --> 12:15.391
are just trying to test you.

12:15.424 --> 12:17.160
You talk way too much.

12:38.514 --> 12:39.514
Little boy.

12:40.482 --> 12:41.482
I will own you!

12:45.322 --> 12:47.990
Okay, thanks for the update.

12:59.469 --> 13:00.938
Whatever man, you know
I could've

13:00.971 --> 13:02.371
taken you out with one blow,
right?

13:02.404 --> 13:04.341
But you didn't now,
did you?

13:04.374 --> 13:06.043
Amateurs,
I could have taken you

13:06.076 --> 13:07.378
both out in a heartbeat.

13:11.014 --> 13:14.317
Cloud called, I think he's in
trouble.

13:15.451 --> 13:18.721
I sent Dave of the Wind Clan
and Water to lend him a hand

13:18.754 --> 13:19.754
and keep him safe.

13:22.091 --> 13:23.126
I want you three to go.

13:24.126 --> 13:25.328
They may need your help.

13:41.010 --> 13:43.612
The current bioscanner
devices from Medican corporation

13:43.645 --> 13:46.216
are failing as both the
radiation and air pollution

13:46.249 --> 13:48.752
increase across the globe,
with third world countries

13:48.784 --> 13:50.486
feeling the brunt of it.

13:50.519 --> 13:52.264
People are getting sicker,
they're dying because

13:52.288 --> 13:54.291
the bioscanners can't keep up

13:54.323 --> 13:57.193
and no one's unscathed, not even
here.

13:57.226 --> 14:00.230
Right, the entire population
is infected

14:00.263 --> 14:03.033
and 25% of that have already
died.

14:03.066 --> 14:05.335
You should constantly check
your bioscanners and please

14:05.368 --> 14:08.372
remember to stay indoors
when radiation level peaks.

14:08.404 --> 14:11.375
That's right and politicians,
they remain in session until

14:11.408 --> 14:14.478
they can come up with a plan
for the next steps to take.

14:15.144 --> 14:17.014
Medican's stocks plunge

14:17.047 --> 14:18.782
as news emerges of Congress

14:18.815 --> 14:21.785
calling for a grand jury
investigation of their bioscanners.

14:21.817 --> 14:24.321
And current
Medican CEO, Mr. Steve Costa,

14:24.354 --> 14:27.290
he's received billions from
countries around the world

14:27.322 --> 14:30.092
to develop an advanced
upgrade to those bioscanners,

14:31.124 --> 14:32.562
but so far he's failed to
deliver.

14:32.595 --> 14:34.306
So can we explain to
the viewer at least how

14:34.330 --> 14:36.133
that new update is supposed to
work?

14:36.166 --> 14:37.768
Yes.

14:37.801 --> 14:40.302
So, if it worked properly,
it's a non-invasive upgrade

14:40.336 --> 14:43.407
that gets installed like
software at any Medican facility.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.575
It increases the
algorithm speed to keep up

14:45.607 --> 14:47.410
with the rising pollution
levels.

14:47.443 --> 14:48.687
And when a person goes to sleep,

14:48.711 --> 14:51.581
it recharges while still
protecting you.

14:51.614 --> 14:53.517
It's actually 24 hours a day,

14:53.549 --> 14:55.084
but there is a catch.

14:55.118 --> 14:56.796
- Good morning, Mr. Costa.
- Yes, there is.

14:56.820 --> 14:59.389
Despite billions that Medican
received to develop a cure.

14:59.422 --> 15:00.422
Did you see this?

15:01.724 --> 15:03.727
The shareholders are gonna have
my ass.

15:03.759 --> 15:05.662
Now who the hell leaked the
upgrade?

15:06.461 --> 15:08.298
- I don't...
- I need you to do some

15:08.331 --> 15:11.368
damage control and
contain any further leaks.

15:11.400 --> 15:14.837
Has the research department
cracked the biometric code yet?

15:14.870 --> 15:16.673
And send the Doc up to see me.

15:16.706 --> 15:18.274
He, he left.

15:18.307 --> 15:20.110
- He left.
- What?

15:20.143 --> 15:21.345
What do you mean he left?

15:27.317 --> 15:29.385
You know who to call.

15:29.418 --> 15:31.822
I want the Doc returned
to Medican, he's ours.

15:33.288 --> 15:35.225
The shareholders will show no
mercy,

15:36.359 --> 15:37.360
and neither will I.

15:46.168 --> 15:47.336
I've got a job for you.

Yeah, most people do that
after they had a few drinks.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.691
You know, it's kind of a bar
thing.

16:41.724 --> 16:42.724

Oh, a wedge of lime.

17:23.865 --> 17:24.934
Okay, yeah.

17:25.969 --> 17:27.403
A wedge of lime.

17:28.738 --> 17:29.738
Right there.

17:30.673 --> 17:32.342
Oh.

17:32.375 --> 17:33.710
Do you want me to dim the music?

17:33.742 --> 17:35.444
You know, yeah, dim the the
lights?

17:35.478 --> 17:36.722
Make it a little more
comfortable for you.

17:36.746 --> 17:38.582
Uh, no thanks, I'm fine.

17:38.615 --> 17:39.782
All right, yeah.

17:39.816 --> 17:40.884
Enjoy yourself.

17:41.984 --> 17:44.387
God, freakin' cheapskate.

18:01.938 --> 18:03.974
So uh, you the Doc?

18:06.308 --> 18:09.245
Ah, what we we have here?

18:12.714 --> 18:14.951
Yeah, we got him.

18:14.983 --> 18:16.220
Come on.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.461
Why don't you mind your own
business

18:25.494 --> 18:26.734
if you know what's good for ya.

18:26.762 --> 18:28.831
Four on one, not playing fair
now.

19:01.730 --> 19:02.798
Thank you.

19:49.077 --> 19:50.079
You guys got here fast.

19:50.113 --> 19:51.681
I didn't hear the sirens.

19:51.713 --> 19:53.553
Some guy ordered a soda
and all shit hit the...

20:11.567 --> 20:13.836
No, leave them alone.

20:13.869 --> 20:15.938
Let 'em take the fall when the
cops come.

20:17.038 --> 20:18.342
Yes, sir.

20:22.077 --> 20:23.145
Docs been through here.

20:23.179 --> 20:25.782
Sir, he's not far from here.

20:25.815 --> 20:27.517
Well then, let's go grab him.

20:37.460 --> 20:40.130
Hey, slow down,
what's the rush?

20:40.163 --> 20:41.597
Thanks for your help back there,

20:41.631 --> 20:43.032
but I was doing just fine on my
own.

20:43.065 --> 20:44.134
It's not about you.

20:44.166 --> 20:45.668
We were tracking Emma's killer.

20:47.036 --> 20:48.938
You just happened to be there.

20:48.971 --> 20:51.473
Yes, quite odd how you just
happened

20:51.507 --> 20:54.144
to be in the same
vicinity as Emma's killer.

20:54.176 --> 20:55.846
Funny how you just keep popping
up.

20:56.579 --> 21:00.115
Those Four11's could have
killed you and they didn't.

21:00.148 --> 21:01.483
Why?

21:01.517 --> 21:03.119
What do you they want with you?

21:03.152 --> 21:05.922
I have no idea what the
Four11 want to do with me.

21:05.954 --> 21:07.857
- Bullshit!
- I don't know!

21:13.128 --> 21:17.433
You know, there's a fine
line between being unhelpful

21:17.467 --> 21:19.201
and obstruction of justice.

21:19.234 --> 21:20.803
Now what is that supposed to
mean?

21:20.836 --> 21:21.836
She already told you.

21:22.939 --> 21:24.749
We were investigating Emma's
murder when you were being

21:24.773 --> 21:27.209
loaded into the ambulance
and to prevent having another

21:27.242 --> 21:29.846
dead clansman on our
hands, we followed you.

21:31.247 --> 21:33.583
Really wanna know what happened?

21:33.615 --> 21:35.050
Fine, I'll tell you.

21:35.084 --> 21:37.086
But you're not gonna like it.

21:40.957 --> 21:44.794
A few years ago my boss at
the time had, well still has a

21:44.826 --> 21:48.432
very sick son who is drastically
affected by the radiation.

21:49.731 --> 21:52.167
He had asked me to
infiltrate the elements.

21:52.201 --> 21:53.779
He said he'd heard you were in
possession

21:53.803 --> 21:56.706
of the green stone that
could cure his son.

21:56.739 --> 21:59.142
They knew Emma was the
leader of the Water clan

21:59.174 --> 22:01.610
and knew where I would bump into
her.

22:01.644 --> 22:03.846
I built a relationship to get
in.

22:03.880 --> 22:04.747
You used her?

22:04.779 --> 22:05.714
No.

22:05.748 --> 22:06.682
You used my sister?

22:06.715 --> 22:07.850
No, please hear me out.

22:09.986 --> 22:12.755
I trained hard and emerged
with the ways of the elements.

22:12.788 --> 22:15.692
I learned so much from you about
respect

22:15.724 --> 22:18.227
and honor and about myself.

22:19.261 --> 22:21.830
I really enjoyed living
among the elements so much,

22:21.864 --> 22:23.900
I almost forgot about my
original mission.

22:38.681 --> 22:41.851
But I was soon confronted
with the reality of things.

22:41.884 --> 22:44.053
Although Earth and Grandmaster
permitted me to join

22:44.086 --> 22:46.556
the elements after passing my
initiation,

22:46.588 --> 22:48.791
Earth kept his eyes on me at all
time.

22:55.263 --> 22:56.699
They were always on to me.

23:21.656 --> 23:23.259
I renounced the Four11 and
pledged

23:23.291 --> 23:25.928
my loyalty exclusively to the
elements.

23:26.828 --> 23:29.765
While he did not agree with
my handling of the situation,

23:29.798 --> 23:32.269
he understood that I only
did it for the child.

23:33.202 --> 23:36.306
Earth asked me to keep
the pretense with my boss.

23:36.338 --> 23:38.607
Basically, making me a double
agent,

23:38.641 --> 23:41.111
so he could have access to
the intel on the Four11's.

23:45.314 --> 23:48.250
Lee, my ex-boss was getting
impatient

23:48.284 --> 23:51.254
with my progress and demanded
answers.

23:51.287 --> 23:53.189
I told him he had been wrong.

23:53.221 --> 23:55.591
That the elements didn't
have a green stone.

24:02.365 --> 24:04.800
They had evidence of their own.

24:04.834 --> 24:07.903
They had found out that
I had changed sides.

24:07.936 --> 24:10.072
Traitors are slain.

24:10.105 --> 24:11.273
I was to be executed.

24:24.220 --> 24:26.255
We don't tolerate traitors.

24:26.288 --> 24:28.024
Get him!

25:34.190 --> 25:35.225
Hold it!

25:48.237 --> 25:50.273
Son of a bitch.

25:53.142 --> 25:55.411
Hurts, doesn't it?

25:55.443 --> 25:57.279
But you are strong.

25:58.847 --> 26:01.417
You might actually survive
a beating like this.

26:03.919 --> 26:05.922
That's not a chance I'm willing
to take.

26:08.790 --> 26:12.360
Traitors deserve to die.

26:12.394 --> 26:16.432
- No, no, no.
- Slow and painful.

26:16.464 --> 26:18.134
No.

26:18.166 --> 26:19.167
No!

26:19.201 --> 26:20.435
- And alone!
- No!

26:34.316 --> 26:38.321
There, that oughta do it.

26:47.363 --> 26:49.332
I was sure
as much left for dead,

26:49.365 --> 26:51.201
and I thought I was going to
die.

26:51.967 --> 26:53.036
I wish I was.

26:55.403 --> 26:56.772
Somehow, he saved me.

27:10.318 --> 27:14.257
I wanted to kill everyone
involved in Emma's murder.

27:14.289 --> 27:17.093
But Earth calmed me down
and convinced me to find

27:18.124 --> 27:19.962
her actual killer and
bring him to justice.

27:21.029 --> 27:25.300
You, you are to blame.

27:25.334 --> 27:27.044
If it wasn't for you Emma
would still be alive!

27:27.068 --> 27:28.570
I didn't kill her.

27:28.604 --> 27:32.408
No, I suspect Four11's
were involved, I'm not sure.

27:34.943 --> 27:37.346
And you may have not directly
killed her,

27:38.146 --> 27:43.019
but your selfish ways lead
to her death indirectly.

27:43.051 --> 27:44.051
I...

27:49.258 --> 27:50.559
Enough, enough.

27:55.964 --> 27:56.898
Where are you?

27:56.932 --> 27:57.834
We're nearly there.

27:57.866 --> 27:58.801
We're at the garden.

27:58.835 --> 28:00.078
You still have a long walk
ahead of you.

28:00.102 --> 28:00.970
Don't delay and don't stop.

28:01.002 --> 28:02.504
Not even for rest.

28:02.538 --> 28:05.407
I've sent Gold, Wood and Fire to
you.

28:05.441 --> 28:08.277
They should reach you
soon, but stay alert.

28:08.309 --> 28:10.413
That area isn't safe.

28:10.445 --> 28:12.914
Get to the monastery as soon as
possible.

28:12.948 --> 28:16.953
There was a brutal massacre
here at the Shadows bar.

28:16.986 --> 28:18.387
There is currently reports

28:18.420 --> 28:21.923
of multiple injured and several
dead.

28:21.957 --> 28:23.200
Currently the police have no
leads

28:23.224 --> 28:25.427
on any suspects at this time.

28:25.461 --> 28:28.130
If anyone has any information
regarding this crime,

28:28.163 --> 28:30.299
do not hesitate to contact the
police.

28:49.117 --> 28:50.952
He hasn't talked yet.

28:50.986 --> 28:53.322
Apparently he's got some major
cojones.

28:55.457 --> 28:57.393
It was too easy to track you
down.

28:57.425 --> 29:00.162
Didn't you know we'd
hunt you and find you?

29:00.194 --> 29:01.463
And why aren't you talking now?

29:10.038 --> 29:14.644
We tore apart your bioscanner
and couldn't find the code.

29:14.676 --> 29:16.011
We know you have it.

29:16.045 --> 29:16.946
Where is it?

29:16.979 --> 29:17.979
You'll never find it.

29:18.980 --> 29:20.215
It's not yours to have.

29:20.249 --> 29:21.525
The code belongs to the world
and...

29:21.549 --> 29:24.153
No, the code belongs to Medican.

29:24.185 --> 29:25.387
I developed it.

29:25.421 --> 29:27.390
It's mine to do with as I
please.

29:27.423 --> 29:30.058
Now, that's not what your
contract says.

29:30.092 --> 29:32.395
Medican pays you, therefore
they own your work.

29:32.428 --> 29:34.964
They also pay me so when
fools like you decide

29:34.997 --> 29:36.332
to do something stupid I...

29:36.365 --> 29:38.500
Everyone I the world deserves
the code.

29:38.534 --> 29:40.503
You don't get to decide
who lives and dies.

29:40.536 --> 29:42.138
Sir, there seems to have been
someone

29:42.171 --> 29:44.140
who left the bar before your
arrived.

29:44.173 --> 29:45.942
Well, go track him down.

29:45.974 --> 29:47.042
Yes, sir.

29:54.083 --> 29:55.317
What should I do with him?

29:57.152 --> 29:59.087
Whatever's necessary.

29:59.121 --> 30:00.690
BJ, he's all yours.

30:04.393 --> 30:07.630
Now, now, now.

30:07.663 --> 30:09.632
The game is about to begin.

30:11.066 --> 30:14.037
Where should I start?

30:15.537 --> 30:17.506
No, no, no, no, no,

30:17.538 --> 30:18.641
no, no, no, no,

30:20.209 --> 30:25.280
no!

30:41.730 --> 30:42.730
Here.

30:45.500 --> 30:46.769
Will this still work?

30:46.801 --> 30:48.603
It's been over three days.

30:48.636 --> 30:51.740
Yes, as long as its
been within seven days,

30:51.773 --> 30:55.377
the residual can still be
found through his energy flow.

31:13.662 --> 31:14.663
That was Dave.

31:15.730 --> 31:18.267
It seems the Four11's
have an interest in Cloud.

31:18.299 --> 31:19.667
Why?

31:19.701 --> 31:21.370
No one knows.

31:21.403 --> 31:23.506
But Cloud is now safe with Water
and Dave.

31:23.538 --> 31:26.041
They're heading back to the
warehouse.

31:26.075 --> 31:27.075
We should split up.

31:28.376 --> 31:30.546
Call Earth and report your
findings.

31:30.578 --> 31:32.322
Track the mercenaries,
but keep your distance.

31:32.346 --> 31:33.481
Just observe.

31:33.515 --> 31:34.617
Remember, it's only you.

31:37.152 --> 31:39.788
We'll hunt down the Four11's
and see what they're up to.

31:41.522 --> 31:44.259
What'd Cloud get himself into
this time?

31:44.292 --> 31:47.195
Who knows, but this is huge.

31:47.229 --> 31:49.065
I wonder who this Doc is and why
did he

31:49.097 --> 31:50.399
decide to give a boost to Cloud?

31:51.401 --> 31:54.103
It appears there's more
questions than answers.

32:31.205 --> 32:33.741
Hey Earth, I'm back as you
asked.

32:33.775 --> 32:35.611
Can you tell me what's going on?

32:35.644 --> 32:38.614
It seems that both Four11's and
mercenaries are after Cloud.

32:38.646 --> 32:39.781
No one seems to know why.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.786
I think it's happening.

32:43.818 --> 32:47.222
Everything that we've been
training for is coming to a head,

32:47.256 --> 32:49.725
and somehow Cloud's the key.

32:50.726 --> 32:52.394
Whoa.

32:52.426 --> 32:55.230
And we don't even know
who killed Water yet.

32:55.263 --> 32:58.266
Wait, Water's dead?

32:58.299 --> 33:02.204
No, Water's sister Emma,
the previous Clan leader.

33:03.939 --> 33:06.642
It's be so long I had nearly
forgotten that she filled in.

33:07.843 --> 33:08.878
Yeah.

33:09.979 --> 33:14.383
Find out who these mercenaries
are, but be careful.

33:15.384 --> 33:16.684
I'm good.

33:16.718 --> 33:20.223
Don't worry about me.

33:30.632 --> 33:32.468
Is something troubling you,
Earth?

33:34.736 --> 33:36.639
I think our clan may
have gotten involved

33:36.672 --> 33:38.374
in the current political
turmoil.

33:40.509 --> 33:42.545
But we may be the only
ones to save them all.

33:44.479 --> 33:47.615
Sometime one needs
to intervene to correct

33:47.648 --> 33:52.687
not only one's path, but for
all to seek a better path.

34:38.634 --> 34:41.268
Yen, it's good seeing you again.

34:41.302 --> 34:42.770
Welcome home.

34:42.804 --> 34:43.804
It's been a while.

34:45.007 --> 34:46.708
She's expecting you.

34:46.742 --> 34:47.742
This way.

34:55.516 --> 34:56.516
Hello, Yen.

34:57.485 --> 34:59.654
I hear you have vital news?

35:01.023 --> 35:04.293
Doc may have given the code to
Neil.

35:04.326 --> 35:05.860
No.

35:05.893 --> 35:09.497
So the one who not only failed
to find the green stone,

35:09.530 --> 35:13.402
but turned against us
now stands in our way.

35:14.969 --> 35:16.771
Great.

35:16.804 --> 35:19.607
He's caused many problems
dragging the elements into this.

35:19.641 --> 35:23.846
By turning his back on his
mission, on me.

35:23.878 --> 35:26.447
I want that code at any cost.

35:26.481 --> 35:28.784
My son's life depends on it.

35:28.817 --> 35:31.554
Word has it you're good at what
you do.

35:32.788 --> 35:34.389
Prove it.

35:34.422 --> 35:36.457
Doc and Neil may have since
parted ways.

35:36.490 --> 35:38.494
Doc may be in the hands of
mercenaries.

35:40.362 --> 35:43.266
Well, perhaps we should
follow both the Doc and Neil.

35:44.099 --> 35:47.702
We need to find the code
before it's too late.

35:48.637 --> 35:51.039
There's no telling who
has it at this point.

35:52.641 --> 35:54.009
Agreed.

35:54.041 --> 35:56.478
Yen, you check with Doc
and the mercenaries.

35:56.510 --> 35:58.012
They might have him captive.

35:58.045 --> 36:00.848
Lee, track down the traitor.

36:00.882 --> 36:02.284
Find Neil.

36:03.385 --> 36:04.420
Now!

36:53.434 --> 36:57.005
<i>♪ He thinks you're ignorant I

36:57.038 --> 36:58.773

37:14.456 --> 37:16.525
Keep your distance from the
elements.

37:16.557 --> 37:17.934
We're neutral and don't want any
trouble,

37:17.958 --> 37:20.128
but we will take a stand
if your provoke us.

37:21.663 --> 37:23.498
You think you're a match for
my men?

37:23.532 --> 37:25.634
You don't wanna know
what we're capable of.

37:25.666 --> 37:28.136
Lay off of Cloud or we're
gonna be forced to intervene.

37:28.170 --> 37:30.172
Is that a threat?

37:30.204 --> 37:32.540
You think we're joking?

37:32.574 --> 37:33.876
Try us.

37:33.909 --> 37:35.744
Another empty threat.

37:35.777 --> 37:37.512
We have weapons of mass
destruction against

37:37.545 --> 37:40.014
your tiny hands and swords.

37:41.882 --> 37:44.719
We also have guns.

37:47.521 --> 37:49.592
Do you think we get
intimidated very easily?

37:50.925 --> 37:53.628
So what do you
want with Cloud anyway?

37:53.661 --> 37:56.398
You know that bar that's
been on the television lately?

37:57.231 --> 37:59.067
<i>♪ It's an illusion,
he's here ♪</i>

37:59.099 --> 38:02.170
I was hired to track
this guy they call Doc.

38:02.204 --> 38:04.840
He used to work for the
people that hired me.

38:04.873 --> 38:06.508
Used to?

38:06.541 --> 38:08.218
Well, he ran off and
stole some proprietary

38:08.242 --> 38:10.112
technology that wasn't his to
take.

38:10.144 --> 38:12.079
So what does this have to do
with Cloud?

38:12.112 --> 38:13.881
Someone else was also tracking
him.

38:13.914 --> 38:15.784
The Four11's were also at the
bar.

38:16.485 --> 38:19.088
Someone took them out,
but they left them alive.

38:21.155 --> 38:23.157
I thought the news said
there were no survivors?

38:23.190 --> 38:24.926
Everyone was dead when I got
there.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.728
Except for the Four11's.

38:26.760 --> 38:29.831
I figure, why not let them take
the fall?

38:29.864 --> 38:32.467
What do you know of Cloud's
involvement in all this?

38:32.501 --> 38:34.703
I suspect he was also tracking
Doc

38:35.536 --> 38:38.239
or maybe he just happened
to be at the wrong place

38:38.273 --> 38:40.443
at the wrong time, but I doubt
that.

38:42.510 --> 38:44.512
Do you know his whereabouts?

38:44.545 --> 38:46.448
The bar,
that's all we know.

38:47.849 --> 38:49.651
Maybe we could work together.

38:49.684 --> 38:52.621
I just wanna retrieve that
stolen piece of technology.

38:52.653 --> 38:54.889
That'd be something
we discuss with Earth.

38:54.922 --> 38:57.992
Either way, we're not giving
up any of our members.

38:58.025 --> 38:59.594
That's out of the question.

38:59.628 --> 39:01.230
<i>♪ Weak and strong, I know ♪</i>

39:01.262 --> 39:05.634
What if I told you I had
some discerning information

39:05.666 --> 39:06.869
regarding one of your members.

39:06.902 --> 39:07.902
You're bluffing.

39:08.869 --> 39:10.672
<i>♪ So you can be humble ♪</i>

39:10.704 --> 39:11.706
Who?

39:11.739 --> 39:12.807
The one you call Water.

39:12.840 --> 39:13.842
She's perfectly fine.

39:13.875 --> 39:14.875
Is she though?

39:16.077 --> 39:18.113
What do you know about her?

39:18.146 --> 39:19.715
Plenty.

39:19.748 --> 39:21.617
We're still investigating that
matter.

39:21.650 --> 39:23.561
I highly doubt you'd have
anything to contribute.

39:23.585 --> 39:24.995
He doesn't have anything
we don't already know.

39:25.019 --> 39:26.554
<i>♪ I'm good at ♪</i>

39:26.588 --> 39:28.190
<i>♪ I doubt it ♪</i>

39:28.222 --> 39:31.860
<i>♪ I'm here to deliver the news ♪</i>

39:31.893 --> 39:34.028
<i>♪ And you need my advice ♪</i>

39:34.061 --> 39:35.130
Well.

39:35.829 --> 39:38.065
So what is it you want with
Cloud?

39:38.099 --> 39:41.303
He and Doc must have linked
up at the bar and then slipped

39:41.335 --> 39:44.605
him the stolen piece of
technology without him knowing.

39:44.639 --> 39:46.708
So how would he know
if he has this on him?

39:46.740 --> 39:47.740
He wouldn't.

39:49.744 --> 39:51.313
So, what can you offer me?

39:53.581 --> 39:55.250
So Neil is in the middle of
all this.

39:55.282 --> 39:57.219
I have to find him before they
do.

40:14.702 --> 40:15.979
<i>♪ Tonight I'm going to the party ♪</i>

40:16.003 --> 40:17.873
Well, guess who that was?

40:26.681 --> 40:29.284
You know the more I think
about it,

40:29.317 --> 40:31.653
the more I think the Four11's
killed Emma.

40:32.653 --> 40:33.922
I don't think so.

40:33.954 --> 40:35.023
How do you know?

40:35.657 --> 40:38.059
Are you covering for your
friends?

40:38.092 --> 40:39.795
They're not my friends.

40:39.827 --> 40:40.827
They never were.

40:42.896 --> 40:44.199
Yeah right.

40:44.231 --> 40:46.367
It was just a job.

40:46.400 --> 40:49.170
And my sister was part of the
job?

40:49.204 --> 40:51.006
You know, maybe you killed her.

40:51.039 --> 40:52.074
I could never.

40:52.606 --> 40:55.677
The elements are the only family
I have.

40:55.710 --> 40:56.710
I don't trust you.

40:58.146 --> 40:59.381
That's in the past.

40:59.414 --> 41:00.616
And so is my sister.

41:03.385 --> 41:04.319
They're here.

41:04.351 --> 41:05.853
- Who?
- The Four11's.

41:08.056 --> 41:09.992
We have to keep moving.

41:10.025 --> 41:11.126
Let's go.

41:31.980 --> 41:34.682
Surrender
the one you call Cloud.

41:34.715 --> 41:35.992
I thought you cut ties with
these guys?

41:36.016 --> 41:37.819
Doesn't look like it, now does
it?

41:39.253 --> 41:40.255
Who are you?

41:44.059 --> 41:46.261
TJ, what happened to you?

41:47.862 --> 41:49.331
Friendships come at a cost,
Neil.

41:50.798 --> 41:52.209
Especially when your friend
betrays you

41:52.233 --> 41:53.369
and defects to the enemy.

41:57.204 --> 41:59.240
TJ, I'm sorry.

41:59.273 --> 42:01.042
I'll show you sorry.

43:05.974 --> 43:08.177
Let's go!

43:20.221 --> 43:22.925
I think he's running a fever.

43:28.829 --> 43:30.931
Take him to the monastery.

43:30.965 --> 43:32.800
His bioscanner's not working
properly.

43:40.541 --> 43:44.813
Gold, you said the Doc slipped
him something in your vision?

43:46.981 --> 43:50.886
Wood, Fire, follow the
mercenaries.

43:50.918 --> 43:52.788
They more than likely have Doc.

43:52.820 --> 43:54.288
Find out what Doc did to Cloud.

43:57.458 --> 44:02.297
Gold, follow the Four11,
but do not engage.

44:03.331 --> 44:04.331
They outnumber you.

44:18.278 --> 44:21.215
If it's worth anything,
Emma meant a lot to me.

44:21.248 --> 44:23.317
Don't you ever mention her
again.

44:23.351 --> 44:24.986
You are not worthy to speak of
her,

44:25.018 --> 44:26.287
let alone say her name.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.456
Guys, guys just stop it already.

44:28.489 --> 44:29.990
We need to get Cloud to the base

44:30.023 --> 44:31.463
so we can him some medical
attention.

44:31.492 --> 44:34.229
Why don't we
just leave him to die?

44:34.262 --> 44:36.898
Look, regardless of
what you might think,

44:36.931 --> 44:38.567
I didn't kill your sister.

44:38.599 --> 44:40.902
You might as well have.

44:40.934 --> 44:43.103
You may have not laid a hand on
her,

44:43.137 --> 44:44.405
but I blame you just the same.

44:44.438 --> 44:46.574
Just stop it already, that's
enough.

44:46.608 --> 44:48.210
What's done is done.

44:48.242 --> 44:50.411
We can't change the past.

44:50.445 --> 44:51.445
Let it go.

44:52.646 --> 44:53.914
Okay.

44:53.947 --> 44:54.947
Let's rest here.

44:55.784 --> 44:59.086
- Conserve your energy.
- All right, okay.

45:07.094 --> 45:08.163
He's ours.

45:30.284 --> 45:31.619
Jump.

45:31.652 --> 45:33.187
It's me.

45:35.088 --> 45:36.157
Go, I got this.

45:51.672 --> 45:52.907
Anytime now.

46:21.135 --> 46:22.471
Hey punk!

46:52.367 --> 46:53.368
Damn!

46:53.400 --> 46:55.136
Water, can you hear me?

46:57.070 --> 46:58.139
Wind?

46:59.239 --> 47:00.308
Damn.

47:07.014 --> 47:09.350
Neil, you seem lost.

47:11.018 --> 47:12.052
Come with us.

47:12.085 --> 47:13.154
We'll show you the way.

47:15.188 --> 47:16.457
I appreciate the offer,

47:16.490 --> 47:19.226
- but I think I'll pass.
- We insist.

47:24.664 --> 47:26.400
Get off me.

47:28.769 --> 47:31.038
I don't think you understand.

47:31.072 --> 47:32.374
I'm not giving you a choice.

47:32.407 --> 47:33.475
You're coming with us.

47:35.275 --> 47:36.344
Come on.

47:55.329 --> 47:56.498
Gonna rethink that offer?

49:17.577 --> 49:19.313
You picked the wrong side.

49:19.347 --> 49:20.448
How would you know?

49:20.481 --> 49:21.483
You left us.

49:21.516 --> 49:23.318
I had my reasons.

49:23.351 --> 49:25.119
I thought you were better than
that.

49:56.250 --> 49:57.385
Took you long enough.

49:59.186 --> 50:02.190
Next time, don't wait for a
dramatic entrance to show up.

50:02.222 --> 50:02.856
Try calling.

50:02.889 --> 50:04.391
I did.

50:04.425 --> 50:07.195
My bioscanner must be
malfunctioning.

50:07.228 --> 50:11.199
I think it's effected by
whatever's happening to me.

50:11.231 --> 50:12.333
Oh, let's keep moving.

50:13.534 --> 50:14.869
This way toward the lake.

50:14.902 --> 50:16.604
Wind and our clansmen are
waiting for us.

50:16.637 --> 50:18.715
I have to go report to my
clan before things get worse.

50:18.739 --> 50:20.441
I'll meet you at the monastery.

50:41.429 --> 50:42.429
This is the one.

50:52.974 --> 50:54.943
Hey Cloud, long time no see.

50:55.742 --> 50:58.445
Looks like time hasn't
been very good to you.

50:58.478 --> 51:00.447
Hey, Dave, I'll take it from
here.

51:00.481 --> 51:01.883
Brief me before we go to help
Water.

51:01.916 --> 51:03.552
All right.

51:12.525 --> 51:15.663
Let's get outta here
before the storm roles in.

51:15.695 --> 51:16.764
Yes sir, where to?

51:18.298 --> 51:21.603
To the monastery.

51:52.365 --> 51:53.400
Something wrong?

51:57.003 --> 51:58.405
Dave told me everything.

52:01.474 --> 52:03.411
Just what were you doing at that
bar?

52:04.978 --> 52:06.380
I can't remember much.

52:09.449 --> 52:12.052
Just having a drink,
minding my own business.

52:12.085 --> 52:15.022
No I mean, what were you
doing there in the first place?

52:15.056 --> 52:16.858
Were you there to meet Four11?

52:16.891 --> 52:18.693
Ha, yeah, funny.

52:20.628 --> 52:22.631
No, I just wanted to be alone
and think.

52:23.864 --> 52:25.867
And Four11 just happened to be
there?

52:27.367 --> 52:31.405
Well, this nerdy guy
comes walking to the bar

52:33.574 --> 52:36.411
wearing this trench coat and
sunglasses.

52:37.244 --> 52:40.614
Now odd thing was, he never took
'em off,

52:42.048 --> 52:43.418
even in the darkened bar.

52:47.588 --> 52:48.757
And he was kinda nervous.

52:50.458 --> 52:54.729
Then Four11 enter, walk directly
to him.

52:56.563 --> 52:59.333
They must've known him too
because they called him Doc.

53:00.400 --> 53:03.404
And then they start bullying
on the guy, harassing him.

53:05.539 --> 53:08.576
I had to do something, so
I jumped in to save him.

53:09.844 --> 53:11.979
You just had to get involved.

53:12.012 --> 53:13.548
I had to do something.

53:13.581 --> 53:15.425
I couldn't just let them
beat the crap outta the guy.

53:15.449 --> 53:17.418
He even gave me a booster in the
fight.

53:26.527 --> 53:28.463
Gotta grab a few more
things before we go.

53:28.496 --> 53:29.496
All right.

53:36.737 --> 53:38.405
What happened to Doc?

53:39.940 --> 53:42.476
He must've ran off during the
fight.

53:42.510 --> 53:44.512
I chased after him, but he was
long gone.

53:56.556 --> 53:58.759
Let's pick up the pace.

53:58.793 --> 54:01.095
Last thing I wanna do is
pick up pieces of Cloud.

54:01.128 --> 54:02.896
Yeah, yeah, real funny.

54:03.630 --> 54:07.434
Neil or should I call you Cloud?

54:08.969 --> 54:11.438
You're absolutely glowing.

54:12.606 --> 54:14.075
The epitome of health.

54:15.175 --> 54:18.112
Ah, ah, leaving so soon?

54:18.144 --> 54:20.014
We're leaving fashionably early.

54:20.047 --> 54:21.449
With the guest of honor?

54:22.750 --> 54:24.050
It's not gonna happen.

54:24.083 --> 54:25.819
Why do you want him so bad?

54:25.853 --> 54:27.521
Why's he so important to you?

54:27.554 --> 54:30.590
Him, after everything that
he's done?

54:30.623 --> 54:32.926
Especially after what he did to
my men.

54:34.994 --> 54:37.097
But I see karma's already gotten
to him.

54:40.201 --> 54:41.436
Stay back.

54:42.902 --> 54:45.138
Why are you trying to protect
him?

54:45.172 --> 54:47.842
Because he's one of the
elements.

54:47.875 --> 54:48.943
He's one of us.

57:18.659 --> 57:20.929
Go, run, I'll hold them off.

57:24.130 --> 57:25.165
Bolo.

57:26.400 --> 57:27.400
Take care of this.

57:33.806 --> 57:35.041
Shoot.

57:35.074 --> 57:37.210
It's your lucky day.

57:37.244 --> 57:38.246
Let's get outta here.

58:13.713 --> 58:15.382
Let's join forces.

58:15.416 --> 58:17.985
We've worked together before,
we can work together again.

58:18.018 --> 58:19.887
And just what's in
it for the rest of us?

58:19.920 --> 58:23.124
You can help us find the Doc
and we can share the intel.

58:23.157 --> 58:25.059
Oh, just like the time you
delivered us

58:25.092 --> 58:26.994
Doc's lab assistant, Emma?

58:27.027 --> 58:28.429
We kept our end of the deal.

58:28.461 --> 58:30.797
She is also a member of the
elements.

58:31.532 --> 58:33.800
You chose to squander the
opportunity.

58:33.833 --> 58:35.101
She was useless.

58:35.135 --> 58:38.206
She had nothing and neither do
you.

59:07.266 --> 59:09.769
Disable their GPS features.

59:09.802 --> 59:12.440
We don't want anyone tracing
their bio signs here.

59:26.820 --> 59:28.055
Well, well, gentlemen.

59:28.088 --> 59:29.457
What do we have here?

59:29.489 --> 59:31.192
What are you doing here, hm?

59:32.291 --> 59:34.295
What did you do with Doc?

59:34.327 --> 59:37.898
He outlived his
usefulness, just like Yen,

59:37.931 --> 59:41.367
just like Emma, or what was
it you called her, Water?

59:43.269 --> 59:45.706
I'd say the same of you, but
you were never useful to us.

59:47.039 --> 59:48.275
Let us deal with him.

59:49.443 --> 59:50.443
You!

01:00:22.442 --> 01:00:24.144
When did this begin?

01:00:24.177 --> 01:00:25.921
Ever since I helped that
guy they call the Doc.

01:00:25.945 --> 01:00:29.048
He escaped the Four11
from the bar that night.

01:00:30.483 --> 01:00:33.353
He gave me a booster shot and
it's been

01:00:33.387 --> 01:00:35.289
screwing with me ever since.

01:00:35.322 --> 01:00:36.891
Booster shot, where?

01:00:47.867 --> 01:00:49.269
I don't think that was a
booster.

01:00:50.871 --> 01:00:52.481
That's probably what's
messing with your bioscanner.

01:00:52.505 --> 01:00:54.541
It's probably why
everyone's been after him.

01:00:54.574 --> 01:00:56.210
Let them have him.

01:00:56.242 --> 01:00:58.045
Water, you're outta line.

01:00:58.077 --> 01:00:59.112
Am I?

01:00:59.679 --> 01:01:01.080
Why didn't you tell the rest of
us

01:01:01.114 --> 01:01:02.483
that he was part of the
Four11's?

01:01:04.083 --> 01:01:06.386
So, you know?

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:09.190
Did you think I wouldn't
figure it out?

01:01:09.222 --> 01:01:11.458
She was my sister.

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:13.092
Four11's are close.

01:01:13.126 --> 01:01:14.126
We gotta get moving.

01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:33.213
It's the code.

01:01:33.246 --> 01:01:34.882
A code that was engineered in a
lab

01:01:34.914 --> 01:01:37.250
to produce clean air once
release.

01:01:37.284 --> 01:01:40.186
Doc injected it into him at the
bar.

01:01:40.219 --> 01:01:42.522
It's not meant for an
individual.

01:01:42.556 --> 01:01:45.592
Which is why Neil's
bioscanner is overloading.

01:01:45.626 --> 01:01:46.626
He's dying.

01:01:47.894 --> 01:01:49.329
You killed my sister.

01:01:49.362 --> 01:01:51.865
I don't seem to recall
that, young woman.

01:01:51.898 --> 01:01:53.601
She and I had an agreement.

01:01:53.634 --> 01:01:56.436
We discovered she worked in
the lab and we had an agreement

01:01:56.469 --> 01:01:58.304
that she would smuggle
the code out for us.

01:01:58.338 --> 01:02:00.575
Why would she even agree
to work with you guys?

01:02:02.275 --> 01:02:05.144
Young woman, your
sister acted honorably.

01:02:05.177 --> 01:02:07.313
I don't mean to imply otherwise.

01:02:07.347 --> 01:02:10.084
She understood we needed
the code for the sake

01:02:10.117 --> 01:02:13.586
of my son's life, as well as
everyone's.

01:02:13.619 --> 01:02:16.623
She told me her lab found a
cure and she agreed to retrieve

01:02:16.657 --> 01:02:20.361
it for us and when we heard on
the news that a woman's body

01:02:20.393 --> 01:02:23.129
was found by the river, we
knew that must've been her.

01:02:24.563 --> 01:02:27.100
His chi is running erratically.

01:02:27.134 --> 01:02:28.469
We must act quickly.

01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:30.237
I can help before it gets worse.

01:02:35.474 --> 01:02:36.911
- Sit down.
- You sure?

01:02:36.943 --> 01:02:38.913
- Sit down, relax.
- Hello, Neil.

01:02:38.945 --> 01:02:41.347
- Call to your chi.
- Here, now?

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:43.449
It's okay, it's okay.

01:02:43.483 --> 01:02:45.085
You're among friends, Neil.

01:02:45.117 --> 01:02:46.320
All has been forgiven.

01:02:53.159 --> 01:02:54.994
We should take him with us.

01:02:55.027 --> 01:02:57.997
The sooner we extract the
code the faster he will heal,

01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:00.067
and the quicker we can produce
clean air.

01:03:01.434 --> 01:03:04.471
No, he's meditating.

01:03:04.503 --> 01:03:06.206
He can't be moved.

01:03:06.239 --> 01:03:07.574
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:03:10.277 --> 01:03:11.545
So be it.

01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:18.346
Cloud stays with us.

01:04:20.246 --> 01:04:22.482
There's a reason the Doc
didn't give your men the code.

01:04:34.594 --> 01:04:36.329
Sorry, I couldn't.

01:04:45.672 --> 01:04:46.740
No, no!

01:04:49.108 --> 01:04:50.177
You're okay.

01:04:51.143 --> 01:04:52.645
You're gonna be okay.

01:04:52.679 --> 01:04:54.347
We're gonna get the code
finally.

01:04:56.315 --> 01:04:58.618
Soon you'll be with our son.

01:04:59.619 --> 01:05:03.289
Both happy and healthy.

01:05:26.313 --> 01:05:28.449
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

01:05:28.481 --> 01:05:29.481
Hand him over.

01:05:34.353 --> 01:05:36.089
What a spirit.

01:05:36.123 --> 01:05:38.692
You can always join your
friend, the one you call Gold.

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:41.162
Where is Gold?

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.362
Dead.

01:05:43.396 --> 01:05:44.798
Who killed him, you?

01:05:46.666 --> 01:05:48.168
No.

01:05:48.201 --> 01:05:49.670
That would be us.

01:05:50.737 --> 01:05:51.771
You?

01:05:51.804 --> 01:05:52.804
You?

01:05:54.273 --> 01:05:56.543
Have fun boys, play nice.

01:05:58.711 --> 01:06:00.246
Traitors.

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.850
And why should we be so loyal?

01:06:02.882 --> 01:06:05.151
This pays far better than
hanging out

01:06:05.184 --> 01:06:06.619
with a bunch of do-gooders.

01:06:06.652 --> 01:06:08.321
After everything Earth
and the Grandmaster

01:06:08.355 --> 01:06:09.690
has done for you.

01:06:09.722 --> 01:06:11.525
Did you hear that?

01:06:11.557 --> 01:06:14.894
Remind us, what all has he
done for us besides nothing?

01:06:14.927 --> 01:06:17.163
Except for the occasional
bruising.

01:09:37.063 --> 01:09:39.800
You two will pay for your
disloyalty.

01:09:41.434 --> 01:09:42.434
Loyalty?

01:09:43.435 --> 01:09:45.572
You lost our loyalty long ago.

01:09:45.604 --> 01:09:46.805
How?

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.041
Why?

01:09:48.073 --> 01:09:49.542
Why?

01:09:49.576 --> 01:09:51.011
Why when we can have billions.

01:09:51.042 --> 01:09:54.747
We can decide who gets clean
air or not.

01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:56.716
That's not the way of the
element.

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:58.952
That's not how you were taught.

01:09:58.984 --> 01:10:02.121
Dude, we're just tired of
being poor.

01:10:02.154 --> 01:10:04.690
Dude, did you just dude me?

01:10:04.724 --> 01:10:06.694
You have no one to blame but
yourself.

01:10:07.493 --> 01:10:09.095
- Me?
- That's right.

01:10:09.128 --> 01:10:10.872
We just happened to
walk past your office when

01:10:10.896 --> 01:10:13.667
Water was telling you
about her work at the lab.

01:10:13.699 --> 01:10:15.402
You were a fool to pass on

01:10:15.435 --> 01:10:16.970
such a lucrative opportunity.

01:10:17.002 --> 01:10:18.838
So we cut a deal
with Marcus to retrieve

01:10:18.872 --> 01:10:21.441
the intel and split the funds.

01:10:21.474 --> 01:10:23.710
We informed
Marcus the moment she left.

01:10:23.743 --> 01:10:26.480
And the rest made the nightly
news.

01:10:28.014 --> 01:10:30.550
If she only cooperated,
she'd still be alive,

01:10:30.582 --> 01:10:33.085
but she wouldn't give up her
research.

01:10:33.118 --> 01:10:34.688
It's a shame.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:38.157
So Marcus had to do what he
had to do.

01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:40.926
All this time I thought
it was Cloud to blame.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.863
It was you two weasels?

01:10:42.895 --> 01:10:45.765
Oh so rich watching
you these last few years.

01:10:45.798 --> 01:10:48.469
Especially when you never
suspected us.

01:10:49.868 --> 01:10:51.837
Medican's not gonna let
you get away with this.

01:10:51.871 --> 01:10:53.740
They're gonna send somebody for
the code.

01:10:55.041 --> 01:10:56.576
Don't worry about Medican.

01:10:56.609 --> 01:10:58.011
They're closed for business.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.389
Now it's your turn to die.

01:14:52.845 --> 01:14:54.748
Contact your clan, we're gonna
need

01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:56.181
help getting outta here.

01:14:56.215 --> 01:14:59.119
Well, looks like Cloud
saved the day, again.

01:14:59.152 --> 01:15:00.354
Oh, shut up.

01:15:05.725 --> 01:15:07.927
Medican's been
liquidated and they left us

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.895
with their greatest asset.

01:15:09.929 --> 01:15:13.432
The Earth is regenerating
clean air now, albeit slowly,

01:15:13.466 --> 01:15:15.802
but still scientists estimate
it'll only

01:15:15.835 --> 01:15:18.404
take about a year for total
recovery.

01:15:18.438 --> 01:15:21.341
The code was delivered and
implemented successfully.

01:15:21.373 --> 01:15:24.744
Free as a settlement
with the defunct Medican.

01:16:42.287 --> 01:16:43.389
Hey Cloud.

01:16:44.123 --> 01:16:45.858
Long time no see.

01:16:45.891 --> 01:16:47.493
We do have lines here, but
that's cool.

01:16:47.527 --> 01:16:48.927
Oh.

01:16:50.061 --> 01:16:52.097
I'm cold, I wanna get in.

01:16:52.131 --> 01:16:53.131
Action!

01:16:55.434 --> 01:16:56.436
- No ax.
- No ax!

01:16:56.469 --> 01:16:59.404
No!

01:16:59.438 --> 01:17:02.141
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

01:17:02.175 --> 01:17:04.409
- I think that's good.
- Way to give it everything.

01:17:04.443 --> 01:17:05.945
Cut.

01:17:27.199 --> 01:17:29.501
I was fine with that.

01:17:39.244 --> 01:17:41.314
Let's go, come on!

01:17:46.219 --> 01:17:49.122
TJ, what happened to you?

01:17:50.189 --> 01:17:51.490
So you the Doc?

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:56.162
You left it, oh, what's this?

01:17:56.194 --> 01:17:57.831
I see you took it off already
for us.

01:17:57.863 --> 01:17:59.165
I see, thank you.

01:18:00.632 --> 01:18:01.533
- You gotta be...
- Cut.

01:18:01.567 --> 01:18:03.136
And action.

01:18:11.877 --> 01:18:12.978
Keep going.

01:18:22.287 --> 01:18:23.287
Three, go.

01:18:26.492 --> 01:18:27.527
Three.

01:18:29.662 --> 01:18:32.365
We need to see your face.

01:18:33.532 --> 01:18:34.333
Medic!

01:18:34.367 --> 01:18:35.935
Pardon me?

01:18:35.967 --> 01:18:37.237
Used to.

01:18:39.971 --> 01:18:41.006
Let me run that back.

01:18:43.542 --> 01:18:44.978
Go.

01:18:48.447 --> 01:18:49.515
Mother.

01:18:49.547 --> 01:18:50.983
Why you all get your a...

01:18:51.016 --> 01:18:53.052
Come on, go.

01:18:58.457 --> 01:18:59.457
Go ahead.

01:19:00.659 --> 01:19:02.895
It's locked, what the?

01:19:04.663 --> 01:19:06.198
So what can you offer me?

01:19:15.006 --> 01:19:16.675
Absolutely nothing,
say it.

01:19:19.612 --> 01:19:22.414
And when we heard on the news.

01:19:23.649 --> 01:19:25.652
Quiet on set.

01:19:28.587 --> 01:19:29.587
Go ahead.
