01:25.085 --> 01:26.665
Griffin. Griffin.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.959
- Griffin, what did I say?
- I'm in the middle of a game.

01:30.007 --> 01:32.547
You can't play that in the car
unless you take your Dramamine.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.013
It's too late for Dramamine.
We're practically there.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.263
Don't roll your eyes at me.

01:36.305 --> 01:37.765
You want him puking in the car again?

01:37.806 --> 01:39.516
- I said I was sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.

01:39.558 --> 01:40.928
That was smelly.

01:40.976 --> 01:43.726
- Was not! It was only an accident.
- Nobody's blaming you, honeybun.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.810
It was smelly.

01:44.855 --> 01:45.865
I'm following the GPS.

01:45.898 --> 01:46.938
It stinked.

01:46.982 --> 01:48.362
Look, she says left on Kitty Hawk.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.530
No, no, Dad.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.068
- There's no way we can live here.
- Oh, come on.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.823
You haven't even seen the house yet.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.374
- There are power lines.
- Relax.

01:55.407 --> 01:56.777
I can feel the tumors forming already.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.405
No one's getting tumors.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.252
- What tumors?
- It's a joke.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.327
Dumbass.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.711
It's a joke, dumbass!

02:02.748 --> 02:03.958
Don't say that, sweetie.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.789
Make a U-turn in 50 feet.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.093
What?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.917
- You missed the turn?
- Yes, ma'am.

02:08.961 --> 02:12.802
Dumbass. Whee!

02:38.116 --> 02:39.486
Come on.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.083
Nice, right?

02:46.124 --> 02:47.134
Yeah.

02:47.626 --> 02:48.786
Cozy.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.246
I think it's nice.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.085
I think it's nice, too.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.210
Piggy-corn, too.

02:53.257 --> 02:54.467
Mr. and Mrs. Bowen.

02:54.508 --> 02:58.088
Hi. Sorry we're late.
We missed that turn on Kitty Hawk.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.255
Yeah, modern technology.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.965
She's just gonna go right in,
start checking it out.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.016
That hoop is cool.

03:07.479 --> 03:08.939
Nice tree, huh?

03:08.981 --> 03:11.611
That's been here longer
than any of the houses.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.070
Be fun to climb.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.780
- Mom, there's a kitchen!
- Oh, wow.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.111
I'm gonna go see my bedroom!

03:17.155 --> 03:18.945
Slow down, please, on the stairs.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.281
That security system works.

03:20.325 --> 03:24.285
The owner was a bit of a technophile,
so this house is wired for whatever you might need.

03:24.329 --> 03:28.379
You'll notice he put speakers in all of the walls,
so you can hear music in every room...

03:28.417 --> 03:29.417
including the john.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.005
So, this is the kitchen through here.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.125
- Do you wanna see this?
- Sure.

03:34.173 --> 03:36.223
Will either of you two
be commuting to work?

03:36.258 --> 03:39.138
Not me. I'll be home with the kids.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.298
- Amy is an amazing writer.
- Oh, Eric!

03:41.346 --> 03:42.676
- She is.
- Come on!

03:42.723 --> 03:44.813
She's being very humble right now.
She's very good.

03:44.850 --> 03:48.730
I'm trying to be, but you know,
it's just hard to find the time.

03:49.688 --> 03:51.478
I know, believe me,
I have two of my own.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.483
They're in college.
I'm glad they're gone.

03:54.526 --> 03:57.146
I mean, I'm getting my life back.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.991
Where did you say that you worked,
Mr. Bowen?

04:00.032 --> 04:02.992
John Deere corporate, over in Moline.

04:03.035 --> 04:04.165
That's a wonderful company.

04:04.203 --> 04:07.663
We have a riding mower.
It's lasted us for years. We love John Deere.

04:07.706 --> 04:11.786
Well, I'd be very flattered right now
if I hadn't gotten laid off.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.455
- I'm sorry. I didn't realize...
- That's all right.

04:13.504 --> 04:16.803
They do have a quality... mower.
It's fine.

04:16.839 --> 04:17.839
They do, but...

04:17.882 --> 04:19.803
They were making some cutbacks,
and I was...

04:19.843 --> 04:22.473
Hey, Eric, come look at this.

04:22.513 --> 04:25.933
I'd love to, honey, but I'm in the middle of a
very awkward exchange with our realtor right now.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.024
Come see.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.689
Is that all right?

04:28.727 --> 04:30.937
- Don't go anywhere.
- Please.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.145
- Look, there's a field down there.
- Oh, hey.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.861
- Whose property is that?
- That's city property.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.402
That's a good place for a brushfire.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.739
You have to try to like this.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.575
Okay. I'll try.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.545
Would you like to see the upstairs?

04:48.580 --> 04:49.910
Yes, I would.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.248
And this is a master
that you're showing us?

04:53.293 --> 04:54.753
That's correct.

04:56.588 --> 04:57.878
How is it up there, kiddo?

04:57.923 --> 04:59.263
I like our house better.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.339
Well, that's not an option, honey.

05:02.386 --> 05:05.346
You can call that a bedroom,
but really, it's an attic.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.389
That can be where Griffin sleeps.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.060
This place has so much light.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.403
Huh, Eric?

05:12.938 --> 05:13.938
Very nice.

05:14.523 --> 05:15.573
Yeah.

05:15.607 --> 05:16.897
Very nice.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.192
The house faces...

05:19.236 --> 05:22.066
Yeah, it's a little bit quiet
on this side of the street...

05:22.114 --> 05:25.454
but just one block up,
things are starting to fill up.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.949
It's funny. Yeah.

05:31.290 --> 05:32.620
Piggy-corn?

05:36.086 --> 05:38.416
No, Piggy-corn's not my baby.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.713
She's just a doll.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.756
She's half-pig and half-unicorn, see?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.180
She has a little horn.
Honk, honk.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.969
Who are you talking to?

05:47.973 --> 05:49.393
No one.

05:50.142 --> 05:52.642
Mom, we like this house!

06:23.008 --> 06:24.798
Jesus, this is really stuck.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.683
That's probably just moisture.
It rained last week.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.305
Okay. Well, I don't know.

06:33.352 --> 06:35.562
All the houses are like this
in our price range.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.734
And this is the least sucky one
we've seen...

06:37.773 --> 06:39.903
- so I think, maybe...
- Maybe?

06:39.942 --> 06:44.112
Okay, look. Foreclosures have
hit this neighborhood really hard.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.324
There's some wiggle room on the price.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.699
How much wiggle we talking?

06:55.541 --> 06:57.001
Come on, man!

06:57.042 --> 06:58.172
Sorry.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.167
Perfect.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.132
Buck up, kiddo. It's temporary.

07:03.382 --> 07:04.882
We've ruined your life.

07:04.925 --> 07:05.975
Good.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.219
Yay!

07:11.098 --> 07:12.718
Hey, hey, hey.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.235
Come on.

07:14.268 --> 07:15.848
You said you wanted to
get rid of that stuff.

07:15.894 --> 07:16.904
What, are you kidding?

07:16.937 --> 07:19.357
This is my old bat bank.
I'm saving it for Griff.

07:19.398 --> 07:20.438
Yeah, right.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.902
Griff, let's play some catch. Here.

07:23.694 --> 07:24.904
Hi-yo, Silver!

07:25.571 --> 07:29.071
Yeah! Nice. Team Bowen!

07:29.408 --> 07:31.198
Eric, leave him be.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.327
Well, we're bonding.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.500
I don't know that you are.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.078
I'll throw you a ball, okay?

07:36.415 --> 07:37.425
Why?

07:37.791 --> 07:39.171
'Cause it's fun.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.796
I'll throw you a pop-up, okay?

07:41.837 --> 07:43.707
You gotta go for this one.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.295
Okay, you ready?

07:48.427 --> 07:49.677
You got it.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.890
Well, that's my bad.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.315
I missed.

07:54.349 --> 07:55.559
That's okay.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.851
We'll try again later. It was my fault.
I threw it too hard.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.686
Well, get the ball, will you, kiddo?

08:00.731 --> 08:02.111
Good job!

08:02.941 --> 08:03.941
He can play soccer.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.614
Yeah. Or chess, Eric.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.606
I'm getting rid of this.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.449
Have you seen the baseball?

09:02.334 --> 09:04.464
Mom! Mom! Mom!

09:04.503 --> 09:05.713
The tree made a noise!

09:05.754 --> 09:06.804
- What?
- The tree growled!

09:06.839 --> 09:10.629
Okay, look, Griff, Griff, Griff, Griff.
It's an old tree.

09:10.676 --> 09:12.216
Okay? Things creak when they get old.

09:12.261 --> 09:13.301
Yeah, tell me about it.

09:13.345 --> 09:14.965
Right? Like Daddy.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.230
What can I do to make it better?

09:20.853 --> 09:21.903
I don't know.

09:22.646 --> 09:24.806
You wanna go inside
and check out your new room?

09:25.232 --> 09:26.402
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.781
- All right. Can we get rid of this?
- I don't know.

09:28.819 --> 09:29.899
- Say yes.
- Yes.

09:29.945 --> 09:32.575
Mommies creak when they get old too.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.594
What if the bad guys break in a window?

09:54.636 --> 09:56.296
Then the alarm will still go off.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.386
But what if the bad guys
cut the wires to the alarm?

09:58.432 --> 10:00.352
The wires are in the house.

10:00.392 --> 10:03.402
But what if the bad guys go to the
power plant and cut the wires there?

10:03.437 --> 10:06.977
They'll be electrocuted
and then they'll be dead.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.444
And if they're dead,
then they can't get in the house.

10:09.484 --> 10:10.494
We armed yet?

10:12.070 --> 10:13.240
Getting there.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.530
Might wanna think about
getting a dog or something.

10:16.575 --> 10:17.915
No!

10:17.951 --> 10:21.411
Here, it says you have to input
the security code, and then the Stay key.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.795
Oh, yeah, smart guy?

10:22.831 --> 10:24.041
What was that?

10:24.082 --> 10:25.382
Same thing happened to me.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.917
Isn't that weird? It's not even winter.

10:28.921 --> 10:33.051
And they found this house,
and they ate it all up.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.474
What are you doing?

10:36.595 --> 10:37.855
Playing.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.643
Do you wanna see a trick?

10:41.517 --> 10:43.137
What kind of trick?

10:59.785 --> 11:02.665
No way. How are you doing that?

11:08.168 --> 11:09.748
You try.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.480
You look ridiculous!

11:58.594 --> 12:00.144
Shoot.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.963
What is that?

12:58.487 --> 13:00.697
I just lost an earring
behind the washing machine.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.699
That's a bummer, honey.

13:03.158 --> 13:04.698
I'll go look for it.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.485
There's a leak back there.

13:07.746 --> 13:10.456
Great. Welcome to owning a new home.

13:11.667 --> 13:12.877
I had to do something.

13:12.918 --> 13:15.548
This place is, like,
a complete shithole.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.957
There's not even any malls.
Like, the malls are boarded up.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.586
Oh, my God,
that actually sounds really sad.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.391
- So, your dad can't find...
- Dude.

13:22.427 --> 13:25.597
This 1920s bungalow
was the site of a murder.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.429
Oh, yeah, I love that show.

13:29.518 --> 13:31.898
Oh, my God, that guy's a total freak.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.437
I know.

13:34.773 --> 13:38.493
I'm Carrigan Burke,
and I'm here to clean house.

13:39.611 --> 13:42.071
Oh, yeah.
I love when he's, like... Okay, ready?

13:42.114 --> 13:43.664
"This house is clean."

13:43.699 --> 13:44.699
"Is clean."

13:45.117 --> 13:47.157
Hey, hey, hey.
Can you turn that down?

13:47.703 --> 13:48.753
Come in?

13:48.787 --> 13:50.077
Kids are going to sleep.

13:51.081 --> 13:52.171
Hi, Lauren.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.627
Hey, Mrs. Bowen.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.289
Thank you. Good night.

13:58.547 --> 13:59.547
"Mrs. Bowen"?

14:09.183 --> 14:12.693
All right, lovebugs. It's time for bed.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.608
Look at this mess.
Can you clean this up, Griff?

14:14.646 --> 14:15.806
The door's stuck.

14:16.148 --> 14:17.188
Awesome!

14:17.232 --> 14:18.442
I think there are magnets in there.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.943
They're not magnets. They're my friends.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.276
Who are your friends?

14:22.821 --> 14:24.661
The lost people.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.698
The lost people? Who are the lost people?

14:29.411 --> 14:34.081
They live here. But they don't like it.
They wanna go to their home.

14:36.168 --> 14:38.088
Sweetheart, we are home.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.212
We're not lost.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.131
This is our home for a little while, okay?

14:43.175 --> 14:44.805
Okay, Mommy.

14:44.843 --> 14:45.843
You sure?

15:07.282 --> 15:09.742
But why do I have to be up here?

15:09.785 --> 15:13.415
Because this is the coolest room
in the house.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.825
And you are the coolest kid
in the house.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.380
But I don't like the ceiling.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.168
Now you're just being silly.
Come on.

15:25.342 --> 15:26.762
Who's my super boy?

15:26.802 --> 15:28.012
Mom.

15:28.053 --> 15:30.973
I'm sorry, are you too big
to say it now?

15:31.348 --> 15:32.348
No.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.104
Then who's my super boy?

15:34.768 --> 15:36.098
I am.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.444
Yeah, you are.

15:39.231 --> 15:40.231
I love you.

15:40.691 --> 15:42.571
I love you, too.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.239
All right, get some sleep, okay?

15:59.251 --> 16:01.251
The night-light! Night-light!

16:02.296 --> 16:05.376
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Okay, okay, okay?

16:05.424 --> 16:06.424
Is that better?

16:07.968 --> 16:10.218
Griffin, there's nothing to be afraid of.

16:10.846 --> 16:12.006
Okay.

16:13.515 --> 16:14.555
Good night, buddy.

16:14.892 --> 16:15.892
Good night.

16:29.114 --> 16:31.034
What was Griff freaking out about?

16:31.074 --> 16:32.584
- The night-light.
- Yeah?

16:32.618 --> 16:36.158
"The night-light, the night-light!"
I don't know what it is with him.

16:36.205 --> 16:37.875
Yeah, well, we got too many kids.

16:37.915 --> 16:41.255
I know.
I said we should have stopped at two.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.133
Maddy's not the problem.

16:43.629 --> 16:44.629
Not yet.

16:45.464 --> 16:47.134
Here's to the little jerks.

16:50.469 --> 16:52.049
Do you think we should
take him to a shrink?

16:52.095 --> 16:55.015
No. No. He's fine.

16:55.057 --> 16:58.557
He's not fine.
It's because I lost him in that mall.

16:58.602 --> 17:01.022
Baby. That was three years ago...

17:01.063 --> 17:03.233
and you were more freaked out
than he was.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.443
Some kids are just nervous, you know?

17:05.483 --> 17:07.284
My brother was the same way.

17:07.319 --> 17:08.608
Yeah, now he lives alone
in a trailer park.

17:08.654 --> 17:09.704
- He doesn't live alone.
- Yes, he does!

17:09.738 --> 17:11.608
No, he's got, like, 20 cockatoos.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.237
You are not making me feel better!

18:37.701 --> 18:39.581
Maybe you could coach.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.540
What, high school?

18:41.580 --> 18:44.920
Yeah. It'd be something.
I mean, you'd be happy.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.838
Yeah, I'd be hungry. We'd all be.

18:46.877 --> 18:50.257
Can't support a family
coaching high school.

18:51.381 --> 18:53.221
I should go back to work.

18:53.258 --> 18:56.428
Again with that? Come on.
You don't wanna do that.

18:56.470 --> 18:57.930
You're gonna leave me all alone
with these monsters?

18:57.971 --> 19:00.021
I need new underwear.
Look at these.

19:00.057 --> 19:01.347
These are sad.

19:01.391 --> 19:02.731
Your underwear is sad?

19:02.768 --> 19:05.398
Yes, my underwear is sad.

19:05.437 --> 19:08.567
Well, mine are very happy right now,
so get over here.

19:09.525 --> 19:10.735
I'm serious.

19:11.360 --> 19:14.110
You can't keep holding out
for something at your old salary.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.526
I think you're holding out.

19:16.573 --> 19:18.413
- Why can't I just look for something?
- I'm not holding out.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.450
Because we agreed I'd work
so you could write your book.

19:20.494 --> 19:22.254
That's what we agreed about.

19:22.955 --> 19:24.585
I'm not writing my book.

19:24.623 --> 19:26.373
You will,
when the kids go back to school.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.246
Don't put this on the kids.
This is all me.

19:28.293 --> 19:31.093
Hey, I'm gonna find something, okay?

19:31.129 --> 19:32.589
You gotta trust me.

19:32.631 --> 19:34.301
We got that dinner party tomorrow night.

19:35.259 --> 19:38.509
You love parties.
You can watch me drink bourbon.

19:38.554 --> 19:41.514
It's gonna be such a drag.
We don't even know those people.

19:41.557 --> 19:43.797
But Gary knows them.
He says the husband might be hiring.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.232
Yeah.

19:45.269 --> 19:48.309
Maybe our luck is about to change.
Aren't you feeling lucky?

19:49.064 --> 19:51.574
I think things are looking up.

19:51.608 --> 19:54.358
You're such a dork!

19:54.403 --> 19:57.163
I'm a dork? I'm a dork?

19:57.990 --> 19:59.370
You and your sad underwear.

19:59.408 --> 20:00.528
Take your pants off.

20:00.576 --> 20:02.286
Yes, ma'am.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.947
- Really?
- Yes, really.

20:03.996 --> 20:05.206
- Wow.
- Play ball.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.327
All right.

20:07.833 --> 20:08.923
- Dad!
- Yes!

20:09.835 --> 20:12.005
Hey. What's up, buddy?

20:12.045 --> 20:13.505
There's something upstairs.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.167
I think there's something in my room.

20:15.549 --> 20:17.509
I'll be out there in a second.

20:17.551 --> 20:18.971
So much for my luck.

20:19.011 --> 20:20.011
- Don't move.
- Okay.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.933
I'll be right back.
Think dirty thoughts.

20:22.973 --> 20:25.773
What is it, buddy?
Where is it? In the attic?

20:27.352 --> 20:31.192
Houses make noises at night.
It's normal, I promise.

20:31.815 --> 20:34.225
Not our old house.

20:34.943 --> 20:36.493
Well, that's true.

20:37.613 --> 20:39.783
Tell me where you heard it.

20:46.455 --> 20:48.465
Where did all of these clowns come from?

20:48.498 --> 20:50.038
I found them in there.

20:51.251 --> 20:54.211
Why would somebody have a box of clowns?

20:55.214 --> 20:57.424
People collect weird things, pal.

20:57.466 --> 20:58.836
I don't like it up here.

20:59.593 --> 21:03.563
What's the matter? You scared?
What are you scared of?

21:04.598 --> 21:05.598
Everything.

21:09.144 --> 21:12.444
You're gonna get over that.
You gotta try to worry less, kiddo.

21:13.023 --> 21:14.023
You know?

21:14.775 --> 21:17.615
If you're scared all the time,
Maddy's gonna get scared.

21:19.404 --> 21:20.824
You gotta set a good example.

21:20.864 --> 21:23.664
You're the big brother.
You gotta be brave, you know?

21:25.077 --> 21:26.327
Holy shit!

21:28.539 --> 21:30.039
What is it?

21:30.582 --> 21:32.252
Talk to me.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.630
Why do you linger here?

21:35.087 --> 21:37.757
Use me. I can release you. Use me.

21:42.344 --> 21:43.804
What's going on?

21:43.846 --> 21:45.096
I don't know.

21:48.308 --> 21:51.098
Eric, what is going on up there?

21:52.980 --> 21:54.270
What, what, what?

22:03.949 --> 22:04.949
We have a squirrel.

22:05.450 --> 22:07.450
You are such a nut ball!

22:07.494 --> 22:09.294
- Big, fluffy tail!
- You scared us!

22:09.329 --> 22:10.409
Terrifying!

22:10.455 --> 22:12.285
Perfect. Rodents.

22:14.293 --> 22:16.093
I'll set a trap tomorrow.

22:16.128 --> 22:20.418
After you catch it with the trap,
will you release it to the woods?

22:20.465 --> 22:23.635
Yeah, sure.
Would that make you feel better, honey?

22:24.469 --> 22:26.139
I'm not sleeping up there
until it's gone.

23:49.012 --> 23:50.222
Where are you?

23:54.893 --> 23:57.603
Are you nice?

24:01.441 --> 24:03.441
How did you get there?

24:07.155 --> 24:08.695
Did you cry?

24:16.498 --> 24:18.418
Help you how?

24:27.176 --> 24:29.256
But I can't see you.

24:33.807 --> 24:36.427
Who else is there with you?

24:41.773 --> 24:44.943
Can Griffin come, too?

24:49.698 --> 24:53.028
Yes, I can be brave.

24:56.955 --> 25:00.205
I have to ask my mommy.

25:14.932 --> 25:16.352
No.

25:18.268 --> 25:19.938
I'm not afraid.

25:21.980 --> 25:23.150
Yes.

25:24.650 --> 25:27.940
But, how will you get here?

25:35.994 --> 25:37.794
Maddy, what's going on?

25:39.957 --> 25:42.037
They're coming.

25:42.376 --> 25:43.376
Who is?

25:43.669 --> 25:45.169
Who is coming?

25:56.890 --> 25:57.970
Maddy!

25:58.016 --> 25:59.766
Get away from the TV!

26:11.238 --> 26:12.908
What's going on?

26:19.580 --> 26:21.710
They're here.

26:42.227 --> 26:45.017
It says here it's probably just a
loose conductor in the electrical panel.

26:45.063 --> 26:46.653
I'm calling an electrician.

26:46.690 --> 26:48.650
Are you gonna pay him
for what I can do myself?

26:48.692 --> 26:50.862
Those guys charge an arm and a leg.
Griff will help. Right, buddy?

26:50.903 --> 26:53.023
- Griff will help you fix an electrical panel?
- Yeah.

26:53.572 --> 26:56.372
I found out where the squirrel
got in, by the way.

26:56.408 --> 26:58.368
There's a hole by the roof line.
I'm gonna block it up.

26:58.410 --> 27:00.700
Daddy, I don't want cereal.
I want pizza.

27:00.746 --> 27:02.036
Yeah, for breakfast?

27:02.080 --> 27:03.210
For all the time!

27:03.248 --> 27:04.368
Three times a day?

27:04.416 --> 27:06.536
Griffin! I told you not to
touch my phone!

27:06.585 --> 27:07.845
I didn't touch your phone.

27:07.878 --> 27:09.878
- Then why is it fried?
- How should I know?

27:09.922 --> 27:11.462
Here we go.

27:11.507 --> 27:13.627
- I need a new phone.
- You do?

27:13.675 --> 27:14.875
No more phones, honey.

27:14.927 --> 27:17.677
This isn't a luxury item, Dad.
It's a necessity.

27:17.721 --> 27:19.681
What if you need to reach me
in an emergency?

27:19.723 --> 27:20.893
We can't afford it, honey.

27:20.933 --> 27:22.063
That's bullshit.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.890
What are you being so selfish about?

27:23.936 --> 27:25.346
That's bullshit!

27:25.395 --> 27:27.725
If you want a new phone,
you could get a part-time job.

27:27.773 --> 27:29.483
I'll get a job when you get a job.

27:29.525 --> 27:30.735
Hey, she has a job!

27:30.776 --> 27:31.816
Excuse me?

27:31.860 --> 27:33.280
You kids are her job!

27:34.029 --> 27:36.449
Yeah. Which I apparently suck at.

27:36.782 --> 27:38.202
I don't think you suck at it.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.080
Thank you, sweetheart.

27:43.288 --> 27:44.458
Hey, Maddy.

27:45.207 --> 27:47.747
Do you remember last night?

27:47.793 --> 27:49.753
When you said, "They're here"?

27:52.548 --> 27:54.588
What did you mean?

27:54.633 --> 27:55.763
Who's here?

27:55.801 --> 27:57.891
Just my friends.

27:57.928 --> 27:59.428
Yeah?

27:59.471 --> 28:01.511
Your pretend friends?

28:01.557 --> 28:05.477
No, they're lost people.
They're not pretend, Mommy.

28:11.316 --> 28:13.896
That girl's gonna put me in a hole, man.

28:13.944 --> 28:15.454
She's grounded.

28:16.488 --> 28:19.118
Judge Bowen has spoken.
For at least 24 hours.

28:19.157 --> 28:21.237
Remind her she's babysitting tonight,
will you?

28:21.493 --> 28:23.203
I hate when Kendra babysits.

28:23.245 --> 28:24.795
So does she, pal.

28:24.830 --> 28:27.290
I think I might get some squirrel traps.

28:27.332 --> 28:29.042
Yeah, that's a good idea.

28:29.084 --> 28:31.094
What is this?

28:31.753 --> 28:32.923
- Griffin, put that down.
- What is that?

28:32.963 --> 28:34.963
- Put that down.
- Is that a bone or something?

28:35.007 --> 28:36.837
- Yeah, just put that down.
- Let me see.

28:36.884 --> 28:39.474
I guess this is a buried pet or something.
Maybe it's a horse.

28:40.512 --> 28:41.812
Maybe it's a pig, too! A pig!

28:41.847 --> 28:42.967
Is this freaking you out?

28:43.640 --> 28:45.600
- Stop! Stop!
- What's the matter?

28:46.268 --> 28:47.268
All right, put that back.

28:51.690 --> 28:53.900
- That's not going through.
- I'm sorry about that.

28:53.942 --> 28:57.072
My wife said she might cancel one of the
cards because we don't need them all.

28:57.112 --> 28:58.242
I didn't know she did it.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.860
It's not canceled, it's over the limit.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.532
- Is that what it says there?
- Yep.

29:04.369 --> 29:05.829
Okay, let's try this one.

29:07.956 --> 29:10.496
Nice apron.
Are you in the union?

29:10.542 --> 29:12.842
You have a good pension here, for this?

29:15.172 --> 29:16.262
- Sorry.
- Yeah?

29:16.298 --> 29:18.628
This one's "canceled" too.

29:20.802 --> 29:23.262
Strike two, huh? All right.

29:23.305 --> 29:24.855
Hey, third one's the charm.

29:24.890 --> 29:26.180
Fingers crossed.

29:33.148 --> 29:35.028
How are we doing?
Are we good?

29:35.400 --> 29:37.000
- I like that sound.
- Yeah, you're good.

29:37.027 --> 29:38.447
Okay.

29:59.007 --> 30:01.377
Damn it! Griffin!

30:01.426 --> 30:03.086
I asked you to bring these
comic books upstairs.

30:03.136 --> 30:05.006
I was just about to do it.

30:05.055 --> 30:06.885
Yeah, I almost broke my neck.

30:06.932 --> 30:10.272
Because you were walking and playing
that game at the same time, I bet.

30:10.310 --> 30:11.940
Thank you.

30:34.293 --> 30:35.463
Maddy?

30:36.253 --> 30:37.633
Is that you?

30:42.050 --> 30:43.260
Maddy?

30:56.815 --> 30:57.975
Maddy.

30:58.734 --> 31:00.494
This isn't funny.

32:06.635 --> 32:08.975
All right, everybody, come downstairs!

32:09.012 --> 32:10.562
- Family meeting.
- Dad! Dad!

32:10.597 --> 32:12.807
- Let's go! Kendra!
- Dad! I have to tell you something!

32:12.850 --> 32:15.890
- What's going on with the flowers out there?
- I don't know.

32:15.936 --> 32:17.686
Did you get pizza?
I just made chicken nuggets.

32:17.729 --> 32:19.189
That's okay. We'll have both.

32:19.231 --> 32:20.521
- Pizza!
- My baby wanted pizza.

32:20.566 --> 32:22.686
You put them together,
you got chicken nugget pizza.

32:22.734 --> 32:24.534
Dad, the weirdest thing happened!

32:24.570 --> 32:27.700
- Why are you screaming at me, Griffin?
- Griffin, you got to tone it down.

32:27.739 --> 32:30.409
- What?
- "What?" Here's what.

32:31.493 --> 32:32.703
- What's that?
- What do you think of that?

32:32.744 --> 32:34.044
- No way!
- Yeah, way!

32:34.079 --> 32:35.409
- You know what else?
- Now get off my back.

32:35.455 --> 32:36.705
- Thank you, Dad.
- You got it.

32:36.748 --> 32:38.418
- Dad! And guess what?
- Yeah.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.208
- The ball rolled across the floor...
- What? What?

32:40.252 --> 32:41.962
- Knocked into the closet...
- Hey, look at this!

32:42.004 --> 32:44.014
I got you that AR.Drone you wanted.

32:44.047 --> 32:46.087
- Look at that. Isn't that cool?
- Dad, you aren't listening to me!

32:46.133 --> 32:47.433
- It's got a camera on it.
- It does?

32:47.467 --> 32:48.637
What are you doing?

32:48.677 --> 32:50.257
What are you doing, cutie?

32:50.304 --> 32:52.314
Look at that.
These are the ones you liked.

32:52.347 --> 32:53.597
You can wear them to the party tonight.

32:53.640 --> 32:54.770
Dad, that's not all!

32:54.808 --> 32:56.228
Then this tower of comic books formed!

32:56.268 --> 32:58.108
When I turned around
they blew back at my face!

32:58.270 --> 32:59.940
- Wow.
- They had just appeared out of nowhere...

32:59.980 --> 33:01.560
Really? That's crazy!

33:01.607 --> 33:03.937
- It's not funny, Dad!
- Yeah, it's hilarious.

33:03.984 --> 33:05.324
How did you pay for this?

33:05.777 --> 33:08.407
How do you think? I stole it.
Robbed a bank.

33:08.447 --> 33:09.567
Uh-oh.

33:09.615 --> 33:11.535
Uh-oh, Daddy-O!

33:11.575 --> 33:13.995
We gotta bring this stuff back.
You have to take it back.

33:14.036 --> 33:15.196
- Mom, no.
- Yes.

33:15.245 --> 33:16.655
- I'm not bringing anything back.
- Dad!

33:16.705 --> 33:18.265
- Griffin.
- I think we deserve a treat.

33:18.290 --> 33:21.080
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

33:21.126 --> 33:23.796
Griffin! Gosh!
It's been all afternoon with this.

33:24.421 --> 33:26.721
Just so you know,
I'm putting the passcode on my phone...

33:26.757 --> 33:28.677
- so you can't get to it.
- Please don't antagonize him.

33:28.717 --> 33:31.047
- Dad, we have to move.
- We're not moving!

33:31.094 --> 33:32.224
- Now, quit it!
- Amy...

33:32.262 --> 33:33.352
No, I expect this from Maddy...

33:33.388 --> 33:35.708
but I'm starting to think
that he's the baby in the family.

33:39.061 --> 33:40.441
- Here you go, Mommy.
- Perfect.

33:40.479 --> 33:41.729
Thank you, sweetheart.

33:41.772 --> 33:43.112
Griffin, I'm sorry.

33:43.148 --> 33:44.898
That didn't go as I hoped.

33:45.359 --> 33:46.569
How's the pizza?

33:47.277 --> 33:49.197
- Not good.
- No?

33:49.238 --> 33:50.488
No.

33:52.533 --> 33:54.583
You got to try it with the nuggets.

33:54.618 --> 33:55.948
It's a little better.

34:02.543 --> 34:07.173
I am an awful person.
I called my own son a baby.

34:07.673 --> 34:11.893
Well, if it's any consolation,
my mom called me a lot worse.

34:13.512 --> 34:15.851
There's something wrong with him, Eric.

34:16.681 --> 34:18.482
It's not just the anxiety.

34:19.016 --> 34:20.806
- He's fine.
- He's not fine.

34:20.853 --> 34:23.652
He is saying the craziest things
and he believes them.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.321
All right, what do you want me to do?
You want me to...

34:28.360 --> 34:29.360
I'll take him to someone.

34:29.402 --> 34:32.493
How? I mean, you keep spending money
that we don't have.

34:32.531 --> 34:33.531
Why are you doing that?

34:33.574 --> 34:35.704
I mean, what do I got, the illusion of...

34:37.286 --> 34:38.406
Spending money?

34:38.453 --> 34:39.913
I'm trying to... I'm doing the best I can.

34:39.955 --> 34:42.585
I wanna give you guys what you want.
I'm trying to...

34:43.458 --> 34:45.338
I know. I know. I know.

34:45.377 --> 34:48.127
Look, look, look, look,
it was a bad day, okay?

34:48.797 --> 34:50.007
It'll get better.

34:52.717 --> 34:54.838
- I'm gonna go get ready.
- Okay.

35:09.610 --> 35:11.490
- It's the windmill!
- Daddy! Break my arm!

35:11.528 --> 35:12.698
- Okay. Okay.
- Break my arm! Break my neck!

35:12.738 --> 35:14.488
- Dad?
- Neck! Neck!

35:14.531 --> 35:16.281
Dad, what if the squirrel gets in?

35:16.325 --> 35:18.285
I sealed up the hole.
It's tighter than Fort Knox up there.

35:18.327 --> 35:19.367
Bye-bye, Daddy.

35:19.411 --> 35:21.871
- Then why did you leave the trap?
- Insurance. You can't be too safe.

35:21.914 --> 35:23.674
Squirrels are wily.

35:23.707 --> 35:25.707
- Don't worry about it.
- Bye-bye.

35:25.751 --> 35:27.501
- Set the alarm, call us if you need us.
- I will.

35:27.544 --> 35:29.224
- Call you on my new phone.
- Yeah, you will.

35:29.254 --> 35:30.964
- Be good for your sister.
- Bye, Mommy.

35:31.006 --> 35:33.216
- Lock the door!
- Bye. We will. Bye.

35:33.258 --> 35:34.678
I wanna stay up all night!

35:34.718 --> 35:35.888
No. Madison...

35:35.928 --> 35:37.298
- Stay up all night!
- No, go upstairs.

35:37.346 --> 35:38.426
No!

35:38.680 --> 35:40.720
All right. All snug?

35:41.058 --> 35:42.388
Wait.

35:42.434 --> 35:45.404
Piggy-corn said she wants more kisses.

35:45.437 --> 35:46.647
She does?

35:47.189 --> 35:48.359
How many?

35:49.441 --> 35:50.731
She says three.

35:50.776 --> 35:51.856
- Three?
- Three.

35:51.902 --> 35:53.652
Sure? Okay.

35:54.029 --> 35:57.239
One, two, three...

35:57.282 --> 35:59.082
20. 900.

35:59.535 --> 36:01.205
I can't fall asleep.

36:02.120 --> 36:03.290
Why not?

36:04.206 --> 36:06.616
I think there's a storm coming.

36:10.254 --> 36:12.594
Gary tells me you played
ball together in college.

36:12.631 --> 36:13.971
He said you had quite the swing.

36:14.007 --> 36:16.047
Triple-A, but I still do swing
with the best of them.

36:16.093 --> 36:17.763
Don't get any ideas, Barbara.

36:19.012 --> 36:21.512
He could have played in the majors.
He's being very modest.

36:21.557 --> 36:24.427
No, I... Bad shoulder,
so it wasn't meant to be.

36:24.726 --> 36:25.846
What are you gonna do?

36:25.894 --> 36:27.904
Lucky you had a plan B
to fall back on.

36:27.938 --> 36:29.768
There's nothing wrong
with a suit and tie.

36:29.815 --> 36:32.195
I keep telling my son, it pays the rent.

36:32.609 --> 36:34.149
It's a good thing
I have a suit and a tie then.

36:34.194 --> 36:35.824
I can put it on Monday morning if you like.

36:35.863 --> 36:37.493
What time do I start? Nine?

36:37.531 --> 36:38.811
They just moved to Willow Point.

36:39.032 --> 36:41.952
My brother had a house
in that development back in the 90s.

36:41.994 --> 36:44.374
We'd never visit him
because of the cemetery thing.

36:44.413 --> 36:46.503
The thought of it
just gave me the willies.

36:46.540 --> 36:47.790
What "cemetery thing"?

36:47.833 --> 36:50.843
Just that that development
was built on a former cemetery.

36:50.878 --> 36:52.708
- Yeah, but they moved it though.
- Yeah.

36:52.754 --> 36:55.224
The developers relocated the whole thing
to Broxton Park.

36:55.257 --> 36:57.837
200 acres.
This was years ago.

36:58.927 --> 37:01.047
You're kidding me!
They moved the whole cemetery?

37:01.430 --> 37:02.970
The realtor didn't mention it?

37:03.015 --> 37:05.815
No. Actually, they didn't mention it.

37:05.851 --> 37:10.191
Isn't it like, you know, very uncool
to move all those bodies and...

37:10.230 --> 37:12.770
Well, it's not like it was
an ancient tribal burial ground.

37:12.816 --> 37:13.816
Yeah, I know.

37:13.859 --> 37:17.239
It's just 10 minutes away.
People can still visit loved ones.

37:17.279 --> 37:19.239
But now it's in a nicer neighborhood.

37:19.698 --> 37:20.868
I'm sorry.

39:23.405 --> 39:25.025
There's nothing to be afraid of.

39:25.073 --> 39:27.033
There's nothing to be afraid of.

39:27.075 --> 39:29.285
There's nothing to be afraid of.

39:29.328 --> 39:31.158
There's nothing to be afraid of.

41:32.159 --> 41:33.329
Help!

41:33.368 --> 41:35.158
Please, help!

43:08.505 --> 43:10.005
Kendra!

43:13.510 --> 43:14.680
Maddy.

43:24.813 --> 43:27.323
We're gonna get in big trouble.

43:32.404 --> 43:33.414
Griffin?

43:35.657 --> 43:36.697
Griffin!

43:37.367 --> 43:38.737
I'm scared!

43:38.785 --> 43:40.575
Just stay away from the closet.

43:40.621 --> 43:42.581
Don't leave me!

43:46.084 --> 43:47.384
Kendra!

43:48.754 --> 43:49.754
Kendra!

44:04.561 --> 44:06.731
Griffin! Please open the door!

44:06.772 --> 44:09.482
Please help! Please help me! Please!

44:09.525 --> 44:10.945
Open the door!

46:51.562 --> 46:53.232
What the hell is that?

46:53.272 --> 46:54.612
Honey, stop...

46:55.274 --> 46:56.864
Stop the car.

46:57.401 --> 46:58.611
Stop the car.

47:05.367 --> 47:07.037
Somebody!

47:07.077 --> 47:09.497
- Griff!
- Dad! Help!

47:09.538 --> 47:10.538
Griffin!

47:10.956 --> 47:13.576
Oh, my God!
Baby, are you all right?

47:14.042 --> 47:15.752
- Mom, Mom!
- Okay, baby.

47:15.794 --> 47:17.554
What the hell is going on?

47:17.588 --> 47:18.588
Mom!

47:18.964 --> 47:20.174
Dad, Mom...

47:20.215 --> 47:21.255
- What's going...
- There were voices...

47:21.300 --> 47:23.930
I got locked in the basement
and the tree grabbed Griffin...

47:23.969 --> 47:25.759
Slow down. I cannot...
What did you say?

47:25.804 --> 47:27.314
I can't find Maddy!

47:38.901 --> 47:40.111
Madison!

47:41.486 --> 47:42.986
Maddy, honey...

47:47.951 --> 47:48.991
Madison!

47:56.168 --> 47:57.338
Maddy?

48:07.471 --> 48:08.511
Mommy...

48:15.854 --> 48:17.944
- Madison?
- Mommy...

48:21.193 --> 48:22.443
Mommy.

48:26.865 --> 48:27.865
Mom?

48:28.784 --> 48:30.124
Mom?

48:31.036 --> 48:32.036
Mom!

48:32.454 --> 48:33.504
Mom!

48:33.539 --> 48:35.499
Griff. What...

48:37.751 --> 48:39.881
Mommy? Mommy?

48:45.217 --> 48:46.837
Maddy, where are you?

48:54.518 --> 48:56.558
Mommy. Mommy.

49:01.483 --> 49:03.863
Daddy, is that you?

49:11.702 --> 49:14.042
- I don't even know what happened.
- I know, but we have to tell them.

49:14.079 --> 49:15.959
We gotta figure out what happened.

49:15.998 --> 49:17.708
We can't call the cops.

49:17.749 --> 49:19.879
What are you gonna tell them?
That our daughter got...

49:19.918 --> 49:21.798
- I don't know what just happened.
- I'm gonna tell them...

49:21.837 --> 49:24.207
We need to figure out
what's going on. Okay?

49:24.256 --> 49:26.216
Listen to me. Listen to me.

49:26.258 --> 49:27.378
If you call the cops...

49:27.426 --> 49:28.756
- they're gonna blame us.
- No, they're not gonna blame us.

49:28.802 --> 49:30.182
- They're not gonna believe us.
- We're just gonna tell them what happened.

49:30.220 --> 49:31.890
- There's gonna be news vans all over the lawn.
- We're just gonna tell them the truth.

49:31.930 --> 49:33.520
I'm gonna tell them the truth.

49:33.557 --> 49:34.887
I'm gonna tell them the truth.

49:34.933 --> 49:36.233
We're gonna tell them the truth
together.

49:36.268 --> 49:39.348
I'm gonna tell them the truth.
What happened, I'm gonna tell them.

49:39.396 --> 49:41.936
But we don't know
what the truth is, honey.

49:41.982 --> 49:43.612
Eric, we have to call somebody.

49:46.278 --> 49:49.158
There's gotta be somebody
who's gonna believe us.

49:54.494 --> 49:56.584
Griffin was the first one to notice things.

49:56.622 --> 50:00.632
Noises... and just things.

50:03.462 --> 50:05.132
We thought he was making it up.

50:05.923 --> 50:07.303
I'm sorry, buddy.

50:08.759 --> 50:10.259
We didn't know where else to go.

50:10.302 --> 50:12.222
No, you did the right thing coming here.

50:12.262 --> 50:14.182
When I was a student here...

50:14.223 --> 50:16.393
this office had the craziest reputation.

50:16.642 --> 50:17.772
I think we still do.

50:19.394 --> 50:20.774
May I ask where your husband is?

50:20.812 --> 50:23.022
He's at home with Kendra, our oldest.

50:23.065 --> 50:25.035
We don't wanna leave Maddy alone.

50:25.526 --> 50:29.146
The last time you had contact with her
was after she disappeared?

50:29.196 --> 50:32.816
Just the one time,
through the television set.

50:32.866 --> 50:35.326
I'm sorry...
I hear how crazy this sounds.

50:35.369 --> 50:36.949
I know I must sound ridiculous.

50:36.995 --> 50:39.865
No, it doesn't.
It doesn't sound crazy at all.

50:39.915 --> 50:41.625
- It's my fault.
- No, it is not.

50:41.667 --> 50:45.127
Look at me. It is not your fault.

50:45.170 --> 50:47.760
Why do you think it's your fault?

50:48.090 --> 50:49.510
I left her alone.

50:50.092 --> 50:52.182
I knew I shouldn't have.

50:52.719 --> 50:54.639
But I was scared.

50:54.680 --> 50:57.180
Of course you were scared.

50:58.433 --> 51:01.143
You have to get my sister back.

51:01.186 --> 51:02.726
You have to.

51:04.189 --> 51:05.819
Can you do that?

51:07.901 --> 51:09.361
I can try.

51:26.128 --> 51:28.418
That's the TV...

51:28.463 --> 51:33.263
where Maddy's hands
were pressed against.

51:33.302 --> 51:38.602
This is the staircase that Griffin
was first grabbed by the tree.

51:38.640 --> 51:40.600
It's probably something to do
with Maddy.

51:40.642 --> 51:42.732
And then there's that.
That's a little shocker.

51:42.769 --> 51:44.229
You guys want some sandwiches
or something?

51:44.271 --> 51:45.901
- It won't be necessary.
- I'm gonna start recording.

51:45.939 --> 51:47.689
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

51:47.733 --> 51:49.323
Knock yourself out.

51:52.487 --> 51:53.607
That's solid wall.

51:53.655 --> 51:57.405
I've poked and prodded
about a hundred times, so...

51:58.118 --> 52:01.198
But you think she got pulled
through there somehow?

52:01.246 --> 52:02.576
We don't know.

52:03.415 --> 52:05.915
What do you think,
it's like a magic portal?

52:06.668 --> 52:07.838
I just said we don't know.

52:08.086 --> 52:09.546
Do you mind if I hold onto that?

52:09.588 --> 52:11.208
Till she gets back.

52:11.256 --> 52:13.926
I don't want it, you know,
lost in the shuffle.

52:13.967 --> 52:15.587
No problem.

52:20.432 --> 52:23.892
I shot a pretty amazing
occurrence recently.

52:23.936 --> 52:27.356
We were at this old house in Naperville,
and a piano bench...

52:27.773 --> 52:30.233
rolled 10 feet across the parlor floor.

52:30.943 --> 52:32.363
It took seven hours.

52:33.320 --> 52:35.240
- To roll 10 feet?
- Yeah.

52:35.280 --> 52:39.080
I used a special time-lapse setting
on my camera.

52:39.117 --> 52:41.827
So, nailed the whole thing.

52:42.287 --> 52:45.037
You can't catch that kind of a thing
with the naked eye, so I...

52:55.175 --> 52:58.675
Did you get all that
on your time-lapse camera?

53:01.181 --> 53:02.431
From my experience...

53:02.474 --> 53:05.314
this doesn't seem to be
a classic haunting.

53:05.894 --> 53:08.274
What you have here...

53:08.313 --> 53:12.113
is probably closer to
a poltergeist intrusion.

53:12.150 --> 53:13.940
What's the difference?

53:13.986 --> 53:16.486
Ghosts usually appear
as harmless apparitions.

53:16.530 --> 53:18.370
Whereas poltergeists...

53:18.991 --> 53:21.621
They're noisy, they lash out...

53:21.660 --> 53:24.200
they're violent, they move objects.

53:24.246 --> 53:28.826
It comes, and then it can
just as suddenly go away.

53:29.668 --> 53:31.538
And take Maddy with it?

54:24.473 --> 54:26.143
- You okay?
- Yeah.

54:27.309 --> 54:28.729
What's going on?

54:30.896 --> 54:34.396
I should've been... home.

54:35.067 --> 54:37.027
- I should've been home.
- Don't do this, okay?

54:37.069 --> 54:38.949
I can't lose you now.

54:39.655 --> 54:42.455
If I say it's not gonna be okay...

54:42.491 --> 54:44.911
you have to say,
"Of course it is, sweetheart."

54:47.079 --> 54:49.459
Otherwise, we're not
gonna get through this.

55:03.095 --> 55:06.935
We've done a scan of the house,
and now we're wiring into your system.

55:06.974 --> 55:08.984
So if Maddy tries
to make contact again...

55:09.017 --> 55:10.977
we'll have a better sense
of what's going on...

55:11.019 --> 55:12.939
which may help us get her back.

55:12.980 --> 55:14.230
Does that sound okay?

55:14.273 --> 55:16.613
That sounds great.
Can we do it a little faster?

55:17.985 --> 55:19.155
Watch out.

55:21.947 --> 55:23.777
Let me ask you something.

55:24.658 --> 55:26.028
Your dad...

55:27.035 --> 55:28.995
he's been out of work a while, right?

55:29.955 --> 55:31.795
Yeah, I guess.

55:33.333 --> 55:36.173
That's okay. Nobody's perfect.

55:37.838 --> 55:39.628
I was just thinking about it.

55:39.965 --> 55:42.975
If he really wanted
to make some money quick...

55:43.010 --> 55:45.640
a poltergeist abduction
isn't a bad idea.

55:46.513 --> 55:48.853
Even if it turned out to be a fake.

55:48.891 --> 55:51.981
You go public with it,
you do some TV appearances.

55:52.019 --> 55:54.349
- You get your own reality show.
- Would you stop?

55:54.396 --> 55:55.806
How cool would that be?

55:56.356 --> 55:58.856
We don't want a reality show.

55:58.901 --> 56:00.441
We just want Maddy back.

56:04.406 --> 56:05.986
You're good, kid.

56:07.159 --> 56:08.739
Very good.

56:09.995 --> 56:13.295
Did you set up the heat sensor
in the back of the closet yet?

56:13.332 --> 56:14.622
No, not yet.

56:14.666 --> 56:16.706
I didn't know how to fasten that thing.

56:18.337 --> 56:19.877
Screw it, Boyd.

56:21.507 --> 56:22.717
Okay...

56:23.717 --> 56:24.837
Captain.

56:35.687 --> 56:37.187
"Screw it."

57:44.923 --> 57:46.803
Gotta be kidding me.

58:17.623 --> 58:19.003
God damn it.

58:58.372 --> 58:59.502
Gotcha.

59:33.866 --> 59:34.866
No!

01:00:06.064 --> 01:00:07.734
You all done up there?

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:09.780
Yeah.

01:00:09.818 --> 01:00:11.898
The heat sensor is in the closet?

01:00:15.032 --> 01:00:16.032
Sort of.

01:00:17.284 --> 01:00:19.954
Boyd, I really need you to
take this more seriously, okay?

01:00:20.412 --> 01:00:21.452
Okay?

01:00:21.496 --> 01:00:23.246
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

01:00:25.584 --> 01:00:27.504
I think what I was saying is...

01:00:27.544 --> 01:00:30.214
some people believe
there are different levels of reality.

01:00:30.255 --> 01:00:31.505
We're on a physical plane...

01:00:31.798 --> 01:00:35.218
but when we die
our spirits go to another level.

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:38.850
An astral plane or a spiritual plane.

01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:43.179
Which is sort of here
and not here at the same time.

01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:46.440
Okay...

01:00:47.898 --> 01:00:49.318
Look at this.

01:00:53.195 --> 01:00:56.075
Okay. Now this...

01:00:56.615 --> 01:00:58.075
Thank you, Dr. Powell.

01:00:58.116 --> 01:01:00.826
This is us here.
In the physical level.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.620
And somehow Maddy got pulled here.

01:01:08.001 --> 01:01:10.751
Here and not here at the same time.

01:01:11.213 --> 01:01:12.713
Exactly.

01:01:14.925 --> 01:01:18.855
Then someone should go in there
and show her the way back here.

01:01:19.972 --> 01:01:22.602
That's actually not a bad idea.

01:01:26.395 --> 01:01:28.405
I'm fairly certain...

01:01:28.438 --> 01:01:31.938
Maddy is able to hear us
a lot better than we can hear her.

01:01:31.984 --> 01:01:37.114
So this equipment is going to
filter out all the interference...

01:01:37.155 --> 01:01:40.775
so that we'll be better able
to communicate with her.

01:01:40.826 --> 01:01:42.156
How do we start?

01:01:44.955 --> 01:01:46.795
You just call out to her.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.540
Okay.

01:01:55.465 --> 01:01:56.835
Maddy?

01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:02.810
Madison, it's Mommy.

01:02:04.683 --> 01:02:05.983
Can you hear me?

01:02:06.518 --> 01:02:09.058
Madison, we wanna talk to you.

01:02:09.855 --> 01:02:12.825
We just want you
to let us know that you're safe.

01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:18.529
Are you with us?

01:02:19.948 --> 01:02:23.408
Maddy, we need to hear your voice,
okay, sweetheart?

01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:25.997
Can you say hello to Mommy?

01:02:33.795 --> 01:02:34.955
Are you with us?

01:02:36.173 --> 01:02:38.223
We all miss you so much.

01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:49.849
Mommy misses you
so, so, so, so, so, so much.

01:02:53.148 --> 01:02:54.858
Hi, Mommy.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.030
Hi, baby!

01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:58.569
Hey, honey. Daddy's here, too.

01:02:58.612 --> 01:03:00.912
We're all waiting for you, honey.

01:03:00.948 --> 01:03:03.118
Daddy, where are you?

01:03:03.158 --> 01:03:06.368
We're home. We need you
to come back to us now, honey.

01:03:06.411 --> 01:03:10.711
I tried, but I can't find you.

01:03:10.749 --> 01:03:13.209
Okay, okay, okay.
Keep on trying, okay?

01:03:13.252 --> 01:03:16.252
Because we are right here.
You're so close!

01:03:17.297 --> 01:03:21.047
Mommy? Mommy?

01:03:21.093 --> 01:03:23.223
Daddy, is that you?

01:03:23.262 --> 01:03:24.602
No, Daddy's right here, honey.

01:03:24.638 --> 01:03:27.178
There's somebody with her!
Who's with you, baby?

01:03:27.224 --> 01:03:28.814
- Daddy's right here.
- Who is with you?

01:03:28.851 --> 01:03:31.441
They're all around me.

01:03:37.401 --> 01:03:40.401
Maddy! Maddy? Maddy?

01:03:45.659 --> 01:03:47.409
- Maddy, can you hear us?
- What's going on?

01:03:49.454 --> 01:03:51.794
Mommy. Mommy.

01:03:52.249 --> 01:03:53.289
Daddy?

01:03:54.293 --> 01:03:55.463
Maddy!

01:03:55.794 --> 01:03:56.844
Madison?

01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:01.550
Daddy, I'm scared.

01:04:06.555 --> 01:04:07.605
Maddy!

01:04:07.639 --> 01:04:08.639
No, wait!

01:04:08.682 --> 01:04:09.682
Mr. Bowen, no!

01:04:48.972 --> 01:04:50.142
Maddy.

01:05:06.114 --> 01:05:08.204
Maddy, it's me, honey.

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:27.390
Give her back! Give her back!

01:05:29.096 --> 01:05:30.676
Give her back!
You can't have her!

01:05:32.891 --> 01:05:34.561
Get out!

01:06:02.588 --> 01:06:04.758
You okay? Did you get hit?

01:06:04.798 --> 01:06:06.008
No? You okay?

01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:07.049
Everything okay?

01:06:07.092 --> 01:06:08.222
What is that?

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.220
You're okay. Eric!

01:06:10.262 --> 01:06:11.352
Eric.

01:06:11.388 --> 01:06:12.428
What happened?

01:06:15.559 --> 01:06:18.599
That, Mr. Bowen...

01:06:18.645 --> 01:06:20.265
that's Maddy's way out.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:26.030
But I think we're gonna need some help
in getting her there.

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:27.069
What kind of help?

01:06:28.238 --> 01:06:30.908
Have you ever heard of Carrigan Burke?

01:06:32.159 --> 01:06:35.579
No effing way.

01:07:25.671 --> 01:07:27.381
What happened to your hand?

01:07:28.799 --> 01:07:31.719
Blanchard, Michigan. '97.

01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:36.350
Haunted root cellar.
Spirit didn't wanna leave.

01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:40.100
Luckily, they're not all that angry.

01:07:40.686 --> 01:07:41.686
Ours is.

01:07:43.814 --> 01:07:45.324
- Buddy, you okay?
- Yeah.

01:07:45.357 --> 01:07:46.397
Guy's here.

01:07:46.441 --> 01:07:47.981
You must be the Bowens.

01:07:48.026 --> 01:07:49.686
And you must be the cavalry.

01:07:54.032 --> 01:07:55.372
Dr. Powell.

01:07:56.410 --> 01:07:59.250
We're all set up
if you wanna get started.

01:08:05.878 --> 01:08:07.168
Hey.

01:08:07.212 --> 01:08:10.052
Big fan. My name's Boyd.
Nice to meet you.

01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:11.090
Here.

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.720
He knows this can't be on TV, right?

01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:20.229
No, I told him that.

01:08:21.059 --> 01:08:23.309
So why is he doing it?

01:08:23.353 --> 01:08:25.363
This was the area of bilocation?

01:08:25.981 --> 01:08:27.770
A table fell out of there.

01:08:27.816 --> 01:08:29.566
I was almost crushed.

01:08:32.112 --> 01:08:34.032
Is everything all right?

01:08:34.072 --> 01:08:36.242
If it was, I wouldn't be here.

01:08:44.166 --> 01:08:47.586
This house is not clean.

01:08:48.504 --> 01:08:49.504
What?

01:09:34.299 --> 01:09:37.799
All right, first things first.

01:09:37.845 --> 01:09:39.854
I want you to tell me
a little bit about Maddy.

01:09:40.555 --> 01:09:44.265
Did you ever feel that
she was a little bit off?

01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:45.519
- Off?
- Yeah.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.651
- What do you mean?
- How do you mean, "Off"?

01:09:47.688 --> 01:09:51.268
Did you ever hear her
talking to things that weren't there?

01:09:51.316 --> 01:09:54.646
Yeah, she has imaginary friends,
but that's normal.

01:09:55.487 --> 01:09:59.657
I think what he's trying to say is that
Maddy might have been born with a gift.

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:02.330
That's not the word I'd use,
but all right.

01:10:02.828 --> 01:10:06.208
You mean she can talk to ghosts?

01:10:06.582 --> 01:10:08.332
She's six years old.

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:11.335
Which means that her life force
is at its purest...

01:10:11.378 --> 01:10:14.668
without judgment or cynicism.

01:10:15.632 --> 01:10:17.882
Why do you think they reached out
to her in the first place?

01:10:17.926 --> 01:10:19.796
They didn't reach out to any of you.

01:10:19.845 --> 01:10:22.475
You keep saying "they."
Who are "they"?

01:10:24.308 --> 01:10:28.558
Brooke tells me that this development
was built on a cemetery.

01:10:30.647 --> 01:10:32.017
- Right?
- Dad, really?

01:10:32.065 --> 01:10:34.815
Calm down. It's a former cemetery.
Former.

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:36.780
They moved the bodies a long time ago.

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:39.490
- They relocated...
- They moved them to a nicer neighborhood.

01:10:39.531 --> 01:10:41.451
I don't think that they are.

01:10:41.491 --> 01:10:45.121
I think they just told people
they moved the cemetery.

01:10:45.162 --> 01:10:47.622
I think they just moved the headstones.

01:10:47.664 --> 01:10:49.714
And they left the bodies?

01:10:52.085 --> 01:10:53.125
Oh, my God.

01:10:54.129 --> 01:10:57.719
This isn't just a few pissed off spirits
that we're dealing with.

01:10:57.758 --> 01:11:01.508
This is unlike anything
that I've ever felt before.

01:11:01.553 --> 01:11:04.433
This is... It's more like a mob.

01:11:04.473 --> 01:11:07.933
They suffered a terrible injustice...

01:11:07.976 --> 01:11:12.976
and that anger and frustration
has created a new, more powerful force.

01:11:14.107 --> 01:11:16.067
The poltergeist.

01:11:16.109 --> 01:11:18.819
They are trapped
and they are desperate.

01:11:18.862 --> 01:11:22.532
And your daughter is their ticket
out of this purgatory.

01:11:22.574 --> 01:11:24.784
What do they want with her?

01:11:24.826 --> 01:11:27.576
They want her to be their lantern
in the darkness.

01:11:28.372 --> 01:11:30.372
To lead them into the light.

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.590
What happens if she goes into the light?

01:11:37.631 --> 01:11:40.551
There's no getting her back
if she does that.

01:11:40.884 --> 01:11:43.304
Just because he said that,
it doesn't mean...

01:11:44.179 --> 01:11:45.929
that's true, okay?

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.190
Nothing you've said makes sense to me.

01:11:50.227 --> 01:11:53.097
And everything else does, right?

01:11:53.146 --> 01:11:55.726
The closet, the tree,
the smoldering hole in the ceiling.

01:11:55.774 --> 01:11:58.404
All that makes sense to you,
but I'm full of crap.

01:11:58.443 --> 01:12:00.403
I don't know, okay?
I don't know.

01:12:02.072 --> 01:12:04.782
We just want our daughter back, okay?

01:12:04.825 --> 01:12:07.125
We just want our daughter back.

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.080
Eric, I know exactly how you feel.

01:12:09.121 --> 01:12:10.251
I don't know if you do.

01:12:10.289 --> 01:12:13.789
I've felt it every single day
of my entire life.

01:12:13.834 --> 01:12:18.384
It is hard to know what to believe in,
but I am here to help.

01:12:18.422 --> 01:12:20.512
You believe that, don't you?

01:12:25.345 --> 01:12:26.345
Okay.

01:12:28.974 --> 01:12:31.394
You're all I've got, so let's do it.

01:12:54.458 --> 01:12:56.578
Everybody gets a GPS tracker.

01:12:56.627 --> 01:13:00.337
This is gonna tell us
where you are, anytime...

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:03.260
in case anything gets weird.

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:06.140
What am I supposed to do with this?

01:13:06.178 --> 01:13:07.678
Just put it in your pocket.

01:13:22.569 --> 01:13:24.149
Weird, right?

01:13:24.196 --> 01:13:25.406
Yeah.

01:13:25.989 --> 01:13:27.069
What's with the leg?

01:13:27.699 --> 01:13:29.279
I don't know.

01:13:30.577 --> 01:13:32.287
Can you show me how to fly this thing?

01:13:32.955 --> 01:13:34.295
Okay.

01:13:34.331 --> 01:13:36.751
It's kind of complicated.
Do you want me to fly it?

01:13:37.793 --> 01:13:39.423
I can handle it.

01:13:40.754 --> 01:13:43.514
You gonna ask me about it,
or just stare at my leg the whole day?

01:13:44.758 --> 01:13:46.588
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:49.350
Let's just get this over with, shall we?

01:13:49.388 --> 01:13:50.928
What are you doing?

01:13:50.973 --> 01:13:53.683
No, no, no. We don't need to see that.
That's weird.

01:13:54.852 --> 01:13:56.642
- What happened to you?
- What happened to you?

01:13:56.687 --> 01:13:58.557
Portugal, 2003.

01:13:58.605 --> 01:14:01.015
There was a monastery
in the forest of Bussaco...

01:14:01.066 --> 01:14:03.356
with a particularly nasty entity.

01:14:03.402 --> 01:14:05.612
And you got rid of it?

01:14:05.946 --> 01:14:08.906
Not before it took
a piece of my leg with it.

01:14:08.949 --> 01:14:11.159
Okay, thank you for that.
That's gross.

01:14:11.201 --> 01:14:13.501
I'm gonna go throw up. Thanks.

01:14:17.833 --> 01:14:19.133
And what about that one?

01:14:21.295 --> 01:14:23.305
That's a good story.

01:14:23.338 --> 01:14:26.338
Let's save that for
after this is all over, shall we?

01:14:26.925 --> 01:14:28.835
Assuming you don't die.

01:14:32.514 --> 01:14:33.774
Okay.

01:14:35.392 --> 01:14:37.772
- Why do you do that?
- What?

01:14:38.228 --> 01:14:40.148
You tell your old war stories...

01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:42.229
and you make yourself
sound like an old man.

01:14:42.274 --> 01:14:43.444
Comes with the territory.

01:14:43.859 --> 01:14:45.739
We age in dog years.

01:14:45.777 --> 01:14:47.527
Do you have kids, Mr. Burke?

01:14:47.571 --> 01:14:49.071
Sadly, no.

01:14:49.114 --> 01:14:51.994
My wife didn't think it was a good idea
given our line of work.

01:14:52.034 --> 01:14:53.624
It wasn't just the work.

01:14:56.538 --> 01:14:58.828
- The two of you were...
- Briefly.

01:14:58.874 --> 01:15:00.424
We were young and stupid.

01:15:00.459 --> 01:15:01.839
Only one of us was stupid.

01:15:01.877 --> 01:15:05.087
Don't be so hard on yourself.
I was irresistible back then.

01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:07.220
I'm gonna go check
the readings upstairs.

01:15:07.257 --> 01:15:09.837
And she goes,
just like she fled our marriage.

01:15:09.885 --> 01:15:14.105
Straight into the arms of academia.
Safe, stable academia.

01:15:14.139 --> 01:15:15.929
- Still misses me though.
- No, I don't.

01:15:15.974 --> 01:15:17.104
You do, a little.

01:15:17.142 --> 01:15:18.522
No, not even a little bit.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:21.310
She forgets I can sense these things.

01:15:21.355 --> 01:15:23.115
I have special powers, you know.

01:15:23.148 --> 01:15:25.318
They're not that special.

01:15:27.152 --> 01:15:28.152
You all right?

01:15:29.238 --> 01:15:30.528
I'm a little scared.

01:15:30.572 --> 01:15:32.202
Yeah.

01:15:32.241 --> 01:15:33.581
Me too.

01:15:33.617 --> 01:15:36.117
What are we gonna do about that?

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.290
I don't know.

01:15:39.331 --> 01:15:40.501
Think about Maddy?

01:15:40.832 --> 01:15:42.082
Let's try that.

01:15:48.298 --> 01:15:50.258
Feeling less scared?

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:51.630
No, not really.

01:15:52.511 --> 01:15:53.801
Yeah, me neither.

01:15:56.431 --> 01:15:57.681
I feel a little braver, though.

01:15:58.851 --> 01:16:00.231
Me too.

01:16:00.769 --> 01:16:02.229
We're good.

01:16:02.271 --> 01:16:04.311
Brooke, video's up!

01:16:04.648 --> 01:16:06.898
- Let's go.
- We're all set to go down here.

01:16:06.942 --> 01:16:10.282
Kendra, would you ever throw me
that belt that's in that bag there?

01:16:12.614 --> 01:16:15.124
All right, just so we're all clear.

01:16:15.993 --> 01:16:19.833
First, we use the rope to bridge
the way in to the way out.

01:16:22.499 --> 01:16:24.919
The rules are different in there.

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:28.340
There is no up, there is no down...

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:29.840
and there are no straight lines.

01:16:31.675 --> 01:16:34.545
Which is why we have to make one.

01:16:35.262 --> 01:16:37.352
This rope is our lifeline.

01:16:37.389 --> 01:16:42.059
If we let go of it,
we'll never find our way back.

01:16:45.063 --> 01:16:46.483
It worked!

01:16:51.737 --> 01:16:53.277
Once we've done that...

01:16:53.322 --> 01:16:55.572
we send the drone in
to get eyes on Maddy.

01:18:30.752 --> 01:18:33.002
Keep it steady, now.
Keep it steady.

01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:36.011
Keep it steady there, Griffin.

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:40.950
Maddy!

01:19:41.406 --> 01:19:42.406
Maddy?

01:19:44.535 --> 01:19:45.545
Mommy.

01:19:46.411 --> 01:19:47.451
Mommy?

01:19:47.496 --> 01:19:48.496
Maddy.

01:19:49.039 --> 01:19:50.169
Mommy?

01:19:50.916 --> 01:19:52.166
Maddy?

01:19:52.209 --> 01:19:53.749
- Madison, can you hear me?
- Mommy.

01:19:53.794 --> 01:19:55.714
Madison! Madison?

01:19:57.673 --> 01:20:02.433
Madison, honey.
Maddy, sweetheart, it's Mommy.

01:20:02.469 --> 01:20:03.509
Mommy?

01:20:03.554 --> 01:20:04.554
Maddy?

01:20:05.138 --> 01:20:06.138
Daddy?

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.110
Madison! Madison!

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:17.570
- No! I'm going in.
- Listen to me, Eric.

01:20:17.609 --> 01:20:19.859
- I am her mother. I have to go.
- Mom, you can't!

01:20:19.903 --> 01:20:21.153
You're not going in!

01:20:21.196 --> 01:20:24.066
She's too close to the light.
I gotta go in and get her out.

01:20:24.116 --> 01:20:26.076
No, I'm going. You can't go.
She won't come to a stranger.

01:20:26.118 --> 01:20:27.408
You've never done this before.

01:20:27.452 --> 01:20:30.132
- You have no idea what you're dealing with.
- All right, I'm going!

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:34.340
Sort all this out in family therapy.
We've got to get her out of there.

01:20:34.376 --> 01:20:36.496
Wait, everyone, stop!
Griffin is already upstairs.

01:20:36.879 --> 01:20:39.459
Griff! Oh, my God! Griff!

01:20:39.965 --> 01:20:40.975
Griffin!

01:20:44.595 --> 01:20:45.765
Griffin!

01:20:45.804 --> 01:20:48.604
I should have never left her alone.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:50.600
No!

01:20:51.476 --> 01:20:54.096
Griffin! No!

01:21:01.069 --> 01:21:02.899
Griffin!

01:21:03.614 --> 01:21:04.914
Griffin!

01:21:06.158 --> 01:21:07.528
No!

01:21:08.327 --> 01:21:12.037
Go downstairs! Grab ahold of the rope!

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:16.080
When I give you the signal,
pull with all your might!

01:21:16.126 --> 01:21:17.836
What if it doesn't work?

01:21:17.878 --> 01:21:19.048
Amy.

01:21:19.087 --> 01:21:20.377
Sweetheart...

01:21:21.048 --> 01:21:22.878
it's gonna work.

01:21:28.347 --> 01:21:29.507
This better work!

01:21:30.933 --> 01:21:32.773
You said you could
talk to these things, right?

01:21:33.143 --> 01:21:35.563
Tell them it's time to let Maddy go!

01:21:37.439 --> 01:21:38.859
I'm counting on you!

01:21:53.747 --> 01:21:56.497
This child has done you no harm.

01:21:56.542 --> 01:21:58.342
She speaks none harm.

01:22:03.674 --> 01:22:04.974
Wait.

01:22:06.718 --> 01:22:07.718
Wait.

01:22:07.761 --> 01:22:10.931
No, no, no. He's off the screen.
We lost him.

01:22:16.937 --> 01:22:17.937
Maddy?

01:22:24.361 --> 01:22:25.401
Maddy?

01:22:33.495 --> 01:22:34.535
Maddy?

01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:37.540
Griffin?

01:22:54.224 --> 01:22:56.894
Maddy, we have to go.

01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:59.310
I can't.

01:22:59.354 --> 01:23:02.024
Yes, you can.
We have to go now.

01:23:13.744 --> 01:23:16.044
They'll never let me leave.

01:23:19.833 --> 01:23:20.833
The rope!

01:23:27.716 --> 01:23:28.716
The rope!

01:23:42.564 --> 01:23:43.574
Run, Maddy, come on!

01:23:59.289 --> 01:24:01.579
Maddy! Griffin!

01:24:01.917 --> 01:24:02.997
Oh, my God.

01:24:03.043 --> 01:24:05.093
I got you, my babies.
You'll be okay. Oh, my God.

01:24:05.128 --> 01:24:06.548
They have a pulse.

01:24:06.588 --> 01:24:07.838
Eric!

01:24:07.881 --> 01:24:09.971
They're breathing. She's breathing.

01:24:10.008 --> 01:24:11.468
Mommy's right here.

01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:12.640
Jesus! God!

01:24:12.678 --> 01:24:13.968
Are they okay?

01:24:14.221 --> 01:24:16.311
- What do we do?
- Get them in the water now!

01:24:16.348 --> 01:24:17.848
Okay, come on.

01:24:18.183 --> 01:24:19.643
Wake up, baby.

01:24:19.685 --> 01:24:20.945
Okay, sweetheart.

01:24:20.978 --> 01:24:22.518
Come on, baby, wake up.

01:24:22.563 --> 01:24:24.363
Can you hear me?
Can you hear Momma?

01:24:24.398 --> 01:24:25.978
All right, wake up, sweetheart.

01:24:26.024 --> 01:24:27.484
Come on.

01:24:27.526 --> 01:24:29.646
Griffin, please wake up. Please.

01:24:29.695 --> 01:24:32.215
- I'm counting on you, buddy.
- I need you to wake up right now.

01:24:33.198 --> 01:24:34.908
Good boy! Good boy!

01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:36.910
- There he is!
- Is Maddy okay?

01:24:36.952 --> 01:24:38.372
- Yeah, Maddy's okay.
- Is Maddy okay?

01:24:38.412 --> 01:24:39.582
Maddy's gonna be okay.

01:24:39.621 --> 01:24:41.711
- Can you hear Momma?
- Come on, sweetheart.

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.460
Please wake up. Please wake up.

01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:48.840
Oh, sweetheart! Oh, baby!

01:24:48.881 --> 01:24:51.341
Hi, sweetheart. Hi, sweetheart.

01:24:51.383 --> 01:24:53.763
Hi, Mommy. Hi, Daddy.

01:24:53.802 --> 01:24:55.012
Hi.

01:24:55.053 --> 01:24:56.393
Hi, sweetheart.

01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:58.100
It's okay, Mommy.

01:24:58.724 --> 01:25:00.024
Griffin saved me.

01:25:00.058 --> 01:25:02.018
Yeah, he did. You know why?

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:04.230
Because you're our super boy.

01:25:04.271 --> 01:25:05.901
Yeah. Yeah.

01:25:07.566 --> 01:25:09.566
I love you, two. I love you, Daddy.

01:25:10.319 --> 01:25:12.899
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.580
All right, hop in your seat.

01:25:24.625 --> 01:25:26.465
Are we ever coming back?

01:25:26.502 --> 01:25:29.092
No, sweetie. There's no way in hell.

01:25:29.129 --> 01:25:31.129
Okay, seatbelt.

01:25:31.173 --> 01:25:33.553
Hey, thanks for everything...

01:25:34.301 --> 01:25:35.891
and I hope we never see you again.

01:25:36.386 --> 01:25:38.466
I don't know why they always say that.

01:25:38.514 --> 01:25:39.564
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:25:42.476 --> 01:25:45.186
So tell me. I deserve it.

01:25:50.067 --> 01:25:52.777
Burbank, California, 2012.

01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:56.910
We were shooting an episode
in a haunted car wash.

01:25:57.366 --> 01:26:00.696
And the sound guy fell asleep.

01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:03.370
- So, not a ghost?
- No.

01:26:03.413 --> 01:26:08.423
Just a dozy boom operator
with a very, very large microphone.

01:26:12.673 --> 01:26:13.673
Do the line.

01:26:14.091 --> 01:26:15.301
I'm not saying it.

01:26:15.342 --> 01:26:16.892
Mom, it's for Lauren.

01:26:16.927 --> 01:26:18.427
Burke, give her the line!

01:26:19.763 --> 01:26:20.813
The house is clean.

01:26:21.265 --> 01:26:22.315
Better. Come on.

01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:25.690
The house is clean.

01:26:25.727 --> 01:26:27.187
Oh, my God! She's gonna freak.

01:26:28.438 --> 01:26:30.358
"This house is clean."

01:26:30.399 --> 01:26:31.779
It isn't though.

01:26:31.817 --> 01:26:33.437
Of course it is, sweetheart.

01:26:33.485 --> 01:26:35.565
You helped the spirits
go into the light.

01:26:35.612 --> 01:26:37.072
But they didn't.

01:26:38.907 --> 01:26:40.027
- Dad, go!
- Dad, go!

01:26:40.075 --> 01:26:41.865
They didn't go into the light, Mommy.

01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:44.750
They needed me to take them
but I wouldn't go in...

01:26:44.788 --> 01:26:46.458
so neither did they.

01:26:47.249 --> 01:26:48.289
- Dad, go!
- Go!

01:26:53.797 --> 01:26:55.297
Get out of the car.

01:27:30.876 --> 01:27:32.286
Honey, you okay?

01:27:32.878 --> 01:27:34.128
You okay?

01:27:34.171 --> 01:27:35.461
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah.

01:27:35.506 --> 01:27:36.716
Eric. Eric.

01:27:36.757 --> 01:27:38.627
Here, baby. Hold on.

01:27:40.177 --> 01:27:41.177
Where's Maddy?

01:27:42.095 --> 01:27:43.805
Where is she? Where is she?

01:27:43.847 --> 01:27:44.967
Maddy!

01:27:45.516 --> 01:27:46.676
Mommy.

01:27:47.726 --> 01:27:49.726
Something's wrong, Mom.

01:27:52.147 --> 01:27:52.937
Maddy!

01:27:52.981 --> 01:27:54.071
- Oh, God!
- Mom!

01:28:10.415 --> 01:28:11.955
Maddy!

01:28:21.009 --> 01:28:22.679
- Mom! Mom!
- Maddy!

01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:24.390
Mom!

01:28:24.429 --> 01:28:26.059
- Hold on!
- Mom! Mom!

01:28:26.098 --> 01:28:27.928
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:28:27.975 --> 01:28:28.985
Mommy!

01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:32.270
Come on, baby.

01:28:32.646 --> 01:28:33.646
Hold on!

01:28:56.253 --> 01:28:57.883
Pull!

01:28:57.921 --> 01:28:59.551
Pull!

01:29:02.301 --> 01:29:05.141
Release your hold on this family...

01:29:05.179 --> 01:29:07.969
as you yourselves wish to be released...

01:29:21.945 --> 01:29:23.525
No. Don't do something stupid.

01:29:23.572 --> 01:29:26.452
I always do something stupid.
Isn't that why you left me?

01:29:26.491 --> 01:29:27.741
Carrigan, please.

01:29:27.784 --> 01:29:29.834
They're never gonna let this family go.

01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:31.830
I'm tired of faking it
for the cameras, Brooke.

01:29:32.748 --> 01:29:36.078
I'm the only one left who can lead those
souls into the light. You know that.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.170
Wait!

01:29:38.212 --> 01:29:39.882
You don't have to do this.

01:29:39.922 --> 01:29:42.092
I know. I want to.

01:29:42.132 --> 01:29:43.172
Wait.

01:29:43.217 --> 01:29:45.337
How will I know that
you've made it back?

01:29:45.385 --> 01:29:47.425
I'll think of something.

01:29:47.471 --> 01:29:48.561
Bye, Brooke.

01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:56.520
Amy, come here.

01:29:56.813 --> 01:29:58.363
Let's go.

01:30:03.111 --> 01:30:04.451
Maddy!

01:30:04.947 --> 01:30:06.197
Let's go! Come on.

01:30:11.119 --> 01:30:12.199
Watch your head. Let's go.

01:30:12.246 --> 01:30:14.996
Maddy. Okay, let's go.

01:30:23.841 --> 01:30:25.011
Mommy's gonna get you.

01:30:25.050 --> 01:30:26.090
No!

01:30:26.134 --> 01:30:28.554
Kendra! Come here. Let's go!

01:30:28.595 --> 01:30:30.305
I'm sorry I'm such a bitch to you, Dad.

01:30:30.347 --> 01:30:32.507
It's okay, honey.
Can we talk about it later? Let's go.

01:30:38.146 --> 01:30:39.266
Oh, shit.

01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:49.870
Hey!

01:30:49.908 --> 01:30:50.988
What are you doing?

01:30:51.577 --> 01:30:53.447
I've got a job to do!

01:30:53.495 --> 01:30:54.495
Wait!

01:31:04.464 --> 01:31:05.474
Dad!

01:31:14.808 --> 01:31:17.518
Amy, we gotta find a car.

01:31:17.561 --> 01:31:20.361
Eric, take mine. Go!

01:31:25.444 --> 01:31:26.494
Mom!

01:31:31.074 --> 01:31:32.624
Come on! Let's go!

01:32:08.862 --> 01:32:10.992
Dad, is it gonna follow us?

01:32:12.324 --> 01:32:15.374
Griff, don't look back. Don't look back.

01:33:18.891 --> 01:33:20.681
Any sign of him?

01:33:25.063 --> 01:33:27.323
Nothing. The GPS isn't picking him up.

01:33:32.613 --> 01:33:35.123
Wait. We're getting something.

01:33:49.963 --> 01:33:51.383
- Hello!
- Hi.

01:33:51.423 --> 01:33:54.093
Hello! You obviously found it okay.

01:33:54.134 --> 01:33:55.394
Isn't it beautiful?

01:33:55.427 --> 01:33:57.887
I think this one is it.
Great school district...

01:33:57.930 --> 01:34:00.060
the high school ball field's close by.

01:34:00.098 --> 01:34:01.388
Wait till you see the inside.

01:34:01.433 --> 01:34:02.643
Four proper bedrooms...

01:34:02.684 --> 01:34:04.734
and the place is just swimming
in closet space.

01:34:05.938 --> 01:34:07.898
That's not really high on our wish list.

01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:09.940
Our last closet ate me.

01:34:10.359 --> 01:34:12.109
That's sweet.

01:34:13.612 --> 01:34:16.242
Anyway, this house
just screams character.

01:34:16.281 --> 01:34:18.951
Look at the wainscoting.
And in here is the foyer.

01:34:19.284 --> 01:34:21.244
Period detail throughout.

01:34:21.286 --> 01:34:22.616
And this is the den.

01:34:22.663 --> 01:34:25.583
The den leads right into the back yard.
Perfect for the kids.

01:34:25.624 --> 01:34:28.544
And do you see that tree?
It's ancient. It was here before...

01:34:29.127 --> 01:34:30.337
Hello?

01:34:31.505 --> 01:34:32.675
Hello?

01:34:34.633 --> 01:34:35.723
Perfect.

01:34:36.802 --> 01:34:38.472
Let's get out of here.

01:35:31.106 --> 01:35:35.396
Is this labyrinthine network
of sewers playing host...

01:35:35.444 --> 01:35:37.034
to a malevolent spirit?

01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:40.870
I'm Carrigan Burke,
and I'm here to...

01:35:40.908 --> 01:35:43.368
And I'm Brooke Powell,
and we're here to clean house.

01:35:43.410 --> 01:35:45.330
- I hadn't finished!
- I'm sorry. Was that not my cue?

01:35:45.370 --> 01:35:46.540
- I hadn't finished my line.
- I'm sorry.

01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:49.370
And we're not saying "clean house."
We cut that.

01:35:49.416 --> 01:35:52.586
Because I thought that my cue was
when you said, "And I'm Carrigan Burke."

01:35:52.628 --> 01:35:54.418
- I didn't even say that.
- As soon as I heard "and"...

01:35:54.463 --> 01:35:55.593
I just came right out.

01:35:55.631 --> 01:35:57.171
That's the wrong one, though.

01:35:57.216 --> 01:35:58.376
Okay.

01:36:02.221 --> 01:36:04.391
Does someone wanna tell me
the right one?

01:36:05.305 --> 01:36:11.428
