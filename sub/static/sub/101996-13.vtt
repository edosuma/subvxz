"QUIZ BOWL" WAS
THROWING A PARTY

ARTHUR ALWAYS THOUGHT
THE WRITERS DUMBED
DOWN THE QUESTIONS

13:48.958 --> 13:51.352
TO APPEAL TO
A WIDER AUDIENCE, SO...

13:51.395 --> 13:52.875
HE PUT A RIDDLE
IN THE "GAZETTE,"

13:52.919 --> 13:54.703
SAID HE WAS GONNA
BOMB THE PARTY.

13:54.746 --> 13:57.358
SO HOW DID YOU
SOLVE IT?

13:57.401 --> 14:00.361

I DIDN'T.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.798
ALL ROOKIES SPEND

TOLD ME ABOUT THE PUZZLE,
THEN TOLD ME WHAT IT MEANT.

TO FIELD AGENT

ON A GUN MY FIRST YEAR

-IT'S ONE OF HIS PUZZLES.
-EXACTLY.

RELEASE EACH OTHER'S THROATS

-YEAH.

-THAT'S HOW WE GET HER OUT.

OF THOSE TARGETS

IN THIS SPECIFIC
COLOR ORDER.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.268
SOPHIE: TOO EASY.
THE BLOCKS DETACH
FROM THE CHAIN,

16:05.312 --> 16:07.009
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE
PROBABLY NOT IN ORDER.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.229
BESIDES, THOSE SYMBOLS
HAVE TO MEAN SOMETHING.

16:09.272 --> 16:12.972
MARY: OK. ALPHABETICAL
BY ANIMAL THEN?

16:13.015 --> 16:18.151
OK. SO, UH, BIRD
BOBCAT, FLY, AND THEN SPIDER.

16:18.194 --> 16:20.849
BOBCAT? THAT'S A PUMA,
WHICH MEANS IT COMES
AFTER FLY.

16:20.892 --> 16:23.025
IT'S A BOBCAT,
WHICH MEANS IT COMES BEFORE.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.809

HER LIFE ON IT?

DYING IN A BOX. THINK.

16:28.030 --> 16:30.032

IN THE RIGHT ORDER,
WHY CHAIN THEM TOGETHER

17:55.465 --> 17:57.380

ON A TOOTHPICK.

17:57.424 --> 18:00.035
NOW THAT MAKES ME
WANT A MARTINI.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.993

WHO BATWOMAN IS,

18:02.037 --> 18:03.865
AND YOU'LL BE DRINKING
ONE SOON.

18:03.908 --> 18:06.433
HERE'S THE THING.
I COULD,

18:06.476 --> 18:10.089
BUT THEN I WOULDN'T
HAVE THE SATISFACTION
OF KILLING HER MYSELF.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.829
IT'S PERSONAL,
BUT I'VE HAD
LIMITED SUCCESS

18:11.873 --> 18:14.136
WITH MY VENGEANCE GAMES
AS OF LATE,

18:14.180 --> 18:17.139

RATHER...

AT ARKHAM.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.942
SWEET CIRCE SIONIS.

18:37.986 --> 18:41.163
POKED THE BABY BLUES OUT
OF SOME CORPORATE BIGWIG.

18:41.207 --> 18:46.299
MY MOUSE AND I USED TO
CALL HER "CAN'T CEO KILLER."

18:46.342 --> 18:48.997
AHH. MEMORIES.

18:49.040 --> 18:52.000
HE DESERVED IT.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.523
WHO, DEAR?

18:56.483 --> 18:58.659
THE CORPORATE BIGWIG.

18:58.702 --> 19:00.313
HE CROSSED A LINE,
AND I HAD TO MAKE SURE

19:00.356 --> 19:03.490
HE NEVER FOUND
HIS WAY BACK.

19:08.886 --> 19:13.413
YOU. YOU GOUGED
HIS EYEBALLS OUT.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.415
TSK, TSK, TSK, TSK.

19:15.458 --> 19:19.070
WHY, IF IT ISN'T
CIRCE SIONIS.

19:19.114 --> 19:21.508
I HEARD THAT YOU WERE
TRAMPLED TO DEATH

19:21.551 --> 19:23.988
IN THE ARKHAM BREAKOUT.

19:24.032 --> 19:27.775
ON THE CONTRARY.
I WAS RESCUED BY MY FATHER.

19:27.818 --> 19:29.994
AND DID YOU GET
THOSE HORRIFIC BURNS

19:30.038 --> 19:33.694
BEFORE OR AFTER
DADDY SAVED YOU?

19:36.262 --> 19:38.002
TOUCHY SUBJECT?

19:38.046 --> 19:39.700
ENOUGH ABOUT ME.

19:41.528 --> 19:44.748
IT'S TIME TO TALK
ABOUT BATWOMAN.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.273
BRING ME BLACK MASK.

19:49.884 --> 19:53.975
I'LL TELL HIM EXACTLY
WHAT HE WANTS TO HEAR.

19:54.018 --> 19:56.195
RYAN: SO YOU WOKE UP
TO DISCOVER

19:56.238 --> 19:59.850
YOU WERE COVERED
IN SOME CODED MESSAGE?

19:59.894 --> 20:01.374
STEPHANIE: YOU SAY THAT
LIKE YOUR DAD DOESN'T WRITE

20:01.417 --> 20:03.114
CRYPTOGRAMS ON YOU
WHILE YOU'RE UNCONSCIOUS.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.247
GOT TO BE A CLUE
TO HIS NEXT MOVE.

20:05.291 --> 20:08.598
SPOILER ALERT--HIS NEXT MOVE
IS KILLING YOU, AGENT MOORE.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.123
I SWEAR WHEN I ASKED
YOU TO COVER FOR ME

20:12.167 --> 20:14.648
I HAD NO IDEA HE'D BECOME
SO OBSESSED WITH YOU.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.215
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.956
HOLD UP. YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO SOLVED

20:19.000 --> 20:21.045
CLUEMASTER'S PUZZLE
BACK IN THE DAY?

20:21.089 --> 20:24.223
AGENT MOORE TOOK
THE BULLET.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.007
THERE'S GOT TO BE
A KEY BUILT IN.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.791
IF I CAN FIND THE KEY,
I CAN CRACK THE MESSAGE

20:27.835 --> 20:29.619
AND STOP HIM BEFORE HE MAKES
HIS MOVE ON YOU.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.621
WHY WOULD YOUR DAD
DO THIS TO YOU?

20:31.665 --> 20:33.232
I GREW UP TRYING
TO SOLVE HIS PUZZLES.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.059
AS I GOT BETTER,
HE USED ME AS A BAROMETER.

20:35.103 --> 20:37.714
IF I COULDN'T SOLVE THEM,
THEY WERE GOOD,

20:37.758 --> 20:40.282
SO THIS MORNING
AFTER HE FLEW THE COOP,

20:40.326 --> 20:42.589
HE PAID ME A VISIT.

20:42.632 --> 20:44.373
HE THOUGHT I'D BE
HIS PARTNER IN CRIME,

20:44.417 --> 20:46.723
TRIED TO ENLIST ME
IN HIS LITTLE REVENGE SCHEME.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.769
HE SAID THAT IT TOOK
EINSTEIN 10 YEARS

20:48.812 --> 20:50.423
TO CRACK GENERAL RELATIVITY,

20:50.466 --> 20:53.339
SO HE WANTED HIS MASTERPIECE
TO TAKE HALF THAT TIME.

20:53.382 --> 20:55.079
5 YEARS,

20:55.123 --> 20:57.081
HENCE THE FIFTH
ANNIVERSARY OF ME
ARRESTING HIM.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.519
HE SAID NOW HE CAN FINALLY
FINISH WHAT HE STARTED.

20:59.562 --> 21:01.347
MARY: AND LET ME GUESS.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.740
WE WON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS UNTIL
YOU CRACK THAT THING,

21:03.784 --> 21:06.265
WHICH IS WHEN?

21:06.308 --> 21:08.092
JUST ME? I DON'T KNOW.

21:08.136 --> 21:10.965
IT COULD TAKE HOURS,
IT COULD TAKE DAYS.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.360
WHAT IF THERE WERE
TWO OF YOU?

21:14.403 --> 21:15.839
IT'S A CRYPTOGRAM.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.276
WELL, THANKS
FROM LAST YEAR.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.278
THOUGHT YOU GUYS SAID HE
WAS A HUMAN COMPUTER.

21:19.321 --> 21:21.105
WHERE'S THE RAM?

21:21.149 --> 21:23.934
I'M SORRY.
WHO ARE YOU EXACTLY?

21:23.978 --> 21:26.154
SEE IF YOU CAN
FIGURE IT OUT.

21:26.197 --> 21:29.288
I'M SMARTER THAN MY KING.
MY TECHNOLOGY PROTECTS WAKANDA.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.767
YOUR NAME IS SHURI?

21:30.811 --> 21:33.988
AW. YOU THINK IT'D BE
AS EASY AS KISSING A FROG.
