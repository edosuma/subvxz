[Maria] <i>I'm a pterodactyl.</i>

00:21.272 --> 00:24.234
Maria, now that you're never doing
stand-up anymore,

00:24.317 --> 00:27.195
I have some opportunities
from overseas.

00:27.278 --> 00:30.490
I said I didn't wanna use
stand-up as a device in the show.

00:30.573 --> 00:32.366
I'm still gonna do it in my life.

00:32.450 --> 00:33.868
-Yes, I understand completely.
-Yeah, okay, good.

00:33.952 --> 00:35.119
-We're on the same page.
-Great. Good.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.497
You want to do stand-up,
no more commercials.

00:37.580 --> 00:39.165
No, that's not what I'm saying.

00:39.249 --> 00:42.168
So, then you'd be open to looking
at some commercials?

00:42.252 --> 00:43.419
-Sure.
-Wonderful.

00:43.503 --> 00:45.755
[Bruce] This is their current campaign.

00:45.838 --> 00:47.590
Now, just imagine yourself in this.

00:48.341 --> 00:49.968
Input one or two, Chantrelle?

00:50.760 --> 00:52.470
Input two!

[Bruce] They want you

01:29.257 --> 01:32.010
to be the face of the new campaign.
They assured me,

01:32.093 --> 01:33.344
many, many times,

01:33.428 --> 01:35.972
-it's going to be much more violent.
-It's a no.

01:36.055 --> 01:37.181
Too close to your act?

01:38.391 --> 01:41.185
It is not in any way related to my act.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.563
-You're saying that's a pass?
-Yes!

01:43.688 --> 01:44.689
[laughs]

01:45.356 --> 01:48.901
I'll make note to myself,
"As per Maria, too close to act."

01:48.985 --> 01:52.322
You know what? I gotta go.
I've gotta get out of a date.

01:52.405 --> 01:54.991
You're good at that.
Nobody says no like you.

01:55.074 --> 01:57.535
[Maria] <i>Look, Bruce meant well... I think.</i>

01:57.619 --> 01:58.911
<i>But I've learnt to be cautious.</i>

01:58.995 --> 02:02.206
<i>His past career choices for me</i>
<i>haven't always been so great.</i>

02:02.290 --> 02:05.710

Mr. Sir, Mr. Sir,

02:16.804 --> 02:19.057
And for the tiniest Mr. Sir,

02:19.140 --> 02:20.350
your formula...

02:20.433 --> 02:21.851
for success!

02:22.977 --> 02:25.563
[baby in gruff voice] Formula?
I want fresh milk!

02:25.647 --> 02:27.649
But I hope you got a cow in the back,

02:27.732 --> 02:30.610
'cause you're getting nothin'
out of those two dustbags.

02:30.693 --> 02:32.362
Come on, fellas, am I right?

02:32.445 --> 02:33.946
[all laughing]

02:36.240 --> 02:39.577
Just because you're a baby
doesn't make that okay.

02:39.661 --> 02:40.870
[audience] Ooh!

02:40.953 --> 02:43.539
You're just an adorable
representation of misogyny.

02:43.623 --> 02:47.001
Let's lock you in a room for 12 hours
with no food and you'd be

02:47.085 --> 02:49.837
begging for these
slammin' mammary jammers.

02:49.921 --> 02:51.756
[audience laughing]

02:56.636 --> 02:59.222
And what about you?

02:59.305 --> 03:01.516
You okay with this?
Hiding your sexist agenda

03:01.599 --> 03:04.894
behind these cute, chubby cheeks?

03:04.977 --> 03:06.396
I got no problem with this baby.

03:06.479 --> 03:08.356
You're caught in the system, and that,

03:08.439 --> 03:09.982
my tiny little friend...

03:10.066 --> 03:11.692
is the banality of evil!

[crying]

03:16.906 --> 03:18.950
-[woman] That's a cut.
-[bell rings]

03:19.033 --> 03:21.869
Get the guns and weapons ready
for the sock hop scene.

03:21.953 --> 03:24.414
One take. [squeals softly]

03:24.497 --> 03:27.750
That's so great. Yes, yeah, yes!

03:27.834 --> 03:30.128
-Ah, wow. [laughing]
-Oh, my gosh.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.088
It was dynamite. How'd you feel?

03:32.171 --> 03:37.135
I felt great.
And you were right about ad-libbing.

03:37.218 --> 03:41.514
It's like I can be in a dumb, sexist show,
but Trojan-horse it, you know?

03:41.597 --> 03:42.849
Criticize from within.

03:42.932 --> 03:45.351
That's it. You spoke the truth to power.

03:45.435 --> 03:47.562
-Yeah!
-And power fired you.

03:48.479 --> 03:51.399
What? They fired me? Why?

03:51.482 --> 03:52.817
To quote them exactly,

03:52.900 --> 03:55.361
they said they hate everything about you.

03:55.445 --> 04:00.533
They hate your humor and your physicality,
and... your stupid fucking face.

04:01.409 --> 04:05.955
Oh. Okay. So, I'm fired. I can go home?

04:06.038 --> 04:08.332
No. I wouldn't let 'em get away with that.

04:08.416 --> 04:11.461
I said you're gonna stay
and finish out the day. [chuckles]

04:11.544 --> 04:14.756
Oh, cool. [laughing nervously]

04:14.839 --> 04:15.965
Yeah.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.010
Okay.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.803
-Maria!
-Karen! Hi.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.473
I heard you got <i>Baby on Board.</i>

04:23.556 --> 04:26.058
I rep Camden, the baby.
He's a real piece of shit.

04:26.142 --> 04:27.226
-How's it goin'?

04:27.310 --> 04:29.228
I just got fired. Bruce worked it

04:29.312 --> 04:31.981
so that I can stay and finish my scenes.

04:32.064 --> 04:33.107
[yells] What?

04:33.191 --> 04:34.859
That gimpy thundercunt.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.028
Making you work after you got shitcocked?

04:37.111 --> 04:38.237

04:40.782 --> 04:42.450
Here's 100 bucks. This never happened.

04:43.159 --> 04:45.912
I get upset when people
I love get taken advantage of.

04:45.995 --> 04:48.623
I'd say Bruce fucked you
if he wasn't so dickless.

04:48.706 --> 04:51.709
I wish I was your representative,
not your best friend.

04:51.793 --> 04:53.961
I just have so many goddamn clients.

04:54.462 --> 04:58.216
You know what? Fuck it.
I'm gonna make room for you.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.176
I'm gonna sign the shit out of you.

05:00.259 --> 05:02.887
-[gasping]
-I'm gonna get you on board, baby.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.388
[laughs] See what I did there?

05:04.472 --> 05:07.809
-I just spun it.
-Really? I'd love for you to represent me.

05:07.892 --> 05:09.185
That's great news! Know what?

05:09.268 --> 05:11.604
Helen Hunt's a survivor.
She'll land on her feet.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.481
-You represent her?
-Not anymore.

05:13.564 --> 05:15.441
[sighing and laughing]

05:15.525 --> 05:17.235
Welcome. Come on, I'm a hugger.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.954

05:28.037 --> 05:29.664

05:29.747 --> 05:32.625
I have so much to go over
with you, assistant-wise.

05:32.708 --> 05:33.793
Actually, I have something

05:33.876 --> 05:35.545
-I need--
-[Larissa] Quick confirm.

05:35.628 --> 05:36.796
Shane wants to meet at 7:30.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.506
That's what we need to talk about.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.759
Oh, and FYI,
I'm trying out a new nickname.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.678
I did some numerology work.

05:43.761 --> 05:46.681
It turns out La-La
is a better number name for me.

05:46.764 --> 05:48.391
-Larissa, listen--
-It's La-La.

05:48.474 --> 05:50.101
Okay, La-La, listen.

05:50.184 --> 05:52.853
I don't want to go out with Shane

05:52.937 --> 05:55.314
and I need you to cancel the date.

05:55.398 --> 05:56.732
I just got back in town

05:56.816 --> 06:00.486
and I'm trying to be more selective
about the choices I'm making

06:00.570 --> 06:02.363
and you say he's a meth addict.

06:02.446 --> 06:06.450
Former meth addict.
I think they prefer the term 'tweaker.'

06:06.534 --> 06:07.910
And he's bisexual.

06:07.994 --> 06:09.161
The total package.

06:09.245 --> 06:13.040
That's totally cool he's bisexual.
No judgment.

06:13.124 --> 06:15.710
It's just...
it may be a little too complicated.

06:15.793 --> 06:18.337
Too much for me right now. I can't do it.

06:18.421 --> 06:21.132
I was just trying to help out
my friend Shane,

06:21.215 --> 06:23.301
the brother of my Reiki teacher Lilith,

06:23.384 --> 06:25.511
who is going through a super shitty time.

06:25.595 --> 06:28.848
But what do I know?
I mean, who am I to assist anyone?

06:28.931 --> 06:30.349
And you don't like my new nickname.

06:30.433 --> 06:32.059
I La-La love it.

06:32.143 --> 06:34.520
Oh, my God, that was so forced.
It's pathetic.

06:34.645 --> 06:38.274
You know what? Today just might end
with me having a peanut.

06:38.357 --> 06:40.151
No. You'll go into anaphylactic shock.

06:40.234 --> 06:41.944
Isn't that what everyone wants?

06:42.028 --> 06:43.654
-No!
-For me to stop breathing?

06:43.738 --> 06:44.780
Yes!

06:44.864 --> 06:46.741
-I'll go out with him.
-Okay, great.

06:46.824 --> 06:48.618
7:30, Switch Hitters.

06:48.701 --> 06:50.703
-Switch Hitters?
-Yes, Maria.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.163
Get ready to swallow...

06:53.331 --> 06:54.957
[chuckles] delicious food!

[Maria] <i>It looks like I crumbled there.</i>

06:59.378 --> 07:02.423
<i>But that's not what happened.</i>
<i>I just don't like conflict.</i>

07:02.506 --> 07:04.842
<i>It's only one date.</i>
<i>How bad could it be?</i>

07:04.925 --> 07:08.304
<i>A handshake, a smile, and it's over.</i>
<i>Just like high school.</i>

07:08.387 --> 07:09.639
Shane. Hi.

07:10.681 --> 07:13.267
Oh. Okay. Sorry.

07:13.351 --> 07:15.436
-Maria. Hi. I'm Shane.
-Oh, my gosh. Wow.

07:15.519 --> 07:16.687
Nice to meet you.

07:16.812 --> 07:20.358
[chuckling nervously] Wow.

07:20.441 --> 07:21.484
I know what you were thinking.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.402
Asking you to go to Switch Hitters...

07:24.695 --> 07:26.238
"I don't wanna date a baseball guy."

07:26.322 --> 07:27.490
[both laughing]

07:28.658 --> 07:31.911
So, Larissa says that you think
you're really funny

07:31.994 --> 07:33.746
and you have a lot of mental illness.

07:34.664 --> 07:36.040
That's how she described me?

07:36.123 --> 07:37.291
-Yeah.
-Wow.

07:37.375 --> 07:39.669
You must feel pressure
to be funny all the time.

07:39.752 --> 07:41.295
Not really.

07:41.379 --> 07:44.090
Yeah. Comedians
don't always have to be on,

07:44.173 --> 07:46.467
but you also wanna give
more than Rob Reiner.

07:46.550 --> 07:47.677
Not to trash an ex.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.388
Rob Reiner is an ex?

07:50.471 --> 07:52.264
Ex-client. I used to be a trainer.

07:52.348 --> 07:54.642
-Oh, okay.
-He never wiped down a machine.

07:54.725 --> 07:55.935
[both laughing]

07:56.852 --> 07:59.981
I don't know if Larissa told you
I've been through a tough time.

08:00.064 --> 08:01.357
-Yeah.
-I can't remember

08:01.440 --> 08:02.942
the last time I was straight
in a restaurant.

08:03.025 --> 08:06.404
Yeah, I was gonna ask you about that.
How does that work?

08:06.487 --> 08:08.739
Well, mostly I take it in my mouth.

08:09.865 --> 08:14.286
Sometimes, I get in the shower,
get all hot and sit on it.

08:14.370 --> 08:15.663
In a pinch, I snort it.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.290
Oh. Oh!

08:19.583 --> 08:22.086
I thought Larissa told you
I had a drug problem...

08:22.169 --> 08:23.671
Yes. Yes.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.506
Which led to reckless behavior.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.300
-Specifically with men.
-Yeah.

08:28.384 --> 08:30.720
No need to explain. I totally get it.

08:30.803 --> 08:33.389
I did a lot I'm not proud of
because of meth.

08:34.140 --> 08:36.767
But that's the past.
That's not who I am.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.270
If it bothers you, I understand.

08:39.352 --> 08:43.607
Well... I've been in a psych ward
three times in the past year.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.609
And that does not define me.

08:45.693 --> 08:48.612
That's what I hate,
when people think that's all you are.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.531
-Yeah.
-Addiction is an illness.

08:50.614 --> 08:51.824
I am not my illness.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.534
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

08:54.994 --> 08:56.579
[chuckles]

08:56.662 --> 08:58.164
You know what? It's so funny.

08:58.247 --> 09:01.917
I was gonna cancel this date
but I am... so glad I didn't.

09:02.001 --> 09:03.711
I'm so glad you didn't, too.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.337
[both laughing]

09:09.550 --> 09:13.679
[Maria] <i>Here was a great guy </i>
<i>that I almost missed out on.</i>

09:13.763 --> 09:15.181
<i>Maybe my gut is still off.</i>

09:15.264 --> 09:18.642
<i>I went to look for</i>
<i>the one person I should be trusting more.</i>

09:18.726 --> 09:21.395
<i>-A guy I pay to know what's right for me.</i>
-Bruce!

09:22.313 --> 09:23.397
Hey!

09:24.315 --> 09:25.483
Bruce?

09:31.614 --> 09:33.032
Bruce!

09:36.077 --> 09:37.369
[Bruce groans]

09:42.708 --> 09:43.709
[Maria] Bruce!

09:45.920 --> 09:47.546
Bruce! [stammers]

09:47.630 --> 09:48.881
Why are you running?

09:48.964 --> 09:52.259
[panting] Maria... I'm so glad.
I thought it was security.

09:52.343 --> 09:56.055
I've been calling myself a drive-on
as Cheryl Tiegs for 27 years.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.348
They're bound to catch me.

09:59.850 --> 10:02.770
Bruce, I owe you an apology.

10:02.853 --> 10:05.564
I just had this great date with a guy

10:05.648 --> 10:09.318
who I thought was all wrong for me,
or so I thought.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.779
And who, pray tell,
was this gentleman caller?

10:11.862 --> 10:14.907
Well, he's a formerly
meth-fueled bisexual,

10:14.990 --> 10:17.118
now straight and straight.

10:17.201 --> 10:20.162
I'm certainly in no position
to be judging that gentleman.

10:20.246 --> 10:22.498
You should have seen me back in the '80s.

10:24.959 --> 10:26.502
[gasping] You were on meth?

10:26.585 --> 10:29.088
No, I played a homeless
street drummer on <i>Fall Guy.</i>

10:29.171 --> 10:30.381
Wow.

10:30.464 --> 10:34.343
It just got me thinking,
what else have I been saying no to?

10:34.426 --> 10:37.012
Did I walk away too quickly
from Pussy Noodle?

10:37.096 --> 10:39.765
And what about wedge shoes
and those culottes

10:39.849 --> 10:41.308
that... sag?

10:41.392 --> 10:43.018
I can't speak to the culottes,

10:43.102 --> 10:45.312
but I am super-jazzed
about your excitement

10:45.396 --> 10:47.106

10:48.274 --> 10:49.567

-Yes. Uh, August 3rd, 2006.

Okay, guys, that's it!
Guys! Focus, concentrate!

11:49.668 --> 11:54.381
Whoo! I had a major breakthrough
in music therapy.

11:54.465 --> 11:59.595
I don't need to go to outpatient therapy
because I am the C-word, I am cured!

I don't have to go back again!
Thank you!

12:02.556 --> 12:05.726

did Janice actually say that to you?

12:07.186 --> 12:08.604
Not with words.

12:08.687 --> 12:12.399
But with song,
I give you the gift of music!

20:02.869 --> 20:06.081
Oh! I'm having lots
of complicated feelings right now.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.708
I thought you were going home.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.836
I was, but then, I was feeling
so comfortable on our date,

20:10.919 --> 20:12.838
and I thought I'm holding myself back.

20:12.921 --> 20:15.882
I thought, what is fear?
False evidence appearing real.

20:15.966 --> 20:20.262
I don't want to fuck everything and run.
I wanna face everything and recover.

20:20.345 --> 20:22.973
I grabbed my workbook.
I thought we could go through it.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.100
And then maybe I... You could...

20:25.183 --> 20:27.060
sign something.
We could spend the night.

20:27.144 --> 20:29.855
But now I feel weird,
and I bid you goodnight.

20:29.980 --> 20:31.440
Maria...

20:31.523 --> 20:33.984
I thought you were
cool with bisexuals.

20:34.067 --> 20:37.487
No, I am. I'm LGBTQ, exclamation point.

20:37.571 --> 20:40.615
It's just that I saw you
with another person.

20:40.699 --> 20:41.783
-The waiter?
-Yeah.

20:41.867 --> 20:43.910
He means nothing to me.
That's just sport.

20:43.994 --> 20:45.954
I don't do this
in a committed relationship.

20:46.037 --> 20:49.833
I mean, do you wanna be
in a committed relationship?

20:52.002 --> 20:53.128
Yes.

21:04.973 --> 21:06.057
What the hell is this?

21:06.141 --> 21:07.726
-You kidding me, Shane?
-God!

21:07.809 --> 21:08.935
Gabriel.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.188
[Maria] Who is that?

21:11.313 --> 21:13.857
I might as well admit it.
I have a boyfriend.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.150
Gabriel's my boyfriend.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.611
What about the other guy?

21:17.694 --> 21:19.488
I cheated on Gabriel.
I'd never do that to you.

21:19.571 --> 21:21.323
-You're the only woman in my life.
-Oh.

21:21.406 --> 21:22.491
-[cell phone chimes]
-[Shane] Shit.

21:22.574 --> 21:24.701
-A text from Gabriel.
-From the bathroom?

21:24.785 --> 21:27.662
Ew! What does he say?

21:27.746 --> 21:30.707
"Who is he?"
Oh, God, he thinks you're a man.

21:30.791 --> 21:32.751
He'd be fine if you were a woman.

21:32.834 --> 21:33.835
I am a woman.

21:33.919 --> 21:34.961
I know that.

21:35.045 --> 21:36.463
It's Gabriel you have to convince.

21:36.546 --> 21:37.547
-[knocking]
-Gabriel.

21:37.631 --> 21:40.509
-Who's there?
-[stutters] Orange.

21:40.592 --> 21:41.843
[Gabriel] Orange, who?

21:41.927 --> 21:43.970
Orange you glad I have a vagina?

21:44.054 --> 21:46.014
-Go away, you guys.
-[Maria] I'm not a guy.

21:46.097 --> 21:48.767
I can show you my south mouth,
if you come out.

21:48.850 --> 21:51.269
-Oh, pull your pants up.
-[Maria] Okay.

21:51.394 --> 21:52.395
[Shane] Gabriel...

21:52.479 --> 21:54.856
Hi. I'm Maria.

21:54.940 --> 21:57.692
<i>Enchantée</i>. Thank you
so much for the pastries.

21:58.652 --> 22:00.070
What the fuck is your problem?

22:00.153 --> 22:01.655
What's your problem?
She's a woman.

22:01.738 --> 22:03.573
-She'll show you her snootch.
-Yes.

22:03.657 --> 22:04.866
Shane, you stupid fuck!

22:04.950 --> 22:08.036
I don't give a shit if this is a man,
or a woman,

22:08.119 --> 22:09.871
or a fucking Samoyed Husky mix.

22:09.955 --> 22:12.833
[dog] Hey, not cool! [whines]

22:12.916 --> 22:14.417
We have our relationship.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.127
She's my woman relationship.

22:16.211 --> 22:17.546
I'm bisexual.

22:17.629 --> 22:19.172
That's not what it means.

22:19.256 --> 22:23.635
I know exactly what you're going through.
I just went through it myself.

22:23.718 --> 22:27.180
I walked in on Shane
being blown by our baby waiter.

22:27.264 --> 22:28.598
You got blown by a waiter?

22:28.682 --> 22:30.809
Barely. He had just gotten started.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.394
I deserve more.

22:32.477 --> 22:35.105
Shane... you and I are over.

22:35.188 --> 22:36.314
[Maria softly] Oh.

22:36.398 --> 22:39.234
This guy's a piece of shit.
Are you gonna stay with him?

22:40.735 --> 22:43.863
Oh, come on!
Where's your self-esteem, Maria?

22:43.947 --> 22:44.990
Okay.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.033
You know what's funny?

22:47.117 --> 22:50.036
I started this show
thinking that I couldn't trust my gut

22:50.120 --> 22:52.747
when I didn't want to go out
with a bisexual addict,

22:52.831 --> 22:56.042
or do a violent, castrating
Japanese ramen commercial.

22:56.126 --> 23:00.880
But now I am forced to trust my gut
and make a decision on my own.

23:00.964 --> 23:02.048
On my own!

23:02.132 --> 23:06.511
What will it be, Maria?
We are all waiting.

23:06.595 --> 23:08.346
You make choice now?

23:09.180 --> 23:11.933
-Who are you?
-I am the host.

23:12.017 --> 23:14.019
-[upbeat music playing]

23:18.356 --> 23:22.319
Shane here
wants to have pussy and noodle.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.988
But there must be a decision.

23:26.114 --> 23:27.198
Maria...

23:28.199 --> 23:30.577
will you offer pussy to Shane?

23:31.828 --> 23:35.123
Well... I used to put all my trust
in Karen Grisham.

23:35.206 --> 23:37.042
-That didn't work out.
-[buzzer buzzes]

23:37.125 --> 23:39.252
Then I put all my trust in Bruce,

23:39.336 --> 23:41.588
-and that didn't work either.
-[buzzer buzzes]

23:41.671 --> 23:46.676
Now I have to put my trust in myself...
and that is scary.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.137
So... my decision is...

23:49.971 --> 23:53.099
Shane... I will...

23:55.143 --> 23:56.811
not give you my pussy.

23:56.895 --> 23:58.688
-[audience gasps]
-[Maria] Because I have

23:58.772 --> 24:01.983
self a-steam.

24:02.067 --> 24:04.402
-Pussy Noodles!
-[all cheering]

24:05.654 --> 24:07.447
Maria, you did it!

24:07.530 --> 24:09.407
You have self-esteem!

24:09.491 --> 24:11.201
You make win!

24:11.284 --> 24:12.702
Yay!
