Okay, Nash, a man's dead.

00:46.514 --> 00:47.981
We picked up a guy loitering

around the crime scene.

Looks like a real deviant.

Hi. Did you know the modern

handcuff was invented in 1812?

01:22.283 --> 01:23.284
Is he talking at least?

You didn't know this?

The polygraph test is 100%

01:48.309 --> 01:50.244
old-timey pseudo-science.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.845
You know, back in the Dark Ages

01:51.845 --> 01:53.046
they would force criminals to

01:53.046 --> 01:54.415
hold a red-hot iron to see

01:54.415 --> 01:55.483
if it burned them.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.984
If it did, it meant you were

01:56.984 --> 01:57.818
lying.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.663
Humans are complicated.

02:09.663 --> 02:10.998
The truth isn't something you

02:10.998 --> 02:13.234
can just detect with a machine.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.402
Oh, yeah?

02:14.402 --> 02:16.504
Then what's it detecting, buddy?

02:41.195 --> 02:42.363
have to do to beat the test

03:15.996 --> 03:16.897
Hate to break it to you,

03:16.897 --> 03:18.632
but even the inventor of

03:18.632 --> 03:20.334
the polygraph thought it was BS.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.769
Hey, slimeball, sit down

03:21.769 --> 03:23.070
or I'm calling for backup!

03:23.070 --> 03:24.338
The only backup we'll need

03:24.338 --> 03:27.975
today is from scholarly sources.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.343
(groans)

03:29.343 --> 03:30.644
The polygraph was invented

03:30.644 --> 03:33.113
in 1921 by a medical student

03:33.113 --> 03:35.082
named John Larson.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.817
I will never regret

03:36.817 --> 03:37.951
inventing this.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.320
He would go on to regret

03:39.320 --> 03:40.254
inventing it.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.989
Larson became so horrified by

03:41.989 --> 03:43.591
law enforcement's unscientific

03:43.591 --> 03:45.025
use of his device he would go on

03:45.025 --> 03:46.427
to call the machine a

03:46.427 --> 03:47.961
"Frankenstein's monster".

03:47.961 --> 03:49.297
(thunder cracking)

03:49.297 --> 03:50.464
Stop it!

03:50.464 --> 03:51.932
It's a lie!

03:51.932 --> 03:55.135
It's a lie!

03:55.135 --> 03:56.604
Damn it.

03:56.604 --> 03:57.605
But no one listened,

03:57.605 --> 03:59.106
and ever since people have

03:59.106 --> 04:00.441
insisted that the polygraph

04:00.441 --> 04:02.042
can do frankly impossible

04:02.042 --> 04:02.876
things.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.545
In the late 1960s a polygraph

04:04.545 --> 04:06.280
expert conducted tests on plants

04:06.280 --> 04:07.080
and concluded...

04:07.114 --> 04:08.716
Good gravy, this plant

04:08.716 --> 04:10.451
can feel emotions like pain

04:10.451 --> 04:11.485
and fear.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.353
...instead of the more

04:12.353 --> 04:13.287
obvious conclusion--

04:13.287 --> 04:14.988
Good gravy, this machine is

04:15.022 --> 04:16.957
a piece of garbage that goes off

04:16.957 --> 04:18.359
randomly.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.194
Okay, pea brain, if it's

04:21.194 --> 04:22.530
garbage why do so many people

04:22.530 --> 04:23.531
trust it?

04:23.531 --> 04:25.032
Yeah, I wonder why.

04:25.065 --> 04:25.999
They say that she's

04:25.999 --> 04:27.000
cooperating, but when the mom

04:27.000 --> 04:28.402
won't take a polygraph to me

04:28.402 --> 04:30.704
that raises some red flags.

04:30.704 --> 04:31.705
He's lying.

04:31.705 --> 04:32.640
During your relationship,

04:32.640 --> 04:33.474
have you ever had sexual

04:33.474 --> 04:34.542
intercourse with another woma?

04:34.542 --> 04:35.976
You said no; the lie detector

04:35.976 --> 04:37.478
test determined that was a li.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.380
(crowd gasping and reacting)

04:39.413 --> 04:41.148
The media has pushed the

04:41.148 --> 04:42.516
"infallibility" of the lie

04:42.516 --> 04:44.318
detector so hard that now

04:44.318 --> 04:45.919
everyone believes in it,

04:45.919 --> 04:47.388
even though it just straight-up

04:47.388 --> 04:49.156
doesn't work, and this thing is

04:49.156 --> 04:50.257
still embedded in our legal

04:50.257 --> 04:51.024
system.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.259
Massachusetts uses it to

04:52.259 --> 04:53.661
establish probable cause.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.729
Florida requires sex offenders

04:55.729 --> 04:56.697
to take the test.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.499
Combined, government agencies

04:58.499 --> 05:01.201
test over 70,000 people a year

05:01.201 --> 05:03.003
with this century-old piece

05:03.003 --> 05:04.505
of pseudo-science.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.906
Listen, Conover, you want

05:05.906 --> 05:06.940
to know the truth?

05:06.940 --> 05:08.342
We know it doesn't work.

05:08.342 --> 05:09.743
We just use it to trick gullible

05:09.743 --> 05:11.111
criminals who think it works

05:11.111 --> 05:12.212
into giving confessions.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.280
Are you happy now?

05:13.280 --> 05:14.415
Yeah, I am, 'cause now

05:14.415 --> 05:15.616
everyone knows that, so you

05:15.616 --> 05:16.750
can't trick 'em anymore.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.285
Listen, (bleep) bird!

05:18.285 --> 05:20.187
This just in--

05:20.187 --> 05:22.022
an eyewitness spotted this bozo

05:22.022 --> 05:23.357
at the crime scene.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.225
Son, you better put on your

05:25.225 --> 05:26.927
reading glasses...

05:26.927 --> 05:28.228
'cause we're throwing the book

05:28.228 --> 05:30.197
at you.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.365
Ooh, good twist.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.866
Too bad eyewitness testimony

05:32.866 --> 05:34.935
is completely unreliable.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.571
(groaning)

05:41.108 --> 05:42.543
When it comes to the truth,

05:42.543 --> 05:44.712
our memories can't be trusted.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.046
That's insane!

06:00.293 --> 06:01.094
Can I get you folks

06:01.094 --> 06:01.795
something?

06:01.795 --> 06:02.830
Yeah, pour me a glass of

06:02.830 --> 06:04.398
the truth.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.298
Detective Nash,

06:05.298 --> 06:07.134
Detective Cormac, LAPD

06:07.134 --> 06:08.636
Special Murder Unit.

06:08.636 --> 06:09.470
Mind if we ask you some

06:09.470 --> 06:10.571
questions?

06:10.571 --> 06:11.739
Not as long as I can keep

06:11.739 --> 06:12.773
doing visually interesting

06:12.773 --> 06:14.007
tasks.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.009
Yeah, go ahead.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.445
What did you see in the alley

06:17.445 --> 06:18.479
last night?

06:18.479 --> 06:19.513
Well, I remember crystal

06:19.513 --> 06:21.482
clear: there was a stylish dude

06:21.482 --> 06:23.951
with a tall haircut, shot a man

06:23.951 --> 06:24.818
broad daylight.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.187
It was wild.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.288
This the guy?

06:30.157 --> 06:30.824
Oh, yeah, that's him,

06:30.824 --> 06:34.194
all right, and this is you.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.295
Good enough for me.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.163
Yeah, me too.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.765
Well, it shouldn't be.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.166
We think of our memories as

06:39.166 --> 06:40.668
perfect recordings, but the fact

06:40.668 --> 06:42.670
is even your most cherished

06:42.670 --> 06:44.104
childhood recollections are

06:44.104 --> 06:45.839
just garbled stories your brain

06:45.839 --> 06:47.107
is telling itself.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.277
I find that hard to believe.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.012
Oh, allow me to demonstrate.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.380
Detective Nash, what's your most

06:53.380 --> 06:54.715
cherished childhood memory.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.517
Oh, I remember it like it was

06:56.517 --> 06:58.852
yesterday: the school play.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.153
It was called "The Spooky

07:00.153 --> 07:01.154
Halloween".

07:01.154 --> 07:02.890
I was playing Officer Ghostly.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.458
(chuckles) The theater was

07:04.458 --> 07:05.526
packed.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.060
I was nervous but I hit the

07:07.060 --> 07:09.663
stage and delivered my line.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.699
"Looks like someone committed

07:11.699 --> 07:13.701
a boo-glary."

07:13.701 --> 07:16.737
(laughter and applause)

07:16.737 --> 07:18.205
I was a hit.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.640
I knew then that I wanted to

07:19.640 --> 07:20.974
solve crimes and tell crime-

07:20.974 --> 07:22.409
related puns for the rest of

07:22.409 --> 07:23.544
my life.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.878
And then in the doorway

07:24.878 --> 07:26.580
I saw my estranged father.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.048
He had finally come to watch me

07:28.048 --> 07:29.382
perform.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.720
Dad never understood my love

07:32.720 --> 07:34.555
of wordplay...

07:34.555 --> 07:36.256
until that moment.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.390
Very touching.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.492
Too bad it's not remotely

07:38.492 --> 07:39.159
what happened.

07:39.159 --> 07:39.893
What?

07:39.893 --> 07:41.061
First of all, you weren't

07:41.061 --> 07:42.029
wearing sunglasses.

07:42.029 --> 07:42.863
You were dressed like

07:42.863 --> 07:43.664
a regular kid.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.699
And your actual line was:

07:45.699 --> 07:47.467
Look, a ghost!

07:50.571 --> 07:51.905
But why do I remember it

07:51.905 --> 07:52.840
that way?

07:52.840 --> 07:53.741
Well, every time you told

07:53.741 --> 07:55.709
the story you added a detail

07:55.709 --> 07:57.244
and subconsciously tailored your

07:57.244 --> 07:58.946
memory to fit your audience,

07:58.946 --> 07:59.913
whether you were trying to

07:59.913 --> 08:00.681
impress them...

08:00.681 --> 08:02.449
No one had ever heard a kid

08:02.449 --> 08:05.452
be so funny... or spooky.

08:05.452 --> 08:06.386
...make them laugh...

08:06.386 --> 08:07.254
"Boo-glary."

08:07.254 --> 08:08.388
(laughter)

08:08.388 --> 08:09.923
Hey, you might say it was

08:09.923 --> 08:11.391
a polterg-heist.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.761
(laughter)

08:13.761 --> 08:15.696
Cheers.

08:15.696 --> 08:16.564
...or just because they

08:16.564 --> 08:17.731
ask you to as part of their

08:17.731 --> 08:19.066
basic cable show.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.534
I remember it like it was

08:20.534 --> 08:24.104
yesterday: the school play.

08:24.104 --> 08:24.772
(pop)

08:24.772 --> 08:26.106
And over time, the memory

08:26.106 --> 08:28.075
itself changed not because you

08:28.075 --> 08:29.577
were lying but because that's

08:29.577 --> 08:30.744
just what brains do.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.445
They add details to fill in

08:32.445 --> 08:33.213
the gaps.

08:33.213 --> 08:34.948
But my mean dad arriving at

08:34.948 --> 08:35.749
the last minute.

08:35.749 --> 08:36.784
Oh, you're just remembering

08:36.784 --> 08:37.450
the end of the movie

08:37.450 --> 08:38.819
"Billy Elliot": your dad was

08:38.819 --> 08:40.087
there, he recorded that.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.889
He was actually very supportive.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.725
Oh, my personal narrative!

08:44.725 --> 08:45.559
What do you think you are,

08:45.559 --> 08:46.760
a psychologist?

08:46.760 --> 08:49.730
No, but I am and he is right.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.264
Oh, guys, this is Elizabeth

08:51.264 --> 08:52.933
Loftus; she's a professor at

08:52.966 --> 08:54.635
UC Irvine and a pioneering

08:54.635 --> 08:55.736
researcher in the field of

08:55.769 --> 08:56.804
false memories.

08:56.804 --> 08:57.905
Oh, Elizabeth, tell them how

08:57.905 --> 08:59.239
easy it is to influence memory.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.507
It is so cool.

09:00.507 --> 09:01.474
Sure, Adam.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.644
I conducted a study where we

09:03.644 --> 09:05.412
showed people simulated car

09:05.412 --> 09:07.447
accidents, and even though these

09:07.447 --> 09:09.449
were minor accidents we could

09:09.449 --> 09:11.685
ask leading questions and get

09:11.685 --> 09:13.153
people to remember that the cars

09:13.153 --> 09:15.355
were going faster and to

09:15.355 --> 09:16.990
"remember" that they saw

09:16.990 --> 09:18.659
broken glass at the scene,

09:18.659 --> 09:19.760
even though there wasn't any

09:19.760 --> 09:21.328
broken glass at all.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.763
And we really need to keep

09:22.763 --> 09:24.665
in mind that when people recall

09:24.665 --> 09:26.266
something, they can have a lot

09:26.266 --> 09:28.335
of detail, a lot of confidence,

09:28.335 --> 09:30.137
a lot of emotion when they tell

09:30.137 --> 09:32.039
you a story, even though

09:32.039 --> 09:33.206
it never happened.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.608
That's insane!

09:34.608 --> 09:36.009
How could our brains get it

09:36.009 --> 09:36.944
wrong so quickly?

09:36.944 --> 09:38.111
It's because our memories

09:38.111 --> 09:39.880
just don't work like the cameras

09:39.880 --> 09:40.981
recording this TV show.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.449
That's right; they work more

09:42.449 --> 09:44.484
like a Wikipedia page, which

09:44.484 --> 09:45.786
means you can go in there and

09:45.786 --> 09:48.388
edit it but so can other people,

09:48.388 --> 09:50.157
and this has real consequences

09:50.157 --> 09:51.659
for law enforcement because

09:51.659 --> 09:53.794
sometimes police maybe

09:53.794 --> 09:55.896
inadvertently will ask leading

09:55.896 --> 09:57.297
or suggestive questions

09:57.297 --> 09:58.699
and they can contaminate

09:58.699 --> 10:00.200
the memories of the witnesses

10:00.200 --> 10:01.368
they're interviewing.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.936
Here, I'll show you.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.577
Ma'am?

10:10.577 --> 10:11.912
You have to pay.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.214
I did already, remember?

10:14.214 --> 10:15.515
Oh, yeah.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.853
Wait a second!

10:19.853 --> 10:21.088
Line up, please.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.389
(door lock buzzing)

10:22.389 --> 10:23.556
Even when they don't do it

10:23.556 --> 10:25.693
intentionally cops unconsciously

10:25.693 --> 10:27.394
bias and alter the memories

10:27.394 --> 10:29.329
of witnesses all the time.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.263
Which one of these guys

10:30.263 --> 10:31.064
stole your purse?

10:31.064 --> 10:32.532
I think it was...

10:32.532 --> 10:35.535
(scoffs) Oh.

10:35.535 --> 10:36.403
Oh!

10:36.403 --> 10:37.404
Him, the guy with

10:37.404 --> 10:38.238
the eye patch.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.272
You sure?

10:39.272 --> 10:40.841
Yes, I remember him.

10:40.841 --> 10:41.675
No, that's not a criminal,

10:41.675 --> 10:42.843
that's just my friend Larry.

10:42.843 --> 10:43.944
He just looks scary 'cause of

10:43.944 --> 10:45.245
his scratched cornea.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.914
Hey, Larry, how's your eye?

10:46.914 --> 10:48.048
It's not great, man.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.349
The doctor told me to come back

10:49.349 --> 10:50.784
in two weeks and I don't have

10:50.784 --> 10:51.618
enough drugs.

10:51.618 --> 10:52.853
I don't have an HMO.

10:52.853 --> 10:53.754
You know, it's very--

10:53.754 --> 10:55.388
God, this guy could talk!

10:55.388 --> 10:56.890
But eyewitness testimony is

10:56.890 --> 10:58.258
the foundation of police work.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.027
Yeah, that's why it sucks

11:00.027 --> 11:01.428
that when it comes to the truth,

11:01.428 --> 11:03.530
our memories simply can't be

11:03.530 --> 11:05.598
trusted.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.434
(grunting)

11:07.434 --> 11:08.101
(cell phone ringtone)

11:08.101 --> 11:09.770
It's the forensics lab.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.538
Looks like they found Conover's

11:11.538 --> 11:13.273
fingerprints at the scene.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.307
And no two fingerprints

11:14.307 --> 11:15.308
are alike.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.710
Why don't you grab your crown

11:16.710 --> 11:18.211
'cause it looks like we got you,

11:18.211 --> 11:21.281
"Prints" Charming?

11:21.281 --> 11:22.049
What, I can't do one?

11:22.049 --> 11:23.150
Actually, that's never been

11:23.150 --> 11:24.484
proven; the fingerprints thing's

11:24.484 --> 11:25.753
not a real fact. (chuckling)

11:25.753 --> 11:26.820
I'm gonna kill you.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.588
I'm gonna kill you!

11:42.602 --> 11:44.071
Work your magic, Macy.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.305
Just have to enhance...

11:45.305 --> 11:46.974
(beeping)

11:46.974 --> 11:48.341
...and enhance...

11:48.341 --> 11:49.509
(beeping)

11:49.509 --> 11:50.811
Enhance... ooh!

11:50.811 --> 11:52.012
Too enhanced.

11:52.012 --> 11:52.980
Dehance.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.115
(beeping)

11:57.851 --> 11:58.819
The print matches.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.253
It couldn't possibly be

12:00.253 --> 12:01.188
anyone else.

12:01.188 --> 12:01.989
First of all...

12:01.989 --> 12:02.823
(all gasping)

12:02.823 --> 12:04.157
..."enhance" isn't a thing.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.292
Digital photos have a limited

12:05.292 --> 12:06.493
resolution; you can't just yell

12:06.493 --> 12:07.527
at a computer to get more

12:07.527 --> 12:09.496
detail, and secondly there is

12:09.496 --> 12:11.364
no scientific proof that

12:11.364 --> 12:12.499
fingerprints are unique.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.666
Enough, Conover!

12:13.666 --> 12:15.268
Everyone knows no two

12:15.268 --> 12:16.669
fingerprints are alike.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.205
Like snowflakes.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.139
Oh! Funny you should say

12:19.139 --> 12:20.007
that.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.641
In the 1980s a researcher

12:21.641 --> 12:23.476
actually found two snowflakes

12:23.476 --> 12:24.878
that had precisely the same

12:24.878 --> 12:25.678
pattern--

12:25.678 --> 12:26.346
Hey, Dingledork, let's keep

12:26.346 --> 12:27.514
it to fingerprints, okay?

12:27.514 --> 12:28.481
Of course, save that for

12:28.481 --> 12:29.682
the Christmas episode.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.484
The "no two fingerprints are

12:31.484 --> 12:33.453
alike" cliché isn't science.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.055
It's just something one guy said

12:35.055 --> 12:36.623
in 1892.

12:36.623 --> 12:37.791
My name is Sir Francis

12:37.791 --> 12:39.459
Galton; I postulate the chances

12:39.459 --> 12:40.961
of two specific individuals

12:40.961 --> 12:42.195
having the same fingerprint

12:42.195 --> 12:44.231
is very teeny-tiny.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.365
Well, he sounds very

12:45.365 --> 12:46.166
respectable.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.367
I also invented eugenics.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.169
Oh, God, get him out of here!

12:49.169 --> 12:51.038
Today Galton's hunch is

12:51.038 --> 12:52.639
common wisdom, and everyone

12:52.639 --> 12:53.841
assumes that fingerprint

12:53.841 --> 12:55.142
evidence is infallible,

12:55.142 --> 12:56.543
but it's not.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.410
Take the case of Brandon

12:57.410 --> 12:58.846
Mayfield: he was arrested for

12:58.846 --> 13:00.247
the Madrid train bombings after

13:00.247 --> 13:01.314
the world's top fingerprint

13:01.314 --> 13:02.916
experts swore that he was a

13:02.916 --> 13:04.384
perfect match for a print found

13:04.384 --> 13:05.385
at the scene.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.220
But it wasn't me.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.156
I'm an attorney from Oregon.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.523
I've never even been to Spain.

13:10.523 --> 13:11.524
Oh, you should go,

13:11.524 --> 13:12.392
it's lovely.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.326
But because they believed

13:13.326 --> 13:15.062
that fingerprints told no lies,

13:15.062 --> 13:16.763
the FBI arrested Mayfield

13:16.763 --> 13:18.498
and held him for weeks.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.666
By the way, I'm not the real

13:19.666 --> 13:20.333
Brandon.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.035
I'm an actor.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.503
Hey! Let me out of here--

13:23.503 --> 13:24.337
And even after making this

13:24.337 --> 13:26.039
mistake, federal agents still

13:26.039 --> 13:27.407
maintained that fingerprint

13:27.407 --> 13:28.909
evidence was "infallible."

13:28.909 --> 13:30.710
Of course they're infallible.

13:30.710 --> 13:31.845
We have all these fancy

13:31.845 --> 13:32.512
computers.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.781
Sure, on TV you do.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.116
But in real life, it looks more

13:36.116 --> 13:37.384
like this.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.685
Here's how a real fingerprint

13:38.685 --> 13:41.254
analyst works.

13:41.254 --> 13:41.922
Wait a minute, those

13:41.922 --> 13:43.756
fingerprints look all smudgy.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.392
Man, is she just eyeballing it?

13:45.392 --> 13:46.259
That's insane!

13:46.259 --> 13:47.594
Yeah, fingerprints pulled

13:47.594 --> 13:49.096
from crime scenes tend to be

13:49.096 --> 13:49.930
incomplete.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.264
And the final stage of matching

13:51.264 --> 13:52.933
isn't done by computers, it's

13:52.933 --> 13:54.201
done by humans.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.802
That means there's a huge

13:55.802 --> 13:57.804
potential for error and bias.

13:57.804 --> 13:58.939
It's been shown that analysts

13:58.939 --> 14:00.373
can unconsciously change their

14:00.373 --> 14:01.808
evaluations depending on the

14:01.808 --> 14:03.110
details of a case.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.644
Watch this.

14:04.644 --> 14:05.545
Do these fingerprints match

14:05.545 --> 14:06.279
the robber's?

14:06.279 --> 14:07.447
No, not a match.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.082
And do these fingerprints

14:09.082 --> 14:11.584
match the cat murderer's?

14:11.584 --> 14:13.553
Yes! It's a perfect match!

14:13.553 --> 14:15.488
Catch that fiend!

14:15.488 --> 14:16.924
Wait, I thought fingerprint

14:16.924 --> 14:18.758
matching was scientifically

14:18.758 --> 14:19.426
proven.

14:19.426 --> 14:20.593
Actually, Detective,

14:20.627 --> 14:21.628
it's not.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.296
Let me guess, another punk

14:23.296 --> 14:24.097
expert?

14:24.097 --> 14:25.465
Yep! This is Simon Cole,

14:25.498 --> 14:27.300
a criminologist at UC Irvine

14:27.300 --> 14:28.301
who studies fingerprint

14:28.301 --> 14:29.169
analysis.

14:29.169 --> 14:29.836
You know, fingerprint

14:29.836 --> 14:31.138
evidence has been used in court

14:31.138 --> 14:32.672
for over a century now, and

14:32.672 --> 14:34.007
until recently, almost no

14:34.007 --> 14:35.408
research was done into how

14:35.408 --> 14:36.643
reliable it is.

14:36.643 --> 14:37.777
Really?

14:37.777 --> 14:38.979
Are you (bleep)ing with me?

14:38.979 --> 14:39.980
Is this guy (bleep)ing with me?

14:39.980 --> 14:41.314
Unfortunately not.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.515
And the Supreme Court ruled in

14:42.515 --> 14:43.984
the Daubert decision that

14:43.984 --> 14:45.152
scientific evidence used in

14:45.152 --> 14:47.087
court has to be reliable.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.588
According to that decision,

14:48.588 --> 14:49.856
unless fingerprint evidence is

14:49.856 --> 14:51.158
offered with a substantial

14:51.158 --> 14:52.625
proviso, it shouldn't even be

14:52.625 --> 14:54.627
allowed in court.

14:54.627 --> 14:55.695
(sighs) You are the worst

14:55.695 --> 14:57.030
criminal we've ever had on this

14:57.030 --> 14:58.031
show.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.632
Exactly!

14:59.632 --> 15:01.301
Cop shows like yours present

15:01.301 --> 15:03.170
forensic science as infallible,

15:03.170 --> 15:04.771
but in reality, a lot of it

15:04.771 --> 15:06.873
isn't scientific at all.

15:06.873 --> 15:09.009
The FBI recently admitted that

15:09.009 --> 15:10.043
when conducting hair strand

15:10.043 --> 15:11.945
matches, their "experts" gave

15:11.945 --> 15:14.614
flawed testimony in 90% of the

15:14.614 --> 15:15.983
cases they reviewed.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.684
And in death penalty cases, the

15:17.684 --> 15:20.020
number was 94%, including one

15:20.020 --> 15:21.388
time that a hair strand matched

15:21.388 --> 15:23.023
to a human turned out to be

15:23.023 --> 15:24.024
dog hair.

15:24.024 --> 15:27.995
(dramatic music)

15:27.995 --> 15:29.997
Bite mark analysis is notorious

15:29.997 --> 15:31.331
nonsense, promulgated by a

15:31.331 --> 15:32.699
small, ungoverned group of

15:32.699 --> 15:33.566
dentists.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.168
Two men were once sent to death

15:35.168 --> 15:36.669
row because of bite marks that

15:36.669 --> 15:38.738
were likely made by crawfish.

15:38.738 --> 15:41.674
(dramatic music)

15:41.674 --> 15:42.542
And, you've heard how fire

15:42.542 --> 15:44.877
investigators "detect" arson by

15:44.877 --> 15:46.413
searching for "pouring

15:46.413 --> 15:47.214
patterns."

15:47.214 --> 15:48.415
These pouring patterns

15:48.415 --> 15:49.682
suggest gasoline.

15:49.682 --> 15:50.917
Scientists have since shown

15:50.917 --> 15:52.019
that those patterns happen in

15:52.019 --> 15:53.653
any fire that has a flashover

15:53.653 --> 15:54.387
event.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.888
Eyeballing crime scenes just

15:55.888 --> 15:57.224
isn't scientific.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.725
Huh... this one looks like

15:58.725 --> 15:59.659
a bunny!

15:59.659 --> 16:01.061
(squealing, smacking lips)

16:01.061 --> 16:03.530
(dramatic music)

16:03.530 --> 16:07.500
This city is full of animals.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.735
Listen, "grundel chum," what

16:08.735 --> 16:09.736
are we supposed to do?

16:09.736 --> 16:10.503
We're trying to get criminals

16:10.503 --> 16:11.404
off the streets here.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.572
Yeah, that's exactly the

16:12.572 --> 16:13.240
problem.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.607
These techniques are great at

16:14.607 --> 16:16.009
locking people up, but they're

16:16.009 --> 16:17.577
terrible at figuring out what

16:17.577 --> 16:19.079
actually happened.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.080
And that means they often get

16:20.080 --> 16:22.049
the wrong person sent to prison,

16:22.049 --> 16:23.750
or even executed.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.519
Bad forensic sciences ruin lives

16:26.519 --> 16:28.755
and kill people.

16:28.755 --> 16:29.789
Damn it!

16:29.789 --> 16:31.558
You're right, again!

16:31.558 --> 16:35.862
Again!

16:35.862 --> 16:37.430
Wow, you must really hate

16:37.430 --> 16:38.598
coffee.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.433
I love it.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.369
I'm messed up, man.

16:46.706 --> 16:47.807
Face it, Cormac.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.442
All of our CSI techniques are

16:49.442 --> 16:50.977
nonsense.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.079
And, we have no evidence against

16:52.079 --> 16:53.380
this guy, and the real murderer

16:53.380 --> 16:55.282
is still out there.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.116
(sniffs)

16:56.116 --> 16:57.317
Guess you don't have to pay for

16:57.317 --> 17:00.253
takeout, Adam.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.789
Because you're free to go.

17:02.789 --> 17:03.723
Finally. (chuckles)

17:03.723 --> 17:05.092
Well, off to rewrite the plaques

17:05.092 --> 17:06.593
at the Natural History Museum.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.595
Unless... you could tell us

17:08.595 --> 17:10.097
about a forensic science that

17:10.097 --> 17:12.732
does work.

17:12.732 --> 17:17.270
(sighs)

17:17.270 --> 17:20.140
Of course I can.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.109
Nailed him.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.518
News 8 is live at the crime

17:31.518 --> 17:33.120
scene, where accused murderer

17:33.120 --> 17:34.254
and irritating know-it-all

17:34.254 --> 17:35.288
Adam Conover delivers a

17:35.288 --> 17:36.256
statement.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.657
Let's all do our best to listen

17:37.657 --> 17:38.691
to the whole thing.

17:38.691 --> 17:39.626
Over the course of this

17:39.626 --> 17:40.960
episode, I have made a

17:40.960 --> 17:42.795
compelling case against flawed

17:42.795 --> 17:43.763
forensic science.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.665
But, what do I know?

17:45.665 --> 17:47.300
I am just a simple, southern

17:47.300 --> 17:48.368
lawyer. (chuckles)

17:48.368 --> 17:49.769
Objection. You are clearly

17:49.769 --> 17:50.503
from Long Island.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.838
And, we're not in court.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.473
And, you're not a lawyer.

17:53.473 --> 17:54.807
Ah, no, but I know someone

17:54.807 --> 17:55.475
who is.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.310
Please welcome my legal counsel,

17:57.310 --> 17:59.512
Chris Fabricant.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.513
Chris is a lawyer with the

18:00.513 --> 18:01.614
Innocence Project, an

18:01.648 --> 18:03.150
organization that works to free

18:03.150 --> 18:04.651
the wrongfully convicted.

18:04.651 --> 18:05.718
Detective, there is a method

18:05.718 --> 18:07.019
of forensic investigation that

18:07.019 --> 18:08.020
is scientific.

18:08.054 --> 18:10.690
And, it's this-- (sneezes)

18:10.690 --> 18:12.659
Oh.

18:12.659 --> 18:13.460
It's DNA.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.461
Get it?

18:14.461 --> 18:15.362
The Innocence Project has

18:15.362 --> 18:17.864
used DNA evidence to free 330

18:17.864 --> 18:19.031
wrongfully convicted people.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.467
And about half of those people

18:20.467 --> 18:22.569
were put there by old, outdated

18:22.569 --> 18:23.570
forensic techniques.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.173
Well, isn't DNA evidence just

18:26.173 --> 18:27.674
more forensic science?

18:27.674 --> 18:28.641
It is, and it isn't

18:28.641 --> 18:30.377
infallible, but DNA evidence

18:30.377 --> 18:31.344
was actually developed in a

18:31.344 --> 18:32.879
laboratory by scientists, rather

18:32.879 --> 18:34.347
than police officers in lab

18:34.347 --> 18:35.215
coats pretending to be

18:35.215 --> 18:36.015
scientists.

18:36.015 --> 18:37.184
Real research was done before it

18:37.184 --> 18:38.251
was introduced into criminal

18:38.251 --> 18:39.186
trials.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.253
The Innocence Project had a

18:40.253 --> 18:42.489
client named Ray Krone who was

18:42.489 --> 18:44.324
a regular at a bar in Tucson,

18:44.324 --> 18:46.526
Arizona, and the bartender where

18:46.526 --> 18:47.860
he used to drink was murdered

18:47.860 --> 18:48.861
one night.

18:48.861 --> 18:49.929
They had no suspects, no

18:49.929 --> 18:52.098
witnesses, and they used bite

18:52.098 --> 18:54.201
mark analysis to associate him

18:54.201 --> 18:55.202
with that dead body.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.203
And that was the only evidence

18:56.203 --> 18:57.103
that connected him to that

18:57.103 --> 18:58.037
crime.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.706
He spent 10 years on death row

18:59.739 --> 19:01.408
before DNA evidence exonerated

19:01.408 --> 19:04.110
him.

19:04.110 --> 19:04.977
If we want to continue to just

19:05.011 --> 19:06.379
throw everybody in prison, then

19:06.379 --> 19:07.079
the old techniques will work

19:07.079 --> 19:07.747
just fine.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.081
If we want to catch the actual

19:09.081 --> 19:10.217
perpetrator, we need to stop

19:10.217 --> 19:11.584
using outdated techniques.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.719
And start using ones that

19:12.719 --> 19:13.953
have been proven to, uh, you

19:13.953 --> 19:15.588
know, work.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.625
(groaning)

19:18.625 --> 19:21.127
That's just-- actually, quite

19:21.127 --> 19:22.128
reasonable.

19:22.128 --> 19:23.363
I'm convinced.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.564
Oh. These are the moments

19:24.564 --> 19:26.098
I live for-- people reluctantly

19:26.098 --> 19:27.567
agreeing with me. (chuckles)

19:27.567 --> 19:28.801
So, if you're innocent, who

19:28.801 --> 19:29.469
did it?

19:29.469 --> 19:30.237
Yeah, who did it?

19:30.237 --> 19:30.903
(reporters muttering)

19:30.903 --> 19:32.071
Yeah, who did it?

19:32.071 --> 19:33.306
Oh, no one did it.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.407
The dead body was just my

19:34.407 --> 19:35.308
producer, John.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.309
Oh, there he is as the

19:36.309 --> 19:37.109
cameraman.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.811
Hi, John!

19:38.811 --> 19:39.946
(camera clicking)

19:39.946 --> 19:41.581
Wait a second.

19:41.581 --> 19:42.449
(echoing) Our memories just

19:42.449 --> 19:43.916
don't work like the cameras

19:43.916 --> 19:45.252
recording this TV show.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.586
Over the course of this episode,

19:46.586 --> 19:48.621
I have made a compelling case...

19:48.621 --> 19:49.756
Are you happy now?

19:49.756 --> 19:50.890
Yeah, I am, 'cause now

19:50.890 --> 19:52.225
everyone knows that, so you

19:52.225 --> 19:53.560
can't trick 'em anymore.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.161
Cop shows like yours present

19:55.161 --> 19:56.796
forensic science as infallible.

19:56.796 --> 19:57.664
Hey, how are you doing that?

19:57.664 --> 19:58.831
By the way, I'm not the real

19:58.831 --> 19:59.499
Brandon.

19:59.499 --> 20:00.467
I'm an actor.

20:00.467 --> 20:01.268
Stop it!

20:01.268 --> 20:02.402
It's a lie!

20:02.402 --> 20:05.305
It's a lie!

20:05.305 --> 20:06.573
Of course!

20:06.573 --> 20:08.441
You faked this entire murder

20:08.441 --> 20:09.642
just to film your TV show,

20:09.642 --> 20:10.310
didn't you?

20:10.310 --> 20:11.778
Ha, guilty as charged.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.112
But I only did it to inform all

20:13.112 --> 20:14.080
of you about this important

20:14.080 --> 20:14.814
issue.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.683
You know, hey, if using police

20:16.683 --> 20:18.685
resources to educate people is

20:18.685 --> 20:21.020
a crime, well, lock me up.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.455
(chuckles)

20:22.455 --> 20:23.122
(door clangs)

20:23.122 --> 20:24.123
Huh.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.759
(grunting)

20:28.961 --> 20:31.664
(distant siren wailing)

20:31.698 --> 20:32.799
Here's a fun fact.

20:32.799 --> 20:33.466
Did you know that in

20:33.466 --> 20:35.134
Scandinavia, they actually have

20:35.134 --> 20:36.803
open air prisons.

20:36.803 --> 20:37.470
(grunting)

20:37.470 --> 20:38.137
Yeah, they're quite

20:38.137 --> 20:38.971
successful.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.106
Think about it, if we were in

20:40.106 --> 20:41.841
Finland, we could be outside

20:41.841 --> 20:44.210
right now. (chuckles)

20:44.210 --> 20:45.645
(grunting)

20:45.645 --> 20:48.315
You know... this is actually

20:48.315 --> 20:49.982
much nicer than where I live.

20:49.982 --> 20:50.650
(chuckles)

20:50.650 --> 20:52.852
(grunting)

20:52.852 --> 20:54.854
Buddy, we were talking.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.489
You tell me a fact!

20:56.523 --> 20:57.189
Next time, on

20:57.189 --> 20:58.358
"Adam Ruins Everything"...

20:58.358 --> 20:59.992
It's restaurants, isn't it?

20:59.992 --> 21:01.328
Tipping is a custom we'd be

21:01.328 --> 21:02.695
better off without.

21:02.695 --> 21:03.663
I never!

21:03.663 --> 21:06.299
59% wasn't tuna at all.
