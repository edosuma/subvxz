07:14.033 --> 07:17.000
foxtrot 31 delta...

07:17.067 --> 07:20.501
Tango one romeo headed
for your 20, over.

07:20.567 --> 07:24.133
zero alpha, copy,
bring it on, out.

07:48.767 --> 07:50.734
Dr. Lightman?

07:50.801 --> 07:52.734
This way, doc.

07:52.801 --> 07:55.934
"doc." I like that.
I do, you know? I do.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.367
Right this way.

07:58.434 --> 08:01.100
Watch your head here.

08:06.467 --> 08:07.901
Festive.

08:07.968 --> 08:09.734
Yeah, the more I make,
the better they get.

08:09.801 --> 08:11.734
Welcome to the north pole,
Dr. lightman.

08:11.801 --> 08:13.167
John parks, team commander.

08:13.234 --> 08:14.567
How do you do?

08:14.634 --> 08:16.968
Look, straight away,
I see you're wondering
what idiot came up

08:17.033 --> 08:19.300
With the plan
to send me over here.

08:19.367 --> 08:20.801
So, we have something
in common.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.434
Charlie team
at altitude,

08:22.501 --> 08:24.033
Waiting for your
go-order, boss.

08:24.100 --> 08:27.033
Right now, all you
and I care about are my
12 soldiers in the air,

08:27.100 --> 08:29.534
Ready to halo into
the Taliban compound
our new friend here says

08:29.601 --> 08:32.067
Are holding
those two marines.

08:32.133 --> 08:34.067
Wait. I mean,
you already sent
the mission over

08:34.133 --> 08:36.868
Before I even had
a chance to talk
to you?

08:36.933 --> 08:38.868
I moved my team
within striking distance.

08:38.933 --> 08:40.433
I do my job,
you do yours.

08:40.501 --> 08:42.167
Final decision's mine,
period.

08:42.234 --> 08:44.601
No disrespect,
but we don't have
a lot of time

08:44.667 --> 08:46.968
To screw around
before these animals
start cutting heads off.

08:47.033 --> 08:48.367
All right, well,
do me a favor, will you?

08:48.434 --> 08:50.968
Just hold on
the go-order, you know,
till I've had a chance

08:51.033 --> 08:52.467
To talk to your
new friend here.

08:52.534 --> 08:54.801
Yeah, I'll do my best not
to screw around, all right?

08:54.868 --> 08:57.767
We gave him a shave,
cleaned him up.

08:57.834 --> 09:00.501
Sat-link eyes
to your people.

09:07.467 --> 09:09.767
Do you believe
in Santa Claus?

09:11.534 --> 09:13.200
Up.

09:18.033 --> 09:19.667
Cheers.

09:23.534 --> 09:27.100
Say hello to
the folks back home.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.934
I'm serious.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.801
Say hello to the folks
back home.

09:33.868 --> 09:35.501
Hello.

09:35.567 --> 09:37.000
Whoa. he felt that.

09:37.067 --> 09:39.834
Deep sadness at
the mention of home.

09:39.901 --> 09:42.534
what are they?
paper snowflakes?

09:42.601 --> 09:45.934
when Lightman asked him
if he believed in Santa Claus,
I saw a flash of hope.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.501
Where's home for you,
Franko?

09:49.567 --> 09:50.934
What?

09:51.000 --> 09:52.767
Where's home for you,
Franko?

09:52.834 --> 09:55.367
1276 bay view,
Baltimore, Maryland.

09:55.434 --> 09:58.033
blurts out
a street address, like he
memorized it by heart.

09:58.100 --> 09:59.534
I--I lived
with my aunt.

09:59.601 --> 10:00.968
Aunt Wendy.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.567
I'm sorry?

10:02.634 --> 10:05.367
Wendy Perriman.
my aunt.

10:05.434 --> 10:07.300
Is that supposed to mean
something to me or--

10:07.367 --> 10:09.400
My aunt.

10:09.467 --> 10:11.901
Bay view what?

10:11.968 --> 10:14.400
Bay view avenue?

10:14.467 --> 10:17.400
Bay view... terrace?
boulevard?

10:17.467 --> 10:19.267
Street? what is it?
avenue.

10:19.334 --> 10:21.734
'cause you seemed,
you know, pretty sure
about every other detail,

10:21.801 --> 10:24.234
Except for that
one small thing.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.801
Bay view road, Baltimore.

10:26.868 --> 10:29.234
And the natives
pronounce it "ballmer."

10:29.300 --> 10:31.801
You know, I'm not
buying much, if any,

10:31.868 --> 10:33.567
Of the whole aid worker,

10:33.634 --> 10:35.100
Aunt Wendy story.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.033
I mean, why lie about
your aunt Wendy

10:37.100 --> 10:39.100
Unless she's part
of some cover-up,

10:39.167 --> 10:41.334
Some--what is it?

10:41.400 --> 10:43.067
CIA?

10:44.267 --> 10:46.734
Oh, that struck a nerve.

10:46.801 --> 10:48.834
All right. moving on.

10:48.901 --> 10:52.434
How do you know where
the Taliban are holding
these two marines?

10:52.501 --> 10:54.467
Why give up
that information?

10:54.534 --> 10:57.234
Because
I'm an American,
not like you.

10:57.300 --> 10:58.834
Ex-CIA,

10:58.901 --> 11:01.701
Rogue lunatic--
I mean, whatever it is,
any idiot can see

11:01.767 --> 11:05.334
That you've--you've
grown some deep...

11:05.400 --> 11:08.133
Hatred of all things
uncle Sam.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.234
You know what I think?
I think you're just...

11:11.300 --> 11:13.234
A traitor...

11:13.300 --> 11:15.801
Trying to save
his own skin.

11:17.901 --> 11:20.467
What's your
Taliban name, Franko?

11:22.601 --> 11:25.534
This close to the border
with Pakistan,

11:25.601 --> 11:27.534
The Taliban never moves
more than ten miles

11:27.601 --> 11:30.033
With prisoners
in the first 48 hours,

11:30.100 --> 11:31.534
And only at night.

11:31.601 --> 11:33.601
The place I told
these soldiers about

11:33.667 --> 11:35.100
Is the safest place
to hide

11:35.167 --> 11:37.267
That close to where
the marines were
captured.

11:37.334 --> 11:39.701
He said the first
half of that with
extreme confidence

11:39.767 --> 11:41.300
Because it's
probably true.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.000
But he used
the word "safest,"

11:43.067 --> 11:44.901
Inferring that the
Taliban have more

11:44.968 --> 11:46.334
Than one place
they hide out.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.734
Where else might
the Taliban be hiding?

11:48.801 --> 11:50.234
Nowhere.

11:50.300 --> 11:52.400
Oh, well, your shoulder
begs to differ.

11:52.467 --> 11:55.100
all call signs,
stand by for go.

12:00.834 --> 12:03.167
He's lying.

12:03.234 --> 12:05.400
Yeah, he's sending you
to the wrong location.

12:05.467 --> 12:07.467
He's... lying.

12:07.534 --> 12:09.434
Charlie one,
over target area now.

12:09.501 --> 12:11.467
You're sure he's lying?
yeah.

12:11.534 --> 12:14.100
No. well, 70%.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.601
Yeah, at best,
he's sending you to
an empty compound;

12:16.667 --> 12:19.367
At worst, it's
an ambush, right?
sit down.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.801
70%?
it's not an exact science.

12:21.868 --> 12:24.734
If it was, you'd have
bin laden by now,
wouldn't you, huh?

12:28.434 --> 12:30.200
Abort.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.000
Do it, Mo. now.

12:33.067 --> 12:35.834
Abort. say again,
abort the mission.

12:35.901 --> 12:38.534
You better be right,
Dr. Lightman.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.467
Yeah.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.101
forget it.
no way in hell.

12:49.167 --> 12:51.667
Look, I get that
you're a scientist,

12:51.734 --> 12:53.600
But this is no place
for experiments.

12:53.667 --> 12:56.633
Look, this guy,
he's definitely
hiding something.

12:56.700 --> 12:58.101
Whatever it is,
it's buried it deep.

12:58.167 --> 13:00.101
And there's a connection
to your government
somewhere.

13:00.167 --> 13:01.800
I'm telling you,
you gotta let me

13:01.867 --> 13:03.301
Dig it out of him.

13:03.368 --> 13:05.034
You mean to tell me
this maggot's some
sort of spy for us?

13:05.101 --> 13:07.267
Yeah. CIA, or related.

13:07.334 --> 13:09.600
And either
he's protecting

13:09.667 --> 13:11.368
Some long-term
deep cover operation,

13:11.434 --> 13:12.867
Or he's just been
out here too long

13:12.934 --> 13:14.900
And he's flipped
to the other side.

13:14.967 --> 13:16.500
Those are just
theories, doc.

13:16.567 --> 13:17.967
Look, you already
proved smarter
than that

13:18.034 --> 13:19.267
When you axed plan "a."

13:19.334 --> 13:21.101
Don't give up
on me now, pal,

13:21.167 --> 13:22.468
Or I'm on
the first donkey
out of here, all right?

13:22.533 --> 13:24.201
Whatever he is,
whoever he is,

13:24.267 --> 13:25.700
I don't care.

13:25.767 --> 13:27.034
I need accurate Intel
from him,

13:27.101 --> 13:28.134
And I need it yesterday.

13:28.201 --> 13:31.567
Yeah, yeah.
no, you're right.

13:31.633 --> 13:32.967
Sod the science.
give me a weapon.

13:33.034 --> 13:34.633
Well, at least
I'll get home in time

13:34.700 --> 13:36.234
For my daughter's
Christmas party.

13:36.301 --> 13:38.434
I'm serious.
weapon please.

13:41.533 --> 13:43.401
Mr. Komisky?

13:43.468 --> 13:45.567
Please. Ed.

13:45.633 --> 13:47.201
State department?
pentagon?

13:47.267 --> 13:48.633
Defence.

13:48.700 --> 13:50.734
Special deputy
operations and plans.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.934
I'll be observing
Dr. Lightman's progress
with the prisoner.

13:54.001 --> 13:57.567
Top secret news sure does
spread fast in this town.

13:57.633 --> 13:59.267
Ha ha!
welcome.

13:59.334 --> 14:01.267
Cute.
this way.

14:09.767 --> 14:11.001
Rah!

14:12.934 --> 14:16.034
All right.

14:16.101 --> 14:17.600
Well, he's ready
for battle,

14:17.667 --> 14:21.401
And he's smart enough
to know when to live
to fight another day.

14:21.468 --> 14:25.900
So he's a warrior.
he's not a martyr.

14:25.967 --> 14:27.734
These are 3 of the boys
you tried to lead

14:27.800 --> 14:29.434
To the wrong
Taliban compound.

14:29.500 --> 14:33.533
What was it? eh?

14:33.600 --> 14:36.434
Was it an ambush?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.434
Was it
an empty compound?

14:38.500 --> 14:39.533
Oh, empty compound.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.267
Well, that's something,
I suppose. eh, lads?

14:43.167 --> 14:44.500
Hey!

14:44.567 --> 14:46.067
We keep hearing
this story

14:46.134 --> 14:49.001
About you being a CIA
agent who got boned.

14:49.067 --> 14:50.434
That you got sent
out here years ago,

14:50.500 --> 14:53.267
Left for dead.
is that right?

14:53.334 --> 14:55.001
If I don't get home
to Texas, boy,

14:55.067 --> 14:56.900
My wife is gonna take
my daughter

14:56.967 --> 14:58.067
And move back
to Michigan.

14:58.134 --> 14:59.734
Look, this is
my last tour.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.234
After this, I'm done.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.267
Is it true you got
boned by the CIA?

15:03.334 --> 15:05.067
Still don't understand
what you did.

15:05.134 --> 15:06.401
What'd I do?

15:06.468 --> 15:09.034
You went over to the enemy,
you punk.

15:11.401 --> 15:13.468
Attempt at anger.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.800
No, wait, wait.

15:20.867 --> 15:23.134
Now, I get it.
I see your shame.

15:23.201 --> 15:24.633
I see it.

15:24.700 --> 15:27.633
All right, it was
either join them or die.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.900
I mean, these 3,
they might not do
what you did,

15:29.967 --> 15:31.500
But I might.

15:31.567 --> 15:32.967
I mean, I'm
a natural born
coward, me.

15:33.034 --> 15:35.001
My blood runs as yellow
as the next man's.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.234
Lightman just called him
a coward.

15:36.301 --> 15:39.401
How is this helping
get our marines back
exactly?

15:39.468 --> 15:40.468
Well, Lightman just
called him a coward

15:40.533 --> 15:42.201
Because he's about to
present him

15:42.267 --> 15:43.334
With an opportunity
for redemption.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.167
Watch.

15:45.234 --> 15:47.934
But what you've
got in common
with these guys

15:48.001 --> 15:50.101
Is that it's
all about living
to fight tomorrow,

15:50.167 --> 15:52.434
Right, in the hope
that someday soon

15:52.500 --> 15:54.900
You get to go home.

15:56.167 --> 16:00.700
If that's not
on the cards,

16:00.767 --> 16:05.500
Then all that remains
is the last fight
you fight.

16:05.567 --> 16:08.800
And then the question
becomes...

16:08.867 --> 16:11.034
Which side of the fight
are you on?

16:13.234 --> 16:14.201
He's thinking about it.

16:14.267 --> 16:17.468
Oh, god. I'm--crap.
I'm so sorry.

16:17.533 --> 16:20.034
Uh, here, let's--
quick, before it stains.

16:20.101 --> 16:22.934
There is another hideout
in the area.

16:23.001 --> 16:24.934
But first, I have...

16:25.001 --> 16:26.301
First you have what?

16:26.368 --> 16:27.934
A condition.

16:28.001 --> 16:29.368
It's a very common
power play

16:29.434 --> 16:31.001
For someone who feels
backed into a corner

16:31.067 --> 16:33.500
With nothing
to lose or gain.

16:33.567 --> 16:36.201
You have a what?
what do you got?

16:36.267 --> 16:39.034
Every time you ask me
a question,

16:39.101 --> 16:40.900
I get to ask you
a question.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.700
The truth buys you
the truth.

16:42.767 --> 16:44.434
You lie, I lie.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.800
All right.

16:47.867 --> 16:50.401
But first, you
show me on the map

16:50.468 --> 16:52.600
Where the Taliban
are holding these
two marines.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.867
All right?

17:06.834 --> 17:12.101
Ok, here.
there's two caves

17:12.166 --> 17:14.666
With a tunnel
that connects them.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.800
It's been there
for over 200 years.

17:16.867 --> 17:20.034
Why didn't you
tell us about this
place to start with?

17:20.101 --> 17:23.267
No. he's been with
the Taliban too long.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.201
You're still
the bloody enemy.

17:25.267 --> 17:26.401
Me, on the other hand--

17:26.468 --> 17:28.734
I'm all that's
between you two.

17:31.101 --> 17:32.867
I'm really sorry
about this.

17:32.934 --> 17:34.201
I needed an excuse
to talk to you

17:34.267 --> 17:35.368
Away from Komisky.

17:35.434 --> 17:36.700
We need to figure out
some signals

17:36.767 --> 17:38.633
Or this is gonna get
expensive.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.201
Komisky's no stranger
to Franko.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.533
Yeah. you saw that, too?

17:41.600 --> 17:42.767
Another thing I saw--

17:42.834 --> 17:44.368
He's careful to keep himself
off the sat-link cameras,

17:44.434 --> 17:45.700
Hidden from Lightman
and Franko.

17:45.767 --> 17:49.134
Have you heard from my dad
in the last 24 hours?

17:49.201 --> 17:51.800
Yeah. yeah. why?

17:51.867 --> 17:54.468
Well, he always calls
to check in when he's
out of town,

17:54.533 --> 17:55.734
And he hasn't this time.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.468
His phone goes straight
to voice mail.

17:57.533 --> 17:59.533
Sweetheart, he's really
swamped right now,

17:59.600 --> 18:01.767
And he'll call
as soon as he can.

18:01.834 --> 18:03.734
Hey guys, we're minutes away
from...

18:03.800 --> 18:06.301
Hi, em,
how's the party coming?

18:06.368 --> 18:08.334
Well, what are they
minutes away from?

18:08.401 --> 18:09.767
Minutes away from what?

18:09.834 --> 18:11.834
He will be back
before you know it, ok?

18:11.900 --> 18:15.500
I gotta go, em, all right?
we'll talk later.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.067
Yeah, yeah. that's it.

18:24.134 --> 18:25.267
That's the cave.

18:25.334 --> 18:27.167
Bloody better be.

18:27.234 --> 18:28.500
Tell me.

18:28.567 --> 18:29.734
Am I ever gonna get home?

18:29.800 --> 18:31.700
We don't have time
for this game.

18:31.767 --> 18:34.334
It's not a game.
it's a test of trust.

18:34.401 --> 18:35.934
Right?

18:36.001 --> 18:36.967
Well, if you ever
do get home,

18:37.034 --> 18:38.700
You're pretty much
screwed.

18:38.767 --> 18:42.401
It's the right cave.
I'm 100% certain.

18:45.301 --> 18:47.900
Charlie one,
target confirmed.
move, move.

18:47.967 --> 18:49.934
Man, over radio:
Charlie one, copy, out.

18:50.001 --> 18:52.034
Stand by...

18:52.934 --> 18:55.301
Contact!
contact!

19:00.267 --> 19:02.600
Man, over radio:
man down!
man down!

19:02.667 --> 19:04.201
Casualty--Charlie three.

19:04.267 --> 19:07.600
You and your science
just let this bastard
lead us into an ambush.

19:07.667 --> 19:10.767
Man, over radio:
man down! man down!

19:16.934 --> 19:19.667
Hey! no! back off!

19:21.468 --> 19:23.101
All right. hey.

19:23.167 --> 19:24.567
What did he just say
to you? what did he
say to you?

19:24.633 --> 19:26.800
He said, "kill me now,
it would be an honor."

19:26.867 --> 19:28.834
You meant it,
didn't you?

19:28.900 --> 19:30.334
Who are you now?
huh? who are you?

19:30.401 --> 19:32.234
My Taliban name
is Khaled.
yeah?

19:32.301 --> 19:34.234
My name is Mo--short
for Mohammed.

19:34.301 --> 19:36.034
Man, over radio:
zero, Charlie one,
Charlie three's hit bad.

19:36.101 --> 19:37.334
Wait. out.

19:37.401 --> 19:39.234
Oh!

19:39.301 --> 19:41.533
Did you or did you not
send my men into an ambush?

19:41.600 --> 19:42.767
I did not!

19:42.834 --> 19:44.900
I told you it was
a Taliban hideout.

19:44.967 --> 19:47.067
Did you expect it
to be guarded?

19:49.201 --> 19:51.567
Maybe you underestimate
your enemy.

19:51.633 --> 19:52.500
No, wait!
no, wait!

19:52.567 --> 19:55.101
Hey, he's telling
the truth.

19:55.167 --> 20:00.334
No, he was as
shocked as you are
by what happened.

20:00.401 --> 20:03.301
And you're not going
to kill an unarmed man
in cold blood

20:03.368 --> 20:05.101
Just out
of sheer frustration,
so knock it off.

20:05.167 --> 20:07.468
All right?

20:11.468 --> 20:14.134
You know that man?

20:14.201 --> 20:15.500
You know
that man?

20:15.567 --> 20:16.800
I've never
seen him before.

20:16.867 --> 20:17.834
Do you know that man?

20:17.900 --> 20:19.800
I've never seen him
before.

20:21.134 --> 20:23.334
Foster? foster,
who you got in there?

20:23.401 --> 20:26.867
Ed Komisky,
defence department.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.267
Hi, Ed. I see you've met
my friend Franko,

20:29.334 --> 20:30.800
Oh, a little bit ago.

20:30.867 --> 20:32.067
There you go.

20:37.434 --> 20:40.934
Is he one of the ones
who sent you here?

20:41.001 --> 20:42.934
Hey?

20:43.001 --> 20:47.101
Is he the one
that sent you here?

20:48.334 --> 20:49.934
What did he tell you?
what did he tell you?

20:50.001 --> 20:51.201
Did he tell you
you were gonna be a hero?

20:51.267 --> 20:52.700
Did he tell you you were
gonna be a patriot?

20:52.767 --> 20:55.600
Is that...
what then, eh?
then what?

20:55.667 --> 20:58.500
Oh, that's between
you and him?

20:58.567 --> 21:01.301
Well, I'll be very happy to set
up that face-to-face meeting,

21:01.368 --> 21:03.468
But right now, we've got
some mess to clear up,

21:03.533 --> 21:05.334
All right? move. move.

21:05.401 --> 21:06.567
Kill the feed.

21:06.633 --> 21:07.600
Kill the feed!

21:07.667 --> 21:09.167
what,
he's shutting us out?

21:09.234 --> 21:10.700
Get him on
the sat-phone.

21:10.767 --> 21:13.001
Order him to
give us eyes back.

21:13.067 --> 21:14.934
Yeah, if you think
Cal Lightman is gonna jump

21:15.001 --> 21:16.600
Just because you bark,
you don't know the man.

21:16.667 --> 21:18.267
Trust me.

21:18.334 --> 21:20.368
Call me
if he comes back on-line.

21:20.434 --> 21:22.468
You know Franko,
don't you?

21:22.533 --> 21:24.667
The only reason I'm here

21:24.734 --> 21:26.401
Is because I want
to see those two marines

21:26.468 --> 21:27.734
Returned home alive.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.101
Us, too.

21:30.567 --> 21:33.167
Look at you, huh?
look at you.

21:33.234 --> 21:36.001
A minute ago, you said
you were willing to die

21:36.067 --> 21:38.567
At this man's hand,
it would be an honor.

21:38.633 --> 21:39.500
Now look at you.

21:39.567 --> 21:41.401
You'd anything you can
to get home

21:41.468 --> 21:44.201
Just because of what you saw
on that sat-link.

21:44.267 --> 21:46.167
Man, over radio:
zero, Charlie one, over.

21:46.234 --> 21:48.234
Casualty, Charlie three.

21:48.301 --> 21:49.500
Chest wound.

21:49.567 --> 21:51.767
Stand by air support
and casevac.

21:51.834 --> 21:53.734
Stand by for coordinates.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.867
If he calls in
an air strike, right,

21:55.934 --> 21:57.834
In a matter of minutes,
a lot of people are gonna die.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.468
Doesn't matter
what side you're on.

21:59.533 --> 22:01.301
When I got here,

22:01.368 --> 22:05.201
You thought I was here
to help you, didn't you?

22:05.267 --> 22:06.967
Didn't you?

22:07.034 --> 22:08.700
There's another way in.

22:08.767 --> 22:10.867
Where?

22:10.934 --> 22:12.067
When did you get hooked,
Dr. Lightman?

22:12.134 --> 22:14.368
Let's go! let's go!
hurry the hell up.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.134
What? what?

22:16.201 --> 22:18.034
On war. on this.

22:18.101 --> 22:19.167
You get high on being
in the middle of it all.

22:19.234 --> 22:20.167
Don't you?

22:20.234 --> 22:21.567
Don't you? I can
see it in your face.

22:21.633 --> 22:22.934
Why are you--
why are you doing this?

22:23.001 --> 22:24.001
Ok, you know what?

22:24.067 --> 22:25.734
There is no
other way in.
they're dead.

22:25.800 --> 22:29.301
Look, I told you,
you lie, I lie.

22:31.134 --> 22:33.201
All right, Bosnia, 1994.

22:33.267 --> 22:34.734
I didn't see direct action,

22:34.800 --> 22:39.800
But I was
this close to it.

22:39.867 --> 22:43.234
You get lucky just one time.
you survive, right?

22:43.301 --> 22:45.334
It's the rush.
there's no--

22:45.401 --> 22:46.700
There's nothing like it.

22:46.767 --> 22:48.234
It's delusions
of immortality.

22:48.301 --> 22:49.667
Right? right?

22:49.734 --> 22:51.834
You're enjoying this.

22:51.900 --> 22:57.434
No, no. no, no.
now. now it's your turn.

22:57.500 --> 23:00.934
You owe me the other
tunnel to that cave.

23:01.001 --> 23:02.034
Tell them to go left--

23:02.101 --> 23:04.867
No. you tell 'em.
you tell 'em.

23:04.934 --> 23:06.267
You tell him!
you tell him!

23:06.334 --> 23:07.934
Tell them to go left
about a hundred yards.

23:08.001 --> 23:11.334
There's a rock
with an arch in it.

23:11.401 --> 23:13.201
This doesn't work,
he's done.

23:13.267 --> 23:15.234
Yeah, well,
so am I.

23:16.767 --> 23:18.134
Charlie call signs...

23:18.201 --> 23:22.134
This isn't just
a test of trust,
is it?

23:22.201 --> 23:23.134
Right.

23:23.201 --> 23:24.567
You're playing this game

23:24.633 --> 23:25.667
Because you think
that if this mission
goes south,

23:25.734 --> 23:27.734
Then you're not
the only one to blame.

23:27.800 --> 23:30.567
But if it succeeds,

23:30.633 --> 23:35.600
I'm gonna become your
brother in arms, right?

23:35.667 --> 23:37.167
I'm gonna be more
likely to help you

23:37.234 --> 23:39.900
Somewhere down the road,
right?

23:41.967 --> 23:44.134
Don't hold your breath.

23:45.734 --> 23:51.667
Ms. Lenox, what do you
know about Ed Komisky?

23:51.734 --> 23:53.001
Mr. komisky
is a hangover

23:53.067 --> 23:54.667
From previous
administrations.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.734
Man's more like
a pentagon ghost.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.201
We're beginning to think
that he was involved

23:58.267 --> 23:59.533
In some sort of operation

23:59.600 --> 24:01.533
Which abandoned this man
Franko in Afghanistan.

24:01.600 --> 24:02.700
Are you aware of
any such operations?

24:02.767 --> 24:03.700
No.

24:03.767 --> 24:06.001
You don't want
to think about it?

24:06.067 --> 24:07.767
I know of no operations
involving Franco.

24:07.834 --> 24:08.967
No records exist of CIA

24:09.034 --> 24:11.034
Or any other
agency's involvement.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.700
But he could be
an agency asset

24:12.767 --> 24:14.667
That you have never
heard about?

24:14.734 --> 24:15.767
No. I understand
what you're asking.

24:15.834 --> 24:17.700
But I'm not sure
I can get

24:17.767 --> 24:19.101
Any answers quicker than
you can.

24:19.167 --> 24:20.533
Franko's aunt.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.267
I need her here as soon
as possible.

24:22.334 --> 24:23.468
Can you do that?

24:23.533 --> 24:24.867
Hey, Lightman's
back on line.

24:24.934 --> 24:26.368
He needs our eyes and
ears for this next part.

24:26.434 --> 24:27.533
We never had--

24:27.600 --> 24:29.900
Never had this
conversation.
I got it.

24:34.468 --> 24:36.167
If I help get
these marines out,

24:36.234 --> 24:37.401
I want my story told.

24:37.468 --> 24:39.134
That's above my pay grade,
pal. dream on.

24:39.201 --> 24:40.700
It's right at
my pay grade,

24:40.767 --> 24:42.468
If your story's true.

24:42.533 --> 24:44.267
Well, that's
the back entrance
into the cave.

24:44.334 --> 24:46.301
They're gonna hit a tunnel.

24:46.368 --> 24:49.267
And they can go
one of two directions.

24:51.034 --> 24:53.667
Left?
left is bad.

24:53.734 --> 24:55.167
Charlie one, move right,
over.

24:55.234 --> 24:56.167
No, no, no!
wait, wait, wait!

24:56.234 --> 24:57.267
Wait a second!

24:57.334 --> 24:58.434
If this is a back way
into the cave,

24:58.500 --> 24:59.633
It's also a back way out.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.034
We mount a frontal assault.

25:01.101 --> 25:02.734
That way they'll try and
haul ass out the back way

25:02.800 --> 25:04.334
With the prisoners.

25:04.401 --> 25:06.800
That's what I'd do.

25:06.867 --> 25:08.967
How about you, eh?

25:10.101 --> 25:11.167
Hold, positions, Charlie one,

25:11.234 --> 25:12.533
Hold positions.
set evac charges.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.101
Stand by for enemy, over.

25:15.167 --> 25:16.533
That's not Florida.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.334
Emily...
how did you get in here?

25:18.401 --> 25:19.533
You lied to me.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.533
He lied to me.

25:20.600 --> 25:21.667
Charlie one,
hold positions.

25:21.734 --> 25:22.900
Set evac charge.

25:22.967 --> 25:24.533
Stand by for enemy.
over.

25:24.600 --> 25:25.767
Em!

25:33.468 --> 25:34.934
Dad?

25:35.001 --> 25:36.667
Emily.

25:36.734 --> 25:37.700
Dad?

25:41.900 --> 25:43.600
Dad!

25:46.968 --> 25:48.234
did he just get...

25:48.300 --> 25:51.501
No, no, no,
he didn't.

25:55.133 --> 25:57.601
Man, over radio: Charlie one,
move to alternate cave entrance.

25:57.667 --> 25:59.701
Complete.

25:59.767 --> 26:02.234
Charlie three, Charlie three,
zero alpha, over!

26:02.300 --> 26:04.200
How'd the Taliban
find us?

26:04.267 --> 26:05.934
They got his radio
when he was hit.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.934
They used it for directions
to find us here.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.901
Fire support,
confirm position.

26:11.767 --> 26:13.934
Moving through tunnel now.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.067
Going firm
at tunnel intersection.

26:19.501 --> 26:22.234
Contact! contact!

26:22.300 --> 26:24.300
Marine prisoners and Taliban!

26:24.367 --> 26:25.734
3 Taliban dead.

26:25.801 --> 26:26.968
Zero, this is
alpha whiskey.

26:27.033 --> 26:28.300
Evac complete.

26:28.367 --> 26:30.367
We have the two marines
and rescue team complete.

26:30.434 --> 26:31.601
Setting evac charges now.
over.

26:31.667 --> 26:32.968
Copy that.

26:33.033 --> 26:35.901
Alpha whiskey one standing by
waiting for your signal. over.

26:37.467 --> 26:40.734
Need medic on board
with all his toys. over.

26:44.567 --> 26:47.133
It's a direct hit.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.400
The radios are dead
for good.

26:49.467 --> 26:51.133
They're out there
on their own now.

26:51.200 --> 26:52.834
Wait. what about us?

26:52.901 --> 26:54.934
You got any contingencies?

26:55.000 --> 26:57.801
In the event
of loss of comms

26:57.868 --> 26:59.567
During contact
with the enemy,

26:59.634 --> 27:01.300
We have 20 minutes to
haul ass out of here.

27:01.367 --> 27:02.567
What happens
in 20 minutes?

27:02.634 --> 27:05.167
Smart bombs turn
this place into
a parking lot.

27:05.234 --> 27:06.300
And everything in it.

27:06.367 --> 27:07.567
So the only way that you
can get out of here

27:07.634 --> 27:09.367
Is if you lure the enemy
into the kill zone,

27:09.434 --> 27:10.968
Which happens to be...
right?

27:11.033 --> 27:12.100
Copy that.

27:12.167 --> 27:13.267
Oh, thank you
very much.

27:13.334 --> 27:14.667
All right,
you wait here.

27:14.734 --> 27:17.133
If I'm not back
in 18 minutes,

27:17.200 --> 27:18.934
You leave by that door.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.634
You know how to use that?

27:27.567 --> 27:29.300
Not bad
for a scientist.

27:29.367 --> 27:31.200
I've had my moments.

27:36.534 --> 27:37.834
Terrific.

27:37.901 --> 27:39.534
We've got 17 minutes.

27:39.601 --> 27:42.467
You want to tell me
about your moments?

27:42.534 --> 27:45.567
That game's over now.
yeah, I mean...

27:45.634 --> 27:48.133
Besides, you're
the one who wants
his story told, so...

27:48.200 --> 27:49.834
How badly you want
to hear it?

27:52.801 --> 27:54.334
All right, well,

27:54.400 --> 27:56.267
The answer's probably
gonna stay in this
room anyway. go on.

27:56.334 --> 27:57.834
Ask your question.

27:57.901 --> 27:59.267
What did you do
in Bosnia?

27:59.334 --> 28:00.601
Intelligence.

28:00.667 --> 28:03.267
You seem like you don't want
to really talk about it.

28:03.334 --> 28:04.934
Why is that?

28:05.000 --> 28:06.167
Well, the past
is the past, right?

28:06.234 --> 28:07.734
I can relate to that.

28:07.801 --> 28:10.267
I know that
you're trying to get
some common ground

28:10.334 --> 28:12.801
Between us, all right,
Khaled,

28:12.868 --> 28:15.767
But I didn't betray
my country.

28:15.834 --> 28:18.100
You betrayed something.

28:18.167 --> 28:19.767
Yeah, I betrayed myself.
how about you?

28:22.033 --> 28:24.100
Mr. Komisky,
a moment of your time?

28:24.167 --> 28:26.000
You too, Torres.

28:27.601 --> 28:30.901
My real name is
specialist glen welsh.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.501
What branch
of the military
were you in?

28:35.567 --> 28:40.467
Uh, back to Bosnia,
your betrayal.

28:40.534 --> 28:41.634
All right.

28:41.701 --> 28:45.834
Sarajevo. '94.

28:45.901 --> 28:48.868
Right, we were
interrogating
a Serb officer

28:48.934 --> 28:50.067
About his
sniper positions.

28:50.133 --> 28:51.300
We?

28:51.367 --> 28:53.868
Yeah. mi6,
British intelligence.

28:53.934 --> 28:55.901
And I didn't
believe him,

28:55.968 --> 28:57.567
So we changed
his clothes

28:57.634 --> 29:00.300
And chocked him out
into sniper alley.

29:00.367 --> 29:02.033
He lasted 4 seconds,

29:02.100 --> 29:05.300
Got about 18 feet-ish.

29:05.367 --> 29:07.000
His information
was accurate.

29:07.067 --> 29:09.267
But he was the enemy,
right?

29:10.667 --> 29:13.300
I'm a scientist. I'm
not an executioner.

29:13.367 --> 29:15.601
War got the better
of you, too.

29:15.667 --> 29:17.067
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
now your turn.

29:17.133 --> 29:20.834
I was aiming
for special ops.

29:20.901 --> 29:23.934
Before I got there,
'99,

29:24.000 --> 29:25.501
I got in a bar fight.

29:25.567 --> 29:27.434
They threw me in the brig
for three years.

29:27.501 --> 29:28.667
Manslaughter.

29:28.734 --> 29:30.968
I could tell you
my drinks were spiked,

29:31.033 --> 29:32.267
But what would you care,
right?

29:32.334 --> 29:33.767
Right.

29:33.834 --> 29:37.300
Two years later,
and this is right after 9/11,

29:37.367 --> 29:41.734
I got jumped in the brig
and was thrown in the hospital.

29:41.801 --> 29:43.300
Somebody had knifed me
in my back.

29:43.367 --> 29:45.567
That's when they
offered me a way out.

29:45.634 --> 29:48.400
That man you saw
on the sat-link.

29:48.467 --> 29:49.634
Yeah?

29:52.767 --> 29:53.667
Ms. Perriman.

29:53.734 --> 29:56.067
Franko's aunt Wendy?

29:56.133 --> 29:59.434
Franko?
is he alive?

29:59.501 --> 30:01.167
Where is he?

30:08.300 --> 30:11.601
And they moved you straight
from the brig hospital

30:11.667 --> 30:13.267
To a training facility,
right?

30:13.334 --> 30:14.634
Uh-huh.
where?

30:14.701 --> 30:16.267
Somewhere out west.
I don't know exactly.

30:16.334 --> 30:18.334
They didn't tell me--
you know,

30:18.400 --> 30:20.300
It looked a lot like this
hell hole.

30:20.367 --> 30:21.567
All right,
and they trained you
to do what?

30:23.601 --> 30:25.300
They taught me Pashto.

30:25.367 --> 30:27.000
They--they put me through

30:27.067 --> 30:29.000
Their own brand
of special ops training.

30:29.067 --> 30:31.834
And then they dropped
me in the middle of
Taliban territory,

30:31.901 --> 30:34.701
Posing as an aid worker
with Shia sympathies.

30:34.767 --> 30:37.767
You know, they said
they were gonna be watching me,

30:37.834 --> 30:39.434
That they'd have my back

30:39.501 --> 30:41.801
And that they'd pull me out
when the time was right.

30:41.868 --> 30:43.200
All right,
but they didn't.

30:43.267 --> 30:44.200
They never came back
for you, right?

30:44.267 --> 30:45.701
Yeah.

30:45.767 --> 30:47.534
They betrayed you,
right, so you went over
to the other side.

30:47.601 --> 30:49.767
Is that it?

30:49.834 --> 30:51.901
Did you ever kill any
American troops?

30:51.968 --> 30:53.534
No.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.968
That's a bloody lie.

30:56.033 --> 30:58.400
No. no. look.

30:58.467 --> 31:03.534
Look, look, you try
to shoot over their heads,

31:03.601 --> 31:08.033
But those bastards,
they just keep
shooting back.

31:09.801 --> 31:13.400
What? what?
what are you doing?

31:15.067 --> 31:19.267
Ah! aah!

31:19.334 --> 31:21.667
Hold still!
hold still!

31:26.000 --> 31:27.467
How did the people
that put you here,

31:27.534 --> 31:28.667
How did they know
how to find you?

31:28.734 --> 31:30.234
How were they
tracking you? eh?

31:30.300 --> 31:32.467
I think I know.
I think I know.

31:34.234 --> 31:35.734
Hold still!
if I'm right,

31:35.801 --> 31:37.834
This is gonna prove
your story's real.

31:37.901 --> 31:41.033
What the hell
are you doing,
Lightman?

31:41.100 --> 31:43.267
All of you, you have to help me
hold him still!

31:43.334 --> 31:44.467
Hold him still!

31:44.534 --> 31:46.434
Hey, we gotta go!
we gotta go right now!

31:46.501 --> 31:47.667
Not until
I've done this!

31:47.734 --> 31:48.801
You listen to orders!

31:48.868 --> 31:50.167
I often have orders
from the president.

31:50.234 --> 31:51.601
Did I forget
to mention that?

31:51.667 --> 31:53.167
Now hold him still.

31:53.234 --> 31:54.501
Aah!

31:54.567 --> 31:55.601
All right, give me
the pliers.

31:55.667 --> 31:57.000
The pliers!

31:58.901 --> 32:01.033
Aah!

32:04.100 --> 32:07.067
My sister, peg, died
giving birth to Franko.

32:07.133 --> 32:10.601
And I raised him
just like he was my own.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.434
Have you two
met before?

32:15.501 --> 32:18.067
No.

32:19.267 --> 32:21.901
What elementary school
did Franko go to?

32:21.968 --> 32:25.067
Who was his first
girlfriend?

32:27.234 --> 32:29.234
Ms. Perriman...

32:29.300 --> 32:33.100
I believe you really did have a
sister who died in childbirth,

32:33.167 --> 32:34.534
Which is what makes
your story believable...

32:34.601 --> 32:35.567
To the layman.

32:35.634 --> 32:37.334
It's not a story.

32:37.400 --> 32:39.200
Do you carry a picture
of your nephew?

32:39.267 --> 32:40.834
I just--I imagine
over the years

32:40.901 --> 32:42.133
Of not knowing
where he is

32:42.200 --> 32:43.634
Or if he's even alive,

32:43.701 --> 32:44.934
It might be a great
comfort to you,

32:45.000 --> 32:46.300
You know, a symbol of hope
top have some--

32:46.367 --> 32:47.267
that's enough.

32:47.334 --> 32:49.434
You don't have
to answer that.

32:51.634 --> 32:53.467
They came to me
after 9/11.

32:53.534 --> 32:57.434
My sister's death didn't have
to be for nothing, they said.

32:57.501 --> 32:59.400
She's definitely
telling the truth.

32:59.467 --> 33:02.167
Now, I can tell you want
to get this out,

33:02.234 --> 33:03.534
So please keep going,
Ms. Perriman.

33:03.601 --> 33:05.968
Someone from the CIA
did come to me.

33:06.033 --> 33:11.634
I guess it was
like an acting role...

33:11.701 --> 33:13.067
For my country.

33:13.133 --> 33:16.133
You gotta understand,
I wanted

33:16.200 --> 33:17.567
To do something.

33:17.634 --> 33:19.434
We all wanted
to do something.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.934
Including you, sir.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.200
I believe that.

33:27.267 --> 33:29.601
But you sent a man
into Afghanistan

33:29.667 --> 33:30.868
To infiltrate
the Taliban.

33:30.934 --> 33:32.534
Then what? you just
forget about him?

33:32.601 --> 33:34.200
Or you just leave
him there to rot?

33:34.267 --> 33:35.200
Or worse.

33:35.267 --> 33:36.234
We lost him.

33:36.300 --> 33:37.868
The battery in his
tracking device died.

33:37.934 --> 33:40.467
The battery?
it happens.

33:40.534 --> 33:43.634
Know how hard it is to find
anyone out there?

33:43.701 --> 33:45.501
I've heard.

33:45.567 --> 33:46.968
We kept waiting
for him to show up,

33:47.033 --> 33:50.067
And when he didn't,
we assumed he was dead.

33:50.133 --> 33:54.501
So please, take your
sanctimonious judgement

33:54.567 --> 33:56.200
And park it
somewhere else.

34:02.167 --> 34:04.067
Aah!

34:05.734 --> 34:07.133
Snow.

34:07.200 --> 34:08.534
If we don't
get out of here,

34:08.601 --> 34:10.501
It'll be the last white
Christmas we ever see.

34:10.567 --> 34:12.167
Not until I finish.
not until I finish.
hold on.

34:12.234 --> 34:13.400
Aah!

34:13.467 --> 34:15.300
Hey, hey, hey,
hold still!

34:15.367 --> 34:18.033
Aah!

34:18.100 --> 34:21.167
There.

34:21.234 --> 34:23.367
It's a tracking device.

34:23.434 --> 34:24.667
Two-year battery life.

34:24.734 --> 34:25.833
He is one of ours.

34:25.900 --> 34:27.033
Why didn't you tell us

34:27.100 --> 34:28.033
Who you were
in the beginning?

34:28.100 --> 34:29.199
Orders.

34:29.266 --> 34:30.601
I disobey, I'm dead.

34:30.667 --> 34:33.033
The only person
I reveal my
identity to

34:33.100 --> 34:34.534
Is the man
with the code.
nobody else!

34:35.601 --> 34:39.033
The code is aunt Wendy.

34:39.100 --> 34:40.333
Well, that's a reason.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.300
But it's not
a real reason, is it?

34:42.367 --> 34:43.801
Come on, you can do
better than that.

34:43.868 --> 34:46.868
And these bastards caught
me, and they beat me.

34:46.934 --> 34:48.667
Yeah. I was Taliban.

34:48.734 --> 34:50.501
Well, that's better.

34:50.567 --> 34:52.501
So, who are you now, eh?

34:52.567 --> 34:55.967
You're the expert.
you tell me.

35:00.901 --> 35:02.334
You tell your mom?

35:02.400 --> 35:03.334
No.

35:03.400 --> 35:04.601
Why not?

35:04.667 --> 35:06.501
Same reason you
didn't tell me.

35:06.567 --> 35:08.501
Don't you think
you should tell her?

35:08.567 --> 35:11.400
He can tell her
when he gets back.

35:18.133 --> 35:21.200
Move out!
let's go, go!

35:26.033 --> 35:28.467
Let's go! move, move!

35:28.534 --> 35:30.701
Move, go!

35:32.367 --> 35:34.334
Lightman,
you're out of here!

35:34.400 --> 35:36.400
no. no, no, no.

35:36.467 --> 35:37.968
We saw it on your face
earlier, right?

35:38.033 --> 35:39.801
You've got orders never to let
this man leave this room alive,

35:39.868 --> 35:42.033
Don't you? eh?

35:42.100 --> 35:44.033
Am I right?

35:46.901 --> 35:50.567
These men remind you
of what you wanted to be,

35:50.634 --> 35:51.734
All right?

35:51.801 --> 35:53.000
And so now it's about
a last fight you fight

35:53.067 --> 35:54.434
And which side of the fight
you're on,

35:54.501 --> 35:57.300
All right, and if you
finally get to do

35:57.367 --> 36:00.234
What you came here
in the first place to do.

36:00.300 --> 36:02.601
Ok?

36:02.667 --> 36:04.834
I need 45 seconds
of fight out of him

36:04.901 --> 36:06.033
To clear the tunnel.

36:06.100 --> 36:08.234
Here.

36:20.567 --> 36:22.133
Where's home?

36:22.200 --> 36:23.801
1245 glen view park,
Iowa city.

36:23.868 --> 36:26.567
Say it again!
say it again!
say it again!

36:26.634 --> 36:30.868
12245 glen view park,
Iowa city.

36:58.033 --> 36:59.467
Nice job, doc!

36:59.534 --> 37:01.367
Not really!

37:13.301 --> 37:15.467
That's him.

37:21.001 --> 37:22.800
Heard you helped
get us out.

37:22.867 --> 37:24.467
Thank you.

37:24.533 --> 37:26.667
No. thank you.

37:56.834 --> 37:59.700
Dr. Lightman.

38:02.201 --> 38:05.867
Oh. the real
aunt Wendy.

38:05.934 --> 38:09.433
Please don't do this.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.867
This is a matter
of national security.

38:11.934 --> 38:15.700
What story
did you people tell
specialist welsh,

38:15.767 --> 38:17.467
Franko's, family?

38:17.533 --> 38:19.334
Killed in action?

38:19.400 --> 38:21.167
Died in the brig?

38:21.234 --> 38:24.167
Oh, died
in the brig.
nice one.

38:24.234 --> 38:25.533
I was serving
my country.

38:25.600 --> 38:29.034
Oh, yeah?
our country, you mean.

38:29.101 --> 38:30.634
It's our country.

38:30.700 --> 38:32.734
It's about time
you let that one
go, mate.

38:32.800 --> 38:35.268
You go public with this,
you'll be breaking the law.

38:35.334 --> 38:36.767
I'm not going public
with it.

38:36.834 --> 38:37.967
I'm gonna tell
a man's family

38:38.034 --> 38:38.967
The truth about
their son.

38:39.034 --> 38:40.167
You know what I mean.

38:40.234 --> 38:43.700
You know...
sooner or later

38:43.767 --> 38:46.667
You got to stand up
and be counted for
our mistakes, right?

38:46.734 --> 38:48.634
Your man, Franko,
he went over...

38:48.700 --> 38:50.500
To the Taliban.

38:50.567 --> 38:51.934
That's a big mistake.

38:52.001 --> 38:54.667
But in the end...

38:54.734 --> 38:57.034
You know what I mean?

38:59.500 --> 39:00.967
Mr. welsh?

39:01.034 --> 39:02.867
Yeah, but what's
going on out here?

39:02.934 --> 39:03.934
Who are you?

39:04.001 --> 39:05.001
Who is it, hon?

39:05.067 --> 39:07.500
Do you mind
if if come in
for a minute?

39:07.567 --> 39:09.101
There's a few things
I'd like to tell you

39:09.167 --> 39:10.533
About your son,
glen.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.867
Glen?

39:11.934 --> 39:14.934
Do you mind?

39:18.500 --> 39:20.167
Happy holidays.

39:21.001 --> 39:23.334
Dr. Lightman...

39:26.400 --> 39:28.467
Would you let me
do the talking?

39:28.533 --> 39:31.767
Just so long as
it's the truth.

39:46.034 --> 39:49.234
He's late.

39:49.301 --> 39:50.533
Yeah.
Midwest is snowed under.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.167
Delays everywhere.

39:52.234 --> 39:54.800
Yeah. my mom's stuck
in St. Louis.

39:54.867 --> 39:57.368

40:25.101 --> 40:27.001
Hi.

40:27.067 --> 40:29.301
Hello, darling.

40:38.500 --> 40:41.268
You shouldn't have had
to see that, em.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.001
I was scared, dad.

40:48.067 --> 40:50.433
I was really scared.

41:02.667 --> 41:07.800
So is it naive
to ask you,
beg you really,

41:07.867 --> 41:09.500
Never to do anything
like that again?

41:09.567 --> 41:12.634
No.

41:14.234 --> 41:18.067
Well, yeah.

41:22.433 --> 41:23.767

41:50.800 --> 41:53.268
Good.
