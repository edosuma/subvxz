WEBVTT

00:00.789 --> 00:03.257
- Okay, there you go, Phil.
- And there you go, Art.

00:03.259 --> 00:07.389
That baseball is a real
piece of Chicago Cubs history.

00:07.414 --> 00:10.175
It's so weird the Cubs
are so good now, huh?

00:10.200 --> 00:11.950
Thank God for the Bull, the Bears

00:11.975 --> 00:13.641
and Rahm Emanuel, hmm?

00:14.254 --> 00:15.291
Morning.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.338
Hey, Tush, remember Phil?

00:17.363 --> 00:19.329
His cousin owns this, uh,
sports memorabilia shop.

00:19.354 --> 00:21.054
Look what he got me. Mm?

00:21.267 --> 00:23.960
The very ball that Ernie Banks
hit for his 502nd home run.

00:23.985 --> 00:25.251
Sweet.

00:25.276 --> 00:28.277
Hey, does your cousin
sell any WNBA swag?

00:28.302 --> 00:31.203
I cannot get enough of those lanky gals.

00:32.830 --> 00:34.197
Last week, at the supermarket,

00:34.222 --> 00:37.195
I saw one of them bite into a
pumpkin like it was an apple.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.461
I'll keep my eyes open.

00:40.767 --> 00:42.066
See ya later, Arthur.

00:42.599 --> 00:44.032
So, you gonna put that in your shrine?

00:44.057 --> 00:47.324
Yep. Right up alongside
my Ron Santo bobblehead

00:47.349 --> 00:50.272
and my jar of Chicago
Blackhawks knocked out teeth.

00:53.289 --> 00:55.288
Hey, Franco, you're 40 minutes late.

00:55.313 --> 00:57.530
I had to stock all the
bottom shelves myself.

00:57.555 --> 00:59.968
You know I'm rolling the dice
every time I have to bend down.

00:59.993 --> 01:02.929
Oh? Oh, yeah? I'm sorry
you had a tough morning.

01:02.954 --> 01:04.287
Mine was just swell.

01:04.312 --> 01:06.351
I got off the "L" train,
this cop stopped me,

01:06.376 --> 01:08.743
threw me up against the
fence and frisked me.

01:08.768 --> 01:10.276
- That's messed up.
- Mm-hmm.

01:10.301 --> 01:11.402
Wait, was it a lady cop?

01:11.427 --> 01:13.277
- No.
- That's messed up.

01:15.798 --> 01:17.306
They can't do that.
That's racial profiling.

01:17.331 --> 01:18.697
Yeah, that's terrible.

01:18.722 --> 01:20.855
Hey, by the way, you're not
doing yourself any favors

01:20.887 --> 01:22.954
by walking around in that hoodie.

01:23.223 --> 01:24.727
You saying this is my fault?

01:24.752 --> 01:26.585
No, I'm just saying
that it makes you look

01:26.610 --> 01:28.555
a little bit more, you
know, uh, suspicious.

01:28.580 --> 01:31.594
Suspic... Dude, it's got a
cartoon dragon on the back.

01:33.232 --> 01:34.399
And this isn't about my hoodie.

01:34.424 --> 01:35.857
I got stop-and-frisked
'cause I'm black.

01:35.882 --> 01:38.149
Man, the cops in this
city are out of control.

01:38.174 --> 01:39.974
All right, hang on.

01:40.035 --> 01:41.734
I'm sorry that happened to you,

01:41.736 --> 01:44.137
but I am tired of people
blaming us for everything.

01:44.139 --> 01:46.973
Look, it's a war zone out there,

01:46.975 --> 01:50.343
and some cops are leaning
on the stop-and-frisk,

01:50.345 --> 01:52.978
but that's just 'cause we're
trying to keep people safe.

01:53.003 --> 01:55.748
So what, you two have no problem
with this cop stopping me?

01:55.750 --> 01:56.916
We weren't there.

01:56.918 --> 01:59.485
We don't know what
the circumstances were.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.187
Did you get the cop's name?

02:01.189 --> 02:02.589
I think it was Officer Li.

02:02.591 --> 02:05.566
I know Li. He's a good cop.

02:05.591 --> 02:09.027
Last week, he totally had
my back on a drug bust.

02:09.030 --> 02:12.789
He cuffed four methheads,
and those dudes are wiggly.

02:15.416 --> 02:18.315
Well, it's-it's not just
cops. I took a psych class,

02:18.340 --> 02:20.139
and we learned that lots
of people make decisions

02:20.141 --> 02:21.807
based on race without being aware of it.

02:21.832 --> 02:23.401
It's called unconscious bias.

02:23.426 --> 02:24.940
Oh, how refreshing.

02:24.965 --> 02:27.332
How has society disappointed you today?

02:29.350 --> 02:31.977
Well, since you asked, lots
of people don't realize...

02:32.002 --> 02:33.916
Honey, it was a joke.
I really don't care.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.725
See? Sexism.

02:38.727 --> 02:39.957
Exactly what I'm talking about.

02:39.982 --> 02:42.880
And while most of us don't
flaunt our ignorances like Fawz...

02:42.905 --> 02:44.357
Thanks, baby.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.901
... we all carry these
unconscious biases.

02:47.903 --> 02:50.299
She's right. Every time
I see a white person,

02:50.324 --> 02:53.025
I automatically think they
know where a dog park is.

02:54.929 --> 02:57.630
And it turns out, they do.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.280
I don't know, Maya.

03:00.282 --> 03:02.248
I'm sure some people
are biased like that,

03:02.250 --> 03:03.583
but not the people in here.

03:03.585 --> 03:04.884
Oh, you don't believe me?

03:04.886 --> 03:06.986
Okay. I'm just gonna use this app

03:06.988 --> 03:08.431
to call it out whenever I hear it.

03:08.456 --> 03:09.985
Yeah, well, you won't hear it from me.

03:10.010 --> 03:13.259
I don't see color. I hired
a black kid, didn't I?

03:14.963 --> 03:17.253
Oh, well, that's not gonna be annoying.

03:18.370 --> 03:20.466
Trust me, there was nothing unconscious

03:20.468 --> 03:22.135
about this cop's bias.

03:22.137 --> 03:24.237
And, of course, I couldn't
talk back, or I'd be

03:24.239 --> 03:25.772
calling one of y'all to save my skin.

03:25.774 --> 03:29.242
Oop, did someone say skin?

03:29.244 --> 03:31.043
Let me tell you about my latest gig.

03:31.068 --> 03:32.745
I'm selling this line of high-end,

03:32.747 --> 03:34.231
organic skin care products.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.116
Well, that's a smooth segue.

03:37.118 --> 03:39.085
Speaking of smooth...

03:39.087 --> 03:41.688
I could offer you guys a
lifetime of soft, supple,

03:41.690 --> 03:42.809
smooth skin.

03:42.834 --> 03:43.957
Randy, you look...

03:43.982 --> 03:45.543
Don't you dare.

03:47.457 --> 03:49.228
Look, instead of complaining,

03:49.230 --> 03:51.197
why don't we do something
to try to fix it?

03:51.199 --> 03:54.300
We could have a
community outreach night.

03:54.302 --> 03:55.126
And what's that?

03:55.151 --> 03:56.734
Oh, it's a way for
people in the neighborhood

03:56.766 --> 03:58.932
to get to know their beat
cops, air their grievances.

03:59.390 --> 04:00.690
Hey, we can have it right here.

04:00.809 --> 04:03.269
Did somebody say "clogged pores"?

04:04.546 --> 04:06.713
This detoxifying clay mask

04:06.715 --> 04:08.659
is good for all skin types and colors:

04:08.684 --> 04:11.385
white, black... you.

04:16.966 --> 04:19.137
You know, an outreach
meeting might be dope.

04:19.161 --> 04:20.129
You know, I can tell that cop

04:20.154 --> 04:22.161
I have as much right to
walk the streets as he does.

04:22.163 --> 04:24.708
Yeah. Show him you're
one of the good ones.

04:27.177 --> 04:29.569
Maya, may I please see that phone?

04:33.942 --> 04:35.645
That should cover me for the day.

04:41.075 --> 04:45.036
Synced and corrected by Dragoniod for
www.addic7ed.com

04:47.674 --> 04:50.242
Ah, man, I thought
there'd be lemon bars.

04:50.244 --> 04:51.476
Why?

04:51.478 --> 04:54.246
White people always bring
lemon bars to meetings.

04:58.133 --> 05:00.307
These aren't lemon bars,
they're lemon squares.

05:01.821 --> 05:03.422
Oh.

05:03.424 --> 05:05.057
I see you invited Malcolm,

05:05.082 --> 05:06.619
your new best friend from the building.

05:06.644 --> 05:08.111
Oh, come on, Sweatpants.

05:08.136 --> 05:09.603
We hung out that one time.

05:09.628 --> 05:12.030
And he can watch a basketball
game without talking.

05:12.032 --> 05:13.631
I get emotional.

05:15.843 --> 05:17.670
You used to like that.

05:19.472 --> 05:21.707
- What's up, Mally-Mal?
- Yeah.

05:21.709 --> 05:23.307
Yo, Arthur, meet my friend, Malcolm.

05:23.332 --> 05:24.198
Nice to meet you, Malcolm.

05:24.545 --> 05:25.526
Whoa!

05:25.551 --> 05:27.184
You got some cool sports stuff.

05:27.236 --> 05:28.798
Yeah, you interested in baseball?

05:28.823 --> 05:29.853
Hell yeah.

05:29.878 --> 05:32.814
Well, then you'd be interested
in this little bad boy,

05:32.947 --> 05:35.065
signed by Mr. Ernie Banks himself.

05:35.090 --> 05:37.216
Nice. You're an old-school Cubs fan.

05:37.218 --> 05:39.249
Yeah. I had this bet
with this buddy of mine

05:39.280 --> 05:41.014
that I'd get a Cubs tattoo on my butt

05:41.039 --> 05:43.022
if they ever won the World Series.

05:43.047 --> 05:44.162
Luckily, he died after Game 6.

05:47.261 --> 05:48.694
Yo, Malcolm, thanks for coming, dawg.

05:48.696 --> 05:49.962
Got to let these cops know

05:49.964 --> 05:51.731
that we're all a part of this community.

05:51.733 --> 05:54.333
Hey, I'm just here for the lemon bars.

05:54.335 --> 05:56.502
They're squares.

05:58.305 --> 06:00.606
Hey, Arthur, thanks for hosting.

06:00.608 --> 06:01.906
Ah, damn.

06:01.931 --> 06:03.242
What?

06:03.244 --> 06:04.777
That's the cop that
stop-and-frisked me.

06:05.664 --> 06:07.780
- That's Officer Li?
- Mm-hmm.

06:07.782 --> 06:09.348
How could he be racist?

06:12.052 --> 06:14.620
Making assumptions based
on race... that's bias.

06:14.622 --> 06:15.434
No, no, no.

06:15.459 --> 06:16.789
I was just saying, he's Oriental.

06:16.791 --> 06:18.658
Oh.

06:18.660 --> 06:21.294
You think that's bad...

06:21.296 --> 06:24.063
you wouldn't believe the names
my grandpa used to come up with.

06:24.065 --> 06:26.499
Ooh, ooh, I can guess.

06:26.501 --> 06:28.468
- Oh, no...
- No.

06:28.470 --> 06:31.241
Hey, it's my man from the "L" train.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.851
Hey. I'm surprised you recognize me

06:32.876 --> 06:35.141
without my face smashed
up against the fence.

06:35.143 --> 06:37.710
Sorry, brother. Thought
you were somebody else.

06:37.712 --> 06:38.744
DeLuca.

06:38.746 --> 06:40.000
Li.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.855
He called me "brother,"
man. That's racist.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.016
No, he's not a racist.

06:44.018 --> 06:45.618
He's just one of those frat guys,

06:45.620 --> 06:47.887
- likes to give people nicknames.
- Mm.

06:47.889 --> 06:50.823
He calls me "Hot Mama."

06:50.825 --> 06:52.892
That's sexist.

06:52.894 --> 06:53.943
Not when it's true.

06:58.565 --> 07:00.433
All right, everybody.

07:00.435 --> 07:01.801
Glad that you're here.

07:01.803 --> 07:04.871
Welcome to the Uptown outreach meeting.

07:04.873 --> 07:08.574
My name is Officer DeLuca,
and I will be facilitating.

07:08.576 --> 07:10.676
So who'd like to go first?

07:10.678 --> 07:11.878
Uh!

07:13.959 --> 07:16.965
I just want to thank all you
hardworking police officers.

07:17.006 --> 07:18.928
You put your lives
on the line every day,

07:18.960 --> 07:19.852
as well as your skin.

07:19.854 --> 07:21.554
That's why I'm offering
a ten percent discount

07:21.556 --> 07:22.889
on all face creams.

07:22.891 --> 07:26.492
While you're locking up
criminals, it locks in moisture.

07:26.494 --> 07:27.743
Sit down, Tush.

07:27.768 --> 07:29.235
Yes, ma'am.

07:29.531 --> 07:32.164
Free samples out back.

07:32.983 --> 07:35.268
Franco, I know you had
something you wanted to say.

07:35.270 --> 07:37.069
Absolutely.

07:38.239 --> 07:40.139
Hi, I'm Franco.

07:40.141 --> 07:41.771
Hi, Franco.

07:42.677 --> 07:45.077
It's not that kind of meeting.

07:47.881 --> 07:50.943
One day at a time, Gladys! You got this!

07:51.719 --> 07:54.620
So, I've lived in this
neighborhood my entire life.

07:54.622 --> 07:57.323
I've never been a threat
to anybody, you know?

07:57.325 --> 08:00.326
But sometimes, I get cold.

08:00.701 --> 08:04.404
So this is what cold Franco looks like.

08:05.133 --> 08:07.233
Regular Franco.

08:07.235 --> 08:09.502
Cold Franco.

08:10.829 --> 08:12.972
Regular Franco.

08:12.974 --> 08:15.675
And, you know, sometimes
I like to exercise,

08:15.677 --> 08:18.244
so if you see me running,

08:18.246 --> 08:20.913
doesn't mean I committed a crime.

08:20.915 --> 08:23.889
Just means I like to jog.

08:23.914 --> 08:25.603
Cold Franco jogging.

08:27.774 --> 08:30.523
Regular Franco jogging.

08:30.525 --> 08:32.091
Thank you.

08:32.092 --> 08:35.967
And my name is Sweatpants.

08:36.086 --> 08:39.198
Ironically, I do not exercise.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.900
So, if I'm running,

08:40.902 --> 08:43.369
I'm definitely running from something.

08:44.037 --> 08:46.587
And maybe you should be running, too.

08:50.210 --> 08:52.044
I thought that meeting went very well.

08:52.046 --> 08:53.446
Yeah, I loved how people felt

08:53.448 --> 08:55.381
they could be open and honest, you know?

08:55.383 --> 08:56.716
Maybe a little too honest,

08:56.718 --> 08:58.622
like that lady that called
me "black Bart Simpson."

09:01.955 --> 09:04.757
Wait a minute, where's my baseball?

09:04.759 --> 09:06.472
I don't know. Maybe you put
it in the back or something.

09:06.496 --> 09:07.496
No.

09:07.595 --> 09:09.597
It's got to be around here
somewhere. Hey, hey, guys.

09:09.622 --> 09:11.197
Help us look for this ball.

09:11.199 --> 09:12.732
- All right.
- Sure.

09:12.734 --> 09:14.634
Maybe it rolled under
the counter or something.

09:14.636 --> 09:16.903
It can't roll anywhere;
it was in a square box.

09:18.461 --> 09:20.825
I think someone stole that baseball.

09:20.975 --> 09:22.975
How? This place was full of cops.

09:22.977 --> 09:25.727
It was also full of
donuts... They got distracted.

09:29.683 --> 09:31.784
Who do you think could have taken it?

09:31.786 --> 09:34.153
I don't know. It was
someone who was admiring it,

09:34.155 --> 09:36.122
someone who was in this general area,

09:36.124 --> 09:38.057
someone who could reach the top shelf

09:38.059 --> 09:40.144
on his tippy-toes.

09:41.529 --> 09:42.728
You talking about Malcolm?

09:42.730 --> 09:43.996
Malcolm, huh?

09:43.998 --> 09:45.097
Franco's got something there.

09:45.122 --> 09:47.133
Man, why you accusing my friend?

09:47.135 --> 09:48.074
It could've been anybody.

09:48.128 --> 09:49.227
It could've been Fawz.

09:49.604 --> 09:50.996
Please.

09:52.373 --> 09:54.240
If I wanted one of your treasures,

09:54.242 --> 09:56.527
it would not be a stupid baseball.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.480
I would take your bobblehead.

10:00.242 --> 10:02.636
His head is too big for
his body. It's like...

10:03.618 --> 10:04.884
Look, all I'm saying,

10:04.886 --> 10:06.475
he was very interested in that baseball,

10:06.500 --> 10:08.854
which makes him a most likely suspect.

10:08.856 --> 10:11.590
So, with no evidence, you
just decided it's Malcolm.

10:11.592 --> 10:13.592
The one young black guy you didn't know.

10:13.594 --> 10:14.660
You think this is about race?

10:14.662 --> 10:16.062
What else could it be about?

10:16.568 --> 10:18.931
Man, you're no better than Officer Li.

10:21.537 --> 10:24.570
Wow. I wonder how long
this has been here.

10:24.572 --> 10:27.106
It's one of those pens
when you turn it upside down

10:27.131 --> 10:28.496
the lady gets naked.

10:30.977 --> 10:34.280
I'm gonna guess this one is from...

10:34.282 --> 10:36.087
yep, the '70s.

10:40.152 --> 10:42.517
So, uh, how much was
that baseball worth?

10:42.542 --> 10:44.276
I paid $600.

10:44.636 --> 10:46.517
You had $600 to blow,

10:46.520 --> 10:49.072
and you couldn't buy
one jar of my creams?

10:51.293 --> 10:52.925
Look in the mirror, man.

10:52.950 --> 10:55.322
You're handsome, but
you could be beautiful.

10:57.432 --> 10:58.999
There he is.

10:59.001 --> 11:00.901
Hey, you're right on time today.

11:00.903 --> 11:03.168
Oh, well, you'd be surprised
how fast your commute can be

11:03.193 --> 11:05.184
when your civil rights
aren't being violated.

11:08.710 --> 11:09.911
You filing a police report?

11:09.936 --> 11:13.948
Yeah, but then we're gonna
hand it over to Officer Li.

11:13.950 --> 11:15.015
He's handling this?

11:15.040 --> 11:17.351
Look, I know you had a bad experience,

11:17.353 --> 11:19.053
but he is not a bad cop.

11:19.055 --> 11:20.454
But why can't you two do it?

11:20.456 --> 11:22.299
Well, because we have to
go to a sexual harassment

11:22.324 --> 11:23.791
seminar this afternoon.

11:23.793 --> 11:27.394
It was a misunderstanding.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.383
I said he had a night stick.

11:31.067 --> 11:32.700
Not a nice...

11:32.702 --> 11:34.196
They get it!

11:34.637 --> 11:38.150
Are you pointing the fingers at
any one suspect in particular?

11:38.175 --> 11:39.441
Oh, I'm not pointing any fingers.

11:39.709 --> 11:40.931
They did ask me if I thought

11:40.956 --> 11:43.944
I might have known who did it,
so I just shared my suspicions.

11:43.946 --> 11:45.112
Well, didn't you hear Randy?

11:45.114 --> 11:46.680
Officer Li's in charge of this now,

11:46.682 --> 11:48.021
and if he goes to question Malcolm,

11:48.046 --> 11:50.059
he ain't leaving till he finds
something to arrest him for,

11:50.084 --> 11:51.020
whether he did it or not.

11:51.045 --> 11:52.333
I'm just presenting the facts.

11:52.358 --> 11:54.139
It's up to the police
to sort it all out.

11:54.190 --> 11:57.057
Great, if you trust the cops
that's doing the sorting.

11:58.293 --> 12:01.613
My, my, so emotional.

12:04.103 --> 12:05.769
Like a girl.

12:06.202 --> 12:07.909
Where's my phone?

12:07.934 --> 12:09.403
I'm sorry, that was wrong.

12:09.405 --> 12:10.804
I should've said like a person

12:10.806 --> 12:12.473
who earns less than a man,

12:12.475 --> 12:14.881
but that's because she will quit
when she's married and pregnant.

12:14.906 --> 12:17.874
Oh! Where is it?!

12:17.899 --> 12:19.366
This is too good.

12:19.391 --> 12:21.499
She will never accuse
a brown guy of stealing.

12:23.187 --> 12:24.554
What's wrong, Maya?

12:24.579 --> 12:26.045
You're sweating like an Italian.

12:31.059 --> 12:33.027
Why is Franco so upset?

12:33.029 --> 12:35.129
I'll-I'll go check on him.

12:35.131 --> 12:36.641
I mean, I wasn't doing
anything wrong, was I?

12:36.666 --> 12:37.977
I just wanted my ball back.

12:38.534 --> 12:40.768
What are the chances you'll find it?

12:40.770 --> 12:43.470
Well, once we solve all the murders,

12:43.472 --> 12:47.441
get drugs off the street,
and negotiate a gang truce,

12:47.443 --> 12:50.518
your missing baseball
will be our top priority.

12:51.847 --> 12:53.971
So if I murder someone, I'll move up?

12:56.651 --> 12:58.452
Yo, James, let me ask you something.

12:58.454 --> 12:59.587
Sure.

12:59.589 --> 13:01.709
But I need you not
to be a cop right now.

13:01.734 --> 13:03.567
Just be a regular dude.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.793
So take off the hat.

13:05.795 --> 13:08.996
Uh, okay, but I'm warning
you, after I take it off,

13:08.998 --> 13:11.231
we only have, like, a
minute before someone sees

13:11.233 --> 13:13.067
the three of us sitting
out here and calls it in.

13:14.503 --> 13:18.105
So, how can you be a black
man in the city and a cop?

13:19.512 --> 13:21.842
Look, Franco, I get it, okay?

13:21.844 --> 13:23.043
Before I was a cop,

13:23.045 --> 13:24.945
I was stopped and frisked all the time.

13:24.947 --> 13:26.023
It pissed me off.

13:26.048 --> 13:27.271
That's why I joined the force.

13:27.296 --> 13:29.710
Thought I could change
things from within.

13:29.735 --> 13:31.538
And I get to show people that black men

13:31.563 --> 13:34.755
are not just criminals or athletes.

13:34.757 --> 13:36.447
Or criminal athletes.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.561
And-and I respect that. I really do.

13:40.563 --> 13:44.410
I just don't understand how you
can work alongside cops like Li.

13:45.168 --> 13:47.134
What do you guys want me to do?

13:47.136 --> 13:49.169
I'm a rookie. I can't make waves.

13:49.171 --> 13:51.505
We have a report of three black males

13:51.507 --> 13:54.074
congregating in front
of Superior Donuts.

13:54.076 --> 13:55.653
I'm one of them.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.145
Well, you know what?

13:59.170 --> 14:01.849
Maybe you can't do anything, but I can.

14:01.851 --> 14:03.864
I'm gonna go warn Malcolm
that Officer Not-So-Friendly

14:03.889 --> 14:05.756
might be paying him a visit.

14:06.872 --> 14:08.856
I remember when Franco used to warn me

14:08.858 --> 14:10.434
the cops were on my tail.

14:10.830 --> 14:12.674
Seems like a lifetime ago.

14:16.431 --> 14:18.932
Just go two blocks
down and make a right.

14:18.934 --> 14:20.801
Best dog park in the city.

14:20.803 --> 14:23.270
Thank you, ma'am. I'll
be sure to check it out.

14:25.874 --> 14:27.941
- Yo, Malcolm.
- Oh, Franco.

14:27.943 --> 14:29.201
Yeah, I can't really talk right now.

14:29.226 --> 14:30.654
Well, just real quick,
real quick, all right?

14:30.679 --> 14:33.847
So, listen, someone stole my
boss's baseball. All right?

14:33.849 --> 14:36.024
And he told the police
that you might've done it.

14:36.049 --> 14:37.384
All right, so, just...

14:37.386 --> 14:39.787
heads up, this guy
named Officer Li might be

14:39.789 --> 14:41.155
rolling through to see you.

14:41.157 --> 14:42.668
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

14:42.693 --> 14:43.769
Thanks for the warning, man.

14:43.794 --> 14:45.363
Anything for a friend.

14:45.388 --> 14:46.652
Whoa.

14:47.730 --> 14:49.329
Is that a baseball in your pocket?

14:49.331 --> 14:52.566
N-No. It's a small grapefruit.

14:54.169 --> 14:55.378
Big kiwi?

14:57.903 --> 14:59.840
Dude, why would you lie to me?

14:59.842 --> 15:01.675
I defended you.

15:03.244 --> 15:05.846
By the way, I'm missing
my latest edition

15:05.848 --> 15:07.346
of Blackhair Magazine.

15:09.285 --> 15:11.244
Don't let me find out you stole it.

15:14.950 --> 15:16.802
I can't believe Malcolm did that.

15:16.827 --> 15:19.993
And the worst part is, now I
got to tell Arthur he was right.

15:19.995 --> 15:22.229
Tell him the fat guy in the vest did it.

15:22.231 --> 15:23.253
What fat guy in a vest?

15:23.278 --> 15:24.245
Exactly.

15:25.468 --> 15:27.000
What's going on, brothers?

15:27.002 --> 15:28.068
What did we do this time?

15:28.070 --> 15:30.170
You're loitering in a high-crime area.

15:30.172 --> 15:31.412
We're just walking.

15:31.437 --> 15:32.940
In front of a boulangerie.

15:32.942 --> 15:34.241
Whatever the hell that is.

15:34.243 --> 15:35.709
Oh, it's a bakery that sells croissants

15:35.711 --> 15:36.631
and these delightful
little sandwiches...

15:36.656 --> 15:38.022
Shut up, Sweatpants.

15:38.514 --> 15:40.614
Look, I have the right to make sure

15:40.616 --> 15:41.741
you're not doing anything illegal.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.397
Now, come on. You know the drill.

15:44.516 --> 15:46.115
Ah, man.

15:47.022 --> 15:48.956
Okay, look, before you frisk
me, I got something to show...

15:48.958 --> 15:50.991
Hey! Don't put your hand in your pocket.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.445
Yeah, man, even I know that.

15:52.470 --> 15:53.617
Uh, excuse him, Officer.

15:53.642 --> 15:55.508
He's been hanging around
a lot of white people.

15:57.032 --> 15:58.899
Ernie Banks.

15:58.924 --> 16:00.798
You know, I just got a
call that this was stolen

16:00.823 --> 16:02.069
from that donut shop.

16:02.071 --> 16:03.070
Isn't that where you work?

16:03.072 --> 16:04.204
Well, yeah, I was trying to tell you.

16:04.206 --> 16:05.205
I-I didn't take it...

16:05.207 --> 16:06.473
Oh, who did?

16:08.452 --> 16:09.443
I can't tell you that.

16:10.412 --> 16:12.053
So, you work in the shop,

16:12.100 --> 16:13.914
the stolen ball is in your possession,

16:13.916 --> 16:16.717
but you expect me to believe
some mystery person stole it?

16:16.719 --> 16:18.252
That does sound pretty sketchy.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.389
This thing must be pretty valuable, huh?

16:22.391 --> 16:24.792
Way I see it, you got two choices here.

16:24.794 --> 16:28.896
Option A, I take you two down
to the station and book you.

16:28.898 --> 16:33.000
Option B, you go your way,
me and Mr. Banks go ours.

16:33.002 --> 16:35.169
I don't mean to speak out of turn,

16:35.171 --> 16:37.971
but I'm going hard "B" on this one.

16:37.973 --> 16:39.807
But you can't do that.

16:39.809 --> 16:41.408
Who are they gonna believe?

16:41.410 --> 16:45.245
An officer of the law or the
guy who stole from his boss?

16:46.314 --> 16:48.820
Stay out of trouble, playa.

16:48.845 --> 16:50.984
- I'm not your brother!
- He said "playa"

16:50.986 --> 16:52.686
Oh. I'm not your... He's gone.

16:56.204 --> 16:58.844
Well, I'm out of the skin care business.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.467
What happened to your face?

17:03.492 --> 17:05.319
Turns out the Moroccan skin oil

17:05.344 --> 17:07.130
was really just medical waste runoff

17:07.155 --> 17:09.450
from a facility in Gary, Indiana.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.084
It's okay. Urgent care
says I'm out of the woods.

17:14.990 --> 17:16.201
Randy, James.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.584
Guess who I just ran into.

17:17.608 --> 17:19.346
Your little frat buddy, Officer Li.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.003
He just frisked me, again.

17:21.298 --> 17:22.651
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.398
And I found Arthur's ball.

17:24.401 --> 17:26.101
- Y-You found my ball?
- Yeah.

17:26.103 --> 17:27.536
Only Li took it from me.

17:27.538 --> 17:28.502
He said I couldn't report it

17:28.528 --> 17:30.405
'cause nobody'd believe me over him.

17:30.407 --> 17:32.841
Ugh. Well, let's get
to the bottom of this.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.410
Officer Li, this is Officer DeLuca.

17:35.412 --> 17:37.672
Requesting assistance
at Superior Donuts.

17:37.697 --> 17:40.064
So, wait-wait, where
did you find my ball?

17:40.484 --> 17:42.084
Man...

17:42.086 --> 17:43.684
Malcolm stole your ball, man.

17:43.709 --> 17:45.842
Ah! So I was right.

17:46.156 --> 17:47.923
See, I'm not a racist.

17:47.925 --> 17:49.645
You got a button on your phone for that?

17:49.993 --> 17:52.928
No. You just so happened to be right.

17:52.930 --> 17:54.362
That doesn't mean you weren't prejudiced

17:54.364 --> 17:55.663
to suspect him in the first place.

17:55.688 --> 17:58.304
Yeah, well, you were prejudiced
to assume that I was racist.

17:58.329 --> 17:59.528
That's bias.

17:59.804 --> 18:01.328
This is all very confusing.

18:01.353 --> 18:04.234
I can't... I can't keep track of it.

18:04.259 --> 18:06.361
I-I wish I had a blackboard.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.806
I mean a whiteboard. No.

18:07.831 --> 18:09.798
I mean some colored markers.

18:09.823 --> 18:12.697
Oh, geez, I'm falling apart over here.

18:13.317 --> 18:15.490
Yeah, well, you were so
quick to call me racist.

18:15.515 --> 18:16.646
Now, that wasn't right.

18:16.671 --> 18:18.717
How do you think I felt
when I told you I got frisked

18:18.771 --> 18:20.310
and you blamed me for wearing a hoodie?

18:20.335 --> 18:22.335
You have no idea what
I deal with out there.

18:22.659 --> 18:24.606
All right. I get it.

18:24.631 --> 18:25.997
- No, you don't.
- I get it.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.522
You don't get it.

18:27.865 --> 18:29.965
Arthur, have you ever had
the talk with your dad?

18:29.967 --> 18:31.133
Which talk?

18:31.135 --> 18:33.754
Birds and the bees or
shiksas are for practice?

18:34.815 --> 18:37.619
Nah. The talk when
you're eight years old,

18:37.644 --> 18:39.040
and your dad sits you down to tell you,

18:39.042 --> 18:40.909
"Hey, cops are there to stop bad guys,

18:40.911 --> 18:42.477
"but sometimes 'cause you're black,

18:42.479 --> 18:44.412
"they're gonna assume
you're the bad guy.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.242
"Or if you're hanging out
with your white friends,

18:46.267 --> 18:48.850
"and they're messing up,
to get the hell out of there

18:48.852 --> 18:50.352
"'cause they might get a night in jail,

18:50.354 --> 18:52.020
but you'll get a lot worse."

18:53.756 --> 18:56.224
Hey, DeLuca, what's going on?

18:56.226 --> 18:58.627
I'll tell you what's going on.

18:58.629 --> 19:00.896
If you ever mess with that kid again,

19:00.898 --> 19:03.309
that is the last thing you
will do in that uniform.

19:03.334 --> 19:04.800
Yeah, you're the kind of jackass

19:04.802 --> 19:06.368
that makes every Chicago cop look bad.

19:06.370 --> 19:07.302
Whoa.

19:07.304 --> 19:10.572
I was recovering his stolen property.

19:10.574 --> 19:12.774
I just wanted to take
it down to the station

19:12.776 --> 19:14.576
to get a photograph for the case file.

19:14.578 --> 19:16.545
All right? Here you go, sir.

19:16.547 --> 19:18.446
Hey, don't "sir" me.

19:18.448 --> 19:19.915
Yeah, you better watch your step,

19:19.917 --> 19:21.983
or I'm gonna have a
conversation with your superior

19:21.985 --> 19:23.521
the next time he comes in here

19:23.546 --> 19:25.887
for his usual strawberry-frosted.

19:30.081 --> 19:31.557
That was really tough,

19:31.590 --> 19:34.863
right up until you got
to strawberry-frosted.

19:35.898 --> 19:38.228
Thanks for having my back. Thank you.

19:38.253 --> 19:39.986
Appreciate that.

19:40.011 --> 19:42.938
And I-I didn't mean
to call you a racist.

19:42.940 --> 19:46.974
Well, I suppose I did suspect
Malcolm because he was black.

19:47.411 --> 19:50.942
And I might've sided
with Li 'cause he's a cop.

19:51.415 --> 19:53.148
And I shouldn't have made that comment

19:53.150 --> 19:55.858
about those lanky gals in the WNBA.

19:57.187 --> 19:59.321
Oh, come on, this unconscious bias stuff

19:59.323 --> 20:01.022
is just getting us all twisted up.

20:01.024 --> 20:02.824
Now, Maya you started this.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.526
How can we get past it?

20:04.528 --> 20:06.862
Oh. Um...

20:06.864 --> 20:10.398
well... here's the thing.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.734
I missed the last week of that class.

20:12.736 --> 20:16.071
I was... I was dating
the T.A., and we broke up,

20:16.073 --> 20:17.711
and it was super awkward.

20:17.736 --> 20:19.741
He had a hard time expressing
himself emotionally,

20:19.743 --> 20:20.942
and I had a hard time...

20:20.944 --> 20:22.035
Maya!

20:22.060 --> 20:23.394
Sorry. Um...

20:23.419 --> 20:26.753
but if I had to guess,
I would say that the fact

20:26.778 --> 20:29.885
that we're talking about these
issues is a good first step

20:29.887 --> 20:33.188
towards understanding the
differences that divide us?

20:33.190 --> 20:34.756
- I'll go for that.
- Okay.

20:34.758 --> 20:36.424
- Sounds right.
- Yeah.

20:36.426 --> 20:37.893
Finally.

20:37.895 --> 20:40.562
You know, I'm actually
glad this happened,

20:40.564 --> 20:42.898
because I think I learned a lot today.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.866
Yeah, I think we all did.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.201
All right. Bring it in.

20:49.437 --> 20:51.206
Gay.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.174
Come on!
