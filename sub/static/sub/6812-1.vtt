CARRIE: Previously on
Unforgettable...

00:03.270 --> 00:06.068
Senator,
you are a potential
assassination target.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.562
We just want
to keep you safe.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.369
Right. We just
want to keep you safe.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.237
We're talking about
a professional assassin.

00:11.310 --> 00:13.107
We don't know
how he delivers the poison,

00:13.180 --> 00:15.899
but we know he does it
under cover of large crowds.

00:23.390 --> 00:24.414
WEBSTER: Are you okay?

00:24.490 --> 00:25.843
I'm feeling a little off.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.581
Carrie, is it possible
you were poisoned?

00:27.660 --> 00:28.957
Where do you
think you're going?

00:29.020 --> 00:30.123
To catch my murderer.

00:30.190 --> 00:32.351
You and me together,
we can solve anything.

00:32.430 --> 00:34.751
We're the only
chance I've got.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.388
I think we've come up
with an antidote.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.596
Wow, that's a big needle.
Yeah.

00:37.670 --> 00:39.262
You may feel worse
before you feel better.

00:39.340 --> 00:42.036
Carrie. I lost you before,
for nine years.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.237
If you're not in it,
it's meaningless.

00:44.310 --> 00:46.278
SALE: August Kincaid,
former CIA.

00:46.340 --> 00:47.773
This is about
a guy with a grudge.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.239
SALE: A very dangerous guy.

00:57.020 --> 00:58.817
I have to know I
did my best for you.

00:58.890 --> 01:00.380
You've always done
your best for me.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.180
Wow.

01:04.390 --> 01:07.154
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Detective Wells.

01:07.230 --> 01:09.221
Well, I'm her boss.
How can I help you?

01:09.300 --> 01:12.633
Nice to meet you.
I'm Eddie Martin.
I'm her husband.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.440
Two behind the forklift
and another two by
the cargo container.

01:23.510 --> 01:24.704
You forgot
the one on the truck.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.270
_Ah. _
No, I'm leavmg hIm for you.

01:26.350 --> 01:27.544
You know...
You don't forget anything.

01:27.620 --> 01:28.609
Exactly.

01:39.260 --> 01:40.420
Four rounds left. You?

01:40.500 --> 01:41.592
Three.

01:50.670 --> 01:51.898
Shit, I'm out.

01:51.970 --> 01:53.176
Same here.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.468
Oh, we're screwed.

02:16.130 --> 02:18.997
CARRIE: "Super-memory cop
saves New York City."

02:19.070 --> 02:21.038
You had a little help,
if I'm not mistaken.

02:21.100 --> 02:24.900
Come on. "Carrie Wells,
Detective Extraordinaire

02:24.970 --> 02:27.131
"for the Major Crimes Unit
of the NYPD..."

02:27.210 --> 02:28.529
It does not say
"extraordinaire."

02:28.610 --> 02:30.202
Well, it should.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.113
"The dazzling
detective can relive,
in vivid detail,

02:33.180 --> 02:35.045
"everything she's
ever experienced

02:35.120 --> 02:37.782
"because she suffers
from a rare condition

02:37.850 --> 02:40.182
"known as highly superior
autobiographical memory."

02:40.260 --> 02:44.424
"Suffers"? I_don't_ suffer.
My memory is a gift. It's...

02:44.490 --> 02:46.890
I'm like a superhero.

02:46.960 --> 02:50.088
"Superhero"?
More like
super-full of yourself.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.990
Look at this.
I've hit the big time, Al.

02:52.070 --> 02:57.098
Right next to a story about
a councilman
busted with a hooker.

02:57.170 --> 02:58.535
No mention of me in there?

02:58.610 --> 02:59.975
Sadly, no. It's all about me.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.405
There's got to be something.
Nothing.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.801
It can't all be about you.
It is.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.575
Knock yourself out,
nothing there.
Let's see.

03:05.650 --> 03:07.117
Yeah, right here.

03:07.180 --> 03:10.616
"Detective Al Burns,
Wells' strapping partner,

03:10.690 --> 03:11.714
"a modern-day Gary Cooper..."

03:11.790 --> 03:12.882
Yeah.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.212
"...is the real secret
behind her success."

03:15.290 --> 03:17.781
It does not say that.

03:17.860 --> 03:20.897
But it does say
that I'm "New York's
most decorated cop,

03:20.960 --> 03:23.360
"boasting a 100% solve rate."
Come on.

03:23.430 --> 03:26.490
And...
Are you ready for this?
You're going to cry.

03:26.570 --> 03:29.835
"One of New York's
most eligible
bachelorettes."

03:29.910 --> 03:31.798
You got some competition,
baby.

03:31.870 --> 03:34.509
It also says, and I quote,

03:34.580 --> 03:37.378
"With the dynamic combination
of brains and beauty,

03:37.450 --> 03:41.978
"it begs the question,
why is the alluring
Wells still single?"

03:42.050 --> 03:43.711
It does not say that.
That's bull...

03:46.890 --> 03:48.517
What kind of a rag is this?

03:48.590 --> 03:51.184
I can tell them
why you're Single.
You're a nightmare.

03:51.260 --> 03:53.091
You'd marry me in
a New York second.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.559
Wedding's gonna
have to wait.

03:54.630 --> 03:57.098
_ Eliot wants us
in his office now.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.489
Okay.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.633
Hey.

04:07.710 --> 04:08.836
Okay,
hey, guys, we gotta talk.

04:08.910 --> 04:10.377
Oh. What kind of
"welcome back" is that?

04:10.450 --> 04:12.247
Especially for
the most eligible

04:12.320 --> 04:13.571
bachelorette in New York.
Aah!

04:13.650 --> 04:15.208
Yeah, yeah,
I read that article...

04:15.280 --> 04:18.386
Don't say another word, Jay.
You'll ruin the surprise.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.285
What surprise?

04:23.690 --> 04:25.021
Oh, man.

04:25.090 --> 04:28.696
I'd like you to
both meet a detective
out of Daytona Beach.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.967
Carrie, I believe you
spent some time there?

04:31.030 --> 04:34.067
Al Burns,
Detective Eddie Martin.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.631
Carrie, there's
no introduction needed

04:36.710 --> 04:39.531
because, apparently,
he's your husband.

04:43.210 --> 04:46.976
I wish I could say
it was good to see you,
but it's not.

04:47.050 --> 04:48.244
Right back at you.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.308
How did you find me?

04:50.390 --> 04:52.358
For a smart girl,
that's a pretty dumb question.

04:52.420 --> 04:54.308
_"New York's
most eligible bachelorette"?

04:54.390 --> 04:55.414
Right.

04:55.490 --> 04:57.958
Last I checked,
you were married to me.

05:00.760 --> 05:01.749
Well...

05:01.830 --> 05:03.627
You look good.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.258
You, too.
Wow!

05:06.000 --> 05:07.035
You're married?

05:07.100 --> 05:10.604
Yes. Sort of. It... Yes.

05:10.670 --> 05:12.900
It's kind of a long story.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.699
Yeah, it is,
and it's complicated.
She's a nightmare.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.509
Told ya.
What?

05:17.580 --> 05:18.877
Well, and as much
as I just can't wait

05:18.950 --> 05:20.417
to hear the whole sordid tale,
I just...

05:20.480 --> 05:22.539
What are you
doing here, Eddie?

05:22.620 --> 05:25.248
I've been tracking
a couple of guys
out of Daytona.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.584
Got a string of dead bodies
to their names.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.582
And that's our problem why?

05:29.660 --> 05:31.059
Four days ago
they got into a van

05:31.130 --> 05:33.052
full of
methylamine and headed north.

05:33.130 --> 05:35.690
I followed them to see
ifI could find their buyers.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.899
But I lost them,
coming out of
the Holland Tunnel.

05:37.970 --> 05:40.097
Your CO signed off on this?

05:40.170 --> 05:42.058
I took some vacation days.

05:42.140 --> 05:45.200
It's kind of,
kind of a personal
mission for me.

05:46.270 --> 05:47.578
Yeah, I can see that.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.403
While I commend you

05:49.480 --> 05:51.300
taking vacation days
and using them for work...

05:51.380 --> 05:54.247
Carrie, Al, you could learn
a thing or two from him.

05:54.320 --> 05:58.313
...Major Crimes
does not condone
Vigilante mi55ions.

05:58.390 --> 06:00.187
I'll leave you two alone
for a moment.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.285
CARRIE:
Thanks, Eliot.

06:05.290 --> 06:07.429
I think he meant
for the two of us
to have a moment.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.649
Oh, I don't care
what he meant.

06:08.730 --> 06:10.368
CARRIE: AI?

06:10.430 --> 06:11.658
It's... It's okay.

06:16.640 --> 06:20.076
Listen, I know that
I broke your heart
leaving the way I did...

06:20.140 --> 06:22.074
What?
...and just walking out...

06:22.140 --> 06:24.677
I know you think
you're God's gift
to every man on the planet

06:24.750 --> 06:26.342
but,
and nothing personal here,

06:26.420 --> 06:29.742
the day you left was
the greatest day of my life.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.378
Oh.

06:31.450 --> 06:34.248
Two alphas in
one relationship?
Wasn't gonna work.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.083
Wasn't going to work, huh?
Mmm-mmm.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.596
But you're still
wearing the necklace.
Never took it off, huh?

06:39.660 --> 06:41.594
Hmm. I think you're
still in love with me.

06:41.660 --> 06:42.888
You never filed
for divorce, did you?

06:42.970 --> 06:46.019
What? You wish.

06:46.100 --> 06:48.193
You know,
but staying married to you
was a great way

06:48.270 --> 06:52.331
to keep all those
women hell-bent on
marriage off my back.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.901
Look, I need your help.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.302
You've driven halfway
across the country,

06:59.380 --> 07:03.043
following these
guys all by yourself.
You suddenly need me. Why?

07:03.120 --> 07:04.815
Well, I knew you were a cop.

07:04.890 --> 07:06.517
And judging by
how insane you were,

07:06.590 --> 07:07.716
probably a pretty good one.

07:08.990 --> 07:10.457
This is personal to you.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.020
Yeah.
Why?

07:12.930 --> 07:14.022
Remember Cody?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.328
Of course.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.622
Damn it, Eddie.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.765
That's my favorite way
of being woken up.

07:21.840 --> 07:25.833
Seriously? You used
my only clean shirt
as a napkin again?

07:25.910 --> 07:27.275
Look at this. It's disgusting.

07:27.340 --> 07:28.602
Wasn't me.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.648
Just wait,
let me get this straight.

07:30.710 --> 07:32.678
So someone
sneaks into the house
in the middle of the night

07:32.750 --> 07:34.547
and eats your nasty pizza

07:34.620 --> 07:37.509
and wipes their
face with my T-shirt
and then just leaves, right?

07:37.590 --> 07:38.716
Don't smile at me.

07:38.790 --> 07:39.779
Actually,
I messed up your shirt...

07:39.860 --> 07:40.884
What are you doing?
No, get...

07:40.960 --> 07:43.155
...because you look
so much hotter in mine.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.629
You're not going to charm
your way out of this.

07:44.690 --> 07:45.827
You wanna bet?
Don't you dare.

07:45.890 --> 07:47.289
Don't you wanna
see my nightstick?

07:47.360 --> 07:50.727
No. No! Get off.

07:50.800 --> 07:51.926
EDDIE: Cody.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.467
Hey, guys.
EDDIE: Hey.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.939
CARRIE: Hi, Cody.
EDDIE: What've you got,
partner?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.194
Come in, sit down.

07:56.270 --> 07:57.407
Yeah, sit down, Cody.

07:57.470 --> 07:59.836
So, I spotted
two suspicious cars

07:59.910 --> 08:02.208
on Wormwood.
And I got their plates.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.747
Oh, good. Good job.

08:03.810 --> 08:06.779
Before you know it,
you're going to
be in a patrol car.

08:06.850 --> 08:08.841
Hey, hey, hey.

08:08.920 --> 08:12.117
Stick to the license plates,
amigo, all right?

08:12.190 --> 08:14.055
Okay.
EDDIE: All right.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.281
He kept coming
around after you left.

08:16.360 --> 08:19.727
Kind of grew up
an unofficial deputy.
He joined the Academy.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.621
I was on the DeMars case.
I think he was trying to help.

08:22.700 --> 08:26.067
Because when they...

08:26.130 --> 08:29.031
When they found Cody's body,

08:29.100 --> 08:31.637
it was near
where one of the DeMars'
mobile labs had been.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.507
I led him right to them.

08:36.810 --> 08:38.641
I'm sorry.

08:42.850 --> 08:44.841
All right.

08:44.920 --> 08:48.310
I'll do it. For Cody.

08:48.390 --> 08:49.755
Okay. What about the other...

08:49.830 --> 08:52.481
I'll rally the troops.
Don't worry about them.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.255
You're married?
No.

08:54.330 --> 08:56.059
No?
Well, technically, yes.

08:56.130 --> 08:59.122
But I was married
for, like, six weeks.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.599
Listen,
when I left Syracuse,

09:00.670 --> 09:02.262
I just needed to get away
from everything.

09:02.340 --> 09:05.059
I went to Daytona
'cause they had
good gambling,

09:05.140 --> 09:07.279
cocktails,
great sunshiny weather.
And...

09:07.340 --> 09:09.274
And you got married.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.501
And I guess it
just slipped your mind

09:11.580 --> 09:13.673
to tell me,
since you've been back.

09:13.750 --> 09:14.978
Nothing slips my mind.

09:15.050 --> 09:16.586
Not a big deal.
Why mention it?

09:16.650 --> 09:19.517
And now he shows up,
and you're gonna help him.

09:19.590 --> 09:23.788
Actually, I was hoping
we were gonna help him.

09:23.860 --> 09:28.092
So, one of my exes walks in,
asking for help.
You're volunteering?

09:28.160 --> 09:29.991
Whatever you did in the past

09:30.070 --> 09:32.937
has no bearing
on what we have
together now.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.992
So, as a mature adult,
I would of
course help your ex.

09:36.070 --> 09:37.662
Oh!

09:37.740 --> 09:40.174
Unless it was Georgia Song.
That one...

09:40.240 --> 09:42.333
I mean, she hit on you
every time we were together,

09:42.410 --> 09:44.640
and then she intentionally
spilled her drink on me.
Mmm-hmm.

09:44.710 --> 09:45.904
And she gave you
that ugly, brown

09:45.980 --> 09:47.117
turtleneck that I
had to throw away.

09:47.180 --> 09:49.319
I looked all over for that.

09:51.390 --> 09:52.948
Yeah, I'm in.
Thank you.

09:53.020 --> 09:55.557
Only to ensure
this clown
doesn't get you killed.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.258
Okay.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.820
And I'm out
if your six kids
show up next.

09:58.890 --> 10:01.723
Six? One, two, three...
No, we're good.

10:08.740 --> 10:12.836
Angus and Malcolm DeMars.
They're brothers.
Seriously bad guys.

10:12.910 --> 10:15.174
A handful of unsolved murders
linked to them.

10:15.640 --> 10:16.846
Mom left.

10:16.910 --> 10:20.038
Rumor was they
killed their father
in a drug dispute.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.884
Rumor was the dispute
was with Angus and Malcolm.

10:22.950 --> 10:24.542
They killed their father
over a meth deal?

10:24.620 --> 10:26.087
Yeah, with a crowbar.

10:26.150 --> 10:27.549
Nice family.

10:27.620 --> 10:30.180
Ex-cons with that
much methylamine,
why didn't you arrest them?

10:30.260 --> 10:32.182
I needed to connect them
with the buyers

10:32.260 --> 10:33.989
to get them off
of the streets for good.

10:34.060 --> 10:37.097
They left Daytona
on Thursday,
so I followed them.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.263
Until you get to the part
where you lost them.

10:39.330 --> 10:41.434
JAY LEE: You got a profile
where they might be staying?

10:41.500 --> 10:44.139
Yeah, based on the motels
they favored on the way up,

10:44.210 --> 10:46.303
they like places that
offer ground floor units,

10:46.370 --> 10:49.134
have minimal surveillance,
and don't ask
a lot of questions.

10:49.210 --> 10:50.905
Anything else
you can give us?

10:50.980 --> 10:52.971
Yeah, they like quick
access to their vehicle.

10:53.050 --> 10:54.608
They always stayed
near the highways.

10:54.680 --> 10:58.889
Occasionally, they'd call in
for female company, and...

10:58.950 --> 11:00.611
And Angus...

11:00.690 --> 11:02.578
Angus loves Highway Hoagie.

11:02.660 --> 11:04.218
So they always stayed
near one of them.

11:04.290 --> 11:06.281
Look at this.
I've hit the big time, Al.

11:06.360 --> 11:10.569
Right next to
a story about a councilman
busted with a hooker.

11:11.930 --> 11:14.069
Hookers and hoagies.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.868
Al, that article
_ that I was
reading to you today.

11:17.940 --> 11:19.498
Haven't we moved on
from your moment of glory?

11:19.570 --> 11:21.231
No, no.
Listen, not that one.

11:21.310 --> 11:23.471
The one about
the councilman
and the hookers.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.246
There was a picture
of him coming out of
a Metro Motor Lodge.

11:26.310 --> 11:29.438
In the background
was a Highway Hoagie.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.680
Jay, look it up for me.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.786
Check for Metro
Motor Lodges nearby

11:32.860 --> 11:35.112
and Highway Hoagies
that are close to them.

11:35.190 --> 11:36.487
Wow.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.721
It's kind of amazing
seeing your memory at work.

11:38.790 --> 11:41.156
Amazing enough
that you're glad
you married me?

11:41.230 --> 11:43.323
Nothing's that amazing.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.526
I got it.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.227
Jersey City,
just off Exit 16.

11:46.300 --> 11:47.892
Let's go.

11:58.610 --> 12:01.738
So,
you two staying married?

12:01.820 --> 12:03.219
You know, I hadn't
really thought about it.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.212
Yeah, me neither.
It's been what, 10 years?

12:05.290 --> 12:07.850
Eleven years, five months,
three weeks, two days.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.321
Now that Eddie's here,
I figured you might
want to disentangle.

12:11.390 --> 12:15.019
Called a buddy in Florida,
had him pull
a couple of strings.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.898
You can have your
marriage disentangled
from right here in New York.

12:17.970 --> 12:19.426
When did you do
all this homework?

12:19.500 --> 12:20.637
Just trying
to help a friend.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.565
Yeah, a friend?

12:22.640 --> 12:23.959
Yeah.

12:31.510 --> 12:32.909
Help you, detectives?

12:32.980 --> 12:35.540
Your powers of deduction
are very impressive.

12:35.620 --> 12:37.679
Yeah, I got a fifth sense
for that kind of stuff.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.388
Sixth.
Uh?

12:39.450 --> 12:41.315
These guys stay
at your motel?

12:41.390 --> 12:42.584
Nope.

12:42.660 --> 12:43.854
Hey, look again.

12:46.830 --> 12:50.027
Angus and Malcolm DeMars.
Seriously bad guys.

12:50.100 --> 12:53.092
A handful of unsolved murders
linked to them.

12:53.170 --> 12:54.762
GRENDEL:
Still doesn't ring a bell.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.400
Excuse me,
where did you find that hat?

12:57.470 --> 12:58.960
Room 113.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.701
The photos you
showed us earlier.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.305
Angus DeMars
was wearing this exact hat.

13:04.310 --> 13:05.402
People checked out.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.313
Must have left this behind.
I just cleaned it up.

13:08.380 --> 13:10.917
This their garbage?

13:10.990 --> 13:13.709
Uh. Tony's All-Star.
You know it?

13:13.790 --> 13:15.951
Tony's is in Sunset Park.

13:16.020 --> 13:18.250
Pizza tastes like cardboard
and it's miles from here.

13:18.330 --> 13:21.049
So why go all
the way to Brooklyn
for crappy pizza?

13:21.130 --> 13:22.893
I know these guys.
They're careful.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.528
They don't leave
anything to chance.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.488
If they're going to do a drop,
they're going
to go in advance,

13:26.570 --> 13:28.765
they're going to
check the streets,
entrances, exits.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.102
A dry run.

13:30.170 --> 13:32.331
Maybe we're not
too late after all.

13:32.410 --> 13:33.934
Maybe.

13:35.610 --> 13:38.841
Oh, come on.
Get a room.
They're cheap.

13:38.910 --> 13:40.138
Come on.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.686
Guys inside don't remember
seeing the dealers.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.022
But I did bring you a slice.

13:52.090 --> 13:53.955
Thank you.

13:54.030 --> 13:55.588
Oh, you're welcome.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.366
Ithought
the pizza was no good.

13:57.430 --> 13:59.421
Oh, it's terrible.
But I figured since
you're in New York,

13:59.500 --> 14:01.593
you may as well try a piece
of Brooklyn's worst.

14:01.670 --> 14:03.535
Did you bring me a napkin?

14:03.610 --> 14:05.601
No, but you could
always use my shirt
like you did back in Daytona.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.376
One time. It was one time.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.078
One time?
Well, actually three.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.698
Great story. What's next?

14:10.780 --> 14:11.974
What do you
think of that place?

14:12.850 --> 14:14.477
AL: Door's wedged open.

14:14.550 --> 14:15.619
Nothing else around here.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.147
EDDIE: Take a look
at those windows.

14:17.220 --> 14:19.518
Looks like someone
was on the InSIde,
looking out.

14:19.590 --> 14:20.579
Let's check it out.

14:25.090 --> 14:26.682
EDDIE: That's their van.

14:51.490 --> 14:53.788
Meet the DeMars brothers.

14:53.860 --> 14:56.283
Looks like
someone got to them
before you did.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.759
Now what?

15:03.700 --> 15:05.964
We were following a lead.
We don't need to
call Narcotics.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.691
Yeah, I know you
Major Crimes,
you got your own rulebook.

15:07.770 --> 15:10.500
This is my case.
I followed
these guys for days.

15:10.570 --> 15:12.299
Listen up, Detective,

15:12.370 --> 15:13.598
you gonna work
_ a narcotics case
in Brooklyn South,

15:13.680 --> 15:15.238
I expect to be looped in.
EDDIE: Sartain.

15:15.310 --> 15:17.778
That's Lieutenant Sartain,
and you're out of line.

15:17.850 --> 15:18.976
Memory freak show.

15:19.050 --> 15:20.119
CARRIE: What'd you call me?

15:20.180 --> 15:21.579
What did you call me?
It is so nice

15:24.690 --> 15:28.717
Listen,
I'm only going
to say this once.

15:28.790 --> 15:30.678
Yes, we broke protocol,

15:30.760 --> 15:33.558
but I personally ordered
my detectives to
look at this case.

15:33.630 --> 15:35.621
We were already working
with Daytona PD.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.998
I didn't want to involve
any other agenCIes

15:38.070 --> 15:40.129
until there was something
to involve them with.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.862
Now, clearly there is.
So, moving forward,

15:42.940 --> 15:45.033
I'm more than happy
to keep you in the loop.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.429
Not a problem.

15:51.380 --> 15:53.245
Thank you, Eliot.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.743
You three have
some explaining to do.

15:55.820 --> 15:58.914
I specifically said
this was not
a Major Crimes case.

15:58.990 --> 16:00.548
Well,
you know I have a problem
with authority.

16:00.620 --> 16:01.689
And commitment too,
by the way.

16:01.760 --> 16:02.749
Sure, right?

16:02.820 --> 16:04.287
I do not have a problem
with commitment.

16:04.360 --> 16:06.658
I just haven't
met the right guy.

16:06.730 --> 16:09.551
Whoa. Okay, stop.
Just stop talking.

16:09.630 --> 16:13.361
The point is, this is now
a Major Crimes case.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.533
Don't screw it up.

16:16.970 --> 16:18.437
Delson here.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.113
Carrie Wells.

16:29.180 --> 16:31.148
Yeah.
Great photo today.

16:31.220 --> 16:33.518
You actually look the same
as you do in The Post.

16:33.590 --> 16:35.615
Me? Oh, my God.
I can't take
a good picture.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.021
I'm barely recognizable.

16:37.090 --> 16:38.352
I'm so sorry, who are you?

16:38.430 --> 16:39.886
I'm Delina Michaels,
the new ME.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.552
The new ME?
Yeah.

16:41.630 --> 16:43.120
I would shake
your hand, but...

16:43.200 --> 16:44.667
Yeah, no, that's okay.

16:44.730 --> 16:47.460
What happened to the old ME?
Where's Jo?

16:47.540 --> 16:49.599
Oh! You didn't hear?
Dr. Webster passed.

16:49.670 --> 16:51.103
Passed away

16:51.170 --> 16:54.537
No, her certification exam.
To the Cordon
Bleu culinary school.

16:54.610 --> 16:56.168
Oh!
But she did
leave you something.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.707
Hold on,
I got it right here.

16:57.780 --> 16:59.543
Okay.
Here it is.

16:59.610 --> 17:00.941
"To Carrie."

17:01.020 --> 17:02.248
Thank you.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.947
Now look,
I know Joanne Webster

17:04.020 --> 17:05.544
was your friend,
your confidant,

17:05.620 --> 17:07.156
and the world's best
medical examiner.

17:07.220 --> 17:10.121
And even though
the word is you can be
a bit standoffish...

17:10.190 --> 17:11.589
That's the word, is it?

17:11.660 --> 17:13.355
Yeah, but who cares?
I have the same quality,

17:13.430 --> 17:14.658
and I know
you're gonna like me.

17:14.730 --> 17:16.652
All right.
Well, I will definitely

17:16.730 --> 17:18.595
take your word
for that, Delina.

17:18.670 --> 17:19.967
Uh, DeMars brothers.

17:20.030 --> 17:21.292
Yes, the DeMars brothers.

17:21.370 --> 17:23.167
So, these are Malcolm's lungs.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.901
Now,
I noticed a discoloration

17:24.970 --> 17:26.562
in the gums,
so I checked the lungs.

17:26.640 --> 17:29.279
There's burning of the tissue
in the alveolus.

17:29.340 --> 17:32.309
Okay.
And what about this bruising?

17:32.380 --> 17:35.474
Yep, hematomas
on both sides of the
cheek and the jaw.

17:35.550 --> 17:37.381
CARRIE: And both of them
have it?

17:37.450 --> 17:39.247
DELINA: Yeah,
but I haven't figured out
the cause yet.

17:39.320 --> 17:42.084
There were both
shot close range,
center forehead.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.128
Hmm. Maybe a mob hit?

17:44.190 --> 17:45.589
Could be.

17:45.660 --> 17:46.957
Hey, um...

17:47.830 --> 17:49.650
I just... I gotta ask.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.559
How long does that take?

17:51.630 --> 17:52.619
These?

17:52.700 --> 17:54.338
Yeah.
Hmm.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.163
Depends how many
drinks I've had.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.468
I could show you how.

17:57.540 --> 18:00.179
Yeah,
I might take you up on that.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.935
Girls' night out?
Why not?

18:02.010 --> 18:03.546
All right.
All right.

18:03.610 --> 18:06.408
Jay.
Hey, call Organized Crime.

18:06.480 --> 18:09.244
Get your buddy Jerry Marsden
over here.

18:11.750 --> 18:12.739
Oh!

18:17.330 --> 18:19.321
Come on.
Hey, come on. Coffee.

18:22.360 --> 18:23.497
Come on.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.360
That's not how that goes.

18:26.430 --> 18:28.364
Okay, that's not
Jerry Marsden.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.307
Let's get him
before he kills
the coffeemaker.

18:31.370 --> 18:33.008
Hey. Come on.

18:34.810 --> 18:36.778
Excuse me, who are you?

18:36.840 --> 18:37.909
Hey, hey, I'm Denny.

18:39.080 --> 18:40.843
Organized Crime.
Call me Denny.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.649
Where's Jerry Marsden?

18:42.720 --> 18:46.986
Oh, yeah,
he retired last month.
Guy's a legend.

18:47.050 --> 18:50.451
Okay,
Jay Lee, this is A! Burns.
Let me introduce you to...

18:50.530 --> 18:51.883
Carrie Wells. Wow.

18:53.660 --> 18:55.196
Wow, um...

18:55.260 --> 18:57.125
I'm a huge fan.
Oh!

18:57.200 --> 18:58.622
The way you solved that case,

18:58.700 --> 19:00.861
you know, when the Brady guy
took over the slqscraper.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.589
And you know,
when that lady
was going to shoot.

19:02.670 --> 19:03.898
You know, the peace doctor.
I remember.

19:03.970 --> 19:07.201
Yeah, it's always
nice to meet a fan.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.736
Hey, listen,
I hear you do this thing

19:08.810 --> 19:10.346
where, like, you know,
someone gives you a date

19:10.410 --> 19:11.672
and then,
like, you can tell them

19:11.750 --> 19:13.638
everything that happened
on that date.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.017
So my birthday's
December 6th, 1985.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.274
So what I'm
trying to say is...

19:16.350 --> 19:17.749
I'm not going to do that.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.344
Come on, Carrie,
show him your gift.
I'm really...

19:19.420 --> 19:21.718
I'm not going to do that.
No?

19:21.790 --> 19:23.929
All right,
shall we get to work?
Mmm-hmm.

19:23.990 --> 19:26.288
Wow! Okay, yeah, sure.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.920
All right, so these are guys
who would all have an interest

19:29.000 --> 19:30.865
in outsiders bringing meth
into New York.

19:30.930 --> 19:32.261
Paulie Fitzgerald?

19:32.330 --> 19:33.797
I put that guy away
a couple years back.

19:33.870 --> 19:35.531
Prison overcrowding,
he's out, Al.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.830
I don't_see him _
as an execution-style killer.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.128
DENNY: Yeah,
so who's our
prom king over there?

19:42.110 --> 19:44.874
Yeah, that's Vlad Nostrov.
Hey, I've had the pleasure.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.099
Jay-bone.

19:46.180 --> 19:48.375
Uh, it's just Jay, man.
All right.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.708
That guy's a mobster?

19:50.790 --> 19:52.883
Hey, hey.
Don't let his
baby face fool you.

19:52.950 --> 19:54.884
Guy's a killer.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.052
Before he takes you out,
he makes you look
right up at him...

19:56.120 --> 19:57.485
I mean like,
makes you, you know?

19:57.560 --> 19:59.687
Then he kills you.
Guy's a psycho.

19:59.760 --> 20:02.490
Hematomas on both sides
of the cheek and the jaw.

20:02.560 --> 20:05.267
And they both have it, uh?

20:05.330 --> 20:07.389
He grabs their faces.

20:07.470 --> 20:09.961
Which could leave bruising
on their jaws, right?

20:10.040 --> 20:11.860
Sure.
Okay,

20:11.940 --> 20:14.636
both of the DeMars brothers
had bruising on
their jaws consistent

20:14.710 --> 20:17.543
with someone grabbing
their face just like that.

20:17.610 --> 20:20.249
Let's go pay
your friend, Vlad, a visit.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.469
Hmm.

20:21.550 --> 20:23.108
And I'll loop Narcotics in.

20:30.060 --> 20:32.426
AL: What the hell
is Narcotics doing here?

20:32.490 --> 20:33.855
Get down!

20:38.300 --> 20:39.790
What the hell are
they d0ing here?
This is our case.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.132
They're hogging the glory.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.205
We go on three.

20:45.270 --> 20:46.532
Wait, whoa...

20:46.610 --> 20:48.601
You don't want to evaluate
the Situation real qUIck?

20:50.310 --> 20:52.346
I just did.

20:52.410 --> 20:53.775
You know how to
fire that thing?

20:53.850 --> 20:55.169
All right.

20:59.820 --> 21:01.515
Nice. Push.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.368
Oh, God, you are so badass.

21:10.430 --> 21:11.761
I'm going to Sartain,
cover me.

21:11.830 --> 21:13.161
EDDIE: All right, gotcha.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.845
What happened to cooperation?

21:27.920 --> 21:30.070
Vlad's guys were on the move.
I had to make the call.

21:30.150 --> 21:31.583
The call you had
to make was to us.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.867
That's Vlad.

22:06.650 --> 22:07.651
Wow.

22:09.990 --> 22:11.878
Hey, way to go, Al.
You saved her husband's life.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.222
Don't remind me.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.520
I thought we were
working together.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.056
Couldn't wait, Detective.

22:17.130 --> 22:18.927
You're an asshole,
you know that?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.661
And this?

22:20.740 --> 22:22.469
CZ Phantom.

22:22.540 --> 22:24.861
Same kind of gun
that killed
the DeMars brothers.

22:26.510 --> 22:28.808
Sartain saves the day, huh?

22:41.060 --> 22:42.049
Oh, this is nice.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.819
Hey, Jay to the Izzle.

22:44.890 --> 22:45.925
What's up, bro?
What you doing?

22:45.990 --> 22:47.082
Another nickname.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.718
You hear about
that shootout with

22:48.800 --> 22:50.119
Vlad and his boys, right?
Little...

22:50.200 --> 22:51.599
I heard you did
all right out there.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.695
Well, you know,
that's what I do. Yeah.

22:53.770 --> 22:55.590
Hey, what about you?
What are you doing?
What is all this?

22:55.670 --> 22:58.366
Well,
I'm running Vlad's people
against the DeMars brothers.

22:58.440 --> 22:59.839
Maybe,
you know, there's a link.

22:59.910 --> 23:01.639
Okay. Look,
listen, about Carrie.

23:01.710 --> 23:05.441
And that hot new ME running
around here, what, Delina?
Right?

23:07.950 --> 23:10.373
Right?

23:10.450 --> 23:12.418
Okay, you do realism
there's no actual
thought there, right?

23:12.490 --> 23:14.014
Yeah.
Okay.

23:14.090 --> 23:15.614
I'm just saying,
the both of them.

23:15.690 --> 23:17.214
Hot. Hot stuff.

23:17.290 --> 23:18.826
Agreed. Dibs on Delina.

23:18.890 --> 23:20.790
Dibs

23:20.860 --> 23:24.261
Hot detective,
hot new ME, you know?

23:24.330 --> 23:25.627
What, you never thought
about a threesome

23:25.700 --> 23:27.099
with that
technical head of yours?

23:27.170 --> 23:28.432
No, dude, come on.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.036
What, is it too much?
Come on.

23:30.100 --> 23:31.362
Yeah, definitely too much.

23:31.440 --> 23:32.634
Sorry, dude.

23:32.710 --> 23:34.598
What's going on?
Uh...

23:34.680 --> 23:35.806
Been trying to
find a connection

23:35.880 --> 23:37.677
between the DeMars brothers
and Vlad and his people.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.310
So far no cell records,
no wire transfers, nothing.

23:40.380 --> 23:43.269
I gotta go talk to somebody.
I could use some backup.

23:43.350 --> 23:45.409
I'll go with you.

23:45.490 --> 23:47.958
No, you keep looking
into Vlad and his people.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.055
Sure.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.782
You, Mr. Threesome.
Come with me.

23:51.860 --> 23:54.124
All right, hey, look.
To be continued,
all right, bud?

23:54.200 --> 23:55.497
Where we going?

23:56.760 --> 23:58.523
I tell you, man,
I envy you.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.296
Getting to work
with Carrie Wells
every day.

24:01.370 --> 24:03.509
You guys were partners
back in the 117
in Queens, right?

24:03.570 --> 24:04.969
Syracuse actually.
It's complicated.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.667
Oh, yeah, I bet.

24:06.740 --> 24:08.674
Especially now
with her husband around,
huh?

24:08.740 --> 24:10.139
Did you know him
back in the day, too?

24:10.210 --> 24:11.643
You always ask
these many questions?

24:11.710 --> 24:13.541
You know,
I like to pride myself
on my curiosity, sure.

24:13.620 --> 24:16.248
Start priding yourself
on minding your own business.
Oh-ho.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.413
Guy's got
a little fight in him.
I like that.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.219
I see why you and Carrie,
you know?
Quiet.

24:20.290 --> 24:21.780
Whatever happens, be cool.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.316
Hey.

24:23.390 --> 24:25.187
Wait, who we looking for?
Quiet.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.719
MAN: Hey, man, give me some.

24:36.900 --> 24:38.037
Get your own stash.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.044
AL: Ah...

24:44.110 --> 24:45.247
Austin.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.678
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:55.390 --> 24:56.709
Ahhh.

24:56.790 --> 24:58.587
Now, why'd you have
to get all friendly, Austin?

24:58.660 --> 25:02.653
You bastard, Al.
Why'd you punch me so hard?

25:02.730 --> 25:05.597
Had to sell it
for the crackheads, uh?

25:05.670 --> 25:07.399
Thought you'd appreciate it.

25:07.470 --> 25:09.097
Hey, what
the hell's going on here?

25:09.170 --> 25:11.035
Denny Padilla,
meet Austin Caswell,

25:11.110 --> 25:13.203
Detective second grade,
Queens Narcotics.

25:13.270 --> 25:15.374
Denny here likes to ask
a lot of questions.

25:15.440 --> 25:17.101
Ah. Son of a bitch.

25:17.180 --> 25:18.374
What's on your mind?

25:18.450 --> 25:20.873
Five barrels of methylamine
went missing

25:20.950 --> 25:23.214
right before Vlad was killed.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.508
You hear anything?

25:24.590 --> 25:25.739
No. And I won't.

25:25.820 --> 25:28.288
No way Vlad's
buying methylamine
right now.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.112
Why's that?
Doesn't need to.

25:30.190 --> 25:31.828
There's more out there
then there are buyers.

25:31.890 --> 25:34.120
So why take out two couriers
just to get his hands on it?

25:34.200 --> 25:36.156
Something's not right.

25:36.230 --> 25:38.698
Cooks are overstocked
up and down the East Coast.

25:38.770 --> 25:42.797
Believe me,
Vlad's not burning anyone
over methylamine these days.

25:46.470 --> 25:48.506
DeMar_s brothers _
weren't carrying methylamine.

25:48.580 --> 25:49.774
It was something else.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.546
But meth was all
those boys knew.

25:51.610 --> 25:53.271
They may have thought
they were carrying it.

25:53.350 --> 25:55.147
Delina said there were burns
on the lungs

25:55.220 --> 25:56.915
of both Angus
and Malcolm DeMars.

25:56.980 --> 25:58.584
Methylamine wouldn't do that.

25:58.650 --> 25:59.981
What would?

26:00.050 --> 26:01.586
Well, there are
four possible chemicals.

26:01.660 --> 26:04.288
Calcium hydroxide,
sodium hypochlorite,

26:04.360 --> 26:06.624
coactive resinase
and dimethyl sulphate.

26:06.690 --> 26:07.918
All of them are pretty nasty.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.150
Some of them can
burn through flesh, metal.

26:10.230 --> 26:12.494
One can even
burn through glass.

26:12.570 --> 26:14.595
Yeah, I know you Major Crimes,
you got your own rulebook.

26:14.670 --> 26:16.535
I expect to be...
This is my case.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.659
_ That's_
Lieutenant Sartain to you,
and you're out of line.

26:18.740 --> 26:20.469
Memory freak show.

26:20.540 --> 26:23.304
You know,
I saw a glass bottle
at the warehouse.

26:23.380 --> 26:25.041
It was melted.

26:25.110 --> 26:26.702
Which one of those
burns through glass?

26:28.720 --> 26:30.642
Uh... That would be
coactive resmase.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.689
It's a kind of
synthetic enforcer
used in the production of...

26:33.760 --> 26:36.752
Holy crap.
Agreed.

26:36.820 --> 26:39.152
Apparently, the Army's
been all over this stuff.

26:39.230 --> 26:41.050
Early tests show
it can create plastic

26:41.130 --> 26:43.098
strong enough to form
the casings for missiles.

26:43.160 --> 26:46.891
And a plastic missile
would be
undetectable by radar.

26:46.970 --> 26:48.369
And apparently
a bunch of resinase

26:48.440 --> 26:49.862
went missing
a couple weeks ago

26:49.940 --> 26:51.828
from this plant
in Silver Springs,
Florida, which is...

26:51.910 --> 26:53.730
Twenty miles
outside of Daytona.

26:53.810 --> 26:56.028
So whoever hired
the DeMars brothers
used them as mules

26:56.110 --> 26:59.307
because they knew
how to navigate the
back roads and avoid cops.

26:59.380 --> 27:01.473
Must have told them
they were
carrying methylamine,

27:01.550 --> 27:02.972
sent them to New York.

27:03.050 --> 27:04.381
And then when they got here,
they killed them.

27:04.450 --> 27:05.542
Hey, guys, check this.

27:05.620 --> 27:07.315
It's an army video
of a plastic missile

27:07.390 --> 27:08.948
produced with
coactive resinase.

27:09.020 --> 27:10.851
The other two,
encased with metal.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.852
They get shot
down by antiaircraft.

27:12.930 --> 27:15.091
The plastic missile goes on
to hit its target.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.799
Whoever kills
_ th_e DeMars brothe_rs_
is trying to make a missHe

27:17.870 --> 27:19.098
and is still in New York.

27:19.170 --> 27:20.899
And all we've got
to do is find them

27:20.970 --> 27:23.165
in a city of
nine million people.

27:29.810 --> 27:32.802
Hey, QUYS,
I got the results on the
bottle from the crime scene.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.610
Delina says that
there are definitely
traces of coactive resinase,

27:35.680 --> 27:37.147
but here's the thing.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.017
Coactive resinase on its own
isn't strong enough.

27:39.090 --> 27:40.887
It needs something else
to weaponise it.

27:40.960 --> 27:41.984
What?

27:42.060 --> 27:44.051
Copolymer transethermite.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.280
Wait, you're going
to have to help me out.
I failed science.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.657
Failed history and PE, too.

27:47.730 --> 27:49.823
Who fails PE?

27:49.900 --> 27:52.027
Okay, so copolymer's
all around us.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.965
Shower curtains,
toilet seats.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.167
So these guys have
no problem getting
their hands on some.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.867
But they need
a large amount to mix

27:57.940 --> 27:59.498
with all that
coactive resmase,

27:59.570 --> 28:03.108
which is why Jay
was looking for
any unusually large shipments.

28:03.180 --> 28:05.045
So, I pulled up
the security footage

28:05.110 --> 28:06.805
_ from the four_ stores
in the surrounding area,

28:06.880 --> 28:08.939
all reporting large sales
of copolymer.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.885
Our guys are
analyzing all the buyers.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.315
We're trying to match
with facial recognition.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.727
Now that Eddie's here,
I figured you might
want to disentangle.

28:19.460 --> 28:21.018
Called a buddy.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.318
You can have your marriage
disentangled right
here in New York.

28:23.400 --> 28:25.129
When did you do
all this homework?

28:25.200 --> 28:26.565
EDDIE: Just trying
to help a friend.

28:29.140 --> 28:32.769
Wait a second.
I saw that guy
driving by the motel.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.137
And I saw him
somewhere else, too.

28:36.710 --> 28:39.008
But I did bring
you a piece of pizza.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.274
Thank you.

28:40.350 --> 28:41.749
But I figured
since you're in New York,

28:41.820 --> 28:43.674
you might as well try
some of Brooklyn's worst.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.122
Outside the pizza place.

28:51.190 --> 28:53.181
He's been tailing us.

28:53.260 --> 28:56.149
Got a hit on the time
and date when he left
the plastic store.

28:56.230 --> 28:58.164
Here we go.
His name is David Lushing.

28:58.230 --> 29:01.131
Runs a place over in Bushwick
called Real Plastics.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.907
Uh. Normal order for this guy
is a couple kilos a month.

29:03.970 --> 29:05.369
Last week, 40 kilos.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.305
How big a missile
are we talking about?

29:07.370 --> 29:10.168
Big enough to give
the Manhattan
skyline a facelift.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.673
Let's get over to Bushwick.

29:16.680 --> 29:17.886
SAUL: I have nothing to hide.

29:17.950 --> 29:19.941
We fixed our
safety Violations,

29:20.020 --> 29:21.988
and if this is
an immigration thing,

29:22.060 --> 29:23.755
I have papers on
all my employees.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.252
We look like immigration?

29:25.330 --> 29:27.286
Is there a part
of the building
that's secure

29:27.360 --> 29:28.918
that even you're not allowed
to go into?

29:29.730 --> 29:31.459
Yeah, the basement.

29:31.530 --> 29:34.328
The property manager said
that they rented it out,

29:34.400 --> 29:35.537
but I never seen them.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.261
Only Lushing
goes down there.

29:47.450 --> 29:49.645
These are molds
for warheads.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.017
Still warm.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.148
JAY LEE: Hey, AI.

29:52.220 --> 29:53.244
Jay, we just missed him.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.355
They knew we were coming.

29:54.420 --> 29:55.455
How is that possible?

29:55.520 --> 29:56.657
Who else knew?

29:56.720 --> 29:59.518
Well, Eliot was keeping
Narcotics looped in.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.729
You gonna work
_ a narcotics case
in Brooklyn South,

30:01.800 --> 30:03.119
I expect to be looped in.
CARRIE: Sartain.

30:08.300 --> 30:09.369
Wait a second.

30:16.710 --> 30:18.598
Jay, check the ballistics
on Vlad's gun.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.409
How many bullets were left
in the clip?

30:22.620 --> 30:23.917
Got it. Four, Carrie.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.345
Vlad's gun was out of bullets
when he was shot.

30:26.420 --> 30:27.785
I heard it.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.952
Same kind of gun
that killed
the DeMars brothers.

30:33.030 --> 30:34.918
CZ Phantom.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.319
Sartain switched the guns.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.890
Sartain

30:37.970 --> 30:39.392
Yeah.

30:39.470 --> 30:40.994
He killed the
DeMars brothers?

30:41.070 --> 30:42.890
Yeah. But why?

30:42.970 --> 30:44.767
Hey, Carrie,
I'm on with Brooklyn South.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.865
Sartain took off
two hours ago
and never came back.

30:46.940 --> 30:47.975
He's gone.

30:48.780 --> 30:50.179
And so is the missile.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.238
There's no way
that Sartain could connect

30:58.320 --> 30:59.947
with the DeMars
brothers on his own.

31:00.020 --> 31:03.148
You're absolutely right.
They're being
bankrolled big-time.

31:03.220 --> 31:06.189
Several hundred
thousand dollars _
were dep05ited electronically

31:06.260 --> 31:08.228
into his bank account
from a fronting bank in Dubai.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.619
What do we have on Lushing,

31:09.700 --> 31:10.962
the guy who was trailing
Eddie and Carrie

31:11.030 --> 31:12.463
and bought the copolymer?

31:12.530 --> 31:14.839
Well, David Lushing served
in the Army Rangers.

31:14.900 --> 31:16.697
Guess who was
in his battalion?

31:16.770 --> 31:18.863
Lieutenant Greg Sartain.

31:18.940 --> 31:20.703
They took down
one of Saddam's
palaces together.

31:22.010 --> 31:23.830
How do you go from war hero
to terrorist?

31:23.910 --> 31:25.548
Well, Sartain and Lushing
were suspected

31:25.610 --> 31:27.942
of trying to make off
with some of
Saddam's gold reserves.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.113
Lushing took the bullet,
got a dishonorable discharge.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.545
Sartain became a cop.

31:31.620 --> 31:32.814
Now, according to Homeland,

31:32.890 --> 31:34.448
Lushing got
picked up two years ago

31:34.520 --> 31:36.556
for smuggling weapons
to a bunch of
Pakistani warlords.

31:36.620 --> 31:38.429
Did six months in a prison
in Islamabad.

31:38.490 --> 31:41.197
We got security footage
from around
the plastics company.

31:41.260 --> 31:43.490
A black van was headed away
from Real Plastics

31:43.560 --> 31:46.222
seven minutes
before you guys got there.

31:46.300 --> 31:48.495
None of the other factories
claim it as their own.

31:48.570 --> 31:50.492
We got a BOLO out.
AL: Good.

31:50.570 --> 31:52.458
Homeland intercept
any communications

31:52.540 --> 31:55.031
about shipping weapons
out of New York?
Anything like that?

31:55.110 --> 31:57.101
Yeah, they're thinking
it's probably a local target.

31:57.180 --> 31:58.807
They're checking
domestic chatter.

31:59.580 --> 32:01.719
There's some peace summit.

32:01.780 --> 32:03.247
Midtown.
I saw it on the news.

32:03.320 --> 32:04.617
Jay, check it out.

32:06.590 --> 32:08.251
Whoa, guys,

32:08.320 --> 32:10.356
we're talking about
the South Asian _
Cooperation Summit.

32:10.420 --> 32:11.978
The Prime Ministers
of India and Pakistan

32:12.060 --> 32:13.652
are meeting at the Omni Hotel.

32:13.730 --> 32:16.255
Tell Homeland to
go the Omni on 47th.

32:16.330 --> 32:17.490
Hey, hey, guys, guys.

32:17.560 --> 32:20.620
Hold on, I got a hit
on Sartain's personal car.

32:20.700 --> 32:21.997
He just blew by
a traffic cam

32:22.070 --> 32:23.867
coming off the Hutch,
near Westchester Airport.

32:23.940 --> 32:25.498
There's a second
male in the car.

32:25.570 --> 32:27.504
Looks like he's traveling
with his war buddy, Lushing.

32:27.570 --> 32:29.538
Skipping town
before the fireworks.

32:29.610 --> 32:31.578
Go with Homeland,
find that van,

32:34.350 --> 32:35.419
Roger that.

32:44.060 --> 32:45.721
Hey, QUYS,
we got something.

32:45.790 --> 32:48.497
Two men with luggage
matching Sartain and
Lushing's descriptions

32:48.560 --> 32:50.926
just got on
an airport shuttle
from long-term parking.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.798
They're carrying
really heavy bags,
so it could be the missile.

32:53.870 --> 32:55.997
Shuttle dropped them off
at the King West terminal

32:56.070 --> 32:57.935
so you'd better hurry.
AL: I'm on it, Jay.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.898
Denny,
they spotted that black van

32:59.970 --> 33:01.779
half a block
from the Omni Hotel.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.478
DENNY: Stand by.

33:03.540 --> 33:04.609
Coming up on it now.

33:05.650 --> 33:06.674
Got it.

33:21.560 --> 33:22.549
Open up.

33:25.570 --> 33:26.559
OFFICER: Clear.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.960
Jay,
the van is empty, brother.
It's a decoy.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.505
Carrie, Al.
Denny secured the van.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.229
It's empty.
There's no missile.

33:36.310 --> 33:37.800
AL: All right.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.575
Pulling up at King West now.

33:40.450 --> 33:42.111
Place looks completely closed.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.579
I don't get it.
Why get off at
an empty terminal?

33:50.160 --> 33:52.219
I told you.
It's just construction.

33:58.700 --> 34:01.339
Jay, what have
you got on Runway 9?

34:04.740 --> 34:06.207
Oh, man.

34:06.270 --> 34:08.204
Oh, man, what?

34:08.280 --> 34:10.032
I just checked all
the arrivals, Al.

34:10.110 --> 34:11.668
And one of the planes

34:11.750 --> 34:13.706
is the Deputy Prime Minister
of Pakistan's private jet.

34:13.780 --> 34:15.611
He's the last guy arriving
for that conference.

34:15.680 --> 34:18.114
Al, that plane is landing
in four minutes.

34:20.450 --> 34:22.714
Sartain and Lushing
aren't trying to get out
of the country.

34:22.790 --> 34:24.519
They're going to
shoot that plane
out of the slq.

34:25.530 --> 34:26.758
Take cover!

34:39.940 --> 34:41.476
That's the guy
that's been tailing me.

34:41.540 --> 34:43.599
You sure have
a lot of guys after you
these days.

34:44.510 --> 34:45.772
Now there's one less.

34:54.590 --> 34:57.081
Two behind the forklift
and another two by
the cargo container.

34:57.160 --> 34:58.229
You forgot
the one on the truck.

34:58.290 --> 34:59.780
Ah! No, I'm leaving him
for you.

34:59.860 --> 35:01.054
You know...
You don't forget anything.

35:01.130 --> 35:02.119
Exactly.

35:12.710 --> 35:13.904
Four rounds left. You?

35:13.970 --> 35:15.107
Three.

35:24.050 --> 35:25.142
Shit, I'm out.

35:25.220 --> 35:26.539
Same here.

35:26.620 --> 35:28.042
Hope
I'm not interrupting.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.656
As a matter _of fact...
I come bearing gifts.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.756
There's the plane.
We gotta move.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.183
Go, go, go. I got this.

36:19.610 --> 36:20.702
Yes!

36:22.710 --> 36:23.870
We did it.

36:23.940 --> 36:25.544
Way to go, partner.

36:25.610 --> 36:26.645
Way to go.

36:26.710 --> 36:27.847
She was talking to me.

36:27.910 --> 36:29.013
No, she was talking to me.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.548
She was
definitely talking to me.

36:31.620 --> 36:33.019
Thanks for having my back.

36:34.050 --> 36:35.312
Aw!

36:54.710 --> 36:56.678
Excuse me.
Oh! Hi, Mr. Delson.

36:56.740 --> 36:58.742
Oh, please. Eliot's fine.

36:58.810 --> 37:02.917
I just wanted to
make sure that you were
settling in all right?

37:02.980 --> 37:04.584
Yeah,
everyone's been great.

37:04.650 --> 37:06.083
I'm glad
we were able to
solve the case.

37:06.150 --> 37:08.857
Yes. Yes. Excellent work.

37:08.920 --> 37:10.012
Was there something else?

37:10.090 --> 37:11.159
There is.

37:11.220 --> 37:13.427
I was in here earlier,

37:13.490 --> 37:15.253
and I couldn't help but notice

37:15.330 --> 37:18.891
that you had
a bottle of
nail polish remover

37:18.970 --> 37:20.665
near where
the bodies were
being autopSIed,

37:20.730 --> 37:22.493
and then I_ saw
a curling iron

37:22.570 --> 37:25.960
and I thought maybe
this is a good time to
talk about protocol.

37:26.040 --> 37:28.270
Wait. Wait.

37:28.340 --> 37:31.707
You think I'd use
this on my nails?

37:31.780 --> 37:34.203
Well,
it is nail polish remover.

37:34.280 --> 37:38.068
And Korbel is champagne.
Doesn't mean
I'm going to drink it.

37:38.150 --> 37:40.414
The nail polish
is for the acetone.

37:40.490 --> 37:43.982
Helps pull up any
foreign elements,
like copolymer resinase.

37:44.060 --> 37:46.528
In the van, for instance,
which helped lead
us to the missile.

37:47.790 --> 37:49.655
Yes, it certainly did.

37:49.730 --> 37:51.527
Yeah, and the curler
allows me to cut through
the subderma

37:51.600 --> 37:53.261
after rigor mortis sets in.

37:53.330 --> 37:55.992
It warms the muscle mass
and allows me to cut shallow

37:56.070 --> 37:57.799
without damaging
the surrounding tissue.

37:57.870 --> 38:00.236
Couple tricks I
learned in training.
At Quantico.

38:00.310 --> 38:01.777
Mmm-hmm.

38:03.040 --> 38:06.146
Well, I'm really glad
we had this conversation.

38:07.450 --> 38:08.712
Good night.
Good night...

38:09.420 --> 38:10.648
Eliot.

38:16.660 --> 38:21.654
Well, your solve rate remains
at 100%, thanks to me.

38:21.730 --> 38:24.119
You always did
like taking credit
for my hard work.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.326
What? I have never...

38:25.400 --> 38:27.027
July 11th, 2004.

38:27.100 --> 38:29.193
We were putting
our clothes back on
and you said "you're welcome"

38:29.270 --> 38:31.659
when we both know
I did most of the work.

38:31.740 --> 38:33.708
Wow.

38:33.770 --> 38:35.635
That's pretty coclq.
Yeah.

38:35.710 --> 38:37.075
Doesn't sound like me,
though.

38:37.140 --> 38:38.300
Yes, it does.

38:38.380 --> 38:39.608
Yeah, it does.

38:42.780 --> 38:45.749
You know, yesterday I said
I wasn't sad when you left.

38:45.820 --> 38:50.109
What you said was
it was the best
day of your life.

38:50.190 --> 38:52.283
Well, maybe I was
a little bit bummed.

38:52.360 --> 38:55.227
Well, we always
did run hot and cold,
you and me.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.790
We were either fighting...

38:56.860 --> 38:59.226
We got so loud that
one time the neighbors
called the cops.

38:59.300 --> 39:01.564
Our fights got
pretty loud, too.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.460
What the hell
were we thinking, uh?

39:04.170 --> 39:05.239
Getting married.

39:05.310 --> 39:06.800
We were wasted.

39:06.870 --> 39:09.907
Yeah, you blame the alcohol,
but how could you resist, uh?

39:09.980 --> 39:11.402
Apparently, I didn't.

39:13.580 --> 39:15.343
I have a gift for you.

39:15.420 --> 39:16.773
Really?
Hmm.

39:20.390 --> 39:22.858
Divorce decree.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.888
Thought these
were supposed to take
six months to get.

39:24.960 --> 39:27.087
Well, Al's got connections,
you know?

39:27.160 --> 39:29.048
Once you sign
this you're going
to have a really hard time

39:29.130 --> 39:31.519
keeping all those
women hell-bent on
marriage off your back.

39:31.600 --> 39:34.364
I'll figure out something.
I'm elusive.

39:35.340 --> 39:36.364
Okay.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.362
I know pronounce us

39:39.240 --> 39:42.107
man and ex-wife.

39:43.740 --> 39:47.369
Guess that doesn't come
With a "you may now
kiss the ex

39:48.050 --> 39:49.745
Sure it does.

40:07.170 --> 40:09.331
You know what?

40:09.400 --> 40:13.029
Maybe next time,
I'll take a real
vacation up here.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.200
Will you show me around?

40:17.210 --> 40:18.404
Yeah, I'll show you around.

40:18.480 --> 40:19.640
Yeah?

40:22.480 --> 40:23.469
Hey.

40:24.950 --> 40:27.441
Thanks for your help.

40:27.520 --> 40:30.387
For everyone's. Let them know
how grateful I am, all right?

40:33.660 --> 40:35.196
For Cody.

40:40.130 --> 40:42.394
God, it is...
It is hard to list

40:42.470 --> 40:46.804
all the unorthodox,
really questionable tactics

40:46.870 --> 40:48.167
taken during this case.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.231
Hey, then don't. Am I right?

40:50.310 --> 40:52.073
I'm so_not used to
being interrupted.

40:52.150 --> 40:53.276
Oh, yes, he is.

40:53.350 --> 40:56.046
What I wanted to
say was "good job."

40:56.120 --> 40:59.317
Actually, ifI may,
I just want to say

40:59.390 --> 41:00.914
it really has been an honor
working with you guys.

41:00.990 --> 41:02.548
Yeah, not so fast.

41:02.620 --> 41:05.088
It appears as though
you've impressed
Carrie and Al

41:05.160 --> 41:08.698
with your aptitude
and moxie and instinct.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.193
And I would like...
We would.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.490
We would like to offer you...

41:12.570 --> 41:14.788
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean,
I'll take it, you know.

41:15.670 --> 41:17.297
Well. All right.

41:17.370 --> 41:18.439
Yes.
Oh, man.

41:18.510 --> 41:19.761
Come here.

41:19.840 --> 41:21.398
Don't hug me.
Carrie Wells.

41:22.810 --> 41:23.970
Oh, my God.

41:24.040 --> 41:25.177
Please could you
put me down?

41:25.250 --> 41:27.138
Put her down or
you're fired, Denny.

41:27.210 --> 41:29.019
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

41:29.080 --> 41:30.308
Too much? That's my bad.
No, it's good.

41:30.380 --> 41:32.143
Come with me.
We'll start your paperwork.

41:32.220 --> 41:33.482
Maybe you can
tell me something

41:33.550 --> 41:34.756
about that
broken coffee machine.

41:34.820 --> 41:36.048
Oh, yeah. So...

41:36.120 --> 41:38.623
I'll do that, boss.
I'll fix it.

41:38.690 --> 41:40.055
Yeah,
maybe I'll get a hug, too.

41:41.030 --> 41:44.124
So, you're single again.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.667
Thanks to you.
Yeah.

41:45.730 --> 41:47.527
Want to make an honest woman
out of me?

41:47.600 --> 41:50.296
Oh, getting married?
Sure as hell won't do that.

41:50.370 --> 41:54.067
Right, I have
too many secrets to
be an honest woman.

41:54.140 --> 41:56.131
Come on,
your secrets are
your best part.

41:56.210 --> 41:57.370
I thought my
best part was my...

41:57.440 --> 41:58.543
That's not bad either.

41:58.610 --> 42:00.009
And then I've got my...

42:00.080 --> 42:01.399
You've got
a lot of best parts.

42:03.250 --> 42:04.239
So do you.

42:05.720 --> 42:08.041
Want to go get a drink?

42:08.120 --> 42:09.849
I like the sound of that.

42:09.920 --> 42:11.512
All right, let's do it.
Okay.

42:11.590 --> 42:13.626
Where should we go?
I don't know, your place?

42:13.690 --> 42:16.295
Slow down, I'm just
getting over a divorce,
remember?
