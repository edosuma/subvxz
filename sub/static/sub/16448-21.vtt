WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:07.275
You're kidding me.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.610
( Knife rattling )

00:09.677 --> 00:13.114
( Sighs, exhales deeply )

00:20.654 --> 00:22.223
Oh, yeah.

00:27.395 --> 00:28.662
Ooh.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.464
( Thud )
Ooh.

00:36.204 --> 00:38.606
( Haughty voice ) Finding
a toy in his enclosure,

00:38.672 --> 00:42.210
the mature silverback will be
entertained for hours.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.713
Very funny. Ahh!

00:45.779 --> 00:47.515
There he is. Oh, man.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.150
Why don't we get
the big jar anymore?

00:49.217 --> 00:50.851
That is the big one.

00:50.918 --> 00:52.986
No, I'm talking about
the huge one with the handle.

00:53.053 --> 00:56.124
You gotta roll it to your car.
Honey.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.392
We got that once
five years ago

00:58.459 --> 01:00.261
when you were on a big kick
to feed the homeless.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.629
It wasn't a kick, all right?

01:01.695 --> 01:03.131
I like to give back
to the community.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.998
Giving back? Okay.
You, Duffy, and Mott,

01:05.065 --> 01:06.600
you made 30 sandwiches,

01:06.667 --> 01:08.169
and by the time you got to
the homeless shelter,

01:08.236 --> 01:09.437
you had, like, five left.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.507
A water main broke.
They shut down the expressway.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.676
We sat in our car
for two hours listening
to a Met game.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.346
What? We're not gonna eat
25 sandwiches?

01:19.980 --> 01:24.585
* I am not your ordinary guy

01:27.054 --> 01:28.422
This isn't happening.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.591
Donna! Donna!

01:30.658 --> 01:32.260
Hey. What's up?

01:32.326 --> 01:33.794
The guys are coming over
to watch a Met game

01:33.861 --> 01:36.197
and it's saying
we don't subscribe
to the sports package.

01:36.264 --> 01:39.133
Yeah, I'm sorry. I had to
downgrade our cable.

01:42.270 --> 01:43.804
Downgrade to what?

01:43.871 --> 01:45.473
Not to Basic.
Don't tell me Basic.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.441
Basic.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.009
( Groans )

01:49.076 --> 01:50.978
Oh.

01:51.044 --> 01:55.316
All right, we've been married
for 20 years, so I'm...

01:55.383 --> 01:58.619
I'm gonna give you a chance
to explain yourself.

01:58.686 --> 02:01.322
We have to pay
for Kendra's wedding.

02:01.389 --> 02:02.723
And you haven't really been
working

02:02.790 --> 02:05.159
that many side jobs lately,
so...

02:05.226 --> 02:07.161
They're brutal. But that's
no reason to go to Basic.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.663
We're not animals.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.665
( Knock on door )

02:11.732 --> 02:14.802
Yo. We win today,
that's a 3-game sweep.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.036
And Syndergaard's on the hill.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.771
Yeah, there's nobody
on the hill.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.039
What are you talkin' about?

02:19.106 --> 02:21.209
Donna canceled
our sports package.

02:21.275 --> 02:24.678
All right, good times, man.
No, wait, wait. Wait up.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.414
There's gonna be a replay
of it tonight.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.216
Let's catch it at Enzo's,
all right?

02:28.282 --> 02:29.883
Ah, I can't.
I got an early gig
in the morning

02:29.950 --> 02:31.352
driving some guy in the city.

02:31.419 --> 02:33.487
Let me do that for you.
Let me fill in, please.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.256
Come on, we need the money,
and I --

02:35.323 --> 02:37.558
I'm a man without
a sports package. Come on.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.827
Uh, I don't know.
I mean, these are --

02:39.893 --> 02:42.029
these are VIPs,
CEOs you're driving.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.197
I can handle that.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.498
All right, let me think
about it.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.999
Let me help you process
right here.
Ah. Hey.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.301
-Hey, sweetheart. Guess what?
-What?

02:47.368 --> 02:49.237
Goody got me a job driving
a CEO. How cool is that?

02:49.303 --> 02:50.904
Oh, that's so great.
Thank you, Goody.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.740
-Isn't he the best? Yeah.
-Glad to help.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.375
Yeah, yeah.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.346
All right. Welcome back,
premium cable.
( Door closes )

02:58.412 --> 02:59.980
Okay.

03:00.047 --> 03:01.849
All right,
sorry I turned on you before.

03:01.915 --> 03:05.319
Last six minutes
without sports was
pretty stressful.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.054
We both said some things
that we regret,

03:07.120 --> 03:09.423
I'm sure, and just, uh...
I just stood here, and you --

03:09.490 --> 03:11.759
Let's not relive it. Let's not
really -- it doesn't matter.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.261
Hey? Hello?

03:13.327 --> 03:14.828
45-minute wait?

03:14.895 --> 03:16.697
You ruined my life!

03:19.032 --> 03:22.002
( Horns honking )

03:22.069 --> 03:25.105
How's it goin', man?
I'm heading over to
the convention center.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.575
Yes, sir. I'm Kevin Gable,
your driver.

03:27.641 --> 03:30.278
You enjoy the ride,
Mr. Conrad.
( Seatbelt clicks )

03:30.344 --> 03:32.880
( Shifts gears )

03:42.956 --> 03:46.026
Sorry, but, uh, can I ask you
a question, Mr. Conrad?

03:46.093 --> 03:48.262
Are you Harry Connick Jr.?

03:48.329 --> 03:50.598
Yeah. They make me use
a different name

03:50.664 --> 03:51.932
for security purposes.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.334
It's -- it's stupid.

03:53.401 --> 03:56.103
No, no, no. I'm a retired cop.
So I get it.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.471
A lot of crazies out there.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.640
Better safe than waking up
in a tub of ice

03:59.707 --> 04:02.410
with a kidney missing,
you know?

04:03.644 --> 04:05.479
I'm, uh, I'm gonna stop
talking now.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.615
If you need anything,
you just let me know.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.617
Will do, Kenny.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.320
Oh, actually, Mr. Connick,
my name is --

04:12.386 --> 04:15.856
Hey, you know what?
In this car, no "misters."
All right?

04:15.923 --> 04:18.959
It's just Harry and Kenny.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.731
( Under breath ) Harry and...

04:23.797 --> 04:26.434
I'm Kenny.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.636
What are you, uh,
you doing a concert?

04:28.702 --> 04:32.272
It's a charity thing.
I feel so blessed,
I like to give back.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.141
Yeah. I'm with you on that.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.676
You're involved
in charity work?

04:37.277 --> 04:38.979
Y-Yes, I am. Yeah.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.681
What -- what --
what do you do?

04:40.748 --> 04:42.950
Uh, right now, I am. uh,

04:43.016 --> 04:45.886
focused on feeding
the homeless, you know?

04:45.953 --> 04:50.223
It's just -- no big deal.
We just make a bunch
of sandwiches.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.793
You know, would it be easier
to cut a check and just

04:52.860 --> 04:54.828
buy 'em at the store?
Yeah, it would be.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.464
It would be a lot easier,
but you know what?

04:56.530 --> 05:00.000
I think we gain so much more
as a family unit

05:00.067 --> 05:03.837
if we, uh, make
the sandwiches, you know,

05:03.904 --> 05:07.207
together with --
with love.

05:07.274 --> 05:08.976
That's beautiful, Kenny.

05:09.042 --> 05:12.880
Yeah, it's my passion.
Making sandwiches.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.549
Only tough part is
giving them away.

05:15.616 --> 05:19.420
Mm, 'cause it brings you
face to face with
the people in need.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.855
Yeah. Sure.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.395
Hey, how was work?

05:27.461 --> 05:30.364
You mean my job driving
multiple Grammy winner

05:30.431 --> 05:33.367
and talk show host
Harry Connick Jr.?

05:33.434 --> 05:35.302
What?! You shut your fat face!

05:35.369 --> 05:37.204
( Gasps ) I --

05:43.444 --> 05:45.278
I am so sorry.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.714
It -- it flew right out.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.149
We're good. We're okay.
Okay, wait, so...

05:49.216 --> 05:50.751
So what's he like?

05:50.818 --> 05:52.352
He's the greatest.
Oh, I knew it!

05:52.420 --> 05:53.721
I'm telling you,
he's just a regular guy.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.222
And he loves me.
I'm telling you,
we hit it off.

05:55.288 --> 05:56.590
( Phone ringing )
This could be the job
I'm dreaming of.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.191
-Oh, my God.
-Hello?

05:58.258 --> 05:59.460
Sorry, there's no Kenny here.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.094
Whoa, whoa, that's me.
That's me.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.063
-Hold on.
-I got that.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.732
Yo, go for Kenny.

06:04.798 --> 06:05.966
Hey, Harry.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.868
( Whispering )
Is that Harry Connick Jr.?

06:07.935 --> 06:10.170
( Whispering )
Just shut up, shut up!
Is that Harry --

06:10.237 --> 06:11.772
Shut up, shut up!

06:11.839 --> 06:14.742
( Normal voice ) Yeah. Am I
available for the whole week?

06:14.808 --> 06:16.243
I gotta check my calendar.

06:16.309 --> 06:17.545
( Mutters indistinctly )
Ow. Okay.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.547
Uh, yeah,
I can make it work.

06:19.613 --> 06:23.150
Okay, great, I'll see you
tomorrow. Okay.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.155
( Stammers nervously )

06:28.221 --> 06:29.623
He wants you to drive him
for the whole week?

06:29.690 --> 06:31.291
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.
That is incredible.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.727
-Yes.
-What was with
the Kenny thing?

06:33.794 --> 06:36.830
Oh, it's not a big deal.
He thinks my name's Kenny.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.398
Why?

06:38.466 --> 06:40.000
Well, I guess
he called me Kenny
and I didn't correct him.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.169
He's Harry Connick Jr.
I'll just fix it tomorrow.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.071
Okay, but don't embarrass him,
all right?

06:44.137 --> 06:46.339
You need this job,
plus he's an artist.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.176
So he's probably sensitive,
but really strong

06:49.242 --> 06:51.579
with a tender touch.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.114
You done?

06:54.181 --> 06:55.949
Sorry. I'm sorry.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.685
( Inhales sharply )
Yeah, now I'm done.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.252
Yeah, okay.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.689
( Car door opens )

07:01.755 --> 07:04.525
Kenny, my man. What's good?

07:04.592 --> 07:08.662
Everything,
Harry Connick...Jr.
Everything.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.297
( Click )

07:10.363 --> 07:12.600
Although, there was one thing
I just wanted to, uh,

07:12.666 --> 07:14.301
clear up vis-à-vis my name.

07:14.367 --> 07:17.170
Hey, hey, didn't you say
your last name was Gable?

07:17.237 --> 07:18.338
I-I did.

07:18.405 --> 07:19.540
Kenny Gable.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.475
That makes you Kenny G.

07:21.542 --> 07:25.445
You know...
( Imitates saxophone )

07:25.513 --> 07:27.581
Kenny G., man! ( Laughs )
( Laughs )

07:27.648 --> 07:30.818
Yeah, yeah, right. We have
the same initials, but --

07:30.884 --> 07:32.319
No, no, no, that's hilarious.
Yeah.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.522
Kenny G. is my driver?

07:34.588 --> 07:36.389
If you tell me you play
the saxophone,

07:36.456 --> 07:37.891
we're gonna be friends
for life.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.528
( Laughs )

07:40.594 --> 07:42.195
I dabble.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.769
-Hey. How was Harry?
-Awesome.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.504
I mean, I might've told
a couple more lies

07:50.571 --> 07:52.973
like I play the sax
and my grandfather invented

07:53.040 --> 07:56.844
jalapeño poppers, but...man.
( Bottle cap fizzes )

07:56.910 --> 07:59.212
What a day.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.414
( Bottle cap clatters )
What is wrong with you?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.250
He's a celebrity.
I can't stop lying.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.453
Hey, celebrities are just
people like you and me.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.088
Oh, yeah. They're just
like us, right?
Yeah.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.591
So if I pop on the TV
tomorrow, I can see
the Donna Gable show?

08:10.658 --> 08:13.661
No, I can't. You know why?
You don't have a show.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.829
Please don't go crazy
with this, all right?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.264
We need you to keep this job.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.932
I'm not going crazy with this,
all right?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.434
That's what Harry likes
about me, how unaffected I am.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.837
( Cellphone ringing )

08:23.904 --> 08:25.105
Oh, that's him.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.540
All right, I'm gonna wait
for four rings,

08:26.607 --> 08:27.608
then I'm gonna answer it.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.109
What? What if it goes to
voicemail

08:29.176 --> 08:31.579
and he doesn't leave
a message?
( Ring )

08:31.645 --> 08:33.246
Hello?

08:40.153 --> 08:42.656
Hey, Kenny.

08:42.723 --> 08:43.957
Kenny?

08:45.158 --> 08:46.660
Kenny?

08:48.128 --> 08:49.529
Kenny.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.233
Kenny?

08:57.104 --> 08:58.639
Kenny.

08:58.706 --> 09:01.074
I've been calling you like
crazy. Didn't you hear me?

09:01.141 --> 09:03.844
Oh, you know what?
I'll tell you what it is.
My bad ear.

09:03.911 --> 09:04.945
I got a bad ear.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.647
Oh, man.
You were on the force.

09:06.714 --> 09:09.249
Yeah, I got a buddy. He's on
the job down in New Orleans,

09:09.316 --> 09:11.051
and a gun went off
really close to his ear.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.352
He can't hear anything.

09:12.419 --> 09:15.155
Oh, yeah. See,
stuff like that happens.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.625
I-I don't like to talk
about it, 'cause, you know...

09:17.691 --> 09:21.228
You're humble. Yeah?
Mm...

09:21.294 --> 09:24.998
Hey, hey, tomorrow,
I wanna buy and all
your friends a beer.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.533
No, you don't have to
do that. I don't --

09:26.600 --> 09:27.701
No, I want to.
I really want to.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.302
And maybe we could talk
about you

09:29.369 --> 09:31.138
becoming my full-time driver,
huh?

09:31.204 --> 09:33.373
How's that sound?
That sounds good.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.541
All right.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.009
I mean, it sounds good
over here, you know.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.878
In this ear, it just sounds
like whales talking.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.681
( Imitating whales calling )

09:40.748 --> 09:43.150
It's just a...

09:43.216 --> 09:45.318
All right, the reason
I summoned you guys here today

09:45.385 --> 09:46.654
is I may be bringing by
a client,

09:46.720 --> 09:48.756
and I just wanna cover
some ground rules, you know,

09:48.822 --> 09:50.190
for security purposes.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.859
Security purposes?
Who is it?

09:51.925 --> 09:55.528
I'm -- I'm not at liberty
to say. It's Harry Connick Jr.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.298
Harry Connick Jr. at Enzo's?
That's crazy!

09:58.365 --> 09:59.733
Whoa, whoa, wait.
That's who you're driving?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.034
That was supposed to be
my gig.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.736
Well, believe me, he doesn't
even wanna come here.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.237
He's doing me a favor because
we've pretty much

10:04.304 --> 10:05.572
become blood brothers,
all right?

10:05.639 --> 10:07.207
I wanted to throw
you guys a bone.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.177
You gotta at least
do me a solid and give
him Didi's demo CD.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.946
It's three tracks of hot fire.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.682
The only reason
I'm in Harry's inner circle

10:14.748 --> 10:16.116
is because he trusts me.

10:16.183 --> 10:19.219
My job is keeping people
like you away from him.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.188
Yeah, well, personally,
I can't stand the guy.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.990
What? Why?

10:23.056 --> 10:25.225
Ah, you know, a few years ago,
I followed him
into a men's room

10:25.292 --> 10:27.027
at a Knick game and tried
to get a selfie with him.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.796
He said,
"Can we do this outside?"

10:28.862 --> 10:30.698
What's wrong with that?

10:30.764 --> 10:33.633
It's just the way he said it.
Very 'tude-ish.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.035
Can I at least tell my ma?

10:35.102 --> 10:37.370
You know how Rita is with
celebrity autographs.

10:37.437 --> 10:40.540
Yeah, she sells 'em on eBay.
No. Okay?

10:40.607 --> 10:42.375
So what's gonna happen,
when we get here,

10:42.442 --> 10:44.511
I'm gonna set up a nice table
because people are gonna be

10:44.577 --> 10:45.846
losing their minds.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.447
Everybody's gonna wanna be
hanging out with us.

10:47.514 --> 10:49.983
Us? Nobody cares about you.
We want Harry.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.652
Did you star
in "Hope Floats"?

10:52.720 --> 10:55.022
No, I didn't.
But everything
goes through me.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.424
So I will individually
walk you over to him.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.093
You get 30 seconds.
No pictures, no autographs,

11:00.160 --> 11:01.829
and don't bring any guests,
all right?

11:01.895 --> 11:03.430
Harry's a private guy.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.433
He wants to spend
a quiet evening with me.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.568
So this is the deal --
any shenanigans,

11:08.635 --> 11:12.039
I'm telling you
right up front,
I will shut it down.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.075
I'm just looking
for an apology.

11:15.142 --> 11:18.511
You're never getting close
enough, guy, not on my watch.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.549
( Keys clatter )
Hi. You missed dinner.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.718
Sorry. I was at Enzo's.
Work-related.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.720
-Right. Work.
-Seriously, for Harry.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.588
Had to do a little recon
for tomorrow night

11:28.655 --> 11:30.223
when he takes me out
to discuss

11:30.290 --> 11:31.925
me becoming
his full-time driver.

11:31.992 --> 11:35.562
No way. Oh, it is so cool
that you're driving Harry.

11:35.628 --> 11:36.629
Mm-hmm.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.099
Harry?
From One Direction?

11:42.736 --> 11:43.804
Yes.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.572
Life is incredible!

11:45.638 --> 11:47.340
Yeah.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.608
So are you serious?

11:48.675 --> 11:50.643
He wants you to be
his full-time driver?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.145
Donna he loves me.
I'm telling you.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.247
Enough that he would want to
sing at Kendra's wedding?

11:54.314 --> 11:55.682
I'm not asking for that.

11:55.749 --> 11:56.884
Everybody's hitting him
up for stuff.
Oh, my God.

11:56.950 --> 11:57.985
No, no, no, no.
What? Like what?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.319
Tickets, autographs.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.454
Goody wanted me to pass along
Didi's singing demo.

12:01.521 --> 12:02.790
Didi sings?

12:02.856 --> 12:04.291
( Scoffs ) Apparently.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.393
It's supposed to be
three tracks of hot fire.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.461
That's so weird. I mean,
after all these years,

12:08.528 --> 12:10.063
you'd think that would've
come up.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.331
-Yeah.
-Have you ever heard her sing?

12:11.398 --> 12:13.100
I haven't heard her whistle.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.235
Well, I mean, that's crazy.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.504
You only get one chip
with a celebrity and I mean,

12:17.570 --> 12:19.739
no offense, we're not using it
on Didi.

12:19.807 --> 12:22.075
I agree. If you haven't
made it by 40, it's time

12:22.142 --> 12:23.510
to take the dream
out in the backyard

12:23.576 --> 12:25.846
and let it go like a balloon
at a birthday party

12:25.913 --> 12:29.149
and then
shoot it with a BB gun.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.285
What time should I be
at Enzo's?

12:32.352 --> 12:33.586
'Cause I wanna put on a dress.
I wanna get my nails done.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.188
-No, no, no, no. Hey, no.
-What?

12:35.255 --> 12:37.590
'Cause I already promised
Harry a very quiet
evening with me.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.259
And that's what he's gettin'.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.595
How's the, uh,
how's the lasagna?

12:42.662 --> 12:43.763
It's good.

12:43.831 --> 12:46.499
Harry Connick likes
the frickin' lasagna!

12:46.566 --> 12:49.636
( Cheering )

12:55.976 --> 12:57.310
Sorry about all this.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.146
I have no idea how they found
out you'd even be here.

12:59.212 --> 13:03.350
Everybody, hold up a second.
Hold on! Go ahead, baby.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.685
Hey, Harry.
This goes out to you.

13:05.752 --> 13:08.355
( Amplified voice )
* Sunrise in the distance

13:08.421 --> 13:10.690
* A tear rolling down
my face *

13:10.757 --> 13:13.493
* Don't want any resistance

13:13.560 --> 13:15.929
* We've both been
to this place *

13:15.996 --> 13:19.967
* I want it all, but I don't
wanna seem greedy *

13:24.704 --> 13:25.906
There he is, Ma.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.740
Get a good look and then
I'll take you home.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.809
I wanna touch him.
No, you're not touching him,
Rita.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.278
Come on, get her out of here.
Wheels up, wheels up.
All right, all right,

13:31.344 --> 13:32.545
all right, guy, calm down.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.147
Sorry, Harry.
I'll be right back.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.483
Come on, man!

13:36.549 --> 13:39.552
Hey, can I get another beer,
please? Thanks.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.260
How you doin', man?

13:47.327 --> 13:49.496
You know what?
Don't even try.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.167
Kenny. Kenny!

13:54.234 --> 13:56.169
Hi. Kenny, come here.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.471
Kenny, come here. Hey.

13:58.538 --> 13:59.973
You need to introduce me
to Harry.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.341
Yeah, you and everybody else.

14:01.408 --> 14:04.844
And take it down
with the perfume.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.779
( Speaking indistinctly )

14:06.846 --> 14:08.381
Okay. Hey, no selfies.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.582
Excuse me. No selfies, please.

14:09.649 --> 14:10.650
-No self -- hey.
( Shutter clicks )

14:11.684 --> 14:13.353
( Shutter clicks )

14:13.420 --> 14:15.055
( Clicking continues )

14:20.760 --> 14:22.930
( Sighs ) I just can't
stop thinking about it.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.532
I-I blew it.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.801
Well, maybe it's not as bad
as you think.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.805
I'm his driver,
and the guy left without me.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.242
It's pretty bad.
Yeah.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.911
Can you just apologize
to him tomorrow?

14:37.978 --> 14:39.812
There's not gonna be
a tomorrow, Donna.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.481
He hasn't called me.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.651
You know, it's --
it's probably for the best.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.320
I'll tell you,
driving a celebrity, it's...

14:47.387 --> 14:49.656
just too much pressure,
you know?

14:49.722 --> 14:52.492
And besides, this is
the whole reason I retired

14:52.559 --> 14:55.262
right here, right?
Just spend time, you and I.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.596
It's nice.
Yep.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.131
( Cellphone ringing )

14:58.198 --> 14:59.899
-It's him!
-Oh, my God --

15:01.168 --> 15:03.570
Hello? Hello?

15:03.636 --> 15:05.672
Hey, Harry. Tomorrow?

15:05.738 --> 15:07.407
I gotta check my schedule.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.842
Yeah, looks like we're good.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.411
I'll see you then.

15:11.478 --> 15:12.845
Kenny G. is back!

15:15.048 --> 15:16.483
( Mouth full )
Claudia, these taquitos

15:16.549 --> 15:19.919
are better than last week,
and that is saying something.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.189
Nice job. Nice. Way to go.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.857
Killin' it.
( Cheering )

15:24.924 --> 15:27.427
Before we wrap it up,
every once in a while,

15:27.494 --> 15:29.562
you come across someone
in your everyday life

15:29.629 --> 15:32.932
who really makes an impact,
somebody real,
someone genuine.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.702
And for me,
it's my driver, Kenny.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.637
Let's bring him out.
Kenny, get on out here.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.708
Kenny. Kenny.
Harry's calling for you.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.210
-What?
-Harry's calling for you.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.212
Let's get you mic'ed up.
Come on.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.180
( Cheers and applause )

15:47.247 --> 15:48.748
Hey, Kenny!

15:48.815 --> 15:52.052
( Cheering continues )

15:52.119 --> 15:53.153
Come on.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.487
( Cheering continues )

15:54.554 --> 15:56.323
-How you doin'?
-Good. Good, good, good.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.590
Come on. Have a seat.

15:57.657 --> 16:00.127
( Cheering, whistling )

16:00.193 --> 16:02.295
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.264
Now -- now Kenny was on
the Long Island police force

16:04.331 --> 16:05.798
for 20 years.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.467
Let's give him a round
of applause for that.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.203
( Cheers and applause )

16:10.270 --> 16:12.239
And in addition to raising
a family

16:12.305 --> 16:15.675
and driving me around all day,
this guy still finds time

16:15.742 --> 16:18.511
to make sandwiches
for the homeless.

16:18.578 --> 16:21.581
( Cheers and applause )

16:21.648 --> 16:24.884
I'm not cutting the crust off.
I'm no saint. ( Chuckles )

16:24.951 --> 16:26.519
I love -- I love this guy.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.589
Now check this out.
His name is Kenny Gable.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.391
I call him Kenny G.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.760
And believe it or not,
he plays the saxophone.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.462
No, no, no, I-I --
( Cheers and applause )

16:35.528 --> 16:36.729
No, no, no, no.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.498
Now, now --
I don't wanna...

16:38.565 --> 16:41.268
Unfortunately, Kenny told me
he lost his sax

16:41.334 --> 16:43.070
in Hurricane Sandy.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.604
Audience: Aww!

16:44.671 --> 16:46.239
I did say that.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.041
I probably didn't keep it
on a high enough shelf.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.910
Uh, it's -- that's my bad.

16:50.977 --> 16:53.613
Well, I wanna tell you
something.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.749
We -- at the Harry show,
we got a little surprise
for you.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.021
Here you go.
( Cheers and applause )

17:02.089 --> 17:04.291
I don't, um...

17:06.926 --> 17:08.095
You enjoy that, my man.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.230
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.699
I think we have time
to hear Kenny play

17:12.765 --> 17:14.467
a little bit on that bad boy.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.635
( Cheering continues )
I think he should play that.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.036
Come on, baby!

17:17.104 --> 17:18.805
You guys wanna hear
Kenny play?

17:18.871 --> 17:21.474
Oh, heck, yes!

17:21.541 --> 17:23.042
Come on, baby.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.978
Oh, don't try and play that,
guy.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.082
Please don't try
and play that.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.783
Come on, baby.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.452
Play something tasty.

17:32.519 --> 17:35.155
( Snapping fingers )
Yeah.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.924
( Scatting )

17:37.990 --> 17:40.427
( Scatting )
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on,
come on, play, play, play.

17:40.493 --> 17:44.464
( Scatting continues )

17:44.531 --> 17:46.133
Come on, come on, walk it
for me, man, come on.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.234
Okay.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.935
( Scatting )

17:49.001 --> 17:51.171
Yeah, warm it up, warm it up,
warm it up.

17:51.238 --> 17:55.242
( Scatting )

17:55.308 --> 17:57.310
Oh, come on, come on, come on,
you got it.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.078
Come on.
( Audience clapping
rhythmically )

17:59.146 --> 18:00.680
Oh, Lord, please, one time.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.516
( Clapping continues )

18:05.118 --> 18:07.053
( Plays flat note )

18:07.120 --> 18:08.555
( Blows air )

18:08.621 --> 18:10.823
( Plays flat note )

18:10.890 --> 18:12.359
( Clears throat )
This one's a little, uh,

18:12.425 --> 18:14.026
it's a little jacked up
a little bit there
in the front.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.829
Let's get a, uh...
Hold on a second.

18:16.896 --> 18:20.200
( Playing off-key )

18:20.267 --> 18:22.569
( Coughs )
This is a different, uh...

18:22.635 --> 18:23.803
The mouth...

18:26.105 --> 18:28.007
( Playing off-key )

18:28.074 --> 18:29.476
You don't play, do ya?

18:29.542 --> 18:31.010
( Blows air )

18:32.779 --> 18:34.447
Nope.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.115
Do you at least have
a hearing problem?

18:36.183 --> 18:37.750
-I do not.
-Oh, stop talking.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.620
Just stop talking.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.456
Not a proud day
for the Gables.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.625
Sandwiches
for the homeless?

18:45.692 --> 18:46.826
Once.

18:46.893 --> 18:49.396
I ate most of them.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.531
Wow.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.866
Wow, I don't -- I don't even
know what to say, Kenny.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.570
There might be one more thing.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.512
I know I said it before,
but I really
mean it this time.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.414
This is -- this is
what it's all about.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.749
And you're sure you're okay
watching Harry's show?

19:09.816 --> 19:11.551
Yeah, I mean,
he's a good guy.

19:11.618 --> 19:14.454
You know, it just didn't
work out with me and all.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.555
( Sighs ) Yeah.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.890
I mean it,
being here with you,

19:17.957 --> 19:19.226
nothing can hurt me.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.893
( Cheers and applause )

19:20.960 --> 19:22.595
You know, one of
my big thrills is
discovering new talent,

19:22.662 --> 19:24.096
and this one's as good
as it gets.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.333
With her new single,
"Yes Indeedy,"

19:26.399 --> 19:28.601
my good friend Didi Goodman.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.237
( Applause )

19:30.303 --> 19:33.039
Didi:
* Sunrise in the distance

19:33.105 --> 19:36.175
* A tear rollin' down
my face *

19:36.243 --> 19:39.212
* We don't want
any resistance *

19:39.279 --> 19:42.148
* We both came to this place

19:42.215 --> 19:47.019
* I want it all, but I don't
wanna be greedy *

19:47.086 --> 19:49.121
* Ooh, if you're asking...

19:49.188 --> 19:51.591
Not gonna lie,
that stings a little.

19:51.658 --> 19:55.895
* Say yes indeedy

19:55.962 --> 19:59.266
* Don't want no
sweet perfume *

19:59.332 --> 20:02.802
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

20:02.869 --> 20:05.004
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:05.071 --> 20:06.539
* Do, do, do, do

20:06.606 --> 20:10.142
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

20:10.209 --> 20:13.212
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

20:13.280 --> 20:15.848
* I just don't want no...
