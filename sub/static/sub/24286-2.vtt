WEBVTT

00:09.760 --> 00:13.264
Zombies!

00:13.264 --> 00:15.307
Excuse me, son,
will your mother be much longer?

00:15.307 --> 00:16.851
Die, undead!

00:16.851 --> 00:19.353
You can shuffle,
but you can't hide.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.328 --> 00:37.955
Gimme a hand...

00:46.714 --> 00:48.716
Will you please tell your mother

00:48.716 --> 00:50.384
that I ha...

00:50.384 --> 00:52.344
I have another appointment.

00:52.344 --> 00:55.097
Oh.
Mom said she'd be right back.

01:00.811 --> 01:03.147
Would you start
the zipper for me, hon?

01:10.196 --> 01:12.990
Ah.

01:12.990 --> 01:16.202
Such a gentleman.

01:16.202 --> 01:17.453
Night.

02:08.838 --> 02:12.716
Please tell me this is
just the first installment.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.385
I-I'm afraid not,
Mrs. McKenna.

02:14.385 --> 02:16.428
That represents
the entire payout

02:16.428 --> 02:18.889
for the policy
on your late husband.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.100
You don't understand.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.769
I'm responsible
for my three children,

02:23.769 --> 02:25.896
my mother-in-law,
and my brother-in-law,

02:25.896 --> 02:27.940
so l-let's just say
five children.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.401
I understand that you're going
through a very difficult time.

02:30.401 --> 02:32.736
Please, I don't
need compassion right now.

02:32.736 --> 02:37.199
I needed it when you guys
were writing this check.

02:37.199 --> 02:42.538
This is financially disastrous
for my family.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.461
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Foster.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.297
My condolences,
Mrs. McKenna.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.507
And if it's any consolation,

02:53.507 --> 02:58.178
um...I hate my job.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.524
Nailed it.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.026
Okay.

03:13.402 --> 03:16.530
So,
how do the zombies die?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.282
They're dead.
You can't kill them.

03:18.282 --> 03:19.909
No, you kill them
with your fists.

03:19.909 --> 03:21.327
You punch them. They would

03:21.327 --> 03:22.912
keep fighting.
Why would they just die?

03:22.912 --> 03:24.371
What's the point
of a score?

03:24.371 --> 03:26.081
Hey. To brag

03:26.081 --> 03:27.917
- to your friends?
- We'll figure it out.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.752
You're resourceful,

03:29.752 --> 03:31.503
and--and we can help out.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.464
I can macramÃƒÂ© potholders

03:33.464 --> 03:35.424
and Terry can give blood
every six weeks.

03:35.424 --> 03:38.344
Mm-hmm.
Seriously, Beth,

03:38.344 --> 03:42.222
don't...don't worry-way...

03:42.222 --> 03:44.683
...about money-may.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.185
Hey, Terry, you know that...

03:46.185 --> 03:48.771
...that's not Pig Latin, right?

03:48.771 --> 03:51.690
- Really-ray

03:51.690 --> 03:53.901
I'm even more confused
than usual.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.445
Um, it's just adult talk.
You wouldn't understand.

03:56.445 --> 03:57.738
Shi shi wo.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.199
That's Mandarin for "try me."

04:00.199 --> 04:02.534
My future company is going
to have offices in China.

04:02.534 --> 04:05.579
It's kinder to fire people
in their own language.

04:05.579 --> 04:09.583
Mom...is there a money problem?

04:09.583 --> 04:12.461
No.
No problem.

04:12.461 --> 04:15.047
Everything's fine, okay?
Really.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.589
Okay.

04:18.968 --> 04:20.803
You kill the zombie
with your fists?

04:20.803 --> 04:21.971
Yes.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.727
Guys,
I really think

04:28.727 --> 04:30.646
Mom's worried about mo...

04:30.646 --> 04:32.106
What are you...

04:32.106 --> 04:33.774
Are you eating crickets?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.734
Not eating. Swallowing.

04:35.734 --> 04:36.860
Learn the difference.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.529
- -

04:38.529 --> 04:40.197
We're making a video
that's gonna go viral

04:40.197 --> 04:42.074
and make me crazy famous
on the Internet.

04:42.074 --> 04:44.535
Actually, I'm making a video
about how morons will do

04:44.535 --> 04:46.495
anything to try and get
crazy famous on the Internet.

04:46.495 --> 04:49.206
Whatever, as long as I'm gonna
be crazy famous.

04:49.206 --> 04:52.960
I'm going to break the record
for throwing up live crickets.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.546
That sounds crazy stupid.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.548
Your jealousy is ugly, Wyatt.

04:57.548 --> 05:01.260
Guys, I really think Mom is
having money problems.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.470
Mom says
everything is gonna be fine.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.931
Yeah, and who are
we gonna believe, you or Mom?

05:05.931 --> 05:08.392
Okay, Dash, time to look
like an idiot.

05:08.392 --> 05:09.643
I mean, become famous.

05:13.731 --> 05:15.691
- Okay, go.
-

05:15.691 --> 05:17.526
Am I crazy,

05:17.526 --> 05:20.112
or is that more crickets
than I swallowed?

05:50.809 --> 05:52.519
Deal you in, son?

05:54.938 --> 05:56.315
Yeah.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.819
You look good, Wyatt.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.821
Love that smile.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.573
Hi, Dad.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.533
Now, ready to play poker?

06:06.533 --> 06:08.660
- I don't know how.
- Well, that's why I wrote

06:08.660 --> 06:11.747
The Dangerous Book--
to teach you this stuff.

06:11.747 --> 06:17.336
Playing poker requires
sharp wits and nerves of steel.

06:17.336 --> 06:19.046
Sounds pretty good, huh?

06:19.046 --> 06:20.506
It might help you
get up the courage

06:20.506 --> 06:22.382
to talk to
that Maya Fleishacker.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.094
How did you...

06:25.094 --> 06:26.970
Oh, right.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.514
This is my imagination.

06:28.514 --> 06:29.807
And you have a great one.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.183
You know, even as a baby,

06:31.183 --> 06:32.768
your mom and I would
watch you go into

06:32.768 --> 06:33.852
an animated state of wonder,

06:33.852 --> 06:35.270
and your face would contort,

06:35.270 --> 06:37.397
and then get curious,
and finally...

06:37.397 --> 06:40.025
And then you'd smile that smile.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.735
It turned out
you just had a full diaper.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.907
I think
Mom's having money trouble.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.452
What do I do?

06:50.452 --> 06:53.664
Your mom's the smartest person
I know.

06:53.664 --> 06:55.999
She's also incredibly sensitive.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.501
She'll need some help.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.547
Now, then.
Let's play poker.

07:03.924 --> 07:07.010
How are you set up
for insurance, son?

07:07.010 --> 07:09.972
It's never too early
to get some umbrella coverage.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.682
I don't have an umbrella.

07:11.682 --> 07:13.725
Dash jumped off
the roof with it.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.979
I should talk to that kid.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.730
Now, what's so interesting
about poker

07:18.730 --> 07:22.359
is it's all about
observing human behavior...

07:22.359 --> 07:23.861
watching people.

07:23.861 --> 07:25.696
You learn to catch their tell.

07:25.696 --> 07:28.031
And you'll know what
they're not telling you.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.617
It's a very valuable tool
in life.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.954
Is that Mr. Foster's tell?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.539
Could be.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.541
Or he could just be
digging for gold.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.251
Either way...

07:39.251 --> 07:42.296
you just learned
your first lesson in poker.

07:47.176 --> 07:48.802
All of these jobs,

07:48.802 --> 07:50.387
they want you to work
60 hours a week

07:50.387 --> 07:52.264
for minimum wage.

07:52.264 --> 07:53.724
But I guess the good news is,

07:53.724 --> 07:55.350
is that I'm not even qualified
for them

07:55.350 --> 07:57.060
because I don't have an MBA.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.770
What's an MBA?

07:58.770 --> 08:00.647
Apparently, something
you need now to get a job

08:00.647 --> 08:02.774
as a secretary's assistant.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.235
"Aloha Akron."

08:05.235 --> 08:06.528
Aloha, Terry.

08:06.528 --> 08:07.946
No, no, no.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.698
"Aloha Akron."
That's the name

08:09.698 --> 08:11.491
of our new surf shop.

08:11.491 --> 08:15.245
But, Terry, there aren't any
surf shops in Akron, Ohio.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.206
Not yet.

08:17.206 --> 08:18.498
We'll get in
on the ground level.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.167
We'll corner the entire market.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.294
Right, uh...

08:22.294 --> 08:23.795
well, it's an interesting idea.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.422
We should definitely
explore it further.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.382
Great.
Yeah, um...

08:27.382 --> 08:29.760
- let me show you...
- Hmm.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.803
...my business plan.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.222
- Hmm.
- Now, it's not to scale.

08:33.222 --> 08:35.015
Oh, no, no, I got that.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.559
That's great.
Really.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.355
Mom,
you're not telling the truth.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.607
You think his idea stinks.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.692
And it does.
I'm sorry, Uncle Terry,

08:45.692 --> 08:46.985
but it's terrible.

08:49.238 --> 08:52.115
Those are really
hurtful words, Beth.

08:52.115 --> 08:54.826
You could've said it
a lot nicer.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.411
- I didn't...
- Bye.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.914
...say them.

08:58.914 --> 09:01.250
Wyatt.
Why did you say that?

09:01.250 --> 09:03.085
I picked up on your tell.

09:03.085 --> 09:04.294
It's when you take
a deep breath.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.672
What...my tell?

09:06.672 --> 09:08.674
Never mind.
Honey, I just...

09:08.674 --> 09:11.343
...wish you hadn't said that.

09:11.343 --> 09:14.972
But we have to be honest, right?

09:14.972 --> 09:16.431
That's what you're always
telling us.

09:16.431 --> 09:20.560
Yeah, but not...always.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.145
It's complicated,

09:22.145 --> 09:23.897
and we are--we'll talk
about it later, okay?

09:23.897 --> 09:26.441
We're running late for school.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.737
So, Cathy posted
this photo, and I...

09:30.737 --> 09:32.739
Maya Fleishacker.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.575
I heard she's from New York
and used to ride the subway...

09:35.575 --> 09:38.203
by herself.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.664
I believe it.

09:40.664 --> 09:43.709
Uh-oh.
She's looking this way.

09:43.709 --> 09:45.460
That's it.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.254
That's her tell.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.464
What is she telling you?

09:49.464 --> 09:52.634
I don't know...yet.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.763
Could somebody get that?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.056
Hello

09:58.056 --> 09:59.766
I can, but I'm naked.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.601
Uh, no!
Tiffany, I got it, I got it.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.854
I got it.

10:07.441 --> 10:08.817
- Hello.
- Hi.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.902
I'm Arianna.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.321
I'm here to tutor Dash.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.781
Right, yes.
Please, come in, Arianna.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.743
Um...although, Arianna,
I need to apologize.

10:17.743 --> 10:20.078
When I called the school
to ask for a tutor,

10:20.078 --> 10:21.580
I just thought that we could...

10:24.416 --> 10:26.168
Dash, take those off.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.922
Whoa, that actually happened.

10:30.922 --> 10:33.050
Okay, Dash, this is Arianna.

10:33.050 --> 10:35.010
Yo.
Hey, you look familiar.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.137
I can't imagine why.
We've only been

10:37.137 --> 10:39.389
in the same class for two years.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.849
Maybe that's where
I've seen you.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.185
I hired Arianna
to tutor you in math.

10:43.185 --> 10:44.478
But, we, uh...we actually...

10:44.478 --> 10:46.563
we just can't anymore, so...

10:46.563 --> 10:48.357
I'm sorry.
I will totally

10:48.357 --> 10:49.900
pay you a little something
for your time.

10:49.900 --> 10:53.070
Oh, uh...actually,
I'm already here.

10:53.070 --> 10:55.864
If you want...
you don't have to pay me.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.407
Okay.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.992
I-I don't need
a math tutor.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.786
Besides, how good could she be
if she's free?

11:00.786 --> 11:02.371
Dash.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.747
- - Why don't you and Arianna

11:03.747 --> 11:06.750
go to the table, um,
and you can...

11:06.750 --> 11:08.543
learn something?

11:08.543 --> 11:10.170
Thank you.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.217
Didn't fit?

11:15.217 --> 11:16.760
Didn't fit my budget, honey.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.845
Don't even try to sell me
on store credit.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.555
Cash only.

11:20.555 --> 11:23.100
Uh, this one's stained.
Did someone wear it?

11:25.352 --> 11:26.353
Store credit's fine.

11:41.660 --> 11:44.538
So, it's good news.
The X-rays came back negative.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.665
No internal bleeding,
no broken bones.

11:46.665 --> 11:48.166
You should be good to go.

11:48.166 --> 11:51.920
Oh, that's wonderful news...
Dr. Scholls.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.172
Excuse me?
I'm Dr. Williams.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.091
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:56.091 --> 11:57.884
What did I say?
I...

11:57.884 --> 12:01.179
My head is really hurting
from the accident.

12:02.764 --> 12:05.183
Can you tell me
who the president is right now?

12:05.183 --> 12:08.145
Is it, um...

12:08.145 --> 12:09.688
BeyoncÃƒÂ©?

12:09.688 --> 12:11.273
Why don't we keep you here
a little longer

12:11.273 --> 12:12.691
and we'll run some more tests?

12:17.362 --> 12:18.822
Are you okay, Tiffany?

12:18.822 --> 12:21.116
Okay?
Look at me.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.868
I was the clean up
on aisle nine.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.244
That's the least
you have to worry about.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.704
Hospitals are a breeding grounds

12:25.704 --> 12:28.331
for deadly germs
and staph infections.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.791
We're probably all goners.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.168
Liam.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.627
Cool if I eat the Jell-o?

12:35.380 --> 12:36.631
Okay, hustle up, boys!

12:36.631 --> 12:39.050
Mom bus leaves in ten!

12:40.260 --> 12:42.012
yelps] Oh, God! Oh, oh...

12:42.012 --> 12:43.847
Oh...

12:45.348 --> 12:47.142
Craigslist.
That's where I found him.

12:47.142 --> 12:49.269
Or her.
Still not sure on that one.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.396
I guess they all pee
standing up, right?

12:51.396 --> 12:53.523
Anyway, this is a much better
idea than my surf shop.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.317
Don't say "I told you so."
We'll make a fortune.

12:55.317 --> 12:57.110
We'll charge neighborhood kids
five bucks a ride.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.904
Mm-hmm, and do you have
any idea

12:58.904 --> 13:02.282
how much it costs to house
and feed a llama?

13:04.493 --> 13:06.203
So we'll charge
six bucks a ride.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.787
Boom.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.332
Whoa, that is
a freaky-looking horse.

13:10.332 --> 13:12.834
And here's our client base now.
Why don't we ask them?

13:12.834 --> 13:14.961
Gentle-sirs,
how much would you shell out

13:14.961 --> 13:16.588
to ride this lovely llama?

13:16.588 --> 13:18.632
Nothing.
Llamas are a poor man's camel.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.091
- Oh.
- If I could ride

13:20.091 --> 13:21.760
that thing to school,
I would give you

13:21.760 --> 13:23.428
everything I got.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.347
There you have it.
50% of kids love it

13:25.347 --> 13:26.473
100% of the time.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.724
Boom and boom.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.897
Okay, you...school?

13:33.897 --> 13:35.565
Let's go, let's go.
Now. Move.

13:35.565 --> 13:40.070
Let's go.
We will talk about this later.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.030
Yeah, the three of us can
have a conversation.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.323
Scooter, come on.
Let's go upstairs.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.866
Let's go see your room.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.576
Okay,
so if "A" equals two

13:46.576 --> 13:48.119
and "B" equals three,
and "A" plus "B"

13:48.119 --> 13:49.871
equals "C,"
then what does "C" equal?

13:53.458 --> 13:57.337
Math is numbers, not letters.
Even I know that.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.922
I need a Slim Jim.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.011
I didn't see it at first.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.596
You're good,

14:06.596 --> 14:09.015
but your tell is that
you blink a lot.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.267
What are you talking about?

14:10.267 --> 14:12.060
You like my brother.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.854
That's why you're
tutoring him for free.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.731
Are you nuts?

14:23.280 --> 14:24.781
Okay, fine.
Maybe I like him a little.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.741
I knew it.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.952
Why don't you just tell him?

14:28.952 --> 14:30.912
I don't know,
what if I tell him the truth

14:30.912 --> 14:32.831
and he doesn't want me
to come over anymore?

14:32.831 --> 14:34.457
He already doesn't want you
to come over

14:34.457 --> 14:35.834
because you make him think.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.088
Hi, Arianna.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.131
So, how's Dash doing?

14:41.131 --> 14:42.799
Really, really well.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.385
Yeah, he's totally got
a head for numbers.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.137
Great.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.555
Hm.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.417
What the...

15:23.673 --> 15:26.217
Well, well, well.

15:26.217 --> 15:29.012
If it isn't Wyatt Earp.

15:29.012 --> 15:32.515
It's more like Wyatt... Burp.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.028
- Check.
- I check too.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.781
Do you have any sevens?

15:47.781 --> 15:50.784
We're not playing Go Fish, Sam.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.285
What are you doing here?

15:52.285 --> 15:55.372
I don't know.
I'm kind of scared.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.748
I think I just peed a little.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.502
Hey, can I do that too?

16:00.502 --> 16:01.795
I have a test to study for,

16:01.795 --> 16:02.796
and frankly, I don't even know

16:02.796 --> 16:04.422
why I'm here.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.928
I bet 50 chips.

16:09.928 --> 16:12.931
Anybody got the baked beans
to call?

16:12.931 --> 16:14.474
I'm all in.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.309
Good luck trying
to read me, Wyatt.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.144
I'm a riddle wrapped up
in a Rubik's cube

16:18.144 --> 16:19.979
with all the colors removed.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.986
I fold.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.656
Ha!
I got nothing.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.160
You're all a bunch
of no-good fibbers.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.165
I'm right, aren't I?

16:39.165 --> 16:41.835
Shouldn't you always
tell the truth?

16:41.835 --> 16:44.838
Everybody is telling me
something different.

16:44.838 --> 16:48.174
Normally a good philosophy, son.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.718
But life is tricky.

16:49.718 --> 16:52.345
Sometimes you gotta
tell the truth.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.390
Sometimes...you gotta bluff.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.144
Nothing makes sense.

17:07.277 --> 17:09.445
Now that's gonna go viral.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.075
- - Our in-house Plethora Law team

17:14.075 --> 17:16.786
has taken care of the plethora
of medical bills, of course.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.329
The store has
their own legal department?

17:19.329 --> 17:21.458
Yes, ma'am.
It's right next to housewares.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.667
Now...Plethora would like
to offer you

17:23.667 --> 17:25.377
this very generous
cash settlement.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.132
- - I know that money

17:29.132 --> 17:30.467
is small compensation
for the suffering--

17:30.467 --> 17:31.509
No, it helps.
It helps.

17:31.509 --> 17:32.552
It does help.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.805
Do you need time
to think this over?

17:35.805 --> 17:37.640
No, I think it best
we just settle this

17:37.640 --> 17:40.018
- and all move on. I appreciate that,

17:40.018 --> 17:42.520
as will my plethora
of superiors.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.482
Here are the papers
I will need you to sign.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.872
You must be really worried
about your grandmother.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.796
Uh...oh, yeah, right.

18:07.796 --> 18:09.047
Like...

18:09.047 --> 18:11.508
...with all the injuries and...

18:11.508 --> 18:13.301
...the skull damage.

18:13.301 --> 18:16.679
Doctor said she might need
a replacement...head.

18:21.392 --> 18:23.561
It's okay, Wyatt.

18:23.561 --> 18:24.938
You don't have to do that.

18:27.148 --> 18:30.777
Mrs. Chen, I...

18:30.777 --> 18:32.737
I was at Woodstock, so...

18:32.737 --> 18:34.614
I probably do have
some brain damage.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.283
But...it wasn't
from the accident.

18:39.786 --> 18:40.870
I can't take your money.

18:42.789 --> 18:43.790
I see.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.460
Well, Mrs. McKenna,
a plethora of thanks

18:47.460 --> 18:49.212
for your honesty.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.589
Just sign here,
agreeing to

18:51.589 --> 18:53.716
a no-cash settlement,
and we'll be done.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.563
You should learn
to be more honest,

19:06.563 --> 19:07.480
like your grandmother.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.364
I'm sorry, Tiffany.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.116
No.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.868
I'm sorry.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.787
Oh, God.

19:24.455 --> 19:26.541
We're just gonna have to
figure out another way

19:26.541 --> 19:27.792
to help out your mom.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.546
Yeah.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.320
Welcome back
to the final table

19:55.320 --> 19:57.655
of the World Championships
of Poker.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.450
Got a real murderer's row
of poker greats here.

20:00.450 --> 20:05.538
our chip leader, Wyatt McKenna.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.665
Is the remaining field
gonna gang up

20:07.665 --> 20:09.167
on little Wyatt?

20:09.167 --> 20:10.418
"Wyatt" not?

20:10.418 --> 20:11.502
- - I would.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.254
That's poker.

20:13.254 --> 20:16.633
All right,
let's shuffle up and deal!

20:16.633 --> 20:19.844
Dad, this is for all the money.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.387
- Mom needs it.
- Put together

20:21.387 --> 20:23.306
everything you've learned.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.725
You can do it.
I believe in you, son.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.040
A full house.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.459
Aces high.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.711
A gritty play
by boy wonder.

20:53.711 --> 20:56.005
McKenna continues to impress.

20:56.005 --> 20:59.133
He is, without a doubt,
the very best player

20:59.133 --> 21:03.346
who ever sat down
at a poker table, period.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.056
Hey, it's his fantasy.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.557
He can have me say
anything he wants.

21:10.770 --> 21:14.524
Unbelievable bluff
by McKenna!

21:14.524 --> 21:16.484
And another one bites the dust.

21:16.484 --> 21:18.528
The Ohio Tornado.

21:18.528 --> 21:20.029
The Akron Assassin.

21:20.029 --> 21:22.323
The Midwestern Maniac.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.825
- Are you trying out nicknames?
- Yeah,

21:23.825 --> 21:25.702
- I gotta see what sticks.
- Sure.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.620
You're cute as a button.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.455
I'd hate you...

21:29.455 --> 21:31.332
if I didn't
wanna babysit you.

21:34.043 --> 21:36.004
We've come to the end.

21:36.004 --> 21:38.715
It's heads up play between
rookie sensation Wyatt McKenna

21:38.715 --> 21:41.300
and two-time world champion
Nick Nelson,

21:41.300 --> 21:43.302
the Nasty Nerd of Poker.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.513
One of these two players will

21:45.513 --> 21:47.140
become the world champion
of poker.

21:49.392 --> 21:52.353
Oh, and Nick Nelson has
moved all in.

21:54.022 --> 21:56.441
Sitting on a monster hand, Nick?

21:56.441 --> 21:58.568
It's all up to you, son.

21:58.568 --> 21:59.819
What are you gonna do?

22:02.113 --> 22:03.948
Take your time, Wyatt.

22:10.788 --> 22:11.622
I call.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.419
And that's it!
It's over!

22:16.419 --> 22:20.631
Wyatt McKenna has just upset
the entire poker world!

22:20.631 --> 22:22.258
The Akron Assassin wins

22:22.258 --> 22:25.970
the World Championships
of Poker!

22:25.970 --> 22:27.555
- He did it!
-

22:27.555 --> 22:29.474
- The little guy did it.
- The little, tiny guy.

22:29.474 --> 22:31.392
Right? He's a little guy.
But he sure did do it.

22:31.392 --> 22:32.477
He's a little guy, you know?

22:33.770 --> 22:35.354
A pair of fours?

22:35.354 --> 22:38.107
What kind of lunatic
makes a call like that?

22:38.107 --> 22:39.358
This is ridiculous!
I can't believe...

22:39.358 --> 22:41.360
I'm so proud of you, son.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.029
This isn't fair.
I never...

22:43.029 --> 22:45.573
How did you figure out
he was bluffing?

22:45.573 --> 22:47.950
I caught his tell.
Look at him.

22:47.950 --> 22:50.161
The Nasty Nerd of Poker.

22:50.161 --> 22:53.539
Why?
Wyatt...

22:53.539 --> 22:55.416
Hey, this is pretty cute.

22:57.335 --> 22:59.170
Oops.

22:59.170 --> 23:02.840
The second he said
"take your time" so politely,

23:02.840 --> 23:03.966
I knew he was bluffing.

23:05.593 --> 23:08.846
That's great.
You figured it out, Wyatt.

23:08.846 --> 23:11.057
How to know when
you're being bluffed

23:11.057 --> 23:12.308
and how to know when you need

23:12.308 --> 23:14.060
to pull a bluff
of your own.

23:23.111 --> 23:26.322
I would like
you to sign each page and

23:26.322 --> 23:29.117
initial in the place
where I have circled.

23:29.117 --> 23:30.701
Okay. And a copy

23:30.701 --> 23:33.121
for you, a copy for me,
and we'll...

23:33.121 --> 23:35.456
Okay, all set.
So...

23:35.456 --> 23:38.167
just make sure
you date it there.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.545
What's done is done.

23:40.545 --> 23:42.088
It's important not to

23:42.088 --> 23:44.465
be underinsured again,
Mrs. McKenna.

23:44.465 --> 23:47.009
Yes, thank you.
I understand.

23:47.009 --> 23:49.345
Uh, I'd say call
if you need anything,

23:49.345 --> 23:51.931
but, uh...

23:51.931 --> 23:54.267
I ran over my phone, so...

23:57.979 --> 23:59.438
Thank you.

24:04.527 --> 24:07.363
What am I gonna do?

24:07.363 --> 24:08.281
Mom?

24:11.117 --> 24:12.910
Are you okay?

24:12.910 --> 24:14.662
Yeah.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.080
I'm okay.
Yeah.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.374
You can be honest with me.

24:20.168 --> 24:21.794
Did you hear all of that?

24:21.794 --> 24:24.338
Um...maybe.

24:24.338 --> 24:26.966
Yeah.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.844
It's my fault.

24:29.844 --> 24:31.637
I took care of the bills,
and the insurance,

24:31.637 --> 24:34.891
it was my responsibility,
and now...

24:34.891 --> 24:36.559
It's okay.

24:36.559 --> 24:39.103
No, but it's not.
Wyatt, I know it's not.

24:39.103 --> 24:40.188
- We gotta...
- Mom.

24:40.188 --> 24:44.025
Everything is going to be great.

24:45.276 --> 24:49.113
How can you be
so sure of that?

24:49.113 --> 24:53.117
Because...I just know.

24:53.117 --> 24:54.827
I promise.

24:56.454 --> 24:58.915
Oh, sweetheart.

24:58.915 --> 25:00.166
Oh, thank you.

25:03.127 --> 25:04.587
Oh, I needed that.

25:08.966 --> 25:10.509
Okay.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.678
Uh...will you go
find your brothers?

25:12.678 --> 25:14.931
Set the table for dinner?

25:26.609 --> 25:28.194
Hey-- Man, you're slow!

25:28.194 --> 25:30.988
- I'm gonna catch you! Ow...

25:35.493 --> 25:37.870
Arianna!
I got a D on my math test.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.038
Um...

25:39.038 --> 25:40.331
I've never gotten a D before.

25:40.331 --> 25:43.042
This is amazing.
Thanks, Arianna.

25:56.681 --> 25:57.890
Hey.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.267
- Maya.
- Oh.

25:59.267 --> 26:01.310
- Hi.
- Here's the thing.

26:01.310 --> 26:04.438
You're new in school.
Probably a little shy.

26:04.438 --> 26:05.564
My name's Wyatt.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.275
Let's cut to the chase.

26:07.275 --> 26:10.444
We will definitely be going
to the dance together.

26:10.444 --> 26:11.821
How awesome is that?

26:11.821 --> 26:14.115
See, I spotted your tell.

26:14.115 --> 26:15.866
The way you run your fingers
through your hair

26:15.866 --> 26:17.493
when you look at me?

26:17.493 --> 26:19.161
It means you like me.

26:19.161 --> 26:21.247
Like, a lot.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.165
First of all Ryan,
or Wade,

26:23.165 --> 26:25.710
or whatever you said
your name is,

26:25.710 --> 26:27.920
I'm not going to
any dance with you.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.548
And FYI,
I'm messing with my hair

26:30.548 --> 26:33.217
because some idiot brought
head lice to school

26:33.217 --> 26:35.761
and now I think I have it.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.722
It was probably you.

26:37.722 --> 26:38.931
You jerk!

26:43.978 --> 26:45.438
She touched me.

26:46.305 --> 26:52.345
