00:53.262 --> 00:56.504
A truck driver making
a delivery found him.

00:57.672 --> 00:58.807
TOD?

00:58.873 --> 01:00.267
About two or three hours ago.

01:01.836 --> 01:03.543
Neck contusion.

01:04.980 --> 01:06.948
Looks like he went down fighting.

01:07.012 --> 01:08.699
Any ID?

01:09.061 --> 01:10.419
Just this.

01:12.769 --> 01:14.594
Palermo room key.

01:14.628 --> 01:16.419
Nice clothes.

01:16.484 --> 01:17.944
Well, they do make the man.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.414
He's got some kind of
transfer on his pants.

01:21.479 --> 01:23.489
Yeah, and on his shirt.

01:23.553 --> 01:25.748
So what's a guy dressed for a party

01:25.782 --> 01:28.970
with a key to this hotel doing out here?

01:29.036 --> 01:30.527
I don't know.

01:30.592 --> 01:33.689
But the party's over.

02:07.833 --> 02:10.305
Got smudges that look
like white paint up here.

02:10.372 --> 02:12.731
Similar to the trace
on the vic's clothes.

02:12.848 --> 02:14.512
Same down here.

02:14.716 --> 02:18.793
So whatever it is,
it must have been wet.

02:30.901 --> 02:34.729
I don't see any wet paint
signs up here either.

03:20.136 --> 03:22.007
<i>Two performances nightly</i>

03:22.074 --> 03:24.060
<i>of Palermo's fabulous
show, "The Girls of India".</i>

03:27.768 --> 03:29.223
<i>Now on display at Palermo Jewelers...</i>

03:29.291 --> 03:32.201
<i>Diamonds at Romanoff's.</i>

03:37.854 --> 03:40.841
The room is registered to a Jeffrey
Powell of Van Nuys, California.

03:40.876 --> 03:42.353
He check in with anybody?

03:42.388 --> 03:44.466
No. The reservation was for one person.

03:44.501 --> 03:45.810
He checked in yesterday,

03:45.845 --> 03:47.901
paid with a corporate credit card.

03:47.968 --> 03:49.436
Do you remember the name of the company?

03:49.471 --> 03:50.875
Sheritown Inc.

03:50.942 --> 03:51.878
Sheritown Inc.

03:51.945 --> 03:53.481
We're going to need access

03:53.548 --> 03:56.522
to all of the surveillance
footage from tonight, all right?

03:56.589 --> 03:58.559
You got it. Okay.

04:03.220 --> 04:04.675
Two glasses.

04:04.741 --> 04:06.645
Think our vic got lucky?

04:06.712 --> 04:09.118
Oh, yeah.

04:10.922 --> 04:12.927
He got lucky, all right.

04:12.994 --> 04:14.832
He got lucky

04:14.899 --> 04:16.803
with a blonde.

04:21.012 --> 04:22.382
Jeans...

04:23.070 --> 04:24.554
full of holes.

04:25.435 --> 04:27.527
Must have been wearing them a long time.

04:27.595 --> 04:30.736
Either that or he just
bought them an paid a fortune.

04:32.044 --> 04:33.743
I remember my first time to Vegas.

04:34.957 --> 04:35.981
I got one of these...

04:36.048 --> 04:37.618
Guide to blackjack.

04:38.398 --> 04:41.293
Everybody dreams of hitting
it big out here, don't they?

04:41.360 --> 04:44.235
Yeah, well, if that ever ends
you can kiss Vegas good-bye.

04:46.907 --> 04:48.577
We have a winner.

04:50.548 --> 04:52.386
Jackpot.

04:52.453 --> 04:54.625
Ooh, Sasan.

04:54.691 --> 04:57.231
Cost him more than all of his
other clothes put together.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.837
There's some kind of blue powder trace

04:59.904 --> 05:02.577
on the pocket.

05:03.847 --> 05:05.416
Nicky, take this.

05:09.745 --> 05:10.863
California driver's license.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.238
Company credit card.

05:14.305 --> 05:17.612
Amateur Speedway Association card.

05:18.351 --> 05:19.884
Guy liked fast cars.

05:23.623 --> 05:25.363
Except he was driving a Toyota.

05:25.430 --> 05:26.767
No cash.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.808
This sounds like a classic trick roll.

05:30.969 --> 05:32.714
Kid from out of town
on a lucky streak...

05:33.778 --> 05:35.187
he's an easy mark.

05:35.254 --> 05:38.962
Get him up to the room...

05:39.029 --> 05:41.534
loosen him up...

05:41.601 --> 05:43.908
jump him and dump him.

05:56.304 --> 05:57.439
Mom was right...

05:57.506 --> 05:58.699
always wear clean ones.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.495
Because you never
know what could happen.

06:00.530 --> 06:02.483
What do you think that is?

06:02.551 --> 06:03.504
Why don't you take a whiff?

06:03.539 --> 06:06.428
Why am I always the guy
who has to sniff the shorts?

06:06.493 --> 06:07.797
'Cause it's your job.

06:07.863 --> 06:09.200
You do it.

06:14.646 --> 06:16.684
Red wine.

06:18.660 --> 06:21.028
It's not on his pants.

06:21.095 --> 06:21.779
What about the shirt?

06:21.814 --> 06:23.749
No.

06:24.074 --> 06:26.207
So he must have changed after the mess.

06:26.840 --> 06:29.080
Oh, I already went through his pockets.

06:32.167 --> 06:34.359
Of course, I was double-gloved.

06:35.283 --> 06:36.931
Clothes are brand new.

06:42.178 --> 06:44.283
Looks like a callus.

06:47.357 --> 06:48.959
There's a long-haired blonde.

06:48.994 --> 06:52.268
Yeah, I've been watching
this for a while now.

06:52.335 --> 06:56.043
Time stamped 10:52 p. m.

06:56.110 --> 06:58.225
He entered his room a
couple of minutes later.

06:58.260 --> 07:00.341
Manager said the last
time he used his card key

07:00.376 --> 07:03.160
was 10:54 p. m.

07:03.227 --> 07:07.203
We look forward about an hour...

07:07.270 --> 07:09.943
Jeff leaves his room alone.

07:10.009 --> 07:11.446
He doesn't have a jacket on.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.485
He's probably not going too far.

07:13.551 --> 07:17.827
So he gets off the elevator,
goes into the casino,

07:17.895 --> 07:19.499
and nine minutes later,

07:19.566 --> 07:21.804
same blonde goes down in the elevator.

07:23.708 --> 07:25.846
Grab that.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.651
Print that.

07:29.489 --> 07:31.995
After the vic gets off the elevator,

07:32.061 --> 07:33.598
I lose him in the casino crowd

07:33.665 --> 07:34.667
for about 15 minutes.

07:34.734 --> 07:36.372
How do you lose him?

07:36.438 --> 07:37.875
Aren't there a hundred cameras in there?

07:37.942 --> 07:39.445
And at four hours of video each,

07:39.512 --> 07:41.995
that's 400 hours of
video I got to go through.

07:43.221 --> 07:44.991
The vic was found at the loading dock

07:45.058 --> 07:47.231
off the shopping arcade.

07:47.298 --> 07:48.800
He's heading for the arcade here.

07:48.867 --> 07:51.005
That's the last time
I've got him on camera.

07:51.040 --> 07:53.144
There's no surveillance
in the arcade hall.

07:53.212 --> 07:55.182
Only in the individual stores.

07:55.834 --> 07:57.187
Freeze that.

07:57.254 --> 08:00.127
Enhance that bag.

08:01.772 --> 08:04.235
The vic was wearing a Sasan jacket.

08:04.771 --> 08:06.309
Uh, check this out!

08:06.344 --> 08:07.978
Bingo!

08:07.979 --> 08:09.575
I'm going shopping.

08:11.183 --> 08:13.057
But you were working last night.

08:13.124 --> 08:15.230
Yeah, we've been short-handed.

08:15.265 --> 08:18.060
Do you, uh, do you recognize
either one of these people?

08:21.645 --> 08:23.382
No. Sorry.

08:25.012 --> 08:26.539
How about this?

08:26.574 --> 08:28.030
Recognize that?

08:28.065 --> 08:31.100
Sure. That's from the new Spring line.

08:31.167 --> 08:33.908
The leather's like
skin. It's incredible.

08:34.241 --> 08:35.644
Show me that picture again.

08:39.159 --> 08:41.256
Now I remember.

08:41.325 --> 08:42.660
He bought a whole outfit.

08:42.727 --> 08:44.598
Even wanted underwear.

08:44.665 --> 08:46.336
We don't sell underwear.

08:46.403 --> 08:48.874
Credit card receipt, anything like that?

08:48.941 --> 08:49.977
He paid cash.

08:50.044 --> 08:51.381
He was flashing a wad.

08:52.878 --> 08:54.053
Buy anything for her?

08:54.680 --> 08:55.858
Nothing.

08:55.925 --> 08:56.742
She didn't need anything.

08:56.777 --> 08:58.173
Looked perfect.

08:58.208 --> 09:00.152
Was making my job real easy.

09:05.982 --> 09:07.223
That guy would have bought anything

09:07.259 --> 09:09.289
she wanted him to, Mr. Stokes.

09:12.531 --> 09:13.801
Thank you.

09:32.879 --> 09:35.820
I found extensive contusion

09:35.886 --> 09:39.527
involving the anterior
aspect of the neck

09:39.594 --> 09:41.499
with hemorrhage in
all the strap muscles.

09:41.566 --> 09:43.001
The thyroid, cricoid

09:43.069 --> 09:46.343
and arytenoid cartilages
are all multiply fractured.

09:49.919 --> 09:52.357
The hyoid bone is fractured as well.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.011
The blunt-force trauma to the neck?

09:54.046 --> 09:58.605
Yeah. COD is asphyxiation due
to obstruction of the airway.

09:58.606 --> 09:59.487
Took a few minutes to die.

09:59.522 --> 10:01.762
Any idea of the source of the BFT?

10:01.797 --> 10:04.067
Well, I enhanced the
contusion on the neck

10:04.102 --> 10:06.190
using UV photography.

10:06.747 --> 10:09.998
Looks like there's a
defined edge on the weapon.

10:10.132 --> 10:12.238
Yeah, that could be anything.

10:12.893 --> 10:14.603
How about prelim tox results?

10:14.638 --> 10:19.651
Well, tox detected methamphetamine,
sildenafil and oxycodone.

10:19.697 --> 10:22.453
Stimulant, erection and a painkiller.

10:22.488 --> 10:23.627
Party in a pill.

10:23.662 --> 10:26.373
Where was that on my wedding night?

10:29.508 --> 10:31.182
Does this couple look familiar?

10:31.249 --> 10:33.287
Sweet red Ferrari. F-360 Spyder.

10:33.354 --> 10:34.273
When did you see them?

10:34.308 --> 10:36.394
Last night... I brought
the car when they left.

10:36.461 --> 10:37.831
Around 8:15.

10:37.866 --> 10:39.204
They're gone a couple hours.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.541
The car... pfft... was amazing.

10:40.649 --> 10:42.375
Did they happen to tell
you where they were going?

10:42.442 --> 10:43.194
No.

10:43.229 --> 10:45.281
Do you know what time
they got back to the hotel?

10:45.316 --> 10:46.638
Uh, a little after 10:00.

10:46.673 --> 10:47.979
The guy gave me a Benjamin.

10:48.014 --> 10:49.250
I kept an eye out on that baby,

10:49.285 --> 10:51.469
I didn't want any of these other
maniacs putting their paws on it.

10:52.324 --> 10:53.936
What about the girl?

10:54.003 --> 10:55.640
You ever seen her before?

10:55.706 --> 10:57.143
I don't think so.

10:57.210 --> 10:59.147
She strike you as a working girl?

10:59.215 --> 11:00.236
I'll say this, if she was hooking,

11:00.271 --> 11:02.422
then she was top shelf,
just like that car.

11:02.422 --> 11:03.924
I felt kind of like that garage guy

11:03.991 --> 11:05.709
in Ferris Bueller's Day Off?

11:05.745 --> 11:06.876
You know, he likes the car so much,

11:06.911 --> 11:10.009
he takes it out for a spin
for, like, the whole day.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.541
Not that I'd ever do that.

11:11.607 --> 11:13.479
Of course not.

11:13.546 --> 11:14.838
Whoa, look, I had nothing to do

11:14.873 --> 11:16.131
with the damage on that car.

11:19.759 --> 11:21.330
I mean, it was pristine
before they took it out.

11:21.397 --> 11:24.204
They were in an accident? How bad?

11:24.270 --> 11:26.883
Look, any scratch on
that beauty is a tragedy.

11:26.918 --> 11:28.947
And this was, like, a dent.

11:29.067 --> 11:31.152
You know what? They looked
like they didn't even care.

11:31.219 --> 11:33.157
Anything else I can do for you?

11:33.224 --> 11:35.005
Um, thanks.

11:35.040 --> 11:37.139
Lenny. Lenny Andretti.

11:37.174 --> 11:38.752
No relation.

11:38.870 --> 11:41.076
The trace for your vic's jacket pocket

11:41.143 --> 11:42.512
was primarily talc.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.709
Blue baby powder?

11:44.744 --> 11:46.841
No. Take a look.

11:48.288 --> 11:51.165
Birefringent crystals.

11:51.231 --> 11:53.602
Pretty. What are they?

11:53.669 --> 11:55.774
It's a mixture of silica and axolite,

11:55.841 --> 11:56.459
two abrasives.

11:56.494 --> 12:00.252
But when found with talc,
it suggests only one use.

12:00.905 --> 12:02.458
And that would be?

12:02.524 --> 12:05.516
In 1897, William
Spinks received a patent

12:05.551 --> 12:08.357
for what came to be known
as "Spinks Billiard Chalk".

12:09.230 --> 12:11.876
You may be surprised to
know that cue-tip chalk

12:11.911 --> 12:13.303
does not contain chalk at all,

12:13.338 --> 12:16.446
it is a mixture of axolite and silica.

12:16.788 --> 12:20.931
The abrasives give grip to
the tip when it hits the ball.

12:21.831 --> 12:23.671
Stop trying to make that sound dirty.

12:23.738 --> 12:26.357
Out vic had a callus on his hand.

12:26.642 --> 12:27.581
Don't.

12:28.006 --> 12:30.286
Which means that he was
probably playing a lot of pool.

12:30.309 --> 12:32.402
Where do you go in
this town to shoot stick

12:32.437 --> 12:34.563
with a hot blonde and a Ferrari?

12:39.600 --> 12:40.409
There's at least a half a dozen

12:40.476 --> 12:42.514
of these high-end pool halls in Vegas.

12:43.114 --> 12:43.795
The word on the street is

12:43.831 --> 12:46.434
a lot of out-of-town
money comes through here.

12:46.647 --> 12:49.194
Well, it's closer to Palermo,
it's a good place to start.

13:07.635 --> 13:09.771
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

13:09.806 --> 13:11.907
Have these two been in lately?

13:13.471 --> 13:14.380
No.

13:14.447 --> 13:15.321
It's pretty dark in here,

13:15.356 --> 13:17.494
wouldn't recognize my
own mom if she came in.

13:17.562 --> 13:19.035
It wasn't so dark you
couldn't count your vig

13:19.102 --> 13:20.577
from that game over there.

13:20.642 --> 13:23.020
It's not illegal to bet
on a pool game in Nevada.

13:23.088 --> 13:26.320
But it is illegal for the house to
take a cut without a gaming license.

13:26.505 --> 13:29.150
I don't see one on the wall.

13:29.216 --> 13:31.174
That's because nothing
like that's going on here.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.133
So, if we asked everyone
in here, no one would say

13:33.168 --> 13:35.006
that you're taking a
piece of the action?

13:36.643 --> 13:37.986
Let me take another look.

13:38.022 --> 13:39.332
Sure. Knock yourself out.

13:39.399 --> 13:41.106
I never seen the guy.

13:41.173 --> 13:42.346
Girl's kind of a regular here.

13:42.413 --> 13:43.257
Name's Heidi.

13:43.292 --> 13:45.696
So, I guess your eyes
do get used to the dark.

13:45.761 --> 13:47.604
You know where we can find this Heidi?

13:47.671 --> 13:48.308
Oh, man...

13:48.343 --> 13:50.580
You know, I don't see
that license anywhere.

13:50.616 --> 13:51.823
Look, here's what we're going to do.

13:51.890 --> 13:52.547
Get on the phone.

13:52.582 --> 13:53.370
Call Heidi.

13:53.405 --> 13:55.612
Tell her a distinguished
gentleman has just come in

13:55.647 --> 13:57.818
with a large wad of cash
looking for some action.

13:57.885 --> 13:59.427
That'd be me.

14:09.474 --> 14:10.446
Heidi Wolff?

14:10.512 --> 14:11.362
How you doing?

14:11.397 --> 14:13.031
I'm Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.

14:13.066 --> 14:14.665
Can I talk to you for a minute?

14:15.041 --> 14:16.474
About what?

14:17.345 --> 14:18.349
Do you know this guy?

14:19.522 --> 14:20.559
No.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.043
Apparently, you think I do.

14:22.078 --> 14:24.144
Oh, I know you do.

14:24.210 --> 14:27.003
You want to tell me
how he turned up dead?

14:34.083 --> 14:35.651
So you spent the night with Jeff Powell.

14:35.685 --> 14:38.183
And he was alive when he left me.

14:38.218 --> 14:40.215
Oh. He left you?

14:40.250 --> 14:42.879
Yeah. Believe it or not.

14:42.945 --> 14:44.268
Look.

14:44.896 --> 14:47.156
He was getting kind of weird on me.

14:49.924 --> 14:50.849
Hey.

14:50.916 --> 14:51.974
Where you going?

14:52.008 --> 14:54.157
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

14:54.222 --> 14:56.933
You know, I think I may just
have to fall in love with you.

15:00.832 --> 15:04.119
So I put on my clothes
and I got out of there.

15:04.153 --> 15:07.407
I was looking for fun,
not a lifetime commitment.

15:08.529 --> 15:09.990
Is that what you call fun?

15:10.024 --> 15:12.205
Rolling a guy, taking his money?

15:12.239 --> 15:14.428
I didn't take his money.

15:14.493 --> 15:16.379
Heidi, Heidi, ho.

15:18.605 --> 15:22.133
Look, we know Jeff was waving
around a large wedge of cash.

15:22.198 --> 15:24.474
And the money was
gone when we found him.

15:24.508 --> 15:26.409
You're an expensive date, Heidi.

15:26.443 --> 15:28.288
I'm a professional gambler.

15:28.323 --> 15:31.166
Probably the only one in Vegas
who declares every dollar.

15:31.201 --> 15:33.046
You can check my tax returns.

15:33.111 --> 15:35.426
We checked the hotel sheets.

15:36.652 --> 15:38.291
We had sex.

15:38.327 --> 15:40.363
Is that against the law? No.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.181
No.

15:41.215 --> 15:43.579
We won some money shooting pool.

15:43.613 --> 15:45.942
Is that against the law? No.

15:45.977 --> 15:47.092
You gave him drugs.

15:47.127 --> 15:48.854
Is that against the law?

15:51.012 --> 15:52.326
Yeah.

15:52.556 --> 15:54.961
Look, here's the way
I see it breaking down.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.367
You left the room nine
minutes after he did.

15:57.401 --> 15:59.004
You went downstairs.

15:59.038 --> 16:00.972
You checked with your partner.

16:01.007 --> 16:03.192
You killed the kid, you took the cash,

16:03.227 --> 16:05.196
end of story.

16:05.263 --> 16:06.576
Let's get this straight.

16:06.611 --> 16:09.503
He was a sweet kid and
I'm sorry he's dead,

16:09.539 --> 16:11.161
but I had nothing to do with it.

16:11.756 --> 16:13.636
And I'm done talking.

16:14.298 --> 16:15.734
According to the DMV,

16:15.769 --> 16:18.656
of the 12 Ferrari F-360
Spyders registered in Vegas,

16:18.691 --> 16:19.774
only three are red.

16:19.809 --> 16:21.326
Two of them are privately owned,

16:21.361 --> 16:23.269
and a rental company has the third.

16:23.304 --> 16:24.929
Since the vic owns a Toyota in L.A.

16:24.964 --> 16:26.518
and Heidi Wolff drives a Beetle...

16:26.554 --> 16:28.606
You figured this would
be a good place to start.

16:28.641 --> 16:30.794
Welcome to Extravagant Auto.

16:30.830 --> 16:31.832
Robert Rhoda.

16:31.867 --> 16:33.622
If what you're dreaming
about's on four wheels,

16:33.657 --> 16:34.402
I can get it for you.

16:34.437 --> 16:37.461
Actually, we're looking
for a red Ferrari Spyder.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.010
The lady likes fast cars.

16:39.045 --> 16:40.981
And I just happen to have one.

16:41.049 --> 16:42.498
But it got into a little fender-bender,

16:42.533 --> 16:44.822
so it's going to take a
day or so to get it fixed.

16:47.442 --> 16:49.868
We'll take it as is.

16:50.413 --> 16:52.640
Looks like paint transfer
on the left rear quarter.

16:53.050 --> 16:55.864
Clear coat's been
peeled front-to-back.

16:55.899 --> 16:58.971
Which means the Ferrari
was the faster vehicle.

16:59.006 --> 17:01.730
The Ferrari is always
the faster vehicle.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.112
Ooh.

17:08.178 --> 17:11.652
Nice dent to the front bumper.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.491
You're looking at
$15,000 of damage there.

17:13.557 --> 17:15.095
Who rented it?

17:15.162 --> 17:16.449
Can't help you with that.

17:16.483 --> 17:19.303
Our customer records are confidential.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.974
In any case, we're not
making a police report

17:21.041 --> 17:22.211
about the damage.

17:22.277 --> 17:24.849
No need to, we're impounding it.

17:25.394 --> 17:25.932
What?

17:25.967 --> 17:28.419
Looks like the interior's been cleaned.

17:28.818 --> 17:32.029
I'll call auto transport and
have them tow it back to the lot.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.077
Mr. Rhoda, what are you doing?

17:36.144 --> 17:39.084
I'm documenting my loss.

17:39.151 --> 17:41.723
I'm filing for crime
victim compensation.

18:53.826 --> 18:54.442
Grissom...

18:54.477 --> 18:56.401
Hodges confirmed the paint transfer

18:56.436 --> 18:59.240
on the Ferrari is a
black acrylic enamel.

18:59.275 --> 19:00.490
That doesn't narrow it down much.

19:00.525 --> 19:01.200
Well, it gets better.

19:01.235 --> 19:05.073
It's a GM paint, with traces of
fiberglass reinforced plastic.

19:05.108 --> 19:07.594
Which means, we're looking
for a black Corvette.

19:07.629 --> 19:09.836
I'll have Brass put out a broadcast.

19:09.871 --> 19:11.525
Nick ran the vic's credit card.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.351
"Sheritown, Inc. " is based in L.A.,

19:13.386 --> 19:15.155
run by a guy named Mick Sheridan.

19:15.190 --> 19:16.924
I'm going to meet him at the P.D.

19:16.959 --> 19:18.624
Mick Sheridan the movie producer?

19:18.659 --> 19:21.366
I grew up watching his
action blockbusters...

19:21.401 --> 19:24.074
car chases, ninjas,
cyborg death machines.

19:24.109 --> 19:26.048
We used to make body armor

19:26.083 --> 19:28.921
out of tinfoil, and re-enact the
scenes all over the neighborhood.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.055
What about you, you
were a Green Beret kid?

19:31.090 --> 19:31.951
Secret agent?

19:31.986 --> 19:32.777
I'm not telling.

19:32.812 --> 19:35.232
And stay away from my tinfoil.

19:39.051 --> 19:40.901
I'm sick about this.

19:41.794 --> 19:44.036
Of all kids.

19:44.072 --> 19:45.656
Jeff.

19:46.892 --> 19:48.840
I can't stop crying.

19:49.056 --> 19:50.826
You want something to drink?

19:50.894 --> 19:52.464
Oh, thanks, uh...

19:52.531 --> 19:54.609
Small Pellegrino, room temperature.

20:00.717 --> 20:05.039
Mr. Sheridan, can you tell
us anything about this girl?

20:06.764 --> 20:07.932
I don't know her.

20:07.967 --> 20:10.273
Jeff must have met her here.

20:11.706 --> 20:14.032
I loved him like a son.

20:14.067 --> 20:16.322
Smart. Hard-working.

20:16.357 --> 20:18.771
I hired him right out of law school.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.945
What kind of work did he do for you?

20:20.980 --> 20:22.720
An assistant.

20:22.869 --> 20:24.584
He wanted to learn the movie business

20:24.619 --> 20:26.978
from the bottom up, like I did.

20:27.045 --> 20:29.728
Oh, right, you used to be an actor.

20:29.763 --> 20:33.794
Yeah. But I had a nasty habit...
I wanted to eat regularly.

20:33.860 --> 20:36.602
And didn't want to work
as a waiter to do it.

20:36.668 --> 20:38.872
Did Jeff have any nasty habits?

20:40.169 --> 20:44.667
We found several different
drugs in his bloodstream.

20:45.323 --> 20:47.121
What was Jeff doing in Las Vegas?

20:48.396 --> 20:50.740
Um... About a month ago,

20:50.775 --> 20:53.394
when he was making copies
of my divorce settlement,

20:53.429 --> 20:57.988
he spotted a provision that
my wife's lawyer had rephrased.

20:58.261 --> 21:01.632
My lawyers had missed it. He
saved me millions of dollars.

21:01.862 --> 21:04.366
So to thank him, I gave him a vacation.

21:04.433 --> 21:05.387
You give him any cash?

21:06.020 --> 21:08.223
Couple hundred bucks,
corporate credit card.

21:08.258 --> 21:11.595
Told him to have fun.

21:11.630 --> 21:13.394
Fun, huh?

21:13.429 --> 21:15.160
Yeah.

21:15.818 --> 21:18.567
I'll be regretting that
for the resto of my life.

21:23.548 --> 21:25.437
I guess the broadcast paid off.

21:25.472 --> 21:26.890
Black Corvette.

21:26.955 --> 21:28.125
Parking enforcement

21:28.192 --> 21:30.264
found it abandoned off
Durango near Russell.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.067
Right between the pool
hall and the Palermo?

21:33.137 --> 21:34.340
Yup.

21:35.943 --> 21:38.081
This would have been
impossible to drive away.

21:39.182 --> 21:40.020
Yeah.

21:40.086 --> 21:41.721
Bummer.

21:41.901 --> 21:44.358
Please tell me there's something
more to this guys and cars thing

21:44.393 --> 21:46.879
beside the obvious penis
extension metaphors.

21:46.914 --> 21:48.640
So you want me to lie?

21:58.024 --> 21:59.733
Red paint transfer.

22:09.312 --> 22:11.194
I'll get a sample to Hodges.

22:11.974 --> 22:14.239
See if he can match it to the Ferrari.

22:18.483 --> 22:20.015
It's a rental.

22:20.508 --> 22:22.420
Extravagant Automobiles?

22:22.487 --> 22:24.457
No. Zenith?

22:24.524 --> 22:26.931
Yeah, night to be in
the car rental business.

22:26.997 --> 22:29.135
Driver's name is Randy Bolen.

22:29.201 --> 22:31.140
Local address.

22:31.808 --> 22:34.014
Let's go talk to him.

22:38.135 --> 22:40.094
"Randy Bolen.

22:40.161 --> 22:42.567
"Misdemeanor possession, assault,

22:43.111 --> 22:45.441
"felony possession for sales... "

22:47.833 --> 22:50.352
You can't help but
break the law, can you?

22:52.090 --> 22:54.160
What's with the forehead?

22:57.201 --> 23:00.877
Well, you got that bruise somehow.

23:01.982 --> 23:05.054
Want me to add leaving the
scene of an accident to the list?

23:06.952 --> 23:08.929
It was a fender bender. Not my fault.

23:08.996 --> 23:10.533
Sure about that?

23:11.414 --> 23:12.537
Yeah.

23:12.604 --> 23:16.279
Because your car and the
Ferrari were both rented.

23:16.346 --> 23:18.317
So what? It's a coincidence.

23:18.384 --> 23:20.423
You're a local. Why did
you need to rent a car?

23:20.489 --> 23:24.231
I can't afford one all the
time, so I rent one when I can.

23:25.374 --> 23:27.807
What were you doing all night
before your fender bender?

23:27.873 --> 23:30.245
What was I doing? I was shooting pool.

23:30.312 --> 23:33.019
Place called The... The Cue-T.

23:33.087 --> 23:34.890
How'd you play? Did you win any money?

23:34.957 --> 23:36.828
You know, you win some, you lose some.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.116
I guess that would be lose some.

24:00.183 --> 24:01.357
How much?

24:04.756 --> 24:06.520
Ten grand.

24:06.697 --> 24:09.599
That's a lot of money
for a guy like you.

24:18.816 --> 24:20.697
I've had worse nights.

24:22.268 --> 24:23.671
Yeah, I'm sure you have.

24:23.738 --> 24:26.277
You're having one now.

24:26.344 --> 24:27.747
These the guys you played?

24:32.292 --> 24:33.996
Yeah.

24:34.063 --> 24:35.498
Now, there's a coincidence,

24:35.565 --> 24:37.537
because they were in the Ferrari,

24:37.604 --> 24:40.711
which makes you a very sore loser.

25:05.169 --> 25:07.174
Okay.

25:07.658 --> 25:09.039
So I rubbed him a little.

25:09.074 --> 25:10.813
It was a stupid thing to do.

25:10.848 --> 25:12.552
Not as stupid as killing him.

25:14.876 --> 25:16.662
What, that kid... he's dead?

25:17.405 --> 25:18.901
Yeah.

25:23.991 --> 25:25.817
I want a lawyer.

25:25.884 --> 25:26.692
According to his record,

25:26.727 --> 25:29.158
Randy Bolen used to be a
professional stunt driver.

25:30.171 --> 25:31.163
Must not have been a very good one.

25:32.082 --> 25:34.026
He teaches at that
track off Boulder Highway

25:34.061 --> 25:35.712
where middle-aged guys get

25:35.747 --> 25:37.412
to act out their Grand Prix fantasies.

25:37.445 --> 25:40.351
A guy like that gets beat
by a punk kid on the street,

25:40.419 --> 25:42.289
it's gonna be an assault on his manhood.

25:42.356 --> 25:43.658
He's got a temper.

25:43.725 --> 25:46.987
Okay. I'll see if I can place him
at the hotel. I'll let you know.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.407
Hey, Arch. Hey.

25:50.227 --> 25:51.411
Surveillance footage from the Palermo?

25:51.478 --> 25:52.238
Yeah.

25:52.546 --> 25:54.832
I just found something
really interesting.

25:54.952 --> 25:57.166
That's the blonde from the elevator.

25:58.544 --> 25:59.863
There she is again.

26:01.656 --> 26:02.971
And here's Jeff Powell.

26:03.038 --> 26:04.508
This is where his evening begins,

26:04.574 --> 26:06.513
when he meets her for the first time.

26:08.745 --> 26:09.719
Ooh.

26:10.389 --> 26:11.825
She didn't look too happy.

26:11.892 --> 26:13.026
Yeah.

26:13.463 --> 26:14.899
Keep watching

26:14.966 --> 26:16.436
when she points at something.

26:16.503 --> 26:19.477
Keep your eyes on her wine.

26:27.151 --> 26:28.698
You think that was on purpose?

26:29.478 --> 26:31.472
Well, sure looks that way.

26:31.539 --> 26:32.741
Take a look at this.

26:34.824 --> 26:36.383
Girl was loaded.

26:36.450 --> 26:39.585
It's safe to say she wasn't
after him for his money.

26:41.153 --> 26:41.996
Hey.

26:42.660 --> 26:43.567
Hey.

26:44.005 --> 26:46.507
Warrants came through
on the rental agreements.

26:46.574 --> 26:49.146
Jeff Powell went a little
crazy with his corporate card

26:49.213 --> 26:50.780
and rented the Ferrari himself?

26:50.815 --> 26:53.190
No. Heidi Wolff rented it.

26:53.443 --> 26:55.112
The reservation was held in her name

26:55.147 --> 26:56.823
by a company called Caprice Unlimited.

26:56.858 --> 26:58.464
This is where it gets interesting.

26:58.499 --> 27:02.477
Caprice Unlimited also
rented Randy Bolen's Corvette.

27:02.545 --> 27:04.048
What kind of business is it?

27:04.114 --> 27:06.554
All I know so far is
that they're unlisted.

27:07.205 --> 27:10.205
Well, nothing's entirely
unlisted these days.

27:10.563 --> 27:13.069
Caprice Unlimited.

27:18.114 --> 27:21.256
"Caprice Unlimited".

27:21.322 --> 27:24.329
"Anything is possible".

27:24.396 --> 27:26.333
Sounds like a sex business.

27:27.825 --> 27:29.808
What are you going to say?

27:29.875 --> 27:31.613
Uh, something other than,

27:31.680 --> 27:34.352
"A guy is dead, and it
looks like you're involved".

27:34.849 --> 27:36.692
<i>You've reached Caprice Unlimited.</i>

27:36.759 --> 27:39.798
<i>Leave a message; we shall call you.</i>

27:39.865 --> 27:41.836
Not taking calls.

27:43.752 --> 27:45.412
Let's see if they're making any.

28:09.586 --> 28:11.607
Triangulation's consistent.

28:11.674 --> 28:15.008
Caprice Unlimited made the
calls from this address.

28:16.127 --> 28:19.889
According to the building owner,
Caprice is only renting it for two days.

28:45.130 --> 28:46.389
No, not quite.

28:50.115 --> 28:51.734
Oh, yes.

28:51.801 --> 28:53.338
Perfect.

28:54.125 --> 28:54.741
You two,

28:54.808 --> 28:56.680
go get your costumes and

28:56.746 --> 28:58.484
find out what's expected of you.

28:58.550 --> 29:00.755
Why don't you wait for me inside?

29:03.722 --> 29:04.732
I'm sorry.

29:05.333 --> 29:06.937
This is a private residence.

29:07.003 --> 29:08.630
My name is Gil Grissom,
this is Sara Sidle.

29:08.665 --> 29:10.110
We're with the Crime Lab.

29:10.177 --> 29:11.949
Anthony Caprice.

29:12.488 --> 29:13.953
There's no crime here.

29:14.019 --> 29:15.524
That was a job interview.

29:15.590 --> 29:18.808
Over $150,000 has been
spent on this event.

29:18.843 --> 29:20.837
It's for several golf club salesman.

29:20.873 --> 29:21.772
They're from Kansas City.

29:21.839 --> 29:24.777
Japanese formality will mesh
very nicely with their inherent

29:24.812 --> 29:26.750
Midwestern restraint.

29:26.817 --> 29:29.907
Their idealized woman... submissive,

29:29.942 --> 29:32.998
but in control... becomes the geisha.

29:34.687 --> 29:35.805
I get it.

29:36.760 --> 29:39.371
You're one of those companies
that stages fantasies, right?

29:39.406 --> 29:40.976
Everything appears real,

29:41.011 --> 29:42.788
but it's all been worked out in advance?

29:42.854 --> 29:46.262
These scenarios take weeks to craft.

29:46.329 --> 29:48.400
I learn everything

29:48.467 --> 29:51.875
about my client's wants and his desires,

29:51.943 --> 29:53.981
all without him even knowing.

29:54.047 --> 29:56.821
Secret longings...

29:56.887 --> 29:59.059
they have a... a kind of electricity.

29:59.722 --> 30:01.830
They're often much more visible

30:01.865 --> 30:03.938
than we would want them to be.

30:04.889 --> 30:07.445
And, uh, Jeff Powell's evening...

30:07.512 --> 30:10.184
the girl, the car, the billiards...

30:10.252 --> 30:12.124
all paid for by Mick Sheridan?

30:12.189 --> 30:13.661
Never heard of him.

30:14.072 --> 30:15.097
Who did pay?

30:15.163 --> 30:16.500
A benefactor.

30:16.566 --> 30:18.203
Wishes to remain anonymous.

30:18.270 --> 30:21.311
Somebody rich who likes to
manipulate people probably.

30:21.378 --> 30:24.152
Everybody likes to be in control.

30:24.217 --> 30:26.090
You don't have to be rich to want that.

30:26.706 --> 30:29.310
If you're so law-abiding,
why did Heidi Wolff

30:29.345 --> 30:31.884
and Randy Bolen lie to the
police about what happened?

30:31.919 --> 30:33.334
Did you tell them to do that?

30:33.369 --> 30:35.207
All my employees have a very strict

30:35.242 --> 30:37.934
non-disclosure agreement
that they have to sign,

30:37.969 --> 30:40.561
although, I'd never expect
them to lie to the police.

30:40.596 --> 30:42.956
Maybe you just asked
them the wrong questions.

30:43.611 --> 30:45.902
Here's a copy of Mr. Powell's scenario.

30:45.969 --> 30:48.965
Every event that they talked
about was meticulously planned

30:49.001 --> 30:52.785
in advance and timed down to the minute.

30:53.446 --> 30:54.823
And his murder?

30:54.890 --> 30:56.962
Tragic.

30:57.028 --> 30:59.033
But it's not in my script.

31:01.108 --> 31:01.974
Now, if you'll excuse me,

31:02.040 --> 31:03.531
I have a hot tub to calibrate.

31:04.777 --> 31:05.481
Oh.

31:06.919 --> 31:09.882
And may all your dreams come true.

31:18.944 --> 31:21.449
That's the first time that the tower

31:21.516 --> 31:23.754
yanked back my Gulfstream on takeoff.

31:23.821 --> 31:24.509
No kidding.

31:24.544 --> 31:26.415
Well, there's always
a first for everything.

31:26.451 --> 31:27.677
We can talk in here.

31:27.713 --> 31:30.103
Something wrong with your office?

31:30.170 --> 31:31.124
No.

31:34.413 --> 31:35.615
You seem to have bad luck

31:35.682 --> 31:38.522
with the people who work for you.

31:38.622 --> 31:42.299
If that's a joke, it's
in pretty poor taste.

31:42.731 --> 31:44.180
Three years ago, you were busted

31:44.215 --> 31:46.108
with an eight ball of
cocaine in your luggage.

31:46.174 --> 31:48.677
You claimed that your personal
assistant had planted it.

31:48.713 --> 31:50.385
That's because he did.

31:50.451 --> 31:53.157
The charges against me were dropped.

31:53.224 --> 31:55.463
The poor kid had a serious problem.

31:55.529 --> 31:56.966
I got him into a program.

31:57.033 --> 31:58.603
Understand he's doing better now.

31:59.708 --> 32:02.446
I hear you bought him a car to
shut him up and take the rap.

32:02.513 --> 32:04.583
The media spins every...

32:07.144 --> 32:08.226
The media.

32:10.432 --> 32:13.439
We found an ounce of cocaine in
Jeff Powell's personal effects.

32:13.505 --> 32:14.741
He was buying drugs for you.

32:14.808 --> 32:17.147
I don't do drugs.

32:17.214 --> 32:20.388
And I had no idea that
Jeff had a drug problem.

32:20.455 --> 32:22.259
Last time, you bought a car,

32:22.326 --> 32:25.500
this time, an elaborate
fantasy to shut him up.

32:25.567 --> 32:27.438
Problem is, he's dead.

32:27.917 --> 32:29.709
And that makes you responsible.

32:29.776 --> 32:32.884
Captain Brass...

32:32.951 --> 32:34.989
you've seen too many of my movies.

32:37.060 --> 32:39.933
I'd like to call my attorney now.

32:40.217 --> 32:42.166
The script for Jeff's fantasy begins

32:42.202 --> 32:45.079
with Heidi and Randy renting
the cars at 6:00 p. m.

32:45.146 --> 32:48.878
Then it says Randy drives the
Corvette to The Cue-T and waits.

32:48.913 --> 32:50.914
And Heidi takes the Ferrari.

32:50.949 --> 32:52.095
Finds Jeff

32:52.724 --> 32:54.434
at the Palermo bar.

32:54.501 --> 32:56.473
Her instructions were: "Act upset.

32:56.540 --> 32:58.478
"Make up story about abusive
high roller boyfriend.

32:58.545 --> 33:01.013
Allow Jeff to offer comfort".

33:01.048 --> 33:02.921
Sorry. I'm really okay.

33:04.090 --> 33:05.994
No, I'm not.

33:06.062 --> 33:07.566
Anything I can do for you?

33:08.144 --> 33:10.488
It's my damn boyfriend.

33:11.911 --> 33:15.250
Any guy would help a beautiful
woman in distress, right?

33:15.317 --> 33:17.255
Some guys are intimidated by beauty

33:17.322 --> 33:19.233
or fear rejection.

33:19.727 --> 33:21.699
Evidently, Caprice knew Jeff well enough

33:21.764 --> 33:22.968
to know he'd want to help her.

33:23.416 --> 33:25.003
Heidi's next instructions were:

33:25.038 --> 33:28.046
"Repay subject's
kindness by buying drink".

33:28.342 --> 33:31.723
Which she then accidentally
spills on his clothes.

33:31.788 --> 33:34.696
Insists on buying him a new outfit,

33:34.762 --> 33:37.269
one that he couldn't afford on his own.

33:37.743 --> 33:40.008
Everything was scripted
down to the minute...

33:40.074 --> 33:41.244
the clothes,

33:41.749 --> 33:42.682
The Cue-T,

33:43.208 --> 33:44.638
the car.

33:46.251 --> 33:47.693
Sheridan told Caprice

33:47.761 --> 33:50.506
that Jeff had been shooting
pool since he was a kid.

33:50.541 --> 33:51.735
So betting on and winning

33:51.835 --> 33:54.309
a big money game was probably
just part of the fantasy.

33:54.375 --> 33:55.979
Yeah, and he was a NASCAR fan.

33:56.046 --> 33:58.552
So the whole staged car
chase, narrow getaway

33:58.619 --> 33:59.888
was everything he dreamed about.

34:00.259 --> 34:02.594
As was the partying in his hotel room.

34:02.662 --> 34:04.231
And the sex.

34:04.298 --> 34:05.435
Not quite.

34:05.501 --> 34:07.005
According to the script,

34:07.072 --> 34:09.132
"Your employment ends
with the good-night kiss.

34:09.167 --> 34:10.882
"You are not requested to perform,

34:10.917 --> 34:12.217
"nor compensated for,

34:12.252 --> 34:14.971
"any activity you
initiate beyond this point.

34:15.643 --> 34:20.034
Should nature take its
course, you are on your own".

34:22.568 --> 34:25.449
So the staged fantasy
ended at Jeff's hotel room.

34:26.925 --> 34:29.327
Which means he was off
script when he was killed.

34:29.424 --> 34:31.128
I don't get it.

34:31.195 --> 34:34.168
After a night like that, I
would have felt like Superman.

34:34.235 --> 34:35.672
Why leave the girl?

34:39.170 --> 34:40.949
The victim got to the shopping arcade

34:41.018 --> 34:43.324
15 minutes after he
got off the elevator.

34:43.360 --> 34:44.574
It's not that long a walk.

34:44.609 --> 34:47.525
I need to know what he
was doing during that time.

34:49.708 --> 34:50.940
There's your guy.

34:54.918 --> 34:57.209
Whatever he's reacting to is off camera.

34:58.095 --> 35:02.469
Somewhere in the direction
of the baccarat tables.

35:02.535 --> 35:05.274
When the blonde came up to the
vic in the bar the first time,

35:05.309 --> 35:07.112
she pointed in that same direction.

35:07.179 --> 35:09.031
What's going on over there?

35:12.008 --> 35:14.219
He's playing solo with the dealer.

35:14.330 --> 35:16.669
That's ten or 20,000 a hand.

35:16.704 --> 35:17.972
Guy's a whale.

35:21.212 --> 35:23.284
Your vic's really going at him.

35:24.249 --> 35:28.630
You know, Heidi was only
supposed to tell a story

35:28.697 --> 35:30.916
about a high roller boyfriend.

35:32.238 --> 35:35.312
Maybe she actually picked somebody out.

35:40.659 --> 35:42.296
What are you doing?

35:42.362 --> 35:44.634
I've been looking at
video three days solid now.

35:45.063 --> 35:46.471
My butt fell asleep.

35:49.950 --> 35:50.945
Wait a second.

35:51.685 --> 35:54.314
I've seen those guys
behind him somewhere else.

35:55.460 --> 35:56.429
Hang on.

35:57.281 --> 36:00.235
Jeff went from the casino to the arcade,

36:00.839 --> 36:02.944
and right behind him, here they are.

36:03.475 --> 36:04.681
Same guys.

36:12.616 --> 36:14.872
Well, call me Ishmael.

36:15.246 --> 36:16.476
Why?

36:16.542 --> 36:18.728
You need to read more, Arch.

36:22.390 --> 36:25.965
Jeff was a winner at
everything he tried that night.

36:26.032 --> 36:27.769
And he was falling in love.

36:27.836 --> 36:30.998
Which can make a guy do
some pretty stupid things.

36:31.110 --> 36:33.817
So anytime more than
$10,000 hits the table,

36:33.884 --> 36:36.288
the casino's required to ID the player.

36:36.356 --> 36:38.326
Which may help us harpoon a whale.

36:38.393 --> 36:39.430
Yep.

36:43.093 --> 36:44.374
What's the occasion?

36:44.442 --> 36:46.245
We're investigating the
death of the young man

36:46.312 --> 36:47.347
on the casino's loading dock.

36:47.415 --> 36:49.196
Are you familiar with this guy?

36:49.486 --> 36:50.857
That's Dennis Kim.

36:50.924 --> 36:52.160
Flies in four, five times a year

36:52.226 --> 36:53.831
from Seoul to play baccarat.

36:53.897 --> 36:55.433
Very generous player.

36:55.501 --> 36:58.174
We reserve a table exclusively
for him while he's in town.

36:58.240 --> 36:59.543
He still in town?

37:01.038 --> 37:02.031
Yeah.

37:02.217 --> 37:03.519
He's at his table right now.

37:06.207 --> 37:08.131
Player has two.

37:08.197 --> 37:09.433
Bank.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.517
Mr. Kim, we need to speak
with you for a moment.

37:12.374 --> 37:13.376
Yes?

37:13.548 --> 37:15.748
Do you recognize this man?

37:19.578 --> 37:20.727
Why?

37:20.848 --> 37:22.190
He's dead.

37:23.125 --> 37:25.746
Just before he died,
he was talking to you.

37:28.011 --> 37:29.346
Oh, yes, I remember him.

37:29.413 --> 37:30.918
He was shouting about some girl.

37:31.830 --> 37:32.855
Hey you!

37:32.922 --> 37:34.559
Hey! Guess what?

37:34.625 --> 37:38.735
Heidi, she doesn't need you
or your money anymore, man.

37:38.802 --> 37:41.642
That's right. Because she has
everything she needs now...

37:41.709 --> 37:43.314
love and respect.

37:43.379 --> 37:45.752
So you go ahead and play
your little card game.

37:45.819 --> 37:46.267
All right?

37:46.302 --> 37:48.024
'Cause you the playa.

37:48.091 --> 37:49.493
But I'm the man.

37:50.463 --> 37:51.967
The man.

37:52.532 --> 37:53.637
Crazy boy.

37:55.124 --> 37:56.490
Did you guys see where he went?

38:07.369 --> 38:09.341
Well, we're gonna need
to take those shoes.

38:09.681 --> 38:10.912
White paint.

38:12.414 --> 38:13.751
And if I don't permit this?

38:14.550 --> 38:16.825
We'll just hold your m
until we get a warrant.

38:24.743 --> 38:26.348
Kamsahamnida.

39:25.823 --> 39:28.527
The bodyguards dragged Jeff
through the service corridor.

39:30.587 --> 39:33.665
Between the drugs and the confidence,

39:33.700 --> 39:35.176
he must've put up quite a fight.

39:35.243 --> 39:36.446
Hey!

39:39.619 --> 39:41.492
Most likely, he was still
alive when they left.

39:41.558 --> 39:43.562
They probably thought they
just had taught him a lesson.

39:44.572 --> 39:45.311
They did:

39:45.347 --> 39:47.838
Don't confuse fantasy with reality.

39:48.287 --> 39:50.512
Well, hush money or
not, you have to admit

39:50.547 --> 39:55.021
that whole fantasy night
thing was a pretty cool gift

39:55.022 --> 39:56.960
from a very generous boss.

39:57.888 --> 40:00.636
Greg, don't you have
a birthday coming up?

40:00.736 --> 40:02.807
Why, yes, Sara, I do.

40:03.144 --> 40:06.717
I'm thinking ear-shredding
rock, a beautiful model,

40:06.752 --> 40:08.304
boatloads of sushi

40:08.339 --> 40:10.125
and latex.

40:10.192 --> 40:12.230
Eh, that was last year.

40:13.732 --> 40:16.696
I think fantasies are best kept private.

40:16.739 --> 40:18.311
Hey.

40:18.377 --> 40:20.950
Want to know why Jeff left
the girl and went downstairs?

40:21.016 --> 40:22.621
Okay.

40:22.688 --> 40:24.960
This was dropped off at the Palermo.

40:25.026 --> 40:27.198
Manager sent it over.

40:27.265 --> 40:28.802
Nice rocks.

40:29.904 --> 40:32.477
Jeff must have spent the ten
G's he won playing pool on it.

40:32.544 --> 40:35.217
Gift wrapped, never picked it up.

40:35.284 --> 40:36.913
Yeah, there was a jewelry store

40:36.948 --> 40:39.561
right across from the
service corridor entrance.

40:43.470 --> 40:45.642
Most I ever spent on a girl.

40:46.595 --> 40:48.649
Most I ever held in my hand at one time.

40:52.761 --> 40:55.048
You know, the biggest fantasy in Vegas

40:55.083 --> 40:57.336
is that everything
here happens by chance.

40:57.403 --> 40:59.941
Nothing here happens by chance.

41:00.537 --> 41:02.548
The odds are set before
you get off the plane.

41:04.105 --> 41:07.068
You know, I'd settle
for a birthday breakfast.
