00:04.360 --> 00:10.830
<b>As Gon was dedicating all of his 
power to finishing off Neferpitou,</b>

00:11.450 --> 00:14.950
<b>Meruem, Pouf, and Youpi were</b>

00:14.950 --> 00:18.050
<b>inside the west tower, where Komugi had been.</b>

00:42.090 --> 00:43.520
<b><i>Once we're through here...</i></b>

00:54.030 --> 00:55.590
<b><i>The west tower's second floor.</i></b>

00:56.490 --> 00:58.030
<b><i>Once we've passed this area,</i></b>

00:59.840 --> 01:01.680
<b><i>the King will never remember her!</i></b>

01:04.290 --> 01:08.040
<b><i>As long as I don't give him 
an opportunity to see her...</i></b>

02:33.000 --> 02:38.010
<b>Flash x And x Start</b>

02:54.580 --> 02:56.540
<b><i>Something is missing...</i></b>

02:59.220 --> 03:02.680
<b><i>But what is it?</i></b>

03:05.270 --> 03:06.400
<b>I don't know.</b>

03:10.690 --> 03:11.990
<b><i>I know...</i></b>

03:12.490 --> 03:13.840
<b><i>I won't say anything.</i></b>

03:14.190 --> 03:19.000
<b><i>I agree that we shouldn't let the King see her.</i></b>

03:22.090 --> 03:24.990
<b><i>Ideally, he should stay as he is now.</i></b>

03:27.370 --> 03:28.850
<b>I have</b>

03:29.570 --> 03:32.310
<b>a feeling that something is 
missing from this place.</b>

03:33.430 --> 03:39.860
<b>Though it may just be a side 
effect of my memory loss.</b>

03:42.180 --> 03:43.860
<b>Exactly...</b>

03:44.290 --> 03:48.750
<b>Your memory can be verified 
through what you see.</b>

03:48.750 --> 03:53.620
<b>Which means you can recover all 
of the memories you need.</b>

03:55.540 --> 03:58.630
<b>I believe the selection was to begin at 12:00.</b>

03:58.930 --> 03:59.780
<b>Yes.</b>

04:00.200 --> 04:03.150
<b>However, that can be moved up.</b>

04:03.980 --> 04:05.240
<b>By 9:00,</b>

04:05.240 --> 04:09.020
<b>the remaining humans will be gathered 
in the plain before the palace.</b>

04:12.320 --> 04:13.310
<b>What is it?</b>

04:13.800 --> 04:15.790
<b>I have not used my scales</b>

04:15.790 --> 04:17.890
<b>on the humans still on their way in.</b>

04:18.890 --> 04:21.060
<b>We don't want them to cause a commotion,</b>

04:21.060 --> 04:25.110
<b>so I will summon my clones to hypnotize them.</b>

04:25.780 --> 04:27.260
<b>What will you do, Youpi?</b>

04:29.380 --> 04:30.700
<b>Right...</b>

04:31.560 --> 04:32.910
<b>I'll look for Pitou.</b>

04:34.200 --> 04:39.120
<b>Right now, I don't have the 
strength to protect you.</b>

04:40.000 --> 04:40.860
<b>Pitou...</b>

04:44.420 --> 04:46.560
<b>Did you just remember something?</b>

04:47.050 --> 04:51.680
<b>Oh, yeah... We haven't told 
the King about Pitou yet.</b>

04:52.160 --> 04:56.820
<b>Meruem-sama, do you remember who Pitou is?</b>

04:57.360 --> 04:58.280
<b>Yes,</b>

04:58.760 --> 05:01.190
<b>one of my three Royal Guards.</b>

05:02.500 --> 05:04.790
<b>I can recall Pitou's appearance so clearly,</b>

05:05.870 --> 05:11.350
<b>it seems a mystery that I 
didn't remember it until now.</b>

05:13.790 --> 05:15.520
<b><i>So words can also trigger his memory,</i></b>

05:16.060 --> 05:17.980
<b><i>not just images...</i></b>

05:20.140 --> 05:22.190
<b><i>We cannot let him hear her name.</i></b>

05:22.190 --> 05:23.510
<b><i>We must be very careful...</i></b>

05:25.940 --> 05:28.780
<b><i>The key will be convincing Pitou.</i></b>

05:31.120 --> 05:32.580
<b><i>I know...</i></b>

05:32.950 --> 05:34.330
<b><i>Tell Pitou to keep quiet, right?</i></b>

05:42.030 --> 05:43.230
<b><i>There it is again...</i></b>

05:46.060 --> 05:48.240
<b><i>I'm counting on you.</i></b>

05:50.060 --> 05:51.240
<b><i>Yes...</i></b>

05:52.040 --> 05:53.070
<b><i>I...</i></b>

05:54.150 --> 05:55.300
<b><i>asked Pitou</i></b>

05:56.020 --> 05:58.250
<b><i>to do something for me.</i></b>

06:06.630 --> 06:07.600
<b>Youpi.</b>

06:07.600 --> 06:08.560
<b>Yes...</b>

06:08.560 --> 06:12.140
<b>Bring Pitou to me at once.</b>

06:12.140 --> 06:12.980
<b>Yes.</b>

06:13.400 --> 06:15.700
<b>What will you do, Meruem-sama?</b>

06:16.300 --> 06:19.570
<b>Enemies are still around.</b>

06:20.390 --> 06:21.610
<b>Indeed...</b>

06:22.470 --> 06:24.900
<b>As I search for Pitou myself,</b>

06:26.090 --> 06:27.900
<b>I shall hunt down the remaining intruders.</b>

06:29.470 --> 06:30.590
<b><i>This is bad!</i></b>

06:32.610 --> 06:34.450
<b>Your Majesty, that would be...</b>

06:36.190 --> 06:37.820
<b>It is merely for entertainment.</b>

06:38.930 --> 06:41.860
<b>And I am sure these enemies 
have useful information.</b>

06:41.860 --> 06:44.920
<b>However, we won't be at your side,</b>

06:45.380 --> 06:47.020
<b>and we don't know what enemies remainâ€”</b>

06:53.970 --> 06:55.950
<b>I want an honest answer,</b>

06:56.810 --> 06:57.930
<b>Pouf.</b>

06:59.940 --> 07:02.510
<b>Do you believe there is a chance</b>

07:03.370 --> 07:07.020
<b>that these intruders could get the better of me?!</b>

07:32.130 --> 07:32.950
<b>No...</b>

07:33.690 --> 07:35.720
<b>Absolutely not.</b>

07:40.590 --> 07:43.400
<b><i>Th-This exceeds my expectations...</i></b>

07:49.330 --> 07:50.110
<b>The King...</b>

07:50.890 --> 07:52.230
<b>Meruem-sama...</b>

07:53.220 --> 07:55.200
<b>is the ultimate being.</b>

07:56.020 --> 07:57.790
<b>That much is certain!</b>

08:05.800 --> 08:08.250
<b>The overwhelming aura</b>

08:08.770 --> 08:11.090
<b>left Knuckle and the rest, still concealed,</b>

08:11.340 --> 08:14.020
<b>in total despair.</b>

08:15.630 --> 08:21.020
<b><i>Th-This isn't something we can deal with...</i></b>

08:21.820 --> 08:26.940
<b><i>To handle this, you'd need an entire 
nation's military might.</i></b>

08:27.550 --> 08:29.610
<b>Meleoron, we're making a run for it!</b>

08:29.940 --> 08:31.200
<b>Seriously?</b>

08:31.200 --> 08:32.570
<b>You bet!</b>

08:32.570 --> 08:35.260
<b>We'll head back to Peijing under 
the cover of this crowd!</b>

08:36.550 --> 08:38.950
<b>What about Killua, Ikalgo, and the others?</b>

08:38.950 --> 08:40.560
<b>There's nothing we can do!</b>

08:41.190 --> 08:43.380
<b>If they can see that, they'll understand.</b>

08:43.380 --> 08:44.860
<b>They'll run away, too.</b>

08:45.540 --> 08:46.770
<b>That's the only option.</b>

08:47.370 --> 08:48.630
<b>That isn't...</b>

08:50.440 --> 08:53.130
<b>something we can handle.</b>

08:53.890 --> 08:57.010
<b>But if you and I team up...</b>

08:58.360 --> 09:00.010
<b>We could land one attack, sure.</b>

09:00.410 --> 09:05.140
<b>And we could probably attach APR.</b>

09:05.660 --> 09:06.870
<b>But...</b>

09:07.740 --> 09:13.530
<b>APR only adds interest if I'm within fifty meters!</b>

09:14.650 --> 09:18.020
<b>If we're within fifty meters of him...</b>

09:18.960 --> 09:23.040
<b>Do you think we'd last long 
enough for him to go bust?</b>

09:23.790 --> 09:27.040
<b>You'd have to have lungs as strong as the boss's!</b>

09:27.670 --> 09:29.390
<b>The situation's changed...</b>

09:29.390 --> 09:34.270
<b>The enemy knows about our powers!</b>

09:34.910 --> 09:37.550
<b>They can prepare for us.</b>

09:38.950 --> 09:41.030
<b>I was an idiot.</b>

09:41.030 --> 09:45.950
<b>We needed to notify the Association 
right away of the chairman's defeat,</b>

09:45.950 --> 09:49.270
<b>so they could immediately initiate 
the next plan of action.</b>

09:51.060 --> 09:52.000
<b>Hurry!</b>

09:55.300 --> 09:57.320
<b>Revenge and duty...</b>

09:57.840 --> 10:01.270
<b>The difference in motivations 
between Meleoron and Knuckle</b>

10:01.990 --> 10:04.790
<b>placed growing distance between 
them as they walked.</b>

10:08.060 --> 10:09.080
<b>At that moment...</b>

10:11.470 --> 10:18.040
<b>Meruem's <i>En</i> lit up the palace and the 
surrounding area in a literal flash.</b>

10:25.910 --> 10:30.860
<b>Sensing there were two enemies nearby, 
he began with Knuckle.</b>

10:35.140 --> 10:37.390
<b>Next was Meleoron, who had barely thought</b>

10:37.390 --> 10:41.550
<b>that he should activate his power 
when he was knocked out.</b>

10:50.920 --> 10:51.880
<b>Where's the King?</b>

10:55.360 --> 10:56.510
<b>It disappeared!</b>

11:02.050 --> 11:04.770
<b>I shall be interrogating them.</b>

11:05.570 --> 11:07.520
<b>Once I am done, do as you like.</b>

11:09.770 --> 11:15.250
<b>There were two other <i>Nen</i> users whose aura</b>

11:16.510 --> 11:17.780
<b>reacted to my <i>En</i>.</b>

11:22.800 --> 11:27.760
<b><i>One of them must be carrying 
the unconscious Komugi.</i></b>

11:29.140 --> 11:31.420
<b><i>What do I do? What do I do?</i></b>

11:36.960 --> 11:39.010
<b><i>I must stop the King...</i></b>

11:39.640 --> 11:40.920
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

11:46.870 --> 11:51.690
<b>If your purpose is entertainment, 
shouldn't you take your time?</b>

11:51.970 --> 11:53.000
<b>It appears</b>

11:54.550 --> 11:56.460
<b>that you have a proposal.</b>

11:56.870 --> 11:59.690
<b>Yes... Would you be willing</b>

12:00.390 --> 12:02.450
<b>to engage in a contest with us?</b>

12:03.580 --> 12:04.520
<b>A contest?</b>

12:06.470 --> 12:07.520
<b><i>Again...</i></b>

12:09.450 --> 12:10.700
<b><i>A contest...</i></b>

12:11.990 --> 12:13.120
<b><i>A contest...</i></b>

12:18.950 --> 12:20.080
<b><i>A contest...</i></b>

12:21.610 --> 12:22.690
<b><i>A contest...</i></b>

12:26.250 --> 12:27.660
<b>What contest?</b>

12:28.390 --> 12:31.070
<b>Youpi and I will search for Pitou,</b>

12:31.070 --> 12:34.620
<b>while you search for the 
two remaining <i>Nen</i> users.</b>

12:35.590 --> 12:39.290
<b>A contest to see who locates their target first?</b>

12:39.290 --> 12:39.980
<b>Yes.</b>

12:40.360 --> 12:44.420
<b>But don't you need to go and spread scales?</b>

12:44.420 --> 12:45.740
<b>Correct.</b>

12:46.230 --> 12:50.460
<b>So while I hypnotize the remaining humans,</b>

12:50.860 --> 12:54.020
<b>I would request that Meruem-sama wait here.</b>

12:55.260 --> 12:56.940
<b>It is very clear</b>

12:56.940 --> 13:00.630
<b>that the difference in power between you 
and the intruders is insurmountable.</b>

13:01.090 --> 13:04.500
<b>Finding and capturing them should 
only take you a few seconds.</b>

13:04.990 --> 13:06.750
<b>That cannot be called entertainment.</b>

13:07.790 --> 13:10.500
<b>Meanwhile, we must find Pitou,</b>

13:10.500 --> 13:14.190
<b>who has engaged an enemy that 
seems capable of teleportation.</b>

13:14.190 --> 13:16.300
<b>And Pitou's current location is unknown.</b>

13:17.910 --> 13:19.880
<b>To make up for the difference,</b>

13:19.880 --> 13:25.110
<b>we request additional time, 
as well as one further handicap.</b>

13:25.410 --> 13:26.910
<b>One further handicap?</b>

13:27.630 --> 13:28.540
<b>What is it?</b>

13:30.520 --> 13:33.370
<b>You are only allowed to use <i>En</i> once more.</b>

13:34.000 --> 13:35.740
<b>How does that sound?</b>

13:40.190 --> 13:41.380
<b>Amusing.</b>

13:43.660 --> 13:46.090
<b>I accept this contest.</b>

13:46.460 --> 13:48.390
<b>Thank you very much.</b>

13:49.440 --> 13:50.760
<b><i>Perfect...</i></b>

13:50.760 --> 13:54.460
<b><i>I can use the extra time to kill that woman!</i></b>

13:57.100 --> 14:01.400
<b>As long as we are playing, 
I have a proposal, as well.</b>

14:02.700 --> 14:07.660
<b>If you win, I shall grant each of you a wish.</b>

14:09.780 --> 14:10.900
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

14:10.900 --> 14:12.490
<b>We are very honored.</b>

14:13.250 --> 14:16.910
<b>And what if you win, Meruem-sama?</b>

14:17.340 --> 14:19.320
<b>If I win,</b>

14:20.310 --> 14:24.420
<b>you will tell me what you are hiding from me.</b>

14:33.120 --> 14:33.810
<b>Your Majesty...</b>

14:33.810 --> 14:34.600
<b>Silence.</b>

14:36.570 --> 14:37.960
<b>I already told you...</b>

14:38.530 --> 14:42.320
<b>You and I are united as one.</b>

14:42.990 --> 14:49.450
<b>Did you think that I could not sense 
the guilt that you now feel?</b>

14:51.450 --> 14:56.530
<b>However, I sense that your feelings 
of loyalty are stronger.</b>

14:58.940 --> 15:03.010
<b>Otherwise, I would have sent 
your heads flying long ago.</b>

15:10.170 --> 15:12.330
<b>I am certain you have your reasons.</b>

15:13.190 --> 15:14.850
<b>I shall not ask them...</b>

15:16.060 --> 15:18.260
<b>Assuming that you beat me.</b>

15:22.140 --> 15:26.520
<b>You will obtain what you desire, 
and protect your secret.</b>

15:27.070 --> 15:29.490
<b>You could not wish for better terms...</b>

15:30.920 --> 15:33.810
<b>Assuming that you beat me.</b>

15:41.930 --> 15:43.380
<b>Meruem-sama...</b>

15:44.080 --> 15:48.380
<b>I shall immediately begin to spread 
scales, and not waste a moment.</b>

15:48.970 --> 15:52.510
<b>If we lose, we will tell you everything.</b>

15:53.790 --> 15:56.050
<b>I swear it on my life.</b>

15:58.860 --> 16:02.270
<b>You do not appear to be treating 
this as mere entertainment.</b>

16:05.280 --> 16:10.210
<b>Once Pouf finishes spreading his 
scales and returns, I shall begin.</b>

16:11.230 --> 16:12.530
<b>Is that acceptable?</b>

16:12.760 --> 16:13.520
<b>Yes.</b>

16:14.480 --> 16:19.160
<b>Victory goes to whomever returns to 
this room with their target first.</b>

16:20.130 --> 16:23.600
<b>If Pitou should return,</b>

16:23.990 --> 16:26.450
<b>you are to explain the objective of this contest</b>

16:26.450 --> 16:29.170
<b>and order Pitou to hide.</b>

16:29.170 --> 16:30.170
<b>As you wish.</b>

16:30.870 --> 16:32.830
<b>I shall tell you that</b>

16:33.440 --> 16:35.790
<b>the two <i>Nen</i> users my <i>En</i> registered</b>

16:35.790 --> 16:38.930
<b>were an octopus and a human 
carrying some sort of burden.</b>

16:41.670 --> 16:42.900
<b><i>I must win.</i></b>

16:43.460 --> 16:45.880
<b><i>No, victory is already assured!</i></b>

16:47.710 --> 16:51.820
<b><i>The question is what to do 
about Pitou and the woman.</i></b>

16:55.420 --> 16:56.440
<b>Then...</b>

16:57.050 --> 16:58.080
<b>Start!</b>

17:04.310 --> 17:06.560
<b>Where do you think Pitou went?</b>

17:06.560 --> 17:09.590
<b>It'll be fine! Pitou should return soon!</b>

17:09.880 --> 17:14.270
<b>Turn around and wait by the west 
tower for Pitou's return.</b>

17:14.710 --> 17:17.090
<b>Do not allow Pitou near the King!</b>

17:17.460 --> 17:21.450
<b>You can't use clones while you 
spread your scales, right?</b>

17:21.450 --> 17:23.480
<b>Then you aren't buying us any time.</b>

17:23.760 --> 17:25.280
<b>Trust me!</b>

17:25.660 --> 17:26.790
<b>I'm begging you!</b>

17:37.780 --> 17:40.990
<b><i>Unbelievable... Such tremendous aura...</i></b>

17:42.470 --> 17:44.470
<b><i>Those two are dead.</i></b>

17:45.100 --> 17:46.000
<b><i>No,</i></b>

17:46.450 --> 17:47.790
<b><i>they're still alive.</i></b>

17:48.270 --> 17:50.060
<b><i>They were only knocked unconscious...</i></b>

17:51.070 --> 17:52.000
<b><i>Where's Gon?</i></b>

17:52.990 --> 17:54.690
<b><i>Killua's carrying him...</i></b>

17:55.660 --> 17:57.230
<b><i>His hair is long?</i></b>

17:57.230 --> 17:58.300
<b><i>Is it someone else?</i></b>

17:58.980 --> 18:02.590
<b><i>No, those are the only two 
figures in my crystal ball.</i></b>

18:02.590 --> 18:03.690
<b><i>That is Gon!</i></b>

18:04.390 --> 18:06.940
<b><i>Something must have happened 
when I wasn't watching.</i></b>

18:07.500 --> 18:08.490
<b><i>Where's Pitou?</i></b>

18:09.730 --> 18:12.610
<b><i>In any case, don't come back here... Please!</i></b>

18:14.580 --> 18:18.030
<b><i>Pouf is spreading scales on the citizens...</i></b>

18:18.790 --> 18:19.970
<b><i>Are they poisonous?</i></b>

18:20.340 --> 18:23.170
<b><i>It would help me more if he'd stay near the King.</i></b>

18:24.240 --> 18:27.800
<b><i>In any case, he's on the palace's opposite side.</i></b>

18:27.800 --> 18:30.100
<b><i>I must get as far from my 
previous location as I can...</i></b>

18:31.200 --> 18:34.800
<b><i>After that</i> En <i>wave, I immediately used Wink Blue,</i></b>

18:35.350 --> 18:41.260
<b><i>and the King appeared next to Pouf, 
carrying Knuckle and Meleoron.</i></b>

18:41.750 --> 18:44.210
<b><i>Only a few seconds had passed!</i></b>

18:46.300 --> 18:48.890
<b><i>Next, he will pursue Ikalgo or me.</i></b>

18:48.890 --> 18:51.960
<b><i>The King could be standing behind 
me at any moment...</i></b>

18:51.960 --> 18:55.240
<b><i>I must hurry and get farther away...</i></b>

18:55.240 --> 18:57.580
<b><i>Before the King uses</i> En <i>again!</i></b>

19:00.800 --> 19:02.180
<b><i>I must go in there!</i></b>

19:02.940 --> 19:06.700
<b><i>If I'm crossing the plain when he uses</i> En, <i>I won't be able to escape!</i></b>

19:08.310 --> 19:12.060
<b><i>If I'm deep underground, 
perhaps his</i> En <i>won't reach.</i></b>

19:12.730 --> 19:15.590
<b><i>But I'm also trapping myself.</i></b>

19:16.380 --> 19:18.930
<b><i>Should I escape outside the palace,</i></b>

19:18.930 --> 19:21.250
<b><i>and hope that the King doesn't 
make a move for a while?</i></b>

19:21.250 --> 19:23.180
<b><i>There's no reason to expect him not to!</i></b>

19:30.760 --> 19:31.690
<b><i>What should I do?</i></b>

19:32.580 --> 19:33.860
<b><i>What is the right decision?</i></b>

19:38.600 --> 19:39.480
<b>Ikalgo!</b>

19:39.480 --> 19:40.880
<b>I thought you might come here...</b>

19:41.600 --> 19:43.370
<b>Let's go in! Hurry!</b>

19:43.370 --> 19:44.710
<b>Yes, but...</b>

19:44.710 --> 19:45.430
<b>Hurry!</b>

19:45.800 --> 19:47.220
<b>Isn't that why you came here?</b>

19:47.730 --> 19:49.830
<b>If he uses <i>En</i> again, we're finished!</b>

19:57.260 --> 19:58.130
<b>Where's Killua?</b>

19:58.610 --> 20:00.320
<b>He went after Gon.</b>

20:00.320 --> 20:01.750
<b>They're together now.</b>

20:03.110 --> 20:05.190
<b>I don't know what happened to Pitou.</b>

20:14.390 --> 20:15.470
<b>I see...</b>

20:15.940 --> 20:18.720
<b>So Meleoron and Knuckle were captured.</b>

20:20.060 --> 20:22.270
<b>The King is on a whole other level.</b>

20:25.990 --> 20:28.770
<b>Why do you think their lives were spared?</b>

20:28.770 --> 20:30.930
<b>Um, well...</b>

20:31.830 --> 20:36.430
<b>It's possible that I just want 
to think that they're alive...</b>

20:37.360 --> 20:38.540
<b>They're alive.</b>

20:39.370 --> 20:41.670
<b>Probably so they can be exchanged.</b>

20:43.030 --> 20:45.680
<b>You mean the way Killua discussed 
exchanging hostages?</b>

20:47.120 --> 20:48.810
<b>I'll set a trap...</b>

20:49.860 --> 20:51.590
<b>I'm not going out without a fight.</b>

20:53.170 --> 20:56.710
<b>First, we'll hide the girl in Bizeff's room!</b>

21:45.990 --> 21:46.980
<b><i>A contest...</i></b>

21:50.940 --> 21:52.210
<b><i>A contest...</i></b>

23:24.610 --> 23:26.760
<b>Next time: Deadline x To x Live.</b>

23:27.210 --> 23:28.130
<b>Killua...</b>

23:28.130 --> 23:30.580
<b>Don't you dare speak his name!</b>

23:30.580 --> 23:32.390
<b>You would never understand!</b>

23:33.000 --> 23:34.350
<b>Killua!</b>
