00:07.632 --> 00:08.591
What about...

00:10.051 --> 00:13.013
"Why are you doing this?"

00:13.096 --> 00:15.432
-No, hey, whoa. Delete that.
-Why?

00:15.515 --> 00:17.225
You can't just ask him
why he's doing this.

00:17.308 --> 00:18.935
We need something stronger. Come on.

00:19.602 --> 00:21.604
"Bold move, DeMarcus."

00:22.272 --> 00:24.315
-What? No.
-Yeah.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.318
Okay, first off,
that's way too big of a jump, okay?

00:27.402 --> 00:30.113
And second off, you don't
type in the app, dude.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.073
-You draft in the Notes app.
-Yeah, you're right.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.409
Everyone knows that.
That way you don't see dot-dot-dot.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.619
Good point. What about this?

00:37.537 --> 00:39.956
"Shitty job or not,
if you're reaching out to us,

00:40.040 --> 00:41.875
then you must have something
you want to say."

00:41.958 --> 00:44.127
-That could get him to talk.
-[Sam] Yeah. I like that.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.628
-[Peter] Yeah? Okay.
-For sure, yeah.

00:46.337 --> 00:48.923
How about this? "Shitty job or not,
if you're reaching out to us,

00:49.007 --> 00:51.051
you must have something to say,
so say it."

00:51.134 --> 00:53.595
Maybe the "so say it" is too aggressive.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.972
-I think it's too aggressive.
-Not at all, I love that.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.224
If anything, it should be,
"If you're reaching out to us,

00:58.308 --> 01:00.769
you must have something to say,
so say it, bitch."

01:01.603 --> 01:03.396
-That's too much.
-That's way too much.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.607
Do it without it,
but that's, like, what it sounds like.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.485
Okay, "You must have something to say,
so say it."

01:08.568 --> 01:09.402
Send it, dude.

01:09.486 --> 01:12.030
[keyboard clicking]

01:12.113 --> 01:14.407
-All right, now we just wait.
-Is it sent?

01:14.699 --> 01:15.533
Okay.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.036
[Peter] Hmm.

01:18.369 --> 01:20.872
[indistinct background chatter]

01:21.206 --> 01:22.207
[phone chimes]

01:22.707 --> 01:24.000
[Peter] Dude, he messaged back.

01:24.584 --> 01:25.668
[Sam] Huh?

01:26.127 --> 01:28.088
"Meet me at 47.9."

01:28.338 --> 01:30.048
Look, dude, those are coordinates.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.133
Those are coordinates.

01:32.717 --> 01:35.970
Okay, tell--
Tell him we're coming then. Let's go.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.141
[Peter] Oh, dude, look. Eww.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.061
[Sam] That's definitely poop, yeah.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.313
I don't think he's here, man.

01:45.396 --> 01:46.606
[Peter sighs]

01:47.774 --> 01:50.193
[Peter] I'm gonna text him
and tell him that we're here.

01:50.276 --> 01:53.154
You know, we're within 150 meters
of Kevin's house.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.907
-[message sent chime]
-[Peter] All right.

01:56.574 --> 01:57.492
Oh, he responded.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.119
What'd he say?

01:59.244 --> 02:01.246
"Time to get your hands dirty, Peter."

02:01.955 --> 02:03.748
-No way. Let me see.
-Oh, no!

02:04.499 --> 02:06.209
You think he hid something in there?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.711
[Sam] You should definitely dig
to find out.

02:08.795 --> 02:09.879
[Peter] No, you dig.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.840
-No, the message says...
-Doesn't say who digs.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.175
It says, "Time to get
your hands dirty, Peter."

02:17.679 --> 02:18.680
[sniffles]

02:20.014 --> 02:22.517
[Sam] I'm gonna take
a few steps back. Jeez.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.518
[sniffles]

02:24.769 --> 02:26.688
That is way too big to be dog shit.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.109
[Peter] What the hell. There's...

02:34.237 --> 02:35.530
There's nothing in here.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.575
-[Sam] Yeah.
-What was the point of this?

02:38.658 --> 02:41.786
I think he just wanted you
to dig through shit with chopsticks.

02:43.329 --> 02:44.581
[Sam chuckles]

02:47.375 --> 02:49.377
[intro music playing]

03:25.121 --> 03:27.207
[Peter] In the seven weeks
after the Brownout,

03:27.290 --> 03:30.335
the Turd Burglar avoided
direct contact with everyone.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.670
Ignoring DMs from the police...

03:32.754 --> 03:35.840
To date, police say they have not yet been
able to communicate with the culprit.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.133
[Peter] Other students...

03:37.217 --> 03:38.927
[girl] A bunch of us tried to message him,

03:39.010 --> 03:40.720
but he never DM'd or followed anyone back.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.847
[Peter] And over a dozen from myself.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.184
It wasn't until I confronted
DeMarcus in person

03:46.267 --> 03:48.895
that the Turd Burglar decided
to break the silence...

03:48.978 --> 03:51.773
-[phone buzzes]
-...reaching out to me the very next day

03:51.856 --> 03:55.401
with four direct messages
that led me to digging through poop.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.028
[Sam] That's definitely poop, yeah.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.282
[Peter] Does this sudden contact point
to DeMarcus being the Turd Burglar?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.117
'Cause I'm Mr. Untouchable.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.078
[Peter] Could DeMarcus
feel so untouchable...

04:05.161 --> 04:06.204
I'm here for you, Pete!

04:06.287 --> 04:08.581
Let me know when you need something!
I'm an open book!

04:08.665 --> 04:10.667
[Peter] ...that even after
I confronted him,

04:10.750 --> 04:12.669
he would still taunt me through DMs

04:12.752 --> 04:15.004
and agree to sit down
for further interviews?

04:15.713 --> 04:17.715
And if Kevin was the Turd Burglar,

04:18.007 --> 04:21.719
why, after all we've done for him,
would he make me dig through poop?

04:22.887 --> 04:23.930
Either way,

04:24.013 --> 04:26.474
having an open line of communication
with the Turd Burglar...

04:26.557 --> 04:27.809
Oh, he responded.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.269
...was an enormous victory.

04:30.061 --> 04:33.356
Because while four DMs
may not seem like a big deal,

04:33.439 --> 04:36.359
it was adding
to a growing pile of digital clues

04:36.442 --> 04:39.654
that brought us closer to finding
the Turd Burglar's identity.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.491
Some of these digital clues
are easy to interpret.

04:43.741 --> 04:45.827
For instance, the Turd Burglar account

04:45.910 --> 04:48.997
contains reposted pictures of the Brownout

04:49.080 --> 04:51.541
with tags to dozens of students
in the school.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.918
I got tagged in a video
by the Turd Burglar.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.295
I got tagged in a video.

04:55.378 --> 04:58.798
He knew just about everybody
that shit themselves that day.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.718
[Peter] So we know that the Turd Burglar
must be someone

05:01.801 --> 05:04.095
with a working knowledge
of the student body.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.890
But some of these digital clues
are harder to make sense of,

05:08.516 --> 05:10.476
raising questions that we can't answer.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.563
Like the Turd Burglar's final two posts.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.357
One of Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo,

05:16.816 --> 05:18.484
and one of an advent calendar

05:18.735 --> 05:20.361
with the date December 4th.

05:21.029 --> 05:25.074
They seem to be warning of a crime
on the 4th that never took place,

05:25.783 --> 05:29.329
and they were posted after Kevin
was put on house arrest.

05:29.829 --> 05:33.291
[Sam] Okay, so I think Kevin posted these
after he was put on house arrest

05:33.374 --> 05:36.627
to make it look like he was innocent,
like the Turd Burglar was still out there.

05:36.711 --> 05:40.465
And since he was on house arrest,
there was no aftermath post,

05:40.548 --> 05:41.841
no evidence of a fourth crime,

05:41.924 --> 05:43.885
because Kevin wasn't in school to do it.

05:44.218 --> 05:48.014
You have to admit that that's still
the strongest argument against Kevin.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.224
Yeah, but you could also
look at it the other way,

05:50.308 --> 05:53.186
that he wouldn't warn of a crime
knowing that he couldn't do it.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.271
[Sam] No, he's thinking
we would think that,

05:55.355 --> 05:57.023
and then he wouldn't do that, you know?

05:57.106 --> 06:00.151
No, these are warning posts.
Whoever posted these thought

06:00.234 --> 06:02.362
they'd be able to pull off a crime
and then failed.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.571
That wouldn't be Kevin,

06:03.654 --> 06:05.948
'cause Kevin was already
under house arrest at the time.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.868
-So, you think DeMarcus?
-Yes.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.912
To me there's just so much against him.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.831
He thought he could commit a fourth crime,
but for some reason he failed.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.167
[Peter] Clearly, Sam and I couldn't agree

06:16.250 --> 06:19.295
on whether the multiple
December 4th warning posts

06:19.379 --> 06:22.423
were more damning for Kevin or DeMarcus.

06:23.174 --> 06:26.094
But there are plenty of other
digital clues to break down.

06:26.427 --> 06:27.553
For example,

06:27.637 --> 06:30.973
did the Turd Burglar messages
seem like they could be written

06:31.057 --> 06:32.392
by DeMarcus Tillman?

06:32.725 --> 06:35.061
[Sam] Just look at the way
the Turd Burglar talks.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.813
"Time to remove the veil."

06:37.271 --> 06:39.482
That doesn't sound like DeMarcus at all.

06:39.565 --> 06:40.483
Like, at all.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.693
And then, over here, um...

06:43.069 --> 06:45.655
"Within the confines of this school,
you'll find a lot of shitheads.

06:45.738 --> 06:46.572
[Peter] Yeah.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.617
DeMarcus gets along
with everybody at the school.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.412
[Peter] Sam's right.
It doesn't sound like him.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.956
I want all y'all to go home,
get you some pussy.

06:55.039 --> 06:56.999
Squeaky, go get your dick...
Do whatever you do.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.544
I love this dude, man.
I love this dude even more.

07:00.086 --> 07:03.047
I even love this dude. He tie his shoes
like he work at Footlocker.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.508
-[Sam] He doesn't think they're shitheads.
-[Peter] Right.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.135
And you're 100% right about that,

07:07.218 --> 07:09.178
it doesn't sound like him,
but you have to remember

07:09.262 --> 07:10.972
that if it is DeMarcus,

07:11.055 --> 07:13.766
he would be actively trying
to not sound like himself.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.602
He'd be trying to throw us,
trying to throw his voice.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.983
[Hannah] Individuals who are attempting
to disguise their online presence

07:22.066 --> 07:25.111
will alter their use
of linguistic features.

07:25.194 --> 07:28.698
This is common in the real world,
in the way we use language.

07:28.781 --> 07:32.785
We refer to these processes
as "code switching" or "style shifting."

07:33.286 --> 07:35.455
[Peter] And we've seen
code switching before

07:35.538 --> 07:37.123
in very obvious ways.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.667
With his Sir Fuxalot prank,

07:39.750 --> 07:41.794
DeMarcus' idol, Perry Coleman,

07:41.878 --> 07:44.839
would talk in Old English,
saying things like,

07:44.922 --> 07:49.469
"Sad that mine own mistress Paige Burton
won't sucketh mine on dick."

07:50.011 --> 07:52.096
And we've seen more subtle code switching

07:52.180 --> 07:54.599
from DeMarcus' own texts and social media.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.350
Look at these text messages.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.728
When he talks
to his Rainier Beach friends,

07:58.811 --> 08:01.856
his, you know, his city friends,
he uses his slang.

08:01.939 --> 08:04.400
In responding to a message,
he writes, "FRFR."

08:04.484 --> 08:05.818
"For real, for real."

08:05.902 --> 08:07.570
And then when you look at this message,

08:07.653 --> 08:09.780
when he's talking
to his St. Bernardine friends,

08:09.864 --> 08:11.699
he responds saying, "Forsure."

08:11.782 --> 08:14.285
So it's clear that DeMarcus
can sound like different people.

08:14.952 --> 08:16.996
I've known DeMarcus
since we were little kids.

08:17.079 --> 08:19.916
I'm-- I mean, I don't want to say
when he's at St. Bernardine

08:19.999 --> 08:23.211
that he talks whiter, but he talks whiter.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.796
It is what it is. We all gotta do it.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.132
[DeMarcus]
Yeah, I talk different to people here.

08:28.424 --> 08:31.302
It's like, I'm not trying to say
the n-word at St. Bernie's.

08:31.385 --> 08:33.429
Like, one time I slipped up, right?

08:33.721 --> 08:36.015
And I could just see
their little white kids' gears turning.

08:36.098 --> 08:37.099
They just looking at me.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.101
In they eyes,
I could read what they was thinking.

08:39.185 --> 08:41.395
Like, "Can I say it next? Is it cool?" No.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.480
Nope.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.024
So it's clear that DeMarcus
can sound like different people.

08:45.149 --> 08:47.693
So if he can sound like different people
in his text messages,

08:47.777 --> 08:50.780
then he can sound like different
people as the Turd Burglar.

08:51.989 --> 08:55.493
[Peter] It makes sense that DeMarcus
would throw his voice to avoid detection.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.578
But what if he made mistakes?

08:58.329 --> 09:00.373
Could he have left traces of his own style

09:00.456 --> 09:02.124
when writing as the Turd Burglar?

09:03.125 --> 09:05.002
Look at this post from September 6th.

09:05.795 --> 09:09.215
"Asian Josh puts a grimace emoji
on my face.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.968
#HeReallyMexicanTho."

09:12.718 --> 09:14.679
It seems clear he meant to say,

09:14.762 --> 09:17.306
"Asian Josh puts a smile on my face,"

09:17.723 --> 09:19.183
but misused the emoji.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.227
On November 2nd,

09:21.435 --> 09:24.981
it seems like the Turd Burglar
misused the same emoji

09:25.273 --> 09:26.232
when he wrote,

09:26.315 --> 09:28.859
"Grimace and say cheese."

09:29.110 --> 09:31.612
Look at the way he uses the grimace face,
those gritted teeth.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.240
So what are the odds
that two different people

09:34.323 --> 09:36.409
both mistake the grimace for a smiley?

09:36.492 --> 09:38.202
You have to admit that that looks bad.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.080
The grimace face felt like a huge break,

09:41.664 --> 09:44.625
an undeniable tie between DeMarcus
and the Turd Burglar.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.336
But that same grimace face

09:47.420 --> 09:48.963
uncovered another fact.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.174
A fact that I had to admit
through gritted teeth of my own.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.552
[Sam] Yeah, I'll give you
the grimace, but...

09:54.635 --> 09:56.554
[sighs] How do you explain the glitch?

09:57.138 --> 09:58.306
[Peter] DeMarcus...

09:58.931 --> 10:00.349
didn't have the glitch.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.440
In November of 2017,

10:07.523 --> 10:12.737
iPhone users experienced a glitch
when updating to iOS 11.1.

10:12.820 --> 10:16.282
Well, there were, like, three weeks
where it was super annoying.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.451
I had to restructure my sentences.

10:18.743 --> 10:21.245
I ended up talking in the third person
like some kind of idiot.

10:21.329 --> 10:24.165
It was like we were all talking
in robot code for a week.

10:24.248 --> 10:26.959
[Peter] It was an issue
specific to the keyboard.

10:27.168 --> 10:30.379
Uppercase I would be autocorrected
to the letter A

10:30.463 --> 10:32.673
and a question mark in a box.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.635
For example, if you were texting a friend,

10:35.718 --> 10:37.261
"I was so drunk last night,"

10:37.345 --> 10:41.140
it would read,
"A? was so drunk last night."

10:41.641 --> 10:44.977
This glitch caused a significant uproar
in the iPhone community

10:45.061 --> 10:47.188
and even sparked a series of memes.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.232
We can see that on November 2nd,

10:50.316 --> 10:53.235
the Turd Burglar had the Apple iOS glitch,

10:53.903 --> 10:55.321
but DeMarcus didn't.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.531
So the Turd Burglar posts

10:57.615 --> 11:00.242
couldn't have been made
from DeMarcus' phone.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.912
I mean, I don't think DeMarcus
would fake that.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.956
That's next level code switching
if he did.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.084
[Peter] No, you're right. I mean,

11:08.167 --> 11:10.461
every single time I'm convinced
that he's the Turd Burglar,

11:10.544 --> 11:12.880
I come back to the fact
that he doesn't have the glitch.

11:12.963 --> 11:14.924
[Sam] And why are we
investigating him anyways?

11:15.383 --> 11:18.636
Because Chloe supposedly
saw the Turd Burglar card in his wallet?

11:18.719 --> 11:20.137
[Peter] That's no small thing.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.890
She said that she saw the card.
He's the Turd Burglar.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.226
[Sam] Okay, but Gonzo said
it was just a yogurt card.

11:25.309 --> 11:26.644
It wasn't the Turd Burglar card.

11:26.727 --> 11:28.979
It was the Yummy Swirl Yogurt card.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.774
[Peter] Okay, but he's obviously lying
to protect his teammate.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.776
[Sam] Sure, and Chloe
could be lying too, dude.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.361
It was DeMarcus Tillman.

11:35.444 --> 11:36.445
Lying about what?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.239
I saw the Turd Burglar card in there.

11:38.322 --> 11:40.282
What, do you think she's involved in this?

11:40.366 --> 11:42.827
Her service club alibi checked out,
and she'd have to be crazy

11:42.910 --> 11:45.079
to be letting us stay in her house
if she was guilty!

11:45.162 --> 11:47.748
-When did I say I thought she's involved?
-Then what are you saying?

11:47.832 --> 11:49.125
I think she's biased.

11:50.084 --> 11:53.546
For reasons that I don't understand,
'cause Kevin kinda fuckin' sucks.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.548
[Peter] Sam brings up a good point.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.925
Not about Kevin sucking,

11:58.008 --> 12:00.386
but about Chloe
having a reason to be biased.

12:01.345 --> 12:03.597
Could she just be protecting a friend?

12:04.348 --> 12:06.267
How deep do their roots run?

12:07.435 --> 12:09.854
So, I met Kevin in the fourth grade.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.691
[Kevin] Chloe was new at school that year.

12:14.024 --> 12:18.070
I first took notice of her at recess.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.739
She was by herself.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.533
I decided to provide her with company.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.953
[Chloe] We used to play Angry Birds
all the time

12:26.036 --> 12:28.706
on this old iPod Touch of mine.

12:28.789 --> 12:31.751
It's a childish game,
but we were young and...

12:33.169 --> 12:34.211
it was quite a trip.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.714
[Chloe] We just loved Angry Birds,

12:36.797 --> 12:39.341
and we got really, really into it
that whole year.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.385
If ever we got stuck on something,

12:41.469 --> 12:43.053
we would just blame the creators

12:43.137 --> 12:45.306
and basically send prank emails to them.

12:45.723 --> 12:46.807
It was pretty funny.

12:47.224 --> 12:50.686
[Kevin] To a casual observer,
we might have looked like lovebirds.

12:51.395 --> 12:54.815
Ironic that it all started with us
playing Angry Birds.

12:55.566 --> 12:56.692
[Chloe] In my family,

12:57.026 --> 12:58.986
we're a pretty traditional family,

12:59.236 --> 13:01.655
and so by the time I was in sixth grade,

13:01.739 --> 13:05.785
I knew it was either lawyer, doctor,
or engineer for my future career.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.828
And then one day,

13:08.954 --> 13:10.456
Kevin overheard me singing.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.292
[Kevin] She was singing
"Party in the USA."

13:14.126 --> 13:16.879
In public. Softly, but still.

13:17.838 --> 13:21.801
That song is the bubonic plague of sound.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.012
[Kevin] He turned around and he said

13:25.095 --> 13:28.140
the nicest thing that Kevin
is capable of saying.

13:28.724 --> 13:29.683
[Kevin] I told her this.

13:30.726 --> 13:34.313
"That song is an ocular catastrophe,

13:34.814 --> 13:37.483
but you make it sound just perfect."

13:38.484 --> 13:39.735
It's the truth. She did.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.530
I googled "ocular" that night.

13:43.697 --> 13:46.158
He used the word wrong,
but it was really sweet.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.662
[choir vocalizing]

13:49.995 --> 13:51.997
[Chloe] I had always wanted to sing,

13:52.706 --> 13:55.793
but I didn't really have the confidence
to tell anyone.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.421
But Kevin said I sounded perfect, so...

14:00.130 --> 14:02.550
[choir vocalizing]

14:02.633 --> 14:03.843
[Kevin] Yeah, Chloe!

14:04.927 --> 14:06.303
Boo, everyone else!

14:07.304 --> 14:09.473
[Chloe] I'm applying
to the Berklee School of Music.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.060
My singing coach thinks
I have a real shot.

14:13.644 --> 14:14.979
Her talent was undeniable.

14:15.062 --> 14:18.524
I mean, without so much as an audition,
I introduced her to Tanner.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.609
It was just, she had to be in the band.

14:22.319 --> 14:25.656
[girl] So, from fifth to eighth grade,
it was, like, the three of them.

14:25.739 --> 14:29.326
Then we all just started to realize
that the Horsehead Collective, um...

14:29.410 --> 14:31.245
that their music was shitty,

14:31.328 --> 14:32.997
and they just drifted apart.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.500
Yeah, and then I guess Chloe
started to make more friends.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.335
She made the basketball team.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.131
[girl] I give Chloe credit for hanging out
with Kevin as long as she did.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.632
Chloe's cool.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.259
And, I mean, Kevin, he's...

14:45.676 --> 14:47.511
he's cool in his own way.

14:47.595 --> 14:48.971
[guy] Hey, Fruit Ninja!

14:49.847 --> 14:50.806
But, you know,

14:51.348 --> 14:52.558
he's the Fruit Ninja.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.769
We still hung out sometimes
in high school.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.480
I really enjoyed hanging out one-on-one,

14:59.148 --> 15:01.400
but in groups he could be...

15:01.817 --> 15:02.985
a little tough.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.071
They hear "EDM" and they think "techno,"

15:06.155 --> 15:09.658
but techno could not be farther
from what good...

15:09.742 --> 15:12.661
[girl] It got to the point where
if Chloe was coming out...

15:12.745 --> 15:13.621
[phone buzzes]

15:13.704 --> 15:16.373
...we had to explicitly say
not to invite Kevin.

15:16.457 --> 15:20.711
[phone buzzes intermittently]

15:20.794 --> 15:24.131
[Kevin] It was alright that we didn't
hang out as much anymore.

15:24.214 --> 15:28.886
I mean, honestly, the Horsehead
was evolving past vocals anyway.

15:29.261 --> 15:32.473
[Chloe] I do feel guilty that I stopped
inviting him to things,

15:32.556 --> 15:36.393
but it just didn't seem like
he wanted to go to anything.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.104
So...

15:39.688 --> 15:40.564
yeah.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.864
[Peter] So we're just confused
about one thing, so just bear with me.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.451
If you first saw the Turd Burglar card
in DeMarcus' wallet on November 9th,

15:52.534 --> 15:56.246
then why did you wait two weeks
until November 22nd to say something?

15:56.330 --> 15:58.207
The day after Kevin was expelled?

15:59.541 --> 16:00.751
Because I...

16:01.919 --> 16:04.880
I didn't want to snitch,
I mean, on DeMarcus Tillman...

16:06.256 --> 16:07.800
[crowd cheers]

16:07.883 --> 16:09.385
...if I didn't have to.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.471
I mean, you could've stopped
two more Turd Burglar crimes.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.640
-You see what we're saying?
-[Chloe] Yeah, it's...

16:14.723 --> 16:16.475
[Peter] It's just that...

16:16.558 --> 16:18.560
I just-- It didn't feel like, my place.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.437
-You know?
-Mm-hmm.

16:20.521 --> 16:21.772
Until Kevin got accused.

16:21.855 --> 16:24.984
Kevin, here's the thing.
We know you did it.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.195
I knew that he didn't do it
and that's why I came forward.

16:28.278 --> 16:30.531
Because you guys are friends... right?

16:30.614 --> 16:32.491
[Chloe] Well, we're not even
that close anymore.

16:32.574 --> 16:33.575
It's more that...

16:34.368 --> 16:37.413
Okay, if Kevin accused DeMarcus...

16:37.496 --> 16:40.082
-[Peter] Okay.
-And Kevin was actually the Turd Burglar,

16:40.165 --> 16:41.834
I would have done the same thing.

16:42.793 --> 16:46.380
[Peter] If Chloe is lying about seeing
the card in DeMarcus' wallet,

16:46.463 --> 16:49.675
could the fact that DeMarcus
didn't have the glitch

16:49.758 --> 16:51.677
be enough to prove his innocence?

16:51.844 --> 16:54.179
It seems like the Turd Burglar account

16:54.263 --> 16:56.598
couldn't have been run
through DeMarcus' phone.

16:57.099 --> 17:00.811
But there's plenty of evidence supporting
Kevin's innocence as well.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.063
We know Kevin pooped himself.

17:03.355 --> 17:06.150
We know he couldn't have bought maltitol
from Dawsey's.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.736
We also know that,

17:08.819 --> 17:09.903
like DeMarcus,

17:10.029 --> 17:12.406
Kevin didn't have the glitch.

17:12.489 --> 17:13.657
I have an Android.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.910
It's the superior machine.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.496
If I wanted to be limited

17:19.580 --> 17:21.957
to only the approved apps

17:22.332 --> 17:25.169
available in the iTunes App Store,

17:26.253 --> 17:27.671
I'd buy an iPhone.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.965
The glitch threw us a curve ball.

17:30.215 --> 17:33.260
[Peter] For the first time,
I had to ask myself:

17:33.552 --> 17:36.764
What if the Turd Burglar
wasn't Kevin McLean

17:36.847 --> 17:38.223
or DeMarcus Tillman?

17:38.891 --> 17:40.476
We had to widen our scope.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.978
We know that the Turd Burglar

17:43.062 --> 17:45.564
has a working knowledge
of the student body,

17:45.647 --> 17:47.357
so that's where we went next.

17:47.941 --> 17:50.402
The student government's anonymous tip box

17:50.819 --> 17:52.905
to see who else could have had a motive,

17:52.988 --> 17:55.032
who else had the iOS glitch,

17:55.532 --> 17:57.493
and who else could be a suspect.

17:57.993 --> 18:00.537
So this tip box is what
the student government did,

18:00.621 --> 18:03.040
you know, when it was
kind of desperate for anything,

18:03.123 --> 18:05.959
and according to them, a lot of these
are incredibly unhelpful.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.462
But I think that there might be
some gems in here,

18:08.545 --> 18:11.590
so we're gonna go through these
for the rest of the day,

18:11.673 --> 18:13.717
and because of that I have dubbed today,

18:13.801 --> 18:15.052
"Just the Tip Day."

18:15.135 --> 18:19.056
Let's do un-useful and useful.
We'll make two piles.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.976
[Peter] At first, it seemed like
the student government was right.

18:23.310 --> 18:25.104
Most were just crude jokes and drawings.

18:25.187 --> 18:28.899
Yeah, see, this is an example of something
that's definitely not useful.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.400
"Your mom poops."

18:30.484 --> 18:33.237
This is the second one for Russell Wilson.
Do you know who that is?

18:33.320 --> 18:36.198
Yeah, that's the quarterback
for the Seahawks.

18:36.657 --> 18:37.533
Oh.

18:38.117 --> 18:38.951
So, yeah.

18:39.034 --> 18:41.411
There's another Russell Wilson
in there, though.

18:41.745 --> 18:44.123
But then we started to see
some recurring names,

18:44.373 --> 18:47.376
including four students
with five or more mentions.

18:47.751 --> 18:50.254
We crosschecked these names
with their social media

18:50.337 --> 18:53.090
to see which of these potential suspects
had the glitch.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.216
Three of them did.

18:54.675 --> 18:57.761
Paul Schnorrenberg, Diapey Drew,
and Jenna Hawthorne.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.055
We're going to take a closer look
into these three people.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.056
We'll start with those.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.143
[applause]

19:04.226 --> 19:06.145
[girl] Drew Pankratz is a nice kid.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.688
He's in all the plays.

19:09.731 --> 19:12.943
He's that sort of dude where, like,
all his friends were theater girls.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.280
[boy] He's a theater kid who lives
in the friend zone,

19:16.363 --> 19:19.158
and when I got grounded for smoking dabs
in my garage,

19:19.241 --> 19:21.285
I let him take my girlfriend
to Homecoming.

19:21.368 --> 19:24.913
-'Cause... it's Drew.
-[girlfriend] He's like a brother to me.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.040
My parents let him sleep over
all the time.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.084
Like, I can change in front of him.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.211
That's how asexual the situation is.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.504
The kid is no threat.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.756
Or at least, that's what I thought.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.176
[Tanner] And then the pictures came out.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.595
Somebody posted them
on the school message boards.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.555
Everybody saw them.

19:42.598 --> 19:43.682
Phew.

19:43.765 --> 19:47.978
There were picture leaks of him in,
like, diapers, with baby bottles.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.397
I'm not sure if it's some sort
of weird fetish.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.566
I just really want to know who it was for.

19:52.649 --> 19:56.153
[guy] Honestly, I thought he might be gay,
and then I saw those pictures.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.155
I guess-- I don't know,
I still don't know.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.365
[Drew] I was pushing myself as an actor.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.576
It was just a diaper.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.578
Just for a character, you know?

20:04.661 --> 20:07.456
It wasn't some kink
like everyone's saying.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.708
[girl] I mean, I felt bad, because...

20:10.209 --> 20:12.085
Drew's the nicest guy ever.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.838
Honestly, I made it the background
on my phone.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.132
But those pictures were really funny.

20:17.841 --> 20:20.260
[Tanner] When all the Turd Burglar stuff
started happening,

20:21.011 --> 20:24.431
I was like, "That's Drew getting back
at us for all the diaper stuff."

20:24.514 --> 20:26.600
And honestly, I wouldn't blame him.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.728
-[applause, chanting] ♪ Diapey Drew! ♪
-[Drew] I'm not the Turd Burglar.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.648
I just want people to leave me alone.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.359
[Peter] Do you think that it's possible
that Drew Pankratz

20:35.442 --> 20:37.694
-could be the Turd Burglar?
-No.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.739
Drew Pankratz has
a potentially strong motive.

20:41.281 --> 20:42.783
And he had the glitch.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.826
But he also has an alibi.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.038
I know Drew Pankratz
isn't the Turd Burglar, it's impossible.

20:49.206 --> 20:52.417
During the fire drill, the one
where the lemonade was contaminated,

20:52.501 --> 20:56.213
he was here with me, in the library.
He's always reading,

20:56.296 --> 20:58.423
and I'm one of the only people
he talks to anymore.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.176
I knew it was a drill,
so I just stayed here and let him read.

21:01.718 --> 21:04.346
For that matter, he was here
during the pep rally too.

21:04.429 --> 21:07.557
Once those diaper pictures hit,
with the bottle, he just... [inhales]

21:08.141 --> 21:10.811
He hasn't been the same
and he couldn't face the whole school.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.605
What these kids are doing is pretty awful.

21:14.231 --> 21:17.484
[Peter] With limited opportunity
and the librarian vouching for him,

21:18.068 --> 21:20.153
Diapey Drew passed our sniff test.

21:22.447 --> 21:25.075
[boy] A lot of kids at this school
have a house as nice as Jenna's,

21:25.158 --> 21:26.618
or a car as expensive as hers.

21:27.411 --> 21:30.163
Not everybody has a library
named after them.

21:30.622 --> 21:31.832
That's fuck-you money.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.877
[Kevin] I don't trust anyone that rich.

21:35.961 --> 21:39.548
People with that kind of wealth
think that rules don't apply to them,

21:39.631 --> 21:42.759
and they, frankly, probably don't.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.678
Jenna's Instagram was perfect.

21:44.761 --> 21:47.014
Like, she was traveling
with her girlfriend,

21:47.097 --> 21:50.642
taking pictures of them kissing at sunset
on a yacht in Mykonos.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.437
Her Instagram was full of pictures
that were clearly taken

21:53.520 --> 21:55.272
from professional photographers.

21:55.522 --> 21:56.523
[girl] Jenna easily had

21:56.606 --> 22:00.402
the most obnoxiously perfect
Instagram account at this school,

22:01.320 --> 22:02.821
and then she posts this picture

22:02.904 --> 22:05.615
claiming to be best friends
with Kendall Jenner.

22:06.491 --> 22:09.286
Then someone found
the un-cropped version of that picture.

22:09.995 --> 22:14.041
Turns out she was just waiting five hours
for a Kendall meet-up.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.043
She was not her best friend.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.671
Obviously it wasn't real.
She ended up coming out

22:19.755 --> 22:23.091
that she waited five hours in line
for this autograph.

22:23.633 --> 22:27.721
And that doesn't make you her best friend,
it kind of makes you a loser. [chuckles]

22:27.804 --> 22:31.099
No, I don't hate the kids here.
I just, like...

22:31.475 --> 22:33.852
Honestly, they're not really
worth my time.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.772
What she did
was pretty lame in my book. Um...

22:37.773 --> 22:40.692
She tried to fake a relationship,
like she was friends with Kendall,

22:40.776 --> 22:42.778
when really she just, like,
took a fan picture.

22:42.861 --> 22:45.906
I feel like she low-key
disrespected everyone

22:45.989 --> 22:48.116
who Kendall really has
a relationship with,

22:48.200 --> 22:49.993
like her actual family.

22:50.077 --> 22:53.538
Like, Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, um...

22:53.622 --> 22:56.541
Kylie, Kylie baby daddy, the new baby...

22:56.666 --> 22:58.043
um, Tyga...

22:58.126 --> 23:01.505
Ah, all of them, man.
The mom, the transgender mom,

23:01.713 --> 23:02.756
the little babies.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.383
Like, she just shouldn't have done it.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.718
She should have just said,
"Hey, I met Kendall.

23:08.178 --> 23:09.096
Emoji."

23:09.971 --> 23:12.349
[Peter] Do you sometimes regret
posting that picture?

23:12.891 --> 23:14.810
Yeah. I mean... [sighs]

23:15.435 --> 23:17.312
It's just silly because, like,

23:17.562 --> 23:20.607
it was a joke, you know what I mean?
It wasn't supposed to--

23:20.690 --> 23:25.070
I see so many people post pictures
with, like, celebrities all the time,

23:25.153 --> 23:26.029
so, like,

23:26.446 --> 23:28.198
maybe it's just because, like,

23:28.448 --> 23:31.701
there's a certain attitude about me
at this school...

23:32.994 --> 23:36.832
that people just got jealous or something
and blew it way out of proportion.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.500
So, yeah.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.252
[girl] I hate to admit it,

23:40.877 --> 23:43.046
but it's kind of fun

23:43.547 --> 23:45.924
watching someone so perfect
fall from the top.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.385
[Peter] And it's a long way to fall.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.971
In a school full of affluent families,

23:51.221 --> 23:53.306
the Hawthorne family is the wealthiest.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.392
In 2017,

23:55.475 --> 23:58.562
Nicro, a chemical company
owned by her parents,

23:58.645 --> 24:01.064
brought in over US$ 6 billion in sales.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.608
So, Jenna's family's company Nicro

24:03.692 --> 24:05.902
releases an annual product revenue report,

24:05.986 --> 24:07.904
and look at one of the products is.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.365
[Sam] Maltitol.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.868
-Really?
-Industrial quantities of it.

24:12.951 --> 24:13.994
[Sam laughing] What?

24:14.077 --> 24:18.290
But she does intern there, so maybe
Nicro actually gives her an alibi.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.292
Jenna's internship?

24:21.418 --> 24:23.712
Yeah, that's a perk not even
my family can afford.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.923
While the rest of us are working hard,
Jenna gets 4.0's is on her transcripts

24:27.007 --> 24:27.924
for leaving early.

24:28.383 --> 24:32.429
So, Jenna claims that she goes
to an internship a few times a week.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.473
Is that correct from your understanding?

24:34.556 --> 24:35.432
Yes.

24:35.515 --> 24:38.059
Nicro, her family company,
the chemical company.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.812
But I can double check if you want
to see the exact dates.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.105
Yeah, that'd be great.

24:42.272 --> 24:45.525
-Jenna... Hawthorne...
-[keyboard clattering]

24:46.276 --> 24:47.486
Okay, here we are.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.864
Yes, every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,

24:50.947 --> 24:53.116
she signs out with us at 11 a.m.,

24:53.366 --> 24:56.453
and then every Friday we get a record
of her internship hours,

24:56.536 --> 24:58.455
and then we just add it to her transcript.

24:58.538 --> 25:00.123
Do you mind if I see her hours

25:00.207 --> 25:02.459
for the second and third week
in November? Perfect

25:02.542 --> 25:05.504
This means Jenna wasn't even
at St. Bernardine

25:05.587 --> 25:07.797
during the critical fire alarm
before the Brownout,

25:08.298 --> 25:11.176
or right before the pep rally
to load the Shit Launchers,

25:11.593 --> 25:14.346
and the school has the documentation
to prove it.

25:14.888 --> 25:17.098
Another student with a strong motive,

25:17.516 --> 25:19.267
but an equally strong alibi.

25:21.311 --> 25:24.439
There are a lot of very religious...

25:25.482 --> 25:27.234
students at St. Bernardine,

25:27.317 --> 25:32.447
but none are
Paul Schnorrenberg-level religious.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.742
[Paul] I think it's very funny,

25:35.825 --> 25:39.037
like, how some of my teachers,
in my Catholic school,

25:39.120 --> 25:42.165
talk about their "interpretations"
of God's words.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.501
Well, this is a Catholic school,

25:44.834 --> 25:47.379
but Paul does go a bit overboard.

25:48.046 --> 25:49.130
It's God's words!

25:49.214 --> 25:51.341
He wrote them for us. It's right here.

25:51.424 --> 25:54.302
Even Jesus would tell Paul
to take it down a notch.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.887
Jesus Boy, yeah.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.265
Yo, I respect that kid.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.976
He put in a lot of hours,
a lot of hard work into,

26:01.059 --> 26:03.520
you know, like, God stuff,
the same way I do on the court,

26:03.603 --> 26:06.106
so I gotta take my hat off to him,
'cause...

26:06.731 --> 26:09.943
Like, the Bible is so boring.

26:10.026 --> 26:11.903
Like, no disrespect. It's just like...

26:12.988 --> 26:14.614
I don't know, when you start reading it,

26:14.698 --> 26:16.366
you naturally start falling asleep,

26:16.449 --> 26:19.911
but Paul, yo, he thug through it,
he read that Bible.

26:20.537 --> 26:23.498
So, I gotta respect him. Nah mean?

26:23.582 --> 26:25.834
Premarital sex is a sin.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.963
Sex is sex, no matter what,
under God's eyes.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.007
[man] Let's take a deep breath.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.843
[Mascot Boy] Before Kevin confessed,
that was my best theory.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.053
You know, it was Paul's way
of getting back

26:37.137 --> 26:39.806
and punishing his classmates
who he thought were, like, sinners.

26:40.223 --> 26:43.810
[Paul] God was protecting some of us
from the plagues of the Turd Burglar

26:43.893 --> 26:45.437
while punishing others.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.815
[Peter] A couple of small digital clues
support the idea

26:48.898 --> 26:51.568
that Paul was behind this
poop Judgment Day.

26:52.068 --> 26:54.321
For example, like the Turd Burglar,

26:54.863 --> 26:57.616
Paul uses periods after emojis.

26:57.699 --> 26:59.326
If you look through Paul's Instagram,

26:59.409 --> 27:03.163
he uses periods after emojis in, like,
a lot of his posts.

27:03.246 --> 27:07.375
One, two, three, four, five,

27:07.459 --> 27:10.462
six, six times in 17 posts.

27:10.545 --> 27:11.421
That's weird.

27:11.504 --> 27:13.757
And you also have to remember
the Bible verse--

27:13.840 --> 27:15.050
That really is weird.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.384
Periods after emojis?

27:16.468 --> 27:18.511
-That's, like, serial killer weird.
-[Peter] Right.

27:18.595 --> 27:22.265
And you have to remember the Bible verse
that the Turd Burglar referenced:

27:22.349 --> 27:24.476
"Thou shalt have great disease
of thy bowels

27:24.559 --> 27:26.269
until thy bowels fall out."

27:26.353 --> 27:27.646
-[Sam] Right.
-Think about it.

27:27.729 --> 27:30.273
[Sam] A normal Catholic school student
wouldn't know that.

27:30.357 --> 27:33.526
You'd have to be Schnorrenberg Catholic.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.695
Premarital sex is a sin.

27:36.237 --> 27:37.656
[Peter] There's a motive,

27:37.739 --> 27:41.242
there are small digital clues
connecting him to the Turd Burglar,

27:41.326 --> 27:43.286
and there's even a target.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.330
Paul hates Montgomery. He hates her.

27:45.413 --> 27:47.791
[Paul] This book describes oral sex!

27:47.874 --> 27:50.043
You may as well send us all
pornography websites!

27:50.126 --> 27:53.755
You know, if Kurt Vonnegut was alive,
I think he'd be pleased with this.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.382
Are you out of your mind?

27:55.465 --> 27:57.926
Sometimes I can get frustrated
with Ms. Montgomery.

27:58.009 --> 28:01.096
What is the difference?
Under God's eyes, what is the difference?

28:01.179 --> 28:02.972
Maybe it's not so much about oral sex,

28:03.056 --> 28:04.933
maybe it's about what it represents
in this book.

28:05.016 --> 28:07.310
-You are ridiculous, Ms. Montgomery.
-Ridiculous?

28:07.394 --> 28:09.020
Yes, I like to be ridiculous.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.439
But I would never intentionally
cover anyone in poop.

28:11.523 --> 28:16.695
[thud, screaming]

28:16.986 --> 28:18.446
[Peter] But his potential target...

28:19.114 --> 28:20.490
is also his alibi.

28:20.740 --> 28:23.118
No, I don't think any of my kids
could have done this,

28:23.201 --> 28:24.494
especially Paul.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.079
I think it was a mistake.

28:26.162 --> 28:28.081
[screaming]

28:28.164 --> 28:30.417
I happen to know Paul
isn't the Turd Burglar.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.294
He couldn't have done that horrible thing
with the T-shirt launcher

28:33.378 --> 28:36.506
because I was with him at the time.
We were having one of our...

28:37.507 --> 28:40.260
spirited debates.
We were talking about the Pope.

28:40.343 --> 28:43.304
He thinks the Pope's too radical
and I think he's kinda cool.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.974
He even switched his throne out
for a white chair.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.351
I think he's like Bernie Sanders.

28:48.435 --> 28:51.354
Anyway, we were talking about it
right up until the pep rally,

28:51.438 --> 28:53.148
so I know he didn't do it.

28:53.231 --> 28:54.691
[clapping]

28:54.774 --> 28:58.862
Starting point guard, Lou Carter!

28:58.945 --> 28:59.946
[crowd whooping]

29:00.029 --> 29:01.740
[Paul] Our interview
in Montgomery's office

29:01.823 --> 29:03.658
seemed to play out in a familiar fashion:

29:04.242 --> 29:08.371
An alibi vouching for someone
that we considered promising suspect.

29:08.955 --> 29:12.834
But Ms. Montgomery inviting us into
her office was far from a dead-end,

29:13.543 --> 29:16.296
because something even more important
in the next room...

29:16.379 --> 29:17.422
-Excuse me.
-Take your time.

29:17.505 --> 29:18.715
...caught Sam's eye.

29:20.925 --> 29:23.303
-[Sam] Did you see that?
-What?

29:23.386 --> 29:25.305
-See what?
-[Sam] Uh, hold on.

29:25.388 --> 29:27.682
-[Peter] Dude, what are you doing?
-Just let me do my thing.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.684
-[Peter] No--
-Shut up!

29:30.351 --> 29:32.645
[Sam] Hey, Ms. Montgomery,
you forgot your phone back there.

29:32.729 --> 29:34.689
[woman] Students are not allowed
in this room, Sam.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.317
[Sam] Sorry, I wanted to make sure
she had her phone.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.903
-No, I have my phone.
-[Sam] So-- [laughs]

29:39.986 --> 29:41.404
-[woman] Out.
-This is my phone!

29:41.488 --> 29:44.199
Oh my God, I'm so silly.
Sorry. That's so embarrassing.

29:45.283 --> 29:48.077
[Peter] Remember
the Turd Burglar's final post?

29:48.161 --> 29:51.080
The December 4th post
of a random advent calendar

29:51.164 --> 29:52.665
that we thought was a warning?

29:52.749 --> 29:56.002
These are warning posts.
Whoever posted these thought

29:56.085 --> 29:58.046
they'd be able to pull off
a crime and then failed.

29:58.379 --> 30:02.300
Well, this may not be
a random advent calendar after all.

30:02.759 --> 30:05.011
From Ms. Montgomery's connecting office,

30:05.094 --> 30:08.348
Sam saw an identical calendar
in the faculty lounge,

30:08.723 --> 30:10.225
which could be important.

30:10.725 --> 30:14.729
The Turd Burglar brags about every crime
with an aftermath post.

30:15.355 --> 30:19.692
The lemonade dispenser, the piñata,
the T-shirt launchers...

30:19.776 --> 30:22.445
We call them "delivery devices."

30:23.029 --> 30:26.491
So what if the Turd Burglar
didn't post the advent calendar

30:26.574 --> 30:27.992
to warn of a future crime,

30:28.743 --> 30:30.995
but to brag about a completed one?

30:31.621 --> 30:35.917
What if Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
was the warning post

30:36.251 --> 30:39.504
and the advent calendar
was the delivery device?

30:40.338 --> 30:43.049
What if there was a fourth poop crime?

30:44.425 --> 30:46.344
It would change everything.

30:46.886 --> 30:50.682
Proof of a fourth poop crime
after Kevin was put on house arrest

30:51.182 --> 30:53.226
would expose the school's lies.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.938
It would shatter
the prosecution's narrative.

30:57.397 --> 30:59.315
Proof of a fourth poop crime

30:59.899 --> 31:01.526
would mean that Kevin McClain

31:02.110 --> 31:03.152
is innocent.
