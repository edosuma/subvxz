<i>Suyu District - Seoul Station</i>

01:16.509 --> 01:19.388
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

01:20.547 --> 01:21.548
All right!

01:44.771 --> 01:45.715
Could you...

01:47.207 --> 01:49.551
tell me your name?

01:55.982 --> 01:59.725
You should tell me yours first.
Where are your manners?

02:04.991 --> 02:05.969
Miss!

02:07.861 --> 02:08.999
My name...

02:10.130 --> 02:11.575
My name is...!

02:26.179 --> 02:30.594
<i>SALUT D'AMOUR</i>

<i>KIM Sungchil</i>

02:40.827 --> 02:41.737
Oh, my!

02:48.368 --> 02:50.439
What the hell's going on here?

02:51.171 --> 02:54.243
What are you doing,
blocking off another man's house!

02:54.340 --> 02:56.752
Hey, you!
Move that truck!

02:57.877 --> 02:59.311
Don't you hear me?

02:59.312 --> 03:03.818
If you're going to move,
you should ask permission first!

03:03.983 --> 03:06.361
No manners at all, you people!

03:11.424 --> 03:12.698
Don't worry about him.

03:14.994 --> 03:18.373
You've blocked the entire road!

03:18.565 --> 03:21.239
- I can't believe...!
- Hide and seek!

03:22.802 --> 03:24.839
Where's Da-young?

03:24.938 --> 03:26.474
I'm hiding!

03:27.840 --> 03:28.750
Da-young!

03:30.643 --> 03:33.146
Hurry up and move this truck!

03:33.780 --> 03:36.659
- Or I'll call the district office!
- We'll move it at once.

03:36.749 --> 03:38.922
- Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.

03:41.154 --> 03:44.658
That smell... I caught you!
You ate meat?

03:45.491 --> 03:47.437
No no... it was bacon.

03:47.527 --> 03:52.527
If you cook meat, carbon dioxide
will melt the glaciers faster!

03:52.599 --> 03:53.832
Then what about the polar bears?!

03:53.833 --> 03:56.370
Hey, why aren't you in school?!

04:01.941 --> 04:05.514
Dragon Unit!
Regiment 110, Marine Choi Ho-sup!

04:07.280 --> 04:10.955
- Dragon Unit! Marine...
- You chump!

04:11.050 --> 04:13.997
Don't you know
your regiment number?

04:14.354 --> 04:17.733
You were discharged ages ago,
and still wearing that uniform?

04:18.524 --> 04:23.872
I'm #110, you're #131!

04:24.998 --> 04:25.999
Hey gramps!

04:26.065 --> 04:28.867
You're blocking the damn road
and I can't pass!

04:28.868 --> 04:30.074
Outta the way!

04:32.472 --> 04:34.611
- Gramps!
- Dragon Unit!

<i>KIM Sungchil
Jangsu Mart</i>

04:50.423 --> 04:54.026
These are all about to expire!

04:54.027 --> 04:57.195
I should have gone to
a big chain store.

04:57.196 --> 04:59.267
Thought I'd save some time,
what a mess.

04:59.432 --> 05:00.308
Oh my god!

05:00.900 --> 05:02.208
What are you doing?

05:02.335 --> 05:03.405
Hey, mister!

05:03.703 --> 05:05.080
I'm looking at those!

05:05.171 --> 05:07.014
What's gotten into this guy?

05:08.875 --> 05:13.381
Is this how you treat customers?
Like a piece of crap?

05:14.781 --> 05:17.887
This store is completely crazy!

05:23.222 --> 05:24.890
Hey, Mr. Kim!

05:24.891 --> 05:27.565
Slow down!
I'm not going anywhere.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.936
What is it?
The boss wants you to come.

05:30.029 --> 05:33.875
He can come here.
Young jerk, ordering me around.

05:33.966 --> 05:36.768
No kidding!
I'm busy too, he should come to me.

05:36.769 --> 05:39.875
He's always ordering me around.
Young jerk!

05:40.973 --> 05:43.385
Redevelopment means modernization!

05:43.576 --> 05:47.956
Modernization means bringing
Jangsu Mart into the digital age.

05:48.081 --> 05:51.324
I know why you object to
our district's redevelopment.

05:51.551 --> 05:55.087
Because you're scared,
but don't worry.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.021
As for me,

05:56.022 --> 05:58.901
could I even imagine
Jangsu Mart without you?

05:59.025 --> 06:03.228
All the products in this store
remember your touch.

06:03.229 --> 06:04.563
They need you!

06:04.564 --> 06:05.872
Jangsu Mart is KIM Sungchil!

06:05.932 --> 06:08.572
I'm with you forever.
I am!

06:08.768 --> 06:11.305
Chosen by customers as
Employee of the Month,

06:11.404 --> 06:13.872
two months in a row...

06:13.873 --> 06:16.877
You think I stay
because I've nowhere to go?

06:17.310 --> 06:19.221
I'm a marine.

06:19.812 --> 06:22.088
You think I can't do manual labor?

06:23.449 --> 06:24.950
Wanna arm wrestle?

06:24.951 --> 06:25.784
Calm down, please!

06:25.785 --> 06:28.527
Let's redevelop the boss!

06:32.892 --> 06:35.805
- Your seal... your approval...
- Damn, that's bitter.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.536
Redevelopment Committee Chief,

06:38.631 --> 06:42.701
I'm the owner, but I work the kitchen,
the tables, and do deliveries.

06:42.702 --> 06:43.976
Damn!

06:44.070 --> 06:46.414
And you can't even handle
one old man?

06:48.674 --> 06:51.410
Only thing in
the kitchen is yogurt.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.415
That's my wife's!
Now you're dead.

06:54.514 --> 06:57.349
Is this a cockroach training camp?

06:57.350 --> 07:00.229
Yeah, buy them some clothes.
They're cold.

07:00.286 --> 07:01.890
My wife...

07:02.555 --> 07:05.126
says if I can't send her money,
to stop calling too.

07:05.224 --> 07:08.560
Then why'd you bundle up your kid
and make her into an exile?

07:08.561 --> 07:09.494
In the Philippines, no less!

07:09.495 --> 07:10.462
An exchange student!

07:10.463 --> 07:14.468
Exchange students
with no cash are exiles!

07:14.734 --> 07:17.271
You make me want
to drink bacteria.

07:17.470 --> 07:18.608
Boksung!

07:19.338 --> 07:20.783
Did you send the
girls on delivery again?

07:22.108 --> 07:24.776
So unprofessional.
Customers are coming!

07:24.777 --> 07:28.914
That's why we should have kids!
Sons, daughters... how nice!

07:28.915 --> 07:31.623
They'll cook, do deliveries...
One big happy family, huh?

07:31.717 --> 07:34.493
You really want to raise
kids in this hellhole?

07:34.587 --> 07:36.430
With the redevelopment
on hold?

07:41.627 --> 07:43.265
God, what a temper!

07:43.429 --> 07:46.431
We should just leave
this neighborhood. What the hell?

07:46.432 --> 07:47.308
Oh!

07:47.400 --> 07:49.175
You think I applied here
to do deliveries?

07:49.268 --> 07:51.680
Sit down!
Next to me, I mean!

07:51.771 --> 07:54.911
It's Jangsu!
Come to see me?

07:55.041 --> 07:57.021
Did the old man give his consent?

07:58.110 --> 07:59.384
Now you're at it, too?

07:59.946 --> 08:02.380
- Go and work, dammit!
- All right, sorry!

08:02.381 --> 08:05.617
Always high quality, low prices!
We have a sale now!

08:05.618 --> 08:08.895
Today's items are fabulous!
Fill up your cart today!

08:10.690 --> 08:11.464
Mom.

08:11.557 --> 08:13.628
What?
Did you get everything?

08:13.726 --> 08:14.459
Let's go.

08:14.460 --> 08:15.734
Okay.

08:39.051 --> 08:41.258
Where's my damned key!

08:46.158 --> 08:49.127
So, he cooked rice
and then ran off?

08:49.128 --> 08:50.495
That's what I said!

08:50.496 --> 08:52.066
Sir, why are you doing this?

08:52.164 --> 08:53.802
I'm serious!

08:54.066 --> 08:56.945
- Somebody cooked...
- Are you bored?

08:57.036 --> 08:58.270
Is that why you're doing this?

08:58.271 --> 09:01.573
Listen, there is rice
in my rice cooker!

09:01.574 --> 09:03.611
<i>Goodbye, sir.</i>

09:04.443 --> 09:05.786
That damned ass!

09:06.012 --> 09:07.855
As I mentioned before,

09:07.947 --> 09:11.360
free English lessons
with native speakers!

09:11.651 --> 09:13.824
Our neighborhood sure will change!

09:15.721 --> 09:18.224
Wish this were
the dedication ceremony.

09:20.660 --> 09:25.370
Imagine the apartments there.
Sprouting up all over!

09:25.431 --> 09:28.300
At the residents center swimming pool,
with our Ja-young and her mom,

09:28.301 --> 09:30.474
tanning ourselves,
drenched in oil!

09:38.177 --> 09:40.011
You don't have the body for it,
you're out!

09:40.012 --> 09:41.813
Is the redevelopment
really happening?

09:41.814 --> 09:44.090
How many damned years
have we waited?

09:44.150 --> 09:45.517
Stop raining on our parade!

09:45.518 --> 09:47.520
- What rain?
- Just trust me!

09:49.522 --> 09:51.729
We have got the unfortunate news
that an extreme minority

09:51.824 --> 09:55.393
of one or two people are
objecting to the redevelopment.

09:55.394 --> 09:59.497
But if I can explain
it to them again,

09:59.498 --> 10:01.273
there's no doubt
in my mind

10:01.367 --> 10:03.535
we can secure their...!

10:03.536 --> 10:04.412
Approval?

10:05.871 --> 10:07.179
Turn it off-and-on!

10:08.140 --> 10:11.144
No, don't do that!
Mr. Kim!

10:13.479 --> 10:16.255
- Jangsu! Oh my god!
- Keep going! Mr. Kim!

10:16.349 --> 10:18.124
Mr. Kim!

10:21.120 --> 10:22.098
Open the door!

10:27.059 --> 10:29.437
They want to tear up
the neighborhood,

10:30.229 --> 10:32.800
and throw away
everything broken?

10:33.899 --> 10:36.311
With no thought for
old men like us.

10:36.869 --> 10:40.373
Who made it possible
for them to live this way?

10:40.873 --> 10:45.322
Shipping us off to fight in Vietnam
and earn dollars!

10:45.945 --> 10:46.946
Yummy.

10:48.214 --> 10:51.058
- Drink some milk, too!
- Okay.

11:02.728 --> 11:03.672
Look at you!

11:04.997 --> 11:07.705
Wish I had
so much to smile about.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.605
Did you contact your family?

11:13.105 --> 11:15.483
Heard you met them
on the street?

11:21.113 --> 11:26.028
The marines can even catch ghosts,

11:26.886 --> 11:29.154
Our brave marines...

11:29.155 --> 11:31.829
Put some life into it!
This is a marching song!

11:31.957 --> 11:39.432
The blood-boiling passion of youth,
who can stop it?

11:55.414 --> 11:58.049
<i>Losecl the last Tuesday
of each month - Jangsu Mart</i>

11:58.050 --> 12:02.726
He forgets his day off,
but never forgets his seal.

12:06.025 --> 12:07.026
Mr. Kim!

12:10.763 --> 12:13.004
We're going to play soccer,
want to come?

12:14.233 --> 12:16.839
If you're playing,
why should I come?

12:21.974 --> 12:24.352
Okay, okay!
Pass!

12:30.816 --> 12:32.193
Short pass to Boksung, there!

12:55.307 --> 12:58.516
You whiffed it!

13:02.381 --> 13:03.325
Throw me the ball.

13:03.415 --> 13:06.217
Mr. Kim, could we have the ball?
Throw it in.

13:06.218 --> 13:07.219
Go on!

13:08.888 --> 13:10.834
Huh, what are you doing, Mr. Kim?

13:27.439 --> 13:29.476
- Did you see that?
- Mr. Kim, that's amazing!

13:34.413 --> 13:36.757
- Did you see that kick?
- Enjoy!

13:37.316 --> 13:41.822
Everyone, today's meal fee is $10!
Cheap, right?

13:41.921 --> 13:43.888
Can't you just treat us?

13:43.889 --> 13:46.291
Besides, you lost
the damned game!

13:46.292 --> 13:47.058
- All right.
- No kidding!

13:47.059 --> 13:48.927
Should've cheered for District 2.

13:48.928 --> 13:49.627
Thank you!

13:49.628 --> 13:52.330
Credit me
for mending your wife's skirt.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.832
- What?
- You didn't pay for her skirt.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.167
Paying for this meal
would sure leave a bad taste.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.148
Too bad you're
so badly exposed.

13:59.605 --> 14:01.607
Next time, the stew restaurant...

14:01.707 --> 14:02.941
You all did your best.

14:02.942 --> 14:04.943
But you know,
the essence of soccer is

14:04.944 --> 14:07.412
teamwork, skill, reaction time.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.359
You're the first person I've met
who lacks all three.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.516
Next time let's leave you out,

14:11.517 --> 14:13.190
and have Mr KIM take your place.

14:13.252 --> 14:15.520
No, we have our pride!

14:15.521 --> 14:17.432
We lose at soccer, and the
redevelopment's postponed.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.325
Jangsu, don't be such a pacifist.

14:20.326 --> 14:21.896
Got any bright ideas?

14:21.961 --> 14:23.328
Hey Boksung!

14:23.329 --> 14:26.640
Like he said, let's drop you
and bring in the old man.

14:27.766 --> 14:29.100
When mendo sports together,

14:29.101 --> 14:31.169
sharing those moments,
guy to guy...

14:31.170 --> 14:32.843
Friendship!
You get friendship.

14:32.972 --> 14:33.950
Damn you!

14:34.039 --> 14:35.607
- Listen up!
- Let's drop him.

14:35.608 --> 14:36.674
- Sit down, honey.
- Huh?

14:36.675 --> 14:39.477
Why are you all so naive?

14:39.478 --> 14:43.517
Young men, old men,
what do they all like?

14:43.616 --> 14:44.788
Card games?

14:44.850 --> 14:46.693
We just want redevelopment.

14:48.087 --> 14:49.031
What's this?

14:49.788 --> 14:51.961
Hot women.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.435
"Follow me, boys!"

14:55.794 --> 14:58.035
"Bring your seal!"

15:01.700 --> 15:02.872
Oh my gosh!

15:05.170 --> 15:05.807
Who are you?

15:05.938 --> 15:09.040
- This isn't what you think.
- Thief!

15:09.041 --> 15:11.715
Don't move, thief! Freeze!

15:14.813 --> 15:16.383
What did I tell you?

15:16.515 --> 15:20.485
Someone's been breaking in
to my home, and making rice!

15:20.486 --> 15:22.453
I can't believe this old man.

15:22.454 --> 15:24.689
What kind of generous thief
would cook rice for you?

15:24.690 --> 15:26.758
I wish that thief
would break into my home!

15:26.759 --> 15:28.226
How can you say that!

15:28.227 --> 15:30.695
- I wanted to give you rice cakes.
- Rice cakes?

15:30.696 --> 15:32.198
Rice cakes, my ass!

15:32.898 --> 15:34.933
She wanted... to steal from me!

15:34.934 --> 15:36.634
No, I didn't.

15:36.635 --> 15:38.774
Let go of me!

15:39.371 --> 15:40.349
Mom!

15:44.510 --> 15:46.421
Have some tea
to soothe your nerves.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.850
Tea?

15:54.386 --> 15:55.831
Wait a minute!

15:57.656 --> 16:00.796
Go on inside.
I want to talk to him.

16:03.896 --> 16:06.001
Tell me you're sorry,
to wrap this up.

16:06.098 --> 16:08.733
Who told you to just
walk into an empty house?

16:08.734 --> 16:10.577
I was worried about you.

16:11.070 --> 16:14.244
The door was open,
and no one answered me.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.074
It's because you live alone.

16:16.075 --> 16:19.454
I went inside,
just in case something happened.

16:19.545 --> 16:20.683
You satisfied?

16:21.580 --> 16:22.854
What's your name?

16:25.184 --> 16:26.686
I'm KIM Sungchil.

16:26.885 --> 16:28.626
'Sung' meaning star,
'chil' meaning seven.

16:30.122 --> 16:31.362
My name...

16:32.324 --> 16:33.894
My name is...

16:35.794 --> 16:37.603
Geum-nim.

16:38.430 --> 16:40.376
Family name 'lM.'

16:40.666 --> 16:42.304
IM Geum-nim.

16:43.569 --> 16:47.540
Your parents picked a fine name.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.820
That's a noble name.

16:49.908 --> 16:51.387
KIM Sungchil!

16:53.012 --> 16:57.119
I still didn't get your apology.
Buy me dinner, okay?

17:05.523 --> 17:07.731
<i>IM Geum-nim,
the old lady next door.</i>

17:10.329 --> 17:12.366
<i>IM Geum-nim, next door.</i>

17:19.003 --> 17:20.243
Damn thing!

17:21.406 --> 17:23.647
Mr. Kim, are you home?

17:24.810 --> 17:26.016
Mr. Kim?

17:28.480 --> 17:30.426
Who's making this racket?!

17:31.817 --> 17:34.185
Hello, Mr. Kim.
I'm from the district office!

17:34.186 --> 17:36.097
- What do you want? What?
- Oh my!

17:39.558 --> 17:44.166
We're visiting the homes of
residents who are 65 and over.

17:44.396 --> 17:48.933
Our district head is particularly
interested in social welfare.

17:48.934 --> 17:51.676
So you came to check
if I'm dead or alive?

17:51.970 --> 17:54.814
You know the veteran Choi
who lives near here?

17:54.907 --> 17:56.386
That old loony? Why?

17:56.542 --> 17:58.522
- Last night...
- Yeah?

17:59.445 --> 18:00.711
Last night, he...

18:00.712 --> 18:01.979
Goddammit!

18:01.980 --> 18:04.654
What, did he have an affair?

18:04.750 --> 18:06.696
I'm too busy for this!

18:21.934 --> 18:30.718
<i>The marines can even catch ghosts,
Our brave marines...</i>

18:31.710 --> 18:35.817
<i>The blood-boiling passion of youth,</i>

18:36.081 --> 18:39.255
<i>who can stop it?</i>

18:49.628 --> 18:57.410
The blood-boiling passion of youth,
Men of the sea...

19:02.241 --> 19:05.779
<i>My name is KIM Sungchil.</i>

19:19.858 --> 19:21.769
What the hell am I doing?

19:21.960 --> 19:23.371
- Hi there!
- Oh my god!

19:23.462 --> 19:25.229
Something interesting
over there?

19:25.230 --> 19:26.364
No, nothing.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.242
Something going on
with that flower seller?

19:28.333 --> 19:29.835
No, nothing!

19:29.902 --> 19:31.347
Just curious.

19:31.436 --> 19:33.040
Forget it!
On your way.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.241
It's illegal to post
these damned flyers!

19:37.242 --> 19:38.380
Those are our flyers...

19:40.679 --> 19:41.953
He seems worked up.

19:42.581 --> 19:43.924
KIM Sungchil!

19:45.617 --> 19:46.857
Good morning!

19:48.854 --> 19:49.958
Ah, yes.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.627
You're on your way to work?

19:53.525 --> 19:54.526
Yes.

19:54.626 --> 19:56.299
Have a nice day.

19:56.461 --> 19:57.496
Okay, yes.

19:58.163 --> 19:59.263
Good morning!

19:59.264 --> 20:04.873
Exchanged glances...
what could they mean?

20:15.480 --> 20:17.255
Who is...?

20:19.117 --> 20:20.460
Yeah?

20:20.819 --> 20:22.924
<i>Were you sleeping?</i>

20:23.855 --> 20:26.131
It's me, IM Geum-nim!

20:26.391 --> 20:28.928
You haven't forgotten
about buying me dinner?

20:29.561 --> 20:31.006
<i>Don't forget.</i>

20:31.230 --> 20:32.538
Goodnight!

20:42.608 --> 20:45.145
He's open.
Center it! Center!

20:48.046 --> 20:49.247
Now, the defender!

20:49.248 --> 20:51.319
Hey, out of the way!

20:51.550 --> 20:52.324
What are you doing?

20:52.451 --> 20:53.828
Hey, you little brat!

20:53.919 --> 20:56.092
Move over!
Why are you being such a pain?

20:56.188 --> 20:58.322
Jangsu, when are we
going out to eat tripe?

20:58.323 --> 20:59.857
Hey, it's almost over.
As soon as the game's done.

20:59.858 --> 21:03.294
- Now, can you move?
- Okay, I'll move.

21:03.295 --> 21:05.070
- What?
- My Jangsu!

21:07.266 --> 21:10.577
It's just the two of us here,
are you so interested in soccer?

21:10.736 --> 21:12.306
Hmm?

21:13.272 --> 21:15.106
He stole it!
You go in yourself!

21:15.107 --> 21:16.780
Shoot it!

21:16.875 --> 21:18.809
You shoot it!
Go, go!

21:18.810 --> 21:19.845
Shoot!

21:20.279 --> 21:22.589
Oh, he missed.

21:22.681 --> 21:26.527
Jangsu, how could you!
You're stepping on my pride!

21:28.620 --> 21:30.497
Mr. Kim, what brings you here?

21:30.722 --> 21:31.889
Hey, go out for a sec.

21:31.890 --> 21:32.994
Why?

21:35.027 --> 21:37.769
You seem to have been in a hurry.

21:37.929 --> 21:38.839
Huh?

21:39.598 --> 21:43.239
But, an apology?
That doesn't seem your style.

21:43.568 --> 21:46.370
- Could it be that your feelings for her...?
- I'm leaving.

21:46.371 --> 21:48.578
Okay, okay!

21:48.674 --> 21:51.120
You came to ask for help, right?

21:51.209 --> 21:52.449
- Yeah.
- Yes!

21:56.315 --> 22:00.284
I'm a war veteran.
If you spread rumors... you know?

22:00.285 --> 22:01.662
Yes, I understand!

22:04.156 --> 22:06.227
How would you like your meat?

22:06.525 --> 22:07.663
Ah, cook it.

22:07.759 --> 22:10.761
We certainly will.
But say, "Medium, please."

22:10.762 --> 22:13.197
- Medium, please.
- Yes, that's good.

22:13.198 --> 22:14.233
Medium...

22:14.700 --> 22:15.770
Right.

22:15.934 --> 22:17.335
Now, dinner is over.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.280
Let's go.

22:18.403 --> 22:20.314
Not yet! Not yet.

22:20.439 --> 22:21.440
Dessert!

22:21.573 --> 22:23.917
You must have dessert.

22:24.743 --> 22:25.343
- Dessert...
- Yes, dessert.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.010
<i>When ordering: 1) Medium 2) Dessert
- Dessert... - Yes, dessert.</i>

22:26.011 --> 22:26.744
<i>When ordering:
1) Medium 2) Dessert</i>

22:26.745 --> 22:27.689
Waiter!

22:28.280 --> 22:29.315
Call the waiter.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.855
- Waiter!
- A bit softer.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.617
- Waiter!
- Waiter!

22:33.618 --> 22:35.820
- Okay... waiter.
- Waiter!

22:35.821 --> 22:37.528
- Check, please.
- Yes, sir.

22:37.889 --> 22:39.596
That's right, speak gently.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.638
Now he asks,
“How would you like to pay?“

22:43.161 --> 22:44.435
Huh?

22:44.696 --> 22:45.606
How much?

22:45.831 --> 22:47.333
Don't pay cash.

22:47.833 --> 22:49.967
On a date, use this card.

22:49.968 --> 22:52.005
Aren't I the best boss ever?
Here.

22:52.671 --> 22:54.138
So, the waiter goes.

22:54.139 --> 22:57.174
If they ask,
"Do you have a discount coupon?"

22:57.175 --> 22:58.119
Look at me.

22:59.945 --> 23:01.679
I don't need those.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.182
Do you have a discount coupon?

23:03.582 --> 23:05.493
That's right.

23:05.851 --> 23:09.253
Women won't respect men
who use coupons on a first date.

23:09.254 --> 23:10.287
It's not a date!

23:10.288 --> 23:12.393
- Stop saying that.
- Yes, anyway.

23:12.624 --> 23:13.796
Thank you!

23:14.126 --> 23:15.161
So the check has arrived.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.571
You sign for it right here.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.742
And when you do,
straighten your back!

23:20.832 --> 23:23.000
Firmly, quickly, precisely,
like a man!

23:23.001 --> 23:24.368
In one stroke, yes!

23:24.369 --> 23:25.109
Like that!

23:25.170 --> 23:29.016
You'd be surprised at
the effect that has on women.

23:33.178 --> 23:35.089
You've got great handwriting.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.557
That's why I insisted on
a signature, not a seal.

23:40.552 --> 23:41.622
Here you are.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.157
Wow, who made this suit?!

23:44.289 --> 23:46.132
Who made such a beautiful suit?

23:46.892 --> 23:49.065
Design by KIM Chi-soo, remember.

23:49.361 --> 23:51.238
Turn around.

23:51.830 --> 23:55.300
Open up your arms
slightly so you don't sweat.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.936
No, just a little.

23:58.003 --> 24:02.247
Sir, I think a short explanation
is needed for this work.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.946
It's a blend of French nostalgia,

24:05.076 --> 24:07.845
Italian sensibility,
and New York humor.

24:07.846 --> 24:08.722
It was crafted...

24:09.514 --> 24:11.582
with those elements in mind.

24:11.583 --> 24:13.426
An illegal copy. A fake!

24:15.454 --> 24:18.856
I had it made last year
for my father's birthday gift.

24:18.857 --> 24:20.791
You're the same size,
so it fits you perfectly.

24:20.792 --> 24:23.932
He never paid,
so I kept it on layaway.

24:24.095 --> 24:25.930
As a special favor to you...

24:25.931 --> 24:28.502
wishing you a successful date...

24:29.634 --> 24:32.336
- It's his friend's son's wedding!
- Right, right.

24:32.337 --> 24:35.284
I told him that.
What's his problem?

24:35.373 --> 24:39.412
Okay, the finishing touch
of fashion is, shoes!

24:39.611 --> 24:41.318
With some good shoes,

24:41.613 --> 24:45.322
all the old women that day
will be head over heels...

24:45.484 --> 24:48.795
no, for your clothes!

24:48.887 --> 24:51.355
All the women at the wedding!

24:51.356 --> 24:52.596
At the wedding.

24:52.691 --> 24:55.092
Anyway, all we need now
is shoes, right?

24:55.093 --> 24:57.266
I'll take care of that.

24:57.963 --> 25:00.698
I hardly ever wear dress shoes,
so they're like new.

25:00.699 --> 25:01.866
I have shoes, too!

25:01.867 --> 25:03.437
Oh, you're home?

25:03.835 --> 25:05.903
- Hello.
- Hello.

25:05.904 --> 25:07.315
Hey, why are you home
at this time?

25:07.439 --> 25:09.942
Midterm exams!
You didn't even know?

25:10.575 --> 25:12.710
Do I have to know everything?
What's with your temper?

25:12.711 --> 25:13.911
If I ask,

25:13.912 --> 25:15.687
'How was your test?'
you'll say, 'The paper looked nice.'

25:15.847 --> 25:16.647
Oh god.

25:16.648 --> 25:17.558
What were you doing here?

25:17.883 --> 25:18.725
The computer!

25:21.486 --> 25:22.464
What?

25:24.322 --> 25:25.300
Polar bears?

25:25.357 --> 25:27.359
Don't you even care
about the polar bears?

25:27.459 --> 25:30.694
They're starving from global warming.
You don't even donate.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.402
My heart is breaking for them.

25:32.831 --> 25:34.632
If you're gonna hang out,
do it in here.

25:34.633 --> 25:35.966
Don't go lock yourselves
in your room.

25:35.967 --> 25:36.809
Yes, sir.

25:36.902 --> 25:39.348
What the hell
are you talking about?

25:39.504 --> 25:41.074
Looks like I got these just in time.

25:41.339 --> 25:42.613
- Go on in.
- Okay...

25:46.177 --> 25:48.020
What's his damn problem?!

25:54.586 --> 25:55.929
What are you doing?

25:56.354 --> 25:57.594
Don't do that!

25:58.590 --> 25:59.466
<i>All right.</i>

26:00.725 --> 26:03.672
<i>First, when you meet her,
tell her she's pretty.</i>

26:03.795 --> 26:05.240
<i>Women love to hear that.</i>

26:05.564 --> 26:08.499
Her eyes, her nose...
or even her shoes.

26:08.500 --> 26:11.606
Why do I have to say that?
I'm buying dinner.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.170
Good bye!

26:13.171 --> 26:14.115
Bye!

26:24.516 --> 26:26.150
<i>Last time
I said I'd buy dinner.</i>

26:26.151 --> 26:28.358
<i>If you still want to, see you at 7.
Neighbor KIM Sungchil.</i>

26:28.520 --> 26:30.727
I got a memo saying
let's eat dinner.

26:33.959 --> 26:36.337
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.945
Sorry, I'm late, aren't I?

26:52.010 --> 26:53.580
14 minutes.

26:53.678 --> 26:55.123
Oh, sorry...

26:55.380 --> 26:57.951
I thought you were
asking me how late.

26:58.049 --> 26:59.221
Ah...

27:07.292 --> 27:08.202
Let's go.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.237
Okay.

27:16.501 --> 27:17.639
Very pretty-

27:18.103 --> 27:19.013
Really?

27:20.005 --> 27:21.143
Your shoes.

27:22.173 --> 27:23.880
Ah...

27:24.743 --> 27:27.952
I reserved a table
at a good restaurant.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.724
Okay...

27:34.619 --> 27:35.859
Did you choose?

27:36.454 --> 27:37.592
Yes.

27:38.657 --> 27:39.727
Ah, waiter!

27:41.860 --> 27:45.103
Waiter...

27:50.035 --> 27:51.201
Can I take your order?

27:51.202 --> 27:54.104
I can't see
without my glasses.

27:54.105 --> 27:57.041
Just give me the
Fish of the Day.

27:57.042 --> 27:57.741
Yes, ma'am.

27:57.742 --> 27:58.742
And you?

27:58.743 --> 28:01.121
I'll have medium!

28:01.179 --> 28:02.180
Excuse me?

28:03.982 --> 28:07.395
Ah, one fish, and one steak?

28:07.485 --> 28:08.486
Yes.

28:13.892 --> 28:16.460
We ordered wine,
but didn't toast.

28:16.461 --> 28:17.462
Ah!

28:19.731 --> 28:20.607
Oh!

28:33.645 --> 28:35.090
You must have been thirsty.

28:35.180 --> 28:36.488
Yes.

28:37.015 --> 28:39.518
Have you lived in this
neighborhood long?

28:39.951 --> 28:41.157
Well...

28:42.787 --> 28:43.954
pretty long.

28:43.955 --> 28:45.434
And before that?

28:45.757 --> 28:47.566
You from the census bureau?

28:47.692 --> 28:49.467
It's like an arranged date.

28:50.528 --> 28:52.235
Have you ever had
an arranged date?

28:52.330 --> 28:55.311
Why would I do that?
Go through all that fuss.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.643
It's all just baggage.

28:58.036 --> 28:59.140
Isn't it?

29:00.405 --> 29:02.146
Ah, dessert?

29:02.240 --> 29:05.016
No, I'm full.
I'm fine.

29:08.780 --> 29:11.386
Do you happen to have
a discount coupon?

29:12.117 --> 29:13.721
Huh?

29:25.697 --> 29:26.698
Thank you.

29:32.070 --> 29:35.779
I really enjoyed today.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.147
My debt's paid, anyway.

29:38.476 --> 29:39.454
Yes.

29:40.011 --> 29:43.083
Wait! Can I call you?

29:43.481 --> 29:44.926
I'm not home very much.

29:45.016 --> 29:47.018
I'll call when you're home, then.

30:10.208 --> 30:12.950
Oh, I'm fine.
How are you, Mom?

30:13.144 --> 30:16.853
Yes, okay then.
Bye...

30:17.715 --> 30:19.817
A drink tonight? Sure!

30:19.818 --> 30:22.419
Honey, I came to the supermarket.

30:22.420 --> 30:24.457
What are we going to eat
for dinner?

30:25.223 --> 30:26.600
You've got one, too?

30:27.258 --> 30:31.035
How can someone at a bank
tell me to use a loan shark?

30:31.629 --> 30:33.734
Are you kidding me?! Hello?

30:34.399 --> 30:36.879
You hung up on me?

30:37.101 --> 30:38.045
Oh, you scared me!

30:38.136 --> 30:39.206
What is it?

30:40.038 --> 30:41.039
This.

30:41.706 --> 30:42.912
Hello?

30:43.241 --> 30:44.508
Thank you, goodbye!

30:44.509 --> 30:48.685
- Hello?
- Mr. Kim, touch here to answer.

30:50.181 --> 30:52.252
Hello, hello?

30:52.517 --> 30:54.019
Ah, hello?

30:54.118 --> 30:56.155
Yes, congratulations
on your new phone.

30:57.088 --> 31:00.757
As for me, I think the
smart era has truly arrived.

31:00.758 --> 31:03.864
To win a woman's heart,
you must embrace the present era.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.495
What woman's heart?

31:05.496 --> 31:09.273
Use this chance to stop by
and give her your number.

31:10.134 --> 31:11.807
What do you take me for?

31:12.136 --> 31:14.275
Come on, go ahead!

31:14.372 --> 31:17.285
Exchanged glances...

31:18.376 --> 31:21.357
This tea is
good for your health,

31:22.013 --> 31:24.084
and reduces fatigue.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.295
Smells nice, right?

31:29.454 --> 31:31.195
Oh, did you catch a cold?

31:31.890 --> 31:33.164
Do I have a call?

31:36.861 --> 31:39.034
Hello... hello?

31:40.398 --> 31:42.469
It's a wrong number.

31:42.834 --> 31:44.939
You bought a new phone?

31:45.436 --> 31:50.351
Wow, it has a big screen,
so I don't need glasses to read it.

31:50.441 --> 31:53.513
I thought you don't use cellphones?

31:53.845 --> 31:55.212
Oh, well...

31:55.213 --> 31:56.624
Why'd you buy one?

31:57.181 --> 31:58.285
Hm?

31:58.549 --> 32:00.028
Answer me!

32:00.285 --> 32:07.464
Oh... I think,
the smart era has arrived.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.361
So now I can call you
on this phone.

32:11.362 --> 32:12.262
What's your number?

32:12.263 --> 32:13.298
Ah, yes...

32:26.411 --> 32:27.947
He's a quick learner.

32:29.547 --> 32:30.423
Duck!

32:32.250 --> 32:34.025
You rotten scoundrels!

32:37.088 --> 32:38.795
Hello, sir.

32:47.131 --> 32:49.475
<i>Have a good clay today.
- KIM Sungchil.</i>

32:52.837 --> 32:55.317
- So it didn't end with dinner?
- Are you jealous?

32:58.977 --> 33:01.651
<i>Oh a tect message!
Have a goof day Sungchal!</i>

33:01.746 --> 33:03.384
Use your glasses.

33:03.481 --> 33:04.848
Makes me look like
a grandmother.

33:04.849 --> 33:06.283
- "Watch out..."
- Watch out?

33:06.284 --> 33:09.561
No... "Don't catch a cold."

33:09.654 --> 33:11.759
Don't catch...

33:13.157 --> 33:14.932
<i>Don't catch a cold</i>

33:17.795 --> 33:18.562
You too, dress wermtday
Cheese!

33:18.563 --> 33:19.429
<i>You too, dress wermtclay</i>

33:19.430 --> 33:21.467
You too, dress wermtday
Cheese!

33:31.576 --> 33:33.351
Get a grip, Mom.

33:33.878 --> 33:35.084
<i>M-geum!</i>

33:35.213 --> 33:37.716
Oops... IM Geum-nim!

33:38.016 --> 33:40.121
- Yes, that's me.
- Yes.

33:42.553 --> 33:44.521
You should address me fully.

33:44.522 --> 33:47.025
What? Oh my!

33:47.425 --> 33:50.269
IM Geum-nim-nim
(Ms. IM Geum-nim)

33:50.361 --> 33:51.795
You're new here?

33:51.796 --> 33:55.073
Yes... I really like your name.

33:57.468 --> 33:59.709
<i>Dayoungfs Dad</i>

34:02.040 --> 34:04.247
You called me out
to tell me that?

34:04.509 --> 34:07.820
Well... I thought I should
tell you in person.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.351
It's common courtesy.

34:09.580 --> 34:10.524
Courtesy?

34:10.915 --> 34:12.360
Let's not bicker, okay?

34:12.750 --> 34:14.752
We decided not to have children.

34:15.853 --> 34:17.525
Why are you telling me that?

34:17.755 --> 34:18.995
Common courtesy?

34:20.123 --> 34:23.036
Forget it.
Have a good life.

34:23.393 --> 34:24.873
Okay, thanks.

34:26.831 --> 34:28.400
Don't worry about
Dayoung's expenses.

34:29.167 --> 34:30.543
Of course.

34:35.440 --> 34:39.009
That's right, be a man!
Keep going straight in...!

34:39.010 --> 34:40.080
Damn...

34:40.178 --> 34:42.478
Mom, I'm going
to pick up Dayoung.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.619
Why'd he suddenly
go to the food stand?

34:45.183 --> 34:46.184
Come in!

34:47.385 --> 34:49.728
Oh, I get it.
Part of his strategy.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.391
He's staying close to the target.

34:51.822 --> 34:53.824
- Oh, the second attempt.
- Second attempt?

34:54.958 --> 34:59.465
His desire pulls him in
like a moth to the flame...!

34:59.564 --> 35:00.440
Dammit!

35:00.531 --> 35:03.034
Shouldn't they be
sleeping together by now?

35:03.134 --> 35:04.841
Why do they
go home separately?

35:04.936 --> 35:06.643
Why doesn't she
answer her phone?

35:07.572 --> 35:09.574
Why are they so loud
over there?

35:11.476 --> 35:13.513
Drinking, every day.

35:13.578 --> 35:15.278
They drank up everything
in our restaurant.

35:15.279 --> 35:16.379
There's nothing to sell anymore.

35:16.380 --> 35:18.482
Hey, not having stock
would be great!

35:18.483 --> 35:20.917
My dry cleaning place
has got clothes up to my neck,

35:20.918 --> 35:23.592
I'm practically
buried in them!

35:26.991 --> 35:29.793
Hey polar bear, pick up
when your Dad calls!

35:29.794 --> 35:30.898
You're done with exams, right?

35:30.995 --> 35:31.996
Listen.

35:32.163 --> 35:36.305
How about taking a stroll
with Minsung tomorrow?

35:41.305 --> 35:42.648
<i>When you're walking together,</i>

35:42.740 --> 35:44.474
<i>don't go ahead or behind her.</i>

35:44.475 --> 35:46.284
<i>Be sure to walk side by side.</i>

35:51.682 --> 35:54.959
<i>Before eating, when you ask
"What would you like to eat?"</i>

35:55.253 --> 35:57.995
<i>"I like Korean food,
or anything."</i>

35:58.189 --> 36:00.931
<i>That means
she wants Korean food.</i>

36:01.125 --> 36:03.264
Let's have Korean food then.

36:03.361 --> 36:04.237
Okay...

36:07.098 --> 36:09.166
<i>When you're shopping,
if she asks, "How does this look?"</i>

36:09.167 --> 36:10.100
<i>She wants you to buy it for her.</i>

36:10.101 --> 36:11.910
How does this look?

36:12.003 --> 36:13.744
<i>Don't be stingy, snatch it up.</i>

36:17.608 --> 36:19.451
Yes, that's $20.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.950
<i>Women like men
who have good taste.</i>

36:23.047 --> 36:25.220
<i>I'll download some
popular music apps for you.</i>

36:25.316 --> 36:27.296
<i>Listen together
on your earphones.</i>

36:30.521 --> 36:33.798
<i>Continuous stimulation will
promote adrenaline release,</i>

36:33.891 --> 36:36.167
<i>causing your feelings
for each other to deepen.</i>

36:37.895 --> 36:40.171
Oh, that's hot!

36:40.464 --> 36:41.340
Mr. Kim!

36:42.133 --> 36:44.238
<i>Have you heard
of a "bucket list?"</i>

36:44.535 --> 36:47.607
<i>You do things the
other person wants, one by one.</i>

36:47.972 --> 36:50.782
<i>Resolutely.
She'll definitely fall for you.</i>

36:55.112 --> 36:56.112
I feel nauseous.

36:56.113 --> 36:57.148
Oh no...!

37:05.356 --> 37:06.664
Sungchil!

37:09.527 --> 37:10.699
On your way to work?

37:10.828 --> 37:11.772
Yes.

37:12.663 --> 37:14.870
Want to play hooky with me?

37:19.971 --> 37:22.713
Why are you making me do this?

37:23.040 --> 37:25.953
It's my first time, too.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.887
I wanted to ride it, just once.

37:34.452 --> 37:35.954
Look, I told you.

37:37.355 --> 37:39.528
- Restroom... restroom.
- Huh?

38:00.177 --> 38:02.157
Did she die in there?

38:02.380 --> 38:03.688
Are you there?

38:03.781 --> 38:04.725
Yes.

38:05.683 --> 38:07.390
I'm right here.

38:07.852 --> 38:09.763
Don't move, stay right there.

38:09.854 --> 38:11.265
I won't go anywhere.

38:11.656 --> 38:12.930
I'll be right here.

38:26.103 --> 38:28.140
Sungchil...

38:28.806 --> 38:30.808
Would you sing a song for me?

38:32.543 --> 38:34.386
Huh? A song?

38:34.912 --> 38:37.518
I just...
feel scared in here.

38:37.648 --> 38:40.754
If you're scared,
then come out.

38:41.118 --> 38:44.497
I'm not finished yet.

38:45.222 --> 38:47.532
Okay?
Hurry. any song

38:47.625 --> 38:49.263
Oh, I... I can't.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.465
I won't do that.

38:51.529 --> 38:52.701
Never mind.

38:54.532 --> 38:55.738
Don't bother.

38:56.767 --> 38:58.474
Why does she...?

38:59.637 --> 39:01.310
Damn...

39:08.512 --> 39:13.985
All by myself.

39:14.485 --> 39:21.095
I want to know you.

39:21.959 --> 39:29.002
All by myself.

39:29.867 --> 39:36.716
I want to have you.

39:50.121 --> 39:53.330
What if something really
serious had happened?

39:54.658 --> 39:55.864
Mom.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.805
What worries me the most...

39:57.862 --> 40:00.843
I know,
you don't have to say it.

40:02.133 --> 40:03.510
But.

40:04.502 --> 40:09.247
At our age, everything
might be the last time.

40:11.075 --> 40:13.419
Sure enough,
we all need a partner in life.

40:13.511 --> 40:16.390
If the two of you
decide to live together,

40:16.781 --> 40:18.515
nothing beats an apartment.

40:18.516 --> 40:22.328
Old houses are so much work,
as you grow old, it's too hard.

40:22.720 --> 40:26.133
If only the redevelopment happens,
apartments will spring up here...

40:27.892 --> 40:29.132
Forget it.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.434
Yes, sir.

40:34.965 --> 40:38.105
I just opened this,
why are there so few?

40:39.170 --> 40:42.674
So... where is
the girl's mother?

40:45.309 --> 40:47.516
We went to the hospital,
but they said it was too late.

40:47.978 --> 40:51.255
I had quit, but after losing her
I started smoking again.

40:51.348 --> 40:52.554
You saw my daughter?

40:52.783 --> 40:54.956
She looks exactly
like her mother.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.127
But with a sick person at home,

40:58.389 --> 40:59.834
I couldn't give
her much attention.

41:01.158 --> 41:02.592
Sometimes I'm shocked.

41:02.593 --> 41:05.767
I come home and there's no kid,
just a young woman!

41:07.932 --> 41:10.400
At first I had
some bad thoughts.

41:10.401 --> 41:12.403
You know, calling it quits with life.

41:12.870 --> 41:15.680
But my father always used to say,

41:16.707 --> 41:19.347
children are like
a heavy stone

41:20.144 --> 41:23.990
that sits in a
part of your chest.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.622
Now I think I know
what he meant.

41:29.386 --> 41:30.763
Guess I'm all grown up.

41:32.056 --> 41:33.000
Another shot?

41:34.124 --> 41:39.403
Doraji... in the deep mountain...

41:39.497 --> 41:40.737
Good evening.

41:45.369 --> 41:46.439
Hi.

41:47.905 --> 41:49.145
Please...

41:50.975 --> 41:53.751
don't see
my mother any more.

41:54.011 --> 41:55.684
Don't ask the reason.

41:56.313 --> 41:57.883
Just please
accept my request.

42:16.500 --> 42:20.710
But who is she to tell us
to meet or not?

42:26.610 --> 42:28.487
I enjoyed my stay.

42:28.746 --> 42:31.488
I wish you could
stay a day longer.

42:31.882 --> 42:33.418
It's tough for you, isn't it?

42:33.517 --> 42:34.962
No, I'm fine.

42:35.286 --> 42:37.027
Take care of yourself.

42:37.354 --> 42:39.129
You'll come to the reception?

42:39.223 --> 42:41.225
Yes, of course.

42:41.325 --> 42:43.703
- Have a good trip back.
- Thanks.

43:02.179 --> 43:03.351
Hello, sir.

43:16.527 --> 43:20.168
Hi there! Mr. Kim,
do you have a date today?

43:20.364 --> 43:21.809
What damned date?

43:21.899 --> 43:23.276
What's your name, anyway?

43:23.367 --> 43:24.141
What?

43:24.234 --> 43:25.969
JEGAL... JEGAL Chung-su.

43:25.970 --> 43:28.917
Jagalchi fish?
Hey, get out of my way!

43:30.107 --> 43:30.940
Do I smell like fish?

43:30.941 --> 43:33.581
I'm begging you,
just tell him directly!

43:33.677 --> 43:35.247
There's no time!

43:35.346 --> 43:38.384
I'll get his seal.
Wait just a bit longer.

43:38.449 --> 43:40.827
The bank's going to
take my supermarket!

43:41.051 --> 43:44.055
Oh, I've got to go.
I'll call later.

43:44.855 --> 43:46.095
Sungchil!

43:48.258 --> 43:51.865
If you're not busy,
want to go out for dinner?

43:52.196 --> 43:52.970
No way.

43:53.530 --> 43:56.977
This time I'll treat you.
Korean food.

43:57.534 --> 44:00.879
There's a place I went
that's really nice.

44:01.305 --> 44:04.374
Only two bus stops from here,
shall we walk?

44:04.375 --> 44:06.252
Get some exercise?

44:08.746 --> 44:10.919
Come with me, okay?

44:11.348 --> 44:12.691
Let's walk separately.

44:17.788 --> 44:21.065
That's strange,
it should be here.

44:25.462 --> 44:26.964
Did they move?

44:30.034 --> 44:34.574
I'm sorry, I should have
checked before coming.

44:35.439 --> 44:38.977
Wait, let me
call my daughter.

44:39.243 --> 44:40.517
No, let's...

44:41.178 --> 44:42.919
Let's just pick any place.

44:45.149 --> 44:48.130
Are they growing
the bean sprouts?

44:48.318 --> 44:50.355
What's taking so long?

45:03.033 --> 45:05.201
Why's it so hot?

45:05.202 --> 45:08.104
Grandpa, it's a hot bowl,
of course it's hot!

45:08.105 --> 45:09.015
Look here!

45:09.073 --> 45:10.984
Am I your grandpa?

45:11.308 --> 45:12.742
And why don't
you give me salt?

45:12.743 --> 45:14.347
The salt's right there!

45:27.624 --> 45:29.459
Good evening.
Two, please.

45:29.460 --> 45:30.404
Yes...

45:35.299 --> 45:39.145
If someone greets you,
shouldn't you answer?

45:39.470 --> 45:41.237
Why did you ignore her?

45:41.238 --> 45:44.340
I nodded my head at her.

45:44.341 --> 45:46.209
Yes, he greeted me.

45:46.210 --> 45:49.419
No wait,
he definitely didn't greet her.

45:49.580 --> 45:52.618
This jerk is claiming he did,
when he didn't!

45:52.750 --> 45:54.317
Shall we play back the CCTV?

45:54.318 --> 45:55.524
Are you mocking me?!

45:55.619 --> 45:56.927
It's fine.

45:57.054 --> 46:00.757
He did greet me, and
he's apologizing too.

46:00.758 --> 46:03.238
Right?
So go take a seat.

46:04.595 --> 46:07.542
Young punk, wearing
sunglasses at night.

46:11.769 --> 46:13.407
I'm 70 years old!

46:13.771 --> 46:16.149
My hair has been dyed black.

46:16.340 --> 46:19.344
I can't drive if I'm
insulted like this.

46:19.443 --> 46:20.649
I won't!

46:20.778 --> 46:21.984
We're not moving?

46:22.112 --> 46:23.056
Apologize.

46:24.314 --> 46:25.657
Apologize to me!

46:25.949 --> 46:27.690
All right. Sorry.

46:28.352 --> 46:29.990
I'm sorry!

46:31.688 --> 46:35.192
Where does a lowly
bus driver get such pride?

46:36.260 --> 46:38.297
Goddamn you!

46:38.662 --> 46:40.369
This jerk is driving me crazy!

46:41.131 --> 46:42.371
Say that again.

46:42.766 --> 46:45.474
You idiot, have you gone deaf?

46:45.602 --> 46:47.639
I called you
a lowly bus driver.

46:48.305 --> 46:51.941
Hey, you lowly bus passenger!
What the hell did you say?

46:51.942 --> 46:53.046
Now you're hitting me?

46:53.177 --> 46:55.378
Hey, this bus driver is
hitting a passenger!

46:55.379 --> 46:56.946
- Call the police!
- That's right.

46:56.947 --> 46:59.484
I'm gonna hit a passenger!
Here comes a flip!

46:59.583 --> 47:04.259
Hey, you want to taste the
martial art skills of a marine?

47:04.321 --> 47:09.225
Show me those martial art skills!
I'll rip your balls out!

47:09.226 --> 47:12.361
Stop this!
What are you two doing?

47:12.362 --> 47:13.602
Open the door.

47:13.697 --> 47:15.608
I can't bear to
watch this idiocy.

47:16.133 --> 47:18.374
I said, open the door!

47:19.169 --> 47:20.671
Be thankful
to still have your privates!

47:29.146 --> 47:31.353
You ugly bastard!

47:37.621 --> 47:39.328
You saw that I won, right?

47:39.456 --> 47:41.197
What is wrong with you?

47:41.592 --> 47:42.434
What?

47:42.526 --> 47:44.369
Why are you acting so badly?

47:44.428 --> 47:45.928
What did I do?

47:45.929 --> 47:47.230
What's with you?

47:47.231 --> 47:49.837
Why are you so mean
to everyone?

47:50.133 --> 47:53.239
Is it so annoying and distasteful
to have dinner with me?

47:53.337 --> 47:55.874
Yeah, it's annoying!
Very annoying!

47:56.640 --> 47:59.143
Who wants to date
someone at this age?

47:59.443 --> 48:01.013
I've lived in my own way.

48:01.144 --> 48:03.852
Why'd you show up
and make me all confused?

48:04.848 --> 48:06.885
Well, I'm sorry.

48:07.284 --> 48:09.389
For making you
annoyed and confused.

48:09.753 --> 48:13.098
Well, you can go on
living your own way alone.

48:13.390 --> 48:14.767
Just live that way
to the end.

48:14.858 --> 48:16.030
Right to the end!

48:21.098 --> 48:24.272
Sure, I'll just live alone!

48:26.370 --> 48:30.785
What are you looking at?
What's wrong with living alone?

48:31.041 --> 48:34.614
Why can't that woman
be a little nicer?

48:37.080 --> 48:39.117
Where are your eyes?!

48:40.484 --> 48:42.327
Aren't you the boss's daughter?

48:42.920 --> 48:44.331
Hey- Stop crying!

48:44.421 --> 48:46.401
I've been dumped.

48:47.124 --> 48:48.899
Minsung is going to America.

48:48.959 --> 48:50.336
That skinny kid?

48:50.594 --> 48:51.834
He's a jerk.

48:52.262 --> 48:54.469
Does he think I'm here
because I can't go abroad?

48:55.465 --> 48:56.773
Mr. Kim!

48:56.967 --> 48:59.846
It's okay, you can
go study abroad too.

49:05.208 --> 49:06.881
Hey, skinny!

49:07.244 --> 49:09.087
Get back here!

49:12.249 --> 49:14.024
It's okay, it's okay.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.158
Try the grapes.

49:17.387 --> 49:19.162
- Let's get these.
- Ah...

49:19.556 --> 49:20.156
They're good.

49:20.157 --> 49:21.727
Produce coming through!

49:22.726 --> 49:24.501
Oh. my-

49:25.228 --> 49:27.469
Can't stand to watch them.

49:39.242 --> 49:41.544
Hey, Mr. Kim!
You won't believe this!

49:41.545 --> 49:42.578
What's with you?

49:42.579 --> 49:45.651
This is you, right?
It is! I can't believe it!

49:45.749 --> 49:48.161
It's the no.1 most popular
search for today!

49:48.251 --> 49:51.954
No.1! "Bus Brawl!"
The flower lady's in it, too.

49:51.955 --> 49:52.855
Mr. Kim!

49:52.856 --> 49:57.430
Now you're the neighborhood's
home-grown star, totally!

49:57.494 --> 50:01.497
That young punk was
being rude to Geum-nim.

50:01.498 --> 50:02.865
So I stood up for her.

50:02.866 --> 50:04.868
Hey, Jagalchi.

50:05.335 --> 50:06.469
JEGAL Chung-soc!

50:06.470 --> 50:10.111
What do you think of me?
Am I that mean?

50:11.341 --> 50:12.684
Mr. Kim!

50:14.411 --> 50:15.617
You're this style.

50:16.913 --> 50:19.484
Women, you know what they like?

50:19.683 --> 50:21.253
Men who smile.

50:21.385 --> 50:23.626
Try it once, after me.

50:23.720 --> 50:27.099
From deep inside you,
think of the Flower Lady.

50:27.190 --> 50:31.263
Give me a bright smile!

50:31.561 --> 50:33.472
No, the smile ruins it.

50:33.563 --> 50:36.169
- Not just your mouth.
- Mr. Kim.

50:36.433 --> 50:38.470
The green grapes
are delicious today.

50:38.735 --> 50:39.668
So what?

50:39.669 --> 50:41.904
Didn't you know the
Flower Lady loves grapes?

50:41.905 --> 50:44.006
- Eat them together.
- Why should I?

50:44.007 --> 50:45.041
Forget it.

50:45.042 --> 50:46.342
I'll bring them to her.

50:46.343 --> 50:49.979
Well, it can't be helped.
These really are sweet!

50:49.980 --> 50:51.480
They sure are!
Are they organic?

50:51.481 --> 50:53.051
Hey. wait!

51:02.859 --> 51:03.929
For you.

51:04.694 --> 51:06.002
A present?

51:08.131 --> 51:09.804
Delivery from the boss.

51:10.467 --> 51:12.071
I've delivered them, so...

51:12.536 --> 51:14.106
Bye then.

51:19.910 --> 51:24.017
I wan't acting that way
out of bad intentions.

51:24.548 --> 51:28.325
I admit that I've got
a mean temper.

51:29.219 --> 51:33.190
But it's not that,
I'm just lacking that way.

51:33.623 --> 51:38.299
I don't smile enough,
so you misunderstand.

51:39.563 --> 51:44.410
Yes, it's not like I did
everything right that day either.

51:44.868 --> 51:47.314
Then I'll take it
as an apology.

51:47.604 --> 51:52.713
So will you try again with me?
Then I'll forgive you.

51:53.677 --> 51:55.054
Slowly.

51:57.848 --> 51:59.418
Back straight.

52:01.184 --> 52:02.686
Look straight ahead.

52:04.588 --> 52:06.295
With confidence.

52:09.626 --> 52:12.628
So the 'yes' is up to here now,
don't worry!

52:12.629 --> 52:14.734
I knew you that
you'd come through!

52:14.898 --> 52:17.333
- Wow.
- Hot women really do the trick!

52:17.334 --> 52:19.575
Hey, so let's not lose focus,

52:19.669 --> 52:21.437
- and go in for the kill.
- Let's do it!

52:21.438 --> 52:23.239
Mr KIM loves Chinese seafood.

52:23.240 --> 52:25.379
Let's put my skills to the test.

52:28.345 --> 52:32.521
Today the meal fee is zero,
with unlimited refills!

52:34.784 --> 52:37.822
Mr. Kim, the best Chinese
seafood in Northern Seoul.

52:38.054 --> 52:41.524
I'm so moved by
JK Construction's generosity.

52:41.525 --> 52:43.266
No meal fee!

52:43.827 --> 52:47.798
- JK really knows how to bribe a...
- Hey!

52:48.098 --> 52:50.466
When that last
remaining person

52:50.467 --> 52:52.913
takes out his seal
and goes, stamp!

52:53.003 --> 52:56.576
Our outdated neighborhood
will be streaming in light!

52:57.340 --> 52:59.149
Sunrise, sunset!

53:03.079 --> 53:06.424
It's great for us.
The shop will be worth more.

53:06.550 --> 53:08.984
Our kids will grow taller
and live well.

53:08.985 --> 53:10.853
And the elderly will
get more welfare benefits.

53:10.854 --> 53:14.028
Thanks to that I'll be
reunited with my family.

53:14.124 --> 53:16.331
I'm gonna eat
myself to death today.

53:16.426 --> 53:18.633
The leftovers
can go in here!

53:18.728 --> 53:20.429
Hey Polar Bear,
don't pick at your food.

53:20.430 --> 53:21.330
Eat up!

53:21.331 --> 53:23.072
- Here, eat this.
- Eat.

53:23.300 --> 53:27.749
And you, just one helping.
Let's go eat tripe after!

53:27.837 --> 53:30.511
There's so much food here,
why eat tripe?

53:32.375 --> 53:33.319
I'm leaving.

53:33.577 --> 53:35.454
A-young, you dropped this.

53:36.513 --> 53:38.080
- What?
- She dropped that?

53:38.081 --> 53:39.048
It's not mine.

53:39.049 --> 53:40.549
No this is yours
for sure, menthol.

53:40.550 --> 53:44.053
You took menthol from your
Dad's office, and this is menthol.

53:44.054 --> 53:44.887
Is it peppermint flavor?

53:44.888 --> 53:46.922
You've been smoking!?

53:46.923 --> 53:47.823
No!

53:47.824 --> 53:49.725
What do you mean, no?
Mine keep disappearing!

53:49.726 --> 53:50.960
Now you're stealing
by the pack?

53:50.961 --> 53:54.863
- Jangsu, she's just curious.
- She'll end up smoking anyway!

53:54.864 --> 53:55.798
A-young smokes
menthol, too!

53:55.799 --> 53:56.799
What about you?

53:56.800 --> 53:58.734
Why do you keep
hitting on my dad?

53:58.735 --> 54:01.270
Be discreet, will you?
He's got a daughter.

54:01.271 --> 54:02.638
How dare you talk back!

54:02.639 --> 54:04.516
- You come here!
- Jangsu!

54:07.310 --> 54:08.777
- They're not mine!
- Hurry and go.

54:08.778 --> 54:09.950
Give it.

54:10.480 --> 54:12.756
Those are mine, give it.

54:14.217 --> 54:16.629
You don't smoke, Mr. Kim.
Get over here, you!

54:17.520 --> 54:18.794
Stop it!

54:19.289 --> 54:20.893
Wait till you get home!

54:24.194 --> 54:28.700
Actually, my grandfather is
sick with lung cancer.

54:28.765 --> 54:30.745
When she heard that, she said,

54:31.101 --> 54:32.978
"I've only got my father left."

54:33.670 --> 54:36.583
"What if he gets cancer
from these cigarettes?"

54:37.774 --> 54:38.775
Damn!

54:43.346 --> 54:44.825
Donation box

54:44.914 --> 54:46.086
Supermarket girl!

54:52.489 --> 54:53.467
Why go after her?

54:53.556 --> 54:55.190
Wait till I get
my hands on her.

54:55.191 --> 54:56.392
I'm gonna lock her
up for a month!

54:56.393 --> 54:57.997
Don't be so hard on her.

54:58.261 --> 54:59.831
Or you know
what will happen?

55:00.263 --> 55:01.503
She'll turn out like me.

55:02.232 --> 55:04.644
Wait here.
I'll drive round the block.

55:04.868 --> 55:05.834
I'll come, too!

55:05.835 --> 55:07.636
You go the other way.

55:07.637 --> 55:09.048
Go back inside!

55:09.339 --> 55:10.239
Jangsu!

55:10.240 --> 55:12.413
<i>_</i> Loyalty!
<i>_</i> Loyalty!

55:24.220 --> 55:25.597
I'm hungry!

55:25.722 --> 55:27.998
Hey! Buy us pig's feet!

55:28.091 --> 55:28.924
Treat us!

55:28.925 --> 55:31.327
Make a donation, okay?
Where's the cash?

55:31.328 --> 55:33.308
I don't have... cash.

55:33.396 --> 55:35.171
Don't have... cash?

55:39.969 --> 55:40.743
Hey.

55:42.072 --> 55:43.915
- What's that?
- What the hell?

55:44.007 --> 55:44.883
Hey lady.

55:45.175 --> 55:47.142
We didn't order anything,
so beat it.

55:47.143 --> 55:49.453
Her timing is awesome.

55:49.546 --> 55:52.083
What kind of group
are you, Sistar?

55:52.549 --> 55:54.654
Are they coming to
fight four-on-four?

55:54.751 --> 55:55.593
Who's Hyolyn?

55:55.719 --> 55:56.891
Rm Hyolyn.

55:58.188 --> 56:00.522
It's like an ugly girl showcase here.

56:00.523 --> 56:03.436
Showcase?
What a bitch!

56:03.526 --> 56:05.199
Don't stop me today, okay?

56:05.328 --> 56:07.433
I'm smacking up
an adult today.

56:10.834 --> 56:12.404
Are you from
Majin Commercial High?

56:12.969 --> 56:14.880
You are, aren't you?

56:14.971 --> 56:16.973
Now called
Changsin Information High School.

56:17.073 --> 56:19.975
You've dolled up your uniforms
so I couldn't recognize you.

56:19.976 --> 56:21.421
- Hey, grandma.
- What?

56:21.544 --> 56:24.252
You think we care if
you're from the same school?

56:24.347 --> 56:25.087
Hey!

56:25.181 --> 56:26.455
Let's finish her with one blow.

56:31.087 --> 56:32.054
What are you doing?

56:32.055 --> 56:34.535
I'm going to die today
saving A-young.

56:36.926 --> 56:38.660
I can't fight
through these tears!

56:38.661 --> 56:41.164
Wow, what a cute boyfriend.

56:41.297 --> 56:42.464
Cute.

56:42.465 --> 56:44.843
I'll be nice to you.
Come on!

57:03.453 --> 57:04.686
She's foaming at the mouth?

57:04.687 --> 57:08.396
You attacked her goddamned
pressure points?

57:08.591 --> 57:09.365
Thank you!

57:13.696 --> 57:15.039
Hey!

57:25.942 --> 57:28.644
A little thing like you,
wearing fake eyelashes?

57:28.645 --> 57:30.056
Oh, that hurts!

57:30.113 --> 57:30.955
A-young!

57:32.449 --> 57:33.315
Ouch!

57:33.316 --> 57:35.717
- We're taking your pictures.
- You little babies.

57:35.718 --> 57:38.460
Do this again and I'll come
to your homes, understand?

57:38.555 --> 57:39.321
Yes.

57:39.322 --> 57:40.422
Louder!

57:40.423 --> 57:41.993
Yes!

57:43.226 --> 57:44.068
Thank you.

57:45.128 --> 57:48.837
A-young, anyone here
you want to smack?

57:48.932 --> 57:51.845
- Just pick one, huh?
- So embarrassing.

57:54.237 --> 57:55.079
A-young!

57:55.738 --> 57:56.271
A-young!

57:56.272 --> 57:58.207
- We love you!
- Bye, A-young!

57:58.208 --> 58:00.154
If anyone bothers you, call us!

58:02.111 --> 58:03.146
Yes?

58:09.652 --> 58:11.928
Hello, Geum-nim?

58:12.021 --> 58:13.398
<i>Hello?</i>

58:13.590 --> 58:16.196
Good afternoon,
this is the glasses shop.

58:16.526 --> 58:18.403
Oh, you have
the wrong number.

58:18.528 --> 58:19.905
Good bye.

58:20.163 --> 58:24.077
<i>Ah wait!
Is this Mr. KIM Sungchil?</i>

58:24.934 --> 58:26.106
That's right.

58:26.169 --> 58:29.137
Four days ago
you ordered glasses,

58:29.138 --> 58:30.672
<i>and said you'd
be back the next day.</i>

58:30.673 --> 58:32.118
<i>Do you remember?</i>

58:32.809 --> 58:34.914
No, I won't sell it.

58:35.011 --> 58:36.786
You won't listen to reason!

58:37.146 --> 58:39.649
There's no other
source of money!

58:39.749 --> 58:41.660
This is to save me only?

58:41.818 --> 58:43.619
Min-jung is alone now,

58:43.620 --> 58:45.622
so we need to think
about her future.

58:45.722 --> 58:48.090
You know that's why
I started this.

58:48.091 --> 58:50.662
Why are you being so stubborn?

58:51.094 --> 58:53.734
I've already
discussed it with them!

59:01.271 --> 59:04.650
Sungchil, are you there?
Sungchil!

59:08.177 --> 59:11.181
Ah, you're home.
Have you eaten?

59:11.481 --> 59:13.081
What, is something wrong?

59:13.082 --> 59:14.116
Ah, no.

59:14.117 --> 59:18.566
The cod in the market was
so fresh and big, I bought it.

59:18.621 --> 59:20.464
I'll cook it up
with some radish.

59:20.557 --> 59:23.128
You don't know how
well I can cook, do you?

59:26.195 --> 59:28.232
Do you like your home?

59:28.731 --> 59:31.439
Why do you ask?

59:31.534 --> 59:36.779
You know, living by
yourself, in an old home.

59:37.040 --> 59:38.713
It's a lot of work.

59:38.975 --> 59:42.286
When you get old,
being comfortable is the best.

59:42.879 --> 59:43.645
Hm.

59:43.646 --> 59:45.113
On the way back home,

59:45.114 --> 59:48.789
I was given a pamphlet
about the redevelopment.

59:49.185 --> 59:53.031
I left it on the table,
take a look when you have time.

59:55.592 --> 59:57.902
<i>If JK Construction builds it,
Suyu District will change.</i>

59:58.394 --> 01:00:02.467
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!

01:00:03.566 --> 01:00:06.479
Hey, Mr. Kim!
Why are you here?

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.612
I'm working!

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:10.910
No sign of the boss today.

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.318
Ah, you can't stay here.

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:15.553
Hurry up and
come to the buffet!

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:17.746
What in cripes
are you talking about?

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:20.023
You forgot again!

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:22.451
You don't know
what day it is, do you?

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.022
What day?

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:32.397
<i>Ms IM Geum-nim's
10th (-1) Birthday</i>

01:00:33.229 --> 01:00:35.835
How can your daughter
be such an idiot?

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:39.976
Don't think that I want
you to age a year faster.

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:44.108
Okay, we'll consider it
your early birthday party.

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:45.445
Hello!

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:48.677
- Oh!
- Wow, congratulations!

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:49.588
Thanks for coming.

01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:52.488
It's for good luck, a... fincher?

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:54.357
- Finch.
- Finch, finch.

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:55.892
- Thank you.
- Our pleasure.

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:57.191
Congratulations.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.720
Congratulations, Ms IM.

01:00:58.721 --> 01:00:59.699
Thank you.

01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:00.989
Hello.

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.591
- Thank you for coming.
- Congratulations.

01:01:02.592 --> 01:01:04.970
A big congratulations to you.

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:07.200
I brought him
from the supermarket.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:08.636
Congratulations.

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:11.403
Oh, the buffet!
I'm late!

01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:13.769
Ah, thank you.

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:15.272
Go have a seat.

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:17.979
That's okay.

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.342
What's with you?

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:22.516
You should have told me.

01:01:22.712 --> 01:01:26.216
I just thought you
might feel uncomfortable.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:28.923
Hide and seek!

01:01:30.053 --> 01:01:31.726
Do you see me?

01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:40.865
I've congratulated you,
now I'll go.

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:43.465
No, don't go.

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:46.640
You came all the way here,
have something to eat.

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:48.841
You can sit over there.

01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:50.239
Come.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.774
Eat up.

01:01:52.775 --> 01:01:55.844
What's that?
Where'd you get it?

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:57.085
Over there.

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:01.888
- Is she heavy?
- No.

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:03.151
Don't just pick at your food.

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:04.096
I'm eating.

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:05.325
Eat your fill.

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:33.625
Is there still room
in your stomach?

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:40.095
Try and catch me!

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:41.530
Wait!

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:52.170
This tastes great!

01:02:58.174 --> 01:02:59.174
Water, water!

01:02:59.175 --> 01:03:02.213
Thank you, goodbye!

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.414
- There are a lot of gifts, right?
- Indeed.

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:08.383
- I'll go say goodbye to everyone.
- Okay.

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:09.454
Look here!

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:13.592
How much do you want?

01:03:13.689 --> 01:03:15.457
What do you mean?

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:18.160
How much are you
trying to get from her?

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:19.538
I've no idea what you're saying.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.897
You leave your wife,

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:24.538
and then shamelessly
hit her up for money?

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:28.103
- How much do you need?
- Why are you doing this?

01:03:28.104 --> 01:03:29.938
- I'll give it to you, okay?
- Let go of me!

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:30.772
- How much?
- But...

01:03:30.773 --> 01:03:33.074
- How much do you need?
- Somebody help!

01:03:33.075 --> 01:03:36.852
Tell me! Tell me!

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:39.648
- Mr. Kim!
- How can he be so strong?

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:40.821
Uncle!

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:42.557
Sungchil!

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:50.230
Wait...

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:12.684
What are you doing here?
I was so worried.

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:14.419
I don't know, either...

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:18.895
I know, everything's fine now.
I'm here now.

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:22.824
I thought he was trying
to get money from you.

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:24.566
Yes, I know.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:30.701
There's... a sick person at home.

01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:33.777
It's because of
the hospital fees.

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:37.181
So...

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:45.142
That man isn't my husband,
he's my husband's brother.

01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:48.224
Brother-in-law.

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:55.400
So we've cleared up
the misunderstanding?

01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:57.762
I'm such an idiot.

01:04:57.994 --> 01:05:00.406
No no, it's fine.

01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:01.735
O Kay?

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:03.509
Come on, let's go.

01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:18.558
So you were jealous?
You were, right?

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:20.059
Of course not.

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:24.627
If you felt jealous
because of me,

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:27.332
that means you like me?

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:31.030
Oh, it's raining.

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:46.083
Oh my!

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:49.613
Is this my birthday present?

01:05:52.882 --> 01:05:54.054
How do they look?

01:05:56.953 --> 01:06:00.127
Thanks so much.
I'll use them often.

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:07.741
Today... you were very
pretty in that hanbok.

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:12.344
My first time wearing it
since my daughter's wedding...

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:16.708
Oh, my!

01:06:17.606 --> 01:06:19.586
Reflorescence.

01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:21.688
Look at this!

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:25.659
Have you
heard of reflorescence?

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:30.064
It's when a spring flower
blooms again in the fall.

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:34.262
It survives without dying,
and blooms one last time.

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:37.671
Reflorescence...

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.781
You took out new plates?

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:49.110
Yes, well...

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:52.251
What should I do?
ls the rice ready?

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:54.843
I told you,
just sit down and rest!

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.044
It's my turn today.

01:06:56.045 --> 01:06:58.252
Sol really don't
have to do anything?

01:06:58.714 --> 01:07:01.695
You've been through
too much today.

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:03.151
Watch TV, okay?

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:06.354
Or just sit and
stretch out your legs.

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:07.925
Come on, go in there.

01:07:23.472 --> 01:07:24.906
<i>My name is KIM Sungchil.</i>

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:27.842
<i>If you find me, use the money
in this account for my funeral.</i>

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:29.117
<i>PIN number: 4491.</i>

01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:34.323
Geum-nim!

01:07:39.922 --> 01:07:41.060
Geum-nim!

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:46.227
No, it's not like that.

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:48.868
I just wrote it
for no special reason.

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:50.867
I'm sorry...

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:53.236
I'm sorry...

01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:55.375
I didn't know.

01:07:55.938 --> 01:07:58.540
I didn't know it was so
lonely and hard for you.

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:03.081
No, it's not like that at all.
Okay?

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:05.258
I'm sorry.

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:12.821
Look at the lens.
That's good.

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:15.757
Okay bride and groom,
look affectionate.

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:18.693
Move in closer.
I'll shoot it on 3.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:21.037
It's been ages
since I've been here.

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:30.379
What, have you
been here before?

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:35.545
No, I... have I?

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:59.634
We have gathered in God's church
with our hearts as one.

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:03.377
We are together
with these two people

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.612
at their most precious moment.

01:09:05.707 --> 01:09:07.948
God, please give
your benevolent blessing

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:10.580
to these two who are
about to marry.

01:09:10.712 --> 01:09:14.251
We humbly ask God the Father,
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:17.158
to let these two become one.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.126
Let us pray.

01:09:21.122 --> 01:09:26.232
Please hear our prayers,
let this bride and groom...

01:10:03.899 --> 01:10:06.846
What did you pray for
so fervently back there?

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:11.784
It's a secret between me
and the Virgin Mary.

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:15.512
You know...

01:10:17.079 --> 01:10:19.081
It's a really strange feeling.

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:23.964
I went into the cathedral,

01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:28.733
and it was like
I'd been there before,

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:32.171
or perhaps seen
it in a dream...

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:34.897
Gosh.

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:42.214
So, your husband is...?

01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:44.478
My husband...

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:49.617
When I think of him,
I feel so sad.

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:55.526
Sungchil, don't you
feel happy now?

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:59.525
No? Is it just me?

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:04.170
I just wish that for
as long as we're alive,

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.197
we could feel this happy.

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:10.137
Think good thoughts,

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.581
and say only good things.

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:19.477
One, two, three.

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:21.949
One, two, three.

01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:24.121
One, two...

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:42.107
<i>Geum-nim, 1 pm.

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:19.039
Sungchil!

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:23.778
Sungchil!

01:12:29.945 --> 01:12:32.551
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I forgot.

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:36.351
It's my fault for forgetting
my phone at home.

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:37.552
I thought of going
to the road,

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:40.363
but worried we might
take different paths.

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:43.197
It's fine, things
can slip your mind.

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:49.137
Sometimes it's not
just a mind slip...

01:12:49.732 --> 01:12:54.112
Sometimes I can't
remember a thing.

01:12:54.837 --> 01:12:57.044
I shouldn't forget
meetings with you.

01:12:57.139 --> 01:12:58.812
It's the same with me.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.376
When you reach our age
it's the same for everyone.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:03.516
I don't think it's just that...

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:07.192
If you're worried,
want to visit the hospital?

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:11.857
Um, hospitals and me don't...

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:17.768
What are you so scared of?
Like a kid.

01:13:20.996 --> 01:13:22.942
I'll just do a few more tests.

01:13:22.998 --> 01:13:24.102
Is that okay?

01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:28.845
I think he's a bit nervous.

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:31.384
They're simple tests,
so no need to worry.

01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:32.781
Ah, yes...

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:47.690
My test results are
coming out today, so...

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:51.502
Ah, I see.

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:54.496
You scared me!

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:55.970
What's with you?

01:13:56.064 --> 01:13:57.543
Life is so hard.

01:13:57.666 --> 01:14:00.738
What's so hard for a
young man like you?

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:02.210
You know,

01:14:02.404 --> 01:14:03.906
it's harder for the young.

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:05.973
There are so many
days left to live.

01:14:05.974 --> 01:14:08.648
I wish I had so many days.

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:11.654
But Mr. Kim,
you must be happy now.

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:13.886
Dating, at your age!

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:15.622
Hey!

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:18.396
Where do you get
that strength?

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:20.900
What's gotten into you?

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:23.602
Are you dating
because you're strong?

01:14:23.992 --> 01:14:25.300
Oh, a real man!

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:27.572
Sure enough,
men need strength.

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:30.735
Hello?

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:33.143
<i>Hello, is this KIM Sungchil?</i>

01:14:33.268 --> 01:14:34.542
This is the hospital.

01:14:34.903 --> 01:14:36.576
Your results are in.

01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:38.782
<i>Everything looks normal.</i>

01:14:39.074 --> 01:14:43.489
<i>As I said, it's just a light dementia
that people get in old age.</i>

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:45.057
Yes, I understand.

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:48.449
<i>Still, if you sense anything strange,
come right in just in case.</i>

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:50.396
Yes, yes! Thank you!

01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:53.896
Huh? Looks like you
got some good news!

01:14:54.056 --> 01:14:56.400
It's the first time I've
seen a real smile on you.

01:14:56.959 --> 01:15:01.305
This is how you should smile.
With your eyes and nose!

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:05.602
Well, that should
put him at ease.

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.706
Yes, thank you.

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:16.679
Oh, right.

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:19.520
We're learning to waltz.

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:22.721
It's exercise, and it helps me.

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:25.489
And the medicine?

01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:27.294
Yes, sure.

01:15:27.589 --> 01:15:29.694
I'm talking about you.

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:32.897

You're doing well.

01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:31.953
He can't refuse now, can he?

01:16:31.954 --> 01:16:33.558
- He's about to be pinned.
- That's right!

01:16:34.356 --> 01:16:37.200
Everyone thinks it's
a done deal now!

01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:39.636
Even if it takes
some time, let's wait.

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:42.975
I think we'll regret this later.

to see me dead?

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:47.643

01:16:56.812 --> 01:16:58.450
Just trust me
and start the construction.

01:16:58.747 --> 01:16:59.919
I'll take responsibility.

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.265

01:27:11.192 --> 01:27:14.639
She's been sick all this time.

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:16.496
What are you talking about?

01:27:16.497 --> 01:27:18.067
She's been sick all along,

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:19.967
but now she's... a bit sicker.

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:21.276
Stop it!

01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:31.720
Dad, look at me!
Look!

01:27:35.049 --> 01:27:40.431
Dad, I'm Min-jung.

01:27:41.322 --> 01:27:48.797
Your daughter, KIM Min-jung.

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:54.975
And this is KIM Jang-su.

01:27:55.937 --> 01:28:00.647
Not your boss,
but your son.

01:28:03.177 --> 01:28:07.353
Do you really not
remember anything?

01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:11.387
Dad, please!

01:28:11.919 --> 01:28:15.093
Dad, can't you at least
remember Mom?

01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:17.832
At the least...

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.764
you should remember Mom!

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:24.667
Please, Dad!

01:28:24.832 --> 01:28:25.867
Mind-Ling"-

01:28:29.737 --> 01:28:30.681
This way.

01:29:33.234 --> 01:29:36.272
Oh my god, are you okay?

01:29:36.537 --> 01:29:37.447
Doctor!

01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:55.157
Grandpa!

01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:57.870
Are you awake?

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:01.137
Do you feel okay?

01:30:27.855 --> 01:30:29.357
Sit down.

01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:31.269
Okay.

01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:43.042
This is our family album.

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:56.625
Do you remember?

01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:13.905
<i>Jangsu's Store</i>

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:16.845
Jangsu, Mom, hurry up!

01:31:20.408 --> 01:31:21.284
Honey!

01:31:21.576 --> 01:31:22.646
Mom!

01:31:23.444 --> 01:31:24.582
Okay...

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:29.387
Everyone look here.
Okay...

01:31:34.422 --> 01:31:36.299
Okay, let's smile!

01:31:50.171 --> 01:31:52.014
This is your diary.

01:31:56.043 --> 01:31:58.853
<i>IM Geum-nim Wife
KIM Jangsu Son</i>

01:32:00.248 --> 01:32:04.162
<i>Today is December 10, 2013.</i>

01:32:04.585 --> 01:32:07.896
<i>I've contracted Alzheimer's
in my frontal lobe,</i>

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:10.968
<i>commonly known as dementia.</i>

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:15.700
<i>Every clay I forget something.</i>

01:32:16.964 --> 01:32:21.504
<i>So there may come a time
when I forget everything.</i>

01:32:23.437 --> 01:32:26.281
<i>Today is January 5, 2014.</i>

01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:30.553
<i>I got lost on the street
I've lived all my life.</i>

01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:39.553
- Oh, how did you get this spot!
- Before it's too late,

01:32:39.554 --> 01:32:40.820
<i>I got my wife the flower shop</i>

01:32:40.821 --> 01:32:42.801
<i>- she always wanted.</i>
- I <i>love it!</i>

01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:46.695
<i>So that she might be
happy without me.</i>

01:32:49.864 --> 01:32:52.105
<i>My wife has late stage
pancreatic cancer.</i>

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:57.182
<i>Will I be able to remember
that she's sick?</i>

01:32:58.773 --> 01:33:01.686
<i>I'm scared that I could
forget her completely.</i>

01:33:06.814 --> 01:33:09.658
I'm scared, honey.

01:33:10.184 --> 01:33:12.452
What if I go in there alone,
and don't come back?

01:33:12.453 --> 01:33:16.560
If you die,
I'll die right after you.

01:33:16.958 --> 01:33:20.667
So be sure to come out alive.

01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:22.564
Yes, I will.

01:33:23.464 --> 01:33:25.876
But sing a song for me.

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.311
Sing in a strong voice.

01:33:29.036 --> 01:33:30.242
Okay.

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:50.965
All by myself.

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:59.207
I want to know you.

01:34:00.768 --> 01:34:08.346
All by myself.

01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:16.428
I want to have you.

01:34:18.252 --> 01:34:24.464
All by myself.

01:34:25.559 --> 01:34:32.101
I will love you...

01:34:33.534 --> 01:34:41.715
Forever... forever...

01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:50.121
I want to live happily.

01:34:50.951 --> 01:34:54.922
<i>I had a long conversation
with a houseguest,</i>

01:34:55.389 --> 01:34:57.130
<i>but now I realize,</i>

01:34:57.191 --> 01:34:59.398
<i>it was my son.</i>

01:34:59.694 --> 01:35:02.607
<i>I've started to
forget my children.</i>

01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:05.036
<i>I've become baggage.</i>

01:35:05.132 --> 01:35:06.800
We'll take care of it ourselves.

01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:09.543
Listen to me, and send
him to a nursing home.

01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:11.237
He insists on going himself!

01:35:11.238 --> 01:35:14.340
He has his children,
why should he go there?

01:35:14.341 --> 01:35:15.786
Then what about your mother?

01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:17.444
You want there to be
a double funeral?

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:18.978
Okay Uncle,
we understand you.

01:35:18.979 --> 01:35:20.686
We'll figure out some solution.

01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:22.089
Just wait a bit.

01:35:22.249 --> 01:35:24.456
I'll look after him.
You stop crying.

01:35:24.752 --> 01:35:25.992
He can probably hear us.

01:35:26.587 --> 01:35:27.998
Jangsu! Over here!

01:35:28.456 --> 01:35:29.889
- Somethings wrong with Dad.
- Why?

01:35:29.890 --> 01:35:31.324
He won't answer.

01:35:31.325 --> 01:35:32.736
- He's inside?
- Yes.

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:35.470
Dad, it's Jangsu.

01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:37.464
Oh no!

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:41.880
Dad, I'm here! Dad!

01:35:43.504 --> 01:35:46.314
Your mother's illness
was a big shock to him.

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:51.054
Your father believes
that he's living alone.

01:35:51.145 --> 01:35:53.546
He probably won't
remember his family.

01:35:53.547 --> 01:35:55.288
It's a kind of delusion.

01:35:55.549 --> 01:35:57.825
It's unusual in Alzheimer's.

01:35:58.652 --> 01:36:01.020
But it's to avoid feeling
like baggage to his family.

01:36:01.021 --> 01:36:03.695
A defense mechanism,
you might say.

01:36:07.361 --> 01:36:09.671
<i>Although it's best not
to change his environment,</i>

01:36:09.764 --> 01:36:13.099
<i>he may become suspicious,
stubborn or cruel.</i>

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:17.344
From 8 am to 6pm,
I'll be in charge at the mart.

01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:18.610
A-young!

01:36:19.073 --> 01:36:22.350
When he gets off work,
you follow him home.

01:36:24.378 --> 01:36:27.257
Min-jung, you take care of
cleaning, dishes, and laundry.

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:29.249
Da-young, what did I tell you?

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:30.524
Hide and seek!

01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:34.998
I'll cook his rice.
He said mine was the best.

01:36:37.992 --> 01:36:40.063
<i>If you're going to
care for him at home,</i>

01:36:40.227 --> 01:36:43.106
<i>he mustn't know that
he has Alzheimer's.</i>

01:36:55.342 --> 01:36:57.322
I feel so sorry for Mom.

01:36:58.379 --> 01:37:05.695
What will I do if she dies?

01:37:07.721 --> 01:37:09.359
I read his diary.

01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:13.002
He used to play soccer.

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:15.165
Circling the country,

01:37:15.563 --> 01:37:18.601
with little to eat
and nothing but hardship.

01:37:23.604 --> 01:37:27.643
I never knew, and always blamed
him for not letting me play.

01:37:30.544 --> 01:37:31.887
Do you remember?

01:37:32.012 --> 01:37:33.079
When you were a student,

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:36.186
he bound your diaries
together like a book.

01:37:36.817 --> 01:37:38.819
I found it in his house.

01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:41.229
You know why he kept it?

01:37:42.289 --> 01:37:45.327
Because his daughter
was going to do great things.

01:37:45.459 --> 01:37:49.373
Become famous,
and then he'd give you that.

01:37:53.167 --> 01:37:57.309
Dad said that?

01:37:57.872 --> 01:37:58.907
Yeah.

01:38:04.545 --> 01:38:06.047
And this father,

01:38:08.048 --> 01:38:11.188
he saw my wife die,
and you get divorced.

01:38:11.552 --> 01:38:13.293
A nail in his heart.

01:38:13.821 --> 01:38:15.767
Whenever anything
bad happened,

01:38:16.223 --> 01:38:19.670
he always blamed himself,
and said sorry.

01:38:20.628 --> 01:38:21.766
Oh. my-

01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:24.400
Dad!

01:38:55.462 --> 01:38:57.772
I stopped by
the flower festival,

01:38:59.199 --> 01:39:02.408
and those delicate things
resembled you a lot.

01:39:03.103 --> 01:39:04.810
Like your sisters.

01:39:08.208 --> 01:39:12.122
But if you had arrived,

01:39:13.213 --> 01:39:15.215
they would have
all withered away.

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:40.482
You're my daughter.

01:39:42.476 --> 01:39:44.012
You are, right?

01:39:45.879 --> 01:39:50.750
Even now,
I can't remember you.

01:39:50.751 --> 01:39:52.560
I wish I could.

01:39:53.554 --> 01:39:57.400
I try so stubbornly to
remember you, but I can't.

01:39:58.292 --> 01:40:00.568
What should I do?

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:03.103
Dad...

01:40:03.964 --> 01:40:07.241
What should I do
about this mess?

01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:16.452
I'm sorry.

01:40:18.612 --> 01:40:21.559
Min-jung, I'm sorry.

01:40:22.216 --> 01:40:23.957
No, Dad...

01:40:24.918 --> 01:40:26.261
No.

01:40:27.154 --> 01:40:28.724
It's okay, Dad.

01:40:39.967 --> 01:40:41.344
Jangsu!

01:40:43.904 --> 01:40:45.383
Yes, father.

01:40:45.839 --> 01:40:47.409
You used to say.

01:40:47.775 --> 01:40:49.083
Children are like

01:40:50.344 --> 01:40:53.450
a heavy stone that sits
in a part of your chest.

01:40:54.214 --> 01:40:56.558
So Dad, you don't have
to remember us.

01:40:58.218 --> 01:41:00.926
We'll remain stubbornly
in your heart.

01:41:01.188 --> 01:41:02.667
Don't worry about it.

01:41:10.864 --> 01:41:14.778
Kids, let me request one thing.

01:41:15.803 --> 01:41:18.340
For me, and for her,

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:21.920
there's really
not much time left.

01:41:22.443 --> 01:41:24.047
From this point on,

01:41:25.712 --> 01:41:30.889
let me spend time with
the woman I remember.

01:41:31.151 --> 01:41:34.428
Yes, father, we will.

01:41:41.028 --> 01:41:42.507
Take your
grandfather's hand.

01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:51.178
Dad!

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:03.824
<i>IM Geum-nim, KIM Sungchil</i>

01:42:04.418 --> 01:42:06.219
All this time
we've been patient,

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:08.496
pushing for the
redevelopment of District 1.

01:42:08.789 --> 01:42:12.430
But ultimately, because
of one person's refusal,

01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:17.236
we will pitch a redevelopment
contract to District 2.

01:42:18.599 --> 01:42:19.475
Let's go.

01:42:19.633 --> 01:42:20.703
Good bye!

01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:23.881
I thought I might have a son
thanks to redevelopment.

01:42:24.171 --> 01:42:25.538
I thought we were
celebrating too early.

01:42:25.539 --> 01:42:29.248
Hello, I reserved a ticket
for the Philippines?

01:42:30.043 --> 01:42:31.215
Please cancel it.

01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:33.651
Cancel KIM Chi-sods ticket!

01:42:33.747 --> 01:42:36.694
If you cancel,
there's a penalty.

01:42:41.588 --> 01:42:42.965
- Quit smoking!
- What?

01:42:43.223 --> 01:42:45.362
It's your daughter's wish.

01:42:46.727 --> 01:42:47.705
Here.

01:42:49.396 --> 01:42:50.263
Don't take it!

01:42:50.264 --> 01:42:51.631
I'll eat my hat
if that's a seal.

01:42:51.632 --> 01:42:53.202
- His seal! His seal!
- Ms PARK!

01:42:54.034 --> 01:42:54.767
Yes?

01:42:54.768 --> 01:42:56.270
What's your full name?

01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:59.238
PARK In-soon, sir!

01:42:59.239 --> 01:43:01.310
'In' meaning virtue,
'Soon' meaning kindness!

01:43:01.542 --> 01:43:02.247
Yes!

01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:03.548
- Boss.
- Yes?

01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:07.213
People need a partner.

01:43:07.214 --> 01:43:08.215
Well...

01:43:08.315 --> 01:43:09.982
Be good to her, or else!

01:43:09.983 --> 01:43:12.054
Ah, yes, sir!

01:43:12.519 --> 01:43:14.487
Wait, we don't
have time for this.

01:43:14.488 --> 01:43:16.092
- Oh, you're right!
- Thank you, sir!

01:43:18.392 --> 01:43:20.895
Wait, team manager!

01:43:30.971 --> 01:43:32.882
You look like
a newlywed today.

01:43:37.678 --> 01:43:39.715
If you feel the
slightest bit strange,

01:43:42.049 --> 01:43:44.825
call immediately.

01:43:46.019 --> 01:43:51.935
Call me first, okay?

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:54.932
<i>All right.</i>

01:44:09.243 --> 01:44:11.018
Give me your hand.

01:44:17.851 --> 01:44:19.853
Promise me
before opening it.

01:44:21.355 --> 01:44:25.929
Let's not cry when
the first one of us dies.

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:29.905
After all, it will just be
a short separation.

01:44:29.997 --> 01:44:31.533
All right, Geum-nim?
