00:41.680 --> 00:46.834
By 300 AD, the Roman Empire
extended from Arabia to Britain.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.669
But they wanted more.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.273
More land.

00:53.360 --> 00:57.069
More peoples
loyal and subservient to Rome.

00:58.320 --> 01:03.394
But no people so important
as the powerful Sarmatians to the east.

01:04.640 --> 01:07.677
Thousands died on that field.

01:07.760 --> 01:12.675
And when the smoke cleared on the fourth
day, the only Sarmatian soldiers left alive

01:12.760 --> 01:17.788
were members of the decimated
but legendary cavalry.

01:17.880 --> 01:23.398
The Romans, impressed by their bravery
and horsemanship, spared their lives.

01:23.480 --> 01:24.629
452 AD

01:24.720 --> 01:30.352
In exchange, these warriors were
incorporated into the Roman military.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.314
Better they had died that day.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.311
(neighing)

01:50.200 --> 01:52.316
Father.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.311
They are here.

01:57.080 --> 02:00.914
For the second part of the bargain they
struck indebted not only themselves...

02:01.000 --> 02:02.479
The day has come.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.597
..but also their sons,
and their sons, and so on,

02:05.680 --> 02:08.399
to serve the empire as knights.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.750
I was such a son.

02:24.880 --> 02:29.396
There is a legend that
fallen knights return as great horses.

02:29.480 --> 02:33.029
He has seen what awaits you,
and he will protect you.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.954
Lancelot! Lancelot!

02:38.120 --> 02:40.395
Lancelot.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.274
Don't be afraid. I will return.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.638
- How long shall we be gone?
- 15 years,

03:10.720 --> 03:14.918
not including the months it'll take
to get to your post.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.309
Lancelot!

03:19.400 --> 03:21.436
(all shout out "Rus!")

03:42.280 --> 03:46.751
(Lancelot) Our post was Britain -
or at least the southern half,

03:46.840 --> 03:51.709
for the land was divided by a 73-mile wall
built three centuries before us

03:51.800 --> 03:56.032
to protect the empire from
the native fighters of the north.

03:56.120 --> 03:59.317
So, as our forefathers had done,

03:59.400 --> 04:03.518
we made our way and reported
to our Roman commander in Britain,

04:03.600 --> 04:06.910
ancestrally named for the first Artorius,

04:07.000 --> 04:08.911
or Arthur.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.197
15 YEARS LATER

04:25.880 --> 04:28.792
Ah, as promised, the bishop's carriage.

04:29.960 --> 04:33.873
- Our freedom, Bors.
- Mm. I can almost taste it.

04:35.640 --> 04:38.234
And your passage to Rome, Arthur.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.952
(horse whinnies)

05:20.600 --> 05:21.589
Argh!

05:21.680 --> 05:23.318
(war cries)

05:24.200 --> 05:25.679
Woads!

05:32.400 --> 05:35.073
(uproar, swords clinking)

05:56.680 --> 05:59.240
Yaa-rgh!

06:01.960 --> 06:03.473
Yah!

06:17.200 --> 06:19.270
Argh!

06:39.800 --> 06:41.119
Argh!

07:28.360 --> 07:30.430
(triumphant cry)

07:30.880 --> 07:33.440
Rus! Aagh!

07:40.120 --> 07:41.758
Rus!

07:44.400 --> 07:45.992
Rus.

07:52.360 --> 07:57.639
Gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta
tu in mulieribus et Dominus tecum.

07:57.720 --> 08:01.508
Benedicta tu in mulieribus.
Benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.033
Benedicta tu in mulieribus...

08:03.120 --> 08:06.715
Save your prayers, boy.
Your god doesn't live here.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.679
Why did Merlin send you south of the wall?

08:31.040 --> 08:33.837
Spill my blood with Excalibur and...

08:33.919 --> 08:36.035
make this ground holy.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.190
Pick it up.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.075
Pick it up.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.190
- Bors.
- What a bloody mess.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.230
That's not the bishop.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.598
God help us.

09:50.520 --> 09:54.399
- What are they?
- Blue demons that eat Christians alive.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.232
You're not a Christian, are you?

09:58.080 --> 10:00.355
Does this really work?

10:01.080 --> 10:03.514
(mutters gibberish)

10:09.280 --> 10:10.759
Nothing.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.035
Maybe I'm not doin' it right.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.673
(man chuckling) Arthur!

10:16.760 --> 10:20.435
Arthur Castus. Your father's image.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.875
I haven't seen you since childhood.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.316
Bishop Germanius. Welcome to Britain.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.990
I see your military skills
are still of use to you.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.071
Your device worked.

10:32.160 --> 10:35.789
Ancient tricks of an ancient dog.

10:39.400 --> 10:44.952
And these are the great Sarmatian knights
we have heard so much of in Rome.

10:49.160 --> 10:52.596
I thought the Woads control
the north of Hadrian's Wall.

10:52.680 --> 10:55.035
They do, but they
occasionally venture south.

10:55.120 --> 10:59.033
Rome's anticipated withdrawal from Britain
has only increased their daring.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.715
- (man) Woads?
- British rebels who hate Rome.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.472
Men who want their country back.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.472
- Who leads them?
- He's called Merlin.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.755
A dark magician, some say.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.798
Tristan, ride ahead
and make sure the road is clear.

11:12.880 --> 11:17.078
Please do not worry, Bishop.
We will protect you.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.593
Oh.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.478
I've no doubt, Commander.

11:21.560 --> 11:23.471
No doubt.

11:34.120 --> 11:38.318
Dozens don't worry me
nearly so much as thousands.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.311
Thousands?

11:53.120 --> 11:57.796
Well, now that we're free men,
I'm gonna drink till I can't piss straight.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.872
- You do that every night.
- I never could piss straight.

12:00.960 --> 12:04.669
Too much of myself to handle...
down there.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.637
Well, it's a problem.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.154
No, really, it is. It's a problem.

12:09.240 --> 12:15.475
- It's like a baby's arm holding an apple.
- (all)...baby's arm holding an apple.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.391
(laughter)

12:44.840 --> 12:47.434
I don't like him, that Roman.

12:47.520 --> 12:51.479
If he's here to discharge us,
why doesn't he just give us our papers?

12:51.560 --> 12:54.677
- Is this your happy face?
- (Bors laughs)

12:54.760 --> 12:57.149
Galahad, do you still
not know the Romans?

12:57.240 --> 12:59.470
They won't scratch their arses
without holding a ceremony.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.597
Why don't you just kill him,
and then discharge yourself after?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.434
I don't kill for pleasure, unlike some.

13:06.680 --> 13:10.036
Well, you should try it someday.
You might get a taste for it.

13:10.720 --> 13:14.633
- It's a part of you. It's in your blood.
- No, no, no. No.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.231
As of tomorrow
this was all just a bad memory.

13:18.320 --> 13:19.753
Ohh.

13:20.480 --> 13:25.076
I've often thought about what going home
would mean after all this. What will I do?

13:25.160 --> 13:27.071
It's different for Galahad.

13:27.160 --> 13:30.357
I've been in this life longer than the other.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.913
So much for home.
It's not so clear in my memory.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.596
You speak for yourself. It's cold back there
and everyone I know is dead and buried.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.116
Besides, I have, I think, a dozen children.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.835
Eleven.

13:45.920 --> 13:50.152
You listen. When the Romans leave here,
we'll have the run of all this place.

13:50.240 --> 13:54.028
I'll be governor in my own village
and Dagonet will be my personal guard

13:54.120 --> 13:57.032
and royal arse-kisser. Won't you, Dag?

13:57.120 --> 14:00.795
First thing I will do when I get home is
find a beautiful Sarmatian woman to wed.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.836
A beautiful Sarmatian woman?

14:02.920 --> 14:05.673
Why do you think we left in the first place?

14:05.760 --> 14:07.671
(moos like a cow)

14:10.760 --> 14:12.830
What about you, Lancelot?
What are your plans for home?

14:12.920 --> 14:16.071
Well, if this woman of Gawain's
is as beautiful as he claims,

14:16.160 --> 14:18.879
I expect to be spending
a lot of time at Gawain's house.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.997
- His wife will welcome the company.
- I see. And what will I be doing?

14:22.080 --> 14:26.870
Wondering at your good fortune
that all your children look like me.

14:26.960 --> 14:30.794
Is that before or after I hit you with my axe?

14:32.240 --> 14:33.195
(whistles)

14:39.760 --> 14:42.718
Where you been, now? Where you been?

14:43.400 --> 14:46.039
And what will you do, Arthur,
when you return to your beloved Rome?

14:46.120 --> 14:48.873
Give thanks to God that I survived to see it.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.315
You and your god! You disturb me.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.358
I want peace, Lancelot. I've had enough.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.751
- You should visit me.
- Ah!

14:56.840 --> 14:59.229
It's a magnificent place, Rome.

14:59.320 --> 15:02.756
Ordered, civilised, advanced.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.193
A breeding ground of arrogant fools.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.875
The greatest minds in all the lands
have come together in one sacred place

15:07.960 --> 15:09.632
to help make mankind free.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.311
And the women?

15:25.720 --> 15:27.790
(guard) Open the gate!

15:57.640 --> 15:59.153
- Welcome back, Arthur.
- Jols.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.117
Lancelot.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.319
Bishop, please, my quarters
have been made available to you.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.834
Oh, yes. I must rest.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.911
(Bors chuckles lewdly)

16:15.960 --> 16:17.678
- Where have you been?
- Oh...

16:17.760 --> 16:21.719
- I've been waiting for you.
- Oh, my little flower. Such... passion!

16:25.800 --> 16:27.597
Where's my Gilly? Gilly.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.033
- You been fighting?
- Yes.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.189
- You been winning?
- Yes.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.191
That's my boy.
Come on, all my other bastards!

16:32.280 --> 16:34.714
(all cheer)

16:47.880 --> 16:49.791
Pelagius.

16:51.200 --> 16:54.476
Very kind of Arthur to give up his room.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.438
But, of course, it is to be expected.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.636
(knocking)

17:04.720 --> 17:08.473
Sir, I'm here to escort you
to the fortress hall.

17:15.280 --> 17:19.193
When my master meets with your knights,
he must be seated last

17:19.280 --> 17:22.113
and he must be seated
at the head of the table.

17:22.200 --> 17:26.113
Your master can plonk his holy arse
wherever he chooses.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.794
(laughter)

17:28.880 --> 17:33.351
His Eminence, Bishop Naius Germanius.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.316
A round table?
What sort of evil is this?

17:43.520 --> 17:45.954
Arthur says for men to be men
they must first all be equal.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.474
I was given to understand
there would be more of you.

17:48.560 --> 17:52.189
There were. We have been
fighting here for 15 years, Bishop.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.555
Oh, of course.

17:54.640 --> 17:58.952
Arthur and his knights
have served with courage

17:59.040 --> 18:05.388
to maintain the honour of Rome's empire
on this last outpost of our glory.

18:05.480 --> 18:09.155
Rome is most indebted
to you noble knights.

18:09.240 --> 18:12.198
To your final days
as servants to the empire.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.669
Day. Not days.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.716
The Pope's taken
a personal interest in you.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.189
He inquires after each of you,

18:22.280 --> 18:28.469
and is curious to know if your knights have
converted to the word of Our Saviour or...?

18:28.560 --> 18:32.519
They retain the religion of their forefathers.
I have never questioned that.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.477
Of course, of course.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.790
They are pagans. Hm?

18:38.680 --> 18:41.956
For our part, the Church
has deemed such beliefs innocence,

18:42.040 --> 18:45.794
but you, Arthur,
your path to God is through Pelagius?

18:46.200 --> 18:49.715
- I saw his image in your room.
- He took my father's place for me.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.951
His teachings on free will and equality
have been a great influence.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.554
I look forward to our reunion in Rome.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.039
Ah.

18:57.120 --> 19:00.635
Rome awaits your arrival
with great anticipation.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.392
You are a hero.

19:02.480 --> 19:06.268
In Rome, you will live out your days
in honour and wealth.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.915
Alas...

19:10.760 --> 19:14.514
Alas, we are all but players
in an ever-changing world.

19:14.600 --> 19:19.196
Barbarians from every corner
are almost at Rome's door.

19:19.280 --> 19:24.593
Because of this, Rome and the Holy Father
have decided to remove ourselves

19:24.680 --> 19:28.719
from indefensible outposts,
such as Britain.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.953
What will become of Britain
is not our concern any more.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.873
I suppose the Saxons will claim it soon.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.030
- Saxons?
- Yes.

19:37.120 --> 19:41.193
In the north a massive
Saxon incursion has begun.

19:41.280 --> 19:45.478
- The Saxons only claim what they kill.
- And only kill everything.

19:45.560 --> 19:49.553
So you would just
leave the land to the Woads.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.392
And I risked my life for nothing.

19:51.480 --> 19:52.674
Hm.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.591
Gentlemen,

19:54.680 --> 19:59.117
your discharge papers with safe conduct
throughout the Roman Empire.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.875
But first, I must have a word
with your commander.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.753
- In private.
- We have no secrets.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.951
(slams table)

20:15.240 --> 20:20.155
Come. Let's leave Roman business
to Romans.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.870
Let it go, Bors.

20:33.320 --> 20:37.438
Rome has issued a final order
for you and your men.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.919
Final order?

20:39.000 --> 20:43.516
You are to travel north
to rescue the family of Marius Honorius

20:43.600 --> 20:48.435
and return, in particular,
with Marius's son, Alecto.

20:49.280 --> 20:54.559
Alecto is the Pope's
favourite godchild and pupil.

20:54.960 --> 20:59.829
It is his destiny to become a bishop,
perhaps even pope one day.

20:59.920 --> 21:03.117
On this day you ask this of my men.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.631
On this day.

21:11.760 --> 21:15.389
They have risked their lives for 15 years
for a cause not of their own.

21:15.480 --> 21:19.792
And now, on the day they are to be
liberated, you send them on a mission

21:19.880 --> 21:22.713
which is far more dangerous
than any other they have undertaken.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.598
You tell me, Bishop,
how do I go to my men and tell them

21:25.680 --> 21:28.478
that instead of freedom I offer death?

21:28.560 --> 21:32.997
If your men are truly the knights
of legend, perhaps some will survive.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.957
If it is God's will.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.951
Your men want to go home,

21:37.040 --> 21:41.830
and to get home they need to cross
the entire breadth of the Roman Empire.

21:42.360 --> 21:46.433
Deserters would be hunted down like dogs.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.991
Will you defy the Pope, Arthur?

21:49.080 --> 21:51.150
Rome? God himself?

21:51.240 --> 21:53.310
Everything I've done has been
for the Church and for Rome.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.073
Do not mistake a loyal soldier
for a fool, Germanius.

21:56.160 --> 21:59.948
Would you leave a defenceless
Roman boy, destined to lead our Church,

22:00.040 --> 22:02.270
at the hands of the Saxons?

22:03.400 --> 22:08.076
Fulfill this mission, and your men
will receive their discharge.

22:08.600 --> 22:13.310
Their papers will be waiting here
the moment they return.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.879
You have my word.

22:16.280 --> 22:20.637
You think very hard upon that vow, Bishop,
for I will hold you to it.

22:22.080 --> 22:25.595
Break it, and no Roman legion,

22:26.800 --> 22:28.711
papal army,

22:30.200 --> 22:32.509
nor God himself will protect you.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.077
That is my word.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.437
- (man) She gave me fleas.
- (man #2) You better hope they're fleas.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.554
Best of three.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.994
(baby mewling)

22:57.080 --> 22:58.752
Who wants another drink?

22:58.840 --> 23:01.274
- (Lancelot) Ahh.
- (sighs)

23:01.360 --> 23:03.316
When you gonna leave Bors
and come home with me?

23:03.400 --> 23:05.868
My lover is watching you.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.639
Mmm...

23:16.720 --> 23:19.234
You look nothing like him.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.912
You're all Bors.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.755
- Tristan...
- How do you do that?

23:28.400 --> 23:29.992
I aim for the middle.

23:30.280 --> 23:32.271
Oh, they want more!

23:32.360 --> 23:35.875
- Here. Be a mother to your son.
- Oh, come here.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.470
Dagonet, where you been?
We've got plans to make.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.717
Here, please. Sing.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.119
- No.
- Just a last one.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.078
- No, I'm trying to work.
- Come sing. Shut up!

23:47.160 --> 23:49.674
Vanora will sing.

23:49.760 --> 23:52.513
- (Vanora) No, no.
- (chants of "Sing!")

23:53.480 --> 23:56.995
- (man) Sing about home.
- (Gawain) Don't drop the baby.

23:59.480 --> 24:03.439
§ Land of bear and land of eagle

24:03.520 --> 24:07.672
§ Land that gave us birth and blessing

24:07.760 --> 24:11.719
§ Land that called us ever homewards

24:11.800 --> 24:15.713
§ We will go home across the mountains

24:15.800 --> 24:19.759
§ We will go home
We will go home

24:19.840 --> 24:24.038
§ We will go home across the mountains

24:24.120 --> 24:27.954
§ We will go home singing our song...

24:28.040 --> 24:30.270
(singing fades)

24:45.560 --> 24:49.348
§..hear our singing, hear our longing

24:49.440 --> 24:53.718
§ We will go home across the mountains

24:53.800 --> 24:58.157
§ We will go home
We will go home...

24:58.240 --> 25:00.435
(singing fades)

25:03.760 --> 25:05.352
Arthur!

25:05.560 --> 25:07.755
Arthur!

25:09.440 --> 25:13.228
Arthur! You're not
completely Roman yet, right?

25:13.320 --> 25:15.436
Rus!

25:19.240 --> 25:21.390
Knights...

25:21.480 --> 25:23.710
brothers in arms...

25:23.800 --> 25:25.756
your courage has been tested
beyond all limits.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.068
Yes.

25:27.160 --> 25:29.355
But I must ask you now for one further trial.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.112
Drink.

25:31.200 --> 25:37.196
We must leave on a final mission for Rome
before our freedom can be granted.

25:40.320 --> 25:44.313
Above the wall, far in the north,
there is a Roman family in need of rescue.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.470
They are trapped by Saxons.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.755
Our orders are to secure their safety.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.229
Let the Romans take care of their own.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.880
Above the wall is Woad territory.

25:54.520 --> 25:59.310
Our duty to Rome,
if it was ever a duty, is done.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.151
Our pact with Rome is done.

26:02.240 --> 26:06.916
Every knight here
has laid his life on the line for you.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.513
For you.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.558
And instead of freedom
you want more blood?

26:11.640 --> 26:13.835
Our blood?

26:13.920 --> 26:16.070
You think more of Roman blood
than you do of ours?

26:16.160 --> 26:17.878
Bors! These are our orders.

26:17.960 --> 26:21.635
We leave at first light, and when we return
your freedom will be waiting for you.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.392
A freedom we can embrace with honour.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.516
I am a free man!

26:25.600 --> 26:27.556
I will choose my own fate!

26:27.640 --> 26:30.279
Yeah, yeah.
We're all going to die someday.

26:30.360 --> 26:33.591
If it's a death from a Saxon hand
that frightens you, stay home.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.671
Listen, if you're so eager to die,
you can die right now!

26:35.760 --> 26:37.751
- Enough. Enough!
- I've got something to live for!

26:37.840 --> 26:40.559
The Romans have broken their word.

26:40.640 --> 26:44.155
We have the word of Arthur.
That is good enough.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.113
I'll prepare.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.077
Bors?

26:49.160 --> 26:51.276
- You coming?
- Of course I'm coming!

26:51.360 --> 26:54.432
Can't let you go on your own!
You'll all get killed!

26:55.160 --> 26:57.993
I'm just saying what you're all thinking!

26:59.280 --> 27:01.191
Vanora'll kill me.

27:03.320 --> 27:05.231
And you, Gawain?

27:09.480 --> 27:11.391
I'm with you.

27:13.080 --> 27:15.594
Galahad as well.

27:49.080 --> 27:53.073
O merciful God,
I have such need of your mercy now.

27:55.200 --> 27:58.317
Not for myself, but for my knights,

27:58.400 --> 28:00.630
for this is truly their hour of need.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.233
Deliver them from the trials ahead,

28:02.320 --> 28:06.438
and I will repay you a thousandfold
with any sacrifice you ask of me.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.916
And if, in your wisdom,

28:09.000 --> 28:12.356
you should determine that that sacrifice
must be my life for theirs,

28:12.440 --> 28:16.479
so they may once again taste the freedom
that has so long been denied to them,

28:16.560 --> 28:18.596
I will gladly make that covenant.

28:18.680 --> 28:22.389
My death will have a purpose.
I ask no more than that.

28:22.480 --> 28:25.438
Why do you always talk to God
and not to me?

28:25.520 --> 28:28.830
Oh, pray to whomever you pray
that we don't cross the Saxons.

28:28.920 --> 28:33.311
My faith is what protects me, Lancelot.
Why do you challenge this?

28:33.400 --> 28:35.630
I don't like anything
that puts a man on his knees.

28:35.720 --> 28:38.439
No man fears to kneel
before the god he trusts.

28:38.520 --> 28:40.988
Without faith, without belief in something,
what are we?

28:41.080 --> 28:43.514
To try and get past the Woads
in the north is insanity.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.433
- Them we've fought before.
- Not north of the wall!

28:48.920 --> 28:51.832
How many Saxons? Hm?

28:51.920 --> 28:53.956
How many?!

28:56.520 --> 28:59.159
Tell me. Do you believe in this mission?

28:59.240 --> 29:00.832
These people need our help.

29:00.920 --> 29:03.673
- It is our duty to bring them out.
- I don't care about your charge,

29:03.760 --> 29:07.799
and I don't give a damn about
Romans, Britain or this island.

29:08.280 --> 29:11.078
If you desire to spend eternity in this place,
Arthur, so be it,

29:11.160 --> 29:13.037
but suicide cannot be chosen for another!

29:13.120 --> 29:15.998
- And yet you choose death for this family!
- No, I choose life!

29:16.080 --> 29:18.674
And freedom for myself and the men!

29:25.760 --> 29:28.991
How many times in battle have we
snatched victory from the jaws of defeat?

29:29.080 --> 29:32.277
Outnumbered, outflanked,
yet still we triumph.

29:32.360 --> 29:35.989
With you at my side, we can do so again.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.836
Lancelot, we are knights.

29:38.920 --> 29:42.435
What other purpose do we serve
if not for such a cause?

29:42.520 --> 29:45.796
Arthur, you fight for a world
that will never exist.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.393
Never.

29:47.480 --> 29:50.199
There will always be a battlefield.

29:53.680 --> 29:55.352
I will die in battle.

29:55.440 --> 29:57.954
Of that I'm certain.

29:58.040 --> 30:01.112
And hopefully a battle of my choosing.

30:02.840 --> 30:05.673
But if it be this one,

30:05.760 --> 30:08.035
grant me a favour.

30:08.120 --> 30:11.032
Don't bury me in our sad little cemetery.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.473
Burn me.

30:12.560 --> 30:16.394
Burn me and cast my ashes
to a strong east wind.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.111
(woman screaming)

30:59.800 --> 31:02.030
Don't touch their women.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.909
We don't mix with these people.

31:11.760 --> 31:15.275
What kind of offspring
do you think that would yield?

31:15.360 --> 31:16.952
Weak people.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.951
Half people.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.950
I will not have our Saxon blood
watered down by mixing with them.

31:24.040 --> 31:28.556
According to our laws, no man
may deny me the spoils of our conquest!

31:28.640 --> 31:30.551
He speaks the truth, Father.

31:47.520 --> 31:50.557
My lord! O, my lord!

31:50.640 --> 31:52.676
God's thanks, my lord.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.318
Thank you.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.032
Thank you.

31:59.600 --> 32:00.919
Kill her.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.478
(wails)

32:03.880 --> 32:06.314
No! No!

32:06.400 --> 32:08.960
(softly) Are you challenging me?

32:10.280 --> 32:13.477
If you want to challenge me,
you have to have a sword in your hand.

32:13.880 --> 32:18.431
As long as my heart beats,
I rule and you hold your tongue.

32:19.680 --> 32:21.910
Or I'll cut it out.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.270
(neighing)

34:08.679 --> 34:11.989
We are three days' march from
the Great Wall, if we camp at night.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.275
We won't camp.

34:14.360 --> 34:17.033
The wall - what troops are stationed there?

34:17.120 --> 34:19.634
Light Roman infantry

34:19.719 --> 34:22.280
and possibly Sarmatian knights.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.952
Arthur Castus is their leader.

34:24.040 --> 34:26.235
Arthur? Who is this Arthur?

34:26.320 --> 34:31.155
It is said he has never been defeated
in battle. It is said he is a great warrior.

34:32.920 --> 34:34.831
Why should I trust you?

34:36.120 --> 34:38.190
You're a traitor to your own people.

34:38.280 --> 34:41.476
Tell my father of the Roman estate.

34:41.560 --> 34:43.471
Speak up!

34:44.560 --> 34:47.199
A very high-ranking family live there.

34:47.280 --> 34:50.078
They are of great importance to Rome.

34:50.159 --> 34:54.233
Father, their ransom
could pay for the entire campaign.

35:04.680 --> 35:07.069
I'll attack from the north
with the main army.

35:07.160 --> 35:11.551
You bring your men down here.
Cut off their retreat to the south.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.596
Burn every village, kill everybody.

35:15.400 --> 35:20.269
Never leave behind you a man, woman
or child who can ever carry a sword.

35:35.920 --> 35:37.592
Saxon.

35:37.960 --> 35:38.870
How many?

35:39.560 --> 35:40.993
Thousands.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.391
(horse whinnying)

35:56.360 --> 35:59.352
(Tristan) Woads. They're tracking us.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.191
(Arthur) Where?

36:02.280 --> 36:03.872
Everywhere.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.272
Yaah!

36:43.880 --> 36:45.359
Get back!

36:45.560 --> 36:47.391
Get back!

37:01.520 --> 37:02.953
This way!

37:11.000 --> 37:12.911
(war cries)

37:15.560 --> 37:17.278
Yaah!

37:44.560 --> 37:46.551
What are you waiting for?

38:05.120 --> 38:06.792
Inish.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.996
Devil ghosts.

38:09.080 --> 38:14.029
- Why would they not attack?
- Merlin doesn't want us dead.

38:17.280 --> 38:20.272
We should have killed them, Merlin.

38:21.040 --> 38:24.874
There might be a purpose
for Artorius and his Knights.

38:25.240 --> 38:25.877
No!

38:27.760 --> 38:29.193
He is our enemy!

38:32.280 --> 38:33.952
So is the Saxon!

38:34.040 --> 38:35.951
(clap of thunder)

38:37.160 --> 38:39.720
(Gawain groaning)

38:39.800 --> 38:43.236
Oh, I can't wait to leave this island.

38:43.320 --> 38:46.710
If it's not raining, it's snowing.
If it's not snowing, it's foggy.

38:46.800 --> 38:47.869
And that's the summer!

38:47.960 --> 38:51.919
The rain is good.
Washes all the blood away.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.036
Doesn't help the smell.

38:54.120 --> 38:58.750
Hey, Bors, do you intend to take Vanora
and all your little bastards back home?

38:58.840 --> 39:02.037
Oh, I'm trying to avoid that decision...

39:02.120 --> 39:04.031
by getting killed.

39:07.800 --> 39:11.315
Dagonet, she wants to get married
and give the children names.

39:11.400 --> 39:12.753
Women!

39:12.840 --> 39:15.149
The children already have names,
don't they?

39:15.240 --> 39:17.231
Just Gilly.

39:17.320 --> 39:20.710
It was too much trouble,
so we gave the rest of them numbers.

39:20.800 --> 39:23.678
That's interesting.
And I thought you couldn't count.

39:26.640 --> 39:29.871
You know, I never thought
I'd get back home alive.

39:29.960 --> 39:34.431
Now I've got the chance,
I... I don't want to leave my children.

39:34.520 --> 39:38.274
- You'd miss 'em too much.
- I'll take them with me.

39:38.360 --> 39:42.990
I like the little bastards.
They mean something to me.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.799
Especially number three.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.273
- He's a good fighter.
- That's because he's mine.

39:54.080 --> 39:55.593
I'm going for a piss.

39:55.680 --> 39:57.591
(laughter)

40:21.080 --> 40:23.116
- (guard) Who are you?
- I am Arthur Castus,

40:23.200 --> 40:26.795
Commander of the Sarmatian Knights,
sent by Bishop Germanius of Rome.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.950
Open the gate.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.949
(man) It is a wonder you have come.

40:39.040 --> 40:42.555
Good Jesus.
Arthur and his knights.

40:44.640 --> 40:47.234
You have fought the Woads.
Vile creatures.

40:47.320 --> 40:51.029
Our orders are to evacuate you
immediately.

40:51.120 --> 40:52.917
But that... that is impossible.

40:53.400 --> 40:56.710
- Which is Alecto?
- I am Alecto.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.955
Alecto is my son.

41:00.040 --> 41:04.318
And everything we have is here in the land
given to us by the Pope of Rome.

41:04.400 --> 41:09.997
- Well, you're about to give it to the Saxons.
- They're invading from the north.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.878
- Then Rome will send an army.
- They have. Us.

41:12.960 --> 41:15.872
- We leave as soon as you're packed.
- I refuse to leave.

41:20.880 --> 41:23.348
Go back to work! All of you!

41:23.440 --> 41:26.034
- You heard! Go!
- All right, all right.

41:26.680 --> 41:29.513
- Go!
- Get back to work, all of you!

41:29.880 --> 41:31.791
Go back!

41:34.080 --> 41:37.629
If I fail to bring you and your son back,
my men can never leave this land.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.233
So you're coming with me

41:39.320 --> 41:43.836
if I have to tie you to my horse and drag
you all the way to Hadrian's Wall myself.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.956
My lord.

41:46.040 --> 41:48.349
Lady, my knights are hungry.

41:51.080 --> 41:52.832
Go.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.319
Come!

42:03.680 --> 42:05.989
Come. Let us go, hm?

42:20.080 --> 42:23.231
(man) Sir, you're famous.
You're Arthur, aren't you?

42:23.320 --> 42:26.392
I'm Ganis. I'm a good fighter and I'm smart.
I'd serve you proudly.

42:27.640 --> 42:29.471
Are you from Rome?

42:29.560 --> 42:31.471
From hell.

42:32.800 --> 42:35.598
- Sir.
- Who is this man?

42:35.680 --> 42:38.274
He's our village elder.

42:38.360 --> 42:40.669
What is this punishment for?

42:40.760 --> 42:44.230
- Answer me!
- He defied our master, Marius.

42:44.760 --> 42:46.955
Most of the food we grow
is sent out by sea to be sold.

42:47.040 --> 42:49.759
He asked that we keep
a little more for ourselves, that's all.

42:49.840 --> 42:52.479
My arse has been snappin' at the grass
I'm so hungry!

42:52.560 --> 42:56.155
You're from Rome. Is it true
that Marius is a spokesman for God

42:56.240 --> 42:58.515
and that it's a sin to defy him?

43:02.040 --> 43:04.474
I tell you now.

43:04.560 --> 43:06.596
Marius is not of God.

43:06.680 --> 43:11.674
And you, all of you,
were free from your first breath!

43:20.120 --> 43:21.678
Help this man.

43:21.760 --> 43:24.149
Help him!

43:24.240 --> 43:28.199
Now hear me. A vast and terrible army
is coming this way.

43:28.280 --> 43:31.078
They will show no mercy, spare no one.

43:31.160 --> 43:33.151
Those of you who are able
should gather your things

43:33.240 --> 43:35.435
and begin to move south
towards Hadrian's Wall.

43:35.520 --> 43:37.954
Those unable shall come with us.

43:38.040 --> 43:40.679
You, serve me now.
Get these people ready.

43:40.760 --> 43:42.591
(Ganis) Right, you heard him.

43:42.680 --> 43:45.319
You go grab enough food and water
for the journey.

43:45.400 --> 43:46.992
Let's get a hurry on, else we're all dead!

43:52.840 --> 43:54.751
Come on, hurry.

43:58.040 --> 43:59.758
They have flanked us to the east.

43:59.840 --> 44:02.673
They're coming from the south,
trying to cut off our escape.

44:02.760 --> 44:04.193
They'll be here before nightfall.

44:04.280 --> 44:06.953
- How many?
- An entire army.

44:07.040 --> 44:09.031
And the only way out is to the south?

44:09.120 --> 44:10.473
East.

44:10.560 --> 44:13.950
There is a trail heading east
across the mountains.

44:14.520 --> 44:19.514
It means we have to cross behind Saxon
lines, but that's the one we should take.

44:20.400 --> 44:23.039
Arthur, who are all these people?

44:23.120 --> 44:25.031
They're coming with us.

44:26.840 --> 44:28.512
Then we'll never make it.

44:30.080 --> 44:31.911
(distant drums beating)

44:39.960 --> 44:41.871
- Come on, get back to work!
- Back to work!

44:52.920 --> 44:54.592
Move.

44:54.800 --> 44:56.631
Move.

44:58.120 --> 45:00.031
Move!

45:01.080 --> 45:03.719
- What is this?
- You cannot go in there.

45:03.800 --> 45:06.712
No one goes in there.
This place is forbidden.

45:08.200 --> 45:11.237
(Marius) What are you doing?
Stop this!

45:15.160 --> 45:16.559
Arthur, we have no time.

45:18.200 --> 45:20.760
Do you not hear the drums?

45:23.200 --> 45:25.111
Dagonet.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.158
Agh!

45:32.360 --> 45:34.271
Agh!

45:43.280 --> 45:46.033
- Key.
- It is locked.

45:46.120 --> 45:48.031
From the inside.

46:02.520 --> 46:04.909
- You, you... go.
- (whimpers)

46:05.000 --> 46:06.433
Move!

46:11.800 --> 46:15.759
- Gawain.
- (man chanting) Exaudi orationem meam.

46:17.280 --> 46:20.431
Exaudi orationem meam.

46:20.520 --> 46:26.470
In nomine Dei Patris omnipotentis
et in virtute Spiritus Sancti.

46:28.440 --> 46:31.159
Who are these defilers
of the Lord's temple?

46:31.240 --> 46:33.151
Out of the way.

46:51.120 --> 46:52.792
The work of your god.

46:53.920 --> 46:56.957
Is this how he answers your prayers?

46:57.040 --> 46:59.076
See if there's any still alive.

47:06.400 --> 47:09.517
How dare you set foot in this holy place?

47:12.920 --> 47:15.957
- There was a man of God.
- Not my god!

47:17.360 --> 47:20.557
- (Arthur) This one's dead.
- By this smell, they are all dead.

47:20.640 --> 47:23.757
And you.
You even move, you join him.

47:29.920 --> 47:31.194
Arthur!

47:35.600 --> 47:37.192
You must not fear me.

47:59.600 --> 48:01.989
Water! Give me some water!

48:30.800 --> 48:32.711
His arm is broken.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.911
And his family?

48:38.160 --> 48:40.071
She's a Woad.

48:42.320 --> 48:44.231
I'm a Roman officer.

48:45.120 --> 48:47.031
You're safe now.

48:48.240 --> 48:51.630
- You're safe.
- Stop what you are doing!

48:52.440 --> 48:53.634
What is this madness?

48:53.720 --> 48:56.473
- They're all pagans here!
- So are we.

48:56.560 --> 48:59.279
They refuse to do the task
God has set for them!

48:59.360 --> 49:00.952
They must die as an example!

49:01.040 --> 49:04.316
You mean they refused to be your serfs!

49:04.400 --> 49:06.118
You are a Roman.

49:06.200 --> 49:07.838
You understand.

49:07.920 --> 49:09.717
And you are a Christian.

49:09.800 --> 49:12.075
You! You kept her alive!

49:16.160 --> 49:18.549
- (soldier) My lord!
- No! No, stop!

49:20.400 --> 49:24.188
When we get to the wall
you will be punished for this heresy.

49:24.280 --> 49:27.829
Perhaps I should kill you now
and seal my fate.

49:27.920 --> 49:30.878
I was willing to die with them.

49:30.960 --> 49:34.111
Yes, to lead them to their rightful place.

49:34.200 --> 49:37.476
It is God's wish
that these sinners be sacrificed.

49:37.560 --> 49:40.074
Only then can their souls be saved.

49:40.680 --> 49:43.592
Then I shall grant his wish.

49:45.120 --> 49:47.953
- Wall them back up.
- Arthur.

49:48.520 --> 49:49.794
I said wall them up!

49:49.880 --> 49:53.759
Don't you see it is the will of God
that these sinners be sacrificed?

49:53.840 --> 49:58.311
- Unhand me, defil... They're sinners!
- Get in there!

50:34.680 --> 50:36.511
We're moving too slow.

50:36.600 --> 50:38.909
The girl's not gonna make it,
and neither is the boy.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.117
The family we can protect, but we're
wasting our time with all these people.

50:42.200 --> 50:44.111
We're not leaving them.

50:44.760 --> 50:47.149
If the Saxons find us, we will have to fight.

50:47.240 --> 50:49.629
Then save your anger for them.

50:50.800 --> 50:54.429
Is this Rome's quest or Arthur's?

51:14.160 --> 51:16.071
(weak moans)

51:19.400 --> 51:21.311
- Arthur.
- How is he?

51:22.240 --> 51:23.673
He burns.

51:25.080 --> 51:26.752
Brave boy.

52:03.040 --> 52:06.032
Some of your fingers are out of place.

52:06.120 --> 52:07.917
I have to push them back.

52:10.320 --> 52:14.791
If I don't do this, there's a chance
you may never use them again.

52:26.440 --> 52:28.237
- (cracking)
- (cries)

52:32.680 --> 52:34.591
(cracking)

52:46.040 --> 52:47.871
They tortured me.

52:49.400 --> 52:51.470
With machines.

52:57.240 --> 53:02.360
To make me tell them things that...
that I didn't know to begin with.

53:04.720 --> 53:06.631
And then...

53:09.920 --> 53:12.309
I heard your voice in the dark.

53:16.600 --> 53:19.194
I am Guinevere.

53:20.280 --> 53:22.430
You are Arthur...

53:23.440 --> 53:26.477
of the Knights from the Great Wall.

53:27.080 --> 53:28.718
I am.

53:29.480 --> 53:32.756
The famous Briton
who kills his own people.

53:57.200 --> 54:00.749
I found tracks coming from the south,
but none going back.

54:00.840 --> 54:03.752
Horsemen travelling light and fast.

54:03.840 --> 54:05.671
Could be Roman cavalry.

54:05.760 --> 54:07.193
Could be knights.

54:09.680 --> 54:11.636
They know we're after them.

54:12.640 --> 54:15.393
They'll head east now,
through the mountains.

54:15.480 --> 54:20.031
God's holy work has been defiled.
I am a servant of God!

54:20.120 --> 54:22.680
No, please, I... Agh!

54:23.800 --> 54:27.793
He says they walled him up in a building
and took the family.

54:28.400 --> 54:31.870
Someone who goes
by the name of Artorius.

54:31.960 --> 54:33.552
It's him.

54:33.640 --> 54:36.074
It's Arthur.

54:36.160 --> 54:38.720
Take your men east. Hunt them down.

54:39.400 --> 54:43.279
I'll take the main army to the wall.
Bring the family there.

54:43.360 --> 54:46.875
- (man) And the monks?
- Put them back where you found them.

54:46.960 --> 54:49.076
I am a servant of God!

54:49.160 --> 54:52.232
Please, I... I am a servant of God!

54:53.840 --> 54:56.718
(monk) Unhand me, you defiler!

54:58.480 --> 55:00.198
(sighs)

55:00.280 --> 55:01.235
Burn it all.

55:31.360 --> 55:32.952
Yah!

55:44.480 --> 55:47.278
My father told me great tales of you.

55:47.360 --> 55:48.793
Really?

55:48.880 --> 55:50.791
And what did you hear?

55:51.920 --> 55:53.831
Fairy tales.

55:54.800 --> 56:00.432
The kind you hear about people so brave,
so selfless, that they can't be real.

56:00.520 --> 56:02.670
Arthur and his knights.

56:02.760 --> 56:05.672
A leader both Briton and Roman.

56:06.840 --> 56:10.037
And yet you chose your allegiance
to Rome.

56:10.960 --> 56:13.758
To those who take
what does not belong to them.

56:13.840 --> 56:16.673
That same Rome that took your men
from their homeland.

56:16.760 --> 56:21.436
Listen, lady, do not pretend
you know anything about me or my men.

56:21.520 --> 56:22.873
How many Britons have you killed?

56:22.960 --> 56:25.633
As many as tried to kill me. It's the natural
state of any man to want to live.

56:25.720 --> 56:31.397
Animals live! It's a natural state of any man
to want to live free in their own country.

56:35.400 --> 56:37.960
I belong to this land.

56:38.040 --> 56:40.315
Where do you belong, Arthur?

56:46.120 --> 56:47.394
How's your hand?

56:50.160 --> 56:52.720
I'll live, I promise you.

56:57.600 --> 57:01.752
Is there nothing about my land
that appeals to your heart?

57:01.840 --> 57:03.956
Your own father married a Briton.

57:04.040 --> 57:07.112
Even he must have found something
to his liking.

57:12.600 --> 57:14.511
(gallops away)

57:22.640 --> 57:26.076
We'll sleep here.
Take shelter in those trees.

57:26.160 --> 57:29.550
- Tristan.
- You wanna go out again? Yeah.

58:02.760 --> 58:07.197
It is here, given to us by the Pope.
These people, they send an army for us.

58:45.600 --> 58:47.556
(rustling)

59:27.640 --> 59:29.312
(footsteps)

59:33.480 --> 59:34.959
You betrayed me.

59:35.040 --> 59:36.837
He means you no harm.

59:36.920 --> 59:40.435
Peace between us this night,
Arthur Castus.

59:45.040 --> 59:48.510
So Rome is leaving. The Saxon is come.

59:48.600 --> 59:52.752
The world we have known
and fought for is ended.

59:52.840 --> 59:54.558
Now we must make a new world.

59:54.640 --> 59:57.552
Your world, Merlin, not mine.
I shall be in Rome.

59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.029
To find peace?
The Saxon will come to Rome.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.350
My knights trust me
not to betray them to their enemy.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:05.876
Rome was my enemy, not Arthur.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.632
We have no fight between us now.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.950
You tell that to the knights
you killed before my eyes,

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.678
whose bones are buried in this earth.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.159
We have all lost brothers.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:16.038
You know nothing of the loss I speak!

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.872
Shall I help you remember?

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.873
An attack on a village.
The screams of an innocent woman.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.197
Mother!

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.191
Artorius!

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.431
Mother!

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.551
Mother!

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:47.599
I ran to the burial mound
of my father to free her.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.430
To kill you.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.594
Father, please let loose your sword.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.031
I feel the heat of that fire
on my face even now.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.278
I did not wish her dead.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:26.239
She was of our blood, as are you.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:31.553
If you were so determined to leave us
to slaughter, why did you save so many?

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.309
My men are strong,
but they have need of a true leader.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.550
They believe you can do anything.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.879
To defeat the Saxon
we need a master of war.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.952
Why do you think
I spared you in the forest?

01:01:54.520 --> 01:02:00.629
That sword you carry is made of iron
from this earth, forged in the fires of Britain.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:05.475
It was love of your mother
that freed the sword, not hatred of me.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.471
Love, Arthur.

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.992
Seize him!

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.231
No!

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.951
No...

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.390
