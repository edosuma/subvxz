WEBVTT

00:52.802 --> 00:55.597
FINALE

01:08.943 --> 01:09.986
You're here.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.329
Pay your respects first.

02:40.618 --> 02:41.995
What are all these photos?

02:44.747 --> 02:46.124
A while back,

02:46.875 --> 02:49.752
Ms. Gam-ri saw a table of photos
at our neighbor's son's wedding

02:50.336 --> 02:51.504
and said to me

02:53.006 --> 02:55.884
that she'd like something similar

02:55.967 --> 02:58.136
at her own funeral.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.097
So I asked her what she meant by it,

03:02.181 --> 03:05.435
and she said
that the next biggest event she'd throw

03:05.518 --> 03:06.936
would be her funeral.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.900
She said she'd want nothing more
than for the guests

03:12.609 --> 03:14.527
to laugh and have a good time.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.489
That she'll have gone to the good place,

03:19.532 --> 03:21.492
so we should grill potato <i>jeon</i>

03:22.702 --> 03:24.454
and chug down <i>makgeolli</i>.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.293
That's why…

03:31.878 --> 03:34.172
we're respecting her final wishes.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.800
-Right?
-Don't be ridiculous!

03:37.884 --> 03:39.761
You know I don't drink a lot.

03:39.844 --> 03:40.845
As if.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.597
Go ahead.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.307
Aren't you going to help?

03:44.390 --> 03:45.475
It tastes great.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.977
-Try some.
-Goodness.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.355
-Really?
-Thank you.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.357
-Thank you.
-Let's call Du-sik over.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.942
No way. I don't want to.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.194
-Dr. Yoon, over here.
-Eat your food.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.612
Okay.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.489
Go ahead. They're waiting for you.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.075
Want a bowl of <i>yukgaejang</i>?

04:03.284 --> 04:05.245
Right. You wouldn't want any.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.705
I will. I want a bowl.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.334
Fill it to the brim.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.295
Sure.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.005
Take a look.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.507
-Hey!
-Goodness. Hello.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.342
-Director Ji!
-Welcome.

04:19.425 --> 04:22.220
-Hello.
-Gosh, you came.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.306
-Hye-jin.
-Seong-hyeon.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.224
Chief Hong.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.768
I'm so sorry.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.605
You'll have some <i>yukgaejang</i>, right?

04:39.153 --> 04:42.365
-What do you mean?
-Are you kidding me?

04:42.448 --> 04:45.034
-Hwa-jeong, come here.
-I thought we were done!

04:45.118 --> 04:47.161
-Gosh.
-Let me introduce you to someone.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.539
-Hold on.
-Bo-ra, where are you?

04:49.622 --> 04:52.333
I've always been like that though.

04:52.417 --> 04:55.712
-Could I join you guys?
-Please have a seat.

04:55.795 --> 04:56.879
You've come a long way.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.548
Gosh, look who it is!

04:58.631 --> 05:01.050
-What took you so long?
-Seriously?

05:01.134 --> 05:04.721
REST IN PEACE

05:08.641 --> 05:10.143
Thank you for coming.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.562
Of course we should.

05:13.062 --> 05:16.232
I was worried about you,
but I'm glad you seem to be doing okay.

05:16.316 --> 05:20.278
Yes. It'll be a long drive,
so get on your way. You too, Ms. Wang.

05:20.361 --> 05:24.574
I'm sure Ms. Gam-ri went to a good place.

05:24.657 --> 05:25.992
She was such a good person.

05:26.826 --> 05:27.827
Thank you.

05:28.786 --> 05:31.497
Have a safe trip back.
Seong-hyeon, drive safely.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.750
Sure. We'll get going then.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.377
-Drive safely.
-Take care.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.851
Let me walk you home.

05:52.643 --> 05:55.354
Don't bother.
I'm staying with you tonight.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.690
But it'll be uncomfortable there.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.109
Sleep in your own bed
and come early in the morning.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.112
-Will you be all right?
-What?

06:03.196 --> 06:04.614
It seems to me

06:05.490 --> 06:07.325
you're pretending to be okay.

06:07.909 --> 06:08.868
I'm not sure.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.622
I guess it hasn't sunk in yet.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.793
This is not my first time,

06:17.335 --> 06:19.462
but I can never get used to it.

06:20.671 --> 06:24.592
I still remember Ms. Gam-ri's face
from when she sat on her wooden porch.

06:24.675 --> 06:29.639
I can still hear her
calling me from the alleyway.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.351
It feels like she's still here with me.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.105
So I don't…

06:38.856 --> 06:40.316
want to let her go yet.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.950
Just for a little while longer,
I want her by my side.

07:37.748 --> 07:38.583
Du-sik,

07:42.003 --> 07:43.129
I…

07:45.256 --> 07:46.591
can't quite…

07:48.342 --> 07:50.011
picture my mother's face.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.600
I've been staring at her photo all day,

07:57.435 --> 07:59.437
but she looks strange to me.

08:00.771 --> 08:02.356
My mother…

08:02.440 --> 08:04.984
How did my mom seem to you?

08:07.111 --> 08:08.488
Was she well?

08:09.071 --> 08:09.906
Yes.

08:11.199 --> 08:15.536
She laughed a lot, had fun here and there,

08:17.121 --> 08:20.416
and helped others out. She seemed happy.

08:20.958 --> 08:23.711
She was the same old Ms. Gam-ri.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.049
I thought…

08:33.304 --> 08:34.472
that my mom…

08:35.932 --> 08:38.184
would stay in my life for a long time.

08:39.477 --> 08:43.981
So I kept putting off seeing her because
I thought there'd be plenty of chances.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.693
But there aren't any left now.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.907
When parents pass away,

08:54.116 --> 08:56.786
children who regret the most cry the most.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.873
But I'm too ashamed…

09:02.083 --> 09:03.209
to even cry.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.339
It's not like implants cost a fortune,

09:11.259 --> 09:14.303
but I never even got around
to taking her to the dentist.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.350
She got her implants.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.563
The procedure went well,

09:24.564 --> 09:28.442
so she enjoyed meat and squid
as much as she wanted.

09:35.032 --> 09:37.451
Jeez, I'm such an idiot.

09:39.870 --> 09:42.081
Yet, I had my own kid study abroad.

09:44.917 --> 09:48.379
My mom probably put me first
like I prioritize my children…

09:53.676 --> 09:55.428
since I'm her son.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.807
I'm such an idiot.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.313
I don't know what to do about this guilt.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.191
I can't even say sorry anymore.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.529
I can't be a good son to her anymore.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.491
How can I possibly…

10:19.744 --> 10:21.078
carry on with my life?

10:21.662 --> 10:24.123
Won-seok, don't be like that.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.709
Ms. Gam-ri would've
never thought that way.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.422
To her, you were…

10:32.715 --> 10:36.969
a good son who never got into any trouble.

10:38.971 --> 10:43.351
You were her proud son
who worked as an accountant in Seoul.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.604
You were her joy.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.776
You made her happy and gave her comfort.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.447
You were the reason she lived.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.038
Mom…

11:06.874 --> 11:09.877
Mom!

11:14.048 --> 11:16.258
Mom…

11:20.763 --> 11:23.391
Mom…

11:26.852 --> 11:28.854
Mom…

11:34.360 --> 11:36.404
Mom…

13:38.692 --> 13:42.947
Won-seok said he would not
sell the house and keep it as is.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.990
Really?

13:45.074 --> 13:47.785
It's his childhood home, after all.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.620
He said he'd come by at times.

13:49.703 --> 13:52.122
I should come around often then.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.709
For some reason,
empty homes tend to deteriorate faster.

13:55.793 --> 13:56.710
You're right.

13:58.295 --> 14:01.298
You think she's on the other side by now?

14:01.382 --> 14:06.512
Probably. I bet she's the prettiest
among everyone there.

14:07.596 --> 14:11.600
Thanks to Dr. Yoon, she was able
to enjoy squid before passing away.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.477
Absolutely.

14:14.061 --> 14:17.398
Mat-i, promise me
that you'll live for many years to come.

14:17.481 --> 14:19.817
I'll be too bored without you.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.778
Wouldn't life be better
since I scold you all the time?

14:23.487 --> 14:24.989
Scold me all you want.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.575
Order me around and make fun of me.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.578
Just make sure you stay around longer.

14:31.954 --> 14:32.955
All right.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.667
You must. Promise me.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.129
I said I would.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.321
I made too much.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.038
Chief Hong.

15:15.080 --> 15:15.956
Hey.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.836
What is all that? Soap?

15:20.920 --> 15:24.840
Yes. Do you want some?
I added a lot of tangerine peels.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.342
Sounds good to me.

15:27.217 --> 15:28.052
Have you eaten?

15:29.678 --> 15:30.679
Not yet.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.514
Why not?

15:33.307 --> 15:35.392
Come on. I'll treat you to something good.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.645
Why bother? Come inside.
I'll cook something up.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.812
Then I'll cook.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.946
This time,

15:47.780 --> 15:50.157
I memorized the whole recipe.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.618
It'll be good, so just wait a bit.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.676
I see you still have these.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.263
They're all dry now, aren't they?

16:13.847 --> 16:15.057
I couldn't throw them out.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.103
For some reason, I couldn't touch them.

16:35.661 --> 16:36.704
You know,

16:39.331 --> 16:41.709
they say when you lose a loved one,

16:42.751 --> 16:44.253
you should mourn plenty.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.423
If not,

16:48.590 --> 16:52.636
Or else, the grief travels
all through your body,

16:54.304 --> 16:55.973
and it bursts later.

16:59.059 --> 17:02.021
FOR DU-SIK

17:19.788 --> 17:22.750
<i>Du-sik, you should eat.</i>

17:23.667 --> 17:28.338
<i>No matter how hard life gets,
one should still eat.</i>

17:30.340 --> 17:35.679
<i>Ever since you were a child,
you've been living with a broken heart,</i>

17:36.638 --> 17:40.392
<i>and the only thing I could do for you
was cook you food.</i>

17:41.143 --> 17:45.856
<i>You ate the food I made and grew so tall.</i>

17:45.939 --> 17:49.234
<i>You have no idea how proud I was of you.</i>

17:52.196 --> 17:56.325
<i>Du-sik, do you remember
what you said to me?</i>

17:57.159 --> 18:00.579
<i>You said that the best thing
a parent can do for their child</i>

18:00.662 --> 18:02.414
<i>is staying healthy.</i>

18:03.123 --> 18:05.667
<i>It's the same with parents.</i>

18:06.502 --> 18:09.421
<i>It tears our hearts out
when our children are in pain.</i>

18:12.508 --> 18:17.096
<i>Du-sik, you are my son
and also my grandson.</i>

18:18.013 --> 18:21.058
<i>Don't you ever forget that.</i>

18:23.977 --> 18:29.525
<i>Du-sik, people should live
among other people.</i>

18:30.526 --> 18:33.237
<i>Life may seem
like a burden to you at times,</i>

18:34.321 --> 18:38.492
<i>but if you choose to be among others,</i>

18:38.575 --> 18:40.911
<i>just like you did for me,</i>

18:40.994 --> 18:43.163
<i>someone will carry you on their back.</i>

18:44.456 --> 18:48.460
<i>So Du-sik,
stop locking yourself up in your house,</i>

18:49.169 --> 18:53.674
<i>eat the food I made,
and come out to see us.</i>

19:00.180 --> 19:02.391
Doesn't she have the neatest handwriting?

19:05.227 --> 19:08.272
Yes, it's very neat.

19:08.856 --> 19:13.277
I once asked her…

19:15.612 --> 19:17.573
why she never accepted my money.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.159
and if it's because I wasn't family.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.414
But she called me her son.

19:27.791 --> 19:28.792
And also her grandson.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.586
It's true.

20:04.536 --> 20:09.166
<i>That day, we said
our belated farewell to Ms. Gam-ri.</i>

20:10.375 --> 20:13.462
<i>Despite so many losses
he's experienced in his life,</i>

20:13.545 --> 20:15.631
<i>he's always kept his sorrow bottled up.</i>

20:16.298 --> 20:19.426
<i>Not even once has he been
able to fully mourn or grieve.</i>

20:19.968 --> 20:22.429
<i>For the first time, he cried his eyes out.</i>

20:26.767 --> 20:30.771
<i>And the others, too, mourned Ms. Gam-ri</i>

20:30.854 --> 20:32.731
<i>in their own ways.</i>

20:35.108 --> 20:36.818
She left this behind.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.959
GONGJIN KOREAN-CHINESE RESTAURANT

20:58.131 --> 21:00.384
BORA SUPERMARKET

21:40.048 --> 21:41.842
<i>And so we were able to learn</i>

21:42.968 --> 21:45.095
<i>that as long as we have memories of them,</i>

21:45.178 --> 21:49.016
<i>our loved ones are always with us.</i>

22:17.336 --> 22:20.630
ONE MONTH LATER

22:29.598 --> 22:32.434
Ms. Wang, your hair is slick

22:32.517 --> 22:34.561
as if you applied camellia oil.

22:35.395 --> 22:36.396
Thanks.

22:37.439 --> 22:40.025
You can also open
an oil shop with your hair.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.026
It's that greasy.

22:42.819 --> 22:45.989
We're done. We finally finished
editing the last episode!

22:46.073 --> 22:47.115
Good job.

22:49.242 --> 22:50.452
Let's applaud.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.164
Thank you all for the hard work.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.876
We should really shower on press day.

22:57.959 --> 23:00.670
Right. We should
really go home for a change.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.174
Another gastric pain?

23:04.257 --> 23:07.427
-Yes, I must've been stressed out.
-I'll take you to the hospital.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.763
No, it's not anything new.
It'll soon get better.

23:10.347 --> 23:12.474
Do-ha, can you get her some warm water?

23:12.557 --> 23:13.642
-Sure.
-Thanks.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.356
At least rest at the lounge. Get up.

23:20.482 --> 23:21.483
Come on.

23:29.032 --> 23:31.368
There it is.

23:32.369 --> 23:33.620
Here.

23:33.703 --> 23:37.499
FAST-ACTING MEDICINE

23:38.959 --> 23:39.960
This…

23:40.043 --> 23:43.964
I figured you've run of this by now,
so I bought one in advance.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.423
Take that for now.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.802
Wait. I also should have…

23:51.221 --> 23:52.097
Found it.

23:52.764 --> 23:56.768
Jeez. Why do you have a heat pack
when summer only just ended?

23:56.852 --> 23:59.354
Probably for this kind of occasion.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.691
Here. Put it on your stomach.

24:07.237 --> 24:10.073
Did you get a checkup?
An endoscopy too, right?

24:10.157 --> 24:13.451
Yes, they said I was fine.
It's just the stress.

24:13.535 --> 24:16.705
Let's stay away from spicy <i>tteokbokki</i>
for late-night snacks.

24:17.247 --> 24:19.583
I'll get you some cabbage juice as well.

24:19.666 --> 24:21.251
It does taste foul, but--

24:21.334 --> 24:22.335
Director Ji.

24:23.044 --> 24:24.421
Can you please…

24:25.589 --> 24:27.632
stop being so nice to me?

24:31.136 --> 24:32.679
You must know this by now,

24:33.847 --> 24:35.473
but I have feelings for you.

24:37.767 --> 24:39.519
I'm aware that you look out for me

24:40.270 --> 24:42.147
and know everything about me

24:43.899 --> 24:46.818
only because we've been
working together for so long.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.654
It's like a habit now.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.948
-Ji-won--
-But,

24:53.533 --> 24:54.868
whenever you're like this,

24:56.870 --> 24:59.080
I keep getting my hopes up.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.795
It's why I can't work with you anymore.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.614
Are you done packing?

25:33.740 --> 25:35.033
I'm just getting started.

25:35.742 --> 25:37.160
There's a lot to pack.

25:38.119 --> 25:39.371
Thanks, Chief Hong.

25:39.871 --> 25:42.499
Thank you for understanding.

25:44.334 --> 25:46.962
It's a good opportunity, so you should go.

25:54.010 --> 25:57.639
One might think that
you're moving to Seoul for good.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.725
Hye-jin, why are you packing so much

26:00.809 --> 26:03.270
for a three-day seminar?

26:08.525 --> 26:13.113
Actually, I was offered
a clinical professor job.

26:14.948 --> 26:16.283
In Seoul, I suppose.

26:17.909 --> 26:18.743
Yes.

26:24.457 --> 26:25.583
It's a good opportunity.

26:27.877 --> 26:29.087
A very good one.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.507
You always wanted to move back there.

26:33.883 --> 26:35.176
I did.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.638
Then, you should go…

26:40.807 --> 26:42.392
since it's what you want.

26:45.520 --> 26:49.024
You're quite dense, aren't you?

26:50.400 --> 26:51.276
What?

26:51.359 --> 26:53.862
"I did" as in past tense.

26:53.945 --> 26:57.574
Do I have to rephrase it
in present or future tense for you?

26:58.283 --> 27:00.118
I don't want to go to Seoul.

27:00.201 --> 27:03.121
I'm staying right here.
I'm not going to Seoul.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.456
Is it because of me?

27:05.040 --> 27:06.541
What? Gosh.

27:06.624 --> 27:08.960
Do you think of me as the submissive type?

27:09.044 --> 27:13.298
I made this decision of my own free will.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.926
There are a lot of things
I need to do here.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.221
Cleaning the neighborhood,

27:20.764 --> 27:23.058
visiting Seumseum at I-jun's,

27:23.808 --> 27:27.145
and talking about DOS with Ju-ri.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.648
Most importantly though,

27:31.358 --> 27:35.320
I'm the one and only dentist Gongjin has.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.282
And last but not least,

27:41.159 --> 27:42.869
because you're here.

27:44.996 --> 27:46.206
Thanks.

27:46.915 --> 27:48.208
Thank you, Hye-jin.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.794
I like this place too.

27:51.628 --> 27:52.879
As much as you do.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.718
I'm in love with Gongjin now.

28:05.433 --> 28:08.061
Why not call a moving company?

28:08.144 --> 28:10.313
Have professionals pack your bags for you.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.401
Am I packing too much?

28:14.484 --> 28:16.778
No, you can change 15 times a day.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.655
Exactly. And it's doable for me.

28:18.738 --> 28:19.656
It sure is.

28:21.282 --> 28:23.493
-Good luck.
-I'll be back before you know it.

28:23.576 --> 28:26.162
-Can you help me?
-This one still has its tag.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.081
-Right.
-They must all be new.

28:28.164 --> 28:30.542
Of course not. Not all of them.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.045
What?

28:38.049 --> 28:39.300
What are you looking for?

28:39.384 --> 28:41.094
Yes, my lottery ticket.

28:41.177 --> 28:43.888
I forgot to compare the numbers yesterday.

28:44.889 --> 28:47.684
You really like
playing the lottery, don't you?

28:49.060 --> 28:52.856
It's like a breath of fresh air
in this suffocating life of mine.

28:54.524 --> 28:57.736
Can you look up
this week's winning numbers?

28:57.819 --> 29:00.947
Sorry? Okay, just a second.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.490
Here. Found it.

29:04.617 --> 29:06.995
All right. Here you go.

29:07.078 --> 29:09.038
Okay, let's see.

29:12.167 --> 29:13.460
Six. Nice!

29:14.627 --> 29:15.545
Eight.

29:17.338 --> 29:18.173
Nine.

29:19.716 --> 29:20.967
Twenty-four.

29:24.304 --> 29:26.222
Thirty-six.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.949
-Eun-cheol!
-Hold on.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.786
We're good. We're all good now.

29:47.869 --> 29:50.830
Our life is set.
We're settled for a lifetime.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.290
My gosh!

29:56.753 --> 29:59.464
-I can't believe it!
-Mi-seon--

29:59.547 --> 30:03.593
-Is this really happening?
-These aren't right.

30:03.676 --> 30:05.011
-It's…
-What do you mean?

30:05.094 --> 30:06.596
They're not this week's numbers.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.264
How can that be?

30:08.348 --> 30:09.557
Well, I…

30:10.391 --> 30:13.520
I think I showed you
last week's winning numbers.

30:13.603 --> 30:14.979
WEEK 987

30:15.063 --> 30:16.189
WEEK 988

30:24.489 --> 30:25.573
Mi-seon.

30:28.868 --> 30:30.078
I'm sorry.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.042
Are you upset?

30:37.544 --> 30:38.545
No.

30:40.129 --> 30:42.215
I just feel like I lost my whole world.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.718
My hopes and dreams are in shreds.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.304
And I shaved years off my lifespan.

30:49.097 --> 30:52.100
If you had really won the lottery,

30:52.600 --> 30:54.102
what did you want to do?

30:56.604 --> 30:58.231
I wanted to buy a house, of course.

30:59.941 --> 31:02.694
A house that we could live in someday.

31:06.322 --> 31:07.365
Mi-seon!

31:09.117 --> 31:10.869
Follow me. We have someplace to go.

31:13.079 --> 31:15.415
What do you think of this place?

31:15.498 --> 31:16.499
What do you mean?

31:18.334 --> 31:22.213
Would it be a nice spot for a house?

31:24.841 --> 31:26.968
Of course, it would be nice.

31:28.553 --> 31:31.973
However, my bank account says
it's pie in the sky.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.558
Well…

31:37.312 --> 31:39.022
BALANCE

31:39.105 --> 31:42.358
Am I seeing things?
Why are there so many zeroes?

31:42.942 --> 31:44.110
That's what I have left

31:44.193 --> 31:48.072
from 1.4 billion won
after 33 percent in public charge and tax.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.076
It was me.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.704
The third mystery of Gongjin.

31:56.247 --> 31:57.624
The lottery winner.

31:59.042 --> 32:02.629
Hey, Eun-cheol.
I'm sorry. You must be busy studying.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.422
The road hasn't been fixed, has it?

32:04.505 --> 32:07.508
No, and it's still windy outside.
Is something up though?

32:07.592 --> 32:10.929
Bo-ra hit I-jun again.
Can you believe her?

32:11.012 --> 32:14.140
Can you close up the store
in about ten minutes?

32:14.223 --> 32:15.934
Sure. Don't worry and take your time.

32:16.017 --> 32:18.019
-Got it.
-Have a good one.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.827
<i>I mean, a ticket suddenly caught my eye,</i>

32:34.911 --> 32:36.996
<i>so I tried it for the first time.</i>

32:37.705 --> 32:39.666
<i>And I ended up winning.</i>

32:40.959 --> 32:42.418
But I never told anyone.

32:45.838 --> 32:50.426
What's with all these withdrawals,
by the way? This is a lot.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.428
I made donations.

32:53.930 --> 32:55.932
-What?
-Back then,

32:56.015 --> 32:59.143
I had been studying
to join the police academy for years.

32:59.227 --> 33:02.438
But all this money

33:02.522 --> 33:04.774
distracted me from my studies.

33:04.857 --> 33:06.776
So I asked myself this.

33:06.859 --> 33:10.989
"Choi Eun-cheol, what is it
that you really want to be?

33:11.572 --> 33:13.491
Someone rich or a police officer?"

33:16.369 --> 33:17.704
And it was a police officer.

33:19.622 --> 33:22.458
And I wanted to be a police officer…

33:23.835 --> 33:24.961
because

33:26.295 --> 33:29.090
I wanted to make the world a better place.

33:29.882 --> 33:32.301
And donating has the same purpose,

33:32.385 --> 33:35.221
so I decided to contribute a little.

33:35.304 --> 33:39.392
Eun-cheol, you really are too much,
you know that?

33:41.269 --> 33:42.186
Sorry?

33:46.232 --> 33:48.192
How can you be so cool?

33:48.276 --> 33:50.820
How can a person be this perfect?

33:50.903 --> 33:52.655
You're a diamond in the rough,

33:52.739 --> 33:57.452
and I praise my own eyes
for actually discovering you.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.538
Aren't you disappointed?

34:00.621 --> 34:03.583
Well, truth be told,

34:03.666 --> 34:08.880
for about three seconds,
I did think it was a pity a tiny bit.

34:09.922 --> 34:14.719
But no. I'm never going
to besmirch your good deeds.

34:14.802 --> 34:19.682
Besides, a man diligent enough to
get a job after winning the lottery

34:19.766 --> 34:21.559
could do just about anything.

34:22.143 --> 34:24.437
A house? We can build one if we decide to.

34:24.520 --> 34:28.316
We can bring bricks here
and build it from the ground up ourselves.

34:28.399 --> 34:31.694
Mi-seon, can you turn over the page?

34:33.696 --> 34:34.864
You have some left.

34:41.537 --> 34:46.667
A picturesque house up on that green hill.

34:48.377 --> 34:49.712
What would you say to that?

34:52.757 --> 34:54.884
With the man I love,

34:56.469 --> 34:58.805
I'd spend a hundred years there.

35:02.433 --> 35:04.852
-Eun-cheol.
-Yes?

35:04.936 --> 35:06.354
I couldn't be happier.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.583
Why are you groaning?

35:28.167 --> 35:31.838
Seriously. I wish I didn't have to go.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.466
Maybe it's not too late to cancel.

35:36.634 --> 35:39.220
How can the presenter
not attend the seminar?

35:39.303 --> 35:40.346
Still.

35:40.429 --> 35:41.305
How can I manage

35:41.389 --> 35:44.016
-without seeing you for days?
-Gosh.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.228
I don't think I can.
Come to Seoul with me.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.522
I'm afraid I can't
due to my busy schedule.

35:49.605 --> 35:50.982
What do you have lined up?

35:51.065 --> 35:52.441
Let's see.

35:52.525 --> 35:56.529
I need to deliver anchovies, fix the nets,
and play with the chief's dog.

35:56.612 --> 35:58.197
Bugyeong, right?

35:58.865 --> 36:01.617
What? Are you saying they come before me?

36:01.701 --> 36:05.955
Of course not. If I could,
I'd carry you around in my pocket.

36:06.038 --> 36:07.582
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

36:07.665 --> 36:09.041
I'd carry you in my suitcase.

36:09.125 --> 36:10.459
-In your suitcase?
-Yes.

36:10.543 --> 36:14.088
Get in my bag right now.
I'm going to run off with you.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.756
-Should I?
-Is it too big for you?

36:15.840 --> 36:17.341
No, it's the perfect size.

36:17.425 --> 36:18.926
-The perfect size?
-I'm going in.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.179
-I'm getting sick of this, you know.
-I mean it.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.181
What do we do?

36:23.264 --> 36:26.267
What am I going to do with you, Du-sik?

36:27.018 --> 36:30.438
I feel a little under the weather.
Let's go to a sauna together.

36:30.521 --> 36:32.690
I got a body scrub last week,
so go on your own.

36:32.773 --> 36:34.483
It's already been a week.

36:34.567 --> 36:37.028
Come on, let's go.
I'll treat you to <i>sikhye</i>.

36:37.111 --> 36:38.321
You're offering to buy?

36:38.404 --> 36:41.032
When have I never?
The offer stands just for you.

36:41.115 --> 36:42.909
Scrubbing too often isn't good for you.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.577
Come on. Let's go.

36:44.660 --> 36:45.745
Hwa-jeong.

36:47.872 --> 36:51.000
What the hell? Did you have plans?

36:51.083 --> 36:53.544
No, I stopped by
after hearing she was here.

36:53.628 --> 36:57.465
I see. Well, you two better
not have fun without me. Okay?

36:58.174 --> 36:59.842
Can you stop being so clingy?

37:02.511 --> 37:05.181
Hold on. Did you get a new phone?

37:05.765 --> 37:06.724
Hello?

37:07.308 --> 37:08.768
Right now? Got it.

37:09.894 --> 37:11.020
Stay if you want.

37:11.103 --> 37:12.146
Where are you off to?

37:12.230 --> 37:14.815
-Yeong-guk wants to see me.
-What the…

37:14.899 --> 37:16.317
Goodness.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.902
Hwa-jeong, enjoy your date!

37:17.985 --> 37:20.821
Goodness. Look at her run.

37:20.905 --> 37:23.658
Be grateful to the one
who brought you two back together!

37:29.247 --> 37:30.456
Gosh, hello.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.460
Why did you ask me to come?

37:34.543 --> 37:38.381
Because I wanted
to make something official.

37:39.131 --> 37:40.216
Where do I work?

37:40.299 --> 37:41.968
Is this a quiz? The town hall.

37:42.051 --> 37:44.220
The name was changed ages ago.

37:44.303 --> 37:46.472
It's now
the Administration and Welfare Center.

37:46.555 --> 37:49.267
But I barely got used to Town Hall.

37:49.350 --> 37:50.768
The new name's too long.

37:50.851 --> 37:53.354
Then call it the AW Center for short.

37:54.063 --> 37:57.733
Anyway, my official place of work is now
the Administration and Welfare Center,

37:57.817 --> 38:01.779
and I also wish to be
your personal AW Center too.

38:04.282 --> 38:07.660
I will be open 24/7
to answer your requests and complaints.

38:07.743 --> 38:09.578
Look forward to timely solutions.

38:12.039 --> 38:14.250
Are you sure you can
handle the complaints?

38:14.333 --> 38:15.334
I'll be fine.

38:16.711 --> 38:17.628
Bring it on.

38:17.712 --> 38:20.715
Take a look around.
We're even giving out gifts.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.967
No, wait. I'll bring it to you instead.

38:23.592 --> 38:25.344
A gift? What would that be?

38:32.852 --> 38:33.853
What's this?

38:34.478 --> 38:38.316
Can't you see?
It's the same tonic you got me.

38:38.399 --> 38:39.525
You call this a gift?

38:39.608 --> 38:42.737
I know that it's not a fancy gift,

38:42.820 --> 38:46.157
but all I could think of
was something for your health.

38:47.533 --> 38:49.410
We're halfway through our lives,

38:49.493 --> 38:52.788
so let's drink this and
travel until we're 80 with healthy joints.

38:53.456 --> 38:54.832
You should dream bigger.

38:55.541 --> 38:56.792
Make it 100.

38:56.876 --> 39:00.629
Wow, Hwa-jeong.
You've always been the bolder one.

39:02.214 --> 39:04.467
Give me one. I'll gulp down a packet.

39:04.550 --> 39:07.553
A packet right now? Got it.

39:12.224 --> 39:13.517
Here. Drink up.

39:15.770 --> 39:16.771
Bottoms up.

39:20.399 --> 39:21.400
Gosh.

39:22.443 --> 39:24.904
My personal AW Center
provides good service.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.158
I'm definitely happier.

39:35.081 --> 39:36.207
Hwa-jeong…

39:38.084 --> 39:39.085
Don't cry.

39:40.544 --> 39:41.712
Don't you dare cry!

39:41.796 --> 39:44.131
I won't. I won't cry.

40:10.908 --> 40:13.536
No, no. Just stay seated.

40:13.619 --> 40:17.039
Mother said that it's crucial
to recover well after giving birth.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.374
I told you to stay home.

40:18.457 --> 40:21.293
It's too stifling to stay in bed all day.

40:21.377 --> 40:23.838
I'll be careful.
Besides, those boxes need to be moved.

40:23.921 --> 40:25.840
I'll get to them, so sit.

40:26.715 --> 40:28.175
-Yun-gyeong,
-Yes?

40:28.259 --> 40:30.761
just sit there and watch. Okay?

40:38.477 --> 40:40.438
Are you shitting me?

40:40.521 --> 40:43.149
Yun-gyeong, is that Russian?

40:43.232 --> 40:44.733
Did Igor teach you that?

40:44.817 --> 40:48.320
I said I'd do it.
Why the hell do you have to insist?

40:48.404 --> 40:49.363
Are you blind?

40:49.447 --> 40:53.075
I liked it better
when she was pregnant and couldn't drink.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.035
Yun-gyeong, how about a third child?

40:55.119 --> 41:00.207
Are you seriously saying that when I'm
still recovering from having a damn baby?

41:00.291 --> 41:03.461
Do you have a death wish,
you goddamn bastard?

41:03.544 --> 41:07.047
Come here and die. Die, you piece of shit!

41:09.049 --> 41:12.094
Oh, no. I broke another one.

41:12.178 --> 41:13.471
Done.

41:13.554 --> 41:14.430
Let me see.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.516
You did it. Lucky you.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.519
Could the heart-shaped one be easier?

41:21.312 --> 41:22.938
That's what I should've bought.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.107
Here.

41:25.941 --> 41:26.901
It's for you.

41:26.984 --> 41:27.943
What?

41:29.445 --> 41:30.654
Choi Bo-ra,

41:31.530 --> 41:35.451
you know what my giving you
a heart means, right?

41:35.534 --> 41:37.995
Yes, of course. This heart right here?

41:40.122 --> 41:41.540
It's just a shape.

41:42.124 --> 41:43.125
It's tasty.

41:44.001 --> 41:46.587
But I put a lot of effort into it.

41:47.546 --> 41:48.797
And it meant a great deal.

41:50.049 --> 41:52.468
Hey, let's go to your place
to look at Seumseum.

41:52.551 --> 41:53.385
Sure.

42:08.651 --> 42:09.485
Chief Hong!

42:09.568 --> 42:12.154
Isn't Seoul too far away
to visit this often?

42:12.238 --> 42:13.322
I came for lunch.

42:13.405 --> 42:16.325
A little bird told me someone makes
a mean chicken porridge soup.

42:16.408 --> 42:18.035
That place is closed today.

42:18.118 --> 42:19.828
Why? I'd really like some!

42:22.039 --> 42:25.167
Chief Hong, it doesn't actually
have to be chicken porridge soup.

42:25.251 --> 42:27.878
The <i>gambas</i> was delicious enough.

42:27.962 --> 42:29.004
Let's order some pizza.

42:29.088 --> 42:32.258
What? Aren't you going to cook for me?

42:36.178 --> 42:37.012
Leave now,

42:37.096 --> 42:39.181
-and you can have dinner in Seoul.
-What…

42:40.432 --> 42:42.518
I love pizza, you know.

42:43.018 --> 42:44.311
It's the best.

42:45.229 --> 42:46.897
All right.

42:47.773 --> 42:50.359
-I'm a regular--
-Can you order two?

42:52.111 --> 42:53.779
At least a large then.

42:56.699 --> 42:59.201
There's an app I order often from.

42:59.868 --> 43:01.120
It's quick.

43:01.662 --> 43:03.205
What would you like? This one?

43:03.289 --> 43:04.206
-This.
-This?

43:04.290 --> 43:05.249
-Yes.
-This?

43:05.332 --> 43:06.709
No, this one.

43:07.459 --> 43:08.460
And the dough?

43:09.461 --> 43:10.296
That.

43:10.379 --> 43:11.505
All right.

43:14.216 --> 43:15.634
It looks good.

43:15.718 --> 43:16.719
Then let me…

43:25.019 --> 43:27.187
-What?
-Are you kidding me?

43:27.271 --> 43:29.648
-What do you mean?
-It's too delicious!

43:29.732 --> 43:33.402
Unbelievable.
Do you always have to make such a fuss?

43:33.485 --> 43:34.361
It's just pizza.

43:40.409 --> 43:42.453
-You weren't wrong.
-Isn't it good?

43:42.536 --> 43:44.997
-Gosh, it is.
-Goodness.

43:49.376 --> 43:53.255
When we first met, I never imagined
we'd become good friends.

43:53.339 --> 43:55.591
Life's pretty much the same for everyone.

43:56.133 --> 43:57.593
But are we good friends?

43:57.676 --> 43:59.762
Hey, are you saying we aren't?

44:01.305 --> 44:02.514
I'm not sure.

44:03.891 --> 44:07.519
Look. We're good friends.
You giving me garlic sauce proves it.

44:07.603 --> 44:09.063
I more of a hot sauce guy.

44:23.535 --> 44:24.703
That was delicious.

44:30.125 --> 44:32.378
Now, tell me why you came here.

44:32.461 --> 44:34.797
What do you mean? I just came for lunch.

44:34.880 --> 44:38.258
I can see worries and anguish
written all over your face.

44:38.926 --> 44:40.803
I drove to clear my head

44:40.886 --> 44:43.472
-and ended up here.
-Then you didn't get lost.

44:45.808 --> 44:48.352
I'm losing my way in life though.

44:49.937 --> 44:51.438
Because of Ms. Wang?

44:55.818 --> 44:57.569
We were always a team.

44:57.653 --> 45:00.447
Even after fighting each other
over creative differences,

45:00.531 --> 45:02.658
I always felt that we were a team.

45:02.741 --> 45:03.826
But?

45:05.285 --> 45:08.705
I hoped Ji-won would always be by my side.

45:10.624 --> 45:11.834
So I'm scared

45:13.293 --> 45:15.254
that if I make a hasty move,

45:16.630 --> 45:18.132
I might lose her forever.

45:18.215 --> 45:21.385
You're finally willing
to give it a try though.

45:24.596 --> 45:27.975
Jeez. It's like staying indoors
because you're afraid it might rain

45:28.058 --> 45:29.935
and starving, afraid of stomachaches.

45:30.561 --> 45:34.481
Stop hesitating, or you'll lose out
on the chance once again.

45:43.031 --> 45:44.032
Hello?

45:44.700 --> 45:45.576
Right now?

45:46.118 --> 45:47.411
Okay, I'll be right there.

45:49.371 --> 45:51.623
I'm sorry about this, but duty calls.

45:51.707 --> 45:53.041
Sure.

45:54.001 --> 45:55.919
-I'll wash the dishes.
-Thanks!

46:04.970 --> 46:06.847
WRITER WANG

46:24.364 --> 46:27.576
WANG JI-WON CELEBRATING
END OF HER FIRST SHOW

46:38.837 --> 46:39.671
Oh, my.

46:40.756 --> 46:42.049
-Hye-jin.
-Hi.

46:42.132 --> 46:44.009
-Hi.
-Shall we head inside?

46:44.092 --> 46:46.887
-Isn't the weather great?
-It sure is.

46:48.764 --> 46:51.642
I'm sorry your dad wasn't
able to spend time with you.

46:52.267 --> 46:53.810
Did you hear he went to a funeral?

46:54.353 --> 46:55.646
Yes, we talked on the phone.

46:57.064 --> 47:00.817
I've been meaning to treat you
to a tasty meal anyway, Mother.

47:01.902 --> 47:02.736
What?

47:04.780 --> 47:07.741
I see. Well, it's good.
It's absolutely delicious.

47:08.367 --> 47:10.369
-Please enjoy.
-Sure.

47:10.452 --> 47:12.120
Is Chief Hong well?

47:13.205 --> 47:14.540
Yes, he's doing great.

47:15.082 --> 47:17.125
I'll bring him to Seoul sometime.

47:17.209 --> 47:20.170
We should have a meal together
like we did in Gongjin.

47:21.380 --> 47:22.256
Hye-jin,

47:23.465 --> 47:27.553
do you remember when I invited you over
when you were in college?

47:27.636 --> 47:28.887
The day we first met.

47:29.763 --> 47:30.764
Yes.

47:32.057 --> 47:34.643
To be honest,
I was extremely nervous at first.

47:35.227 --> 47:38.313
Then you ate a piece of my braised potato

47:38.397 --> 47:40.899
and said that it was delicious.

47:42.651 --> 47:43.986
That was it.

47:44.069 --> 47:47.447
Things were still awkward,
so we kept eating quietly,

47:48.740 --> 47:51.410
but it warmed my heart to hear that.

47:52.995 --> 47:54.913
That's when I thought

47:54.997 --> 47:58.917
that joining your family
wouldn't be such a bad idea.

47:59.626 --> 48:01.420
That having meals together every day,

48:01.503 --> 48:04.047
praising the food,
and telling each other to eat up

48:05.048 --> 48:06.633
would be quite nice.

48:07.551 --> 48:11.013
The braised potatoes were divine.

48:12.723 --> 48:14.057
I'll cook them for you again.

48:14.141 --> 48:16.560
When you bring Chief Hong to Seoul,
come to the house.

48:17.311 --> 48:18.353
Okay.

48:18.437 --> 48:21.398
As you know, we have four seats
around our dining table.

48:23.775 --> 48:25.736
We have room for him.

48:26.445 --> 48:29.072
I'll make sure we visit soon.

48:29.156 --> 48:30.157
Good.

48:42.210 --> 48:44.338
Chief Hong, don't you read comic books?

48:44.963 --> 48:47.090
My favorite is <i>The Rose of Versailles</i>.

48:48.759 --> 48:52.262
Chief Hong, how about
we open the Chinese bush clover wine?

48:54.348 --> 48:55.849
If you're up for it, I mean.

48:58.143 --> 49:00.312
You should eat more braised beans.

49:00.395 --> 49:03.774
They may not seem tasty at first,
but they get sweeter as you chew.

49:03.857 --> 49:05.067
Eat more of them.

49:18.288 --> 49:19.623
I miss her like crazy.

49:29.883 --> 49:31.343
It sure is sweet.

49:34.262 --> 49:35.722
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

49:44.648 --> 49:47.275
Du-sik. What are you doing?

49:47.359 --> 49:49.861
Can't you see? I'm brewing coffee.

49:49.945 --> 49:52.406
No, you're not. What are you doing?

49:52.489 --> 49:54.825
What on earth?

49:55.534 --> 49:57.077
-Damn it.
-What were you thinking?

49:57.160 --> 49:59.955
You didn't even notice it spilling.

50:00.038 --> 50:01.707
It's nothing.

50:05.168 --> 50:06.002
Jeez.

50:07.462 --> 50:09.881
Chun-jae, I'm sorry,
but I need to step out for a bit.

50:09.965 --> 50:12.551
-Can you make the rest?
-Sure. Are you all right?

50:13.593 --> 50:15.262
Damn, it's hot! You bastard!

50:18.765 --> 50:20.934
Wait. Were my fingerprints burned off?

50:29.901 --> 50:30.861
Chief Hong!

50:40.162 --> 50:42.372
-I missed you so much.
-I missed you too.

50:49.045 --> 50:50.756
<i>I'm going to marry Chief Hong.</i>

50:52.966 --> 50:56.136
Go ahead. I'm planning
to get married next spring,

50:56.219 --> 50:57.512
so catch my bouquet first.

50:57.596 --> 50:59.014
I'm going to propose tomorrow.

50:59.097 --> 51:00.223
What?

51:00.307 --> 51:03.477
Is tomorrow too soon?
How about the day after that?

51:03.560 --> 51:06.897
Of course. I shouldn't have
expected any less from Yoon Hye-jin.

51:06.980 --> 51:09.691
Why on earth are you rushing it?

51:11.610 --> 51:14.029
Because I don't like seeing him all alone.

51:15.572 --> 51:17.824
I want to be his family.

51:19.326 --> 51:21.036
Hye-jin,

51:21.912 --> 51:23.830
when did you grow up?

51:24.539 --> 51:26.249
Will you catch my bouquet?

51:26.833 --> 51:29.836
Hye-jin, don't get ahead of yourself.

51:29.920 --> 51:31.588
Chief Hong might say no.

51:32.547 --> 51:33.423
I doubt it.

51:35.050 --> 51:36.510
That never crossed my mind.

51:36.593 --> 51:39.971
Don't sweat it. He'll say yes
if your proposal is good enough.

51:40.555 --> 51:41.723
What do you have in mind?

51:42.349 --> 51:45.977
Well, I thought about it
while driving back to Gongjin,

51:46.561 --> 51:48.730
but I came up with nothing.

51:49.314 --> 51:50.649
Maybe I lack creativity.

51:50.732 --> 51:54.945
No, Korea's education system is to blame.

51:55.028 --> 51:58.573
You're only a victim
of the nation's rote learning method.

51:58.657 --> 52:02.619
I want it to be a proposal
that he'll never forget.

52:04.496 --> 52:05.831
What could be a good idea?

52:05.914 --> 52:09.543
If you're drawing a blank,
then go back to the basics.

52:10.335 --> 52:12.921
Don't try to come up with something grand,

52:13.004 --> 52:15.799
and slowly think about
your memories with him.

52:16.466 --> 52:20.011
That is where you will find your answer!

52:25.892 --> 52:27.143
What is it?

52:27.811 --> 52:29.938
You're amazing. You're a genius.

52:47.330 --> 52:49.958
MS. DENTIST

52:50.041 --> 52:52.335
<i>Chief Hong, meet me at the beach.</i>

53:10.645 --> 53:11.855
Gosh.

53:12.898 --> 53:14.190
What are you thinking about?

53:15.567 --> 53:19.654
Well, I was reminded
of the day we first met.

53:20.697 --> 53:22.824
We were both such a mess.

53:22.908 --> 53:25.702
Absolutely. It was the worst.

53:28.872 --> 53:30.540
<i>It probably wasn't just me.</i>

53:31.541 --> 53:32.709
<i>You must've</i>

53:33.460 --> 53:35.670
<i>found me extremely peculiar too.</i>

53:37.297 --> 53:38.757
<i>A woman you just met</i>

53:38.840 --> 53:42.093
<i>asked you to find her shoe for her
and lend her money.</i>

53:43.470 --> 53:46.514
<i>We butt heads all day.</i>

53:52.312 --> 53:55.148
But the crashing waves of that day…

53:56.441 --> 54:00.028
brought us to this moment right here,

54:00.695 --> 54:02.948
just like these shoes came back to me.

54:09.746 --> 54:11.164
I'd love it

54:11.831 --> 54:13.249
if our shoes…

54:14.751 --> 54:17.337
were always side by side
at the door together.

54:20.173 --> 54:21.633
So that neither would be lonely.

54:24.219 --> 54:25.303
Chief Hong.

54:28.306 --> 54:29.724
Will you marry me?

54:30.225 --> 54:31.434
No.

54:31.518 --> 54:33.269
-What?
-No.

54:33.353 --> 54:34.604
Don't you want to?

54:34.688 --> 54:37.649
No, that's not what I mean. I…

54:37.732 --> 54:41.152
Why… I mean, why are you…

54:44.030 --> 54:44.990
What's wrong?

54:52.080 --> 54:54.040
I was going to propose to you today too.

54:54.124 --> 54:55.917
I wanted to ask you first.

54:56.918 --> 55:00.088
I've been preparing it for ages.
How could this…

55:00.171 --> 55:01.423
You beat me to it.

55:01.506 --> 55:05.010
Well, it doesn't really matter
who does it first.

55:05.093 --> 55:07.554
What matters is
that we're on the same page.

55:08.471 --> 55:12.100
All right, then.
You take the lead from here.

55:12.183 --> 55:14.144
I'll hand over the baton.

55:15.103 --> 55:16.563
Consider this a relay race.

55:16.646 --> 55:20.817
You're the last runner,
so run towards that finish line.

55:20.900 --> 55:21.818
Go ahead.

55:21.901 --> 55:23.445
How can I do it after that?

55:23.528 --> 55:25.280
No, you can do this.

55:25.363 --> 55:26.489
You got this.

55:35.623 --> 55:40.045
You said our first encounter
was on the worst terms.

55:42.881 --> 55:44.132
Not for me though.

55:50.013 --> 55:52.140
<i>I saw a woman on the beach that day.</i>

55:53.308 --> 55:55.185
<i>She sat there for a long time,</i>

55:56.144 --> 55:58.313
<i>but all I could see
was sadness in her eyes.</i>

56:00.732 --> 56:03.943
<i>And I couldn't get it out of my mind,</i>

56:05.320 --> 56:07.197
<i>so my eyes kept being drawn to her.</i>

56:12.077 --> 56:13.328
But I never thought…

56:15.580 --> 56:17.540
that I'd fall in love with her.

56:33.765 --> 56:34.933
Chief Hong!

56:35.517 --> 56:38.353
I worked 637 hours
to get you this necklace.

56:38.978 --> 56:40.814
Don't you dare sell it online.

56:43.274 --> 56:44.526
But this is expensive.

56:46.236 --> 56:48.321
I won't sell it. Ever.

56:49.155 --> 56:50.532
I will never sell it.

56:51.658 --> 56:54.119
Two pairs of shoes by the door,

56:54.744 --> 56:56.788
two toothbrushes in the bathroom,

56:56.871 --> 56:59.082
and two aprons in the kitchen.

57:00.583 --> 57:02.377
Everything will be in pairs.

57:03.086 --> 57:06.798
In a house where we keep those,
will you enjoy today, tomorrow,

57:08.007 --> 57:09.384
and all of your time…

57:10.718 --> 57:12.011
with me?

57:18.560 --> 57:19.519
I love you.

57:20.937 --> 57:22.063
I love you too.

57:47.046 --> 57:48.798
God, it's cold! What?

57:48.882 --> 57:49.841
What?

57:52.886 --> 57:54.429
Your shoe!

57:54.512 --> 57:56.264
What? No, my shoe!

58:40.850 --> 58:42.352
-What are you up to?
-Oh, this?

58:42.936 --> 58:46.147
I'm drafting an agreement
for married life.

58:46.231 --> 58:49.442
Jeez, Hye-jin, how far ahead are you?

58:49.526 --> 58:52.862
I like planning my life ahead,
but to the extreme.

58:53.530 --> 58:55.949
So tell me. What have you written so far?

58:56.491 --> 59:00.787
First of all, I'm terrible in the kitchen.

59:00.870 --> 59:02.622
You know what happens.

59:02.705 --> 59:04.332
I know it all too well.

59:04.415 --> 59:06.626
Don't you ever get your hands wet.

59:06.709 --> 59:08.670
Nice. Lucky me.

59:10.797 --> 59:14.300
In return, I'll make sure
you always have healthy teeth.

59:14.384 --> 59:16.761
I'm the luckier one. I love it.

59:16.844 --> 59:18.555
Really? So that'll be my job.

59:18.638 --> 59:20.932
However, I do like doing the laundry.

59:21.015 --> 59:24.852
All the pricey clothes I have
require proper maintenance.

59:24.936 --> 59:26.604
Okay. Then leave the cleaning to me.

59:26.688 --> 59:29.983
All right. Cleaning goes to Chief Hong.

59:30.066 --> 59:31.234
CHIEF HONG

59:32.944 --> 59:33.945
By the way,

59:35.488 --> 59:38.533
how much longer will you be an area chief?

59:39.117 --> 59:41.119
I've never thought about that. Why?

59:41.202 --> 59:45.832
If it's the community you wish to serve,

59:45.915 --> 59:49.335
there are other titles to consider.

59:49.419 --> 59:51.588
Broaden your horizons a little.

59:51.671 --> 59:54.340
Above the area chief is the zone chief.

59:55.508 --> 59:58.344
You know, Hwa-jeong's term is almost over.

59:58.428 --> 1:00:00.847
-No, aim a little higher.
-What?

1:00:00.930 --> 1:00:03.600
Well, for instance,

1:00:03.683 --> 1:00:07.562
there's also a city councilor
or a congressman.

1:00:07.645 --> 1:00:11.274
Again with that ambition of yours.

1:00:12.233 --> 1:00:17.030
It's just that you're too good
to stay as a mere area chief.

1:00:17.113 --> 1:00:18.573
You're adorable.

1:00:19.407 --> 1:00:22.452
Speaking of which,
when will you stop calling me Chief Hong?

1:00:22.535 --> 1:00:24.287
What should I call you then?

1:00:24.871 --> 1:00:26.873
Say my name like I say yours.

1:00:28.333 --> 1:00:29.250
Your name?

1:00:30.126 --> 1:00:31.461
Your name…

1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:33.755
Du-sik.

1:00:35.632 --> 1:00:36.633
Du-sik.

1:00:38.968 --> 1:00:41.638
Why does your name have to be so funny?

1:00:41.721 --> 1:00:44.057
How can you say that one's name is funny?

1:00:44.140 --> 1:00:46.559
It's not even funny in a cute way.

1:00:47.852 --> 1:00:50.772
Then I guess you can call me <i>oppa</i>.

1:00:50.855 --> 1:00:54.484
-You said you'd kill me if I did.
-That was then, and this is now.

1:00:55.401 --> 1:00:56.402
<i>Oppa</i>.

1:00:57.779 --> 1:00:58.613
<i>Oppa</i>.

1:01:00.198 --> 1:01:01.616
<i>Oppa</i>…

1:01:03.076 --> 1:01:05.286
That's weird.
It still gives me the chills.

1:01:05.370 --> 1:01:06.371
My hair is standing.

1:01:06.913 --> 1:01:08.498
So what should I call you?

1:01:08.998 --> 1:01:12.543
If not that or your name,

1:01:12.627 --> 1:01:13.961
how about <i>jagi</i>?

1:01:14.045 --> 1:01:15.129
I quite like that.

1:01:15.213 --> 1:01:16.297
You like it?

1:01:16.381 --> 1:01:17.590
Yes, I do.

1:01:17.674 --> 1:01:20.760
As you know, <i>jagi</i> also means oneself.

1:01:21.427 --> 1:01:22.804
So it feels like

1:01:22.887 --> 1:01:24.722
I'm you

1:01:25.390 --> 1:01:27.600
and you've become me in a way.

1:01:27.684 --> 1:01:28.810
<i>Jagi.</i>

1:01:29.811 --> 1:01:32.855
I'm you, and you're me.

1:01:50.039 --> 1:01:51.457
I'm not going home tonight.

1:01:52.750 --> 1:01:54.252
I wasn't going to let you.

1:02:48.806 --> 1:02:50.016
All right.

1:03:04.739 --> 1:03:06.365
-Are you awake?
-Yes.

1:03:07.158 --> 1:03:08.534
You must be hungry.

1:03:08.618 --> 1:03:10.995
I made toast and eggs for you. Try some.

1:03:11.078 --> 1:03:12.288
It's all right.

1:03:12.371 --> 1:03:13.664
Don't you want to eat?

1:03:13.748 --> 1:03:17.794
It's just that
I can't use my hands right now.

1:03:18.836 --> 1:03:20.880
I'm not dressed yet.

1:03:21.631 --> 1:03:22.757
Then…

1:03:23.508 --> 1:03:24.926
stay as you are. I'll feed you.

1:03:26.511 --> 1:03:27.887
-Just a second.
-Sure.

1:03:32.308 --> 1:03:33.434
Open wide.

1:03:34.602 --> 1:03:36.562
There you go. Is it good?

1:03:36.646 --> 1:03:39.232
It's delicious. Can I have some milk?

1:03:39.816 --> 1:03:42.652
Milk? Just a second.
Be careful not to spill.

1:03:50.117 --> 1:03:53.371
This is nice.
I love the room service you provide.

1:03:53.454 --> 1:03:55.581
I'll do this for you
every day from now on.

1:03:56.165 --> 1:03:57.041
Okay.

1:03:58.167 --> 1:03:59.627
-One more.
-One more?

1:04:00.294 --> 1:04:01.128
Here.

1:04:05.633 --> 1:04:06.592
Two would be nice.

1:04:07.260 --> 1:04:08.886
-What?
-Kids.

1:04:09.470 --> 1:04:11.013
An only child would be lonely,

1:04:11.097 --> 1:04:13.432
and three would be too difficult,

1:04:13.516 --> 1:04:16.310
so two will be nice regardless of gender.

1:04:17.019 --> 1:04:18.312
Two?

1:04:19.272 --> 1:04:21.858
I guess we should get busy then.

1:04:24.902 --> 1:04:26.863
-What time is it?
-Nine o'clock.

1:04:28.114 --> 1:04:29.407
The neighborhood cleaning!

1:04:29.490 --> 1:04:30.950
Don't be ridiculous.

1:04:31.033 --> 1:04:34.120
We should skip it today.
We're allowed to at times.

1:04:35.037 --> 1:04:38.082
Other people may,
but not me and the one I love.

1:04:38.165 --> 1:04:40.626
Get out of bed already.
And breakfast is over.

1:04:41.294 --> 1:04:43.212
But I only got one bite.

1:04:43.796 --> 1:04:45.423
-Chop-chop!
-Fine.

1:04:46.048 --> 1:04:49.093
But you want two kids.
Shouldn't we get on it?

1:04:50.219 --> 1:04:52.346
We're late. Come on.

1:04:52.430 --> 1:04:54.056
Gosh.

1:04:54.140 --> 1:04:55.558
Hye-jin, here.

1:04:55.641 --> 1:04:57.018
-Is this in my size?
-Yes.

1:04:57.101 --> 1:04:58.394
Are you sure it's mine?

1:04:58.477 --> 1:05:01.230
-Over here.
-You call that sweeping?

1:05:01.314 --> 1:05:04.150
It's clean enough, so stop it.

1:05:04.233 --> 1:05:06.152
-Good morning.
-Are they just joining us?

1:05:06.235 --> 1:05:08.613
-We already swept over here.
-Don't mind us.

1:05:08.696 --> 1:05:10.406
-Keep sweeping.
-Aren't you hungry?

1:05:10.489 --> 1:05:12.450
-Let's get going.
-We should have breakfast.

1:05:12.533 --> 1:05:14.076
-Sure.
-Wait for me.

1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:15.620
We're getting married.

1:05:16.245 --> 1:05:18.414
-What?
-What?

1:05:18.497 --> 1:05:19.957
We're getting married.

1:05:20.541 --> 1:05:22.209
Say something.

1:05:23.419 --> 1:05:24.420
We're…

1:05:25.296 --> 1:05:26.422
really getting married.

1:05:26.505 --> 1:05:28.215
-What?
-Really?

1:06:25.606 --> 1:06:27.984
Why are you so late?
There's only ten minutes left!

1:06:28.067 --> 1:06:31.070
Sorry. The clock
in the living room was broken.

1:06:31.153 --> 1:06:33.823
Seriously, you're such a slacker
unless you're working.

1:06:33.906 --> 1:06:35.074
Is it this way?

1:06:35.157 --> 1:06:36.742
-Wait.
-What is it?

1:06:37.368 --> 1:06:38.452
What? I see.

1:06:41.330 --> 1:06:42.832
-Am I good?
-Good.

1:06:42.915 --> 1:06:45.793
-Let's go.
-Director Ji, your shoes!

1:06:45.876 --> 1:06:48.337
-Change your shoes.
-Right.

1:06:53.509 --> 1:06:54.885
Hey.

1:06:55.553 --> 1:06:58.639
What are you going to do without me?

1:06:58.723 --> 1:07:00.141
I can't do without you.

1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:04.395
Since you've brought it up,

1:07:04.478 --> 1:07:07.356
let's discuss my idea for my next show.

1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:11.193
And get a bite to eat after.
I know all the great spots.

1:07:11.277 --> 1:07:13.404
-What are you doing?
-What else?

1:07:13.988 --> 1:07:17.074
I'm asking you out to eat.
Just the two of us.

1:07:18.951 --> 1:07:21.370
Not only that, we have so much to do.

1:07:21.454 --> 1:07:24.582
We have so many places to go
in the country and overseas.

1:07:24.665 --> 1:07:28.210
Next time, let's climb up
the Florence Cathedral without fail.

1:07:29.170 --> 1:07:31.422
You couldn't go up last time
because of me.

1:07:33.424 --> 1:07:34.842
Seong-hyeon…

1:07:37.678 --> 1:07:40.973
No matter how hard I think about it,

1:07:41.057 --> 1:07:44.560
eating, playing, and working…

1:07:45.895 --> 1:07:47.563
I want to do it all with you.

1:07:49.315 --> 1:07:51.108
I hope…

1:07:52.026 --> 1:07:54.403
you continue to stay busy with me, Ji-won.

1:08:02.703 --> 1:08:05.748
We're late, you know. Hurry up.

1:08:07.750 --> 1:08:08.959
Let's go.

1:08:09.043 --> 1:08:10.127
Run!

1:08:38.781 --> 1:08:40.908
"With high hopes, Director Ji added that,

1:08:40.991 --> 1:08:44.662
'<i>The Seashore Grasshopper</i> can help us
find joy in our slow-paced everyday life

1:08:44.745 --> 1:08:49.875
and reset what we view as true happiness.'

1:08:49.959 --> 1:08:54.672
<i>The Seashore Grasshopper</i>
premieres on the 23rd at 9:10 p.m."

1:08:56.924 --> 1:08:59.051
-There you go.
-We'll definitely watch!

1:08:59.135 --> 1:09:01.554
Must you embarrass me
by reading it out loud?

1:09:01.637 --> 1:09:03.097
How can I not?

1:09:03.180 --> 1:09:06.600
I didn't realize Seoul was so closeby,
he's here too often.

1:09:06.684 --> 1:09:08.394
Don't be mean to him.

1:09:08.477 --> 1:09:12.064
-Visit often, Seong-hyeon.
-Sure thing.

1:09:12.565 --> 1:09:16.485
Did you really come all this way
to watch the premiere with us?

1:09:16.569 --> 1:09:18.195
Yes, I really wanted to.

1:09:18.279 --> 1:09:21.991
You're the hidden heroes
that made the show happen!

1:09:22.074 --> 1:09:23.617
No, hold that thought!

1:09:23.701 --> 1:09:26.453
-The true hero of the show is DOS.
-Oh gosh.

1:09:26.537 --> 1:09:27.496
Don't say that.

1:09:27.580 --> 1:09:30.416
I'm glad you came. The more, the merrier.

1:09:30.499 --> 1:09:32.001
-Of course.
-Hold on a second.

1:09:32.084 --> 1:09:34.753
Did I call my daughter
to tell her to watch the show?

1:09:34.837 --> 1:09:37.214
-I call ten percent ratings.
-Director Ji, hold on.

1:09:37.298 --> 1:09:40.801
The scene we're in
isn't in the first episode, right?

1:09:40.885 --> 1:09:43.888
Was my outburst
edited out of the final cut?

1:09:44.513 --> 1:09:46.432
Our Bo-ra will be watching, you see.

1:09:46.515 --> 1:09:49.935
I wasn't aware of it that day,
but my armpits were like, you know.

1:09:50.561 --> 1:09:52.605
Jeez, how embarrassing.

1:09:53.105 --> 1:09:56.233
We'll be able to see Gam-ri again.

1:10:00.863 --> 1:10:03.657
-Goodness.
-Granny Gam-ri.

1:10:03.741 --> 1:10:05.910
-You're right.
-I miss her.

1:10:05.993 --> 1:10:07.536
Hey! The show's starting!

1:10:08.495 --> 1:10:10.998
-All right.
-Here we go. The show's airing.

1:10:11.081 --> 1:10:12.708
Can you make the screen brighter?

1:10:12.791 --> 1:10:15.544
-Dad, I think it's your age.
-Take off your shades at night.

1:10:15.628 --> 1:10:18.255
-Right.
-You're unbelievable.

1:10:23.260 --> 1:10:25.554
Double-digit ratings in this day and age?

1:10:26.931 --> 1:10:30.809
No wonder Director Ji
didn't choose a career in music.

1:10:30.893 --> 1:10:32.603
That's pure talent right there.

1:10:33.145 --> 1:10:36.774
Of course. You'd expect nothing less
when the show features a celeb--

1:10:39.652 --> 1:10:41.528
It's from Seoul. Who could it be?

1:10:43.781 --> 1:10:45.199
Hello, who's calling?

1:10:45.282 --> 1:10:46.784
<i>Yes, hello.</i>

1:10:46.867 --> 1:10:49.995
-<i>Is this singer Oh Yoon I'm speaking to?</i>
-What?

1:10:50.746 --> 1:10:54.416
Right! Yes, that's me. What is this about?

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:57.711
<i>Hello, I'm calling on behalf of
the JKBC show</i>, Sugar People.

1:10:57.795 --> 1:10:59.088
What did you just say?

1:11:00.256 --> 1:11:04.093
<i>We were hoping to have you on the show
as a former legend in the industry.</i>

1:11:04.593 --> 1:11:05.844
Sure thing.

1:11:06.470 --> 1:11:09.682
Dad, I'm hungry. Give me food.
My stomach's completely hollow.

1:11:09.765 --> 1:11:11.225
-Ju-ri.
-What?

1:11:12.685 --> 1:11:15.271
-Can you pinch my cheek?
-No way.

1:11:15.354 --> 1:11:18.274
Your face is too greasy.
I don't want to touch it.

1:11:19.316 --> 1:11:22.569
-Just this once.
-But it's slippery.

1:11:25.614 --> 1:11:26.865
Let go!

1:11:28.450 --> 1:11:30.911
I didn't mean for you
to do it so hard like that!

1:11:30.995 --> 1:11:32.913
But you told me to pinch you.

1:11:33.414 --> 1:11:34.623
Anyway, it hurts.

1:11:38.043 --> 1:11:41.338
My cheek is throbbing.
I felt all of the pain.

1:11:41.422 --> 1:11:43.132
Dad, what's with you?

1:11:44.383 --> 1:11:46.010
-Ju-ri.
-Yes?

1:11:46.093 --> 1:11:48.762
-I'll going to be on <i>Sugar People</i>.
-What?

1:11:48.846 --> 1:11:51.640
-I'll be on <i>Sugar People</i>.
-What? Really?

1:11:51.724 --> 1:11:55.644
-Hold on a second. Where is it?
-What's wrong?

1:11:58.314 --> 1:12:00.691
Dad, do you know who the other guests are?

1:12:00.774 --> 1:12:01.942
Could it be DOS?

1:12:03.193 --> 1:12:06.447
-I said I'll be on <i>Sugar People</i>.
-So tell me about DOS.

1:12:06.530 --> 1:12:09.575
-Why would you ask about Dos?
-They're called D-O-S.

1:12:09.658 --> 1:12:12.036
Didn't you hear that
I'll be on <i>Sugar People</i>?

1:12:12.119 --> 1:12:13.537
So? What about it?

1:12:13.620 --> 1:12:18.375
The Seashore Grasshopper <i>helped
Chun-jae become the singer Oh Yoon again.</i>

1:12:18.959 --> 1:12:22.880
<i>And the other villagers
received their own gifts as well.</i>

1:12:22.963 --> 1:12:25.132
-Can we have more side dishes?
-Sure.

1:12:25.215 --> 1:12:28.093
-The food is delicious.
-Really? Gosh, thank you.

1:12:28.177 --> 1:12:31.555
-Ma'am, when will our dish be served?
-Your fish stew is nearly ready.

1:12:31.638 --> 1:12:33.098
-We've been--
-It won't be long.

1:12:33.182 --> 1:12:37.186
Coming! Aren't you a sweetheart
for ordering two dishes?

1:12:37.269 --> 1:12:38.937
-Ma'am.
-Yes, I'll be right over.

1:12:39.021 --> 1:12:41.565
-<i>I see you're finished</i>
-The food was great.

1:12:41.648 --> 1:12:44.151
-Thank you. Please come again.
-Thank you.

1:12:44.234 --> 1:12:47.279
You can sit right here.
I'll clear the table for you. Thank you.

1:12:47.363 --> 1:12:49.990
This right here is the autograph
of a DOS member.

1:12:50.074 --> 1:12:52.076
-You've heard of DOS, right?
-Of course.

1:12:52.785 --> 1:12:53.911
You may take a photo.

1:12:53.994 --> 1:12:57.164
<i>The short but blindingly bright summer</i>

1:12:57.247 --> 1:12:59.416
<i>had Gongjin bustling.</i>

1:13:17.476 --> 1:13:21.855
<i>And the blissful days
continued to pour in.</i>

1:13:30.364 --> 1:13:32.616
So what's the next show about?

1:13:33.242 --> 1:13:37.371
I always develop my ideas
based on my interests.

1:13:38.580 --> 1:13:41.834
First food, then traveling.
So what are you now interested in?

1:13:41.917 --> 1:13:45.129
How about a dating show
with non-celebrities?

1:13:45.712 --> 1:13:46.672
What?

1:13:46.755 --> 1:13:49.591
Viewers will get to see
if there can be something more

1:13:49.675 --> 1:13:52.428
between those who have been
in the friend zone for years.

1:13:56.682 --> 1:13:58.100
Like us?

1:14:00.310 --> 1:14:02.396
Yes, like us.

1:14:07.067 --> 1:14:08.068
Got it.

1:14:08.610 --> 1:14:11.363
Good. I like that idea.

1:14:11.447 --> 1:14:13.907
-Wasn't it Pinocchio who sang that song?
-That's right.

1:14:13.991 --> 1:14:15.868
Since his nose grows when he lies.

1:14:15.951 --> 1:14:18.245
Yes, exactly. Get that down, Ji-won.

1:14:18.328 --> 1:14:20.622
Pinocchio has a nose that…

1:14:21.457 --> 1:14:24.418
Something in the air seems off.

1:14:28.505 --> 1:14:29.465
It's too stuffy.

1:14:30.966 --> 1:14:34.761
Is an air purifier really too much to ask?

1:14:35.262 --> 1:14:37.473
I doubt that's something
to smile about though.

1:14:37.556 --> 1:14:38.724
Any good news, Do-ha?

1:14:38.807 --> 1:14:43.061
My dad walked for the first time
with his leg braces on.

1:14:43.145 --> 1:14:45.606
Really? That's great.

1:14:46.356 --> 1:14:47.900
Yes, it's a miracle.

1:14:47.983 --> 1:14:49.401
It sure is.

1:14:49.985 --> 1:14:51.820
How is his overall health doing?

1:14:51.904 --> 1:14:53.447
-He's good.
-Really?

1:14:53.530 --> 1:14:55.115
Don't you worry, Do-ha.

1:14:55.199 --> 1:14:57.034
I'm not worried at all.

1:14:57.117 --> 1:14:58.118
Have a seat.

1:14:59.703 --> 1:15:02.080
You should be worried
about this meeting though.

1:15:02.164 --> 1:15:03.373
Got any ideas?

1:15:14.134 --> 1:15:16.512
<i>Jagi</i>, how do I look?

1:15:32.861 --> 1:15:33.946
Absolutely stunning.

1:15:34.029 --> 1:15:36.073
-Really?
-Yes.

1:15:36.156 --> 1:15:38.617
The clothes, I mean.
Outfits can change one's image.

1:15:39.284 --> 1:15:41.912
-Are you kidding me?
-Where are they?

1:15:41.995 --> 1:15:43.080
Where are what?

1:15:43.163 --> 1:15:46.500
Your wings.
Shouldn't an angel have a pair?

1:15:46.583 --> 1:15:48.168
I set them aside today.

1:15:48.252 --> 1:15:50.254
-Is that so?
-Yes.

1:15:50.337 --> 1:15:51.380
Well, you're stunning.

1:15:51.463 --> 1:15:52.923
-Really?
-Yes.

1:15:56.510 --> 1:15:59.429
Who knew your birthday gift
would be your wedding photo suit?

1:15:59.513 --> 1:16:01.181
I should have bought a nicer one.

1:16:01.265 --> 1:16:04.393
Forget it. I'm fond of this one.
It's more than enough.

1:16:04.977 --> 1:16:08.605
Okay. Let's get you a better one
for the wedding though.

1:16:10.315 --> 1:16:13.151
You haven't forgotten about
the dress fitting next week, right?

1:16:13.652 --> 1:16:16.905
-Already?
-The wedding is right around the corner.

1:16:16.989 --> 1:16:18.574
We can't afford to lose focus.

1:16:18.657 --> 1:16:21.660
What about booking a tour bus for the day?

1:16:21.743 --> 1:16:24.371
We need to bring
everyone in Gongjin to Seoul.

1:16:24.454 --> 1:16:26.415
-I already booked one.
-Good job.

1:16:26.498 --> 1:16:28.458
I'm a bit surprised though.

1:16:28.542 --> 1:16:31.753
I thought you'd want
to shoot photos at a studio.

1:16:31.837 --> 1:16:35.048
Well, the concept of our wedding
is "harmony," you see.

1:16:35.632 --> 1:16:40.304
It's a collaboration
between glamour and simplicity.

1:16:43.515 --> 1:16:47.102
Besides, the wedding's in Seoul,

1:16:47.644 --> 1:16:49.980
so I wanted to take the photos in Gongjin.

1:16:51.273 --> 1:16:53.567
It's where our lives crossed paths

1:16:54.109 --> 1:16:56.445
and where we'll continue to live.

1:17:00.741 --> 1:17:01.575
Shall we?

1:17:13.003 --> 1:17:13.837
Let's go.

1:17:14.504 --> 1:17:16.757
Can you believe how good the weather is?

1:17:16.840 --> 1:17:18.634
-Let's take great photos.
-Sure.

1:17:18.717 --> 1:17:20.344
-What on earth?
-My gosh.

1:17:20.427 --> 1:17:21.928
Are you taking your own photos?

1:17:22.012 --> 1:17:24.222
Yes, we thought we'd keep it small.

1:17:24.306 --> 1:17:26.433
You two look amazing today.

1:17:26.516 --> 1:17:29.561
But don't you need a young assistant
to help you take your photos?

1:17:29.645 --> 1:17:31.313
Let me be of help. I can do that.

1:17:31.396 --> 1:17:33.607
-It's all right.
-There's no need for that.

1:17:33.690 --> 1:17:35.525
No need to decline. Don't be sorry.

1:17:35.609 --> 1:17:38.862
I'll hold your veil,
assist you with your dress,

1:17:38.945 --> 1:17:40.781
and retouch your makeup.

1:17:40.864 --> 1:17:42.366
I'm really fine with my makeup.

1:17:42.449 --> 1:17:45.035
You once said you liked this shade.
It's strawberry milk.

1:17:45.118 --> 1:17:47.537
-This will look much better on you.
-But we're fine.

1:17:47.621 --> 1:17:50.040
-It's really fine--
-Where are you headed? Over there?

1:17:50.123 --> 1:17:52.417
-The view over there is better.
-Can you at least breathe?

1:17:52.501 --> 1:17:54.961
-Nam-suk--
-You both look stunning today.

1:17:55.045 --> 1:17:57.422
I looked just like her
on my wedding day as well.

1:17:57.506 --> 1:17:59.633
-You sure did.
-Come on. Let's go.

1:17:59.716 --> 1:18:01.134
-I can't believe this.
-I'm good.

1:18:01.218 --> 1:18:02.427
-Are you all right?
-Yes. Hold on.

1:18:02.511 --> 1:18:03.679
Wait for us then.

1:18:05.222 --> 1:18:06.932
You guys look incredible.

1:18:07.015 --> 1:18:08.600
Guys, I came rushing over.

1:18:08.684 --> 1:18:10.310
-Chun-jae, that was fast.
-I came running.

1:18:10.394 --> 1:18:11.728
I called him over.

1:18:11.812 --> 1:18:13.605
-You look amazing.
-Doesn't she?

1:18:14.106 --> 1:18:16.608
It's just good old me, so be at ease.

1:18:16.692 --> 1:18:20.153
-A wedding must have music.
-What will you sing?

1:18:23.532 --> 1:18:25.784
-Du-sik! We have experience.
-Wait for us!

1:18:25.867 --> 1:18:28.286
You'll need help with the poses,

1:18:28.370 --> 1:18:31.039
-so let us coach you.
-Doesn't she look stunning?

1:18:31.123 --> 1:18:34.251
You can retouch the shape of your body,
but not your facial expression!

1:18:34.334 --> 1:18:36.670
-Now, smile for us.
-Goodness.

1:18:36.753 --> 1:18:38.880
-Smile!
-You look incredible!

1:18:42.634 --> 1:18:44.678
-Guys!
-You came! Doesn't she look nice?

1:18:44.761 --> 1:18:47.764
-Nice!
-Okay, we're here as well.

1:18:47.848 --> 1:18:50.809
How long has it been
since we had a wedding in this town?

1:18:50.892 --> 1:18:52.060
Goodness.

1:18:53.979 --> 1:18:55.856
Gam-ri, are you watching this?

1:18:55.939 --> 1:18:58.066
-Du-sik is getting married!
-Du-sik!

1:18:58.150 --> 1:18:59.943
-Let's go.
-Here we go.

1:19:00.026 --> 1:19:02.988
-All right.
-Can you make sure her dress doesn't drag?

1:19:03.071 --> 1:19:04.865
Off we go!

1:19:04.948 --> 1:19:08.368
You must be thrilled
to have us all congratulate you.

1:19:08.452 --> 1:19:10.912
Is Uncle Du-sik seriously in a suit?

1:19:10.996 --> 1:19:12.330
Hey, Ju-ri!

1:19:12.414 --> 1:19:13.874
Hye-jin, was that dress the best option?

1:19:15.125 --> 1:19:16.168
-Ju-ri.
-Ju-ri!

1:19:16.251 --> 1:19:17.169
Is it a Sunday?

1:19:17.252 --> 1:19:18.503
Stop that.

1:19:19.463 --> 1:19:22.007
Whatever. Let's just get going.

1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:28.972
<i>Our very own Chief Hong is getting married</i>

1:19:29.055 --> 1:19:31.725
Mi-seon, why don't we join them
and learn a few things?

1:19:31.808 --> 1:19:34.478
This is all because
you have a singer in the mix.

1:19:34.561 --> 1:19:36.188
Guys, hurry on over.

1:19:41.860 --> 1:19:43.445
I don't even know anymore.

1:19:45.071 --> 1:19:48.700
-Come on!
-Du-sik, watch this.

1:19:49.367 --> 1:19:51.203
Don't tense up. Relax!

1:19:53.330 --> 1:19:54.664
Let's go!

1:20:00.504 --> 1:20:03.048
One, two, three.

1:20:05.759 --> 1:20:07.427
-<i>Congratulations</i>
-How was that good

1:20:07.511 --> 1:20:10.472
when her veil was covering her face?
Let's take another one.

1:20:10.555 --> 1:20:11.723
-It's okay--
-Take it again.

1:20:11.807 --> 1:20:13.266
Honey, do something about the sun.

1:20:13.350 --> 1:20:15.143
Don't worry. It's fine.

1:20:15.227 --> 1:20:18.021
-We're fine. Really.
-You can't sweat.

1:20:18.104 --> 1:20:19.314
No, like this.

1:20:19.397 --> 1:20:22.484
Don't stay over there
and get back behind the camera.

1:20:22.567 --> 1:20:24.528
Are these really self-shot wedding photos?

1:20:25.487 --> 1:20:26.321
Beats me.

1:20:26.404 --> 1:20:29.282
It looks stunning from here too.
Why don't you move this way?

1:20:29.366 --> 1:20:32.077
-The sea will be in the photo as well.
-She's right.

1:20:32.160 --> 1:20:34.496
I totally feel a song coming to me.

1:20:34.579 --> 1:20:37.123
These are wedding photos,
so shouldn't there

1:20:37.207 --> 1:20:39.417
-at least be one of you kissing?
-No, we're good.

1:20:39.501 --> 1:20:41.419
What? No, a kiss isn't necessary.

1:20:41.503 --> 1:20:44.422
Exactly! A kiss in public
will be too embarrassing for everyone.

1:20:45.131 --> 1:20:48.510
One should have a kissing photo.
We have one too, right?

1:20:48.593 --> 1:20:50.554
I wouldn't mind recreating it.

1:20:51.137 --> 1:20:52.138
<i>Jagi,</i>

1:20:52.222 --> 1:20:53.682
can you do something?

1:20:54.307 --> 1:20:55.517
Step a little closer to each other.

1:20:55.600 --> 1:20:57.602
-Kiss for the camera.
-But what's important is…

1:20:57.686 --> 1:20:59.354
Run on the count of three.

1:20:59.855 --> 1:21:01.314
-Got it.
-All right.

1:21:01.398 --> 1:21:02.732
One…

1:21:04.192 --> 1:21:05.193
Two…

1:21:05.902 --> 1:21:07.195
Three!

1:21:07.279 --> 1:21:08.238
Hye-jin!

1:21:08.321 --> 1:21:10.490
-Where are you going?
-Thanks, everyone!

1:21:11.283 --> 1:21:13.159
We'll take the rest ourselves!

1:21:13.910 --> 1:21:15.829
-But…
-We love you!

1:21:17.205 --> 1:21:18.623
Good luck!

1:21:18.707 --> 1:21:21.126
-Be happy, guys.
-Goodness.

1:21:21.209 --> 1:21:24.421
-It's too bad.
-Ju-ri, that can be you as well.

1:21:24.504 --> 1:21:25.714
Gosh.

1:21:26.882 --> 1:21:29.718
-I'm going to marry JUNE.
-Is that so?

1:21:40.729 --> 1:21:43.481
-I doubt they'll follow us up here.
-Of course.

1:21:43.565 --> 1:21:45.358
They all hate hiking up hills.

1:21:45.442 --> 1:21:47.152
I hate it too.

1:21:47.777 --> 1:21:51.239
-And I had to run in heels.
-You did well.

1:21:55.076 --> 1:21:56.494
<i>SUN-IM</i>

1:21:56.578 --> 1:21:59.247
"The Sun-im" is the name of this boat?

1:21:59.331 --> 1:22:01.166
-Yes.
-It's adorable.

1:22:01.249 --> 1:22:02.709
The Sun-im.

1:22:02.792 --> 1:22:04.920
-It sounds like someone's name.
-It is.

1:22:05.003 --> 1:22:05.962
My grandma's.

1:22:06.963 --> 1:22:08.924
Gosh. Was it named after your grandmother?

1:22:09.591 --> 1:22:11.259
I'm sorry about that.

1:22:12.594 --> 1:22:15.597
Your grandfather
must've been totally romantic.

1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:17.057
Couldn't you have learned from him?

1:22:17.641 --> 1:22:19.100
-What?
-This boat.

1:22:19.684 --> 1:22:21.645
If it was given to you
by your grandfather,

1:22:22.354 --> 1:22:25.607
could I write my name here
in small letters?

1:22:25.690 --> 1:22:26.733
No, you can't.

1:22:27.692 --> 1:22:30.904
I'll write it up front
in big bold letters.

1:22:33.657 --> 1:22:35.116
All right.

1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:39.788
I'll be at the front of the boat
making sure you have a clear path.

1:22:41.122 --> 1:22:43.917
The sea won't always
be this gentle though.

1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:48.421
We will be met with wind and waves.
And even typhoons will come our way.

1:22:48.505 --> 1:22:50.048
So what if we get soaked in rain?

1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:53.843
Who cares if the wind blows a bit…

1:22:54.552 --> 1:22:56.596
when we're in the same boat?

1:22:58.974 --> 1:22:59.975
Let's take a photo.

1:23:02.811 --> 1:23:04.521
Let's take it together, ma'am.

1:23:07.732 --> 1:23:09.693
-All right. Here we go.
-Hurry.

1:23:09.776 --> 1:23:11.569
There. One…

1:23:12.904 --> 1:23:14.114
Let me wind it up.

1:23:14.656 --> 1:23:16.616
-How will they turn out?
-It'll be great.

1:23:16.700 --> 1:23:20.328
Okay, here we go again.

1:23:21.246 --> 1:23:24.207
-Next will be the André Kim pose.
-The André Kim pose?

1:23:24.290 --> 1:23:26.001
We'll be able to nail this one.

1:23:26.084 --> 1:23:28.086
One, two…

1:23:30.714 --> 1:23:33.425
-Hold on. Let me get this call.
-Me too.

1:23:35.427 --> 1:23:36.636
-Hello?
-Hello?

1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:37.971
-What?
-What?

1:23:38.054 --> 1:23:39.931
-You tripped?
-You tore the inside of your mouth?

1:23:40.015 --> 1:23:41.057
-Where?
-Where?

1:23:42.892 --> 1:23:44.144
-Ms. Mat-i?
-Ms. Lee?

1:23:46.062 --> 1:23:47.313
Jeez.

1:25:09.938 --> 1:25:11.523
SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE DO-YEOP

1:26:30.977 --> 1:26:35.899
