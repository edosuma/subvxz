WEBVTT

00:10.400 --> 00:13.062
Do you, like, actually think
that I'm stalking you?

00:13.070 --> 00:14.162
I don't trust you.

00:14.170 --> 00:17.298
I need your help
tracking down
Jake Fitzgerald.

00:17.310 --> 00:19.175
The kid screwed me over.

00:19.180 --> 00:21.307
(Students cheering)

00:21.780 --> 00:23.714
(Students gasping, screaming)

00:23.720 --> 00:25.472
What if they think
one of us is the killer?

00:25.490 --> 00:27.310
Sta V0 basically
has ”crazy psychopath”

00:27.320 --> 00:28.480
tattooed on his foreheaaj

00:28.490 --> 00:29.809
and I'm supposed
to just ignore it?

00:29.820 --> 00:31.549
You're my favorite
person in the world,

00:31.560 --> 00:32.686
but you're acting weird.

00:32.690 --> 00:34.453
Hey, give that back!

00:34.460 --> 00:36.087
This is what he's drawing!

00:36.100 --> 00:37.124
God, you sicko!

00:37.130 --> 00:38.290
It's not what you think!

00:38.300 --> 00:39.824
(Students yelling)

00:51.280 --> 00:52.907
(Mouse, keyboard clicking)

00:52.910 --> 00:56.471
It's been one day
since Jake Fitzgerald's
body was found,

00:56.480 --> 01:01.281
and the grizzly reality
of how he died is settling in.

01:01.290 --> 01:03.451
That sort of grief
is a tricky thing.

01:03.460 --> 01:05.280
You don ’t know what to feel.

01:05.290 --> 01:08.384
Should you be furious?
Should you be frightened?

01:08.400 --> 01:09.628
Should you be sad?

01:09.630 --> 01:12.258
It can swallow you up
or weigh you down

01:12.270 --> 01:15.524
or ignite a fire inside you.

01:16.600 --> 01:20.036
When murder hits
this close to home...

01:21.240 --> 01:24.300
It makes you see the world
in a new way.

01:24.310 --> 01:25.299
People, too.

01:25.310 --> 01:29.349
Even the ones you trust start
to look a little different.

01:30.180 --> 01:33.217
Because when
everyone's a suspect,

01:33.220 --> 01:35.279
there is no innocence.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.130
(Phone ringing)

01:58.580 --> 02:00.673
(Ringing continues)

02:02.020 --> 02:04.545
What do you want?
Distorted voice:
You didn ’t tell anyone

02:04.550 --> 02:07.383
about our little
meeting yesterday.

02:07.390 --> 02:08.948
Sorry to disappoint you.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.416
Poor, sao; awful Emma.

02:10.420 --> 02:14.220
You can ’t trust anyone,
not even yourself

02:14.230 --> 02:15.356
You're wrong about that.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.918
You know I ’rn n'ght.

02:16.930 --> 02:18.352
I’m always right.

02:18.370 --> 02:19.325
Go to hell.

02:19.330 --> 02:23.391
I’m in your head; Emma,
and you know it.

02:26.270 --> 02:30.001
I'm sorry, she's not up yet.
I can wake her up
if it's important.

02:30.010 --> 02:33.548
No. No, it's okay.
I just need to talk to her.

02:33.550 --> 02:35.506
Could you tell her
i stopped by?
Sure.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.375
She's going through
a hard time right now.

02:38.390 --> 02:40.984
Just be patient with her.

02:40.990 --> 02:42.241
I will.

02:42.260 --> 02:44.285
That's good to know.

02:46.190 --> 02:48.329
I'm sorry, Emma.
I made a mistake.

02:48.330 --> 02:51.458
Telling him about the phone
without talking to you...

02:51.470 --> 02:53.495
It was wrong.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.991
Then, why did you do it?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.536
When acosta found
the gun in my locker,

02:57.540 --> 03:00.600
he said he'd arrest me
ifI didn't help him,

03:00.610 --> 03:02.737
ifI didn't give him an "in."

03:02.740 --> 03:05.470
And I was that "in"?

03:06.510 --> 03:08.307
You could have told me.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.619
I've been calling
all morning to tell you.

03:15.660 --> 03:18.379
You weren't
the only one who called.

03:18.390 --> 03:20.221
The killer called... again.

03:20.230 --> 03:22.528
What do you mean,
he called again?

03:22.530 --> 03:24.452
He called me this morning
and at the lockdown.

03:24.460 --> 03:28.419
Just like in the woods,
he was there, taunting me
through the window.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.658
Why didn't you tell anyone?
Who was I gonna tell?

03:30.670 --> 03:34.162
The sheriff so that he could
ask me about my PTSD again?

03:34.170 --> 03:35.728
Jake's body dropped
from the ceiling,

03:35.740 --> 03:39.176
and all he cared about
was my mental health history,

03:39.180 --> 03:41.375
which is exactly
what the killer wants.

03:41.380 --> 03:43.575
So, you made up
the panic attack.

03:43.580 --> 03:46.140
He's messing with me
and it's personal.

03:46.150 --> 03:51.417
I have to figure out
what's going on
and who I can trust.

03:56.260 --> 03:59.718
I can't believe
this is happening again.

04:02.770 --> 04:05.193
I can't believe
Jake is gone.

04:05.210 --> 04:07.030
Neither can I.

04:15.220 --> 04:18.417
(Knocking on door)
Emma: Hey, Noah.
It's me. Open up.

04:18.420 --> 04:22.789
Uh, hold on.
Just a second.

04:23.820 --> 04:26.380
Hey! Was that locked?
That's weird. Sorry.

04:26.390 --> 04:27.687
Uh, what's up?
What's going on?

04:27.690 --> 04:31.251
Um, I have something
i need to tell you.

04:33.770 --> 04:35.567
The last thing
that Piper said to me

04:35.570 --> 04:37.765
was that she had
one more surprise.

04:37.770 --> 04:39.635
I think that surprise
just killed Jake

04:39.640 --> 04:41.631
and is now
terrorlzmg all of us.

04:41.640 --> 04:42.834
You mean Piper's accomplice.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.774
Yes. I know. You've been
saying it all along,

04:44.780 --> 04:47.601
but, now, I'm ready
to know the truth.

04:47.610 --> 04:49.271
I need to see your board.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.747
The board? No, no, no!

04:50.750 --> 04:52.570
It's under construction.
It's not ready.

04:52.590 --> 04:56.549
You're not ready.
Nobody's ready.
Noah, I'm ready.

05:06.470 --> 05:09.769
Audrey? What?

05:10.470 --> 05:11.596
Why do you think that?

05:11.610 --> 05:13.464
Audrey said some strange things
during the lockdown.

05:13.470 --> 05:17.531
And then, she went
all Frankenstein
lynch mob on stavo,

05:17.540 --> 05:20.100
and-and she... she just...

05:20.110 --> 05:23.318
You know, her temper's been
off the charts lately.

05:23.320 --> 05:26.448
That's it? That's...
That's all that you have?

05:26.450 --> 05:30.386
It's just
a feeling I have.
A feeling?

05:30.390 --> 05:32.449
(Scoffs)

05:32.460 --> 05:34.428
It's not Audrey!

05:34.430 --> 05:38.389
Noah, the killer has gotten
in your head, okay?

05:38.400 --> 05:43.292
He... he wants you to connect
dots that don't even exist!
It is part of his game, okay?

05:43.300 --> 05:48.636
He is trying to make it
so that you cannot trust
anything or anyone.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.531
It could all be
a part of his plan. Yeah.

05:53.310 --> 05:55.141
It has to be.

05:58.450 --> 06:03.410
(Sighs)
It's Brooke. It's Brooke.
I have to go.

06:04.190 --> 06:09.924
It's not Audrey, so unless
you have something real
to back that up,

06:09.930 --> 06:14.424
you need to take down
her picture right now.

06:25.680 --> 06:29.241
Carnations are depressing af.

06:30.750 --> 06:34.481
(Sighs) How about you just
don't tell my dad about that?

06:34.490 --> 06:36.583
He'll just want to send me
to another shrink,

06:36.590 --> 06:39.479
and I'll just want
to butcher another bed.

06:39.490 --> 06:41.481
How are you holding up?

06:41.500 --> 06:43.354
I'm not.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.294
I realize Jake was no angel,

06:45.300 --> 06:48.861
but he didn't deserve
what Seth did to him.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.193
Brooke...

06:51.200 --> 06:54.363
I know that Seth Branson
IS not a good guy,

06:54.370 --> 06:55.632
but don't do that
to yourself.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.768
He was obsessed with me.
And not in the cool way.

06:58.780 --> 07:03.376
More, like, in the scary,
stalker-y, "doesn't want
to share me" kind of way.

07:03.380 --> 07:04.847
Jake tried to open
my eyes to that,

07:04.850 --> 07:07.614
and he wound up
dead at my feet.

07:08.690 --> 07:10.555
This is all my fault.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.484
Brooke, I know
you want answers,

07:15.500 --> 07:19.357
but don't go down
the Branson spiral.

07:19.370 --> 07:20.792
I don't think
it makes sense.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.768
You're really trying
to make sense

07:22.770 --> 07:24.761
out of any of this?

07:24.770 --> 07:26.863
Your long-lost
psycho half-sister

07:26.870 --> 07:28.269
tried to kill us all.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.498
I wouldn't really
call that logical,

07:30.510 --> 07:33.001
but, hey,
it totally happened.

07:33.010 --> 07:37.640
Yeah.
It could be anyone
this time, Emma.

07:38.420 --> 07:41.742
I have to find out
what happened to Jake.

07:41.760 --> 07:45.457
I don't care
how ugly it gets.

07:45.460 --> 07:46.927
Yeah.

07:48.930 --> 07:50.693
I'll see you later.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.554
Miguel: Ijust had
a few more questions.

07:52.570 --> 07:55.289
Quinn: Brooke is too fragile
for any more interviews
right now.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.564
Have you followed up
on Seth Branson?

07:57.570 --> 07:58.969
We did.
I appreciate the tip,

07:58.970 --> 08:01.564
but it looks like
he'll come out clean.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.005
What about Jake's phone?

08:05.550 --> 08:07.370
Couldn't open it.

08:07.380 --> 08:09.803
Encrypted.

08:29.540 --> 08:33.032
(Suspenseful music playing)

08:41.520 --> 08:43.875
You! Tell me
why you're tailing me
or I'll smack you again.

08:43.880 --> 08:47.543
This time for real.
Wait, that wasn't for real?

08:47.550 --> 08:49.518
Okay, look, no,
i was not following you.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.750
I mean, yeah,
i was following you, but...

08:51.760 --> 08:54.581
I tried to call you.
I lost my phone. Go on.

08:54.590 --> 08:56.023
So, I spotted you,
and I thought,

08:56.030 --> 08:58.021
"hey, follow her!
That'll be really funny."

08:58.030 --> 09:01.090
And, you know,
it obviously was not
'cause you hit me.

09:01.100 --> 09:03.591
And, now,
I'm on my way to...
Buy a bike,

09:03.600 --> 09:06.933
which I was actually
gonna ask you to come
with me to do, so...

09:06.940 --> 09:10.432
Which one do you like?
What are you into? Huh?

09:10.440 --> 09:11.771
You're being so weird.

09:11.780 --> 09:13.668
(Scoffs)
What? Because I want
to buy a bike?

09:13.680 --> 09:16.046
Uh, I don't think so.
Hey, check that out
in the back!

09:16.050 --> 09:18.848
That's really cool.
The blue one with
the chrome handle bars.

09:18.850 --> 09:22.980
That's pretty cool.
That looks good, right?
That looks cool.

09:22.990 --> 09:24.389
You know what?

09:24.390 --> 09:27.427
I'm gonna test ride it.
Thank you!

09:40.670 --> 09:42.001
(Knocking)

09:44.580 --> 09:46.138
Hey.
Hey, I got your text.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.072
And I got your text.
Who is Eddie?

09:48.080 --> 09:50.071
Eddie's the key
to clearing Audrey.
Check it out.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.548
Right here
in the transcript
of my morgue interview.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.609
Eddie saw Piper and a girl
matching Audrey's description

09:54.620 --> 09:56.508
together several times
at the motel where he works.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.580
So, he's seen Piper's
accomplice, butI bet you
he's never seen Audrey.

09:59.590 --> 10:03.822
When he doesn't
recognize Audrey, he'll prove
that she's not Piper's sidekick.

10:03.830 --> 10:06.958
Right? What do you think?

10:06.970 --> 10:09.689
Do it.
Okay.

10:09.700 --> 10:15.639
Uh... "Was this the girl
you saw with Piper?"

10:15.980 --> 10:17.572
Eddie shut me down
a couple of times.

10:17.580 --> 10:19.832
We'll just have
to wait it out,
bide our time.

10:19.850 --> 10:21.579
Okay.
We're on his clock now, so...

10:21.580 --> 10:24.970
Oh! That was fast, Eddie.
He says, "wow."

10:24.990 --> 10:29.017
Okay, that's not useful,
but we've got the three dots.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.612
There's hope!

10:31.020 --> 10:35.081
Emma: I bet you he will
not recognize Audrey.

10:39.970 --> 10:43.633
(Typing on phone)

11:03.490 --> 11:05.651
You don't_ have
to keep coming over.

11:10.030 --> 11:11.827
Woman:
Thank you, mayor.

11:15.470 --> 11:16.823
Mr. mayor!

11:17.500 --> 11:19.468
We met at the high school.

11:19.470 --> 11:23.679
(Sighing)
During the lockdown.
It was an emotional day.

11:23.680 --> 11:27.946
Buy me a drink
and I'll keep you company.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.558
Ugh! Jesus, you scared me.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.881
Wear a bell if you're
gonna creep like that.

11:39.890 --> 11:42.450
You texted me.
Twenty minutes ago.

11:42.460 --> 11:45.395
I drive a bike,
not a range rover.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.924
What's the emergency?

11:46.930 --> 11:49.797
Look, you were
a really great guide

11:49.800 --> 11:52.633
when I was lost
in that ayahuasca nightmare.

11:52.640 --> 11:53.800
So, I was wondering,

11:53.810 --> 11:57.007
do you have the same
sense of direction

11:57.010 --> 11:59.501
around your dad's office?

11:59.510 --> 12:00.647
What am I looking for?

12:00.650 --> 12:03.813
Anything that looks weird
in Seth Branson's file.

12:03.820 --> 12:06.778
You mean that lurker guy
who was at the movies

12:06.790 --> 12:08.087
that night you kissed me?

12:08.090 --> 12:10.650
You kissed me, dude!
(Scoffs)

12:10.660 --> 12:14.426
Focus!
Can you help me or not?

12:14.430 --> 12:16.057
Cake walk.

12:28.810 --> 12:30.607
You ready?

12:42.760 --> 12:48.027
So, yeah, sometimes,
they'd use my place
to meet up. For privacy.

12:48.030 --> 12:50.123
Thanks.
That's really helpful.

12:50.130 --> 12:52.598
I'm telling you
what I know.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.727
Tell me about
your girlfriend.

12:54.730 --> 12:57.528
I already told you
about the phone.

12:59.470 --> 13:01.006
You have an opportunity
here, Kieran.

13:01.010 --> 13:04.468
An opportunity to not
make the same mistakes.
Mistakes?

13:04.480 --> 13:08.871
If you kids had been
a little bit more forthcoming
with law enforcement last time,

13:08.880 --> 13:10.177
your father might
still be alive.

13:10.180 --> 13:13.069
(Scoffs)
Come on. I saw you
looking at his picture.

13:13.090 --> 13:15.513
Don't tell me that thought
hadn't crossed your mind.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.579
You had to bring him
into this!

13:21.460 --> 13:24.452
(Door opening, slamming)

13:25.500 --> 13:26.819
(Sighs)

13:28.640 --> 13:32.838
(Sighs)
You asked for weird,
i found weird.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.159
They think
Jake's time of death

13:34.170 --> 13:37.469
was late Sunday night,
early Monday morning.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.903
Branson has an alibi
for the whole night.

13:39.910 --> 13:41.639
(Drumming on legs)

13:41.650 --> 13:42.605
Kristin lang.

13:42.620 --> 13:44.645
Our psych teacher?

13:44.650 --> 13:46.845
Ew. The one who wears
all the blazers?

13:46.850 --> 13:50.513
Gets weirder. The file says
lang and Branson are dating.

13:50.520 --> 13:53.717
(Scoffs) Okay, that makes
a hundred percent no sense.

13:53.730 --> 13:55.755
I know. She's his age.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.022
(Sighs)

13:57.030 --> 13:59.794
I bet blazer babe
is covering for him.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.791
I'm gonna get
to the bottom of it.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.028
Just promise me something.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.962
I know, I know.
Don't get involved.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.699
Whatever.
Screw that!

14:06.710 --> 14:11.602
Promise you'll take no prisoners
and kick ass as needed.

14:18.620 --> 14:20.212
_ How much
dId you say it was?

14:20.220 --> 14:21.949
Give me a sec.

14:33.100 --> 14:36.991
(Suspenseful music playing)

14:37.000 --> 14:38.831
Looks like
you're upgrade eligible.

14:38.840 --> 14:43.129
Um, never mind.
I don't need a new phone.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.831
Emma:
Why are we meeting Eddie
at the far'rgrounds?

14:46.850 --> 14:49.842
He moonlights there as a guard.
We need to swing by my house.

14:49.850 --> 14:52.239
I want to pick up a flashlight
and some bolt cutters.

14:52.250 --> 14:55.117
Bolt cutters?
Yeah. It's always good
to be prepared.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.587
Maggie:
Prepared for what?

14:56.590 --> 15:00.754
Oh, uh, we're just doing
an interview for Noah's podcast.

15:03.130 --> 15:04.825
I'd love to have you
on it sometime.

15:04.830 --> 15:07.993
(Chuckles)
We still don't know
what happened to Jake,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.730
so you're not going
anywhere tonight.

15:10.740 --> 15:12.594
That's final.

15:16.080 --> 15:19.106
This could be really bad.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.207
Go ahead, take a look.

15:23.220 --> 15:25.142
I don't need to.

15:25.150 --> 15:26.617
I think you do.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.588
You owe me that.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.633
It's a comic book.

15:44.640 --> 15:45.664
Graphic novel.

15:45.670 --> 15:46.967
Operative word
being "graphic."

15:46.970 --> 15:49.734
I'm trying to tell
the story of murderville,

15:49.740 --> 15:53.631
and the truth is, it gets
a little bloody in parts.

15:55.650 --> 15:59.973
Your stuff is good.
Twisted but good.

15:59.990 --> 16:01.639
Caravaggio, goya...

16:01.650 --> 16:08.249
Their paintings were bloody
and disturbing but beautiful.

16:08.260 --> 16:09.784
Even murder can be art.

16:09.800 --> 16:14.794
It's too soon, man.
Look, whoever killed Jake
had a vision.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.791
Black Dahlia,
Jack the ripper...

16:16.800 --> 16:19.189
They staged their kills
to tell a story.

16:19.210 --> 16:21.166
They controlled
the narrative.

16:22.940 --> 16:26.307
Interesting.
I know what you're doing.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.206
What I'm doing?

16:29.220 --> 16:31.814
Being nice,
complimenting me...

16:31.820 --> 16:35.312
But, deep down,
you still suspect me.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.689
If that's what
you think I'm doing,

16:39.690 --> 16:41.885
why are you
showing me your stuff?

16:41.890 --> 16:46.054
Because maybe
I'm doing the same.

16:53.010 --> 16:56.332
(Footsteps approaching)

16:57.010 --> 16:57.999
Brooke...

16:58.010 --> 16:59.329
I came as quick
as I could.

16:59.350 --> 17:00.999
Thank you
for meeting me, Ms. lang.

17:01.010 --> 17:05.310
Of course.
I'm happy to be there
for all of my students,

17:05.320 --> 17:06.947
especially after
what happened with Jake.

17:06.950 --> 17:09.748
I know you two had
a special relationship.

17:09.760 --> 17:13.184
Yeah, well,
this isn't about Jake.

17:13.190 --> 17:16.819
Not entirely, at least.

17:16.830 --> 17:18.024
Ijust...

17:18.030 --> 17:19.327
Well, I know
you're really good

17:19.330 --> 17:21.195
at all of this personal
psychology stuff,

17:21.200 --> 17:24.328
so I thought maybe you could
help me out with this.

17:27.170 --> 17:28.432
I...

17:28.440 --> 17:32.900
was with another man
the night that Jake died.

17:34.780 --> 17:37.340
Iwas with Mr. Branson.

17:37.980 --> 17:41.381
And I'm just feeling
really guilty about it.

17:42.890 --> 17:44.187
Seth Branson?

17:44.190 --> 17:47.159
I'm sure you know
our history.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.185
Except, it's not history.

17:49.200 --> 17:53.489
I... I slept with Seth
on Sunday night,

17:53.500 --> 17:59.166
which... is the night
that they think Jake died.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.239
I'm just...

18:01.240 --> 18:04.107
I'm an awful person,
aren't I?

18:06.210 --> 18:09.441
(Sobbing)

18:13.090 --> 18:16.082
Hey, you reached Seth.
Please leave a message.

18:16.090 --> 18:19.184
Seth, call me!
We need to talk!

18:19.530 --> 18:22.090
I'm falling apart, Seth.

18:22.100 --> 18:26.321
I need someone.
I need you.

18:26.330 --> 18:27.467
I’m here, baby.

18:27.470 --> 18:30.394
I don't want to feel
this paIn anymore.

18:30.400 --> 18:36.100
I need to escape...
Like we used to.

18:36.110 --> 18:37.930
You mean. ..

18:37.940 --> 18:39.976
Meet me at our old spot?

18:39.980 --> 18:41.845
You sure?

18:41.850 --> 18:43.147
Yeah.

18:46.350 --> 18:49.319
Awfully big
for just the two of you.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.481
Oh, after my wife
and I separated,

18:51.490 --> 18:54.254
I thought about downsizing,

18:54.260 --> 19:00.221
but I decided
to upsize instead.

19:15.880 --> 19:19.839
I'm afraid you have
the wrong idea.

19:20.850 --> 19:23.546
Then, what am I doing here?

19:23.560 --> 19:25.983
I saw something in you.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.981
What was that?

19:27.990 --> 19:29.218
Desperation.

19:29.230 --> 19:36.329
I have an off-the-books job
that recently became available.

19:37.570 --> 19:39.265
You interested?

19:49.550 --> 19:51.245
(Car beeps)

20:00.060 --> 20:01.357
(Engine starts)

20:01.360 --> 20:05.296
(On radio)
even as we wake up

20:05.300 --> 20:07.427
even as we wake...

20:07.430 --> 20:09.159
(banging)

20:20.950 --> 20:24.169
(Suspenseful music playing)

20:33.290 --> 20:36.259
Come on, Noah,
pick up your phone.

20:47.470 --> 20:50.268
No service? Awesome.

21:09.100 --> 21:10.419
Eddie?

21:15.400 --> 21:18.369
Bud... I'm here.

21:19.170 --> 21:21.559
Hello?

21:25.340 --> 21:27.171
Eddie...

21:27.750 --> 21:29.570
Where you at, buddy?

21:32.250 --> 21:35.117
(Breathing heavily)

21:42.030 --> 21:43.383
Eddie...

21:53.470 --> 21:57.429
Come on, man.
Come on, Eddie.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.238
(Suspenseful music playing)

22:05.550 --> 22:09.008
No, no.
No way. No way.

22:11.290 --> 22:12.757
No. No way.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.524
Yeah, that'll be cool.
I'll even go alone.

22:15.530 --> 22:20.297
I'm a moron! You need
to chill out, foster.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.188
And stop talking
to yourself!

22:22.200 --> 22:28.036
(Grunting, muffled screaming)

22:38.850 --> 22:41.512
(Takes deep breath)

22:45.020 --> 22:49.127
Woman:
don ’t say it
don ’t you say it

22:49.130 --> 22:52.691
one breath,
it’ll just break it

22:52.700 --> 22:56.591
so shut your mouth
and run me Me a river

22:56.600 --> 23:00.866
shut your mouth, baby,
stand and deliver

23:00.870 --> 23:04.806
holy hands,
oh, they make me a sinner

23:04.810 --> 23:07.870
hire a river,
hire a river

23:07.880 --> 23:10.599
what are you doing?
shut your mouth and...

23:10.620 --> 23:12.918
come on, Brooke, baby.
Baby, wait.
(Giggling)

23:12.920 --> 23:15.741
Choke this love ﬁll
the veins start to shiver

23:15.760 --> 23:20.959
one last breath 177/
the tears start to wither

23:20.960 --> 23:23.849
hire a river,
hire a river

23:23.860 --> 23:28.627
shut your mouth
and run me Me a river

23:28.630 --> 23:29.597
(music stops)

23:29.600 --> 23:31.022
Playtime's over, bitch.

23:31.040 --> 23:36.865
I know your alibi
for Jake's murder is b.S.

23:37.940 --> 23:39.737
Where were you
on Sunday night?

23:39.750 --> 23:42.241
I didn't kill
your meathead boyfriend.

23:43.050 --> 23:44.074
Jesus, Brooke!

23:44.080 --> 23:46.674
Don't talk about him
like that.

23:46.690 --> 23:48.840
Where were you
Sunday night?

23:48.850 --> 23:51.489
(Screaming)

23:51.490 --> 23:52.514
Okay, fine!

23:52.530 --> 23:54.521
I wasn't with Kristin
on Sunday night, okay?

23:54.530 --> 23:57.795
I lied about my alibi.
There, you happy?
Why would you lie?

23:57.800 --> 24:01.668
If I said where I really was,
it would sound even worse.

24:01.670 --> 24:02.694
Where were you?

24:02.700 --> 24:05.237
I was here...
Waiting for Jake.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.801
What? _
Your boytoy was paying me
to leave lakewood.

24:08.810 --> 24:10.801
He wanted me
out of your life.

24:10.810 --> 24:12.903
He was supposed to come.
He never showed.

24:12.910 --> 24:16.949
Jake was doing that?
For me? (Chuckles)

24:18.180 --> 24:20.045
What an idiot.

24:20.850 --> 24:22.283
How much was I worth?

24:22.290 --> 24:23.689
Ten grand.
(Scoffs)

24:23.690 --> 24:26.750
And where was Jake gonna get
that kind of money, huh?

24:26.760 --> 24:28.227
His parents kept tabs
on all of his cards.

24:28.230 --> 24:31.927
I don't know, okay?
He said he had some sort
of deal with your dad.

24:31.930 --> 24:34.148
Lie. They couldn't
stand each other.

24:34.170 --> 24:35.819
I don't know.
Okay, Brooke?

24:35.840 --> 24:37.228
Money, no money,
you know me.

24:37.240 --> 24:40.994
I'm a lot of things,
but I'm not a killer.

24:41.010 --> 24:42.068
Oh, really?

24:42.070 --> 24:44.061
Should we ask
your last girlfriend?

24:44.080 --> 24:46.969
I didn't murder Caitlyn, okay?
No, you just changed your name

24:46.980 --> 24:50.302
and moved to another city
to ruin another girl's life.

24:50.320 --> 24:55.110
Caitlyn was disturbed.
I didn't take her suicidal
threats seriously.

24:55.120 --> 24:58.681
I made a mistake.
You make a lot of mistakes.

24:58.690 --> 25:01.557
And you tell a lot of lies.

25:02.230 --> 25:03.959
I think it's time
you learned your lesson.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.155
You can't do this, Brooke.
You can't do this!

25:06.170 --> 25:11.563
Why not? Worst case,
i get community service
and probation.

25:12.100 --> 25:13.738
Victimized high school student

25:13.740 --> 25:16.265
lured_ to hotel
by a serial predator.

25:16.280 --> 25:17.759
You're
crazyl

25:17.780 --> 25:19.133
Confess to killing Jake

25:19.140 --> 25:21.870
or say good-bye
to "little Branson."

25:21.880 --> 25:29.241
(Muffled screaming)
Three... two... one.

25:33.590 --> 25:35.649
Jk. Now, I believe you,

25:35.660 --> 25:38.254
and you get to keep
all of your man parts.

25:38.260 --> 25:39.249
Win-win.

25:39.270 --> 25:41.693
(Breathing heavily)

25:47.610 --> 25:53.037
(Muffled yelling)

25:54.380 --> 25:57.269
I never want_
to see you again.

25:59.790 --> 26:00.848
Enjoy your stay.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.181
(Muffled)
Brooke!

26:02.190 --> 26:05.978
Audrey? Really?
I know it's crazy.

26:05.990 --> 26:08.823
Which is why, if Eddie has
anything that can clear her,

26:08.830 --> 26:10.320
I have to go.

26:10.330 --> 26:11.820
Hey, don't worry.

26:11.830 --> 26:13.923
Worried is exactly
what I should be.

26:13.930 --> 26:16.194
You should call the cops.
No. No! Wait.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.738
Not until I have something real.
I thought you understood that.

26:19.740 --> 26:22.800
I do. It'sjust...
I can't help thinking,

26:22.810 --> 26:25.335
if we'd been_
more open last time,

26:25.340 --> 26:28.309
maybe my dad
would still be alive.

26:28.310 --> 26:30.642
Promise me you won't go.

26:30.650 --> 26:32.811
It's not safe.

26:34.950 --> 26:36.315
Okay.

26:37.420 --> 26:39.251
I won't go.

26:40.290 --> 26:41.951
All right.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.191
(Engine starts)

27:01.210 --> 27:04.338
(Electronic music playing)

27:13.930 --> 27:15.682
(Knocking on door)

27:17.200 --> 27:18.849
Hello? Who is it?

27:18.860 --> 27:20.259
It's Brooke.

27:21.170 --> 27:22.819
(Music stops)

27:24.240 --> 27:25.832
You're early.

27:27.340 --> 27:29.103
Consider a shirt.

27:29.740 --> 27:33.699
Or don't.
It's a good vibe for you.

27:35.010 --> 27:36.898
How'd it go with lang?

27:38.150 --> 27:41.745
I was right
about her and Branson.

27:41.750 --> 27:46.050
Things got
a little dark and twisty.

27:46.060 --> 27:49.951
I don't know. I guess
i just didn't know
i had that in me.

27:50.430 --> 27:54.457
You feel any better?
Not really.

27:55.230 --> 27:59.735
I don't know what I thought
was gonna happen, but...

27:59.740 --> 28:01.401
Jake's gone.

28:02.740 --> 28:04.799
That's not changing.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.853
(Breathing heavily)

28:31.300 --> 28:32.995
No, no, no!

28:33.010 --> 28:36.366
No! No! Help!

28:36.380 --> 28:39.338
Help! Help!

28:39.340 --> 28:43.879
(Suspenseful music playing)

28:43.880 --> 28:45.939
(Groans)

28:48.220 --> 28:51.781
Oh, god! Audrey!
What's going on?

28:51.790 --> 28:55.556
I was parked in the alley
behind the grindhouse
and something...

28:55.560 --> 28:59.098
Shh! They could be here.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.821
They could be watching us.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.229
This is bad.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.561
Multiple kidnapping
is a common storyline

29:06.570 --> 29:08.106
in the torture porn subgenre.

29:08.110 --> 29:11.978
Usually, only one captive
survives, and sometimes...

29:15.380 --> 29:16.369
Sometimes what?

29:16.380 --> 29:19.577
Sometimes, nobody survives.

29:22.960 --> 29:25.178
I see some tools.

29:25.190 --> 29:27.988
(Grunting)
It's just out of my reach.

29:27.990 --> 29:29.878
_ He wants it to be
just out of my reach.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.993
It's part of his
torture fetish.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.197
Come on, foster.
Almost there. You got this.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.138
Oh, god!

29:44.210 --> 29:47.577
Horror movie logic says
we're about to die.

29:48.150 --> 29:50.243
Real world logic, too.

29:52.250 --> 29:55.378
Only thing left is
to tell the truth.

29:58.860 --> 30:01.158
I stole your phone.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.025
I saw everything.

30:03.030 --> 30:05.055
Your texts
from the killer.

30:05.060 --> 30:07.995
Even the gif of you
with Jake's dead body.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.265
I wanted to tell you
about it. I did...

30:12.140 --> 30:15.860
The killer lured me
to Jake's body
and got that video,

30:15.870 --> 30:18.009
and then, he had me.
I was completely screwed.

30:18.010 --> 30:19.898
How could I tell
anybody about that?

30:19.910 --> 30:21.070
You could have told me!

30:21.080 --> 30:25.039
Of all people,
I'm the one you tell!

30:26.920 --> 30:29.309
But you didn't.
And now, here we are,

30:29.320 --> 30:32.551
tied up,
in an Eli roth movie.

30:32.560 --> 30:35.222
This whole thing
is so
saw ii.

30:35.230 --> 30:38.358
Please don't make me
cutoff a body part!

30:48.940 --> 30:50.498
Noah?

30:53.680 --> 30:55.307
Oh, come on.

30:58.550 --> 31:00.313
(Sighs)

31:02.450 --> 31:04.111
Noah!

31:15.630 --> 31:19.361
(Suspenseful music playing)

31:19.370 --> 31:20.997
Noah?

31:33.950 --> 31:36.111
Before I meet my maker,

31:36.120 --> 31:38.179
I've got some things
i want to confess.

31:38.190 --> 31:43.651
I don't like my cat.
We've never gotten along.

31:43.660 --> 31:46.493
I wish I'd learned
to play an instrument,
probably saxophone.

31:46.500 --> 31:49.594
I told Riley
that my favorite movie
was
Terminator.
It's not.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.137
Its
psycho.
But that's not what you
tell a girl on a first date.

31:52.140 --> 31:55.564
Wow. Okay.
_ Somewhere int/me _
IS my second favorite mowe.

31:55.570 --> 31:58.471
Terminator
_ IS not _
even In the top fIve.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.675
Okay, okay.

32:02.050 --> 32:03.506
There's more.

32:03.520 --> 32:05.875
Lakewood sucked
before I met you.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.518
So, when we kissed...

32:07.520 --> 32:09.249
No, no, no...

32:09.250 --> 32:11.855
When we kissed...

32:12.490 --> 32:15.220
It made me feel something.

32:16.090 --> 32:20.652
I think I'd always kind of
wanted to kiss you.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.929
and I know I'm an idiot
for even saying...

32:23.940 --> 32:28.092
No, no, no. You're not.
You're not at all.

32:30.210 --> 32:36.206
I do love you, Noah,
just... not like that.

32:36.850 --> 32:41.844
I get it. I just wanted to be
honest about it, before...

32:41.850 --> 32:45.149
(Chuckles)
You know.

32:47.630 --> 32:48.949
Is this my fault?

32:48.960 --> 32:52.691
Us here, making
deathbed confessions?

32:52.700 --> 32:55.225
This is not your fault.

32:55.230 --> 32:57.698
If we get out of this alive,
I'm burning my murderboard

32:57.700 --> 32:59.565
and I'm selling
all my podcast equipment.

32:59.570 --> 33:01.936
You love your murderboard.
It's what you do.

33:01.940 --> 33:03.703
It's who you are.

33:04.710 --> 33:06.234
I'm so sorry, Audrey.

33:06.240 --> 33:07.878
Don't be.

33:13.120 --> 33:16.817
Noah, there's something
i need to tell you. Truth is...

33:16.820 --> 33:18.708
Emma:
Noah!

33:20.590 --> 33:21.955
Hello?

33:34.740 --> 33:36.560
That's Emma! Emma!

33:36.580 --> 33:37.865
Hey, wait, wait, wait!

33:37.880 --> 33:39.279
Noah, shut up!
Why is Emma here?

33:39.280 --> 33:42.147
We were supposed
to meet up with Eddie
from the Crescent palms.

33:42.150 --> 33:45.039
No, no, no!
There is no Eddie!
Eddie is dead!

33:45.050 --> 33:47.348
Eddie can't be dead.
He texted me this morning.

33:47.350 --> 33:49.045
He is dead!
He is super dead!

33:49.050 --> 33:51.018
The killer must have
lured you here posing as him.

33:51.020 --> 33:52.783
We are sitting ducks.
I am so confused.

33:52.790 --> 33:55.156
Haven't we been sitting ducks
this whole time?

33:55.160 --> 33:56.923
Not exactly.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.729
You have some
explaining to do.

34:00.730 --> 34:02.288
Look, I followed you here.

34:02.300 --> 34:05.030
I kidnapped us.
Not the killer. Me!

34:05.040 --> 34:06.894
You were starting
to suspect me,

34:06.910 --> 34:08.605
and so I ﬁgured
if I got kidnapped,

34:08.610 --> 34:10.908
you'd know
that I was not the killer.

34:10.910 --> 34:12.332
Makes sense, I guess.

34:12.340 --> 34:14.638
But, now, the killer
might really be here

34:14.650 --> 34:16.242
and we might really
be screwed.

34:16.250 --> 34:17.649
This is really confusing.

34:17.650 --> 34:19.845
Just promise me you won't
tell Emma anything

34:19.850 --> 34:22.785
until I get a chance
to explain myself.

34:22.790 --> 34:24.678
Good enough. Come on!

34:27.160 --> 34:29.924
(Suspenseful music playing)

34:51.850 --> 34:53.408
(Metal scraping)

35:01.760 --> 35:03.159
(All screaming)
Emma, thank god.

35:03.160 --> 35:06.049
The killer is here!
I was wrong about everything.
It was a trap.

35:06.060 --> 35:08.927
I know. We have to get
the hell out of here.

35:11.970 --> 35:15.064
You guys, what's going on?
Kieran, what are you
doing here?

35:15.070 --> 35:16.901
I was worried.
I followed you.
That's odd.

35:16.910 --> 35:19.003
Let's do this _
when we're not running
from the killer.

35:19.010 --> 35:21.228
The killer was here?
He might still be.

35:21.250 --> 35:23.070
Let's get out of here!

35:45.040 --> 35:47.998
Thanks for making sure
i got home okay.

35:48.910 --> 35:50.639
You lied to me, Emma.

35:50.640 --> 35:53.734
You said you wouldn't go
and you went anyway.

35:53.750 --> 35:56.901
No, i-i didn't lie.
I changed my mind.

35:56.920 --> 36:00.879
Going there tonight
made no sense.

36:00.890 --> 36:03.984
I asked you to trust me.

36:03.990 --> 36:05.787
So, trust me.

36:05.790 --> 36:07.917
I have to figure this out,

36:07.930 --> 36:10.956
and I really need you
to understand that.

36:14.070 --> 36:15.697
I do.

36:46.100 --> 36:48.398
(Sighs)
Excuse me, sir.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.823
Your Phoenix tech buddies
got us an ip address

36:50.840 --> 36:56.062
for those emails Kevin duval got
from that dead girl Riley marra.

36:57.010 --> 36:58.739
(Exhales)

37:00.050 --> 37:01.972
The emails came
from Emma duval?

37:01.980 --> 37:04.847
Crazy, huh?
You actually believe that?

37:04.850 --> 37:08.445
After what
this town's been through,
anything could happen.

37:08.450 --> 37:11.248
It could be anyone.
Anyone could snap.

37:11.260 --> 37:12.113
Thanks.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.054
You're welcome.

37:14.060 --> 37:16.085
(Sighs)

37:22.870 --> 37:24.428
We need to talk.

37:24.440 --> 37:26.362
It's about Emma.

37:27.170 --> 37:31.266
Testing, testing.
Welcome to the morgue.

37:35.780 --> 37:38.271
Ithought
you were going home.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.975
I was...

37:39.990 --> 37:42.015
But if I don't tell you
this tonight,

37:42.020 --> 37:44.045
I may never be able to.

37:47.860 --> 37:49.384
Okay, go.

37:58.170 --> 38:01.936
I know why
the killer is after me.

38:01.940 --> 38:05.273
He knows what I've done
and that I would do anything

38:05.280 --> 38:07.134
to keep it secret.

38:16.020 --> 38:18.488
I brought Piper to lakewood.

38:19.220 --> 38:26.058
I was so alone
and-and-and pissed
at the world, so...

38:26.060 --> 38:27.994
I found Piper.

38:29.030 --> 38:30.395
I wrote her letters.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.789
I begged her to come
to lakewood and...

38:32.800 --> 38:36.236
Help me research
for a documentary
about Brandon James.

38:36.240 --> 38:42.099
The thing about Brandon is,
he may have looked different,
but he wasn't a monster.

38:42.110 --> 38:46.319
He was like me. He was alone,
rejected, and angry.

38:46.320 --> 38:50.017
It was lakewood
that turned him
Into a monster.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.211
When people started dying,

38:52.220 --> 38:55.018
Piper swore to me
that it wasn't her,

38:55.030 --> 38:57.783
and I believed her,
and now...

38:58.830 --> 39:01.799
Now, I'm paying
for my mistakes...

39:03.030 --> 39:05.123
for all that blood.

39:09.470 --> 39:11.404
I deserve this.

39:20.950 --> 39:25.011
If you believe that,
then Piper and this sicko win.

39:27.290 --> 39:31.488
You're not a monster, Audrey.
You're a victim.

39:39.870 --> 39:42.862
Promise me
you won't tell Emma.

39:42.870 --> 39:45.168
I need to be
the one to do it.

39:51.350 --> 39:55.389
(Door opening, closing)
(Muffled)
Brooke? Brooke!

39:55.390 --> 39:58.018
(Muffled chatter)

39:59.620 --> 40:02.054
(Muffled screaming)

40:15.540 --> 40:19.078
(Muffled whimpering, yelling)

40:19.510 --> 40:23.503
(Muffled yelling)

40:23.520 --> 40:26.614
(Muffled screaming)

40:29.020 --> 40:31.011
(Screaming continues)

40:47.170 --> 40:49.104
(Iron dings)

41:05.460 --> 41:10.227
(Screaming)
