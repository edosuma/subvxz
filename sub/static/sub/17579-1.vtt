...it's good but
Penn is the place to be.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.477
I like Northwestern.

00:38.520 --> 00:42.149
We shall be arriving
at Altoona in about 15 minutes.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.431
On your right
is Rockview Correctional Institution,

00:45.480 --> 00:48.074
one of the largest prisons
in Pennsylvania.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.396
...today you need
a BA and a Masters degree.

01:10.680 --> 01:13.717
Altoona, Pennsylvania.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.672
Get out your baggage checks
for Altoona.

01:35.720 --> 01:39.508
...the obligation of placing
in his home the Holy Scriptures

01:39.560 --> 01:43.633
and provide him with instructions
in the Christian faith.

01:43.680 --> 01:47.355
As Thomas grows in years,
do you Frankie, as godmother,

01:47.400 --> 01:51.916
and you, William, as godfather,
promise to fulfil these obligations?

01:53.480 --> 01:58.235
Then, by the power vested in me,
I baptise you Thomas.

01:58.280 --> 02:02.637
In the name of the Father, the Son...

02:02.680 --> 02:06.992
Michael! Stop shooting,
you're making the minister crazy.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.031
I'm outta here!

02:10.240 --> 02:12.754
By the power vested in me
by this state,

02:12.800 --> 02:15.075
I declare you released from custody.

02:15.120 --> 02:18.908
- You're a free man.
- Thank you, Master Lincoln.

02:18.960 --> 02:22.589
Try to stay out at least a year.
Good luck, Johnny.

02:22.640 --> 02:26.076
- Thank you, Mr Rosen.
- You're the best cook here.

02:26.120 --> 02:28.998
I sincerely pray
I'll never see you again.

02:29.040 --> 02:32.828
- I'll miss your omelettes!
- I'll send you the recipe.

02:34.520 --> 02:38.149
New York City can be
a real dangerous, hostile place.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.191
It'll be a nice change.

02:41.240 --> 02:44.391
New beginning for you men,
make the most of it.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.829
Come back and cook for us, Johnny!

02:48.280 --> 02:53.308
Delaney! I'm in, I'm out
I'm out! Out!

02:55.160 --> 02:57.435
Nice thought, Lester!

02:59.000 --> 03:01.070
Fresh air.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.190
We're really free.

03:15.440 --> 03:19.877
It was a beautiful christening.
Thanks for letting us use your house.

03:19.920 --> 03:23.549
I love babies. Now, I don't have
any grandchildren...

03:23.600 --> 03:25.477
Don't start, Mum.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.876
Would you stop cleaning and sit down?
Come on.

03:35.160 --> 03:39.153
This is the way people live, Frances.
Real people.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.235
- What time's your bus?
- Late.

03:42.280 --> 03:45.078
I want to spend some time with her.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.237
- Now it's my fault!
- Nothing's your fault.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.350
It was a lovely ceremony.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.439
- You wanna try it again?
- One more time.

03:54.480 --> 03:57.517
- No!
- Please! Yes, one more time.

03:57.560 --> 04:01.348
- Great christening, honey.
- Gotta go. Bye, Frankie.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.231
I better get going.

04:07.040 --> 04:10.077
Baby, I worry about you in New York.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.270
I'm fine, Mum.

04:17.360 --> 04:21.433
Maybe I'm not the happiest person
who ever lived...

04:21.480 --> 04:23.516
but that's not your fault.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.115
Welcome to New York, you sinners.

06:16.160 --> 06:19.675
This city is filled with sinners,
we don't need any more,

06:19.720 --> 06:23.235
but you could be saved if
you follow the word of the Lord.

06:23.280 --> 06:27.353
Will you follow? The Lord
can save you. Do you wanna be saved?

06:27.400 --> 06:31.951
Do you? You must choose your way
today, brothers and sisters.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.389
Do you hear me? You must choose...

06:34.440 --> 06:37.910
Leo! Meet me at the corner.
Thank you.

Sale

06:56.680 --> 06:58.671
Cabbie! Taxi!

07:07.080 --> 07:09.116
- What are you doing?
- Helen's sick.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.550
They're sending her home.
I don't know what's the matter.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.237
Do you want water?
Nedda, get me some water, please.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.271
You're going to be OK.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.914
- I'm fine.
- I'll tell you when you're fine.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.428
- What's wrong?
- He's sending me home.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.835
Twice in one week?
Dizzy spells, not good.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.632
It's my medication.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.035
- Nick, I got a cab.
- Good.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.913
Here's $10 for the cab,
you take Helen home.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.554
- What about me?
- You take the bus.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.716
I'll call you this afternoon.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.877
That woman at table five
stiffed me last week.

07:41.920 --> 07:45.515
OK, thanks for telling me.
I'll burn her toast.

07:47.240 --> 07:52.109
I tell her to stop working so hard,
now she tells me that she's fine.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.151
She doesn't look so fine to me.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.479
She's been waiting on me
for ten years.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.034
No wonder she's sick.

08:02.080 --> 08:06.517
What are you talking about?
You know that nice dress...

08:06.560 --> 08:08.437
Not so much butter!

08:08.480 --> 08:12.075
I say this much, why you use
that much? Get off the phone.

08:12.120 --> 08:15.874
In a minute, Tino.
Listen, baby, as soon I...

08:15.920 --> 08:20.038
- Don't tie that thing up all day.
- Luther, who's gonna call you?

08:20.080 --> 08:22.435
Scrambled with sausage, home fries

08:22.480 --> 08:25.040
and a gun
to shoot that bitch on three.

08:25.080 --> 08:29.995
- How was your weekend?
- It was great. I saw my mum...

08:30.040 --> 08:31.917
Where's my bacon?

08:31.960 --> 08:35.350
I'm backed up. Help me
and get lover boy off the phone.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.791
...that underwear I bought you.
- Jorge, hi! Lmmigration!

08:42.159 --> 08:44.355
No, I was just kidding!

08:47.880 --> 08:50.474
OK, here we go.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.071
Good morning, Frankie.

08:54.120 --> 08:58.557
There you go. Sorry it took so long
but Tino's real backed up.

09:00.440 --> 09:04.592
Walt learned to juggle oranges,
he thinks it gives him vitamin C.

09:04.640 --> 09:09.111
Hi, we have two specials today. We
have a feta cheese omelette for 3.95

09:09.160 --> 09:11.594
and a western omelette for 2.95.

09:11.640 --> 09:16.395
- I'll take the pancake special.
- No, there are no special pancakes.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.908
There's the feta and the western.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.748
I'll have the French toast special
with double syrup.

09:23.800 --> 09:27.713
- My goodness! Did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw it.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.830
I'm all right, don't worry.

09:29.880 --> 09:34.795
Look what you did! My father
had to work very hard for this car.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.798
- Get her off!
- Poke him in the eye!

09:37.840 --> 09:41.958
...when you give them change,
they say, "No, I give you 20."

09:42.000 --> 09:45.310
I bring you from Greece
to teach you business.

09:45.360 --> 09:48.397
- I try, Uncle Nick.
- You can sit anywhere.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.635
Go on, take any table. Once again.

09:50.680 --> 09:54.389
No, it says you looking
for a short-order cook.

09:54.440 --> 09:57.637
We're always looking for cooks
but they come and they go.

09:57.680 --> 10:01.150
I'm not a come-and-go guy.
I'll stick with you if you hire me.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.191
I like your hair like that.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.710
- You don't think it's too young?
- No, it's perfect.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.671
- See the guy on two?
- The cop?

10:08.720 --> 10:11.518
Wants chopsticks. Where's my bacon?

10:11.560 --> 10:14.154
My references,
signed by the governor.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.198
- More like a diploma.
- Excuse me.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.470
- Sorry.
- Peter, phone call.

10:20.520 --> 10:24.195
This chopstick has tape on it,
you can't be that cheap.

10:24.240 --> 10:27.630
- The other one is good.
- One chopstick?

10:27.680 --> 10:30.558
You want me to sharpen it
and have him stab the food?

10:30.600 --> 10:35.833
Good idea. So, what do you think,
pookie? You think I should hire him?

10:38.360 --> 10:40.351
- Yes.
- Why?

10:40.400 --> 10:44.518
- I like his face.
- Me, too. You're hired.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.468
Thank you, sir. Really, thank you.

10:48.520 --> 10:51.671
- OK. You wanna know why? Ask me why.
- Why?

10:51.720 --> 10:55.554
I believe in giving men
another chance. Close your ears.

10:56.760 --> 11:01.038
Until he fucks up.
This country gave me another chance.

11:01.080 --> 11:04.277
Close your ears, pookie.
I didn't fuck up.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.754
- This is between us.
- Thank you.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.439
I won't... Could you close your ears?

11:11.440 --> 11:13.795
I won't fuck up.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.753
Here. Fill this out,
you bring back tomorrow, all right?

11:18.680 --> 11:21.274
- You start tomorrow, 6am.
- I can start now.

11:21.320 --> 11:24.835
Tomorrow's good.
I'm Nick, you're Johnny?

11:24.880 --> 11:27.952
- How'd you hurt your hand?
- Soccer. You play soccer?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.833
- No. I play handball, though.
- OK, tomorrow.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.872
Nice you meeting, pookie.
I'll see you at six.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.958
- Got a job today!
- Who gives a shit?

11:43.520 --> 11:45.556
The head is ten points.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.750
How much for the belly button?

11:49.680 --> 11:53.070
Man! Winner! One more.
You know what I'm saying.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.839
Stop playing and get out of here.
Come on.

11:55.880 --> 11:59.555
You took away our playgrounds
now you take away our stiffs.

11:59.600 --> 12:04.116
Guy comes out of the garage,
gets in his car and gets shot.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.955
Hello? How are my shelves?

12:37.040 --> 12:40.555
- I'm a friend of Tim's. I'm Bobby.
- Where's Tim?

12:41.600 --> 12:44.478
He's in his place.
You were out of beer.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.239
- Nice elephant collection.
- Thanks.

12:48.280 --> 12:52.398
He asked me to help
with your shelves. You like 'em?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.510
A little crooked but... yeah.

12:55.560 --> 12:58.279
The shelves aren't crooked.
It's your floor.

12:59.280 --> 13:03.751
There she is! There's the
little godmother. Welcome home.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.791
Have you met Bobby?

13:08.120 --> 13:10.190
We met at a Dr Pepper audition.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.471
He was the big pepper,
I was the little pepper.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.317
Hands on buzzers.

13:16.360 --> 13:19.318
Acrophobia is the fear
of high places,

13:19.360 --> 13:21.828
agoraphobia is the fear
of open spaces,

13:21.880 --> 13:25.156
but what are you afraid of
if you're xenophobic?

13:25.200 --> 13:26.792
Foreigners.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.037
- Foreigners.
- Foreigners or strangers. Correct!

13:30.080 --> 13:33.595
Lucy, this is Bobby.
He'll be taking you for your walk.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.950
She likes to chase Limos.
She has delusions of grandeur.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.595
I know how to walk a dog.
We do have these things in Kentucky.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.790
Kentucky! I'm dating Huck Finn!

13:42.840 --> 13:46.196
- Nice to meet you, Frankie.
- You too, Big Pepper.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.828
So, have I found Shangri-La?

13:49.880 --> 13:52.838
- He's nice.
- That's a rotten thing to say.

13:54.440 --> 13:57.159
He's very nice!
What do you want me to say?

13:57.200 --> 13:59.998
I leave you alone for two seconds...

14:00.040 --> 14:03.510
I know. I said I'd never
fall in love again.

14:03.560 --> 14:06.552
- Where did that get me?
- Don't get dramatic.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.670
It's an occupational hazard.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.790
I love watching TV with you,

14:11.840 --> 14:14.832
I hope we'll best friends
the rest of our lives

14:14.880 --> 14:19.112
but there's a whole world out there,
it's no use pretending there's not

14:19.160 --> 14:22.550
just because our feelings got hurt
or there's some virus.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.591
I know.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.031
But I'm going for a VCR.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.475
A VCR. I hope it comes
with a lot of attachments.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.990
- Is that a life?
- Send out for a pizza, rent a film.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.837
That's dinner and a movie

14:37.880 --> 14:42.271
and I don't have to deal with some
schmuck putting his tongue in my ear.

14:43.560 --> 14:47.599
What is the topic of discussion
when lepidopterists get together?

14:47.640 --> 14:49.232
Butterflies.

14:49.280 --> 14:53.034
- Gems?
- No, ma'am. Butterflies or moths.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.959
You've been to college,
you should know that.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.871
I'm fine.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.991
I'm fine.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.552
Give her a kiss.
Give her a nice kiss.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.231
Want some bran?

15:34.280 --> 15:37.670
May as well just eat rope
and yank it through.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.870
Come on!

15:40.520 --> 15:43.398
You have feet, you have shoes! Run!

15:45.560 --> 15:48.438
Papa! Are you OK?

15:48.480 --> 15:51.358
- What's happening?
- Don't poke! Please.

15:53.800 --> 15:57.588
Hi, are you buying? I'm on sale.
I'll pay you Thursday.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.757
How you doing?

16:01.800 --> 16:03.950
Hi. Looking for company?

16:04.000 --> 16:07.993
- I don't know. What's the rate now?
- $100. Cash.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.271
I appreciate the offer
but that's a little out of my...

16:11.320 --> 16:13.914
Listen, it's slow tonight.
We can talk.

16:13.960 --> 16:17.589
- You wanna talk? OK, let's...
- So, what do you like?

16:17.640 --> 16:20.438
What about the spoon position?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.313
What you gonna do to me
in the spoon position?

16:24.360 --> 16:26.396
Party time.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.432
- Celeste, no...
- Christine.

16:30.680 --> 16:33.717
Yeah, well, clothes on.
You know what I mean?

16:36.200 --> 16:38.634
Clothes on, spoon position.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.830
I will go on with dynamite.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.678
People got to be able to see
as well as hear.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.075
Watch this, I'll do Bette Davis...

17:19.680 --> 17:23.309
You all right, man.
That's like a move, ain't it?

17:24.880 --> 17:27.916
All right! Chop that celery!

17:27.960 --> 17:31.555
- That's a good way to lose a finger.
- Do it, baby.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.797
I had a cousin, he lost two fingers
at his last job.

17:34.840 --> 17:37.638
- He can't even tie his own shoes.
- Come on!

17:37.680 --> 17:40.717
- I wear loafers anyway.
- Frankie, come here.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.679
Look at this guy, he's a hot dog.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.757
He's cute, though.
He's got a cute little ass.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.349
- Why don't you tell him?
- I think I will. Hey, Zorro!

17:52.200 --> 17:55.033
Anybody ever tell you
you got a cute ass?

17:55.080 --> 17:57.469
- Last job I had.
- Are you blushing?

17:57.520 --> 18:02.071
Stop bothering the new guy.
Everybody get to work for a change.

18:02.120 --> 18:06.716
Scrambled with bacon, two easy-overs
with sausage and a Belgian waffle.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.275
I'm Johnny. Who are you?

18:12.320 --> 18:15.790
These eggs aren't runny.
Mr DeLeon likes them runny.

18:15.840 --> 18:18.513
They look runny to me.
They're pretty runny.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.638
- He's a regular.
- Who can argue with that?

18:22.680 --> 18:24.716
And who can argue with you?

18:24.760 --> 18:29.072
"Thy head is full of quarrel
like an egg is full of meat."

18:29.120 --> 18:31.873
Romeo and Juliet. I'm reading it now.

18:33.200 --> 18:36.431
Act three, scene one.
I can't find it now.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.471
OK, raw eggs coming up.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.435
Not raw, runny.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.355
Wait a minute. Stop!

18:56.040 --> 18:58.634
Nick, the pie machine's gone berserk.

19:00.200 --> 19:03.317
Look, if he jumps, he jumps
but they never do.

19:03.360 --> 19:06.079
I gotta go, I'll call you later.
Yeah, bye.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.590
- What do you think of him?
- Who?

19:14.640 --> 19:17.757
- The guy. The new guy.
- He just started, Cora.

19:17.800 --> 19:21.156
I've been checking him out.
Something about him I don't like.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.316
I know what you mean. Some wise guy.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.316
No, it's the headband.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.238
- He is cute.
- You always see something cute.

19:28.280 --> 19:31.192
- I'm lucky like that.
- Is Helen still out?

19:31.240 --> 19:33.037
She'll be back tomorrow.

19:33.080 --> 19:36.356
You know what your problem is?
You're too picky.

19:36.400 --> 19:40.393
Women like that always have
opinions about women like us.

19:42.120 --> 19:45.032
- How do those look?
- Perfect!

19:45.080 --> 19:49.278
You girls take such good care of me.
I know, I should have said ladies!

19:51.040 --> 19:53.156
No, you should have said women.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.033
Frankie, you're looking at
a very old dog.

19:56.080 --> 19:59.470
In my time I've said tootsies,
dolls, gals, chicks, babes,

19:59.520 --> 20:02.637
sometimes even broads -
that's when I was a young man.

20:02.680 --> 20:06.958
When I was a young man,
the wonder-drug was Mercurochrome.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.913
Did I tell you my daughter-in-law
wants me to call her Ms?

20:10.960 --> 20:13.918
I put up with her
because of my grandchildren.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.951
Have I shown you pictures of them?

20:16.000 --> 20:19.879
Want to see them again?
Some of them are out of focus.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.516
Peter, telephone.

20:25.560 --> 20:28.996
How can VCRs be so complicated?

20:30.080 --> 20:33.072
- What's his story?
- Ask Cora.

20:33.120 --> 20:36.430
She after him already? She's fast!

20:36.480 --> 20:39.119
Like a bullet!

20:39.160 --> 20:41.151
Maybe Jorge knows about VCRs.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.760
That boy?
All he got on his mind is pussy.

20:45.760 --> 20:49.389
You open his head,
you'll find little hairy triangles.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.830
Frankie, come here.

20:55.640 --> 21:00.077
The professor from the college just
stuck his hand up my skirt again.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.315
OK. You pour, I'll bump.

21:06.760 --> 21:10.275
- Let me freshen that up for you.
- I always like more.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.311
It's very cold.

21:12.360 --> 21:15.591
I am so sorry! Are you all right?

21:15.640 --> 21:17.631
I'm so sorry.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.551
Helen's in the hospital.

21:28.600 --> 21:32.309
Her neighbour just called.
She thinks this is it.

21:34.520 --> 21:37.432
15 years she works here.
It's a long time.

21:49.160 --> 21:52.152
Do you think she knows we're here?

21:54.360 --> 21:56.351
I don't know.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.951
It's a hospital.

22:05.560 --> 22:08.791
Helen, honey, it's Cora.
Can you hear me?

22:09.840 --> 22:13.150
Excuse me. Could you leave now?
Helen has another visitor.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.191
We're leaving.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.793
We're gonna go now.
We'll be back tomorrow.

22:27.560 --> 22:31.678
Do you think we're gonna
end up like this? Alone.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.111
She's not alone.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.511
She's alone.

23:17.080 --> 23:21.073
Easy. We'll need something under
his head. Let me have your jacket.

23:22.880 --> 23:25.235
Back off, OK? Give him a little room.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.511
- It's not like your father's...
- What's going on?

23:28.560 --> 23:30.835
- Where's Nick?
- At the hospital.

23:30.880 --> 23:33.394
- What's wrong?
- He's having a fit.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.237
Call an ambulance.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.555
- I love...
- What is wrong with you?

23:37.600 --> 23:39.272
That's my girlfriend!

23:39.320 --> 23:43.393
He's just sitting there,
then he falls like a ton of bricks.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.396
Stand back.

23:45.440 --> 23:50.116
We need an ambulance, please. The
Apollo restaurant, 23rd and Ninth.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.879
Is there a doctor here?

23:52.920 --> 23:55.150
Is anybody a doctor here?

23:55.200 --> 23:59.113
- You're dressed like a nurse.
- I'm a dental technician.

23:59.160 --> 24:02.436
- We're gonna need an ambulance.
- They're on the way.

24:02.480 --> 24:06.314
You gotta get him on his side
so he can breathe right.

24:06.360 --> 24:08.351
Where did you learn that?

24:08.400 --> 24:11.710
Campfire Girl...
I don't remember. Is he epileptic?

24:12.640 --> 24:15.313
- Yeah, I think...
- Sure? It could be drugs.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.955
Drugs? He don't look like
an addict to me. What is it?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.797
Epilepsy!

24:20.840 --> 24:25.197
Yeah, he's epileptic.
Go back to your tables, he's fine.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.629
The ambulance is coming. Thank you.

24:27.680 --> 24:31.150
Thanks for cooperating.
Free coffee for everyone.

24:31.200 --> 24:34.192
- Give everyone...
- Nick'll kill you.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.629
You can make that call now, Jorge.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.956
Your name is Frankie, right?

24:41.000 --> 24:42.991
- I'm Johnny.
- I know.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.076
Frankie And Johnny, the song.

24:45.120 --> 24:48.476
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Is he breathing all right?

24:48.520 --> 24:51.637
Yeah. Frankie and Johnny
were sweethearts...

24:51.680 --> 24:55.229
- I don't think he's breathing right.
- He's breathing.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.635
- Why not go out with me tonight?
- What?

24:58.360 --> 25:01.033
I'm asking you out with me tonight,
on a date.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.790
He just asked her out.

25:03.840 --> 25:06.912
- I don't believe this.
- What's not to believe?

25:06.960 --> 25:10.270
No. Keep him company.
I'll wait for the ambulance.

25:13.120 --> 25:16.351
- Welcome to the world.
- What happened?

25:16.400 --> 25:20.313
Nothing much. I just got
turned down by some woman.

25:20.360 --> 25:22.351
You're gonna be fine.

25:34.520 --> 25:36.431
Hey, Lucy.

27:50.080 --> 27:53.072
I'm actually in Rego Park.

28:02.320 --> 28:04.595
Look who's here.

28:08.760 --> 28:11.558
What's he doing here?
He didn't know her.

28:11.600 --> 28:14.876
Sure he did. His first day
was her last... I think.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.514
Helen can use all the mourners
she can get.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.869
- Nedda!
- I didn't mean it unkindly,

28:19.920 --> 28:22.559
I'm just glad
we didn't book St Patrick's.

28:22.600 --> 28:26.115
Tino and Luther were here earlier,
Nick got the flowers.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.435
- They're nice.
- I gotta go.

28:28.480 --> 28:32.075
I'm gonna go with you.
Funerals give me the willies.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.554
- You gonna come?
- We just got here.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.990
- It's the thought.
- I don't wanna leave her alone.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.991
Yeah, sure.

28:47.920 --> 28:51.799
Come on, Nedda, we don't need
a brick wall to fall on us.

28:51.840 --> 28:54.195
Shut up, don't be ridiculous.

28:55.240 --> 28:59.074
You're picking up a guy
in a funeral parlour

28:59.120 --> 29:01.998
in front of a freakin' stiff!

29:02.040 --> 29:05.555
In my wildest dreams
I didn't do anything like that.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.795
Blow it out your ass.

29:10.160 --> 29:12.037
Charming.

29:16.840 --> 29:18.876
Sorry, Helen.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.715
Who do I have to fuck
to get a waffle?

30:15.560 --> 30:17.357
Forget about the waffle.

30:18.440 --> 30:21.512
Thank you, Tino,
Oscar's a lot better.

30:21.560 --> 30:25.917
Hot plates, look out. Here's another
present for you, Luther.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.910
Can I ask you something?

30:35.960 --> 30:38.155
Yeah, shoot.

30:40.600 --> 30:43.398
Tino, give me a moment here.
Thank you.

30:45.160 --> 30:48.357
- I'll clean that later.
- Did you know Helen?

30:48.400 --> 30:52.109
- It looked like you were crying.
- Death is very sad.

30:53.680 --> 30:55.671
But you didn't even know her.

30:55.720 --> 31:00.191
You don't have to know someone to
feel sad for them. It's empathy.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.310
Yeah. Empathy, yeah.

31:02.360 --> 31:06.148
Empathy. The sympathetic vibrations
of two human beings.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.760
- I know what it means.
- No, you don't.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.519
I didn't know either
till I looked it up.

31:11.560 --> 31:15.348
You see, every day when I'm shaving,
I look up a new word.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.398
It's a little piece of turkey,
that's all.

31:22.440 --> 31:25.750
How can you have empathy
with someone you've never met?

31:25.800 --> 31:31.113
I didn't have to meet her. I just
looked at her picture and I knew.

31:32.040 --> 31:35.510
I knew she lived alone,
I knew she had these dreams

31:35.560 --> 31:38.870
that weren't quite enough
to keep her heart beating

31:38.920 --> 31:42.469
so she kept it going by
putting a bottle of Four Roses

31:42.520 --> 31:45.114
under her pillow - nobody knew about.

31:46.840 --> 31:49.035
Vodka.

31:49.080 --> 31:53.631
You should get a crystal ball and a
turban, you'd make a lot more money.

31:53.680 --> 31:58.435
I'm no fortune teller.
I just tell it the way I see it.

31:58.480 --> 32:03.395
She had that look. My mother
had that look her whole life.

32:03.440 --> 32:05.112
Disappointed.

32:06.160 --> 32:09.311
I need a blood sausage
and hash browns.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.669
Nedda! She's just asking me out!

32:11.720 --> 32:14.598
I am not! I am not asking you out.

32:17.200 --> 32:21.751
- I'm sorry I'm interrupting.
- You're slicing the turkey too thin!

32:27.200 --> 32:29.270
That's OK, I'll wait.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.838
Baby, you know
how I feel about you, right?

32:39.880 --> 32:41.950
Don't monopolise the phone.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.711
Thank you, Cora.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.030
Did you come?

33:43.080 --> 33:46.356
Yes. I usually
can hold it longer than that.

33:49.040 --> 33:52.510
- Sorry.
- But it didn't seem like you came.

33:55.440 --> 34:00.195
I came. I did. That was terrific.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.956
Are you sure?

34:04.000 --> 34:06.878
Are you kidding? Of course I did.

34:06.920 --> 34:10.993
Yeah, but usually a guy will moan
and yell or something,

34:11.040 --> 34:13.554
you didn't even clear your throat.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.955
I trained myself to do it quietly.

34:18.159 --> 34:22.915
- Why?
- Let's just say I've been in places

34:22.960 --> 34:27.670
where full-throated orgasm
would be highly inappropriate.

34:27.719 --> 34:31.507
- You mean like a monastery?
- Yeah, sort of.

34:34.920 --> 34:37.070
I'm dizzy.

34:39.239 --> 34:42.550
Maybe the shoes
was too much for you.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.591
It could have been.

34:44.639 --> 34:47.108
- Or position maybe.
- Position! Yes!

34:48.159 --> 34:51.469
I like that position.
Woman astride. Yes.

34:51.520 --> 34:55.399
Why didn't you say something?
I would have done it.

34:56.440 --> 34:59.796
You did it.
That's what this is, astride.

35:01.520 --> 35:04.512
- What, on top?
- Yeah, on top. Like this.

35:09.720 --> 35:12.075
Though my lips were sealed,

35:12.120 --> 35:16.113
my mind and my body
were just shooting off fireworks.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.434
So, it wasn't exactly perfect.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.711
Don't worry about it.

35:31.560 --> 35:36.998
I wasn't exactly 100% - these shoes
are cute but they kill my feet.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.231
Can I stay over?

35:44.720 --> 35:46.711
Why not?

35:46.760 --> 35:50.753
Because if you stay over, the two
of us will lay here all night, awake,

35:50.800 --> 35:54.509
pretending to be asleep but
wondering why we didn't hit it off.

35:55.560 --> 36:00.156
Johnny, you're just lonely.
I'm just lonely.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.874
We don't have to be Romeo and Juliet.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.191
Lonely.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.955
You got a boyfriend, you said.

36:15.160 --> 36:19.392
I got two boyfriends.
I'm looking for one Mr Right.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.356
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- See you at the salt mines.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.470
- Bye.
- Good night.

36:41.120 --> 36:44.157
- It's not the end of the world.
- I know.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.589
I seen the end of the world.

36:57.960 --> 37:01.999
"But look, the morn,
in russet mantle clad

37:02.040 --> 37:06.431
"Walks o'er the dew
of yon high eastward hill."

37:06.480 --> 37:09.836
- The morn?
- What the hell does it mean?

37:09.880 --> 37:11.950
It means the sun is up.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.197
Why doesn't he just say so
instead of this bullshit?

37:15.240 --> 37:18.516
Because he's Shakespeare.
The greatest poet ever.

37:19.160 --> 37:21.754
Are you saying
you don't respect me any more?

37:21.800 --> 37:25.110
- I could care less!
- I don't respect you any more.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.435
I think you're both a pair of tramps.

37:27.480 --> 37:30.677
Look, I did you both a favour,
I tried him out.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.991
Did he really...?

37:35.440 --> 37:38.159
Two minutes tops!

37:38.200 --> 37:41.590
- I hate that!
- And so quiet. Like a mouse.

37:41.640 --> 37:44.518
Marcel Marceau
comes louder than this guy.

37:44.560 --> 37:48.030
Maybe you scared him.
That isn't out of the question.

37:48.080 --> 37:50.913
Well, maybe so
but I don't read poetry.

37:50.960 --> 37:54.077
As I see it, you need two words
to make it in this town -

37:54.120 --> 37:56.111
"fuck" and "you".

37:56.160 --> 38:00.278
- Someone didn't get laid last night.
- I get laid every night.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.276
I bet you do.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.876
- No, not the wig!
- No! I knew not to use the wig.

38:06.920 --> 38:10.993
Do you know those gold pumps I got?
The stilettos? I put 'em on,

38:11.040 --> 38:13.713
things are looking good,
but then I...

38:20.680 --> 38:22.830
I know what you two
are talking about.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.677
- You do?
- Of course I do.

38:24.720 --> 38:27.314
What are we talking about?
Say the word.

38:27.360 --> 38:30.432
- Leave her alone.
- Just one time. Just for me.

38:30.480 --> 38:34.553
- Copulate. Say it.
- Cora, leave her alone.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.273
- Once in your life.
- You are so mean!

38:37.320 --> 38:41.199
You can do it! On the count of three.
One, two, three!

38:41.240 --> 38:43.231
I watch Dr Ruth.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.511
Peter, telephone.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.835
Yeah. How much?

38:54.280 --> 38:56.077
What's with you?

38:59.360 --> 39:02.875
Ladies and gentlemen, staff,
I have an announcement.

39:02.920 --> 39:06.833
- Crazy busboy.
- I sold my first script.

39:06.880 --> 39:10.077
Right! They're flying me
first class to sunny LA

39:10.120 --> 39:12.680
to begin shooting Bloods On The Moon!

39:13.720 --> 39:16.518
I'll give you one last day
and I'm off to Hollywood.

39:32.720 --> 39:35.075
Son of a bitch! Pardon my French.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.910
Nice shot.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.758
OK, serving for the game,
this is it.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.036
I got you now! Go, Joe!

39:47.080 --> 39:49.719
Shit! Pardon my French.

39:53.480 --> 39:56.313
- Out!
- There it is, good game. Good game.

39:56.360 --> 39:59.716
- Good one, Joe.
- I gotta go catch criminals.

40:06.320 --> 40:09.790
Why won't you go to
Peter's going-away party with me?

40:11.000 --> 40:13.833
- I don't want to.
- I'll pick you up at seven.

40:13.880 --> 40:17.555
- Sometimes you're really obnoxious.
- I'm not obnoxious.

40:17.600 --> 40:21.434
I'm just eager to go out with you.
That's a big difference.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.869
545 West 54th Street, right?

40:24.800 --> 40:27.712
- How do you know that?
- Come on, it's on your punchcard.

40:27.760 --> 40:31.878
What are you doing looking at
my punchcard? You stay away from it.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.036
What's your apartment number?

40:38.280 --> 40:40.874
- 6A.
- No, I don't believe you.

40:51.480 --> 40:54.472
6B? 3F? Am I close?

40:54.520 --> 40:57.717
- Am I talking to myself over here?
- Just a minute.

40:57.760 --> 41:01.799
What can I do to make you respond
to me? Can I write little notes?

41:01.840 --> 41:03.910
I don't respond to little notes.

41:03.960 --> 41:07.509
- What about if I give you presents?
- You can afford that?

41:07.560 --> 41:11.269
- I'm saying little.
- I don't like presents and things.

41:11.320 --> 41:15.518
I know, I gonna back off
but I gotta tell you something.

41:15.560 --> 41:18.996
- I got a crush on you.
- Burger Deluxe, pick up.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.511
Why do you want to go out with me?

41:22.560 --> 41:25.358
Because the heart does things
for reasons

41:25.400 --> 41:27.789
that reason cannot understand.

41:27.840 --> 41:30.877
Does Nick know about this?
I'm gonna tell Nick.

41:30.920 --> 41:34.390
You got her jealous, you see?
You got her all riled up.

41:34.440 --> 41:37.398
I want to know why
you want to go out with me.

41:37.440 --> 41:40.955
We're gonna go to the party
and walk in alone?

41:41.000 --> 41:43.389
Our whole life
we spend alone at parties.

41:43.440 --> 41:47.115
So we walk in together,
it's not so bad. So bad?

41:49.440 --> 41:52.000
No, it's not. We can do it.

41:53.040 --> 41:56.555
- What? Do what?
- What's the matter?

41:56.600 --> 41:59.319
I don't even remember
what my order was!

41:59.360 --> 42:03.433
One meatloaf platter
and two chef's salads.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.471
See? I never forget an order.

42:06.520 --> 42:10.559
Cancel the tuna melt, the customer
just died of malnutrition.

42:10.600 --> 42:13.319
I'm giving his lawyer
your number, OK?

42:29.000 --> 42:32.436
Try something a little more festive.
You need these?

42:33.080 --> 42:34.957
No, not yet.

42:36.880 --> 42:39.553
I'm too old for this shit.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.477
Come on.

42:44.280 --> 42:48.637
- You look like an Italian widow.
- I wish you'd just come with me.

42:48.680 --> 42:52.559
I can't. I've cancelled this dinner
three times already.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.670
I hate going to parties alone.

42:54.720 --> 42:57.712
I always feel like
everybody's staring at me.

42:57.760 --> 43:01.912
Dressed in that they probably are.
What time is the bullfight?

43:01.960 --> 43:04.110
Let me weave my magic spell.

43:06.440 --> 43:10.069
The land of lost dresses.
And the winner is...!

43:11.880 --> 43:16.192
There. Now that is a party dress.
I feel prettier already.

43:16.240 --> 43:19.835
If you don't want to go
to parties alone, start dating again.

43:19.880 --> 43:23.509
She hasn't had a date in three years.
Not since Phillip...

43:23.560 --> 43:26.711
- I said the "Ph" word.
- It's not true.

43:26.760 --> 43:29.991
What about that Welshman?
I dated him that whole summer.

43:30.040 --> 43:32.031
Please! I don't count him.

43:32.080 --> 43:34.674
What? He asked me to marry him.

43:34.720 --> 43:38.872
That's why I didn't like him.
I knew he wouldn't leave his wife.

43:38.920 --> 43:41.275
What do you know about those things?

43:41.320 --> 43:44.471
- More than you do obviously.
- She doesn't have to date.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.590
I don't date by choice.

43:46.640 --> 43:49.029
Too bad because I love your choices.

43:49.080 --> 43:51.640
We went from Mr Abuse You
to Mr Use You,

43:51.680 --> 43:55.798
plus a fling with a cross dresser
that I blew the whistle on.

44:00.240 --> 44:05.030
Yes! Mama, the pumps. Definitely
the pumps. Bobby, what do you think?

44:05.080 --> 44:08.755
- Leave me out of it.
- I'm giving us six weeks.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.790
Are you expecting someone?

44:16.480 --> 44:18.471
Hello, who is it?

44:21.920 --> 44:25.230
I just got goosebumps.
Do you know that song?

44:27.040 --> 44:28.758
Four weeks.

44:28.800 --> 44:33.271
It says your name but it doesn't
say the apartment number.

44:33.320 --> 44:37.199
- 6A. What?
- It's the new guy at work. The cook.

44:37.240 --> 44:39.595
- Is he cute?
- Yeah, sort of.

44:39.640 --> 44:42.757
Do you have a date with him
or did you order sandwiches?

44:42.800 --> 44:45.872
No, he asked me to go out with him
and I told him no

44:45.920 --> 44:49.390
then he asked me to Peter's party
and I said no, I think.

44:49.440 --> 44:51.476
What did I say?

44:51.520 --> 44:55.115
How should I know? Who cares?
It's a gentleman caller.

44:57.120 --> 45:00.317
What did he do? Run up?
This guy means business.

45:00.360 --> 45:02.351
- Should I get it?
- Wait!

45:03.160 --> 45:04.957
Who are you gonna say you are?

45:05.000 --> 45:09.516
The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance!
What's wrong with you? How do I look?

45:09.560 --> 45:12.996
- I'm supposed to say that!
- Yeah, but you never do.

45:15.080 --> 45:17.594
My God! I look like the Breck girl.

45:21.320 --> 45:23.470
- This is 6A, right?
- 6A.

45:23.520 --> 45:25.715
- Welcome.
- Hello.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.389
- Are you OK?
- My God!

45:30.520 --> 45:32.988
- Can I get you something?
- I'm fine.

45:33.800 --> 45:35.950
I just ran up five flights.

45:37.160 --> 45:40.789
I don't know what got into me,
I just had to run up.

45:40.840 --> 45:44.116
- Wanted to get here.
- You didn't have to do that.

45:44.160 --> 45:46.310
No, it was my pleasure.

45:48.400 --> 45:50.391
- So, you ready?
- Almost.

45:50.440 --> 45:51.998
Yeah? Good.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.600
Nice apartment. Big for a studio.

45:55.760 --> 46:00.436
OK, sit. I guess there's
not an empty chair in the house.

46:04.480 --> 46:07.836
Man, I couldn't figure out
what to wear either.

46:14.480 --> 46:18.439
This is Tim and Bobby,
they're hooking up my VCR.

46:18.480 --> 46:20.277
Right.

46:22.400 --> 46:25.233
I'm Tim, he's Bobby.
I live across the hall

46:25.280 --> 46:28.272
and Bobby lives with
the Von Trapp family.

46:29.600 --> 46:31.750
So, this is your first date?

46:34.480 --> 46:36.675
We just started dating ourselves.

46:39.640 --> 46:42.029
Each other?

46:44.680 --> 46:47.717
That's interesting.
You'd never know it.

46:56.320 --> 47:00.438
This is really nice and homey.
Elephants!

47:00.480 --> 47:03.074
She's collected those
since she was kid.

47:03.120 --> 47:06.192
When the trunks are up,
it means good luck.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.310
But they gotta face the window.

47:09.640 --> 47:12.837
Otherwise it's bad luck.
I read that somewhere.

47:12.880 --> 47:15.269
That explains a lot.

47:18.680 --> 47:21.240
I think I could help you
with that wire.

47:21.280 --> 47:25.876
I think I got it if I could just...
Sure you know what you're doing?

47:25.920 --> 47:28.957
Last time I worked on one of these...

47:30.000 --> 47:32.230
OK, I think
that one goes right there.

47:32.280 --> 47:35.352
- I'm sure.
- No, it goes over here.

47:37.240 --> 47:39.754
You gotta take the plug...

47:39.800 --> 47:42.951
- Are you an electrician?
- No, I'm a cook.

47:45.240 --> 47:48.357
This is so exciting.
I feel like your big sister.

47:49.400 --> 47:52.551
- What do you think?
- He's nice.

47:53.560 --> 47:55.994
That's a rotten thing to say!

47:56.040 --> 47:59.271
He's very nice.
Look, we've both done worse.

48:00.320 --> 48:03.630
Of course, he could be
a mass murderer or a psycho.

48:03.680 --> 48:05.955
Thank you for sharing that with me.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.037
Come on,
hurry up before he changes his mind.

48:09.080 --> 48:11.275
It's better the way I had it.

48:11.320 --> 48:13.311
Yeah, I think you're right.

48:13.360 --> 48:16.955
Maybe I should just learn to leave
well enough alone.

48:17.920 --> 48:21.196
Let me help you. Here. Try this.

48:24.960 --> 48:27.599
I have a cousin who's gay,
by the way.

48:32.240 --> 48:34.800
- Most people do.
- Ready?

48:34.840 --> 48:37.434
- He's a really great guy.
- I'm sure.

48:37.480 --> 48:41.393
He just found out he was gay
a couple of months ago.

48:41.440 --> 48:44.910
I'll look him up in the directory.
Under the new listings.

48:45.960 --> 48:48.394
- Let's go.
- Good one.

48:48.440 --> 48:52.115
Nice meeting you. Nice meeting you,
Bobby. Sorry about the TV.

48:52.160 --> 48:54.913
- Don't worry about.
- Nice meeting you.

48:54.960 --> 48:58.191
- Sure you don't wanna come?
- Next week we'll double.

48:59.360 --> 49:01.351
I hope it works out.

49:28.720 --> 49:32.679
There's lots of reasons. At work, the
little things you do that I watch.

49:35.400 --> 49:37.595
I love the way you swig.

49:40.760 --> 49:43.149
You don't think we'd fit, do you?

49:46.280 --> 49:51.070
We fit, Frankie. We fit like...

49:52.960 --> 49:57.636
peas in a pod, like a lock and a key.

49:59.720 --> 50:02.757
I'm not so sure I like
where your key's been.

50:05.960 --> 50:10.750
You mean Cora, right?
You think that was something?

50:11.960 --> 50:14.315
Come on, you know what that was.

50:15.480 --> 50:18.040
It's a Band-Aid on loneliness.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.794
So, how old are you?

50:31.840 --> 50:36.118
None of your business.
How old are you?

50:38.160 --> 50:40.151
What do you think?

50:45.560 --> 50:47.551
Late forties.

50:48.600 --> 50:52.229
- What? Then don't ask.
- Don't ask!

50:52.280 --> 50:54.271
...but before I go any further,

50:54.320 --> 50:57.630
I'd like to introduce you all
to my heart, Cheryl.

50:58.680 --> 51:02.878
And the man this couldn't have
happened without, Mutzie Calish.

51:04.520 --> 51:07.637
Finally, to all of you
who helped me when I was a nobody,

51:07.680 --> 51:09.671
I'd like to thank you all now

51:09.720 --> 51:13.429
because I'm sure I will forget you
when I'm big and in Hollywood!

51:13.480 --> 51:15.835
I have something to say.

51:16.880 --> 51:21.078
I wish to make salute to Peter.
He worked for me at the Apollo Cafe.

51:22.520 --> 51:25.796
For Peter, my cousins
will play some Greek music.

51:28.320 --> 51:30.356
Let's break some plates!

51:30.400 --> 51:32.516
Would you like some cake?

51:32.560 --> 51:34.755
So, wanna dance?

51:35.840 --> 51:38.752
No. Ask Nedda, that's her thing.

51:42.360 --> 51:46.239
If something happens between us,
I hope you can handle it.

51:48.160 --> 51:50.196
- Nedda?
- What?

51:51.240 --> 51:55.119
- Would you like to go Greek with me?
- Yeah! Hang on, my bra snapped.

51:56.040 --> 51:58.031
For old times' sake.

52:04.040 --> 52:07.157
Me and three of the guys
tightened that up.

52:09.960 --> 52:12.997
Johnny's teaching me
how to be a cook. This is Maria.

52:13.040 --> 52:15.508
- Great party.
- Confession time.

52:16.960 --> 52:20.509
On my first day,
I stole some of your tips.

52:22.080 --> 52:24.753
I know.
But you put it back the next day.

52:25.400 --> 52:27.789
I was broke. I was really broke.

52:29.880 --> 52:34.317
I'm really glad things
are working out for you, you know.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.794
- I wish you all the best.
- Thanks.

52:36.840 --> 52:38.512
See you Johnny.

52:38.560 --> 52:41.950
- Hey, baby. Let's cut a rug.
- Are you bra-less?

52:49.440 --> 52:51.431
Let's go, Nick!

53:04.160 --> 53:06.151
When do we break the plates?

53:20.320 --> 53:22.311
That's good. Go.

53:22.360 --> 53:24.555
Nedda, come on!

53:28.600 --> 53:32.275
- It's not Greek but it's good.
- Party!

53:48.720 --> 53:51.154
Let's go, Johnny!

53:51.200 --> 53:53.191
That's right. All right.

54:12.800 --> 54:14.597
Bravo!

54:19.960 --> 54:23.157
- Come on, there must be a reason.
- Dumbo.

54:23.200 --> 54:26.192
- Dumbo? The movie?
- Yeah.

54:26.240 --> 54:30.756
No deep hidden meaning.
Plain Dumbo the elephant.

54:30.800 --> 54:34.156
Just before my father left,
he took me to see Dumbo

54:34.200 --> 54:36.270
and I liked it so I save elephants.

54:36.320 --> 54:38.436
I like that movie Dumbo.

54:43.080 --> 54:45.958
The flower market. My secret place.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.992
Only me and 3,000 florists
know about it.

54:52.680 --> 54:55.319
How about a lovely corsage
for the lady?

54:55.360 --> 54:56.952
Good.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.958
- Which one?
- On the bottom, third one in.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.592
This one?

55:02.640 --> 55:04.631
OK, I got it.

55:08.040 --> 55:10.235
You want me to do it?

55:14.040 --> 55:16.235
You never went to the prom, did you?

55:17.280 --> 55:19.999
No. Did you?

55:22.040 --> 55:24.554
I wish you'd stop looking at me
like that.

55:24.600 --> 55:26.875
Like what?

55:26.920 --> 55:28.911
Like that. It's too intense.

55:28.960 --> 55:31.713
You don't look, you stare.
It makes me nervous.

55:43.840 --> 55:46.593
Thank God! You finally got here.

55:46.640 --> 55:49.154
Sorry I'm late. Get off my back.

55:51.640 --> 55:54.438
I think we should go to your place.

55:57.320 --> 55:59.311
I think so.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.958
I really like you
but does it have to be tonight?

56:11.000 --> 56:12.991
Who says?

57:24.040 --> 57:26.031
- I'm OK.
- Are you OK?

57:43.720 --> 57:46.075
You got something?

57:46.120 --> 57:48.429
- You mean rubbers?
- Yeah.

57:50.200 --> 57:53.988
- Talk about a mood changer.
- Well, do you?

57:56.720 --> 58:01.191
The truth is I didn't think this
was going to happen on a first date.

58:01.240 --> 58:03.629
I just didn't think this...

58:04.880 --> 58:07.155
The truth is, it's not going to.

58:07.200 --> 58:09.191
- No.
- It's OK.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.436
I don't know, I just...

58:12.480 --> 58:15.995
If I'd brought something,
what would that look like?

58:16.040 --> 58:19.953
It would look like I was planning
to do it with you.

58:20.000 --> 58:23.709
No, it's OK. Maybe this
is just not such a good idea anyway.

58:23.760 --> 58:27.594
Come on. I'm being penalised
for respecting you.

58:27.640 --> 58:31.633
You're not being penalised,
you're just not getting laid.

58:31.680 --> 58:34.877
Wait a minute now.
Is this about getting laid?

58:36.440 --> 58:41.594
- Let's talk about...
- No. How about I make us a sandwich?

58:42.640 --> 58:44.995
- You want a sandwich?
- A sandwich?

58:47.280 --> 58:51.717
I hate wearing goddamn rubbers,
pardon my French. I know you have to.

58:51.760 --> 58:54.638
I never thought I'd contemplate
sleeping with a man

58:54.680 --> 58:57.638
who said "Pardon my French"
all the time.

58:57.680 --> 59:00.274
Done.
I'll never say those words again.

59:00.320 --> 59:03.517
Where do you pick up
an expression like that?

59:04.800 --> 59:07.917
- This is good. You made this?
- No, my mum.

59:08.960 --> 59:11.190
- Shit.
- Let me see that.

59:11.240 --> 59:13.549
- It's all right.
- I'll get you something.

59:13.600 --> 59:17.878
Just keep pressure on it. Don't
let any blood spill on the meatloaf.

59:17.920 --> 59:20.275
I don't think this is gonna work out.

59:20.320 --> 59:22.356
I can't hear what you're saying.

59:22.400 --> 59:26.154
I'm a BLT-down sort of person,

59:26.200 --> 59:29.829
I think you're looking for
someone a little more

59:29.880 --> 59:32.075
pheasant-under-glass.

59:34.760 --> 59:38.799
- What are you doing in there?
- I'm just looking for Band-Aids.

59:39.920 --> 59:42.639
- What are you doing?
- Come on in. Sit down.

59:42.680 --> 59:44.671
I know first aid.

59:46.480 --> 59:48.948
Give me your finger.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.991
Give me your thumb.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.435
I'm 42.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.677
- I'm 32.
- Really? You don't look it.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.838
- I'm 44.
- Honest?

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.314
I'm gonna be 46 this year.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.031
What do you want for your birthday?

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.595
I want to stop bullshitting
about things like my age.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.792
I'll be 35 on the 11th of November.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.876
You're a Scorpio?

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.670
Look in the medicine cabinet.
I have some.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.837
I didn't want you
to get the wrong impression.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.353
- They're behind the blue...
- I got 'em.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.870
Is it on?

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:57.955
Not yet. You can't just
put it on until it's...

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.791
No, I know.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.314
You know, I wouldn't have gotten
the wrong impression.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.038
Let me hear you. I wanna hear you.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.876
Come on, baby, let it go. Let it go.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.309
Come on. Let it go. Come on.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.438
I need eggs over-easy
and a roast chicken.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.790
- Here you go.
- You wear bandanna, I wear bandanna.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.991
So, the baby's coming soon?
Know what is it yet?

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.953
- Twin boys.
- Twins you got?!

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.434
- Can I touch?
- Yeah, be my guest.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.634
This one just kicked the other one!

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.716
Cora, I never see you like this.

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:22.991
People think I'm a tough bitch
but it ain't true.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.508
Shit like this chokes me up.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.234
Frankie, come here, touch the baby.

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.158
No, that's OK.
My hands are dirty. Next time.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.476
This is your last chance.
I am never getting pregnant again.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:39.195
You said last time!
Flora, the blue, remember?

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.994
Blue is for the morning.
The red one is for the evening.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:46.749
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Two eggs over-easy.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.711
Hello to you, too.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:53.034
I see you made it home all right.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:58.517
Yes, I made it here this morning,
had time enough to put this together.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:01.199
- Nice.
- I slept like a babe.

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.840
So, I saw you over there,
you like kids?

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:09.832
- They're OK.
- You look someone who likes kids.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.836
Yeah? So did my father.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:15.111
What does somebody
who likes kids look like?

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:20.793
I need an order
of liver and onions... Captain Ahab.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.398
Thanks for loaning me the car, Nick.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.031
He's lending me his car,
I got an errand to run.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:37.470
- He's lending you his car?
- He likes my cooking.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.755
How about we talk a walk?
I think we should.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:46.270
- No. I gotta eat.
- We all gotta eat.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:49.437
We'll eat. How about
I make a little picnic for us?

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.471
What's the menu?

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.269
Whatever you like.
You like tuna fish?

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.191
Tino tells me you like tuna.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.391
- I'll make a tuna casserole.
- No! Not casserole.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:08.149
- Tuna fish sandwich.
- I am defined by my tuna sandwich.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.430
I take the tuna out of the can

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:14.712
and I work it between my fingers
till it's real soft.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.955
I'm back.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:31.315
It is kinda scary, you got to admit.
Two people coming together is scary.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.749
You can't deny that it's happening.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:38.396
I'll tell you how I really feel.
I feel like you're too needy for me.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:41.318
I just feel like you want
everything that I am.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.157
I do.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:47.193
Nick tells me guys ask you
out and you keep saying no. Why?

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.070
I'm retired from dating.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:54.398
What does that mean? Something
happened when you were a kid?

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:57.830
Why is it that any time
a women doesn't want to get involved,

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:02.032
men think it's because
they were messed with as a kid?

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.116
They were messed with as a woman.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.310
I'm not gonna mess with you.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.999
Do you like my tuna?

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:12.270
Yeah, it's good.

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:16.835
You didn't graduate high school,
so what? You can go back.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.158
Go back? I don't think so. I had one
highlight in high school, one.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.236
What was that?

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:27.273
I played Sister Sarah
in our production of Guys And Dolls.

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:29.435
No kidding.

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:32.756
- Frankie and Johnny.
- I've heard the song.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.236
- We were a couple before we met.
- Didn't they kill each other?

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:39.750
No. She killed him.
You got the edge there.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.153
Come on.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.790
What are you doing tonight?

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:06.912
- It's my bowling night.
- Great! I love bowling.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:10.316
No. It's a league and besides,
you have your errand.

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:14.353
- After my errand.
- No. I need a night to get over you.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.639
OK, I'm on Meadow Brook. 14...

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.599
Meadow Brook.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.710
111? What is 111?

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:52.478
So, am I close? There it is.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.592
Let's bowl.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.431
Now, concentrate, Cora.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.029
Here we go, Frankie.
Need this spare, honey. Go!

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:55.675
Watch this. Watch! Beautiful!

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.631
- Hell.
- Great, Nedda.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:11.240
- It was two.
- It was better than last time.

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.312
- You see that?
- Where'd you learn to bowl so good?

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.828
Altoona, PA.
That's about all I learned.

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.556
You're from Altoona?

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:36.596
I think I'm going to have
some kind of fit.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:41.312
I was born in Altoona.

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:44.432
- Very funny.
- No! Are you kidding?

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:48.632
I was born in St Stephen's Hospital.
We lived on Martell Street.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.353
I suppose you went
to Moody High School?

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.868
No, because we left when I was eight.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:57.196
I went to
Park Lane Elementary, though.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.231
Are you really from Altoona?

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.748
Why would anyone pretend
to be from Altoona?

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:05.634
To keep up this silly coincidence
theory. Don't encourage him.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.956
My mother ran off with a guy
she met at an AA meeting,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.356
my father took us to Baltimore,
to his sister.

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:15.437
- Cora, it's your turn.
- No, this is better. Go on.

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.836
She couldn't cope with us
so they put us in foster homes.

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:23.357
Now, I'm 18 years old
and I'm with the carnival.

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.473
This guy, Mr Memory, he's 85
years old, he's got a memory...

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.832
Instant recall, he's got things
in his head - entire books,

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.792
- palindromes, speeches...
- What's that?

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:38.992
Something you can spell backwards
and forwards the same way.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.837
- Madam.
- Otto.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:43.075
Boob, b-o-o-b.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.918
- Puppy!
- Close enough.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.633
Anyway, the old guy says to me...

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:50.989
Are we bowling or what?

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:55.716
Sorry. Shall we bowl?

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:58.228
That's why he has such a good memory.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:01.477
He can't bowl in those shoes.
What is wrong with him?

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.034
I'm gonna use my own little ball.

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:28.478
Come on, Frankie, pull another one!

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.636
- How you doin'?
- OK.

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.114
You all right?

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.199
I know I wasn't supposed to come.
I don't know how you feel about it.

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.800
- It's OK.
- It's OK?

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.831
Really?

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.754
Frankie, you're up.

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.633
We need a strike.
They're ahead by four.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:13.275
What are you talking about?
Let me look at this.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:17.711
- There, see?
- 92 and eight is 100, not 96.

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:20.035
No, that was a happy face I drew.

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.594
If you're gonna doctor a score,
doctor mine.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.554
I'm going all over the place
with you.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.955
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.309
I'm in love with you. I love you.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:37.717
I am totally, completely mad for you.
My heart stops every time I see you.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:40.035
I think we should be married.

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:43.038
I definitely want kids.
Four or five if possible.

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.640
There, I said it.
It wasn't so difficult.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:49.593
You don't have to say anything,
I just wanted to get it out.

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:54.953
- Talk about a load off.
- Talk about a load off?

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.560
Talk about a crock of shit.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:01.639
Don't say that, that's vulgar talk.
You don't talk like that.

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.830
Fuck you how I talk.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.314
I'll talk any fucking way
I feel like.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:11.069
This is my fucking bowling night.
Who the fuck are to spoil it

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:13.111
by telling me you love me?

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:16.077
She really likes this guy.

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.917
That makes me unloveable?

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:21.509
No, it makes you a creep.
No, you're sincere, that's worse.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:25.155
I mean, are you nuts?
Kids, for Christ's sake!

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.236
So, what's wrong with kids?

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.669
- I hate kids.
- I don't believe that.

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:32.712
- OK, I'm too old to have kids.
- No, you're not.

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:36.275
I can't have any. Are you happy now?

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:44.314
We'll adopt.

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.955
You don't just decide
to go falling in love with people.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.275
- Why not?
- They don't like it.

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.912
Do you need help?

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:56.670
How would you like it if Nedda said
she loved you and wanted your baby?

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:01.633
Nedda, I really like you,
you're nice but I love Frankie.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.319
- I'm getting help.
- You don't know me.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.514
I can't do anything,
I slept with the guy.

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:12.677
- You slept with him?!
- Frankie didn't tell you?

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.950
She said you slept
with everybody else.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.197
- She didn't mention the gold pumps?
- He wore gold pumps?

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.231
You just wanna believe that.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.635
It makes it easier for you
to run away.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.750
"You don't know me."

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.473
I don't know you? I know you.

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:32.318
What do you want, Frankie?
What do you want?

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.476
What do you want from a guy?

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:37.398
I want a guy who will love me
no matter what.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.317
You got him. Here. Me.

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.920
This is worse than
Looking For Mr Goodbar.

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:46.953
I am trying to improve my life
and I'm running out of time.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.151
Find someone else
who is double-parked like you.

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.237
It could happen.
I could meet somebody tomorrow.

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.636
- Get laid, think I was in love.
- Don't let me stop you.

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:01.195
You're not stopping me,
I'm stopping me. I love you.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:05.153
But I'm so scared.
So scared you are gonna retreat back.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.272
You know, that place
you're so comfortable with,

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.392
that place where nobody can find you.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:13.635
That's why I'm coming on so strong.

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.591
What's going on here?

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:24.038
Frankie, chances like this
don't come along often.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:28.119
You gotta take 'em because
if you don't, they're gone forever.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:32.152
And you may wind up not only -

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:35.033
and pardon my French
for the very last time -

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.548
screwing some other person you meet,

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.673
thinking you're in love with
this person and marrying them.

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.188
- It happens.
- OK, you're making her cry.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:46.913
Boy, are you barking up
the wrong tree!

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.520
I never thought
I could fall for a woman

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.949
who said "barking up the wrong tree".

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.878
- Let's go.
- You've driven me to it!

01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:00.516
All right, let's calm down, shall we?
Wait outside. Are you all right?

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:04.394
I've never used
that expression. Ever!

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.237
If I wanted a man in my life,

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:09.192
I wouldn't have bought a VCR
I can't even work.

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.790
Excuse me...

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:52.308
I live in the building
across from you and...

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.989
I've seen how he beats you.

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.189
Is there anything I can do?

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.277
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.111
Shit!

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.753
Excuse me.
Don't be afraid, let me help.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.791
Thanks, mister.

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:28.751
I can't take it any more. You're not
giving up your job because of him.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.519
You were there first.
I'll handle him.

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.509
Now, what's the problem?

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:39.269
He says he's in love with me.
He wants to marry me.

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:42.153
- Bastard!
- He's talking about a family.

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:46.079
You can pick 'em. Love, a home,
marriage? Screw that shit.

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.714
- Can I answer this?
- Tell him to go to hell.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.310
Frankie just said something
very derogatory about you

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.635
but I know at least a dozen women

01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:00.309
and quite a few men
I can put you in touch with.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.352
Johnny, give it a rest.
She doesn't want to talk.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.470
He wants to know about tonight.

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:09.876
Saturday night,
the loneliest night of the week.

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:14.158
I'm busy, call me in a few years.

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.590
He's singing.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:25.078
I got to go, we're expecting
another call from you any minute.

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:33.110
Remember, you're new here
so you're easy to fire.

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:37.472
OK, keep things clean. Over here,
we have the ice for the drinks.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.830
Remember that. Here's the telephone,
don't use it.

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:46.034
I like your ponytail. You don't
write scripts? All dishes go here.

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:49.277
Over here, all waitresses
put dirty dishes here.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.912
You keep clean.

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.951
- You're going to kill me.
- Why?

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.471
Many people changing shifts. It makes
me dizzy. It's not my fault, OK?

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:05.236
- You had tonight off.
- So did you.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.430
Yeah, well, something came up.

01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:09.755
Something came up for me too.

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:15.078
Look, I don't wanna hurt
your feelings, OK?

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.671
I really don't but Nick doesn't like
the help messing around.

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:24.271
So please, don't make this difficult,
I really need this job.

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.198
You think I would
jeopardise your job?

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:30.630
I'd quit before I'd do that,
I mean that. And I need this job.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:34.036
OK, let's just both
go about our business.

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:40.393
A chicken sand' and
it's birthday time at table eight.

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:43.477
This is new cashier
and she's my grandmother.

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:47.149
You give her check when you finished.
Come.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.395
Good, have good time.

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:58.197
- Happy birthday, Uncle Lou.
- You look great!

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.231
Lou, blow it out.

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:07.716
- Thank you.
- Grilled cheese and skins.

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:11.070
I got a little carried away
at the bowling alley.

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:16.274
My errand didn't turn out too good,
so I'm sorry, I apologise.

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.754
You certainly made an impression.

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:24.551
You want something to drink?

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:32.873
I'm on a break too, so...
talk, don't talk, it's up to you.

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:56.634
Are you keeping
some big secret from me?

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:59.990
- Like what?
- Like I don't know, you tell me.

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.875
- I'm not married.
- Were you?

01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:06.911
Yes.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:11.550
- How many times?
- Once. That it?

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.591
Were you in jail?

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:20.354
- I served 18 months in the slammer.
- What for?

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:23.995
Signing somebody else's name
to somebody else's cheque.

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:28.795
- A forger?
- I'd call it a failed forger.

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.831
I just did it once, I was...

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.794
Is that where you
did all your reading?

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:37.637
Yeah, most of it.

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:40.274
I got most of my books
from Henry Hank Hill.

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:44.272
- Don't know him.
- Nobody did.

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:49.348
He was executed two months ago.
I cooked him his last meal.

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:56.714
- This lettuce is limp.
- I'm sorry, you're right.

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:58.910
I'm going to the john.

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.554
How about you?
Were you ever married?

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:05.830
No. Chef's salad, chicken salad
and a side of 'slaw.

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:08.189
- Anyone serious?
- Try terminal.

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:11.152
Who's this serious person?

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:16.235
He got more serious with
who I thought was my best friend.

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:21.070
- Really? How long ago was that?
- Three years.

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:28.238
I was divorced three years ago.
Now, is that a coincidence?

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:31.397
- Really?
- I cross my heart and hope to die.

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.352
- Waitress!
- I'll be right with you, ma'am.

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:40.630
- You got any kids?
- Two.

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.750
I thought so. You see 'em?

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:46.837
- Yesterday. First time in two years.
- Yeah?

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:48.916
That's what the errand was.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.758
My wife remarried,
she lives in the suburbs.

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:55.270
- I hate the suburbs.
- It's not bad. Beautiful house.

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:59.438
Nice. I could never have provided
them with anything like that.

01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.916
I got there, there were my kids,
playing on the lawn.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.155
I bet they were glad to see you.

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:13.149
I didn't get out of the car,
you know. I just couldn't...

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.470
They looked so happy and all.
They got so big.

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.268
Looked like somebody else's kids.

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.231
I just drove away.

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:38.836
It's like I lost them, you know?
That's how I feel.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:42.634
- Waitress!
- Hello? Can we get some service?

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:46.070
You haven't lost them,
you're just not ready.

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:52.871
Finally! What's safe to eat here?

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:55.388
I'm sorry, we're closed.

01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.631
What kind of a place is this?

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.670
Hurry up, let's go.

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:09.474
- Night, Frankie.
- Night, Andreas.

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:12.114
Here's yours, Frankie.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:15.550
- You come back any Saturday night.
- Thanks, Maxine.

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.591
- Night, Maxine.
- Night.

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:21.712
Was she home? Did you talk to her?

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.196
- What she say?
- I'm seeing the kids next weekend.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:29.151
- Good.
- Thank you.

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.431
What is that?

01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:37.471
It's a rose.

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:40.471
Grew in the kitchen.

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.311
Good night, closing up.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:50.353
Everything finished. It's good.

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.197
What's that?

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:56.038
- It's potato.
- It's a rose.

01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.514
- Johnny made it.
- On my break.

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.391
It's nice.

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:03.829
Red potato, it's very romantic.

01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:07.431
Frankie, you want lift home?

01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:09.516
It's OK. Thanks.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.276
OK, you know how to close up.
Bring back fork.

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:23.155
- Good night.
- Night, Nick.

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:27.351
Come on, Grandma,
we go home and watch wrestling.

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.758
Come on, I'll walk you home.

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:37.438
So, how about you? Do you ever
want to kill yourself sometimes?

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.797
Yeah, everybody wants
to kill themself sometime.

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:44.115
Can we change the subject?

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.549
- You want me to buy you that?
- Yeah.

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:55.717
If you had any wish,
what you wish to be?

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:58.069
You won't laugh?

01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:02.033
- Teacher. Teaching little kids.
- That's good.

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:05.436
What about you?
Did you always dream of being a cook?

01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:08.278
No, prison did it.

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:12.711
When I went in and I heard
that "clank", you know, I died.

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:17.714
Then they put me in the kitchen
with food and, I don't know,

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:19.796
suddenly I was born again.

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:24.038
I started to feel
like I could breathe again.

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:27.356
You know,
it was like I had aspirations.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:30.597
Aspiration?
Have you been shaving again?

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:35.950
So what about this
terminal relationship you had?

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.959
What was it? A guy who left you
for your best friend?

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.834
Phillip? You know what
the main thing I felt was? Dumb.

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:47.759
I even introduced them.
I lent them money.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:49.791
I gave her my old television.

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:53.559
They're probably watching it
right now.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:56.558
I hope it explodes and blows
their faces off.

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:02.155
What about before Phillip?
Anybody else?

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.919
I don't wanna talk about that.

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:18.920
OK, but you can't spend the night.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.679
There's gotta be
something in this world

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:30.077
better than watching you do that
but I'm damned if I know what it is.

01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.712
Yeah, sure.

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:35.912
No, I'd put it up there.
It's a vision, inspired spectacle.

01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:39.316
I'd put it up there with
the Grand Canyon,

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:42.909
mother nursing her child,
triumphant facts of nature.

01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:46.669
- You been to the Grand Canyon?
- I have not, no.

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:50.474
Me either. I'd like to go there
some day. Hawaii, too.

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.711
Open your robe.

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:01.795
No, I don't wanna open my robe.

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.837
Why?

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:07.348
I don't know,
I just wanna look at you.

01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.196
15 seconds, that's all.

01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:17.597
- I just wanna look at it.
- Look at what? Why?

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:22.829
I don't know, I just...
To know that I can.

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:25.917
That I can look at the woman I love
and just see her.

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:29.350
Her eyes, her breasts,
her stomach, her...

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.631
- Don't say it! I hate that word.
- I wasn't going to.

01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:35.148
I hate both of them!

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:38.317
I'll look up some new ones
in my thesaurus.

01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:45.556
I never know when you're
playing games or being serious.

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:48.990
It's both. Serious games.
Why do we have to name everything?

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:53.556
Say you had a pet parakeet. If it was
beautiful, I'd want to look at it.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:56.717
You'd let me look at it
and we'd move on.

01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:00.150
I had a parakeet, I hated it.
I was glad when it died.

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:18.958
15 seconds. I'm timing this.
Turn that light out.

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:47.272
I told my cousin I didn't want a
bird. She swore I'd love a parakeet.

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.788
What's to love?
They don't do anything

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:53.469
except not sing when you want them to
and sing when you don't

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:55.909
and make that awful scratching noise.

01:32:55.960 --> 01:33:00.397
If I ever get another pet,
it'll be a dog.

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.470
Something you can hold.

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:08.308
The only time I got my hands on
that parakeet was the day it died

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:12.148
and I had to pick it up
and throw it away. That's enough.

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:15.397
That's got to be 15 seconds.
Happy now?

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:29.510
That music is nice.

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:35.751
It makes me think of grace.

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.430
This is Midnight With Marlon.

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:43.109
For information on becoming
a member of the WNYL family,

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:46.709
why not give me a call? 555-1111.

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:52.475
Why do you want to kill
yourself sometimes?

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:56.718
I want to kill myself when I think
I'm the only person in the world

01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:01.834
and that part of me that feels
that way is trapped inside this body

01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:04.110
that only bumps into other bodies

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:09.109
without connecting to another person
in the world trapped inside of them.

01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:13.550
We have to connect.

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.551
We just have to.

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:22.470
I feel... very...

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:24.431
Say it.

01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:27.835
- I don't know what.
- Say it anyway.

01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:30.952
- Protective.
- Good. That's very nice.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.754
I'm looking for somebody
to take care of me this time.

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.836
Aren't we all?

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:42.599
Why do we keep going from one subject
I don't like to another?

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:46.959
What is this?
Suddenly the armour's up?

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.718
What about your armour?

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:53.390
Besides, I wasn't talking about you.
Not everyone thinks life is a picnic.

01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:58.398
Some of us have problems.
Some of us have sorrows.

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:01.432
People like you
are so busy telling us what you want

01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:03.471
you don't notice the rest of us

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.353
who aren't exactly singing
Yankee Doodle Dandy.

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:09.278
Hold it, how we getting
into this now?

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:11.470
I've done nothing but notice you.

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.397
You don't, you smother me.

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:16.955
I'm not giving up everything
for someone I don't know.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.230
I can't repeat the same stupidity.

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:23.239
Who says you have to give up
anything? We're talking about love.

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:26.192
- We're not in love.
- That's what you think.

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:30.074
I think we are. Just because
you've given up on that possibility

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:32.873
there's no need to drag me down
to that level.

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:36.553
I think you better leave now.

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:40.275
You know, I'm sorry.
I thought you were a kindred spirit.

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:44.630
Kindred means two of a kind
sharing a great affinity.

01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:48.878
- I know what kindred means.
- Shall we go for affinity?

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:55.995
You know, that is the first really
rotten thing you've said to me.

01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:02.479
To make fun of somebody else's
intelligence or education or lack of,

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:05.318
that is somebody
I'd be very glad not to know.

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.396
I thought you were sad, weird.

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:10.113
- I didn't know you were cruel.
- I'm sorry.

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:14.517
It's just a cruelty waiting
to happen again. I want you to go.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:16.915
Why do you want me to go? Really.

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:19.679
I want to be alone,
I want to watch my VCR,

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:21.915
eat ice cream, I want to go to sleep.

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:27.557
Come on, alone? Sooner or later
you're gonna have to deal with us.

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:29.830
There's just no two ways about it.

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:34.235
So why don't we just get it
over with? You're in the mood.

01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:38.034
Tomorrow's Sunday, day off.
We'll sleep in. Let's talk.

01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.071
- Right, I'm calling Tim.
- Tim?

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:42.634
No, Bobby.
He'll beat the shit out of you.

01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:45.877
- Not yet.
- I'll open that window and scream.

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:49.959
In this city? Everybody's doing
the same thing, who'll hear you?

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.515
Get out!

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:04.072
I promise I will go
only I wanna make a call.

01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:14.238
You know, this all should be so easy.
Why is it always so damn hard?

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:23.559
Hello? Midnight With Marlon?
Hello, Marlon. My name is Johnny

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:28.720
and I would like to know the name
of that piece of piano music

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.751
you were playing a minute ago

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:33.314
so I can buy the record
for my lady love,

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:37.478
whose name is Frankie, is that
a coincidence? Frankie and Johnny.

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:43.716
Debussy, Claude Debussy, right.
Clair de Lune, you got that?

01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:46.950
Why are you doing this?

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.673
Everything I want is in this room.

01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:56.631
Hello, Marlon?

01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:02.157
I know you don't take requests
but could you just listen to me?

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:05.237
Now, there's a man and a woman.

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:07.748
He's a cook, she's a waitress.

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:11.833
Now, they meet
and they don't connect,

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:17.432
only she noticed him,
he could feel it, and he noticed her

01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:20.199
and they both knew
it was gonna happen.

01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:25.155
They made love
and for maybe one whole night,

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.430
they forgot the 10 million things

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:31.109
that make people think
"I don't love this person,

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:34.152
"I don't like this person,
I don't know this..."

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:37.749
Instead, it was perfect
and they were perfect

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.473
and that's all there was
to know about it.

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:43.318
Only now, she's beginning
to forget all that

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.430
and maybe he'll forget it, too.

01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:48.517
So could you play an encore
for Frankie and Johnny

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:53.350
in the hope of something that ought
to last and not self-destruct?

01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:00.914
Why don't you just
think about it? Thank you.

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:12.069
I want to show you something.

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.788
That guy I didn't want to talk about,

01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:31.400
he did this with a belt buckle.

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:42.951
It's gone.

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:46.436
It'll never go.

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:49.313
It's gone. I made it go.

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:52.909
No, Johnny, you can't make it
go away. Nobody can.

01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:58.870
He's the reason I can't have...

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:03.271
kids.

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:12.275
He knocked me around

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:19.194
when I was pregnant and...

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:24.829
I lost the baby.

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:28.789
There were complications.

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:37.871
He's gone now.

01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:42.517
I would never hit you. Never.

01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:47.509
You don't have to be afraid any more.

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.676
I am. I'm afraid.

01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:55.274
I'm afraid to be alone,
I'm afraid not to be alone.

01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:59.233
I'm afraid of what I am,
what I'm not,

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:02.477
what I might become,
what I might never become.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.790
I don't wanna stay at my job
for the rest of my life but I...

01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.720
I'm afraid to leave.

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:22.709
And I'm just tired, you know,
I'm just so tired of being afraid.

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:32.030
Honey, listen.

01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:39.674
I know I can't make the bad go away.
You're right, I can't.

01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:45.035
But when the bad comes again...

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:49.155
I'm gonna be next to you.

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:55.951
I can't, Johnny.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.797
I'm sorry.

01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:36.917
This is WNYL in New York

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:40.157
and you're listening to
Midnight With Marlon.

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:43.476
As you know, it's not my policy
to take requests

01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:46.592
but there's always
an exception to the rule.

01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:51.760
I don't know if this is the most
beautiful song, Frankie and Johnny.

01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:54.189
I wish they
really were your names

01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.879
but I know when
my leg's being pulled.

01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:00.559
God, how I wish you two
really existed.

01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:04.195
Maybe I'm crazy, but I'd still
like to believe in love.

01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:06.231
Why the hell do you think
I work these hours?

01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:14.756
Anyway, you two moonbeams,
whoever, wherever you are,

01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:16.916
whatever you're doing,

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:19.269
this one's for you.

01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:21.470
Here's an encore.

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:43.155
You wanna brush?

01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:48.395
That means you want me to brush?

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:54.879
Take the blue one,
it's never been used.

01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:07.835
I'm not gonna ask whose robe this is.

01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:10.671
Good.

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:22.837
You should get toothpaste
with fluoride.

01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:24.871
Listen.

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.591
No matter what?

01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:51.156
I'm 36.

01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:52.951
English

01:52:53.305 --> 01:52:59.422
