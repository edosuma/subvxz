00:33.520 --> 00:36.120
Beautiful night.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.640
Yeah. Just right for
a tale of terror.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.960
Ha!

00:40.960 --> 00:42.240
What are you
doing?

00:42.240 --> 00:44.640
Getting ready for
fright night. What else?

00:46.120 --> 00:48.640
Stop.
What is that?

00:48.640 --> 00:51.080
It's a magic flute
from my dad's shop.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.160
It's supposed
to make it rain.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.600
You're not supposed
to take dad's stuff.

01:00.600 --> 01:01.760
[Blows loudly]

01:06.600 --> 01:08.120
Enough.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.040
Dad's magic never works.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.520
Never say never.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.040
Maybe you're just
doing it wrong.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.360
You think?

01:16.360 --> 01:19.360
You never know the power
of something magical

01:19.360 --> 01:20.920
until it's
been tested.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.760
I hope this
is about your story.

01:22.760 --> 01:25.560
If you believe in magic,

01:25.560 --> 01:28.760
then you know
it can be very powerful,

01:28.760 --> 01:32.760
but only if you understand
how to use it.

01:32.760 --> 01:36.560
Magical powers
can be used for good,

01:36.560 --> 01:39.560
but if you don't know
what you're doing,

01:39.560 --> 01:41.040
back off

01:41.040 --> 01:44.440
because that same power
can turn against you.

01:45.800 --> 01:51.000
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.080
I call this story...

02:06.960 --> 02:10.440
[Girl]
To trap a creature of night,

02:10.440 --> 02:14.520
trace a door on a wall
with chalk so white.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.480
<i> Arabarius, lokoradee,</i>

02:43.480 --> 02:46.160
creature of darkness,
come to me!

02:59.680 --> 03:01.280
Stay where you are!

03:02.520 --> 03:05.160
I command you,
stay where you are!

03:10.160 --> 03:11.880
<i> Arabarius, lokoradet,</i>

03:11.880 --> 03:14.800
I command you,
enter this amulet.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.960
I command you,
enter this amulet!

03:21.360 --> 03:23.760
I command you,
enter the amulet!

03:25.280 --> 03:26.280
Aah!

03:31.440 --> 03:32.760
[Screaming]

03:45.920 --> 03:48.640
Well, this is it, gang--
home, sweet home.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.840
It's big!

03:51.840 --> 03:54.920
Hey, last one up
gets the lumpy bed.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.640
Well, go after him.
You might win.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.840
I like the lumpy bed.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.800
Hey, we got
our own bathroom.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.280
[Wind blowing]

04:09.280 --> 04:11.800
Man, it's cold in here.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.800
This place is great.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.360
Let's get our stuff.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.360
[Groans]

04:23.880 --> 04:26.800
OK, that's it for
now, guys. Bedtime.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.000
Oh!
Oh!

04:29.520 --> 04:32.320
Um, I think we got
to skip school tomorrow.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.400
Yeah. There's plenty to
unpack. School can wait.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.080
No, it can't.
You feel all right?

04:38.080 --> 04:39.920
Yeah. Just tired.

04:39.920 --> 04:43.320
Well, you both look exhausted.
Come on, hit the sheets.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.320
And no staying up late
telling ghost stories, either.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.640
I mean it, Aaron.
Every time you do,

04:48.640 --> 04:50.760
you scare your brother
half to death.

04:50.760 --> 04:51.880
OK? Up you go.

04:51.880 --> 04:52.880
Good night.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.280
Good night.

04:54.280 --> 04:55.840
Good night.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.720
Hey, cut it out!

05:11.720 --> 05:13.720
It's not me!

05:13.720 --> 05:15.200
Doug!

05:15.200 --> 05:17.280
It's not me!
I swear!

05:22.280 --> 05:23.720
What was that?

05:23.720 --> 05:25.800
It felt like
an earthquake.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.680
Mom said
no scary stuff.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.400
I didn't do it!

05:38.400 --> 05:39.760
Yeah, sure!

05:41.240 --> 05:42.640
Oh, I get it.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.680
Paybacks for telling
you those stories

05:44.680 --> 05:46.440
at the hotel
last night.

05:46.440 --> 05:51.800
Well, sorry, pal, but
I don't scare like you.

05:56.760 --> 05:59.200
You are so
full of it!

05:59.200 --> 06:00.200
Oh, yeah?

06:00.200 --> 06:01.120
Yeah.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.120
Yeah?

06:02.120 --> 06:03.120
Yeah.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.640
Yeah? Come here.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.120
Uh, wait,
wait, wait.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.680
Shouldn't we
clean this up?

06:09.720 --> 06:10.880
Nah! Nah!

06:23.040 --> 06:25.120
[Aaron]
Sorry.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.200
No problem.

06:34.280 --> 06:35.600
Hi. Aaron?

06:35.600 --> 06:37.600
Hi. I'm Miss Berg.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.040
I'll introduce you to
the rest of the class.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.000
Class, we have a new
student joining us--

06:42.000 --> 06:44.120
Aaron Johnston.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.120
Please make him
feel welcome.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.960
Aaron, you can take the
seat next to Connie.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.000
Ah, sorry.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.280
Ow! Ow!

07:03.600 --> 07:04.760
Mr. Johnston?

07:06.080 --> 07:07.600
Please take your seat.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.200
Open your geometry books
to page 60.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.080
[Bang]

07:37.600 --> 07:40.440
Are you a comedian,
Mr. Johnston?

07:40.440 --> 07:42.760
No, ma'am.
I was just--

07:42.760 --> 07:46.520
Good. We don't tolerate
comedians in this classroom.

07:46.520 --> 07:48.960
Now, pick up
your things.

07:51.400 --> 07:56.200
We'll be having a quiz tomorrow,
so I suggest you take notes.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.280
This is not a good start,
Mr. Johnston.

08:23.560 --> 08:26.920
Well, maybe I'm
jinxed or something.

08:26.920 --> 08:27.920
[Doug]
Yeah.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.440
Hey, so you
OK?

08:29.440 --> 08:30.960
You don't look
that hot.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.440
Yeah. I'm fine.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.520
Hi, Aaron.

08:34.559 --> 08:35.320
Ow!

08:38.600 --> 08:40.360
Cool necklace.

08:41.600 --> 08:42.760
Huh?

08:42.760 --> 08:46.000
Your necklace,
I like it.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Oh, yeah, um, it was
my grandfather's.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.280
He was a pilot.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.040
It's his wings.
They're silver.

08:55.480 --> 08:56.840
I noticed that.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.240
Well, I'll
see you tomorrow.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.400
Yeah.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.880
Aaron's got
a girlfriend.

09:03.880 --> 09:04.880
Do not.

09:04.880 --> 09:05.880
Do, too.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.400
I don't.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.960
Give me...

09:40.440 --> 09:41.440
Wow.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.680
Cool dream.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.040
[Girl]
To trap a creature of night,

09:51.040 --> 09:54.440
trace a door on the wall
with chalk so white.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.160
Connie?

10:09.960 --> 10:12.320
What are you doing?

10:17.400 --> 10:19.360
Whoa!

10:19.360 --> 10:21.400
Cool.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.840
<i> Arabarius, lokoradee,</i>

10:25.840 --> 10:28.560
creature of darkness,
come to me.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.240
Who are you
talking to?

10:34.960 --> 10:36.240
Whoa!

10:36.240 --> 10:37.480
Stay where you are!

10:40.200 --> 10:42.360
I command you,
stay where you are!

10:42.360 --> 10:45.080
Connie, look out!

10:45.080 --> 10:46.680
<i> Arabarius, lokoradet,</i>

10:46.680 --> 10:49.400
I command you,
enter this amulet!

10:56.080 --> 10:59.040
I was wrong!
I did it wrong!

11:01.680 --> 11:02.920
No!

11:02.920 --> 11:04.920
What's going on?

11:07.880 --> 11:12.080
Oh, man. I just had
this nightmare.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.800
There was this...

11:13.800 --> 11:15.760
This nasty-looking
guy,

11:15.760 --> 11:17.560
and Connie
was there.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.080
That girl from school?

11:19.080 --> 11:20.280
Yeah.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.760
Figures.

11:21.760 --> 11:22.760
[Coughing]

11:22.760 --> 11:24.400
You feeling
all right?

11:24.400 --> 11:27.760
Not really.
I think I'm sick.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.280
[Scraping noise]

11:37.080 --> 11:40.600
Aaron, what's going on?

11:43.840 --> 11:44.840
Aaron.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.440
Aaron, don't!

12:01.800 --> 12:03.240
What is it?

12:06.240 --> 12:08.920
I don't know.

12:13.760 --> 12:17.680
[Aaron] It's Connie,
but it says Laura.

12:17.680 --> 12:20.200
[Doug]
Then who's that?

12:22.240 --> 12:23.840
I don't get it.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.080
[Boys screaming]

12:35.240 --> 12:37.240
[Screaming]

12:38.600 --> 12:40.040
Guys, what's going on?

12:40.040 --> 12:41.520
Did you see it?

12:41.520 --> 12:43.440
What? Why are you
screaming?

12:43.440 --> 12:45.520
[Aaron]
There was a ghost!

12:45.520 --> 12:47.160
Oh, more ghost stories!

12:47.160 --> 12:48.680
But this one's
for real!

12:48.680 --> 12:50.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.200
I think you've got
a fever.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.440
Have you guys
been up all night?

12:54.440 --> 12:56.200
There was
a ghost.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.200
It came through
the wall!

12:58.200 --> 13:00.680
Guys, enough. Look, I want
you both in bed right now.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.200
Come on.
Let's go.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.760
Now!

13:05.280 --> 13:06.720
You sure
you're OK?

13:06.720 --> 13:09.040
No, I'm not OK!
A ghost just tried to--

13:09.040 --> 13:11.120
Go to sleep!

13:11.120 --> 13:13.120
You'll feel better
in the morning.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.640
Good night, guys.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.680
[Mr. Johnston] And
no more ghost stories.

13:45.160 --> 13:47.760
[Connie]
I have no idea why I do this

13:47.760 --> 13:49.600
all the time,
and it's just--

13:49.600 --> 13:50.600
Hi, Connie.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.120
Hi, Aaron.

13:52.120 --> 13:54.600
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

13:54.600 --> 13:56.120
Alone?

13:56.120 --> 13:58.120
Sure.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.200
See you.

14:00.680 --> 14:01.880
What's up?

14:01.880 --> 14:04.560
Are you related to a girl
named Laura Turner?

14:04.560 --> 14:05.800
Why?

14:05.800 --> 14:07.160
Because I have
to talk to her.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.640
That's not funny.

14:10.160 --> 14:13.760
I'm not trying to
be funny. Who is she?

14:13.760 --> 14:17.400
Laura's my twin sister.
Who got you to do this?

14:17.400 --> 14:20.240
Nobody.
Is there a problem?

14:21.840 --> 14:22.840
Laura's dead.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.960
Uh, I'm sorry.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.520
Forget it.

14:30.520 --> 14:31.760
Wait.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.040
Have you ever
seen this before?

14:36.040 --> 14:37.520
This is
Laura's yearbook.

14:37.520 --> 14:40.160
Where did you
get this?

14:41.480 --> 14:44.080
[Coughing]

14:45.600 --> 14:49.520
"Poltergeist--
a friendly spirit."

14:49.520 --> 14:52.520
Yeah, right.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.040
"Quicksilver--

14:54.040 --> 14:56.040
"a teenage girl poltergeist

14:56.040 --> 14:59.600
known for leaving the letter Q
wherever they haunt."

15:01.560 --> 15:05.480
Q? There was a...

15:05.480 --> 15:06.480
A...

15:07.560 --> 15:09.080
Ohhh...

15:14.080 --> 15:16.440
This is Laura's yearbook.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.920
She had a secret
hiding place--

15:20.920 --> 15:23.000
Behind the wall
near the floor?

15:23.000 --> 15:27.160
Connie, I live
in your old house.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.440
I know this is hard
to talk about,

15:33.440 --> 15:36.000
but, um,
how did she die?

15:40.520 --> 15:44.440
We only lived
in that house a few weeks

15:44.440 --> 15:46.440
when Laura
started telling everyone

15:46.440 --> 15:49.240
she thought it was haunted.

15:49.240 --> 15:54.040
She found out it was built over
an old cemetery or something...

15:55.520 --> 15:59.760
And said there was an evil
creature lurking in the walls,

15:59.760 --> 16:02.280
but she was sick!

16:02.280 --> 16:03.800
She had this fever.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.920
The doctors didn't know
what was wrong.

16:05.920 --> 16:08.400
Laura said
it was the ghost.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.240
Well, what happened?

16:10.240 --> 16:12.920
No one believed her.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.440
How could they?

16:14.440 --> 16:16.840
They thought
it was the fever.

16:18.240 --> 16:22.440
So she said she had to get
rid of the ghost herself.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.440
How?

16:26.920 --> 16:31.400
She got a book on magic...

16:31.400 --> 16:37.360
And one night,
she lit some candles...

16:37.360 --> 16:39.880
And no one knows
what happened.

16:39.880 --> 16:42.600
The room caught on fire,
and she...

16:44.440 --> 16:45.880
I...

16:45.880 --> 16:48.920
I think I know
what happened.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.920
[Coughing]

16:59.920 --> 17:01.000
Shoot.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.720
I'm not going
to get more.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.839
Aah!

17:16.839 --> 17:18.839
Weird things
have been happening

17:18.839 --> 17:20.920
ever since
I moved in that house.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.960
Then I had this dream.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.480
There was a girl. I
thought it was you, but...

17:25.480 --> 17:27.400
It was Laura.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.600
I don't want
to hear this.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.720
She was doing some kind of
magic to get rid of the ghost,

17:31.720 --> 17:33.520
but it didn't work.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.560
Then she looked at me.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.160
She looked right at me,
Connie, and she said,

17:38.160 --> 17:39.840
"I did it wrong."

17:39.840 --> 17:42.280
She was telling me how
to get rid of the ghost!

17:42.280 --> 17:44.040
I don't believe it!
I can't!

17:44.040 --> 17:45.800
Look.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.280
I'm sorry
if this is mean,

17:48.280 --> 17:51.760
but you didn't believe her
the first time

17:51.760 --> 17:54.240
and look what happened.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.760
It's happening again.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.360
My brother is sick,

17:58.360 --> 18:04.320
and I'm not going to let any ghost or
-- or whatever hurt him.

18:05.840 --> 18:08.240
I've seen it.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.840
I believe.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.840
I-I need your help.

18:16.840 --> 18:19.880
Laura's giving you
a second chance.

18:28.320 --> 18:29.760
Hello?

18:31.840 --> 18:34.280
Quicksilver...

18:34.280 --> 18:36.760
If that's what you are,

18:36.760 --> 18:39.520
it does mean
you're friendly, right?

18:43.760 --> 18:46.680
Man, I don't believe this.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.760
Aah! Aaron,
you won't believe it!

19:08.760 --> 19:11.240
There's two ghosts--
a good one and a bad one.

19:11.240 --> 19:14.040
The Quicksilver was here, but
the bad ghost came and took over.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.760
[Aaron] I know.
It's OK. Relax.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.240
What's she doing here?

19:18.240 --> 19:21.240
She's going to help us
get rid of the bad ghost.

19:23.560 --> 19:24.800
Where's Mom?

19:24.800 --> 19:26.400
Uh, she went to
pick up Dad at work.

19:26.400 --> 19:30.200
Good. We have to do this
before they get back.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.440
It feels so weird being
here after all this time.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.840
[Aaron]
This is it.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.680
This is the stuff
Laura used in my dream.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.640
Mom didn't have the
heart to throw them away.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.000
What are you going to do?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.040
We're going to finish
what Laura started.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.160
"To trap a creature
of night,

19:53.160 --> 19:56.720
"trace a door on a wall
with chalk so white.

19:56.720 --> 20:00.000
"Surrounded by
candlelight so pure,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.920
"place incense and herbs
in a brazier to burn.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.000
<i> "Arabarius, lokoradee,</i>

20:05.000 --> 20:07.960
creature of darkness,
come to me."

20:16.120 --> 20:17.480
It worked!

20:18.720 --> 20:21.440
"As darkness enters,
ready his cage,

20:21.440 --> 20:23.600
"a wand made of oak
tied with silver

20:23.600 --> 20:25.600
"will hold the night
creature at bay

20:25.600 --> 20:27.600
"and forbid him
to stray.

20:27.600 --> 20:30.360
"Order the night creature
into the amulet.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.520
<i> "Arabarius, lokoradet,</i>

20:31.520 --> 20:33.560
there he will be
for an eternity kept."

20:38.560 --> 20:39.440
Aah!

20:40.560 --> 20:42.000
[Doug]
Aaron!

20:42.000 --> 20:43.080
Now what?

20:43.080 --> 20:45.160
<i> Arabarius, lokoradet,</i>

20:45.160 --> 20:47.480
I command you,
enter this amulet.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.160
Uh, Aaron!

20:51.120 --> 20:52.600
Aaron,
do something!

20:52.600 --> 20:53.600
[Aaron]
Connie!

20:53.600 --> 20:55.480
I don't know
what to do.

20:55.480 --> 20:56.680
Aaron!

20:56.680 --> 20:58.440
Doug!

20:58.440 --> 21:00.160
Doug!

21:03.200 --> 21:05.400
That thing
has my brother.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.080
I don't know
what went wrong.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.240
We did everything
the books says.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.600
Laura said
she did it wrong.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.480
<i>We must have missed
something. We must have.</i>

21:14.920 --> 21:16.640
It's coming back.

21:18.440 --> 21:20.640
What did we
do wrong?

21:20.640 --> 21:22.360
[Connie]
Aaron, it's coming.

21:22.360 --> 21:25.520
"A wand made of oak
tied with silver will--"

21:25.520 --> 21:26.600
silver.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.280
This isn't silver.
It's steel.

21:37.320 --> 21:39.560
I command you,
stay where you are!

21:42.440 --> 21:44.000
<i> Arabarius, lokoradet,</i>

21:44.000 --> 21:46.720
I command you,
enter the amulet!

21:55.560 --> 21:57.080
What a ride!

21:58.360 --> 21:59.480
You OK?

21:59.480 --> 22:03.320
Yeah. Yeah.
I feel fine.

22:03.320 --> 22:06.280
Guys... look.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.000
I'm sorry I didn't
believe you, Laura.

22:41.080 --> 22:42.440
I miss you.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.920
[Kiki] Because Connie finished
what her sister started,

23:05.920 --> 23:07.440
Doug got better,

23:07.440 --> 23:09.920
and neither ghost
was ever seen again.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.440
The end.

23:11.440 --> 23:15.600
So if you're going to use
magic, make sure you do it right.

23:19.440 --> 23:23.440
I declare this meeting
of the Midnight Society closed.

23:29.560 --> 23:31.640
[Thunder]

23:36.400 --> 23:38.320
I didn't do it!

23:38.320 --> 23:40.920
I didn't do it.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.000
Wait for me!
