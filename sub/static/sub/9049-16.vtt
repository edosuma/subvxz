00:05.839 --> 00:10.175
Guys, I just found out that my Harvard
interview is going to happen here,

00:10.177 --> 00:13.278
so I need to showcase my
proudest achievements.

00:13.280 --> 00:19.218
Like being runner-up in a macaroni
necklace making contest when you were six?

00:19.220 --> 00:21.553
I'll put that one
back in the box.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.822
You can use my trophy.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.691
It's for world's best son.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.459
My dad got it for my brother.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.294
You don't have a brother.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.930
Aww, that makes it extra sad.

00:33.733 --> 00:35.534
I can't believe you already
have an interview.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.403
College applications
aren't due for months.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.204
I applied for early admission.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.840
Harvard has been my dream
school since I've been little.

00:41.842 --> 00:44.543
My mom went there, and I want
to follow in her footsteps.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.912
Well, you're a shoo-in.
You have straight A's,

00:46.914 --> 00:50.349
perfect attendance, not to mention
all of your musical achievements.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.684
Plus, you're adorable.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.853
That junk means
nothing to Harvard.

00:54.855 --> 00:57.189
The only kid from our school
to get accepted last year

00:57.191 --> 01:00.926
climbed mount Kilimanjaro, then
wrote a best-seller about it,

01:00.928 --> 01:03.829
then adapted it into a
movie and starred in it.

01:03.831 --> 01:06.665
And he was waitlisted.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.868
Ooh, I know how you can
impress your interviewer.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.670
You could invent something,

01:11.672 --> 01:14.440
like a magic box with wheels
that drives you places.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.275
A car?

01:16.277 --> 01:21.013
Oh. Well, what about a machine that
you type on that knows everything?

01:21.015 --> 01:22.714
A computer?

01:22.716 --> 01:27.853
Oh. Well, what about something you eat
that's round and filled with jelly?

01:27.855 --> 01:30.355
A jelly donut, like the
one you're holding?

01:33.626 --> 01:35.394
Oh.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.196
Well, I guess everything
has been invented...

01:37.198 --> 01:38.931
And you're never going
to college, Ally.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074

02:35.688 --> 02:37.156
Oh, hey, Trish.

02:37.158 --> 02:39.024
I'm prepping for my
Harvard interview.

02:39.026 --> 02:42.261
Which looks smarter...
this one or this one?

02:42.263 --> 02:46.265
Mm, they both look dumb, because
you don't need glasses.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.667
And they don't even
have any lenses.

02:50.203 --> 02:52.838
Guys, we have some
terrible news.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.774
Are you sitting down for this?

02:55.776 --> 02:57.476
Our favorite ride
is being shut down.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.944
"The star ship."

02:58.946 --> 03:00.479
We used to ride it
every day as kids.

03:00.481 --> 03:03.549
Only the bravest astronauts
would make it back alive.

03:03.551 --> 03:07.553
It's the scariest, best, most
exciting ride in the world,

03:07.555 --> 03:11.523
and we have to go on it again before
they close it down forever. Come on.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.026
Ta-dah!

03:14.028 --> 03:17.996
This is the scariest, best, most
exciting ride in the world?

03:17.998 --> 03:20.299
Uh, yeah. Whoo!

03:21.501 --> 03:24.536
I guess it was a little more
terrifying when we were kids.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.639
I guess it was a little bigger too.
It must have shrunk.

03:29.375 --> 03:33.378
Astro-Austin and
astro-Dez blasting off!

03:33.380 --> 03:35.814
Whee!

03:35.816 --> 03:38.183
Whee!

03:38.185 --> 03:40.052
Whee!

03:41.221 --> 03:44.523
Whee! Whee!

03:44.525 --> 03:47.492
My interviewer will
be here any minute,

03:47.494 --> 03:50.195
and I'm trying to make a
list of my accomplishments.

03:50.197 --> 03:54.233
Why isn't this pen working?

03:54.235 --> 03:56.935
Because it's a carrot.

03:58.705 --> 04:00.672
I'm freaking out.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.574
Interviews are easy.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.444
Just make up a bunch of stuff
about yourself that sounds good.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.679
That's what I always do.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.548
But I don't want to lie.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.916
It's not lying.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.585
It's just saying stuff
that isn't true.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.554
How do you think I
always get hired?

04:15.556 --> 04:18.890
I don't speak mandarin, I can't
type 200 words per minute,

04:18.892 --> 04:22.127
and I certainly don't
work well with others.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.564
Ally?

04:25.566 --> 04:29.301
You must be miss Jackson.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.376
Please, you can call me Sydney.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.443
Great.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.612
And you can call me Ally.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.915
Oh, you already did.

04:43.917 --> 04:46.518
Look at us, bantering.

04:48.254 --> 04:52.491
So, Ally, tell me
about yourself.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.459
How long have you
been playing music?

04:54.461 --> 04:56.595
Since I was two.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.163
No, 35.

04:58.165 --> 05:01.333
No, kangaroo. Wait,
that's not even a number.

05:01.335 --> 05:05.103
Sorry to interrupt, but Ally's
lifetime achievement award

05:05.105 --> 05:07.339
from the vice president
just arrived.

05:07.341 --> 05:08.740
Do you want me to hang it up

05:08.742 --> 05:10.742
with the rest of your
lifetime achievement awards?

05:10.744 --> 05:12.277
Wow.

05:12.279 --> 05:15.180
A lifetime achievement award,
and from the vice president.

05:15.182 --> 05:18.950
Well, not the vice
president vice president.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.987
More like the vice
vice president...

05:21.989 --> 05:24.923
Of Florida.

05:26.693 --> 05:30.562
Now please, Trish, no
more interruptions.

05:32.598 --> 05:35.967
So, Ally, tell me about
your music factory.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.770
So I know you said no
more interruptions,

05:38.772 --> 05:43.008
but the Einstein foundation is on the
phone with an emergency math problem

05:43.010 --> 05:45.344
that only you can solve.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.782
Hello, Einstein foundation.

05:50.784 --> 05:57.456
Hmm, well, the answer
is obviously 39.

05:58.891 --> 06:00.792
No, you're the smartest.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.662
No, you're the smartest.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.664
No, you're the smartest.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.767
No, you're the smartest.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.806
You know what, Austin? You
should apply to Harvard.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.742
You really think I'd have
a chance of getting in?

06:16.744 --> 06:18.744
Oh, not the Harvard
Ally's applying to.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.546
I mean "Harvvard"
with two "v's."

06:21.548 --> 06:23.682
It's an online college.
They'll take anyone.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.017
Dez, I don't want to
think about that.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.686
Let's just enjoy the
time we have left

06:27.688 --> 06:29.554
on the star ship before
it closes forever.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.823
You're right. Just think
of all the little kids

06:31.825 --> 06:34.092
who won't be able to make
happy memories on this ride.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.027
Yeah, like us.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.530
We want to make some
happy memories.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.932
Scram, you! We called dibs.

06:43.169 --> 06:47.339
Hey, remember when we made that
best friend adventure challenge,

06:47.341 --> 06:49.775
to see if we could ride this
thing 100 times in a row?

06:49.777 --> 06:51.610
100 times?

06:51.612 --> 06:55.080
Some of us have never
even ridden it one time.

06:55.082 --> 06:58.250
Of course I remember. We
never made it through.

06:58.252 --> 07:01.286
Something always got in the
way, mostly our bedtimes

07:01.288 --> 07:04.189
and the fact that you
always missed your mommy.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.358
Now is our chance
to make it to 100

07:06.360 --> 07:08.226
before they close
the ride forever.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.761
Great. I came prepared.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.467
Starting now. Here we go.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.969
Ride number one.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.805
Whee!

07:19.807 --> 07:22.274
Whee! Whee!

07:22.276 --> 07:24.810
Whee!

07:24.812 --> 07:27.412
Whee!

07:27.414 --> 07:29.815
Whee!

07:29.817 --> 07:32.551
Okay, almost there.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.885
Ride 99.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.487
I'm not gonna make it.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.622
We can do it. We're so close.

07:45.565 --> 07:47.766
Dez, Dez, are you okay?

07:47.768 --> 07:54.172
Maybe that second burrito at lunch
wasn't a great idea, or the third.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.774
I'm sorry.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.710
We came so close, but
I ruined everything.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.847
It's okay, astro-buddy.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.982
We can do it again tomorrow.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.654
Guess whose best friend
got accepted to Harvard?

08:13.125 --> 08:16.928
I got accepted into Harvard?

08:16.930 --> 08:20.098
That's wild. I
didn't even apply.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.133
I'm talking about Ally.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.302
Well, we don't know
I got accepted yet.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.471
I just got my decision letter.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.673
Yeah, but it's the big envelope.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.308
What's the big envelope mean?

08:30.310 --> 08:32.844
The big envelope means that
there's a welcome packet inside,

08:32.846 --> 08:34.846
which means you're accepted.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.816
The small envelope means that
there's no welcome packet inside,

08:37.818 --> 08:39.717
so that's a rejection.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.020
I got the big envelope, so...

08:42.022 --> 08:43.722
That's great.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.524
I wanted to be with you
guys when I open it,

08:45.526 --> 08:47.392
so we could celebrate
this moment together.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.960
Well, what are you waiting for?
Open it.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.696
Open it, open it, open it, open it,
open it, open it, open it, open it.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.298
Okay, okay.

09:02.909 --> 09:06.878
Maybe there's a big envelope
inside the small envelope?

09:16.889 --> 09:19.791
I got rejected.

09:24.196 --> 09:25.830
I think I'm gonna be sick.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.732
Ooh.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.012
Poor Ally.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.014
Getting into Harvard
was her dream.

09:43.016 --> 09:46.918
Apparently the admissions office
said her interview didn't go well,

09:46.920 --> 09:50.088
which is hard to believe, because
we told some pretty great lies.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.524
Well, Ally's always gotten
everything she wanted...

09:52.526 --> 09:56.227
the perfect grades, the perfect
career, the perfect man.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.563
Something had to burst
her bubble eventually.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.202
Okay, now this is weird.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.471
Ally's never been
late to class before.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.942
Ally. Good. You're here.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.712
The teacher was just about
to collect our homework.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.914
Yeah, I didn't do it.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.816
Ha-ha. Very funny.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.618
I'm being serious, dude.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.152
I didn't do the homework.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.288
Trish, what's happening?

10:23.290 --> 10:24.956
I'm scared.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.994
Okay, dude, you dudes
all need to chillax.

10:31.831 --> 10:33.898
Do you feel okay?

10:33.900 --> 10:35.800
I feel better than okay.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.870
I feel, uh, buh-doo-buh-doo.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.108
Buh-doo-buh-what?

10:43.110 --> 10:46.778
Saying words that make
sense is for chumps, dude.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.414
I say "dude" now.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.950
We noticed.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.119
Ally, this isn't you.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.754
It's the new me.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.023
The old me who set goals
and got good grades,

10:58.025 --> 10:59.924
only to have her
dreams dashed...

10:59.926 --> 11:01.960
that girl is gone.

11:01.962 --> 11:05.997
And new Ally is gonna sit at...

11:05.999 --> 11:08.299
The back of the class.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.006
But you always said
the back of the class

11:15.008 --> 11:17.442
is for no-good-nicks
and ne'er-do-wells.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.978
This is not good.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.546
I don't know.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.048
I kind of like this new Ally.

11:25.551 --> 11:28.586
What? Go ahead and teach, dude.

11:34.627 --> 11:38.129
Whee! Whee!

11:38.131 --> 11:40.165
What's wrong? Why aren't
you saying "whee"?

11:40.167 --> 11:42.000
I'm worried about Ally.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.202
Eh, she'll be fine. And we
have bigger fish to fry,

11:44.204 --> 11:48.239
like finishing our best friend adventure
challenge of 100 rides in a row.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.241
We've been here so long,
I think I've lost track.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.743
What number are we at?

11:51.745 --> 11:55.847
109. I've been keeping count.

11:55.849 --> 11:58.183
I thought I told
you to scram, kid.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.984
Wait.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.352
109?

12:01.354 --> 12:03.822
That means we passed 100.
We did it.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.691
Best friend adventure
challenge accomplished.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.226
100!

12:08.228 --> 12:10.328
And nine.

12:12.231 --> 12:15.533
So, now what?

12:15.535 --> 12:18.336
You could get off the ride and
give someone else a turn.

12:18.338 --> 12:21.272
But then we'll never
see it again.

12:21.274 --> 12:24.042
What if we make a new best
friend adventure challenge

12:24.044 --> 12:26.077
to make sure the movers
don't take this ride away?

12:26.079 --> 12:28.780
Yeah, we could attach
ourselves to it.

12:30.049 --> 12:32.383
Good thing I brought this
industrial strength glue...

12:32.385 --> 12:34.486
a classic protester move.

12:39.391 --> 12:41.059
You've got to be kidding me.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.794
You guys are the worst.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.966
Let's see 'em get us
off this ride now.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.435
Yeah.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.308
Maybe we should have checked the
weather before we did this.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.711
Don't worry, buddy.
I've got an umbrella.

12:59.713 --> 13:02.313
It came with the tropical
smoothie I got earlier.

13:12.091 --> 13:15.260
Ally, you can't hide
up here all day.

13:15.262 --> 13:18.897
We have a music factory to run, and
I can't keep covering for you.

13:18.899 --> 13:22.133
I've already skipped
two naps today.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.503
Why would anyone want to take
lessons from a loser like me?

13:25.505 --> 13:27.138
You're not a loser.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.909
But, ugh, what is that smell?

13:30.911 --> 13:34.445
Old pizza and dead dreams.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.949
Ally, I know this
might sounds crazy,

13:37.951 --> 13:40.118
but maybe lying isn't
always a good thing.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.187
I'm not mad.

13:42.189 --> 13:47.492
I'm the one who messed up, but
I don't feel bad about it.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.427
You don't?

13:49.429 --> 13:50.995
Well, good.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.764
Here, I got you this book.

13:52.766 --> 13:54.999
It lists every
college in America.

13:55.001 --> 13:58.002
Did you know there's another
Harvard, spelled with two "v's"?

13:58.004 --> 14:01.172
And you don't even need an
application, just a credit card.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.274
Trish, you don't get it.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.443
The point is Harvard
is just one college.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.045
It's not that big a deal.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.112
Exactly.

14:08.114 --> 14:11.049
College isn't that
big of a deal.

14:11.051 --> 14:16.621
Which is why I've decided not
to go to college at all.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.857
But, Ally...

14:21.126 --> 14:23.027
I changed my mind.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.830
Oh, thank goodness. You're
gonna apply to college?

14:25.832 --> 14:30.435
No, I changed my mind about how much
pizza I'm gonna eat this afternoon.

14:44.216 --> 14:47.051
- Hey, Ally.
- Oh, you got us pizza?

14:47.053 --> 14:49.187
No, this box is empty...

14:49.189 --> 14:52.423
Like my life.

14:52.425 --> 14:55.260
I'm on my way to return
all my library cards.

14:55.262 --> 14:58.363
Now that I'm not going to college,
what's the point of reading?

14:58.365 --> 15:00.231
Okay, see ya.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.268
Wait, say what now?

15:03.270 --> 15:05.169
Ally, seriously, wait.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.171
I can't chase you. I'm
glued to this rocket.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.339
What?

15:08.341 --> 15:12.076
I know it sounds crazy, but what
you're doing is even crazier.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.412
What's going on with you?

15:14.414 --> 15:19.417
Ever since I got rejected from
Harvard, everything seems pointless.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.252
What's the big deal
about Harvard anyway?

15:21.254 --> 15:23.121
Just because it's the best
school in the country

15:23.123 --> 15:25.456
doesn't mean it's that great.

15:26.425 --> 15:30.728
Going to a college like that
is a life-changing experience.

15:30.730 --> 15:34.098
But isn't your life
already great?

15:34.100 --> 15:38.136
You've got your music
career, the factory, me.

15:38.138 --> 15:41.973
Isn't that pretty good,
especially the me part?

15:42.908 --> 15:44.909
It is.

15:44.911 --> 15:49.280
I guess I just got obsessed with
trying to be the kind of person

15:49.282 --> 15:51.149
Harvard would think is special.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.151
But you are special.

15:53.153 --> 15:58.189
Each of us is a star that takes
our own special journey.

15:59.558 --> 16:03.494
Austin, when did you get
so deep and insightful?

16:03.496 --> 16:05.763
Oh, I was just
reading that sign.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.003
That makes more sense.

16:12.005 --> 16:15.340
You know, I can't
keep fooling myself.

16:15.342 --> 16:19.577
I still love school, and I
still want to go to college.

16:19.579 --> 16:23.014
It's time to get back to
what's important to me.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.249
Thanks for helping
me see that, Austin.

16:28.087 --> 16:29.854
Aww.

16:29.856 --> 16:32.357
Okay, Ally, time for you to go.

16:34.026 --> 16:36.194
I'm gonna go wash my hair

16:36.196 --> 16:39.030
and change into some clothes
that don't smell like pizza.

16:41.500 --> 16:45.670
I think maybe talking about college
has us all a little freaked out.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.473
Maybe that's why we're hanging
out on this ride so much.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.208
Duh.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.977
This ride is a metaphor symbolizing
our fear of growing up.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.979
Seeing Ally go forward
into adulthood,

16:54.981 --> 16:57.548
represented by college, caused
us to regress into childhood,

16:57.550 --> 17:00.618
represented by this
juvenile ride.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.720
What? Ally's not the
only smart one.

17:05.391 --> 17:07.224
We should get off
this thing, Dez.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.559
We've had our fun.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.561
Yeah, we can't hold onto
our childhoods forever.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.298
It's time we blossom, like
two cocooned butterflies,

17:14.300 --> 17:17.068
into grown-up, brave
butterfly men.

17:20.571 --> 17:22.573
How are we gonna
get off this ride?

17:22.575 --> 17:24.709
Our pants are still stuck.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.578
Goodbye, childhood.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.380
Goodbye, pants.

17:31.417 --> 17:34.385
- Hey, guys.
- I'm not crying. You're crying.

17:35.354 --> 17:37.355
You finally got off the ride?

17:37.357 --> 17:39.023
Yep.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.359
You know you left your
pants on it, right?

17:41.361 --> 17:43.428
Yep.

17:43.430 --> 17:48.633
This is astro-Austin and
astro-Dez, signing off.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.574
Here, astro-little-boy.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.409
You deserve this.

18:02.214 --> 18:04.015
Best ride ever, right?

18:04.017 --> 18:06.050
Totally worth the wait?

18:06.052 --> 18:08.419
Eh, not that great.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.630
I'm rich!

18:25.370 --> 18:29.941
I can't believe I got so turned around
in the college admissions process

18:29.943 --> 18:32.410
that I forgot how important
the music factory is to me.

18:32.412 --> 18:36.647
And I'm glad I'm teaching kids,
instead of trying to act like one.

18:40.252 --> 18:42.553
Bubbles.

18:43.989 --> 18:46.824
Miss Jackson, what
are you doing here?

18:46.826 --> 18:52.430
Well, your friend Trish sent me these
letters from your music students.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.833
I may not have met the real
Ally during our interview,

18:55.835 --> 18:59.437
but these letter have given me a
glimpse of who you really are.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.272
Trish, you did this?

19:01.274 --> 19:03.774
Yep.

19:03.776 --> 19:08.179
"Dear Ally," thank you for
always believing in me.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.948
"I want to be just like
you when I grow up."

19:10.950 --> 19:17.688
"Ally is the prettiest, bestest,
"smartestest teacher in the world."

19:17.690 --> 19:20.958
Aww, isn't that the cutestest?

19:20.960 --> 19:24.962
Look, I am sorry about
that interview.

19:24.964 --> 19:29.367
I should have stuck to talking about
the things that I've actually done,

19:29.369 --> 19:31.202
because that's what
I'm really proud of.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.371
You know, you look just
like my aunt ruthie,

19:33.373 --> 19:36.874
but people must tell
you that all the time.

19:36.876 --> 19:41.112
Ignore him. He's a doof, and
people tell him that all the time.

19:41.114 --> 19:48.519
Anyway, Ally, you have turned your
dreams into a flourishing career,

19:48.521 --> 19:52.056
and now you help others achieve
their dreams with your school.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.959
This makes you a very
special young woman.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.360
Thank you.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.563
Which is why I'm here now.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.966
I'd like to offer you a
do-over on your interview.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.068
Really?

20:04.070 --> 20:06.070
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait, right now?

20:06.072 --> 20:08.005
Because I didn't have
any time to prepare.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.575
Maybe that's a good thing.

20:12.477 --> 20:15.313
Are you sure you're
not my aunt ruthie?

20:15.315 --> 20:17.748
Because you have the
exact same whiskers.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.658
Hey, guys. What's up?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.894
Uh...

20:29.896 --> 20:31.762
Your decision letter
from Harvard came.

20:31.764 --> 20:35.600
Sorry, it's the small envelope.

20:37.202 --> 20:39.837
You know what? It's okay.

20:39.839 --> 20:43.241
I was honest in the
interview, and I did my best.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.610
Harvard or no Harvard,
I'm proud of myself.

21:12.904 --> 21:14.805
I got in! I got in!

21:14.807 --> 21:16.474
I'm going to Harvard!

21:16.476 --> 21:18.876
- That's incredible.
- I'm so proud of you.

21:18.878 --> 21:21.545
Guys, I have the
most amazing news.

21:21.547 --> 21:24.048
We do too. Ally
got into Harvard.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.817
Oh, that's pretty good news,
but my news is even better.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.453
Remember how sad we were that
they were closing the star ship?

21:29.455 --> 21:31.656
Well, guess what. They
weren't closing it.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.491
They were just moving it.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.126
Really? After all that?

21:35.128 --> 21:39.230
They moved it right outside
the music factory. Whoo!

21:39.232 --> 21:41.932
Awesome!

21:41.934 --> 21:47.338
I mean, we're grown-up men who don't
care about kiddy rides anymore.

21:47.340 --> 21:48.739
Oh, yeah.

21:48.741 --> 21:51.642
We've blossomed into
beautiful, manly butterflies.

21:53.278 --> 21:54.845
Maybe one little
ride wouldn't hurt.

21:54.847 --> 21:58.649
Yes! Astro-Austin and
astro-Dez are blasting off.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.787
What do you say, astro-Trish?

22:02.789 --> 22:04.422
Want to ride into space?

22:04.424 --> 22:07.325
Why not, astro-Ally?

22:08.327 --> 22:10.795
Hey, kid, give me
back those quarters!

22:10.797 --> 22:12.897
Never!
