01:06.483 --> 01:07.815
Take it, brother.

01:56.742 --> 01:57.823
Let me break you.

02:02.706 --> 02:03.913
Man, that was funky. Heh.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.172
Hmm?

03:00.639 --> 03:02.551
Whoa! Ah.

03:05.477 --> 03:08.970
- Fore!
- Well, heh, I guess the meeting's started.

03:10.607 --> 03:14.317
- Howdy, sir?
- Mahoney, heh! Jones, heh!

03:14.820 --> 03:16.686
Thank you, Sweetchuck.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.861
I've had the most wonderful news
about my new program, heh.

03:26.498 --> 03:29.912
- What new program is that, sir?
- My citizens on patrol.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.743
I call it C.O.P. for short.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.082
Has a nice "police-y" ring to it,
don't you think?

03:34.297 --> 03:35.458
What is C.O.P., sir?

03:39.052 --> 03:41.385
What is the most frustrating thing
about police work?

03:41.596 --> 03:45.180
- Not being able to carry hand grenades.
- Separate locker rooms, sir.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.054
Icky blue uniforms.

03:47.310 --> 03:50.098
I always thought
that the most frustrating thing was that...

03:50.313 --> 03:53.147
...we couldn't be everywhere at once
to solve every crime.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.396
So the public ends up
thinking of us as enemies.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.192
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if we could all be friends?

04:00.615 --> 04:03.779
Ah, officer Mahoney, please come in.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.028
Have some lemonade. I love lemonade.

04:07.497 --> 04:11.832
- Not too tart, not--
- Too sweet, just, mm, mm, good.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.589
So C.O.P. is
a community action program, sir.

04:19.801 --> 04:24.091
- Like Neighborhood Watch?
- More. Much more!

04:24.723 --> 04:26.806
We show the community that we care.

04:27.017 --> 04:31.637
We train volunteers in crime detection,
in first-aid and...

04:32.105 --> 04:35.724
- And it's a great idea, sir.
- But we need citizen support.

04:36.318 --> 04:39.026
With all this neighborhood crime,
I'm sure you'll get it.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.103
- Fore!
- Right. What if we were to...

04:43.033 --> 04:45.195
- What was that?
- Unh...

04:45.452 --> 04:47.444
I believe brother Sweetchuck
is suggesting...

04:47.662 --> 04:49.619
...we recruit in our old neighborhood.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.824
Excellent. We have the full support
of the mayor...

04:53.043 --> 04:57.083
...and best of all, the governor of the state
wants me to unveil the program...

04:57.297 --> 05:00.711
...at the end of
the International Police Seminar...

05:00.926 --> 05:02.417
...next month in England.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.048
While I attend the seminar...

05:05.263 --> 05:08.176
...you, my good friends...

05:08.391 --> 05:10.428
...will put C.O.P. into action.

05:10.727 --> 05:14.266
We'll change community relations
all around the world.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.936
The Lassard Method.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.477
It rolls nicely off the tongue,
don't you think?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.984
Hi! What did I miss?

05:30.664 --> 05:32.121
Hi.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.664
<i>Mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread</i>

05:45.095 --> 05:47.758
Uh, Capt. Harris,
Police Commissioner Hurst is here.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.089
You want to see him?

05:49.307 --> 05:50.969
No. Send him packing.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.434
Yes, sir.

05:53.645 --> 05:56.058
- Proctor!
- Yes, sir?

05:56.273 --> 05:58.765
Send the Commissioner in immediately.

05:58.984 --> 06:02.148
- I thought you said to send him packing.
- Immediately!

06:02.362 --> 06:03.569
Yes, sir.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.405
Nincompoop.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.650
Commissioner.

06:11.079 --> 06:14.072
- You have a problem, Capt. Harris?
- Uh, yes, sir.

06:14.291 --> 06:18.911
Commissioner, I am extremely concerned
with this memorandum from Lassard...

06:19.129 --> 06:21.872
...about his C.O.P. program.

06:22.841 --> 06:26.505
Citizens doing police work?
An asinine idea.

06:26.887 --> 06:31.598
If this goes through, no policeman's job,
no policeman's paycheck, will be safe.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.219
Are you through, captain?

06:33.435 --> 06:38.055
The governor of this state thinks
that this program is absolutely brilliant.

06:38.773 --> 06:42.983
So until he changes his mind,
that's what you and I think too.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.568
Agreed?

06:44.779 --> 06:47.487
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.239
You were right.
You should have sent him packing.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.580
I don't give a damn
what the governor or the mayor thinks.

06:59.794 --> 07:03.083
Lassard's program is a mistake...

07:03.882 --> 07:06.875
...and anyone who thinks otherwise
is wrong.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.169
Pure and simple.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.880
Don't touch those!

07:13.433 --> 07:16.392
Don't you ever touch my balls
without asking!

07:32.827 --> 07:36.491
You're gonna have to leave.
I'll call the police. I mean it.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.915
Okay, I'm going. I'm out of here.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.582
Wait a minute. I am the police.

07:44.464 --> 07:48.799
- No, you're not.
- That's me. I'm here to speak about C.O.P.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.471
I'm sorry. I didn't...
Without the uniform on--

07:54.683 --> 07:58.142
Regular human clothes
make people more comfortable.

07:59.646 --> 08:04.107
Hi, ladies. Let's do some poetry!

08:11.825 --> 08:14.363
I got to go to my in-laws'
for dinner tonight.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.653
You want to come?

08:19.082 --> 08:22.792
Officer Hightower,
I'm here to join the new C.O.P. Program.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.250
Do I know you?

08:24.462 --> 08:26.545
Yeah, you used to bounce me on your knee.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.998
- I did?
- Yeah. Little Tommy Conklin.

08:29.217 --> 08:33.302
- But now they call me House.
- Tommy Conklin. Tommy Conklin.

08:33.554 --> 08:38.265
Sure. Welcome aboard.
You can register right over there.

08:51.364 --> 08:55.779
<i>Blind mouth that scare themselves</i>

08:56.494 --> 08:59.532
<i>Know how to hold a sheep hook</i>

09:00.373 --> 09:03.411
<i>Or have learned aught else at least</i>

09:03.918 --> 09:08.663
<i>That to the faithful herdsmans' art belongs</i>

09:19.267 --> 09:20.883
Whoa! Ah, that was exciting.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.263
We have an, uh, Officer Zed,
who's here to tell us...

09:25.482 --> 09:28.725
...a little bit about my new police program.
So won't you...

09:33.281 --> 09:35.022
Thank you very much.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.570
Oof. I'm sorry.
I'm an emotional, sensitive guy...

09:42.499 --> 09:46.038
...and that part about the sheep hook
just tore my heart right out. Um...

09:47.128 --> 09:49.916
I have my own poem
that I prepared for you today.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.881
<i>Gene, Gene made a machine</i>

09:53.593 --> 09:55.630
<i>And Joe, Joe made it go</i>

09:55.845 --> 10:01.307
<i>I blew a fart
and blew the whole damn thing apart</i>

10:02.769 --> 10:04.431
What is he saying?

10:06.731 --> 10:08.393
I didn't write it.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.443
Ahem, okay, I'd like to talk to you
about what we're here for...

10:12.654 --> 10:15.647
...and that's for me to pitch
the new C.O.P. program to you.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.403
Perhaps a few of you ladies
might be interested in it.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.529
So the bartender asked the organ grinder,

10:23.748 --> 10:25.614
"Hey, does your monkey sing any
opera?"

10:26.084 --> 10:27.746
And I said, "Nope.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.578
But if you hit me on the head,
I'll sing <i>Yankee Doodle."</i>

10:37.929 --> 10:41.093
Ooh, it's so nice to have my family
all back together again.

10:44.936 --> 10:48.520
- Can you pass the lettuce, Pop?
- Oh, sure, honey. Here you go.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.848
- Thanks, Pop.
- You're welcome. Hey, listen...

10:51.025 --> 10:53.859
...did I tell you I'm gonna join
that Citizen On Patrol thing?

10:54.070 --> 10:57.529
That would be a great idea.
I'd be proud to have you at the precinct.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.857
- Ah.
- I'll take some more greens, Bud.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.362
- Dad.
- Yeah?

11:01.786 --> 11:05.450
I don't think you should sign up.
There are already three of us on the force.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.908
- It's going to look like favoritism.
- That's not it.

11:09.794 --> 11:13.708
That's not it at all. You just don't think
I'm fast enough anymore, do you?

11:17.552 --> 11:20.044
- I don't think that's it, do you, Tack?
- Ahem, mm.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.596
It has nothing to do with being fast.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.345
- Ah.
- Now, that was fast, huh?

11:25.560 --> 11:28.428
Ahem. You know, that was fast.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.556
But that's hard.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.481
- Ooh, oh, oh.
- Excuse me. Ha-ha.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.489
I think Bud hurt Pop's feelings.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.454
Oh, you two.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.579
Ow, ow, ow.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.875
Oh, well, who wants pie?

12:01.930 --> 12:03.717
Mm.

12:04.933 --> 12:07.550
- I was just trying to help.
- You hurt my arm.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.102
- I'll hand the rest out. Hi.
- Hi.

12:10.313 --> 12:13.431
Could I interest you
in the new citizens program?

12:13.650 --> 12:15.562
- Ah, heh, no, I don't think so.
- No, thanks.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.897
- We'll take the stairs.
- Thanks, just the same.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.855
Excuse me!

12:21.407 --> 12:24.696
Would you be interested
in the new citizens program?

12:25.370 --> 12:29.364
- Ah, yes, in fact, we didn't hear you right.
- Sure, here.

12:29.666 --> 12:33.785
- Why don't you hand the rest of them out?
- Thank you very much. Goodbye, sir.

12:39.050 --> 12:43.010
- Arnie, where are you going?
- Home. I got a boatload of stuff to do.

12:43.221 --> 12:46.134
I got a term paper due tomorrow,
and a history test.

12:46.349 --> 12:50.559
I got to help my father clean the cellar,
and I have to do the dishes tonight.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.806
- Tsk.
- What are you doing?

12:52.021 --> 12:55.139
- I'll get the guys and hang out at the mall.
- Let's go.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.151
Hey, Artie, Kyle.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.656
I thought I told you guys,
no skateboarding in my district.

13:03.866 --> 13:07.780
This isn't skateboarding, sergeant.
This is carrying skateboards.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.414
This is skateboarding.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.663
- We got to check this out, you guys.
- Take it easy.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.210
We'll see you later.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.926
I'll see you later.
I want to check out these guys.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.676
All right, I'll be back.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.994
Hey, sarge, look at that.

15:15.206 --> 15:18.699
- Hm, Kyle, that skateboard punk.
- Let's nail him.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.251
Boy, you sure give them a hard time.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.829
Yeah. Fun, isn't it?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.505
You don't listen, do you, Kyle?

15:32.723 --> 15:35.136
I was shopping
for Capt. Harris' birthday present.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.808
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.430
Shop somewhere else.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.681
Oh, Your Honor, uh...

15:43.860 --> 15:47.194
Here, judge. Stop him! Hold up!

15:47.405 --> 15:50.239
Excuse me, pardon me.
Excuse me, my fault.

15:51.451 --> 15:55.195
- Watch it!
- Stop! Stop that skateboarder! Hold it!

15:57.081 --> 15:59.573
I can do that, that handstand stuff.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.869
I just hate it
when the change falls out of my pocket.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.757
Hey, man,
I think these guys want to talk to you.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.337
Hold it!

16:14.307 --> 16:16.845
Capt. Harris will hear about this!

16:41.083 --> 16:42.164
Come.

16:43.169 --> 16:46.162
- Sir.
- Copeland, what the hell happened to you?

16:46.380 --> 16:48.793
Some skateboard punks
started a riot at the mall.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.419
Bring them in here.

16:50.635 --> 16:53.002
- They got away.
- They got away?

16:53.221 --> 16:57.306
- I did the best I could, sir.
- It wasn't enough, was it, Copeland?

16:57.642 --> 17:01.386
- No, sir.
- I'll handle these punks personally.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.349
- Yes, sir.
- I want three patrol cars...

17:03.523 --> 17:05.640
...dissecting the neighborhood.
Copeland, my hat!

17:05.816 --> 17:08.103
- Yes, sir.
- You, radio-alert all motorcycle units.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.984
I want a chopper in the air.
Spot these boys on the ground.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.145
Proctor, ride with me.

17:12.323 --> 17:16.657
- Now, Proctor, move it!
- Ah, coming, sir.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.326
Be right there!

17:29.549 --> 17:31.290
There they go!

17:31.717 --> 17:33.504
Back it up. Shh. Quiet!

17:35.346 --> 17:38.305
I said quiet, dickhead.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.554
We've got them now.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.648
I know they came in here.

18:10.256 --> 18:13.340
Unit 6 to Capt. Harris.
We've got them at the end of the alley.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.008
I got you now!

18:15.219 --> 18:17.962
<i>You hold them
right there. We're coming.</i>

18:21.309 --> 18:23.141
<i>Copeland, have you got them?</i>

18:23.352 --> 18:25.184
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

18:25.396 --> 18:27.388
I'm Carey Mahoney of the Police Academy.

18:29.150 --> 18:32.609
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Please. Thank you. You're too kind.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.693
Jones.

18:38.659 --> 18:42.824
It's Harris. Haul ass. Go.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.747
I got you, you little punks.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.958
Freeze, you little hoodlums.
Get your hands off my ass, Proctor.

18:56.177 --> 18:58.920
Get away, Proctor.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.182
Proctor.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.731
No. Don't shake the fence.

19:21.702 --> 19:25.161
Oh, shit. No!

19:29.001 --> 19:30.708
The purpose of this program...

19:30.920 --> 19:34.880
is to develop a better working relationship
between us, the police...

19:35.549 --> 19:38.917
When he says, "Okay, boys and girls,"
we're all gonna...

19:41.138 --> 19:42.754
...and you, the community.

19:46.477 --> 19:50.141
Stop! Stop right there!

19:52.566 --> 19:55.400
You see, the great thing is, this is a first.

19:55.611 --> 20:00.151
The Police Academy has offered to train
you citizens to better protect yourselves.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.404
- You'll be trendsetters.
- Do we get to pack heat?

20:03.619 --> 20:05.155
Uh, heat--

20:11.085 --> 20:13.498
Stop those little punks! Stop them!

20:15.715 --> 20:17.502
You're under arrest!

20:22.179 --> 20:23.340
Are you all right?

20:24.181 --> 20:26.218
Who's laughing now, you little twits?

20:27.685 --> 20:30.018
And your clothes make me want to puke.
I'll tell you that right now.

20:30.229 --> 20:34.143
- Capt. Harris!
- Well, well, Mahoney.

20:34.358 --> 20:37.226
- It's been a long time, sir.
- Hm. So it has.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.357
Well, Motormouth Jones.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.027
Anyone ever tell you
you've got a great tailor, sir?

20:43.242 --> 20:45.279
I mentioned that just last week.

20:45.494 --> 20:50.114
Has anyone told you, Mahoney,
that you're still a little pissant?

20:50.332 --> 20:53.621
- No one whose opinion matters, sir.
- What did Arnie and Kyle do?

20:53.836 --> 20:57.705
Ooh, you know those clowns?
Heh, I should have figured.

20:58.299 --> 21:02.589
Your little pals wrecked a police car,
destroyed a shopping mall...

21:02.803 --> 21:05.136
...harassed citizens, resisted arrest.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.384
Go easy, captain. They're just wacky kids.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.934
Heh, we'll see how those wacky kids
like it in jail.

21:13.564 --> 21:17.854
In all my years on the bench,
I have seen all sorts of public disorder.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.276
Young people must learn to conform...

21:20.488 --> 21:23.481
...to the standards and laws
of civilized society.

21:23.908 --> 21:27.151
In reviewing the testimony
and taking into account...

21:27.369 --> 21:30.737
...your disregard
for public and private property...

21:31.415 --> 21:34.453
...I can reach only one decision:

21:35.920 --> 21:37.456
Guilty as hell.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.295
You flushed me down the toilet!

21:43.761 --> 21:45.002
Before you pass sentence--

21:45.221 --> 21:48.339
They're gonna send me to jail,
and some fat, hairy guy is gonna--

21:48.557 --> 21:51.470
- May I approach the bench, Your Honor?
- Yes, sergeant.

21:51.685 --> 21:56.555
Ah, sir, do we want to expose these boys,
these children to a prison environment?

21:56.774 --> 22:00.188
- Yes.
- May I run my own court, captain?

22:00.402 --> 22:02.564
- You've got a better idea?
- Yes, I do, sir.

22:02.780 --> 22:05.898
Comdt. Lassard has initiated
a new community relations program.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.153
Why not assign these kids...

22:08.327 --> 22:10.740
...to that program
as a form of alternate sentencing?

22:10.955 --> 22:13.789
- That's ridiculous!
- I'll be the judge of that.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.575
I... Excuse me.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.249
I like the sound of this
community relations gig.

22:20.881 --> 22:24.045
Milt Butterworth,
defender of the common man.

22:24.260 --> 22:27.753
Your Honor, look at this list of complaints.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.680
And I quote you directly, sir, when I say--

22:43.153 --> 22:46.942
Gee, sir, I thought you only got
contempt of court for opening your mouth.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.947
Mahoney, I'm warning you.

22:52.162 --> 22:55.326
You keep Lassard's C.O.Ps
out of my precinct.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.456
You don't understand what I'm trying to do.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.743
I understand
exactly what you're trying to do.

22:59.920 --> 23:03.288
Just keep them out,
especially these two little buttwads.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.999
Excuse me, sir,
but you're not planning to attack us...

23:06.218 --> 23:08.881
...with any more of your bodily functions,
are you?

23:11.432 --> 23:15.767
You just make sure
that we never meet again. Ever.

23:17.479 --> 23:21.018
You know, with those two idiots
in Lassard's program, it'll never work.

23:48.385 --> 23:49.796
Excuse me, sir.

23:50.012 --> 23:52.174
We're looking for a Mrs. Feldman.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.221
- Do you know her?
- Yes.

24:02.399 --> 24:05.187
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you know a Mrs. Lois--

24:05.402 --> 24:08.270
- Where can we find Lois Feldman, please?
- There.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.405
Thank you.

24:17.039 --> 24:18.280
Mrs. Feldman?

24:18.499 --> 24:20.286
- Who's asking?
- Police.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.410
Is it about those damn library books?

24:24.588 --> 24:28.832
We're following up on your alleged
interest in the Citizens On Patrol program.

24:29.051 --> 24:32.215
Ooh, then I'm Mrs. Feldman. Come on in.

24:34.890 --> 24:37.928
Callahan, cover your rear.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.687
I admire your taste.

24:50.906 --> 24:54.946
Yes, well, I do all my own decorating.

24:56.245 --> 24:58.077
You have a talent for it, ma'am.

24:58.288 --> 25:00.450
I'll be with you in a moment, sarge.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.951
Uh, perhaps you'd like to discuss
the program first, ma'am.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.580
What's to discuss?

25:05.796 --> 25:09.255
Think I want to hang out here
and listen to arteries hardening, heh?

25:09.633 --> 25:11.875
Where did I put that bulletproof vest?

25:25.983 --> 25:29.317
All right, fall in! Come on, please, line up.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.394
Come on, I need a lineup here.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.189
Hello, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen--

25:39.079 --> 25:41.992
- Thank you, Miss...
- Mrs. Feldman.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.286
Mrs. Feldman.

26:03.270 --> 26:06.138
I want to welcome all of you
to the Academy.

26:06.356 --> 26:11.021
You are part of a new
and exciting program that I call...

26:11.487 --> 26:14.355
- ...I call C.O.P.
- C.O.P.

26:16.033 --> 26:19.071
- Citizens On Patrol.
- Citizens On Patrol.

26:19.453 --> 26:22.196
- Citizens On Patrol!
- Citizens On Patrol!

26:23.582 --> 26:26.245
You will work and train with the police.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.747
The police will work and train with you.

26:29.171 --> 26:32.835
Working and training,
training and working.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.541
Excuse me, commandant.

26:34.760 --> 26:38.094
But do you expect the community
to do the job of the police force?

26:38.305 --> 26:42.470
There are many, many jobs
for many, many people.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.177
Sir, I'll take care of this.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.309
Excuse me, young lady,
what the commandant means...

26:48.524 --> 26:50.937
...is that this program
will promote understanding...

26:51.110 --> 26:53.102
...between the community and the police...

26:53.278 --> 26:56.646
...and make the community
more active in crime prevention.

26:57.241 --> 26:59.153
Active in crime prevention?

27:00.619 --> 27:04.112
- Won't that be dangerous?
- No. We just want to teach citizens...

27:04.331 --> 27:06.448
...to prevent crimes from taking place.

27:06.667 --> 27:10.911
It sounds fine in theory.
Let's hope it works in practice.

27:14.424 --> 27:16.632
I like him. He's a really nice fish.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.506
He looks a little like you.

27:22.432 --> 27:25.846
I will attend
an international police seminar in London.

27:26.061 --> 27:29.600
It would be
the crowning achievement of my career...

27:30.107 --> 27:31.939
...if I could close this seminar...

27:32.151 --> 27:35.235
...by bringing instructors
from all around the world...

27:35.445 --> 27:39.780
...here to watch
the C.O.P. program in action.

27:40.742 --> 27:45.157
I'm counting on all of you
to make that possible.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.614
In Comdt. Lassard's absence...

27:47.833 --> 27:51.292
...I've appointed a very able-bodied
and experienced officer...

27:51.503 --> 27:52.835
...to run the Academy.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.373
Ah. Perfect timing. Here he is now.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.296
Attention!

28:12.524 --> 28:15.141
Two weeks of Harris? Damn!

28:21.158 --> 28:22.274
Damn.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.072
- Uh, uh...
- Deodorant? Thanks.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.663
Straighten this mess up.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.415
- What mess?
- Now!

28:36.089 --> 28:39.082
I want all of you dirtbags
and that group of C.O.P. people...

28:39.301 --> 28:42.044
...out in front of this dormitory
at 1400 hours.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.261
Move it!

28:44.473 --> 28:47.682
Sir, we were just commenting
on how you'd mellowed.

28:50.187 --> 28:53.100
- Captain?
- What is it, Mahoney?

28:53.273 --> 28:55.640
I hope you're gonna
give this program a fair chance.

28:55.859 --> 29:00.149
This program, Mahoney,
is just like you: a bad idea.

29:00.364 --> 29:01.946
That's your opinion, sir.

29:02.157 --> 29:05.195
But this is Comdt. Lassard's idea,
and his Academy.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.326
Ooh.

29:07.537 --> 29:09.654
Things can change, Mahoney.

29:10.374 --> 29:13.037
Oh, yes, things can change.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.334
I'll see you out front.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.720
I bet that was refreshing, sir.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.141
Over the next two weeks...

29:38.360 --> 29:41.694
...you'll go through
a modified training program.

29:41.905 --> 29:45.398
You'll learn many, many keys
to crime prevention.

29:46.034 --> 29:50.119
Keys you can teach many, many others
in your community.

29:50.330 --> 29:54.244
Modified? Modified nothing.
I want the works.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.166
- Yeah.
- Madam...

29:56.378 --> 29:59.416
...I think it's time for a dose of reality.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.423
You can forget Lassard's hype.

30:03.969 --> 30:07.588
You people do not belong here.

30:08.598 --> 30:11.807
Especially you and you.

30:15.939 --> 30:19.933
Community action groups mean one thing,
and one thing only.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.858
I hope that wasn't gum.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.447
You heard the captain. Is it?

30:31.455 --> 30:35.369
It's definitely gum, sir. Bubble gum.
Cherry, I think.

30:35.792 --> 30:38.626
- Thank you, Proctor.
- You're welcome, sir.

30:41.548 --> 30:45.383
These groups only mean
citizens getting in the way of the police.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.881
Now, I don't get involved
in your business...

30:48.096 --> 30:50.759
...and I don't want you involved in my--

30:54.770 --> 30:56.136
Now, if you were smart...

30:56.355 --> 31:00.190
...you would go home
and forget this stupid idea...

31:02.652 --> 31:04.814
Are those wedding bells I hear, sir?

31:09.493 --> 31:13.612
- Whose damn mutt is this?
- It's my damn mutt.

31:14.956 --> 31:17.539
I want him out of here!

31:17.751 --> 31:19.959
- But, sir--
- Out!

31:20.837 --> 31:22.248
Out!

31:23.298 --> 31:27.292
I am not getting rid of Clarence.
He's my pet.

31:27.511 --> 31:31.175
Why should you?
After all, Harris has Proctor.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.298
I'll take him.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.967
I have a big house, nice yard.

31:36.812 --> 31:39.429
See, he likes me. We'll get along fine.

31:39.648 --> 31:42.732
- Me too? I'm housebroken.
- Heh.

31:42.943 --> 31:45.606
Come on, C.O.Ps,
let's step up to the white line!

31:45.821 --> 31:49.155
Let's line ourselves up with a slot,
then let's listen to Mr. Jones.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.358
Thank you, Sgt. Tackleberry.

31:53.120 --> 31:56.329
This is a standard police issue.38.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.663
Examine this weapon carefully.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.958
You must be sure this weapon is not loaded.

32:01.169 --> 32:05.334
You will be responsible for the loading
and unloading of this weapon yourself.

32:05.715 --> 32:07.752
Now, Sgt. Tackleberry.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.133
You want to become one with the gun.

32:15.225 --> 32:19.060
Feel the gun, caress the gun...

32:20.939 --> 32:24.398
...until it's a living,
breathing, vibrating...

32:24.609 --> 32:27.727
...extension of yourself.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.528
I look for the same in a woman.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.731
This sucker's not loaded.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.862
You won't be using live ammo.

32:34.536 --> 32:38.951
Tack, how about letting me squeeze off
a few rounds of that baby?

32:39.166 --> 32:40.532
Tack?

32:41.543 --> 32:43.284
Affirmative, Mrs. F.

32:45.422 --> 32:48.586
Now, be careful
because a.44 magnum has quite a...

32:51.178 --> 32:52.294
...kick.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.253
Damn, that was fun!

32:58.935 --> 33:01.018
Rescuing the drowning victim.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.846
Now, when approaching
a potentially dangerous...

33:04.024 --> 33:06.357
...and out-of-control victim,
use this stroke only.

33:06.568 --> 33:08.355
Arms out of the way for protection.

33:08.570 --> 33:12.189
Now, when you get the victim in control,
you slip your arm across his chest...

33:12.407 --> 33:13.739
...under his opposite arm.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.363
Rest his head and his neck
against your shoulder.

33:16.578 --> 33:20.117
Kick with your feet.
Now, your victim could be struggling.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.617
Struggle, House. Good, House...

33:23.960 --> 33:24.950
House!

33:34.137 --> 33:36.254
Really swift! I'll get him!

33:41.019 --> 33:44.808
Arnie, get out of the pool! You just ate!

34:01.748 --> 34:03.489
Get him out of here!

34:07.337 --> 34:08.703
Thanks, pal.

34:10.422 --> 34:13.757
Now we have an opportunity
to start our water safety lesson.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.880
I will play the drowning victim.

34:22.601 --> 34:23.888
Arnie?

34:33.862 --> 34:35.900
Now, who's going to save me?

34:36.116 --> 34:37.777
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

35:08.815 --> 35:12.308
That was, uh, mighty brave.
I admire that.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.313
That was nothing.

35:15.155 --> 35:18.865
You don't have a hair dryer,
or, ah! Perhaps some mousse?

35:19.451 --> 35:23.286
No. Your hair looks nice. It's very stylish.

35:23.747 --> 35:25.704
<i>Moi?</i> Stylish?

35:27.834 --> 35:29.416
Oh, um, I think I'd better be going.

35:30.003 --> 35:31.414
Mickey!

35:33.298 --> 35:35.540
He's dead! He killed him!

35:36.134 --> 35:39.844
- Oh, I'm sure the Academy will pay for it.
- What about the sentimental value?

35:40.055 --> 35:41.921
This is a family heirloom here.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.554
This is the last thing I ever stole
before joining the Academy.

35:45.769 --> 35:49.513
What the hell is this? Cadets in heat?

35:49.731 --> 35:51.347
No. We were just, like, talking.

35:51.566 --> 35:54.274
Oh, just, like, talk somewhere else.

35:54.611 --> 35:57.649
This is not a spawning pool.
I want discipline.

35:58.031 --> 36:00.148
Do I make myself clear, Zed?

36:00.742 --> 36:02.108
Discipline!

36:03.620 --> 36:05.361
- Jerk.
- What?

36:05.580 --> 36:06.946
He said bye.

36:10.251 --> 36:13.540
No. I said jerk. I think it was pretty clear.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.417
- I said, "Jerk."
- Jerk.

36:16.841 --> 36:20.460
<i>"Wait," said the daisy, sweet buttercup</i>

36:20.887 --> 36:23.049
<i>Time to get up</i>

36:24.933 --> 36:26.970
<i>Time to get up</i>

36:28.687 --> 36:32.271
<i>As a daisy, sweet buttercup</i>

36:32.607 --> 36:36.476
<i>Time to get up, time to get up</i>

36:52.836 --> 36:54.828
Cadets, I'd now like to discuss with you...

36:55.004 --> 36:57.337
...something that will be
vital for you to know...

36:57.507 --> 37:01.046
...when you're, like, out there on the job
as a police officer.

37:01.261 --> 37:04.174
And that's the correct way
to eat a doughnut.

37:04.848 --> 37:07.135
- A doughnut--
- Attention!

37:09.060 --> 37:10.551
Captain Harris.

37:19.154 --> 37:23.194
From this moment on, anyone
who misplaces their canister of Mace...

37:23.408 --> 37:25.445
...will be reprimanded and fined.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.902
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

37:36.963 --> 37:38.044
Bye.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.171
As Citizens On Patrol...

37:43.386 --> 37:46.925
...endurance and longevity
should be very important to you.

37:47.599 --> 37:51.138
Aerobic activity will keep you in shape...

37:51.978 --> 37:53.810
...and keep that heart rate up.

37:54.314 --> 37:57.227
Music, however,
makes it a little less painful.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.726
Hooks, cassette.

37:59.944 --> 38:03.233
I have confidence that Sgt. Hooks
has chosen the appropriate music.

38:03.448 --> 38:04.859
Oh-ho, no cassette.

38:05.074 --> 38:06.235
Let's go.

38:10.747 --> 38:13.205
Nice selection, Hooks. All right.

38:13.416 --> 38:14.873
Slow walk. Slow start.

38:17.337 --> 38:19.795
Keep your arms moving. That's good.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.419
Into a nice slow jog. Okay!

38:23.092 --> 38:26.335
Arms moving. Keep breathing.
Don't forget to breathe.

38:26.554 --> 38:30.264
Tuck his tummy, Hooks. Attagirl. Let's go.

38:45.114 --> 38:48.528
Now, this whistle can be very valuable...

38:48.743 --> 38:51.201
...when walking through
a bad neighborhood.

38:51.412 --> 38:54.120
If your purse gets snatched,
blow this whistle...

38:54.582 --> 38:57.791
...to alert your neighbors and the police
so they can help.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.619
Now, Mrs. Feldman,
would you play the victim?

39:00.839 --> 39:04.924
- Yes.
- Okay, and I'll be Mr. Purse Snatcher.

39:05.134 --> 39:07.922
- Okay.
- Heh, go.

39:22.569 --> 39:24.060
Any questions?

39:45.925 --> 39:48.133
Now, practice.

40:00.356 --> 40:04.191
You had him for, like, a minute.
He was scared. He was, like, flinching.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.938
His face went:

40:37.727 --> 40:38.888
Sorry.

40:40.521 --> 40:43.980
- Citizens On Patrol. What a joke.
- Heh.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.768
- You know what C.O.P. really stands for?
- Uh, no, sir. What?

40:47.987 --> 40:51.151
- Collection Of Pissants. That's not funny.
- Ha-ha. No, sir.

40:51.366 --> 40:55.701
This citizen-action crap is a disaster,
a bad idea, and I'm going to prove it.

40:55.912 --> 40:57.119
Yes, sir.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.830
Excuse me, everyone.

41:04.045 --> 41:05.206
I mean, not everyone.

41:05.421 --> 41:08.880
Attention! Excuse me. Move it!

41:09.467 --> 41:12.710
- Everybody, come over here!
- Hooks.

41:12.929 --> 41:17.219
Stop embarrassing the Police Department
and join your civilian buddies.

41:17.433 --> 41:20.597
May I have your attention, please?
Hooks, the tank!

41:20.812 --> 41:21.848
Ouch.

41:22.063 --> 41:24.897
- I'm so sorry.
- You dimwit!

41:29.946 --> 41:32.484
Today, Hooks, today.

41:39.330 --> 41:43.324
Now, take your little munchkin voice
and go away.

41:44.961 --> 41:46.042
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

41:47.880 --> 41:49.212
Listen up!

41:49.632 --> 41:54.218
This is the proper procedure
for administering oxygen.

41:55.263 --> 41:59.223
You place the mask securely
about the face of the patient...

41:59.434 --> 42:01.847
...and then have them breathe deeply.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.641
Now, that is the way it's done...

42:08.818 --> 42:10.025
...in Capt. Harris' precinct.

42:11.612 --> 42:14.229
What the hell? Hooks!

42:21.164 --> 42:24.077
So you gentlemen think
you're on a vacation?

42:24.500 --> 42:27.709
You're no better than anyone else,
so let's go, let's get to work.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.877
Come on, dudes, chill out.

42:30.673 --> 42:33.882
You dudes are setting a bad example.

42:34.552 --> 42:38.262
Can't hear you, bro. Can't you see
I'm getting my beauty sleep?

42:38.473 --> 42:39.759
Oh, I'm sorry.

42:40.516 --> 42:41.723
Move it!

42:45.813 --> 42:47.520
You sure told them.

42:49.317 --> 42:52.230
Did you ever think about
maybe getting some contact lenses...

42:52.445 --> 42:54.562
...or something, like, you know?

42:55.656 --> 42:57.192
You'd look good in them.

42:59.535 --> 43:01.492
Proctor, this is an alley.

43:01.662 --> 43:04.325
I know, sir, but these are the directions
Mahoney gave me.

43:04.499 --> 43:05.489
- Mahoney?
- Yes, sir.

43:05.708 --> 43:08.200
He says this restaurant
has the best salad bar in town.

43:08.377 --> 43:10.209
It damn sure better have.

43:23.059 --> 43:25.301
- Proctor.
- Yes, sir?

43:26.187 --> 43:28.645
I don't see a salad bar.

43:29.565 --> 43:32.478
Look, maybe they serve seafood, heh.

43:32.693 --> 43:34.810
That's not funny, you idiot.

43:37.532 --> 43:40.195
What are you looking at, you peckerhead?

43:40.409 --> 43:43.777
Nice uniform.
Makes me wish I'd worn my sailor outfit.

43:45.581 --> 43:49.120
I'm getting out of here. Move it!

43:53.005 --> 43:54.746
Proctor!

43:55.633 --> 43:58.421
I don't think cutting in is allowed, sir.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.047
Nice collar.

44:14.193 --> 44:17.152
Here we go again. Next round.
Mahoney weaving his way through...

44:17.321 --> 44:19.438
...looking pretty good.
Gets past the main defense.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.068
And, under the leg!

44:21.242 --> 44:22.323
Oh.

44:22.535 --> 44:23.867
Nice shot!

44:24.078 --> 44:26.570
That man is a hot dog.
The crowd's gone wild!

44:27.415 --> 44:31.034
The ball's brought in.
Here we go. We have the play going.

44:31.335 --> 44:32.826
Throws to Zed.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.583
- Ahh!
- A little bit of a steal there.

44:36.299 --> 44:37.540
Hightower!

44:37.717 --> 44:40.881
Mahoney throws a pass to Hightower.

44:41.095 --> 44:44.679
And then Hightower he...
The Doctor of Dunk scores!

44:46.434 --> 44:49.268
You killed it. Really swift!

44:50.354 --> 44:51.390
Aha.

44:51.606 --> 44:52.972
Uh, some community action.

44:53.608 --> 44:57.227
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's Lt. Proctor, a ghetto favorite!

44:59.405 --> 45:01.021
Thank you very much.

45:03.034 --> 45:04.491
I'm honored to be--

45:08.998 --> 45:12.491
You know, uh,
Capt. Harris isn't gonna like this...

45:13.336 --> 45:14.793
...goofing off.

45:15.004 --> 45:18.543
- Oh, come on. This is community relations.
- No, Mahoney.

45:18.758 --> 45:22.172
I'm an expert in goofing off,
and this is goofing off.

45:23.346 --> 45:25.633
And I'm gonna have to tell him, heh.

45:26.307 --> 45:29.596
- I have an urge to break him in half.
- Why fight it?

45:30.686 --> 45:34.396
No, Hightower. Take it easy, big guy.
The creep's not worth it.

45:43.699 --> 45:45.565
- You through in there?
- Sure, go ahead.

45:45.785 --> 45:46.901
Thanks.

46:00.383 --> 46:01.624
Excuse me, uh, Silvio?

46:01.842 --> 46:04.926
I wonder if you can help me.
I need some help over here.

46:05.137 --> 46:07.049
- Right there.
<i>- No problem.</i>

46:34.458 --> 46:38.042
Hey, hey, hold your horses,
I'll be out in a minute!

46:39.463 --> 46:41.921
Okay, like, bring it in.

46:42.091 --> 46:45.050
Just, like, bring it in a hair.

46:46.220 --> 46:48.212
Watch out for the plane!

46:48.431 --> 46:50.468
Oh, the humanity, phew!

46:50.683 --> 46:53.767
Okay, that's perfect. No, that's fine.

46:54.937 --> 46:57.350
- Metro police.
- Special assignment.

47:41.150 --> 47:43.016
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

47:43.361 --> 47:45.899
<i>...please rise for our national anthem.</i>

48:01.712 --> 48:05.501
- Aah! Read that part about me again, Arnie.
- What part?

48:05.800 --> 48:08.417
You know, the part about
the dynamic leader of the C.O.P.

48:08.636 --> 48:11.174
Get real! That's me they're talking about.

48:15.601 --> 48:17.513
Good evening, gentlemen.

48:17.686 --> 48:19.348
I congratulate you on another good day.

48:19.522 --> 48:22.265
Sleep well, ha, ha.

48:22.483 --> 48:25.271
Hey, Count, getting worried
we're gonna be taking over soon?

48:25.486 --> 48:26.727
We're ready.

48:26.946 --> 48:30.485
Hm, you're improving, guys. But you're still
way down in the food chain.

48:30.699 --> 48:33.692
As we vampires say, "Lights out, suckers."

48:38.499 --> 48:40.411
This C.O.P. bit is a breeze.

48:40.626 --> 48:42.618
- We are ready.
- I concur.

48:42.837 --> 48:45.375
I think we're ready to bust
some truly major criminals.

48:45.589 --> 48:48.127
Maybe we should go out and find some.

48:48.592 --> 48:53.508
Maybe we should become vigilantes.
Yeah, that's it. Vigilantes.

49:05.234 --> 49:07.897
Wake up, men! We need you. Now!

49:08.320 --> 49:10.903
Come on.

49:11.740 --> 49:15.359
What's going on? Where are we going?
Why are we here? What's happening?

49:15.578 --> 49:18.491
You're here because you're ready.
You said you were ready.

49:18.706 --> 49:20.948
- One thing I--
- You're ready, now.

49:33.220 --> 49:36.338
Could you be a little more specific
concerning our current mission?

49:36.557 --> 49:40.346
- We're apprehending two known felons.
- Uh, I'll be going home now.

50:05.085 --> 50:07.042
- Where are the rest?
- What rest? We're it.

50:07.254 --> 50:11.123
- We'll flush them out of the building.
- You stay behind, cut them off in the alley.

50:11.342 --> 50:12.378
Stay.

50:12.968 --> 50:15.210
What about guns and shit, man?

50:15.429 --> 50:17.842
Guns? No, you won't be needing them.

50:18.057 --> 50:20.549
We're pretty sure they're not armed.

50:49.463 --> 50:53.082
They can handle this without us.
We'll just get in the way, you know.

50:53.300 --> 50:54.381
Good thinking.

50:56.220 --> 50:59.213
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

51:08.190 --> 51:09.852
We got them, men!

51:18.033 --> 51:20.491
It's all right, men. Come on over.

51:23.872 --> 51:27.707
All right, you three
will be riding in the back with Badula...

51:29.420 --> 51:31.207
...and his late brother.

51:37.428 --> 51:39.465
You guys keep him subdued.

51:45.185 --> 51:46.426
Let's go.

52:11.295 --> 52:13.833
Don't let his voodoo mumbo jumbo scare you.

52:23.432 --> 52:28.143
Fools. To think
they can kill the brother of Badula.

52:28.354 --> 52:30.095
I never thought that.

52:31.398 --> 52:35.893
Whoo. That I could reach into the belly
of a yak and rip out his heart.

52:36.487 --> 52:38.979
That would bring him back to life?

52:39.198 --> 52:41.440
No, man. I'm hungry.

52:46.580 --> 52:50.199
Listen, we're going for some burgers
and fries. We'll be right back.

53:30.374 --> 53:31.865
Out of my way!

53:39.925 --> 53:43.418
I guess they weren't as ready
as they thought they were.

53:43.637 --> 53:46.129
- You can take the mask off now, Tack.
- Heh.

53:57.401 --> 53:58.937
- Proctor.
- Yes, sir?

53:59.153 --> 54:02.863
- Who are all these people?
- Oh, they're here for the party, sir.

54:03.365 --> 54:04.697
What party?

54:05.367 --> 54:09.202
A few of the Citizens On Patrol members
invited a few of their friends...

54:09.413 --> 54:12.997
...and they invited a few of their friends.
You know how it goes, sir.

54:13.208 --> 54:14.870
- A party?
- Yes, sir.

54:15.461 --> 54:18.875
A party? Why wasn't I told?

54:21.383 --> 54:23.466
- Mahoney.
- Hey, Callahan.

54:24.595 --> 54:26.006
Here you go.

54:27.222 --> 54:28.804
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!

54:29.016 --> 54:31.929
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I please have your attention?

54:32.144 --> 54:34.352
I'd like to thank you all for coming!

54:34.813 --> 54:36.224
Let's party!

54:46.241 --> 54:48.153
- Move those patooties.
- Excuse me.

54:48.368 --> 54:50.985
All police officers out of the pool!

54:51.163 --> 54:54.076
- Proctor!
- Let's go! Out, everybody out!

54:54.291 --> 54:57.250
Sir, why don't you just
let everyone enjoy themselves?

54:57.461 --> 55:00.829
Why don't you just
kiss my rosy red ass, Mahoney?

55:02.883 --> 55:04.215
Rosy?

55:04.426 --> 55:06.713
Get out of that pool now!

55:09.389 --> 55:11.551
Just look at yourself.

55:13.143 --> 55:19.265
You are a disgrace to the uniform!
Go get changed. Move it, move it, move it.

55:27.699 --> 55:31.739
- What are we looking for?
- This.

55:35.123 --> 55:37.331
- Why, Capt. Harris.
- Miss Mattson.

55:37.543 --> 55:38.954
- Hello, heh.
- How are you?

55:39.169 --> 55:40.535
Have you seen Clarence?

55:42.047 --> 55:44.289
Don't you let that fleabag near me.

55:44.508 --> 55:47.467
Clarence is crazy about you, Captain.

55:47.636 --> 55:49.047
Let me just call him over.

55:49.263 --> 55:50.595
- No.
- For a second?

55:50.806 --> 55:53.469
- No.
- Okay. Bye.

55:59.815 --> 56:04.310
Wipe those grins off your faces,
buttbreaths! Dismissed!

56:09.491 --> 56:10.698
Hmm.

56:12.995 --> 56:15.658
<i>Dr. Berman, please pick up line two.</i>

56:15.831 --> 56:17.242
<i>Dr. Berman, line two, please.</i>

56:17.875 --> 56:20.242
- You shouldn't be in here.
- How is Capt. Harris?

56:20.460 --> 56:23.999
- We'll do all we can.
- Please, be gentle.

56:41.231 --> 56:43.974
Um, I heard what Harris said,
and he's wrong.

56:44.693 --> 56:46.810
It happens to me all the time.

56:46.987 --> 56:48.694
People just don't understand me.

56:50.365 --> 56:53.608
Maybe if you talked a little slower,
a little softer...

56:53.827 --> 56:57.912
That's not what I meant. I meant
people don't know who I really am.

56:58.790 --> 57:01.578
Now I got to worry about my diction too?

57:02.377 --> 57:05.040
- How's my sentence structure?
- Perfect.

57:07.799 --> 57:10.712
In fact, I think you're just about perfect.

58:24.251 --> 58:26.459
I think I'm going to puke.

58:33.260 --> 58:35.798
Hi, sir. How are you feeling?

58:36.680 --> 58:39.263
I have to wait
for the damn glue to wear off.

58:41.393 --> 58:42.975
I didn't catch that.

58:43.186 --> 58:45.803
Was that, "the dim shoe to snare off"?

58:46.314 --> 58:51.184
I said I have to wait
for the damn glue to wear off.

58:57.325 --> 59:01.990
So I asked her,
"Do you always work under podiums?"

59:09.671 --> 59:11.037
Commandant?

59:11.923 --> 59:16.463
Why, Chief Hurst,
this is a splendid, splendid surprise!

59:16.678 --> 59:20.297
You remember Nogata?
He's part of our Japanese contingent.

59:20.515 --> 59:22.222
This is Chief Hurst.

59:22.642 --> 59:27.137
We have heard many, many
wonderful things about you and your city.

59:28.815 --> 59:31.182
I've been helping them
with their English, heh.

59:31.401 --> 59:33.688
- Please, sit. Please.
- Thank you.

59:35.447 --> 59:40.067
I hope you'll find the time
to, uh, see our beautiful city firsthand.

59:40.869 --> 59:43.907
In fact, I've just flown here personally...

59:44.122 --> 59:46.330
...to extend the mayor's invitation...

59:46.750 --> 59:48.207
...to see my...

59:48.877 --> 59:53.622
To see Comdt. Lassard's
community program in action.

59:54.049 --> 59:56.962
We are convinced
that this program will serve...

59:57.177 --> 01:00:00.511
...as a model for cities around the world.

01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:08.811
We would be honored
to accept your invitation.

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:11.389
- Wonderful.
- Oh, please, come.

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:17.019
<i>- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Arrivederci.</i>

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:21.066
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:27.997
I see you've been teaching them
something other than English.

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:29.665
Heh, I do what I can.

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:33.290
- So my program is really, really working?
- Hell, yes.

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:38.838
Starting tomorrow,
C.O.Ps will be working the streets.

01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:57.394
C.O.P. emergency. Feldman here.

01:00:57.571 --> 01:01:00.530
Meet me at the corner of
Clark and Main Street at the warehouse.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.777
<i>10-4, Mrs. F.</i>

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.754
- $40, we're agreed?
- Okay, $40.

01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:20.550
Snap off a few shots for evidence.

01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:23.923
Get closer.

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:31.473
I saw this on <i>Hill Street Blues.</i>
It's a fencing operation.

01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:34.931
You're gonna love these.
We just unloaded a van full of them.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:36.607
Okay, bring in the rest of it.

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:38.104
Next case.

01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:47.531
Nice camera.
Don't let that crook give you less than $80.

01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:55.164
Freeze, you scuzzbuckets!

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:58.337
This is a citizen's arrest. Get them, boys!

01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:15.100
You're not moving till the cops get here.

01:02:16.942 --> 01:02:18.649
I am the cops, lady.

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:24.322
Three months' work
out the window, down the drain.

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:27.613
Your Citizens On Patrol just screwed up...

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:31.787
...the single biggest
undercover police sting operation...

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:34.615
...in the history of this city!

01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:38.627
Tell them the good news, sir.

01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:41.380
- Thank you, Proctor.
- You're welcome, sir.

01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:47.003
As of now,
the C.O.P. program is suspended...

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:49.885
...pending a full investigation.

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:56.767
Ten-hut!

01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:11.744
Mahoney, I'm so, so proud
of the job you've done.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.491
Nice work, men.

01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:16.620
The eyes of the world are on this program.

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:20.044
Excuse me, sir. I think we should talk.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.384
This precinct must deal with
every type of criminal...

01:03:26.594 --> 01:03:30.087
from pickpockets to armed robbers,
felons of all kinds--

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:34.347
Capt. Harris. Excuse me.
Um, don't forget the gang of ninjas.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:40.056
They're my personal favorites.

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:43.942
Why don't you go pay them a visit?

01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:51.617
This precinct
is run on discipline and organization.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:54.946
Simon says, "Pull your left ear."

01:03:56.458 --> 01:04:00.577
Simon says, "Hop on your left foot."
Come on, guys.

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:06.253
Simon says, "Hop on your right foot."

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:09.422
It's a little too noisy in here, gentlemen.

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:11.713
We have important
police officials visiting...

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:14.389
...and I think you'd better show
the proper respect.

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.516
Ah, come on, Lieutenant.
We're almost finished.

01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:19.721
Come on, lieutenant,
join us in a friendly game of Simon Says.

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:24.559
There's nothing to it.
Now, Simon says, "Touch your toes."

01:04:24.986 --> 01:04:29.026
Come on, lieutenant.
Simon says, "Clap your hands."

01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:32.699
Come on, get in the spirit.

01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:37.284
Simon says, "Two steps right."

01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:42.376
Simon says, "Five steps back."

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:47.748
Put your hands up!

01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:50.259
Ha, ha, Simon didn't say.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:52.632
No, but Smith & Wesson does.

01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:57.216
The high-security cell area
is used to hold criminals...

01:04:57.435 --> 01:05:01.349
...awaiting trial or transfer
to state or county facilities.

01:05:01.856 --> 01:05:04.098
Any convictions involving felons...

01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:09.236
...uh, perverts, thieves,
people of that nature, are held in this area.

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:14.196
- You will notice the steel construction.
- What the hell is he doing in there?

01:05:17.956 --> 01:05:20.198
I think that explains it, sir.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.542
Come on, hurry up!

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.022
<i>It's getting to the point now</i>

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:50.561
<i>When I'm with you</i>

01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:53.856
<i>I no longer want to have
Something stuck in my eye</i>

01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:58.035
<i>Your mother, my mother
Ain't never looked like Florence Henderson</i>

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.617
Heh, I wrote that for you.

01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:08.253
Oh, Zed.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.503
I hope now that C.O.P. is over...

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:14.506
...it won't mean that we won't
be seeing each other anymore.

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:15.711
- Shut up!
- Aah!

01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:18.256
Not you. I meant the ducks.

01:06:18.558 --> 01:06:20.345
Attention. This is Mrs. F.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.554
<i>- There's been a jailbreak.</i>
- Zed, 10-4! Ha, ha!

01:06:24.772 --> 01:06:27.480
Tack, you pick me up at Main and Maple.

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:29.938
Move it! Over and out.

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:32.395
Commandant!

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:36.403
Commandant! Commandant!

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:41.119
- There's been a jailbreak, sir.
- Get in.

01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:54.967
- It is so wonderful to see you again, baby.
- It's wonderful to be seen.

01:06:55.303 --> 01:06:59.968
- Just like old times.
- In America, talk is cheap.

01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:07.638
- There's been a jailbreak!
- Oh.

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:15.775
Look, there's a stolen police car.
That's got to be it.

01:07:16.157 --> 01:07:18.740
I think we got a robbery in progress.

01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:32.754
Stay here, Mrs. Feldman.

01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:42.343
Freeze!

01:07:42.934 --> 01:07:44.766
Good idea.

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:54.356
All right, I want everybody
to get back in that vault.

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:57.609
Yahoo!

01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:04.370
Book them, Tack, heh.

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:12.210
- There's a ninja now.
- I see him.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:14.872
Come on, let's get him. Let's go.

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:34.728
Do you see him?

01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:42.899
Oh, shit.

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:51.412
All right. If it's a fight you want,
a fight you'll get.

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:22.527
Damn you. You're gonna pay for that.

01:09:37.715 --> 01:09:39.832
Ha! Uh-oh.

01:09:55.817 --> 01:09:56.853
Yo!

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:10.617
<i>Nobody knows my sorrow</i>

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:13.657
Shut up!

01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:16.660
Will you two morons knock it off!

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:19.667
We've got an international incident
going on here!

01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:25.635
- I knew you'd come.
<i>- Ja, danke.</i>

01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:29.181
- You may thank Mrs. Feldman.
- Who is Mrs. Feldman?

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:32.760
You know Mrs. Feldman,
a member of the defunct C.O.P. team.

01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:42.357
This is Sgt. Mahoney
in pursuit of a stolen police car.

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:44.692
<i>I'm headed towards
the Williams County air show.</i>

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:49.072
<i>Repeat, I'm pursing four escapees
toward the Williams County air show.</i>

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:52.117
<i>Now, folks,</i>
making his second appearance...

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:55.328
<i>...at the Williams County air show...</i>

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.956
Hey, hey, hey!

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:01.163
Whoa!

01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:07.799
- Look out for that car!
- What car?

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:11.386
That car! Come on, get out!

01:11:13.227 --> 01:11:14.559
Come on!

01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:17.638
Let's get out of here!

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:20.936
Hurry up!

01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:13.986
This is where I draw the line.
I'm not going up in one of those things.

01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:17.198
- No way. No, sirree.
- You don't have to.

01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:40.186
Hey!

01:12:40.815 --> 01:12:42.852
You can open your eyes now.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:45.976
How can you like this
better than my driving?

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:49.484
Because you can't do this in a car.

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:09.549
Grab that balloon!

01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:12.756
We commandeer this balloon
in the name of the law!

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:16.682
- No, wait, you can't!
- You can't do that. We need it for the race.

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:32.190
Mrs. Feldman, stay with the car.
Zed, Sweetchuck, follow me.

01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:37.911
Guys, wait up! Tackleberry.

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:40.493
- What do I pull?
- Take it up!

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:44.122
- They're getting away! Let's go!
- We are going up, sir.

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:54.211
Come on! Drop the parachute!

01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:56.721
Stop screwing around!

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.684
- Come on! Drop the parachute!
- Come on!

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:03.512
If he doesn't want to do it, don't push him.

01:14:03.731 --> 01:14:06.018
He's gotta, like, wanna help himself.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.573
You land that balloon right now!

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:19.157
This is Capt. Harris! You are under arrest!

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:22.115
Land that balloon now!

01:14:24.585 --> 01:14:28.249
- I'll just blast them out of the sky, sir.
- No! Not yet.

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:32.257
You're right.
I should give them a warning shot first.

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:40.594
Imbecile! Are you happy now?

01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:43.677
At least it looks like
we're coming down in the river.

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:47.389
It won't matter
because you're going to be dead!

01:14:47.608 --> 01:14:48.769
Pretty view--

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:55.989
I hate water!

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:01.820
Help!

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.656
Help!

01:15:05.793 --> 01:15:09.286
- They're in the river.
- Hurry. Maybe we can catch them.

01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:15.633
I'll pull alongside Tackleberry.

01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:23.258
Look, I see my house!

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:25.515
Look, the crooks!

01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:29.765
- Whoa!
- Let's go get them, okay?

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:44.662
Hang on, sir!

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:52.209
- Hurry, before they go over the falls!
- There they go!

01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:56.875
Get a rope!

01:15:58.012 --> 01:15:59.878
Hang on. Hang on, sir!

01:16:02.516 --> 01:16:04.849
Hang on, we'll come and get you!

01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:13.517
Grab it!

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:36.214
Try to relax!

01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:51.938
There's the balloon! Now I've got them.

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:07.825
There's only one way to do this
and it's up to me!

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:12.960
- Take over!
- He was talking to you!

01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:16.455
If you're coming back, bring some beer!

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:24.713
Oomph!

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:28.558
- No. He was talking to you.
- No, I heard him.

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:33.184
- He said, "Sweetchuck, take over."
- No, he did not.

01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:39.652
- Get off of my foot!
- Shut up! Why are you always whining?

01:17:39.864 --> 01:17:41.696
Leave me alone!

01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:15.856
Gentlemen, may I see your license
and registration, please?

01:18:16.817 --> 01:18:21.687
There they are. Take it down.
I want to get close. Get closer.

01:18:26.076 --> 01:18:29.194
Mahoney, what are you doing?

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:31.154
Get in closer!

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:46.548
What do you think you're doing?

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:53.435
I'll take care of you, copper!

01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:57.184
Get off my wing! Get off of there!

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:59.482
What will you do about them?

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:09.943
Pal, it's over. Let's go home.

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:16.287
- I hate you.
- I'm not really thrilled about you!

01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:20.955
- Why don't you lose some weight?
- Why don't you get out and walk?

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:27.047
- I'm going to be sick!
- I don't have a parachute!

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:31.257
- Shut up! I'm going to be sick!
- Don't be sick on me!

01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:44.857
- I don't have a chute!
- Break your fall!

01:19:45.072 --> 01:19:48.281
- Hit the kids!
- No, I need a chute!

01:19:48.575 --> 01:19:50.362
Get your own! Get away from me!

01:19:50.577 --> 01:19:52.159
Come on!

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:54.366
Let go!

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.407
I'll break you in half, you dweeb.

01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:01.040
There, I opened the chute.
Are you satisfied? Leave me alone!

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:10.550
- I'm going to kill you!
- Shut up and enjoy the flight!

01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:22.102
Get off me!

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:32.067
Commandant, they say
your Citizens On Patrol group...

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:36.371
...does many, many
wonderful and crazy things.

01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:48.838
I think Sgt. Mahoney
deserves a special bow.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:51.002
- Mahoney?
- All right!

01:20:51.889 --> 01:20:53.846
Mahoney?

01:20:54.433 --> 01:20:56.015
Mahoney!

01:21:02.232 --> 01:21:03.348
Mahoney.

01:21:03.817 --> 01:21:05.399
Get up! Look, it's Mahoney!

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.398
- Where?
- Sorry.

01:21:12.326 --> 01:21:14.659
- To the Academy.
- To the Academy.

01:21:21.585 --> 01:21:24.623
You know, you look
a little like Tom Cruise in <i>Top Gun.</i>

01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:26.579
- Yeah?
- No!
