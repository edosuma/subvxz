It just...
It makes me nervous, okay?

09:46.977 --> 09:48.805
I-I don't want anyone
to get hurt.

09:48.849 --> 09:50.633
[scoffs]
Okay, and here I thought

09:50.677 --> 09:53.201
you were finally coming around
on "these people."

09:53.244 --> 09:56.291
Why are you so quick
to believe the worst in them?

09:56.334 --> 09:58.162
I guess you can't take
that cop hat off, can you?

09:58.206 --> 09:59.729
Look, screw you, Jharrel.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.601
You're not gonna paint me
as some kind of monster

10:01.644 --> 10:04.125
for trying to keep the public
safe, for doing my job.

10:04.168 --> 10:06.301
What, finding excuses
to keep people locked up?

10:06.344 --> 10:07.432
Wow.

10:07.476 --> 10:08.608
What a great job.

10:17.878 --> 10:20.445
CLAUDETTE:
My, my, my. This city

10:20.489 --> 10:22.360
sure is something.

10:22.404 --> 10:25.929
Oh, I can't believe
how good this feels.

10:25.973 --> 10:27.670
You want to look up directions
to our next stop?

10:27.714 --> 10:30.151
I know
you didn't just ask me that.

10:30.194 --> 10:32.762
[chuckles]
It's how we get around in 2021.

10:32.806 --> 10:35.286
Well, I barely trust paper maps.
I'm sure as hell not gonna trust

10:35.330 --> 10:36.636
some gadget I don't understand.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.115
All right, fair enough.

10:38.159 --> 10:39.595
[sighs]
I miss driving.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.772
Wind in my hair.
My own little pocket of freedom.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.948
Where were you?

10:44.992 --> 10:47.255
When you were taken?

10:47.298 --> 10:48.691
Does that mean you believe

10:48.735 --> 10:50.432
we were taken
from different places and times?

10:50.475 --> 10:54.392
'Cause shoe on the other foot,
I don't know if I'd believe us.

10:54.436 --> 10:55.916
[chuckles softly]

10:55.959 --> 10:58.309
Well, believing
y'all means...

10:58.353 --> 11:01.095
my missing brother Manny
could still be out there.

11:02.139 --> 11:05.447
You know, it means that I
don't have to give up hope.

11:05.490 --> 11:09.973
'Cause if you can go
from the 1950s to now,

11:10.017 --> 11:11.671
anything's possible.

11:13.150 --> 11:16.850
And, unlike
some of my colleagues,

11:16.893 --> 11:21.071
I believe y'all when you say
that you have nothing to hide.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.507
You know? You're not

11:22.551 --> 11:24.771
some threat to the public.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.729
I just want to give

11:26.773 --> 11:28.078
you all the chance

11:28.122 --> 11:30.559
to show the world
that you can be trusted.

11:35.042 --> 11:36.478
You ready?

11:37.479 --> 11:38.959
Ready for what?

11:39.002 --> 11:41.352
Uh, there is a gas station
up the road.

11:41.396 --> 11:42.789
I'm gonna fill it up,

11:42.832 --> 11:44.181
and you can get
behind the wheel and...

11:44.225 --> 11:45.705
You're gonna let me
drive your car?

11:45.748 --> 11:47.489
Yeah.

11:47.532 --> 11:50.318
I told you, I trust you.

11:54.148 --> 11:56.498
[indistinct chatter]

11:56.541 --> 11:59.631
I can't believe how much
it's changed in 16 years.

12:01.808 --> 12:04.071
Were there canines pushed
in strollers 16 years ago,

12:04.114 --> 12:06.726
or is this a more
recent development?[chuckles]

12:06.769 --> 12:09.032
Oh. Cars.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.818
How do they not crash
into each other at such speeds?

12:11.861 --> 12:13.820
Oh. The lighted beacons.
Do they communicate

12:13.863 --> 12:15.647
with the cars?Wait, Andre.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.258
MAN:
Hey, watch it.

12:20.827 --> 12:23.525
Come on. Got a lot to see.

12:27.572 --> 12:30.401
Really appreciate you taking the
lead on these tech tutorials.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.752
Sure. Happy to help.

12:32.795 --> 12:35.319
Soraya here will get you set up
with everything you need, ma'am.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.278
Mine doesn't have
an "on" button.

12:37.321 --> 12:40.716
Uh, so,
just like we did in class,

12:40.760 --> 12:42.109
you just toggle
your phone a bit,

12:42.152 --> 12:43.763
and then the home
screen will pop up.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.243
[chuckles]: My God.
How does it know how to do that?

12:46.287 --> 12:47.810
LADONNA:
Gyroscope?

12:47.854 --> 12:49.812
Or maybe the light sensor?

12:50.857 --> 12:53.381
Both, actually.WOMAN:
Thank you.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.950
I didn't know you were back.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.083
I'm sorry about the video,

13:00.127 --> 13:01.911
but, you know,
desperate times and all that,

13:01.955 --> 13:03.434
so...
[chuckles]

13:04.392 --> 13:07.177
Speaking of, um,

13:07.221 --> 13:08.700
I need your help.
So, me and Andre

13:08.744 --> 13:10.267
are trying to crack
this COBOL code.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.529
Do you maybe have, like,
a program that we could...

13:11.573 --> 13:13.575
Are you kidding
me right now?

13:15.359 --> 13:17.535
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

13:18.536 --> 13:21.539
I trusted you, and
you betrayed me.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.454
Plus, I've seen enough
of your fake apologies on TV

13:23.498 --> 13:25.195
to know one when I see it.

13:25.239 --> 13:27.589
I'm sorry, fake?
No, I was trying to...I should go.

13:28.808 --> 13:32.681
Before you get us both
into more trouble.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.205
[scoffs]

13:39.557 --> 13:43.126
My husband had
a 1951 Oldsmobile 88.

13:43.170 --> 13:46.782
[chuckles]
Mm, how that machine could run.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.610
Yeah, what did you do
back then?

13:48.653 --> 13:50.046
In Mississippi?

13:50.090 --> 13:53.223
I was an activist.
A photographer.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.530
Organizing sit-ins and
getting the word out.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.837
My husband may have been
the face of the movement,

13:57.880 --> 14:00.709
but my photos
are what made the papers.

14:00.752 --> 14:03.581
You know what? Now the 4,400
are the ones in the papers.[chuckles]

14:03.625 --> 14:06.106
I'd just as well prefer
to stay behind the camera.

14:06.149 --> 14:09.283
Yeah, but you...
You traveled through time.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.154
That's got to be...

14:12.112 --> 14:13.678
It must be wild.

14:13.722 --> 14:16.899
I'm here now. Just trying
to make the most of it.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.945
[phone buzzing]

14:19.946 --> 14:21.904
[sighs]

14:21.948 --> 14:23.601
Yeah?

14:23.645 --> 14:25.865
No, I can't right now.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.084
Because I have a job.

14:29.129 --> 14:31.783
All right, fine. I'll be there.

14:31.827 --> 14:33.524
[sighs]

14:33.568 --> 14:37.006
Hey, I'm sorry. Can you
pull over at the next bend?

14:37.050 --> 14:39.095
I got to take you back
to the hotel.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.923
What? Now?

14:40.967 --> 14:43.186
We aren't due back
until at least 3:00.

14:43.230 --> 14:44.884
I wa... I was hoping we
could grab some lunch out.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.886
That hotel food
is criminal.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.539
Okay, how about this?

14:48.583 --> 14:50.933
We can get lunch, but...

14:50.977 --> 14:53.501
you got to come
with me somewhere first.

14:55.155 --> 14:56.634
Where we going?

14:56.678 --> 14:58.941
[sighs]

14:58.985 --> 15:00.247
[knock on door][door opens]

15:01.291 --> 15:03.598
Hey, Hayden. Can I come in?

15:03.641 --> 15:05.165
Any news on Mildred?

15:05.208 --> 15:07.254
Or Noah?

15:09.560 --> 15:11.214
Isn't it your job
to get them back?

15:11.258 --> 15:13.782
I will make a call
to Ypsi Med myself.

15:13.825 --> 15:15.915
See if I can
get any updates.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.919
But my job is a
parole officer.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.573
I help people who are
newly free stay free

15:22.617 --> 15:26.229
by making sure they're equipped
to deal with the outside world.

15:27.448 --> 15:30.059
I have that same
protectiveness for you.

15:30.103 --> 15:32.496
For all the 4,400.

15:35.195 --> 15:37.762
Which is why I need to make
sure there are no surprises...

15:37.806 --> 15:40.504
before I'm out there
vouching for everyone.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.680
Because I was with Claudette
at Mrs. Grover's,

15:42.724 --> 15:45.596
and I saw something.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.511
But I protected her.

15:47.555 --> 15:49.426
I did my job.

15:49.470 --> 15:52.212
And I can only do
that job if the people

15:52.255 --> 15:54.475
I'm trying to help are
honest with me, so, Hayden,

15:54.518 --> 15:56.694

there's anything

out into the real world,

I need you to tell me.

I don't like to lie.

officials

for release.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.857
But everything's a risk, right?

19:24.032 --> 19:26.208
I guess you have to decide
if not taking the risk

19:26.252 --> 19:28.036
is worth the regret.

about you, the girls--

to take a risk

my family as an excuse.
