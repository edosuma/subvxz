[indistinct chatter]

00:11.512 --> 00:16.384
[cheering]

00:16.417 --> 00:17.518
- Hey!

00:17.551 --> 00:19.420
- That's my uncle Miles
on the grill.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.322
Uncle Miles?
- Is that gingerhead with you?

00:21.355 --> 00:23.257
- [laughing]

00:23.291 --> 00:25.593
Oh, is that
my baby girl Becca?

00:25.626 --> 00:28.129
- Can you believe how
big she's gotten?

00:28.162 --> 00:30.264
- Hey, Grandma.
- Hey, sweetie.

00:30.298 --> 00:32.433
- This is Will.
- Hi, Will.

00:32.466 --> 00:35.536
- Hi.
Nice to meet you.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.438
- Why don't you go
see your uncle Will?

00:37.471 --> 00:38.806
- Okay, hi.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.341
- Stay with Will.
- Hi.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.409
- Okay.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.511
- Denise?

00:43.544 --> 00:44.545
- Hey, Mags.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.114
- I didn't think you
were gonna come.

00:46.147 --> 00:49.583
- Ah...
- Oh...

00:49.617 --> 00:52.086
- Just decided to fly in
at the last minute.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.122
- Well, I'm glad you did.

00:54.155 --> 00:57.158
Will Halstead, come over here
and meet my sister, Denise.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.160
- Okay, let me hand her over.
- I'll take her.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.661
- Yeah, nice to meet you.
- Come on, sweetie.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.830
[grunts]

01:02.863 --> 01:05.132
- Hi, Denise.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.567
So are you to blame
for the big mouth on this one?

01:06.600 --> 01:09.337
- Please, Maggie's been sassy
ever since she could talk.

01:09.370 --> 01:12.573
- It's not my fault;
I was born that way.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.542
So what should we do?

01:14.575 --> 01:17.211
I'm off on Monday and the
weather's supposed to be great.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.447
- I'm actually flying back
to Dallas in a few hours.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.183
I got to be back at the makeup
counter tomorrow.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.584
- Well, let's make
the most of it, then.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.319
- Okay.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.455
- Come on, let's go say
hi to everybody.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.389
Hey!

01:31.625 --> 01:34.195
- Morning, Ms. Goodwin.
- Good morning.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.463
- What brings you in
on a Saturday?

01:35.496 --> 01:37.465
- I could ask you
the same thing.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.200
- I'm filling in
as trauma attending.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.869
We haven't had an elective
heart surgery in a week.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.671
- Yes, I know we've had
some cancellations

01:43.704 --> 01:45.506
since Dr. Downey died,

01:45.539 --> 01:50.444
but we can't expect to rebuild
a destination program overnight.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.246
We've got a great team.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.183
Word will spread.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.484
- Connor! Incoming.

01:56.517 --> 01:57.485
- With you.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.220
- Patient name: Glenn Simon.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.488
57-year-old male.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.590
GSC 15, vitals stable.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.225
Got knocked off his horse
at the polo ground.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.493
Gross deformity
to the right femur.

02:05.526 --> 02:06.460
- All right, let's go to T3.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.262
- Mr. Simon, can you
tell us what happened?

02:08.295 --> 02:09.497
- My buddy Harvey is a cheater.

02:09.530 --> 02:10.364
That's what happened.

02:10.398 --> 02:12.300
Tried to pull
a 90-degree ride-off.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.168
Knocked me clear off my pony.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.370
- All right, let's get an X-ray
and call Ortho.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.306
- Got it.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.241
- All right, let's move him
on my count.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.575
Ready?

02:21.609 --> 02:24.312
One, two, three.
- [moans]

02:28.416 --> 02:30.384
- Mr. Simon, any pain?
- Not there.

02:30.418 --> 02:31.552
- Okay.
- Ugh!

02:31.585 --> 02:33.187
Oh, ho, ho.
- Looks like we found it.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.955
- Yep.
- Let's get him off the board.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.691
All right, on my count:
one, two, three.

02:37.725 --> 02:40.228
- [moaning]
- Gently. There we go.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.229
- Nice.
- [laughs nervously]

02:41.262 --> 02:42.530
- Get an IV started.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.764
Hang a bolus of saline.

02:43.797 --> 02:46.234
Five milligrams of morphine
for the pain.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.535
- We're gonna get you fixed up,
Mr. Simon.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.437
- I never like to admit
that my wife was right,

02:49.470 --> 02:52.373
but I'd be in a lot less pain
if I stuck to golf like...

02:52.406 --> 02:54.375
[slurring]
she asked me to...

02:54.408 --> 02:56.477
- Mr. Simon?
Mr. Simon, can you hear me?

02:56.510 --> 02:58.512
He's stroking.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.350
All right, give 20 milligrams
of labetalol.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.318
Let's get him to CT
and echo now.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.757
- Maybe I'll come and visit
in Dallas.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.692
I can use some primping.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.794
- You know, I actually might
be out of town a bit

03:13.827 --> 03:15.263
over the next two months.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.365
But after that, yeah.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.366
Bye.

03:18.399 --> 03:19.433
- Bye.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.242
- So, uh, how long's she
been living in Dallas?

03:28.276 --> 03:29.109
- I don't know.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.578
She moved maybe nine,
ten years ago.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.281
- Let me guess--
because of a guy?

03:33.314 --> 03:34.582
- Something like that.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.818
[tires screeching, crash]

03:37.851 --> 03:40.721
Denise!

03:40.754 --> 03:42.356
- Whoa, easy, Denise.

03:42.390 --> 03:43.724
- Denise? Okay.
- You're okay.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.293
- I'm right here.
I'm right here.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.394
Are you okay?
- I can't see.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.296
- Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.830
Okay, breathe. Breathe.
- I can't see.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.717

04:09.750 --> 04:11.419
- What? Nothing.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.754
- Okay, something's different.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.756
You look happy.
- [chuckles]

04:15.789 --> 04:18.426
I'm just glad to have
a weekend shift.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.694
Looking forward
to a quiet day.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.330
- Hey, Nat.
- Yeah?

04:22.363 --> 04:23.331
- Will has the day off.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.665
Thought Jeff could follow you.

04:24.698 --> 04:25.866
- Sure.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.402
Okay.

04:34.742 --> 04:35.743
[radio chatter]

04:35.776 --> 04:37.678
- What've we got?
- Mid-20s male.

04:37.711 --> 04:38.879
Found him down by
the train station.

04:38.912 --> 04:39.980
GCS 14.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.416
Fever's 103.
BP's 160 over 90.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.651
Heart rate 110.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.885
- Sir, can you tell us
what happened?

04:44.918 --> 04:46.019
- I don't think you'll
get very far.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.388
He doesn't speak
a word of English.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.323
No ID--this is everything
we found on him.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.359
- [speaking foreign language]

04:51.392 --> 04:53.794
- It's a foreign currency.
- Let me see that.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.663
Yeah, it's Thai.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.730
- If he just arrived
to the U.S.,

04:56.764 --> 04:58.666
he could have brought
whatever this is with him.

04:58.699 --> 04:59.833
Let's track down
a translator online.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.669
- Right.
Let's get him to T2.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.375
- Mr. Simon, we're taking you up
to the surgical ICU.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.042
You understand?

05:09.076 --> 05:10.911
- Glenn, honey.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.846
I'm here.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.881
Glenn?

05:13.914 --> 05:14.915
Glenn!

05:14.948 --> 05:17.385
- Mrs. Simon?

05:17.418 --> 05:19.753
- Why isn't my husband
saying anything?

05:19.787 --> 05:21.054
- Mrs. Simon,
I'm Dr. Rhodes.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.990
I'm taking care
of your husband.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.693
Why don't we find somewhere
where we can talk?

05:27.861 --> 05:30.731
So your husband has what is
called a bifurcated vena cava.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.434
It allowed the emboli
from his leg fracture

05:33.467 --> 05:37.405
to bypass his lungs and go
straight into his brain.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.940
With your consent,
I would like to operate.

05:39.973 --> 05:43.377
- I'd like to get
a second opinion.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.946
Glenn has a partner who's on
the board at the Mayo Clinic,

05:45.979 --> 05:49.417
and I'm sure he could refer us
to a cardiologist there.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.818
- I understand.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.420
As long as he has the fracture,

05:52.453 --> 05:54.822
he's at risk of having
another stroke.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.425
And we can't fix his leg
until I fix his heart.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.760
Waiting could put him
in even greater danger.

06:02.530 --> 06:05.799
- Fool still thinks
he's 25 years old.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.035
I came here to give him
a piece of my mind,

06:08.068 --> 06:10.704
and now this.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.440
- Mrs. Simon.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.843
We have a great team
here at Gaffney.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.546
I believe when your husband
comes out of surgery,

06:18.579 --> 06:21.482
he's gonna be good and ready
to receive a piece of your mind.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.153
- Okay.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.860
- Will, uh--
Dr. Halstead--

06:32.893 --> 06:35.429
gave her a dose of IV steroids.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.030
Now her vision is starting
to return.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.567
- Any idea what may
have caused this?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.769
- Not yet.
- Can we get you anything?

06:41.802 --> 06:43.571
- No, you both got
enough on your plate.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.006
And I'm fine--really.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.882
- Denise, I would really
encourage you to stay.

06:54.915 --> 06:55.949
- [stammering]
I'm okay.

06:55.983 --> 06:56.950
[chuckles]

06:56.984 --> 06:57.985
- Where you going?

06:58.018 --> 06:59.887
- If I leave now,
I can still catch my flight.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.154
- But a second ago,
you couldn't see your hand

07:01.188 --> 07:02.189
in front of your face.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.157
- Yeah, and now I can.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.493
Thanks for the great care.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.860
- Don't be stubborn, Denise.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.161
- You know I've always
had migraines.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.930
This is just another
passing episode.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.932
- Transient blindness can
actually be caused

07:11.965 --> 07:12.866
by a number of things.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.469
We should run some more tests.
- Exactly.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.037
What happens next time
that you have

07:17.070 --> 07:18.171
one of your passing episodes,

07:18.205 --> 07:20.774
and you're driving
on the expressway?

07:20.808 --> 07:22.876
- Fine. Fine.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.211
Can we make this quick?

07:28.816 --> 07:30.851
- Ah--this is what I get
for trying to take on

07:30.884 --> 07:32.486
a 12-pound pot roast.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.854
- [laughs]

07:33.887 --> 07:35.923
Good news is, it's just
a second-degree burn.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.190
Might blister and swell a bit,

07:37.224 --> 07:38.526
but you'll live to cook
another day.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.028
- Okay, BP's 160 over 90.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.930
- Let's page OB--
have them take a look.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.801
You're, uh, seven months along?

07:47.835 --> 07:48.802
- Yeah, why?

07:48.836 --> 07:49.803
- Honey, are you okay?

07:49.837 --> 07:50.904
- Everything's okay.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.840
- Your wife's blood pressure
is slightly elevated.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.274
I'd like to get some labs
and an ultrasound

07:54.307 --> 07:55.843
just as a precaution.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.645
- Is that necessary?

07:57.678 --> 07:59.012
I've been seeing my
doula regularly,

07:59.046 --> 08:00.213
and she says everything's good.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.949
I'm right on track
for home birth.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.952
- I know you must think we're
some granola-fed hipsters,

08:04.985 --> 08:06.053
but that's not it.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.955
- My sister miscarried
after an amnio,

08:07.988 --> 08:10.090
and I promised myself
I would do everything

08:10.123 --> 08:11.358
as natural as possible.

08:11.391 --> 08:14.194
That includes protecting my baby
from the harmful sound waves.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.096
- I understand completely.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.631
But in some cases,
high blood pressure

08:17.665 --> 08:18.732
can affect fetal growth.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.869
I just want to rule out
any possible complications.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.240
- Well, I guess it's good
to be on the safe side.

08:27.274 --> 08:28.676
Right, honey?

08:31.144 --> 08:34.181
- [speaking foreign language]

08:38.251 --> 08:40.253
- The patient's not
speaking Thai.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.623
If I had to guess based
on his inflection,

08:42.655 --> 08:44.324
it's an Indonesian dialect.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.094
If you want, I'll contact
the network administrator--

08:47.127 --> 08:48.295
see who they have in Jakarta.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.997
- Please. Thank you.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.599
- Thank you.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.701
- Okay, so, Mr. Clarke--

08:53.734 --> 08:56.937
fever, chills, vomit, diarrhea.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.106
- Chikungunya, Dengue.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.574
Yellow fever?

09:00.608 --> 09:03.611
- Maybe--that or one of 100
other diseases.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.145
Welcome to the future.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.914
Migration, climate change--

09:06.947 --> 09:08.716
the whole world
is on our doorstep.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.151
So what do you do when you have
an infectious disease

09:11.184 --> 09:12.319
of an unknown origin?

09:12.352 --> 09:15.956
- I'd start with CBC, CMP,

09:15.989 --> 09:18.125
blood, sputum, urine cultures...

09:18.158 --> 09:19.627
uh, rapid mono and strep.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.094
- Good.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.295
You start the H&P,

09:22.329 --> 09:23.296
and I'll put in the order

09:23.330 --> 09:25.198
and hang some IV metronidazole.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.934
- Will do.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.238
- Actually, totally my fault.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.640
Overdid it on the PT--

09:32.673 --> 09:34.307
had to do that last leg lift,

09:34.341 --> 09:36.243
and this is my reward.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.111
- [yawns]

09:38.145 --> 09:40.280
- Am I boring you, Doctor?
- Oh, no, sorry.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.115
I stayed up all night
attacking the library--

09:42.149 --> 09:43.383
got all the way to Bowlby.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.953
- Bowlby? Great stuff.
- Mm-hmm.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.354
- Made Charles Darwin
the fascination

09:47.387 --> 09:49.356
of an entire generation
of shrinks.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.725
- Bowlby said that Darwin
had a panic disorder.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.061
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
Charlie had a dark side.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.963
Wait till you get
to Barloon and Noyes.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.331
- Dr. Charles, Dr. Reese,
thanks for coming down.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.667
- What's up, Ethan?
What do you got?

09:59.700 --> 10:00.934
- Amanda Kendrick-Dobbs.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.135
Seven months pregnant,
gravid belly,

10:02.169 --> 10:05.138
history of fetal movement
and Braxton Hicks contractions--

10:05.172 --> 10:07.007
all signs of a normal pregnancy.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.010
- So what's the issue?

10:24.658 --> 10:24.758
.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.095
- Dr. Rhodes?

10:28.128 --> 10:29.963
I'm Leah Bardovi.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.766
I'm starting my surgical
residency here.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.969
- Welcome to Chicago Med.

10:36.003 --> 10:39.940
- So clinically speaking,
the patient will be dead?

10:39.973 --> 10:43.443
- Just long enough for me to do
the repair on his aorta.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.179
And then we will warm him up

10:46.213 --> 10:47.815
and restart the heart.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.717
- Hm.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.952
Did a lot of these
under Dr. Downey?

10:51.985 --> 10:53.420
- A few.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.923
- You know, he's the reason
I applied here.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.958
When I got my match,
I told my dad

10:57.991 --> 11:00.928
that I'm going to be training
under the greatest surgeon

11:00.961 --> 11:03.997
in the world.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.699
And now...

11:05.733 --> 11:08.401
I'm just honored to be learning
from his protÃ©gÃ©.

11:25.886 --> 11:26.987
- [exhales]

11:27.020 --> 11:28.221
Cooling jackets prepped?

11:28.255 --> 11:30.390
- Standing by.

11:30.423 --> 11:33.160
- Then let's do this.
Scalpel.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.170
- Appreciate the visit,

11:43.203 --> 11:45.773
but we just want to make sure
the baby's okay.

11:45.806 --> 11:46.874
Why are you here again?

11:46.907 --> 11:49.977
- Oh, we try and look in
on all our expectant mothers

11:50.010 --> 11:51.912
as part of a routine
wellness assessment.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.013
It was actually Dr. Reese who

11:53.046 --> 11:54.414
flagged your high
blood pressure.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.917
- Have you been under
any stress lately?

11:56.950 --> 11:58.451
Maybe something at work?

11:58.485 --> 11:59.887
- Oh, I'm not working.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.822
Uh, I haven't been since
we moved here last year.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.490
- Yeah, when my firm
transferred me from Denver,

12:03.523 --> 12:04.758
we thought it'd be a good time

12:04.792 --> 12:06.827
for Amanda to stay at home

12:06.860 --> 12:08.128
and focus on the baby.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.267
Where did you say
Dr. Choi was again?

12:14.301 --> 12:17.037
- Pretty sure he's just waiting
for the rest of your blood work.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.538
We will go check in
with him right now.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.773
Thanks both for your time.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.074
Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.445
- Notice how she didn't ask

12:25.478 --> 12:28.281
about any test results
or anything?

12:28.315 --> 12:29.817
- Oh.
- Yeah.

12:29.850 --> 12:30.851
- Yeah.

12:30.884 --> 12:34.054
- That's 'cause on some level,
she knows the truth.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.989
- So what are we looking at?

12:36.023 --> 12:38.826
- I don't know, Reese,
what are we looking at?

12:38.859 --> 12:40.928
- Uh, well,
no grandiose delusions

12:40.961 --> 12:43.096
or other signs of underlying
psychiatric illness,

12:43.130 --> 12:45.165
so I think we can
rule out psychosis.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.801
- Then how is this
even possible?

12:47.835 --> 12:49.202
- Well, in a lot of cases,

12:49.236 --> 12:52.305
the anxiety produces
a hormonal reaction--

12:52.339 --> 12:55.175
causes all of the physical
signs of pregnancy

12:55.208 --> 12:56.109
without a growing fetus.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.178
- We need to figure out
why having a baby's

12:58.211 --> 12:59.479
so important to her.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.081
- Or more specifically,

13:01.114 --> 13:03.951
why being pregnant is
so important to her.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.052
- Right.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.286
- So what do we do now?

13:06.319 --> 13:09.923
- I see no value in withholding
this from them any longer.

13:09.957 --> 13:13.126
So what do you say, Doctor?

13:14.895 --> 13:17.898
- You want m--
me to break the news?

13:24.137 --> 13:26.306
- No, don't worry, Grandma.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.541
No, I'll let you know as soon
as the tests come back.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.310
Me too.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.945
Bye.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.247
- Hey.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.548
- Hi.
- How's your sister?

13:35.582 --> 13:38.218
- Stubborn as ever.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.888
- I am here for you
if you need anything.

13:40.921 --> 13:41.889
Okay?

13:41.922 --> 13:42.956
- Thank you.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.127
- Dr. Manning?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.061
Hey, Mags.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.630
Uh, the translator
in Jakarta struck out.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.266
Apparently there are over
700 languages in Indonesia.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.135
- What about his fever?
- He's up to 104.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.170
- Let's get him into
a negative pressure room.

13:57.204 --> 13:59.973
Hang some IV Tylenol, and let's
see if there's any way

14:00.007 --> 14:01.141
we could put a rush
on those labs.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.209
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.149
- What was that?

14:09.182 --> 14:10.217
- What was what?

14:10.250 --> 14:11.985
- You, Jeff, the body language,

14:12.019 --> 14:13.220
the touching on the shoulder.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.055
Something is definitely up.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.189
- Hm?

14:16.223 --> 14:18.025
- You mean I'm right?

14:18.058 --> 14:19.326
[gasps]

14:20.693 --> 14:21.895
- Do you think it's weird?

14:21.929 --> 14:24.164
- What, you hooking up with your
late husband's best friend?

14:24.197 --> 14:26.299
- Not "hooking up."
- Whatever you want to call it.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.035
You're asking me if it's weird.
- Yeah.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.569
- Eh, a little.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.204
- [sighs]

14:31.238 --> 14:32.239
- Don't stress out about it.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.407
I learned a long time ago
that you have to do

14:34.441 --> 14:37.644
what makes you happy,

14:37.677 --> 14:40.247
even if some people
think it's strange.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.015
- Dr. Manning.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.216
- Okay.
[alarm blaring]

14:46.219 --> 14:49.089
- [wheezing]

14:49.122 --> 14:50.090
- What's happening?

14:50.123 --> 14:51.291
- He's in bronchospasm.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.260
- Let's bag him and get some
racemic epi

14:53.293 --> 14:56.229
and 125 milligrams
of solumedrol IV.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.066
- Sats are still dropping.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.600
- I need a better airway.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.103
Let's tube him.
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.105
- You're gonna intubate?
- Here you go.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.706
- He won't be able to speak
to a translator if we do that.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.941
- We don't have to worry
about a translator

15:07.975 --> 15:09.076
if he stops breathing.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.343
- [wheezing]

15:12.245 --> 15:15.048
- Dr. Manning.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.620
- I'm in.

15:20.653 --> 15:21.989
Start a neb treatment.
- I got it.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.090
- Sats are coming up.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.992
- There's got to be someone
somewhere in this city

15:25.025 --> 15:26.093
who can communicate
with this guy.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.260
- All right, I'm on it.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.100
- Placement's good.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.234
- Sorry.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.236
It felt like I
second-guessed you there.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.038
- Let's get him moved, okay?
- Yes, Doctor.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.407
Call upstairs.

16:02.229 --> 16:05.232
- All right, go on bypass.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.434
Cool to 20,
but do not crash cool.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.217
Find me when he gets
to 32 degrees,

16:24.251 --> 16:25.785
and we'll arrest the heart.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.187
- Yes, Dr. Rhodes.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.028
- So far, so good.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.364
He's taken well
to the anesthetic.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.167
We should be able to start
the repair in an hour or so.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.434
- Thank you, Dr. Rhodes.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.203
- Mrs. Simon was just telling me

16:43.236 --> 16:46.806
how impressed she was
with your confidence.

16:46.839 --> 16:47.807
- [chuckles]

16:47.840 --> 16:49.242
- Could you excuse us, please?

16:49.276 --> 16:51.344
I need a quick word
with Dr. Rhodes here.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.352
Where's Dr. Latham?

16:59.386 --> 17:01.054
- I was just about to page him.

17:01.088 --> 17:03.490
- You signed up for
a high-risk surgery

17:03.523 --> 17:05.525
without consulting
an attending?

17:05.558 --> 17:08.761
- All I did was open him up
and cannulate.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.329
It is the Sabbath.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.732
I didn't want to bother
Dr. Latham until I had to.

17:12.765 --> 17:16.336
- Glenn Simon is a man
with lots of connections.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.839
You were worried before about
the state of the department.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.075
You'll have even more
to worry about

17:22.108 --> 17:25.778
if you don't
pull this off.

17:25.811 --> 17:29.516
Page Dr. Latham now.

17:35.822 --> 17:36.756
- [sighs]

17:36.789 --> 17:38.591
These machines are the worst.
- [chuckles]

17:38.625 --> 17:41.328
You obviously haven't
seen the ones down in pathology.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.496
- I'd kill for
a bag of Vitner's.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.865
- Don't overthink it.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.502
Go for the next best thing.

17:49.536 --> 17:52.305
- Hey, Will, you got a second
for a curbside?

17:52.339 --> 17:53.373
- Yeah.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.443
- Thanks.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.614
- Rapid strep and mono
were negative, LP normal.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.383
I'm afraid
it's something exotic,

18:03.416 --> 18:05.118
but we won't have the cultures
back for another couple of days.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.553
And now with
the bronchospasm--

18:06.586 --> 18:07.854
- Yeah, it could be
almost anything.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.422
- Exactly.

18:09.456 --> 18:13.226
I gotta confess,
I am at a complete loss.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.528
- Oh.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.630
Well, whenever I find
myself in the weeds,

18:17.664 --> 18:19.232
I go back to something

18:19.266 --> 18:22.135
one of my clinical attendings
used to say--

18:22.169 --> 18:26.273
the answer is always
in the history.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.175
- That's your
pearl of wisdom?

18:28.208 --> 18:30.243
We can't get a history.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.579
We're lost in a maze.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.846
- Then retrace your steps.
- [sighs]

18:33.880 --> 18:37.150
Every decision you made, each
path you took or didn't take.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.618
Examine it all.

18:38.651 --> 18:39.886
- Sorry, Nat.

18:39.919 --> 18:44.424
Will, what do the presence of
retinal autoantibodies indicate?

18:44.457 --> 18:48.161
- What?

18:48.195 --> 18:50.163
- This mean what I think
it means?

18:59.772 --> 18:59.906
.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.242
- I have cancer?

19:02.275 --> 19:03.943
- Possibly.
- Possibly?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.745
- We don't know for sure.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.548
- There's a chance
that your loss of vision

19:08.581 --> 19:11.551
was caused by your body
fighting some kind of tumor.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.586
- Is there any history of cancer
in your family?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.922
- I don't know.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.825
- Uncle Paul. He's fighting
bladder cancer right now.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.527
- Really?

19:20.560 --> 19:22.695
- Any other medical history
I should know?

19:22.729 --> 19:26.866
Any injuries or any illnesses
or surgeries?

19:26.899 --> 19:29.902
- No.
- Denise?

19:29.936 --> 19:31.571
- No.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.773
- I'm gonna send you over
for a CT scan.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.975
In the meantime,

19:36.008 --> 19:39.246
let's take a quick look.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.684
[knock on door]

19:44.717 --> 19:45.685
- Enter.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.621
[door opens]

19:48.655 --> 19:51.291
If you require lights, you'll
have to turn them on yourself.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.793
Sabbath rules.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.928
- Dr. Latham, I understand
I should have consulted you

19:55.962 --> 19:57.930
before recommending
surgery,

19:57.964 --> 20:00.600
but I'd developed a rapport
with Mrs. Simon,

20:00.633 --> 20:02.635
and I thought since
you observe the Sabbath--

20:02.669 --> 20:04.671
- Pikuach nefesh.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.840
A man's life
always takes precedence.

20:07.874 --> 20:11.544
So you plan on
opening up the heart,

20:11.578 --> 20:13.613
tying off
the bifurcated branch,

20:13.646 --> 20:15.948
and closing everything
back up in 30 minutes?

20:15.982 --> 20:17.284
- Mm-hmm.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.287
- Any longer and there could be
significant cognitive deficits.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.788
- I understand.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.490
- If you don't
over-sew the connection,

20:23.523 --> 20:26.959
he could develop
a deadly pseudoaneurysm.

20:26.993 --> 20:31.931
That might take an even
experienced surgeon an hour.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.900
- Pardon me, Dr. Rhodes.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.802
The patient's temp
is down to 32 degrees.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.938
- Thank you, Leah.

20:38.971 --> 20:42.642
- You realize that by waiting
as long as you did to call me,

20:42.675 --> 20:46.579
you've given us
no other surgical option.

20:46.613 --> 20:49.682
- I thought this was
our best course.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.518
- 30 minutes.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.653
- I can make it in time.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.922
I've done surgeries equally
as challenging before.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.857
- While assisting
Dr. Downey.

20:57.890 --> 21:00.960
- Yes.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.798
- In the cockpit,
a copilot's seat

21:05.832 --> 21:07.567
is right next
to the captain's,

21:07.600 --> 21:10.637
but the view out of the window
is surprisingly different.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.044
- Our--our bodies
are complicated.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.946
Sometimes signals
get crossed,

21:19.979 --> 21:22.382
and our--our brains
say one thing

21:22.415 --> 21:23.816
and our bodies hear
something else.

21:23.850 --> 21:24.951
- I don't understand.

21:24.984 --> 21:29.356
Is there something wrong
with the baby?

21:29.389 --> 21:31.391
- Yes. Well...

21:31.424 --> 21:33.960
not exactly.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.629
It's complicated.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.865
- What exactly
are you saying?

21:38.898 --> 21:41.100
- [exhales sharply]

21:41.133 --> 21:44.371
Um...

21:45.872 --> 21:47.374
- Well, is there someone here
who can actually explain to us

21:47.407 --> 21:48.174
what's going on, please?

21:48.207 --> 21:49.442
- If you give Dr. Reese
a minute,

21:49.476 --> 21:51.844
I think that you'll find that
she has an excellent grasp of--

21:51.878 --> 21:53.045
- So go ahead.

21:53.079 --> 21:55.848
Explain, Dr. Reese.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.750
- I am sorry,

21:57.784 --> 22:01.120
but there is no baby.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.623
- We lost the baby?

22:03.656 --> 22:05.392
- No.
You never had one.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.993
- You don't know
what you're talking about.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.128
- No, see, the--the evidence
is actually right here.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.632
You have a condition
called pseudocyesis.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.968
You may have heard it referred
to as a hysterical pregnancy.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.670
- Are you saying
my wife is crazy?

22:17.704 --> 22:19.005
- No, she's not.
She's not saying that at all.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.873
She's saying that sometimes
the mind has the ability

22:20.907 --> 22:22.141
to play tricks
on the body.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.712
- I can feel my baby. I don't
care what this ultrasound shows.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.013
It--Your machine
must be broken.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.881
- I can assure you it's not.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.149
Your blood test confirms it.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.150
- Well, then
your lab's broken, too.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.085
I'm pregnant.
I am!

22:33.119 --> 22:34.086
- Honey.
Hey, hey, hey.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.055
- No! No.
- Back off.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.056
- No! No!
- Honey, honey.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.925
No! Get away from her!
- Get me out of here!

22:38.958 --> 22:40.092
- We need some help in here!

22:40.126 --> 22:42.895
- [screams and cries]

22:42.929 --> 22:45.665
- Shh. It's okay.
It's okay.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.033
- No!
- Hey, hey, hey!

22:47.066 --> 22:50.069
- No!
[crying]

22:57.944 --> 22:59.446
- Where are we?

22:59.479 --> 23:01.814
- Body temperature's
at 20 degrees Celsius.

23:01.848 --> 23:04.917
- Flow down.

23:04.951 --> 23:07.954
Clamp.
- Clamp.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.895
- Clamp is on.
Give cardioplegia.

23:15.928 --> 23:18.965
- Plegia's on.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.737
- Heart's arrested.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.839
- Start the clock.
Stage is yours, Dr. Rhodes.

23:26.873 --> 23:29.909
- Metz and DeBakey.
- Here you go, Doctor.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.523
- Okay.

23:43.556 --> 23:47.026
Upper abdomen looks clear.

23:47.059 --> 23:50.096
Wait a minute.
What's this?

23:52.264 --> 23:54.100
I think this thing
is acting up again.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.202
Maggie, do me a favor
and reboot it.

23:56.235 --> 24:00.006
- I had it serviced last week.
It should be fine.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.208
- Yeah,
but right here.

24:02.241 --> 24:05.478
- [breathes heavily]

24:10.249 --> 24:13.486
It's my prostate gland.

24:36.208 --> 24:36.342
.

24:37.409 --> 24:41.681
- My doctor recommended
not removing the prostate

24:41.714 --> 24:44.584
'cause the surgery would be
too complicated.

24:44.617 --> 24:47.854
- Well, it's definitely
enlarged.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.255
Before I send you over
to the scan,

24:49.288 --> 24:52.224
I'm gonna need to order
another panel.

24:52.258 --> 24:53.960
Maggie, run down
to phlebotomy

24:53.993 --> 24:57.263
and have them draw up a CMP
and check her PSA levels?

24:57.296 --> 24:59.866
- Tina can do that for you.
I'm a civilian today.

24:59.899 --> 25:03.770
- But you have much
more sway with the lab.

25:05.572 --> 25:08.608
- I'll be right back, okay?

25:09.809 --> 25:12.178
If you want me out of the room,
just say so.

25:12.211 --> 25:13.746
- Well, excuse me.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.882
Why didn't you tell me
your sister used to be a man?

25:15.915 --> 25:17.950
- It's not my place.
It's up to the patient.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.919
- Then you should've
gotten her to tell me.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.788
This is crucial
medical history.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.590
- [sighs]

25:23.623 --> 25:26.593
- How long ago
did she transition?

25:26.626 --> 25:29.662
- About nine years ago.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.200
[sighs]

25:34.233 --> 25:36.636
- Was it hard for you?
- Harder for her.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.607
- Hmm.

25:40.640 --> 25:44.310
If it were my family...

25:44.343 --> 25:46.879
she would have
been disowned.

25:46.913 --> 25:49.949
- Well, it's taken time.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.622
We had a lot to learn.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.930
[cries]

26:03.963 --> 26:06.699
- Mr. Dobbs, please calm down.
We just want to help you.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.701
- You've done enough.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.336
The second she wakes up,
we're outta here.

26:10.369 --> 26:11.971
- I think that
would be a mistake,

26:12.004 --> 26:13.740
but I'm not gonna
stand in your way.

26:13.773 --> 26:16.809
- We're done.

26:21.380 --> 26:22.548
- So?

26:22.581 --> 26:25.351
- He's taking her home as soon
as the sedative wears off.

26:25.384 --> 26:26.819
- We're gonna
let them leave?

26:26.853 --> 26:27.920
- Yep.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.255
- We can't put her on
a psych hold?

26:29.288 --> 26:30.890
- Doesn't meet
the criteria.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.358
I mean, is she a danger
to herself or others?

26:32.391 --> 26:34.794
Is she unable to take care of
her basic needs?

26:34.827 --> 26:35.828
- I've been doing
some reading.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.764
There was this one case
where they put a woman

26:37.797 --> 26:40.032
under anesthesia
and her belly deflated

26:40.066 --> 26:42.234
and--and she thought
she had a miscarriage.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.703
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:43.736 --> 26:47.039
Are--are you actually suggesting
that we do that?

26:49.876 --> 26:51.911
- I'll go get
her discharge started.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.981
- So we're giving up?

26:59.418 --> 27:01.654
- When's the last time
you had some sleep?

27:01.688 --> 27:03.656
- Are you sending me home?

27:03.690 --> 27:06.425
- No, I just think it might be
a good idea to get some rest.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.728
You know?
You've been up all night.

27:08.761 --> 27:11.798
Come back tomorrow,
start fresh.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.370
- Yeah, you're--

27:18.404 --> 27:20.840
You're--you're right.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.910
I should get out of here.

27:27.079 --> 27:30.316
- Do you know how many cases
we're looking at yet?

27:30.349 --> 27:31.851
- Natalie.
- One second.

27:31.884 --> 27:34.020
Okay.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.122
Yes, I will test him right now
and send over the results

27:36.155 --> 27:37.890
as soon as we get them.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.759
Thank you.

27:39.792 --> 27:40.793
- Who was that?

27:40.827 --> 27:41.794
- Health department.

27:41.828 --> 27:44.831
Looks like our John Doe
might have the measles.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.799
- Measles? But he doesn't have
any Koplik's spots.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.100
- Doesn't always present
that way.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.135
- Well, then how
did you figure--

27:49.168 --> 27:52.138
- Ah.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.139
- It's a belt buckle.

27:53.172 --> 27:56.876
- Flip it over.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.045
- "I survived the Stampede"?

27:59.078 --> 28:00.780
- It's a roller coaster.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.381
That amusement park
down in Champaign,

28:02.414 --> 28:04.917
they just confirmed that they
had an outbreak of the measles.

28:04.951 --> 28:07.887
Five cases,
kids who were never vaccinated.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.857
This whole time we were
assuming that he brought

28:10.890 --> 28:12.859
this exotic disease
into the country with him.

28:12.892 --> 28:15.061
And now, it actually looks
like he caught it here.

28:15.094 --> 28:18.130
The labs will confirm it.

28:20.366 --> 28:21.467
What?

28:21.500 --> 28:23.069
- No, I've known you
all these years

28:23.102 --> 28:26.005
and I never realized
how genius you are.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.439
I'm serious.

28:27.473 --> 28:29.475
How did you even think
to look at the belt buckle?

28:29.508 --> 28:32.745
- When you're in the weeds,
always go back to the history.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.118
- No, no, wait!
Wait for me!

28:39.151 --> 28:42.188
[sighs]

28:50.963 --> 28:51.898
- Perfect.

28:51.931 --> 28:54.166
My husband just went
to go get the car, so--

28:54.200 --> 28:56.102
- I'm really sorry.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.404
I wish I had done a better job
explaining things.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.472
- Explain what?

29:00.506 --> 29:02.842
That I'm hysterical?

29:02.875 --> 29:04.476
That I'm not
carrying a baby?

29:04.510 --> 29:06.913
- I'm sure my boss is regretting
ever offering me this position,

29:06.946 --> 29:09.816
and I really wanted to be good
at it, and now,

29:09.849 --> 29:11.984
well, again, I'm--

29:12.018 --> 29:15.054
I'm really sorry.

29:16.255 --> 29:19.558
- You're lucky.

29:19.591 --> 29:23.529
- What?
I'm lucky?

29:23.562 --> 29:26.799
- You care about
what you do.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.203
You know what I did
before I moved here?

29:31.237 --> 29:34.140
I was a skier,
an extreme skier.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.542
- Wow, sounds like
quite an adrenaline rush.

29:36.575 --> 29:40.146
- Yeah, but it was
more than that.

29:40.179 --> 29:43.182
It wasn't just
something that I did.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.450
- But it was
who you were.

29:44.483 --> 29:47.486
- Yeah.

29:47.519 --> 29:51.490
What you said
about my baby,

29:51.523 --> 29:53.993
is it true?

29:54.026 --> 29:57.063
- Yeah.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.042
- Maggie?
- What happened?

30:10.076 --> 30:11.443
- She wouldn't
let me examine her.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.846
She's leaving.
- What?

30:13.880 --> 30:14.746
- Did you know
it was offensive

30:14.780 --> 30:18.017
to use the word
"transgender" as a noun?

30:18.050 --> 30:19.051
- [sighs]

30:19.085 --> 30:21.120
- I-I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.221
- Okay.

30:22.254 --> 30:25.591
- Yeah.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.193
- What happened?

30:27.226 --> 30:28.560
- Exactly what
I should have expected

30:28.594 --> 30:30.196
from a dude
from Canaryville.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.031
- Oh, come on, Denise,
he's a little awkward and all,

30:32.064 --> 30:34.133
but he's good people.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.868
And a great doctor.
- You know what?

30:35.902 --> 30:38.004
I'll have my prostate checked
when I get back.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.906
- No!
You're not leaving,

30:39.939 --> 30:42.074
not without
a definitive diagnosis.

30:42.108 --> 30:44.610
You need to have all this
checked out annually, Denise.

30:44.643 --> 30:47.146
- You want to know why
I don't come back that much?

30:47.179 --> 30:50.182
I don't always need everybody
judging my choices, okay?

30:50.216 --> 30:52.284
- Please, the family?
They embrace you.

30:52.318 --> 30:54.921
- I'm not talking
about the family.

30:54.954 --> 30:57.056
I'm talking about you.

30:57.089 --> 31:00.092
The second I see you at
the family reunion, you're--

31:00.126 --> 31:02.028
you're throwing shade about
how you were born this way.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.295
- I was mocking myself.

31:03.329 --> 31:05.898
- Just admit it.

31:05.932 --> 31:08.100
You hate what I've done
to myself.

31:08.134 --> 31:10.669
- I miss my brother.
Is that such a bad thing?

31:10.702 --> 31:12.204
- Well, he's gone,
damn it!

31:12.238 --> 31:14.340
- Not to me!

31:14.373 --> 31:17.543
Not totally!

31:27.219 --> 31:29.956
Look, I'm sorry
that I hurt you,

31:29.989 --> 31:32.258
but I'm not gonna
lose you.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.659
So if I have to drag you
kicking and screaming

31:33.692 --> 31:36.929
into that CT scanner,
that's what I'm gonna do.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.138
- I'm scared.

31:46.172 --> 31:49.208
- We'll get through this.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.022
- Time?

32:03.055 --> 32:04.190
- Six minutes.

32:04.223 --> 32:05.691
- Precisely.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.259
- 6 minutes,
11 seconds.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.028
- You still have
another layer to go.

32:09.061 --> 32:09.895
- Damn it.
More suction.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.964
- You have a clear line
to the vessel.

32:11.998 --> 32:13.165
Suction is not your problem.

32:13.199 --> 32:14.300
You're not gonna make it.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.402
- I have plenty of time.
- Not at the pace you're going.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.371
You've done 57% of the work
in 81% of your allotted time.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.073
You are not
gonna get there.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.642
- Your nonstop number crunching
isn't helping.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.311
- 30 minutes.
That's what we agreed.

32:25.344 --> 32:28.047
That's what
you promised.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.215
[scoffs]

32:29.248 --> 32:30.416
I'm taking over.
Step aside, Dr. Rhodes.

32:30.449 --> 32:33.619
- I can do this.
- Step aside!

32:51.103 --> 32:53.172
Dr. Downey may have been quick
to put his faith in you,

33:06.318 --> 33:06.452
.

33:08.287 --> 33:10.622
- I've spent nearly
my entire life

33:10.656 --> 33:13.692
feeling at war
with my gender.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.763
It figures, the one piece
I didn't get rid of

33:17.796 --> 33:21.033
is what's gonna kill me.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.503
[knock on door]

33:29.775 --> 33:31.810
- Your biopsy came back.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.646
Pretty much
what we suspected.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.416
You have prostate cancer.

33:37.449 --> 33:41.287
With treatment,
I am hopeful it can be cured.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.554
But you'll need to see
a urologist

33:42.588 --> 33:45.291
as soon as you get home.

33:45.324 --> 33:47.459
- Thank you.

33:47.493 --> 33:49.695
- You're welcome.

33:49.728 --> 33:52.564
There is a second option.

33:52.598 --> 33:55.301
You could stay in Chicago

33:55.334 --> 33:58.404
and let us take care of you.

33:59.405 --> 34:02.441
- I'd like that.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.313
- Okay.

34:07.346 --> 34:09.547
Okay.

34:09.581 --> 34:12.618
- Okay.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.554
- Hey, you tracked down
a translator?

34:16.588 --> 34:18.623
- No.
That's his cousin, Farah.

34:18.657 --> 34:19.791
Turns out
his name is Pitopang.

34:19.824 --> 34:21.293
He speaks Mamuju.

34:21.327 --> 34:22.828
Came here from West Sulawesi
a month ago

34:22.860 --> 34:24.730
to work in
his uncle's restaurant.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.665
Always wanted to ride
a roller coaster.

34:26.697 --> 34:29.735
- Wow. Nice, April.

34:29.768 --> 34:31.803
Okay.

34:31.837 --> 34:33.804
Hi, I'm Doctor Manning.

34:33.839 --> 34:35.841
Your cousin has
the measles,

34:35.873 --> 34:38.643
but he should make
a full recovery.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.713
- [speaking Mamuju]

34:46.585 --> 34:49.554
- [speaking Mamuju]

34:54.826 --> 34:56.795
- My cousin said thank you,

34:56.828 --> 35:00.098
and he thinks you two
make a great couple.

35:09.475 --> 35:12.411
- And yes, ladies,
he is fluent in Spanish.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.445
- [speaking Spanish]

35:13.479 --> 35:14.713
- You think he hired
a publicist?

35:14.746 --> 35:16.648
- Doesn't need to.
He's a Rhodes.

35:16.682 --> 35:19.618
- Plus,
he looks like that.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.387
- Hey!

35:21.420 --> 35:22.854
- There's our rising star.

35:22.888 --> 35:24.723
- Yes!

35:24.756 --> 35:28.727
- What are you talking about?

35:28.760 --> 35:31.597
"40 Rising Stars Under 40"?

35:31.630 --> 35:33.465
- Yeah, you're number 11.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.601
- Hey, don't feel bad.
There's always next year.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.636
- Or maybe
the cover of "People."

35:37.669 --> 35:39.371
- [laughs sarcastically]

35:39.405 --> 35:41.807
I swear,
I knew nothing about this.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.609
- If you say so.

35:43.642 --> 35:44.710
- Sure.

35:44.743 --> 35:47.713
- By the way,
how'd the surgery go?

35:47.746 --> 35:50.782
- Yeah, it was--
it was good.

35:58.857 --> 36:01.393
- Thought you were
going home.

36:01.427 --> 36:04.663
- I was just going
back over Darwin.

36:04.696 --> 36:06.365
According to Hayman,

36:06.398 --> 36:08.867
Darwin's issues might have been
entirely physiological.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.803
Perhaps some kind of
mitochondrial disorder.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.639
- Huh.
- Mm-hmm.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.507
- You don't say.
- Mm-hmm.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.943
Yeah, I ran into Amanda
on my way out,

36:17.976 --> 36:20.979
and I found out that she
used to be an extreme skier.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.214
- Really?

36:22.248 --> 36:24.983
- Mm-hmm.

36:25.016 --> 36:28.454
I don't know,
maybe being pregnant

36:28.487 --> 36:32.624
was her way of replacing
what she had left behind.

36:33.725 --> 36:36.762
- Nature abhors a vacuum,
I guess.

36:41.967 --> 36:45.203
Speaking of which...

36:47.906 --> 36:50.942
you mind?

37:05.757 --> 37:08.260
[knock on door]

37:08.294 --> 37:09.628
- Ms. Goodwin?

37:09.661 --> 37:11.963
- Dr. Rhodes.

37:11.997 --> 37:13.799
- I don't know
if you've seen this,

37:13.832 --> 37:16.868
but there's
a new issue out.

37:18.704 --> 37:20.706
Yeah.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.542
I had no idea that I was gonna
be a part of this article.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.477
No one called
or contacted me,

37:25.511 --> 37:27.979
and--and if they had,
I never would have--

37:28.013 --> 37:30.582
- I approved it.

37:30.616 --> 37:32.751
- You did?

37:32.784 --> 37:34.553
- It's good publicity.

37:34.586 --> 37:37.823
- Yes, but did you
actually read this?

37:37.856 --> 37:40.726
I mean,
"Dashing young surgeon

37:40.759 --> 37:44.062
is poised to lead Chicago Med
into the future."

37:44.095 --> 37:47.499
- No, I have no problem
with that.

37:50.969 --> 37:53.071
- Ms. Goodwin,

37:53.104 --> 37:56.842
look, the surgery
today...

37:56.875 --> 38:00.879
Dr. Latham was right,
I wasn't gonna make it.

38:00.912 --> 38:04.983
I thought I was
more ready than I am.

38:05.016 --> 38:06.852
So if you're looking
to promote the department,

38:06.885 --> 38:08.687
you should look to him.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.589
I mean,
he is a great surgeon.

38:10.622 --> 38:11.423
- Latham is
a great surgeon,

38:11.457 --> 38:14.560
but they wanted someone
under 40.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.595
Stay humble, Dr. Rhodes.

38:16.628 --> 38:19.865
Your time will come.

38:24.069 --> 38:26.772
- Huh? What do you think?

38:26.805 --> 38:27.773
Too big?

38:27.806 --> 38:30.342
- No, you'll grow into it.

38:30.376 --> 38:33.078
You are now an honorary member
of the Lockwood tribe.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.112
- Thank you.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.914
I will wear it
with pride.

38:35.947 --> 38:37.883
- Who are you looking at?

38:37.916 --> 38:40.085
- No one.

38:40.118 --> 38:43.889
- Oh. That cute pathologist,
Dr. Shore.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.090
- Nina.
- Nina?

38:45.123 --> 38:46.992
- Yeah.
- Oh.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.795
Well, don't feel like you have
to stay here and entertain me.

38:49.828 --> 38:52.063
I've seen enough of you
for one day.

38:52.097 --> 38:55.000
- Okay.

38:55.033 --> 38:56.067
How do I look?

38:56.101 --> 38:59.371
- Mm.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.675
You know, when I think
about Malcolm,

39:03.709 --> 39:05.844
it's times like these
that I miss the most.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.914
- Malcolm?

39:13.719 --> 39:16.722
Oh.

39:18.123 --> 39:21.126
- Go on.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.002
- Hey.

39:31.036 --> 39:33.405
- Hey.

39:33.439 --> 39:36.608
You ever figure out
what you wanted?

39:37.643 --> 39:38.710
- Yeah.

39:38.744 --> 39:41.747
Yeah, I think I did.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.743
- At Johns Hopkins they have
a Shabbat elevator.

40:11.777 --> 40:14.646
It stops on every floor.

40:14.680 --> 40:18.450
No need to press a button.

40:18.484 --> 40:21.152
What can you do?

40:21.186 --> 40:24.189
- Down?

40:41.106 --> 40:45.143
Good Shabbos,
Dr. Latham.

40:45.176 --> 40:48.213
- Shabbat shalom,
Dr. Rhodes.
