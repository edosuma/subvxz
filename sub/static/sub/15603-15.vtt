00:01.008 --> 00:03.009
Previously
on <i>Covert Affairs...</i>

00:03.010 --> 00:04.811
Back from Geneva already?

00:04.845 --> 00:06.396
I go where
Henry Wilcox goes.

00:06.430 --> 00:08.064
We have transcripts

00:08.099 --> 00:09.933
of Henry's phone calls
in Geneva.

00:09.984 --> 00:11.151
We have photographs
of him

00:11.185 --> 00:12.435
with his contacts there.

00:12.486 --> 00:14.904
The world needs to know
what Henry's done.

00:14.939 --> 00:16.419
Teo and Annie are dead
because of him.

00:16.440 --> 00:17.824
I can use whatever resources
I can

00:17.858 --> 00:19.559
to out Henry
and get our lives back.

00:19.577 --> 00:21.077
Our main goal now
is to defend Arthur

00:21.112 --> 00:24.914
against these charges,
not counterpunch recklessly.

00:24.949 --> 00:26.282
Annie?

00:26.334 --> 00:27.400
You're alive.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.704
- You got Henry?
- No.

00:30.738 --> 00:32.671
He set up a decoy.
Where the hell's Henry?

00:32.707 --> 00:34.758
We're gonna
get him, Auggie.

00:34.792 --> 00:37.010
- How?
- I need to find Nelson Smith.

00:37.044 --> 00:39.095
He's the one who's moving
Henry's money.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.597
When did he tell you
to move the money?

00:40.631 --> 00:42.465
- Late last night.
- Where'd you take it?

00:42.516 --> 00:44.467
To a diamond wholesaler
in Brooklyn.

00:44.518 --> 00:46.519
Courier's picking it up
this afternoon.

00:46.554 --> 00:48.755
- Where's he taking them?
- Henry's pickin' up shop.

00:48.773 --> 00:49.973
He's movin'
to Hong Kong.

00:50.024 --> 00:51.691
Why is he going
to Hong Kong?

00:51.726 --> 00:52.942
If we don't come back
with anything,

00:52.977 --> 00:55.979
this is basically
a one-way trip.

01:28.179 --> 01:30.096
This is a big-ass haystack
of a city

01:30.130 --> 01:31.130
to find
a needle in.

01:31.148 --> 01:32.515
Those diamonds
Annie tracked down

01:32.566 --> 01:33.933
in New York
are Henry's future.

01:33.967 --> 01:35.518
He's gotta come out
sooner or later to get 'em.

01:35.569 --> 01:38.137
Catching him here
is gonna be complicated.

01:38.155 --> 01:40.073
This is the clearest mission
I've had in months.

01:40.107 --> 01:41.858
We track the diamond courier
to Henry,

01:41.909 --> 01:43.493
we grab Henry,
and we take him back

01:43.527 --> 01:44.994
to pay
for what he's done.

01:45.029 --> 01:47.614
It's an unsanctioned mission
on Chinese soil.

01:47.648 --> 01:50.417
We just gotta remember
to play by Hong Kong rules.

01:50.451 --> 01:52.619
Every neighbor
could be a spy.

01:52.653 --> 01:55.488
MSS is the biggest
big brother there is.

01:55.506 --> 01:58.174
Three off-book CIA operatives

01:58.209 --> 02:00.427
with a lot of intel
to get tortured out of.

02:00.461 --> 02:02.495
And if we get caught,
it won't be pretty.

02:02.513 --> 02:03.963
Welcome to my world.

02:03.997 --> 02:06.099
I've been operating this way
for months.

02:06.133 --> 02:07.383
There it is.
A safe house.

02:07.435 --> 02:08.501
That pass is scheduled
to happen

02:08.519 --> 02:09.519
in less
than an hour.

02:09.553 --> 02:10.836
We got to get you guys
in position

02:10.854 --> 02:12.772
on those escalators
before the courier gets there.

02:12.807 --> 02:16.059
Let's move.

02:18.679 --> 02:21.030
- Joan?
- Arthur.

02:21.065 --> 02:22.482
I have
to tell you something,

02:22.516 --> 02:24.567
but I didn't want to talk
about it on the phone.

02:24.618 --> 02:26.569
If this is about Teo,
I'm not gonna pretend

02:26.620 --> 02:27.904
that ordering
the torture of my son

02:27.955 --> 02:28.955
is something
I can forget.

02:28.956 --> 02:29.956
Arthur--

02:29.990 --> 02:31.491
But I know the reason
you left is--

02:31.525 --> 02:33.326
is just 'cause of the way
I reacted.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.329
That's not
why I left.

02:36.363 --> 02:39.031
I found Annie.

02:39.049 --> 02:42.969
She's alive.

02:50.845 --> 02:52.011
No sign of the courier
at the top.

02:52.045 --> 02:53.012
I'm headed down.

02:53.046 --> 02:54.380
Calder, keep headin' up.

02:54.398 --> 02:56.065
No courier yet,
but it's a nice hike.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.066
Yeah, sorry about that.

02:57.101 --> 02:59.903
Escalators only go down
in the morning.

02:59.937 --> 03:01.070
All right.

03:01.105 --> 03:02.822
You both should be reaching
Hollywood Road

03:02.857 --> 03:04.023
in about a minute.

03:04.057 --> 03:05.992
That's where the pass
should take place.

03:06.026 --> 03:08.194
Stay a level or two away
from each other, okay?

03:08.228 --> 03:09.496
What, you mean
a white woman

03:09.530 --> 03:11.364
and a black guy
might be easy to spot?

03:11.398 --> 03:12.448
Well, next time,
I'll come along

03:12.500 --> 03:16.002
so we're not
too conspicuous.

03:43.113 --> 03:44.197
Calder, I got him.

03:44.231 --> 03:47.817
Blue shirt, tan jacket.

03:47.868 --> 03:49.569
He's headed
to the intersection

03:49.603 --> 03:52.238
of Lyndhurst and Gage.

03:52.272 --> 03:54.407
He's got the case.
Right on time.

03:54.441 --> 03:56.209
On my way.

03:56.243 --> 03:59.295
Keep an eye out
for the pass.

04:16.964 --> 04:20.800
Annie, you got anything?

04:23.153 --> 04:27.190
I lost him.

04:41.538 --> 04:43.256
Any sign of him?

04:43.290 --> 04:47.827
I-I--Calder,
do you have him?

04:50.381 --> 04:54.968
I got nothin'
on my end.

05:01.525 --> 05:02.508
I got him.

05:02.526 --> 05:03.843
Does he still
have the briefcase?

05:03.861 --> 05:08.114
Any sign of Henry?

05:08.148 --> 05:09.232
He doesn't have
the case.

05:09.283 --> 05:10.516
Damn it.
Grab that courier.

05:10.534 --> 05:11.901
He's our only line
back to Henry.

05:11.952 --> 05:15.288
We lose him,
we got nothin'.

05:20.360 --> 05:24.831
He's headed down the stairs
to Lyndhurst Terrace.

05:27.251 --> 05:31.671
I got him.
I got eyes on him.

05:37.561 --> 05:39.562
- He's on the run.
- I got him, I got him.

05:39.596 --> 05:41.014
Calder.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.521
Ah! No!

05:50.407 --> 05:53.776
What just happened?

05:55.779 --> 05:57.780
I think he's dead.

05:57.945 --> 06:01.945

06:22.214 --> 06:23.431
We can't let anybody
see us here.

06:23.465 --> 06:24.749
Hong Kong police force'll
be all over this.

06:24.767 --> 06:26.351
Wait, that's
what I'm hoping for.

06:26.385 --> 06:27.918
What are
you talking about?

06:27.936 --> 06:30.305
Dead or alive, he's still
our only lead to Henry.

06:30.356 --> 06:34.425
No, Annie.
No, Ann--

06:34.443 --> 06:36.227
Excuse me.

06:36.261 --> 06:37.595
I saw this man
at the escalator.

06:37.613 --> 06:39.113
He was talking
to someone.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.931
What happened, miss?

06:40.949 --> 06:42.817
He was on the escalators
arguing with someone,

06:42.868 --> 06:44.369
and then he started
running away.

06:44.403 --> 06:45.936
- Was he a friend of yours?
- No.

06:45.954 --> 06:48.039
No, I--
Calder, what is she doing?

06:48.073 --> 06:49.374
I think he's dead.
Going to the cops.

06:49.408 --> 06:52.410
She's--

06:52.444 --> 06:54.162
All right, let her
follow it down.

06:54.213 --> 06:55.330
Let her follow
it down.

06:55.381 --> 06:57.882
Excuse me.

06:57.916 --> 06:58.949
And you didn't get
a good look

06:58.967 --> 07:00.501
at this person
he was talking to?

07:00.552 --> 07:02.170
It was a big crowd,
but I might recognize him

07:02.221 --> 07:03.755
if I saw him again.

07:03.789 --> 07:04.806
You will need
to come to the station

07:04.840 --> 07:06.090
and answer some questions.

07:06.124 --> 07:09.394
- Okay.
- Come with me.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.235
Annie called an audible,
ran right into the fray.

07:17.269 --> 07:19.354
Yeah, she's using the police
to help I.D.

07:19.405 --> 07:21.138
whoever the courier passed
that briefcase to.

07:21.156 --> 07:22.240
And improvising like that

07:22.274 --> 07:24.359
puts this entire operation
in jeopardy.

07:24.410 --> 07:25.860
Henry could already be
onto us.

07:25.911 --> 07:27.745
What are you talkin' about?
Whoever took that briefcase

07:27.780 --> 07:29.664
is now our only link to Henry
in Hong Kong.

07:29.698 --> 07:31.416
Yeah, how are we gonna beat
Henry Wilcox

07:31.450 --> 07:33.868
if Annie keeps operating
like she's by herself?

07:33.919 --> 07:36.120
Calder, the only reason
we're this close to Henry

07:36.154 --> 07:39.090
is because of what Annie did
when she was on her own.

07:39.124 --> 07:41.125
Now I can't hack into
the security cameras

07:41.159 --> 07:42.993
on the escalators,
so if you want to know

07:43.011 --> 07:45.680
who Henry gave his entire
fortune to in that briefcase,

07:45.714 --> 07:47.715
Annie's our best chance.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.901
Miss.
This way, please.

08:06.952 --> 08:08.403
I'm Detective Wong.

08:08.454 --> 08:09.570
Thank you
for helping out today.

08:09.621 --> 08:11.689
It's not a problem.

08:11.707 --> 08:13.458
When did you arrive
in Hong Kong?

08:13.492 --> 08:14.625
Uh, this morning.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.327
- Oh, from the U.S.?
- Mm-hmm.

08:16.361 --> 08:18.830
You must be jet-lagged.

08:18.864 --> 08:20.581
Where are you staying here
in Hong Kong?

08:20.632 --> 08:24.051
Um, I got a place
on Airbnb.

08:26.054 --> 08:28.205
Why were you
at mid-level?

08:28.223 --> 08:29.974
I wasn't able
to check in yet,

08:30.008 --> 08:32.643
and so I was just killing
a few hours.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.010
I went to see
the Man Mo Temple.

08:34.044 --> 08:35.730
Ah, well, sorry
to put a damper

08:35.764 --> 08:37.047
on your sightseeing plans.

08:37.065 --> 08:41.402
We'll get you out of here
as soon as we can.

08:47.726 --> 08:49.193
Well, this is certainly
out of the blue.

08:49.227 --> 08:50.912
I've been squeezing
the Attorney General for it,

08:50.946 --> 08:52.413
but I didn't want to get
your hopes up.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.915
I-I didn't ask
for a plea deal.

08:53.949 --> 08:55.450
Look, Arthur.

08:55.501 --> 08:58.369
It's my responsibility
to make sure you have options.

08:58.403 --> 09:00.121
This is a guilty plea
and a jail sentence.

09:00.172 --> 09:02.590
But no murder
and no treason charges.

09:02.624 --> 09:03.741
I'm not guilty.

09:03.759 --> 09:06.243
We both know
that doesn't matter.

09:06.261 --> 09:07.628
Teo committed major crimes,

09:07.679 --> 09:08.629
and you're gonna take
the fall.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.381
Teo was a patriot
and a hero.

09:10.415 --> 09:12.683
You missed out
on raising one child.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.519
Do you really want to lose
your second chance?

09:14.553 --> 09:16.420
How am I gonna do that
from a jail cell?

09:16.438 --> 09:19.106
You sign this
and you get eight to ten, tops.

09:19.141 --> 09:22.259
You lose in court,
and you could go away for life.

09:22.277 --> 09:23.728
DOJ's got
an airtight case.

09:23.762 --> 09:26.364
- What if they don't?
- This is what I mean.

09:26.398 --> 09:28.449
You need to listen
to reason.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.601
Henry Wilcox is responsible,

09:30.619 --> 09:34.772
and we're close
to proving it.

09:34.790 --> 09:38.459
How?
With what evidence?

09:38.494 --> 09:40.945
If you have something
that can prove Henry's guilt,

09:40.963 --> 09:42.497
I strongly suggest
you share it with me

09:42.548 --> 09:43.948
so I can use it
to our advantage.

09:43.966 --> 09:45.750
You asked me to admit
to something I didn't do.

09:45.784 --> 09:49.453
You funded Teo and his
terrorist activities for years.

09:49.471 --> 09:52.957
There are bank statements,
trails to your pension.

09:52.975 --> 09:54.559
You even used Auggie Anderson
to set up

09:54.593 --> 09:57.728
accounts for him
in Colombia.

09:59.731 --> 10:02.183
Look, Arthur.

10:02.234 --> 10:04.969
This is
your only way out.

10:04.987 --> 10:07.989
- Hm.
- Take it.

10:08.023 --> 10:09.857
Do it
for your family.

10:09.908 --> 10:12.577
I implore you.

10:15.781 --> 10:16.781
Do you have
any other angles?

10:16.815 --> 10:18.148
This is all
we have.

10:18.166 --> 10:19.417
Should we slow
it down?

10:19.451 --> 10:23.671
Please, there are so many
people on the escalator.

10:28.994 --> 10:30.344
Stop.

10:30.379 --> 10:33.497
That's him with the man
who died.

10:36.835 --> 10:39.837
Wait here.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.528
Calder, she's got him.

11:08.700 --> 11:09.667
Do you have any way
to run this

11:09.701 --> 11:10.801
through the database
at Langley?

11:10.836 --> 11:14.589
Already sent it
to Joan.

11:33.241 --> 11:34.609
Running it through now.

11:34.660 --> 11:36.277
How did you get this?
And where's Annie?

11:36.328 --> 11:38.195
She's at a Hong Kong
police precinct.

11:38.229 --> 11:40.665
She improvised once the courier
was taken off the board.

11:40.699 --> 11:44.401
She got HKPF to show her
security cam footage.

11:44.419 --> 11:47.371
I've got a match,
but we've got a problem.

11:47.405 --> 11:48.456
The man who took
the diamonds

11:48.507 --> 11:50.341
from the courier
is Oliver Li.

11:50.375 --> 11:54.545
He's MSS, fourth in command
at the Third Bureau.

11:54.579 --> 11:56.631
Henry's working
with the Chinese spy service?

11:56.682 --> 11:58.749
Soon as Hong Kong police
realize she's I.D.ed

11:58.767 --> 12:00.635
an MSS agent,
they'll never let her go.

12:00.686 --> 12:02.353
She's gotta get out
of there, Auggie.

12:02.387 --> 12:06.307
We're on it.

12:45.989 --> 12:47.623
Good afternoon.

12:47.657 --> 12:49.792
Miss...

12:49.826 --> 12:51.443
I'm glad you're here.

12:51.461 --> 12:55.047
It saved me having
to track you down myself.

12:55.081 --> 12:56.916
And why would you
come looking for me?

12:56.950 --> 12:58.116
I have a picture
that I thought

12:58.135 --> 13:02.004
might be of interest
to you.

13:04.558 --> 13:08.460
I thought maybe you'd want to
handle the situation yourself.

13:15.235 --> 13:17.186
I want Henry Wilcox.

13:17.237 --> 13:18.437
You help me bring him
to U.S. soil,

13:18.471 --> 13:22.241
and you can have all
the diamonds for yourself.

13:22.275 --> 13:25.978
Hush, hush.

13:36.790 --> 13:38.674
It's been ten minutes
since we texted her.

13:38.708 --> 13:40.209
If she's not out
in two minutes more,

13:40.260 --> 13:42.711
I'm going in
after her.

13:42.762 --> 13:46.348
Come on.

13:52.022 --> 13:53.689
Guys, meet Oliver Li.

13:53.723 --> 13:56.842
He's coming with us.

14:04.517 --> 14:06.619
Let me guess:
Oliver didn't want his friends

14:06.653 --> 14:09.572
at MSS finding out
he made a side deal with Henry.

14:09.623 --> 14:11.907
And his friends
are not exactly friendly,

14:11.958 --> 14:13.993
so he's making a new deal
with us.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.411
He's gonna help us
catch Henry,

14:15.462 --> 14:16.695
we're gonna keep that picture
of him

14:16.713 --> 14:18.914
taking the briefcase
to ourselves,

14:18.965 --> 14:21.217
and he gets to keep
all of Henry's diamonds.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.968
This isn't necessary.

14:23.003 --> 14:24.643
You have the leverage
you need against me.

14:24.671 --> 14:26.255
I'm not going anywhere.

14:26.306 --> 14:27.840
You're still a spy.

14:27.874 --> 14:31.393
If the roles were reversed,
would you trust me?

14:31.428 --> 14:33.378
No.

14:33.396 --> 14:35.014
There was close
to $200 million

14:35.048 --> 14:36.932
on those stolen pallets.

14:36.983 --> 14:38.851
What was your take gonna be?
10, 15 mil?

14:38.885 --> 14:40.853
Try 30.

14:40.887 --> 14:44.189
You help us catch Henry,
you get to keep it all.

14:44.223 --> 14:46.025
I'm guessing $200 million

14:46.059 --> 14:48.360
means more to you
than the motherland.

14:48.394 --> 14:51.396
What can I say?
I'm a capitalist at heart.

14:51.414 --> 14:55.584
Pleasure doing business
with you, Oliver.

15:10.850 --> 15:15.054
Take a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

15:24.281 --> 15:27.283
You are
the entire team?

15:30.904 --> 15:32.905
Looks like the CIA
greatly underestimates

15:32.939 --> 15:34.606
how dangerous Henry Wilcox
actually is.

15:34.624 --> 15:36.608
If anyone has
a healthy understanding

15:36.626 --> 15:38.294
of what Henry can do,
it's us.

15:38.328 --> 15:41.613
Henry will be ready
for war,

15:41.631 --> 15:44.550
and you don't
have backup.

15:44.584 --> 15:47.252
You're going to fail.

15:47.286 --> 15:48.337
Look, pal.

15:48.388 --> 15:49.888
You better do everything
in your power

15:49.923 --> 15:52.975
to make sure
we don't fail,

15:53.009 --> 15:55.060
or you're taking
the first bullet.

15:55.095 --> 15:56.962
Hear me?

15:56.980 --> 15:59.982
Can I talk to you?

16:04.771 --> 16:06.805
We need him to trust us.

16:06.823 --> 16:08.190
The money's enough incentive.

16:08.241 --> 16:10.576
200 million
stolen CIA dollars.

16:10.610 --> 16:12.695
In untraceable diamonds
that he already has

16:12.746 --> 16:14.830
in his possession,
which we will never see

16:14.864 --> 16:16.448
no matter what happens.

16:16.482 --> 16:19.651
You want to go all in
with a Chinese spy?

16:19.669 --> 16:24.173
What if he doesn't lead us
to Henry?

16:42.175 --> 16:44.509
Call Henry.

16:44.527 --> 16:47.529
Schedule a meet
somewhere public.

16:54.287 --> 16:55.454
Hey.

16:55.488 --> 16:57.156
I came home
as soon as I could.

16:57.190 --> 16:58.690
Things are moving quickly
in Hong Kong.

16:58.708 --> 17:00.125
They're closing in
on Henry.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.828
- I think we are too.
- What's going on?

17:02.862 --> 17:04.246
Well, it's my turn
to tell you something

17:04.297 --> 17:05.457
I couldn't say
over the phone.

17:05.464 --> 17:07.800
Bianca came by,

17:07.834 --> 17:09.752
and she brought me
a plea deal.

17:09.803 --> 17:10.919
You didn't sign it,
did you?

17:10.970 --> 17:12.087
No, of course not.

17:12.137 --> 17:13.722
Did you ever mention
to Bianca

17:13.757 --> 17:15.223
that I sent Auggie
to Medellin

17:15.258 --> 17:16.759
to open that bank account
for Teo?

17:16.810 --> 17:18.060
What? No.

17:18.094 --> 17:20.929
We agreed to keep Annie
and Auggie out of the testimony.

17:20.980 --> 17:22.263
Well, while she was
laying out

17:22.315 --> 17:23.432
the litany of proof
against me,

17:23.483 --> 17:24.733
she specifically referenced

17:24.768 --> 17:26.902
that I sent him
to Colombia,

17:26.935 --> 17:29.488
but it is nowhere
in any of these depositions.

17:29.522 --> 17:31.056
She actually mentioned Auggie
by name?

17:31.074 --> 17:32.891
I never even told her
I sent an operative down there.

17:32.909 --> 17:35.861
I said I set up
the account myself.

17:35.895 --> 17:38.197
So how did she know?

17:38.231 --> 17:40.271
The only other person who knew
about that was Annie,

17:40.283 --> 17:41.533
and she found out from--

17:41.567 --> 17:43.919
Henry.

17:43.953 --> 17:45.003
Bianca slipped up.

17:45.038 --> 17:48.090
Oh, my God.

17:48.124 --> 17:49.875
Bianca might just be
the smoking gun

17:49.909 --> 17:52.761
we can use
against him.

17:58.635 --> 18:01.804
What does Henry Wilcox
have on you?

18:01.855 --> 18:04.306
Now why would I tell you
something like that,

18:04.357 --> 18:08.060
especially after you gave me
a better way out?

18:10.063 --> 18:13.282
As long
as you deliver Henry.

18:15.735 --> 18:16.702
What are you gonna do
with the money?

18:16.736 --> 18:21.606
Are you gonna stay
in Hong Kong?

18:21.624 --> 18:24.626
I'm up for early pension
in six months,

18:24.661 --> 18:28.113
so I can't leave
before then.

18:28.131 --> 18:29.548
Why?

18:29.582 --> 18:30.966
You don't need
the pension now.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.002
The ministry
would get suspicious.

18:34.053 --> 18:35.888
But yes,
the day I resign

18:35.922 --> 18:38.123
is the day I disappear
with all

18:38.141 --> 18:41.426
of Henry Wilcox's
hard-earned fortune.

18:43.296 --> 18:47.966
You don't like being
a spy?

18:47.984 --> 18:51.303
You and I,

18:51.321 --> 18:54.273
we put our lives
on the line,

18:54.307 --> 18:57.943
but it's just a game.

18:57.977 --> 18:59.027
I realized
a long time ago

18:59.078 --> 19:00.812
that the only way
you can win the game

19:00.830 --> 19:04.149
is by getting out.

19:04.167 --> 19:05.284
Hey, Walker.

19:05.318 --> 19:08.871
We got eight hours
till the meet.

19:08.922 --> 19:11.924
My shift now.
Go grab some downtime.

19:23.386 --> 19:25.387
Mingus?

19:25.438 --> 19:29.191
Better than small talk
with Calder.

19:29.225 --> 19:30.559
How about small talk
with me?

19:30.610 --> 19:32.394
Eh.

19:32.445 --> 19:36.782
Nothing you and I have
to talk about is small.

19:36.816 --> 19:38.626
I know.

19:40.987 --> 19:45.707
I'm kind of hungry.
You wanna grab a bite?

19:45.742 --> 19:48.744
Sure.

20:42.748 --> 20:43.715
You said
you were hungry,

20:43.749 --> 20:47.585
but I don't hear
any slurping.

20:47.604 --> 20:51.106
I guess I got used
to eating alone.

20:57.763 --> 20:58.763
I'm sorry,
I know this hasn't

20:58.781 --> 21:01.867
been easy
for you either.

21:01.901 --> 21:05.120
At least now I'm not worried
about where you are,

21:05.154 --> 21:08.206
or if you are.

21:12.795 --> 21:14.413
Sometimes I don't remember
what life was like

21:14.447 --> 21:16.114
before I went dark.

21:26.676 --> 21:29.978
Annie, that's what it feels
like when you're at war.

21:35.818 --> 21:38.236
Everything we lost,
everything he put us through,

21:38.271 --> 21:40.989
in eight hours,
it'll be over.

21:41.024 --> 21:44.142
Either we get Henry,
or we die trying.

21:48.247 --> 21:51.249
We're gonna get him.

21:53.536 --> 21:56.538
And then,
we're goin' home.

22:13.886 --> 22:14.936
Two minutes to showtime.

22:14.970 --> 22:18.556
You know
your dance steps?

22:18.607 --> 22:20.275
Get on the tram
with Henry.

22:20.309 --> 22:22.677
You get in the front car.
I'll be in the back.

22:22.695 --> 22:24.112
Get off halfway
up the hill,

22:24.146 --> 22:25.230
MacDonnell Road.

22:25.281 --> 22:26.531
We'll park
next to the stop.

22:26.565 --> 22:29.150
You just get Henry as close
to this van as possible.

22:29.184 --> 22:30.568
Annie will be following
from a distance.

22:30.619 --> 22:32.704
Once he's in position,
she'll force him in from behind.

22:32.738 --> 22:34.289
You sure I shouldn't be
the one doing the follow?

22:34.323 --> 22:36.374
If Henry spots Annie,
this whole thing is over.

22:36.408 --> 22:37.625
If I didn't know
how to follow someone

22:37.660 --> 22:39.077
without being noticed,
I would've been dead

22:39.128 --> 22:41.045
a long time ago.

22:41.080 --> 22:45.583
Check his wire?

22:45.634 --> 22:47.085
All right, Oliver,
give me a sound check.

22:49.889 --> 22:51.339
What'd you just say?

22:51.373 --> 22:53.391
He said, "good luck.
It's gonna be great."

22:53.425 --> 22:58.379
It's workin'.

22:58.397 --> 23:00.732
Looks like he's here.
Let's do this.

23:00.766 --> 23:02.183
You ready?

23:02.217 --> 23:04.235
Don't worry about me.

23:04.270 --> 23:06.488
Just keep up your end.

23:06.522 --> 23:10.358
I'll be right behind you.

23:12.077 --> 23:15.163
Annie.

23:15.197 --> 23:16.781
You ready?

23:16.832 --> 23:17.832
You know, I've never been
more ready

23:17.867 --> 23:21.569
for anything in my life.

23:33.048 --> 23:34.516
Yeah?

23:34.550 --> 23:36.584
You asked for Michaels
and Anderson's whereabouts.

23:36.602 --> 23:37.602
I think
I might have them.

23:37.636 --> 23:39.604
One of our jets took off
from Dix Field

23:39.638 --> 23:41.923
in Linwood, New Jersey
almost 48 hours ago,

23:41.941 --> 23:44.225
destination unknown.

23:44.259 --> 23:45.760
I pinged the transponder.

23:45.778 --> 23:48.279
Says it's now
in Hong Kong.

23:48.314 --> 23:50.097
Auggie and Calder
are here?

23:50.115 --> 23:53.201
I think so.

23:55.621 --> 23:58.406
Thank you, Eric.

24:15.925 --> 24:18.142
Thanks for meeting me
on such short notice.

24:18.177 --> 24:21.563
Your call concerned me.
I wasn't expecting any hiccups.

24:21.597 --> 24:24.131
I wasn't expecting your man
to be hit by a car.

24:24.149 --> 24:27.151
Let's take a ride.

25:08.978 --> 25:11.312
Listen up.
We've got eyes on the tram.

25:11.346 --> 25:12.981
Soon as they get off,
be in position

25:13.015 --> 25:17.869
to force Henry
into the van.

25:17.903 --> 25:20.822
Let's get off here
so we can talk privately.

25:20.856 --> 25:25.192
No, no,
let's go to the summit.

25:25.210 --> 25:29.631
Enjoy the view.

25:31.583 --> 25:33.835
Henry, I'm not here
to take in the sights.

25:33.869 --> 25:36.754
I took care of your dead courier
at great personal expense.

25:36.805 --> 25:39.974
I need your assurances
that that will not happen again.

25:40.009 --> 25:44.012
At the top,
there'll be safety in numbers.

25:55.491 --> 25:58.276
They didn't get off
the tram.

25:58.327 --> 25:59.861
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

25:59.895 --> 26:01.055
Grabbing Henry
at the summit's

26:01.063 --> 26:02.330
gonna be a lot harder.

26:02.364 --> 26:05.533
You have two minutes.

27:04.309 --> 27:05.960
I love Victoria Peak.

27:05.978 --> 27:09.013
The view
is so relaxing.

27:09.064 --> 27:12.150
It helps me
to think more clearly.

27:12.184 --> 27:16.237
And one of your Chinese
proverbs comes to mind.

27:16.271 --> 27:18.639
You must know it.

27:18.657 --> 27:21.308
"Fortune does
not come twice.

27:21.326 --> 27:25.363
Misfortune does
not come alone."

27:25.414 --> 27:27.331
You profited immensely

27:27.366 --> 27:29.867
from the chopper strike
in Copenhagen.

27:29.918 --> 27:31.252
As did you.

27:31.286 --> 27:33.704
And it never
would've happened

27:33.756 --> 27:36.874
if I hadn't planned
every last detail

27:36.925 --> 27:38.126
for you, would it?

27:38.160 --> 27:40.678
You get Henry,
I'll get the car.

27:40.712 --> 27:41.996
I owe you
nothing, Henry.

27:42.014 --> 27:46.000
But you do.
An explanation.

27:46.018 --> 27:49.503
I thought we were
in this together.

27:49.521 --> 27:51.856
I trusted you
with my money.

27:51.890 --> 27:54.976
And then, in repayment,

27:55.010 --> 27:57.845
you lured me
into a trap?

28:03.518 --> 28:06.120
Don't be
so surprised, Oliver.

28:06.155 --> 28:08.706
We are both
spies, remember?

28:11.243 --> 28:14.078
I didn't think you'd be
completely honest with me.

28:14.129 --> 28:18.966
You shouldn't think I'd be
completely honest with you.

28:19.001 --> 28:20.635
Auggie, you've got company.

28:20.669 --> 28:23.137
Open your door
as hard as you can

28:23.172 --> 28:24.138
when I tell you.

28:24.173 --> 28:25.223
Ready?

28:25.257 --> 28:27.541
Three,

28:27.559 --> 28:29.310
two,

28:29.344 --> 28:30.311
one.

28:52.400 --> 28:56.737
I got Li.
I got Li.

29:00.425 --> 29:03.845
Freeze!

29:09.218 --> 29:10.685
Guys, come on.

29:37.350 --> 29:39.285
Henry's guys
were waitin' for us.

29:39.319 --> 29:40.536
How the hell'd he know
we were here?

29:40.571 --> 29:41.692
Oliver must've signaled him.

29:41.705 --> 29:43.656
Why?

29:43.690 --> 29:45.792
So he can kill me too?

29:45.826 --> 29:47.359
I told you you'd fail.

29:47.377 --> 29:48.360
Look, can we just
figure out

29:48.378 --> 29:49.862
how we are gonna
follow Henry?

29:49.880 --> 29:51.481
He is getting farther away
by the minute.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.032
In case you weren't
paying attention,

29:53.050 --> 29:54.033
we are blown here.

29:54.051 --> 29:55.418
Our only advantage
was Henry

29:55.469 --> 29:56.535
not knowing
we were coming.

29:56.553 --> 29:58.004
Henry doesn't know
I'm alive.

29:58.038 --> 29:59.472
You do not know that.

29:59.506 --> 30:01.207
Look, we came here
to get Henry,

30:01.225 --> 30:03.309
and that is exactly
what we are gonna do.

30:03.343 --> 30:04.560
But we don't need
him anymore.

30:04.595 --> 30:07.563
We have Oliver.

30:07.598 --> 30:09.098
We're gonna
take him back.

30:09.149 --> 30:11.067
He's gonna testify
about Copenhagen.

30:11.101 --> 30:12.384
That wasn't the deal
we made.

30:12.402 --> 30:15.387
The deal has changed.

30:16.406 --> 30:17.607
And you think MSS

30:17.658 --> 30:20.109
will let me leave
with you?

30:20.160 --> 30:22.195
They'll kill all of us
before they do that.

30:22.229 --> 30:25.081
Yeah, well, that's just a risk
we're gonna have to take.

30:25.115 --> 30:27.166
All right, he is our best bet
right now.

30:27.201 --> 30:28.901
Arthur will be exonerated,

30:28.919 --> 30:31.570
and you can finally
come back home.

30:31.588 --> 30:34.006
I can't go home
without Henry.

30:34.041 --> 30:37.576
You can't,
or you won't?

30:37.594 --> 30:38.845
I mean, come on, Annie.

30:38.879 --> 30:41.714
This could be your last chance
to get back.

30:41.748 --> 30:43.382
Do you really want
to give that up?

30:43.416 --> 30:46.435
The idea of leaving here
without Henry

30:46.470 --> 30:48.087
turns my stomach,

30:48.105 --> 30:49.806
but I would rather
leave now

30:49.857 --> 30:51.941
with a chance
to make things right

30:51.975 --> 30:53.759
than not be able
to leave at all.

30:53.777 --> 30:55.945
If we leave without Henry,
he wins.

30:55.979 --> 30:57.446
He goes unpunished.

30:57.481 --> 31:00.900
Annie, Henry forced you
into this game,

31:00.934 --> 31:03.820
but you get to decide
what you're playing for.

31:03.871 --> 31:05.037
And you better
decide fast

31:05.072 --> 31:06.605
because our window
to get off this island

31:06.623 --> 31:09.625
is closing by the minute.

31:24.124 --> 31:25.624
Bianca.

31:25.642 --> 31:28.678
Arthur.

31:31.815 --> 31:35.651
I knew you'd change
your mind.

31:35.686 --> 31:37.069
How much has
he been paying you

31:37.104 --> 31:39.138
to tank my case?

31:39.156 --> 31:40.273
Who?

31:40.307 --> 31:43.159
Henry Wilcox.

31:43.193 --> 31:44.977
That's
an outrageous accusation.

31:44.995 --> 31:48.314
I never told you
that I sent Auggie to Medellin.

31:48.332 --> 31:51.701
Neither did Joan.

31:51.752 --> 31:53.547
Henry was the only other person
that knew.

31:56.673 --> 31:58.457
So when did he first
contact you?

31:58.491 --> 32:01.660
About a week after
you returned from Germany.

32:01.678 --> 32:04.013
Tell me
what you know, Bianca.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.766
You can either tell me
right now,

32:06.800 --> 32:08.134
or you can tell
the Attorney General.

32:08.168 --> 32:09.268
I'm sorry, Arthur.

32:09.303 --> 32:11.089
I can't.

33:57.995 --> 33:59.111
Joan.

34:05.135 --> 34:07.553
Come on, pick up.

34:24.654 --> 34:25.737
Joan?

34:25.772 --> 34:28.806
Honey, can
you hear me?

34:28.824 --> 34:30.909
Get out of the house
now, okay?

34:30.944 --> 34:32.610
Right now.

34:32.645 --> 34:35.647
Now.
They're coming.

35:54.778 --> 35:56.278
Joan, we've got
Oliver Li,

35:56.329 --> 35:58.831
and we're headed
to the plane now.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.032
Oh, my God.

36:00.066 --> 36:04.670
Uh, are you both okay?

36:04.704 --> 36:06.738
Okay, well, uh,

36:06.756 --> 36:07.906
you take care
of each other,

36:07.924 --> 36:11.460
and--and we'll take care
of things here.

36:11.511 --> 36:13.078
Well, what is it?
What's going on?

36:13.096 --> 36:17.016
Henry put a hit out
on Arthur and Joan.

36:17.050 --> 36:18.017
Joan's okay.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.101
Arthur's been stabbed,

36:19.136 --> 36:20.686
and they're operating
on him now.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.921
That son of a bitch.

36:22.939 --> 36:25.724
Think we got a problem
of our own.

36:25.758 --> 36:30.095
They found us.

36:43.162 --> 36:45.830
How'd they find us
so quickly?

36:45.864 --> 36:47.915
Hold your line
and let 'em grow on us.

36:47.950 --> 36:52.003
Wrap your arms around me,
and hold on tight.

37:02.764 --> 37:05.132
Nice shot.

37:05.166 --> 37:06.884
I'm guessing
we lost them.

37:06.935 --> 37:08.553
Yeah, for now.

37:08.604 --> 37:13.140
If they found us once,
they can find us again.

37:15.727 --> 37:18.396
Can I get
a cigarette, please?

37:18.447 --> 37:20.147
You took them yesterday

37:20.181 --> 37:23.317
with my wallet
and my phone.

37:24.403 --> 37:25.570
Oliver's phone.

37:25.621 --> 37:26.954
That's how
they're tracking us.

37:26.989 --> 37:28.239
Get rid
of 'em now.

37:28.290 --> 37:29.523
Wait.
I can take the phone.

37:29.541 --> 37:31.358
I can use the phone
to get Henry's men

37:31.376 --> 37:32.460
to follow us
to the ferry.

37:32.494 --> 37:33.461
That'll buy you
enough time

37:33.495 --> 37:35.246
to get back
to the plane.

37:35.297 --> 37:38.416
I'll loop around
and meet you there.

37:38.467 --> 37:39.717
I think I've finally learned
not to try

37:39.751 --> 37:41.552
to stop you
when your mind's made up.

37:41.587 --> 37:42.803
Thank you, Calder.

37:42.838 --> 37:46.507
We'll meet you
on the tarmac.

37:57.218 --> 37:58.319
Annie.

37:58.353 --> 37:59.654
Auggie, I have
to do this.

37:59.688 --> 38:03.491
I was just gonna say
good luck.

38:03.525 --> 38:06.661
Thanks.

38:06.695 --> 38:09.697
Go.

38:27.933 --> 38:29.967
- Mrs. Campbell?
- Yes?

38:30.018 --> 38:31.886
I'm Dr. Adams, part
of your husband's surgical team.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.587
- How is he?
- He's doing well.

38:33.605 --> 38:34.588
He's asking for you
in recovery.

38:34.606 --> 38:35.589
I can take you
to see him now.

38:35.607 --> 38:38.943
Thank God.

38:40.946 --> 38:43.397
Arthur.

38:43.431 --> 38:46.484
In that moment,

38:46.535 --> 38:49.370
all I could think of

38:49.404 --> 38:52.373
was you.

38:55.327 --> 38:58.829
The thought
of not seeing you.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.948
I'm here now.

39:00.966 --> 39:03.951
We're here now.

39:19.351 --> 39:20.935
Come on,
the jet's already warming up.

39:20.969 --> 39:22.903
We're not goin' anywhere
without Annie.

39:22.938 --> 39:25.740
We're not gonna
leave her behind.

39:25.774 --> 39:28.776
Let's go, we'll wait for her
on the plane, Auggie.

39:57.055 --> 39:58.172
Annie.

39:58.190 --> 40:00.057
Auggie, did you make it
to the plane?

40:00.108 --> 40:01.809
Oliver's on board
with Calder.

40:01.843 --> 40:04.562
They should be safely out of
Chinese airspace in minutes.

40:04.613 --> 40:06.864
Then where are you?

40:06.898 --> 40:09.150
There's no way
I'm leaving,

40:09.184 --> 40:10.684
not without you.

40:10.702 --> 40:13.954
Auggie, I didn't stay
to try and catch him.

40:13.989 --> 40:14.955
I have
a different plan now.

40:14.990 --> 40:16.574
You know that, right?

40:16.625 --> 40:18.859
You know
I'm with you

40:18.877 --> 40:20.694
no matter
how this thing ends.

40:20.712 --> 40:23.748
Just tell me
what you need me to do.

40:28.703 --> 40:30.471
Auggie...

40:30.505 --> 40:32.873
I gotta go.

40:45.854 --> 40:47.521
Hey.

40:47.555 --> 40:51.659
You lookin' for this?

40:51.693 --> 40:55.329
Hold her!

41:04.122 --> 41:07.574
Oh, my God.

41:17.302 --> 41:19.637
Hello, Miss Walker.
