00:18.219 --> 00:20.188
Corpsman!

00:21.389 --> 00:23.724
It's open.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.660
Hello! Paramedics!

00:26.694 --> 00:28.596
Corpsman

00:29.697 --> 00:31.599
It's out.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.334
Unit 207 to dispatch.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.236
Arrived at the residence,
no response.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.537
Searching the premises now.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.672
DISPATCH:
Copy that, 207.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.374
Take the stairs,
I'll search down here.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.575
Why do I got to take
the stairs?

00:41.609 --> 00:43.077
Because I gave
mouth-to-mouth to the guy

00:43.111 --> 00:44.845
pushing 300 at the last call.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.647
I'm still trying
to catch my breath.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.516
Really?
Come on.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.486
Hello?

00:52.520 --> 00:54.522
Paramedics!

00:56.390 --> 00:58.392
Corpsman

01:04.298 --> 01:06.334
Nothing here.
How you looking?

01:06.367 --> 01:08.302
Corpsman?

01:09.703 --> 01:11.705
Mott?

01:13.707 --> 01:17.245
Look, if you try and spook me,

01:17.278 --> 01:19.513
I swear I'm gonna kick your ass.

01:24.352 --> 01:25.653
Seriously, Mott.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.155
Stop playing.

01:36.397 --> 01:39.167
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:39.200 --> 01:41.602
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:41.635 --> 01:44.205
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:44.238 --> 01:45.373
* How, how, how, how

01:45.406 --> 01:47.741
* Hey, hey

01:53.514 --> 01:55.183
* You gotta come on.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.355
WOMAN: Meredith!

02:01.389 --> 02:04.592
Hi.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.759
Mom.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.696
I like this hair.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.332
This is much better than
that boy cut, don't you think?

02:11.365 --> 02:12.900
Good to see you, too, Mom.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.302
Yeah, I thought I told you

02:14.335 --> 02:15.603
that I didn't need
you to pick me up.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.770
And I thought I told you

02:16.804 --> 02:18.272
I wanted to welcome you
to the city.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.341
Well, you know, it's
a work trip, so.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.775
You still haven't said
why you're in town.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.445
Hovercraft conference?

02:24.478 --> 02:27.715
Invisibility cloak expo?

02:27.748 --> 02:29.583
Oh, so close,

02:29.617 --> 02:32.186
but, you know, I don't
work for Hogwarts anymore.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.454
I work for DARPA,

02:33.487 --> 02:34.722
and pretty much everything
I do is, you know...

02:34.755 --> 02:36.457
Compartmented, yes.
No work.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.260
So, just to get small talk
out of the way: let's see,

02:39.293 --> 02:41.929
your dad is, uh,
on a low salt diet,

02:41.962 --> 02:43.897
your aunt's
become a lesbian,

02:43.931 --> 02:45.833
and the dog is
eating his own poop.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.368
Hello.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.769
I have baggage.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.671
Yes, we do.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.512
I know you're probably swamped
with meetings, so I just,

02:58.546 --> 03:00.648
I wanted to make sure I had
a chance to talk to you.

03:00.681 --> 03:04.552
A couple months ago I started
receiving these pictures.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.487
Is that supposed to be you?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.522
Where did these come from?

03:08.556 --> 03:10.458
Oh.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.393
They've been altered in...

03:12.426 --> 03:15.396
in a really disturbing way.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.930
Emily was removed.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.499
I was Photoshopped in.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.301
I bet it was
that Michael Chippino kid

03:20.334 --> 03:21.502
that used to date both of you.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.305
I mean, come on,
who dates twins?

03:24.338 --> 03:27.708
Some kind of crazy fetish
thing going on there.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.410
Mom, a colleague and I
started doing some digging,

03:29.443 --> 03:31.011
and long story short,

03:31.044 --> 03:32.946
these photos led me
to an IP address,

03:32.980 --> 03:35.549
which was this Web site.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.017
Murder conspiracies.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.786
Emily was on it.
Huh.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.721
You know I've always thought

03:40.754 --> 03:43.957
her death was more than
a drunk driver accident.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.460
Apparently
you're not the only one.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.729
Oh, good, that's mine.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.465
Let's go.

03:55.469 --> 03:58.739
Listen, darling, I-I
understand how this stuff

03:58.772 --> 04:01.342
might be upsetting,

04:01.375 --> 04:03.411
but it-it seems
to me, it's just,

04:03.444 --> 04:05.479
like, half-baked
speculation, really.

04:05.513 --> 04:06.947
I mean, there's
no proof here.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.582
There's nothing that
can be documented,

04:08.616 --> 04:10.318
corroborated
and confirmed.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.652
Mom, someone wants me
to see this.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.521
Question is who?

04:14.988 --> 04:16.557
It's work.
Okay, got to go,

04:16.590 --> 04:18.526
but we can discuss this
in the car on the way.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.561
No need, darling,
I ordered a car.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.498
Lunch tomorrow.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.800
You never intended
on driving with me, did you?

04:28.669 --> 04:31.339
LASALLE:
Pair of vics.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.641
Hospital Corpsman Second Class,
Petty Officer, Aleah Baldwin

04:33.674 --> 04:36.977
and Hospital Corpsman
First Class, Wesley Mott

04:37.010 --> 04:39.547
both went unresponsive
over comms.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.015
Naval Branch Health
Clinic called

04:42.049 --> 04:43.384
NOPD to investigate.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.085
So NOPD found the bodies.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.087
We got Mott's ambulance run log

04:47.120 --> 04:48.556
off the vehicle.

04:48.589 --> 04:51.058
Says they were responding
to a cardiac arrest.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.526
We got anything
on the home owners?

04:52.560 --> 04:54.362
Tenant's been stationed
at Jacksonville

04:54.395 --> 04:55.563
for three months.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.296
Who made the call?

04:56.330 --> 04:57.765
So when you have
a heart attack,

04:57.798 --> 04:59.567
you usually call 911, right?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.435
Mm-hmm.
Well, whoever
placed this call,

05:01.469 --> 05:03.637
dialed straight
into the clinic.

05:03.671 --> 05:06.607
Somebody wanted NBHC
to send first responders.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.977
And the only people on duty,
Mott and Baldwin.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.617
What do we got, Loretta?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.686
Ah, the male corpsman, Mott...

05:20.521 --> 05:22.356
...was shot in the back
of the head,

05:22.390 --> 05:23.857
and the size of the contact burn

05:23.891 --> 05:26.660
suggests he was shot
from close range.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.630
So our killer likely
caught Mott by surprise,

05:29.663 --> 05:30.898
shot him from behind.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.835
And, but unlike Mott,
Baldwin here...

05:36.704 --> 05:38.539
...took a bullet
from the front.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.774
Shooter took out one,

05:40.808 --> 05:44.011
from back here,

05:44.044 --> 05:45.713
and then...

05:45.746 --> 05:47.681
waits for the other one
to enter and...

05:47.715 --> 05:49.016
Bang.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.418
Think I may have motive here.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.652
It's just a theory, but look,

05:51.685 --> 05:53.487
Baldwin's body over there,

05:53.521 --> 05:54.688
totally undisturbed.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.457
Check this out.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.760
Notice anything missing?

06:07.501 --> 06:08.902
Mott's CAC card's gone.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.905
Somebody yanked it.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.641
Lure two corpsman into a house,

06:13.674 --> 06:14.808
kill them,

06:14.842 --> 06:16.744
for their credentials?

06:18.946 --> 06:21.949
Answer me this:

06:21.982 --> 06:24.652
Mott's access card's
been used since the killing?

06:55.716 --> 06:57.885
(machine beeping rhythmically

07:00.153 --> 07:02.690
Okay, secured.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.191
Good to go.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.032
Guys all right back there?

07:24.945 --> 07:26.780
Christopher, tell me things.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.482
Two more sailors DOA.

07:28.516 --> 07:29.617
According to their C.O.,

07:29.650 --> 07:31.752
they was on a
classified transport

07:31.785 --> 07:32.953
from Ochsner Medical.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.755
Let me guess,

07:34.788 --> 07:37.758
killer used Mott's ID
for the pickup?

07:38.158 --> 07:39.560
Yep.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.628
Public street.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.195
There's got to be witnesses.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.864
Well, we got a
jogger over there

07:43.897 --> 07:45.232
said he saw a black,
four-door sedan

07:45.265 --> 07:47.067
driving away from the scene.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.869
Get me a make and model.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.470
Pride.

07:51.539 --> 07:52.673
You need to see this.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.112
Organ transplant.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.216
Shot through the heart.

08:03.250 --> 08:06.620
Whoa. Anybody else
thinking Bon Jovi?

08:07.220 --> 08:09.590
Not the time.

08:09.623 --> 08:10.658
Right.

08:10.691 --> 08:11.859
The heart.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.060
Who was it intended for?

08:17.765 --> 08:20.033
According to Navy Intel,
heart was meant

08:20.067 --> 08:23.671
for a civilian Navy Cryptologic
Technician, Max Pinzon.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.238
Pinzon was stationed
out of Virginia;

08:25.272 --> 08:27.140
transferred here a week ago
for a procedure.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.241
That's all we could get.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.877
The rest
is compartmented.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.813
Any word
on Pinzon's supervisor?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.048
Well, we were told we'd get
a civilian handler instead.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.184
And that would be me.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.752
Mom?

08:38.786 --> 08:41.188
I know. And like a bad penny,

08:41.221 --> 08:42.856
she just keeps showing up.

08:42.890 --> 08:43.757
I'm Olivia Brody,

08:43.791 --> 08:46.860
I'm Program Manager

08:46.894 --> 08:48.061
for Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.630
Some call it DARPA,

08:49.663 --> 08:51.732
as that is
a little easier to say.

08:51.765 --> 08:55.569
And I oversee NCT Pinzon's work.

08:55.603 --> 08:57.771
Agent Pride, I have heard
a lot about you.

08:57.805 --> 08:58.939
And I want to thank you

08:58.972 --> 09:00.741
for hiring my daughter.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.876
Oh, it's been an honor.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.311
You're slouching, darling.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.614
Let's walk and talk.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.115
This is mom?

09:08.148 --> 09:09.950
Not a word.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.185
Okay.

09:12.219 --> 09:16.824
I recruited Max
after our security personnel

09:16.857 --> 09:19.793
discovered that he had hacked
into our DARPA servers.

09:19.827 --> 09:20.661
Now he's writing code
for us.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.830
That's a lot of security
for a civilian.

09:22.863 --> 09:25.365
He's an irreplaceable
asset.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.800
And his condition?

09:26.834 --> 09:29.336
Congenital heart defect.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.043
Hello, Max.
Considering my surgery

09:36.076 --> 09:37.845
was scheduled in 33 minutes,

09:37.878 --> 09:39.346
and I've yet to receive
benzodiazepine,

09:39.379 --> 09:42.049
I take it they're not
my surgeons.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.817
Afraid not.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.786
So who are these stiffs?

09:45.819 --> 09:47.354
They're with NCIS.

09:48.956 --> 09:49.623
Agent Pride.

09:51.258 --> 09:54.227
You're heart...

09:54.261 --> 09:56.063
Compromised.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.402
We're gonna find
who did that.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.738
We're also gonna do
everything we can

10:04.772 --> 10:05.973
to get you another one.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.941
Don't bother.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.811
I'm HH blood group.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.245
Bombay blood group.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.918
Less than .0004%
of people have it,

10:17.951 --> 10:19.787
so the probability
of finding another donor heart

10:19.820 --> 10:23.791
is roughly 4,356,000 to one.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.928
Ergo: you're looking
at a dead man.

10:41.842 --> 10:42.876
We got four sailors dead,

10:42.910 --> 10:45.278
all because somebody wanted
to get to this kid.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.313
Tell me things.

10:46.346 --> 10:49.316
Max Pinzon, aka PinZ0.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.718
For those of you
keeping score at home,

10:50.751 --> 10:52.252
that's big "P," little "I,"

10:52.285 --> 10:54.387
little "N," big "Z,"
number zero.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.356
Millennials.
Yeah.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.926
Regardless of spelling,
PinZ0 was a foster kid,

10:58.959 --> 11:01.061
in and out of group homes
since the age of seven.

11:01.094 --> 11:04.064
IQ's off the charts,
though. 160.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.966
Same as Einstein
and Stephen Hawking.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.268
His heart condition was
discovered at age ten.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.237
Got his first computer
right after that.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.272
Six years later,
hacked into the DARPA servers.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.708
SONJA:
The agency caught him,
turned him.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.243
Turns out he's been working
with Mama Brody ever since.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.045
I had no clue.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.813
It's compartmented,
just like everything else

11:19.847 --> 11:22.750
in the Brody world.
SONJA:
Current diagnosis:

11:22.783 --> 11:24.985
Without the heart, the kid's
looking at three months.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.788
We got any leads?

11:27.821 --> 11:30.423
Given the size and
scope of the operation,

11:30.457 --> 11:33.761
talked to NSA, CIA and NCTC,
but there's no chatter.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.963
Whoever wanted him dead
couldn't get to the kid.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.065
So they got to his heart
instead.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.900
All right.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.302
Sonja, Chris, stay on medical.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.838
Find out everything
about the transplant.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.106
Brody, you're with me.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.908
We want know
who's trying

11:47.941 --> 11:50.377
to kill PinZ0,

11:50.410 --> 11:53.080
we need to know more
about what he was working on.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.050
I'm decrypting trace routes
to unmask the origins

11:57.084 --> 11:59.086
of unidentifiable
TOR transmissions.

12:02.289 --> 12:05.993
Dude's code is taking the "dark"
out of the Dark Web.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.995
All the perps buyin'
and sellin' weapons

12:08.028 --> 12:10.397
and drugs can now
be traced and ID'd.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.366
Blowing up most criminals'
primary means for doing badness.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.302
Whoa, whoa. Most of?

12:15.335 --> 12:19.206
This'll shut down 97.5%
of all online criminal activity.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.474
Well, I got it
at more like 96.3%,

12:21.508 --> 12:23.410
which is good,
but it's not 100%.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.846
Do you want me to show you how I
unmask randomly selected relays?

12:25.879 --> 12:27.080
Don't talk down to me, Rain Boy.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.849
So regardless of...

12:28.882 --> 12:31.184
whatever any of this means,

12:31.218 --> 12:35.889
the target of
Mr. PinZ0's work is...

12:35.923 --> 12:38.291
Disrupting terrorist
organizations.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.426
Right now,
we're targeting Boko Haram.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.094
Highly advanced.

12:41.128 --> 12:44.097
As are Jihadist Union,
ISIL and Libyan Brigade.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.133
Yes,
but for beta testing purposes,

12:46.166 --> 12:47.801
we're focused on Boko Haram.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.336
Still, they don't have
the kind of infrastructure

12:49.369 --> 12:51.271
in the States to pull
this kind of thing off.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.206
Just trying to help, darling.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.975
We appreciate that.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.443
But the question is--

12:56.476 --> 12:59.046
regardless of the who--

12:59.079 --> 13:01.815
how did they know
the heart was on the move?

13:03.483 --> 13:05.318
I'm gonna head back
to the squad room

13:05.352 --> 13:07.320
and go all Spider-Man
on the Dark Web.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.521
Pride...

13:08.555 --> 13:10.590
We followed the medical
bread crumbs.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.192
Turns out,
Hospital Corpsman Mott

13:12.225 --> 13:13.426
was scheduled to pick up
the transplant heart

13:13.460 --> 13:15.128
this morning
from Ochsner Medical.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.464
Somehow,
whoever killed him knew it.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.866
LASALLE:
Looked into the Navy angle.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.134
No breach,
but there is a middleman.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.369
Middlewoman.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.871
Janis Leary.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.505
She's the organ
transplant coordinator.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.541
She scheduled the pick up,
sent Mott the assignment.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.178
LASALLE:
And what's funky...
on day of the transport,

13:31.211 --> 13:32.479
she simultaneously logged
into the organ donor network

13:32.512 --> 13:34.081
in two different places.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.483
That's fishy.
Like big-ass tuna fishy.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.151
Her office is in Metairie.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.452
She's on call till 6:00 p.m.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.553
All right, Sonja,
you're with me.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.022
Get back
to the office.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.224
Start checking
out suspects.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.525
LEARY:
I guard that login

13:45.558 --> 13:47.928
with my life.
Sure you do,
but fact is,

13:47.961 --> 13:49.462
while you were logged in
in the office,

13:49.496 --> 13:50.931
somebody else was
using your identity

13:50.964 --> 13:52.265
from another
location.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.967
Yeah, who else might
know your password?

13:54.001 --> 13:55.635
Family member?
Friend?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.304
My ex-husband.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.571
Now, he's been
after me

13:58.605 --> 14:00.507
ever since I took Kiko back.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.474
Kiko?

14:06.013 --> 14:07.180
SONJA:
Yeah.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.916
Custody disputes can be ugly.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.350
So cute.

14:10.383 --> 14:13.120
While we follow up
on the husband angle,

14:13.153 --> 14:16.089
need you to think
a little harder on other leads.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.557
Well, there's no one else.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.559
I mean, I was assigned a unique
user name and password

14:19.592 --> 14:20.994
when I started working here.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.329
No one else knows it.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.931
Go back to the assigned part.

14:23.964 --> 14:24.932
Assigned by who?

14:24.965 --> 14:26.666
Blake Walton.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.601
Sweetest man, head of
our IT department.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.003
Yeah,
which is his office?

14:30.037 --> 14:31.604
Oh, well, he's not here today.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.640
Poor thing called in sick
this morning.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.576
BRODY:
Just got off with the NOPD.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.178
Nobody at Walton's home.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.646
LASALLE:
Dumped his financials.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.615
70K deposited into his account
as of three days ago.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.317
Guy calls in sick...
happens.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.119
Guy calls in sick
after a big payday...

14:46.153 --> 14:47.520
something is
definitely up.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.990
Yeah, especially if he drives
a black, four-door sedan

14:50.023 --> 14:52.292
that matches the description
of our getaway vehicle.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.094
I'll put a BOLO out.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.528
No need.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.697
Had the car manufacturer
hook us up with his GPS.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.033
Got a location:
Industrial Canal.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.301
I'll drive.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.574
BRODY:
Car still isn't moving.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.409
It's less than an eighth
of a mile from here.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.545
Everything all right?

15:12.579 --> 15:15.215
Mom. Over 30 texts.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.217
She's got the CIA
all over Boko Haram.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.319
"Just trying to help, dear."

15:19.352 --> 15:20.553
Well, help's a good thing.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.622
Oh, trust me,
"just trying to help"

15:22.655 --> 15:24.257
doesn't actually mean
she's just trying to help.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.059
"Just trying to help" means

15:26.093 --> 15:28.161
she doesn't trust us to find
her golden boy's killer.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.629
Complicated.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.131
Decoding Olivia Brody

15:31.164 --> 15:32.599
takes decryption software

15:32.632 --> 15:34.601
a thousand times more powerful
than PinZ0's.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.403
Okay, you gotta slow down.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.470
Why?
'Cause the car

15:37.504 --> 15:38.938
should be right here.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.142
Great.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.577
We'll call the scuba crew.

15:44.611 --> 15:48.248
Took the divers 20 minutes
to locate the car.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.516
PRIDE:
And Walton?

15:49.549 --> 15:50.750
Didn't see him.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.386
So Walton uses
Janis Leary's password

15:53.420 --> 15:54.554
to get intel on the heart.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.656
Passes it on
to our assassin...

15:56.689 --> 15:58.058
Then acts as
the getaway driver

15:58.091 --> 15:59.492
before dumping
the car in the drink

15:59.526 --> 16:00.627
to get rid of evidence.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.562
Gonna have to fume it
to get prints.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.531
Let's see what we can find.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.733
Or can't find.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.702
Seats in the back are missing

16:09.736 --> 16:10.737
to make room for
the bypass machine.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.173
Hey, guys.
PRIDE:
Yep?

16:13.206 --> 16:16.043
Walton didn't
ditch the car.
And why is that?

16:16.076 --> 16:17.977
'Cause I'm standing here
looking at him.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.056
WADE:
They cut his heart out.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.557
Only thing taken.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.725
All other organs
are accounted for.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.727
So two hearts.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.529
PinZ0's and Walton's.

16:36.563 --> 16:37.764
The first heart was shot,

16:37.797 --> 16:39.232
the second removed.

16:39.266 --> 16:40.467
Doesn't make sense.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.468
Which is why I went back

16:41.501 --> 16:42.569
and took a closer look

16:42.602 --> 16:44.137
at the one you recovered
this morning.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.575
I noticed the pulmonary trunk
was quite large--

16:48.608 --> 16:50.043
too large, in fact, to be viable

16:50.077 --> 16:51.744
for a transplant for PinZ0.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.514
So, I had Sebastian run

16:54.547 --> 16:56.716
an expedited DNA test
on the heart.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.718
Never guess who
it belongs to.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.788
Walton.

17:03.723 --> 17:07.127
Our killer swapped the hearts
to buy some time,

17:07.160 --> 17:08.761
make us think
this was about killing PinZ0.

17:08.795 --> 17:12.165
But this wasn't
an assassination.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.566
This was a heist.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.135
Which means...

17:15.168 --> 17:16.769
PinZ0's heart...

17:16.803 --> 17:19.172
is still out there.

17:32.152 --> 17:35.622
PinZ0's heart was removed from
the donor's chest at 8:15 a.m.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.657
At 9:10, it was
switched with Walton's

17:37.690 --> 17:39.459
in the back of
the paramedics' van.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.594
Now, assuming the heart's
in an HP machine now...

17:41.628 --> 17:43.863
we've got about seven hours
until it expires,

17:43.896 --> 17:45.532
along with the kid's chances.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.534
All right.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.835
Set a clock.

17:48.868 --> 17:51.104
Know what we're
working with.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.739
Any leads on
the heart's location?

17:52.772 --> 17:55.575
Over 3,500 people
on the transplant list,

17:55.608 --> 17:57.110
new names
added every day.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.212
The demand's higher
than the supply.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.847
Meaning unauthorized
organ sale's

18:00.880 --> 18:03.250
a multi-billion dollar industry.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.252
And with PinZ0's
HH blood type...

18:05.285 --> 18:06.419
His missing heart
is pretty much

18:06.453 --> 18:08.255
the Hope Diamond
of donor organs.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.124
Assuming our killer
has the heart,

18:11.158 --> 18:14.127
gotta also assume
he has a buyer.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.862
Still needs someone
to do the transplant.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.430
Well, there can only be
a handful of surgeons

18:17.464 --> 18:18.765
skilled enough
to do it.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.400
Now I'll compile a list.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.735
I find anything,
I'll let you know.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.737
My mother.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.139
She wants an update.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.574
I'll take that.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.209
Chris,

18:29.242 --> 18:30.810
search the wait list.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.379
Figure out who's
a match for that heart.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.780
Brody, get with Patton.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.215
Find me a seller.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.450
PATTON:
Request for a pinky...

18:37.484 --> 18:40.320
pair of kidneys.

18:40.353 --> 18:43.256
Ooh. Brand-new set of corneas
strike your fancy?

18:43.290 --> 18:45.158
20/20 vision,
thank you very much.

18:45.192 --> 18:47.394
All right, we'll just
stick to the heart.

18:47.427 --> 18:50.297
Narrowing the search.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.565
Oh. Wait a minute. Wait...

18:52.599 --> 18:54.867
Hey, we being watched.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.738
Back door code
running a spy node.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.673
Oh, wait...

19:00.707 --> 19:02.909
Oh...

19:02.942 --> 19:05.212
Somebody's hacking my server.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.814
Whoever this is is good.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.249
But I'm better.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.883
Hold on.

19:12.219 --> 19:13.586
Gotcha.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.621
Can you get a location?

19:16.256 --> 19:17.357
Oh, hell no.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.830
You're spying on me?

19:23.863 --> 19:26.266
It's my heart.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.734
My life.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.236
I deserve to know what's up.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.838
You gotta let us work.
And trust us.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.240
Please.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.907
Last people I trusted

19:34.941 --> 19:36.909
were the pediatricians who
misdiagnosed my condition.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.412
Lost five years where I

19:39.446 --> 19:40.780
could've been
on the transplant list.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.449
I get it.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.351
It sucks when your body
won't do what you ask it to.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.918
I see what you're doing.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.855
Trying this whole "you and I
are the same" business.

19:48.888 --> 19:52.225
But we're not.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.626
I was born
this way.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.263
Don't get the sense
you were.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.800
How'd you end up
in that chair, anyway?

20:02.435 --> 20:03.836
Bear attack.

20:05.405 --> 20:08.241
Accident in a demolition derby.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.776
I'm serious.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.279
Okay, serious.

20:12.312 --> 20:15.648
Nagano, Winter Olympics, 1998.

20:15.682 --> 20:16.949
Men's ice skating.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.618
I fell doing a triple Salchow.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.453
Takes a rotation speed

20:20.487 --> 20:22.489
of approximately
two revolutions per second

20:22.522 --> 20:25.292
to successfully land
that maneuver.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.760
Judging from the excess weight
around your midsection...

20:27.794 --> 20:29.562
I don't see it.

20:29.596 --> 20:32.265
Who knew Rain Boy
owned the funny?

20:32.299 --> 20:33.933
Eh, what can I say?

20:33.966 --> 20:35.302
I'm well-rounded.

20:35.335 --> 20:38.004
Not as well-rounded
as you, but...

20:38.037 --> 20:39.772
Oh, and again!

20:39.806 --> 20:42.342
'Kay, well, from here forward...

20:42.375 --> 20:43.810
you stick to the jokes.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.378
'Cause if you hack
our servers again,

20:45.412 --> 20:47.414
I'll be the one setting up
your Wi-Fi.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.648
In your jail cell.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.317
No jail cell for me.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.651
My investigation was sanctioned.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.886
Sanctioned by who?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.588
You told PinZ0
to hack us?

20:55.622 --> 20:58.391
We needed to access your
hospital surveillance footage.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.393
And asking wasn't
a possibility?

21:00.427 --> 21:02.495
Asking doesn't always
get me to yes.

21:02.529 --> 21:05.432
Look, we have developed
cutting edge

21:05.465 --> 21:08.435
photo encryption software.

21:08.468 --> 21:12.405
If we just have one image
of the killer's face,

21:12.439 --> 21:13.873
then we can identify him.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.309
We scanned hospital
footage and all cams

21:16.343 --> 21:17.310
within a 20-mile radius.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.078
If we had something to share,
we'd share it.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.480
How can we work together

21:20.513 --> 21:22.315
if you don't trust me?

21:22.349 --> 21:24.451
You're slouching again.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.084
Don't do that.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.686
What?
That.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.621
You don't actually care
that I'm slouching.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.090
Really? What do you think
I actually care about?

21:31.123 --> 21:32.725
I don't know.
You know what, I've never known.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.527
I would love for you to
be straightforward, for once.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.463
I would love to know what
you are actually thinking.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.764
LASALLE:
Brody?

21:37.797 --> 21:40.032
Percy's found a
cardiothoracic surgeon,

21:40.066 --> 21:41.334
Susan Gatley.

21:41.368 --> 21:42.802
Works at St. Charles Hospital.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.537
She qualified to do
this surgery?

21:44.571 --> 21:46.439
And she's been MIA
since this morning.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.007
Percy's on the way to Gatley's
house now.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.376
She's gonna meet us there.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.477
We'll keep you posted.

21:50.510 --> 21:53.546
Thank you.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.388
The heart's local.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.823
So it makes sense
the surgeon would be, too.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.460
Trouble.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.028
LASALLE:
Looks like we're late

22:09.061 --> 22:10.430
to the party.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.066
Federal agents!

22:32.552 --> 22:34.721
Clear.

22:34.754 --> 22:35.888
Clear.

22:37.089 --> 22:40.527
Early morning B&E.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.763
Looks like someone
took the doc by force.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.998
Brings her to where the heart
and the patient are waiting.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.934
All right.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.536
See what we can find.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.571
I'll, uh, check out the back.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.717
Damn it!

23:08.220 --> 23:10.990
You're not a canine kind
of person, are you, Percy?

23:11.023 --> 23:12.525
I like them just fine

23:12.559 --> 23:15.094
as long
as they don't call me lunch.

23:16.496 --> 23:17.964
Hey, guys,
what's that in his mouth?

23:17.997 --> 23:19.398
It looks like blood.

23:24.671 --> 23:27.474
Looks like he took
a bite outta crime.

23:27.507 --> 23:28.675
What now?

23:28.708 --> 23:31.578
All right, stand back, ladies,

23:31.611 --> 23:34.547
and watch the dog whisperer
do his work.

23:36.716 --> 23:39.719
Hello, poochie pooch-pooch.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.554
It just ain't right.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.623
30 minutes ago,
this dog was ready to kill.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.459
Poochie-poochie
goes a long way.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.127
Here's a fun fact:

23:48.160 --> 23:49.929
Do you know the breed
is actually called

23:49.962 --> 23:51.631
the German shepherd dog?

23:51.664 --> 23:53.566
So as not to be mistaken

23:53.600 --> 23:54.934
with a German shepherd?

23:54.967 --> 23:58.204
As in a German person
who tends livestock?

23:58.237 --> 24:00.573
I like Germans, you know?

24:00.607 --> 24:01.774
They're kind of like M&M'S.

24:01.808 --> 24:02.975
They're hard on the outside

24:03.009 --> 24:04.110
but soft in the middle.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.578
Except this one,

24:05.612 --> 24:07.079
who had a killer's blood

24:07.113 --> 24:09.115
in its terrifying maw.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.517
That's a valid point.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.719
So I got DNA results back

24:12.752 --> 24:14.921
from the aforementioned
mouth blood.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.624
Gaylan Conroy.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.926
Recently served a stint
in Walpole Correctional.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.628
Based out of Boston.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.596
Got seven years for extortion

24:23.630 --> 24:26.966
and a reputation for
being a gun for hire.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.969
Well, the question is
who's he work for?

24:30.002 --> 24:32.171
I'll put a BOLO out.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.244
Conroy's already been flagged.

24:38.277 --> 24:41.147
Charleston PD's looking for him.
Car theft.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.915
Looks like they got
a photo of him

24:42.949 --> 24:44.684
crossing a toll bridge.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.185
Well, who's the
mystery passenger?

24:46.218 --> 24:47.520
Uh, I-I might be able
to enhance that

24:47.554 --> 24:48.855
if you let me tag in.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.557
By all means, proceed.

24:50.590 --> 24:53.192
All right, let's, uh...

24:53.225 --> 24:54.661
up the resolution here.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.565
And sharpen the pixels.

24:58.598 --> 25:00.199
BRODY: Still blurry.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.534
If only we knew
someone with access

25:01.568 --> 25:02.569
to top secret photo
software that...

25:02.602 --> 25:04.270
Fine. Fine. Fine.

25:04.303 --> 25:06.238
I will call her.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.240
Okay? I'll call her.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.580
OLIVIA:
The trick is reducing

25:13.613 --> 25:15.281
the size of the bitmap

25:15.314 --> 25:18.918
to restore
the original resolution, and...

25:18.951 --> 25:21.754
there he is.

25:21.788 --> 25:23.222
Nice work, Mama Brody.

25:23.255 --> 25:24.791
Thank you, Christopher.

25:24.824 --> 25:27.126
Mom, I'm gonna need
my desk back.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.995
I need to run it
through Bruce.

25:30.663 --> 25:31.864
Oh.
PRIDE:
Won't be necessary.

25:31.898 --> 25:34.066
Thomas Dolan.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.102
Seen him on Interpol

25:36.135 --> 25:37.804
and the FBI's Most Wanted
bulletin.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.972
Been in hiding two years.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.775
Rings a bell from the ATF.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.112
Extortion, racketeering,
money laundering,

25:46.145 --> 25:47.313
murder.

25:47.346 --> 25:48.781
I mean, this guy's a bad man.

25:48.815 --> 25:50.182
With the rap sheet like that,

25:50.216 --> 25:53.019
why resurface
to steal a heart?

25:53.052 --> 25:54.787
Ready for this?

25:54.821 --> 25:56.989
FBI's medical dossier on Dolan
says he was diagnosed

25:57.023 --> 25:58.991
with a heart condition
three years ago.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.192
Want to know the blood type?

26:00.226 --> 26:03.229
HH. Same as PinZ0's.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.364
Thomas Dolan stole the heart

26:05.397 --> 26:08.067
for himself.

26:21.748 --> 26:24.250
Thomas Dolan pays
IT specialist Walton

26:24.283 --> 26:26.753
to tip him off when a heart
becomes available.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.254
Hires Conroy to steal it.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.922
Picks up a heart surgeon
to boot.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.323
Meaning find Dolan...

26:31.357 --> 26:33.092
Find the heart.

26:33.125 --> 26:36.228
All right, Chris,
dump traffic cams.

26:36.262 --> 26:37.764
Tollbooths and ATMs.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.098
I'll update the BOLO.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.767
PRIDE:
Sonja with me.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.803
Open heart surgeries
needs supplies,

26:43.836 --> 26:45.638
machines, medications.

26:45.672 --> 26:47.173
We find who bought them,

26:47.206 --> 26:51.678
might also find out where
this is all going down.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.245
We've purchased everything
we could legally acquire

26:53.279 --> 26:55.314
to perform a transplant surgery.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.950
Yeah, we got vascular clips,
rib and sternum retractors,

26:57.984 --> 26:59.418
aorta clamps,

26:59.451 --> 27:00.286
heart monitor,
plus they threw in

27:00.319 --> 27:02.188
this spiffy doctor's coat
for free.

27:02.221 --> 27:03.823
Do you know how hard it is
for me to find something

27:03.856 --> 27:04.824
that fits like this
right off the rack?

27:04.857 --> 27:06.158
PRIDE:
So, this is

27:06.192 --> 27:07.359
the legal stuff?

27:07.393 --> 27:09.128
Yeah, and as for
the illegal stuff,

27:09.161 --> 27:11.130
we're talking, uh,
pharmacological anesthesias

27:11.163 --> 27:13.833
like azathioprine
and anticoagulants.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.868
And then there's
the hardware.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.340
This is a
cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

27:21.373 --> 27:22.942
Keeps the blood circulating.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.044
Costs hundreds
of thousands of dollars

27:25.077 --> 27:29.048
and it's only sold to
licensed medical professionals.

27:29.081 --> 27:30.983
Yeah, you can only get your
hands on one of these bad boys

27:31.017 --> 27:33.319
if you steal it or if you
buy it off the black market.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.321
Dark Web.
Illegal medical equipment's

27:35.354 --> 27:36.823
on there all the time.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.457
Patton. I'll call.

27:38.490 --> 27:41.761
I'll get Brody to start checking
in with the manufacturers.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.896
You kept the receipt for
all this stuff, right?

27:43.930 --> 27:45.932
I hope we can return it.

27:48.434 --> 27:50.136
Cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.904
I see you have one
in your warehouse.

27:51.938 --> 27:53.873
I'm just checking to see
that it's still there.

27:53.906 --> 27:56.142
WOMAN: Can you hold?
No, I don't have time.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.745
And you put me on hold.

27:58.778 --> 27:59.812
Find that machine yet?

27:59.846 --> 28:02.281
I'm working on it.

28:02.314 --> 28:04.751
Max is a special boy, Merri.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.786
A brilliant boy.

28:06.819 --> 28:09.922
We only have 90 minutes left.

28:09.956 --> 28:11.290
You don't think I know that?

28:13.525 --> 28:15.728
Yeah, yeah, sure you do.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.099
"What was I thinking."

28:20.132 --> 28:21.801
Sorry?

28:21.834 --> 28:23.435
You asked me before.

28:23.469 --> 28:25.337
You wanted to know exactly
what I was thinking.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.873
I'll tell you.

28:26.906 --> 28:29.341
Despite what you might believe,

28:29.375 --> 28:33.012
I trust you more
than you will ever know.

28:38.885 --> 28:41.087
Coffee.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.792
Tell me it's spiked
with gin.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.760
You okay?

28:47.794 --> 28:51.397
One second she trusts me,
and the next second

28:51.430 --> 28:53.365
she goes up there
so she can literally

28:53.399 --> 28:55.768
look over my shoulder.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.904
Classic push me, pull me.

28:57.937 --> 29:01.373
I know a thing
or two about that.

29:01.407 --> 29:02.508
My brother Cade.

29:02.541 --> 29:05.177
Whenever he heads down
the psychological rabbit hole,

29:05.211 --> 29:07.513
one minute he's asking
for help,

29:07.546 --> 29:09.949
the next he's chucking
beer bottles at my head.

29:09.982 --> 29:13.419
Hidden meaning
behind this flying glass?

29:13.452 --> 29:15.855
Whether he knows it or not,

29:15.888 --> 29:18.290
pushing me away

29:18.324 --> 29:21.260
only makes me fight hard
to get closer to him.

29:21.293 --> 29:24.463
Nobody wants to face
their demons alone.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.132
WOMAN :
Hello?

29:26.165 --> 29:27.967
Are you still there?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.202
Yes, yes, still there.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.905
Hi.

29:32.939 --> 29:34.473
Great. Model number?

29:34.506 --> 29:37.076
Thank you, thank you.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.111
Okay, Nova-Pilsner Medical,

29:39.145 --> 29:41.080
manufacturer out of Texas,
just reported

29:41.113 --> 29:43.382
a first generation
cardiopulmonary machine

29:43.415 --> 29:45.852
stolen from their
recycling plant two months ago.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.989
There she is.

29:50.022 --> 29:53.125
An A68 Nova-Pilsner Medical
Heart and Lung Machine

29:53.159 --> 29:56.395
sold on the Dark Web
to the highest bidder.

29:56.428 --> 29:57.830
Outdated model.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.498
I was hooked up to it once.

30:00.599 --> 30:01.834
Long time ago.

30:01.868 --> 30:03.235
Well, whoever bought
this machine...

30:03.269 --> 30:04.570
Is the person with my heart?

30:04.603 --> 30:06.338
That's our guess.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.012
Sucks.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.347
What?
Buyer's untraceable.

30:17.516 --> 30:20.152
If my code was finished,

30:20.186 --> 30:23.022
I could locate
where it was purchased,

30:23.055 --> 30:25.257
save my own life.

30:25.291 --> 30:26.859
You ever look

30:26.893 --> 30:29.328
at your relay
decryption algorithm?

30:29.361 --> 30:30.997
I been poking around your code.

30:31.030 --> 30:33.265
You can't do that.
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

30:33.299 --> 30:35.101
After you hacked my server,
Rain Boy,

30:35.134 --> 30:37.136
you lost the right
to can and can't.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.571
Now, about your algorithm.

30:39.605 --> 30:41.373
If you throw in
a set variance key,

30:41.407 --> 30:43.575
you might cut your
trace time in half.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.344
Believe me I've considered it,
but that would take

30:45.377 --> 30:47.213
another year or two,
which I don't have.

30:47.246 --> 30:49.615
Might not have.

30:49.648 --> 30:52.451
Three months
and an HH blood type?

30:53.953 --> 30:57.556
That was the only heart,

30:57.589 --> 30:59.358
and even if you recover it,

30:59.391 --> 31:01.093
the odds of it still
being viable are...

31:01.127 --> 31:02.895
Would you stop
with the odds, kid?

31:02.929 --> 31:05.965
Listen, man, after
I had my accident,

31:05.998 --> 31:08.134
the odds of me moving
anything below my neck

31:08.167 --> 31:10.069
as a million to one.

31:10.102 --> 31:11.971
Had I given up,

31:12.004 --> 31:15.107
I would've got a bed
instead of a sled.

31:16.142 --> 31:17.309
So it was an accident?

31:17.343 --> 31:20.079
I flipped a car doing 300

31:20.112 --> 31:21.247
on the Royal Raceway.

31:24.050 --> 31:26.452
Royal Raceway only exists
in Mario Kart.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.960
Guess you're not planning on
telling me the truth.

31:33.993 --> 31:34.961
Not while there's
work to be done.

31:34.994 --> 31:36.328
What are you doing?

31:36.362 --> 31:38.497
Well, if you can't
finish your code,

31:38.530 --> 31:41.000
we gotta attack this problem
from a different angle.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.002
Find the machine,
not the buyer.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.671
Okay, you gotta read
the manual.

31:45.704 --> 31:48.340
"Offline on-board computer...

31:48.374 --> 31:51.177
"controls the BMP rate...

31:51.210 --> 31:53.079
"controls the blood flow...

31:53.112 --> 31:54.180
controls the voltage
to the machine..."

31:54.213 --> 31:56.015
This is the new model.

31:56.048 --> 31:57.116
The old model doesn't have
that functionality.

31:59.451 --> 32:00.652
"Requires a..."
"...steady voltage."

32:00.686 --> 32:02.221
Bingo!

32:02.254 --> 32:04.723
Hang in there, Rain Boy,
your odds of finishing your code

32:04.756 --> 32:06.959
just got a hell of a lot better.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.062
BRODY: Wherever this surgery
is going down,

32:10.096 --> 32:10.997
they've got to have a regulated

32:11.030 --> 32:12.098
flow of electricity.

32:12.131 --> 32:13.432
LASALLE:
City-wide search.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.968
Only buildings
with voltage regulators

32:16.002 --> 32:18.037
are hospitals
and medical centers.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.039
Been no calls about
hijacked operating rooms.

32:20.072 --> 32:22.141
You gotta assume they're
working under the radar.

32:22.174 --> 32:24.543
Abandoned hospitals,
clinics, walk-ins.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.045
We gotta find this thing.

32:26.078 --> 32:28.080
Okay, there are 97
medical facilities

32:28.114 --> 32:29.548
in the greater
New Orleans area.

32:29.581 --> 32:33.285
88 operational, nine
shut down... and of the nine,

32:33.319 --> 32:35.021
only one of them
is currently

32:35.054 --> 32:36.522
drawing power
from the grid:

32:36.555 --> 32:39.158
Lafayette Memorial
Hospital, in Terrytown.

32:39.191 --> 32:40.359
Smart.

32:40.392 --> 32:41.193
Let's move!

32:54.406 --> 32:56.075
Nothing on the south end.

33:00.412 --> 33:03.049
:
Headed for the lab now.

33:24.203 --> 33:26.105
(indistinct conversation
in distance)

33:28.240 --> 33:32.411
(indistinct conversation
continues)

33:32.444 --> 33:33.712
Conroy.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.182
Got eyes on Conroy.

33:45.424 --> 33:48.127
*

34:01.640 --> 34:03.209
NCIS! Put your weapon down!

34:05.377 --> 34:06.212
NCIS!

34:09.215 --> 34:10.216
Let's go.

34:30.236 --> 34:31.837
Conroy's headed your way.

34:36.508 --> 34:37.809
Drop the weapon! Now!

34:37.843 --> 34:39.511
Come on!

34:39.545 --> 34:41.280
Hands where we can see 'em.

34:41.313 --> 34:42.348
Come on!
Get 'em up!

34:42.381 --> 34:43.582
Come to me, now!

34:43.615 --> 34:45.217
Nice and slow!

34:45.251 --> 34:45.717
Turn around!

34:45.751 --> 34:47.619
On your knees!

34:47.653 --> 34:48.887
Cross your legs.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.822
Get your hands on your head.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.759
Gaylan Conroy...

34:53.792 --> 34:56.428
you're under arrest for the
murder of four members...

34:56.462 --> 34:58.297
of the United States Navy.

35:01.733 --> 35:04.403
Please! Don't shoot.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.272
NCIS.

35:06.305 --> 35:07.273
You're gonna be okay.

35:07.306 --> 35:08.440
They put a gun
to my head.

35:08.474 --> 35:09.575
They made me do it.

35:09.608 --> 35:10.809
But he was too weak.

35:10.842 --> 35:12.411
His eyes are fixed and dilated.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.545
He's brain dead.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.314
Dr. Gatley...

35:15.347 --> 35:16.448
Dr. Gatley!

35:16.482 --> 35:17.649
Yes?

35:17.683 --> 35:20.286
The heart--

35:20.319 --> 35:21.653
where is it?

35:21.687 --> 35:23.289
It's inside him.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.371
(indistinct police radio
communication)

35:41.707 --> 35:43.875
SONJA:
We got 15 minutes left!

35:43.909 --> 35:45.711
Flight to the hospital
will take ten!

35:45.744 --> 35:48.847
Even then, chance of the
transplant rejection are likely.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.282
Likely, but not certain.

35:50.316 --> 35:52.418
Keep pumping!
Keep this heart alive!

35:53.852 --> 35:55.721
He's been off the machine
for three minutes,

35:55.754 --> 35:58.224
got a recipient who needs
this heart

35:58.257 --> 36:00.859
waiting at Stewartson
Navy Base, at the hospital.

36:00.892 --> 36:02.160
Go now!

36:15.274 --> 36:16.375
Yeah.

36:16.408 --> 36:18.777
Heli's gonna be here in five.

36:18.810 --> 36:19.745
P, it's showtime, man.

36:20.779 --> 36:22.648
You know...

36:22.681 --> 36:23.815
this was sort of fun.

36:23.849 --> 36:24.583
Ha, ha.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.719
Fun is Bourbon Street,
Fat Tuesday.

36:29.355 --> 36:31.323
When you're a little better,
a little older,

36:31.357 --> 36:32.858
I'll show you
the world, kid.

36:32.891 --> 36:36.295
Got to administer the sedative.

36:36.328 --> 36:37.729
Hey, your, uh...

36:37.763 --> 36:38.797
adjustments to my code,

36:38.830 --> 36:41.633
relay decryption algorithm...

36:41.667 --> 36:42.834
that's not bad.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.471
Really

36:45.504 --> 36:47.406
Almost good, even.

36:47.439 --> 36:50.376
Aw, don't go soft
on me now... Rain Boy.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.613
Y-You should stay on that.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.249
When you're recovered.

36:57.283 --> 36:59.585
That's more important
to me than anything.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.688
I'm-I'm gonna need
someone to finish it,

37:02.721 --> 37:03.855
if I don't make it.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.991
What you need is
to go get your heart.

37:06.024 --> 37:08.860
See you on the other side,
all right?

37:08.894 --> 37:10.329
Okay.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.863
Ready?
: Yeah?

37:11.897 --> 37:13.665
Software update?
: Yeah.

37:13.699 --> 37:15.701
PinZ0 2.0.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.769
I'll be waiting for you.
: Okay.

37:17.803 --> 37:18.770
I'm behind you.

37:18.804 --> 37:19.771
Come here.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.907
Give me your hand.

37:21.940 --> 37:25.277
* It's getting cold
and I just don't care *

37:25.311 --> 37:30.849
* So I'm gonna find something
else to do *

37:30.882 --> 37:33.919
* Uh-huh

37:33.952 --> 37:37.823
* Just take a really good
look at me *

37:37.856 --> 37:42.594
* I'm 22 and I still
don't see why *

37:42.628 --> 37:44.363
* All of you people

37:44.396 --> 37:46.598
* Can't get along

37:46.632 --> 37:47.999
* Anymore

37:49.901 --> 37:53.472
* 'Cause falling down
ain't so hard to do *

37:53.505 --> 37:56.808
* Your only crutch be
the bottle of brew *

37:56.842 --> 38:01.980
* So I'm gonna find
something else to do *

38:02.013 --> 38:03.982
* Uh-huh

38:05.417 --> 38:09.321
* 'Cause if I ever was
to say to you *

38:09.355 --> 38:13.325
* All them things
that you wanted me to love *

38:13.359 --> 38:17.963
* I'd have to find something
else to do *

38:17.996 --> 38:19.565
* Uh-huh

38:21.700 --> 38:26.505
* So I'm gonna stand here
by your fire... *

38:26.538 --> 38:27.806
Percy.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.741
Wake up.

38:29.775 --> 38:31.943
* I'm taking care
of soulfight... *

38:31.977 --> 38:34.413
What's the word?

38:34.446 --> 38:36.648
* And you're the reason...

38:36.682 --> 38:39.918
Doc said that the heart
was in bad shape

38:39.951 --> 38:43.989
by the time
they got it in him.

38:44.022 --> 38:45.491
That kid fought like hell.

38:45.524 --> 38:47.826
* I'm taking care
of soulfight... *

38:47.859 --> 38:49.395
But it didn't take.

38:49.428 --> 38:53.932
* And you're the reason why

38:53.965 --> 38:58.670
* So I'm gonna stand here
by your fire *

38:58.704 --> 39:02.107
* 'Cause it's a cold one
tonight *

39:02.140 --> 39:06.478
* Taking care of soulfight

39:06.512 --> 39:11.049
* And you're the reason...

39:11.082 --> 39:14.052
* Why.

39:18.857 --> 39:19.925
(knocking on door,
door opens)

39:23.962 --> 39:25.397
You all right?

39:28.133 --> 39:31.703
Not in the least.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.739
Hard to beat the odds, man.

39:39.678 --> 39:42.080
Genius...

39:42.113 --> 39:44.382
trapped in a hospital bed.

39:47.185 --> 39:50.055
Nothing but a computer screen
to live life through.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.060
It's gotta bring up things.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.730
He kept asking me
how I got in the chair.

40:00.566 --> 40:01.900
Did you tell him?

40:04.903 --> 40:07.005
What difference does it make?

40:07.038 --> 40:10.075
I made the decision that this
would never hold me back,

40:10.108 --> 40:13.512
and I told him the same
before he went under.

40:13.545 --> 40:15.647
Got to look forward,
that's what life is.

40:15.681 --> 40:17.048
*

40:17.082 --> 40:19.017
You're a good man,
Triple P.

40:21.219 --> 40:23.088
You did everything you could.

40:26.692 --> 40:27.993
Don't wait for me, King.

40:51.182 --> 40:53.018
You think
I did everything, Pride?

41:01.092 --> 41:02.828
Almost everything.
