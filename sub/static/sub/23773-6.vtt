FILM 6

01:08.520 --> 01:14.040
<i>When you reach a dead end,</i>
<i>then your path opens up.</i>

01:16.480 --> 01:20.440
MOSCOW / 1971 - SCHOOL No. 585

01:20.520 --> 01:22.960
Since then, children,

01:23.680 --> 01:25.560
almost 30 years have passed.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.840
But we remember

01:27.920 --> 01:32.160
and honor
Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya’s heroic act.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.320
I’m going to show you some pictures.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.320
These are horrific pictures.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.400
But I want you to see them.

01:44.080 --> 01:48.040
Think about
what this girl was going though.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.480
She wasn’t much older than you are.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.000
Look at this.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.720
And remember it.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.480
Her body hung for a month.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.160
And right before the New Year,

02:08.880 --> 02:10.600
drunken Germans,

02:11.200 --> 02:13.120
after Zoya was already dead…

02:14.440 --> 02:15.640
undressed her

02:16.400 --> 02:19.840
and began stabbing her body…
with bayonets.

02:33.440 --> 02:34.960
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

02:36.680 --> 02:37.880
<i>I love you.</i>

02:38.360 --> 02:40.800
You know, based on this evidence,

02:40.880 --> 02:43.440
I get the impression
that he was just a con artist.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.120
He’d take out all the killers on the spot.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.880
What for?
So that we couldn’t question them?

02:49.960 --> 02:52.840
Did you ever notice
the murders would stop after that?

02:52.920 --> 02:54.520
But we don’t know why.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.680
The murderers could have gone into hiding,
could be lying low.

02:58.760 --> 03:01.440
How many times have we put away
the wrong person?

03:01.520 --> 03:03.480
I understand. You became close.

03:03.560 --> 03:04.760
But think about it.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.040
-A drug addict, an alcoholic--
-That’s not true!

03:07.120 --> 03:10.680
A lunatic who was simply fooling everyone.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.080
He made up this “method”--

03:12.160 --> 03:15.080
-Don’t you dare say that!
-…that no one understood.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.400
What kind of method is it?
What’s it about?

03:18.120 --> 03:19.520
Esenya Andreyevna,

03:20.440 --> 03:22.880
I don’t condone my colleague’s fervor,

03:22.960 --> 03:24.800
but I share his frustration.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.760
Starting with the Tsvetkov case,

03:28.320 --> 03:31.680
you and Meglin worked as equals,
and at times you’d replace him

03:31.760 --> 03:35.240
without compromising the case
or using the method.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.560
Starting with the Tsvetkov’s case…

03:42.200 --> 03:43.800
I used it too.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.800
There was no rape.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.200
She was hanged while still alive,
just like the other two.

03:56.800 --> 03:57.800
Not quite.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.920
I can stop if you already know everything.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.120
Palych, pride is a foolish quality
to have in a medical examiner.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.600
Don’t leave me hanging.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.440
I’m not a medical examiner. I’m an expert.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.120
I’m telling you-- pride. Why did you say “not quite”?

04:15.920 --> 04:17.640
Did you see the skin on her neck?

04:17.720 --> 04:21.160
When a victim is conscious,
the body will jerk in the noose.

04:21.240 --> 04:24.960
It leaves ligature marks on the neck,
especially on the delicate skin of women.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.280
And the ligature marks…

04:28.760 --> 04:29.960
aren’t here.

04:30.760 --> 04:35.160
I have better things to do than marvel
at the delicate skin of a corpse.

04:35.760 --> 04:39.000
You said it,
then paused so that I’d ask you, right?

04:39.080 --> 04:41.720
You know something,
but you’re not saying it.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.400
Do you want to impress me?

04:43.480 --> 04:44.480
So, go ahead.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.920
She was hanged while she was still alive,
but… unconscious, right?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.600
No, not unconscious.
But she was not conscious either.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.920
How’s that? You’re scaring me.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.200
Here’s how.

04:55.920 --> 05:00.440
You’ll never guess
what I found in their stomachs.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.440
A signed confession. Next.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.040
No.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.760
Sponge cake.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.560
-With a sedative.
-I wish.

05:13.960 --> 05:16.760
I analyzed the composition,
but it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen.

05:17.440 --> 05:21.120
The cake contained tropane alkaloids--
scopolamine.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.680
-What is it?
-A truth serum.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.280
The military uses it in interrogations.
It suppresses willpower.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.400
The victim realizes everything
that’s going on, but can’t resist.

05:30.040 --> 05:33.960
Most interestingly,
the scopolamine in the cake

05:34.040 --> 05:37.120
was not in the form of a drug
but rather in its natural form.

05:37.720 --> 05:41.680
And it only occurs naturally
in <i>Datura innoxia</i>.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.120
Does he grow that <i>Datura</i> at home?

05:52.400 --> 05:54.000
Oh, Palych.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.320
Give me the flask.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.280
-Where is it?
-In the glove box.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.440
What’s this?

06:40.200 --> 06:41.400
Morphine.

06:48.560 --> 06:49.560
Hi, ladies!

06:50.240 --> 06:51.280
Yes, Dad.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.720
Can you spare a cigarette?

06:52.800 --> 06:55.000
Of course I am. Who else would I be with?

06:55.480 --> 06:56.880
-What?
-Thank you.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.680
What do you mean “get some rest?”

06:59.400 --> 07:01.160
I don’t really feel tired.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.760
No, Dad, it’s a good idea, but--

07:08.240 --> 07:10.840
Why does it bother him so much
that I work with you?

07:10.920 --> 07:13.960
Who’s gonna like his daughter
sleeping with a maniac?

07:14.040 --> 07:15.320
I’m not sleeping with you.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.720
Right.
How are you going to prove that to him?

07:17.800 --> 07:21.320
What are you doing all this time with me?
Learning? Ridiculous!

07:21.400 --> 07:23.080
What can I teach you?

07:23.160 --> 07:24.520
I’m not a teacher.

07:24.600 --> 07:25.920
Are you the detective?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.080
Yes. Good afternoon. Victor Suchkov.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.120
You must have gotten teased as a kid,
right?

07:32.280 --> 07:34.760
No. Excuse me, you are…

07:35.360 --> 07:39.080
the strength,
the inviolability of family bonds.

07:39.800 --> 07:43.080
Family values determine…

07:44.680 --> 07:48.280
the stable social, demographic,

07:48.360 --> 07:52.320
and even economic growth of any state.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.600
This determines…

07:58.040 --> 08:00.720
To conclude this lecture,

08:00.800 --> 08:04.120
I’d like to emphasize that preserving
the institution of the family…

08:05.160 --> 08:10.440
is a strategic goal of all ideologies
regardless of their political systems.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.880
Basically, the family has been
the main ideological institution…

08:18.040 --> 08:22.800
throughout the entire history of humanity.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.440
Thank you. Class dismissed.

08:31.520 --> 08:32.520
Let’s go.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.360
So, this is Sergei Leonidovich,

08:39.440 --> 08:42.120
the head
of the Department of Family Psychology.

08:42.200 --> 08:46.440
Major Meglin and Lieutenant Steklova
from the Investigative Committee.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.400
We’re listening.

08:50.880 --> 08:55.520
You know, there is--
It’s not that I suspect him or anything.

08:57.280 --> 09:00.120
I just have to inform you
that there’s a professor

09:00.200 --> 09:05.560
in the Department of Extreme Psychology--
Zhukov Andrei Ivanovich.

09:05.640 --> 09:06.360
And?

09:06.960 --> 09:11.560
And he pays… special attention
to the female students.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.440
I’ve told him that this goes against…

09:16.360 --> 09:19.720
Never mind.
I shouldn’t be saying any of this.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.200
No, you’re doing the right thing.

09:24.760 --> 09:27.480
-Is he here today?
-He’s giving a lecture right away.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.000
He…

09:31.960 --> 09:33.440
There he is.

09:37.920 --> 09:38.920
Hello.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.360
Good afternoon.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.000
Excuse me.

09:47.080 --> 09:49.520
May we sit in on your lecture?

09:49.600 --> 09:51.320
We heard it’s very interesting.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.720
Excuse me, who are you?

09:56.240 --> 09:58.760
We’re from EMERCOM. We’re here to learn.

09:58.840 --> 10:02.640
You were recommended
as an expert on extreme psychology.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.840
Well, have a seat.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.720
The factors intensifying traumatic stress

10:11.440 --> 10:15.240
are the perception of an event
as highly unfair,

10:16.160 --> 10:22.120
the inability or incapacity to deal with
the situation, at least to some extent,

10:22.200 --> 10:25.200
and finally, passive behavior, the presence of unresolved trauma,

10:28.360 --> 10:30.880
as well as physical exhaustion.

10:30.960 --> 10:34.080
Also, a destabilizing organization of work

10:34.160 --> 10:37.440
and the specialist’s state of health.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.840
Good physical health

10:40.920 --> 10:43.640
as well as corporate culture.

10:43.720 --> 10:46.000
-Thus, we can draw the conclusion--
-It’s him.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.600
…that the psychology of the victim
is the main reason…

10:48.680 --> 10:50.160
Of course. Why not?

10:50.960 --> 10:53.560
He has access to students.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.480
He’s very charming.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.880
Look at her.

10:59.960 --> 11:04.640
She’s ready to give herself
to extreme psychology right now.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.760
…and does not give in to primal instincts.

11:07.840 --> 11:11.360
In short,
your well-being is in your own hands.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.600
What are they talking about?

11:31.120 --> 11:34.880
I think he’s offering to continue
the lecture in a private setting.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.640
For a deeper analysis, so to speak.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.200
We should follow him.

11:42.400 --> 11:47.480
TWO HOURS LATER

11:47.560 --> 11:48.760
There we go.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.640
Let’s hurry. Come on. Let’s go.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.600
Can you hurry up?

12:20.880 --> 12:22.080
Hurry up.

12:27.840 --> 12:28.720
They’re in here.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.120
-Over here?
-In here.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.400
So? He’s not gonna do it here.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.480
He has to feed her the scopolamine first.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.400
You’re thinking logically.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.880
I think this is what he’s doing right now.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.800
So we need to wait
until he feeds her the cake?

12:46.280 --> 12:49.080
Of course it’s cynical,
but we’ll catch him red-handed.

12:49.680 --> 12:53.400
Before he starts saying,
“It’s not mine. They planted it.”

12:53.480 --> 12:55.320
-We’ll wait.
-Of course.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.520
Why does he kill?

13:19.600 --> 13:23.840
He doesn’t look like an awkward geek
who was bullied as a child.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.160
He’s attractive. Women like him.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.840
Why does he do this?

13:30.400 --> 13:31.880
We’ll ask him.

13:39.640 --> 13:41.360
Get off her, you pig!

13:42.240 --> 13:44.360
What’s going on? What are you doing?

13:44.440 --> 13:45.560
-Did you have cake?
-What?

13:45.640 --> 13:47.400
Did you have cake, you idiot?

13:47.480 --> 13:48.320
No!

13:48.400 --> 13:51.160
Well, congratulations, pal.
I gotta hand it to you.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.480
-What number is she?
-What’s going on?

13:55.200 --> 13:56.880
Is it for a grade, or is it love?

13:57.480 --> 13:58.960
It’s up to you,

13:59.040 --> 14:01.880
but he has another 20 years
of teaching here.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.440
So you’re not gonna be the last one.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.480
Here’s my advice.

14:06.560 --> 14:09.880
Get this “till death do us part” nonsense
out of your head

14:09.960 --> 14:11.880
and go after the sex.

14:12.360 --> 14:15.000
You’ll gain experience and good grades.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.080
We should have the cake tested.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.040
Most definitely.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.840
Are you mocking me?
You knew it wasn’t him!

14:28.280 --> 14:31.440
You gotta get some lumps of your own.
Other people’s lumps don’t hurt.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.000
-Right, Professor?
-Yes.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.480
Sorry to have interrupted.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.920
Devil knows what goes on in this place!

14:53.000 --> 14:54.640
Devil knows what.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.680
Hello, Andrei Sergeyevich.
Did you get here okay?

15:05.760 --> 15:08.560
You must have hit some traffic.
I was trying to meet somewhere close.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.360
Sasha, I don’t have much time.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.360
Okay.

15:15.160 --> 15:18.920
Andrei Sergeyevich,
I saw Esenya, and she’s changed a lot.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.680
I think this training isn’t good for her.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.600
Get to the point, Sasha.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.200
I know you want to get her back.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.120
I know how to do it.

15:34.920 --> 15:37.000
But I need your help.

15:37.080 --> 15:38.280
And?

15:39.640 --> 15:42.160
I need access to Zakharova’s case files.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.960
Anulya, our classmate.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.200
-Bon appétit.
-Thank you.

16:09.640 --> 16:13.000
We’ve been sitting here for three hours.
What for?

16:13.080 --> 16:17.720
I haven’t had a salad this horrific
since high school.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.200
-Wanna try some?
-No, thanks.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.360
No, thank you. I didn’t get any sleep.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.080
Mom was working the night shift,
and I had to babysit, so…

16:26.760 --> 16:29.200
Natashka woke up twice last night.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.480
She started screaming, “Where’s Mommy?”

16:32.920 --> 16:36.200
Then Maskimka joined in,
and they started bawling together.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.720
It took me an hour to put them to bed.

16:40.480 --> 16:43.400
Then I had to make them breakfast
in the morning,

16:43.480 --> 16:45.320
get them ready for school.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.040
I must have gotten 15 minutes of sleep.

16:49.120 --> 16:52.080
You think he’ll walk by
and you’ll smell him?

16:56.960 --> 16:58.440
Are you looking for his victim?

16:59.160 --> 16:59.960
No.

17:04.160 --> 17:07.040
I’m trying to understand
how he selects them.

17:07.119 --> 17:09.720
-And how?
-Thank you, girls, but I’m good.

17:28.640 --> 17:33.120
I need to stop by the pharmacy
after… after class.

17:33.960 --> 17:37.280
I have to make sure everyone
eats in the morning, their books are…

17:37.360 --> 17:40.120
And I need
to drop them both off at school.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.000
That’s crazy.

17:43.160 --> 17:46.040
You’re babysitting and studying.
It must be hard.

17:46.680 --> 17:49.080
-No, not really.
-Yeah, it’s hard.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.840
It’s hard being a big sister.
I know it firsthand.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.760
But it’ll make being a mom easier.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.320
-Bon appétit!
-Thank you!

18:05.840 --> 18:07.280
Who’s that?

18:07.360 --> 18:09.520
We saw him, remember? He came by.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.760
He seems cool.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.000
We should get his phone number.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.880
He doesn’t have a phone.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.240
Whatever.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.360
There’s no scopolamine in your cake.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.040
-Besides, it’s store-bought.
-So what?

18:32.800 --> 18:37.440
In the previous cases,
the cakes had a high yolk content.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.680
So he made the cakes too?

18:41.480 --> 18:43.560
Turns out he’s also a pastry chef.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.440
The victim’s parents are here.

18:49.040 --> 18:52.960
I’ll call them in about five minutes.
They’re with the psychologist right now.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.200
All right. I’m in no rush.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.240
Suchok! I mean--

18:57.840 --> 18:59.200
Lieutenant.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.920
-You--
-Captain.

19:03.640 --> 19:07.960
Right. The psychologist’s office--
don’t shut the door all the way.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.240
Okay?

19:10.960 --> 19:12.760
-Okay.
-Thank you.

19:30.720 --> 19:34.240
I know my words
aren’t going to bring Liza back,

19:34.880 --> 19:38.360
but you should be thinking about life
right now, not death.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.680
You have two young boys at home.

19:42.120 --> 19:45.400
If you give up now,
they will be the ones to suffer.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.440
I think Liza wouldn’t want that.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.920
She’d want you to remember her
but to go on living.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.080
Life goes on.

19:55.800 --> 19:59.760
Your life goes on,
and so do your kids’ lives.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.400
It’s okay. It’s okay.

20:03.480 --> 20:04.640
Yes.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.560
-Of course.
-Hush, hush.

20:14.440 --> 20:15.440
Yes.

20:19.480 --> 20:20.680
Hush, hush.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.520
Excuse me. Are you a doctor?

20:26.600 --> 20:27.600
-I’m not.
-Damn it!

20:27.680 --> 20:30.240
-What happened?
-There’s a baby. I thought--

20:30.320 --> 20:33.920
I came up to the car, something’s meowing.
I wanted to scare it off.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.680
Then I see a foundling, all blue.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.880
I pulled it out,
but I don’t know what to do.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.800
I’m not a doctor, but I know first aid.

20:39.880 --> 20:42.760
Thank you! It’s in the car. This way.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.200
-Is it still breathing?
-Yes.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.440
Where’s the baby?

20:45.520 --> 20:48.360
Quiet, quiet. Get over here.

20:49.480 --> 20:50.960
Quiet, psychologist.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.800
You were asking how you
get a woman into a car? Very easy.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.400
Tell her there’s a sick baby.
She’ll run to save it.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.800
No questions asked.
The instinct will kick in.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.800
A woman is a mother.
A mother is a victim. Got it?

21:03.400 --> 21:05.160
She got it. Let her go.

21:05.240 --> 21:08.520
This was a drill-- in extreme psychology.

21:08.600 --> 21:13.480
You should be more careful about giving
first aid to psychopaths you don’t know.

21:13.560 --> 21:14.880
Got it?

21:14.960 --> 21:17.560
And you should teach people to be careful.

21:17.640 --> 21:18.840
Get out of here.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.240
You pig!

21:25.680 --> 21:27.640
Sometimes I think I wanna kill you.

21:27.720 --> 21:32.080
Call Suchok. Find out how many brothers
and sisters the early victims had.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.800
Call. Go ahead.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.200
Why didn’t you say anything right away?

21:41.760 --> 21:43.440
This is what they had in common.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.120
You didn’t think?

21:48.160 --> 21:49.360
What got in the way?

21:50.120 --> 21:52.000
What got in the way of thinking?

21:53.960 --> 21:55.160
I see.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.200
They all came from large families.

22:00.280 --> 22:01.480
You knew that.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.320
How did you know?

22:04.240 --> 22:05.600
You need to ask the right question.

22:05.680 --> 22:08.280
It’s not how I knew, but what it means.
So?

22:08.920 --> 22:11.720
The killer is trying
to relive his childhood.

22:12.440 --> 22:14.440
Is he also from a large family?

22:15.680 --> 22:18.680
If Suchok said this, I’d understand,
but you…

22:19.440 --> 22:20.880
Keep thinking. So?

22:25.200 --> 22:27.920
A large family is like a pack.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.960
The common good
comes before self-interest.

22:31.040 --> 22:36.480
This is where good parents,
true friends, heroes,

22:36.560 --> 22:38.240
and victims of killers come from--

22:38.320 --> 22:41.440
that is, everyone who believes
in the goodness of people

22:41.520 --> 22:43.120
and helps their neighbor.

22:43.680 --> 22:44.680
So?

22:47.520 --> 22:52.240
So all the girls were brought up that way…

22:53.760 --> 22:55.560
and he used that?

22:57.400 --> 22:58.600
Yes.

23:00.360 --> 23:01.760
He doesn’t take risks.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.720
KOMSOMOLSKY PROSPEKT
CITY CENTER

23:21.120 --> 23:23.280
Natasha. My favorite girl.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.200
I haven’t seen you in a hundred years.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.120
-And I could go another hundred without.
-Really?

23:31.200 --> 23:32.400
Your latest?

23:32.480 --> 23:35.960
-Something like that.
-Not bad.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.520
-You think?
-Uh-huh.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.200
Why are you standing around? Go.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.120
Will you wait here?

23:43.760 --> 23:46.400
-I thought you were a blonde.
-I’m smarter now.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.520
-A cigarette?
-Will you go already?

23:52.000 --> 23:56.760
We all unfortunately know
that three students from our university

23:56.840 --> 23:58.600
became the victims of a serial killer.

23:59.760 --> 24:03.160
And today,
our guests from the competent authorities

24:03.840 --> 24:08.800
will talk to you about how to stay safe.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.480
The floor is yours.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.160
So, I want everyone to be quiet.

24:17.440 --> 24:18.480
Quieter.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.920
Today’s lecture--

24:21.760 --> 24:24.440
how to avoid becoming a victim
of a serial killer.

24:25.640 --> 24:28.200
Raise your hand
if you think you’re a victim.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.760
Don’t be shy.

24:38.280 --> 24:40.440
-No victims here, huh?
-No.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.440
But the person who’s hunting you
disagrees.

24:45.040 --> 24:49.200
He knows who the victims here are,
and his attacks aren’t random.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.200
So to avoid becoming his prey…

24:53.520 --> 24:56.120
you need to know two things
about the hunter:

24:57.320 --> 25:00.320
what he wants and what he’s afraid of.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.640
Sometimes the two are the same thing.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.080
Now, my assistant…

25:10.840 --> 25:13.920
will demonstrate what he wants.

25:15.040 --> 25:15.680
Natash.

25:21.480 --> 25:22.680
Come this way. Come on.

25:38.040 --> 25:38.920
What’s going on?

25:54.040 --> 25:55.080
Wow!

26:02.640 --> 26:04.760
I don’t understand what’s going on!

26:04.840 --> 26:06.800
-Please stop this immediately.
-Is that it?

26:06.880 --> 26:09.440
-That’s it.
-The lecture’s over. Thank you.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.480
Did you have fun?

26:16.240 --> 26:18.240
Should we go dancing sometime?

26:20.440 --> 26:21.640
Bye. Thank you!

26:22.280 --> 26:23.520
Is she one of yours?

26:23.600 --> 26:26.000
She sure is. One of ours.

26:26.080 --> 26:29.040
-An exhibitionist.
-No! That’s a rude word.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.000
Natasha is a beautiful young lady.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.920
So that’s your type.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.520
So, do you know who he is now?

26:37.240 --> 26:38.640
What about you?

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
-What do you want?
-What is it?

27:09.560 --> 27:11.720
-Olya, what do you want?
-What is it?

27:11.800 --> 27:13.000
What are you-- Hang on!

27:17.480 --> 27:18.200
Hang on.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.760
Everyone step back! Call Bergich!

28:19.600 --> 28:23.280
PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL No. 13

28:50.400 --> 28:52.440
Oneiroid syndrome.

28:55.840 --> 28:57.040
What’s that?

28:57.960 --> 28:59.360
Acute psychosis.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.200
-May I see him?
-Not right now.

29:10.760 --> 29:14.800
It might be unsafe for him…
as well as for you.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.160
He needs complete rest…

29:20.680 --> 29:22.000
and isolation.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
At least for a few days.

30:00.640 --> 30:03.280
FROM ZHENYA
I’M OUTSIDE. COME OUT.

30:19.240 --> 30:21.080
What are you doing here?

30:22.080 --> 30:23.280
Hi.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.480
I missed you too.

30:25.560 --> 30:27.200
How’d you find out about this place?

30:28.040 --> 30:29.840
Because I happen to be a detective.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.320
And not the worst one, I hope.

30:34.160 --> 30:36.440
They told me at the station
that Meglin had a stroke.

30:36.520 --> 30:37.520
Not true.

30:37.960 --> 30:40.200
He just-- Never mind.

30:40.280 --> 30:43.520
Listen, I was thinking…
You’re off today, you’re depressed.

30:46.280 --> 30:48.520
Let’s spend a night in a cloud of smoke
and a drunken haze.

30:49.040 --> 30:51.120
I’m your dealer of happiness for tonight.

30:51.200 --> 30:53.960
Then what the hell are friends for?
Let’s go.

30:54.040 --> 30:57.200
Zhenya, thank you for your kind concern,
but I have to work. So what you’re trying to say is that,
from that moment on,

31:09.840 --> 31:12.040
you conducted the investigation
on your own?

31:13.120 --> 31:14.360
No.

31:19.840 --> 31:21.240
How’d you do it then?

31:24.400 --> 31:26.560
Have you ever put together
a jigsaw puzzle?

31:26.960 --> 31:28.440
Let’s say I have.

31:29.040 --> 31:31.120
You think you’re painting the picture.

31:34.600 --> 31:36.600
Only it’s already been painted.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.520
You just need to put the pieces together.

31:43.080 --> 31:44.560
He gave them to me.

31:49.720 --> 31:51.600
<i>All the murdered girls…</i>

31:52.920 --> 31:55.360
<i>attended the same university.</i>

32:00.960 --> 32:02.560
Are you looking for his victim?

32:02.640 --> 32:06.080
I’m trying to understand
how he selects them.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.480
Thank you, girls, but I’m good.

32:08.560 --> 32:12.600
Mom was working the night shift.
I had to babysit, so…

32:12.680 --> 32:14.760
Yeah, it’s hard.

32:14.840 --> 32:18.040
It’s hard being a big sister.
I know it firsthand.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.680
But it’ll make being a mom easier.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.320
I don’t even know how to thank you.

33:22.400 --> 33:25.360
You opened it so effortlessly
and didn’t even break it.

33:26.520 --> 33:28.360
The lock is rubbish.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.200
-It’ll be 500 rubles.
-Sure.

33:40.280 --> 33:41.480
Thank you.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.720
<i>Datura.</i>

35:34.000 --> 35:37.240
It takes years to learn how to use it
to defend yourself.

35:37.320 --> 35:38.520
And we don’t have time.

35:39.400 --> 35:42.000
-Thank you for keeping it safe.
-Why aren’t you in the hospital?

35:42.600 --> 35:44.360
What am I supposed to do there?

35:44.440 --> 35:45.720
Here’s what I realized.

35:45.800 --> 35:48.560
If you figure out who he is,
you’ll go see him,

35:48.640 --> 35:50.640
and he’ll treat you to some cake.

35:51.200 --> 35:52.840
And I’ll never see my knife again.

35:52.920 --> 35:54.800
It has too many memories.

35:56.720 --> 35:59.800
How many times do I have to tell you?
Lock the door.

35:59.880 --> 36:00.880
Right away.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.080
I’ve already locked it.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.840
Yeah, I missed you too.

36:08.720 --> 36:11.800
I read that in ancient times,
they called this flower…

36:13.120 --> 36:14.640
angel’s trumpet.

36:14.720 --> 36:16.440
Did it say what kind of angel?

36:16.520 --> 36:17.960
The angel of death.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.560
Hey.

36:23.040 --> 36:23.960
What is it?

36:25.760 --> 36:27.320
Needle marks from a syringe.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.840
<i>So, in low doses, it suppresses willpower.</i>

36:34.960 --> 36:37.200
Moderate doses--
the victim loses consciousness.

36:37.280 --> 36:40.240
I wonder what it does
when used in high doses.

36:40.320 --> 36:45.120
When shamans simply wanted
not to kill the enemy, but to evoke fear,

36:45.200 --> 36:47.000
they used the sap of <i>Datura</i>.

36:47.080 --> 36:47.840
And?

36:47.920 --> 36:51.880
They believed that, on his deathbed,

36:51.960 --> 36:54.440
a person experiences such hallucinations
and suffers such agony

36:54.520 --> 36:57.800
that even the gods could not endure it.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.880
I wonder what kind of agony?

37:06.680 --> 37:08.120
I should see it for myself.

37:10.600 --> 37:11.800
I’m joking.

37:12.280 --> 37:16.640
I promised to bring some to Palych.
He’s an enthusiast of rare poisons.

37:18.200 --> 37:22.040
Why do you have morphine in the car?
Are you also a drug addict?

37:22.120 --> 37:23.840
What do you mean by “also”?

37:24.840 --> 37:26.760
And why are you interrogating me?

37:29.800 --> 37:31.000
What do you see?

37:49.480 --> 37:51.040
This is his mother’s room.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.920
She died,
but the room’s exactly the same way.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.200
Go on.

38:01.080 --> 38:03.000
Some books were read more than others.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.000
She was a teacher.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.280
He grew up without a father.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.160
-What about the father?
-He either died or left them.

38:24.240 --> 38:26.200
Did he die, or did he leave?

38:28.200 --> 38:29.680
The armchair.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.080
The armchair?

38:31.960 --> 38:34.280
She’d put out rarely and reluctantly.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.080
He stopped sleeping in the same bed.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.080
He bought himself an armchair.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.680
He lived in it,
and then, one day, he just left.

38:44.760 --> 38:46.320
And she found herself alone.

38:47.920 --> 38:51.960
She was just like that with her son.
Everything to do with sex was taboo.

38:52.840 --> 38:55.760
All the women were undressed
but not raped, because the mother was all buttoned-up.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.840
-Was he impotent?
-No.

39:03.560 --> 39:07.080
Was nudity like sex for him?
Simply seeing a naked woman…

39:08.160 --> 39:09.360
That’s right.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.600
I think the first girl
laughed really hard.

39:13.600 --> 39:16.920
He’d just get the rest of them drunk
so they wouldn’t remember anything.

39:17.760 --> 39:23.920
He kept working this way until he learned
there’s a science called botany.

39:24.920 --> 39:28.400
This is the only way
he ever pictured a woman.

40:03.200 --> 40:08.120
<i>He decided to become a psychologist</i>
<i>so he could learn about himself.</i>

40:08.200 --> 40:12.120
<i>And he learned-- only not about himself</i>
<i>but about the psychology of victims.</i>

40:14.080 --> 40:19.400
The girls he selected
were potentially ready for that.

40:19.480 --> 40:22.200
How did he… lure them?

40:23.200 --> 40:25.480
A girl from a large family

40:25.560 --> 40:28.560
is used to sacrificing herself
for her younger siblings.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.840
Being a victim is also a habit.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.320
He didn’t lure them.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.520
-He simply asked for help.
-Help with what?

40:35.600 --> 40:39.160
With what they know best-- watching kids.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.280
He has no kids. I checked.

40:52.240 --> 40:54.640
Do you want to see the second room?

40:55.600 --> 40:58.240
If I’m wrong, this is yours.

41:21.320 --> 41:22.720
“The kids are asleep.

41:23.520 --> 41:26.560
How about tea and some cake?”

41:39.160 --> 41:40.600
We can’t just sit here.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.120
We know everything. We have to arrest him.

41:47.640 --> 41:49.040
Or are you a sadist?

41:50.680 --> 41:52.600
Do you get pleasure from torture?

41:53.120 --> 41:54.320
What do you think?

41:56.600 --> 41:58.640
Here they are.

44:04.160 --> 44:06.240
What do you want? Leave me alone!

44:07.200 --> 44:09.120
-Come back here!
-Leave me alone!

44:09.200 --> 44:12.040
-Come back here!
-What do you want?

44:14.800 --> 44:16.000
What do you want?

44:16.080 --> 44:17.960
Please don’t hit me! Please!

44:18.680 --> 44:20.080
-Come here!
-Please don’t!

44:23.160 --> 44:24.240
You animal--

44:30.880 --> 44:33.920
Hey, man! Hey! What are you doing, huh?

44:35.000 --> 44:36.200
That’s enough!

44:37.240 --> 44:38.840
What are you doing?

44:40.360 --> 44:41.760
You got a smoke?

44:48.920 --> 44:50.800
I have a question for you.

44:51.920 --> 44:55.640
You ate the cake with them so that
they wouldn’t suspect anything, right?

44:57.040 --> 44:58.080
How?

44:58.600 --> 45:02.560
A little bit at a time…
for two years… with food…

45:03.200 --> 45:04.840
There you go.

45:04.920 --> 45:07.480
You built up an immunity to the toxin.

45:09.160 --> 45:10.560
That’s good.

45:12.040 --> 45:15.480
Didn’t you want to die?
Why didn’t you kill yourself?

45:15.560 --> 45:17.800
I’m very sorry. I won’t do it again.

45:17.880 --> 45:21.080
I’m sorry. I… I swear on my life.

45:23.080 --> 45:24.200
Let’s go to work, huh?

45:24.280 --> 45:25.800
Don’t!

45:25.880 --> 45:26.920
Please don’t!

45:27.000 --> 45:29.680
I have a daughter, too, you animal.

45:29.760 --> 45:32.360
Labor changed apes into slaves.
Let’s go.

45:34.320 --> 45:36.680
Go ahead. But slowly.

45:36.760 --> 45:39.520
Don’t tear him apart right away.
You’ll spoil all the fun.

45:44.840 --> 45:46.520
Don’t!

45:46.600 --> 45:50.680
Stop! I’m begging you! Stop!
You can’t do this!

45:50.760 --> 45:53.920
Haven’t you heard them-- saying
how they’ll repent, how they want to live?

45:55.760 --> 45:57.840
Tell her how much you want to live.

45:57.920 --> 45:59.760
She’ll believe you. She’s kindhearted.

46:01.760 --> 46:04.480
I’m sorry.
I’ll atone for this my entire life.

46:04.560 --> 46:07.520
I’ll atone with my whole life!
With my whole life--

46:07.600 --> 46:10.400
Did you hear that?
He’ll atone with his life.

46:10.480 --> 46:12.040
Come on, let him go.

46:12.120 --> 46:13.120
Cut the ropes.

46:15.400 --> 46:17.720
He’ll be laughing at you later.

46:17.800 --> 46:20.960
I was once foolish enough
to let someone go.

46:21.040 --> 46:23.640
He swore to God, pleaded.

46:23.720 --> 46:25.360
I believed him and let him go.

46:25.960 --> 46:27.800
He killed two more within the week.

46:27.880 --> 46:30.680
That’s why I believe
in only one atonement-- that of blood.

46:30.760 --> 46:31.760
Here and now.

46:31.840 --> 46:34.000
Don’t! Please… don’t!

46:38.120 --> 46:39.920
I can’t have this on my conscience.

46:43.120 --> 46:44.320
And I can?

46:48.880 --> 46:50.520
Don’t you dare!

46:51.680 --> 46:53.080
No!

47:21.040 --> 47:22.040
Captain.

47:26.280 --> 47:27.480
I just need a minute.

47:28.600 --> 47:30.840
You’re lucky.

47:31.920 --> 47:33.120
She has a good heart.

47:40.520 --> 47:42.000
We need a doctor! Now!

47:42.600 --> 47:44.040
Now!

47:45.080 --> 47:46.640
We need a doctor here!

47:47.160 --> 47:49.560
Get out of the way! Step back!

47:50.160 --> 47:51.360
Let’s go.

47:55.800 --> 47:57.200
Do something!

47:58.680 --> 48:00.680
Everyone step back! Step back!

48:14.000 --> 48:15.840
Maybe you can tell me where we’re going.

48:16.720 --> 48:20.440
That pistol in your mother’s case--
do you want to meet its owner?

48:20.520 --> 48:22.240
Is he alive?

48:22.320 --> 48:23.800
Are we going to see him?

48:25.240 --> 48:27.120
Can you just answer me?

48:29.160 --> 48:31.560
You must be trying to say thank you.
Am I right?

48:36.280 --> 48:37.480
Thank you.

48:37.560 --> 48:39.080
What are you so happy about?

48:39.160 --> 48:41.560
I’ve looked for him in every database.
Nothing.

48:41.640 --> 48:44.760
It seemed Ognarev just vanished,
as if he never existed.

48:45.640 --> 48:48.120
-How’d you find him?
-The same way I found you.

48:48.200 --> 48:50.640
-I think I found you.
-You dreamt it.

48:50.720 --> 48:51.960
Stop!

48:54.040 --> 48:55.320
Here’s Ognarev.

48:56.720 --> 48:57.520
Don’t.

48:59.680 --> 49:01.280
We want to talk.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.480
Like you talked to them?

49:04.200 --> 49:06.240
To talk? Yeah?

49:06.320 --> 49:08.440
No! You’re not gonna take me!

49:09.040 --> 49:10.600
Put the rifle down!

49:10.680 --> 49:12.760
We’re just gonna ask
a couple of questions.

49:13.240 --> 49:14.360
Put it down! No!

49:16.160 --> 49:16.960
Rodion!

49:22.480 --> 49:24.400
-Are you okay?
-He’s a bad shot.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
WHAT’S NEXT? - OPINION POLL

50:24.080 --> 50:27.000
IMMIGRANT SCUM - ELECTED OFFICIALS
GAYS - A DUMB SLUT

50:27.080 --> 50:30.080
