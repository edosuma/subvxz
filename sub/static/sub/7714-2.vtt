You wanted to see me?

00:04.004 --> 00:07.506
Yes, Oscar, come on in.
Close the door if you would.

00:08.174 --> 00:10.009
Thank you.
Thanks so much
for talking to me.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.093
Yeah, sure.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.512
(SlGHS) l'm going in
for a procedure today.

00:13.596 --> 00:15.514
ls everything okay?
Yeah.

00:15.598 --> 00:17.808
lt's routine. l'm just
a little bit scared.

00:17.892 --> 00:20.561
l'm sure everything
will be fine.

00:20.645 --> 00:23.147
What's the procedure,
if you don't mind my asking?

00:23.231 --> 00:24.815
lt is a colonoscopy.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.442
Okay.

00:27.944 --> 00:30.487
ln your experience,
what should l be expecting

00:30.572 --> 00:34.825
in terms of sensation
or emotions?

00:42.792 --> 00:47.129
ls there anything
l can do to make it more
pleasurable for me,

00:47.213 --> 00:48.964
or for Dr. Chaudry?

00:50.967 --> 00:52.051
(SlGHS) Oh, my God !

00:52.135 --> 00:54.344
My main concern,
should l have
a safe word?

00:54.471 --> 00:55.679
Yeah.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.730
(lNAUDlBLE)

01:17.452 --> 01:18.786
So, Michael,
you think you can
give me a rundown

01:18.870 --> 01:20.496
on the Buffalo
clients by Monday?

01:20.580 --> 01:22.539
Absolutely. You know what?
l'll do you one better.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.124
Sunday. Sunday night.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.709
Okay. l will
get it Monday.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.461
(CHUCKLES)
Hold on, big guy.

01:27.545 --> 01:30.047
l'm going to put it
in the mail Sunday night,
you'll get it Wednesday.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.007
Okay. Jim, you want to
hit the conference room?

01:32.092 --> 01:33.092
Sure.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.176
Hey, good luck.

01:34.385 --> 01:36.595
Oh, right, this thing.
l remember now.

01:36.679 --> 01:37.763
(WHlSPERlNG)
What's this about?

01:37.847 --> 01:39.431
This is just
me and David,
if that's okay.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.058
lt's okay with me.
He's going to
want me in there.

01:41.142 --> 01:43.519
No. lt's okay,
Michael. We got it.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.104
Really?
Yeah.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.356
All right. Do you mind
if l sit this out?

01:47.440 --> 01:51.276
l have so much work to do,
l feel like l'm going
to blow my brains out.

Okay. You got it.

01:58.535 --> 01:59.952
(DOOR SHUTS)

02:00.495 --> 02:03.872
Am l worried that
Jim and David are having
a meeting without me?

02:03.957 --> 02:07.668
No. Because we are
the three amigos.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.586
And once in a while,

02:09.671 --> 02:13.090
one of the amigos
will go off
to the bathroom,

02:13.174 --> 02:16.009
while the other two
have a secret meeting.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.017
Hey, let me
escort you
to your desk.

02:24.102 --> 02:27.521
Okay. lt's just
three or four steps,
but thank you.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.815
Thank you.
You and Jim
are close, huh?

02:29.899 --> 02:33.068
Yeah. l think the pregnancy
really brought us together.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.071
Hey, what do you
think he and David
are talking about?

02:36.156 --> 02:37.281
What do you. . .

02:37.365 --> 02:38.657
Um, l don't know.

02:38.741 --> 02:40.993
MlCHAEL: Well, you said
good luck to Jim
as he walked in.

02:41.077 --> 02:44.746
Did l?
Doesn't sound like me.
Not very superstitious.

to me right now,

come out a liar.

They inherit things
through the breast milk.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.931
Please don't talk
about my breast milk.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.392
l just don't want
you to lie to me.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.645
l don't want you
to ever lie to me.
Have l ever lied to you?

03:08.730 --> 03:09.688
Yeah.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.356
l just don't
want you to.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.192
DARRYL: l was rushing
to fill an order.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.695
l put the ladder up to grab
a box of three hole
from the top shelf,

next thing l know,
l'm on the ground,
ladder's on top of me.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.699
And that's how you
broke your ankle?

03:20.783 --> 03:21.909
Yes.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.952
Hmm. lnteresting.

03:24.037 --> 03:28.081
How did the ladder
end up on top of you
if you fell off of it?

03:28.166 --> 03:30.459
This doesn't concern you, man.
You need to walk away.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.794
Oh, really?
l'm sorry. l thought
this was a free country.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.963
l didn't know we were
in Communist Sweden.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.089
lf we were
living in Sweden,

03:36.174 --> 03:37.174
l wouldn't have
to worry about this

03:37.258 --> 03:39.176
because we'd have
universal healthcare.

03:39.928 --> 03:40.928
That's not. . . Okay.

l will send this
off to corporate.

Make sure you hold on
to your medical bills.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.646
Thanks, T-man. Later.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.234
So long, Darryl.
Feel better.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.902
He's lying.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.237
He has a doctor's note.

03:58.363 --> 04:02.407
From who? Dr. J?
You really need to
investigate this.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.409
People don't just
fall off of ladders.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.869
Guy on my street
fell off a ladder

04:05.954 --> 04:07.537
painting his house.
lt was on the news.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.415
Since when
have you known Darryl
to rush to do anything

04:10.500 --> 04:12.918
other than to come up here
for birthday cake?

04:13.002 --> 04:15.170
"Y'all having
birthday cake?"
(SCOFFS)

04:15.296 --> 04:16.588
That's not
a very good Darryl.
Please!

And how many
foremen do you know
that pull boxes?

04:21.469 --> 04:23.637
lt just doesn't add up.

we did a little investigation,
and Dwight had a good point.

04:29.394 --> 04:33.146
The Iadder
didn't reach the top shelf.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.191

like it, you can tell
that s.o.b that he is fired.

Sorry, l'm going
into a meeting right now.
l will. l love you, too. Bye.

04:47.954 --> 04:48.954
Who was that?

04:49.038 --> 04:50.789
Sorry about that.
What'd l miss?

04:50.873 --> 04:53.292
Michael, we would like
to continue the rest of
this meeting in private,

if you don't mind.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.711
l do not mind.

Yes, l do.
No, l don't. Yes, l do.
No, l don't mind.

he just lost six votes.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.141

in there a while.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.059
Yeah.
Can't be good.

05:11.686 --> 05:12.769
No.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.229
Think they're
talking about me?

05:14.856 --> 05:17.316
No, l think they're
talking about me.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.694
Yeah. That makes
way more sense.
Okay. Thanks, boss.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.488
MlCHAEL: What is
Jim telling him?
That I can't handle this job?

05:23.573 --> 05:25.699
That's bull crap.
That is bull crap.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.494
Although it has been
chaotic lately.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.663
Corporate shut down
the Buffalo branch,

05:31.748 --> 05:35.000
which left us to absorb
all of their clients.

05:35.084 --> 05:39.004
I will tell you,
there has been
work every day.

05:39.088 --> 05:41.214

on a Saturday

05:42.091 --> 05:45.385

my cell phone here.

Hey, Kelly.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.932
(SlGHS) So jealous
of your boobs.

05:51.768 --> 05:52.976
Thank you.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.395
Um, listen,
l just wanted
to confirm

05:55.480 --> 05:57.564
that you're not
coming to the wedding,

05:57.648 --> 06:01.068
which is totally
understandable,
and more than fine.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.319
ls Ryan going?

06:02.403 --> 06:04.321
l don't know,
he hasn't RSVPed yet.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.823
We invited everyone
in the office
to our wedding,

06:06.908 --> 06:08.450
even though
we realized
most people

06:08.534 --> 06:11.787
wouldn't be able
to make the drive
to Niagara Falls.

06:12.163 --> 06:15.332
(WHlSPERlNG) Which is why
we're having it
in Niagara Falls.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.918
Then Michael
told everyone

06:18.002 --> 06:21.463
they could have
Friday and Monday
off if they came.

06:21.547 --> 06:25.384
So now, people have
to decide if they want
to come to our wedding

06:25.468 --> 06:27.469
or have to work.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.638
Here's the deal.
l really want to go.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.515
But l'm not gonna go
if Ryan doesn't go,

06:31.599 --> 06:33.683
because it's kind of
a waste of time.

06:33.768 --> 06:34.893
That came out wrong.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.603
lt would be awesome
if you could try
to get him to go

to be there to support Jim.

are down a little bit.

of the economy.

trouble focusing lately.

of preparing for you

From the Wisconsin region,
a nice, firm cheddar.

08:23.085 --> 08:26.922
Also from the great
state of Wisconsin,
an aged Parmesan.

08:27.423 --> 08:30.175
Here you will find
a cheddar-style spread,

08:30.259 --> 08:34.346

nicely with the air
to form a light rind,

08:34.430 --> 08:37.015
which l think you'll find both
challenging and delicious.

At that point, l would
recommend you take

08:39.101 --> 08:42.145
a quick trip
south of the border to
the great state of lllinois,

08:42.230 --> 08:45.190
where you will find
this fine blue
cheese dressing.

lf l may be so bold,

08:47.026 --> 08:49.819

in the blue cheese.

a run-of-the-mill
slaughterhouse,

09:59.849 --> 10:00.807
but sure, anytime.

10:00.891 --> 10:03.226
Well, you know,
because of the trains.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.145
Wait, someone's coming.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.606
lt's Darryl ! Get down !
He's not using crutches!

10:07.690 --> 10:09.274
Get the camera.
Start taping.

10:09.358 --> 10:10.400
Drive!

10:10.484 --> 10:12.319
Worker's comp, my ass!

10:12.403 --> 10:14.029
l can't believe this.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.280
Hey, you ass (BLEEP) !

10:15.364 --> 10:16.364
Toby!

10:16.449 --> 10:19.200
TOBY: You gonna eat all
that dog food yourself?

10:20.286 --> 10:22.412
No, no!

10:23.623 --> 10:24.914
Oh, man !
You okay?

10:24.999 --> 10:26.041
Just drive.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.631
Hey, Ryan.
Hey.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.634
So, l just wanted to
confirm that you're not
coming to my wedding.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.802
Yeah, l might stop by.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.888
lt costs about
$75 per person.

10:39.972 --> 10:43.475
Okay. l once had
a glass of Cognac
that cost $77, so. . .

10:43.559 --> 10:46.561
Can you just tell me now
if you're coming or not?

10:47.063 --> 10:49.814
Yes. l'm coming
to your wedding.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.816
Okay. Ryan Howard, yes.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.485
Probably yes.

10:53.569 --> 10:55.236
Kelly Kapoor, yes.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.740
Are you sure you're
okay with these new
responsibilities?

10:58.824 --> 11:00.033
Look who you're talking to.

11:00.117 --> 11:03.828
Just trying to figure out
the best way to utilize
everyone's talents.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.997
Well, l would say
that my greatest talent

11:06.082 --> 11:09.459
is being the best
man, woman or child

11:09.543 --> 11:11.169
to have ever run
this branch. Ever.

11:11.253 --> 11:12.253
And what about Jim?

11:12.338 --> 11:13.838
You think Jim is
someone who is ready

11:13.923 --> 11:16.633
to move into
a management position?

11:21.639 --> 11:23.348
Permission to speak
on the record.

11:23.432 --> 11:24.724
Please do.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.811
Jim is like Big Bird.

11:27.895 --> 11:32.232
He is tall and yellow
and very nice.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.734
But would l put him
in charge? No.

11:35.277 --> 11:39.698
l don't think so. He. . .
Big Bird doesn't make
the tough decisions.

11:40.574 --> 11:44.619
lf l was going to put
someone in charge,
l would put Bert in charge.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.579
Or l would put
one of the real
grownups in charge,

11:46.664 --> 11:47.706
like Maria.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.082
Or Gordon, maybe.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.333
l thought you liked Jim.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.669
Very much.
Jim is my best friend.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.505
But here's his
performance report.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.925
Right here.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.803
Now, this was
written by Toby,

12:01.887 --> 12:05.265
who we all know is
extremely reliable.

12:05.933 --> 12:09.561
"Constant office distraction.
Spends way too much
time at reception.

12:09.645 --> 12:12.897
"Antagonizes other salesmen.
Not at all what
he thinks he is."

12:12.982 --> 12:16.109
lt's not very well written.
But you get the gist.

12:16.193 --> 12:19.571
ls there anybody else
you think could run the
day-to-day of the branch?

12:19.655 --> 12:21.781
l could just continue
to run it myself, that's. . .

12:21.866 --> 12:25.660
Jim had an interesting
idea to help you with
this extra workload.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.746
And it involved
you being promoted

12:27.830 --> 12:30.206
to oversee all
northeast sales.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.376
And then Jim
would be promoted
to your position.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.130
This was Jim's idea?

12:37.214 --> 12:38.214
Mmm-hmm.

12:39.383 --> 12:40.675
Wow!

12:43.220 --> 12:49.184
Well, l'd have to talk
to my mother and my guy
at H&R Block.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.938
Okay. But, well, see,
here's the thing, though.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.565
The plan doesn't work

12:55.649 --> 12:58.318
unless we have
someone to replace you.
l was hoping. . .

12:59.445 --> 13:02.655
Plus, we have to
worry about Jim.
He has another job offer.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.949
We may have to replace him.

13:05.034 --> 13:08.828
l didn't tell Michael because
l thought he'd try to help.

13:09.789 --> 13:14.000
Example, he handed out
Jell-O shots at the 23rd mile
of the Steamtown Marathon.

13:17.087 --> 13:19.297
Jim, can you walk me down
to my car for a second?

13:19.381 --> 13:20.548
Sure.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.186
(lNAUDlBLE)

13:42.112 --> 13:45.573
l can't help but feel
partially responsible.

13:54.083 --> 13:58.795
Little pick-me-up.
Those are the best.
Sugar rush.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.339
When you were in
the office earlier
talking to Wallace,

14:01.423 --> 14:03.550
did l come up at all?

14:04.885 --> 14:07.679
Well, we did talk about
how handsome you are.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.097
Why don't we head into
your office and talk?

14:09.181 --> 14:12.809
MlCHAEL:
Okay. What did we. . .
God ! We said. . .

14:13.602 --> 14:16.521
l know
there were certain
things we said.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.690
Michael, look.
l'll just be honest with you.

14:18.774 --> 14:21.609
Earlier today, l spoke with
Wallace about a promotion.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.236
And l actually think
that talk went really well.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.362
Mmm-hmm.

14:24.446 --> 14:25.738
And then,
after he spoke with you,

14:25.823 --> 14:28.366
for some reason,
it felt like
things had changed.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.827
Hmm. That's weird.
That's weird.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.538
Kind of weirding me out.

14:33.622 --> 14:36.374
Did you know that
Lincoln's secretary
was named Kennedy?

14:36.458 --> 14:38.793
Michael,
did you say anything?

14:39.128 --> 14:41.796
(SlGHS) Tell you what,
when you leave this office,

14:41.881 --> 14:44.007
l'm going to call Wallace
and l'm going to tell him

14:44.091 --> 14:45.842
that you should
get that promotion.

14:45.926 --> 14:47.010
Really?
Yes.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.469
You will?
Yes.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.054
Wanna do it right now?

14:50.139 --> 14:51.139
Yes.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.976
l tried to keep
Michael in the dark.

14:56.645 --> 15:00.732
l should have known
that he can do just as much
damage in the dark.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.233
l need to see
your pupils.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.735
l have to see if
they're dilating. . .

15:03.819 --> 15:05.528
STANLEY: Toby! Dwight!

15:06.488 --> 15:07.739
ls that them?

15:07.823 --> 15:08.990
Definitely.

15:10.117 --> 15:13.077
You come to my house,
bust up my trash cans,

15:13.162 --> 15:16.039
call my baby sister
an ass (BLEEP) and
told her to eat dog food?

15:16.123 --> 15:17.790
We thought that
she was you.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.084
Why would you think
a lady is me?

15:23.797 --> 15:28.301
Are you serious?
Because you look
exactly alike.

15:28.385 --> 15:29.594
Am l the only one?
TOBY: That's too far. . .

15:29.678 --> 15:31.512
Are you getting this?
l mean. . .

15:31.597 --> 15:32.597
l don't see it.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.432
Here's what
l'm gonna do.

15:34.516 --> 15:37.977
l'm calling corporate
and l'm filing a complaint
against both of you.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.270
Oh, Darryl.

15:39.355 --> 15:40.521
Come on, Gwyneth.

15:41.857 --> 15:42.899
Sad.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.944
This is David.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.780
Hey, David,
this is Michael. . .

15:50.157 --> 15:51.616
Michael Scott here.
Yeah.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.952
Just wanted
to talk to you
about Jim Halpert.

15:54.036 --> 15:58.081
l understand
that he did not
receive that promotion,

15:58.165 --> 16:00.124
and l wanted to see
what l could do

16:00.209 --> 16:02.585
to nudge you
in the right
direction.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.797
So, what,
you're changing
your mind about Jim?

16:05.881 --> 16:10.468
Absolutely not!
Like l said before,

16:10.552 --> 16:14.055
Jim is fantastic
and he deserves this job.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.308
Michael, it seems like
you're cutting in and out.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.353
This is not what
you said earlier.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.063
What. . . Here's the thing.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.649
Jim is the best
man for this job.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.025
l think you should
give it to him.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.361
Well, it doesn't change
what you showed me
in Jim's fiIe.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.821
What?
Well. . .

16:30.906 --> 16:33.324
That was an anomaly.

16:33.993 --> 16:39.664
That file had been falsified.
Toby Flenderson
is doing drugs.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.666
Michael, I really
don't know what's
going on down there, but...

16:41.750 --> 16:42.709
(POLlCE SlREN WAlLlNG)

16:42.793 --> 16:44.335
Oh, damn it!

16:44.420 --> 16:47.964
I am getting pulled over
for talking on my cell.
Damn it!

16:51.760 --> 16:56.180
Hey, Darryl, look,
we're here to apologize.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.473
We're cool.
DWlGHT: Wait.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.767
They're using the lift
as their own personal
elevator.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.436
STANLEY: What?
He broke his ankle

17:01.520 --> 17:03.604
climbing over the railing,
then he lied about it

17:03.689 --> 17:06.441
because it was a misuse
of company equipment.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.026
Case closed.

17:08.110 --> 17:09.527
Stupidest thing
l ever heard.

17:09.611 --> 17:13.448
Really?
Then why is there new wood
only on one railing?

17:14.658 --> 17:17.368
Let's just check
the security tapes, Toby.

17:18.203 --> 17:21.247
Well, you know,
l don't think there's
any reason to check them,

17:21.331 --> 17:24.542
but l suppose
if we wanted to be
really certain.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.878
All right. Yeah.
Fine, so whatever.

17:26.962 --> 17:27.920
Yes!

17:28.005 --> 17:29.213
TOBY: You really did it.

17:29.298 --> 17:33.009
Now, l would like
to file an official
complaint to corporate

17:33.093 --> 17:36.471
because Darryl lied
on an official form.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.098
And l'm telling them
you guys sexually
harassed my sister.

17:39.183 --> 17:42.435
(SCOFFS) No judge
is gonna believe that.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.189
Okay.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.192
Look, we could
all file complaints
against each other

17:49.276 --> 17:52.028
and just drown in a sea
of paperwork, but,

17:52.112 --> 17:55.323
you know, we'll just
move on with our lives.

17:56.575 --> 18:01.454
So, Dwight and Darryl
came to an agreement
that they would both file

18:01.538 --> 18:03.081
complaints
with corporate,

18:03.165 --> 18:05.792
and now l get to do
all this paperwork.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.795
We worked it out.

18:11.673 --> 18:14.801
Hey, hey, Jim.
lt would make me feel
really good right now

18:14.885 --> 18:18.262
if you would just
punch me in the face,
all right? Just do it.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.806
How many times
have l asked you

18:19.890 --> 18:21.349
to put me up for
a branch manager job?

18:21.433 --> 18:24.393
l never recommended you
because l didn't
want to lose you.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.104
And l didn't
want to lose Pam.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.772
Now l don't want
to lose the baby.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.732
So, instead,
you screwed me?

18:29.817 --> 18:31.859
That's what she said.
No.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.028
David Wallace
is calling.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.238
We're kind of
in the middle
of something here.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.280
Should l tell him
you'll call back?

18:36.365 --> 18:39.575
Yeah. No.
l'll tell him myself.

18:40.035 --> 18:41.536
Let's both.

18:45.749 --> 18:46.749
Hello?

18:46.834 --> 18:48.042
DAVID: Hey, Michael.
Yes.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.293
You got Jim
there with you?

18:49.378 --> 18:50.795
No, it's just us.

18:50.879 --> 18:53.756
Actually, can you call Jim in?
I want him on this. PIease.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.425
Oh ! Well, here
he is right now.

18:57.719 --> 18:58.928
Come in.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.680
(CLlCKlNG TONGUE)

19:00.764 --> 19:02.265
(lMlTATlNG DOOR SQUEAKlNG)

19:05.018 --> 19:06.477
Hi, David.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.397
Hey, guys.
So, I spoke to AIan.

19:09.481 --> 19:12.942
We had kind of
an unconventional idea,
which I think is pretty cool.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.570
But it only works if
everyone's onboard.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.322
Well, just as long
as it means Jim
becomes a manager.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.659
We were thinking
of having two branch
managers in Scranton.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.162
Both of you guys
working as co-managers.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.621
Jim wouId handIe
the day-to-day,

19:25.706 --> 19:29.041
and Michael, you would
focus on cIients
and big picture stuff.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.334
Wow!
That sounds pretty cool.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.669
l like that!

19:31.753 --> 19:33.504
So, manager
and co-manager.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.673
Co-manager and co-manager.

19:35.757 --> 19:37.258
See, there are a lot
of moving pieces

19:37.342 --> 19:39.677
and this is the only way
I can sell it upstairs.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.512
Well, that might be
a little confusing
for people

19:41.597 --> 19:43.764
because they
know me as manager.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.768
All right, hey, Michael,
can you pick up
for one second?

19:48.437 --> 19:51.189
Okay, Iook, I'm not
going to force you
into anything.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.441
If you're willing
to lose Jim, fine.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.611
You just say so.
We'II find another
soIution. Okay?

19:57.529 --> 19:59.614
Is that what
you want to do?

20:06.163 --> 20:07.788
Okay, people, listen up!
MlCHAEL: Okay, everybody.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.832
BOTH: l have
an announcement
to make.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.167
Fraud was
committed in. . .
Whoa!

20:11.251 --> 20:12.210
Do you have
an announcement?

20:12.294 --> 20:13.669
l was making it.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.547
Everybody,
David Wallace
and l have talked,

20:16.632 --> 20:20.635
and we have decided
to promote Jim to the
position of co-manager.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.470
Co-manager of what?

20:22.554 --> 20:24.388
Of your butt!

20:25.057 --> 20:28.976
