02:08.239 --> 02:10.973
The Schroeders brought this
all the way from Germany.

02:11.008 --> 02:13.810
So, shouldn't we be saving
that for when Daddy's back?

02:13.845 --> 02:15.912
Your father is more
of a whiskey man, Eli.

02:18.683 --> 02:20.283
Don't be reading at the table.

02:20.318 --> 02:21.651
I'm not reading.

02:21.686 --> 02:23.352
Don't be scribbling
at the table, either.

02:23.388 --> 02:25.855
He's writing a letter
to Ralph Waldo Emerson.

02:25.890 --> 02:28.691
Who names a child Waldo?

02:28.726 --> 02:32.295
Mother, is Eli really your son,
or did you steal him from a zoo?

02:33.898 --> 02:35.531
You're not funny.

02:35.567 --> 02:37.600
I thought it was funny.

03:04.128 --> 03:06.262
It's probably a coyote.

03:20.812 --> 03:21.811
Indians.

03:26.050 --> 03:29.118
Is your gun loaded, Martin?

03:29.153 --> 03:31.120
Get your gun.

03:39.130 --> 03:41.430
There's about a dozen of
them out there... maybe more.

03:41.466 --> 03:43.099
Momma, get away from that door.

03:43.134 --> 03:45.234
That's the first place
they're gonna start shootin'.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.738
Put that down and get
your rifle primed now.

Eli, put that rifle on the floor!

03:53.444 --> 03:55.044
If we give them a
fight, they'll kill us!

03:55.079 --> 03:56.445
They're gonna kill us anyway, Momma.

03:56.447 --> 03:57.880
No, not you three. You're young.

03:57.916 --> 03:59.548
They'll want you as captives.

04:01.419 --> 04:02.451
Momma.

04:02.487 --> 04:04.987
I love you all very much.

04:11.829 --> 04:13.095
Momma, no.

04:34.152 --> 04:35.818
Get that door shut!

05:23.935 --> 05:26.002
Eli!

05:26.037 --> 05:28.070
Eli!

05:28.106 --> 05:29.572
No!

05:29.607 --> 05:31.707
No! No!

05:31.743 --> 05:34.477
Help me!

05:57.869 --> 06:00.002
I thought you were dead.

06:00.038 --> 06:02.104
I was watching you for a long time.

06:05.143 --> 06:07.676
Did you see what they
did to Momma and Lizzie?

_

07:37.389 --> 07:41.249
_

07:42.740 --> 07:43.939
Leave it for the sheriff.

07:43.975 --> 07:46.675
I mean, what're you gonna do,
put him in the back of your truck?

07:46.711 --> 07:48.371
Your daughter's there,
for Christ's sakes.

07:48.374 --> 07:49.979
Exactly. I don't want
her thinking McCulloughs

07:49.981 --> 07:51.647
are the kind of people
who drive by a dead man

07:51.649 --> 07:53.115
and leave him hangin' in the sun.

08:05.163 --> 08:07.196
C'mon, darlin'.

08:07.231 --> 08:09.965
Come on, now.

08:10.001 --> 08:11.467
Leave that.

08:11.502 --> 08:12.331
Let's go.

08:12.334 --> 08:14.603
You can keep your granddad company.

08:22.648 --> 08:24.114
Endive.

08:24.150 --> 08:25.783
Mm-hmm.

08:31.490 --> 08:33.090
Mexican hat.

08:33.125 --> 08:34.857
Good girl.

08:34.894 --> 08:36.592
You're giving me easy ones.

09:04.690 --> 09:08.158
You wanna know what's
happening, don't you?

09:08.194 --> 09:10.694
I know you're not gonna tell me.

09:19.133 --> 09:20.504
Indian blanket.

09:20.507 --> 09:21.472
Good girl.

09:27.613 --> 09:29.513
You missed a spot.

09:29.548 --> 09:31.148
Who do you figure for it?

09:31.183 --> 09:33.750
Well, hell, Pete, I dunno.

09:33.786 --> 09:35.319
Though there is a revolution goin' on

09:35.354 --> 09:37.754
the other side of
that border over there.

09:37.790 --> 09:38.989
And our county does harbor

09:39.024 --> 09:41.292
every type of cattle thief known to man.

09:41.325 --> 09:43.792
Then we got the trigger-happy Rangers,

09:43.828 --> 09:46.262
a sheriff who can't tell his
ass from a hole in the ground,

09:46.297 --> 09:48.397
and a whole collection of
yahoos who go for a rope

09:48.432 --> 09:50.799
every time a Mexican
looks at a white lady.

09:50.835 --> 09:54.670
So I dunno, son.

09:54.705 --> 09:56.982
It's a pretty short list of suspects.

09:56.985 --> 09:58.274
Well, I got a pretty good idea

09:58.309 --> 10:00.142
which yahoo I'm gonna go see first.

10:11.789 --> 10:14.990
Great goddamn way to
start a birthday party.

11:43.948 --> 11:45.347
What's that in the back?

11:45.383 --> 11:46.913
- It's a man.
- Is he dead?

11:46.916 --> 11:47.916
Get away from there.

11:47.952 --> 11:50.386
- Did you run him over?
- Get. Go on, get.

11:50.421 --> 11:52.287
Oh, my God.

11:52.323 --> 11:54.089
Go inside.

11:54.125 --> 11:55.758
Jeannie, are you okay?

11:55.793 --> 11:58.360
Everybody's fine.

11:58.396 --> 12:00.429
All right, go on with your granddaddy.

12:00.464 --> 12:02.464
You too. Get on in there.

12:06.070 --> 12:07.903
Somebody strung up one
of Pedro García's hands

12:07.938 --> 12:09.405
by the side of the road.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.640
I wasn't gonna leave him there.

12:13.944 --> 12:16.311
Should we cancel this party?

12:17.314 --> 12:18.580
We can't.

12:18.616 --> 12:19.982
We got to show the world

12:20.017 --> 12:22.918
South Texas is a great
place to do business.

12:25.656 --> 12:27.523
I'm sorry, baby.

12:29.326 --> 12:31.093
I understand.

12:51.148 --> 12:52.614
Here's your julep.

12:52.650 --> 12:54.983
Ah, 'tis that time.

12:58.001 --> 12:59.367
Oh, yeah.

12:59.401 --> 13:01.623
That's spot-on-the-nose
perfect, darlin'.

13:01.659 --> 13:04.426
But just for the sake of an experiment,

13:04.462 --> 13:06.829
would you mind passing
me that bottle over there?

13:13.804 --> 13:15.471
Ohh, yeah.

13:16.807 --> 13:18.140
You're gonna be drunk.

13:18.175 --> 13:20.609
Oh, honey if you had to lay down

13:20.644 --> 13:23.479
as much bullshit as I'm
about to lay down tonight,

13:23.514 --> 13:24.746
you'd get drunk, too.

13:24.782 --> 13:26.348
Here you go.

13:26.383 --> 13:28.317
Come here. Hey.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.987
You see that rig out there?

13:32.022 --> 13:33.088
Yeah.

13:33.123 --> 13:34.756
After I get done tonight,

13:34.792 --> 13:38.627
we'll have enough money to
buy six more just like it.

13:38.662 --> 13:40.329
Why do we need so many?

13:40.364 --> 13:43.632
We're running out of time.

13:43.667 --> 13:47.236
Another year like the one we
just endured will finish us.

13:50.307 --> 13:54.209
The era of the cattle
baron is over, honey.

13:54.245 --> 13:56.645
It's over.

13:56.680 --> 14:00.716
What if there isn't
any oil in the ground?

14:00.751 --> 14:03.519
Oh, I'm betting there is.

14:03.554 --> 14:05.854
But what if you're wrong?

14:05.890 --> 14:08.724
If there's no oil, do we lose the ranch?

14:08.759 --> 14:11.360
Well, that's always a risk.

14:11.395 --> 14:14.496
Any time you find a
decent piece of land,

14:14.532 --> 14:16.832
sure as sunup,

14:16.867 --> 14:19.701
someone out there's gonna
try and take it from you.

14:21.171 --> 14:23.105
Does that scare you?

14:25.738 --> 14:27.609
Not anymore.

15:33.944 --> 15:37.379
Oh. Nice to see you back, Miss García.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.247
That's my father's man.

15:39.283 --> 15:42.050
Yeah. Damn shame.

15:42.086 --> 15:43.819
Poor old Armando.

15:45.656 --> 15:47.289
They say he was, uh, riding

15:47.324 --> 15:50.025
with the Mexican bandits, though.

15:53.764 --> 15:55.063
Who found him?

15:55.099 --> 15:57.132
Pete McCullough.

16:07.645 --> 16:08.777
Well.

16:08.812 --> 16:11.813
If it ain't Pete McCullough.

16:14.785 --> 16:18.520
You getting ready for that
fête galant-ay tonight?

16:18.555 --> 16:21.623
I had my shirt pressed special.

16:21.659 --> 16:23.258
You have a hand in that?

16:23.293 --> 16:25.994
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:26.030 --> 16:27.295
Niles.

16:31.535 --> 16:33.135
Well...

16:35.539 --> 16:39.207
If you're referring to that
strung-up cattle rustler,

16:39.243 --> 16:41.209
now that you menti it,

16:41.245 --> 16:43.211
I might know something about that.

16:43.247 --> 16:46.381
Armando couldn't rustle up
supper, let alone 70 head.

16:47.685 --> 16:51.186
He was confederating
with the sediciosos, Pete.

16:51.221 --> 16:54.690
Armando cut the fence,
and he looked the other way

16:54.725 --> 16:58.360
when them Mexers stole your property.

16:58.395 --> 17:02.898
I tell you, my friend,
he admitted to all of it.

17:04.268 --> 17:05.901
In the end.

17:05.935 --> 17:07.969
Jesus, Niles.

17:10.107 --> 17:14.009
You and your daddy
ain't exactly strangers

17:14.044 --> 17:16.545
to backcountry adjudication.

17:16.579 --> 17:20.882
You enlightened plenty of
rustlers at the end of a rope.

17:20.917 --> 17:23.518
That ain't how we do things anymore.

17:23.554 --> 17:25.554
Oh.

17:25.589 --> 17:27.888
If I catch someone stealing my property,

17:27.925 --> 17:30.859
I'll see that he's dealt with.

17:30.894 --> 17:33.729
I don't want your help.

17:33.764 --> 17:35.230
You hear me?

17:35.265 --> 17:38.567
Oh, I hear you all right.

17:38.602 --> 17:42.571
But you might want to make sure
your daddy is of a similar mind.

17:54.284 --> 17:56.852
I had a little talk with Niles Gilbert.

17:56.887 --> 17:57.853
That so?

17:57.888 --> 17:59.287
Yep.

18:02.326 --> 18:04.926
Is this one of them vaudeville routines,

18:04.962 --> 18:07.229
or are you working your
way up to a question?

18:08.232 --> 18:10.899
Did you put him up to hanging that man?

18:12.169 --> 18:14.102
I asked him to sniff around about,

18:14.138 --> 18:15.737
see who was hitting our cattle.

18:15.773 --> 18:18.607
And you didn't consider
how he might interpret that?

18:21.745 --> 18:24.579
I don't want this family in bed
with the Law and Order League.

18:24.615 --> 18:27.382
And I don't want the home I
spent my whole life building

18:27.417 --> 18:30.852
to get snatched out from
underneath our noses.

18:41.698 --> 18:42.964
Sometimes it feels like

18:43.000 --> 18:44.800
I'm in the front of
the boat bailing water

18:44.835 --> 18:48.270
while you're behind me drilling holes.

18:48.305 --> 18:52.407
Who's running this
ranch, Daddy... you or me?

18:52.442 --> 18:53.608
Well...

18:55.379 --> 18:59.481
allegedly, you are.

19:18.463 --> 19:20.898
Armando's wife seemed
to be holding up well.

19:20.933 --> 19:22.032
Considering.

19:22.068 --> 19:23.934
I'm going to the service tomorrow.

19:23.969 --> 19:25.803
Oh, I want to come, too.

19:25.838 --> 19:27.728
She will be very appreciative of that.

19:27.731 --> 19:29.406
Yeah.

Howdy.

Hey, boys.

Hey, John, how are

23:19.738 --> 23:21.738
Mind my bag.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.846
Why, Sally McCullough.

23:29.882 --> 23:31.381
I had no idea it was possible

23:31.417 --> 23:34.284
for a wildflower to bloom indoors.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.053
Phineas.

23:36.088 --> 23:38.155
What kept you? The guests
already started to arrive.

23:38.190 --> 23:39.656
One last investor to round up.

23:39.692 --> 23:41.191
Should be a good group tonight.

23:41.226 --> 23:42.693
We have done everything we can

23:42.728 --> 23:44.361
to make the place lovely for them.

23:44.396 --> 23:47.564
Well, may I offer a little
something for your troubles?

23:48.567 --> 23:50.300
I figure at least one man in this family

23:50.336 --> 23:52.736
ought to buy you nice
things now and again.

23:55.441 --> 23:56.673
I love it.

23:59.024 --> 24:00.010
Thank you.

24:00.045 --> 24:01.712
You're very welcome.

24:01.747 --> 24:03.613
Now, if you'll excuse me...

24:08.020 --> 24:09.853
Those real Comanches out there?

24:09.888 --> 24:14.358
Mm-hmm. Our esteemed guests
deserve a little authenticity.

24:14.393 --> 24:16.226
Who do you got down there?

24:16.261 --> 24:17.694
Ah, it's a good crowd.

24:17.730 --> 24:18.929
Eight or nine bankers

24:18.964 --> 24:20.430
with ties to this part of the state,

24:20.466 --> 24:22.259
all looking for a place
to park their cash.

24:22.262 --> 24:23.145
Mm-hmm.

24:23.148 --> 24:25.564
John Barton's the first
man I want you to meet.

24:25.567 --> 24:27.369
He's always been a big faof yours.

24:27.372 --> 24:28.839
Well, that's good to hear.

24:28.874 --> 24:30.173
You did good, son.

24:30.209 --> 24:33.677
Now, the only way this is gonna work

24:33.712 --> 24:34.745
is you got to sell

24:34.780 --> 24:36.680
the virgin potential of the land.

24:36.715 --> 24:37.678
All right?

24:37.681 --> 24:39.750
They could be the first
to discover oil here

24:39.752 --> 24:42.219
and get ahead of the
wave that's about to come.

24:42.254 --> 24:45.222
Plus, we're offering 1/8th royalties.

24:45.257 --> 24:47.391
No one else is gonna
come even close to that.

24:48.894 --> 24:50.827
You got something to say over there?

24:54.233 --> 24:56.533
This whole thing's a swindle.

24:56.568 --> 24:58.694
Well, that's a strong
word, little brother.

24:58.697 --> 24:59.775
Is it?

24:59.778 --> 25:01.972
We ain't found a drop
of oil on this property.

25:02.007 --> 25:03.540
There's no reason to believe

25:03.575 --> 25:06.043
6 or 7 or 100 new rigs
is gonna change that.

25:06.078 --> 25:07.110
Well, the oil is there.

25:07.146 --> 25:08.311
How do you know that?

25:08.347 --> 25:09.579
Call it faith.

25:09.615 --> 25:10.947
Faith might work with Comanches,

25:10.983 --> 25:12.449
but not with those bankers downstairs.

25:12.451 --> 25:13.784
They want hard evidence.

25:13.819 --> 25:16.586
You got anything real? Anything at all?

25:18.870 --> 25:20.136
Phineas, if you had the money,

25:20.171 --> 25:23.139
would you invest it here, in oil?

25:23.174 --> 25:24.908
I've done dumber things.

25:24.943 --> 25:29.412
So tell me, Pete, what's your plan?

25:29.447 --> 25:32.115
Drink hemlock? Hang a noose?

25:32.150 --> 25:35.418
Stop sucking the blood
out of our core business.

25:35.453 --> 25:38.254
I had to lay off 10 vaqueros
to help pay for the oil rig.

25:38.290 --> 25:40.523
Now we're shorthanded, and
our fences are unguarded.

25:40.558 --> 25:43.327
That's how these rustlers keep
getting away with our livestock.

25:43.330 --> 25:45.017
If blaming me makes
you feel better, fine.

25:45.020 --> 25:46.820
It's your choice got us into this mess.

25:46.823 --> 25:48.589
Cattle ranching's the past.

25:48.592 --> 25:51.034
It's always been there, and
it always will be. It's stable.

25:51.036 --> 25:52.502
It's stagnant.

25:52.537 --> 25:56.572
In this life, if you don't
move forward, you die.

25:58.143 --> 26:00.143
Now, in five minutes,
I'm gonna go down there

26:00.178 --> 26:01.711
and convince these rich bastards

26:01.746 --> 26:03.713
that our shit comes out gold-plated,

26:03.748 --> 26:06.182
that South Texas is the happiest,

26:06.217 --> 26:07.951
safest place on this green Earth.

26:07.986 --> 26:10.153
I'm gonna get them to
open up their wallets

26:10.188 --> 26:14.223
and give us what we need to
create a great Goddamn empire.

26:14.259 --> 26:17.360
You gonna help me do that or not?

26:17.395 --> 26:19.362
Yes, sir.

26:20.532 --> 26:21.831
Fine.

26:21.866 --> 26:24.167
Good. Then get the hell out of my sight.

26:58.678 --> 27:01.012
I can't believe this.

27:01.047 --> 27:03.114
Jeannie?

27:03.149 --> 27:05.016
- You're so grown up.
- Thank you.

27:05.051 --> 27:06.484
How long has it been?

27:06.519 --> 27:08.519
Three years, I think.

27:08.555 --> 27:10.822
Oh, Lord, it has been that long.

27:10.857 --> 27:12.790
- Jeannie, say hello.
- Hello.

27:14.160 --> 27:17.328
Lourdes, Pedro. Thanks for coming.

27:17.364 --> 27:18.963
Well, it's a rare pleasure

27:18.965 --> 27:20.932
celebrating someone being
older than me, Peter.

27:20.967 --> 27:22.367
How is the colonel?

27:22.402 --> 27:24.235
Still kicking.

27:27.207 --> 27:30.441
For your future, compadre,
a piece of my past.

27:30.477 --> 27:33.678
It belonged to my uncle Arturo.

27:33.713 --> 27:35.280
May it continue to bring your family

27:35.315 --> 27:37.215
the luck it's brought mine.

27:40.220 --> 27:43.554
Well, I sure do appreciate it.

27:46.159 --> 27:48.426
Do you have time for a
smoke with your old friend?

27:50.363 --> 27:52.363
Oh, I'm sure Pete does.

27:58.171 --> 27:59.370
Of course.

28:09.783 --> 28:12.583
Maria told me what you
did for my man Armando.

28:12.619 --> 28:14.585
I'm sure you'd do the
same for one of ours.

28:14.621 --> 28:16.020
Yes, of course.

28:16.056 --> 28:17.955
Like for like.

28:20.026 --> 28:21.926
You know we had nothing
to do with it, right?

28:24.297 --> 28:27.231
This would mean a lot more
coming from your father, Peter.

28:27.267 --> 28:29.667
Well, Pedro, I'm the
one runnin' the business.

28:29.703 --> 28:31.903
Now, you're sure you
speak for the colonel?

28:31.938 --> 28:33.771
My name's McCullough, just like his.

28:33.807 --> 28:35.573
Mm.

28:35.608 --> 28:37.275
You are two very different men.

28:38.997 --> 28:41.379
Your father is a simple animal, Peter.

28:41.414 --> 28:43.681
He is untroubled by his conscience.

28:43.717 --> 28:46.184
He sleeps soundly, secure in his belief

28:46.219 --> 28:48.720
that men are as expendable as beef.

28:48.755 --> 28:50.922
But he does not seem to
realize that this philosophy,

28:50.957 --> 28:54.459
this approach to life
can be very contagious.

28:54.494 --> 28:58.987
And once it begins to spread,
it spreads very quickly.

30:09.869 --> 30:11.702
What river is this?

30:11.738 --> 30:13.104
The Llano.

30:13.139 --> 30:15.640
That's impossible.
It's a whole day's ride.

30:15.675 --> 30:17.842
Daddy's never gonna catch up to us.

30:20.914 --> 30:23.981
I think I can shimmy my hands.

30:24.017 --> 30:25.216
For what?

30:25.251 --> 30:27.084
We need to stay ready.

30:28.254 --> 30:31.622
We're not gonna escape, Eli.

30:31.658 --> 30:34.792
How much do you remember
about last night?

30:34.828 --> 30:36.194
Enough.

30:37.764 --> 30:41.299
You were out for most of it.

30:42.769 --> 30:44.502
It was obvious they
were gonna kill Momma,

30:44.537 --> 30:47.138
but I don't think they
meant to kill Lizzie.

30:47.173 --> 30:49.073
After you shot that Indian,

30:49.108 --> 30:50.842
the others began shooting the house,

30:50.877 --> 30:52.710
and Lizzie was hit.

30:54.747 --> 30:58.549
When they saw she was shot,
they looked over her wounds.

30:58.585 --> 31:01.486
I thought maybe they were
gonna doctor her, but...

31:01.521 --> 31:03.821
they must have decided
she wasn't gonna make it.

31:08.761 --> 31:11.262
You got Lizzie killed, Eli.

31:13.766 --> 31:16.567
I hope it was worth it.

31:45.832 --> 31:49.000
_

31:50.116 --> 31:51.701
_

32:01.958 --> 32:04.782
They're gonna kill us if we don't
start doing what they say, Martin.

32:04.784 --> 32:06.117
You hear me?

32:06.152 --> 32:07.985
You'll make a good
little Indian, you know?

32:10.957 --> 32:16.643
_

32:17.435 --> 32:22.023
_

32:22.026 --> 32:23.861
_

32:23.864 --> 32:25.402
_

32:25.402 --> 32:29.239
_

32:29.309 --> 32:32.310
and a little bit of English.

32:37.650 --> 32:39.450
What's your name?

32:39.485 --> 32:41.218
Toshaway.

32:42.655 --> 32:44.622
I'm Eli.

32:44.665 --> 32:47.188
- They're gonna separate us.
- Why would they do that?

32:47.191 --> 32:49.859
These guys are from two different bands.

32:51.164 --> 32:53.798
Get off me! Get off me!

33:22.528 --> 33:25.029
Why do you think they
stopped tying us up?

33:26.733 --> 33:28.599
Nowhere to run to.

33:56.095 --> 33:58.396
Here. Eat something.

33:58.431 --> 34:01.666
You know, I never knew a
place like this could exist.

34:01.701 --> 34:03.234
You need to eat.

34:03.269 --> 34:06.837
I'll bet our tracks will
be covered up by the wind.

34:06.873 --> 34:09.206
They're gonna kill you if you don't eat.

34:09.242 --> 34:11.375
They're gonna kill me anyway.

34:13.880 --> 34:17.348
I thought for sure I'd go to Harvard.

34:17.382 --> 34:19.050
I wrote Emerson about 10 letters,

34:19.085 --> 34:22.687
but I never got a chance
to send any of them.

34:22.722 --> 34:26.590
I'd like to think he would have
taken them seriously, though.

34:26.626 --> 34:29.260
Here. It's not that bad
when you get used to it.

34:40.973 --> 34:44.275
I'm sure you have
your own name for this.

34:44.310 --> 34:51.282
But we call it an Indian
blanket or an Indian sunburst.

34:51.317 --> 34:52.650
It's interesting to note

34:52.685 --> 34:55.485
that small, stunted, or useless plants,

34:55.521 --> 34:58.889
such as the Mexican
plum or the Mexican apple,

34:58.925 --> 35:01.926
we name after our enemies, the Mexicans,

35:01.961 --> 35:06.163
with whom we'll likely be at
war with for centuries to come.

35:06.199 --> 35:09.433
But even now, we name colorful

35:09.469 --> 35:14.004
or beautiful plants after you Indians,

35:14.040 --> 35:18.075
as you will all soon be
vanquished from the Earth.

35:18.111 --> 35:21.979
It is, of course, a great
compliment to your race.

35:22.014 --> 35:25.916
Though, if your vanquishing
had come a bit sooner,

35:25.952 --> 35:28.152
I would not have complained.

35:30.857 --> 35:34.158
"It is the fate of a man like myself

35:34.193 --> 35:37.094
to be misunderstood."

35:37.130 --> 35:40.164
That's Goethe, in case
you were wondering.

35:43.402 --> 35:45.169
I've always been proud of you, buddy.

35:45.204 --> 35:47.004
Martin... Martin!

35:47.039 --> 35:48.005
Martin!

35:49.976 --> 35:51.542
No!

35:51.577 --> 35:53.878
Martin!

35:58.885 --> 36:01.285
Martin!

36:01.320 --> 36:03.120
No! Martin!

36:05.925 --> 36:07.358
Martin!

36:07.393 --> 36:09.727
No!

36:09.762 --> 36:11.462
Martin!

36:27.380 --> 36:29.547
No! Martin!

36:43.729 --> 36:44.929
Martin!

36:46.232 --> 36:48.265
Martin! No!

36:59.479 --> 37:01.845
_

37:01.845 --> 37:04.222
_

37:25.271 --> 37:28.038
Your brother died with great honor.

37:28.074 --> 37:30.875
He only pretended to be a coward.

37:30.910 --> 37:33.911
Really, he was a coyote sent to test us.

37:33.946 --> 37:36.213
_

37:36.249 --> 37:38.649
Bad medicine for Urwat.

37:38.684 --> 37:41.318
And for the rest of us.

38:51.257 --> 38:54.091
It's been forever, hasn't it?

38:54.126 --> 38:55.893
Uh, yeah.

38:55.935 --> 38:58.869
Uh, Christmas three years ago.

38:58.898 --> 39:00.798
Good memory.

39:01.488 --> 39:03.354
So, you here for a while, or are you...?

39:03.357 --> 39:05.869
Oh, no... just until things settle down.

39:05.905 --> 39:08.739
Then... I'll be off again.

39:10.244 --> 39:12.511
So, how's your husband?

39:14.381 --> 39:16.381
He passed away.

39:18.185 --> 39:20.152
So sorry.

39:20.187 --> 39:21.487
When?

39:21.522 --> 39:23.188
Almost two months ago.

39:26.060 --> 39:28.093
God, that is terrible.

39:31.098 --> 39:33.065
How are you doing?

39:33.100 --> 39:34.733
I'm all right.

39:34.768 --> 39:36.135
Just...

39:36.170 --> 39:39.505
It's nice to... To be home,

39:39.540 --> 39:43.842
around family and... familiar things.

39:47.248 --> 39:49.681
Well, I-I better get back.

39:50.618 --> 39:53.218
What's happening around here, Pete?

39:53.254 --> 39:55.387
Everything seems different.

39:55.422 --> 39:57.823
Everyone seems very nervous.

39:57.858 --> 39:59.630
Mexico is in bad shape.

39:59.633 --> 40:01.927
Since they overthrew
Huerta, the revolutionaries

40:01.929 --> 40:03.996
have all been fighting
each other to replace him.

40:04.031 --> 40:08.333
So that spills across the
river and causes trouble.

40:08.369 --> 40:12.204
The local yokels get worked
up, cause even more trouble,

40:12.239 --> 40:13.372
and you know...

40:15.109 --> 40:17.376
And people get hung.

40:18.913 --> 40:20.445
Yeah.

40:24.618 --> 40:26.418
Nice to see you.

40:27.788 --> 40:29.621
You haven't aged a day.

40:32.326 --> 40:35.594
Who wants to hear a few words
from the man of the hour?

40:35.629 --> 40:36.962
Anyone?

40:36.997 --> 40:38.697
I guess, uh...

40:38.732 --> 40:39.765
Pete.

40:44.505 --> 40:46.972
Thanks for taking care of Armando.

40:47.007 --> 40:49.708
Yeah, sure. No problem.

40:49.743 --> 40:52.477
I enjoy delivering speeches

40:52.513 --> 40:54.813
just about as much as I do hearing them.

40:56.350 --> 40:58.283
But considering we got
a lot of people here

40:58.319 --> 40:59.451
who've traveled many a mile,

40:59.486 --> 41:01.086
and given that only the devil knows

41:01.121 --> 41:03.956
if I'm gonna be standing
here this time next year,

41:03.991 --> 41:06.225
I figured I better pay
you all my respects.

41:07.861 --> 41:11.496
I was born on the same date
as the Republic of Texas.

41:11.532 --> 41:12.764
Hear, hear.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.333
And you do not reach my age

41:14.368 --> 41:17.069
without accommodating
your fair share of change.

41:17.104 --> 41:18.136
- That's right.
- Yeah.

41:18.172 --> 41:20.606
I was taught at a very early age

41:20.641 --> 41:22.574
you have to roll with the punches.

41:22.610 --> 41:23.842
Hear, hear.

41:23.877 --> 41:27.079
Now... Now, I see some old faces here

41:27.114 --> 41:30.249
from a lot of different sides
of a lot of different fights.

41:30.284 --> 41:32.618
Some of you, I've rode with.

41:32.653 --> 41:33.752
Yes, sir.

41:33.787 --> 41:37.422
Some of you, I've fought with.

41:37.458 --> 41:39.491
And some of you, I've bled with.

41:39.526 --> 41:40.638
That's right.

41:40.641 --> 41:42.739
And some of you, maybe
back in the bad old days,

41:42.742 --> 41:44.062
might have taken a shot at me.

41:45.065 --> 41:46.765
Maybe one of your relatives did.

41:47.917 --> 41:50.636
But I guess what I'm
trying to say here is

41:50.671 --> 41:53.038
that those times are over.

41:53.073 --> 41:54.940
We're entering the modern age.

41:54.975 --> 41:56.708
If anyone picks up a gun now,

41:56.744 --> 41:59.177
it's because we're
out for quail or deer.

41:59.213 --> 42:01.446
Yeah. I hear ya.

42:01.482 --> 42:03.649
I've lived all over the West.

42:03.684 --> 42:06.952
And this little patch of South Texas,

42:06.995 --> 42:09.663
I decided to call home.

42:09.690 --> 42:11.290
- It's good weather.
- Yes, sir.

42:11.325 --> 42:13.325
The sweetest water for 500 miles.

42:13.360 --> 42:14.326
Yeah. Absolutely.

42:14.361 --> 42:16.728
We got oil, we got gas,

42:16.764 --> 42:20.799
we got monster bucks and
quail comin' out our ears!

42:24.104 --> 42:29.374
So there's a good reason I
chose to raise my family here,

42:29.410 --> 42:33.545
and I'm honored you all could
come down and share it with me.

42:33.580 --> 42:35.447
So...

42:36.888 --> 42:39.217
here's to comin' together.

42:39.253 --> 42:40.552
Hear, hear.

42:40.587 --> 42:42.521
Here's to the good guys finally winning.

42:42.556 --> 42:43.522
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

42:43.557 --> 42:45.991
Here's to family and home

42:46.026 --> 42:49.227
and the most bountiful
place on God's green Earth.

42:49.263 --> 42:50.829
God bless Texas!

42:50.864 --> 42:52.030
God bless Texas!

42:55.102 --> 42:58.670
Ah, I need to wet my whistle
here, Niles. Don't be shy.

42:58.706 --> 43:01.006
Hell of a speech, Colonel.
A real inspiration.

43:01.041 --> 43:03.575
Oh, thanks, John. That
means a lot coming from you.

43:03.610 --> 43:05.243
Now, listen, can I bend your ear

43:05.279 --> 43:06.912
and we talk a little business outside?

43:06.947 --> 43:08.380
Sure. You're buying the drinks.

43:08.415 --> 43:09.948
Ah, you're drinking.

43:11.552 --> 43:13.018
Oh, I wouldn't listen

43:13.053 --> 43:15.554
to what anyone has to
say about this place.

43:15.589 --> 43:18.423
If you'd put $100 into
this land around here

43:18.459 --> 43:21.760
about five years ago, you
would have $2,000 today.

43:21.795 --> 43:23.929
That railroad is about the best thing

43:23.964 --> 43:25.197
that ever happened to us.

43:25.232 --> 43:26.231
Hm.

44:03.437 --> 44:06.438
I want everybody on this
ranch working on putting this out!

44:07.508 --> 44:09.592
A dry well shouldn't have
caught fire like this.

44:11.345 --> 44:13.111
They used dynamite.

44:28.061 --> 44:29.461
I've got tracks!

44:29.496 --> 44:31.157
Five or six horses!

44:33.333 --> 44:34.766
Hyah! Let's go!

44:39.540 --> 44:41.306
Hyah! Hah!

44:45.012 --> 44:46.645
Hyah! Hah!

44:55.255 --> 44:57.355
One of them split off.

44:57.391 --> 44:59.324
Hyah!

45:08.535 --> 45:10.068
Right here.

45:10.103 --> 45:14.072
Five of the riders keep
hard south for the river.

45:15.703 --> 45:17.569
The other looks like
his horse threw him.

45:20.848 --> 45:23.081
This bastard's close.

45:50.611 --> 45:52.410
- I got him.
- Hyah!

46:48.101 --> 46:49.768
Daddy.

46:49.803 --> 46:51.102
Daddy!

46:51.138 --> 46:52.458
That's Pedro García's son-in-law!

46:52.472 --> 46:53.605
I don't give a shit!

46:53.640 --> 46:55.807
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Stop it!

46:55.842 --> 46:58.143
Come on! Stop it!

46:58.178 --> 47:00.979
Get your hands off me!
Get your hands off me!

47:17.132 --> 47:19.531
You kill him, and we start a war.

47:19.566 --> 47:21.633
The war's already here.

47:31.529 --> 47:34.661
I thought your kind did
your killing with a rope.

47:37.050 --> 47:40.485
That's the best idea I heard all night.

47:40.520 --> 47:43.388
Tom, toss me that lariat.

47:43.423 --> 47:45.190
Yeah, boss.
