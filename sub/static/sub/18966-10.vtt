Previously on
<i>The Client List...</i>

00:01.429 --> 00:02.757
Your staying here
is temporary.

00:02.782 --> 00:04.396
And so is you
being a father to my kids.

00:04.421 --> 00:05.958
I will never respect you again.

00:05.959 --> 00:07.293
That's rich
coming from the man

00:07.327 --> 00:08.461
who tried to steal
his brother's wife.

00:08.495 --> 00:09.729
Are you seeing somebody?
You are.

00:09.763 --> 00:11.497
So, man,
where's your girlfriend?

00:11.532 --> 00:12.632
Girlfriend.
Shelby, right?

00:12.666 --> 00:13.900
That was
the fertility doctor.

00:13.934 --> 00:15.902
We only have
a 10% chance of conception.

00:15.936 --> 00:18.170
If Vandermeyer Construction
were to recoup their losses,

00:18.205 --> 00:20.006
they'd most likely drop
the charges against Kyle.

00:20.040 --> 00:21.173
Vandermeyer steals
from everyone.

00:21.208 --> 00:22.508
That guy is nothing
but trouble.

00:22.543 --> 00:25.745
Harold could be
my last chance at love.

00:25.779 --> 00:27.813
What are you grinning at?
Nothing.

00:27.848 --> 00:29.248
Derek doesn't look at me
like that.

00:29.283 --> 00:31.450
I don't want to be
fun buddies anymore.

00:31.485 --> 00:32.818
You want to go steady?
Hell no.

00:32.853 --> 00:34.787
Hey,
are you shitting me?!

00:34.821 --> 00:37.256
Who is that guy, huh?
Greg Carlyle. He owns Wild Nights.

00:37.291 --> 00:39.926
It's in the best interest of
everyone that I own the Rub.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.794
I got a buyer.
I hope you don't regret it.

00:41.828 --> 00:43.195
Riley, whatever you did
with the client list,

00:43.230 --> 00:45.398
make sure
it's good and hidden.

00:50.037 --> 00:53.839
I mean...
What was Georgia thinking?

00:53.874 --> 00:55.942
I think it's supposed to
be romantic.

00:55.976 --> 00:58.902
Frankly, my dear Lacey,
I do give a damn.

00:58.927 --> 01:00.034
Well, it's not so bad.

01:00.035 --> 01:02.589
I mean, if we could just remove
some of this fabric.

01:02.614 --> 01:03.804
Oh, well.

01:03.805 --> 01:05.573
I guess we can make it work.
Oh, that's the spirit.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.274
Oh, who am I kidding?

01:07.309 --> 01:10.110
I look like a big,
giant Easter peep.

01:12.314 --> 01:14.415
Go ahead. Take your best shot.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.950
I can handle it.

01:15.984 --> 01:17.618
Wow. Well, you make any dress
look beautiful.

01:17.652 --> 01:20.521
Oh, there may be hope
for him yet.

01:20.555 --> 01:23.290
Good morning, Lacey.
Kids ready?

01:23.325 --> 01:25.492
They'll be out in a minute.
Hey, Travis, Katie, let's go!

01:25.527 --> 01:27.161
Look, I know that you worked
the night shift with Dale,

01:27.195 --> 01:29.029
so you sure
you're not too tired?

01:29.064 --> 01:31.031
You kidding? Taking the kids to
school is the best part of my day.

01:31.066 --> 01:33.234
I swung by the motel,
got a change of clothes.

01:33.268 --> 01:35.569
I'm good to go.
Thank you.

01:35.604 --> 01:37.905
Yeah, I just want to do
whatever I can to help out,

01:37.939 --> 01:39.773
which is why I want to take you
on a little adventure.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.476
Adventure?
Like Indiana Jones?

01:42.510 --> 01:44.612
Like I'm not telling you.
It's a surprise.

01:44.646 --> 01:47.248
I don't know. I just thought with
kids away at day camp tomorrow ...

01:47.282 --> 01:49.750
I don't know ... I got a little
something special planned.

01:49.784 --> 01:51.285
Like a date?

01:51.319 --> 01:52.853
Yeah,
like a daytime date.

01:52.887 --> 01:54.922
Yeah, I know you do so much
for everybody.

01:54.956 --> 01:56.257
I want to do something
for you for a change.

01:56.291 --> 01:57.591
I like the sound
of that.

01:57.626 --> 01:58.859
All right.
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

01:58.893 --> 02:01.629
So, it's a...date.

02:05.133 --> 02:07.334
So, guess it's a date,
huh?

02:07.369 --> 02:08.502
It's a date.

02:13.541 --> 02:17.278
You, sir,
are a bad influence.

02:17.312 --> 02:18.679
I really should go.

02:18.713 --> 02:21.115
As much as I like
wearing your boxer shorts,

02:21.149 --> 02:23.817
I haven't been back
to my place in three days.

02:23.852 --> 02:27.254
What's wrong with that?
I could get used to you here.

02:28.523 --> 02:29.490
That's sweet.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.325
I just have some stuff

02:31.359 --> 02:33.127
I have to take care of
before our shift.

02:33.161 --> 02:36.463
Well, at least let me
make you breakfast.

02:36.498 --> 02:38.565
I'm really not hungry.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.334
Everything okay?

02:40.368 --> 02:42.069
Yeah.
It's just...I have to go.

02:42.103 --> 02:43.504
Yeah, I can tell.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.373
You're practically
running out the door.

02:46.408 --> 02:48.776
I like you, Evan.

02:48.810 --> 02:51.545
I like you a lot, and it scares
the hell out of me.

02:51.579 --> 02:53.113
There's nothing
to be scared of.

02:53.148 --> 02:54.948
Do you know how hard it is
to be a woman on the force

02:54.983 --> 02:56.183
to be taken seriously?

02:56.217 --> 02:57.518
Do you want to stop?

02:57.552 --> 03:01.722
No. It's just...

03:01.756 --> 03:03.557
I had three older brothers
who taught me

03:03.591 --> 03:04.825
to never let my guard down.

03:04.859 --> 03:07.461
And you and me
getting close, it's ...

03:07.495 --> 03:08.862
it's hard.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.298
Well, I know all about
putting up walls.

03:11.333 --> 03:14.301
And when it comes to
messed-up older brothers,

03:14.336 --> 03:15.903
I think I got you beat.

03:17.739 --> 03:21.041
I haven't felt this way
about someone in a while.

03:23.345 --> 03:25.446
You're worth the risk.

03:29.884 --> 03:34.388
Now let's go back
to being bad.

03:44.232 --> 03:47.601
Hey, is that a studded-strap
Louis Vuitton barrel bag

03:47.635 --> 03:49.036
with a magnetic snap?

03:49.070 --> 03:51.271
I lost
my Louis virginity.

03:51.306 --> 03:53.006
You mean my virginity.

03:53.041 --> 03:54.241
That's my bag,
isn't it?

03:54.275 --> 03:56.744
You sold it...
And the bag.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.747
Give me that!

03:59.781 --> 04:02.116
That's chili.

04:02.150 --> 04:05.953
You did not eat
your white-trash chili dog

04:05.987 --> 04:09.089
with my $1,100
Louis vuitton purse.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.558
Which I bought
for $300.

04:11.593 --> 04:14.561
Besides, I was hungry.
Calm down, Selena.

04:14.596 --> 04:16.764
I just want to have some
nice things in my life, too.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.600
Besides, you're already
having fun with Derek.

04:21.101 --> 04:23.470
You're not.

04:23.505 --> 04:24.738
Ooh...

04:24.773 --> 04:26.373
You listen here,
single white female.

04:26.408 --> 04:28.642
You can buy as many fancy purses
as you want.

04:28.676 --> 04:32.012
But Derek ... he's off limits.
You got that?

04:35.450 --> 04:38.285
Not that you could get him
if you tried.

04:40.288 --> 04:42.923
Thanks again
for the purse!

04:45.260 --> 04:47.628
Hey.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.630
Oh, lord ... why don't you
just call up Georgia

04:49.664 --> 04:50.831
and tell her you're not
wearing that thing?

04:50.865 --> 04:52.566
Because I can't do that.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.268
I'm just gonna have the tailor
fix a few things. It'll be fine.

04:54.302 --> 04:56.470
Oh, yeah. Keep dreaming.
I've been in over 10 weddings.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.672
I know an ugly-ass bridesmaid's
dress when I see one.

04:58.706 --> 05:01.275
Good lord. Over 10?
Mm. Got a big family.

05:01.309 --> 05:03.677
Well, it's Georgia's day.
This is what she wants.

05:03.711 --> 05:05.479
I'll just wear it
with a smile.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.147
Have fun.
Hey.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.582
Morning, Riley.
Morning.

05:12.454 --> 05:15.022
Oh.

05:15.056 --> 05:17.257
Problem in the workplace?

05:17.292 --> 05:20.461
Yep.
I got a nosy-ass boss.

05:20.495 --> 05:23.664
She called me the boss.

05:23.698 --> 05:27.100
You are a dream come true.

05:27.135 --> 05:28.602
A dream?

05:28.636 --> 05:30.204
No, I am not, 'cause dreams
don't come true.

05:30.238 --> 05:33.640
But fantasy ... yes, I am,
'cause I always deliver.

05:33.675 --> 05:35.476
Yes, you do.

05:35.510 --> 05:36.844
Hey, thanks
for fitting me in.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.479
I really needed to see you
before tonight.

05:38.513 --> 05:40.481
Yeah, what's going on tonight?
Something big?

05:40.515 --> 05:41.982
Possibly.

05:42.016 --> 05:46.687
I met this woman ... Penny.
She's spectacular.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.022
I mean, she can cite

05:49.057 --> 05:51.391
every member of the Cowboys'
offensive line by memory.

05:51.426 --> 05:52.793
She's a Cowboys fan?

05:52.827 --> 05:54.161
I didn't say
she was perfect.

05:55.330 --> 05:56.897
Tonight's
our first date.

05:56.931 --> 05:59.533
Okay. So you don't
want to be distracted.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.535
By wanting to get
into her pants? Exactly.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.836
Got it.

06:02.871 --> 06:05.539
I always go too fast,
screw things up.

06:05.573 --> 06:06.540
I get it.

06:06.574 --> 06:07.941
You really like her,

06:07.976 --> 06:09.943
so you wanted to come
and see me first.

06:09.978 --> 06:11.812
It's man logic, I know.

06:11.846 --> 06:14.214
"Man logic."

06:14.249 --> 06:15.782
I suppose I could have
taken care of myself

06:15.817 --> 06:19.486
before I went out tonight,
but you do a better job.

06:19.521 --> 06:21.221
Well, that is true.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.690
Okay, so, killing two birds
with one massage. I get it.

06:23.725 --> 06:26.527
Now, this Penny ...
she seems real special.

06:26.561 --> 06:28.629
She is.

06:28.663 --> 06:32.366
That's why I want to focus
on her as a person,

06:32.400 --> 06:34.368
you know, woo her right.

06:34.402 --> 06:36.203
Wow ... it is hard for us girls
to find a guy

06:36.237 --> 06:38.639
who knows
how to woo us right.

06:38.673 --> 06:40.207
I think I can help you
with that.

06:42.243 --> 06:44.311
# You're gonna shoot me down

06:44.345 --> 06:46.313
# you're gonna shoot,
shoot #

06:46.347 --> 06:48.682
# you're gonna shoot me down

06:48.716 --> 06:52.019
# shoot me down

06:57.158 --> 06:59.126
These are for you,
my lady.

06:59.160 --> 07:01.328
Aww.
Thank you, kind sir.

07:01.362 --> 07:02.729
My favorite.

07:02.764 --> 07:06.333
So, is this proper
adventure attire?

07:07.268 --> 07:09.102
It's perfect.

07:10.772 --> 07:12.372
Your carriage awaits.

07:12.407 --> 07:14.508
Oh.

07:21.382 --> 07:22.156
Are you taking me hiking?

07:22.181 --> 07:23.550
Because if so, you should
have told me. These boots ...

07:25.086 --> 07:27.054
You can guess all you want.
I'm still not telling you.

07:28.723 --> 07:30.457
Ugh. Okay, you know what?
Today is a personal day.

07:30.491 --> 07:33.060
The kids are safe. We're happy.
I'm turning that thing off.

07:33.094 --> 07:34.494
Nice.

07:34.529 --> 07:36.496
I know how hard you work.
That must not be easy.

07:36.531 --> 07:38.966
Well, it's easier
than you think.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.568
Oh, my God!

07:41.603 --> 07:42.903
Horses?!

07:42.937 --> 07:45.505
Yeah. We got them
for the whole day.

07:45.540 --> 07:47.140
Mazur Ranch
is just over that hill.

07:47.175 --> 07:50.344
Oh, my gosh.
They're so beautiful.

07:50.378 --> 07:52.079
You know how much
I love riding.

07:52.113 --> 07:54.147
Yeah, I do.
That's why I got them.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.249
Today is for you.

07:56.284 --> 07:59.753
Now, I haven't been on
a horse in a while, so...

07:59.787 --> 08:01.588
Don't make fun.
You're gonna do great.

08:01.623 --> 08:04.191
You know we haven't been riding
together since high school?

08:04.225 --> 08:05.525
Oh, I remember.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.160
That was the first time
you let me kiss you.

08:07.195 --> 08:10.530
It wasn't the first time
I thought about it.

08:10.565 --> 08:14.167
Oh. Look at you
getting up there like a pro.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.837
Yeah, well,
we're not moving yet.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.105
Thanks for doing this
for me.

08:18.139 --> 08:20.574
Of course. Anytime.

08:20.608 --> 08:23.443
All right, let's see
what you got.

08:23.478 --> 08:25.879
All right.

08:25.913 --> 08:28.348
Here goes nothing.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.384
Come on.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.389
Yes, that's right, Linette.

08:35.423 --> 08:37.957
Inez wants to look more
Linette Montgomery

08:37.991 --> 08:39.426
and less Marilyn Monroe.

08:39.460 --> 08:41.727
Inez wants my color?

08:41.763 --> 08:44.464
Well, I guess imitation is
the highest form of flattery.

08:44.499 --> 08:45.599
This looks blond.

08:45.633 --> 08:47.200
If I put that on her,

08:47.235 --> 08:48.268
she's gonna look like
a creature from "Avatar."

08:48.302 --> 08:49.403
I heard that!

08:49.437 --> 08:51.405
Do not make me "Avatar."

08:51.439 --> 08:53.206
You people burnt me
last time.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.308
Oh, good lord. Are you
still whining about that?

08:55.343 --> 08:56.443
Shh!
Well, I can't ...

08:56.477 --> 08:58.045
you'll be fine, Inez.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.313
Find the color.
She's mid-bleach.

09:00.348 --> 09:02.315
Okay.
Just look in the back of the display,

09:02.350 --> 09:04.051
top shelf.

09:04.085 --> 09:08.121
I am looking, honey,
but we are plumb out.

09:08.156 --> 09:10.657
Well, I may have a few spare
bottles, uh, at Riley's,

09:10.692 --> 09:12.059
under her sink.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.728
Well, isn't that nice
to know? Thank you.

09:14.762 --> 09:17.497
Apparently, Linette has
her own secret stash

09:17.532 --> 09:20.801
at Riley's for her own
touch-ups under her sink.

09:22.336 --> 09:24.938
Note to self. Charge Linette
for extra supplies.

09:24.972 --> 09:26.807
Okay. Well, I've got a key
to Riley's.

09:26.841 --> 09:28.675
If I rush, I can be back
in 20 minutes.

09:28.710 --> 09:31.111
Inez, you're gonna cook
for another 30 minutes.

09:31.145 --> 09:33.847
Taylor's gonna keep an eye
on you, okay?

09:33.881 --> 09:35.916
I swear to God,
if you burn me ...

09:35.950 --> 09:38.151
I can't hear you,
Inez.

09:46.661 --> 09:49.496
You owe me one, Inez.

09:54.168 --> 09:57.304
Riley?

10:03.478 --> 10:06.880
Someone there?

10:15.456 --> 10:18.024
Riley?

10:31.239 --> 10:33.039
Stop him!
Somebody help!

10:33.074 --> 10:35.942
He broke into the house!
Somebody help me!

10:38.513 --> 10:40.981
911.
Yes. Hello?

10:41.015 --> 10:42.482
Yeah, I've been attacked.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.551
Somebody just broke
into the ho...

10:44.585 --> 10:50.223
Oh! Oh, my God!

10:50.258 --> 10:51.458
Somebody help me.

10:51.492 --> 10:54.294
Ow! Oh...God!

10:56.581 --> 10:58.941
Here you want some apple.
Thanks for the ride stud.

10:59.235 --> 11:00.536
You don't want any?

11:00.570 --> 11:02.671
Oh, no. You're playing
hard to get. Okay.

11:05.308 --> 11:07.276
Hey, Dale.
You sure?

11:07.310 --> 11:10.112
Yeah, she's with me.
We've been riding all day.

11:10.146 --> 11:12.347
Her phone is off.
Why ...

11:12.382 --> 11:15.551
yeah. Hang on.
It's Dale.

11:15.585 --> 11:18.554
Okay. Hey, Dale.
What's going on?

11:18.588 --> 11:20.088
What?

11:21.558 --> 11:24.092
Oh, my God. Okay, yeah,
I'm ... I'm o-on my way.

11:24.127 --> 11:26.295
It's ... it's Lacey. She's hurt.
We got to get to the hospital.

11:26.329 --> 11:27.930
All right. I'll drive you.

11:27.964 --> 11:30.699
Then I'll pick the kids up from camp.
Okay.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.534
Whoa.
Oh!

11:32.569 --> 11:33.569
Sorry.

11:36.272 --> 11:37.773
Note to self.

11:37.807 --> 11:40.776
Can't do five straight clients
without stretching.

11:40.810 --> 11:42.411
Forearms?

11:42.445 --> 11:44.713
I hate that. Here.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.582
Let me give you
a hand.

11:48.518 --> 11:51.486
I like you, Derek.
I like you a lot.

11:52.789 --> 11:55.123
You find me sexy,
don't you?

11:55.158 --> 11:56.758
Of course I do.

11:56.793 --> 11:58.727
Then let's give it
a shot.

11:58.761 --> 12:01.563
We should at least see
if we have any chemistry.

12:01.598 --> 12:04.399
If not, then we'll stay
good friends.

12:04.434 --> 12:06.602
Nobody's feelings
get hurt.

12:06.636 --> 12:09.438
But...

12:09.472 --> 12:12.007
If this is as hot
as I think it's gonna be...

12:12.041 --> 12:15.644
We could have something
really special.

12:15.678 --> 12:19.114
# Is your love

12:19.148 --> 12:22.084
# big enough
for what's to come? #

12:22.118 --> 12:23.919
# Baby, let me know

12:23.953 --> 12:27.990
# is your love

12:28.024 --> 12:30.826
# big enough for past is done? #
Wash my back?

12:30.860 --> 12:34.997
# Baby, let me know

12:36.332 --> 12:37.699
All your tests
have come back normal.

12:37.734 --> 12:40.285
Okay. You hear that? Tests are
normal. You're gonna be fine.

12:40.286 --> 12:41.670
As a precaution,
we're gonna keep you here

12:41.671 --> 12:43.839
a few days to make sure
there's no internal bleeding.

12:43.873 --> 12:46.642
Best thing you can do
is get some rest.

12:46.676 --> 12:47.339
Dale, did you hear that?

12:47.364 --> 12:48.731
She said that there's
internal bleeding.

12:48.756 --> 12:49.544
What? What?

12:49.545 --> 12:50.979
Oh, my God. My organs are bleeding out.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12:51.014 --> 12:52.281
I know something's wrong.
She didn't say that.

12:52.315 --> 12:54.383
And you just need
to chill, okay?

12:54.417 --> 12:58.420
I know exactly
what you need.

13:00.423 --> 13:03.292
Hey,
"Brothers and Lovers."

13:03.326 --> 13:04.726
I don't think
I'm really in the...

13:06.429 --> 13:07.529
Pull up a chair.

13:07.563 --> 13:09.164
How could you,
Cassandra?

13:09.198 --> 13:13.001
Simon, you were in the coma
for so long.

13:13.036 --> 13:14.303
What else could I do?

13:14.337 --> 13:16.405
Okay, could you explain this
to me again?

13:16.439 --> 13:17.888
Yeah, Simon and Cassandra
are married.

13:17.913 --> 13:18.440
Mm-hmm.

13:18.441 --> 13:19.841
So, Simon fell into a coma.
Okay.

13:19.876 --> 13:22.244
Cassandra started dating
Simon's brother, Xander.

13:22.278 --> 13:26.481
Okay.
That would never happen.

13:26.516 --> 13:28.483
And who named somebody
Xander?

13:28.518 --> 13:30.352
- I don't know.
- Lacey?!

13:30.386 --> 13:33.255
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Just a little bit banged up.

13:33.289 --> 13:35.057
I'm okay.
Oh, thank God.

13:35.091 --> 13:37.092
I can't believe you found
someone breaking into my house.

13:37.126 --> 13:38.427
He was ...
it was in your bedroom.

13:38.461 --> 13:40.929
And I just
tried to stop him,

13:40.964 --> 13:42.884
and then he ran, well,
right over me, apparently.

13:42.899 --> 13:44.866
But I'm just so happy
that the kids were not home.

13:44.901 --> 13:46.201
Okay, guys,
you know what?

13:46.235 --> 13:47.903
Let's just relax.
You heard the doctor.

13:47.937 --> 13:49.271
Lacey's fine.
The baby's fine.

13:49.305 --> 13:50.572
The baby?

13:50.606 --> 13:51.873
Dale.
Uh-oh.

13:51.908 --> 13:53.342
Wait. Are you ...
are you pregnant?

13:53.376 --> 13:55.444
Nice, Dale.
I'm sorry. It just slipped out.

13:55.478 --> 13:56.878
No, no, no!
You guys, are you pregnant?

13:56.913 --> 13:59.715
Since we had
so much trouble conceiving,

13:59.749 --> 14:02.884
we wanted to wait
until the three-month mark

14:02.919 --> 14:05.187
before we told anyone,
but ...

14:05.221 --> 14:06.421
Oh, my God! I'm pregnant!

14:06.456 --> 14:08.090
That's why I've been
drinking alone!

14:08.124 --> 14:10.579
Oh, and the pickles. Oh, my God.
You ate so many pickles.

14:10.580 --> 14:11.204
Okay. Got it.

14:11.229 --> 14:12.749
Riley, can we just keep this
a secret until we ...

14:12.750 --> 14:14.025
Yes, yes, yes. Of course.

14:14.050 --> 14:16.050
Auntie Riley will take
care of everything.

14:16.265 --> 14:17.566
A baby!

14:17.600 --> 14:19.134
Okay. Wow.
Oh.

14:19.168 --> 14:20.969
Hospital.
I'm so sorry. I'm so bad at that.

14:21.004 --> 14:22.404
You're okay.
A baby.

14:22.438 --> 14:24.706
I know. We're so excited.
Oh!

14:30.480 --> 14:32.881
You know, the police were
already here dusting for prints.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.216
Yeah, well,
I am the police,

14:34.250 --> 14:35.617
and I was just stopping by
after my shift

14:35.651 --> 14:37.419
to make sure Riley
was okay.

14:37.453 --> 14:39.154
Yeah, well,
that's very thoughtful of you.

14:39.188 --> 14:40.489
But I'm here now.
She's fine.

14:43.292 --> 14:45.293
Is Lacey all right?
She's okay.

14:45.328 --> 14:46.928
She's gonna have to stay in
the hospital for a few days,

14:46.963 --> 14:48.263
but she's all right.

14:49.365 --> 14:50.665
Kids?

14:50.700 --> 14:52.467
They're good.
They're sound asleep.

14:52.502 --> 14:53.902
Good.

14:53.936 --> 14:56.938
I checked the perimeter ...
locks, the doors.

14:56.973 --> 14:58.340
Nothing's broken.

14:58.374 --> 15:00.175
You're safe here.
Thank you.

15:01.310 --> 15:04.679
Hey, you know, um...Lacey did
get some things on this guy.

15:04.714 --> 15:09.684
He was in an old Cadillac
with license plate, uh, R73.

15:09.719 --> 15:11.686
He also had a scar
on his cheek.

15:11.721 --> 15:13.522
Yeah, no, I know.
It's all in the police report.

15:13.556 --> 15:15.123
I promise you ...
we're on it.

15:15.158 --> 15:18.160
Uh, do you have anything else
so far?

15:18.194 --> 15:19.828
Well,
the detective did say

15:19.862 --> 15:21.963
that this was not
a random break-in.

15:21.998 --> 15:22.839
And what does that mean?

15:22.864 --> 15:24.864
It means if this was just
a smash-and-grab,

15:24.967 --> 15:26.635
the guy would have
trashed the house,

15:26.669 --> 15:28.170
but nothing
was out of place.

15:28.204 --> 15:29.938
The locks
weren't even broken.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.339
We didn't want anyone
to know he was here.

15:31.374 --> 15:33.875
This guy was after
something specific.

15:36.479 --> 15:39.114
Look. What ...
what can I do to help?

15:39.148 --> 15:41.550
Nothing. Just let
the authorities handle it.

15:41.584 --> 15:43.885
I'll make sure we follow up
on every lead.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.887
Lacey's family.

15:45.922 --> 15:49.624
Damn right she is family.

15:49.659 --> 15:51.059
I need you
to drop everything

15:51.094 --> 15:52.961
and go and get this guy, okay?
You promise me?

15:52.995 --> 15:55.831
I promise.

16:07.577 --> 16:10.378
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Aah! Sorry.

16:10.413 --> 16:11.847
Hey.
Veil or no veil?

16:11.881 --> 16:14.282
No veil. I need to talk
to you privately.

16:14.317 --> 16:16.485
All right. What is going on
with you?

16:16.519 --> 16:18.854
You're acting like
you've seen a ghost.

16:18.888 --> 16:21.169
Someone just broke into my
house, and they attacked Lacey.

16:21.190 --> 16:23.158
Is she all right?
Yeah, she's gonna be fine, thank God.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.993
But I think
he was after the list.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.294
Why are you saying that?

16:26.329 --> 16:27.662
Because he didn't
steal anything.

16:27.697 --> 16:29.531
He was looking
for something specific.

16:29.565 --> 16:31.748
Well, the client list
holds a lot of power ...

16:31.773 --> 16:32.901
blackmail, revenge.

16:32.902 --> 16:34.717
Georgia, do you think
it was Carlyle?

16:34.742 --> 16:35.904
It's possible.

16:35.905 --> 16:38.073
Carlyle has been after
the Rub clients for a while.

16:38.107 --> 16:41.042
He even made me an offer
to buy the spa.

16:41.077 --> 16:42.544
Wait. He what?

16:42.578 --> 16:44.713
Yes, and I immediately
turned him down, of course.

16:44.747 --> 16:46.414
And the client list
is safe, isn't it?

16:46.449 --> 16:47.983
It's safe.
I've been real careful.

16:48.017 --> 16:49.518
But they just broke into
my house.

16:49.552 --> 16:51.186
I mean, they've threatened
my family.

16:51.220 --> 16:52.387
What am I
supposed to do?

16:52.421 --> 16:55.023
Well,
in a business like ours,

16:55.057 --> 16:56.324
you have got to protect
what matters,

16:56.359 --> 16:59.895
and that is you
and your family.

16:59.929 --> 17:02.898
And, honey,
there is nothing...

17:02.932 --> 17:05.599
that I wouldn't do
to protect my family.

17:07.569 --> 17:08.703
You understand me?

17:17.617 --> 17:20.333
Georgia, look, I've ... I've
crossed a lot of lines lately,

17:20.334 --> 17:22.202
but I can't cross this one.
But, sugar ...

17:22.236 --> 17:24.771
No, I've got two kids at home.
I can't have a gun around them.

17:24.806 --> 17:26.138
So what are you
going to do?

17:26.174 --> 17:27.641
I have no idea.

17:27.675 --> 17:29.643
But I'm gonna have to try
and find this guy

17:29.677 --> 17:31.878
and call in a favor.
Well...

17:34.015 --> 17:37.984
Simon's back now, Xander.
We have to stop.

17:38.019 --> 17:40.387
Don't make this harder
than it already is.

17:40.421 --> 17:43.123
I'll never give up
on you, Cassandra.

17:43.157 --> 17:44.624
Put your hands
on my wife again,

17:44.659 --> 17:46.092
and I'll kill you,
brother.

17:46.127 --> 17:48.094
Simon!
Does Simon ever wear clothes?

17:48.129 --> 17:50.096
No, thank God.
Now, shh!

17:50.131 --> 17:51.331
You'd kill
your own brother?

17:51.365 --> 17:52.799
If I had to.

17:52.834 --> 17:55.235
What?!
Oh, my God.

17:55.269 --> 17:57.604
That's it. I'm switching sides.
I-I'm team Xander now.

17:57.638 --> 17:59.606
Thank you.
I mean, Simon ...

17:59.640 --> 18:01.441
you know, he was in a coma
for over a year.

18:01.476 --> 18:04.077
Cassandra has every right
to date his younger brother.

18:04.111 --> 18:05.479
At first, I thought, you know,
a brother does not step on

18:05.513 --> 18:07.647
another brother's territory,
coma or not.

18:07.682 --> 18:10.584
But look.
And Xander is such a prince.

18:10.618 --> 18:12.252
Oh, a real prince.
He's so special.

18:12.286 --> 18:13.687
- Knock-knock!
- Hi.

18:13.721 --> 18:15.689
- Hey, you two.
- Hey.

18:15.723 --> 18:17.257
Dale and I were just ...
we were not watching anything.

18:17.291 --> 18:19.125
Hey. How are you?
Good. How are you?

18:19.160 --> 18:20.327
Good. How you doing? All right?
I'm good.

18:20.361 --> 18:22.028
Hi.
Mwah!

18:22.063 --> 18:23.330
Hi, Lace. Kids made that for you.
Hi. Aww.

18:23.364 --> 18:25.332
Little angels.

18:25.366 --> 18:26.933
Travis
likes to draw animals.

18:26.968 --> 18:28.802
And Katie ...
she's into clouds, so...

18:28.836 --> 18:30.370
It's perfect. I love it.

18:30.404 --> 18:31.972
Hey.

18:32.006 --> 18:34.841
Hey! How are you?
Good. How you doing?

18:34.876 --> 18:36.977
I'm good. Welcome to the,
uh, flower store.

18:37.011 --> 18:38.378
Honey, I'm gonna put these
over here, okay?

18:38.412 --> 18:40.180
How you feeling, Lace?
I am fine.

18:40.214 --> 18:41.548
I wish y'all would stop
worrying about me.

18:41.582 --> 18:42.982
Yeah, well,
that's not gonna happen.

18:42.984 --> 18:44.580
Listen ...
police are making progress,

18:44.581 --> 18:45.308
and, you know, we're ...

18:45.333 --> 18:46.920
Uh, excuse me ... I'm just
gonna do a quick exam,

18:46.921 --> 18:48.520
if your friends wouldn't mind
stepping aside for a second.

18:48.521 --> 18:49.021
Oh, sure.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.690
Uh, I'm gonna stay with my wife,
if that's all right.

18:50.691 --> 18:52.025
Of course.
Okay.

18:52.059 --> 18:54.661
Love you.
I love you, too.

18:57.198 --> 18:58.565
Hey. You said that you guys
made some progress.

18:58.599 --> 19:00.033
What did you find out?

19:00.067 --> 19:01.868
We're investigating
what this guy

19:01.903 --> 19:03.470
could have possibly
been looking for.

19:03.504 --> 19:05.639
Do you have anything
out of the ordinary

19:05.673 --> 19:08.341
that someone might
want to steal?

19:09.810 --> 19:11.778
Not that I can think of.

19:11.812 --> 19:14.981
And what about you?
Anything I should know about?

19:15.016 --> 19:16.616
What exactly
are you implying?

19:16.651 --> 19:17.884
Just that your past
might be coming back

19:17.919 --> 19:19.152
to bite you
in the ass.

19:19.186 --> 19:21.321
Hey, you know what,
both of you?

19:21.355 --> 19:22.489
It's about Lacey.

19:22.523 --> 19:24.724
We're following
every lead.

19:24.759 --> 19:27.894
I'll tell you the second
I know anything.

19:27.929 --> 19:30.330
Look.
I got to get to work.

19:30.364 --> 19:32.699
Can you pick up the kids from school?
I never should have listened to Sandoval.

19:32.733 --> 19:34.401
What are you
talking about?

19:34.435 --> 19:35.969
This has got to be
Vandermeyer.

19:36.003 --> 19:37.904
Why else would someone
try to break into the house?

19:37.939 --> 19:39.673
Kyle, this can't be
about your testimony

19:39.707 --> 19:41.207
or the police
would know about it.

19:41.242 --> 19:43.043
They ... they're following
Vandermeyer 24/7.

19:43.077 --> 19:44.711
They can't watch
all of his people.

19:44.745 --> 19:46.046
Vandermeyer
has got reach.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.414
That doesn't make
any sense.

19:47.448 --> 19:48.915
You're not even living
at the house right now.

19:48.950 --> 19:50.650
And if he wanted to find you,
he would find you.

19:50.685 --> 19:53.053
Look. I guess.

19:53.087 --> 19:54.688
Look ... all I know is that
if I did something

19:54.722 --> 19:56.523
to put Lacey
in the hospital,

19:56.557 --> 19:58.858
I'd never be
able to forgive myself.

20:02.797 --> 20:05.765
They're gonna find
this guy.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.401
It'll be okay.
Just pick up the kids.

20:20.815 --> 20:22.616
Look at you working
the accessories.

20:22.650 --> 20:25.051
Thanks.
It's my favorite scarf.

20:25.086 --> 20:26.886
Yeah, well, something's got
to keep that brain attached.

20:28.456 --> 20:32.425
Now that you mentioned it,
I did wear it for a reason.

20:32.460 --> 20:35.061
Oh, my lord.
Nikki's got a hickey.

20:35.096 --> 20:36.896
I haven't seen one of those
since middle school.

20:36.931 --> 20:40.867
In my neck of the woods,
we call them "love bites."

20:40.901 --> 20:42.302
Huh.

20:42.336 --> 20:44.738
Well, Nikki
with the hickey...

20:46.240 --> 20:49.075
...I didn't know, uh,
you were seeing someone.

20:49.110 --> 20:50.710
Oh. I'm not.

20:50.745 --> 20:52.145
I was hoping
we could date,

20:52.179 --> 20:54.280
but it just turned out to be
a fun-buddy thing.

20:54.315 --> 20:56.616
You little slut.

20:56.651 --> 20:57.617
What did you call me?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:57.652 --> 20:59.285
Oh, you heard me!

20:59.320 --> 21:01.621
You don't get to be fun buddies
with a guy I fun-buddy.

21:01.656 --> 21:03.456
Damn it! I can't stop
saying "fun buddy"!

21:03.491 --> 21:04.931
I didn't just
want to be fun buddies.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.326
But even if I did,
it's none of your business.

21:06.360 --> 21:07.921
Hey, hey, fun buddy's
still in the room.

21:07.928 --> 21:09.429
Please stop!
You tap that one more time,

21:09.463 --> 21:11.831
that'll be the last guy
you ever tap, you hear me?

21:11.866 --> 21:14.100
Whoa!
You can't tell me what to do.

21:14.135 --> 21:16.398
I will tap whoever I want to tap.
Not if I have anything to do with it!

21:16.399 --> 21:18.182
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on, come on!

21:18.183 --> 21:19.421
Hey, ladies, ladies, ladies!

21:19.446 --> 21:21.007
Hey, you both said no feelings
were gonna get hurt!

21:21.008 --> 21:22.409
This looks like
a lot of feelings!

21:22.443 --> 21:23.510
Hey!

21:23.544 --> 21:25.245
We have clients
out there.

21:25.279 --> 21:26.646
This ain't over.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:26.681 --> 21:29.115
No, ladies,
this is way more than over.

21:29.150 --> 21:31.584
Now, I know that I have seemed
distracted the last few days,

21:31.619 --> 21:32.558
but do not mistake that

21:32.583 --> 21:34.716
as me not knowing what's
going on around here.

21:35.189 --> 21:36.923
You can sleep with her
or you can sleep with her

21:36.957 --> 21:38.725
or the three of y'all can all
go off and sleep together.

21:38.759 --> 21:40.560
I don't really care. But it is
not gonna happen on my time.

21:40.594 --> 21:42.674
And it is certainly not gonna
happen here at the Rub.

21:42.697 --> 21:44.164
Listen, Riley. I'm so sorry.
No.

21:44.198 --> 21:45.398
Now, I'm not the fun police
here, okay?

21:45.433 --> 21:47.000
I am the money police,

21:47.034 --> 21:49.002
and this little thing
is keeping me from making money.

21:49.036 --> 21:50.117
Y'all understand that?
Fine.

21:50.137 --> 21:51.671
All right.
Yeah.

21:51.706 --> 21:54.307
Good! Now let's go make
some people happy!

21:54.341 --> 21:57.310
Whoa.

21:57.344 --> 22:00.613
Okay, okay. And for the record,
this has stopped being fun.

22:00.648 --> 22:02.816
Hey.
How you feeling today?

22:02.850 --> 22:04.250
Great.

22:04.285 --> 22:06.086
I went out
with Penny last night.

22:06.120 --> 22:09.089
Oh, yeah?
How's the courtship going?

22:09.123 --> 22:12.358
Third date and she hasn't
slammed the door in my face.

22:12.393 --> 22:16.996
She told me that I was
the most respectful man

22:17.031 --> 22:18.531
she's ever dated.

22:18.566 --> 22:20.333
Wow.

22:20.367 --> 22:21.601
I think
she might be the one.

22:21.635 --> 22:22.969
Well...

22:23.003 --> 22:25.305
Love is hard to come by,
so if you find it,

22:25.339 --> 22:27.707
you got to grab ahold of it
and hold on tight.

22:27.742 --> 22:28.842
Speaking of which ...

22:28.876 --> 22:30.844
Oh, uh, about that?

22:30.878 --> 22:32.479
From here on out,

22:32.513 --> 22:34.547
it's only legit massages
for me.

22:34.582 --> 22:37.350
As amazing
as you are ...

22:37.384 --> 22:39.052
and trust me,
you got the best hands

22:39.086 --> 22:40.520
on this side
of the border ...

22:40.554 --> 22:42.956
You only want to share that
with Penny.

22:42.990 --> 22:45.024
She's my dream girl.

22:45.059 --> 22:48.461
Is that crazy?

22:48.496 --> 22:52.265
No.
Not one little bit.

22:53.501 --> 22:55.502
Roll over.

23:00.207 --> 23:02.575
Oh, my God.
That's so good.

23:02.610 --> 23:03.877
Yeah?
Don't stop.

23:03.911 --> 23:05.845
Okay. At some point,
I do have to stop.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.515
Oh, no, don't stop.
That feels so good right there.

23:08.549 --> 23:09.649
Okay, my hands are...

23:09.683 --> 23:11.584
Am I interrupting?
Hey!

23:11.619 --> 23:13.153
Oh, hey. No. Come on in.
Oh, those are pretty.

23:13.187 --> 23:15.054
Thanks.
Uh, you know what?

23:15.089 --> 23:17.891
I'm gonna take a break.
You want any, uh, coffee?

23:17.925 --> 23:19.893
No, thank you.
But you know I love you.

23:19.927 --> 23:21.528
I love you more.

23:21.562 --> 23:22.896
You always have to win,
don't you?

23:22.930 --> 23:24.731
Bye.

23:24.765 --> 23:27.167
Hey.
Hey.

23:27.201 --> 23:28.568
I would have come sooner,

23:28.602 --> 23:30.336
but I was dropping Twinkle off
at her dad's.

23:30.371 --> 23:32.205
Well, no.
I'm glad you're here.

23:32.239 --> 23:34.007
Well, aren't these
just beautiful?

23:34.041 --> 23:35.875
Aren't they?
Riley brought those by.

23:35.910 --> 23:39.445
Bless her heart.
They are just so sweet.

23:41.649 --> 23:43.016
Much better.

23:44.051 --> 23:45.185
Hey!
Hey.

23:45.219 --> 23:47.187
Oh. Hi, Taylor.
Hi.

23:47.221 --> 23:48.788
It's a girls' night out.
You bring the margaritas?

23:50.257 --> 23:51.958
Oh, my God ...
hey, I hope that Inez

23:51.992 --> 23:53.529
is still not sitting
underneath that dryer.

23:53.554 --> 23:54.394
Oh, honey.

23:54.395 --> 23:56.429
She's gonna learn
to love that color.

23:58.299 --> 24:00.233
Oh. Ow.
Oh, my God.

24:00.267 --> 24:01.634
Are you okay?
Aah!

24:01.669 --> 24:03.136
Oh, my God!
Oh!

24:03.170 --> 24:04.204
Something's wrong.
Oh, my God!

24:04.238 --> 24:06.272
Hold on!
Just breathe.

24:06.307 --> 24:07.574
Oh, God.

24:07.608 --> 24:08.708
Hey, excuse me!

24:08.742 --> 24:10.210
We're gonna need a doctor
in here!

24:12.413 --> 24:14.080
Aah!
Something's wrong!

24:14.114 --> 24:15.748
I'm right here. I'm right here.
Ooh! Ow!

24:15.783 --> 24:17.784
Doctor, the baby's
showing signs of distress.

24:17.818 --> 24:20.486
It could be placenta abruptio.
Ow! Ow!

24:20.521 --> 24:21.921
It's gonna be okay.

24:21.956 --> 24:23.823
What's going on?!

24:23.858 --> 24:25.778
Get them out of here now!
Lacey! I'm her husband.

24:25.793 --> 24:28.628
Ooh.
All right, Lacey. We got it.

24:28.662 --> 24:30.630
What happened?
Please just let him stay.

24:30.664 --> 24:32.532
Lacey!
Lacey!

24:40.546 --> 24:42.813
Hey.

24:42.848 --> 24:45.155
I'm so sorry
about the baby.

24:45.156 --> 24:46.857
I'll give y'all
some privacy.

24:46.891 --> 24:49.059
Thank you.

24:49.093 --> 24:50.894
I am so sorry
this is happening.

24:52.363 --> 24:55.165
Come here. It's okay.

24:55.199 --> 24:57.000
She's gonna be okay, right?

24:57.034 --> 24:58.201
She'll be okay.

25:06.544 --> 25:08.278
You can see her now.

25:10.448 --> 25:13.250
You got to be brave,
right?

25:13.284 --> 25:15.685
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.

25:15.720 --> 25:18.321
Come on.

25:18.356 --> 25:20.657
The sedation
should wear off shortly.

25:20.691 --> 25:22.525
She is going to be fine.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.527
Thank you.

25:24.562 --> 25:28.098
You hear that, Wonder Woman?
You're gonna be just fine.

25:31.202 --> 25:33.169
Dale.

25:33.204 --> 25:36.373
Yeah, sweetie,
I'm right here.

25:36.407 --> 25:37.741
The baby.

25:44.248 --> 25:46.650
I'm gonna try real hard.

25:48.586 --> 25:50.754
And when we're ready,
we're gonna try again.

25:50.788 --> 25:53.757
No.

25:53.791 --> 25:55.458
Come here.

25:55.493 --> 26:00.363
We're right here,
and we love you.

26:00.398 --> 26:02.198
She...

26:02.233 --> 26:05.568
She didn't even
have a name.

26:10.241 --> 26:12.409
Lacey, I promise you,
no matter what I have to do

26:12.443 --> 26:15.045
or how long
it takes me...

26:15.079 --> 26:18.648
I'm gonna make this right.

26:21.185 --> 26:24.421
Hey! Why haven't you found
this guy yet?

26:25.957 --> 26:27.791
Calm down.
No. It's been three days.

26:27.825 --> 26:29.459
He could be halfway
to California.

26:29.493 --> 26:30.893
Hey, could you
take it down a notch?

26:33.597 --> 26:35.165
Lacey just lost her baby
because of this son of a bitch.

26:35.199 --> 26:36.766
She what?

26:36.801 --> 26:38.801
I-I didn't even know she ...
Yeah, well, now you do,

26:38.803 --> 26:41.371
so please don't tell me
to calm down.

26:42.807 --> 26:44.341
All right.

26:44.375 --> 26:46.843
Come here.

26:47.945 --> 26:50.914
We cross-referenced
the license-plate info

26:50.948 --> 26:52.315
with all the Caddys
in the county,

26:52.350 --> 26:54.584
and we came up with
three possible suspects.

26:54.618 --> 26:56.419
Now, none of them
are at their last known address,

26:56.454 --> 26:58.922
but one of them matches
Lacey's description.

26:58.956 --> 27:00.457
This has
got to be the guy.

27:00.491 --> 27:02.292
This is who
we're trying to find.

27:02.326 --> 27:04.427
Yeah, when are you gonna
stop trying to find him, Evan,

27:04.462 --> 27:06.096
and just go
and get him?

27:06.130 --> 27:07.497
We have to follow protocol.
Excuse me. Evan.

27:07.531 --> 27:08.765
Screw your protocol.

27:08.799 --> 27:10.834
Okay?
Look, that is the guy.

27:10.868 --> 27:13.069
He's got a scar
on his cheek.

27:13.104 --> 27:14.671
Now go and get him.
I am on top of this.

27:14.705 --> 27:16.306
Evan!

27:16.340 --> 27:18.408
The watch commander wants us
in his office now.

27:18.442 --> 27:20.610
Trust me.

27:38.229 --> 27:41.331
Sean Foster.
Ever heard of him?

27:41.365 --> 27:43.867
I can't say that I have.
Why?

27:43.901 --> 27:45.268
He's the guy
that attacked Lacey,

27:45.302 --> 27:46.536
and the police
can't find him.

27:46.570 --> 27:48.538
Never thought
I'd be saying this,

27:48.572 --> 27:49.973
but now is the time

27:50.007 --> 27:52.275
that you should let
the police do their job.

27:52.309 --> 27:55.612
Yeah, but they're not doing
their job, Georgia. That's...

27:55.646 --> 27:56.813
That's the problem.

27:56.847 --> 27:59.149
Look, I hate to ask,
but I just...

27:59.183 --> 28:02.152
I want to be able to
tell them where he is

28:02.186 --> 28:04.320
so that they can go
and take him in.

28:04.355 --> 28:06.423
Well, I can't make you
any promises,

28:06.457 --> 28:08.925
but I'm gonna do some digging.
Thank you.

28:08.959 --> 28:10.760
Hey.

28:10.795 --> 28:12.495
I promise you that if
he was after the client list,

28:12.530 --> 28:13.963
I'm gonna take
the fall, okay?

28:13.998 --> 28:15.799
Nobody else is getting hurt
because of me.

28:15.833 --> 28:19.135
Client list? What client list?
I never heard of a client list.

28:19.170 --> 28:20.770
And as far
as I'm concerned,

28:20.805 --> 28:25.341
this Foster's just some lowlife
trying to make up a story.

28:28.679 --> 28:31.481
Do I have to do your job
for you?

28:31.515 --> 28:33.149
Fix it!

28:41.525 --> 28:43.059
If you ever come near my home
and my family again,

28:43.094 --> 28:44.561
I will snap your neck.

28:44.595 --> 28:45.795
I don't know what
you're talking about, Parks.

28:45.830 --> 28:47.063
Oh, like hell
you don't.

28:47.098 --> 28:48.832
You broke into my house.

28:48.866 --> 28:50.166
Don't play games, Kyle.

28:50.201 --> 28:51.668
If I'd have wanted to
mess with you,

28:51.702 --> 28:53.069
I'd have made
a phone call.

28:53.104 --> 28:54.838
And if I wanted you dead,
trust me ...

28:54.872 --> 28:56.739
you wouldn't have woken up
this morning.

28:56.774 --> 28:58.541
You think I'm scared of you,
Vandermeyer?

28:58.576 --> 29:02.812
If anybody should be scared,
it's you.

29:02.847 --> 29:06.583
Always a pleasure chatting
with you, Kyle.

29:06.617 --> 29:08.418
I'll see you in court.

29:42.419 --> 29:43.686
Officer Parks.

29:43.721 --> 29:45.522
Hey.
Evan, it's me, Riley.

29:45.556 --> 29:49.192
Listen, I am at, uh...
4835 Kling Street.

29:49.226 --> 29:52.028
What's going on?
Sean Foster, the guy that attacked Lacey ...

29:52.062 --> 29:53.997
I'm looking at him
right now.

29:54.031 --> 29:55.398
Don't
do anything stupid.

29:55.432 --> 29:57.033
Look, I am just gonna
keep an eye on him

29:57.067 --> 29:58.835
until you guys get here
and arrest him, okay?

29:58.869 --> 30:01.004
There is no way in hell this
guy's getting away with this.

30:01.038 --> 30:03.339
Riley.
Look, are you gonna help me or not?

30:03.374 --> 30:07.177
4835 Kling. Just stay
in your truck, all right?

30:07.211 --> 30:09.179
I'll get there
as fast as I can.

30:09.213 --> 30:10.547
Riley's in trouble?

30:10.581 --> 30:11.714
Not yet,
but we got to go.

30:34.038 --> 30:36.606
Oh, no.
You are not leaving.

30:36.640 --> 30:39.042
# Got to get my mind clear

30:39.076 --> 30:41.044
# got nothing to lose

30:41.078 --> 30:42.879
# got to get my pink stray

30:42.913 --> 30:45.481
# jazz away them blues

30:45.516 --> 30:47.684
# still got my fake, yeah

30:47.718 --> 30:50.153
# But it's getting loud

30:50.187 --> 30:52.155
# now all these voices

30:52.189 --> 30:53.990
# Keep spinning 'round
uh, excuse me.

30:54.024 --> 30:56.392
Hi.

30:56.427 --> 30:58.328
Could you help me
for a sec?

30:58.362 --> 31:00.396
What can I do
for you?

31:00.431 --> 31:02.899
Oh, well, the thing is ...
I am all turned around.

31:04.201 --> 31:05.435
Do you know
where Sapphire Road is?

31:05.469 --> 31:07.237
Wow.
Do you live here?

31:07.271 --> 31:09.706
No, I'm just crashing
with a friend.

31:09.740 --> 31:13.876
Really?
She is a lucky lady.

31:15.012 --> 31:17.046
Uh, he's not as cute
as you.

31:18.182 --> 31:19.649
I've never heard
of Sapphire,

31:19.683 --> 31:20.817
but there's a Stop 'n Shop
down the block ...

31:20.851 --> 31:22.285
maybe they can help.

31:22.319 --> 31:24.520
Oh, but they're not gonna be
as helpful as you are.

31:24.555 --> 31:26.956
# I'm holding on too tight,
now #

31:26.991 --> 31:30.226
Uh, I'm sorry, babe,
but I got to get going.

31:30.261 --> 31:31.494
Oh,
that is a shame.

31:31.528 --> 31:33.396
I mean, you are just
the kind of guy

31:33.430 --> 31:36.399
I'd like to get to know.

31:36.433 --> 31:38.635
As good as that sounds,

31:38.669 --> 31:40.303
I got a long drive
ahead of me.

31:40.337 --> 31:42.138
Really?
You're gonna leave...

31:42.172 --> 31:43.373
In rush hour?

31:43.407 --> 31:46.142
Come on.
Let's go get a drink.

31:50.347 --> 31:52.515
I really
got to get going.

31:52.549 --> 31:53.783
Maybe next time.

31:54.451 --> 31:56.152
You're not going
anywhere, asshole.

31:56.186 --> 31:57.420
Aah!

32:07.631 --> 32:10.133
Hands, hands, hands!
Hands!

32:10.167 --> 32:11.367
Let me see your hands!
Hands!

32:11.402 --> 32:12.602
Get out of the car!

32:12.636 --> 32:13.736
My leg!
Now!

32:13.771 --> 32:16.506
Got it! I got it!
My leg!

32:18.142 --> 32:19.642
Ow!

32:22.579 --> 32:24.714
Come on!

32:38.339 --> 32:40.012
Well, I had a feeling
you were up to something

32:40.013 --> 32:41.880
when you stormed
out of the station today.

32:41.915 --> 32:43.782
I didn't storm out.
I walked out forcefully.

32:43.817 --> 32:45.084
Hey ...
what I want to know

32:45.118 --> 32:46.819
is how you found out
where Foster was.

32:46.853 --> 32:48.387
It's not for you
to know, okay?

32:48.421 --> 32:50.055
I just got tired
of waiting on you.

32:50.090 --> 32:51.457
Have you gone crazy?

32:51.491 --> 32:54.226
That guy is a criminal.
You have a family, kids.

32:54.261 --> 32:56.295
You think I don't know that?
I don't know what you're thinking!

32:56.329 --> 32:58.597
You could have gotten
yourself killed.

32:58.632 --> 33:01.133
You know what I was thinking?
Hurt the guy that hurt Lacey.

33:02.802 --> 33:04.770
Just promise me you will not
pull a stunt like that again.

33:04.804 --> 33:07.906
It's my family, Evan.
I'll do whatever I have to do.

33:10.110 --> 33:11.644
Evan.

33:15.448 --> 33:17.049
Thank you.

33:31.064 --> 33:33.098
Oh, my God.
Thank God you're home.

33:33.133 --> 33:34.667
Evan told you what happened?
Yes.

33:34.701 --> 33:36.201
He called me when I picked
the kids up from school.

33:36.236 --> 33:38.270
Look, I know what I did
was foolish.

33:38.305 --> 33:39.371
It was beyond foolish.

33:41.341 --> 33:42.841
Come on, Riley. What were you
doing? You could have come to me.

33:42.876 --> 33:44.777
I'm your husband.
It's my job to protect you.

33:44.811 --> 33:47.492
Okay, I'm sorry. I guess I've just
gotten used to protecting myself.

33:49.416 --> 33:52.017
Look ... I'm not the same girl
that I was when you left.

33:52.052 --> 33:53.986
B-but this was my problem
to fix.

33:56.323 --> 33:59.191
I went and I saw Vandermeyer today.
Y-you what?

33:59.225 --> 34:00.859
But he's not gonna be bothering us anymore,
all right? Don't worry.

34:00.894 --> 34:02.728
No, of course
I'm gonna worry, Kyle.

34:02.762 --> 34:04.663
I mean, come on ...
if the police knew

34:04.698 --> 34:06.999
that you were even 10 yards
from Vandermeyer ...

34:07.033 --> 34:08.300
and, by the way,
how do you even know

34:08.335 --> 34:09.702
that he has something
to do with this?

34:09.735 --> 34:11.337
Honestly, I don't.

34:11.371 --> 34:13.038
I don't, but I couldn't
just sit here and do nothing.

34:13.072 --> 34:15.174
Kyle, look,
I need you here...

34:15.208 --> 34:17.909
Okay?

34:17.944 --> 34:20.512
For the kids...for me.

34:22.415 --> 34:25.583
I mean, we worked so hard
to get you out of there.

34:25.618 --> 34:27.686
Please don't throw
that away.

34:27.721 --> 34:31.322
All right.

34:31.358 --> 34:33.025
All right, I get it.

34:35.061 --> 34:37.529
Is there anything else
I can do for you now?

34:40.100 --> 34:42.900
Do you mind
just staying on the sofa?

34:42.936 --> 34:45.404
Of course I will.

34:47.139 --> 34:49.375
I want to be here
for you.

35:15.168 --> 35:17.169
Good night.

35:22.108 --> 35:24.276
Not now, Shelby.

35:24.310 --> 35:27.479
Evan, you're gonna
have to talk to me.

35:27.514 --> 35:29.281
I'm right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

35:29.315 --> 35:31.917
I've had it.
I am done with Riley.

35:31.951 --> 35:33.318
What did she say to you
back there?

35:33.353 --> 35:35.120
Nothing she hasn't said
a million times before.

35:35.155 --> 35:38.724
I just can't believe it's taken
me this long to get it.

35:38.758 --> 35:40.058
Don't beat yourself up.

35:40.093 --> 35:41.960
Riley's family.
Family's gonna be tough.

35:41.995 --> 35:43.228
You don't understand.

35:43.263 --> 35:44.897
She doesn't respect me.

35:44.931 --> 35:47.499
Every time she's needed me,
I've been there for her.

35:47.534 --> 35:48.667
But no more!

35:48.701 --> 35:50.502
You don't mean that.
Yes, I do!

35:50.537 --> 35:52.571
I am tired
of being her errand boy!

35:52.605 --> 35:54.072
You have every right
to be upset.

35:54.107 --> 35:55.307
You're damn right I do!

35:55.341 --> 35:56.775
So, what do you want?

35:56.810 --> 35:59.511
I want you.

35:59.546 --> 36:03.749
Don't say that because
you're mad at Riley.

36:03.783 --> 36:06.151
I've never been more sure

36:06.186 --> 36:08.053
about anything
in my entire life.

36:23.236 --> 36:24.703
Oh, thank you so much.

36:24.737 --> 36:27.539
Now, you can just take that
on back, please. Mm-hmm.

36:27.574 --> 36:29.541
Love the smell
of this vanilla-bean coffee.

36:29.576 --> 36:31.376
Hey.
Hey!

36:31.411 --> 36:33.111
I just wanted to come by
and say thank you

36:33.146 --> 36:34.546
for helping me
with Lacey,

36:34.581 --> 36:36.782
and we'd have never
found Foster without you.

36:36.816 --> 36:38.450
By the way, how did you?

36:38.485 --> 36:39.818
Well, I made a call

36:39.853 --> 36:42.654
to a friend
in the U.S. Marshal's office.

36:42.689 --> 36:44.289
Oh, they can take down
anyone.

36:44.324 --> 36:45.891
You know,
the local police ...

36:45.925 --> 36:47.726
sometimes
they're just too prideful

36:47.760 --> 36:48.994
to admit they need help.

36:49.028 --> 36:50.496
Oh, you can say that
again.

36:50.530 --> 36:52.698
I just never
in my wildest dream

36:52.732 --> 36:54.366
expected you
to go after Foster.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.035
I thought you were gonna give
his address to the police.

36:57.070 --> 36:58.804
Well, I couldn't let him
get away,

36:58.838 --> 37:00.739
especially with all this
being my fault.

37:00.773 --> 37:03.709
This was not your fault.
You hear me?

37:03.743 --> 37:04.877
I hear you.

37:04.911 --> 37:06.745
Having a hard time
believing it.

37:06.779 --> 37:09.181
Well, just give it
some time.

37:09.215 --> 37:10.382
Okay.

37:10.416 --> 37:13.418
Oh, sugar.
Yep?

37:13.453 --> 37:15.821
Return that bridesmaid's dress.

37:15.855 --> 37:18.223
I've been rethinking
the look of my wedding.

37:18.258 --> 37:19.858
Oh, Georgia,
thank God!

37:19.893 --> 37:21.260
I mean...

37:21.294 --> 37:23.395
Why?
'Cause it was so pretty.

37:24.564 --> 37:27.366
You are a worse liar
than I am.

37:27.400 --> 37:28.767
Well...

37:28.801 --> 37:30.402
You know, I was looking
at all those big gowns,

37:30.436 --> 37:31.703
and I realize...

37:31.738 --> 37:33.105
That's what I did
in my first wedding,

37:33.139 --> 37:35.340
and look how well
that turned out.

37:35.375 --> 37:36.675
Ooh, true.

37:36.709 --> 37:38.644
No, I am wearing
the dress I wore...

37:38.678 --> 37:41.013
the day I met Harold.

37:41.047 --> 37:43.015
He loves me for me,

37:43.049 --> 37:46.852
and I want my wedding day
to be only about that ...

37:46.886 --> 37:48.086
love.

37:48.121 --> 37:50.088
That's nice.

37:50.123 --> 37:52.524
Okay, enough about you.
What am I gonna wear?

37:52.559 --> 37:55.727
Well,
a dress that makes you happy.

37:55.762 --> 37:57.563
You know,
one that you'd wear forever,

37:57.597 --> 38:01.199
so it can remind you of
the happiest day of my life.

38:02.569 --> 38:06.004
Oh, well, fancy.
I love you.

38:06.039 --> 38:07.706
I love you, too.

38:07.740 --> 38:09.007
Okay,
sweats and high heels ...

38:09.042 --> 38:10.208
that's what
I'm gonna be wearing.

38:17.750 --> 38:19.351
What are you doing?

38:19.385 --> 38:21.086
Making money.

38:21.120 --> 38:24.089
Wait just a damn min... you just
sold my virginity purse?

38:24.123 --> 38:26.043
You use that word like
it means something to you.

38:26.059 --> 38:29.628
Besides, I just made
a $247 profit.

38:29.662 --> 38:30.963
Can you believe this?!

38:30.997 --> 38:32.598
Don't look at me.

38:32.632 --> 38:34.933
All right, give it. Give it. Come on.
No!

38:34.968 --> 38:36.888
Ladies, hey, don't fight! Shh! Shh! Shh!
Give it!

38:36.903 --> 38:38.270
Look! Wait!
I'll buy it back, okay?

38:38.304 --> 38:40.138
You can't.
Bidding's over.

38:40.173 --> 38:42.374
She stole my purse
out from under me.

38:42.408 --> 38:45.811
Hmm. You know,
this ain't right.

38:45.845 --> 38:47.946
And just to let y'all know,
whoever gets that purse

38:47.981 --> 38:50.882
has got some bad karma
coming to them, okay?

38:50.917 --> 38:52.884
If you say so.

38:52.919 --> 38:56.321
Hope your mom
enjoys her purse.

38:58.992 --> 39:02.461
Oh. Well, thanks
for taking her side.

39:02.495 --> 39:04.730
Hey, I got you
a little something.

39:04.764 --> 39:07.232
What about your mama?

39:07.266 --> 39:09.401
What Nikki don't know
won't kill her.

39:09.435 --> 39:11.837
Really?

39:11.871 --> 39:14.873
Mm-hmm.

39:17.777 --> 39:20.579
You know, that thing
I said about karma, well...

39:20.613 --> 39:21.780
I take it back.

39:25.184 --> 39:28.353
Oh, heavenly father...

39:28.388 --> 39:31.356
I know I've strayed,
but everything I've done...

39:31.391 --> 39:33.458
Has been to protect my family.

39:33.493 --> 39:35.360
Tell me what to do.

39:35.395 --> 39:37.562
I'm so torn.
Hi.

39:38.631 --> 39:40.198
You guys feel like
a visitor?

39:40.233 --> 39:41.633
Always.
Yeah, of course.

39:41.668 --> 39:43.035
Hey, you know what?

39:43.069 --> 39:44.770
This is a good time for me
to go home...

39:44.804 --> 39:47.439
And take a shower and get out
of these clothes, okay?

39:47.473 --> 39:50.275
Oh, please do.
You smell rank.

39:50.309 --> 39:52.711
Oh, wow.
You are the charmer.

39:52.745 --> 39:56.982
Hey. We're Locklins,
all right?

39:57.016 --> 39:59.184
You are my number-one girl,
for better, for worse.

39:59.218 --> 40:01.853
Always have been,
always will be.

40:09.929 --> 40:11.730
Oh, my God,
I love him.

40:11.764 --> 40:13.965
I know. Me too.

40:14.000 --> 40:19.371
Here. Okay.
So, tell me the truth.

40:19.405 --> 40:21.373
How are you feeling?

40:21.407 --> 40:22.841
Not good.

40:22.875 --> 40:25.077
That's what I thought.
That's why I'm here.

40:26.913 --> 40:29.514
Did you really go all Rambo
on that guy for me?

40:29.549 --> 40:32.718
Oh, yeah, you know.
Anything for my sister.

40:32.752 --> 40:34.553
That's kind of awesome.

40:35.588 --> 40:37.189
Really dumb.

40:37.223 --> 40:39.591
You pull that crap again,
I will whup your ass.

40:39.625 --> 40:41.226
You know I can.

40:41.260 --> 40:42.694
Well...

40:44.397 --> 40:45.764
Oh, my God!

40:45.798 --> 40:47.766
Is this
"Brothers and Lovers?"

40:47.800 --> 40:51.236
Oh, yeah.
Oh, turn it up.

40:51.270 --> 40:54.072
Dearest father,
I need your guidance.

40:54.107 --> 40:56.408
Is it wrong
that I love both brothers?

40:56.442 --> 40:58.243
Been there,
done that.

40:58.277 --> 41:00.445
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

41:00.480 --> 41:01.801
Tell me what to do.

41:01.814 --> 41:04.382
Cassandra.
Xander.

41:04.417 --> 41:08.086
I love you
more than life itself.

41:08.121 --> 41:10.722
God, this is so bad
yet so good.

41:10.757 --> 41:12.724
Simon will kill you.
Yep. Mm.

41:12.759 --> 41:15.393
I want to see
how they end it.
