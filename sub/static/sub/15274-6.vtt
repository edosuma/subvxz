WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:04.002
HELLO!

00:04.003 --> 00:06.014
MOMMY, MOMMY, HELP ME!
CLAIRE'S TRYING TO KILL ME!

00:06.006 --> 00:08.006
COME HERE, YOU LITTLE RUNT.
WHEN I GET MY HANDS ON YOU,

00:08.007 --> 00:09.218
I'M GOING TO --

00:09.220 --> 00:11.090
YOU'RE GOING TO WHAT?

00:11.092 --> 00:13.092
SHE WAS USING
MY BOBBI BROWN EYELINER

00:13.094 --> 00:14.104
TO DRAW WITH.

00:14.095 --> 00:15.475
I WAS COLORING,

00:15.476 --> 00:18.516
AND I NEEDED TO MAKE
THE MONSTER UGLY.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.019
IT WORKS FOR CLAIRE.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.690
STOP IT!

00:24.145 --> 00:25.355
NOW WHAT DID YOUR DADDY
TELL YOU

00:25.356 --> 00:27.146
ABOUT GOING THROUGH
YOUR SISTER'S THINGS?

00:27.148 --> 00:28.028
DON'T GET CAUGHT.

00:30.241 --> 00:32.201
HE DID.

00:32.203 --> 00:34.033
GO UPSTAIRS.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.124
YOU, OVER HERE.

00:36.117 --> 00:37.537
CLAIRE,

00:37.538 --> 00:39.918
YOU ARE 12 YEARS OLD.
YOUR SISTER JUST TURNED 5.

00:39.920 --> 00:41.710
I DON'T WANT YOU
THREATENING HER LIFE

00:41.712 --> 00:43.332
FOR AT LEAST
ANOTHER THREE YEARS.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.014
CAN I GO NOW?

00:45.005 --> 00:47.255
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?
NOTHING.

00:47.258 --> 00:48.508
DON'T TELL ME NOTHING.

00:48.509 --> 00:50.509
YOU'VE BEEN IN A FUNKY MOOD
FOR DAYS.

00:50.511 --> 00:51.721
I AM 12 YEARS OLD

00:51.722 --> 00:54.142
AND YOU KEEP TREATING ME
LIKE I'M A LITTLE KID.

00:54.135 --> 00:55.475
OKAY, I'M LOST.

00:55.476 --> 00:58.096
DID I NOT JUST TELL YOU
TO ACT LIKE AN ADULT

00:58.099 --> 00:59.229
WITH YOUR SISTER?

00:59.230 --> 01:01.890
DO YOU KNOW THAT
EVERYBODY IN MY CLASS

01:01.892 --> 01:03.442
HAS A 9:00 WEEKEND CURFEW?

01:03.444 --> 01:06.284
AND I HAVE TO BE IN BY 7:00,
LIKE I'M A CHILD.

01:06.277 --> 01:08.277
WELL, YOU'RE CERTAINLY
ACTING LIKE A CHILD,

01:08.279 --> 01:09.109
AREN'T YOU, CLAIRE?

01:09.110 --> 01:11.490
HEY.
HOW YOU GUYS DOING?

01:11.492 --> 01:13.032
HI, DADDY.

01:13.033 --> 01:15.413
WHAT, NO HUGS, NO KISS,
NO BACK FLIPS?

01:15.406 --> 01:18.496
I'M SORRY, DADDY.

01:18.499 --> 01:19.999
NOW I FEEL LOVED.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.250
SO DO I.

01:21.252 --> 01:23.332
I LOVE YOU, DADDY.
I LOVE YOU, TOO, BABY.

01:23.334 --> 01:25.304
HOW ABOUT ME?
GOODBYE.

01:27.208 --> 01:29.878
WHAT ABOUT MY OTHER GIRL?
COME ON, THERE'S ROOM LEFT.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.300
STAY AWAY FROM ME.

01:31.302 --> 01:33.422
WHAT, I CAN'T
GET A HUG?
NO.

01:33.424 --> 01:35.274
CAN I SQUEEZE
YOUR BUTT?

01:35.266 --> 01:36.976
NO!

01:36.977 --> 01:38.057
WHY NOT?

01:38.058 --> 01:40.558
BECAUSE YOUR CHILDREN
ARE DRIVING ME CRAZY.

01:40.561 --> 01:42.681
OH, THEY'RE
MY CHILDREN NOW.

01:42.683 --> 01:44.443
YEAH, WHEN THEY ACT
LIKE THIS, THEY ARE.

01:44.435 --> 01:46.065
COME ON, BABY,
GIVE ME A HUG.

01:46.066 --> 01:48.226
NO, MICHAEL,
I DON'T WANT TO.
WHY NOT?

01:48.229 --> 01:51.229
BECAUSE THEY LOOK
JUST LIKE YOU.

01:51.232 --> 01:54.452
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

01:54.445 --> 01:56.325
OKAY. WELL, I CAN'T SEEM
TO TELL

01:56.327 --> 01:57.827
LITTLE MISS ATTITUDE
ANYTHING.

01:57.828 --> 01:59.198
SHE THINKS
SHE KNOWS IT ALL.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.580
AND LOOK -- LOOK WHAT CAME
IN THE MAIL TODAY.

02:01.582 --> 02:03.332
YOUR SON'S LATEST
TEST SCORES.

02:03.334 --> 02:05.924
WOW, A 61.
THAT'S NOT BAD.

02:05.916 --> 02:08.376
NO, NO, BABY, NO.
NO, NO.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.628
19?

02:09.630 --> 02:12.130
OUT OF 100?

02:12.132 --> 02:14.642
WHAT ON EARTH COULD BE WRONG
WITH THAT BOY, MICHAEL?

02:14.635 --> 02:17.175
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GET
AN "A" ON HIS ALGEBRA FINAL

02:17.178 --> 02:19.258
JUST SO HE CAN AVOID
SUMMER SCHOOL.

02:19.260 --> 02:21.470
WELL, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE HE'S DOING HIS BEST.

02:21.472 --> 02:23.312
I'M SORRY.
IF HE WERE DOING HIS BEST,

02:23.314 --> 02:24.534
HE'D GET HIGHER THAN 19.

02:24.525 --> 02:27.145
NOT IF HE'S STUPID.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.227
HE'S NOT STUPID.

02:29.230 --> 02:31.150
I'M NOT TALKING
GEORGE W. STUPID.

02:33.234 --> 02:35.164
I WAS TERRIBLE AT MATH.
I HAVE A G.E.D.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.985
I DIDN'T EVEN FINISH
HIGH SCHOOL.

02:36.987 --> 02:38.237
I'M SORRY, MICHAEL.

02:38.239 --> 02:39.779
I JUST REFUSE TO BELIEVE
THE BOY CAN'T LEARN.

02:39.780 --> 02:41.450
I JUST THINK HE NEEDS
TO BE MOTIVATED.

02:41.452 --> 02:43.582
WHAT? WE TOOK THE TELEVISION
OUT OF HIS ROOM.

02:43.584 --> 02:45.384
HE CAN'T GO OUT
ON SCHOOL NIGHTS.

02:45.376 --> 02:47.376
WE EVEN TOOK ALL THE LOTION
OUT OF THE BATHROOM.

02:49.790 --> 02:51.250
WHAT ELSE IS THERE?

02:51.252 --> 02:54.602
MICHAEL, ONE OF US
IS GOING TO HAVE TO TALK TO HIM.

02:54.595 --> 02:56.135
ONE OF US, HUH?

02:56.136 --> 02:57.136
MM-HMM.

02:57.137 --> 02:58.177
ALL RIGHT.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.638
YOU CALL IT.

03:01.392 --> 03:02.262
HEADS.

03:03.354 --> 03:04.524
GOOD LUCK.

03:24.785 --> 03:26.535
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:26.537 --> 03:29.287
I'M JUST KEEPING
IN PRACTICE.

03:29.290 --> 03:32.330
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE
MY EDGE.

03:32.333 --> 03:35.053
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MATH EDGE?
WHAT ABOUT IT?

03:35.045 --> 03:37.595
WHAT ABOUT DEVELOPING ONE?

03:37.598 --> 03:40.258
IT'S NOT REALLY MY BAG.
IT'S TOO TOUGH.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.181
YEAH, SEE,
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD YOUR MOM.

03:42.182 --> 03:44.352
SHE THINKS IT'S 'CAUSE
YOU'RE NOT MOTIVATED.

03:44.345 --> 03:45.475
BUT YOU AND I BOTH KNOW

03:45.476 --> 03:47.106
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
VERY BRIGHT.

03:47.107 --> 03:49.437
YOU GOT IT, DAD.

03:50.851 --> 03:52.851
YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW THAT?

03:52.853 --> 03:53.943
HOW?

03:53.944 --> 03:56.494
BECAUSE I BET IF I
OFFERED YOU $1,000

03:56.487 --> 03:59.317
TO GET AN "A"
ON YOUR ALGEBRA FINAL,

03:59.320 --> 04:01.780
IT WOULDN'T MAKE
A DIFFERENCE.

04:01.782 --> 04:04.582
IT WOULDN'T?

04:04.575 --> 04:07.205
NO. I MEAN, YOU'RE ALREADY
DOING YOUR BEST,

04:07.207 --> 04:09.537
AND YOU CAN'T DO BETTER
THAN YOUR BEST.

04:09.540 --> 04:12.330
WELL, I SUPPOSE I COULD TRY
A LITTLE HARDER.

04:12.333 --> 04:14.433
YOU THINK?
HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT?

04:14.425 --> 04:16.175
I COULD TRY TO FIND
MY TEXTBOOK.

04:16.176 --> 04:19.216
DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD
MAKE A DIFFERENCE?

04:19.219 --> 04:21.009
THERE'S NO HURT IN TRYING.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.881
GOOD.

04:23.884 --> 04:25.484
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS, DAD?

04:25.476 --> 04:27.686
WELL, SON,
YOUR FAILURE AT ALGEBRA

04:27.688 --> 04:29.598
IS STARTING TO AFFECT
MY LIFE.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.770
IT'S MAKING YOUR MOTHER
VERY UNHAPPY.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.022
AND WHEN SHE'S UNHAPPY,
I'M UNHAPPY

04:34.024 --> 04:36.404
'CAUSE MR. HAPPY
AIN'T GETTING HAPPY.

04:37.738 --> 04:38.608
OKAY?

04:38.609 --> 04:39.949
SO WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO DO

04:39.950 --> 04:41.900
IS WE'RE GOING TO KEEP
THIS DEAL TO OURSELVES

04:41.902 --> 04:43.702
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO APPLY YOURSELF.

04:43.704 --> 04:45.504
OKAY?
OKAY.

04:45.496 --> 04:47.996
NOW I'M GOING
TO PRETEND TO YELL AT YOU,

04:47.998 --> 04:50.788
AND YOU ACT LIKE
I RAKED YOU OVER THE COALS.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.711
THESE GRADES ARE UNACCEPTABLE,
MICHAEL RICHARD KYLE!

04:53.714 --> 04:55.634
NOW YOU GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER,

04:55.626 --> 04:57.836
OR I'M GOING TO BREAK
YOUR ACT IN HALF!

04:57.838 --> 04:59.088
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!

04:59.089 --> 05:00.759
[ DOOR SLAMS ]

05:20.030 --> 05:22.320
HEY, BABY.
HOW WAS DANCE CLASS?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.572
OKAY.

05:23.574 --> 05:25.754
DID YOU LEARN
ANY NEW STEPS?
NO.

05:25.746 --> 05:26.996
MONEY WELL SPENT.

05:26.997 --> 05:29.617
I HAVE TO GO WORK
ON MY SCIENCE PROJECT.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.710
OH, I COULD HELP YOU
WITH THAT.

05:31.712 --> 05:33.042
NO, THANKS.

05:33.043 --> 05:35.553
Michael:
HEY, I'M HOME.
DADDY!

05:38.629 --> 05:39.759
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

05:39.760 --> 05:41.340
DADDY, IT WAS GREAT.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.131
I LEARNED THIS NEW STEP
AT DANCE CLASS,

05:44.134 --> 05:46.354
AND I HAVE THIS
AWESOME SCIENCE PROJECT.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.386
COULD YOU HELP ME WITH IT?
I'D LOVE TO.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.060
Y-YOU GO AHEAD, CLAIRE.
YOUR FATHER AND I

05:51.061 --> 05:52.641
HAVE A FEW THINGS
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.983
I LOVE YOU, DADDY.
I LOVE YOU, TOO, BABY.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.397
THAT'S A GREAT KID, HUH?

05:58.399 --> 05:59.739
YEAH, WHEN SHE'S ASLEEP.

05:59.740 --> 06:01.740
I LIKED HER BETTER
THE FIRST NINE MONTHS

06:01.742 --> 06:03.032
WHEN SHE COULDN'T TALK.

06:03.033 --> 06:05.123
DID YOU SEE HER
SHOVE ME OUT OF THE WAY

06:05.115 --> 06:07.035
JUST SO SHE COULD
GET TO YOU FIRST?

06:07.037 --> 06:09.447
YEAH. IF YOU WOULD HAVE
BOXED HER OUT...

06:09.450 --> 06:11.410
YOU GOT TO LEARN
HOW TO POST UP.

06:11.412 --> 06:14.552
I CAN'T TALK TO HER
LATELY, MICHAEL.

06:14.545 --> 06:17.045
IT'S LIKE I'M
CHARLIE BROWN'S TEACHER.

06:17.047 --> 06:20.257
WAH-WAH-WAH-WAH-WAH.

06:20.260 --> 06:21.800
AND I KNOW
SHE HEARS ME TALKING.

06:21.802 --> 06:23.762
JUST THE WORDS AREN'T
GETTING THROUGH, MICHAEL.

06:23.764 --> 06:25.974
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TRY
A MORE INDIRECT APPROACH?

06:25.966 --> 06:28.676
DO SOMETHING FUN WITH HER,
TAKE HER SHOPPING, YOU KNOW.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.849
AND THEN IF YOU GOT SOMETHING
TO TALK ABOUT,

06:30.851 --> 06:31.931
JUST CASUALLY BRING IT UP.

06:31.932 --> 06:34.482
YOU KNOW, THAT'S ACTUALLY
NOT A BAD IDEA.

06:34.475 --> 06:38.475
UH, HELLO.
I'M ONLY HER DAD.

06:38.479 --> 06:40.519
MAYBE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

06:40.521 --> 06:43.571
DO YOU KNOW THAT JUNIOR
HAS BEEN LOCKED UP IN HIS ROOM

06:43.574 --> 06:46.334
WITH HIS TEXTBOOK SINCE
HE CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL?

06:46.326 --> 06:47.826
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?

06:47.828 --> 06:48.908
HONEY, I CAN'T GIVE AWAY

06:48.909 --> 06:50.369
MY SECRET
MOTIVATIONAL TECHNIQUES.

06:50.370 --> 06:52.660
COME ON, MICHAEL,
STOP PLAYING.

06:52.663 --> 06:55.593
I'M LIKE THE BLACK
TONY ROBBINS.
PLEASE.

06:55.586 --> 06:57.496
I'M TONY! TONI! TONé! ROBBINS.

06:57.498 --> 07:01.298
DADDY, I WANT
A $1,000 DEAL, TOO.

07:01.301 --> 07:04.851
BABY, WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT WAS THAT?

07:04.845 --> 07:08.215
DADDY'S GIVING JUNIOR $1,000
IF HE GETS AN "A."

07:13.764 --> 07:16.774
SECRET MOTIVATIONAL
TECHNIQUES?

07:16.767 --> 07:18.817
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
IF IT WORKS?

07:18.819 --> 07:20.729
THE BIG DEAL --

07:25.235 --> 07:27.735
THE BIG DEAL, MICHAEL,
IS IT'S JUST WRONG.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.028
HE SHOULD WANT TO DO WELL

07:29.029 --> 07:30.829
WITHOUT MONEY
AS AN INCENTIVE.

07:30.831 --> 07:32.871
WHY?
BECAUSE I WANT HIM
TO LEARN MATH

07:32.873 --> 07:34.373
FOR THE LOVE OF LEARNING.

07:34.374 --> 07:35.964
WHY?
SO HE COULD GET
A GOOD JOB.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.836
AND WHY?
SO HE CAN MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY.

07:37.838 --> 07:40.038
I REST MY CASE.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.380
DON'T TWIST THIS.

07:41.381 --> 07:44.081
BRIBING HIM IS NOT THE WAY
TO GET HIM TO ACHIEVE.

07:44.084 --> 07:46.014
LOOK, BABY,
HERE'S HOW I SEE IT.

07:46.006 --> 07:47.846
YOU PAY HIM
THE FIRST TIME,

07:47.848 --> 07:49.928
AND THEN ONCE HE REALIZES
HE CAN DO IT,

07:49.930 --> 07:52.800
HE'S SET HIS OWN STANDARDS.
NOW HE HAS NO EXCUSES.

07:52.803 --> 07:56.983
WELL, I DON'T LIKE IT,
AND I'M TOTALLY AGAINST IT.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.647
DID I TELL YOU
HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU LOOK TODAY?

07:59.650 --> 08:01.770
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

08:01.772 --> 08:04.362
WHEN YOU PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN
LIKE THAT, OH, MY GOD.

08:04.364 --> 08:06.284
REALLY?
STOP IT.

08:06.276 --> 08:08.656
OH, OUCH!

08:10.200 --> 08:12.490
OUCH!

08:12.492 --> 08:16.622
YOU LIKE IT
WHEN I DO LIKE THIS?
MMM. IT IS SO SEXY.

08:16.617 --> 08:19.417
OH, BABY.
FIX THIS THING WITH JUNIOR,

08:19.419 --> 08:21.709
AND YOU MIGHT
SEE IT AGAIN.

08:28.799 --> 08:32.429
HEY. I'M NOT INTERRUPTING
YOUR STUDIES, AM I?

08:32.432 --> 08:34.432
NO.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

08:34.433 --> 08:36.524
DAD, I FEEL LIKE
THE STUPIDEST PERSON

08:36.515 --> 08:37.846
ON THE PLANET.

08:37.847 --> 08:39.938
IT'S LIKE THE INFORMATION
GETS TO MY BRAIN,

08:39.940 --> 08:41.270
THEN IT JUST STOPS.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.900
I MEAN, I CAN'T GET IT
PAST MY EYES.

08:42.903 --> 08:45.863
AND I HATE DISAPPOINTING
YOU AND MOM,

08:45.856 --> 08:47.946
BUT ALGEBRA'S
A MYSTERY TO ME.

08:47.948 --> 08:50.858
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, SON,
I DIDN'T GET IT, EITHER.

08:50.861 --> 08:52.071
I WAS NEVER GOOD AT MATH.

08:52.072 --> 08:53.912
SO WHAT AM I
GOING TO DO?

08:53.914 --> 08:55.834
I'VE GOT FINALS COMING UP.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.576
WELL, I'D LIKE TO TAKE
ONE MORE STAB

08:57.578 --> 09:00.078
AT TRYING TO UNLOCK THAT
ALGEBRA DOOR INSIDE YOUR HEAD.

09:00.080 --> 09:04.000
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY LIVES
BEHIND THE ALGEBRA DOOR.

09:04.004 --> 09:05.054
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT,

09:05.045 --> 09:07.335
BUT IF MONEY
DOESN'T MOTIVATE YOU,

09:07.337 --> 09:10.007
THERE'S ONLY ONE
OTHER THING THAT MIGHT.

09:11.471 --> 09:16.311
HI, I'M DANIELLE, THE TUTOR.
YOU MUST BE JUNIOR.

09:27.988 --> 09:30.148
OH, HI, DANIELLE.
HI, MICHAEL.

09:30.150 --> 09:32.190
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THIS IS MY WIFE JAY.

09:32.192 --> 09:33.242
THAT'S DANIELLE.

09:33.243 --> 09:35.753
HI, PLEASED TO MEET YOU.
SO, UH, MICHAEL,

09:35.746 --> 09:37.746
WHERE DO YOU KNOW
DANIELLE FROM?

09:37.748 --> 09:40.538
REMEMBER MY OLD MATH TEACHER
MISS JACKSON?

09:40.540 --> 09:42.120
THIS IS HER DAUGHTER.

09:42.122 --> 09:44.542
OH!

09:44.544 --> 09:46.804
MY MOTHER STILL COUNTS YOU
AS HER BIGGEST FAILURE.

09:46.797 --> 09:48.467
SHE TRIED
BEATING MATH INTO ME,

09:48.468 --> 09:50.298
AND EVEN THOUGH
I NEVER LEARNED IT,

09:50.300 --> 09:53.050
SHE NEVER GAVE UP, AND SHE
ALWAYS GAVE ME MY PRIDE.

09:53.053 --> 09:57.433
WELL, I PLAN
TO GIVE IT TO LITTLE JUNIOR.
UNH.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.140
SO, UM,
WHERE SHOULD WE DO IT?

10:03.143 --> 10:05.493
HUH?

10:05.485 --> 10:07.315
THE TUTORING.
WHERE CAN WE WORK?

10:07.317 --> 10:09.187
HOW ABOUT MY ROOM?

10:09.189 --> 10:11.569
HOW ABOUT NOT?

10:11.571 --> 10:13.731
THE KITCHEN MIGHT BE
BETTER SUITED.

10:13.734 --> 10:15.584
DANIELLE, CAN I
GET YOU ANYTHING?

10:15.575 --> 10:17.825
OH, NO, THANKS.
I'M FINE.

10:17.828 --> 10:19.328
OH, YES, YOU ARE.

10:20.741 --> 10:23.201
LET'S GET TO WORK.

10:23.203 --> 10:24.673
Michael: HEY.

10:24.665 --> 10:26.245
STUDY HARD, SON.

10:26.246 --> 10:29.336
WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

10:31.591 --> 10:34.381
OW!
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

10:34.384 --> 10:39.314
OUR SON NEEDS HELP IN ALGEBRA,
NOT WONDERBRA.

10:39.309 --> 10:41.349
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
A LITTLE EXTRA MOTIVATION?

10:41.351 --> 10:42.641
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME

10:42.642 --> 10:44.732
THAT THE BETTER-LOOKING
YOUR TEACHER IS,

10:44.725 --> 10:45.765
THE HARDER YOU WORK?

10:45.766 --> 10:49.766
HELL, YES.

10:49.770 --> 10:52.360
I NEVER FORGOT SPANISH.
YOU KNOW WHY?

10:52.362 --> 10:53.692
WHY?

10:53.694 --> 10:59.084
SU BUSTO ENORME ME
ENCANTABA.

10:59.079 --> 11:00.989
WHAT DID THAT MEAN?

11:00.991 --> 11:05.751
I WAS ENCHANTED BY
HER ENORMOUS BREASTS.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.049
HEY, JUNIOR, STOP PLAYING
WITH YOUR FOOD.

11:11.051 --> 11:12.671
I'M NOT PLAYING.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.182
I'M GOING OVER
MY ALGEBRA FORMULAS.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.135
REALLY?
LET'S CHECK THE PROGRESS.

11:18.138 --> 11:19.258
LET'S SEE.

11:19.259 --> 11:22.599
IF MINUS 5 TIMES 7
PLUS "R" MINUS 4

11:22.602 --> 11:27.152
EQUALS NEGATIVE 30,
WHAT DOES "R" EQUAL?

11:27.147 --> 11:28.687
9.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.808
HMM.

11:29.810 --> 11:32.190
IS THAT RIGHT?

11:32.192 --> 11:34.612
YEAH.

11:34.614 --> 11:35.954
I'VE GOT TO GO.

11:35.946 --> 11:38.156
AREN'T YOU GOING TO BE
A LITTLE EARLY FOR SCHOOL?

11:38.158 --> 11:39.408
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE

11:39.409 --> 11:41.119
TO GET THERE TILL
THE VERY LAST MINUTE.

11:41.121 --> 11:42.491
WELL, I GOT TO STOP
AND PICK UP

11:42.492 --> 11:44.202
A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR DANIELLE.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.504
YOU KNOW,
FOR HELPING ME OUT.

11:47.087 --> 11:49.877
ISN'T THIS GREAT?
HE'S LEARNING ALGEBRA.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.420
HE'S FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH THAT WOMAN, MICHAEL.

11:52.422 --> 11:54.252
NO, IT'S JUST
A LITTLE CRUSH.

11:54.254 --> 11:57.304
DO YOU THINK
HE KNOWS THAT, MICHAEL?

11:57.297 --> 11:58.217
IF IT HELPS HIM
WITH THE ALGEBRA,

11:58.218 --> 11:59.508
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

11:59.509 --> 12:01.179
OH, SO THAT'S ALL
THAT MATTERS --

12:01.181 --> 12:03.761
MY SON PASSING ALGEBRA.
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF MY SON

12:03.764 --> 12:05.614
GETS HIS HEART BROKEN
ALONG THE WAY.

12:05.605 --> 12:08.345
LOOK, YOU SAID YOU WANTED HIM
TO DO WELL IN MATH.

12:08.348 --> 12:10.348
HE'S DOING WELL IN MATH.
THERE'S A TRADEOFF.

12:10.350 --> 12:12.850
THE GOOD NEWS IS HE'S GOING
TO PASS HIS ALGEBRA FINAL.

12:12.853 --> 12:14.613
YEAH, BUT FOR ALL
THE WRONG REASONS.

12:14.614 --> 12:15.784
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.316
SOME OF THE GREATEST
SUCCESS STORIES

12:17.317 --> 12:19.197
IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
HAS BEEN BECAUSE SOME GUY

12:19.199 --> 12:20.569
WAS TRYING TO IMPRESS
A WOMAN.

12:20.570 --> 12:22.450
IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH.

12:22.452 --> 12:23.952
LOOK AT HENRY FORD.

12:23.954 --> 12:27.584
HE INVENTED THE AUTOMOBILE
SO HE COULD PICK UP CHICKS.

12:27.577 --> 12:31.327
EVERYBODY ELSE IS RIDING AROUND
ON A STINKING HORSE,

12:31.331 --> 12:34.541
HE PULLS UP IN A BRAND-NEW
SHINY AUTOMOBILE, HE SAYS,

12:34.544 --> 12:36.144
"HEY, BABY,
YOU WANT TO RIDE?

12:36.136 --> 12:37.876
"I'LL GET YOU THERE
IN HALF THE TIME.

12:37.878 --> 12:40.178
YOU WON'T HAVE TO SMELL
HORSE BUTT ALL THE WAY."

12:40.180 --> 12:41.590
HA HA HA.

12:47.227 --> 12:48.807
THIS IS FUN, ISN'T IT?

12:48.809 --> 12:51.599
ACTUALLY, IT IS.

12:51.601 --> 12:53.691
I WISH I WOULD HAVE DONE
THIS KIND OF STUFF

12:53.693 --> 12:54.733
WITH MY MOTHER.

12:54.734 --> 12:56.364
WHY DIDN'T YOU?

12:56.356 --> 12:58.396
WELL, BECAUSE
I WAS TOO BUSY

12:58.398 --> 13:00.898
BEING HOSTILE AND ANGRY
TOWARDS HER

13:00.901 --> 13:02.451
AND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHY.

13:02.452 --> 13:04.872
ALL I KNEW WAS
EVERYTHING SHE SAID

13:04.865 --> 13:07.245
AND EVERYTHING SHE DID
WAS WRONG.

13:07.247 --> 13:09.747
WELL, THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

13:09.749 --> 13:12.039
SEE, BUT THE WAY
SHE HANDLED IT

13:12.042 --> 13:13.252
WAS TO WHUP MY BUTT,

13:13.253 --> 13:15.843
WHICH I PROBABLY WOULDN'T
DO TO YOU

13:15.836 --> 13:18.046
'CAUSE OF ALL
THESE WITNESSES.

13:20.340 --> 13:24.630
LOOK, HERE'S THE THING.

13:24.634 --> 13:27.604
I BARELY SPOKE TO MY MOTHER
FOR SEVEN YEARS.

13:27.597 --> 13:29.977
NOW, I'M NOT SAYING
THAT WE NEED

13:29.980 --> 13:32.310
TO BE ALL LOVEY-DOVEY
AND ALL THAT,

13:32.312 --> 13:35.402
BUT I WANT US TO BE CIVIL
TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER.

13:35.395 --> 13:38.195
LOOK AT ME, CLAIRE.

13:40.490 --> 13:43.110
I DON'T LIKE
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.503
BUT, MOM, I HAVEN'T BEEN
DOING IT ON PURPOSE.

13:45.495 --> 13:47.865
IT'S JUST,
IT'S A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON

13:47.868 --> 13:50.248
THAT I DON'T THINK
YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND.

13:50.250 --> 13:53.250
CLAIRE...TRY ME.

13:53.253 --> 13:54.793
EVERYTHING'S CHANGING, MOM.

13:54.794 --> 13:56.264
I MEAN, SOME OF MY FRIENDS

13:56.256 --> 13:58.506
STILL ACT LIKE
THEY'RE LITTLE KIDS

13:58.508 --> 14:01.298
AND SOME OF THEM ARE
PRETENDING TO BE GROWNUPS,

14:01.301 --> 14:03.461
AND I'M JUST
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.

14:03.463 --> 14:05.313
CLAIRE, I'VE BEEN
WHERE YOU ARE

14:05.305 --> 14:06.845
AND I KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.846
LOOK, PRETTY SOON YOU

14:08.848 --> 14:11.518
AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE
GOING TO BE PRETENDING

14:11.521 --> 14:13.061
TO BE GROWN UP,

14:13.063 --> 14:15.073
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
THAT WON'T CHANGE --

14:15.065 --> 14:16.815
I'LL ALWAYS BE
ON YOUR SIDE.

14:16.816 --> 14:18.316
BUT, MOM,
YOU'RE THE PERSON

14:18.318 --> 14:20.278
THAT'S ALWAYS SAYING NO
TO ME.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.440
THAT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT
YOUR FRIEND, CLAIRE,

14:22.442 --> 14:23.982
I'M YOUR MOTHER.

14:23.984 --> 14:26.624
WELL, IS THERE ANYTHING WE'RE
EVER GOING TO AGREE ON?

14:31.331 --> 14:32.621
OH, HI, HONEY.

14:32.622 --> 14:33.662
HEY, DADDY.

14:33.663 --> 14:36.423
HILARIOUS.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:36.416 --> 14:38.706
I SAY WE DO THIS
EVERY WEEK.

14:38.708 --> 14:41.258
COOL. NEXT WEEK,
LET'S TRY PINK.

14:41.261 --> 14:42.631
PINK?
YES, PINK.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.222
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT PINK.
ORANGE.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.306
TWO TRAINS LEAVE CHICAGO
AND NEW YORK

14:48.308 --> 14:49.468
MOVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER.

14:49.469 --> 14:50.929
I'M ON THE TRAIN
FROM CHICAGO

14:50.931 --> 14:52.511
AND WE'RE MOVING
AT 40 MILES AN HOUR.

14:52.512 --> 14:54.312
YOU'RE ON THE TRAIN
FROM NEW YORK.

14:54.314 --> 14:56.404
IT'S TRAVELING
AT 60 MILES AN HOUR.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.476
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN CHICAGO
AND NEW YORK IS 1,000 MILES.

14:59.479 --> 15:01.569
HOW LONG AFTER --
10 HOURS.

15:01.571 --> 15:05.491
YOU ARE GOING TO ACE
THAT FINAL EXAM TOMORROW.

15:05.485 --> 15:07.195
THANKS TO YOU.

15:07.197 --> 15:10.617
WELL, I THINK
WE'RE ALL DONE HERE.

15:10.620 --> 15:12.700
DONE? WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THE TRAINS

15:12.702 --> 15:15.212
GET TO THE STATION
AND I GET OFF MY TRAIN

15:15.205 --> 15:16.625
AND YOU GET OFF YOUR TRAIN?

15:16.626 --> 15:18.796
WHAT, WE JUST GO
OUR SEPARATE WAYS?

15:20.340 --> 15:21.920
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.051
JUNIOR, YOU KNOW AS MUCH
ABOUT ALGEBRA

15:25.045 --> 15:26.505
AS I CAN TEACH YOU.

15:26.506 --> 15:28.756
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH OTHER
STUFF TO LEARN, LIKE...

15:28.758 --> 15:31.138
[ Deep voice ] WHAT TYPE
OF GUYS DO YOU LIKE, BABY?

15:31.141 --> 15:33.471
I LIKE SMART GUYS, JUNIOR,

15:33.473 --> 15:36.443
THE KIND OF GUY
YOU'RE GOING TO BE

15:36.436 --> 15:38.436
IF YOU APPLY YOURSELF.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.858
BUT I WANT TO APPLY MYSELF
TO YOU, DANIELLE.

15:41.861 --> 15:42.861
I LOVE YOU,

15:42.862 --> 15:45.332
AND I CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT YOU.

15:45.325 --> 15:47.905
OH, JUNIOR,
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

15:47.907 --> 15:51.327
NO, NO. THAT'S THE TONE
MY GRANDMOTHER USES.

15:51.331 --> 15:52.781
SEE, ILOVEYOU.

15:52.782 --> 15:55.292
I WANT TO HAVE
YOUR BABIES.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.667
I MEAN...

15:59.669 --> 16:02.959
IT'S NOT ME
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH.

16:02.962 --> 16:07.432
IT'S LEARNING, AND THAT'S
A WONDERFUL PASSION.

16:07.427 --> 16:08.797
DON'T LOSE IT.

16:08.798 --> 16:12.088
OH, I FEEL PASSION EVERY TIME
I THINK ABOUT YOU.

16:12.092 --> 16:14.142
WALK ME TO THE DOOR.

16:19.439 --> 16:21.649
I CAN'T.

16:27.197 --> 16:29.407
YOU ARE A VERY SWEET

16:29.409 --> 16:33.529
AND VERY SMART BOY,
JUNIOR.

16:33.533 --> 16:34.783
GOOD LUCK.

16:36.376 --> 16:39.416
OKAY, CLASS,
YOU'LL HAVE ONE HOUR

16:39.419 --> 16:41.169
TO COMPLETE THIS EXAM.

16:41.171 --> 16:44.171
SOME OF YOU WILL GET
THE OPPORTUNITY

16:44.174 --> 16:47.554
TO TAKE A SECOND STAB AT IT
THIS SUMMER.

16:50.550 --> 16:52.220
YOU MAY BEGIN NOW.

17:38.228 --> 17:40.058
OH, MAN,
DON'T TELL ME.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.679
YOU FAILED YOUR TEST.

17:41.681 --> 17:42.891
NO, I ACED IT.

17:42.892 --> 17:45.192
GET OUT OF HERE.
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

17:45.185 --> 17:47.735
SON, I KNEW
YOU COULD DO IT.

17:47.737 --> 17:48.857
THANKS, DAD.

17:48.858 --> 17:50.818
SEE, I TOLD YOU
HIS HEART

17:50.820 --> 17:52.610
WAS GOING
TO BE BROKEN.

17:52.612 --> 17:54.532
YEAH, AND I TOLD YOU
HE'D LEARN ALGEBRA.

17:54.534 --> 17:56.294
I HATE SEEING HIM
LIKE THIS, MICHAEL.

17:56.286 --> 17:58.456
YEAH, WELL, I HATE
SEEING HIM LIKE THIS, TOO,

17:58.458 --> 18:00.248
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
LIFE IS TOUGH.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.120
AND IF HE LEARNED SOMETHING
ABOUT HIMSELF

18:02.122 --> 18:03.292
AND IT TOOK
A LITTLE HURT TO GET THERE,

18:03.293 --> 18:04.583
THEN SO BE IT.

18:04.584 --> 18:08.094
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO PULL OFF
ALL THIS TOUGH LOVE STUFF,

18:08.087 --> 18:09.507
BUT I'M HIS MOTHER

18:09.509 --> 18:12.009
AND I HATE TO SEE
MY BOY IN PAIN.

18:14.304 --> 18:17.224
ALL RIGHT.

18:57.467 --> 18:59.137
NOT TO ME, THERE AREN'T.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.348
LOOK, I'M SORRY
YOU'RE HURTING.

19:01.351 --> 19:04.181
DAD, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

19:04.184 --> 19:05.274
YES, I DO.

19:05.265 --> 19:07.475
I KIND OF FIGURED
THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

19:07.477 --> 19:10.267
THEN WHY DID YOU
INTRODUCE ME TO HER?

19:10.270 --> 19:13.070
WHAT, YOU COULDN'T FIND
SOME OLD FAT LADY

19:13.072 --> 19:15.372
WITH A MUSTACHE
AND BODY ODOR?

19:15.365 --> 19:19.775
YEAH, BUT YOUR MOTHER'S
SISTER WAS UNAVAILABLE.

HAVE LEARNED ALGEBRA,

19:26.376 --> 19:29.496
AND YOU SURE WOULDN'T HAVE
LEARNED HOW TO BE A MAN.

19:29.499 --> 19:31.379
I HAVEN'T LEARNED
HOW TO BE A MAN.

19:31.381 --> 19:32.791
YES, YOU DID.

19:32.792 --> 19:35.392
SEE, A MAN HAS TO LEARN
TO CONTROL HIS EMOTIONS

BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER

19:36.926 --> 19:39.636
HE'S GOING TO FALL
