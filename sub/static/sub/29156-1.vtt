01:26.605 --> 01:28.021
Good morning, Maggie.

01:28.022 --> 01:29.229
Hi, Sasha.

01:29.230 --> 01:31.354
Those look great.

01:31.355 --> 01:33.020
Thanks. I'm just trying
to stay on top

01:33.021 --> 01:34.312
of all these weddings
we have coming through.

01:34.313 --> 01:36.396
And we have another one
arriving this afternoon.

01:36.397 --> 01:37.397
Right.

01:37.398 --> 01:38.729
It's gotten difficult
to remember

01:38.730 --> 01:41.104
whose wedding I'm shooting.

01:41.105 --> 01:42.520
Well, luckily,
I'm great at my job.

01:42.521 --> 01:43.562
You just need to show up

01:43.563 --> 01:44.603
and take
your beautiful photographs.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.604
Deal.

01:47.813 --> 01:49.729
You know I could
help you with this mess.

01:49.730 --> 01:50.812
I am a wedding planner,

01:50.813 --> 01:53.228
I do organize for a living.

01:53.229 --> 01:54.936
Evelyn bingewatched
all these videos

01:54.937 --> 01:56.353
of the joys of organizing,

01:56.354 --> 01:58.395
so now she wants me

01:58.396 --> 02:00.769
to go through all the old boxes
she has in storage.

02:00.770 --> 02:03.103
Your guitar.

02:03.104 --> 02:04.894
Yeah.
She's really cleaning house.

02:04.895 --> 02:05.936
Does this mean we're finally

02:05.937 --> 02:08.269
going to get
a Maggie Case concert?

02:08.270 --> 02:10.394
It's not really
something I do anymore.

02:10.395 --> 02:12.935
Well, that's a shame.

02:12.936 --> 02:14.477
When was the last time
you played?

02:14.478 --> 02:15.437
Not since I left Nashville.

02:15.438 --> 02:16.811
You must miss it.

02:18.728 --> 02:19.728
Let's go.

02:34.310 --> 02:35.435
I...

02:35.436 --> 02:37.642
I got a call from MVR Events
in Seattle,

02:37.643 --> 02:39.101
and they want to know

02:39.102 --> 02:41.582
if I'm interested in heading up
their corporate event division.

02:41.977 --> 02:43.809
That's huge!

02:43.810 --> 02:45.267
Yeah.

02:45.268 --> 02:47.517
Congratulations?

02:47.518 --> 02:48.767
I guess.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.350
I mean, I've always wanted
to be in charge,

02:50.351 --> 02:52.892
I just always thought
it would be here.

02:54.143 --> 02:56.808
Have you told Evelyn that plan?

02:56.809 --> 02:57.850
Every time I try to bring it up,

02:57.851 --> 03:00.266
she changes the subject.

03:00.267 --> 03:01.933
I mean, don't get me wrong.

03:01.934 --> 03:04.016
The last three years
being her assistant

03:04.017 --> 03:05.683
have been great,

03:05.684 --> 03:08.141
but being an assistant
isn't my passion,

03:08.142 --> 03:09.683
and that's too long

03:09.684 --> 03:12.182
to be doing something
that isn't your true passion.

03:12.183 --> 03:14.849
Yeah. That's...

03:14.850 --> 03:16.267
that's important.

03:30.474 --> 03:31.474
Alright.

03:31.475 --> 03:33.140
We are ready to record this.

03:33.141 --> 03:34.306
Now, you can hear

03:34.307 --> 03:36.014
Ashleigh likes to play
with the rhythms on this,

03:36.015 --> 03:37.889
and I really want to match that.

03:37.890 --> 03:39.348
Like this, okay?

03:44.348 --> 03:45.681
You sound good, Jake.

03:45.682 --> 03:48.640
Hey, everyone.
It's Ashleigh.

03:49.848 --> 03:50.972
I just wanted to poke my head in

03:50.973 --> 03:52.347
to see how it's going.

03:52.348 --> 03:53.472
It's going great,

03:53.473 --> 03:55.139
and as soon as
we lock these harmonies down,

03:55.140 --> 03:56.347
we'll be ready to mix.

03:56.348 --> 03:58.805
Good, because the album
has to drop on the 27th

03:58.806 --> 04:00.221
or it messes up the tour
and everything.

04:00.222 --> 04:01.930
It'll be ready.

04:01.931 --> 04:03.304
Trust me.

04:03.305 --> 04:05.013
I love your energy.

04:06.514 --> 04:09.514
You know, my manager
thought I was crazy to hire you.

04:10.514 --> 04:12.805
But I think
you're gonna prove him wrong.

04:13.972 --> 04:15.179
I'm glad I took a chance on you.

04:15.180 --> 04:17.721
Yeah, well, I'm...
I'm glad you did, too.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.345
Okay, yeah, let's...

04:21.346 --> 04:22.470
Let's make it a good one, yeah?

04:22.471 --> 04:24.928
Stand by for playback.

04:24.929 --> 04:26.430
Go ahead.

04:33.221 --> 04:34.386
Jenn, I checked.

04:34.387 --> 04:36.054
The flight is on time.

04:38.262 --> 04:39.511
I know
it's the only ferry today,

04:39.512 --> 04:41.472
but I have plenty of time
to catch it when I land.

04:44.095 --> 04:45.844
I promise I won't miss it.

04:45.845 --> 04:47.512
I love you, too.

04:49.262 --> 04:50.969
Bride having
some pre-wedding jitters?

04:50.970 --> 04:52.177
She's just worried

04:52.178 --> 04:53.468
I'm going to miss the ferry
to Piedmount Island.

04:53.469 --> 04:55.885
Apparently, it runs
on some crazy schedule,

04:55.886 --> 04:57.136
Hey, good work today.

04:57.137 --> 04:59.052
Give me those mixes,
I'll send you back my notes.

04:59.053 --> 05:01.386
- Will do.
- See ya.

05:20.844 --> 05:21.844
Everything okay, Nana?

05:21.845 --> 05:23.426
Fine...

05:23.427 --> 05:26.842
And what did I tell you about
calling me "Nana" at work?

05:26.843 --> 05:29.426
Right. At work, you're Evelyn.

05:29.427 --> 05:30.301
Thank you.

05:30.302 --> 05:31.925
I do not look nearly old enough

05:31.926 --> 05:33.508
to have a granddaughter
your age.

05:33.509 --> 05:35.717
You're practically my sister.

05:35.718 --> 05:37.842
You are not so funny.

05:37.843 --> 05:39.008
And aren't you supposed to be
over at Tricia's

05:39.009 --> 05:40.008
doing a shoot for the brochure?

05:40.009 --> 05:42.174
I'm on my way there now.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.924
You need to finish it
and get to the ferry on time

05:43.925 --> 05:45.508
to photograph it coming in.

05:45.509 --> 05:46.675
I've got plenty of time.

05:48.300 --> 05:50.590
Sasha, why don't you give her
a lift over to Tricia's

05:50.591 --> 05:51.632
so she's not late?

05:51.633 --> 05:53.007
I thought we were going

05:53.008 --> 05:54.507
to narrow down
room layout options

05:54.508 --> 05:55.549
for the Blake wedding
next month?

05:55.550 --> 05:57.341
Already took care of it.

05:59.049 --> 06:00.341
Okay.

06:02.007 --> 06:03.049
I guess I'm your ride.

06:04.133 --> 06:05.133
Bye, Nana.

06:26.798 --> 06:27.798
Okay...

06:27.799 --> 06:30.714
Is it the flowers?

06:30.715 --> 06:32.089
Is it me?

06:32.090 --> 06:33.296
Am I not photogenic?

06:33.297 --> 06:34.839
You're absolutely photogenic.

06:34.840 --> 06:35.840
I'm just...

06:38.005 --> 06:39.005
I have an idea.

06:42.922 --> 06:43.880
Trust me.

06:43.881 --> 06:45.754
This isn't selling any flowers.

06:45.755 --> 06:47.714
I want you to create
the arrangement.

06:48.922 --> 06:49.922
I just did.

06:49.923 --> 06:51.630
No... Like, actually do it.

06:52.755 --> 06:54.170
Just get into your flow.

06:54.171 --> 06:55.797
Don't even think about me
or the camera.

06:57.046 --> 06:58.213
Alright.

07:00.171 --> 07:01.463
- Okay.
- Yeah.

07:07.171 --> 07:09.920
Good.
That's beautiful.

07:09.921 --> 07:10.921
Perfect.

07:14.088 --> 07:15.254
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:19.962 --> 07:21.586
It looks great, Tricia.

07:21.587 --> 07:23.129
See? Photogenic.

07:24.878 --> 07:27.169
So, when do I get to do
flowers for your wedding?

07:27.170 --> 07:28.377
My wedding?

07:28.378 --> 07:30.419
You need a fiancÃ©
before you can get married.

07:30.420 --> 07:33.460
Well, you know, my son, Oscar,
is still single.

07:33.461 --> 07:35.711
And just a ferry ride away.

07:35.712 --> 07:37.001
Good to know.

07:37.002 --> 07:39.752
Speaking of which,
we need to get to the dock.

07:39.753 --> 07:40.960
Right.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.668
We'll have a mock-up
of your brochure in a few days.

07:43.669 --> 07:44.710
Bye.

07:44.711 --> 07:46.378
Thanks.

07:58.502 --> 08:00.042
This is so beautiful.
I'm so excited.

08:00.043 --> 08:02.334
Jenn, this is something special.

08:02.335 --> 08:03.750
Isn't it?

08:03.751 --> 08:05.750
Also, isn't this
the cutest little ferry boat

08:05.751 --> 08:06.792
you've ever seen?

08:06.793 --> 08:08.667
Yeah. How did you find this?

08:08.668 --> 08:09.668
I have my ways.

08:13.001 --> 08:14.334
So pretty.

08:24.167 --> 08:26.084
Colby and Robertson wedding.

08:28.167 --> 08:29.875
I'm going to go
check everyone in.

08:32.917 --> 08:34.457
It can't be.

08:51.666 --> 08:53.665
Hi, everyone.

08:53.666 --> 08:56.540
Hi. Welcome to Piedmount Island,

08:56.541 --> 09:00.541
where one week of tradition
brings you a lifetime of love.

09:01.540 --> 09:02.664
I'm Sasha,

09:02.665 --> 09:04.539
and I'm here to check in
all the arriving guests

09:04.540 --> 09:06.330
for the Colby and Robertson
wedding.

09:06.331 --> 09:07.664
Hi. Jake Colby.

09:07.665 --> 09:10.039
Hi, Jake.
Welcome to Piedmount Island.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.247
If you can just
step over to my right,

09:11.248 --> 09:13.330
Maggie will be taking
your arrival photo.

09:13.331 --> 09:14.831
Okay.

09:17.997 --> 09:19.039
Hi, Jake.

09:21.831 --> 09:23.830
Maggie?

09:23.831 --> 09:25.788
Maggie...

09:25.789 --> 09:27.039
Hi. What are you...

09:28.205 --> 09:29.329
Hi.

09:29.330 --> 09:30.664
So who's the lucky lady?

09:32.706 --> 09:34.037
The lucky lady? I...

09:34.038 --> 09:35.746
Yeah... I mean...

09:37.080 --> 09:38.830
Jennifer... My sister.
You know, my sister?

09:41.496 --> 09:42.745
I th...

09:42.746 --> 09:44.246
- Yeah.
- Right.

09:44.247 --> 09:45.704
Did Jennifer invite you
to the wedding?

09:45.705 --> 09:48.412
No. Not...
Not exactly.

09:48.413 --> 09:51.413
It looks like
I'm the wedding photographer.

09:54.204 --> 09:55.703
I thought you moved home.

09:55.704 --> 09:57.036
Yeah, I did,

09:57.037 --> 09:58.161
but my...

09:58.162 --> 09:59.162
my grandma runs

09:59.163 --> 10:00.661
the reception manor
on the island,

10:00.662 --> 10:02.994
so I took a job doing photos.

10:02.995 --> 10:05.161
Well, that's...
that's great.

10:05.162 --> 10:07.119
I mean you've always loved that.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.327
You know, you took the photo
of the Shelby Street Bridge

10:09.328 --> 10:10.370
for our album cover?

10:11.286 --> 10:12.245
The one you hated.

10:12.246 --> 10:13.785
I didn't hate it.

10:13.786 --> 10:15.785
Even though the walkway
wasn't "Exactly Center"?

10:15.786 --> 10:18.327
I've...

10:18.328 --> 10:20.703
come to learn that's part of
the composition's charm.

10:22.911 --> 10:24.452
- Jenn. Hi!
- Hi!

10:27.036 --> 10:28.743
It is so good to see you.

10:28.744 --> 10:30.284
You too.

10:30.285 --> 10:31.992
So you're getting married, huh?

10:31.993 --> 10:34.909
Yeah, well, I figured.
I like him, so why not.

10:34.910 --> 10:36.326
- Kyle.
- Hi.

10:36.327 --> 10:37.451
Congratulations.

10:37.452 --> 10:38.575
Thank you so much.

10:38.576 --> 10:39.867
Maggie this is Lindsay,

10:39.868 --> 10:41.742
my favorite cousin,
slash maid of honor.

10:41.743 --> 10:42.743
Hi.

10:42.744 --> 10:44.784
And this is Derek,
Kyle's best man.

10:44.785 --> 10:46.785
- Like the little brother I never had.
- Cut it out.

10:49.159 --> 10:51.158
It really is so good to see you.

10:51.159 --> 10:53.243
Thank you.
You too.

10:54.243 --> 10:55.409
You know,

10:55.410 --> 10:56.410
I mean...

10:56.411 --> 10:57.616
I have to ask.

10:57.617 --> 11:00.117
What's with
all the super-secret...

11:00.118 --> 11:02.950
I know. I know.
I'm sorry.

11:02.951 --> 11:03.991
I just...

11:03.992 --> 11:05.408
I really wanted you
to be at my wedding,

11:05.409 --> 11:06.574
but I was scared
you wouldn't come.

11:06.575 --> 11:08.700
Jenn, you could have
just called and asked.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.408
I didn't want
to put that pressure on you.

11:10.409 --> 11:12.617
Yeah, this is
much less pressure.

11:14.117 --> 11:15.990
Everyone,
I think our ride is here,

11:15.991 --> 11:18.782
if you'll all just
want to follow me.

11:18.783 --> 11:20.200
That would be great.

11:22.658 --> 11:24.075
Oh, look.

11:34.032 --> 11:36.031
Kyle, look at this.

11:36.032 --> 11:37.240
This is very cool.

11:37.241 --> 11:38.989
This is the bride and groom.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.280
Hey. Nice to meet you.

11:40.281 --> 11:42.121
Alright, let's get you
on the way to the manor.

11:42.657 --> 11:44.197
It's so pretty.

11:44.198 --> 11:46.864
Mayor McCready,
they're all yours.

11:46.865 --> 11:47.865
Thank you, Sasha.

11:49.532 --> 11:50.532
Al right...

11:53.823 --> 11:55.530
Welcome everyone.

11:55.531 --> 11:57.364
As Sasha said,
I am Mayor McCready,

11:57.365 --> 11:58.947
but today, I'm just
your humble tour guide,

11:58.948 --> 12:00.488
so sit back and relax

12:00.489 --> 12:02.822
as we take the scenic route
though Piedmount Island,

12:02.823 --> 12:05.656
our little hamlet
of the Pacific.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.821
Fun fact number 1:

12:08.822 --> 12:11.697
Piedmount Island
actually qualifies as a hamlet.

12:13.905 --> 12:16.280
So... what was that all about?

12:17.655 --> 12:18.862
Yeah. I...

12:18.863 --> 12:22.821
guess I didn't tell you
the whole Nashville story.

12:22.822 --> 12:24.362
Obviously.

12:24.363 --> 12:28.153
Jake and I
were actually a singing duo.

12:28.154 --> 12:30.404
Colby & Case.

12:30.405 --> 12:31.820
What?

12:31.821 --> 12:33.570
I can't believe
you never mentioned that.

12:34.612 --> 12:36.320
I didn't want the paparazzi
to find out.

12:36.321 --> 12:37.569
It would be mayhem.

12:37.570 --> 12:40.487
I don't think they'd find you
all the way out here.

12:47.570 --> 12:49.111
Fun fact number 4...

12:49.112 --> 12:51.944
In 1968, the island was given
protected status,

12:51.945 --> 12:55.736
ensuring that it would stay
pristine for years to come.

12:56.820 --> 12:58.694
Why didn't you tell me
Maggie was going to be here?

12:58.695 --> 13:00.652
Why, so you could obsess
about it?

13:00.653 --> 13:02.402
Obsess? No, I wouldn't have...
I wouldn't have...

13:02.403 --> 13:03.569
Obsessed about it.

13:05.736 --> 13:07.111
I just would have liked
a heads up.

13:08.194 --> 13:09.834
Here's a heads up.
Maggie's gonna be here.

13:13.610 --> 13:14.651
What's the big deal?

13:14.652 --> 13:16.985
You guys must have
been friends, right?

13:18.402 --> 13:20.150
Well, we...

13:20.151 --> 13:21.943
dated for two years.

13:21.944 --> 13:23.567
What?

13:23.568 --> 13:24.777
Well, what happened?

13:25.943 --> 13:27.275
I don't know.

13:27.276 --> 13:29.734
The pressure of being a couple
and a duo was just too much.

13:32.151 --> 13:33.151
I have so many questions.

13:34.943 --> 13:36.783
And on the right
we have the Mayor's Residence.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.149
Fun fact number 11:

13:39.150 --> 13:40.316
my flower garden

13:40.317 --> 13:42.274
is the second largest
private collection

13:42.275 --> 13:43.483
of local blooms

13:43.484 --> 13:44.484
in the state of Washington.

13:44.485 --> 13:46.441
That's a lot of flowers.

13:46.442 --> 13:48.316
Fun fact number 16:

13:48.317 --> 13:50.816
the population of Piedmount
can double or triple,

13:50.817 --> 13:52.441
depending on
the size of the wedding.

13:56.483 --> 13:57.692
Thanks.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.483
I'm going to go talk to Evelyn.

14:15.649 --> 14:17.481
Did you get
some good shots of the ferry?

14:17.482 --> 14:18.606
Why didn't you tell me?

14:18.607 --> 14:21.314
Maggie, I had a client
who requested anonymity,

14:21.315 --> 14:22.731
and that's what I provided.

14:22.732 --> 14:26.022
She's not just a client, Nana.
I have...

14:26.023 --> 14:27.605
Sorry, Evelyn.

14:27.606 --> 14:29.272
I hadn't seen him in two years.

14:29.273 --> 14:31.605
It would have been nice
to know ahead of time.

14:31.606 --> 14:32.980
And what
would that have changed?

14:32.981 --> 14:34.980
I could have...

14:34.981 --> 14:36.146
I don't know... I...

14:36.147 --> 14:38.146
It would have been nice, okay,
to be prepared.

14:38.147 --> 14:40.814
Maggie, you don't have to be
nervous about seeing Jake again.

14:40.815 --> 14:42.146
I'm not nervous.

14:42.147 --> 14:43.938
What? I'm not.

14:43.939 --> 14:46.231
Just please, no more surprises.

14:47.147 --> 14:48.147
I'll do my best.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.438
Thank you.

14:49.439 --> 14:51.646
By the way, your folks say
to say hi to Jake for them.

14:51.647 --> 14:53.562
Oh, nice. Nice.

14:53.563 --> 14:55.522
So you bothered to tell them?
Great.

15:02.188 --> 15:03.229
Fun fact number...

15:03.230 --> 15:05.062
23!

15:05.063 --> 15:06.521
Thank you.

15:06.522 --> 15:07.521
Downtown Piedmount

15:07.522 --> 15:09.354
houses the most
wedding-related shops

15:09.355 --> 15:11.978
per square mile
of any place in the U.S.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.728
I want all the glasses
filled the same amount, please.

15:14.729 --> 15:15.938
Thank you.

15:17.062 --> 15:18.479
Looking great, everyone.

15:21.895 --> 15:23.396
They're here!

15:32.478 --> 15:33.644
Now, remember, next Friday,

15:33.645 --> 15:35.310
there's an open house
at the Mayor's residence,

15:35.311 --> 15:36.977
so stop on by

15:36.978 --> 15:38.143
and try one of my world-famous

15:38.144 --> 15:39.185
snickerdoodle-thumbprints'mores
cookies.

15:39.186 --> 15:40.435
Those sound delicious.

15:40.436 --> 15:42.726
Come by Friday
and see for yourself.

15:42.727 --> 15:44.144
Thank you, Mayor McCready.

15:45.269 --> 15:47.394
We're getting married
by a Mr. McCready.

15:47.395 --> 15:48.394
Any relation?

15:48.395 --> 15:49.434
Actually, yes.

15:49.435 --> 15:50.394
That's me.

15:50.395 --> 15:52.476
So you're also a minister?

15:52.477 --> 15:53.811
Is there anything you can't do?

15:54.727 --> 15:55.727
Windows.

15:58.143 --> 15:59.184
We're getting married
by the mayor.

15:59.185 --> 16:01.059
We're so fancy!

16:01.060 --> 16:02.309
Enjoy.

16:02.310 --> 16:03.976
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:19.850 --> 16:21.351
I could get used to this.

16:23.975 --> 16:24.975
Enjoy your drink.

16:36.891 --> 16:39.307
Mom and Dad
would have loved this.

16:39.308 --> 16:41.474
They'd be so proud of you.

16:41.475 --> 16:42.973
At least I've got you.

16:42.974 --> 16:44.141
The brother of the bride.

16:46.141 --> 16:47.141
You got me, right?

16:47.142 --> 16:49.057
Absolutely.

16:49.058 --> 16:50.973
Let's all raise
our glasses, everyone.

16:50.974 --> 16:53.057
To Jennifer and Kyle.

16:55.224 --> 16:56.641
To Jennifer and Kyle.

17:02.848 --> 17:04.181
Hey, I can't wait to catch up.

17:04.182 --> 17:07.763
Jenn, I'm sure Maggie has
tons of stuff she has to do.

17:07.765 --> 17:10.138
Besides, you'll be so busy
with wedding stuff.

17:10.140 --> 17:12.932
I know, but I want you
to be a part of the events.

17:14.013 --> 17:15.305
That's why
I got the deluxe package.

17:15.306 --> 17:17.556
We have a deluxe package?

17:18.556 --> 17:20.762
I created it just for Jennifer.

17:20.763 --> 17:22.762
Here's the itinerary
for the week.

17:22.763 --> 17:24.097
I do love activities.

17:24.098 --> 17:27.222
We'll start as soon as
you get settled.

17:27.223 --> 17:29.763
Maggie will meet you
on the front lawn

17:29.764 --> 17:30.764
for a photo shoot.

17:34.222 --> 17:35.554
Yay.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.638
This is going to be so much fun.

17:36.639 --> 17:37.639
Great.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.596
Here is to reconnecting
with old friends.

17:55.429 --> 17:57.011
A five-page itinerary?

17:57.012 --> 17:58.886
I thought we said
no more surprises.

17:58.887 --> 18:01.303
It's double-spaced.

18:01.304 --> 18:02.678
It's not that much.

18:02.679 --> 18:03.803
It's a lot.

18:03.804 --> 18:05.344
I mean,
some of this stuff I get.

18:05.345 --> 18:07.219
Cake tasting, nature walk.
Sure.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.636
But...

18:08.637 --> 18:10.135
Antique shopping?
Really?

18:10.136 --> 18:11.678
Just what every bride
dreams about...

18:11.679 --> 18:14.969
selfies with the groom
with a 19th-century Victrola.

18:14.970 --> 18:16.177
That's a great idea.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.761
If they do selfies,
I can stop paying you.

18:19.969 --> 18:21.135
Fine, I'm on it.

18:21.136 --> 18:22.719
That's what I thought.

18:23.969 --> 18:24.970
Have fun.

18:31.427 --> 18:33.259
That's a lot of activities.

18:33.260 --> 18:34.635
Jake, you don't need to be here.

18:34.636 --> 18:36.676
I'm just shooting
Jennifer and Kyle today.

18:36.677 --> 18:37.717
Yeah. I know.

18:37.718 --> 18:39.843
Evelyn told me
to make myself useful, so.

18:41.593 --> 18:42.759
Thanks.

18:42.760 --> 18:44.801
Apparently, when there's
a wedding on the island,

18:44.802 --> 18:45.885
everyone's involved.

18:47.176 --> 18:48.550
I...

18:48.551 --> 18:50.008
I realized
the whole community aspect

18:50.009 --> 18:53.300
when the mayor asked me over
for cookies on Friday.

18:53.301 --> 18:54.841
It's an open house,

18:54.842 --> 18:57.217
so, actually,
everyone's invited.

18:57.218 --> 18:58.425
Right.

18:58.426 --> 19:00.550
No, I know he didn't
personally invite me.

19:06.842 --> 19:08.467
I'm sorry all this
got sprung on you.

19:09.884 --> 19:11.549
Well, what can you do?

19:11.550 --> 19:12.633
You okay?

19:12.634 --> 19:14.299
Yeah.

19:14.300 --> 19:15.550
Yeah, I'm good.

19:16.925 --> 19:17.965
How about you, though?

19:17.966 --> 19:20.175
I mean, this island
is pretty relaxed.

19:22.299 --> 19:23.299
I can relax.

19:24.466 --> 19:25.466
What? I can.

19:25.467 --> 19:26.799
People can change, you know?

19:26.800 --> 19:28.466
There are times
I'm downright spontaneous.

19:30.633 --> 19:31.591
Allow me to give you a hand.

19:31.592 --> 19:32.798
See? I'm being spontaneous.

19:32.799 --> 19:35.423
Can you just hold
this end of the bench, please?

19:35.424 --> 19:36.798
- Hold that end?
- Great. Thanks.

19:36.799 --> 19:38.719
You know, I actually think
it would looks good...

19:39.632 --> 19:41.132
Right. Just holding.

19:44.173 --> 19:45.813
- So is this the...
- So, what have you...

19:48.590 --> 19:51.172
I was gonna ask
what you've been up to.

19:51.173 --> 19:53.172
Yeah.

19:53.173 --> 19:55.422
I'm at K & J Records now.

19:55.423 --> 19:56.797
It's actually
a pretty big week for me,

19:56.798 --> 19:58.838
I just finished my first album.

19:59.039 --> 19:59.922
Yeah!

19:59.923 --> 20:01.172
Yeah.

20:01.173 --> 20:02.733
It's been good
to be back in the studio.

20:03.631 --> 20:06.005
Are you singing
all original stuff or...

20:06.006 --> 20:08.464
No, no, I'm not singing,
I'm producing.

20:09.922 --> 20:12.004
Have you heard of Ashleigh Z?

20:12.005 --> 20:13.629
Yeah, "Barefoot in the Rain"
Ashleigh Z?

20:13.630 --> 20:14.588
That's the one.

20:14.589 --> 20:16.464
I'm producing her next album.

20:18.214 --> 20:19.755
Wait, are you kidding?
That is huge.

20:21.296 --> 20:22.379
How did you...

20:22.380 --> 20:24.587
She heard a remix I did
of "Wichita Lineman"

20:24.588 --> 20:25.671
and loved it

20:25.672 --> 20:26.712
and told the label

20:26.713 --> 20:27.796
she wanted me
to produce her next album,

20:27.797 --> 20:28.797
so here I am.

20:28.798 --> 20:31.672
Congratulations.

20:33.338 --> 20:34.338
Thank you.

20:35.837 --> 20:37.128
But enough about me.
How are you?

20:37.129 --> 20:39.088
How is life on the island?

20:40.337 --> 20:41.544
It's...
It's good.

20:41.545 --> 20:42.586
Would you sit?

20:42.587 --> 20:43.711
I want to check the exposure.

20:43.712 --> 20:44.962
Sure.

20:46.545 --> 20:47.545
Are you still singing?

20:48.962 --> 20:50.044
Not really.

20:50.045 --> 20:52.294
Move to your left a little.

20:52.295 --> 20:53.669
You know, you should
really think about singing

20:53.670 --> 20:55.503
for all the weddings
that come through here.

20:56.961 --> 20:58.170
I'll keep that in mind.

21:01.169 --> 21:03.460
What a perfect spot.

21:03.461 --> 21:04.794
You guys look wonderful.

21:04.795 --> 21:07.085
I know.
He cleans up nice.

21:07.086 --> 21:08.044
He sure does.

21:08.045 --> 21:09.543
Why don't you have a seat?

21:09.544 --> 21:10.959
Let's get some shots here.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.793
And then I was thinking later
we could go down to the Cove.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.002
- Great.
- Great.

21:17.002 --> 21:18.043
What are you...
What are you doing?

21:18.044 --> 21:20.334
I'm just looking at the frame.

21:20.335 --> 21:21.918
Looks good. I would zoom in
a little, though.

21:21.919 --> 21:24.334
I haven't actually set up
the shot yet, Jake.

21:24.335 --> 21:26.085
Okay.

21:28.751 --> 21:30.250
Do you mind if I get in there
to do my job?

21:30.251 --> 21:32.250
You're the photographer.

21:32.251 --> 21:33.501
Right. I am.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.667
Thanks.

21:35.668 --> 21:36.626
Okay.

21:36.627 --> 21:38.043
Nice big smiles.

21:39.459 --> 21:41.542
Jennifer, tell me
about your first date with Kyle.

21:43.668 --> 21:44.916
Maggie,

21:44.917 --> 21:47.292
it was at Conklin's.

21:48.292 --> 21:49.292
How would I know that?

21:51.334 --> 21:52.499
Because you were there,
remember?

21:52.500 --> 21:53.582
Yeah.

21:53.583 --> 21:55.023
We came to watch
you and Jake play...

21:57.792 --> 21:59.374
Right... right.

21:59.375 --> 22:00.791
Conklin's.

22:00.792 --> 22:03.207
I'm so sorry I forgot, you two.

22:03.208 --> 22:04.499
Yeah, I mean, the one person

22:04.500 --> 22:06.625
that I wanted to find it
memorable is marrying me, so.

22:07.832 --> 22:08.832
We're good.

22:09.791 --> 22:10.791
You know what...

22:11.916 --> 22:13.582
Okay, nice big smiles!

22:14.874 --> 22:15.874
Beautiful.

22:55.122 --> 22:56.204
What are the chances?

22:56.205 --> 22:59.621
Well, it is the only cafe
on the island, so.

22:59.622 --> 23:01.287
Yeah.

23:01.288 --> 23:02.579
I see you got the cappuccino.

23:02.580 --> 23:04.162
I got that myself.

23:04.163 --> 23:05.454
I hear it's the best
on the island.

23:05.455 --> 23:07.455
Also, the only on the island.

23:11.121 --> 23:12.121
It's Ashleigh.

23:12.122 --> 23:13.787
She only texts.

23:13.788 --> 23:15.286
Apparently, karmically,

23:15.287 --> 23:16.954
it's the cleanest way
to communicate.

23:18.204 --> 23:19.286
Are these the pictures
from yesterday?

23:19.287 --> 23:20.746
Can I see?

23:23.162 --> 23:25.286
Actually, I should head off
to the hair salon

23:25.287 --> 23:27.453
to shoot Jennifer's
hair-style test for the wedding.

23:27.454 --> 23:28.994
The deluxe package.

23:28.995 --> 23:30.535
Yeah.

23:30.536 --> 23:33.702
I need some caffeine.
I'm fading.

23:33.703 --> 23:34.827
It's so dark and quiet here,

23:34.828 --> 23:36.285
I couldn't even fall asleep
last night.

23:36.286 --> 23:38.827
Yeah, it takes a minute
to get used to.

23:38.828 --> 23:40.952
I also can't help but worry
about the album.

23:43.328 --> 23:44.369
What's wrong?

23:44.370 --> 23:47.701
The engineer
hasn't sent the mixes

23:47.702 --> 23:50.493
and I need them like yesterday
to send back my notes.

23:50.494 --> 23:52.910
- You've always been very fast
at mixing notes.

23:52.911 --> 23:54.201
I know, but if this is delayed,

23:54.202 --> 23:56.576
then the mastering is late,

23:56.577 --> 23:57.951
and then
the release date is off,

23:57.952 --> 24:00.992
and this is just too big
for me to screw up, you know?

24:00.993 --> 24:03.326
I...

24:03.327 --> 24:04.701
And the timing of it is just...

24:08.701 --> 24:09.909
You're not kidding
about the relaxed pace.

24:09.910 --> 24:11.201
I mean...

24:11.202 --> 24:13.200
this cappuccino has been, like,
15 minutes in the making.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.700
Well, you can't rush

24:14.701 --> 24:16.492
the best cappuccino
on the island, can you?

24:16.493 --> 24:17.493
I guess not.

24:19.159 --> 24:20.159
- Thank you.
- Enjoy it.

24:21.326 --> 24:22.575
At least try to.

24:22.576 --> 24:24.493
It is your sister's wedding
after all.

24:45.033 --> 24:47.199
Okay, that photo,
you can delete.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.241
You need at least
one "before" photo.

24:50.741 --> 24:52.199
How's this for the "after"?

24:53.282 --> 24:54.698
That'll look beautiful on you.

24:54.699 --> 24:56.239
Jake was actually the one

24:56.240 --> 24:57.782
who picked out
that hairstyle for me.

24:57.783 --> 24:58.783
Really?

24:58.784 --> 25:00.074
Isn't he so helpful these days?

25:01.407 --> 25:02.739
Okay, what is her deal?

25:02.740 --> 25:04.239
Usually, she's an open book,

25:04.240 --> 25:07.781
but I didn't even know there was
a Colby & Case until yesterday.

25:07.782 --> 25:09.531
I'll tell you
anything you want to know.

25:11.281 --> 25:13.364
Don't mind me.
I'm just here to take pictures.

25:13.365 --> 25:15.030
Okay, so how did they
start singing together?

25:15.031 --> 25:17.238
Jake used to host
an open mic night

25:17.239 --> 25:19.155
at this little club
in Nashville called...

25:19.156 --> 25:21.280
The Eagle's Nest Cafe.

25:21.281 --> 25:23.946
Right.
She was taking pictures.

25:23.947 --> 25:26.821
And she ended up next to Jake.

25:26.822 --> 25:28.488
And she must have been
humming along or something,

25:28.489 --> 25:29.613
because Jake said,

25:29.614 --> 25:31.946
"You have really good pitch.
Are you a singer?"

25:31.947 --> 25:33.613
Oh, smooth.

25:33.614 --> 25:35.945
Well, she said no.

25:35.946 --> 25:36.905
You little liar.

25:36.906 --> 25:38.489
What I said was, "not tonight".

25:39.780 --> 25:40.987
I was new to the area,

25:40.988 --> 25:43.112
I'd never performed
in front of that many people.

25:43.113 --> 25:45.695
So, they chatted for awhile,

25:45.696 --> 25:47.904
and then Jake got up on stage
with his guitar

25:47.905 --> 25:50.529
and he announced Maggie
as the next singer.

25:51.571 --> 25:52.571
So romantic.

25:52.572 --> 25:54.445
Definitely not romantic.

25:54.446 --> 25:55.696
I was mortified.

25:56.613 --> 25:57.571
And...

25:57.572 --> 25:59.445
And... I knew
he wouldn't give up

25:59.446 --> 26:01.986
until I sang, so...

26:01.987 --> 26:03.819
I got on stage.

26:03.820 --> 26:05.486
She asked him
what songs he knew,

26:05.487 --> 26:06.487
and he said, "All of them".

26:06.488 --> 26:08.235
Oh, confident.

26:08.236 --> 26:09.319
Or arrogant.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.444
Only if he doesn't know
the songs you chose.

26:11.445 --> 26:13.152
Everybody knows
"Country Roads".

26:13.153 --> 26:14.654
I love that song.

26:15.944 --> 26:18.653
Halfway through,
he started singing the harmony,

26:18.654 --> 26:20.777
and then he did that thing

26:20.778 --> 26:22.610
where they both sing
into the same microphone.

26:22.611 --> 26:24.444
It's a classic move.

26:25.486 --> 26:26.610
- Hi, Jake.
- Hi.

26:26.611 --> 26:28.861
- I miss anything?
- No. Nothing.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.985
- Hey, man, how's the island?
- It's good, it's good.

26:37.986 --> 26:39.193
Hey, listen,

26:39.194 --> 26:40.069
I haven't gotten
any of the mixes yet.

26:40.070 --> 26:41.525
Hi, Jake.
It's Ashleigh.

26:41.526 --> 26:43.234
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.692
I've just been giving Kevin
some notes.

26:44.693 --> 26:45.942
Okay.

26:45.943 --> 26:47.443
They're on the way.

26:49.234 --> 26:50.275
Okay, great.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.067
Look, can we hang off
making any changes

26:52.068 --> 26:54.025
until I get to listen
to the tracks?

26:54.026 --> 26:55.068
Absolutely.

26:56.068 --> 26:57.609
Look, I got 'em.
Okay. Thanks.

26:57.610 --> 26:58.776
Bye, Jake.

27:04.525 --> 27:05.651
Seriously?

27:07.317 --> 27:08.941
Teddy! Teddy Bear!

27:08.942 --> 27:11.024
Teddy Bear Jamboree?

27:11.025 --> 27:12.608
Teddy Bear Jamboree wedding?

27:12.609 --> 27:13.940
Ring, bear...

27:13.941 --> 27:14.941
Ring-bear...

27:14.942 --> 27:16.609
- Ringbearer!
- Yes!

27:18.608 --> 27:19.900
Yes, that's it!
Ringbearer.

27:21.775 --> 27:23.899
We're behind.

27:23.900 --> 27:25.024
All right, here we go.

27:25.025 --> 27:26.066
Focus. Let's focus.

27:26.067 --> 27:28.566
Alright, good job, ladies.

27:29.608 --> 27:31.107
Let's see what we've got here.

27:32.274 --> 27:33.232
Okay, well, this is impossible

27:33.233 --> 27:34.273
so I'm going
to draw another one.

27:34.274 --> 27:35.398
No, no, no!
You can't do that.

27:35.399 --> 27:36.773
- Why not?
- Because those are the rules.

27:36.774 --> 27:39.273
Yeah. Since when did
the Colby family allow redraws?

27:39.274 --> 27:40.522
Never.

27:40.523 --> 27:42.065
Remember? I played this
once with you guys.

27:42.066 --> 27:44.315
I got the phrase
"All that glitters is gold".

27:45.273 --> 27:46.273
I remember that.

27:46.274 --> 27:47.439
Yeah, and I used up
the whole minute

27:47.440 --> 27:48.606
just drawing little dots
all over the paper.

27:48.607 --> 27:50.731
Well, I got it, didn't I?

27:50.732 --> 27:52.064
You did.

27:52.065 --> 27:53.772
That proves our point exactly.
No redraws.

27:53.773 --> 27:54.773
Okay, okay. Alright.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.939
It's fine, Jake, you got this.

27:58.106 --> 27:58.963
Ready?

27:59.265 --> 28:00.683
Okay. Go.

28:02.773 --> 28:03.856
A dress!

28:05.106 --> 28:06.897
Dress, dress, dress, dress.

28:06.898 --> 28:08.189
Dress. That's...

28:09.606 --> 28:11.104
That's a bouquet.
That's a bouquet.

28:11.105 --> 28:12.812
- Bouquet.
- Bridesmaid!

28:12.813 --> 28:13.938
Yes, yes, bridesmaids!

28:16.688 --> 28:18.208
"Always a bridesmaid,
never the bride".

28:19.105 --> 28:20.147
You're a genius.

28:26.396 --> 28:27.396
How did you get that?

28:36.188 --> 28:37.478
That was fun.

28:37.479 --> 28:38.437
Are you coming to dinner?

28:38.438 --> 28:39.770
Of course. Yeah, no.

28:39.771 --> 28:41.145
I'm just gonna run to my room,
see if the mixes downloaded.

28:41.146 --> 28:42.770
Okay. Don't work too hard.

28:42.771 --> 28:44.645
I won't.
I'll see you all there.

28:44.646 --> 28:46.102
They're probably not downloaded.

28:46.103 --> 28:48.811
It's a really old system
on the island.

28:48.812 --> 28:50.269
If you do need
to download faster,

28:50.270 --> 28:52.603
there's an Internet cafe
by the dock on the mainland.

28:52.604 --> 28:54.353
You could take
the ferry there tomorrow.

28:54.354 --> 28:56.602
Tomorrow?

28:56.603 --> 28:58.102
How do you put up
with this place?

28:58.103 --> 28:59.435
We don't really have the need

28:59.436 --> 29:00.935
to go back and forth
all the time.

29:00.936 --> 29:02.310
I need to listen
to these mixes tonight.

29:02.311 --> 29:04.102
It'll download
when it downloads.

29:06.102 --> 29:08.310
How do you do it?

29:08.311 --> 29:09.311
Do what?

29:09.312 --> 29:10.934
How do you always stay so calm?

29:10.935 --> 29:12.602
Well, I don't drink
double-shot cappuccinos.

29:12.603 --> 29:13.643
No. For real.

29:13.644 --> 29:14.851
Even when
we were playing together,

29:14.852 --> 29:16.436
you never stressed
about anything.

29:17.810 --> 29:19.185
You did enough of that
for the both of us.

29:19.186 --> 29:20.643
Maggie.

29:20.644 --> 29:22.809
Look, I can tell
you're concerned.

29:22.810 --> 29:24.434
It's just, there's no point

29:24.435 --> 29:26.235
in stressing over something
you can't control?

29:27.352 --> 29:29.017
Try to be in the moment.

29:29.018 --> 29:30.850
I wish it was that simple.

29:30.851 --> 29:32.267
I have a lot riding on this.

29:32.268 --> 29:33.975
I need this album to be great.

29:33.976 --> 29:35.393
Yeah, I've heard
that line before.

29:38.143 --> 29:39.600
You know,
it's not always a bad thing

29:39.601 --> 29:40.808
to want to be the best
at something.

29:40.809 --> 29:43.059
You're right.

29:43.060 --> 29:45.309
It's also not a bad thing
to try to enjoy the process.

29:46.601 --> 29:48.184
I'll see you tomorrow.

30:20.058 --> 30:21.556
Sasha, let me help you
with those.

30:21.557 --> 30:22.681
Thanks.

30:22.682 --> 30:23.557
The guests arrive Thursday,

30:23.558 --> 30:24.681
so I'm just getting

30:24.682 --> 30:26.181
some last-minute items
for the welcome packs.

30:26.182 --> 30:28.764
And I confirmed with Julio
for the salsa lesson tonight.

30:28.765 --> 30:30.431
Jake is gonna love that.

30:30.432 --> 30:32.056
He took one salsa class
in college,

30:32.057 --> 30:34.097
and he fancies himself a pro.

30:34.098 --> 30:36.597
How are you feeling
with all that by the way?

30:36.598 --> 30:38.097
It must be so strange
seeing him again.

30:38.098 --> 30:40.722
Yeah, I feel like
I've seen Jake more this week

30:40.723 --> 30:42.097
than in the two years we dated.

30:43.097 --> 30:44.888
I'm sure that feels...

30:44.889 --> 30:46.263
different.

30:46.264 --> 30:48.388
Yeah, but maybe
it's in a good way.

30:48.389 --> 30:49.679
I mean, he's been
super helpful to Jennifer.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.929
How about you?
How are you doing?

30:51.930 --> 30:53.305
Well...

30:53.306 --> 30:56.262
I got an official offer
from MVR Events.

30:56.263 --> 30:58.262
But they need to know by Monday.

30:58.263 --> 30:59.429
Well, that's great.

30:59.430 --> 31:00.929
Are you gonna take it?

31:00.930 --> 31:02.262
I don't know what to do.

31:02.263 --> 31:03.638
I want to talk to Evelyn,

31:03.639 --> 31:04.887
but I'm getting this feeling

31:04.888 --> 31:07.762
that she's not happy
with my work or something.

31:07.763 --> 31:08.763
What? No...

31:08.764 --> 31:10.429
I made
this really nice one-pager

31:10.430 --> 31:13.428
for who the guests should call
in case of a problem.

31:13.429 --> 31:15.220
You know, so they don't
bother the bride.

31:15.221 --> 31:16.470
Fantastic idea.

31:16.471 --> 31:17.762
I thought so, too,

31:17.763 --> 31:19.678
but every time
I tried to talk to Evelyn

31:19.679 --> 31:22.136
about incorporating it
into all of the weddings,

31:22.137 --> 31:24.596
she just said,
"We'll talk about it later".

31:26.554 --> 31:28.637
Well, keep trying talk to her.

31:34.928 --> 31:36.636
Mind if I join you?

31:36.637 --> 31:38.428
Sure.

31:39.887 --> 31:41.761
This is an amazing cappuccino.

31:41.762 --> 31:42.762
I had to get another one.

31:42.763 --> 31:44.469
You seem chipper.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.344
I am.

31:46.345 --> 31:47.345
Got the mixes last night.

31:47.346 --> 31:48.510
They sound great.

31:48.511 --> 31:50.302
Congratulations.

31:50.303 --> 31:51.385
Thank you.
It's exciting.

31:51.386 --> 31:52.843
And I just found out

31:52.844 --> 31:53.968
that the studio

31:53.969 --> 31:55.926
is going to send me
to supervise the tour.

31:55.927 --> 31:57.636
Oh, my gosh.
That's incredible.

31:58.677 --> 32:00.260
Guess where
they're gonna kick it off.

32:02.636 --> 32:03.925
Alright, I'll tell you.

32:03.926 --> 32:06.218
The Olympia, in Paris.

32:07.885 --> 32:10.134
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

32:10.135 --> 32:11.425
That is an amazing venue.

32:11.426 --> 32:13.885
I can't believe you're going
to get to play there.

32:15.468 --> 32:16.426
Well, I mean...
I'm not...

32:16.427 --> 32:18.592
I'm not playing there, you know?

32:18.593 --> 32:19.593
I'm just...

32:19.594 --> 32:21.091
They're just sending me
to supervise.

32:21.092 --> 32:23.300
Jake, you don't have to
downplay it.

32:23.301 --> 32:26.883
You're her producer.
That's a big deal.

32:26.884 --> 32:27.884
You have every right
to be excited.

32:27.885 --> 32:29.216
I know, it's just

32:29.217 --> 32:31.633
you and I talked about.
playing there with Colby & Case.

32:31.634 --> 32:32.674
I didn't want you to think
that I was...

32:32.675 --> 32:35.174
No, Jake, I'm...

32:35.175 --> 32:36.383
I'm really happy for you.

32:38.133 --> 32:40.674
- Honestly.
- Thanks, Mags.

32:40.675 --> 32:41.840
You've always been
so supportive.

32:41.841 --> 32:42.841
It means a lot.

32:42.842 --> 32:44.215
You deserve it.

32:44.216 --> 32:45.757
You're...

32:45.758 --> 32:46.966
you're really talented.

32:47.966 --> 32:48.966
You are, too.

32:54.341 --> 32:55.506
I should...

32:55.507 --> 32:56.673
get going.

32:56.674 --> 32:58.382
You can't stay for a minute?

33:00.882 --> 33:04.048
I don't have time right now.

33:04.049 --> 33:05.549
But...

33:07.424 --> 33:08.756
I'm sure I'll see you around.

33:08.757 --> 33:09.840
Looking forward to it.

33:29.589 --> 33:30.589
Give me a twirl.

33:47.255 --> 33:48.296
Bueno, bueno.

33:48.297 --> 33:49.879
You learn very quick.

33:49.880 --> 33:51.920
Now let's do it again
with passion.

33:51.921 --> 33:53.421
Okay, everybody,
face your partner.

33:54.463 --> 33:56.128
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I'm sorry.

33:56.129 --> 33:57.754
You missed the lesson.

33:57.755 --> 33:59.587
Well, I took a salsa class
in college,

33:59.588 --> 34:00.588
so I think I can keep up.

34:00.589 --> 34:02.295
Good.

34:02.296 --> 34:03.379
We'll put you in front.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.544
- Okay.
- Hey.

34:07.545 --> 34:09.293
We're short a partner.

34:09.295 --> 34:11.960
Maggie, why don't you dance
with Jake?

34:11.962 --> 34:13.210
Oh, no.

34:13.210 --> 34:14.918
I need to take photos.
The deluxe package, remember?

34:14.920 --> 34:17.377
I don't mind if there are
no pictures of this.

34:17.378 --> 34:18.418
You know what, I can...
I can just watch.

34:18.420 --> 34:19.628
No, no, no.

34:19.629 --> 34:20.918
You cannot let all that
dance training go to waste?

34:20.918 --> 34:21.918
Come on!

34:26.878 --> 34:28.253
You did that on purpose.

34:39.918 --> 34:41.168
Five, six, seven, eight.

34:41.168 --> 34:42.667
In salsa, you pause
on the four and the eight.

34:42.668 --> 34:45.252
- I know, Jake.
- Okay.

34:46.252 --> 34:47.626
One, two, three, pause.

34:47.627 --> 34:48.917
Five, six, seven, pause.

34:48.918 --> 34:50.583
One, two, three, pause...

34:50.585 --> 34:52.125
Five, six, seven, pause.

34:52.126 --> 34:53.958
I'm just trying to help.

34:53.958 --> 34:54.958
Well, you're not.

34:55.918 --> 34:57.125
Maybe if you relax
your hand a little bit?

34:57.126 --> 34:58.126
My hand is fine.

34:59.460 --> 35:01.876
First of all, you are
too far away from each other.

35:05.542 --> 35:06.917
We need tension here.

35:07.876 --> 35:10.000
So my hand shouldn't be relaxed?

35:10.001 --> 35:11.625
Good. Thank you.

35:11.626 --> 35:14.083
Let's try again.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.333
Try this.

35:21.334 --> 35:23.791
Close your eyes
and just listen to the music.

35:28.207 --> 35:30.081
Five, six, seven, eight.

35:30.082 --> 35:31.041
Step, step, hold...

35:31.042 --> 35:32.206
Step, step, hold.
Step, step, hold.

35:32.207 --> 35:33.625
Step, step, hold.

35:43.957 --> 35:46.317
You two dance much better when
you don't look at each other.

35:47.373 --> 35:48.373
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:48.374 --> 35:50.707
that's how you dance
with passion.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.539
Hi, Maggie.

36:07.581 --> 36:08.581
If you're looking for Evelyn,

36:08.582 --> 36:09.747
she's already left

36:09.748 --> 36:12.580
to help with
the fire cookout tonight.

36:12.581 --> 36:13.912
I was just going
to run up to the office

36:13.913 --> 36:15.913
and drop off the mock-up
for Tricia's brochure.

36:17.247 --> 36:19.038
Here. Let me help you
with that.

36:19.039 --> 36:20.747
- Thanks.
- Of course.

36:21.872 --> 36:23.704
So, I heard you and Jake

36:23.705 --> 36:25.913
were quite the hit
at salsa yesterday.

36:27.039 --> 36:29.872
It was more like
we moved around while we fought.

36:31.538 --> 36:32.953
He just can't help himself.

36:32.954 --> 36:35.078
It's like...

36:35.079 --> 36:37.330
It's like when we sang together.

36:40.371 --> 36:41.953
So, Jake and I got asked

36:41.954 --> 36:44.578
to be in a showcase
for this record producer.

36:44.579 --> 36:47.411
And Jake kept obsessing
about everything.

36:47.412 --> 36:49.411
The lyrics, the harmonies.

36:49.412 --> 36:52.869
And even though we had performed
this song a million times,

36:52.870 --> 36:55.910
he kept changing things
at the last minute.

36:55.911 --> 36:59.973
So, when we got up there,
I just...

37:02.245 --> 37:03.870
It was not good.

37:05.078 --> 37:07.243
Needless to say,

37:07.244 --> 37:10.411
the label didn't sign us
and the producer lost interest.

37:13.494 --> 37:15.410
We were just so...

37:15.411 --> 37:17.702
different with how we handled
that kind of thing.

37:20.493 --> 37:22.118
You never wanted
to try it on your own?

37:22.119 --> 37:24.118
After going through all that...

37:24.119 --> 37:26.618
No.

37:26.619 --> 37:27.826
It...

37:27.827 --> 37:29.451
It's just too hard.

37:29.452 --> 37:32.576
I love singing so much,

37:32.577 --> 37:35.201
I didn't want to associate it
with rejection.

37:37.451 --> 37:39.450
So now it's just...

37:39.451 --> 37:40.451
a hobby.

37:48.743 --> 37:50.033
It is also tradition

37:50.034 --> 37:52.451
that we say a few kind words
about the bride and groom.

37:53.576 --> 37:57.325
Growing up, Kyle was like
an older brother to me.

37:57.326 --> 37:58.532
He taught me
how to play basketball,

37:58.533 --> 37:59.574
how to ride a bike...

37:59.575 --> 38:01.908
He even taught me
how to talk to girls.

38:03.366 --> 38:05.198
And while I'm tempted
to use this moment

38:05.199 --> 38:08.782
to kind of say
an embarrassing story about him,

38:08.783 --> 38:10.616
I'll just say...

38:10.617 --> 38:12.574
I'm proud of you, brother.

38:12.575 --> 38:13.907
You found a good one.

38:16.033 --> 38:17.948
Jennifer called me

38:17.949 --> 38:19.781
the night after
her first date with Kyle,

38:19.782 --> 38:22.116
and she said,
"I think I found the one".

38:23.282 --> 38:24.949
And when I met him,
I knew she was right.

38:26.365 --> 38:28.364
So here's to a wonderful couple

38:28.365 --> 38:31.114
and a perfect night
on this beautiful island.

38:31.115 --> 38:32.532
- We love you.
- We love you.

38:34.907 --> 38:36.032
Thank you.

38:39.906 --> 38:42.405
You know what would be amazing?

38:42.406 --> 38:44.196
If Jake and Maggie
sang something.

38:44.197 --> 38:45.322
Yeah.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.863
Oh, no.
Jenn, I don't think so.

38:47.864 --> 38:49.696
Why not?

38:49.697 --> 38:51.363
Well, because,
I... I don't have my guitar.

38:51.364 --> 38:53.364
You know, Evelyn told me
to bring it. I actually have it.

38:55.072 --> 38:57.238
- What do you think?
- I think I'd rather not.

38:57.239 --> 38:58.738
Oh, please?

38:58.739 --> 39:01.071
For old times' sake.

39:01.072 --> 39:02.779
Maybe... maybe Jake should
just sing something by himself.

39:02.780 --> 39:04.487
Well, she didn't ask me.

39:04.488 --> 39:05.697
She asked us.

39:06.739 --> 39:07.739
Please?

39:10.238 --> 39:11.571
I'm so excited.

39:12.904 --> 39:13.904
Come on.

39:16.071 --> 39:17.113
Let's see here...

39:18.404 --> 39:20.571
- What are you doing?
- A little out of tune.

39:21.779 --> 39:22.903
- Well, it's... it's...
- I was just gonna play.

39:22.904 --> 39:24.902
No, it's my guitar.

39:24.903 --> 39:26.278
I will play.

39:26.279 --> 39:27.696
Okay.

39:29.737 --> 39:30.902
How about...

39:30.903 --> 39:32.446
"For the Road"?

39:33.820 --> 39:35.278
How about...

39:35.279 --> 39:37.069
"Feel the Earth"?

39:37.070 --> 39:38.070
Great.

39:38.071 --> 39:39.569
I don't know any of those songs.

39:39.570 --> 39:41.193
That's because we wrote them.

39:41.194 --> 39:42.695
They write their own songs?

40:50.482 --> 40:51.482
I have an idea.

40:53.233 --> 40:54.690
I know we chose
the song "Everything"

40:54.691 --> 40:55.857
for our first dance,

40:55.858 --> 40:58.148
but Jake and Maggie

40:58.149 --> 41:00.858
have this beautiful song called
"I Belong in Your Arms".

41:01.816 --> 41:02.856
What if they did that instead?

41:02.857 --> 41:04.398
What do you think?

41:04.399 --> 41:05.357
I love it.

41:05.358 --> 41:06.939
Jenn, no.

41:06.940 --> 41:08.024
Please?

41:09.523 --> 41:10.647
Who's gonna take pictures
of your first dance

41:10.648 --> 41:11.689
if I'm singing?

41:11.690 --> 41:12.690
I can do it.

41:15.189 --> 41:16.856
Jake, I don't think
this is a good idea.

41:16.857 --> 41:18.355
It's just one song.

41:18.356 --> 41:19.397
Yeah, but we don't have
a very good track record

41:19.398 --> 41:20.938
with "just one song".

41:20.939 --> 41:21.980
You're right.

41:21.981 --> 41:23.581
You're absolutely right
about everything.

41:24.356 --> 41:25.564
Thank you.

41:25.565 --> 41:27.813
Except...

41:27.814 --> 41:29.689
it's my sister's wedding.

41:30.814 --> 41:33.521
And I know that
if we sang, that...

41:33.522 --> 41:34.856
she'd be really happy.

41:36.731 --> 41:38.814
But, you know,
no pressure, obviously.

41:43.230 --> 41:44.230
Okay.

41:50.230 --> 41:51.605
Thank you, of course.

41:55.396 --> 41:57.061
Hey...

41:57.062 --> 41:58.520
thank you.

41:58.521 --> 41:59.562
No changing anything.

41:59.563 --> 42:00.811
No changes.

42:00.812 --> 42:01.895
Promise.

42:14.729 --> 42:16.603
Good morning, Nana.

42:16.604 --> 42:18.061
No one's around.

42:19.228 --> 42:20.312
Good morning.

42:21.353 --> 42:24.102
You and Jake sounded great
last night.

42:24.103 --> 42:25.936
Yeah, it was
actually kind of fun.

42:27.061 --> 42:28.560
Time for a reunion tour?

42:28.561 --> 42:30.393
No.

42:30.394 --> 42:31.768
This is just a one-time thing.

42:31.769 --> 42:34.226
It's not what I do anymore.

42:34.227 --> 42:35.435
Maybe not...

42:35.436 --> 42:36.935
but maybe it should be.

42:38.436 --> 42:40.727
Maggie, you've always been
such a great singer.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.352
And that song...

42:44.394 --> 42:45.768
That is a great song.

42:47.144 --> 42:48.184
I haven't forgotten

42:48.185 --> 42:50.392
what a talented
songwriter you are.

42:50.393 --> 42:52.267
Thanks.

42:52.268 --> 42:53.642
But...

42:53.643 --> 42:56.058
it's time to move on, Nana.

42:56.059 --> 42:59.184
I'm not sure this is something
you can move on from.

43:02.226 --> 43:03.435
Just think about it.

44:35.971 --> 44:37.554
That went well.

44:37.555 --> 44:39.304
Yeah, it's amazing
how fun it can be

44:39.305 --> 44:40.345
when it's for the love of it

44:40.346 --> 44:42.054
and not for the labels
or producers.

44:44.387 --> 44:45.678
No offense.

44:45.679 --> 44:47.386
I think it's great that
you're working with Ashleigh.

44:47.387 --> 44:48.970
You know, I was listening
to the final mixes this morning

44:48.971 --> 44:53.261
and I realized whose voice
Ashleigh reminds me of...

44:53.262 --> 44:54.262
yours.

44:55.429 --> 44:57.012
In case you wanna listen...

44:59.012 --> 45:00.760
Remind me again
why don't you sing anymore?

45:00.761 --> 45:02.401
Well, I keep pretty busy
with photography.

45:03.595 --> 45:04.886
Okay, what about you?

45:06.177 --> 45:07.760
Well, I tried
the whole solo thing,

45:07.761 --> 45:10.552
but I never sounded
as good alone

45:10.553 --> 45:11.803
as we did together.

45:20.219 --> 45:21.718
Ashleigh likes to send
these texts

45:21.719 --> 45:22.926
that go on and on and on.

45:22.927 --> 45:24.718
I just gotta scan it
and make sure everything's okay.

45:24.719 --> 45:25.885
Of course.

45:30.802 --> 45:31.968
The release is canceled.

45:33.718 --> 45:36.759
For the album?

45:37.718 --> 45:40.135
Yeah. We lost the rights
to one of the songs.

45:42.135 --> 45:44.055
Wait, I thought Ashleigh wrote
all her own stuff.

45:46.217 --> 45:48.049
Okay, Jake, I'm sure
you'll find another song.

45:48.050 --> 45:49.133
No, no, no.

45:49.134 --> 45:50.341
This song was like

45:50.342 --> 45:51.882
the concept the album
was built on.

45:51.883 --> 45:53.383
I can't just throw
another song in there.

45:53.384 --> 45:55.133
I should have seen this coming.

45:55.134 --> 45:56.216
Jake, there's no way
you could have known.

45:56.217 --> 45:57.466
No, I knew something was up

45:57.467 --> 45:59.632
when the songwriter
listened to what I did,

45:59.633 --> 46:02.299
and now, all of a sudden,
he wants to record it himself.

46:02.300 --> 46:04.049
I...

46:04.050 --> 46:05.050
I don't know.

46:05.051 --> 46:06.465
Jake, I'm so sorry.

46:06.466 --> 46:08.258
I know how hard
you've worked for this.

46:11.049 --> 46:12.173
I gotta go.

46:12.174 --> 46:13.715
I gotta see if I can
get ahold of her.

46:13.716 --> 46:15.300
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, okay.

46:20.424 --> 46:21.924
Alright, ladies.
Cheers!

46:24.799 --> 46:25.881
Perfect.

46:25.882 --> 46:27.507
So beautiful.

46:30.340 --> 46:31.880
Wedding pedicures,

46:31.881 --> 46:33.214
champagne...

46:33.215 --> 46:35.214
not a bad way to start the day.

46:35.215 --> 46:36.714
Only two more days.

46:36.715 --> 46:38.505
Are you ready?

46:38.506 --> 46:40.214
I can't believe
the wedding's almost here.

46:40.215 --> 46:41.173
It goes so fast.

46:41.174 --> 46:42.380
It really does.

46:42.381 --> 46:45.046
I really wouldn't have been
able to do any of this

46:45.047 --> 46:46.047
without Jake.

46:46.048 --> 46:49.171
He's been so great.

46:49.172 --> 46:50.838
Yeah. He really has been
watching out for you.

46:50.839 --> 46:53.214
Especially with everything
he's had going on.

46:55.381 --> 46:56.713
I just don't get it.

46:56.714 --> 46:59.462
I mean, there's got to be
a million songwriters out there

46:59.463 --> 47:00.671
who could write something.

47:00.672 --> 47:03.504
Apparently, she doesn't trust
a lot of people.

47:03.505 --> 47:05.671
He had to meet with her
about 12 times

47:05.672 --> 47:07.212
before she hired him.

47:07.213 --> 47:09.795
Looking good, ladies.

47:09.796 --> 47:12.379
So we have a lot
to get done downtown,

47:12.380 --> 47:13.878
so whenever
you're finished your drinks,

47:13.879 --> 47:15.337
the trolley is ready for ya.

47:15.338 --> 47:18.963
Here's to smelling flowers
and tasting cake!

47:25.880 --> 47:27.919
Are all of those roses
for my wedding?

47:27.920 --> 47:29.296
All of them.

47:36.878 --> 47:38.837
How do I look?

47:51.044 --> 47:52.710
This pistachio is so good.

47:52.711 --> 47:54.168
Hey, Evelyn sent me over

47:54.169 --> 47:56.918
with the all-important
cake topper.

47:56.919 --> 47:59.209
It's so beautiful.

47:59.210 --> 48:00.251
I should be on payroll

48:00.252 --> 48:01.710
with all the stuff
she's got me doing.

48:01.711 --> 48:03.751
We can only afford
to pay you in cake.

48:03.752 --> 48:05.252
Deal!

48:07.419 --> 48:08.918
Not that one, it's pistachio.

48:10.335 --> 48:11.335
So?

48:11.336 --> 48:12.875
You hate pistachio.

48:12.876 --> 48:15.251
I used to hate pistachio.

48:15.252 --> 48:16.917
So you just suddenly
like it now?

48:16.918 --> 48:18.042
Yeah.

48:18.043 --> 48:19.963
I've matured a lot
over the last couple of years.

48:20.459 --> 48:21.459
Yes.

48:21.460 --> 48:23.585
Very mature.
So mature.

48:27.709 --> 48:29.458
I just need you both
to sign here

48:29.459 --> 48:31.459
and then we'll get this
notarized.

48:33.750 --> 48:34.916
This is adorable.

48:34.917 --> 48:36.208
They should pass a law

48:36.209 --> 48:38.166
that all city clerk offices
should be in gazebos.

48:39.625 --> 48:40.708
You're in a good mood.

48:40.709 --> 48:42.309
Did you get the rights
to your song back?

48:43.625 --> 48:44.708
I called the writer to tell him

48:44.709 --> 48:46.207
how important the song was
for the album,

48:46.208 --> 48:48.040
but he made up his mind,

48:48.041 --> 48:50.040
he's going to record it himself.

48:50.041 --> 48:51.081
Then why are you so happy?

48:52.583 --> 48:54.416
I took advice from someone
I really respect.

48:55.958 --> 48:57.707
Is that so?

48:57.708 --> 48:58.708
I didn't want to fight it.

48:58.709 --> 49:00.873
I tried my best,

49:00.874 --> 49:02.415
but, it's like you always say,

49:02.416 --> 49:04.165
some things
are just out of my control.

49:05.624 --> 49:06.706
But I can control

49:06.707 --> 49:08.331
how much I enjoy this time
with my sister

49:08.332 --> 49:11.872
and make sure
this is special for her.

49:11.873 --> 49:13.872
That's what's important.

49:13.873 --> 49:15.415
Look how happy they are.

49:17.290 --> 49:18.530
Now, that's worth fighting for.

49:56.454 --> 49:57.870
- Is that everyone?
- Yep.

49:57.871 --> 49:59.787
Our population just doubled.

49:59.788 --> 50:01.203
Well, thank you, Mayor.

50:01.204 --> 50:02.704
Let's get a shot of you all.

50:02.705 --> 50:04.370
No.

50:04.371 --> 50:05.495
Maggie, come on.

50:05.496 --> 50:06.828
I want you to be
in a picture, too.

50:06.829 --> 50:08.370
Come on.

50:08.371 --> 50:09.537
Okay, sure.

50:27.536 --> 50:28.868
Hi, Maggie.

50:28.869 --> 50:30.203
Ooh, rough night's sleep?

50:31.369 --> 50:33.493
I'm going to talk to Evelyn
about my job offer today,

50:33.494 --> 50:35.076
so I got her
her favorite coffee.

50:35.077 --> 50:36.243
Smart.

50:36.244 --> 50:39.743
Sasha, you're amazing
at what you do.

50:39.744 --> 50:41.493
Just tell her what you want.

50:41.494 --> 50:42.734
She knows how valuable you are.

50:43.536 --> 50:44.785
Thanks, Maggie.

50:45.660 --> 50:46.994
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

51:02.285 --> 51:03.243
Good morning, Evelyn.

51:03.244 --> 51:04.700
Morning.

51:04.701 --> 51:07.700
Can I talk to you for a moment?

51:07.701 --> 51:09.034
Thank you.

51:25.658 --> 51:28.992
So, I've been working for you
for about three years now...

51:30.117 --> 51:32.866
...and I...
I love it.

51:35.867 --> 51:36.949
I need to take this.

51:37.991 --> 51:38.949
Hello, Tricia.

51:38.950 --> 51:41.283
We have a problem.

51:42.574 --> 51:44.864
I need you
to get Jennifer and Kyle

51:44.865 --> 51:46.864
and walk them
through the ceremony.

51:46.865 --> 51:48.322
I'll talk to you later.

51:48.323 --> 51:49.865
Okay.

51:51.156 --> 51:52.657
How bad is it?

52:02.115 --> 52:03.073
Perfect.

52:03.074 --> 52:04.365
Now Jake and Jennifer.

52:14.864 --> 52:16.655
Wait, so is this the archway?

52:16.656 --> 52:18.196
'Cause it just
looks like branches.

52:18.197 --> 52:19.155
No, no, no.

52:19.156 --> 52:20.737
It'll be covered
in flowers tomorrow.

52:20.738 --> 52:21.862
That's a lot of flowers.

52:21.863 --> 52:24.321
I just want it
to be perfect, you know?

52:24.322 --> 52:25.446
Trust me.
You'll love it.

52:26.488 --> 52:27.989
My little sister
is all grown up.

52:29.405 --> 52:31.363
- I want to see these.
- Yeah. Come look.

52:31.364 --> 52:34.779
Excuse me, everyone.

52:34.780 --> 52:36.362
I'm sorry.

52:36.363 --> 52:38.445
Why doesn't everyone
head back to the manor?

52:38.446 --> 52:40.488
I need to speak
with Jennifer and Kyle.

52:45.988 --> 52:46.988
Nana, what's wrong?

52:48.195 --> 52:51.528
Tricia's refrigerator
broke down last night

52:51.529 --> 52:53.654
and we have lost
a lot of flowers.

52:54.987 --> 52:58.611
The bouquets for the bride
and the bridesmaids are fine.

52:58.612 --> 52:59.570
Okay...

52:59.571 --> 53:02.112
But the other flowers...

53:04.987 --> 53:05.987
I'm so sorry.

53:08.319 --> 53:09.653
It's going to be alright.

53:11.486 --> 53:13.486
- I'm sorry.
- Jenn. Jenn.

53:18.528 --> 53:20.193
There's gotta be
another solution.

53:20.194 --> 53:21.693
I mean, well, look,
we're surrounded by flowers.

53:21.694 --> 53:23.401
Why can't we just pick these?

53:23.402 --> 53:24.693
But there are

53:24.694 --> 53:25.859
so many weddings happening
here this summer,

53:25.860 --> 53:27.484
we can't just ruin the gardens.

53:27.485 --> 53:28.485
What about the ferry?

53:28.486 --> 53:29.901
We could take it
back to the mainland,

53:29.902 --> 53:31.526
hit every flower shop,
and just buy them out.

53:31.527 --> 53:32.568
It's Friday,

53:32.569 --> 53:33.858
the ferry already ran,

53:33.859 --> 53:36.568
it's back at the dock
on the mainland.

53:36.569 --> 53:37.569
Wait, it's Friday?

53:37.769 --> 53:38.769
Yeah?

53:40.776 --> 53:41.776
It's Friday.

53:43.068 --> 53:45.526
- It's Friday.
- Come on.

53:50.359 --> 53:52.484
And only Mrs. McCready and I
know the recipe.

53:55.025 --> 53:56.025
They're amazing.

53:56.026 --> 53:57.066
I started making those

53:57.067 --> 53:59.774
when I first ran for mayor
25 years ago,

53:59.775 --> 54:01.358
and I've run unopposed
ever since.

54:05.191 --> 54:06.607
- Your Honor...
- Your Honor?

54:06.608 --> 54:07.774
When someone calls me
Your Honor,

54:07.775 --> 54:09.483
it usually means
they need a favor.

54:11.358 --> 54:12.650
Or they want the cookie recipe.

54:13.650 --> 54:14.567
No, I can't imagine

54:14.568 --> 54:15.731
you would divulge

54:15.732 --> 54:17.523
such a closely-held
government secret, so...

54:17.524 --> 54:18.524
What's the favor?

54:21.899 --> 54:23.315
- Well...
- Well...

54:29.274 --> 54:30.523
I can't believe that worked!

54:30.524 --> 54:31.524
Are you kidding,

54:31.525 --> 54:32.897
he couldn't resist
the Colby charm.

54:32.898 --> 54:34.772
I think it was
the Case charisma.

54:34.773 --> 54:36.605
You know,
I think it's really great

54:36.606 --> 54:37.981
how much you're doing
for Jennifer.

54:37.982 --> 54:40.273
Well, when something's
important, you make the effort.

54:40.274 --> 54:41.514
I just want to make it special.

54:42.982 --> 54:45.062
I can't wait to see her face
when she see's all this.

54:46.690 --> 54:48.605
Hey, thanks for all your help.

54:48.606 --> 54:50.272
And I'm glad
you weren't too upset

54:50.273 --> 54:51.854
when she surprised you
like that...

54:51.855 --> 54:53.605
surprised both of us.

54:53.606 --> 54:54.606
I was at first...

54:55.730 --> 54:57.730
But not anymore.

54:59.772 --> 55:00.938
If you'd known beforehand,

55:00.939 --> 55:02.699
you think you still
would have taken the job?

55:04.522 --> 55:06.271
I don't know.

55:06.272 --> 55:07.272
I'm glad I did.

55:09.188 --> 55:10.355
Yeah, me too.

55:12.313 --> 55:13.354
You know, it's nice to know

55:13.355 --> 55:15.020
that after
everything that's happened,

55:15.021 --> 55:16.261
we can still be friends, right?

55:33.687 --> 55:35.186
We've got flowers!

55:35.187 --> 55:36.229
Amazing!

55:38.187 --> 55:39.435
You two make quite the duo.

55:39.436 --> 55:41.269
I'm gonna go tell Jenn
the good news.

55:41.270 --> 55:42.478
Okay.

55:44.478 --> 55:45.519
I still can't believe

55:45.520 --> 55:47.435
you got flowers
from the mayor's garden.

55:47.436 --> 55:49.477
Well, I can't take
all the credit for that.

55:49.478 --> 55:52.060
Maggie agreed to do
a photo session with the Mayor.

55:52.061 --> 55:53.621
I'm pretty sure
that's what clinched it.

55:54.519 --> 55:55.851
It's been nice seeing her again.

55:55.852 --> 55:57.477
It has. Yeah.

55:58.561 --> 55:59.561
I have to say,

55:59.562 --> 56:01.226
when the two of you
were singing,

56:01.227 --> 56:02.519
it's like you never stopped.

56:03.686 --> 56:04.810
It was nice.

56:04.811 --> 56:07.227
Maybe this could be
the start of something.

56:08.561 --> 56:09.601
Don't you mean
the re-start of something?

56:09.602 --> 56:11.351
Well, now that
you're not leaving

56:11.352 --> 56:13.059
on a nine-month tour
to Europe...

56:13.060 --> 56:14.060
I don't know.

56:14.061 --> 56:15.726
Maggie seems pretty happy here.

56:17.060 --> 56:18.226
You're right, she does.

56:18.227 --> 56:20.517
Especially the last day or two.

56:20.518 --> 56:22.183
Okay.
The question is,

56:22.184 --> 56:24.559
how has the last day or two
been for you, huh?

56:24.560 --> 56:27.016
Are you ready?

56:27.017 --> 56:28.350
Huh?

56:28.351 --> 56:31.016
- I couldn't be happier.
- Good.

56:31.017 --> 56:32.297
I just want you
to be happy, too.

56:33.850 --> 56:35.975
No, my work is gonna be fine.

56:35.976 --> 56:36.976
Don't worry about me.

56:36.977 --> 56:39.182
I'm not talking about work.

56:39.183 --> 56:40.225
I'm talking about Maggie.

56:42.100 --> 56:44.850
I know you regret the way
the two of you ended things.

56:46.016 --> 56:47.891
Maybe this is your chance
to reconnect.

56:51.641 --> 56:54.182
I don't think she thinks of me
that way anymore.

56:54.183 --> 56:56.599
Well, do you still think
of her in that way?

57:02.683 --> 57:05.390
You get me, don't you?

57:05.391 --> 57:06.599
You get me.

57:35.514 --> 57:37.056
- Hi.
- Hi.

57:38.847 --> 57:40.179
Nice recording set-up.

57:40.180 --> 57:41.596
Thanks.

57:41.597 --> 57:44.596
And thanks for coming down.

57:44.597 --> 57:45.805
Sure.
What's up?

57:53.180 --> 57:55.512
Okay, you're starting
to freak me out now.

57:55.513 --> 57:57.721
No. I was just thinking
about Ashleigh's album.

57:58.763 --> 58:00.970
Jennifer said she doesn't
trust a lot of people,

58:00.971 --> 58:02.555
so what if the song
came from you?

58:04.263 --> 58:06.554
Well, I can't write
a song that fast.

58:06.555 --> 58:08.262
What if it was already written?

58:08.263 --> 58:09.844
I was looking at
that song we wrote,

58:09.845 --> 58:11.178
"Footsteps".

58:11.179 --> 58:12.678
It's a great song, Mags.

58:12.679 --> 58:13.679
I don't think it works
for the album, though.

58:13.680 --> 58:14.719
No, I know.

58:14.720 --> 58:17.178
I changed the key
and rewrote the lyrics.

58:19.178 --> 58:21.928
Now it's called
"Worth Fighting For".

58:27.178 --> 58:29.843
I can't believe
you did all this.

58:29.844 --> 58:32.761
Well, I know how excited
you were about the album.

58:34.344 --> 58:36.010
When you heard the mix,
you said everything was great,

58:36.011 --> 58:37.011
so...

58:38.844 --> 58:40.803
I wanted to help.

58:44.344 --> 58:45.510
These lyrics are great.

58:45.511 --> 58:47.968
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

58:47.969 --> 58:48.969
I mean...

58:49.969 --> 58:51.009
I mean...

58:51.010 --> 58:52.509
I mean, I've got to check in
with Ashleigh,

58:52.510 --> 58:54.175
but, I mean,

58:54.176 --> 58:56.096
there's a real chance
that she's gonna love this.

58:57.009 --> 58:58.676
I also recorded it.

58:58.677 --> 59:00.510
I thought
maybe you needed a demo.

59:02.009 --> 59:03.050
It's all on there

59:03.051 --> 59:04.300
if you want to send it
to Ashleigh.

59:04.301 --> 59:06.259
Or not.
Whatever you...

59:06.260 --> 59:07.967
- Whatever you want.
- Are you kidding?

59:07.968 --> 59:10.300
I mean, the least we can do
is try, right?

59:10.301 --> 59:11.800
I mean, honestly, no pressure.

59:11.801 --> 59:13.841
I... I had a lot of fun
doing it.

59:13.842 --> 59:15.550
It was...

59:15.551 --> 59:17.300
really nice making music again.

59:21.384 --> 59:22.758
Thank you.

59:35.508 --> 59:37.382
I should get going.

59:37.383 --> 59:39.257
I have to set up
for the rehearsal dinner.

59:39.258 --> 59:40.216
Yeah, no.

59:40.217 --> 59:41.257
I'll let you go.

59:41.258 --> 59:42.423
I'm going to listen to this

59:42.424 --> 59:44.507
and I'm going to send it
straight to Ashleigh.

59:44.508 --> 59:48.173
Mags, really...

59:48.174 --> 59:49.215
Thank you.

59:49.216 --> 59:50.507
You're welcome.

01:00:05.923 --> 01:00:08.048
This place
continues to surprise me.

01:00:08.923 --> 01:00:10.673
Jenn, look at these pictures.

01:00:20.838 --> 01:00:22.463
This deluxe package is no joke.

01:00:22.464 --> 01:00:25.255
Well, it's not actually
part of the "package".

01:00:25.256 --> 01:00:27.129
It's just something

01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:29.213
I thought Jennifer
would really enjoy.

01:00:29.214 --> 01:00:31.420
How did you find the time
to do all this?

01:00:31.421 --> 01:00:32.629
Well, when something's
important,

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:33.630
you make the effort.

01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:37.910
I want to make sure
it's special.

01:00:39.129 --> 01:00:41.380
Well, it's definitely special.

01:00:43.463 --> 01:00:44.962
Shall I get things started?

01:00:44.963 --> 01:00:46.962
No, I've got this.

01:00:46.963 --> 01:00:48.878
Welcome, everyone,

01:00:48.879 --> 01:00:51.211
to Jennifer and Kyle's
last night

01:00:51.212 --> 01:00:53.546
before they journey
into wedded bliss.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.253
Every couple
who gets married here

01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:01.419
signs their name on a shell
the night before they wed.

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:06.170
So, Jennifer and Kyle,
please come and sign your shell.

01:01:16.086 --> 01:01:20.627
Now let's all move inside
and get this party started.

01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:40.334
Okay...

01:01:40.335 --> 01:01:42.000
Next question.

01:01:42.001 --> 01:01:43.959
Who can name
the five starting players

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:47.126
from the 1997 World Champion
Chicago Bulls?

01:01:50.167 --> 01:01:51.607
- Really?
- You wanna bet against me?

01:01:53.167 --> 01:01:54.167
They seem to think Kyle.

01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:56.209
Jennifer and Kyle, who is it?

01:02:02.376 --> 01:02:03.376
Prove it.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:07.375
Pippin, Rodman, Longly,
Harper, Jordan.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.500
- What tiiiiime is it?
- Game time.

01:02:13.375 --> 01:02:15.582
Okay, next question.

01:02:15.583 --> 01:02:17.374
Who can perform, by heart,

01:02:17.375 --> 01:02:20.249
the entire NSYNC video,
"Bye Bye Bye"?

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.666
Okay... Who is it?

01:02:30.499 --> 01:02:32.499
Sasha, why aren't you up there
asking the question?

01:02:33.499 --> 01:02:34.872
Evelyn's got it covered.

01:02:34.873 --> 01:02:35.956
Sasha...

01:02:35.957 --> 01:02:37.830
I'm just...

01:02:37.831 --> 01:02:39.081
I'm gonna take the job
on the mainland.

01:02:39.082 --> 01:02:41.039
It's fine.
It's fine.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.623
The job is great.

01:02:43.873 --> 01:02:45.497
It's just that...

01:02:45.498 --> 01:02:48.289
Evelyn's never going to trust me
to take over the business.

01:02:49.331 --> 01:02:50.914
I think you may be
misreading this.

01:02:51.997 --> 01:02:53.080
I think my Nana

01:02:53.081 --> 01:02:55.663
is struggling more
with the idea of retiring

01:02:55.664 --> 01:02:56.956
than with trusting you.

01:02:57.997 --> 01:02:59.038
I'm not saying she's in denial,

01:02:59.039 --> 01:03:01.746
but she does make
her only granddaughter

01:03:01.747 --> 01:03:02.747
call her Evelyn.

01:03:05.372 --> 01:03:06.579
Really...

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.996
Really try to talk to her.

01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:10.830
Okay.

01:03:13.247 --> 01:03:14.621
Alright, final question.

01:03:14.622 --> 01:03:18.288
Who takes longer to get ready
for a night out?

01:03:19.955 --> 01:03:21.328
Get a good night's sleep
tonight.

01:03:21.329 --> 01:03:22.662
Good night.

01:03:22.663 --> 01:03:23.787
Thank you.

01:03:23.788 --> 01:03:25.746
Big day tomorrow.

01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:30.120
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:03:31.412 --> 01:03:33.203
You feel like talking a walk?

01:03:33.204 --> 01:03:35.620
Yeah. I would love that.

01:03:48.578 --> 01:03:50.161
Look at this place.

01:03:54.994 --> 01:03:57.785
This little lake
was my secret hideaway

01:03:57.786 --> 01:03:59.702
when my family used to vacation
here as a kid.

01:04:01.327 --> 01:04:02.285
So amazing.

01:04:02.286 --> 01:04:03.994
Come on.

01:04:27.743 --> 01:04:29.326
I used to spend hours out here.

01:04:30.451 --> 01:04:31.451
Actually...

01:04:33.159 --> 01:04:34.359
it's where
I wrote my first song.

01:04:34.759 --> 01:04:36.066
Really?

01:04:36.492 --> 01:04:37.699
You never told me that.

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:42.991
Something about floating
just made me want to write.

01:04:42.992 --> 01:04:45.324
It is still...

01:04:45.325 --> 01:04:46.908
and peaceful.

01:04:50.158 --> 01:04:51.242
You nervous about tomorrow?

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.991
No. I'm not the one
getting married.

01:04:55.991 --> 01:04:56.991
No. I mean about singing.

01:04:58.908 --> 01:05:01.990
Yeah, I thought I would be,
but I'm...

01:05:01.991 --> 01:05:03.198
I'm not, really.

01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:04.574
Yeah.
I'm looking forward to it.

01:05:05.407 --> 01:05:06.407
Me too.

01:05:08.533 --> 01:05:09.740
I...

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:13.114
I know there were times

01:05:13.115 --> 01:05:15.656
I could be pretty unbearable
when we were singing together.

01:05:15.657 --> 01:05:17.406
I'm sorry about that.

01:05:19.074 --> 01:05:20.074
It wasn't just you.

01:05:21.406 --> 01:05:23.072
I'm sorry I left the way I did.

01:05:23.073 --> 01:05:24.656
I was...

01:05:24.657 --> 01:05:25.782
I was just scared.

01:05:28.697 --> 01:05:30.072
Well, that's in the past.

01:05:30.073 --> 01:05:31.988
We're different people now.

01:05:31.989 --> 01:05:33.948
I know I've grown up a lot
since then.

01:05:35.073 --> 01:05:36.073
So have I.

01:05:37.864 --> 01:05:38.906
Yeah. I can tell.

01:05:40.906 --> 01:05:42.279
I'm so sorry!
I got you straight in the eye.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.405
My oar.

01:05:46.113 --> 01:05:47.405
Maggie!

01:05:48.364 --> 01:05:49.654
Maggie!

01:05:49.655 --> 01:05:51.364
I'm good, I'm good.

01:06:02.112 --> 01:06:03.571
Oh, no...

01:06:04.696 --> 01:06:07.112
Hurry and change
and meet me back at the manor.

01:06:08.321 --> 01:06:09.737
I can fix it.

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:25.818
Cell phone pilaf, my favorite.

01:06:25.819 --> 01:06:27.237
A Piedmount Island classic.

01:06:28.819 --> 01:06:29.860
Here, give me your phone.

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:31.777
This doesn't really work,
though, does it?

01:06:31.778 --> 01:06:34.361
- It hasn't failed me yet.
- Amazing.

01:06:35.569 --> 01:06:39.860
Hey, thanks for showing me
your secret hideaway.

01:06:39.861 --> 01:06:41.485
My pleasure.

01:06:41.486 --> 01:06:42.943
Even though I did dunk us
in freezing-cold water.

01:06:42.944 --> 01:06:43.944
Right.

01:06:43.945 --> 01:06:45.361
Sorry about that.

01:06:46.652 --> 01:06:48.609
It's been really nice
seeing you again.

01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:50.194
You too.

01:06:51.236 --> 01:06:52.527
Maybe we could...

01:06:53.818 --> 01:06:54.818
see more of each other?

01:06:58.777 --> 01:06:59.777
I'd like that.

01:07:02.652 --> 01:07:05.067
If...

01:07:05.068 --> 01:07:07.150
Ashleigh likes the song

01:07:07.151 --> 01:07:09.525
and the tour happens,

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:12.483
how long will you be gone?

01:07:12.484 --> 01:07:13.734
About a year.

01:07:15.484 --> 01:07:17.984
But, I mean, we don't know
what will happen.

01:07:20.651 --> 01:07:22.609
We could just take it
one day at a time.

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:35.690
You...

01:07:35.691 --> 01:07:37.981
you should go to sleep.

01:07:37.982 --> 01:07:39.650
You have a bride
to give away tomorrow.

01:07:40.691 --> 01:07:41.691
I do.

01:07:44.024 --> 01:07:45.316
Here. I'll see you tomorrow.

01:07:46.982 --> 01:07:48.565
- I will see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

01:08:21.648 --> 01:08:22.606
You got the rings?

01:08:22.607 --> 01:08:25.147
Right here.
You're ready.

01:09:04.437 --> 01:09:05.685
Ready?

01:09:05.685 --> 01:09:06.728
Nice and slow.

01:09:50.935 --> 01:09:53.808
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:09:53.809 --> 01:09:55.351
You may kiss the bride.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:33.140
Thank you, girls.

01:10:34.973 --> 01:10:37.223
So beautiful.
See? Like it?

01:10:37.224 --> 01:10:38.597
It could be a little better.

01:10:38.598 --> 01:10:40.224
I'm kidding.
No, you're doing great.

01:10:41.681 --> 01:10:42.722
How do you feel?

01:10:42.723 --> 01:10:43.681
Like I'm floating.

01:10:43.682 --> 01:10:45.514
It was
such a beautiful ceremony.

01:10:45.515 --> 01:10:47.097
Now it's time
to start the party.

01:10:47.098 --> 01:10:49.306
No, first,
we need some posed photos.

01:10:51.306 --> 01:10:52.306
What's wrong?

01:10:52.307 --> 01:10:54.180
This memory card's acting up.

01:10:54.181 --> 01:10:55.971
- What?
- No...

01:10:55.972 --> 01:10:56.972
The pictures I already took
are fine.

01:10:56.973 --> 01:10:58.013
It's just this card...

01:10:58.014 --> 01:11:00.347
Okay.

01:11:00.348 --> 01:11:01.429
I'm gonna head back
to my office,

01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:02.388
copy off the photos.

01:11:02.389 --> 01:11:03.931
I'll be 15 minutes, tops.

01:11:05.139 --> 01:11:06.346
While she's doing that,

01:11:06.347 --> 01:11:07.846
I've got a little something
for you in my room,

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:08.930
so I will be right back.

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.679
- We'll be right here.
- Okay.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.846
I'm just going to go up
and see if everyone's okay.

01:11:38.095 --> 01:11:39.095
Jenny-Jenn.

01:11:41.012 --> 01:11:42.802
Congratulations.

01:11:42.803 --> 01:11:44.720
Jake, you've already done
so much already.

01:11:54.178 --> 01:11:55.719
What is it?

01:11:57.719 --> 01:11:58.968
I just got a call from Ashleigh

01:11:58.969 --> 01:12:01.718
and she loved the song.

01:12:01.719 --> 01:12:03.218
- What?
- That's amazing.

01:12:03.219 --> 01:12:04.885
I know, I know. It's...

01:12:04.886 --> 01:12:06.468
The only thing is...

01:12:06.469 --> 01:12:07.801
in order to stay on schedule,

01:12:07.802 --> 01:12:09.426
they'd need to record it
first thing tomorrow morning,

01:12:09.427 --> 01:12:12.301
so she asked me
to fly a red eye back tonight.

01:12:12.302 --> 01:12:13.384
Then you have to go.

01:12:13.385 --> 01:12:16.134
What? No. No.
I can't leave your wedding.

01:12:16.135 --> 01:12:18.301
The ceremony was the wedding,

01:12:18.302 --> 01:12:20.092
which you were here for,

01:12:20.093 --> 01:12:21.550
and you gave me away.

01:12:21.551 --> 01:12:23.718
The whole week was perfect.

01:12:25.718 --> 01:12:27.091
You've worked so hard for this.

01:12:27.092 --> 01:12:29.467
I know, I know, but...

01:12:29.468 --> 01:12:30.468
You should go.

01:12:32.092 --> 01:12:33.925
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:12:33.926 --> 01:12:36.508
But, look, I don't even know
if there's a ferry today.

01:12:36.509 --> 01:12:37.799
Well, you're in luck,

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:39.466
because the next one leaves
in about seven minutes.

01:12:39.467 --> 01:12:40.633
What? No.

01:12:40.634 --> 01:12:41.966
We don't have to...
I'll just get the next ferry...

01:12:41.967 --> 01:12:43.050
whenever that is.

01:12:43.051 --> 01:12:44.132
There is no next one.

01:12:44.133 --> 01:12:46.090
What is with the ferry
on this island?

01:12:46.091 --> 01:12:47.966
Stop asking questions and go.

01:12:49.133 --> 01:12:52.090
Jake you're not just
producing anymore,

01:12:52.091 --> 01:12:54.132
there's a Colby & Case song
on this album now.

01:12:54.133 --> 01:12:55.299
I know, exactly,

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:57.174
so I need to stay
and tell Maggie the good news.

01:12:57.175 --> 01:12:58.841
- There's no time.
- I will tell her.

01:13:00.341 --> 01:13:01.716
Just go.

01:13:04.466 --> 01:13:06.298
Okay, okay, okay, all right.
Okay, all right.

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:08.089
Okay.

01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:09.090
Thank you.

01:13:22.715 --> 01:13:23.715
We're gonna make it.

01:13:26.381 --> 01:13:27.839
You think Maggie's
going to be upset?

01:13:29.048 --> 01:13:30.340
She'll understand.

01:13:40.714 --> 01:13:41.796
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:13:41.797 --> 01:13:43.422
You're going to make it!

01:13:47.339 --> 01:13:48.589
Wait!

01:13:49.796 --> 01:13:50.963
Wait! Wait!

01:13:52.005 --> 01:13:53.796
I have a...
Here, I have a ticket.

01:13:56.713 --> 01:13:57.713
All right.

01:13:57.714 --> 01:13:59.338
Let's get some pictures
of the newlyweds!

01:14:00.338 --> 01:14:01.129
Maggie...

01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:02.420
Ashleigh loved your song.

01:14:02.421 --> 01:14:03.629
She did?

01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:05.086
Yeah, she wants to use it
for the album.

01:14:05.087 --> 01:14:06.629
That's amazing!

01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:07.961
Where's Jake?

01:14:07.962 --> 01:14:09.128
In order to stay on schedule,

01:14:09.129 --> 01:14:10.586
they have to record
first thing tomorrow,

01:14:10.587 --> 01:14:11.587
so he had to go tonight.

01:14:11.588 --> 01:14:12.628
Wait. What?

01:14:12.629 --> 01:14:14.128
He really wanted to wait
to tell you himself,

01:14:14.129 --> 01:14:17.252
but the ferry was leaving,
and everything got so hectic...

01:14:17.253 --> 01:14:18.503
This is so exciting.

01:14:18.504 --> 01:14:20.836
The world's finally gonna hear
a Colby & Case song.

01:14:20.837 --> 01:14:23.420
Which means
that he'll be going on tour.

01:14:26.003 --> 01:14:27.752
Right.

01:14:27.753 --> 01:14:29.545
Okay...

01:14:31.794 --> 01:14:33.460
I'm so sorry, Maggie.

01:14:33.461 --> 01:14:34.919
No.

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.044
No, you know...

01:14:36.045 --> 01:14:37.045
you know what,
that's great news.

01:14:37.046 --> 01:14:38.335
It is.

01:14:38.336 --> 01:14:39.376
It's so great.

01:14:39.377 --> 01:14:40.543
Our song is gonna be
on a hit album

01:14:40.544 --> 01:14:42.793
and the two of you
just got married,

01:14:42.794 --> 01:14:46.627
so let's celebrate that
and take some pictures.

01:14:46.628 --> 01:14:48.751
Why don't you guys go grab
the rest of the wedding party

01:14:48.752 --> 01:14:51.169
and I'll head down to the pond
and set up?

01:14:55.252 --> 01:14:56.252
Are you okay?

01:14:57.627 --> 01:14:58.752
Fine.

01:15:30.417 --> 01:15:31.499
All right,
so you guys are all done.

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.124
You can head up
and enjoy the reception.

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:34.290
Your main job

01:15:34.291 --> 01:15:35.916
as the maid of honor
at the reception...

01:15:35.917 --> 01:15:37.790
to make sure the bride eats.

01:15:37.791 --> 01:15:39.041
And to catch the bouquet.

01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:42.790
- Thanks, Maggie.
- You bet.

01:15:42.791 --> 01:15:44.123
Come on.

01:15:44.124 --> 01:15:45.583
Let's get up there.

01:15:48.124 --> 01:15:49.540
Beautiful.

01:15:55.832 --> 01:15:57.582
Over there, please.
Thank you.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.080
Sasha, once the photos
are finished,

01:16:01.081 --> 01:16:03.332
- I'll introduce the newlyweds.
- I can do it.

01:16:03.367 --> 01:16:04.332
That's okay.
I've got it.

01:16:04.633 --> 01:16:05.973
Evelyn.

01:16:06.623 --> 01:16:08.622
I would like to do
the introduction.

01:16:08.623 --> 01:16:10.622
You are amazing at what you do,

01:16:10.623 --> 01:16:12.039
but someday,

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.360
you're going to have to hand off
the reins to someone else.

01:16:15.498 --> 01:16:16.956
And I'd like
that someone to be me.

01:16:18.122 --> 01:16:19.497
Is that so?

01:16:19.498 --> 01:16:22.622
I've been watching and learning
from you for three years now,

01:16:22.623 --> 01:16:27.163
and I know I can do it
and I know I can make you proud.

01:16:27.164 --> 01:16:28.454
And the truth is,

01:16:28.455 --> 01:16:29.935
I've been offered
another opportunity.

01:16:31.122 --> 01:16:33.121
But I love this island,

01:16:33.122 --> 01:16:34.454
and I was really hoping

01:16:34.455 --> 01:16:36.371
that you'd give me a reason
to turn them down.

01:16:38.288 --> 01:16:39.497
Another job offer, huh?

01:16:40.913 --> 01:16:41.954
Yes, ma'am.

01:16:43.787 --> 01:16:45.496
Well...

01:16:45.497 --> 01:16:46.746
in that case...

01:16:50.496 --> 01:16:51.496
Really?

01:16:52.621 --> 01:16:54.620
We'll start by making you
my partner.

01:16:54.621 --> 01:16:56.870
I am not going to retire.

01:16:56.871 --> 01:16:58.745
- Of course.
- I'm not.

01:16:58.746 --> 01:16:59.953
Understood.

01:17:03.037 --> 01:17:04.037
Now, get up there.

01:17:18.161 --> 01:17:20.535
I hear Jake had to go back.

01:17:20.536 --> 01:17:21.784
Yeah.

01:17:21.785 --> 01:17:22.993
Duty called.

01:17:22.994 --> 01:17:26.202
Now, I know
you are a grown woman,

01:17:26.203 --> 01:17:29.409
capable of making
your own decisions,

01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:32.576
but you'll always be
my little Magpie,

01:17:32.577 --> 01:17:34.827
and it's my job
to look out for you.

01:17:35.785 --> 01:17:36.868
Thanks, Nana.

01:17:36.869 --> 01:17:37.868
And...

01:17:37.869 --> 01:17:40.284
I think you've been here
long enough.

01:17:40.285 --> 01:17:41.826
What are you talking about?

01:17:43.285 --> 01:17:44.950
When you came here,

01:17:44.951 --> 01:17:46.367
you were hurting.

01:17:46.368 --> 01:17:48.076
And I gave you this job
to help you heal.

01:17:49.868 --> 01:17:51.408
Don't get me wrong,

01:17:51.409 --> 01:17:53.617
you are
a wonderful photographer.

01:17:53.618 --> 01:17:55.700
But...

01:17:55.701 --> 01:17:57.700
your music...

01:17:57.701 --> 01:18:01.283
I saw it at the fire pit.

01:18:01.284 --> 01:18:03.075
It's what you were born to do.

01:18:05.075 --> 01:18:06.284
If you don't trust me...

01:18:07.617 --> 01:18:08.617
trust the fact

01:18:08.618 --> 01:18:12.073
that you wrote a song, in a day,

01:18:12.074 --> 01:18:14.574
and Ashleigh Z loved it enough

01:18:14.575 --> 01:18:16.700
to make it the centerpiece
of her new album.

01:18:18.366 --> 01:18:20.283
You have to share your talent
with the world.

01:18:22.241 --> 01:18:23.282
Well, I'm not just gonna

01:18:23.283 --> 01:18:25.073
leave you
in a bind like this, Nana.

01:18:25.074 --> 01:18:26.074
You're not.

01:18:26.075 --> 01:18:28.115
I have a new partner,

01:18:28.116 --> 01:18:31.114
so I can go back
to what I was born to do...

01:18:31.115 --> 01:18:33.114
photography.

01:18:33.115 --> 01:18:34.741
Nana, are you firing me?

01:18:35.782 --> 01:18:38.906
I'm pushing you out of the nest.

01:18:38.907 --> 01:18:40.907
It's your time to fly.

01:18:44.032 --> 01:18:45.282
Thank you.

01:18:49.281 --> 01:18:51.280
Now, give your Nana the camera.

01:18:51.281 --> 01:18:52.447
Okay.

01:18:52.448 --> 01:18:54.448
- You have a song to sing.
- Okay.

01:19:06.989 --> 01:19:07.989
Thank you so much.

01:19:09.614 --> 01:19:11.362
Good afternoon, everyone.

01:19:11.363 --> 01:19:13.154
If you could please welcome,

01:19:13.155 --> 01:19:14.780
for the first time ever,

01:19:14.781 --> 01:19:17.196
as husband and wife...

01:19:17.197 --> 01:19:20.071
Kyle and Jennifer Robertson.

01:19:23.946 --> 01:19:25.987
And here to sing
their first dance

01:19:25.988 --> 01:19:27.529
is Maggie Case.

01:19:32.654 --> 01:19:33.778
Kyle and Jennifer

01:19:33.779 --> 01:19:35.612
have chosen something
very special

01:19:35.613 --> 01:19:38.028
for their first dance.

01:19:38.029 --> 01:19:42.153
It's a song written by me
and her brother, Jake.

01:19:42.154 --> 01:19:44.653
Jennifer and Kyle, we love you.

01:20:55.025 --> 01:20:56.773
We now invite everyone
to dance with the newlyweds.

01:20:56.774 --> 01:20:59.524
Jake, what are you doing here?

01:21:00.608 --> 01:21:01.900
Well, it's a duet, right?

01:21:02.774 --> 01:21:04.107
Well, yeah, but...

01:21:04.108 --> 01:21:06.232
You made me promise no changes.

01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:10.064
That's right.
I did make you promise.

01:21:10.065 --> 01:21:11.773
See, I do listen.

01:21:45.063 --> 01:21:46.938
Let's hear it
for the bride and groom.

01:22:02.063 --> 01:22:03.937
I can't believe
you made it back.

01:22:03.938 --> 01:22:06.604
Mags, the minute
the ferry pulled away,

01:22:06.605 --> 01:22:08.480
I knew I was making
a huge mistake.

01:22:09.605 --> 01:22:12.312
I realized that producing
isn't what makes me happy.

01:22:12.313 --> 01:22:15.188
What makes me happy
is singing with you.

01:22:16.979 --> 01:22:17.979
Me too, Jake.

01:22:19.437 --> 01:22:21.604
I had no idea how much
until they told me you left.

01:22:22.479 --> 01:22:25.144
But what about the song,
the tour?

01:22:25.145 --> 01:22:26.479
The Olympia in Paris?

01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:29.562
She still wants me
to do the Olympia.

01:22:31.562 --> 01:22:32.562
With you.

01:22:34.853 --> 01:22:35.853
What?

01:22:37.311 --> 01:22:38.685
She wants Colby & Case
to open for her.

01:22:38.686 --> 01:22:40.602
What did you say?

01:22:40.603 --> 01:22:43.227
I said I needed
to check with someone.

01:22:45.269 --> 01:22:46.310
So, what do you say?

01:22:46.311 --> 01:22:48.352
You want to get
the band back together?

01:22:49.643 --> 01:22:52.102
I think we're due
for a reunion tour.
