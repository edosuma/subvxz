09:32.541 --> 09:34.536
My goodness, honey,
you've been through enough.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.615
It is your sister who knows me best.

09:38.616 --> 09:40.977
She worked for me, she
understands better than anyone

09:40.978 --> 09:42.840
what I did or didn't do.

09:42.841 --> 09:44.481
I just haven't been able to reach her.

09:45.457 --> 09:47.436
So you want me to ask her for you?

09:47.910 --> 09:49.535
What I want...

09:50.972 --> 09:53.048
Is to see my granddaughters again...

09:53.778 --> 09:55.977
Before I die in here.

10:11.631 --> 10:13.719
I can't believe you're actually here!

10:13.720 --> 10:16.196
- Oh, I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

10:16.197 --> 10:19.532
- Oh, my goodness. Hey, it's so good to...
- Hey.

10:20.834 --> 10:22.416
- See you. How are you?
-  Hey.

10:22.417 --> 10:23.301
- Hey!
- Hi!

10:23.302 --> 10:24.464
Hey, look... look who came to visit.

10:24.465 --> 10:25.715
Yeah, that's... That's... that's great.

10:26.670 --> 10:27.364
Hey.

10:27.365 --> 10:28.773
So you've been writing with Luke Wheeler.

10:28.774 --> 10:30.084
What's that been like?

10:30.085 --> 10:31.478
It's... it's been good.

10:31.479 --> 10:34.311
- Hey.
- Uh, I've got a really quick rehearsal

10:34.312 --> 10:36.257
I have to go to. I just
got to fix my monitors.

10:36.258 --> 10:38.928
But I'll be done really soon.
You guys must be exhausted.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.974
You wanna go have a nap
or hang or explore? Or...

10:40.975 --> 10:43.218
I mean, I-I could take
'em around to the arena,

10:43.219 --> 10:44.613
show 'em around till you're done.

10:44.614 --> 10:46.723
Cool. I'll catch you guys later.

10:46.724 --> 10:47.995
- Okay.
-  Okay.

10:50.776 --> 10:52.411
- Thank you.
- All right.

10:52.412 --> 10:53.826
So how was he?

10:54.618 --> 10:56.587
<i>He's terrible. He looks...</i>

10:57.387 --> 10:58.432
Awful.

10:59.329 --> 11:01.044
Said he hadn't heard from you.

11:01.045 --> 11:03.690
Apparently, they're trying to
get him out on house arrest,

11:03.691 --> 11:05.573
but they need a character
witness to show up

11:05.574 --> 11:06.717
at his bail hearing.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.537
So did he ask you to do it?

11:08.538 --> 11:10.172
No, he asked me to ask you to do it...

11:10.586 --> 11:12.508
- Oh.
- Which was, frankly, a relief to me.

11:12.509 --> 11:14.859
Considering I don't exactly
have the loving relationship

11:14.860 --> 11:16.107
with him that you do.

11:16.108 --> 11:17.822
Well, I'm not exactly champing at the bit

11:17.823 --> 11:20.101
to defend him... At least not publicly.

11:20.734 --> 11:22.547
And there's gonna be so much press there.

11:22.548 --> 11:24.490
I'm just so torn about all of it...

11:24.491 --> 11:26.251
Everything with him, you know?

11:26.252 --> 11:27.842
But I hate the idea of
him sitting in that jail

11:27.843 --> 11:29.385
for who knows how long. We don't know

11:29.386 --> 11:30.791
when this thing is going to trial.

11:31.115 --> 11:32.520
He's not getting any younger.

11:32.521 --> 11:33.864
So you think I should do it?

11:33.865 --> 11:35.017
I don't know.

11:35.018 --> 11:36.432
I think maybe you should think about it.

11:36.433 --> 11:38.166
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna support him?

11:39.802 --> 11:41.481
I think that's what I need to think about.

11:41.482 --> 11:42.386
Yeah.

11:42.387 --> 11:44.203
I hope he's gonna be okay. We, uh...

11:44.204 --> 11:46.245
We were supposed to do
an interview this morning.

11:46.708 --> 11:48.770
Not anymore. The label canceled it.

11:51.138 --> 11:52.364
Could you get that for me?

11:52.700 --> 11:55.906
Of course. It's just
bruising. Should be fine.

11:55.907 --> 11:57.090
So I'm clear to perform?

11:57.804 --> 11:59.312
No guitar windmills,

11:59.313 --> 12:00.684
but otherwise, you're good to go.

12:01.191 --> 12:02.406
Thank you.

12:02.407 --> 12:04.275
So... what happened exactly?

12:05.177 --> 12:07.237
After-party just got a little out of hand.

12:07.988 --> 12:09.569
He dove off the bar.

12:09.570 --> 12:11.033
She's not even supposed to be at the bar.

12:11.034 --> 12:13.120
I was worried about
you. I'm your girlfriend.

12:13.121 --> 12:15.188
That's... That's what we do.

12:15.189 --> 12:17.276
But, you know, if... If
you don't care about me

12:17.277 --> 12:19.718
<i>caring about you anymore, then, uh...</i>

12:19.719 --> 12:21.398
Maybe this whole thing is pointless.

12:28.298 --> 12:30.474
Been getting into quite
a bit of trouble lately.

12:30.475 --> 12:33.406
We got reports that you got
into a fistfight in Houston?

12:33.407 --> 12:34.872
- True?
- Well...

12:35.311 --> 12:36.864
Edgehill wants a star.

12:36.865 --> 12:39.072
I'm just trying to live the life.

12:39.073 --> 12:40.702
The label would like you to stay alive

12:40.703 --> 12:42.624
long enough to record an album.

12:42.625 --> 12:44.947
So I get to be your constant companion

12:44.948 --> 12:47.279
from here on out. You are
just loving this, aren't you?

12:47.280 --> 12:48.692
Just doing my job.

12:49.527 --> 12:50.976
You sure about that?

12:52.997 --> 12:55.005
Fix things with Layla.

13:03.719 --> 13:05.967
Come in!

13:10.312 --> 13:11.964
I lost the paparazzi in Chicago.

13:13.139 --> 13:15.208
Are you sure? Because I have an image

13:15.209 --> 13:17.783
that I have worked very hard to repair,

13:17.784 --> 13:19.332
and the last thing I
need to add to the list

13:19.333 --> 13:21.024
- is "home wrecker."
- Okay, as far as anyone is concerned,

13:21.748 --> 13:23.073
I'm here on official business.

13:23.552 --> 13:26.465
So I promise you, you're my little secret.

13:26.466 --> 13:28.215
What are we doing?

13:28.216 --> 13:30.740
- Moving on with our lives together?
-  And to be with me,

13:30.741 --> 13:33.227
you're just gonna leave
behind half your fortune?

13:33.228 --> 13:34.618
Okay, you need to stop
reading the tabloids,

13:34.619 --> 13:36.410
'cause Olivia and I have a prenup.

13:36.411 --> 13:37.702
I still have plenty of money.

13:37.703 --> 13:39.359
I... have money, too.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.984
- Okay? I don't care about your money.
- Yes. Yes, I know.

13:41.398 --> 13:42.625
And you've earned it.

13:43.501 --> 13:45.650
Do you realize how special you are?

13:45.651 --> 13:47.956
You're the top 1% of the 1%.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.425
You're royalty.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.401
And you should never forget that.

13:55.288 --> 13:56.914
I like the way you see me.

13:58.644 --> 13:59.766
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:59.767 --> 14:01.451
- Come on in.
- Go ahead, sweetie.

14:01.452 --> 14:02.427
Hi. Thank you.

14:02.428 --> 14:04.020
I thought we'd set up
in there at that table,

14:04.021 --> 14:05.307
- if that's all right.
- Perfect.

14:05.308 --> 14:07.813
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Hey. Great.

14:09.801 --> 14:12.220
- Uh, you gonna hang out with us, or...
- No.

14:12.221 --> 14:13.667
This is... This is her thing.

14:13.668 --> 14:15.006
Uh, what time should I come back...

14:15.007 --> 14:17.863
- An hour?
- Uh, yeah, I guess so. Yeah.

14:17.864 --> 14:19.346
Just figuring it all out.

14:19.347 --> 14:20.936
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

14:20.937 --> 14:22.339
I'm ready.

14:25.090 --> 14:27.284
Hey!

14:27.285 --> 14:28.928
I didn't expect to see you home so soon.

14:28.929 --> 14:30.054
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.

14:30.055 --> 14:31.781
I didn't feel like running, okay?

14:31.782 --> 14:33.884
- Okay.
- I'm sorry. I'm just in a crap mood.

14:33.885 --> 14:35.858
That's all right. I've
been in one all week.

14:36.489 --> 14:38.254
Feelin' okay? Can I get you anything?

14:39.319 --> 14:40.379
I'm fine.

14:42.425 --> 14:44.295
I guess this is just
how it happens, you know?

14:44.296 --> 14:47.710
I mean, one day you feel this...  Magic,

14:47.711 --> 14:50.673
and then... It's just gone.

14:51.747 --> 14:53.253
It's like it never happened.

14:53.661 --> 14:55.329
Hey... listen.

14:56.139 --> 14:57.337
It did happen.

14:58.818 --> 15:00.639
And you are gonna feel that magic again.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.182
I promise.

15:02.183 --> 15:03.756
Why are you in such a bad mood?

15:03.757 --> 15:05.231
Oh...

15:05.232 --> 15:06.975
It's this thing with Maddie.

15:06.976 --> 15:08.089
She wants to take guitar lessons

15:08.090 --> 15:09.312
from Deacon Claybourne.

15:09.313 --> 15:11.051
I can understand why that would bother you.

15:11.052 --> 15:13.076
- Mm-hmm. - I mean, he
almost got her mother killed.

15:13.077 --> 15:15.373
- Exactly.
- Listen...

15:15.374 --> 15:16.803
Forget about him.

15:16.804 --> 15:20.016
Today is about you watching
your daughter perform,

15:20.635 --> 15:22.079
right?

15:22.080 --> 15:24.657
- Right.
- Getting to be the proud papa that you are.

15:25.713 --> 15:27.444
Damn right.

15:29.791 --> 15:32.029
This is the lounge. So what do you think?

15:32.993 --> 15:34.682
<i>Wow, this is awesome.</i>

15:34.683 --> 15:36.189
- Right?
- Hey... Pinball.

15:36.190 --> 15:38.849
I guess Luke likes to be
comfortable on the road.

15:38.850 --> 15:40.214
So you and Scarlett?

15:40.215 --> 15:44.042
Yeah. Yeah, it just, uh,
kinda happened, I guess.

15:44.043 --> 15:45.380
Cool.

15:45.381 --> 15:47.624
<i>♪ bad times make the
good times better ♪</i>

15:47.625 --> 15:49.329

- Uh, it's... it's on the right.

♪ And you're gone forever

15:54.336 --> 15:55.647
Hi.

15:57.258 --> 15:59.860
You didn't seem very
excited about me coming.

15:59.861 --> 16:01.271
I'm totally excited.

16:01.707 --> 16:03.445
The situation is a little weird.

16:04.332 --> 16:06.175
You never told me about Scarlett and Avery.

16:06.176 --> 16:08.895
I mean, I didn't... know
if they were a thing.

16:10.146 --> 16:12.708
I mean, honestly, I don't
know if we're a thing.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.314
It is a thing for me, all right?

16:18.688 --> 16:22.043
- It's a thing for me, too.
- Good.

Y'all seen this dressing room?

16:28.262 --> 16:30.601
Man, it's like a house.

16:30.602 --> 16:33.442
Uh, perks of being Luke Wheeler, man.

16:34.112 --> 16:35.444
- Mute that.
- Oh.

16:35.445 --> 16:36.936
I wish you could just show me.

16:37.659 --> 16:39.270
Uh, well, I only got about

16:39.271 --> 16:41.488
three chords in me nowadays.

16:41.489 --> 16:43.989
Don't they say that's all
you need to write a song?

16:44.500 --> 16:47.124
"Three chords and the truth,"
that's what they say, yeah.

16:48.457 --> 16:50.174
You know, I listen to your album a lot.

16:50.585 --> 16:52.040
It's really good.

16:52.041 --> 16:54.424
Oh, it's really old.

16:54.425 --> 16:55.790
Like... like me.

16:55.791 --> 16:57.357
Why didn't you make another one?

16:57.713 --> 16:59.430
Ah, I don't know.

16:59.431 --> 17:02.198
You know, I... I started
playing for your mom...

17:02.199 --> 17:04.888
And, uh... I might do another one...

17:05.648 --> 17:07.220
Now, you know?

17:07.221 --> 17:08.659
I actually just found
out I'm gonna be playin'

17:08.660 --> 17:11.240
- in that festival. I got a spot there.
- That's so awesome.

17:11.241 --> 17:12.624
- Is it?
- Yes.

17:12.625 --> 17:14.050
- That's so great.
- Yeah, well...

17:14.051 --> 17:16.547
Uh, it's just a few songs
in the little tent there,

17:16.977 --> 17:18.229
nothing big.

17:18.230 --> 17:20.278
- I'm playing one song...
- Where?

17:20.279 --> 17:21.950
- At an open mic for kids.
- Oh, yeah?

17:21.951 --> 17:23.916
- Yeah, at Two Old Hippies.
- Really?

17:23.917 --> 17:25.500
It would be really
awesome if you could come.

17:26.954 --> 17:28.253
I mean, uh...

17:28.992 --> 17:31.291
You are my guitar teacher.

17:33.666 --> 17:35.268
It's 30 minutes and out.

17:35.269 --> 17:38.240
- Ugh, what a waste.
- I'm sorry?

17:38.241 --> 17:39.864
Layla expanded her set last night,

17:39.865 --> 17:41.877
and our managers have to do a
little dance around each other

17:41.878 --> 17:43.527
so she won't do it again.

17:43.528 --> 17:45.175
Like that's gonna fix anything.

17:45.781 --> 17:47.981
So, uh, what are you gonna do?

17:47.982 --> 17:49.158
Well, I wanna bitch-slap her,

17:49.159 --> 17:51.107
but that's probably not
very good for business,

17:51.108 --> 17:52.881
is it, Mr. fortune 500?

17:52.882 --> 17:54.040
Oh, I don't know. I've never been, uh,

17:54.041 --> 17:56.275
beyond a little bitch-slapping
every now and again.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.868
- Mr. wentworth, hi!
- Hey.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.199
- What are you doing here?
- I, um,

17:59.200 --> 18:01.776
- I came to see the festival promo shoot.
- Oh, right.

18:01.777 --> 18:03.699
I was really sorry to
hear about your divorce.

18:04.827 --> 18:06.866
Aren't you just a font of empathy?

18:07.980 --> 18:09.779
I was thinking about our show,

18:09.780 --> 18:11.037
and I think it's better to have a boy

18:11.038 --> 18:12.406
- in between two girls.
- What?

18:12.734 --> 18:15.433
- I'm flipping your and Will's sets.
-  Right.

18:16.604 --> 18:19.624
Um... Juliette, I'm... I'm really sorry

18:19.625 --> 18:21.394
that I went over last night. I...

18:22.144 --> 18:23.290
I'm sure you understand.

18:23.291 --> 18:25.464
I just got... Overwhelmed by it all.

18:25.465 --> 18:27.200
Of course. You're probably just overtired,

18:27.201 --> 18:29.353
which is why this will
get you home safe and sound

18:29.354 --> 18:30.749
for your curfew.

18:32.533 --> 18:34.225

18:47.232 --> 18:48.953
Hey, Layla. There you are.

18:50.131 --> 18:51.442
You just come over to gloat?

18:52.057 --> 18:54.004
No. About what?

18:54.927 --> 18:56.691
Juliette flipped our sets.

18:57.665 --> 18:59.038
Well, I'm sorry.

18:59.039 --> 19:00.564
Why?

19:00.565 --> 19:01.757
It's good for you.

19:02.368 --> 19:03.912
Don't pretend to be bummed on my behalf.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.878
I'm not. I'm... Yeah, I'm happy

19:05.879 --> 19:07.446
to be able to play for more people,

19:07.447 --> 19:09.316
but I'm sorry you got
screwed in the process.

19:10.074 --> 19:11.149
<i>And...</i>

19:15.664 --> 19:18.073
I'm sorry about last night.

19:18.384 --> 19:19.715
I've been a jackass.

19:19.716 --> 19:21.376
I know how you can make it up to me.

19:22.743 --> 19:24.369
I'm not sure I can keep doing this.

19:24.969 --> 19:27.800
It's so hard not being
able to talk to my sister.

19:27.801 --> 19:30.489
I just feel like I'm losing my way here,

19:30.490 --> 19:33.014
with all the lying and the avoiding.

19:33.015 --> 19:35.658
Tandy... you're doing the right thing.

19:35.659 --> 19:38.886
My father's 65 years old,
and he is not doing well.

19:39.290 --> 19:42.357
Maybe I should just let
God be his judge and jury.

19:42.358 --> 19:44.468
Are you telling me this
because you are actually

19:44.469 --> 19:47.582
considering making a court
appearance on his behalf?

19:47.583 --> 19:50.290
After everything you know he's done.

19:50.291 --> 19:52.134
Because if you do, we will have no choice

19:52.135 --> 19:54.913
but to expose you as our star witness.

19:54.914 --> 19:59.081
Your father represents a
real danger to his enemies.

19:59.082 --> 20:00.951
Are you willing to risk
that just so he can enjoy

20:00.952 --> 20:02.534
the comforts of home?

20:08.543 --> 20:09.730
What?

20:09.731 --> 20:11.889
I was handling the Layla situation.

20:12.944 --> 20:14.484
Not fast enough.

20:14.872 --> 20:17.346
Well, now she's doing a
duet with will tonight...

20:17.347 --> 20:19.452
His last song. Her manager just told me.

20:19.453 --> 20:20.929
<i>That little snake.</i>

20:20.930 --> 20:22.355
She's a
19-year-old kid.

20:22.356 --> 20:23.916
She's gonna do 19-year-old
stuff sometimes.

20:23.917 --> 20:26.332
<i>Do you work for... her, or you work for me?</i>

20:26.333 --> 20:27.545
This isn't personal.

20:27.546 --> 20:30.111
I talk to the manager.
The manager talks to Layla.

20:30.112 --> 20:31.922
That's just how it works. You know this.

20:31.923 --> 20:33.619
Sometimes you gotta go right to the source

20:33.620 --> 20:35.998
and talk to them in a
language that they understand.

20:35.999 --> 20:37.713
What, you heard that from Charlie?

20:37.714 --> 20:39.820
Charlie has nothing to do
with running my business.

20:40.221 --> 20:41.538
No, he doesn't.

20:42.099 --> 20:43.117
But, you know, he does have a way

20:43.118 --> 20:44.891
of bringing out the worst in you.

20:44.892 --> 20:47.041
When I came back, I thought
you'd grown up a little bit.

20:47.836 --> 20:50.454
What, am I supposed to... feel bad

20:50.455 --> 20:52.611
because you're disappointed?

20:52.612 --> 20:54.296
Why don't you just go work for Layla?

20:54.297 --> 20:56.860
She's the appropriate age
for a disapproving daddy.

20:57.502 --> 20:58.866
For God sake.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.034
- Hey!
- Oh, my God.

21:05.370 --> 21:07.657
- Parking is a nightmare, isn't it?
- Um...

21:07.658 --> 21:09.196
- We saved you a spot up front.
- Oh... good.

21:09.543 --> 21:12.156
That way Maddie only has to
look one place to see her family.

21:12.833 --> 21:14.608
- Good thinking.
- Yeah.

21:14.609 --> 21:16.995
- Hi.
- She's, uh, I think she's a little nervous.

21:16.996 --> 21:18.172
Oh. She'll be okay.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.087
- What's he doing here?
-  Good afternoon,

21:21.088 --> 21:23.808
ladies and gentlemen, and
welcome to Two Old Hippies...

21:23.809 --> 21:25.398
Home of peace, love, and rock 'n roll.

21:25.399 --> 21:28.040
Beautiful Sunday, and we've
got a great kids open mic

21:28.041 --> 21:29.797
for y'all today.

21:29.798 --> 21:30.836
Seriously?

21:31.379 --> 21:33.276
This looks good enough to you?

21:33.277 --> 21:34.961
Hey, Juliette. Just wanted to let you know

21:34.962 --> 21:37.757
- that those, uh, promos look great.
- Get out.

21:38.499 --> 21:40.039
Y'all, not him.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.150
Oh.

21:41.825 --> 21:44.931
Where's my happy girl?

21:44.932 --> 21:47.375
Gettin' a stiff neck from
lookin' over my shoulder.

21:47.376 --> 21:48.904
You should drop that.

21:48.905 --> 21:50.688
Layla's just a pale imitation.

21:50.689 --> 21:52.459
At least somebody agrees with me.

21:53.340 --> 21:54.563
Right, well, who doesn't?

21:54.899 --> 21:58.085
The label. Her manager, my manager.

21:58.386 --> 21:59.721
Okay, come here.

22:00.485 --> 22:01.528
Now what are you?

22:03.627 --> 22:05.018
Special.

22:05.019 --> 22:06.287
Right, exactly.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.459
So that means you can do what you want...

22:09.460 --> 22:11.261
- When you want to...
- Hmm.

22:13.730 --> 22:15.614
And for as long as you want.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.523
I've got to go to DC for a meeting.

22:22.524 --> 22:24.704
So I'll see you tomorrow?

22:24.705 --> 22:26.511
I'll be at home in Nashville.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.580
All right. So I'll be there, too.

22:28.581 --> 22:29.636
You can tell me all about

22:29.637 --> 22:32.382
how you dealt with your
annoying little problem.

22:34.052 --> 22:36.054
- Oh, I'll deal
with it. - Mm-hmm.

22:36.755 --> 22:37.195
Mm-hmm.

22:37.724 --> 22:38.759
Next up, ladies and gentlemen...

22:39.392 --> 22:40.803
Maddie Conrad.

22:42.022 --> 22:43.751
Whoo!

22:46.223 --> 22:47.277
Sorry, uh...

22:47.278 --> 22:48.760
I'm really not used to singing alone.

22:48.761 --> 22:50.574
My sister usually does it with me.

22:50.575 --> 22:53.332
The song I'm gonna sing
is not one that I wrote,

22:53.333 --> 22:56.517
but it is very, very important to me.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.781
Would it be okay if I had someone up?

22:59.782 --> 23:01.130
Yeah, no problem.

23:01.131 --> 23:03.649
So this one's called "A Life That's Good."

23:04.715 --> 23:05.950
Deacon?

23:06.714 --> 23:08.646
- What the hell is going
on here? - I-I don't know.

23:08.647 --> 23:10.381
I didn't know anything about it.

23:11.307 --> 23:12.265
That's Deacon Claybourne.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.567
You remember it, right?

23:14.316 --> 23:15.994
I better.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.875
I didn't realize they were that close.

23:17.876 --> 23:19.590
Yeah, neither did I.

- What are you guys playin'?
- There you go.

24:49.992 --> 24:52.335
Just this crazy card
game we play after hours.

24:52.336 --> 24:53.206
You wanna play?

24:53.207 --> 24:55.459
Uh, I'll watch first. I don't know it.

24:55.971 --> 24:57.590
All right. But 7 beats 8, and 9 beats 4.

24:57.591 --> 24:58.983
I can't see what it is. Ah...

24:59.728 --> 25:01.356
I feel like I've hardly
gotten to talk to you.

25:02.351 --> 25:03.344
I really wanna know how
the bluebird's going.

25:04.083 --> 25:05.392
You met any boys?

25:05.714 --> 25:07.513
I mean, sadly, I've been
spending most of my time

25:07.514 --> 25:08.846
with these two lately.

25:08.847 --> 25:10.210
Sadly? I'm offended.

25:10.211 --> 25:11.804
No, she mean... She means "joyously."

25:11.805 --> 25:13.573
<i>- No, I'm pretty sure I meant "sadly."
- Oh.</i>

25:16.182 --> 25:17.156
That's you now.

25:17.157 --> 25:18.482
But... 7, 8, and...

25:24.327 --> 25:25.778
Hey, Deacon!

25:25.779 --> 25:27.753
Oh, hey. Can you tell Maddie I had to run?

25:27.754 --> 25:28.823
What the hell are you doing?

25:28.824 --> 25:29.669
What are you talkin' about?

25:29.670 --> 25:30.776
You think you can just swoop in here

25:30.777 --> 25:32.414
and dazzle her with this music crap?

25:32.415 --> 25:33.331
What happened to you telling me

25:33.332 --> 25:34.879
that you were "never
cut out to be a father,"

25:34.880 --> 25:37.248
- that I was her father, plain and simple?
- You said I had responsibilities, right?

25:37.249 --> 25:38.703
Yeah, not to perform with her publicly.

25:38.704 --> 25:39.638
That wasn't my choice.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.134
Oh, right. Like you had
no influence over that...

25:41.135 --> 25:43.637
She asked me. You were there. You saw it!

25:45.084 --> 25:46.286
Hey, you need to know something.

25:46.287 --> 25:48.053
- What?
- Rayna and I have no interest

25:48.054 --> 25:50.396
- in co-parenting with you, you got
that? - I never said I wanted to co...

25:50.397 --> 25:51.551
And I don't care that you're sober.

25:51.552 --> 25:53.471
- What is your damn problem?
- You know what my problem is?

25:53.472 --> 25:55.490
My problem is that your
ass should still be in jail

25:55.491 --> 25:56.909
for all the damage
you've done to my family.

25:56.910 --> 25:57.762
You wanna talk about damage?

25:57.763 --> 25:59.323
How about marrying your damn mistress

25:59.324 --> 26:00.353
and asking your daughters
to sing at their wedding?

26:00.354 --> 26:01.338
Okay, shut the hell up.

26:01.339 --> 26:03.370
- That's none of your damn business!
- You need to ask yourself

26:03.371 --> 26:04.933
why she's calling me and
not the man who raised her!

26:04.934 --> 26:06.546
- You are not her father!
- Stop it!

26:08.076 --> 26:10.022
Guys! Maddie?

26:21.652 --> 26:23.703
Hey, I've had a great time here tonight.

26:23.704 --> 26:25.998
And I'd like to do one more song for you.

26:25.999 --> 26:27.223
But in order to do it,

26:27.578 --> 26:30.218
I'm gonna need the help of a
very special friend of mine.

26:31.069 --> 26:32.445
You're sittin' this one out.

26:39.935 --> 26:41.562
Juliette Barnes, everyone!

26:43.936 --> 26:45.286
How are y'all doin'?

26:46.083 --> 26:48.389
I just wanted to come up
here on stage and sing a song

26:48.390 --> 26:50.307
with my favorite opening act...

it's nice of Zoey to give us
some time alone. Come here.

28:12.376 --> 28:13.676
What's wrong?

28:14.150 --> 28:15.681
Not you, I just...

28:16.386 --> 28:18.216
I never thought I'd see you guys

28:18.217 --> 28:20.871
all being friends...
Playing cards like that.

28:21.954 --> 28:23.052
It was nice.

28:23.053 --> 28:24.288
It just felt like I was...

28:24.983 --> 28:26.549
Behind glass or something.

28:27.284 --> 28:30.397
Well, we just saw each other
a lot workin' at the bluebird.

28:30.398 --> 28:31.421
Mm.

28:31.726 --> 28:34.400
Don't worry. We all still love you.

28:34.401 --> 28:35.937
I know. It's... it's... It's not that.

28:35.938 --> 28:36.986
Um...

28:39.282 --> 28:41.481
You know the feeling when you're...

28:41.482 --> 28:42.803
In a big room full of people,

28:43.361 --> 28:46.106
but you still feel really alone?

28:46.107 --> 28:47.726
Sure. Of course.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.702
But then you just walk
up and introduce yourself

28:52.350 --> 28:53.481
and make friends.

28:54.279 --> 28:55.573
Listen...

28:55.574 --> 28:56.791
You are the sweetest girl

28:58.283 --> 28:59.608
that I know.

29:03.301 --> 29:04.661
You want to watch some TV?

29:06.528 --> 29:08.057
Sure.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.179
What is your problem
with Deacon Claybourne?

29:12.603 --> 29:13.770
I mean...

29:14.286 --> 29:18.296
What happened today... that...
That goes beyond a bad mood

29:18.297 --> 29:21.201
or... worrying about somebody's influence.

29:23.447 --> 29:24.650
Deacon...

29:27.918 --> 29:30.904
Deacon is Maddie's biological father.

29:31.322 --> 29:32.751
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it.

29:32.752 --> 29:34.873
Just, I don't like talking about it and...

29:35.215 --> 29:36.767
She's Deacon's daughter.

29:36.768 --> 29:39.107
No. She's not, as far as I'm concerned.

29:40.671 --> 29:42.552
He was never there, Peggy...

29:42.553 --> 29:45.145
For the birthdays, the first steps,

29:45.518 --> 29:48.337
the skinned knees, the
fevers, the highs and lows...

29:48.338 --> 29:49.721
None of it.

29:49.722 --> 29:51.490
But I was there. Me.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.473
- I have rights.
- Yes.

29:54.474 --> 29:55.474
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

29:55.475 --> 29:57.658
Right. Whether he likes it or not, too.

29:57.659 --> 29:59.008
I've been playin' real good,

29:59.009 --> 30:00.475
I've been staying in
my lane and everything.

30:00.476 --> 30:02.065
But if he's gonna pull crap like this...

30:03.315 --> 30:05.643
- There's steps I can take, aren't there?
- Yes.

30:05.644 --> 30:07.835
You can go to court,
establish legal paternity.

30:07.836 --> 30:10.068
I'm not trying to get
custody, nothin' like that.

30:10.069 --> 30:11.845
I'm not tryin' to be some other parent.

30:11.846 --> 30:13.684
I just... if Maddie wants things from me,

30:13.685 --> 30:15.077
I want her to be able
to get 'em, all right?

30:15.078 --> 30:16.347
If she wants to see me...

30:17.135 --> 30:18.348
He sure as hell ain't gonna stop it.

30:18.986 --> 30:20.098
Look...

30:20.099 --> 30:21.277
I know that you're pissed at Teddy,

30:21.278 --> 30:22.458
- and you have every right to be.
- Yeah.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.489
You have to understand what it
is you're talking about here.

30:26.070 --> 30:29.325
Are you ready to be a
permanent part of Maddie's life?

30:33.130 --> 30:34.790
This was supposed to be a great day.

30:35.199 --> 30:36.565
Instead it was awful.

30:37.398 --> 30:38.726
I'm sorry.

30:39.467 --> 30:41.191
And you sang so beautifully.

30:41.515 --> 30:42.878
That doesn't even matter anymore.

30:46.907 --> 30:48.085
When I'm with Deacon,

30:48.532 --> 30:49.993
dad gets so upset.

30:50.749 --> 30:52.042
When I'm with dad,

30:52.346 --> 30:55.317
well, obviously, Deacon hates him. So...

30:55.318 --> 30:57.188
- I don't think it's about hate.
- Well, I hate it...

30:58.387 --> 30:59.686
All of it.

30:59.687 --> 31:02.319
Maybe I just shouldn't
see either of them anymore.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.040
I think that'd be a real shame.

31:05.360 --> 31:07.053
They both do love you so much.

31:07.952 --> 31:09.496
And if they loved me...

31:10.157 --> 31:11.961
They would not act that way.

31:11.962 --> 31:14.013
Well, funny thing about people is...

31:14.014 --> 31:15.410
They make a lot of mistakes...

31:16.288 --> 31:18.872
That can end up hurting
the people around 'em.

31:18.873 --> 31:20.869
And what I've grown to realize is

31:20.870 --> 31:22.826
it doesn't mean they love you any less.

31:22.827 --> 31:24.519
It really doesn't feel that way.

31:34.748 --> 31:36.761
Hey, I've been on a treadmill for an hour,

31:36.762 --> 31:40.113
and what it comes down to
is if we really are a thing,

31:40.114 --> 31:41.597
we have to tell Scarlett.

31:41.598 --> 31:43.252
Yeah, I've been thinking the same thing.

31:43.253 --> 31:45.887
She's my best friend. I feel sick.

31:45.888 --> 31:47.556
So how do we do it...

31:47.557 --> 31:50.661
- Together?
- No, I think I have to do it by myself.

31:50.662 --> 31:52.201
Trust me, it'll be better that way.

31:52.781 --> 31:54.251
You gonna do it now?

31:54.988 --> 31:57.158
- Yeah.
-  Okay.

31:58.367 --> 31:59.517
Now it is.

32:11.189 --> 32:12.956
<i>And that is how it's done.</i>

32:18.023 --> 32:19.159
What?

32:20.013 --> 32:21.554
Oh, come on. She started it.

32:30.254 --> 32:32.001
I had no idea that was
gonna happen, all right?

32:32.002 --> 32:33.261
I thought Layla was coming out there,

32:33.262 --> 32:34.833
- and I...
- I know. Imagine it's tough

32:34.834 --> 32:38.036
to juggle a diva and a diva in training.

32:40.023 --> 32:41.367
Damn near impossible.

32:43.438 --> 32:45.187
You know, I never know which
version of you I'm gonna get.

32:46.317 --> 32:48.008
You're all business, or you're...

32:48.646 --> 32:50.468
A sympathetic friend.

32:50.469 --> 32:51.699
I'm both.

32:54.390 --> 32:56.304
I'm-a go see how my girlfriend's doing.

33:05.296 --> 33:06.797
Hey.

33:07.242 --> 33:09.357
Did you just work out for two hours?

33:09.358 --> 33:11.668
I was just thinking through some stuff.

33:12.502 --> 33:14.579
Maybe I should try that. It might help.

33:16.103 --> 33:18.651
- With what?
- I feel so awkward on this tour.

33:19.224 --> 33:21.054
Gunnar's making friends
with everything that moves,

33:21.055 --> 33:23.748
and I'm, like, this
stranger everywhere we stop,

33:23.749 --> 33:25.167
everywhere we go.

33:25.638 --> 33:27.122
And now you're all here...

33:27.629 --> 33:29.960
You don't feel like you
belong with us either?

33:29.961 --> 33:31.186
I don't know.

33:32.381 --> 33:34.808
I get it. I mean, that's exactly how I felt

33:34.809 --> 33:36.477
when I first moved to Nashville.

33:36.478 --> 33:38.116
It didn't matter how
nice you all were to me,

33:38.117 --> 33:40.027
I still felt like I was alone.

33:41.563 --> 33:42.575
You're just on your own

33:42.576 --> 33:43.971
for the first time in your life.

33:45.367 --> 33:47.174
Have you been crying
yourself to sleep ever night

33:47.175 --> 33:48.651
and not telling anyone?

33:49.875 --> 33:52.517
I did that for, like, three weeks,

33:52.518 --> 33:54.878
- even with you sleeping on the sofa.
- Oh.

33:55.783 --> 33:58.394
But I promise, it's gonna get better.

34:01.683 --> 34:03.429
Thank you.

34:04.254 --> 34:05.907
I'm so glad you're my friend.

34:06.337 --> 34:07.974
I don't know what I'd do without you.

34:17.953 --> 34:19.469
What, are you gonna shun me, too?

34:19.469 --> 34:22.109
I just made your career
tonight, okay, kiddo?

34:22.110 --> 34:25.748
Hey, I've learned it's best not
to piss off a powerful woman.

34:26.487 --> 34:28.393
And certainly not two of 'em.

34:28.801 --> 34:30.373
What does everybody see in her?

34:31.116 --> 34:34.005
<i>Everyone just thinks she is so perfect</i>

34:35.039 --> 34:37.349
- and... sweet.
- Manipulative.

34:37.350 --> 34:38.699
Yes.

34:39.346 --> 34:41.159
What are you doing with her?

34:41.161 --> 34:43.011
I mean, with your whole laid-back,

34:43.012 --> 34:45.659
aw-shucks cowboy thing, I figured you had

34:45.661 --> 34:47.864
a line of girls after every show.

34:48.534 --> 34:50.270
But they probably wouldn't help you

34:50.271 --> 34:52.228
trend on Twitter, now would they?

34:52.596 --> 34:54.231
You think that's what I want...

34:54.989 --> 34:58.590
Some stupid #laylanwill hashtag?

34:58.591 --> 35:00.390
I want to kill it as a country singer.

35:00.876 --> 35:02.517
If she helps me get there...

35:02.518 --> 35:05.283
You don't even like her.

35:06.503 --> 35:08.136
Well, maybe someday...

35:09.157 --> 35:10.792
If I'm lucky...

35:10.793 --> 35:12.188
You know, I'll... I'll find someone

35:12.189 --> 35:14.439
who makes me feel like
the best version of myself.

35:18.331 --> 35:20.382
The best version of yourself, huh?

35:22.089 --> 35:23.734
He's a man of high moral standards,

35:24.182 --> 35:26.085
and I stand by him fully.

35:27.082 --> 35:29.005
Thank you. You may step down.

35:31.281 --> 35:32.653
Are there any other witnesses

35:32.654 --> 35:34.592
the defense would like to submit?

35:34.593 --> 35:36.912
We were hoping for one more, your honor.

35:36.913 --> 35:39.488
- If we could have a few minutes...
- I have a very tight docket, counsel.

35:39.489 --> 35:40.783
We can't wait on anyone.

35:41.724 --> 35:45.209
- So after considering all these factors...
- I'm here...

35:45.210 --> 35:46.650
Your honor.

35:48.141 --> 35:50.941
I can't speak to my
father's business dealings

35:50.942 --> 35:53.507
or to his reputation in
the financial community,

35:53.817 --> 35:55.649
but I do think I can speak to the issue

35:55.650 --> 35:57.361
of whether or not he's a flight risk.

35:57.362 --> 35:58.710
He is not.

35:58.711 --> 36:01.444
My father values his
family more than anything,

36:01.445 --> 36:03.616
and I know he wants to
be home to be with us.

36:05.556 --> 36:07.767
He wouldn't do anything to compromise that.

36:07.768 --> 36:09.604
Now my father and I
have disagreed over a lot

36:09.605 --> 36:11.006
over the years, but...

36:13.036 --> 36:14.634
I've never doubted his commitment to family

36:15.084 --> 36:18.139
- and to the city.
- Thank you. You may step down.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.142
Okay.

36:22.780 --> 36:24.231
After considering all the factors,

36:25.112 --> 36:27.590
the court denies the
defendant's application

36:27.591 --> 36:29.227
for house arrest.

36:29.228 --> 36:30.752
The defendant is remanded to the custody

36:30.753 --> 36:32.009
of the federal penitentiary.

36:33.082 --> 36:34.822
Next case.

36:53.521 --> 36:56.371
<i>Hey, it's Avery. Leave a message.</i>

36:56.372 --> 37:00.790
<i>Hey, Avery, it's me. Uh, I was just calling</i>

37:00.791 --> 37:02.226
because...

37:04.135 --> 37:06.582
I am coming back to Nashville

37:07.727 --> 37:10.408
for the music festival, and, uh...

37:10.710 --> 37:12.534
Wanted to see if you were gonna be around.

37:13.233 --> 37:14.840
So give me a call.

37:25.344 --> 37:26.494
Hey.

37:26.495 --> 37:28.508
This is for you... For the road.

37:28.509 --> 37:29.645
Thank you.

37:30.523 --> 37:33.011
Listen, Scarlett, I'm sorry you're feeling

37:33.012 --> 37:34.683
like things aren't great out here.

37:35.300 --> 37:37.941
And if I wasn't being helpful...

37:37.942 --> 37:39.406
I wasn't very articulate.

37:42.054 --> 37:43.715
Thank you for comin' here to see me.

37:44.801 --> 37:46.166
Hey, where's Zoey? We gotta get going.

37:46.167 --> 37:48.948
You know what? She always takes forever.

37:48.949 --> 37:50.872
I'll go get her for you. Hold on.

38:04.795 --> 38:06.196
I appreciate y'all coming.

38:06.197 --> 38:07.270
How's Maddie doing?

38:07.271 --> 38:10.397
It wasn't great for her to
see y'all like that, fighting.

38:10.398 --> 38:12.097
I wasn't fighting. I was
minding my own business.

38:12.098 --> 38:13.411
Minding your own business, when you show up

38:13.412 --> 38:15.717
- at our daughter's event?
- Yeah, our daughter. That's right.

38:15.718 --> 38:17.387
- See, I'm a part of this...
- Hey, hey, hey!

38:18.199 --> 38:19.962
She said to me that she
thinks it might be a good idea

38:19.963 --> 38:21.102
for her not to have a relationship

38:21.103 --> 38:22.666
with either one of you.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.210
And I think that would
not only be a mistake,

38:24.211 --> 38:25.843
<i>that would be a loss.</i>

38:25.844 --> 38:27.939
I spent my whole life
estranged from my father.

38:30.608 --> 38:32.381
Not gonna let that happen to her.

38:32.838 --> 38:34.298
And I don't know how we do it,

38:34.621 --> 38:37.446
but I know she loves you,
Teddy, and she loves you, Deacon.

38:39.015 --> 38:40.246
Don't give her a reason to shut out

38:40.247 --> 38:42.530
the two most important men in her life.

38:51.149 --> 38:52.237
Hey.

38:54.441 --> 38:55.437
You miss me?

38:57.275 --> 38:58.802
We have to talk.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.382
I'm sorry.

39:14.891 --> 39:16.352
It was pretty awful.

39:18.094 --> 39:19.383
Yeah.

39:20.334 --> 39:22.425
I don't think the judge
would have agreed to it,

39:22.426 --> 39:23.867
even if I had appeared.

39:23.868 --> 39:25.409
What the hell happened
between you and daddy,

39:25.410 --> 39:27.344
'cause y'all used to be thick as thieves,

39:27.345 --> 39:29.195
and now you're not.

39:29.196 --> 39:30.679
I realized that I didn't know him

39:30.680 --> 39:32.273
as well as I thought I did.

39:33.098 --> 39:35.581
I just need to keep my distance from him

39:35.582 --> 39:37.205
for a little while.

39:40.972 --> 39:42.418
Good night.

39:46.322 --> 39:48.171
<i>It's in proverbs... Isn't it, Albert...</i>

39:48.172 --> 39:49.744
Where it says that, uh...

39:50.912 --> 39:55.503
"Anyone who lives without
blame walks safely"?

39:57.550 --> 39:59.605
And those who are to blame...

40:02.587 --> 40:04.860
I'd imagine, they'd best be careful.

40:05.279 --> 40:07.399
Hi, Tessa. It's mayor Conrad.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.861
I need you to do me a favor.

40:09.351 --> 40:12.687
Pull Deacon Claybourne's name
from the list of performers.

40:12.688 --> 40:14.838
Yeah, unfortunately, he's
not gonna be able to make it.

40:15.396 --> 40:16.843
Okay, thank you.

40:23.213 --> 40:25.361
The night of your anniversary party,

40:25.362 --> 40:27.263
I watched you and Olivia.

40:27.264 --> 40:28.664
And you would always put your hand

40:28.665 --> 40:29.879
on the small of her back,

40:29.880 --> 40:32.227
and she would smile at you when you did.

40:32.228 --> 40:33.809
That was just keeping up
appearances, wasn't it?

40:33.810 --> 40:35.361
Let me finish.

40:35.362 --> 40:37.983
Look, I would be lying if I said that...

40:39.141 --> 40:42.593
I didn't wish that I could
trade places with her that night.

40:43.743 --> 40:45.552
But then you kissed me, and...

40:46.567 --> 40:48.751
It didn't mean anything...

40:49.881 --> 40:51.766
Until you didn't let up.

40:51.767 --> 40:53.728
- Because I love you.
- No, that's the thing.

40:53.729 --> 40:56.118
<i>You don't love me. You don't.</i>

40:56.742 --> 40:58.547
You like the challenge of me,

40:59.536 --> 41:01.176
the rush, but...

41:02.511 --> 41:06.006
Love is... wanting to help somebody

41:06.007 --> 41:08.097
be the best version of themselves.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.369
And I don't do that for you.

41:13.651 --> 41:15.433
Wow.

41:15.434 --> 41:17.533
Get back together with Olivia.

41:18.225 --> 41:20.510
She'll forgive you. She'll take you back,

41:20.511 --> 41:23.016
and it'll be like none
of this ever happened.

41:24.004 --> 41:27.272
Well, if that's the way you want it.

41:27.753 --> 41:30.159
We should just be glad
that we figured this out

41:30.160 --> 41:32.081
before we told the world about it.

41:33.406 --> 41:34.820
Yep.

41:41.819 --> 41:43.734
Thanks for letting me stay here.

41:43.735 --> 41:46.686
So sick of hotels and room service.

41:46.687 --> 41:49.352
Yeah, well, you're in luck.

41:49.353 --> 41:51.541
We offer very little
in the way of food here.

42:06.105 --> 42:07.675
Hey, what do you think of Juliette?

42:09.218 --> 42:11.263
I think she's all right.

42:11.264 --> 42:12.775
Well, I think she's a bitch.

42:13.456 --> 42:15.139
I'm-a take a shower.

42:29.448 --> 42:31.138
- Tmz?
- Hello?

42:31.139 --> 42:32.496
Hi. Yeah, you got a tip?

42:32.497 --> 42:33.805
Yes, hi.

42:33.806 --> 42:35.433
You don't know me, but
I have some information

42:35.434 --> 42:37.373
that I think you might find useful.

42:38.291 --> 42:39.353
Well, would you like to know

42:39.354 --> 42:41.763
why Charlie and Olivia Wentworth split up?

42:42.339 --> 42:43.432
Two words...

42:44.339 --> 42:45.946
Juliette Barnes.
