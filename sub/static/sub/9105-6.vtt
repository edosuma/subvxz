WEBVTT

00:07.257 --> 00:09.259
Didn't know him, never met
him, didn't kill him.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.554
<i>Can you tell me how your
T-shirt got covered in blood?</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:13.097
My little boy was sick.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.640
<i>Something terrible
happened to him.</i>

00:14.806 --> 00:16.399
Sweetie, it's all right, calm down.
<i>Frostbite ?</i>

00:16.558 --> 00:18.777
<i>In the little boy's bedroom.</i>

00:18.936 --> 00:20.609
Covered in blood.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.900
<i>I found it in
Stoddart's study, but the scan</i>

00:24.066 --> 00:25.659
<i>has Pettigrew's name on it.</i>

00:25.817 --> 00:28.036
When I asked you if he
had stayed at that hotel,

00:28.195 --> 00:29.572
you blushed, like
you're doing right now.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.331
You knew him, though.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.083
Pettigrew's
the reason he's here.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.585
The little boy
was there

00:34.743 --> 00:36.711
when Charlie Stoddart
was murdered.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.292
He was right there.

Oh, Doctor, I...

05:04.554 --> 05:06.556
You know, years ago...

05:06.723 --> 05:09.067
my mother used to say to
me, she'd say, Quiet.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.604
“In this world, Elwood,
you must be"--

05:11.770 --> 05:13.443
she always called
me Elwood--

05:13.605 --> 05:15.152
"In this world,
Elwood,

05:15.315 --> 05:18.285
you
must be oh, so smart..."

05:22.614 --> 05:25.163
...I recommend pleasant.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.293
Quiet. And you may quote me.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.927
Lao, stay there.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.434
What's your name?

05:50.976 --> 05:53.479
Sit there.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.780
Here you go.
ls that better?

05:58.942 --> 06:01.195
What's all this?

06:01.361 --> 06:04.080
Have you not
been well?

06:04.239 --> 06:06.537
Oh, you're
absolutely freezing.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.628
Will you tell me your name?

06:12.289 --> 06:14.508
What were you doing
out there in the cold?

06:17.377 --> 06:19.926
Oh, your feet.

06:21.590 --> 06:22.887
Dear me.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.019
Your feet are stone cold.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.080
Doggy.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.280
Mr. Sutter?

07:19.564 --> 07:20.907
Hi...

07:21.066 --> 07:22.943
Mr...?
Husekleppe.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.611
Yeah.
Yeah. We have met.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.030
Parents evening.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.322
You were there--

07:27.489 --> 07:29.332
in spirit
if not in person.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.289
I'm Liam's
teacher. Eh?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.499
Yeah, I know who you are.
Mm-hmm.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.256
He's a very bright boy.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.007
Yeah.
Yeah.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.509
Very talkative.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.511
Friendly.
Helpful.

07:41.670 --> 07:42.887
Yeah.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.470
Takes after his mother,

07:46.633 --> 07:47.976
I guess.
Probably.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.681
Uh-huh.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.687
I need to get on home.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.269
I hear he has the mumps.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.309
That's right, yeah.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.400
I need to...

07:59.562 --> 08:00.939
Yeah.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.509
Hey.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.518
Okay, you're bleeding.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.554
Where are you
bleeding from?

08:34.389 --> 08:36.390
Liam, tell me what happened.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.066
Liam, are you hurt?

08:42.772 --> 08:43.773
Liam...

08:43.940 --> 08:46.238
what has happened to you?

08:46.401 --> 08:47.994
Liam, are you hurt?

08:48.153 --> 08:50.451
Son, tell me
what happened.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.660
Are you hurt?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.664
I don't understand.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.168
Where is the
bleeding?

09:04.669 --> 09:06.717
It's okay.
It's okay, Liam.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.598
It's okay.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.721
I can't find anything.
I can't...

09:14.888 --> 09:17.141
can't understand.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.279
I threw up.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.699
Oh, it's okay, son.

09:39.871 --> 09:43.296
Where's Mum?

09:43.458 --> 09:46.052
She's, um...

09:46.211 --> 09:48.760
she'll be home in a minute.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.313
Door open, Dad.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.565
Yeah.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.570
Petra...

10:49.732 --> 10:52.906
can you hold
this for me...

10:53.069 --> 10:54.992
right up there
like that?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.702
Just like that?

10:56.865 --> 10:59.539
Okay, so the potato
peeler is used first.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.045
And that's these
superficial wounds here.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.500
That's why there's not

11:03.663 --> 11:06.212
a great amount
of blood.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.797
And the stabbing arc
is quite short.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.430
Then he picks up a knife
and he slashes,

11:12.589 --> 11:14.307
closer, downward.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.591
Like this.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.227
And finally, a cleaver.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.639
And that's what causes
the blood to spray.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.057
Right.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.021
Which is consistent
with the assailant

11:24.184 --> 11:26.107
sitting astride the man...

11:26.269 --> 11:27.816
and hacking...

11:27.979 --> 11:29.572
downwards and...

11:32.066 --> 11:33.864
What?

11:34.027 --> 11:35.199
I don't know.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.705
I can see something
strange, I think.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.918
There's something inside him,

11:42.076 --> 11:44.670
something tiny.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.093
What do you see?

11:50.251 --> 11:51.503
A foreign object.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.888
A fragment--
stuck to the lower left rib.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.890
The underside
of the rib.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.268
Can't see it.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.059
Would you pull it out, please?

12:12.899 --> 12:15.823
At first I thought
it was a bone fragment, but...

12:20.615 --> 12:23.585
It's a fingernail.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.289
From a child?

12:30.833 --> 12:33.712
Hyperbaric oxygen treatment
can help damaged cells recover.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.506
Any tissue in Liam's feet

12:36.673 --> 12:40.348
that can be saved will be
as long as he is in there.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.433
And what happens
if we wake him up?

12:42.595 --> 12:44.768
Just long enough
to speak to him?

12:44.931 --> 12:48.356
When he becomes fully
conscious, the pain will be

12:48.518 --> 12:50.612
unbearable.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.568
Well, then,
that's not an option.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.903
We could leave the child alone

12:55.066 --> 12:56.784
and learn nothing,

12:56.943 --> 12:59.822
or we can wake him up,
and we get some answers.

12:59.988 --> 13:03.367
I think we have
to wake him up.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.538
Yes.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.924
But not before
I talk to the mother.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.550
No. No!

13:12.709 --> 13:14.803
No.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.213
You listen to me.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.801
Someone must have
put that there.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.261
That is not him.

13:19.424 --> 13:20.471
I'm sorry, Jules.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.555
No!

13:25.555 --> 13:27.353
Don't touch me.
Come on.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.142
You-you get off me!

13:29.309 --> 13:32.529
Somebody’s
done this to him.

13:32.687 --> 13:35.440
Jules, look at me.

13:39.569 --> 13:42.413
Liam's going
to be okay.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.325
I won't let any harm
come to your son.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.711
You promised me that before.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.713
We have to wake him.

13:50.872 --> 13:53.000
No. Fuck you!

13:53.166 --> 13:54.509
Leave him alone!

13:54.667 --> 13:57.090
Fuck you!
Leave him alone!

13:57.253 --> 13:59.347
You leave him alone, Dan!

14:22.278 --> 14:24.201
Hey, sweetie.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.617
It's Mummy.

14:26.783 --> 14:29.036
Mummy's here.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.169
Are you awake?

14:35.291 --> 14:36.918
Liam?

14:37.085 --> 14:40.259
Rapid low-voltage EEG.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.423
He's beginning to wake now.

14:42.590 --> 14:46.811
I'm going to up his painkiller
by five mill.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.768
Liam, can you hear me?

14:51.099 --> 14:53.318
Mum?

14:53.476 --> 14:56.400
Hey. It's okay, sweetheart.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.486
You're safe, and the
doctor's looking after you.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.367
I want you to
talk to somebody,

15:01.526 --> 15:03.449
Okay?

15:03.611 --> 15:05.864
Answer the questions.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.503
Liam?

15:16.666 --> 15:20.387
How are you feeling?

15:20.545 --> 15:22.764
So, I'm gonna ask
you some questions.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.050
You think you
can follow me?

15:28.302 --> 15:29.770
Liam? I think he's drifting.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.306
Give it a moment.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.520
Be quick please.
I will. I will.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.777
Liam,

15:35.935 --> 15:38.484
were you with someone
that night?

15:41.482 --> 15:43.735
No.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.448
No?

15:45.611 --> 15:47.454
How did you get across town?

15:47.613 --> 15:49.411
Walk.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.076
Alone?

15:51.242 --> 15:52.243
Please.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.787
Okay.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.583
Yes.

15:57.748 --> 16:00.592
Liam, can you remember what
happened in the kitchen?

16:02.670 --> 16:06.766
Onions.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.311
And do you remember...?

16:10.470 --> 16:14.600
Doggy.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.856
Feet hurt.

16:21.022 --> 16:22.945
Thwack!

16:25.485 --> 16:26.953
They're all wet!

16:27.111 --> 16:29.034
Thwack!

16:29.197 --> 16:31.541
Stop this.
My feet, Mum.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.542
MY feet!

16:33.701 --> 16:35.829
My feet are burning!

16:35.995 --> 16:37.542
You have to stop
this now!

16:37.705 --> 16:38.831
Wait. My hands!

16:38.998 --> 16:39.794
Wait. Wait.

16:39.957 --> 16:40.833
Thwack!

16:41.000 --> 16:42.092
Liam?

16:42.251 --> 16:43.127
Liam, what happened?

16:43.294 --> 16:44.637
My hands!

16:46.631 --> 16:48.008
My hands!

16:48.174 --> 16:50.393
I put my hands inside the man!

16:59.143 --> 17:01.111
Uh, let me out!

17:01.270 --> 17:02.066
Margaret?
Let me out!

17:02.230 --> 17:03.152
Enough.
Let me out.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.406
Uh, let me out!

17:04.565 --> 17:05.691
All right, put him back.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.280
Let me out!
Let me out!

17:07.443 --> 17:08.444
- Mum!
- What's happening?

17:08.611 --> 17:10.329
Do something.
My feet are burning!

17:10.488 --> 17:12.707
What's happening?!
Let me out!

17:12.865 --> 17:15.993
Help! Let me! Please. For God's
sake, get him out of there!

17:16.160 --> 17:17.752
Let me out!

17:17.912 --> 17:19.914
My feet are burning!

17:20.080 --> 17:20.957
They're burning.

17:21.123 --> 17:24.002
Let me out!

17:24.167 --> 17:27.342
Let me out!
Let me out!

17:27.505 --> 17:29.007
Let me out.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.640
He's stable.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.023
It's all right, sweetie.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.479
I'm here.

17:42.645 --> 17:45.899
I'm here.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.568
<i>I'm here.</i>

17:51.445 --> 17:53.914
How can she ever...

17:54.073 --> 17:56.326
cope with this?

17:56.492 --> 17:58.244
She can't.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.709
Charlie must have...

18:03.291 --> 18:06.170
He must have brought him in
from the cold, and then...

18:10.089 --> 18:12.387
Poor Charlie.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.712
Dad?

18:49.879 --> 18:51.552
What?

18:52.923 --> 18:54.766
I'm very tired.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.019
I know... pet.

18:57.178 --> 18:58.930
Here. Come here.
Give me a hand.

19:00.765 --> 19:03.564
I can't get me big fat fingers
in here. Look.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.771
Look.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.439
You see these?
See these two wires?

19:08.606 --> 19:10.199
Uh-huh. The black
and the red one.

19:10.358 --> 19:12.611
Yup. I want you to touch
them together for me.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.324
Why?

19:14.487 --> 19:16.535
'Cause it'll make the
engine start. Come on.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.119
Can't you do it?

19:18.282 --> 19:19.750
No. I can't, pet.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.128
Because you've hurt your hand?

19:22.286 --> 19:24.084
No. I haven't.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.715
You have. I know you have. Carrie,
will you do as I tell you?

19:26.874 --> 19:28.501
Touch the two wires
together, please.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.011
No.
Carrie!

19:30.169 --> 19:32.968
No! You'll do as
you're fucking told!

19:33.130 --> 19:36.600
Do as you're fucking told,
touch the wires together,

19:36.759 --> 19:39.228
and we'll get out
of here. Please.

19:39.387 --> 19:42.937
No,Dad, I
don't want to anymore.

19:43.099 --> 19:46.649
I want to go home.

19:46.811 --> 19:49.234
I want to go back to school.

19:49.397 --> 19:52.401
I want to see Liam.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.989
I'm only ten, Dad.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.950
I'm only ten.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.660
I want my mum.

19:58.823 --> 20:01.121
Oh, my baby, come here. Here.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.377
You're my baby.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.163
I'm sorry.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.545
I am so sorry.

20:11.794 --> 20:15.094
Oh, Carrie,
I'm so sorry.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.099
Everything I've done,
I'm so sorry.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.510
I'm sorry.

20:18.676 --> 20:21.930
You're my baby.
I love you.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.106
I'm sorry.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.026
I'm really sorry.
I love you.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.125
I'm sorry.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.880
I'm sorry.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.427
Please.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.947
Come.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.594
Your leg still hurts?

21:35.753 --> 21:38.006
Yeah, a little bit.

21:38.172 --> 21:40.391
Listen, Trish.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.641
We have the murderer for sure.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.148
Sutter.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.229
The search
and rescue guy?

21:49.391 --> 21:51.189
No, not him.

21:51.352 --> 21:53.571
His son.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.151
His son?

21:55.314 --> 21:57.066
Yes, his little boy-- he did it.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.402
Little boy?

22:00.569 --> 22:02.446
Yes, he's ten years old.
He did it.

22:02.613 --> 22:04.490
A ten-year-old child?

22:04.657 --> 22:06.159
Yes.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.248
A child killed Charlie?
Yes, Trish.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.162
That's what
you're telling me now?!

22:21.632 --> 22:24.306
How do a mum and dad cope
with a thing like that?

22:24.468 --> 22:27.142
I don't know. I mean, how
does a little boy have...?

22:27.304 --> 22:28.305
Sorry, Markus.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.060
Have does he even
have the strength?

22:32.226 --> 22:35.196
Well, from experience,
I'll tell you.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.528
Children can be
surprisingly strong.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.864
A ten-year-old boy
having a tantrum...

22:41.026 --> 22:42.448
Tantrum?

22:42.611 --> 22:46.036
Well... struggling, you know.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.039
Hello, Henry.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.955
Morning, Shirley. Madness
has its own strength.

22:53.122 --> 22:55.750
There's an offer on
the Blue Swan vodka this week.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.088
I don't want it.

22:57.251 --> 22:58.377
Sorry. So,

22:58.544 --> 22:59.796
this child.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.305
Ten years old.

23:01.463 --> 23:02.840
It's a boy I know well.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.475
What about him?

23:04.633 --> 23:07.933
Well, it transpires
is the killer.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.063
I don't know.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.565
You run out of words,

23:11.724 --> 23:12.976
out of thoughts.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.940
What child?
I know.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.946
Beyond human
understanding, but

23:18.105 --> 23:19.357
that is what happened.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.867
Liam Sutter, ten years old.

23:22.026 --> 23:23.824
Hacked a grown man to death.

23:26.447 --> 23:29.667
I try to teach them that
life is a precious thing.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.874
A gift.

23:33.037 --> 23:34.254
Oh, hey.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.665
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

23:35.831 --> 23:37.959
Hey, what are you saying
about Liam Sutter?!

23:39.335 --> 23:42.509
What's he saying?!

24:02.650 --> 24:04.948
Frank.

24:09.740 --> 24:12.994
I understand that you were
telling me the truth

24:13.160 --> 24:15.413
about where the blood came from.

24:18.082 --> 24:20.756
We found corroborating evidence.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.641
Liam lost a fingernail,

24:27.800 --> 24:30.394
and it was

24:30.552 --> 24:32.850
inside Stoddart's body.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.522
Liam told us
what he did.

24:37.685 --> 24:39.858
He told us all
in front of his mother.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.317
Stop it.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.653
I am more sorry
than I know how to say.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.409
Frank.
Then stop it. Stop talking.

24:45.567 --> 24:46.864
You know...

24:47.027 --> 24:49.325
You know this
is all shit.

24:54.576 --> 24:56.874
Open this.

25:23.147 --> 25:26.321
Julia. I heard about your son.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.326
I'm s-so sorry.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.362
Is there anything
I can do to help?

25:32.406 --> 25:35.159
Take this.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.202
Can I help you?

25:39.163 --> 25:40.506
A drink.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.211
What?

25:42.374 --> 25:44.297
Have you got a drink?
A drink.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.259
Here.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.985
I've lost him.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.971
♪♪

27:02.830 --> 27:04.707
Jules.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.502
Jules.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.484
Questions of motive
don't even enter into it, do they?

27:31.650 --> 27:33.527
No, no.

27:33.694 --> 27:36.868
This is a profound psychosis.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.498
I mean, he takes
the chopping block

27:38.657 --> 27:40.910
and he smashes it down
on Stoddart's head.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.419
And then hacking

27:42.578 --> 27:45.206
and-and stabbing and...

27:45.372 --> 27:47.215
Relentless.

27:47.374 --> 27:50.878
I mean, I-inhuman savagery.

27:51.044 --> 27:52.887
From a ten-year-old kid.

27:53.046 --> 27:56.050
Where does that come from?
I mean, w-where?

27:56.216 --> 27:58.594
Well, this is not something
we're qualified to answer, Gene.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.979
I guess not.

28:01.138 --> 28:03.015
Okay.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.527
Pettigrew.

28:06.685 --> 28:07.777
Yeah, Pettigrew.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.404
They took the GPR scan

28:09.563 --> 28:11.531
but they left the folder.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.692
And on the folder
is written "Max 2.5."

28:13.859 --> 28:15.202
Yup.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.203
Nobody in technical
resources has

28:17.362 --> 28:20.081
any idea what has
a maximum value of 2.5.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.501
It's a name.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.003
Somebody's name

28:25.162 --> 28:27.836
in the research center.
That's what it is.

28:27.998 --> 28:29.875
Excellent.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.715
Are you okay?

28:32.878 --> 28:34.380
Yeah.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.890
You do know they put you
in the dead man's room?

28:37.049 --> 28:38.722
So?

28:38.884 --> 28:40.227
I was just thinking--

28:40.385 --> 28:42.934
get some candles,
close the curtains,

28:43.096 --> 28:44.939
have yourself a little séance.

28:45.098 --> 28:46.566
And ask Pettigrew

28:46.725 --> 28:49.194
what the fuck it was he found
before they killed him.

28:49.353 --> 28:51.230
Good-bye.

29:23.971 --> 29:25.848
Sheriff.

29:28.058 --> 29:30.481
Elena.

29:31.937 --> 29:34.440
You attacked Frank.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.485
No, no, I was trying to protect...
No, shut up.

29:37.651 --> 29:40.951
Shut up.
You attacked him.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.366
I'm brought in.
Questioned.

29:43.532 --> 29:45.876
I'm asked
about Pettigrew.

29:46.034 --> 29:47.911
Stop. Stop.
Just stop.

29:50.372 --> 29:52.921
I just came to say
one thing to you.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.927
Stay the fuck away from me.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.975
Forget it.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.808
You're bad.
You're a bad sheriff.

30:19.818 --> 30:23.197
Feed a fever, starve a cold. Mm?

30:23.363 --> 30:24.785
Mm.

30:24.948 --> 30:26.621
When I was a boy,

30:26.783 --> 30:30.538
my mother used to make
this soup for me, Shirley.

30:30.704 --> 30:32.957
Cream of chicken broth

30:33.123 --> 30:35.467
with little herb dumplings.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.181
I used to enjoy being ill.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.217
Just for the soup.

30:47.888 --> 30:49.731
Mmm.

30:49.890 --> 30:52.734
Utterly delicious.

30:52.893 --> 30:54.770
Sit up, honey.

30:59.149 --> 31:01.026
Sit up, please.

31:02.486 --> 31:04.909
Shirley?

31:06.531 --> 31:08.579
No, thank you.

31:08.742 --> 31:10.619
Markus, I can't.

31:17.417 --> 31:20.546
Well, we're gonna
have to do something

31:20.712 --> 31:23.591
before you fade away
to nothing at all.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.983
Yup?

31:42.150 --> 31:44.278
Is this room 2.5?

31:44.444 --> 31:46.287
Uh-huh.

31:46.446 --> 31:47.993
Max. Hey.

31:50.784 --> 31:53.287
You lost this.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.586
That's... That's not mine.
Look,

31:56.748 --> 31:59.467
before you go down
this sort of hopeless road of

31:59.626 --> 32:01.128
self-incrimination,
I should tell you

32:01.294 --> 32:03.012
that Pettigrew
made the scan

32:03.171 --> 32:04.764
that was in this folder.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.346
Now the scan is gone
and Pettigrew is dead

32:07.509 --> 32:09.807
and I think you know
who took it.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.724
And I would suggest
you tell me

32:13.890 --> 32:15.733
or you're probably
gonna wind up dead, too.

32:29.906 --> 32:31.749
Yuri Lubimov.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.832
Who is he and what does he do?

32:34.995 --> 32:38.295
He's the head of security
at the Russian mining town.

32:38.457 --> 32:41.051
Vukobejina.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.507
He left to go back there today.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.594
And are you frightened
of Mr. Lubimov?

32:50.594 --> 32:52.437
Yes, I am.

32:52.596 --> 32:55.440
I'll take care of him.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.476
Thank you, Max.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.745
You see, Tavrani, I think
all this tourist tat

33:08.904 --> 33:11.908
is a smoke screen
for what you really are.

33:12.073 --> 33:14.701
And what is it that I really am
in your eyes, my friend?

33:14.868 --> 33:17.246
You're a powerful man

33:17.412 --> 33:19.631
with powerful connections

33:19.789 --> 33:22.918
to the old world of
darkness and grudge.

33:23.084 --> 33:24.961
Say it.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.848
I think you are a shaman.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.559
Henry, I'm... I'm just
a stuffer of dead beasts.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.849
A peddler of tat.
A cigar store Indian.

33:40.310 --> 33:43.610
I can't fix your cancer,
Henry. I'm sorry.

33:43.772 --> 33:46.025
Not my cancer that
needs fixing.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.534
It's not?

33:47.692 --> 33:50.491
It's Liam Sutter.

33:50.654 --> 33:52.702
The little boy?

33:52.864 --> 33:56.619
I believe he needs very
powerful protection, Tavi.

33:56.785 --> 33:59.163
Something terrible
has happened.

33:59.329 --> 34:02.128
His young mother in a state
of shock and disintegration.

34:02.290 --> 34:04.793
Something is attacking

34:04.960 --> 34:07.554
them, I fucking know it.

34:07.712 --> 34:09.885
And I want you to build them

34:10.047 --> 34:11.971
one of those things
to protect them.

34:12.132 --> 34:13.635
What things?

34:13.802 --> 34:15.145
Oh, it's like a golem. Uh...

34:15.303 --> 34:16.725
You told me all about it once.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.264
You mean a tupilaq.

34:18.431 --> 34:19.603
That's it.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.518
A tupilaq.

34:21.685 --> 34:23.608
If I was a shaman,

34:23.770 --> 34:26.569
I would tell you that
there is no such thing anymore.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.199
If I was a shaman,

34:28.358 --> 34:30.702
I would tell you
that to complete a tupilaq

34:30.860 --> 34:32.862
according to all
the old rituals,

34:33.029 --> 34:35.031
the creature must be
finally baptized

34:35.197 --> 34:36.620
in the blood of a murderer.

34:36.783 --> 34:37.955
Do you follow me?

34:38.118 --> 34:39.916
Otherwise it will
have no power.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.877
Now... where would a shaman

34:43.039 --> 34:45.632
lay his hands on half a pint
of murderer's blood, hmm?

35:09.733 --> 35:11.610
May I join you?

35:19.034 --> 35:21.002
This is a 20-year-old

35:21.161 --> 35:24.256
Mossbank single malt whiskey.

35:24.414 --> 35:27.258
Distilled on the banks of...

35:27.417 --> 35:29.840
Dumfries and Galloway

35:30.003 --> 35:33.223
since 1788.

35:33.381 --> 35:35.224
And they have it here.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.260
In Fortitude.

35:39.179 --> 35:41.056
Incredible.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.777
<i>Sláinte.</i>

36:01.993 --> 36:03.836
I've ordered
the lutefisk.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.293
Good choice.

36:06.456 --> 36:08.584
Well, I thought I'm leaving
in a couple days time.

36:10.669 --> 36:14.299
Might as well find out the
truth about the lutefisk.

36:32.482 --> 36:35.281
Have you ever shot a man?

36:35.443 --> 36:36.615
Not with that.

36:39.114 --> 36:40.957
The lutefisk.

36:41.116 --> 36:42.993
Thank you.

36:47.997 --> 36:49.590
The truth about the lutefisk...

36:49.749 --> 36:51.626
Mm-hmm?

36:51.793 --> 36:53.670
...is you should never eat the lutefisk.

36:59.509 --> 37:01.386
Ugh.

37:19.195 --> 37:22.039
Liam.

37:22.198 --> 37:24.041
Baby

37:24.200 --> 37:26.077
Can you hear me?

37:30.248 --> 37:32.091
Can you hear me, Liam?

37:32.250 --> 37:34.127
Baby

37:44.179 --> 37:47.479
You don't know me.
My name's Elena.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.270
Um...

37:55.440 --> 37:57.693
It was my fault.

37:57.859 --> 38:00.282
What happened.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.873
Not your dad's fault.

38:04.032 --> 38:06.285
It was my fault.

38:11.539 --> 38:15.043
I'm so sorry, Liam.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.594
I'm so sorry.

38:27.931 --> 38:32.232
It was Christmas Day
when we landed in Scotland.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.526
Prestwick.

38:35.688 --> 38:38.362
And there were six
of us, all FBI,

38:38.525 --> 38:41.119
and they had a little coach
to take us to this town.

38:41.277 --> 38:44.156
And when we got to
the town, Lockerbie,

38:44.322 --> 38:47.201
a lot of the houses
were still burning.

38:47.367 --> 38:49.961
And we were each appointed
a local constable.

38:50.119 --> 38:52.963
The fella that was appointed
to me, his name was Stephen.

38:53.122 --> 38:56.296
And we were given radios
and maps and...

38:56.459 --> 39:01.590
a huge sack filled
with polythene body bags.

39:01.756 --> 39:07.479
So Stephen and I, we set
out across this moor.

39:07.637 --> 39:12.484
Every piece of anybody
we found...

39:12.642 --> 39:15.486
we picked up.

39:15.645 --> 39:17.693
I photographed it,

39:17.856 --> 39:20.700
and he bagged it.

39:20.859 --> 39:25.035
And we did that
all day, all night

39:25.196 --> 39:27.244
until our
torches ran out.

39:27.407 --> 39:29.501
And then we just sat
there in the dark,

39:29.659 --> 39:32.663
surrounded by 18...

39:32.829 --> 39:36.129
full body bags.

39:37.250 --> 39:40.094
But there was not a whole person

39:40.253 --> 39:42.506
in any one of them.

39:46.676 --> 39:49.395
And Stephen said,

39:49.554 --> 39:53.275
"Why could they not
have just stayed up there?

39:53.433 --> 39:57.404
Why did they have
to come down?"

39:57.562 --> 40:02.409
He said, "Why could they not
have just stayed up there?

40:02.567 --> 40:05.992
“Flying around the lovely world,

40:06.154 --> 40:08.407
forever."

40:18.374 --> 40:20.627

40:43.399 --> 40:45.652

Fuck you, Ronnie.

your scars...

41:56.514 --> 41:59.267
...I'll show you mine.

42:02.979 --> 42:05.027
This is about Pettigrew,
isn't it?

42:07.525 --> 42:09.823
I know
what you're doing.

42:11.612 --> 42:14.206
Psychology.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.414
You're using psychology.

42:30.298 --> 42:33.472
Billy Pettigrew
wasn't eaten by a bear.

42:33.634 --> 42:35.307
He was murdered.

42:35.470 --> 42:39.566
Now Professor Charlie Stoddart
has been murdered as well.

42:39.724 --> 42:42.318
The governor is responsible.

42:42.477 --> 42:45.947
Her sheriff killed them both.

43:18.971 --> 43:21.394
Someone called in,

43:21.557 --> 43:24.401
said they'd seen a man walking
out of town on his own

43:24.560 --> 43:26.233
along the coastline,

43:26.395 --> 43:28.489
without a rifle.

43:28.648 --> 43:30.867
Bear season.

43:31.025 --> 43:33.869
Time of year
when...

43:34.028 --> 43:36.076
the sea ice
is mostly gone

43:36.239 --> 43:39.083
and the bears are unable
to find seals

43:39.242 --> 43:41.119
so they're crazy with hunger.

43:43.621 --> 43:47.046
I drove slowly out of town
along the coast road

43:47.208 --> 43:49.427
looking for the missing man.

43:52.130 --> 43:54.633
After ten miles, I turned back

43:54.799 --> 43:57.427
because nobody could've got
that far in this temperature.

43:59.178 --> 44:02.227
On the way back,

44:02.390 --> 44:06.065
I saw a huge bear
down on the foreshore

44:06.227 --> 44:08.070
dragging its kill
across the-the rocks

44:08.229 --> 44:11.324
and the-the ice floes.

44:11.482 --> 44:14.782
I knew at once
what this was going to be.

44:16.237 --> 44:18.581
I pulled over,

44:18.739 --> 44:20.992
took my rifle,

44:21.159 --> 44:24.629
ran down onto the foreshore.

44:31.919 --> 44:34.513
The bear...

44:34.672 --> 44:37.425
was leaning over its kill.

44:37.592 --> 44:39.265
And...

44:39.427 --> 44:43.022
and in the split second
I took aim,

44:43.181 --> 44:46.685
I could see
that what it was tearing apart

44:46.851 --> 44:49.024
wasn't a seal.

44:49.187 --> 44:51.485
It was a man.

44:53.733 --> 44:56.486
The bear was disemboweling

44:56.652 --> 44:59.201
and eating Billy Pettigrew.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.871
And Pettigrew...

45:03.034 --> 45:05.787
was screaming.

45:05.953 --> 45:09.423
Inhuman screams.

45:12.668 --> 45:15.547
I shot Pettigrew
through the head.

45:38.110 --> 45:40.363
No witness.

45:42.323 --> 45:44.621
No motive.

45:46.035 --> 45:48.333
No crime.

45:53.626 --> 45:56.345
A mercy killing.

46:02.635 --> 46:04.888
Okay.

46:09.850 --> 46:12.148
Except...

46:14.272 --> 46:17.867

What?

48:23.609 --> 48:25.737
When was the carpet replaced?

48:25.903 --> 48:29.453
Why do you change
a carpet?

Because there is
an immovable stain on it, right?

48:32.618 --> 48:35.667
