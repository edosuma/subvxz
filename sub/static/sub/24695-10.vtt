00:35.290 --> 00:38.726
- I asked
for double pepperoni.

00:38.794 --> 00:43.564
- Next time.

00:43.632 --> 00:47.568
- Get a paper plate
for the padre here.

00:49.404 --> 00:51.038
- [quietly]
thank you.

00:51.106 --> 00:55.209
- Today, when I say "jump,"

00:55.277 --> 00:57.378
They say "how high?"

00:57.446 --> 00:59.880
For nine years,
it was the other way around.

00:59.948 --> 01:03.017
- Everything's a cycle, elvis.
- Oh, yeah.

01:03.085 --> 01:07.355
Rot and rejuvenation.

01:07.422 --> 01:11.392
[footsteps approach]

01:11.460 --> 01:14.862
- Hey, hey, marcus.

01:17.265 --> 01:20.901
- Aah. Look at you.

01:20.969 --> 01:22.637
And how's your little girl?

01:22.704 --> 01:24.238
- She's no longer so little.

01:24.306 --> 01:26.240
- Yeah, I'm sure she's not.

01:26.308 --> 01:28.943
And the move to new york--
everything's fine?

01:29.011 --> 01:33.648
- Doing pretty well.
- Partner?

01:33.715 --> 01:35.249
You'll never have another one
like me.

01:35.317 --> 01:39.153
- Well, he's good.
Maybe even special.

01:39.221 --> 01:42.590
- [exhales]
I'm glad you came...

01:42.658 --> 01:44.325
For them.

01:44.393 --> 01:45.726
Courtney would've been
about your age.

01:45.794 --> 01:49.063
They feel a connection.
- Serena.

01:49.131 --> 01:51.265
Thank you for coming.

01:51.333 --> 01:56.804
- Hello, may.
It's okay.

02:05.614 --> 02:08.181
- Reverend?
- Right here, elvis.

02:08.250 --> 02:11.852
- Everything's in order?

02:11.920 --> 02:14.722
I've got something to say.

02:26.401 --> 02:28.569
Y'all came here to see me die
for the murder

02:28.637 --> 02:31.605
Of courtney gunderson.

02:31.673 --> 02:34.842
Well, I'm gonna have
to disappoint you.

02:34.910 --> 02:37.445
I've done my share
of life taking

02:37.512 --> 02:38.646
And I've enjoyed it.

02:38.714 --> 02:41.682
And I do not regret it.

02:41.750 --> 02:46.053
But I did not kill courtney.

02:48.023 --> 02:51.759
This so-called act of justice

02:51.827 --> 02:53.828
Is without purpose

02:53.895 --> 02:58.833
Because he's still out there.

03:00.435 --> 03:04.371
And he'll keep doing

03:04.439 --> 03:07.641
What he likes to do.

03:07.709 --> 03:10.377
So...

03:10.445 --> 03:12.580
I just wanted to share that
with you all.

03:18.320 --> 03:22.223
Any time, warden.

03:22.290 --> 03:25.025
- It's not true.
He's evil.

03:25.093 --> 03:29.463
He seized on a last chance
to cause pain.

03:29.531 --> 03:31.966
Evil.

03:38.607 --> 03:41.709
- [exhales]

[monitor flatlines]

04:00.896 --> 04:03.063
[cell phone rings]

04:05.967 --> 04:10.371
- Hello? Oh, hi, honey.

04:10.438 --> 04:13.908
No, I'm just leaving work
right now.

04:13.975 --> 04:19.346
Uh-huh. Yeah, his ear
should be better by now.

04:19.414 --> 04:20.981
Well, take him
to the emergency room.

04:21.048 --> 04:22.783
I'll meet you there.

04:40.084 --> 04:42.384
<i>Episode: Disciple</i>

04:42.385 --> 04:45.385
<i>Sub by Adriano_CSI</i>

05:25.362 --> 05:28.163
I got here at 6:15 to open 
the side office and saw the car.

05:28.231 --> 05:29.298
Knew it wasn't any
of our people.

05:29.366 --> 05:30.366
- The gate was locked?

05:30.434 --> 05:31.968
- Yeah,
but that don't mean much.

05:32.035 --> 05:33.235
- How many people
have the keys?

05:33.303 --> 05:35.504
- Subcontractors coming
and going for over nine months.

05:35.572 --> 05:37.473
People hitting on them
for a copy of the key.

05:37.541 --> 05:38.808
- The key
for a construction site?

05:38.875 --> 05:40.242
What's the appeal?

05:40.310 --> 05:42.244
- People got reasons to park
someplace that's private.

05:42.312 --> 05:44.780
What beats this?

05:44.848 --> 05:49.619
- Single large caliber shot
to his left temple.

05:49.686 --> 05:52.021
- Very large entry.
- Yeah.

05:52.089 --> 05:54.991
Bullet probably deformed
on its way through the glass.

05:55.058 --> 05:56.926
- A hero. No receipt.

05:56.994 --> 06:00.096
But there's a paycheck stub
made out to diego caldez

06:00.163 --> 06:02.632
From the agora diner
in queens.

06:02.699 --> 06:04.100
- He works there,
he eats for free.

06:04.167 --> 06:06.469
- Well, I'm guessing
since he's got zero body temp,

06:06.536 --> 06:10.272
Time of death
is before 2:00 am.

06:10.340 --> 06:12.241
Check out his pants.

06:12.309 --> 06:15.645
- Oh. His pants
and his underwear

06:15.712 --> 06:17.747
Are down around his ankles.

06:17.814 --> 06:20.650
He was in the middle
of a, uh, major distraction.

06:20.717 --> 06:24.587
- I'm guessing she was female.

06:24.655 --> 06:28.958
So it's a cheating housewife
followed by a jealous husband

06:29.026 --> 06:32.561
Or a prostitute teamed
with her pimp to rob him.

06:32.629 --> 06:33.796
- Not robbed.

06:33.864 --> 06:36.732
Mr. Caldez was carrying
over $1,000 in ready cash

06:36.800 --> 06:41.570
Along with, uh, betting slips
from an o.T.B.

06:41.638 --> 06:45.074
- So whoever it was,
where'd she go?

06:45.142 --> 06:48.144
- We better get a dog.

06:48.211 --> 06:50.446
Let's cordon off
this whole area, grant, please.

06:50.514 --> 06:52.682
All the way from there
back to the car. Thank you.

06:52.749 --> 06:54.383
- He's losing the scent
right here.

06:54.451 --> 06:56.485
I don't know, maybe they got
in a car or something.

06:56.553 --> 06:57.987
- Or maybe she didn't
want to get in

06:58.055 --> 06:59.622
And they struggled.

06:59.690 --> 07:03.793
- That was broken off the shoe.
Thank you, joe.

07:05.996 --> 07:09.265
- He was good.
Fast on the grill.

07:09.332 --> 07:11.467
Very fast. It's terrible.

07:11.535 --> 07:14.236
- Yeah. Did you happen
to see him last night, pete?

07:14.304 --> 07:15.438
- Around 10:00, 10:30.

07:15.505 --> 07:16.906
Picked up a sandwich
on the way home.

07:16.973 --> 07:19.008
- He pick up anything
besides the hero?

07:19.076 --> 07:21.777
- What?

07:21.845 --> 07:24.213
[distant chatter, laughter]

07:24.281 --> 07:25.815
- That's the wrong way
to think.

07:25.882 --> 07:27.149
Even though his wife
was in florida,

07:27.217 --> 07:28.317
Diego was very married.

07:28.385 --> 07:30.086
- Well, we happen to know

07:30.153 --> 07:32.922
That he wasn't very married
last night.

07:32.989 --> 07:35.291
Thank you, pete.

07:35.358 --> 07:37.326
- Doesn't even let me
out of the car.

07:37.394 --> 07:39.495
My nails in the air--

07:39.563 --> 07:41.263
[overlapping chatter
and giggling]

07:41.331 --> 07:44.500
- Yeah, that's right, ladies.
We're cops.

07:44.568 --> 07:47.837
But the good news:
Not vice.

07:47.904 --> 07:52.908
That's diego caldez.
He worked here.

07:52.976 --> 07:57.646
No? He bet the horses.
Also liked having a good time.

07:57.714 --> 08:00.249
Which is why, uh,
we're asking.

08:00.317 --> 08:03.452
Thank you. Did, uh, anybody
see him last night?

08:06.256 --> 08:08.557
- Come on.
Don't force us to turn cop.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.926
- Around 11:00,
he stopped me on the street

08:10.994 --> 08:13.429
For a quick and easy,
but I was booked for a stand.

08:13.497 --> 08:17.099
- So he moved on.
You see who he picked?

08:17.167 --> 08:20.269
- Tough times.
Got a lot of choices out there.

08:20.337 --> 08:23.639
- All right.
Well, uh, stay safe.

08:23.707 --> 08:26.876
Thank you.

08:26.943 --> 08:28.878
- You know the first place
I go in cases like this.

08:28.945 --> 08:30.146
- Oh, yeah, I know
where you go.

08:30.213 --> 08:31.413
The home.
- Mm-hmm.

08:31.481 --> 08:33.515
- You think the wife
was sick of the hookers

08:33.582 --> 08:35.484
And the gambling,
but the wife's in florida.

08:35.552 --> 08:36.818
[footsteps approach]

08:36.886 --> 08:38.754
- Prints found on the heel
from the crime scene

08:38.822 --> 08:40.655
Are from two women,
maricela fernandez

08:40.724 --> 08:42.024
And gabriella belteno.

08:42.092 --> 08:44.226
- In the system?
Let me guess: Prostitutes?

08:44.294 --> 08:46.529
- Yeah. Maricela's thumbprint
matches a latent

08:46.596 --> 08:48.597
Found on the door
of the victim's car.

08:48.665 --> 08:50.432
- Hmm. And look,
they share an address

08:50.500 --> 08:54.136
In washington heights.

08:54.204 --> 08:59.408
[baby cries]

08:59.476 --> 09:03.012
- Maricela fernandez?
- Uh, she no here.

09:03.079 --> 09:05.581
- We're detectives
with the major case squad.

09:05.649 --> 09:09.585
<i>- Como?
- Somos detectivos.</i>

09:09.653 --> 09:11.720
- You haven't seen her
since yesterday?

09:11.788 --> 09:15.191
What time?
- We eat and she leave.

09:15.258 --> 09:16.892
When she finish,
she always come home,

09:16.960 --> 09:18.360
Never leave her baby.

09:18.428 --> 09:21.197
- You didn't work with her
on the street?

09:21.264 --> 09:24.033
- When she go,
I stay with the baby.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.001
I go, she stay
with the baby.

09:26.069 --> 09:29.071
- All right. Is there a man
you worked with? A pimp?

09:29.139 --> 09:32.875
<i>- No. Ningun. No men.</i>

09:32.943 --> 09:34.677
Just she and I.

09:34.744 --> 09:38.414
<i>We together. Entiendes?</i>

09:41.985 --> 09:44.653
<i>Que crees?</i>

09:44.721 --> 09:46.088
<i>Crees que esta muerta?</i>

09:46.156 --> 09:50.593
<i>- No se. Lo siento.</i>

09:50.660 --> 09:53.596
We don't know.

09:58.034 --> 09:59.501
- You must've tried
to call her.

09:59.569 --> 10:04.039
- Yes, but she no answer.

10:04.107 --> 10:07.743
- Okay, tower one is here.

10:07.811 --> 10:10.479
It's reading her.

10:10.547 --> 10:12.147
- There's a second tower.
Where's that?

10:12.215 --> 10:15.017
Is that the pelham park area?
- Yeah.

10:15.085 --> 10:16.619
There's a line crossing
from the third tower.

10:16.686 --> 10:19.488
Puts the phone here.
- That's hunter island.

10:19.556 --> 10:22.658
- Yeah. It's the kazimiroff
nature trail.

10:26.329 --> 10:28.030
- Are we close?

10:28.098 --> 10:30.432
- We should be right on top
of the phone.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.669
[phone ringing, dog whining]

10:33.737 --> 10:37.740
Here. Here.

10:37.807 --> 10:42.344
Uh-huh.

10:42.412 --> 10:45.547
Ah. Oh, boy.

10:46.917 --> 10:50.019
[dogs barking]

10:50.086 --> 10:53.022
They found her.

10:53.089 --> 10:56.125
- Jeans are lumpy
at her thighs.

10:56.192 --> 10:59.495
Panties probably down.
- So raped.

10:59.562 --> 11:01.363
But then
he dressed her again.

11:01.431 --> 11:04.533
- Modest. The righteous
are always the worst.

11:08.538 --> 11:10.306
- Body is well
into rigor mortis.

11:10.373 --> 11:13.609
There's discoloration
at her neck.

11:13.677 --> 11:15.377
Probably strangled.

11:15.445 --> 11:18.747
- Strangles the female.
Goes son of sam on the male.

11:22.252 --> 11:23.585
- Well, now there's a--

11:23.653 --> 11:26.522
There's an odd little bit
of synchronicity.

11:26.589 --> 11:27.723
- What?

11:27.791 --> 11:29.525
- "hello, from the gutters
of new york city."

11:29.592 --> 11:31.160
Son of sam.

11:31.227 --> 11:33.495
He's up for parole
next month.

11:33.563 --> 11:35.130
- Come on.
You're not thinking copycat.

11:35.198 --> 11:36.432
- Killer uses a .44.

11:36.499 --> 11:39.335
Comes upon a couple
about to have sex in a car.

11:39.402 --> 11:42.371
Anything's possible.
Right?

11:47.250 --> 11:49.385
 Ischemia. blood
 flow is restricted.

11:49.452 --> 11:51.320
The brain dies.

11:51.388 --> 11:54.223
These burst capillaries,
tramline bruising.

11:54.291 --> 11:55.958
A device was used
to strangle her.

11:56.026 --> 11:57.827
Maybe a steel rod.
Piece of wood.

11:57.894 --> 12:00.429
- .
- Yeah, possibly.

12:00.497 --> 12:02.698
- That's a hell of an odor.

12:02.766 --> 12:03.833
- Sort of like
the greatest hits

12:03.900 --> 12:05.434
Of every bad smell
there is, huh?

12:05.502 --> 12:06.602
- Thanks for the warning.

12:06.670 --> 12:08.971
- Well, murder weapon
was probably filthy.

12:09.039 --> 12:11.607
We found a dna stew
on the skin of her neck.

12:11.675 --> 12:13.843
Human, animal, plant.

12:13.910 --> 12:16.579
- Well, he chose
a dumping area.

12:16.646 --> 12:18.280
Maybe he picked up something
at random.

12:18.348 --> 12:19.615
- She raped?

12:19.683 --> 12:20.850
- Well, she had sex
before she died

12:20.917 --> 12:22.852
With someone who used
a spermicidal condom.

12:22.919 --> 12:24.220
- Maybe some trick
who picked her up.

12:24.287 --> 12:28.457
- No, I'm pretty sure
it wasn't.

12:28.525 --> 12:30.693
We found microscopic fibers.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.829
She was probably tied
with rawhide.

12:33.897 --> 12:36.365
Also the evidence indicates
that during intercourse,

12:36.433 --> 12:37.967
She had her back
to the killer.

12:38.034 --> 12:40.903
- Wow. Forensic pathology,
it's come a long way.

12:40.971 --> 12:43.739
You're able to determine
sexual position?

12:43.807 --> 12:45.674
- The chemical compound
found on her neck

12:45.742 --> 12:48.611
Was also present on the back
of her exposed thighs.

12:48.678 --> 12:51.680
- Hmm. These scratches...
- She was a junkie.

12:51.748 --> 12:54.416
Opiates make you itch.

12:54.484 --> 12:59.188
Those were self-inflicted.
But this wasn't.

12:59.256 --> 13:01.690
Ecchymoses-type contusion.

13:01.758 --> 13:06.028
A love bite.

13:06.096 --> 13:09.732
- It's just below
her left hip.

13:09.799 --> 13:13.636
I know it.

13:13.703 --> 13:16.138
You were right
that it's a copycat.

13:16.206 --> 13:20.042
But he's not copying
son of sam.

13:22.812 --> 13:26.749
- So elvis howell killed women
in illinois and indiana.

13:26.816 --> 13:29.018
- Seven women
were known victims.

13:29.085 --> 13:32.154
He used a police baton
to strangle prostitutes.

13:32.222 --> 13:35.491
And used a condom.
- Safe sex.

13:35.558 --> 13:39.094
- Yeah. And always a hickey
near the victim's left hip.

13:39.162 --> 13:41.430
Howell once told a reporter
the mark was his salaam

13:41.498 --> 13:43.599
"to the female womb,
where the cycle of life

13:43.667 --> 13:45.768
Starts with a seed."

13:45.835 --> 13:47.202
This is a copycat.

13:47.270 --> 13:50.973
Everything about this case
matches howell's last victim.

13:51.041 --> 13:52.474
Her name
was courtney gunderson.

13:52.542 --> 13:54.510
- This a case you worked on?

13:54.577 --> 13:56.045
- My fjrst homicide conviction.

13:56.112 --> 13:58.447
We wanted to make cases
on the other victims.

13:58.515 --> 14:00.816
But the best evidence
tied him to courtney.

14:00.884 --> 14:04.720
- Yeah. This guy made some kind
of death house statement

14:04.788 --> 14:07.923
Saying that her killer
was still out there.

14:07.991 --> 14:10.859
- Yeah. The last ditch ploy
of a condemned man.

14:10.927 --> 14:14.196
- Right. But, you know,
I think a, uh, check

14:14.264 --> 14:17.032
Of this guy's visitors
is worth the time.

14:17.100 --> 14:19.535
- The jury had a verdict
before their chairs were warm.

14:19.602 --> 14:21.937
Our case held through nine years
of appeals.

14:22.005 --> 14:23.806
I think we can avoid
the grassy knoll, zack.

14:23.873 --> 14:25.341
- I'm just thinking
about what this guy said.

14:25.408 --> 14:27.676
- I know what he said.
I was there.

14:27.744 --> 14:30.079
- Okay. Time out. Time out.
Let's stick to what we know.

14:30.146 --> 14:31.880
Huh? Howell was a twisted
son of a bitch

14:31.948 --> 14:34.049
And maybe somebody's copying
his work.

14:34.117 --> 14:36.752
- Okay. I'm good with that.

14:36.820 --> 14:38.921
- Okay. So I'm going to get
a warrant for courtney

14:38.989 --> 14:41.090
And maricela's autopsy photos.

14:41.157 --> 14:43.359
And we will compare this homage
to the female womb

14:43.426 --> 14:44.460
With what we have.

14:44.527 --> 14:45.861
- We should also see
the autopsy photos

14:45.929 --> 14:49.131
Of the other women
howell is suspected of killing.

14:49.199 --> 14:54.970
- Chop. Chop. Chop. Chop. Chop.
- Hey. You put that down, son.

14:55.038 --> 14:57.172
Before you hurt yourself.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.141
Hey, ernie, you ready
to put in that new mulch pile

14:59.209 --> 15:00.376
Behind the greenhouse?

15:00.443 --> 15:02.478
- Six feet wide,
12 feet long, 24 inches deep.

15:02.545 --> 15:05.280
- Magic numbers.
- Multiples, elvy.

15:05.348 --> 15:08.317
Start with one. Presto.
Zygote becomes two. Doubled.

15:08.385 --> 15:13.222
Six becomes 12 becomes 24.
- Ern. Chicken parts.

15:26.202 --> 15:29.405
Ern.

15:32.776 --> 15:34.309
- Look at me. How can I measure
without that?

15:34.377 --> 15:35.711
Bad. Bad. Bad. Damn.
- Ernie.

15:35.779 --> 15:37.446
- Exact 6 and 12 then 24.
How can I miss it?

15:37.514 --> 15:41.917
It's hanging right there.
- Ernie, it's all right now.

15:41.985 --> 15:45.187
Nothing bad's gonna happen,
okay?

15:53.430 --> 15:56.632
[growls]

15:56.699 --> 15:57.866
[grunts]

15:57.934 --> 16:00.636
- I like ernie.
- Yeah, he's a good man.

16:00.703 --> 16:03.705
- But I want to be like you.

16:03.773 --> 16:06.442
- Yeah?

16:10.713 --> 16:12.314
- Cook county m.E.'s office

16:12.382 --> 16:14.950
Can't find courtney gunderson's
autopsy photos.

16:15.018 --> 16:18.353
- No. They're lost?
- More likely stolen.

16:18.421 --> 16:19.988
Ted bundy's been dead
for two decades.

16:20.056 --> 16:23.592
Half his victims' autopsy photos
are for sale on the internet.

16:23.660 --> 16:26.962
But luckily, courtney gunderson
wasn't cremated.

16:27.030 --> 16:30.999
- So now we get a court order
and, uh, exhume the body?

16:31.067 --> 16:32.301
- Is that necessary?

16:32.368 --> 16:34.770
Any marks on courtney
were made by elvis howell.

16:34.838 --> 16:37.773
- Unless he didn't work alone.

16:37.841 --> 16:40.342
Bruno and bianchi.
Norris and bittiker.

16:40.410 --> 16:43.979
It happens.
- I'll call a judge.

16:54.324 --> 16:57.593
- What's your name?
- Rayanne.

16:57.660 --> 17:02.231
- Rayanne.
It's a pretty name.

17:02.298 --> 17:05.834
- I don't do rough stuff.

17:05.902 --> 17:08.670
And I don't do nothing
without protection.

17:08.738 --> 17:11.839
- That sounds good.

17:11.907 --> 17:14.576
Why don't you
make me right again?

17:21.416 --> 17:23.585
- Swing by jackson and arch,
baby.

17:23.653 --> 17:26.555
I got to score some jivvie.

17:26.623 --> 17:29.324
- Might be able
to save you a trip.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.335
- [clears throat]

17:40.403 --> 17:44.039
- Marcus.
- Hello, serena.

17:46.342 --> 17:49.244
Oh, uh, zack nichols,
this is marcus feingold, my--

17:49.312 --> 17:52.581
- Mentor
from chicago homicide.

17:52.649 --> 17:55.284
Very good to meet you,
mr. Feingold.

17:55.351 --> 17:56.952
- Oh, pleasure
to meet you, sir.

17:57.020 --> 17:58.620
- What are you doing
in new york?

17:58.688 --> 18:00.889
- Hello.
It's marcus, sweetheart.

18:00.957 --> 18:03.091
Remember? Now you want
to tell me what the hell

18:03.159 --> 18:05.761
Is going on?

18:05.828 --> 18:07.296
- We have a prostitute.

18:07.363 --> 18:09.565
Raped. Strangled. Love bite.
The works.

18:09.632 --> 18:10.866
- Oh, okay.

18:10.934 --> 18:12.701
So all this mess is because
that hillbilly snapper

18:12.769 --> 18:14.269
Wasted two minutes
of everybody's time

18:14.337 --> 18:16.405
Announcing that he didn't kill
courtney gunderson.

18:16.472 --> 18:18.507
[scoffs] don't tell me
you believed him.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.909
- No. No. It's just
about being sure that--

18:20.977 --> 18:23.545
- You know, her folks
have spent the last nine years

18:23.613 --> 18:25.080
Learning to walk past
an empty bedroom.

18:25.148 --> 18:26.381
- I know that
as well as you, marcus.

18:26.449 --> 18:27.516
- The cook county coroner's

18:27.584 --> 18:28.817
About to pull
their daughter's body

18:28.885 --> 18:29.918
Out of the ground.

18:29.986 --> 18:32.821
And it's because
you want to be sure?

18:32.889 --> 18:34.223
Don't do this, serena.

18:34.290 --> 18:37.492
- It was my idea to disinter
the body, mr. Feingold.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.228
- The autopsy photos
are missing.

18:39.295 --> 18:42.264
We want to compare courtney--
- that's right.

18:42.332 --> 18:44.032
Because no pervert's
going to find those photos

18:44.100 --> 18:46.768
On the internet.

18:46.836 --> 18:48.570
- I see.

18:48.638 --> 18:49.838
Who'd you grease

18:49.906 --> 18:51.740
To sit on courtney gunderson's
photos, marcus?

18:51.808 --> 18:53.809
- What did you say?
- I think you heard me.

18:53.876 --> 18:55.877
You want to help
the gunderson family,

18:55.945 --> 18:57.879
Spend a buck and light a candle
at st. Patrick's

18:57.947 --> 19:00.782
For those autopsy photos
to miraculously turn up

19:00.850 --> 19:04.152
Or she's coming out
of the ground.

19:14.564 --> 19:18.033
- In...The...Ditch.

19:18.101 --> 19:21.036
Got you.

19:21.104 --> 19:23.905
I'm jonesing hard.

19:27.577 --> 19:31.179
Take me down, little suzie.

19:34.183 --> 19:36.852
Just give me a sec.

19:36.919 --> 19:41.857
Baby, can you just give me
a sec?

19:41.924 --> 19:45.160
Undo your pants.

20:19.829 --> 20:22.631
- Somebody lit that candle
at st. Patrick's.

20:30.993 --> 20:32.527
- Two suction bruises.

20:32.595 --> 20:34.162
One from courtney gunderson.

20:34.230 --> 20:36.565
The other
from maricela fernandez.

20:36.632 --> 20:37.966
- Remarkably similar.

20:38.034 --> 20:40.836
And unless elvis howell
puckered up from the grave,

20:40.903 --> 20:43.872
He did not put that hickey
on maricela fernandez.

20:43.940 --> 20:47.075
- Let's hear dr. Sunday's
expert opinion.

20:47.143 --> 20:49.244
- The so-called hickey
is a suction bruise.

20:49.312 --> 20:50.545
The lips create
an air-tight seal.

20:50.613 --> 20:53.348
Suction creates a cluster
of petechial bruises.

20:53.416 --> 20:55.617
On these--credited with being
howell's earlier victims--

20:55.685 --> 20:57.452
The bruising is less defined.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.956
See, his thinner lips
created less of a seal.

21:01.023 --> 21:03.024
But these two differ
from those.

21:03.092 --> 21:05.394
The bruises made on these women
were made by someone

21:05.461 --> 21:06.695
With full lips.

21:06.763 --> 21:08.530
- And you know that because...?

21:08.598 --> 21:09.998
- It was harder for howell
to form a seal

21:10.066 --> 21:11.500
So he used his teeth.

21:11.567 --> 21:13.835
These impressions match
his dental arch.

21:13.903 --> 21:15.370
You don't have that
on these other victims.

21:15.438 --> 21:17.606
- If it's not howell's mark
on courtney gunderson,

21:17.673 --> 21:19.441
Are we thinking howell
was innocent?

21:19.509 --> 21:21.777
- Even if courtney's mark
wasn't made by howell,

21:21.844 --> 21:22.944
He still could've killed her.

21:23.012 --> 21:26.548
- Or somebody he worked with.

21:26.616 --> 21:28.483
A disciple?

21:28.551 --> 21:32.154
We should find out
who howell knew.

21:32.221 --> 21:33.955
- Case is closed in chicago.

21:34.023 --> 21:35.390
- Yes.
I'm--I'm aware of that.

21:35.458 --> 21:38.560
But he might've had a friend

21:38.628 --> 21:41.363
Or soue name in the visitors'
logs of the prison.

21:41.431 --> 21:43.665
- I'll coordinate
with chicago pd.

21:43.733 --> 21:45.000
Get somebody to check it.

21:45.067 --> 21:48.136
- They already tried to get cute
with the autopsy photos.

21:48.204 --> 21:52.941
Let me go to chicago.
- Keep your head down.

21:55.611 --> 21:57.712
- Hey, would you like me
to, uh, come with you?

21:57.780 --> 21:59.848
I could use
the frequent flyer miles.

21:59.916 --> 22:02.117
- Are you saying
I can't be trusted?

22:02.185 --> 22:04.186
- No, serena.
Certainly not.

22:04.253 --> 22:05.320
But I know that you have a--

22:05.388 --> 22:06.721
You know,
you have a personal investment

22:06.789 --> 22:07.956
In this whole thing.

22:08.024 --> 22:09.524
- And I don't think elvis howell
was innocent.

22:09.592 --> 22:12.227
And we haven't proven
otherwise.

22:12.295 --> 22:14.863
When and if we do,
I'll accept it.

22:14.931 --> 22:18.333
Good enough?
- Sure.

22:27.510 --> 22:30.712
- You didn't need to come
all this way, detective.

22:30.780 --> 22:32.714
I reviewed all the logs.

22:32.782 --> 22:35.250
Other than his lawyer
and a few curious reporters,

22:35.318 --> 22:37.319
Howell spent nine years
without a visitor.

22:37.386 --> 22:39.888
- Did he make any friends
here inside?

22:39.956 --> 22:42.491
- Condemned men are isolated
from the general population.

22:42.558 --> 22:46.495
The c.O.S in that unit
barely put up with him.

22:46.562 --> 22:48.129
Howell had a funky sense
of humor.

22:48.197 --> 22:50.899
Only one you might call
his friend was our chaplain,

22:50.967 --> 22:54.436
Reverend redding.

22:59.242 --> 23:01.343
- You have a garden
in new york, detective?

23:01.410 --> 23:06.715
- No. No. Just an ant farm
lovingly tended by my daughter.

23:06.782 --> 23:11.753
- My wife loved
heirloom tomatoes.

23:11.821 --> 23:15.790
- Sorry for your loss.
- She's not dead, just gone.

23:15.858 --> 23:17.726
Couldn't deal with it.

23:17.793 --> 23:21.129
I've attended 73 executions.

23:21.197 --> 23:25.600
Carol called it quits
somewhere around the 60th.

23:25.668 --> 23:29.137
- The warden said you were close
to elvis howell.

23:29.205 --> 23:32.707
- He taught me
how to grow vegetables.

23:32.775 --> 23:35.944
And I taught him how to die.

23:36.012 --> 23:37.279
- So there was trust
between you?

23:37.346 --> 23:40.115
- Maybe. But, uh,
it wouldn't be right

23:40.182 --> 23:42.517
For me to share it.

23:42.585 --> 23:45.186
- Even if it could stop someone
from raping and murdering women

23:45.254 --> 23:48.156
Exactly the way he did?

23:48.224 --> 23:49.591
- I'm sorry to hear
about that.

23:49.659 --> 23:51.092
- Before he died,

23:51.160 --> 23:54.162
Elvis asked you if everything
was in order.

23:54.230 --> 23:56.264
- In order?
- He did. I heard him.

23:56.332 --> 23:59.534
You tapped your shirt pocket.
- I can't...

23:59.602 --> 24:01.836
- What was in your shirt pocket?
- Look, I'm not responsible.

24:01.904 --> 24:02.971
- Yes, you are, reverend.

24:03.039 --> 24:06.207
Unless you tell me,
you are responsible.

24:06.275 --> 24:08.577
- He just wanted me
to mail a letter.

24:08.644 --> 24:10.211
- Did he say
what was in the letter?

24:10.279 --> 24:15.684
- Just a good-bye to a friend.
- Name on the letter?

24:15.751 --> 24:18.286
- Dale. Just dale.
No last name.

24:18.354 --> 24:21.423
- Do you know the address?

24:27.263 --> 24:29.164
- Hey, I got a good idea.

24:29.231 --> 24:34.669
From here on in, let's just,
uh, shelve conclusions,

24:34.737 --> 24:37.639
Follow the evidence,
catch this guy.

24:37.707 --> 24:40.575
You know, let's keep
an open mind.

24:40.643 --> 24:42.611
- Both of us.

24:42.678 --> 24:48.049
- Yeah. I said let's.
That's plural. "let us."

24:48.117 --> 24:52.120
- Right.
- Great.

24:52.188 --> 24:55.190
- I meant turn right.

24:59.261 --> 25:03.598
- Unfortunately, uh, we don't
have a, uh, a last name.

25:03.666 --> 25:06.401
All we've got is dale.
- Dale.

25:06.469 --> 25:08.003
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

25:08.070 --> 25:09.404
Well, there was one dale.

25:09.472 --> 25:12.807
Uh, it was dale,
uh, grisco.

25:12.875 --> 25:15.977
- Mm-hmm. Dale grisco.
Is he here?

25:16.045 --> 25:17.278
- No. Thank god.

25:17.346 --> 25:19.648
He would be in his mid-20s
by now.

25:19.715 --> 25:21.683
He ran off
when he was about 15.

25:21.751 --> 25:23.652
- Uh-huh. He gave you
a hard time?

25:23.719 --> 25:27.989
- Uh, yeah.
He was a pain in the butt.

25:28.057 --> 25:32.927
Weird. Would you like a seat,
officer?

25:32.995 --> 25:36.164
I would've, uh, flipped him back
out to county

25:36.232 --> 25:38.099
If it hadn't been
for his life coach.

25:38.167 --> 25:41.469
- His life coach?
- Yeah. Guidance program.

25:41.537 --> 25:44.005
Volunteer comes in
three days a week.

25:44.073 --> 25:47.075
Took dale to a baseball game,
bowling.

25:47.143 --> 25:48.977
They really bonded.
He cared.

25:49.045 --> 25:51.913
And, uh, huh, that made a hell
of a difference.

25:51.981 --> 25:54.683
- About five months ago,
a letter was sent here

25:54.750 --> 25:56.184
Addressed to dale.

25:56.252 --> 25:57.986
- Well, if it was sent
in the last six months,

25:58.054 --> 26:01.923
Uh, I've got it here
somewhere.

26:09.198 --> 26:14.836
- Remember, keep checking
the depth.

26:14.904 --> 26:17.906
- 24 inches.

26:20.776 --> 26:23.411
- Brought you a slurry.

26:26.415 --> 26:29.350
- "dale-y dale, I know
you were dying to visit me

26:29.418 --> 26:31.286
"over the nine-plus years
I've been in here.

26:31.353 --> 26:33.388
"I don't blame you one bit
for my incarceration.

26:33.456 --> 26:36.257
"I told you to run.
You were a good listener.

26:36.325 --> 26:37.726
"so be it.

26:37.793 --> 26:41.129
"although I got credit
for your fine cleansing,

26:41.197 --> 26:43.298
"the last one chosen
was all you.

26:43.365 --> 26:46.434
"I will make it right
and give you your due.

26:46.502 --> 26:51.539
"but give them no name.
Keep uthe good work.

26:51.607 --> 26:54.876
"I want you to know
how proud I am of you.

26:54.944 --> 26:58.046
"embrace the death
that surrounds you.

26:58.114 --> 27:00.882
"and what rots
is sure to rise.

27:00.950 --> 27:05.720
"your teacher and friend,
professor howell.

27:05.788 --> 27:08.289
Elvis has left the building."

27:08.357 --> 27:11.860
- Is it possible
for someone to be that insane?

27:11.927 --> 27:14.229
- It's nice to be loved.
- Yeah.

27:14.296 --> 27:19.400
- Somewhere out there,
elvis howell left a star pupil.

27:19.468 --> 27:20.869
- If he really taught
dale grisco

27:20.936 --> 27:24.072
How to rape and murder,
wasn't it already in him?

27:24.140 --> 27:25.306
Can that be learned?

27:25.374 --> 27:28.643
- Nature or nurture?

27:28.711 --> 27:30.779
We may never know.
- Okay, thanks.

27:30.846 --> 27:33.615
Uh, addicts' hostel
in prospect heights

27:33.682 --> 27:36.618
Filed an m.P. On a 20-year-old
rayanne farmer.

27:36.685 --> 27:38.086
Missing for three days.

27:38.154 --> 27:41.389
Last seen in hunter's point.

27:52.709 --> 27:54.742
There's three teams working
the hunter's point area.

27:55.045 --> 27:56.478
If she's dead,
they haven't found her yet.

27:56.546 --> 27:58.647
- Hmm. Well, he could have
other ideas about dispososing

27:58.715 --> 27:59.948
Of his victims.

28:00.016 --> 28:02.951
Serial killers don't always
limit themselves.

28:03.019 --> 28:05.888
Dmv and irs
have a lot of dale griscos,

28:05.955 --> 28:08.924
But none that match the d.O.B.
That we got from child welfare.

28:08.992 --> 28:10.993
- Maybe he changed his day,
month, or year of birth

28:11.061 --> 28:12.461
To confuse the records.

28:12.529 --> 28:14.463
- Or he gave himself
a new birthday.

28:14.531 --> 28:15.631
Maybe he didn't like himself.

28:15.698 --> 28:19.368
Maybe he isn't a happy
serial killer.

28:19.436 --> 28:21.437
You know, he dressed
maricela fernandez

28:21.504 --> 28:23.405
After he raped
and strangled her, right?

28:23.473 --> 28:24.640
He's still human.

28:24.707 --> 28:27.109
- No way he got any humanity
from his mentor.

28:27.177 --> 28:28.610
But he might have stolen
his name.

28:28.678 --> 28:31.613
- Mm. Mm. Okay.

28:31.681 --> 28:34.249
Dale howell

28:34.317 --> 28:37.786
Or dale elvis.

28:37.854 --> 28:40.222
- It's a big list.
I've got a thought.

28:40.290 --> 28:42.357
Elvis howell taught grisco
how to kill.

28:42.425 --> 28:44.359
What's grisco doing
when he's not killing?

28:44.427 --> 28:45.394
- It's not a bad thought.

28:45.462 --> 28:47.563
Serial killers
don't hibernate.

28:47.630 --> 28:49.064
Manson's followers
had a family.

28:49.132 --> 28:53.035
They played music.
Maybe grisco learned a trade.

28:53.103 --> 28:55.137
- Howell taught reverend redding
how to grow things.

28:55.205 --> 28:57.039
The cycle of life.

28:57.107 --> 28:59.208
Maybe elvis passed this on
to grisco too.

28:59.275 --> 29:03.545
- All right, planting
or gardening--landscaping.

29:03.613 --> 29:07.082
- Landscaping.
Landscaping.

29:07.150 --> 29:10.452
That means he might've gotten
to a construction site.

29:10.520 --> 29:12.754
Here's the list
of all the subcontractors

29:12.822 --> 29:17.926
Who had keys to the gate
where diego caldez was murdered.

29:17.994 --> 29:20.896
Here. Elvis' nursery
and landscaping.

29:20.964 --> 29:21.897
- Yeah.

29:21.965 --> 29:23.432
And it's in jackson heights

29:23.500 --> 29:26.168
Near the dumping ground.

29:26.236 --> 29:29.171
- I'm happier
than I even dreamed, janine.

29:29.239 --> 29:31.507
The work I do.

29:31.574 --> 29:35.611
Having a family.

29:35.678 --> 29:40.516
What is it, hon?

29:40.583 --> 29:44.553
Come on. Come on.

29:44.621 --> 29:49.291
There's something.

29:49.359 --> 29:50.926
- I was in your sock drawer
to sort them.

29:50.994 --> 29:55.030
- And I know what you found.
- I know it's drugs, dale.

29:55.098 --> 29:59.301
- It's heroin.

29:59.369 --> 30:03.138
No, wait.
I took it from ernie.

30:03.206 --> 30:04.740
- Ernie?

30:04.807 --> 30:07.042
- Those day worker guys
are trying to get him to try it.

30:07.110 --> 30:09.144
And he told me,
and I took it.

30:09.212 --> 30:13.582
- Maybe you should let him go.
- Fire ernie?

30:13.650 --> 30:15.450
He deserves a chance.

30:15.518 --> 30:19.054
If one person hadn't come along,
decided I was worth a chance,

30:19.122 --> 30:21.056
I wouldn't have nothing.

30:21.124 --> 30:24.293
I wouldn't have you.
I wouldn't have anything.

30:26.729 --> 30:29.798
All right?
- Dad. Mom.

30:29.866 --> 30:31.700
- Hey.
[grunts]

30:31.768 --> 30:35.370
- Dad, mom, can we get
some popcorn?

30:35.438 --> 30:38.307
- Yes.

31:05.902 --> 31:08.837
- If smell is any indication,

31:08.905 --> 31:11.273
I'd hate to think
what's in here.

31:11.341 --> 31:14.476
- Uh-huh.
We should get a team in here.

31:14.544 --> 31:16.979
- Well, there's fertilizer
everywhere.

31:17.046 --> 31:19.715
We need more than a bad smell
for probable cause.

31:27.223 --> 31:29.124
- Mr. Grisco!

31:29.192 --> 31:32.694
- Hey, hold on. Hold on.
Hey, hold on. We're the police!

31:32.762 --> 31:34.663
- Down on the ground!
Down on the ground.

31:34.731 --> 31:36.198
You won't get hurt.
- I'm--I'm just ernie.

31:36.266 --> 31:38.200
I work with dale.
I don't do drugs.

31:38.268 --> 31:40.535
Dale makes sure of it.
- Drugs? What drugs?

31:40.603 --> 31:44.139
- Heroin's bad.
I know it is.

31:44.207 --> 31:49.044
- Heroin is bad.

31:51.948 --> 31:53.515
- State identification
certificate

31:53.583 --> 31:55.083
But no driver's license?

31:55.151 --> 31:58.654
- I don't drive.
I have problems.

31:58.721 --> 32:00.155
- Problems?

32:00.223 --> 32:02.791
- I was always special ed.
I'm good with numbers.

32:02.859 --> 32:03.925
- Good with numbers?

32:03.993 --> 32:06.194
Ernie, do you happen to know
the combination

32:06.262 --> 32:07.829
To this lock
on the freezer there?

32:07.897 --> 32:11.133
- No.
Only dale knows that.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.368
I only do as dale tells me.

32:13.436 --> 32:16.938
He'll be mad
'cause you took it.

32:17.006 --> 32:19.374
- Took what?
- The stick.

32:19.442 --> 32:23.645
24 inches. Magic numbers
for everything we do.

32:23.713 --> 32:27.783
- You mean this?
24 inches long?

32:27.850 --> 32:30.018
- You stick it in the mulch,
it's just the right depth.

32:30.086 --> 32:34.356
24 inches. 6, 12, 24.
The magic numbers.

32:34.424 --> 32:37.626
- 6, 12, 24.

33:03.186 --> 33:04.252
It's empty.

33:04.320 --> 33:08.557
- Everything in there
has been mulched.

33:18.167 --> 33:22.204
- Oh, my god.
Is this about ernie? The drugs?

33:22.271 --> 33:27.442
- I'll deal with this.
I love you.

33:29.112 --> 33:31.413
- Daddy,
where are you going?

33:31.481 --> 33:33.815
- Turn around.

33:33.883 --> 33:35.717
Hands against the car.

33:42.592 --> 33:45.494
- It's him. Dale grisco.

33:55.104 --> 33:58.673
- They discovered fragments
of human remains.

33:58.741 --> 33:59.941
I think we found
rayanne farmer.

34:00.009 --> 34:01.376
They're probably going
to find others.

34:01.444 --> 34:03.412
So that's it.

34:03.479 --> 34:05.814
- Not for me.
Courtney gunderson.

34:05.882 --> 34:08.283
- It's a closed case,
serena.

34:08.351 --> 34:09.384
- I have to know.

34:09.452 --> 34:11.119
Was it really this guy

34:11.187 --> 34:14.790
Who killed courtney?

34:14.857 --> 34:16.024
- If we reopen
that other case,

34:16.092 --> 34:18.092
We're gonna be challenging
everybody.

34:18.161 --> 34:19.860
We're gonna be challenging
your own police work.

34:19.929 --> 34:21.362
We're gonna be challenging
the prosecution.

34:21.431 --> 34:22.531
Challenging
the highest authority

34:22.598 --> 34:23.764
In the state of illinois.

34:23.833 --> 34:25.199
- And at some point,
I'm gonna have to answer

34:25.268 --> 34:26.601
To a much higher authority.

34:26.668 --> 34:31.806
I have to know.

34:31.873 --> 34:33.574
- None of it fits, man.

34:33.643 --> 34:36.110
- None of what fits?

34:36.179 --> 34:38.914
- These things
that you've done.

34:38.981 --> 34:42.650
It doesn't fit who you are.

34:42.717 --> 34:44.518
- What, my family?
- Yeah.

34:44.587 --> 34:47.822
- Btk had a family.
See, he was an usher in church.

34:47.889 --> 34:49.891
- No, no, there's--
there's something--

34:49.958 --> 34:51.793
Something different
about you, dale.

34:51.860 --> 34:55.297
- You have evidence, so you know
all you need to know.

34:55.364 --> 34:57.265
- Yeah. It works for us.

34:57.333 --> 35:01.670
But, uh,
do you want your boy

35:01.737 --> 35:03.839
Labeled the son
of the monster?

35:03.906 --> 35:09.444
- I've cleansed the world
of whores and whoremongers.

35:09.512 --> 35:12.481
- Courtney gunderson
taught kindergarten.

35:12.548 --> 35:16.852
- Hmm. Mistakes are made.
[laughs]

35:16.919 --> 35:20.188
I mean, you killed elvis.

35:20.256 --> 35:22.691
[gasps]

35:22.758 --> 35:26.828
- Here. Look at these pictures
of courtney gunderson, dale.

35:26.896 --> 35:29.698
You couldn't
have mistakenly thought

35:29.765 --> 35:32.834
That courtney gunderson
was a prostitute.

35:32.902 --> 35:35.537
- Why didn't you come forward,
admit to courtney?

35:35.605 --> 35:37.806
- He wanted me free.

35:37.874 --> 35:39.474
Cleansing
as he would've cleansed.

35:39.542 --> 35:42.344
Turn them into plant life.
Something clean.

35:42.411 --> 35:46.381
- Mulching
helped make them disappear.

35:49.952 --> 35:52.621
You were 15 when courtney
was murdered.

35:52.688 --> 35:54.322
You were just a kid.

35:54.390 --> 35:58.193
Is that why you picked
the wrong victim?

35:58.261 --> 36:01.429
- [laughs]
what does it matter?

36:01.497 --> 36:04.633
- Because something
about what you've told us

36:04.700 --> 36:05.700
Doesn't jibe.

36:05.768 --> 36:08.470
There was no cleansing
with courtney.

36:08.538 --> 36:11.373
Courtney was clean.
A clean girl.

36:11.440 --> 36:14.709
Walking from school
in a summer dress.

36:14.777 --> 36:16.878
Now, she gets pulled
into a van.

36:16.946 --> 36:19.614
Howell's van.
We know that from a fiber match.

36:19.682 --> 36:22.551
Where were you?
- Hmm.

36:22.618 --> 36:26.922
Obviously I was there.

36:26.989 --> 36:28.223
- And howell was there.

36:28.291 --> 36:30.258
You were 15.
Too young to drive.

36:30.326 --> 36:34.963
He drove.

36:35.031 --> 36:37.766
- Elvis drove.
- Okay. Okay.

36:37.833 --> 36:42.637
So he must've prepped you.
Told you what to look for.

36:42.705 --> 36:46.341
But that would've en
prostitutes,

36:46.409 --> 36:48.877
Not courtney.

36:48.945 --> 36:51.646
She's so different
from his other victims.

36:51.714 --> 36:56.284
Unless she was your choice.

36:56.352 --> 36:59.220
Did he pick her for you?

37:08.064 --> 37:13.335
They found these photos
of courtney

37:13.402 --> 37:14.736
In howell's house.

37:14.804 --> 37:17.339
Part of the training,
right?

37:20.710 --> 37:23.311

- training?
- Come on. You guys talked sex.

37:23.379 --> 37:25.013
He showed you these pictures
of courtney.

37:25.081 --> 37:28.350
He got you excited.
Didn't he offer her to you?

37:28.417 --> 37:29.618
- What do you mean "offered"?

37:29.685 --> 37:33.755
- Offered you fantasies
of sex and violence.

37:33.823 --> 37:36.057
Some boys in their early teens
make them up.

37:36.125 --> 37:38.927
Elvis knew
that you wanted courtney

37:38.995 --> 37:40.362
And so he used her
to excite you.

37:40.429 --> 37:44.399
- Why the hell
would he do that, huh?

37:44.467 --> 37:49.070
- So that he could gain power
over you.

37:49.138 --> 37:51.806
- No.

37:51.874 --> 37:55.243
No, he wanted me
to be my--my own man.

37:55.311 --> 37:57.545
- Yeah, but the problem is
the man that he wanted

37:57.613 --> 37:59.080
Is not the man that you are.

37:59.148 --> 38:01.549
Here.
Look at these people.

38:01.617 --> 38:04.953
See these people?
You care for these people.

38:05.021 --> 38:07.288
You care
about ernie's problems.

38:07.356 --> 38:09.824
And you care about your son's
ear infections.

38:09.892 --> 38:14.129
Elvis howell
never had the capacity

38:14.196 --> 38:16.965
To feel like that.

38:17.033 --> 38:22.170
Dale, he made a bad choice
in you.

38:22.238 --> 38:27.208
And now with what you've done,
feeling and caring,

38:27.276 --> 38:31.279
That's gonna be
a real burden.

38:31.347 --> 38:33.548
- I'm guilty.
Why are you doing this?

38:42.124 --> 38:47.829
- So that you know
who you really are.

38:47.897 --> 38:52.100
- Maybe I don't want
to know that.

38:55.371 --> 38:59.340
- He tempted you.
He aroused you.

38:59.408 --> 39:03.378
Said you could have her.

39:03.446 --> 39:06.014
That he'd show you how.

39:06.082 --> 39:11.386
- He showed me on a whore

39:11.454 --> 39:13.688
Who cursed
and screamed filth.

39:13.756 --> 39:15.857
The kind that I--I'd heard
from my mother

39:15.925 --> 39:17.625
And the whoremongers
that she brought around.

39:17.693 --> 39:22.397
Filth that I hated.

39:22.465 --> 39:24.632
But the rake handle,
that made that whore silent.

39:28.104 --> 39:33.141
- Did courtney scream filth?
Did courtney scream?

39:33.209 --> 39:37.178
- Yes. She begged.

39:37.246 --> 39:40.949
And pleaded.

39:41.016 --> 39:44.886
But--but when she asked god
to forgive me...

39:47.757 --> 39:50.492
When she said that...

39:50.559 --> 39:54.095
- You couldn't do it.

39:54.163 --> 39:57.265
- Understand...

39:57.333 --> 40:00.869
Elvis alone cared for me,

40:00.936 --> 40:05.874
And I failed.

40:05.941 --> 40:10.678
But I only failed him once.

40:10.746 --> 40:13.448
- Elvis killed courtney.

40:34.637 --> 40:37.872
- What happened next, dale?

40:37.940 --> 40:41.276
- I told him I was sorry.

40:41.343 --> 40:44.445
I showed him.
I put my lips on her stomach.

40:44.513 --> 40:47.282
And I left our mark there.

40:47.349 --> 40:48.750
I swore
I'd never fail him again.

40:48.818 --> 40:51.152
And I haven't.

40:51.220 --> 40:54.889
I haven't.

40:54.957 --> 40:58.159
Until now.

41:16.745 --> 41:22.483
- Detective.

41:22.551 --> 41:25.920
Marcus.

41:25.988 --> 41:28.823
- Before I head back,
I need to know.

41:28.891 --> 41:31.159
- We're okay.

41:31.227 --> 41:33.394
I'll call the gundersons.

41:36.699 --> 41:42.270
- He help us out?
- Yeah, he did.

41:42.338 --> 41:46.273
- I don't know the man,
but thank him for me.

42:00.755 --> 42:03.190
- Things are okay?

42:03.258 --> 42:05.893
- Things are fine.

42:05.960 --> 42:08.629
Thanks.

42:08.696 --> 42:12.432
That's from marcus.

42:12.500 --> 42:14.301
And me.

42:16.538 --> 42:19.540
- I'm just very happy
to have been wrong.
