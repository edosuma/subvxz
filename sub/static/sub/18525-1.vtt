- Hello.
- Hi.

01:34.998 --> 01:35.862

01:35.999 --> 01:38.832
- Welcome home, Vanessa.
- Thank you. It's great to be here.

01:43.473 --> 01:45.907
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi!

01:46.042 --> 01:49.978
I'm excited to be here.
Thank you very much for having me.

01:50.113 --> 01:52.946
- What's the book about?
- It's about me and a town.

01:53.083 --> 01:56.348
- Like here?
- Well, I don't wanna spoil it for you,

01:56.486 --> 01:59.853
but... I will let you in
on one little secret.

01:59.990 --> 02:01.184
There's magic.

02:02.692 --> 02:04.626
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.854
- Yeah? Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

02:06.997 --> 02:09.395
November Christmas.

02:10.233 --> 02:12.997
"A pumpkin patch in August.

02:14.504 --> 02:15.971
"A Christmas tree in fall.

02:16.106 --> 02:19.200
"Wow, how fun.

02:19.342 --> 02:24.279
"The very idea of it would seem impossible
to most eight-year-olds, but not to me.

02:24.414 --> 02:26.177
"I knew that magic was real.

02:27.183 --> 02:30.380
"And it was everywhere,
if you knew where to look.

02:31.354 --> 02:34.653
"My magical adventure
began one ordinary summer morning,

02:34.790 --> 02:38.557
"in a quiet town,
when everyone was still asleep.

02:38.895 --> 02:41.227
Well, almost everyone."

05:08.044 --> 05:10.274
Do you not see what I see?

05:11.880 --> 05:13.610
Crow, will ya?

05:13.750 --> 05:17.117
The sun came up 15 minutes ago.
What are you waitin' for?

05:21.224 --> 05:24.216
- How long have you been standin' there?
- Long enough.

05:27.230 --> 05:29.994
Should I be worried
about you talking to that old bird?

05:30.133 --> 05:31.430
Probably.

05:31.568 --> 05:33.263
- Thanks.
- Wade called.

05:33.403 --> 05:35.462
He's gettin' nervous about his eggs.

05:35.605 --> 05:38.096
- He's always nervous.
- Better get down there.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.607
I'll take 'em over to him.
You need anything in town?

05:40.743 --> 05:42.802
No, I'm on my way into the library.

05:42.946 --> 05:44.607
What do you want for dessert tonight?

05:44.747 --> 05:48.182
Just you. And a fruit pie.

05:48.318 --> 05:51.151
I'll see you later.

05:51.287 --> 05:53.000
Okay.

05:53.523 --> 05:55.047
See ya.

06:04.033 --> 06:06.627
<i>Dr. Perry,</i>
<i>please report to Cardiology.</i>

06:06.836 --> 06:08.861
<i>Dr. Perry, report to Cardiology,</i>
<i>please.</i>

06:09.005 --> 06:10.597
What time is it now?

06:10.740 --> 06:12.401
- It's time for you to sit down.
- Don't give me that face.

06:12.542 --> 06:15.010
Sit down.
We're gonna be out of here really soon.

06:22.318 --> 06:24.343
I'm giving this one to Nurse Angie.

06:24.487 --> 06:26.512
- Oh... she'll love that.
- Hmm.

06:27.957 --> 06:29.185
- Mom?
- Yes, Gordon.

06:29.325 --> 06:31.316
- When's dad coming back?
- Um...

06:31.460 --> 06:33.656
Right now.

06:33.796 --> 06:35.661
<i>Dr. Blade to Oncology, please.</i>
<i>Dr. Blade to Oncology.</i>

06:35.798 --> 06:37.993
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

06:38.968 --> 06:41.368
- Let's go.
- Ah, Vanessa, we have to wait

06:41.504 --> 06:43.665
till Dr. Patel signs your discharge papers.

06:43.806 --> 06:46.707
- How much longer?
- Oh, 10 seconds.

06:47.644 --> 06:50.738
- One, two, three..
- Okay, five minutes.

06:50.880 --> 06:54.376
Hey, Gordo, look what I got you.

06:54.517 --> 06:57.145
- Whoa! Thanks, Dad!
- Yeah, buddy.

06:57.487 --> 06:59.300
And this...

07:00.657 --> 07:02.400
... is for you.

07:03.660 --> 07:05.150
Wow. Thanks.

07:06.262 --> 07:08.423
- You shake it.
- What?

07:08.565 --> 07:10.658
You shake it so you can see the snow.

07:51.574 --> 07:53.041
Good morning, ladies.

07:58.047 --> 08:00.709
Hey, slow down and enjoy the ride!

08:01.884 --> 08:02.873
Idiot.

08:17.233 --> 08:18.598
Coffee break?

08:18.735 --> 08:20.259
- I... I need this.
- I needed you

08:20.403 --> 08:23.270
to be on time this morning.
Let's go, hmm? You're on dishes

08:23.406 --> 08:24.964
this afternoon.
Again?

08:25.742 --> 08:28.506
Boo-hoo. Customers. Go.

08:32.914 --> 08:35.110
He's been asking for you
and he's in a foul mood.

08:35.250 --> 08:36.741
That's a shocker.

08:41.590 --> 08:42.580
Hmm.

08:46.429 --> 08:48.795
- I heard you missed me.
- Yeah...

08:48.930 --> 08:52.094
- Want these in the cooler?
- Yeah, put 'em there where I can get 'em.

08:54.103 --> 08:56.196
My dishwasher didn't show - again.

08:58.474 --> 09:00.669
- Thought people wanted to work.
- Ah...

09:00.810 --> 09:02.505
Where the heck did she go?

09:02.645 --> 09:04.340
Tammy!
If my niece had her way,

09:04.480 --> 09:07.040
mornings would begin at noon.
You hungry?

09:07.183 --> 09:10.016
- No, I..
- Well, grab a muffin before you head out.

09:10.153 --> 09:11.814
Thanks, Wade. I'll see ya.

09:13.356 --> 09:16.553
Nobody likes cold food.
Table six.

09:16.693 --> 09:17.785
Go.

09:20.863 --> 09:23.263
- Whoop.
- That would've not been pretty.

09:23.399 --> 09:24.730
- Sorry.
- Uncle Wade's impossible.

09:24.867 --> 09:27.836
I would've been on time
if he had let me drive the car.

09:27.970 --> 09:30.370
You gotta prove
that you're trustworthy.

09:30.506 --> 09:32.406
- I'm here, I'm working!
- And you gotta show a better attitude.

09:33.543 --> 09:36.478
He's making me stay after my shift
to be the dishwasher - again.

09:39.649 --> 09:42.049
- 'Morning, Tammy.
- Yeah, good morning.

09:43.486 --> 09:46.512
- Excuse me.
- How are you this morning, Mr. Zachary?

09:46.656 --> 09:49.352
Busy. Gotta unblock
the Richters' kitchen sink,

09:49.492 --> 09:50.891
repair the netting

09:51.027 --> 09:53.860
on the Hammonds' screen door
and build a hutch for a pet rabbit.

09:53.996 --> 09:56.021
Thank goodness for
these helpless city folk moving in.

09:56.165 --> 09:57.792
- Thank you.
- Can I get a muffin?

09:57.934 --> 09:59.492
Yeah, sure thing.

10:06.342 --> 10:08.276
Just lookin'.

10:17.854 --> 10:19.344
It's your turn, Gordon.

10:21.390 --> 10:22.483
I spy...

10:24.527 --> 10:26.119
... Vanessa sleeping.

10:26.262 --> 10:28.321
Boo, I'm awake.

10:34.470 --> 10:36.028
Homeward bound.

10:41.377 --> 10:43.572
- Mom?
- Yeah, sweetie.

10:43.713 --> 10:45.908
The little girl inside the snow globe,

10:46.048 --> 10:48.608
she's holding another snow globe
in her hands.

10:48.750 --> 10:51.379
- Really?
- And it looks like...

10:52.220 --> 10:54.553
... there's another little girl
inside that one.

10:55.090 --> 10:57.082
I didn't notice that.
That's pretty cool.

10:57.226 --> 10:59.854
But it's too small
and I can't really see it.

10:59.996 --> 11:01.725
Can I see?

11:04.400 --> 11:06.231
Pretty cool.
Hmm.

11:34.263 --> 11:36.322
- Feels good to be home, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

11:36.599 --> 11:38.965
Do you need me to help you
unpack your backpack, sweetheart?

11:39.100 --> 11:40.090
I'm okay.

13:00.516 --> 13:01.505
Okay.

13:08.190 --> 13:09.179
Shhh.

13:42.058 --> 13:45.391
It's from the school. We have
to register Vanessa for third grade.

13:48.397 --> 13:51.889
- There's nothing in there.
- Nothing eatable, as Gordon would say.

13:55.237 --> 13:56.761
Rice cakes and anchovies.

13:56.906 --> 13:59.773
- Yuck, as our daughter would say.
- What do I say?

14:00.409 --> 14:03.139
Look at what your daddy
is thinking about eating.

14:03.279 --> 14:05.304
- Yuck.
- It is yuck.

14:05.448 --> 14:07.643
- What are we gonna do today?
- We're gonna take it easy,

14:07.783 --> 14:09.444
since we spent the morning in the car.

14:09.585 --> 14:11.246
Why can't we do something?

14:11.920 --> 14:15.652
- Let's you and I go shopping for mommy.
- I want her to take it easy.

14:16.592 --> 14:18.958
- Can I get a toy?!
- Oh...

14:19.095 --> 14:21.393
- How does he do that?
- I already got you a toy, buddy!

14:21.530 --> 14:24.397
- Just me and dad, Gordon!
- Dad and me.

14:24.533 --> 14:26.125
- And let's not yell.
- Why can't I come?

14:26.268 --> 14:28.702
- Do you see what you've started?
- It's back to normal.

14:28.838 --> 14:31.102
Hey, munchkins,
come on, let's go, in the car.

14:33.776 --> 14:36.939
Maybe with us outta your hair,
you can do a little something for you.

14:39.615 --> 14:41.105
We're gonna be okay.

14:51.627 --> 14:54.187
- How's it going?
- Good.

14:54.330 --> 14:56.696
We have all the books in, except
for one on the fourth grade list,

14:56.832 --> 14:59.323
and that'll be here next week.
Fantastic.

14:59.468 --> 15:01.459
And... a new illustration.

15:02.805 --> 15:05.968
And check out the books
in the Fall and Winter Reading Series.

15:06.409 --> 15:08.502
I used all you book suggestions.

15:08.644 --> 15:09.838
I see.

15:09.979 --> 15:12.914
Claire... I want you to run it.

15:13.049 --> 15:16.041
Oh, no, Abby,
I said I would do it for the summer,

15:16.185 --> 15:17.880
but..
Come on, you love it.

15:18.020 --> 15:20.113
- I do.
- And I wanna add another group,

15:20.256 --> 15:22.622
so with scheduling
and overseeing the readers.

15:22.758 --> 15:25.192
I'll need you here one more day.

15:25.327 --> 15:28.125
That would be three days a week
away from the farm.

15:31.167 --> 15:32.532
Ah, I'll talk to Jess.

15:32.668 --> 15:34.659
Sure. Thanks.

15:51.187 --> 15:52.347
Dad?

15:53.689 --> 15:55.949
- Dad.
- Yeah, Gordo.

15:56.092 --> 15:58.652
- I'm gonna be Batman for Halloween.
- Well,

15:58.794 --> 16:01.126
you outgrew that costume.
But I wanna be Batman.

16:01.263 --> 16:05.199
Okay, I guess we'll just have
to get a new one when the time comes.

16:05.868 --> 16:08.860
- When will that be?
- Oh, not for a while.

16:09.370 --> 16:10.360
- Why?

16:10.773 --> 16:12.104
- Well, it's only August.

16:12.240 --> 16:15.267
- When's Halloween?
- End of October.

16:15.410 --> 16:18.107
- How long's that?
- That's a couple of months.

16:18.247 --> 16:21.705
- How long's a couple of months?
- That's 60 days, buddy.

16:51.747 --> 16:53.476
Hey, honey.
Hey.

16:56.585 --> 16:58.052
Miss Sunshine, you okay?

16:58.754 --> 17:00.244
- Mm-hmm.
- You sure?

17:02.090 --> 17:04.355
You want me to take you home
so you can rest?

17:04.492 --> 17:05.790
We can get our vegetables later.

17:05.928 --> 17:07.589
- Tomorrow.
- No, I'm okay.

17:07.930 --> 17:09.727
Let's go!

17:18.507 --> 17:21.101
Hello, Tom. Good to see ya.

17:22.278 --> 17:24.178
- You, too.
- Kids, say hi to Mr. Sanford.

17:24.313 --> 17:25.678
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:27.817 --> 17:30.911
- Can we go see the animals?
- If it's okay with Mr. Sanford.

17:31.053 --> 17:32.800
Sure you can.

17:35.790 --> 17:37.281
Careful where you step.

17:38.460 --> 17:41.361
How long have you been livin' out here?
Mm, seven...

17:41.497 --> 17:43.089
eight months. Why?

17:43.232 --> 17:45.962
Mr. Sanford was my dad.

17:46.302 --> 17:47.667
Call me Jess.

18:00.749 --> 18:02.478
Kids are sure growin'.

18:03.986 --> 18:06.147
Ah... yep. Happened fast.

18:06.989 --> 18:07.978
Yeah.

18:08.590 --> 18:10.684
- Tomatoes on your list?
- They are.

18:10.826 --> 18:11.815
Four.

18:20.002 --> 18:21.833
That's good. Let's make it six.

18:23.005 --> 18:24.495
Kids like corn?

18:24.840 --> 18:28.332
Sure. So do I.
It's on the list: six ears.

18:30.179 --> 18:32.010
Haven't seen much of you folks.

18:33.682 --> 18:35.707
Been gettin' your vegetables
someplace else?

18:36.518 --> 18:38.008
No, we, uh...

18:38.687 --> 18:40.177
We just been busy.

18:41.690 --> 18:43.988
Well... busy's good.

18:44.126 --> 18:46.026
Beats the alternative.

18:47.196 --> 18:49.027
Uh... excuse me.

18:50.866 --> 18:51.855
Hey.

18:52.868 --> 18:55.359
Yeah, yeah, I, uh... I got the disk.

18:58.707 --> 19:01.073
And... I'm gonna write the programme,
so...

19:03.545 --> 19:05.604
C'mere. Sit, sit.

19:05.748 --> 19:08.546
Sit. Sit.
What's his name?

19:09.550 --> 19:10.745
His name's Stanley.

19:10.886 --> 19:12.444
Good boy.

19:12.588 --> 19:15.386
No, no, no, I was planning
on being there, but now I, uh...

19:15.990 --> 19:17.583
I can't make it.

19:17.726 --> 19:19.717
Look, just call me
after the meeting's over.

19:21.330 --> 19:22.422
Okay, bye.

19:22.564 --> 19:24.896
Would like to...

20:11.613 --> 20:13.103
Could I return these?

20:17.453 --> 20:18.317
Beth.

20:19.455 --> 20:22.618
- Hi, Claire.
- Hi. I haven't seen you all summer.

20:23.459 --> 20:24.653
- Everybody good?
- Everybody's great.

20:24.793 --> 20:27.956
Yeah, we've just been
in and out of town. Mm.

20:28.464 --> 20:31.627
Y'know, we're gonna continue
the preschool reading series in the fall.

20:31.967 --> 20:33.958
Gordon might really enjoy it.

20:36.305 --> 20:37.465
Found it.

20:38.307 --> 20:40.969
I'll keep it in mind.
It was nice seeing you.

20:41.110 --> 20:43.305
You, too. Tell Tom and the kids hi.

20:43.812 --> 20:44.801
Beth.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.608
- Hi.
- Megan's mom.

20:47.750 --> 20:48.910
Rita.

20:49.050 --> 20:52.953
Right. I'm sorry. Of course. It's...
There's just been a lot going on.

20:53.088 --> 20:55.784
Ugh, tell me about it.
Summer camps, family stuff,

20:55.924 --> 20:58.984
kids getting ready to go back to school...
Yeah, right.

20:59.828 --> 21:01.056
How's your daughter?

21:03.832 --> 21:05.561
Forgive me, I'm only asking

21:05.700 --> 21:07.032
because..
It's okay.

21:07.169 --> 21:09.501
She's, uh... she's doing much better.

21:10.339 --> 21:12.068
It's nice seeing you.

21:22.418 --> 21:23.976
Yeah, I'll take two orders to go.

21:24.119 --> 21:25.347
- All right.
- Thanks.

21:33.529 --> 21:34.723
There's nobody here!

21:36.532 --> 21:37.521
Yeah...

21:54.716 --> 21:56.377
<i>How's your tummy feel now?</i>

21:57.386 --> 21:58.717
<i>Okay.</i>

21:59.720 --> 22:03.420
<i>- Yeah? Come here.</i>
- When am I gonna get better?

22:04.226 --> 22:07.059
- Soon.
- How long is soon?

22:12.734 --> 22:15.635
Do you remember when we planted
those flowers in the backyard?

22:17.072 --> 22:18.403
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

22:19.408 --> 22:22.571
Remember they were very healthy
when we first planted them?

22:23.912 --> 22:25.743
But after some time, they...

22:26.715 --> 22:27.704
... wilted.

22:28.250 --> 22:31.151
So we cut them back and...

22:31.286 --> 22:34.778
you don't know this, but your daddy
gave them some plant food

22:34.923 --> 22:38.757
to prepare them for the winter
so that they could grow healthy again.

22:39.260 --> 22:40.785
It's just like that.

22:41.763 --> 22:45.699
Dr. Patel gives you medicine
that sometimes makes you feel bad,

22:45.834 --> 22:47.426
but it's so you'll get better.

22:48.103 --> 22:48.967
Okay?

22:49.104 --> 22:50.662
By Halloween?

22:51.440 --> 22:52.600
Maybe.

22:53.108 --> 22:54.837
But probably more like Christmas.

22:55.444 --> 22:57.844
That's not for... forever.

22:57.980 --> 23:00.949
Hey, now... don't say that.

23:04.119 --> 23:08.419
Let's just say you'll be better by
the time we have our first big snowfall.

23:08.957 --> 23:09.946
Okay?

23:14.963 --> 23:17.454
- Want your covers all the way up?
- Sure.

23:18.467 --> 23:20.492
Snug as a bug in a rug.

23:20.636 --> 23:23.794
- Love you.
- I love you, too, sweetheart.

23:41.990 --> 23:43.355
What do you say, Tom?

23:44.326 --> 23:45.315
Jess.

23:46.160 --> 23:49.854
- Do you have any pumpkins?
- Pumpkins?

23:49.998 --> 23:51.488
No, too early.

23:52.167 --> 23:54.863
Got a lot of squash.
Got some nice zucchini.

23:56.004 --> 23:57.869
How long will it be
before you have pumpkins?

23:58.006 --> 24:01.533
Ah, nobody around here's gonna have any
pumpkins till the first part of October.

24:03.010 --> 24:06.310
Been too cool and dry this summer.
Maybe down in New York

24:06.448 --> 24:08.245
and New Jersey, but not around here.

24:10.552 --> 24:12.247
I'll have lots of 'em by Halloween.

24:12.854 --> 24:14.515
Right. Okay.

24:15.557 --> 24:16.888
Thanks, Jess.

24:17.559 --> 24:18.548
Sure.

24:23.398 --> 24:26.890
- What was that all about?
- I got no idea.

24:37.246 --> 24:40.806
- Oh. We expecting company?
- No. Why?

24:41.583 --> 24:43.073
You made a pot roast...

24:43.585 --> 24:46.076
It's Monday night...
I was in the mood.

24:46.922 --> 24:48.082
Lucky me.

24:49.590 --> 24:51.786
- Mm. Apple?
- Yep.

24:52.760 --> 24:53.659
Yum.

24:56.430 --> 24:58.592
That old dog sure sleeps a lot.

24:58.734 --> 25:00.668
Suppose he's got a thyroid problem?

25:00.802 --> 25:02.895
Oh, he's okay, he's just old.

25:04.106 --> 25:05.903
That what you say about me?

25:06.608 --> 25:07.973
You don't sleep that much.

25:09.278 --> 25:11.007
It's all that pie you feed me.

25:16.285 --> 25:17.650
So what's up?

25:18.287 --> 25:20.721
Abby wants to continue
the children's reading series

25:20.856 --> 25:23.051
into the school year.
She wants me

25:23.190 --> 25:26.422
to run it.
It'd mean an extra day each week

25:26.560 --> 25:28.290
at the library, but...

25:28.430 --> 25:30.660
I'm thinking of saying yes.

25:31.967 --> 25:33.161
Do it.

25:34.136 --> 25:35.797
I mean, you enjoy being there.

25:36.470 --> 25:39.497
You're great with the kids.
Y'know, they're lucky to have you.

25:44.313 --> 25:45.803
I saw Beth Marks.

25:46.480 --> 25:49.143
- She came by the library.
- Really?

25:49.985 --> 25:52.818
Tom and the kids stopped by
the stand the other day.

25:53.322 --> 25:54.846
He's an odd one.

25:54.990 --> 25:57.151
He's not odd, he's just young.

25:57.292 --> 26:00.193
He came back again today
lookin' for pumpkins.

26:00.329 --> 26:01.819
In August. That's odd.

26:52.547 --> 26:55.414
Can we keep the light on
and my door open a crack?

26:55.550 --> 26:57.074
Of course, sweetheart.

26:57.219 --> 27:00.086
And you just call out
if you need anything, okay?

27:00.222 --> 27:01.382
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:02.890 --> 27:04.552
- I love you. Good night.
- Good night.

27:05.727 --> 27:06.887
'Night.

27:17.406 --> 27:19.897
I think we should reregister Vanessa
for school.

27:20.575 --> 27:23.009
Her immune system's too weak
to be around other kids.

27:23.145 --> 27:25.636
- Honey, you're just being--
- Don't make this about me, Tom.

27:27.749 --> 27:30.684
Well, we can't keep her in a cocoon.
Eventually, she's gotta go school.

27:30.819 --> 27:32.980
She needs to get well first.

27:33.922 --> 27:35.412
She's gonna get well.

27:35.924 --> 27:39.052
I just... I don't think we should
making any set plans right now.

27:39.194 --> 27:42.322
- That's exactly what we need to do.
- I don't think you're being realistic.

27:42.464 --> 27:44.398
But we moved here
because of the schools.

27:44.533 --> 27:47.832
What would it hurt to meet the teacher,
let Vanessa see the classroom.

27:47.969 --> 27:50.961
No. No, we're not doing that.
It's too much pressure.

27:51.940 --> 27:54.306
I don't want her feeling badly
that she can't be around

27:54.443 --> 27:57.970
the other kids again.
I'm homeschooling her this year.

27:58.113 --> 28:00.104
And, please, stop pushing me.

28:11.159 --> 28:12.148
Sorry.

28:14.796 --> 28:16.821
Hey. Sorry.

28:16.965 --> 28:18.626
Okay. Me, too.

28:31.813 --> 28:33.644
Why couldn't it have been me?

28:46.294 --> 28:48.159
So what are we gonna do today?

28:48.630 --> 28:50.120
We can watch a video.

28:52.133 --> 28:53.760
Okay. You wanna play a board game?

28:53.902 --> 28:56.336
We could do that.
Why do we have to stay inside?

28:56.470 --> 28:57.961
It's not raining anymore.

28:58.473 --> 29:00.703
- Can we go swimming?
- Can we?

29:02.477 --> 29:05.071
- We still have that wading pool, don't we?
- Mm-hmm.

29:05.213 --> 29:08.114
- Hmm?
- It's for babies. Can't we go swimming?

29:08.250 --> 29:10.115
- No, we cannot go swimming.

29:10.652 --> 29:12.882
We don't have to go swimming
to have a good time.

29:13.020 --> 29:15.512
When I come back from my meeting,
we can get outta here.

29:19.394 --> 29:21.658
There's one.
There's one right there.

29:21.796 --> 29:22.854
Oh!

29:22.998 --> 29:25.159
- Look at him crawling.
- Is that a baby?

29:25.300 --> 29:27.530
- I think it might be a baby, yeah.

29:27.669 --> 29:29.500
- Where's the mommy?
- I don't know.

29:30.338 --> 29:32.499
Maybe if we're lucky
we'll get to see her.

29:33.775 --> 29:36.005
- Oh! Is that her?
- Yep.

29:36.845 --> 29:39.040
I think that's her right there.
Is that the mommy?

29:39.180 --> 29:41.273
Careful, careful. Watch your toes.

29:41.416 --> 29:43.145
- Oh...
- Watch your... watch your toes.

29:43.285 --> 29:45.082
Go on! Yeah!
Now lift her up real high!

29:45.220 --> 29:47.017
There you go! Yeah, that's it!

29:48.023 --> 29:49.684
Get that thing going, buddy!

29:49.824 --> 29:52.349
All right, let's go.

29:54.195 --> 29:55.856
Good! Whoo!

29:58.867 --> 30:00.232
Whoo.

30:00.368 --> 30:02.598
- Yeah!
- That's it! Faster, buddy! Faster!

30:02.737 --> 30:05.399
Yeah! Keep going, buddy! Faster!

30:05.540 --> 30:07.007
That's it! Yeah!

30:07.142 --> 30:10.236
Let Vanessa have a try.
Hey, Gordon, let Vanessa try.

30:11.046 --> 30:12.604
- Yeah!
- There you go, sweetie.

30:12.747 --> 30:14.408
Now come on..
Go, honey, go!

30:14.549 --> 30:16.073
Run, let's go.

30:16.217 --> 30:18.515
- Oh, yeah!
- Whoo!

30:18.653 --> 30:20.211
- All right.

30:23.592 --> 30:25.924
All right! Yeah!

30:28.396 --> 30:30.261
Hey, slow down.

30:30.398 --> 30:31.490
Easy, buddy.

30:31.633 --> 30:33.567
- Who wants a topper?
- Me!

30:34.235 --> 30:35.725
Of course.

30:37.238 --> 30:40.401
- Hey, hey, hey, sweetie, where you going?
- Oh, it's okay.

30:50.485 --> 30:52.248
I have that book.

30:53.755 --> 30:55.882
Uh... it's a really good book.

30:56.590 --> 30:59.583
I know it by heart.
And I have the same colour pencils.

31:01.429 --> 31:02.418
Cool.

31:04.265 --> 31:06.631
- Do you like drawing?
- Mm-hmm.

31:06.768 --> 31:08.599
I draw animals and people.

31:08.737 --> 31:10.602
Sometimes they come out funny.

31:12.607 --> 31:15.075
Uh... this is supposed to be a possum.

31:17.479 --> 31:19.640
Do you think you could help me
with this?

31:19.780 --> 31:22.648
I only saw one possum
in my whole life.

31:24.285 --> 31:26.116
But I sorta remember.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.290
You're really good.

31:42.137 --> 31:43.331
What's your name?

31:44.472 --> 31:45.769
Vanessa.

31:45.907 --> 31:47.135
I'm Tammy.

31:48.309 --> 31:50.709
- Did you just move here?
- Five months ago.

31:53.314 --> 31:55.908
- Do you... read a lot?
- Mm-hmm.

31:56.050 --> 31:58.315
It's my favourite thing.
And drawing.

32:00.155 --> 32:01.952
I'm thinking about writing a book.

32:02.990 --> 32:04.322
That'd be good.

32:05.860 --> 32:07.350
With a possum?

32:15.670 --> 32:17.535
Tom, can you call them again?

32:17.672 --> 32:20.004
Guys, breakfast! Let's go!

32:24.679 --> 32:25.668
Guys!

32:36.024 --> 32:37.082
Dad.

32:41.529 --> 32:42.996
No fever, no worries.

32:43.130 --> 32:45.599
We've been overdoing it.
I knew we should've kept her at home.

32:45.734 --> 32:48.567
- Beth.
- I'm an idiot, thinking everything is okay.

32:48.703 --> 32:50.568
Everything <i>is</i> okay.

32:50.705 --> 32:52.605
I'm calling the doctor.

32:54.375 --> 32:55.603
It's okay.

32:55.744 --> 33:00.704
You just have to get some rest,
then you're gonna be good to go.

33:02.383 --> 33:03.680
Okay.

33:54.269 --> 33:55.429
Sorry!

34:23.130 --> 34:25.292
- Hi, hon. How's she doing?
<i>- Hi.</i>

34:25.433 --> 34:28.596
So she went right back to bed
after she finished her lunch.

34:29.637 --> 34:32.606
And I talked Dr. Patel again
and she said she didn't need to see her.

34:32.739 --> 34:36.038
Well, the doctor would've has us
<i>bring her in if she had a fever.</i>

34:36.177 --> 34:38.610
Well, I think I should've insisted
that I bring her in.

34:38.746 --> 34:41.510
She...
she's got an appointment next week.

34:42.317 --> 34:43.909
<i>Get all her levels checked</i>

34:44.052 --> 34:46.714
and you'll see, they'll be good.
You were right, we overdid it.

34:46.855 --> 34:49.688
Okay. I gotta go.

34:49.824 --> 34:52.322
- I'm almost home.
- Okay.

36:00.060 --> 36:03.224
Don't see you for a month
and now it's three times in one week.

36:04.732 --> 36:06.927
Sorry, I probably...
should've called first.

36:07.068 --> 36:08.968
I probably wouldn't have answered.

36:13.074 --> 36:16.242
- Sure is peaceful out here.
- Yes, it is.

36:19.414 --> 36:22.212
Say, would it be possible
for me to choose a Christmas tree?

36:22.917 --> 36:25.647
No, we don't tag trees
till mid-November.

36:26.587 --> 36:30.747
Sorta like hangin' on to these...
long summer days.

36:31.426 --> 36:33.656
If I could stop time,
I'd stop it right now.

36:37.598 --> 36:40.260
- November for tree tagging.
- Right.

36:42.103 --> 36:43.968
- Thanks.
- Sure.

37:10.965 --> 37:12.592
I know what Tom's up to.

37:13.634 --> 37:15.261
- Tom who?
- Marks.

37:16.637 --> 37:17.968
Beth's husband.

37:20.475 --> 37:22.306
That little girl of theirs is sick.

37:24.312 --> 37:26.109
He's movin' up the clock.

37:27.148 --> 37:30.241
- What does that mean?
- He's pushin' everything forward.

37:30.385 --> 37:33.684
He's... he's looking for pumpkins
and Christmas trees

37:33.820 --> 37:35.311
in the middle of summer.

37:37.658 --> 37:40.650
He's gonna make sure
she has a Halloween or a Christmas.

37:42.663 --> 37:44.654
Did he say something to you?

37:46.334 --> 37:47.824
It's what he's not sayin'.

38:18.533 --> 38:20.023
I need your help, Teddy.

38:24.539 --> 38:27.030
My neighbour's little girl
is really sick.

38:30.710 --> 38:32.338
What do you want from me?

38:33.214 --> 38:34.272
Pumpkins.

38:34.415 --> 38:36.212
Your nephew still grow 'em?

38:40.888 --> 38:43.721
We sold a lot of melons and apples
down this way.

38:53.400 --> 38:55.392
You believe what they're sayin' about...

38:56.070 --> 38:58.197
... winter comin'
in the middle of October?

38:59.574 --> 39:01.542
Pfft.
Well, the thing about the weather is,

39:01.676 --> 39:04.702
not matter what's predicted,
we find out soon enough if it's true.

39:10.418 --> 39:11.817
I'm sorry, Teddy.

39:15.590 --> 39:17.421
Should've said it a long time ago.

39:22.096 --> 39:23.586
When Stevie died...

39:25.266 --> 39:27.496
... we just couldn't get up from it.

39:31.772 --> 39:33.262
Then you lost Ellen.

39:35.109 --> 39:36.633
And I wasn't there for ya.

39:42.450 --> 39:45.112
Claire and I loved her dearly,
you know that.

39:49.157 --> 39:52.786
I'd like to think Ellen'd... understand.

39:54.128 --> 39:56.653
And if she would, maybe you could too.

40:01.969 --> 40:04.130
This whole thing between us has...

40:05.139 --> 40:06.970
... gone on for too long.

40:11.879 --> 40:13.471
I've been really stupid.

40:18.653 --> 40:20.143
Yeah, well, we, uh...

40:21.656 --> 40:23.385
... we both been through a lot.

40:32.333 --> 40:33.823
We're okay, then?

40:37.170 --> 40:38.399
We're okay.

41:09.837 --> 41:12.533
- There you go. Go it?
- Got it.

41:18.379 --> 41:21.041
- There you go.
- Yeah, there's a couple of beauties.

41:24.552 --> 41:28.249
Rick! Tell your uncle and Mr. Sanford
that they're stayin' for dinner!

41:29.223 --> 41:31.054
If Lily's isn't happy, no one here is.

41:32.226 --> 41:34.694
I've never turned a free meal down yet.
Thanks.

41:59.253 --> 42:00.743
What are you workin' on?

42:02.089 --> 42:04.080
Uh... the great American novel.

42:05.760 --> 42:07.387
For kids under seven.

42:08.929 --> 42:12.330
- How's it going?
- Uh... would it be too cliché

42:12.466 --> 42:14.457
to say I have writer's block?

42:14.602 --> 42:16.331
Doesn't look like it
from where I sit.

42:23.610 --> 42:25.602
You know,
if you're into kids books...

42:26.447 --> 42:30.076
we could use some help with the preschool
reading series at the library.

42:30.950 --> 42:33.943
- If you have some free time.
- Yeah, maybe.

42:34.789 --> 42:35.778
Great.

42:41.662 --> 42:45.689
- Lily, that meal was fantastic.
- Mm. I'm glad you enjoyed it.

42:46.634 --> 42:50.001
- Susie, I'm so happy you were able to join us.
- Well, thanks for inviting me.

42:50.970 --> 42:54.338
- Susie lives close by.
- Mm. I live 10 minutes away in town.

42:55.142 --> 42:59.010
- She's got family in Sullivan.
- My first cousin, Laura Booker.

42:59.146 --> 43:01.842
I know her husband.
Used to play ball with him.

43:01.982 --> 43:03.813
- Hmm.
- You get up to Sullivan often?

43:04.485 --> 43:06.350
- Well, Ted comes down here mostly.

43:08.122 --> 43:09.384
- Ah...
- Hmm.

43:10.658 --> 43:12.182
Maybe we should be going soon.

43:12.326 --> 43:15.352
- Well, why don't you guys just stay over?
- We've got the room.

43:17.330 --> 43:19.390
Well, you won't have to twist my arm.

43:19.533 --> 43:22.297
Just gonna have to call my wife
and let her know I won't be home.

43:22.436 --> 43:24.734
Good for me.

43:37.685 --> 43:39.346
Not too late to drive home.

43:45.860 --> 43:47.350
I like Susie.

43:49.029 --> 43:50.018
Me, too.

43:51.030 --> 43:52.521
And she likes you.

43:54.034 --> 43:55.194
I know.

43:56.203 --> 43:58.899
I can't imagine
how I managed to be so lucky.

43:59.707 --> 44:02.175
Twice now.
Well, I can.

44:04.210 --> 44:07.203
- I wasn't sure what you'd think.
- I think it's great.

44:09.550 --> 44:11.745
Ellen would've wanted you
to be happy.

44:20.528 --> 44:22.359
<i>Oh Susie Q</i>

44:24.698 --> 44:27.189
<i>Oh Susie Q</i>

44:27.868 --> 44:29.961
<i>- Oh Susie Q</i>
- Enough.

44:30.104 --> 44:33.369
<i>Baby I love you Susie Q</i>

44:58.232 --> 44:59.392
Hey, Gordon.

45:03.470 --> 45:04.460
What's up?

45:06.073 --> 45:07.631
Am I gonna get sick?

45:08.742 --> 45:11.404
- What?
- Am I gonna get sick?

45:12.413 --> 45:13.402
No.

45:14.482 --> 45:15.847
Why's Nessa sick?

45:19.253 --> 45:20.413
Well... uh...

45:21.255 --> 45:23.086
I don't know, sweetie. That's...

45:24.090 --> 45:26.525
... one of those questions
we don't know the answer to.

45:27.094 --> 45:30.120
Like if there are other little girls
in Vanessa's ball?

45:30.764 --> 45:32.493
In Vanessa's snow globe?

45:34.435 --> 45:37.768
Vanessa tries to see
how many little girls are in there.

45:39.106 --> 45:40.937
She says we'll never know.

45:42.943 --> 45:44.808
Well, yeah, Vanessa's right.

45:44.945 --> 45:48.437
That's another one of those questions
we'll know the answer to.

45:53.287 --> 45:55.118
- But you know what?
- What?

45:56.123 --> 46:00.617
Your sister is very tough and she's
teaching us all how to be strong.

46:01.160 --> 46:02.685
I'm strong.

46:03.464 --> 46:04.453
Yeah.

46:05.132 --> 46:07.794
You are the strongest little man
that I know.

46:07.935 --> 46:09.903
Tom! Gordon!

46:10.037 --> 46:12.232
Get down here!
Come on.

46:16.710 --> 46:18.678
Oh! Look at all the pumpkins!

46:18.812 --> 46:21.076
- Oh!
- Wow!

46:23.584 --> 46:26.212
- Are these all for us?
- Well, read the note, honey.

46:31.992 --> 46:36.587
"What do you know,
found a few ripe ones. Jess Sanford."

46:36.730 --> 46:38.925
Whoa! There's gazillions of 'em!

46:39.066 --> 46:42.229
- What are we gonna do with all of 'em?!
- Uh, well, we're gonna decide

46:42.369 --> 46:44.462
after the two of you get dressed.
Go on.

46:44.605 --> 46:46.402
Go up and change your clothes.

46:46.540 --> 46:48.906
Mommy rules.
C'mon, go upstairs and change.

46:54.515 --> 46:56.779
What did you say to Jess
to get him to bring you

46:56.917 --> 46:59.647
an entire pumpkin patch?
Nothin'.

46:59.787 --> 47:01.652
I just asked when he'd have some.

47:02.022 --> 47:03.853
What are we gonna do with all of these?

47:04.858 --> 47:06.792
Let's have an early Halloween.

47:08.362 --> 47:10.125
But it's August, Tom.

47:10.264 --> 47:13.563
I know, but we have pumpkins.
Let's... let's throw a Halloween party.

47:13.700 --> 47:16.761
It'd be great. Turn the living room
into a ghost house.

47:16.904 --> 47:20.670
- Vanessa, we're having a Halloween party!
- Gordon, what did we say

47:20.808 --> 47:23.106
about listening in
on our conversations?

47:23.243 --> 47:25.734
Come on, go upstairs and change,
buddy. Hurry up.

47:30.250 --> 47:31.911
Are you serious about this?

47:34.254 --> 47:35.744
Let's move up the holidays.

47:37.257 --> 47:40.749
Move up Halloween,
then the next holiday, then the next.

47:40.894 --> 47:44.421
As many as we can give her
for however long.

47:48.102 --> 47:49.091
What?

47:50.270 --> 47:54.263
All this time you've been cheering us on
and you don't believe any of it.

47:55.442 --> 47:57.171
You don't think she's gonna make it.

48:01.280 --> 48:02.771
Look at me.

48:04.785 --> 48:08.448
What's wrong with creating a little
happiness for our daughter right now?

48:11.125 --> 48:12.956
I just want her to be happy.

48:30.978 --> 48:32.275
"Our neighbour, Mr. Sanford,

48:32.413 --> 48:35.712
"had planted pumpkin seeds
that magically grew during the night.

48:35.849 --> 48:40.013
"There were big ones and small ones,
orangey ones and yellowy ones.

48:40.154 --> 48:45.083
"I was the luckiest girl in the world
and Gordon was the luckiest boy.

48:45.225 --> 48:49.662
"We were off to our neighbour's farm
to thank him got helping us get pumpkins

48:49.797 --> 48:52.493
for a special early Halloween
just for us."

48:54.835 --> 48:57.326
- We made these for you.
- Well, thank you, Vanessa.

48:58.338 --> 48:59.896
Pink cookies are my favourite.

49:00.040 --> 49:02.907
They're strawberry.
They're dad's favourite, too.

49:03.844 --> 49:08.042
We're having a Halloween party.
I'm gonna be a cowboy. Right, Dad?

49:08.182 --> 49:11.015
- That's right, bud.
- And I'm gonna be a princess.

49:11.150 --> 49:14.018
Well, that wouldn't be much different
from what you are every day, would it?

49:15.689 --> 49:18.021
- I'll be turtle!
- Turtle?

49:19.026 --> 49:20.789
- Good choice.
- Um, yeah,

49:20.928 --> 49:22.793
you're not the one
who has to make the costume.

49:26.900 --> 49:30.097
You wanna go see the geese, go ahead.

49:31.939 --> 49:33.702
Come on, Stanley.

49:35.976 --> 49:37.068
Look at the geese!

49:37.210 --> 49:39.736
- I still don't know how you did it.
- Come on, over here.

49:39.880 --> 49:43.247
- But I owe ya.
- I've been paid, Tom.

49:44.718 --> 49:45.844
Thank you.

49:46.553 --> 49:47.781
Thank <i>you.</i>

49:47.920 --> 49:49.513
Here, boy.

49:51.959 --> 49:54.291
- Gordon?
- It's okay, Mom!

49:54.428 --> 49:56.259
Stanley's my friend!

50:02.402 --> 50:03.391
Hey.

50:03.904 --> 50:05.098
Hey.

50:05.239 --> 50:09.107
Some women get diamonds...
you shower me with pumpkins.

50:09.243 --> 50:10.767
Got a bit carried away.

50:14.748 --> 50:18.240
They're throwin' themselves
a Halloween party Thursday night.

50:24.758 --> 50:26.316
You were right.

51:30.824 --> 51:32.815
What were you doing up there, Jess?

51:33.327 --> 51:34.885
They're not his things.

51:35.329 --> 51:36.956
Just Halloween stuff.

51:39.833 --> 51:43.200
Y'know, I wonder if I would've thought
about doin' somethin' like this for Stevie

51:43.337 --> 51:44.827
if I'd had a chance.

52:04.858 --> 52:07.224
Get away!

52:12.866 --> 52:14.697
About time.

52:15.702 --> 52:18.702
All right, you kids, pack it up!

52:20.107 --> 52:21.404
Ah!

52:31.150 --> 52:32.243
Ah!

52:32.386 --> 52:34.183
No! Get off!

52:34.320 --> 52:36.881
What part of "quit"
do you rascals not understand?!

52:43.897 --> 52:46.923
I got wrangled into babysittin'
my nephew's kids for the mornin'.

52:47.067 --> 52:48.227
I see.

52:49.236 --> 52:52.399
I brought you a little reward
for your 400-mile drive.

52:55.409 --> 52:56.899
- Pumpkin?
- Good guess.

52:57.644 --> 53:00.736
- You get 'em all delivered?
- I got 'em delivered.

53:01.748 --> 53:03.716
They're plannin' on
havin' a Halloween party.

53:04.750 --> 53:07.242
I'm takin' some stuff over there now.

53:10.824 --> 53:12.086
What's that look?

53:14.594 --> 53:16.824
I get it, Jess.
I know what you're doin'.

53:17.930 --> 53:19.922
'Cause you're gettin' real
involved here.

53:21.600 --> 53:24.126
I just hate seeing you
go down that road again.

53:25.272 --> 53:27.934
That road
is always gonna be there, Ted.

53:29.109 --> 53:31.600
And there'll be times
when I'm gonna go down it.

53:32.612 --> 53:35.604
So will Claire.
That's just the way it is.

53:38.785 --> 53:41.777
But if I can put a smile
on that family's face...

53:42.289 --> 53:43.779
I'm gonna do it.

53:44.958 --> 53:46.619
And that's the way that is.

53:51.465 --> 53:52.625
How's Susie?

53:55.302 --> 53:56.769
She's good, thanks.

53:56.903 --> 53:58.165
Good.

54:14.988 --> 54:15.977
Ahem.

54:18.658 --> 54:20.489
- What do you say, Tom?
- Jess!

54:21.828 --> 54:24.592
- What's all this?
- Some old Halloween stuff out of our attic.

54:24.730 --> 54:26.562
Got a little more in the truck.

54:26.700 --> 54:28.861
It's yours if you want it.

54:29.002 --> 54:32.904
Ah... Sure. Thanks.
Uh... you want a cup of coffee?

54:33.507 --> 54:35.668
- Yeah, coffee'd be good.
- Okay.

54:38.712 --> 54:41.340
Been a long time
since I've been in this old house.

54:44.184 --> 54:48.120
- D'you always live here in Sullivan?
- No, I grew up in the Southwest.

54:48.255 --> 54:50.553
I came up here after the army and...

54:50.690 --> 54:53.022
met Claire and... that was it.

54:54.694 --> 54:57.857
There used to be an old stone fireplace
where this bar is.

54:58.198 --> 55:00.564
- Really? Wish they'd kept that.
- Amazing, huh?

55:00.700 --> 55:02.361
Excuse me.

55:03.370 --> 55:04.359
Hello?

55:05.539 --> 55:07.029
Why haven't you left yet?

55:10.043 --> 55:11.510
Her platelets were that low?

55:12.712 --> 55:14.202
Even after the transfusion?

55:17.550 --> 55:19.041
Yeah, I know, I know. Just...

55:21.220 --> 55:23.883
Okay, just... just get home safe.

55:28.228 --> 55:30.719
It's right
what you and your wife are doin'.

56:02.762 --> 56:05.595
If it were anybody but you, Mr. Sanford,
on my rock...

56:12.772 --> 56:14.603
I didn't know you hung out here.

56:15.275 --> 56:18.073
My son and his friends
used to play hockey here in the winter.

56:20.447 --> 56:22.108
That was his dream...

56:23.116 --> 56:25.107
... playing hockey for the NHL.

56:26.620 --> 56:30.923
All I ever wanted to do
was play baseball when I was his age.

56:36.229 --> 56:37.628
How about you?

56:37.964 --> 56:39.397
You know what you wanna be?

56:39.966 --> 56:41.092
Happy?

56:44.470 --> 56:46.166
Sounds simple enough, doesn't it?

56:50.477 --> 56:52.445
Actually,
what I really wanna be is a writer.

56:52.579 --> 56:54.638
- Really?
- Yeah.

56:55.982 --> 56:57.381
How'd you decide on that?

56:57.984 --> 57:00.214
I've been keeping a journal
since I was nine.

57:00.353 --> 57:03.845
Y'know, my escape from my mom
and what was going on in my house,

57:03.990 --> 57:05.855
but... you probably know all of this.

57:06.493 --> 57:08.154
Wade never said anything to me.

57:09.329 --> 57:12.662
Other than you were his niece
and you were stayin' with him.

57:14.167 --> 57:16.931
My friends and I got picked up
by the police a couple of times.

57:17.070 --> 57:19.436
- Ah.
- I mean, nothing serious, but,

57:19.573 --> 57:24.405
y'know, I had to produce a parent;
otherwise... foster care.

57:26.346 --> 57:27.836
And I couldn't find my mom.

57:28.515 --> 57:29.982
Big surprise, right?

57:32.018 --> 57:35.852
So I called Uncle Wade and...
he came right away and brought me here.

57:37.857 --> 57:38.846
Yeah.

57:42.529 --> 57:44.360
Started writing a children's book.

57:46.032 --> 57:47.226
And I dunno.

57:47.367 --> 57:49.232
Maybe it's stupid.

57:49.369 --> 57:53.362
- What do I know about kids?
- I'll bet you know a lot about kids.

57:53.707 --> 57:56.540
- Yeah? Why?
- Well, you were one once.

57:57.043 --> 57:58.601
And not that long ago.

58:00.680 --> 58:04.514
I don't think anybody really knows if
they're good at anything till they try it.

58:06.886 --> 58:10.219
If your dream is being a writer,
then I say write.

58:13.059 --> 58:15.960
Gotta tell ya,
I came here today hopin' I'd see ya.

58:17.230 --> 58:18.959
I got a favour to ask ya.

58:19.899 --> 58:22.766
Might involve actin' like a kid again.

58:29.576 --> 58:30.975
Okay, Vanessa, turn around.

58:31.110 --> 58:33.739
Wait, let me...
let me get your arm through.

58:34.247 --> 58:35.771
Okay, here we go.

58:35.915 --> 58:38.110
Turn around. Okay.

58:38.250 --> 58:40.116
You look really good.
Do you feel good?

58:40.253 --> 58:41.948
- Yeah.
- You look exactly like a turtle.

58:46.359 --> 58:49.522
C'mon, let's go see who it is.
C'mon.

58:49.663 --> 58:51.096
C'mon, buddy.

58:52.499 --> 58:55.297
- Stop it. Stop it!
- Shhh, they're coming.

58:55.435 --> 58:57.596
Trick or treat!

58:59.105 --> 59:01.198
- I don't have any candy to give.
- Doesn't matter.

59:01.340 --> 59:03.070
We're just here for the party.

59:03.209 --> 59:05.370
Well... well, come on in.

59:07.380 --> 59:09.211
- Happy Halloween! Happy Halloween!
- Hey, Vanessa.

59:11.450 --> 59:12.941
- Hi.
- Hi.

59:20.293 --> 59:21.817
Oh!

59:21.960 --> 59:23.792
- Good job!
- Good job!

59:27.700 --> 59:29.168
Oh!

59:29.302 --> 59:31.327
- I know, it's really cool.
- Yeah!

59:31.470 --> 59:34.269
Do it again!

59:40.413 --> 59:42.313
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

59:43.216 --> 59:45.810
All righty.
Oh, I like that.

59:47.587 --> 59:49.487
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

59:50.156 --> 59:51.384
Thank you.

59:59.199 --> 01:00:02.492
<i>The door to the passageway</i>
was stuck.

01:00:03.336 --> 01:00:08.834
Their only light from their one candle
was flickering and flickering.

01:00:09.676 --> 01:00:11.701
It went out!

01:00:11.845 --> 01:00:17.339
Tiny flashes of light scurried about:
mice or something worse.

01:00:18.184 --> 01:00:20.414
She's coming...

01:00:20.553 --> 01:00:22.817
She's coming.

01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:26.022
The witch is coming.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.627
They tried the door once more
as the cries got louder

01:00:31.765 --> 01:00:34.393
and the witch was coming up closer

01:00:34.534 --> 01:00:38.231
to them and BOOM!

01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:43.197
Okay.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.710
Well?

01:00:58.224 --> 01:00:59.714
Happy Halloween.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.720
Yeah.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.835
- Anybody home?!
- Over here, Tom!

01:01:25.685 --> 01:01:29.051
Sorry it took me a couple of weeks
to get this stuff back to ya.

01:01:29.189 --> 01:01:31.714
That stuff was for the kids.
You didn't have to bring it back.

01:01:31.858 --> 01:01:33.257
Oh, thanks.

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:38.128
- So? How'd the party go?
- Yeah. Great, yeah.

01:01:38.264 --> 01:01:41.290
They, uh... Gordon and Vanessa
really appreciated the kids comin'.

01:01:41.434 --> 01:01:42.901
We... we did, too.

01:01:43.036 --> 01:01:44.469
- Ah, good.
- Yeah.

01:01:44.604 --> 01:01:46.469
Can't have a party without a few kids.

01:01:46.606 --> 01:01:47.766
Right.

01:01:48.708 --> 01:01:50.266
Glad it went good.

01:01:50.944 --> 01:01:52.343
Thank you.

01:01:53.613 --> 01:01:57.014
Hey, uh... you got time,
we can go over to the tree farm

01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:59.311
and put a tag on one for ya.

01:01:59.452 --> 01:02:00.714
I'd love to.

01:02:00.854 --> 01:02:02.412
I, uh...

01:02:02.555 --> 01:02:06.116
- I wanted to make it a family thing.
- Yeah, we can do that, too.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.690
Our schedule's gettin' kinda
hectic again. Uh...

01:02:10.463 --> 01:02:13.591
... how's next week work for ya?
Next week it is.

01:02:35.755 --> 01:02:37.450
"D".

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:39.114
"D".

01:02:49.335 --> 01:02:54.534
"Gracie was hungry. It was
early morning in the public gardens

01:02:54.674 --> 01:02:57.006
"and <i>she</i> was ready for breakfast.

01:02:57.844 --> 01:03:02.042
"Gracie launched herself
into the cool water of the fountain,

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:06.417
"fluffing her feathers
as a spray sprinkled all around her.

01:03:06.553 --> 01:03:10.785
"The gates of the public garden
would soon be unlocked

01:03:10.924 --> 01:03:14.382
"and Mr. Black Suit
usually arrived shortly after.

01:03:14.527 --> 01:03:17.557
"He would sit on the park bench
to drink his coffee,

01:03:17.697 --> 01:03:20.564
"and he always shared
his breakfast with her.

01:03:21.534 --> 01:03:25.435
"Muffins, thought Gracie, as
Mr. Black Suit appeared around the bend.

01:03:25.572 --> 01:03:29.405
"That looks like a muffin bag.
Oh, yummy!"

01:03:34.547 --> 01:03:37.812
I, uh, wanna take you up on your offer
to help with the reading series,

01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:39.942
if it's not too late?
It's never too late.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.688
- What days are you free?
- Uh, since school started,

01:03:42.822 --> 01:03:45.620
I'm free Saturdays
and Thursday afternoons.

01:03:45.758 --> 01:03:48.249
- Saturdays work.
- Ah, great.

01:03:48.394 --> 01:03:51.557
This is the reading list
and the dates.

01:03:52.966 --> 01:03:54.957
"The Five Chinese Brothers."
Great book.

01:03:55.902 --> 01:03:57.460
"Harold and the Purple Crayon."

01:03:58.404 --> 01:04:00.929
My mom used to read it to me
when I was little.

01:04:01.074 --> 01:04:02.507
The good early years.

01:04:04.077 --> 01:04:05.772
My son loved that book.

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.873
I'm glad you're here.

01:04:10.416 --> 01:04:11.747
Me, too.

01:04:15.388 --> 01:04:17.913
"... gardens through the swinging gate,
crossed the road..."

01:04:18.758 --> 01:04:20.419
Is this boring for you?

01:04:21.094 --> 01:04:24.621
- The best part of this book is the pictures.
- You're right.

01:04:25.264 --> 01:04:27.357
It's a cool hat.
You wear hats a lot?

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.331
It's because I don't have any hair.

01:04:30.603 --> 01:04:32.935
My best friend likes to shave her head.

01:04:34.273 --> 01:04:36.798
So I started writing
that story we talked about.

01:04:36.943 --> 01:04:39.969
- The possum one?
- Yeah, only now it's a rooster.

01:04:40.113 --> 01:04:41.307
That's better.

01:04:41.447 --> 01:04:43.244
I'm calling it "My Secret Pal."

01:04:43.383 --> 01:04:46.045
I drew a rooster, we have it
on the wall.

01:04:46.185 --> 01:04:48.710
- Could I see it sometime?
- Come to our house.

01:04:48.855 --> 01:04:50.789
Okay, sounds great.

01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:54.157
Maybe you can help with the story.
Do drawings for it,

01:04:54.293 --> 01:04:55.851
if you want to.
Okay.

01:04:55.995 --> 01:04:58.259
Okay.

01:05:05.972 --> 01:05:08.668
<i>¶ Ever see the wild goose</i>

01:05:08.808 --> 01:05:11.038
<i>¶ Sailing on the ocean</i>

01:05:11.177 --> 01:05:13.270

<i>¶ When they get the notion</i>

01:06:46.906 --> 01:06:48.897
- This one!
- This one, yeah!

01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:53.173
Guys, that one's a little tall.

01:06:53.312 --> 01:06:56.076
- This is definitely the one.
- What do you think, can we have it?

01:06:56.415 --> 01:06:59.475
<i>¶ I said how are you</i>

01:06:59.619 --> 01:07:01.587

01:08:52.365 --> 01:08:53.854
This was so great.

01:08:54.533 --> 01:08:56.194
And that pie!

01:08:57.904 --> 01:08:59.029
Thanks.

01:09:00.206 --> 01:09:03.368
It's one of Jess's favourites.
I can see why.

01:09:05.044 --> 01:09:06.738
So how did you two meet?

01:09:08.714 --> 01:09:10.045
Oh...

01:09:11.216 --> 01:09:12.912
Once upon a time in the '60s.

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:17.951
Jess had come up here for a concert
at a nearby farm

01:09:18.090 --> 01:09:20.718
and I was one of the locals
working the show.

01:09:23.562 --> 01:09:27.560
I saw him standing and waiting
at the first aid tent.

01:09:27.899 --> 01:09:30.390
He had this terrible cut on his foot.

01:09:32.069 --> 01:09:33.629
Oh, he was... so handsome.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.970
And my uncle was the town doctor,

01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:40.408
so I offered him
a ride into town and...

01:09:41.747 --> 01:09:44.078
... he said yes and he never left.

01:09:48.453 --> 01:09:50.081
What about you two?

01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:54.252
Uh, we met at our first job
right out of college.

01:09:55.928 --> 01:09:58.089
Oh, could he make me laugh.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.261
I miss those days.

01:10:10.776 --> 01:10:11.868
Beth...

01:10:13.779 --> 01:10:17.449
... you know we're just right down
the road...

01:10:19.452 --> 01:10:21.283
... if you need anything.

01:10:25.124 --> 01:10:26.284
Thank you.

01:10:33.299 --> 01:10:34.789
Those your old toys?

01:10:36.635 --> 01:10:38.796
Those belonged to our son, Steven.

01:10:41.307 --> 01:10:43.298
He died when he was 13.

01:10:49.982 --> 01:10:51.313
What happened?

01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:54.482
Comin' home from a hockey game...

01:10:57.990 --> 01:11:00.959
... minivan hit a patch of ice
on the highway.

01:11:02.328 --> 01:11:03.659
Lost control.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.992
Stevie and the driver died on the spot.

01:11:19.178 --> 01:11:22.506
Someone tried to comfort me
with the notion that...

01:11:24.683 --> 01:11:27.000
... when a child is taken...

01:11:30.523 --> 01:11:35.255
... their soul only had
a tiny mission to accomplish here.

01:11:39.698 --> 01:11:43.200
That's why they were blessed
to depart.

01:11:47.706 --> 01:11:51.369
Needless to say, God and I
haven't seen eye to eye since.

01:12:06.559 --> 01:12:08.720
I'm scared outta my mind, Jess.

01:12:12.998 --> 01:12:14.556
Vanessa's so strong...

01:12:15.568 --> 01:12:18.401
... I just can't shake the feeling
that we're gonna lose her.

01:12:23.075 --> 01:12:25.066
You've been dealt a bad hand, Tom.

01:12:29.415 --> 01:12:30.905
I wish I could change it.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.840
What'd he do?

01:12:56.976 --> 01:12:59.604
He threw a ball through
the chapel window.

01:13:00.446 --> 01:13:03.108
- Fella's got a good arm.
- Sure does.

01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:07.646
I need to ask you a favour, Bob.

01:13:08.287 --> 01:13:09.777
In your daily prayers...

01:13:10.456 --> 01:13:13.687
... would you mind puttin' one in
for my neighbours?

01:13:13.826 --> 01:13:15.657
Tom Marks and his family.

01:13:15.794 --> 01:13:17.523
His little girl, Vanessa.

01:13:19.798 --> 01:13:21.265
Yeah, will do.

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:25.532
- Thanks.
- But, you know, your prayers

01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:28.162
have just as much weight as mine.

01:13:29.642 --> 01:13:30.631
Yeah.

01:13:31.644 --> 01:13:34.374
Been a long time
since I was one of his regulars.

01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:36.470
God knows you, Jess.

01:13:37.316 --> 01:13:39.113
And he never stopped listening.

01:13:44.657 --> 01:13:45.646
Thanks.

01:13:52.398 --> 01:13:55.333
The dishes are in the rinse cycle,
I placed the order for tomorrow's pastries,

01:13:55.467 --> 01:13:57.401
and I will be back before my shift starts.

01:13:57.536 --> 01:13:58.867
Wait up, Tammy.

01:13:59.505 --> 01:14:02.338
- What'd I forget?
- I don't want you ridin' your bike

01:14:02.474 --> 01:14:04.203
in the dark.
It'll still be light.

01:14:04.343 --> 01:14:08.612
No bike. Eyes on the road
the whole time, no speeding,

01:14:08.747 --> 01:14:10.738
no radio. Hmm?

01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:14.182
Thank you.

01:14:19.124 --> 01:14:20.421
<i>This is supposed to be a cloud.</i>

01:14:22.528 --> 01:14:25.554
- Is that your doctor?
- Uh-huh. It's Dr. Patel.

01:14:25.698 --> 01:14:27.029
She's really nice.

01:14:30.536 --> 01:14:33.266
- Is that you?
- Mm-hmm. It's me with hair.

01:14:36.375 --> 01:14:38.741
This one is a watercolour.

01:14:38.877 --> 01:14:40.367
So is this.

01:14:40.512 --> 01:14:43.944
And here,
is my second pair of drawings.

01:14:44.083 --> 01:14:46.381
It's pastels.
You're really, really good.

01:14:46.518 --> 01:14:48.418
- Hmm.
- Can I see more?

01:14:48.554 --> 01:14:49.816
Sure.

01:14:52.890 --> 01:14:54.916
This is like on the farm.

01:14:57.162 --> 01:14:58.925
And this is supposed to be Stanley.

01:15:00.399 --> 01:15:06.301
And... this,
is at the bottom of the sea, I think.

01:15:07.906 --> 01:15:10.500
And this is a princess on a unicorn,

01:15:10.643 --> 01:15:13.908
and she's gonna go
all the way up the mountains

01:15:14.046 --> 01:15:17.413
and she's gonna find her
true love up there.

01:15:26.925 --> 01:15:29.291
Hey... here's my helper.

01:15:29.428 --> 01:15:32.261
- Thanks a lot.
- Thank <i>you.</i>

01:15:32.398 --> 01:15:34.195
I wanted some company today.
Buddy,

01:15:34.333 --> 01:15:37.825
I'm gonna be back right after dinner.
How long is that?

01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:40.063
- Not long.
- We're gonna be so busy,

01:15:40.205 --> 01:15:44.505
you won't know where the time went.
Let's go sneak up on Mr. Sanford

01:15:44.643 --> 01:15:46.440
and Stanley, okay?

01:15:51.684 --> 01:15:55.120
Okay, so I'm gonna show you something,
Gordon, okay?

01:15:55.254 --> 01:15:57.279
This is where it's...

01:16:05.297 --> 01:16:07.197
Vanessa's counts are down.

01:16:07.333 --> 01:16:09.528
- Well, they've been down before.
- Yes.

01:16:09.668 --> 01:16:12.637
However, this time, lymphoblasts
appeared on her blood smear.

01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:16.202
We have to admit her now
and start a new round of chemo.

01:16:16.342 --> 01:16:18.367
- What... what does that mean?
- We begin again

01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:21.673
with a new drug.
One day at a time.

01:16:31.824 --> 01:16:33.314
Here you go, buddy.

01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:39.798
When's my daddy gonna be here?

01:16:39.932 --> 01:16:42.992
As soon as you get up from your nap.

01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:46.502
- Are you gonna stay with me?
- I am.

01:16:47.339 --> 01:16:48.670
And Stanley?

01:16:50.008 --> 01:16:51.498
He's already here.

01:17:07.192 --> 01:17:11.288
Hey, Jess. I heard you've had yourself
a young boarder these past few weeks.

01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:14.922
Only during the day.
His dad picks him up again at night.

01:17:15.067 --> 01:17:17.627
- Things workin' out okay?
- It's workin' out fine.

01:17:17.770 --> 01:17:20.034
Claire has really taken
to little Gordon.

01:17:20.873 --> 01:17:22.704
It's been nice for all of us.

01:17:24.042 --> 01:17:27.068
We like havin' little feet
under us again.

01:17:27.212 --> 01:17:29.942
I'm sorry it's not
under different circumstances.

01:17:30.082 --> 01:17:32.710
- How's the little girl doin'?
- She's fightin' the fight.

01:17:33.886 --> 01:17:36.411
I'm headin' over there now.
Tell her hi for me?

01:17:37.723 --> 01:17:40.722
- I will.
- It's wonderful, what you're doing, Jess.

01:17:41.393 --> 01:17:42.724
Thank you, Bob.

01:17:43.228 --> 01:17:47.758
Listen... if they need any...
takeout meals or... anything,

01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:49.925
let me know.

01:17:50.736 --> 01:17:51.794
Same here.

01:17:53.405 --> 01:17:57.000
Well, that's what it's all about, huh?
People reachin' out.

01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:58.899
Yeah.

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:02.738
See ya.

01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:12.921
<i>She's really weak.</i>

01:18:13.592 --> 01:18:16.083
They're talkin' about sendin' us
home soon.

01:18:17.262 --> 01:18:20.095
They have to stop the treatments
till she gets stronger.

01:18:20.599 --> 01:18:22.123
Did they give you any idea?

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.762
All her counts have to go up.

01:18:27.272 --> 01:18:29.137
These drugs really beat her up.

01:18:30.943 --> 01:18:33.571
So in a month... six weeks,

01:18:33.712 --> 01:18:36.442
we'll see if she needs to come back
for more treatments.

01:18:39.284 --> 01:18:42.776
Gordon can stay with us
for as long as you need to be here.

01:18:45.457 --> 01:18:47.789
You guys oughta get outta here
for a while.

01:18:48.627 --> 01:18:50.026
Take a walk.

01:18:50.162 --> 01:18:52.096
Breathe some real air.

01:18:58.537 --> 01:19:01.131
Let me go and sit with her for a while.

01:19:03.275 --> 01:19:04.799
It'll be all right.

01:19:06.645 --> 01:19:08.010
Go on.

01:19:09.982 --> 01:19:12.610
<i>Dr. Gregory, please report...</i>

01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:16.050
<i>Dr. Gregory, please report</i>
<i>to Physical Therapy.</i>

01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:27.821
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:29.835 --> 01:19:31.996
Okay if I sit with you
for a little bit?

01:19:33.005 --> 01:19:34.029
Sure.

01:19:40.178 --> 01:19:42.339
- How you doin'?
- I'm okay.

01:19:44.016 --> 01:19:46.683
- How's Stanley?
- He's good.

01:19:48.353 --> 01:19:49.877
I know he'd like to see ya.

01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:54.022
My dad says we're going home soon.

01:19:54.693 --> 01:19:57.184
But I might have to come back
at Christmas.

01:19:58.363 --> 01:19:59.887
I don't like it here.

01:20:01.033 --> 01:20:02.933
I don't wanna be here for Christmas.

01:20:03.068 --> 01:20:04.535
That's why I'm here.

01:20:06.538 --> 01:20:09.871
I have it on good authority
that you will be home for Christmas.

01:20:14.046 --> 01:20:15.536
I want you to rest up.

01:20:18.050 --> 01:20:19.881
Be ready to celebrate.

01:20:21.386 --> 01:20:23.547
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:20:39.438 --> 01:20:44.075
He was under the Christmas tree
and my son Stevie was about two.

01:20:45.410 --> 01:20:47.105
What, you like it?

01:20:47.245 --> 01:20:48.735
Wow.

01:20:49.414 --> 01:20:51.245
And then, look at this.

01:20:51.917 --> 01:20:53.976
This big guy...

01:20:54.119 --> 01:20:56.280
is Mr. Billingsly.

01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:58.286
- Wow.
- And he...

01:20:58.423 --> 01:21:01.950
has to know everything
that's going on around the house.

01:21:02.094 --> 01:21:06.889
And he asks lots and lots
of questions, just like you-know-who.

01:21:07.032 --> 01:21:09.262
- Me.
- You, yeah.

01:21:11.603 --> 01:21:12.968
Wow.

01:21:13.105 --> 01:21:15.096
And then, there's this.

01:21:17.109 --> 01:21:18.804
Whoa. Can we play with him?

01:21:18.944 --> 01:21:21.811
Well, when it stops raining,
I'm gonna take you outside

01:21:21.947 --> 01:21:25.474
and I am gonna see
how fast you can make him run.

01:21:25.617 --> 01:21:26.982
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:21:27.119 --> 01:21:28.643
- Okay.
- Wow...

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.611
- Wanna hold him?
- Uh-huh.

01:21:31.857 --> 01:21:33.085
Wow...!

01:21:47.305 --> 01:21:49.637
It's... so much better than I expected.

01:21:50.475 --> 01:21:52.602
It's simple and... and great.

01:21:54.646 --> 01:21:56.511
Mr. Tim should wear glasses.

01:22:01.653 --> 01:22:02.984
I have to go.

01:22:03.655 --> 01:22:05.987
I have my uncle's car
and I can't be late.

01:22:07.826 --> 01:22:11.318
But, hey, next time we get together
is at my house, okay?

01:22:12.998 --> 01:22:16.862
Come on, Vanessa,
you got a book to work on.

01:22:17.002 --> 01:22:18.731
I mean, you've seen how I draw.

01:22:54.306 --> 01:22:55.933
I proposed to Susie today.

01:22:59.210 --> 01:23:00.803
She accepted.

01:23:00.946 --> 01:23:02.072
She did?

01:23:03.715 --> 01:23:05.546
I want you to be my best man.

01:23:08.887 --> 01:23:11.082
Are you sure she said yes?

01:23:11.223 --> 01:23:13.623
Shhh... Come on.

01:23:23.268 --> 01:23:24.599
Let's go!

01:23:24.736 --> 01:23:27.068
- Bye.
- Thank you both so much.

01:23:27.739 --> 01:23:28.728
Thanks.

01:24:59.830 --> 01:25:01.162
It's beautiful.

01:25:41.539 --> 01:25:43.769
- Come on, honey.
- Come on, sweetie.

01:25:52.217 --> 01:25:53.548
Come here, sweetheart.

01:25:56.554 --> 01:25:58.215
Welcome home, Vanessa.

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.887
Good to see you back.

01:26:04.729 --> 01:26:06.060
Thank you.

01:26:06.730 --> 01:26:08.062
Do you see?

01:26:11.102 --> 01:26:14.071
Mr. Sanford, you were right.

01:26:15.907 --> 01:26:17.272
It's Christmas.

01:26:19.244 --> 01:26:21.235
Merry Christmas, Vanessa.

01:26:26.418 --> 01:26:27.646
Merry Christmas.

01:26:30.488 --> 01:26:32.581
Merry Christmas, Vanessa.

01:26:33.758 --> 01:26:35.248
Merry Christmas.

01:26:47.172 --> 01:26:49.606
Come on, sweetie, let's go inside.

01:26:50.308 --> 01:26:51.969
Come on, Gordon.

01:26:54.946 --> 01:26:56.811
I don't know how to thank you.

01:26:56.948 --> 01:26:58.609
You don't have to thank me.

01:26:59.950 --> 01:27:02.112
Just go inside
and be with your family.

01:28:16.194 --> 01:28:18.628
<i>"Just as my mother had promised,</i>

01:28:18.763 --> 01:28:21.891
<i>"by the first snowfall,</i>
<i>I did begin to get better.</i>

01:28:22.033 --> 01:28:26.732
<i>"And just as I believed the girls</i>
<i>in my snow globe went on and on,</i>

01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:30.705
<i>"I saw and began to believe</i>

01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:33.677
"The real medicine for my recovery

01:28:33.812 --> 01:28:37.213
"was the boundless goodness
shown to me and my family.

01:28:37.882 --> 01:28:40.874
"And just as we became
part of our little town,

01:28:41.019 --> 01:28:45.581
"I became part of something nobody

01:28:45.723 --> 01:28:48.055
this wonderful world."

01:28:51.729 --> 01:28:54.129
Thank you.

01:28:54.265 --> 01:28:55.892
Thank you.

01:28:58.403 --> 01:28:59.893
That was really good.

01:29:00.572 --> 01:29:02.039
It was really a good story.

01:29:02.173 --> 01:29:03.470
I love your writing.

01:29:03.608 --> 01:29:05.075
Oh, bye.

01:29:05.743 --> 01:29:06.937
Bye, sweetie.

01:29:07.078 --> 01:29:08.409
- Bye.
- Bye!

01:29:08.546 --> 01:29:10.605
- Bye-Bye.
- Bye.

01:29:10.748 --> 01:29:12.579
- See you soon!
- Merry Christmas.

01:29:13.918 --> 01:29:15.317
Bye.

01:29:15.453 --> 01:29:17.785
Don't forget your backpack.
Come on, guys.

01:29:17.922 --> 01:29:20.618
You liked that, didn't you, buddy?

01:29:20.758 --> 01:29:23.352
Was that story really about you?

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:26.924
- Yeah, it was.
- Did you have to go back to the hospital?

01:29:27.065 --> 01:29:28.965
All right, let's go.

01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:30.829
Between you and me, I did.

01:29:30.969 --> 01:29:33.961
But pretty soon after that,
I really did get better.

01:29:34.105 --> 01:29:35.766
- That's good.
- Yeah, it is.

01:29:36.608 --> 01:29:38.098
- Have a great Christmas.
- Thank you.

01:29:38.243 --> 01:29:39.141
Bye.

01:29:41.813 --> 01:29:43.713
Okay. Yeah. Get the car.

01:30:49.547 --> 01:30:52.175
I didn't think you could top last year.

01:30:52.317 --> 01:30:54.979
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Unbelievable.

01:30:55.787 --> 01:30:57.311
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey.

01:31:00.525 --> 01:31:01.651
Hi.

01:31:04.095 --> 01:31:06.723
Hey, Gordon.
It's good to see you.

01:31:06.864 --> 01:31:08.195
You, too.

01:31:09.867 --> 01:31:11.391
Hi.
Welcome home.

01:31:11.536 --> 01:31:12.662
Thank you.

01:31:18.409 --> 01:31:20.707
Well... I'm here to take my tree.

01:31:20.845 --> 01:31:24.747
You're late. Christmas comes
in November around here.

01:31:28.386 --> 01:31:29.512
Mm.

01:31:31.923 --> 01:31:33.891
Merry Christmas, Vanessa.

01:31:34.392 --> 01:31:36.882
- Thank you.
- C'mon...

01:31:38.062 --> 01:31:40.030
Let's go find ya the perfect tree.
