00:01.366 --> 00:03.101
Previously on Pretty Little Liars.

00:03.102 --> 00:04.502
Welcome to the Lost Woods resort.

00:04.503 --> 00:06.704
Maybe you remember our
friend, Vivian Darkbloom.

00:06.705 --> 00:09.474
You check in at the Lost Woods
because you don't want to be found.

00:09.475 --> 00:11.142
- What are you doing here?
- I was curious.

00:11.143 --> 00:13.980
- He's the father of my son.
- Yeah, he deserves to know that.

00:13.981 --> 00:17.314
I didn't kill Alison,
but Jenna thinks I did.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.584
- That's it?
- I went back.

00:19.585 --> 00:21.654
- You're lying.
- She was alive when I left.

00:27.627 --> 00:29.694
Meredith got the job. -
The job at Rosewood High.

00:29.695 --> 00:32.499
Well, Aria, I forgot you're
still a student here.

00:36.469 --> 00:39.802
Change of plan. I'll see you soon.

01:18.678 --> 01:21.479
- Is it a bad time?
- What are you doing here?

01:21.480 --> 01:23.516
My doctors released me. -
In the middle of the night?

01:23.517 --> 01:25.584
Hanna, I need your help.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.720
My parents are forcing
me to go back to school,

01:27.721 --> 01:30.756
- and I'm so scared.
- Mona...

01:30.757 --> 01:33.925
Everyone knows what I've done,
and I have no one in my corner.

01:33.926 --> 01:36.729
If you're expecting me and
my friends to forgive you...

01:36.730 --> 01:40.063
I don't expect them to, but,
Hanna, you're different.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.603
Wren said you were my guardian angel.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.004
He said that you stood up for me.

01:46.005 --> 01:48.107
You are not defenseless, Mona.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.441
You spent the last two
years majoring in torture.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.247
You don't believe that a
person can get better?

01:54.248 --> 01:57.182
Hanna, I had a breakdown,

01:57.183 --> 01:59.218
but I've turned a corner.

01:59.219 --> 02:01.252
I'm on new meds, everything's changed.

02:01.253 --> 02:03.056
I'm not proud of who I was.

02:03.057 --> 02:06.024
Just try to see me for who I am. Now.

02:06.025 --> 02:08.059
I do see you, Mona.
You're freaking me out.

02:08.060 --> 02:09.895
( Knocking on door ) - Hanna!

02:09.896 --> 02:12.064
Who's that?

02:12.065 --> 02:15.398
- Yeah, grandma?
- Are you alone in there? I heard voices.

02:15.502 --> 02:17.870
Uh, no, no. It's just me.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.973
I'm... reading out loud. Go back to sleep.

02:22.475 --> 02:23.943
( Quietly ) Thank you.

03:41.154 --> 03:44.487
He's here to install the new alarm.
Sorry, babe.

03:44.958 --> 03:47.024
I didn't think they'd
get to the second floor

03:47.025 --> 03:48.726
until after you left for school.

03:48.727 --> 03:50.995
You're putting an alarm on my window?

03:50.996 --> 03:54.167
On every window. Your mom
wants the best system around.

03:54.168 --> 03:57.501
There's an app where I can turn
it on remote from my phone.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.503
So how will I know when it's on?

03:59.504 --> 04:02.139
Well, considering what's
been happening in this town

04:02.140 --> 04:04.210
for the past two years, think 24/7.

04:04.211 --> 04:06.178
Did you eat?

04:06.179 --> 04:09.047
Yeah, I'll grab something.

04:09.048 --> 04:10.682
Hilary Reynolds called.

04:10.683 --> 04:13.186
She's so angry, she can barely speak.

04:13.187 --> 04:17.036
Wait, Garrett's mother? What did she want?

04:19.091 --> 04:20.593
She wants her son back.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.227
But she can't have that.

04:22.228 --> 04:24.495
So she's going after the Rosewood police.

04:24.496 --> 04:26.897
I told her I would be there tomorrow
night at the community meeting.

04:26.898 --> 04:29.000
- Why would you go to that?
- Why wouldn't I?

04:29.001 --> 04:31.035
She's right. They let an
innocent man out of jail,

04:31.036 --> 04:33.039
and provided no protection for him.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.794
I don't think of the word
"innocent" when I think of Garrett.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.976
Evidently, you're not alone.

04:38.977 --> 04:40.978
Looks like somebody else
thought it was their right

04:40.979 --> 04:42.680
to take justice into their own hands.

04:42.681 --> 04:44.982
Dad, Alison's murder
has never been solved.

04:44.983 --> 04:47.020
You still think Garrett did it?

04:47.021 --> 04:49.121
Do you?

04:49.122 --> 04:51.188
I'm gonna be late. Are
my sneakers downstairs?

04:51.189 --> 04:53.491
I'm not so sure you'll go on that run.

04:53.492 --> 04:55.192
Your mom and I just aren't comfortable

04:55.193 --> 04:56.663
with you being out after dark.

04:56.664 --> 04:59.831
- Dad, I raised $274 in pledges.
- I know.

04:59.832 --> 05:02.200
You're welcome to have Paige over,

05:02.201 --> 05:04.169
but you are not going out.

05:07.573 --> 05:09.206
Aria: So this is the new world order?

05:09.207 --> 05:12.143
We're gonna have to face off
with Mona in school every day?

05:12.144 --> 05:14.679
She told Hanna that she's better now.
Better at what?

05:14.680 --> 05:17.081
I'll tell you what. She sneaks
in my house past midnight,

05:17.082 --> 05:19.050
I'm sleeping with a
crowbar under my pillow.

05:19.051 --> 05:21.254
The only question is, do we ignore her?

05:21.255 --> 05:22.921
Here's a hint. Yes.

05:22.922 --> 05:26.255
Mona had serious insight
into what happened to Maya.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.794
What if she could tell us
why Garrett was killed?

05:29.795 --> 05:32.997
So now you think Mona's the
keeper of more secrets?

05:32.998 --> 05:34.200
She certainly knows all of ours.

05:34.201 --> 05:37.534
What if she has some kind of
connection to the N.A.T. club?

05:37.537 --> 05:40.540
Spencer, that club ended while
she was still loser Mona.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.641
Pre-lasik and metal mouth.

05:42.642 --> 05:44.975
If those pervs didn't even
wanna peep in her window,

05:44.976 --> 05:46.713
why would they wanna hang out with her?

05:46.714 --> 05:49.214
Maybe she was peeping at them.

05:49.215 --> 05:52.149
Look, two members of the N.A.T.
club are dead.

05:52.150 --> 05:54.819
Okay, maybe the person who
killed Ali is still freaked out

05:54.820 --> 05:56.989
that there's a tape floating
around somewhere out there.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.157
Did you...

05:59.158 --> 06:01.727
Did you ever ask your dad?

06:01.728 --> 06:04.162
Ask him what?

06:04.163 --> 06:06.164
About what Garrett said.

06:06.165 --> 06:08.532
You know, about him meeting
up with Ali that night.

06:08.533 --> 06:11.102
My dad and I are finally getting along.

06:11.103 --> 06:13.771
I'm not gonna slap him with some
whacked-out story garret made up

06:13.772 --> 06:15.740
so he could clear his own name.

06:15.741 --> 06:17.575
I hear you, but... - but what?

06:17.576 --> 06:19.076
Spence, Garrett lied about a lot.

06:19.077 --> 06:21.681
Why are we suddenly gonna
believe anything he ever said?

06:26.853 --> 06:28.687
What's that?

06:28.688 --> 06:31.524
Someone baked you some muffins
and left 'em at the door.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.725
Hm. Who's "M"?

06:35.228 --> 06:38.196
- Mona.
- Mona?

06:38.197 --> 06:40.132
You don't have to eat these.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.167
I've got huevos rancheros,

06:42.168 --> 06:45.103
pork sausage, and hash browns.

06:45.104 --> 06:46.973
- Please stop.
- Are you sick?

06:46.974 --> 06:47.973
I could be.

06:47.974 --> 06:51.307
Is this Mona the same Mona...

06:51.477 --> 06:54.810
Yeah. She wants a fresh start.

06:55.014 --> 06:56.549
Are you ready to give it to her?

06:56.550 --> 06:59.050
It's complicated, grandma.

06:59.051 --> 07:00.685
I hear you, honey.

07:00.686 --> 07:02.721
When cousin Heshy came back,

07:02.722 --> 07:04.891
no one wanted to touch him
with a ten-foot pole.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.958
Who's cousin Heshy?

07:06.959 --> 07:08.660
Alberta's youngest.

07:08.661 --> 07:10.729
He was always a little off,

07:10.730 --> 07:12.932
but in high school, he jumped the tracks.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.699
What'd he do?

07:14.700 --> 07:17.703
One morning at breakfast,
he served his mom and dad

07:17.704 --> 07:20.972
two bowls of rusty nails

07:20.973 --> 07:21.974
with milk poured over 'em.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.876
And when they refused to eat,

07:24.877 --> 07:27.145
he snatched up a fistful,

07:27.146 --> 07:30.048
and just squeezed until blood came out.

07:30.049 --> 07:33.382
I'm sorry. How are we
related to this person?

07:33.653 --> 07:35.153
Oh, no, my point is,

07:35.154 --> 07:37.924
they sent him away for about four months.

07:37.925 --> 07:40.091
He's been fine ever since.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.198
So you really think people can change?

07:45.199 --> 07:46.865
Heshy did.

07:46.866 --> 07:50.199
I mean, the thing is, what's done is done.

07:50.536 --> 07:53.604
- And when the rink gets icy...
- Yeah, I'm exhausted.

07:53.605 --> 07:55.873
I can't deal. I'm taking a sick day.

07:55.874 --> 07:56.909
Hanna, you go to school.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.211
Maybe you need to let this girl

07:59.212 --> 08:01.247
have a chance to win you back.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.181
You know,

08:03.182 --> 08:06.151
if I were her, I'd fight to the death

08:06.152 --> 08:09.054
to have you as my friend.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.597
I'm basically under house arrest.

08:19.598 --> 08:22.533
My mom's now using my dad to
squeeze information outta me

08:22.534 --> 08:23.968
about Halloween, the lighthouse.

08:23.969 --> 08:26.003
- What have you told him?
- Nothing.

08:26.004 --> 08:28.608
If he knew half the crap we'd been
through, he'd ship me off to Guam.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.642
Hey.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.576
Thought you were playing Mona's bodyguard.

08:32.577 --> 08:34.078
Okay, I said I'd be around for her.

08:34.078 --> 08:36.883
I'm thinking maybe we all
should be her friend.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.618
I mean, if Mona knows why Garrett died,

08:39.619 --> 08:41.687
right after he told that
story about Aria's dad...

08:41.688 --> 08:43.087
stop.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.022
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

08:45.023 --> 08:47.525
- We're not gonna talk about that.
- No, go ahead.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.727
Talk about it. Just do
it when I'm not here.

08:49.728 --> 08:50.861
Aria - what's next?

08:50.862 --> 08:52.530
Are we all gonna start wondering

08:52.531 --> 08:53.598
if my dad was on the
Halloween train, too?

08:53.599 --> 08:54.665
What?

08:54.666 --> 08:57.034
You actually believe that
my own dad would drug me,

08:57.035 --> 08:58.671
and then lock me in a box.

09:13.753 --> 09:15.520
Hello, Aria.

09:15.521 --> 09:17.123
Girl: What are you doing here?

09:17.124 --> 09:19.724
Boy: Yeah, you shouldn't be here.

09:26.599 --> 09:29.568
Welcome to Mona 2.0.

09:34.006 --> 09:37.207
- Aria, I'm sorry. I wasn't trying...
- Don't worry about it.

09:37.208 --> 09:39.779
- None of really believe your dad...
- I know.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.047
I overreacted.

09:42.048 --> 09:44.616
The thing is, Garrett did say it,

09:44.617 --> 09:46.250
and it's really freakin' hard

09:46.251 --> 09:48.588
when you can't look at your
boyfriend, and now your own dad,

09:48.589 --> 09:50.755
- without...
- Without what?

09:50.756 --> 09:52.490
Wait, what's with ezra?

09:52.491 --> 09:55.824
- I still haven't told him about...
- His son.

09:55.828 --> 09:59.161
Yeah. I plan on telling him
every time we're together,

09:59.832 --> 10:01.933
but I just bail.

10:04.870 --> 10:05.871
Where's Mrs. Grizzuti?

10:05.872 --> 10:08.239
Uh, I'm guessing she had her baby.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.507
And now Meredith's her replacement?

10:10.508 --> 10:12.211
Please stick a fork in my neck.

10:12.212 --> 10:15.213
( Bell rings )

10:19.251 --> 10:21.819
The check and balance
system was established

10:21.820 --> 10:24.156
so that no branch could
wield absolute power

10:24.157 --> 10:25.924
over another branch.

10:25.925 --> 10:28.960
Why do we think this was so important

10:28.961 --> 10:30.929
to our founding fathers?

10:30.930 --> 10:32.931
Aria.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.699
What?

10:34.700 --> 10:38.033
Look, guys, I don't know what Mrs.
Grazzuti's take was,

10:38.504 --> 10:41.837
but while I'm here, no phones in class.

10:41.874 --> 10:43.743
I wasn't... I wasn't on my phone.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.910
Yeah, you were.

10:45.911 --> 10:48.847
Tell you what. Give it to me.

10:52.051 --> 10:54.153
This way, you won't even be tempted.

10:56.789 --> 10:59.258
It was important to our founding fathers

10:59.259 --> 11:02.592
because they wanted to be sure
that no one had absolute power.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.663
( Bell rings )

11:06.632 --> 11:08.566
Aria.

11:08.567 --> 11:10.770
Can you stay for a few minutes, please?

11:17.243 --> 11:19.478
I guess since you travel in a pack,

11:19.479 --> 11:21.046
you can all stay.

11:21.047 --> 11:23.716
Just so we don't get
off on the wrong foot,

11:23.717 --> 11:25.717
let's be clear.

11:25.718 --> 11:27.819
I have a job to do,

11:27.820 --> 11:31.153
and if you ladies want to graduate,

11:31.157 --> 11:33.925
so do you.

11:33.926 --> 11:35.225
Look, I saw what you were texting.

11:35.226 --> 11:36.762
You're in this class to discuss

11:36.763 --> 11:39.898
American history, not mine. Got it?

11:41.667 --> 11:43.835
Yeah.

11:43.836 --> 11:47.169
Thank you. Have a nice day.

11:53.512 --> 11:56.581
Mona, wait. Mona, I couldn't leave Aria.

11:56.582 --> 11:59.885
No, that's okay. I get it. It
must be really tough for her.

12:04.123 --> 12:07.158
Mona, what is it? Is that a brain?

12:07.159 --> 12:08.493
Close your door.

12:08.494 --> 12:11.096
Close your locker.

12:11.097 --> 12:13.532
Come on, let's get out of here.
What are you doing?

13:11.757 --> 13:15.090
Lucas, what did she say to you?
Who did that?

13:27.006 --> 13:28.940
So wait, wait.

13:28.941 --> 13:30.841
Someone stole that from the bio lab?

13:30.842 --> 13:32.810
They have cow brains up there?

13:32.811 --> 13:34.978
- I didn't even think...
- That's because you got excused

13:34.979 --> 13:36.847
from dissection based
on vegetarian grounds.

13:36.848 --> 13:39.183
Guys, people are gonna think
that we put that in her locker.

13:39.184 --> 13:41.018
It wasn't vegetarian, it was humanitarian.

13:41.019 --> 13:42.986
- Are you still hating on me?
- Possibly.

13:42.987 --> 13:45.689
Guys, pay attention. People
are gonna think that was us.

13:45.690 --> 13:48.792
How? When? We were all being
held hostage by Meredith.

13:48.793 --> 13:51.096
It wasn't in her locker
before first period.

13:51.097 --> 13:54.430
So now we're depending on Meredith
to be our alibi? See you in jail.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.203
I gotta say, Mona's a
lot stronger than me.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.004
I would've lost it.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.774
- I feel sorry for her.
- Yeah, me, too.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.543
Okay, are we done feeling sorry?

14:05.544 --> 14:07.913
Because she's done a
lot worse to us, guys.

14:07.914 --> 14:09.714
A lot.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.751
Hi.

14:14.954 --> 14:16.721
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:21.026 --> 14:24.359
Mona, you don't think we had
anything to do with that, do you?

14:25.664 --> 14:28.997
Of course not. Why would you
dump on me after I helped you?

14:30.803 --> 14:32.170
Helped me?

14:32.171 --> 14:35.474
Figure out who the creep was
that killed your girlfriend.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.179
But I know that there's
still bad blood between us,

14:40.180 --> 14:43.513
and I know that I have to earn your trust,

14:43.582 --> 14:45.117
and prove that I'm worthy.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.719
But I will. You'll see.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.690
I'm better now.

15:07.206 --> 15:08.940
Hey.

15:08.941 --> 15:10.942
Sure you wanna do this?

15:10.943 --> 15:13.979
Face it, Caleb. We were
never under the radar.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.813
Did you hear about Mona?

15:15.814 --> 15:17.216
Yeah, I did. Sorry I missed that.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.851
Something weird is going on.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.552
Do you think it's possible
that Mona did that to herself?

15:22.553 --> 15:24.990
It's possible, but something's
definitely going on

15:24.991 --> 15:26.891
between Mona and Lucas.

15:26.892 --> 15:29.561
- Why is he limping?
- Maybe she kicked him.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.629
You've gotta talk to him.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.565
Find out if he hurt that leg on Halloween.

15:33.566 --> 15:34.799
I'm lost.

15:37.736 --> 15:39.169
When Aria was in that box,

15:39.170 --> 15:41.473
she stabbed someone who was trying
to throw her off the train.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.574
That was weeks ago.

15:43.575 --> 15:46.908
And it was also a dirty old screwdriver.
Maybe it didn't heal.

15:49.715 --> 15:51.215
Just... please.

15:51.216 --> 15:53.117
Talk to him, okay?

15:54.119 --> 15:55.553
Okay.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.458
I couldn't pick up her call
because my phone was turned off.

16:03.762 --> 16:05.630
Dad, I have classes.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.164
I can't step out every ten minutes

16:07.165 --> 16:09.935
just to report to mom
that I'm still alive.

16:09.936 --> 16:11.970
No, not straight from school.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.938
I have work.

16:13.939 --> 16:16.508
I'm supposed to give up my job now, too?

16:19.678 --> 16:23.011
What? Yes, yes. I'll come
home right after work.

16:23.048 --> 16:25.049
Bye.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.691
Welcome to the Lost Woods resort.

16:36.929 --> 16:39.763
It would've been nice to
have had more warning,

16:39.764 --> 16:42.766
but we knew she couldn't
stay in that place forever.

16:42.767 --> 16:44.603
Do you still wanna run after school?

16:44.604 --> 16:45.737
Yeah, sure.

16:45.738 --> 16:48.806
I missed you.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.941
How come I didn't hear
from you last night?

16:50.942 --> 16:53.212
I fell asleep early.
Didn't get your message.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.880
Can I ask you something?

16:56.715 --> 16:59.117
Promise that you won't get upset.

16:59.118 --> 17:01.619
Ask.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.920
Do you think that Jenna
transferred schools

17:03.921 --> 17:06.690
because after Garrett, she was
afraid that she might be next?

17:06.691 --> 17:09.826
Jason is the last member of the N.A.T.
club left.

17:09.827 --> 17:11.028
I know that she wasn't an official...

17:11.029 --> 17:13.130
why do you obsess about this stuff?

17:13.131 --> 17:14.964
How can I not obsess about it?

17:14.965 --> 17:17.701
The cops still don't
know who killed Garrett.

17:17.702 --> 17:20.138
They can't even find the
gun he was shot with.

17:22.074 --> 17:23.674
Unbelievable.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.944
Look who she's cozying up to now.

17:26.945 --> 17:29.747
- Spencer, leave it alone.
- No, I can't.

17:29.748 --> 17:31.750
He's basically hugging a hand grenade.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.657
He was cleaning up Mona's locker.

17:39.658 --> 17:42.660
He looked right through me.

17:42.661 --> 17:45.064
- Maybe it wasn't him.
- It was him.

17:45.065 --> 17:48.398
Maybe creepy Harold has a creepy twin.

17:52.771 --> 17:54.639
( Music playing faintly )

18:00.813 --> 18:04.146
( Country music playing on radio )

18:07.820 --> 18:09.254
Why does he have Mona's stuff?

18:10.789 --> 18:12.691
- Maybe he's returning it.
- Shh!

18:32.811 --> 18:34.745
You've worn this?

18:34.746 --> 18:36.615
Yeah, in every marathon I've ever run.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.716
Here. Wear it.

18:38.717 --> 18:41.252
It'll bring you luck

18:41.253 --> 18:43.955
no. I can't take that.

18:43.956 --> 18:47.289
- What if I lose it?
- I'll have to lose you.

18:47.593 --> 18:49.627
That was a joke.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.762
- What's goin' on?
- Nothing.

18:51.763 --> 18:53.965
Nothing. I'm just...

18:53.966 --> 18:56.700
Guess I'm just deciding if I
really want to do this thing.

18:56.701 --> 18:58.835
No, no, no. You have to do this.

18:58.836 --> 19:01.605
It's for a good cause,
friends are counting on you,

19:01.606 --> 19:04.710
and I pledged half of
last year's unemployment.

19:04.711 --> 19:07.178
You'll be fine.

19:07.179 --> 19:10.214
Just... change your shoes.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.755
( Cell phone rings ) - What's wrong?

19:17.756 --> 19:19.825
Nothing. It just might be my mom.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.659
She called in sick today,

19:21.660 --> 19:24.730
but I'm guessing it's 'cause
it was Meredith's first day.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.934
- Is it your mom?
- Yeah.

19:29.935 --> 19:32.537
Yeah, I'm gonna have to...

19:32.538 --> 19:34.005
Swing by her place and do
a little hand holding.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.472
She's pretty bugged out.

19:35.473 --> 19:38.076
She's lucky to have you, since I can't.

19:40.245 --> 19:41.746
Call me?

19:43.549 --> 19:44.715
I will.

20:17.114 --> 20:19.983
Oh, under ten! Beat it.

20:19.984 --> 20:23.119
I think we earned some hot tub.

20:23.120 --> 20:26.122
Spence, you want me to fire it up?

20:28.158 --> 20:30.293
Yeah. Just give me a second.

20:33.531 --> 20:36.299
Hey, Jason.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.234
Hey there, Spencer.

20:38.235 --> 20:40.837
What's going on with you and Mona?

20:40.838 --> 20:43.440
Did you go to her or did
she come up to you?

20:45.242 --> 20:48.078
Look, I know that her first day
back wasn't exactly a bubble bath.

20:48.079 --> 20:50.013
Okay, but...

20:50.014 --> 20:51.482
You should be careful.

20:51.483 --> 20:54.816
What am I missing here?

20:54.818 --> 20:56.251
Just that she's dangerous.

20:56.252 --> 20:58.289
Ian and Garrett are both dead.

20:58.290 --> 21:00.223
Jenna's awol.

21:00.224 --> 21:02.090
I'm starting to think
that Mona might have...

21:02.091 --> 21:03.994
got it. I'll keep that in mind.

21:03.995 --> 21:06.763
Toby can hear this. He knows her resume.

21:06.764 --> 21:08.065
She once tried to kill him

21:08.066 --> 21:11.399
by unscrewing a piece of scaffolding.
She cannot be trusted.

21:11.969 --> 21:14.803
People around here used to
say the same thing about me.

21:14.804 --> 21:16.907
I like to give people the
benefit of the doubt

21:16.908 --> 21:19.042
before I cut them off.

21:19.043 --> 21:22.178
Good-bye. Thanks for the tip.

21:31.388 --> 21:33.957
You sure you didn't tell her?

21:33.958 --> 21:36.191
Why would I tell Mona that ezra has a kid?

21:36.192 --> 21:38.293
If ezra would've opened that door...

21:38.294 --> 21:40.062
he didn't, all right, so just breathe.

21:40.063 --> 21:41.930
What'd you do with the basket?

21:41.931 --> 21:44.032
I trashed it. Why? Did you
want the jelly beans?

21:44.033 --> 21:46.969
Aria's right, Hanna.
Mona's up to something.

21:46.970 --> 21:48.870
It's not a coincidence the
first day she's back,

21:48.871 --> 21:50.941
Harold's also there, and
somehow doesn't recognize us.

21:50.942 --> 21:53.309
I'm not saying it wasn't weird.

21:53.310 --> 21:56.111
I just think maybe he took the job
because he wanted to see her.

21:56.112 --> 21:58.246
- Why would he want to see her?
- She spent a lot of time there.

21:58.247 --> 22:00.484
- Maybe they were buddies.
- The buddy-moon's over.

22:00.485 --> 22:03.019
We need to bust into creepy's closet

22:03.020 --> 22:04.989
and see what else he saved for her.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.856
- Hey.
- Hi.

22:06.857 --> 22:09.524
- Did you talk to Lucas?
- He's not feeling very chatty.

22:09.525 --> 22:12.194
- But I did find something else.
- What is that?

22:12.195 --> 22:14.264
It's a transcript from the
meeting the principal had

22:14.265 --> 22:17.598
- with Mona and her parents last week.
- How did you get this?

22:18.068 --> 22:19.803
There's perks to knowing
the school's pass code.

22:19.804 --> 22:22.972
- What are we looking for?
- Page two.

22:22.973 --> 22:25.874
Turns out Mona's parents did not want
her to come back to Rosewood High.

22:25.875 --> 22:27.943
It was Mona who begged to come back in.

22:27.944 --> 22:30.514
Wait. I thought she told you
her parents were forcing her.

22:30.515 --> 22:33.848
I'm guessing she lied. Mona's back
to take care of unfinished business.

22:33.984 --> 22:35.852
I gotta go.

22:35.853 --> 22:37.987
Hey, feed me. I'm starving.

22:37.988 --> 22:41.321
Did Mona sign that card on the
muffin basket with "M" or "A"?

22:41.425 --> 22:43.525
- Could we just take a second before we...
- Before we what?

22:43.526 --> 22:45.894
- Let her destroy our lives again?
- No.

22:45.895 --> 22:47.531
If ezra finds out that he
has a kid through "a"...

22:47.532 --> 22:50.865
don't give "a" all the power, Aria.
Tell Fitz he has a son.

22:51.001 --> 22:52.435
- I can't.
- Why not?

22:52.436 --> 22:54.302
Because that son has a mother,
and she asked me not to.

22:54.303 --> 22:56.306
Yeah, and every day that
goes by is another day

22:56.307 --> 22:59.242
that kid goes without meeting his dad,

22:59.243 --> 23:00.910
and believe me,

23:00.911 --> 23:03.881
that kid might be dealing
with it for a long time.

23:30.908 --> 23:33.242
What are you thinking about?

23:33.243 --> 23:35.411
I'm not.

23:38.916 --> 23:41.551
What are you stewing about?

23:41.552 --> 23:44.885
Why doesn't Jason get it?

23:44.955 --> 23:46.922
He knows that Mona's dangerous.

23:46.923 --> 23:49.925
Jason's a big boy. He can
take care of himself.

23:49.926 --> 23:52.096
Yeah, but nobody's got his back.

23:52.097 --> 23:55.430
I've got my friends, I've got you.
He's completely alone.

24:00.471 --> 24:02.538
What was that?

24:02.539 --> 24:04.340
Did you hear that?

24:05.509 --> 24:06.909
Hello?

24:09.113 --> 24:10.848
Hey, is someone out there?

24:19.790 --> 24:21.457
Relax.

24:27.097 --> 24:29.065
I wanna go inside.

24:29.066 --> 24:31.502
I'm sorry. I can't do this right now.

24:39.042 --> 24:41.911
( Knocking on door ) - Come in.

24:41.912 --> 24:43.546
Hi there.

24:43.547 --> 24:46.850
I wasn't even sure anyone
was home, it's so quiet.

24:46.851 --> 24:49.118
Mike went to Wyatt's to study.

24:51.088 --> 24:54.323
So... how was school today?

24:59.363 --> 25:01.031
Did you talk to Meredith?

25:01.032 --> 25:02.431
I did.

25:02.432 --> 25:04.766
I'd completely forgotten
that you were in that class.

25:04.767 --> 25:07.905
- I can't drop it. I need it to graduate.
- Why should you?

25:07.906 --> 25:11.239
Sounds like you handled that
situation like an adult.

25:11.942 --> 25:13.376
Thank you for that.

25:13.377 --> 25:15.812
What did Meredith tell you?

25:15.813 --> 25:18.382
Well, she said that you and your friends

25:18.383 --> 25:21.017
were cautiously welcoming.

25:21.018 --> 25:24.351
That's the most that any
new teacher can expect.

25:24.555 --> 25:27.323
God knows, I have been there.

25:28.392 --> 25:30.526
Kids can be very cruel.

25:32.462 --> 25:35.164
Hey, dad.

25:35.165 --> 25:37.934
Did you like Alison?

25:37.935 --> 25:40.036
What?

25:40.037 --> 25:43.339
Like, what did you think
of her as a person?

25:43.340 --> 25:46.673
I like all of your friends.

25:46.777 --> 25:49.011
Why do you ask that?

25:49.012 --> 25:52.345
I just know that mom had
some issues with her.

25:52.883 --> 25:54.884
She thought Ali was entitled.

25:56.086 --> 25:58.788
I think most of that just comes from

25:58.789 --> 26:01.357
being at an awkward age.

26:04.895 --> 26:08.228
You never spent any real time
alone with her, though, did you?

26:11.034 --> 26:12.768
Why would I have?

26:17.474 --> 26:20.076
You still really miss her, huh?

26:21.912 --> 26:24.080
Yeah.

26:48.038 --> 26:50.941
Ever since I was little, and
all through junior high,

26:50.942 --> 26:54.043
I was considered a loser.

26:54.044 --> 26:57.179
I was humiliated, picked on,

26:57.180 --> 26:59.348
and tortured.

26:59.349 --> 27:02.386
And as hard as all that
misery and torture was...

27:02.387 --> 27:05.720
( Crying )

27:07.824 --> 27:10.393
She sent this to you?

27:10.394 --> 27:12.095
Yeah, and everyone else in cyber space.

27:12.096 --> 27:14.363
It has 1,600 likes.

27:14.364 --> 27:16.865
That child is more twisted than my toes.

27:16.866 --> 27:18.166
She's trying way too hard.

27:18.167 --> 27:20.802
You were the one who told me
to give her a second chance.

27:20.803 --> 27:22.537
That was before I saw her campaign.

27:22.538 --> 27:25.275
Right now, I think Mona may
be the best argument we got

27:25.276 --> 27:27.777
against human cloning.

27:30.847 --> 27:32.514
Before you turn this off,

27:32.515 --> 27:34.384
or throw something at the screen,

27:34.385 --> 27:36.285
please just hear me out.

27:36.286 --> 27:38.553
I've been in Radley for
over seven months now.

27:38.554 --> 27:41.091
- ( Knocking on door )
- And I wanna tell you about what I...

27:41.092 --> 27:43.059
( stops video )

27:44.294 --> 27:45.928
Lucas?

27:45.929 --> 27:49.197
- Hi. I know you're on your way out.
- No, no. Come in.

27:49.198 --> 27:52.369
- I don't wanna keep you.
- Seriously, just come in.

27:58.175 --> 27:59.541
Could you get this to Caleb?

27:59.542 --> 28:02.777
I tried to find him, but I guess
he's not living in the same spot.

28:02.778 --> 28:04.479
- What is this?
- It's the last of the money I owe him.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.248
Took me a while to get it.

28:06.249 --> 28:08.552
Do you want something
to drink or anything?

28:08.553 --> 28:10.252
No, I'm good.

28:10.253 --> 28:11.455
What happened to your leg?

28:11.456 --> 28:14.390
Oh, I had an accident skateboarding.

28:14.391 --> 28:16.892
It's kind of hard to explain.

28:19.796 --> 28:21.064
What happened between you and Mona?

28:21.065 --> 28:23.799
Nothing. Nothing.

28:23.800 --> 28:24.966
I haven't spoken to her in months.

28:24.967 --> 28:27.270
Does Mona have something on you, Lucas?

28:27.271 --> 28:30.539
Did you do something
that you really regret?

28:30.540 --> 28:33.308
Did someone stab you in
that leg on Halloween?

28:33.309 --> 28:36.511
- We'll talk about this another time.
- No, I need answers.

28:36.512 --> 28:39.049
Why is she suddenly back at school?
Why is she coming back?

28:39.050 --> 28:42.218
Hanna, yesterday wasn't
her first day back.

28:42.219 --> 28:45.552
She was sneaking out of there way
before she had the doctor's permission.

28:45.555 --> 28:48.525
Why? Where was she going?
What was she doing?

28:48.526 --> 28:50.526
I'm sorry.

28:50.527 --> 28:52.562
I'm sorry. That's the best that I can do.

28:54.031 --> 28:55.498
Okay. I get it.

28:57.434 --> 28:59.201
I miss you.

29:01.772 --> 29:02.905
I miss you, too.

29:15.919 --> 29:19.021
I know that you ultimately have to own up.

29:19.022 --> 29:21.824
Own up to what you've done,

29:21.825 --> 29:24.894
and what's been done to you,

29:24.895 --> 29:27.830
and then you have to learn to forgive...

29:27.831 --> 29:29.465
she shoots, she scores.

29:29.466 --> 29:31.100
Un-freakin'-believable.

29:31.101 --> 29:33.369
By Tuesday, that'll be playing

29:33.370 --> 29:35.439
in airports and doctor's offices.

29:37.107 --> 29:39.775
We need more bottles.

29:47.250 --> 29:49.085
I don't believe it.

29:52.222 --> 29:54.323
What is she doing here?

29:57.494 --> 29:58.527
Spence.

30:00.030 --> 30:02.531
Hey, Spencer, how are you?

30:02.532 --> 30:04.400
I'm good. How are you?

30:08.505 --> 30:09.973
She's such a piece of work.

30:09.974 --> 30:13.142
Yep. That's called greeting your converts.

30:16.780 --> 30:18.514
Can I ask you something?

30:23.820 --> 30:25.087
Have you ever...

30:25.088 --> 30:27.257
Thought about what your life would be like

30:27.258 --> 30:29.558
if your dad had been around

30:29.559 --> 30:31.894
when you were, like, six or seven?

30:33.830 --> 30:36.765
Dumb question. I shouldn't
have asked that.

30:36.766 --> 30:39.835
No. No, it wasn't dumb.

30:39.836 --> 30:41.871
When I was young,

30:41.872 --> 30:45.007
I... I looked for him everywhere.

30:45.008 --> 30:48.210
In the streets, in stores.

30:48.211 --> 30:51.213
I even looked for him in my sleep.

30:53.150 --> 30:56.483
But when I was about 13, I just stopped.

30:56.853 --> 30:58.420
Why?

30:58.421 --> 31:01.754
I guess I was just tired of...

31:02.092 --> 31:03.960
Using all that energy, ya know.

31:03.961 --> 31:06.428
I just needed to focus on me.

31:08.532 --> 31:10.867
And I'm totally fine with
the way things turned out.

31:10.868 --> 31:12.468
Really.

31:12.469 --> 31:15.337
But... I'd be lying

31:15.338 --> 31:17.339
if I said there weren't days

31:17.340 --> 31:20.443
that I wish I could replace
the guy I made up in my head

31:20.444 --> 31:22.378
with a real person.

31:30.554 --> 31:32.954
Woman on P.A.: If you look at your maps,

31:32.955 --> 31:34.524
you'll see four checkpoint stations.

31:34.525 --> 31:37.426
The run will end in front of the school,

31:37.427 --> 31:39.360
where you'll pick up your medal

31:39.361 --> 31:40.995
and a complimentary swag bag.

31:40.996 --> 31:42.964
We will begin in three minutes.

31:42.965 --> 31:45.033
Excuse me. Who's singing
the national anthem?

31:45.034 --> 31:46.836

- I'll do that.

31:51.942 --> 31:55.275

we can cut through the
woods behind school.

31:57.012 --> 31:58.446
How are we getting in?

31:58.447 --> 32:00.481
It's not locked. They're keeping
the bathrooms open for people

32:00.482 --> 32:02.283
that are working the finish line.

32:02.284 --> 32:04.018
Are you sure that Emily can't meet us?

32:04.019 --> 32:06.456
Yeah, unless she can escape fort fields.

32:06.457 --> 32:09.291

32:42.358 --> 32:45.560
Yeah. Is there an app to let
me crack open a window?

32:45.561 --> 32:48.431
Don't need to. I'll adjust
the thermostat downstairs.

33:12.989 --> 33:14.590
Okay, I'll be back in a couple of hours.

33:47.524 --> 33:49.191
Emily?

33:49.192 --> 33:50.926
Em, how did you get here?

33:50.927 --> 33:52.527
Long story. Just do me a favor.

33:52.528 --> 33:54.331
Don't call or text me until tomorrow.

33:54.332 --> 33:55.764
This isn't working.

33:55.765 --> 33:57.033
That's because it's a paper clip.

33:57.034 --> 33:59.068
You have to use a Bobby pin.

33:59.069 --> 34:01.136
Have I taught you nothing?

34:11.447 --> 34:13.483
The bag was right here, wasn't it?

34:19.989 --> 34:22.458
That's the book he was writing in.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.393
What does it say?

34:25.395 --> 34:28.029
Looks like he was writing
a long letter to Mona,

34:28.030 --> 34:30.164
'cause he thinks that
this is her diary. - Is it?

34:30.165 --> 34:31.498
Was this in the motel room?

34:31.500 --> 34:33.902
Yeah, it was, but, you
guys, this isn't Mona's.

34:33.904 --> 34:36.371
This is Ali's.

34:55.158 --> 34:57.427
Is this the same one you
saw in Mona's lair?

34:59.796 --> 35:01.965
- I'm positive.
- Let me see this.

35:01.966 --> 35:04.433
Aria, is this about your dad?

35:07.837 --> 35:10.406
So you're department chair now.

35:10.407 --> 35:13.409
You're a powerful man, Mr. Montgomery.

35:15.512 --> 35:18.347
We're not having this conversation again.

35:18.348 --> 35:21.383
Fine. I'd rather not talk.

35:21.384 --> 35:23.819
That's gonna cost you.

35:25.155 --> 35:27.488
- Same amount works for me.
- Oh, does it?

35:27.489 --> 35:29.090
Well, you're out of luck.

35:29.091 --> 35:31.127
That person's not in my life anymore.

35:31.128 --> 35:32.494
It ended months ago.

35:32.495 --> 35:34.329
Oh.

35:34.330 --> 35:37.663
Will that make it any easier for Mrs.
Montgomery?

35:38.168 --> 35:40.402
I mean, it did happen.

35:40.403 --> 35:41.938
It's time for you to go, Alison.

35:41.939 --> 35:44.306
If a student called the Dean

35:44.307 --> 35:46.174
and told him that
Meredith was flipping out

35:46.175 --> 35:47.510
because one of her professors

35:47.511 --> 35:49.945
wiped his feet on her after he...

35:49.946 --> 35:52.348
you make that call, you'll be very sorry.

35:52.349 --> 35:55.682
You're right. I'll just
start with your wife.

36:08.531 --> 36:10.799
Maybe I'll call when I'm alone.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.367
I cannot give you that
kind of money again.

36:13.368 --> 36:14.902
Ella will know it's missing.

36:14.903 --> 36:17.307
You can take some time to figure it out.

36:17.308 --> 36:20.641
I'm leaving town to visit my Nana.

36:20.910 --> 36:22.445
I'll be back labor day weekend.

36:22.446 --> 36:24.146
Does that work for you?

36:24.147 --> 36:26.949
Excellent. I'll see you then.

36:31.287 --> 36:34.156
Have a nice week, Mr. Montgomery.

36:46.169 --> 36:48.337
Aria - don't.

36:48.338 --> 36:51.038
- ( Door slamming )
- Emily, put this in your jacket.

36:51.039 --> 36:52.773
Maybe we should leave it here.

36:52.774 --> 36:54.976
If he knows that it's missing,
he'll think it was one of us.

36:54.977 --> 36:56.978
Us? He doesn't even know who you are.

36:56.979 --> 36:58.448
- Just take it.
- Give it to me.

37:04.254 --> 37:06.055
What are you doing down here?

37:07.423 --> 37:10.756
Um, all of the bathrooms
upstairs were full,

37:10.994 --> 37:13.897
so we came down here, but we can
use the ones on the second floor.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.331
We're sorry. You guys, come on.

37:19.836 --> 37:21.971
- What have you got there?
- Give it to me!

37:23.172 --> 37:26.074
Spencer?

37:26.075 --> 37:29.277
- What's going on? Are you guys okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

37:29.278 --> 37:31.439
We just had to get something
I accidentally threw away.

37:38.955 --> 37:40.388
Thank God you came down there.

37:40.389 --> 37:42.089
How did you know we were there?

37:42.090 --> 37:43.958
I got to the finish line early,

37:43.959 --> 37:46.794
and then, I saw the three of
you go in that back door.

37:46.795 --> 37:49.076
It doesn't even matter. We're
just so lucky you were here.

37:50.967 --> 37:53.335
( Explosion, woman screaming )

37:53.336 --> 37:54.336
Oh, my God!

37:54.337 --> 37:55.804
Woman: Mona!

37:57.974 --> 38:00.342
- Man: Get back!
- Mona!

38:09.055 --> 38:11.657
No, I didn't get any messages.

38:11.658 --> 38:13.959
Only my daughter's.

38:13.960 --> 38:16.161
We accidentally switched phones.

38:16.162 --> 38:17.696
That's right.

38:17.697 --> 38:20.999
Thanks for the update, sir. Good night.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.168
That was your principal.

38:23.169 --> 38:26.438
It was that new teacher, miss Sorenson,

38:26.439 --> 38:28.473
- who got hurt by that stunt.
- Meredith?

38:28.474 --> 38:30.510
You call her by her first name?

38:30.511 --> 38:33.679
No, I just... she's...

38:33.680 --> 38:36.014
Never mind.

38:38.017 --> 38:41.019
All right. Maybe we should stop fighting

38:41.020 --> 38:42.987
about why I won't let you out,

38:42.988 --> 38:45.258
and start talking about why
you're not letting me in.

38:47.994 --> 38:50.362
Have I been gone that long?

38:54.300 --> 38:56.667
Emmy, I know that I don't fully understand

38:56.668 --> 38:59.072
everything that you've been going through.

39:01.174 --> 39:04.409
But I know what it's like to lose people.

39:06.079 --> 39:08.412
And the only thing that
gets me through that

39:08.413 --> 39:11.017
is knowing that I'm
coming home to my family.

39:19.092 --> 39:21.261
I don't wanna be your gate keeper, Emma.

39:21.262 --> 39:23.462
I wanna be your dad.

39:36.576 --> 39:39.909
Ever since I was little, and
all through junior high...

39:43.383 --> 39:45.317
Baby.

39:45.318 --> 39:48.288
I think you've seen enough of
her for one day, don't you?

39:59.699 --> 40:01.233
( Knocking at door )

40:05.371 --> 40:06.505
How's Meredith?

40:06.506 --> 40:09.608
I just took her home from the E.R.

40:09.609 --> 40:11.175
Doctors dressed her burn,

40:11.176 --> 40:13.379
gave her some painkillers, kept her calm.

40:13.380 --> 40:16.215
I didn't think she should be home alone,

40:16.216 --> 40:18.051
so I invited her to stay over.

40:18.052 --> 40:19.384
- She's here?
- No.

40:19.385 --> 40:21.354
No, she didn't see that
as a very tempting offer,

40:21.355 --> 40:24.423
based on what happened earlier tonight.

40:25.425 --> 40:27.626
What is it?

40:33.266 --> 40:35.068
It was put on Meredith's clipboard,

40:35.069 --> 40:38.270
sending her over to the storage shed.

40:38.271 --> 40:41.172
- Did one of your friends write that?
- My friends?

40:41.173 --> 40:42.976
I know what they're capable of.

40:42.977 --> 40:45.577
What are you saying?

40:48.081 --> 40:49.732
Does Meredith think
that we sent this to her?

40:49.733 --> 40:51.382
Yeah, she sure does.

40:51.383 --> 40:54.585
Now that she's told me the truth about
what happened on that first day,

40:54.586 --> 40:56.287
I don't think it's such a crazy thought.

40:56.288 --> 40:59.092
- Dad, we would never...
- Did you and your friends do this to her?

40:59.093 --> 41:01.226
Yes or no?

41:01.227 --> 41:03.328
No.

41:03.329 --> 41:06.198
No. Speak up now, Aria, while you can.

41:06.199 --> 41:09.201
These kind of secrets
come back to haunt us.

41:09.202 --> 41:10.270
What about yours?

41:11.604 --> 41:13.272
What does that mean?

41:15.508 --> 41:16.575
Nothing.

41:16.576 --> 41:19.344
Nothing.

41:19.345 --> 41:22.180
Will you close my door, please?

41:35.295 --> 41:37.195
( Zapping noise )

41:41.467 --> 41:43.101
Hey.

41:47.273 --> 41:50.343
Heard I missed some fireworks
at the finish line.

41:50.344 --> 41:52.110
Yeah.

41:52.111 --> 41:55.213
But Mona walked away without a scratch.

41:59.652 --> 42:02.388
- Look, I won't say this again.
- You don't have to.

42:02.389 --> 42:05.290
I hear you this time.

42:11.331 --> 42:13.198
Good night.

42:16.002 --> 42:17.669
( Cell phone rings )

42:20.406 --> 42:22.040
Hey, Aria, what's up?

42:24.310 --> 42:25.543
"A" set us up.
What?

42:25.544 --> 42:27.478
That's why Meredith opened that shed.

42:27.479 --> 42:29.547
"A" sent her over there, and
made it look like we did.

42:29.548 --> 42:31.349
Does "a" go by the name of Mona?

42:31.350 --> 42:34.618
Is this her way of proving
to us that she's worthy?

42:34.619 --> 42:36.120
- Hey, I gotta go.
- Wait, Aria.

42:36.121 --> 42:39.256
Is it your dad? Do you wanna
come over and stay at my place?

42:39.257 --> 42:41.260
He's never gonna let that happen.

42:50.819 --> 42:54.735
I think this bandage will cover it.

42:54.736 --> 42:56.571
Ouch.

43:39.167 --> 43:40.599
( Screaming )

43:40.719 --> 43:45.759
