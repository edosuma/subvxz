WEBVTT

00:07.466 --> 00:08.801
(GRUNTS)

00:08.843 --> 00:10.010
Thought you'd already
left for work.

00:10.051 --> 00:11.386
Well, the meeting
got canceled.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.221
So I was hoping
to schedule a meeting for us.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.307
In the...boudoir.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.311
Hmm.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.313
I may have
a little time to discuss
some new business.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.357
Hmm.

00:23.398 --> 00:26.652
Let the minutes show
the wife is up for it.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.029
Hmm.
Minutes, plural?

00:29.070 --> 00:30.155
That'd be a nice change.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.659
(RINGTONE PLAYS)

00:34.493 --> 00:35.786
Please don't answer that.

00:35.828 --> 00:37.579
Hello.
Meeting adjourned.

00:39.874 --> 00:42.083
Really?
I'm... I'm so sorry.

00:42.125 --> 00:44.336
Let me check with Jeff,
and I'll get back to you.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.087
That was Chrissy.
She never got
the Knicks tickets

00:46.129 --> 00:47.882
you promised her
for her charity auction.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.925
Oh, boy, uh,
you'll never guess
what happened.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.468
You forgot?

00:51.510 --> 00:52.887
Wow, first guess.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.097
Look, she was really
counting on that.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.892
Can you still
get 'em?
When's the auction?

00:57.933 --> 00:59.434
Tomorrow.
One day's notice?

00:59.476 --> 01:01.228
You got to give me
more time than that.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.146
I asked you
six weeks ago!

01:03.188 --> 01:04.272
That's too much notice.

01:04.314 --> 01:05.900
Ten days,
that's your sweet spot.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.904
Oh, my God.
What?
What is that?

01:09.945 --> 01:11.864
(SCOFFS)
The form you said
you would fill out.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.448
This puts our baby
on our insurance.

01:14.909 --> 01:16.201
So excited.

01:17.703 --> 01:19.413
God, I feel like
a single mother.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.582
Okay, just tell me,
what can I do?

01:21.623 --> 01:24.334
Anything.
Fill out a form,
empty the dishwasher.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.836
Make a dinner
reservation.
Okay, I'll do it.

01:25.878 --> 01:26.795
Do what?

01:29.548 --> 01:31.508
What was the last one?
Oh, God.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.385
No, wait.
Dinner reservation,
I'll make one of those.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.095
What's that, uh,
fancy new French place

01:36.137 --> 01:37.389
you've been
going on about?

01:37.431 --> 01:38.974
Dijon?
Boom!

01:39.016 --> 01:40.475
Gonna make
a reservation for us.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.810
Yeah, well,
it takes a month
to get in there.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.270
All right, then,
write it down.

01:43.311 --> 01:45.397
One month from today,
you and I are going
to, uh...

01:47.900 --> 01:50.193
Dijon.
That's the one!

01:50.235 --> 01:51.695
I'll call and make
a reservation.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.405
It's happenin' right now.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.489
So you never made
the reservation?

01:54.531 --> 01:55.866
No, I did not.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.453
I meant to call,
but then my buddy
texted me

01:59.494 --> 02:01.371
with this sweet
fantasy baseball trade.

02:02.706 --> 02:03.999
So, how pissed was Audrey?

02:04.041 --> 02:07.044
I mean, was she, like,
Yosemite Sam pissed?

02:07.086 --> 02:09.046
Yeah, what was up
with that guy?

02:09.088 --> 02:10.672
I heard he was bipolar
or something.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.633
Yeah.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.260
Look, obviously,
I haven't told her yet.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.303
Why?

02:17.638 --> 02:19.681
Is anything
obvious to you?

02:20.808 --> 02:23.936
Because if Audrey
doesn't know about it,

02:23.978 --> 02:25.938
it's not a screw-up yet.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.648
Like when a tree
falls in the forest.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.691
If there's nobody
there to hear it,

02:29.733 --> 02:31.318
it doesn't make a noise.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.113
Of course, it does.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.033
How do you know,
if there was nobody
there to hear it?

02:38.075 --> 02:40.119
Well, because,
Jeff, I mean...

02:40.160 --> 02:41.620
You know, when, like...

02:44.247 --> 02:45.457
Whoa.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.919
Exactly. Now,
I still have a day

02:48.961 --> 02:50.378
to try to get
into that restaurant.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.798
So the tree
hasn't fallen yet.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.969
Yeah, hey,
I get that.

02:59.471 --> 03:00.722
I don't get that.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.312
♪ How many ways
to say I love you?

03:10.189 --> 03:12.943
♪ How many ways
to say that I'm not scared?

03:14.653 --> 03:19.700
♪ With you by my side
There is no denying

03:19.741 --> 03:21.994
♪ I can't wait
for me and you ♪

03:31.086 --> 03:32.087
Ah.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.173
Good morning, sir.

03:34.213 --> 03:36.466
Why the toothy grin there,
Squanto?

03:36.508 --> 03:38.010
No reason in particular.

03:38.844 --> 03:39.678
Just go in your office.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.471
Oh.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.683
Is there a bee in there?

03:46.434 --> 03:47.853
What? No.

03:47.895 --> 03:48.979
'Cause there was
a bee in there once,

03:49.021 --> 03:50.022
and it was not
a good day for me.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.439
I was not proud
of how I reacted.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.275
I assure you,
there is no bee.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.194
Just go in.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.653
No bee.

04:01.449 --> 04:02.659
(SINGSONG)
Hey, ex-hubby.

04:02.701 --> 04:03.869
Oh, yuck.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.788
Come on, dude. Liz?

04:06.830 --> 04:08.540
Why'd you let her
in my office?

04:08.582 --> 04:10.667
Because I take pleasure
in your misery, sir.

04:10.709 --> 04:13.087
Liz is such a nightmare.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.379
What do you think?
Should I bang her?

04:15.714 --> 04:17.507
Absolutely not.

04:17.549 --> 04:19.051
Yeah,
I'm on the fence too.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.552
See, I promised myself

04:20.594 --> 04:22.054
I'd only bang nines
from now on.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.722
And Liz is a three.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.140
I'm being generous.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.976
So, if we do it
three times,
that would...

04:30.395 --> 04:32.147
Crunch those numbers
for me, Timmy.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.481
Three times three
is nine, sir.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.649
It is? Ooh!

04:34.691 --> 04:35.943
Hold my calls.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.238
Okay, Liz,
you're in luck.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.782
'Cause I'm in a bit
of a slump, and,
according to Timmy,

04:41.823 --> 04:44.743
the numbers check out,
so let's do this.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.246
Russell,
I'm here because I have
something to tell you.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.706
I am a sex addict.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.542
Well, listen,
if you gots to have it,

04:52.584 --> 04:55.170
(SINGSONG)
then I gots to give it.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.172
No, you're not
hearing me, Russell.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.966
I joined
Sex Addicts Anonymous.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.968
And part of the program
is apologizing

05:01.009 --> 05:01.802
to those I wronged.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.345
I'm not here to make love.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.847
I'm here to talk.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.348
Well, can we talk
in-between?

05:07.390 --> 05:08.725
'Cause we gots
to do this three times

05:08.767 --> 05:09.935
to make the numbers work.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.982
Adam, everyone's heard
of wedding cake.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.483
Nobody's ever
heard of wedding pie.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.568
'Cause I am in the process
of inventing it.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.028
Okay, Tim, you go
to a wedding, right?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.404
It's dessert time.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.364
Now, do you want...

05:23.406 --> 05:26.034
(YAWNING)
...boring old
wedding cake?

05:26.076 --> 05:27.410
Or do you want
to break me off

05:27.452 --> 05:29.496
a sweet slice of that
wedding pie, bro?

05:31.790 --> 05:34.584
He only wants pie
so a pie fight
will break out.

05:34.626 --> 05:35.919
You can't have
a table full of pies

05:35.961 --> 05:37.462
and not expect
a pie fight.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.881
That's why
I don't want pie!

05:39.923 --> 05:42.717
God, sometimes
I feel like I'm marrying
Larry, Moe, and Curly.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.761
I'm sorry, who?

05:44.803 --> 05:45.887
The three stooges.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.681
Ah, yes.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.267
I've heard of them,
but I've never seen
any of their films.

05:50.309 --> 05:51.643
Oh, my God,
not even the one
where they're plumbers,

05:51.685 --> 05:52.644
and everything goes wrong?

05:53.478 --> 05:54.896
No.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.606
What about when
they're in the old West,

05:56.648 --> 05:58.066
and everything goes wrong?

05:59.234 --> 06:01.360
Maybe I wasn't clear,
Mr. Rhodes.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.404
When I said I'd never
seen any of their films,

06:03.446 --> 06:04.363
I meant that.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.826
Aw, T, that's it.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.703
What's it?
Oh, please don't.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.538
Too late.
(CLAPS HANDS)

06:11.579 --> 06:14.373
Tonight. My house.
It's stooge night.

06:14.415 --> 06:15.917
I have no doubt
about that, sir.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.296
It got so bad that,

06:19.338 --> 06:21.256
even in the short amount
of time we were married,

06:21.298 --> 06:22.674
I was unable
to remain faithful.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.384
Whoa.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.888
So, uh...

06:29.306 --> 06:30.182
Who's the guy?

06:30.724 --> 06:32.809
Guy? Singular?

06:32.851 --> 06:34.393
(CHUCKLES)

06:34.435 --> 06:35.229
How many were there?

06:38.397 --> 06:40.525
Can you count 'em
on one hand?

06:40.567 --> 06:42.694
Well, yes, if that one hand
was holding a calculator.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.072
Let's see,
there was, um,

06:45.113 --> 06:46.781
the guy who rents
boats in the park,

06:46.823 --> 06:48.575
an assistant manager
at Arby's,

06:48.616 --> 06:49.951
and a couple of waiters.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.870
Arby's doesn't have waiters.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.705
No, I mean people
literally waiting

06:53.747 --> 06:55.165
for me and
the assistant manager
to finish.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.458
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.418
I know now,
from my sex addiction
meetings,

06:59.460 --> 07:01.213
that I was just
trying to fill a void.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.964
Did you have to fill it
so many times?

07:09.096 --> 07:11.139
Oh, really?
You can give me a table?

07:11.181 --> 07:13.225
Oh, my God, you may have
just saved my marriage.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.853
4:45 or 11:30?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.566
At 4:45, will I still
get the lunch prices?

07:23.610 --> 07:24.736
Hello?

07:26.405 --> 07:27.614
Hey.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.907
Ah, I'm so excited.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.242
I got my new dress
for tomorrow night.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.576
Oh, I am really
fired up, too.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.494
In fact, I don't know
if I can wait until 8:00.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.455
Uh, hey, here,
new thought.

07:35.496 --> 07:36.998
What if they can
take us earlier?

07:37.040 --> 07:38.541
What, like, 7:30?

07:38.583 --> 07:40.335
7:30, 4:45,
somewhere in there.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.088
4:45?

07:43.130 --> 07:44.881
No, you're right,
later's better.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.716
Maybe we go at 11:30.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.010
Catch the local news first,

07:49.052 --> 07:50.470
have something
to talk about.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.016
I want to eat at 8:00
like we planned.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.518
Then that is
when you will eat.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.562
All right, do you want
to see my new dress now,

07:59.604 --> 08:02.232
or, uh, do you want
to be surprised
tomorrow night?

08:02.274 --> 08:04.484
Let's save all the surprises
for tomorrow night.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.238
(LAUGHS)

08:08.280 --> 08:09.281
Oh!

08:11.825 --> 08:12.993
Why aren't you laughing?

08:14.161 --> 08:16.037
I just don't get it,
Mr. Rhodes.

08:16.079 --> 08:19.333
Oh, no, it's okay, Tim.
Took me a while, too.

08:19.374 --> 08:22.294
Okay, see, the society lady,
she's having a party, right.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.503
But she's got a problem
with her plumbing.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.546
I understand that.
Okay.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.548
What I don't get
is why anyone would hire

08:27.590 --> 08:29.509
these buffoons as plumbers.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.678
I can't imagine
they're licensed or bonded.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.805
And if there's so much
acrimony among them,

08:33.847 --> 08:35.807
why don't they just
go their separate ways?

08:35.849 --> 08:37.017
Whoa! Oh!

08:39.394 --> 08:42.605
(STAMMERS)
Moe just hit Curly
in the head with a pipe.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.773
You don't think
that's funny?

08:43.815 --> 08:45.317
No, I think
it's attempted murder.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.158
(EXHALES)

08:53.200 --> 08:54.701
Oh, hey, so...

08:54.742 --> 08:56.411
Manage to get into
that fancy restaurant yet?

08:56.453 --> 08:58.038
No, and running
out of time.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.998
Soon the other shoe's
gonna drop.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.000
Ah.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.793
But is there anyone
there to hear it?

09:05.212 --> 09:06.129
Dude, we're not
doing that anymore.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.340
No?

09:08.382 --> 09:11.259
When Audrey finds
out I've blown it,
I'm a dead man.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.512
Be a long time before
Daddy gets any lovin'.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.015
You know, it's too bad
you're not a celebrity.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.433
You know, they get
these last-minute
tables all the time.

09:18.475 --> 09:19.767
Really?
Yeah.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.853
True. I've gotten
Mr. Dunbar into places

09:21.895 --> 09:23.522
claiming he was a celebrity.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.982
Yeah, what happens
when this no-name
loser schlub shows up?

09:26.024 --> 09:28.568
Ah, none taken.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.405
The key is to find
someone he looks
enough like.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.323
Mmm.
Tom Petty.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.202
Macaulay Culkin.

09:39.454 --> 09:41.998
And the age-old standby,
Ellen DeGeneres.

09:42.040 --> 09:42.957
(CLICKS TONGUE)

09:43.750 --> 09:44.667
Ellen? Really?

09:47.421 --> 09:48.505
Oh, yeah.

09:48.547 --> 09:49.797
Huh.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.925
All right,
I'm outta here.

09:51.966 --> 09:56.346
Where are you going?
Put on a pants suit
and go tape your show?

09:56.388 --> 09:59.516
No, I'm gonna meet Liz
at her Sex Addicts
Anonymous meeting.

09:59.558 --> 10:02.643
Ah, she finally convinced
you to go get help, sir.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.938
No, she convinced me
somewhere there's a room
full of nymphos

10:04.979 --> 10:06.356
with no impulse control.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.026
And if they
gots to have it...

10:10.068 --> 10:11.570
ALL: You gots to give it.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.946
Yeah, I gots to give it!

10:19.827 --> 10:21.996
Ah, you look fantastic.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.707
Thank you.
What's in the bag?

10:24.749 --> 10:27.586
Just got something
to make the night
a little more fun.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.379
Honey, you know
the restaurant
already has scotch.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.257
I love your sense of humor.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.301
I was thinking
that any old idiot

10:34.342 --> 10:35.427
can make
a dinner reservation.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.805
Yeah. You proved that.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.433
But I thought
that we'd take it
to a whole new level.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.435
And do a little
role playing.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.020
All right, Jeff,
could you just pretend

10:46.062 --> 10:47.314
to be interested
in the dinner

10:47.355 --> 10:49.690
instead of just
what happens back
at the apartment?

10:49.732 --> 10:52.569
I'm not just talking
about what happens
after dinner,

10:52.611 --> 10:54.028
I'm talking about
role-playing the whole night.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.406
Really?

10:56.448 --> 10:59.200
What, uh...
What role did
you have in mind?

10:59.242 --> 11:01.995
What's say tonight
you are Nicole Kidman?

11:04.205 --> 11:05.999
(LAUGHS)

11:06.040 --> 11:08.126
Well,
how oddly specific.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.631
Uh, so you want me
to wear this to
the restaurant?

11:12.671 --> 11:13.590
Yes, I do, Nicole.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.510
(LAUGHS)

11:17.302 --> 11:18.136
Seems pretty weird.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.514
Fun weird.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.225
All right,
I like that
you're trying.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.143
Are you gonna
be somebody too?

11:26.603 --> 11:27.728
I could,
if there was somebody...

11:27.770 --> 11:28.813
Yeah, Daniel Craig.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.360
You had that one locked
and loaded, did ya?

11:41.618 --> 11:42.952
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

11:45.872 --> 11:47.374
Russell.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.125
You listened to me
and came.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.002
Well, I realized
you were right.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.296
Maybe I could become
a better person somehow

11:53.338 --> 11:55.089
by... Jeez,
what a sausage hang.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.091
Where's all the talent?

11:57.133 --> 11:58.343
Hello.
Uh-uh.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.389
Look, if you're not
here to get help,

12:02.430 --> 12:05.141
you might as well
just leave.
Happy to.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.560
I don't want to sit
around and listen
to a bunch of guys

12:06.601 --> 12:08.478
brag about getting a lot.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.522
I'm gonna grab some
Entenmanns and bounce.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.027
Hey.
Hi.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.154
I'm Russell.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.825
Have you made a mess
of your life with sex too?

12:22.867 --> 12:23.910
Yeah, I have.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.372
Well, come on.
Let's start the healing.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.544
Sorry.
Old habit.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.796

though, right?

I hope, Cecily,

12:46.349 --> 12:47.808
I shall not offend you
if I state quite frankly...

12:47.850 --> 12:49.394
Now, this...

12:49.436 --> 12:50.687
This is comedy.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.648

I assure you,

does not blow.

Hey, I'm just gonna
close my eyes, okay?

13:00.863 --> 13:02.907
Just wake me if and
when Ernest goes to camp.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.501
I can't believe
we're actually here.

13:13.543 --> 13:14.711
What's not to believe?

13:14.753 --> 13:16.087
I made a reservation.
Here we are.

13:17.964 --> 13:18.839
Put these on.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.967
In here?

13:21.008 --> 13:23.344
It's what Nicole would do
so as not to be recognized.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.138
(SCOFFS) Fine.

(CLEARS THROAT)

You go to the bar
and have a drink.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.233

will check us in.

13:38.777 --> 13:39.944
(IN GRUFF VOICE)
Okay, mate.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.820
What was that?

13:43.448 --> 13:45.659
Nicole Kidman.
She's Australian.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.243
Sounded more
like a pirate.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.248
Well,
if we're giving each
other performance notes,

13:52.290 --> 13:54.125
I bet Daniel Craig
could suck in his gut

13:54.167 --> 13:55.460
enough to button
his tuxedo pants.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.048
Welcome to Dijon, sir.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.509
Do you have a reservation?

14:02.550 --> 14:05.219
Yes, we spoke
earlier today.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.138
I am with... (WHISPERS)
Miss Nicole Kidman.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.598
Ah, yes.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.433
We'll seat you
right now, sir.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.686
And Miss Kidman is...

14:12.727 --> 14:14.395
At the bar.
She's very private.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.647
Don't look at her.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.985
We always respect
the privacy of our guests.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.530
I expect nothing less from
such a classy establishment.

Oh, crap.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.491

came off my pants.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.245
Okay, I've shared
a lot with you people,

14:31.287 --> 14:33.331
but this one is a doozy.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.543
My darkest hour.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.296
MAY 14th, 2011.

Hey,
that's our wedding day.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.384
That's right.

14:44.425 --> 14:47.595
I felt so horrible
about myself that
I actually married him.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.263
Russell T. Dunbar.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.016
What happened
to "anonymous"?

14:53.434 --> 14:55.436
And, uh,
for the record,

14:55.478 --> 14:57.938
we aren't married anymore,
so I'm good to go.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.566
We all have to hit
our rock bottom, Liz.

15:03.944 --> 15:06.030
I think we all understand
what you're saying.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.073
Would anyone else
like to share?

15:08.241 --> 15:10.493
Let's hear from a lady.

15:10.535 --> 15:11.911
I could really
use some support.

15:11.952 --> 15:12.953
Not you.

15:14.748 --> 15:15.707
You.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.543
And remember,
we're all friends here,

15:18.585 --> 15:20.503
so feel free to be
as filthy as you'd like.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.006
You know, Russell,
instead of deflecting,

15:24.048 --> 15:25.508
why don't you actually
share something?

15:27.218 --> 15:28.344
Oh.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.429
Okay.

15:30.805 --> 15:34.058
Uh, I'm here because
I too carry a heavy burden.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.520
In my pants.
(CHUCKLES)

15:37.562 --> 15:39.146
It's hard to walk.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.023
You're not taking
this seriously.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.234
No, he's not,
and he never will.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.570
Russell, sex will always
control your life.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.113
Yeah, that's the plan.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.658
Look,
we've all been there.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.452
Sex is a tasty temptress,

15:52.493 --> 15:54.245
whether it's on
the floor of a tollbooth

15:54.287 --> 15:55.996
on the Jersey Turnpike

15:56.038 --> 15:58.792
or on a delicious pile
of Arby's roast beef
and cheddars,

15:58.833 --> 16:00.835
but at the end of the day,
nothing changes

16:00.877 --> 16:03.630
unless you are willing
to look yourself
in the mirror and ask,

16:05.298 --> 16:06.883
"Am I truly happy
living this way?"

16:11.596 --> 16:12.722
Wow.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.268
I do make some
pretty shallow choices.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.396
Maybe it's time
for a change.

16:22.565 --> 16:23.357
Or you wanna
get outta here?

16:24.358 --> 16:25.443
Ew, no.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.654
(INHALES)

16:29.363 --> 16:31.115
Ugh, all right.
Come on.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.577
Anne, wait.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.663
You're better than this.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.247
I'm really not.
Atta girl.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.254
I gotta say,
this is a really
great night.

16:45.296 --> 16:46.798
The first of many.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.300
From now on,
you can count on me
to get things done.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.803
Mmm. Thank you.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.221
And I have to admit
I was a little skeptical

16:54.263 --> 16:55.348
about you coming
through this time.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.265
Based on what?

16:57.308 --> 16:58.768
Every other time.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.772
But how 'bout a toast?

17:02.814 --> 17:05.525
To you proving that
you can actually step up

17:05.566 --> 17:06.734
and be a helpful...

17:06.776 --> 17:08.653
Excuse me
for interrupting.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.404
We just wanted
to offer this as a gift,

17:10.446 --> 17:12.156
and say what an honor
it is to have...

17:13.240 --> 17:14.784
You're not Nicole Kidman.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.870
What?

17:16.911 --> 17:18.788
Put these back on.
You weren't supposed
to look at her.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.209
Why would he think
I'm actually Nicole Kidman?

17:23.250 --> 17:25.545
Because I was told
to hold a table
for Nicole Kidman.

17:25.586 --> 17:26.629
You're not
Nicole Kidman.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.341
You never made
the reservation,
did you?

17:30.383 --> 17:33.011
Not in
the traditional sense.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.555
He called this afternoon
and promised Nicole Kidman,

17:35.596 --> 17:36.764
but you're not Nicole...

17:36.806 --> 17:38.683
Yes, I know
I am not Nicole Kidman.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.310
God, this is
so humiliating.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.773
You did say
this was a gift.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.703
(SIGHS)

18:01.372 --> 18:04.166
It's hard for me
to gauge how you're
feeling towards me right now.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.129
'Cause of the separate
cabs and all.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.926
I can't believe
you did that to me.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.385
How embarrassing.

18:15.553 --> 18:16.596
Fun embarrassing?

18:16.637 --> 18:18.932
No!

18:18.973 --> 18:21.141
God, all you had to do
was make one phone call.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.644
I know, I...
What's with me?

18:23.686 --> 18:27.314
Come on, Jeff!
Pull your head
outta your butt!

18:27.356 --> 18:29.776
Do not do that thing
where you pretend
to be mad at yourself

18:29.817 --> 18:31.527
so I can't be mad at you.

18:31.569 --> 18:33.029
You're right.
I do that. Come on!

18:33.071 --> 18:34.447
What am I trying
to pull here?

18:36.198 --> 18:38.076
You know, I...

18:38.117 --> 18:40.411
I just thought
tonight was a sign

18:40.453 --> 18:41.913
that you were
really gonna change.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.790
I did too.
This was expensive.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.417
But if it, you know,

18:47.710 --> 18:49.754
makes any difference,
I really am sorry.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.965
Whatever.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.759
I guess it's just on me
to lower my expectations.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.429
Wait a minute.
What?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.640
What was on this table
this morning?

19:00.681 --> 19:02.976
Two empty beer bottles
and the crumbs
from your hoagie?

19:03.893 --> 19:05.937
What else?

19:05.979 --> 19:09.690
Oh, that envelope
I asked you to mail
for my Lamaze class.

19:09.732 --> 19:12.068
You mailed it?
It's not there, is it?

19:14.278 --> 19:16.489
So that's something,
right?

19:16.530 --> 19:18.365
Big deal, babe.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.576
You stuck a stamp
on an envelope and
dropped it in a mailbox.

19:20.618 --> 19:21.452
It wasn't already stamped?

19:24.538 --> 19:27.000
It doesn't matter,
because when it comes back,

19:27.041 --> 19:29.085
I'll get another shot,
I'm gonna nail it!

19:30.878 --> 19:32.463
Still doesn't make up
for tonight, Jeff.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.507
Wait.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.092
I know what will.

19:38.136 --> 19:39.512
Dinner at 11:30.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.347
Not so bad.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.891
Yeah,
it's very European.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.020
Well, welcome back.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.897
May I start you off
with something to drink?

19:50.690 --> 19:52.191
Uh, no, thanks.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.442
Uh, just a bucket of ice
for this, please.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.331
Oh, Miss Morgan.
Came by for lunch?

20:07.373 --> 20:09.792
No, we are going
pie tasting.
Yup.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.044
Once she gets a taste...

20:11.085 --> 20:12.920
I've had pie before,
Adam.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.841
Oh, anyway,
here's your stupid
Ernest movie.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.218
Thanks.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.637
Though I do wish
we could've found
a comedic common ground.

20:21.679 --> 20:24.140
Yeah. Or at least
something we both
thought was funny.

20:25.808 --> 20:27.810
RUSSELL:
Timmy, I think
there's a bee in here.

20:28.811 --> 20:32.314
This could be
our common ground.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.358
RUSSELL:
Timmy, there is a bee
in here! Timmy!

20:34.400 --> 20:35.651
(SQUEALING)

20:37.653 --> 20:38.946
(LAUGHING)
I can watch this all day.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.614
Oh, let's, then.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.950
(SCREAMS)

20:44.744 --> 20:46.913
Timmy, open up!
Timmy! Timmy!
Aah! Aah!

20:48.288 --> 20:49.456
(CHUCKLES)

20:52.043 --> 20:53.419
He really does
look like Ellen.
Yeah.

20:55.213 --> 20:56.130
(THUD)
Ohh...

20:59.133 --> 21:00.718
Timmy! Anyone?

21:01.468 --> 21:02.970
Adam, help me!

21:04.180 --> 21:05.472
(TINY VOICE)
It's stinging me!
