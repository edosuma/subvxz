00:32.131 --> 00:34.033
Hmm.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.635
You look exactly
like your profile pic.

00:38.671 --> 00:40.372
Thank you.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.674
Even more...
Uh, even prettier.

00:45.845 --> 00:47.780
You actually..

00:47.782 --> 00:50.783
You actually don't look
anything like your profile picture.

00:50.785 --> 00:54.453
Oh, there's a funny story
behind that.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.789
I just got over shingles

00:56.791 --> 00:59.758
and they were like straight
across my face.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.760
<i>So I grew a beard</i>

01:01.762 --> 01:03.228
and I put that one up.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.263
But now it doesn't look like me
'cause in that picture

01:05.266 --> 01:07.499
I had both shingles
and a beard, so..

01:08.668 --> 01:13.238
But I am shingle free,
clean as a whistle.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.743
So, Anne Martin,
what brings you in?

01:17.745 --> 01:20.913
Oh, um, they did,
uh, an STD assembly

01:20.915 --> 01:22.047
at the school where I work

01:22.049 --> 01:24.349
and, uh, it kinda freaked me out

01:24.351 --> 01:28.720
so I just wanted to come in and
make sure everything was okay.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.990
Great. Uh, I just have a
couple of basic questions here.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.826
Uh, do you smoke?

01:33.828 --> 01:35.094
No.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.528
<i>- Do drugs?
- No.</i>

01:36.530 --> 01:38.063
Drink alcohol?

01:38.065 --> 01:39.731
A little chardonnay occasionally

01:39.733 --> 01:42.534
but, um, not really, no.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.404
Have you traveled out of the
country in the last 6 months?

01:45.406 --> 01:46.605
No.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.773
<i>Have you had intercourse</i>

01:47.775 --> 01:50.375
<i>with anyone from
a foreign country?</i>

01:50.377 --> 01:52.344
- No.
- Okay.

01:52.346 --> 01:55.013
Have you had anal intercourse?
No. I mean..

01:56.649 --> 01:58.784
I don't.. I don't
wanna sound judgy.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.687
<i>Uh, i... it's not
for everyone.</i>

02:01.689 --> 02:04.723
It could be for me maybe under
the right circumstances.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.391
I have to be very relaxed.

02:06.393 --> 02:08.060
<i>But, um..</i>

02:08.062 --> 02:10.027
But I'm not like in a..

02:10.030 --> 02:11.730
An anal place.

02:11.732 --> 02:14.233
- Okay.
<i>- N... no.</i>

02:15.268 --> 02:16.668
I believe you
had the salad, sir.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.703
Yes.

02:25.044 --> 02:27.880
That's a lot of onions.

02:27.882 --> 02:30.382
Yeah. I like onions.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.619
Make you cry.

02:34.954 --> 02:38.557
Yeah, you know,
uh, actually, uh..

02:38.559 --> 02:40.058
My eyes were bigger
than my stomach.

02:40.060 --> 02:43.462
I just.. Suddenly not really
hungry at all.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.731
<i>And I realize...</i>

02:45.733 --> 02:48.867
<i>I have a very
early morning tomorrow.</i>

02:48.869 --> 02:50.903
You can go if you want.

02:51.871 --> 02:53.572
You can just box it up.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.607
- No.
<i>- I know what it means.</i>

02:57.010 --> 02:58.777
<i>Can you be honest with me?</i>

02:58.779 --> 03:00.879
What is it about
me that is like..

03:00.881 --> 03:03.515
That you.. M... m... makes you
<i>not wanna sit here?</i>

03:04.817 --> 03:06.618
- Honestly?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

03:08.989 --> 03:10.956
It's like everything

03:10.958 --> 03:12.558
starting with your face first.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.294
Just like the expression
on it is really bad.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.129
<i>You sort of look like</i>

03:17.131 --> 03:19.531
<i>you're smelling something
that doesn't smell good</i>

03:19.533 --> 03:21.300
or like, you're like squinting

03:21.302 --> 03:22.467
even though
you're wearing glasses

03:22.469 --> 03:23.769
like, your eyes don't work.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.504
<i>You kinda look like</i>

03:25.506 --> 03:29.141
<i>a lesbian newscaster
'cause you're effeminate</i>

03:29.143 --> 03:30.175
but not in like a good way.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.077
It's almost insulting to women.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.212
The way you're effeminate.

03:33.214 --> 03:34.479
'Cause like you're
not androgynous.

03:34.481 --> 03:37.649
You're just
like soft and doughy.

03:37.651 --> 03:40.686
You don't look like you have
bones under your body at all.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.889
You're just sort of
like an old baby, you know?

03:43.891 --> 03:46.592
<i>You just seem very
uncomfortable.</i>

03:46.594 --> 03:49.261
You know, like a little bit

03:49.263 --> 03:52.531
like you're apologizing
for your existence.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.565
Just..

03:58.438 --> 04:00.372
That's a complete answer.

04:02.208 --> 04:05.077
When was the last time
you engaged in intercourse?

04:05.079 --> 04:06.245
Um..

04:07.347 --> 04:09.248
Do you mean like, um,

04:09.250 --> 04:12.150
full on kind of inter..

04:12.152 --> 04:14.086
I would say about..

04:15.655 --> 04:17.456
About comin' up on a year.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.759
A little over a year. It's like
a shade over a year.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.928
- So you're abstinent.
- No. Mm-hmm.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.197
No, not abstinent.
I'm just, um..

04:25.199 --> 04:27.065
It's not like a spiritual

04:27.067 --> 04:29.935
kind of cleansing thing
which is abstinence.

04:29.937 --> 04:34.039
It's more just like, Oh gosh,
it has.. Is it March already?

04:34.041 --> 04:35.440
So..

04:53.159 --> 04:54.593
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

04:55.663 --> 04:57.829
Oh, my God! Are you choking?

04:59.766 --> 05:01.867
Oh, my God!

05:01.869 --> 05:03.702
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, my God!

05:03.704 --> 05:05.370
- Ah!
- Oh, my God!

05:06.105 --> 05:07.539
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

05:07.541 --> 05:10.909
Come on! Spit it out!
Spit it out! Spit it out!

05:12.345 --> 05:13.512
Ah!

05:18.284 --> 05:19.918
<i>Are you alright?</i>

05:35.702 --> 05:36.902
How do you wanna
handle the check?

05:36.904 --> 05:39.471
You wanna split it or..

05:59.959 --> 06:02.294
- I don't wanna go.
- Oh, you don't wanna go, huh?

06:02.296 --> 06:05.430
- No.
- No? You wanna stay?

06:05.432 --> 06:07.866
Oh, hey, you know what?
Jeff here'll walk you out.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.701
Oh, yeah,
I could walk you out.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.737
I just have a very specific

06:11.739 --> 06:14.406
window of time when my, um..

06:14.408 --> 06:16.475
...commute is easier than..

06:19.145 --> 06:22.147
Okay. So you're good
and I'm good, so..

06:23.015 --> 06:26.918
♪ Hallelujah

06:26.920 --> 06:30.355
♪ Know who you are
forget what you're not ♪

06:31.257 --> 06:33.558

Kurt Vonnegut.
It's "Cat's Cradle."

06:41.802 --> 06:43.435
Yeah, I was right there.
Tip of my tongue.

06:43.437 --> 06:46.605
You're so slow!
So, how was your date?

06:46.607 --> 06:47.873
Oh, not great.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.609
I choked on a piece
of soft food out of nerves.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.943
How was the doctor?

06:51.945 --> 06:55.947
Oh, um, apparently
I'm clinically abstinent.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.482
- Clinically abstinent?
- Yeah.

06:57.484 --> 06:59.117
It's a thing and I've got it.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.119
I've never heard anybody
diagnosed with that.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.354
Hi.

07:02.356 --> 07:07.092
Um, speaking of, have you
talked to Max about me?

07:07.094 --> 07:10.495
Max? Yeah. You went on one
date with him 3 months ago.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.731
I would let it go, you know?
No, it was a great date.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.199
I mean, actually
I'm not counting but

07:14.201 --> 07:16.501
it was technically
two and a half months ago.

07:16.503 --> 07:18.570
If you're using the term
technically then you're counting.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.138
Oh. Well, technically
it's not counting, I'm just...

07:20.140 --> 07:21.673
Mr. Lowry, Mr. Lowry.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.176
Please thank your mother
for running the bake sale.

07:24.178 --> 07:25.677
I've never known the parent

07:25.679 --> 07:28.146
of a faculty member
to be so involved at school.

07:28.148 --> 07:31.216
Oh, Anne, my tits
are leaking like a motherfuck..

07:31.218 --> 07:33.351
Principal Miller.

07:33.353 --> 07:35.921
Language, Julia.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.523
I'm so sorry about that.
Last day of school.

07:40.059 --> 07:42.394
And your shirt sleeves
are a little short.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.329
Yeah, I... I actually
think so too.

07:44.331 --> 07:46.331
I'm gonna go put on a cardigan.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.301
<i>- Now.
- You're a gorgeous woman.</i>

07:49.303 --> 07:51.536
Cardigan now.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.171
- Don't run!
<i>- Sorry.</i>

07:53.173 --> 07:56.308
- But hurry.
- It's the last day of school.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.310
Everyone's letting
their hair down, you know.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.178
- Not on my watch.
- Oh!

08:01.280 --> 08:03.448
Okay. I don't know
what that means

08:03.450 --> 08:05.650
I just clam up
whenever she comes around.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.185
Yeah.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.820
Well, maybe we'll have,
you know, some luck

08:08.822 --> 08:10.589
at the end of year
party tonight.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.723
You mean like more luck than

08:11.725 --> 08:13.892
the year that you
clogged up the toilet?

08:13.894 --> 08:15.827
Actually that was
the year before.

08:15.829 --> 08:16.962
Oh, then more
luck than the year

08:16.964 --> 08:18.697
you walked through
a screen door?

08:18.699 --> 08:21.132
Okay, but in my defense

08:21.134 --> 08:22.968
they should just put a ribbon
across those things

08:22.970 --> 08:24.402
'cause you can't
always see them.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.271
Yo... you're right, they
should sell every screen door

08:26.273 --> 08:29.207
with a big ribbon on it.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.342
I'm just putting it out there.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.776
Maybe we'll have
more luck this year

08:31.778 --> 08:33.712
because they'll
be all that faculty

08:33.714 --> 08:36.280
from Ben Franklin High so
they'll be more people to meet.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.850
Yeah! Maybe they'll
get a kick out of my foibles.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.352
Maybe you don't
use the word foibles.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.852
Oh.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.756
Duly noted, sir.
<i>That's not great either.</i>

08:44.758 --> 08:45.824
Oh, boy.

08:49.228 --> 08:50.629
Maybe you should be paying

08:50.631 --> 08:53.031
a little more attention
to your studies

08:53.033 --> 08:57.636
and less attention to "How much
sex your peers are having."

08:57.638 --> 08:59.538
How else am I gonna know?

08:59.540 --> 09:01.206
Get out of here.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.042
Enjoy your last moments
here being educated.

09:13.853 --> 09:17.122
"How old were you when
you lost your virginity?"

09:18.324 --> 09:19.357
20.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.162
That's not an option.

09:39.145 --> 09:42.847
Yeah, so we were just there
and like.. No, he left.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.916
<i>And I was like,
where'd you go?</i>

09:44.918 --> 09:46.751
<i>What?</i>

09:46.753 --> 09:48.753
I swear to God,
he's such a dickface!

09:48.755 --> 09:51.389
Okay, I know
you don't have any work to do

09:51.391 --> 09:53.358
but, guys, it's still
called study hall.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.427
I have to go.
I'll call you later.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.462
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:59.766 --> 10:02.200
Okay, everybody,
have a great summer.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.335
Don't forget to read.

10:03.337 --> 10:04.669
Woo-hoo!

10:04.671 --> 10:05.704
Mm-hmm.

10:07.239 --> 10:08.406
Slut.

10:19.218 --> 10:21.119
Hey, I got this..

10:23.990 --> 10:25.490
Hi, guys, be careful.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.562
Oh, that doesn't..

10:32.264 --> 10:34.499
Hey, guys, cool,
cool to see you.

10:36.736 --> 10:38.303
Good. Good, good.

10:39.405 --> 10:40.839
Nice cabinet. Um..

10:46.779 --> 10:50.749
- This your house?
- Oh, no. It's just..

10:50.751 --> 10:54.052
Just cleaning up,
making myself useful.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.854
Do you wanna help?
Sure.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.956
Cool. Thanks so much.

11:03.195 --> 11:05.463
That guy was hot.
What was that all about?

11:05.465 --> 11:08.767
Oh, he's really cute.
Then he gave me his garbage.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.102
Put that garbage down. Stop.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.371
The beauty of coming to someone
else's house or party

11:13.373 --> 11:15.240
is that you
can just make a mess

11:15.242 --> 11:18.076
you don't have
to clean up after anybody.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.111
How do you do it?
You're so put together.

11:20.113 --> 11:23.415
I mean, you just
got like Al, the baby..

11:23.417 --> 11:25.950
I am not put together

11:25.952 --> 11:28.586
but I do have a little..
I guess, I don't know.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.889
I don't know if it's a secret,
but something I do.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.792
Please, uh, tell me. I'm
swinging in the wind here.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.127
Are you familiar with Kegeling?

11:36.129 --> 11:40.198
Yeah, that's the, um,
squeezing the vaginal wall.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.501
Makes me feel confident,
powerful, but kind of at ease.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.669
You know what I'm saying?

11:44.671 --> 11:47.072
It's like a glass of wine
for the prives.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.841
Ooh, I like that.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.345
Wha.. What are you
doing with your face?

11:54.347 --> 11:55.647
<i>Relax your jaw.</i>

11:55.649 --> 11:58.750
Don't over think it.
Just do it. Just squeeze.

11:59.752 --> 12:00.819
<i>Now you look like a zombie.</i>

12:00.821 --> 12:03.021
You're not blinking
whatsoever now.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.923
- That seems like it's easier.
- No.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.558
- Hey, honey, um, sorry.
- Hey.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.326
- Hey, Al.
<i>- I just spoke with the sitter</i>

12:08.328 --> 12:10.228
and apparently the baby's
getting very fussy.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.397
- Oh, no!
- Yeah, sorry. I think we have to go.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.965
Alright, will you pull the
car around? I'll be right out.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.034
I will indeed.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.235
Are you okay with me going?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.104
Yeah, go get your damn baby.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.905
I'm just kidding. I love her.
She's so sweet.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.373
I love you.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.342
- Happy summer.
- Happy summer. Enjoy.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.144
- Yeah, I will now.
- And get out there.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.213
Yeah, I will.
I'm just gonna..

12:30.883 --> 12:33.284
Hey, Carol,
what a terrific school year.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.819
Can I make you a snack plate?

12:34.821 --> 12:37.789
I'm not eating. I'm only
drinking clear liquids now.

12:37.791 --> 12:38.791
So, no.

12:42.161 --> 12:45.897
- Yeah, Carol is so irritable.
- She's a real hothead.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.832
She must be hungry
all the time.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.335
That's my problem,
you know. I'm a nice guy.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.070
I'm almost too nice.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.372
I ask people if they
want a snack plate.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.408
I go to work every day.
I pay my taxes.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.843
And what's my reward?

12:58.845 --> 13:00.812
Maybe it's not
about your rewards.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.313
Maybe it's more about just like

13:02.315 --> 13:04.315
being comfortable
in your own skin.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.186
"Be yourself. Everybody else
is already taken."

13:08.188 --> 13:09.754
Oh, um..

13:09.756 --> 13:11.322
- It's Oscar Wilde.
- Yes!

13:11.324 --> 13:12.991
God, you're so quick. You don't
give me enough time.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.025
Because you're so slow.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.059
You have a quick
trigger finger.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.060
Yeah, I do.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.065
I gotta pee. Get in the mix.

13:29.241 --> 13:31.342
- That's a nice shirt.
- Thank you.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.345
Or is it a blouse?
How can you tell?

13:36.349 --> 13:37.849
Where are you?

13:38.951 --> 13:40.685
No. Nobody good here.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.121
I heard that.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.494
I.. I have my own thing
to take care of.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.528
What?

13:51.630 --> 13:53.270
<i>- Anne.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

13:56.669 --> 13:58.703
You think your dad got lost
looking for the tables?

13:58.705 --> 14:01.439
<i>- I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.
- Oh, uh, uh, there it is.</i>

14:01.441 --> 14:02.874
Perfect. Yeah,
put it right there.

14:02.876 --> 14:06.311
How many guests
are we expecting? One?

14:06.313 --> 14:07.745
- Well..
- That's only the first of many.

14:07.747 --> 14:08.880
Don't you think we're planning

14:08.882 --> 14:10.782
a little early for
this birthday party?

14:10.784 --> 14:13.084
<i>I mean, you don't
turn 65 for two months.</i>

14:13.086 --> 14:15.453
There is nothing wrong
with planning early.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.722
Besides it... it
allows people to

14:17.724 --> 14:20.525
you know,
mark their calendars and..

14:20.527 --> 14:23.294
<i>...maybe even bring a date.</i>

14:23.296 --> 14:26.965
Yeah, are you, uh,
planning on bringin' a date?

14:26.967 --> 14:30.869
- I sure am not, dad.
- Okay, just asking.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.670
What about that Anne?

14:32.672 --> 14:35.206
- Wow, she's... super.
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

14:35.208 --> 14:36.641
Please, it's weird to hear you

14:36.643 --> 14:38.576
breathe deep like
that and talk about her.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.044
I just said she's super.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.313
I'm gonna put her on the list.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.848
Did you ever ask her out?

14:43.850 --> 14:47.452
No, I have never asked her
out because we're good friends.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.987
I don't want
anything to ruin that

14:48.989 --> 14:51.422
<i>and she does not
see me like that, so..</i>

14:52.658 --> 14:54.459
She's into my neighbor.

14:58.597 --> 15:00.465
Do you know any gay couples?

15:02.134 --> 15:05.703
I mean, I... I know a couple
gay couples. Why?

15:06.839 --> 15:08.940
Well, we could
add them to the list.

15:08.942 --> 15:12.277
And you could maybe bring
a special person too.

15:14.013 --> 15:15.413
I'm sorry.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.652
Are you implying that I am gay?

15:20.654 --> 15:22.687
If you have trouble
coming out..

15:23.956 --> 15:26.090
...let us come in.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.592
Why? I don't wanna go in.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.228
Wait, I.. I am sorry, I'm
still having trouble

15:30.230 --> 15:32.030
with the math of this. Why..

15:32.032 --> 15:33.932
Even if I was gay

15:33.934 --> 15:36.267
why would I invite
a gay couple?

15:36.269 --> 15:39.404
- To feel more comfortable.
- They're.. They're already a couple.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.975
Balloons.

15:43.977 --> 15:47.011
Oh, or are they
a little too young?

15:47.013 --> 15:48.046
Why don't we get
a bouncy castle?

15:48.048 --> 15:49.747
<i>No, balloons it is.</i>

15:49.749 --> 15:51.349
- Thank you.
- And Jeffrey, you're in charge of the balloons.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.685
Okay. I'll get those
balloons in 2 months.

15:53.687 --> 15:56.254
In a quarter of a year.
Before 2 months.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.022
It's gonna sneak up on you
all of a sudden, you're gonna...

15:58.024 --> 15:59.524
And then you're gonna
have flat balloons.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.026
- You still have to get...
- You can't get balloons early.

16:02.028 --> 16:04.762
Just line them up,
know where you're gonna get them and...

16:04.764 --> 16:06.297
Line them up and know where
I'm gonna get them?

16:06.299 --> 16:07.665
I'm not invading Pakistan.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.400
Darren, Darren, he's gonna
take care of them

16:09.402 --> 16:11.369
right, sweetheart?
Yes, I'll take care of them.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.206
<i>- Listen to me.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

16:15.208 --> 16:17.709
I'm just gonna show up and..

16:17.711 --> 16:19.978
...bump into Max after book club like
I did when we met.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.413
<i>Anne, don't you think that's
gonna come off a little creepy?</i>

16:22.415 --> 16:24.782
No, I think it's romantic.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.484
<i>Okay, someone's gotta say it.</i>

16:26.486 --> 16:28.152
<i>If he was feeling
the Anne train</i>

16:28.154 --> 16:30.021
<i>don't you think he would
have hopped aboard by now?</i>

16:30.023 --> 16:32.290
Well, maybe he's
playing hard to get.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.158
I mean, I don't know I can't be

16:34.160 --> 16:36.260
the only person
who feels this way.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.529
<i>- Anne.
- Okay, more importantly.</i>

16:38.531 --> 16:40.264
What am I wearing?
<i>Hmm.</i>

16:40.266 --> 16:41.799
<i>Something slimming,
maybe black.</i>

16:41.801 --> 16:44.335
<i>Whatever you choose, just not
the fucking cat sweater.</i>

16:49.242 --> 16:51.075
First of all, it's summer.

16:51.077 --> 16:53.411
And second of all
I don't even..

16:53.413 --> 16:56.047
I don't.. I don't really have
that sweater anymore.

16:59.451 --> 17:02.253
<i>Okay, everybody,
I wanna thank you guys</i>

17:02.255 --> 17:05.056
for coming to book club.

17:05.058 --> 17:08.259
We are in session. Dan, you
picked the book for this week.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.695
- "Of Mice and Men."
- Oh, come on, Dan!

17:11.698 --> 17:13.064
He's doing this
on purpose, guys.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.665
<i>- I love this book.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

17:14.666 --> 17:16.467
You've read it like
a thousand times!

17:16.469 --> 17:18.169
Yeah, more than that.
It's great.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.771
He's just doing
this to piss me off, guys.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.638
- Not true.
- It is true!

17:21.641 --> 17:24.175
'Cause my name's Lenny
and my entire life

17:24.176 --> 17:26.144
whenever I tell someone
that my name is Lenny

17:26.146 --> 17:27.345
they ask me if I'm retarded.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.679
Come on, man, that..

17:28.681 --> 17:30.615
A... a lot of people
have the name Lenny.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.050
Oh, now that you mention it

17:32.052 --> 17:34.652
I... I.. I'm actually picturing
you as Lenny in the book.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.789
And it's making it a lot more
accessible for me.

17:37.791 --> 17:40.258
Wha... what's the connection
to the book?

17:40.260 --> 17:42.126
- He's a retarded guy...
- ...that kills other guys.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.996
<i>Don't spoil the whole book for him.
He didn't read it yet.</i>

17:44.998 --> 17:46.898
My entire life
I have had to deal with it.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.533
I just tell somebody,
I go hi, I'm Lenny.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.334
And they're like,
oh, this guy's retarded.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.904
Well, maybe it's the... the
cadence with which you say it.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.239
What the cadence of how
I'm saying hi, I'm Lenny.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.641
That's..
There's nothing.. What?

17:56.643 --> 17:58.476
Yeah, why... why you doing
it like that?

17:58.478 --> 18:00.311
Yeah, it sounds bad.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.680
I mean, you're wearing socks
with sandals.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.916
Yeah, 'cause I'm not retarded.

18:08.187 --> 18:11.589
I wear sandals because
my feet sweat.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.492
And I wear the socks
to catch that sweat.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.627
So the socks help the sandal

18:16.629 --> 18:19.363
and the sandal help the sock.

18:19.365 --> 18:20.665
Not retarded.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.067
You feel like a jerk.

18:23.069 --> 18:26.838
Alright, guys, are... are we
gonna get into the book or not?

18:26.840 --> 18:29.874
'Cause, I mean, I could always
go downtown and have a drink.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.876
- On Sunday?
- It's Sunday night.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.145
Yeah, people go
out on Sunday, guys.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.913
Girls go out on Sundays.

18:35.915 --> 18:38.082
Yeah, crazy people
are out on Sundays.

18:38.084 --> 18:39.884
It would be nice to meet
some girls though

18:39.886 --> 18:41.319
I mean..
Yeah.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.354
I know you guys haven't had
dates in a long time.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.022
- That's not true.
- Yeah, that's not true.

18:45.024 --> 18:47.625
Well, I have a girlfriend.
I... I don't have a girlfriend.

18:49.428 --> 18:50.795
You just started
that sentence by saying

18:50.797 --> 18:51.963
I have a girlfriend.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.531
<i>- Yeah.
- Why would you do that?</i>

18:53.533 --> 18:55.266
Uh, It's..
I just wanted to hear

18:55.268 --> 18:58.469
what it would sound
like coming out of my mouth.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.838
It's such an inappropriate
time to experiment with that.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.640
I'm just glad because
it sounded like

19:02.642 --> 19:04.442
he had murdered a girl.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.277
- What happened to her?
- She was here.

19:06.279 --> 19:07.612
Now she's not with us anymore.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.515
Okay, the term not with us
anymore implies death.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.817
<i>It's almost like
you admitted to</i>

19:12.819 --> 19:14.752
murdering or killing a woman.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.454
<i>- What are you talking.. No.
- And then you cannot be sure about it.</i>

19:16.456 --> 19:18.356
<i>Okay, well, then why aren't
you dating her anymore?</i>

19:18.358 --> 19:21.425
Because I just.. I buried
her in the past, you know.

19:21.427 --> 19:23.427
- So wait, wait..
- So that means you do have a girlfriend.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.563
Did you murder a girl?

19:25.565 --> 19:27.198
Or did you like bury her
somewhere and...

19:27.200 --> 19:28.332
- Guys, this..
- Do you don't know if she's passed yet?

19:28.334 --> 19:29.834
This is
an inappropriate conversation.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.970
I gotta tell you
that if a police questioned me

19:32.972 --> 19:35.907
and said, did you notice
anything weird about Dan lately?

19:35.909 --> 19:38.509
This would be the first
conversation that I would bring up.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.977
- I'm just saying I don't...
- Just tell us there's no girl...

19:39.979 --> 19:41.279
I never had a girlfriend.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.681
- Alright.
- Okay.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.083
- Thank God.
- I go.. I go on dates all the time.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.518
No, you don't.
Come on, Lenny.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.153
When was the last time
you were out on a date?

19:49.155 --> 19:50.588
- What day is today?
<i>- Sunday.</i>

19:50.590 --> 19:52.323
1986.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.125
Guys, I think we need to..

19:55.194 --> 19:56.861
...change what's goin'
on with us.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.130
We're 30-year-old guys.
We have a book club.

19:59.132 --> 20:02.934
I wear khaki every day.

20:02.936 --> 20:06.771
I mean, I haven't been on a
successful date in a long time.

20:06.773 --> 20:09.407
We need to live cool.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.676
You know, we need to like
be on the edge of the...

20:11.678 --> 20:13.044
What does that mean?

20:13.046 --> 20:14.345
It's like the bracelets.
Live Cool bracelets.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.846
Yeah, it's like
a Live Cool bracelets.

20:15.848 --> 20:19.650
- Live Strong.
- Guys, guys, guys, guys.

20:19.652 --> 20:23.020
You don't have to change
anything about yourselves to be cool, okay?

20:23.022 --> 20:26.324
You just have to be cool.

20:29.795 --> 20:31.128
- Well..
- That was awesome.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.097
Yeah. I'm gonna write
that down.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.132
- Wow, thanks, man.
- Sure.

20:36.301 --> 20:37.768
Alright, look, guys, I'm gonna
get out of here.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.470
I'm gonna get a drink.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.838
We'll do this
next week though, yeah?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.340
<i>- Yeah. Deal.
- Alright.</i>

20:42.342 --> 20:44.108
But, uh, Jeff, you know what?

20:45.611 --> 20:47.445
Why don't you take this, okay?

20:47.447 --> 20:50.982
Whoa. You want me to have
your summertime leather jacket?

20:50.984 --> 20:52.516
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:52.518 --> 20:55.553
Who knows, maybe
it'll help you on your journey.

20:57.156 --> 20:59.657
Then again, it might also hurt.

20:59.659 --> 21:02.560
But isn't
that everything in life?

21:02.562 --> 21:04.495
- Wow.
- That was cool too. Write that down too.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.797
- How do you do that?
- Get that one on there too.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.439
Oh, my God.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.376
Oh, the book club. Oh, yeah,
I forgot. I was just..

21:18.378 --> 21:20.945
I was just walking around.
I was running. I was at yoga.

21:20.947 --> 21:24.649
I'm just doing Pilates
and I had my books and I was on..

21:24.651 --> 21:27.291
- It's so good to see you though
- Anne.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.456
- It's Max.
- Yeah.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.725
Max! I thoug..

21:36.128 --> 21:38.095
You're not,
in the book club.

21:38.097 --> 21:40.398
Oh, yeah, I... I skipped
out a little early.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.766
Grab a drink and a sandwich.

21:41.768 --> 21:44.035
- Oh, a drink and a sandwich.
- Yeah.

21:46.204 --> 21:48.439
It's so good to see you.
I said sandwich.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.175
Um, it's.. Come inside?

22:00.218 --> 22:02.153
Mm.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.421
It's good.
Yeah.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.922
Mm-hmm. I like beer.

22:07.292 --> 22:10.561
Um, my watch broke, how long..
How long has it been?

22:10.563 --> 22:13.331
- What?
<i>- When we saw each other?</i>

22:13.333 --> 22:14.365
Oh!

22:15.267 --> 22:16.734
God, I..

22:16.736 --> 22:19.970
I literally have
no recollection of it.

22:19.972 --> 22:22.940
Me neither. It was like
3 months ago and..

22:22.942 --> 22:24.809
I don't know.
Okay.

22:26.211 --> 22:28.279
It was a.. Um..

22:28.281 --> 22:29.714
That guy. I was looking at him.

22:29.716 --> 22:33.384
- Oh! Yeah, I painted that.
<i>- You did?</i>

22:33.386 --> 22:37.421
- Yeah, it's, uh, it's gouache.
- Squash?

22:37.423 --> 22:39.023
It starts with a G. Gouache.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.492
- It's gouache.
- Yeah, it's... it's the kind of paint.

22:41.494 --> 22:44.128
- Mm.
- It's, uh, it's fickle.

22:44.130 --> 22:47.465
<i>- Yeah.
- Paint that's got this really wonderful texture.</i>

22:47.467 --> 22:49.467
It's kind of like a..

22:49.469 --> 22:52.236
It's like a woman.
You gotta sorta..

22:52.238 --> 22:54.972
<i>You gotta warm it up
a little bit and sorta..</i>

22:54.974 --> 22:57.875
You know, show it that you're
ready to play before you..

22:57.877 --> 23:00.478
...spread it around
a little bit.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.279
It's dirty.
It must be dirty.

23:02.281 --> 23:03.581
<i>Yeah, it get's a little messy.</i>

23:03.583 --> 23:05.349
<i>That's, uh, that's part
of the fun, right?</i>

23:05.351 --> 23:07.718
Oh, yes. Yeah,
I like to get messy.

23:10.455 --> 23:14.558
Yeah, oh.
<i>Hello? Oh, my God.</i>

23:14.560 --> 23:15.760
Oh, my God.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.329
What the hell
are you doing here?

23:18.331 --> 23:20.898
I thought I took back my key.
Yeah, you did.

23:20.900 --> 23:25.002
But I made a copy first
from the key copier.

23:25.004 --> 23:28.372
- That is so like you. Get out.
- No.

23:28.374 --> 23:29.807
<i>What do you want?</i>

23:29.809 --> 23:31.242
What do you think?

23:31.244 --> 23:33.844
I want my apology.
Oh, for what?

23:33.846 --> 23:37.248
- Boo-whoo, ooh-ooh are you fucking kidding me?
<i>- Alright, look, look..</i>

23:37.250 --> 23:40.651
I know that I can be a dick
sometimes, alright? I don't mean it.

23:40.653 --> 23:44.221
That.. Oh, is that.. Is tha.. was that..
Was that your.. Was that his apology?

23:44.223 --> 23:46.824
'Cause it didn't sound like one.
No, it didn't. What was that?

23:46.826 --> 23:50.261
- Give me that key.
- Come and get 'em.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.665
- You know.. You know I won't go down there.
- Whoo. What are you gonna do?

23:54.667 --> 23:55.933
What are you gonna do when
you're there?

23:55.935 --> 23:56.967
What are you gonna do when
you're down there?

23:56.969 --> 23:58.002
<i>You gonna sniff around,</i>

23:58.004 --> 23:59.036
<i>'cause you're a little dog.</i>

23:59.038 --> 24:00.070
Slow it down.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.173
You're gonna go sniff around

24:02.175 --> 24:04.608
'cause you're a fucking dog.
Oh, God!

24:06.545 --> 24:08.012
Yeah, you remember?
Oh, yeah.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.413
- You remember Amber?
- I remember you.

24:09.415 --> 24:11.782
- You remember Amber?
- You know I'm better..

24:11.784 --> 24:14.819
- Mm, hmm..
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

24:14.821 --> 24:16.987
Oh, God, you smell
so fucking good.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.523
You smell like shit.
Such, such shit.

24:19.525 --> 24:20.958
You don't get to look
me in the ass.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.126
I won't look. I won't look.
I won't look.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.628
Okay, I got all my books, so..

24:25.397 --> 24:26.931
Hi, I'm A... Anne.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.933
Anne?

24:28.935 --> 24:31.268
<i>- You don't deserve it!
- I don't deserve it!</i>

24:31.270 --> 24:33.470
<i>- You don't deserve it!
- I don't deserve it!</i>

24:33.705 --> 24:34.972
And now you remember, right?

24:34.974 --> 24:36.173
<i>- Beg for it.
- I want your..</i>

24:36.175 --> 24:37.374
<i>- Beg for it.

24:37.376 --> 24:39.136
<i>- Beg for it.
- Please!</i>

24:46.719 --> 24:50.120
Jeff, what do you see
when you look at me?

24:50.122 --> 24:52.490
- Like right now?
- Yeah, like this.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.393
I think you look like

24:56.395 --> 24:58.762
you work at a cellphone
kiosk in the mall.

25:00.131 --> 25:03.868
I dressed like this
to seduce Max. Okay.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.603
This was your seductive look?

25:05.605 --> 25:08.272
I was going for like
sexy librarian or like..

25:08.274 --> 25:10.875
...Euro kind of just..

25:10.877 --> 25:12.743
You know, like what is this?

25:12.745 --> 25:14.845
You kind of look like my
mom's financial advisor.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.213
Yeah.

25:16.215 --> 25:19.650
I just feel like I'm tired
of being such a dork.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.619
Yes, yeah, I wanna be
one of those guys

25:21.621 --> 25:23.087
that like starts dating a girl

25:23.089 --> 25:24.755
and then the girl's parents
get all freaked out

25:24.757 --> 25:26.457
because they think the guy's
gonna steal her TV

25:26.459 --> 25:27.725
and sell it for drug money.

25:27.727 --> 25:31.195
I wanna be like, you know,
one of those girls

25:31.197 --> 25:33.430
whose parents don't want her
to come home for Christmas.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.766
I wanna be a guy that no
matter where they are

25:35.768 --> 25:37.201
there's a possibility that he..

25:37.203 --> 25:38.636
He could have sex in a bathroom.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.204
I wanna be sex in
the bathroom people.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.172
That's so cool.
I wanna get arrested..

25:42.174 --> 25:43.207
...for having sex
in a bathroom.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.808
I wanna be on "Cops."

25:46.244 --> 25:48.445
How do we do this?
How is this done?

25:48.447 --> 25:49.813
I don't know.
How is this done?

25:49.815 --> 25:51.315
I don't know.
Play to our strengths?

25:51.317 --> 25:53.250
Play to our strengths.

25:53.252 --> 25:56.620
Okay, well, my biggest strength
is helping kids apply to colleges.

25:56.622 --> 25:59.623
And I'm... I'm really good
at research.

25:59.625 --> 26:03.761
So, we're screwed.
We need help.

26:13.238 --> 26:16.140
- Al gets into such cool parties.
- I know, right?

26:16.142 --> 26:18.008
- Yeah.
- Oh, you gotta meet this guy.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.910
Hey, so you Julia, right?
Al's wife.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.078
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.346
And you should
meet my friend Anne.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.982
<i>Enchante,</i> I'm Anne.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.817
<i>Big fan. Oh, sorry.</i>

26:26.819 --> 26:28.552
I should tone it down.
I'm fanning out on you.

26:28.554 --> 26:30.187
<i>I was actually hoping maybe
to get an album tonight.</i>

26:30.189 --> 26:32.389
Are you selling merchandise or..

26:32.391 --> 26:34.558
Hi. How you doing?
Come with me, buddy.

26:34.560 --> 26:37.094
- Hi, Al.
- Ladies.

26:37.096 --> 26:40.256
- I really came on strong.
- A little bit. It's okay. It's okay.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.570
Mm. Before I forget to
say this, you look beautiful tonight.

26:46.572 --> 26:47.938
Whatever, bitch!

26:49.040 --> 26:50.541
Um, what was that?

26:50.543 --> 26:52.910
I don't know, I'm just..
I'm trying this new thing.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.779
And, um, I just
wanna go crazy.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.481
<i>You know, I wanna go wild.</i>

26:57.483 --> 26:59.350
- What were you doing talkin' to that man?
- Yeah.

26:59.352 --> 27:01.819
Oh. The guy in the hat?

27:01.821 --> 27:03.621
Oh, that was your
boyfriend? Oh.

27:03.623 --> 27:05.589
We're having a little
disagreement about that right now.

27:05.591 --> 27:08.125
Oh, no, no, no. I was..
I was.. I was just saying hi.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.493
<i>His music is wonderful.</i>

27:09.495 --> 27:11.562
Oh, okay, that's cool.
That's cool.

27:11.564 --> 27:14.665
I'm sorry, girl.
You know how it is, you know.

27:14.667 --> 27:17.201
When you love
a man so much, you know

27:17.203 --> 27:19.837
that you end up
in jail for your love.

27:19.839 --> 27:23.040
You know what I mean? Then you get out and
you see some girl like talking to him.

27:23.042 --> 27:25.209
And you want to like stab her.
Yeah.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.177
- But you can't.
- Sounds complicated.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.746
Anyway, have a..
Have a lovely day.

27:28.748 --> 27:31.715
We're just discussing some
stuff about my friend here.

27:31.717 --> 27:33.517
You wanna go crazy,
I heard though.

27:33.519 --> 27:35.953
I do. I just.. look at me.

27:35.955 --> 27:37.187
I'm dressed like a band leader.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.323
<i>I feel like I need
a little something.</i>

27:39.325 --> 27:40.591
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I hear you.

27:40.593 --> 27:42.493
- Spice it up.
- All that needs to.. Yeah.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.228
You need to just make it more.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.796
<i>Let me tell you somethin', girl.</i>

27:45.798 --> 27:47.698
If you wanna keep your man

27:47.700 --> 27:49.967
you've got to follow some very
simple instructions, alright?

27:49.969 --> 27:52.002
- They're very simple.
- Follow them to a T.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.404
Number one

27:53.406 --> 27:55.973
If he doesn't pick up his phone
when you're calling him

27:55.975 --> 27:58.642
you just keep calling.

27:58.644 --> 28:00.144
And if he doesn't answer
what do you do?

28:00.146 --> 28:02.479
- Stop calling.
- You hunt him down.

28:02.481 --> 28:03.681
- Yeah.
- Okay?

28:03.683 --> 28:05.683
Yeah, like he's
a wild animal. Yeah.

28:05.685 --> 28:07.584
Well, tell her about
the bunny, the bunny-python.

28:07.586 --> 28:10.254
- Oh, girl, you gonna love this.
- You're gonna love this one.

28:10.256 --> 28:13.323
Lemme tell you somethin'.
First of all, you need to appear unpredictable.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.558
- That's right.
- Alright?

28:14.560 --> 28:17.428
First, one day, you are
cute and vulnerable. Yes.

28:17.430 --> 28:19.797
- Just like a bunny, like a cute little bunny. Look at me.
- Yes, yes.

28:19.799 --> 28:23.000
And then next you are
irrational and stabby. Alright!

28:23.002 --> 28:25.169
- Crazy, you know?
- They love crazy pussy.

28:25.171 --> 28:26.336
- They love crazy pussy.
- They love it!

28:26.338 --> 28:28.939
Oh, my God!
I wanna try a bunny-python!

28:28.941 --> 28:31.875
<i>That's right, keep him on his toes.
That's how it keeps it real and fresh.</i>

28:31.877 --> 28:33.043
<i>- Yes.
- I like it.</i>

28:33.045 --> 28:34.611
- Mm-hmm.
- That's what you got to do.

28:34.613 --> 28:36.113
And then he'll just
keep coming back for more

28:36.115 --> 28:37.448
'cause he wants to fuck
that bunny out of you.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.249
- Yeah, you gotta step up, girl.
<i>- Oh!</i>

28:39.251 --> 28:41.051
You know what, Tyree,
the restraining order

28:41.053 --> 28:42.319
does not say
that you have to be rough.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.154
<i>Look, 100 feet
is 100 feet too, by the way.</i>

28:44.156 --> 28:46.724
<i>It's technical.
It's technical, girl.</i>

28:50.195 --> 28:54.098
- Well, that was...
- ...awesome! That was awesome.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.233
That was awesome.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.301
Who are you?

28:57.303 --> 28:59.770
- I'm.. I'm Anne, bitch!
- Whoa.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.572
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- It still doesn't work.

29:01.574 --> 29:03.640
- I hate calling other women bitches.
- Yeah, it's not good.

29:03.642 --> 29:04.975
- It's offensive and aggressive.
- It's... it's like a..

29:04.977 --> 29:07.945
It's anti-feminist.
It's gender specific violence.

29:07.947 --> 29:09.379
- Yeah.
- And it's just.. It's not for me.

29:09.381 --> 29:12.182
So let's cut bitch out maybe.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.784
Alright, cock chugger.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.234
<i>I could not imagine</i>

29:30.236 --> 29:34.238
not waking up next to that
beautiful man every day.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.207
<i>And I know that if we were
to spend our lives together</i>

29:37.209 --> 29:40.377
<i>it would mean that I could
become a customer</i>

29:40.379 --> 29:43.147
<i>at the Applebee's instead
of just a hostess.</i>

29:48.186 --> 29:50.487
No! What is she doing here?

29:50.489 --> 29:53.056
<i>And Elayna barges in.</i>

29:53.058 --> 29:56.160
June better keep her
hands off my man.

29:56.162 --> 29:58.095
<i>- What the fuck!
- What are you doing?</i>

29:58.097 --> 29:59.530
<i>This is Mike.
Oh!</i>

29:59.532 --> 30:01.131
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

30:01.133 --> 30:02.866
<i>That's kinda why I
came on the show</i>

30:02.868 --> 30:04.501
<i>is I wanted to, like..</i>

30:04.503 --> 30:07.738
...show kids that like a bunch
of women can fight over you

30:07.740 --> 30:09.339
even if you can't read.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.480
Coming. Coming!

30:16.482 --> 30:18.315
Sorry.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.119
Hey, oh, sorry. Oh!

30:22.121 --> 30:23.153
Did you sleep
in your leather jacket?

30:23.155 --> 30:24.154
Hmm?

30:24.156 --> 30:26.456
Did you sleep
in your leather jacket?

30:26.458 --> 30:27.758
Max gave it to me.

30:27.760 --> 30:30.027
I just wanted to seem like
the first time I wear it

30:30.029 --> 30:31.461
it's not the first time
I wear it, you know.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.864
Uh, well. Anyway, okay.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.232
So, I've had a lot of coffee..

30:35.234 --> 30:37.434
...but I've come up
with a plan for us.

30:37.436 --> 30:41.138
- You have to read these books.
- Ooh, "Tommy Land."

30:41.140 --> 30:44.541
Yeah. Uh, I took a peek.
It's a little..

30:44.543 --> 30:48.612
7th chapter,
AKA "You know what, fuck it."

30:48.614 --> 30:49.847
- Tommy.
- I know. He's great, right?

30:49.849 --> 30:51.582
A real way with the word.

30:51.584 --> 30:53.784
And, uh, we need a new look.

30:53.786 --> 30:54.786
So..

30:55.653 --> 30:57.487
...we're gonna go shopping.

30:57.489 --> 31:00.090
- I hate going shopping.
- We're goin' to the shops.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.759
We're gonna get cool new looks
and be cool new guys.

31:03.828 --> 31:04.995
Fine, can I get
a cinnamon bun?

31:04.997 --> 31:06.096
You can get a cinnamon bun.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.898
- Alright, give me 5 minutes.
- Okay.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.167
Um, I'm thinking
maybe we could stop for coffee.

31:10.169 --> 31:11.668
You don't need
any more coffee.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.003
I'm starting to crash.

31:14.906 --> 31:17.140
Can we get a cinnamon bun
before we go shopping?

31:17.142 --> 31:20.010
I don't know. I... I feel
like that might ruin our lunch.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.912
- Shouldn't we wait?
- I didn't eat anything yet.

31:21.914 --> 31:23.780
Oh, my gosh.
Who doesn't eat breakfast?

31:23.782 --> 31:25.983
Well, I got excited
about the cinnamon bun.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.818
Here we go, here's a spot.

31:32.423 --> 31:33.991
<i>I don't know how you go out of
the house without eating breakfast.</i>

31:33.993 --> 31:35.359
<i>Oh, man!</i>

31:35.361 --> 31:37.961
- Oh, my, what, uh..
- What is that?

31:37.963 --> 31:38.996
<i>Come on.</i>

31:40.198 --> 31:41.698
Okay, well,
we'll just get another...

31:41.700 --> 31:43.133
No, no, no, no, no.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.369
That lady took our spot
and this is part of our problem.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.237
We're too passive.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.506
Well, well, you're not..

31:49.508 --> 31:50.574
...I don't feel like...

31:50.576 --> 31:52.142
Hey, you took our spot!

31:53.444 --> 31:56.280
<i>Yeah, I'm talkin' to you,
you dumb fuck!</i>

31:56.282 --> 31:58.362
Lower your window
and start yelling at her.

32:00.184 --> 32:02.552
Okay. You're just..
Just stupid.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.688
You're..
Everything about you is shitty!

32:04.690 --> 32:07.991
You picked the wrong
white people to fuck with, you dumb fuck!

32:09.261 --> 32:10.894
Alright, I'm gonna go
to the glasses store.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.856
<i>- Oh, do I keep cursing?
- Yeah.</i>

32:14.766 --> 32:18.035
You know what,
you can do is you can eat shit!

32:18.037 --> 32:20.570
And then you can eat it
and shit!

32:20.572 --> 32:22.706
Fuckin' suckin' dicks,
fuck, yeah!

32:22.708 --> 32:25.075
You can suck a bag of dicks,
you stupid asshole!

32:25.077 --> 32:27.077
You're an ass, you're an ass!

32:27.079 --> 32:31.181
Lickin', fuck,
suckin' ass motherfucker!

32:31.183 --> 32:33.617
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

32:33.619 --> 32:35.659
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
fuck, fuck, fuck!

32:36.054 --> 32:39.022
Cock guzzlin' shit can!

32:39.024 --> 32:40.457
Suck my big dick!

32:40.459 --> 32:42.159
You put my balls in your mouth!

32:42.161 --> 32:45.595
I'll swish them around
like a pair of ice cubes!

32:45.597 --> 32:47.431
Stop!

32:49.233 --> 32:51.068
Fuckin' asshole.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.839
Gee, what a jerk.

32:57.175 --> 32:58.976
Oh, here we go.

32:58.978 --> 33:02.045
What the fuck,
you fuckin' whore?

33:02.047 --> 33:04.181
Oh, wait.
I know you're upset.

33:04.183 --> 33:05.916
Enrique and I
have called it quits.

33:05.918 --> 33:07.184
He said he was separated.

33:07.186 --> 33:08.352
Oh..

33:08.354 --> 33:10.187
...Principal Miller?

33:10.189 --> 33:11.555
Oh, shit.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.477
- You're not Enrique's wife!
- No.

33:16.561 --> 33:17.594
I'm just gonna..

33:17.596 --> 33:19.463
...pretend that didn't happen.

33:19.465 --> 33:20.630
Oh, boy.

33:25.536 --> 33:27.037
Finally, the cinnamon buns.

33:27.039 --> 33:29.673
- It's pretty good, right?
- It's amazing.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.208
You know when I was 14..

33:31.210 --> 33:33.443
...I used to come here
all the time.

33:33.445 --> 33:34.611
More like hang out
with my friends

33:34.613 --> 33:36.413
try and scope chicks out.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.215
You know how many girls
I picked up?

33:38.217 --> 33:39.716
- A bunch?
- Negative one.

33:39.718 --> 33:42.819
- Oh, God.
- 'Cause one ran away out of fear.

33:42.821 --> 33:45.088
I didn't have
very much luck either, I..

33:45.090 --> 33:46.757
...I got asked out
for the first time

33:46.759 --> 33:48.992
my first semester of college..

33:48.994 --> 33:50.594
...and I got so nervous that

33:50.596 --> 33:51.862
even though I got
all dressed up

33:51.864 --> 33:53.930
I just sat in my dorm room
all night and worried.

33:53.932 --> 33:55.132
Oh, my God!

33:55.134 --> 33:56.600
It was so embarrassing

33:56.602 --> 33:59.803
'cause I had class with
the guy and I had to stop going.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.004
Well, that ends today.

34:02.340 --> 34:04.508
That was then, this is now.

34:04.510 --> 34:05.575
Oh.

34:05.577 --> 34:06.877
- S.E. Hinton.
- S.E. Hinton.

34:06.879 --> 34:09.079
- That was then, this is now.
- Yeah, I got one.

34:10.248 --> 34:11.328
You were kinda slow.

34:13.618 --> 34:15.485
Um..

34:15.487 --> 34:17.219
...I'm really glad that
we're doin' this together

34:17.222 --> 34:19.922
'cause I feel like
you're not gonna judge me.

34:19.925 --> 34:21.757
No. Are you kidding?

34:21.760 --> 34:23.927
How could you judge someone
that's even..

34:23.929 --> 34:24.960
...dorkier than you are.

34:24.963 --> 34:26.263
Oh, God.
Am I worse than you?

34:26.264 --> 34:28.264
No, no. I'm King Dork.

34:28.266 --> 34:30.100
Yes, you are.

34:30.101 --> 34:32.668
- Mmm... question.
- Hmm.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.572
Can we return these clothes?
I feel like such an asshole.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.074
You have no idea the amount..

34:38.077 --> 34:40.976
...of ball and taint sweat
that I have right now.

34:40.978 --> 34:42.344
Wait, which is the taint?

34:42.347 --> 34:44.313
The taint
is between your balls..

34:44.315 --> 34:47.650
...and your, on your,
in your b-hole.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.152
Okay, so I don't have one.

34:50.021 --> 34:52.621
No... you have a vaint.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.038
Hey, dad.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.040
Jeffrey.

35:10.908 --> 35:12.109
<i>What've you got in your hair?</i>

35:12.111 --> 35:13.610
Um, a pomade.

35:14.812 --> 35:15.879
It's a look.

35:17.081 --> 35:18.915
I'm tryin' somethin' new.

35:21.486 --> 35:23.887
I'm just like..

35:23.889 --> 35:26.857
Girls don't like guys from
upper middle class Pennsylvania

35:26.859 --> 35:30.127
who are guidance counselors
who've never broken a bone.

35:30.129 --> 35:31.995
Right, what do they like?
Guys who..

35:31.997 --> 35:34.297
...look like they got dressed
in the dark? I don't..

35:34.299 --> 35:36.433
They want like..

35:36.435 --> 35:39.002
...bad boys who like,
know how to fix cars

35:39.004 --> 35:40.036
and like..

35:40.905 --> 35:42.072
...have been in fights.

35:46.544 --> 35:49.045
Is it... there's nothing
in my past that's like dark,

35:49.047 --> 35:51.982
or dangerous, or foreboding?
Nothing?

35:51.984 --> 35:54.251
- You ever hit me?
- No.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.585
Are you really my dad?

35:56.854 --> 35:58.989
Yeah, unless you know
something that I don't.

35:58.991 --> 36:01.491
There was never an uncle
that got like too handsy?

36:03.060 --> 36:05.061
- More like a weird...
- Yeah.

36:05.063 --> 36:06.663
- Pedophile uncle? No.
- Nothing like that?

36:06.665 --> 36:08.064
Your uncles are boring..

36:08.066 --> 36:09.466
...nice, nice men but..

36:10.536 --> 36:12.235
I mean..

36:12.237 --> 36:14.538
...why do you
need to be messed up?

36:14.540 --> 36:17.174
I don't know, dad.
I don't know.

36:17.176 --> 36:21.011
You ever try, like, any
romance with a girl? Like you..

36:22.413 --> 36:24.981
...you kinda notice
things about her, that, uh

36:24.983 --> 36:27.651
you know, things that she,
she really likes?

36:27.653 --> 36:30.387
And then you, uh, you show her
that those things

36:30.389 --> 36:32.189
are what makes her
special to you.

36:32.191 --> 36:34.925
That's kind of... romance.

36:35.826 --> 36:36.993
It works.

36:38.229 --> 36:39.563
I'll give it a shot.

37:00.318 --> 37:01.551
Nice shot.

37:01.553 --> 37:02.919
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

37:02.921 --> 37:05.121
Sorry. Excuse me.
I know you're playin' a game.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.625
It's just not great design
to have a horizontal game

37:08.627 --> 37:10.427
in a vertical bar.

37:10.429 --> 37:12.662
- This place is neat though.
- Yeah, yeah.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.097
- Let's get some drinks, huh?
- Yeah.

37:14.099 --> 37:16.600
Um... what do we drink?

37:16.602 --> 37:17.834
Something hard?

37:17.836 --> 37:19.336
Yeah. Let's not do
white wine or beer.

37:19.338 --> 37:20.470
Yeah, um...

37:20.472 --> 37:21.905
What pairs well with a
cinnamon bun?

37:21.907 --> 37:24.107
- That's all I had today.
- Whiskey?

37:24.109 --> 37:25.542
- Yeah, 2 whiskies.
- No, I, um..

37:25.544 --> 37:27.811
I don't like the way
whiskey tastes.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.412
Could you get me one of those..

37:29.414 --> 37:31.514
...take things that like,
has a bunch of alcohol in it?

37:31.516 --> 37:32.782
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.884
- Yeah, like a hard tea.
- Yeah, like a cider.

37:34.886 --> 37:37.520
- Or a cider. Yes, no problem.
- Yeah, yeah. Cool, thank you.

37:37.522 --> 37:40.090
I just, I'm, I'm sorry.
Just to be clear..

37:40.092 --> 37:42.792
...do you have a specific kind
of flavor that you want?

37:42.794 --> 37:45.362
You know,
just make a decision.

37:45.364 --> 37:47.204
- I'm sorry.
- What the fuck!

37:48.132 --> 37:49.266
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

37:49.268 --> 37:51.601
- That was my fault.
- I am so sorry.

37:51.603 --> 37:52.802
I'm sorry.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.537
She pushed me
and I hit your friend

37:54.539 --> 37:56.039
and your friend threw the dart
and it landed in your leg

37:56.041 --> 37:57.107
and that's not good.

37:57.109 --> 37:58.608
<i>But, but, but..</i>

37:58.610 --> 38:00.710
...I think that you will see
if we could just talk it out

38:00.712 --> 38:02.512
and let, let, let us buy you
a round of drinks.

38:02.514 --> 38:04.881
Yeah, let's reset.
Let's press the pause button.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.751
Let's press pause.
Okay, I'm Anne.

38:07.753 --> 38:10.020
- Ha, this is Anne. I'm Jeff.
- Hi, how are you?

38:10.022 --> 38:11.354
- Is this your man here?
- Oh, he's not.

38:11.356 --> 38:13.423
He's a co-worker
and a very close friend.

38:13.425 --> 38:15.759
W... whoa, one second.
I can explain.

38:18.263 --> 38:21.431
Look, I know, I... I know
that, that was not good, but..

38:21.433 --> 38:23.199
...but I, but I've never
been in a fight before

38:23.201 --> 38:24.267
and I don't mean to
physically altercate now.

38:24.269 --> 38:25.502
Then I'm sorry.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.304
Oh, Jeff.

38:27.306 --> 38:28.738
I have been..

38:30.242 --> 38:33.643
...waiting to do that
all night long.

38:39.383 --> 38:40.917
<i>Jeff..</i>

38:40.919 --> 38:42.218
I just knocked a guy
out at the bar.

38:42.220 --> 38:43.953
<i>That was kinda cool.</i>

38:43.955 --> 38:45.922
That was kinda cool.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.644
- We should go.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

38:47.825 --> 38:49.326
What's up?

38:49.328 --> 38:51.795
There's more for
either one of you if you want.

38:51.797 --> 38:53.363
More of the bee stings.

38:53.365 --> 38:55.465
No. There's nothing more.
Let's just get out of here.

38:55.467 --> 38:58.668
- Wow, that was awesome.
- Hey, are you okay?

38:58.670 --> 39:01.071
That guy's such a douche.

39:01.073 --> 39:03.573
Let me know
if you need a little TLC.

39:09.447 --> 39:10.513
Whoa.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.115
Oh, my God.
They're so pretty.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.718
Oh, my God. I think I'm just
gonna start punchin' people out.

39:14.720 --> 39:15.985
You should.
It's like an aphrodisiac.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.153
I guess so.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.055
Wow.

39:22.127 --> 39:23.626
<i>I kinda did something.</i>

39:25.896 --> 39:27.497
Jesus.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.499
- What'd you do?
- It's a new look.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.569
Why did you do this
to your beautiful hair?

39:32.571 --> 39:33.770
Well, Jeff said I was
inhibited

39:33.772 --> 39:35.004
and it ticked me off, so.

39:35.006 --> 39:36.840
You did it for Jeff.

39:36.842 --> 39:39.109
- That is so cliche, Julia.
- What? What?

39:39.111 --> 39:40.577
Oh, the 2 single people
in the room

39:40.579 --> 39:41.878
automatically belong together.

39:41.880 --> 39:45.315
No. I'm just saying
he's cute, you're adorable.

39:45.317 --> 39:48.017
And you both are cool. Listen,
I just want you to be happy.

39:48.019 --> 39:49.452
I am happy. I'm very happy.

39:49.454 --> 39:51.521
I just,
I don't see Jeff that way.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.189
Look, I..

39:53.191 --> 39:55.358
...I think you called me over
to brush your hair out.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.926
- Yes.
- Yeah, okay.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.428
You can handle this yourself.

39:58.430 --> 40:00.897
I am feeling so much
electricity in both nips.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.799
I gotta go and... relieve this.

40:02.801 --> 40:04.634
Whoa, that sounds bad.

40:04.636 --> 40:06.469
It is bad.
I could charge a car.

40:06.471 --> 40:10.140
Well, if you're hungry though
I can just order a quick pie.

40:10.142 --> 40:12.809
Uh... please... please don't
take offense to this, okay?

40:12.811 --> 40:15.345
I just don't know how else
and I've got to say something..

40:16.714 --> 40:18.715
...I feel like
sometimes your needs..

40:20.317 --> 40:22.598
...are like a little
comparable to my baby's needs.

40:24.488 --> 40:28.124
How could I have
ever taken that the wrong way?

40:28.126 --> 40:30.927
<i>That's great. I get it.
No, I know. I just..</i>

40:30.929 --> 40:32.529
I just,
I don't have that many friends.

40:32.531 --> 40:35.799
So I always
tend to call you. Sorry.

40:35.801 --> 40:36.966
That makes me really sad.

40:36.968 --> 40:39.235
No. I didn't mean to
make you sad. I just..

40:39.237 --> 40:41.104
You're my best friend
so I will always call you.

40:41.106 --> 40:43.306
But I'll back off
so babies can eat.

40:43.308 --> 40:44.441
I love you.

40:44.443 --> 40:45.608
- Okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

40:45.610 --> 40:47.477
I'm gonna go
take a hot shower

40:47.479 --> 40:49.646
put plenty of conditioner
in there and just comb it out.

40:49.648 --> 40:51.014
<i>Okay.</i>

40:51.016 --> 40:52.849
Got a big box
of mac and cheese.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.451
<i>Please don't finish that.</i>

40:54.453 --> 40:55.618
You stay, I won't.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.454
Bye.

40:57.456 --> 40:59.576
Come on, I'll make you
some Greek yogurt.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.464
<i>Diana..</i>

41:09.233 --> 41:10.733
...you've been set free.

41:14.972 --> 41:17.340
I hated to see Diana go.

41:17.342 --> 41:18.508
But..

41:18.510 --> 41:21.678
...now I can focus
on the remaining two.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.013
<i>The girls wonder why
I keep Elayna around.</i>

41:25.549 --> 41:28.284
<i>But I know she's here for me.</i>

41:28.286 --> 41:31.621
- I'm sweet as cherry pie.
- Just don't cross me.

41:33.424 --> 41:35.124
I'm sweet as cherry pie.

41:35.126 --> 41:36.626
Just don't cross me.

41:40.098 --> 41:42.532
<i>Hi, my name is Anne.</i>

41:42.534 --> 41:44.701
I'm workin' on a new accent.

41:44.703 --> 41:46.836
I think it's gonna
give me my edge.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.204
What do you think?

41:48.206 --> 41:50.807
Yeah, no, it's... it's
certainly intriguing.

41:50.809 --> 41:53.643
I've been trying but I
can't seem to not sound like..

41:54.545 --> 41:55.678
A plantation owner?

41:55.680 --> 41:57.313
Like a
racist plantation owner.

41:57.315 --> 41:59.482
And that's not
what I wanna put out there.

41:59.484 --> 42:00.750
Okay. I'll keep working on it.

42:00.752 --> 42:01.818
Yeah.

42:01.820 --> 42:03.586
If you wanna
see something cool..

42:03.588 --> 42:05.755
- I do..
- You wanna see something cool?

42:05.757 --> 42:06.923
Uh-huh. Yeah.

42:08.292 --> 42:10.860
- Oh my God, is that a tattoo?
- Yeah.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.495
- What is that? It's a book?
- Yeah.

42:12.497 --> 42:14.664
Yeah, I got it in,
in honor of book club.

42:16.133 --> 42:18.253
Would the new you
be a part of a book club?

42:20.404 --> 42:22.839
That's a good, uh..
I didn't think about that.

42:22.841 --> 42:25.842
But you know what, when I go
back for my second round..

42:25.844 --> 42:29.078
...then I'll tell them
maybe we'll switch the design.

42:29.080 --> 42:31.981
See, right now, a lot of people
think that when you get a tattoo

42:31.983 --> 42:33.550
you go into the parlor

42:33.552 --> 42:35.084
and then you just
walk out with a tattoo, but..

42:35.086 --> 42:36.252
That's what I thought.

42:36.254 --> 42:39.389
No, actually,
it's a lot of steps.

42:39.391 --> 42:42.158
I mean, first you go
into the stencil stage..

42:42.160 --> 42:43.793
...and then you go
into the next stage

42:43.795 --> 42:45.562
which is the stage
that I'm in which is the

42:45.564 --> 42:46.996
"Are you comfortable
with this image

42:46.998 --> 42:48.331
"on your skin forever phase."

42:48.333 --> 42:51.034
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna
pause you right there.

42:51.036 --> 42:52.802
I see where you're
going with this.

42:52.804 --> 42:55.572
Um... are you in the "I'm afraid
of needle phase?"

42:55.574 --> 42:57.473
Oh my God, it was so scary.

42:57.475 --> 42:58.608
- I can't do that.
- No.

42:58.610 --> 43:00.209
The needle
is attached to a motor.

43:00.211 --> 43:01.377
And it goes like..

43:02.980 --> 43:04.781
You're not gonna put your
skin under that. No way.

43:04.783 --> 43:05.949
I don't like it.

43:05.951 --> 43:07.750
So I'll just leave it
stenciled for a while.

43:07.752 --> 43:09.319
You have a drawing
on your arm.

43:09.321 --> 43:11.854
- Way to go. I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

43:11.856 --> 43:12.856
Mm-hmm.

43:14.124 --> 43:16.392
Oh my God,
look at this chick.

43:16.394 --> 43:18.227
That is awesome. Good for her.

43:20.097 --> 43:21.598
- I'm gonna get up on the bar.
- What?

43:21.600 --> 43:23.032
I'm gonna get up on the bar.

43:23.034 --> 43:24.534
You could barely get off
the bar stool.

43:24.536 --> 43:26.776
- I know, but I'm gonna try.
- Hold on one second.

43:36.981 --> 43:38.901
I'm putting this

45:00.065 --> 45:01.164

45:23.821 --> 45:25.288

45:25.290 --> 45:27.890
- I liked your moves, I did.
- Oh, yeah?

45:27.892 --> 45:30.026
Was that like the window
into your soul?

45:30.028 --> 45:31.594
Um..

45:31.596 --> 45:33.896
- That's deep. That's so deep.
- That's exactly what it is.

45:33.898 --> 45:35.131
- Yeah.

45:38.269 --> 45:40.069
Oh, I see it in your eyes.

45:40.071 --> 45:41.437
You want a beer?

45:41.439 --> 45:43.506
I'd love a beer.
You got anything stronger?

45:43.508 --> 45:44.607
Very strong.

- Okay.
- Very strong.

Cheers.
Cheers.

46:03.494 --> 46:05.328
Mm-mm-mm.

46:06.663 --> 46:09.198
So, a southern girl.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.601
Oh, yes, well, I am.
I mean, I'm definitely..

46:11.603 --> 46:13.703
...dyed in the
wool southern girl. But I..

46:13.705 --> 46:16.539
...I will be the first
to admit that, you know..

46:16.541 --> 46:19.275
...there is a bit
of a checkered history for the south.

46:19.277 --> 46:21.010
You know, I mean?

46:21.012 --> 46:22.678
Human rights conditions and..

46:24.014 --> 46:26.282
...historical denying and..

46:26.284 --> 46:28.117
...you know, some sort of..

46:28.119 --> 46:29.652
...animal cruelty and what not.

46:29.654 --> 46:31.320
But you know, it's the south.

46:33.357 --> 46:35.691
The south is always nice.

46:36.527 --> 46:38.494
There's a bunch of..

46:38.496 --> 46:41.764
...bunch of books out that you
can read about the south.

46:41.766 --> 46:43.199
If you want me to give you..

46:43.201 --> 46:44.333
...southern history lesson

46:44.335 --> 46:45.935
I'll definitely see
if I can fit you in.

46:45.937 --> 46:47.370
You can give me
one on one, right?

46:47.372 --> 46:48.504
Oh!

46:48.506 --> 46:50.807
Well, that's third base
where I come from.

46:50.809 --> 46:53.376
Hmm, well then,
why don't we slide into home.

46:53.378 --> 46:55.298
Oh, my!
I don't know about that.

46:56.380 --> 46:57.747
Uh..

46:57.749 --> 46:59.415
...I'm gonna powder my nose.

to work over at Happy Place.</i>

50:07.871 --> 50:09.705
<i>Too many tabs? Don't answer.</i>

50:09.707 --> 50:11.787
<i>I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm fine by myself.</i>

50:12.776 --> 50:14.110
<i>Bye, text me.</i>

50:18.115 --> 50:19.448
Oh, hi.

50:21.018 --> 50:22.018
Hi.

50:23.754 --> 50:26.122
- You look good.
- Well, you know.

50:26.124 --> 50:28.424
Bandanas and necklaces.

50:28.426 --> 50:30.393
- I like it.
- Do you like it?

50:30.395 --> 50:32.595
Yeah, me likey.

50:32.597 --> 50:34.797
- Well, you look good.
- I know.

50:34.799 --> 50:37.633
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

50:37.635 --> 50:39.201
Where you been?
I feel like I haven't seen you.

50:39.203 --> 50:41.871
I know. It's been
kind of like... a minute.

50:44.641 --> 50:46.175
So what's goin' on with you?

50:46.177 --> 50:47.343
None of your business.

50:48.545 --> 50:49.745
Why so many questions?

50:49.747 --> 50:51.914
- I don't know.
- What, am I under arrest?

50:54.618 --> 50:57.420
Why you chewing on
all this weird shit?

50:57.422 --> 50:58.821
'Cause I'm hungry.

50:58.823 --> 51:00.656
What's weird about a straw?

51:00.658 --> 51:03.059
Nothing. It's just the second thing
you've been chewin' on.

51:03.061 --> 51:04.093
Come on. Let's take a picture.

51:04.095 --> 51:05.095
Oh, alright.

51:06.963 --> 51:07.963
Oops.

51:10.467 --> 51:11.534
Whoop!

51:12.803 --> 51:13.836
Okay, the light's about to go.

51:13.838 --> 51:14.838
Okay.

51:18.408 --> 51:19.442
Wow!

51:22.045 --> 51:25.047
- Let's look like we're wasted.
- Oh, I'm so wasted.

51:36.193 --> 51:37.526
Do you wanna get outta here?

51:38.328 --> 51:39.361
Yeah.

51:41.298 --> 51:42.978
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

51:43.667 --> 51:45.401
- You gotta duck under, okay?
- Okay.

51:45.403 --> 51:47.169
<i>- Let's go to the bar.
- Okay.</i>

51:47.171 --> 51:48.971
You are bossy.

51:48.973 --> 51:49.972
I'm going to go
to the bathroom.

51:49.974 --> 51:51.854
Okay, I'm gonna hang out here.

51:54.579 --> 51:56.011
<i>Anne Martin.</i>

51:56.013 --> 51:57.313
Hi, Beth Foster.

51:57.315 --> 52:00.916
Um, my son Brian is a freshman
at Thomas Jefferson.

52:00.918 --> 52:02.418
Yeah, Brian.

52:02.420 --> 52:03.819
- Yeah.
- You know Brian?

52:03.821 --> 52:06.989
- He's a cute little guy.
- He's into space and rocks.

52:08.826 --> 52:10.526
- Space and rocks.
- Yeah. He's a sweetie.

52:10.528 --> 52:12.061
Yeah. He's so sweet.

52:12.063 --> 52:13.729
Um, hey, I... I wondered.

52:13.731 --> 52:16.265
Are you here with... with
Jeff Lowry?

52:16.267 --> 52:17.800
- Oh, yeah. I mean, no.
- Uh-huh.

52:17.802 --> 52:19.235
I mean..

52:19.237 --> 52:20.269
...oh, you know Jeff?

52:20.271 --> 52:21.837
We met at the gym.

52:21.839 --> 52:23.639
Uh, like, several weeks back.

52:23.641 --> 52:26.075
And, um, while we..

52:26.077 --> 52:28.777
...we've been like hangin' out.

52:28.779 --> 52:30.679
Kind of here and there
in the afternoon and..

52:30.681 --> 52:32.281
I just don't wanna
step on any toes.

52:32.283 --> 52:34.383
Oh, so you guys
are seeing each other?

52:34.385 --> 52:36.452
It's too early to tell.
I mean, I... I

52:36.454 --> 52:37.786
I'm workin' on dinner.

52:38.922 --> 52:40.289
Hi.

52:40.291 --> 52:42.358
Hello. Hey, Beth.

52:42.360 --> 52:43.993
- Hi.
- Hey.

52:43.995 --> 52:45.261
- Hey.
- So good to see you.

52:45.263 --> 52:46.595
So good to see you, yeah.

52:46.597 --> 52:48.898
I see you met
my good friend, Anne.

52:48.900 --> 52:50.299
I did.

52:50.301 --> 52:52.635
Yeah, Jeff and I
are really good friends.

52:54.471 --> 52:56.005
Incredibly close.

52:56.007 --> 52:58.307
- I'd like to think we are.
- Mm-hmm.

52:58.309 --> 52:59.808
That's awesome.

53:01.778 --> 53:02.978
- Beth?
<i>- Yeah, Beth.</i>

53:02.980 --> 53:06.916
Um, you have a
high school-aged child..

53:06.918 --> 53:09.985
<i>...who's going on and on and
on about your afternoons together.</i>

53:09.987 --> 53:12.121
She was saying that,
uh, you guys spend

53:12.123 --> 53:13.389
a lot of time together.

53:13.391 --> 53:15.691
And she'd love it
if you took her out to dinner.

53:15.693 --> 53:17.293
And she was kinda
hoping for that, right, Beth?

53:17.295 --> 53:18.427
- Oh, well.
- Oh, were you?

53:18.429 --> 53:21.864
I mean, uh,
that'd be great. Whatever.

53:21.866 --> 53:24.600
No, it's ca..
We're both, we're casual.

53:24.602 --> 53:25.734
- Yeah.
- That's funny.

53:25.736 --> 53:27.870
I just got a casual text myself.

53:27.872 --> 53:30.592
- While you were in the bathroom..
- Mm-hm.

53:31.474 --> 53:32.741
One or two?

53:32.743 --> 53:34.710
I don't know, why that.
Number 1 obviously.

53:34.712 --> 53:36.946
Number 2. To be back
that quickly would be..

53:36.948 --> 53:38.314
- Oh, well, I don't know.
- Obviously, I was being...

53:38.316 --> 53:39.848
You're very quick.
He has IBS

53:39.850 --> 53:41.250
so I know it comes out quickly.

53:41.252 --> 53:42.818
I have IBS.

53:42.820 --> 53:44.253
Well, while you were..

53:44.255 --> 53:46.088
...peeing or shitting
or whatever..

53:46.090 --> 53:49.091
...I got a text from Max..

53:49.093 --> 53:52.528
...who wanted to know
if I would go to The Lounge with him.

53:52.530 --> 53:54.196
Oh, I love The Lounge.

53:55.065 --> 53:57.600
Um, so I was thinking maybe..

53:57.602 --> 53:59.468
...I would go.

53:59.470 --> 54:00.636
What do you think?

54:02.639 --> 54:06.141
I think you should do
whatever you wanna do.

54:08.378 --> 54:09.712
That's what I'll do.

54:11.848 --> 54:13.482
Well, Beth, it was
really great talking to you.

54:13.484 --> 54:14.550
So great to see you.

54:14.552 --> 54:16.552
Um, good luck with your..

54:16.554 --> 54:17.953
...son.

54:17.955 --> 54:19.521
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

54:19.523 --> 54:21.523
She doesn't like me or...

54:21.525 --> 54:24.293
No, she likes you fine.
She likes you fine.

54:24.295 --> 54:26.128
<i>She doesn't like
my son at all...</i>

54:26.130 --> 54:28.570
<i>No, no, no, no. She likes
your son. She likes your son.</i>

54:33.436 --> 54:35.504
Um, so how... how have
you been? What's goin' on?

54:35.506 --> 54:37.840
Oh, um, I've been great,
actually. Um..

54:38.842 --> 54:40.776
...kinda having fun.

54:40.778 --> 54:42.311
Havin' a lot of sex, actually.

54:42.313 --> 54:44.113
<i>Sex is when the penis
goes in the vagina, right?</i>

54:44.115 --> 54:45.881
- Yes, it is.
- Just playing with you.

54:45.883 --> 54:47.583
You'll get there.
You guys will get back there.

54:47.585 --> 54:49.351
But you're gonna
go through dry periods too.

54:49.353 --> 54:50.452
It's not a big deal.

54:50.454 --> 54:51.820
- Yes, yes.
- Not me.

54:51.822 --> 54:55.457
I feel like I went through
my dry period and I'm..

54:55.459 --> 54:56.959
...goin' through my wet period.

54:56.961 --> 54:58.894
I guess
I kinda have a slutty side.

54:58.896 --> 55:01.230
But you're wearing
protection, right?

55:01.232 --> 55:03.732
Of course
I'm wearing protection.

55:03.734 --> 55:05.634
I don't.. It's not that
I think you're having like

55:05.636 --> 55:07.269
sex with homeless guys
or anything.

55:07.271 --> 55:09.972
<i>And if you were, more power
to you. I just mean..</i>

55:09.974 --> 55:11.940
...you know, you gotta be
careful because sometimes

55:11.942 --> 55:15.644
beautiful packages are filled
with AIDS. You don't know.

55:15.646 --> 55:17.379
I'm not sleeping
with anyone with it.

55:17.381 --> 55:18.981
I, I wear co.. I'm..

55:18.983 --> 55:20.783
Yes, I'm fine.
I'm good. I'm not an idiot.

55:20.785 --> 55:22.818
- Hey, no. Good, good.
- Sounds a little judgy.

55:22.820 --> 55:24.286
But you know..
I'm sorry. I just.

55:24.288 --> 55:25.954
I care about you.
I'm using protection.

55:25.956 --> 55:27.489
If you're like bangin'
the whole neighborhood

55:27.491 --> 55:29.525
you should protect yourself,
you know.

55:29.527 --> 55:31.493
Well, if I manage to bang
the whole neighborhood

55:31.495 --> 55:35.164
I will use protection, so..
You're upsetting your daughter.

55:35.166 --> 55:37.566
Um... so you guys, wow.

55:37.568 --> 55:39.501
Just look at her. She's so big.

55:39.503 --> 55:40.736
She is getting big.

55:40.738 --> 55:42.705
She's eating all the time.

55:42.707 --> 55:44.940
It's crazy that we have to
baby-proof the house right now.

55:44.942 --> 55:46.175
And it's just like nonstop...

55:46.177 --> 55:48.043
<i>Never ending. Doesn't stop.</i>

55:48.045 --> 55:50.679
It doesn't stop.
And Al loves modern furniture

55:50.681 --> 55:52.014
so we have all these like..

55:52.016 --> 55:53.949
...angled tables and chairs.

55:53.951 --> 55:56.552
Anyway, we have to protect,
we have to pad everything for the baby.

55:56.554 --> 55:58.654
It's been a tornado.

55:58.656 --> 56:00.956
Yeah. Must..

56:00.958 --> 56:03.559
Must be hard.
I guess, I feel like..

56:03.561 --> 56:05.327
...the only thing is,
is that every..

56:05.329 --> 56:06.395
Thank you.

56:06.397 --> 56:09.198
Uh, everybody is
always kinda like..

56:09.200 --> 56:12.167
Oh, man, so hard. Like,
we gotta baby-proof our pool

56:12.169 --> 56:13.469
and like..

56:13.471 --> 56:16.071
...this is so rough,
we never sleep and honestly..

56:16.073 --> 56:17.806
...if it was so fuckin' hard,

56:17.808 --> 56:19.475
why is everybody even havin'
babies for like

56:19.477 --> 56:20.876
thousands of years.

56:20.878 --> 56:22.378
Please don't swear
in front of the baby.

56:22.380 --> 56:25.180
<i>She's not gonna absorb
the word "Fuck" at a brunch.</i>

56:25.182 --> 56:26.582
<i>- There it is again.
- Oh, my God.</i>

56:26.584 --> 56:28.450
See, this is..

56:28.452 --> 56:29.985
This is why I really thought

56:29.987 --> 56:31.320
it was gonna be the
two of us today.

56:31.322 --> 56:33.255
I didn't realize
it was a family outing with like

56:33.257 --> 56:36.792
Mr. Checks and Balances
over here.

56:36.794 --> 56:38.093
Honestly, it seems to me like

56:38.095 --> 56:39.762
because you're not
having any fun

56:39.764 --> 56:41.063
nobody else can have any fun.

56:41.065 --> 56:43.098
I want you to have fun.
And by the way..

56:43.100 --> 56:44.500
...I'm having tons of fun.

56:44.502 --> 56:45.701
I'm having so much fun.

56:45.703 --> 56:48.070
I love my baby. And I love Al.

56:48.072 --> 56:50.739
Okay? I just have a lot going
on and it's super stressful.

56:50.741 --> 56:53.861
And sometimes I don't know
which hat to wear when I'm with who.

56:54.411 --> 56:55.911
This sucks.

56:55.913 --> 56:59.314
I feel kinda like,
I don't wanna be here right now.

56:59.316 --> 57:00.649
I'm sorry, I just..

57:01.885 --> 57:04.052
- I gotta go.
- Where are you going?

57:04.054 --> 57:07.022
I, I, you know what,
I just, I gotta go. I just..

57:07.024 --> 57:09.425
Where are you go..
What could you possibly doing right now?

57:09.427 --> 57:10.459
I have a date.

57:10.461 --> 57:11.593
You have a date
in the morning?

57:11.595 --> 57:13.715
Yeah, I have a date.
I've a morning date.

57:16.399 --> 57:19.001
- She doesn't have a date.
- She doesn't have a date.

57:19.003 --> 57:20.335
I have a date.

57:28.945 --> 57:30.279
Oh, my God.

57:31.948 --> 57:34.049
Suck it.

57:34.051 --> 57:37.085
That's what happens
when you mess with the bull.

57:37.087 --> 57:39.755
- You're very good at darts.
- Yeah, I got better.

57:40.757 --> 57:43.592
Do you maybe wanna get goin'?

57:45.061 --> 57:48.664
I mean, I have to go,
so, uh, I just..

57:48.666 --> 57:50.132
Do you wanna come?

57:50.134 --> 57:53.068
Um, you know,
I think I'm gonna stay.

57:53.070 --> 57:54.603
Okay, yeah.

57:54.605 --> 57:56.438
- Just kinda chill.
- Okay.

57:58.007 --> 58:00.642
Uh... awesome to see you.

58:00.644 --> 58:01.810
Good to see you.

58:02.846 --> 58:04.847
- Okay.
- Cool.

58:06.783 --> 58:08.383
- Bye.
- Bye.

58:08.385 --> 58:09.718
Hey, wait, come here.

58:18.027 --> 58:20.262
- Okay.
- Alright.

58:20.264 --> 58:22.064
- See you.
- I'll call you.

58:22.765 --> 58:23.765
Okay.

58:26.135 --> 58:28.270
<i>Next week
on the dramatic conclusion</i>

58:28.272 --> 58:29.738
<i>of "Prisoner Of Love".</i>

58:29.740 --> 58:31.607
<i>I didn't expect
to fall in love.</i>

58:31.609 --> 58:33.041
But I'm grateful that I did.

58:33.043 --> 58:35.210
<i>As Johnny's prison term
comes to a close.</i>

58:35.212 --> 58:38.680
<i>The shocking verdict you've
been waiting for all summer.</i>

58:38.682 --> 58:41.517
I wanna thank you both
for doing time with me.

58:41.519 --> 58:43.485
<i>Unfortunately,
I gotta let one of you go.</i>

58:43.487 --> 58:45.654
<i>Two women could hold
the key to Johnny's heart.</i>

58:45.656 --> 58:49.124
<i>But only one will serve
a life sentence.</i>

58:49.126 --> 58:51.927
<i>I don't know what I'll do
if Johnny doesn't pick me.</i>

58:51.929 --> 58:53.595
I'm unstable, y'all.

Jeff!
Anne!

59:08.578 --> 59:09.578
Hey.

59:10.580 --> 59:12.180
- Hi.
- What's up?

59:13.516 --> 59:15.317
What's up with you?

59:15.319 --> 59:16.885
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
make too much noise.

59:16.887 --> 59:18.887
I won't wake up
Beth or anything!

59:20.990 --> 59:22.491
Well..

59:22.493 --> 59:24.660
...okay then.

59:24.662 --> 59:25.994
What's goin' on?

59:27.497 --> 59:29.464
Why you so interested
what's goin' on in here?

59:29.466 --> 59:30.699
Aren't you dating Max now?

59:30.701 --> 59:32.601
I'm not here
to talk about Max.

59:32.603 --> 59:34.937
I'm here to talk to you.

59:34.939 --> 59:36.819
In the last week,
I just, like..

59:37.440 --> 59:39.320
I can't stop thinking about you.

59:41.678 --> 59:43.011
It's making me feel crazy.

59:48.418 --> 59:49.418
Wow.

59:50.587 --> 59:52.587
I mean, I used to
think about you too.

59:54.490 --> 59:55.857
You never noticed so...

59:55.859 --> 59:59.194
I didn't notice.
Why didn't you say anything?

59:59.196 --> 01:00:00.762
Because, I don't know,
I don't know,

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:02.531
it seemed like you didn't..

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.435
...just didn't have the same..

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:14.943
Look, Anne. I've come
to a good place in my life finally.

01:00:16.813 --> 01:00:18.981
Moved on. I think
you should too.

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:23.552
Just move on,
just walk away, and..

01:00:23.554 --> 01:00:25.921
There's just nothing
to talk about?

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:29.992
Thought is free.

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:33.996
- What is that?
- It's a quote.

01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:36.365
It's Elizabethan.

01:00:36.367 --> 01:00:37.666
Yeah, I'm not even gonna
tell you.

01:00:37.668 --> 01:00:39.668
I'm gonna..
I'm gonna give you time.

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:45.140
Is that how we sounded when
we used to play that game?

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:46.775
'Cause it's pathetic.

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:54.282
Fuck you.

01:00:56.919 --> 01:00:59.087
I mean, we're.. We're
guessing quotes from books?

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:00.288
It's like...

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.924
Fuck you.
That's a quote from me.

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:05.560
Shit.

01:01:13.903 --> 01:01:15.871
Oh, I got the machine again.

01:01:15.873 --> 01:01:17.806
- It's not a machine.
- What?

01:01:17.808 --> 01:01:19.374
They're in the phone service.

01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:21.410
Oh, hi, Jeff.
It's your mom.

01:01:21.412 --> 01:01:23.512
I got your message that
you're not coming today

01:01:23.514 --> 01:01:25.313
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:01:25.315 --> 01:01:27.649
Uh, but at least we'll see you
for my birthday.

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:32.421
Yeah, I love you.
Uh, I... it's your mom.

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:36.291
That was good.

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:38.694
- Yeah?
- Yeah, not too much pressure.

01:01:38.696 --> 01:01:40.256
- I try.
- Yeah.

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:45.801
Yeah, it says
"Look, Slim's bitch got a litter now."

01:01:45.803 --> 01:01:47.235
It's... it's not
his girlfriend. It was..

01:01:47.237 --> 01:01:48.804
They were talking about the dog.

01:01:48.806 --> 01:01:50.272
Mmm.

01:01:50.274 --> 01:01:52.874
I thought
she was just messy.

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:55.410
<i>Is he not coming?</i>
He didn't even call to cancel.

01:01:55.412 --> 01:01:58.080
My therapist has
a 24 hour cancellation policy.

01:01:58.082 --> 01:01:59.347
And she's strict about it.

01:01:59.349 --> 01:02:00.949
So if you cancel,
how much you have to pay?

01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:03.852
She charges me like $300,
and she calls my parents.

01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:06.521
- Why?
- Well, I asked her to.

01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:08.724
Look. Guys, what do you say
we just pack it in, yeah?

01:02:08.726 --> 01:02:09.858
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.992
Let's just pack it
in to your place.

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:12.060
Yeah, let's go to your place?

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:14.429
Uh, yeah, the... there's

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:16.398
kinda of a big
difference between

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.835
joining a book club
and hosting one, so..

01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:21.903
- This is all we have, man.
- This is.. It's all we have.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:23.472
This is it.

01:02:23.474 --> 01:02:27.909
I mean, this book club
is what... is what we have.

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:30.112
I'm looking right at you
and I can tell that's true.

01:02:30.114 --> 01:02:32.380
<i>- Yeah.
- And you guys are taking that really hard.</i>

01:02:32.382 --> 01:02:34.616
I know, it's just like what
happened to Jeff?

01:02:34.618 --> 01:02:36.318
You know? Who likes
what he's become now?

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.053
- I don't.
- I don't.

01:02:38.055 --> 01:02:39.921
Guys, I think we should be
happy for our friend, alright?

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:41.656
I mean, he wanted to make
a change, he did that

01:02:41.658 --> 01:02:43.225
and now he's out there doing
what he wants.

01:02:43.227 --> 01:02:45.026
Did he make a change?
He likes Anne now.

01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:46.061
Is that really a change

01:02:46.063 --> 01:02:47.262
or is that just more like

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:48.563
"Oh, I've decided
to like this girl."

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:51.600
Wait, what do you mean
he likes Anne?

01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:53.235
I think he's got, like,
feelings for Anne now.

01:02:53.237 --> 01:02:54.603
That's why
he's acting so crazy.

01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:56.705
I don't know.
My brother's girlfriend's dad.

01:02:56.707 --> 01:02:58.206
- Rick.
- Rick.

01:02:58.208 --> 01:03:00.709
- Rickolas.
- Dude, his birth given name is not Richard.

01:03:00.711 --> 01:03:01.810
It's Rickolas.

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:05.280
Asshole of a man found
this on the ground.

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:07.182
Told me to give it back to him.
Total shithead by the way.

01:03:07.184 --> 01:03:09.985
He really is a piece
of human garbage.

01:03:09.987 --> 01:03:12.320
Ah, Jeff.

01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:14.322
Whoa, is that what you do
in a photo booth?

01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:16.758
That's what they did.
That's four versions of what they did.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.627
- Yeah.
- You could do whatever you want.

01:03:19.863 --> 01:03:21.296
It makes sense though,
you know?

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.365
She's a plain Jane,
and, you know

01:03:23.367 --> 01:03:25.467
he's a shell of
a boring human being, so.

01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:27.002
I guess it works out.

01:03:27.004 --> 01:03:28.370
I don't think she's
a plain Jane at all.

01:03:28.372 --> 01:03:30.639
Anne? Anne's
a string bean, man.

01:03:30.641 --> 01:03:32.440
Come on, man,
she's pretty plain.

01:03:32.442 --> 01:03:34.042
You don't think
Anne is sexy, though?

01:03:34.044 --> 01:03:36.144
You know, I like a little
excitement in a woman, you know?

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:38.213
- Like what?
- I don't know, breasts.

01:03:38.215 --> 01:03:41.249
- I like a nice big fat lady, I'm not gonna lie.
<i>- Yeah, me too.</i>

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:43.852
Alright, well, fellas,
uh, I think I'm gonna split.

01:03:43.854 --> 01:03:45.253
So, good seeing you.

01:03:45.255 --> 01:03:46.555
Alright. It was good
seeing you too.

01:03:46.557 --> 01:03:47.823
See you later.
If you need us, just, uh

01:03:47.825 --> 01:03:49.257
you know, you have our phone
numbers, right?

01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:50.725
So you guys are just gonna
chill out here in the hall?

01:03:50.727 --> 01:03:52.360
<i>Yeah, we'll probably
chill out here.</i>

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:53.929
Okay. It's good
seeing you guys.

01:03:53.931 --> 01:03:54.963
- Good seeing you too, bro.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:03:54.965 --> 01:03:56.031
Always a pleasure.

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:57.098
<i>- Yeah.
- See ya.</i>

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.800
- Yeah.
- <i>"Mice and Men!"</i>

01:03:58.802 --> 01:04:01.503
- "Mice and Men." Alright. Yeah.
- <i>"Mice and Men!"</i>

01:04:01.505 --> 01:04:02.938
"Of Mice.."
"Of Mice and Men."

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:06.274
It's "Of Mice and Men."
It's "Of Mice and Men."

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:07.809
"Of Mice and Men."

01:04:07.811 --> 01:04:09.177
Almost doesn't make sense.

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:11.179

a good writer.

01:04:12.715 --> 01:04:14.783
Get it under all the way.

01:04:14.785 --> 01:04:17.385
- What, you don't think it..
- You don't know.

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:18.920
You don't think I put it
under there good enough?

01:04:18.922 --> 01:04:20.689
I don't know,
I think you half-assed it.

- Hi. I'm... I'm Max.
- Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:15.003

- Hi.

we're gonna go get something to eat.

- Oh, you're.. Let's get something to eat.
- Uh, at Fellini's.

01:06:28.618 --> 01:06:30.218
I'm... I'm really hungry.
She's hungry.

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.653
So we're gonna...
we're gonna hit it. So nice to see you.

01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:35.991
Ooh! What a great idea,
Beth. We'd love to join you.

01:06:35.993 --> 01:06:39.661
Uh... I don't... I don't...
I'm not so sure that they were..

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:41.062
Oh, were you excluding us?

01:06:41.064 --> 01:06:43.832
- No, you can come.
- What?

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:45.000
You can come.

01:06:45.002 --> 01:06:47.502
Oh, good. I didn't wanna
feel excluded.

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:48.737
That would feel bad.

01:06:48.739 --> 01:06:50.372
<i>Yeah, you don't
wanna feel excluded.</i>

01:06:50.374 --> 01:06:51.406
No, I don't.

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:55.844
Okay, so we'll all
go to dinner.

01:06:55.846 --> 01:06:58.246
Oh, good, that's nice.
I wanna go.

01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:00.015
- Yeah? Okay. Alright.
- Okay.

01:07:00.017 --> 01:07:02.617
- Just the way everyone likes to be invited. By saying..
- Yeah.

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:05.353
- ..."You can come."
- Oh, super!

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:08.757
- It's gonna be fun.
- Good? Alright.

01:07:16.832 --> 01:07:18.633
Sure. Thanks.

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:21.002
- Some wine?
- I'd love some, Max. Thank you.

01:07:21.004 --> 01:07:22.070
Say when.

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:32.814
- That's perfect. Thank you.
- Big girl pour.

01:07:32.816 --> 01:07:34.816
- Mm. "Big girl pour."
- Sure, thanks.

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:40.221
- Buddy?
- Yeah, just a normal amount.

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:42.223
<i>Don't be so judgmental.</i>

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:48.730
Cheers. Yay. Thank you.

01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:50.698
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:51.733
Cheers.

01:07:55.438 --> 01:07:57.338
Oh, this is so delish.

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:59.174
You should teach
a class on wine tasting.

01:07:59.176 --> 01:08:01.876
- Yeah?
- Or just knowing about wine.

01:08:01.878 --> 01:08:05.046
What would we call it?
Uh... wine to the Max.

01:08:05.048 --> 01:08:08.249
Yeah, I like that.
Why don't you write that down.

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:10.318
Oh, Max. Ooh.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.153
I like red wine too.

01:08:12.155 --> 01:08:13.555
That's interesting, Beth.

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:18.725
Is the wine going to
aggravate your IBS?

01:08:18.728 --> 01:08:20.261
Wine doesn't affect IBS.

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:23.765
- I didn't know you had IBS.
- Yup.

01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:25.966
<i>- We both do.
- Yeah, they both have IBS.</i>

01:08:25.969 --> 01:08:28.069
Take probiotics.

01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:29.270
I've heard that
that doesn't work.

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:31.840
- For real? No. It does.
- I bet it works.

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:32.941
Yeah.

01:08:32.943 --> 01:08:34.542
- I bet it works.
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:34.544 --> 01:08:37.245
Anne, I feel like maybe we
got off on the wrong foot...

01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:38.546
Beth, I'm sorry,
you're gonna have to speak up.

01:08:38.548 --> 01:08:39.581
<i>I feel like when we met,
maybe we...</i>

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:40.747
Mm.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.584
Maybe we got off
on the wrong foot.

01:08:42.586 --> 01:08:45.220
- Cool.
- So.

01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:48.288
You look really nice.
I'm not used to seeing you with

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:49.457
this much make-up on.

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:51.426
I'm so excited you approve
of my look.

01:08:51.428 --> 01:08:52.627
Yeah, you really went to town.

01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:54.496
I went to town.

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:56.798
Here's to stepping out
and here's to going to town.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.265
To clown town.

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:06.174
- My son Brian is, um...
- <i>Oh, God!</i>

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:10.377
Tell us another story,
that would be great.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.313
- He's playing the clarinet.
- <i>Um...</i>

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.883
- And, um...
<i>- I draw.</i>

01:09:14.885 --> 01:09:17.318
- You do?
- Yeah, yeah, it's sketches and stuff mostly.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:20.854
<i>- Yeah.
- Charcoals, pastel stuff.</i>

01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:22.657
You can draw me if you want.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:23.925
I would love to draw you.

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:25.393
- I would love to be drawn by you.
- Yeah.

01:09:25.395 --> 01:09:27.234
Hope you have enough pastels.

01:09:27.563 --> 01:09:29.796
- Oh, original.
- For the face.

01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:31.966
Original.

01:09:31.968 --> 01:09:33.734
Brian's been playing
klezmer music. He...

01:09:33.737 --> 01:09:36.604
Oh, God. Fucking Brian.

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:39.807
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay.

01:09:39.809 --> 01:09:41.676
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm with you.

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:44.179
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:52.987
<i>I'm having a blast.
I'm so glad we did this.</i>

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:54.221
When are we doing it again?

01:09:54.224 --> 01:09:55.290
Maybe we should get some food.

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:56.491
- Well, let's get some food.
- Yeah.

01:09:56.493 --> 01:09:57.559
- It's good idea.
- Let's get our food.

01:09:57.561 --> 01:09:58.660
Yeah.

01:11:15.238 --> 01:11:17.605
- You good? Yeah?
- I'm great.

01:11:28.717 --> 01:11:30.418
- You alright?
- Yeah.

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:35.302
I'd invite you in,
but I don't want to.

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:40.386
That's okay, because
I've kinda become afraid of you.

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:44.565
This you think I don't know.

01:11:44.567 --> 01:11:49.137
And you didn't give me dignity
or closure.

01:11:49.139 --> 01:11:50.605
And it's..

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:57.111
I wouldn't have said that
a month ago.

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:10.625
Hey, Jeff, it's Anne. I'm just
calling to talk to you, so..

01:12:10.627 --> 01:12:14.128
Give me a call back.
You know my number.

01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:18.433
Hey, Jeff, it's Anne. I was
just calling to... talk to you.

01:12:18.435 --> 01:12:23.738
Um, I feel like...
we never got, um

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:26.674
that side of eggplant
that we ordered and I was like

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.576
did we... did we pay for that?

01:12:28.578 --> 01:12:31.012
Hey, Jeff, I bet you're with
Beth right now.

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:33.314
I just wanted to say,
that's cool by me.

01:12:33.316 --> 01:12:36.284
'Cause guess who I'm with?
I'm with Brian.

01:12:36.286 --> 01:12:39.654
I... I have Brian with me,
and I know that he's, um

01:12:39.656 --> 01:12:41.155
allergic to peanuts.

01:12:41.157 --> 01:12:45.093
So I'm just... feeding him
a bunch of peanuts.

01:12:45.095 --> 01:12:49.297
Jeff! Hey, Jeffo!

01:12:49.299 --> 01:12:51.432
Would you call me back,
you stupid weirdo?

01:12:51.434 --> 01:12:52.567
Are you even getting these?

01:12:52.569 --> 01:12:54.168
Is this still your
fuckin' phone number?

01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:56.704
Jeff, what's up?

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:59.307
Jeff, I'm talking with my dog voice.
Call me back. Okay, babe.

01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:04.679
Oh my..
Oh! Hello?

01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:08.182
I'm sorry,
I thought I was actually...

01:13:08.184 --> 01:13:10.251
I meant to call my friend Jeff.

01:13:10.253 --> 01:13:12.854
He's been, um,
kinda dogging me.

01:13:13.856 --> 01:13:15.656
Give me a little phone call.

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:19.894
Call me up on the phone.

01:13:33.876 --> 01:13:36.511
Is this something
I'm gonna have to expect now?

01:13:36.513 --> 01:13:39.414
Yes! Why are you such
a fucking dick?

01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:41.783
- What?
- Why are you such a fucking di..

01:13:41.785 --> 01:13:44.752
<i>You're the one that's woken
me up two times this week</i>

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:46.754
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:49.090
- What is this fucking place?
- It's my apartment.

01:13:49.092 --> 01:13:52.226
Why do you.. You look like you live
in a fucking Pottery Barn commercial!

01:13:52.228 --> 01:13:53.528
Well, I ordered some stuff to

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:55.062
for the transition.

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:57.031
It looks like
a fucking catalogue!

01:13:57.033 --> 01:13:59.167
I'm trying to improve
my life like we talked about!

01:13:59.169 --> 01:14:01.636
What is your problem?

01:14:01.638 --> 01:14:04.238
I just feel like
I don't even know you.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.274
We agreed to do this
together, okay?

01:14:06.276 --> 01:14:08.843
And I feel like...
What was tonight?

01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:11.112
What? What... What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:12.647
Why were you
so weird at dinner?

01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:15.817
- I wasn't.. Why was I weird?
- Yeah?

01:14:15.819 --> 01:14:17.351
Why was I weird?
You were the weird one.

01:14:17.353 --> 01:14:19.287
Like I.. It's like we weren't
even ever friends.

01:14:19.289 --> 01:14:21.055
I feel like you're just
shutting me out.

01:14:21.057 --> 01:14:22.924
I mean, if... if you wanna
go out with Beth

01:14:22.926 --> 01:14:24.125
I don't fucking care.

01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:25.560
I don't wanna go out
with Beth.

01:14:25.562 --> 01:14:27.061
I'm just..

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:31.499
Why are you here?

01:14:33.869 --> 01:14:35.136
I don't know.

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:14.141
<i>Hi, Jeff, it's your mom.</i>

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:16.210
<i>Hi, Jeff, it's your mom.</i>

01:15:16.212 --> 01:15:19.780
<i>Hi, Jeff, it's your mom.
Hi, Jeff...</i>

01:15:19.782 --> 01:15:21.816
Fuck.

01:15:21.818 --> 01:15:24.151
Hi. Everything okay?

01:15:24.153 --> 01:15:25.553
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.623
Yeah.

01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:31.325
Mm. Mmm, my God.

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:37.331
I drank every bottle
of wine... in Pennsylvania.

01:15:37.333 --> 01:15:39.033
I ate all the meatballs.

01:15:46.008 --> 01:15:48.088
Is there water
on your side of the bed?

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:51.704
- No?
- There's water in the kitchen.

01:15:55.784 --> 01:15:57.652
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:02.156
Don't look at me like that.

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:05.059
Don't look at me.

01:16:06.996 --> 01:16:08.563
Mm.

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:12.600
Are...
Are we okay? We're cool?

01:16:12.602 --> 01:16:15.436
Yeah. What? Uh, yeah. Yeah.

01:16:15.438 --> 01:16:17.305
No, yeah, yeah...
It's okay.

01:16:17.307 --> 01:16:18.406
It's okay.
Yeah, we're okay.

01:16:18.408 --> 01:16:19.574
What are you talk..
Yeah.

01:16:19.576 --> 01:16:21.008
I just.. I don't know.
I never...

01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:23.544
Um, I'm not used
to, never have.

01:16:23.546 --> 01:16:25.913
Oh. Oh. Oh, yeah. Oops.

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:27.582
I hit one of them.
Um, we... we're good.

01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:29.850
We're so good. I, um..

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:35.690
Yeah, it's like, um..
What is that law?

01:16:35.692 --> 01:16:37.458
- Murphy's law.
- No, it's like, no.

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:40.094
It's... No, I hope
it was better.

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:42.563
Um, it's like a..
What is that thing?

01:16:42.565 --> 01:16:44.365
- Roe v. Wade?
- Yeah.. No!

01:16:45.567 --> 01:16:48.636
Oh, God. I hope it doesn't
end up, um, there.

01:16:48.638 --> 01:16:50.838
No, we used..

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:53.307
Yeah... we used protection.

01:16:53.309 --> 01:16:56.711
And.. No, I was just saying
that it's good to have

01:16:56.713 --> 01:16:58.346
a one night stand
with a friend.

01:16:58.348 --> 01:16:59.480
Cause it's not..
Then it's not..

01:16:59.482 --> 01:17:01.115
You know. It's kinda like..

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:03.284
You know, you know?

01:17:04.586 --> 01:17:07.788
Uh... cool?

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:09.724
Cool.

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:12.026
So maybe, maybe I should..

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:17.164
Yeah. Yeah. I have, um

01:17:17.166 --> 01:17:19.300
I have a ton of..

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.304
...stuffs.

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:24.739
Yeah.
Can you help me?

01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:26.173
- Mm?
- Can you help me with my bra?

01:17:26.175 --> 01:17:27.942
It's.. I don't..

01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:29.377
- Oh.
- I want to be..

01:17:29.379 --> 01:17:30.544
- Yeah.
- ...chaste. I..

01:17:30.546 --> 01:17:32.980
Yeah. Sorry.

01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:34.348
I will go as soon as...

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:37.184
No, no, no.
Whatever gets you out the door.

01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:39.887
- Okay.
- Okay, I'll leave. I'll leave.

01:17:39.889 --> 01:17:41.389
No, no, no, no.
I was kidding. Hold on.

01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:43.624
No. Get out.

01:17:43.626 --> 01:17:45.226
Do you want
all four clasps done?

01:17:45.228 --> 01:17:48.029
No, just one is fine,
'cause I'm not very big breasted.

01:17:48.031 --> 01:17:51.065
- Okay. There you go.
- Um, cool.

01:17:51.067 --> 01:17:54.268
Thank you.
That was fun.

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:56.303
It was weird.
It was fun.

01:17:56.305 --> 01:17:58.272
- That was weird, right?
- Yeah, it was weird.

01:17:58.274 --> 01:17:59.940
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:17:59.942 --> 01:18:02.610
I will never do..
I won't..

01:18:02.612 --> 01:18:04.311
Um..

01:18:05.647 --> 01:18:07.014
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:08.149
Goodbye.

01:18:09.418 --> 01:18:10.451
Yeah.

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:20.027
- It's so hard to take a good selfie these days.
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:22.630
I mean, it's more than just
the angle you know?

01:18:22.632 --> 01:18:24.298
You gotta think about lighting.

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.734
And I've been thinking about
getting some work done.

01:18:26.736 --> 01:18:28.736
I've noticed
in my profile picture

01:18:28.738 --> 01:18:30.337
that my chin looks

I saw him perch like
an owl on the back seat.

And then when I got in
the front seat there was a big

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:19.846
deuce in the back.

01:35:19.848 --> 01:35:22.048
Her parents are, um,
super-creative.

01:35:22.050 --> 01:35:24.217
That's why they gave her
the name Samanda.

They're both artists.
<i>What kind of art do they do?</i>

01:35:26.822 --> 01:35:28.655

No, they're artists.

01:35:31.293 --> 01:35:33.126
You have to be an artist
to make a beautiful rug.

01:35:33.128 --> 01:35:34.294
Sorry. You have to make..

01:35:43.738 --> 01:35:46.139

<i>Well, when you do that,
it just, it makes you look super..</i>

<i>No.</i>

Cool.

<i>- No.
- See?</i>

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:08.027
It just sounded like a
question but also a complaint.

01:36:08.029 --> 01:36:09.462
<i>Did it?</i>

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:16.703

01:36:18.073 --> 01:36:19.672
- Like gravel.
<i>- Okay, so you killed a woman.</i>

01:36:19.674 --> 01:36:22.876
No, I just know, because I've seen movies
and I've read books.

01:36:22.878 --> 01:36:25.078
<i>About killing women?
So you're interested in it.</i>

01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:27.046
No. I'm not.
I was forced to.

01:36:27.048 --> 01:36:29.282
<i>- Forced?
- I was forced to read books about killing women.</i>

01:36:29.284 --> 01:36:31.050
