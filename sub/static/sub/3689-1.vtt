<i>CJ ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS</i>

00:42.554 --> 00:45.125
<i>AN ANIMAL PLANET PRODUCTION
IN ASSOCIATION WITH CJ ENTERTAINMENT</i>

00:46.591 --> 00:49.094
<i>EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
JEONG TAE-SUNG</i>

01:45.850 --> 01:53.428
<i>JUNG WOO-SUNG</i>

02:01.799 --> 02:05.302
<i>LEE SOM</i>

02:05.303 --> 02:08.375
<i>These scentless petals covering</i>

02:10.008 --> 02:13.148
<i>the road endlessly make me forget</i>

02:15.113 --> 02:17.024
<i>why I decided to come here.</i>

02:31.196 --> 02:34.302
<i>When a ridiculous misunderstanding
forced me to leave the school</i>

02:35.300 --> 02:37.007
<i>I just wanted to hide</i>

02:37.735 --> 02:40.614
<i>where nobody could find me.</i>

02:43.541 --> 02:48.854
<i>I hoped to find something pure
that is vanishing from me,</i>

02:49.414 --> 02:52.554
<i>to prove myself writing a novel
with a new story I find there.</i>

03:04.996 --> 03:08.409
<i>But my strong intention faded
away as soon as I arrived.</i>

03:18.876 --> 03:21.413
<i>The old and weary mood this town held</i>

03:21.813 --> 03:23.417
<i>almost choked me.</i>

04:01.252 --> 04:02.754
<i>What is this kid?</i>

04:04.122 --> 04:06.159
<i>Never seen a man in a suit?</i>

04:30.815 --> 04:35.594
<i>She stared me with the inquisitive eyes.</i>

04:36.020 --> 04:37.556
<i>That's how I met her.</i>

04:45.797 --> 04:53.797
<i>DIRECTED BY
YIM PIL-SUNG</i>

05:03.815 --> 05:06.091
He's too young to be a professor.

05:06.951 --> 05:10.262
Guess he had a drink.
Look at his ruddy cheeks.

05:10.588 --> 05:12.255
You know the writer...

05:12.256 --> 05:16.227
needs a drink to talk
or write on something.

05:21.399 --> 05:25.506
<i>INTRODUCTION TO WRITING A NOVEL</i>

05:26.871 --> 05:29.909
- You want to write novels?
- Yes.

05:30.575 --> 05:32.646
You think anyone can write one?

05:34.445 --> 05:36.618
That's why we're here to learn.

05:37.014 --> 05:38.960
There's an expression
called literary youth.

05:39.050 --> 05:41.052
But no such thing like literary old.

05:41.252 --> 05:42.390
Do you know why?

05:42.754 --> 05:45.667
You are telling we old folks
don't deserve writing?

05:46.023 --> 05:48.264
Yes, the old can't write.

05:48.693 --> 05:51.264
They can only keep a diary.

05:52.230 --> 05:56.303
The old man with an old mind
only can write corny things.

05:57.135 --> 06:01.709
Only the one with an open
mind can do the literature.

06:01.839 --> 06:04.217
So if you want to write novels,

06:04.575 --> 06:07.920
you need to be young at heart again.

06:08.413 --> 06:10.017
You need to love!

06:10.615 --> 06:13.255
At our age? How?

06:13.618 --> 06:14.653
But it sounds good!

06:21.626 --> 06:24.573
- Hello.
- You're coming home now?

06:24.662 --> 06:28.405
- Tofu and zucchini, please.
- Sure.

06:33.204 --> 06:34.204
Mom!

06:36.407 --> 06:39.684
Just now. What do you want to get?

06:41.813 --> 06:42.883
Tofu and zucchini?

06:44.248 --> 06:46.785
I got them already. Let's go.

06:46.884 --> 06:49.421
Will make you delicious bean paste stew.

06:50.922 --> 06:55.132
You raised Deokee well.
So pretty and filial.

06:55.293 --> 06:56.738
You must be proud!

06:56.994 --> 06:58.769
- Good night.
- Good night.

07:06.904 --> 07:10.977
Mom, store owner told me

07:11.375 --> 07:13.946
this town will be redeveloped.

07:14.712 --> 07:18.489
So are we getting lots of compensation?

07:18.749 --> 07:21.457
Well... guess it would some.

07:21.719 --> 07:26.065
Much enough to move to Seoul?
What do you think?

07:26.190 --> 07:30.605
I hope the money is big
enough for your wedding.

07:30.928 --> 07:33.029
My wedding? No kidding!

07:33.030 --> 07:38.173
You should get married
when you meet a decent guy.

07:43.674 --> 07:47.451
If there is a decent guy,
I need to date him first.

07:47.812 --> 07:50.580
But problem is we can't
find a decent man here.

07:50.581 --> 07:54.150
The store owner will set
you up on a blind date.

07:54.151 --> 07:56.324
A guy working at a car company.

07:56.621 --> 07:58.066
A car company?

08:00.057 --> 08:01.057
Boring!

08:01.125 --> 08:04.129
You don't get married for fun!

08:05.463 --> 08:09.434
Are you worried about me?

08:10.601 --> 08:12.012
Don't worry.

08:12.837 --> 08:16.011
I won't live like this forever.

08:16.274 --> 08:18.686
I believe in you.

08:32.089 --> 08:34.034
The machine is too old.

08:34.457 --> 08:36.062
It needs some bashing once in a while.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.971
What do you want to ride?

08:45.336 --> 08:46.337
Pardon?

08:47.171 --> 08:49.913
The rides in this park. Which one?

08:51.676 --> 08:52.780
I didn't come for that.

08:54.645 --> 08:55.783
Are you working here?

08:57.481 --> 08:58.687
Right there.

09:01.285 --> 09:02.662
At the ticket office, I see.

09:05.957 --> 09:09.131
I've never seen a small
amusement park like this.

09:10.628 --> 09:14.303
They'll tear it down next year
and will build a public park.

09:15.299 --> 09:18.212
Nobody came to ride in full dress like you.

09:19.203 --> 09:20.648
I'm not here for the ride,

09:21.539 --> 09:23.644
but for the work. At the
lifelong education center.

09:23.841 --> 09:26.321
No one's dressed up there, either.

09:27.745 --> 09:28.746
I remember!

09:28.846 --> 09:30.689
You were in front of the store yesterday.

09:32.049 --> 09:33.494
So are you a professor?

09:34.385 --> 09:35.455
Yes.

09:35.987 --> 09:38.297
- Literature writing class.
- Wow.

09:39.256 --> 09:42.100
Thought that class would
be really interesting.

10:05.282 --> 10:10.391
She didn't get along with anyone,
and responded to no one.

10:12.990 --> 10:15.163
She simply existed there still and sound.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.236
As if she couldn't see

10:18.796 --> 10:23.745
or hear anything.

10:26.437 --> 10:30.510
She was cowering like a caterpillar

10:32.943 --> 10:37.483
waiting for the spring with
every fiber of her body.

10:38.382 --> 10:40.953
The time she would transform
into a beautiful being.

10:46.691 --> 10:49.137
As you are here, you should have a drink.

10:49.927 --> 10:51.194
Need to leave soon.

10:51.195 --> 10:54.608
Of course, you must be busy writing.

10:54.699 --> 10:59.648
But a drink could smooth your writing.

11:00.705 --> 11:03.807
- Just one glass!
- Then just one.

11:03.808 --> 11:05.344
There you go.

11:10.815 --> 11:14.319
Handsome ones look cool
even drinking monkey swill.

11:16.654 --> 11:19.726
- I'll pour you one.
- Thank you, professor.

11:25.396 --> 11:27.569
It's good!

11:28.799 --> 11:31.143
Deokee, I know you had a
blind date yesterday.

11:32.670 --> 11:35.276
- What?
- She did? With whom?

11:35.539 --> 11:37.985
The second son at the photo studio.

11:38.209 --> 11:39.882
He works at the motor factory.

11:39.977 --> 11:42.617
So you'll get married soon!

11:43.180 --> 11:44.420
No.

11:44.582 --> 11:46.118
Why not? That kid is okay.

11:46.217 --> 11:47.594
- Yes, he is.
- Right.

11:47.818 --> 11:52.995
- How many babies?
- You're so silly.

11:53.424 --> 11:57.566
She needs to square it with parents first.

11:58.028 --> 11:59.632
I'll get going.-

11:59.864 --> 12:02.632
- Why so early?
- We want to hear more.

12:02.633 --> 12:04.112
It wasn't fun at all.

12:05.402 --> 12:07.143
Tell us later!
Promise!

12:41.105 --> 12:42.550
Where's your house?

12:43.040 --> 12:44.041
Mine?

12:45.042 --> 12:51.118
The fifth house under the stairways.

12:56.887 --> 12:58.127
Mine is here.

12:59.323 --> 13:00.927
Guess you need to walk back.

13:01.559 --> 13:02.559
Yes...

13:04.461 --> 13:05.838
Good night.

13:07.965 --> 13:09.342
Hello, professor.

13:10.467 --> 13:15.075
- Kimchi stew and soju as usual?
- Yes.

14:15.132 --> 14:17.009
<i>Are you writing something?</i>

14:19.370 --> 14:21.504
<i>I'm so bored here, same old shits.</i>

14:21.505 --> 14:22.813
So what did the dean say?

14:23.574 --> 14:26.817
<i>He doesn't want to meet you.</i>

14:26.944 --> 14:27.979
Why?

14:28.312 --> 14:31.657
<i>He's being cautious as
it's a sensitive issue.</i>

14:31.949 --> 14:36.022
<i>Be patient. I'll try to persuade him.</i>

14:36.887 --> 14:41.768
<i>We're collecting evidences to prove
that you're falsely accused.</i>

14:42.326 --> 14:44.363
<i>Try to take it easy there.</i>

14:44.461 --> 14:47.203
<i>It'll take some time as
she's so persistent.</i>

14:48.666 --> 14:50.976
<i>You must feel depressed
in that backcountry.</i>

14:51.402 --> 14:55.179
<i>Find some hobby to spend time.</i>

14:56.273 --> 14:57.445
<i>Hang in there.</i>

15:32.543 --> 15:34.113
This place closes early.

15:36.313 --> 15:38.259
Yes, at 6 PM.

15:41.018 --> 15:43.225
Where are you going once it's demolished?

15:43.687 --> 15:44.893
Wherever.

15:45.322 --> 15:49.327
I'll be happy just escaping
from this boring town.

15:49.626 --> 15:51.266
Then you should try something not boring.

15:52.596 --> 15:53.973
Like what?

15:56.667 --> 15:59.409
Not the right one to ask.
I'm a boring person.

15:59.603 --> 16:02.015
You must be lonely not boring.

16:05.175 --> 16:06.677
Do I look lonely?

16:07.511 --> 16:10.390
I can tell as I see many people
coming here alone for a ride.

16:10.781 --> 16:14.024
The angry ones scream
riding on the pirate ship

16:14.351 --> 16:16.797
while lonely ones ride a merry-go-round.

16:17.321 --> 16:20.723
And the ones to be lost to the world

16:20.724 --> 16:22.135
get on the Ferris wheel.

16:23.494 --> 16:25.269
Then I should try all!

16:33.670 --> 16:35.809
Can I have a look at the bottle?

16:51.455 --> 16:52.593
It's... bitter!

16:55.325 --> 16:57.100
Guess you can't drink.

16:58.262 --> 17:01.004
Yes, I can.

17:15.079 --> 17:18.891
What brought you here, anyway?

17:21.585 --> 17:23.587
They say I did something wrong.

17:24.021 --> 17:28.196
I did nothing but I became the guilty one.

17:30.861 --> 17:36.209
I'll go buy things. Tend
the shop for me, Deokee.

17:38.902 --> 17:42.975
The bad things blindly
hit you like the lightening.

17:43.841 --> 17:48.449
My mother says we have to
take a shelter for a while

17:49.079 --> 17:51.025
until it clears up.

17:53.750 --> 17:55.787
Not the case for where I came from.

17:56.854 --> 18:01.633
It's a swamp boiling with the jealousy.

18:02.993 --> 18:06.702
If I waited like that,
I'd be bogged down deep.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.074
But thank you, Deokee.

18:14.338 --> 18:20.186
For listening to me
and believing what I said.

18:21.211 --> 18:22.781
Nobody did.

18:24.081 --> 18:27.790
It's my pleasure. I enjoy listening to you.

18:35.993 --> 18:39.497
When are you coming home?

18:43.934 --> 18:45.936
Can you come tonight?

18:46.503 --> 18:49.245
Daddy will be coming.

18:54.678 --> 18:56.680
Do you have to go to Seoul?

19:01.718 --> 19:03.823
You'd better get going, too.

19:06.890 --> 19:07.960
Yes.

19:15.966 --> 19:20.005
I might be in a trouble as
my wife hates me drinking.

19:20.938 --> 19:24.681
Then go tomorrow when you sober up.

19:26.376 --> 19:27.582
I'm leaving.

21:06.276 --> 21:07.448
So hot.

21:09.112 --> 21:10.591
It's so hot in here.

21:12.616 --> 21:14.493
Or is it me because of drinking?

21:21.491 --> 21:22.765
You're warm.

21:44.648 --> 21:48.061
Mom, tie my hair.

21:58.395 --> 22:00.329
Your dad is with a girl again.

22:00.330 --> 22:03.777
See he's not coming.

22:04.835 --> 22:07.008
He said he's coming today.

22:10.774 --> 22:15.519
Like father, like daughter.
You little liar.

22:27.057 --> 22:29.936
See you later, professor.

22:36.733 --> 22:37.803
Hello, sir.

22:39.469 --> 22:40.607
Hello.

22:44.574 --> 22:46.417
He's working too hard.

22:47.944 --> 22:51.983
He must be bored to sit still.

22:54.384 --> 22:57.194
I imagined it would be
quite scary at night here.

22:58.822 --> 23:00.130
Are you scared?

23:00.524 --> 23:03.596
Not at all. Because I'm with you.

23:30.487 --> 23:31.864
This is the switch.

23:32.189 --> 23:33.827
Are you sure about this?

24:08.124 --> 24:10.263
Let's stay this way for a while.

24:12.095 --> 24:13.165
Why?

24:14.197 --> 24:18.668
Just to remember this moment.

24:21.004 --> 24:24.042
It's my first date with a man I love.

26:14.050 --> 26:18.829
She comes in and out of
his house all the time.

26:19.155 --> 26:23.934
The guard at the park
told me he even saw them

26:25.996 --> 26:28.499
doing this! Shameless.

26:28.965 --> 26:34.608
We went wild and shameless
at our early days, too.

26:36.573 --> 26:41.545
As the old saying goes
it's always the quiet one.

26:43.380 --> 26:46.054
Oh my, she must've heard us!

26:46.182 --> 26:48.389
It's a nonsense. She's deaf anyway!

26:48.618 --> 26:51.687
- Deaf she is but gets what we say.
- It's okay.

26:51.688 --> 26:54.828
Don't know what to do. Oh my god.

26:56.893 --> 27:00.705
She must be really worried.

27:19.516 --> 27:20.551
What do you think?

27:30.894 --> 27:32.066
Do you like it?

27:35.165 --> 27:36.405
So pretty...

29:05.054 --> 29:08.092
Professor, when did you buy these?

29:44.327 --> 29:45.533
Try a walk?

33:10.833 --> 33:12.039
Professor!

33:55.445 --> 33:57.823
You like it?

33:58.981 --> 34:02.121
I like whatever you like.

34:34.784 --> 34:36.353
I'll never let you go.

34:37.786 --> 34:41.735
Never. Hear me?

35:29.005 --> 35:32.316
I like this phrase.

35:34.477 --> 35:37.754
Rustling sunlight falls like the fireworks

35:37.847 --> 35:40.589
glowing her hair all over.

35:46.088 --> 35:47.158
It tickles!

36:00.036 --> 36:03.017
I've never tasted coffee like this!

36:07.076 --> 36:08.419
So good!

36:21.190 --> 36:22.931
<i>ARRIVING IN 10 MINS
- DONG-WOO</i>

36:25.595 --> 36:27.370
What's up? Why didn't you call me ahead?

36:27.463 --> 36:31.138
<i>I wanted to deliver the good news myself.</i>

36:31.267 --> 36:34.248
Good news? I'll meet you at the terminal.

36:36.706 --> 36:38.413
My friend's coming. Need to go out.

36:38.708 --> 36:43.157
Bring him home. I'll prepare the dinner.

36:46.816 --> 36:49.854
Don't worry about it. He might leave soon.

37:00.596 --> 37:03.331
Thank you! How did you find that?

37:03.332 --> 37:08.372
A student came with the thing
she shot with her mobile.

37:09.071 --> 37:13.451
It had that bitch coming on to you.
All drunk!

37:13.709 --> 37:15.709
And she accused you of
sexual harassment? Bullshit!

37:16.078 --> 37:17.182
Thank you anyway.

37:17.280 --> 37:19.191
You'll be teaching from next semester

37:19.448 --> 37:21.587
as the disciplinary period is over.

37:22.385 --> 37:25.457
It must've been difficult for you.
I trusted you no matter what!

37:25.855 --> 37:28.995
- You're a true friend.
- Where's your place?

37:29.425 --> 37:31.426
Let me see how you live
and have lunch together.

37:31.427 --> 37:33.728
No need as I'm leaving soon.
Let me take you to the best in town.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.766
We need to drink! It's been a while.

37:35.831 --> 37:36.866
It sounds good.

37:52.982 --> 37:54.316
<i>I'LL BE LATE. GO HOME BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.</i>

37:54.317 --> 37:56.228
<i>LET'S TALK A LOT MORE TMR.
- PROFESSOR</i>

38:30.019 --> 38:32.295
What was the good news?

38:33.322 --> 38:34.892
I'm reinstated, Deokee.

38:38.394 --> 38:39.930
Congratulations.

38:45.768 --> 38:48.408
Where did I put my writing...

38:50.139 --> 38:51.209
Here it is!

38:52.641 --> 38:57.556
Deokee, can you check the
bus timetable for Seoul?

38:59.782 --> 39:03.628
It's time for lunch.
I'd like to have dumplings.

39:03.719 --> 39:05.960
I'll eat something on my way.

39:15.664 --> 39:17.268
I'm pregnant.

39:48.631 --> 39:51.771
<i>OBSTETRICS</i>

40:01.177 --> 40:04.954
Sorry, Deokee. For putting
you in this trouble.

40:10.586 --> 40:12.190
Will call you when I'm settled.

41:07.643 --> 41:10.715
<i>15 MISSED CALLS FROM MOM</i>

41:23.425 --> 41:24.768
Deokee!

41:26.128 --> 41:27.163
Deokee, wake up.

41:27.630 --> 41:28.870
Let's go home.

42:00.996 --> 42:02.498
Have you eaten?

42:03.299 --> 42:04.744
Like you care.

42:07.102 --> 42:08.240
The medicine?

42:08.671 --> 42:10.378
Excited to be back?

42:12.241 --> 42:13.345
Well... you know.

42:13.442 --> 42:16.753
Must be excited to flirt with
all those pretty college girls!

42:20.649 --> 42:23.596
You haven't slept again?
Take the medicine first.

42:49.311 --> 42:50.483
And time for bed.

42:52.448 --> 42:57.454
I know that you're a good person

42:59.722 --> 43:02.100
and I must not act like this.

43:04.326 --> 43:05.828
I'm...

43:09.231 --> 43:11.973
happy to have you back, too.

43:12.835 --> 43:14.041
I'll...

43:15.938 --> 43:17.417
try to get better.

43:52.141 --> 43:54.676
Stop! That's enough!

43:54.677 --> 43:56.452
Stop!

44:10.192 --> 44:14.462
- Please give some hints on the exam!
- Please go easy on us!

44:14.463 --> 44:15.567
Professor!

44:19.735 --> 44:21.840
Told you I'll be coming soon.

44:22.604 --> 44:24.777
You've been telling that
four times already.

44:29.611 --> 44:31.352
Let's meet outside later.

44:31.447 --> 44:33.654
Why didn't you tell your wife about us?

44:36.585 --> 44:41.864
Go home and wait for me.
I'll meet you there.

44:42.191 --> 44:43.636
No, you won't.

44:43.726 --> 44:44.966
I promise I will.

44:48.163 --> 44:49.642
You promise?

45:03.946 --> 45:04.947
What are you doing?

45:06.248 --> 45:07.348
What brings you here?

45:07.349 --> 45:09.920
Congratulations on the new project!

45:10.586 --> 45:16.002
The dean is so happy, he's
bragging about you all over.

45:16.825 --> 45:19.271
By the way, who was that girl?

45:21.296 --> 45:22.297
You saw her?

45:23.031 --> 45:26.706
- Remember you just came back.
- I know what I am doing.

45:27.402 --> 45:29.802
- If they catch you this time...
- I would like to ask you...

45:30.973 --> 45:32.919
to knock before you come in.

46:17.052 --> 46:18.656
I knew you'd be coming.

46:19.855 --> 46:20.925
Deokee.

46:21.824 --> 46:23.064
Yes?

46:31.900 --> 46:33.402
What is this?

46:35.103 --> 46:36.707
Don't wait for me.

46:42.778 --> 46:46.885
Why can't I?

46:47.583 --> 46:49.153
Just don't.

46:53.722 --> 46:55.326
You're afraid the school will find out

46:56.859 --> 46:59.160
about an affair and the abortion?

46:59.161 --> 47:00.697
Calm down and be quiet.

47:03.398 --> 47:05.400
I did everything you told me to.

47:06.468 --> 47:08.778
Keep waiting.

47:09.371 --> 47:11.783
And now you want me to shut up?

47:12.474 --> 47:13.714
Why should I?

47:13.775 --> 47:16.153
If you can't, I can do it for you.

47:17.079 --> 47:18.786
Talk to the school

47:19.014 --> 47:20.755
and to your wife.

47:22.718 --> 47:25.631
- Who knows if I already did?
- Listen.

47:26.922 --> 47:28.492
Let's end it here.

47:28.557 --> 47:30.730
Don't wanna hurt you anymore.

47:30.826 --> 47:33.670
I cannot be the one you want.
You know that.

47:35.063 --> 47:36.440
Professor.

47:38.967 --> 47:40.810
I love you.

47:43.939 --> 47:45.213
I love you so much.

47:45.274 --> 47:46.440
Kiss me please.

47:46.441 --> 47:47.818
Please stop.

47:47.910 --> 47:48.945
Don't!

48:13.068 --> 48:14.638
What's with you, Chungee?

48:17.039 --> 48:18.143
What?

48:19.408 --> 48:23.948
Stop crying and stay still.
I'll be right there.

48:24.046 --> 48:26.890
Mom! Mom!

48:27.215 --> 48:29.456
Deokee, come back!

48:30.886 --> 48:32.126
It's dangerous!

48:32.454 --> 48:33.454
Deokee!

48:44.733 --> 48:45.871
Deokee!

48:50.806 --> 48:52.114
<i>It's 911 .</i>

48:52.975 --> 48:56.149
<i>Hello?</i>

48:57.713 --> 49:00.319
Mom! Mom!

49:18.967 --> 49:21.607
What shall we do? Poor Deokee!

49:21.770 --> 49:24.910
Somebody help here!

49:25.307 --> 49:26.407
Please help here!

49:26.408 --> 49:28.786
- Are there people inside?
- Yes! Please hurry!

49:49.097 --> 49:50.508
Dad...

49:55.170 --> 49:58.845
Mom's still inside the room?

50:15.524 --> 50:16.764
Ma...

50:34.276 --> 50:38.156
<i>On that day, the big wave</i>

50:38.313 --> 50:41.055
<i>completely swept away our lives.</i>

50:59.367 --> 51:03.816
So the text can contain several meanings...

51:04.506 --> 51:08.613
which can be changed
upon the interpretation.

51:09.044 --> 51:10.887
For example, the characters of Chun-hyang

51:11.680 --> 51:13.717
in Pansori 'Chun-hyang',

51:14.182 --> 51:16.184
in 'Flower in the Jail',
the modern novel version,

51:16.618 --> 51:19.724
and in the film version, 'Chunhyang'.

51:22.457 --> 51:24.300
Are different from one to another.

51:24.459 --> 51:30.876
<i>The last piece of purity inside me
was burn to ashes with them.</i>

51:31.199 --> 51:34.646
- So the text can contain...
- You said it already.

51:37.706 --> 51:45.147
<i>After that day, everything
seem blurred to me.</i>

51:47.082 --> 51:50.791
<i>8 YEARS LATER</i>

51:53.155 --> 51:55.328
Do you expect this one
to be another bestseller?

51:59.728 --> 52:02.834
<i>But ironically my books became
the bestsellers one after another.</i>

52:03.365 --> 52:08.041
<i>And I lived life hard and wild
to escape from the past.</i>

52:26.721 --> 52:28.029
Damn it.

53:13.602 --> 53:14.876
Professor!

54:26.908 --> 54:28.114
Professor!

54:28.910 --> 54:31.720
Who are you going with
to the conference in Tokyo?

54:34.015 --> 54:35.426
Why do you care?

54:38.687 --> 54:40.360
Can I come along?

54:40.488 --> 54:42.593
Wanna date with you in Shibuya.

54:42.991 --> 54:44.231
It would be romantic.

54:44.326 --> 54:47.466
Do we need to go to Shibuya to be romantic?

54:48.330 --> 54:50.970
What about your thesis and TV show?

54:51.066 --> 54:52.739
You don't have to worry about it.

54:54.569 --> 55:00.611
Told you that our love can only
be completed in the closed room.

55:01.309 --> 55:04.654
You want people to gossip
when they see us together?

55:06.348 --> 55:08.555
Embarrassed to be seen with me?

55:09.751 --> 55:11.890
Think of this place as outside.

55:13.388 --> 55:16.457
It's a nonsense! Since I met you...

55:16.458 --> 55:20.270
It's outside. Outside
of your house and mine.

55:20.362 --> 55:23.935
Just change your way of thinking.
Not that difficult.

56:00.668 --> 56:05.481
<i>For the youth, dream can be the love...</i>

56:05.573 --> 56:07.575
<i>that sweeps you away.</i>

56:10.779 --> 56:11.779
I'm going out.

56:13.314 --> 56:14.452
Going where?

56:20.722 --> 56:22.133
To see a sis next door.

56:28.263 --> 56:30.072
What did you do to your lips?

56:32.300 --> 56:34.234
<i>My only concern was my daughter, Chungee.</i>

56:34.235 --> 56:37.438
<i>We should search for a job
as we do for pure first love.</i>

56:37.439 --> 56:39.214
<i>Well, I guess so.</i>

56:40.875 --> 56:44.755
<i>Then the fearsome price of my lust</i>

56:45.046 --> 56:46.582
<i>knocked at the door.</i>

56:49.818 --> 56:53.322
It is blurry in the center and
everything goes out of focus.

57:00.361 --> 57:01.965
You've got retinal macular degeneration.

57:02.730 --> 57:03.730
What's that?

57:03.798 --> 57:07.336
A problem at macular inside your retina

57:07.469 --> 57:09.506
causes the failing vision.

57:09.838 --> 57:11.977
You have diabetes.

57:12.106 --> 57:14.108
But you keep drinking and smoking

57:14.409 --> 57:16.753
as well as writing which
stresses the sight.

57:16.845 --> 57:19.325
I think you've developed the complication.

57:20.915 --> 57:23.088
But I can get better with
some treatment, can't I?

57:23.318 --> 57:29.462
I'm afraid there's no perfect cure yet.

57:32.827 --> 57:35.740
You're telling me

57:37.465 --> 57:39.570
I could lose my eyesight completely?

57:39.667 --> 57:41.374
In the worst case scenario, yes.

57:41.703 --> 57:44.809
But we can at least delay the progress.

57:45.006 --> 57:46.610
Be sure to take diabetes medicine.

57:46.808 --> 57:49.109
And no excessive exercise.

57:49.110 --> 57:50.851
Also absolutely no alcohol and cigarettes!

57:57.385 --> 57:58.887
How about sex?

58:00.755 --> 58:01.756
Pardon?

58:03.358 --> 58:07.670
I heard you visit the luxurious
villa in Gangnam regularly.

58:08.596 --> 58:09.666
Pardon?

58:10.465 --> 58:13.878
The rumor says
it's an illegal gambling place.

58:18.706 --> 58:24.987
I heard some public figures were
involved in Group K's slush fund.

58:25.713 --> 58:28.387
I know you went to college with
Lee, the CEO of Group K.

58:29.584 --> 58:34.932
We won't make a fuss as it can
ruin school's reputation.

58:35.123 --> 58:36.123
Mr. Dean.

58:36.157 --> 58:40.663
I feel bad doing this as you're
the face of our faculty.

58:40.762 --> 58:43.003
You'll get the leave allowance right away.

58:43.097 --> 58:44.405
All gone?

58:44.499 --> 58:47.668
I can't believe how this
bastard could be CEO

58:47.669 --> 58:50.775
being so clumsy handling the work.

58:53.141 --> 58:56.643
You know how much I bet for that?

58:56.644 --> 58:59.022
My new car is gone too!

58:59.080 --> 59:02.061
- At least you have a bestselling book...
- Shut up!

59:03.418 --> 59:06.399
I put all my 3 year advance
and down payment!

59:38.786 --> 59:41.960
<i>Chungee always strayed and
didn't care about me at all.</i>

59:43.725 --> 59:46.171
<i>She seemed to desperately</i>

59:47.395 --> 59:49.739
<i>search for someone to rely on
even for a short moment.</i>

59:58.539 --> 01:00:00.519
<i>SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT</i>

01:00:00.608 --> 01:00:02.679
<i>PROVISIONAL ATTACHMENT ON IMMOVABLES</i>

01:00:17.725 --> 01:00:19.432
Notice of seizure? What is it?

01:00:21.362 --> 01:00:23.865
Nothing. Mind your own business.

01:00:45.353 --> 01:00:47.856
- You're living next door?
- Yes.

01:00:49.791 --> 01:00:52.169
I guess Chungee's not home.

01:00:53.161 --> 01:00:54.538
Brought some pancakes for her.

01:00:56.264 --> 01:00:58.039
She's at school now.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.243
You don't like the pancakes?

01:01:12.747 --> 01:01:15.091
You must be Professor Shim.

01:01:16.918 --> 01:01:18.920
I've heard from Chungee

01:01:19.654 --> 01:01:22.225
that your visions are failing lately.

01:01:23.324 --> 01:01:25.065
Guess you're close to my daughter.

01:01:26.027 --> 01:01:29.270
Yes, we got along very easily.

01:01:32.767 --> 01:01:36.146
Rustling sunlight falls like the fireworks

01:01:36.504 --> 01:01:39.041
glowing her hair all over.

01:01:39.841 --> 01:01:41.582
I like this novel.

01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:44.284
You do?

01:01:46.881 --> 01:01:50.852
Professor, treat me as a fan of your work.

01:01:51.185 --> 01:01:55.565
You can be at ease with me.

01:01:57.792 --> 01:02:01.467
My name is Se-Jung. Yoon Se-Jung.

01:02:03.331 --> 01:02:06.437
Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Yoon Se-Jung.

01:02:11.572 --> 01:02:16.214
How's your father lately?
He seemed quite lonely.

01:02:17.545 --> 01:02:22.358
He's a lonely man with a failing vision.

01:02:24.452 --> 01:02:26.125
But I hate him.

01:02:27.488 --> 01:02:31.334
You should not. He's your father anyway.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.865
I typed his writing yesterday.

01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:37.203
You did what? Why?

01:02:38.599 --> 01:02:40.806
I like his novels a lot.

01:02:42.103 --> 01:02:44.049
Can I help him writing?

01:02:45.673 --> 01:02:47.880
Then can I go to see you every day?

01:02:57.919 --> 01:02:58.920
What is it?

01:02:59.854 --> 01:03:01.800
I can't read your handwriting.

01:03:04.759 --> 01:03:05.999
Which part?

01:03:06.861 --> 01:03:09.899
What would it feel like
if the whole world disappears?

01:03:10.164 --> 01:03:11.268
And then?

01:03:13.534 --> 01:03:15.480
What did I write?

01:03:19.507 --> 01:03:23.512
How is your sight lately?

01:03:25.079 --> 01:03:29.289
It got worse than when I
first saw you, right?

01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:30.993
Think so, but can't tell exactly

01:03:32.653 --> 01:03:34.724
as I haven't been to the hospital lately.

01:03:35.122 --> 01:03:37.568
Things were just out of focus before...

01:03:38.693 --> 01:03:42.539
but everything became blurry at some point.

01:03:45.533 --> 01:03:49.140
The glasses don't help actually.

01:03:50.171 --> 01:03:54.711
Let's see an eye doctor with me.
I know a good one.

01:03:55.142 --> 01:03:56.382
Come with me.

01:03:57.211 --> 01:04:01.887
I really hope your eyes get better

01:04:03.251 --> 01:04:05.527
so that you can write again.

01:04:07.622 --> 01:04:09.761
The handwriting's bad,

01:04:11.158 --> 01:04:14.332
but your recent writings are powerful.

01:04:20.268 --> 01:04:22.839
It won't be easy but can be cured.

01:04:22.904 --> 01:04:24.008
Really?

01:04:24.605 --> 01:04:27.085
There's a cutting-edge
treatment from England.

01:04:27.174 --> 01:04:30.747
We'll perform medication
for a month then surgery.

01:04:31.545 --> 01:04:35.857
The chances are not high
but it's worth to try.

01:04:36.317 --> 01:04:37.762
Thank you so much.

01:05:09.183 --> 01:05:10.662
Happy birthday, Chungee.

01:05:11.152 --> 01:05:13.291
Make a wish!

01:05:15.089 --> 01:05:17.091
I can see you are pulling
a long face again.

01:05:21.195 --> 01:05:22.230
Professor.

01:05:23.364 --> 01:05:25.571
You should see the doctor tomorrow.

01:05:26.534 --> 01:05:29.140
- I'll go with you.
- Thanks.

01:05:33.007 --> 01:05:34.418
It's time for your medicine.

01:06:07.708 --> 01:06:08.812
How do you feel?

01:06:10.211 --> 01:06:12.445
I could see the shapes
even though it's blurry

01:06:12.446 --> 01:06:14.687
with my left eye before.

01:06:15.282 --> 01:06:18.820
But now the dim contour only...

01:06:19.086 --> 01:06:20.086
Wait a second.

01:06:22.523 --> 01:06:23.695
How about now?

01:06:25.159 --> 01:06:27.469
I only see the black-ringed contour.

01:06:27.995 --> 01:06:29.406
It's all faint.

01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:33.177
It's a routine reaction
to the medication treatment.

01:06:33.601 --> 01:06:37.014
We can now move on
to the next step.

01:06:38.039 --> 01:06:39.609
You mean the operation?

01:06:43.177 --> 01:06:43.985
Yes.

01:06:44.045 --> 01:06:47.754
You'll see the whole bright world soon.

01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:49.657
Thank you.

01:06:50.785 --> 01:06:52.958
But how much does it cost?

01:06:53.788 --> 01:06:58.396
Will discuss it with your guardian.

01:07:05.232 --> 01:07:07.508
Why don't you tell me the cost?
Is it that big?

01:07:07.735 --> 01:07:09.840
Let me find a way.

01:07:10.371 --> 01:07:14.251
You've spent most of money
to stop the foreclosure.

01:07:14.875 --> 01:07:16.047
Se-Jung!

01:07:16.844 --> 01:07:18.323
Let's go to the gambling house.

01:07:21.082 --> 01:07:22.959
I need to relieve the stress.

01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:27.897
So please do as I ask. Now!

01:07:28.889 --> 01:07:30.232
I still got money.

01:07:30.558 --> 01:07:34.005
As you wish.

01:08:06.927 --> 01:08:10.101
- Diamond K, raise anyone?
- Raise one thousand.

01:08:10.164 --> 01:08:11.165
Raise one thousand.

01:08:13.134 --> 01:08:14.033
Fold.

01:08:14.034 --> 01:08:14.934
Go one thousand.

01:08:14.935 --> 01:08:17.142
One thousand received and one more, fold?

01:08:18.171 --> 01:08:21.448
- Fold. One thousand.
- Call.

01:08:21.908 --> 01:08:24.617
Call received. Will open the river.

01:08:25.546 --> 01:08:28.652
- Diamond 6. Raise?
- Raise one thousand!

01:08:28.782 --> 01:08:29.817
Raise one thousand.

01:08:30.417 --> 01:08:31.417
Raise one thousand.

01:08:31.752 --> 01:08:35.598
- Re-raise by 5 thousand.
- Re-raise, 5 thousand.

01:08:35.788 --> 01:08:37.291
Call for 5 thousand?

01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:41.167
- Call!
- Call it is.

01:08:41.694 --> 01:08:42.969
Will open the cards.

01:08:44.932 --> 01:08:46.639
Luck is coming my way today.

01:08:59.479 --> 01:09:01.323
The room upstairs isn't open yet?

01:09:11.492 --> 01:09:12.630
<i>Se-Jung!</i>

01:09:14.228 --> 01:09:15.228
<i>Yes.</i>

01:09:16.897 --> 01:09:19.377
<i>I think I can do anything today.</i>

01:09:20.267 --> 01:09:23.680
<i>I can earn the money for
the operation at one shot.</i>

01:09:23.837 --> 01:09:26.215
<i>It will be tens of thousand at most, right?</i>

01:09:27.041 --> 01:09:30.578
<i>You should go all the way
on a day like today.</i>

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:36.393
<i>All right, professor.
Let's go crazy tonight.</i>

01:10:05.279 --> 01:10:06.587
<i>Open the cards.</i>

01:10:30.604 --> 01:10:32.606
- Ten thousand.
- Call.

01:10:35.109 --> 01:10:36.281
Call for ten thousand.

01:10:36.844 --> 01:10:37.844
Fold.

01:10:40.781 --> 01:10:42.658
- Re-raise by 20 thousand.
- 20 thousand

01:10:44.318 --> 01:10:45.318
Fold!

01:10:45.386 --> 01:10:46.490
Call for 20 thousand?

01:10:47.655 --> 01:10:48.655
Call!

01:10:54.161 --> 01:10:55.765
- 20 thousand!
- 20 thousand it is.

01:10:55.829 --> 01:10:57.866
I'll take a call and put all in.

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:02.909
- Call.
- Call taken. Will open the cards.

01:11:17.484 --> 01:11:20.294
- Call the banker.
- Please stop.

01:11:20.821 --> 01:11:22.960
I should get my money back.

01:11:23.691 --> 01:11:25.136
Where's the banker?

01:11:29.063 --> 01:11:30.330
<i>BOND OF DEBT</i>

01:11:30.331 --> 01:11:32.031
<i>AMOUNT: $90,000 AT MONTHLY RATE OF 45%</i>

01:11:32.032 --> 01:11:34.308
<i>DEBTOR: SHIM HAK-KYU
DUE: SEPT. 30, 2014</i>

01:12:03.464 --> 01:12:04.738
Have some pancakes.

01:12:15.142 --> 01:12:16.382
Is it good?

01:12:21.548 --> 01:12:23.118
- Se-Jung.
- Yes?

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.222
You remind me of my mom.

01:12:30.557 --> 01:12:35.302
She was pretty but wrecked.

01:12:37.698 --> 01:12:40.440
She stayed in bed all day
'cause of depression.

01:12:42.269 --> 01:12:44.613
It wasn't just her fault, though.

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:51.815
I guess you are what a mom should be.

01:12:53.547 --> 01:12:56.528
Sweet and tender.

01:12:58.519 --> 01:12:59.691
But!

01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:04.870
I don't want you to be my mom.

01:13:07.895 --> 01:13:11.536
Are you going to marry my dad?

01:13:16.637 --> 01:13:21.177
No, I am not.

01:13:25.479 --> 01:13:28.016
- What should I do?
- About what?

01:13:29.183 --> 01:13:30.560
The money.

01:13:32.586 --> 01:13:35.863
I could do anything if I can see things.

01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:37.860
I really want to see you, too.

01:13:42.563 --> 01:13:45.998
I can't imagine how terrible it must be

01:13:45.999 --> 01:13:48.240
if I were blind like you.

01:13:49.703 --> 01:13:54.277
But you don't have to worry.
You've got me and Chungee.

01:13:58.078 --> 01:14:03.084
Give me some time.

01:14:10.224 --> 01:14:12.261
I will find away.

01:14:28.509 --> 01:14:29.544
Where's Chungee?

01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:32.017
She went to bed a while ago.

01:15:16.356 --> 01:15:17.357
Who's that?

01:15:18.959 --> 01:15:20.165
Is it Chungee?

01:15:22.429 --> 01:15:23.703
It was her, right?

01:15:23.764 --> 01:15:25.141
She saw us, did she?

01:15:29.536 --> 01:15:30.776
It should be okay.

01:15:31.772 --> 01:15:35.720
She'll understand if I tell her
we're going to get married.

01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:38.412
Of course, she will.

01:15:39.646 --> 01:15:41.592
How can't she?

01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:44.588
She's daddy's little girl.

01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:54.261
Who is it?

01:15:55.128 --> 01:15:56.664
It's banker Choi, professor.

01:15:57.764 --> 01:15:59.573
I'll come in for a bit.

01:16:03.837 --> 01:16:07.341
Your debt with a huge interest...

01:16:08.842 --> 01:16:10.219
What should we do?

01:16:10.477 --> 01:16:14.823
I can pay you back.
Just let me in some high games.

01:16:16.116 --> 01:16:21.657
Nonsense to pay your debt
by winning money gambling!

01:16:26.326 --> 01:16:28.067
You must be Chungee. Back from school?

01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:33.304
I'm your daddy's buddy.
Don't be so guarded.

01:16:34.701 --> 01:16:36.647
You're much prettier in person.

01:16:36.737 --> 01:16:38.341
Go to your room.

01:16:42.042 --> 01:16:43.612
We should go, too.

01:16:44.411 --> 01:16:45.611
As the little one's back home.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.452
How old are you?

01:16:50.817 --> 01:16:52.057
I will see you around.

01:17:08.001 --> 01:17:09.674
Can't believe this!

01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:10.771
What?

01:17:12.472 --> 01:17:13.780
What is it?

01:17:18.145 --> 01:17:22.389
I'm so scared. I can't even go home.

01:17:23.917 --> 01:17:26.693
He's coming to our house every day.

01:17:27.587 --> 01:17:29.225
It's driving me crazy.

01:17:31.892 --> 01:17:33.894
<i>Me and clad, what should we do?</i>

01:17:34.194 --> 01:17:36.902
<i>I would feel safer. If you married him.</i>

01:17:38.665 --> 01:17:43.205
<i>Don't worry too much. Let
me take care of this.</i>

01:18:00.854 --> 01:18:04.631
What are you guys doing?

01:18:04.725 --> 01:18:07.593
You ruthless bastards.

01:18:07.594 --> 01:18:11.474
Are you okay, professor?

01:18:11.865 --> 01:18:14.345
What's all this about?

01:18:14.401 --> 01:18:17.473
I apologize, sir. Let him seated.

01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:24.689
My apology. They were so rude.

01:18:25.011 --> 01:18:27.184
What the hell were you doing?

01:18:27.881 --> 01:18:30.122
I'm really sorry.

01:18:30.917 --> 01:18:37.698
I have an idea to end all your troubles.

01:18:39.126 --> 01:18:41.606
Let's send Chungee to Japan.

01:18:44.231 --> 01:18:46.211
What're you talking about?

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.135
No way.

01:18:49.035 --> 01:18:51.704
I will protect her whatever it takes.

01:18:51.705 --> 01:18:53.707
Let me finish first!

01:18:54.341 --> 01:18:56.378
Listen carefully.

01:18:56.610 --> 01:18:58.453
Consider it as the overseas training.

01:18:58.578 --> 01:19:00.683
All she needs to do is to talk
with the high-class clients.

01:19:00.781 --> 01:19:03.022
It could be a chance for her.

01:19:03.150 --> 01:19:06.256
Why don't you just kill me
and sell my corpse?

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.124
It could make you some money.

01:19:08.221 --> 01:19:13.830
What is the use of dying?
Want to make a child an orphan?

01:19:14.127 --> 01:19:18.974
If you agree with my plan,
I can pay for your surgery.

01:19:20.567 --> 01:19:23.912
I can write novels.

01:19:24.004 --> 01:19:25.711
I'm a bestselling writer.

01:19:25.806 --> 01:19:31.813
- Let me write a book for you.
- Whatever. Hold him!

01:19:31.912 --> 01:19:34.017
Please don't do this!

01:19:34.114 --> 01:19:37.118
You should cure your eyes first

01:19:37.384 --> 01:19:40.024
to bring your daughter back

01:19:40.287 --> 01:19:43.791
and see your pretty chick's face.
Ain't it right?

01:19:46.793 --> 01:19:47.794
I got it!

01:19:48.161 --> 01:19:50.141
Son of a bitch!

01:19:50.497 --> 01:19:52.704
Why make things complicated
by resisting in vain?

01:19:53.166 --> 01:19:56.704
Take him home.

01:19:58.271 --> 01:20:00.342
Don't forget the money, sir.

01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:04.483
I will make you pay for it
when I have my sight back!

01:20:08.081 --> 01:20:10.493
Thanks to my money, you motherfucker!

01:20:28.835 --> 01:20:30.246
What happened to your face?

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:35.317
Let me have the surgery with this money.

01:20:38.144 --> 01:20:40.215
What the heck did you do?

01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:42.691
This is way far from enough.

01:20:45.118 --> 01:20:47.064
I even released my bar for you.

01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:57.269
What are you talking about?

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:01.277
Where's Chungee?

01:21:02.135 --> 01:21:04.240
Where's my girl?

01:21:05.071 --> 01:21:07.950
Chungee! My daughter!

01:21:16.783 --> 01:21:20.094
My poor little girl...

01:21:22.989 --> 01:21:24.093
Chungee...

01:21:47.647 --> 01:21:48.921
Chungee...

01:22:16.343 --> 01:22:17.583
Are you awake?

01:22:18.211 --> 01:22:20.418
You'd better behave.

01:22:22.449 --> 01:22:23.757
You know what it is?

01:22:24.551 --> 01:22:28.931
It's a memo that your daddy
sold you for money.

01:22:30.256 --> 01:22:32.236
You bastard must've threatened him!

01:22:32.325 --> 01:22:34.566
Watch your language.

01:22:35.028 --> 01:22:36.939
Didn't threaten anybody.

01:22:37.764 --> 01:22:41.576
He signed for the money
to open his eyes again.

01:22:41.935 --> 01:22:43.812
It's a bullshit, scumbag!

01:22:44.204 --> 01:22:46.309
Watch your mouth, I warned you.

01:22:47.707 --> 01:22:50.210
Of course, it took him a while.
He's the father after all.

01:22:54.581 --> 01:22:55.889
How about Se-Jung?

01:22:56.216 --> 01:22:58.196
How did you find me there?

01:22:58.518 --> 01:22:59.519
You mean Deokee?

01:23:01.588 --> 01:23:05.092
You naive little girl...

01:23:05.892 --> 01:23:09.465
Didn't you get suspicious at all

01:23:09.696 --> 01:23:13.872
when the new neighbor treated you too kind?

01:23:34.554 --> 01:23:36.591
I'm pretty excited.

01:23:40.827 --> 01:23:43.603
<i>6 MONTHS LATER</i>

01:25:07.881 --> 01:25:09.883
I made your favorite. Kimchi stew.

01:25:37.977 --> 01:25:40.890
You got a problem with my cooking?

01:25:41.681 --> 01:25:43.183
It tastes weird.

01:25:43.316 --> 01:25:45.694
You think I'll give you things not eatable?

01:25:46.986 --> 01:25:49.398
I'm working my hard ass off

01:25:50.857 --> 01:25:52.803
to take care of you.

01:25:54.561 --> 01:25:56.268
Be at least grateful.

01:25:59.098 --> 01:26:02.875
I know, I know. My bad.

01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:06.776
Let's not argue. Please help
me wash myself instead.

01:26:21.287 --> 01:26:23.392
Got any news about Chungee?

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:31.433
I had a baby.

01:26:32.198 --> 01:26:33.199
What?

01:26:35.501 --> 01:26:37.447
Where's your baby now?

01:26:40.306 --> 01:26:41.614
Dead.

01:26:43.776 --> 01:26:48.054
Because of its dad.

01:26:51.484 --> 01:26:54.431
I was just an innocent girl

01:26:56.723 --> 01:26:59.829
working at the small
amusement park.

01:27:00.627 --> 01:27:02.629
I knew nothing about the world.

01:27:09.135 --> 01:27:14.778
- My mom couldn't speak,
- Mom, do you love me?

01:27:15.541 --> 01:27:18.078
- But loved me dearly.
- I love you, too.

01:27:22.782 --> 01:27:24.921
That son of a bitch ruined everything!

01:27:26.486 --> 01:27:31.196
That bastard killed my
unborn baby and my mom.

01:27:34.994 --> 01:27:36.405
Do you get it?

01:27:38.931 --> 01:27:40.808
You ruined everything!

01:27:42.035 --> 01:27:44.606
You destroyed my life, motherfucker!

01:27:48.441 --> 01:27:49.442
So

01:27:50.209 --> 01:27:51.415
It was you.

01:27:52.645 --> 01:27:55.216
I suspected...

01:27:57.884 --> 01:28:00.330
but wish it were never you.

01:28:05.758 --> 01:28:08.534
I went totally wrecked,

01:28:09.996 --> 01:28:12.602
but did whatever it took to survive.

01:28:14.867 --> 01:28:18.405
I swore that I'll make you
go through all the same.

01:28:19.839 --> 01:28:22.376
My resolution grew weaker,

01:28:23.376 --> 01:28:25.117
but then I saw you.

01:28:26.479 --> 01:28:30.928
You didn't change a bit.
Still same selfish bastard!

01:28:32.185 --> 01:28:33.220
Do you know?

01:28:34.153 --> 01:28:35.188
You understand?

01:28:35.755 --> 01:28:36.756
You know that?

01:28:36.856 --> 01:28:39.530
How selfish you're? You know that?

01:28:48.634 --> 01:28:51.137
You're satisfied now?

01:29:01.981 --> 01:29:05.519
Your daughter is dead.
Couldn't even find the body.

01:29:05.985 --> 01:29:07.430
You caused it to yourself.

01:30:50.890 --> 01:30:51.925
Deokee.

01:31:51.684 --> 01:31:53.561
He can never see again

01:31:54.554 --> 01:31:56.500
unless he gets the transplant.

01:33:00.152 --> 01:33:03.258
<i>My body and soul were
completely ravaged already.</i>

01:33:05.358 --> 01:33:07.565
<i>So I couldn't even feel the pain.</i>

01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:15.176
<i>But I wished she would stay
even if it's only to celebrate</i>

01:33:17.370 --> 01:33:19.611
<i>the fulfillment of her revenge.</i>

01:33:59.045 --> 01:34:02.652
<i>HERE'S THE SECRET NOBODY KNOWS.</i>

01:34:12.525 --> 01:34:15.472
Let's go get some fresh air.

01:34:17.029 --> 01:34:18.872
This is so beautiful.

01:34:24.136 --> 01:34:26.047
You're incredible, professor.

01:34:27.273 --> 01:34:29.549
Typing this perfect while
you cannot see anything.

01:34:30.609 --> 01:34:33.419
Also this is the best thing
you've ever written.

01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:41.430
Here's the secret nobody knows.

01:34:42.321 --> 01:34:44.733
I wander around the dim stars

01:34:45.357 --> 01:34:47.928
to reach out to your heart.

01:34:50.162 --> 01:34:51.766
I haven't finished it yet.

01:34:56.235 --> 01:34:59.341
Why couldn't you write this
when you had it all?

01:35:02.908 --> 01:35:05.218
Why do you write so good

01:35:06.145 --> 01:35:08.489
just when you're left helpless?

01:35:20.726 --> 01:35:21.864
Deokee!

01:35:23.028 --> 01:35:24.268
Miss me?

01:35:24.330 --> 01:35:27.641
Is that you, Chungee?

01:35:30.703 --> 01:35:31.841
My gin!

01:35:32.738 --> 01:35:33.910
Hi, dad.

01:35:35.141 --> 01:35:36.745
Nice sunglasses.

01:35:39.478 --> 01:35:41.651
I want to eat the pancakes.

01:35:42.014 --> 01:35:46.121
You don't know how much
I missed your pancakes.

01:35:49.622 --> 01:35:51.124
It's great to be back.

01:35:52.258 --> 01:35:55.569
That old man asked me
where I wanted to live.

01:35:55.861 --> 01:35:57.966
So I answered, 'With you!'

01:35:59.098 --> 01:36:01.874
Then he gave me one bill every day.

01:36:03.235 --> 01:36:04.646
Guess how much it was.

01:36:07.606 --> 01:36:08.846
One bill?

01:36:09.809 --> 01:36:10.810
One grand.

01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:12.981
I told him I didn't need the money

01:36:13.045 --> 01:36:15.252
but just wanted to be with him.

01:36:16.982 --> 01:36:19.394
Then he asked me if I didn't like money.

01:36:20.286 --> 01:36:22.391
I told him that I didn't
care just any money

01:36:23.389 --> 01:36:25.562
but did care the money he had.

01:36:27.726 --> 01:36:30.104
Then he flicked me on the forehead
with his finger.

01:36:31.730 --> 01:36:33.209
He's like a child.

01:36:34.834 --> 01:36:37.781
Are you listening to me?

01:36:39.004 --> 01:36:40.176
Sure.

01:36:41.907 --> 01:36:44.148
I missed this, so yummy!

01:36:44.610 --> 01:36:46.647
You guaranteed she would
never come out of there!

01:36:47.046 --> 01:36:49.080
<i>The girl seemed to get out</i>

01:36:49.081 --> 01:36:52.722
after paying off all her debt.

01:36:53.519 --> 01:36:57.194
Also she seems to be
quite spiteful and strong.

01:36:58.858 --> 01:37:02.396
I guess it's time for you two spiteful
women to handle it yourselves.

01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:15.746
This scar...

01:37:18.577 --> 01:37:20.250
It's because of my dad, right?

01:37:23.582 --> 01:37:25.755
You paid back quite enough.

01:37:26.619 --> 01:37:28.223
Why do you still linger?

01:37:35.861 --> 01:37:37.636
You must've suffered much.

01:37:40.332 --> 01:37:44.906
As a sweet little girl just
like I was when I met you.

01:37:46.038 --> 01:37:48.712
I guess that's why you did
all that to me and dad.

01:37:50.009 --> 01:37:51.283
I...

01:37:52.978 --> 01:37:55.720
I even hoped you could be my mother.

01:37:55.814 --> 01:37:57.020
I...

01:37:57.316 --> 01:37:58.920
I suffered a lot too.

01:38:00.052 --> 01:38:02.259
I was near to death because of you!

01:38:05.057 --> 01:38:10.029
I'll give you back what you did to us.
Just same.

01:38:10.396 --> 01:38:11.568
Out of my way!

01:38:17.736 --> 01:38:20.046
I told you not to come again.

01:38:22.107 --> 01:38:23.450
You should end what you started.

01:38:24.243 --> 01:38:25.813
Cut it off.

01:38:26.178 --> 01:38:30.320
I'm officially out of this.

01:38:30.916 --> 01:38:33.089
It's your battle to fight now.

01:38:35.554 --> 01:38:37.227
Brother, he's here.

01:38:45.698 --> 01:38:49.407
Sir, it's an honor to have you here.

01:38:52.771 --> 01:38:54.148
It's been a while.

01:38:54.707 --> 01:38:56.243
Please follow me.

01:39:10.756 --> 01:39:12.064
<i>Come to the clinic right now!</i>

01:39:12.324 --> 01:39:14.031
<i>Got some strange visitors!</i>

01:39:37.583 --> 01:39:39.119
I'm starving.

01:39:43.022 --> 01:39:48.973
You find all this funny?

01:40:21.727 --> 01:40:22.865
Deokee!

01:40:32.304 --> 01:40:34.682
What the hell are you doing?

01:40:37.476 --> 01:40:38.887
I told you...

01:40:39.945 --> 01:40:42.357
I will pay back exactly
the same you gave to us.

01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:49.931
I know that doctor helped
you make my dad blind.

01:40:53.425 --> 01:40:54.665
So?

01:40:59.698 --> 01:41:02.508
I think there's nothing you can do for now.

01:41:03.168 --> 01:41:05.876
You came too far.

01:41:07.906 --> 01:41:09.351
Don't blame me.

01:41:13.212 --> 01:41:17.922
Let me see him for once.

01:41:19.918 --> 01:41:21.420
You will.

01:41:24.256 --> 01:41:26.293
And dad will see you too.

01:41:28.427 --> 01:41:29.804
Through your eyes.

01:42:26.552 --> 01:42:28.657
Chungee said she brought the best doctors.

01:42:32.191 --> 01:42:34.467
We even took a walk together.

01:42:36.962 --> 01:42:41.638
She's changed a lot.

01:42:46.972 --> 01:42:50.852
I can't be with you anymore.

01:42:52.711 --> 01:42:53.815
Why not?

01:42:55.447 --> 01:43:00.123
I will get my job back and
publish new book after surgery.

01:43:01.019 --> 01:43:06.367
I feel really confident about my new book.

01:43:07.192 --> 01:43:08.262
Deokee!

01:43:12.364 --> 01:43:14.071
We can start all over.

01:43:15.767 --> 01:43:17.110
Please give me

01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:22.579
the second chance

01:43:23.842 --> 01:43:26.220
to make it up to to you and Chungee.

01:43:26.311 --> 01:43:27.551
Don't say that!

01:43:30.983 --> 01:43:33.293
Don't act like a good man!

01:43:36.588 --> 01:43:40.058
You should stay as a jerk!

01:43:45.964 --> 01:43:51.277
You have to be the evil till the very end!

01:43:55.707 --> 01:43:57.118
I am really sorry.

01:44:07.219 --> 01:44:08.493
Professor.

01:44:12.190 --> 01:44:14.466
What was the thing we had then?

01:44:28.507 --> 01:44:30.612
It was love, too.

01:44:31.143 --> 01:44:33.919
But I had no other choice.

01:44:41.053 --> 01:44:42.691
Please forgive me.

01:44:45.257 --> 01:44:47.498
I hurt you too much.

01:44:53.031 --> 01:44:55.773
I am really sorry.

01:45:00.472 --> 01:45:04.318
I gave you too much pain.

01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:04.609
<i>Deokee, let's go home now.</i>

01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:31.454
<i>I love you Deokee.</i>
