<i>- # These are
the in-between years #</i>

00:17.918 --> 00:21.762
<i># We're going through #</i>

00:21.838 --> 00:24.514
<i># These are
the precious dreams #</i>

00:24.591 --> 00:25.849
<i>- Mom!</i>

00:25.926 --> 00:29.644
<i>- # Wonderfully new #</i>

00:29.655 --> 00:32.522
<i># These are the years to dream #</i>

00:32.599 --> 00:34.399
<i>- Mom!</i>

00:34.476 --> 00:37.360
<i>- # Of what will be #</i>
- Shit.

00:37.437 --> 00:38.717
Is he...

00:40.357 --> 00:41.665
Mom!

00:41.742 --> 00:45.535
<i>- Don't goddamn yell
from the other room!</i>

00:46.988 --> 00:48.163
Here, here.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.759
You want him to live,
you gotta help.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.718
Okay, just push down.

00:52.795 --> 00:54.470
Push like that.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.882
Mom!

00:58.959 --> 01:00.884
- You know...

01:02.254 --> 01:04.888
I can't stand it when...

01:04.965 --> 01:10.110
<i>- # We'll treasure
in our memories #</i>

01:10.187 --> 01:12.479
- What'd you do?

01:12.556 --> 01:14.075
<i>- # These are
the in-between years #</i>

01:14.099 --> 01:18.068
<i># Come share them with me #</i>

01:41.334 --> 01:43.093
<i>- Hey.</i>

01:43.170 --> 01:44.397
<i>You ever lend money, goods,</i>

01:44.421 --> 01:45.974
<i>or other stuff to friends
or family</i>

01:45.998 --> 01:48.598
<i>and they take their sweet time
getting it back to you?</i>

01:48.675 --> 01:51.143
- Car's fucked.
We barely made it.

01:51.219 --> 01:52.986
There's battery fluid
all over the place.

01:53.063 --> 01:55.263
It won't hold a charge.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:55.315 --> 01:57.440
- What are we gonna do?
- Calm down.

01:57.517 --> 01:59.234
- Calm down?
These Sheila people are crazy.

01:59.245 --> 02:00.661
They shot up the whole park.

02:00.737 --> 02:02.498
They're rounding people up
and they're gonna execute them.

02:02.522 --> 02:03.905
- You're in my light.

02:03.982 --> 02:06.533
- Mom, they're hunting
outsiders.

02:06.610 --> 02:08.493
Do you understand?
These outsiders.

02:08.504 --> 02:10.256
When they don't find them,
they're gonna come here,

02:10.280 --> 02:11.955
and they're gonna kill me
and you.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.176
- God damn it!

02:13.200 --> 02:14.252
Do you see what you
just made me do?

02:14.276 --> 02:16.168
- Why won't you...
I fucked up. Okay?

02:16.244 --> 02:17.961
I fucked up.
They came to me.

02:18.038 --> 02:20.630
- Yes, you did the right thing
bringing them here.

02:20.707 --> 02:21.681
- We have to go.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.633
- We cannot move him like this.

02:23.710 --> 02:27.053
You... fuck him!

02:27.064 --> 02:29.231
He's bleeding out.
- Shut it.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.153
- I've almost got this.

02:40.268 --> 02:42.828
There it is.

02:44.981 --> 02:47.875
Now, there's an extra battery
up in the crawl space.

02:56.034 --> 02:57.759
We're gonna be friends.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.186
- Shit.
<i>- John?</i>

03:09.631 --> 03:10.814
<i>- The battery's fucked.</i>

03:17.305 --> 03:19.323
Oh, fuck.
It's Madysun.

03:19.399 --> 03:20.493
- What is she doing here?

03:20.517 --> 03:22.901
- She's one of 'em.

03:22.978 --> 03:24.152
- God damn it,

03:24.229 --> 03:25.673
I told you to stay away
from her!

03:25.697 --> 03:27.377
- It's better if we tell her.
She likes me.

03:27.407 --> 03:28.501
If I tell her
then it'll be okay.

03:28.525 --> 03:31.752
- No, you will not.

03:53.591 --> 03:56.351
<i>- John!
Open the door!</i>

03:58.638 --> 04:00.906
Hey.
- Where the hell have you been?

04:01.659 --> 04:04.901
I spent the last goddamn hour
looking for you.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.778
- You did?

04:06.855 --> 04:08.374
- What part of
"find the foreigners

04:08.398 --> 04:09.959
and bring them back"
was confusing?

04:09.983 --> 04:13.618
<i>- # But year after year
I come back #</i>

04:13.695 --> 04:15.745
Jesus, you live like a pig.

04:15.822 --> 04:17.631
<i>- # Just to remember #</i>

04:17.708 --> 04:19.510
- You want a drink or something?

04:19.534 --> 04:23.378
<i>- # The taste
of strawberry wine #</i>

04:23.389 --> 04:26.589
- Look... I messed up, okay?

04:26.666 --> 04:29.301
I admit that.
I got in way over my head,

04:29.377 --> 04:32.345
but I didn't know it was
gonna go down like that.

04:32.422 --> 04:34.817
- You put the bullets
in the guns.

04:34.841 --> 04:37.892
- No, I... I know.
- Turn that shit off!

04:39.129 --> 04:40.906
<i>- What did you think
would go down?</i>

04:40.930 --> 04:42.397
- Okay, I don't have any problem

04:42.408 --> 04:43.688
with your whole movement.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.461
I'm just not looking
to be a part of it.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.202
- It's a little late for that.

04:47.279 --> 04:49.037
So where are they?

04:55.570 --> 04:57.045
- Sorry, who?

05:18.360 --> 05:21.061
- I told you.
There's nobody here.

05:21.137 --> 05:23.271
- Don't fuck with me, John.

05:23.348 --> 05:24.606
- I'm not.

05:30.456 --> 05:32.280
- Nobody's here?

05:32.357 --> 05:35.459
Nobody's here?
- No... no one but me and my mom!

05:35.535 --> 05:37.369
She's taking a shower.

05:37.445 --> 05:39.204
What?
She's taking...

05:39.280 --> 05:41.164
She's taking a shower.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.717
- Tell her to get out here now.

05:47.973 --> 05:50.557
Mom, we have company.

05:53.795 --> 05:55.387
Come on.
This is nuts.

05:55.463 --> 05:56.482
<i>Why would I help them?</i>

05:57.966 --> 05:59.568
<i>- I hate the bastards
as much as you do.</i>

05:59.592 --> 06:01.084
<i>- We had them tracked.</i>

06:01.161 --> 06:03.406
Okay, we saw your piece of shit
truck tearing out of there!

06:03.430 --> 06:04.490
- Yeah, I know.

06:04.514 --> 06:05.850
I shouldn't have
run off like that,

06:05.874 --> 06:08.233
but honestly I...
- They saw someone with you.

06:08.309 --> 06:09.984
- What?
Bullshit.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.835
That's a lie.
Who said that?

06:11.896 --> 06:13.163
- Sheila.

06:14.625 --> 06:17.659
- Sheila said that?
Well, she made a mistake.

06:17.735 --> 06:20.578
It was dark and there were
people running around.

06:20.655 --> 06:21.791
She probably...
- Yeah.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.375
That's what Sheila said
you'd say.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.210
She'll be here soon.

06:27.287 --> 06:29.379
- Oh.
Good.

06:37.439 --> 06:38.814
- In your pocket?

06:41.342 --> 06:43.143
<i>- You know,</i>

06:43.153 --> 06:45.645
if you tell me where
they are now,

06:45.722 --> 06:48.690
I might go easy on you, John,

06:48.700 --> 06:52.193
seeing as we had our

06:52.270 --> 06:56.448
little thing that one time

06:56.524 --> 06:59.451
and you were kinda sweet,

06:59.527 --> 07:01.619
but when Sheila gets here...

07:01.696 --> 07:03.371
- I still think
about that night.

07:03.448 --> 07:04.831
- Don't change the subject.

07:08.995 --> 07:12.806
Mm, guess she's done in there.

07:14.709 --> 07:17.469
I'm checking the roof next,
John,

07:17.545 --> 07:20.054
and if I find them up there,

07:20.065 --> 07:22.557
I'm gonna take this

07:22.568 --> 07:25.735
and I'm gonna blow
your mom's brains out.

07:27.847 --> 07:29.647
- I don't have your foreigners.

07:29.724 --> 07:31.450
- Last chance.

07:33.144 --> 07:35.704
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

07:37.232 --> 07:38.957
- I swear to God.

07:43.279 --> 07:44.662
- Lying motherfucker!

07:44.739 --> 07:45.622
<i>- Wait, wait, wait!
- No!</i>

07:45.698 --> 07:47.018
<i>- Wait!
- No!</i>

07:47.042 --> 07:49.626
- They didn't do anything!
- Is that what you think?

07:49.702 --> 07:51.044
Move!

07:51.120 --> 07:53.296
- Madysun, I love you.

07:53.373 --> 07:54.764
- What?

07:54.841 --> 07:58.009
- What?
- Shut the fuck up.

08:12.475 --> 08:15.535
- I don't wanna hear it.

08:26.081 --> 08:28.873
- Time to go.
- He needs Soma.

08:28.950 --> 08:30.416
- He needs the wound closed.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.801
- You killed her.

08:39.877 --> 08:42.136
- Somebody had to.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.814
I've waited a long time
to get out.

08:44.891 --> 08:48.017
I'm sure as hell not getting
stuck because some psycho girl

08:48.094 --> 08:50.478
gave you a hand job once.

08:50.555 --> 08:53.033
Now get up off your ass.
Let's go.

08:53.057 --> 08:56.326
We need to get them down
and we need to get her up.

08:57.020 --> 08:59.663
It's better that they're
looking for her than us.

09:26.841 --> 09:28.057
- Hey, hey!

09:28.068 --> 09:30.268
What about Madysun's bike?
I can drive it.

09:30.345 --> 09:32.186
- We're not leaving
without these people.

09:32.263 --> 09:33.407
Get that through your head!
- Hey!

09:33.431 --> 09:34.272
I think we've done enough.

09:34.349 --> 09:35.498
I know I have.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.816
If it weren't for me,
they'd be dead.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.201
- Yeah, and if it wasn't
for you,

09:38.278 --> 09:40.662
I wouldn't have a corpse
in my crawl space.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.044
- Bernard, wake up.
Stay awake.

09:45.068 --> 09:47.201
- I want to go back
to the hotel.

09:55.536 --> 09:57.962
- Okay, it happens all the time.

09:58.039 --> 10:00.059
The dark is our friend.
- Where are we going?

10:00.083 --> 10:01.803
Mo... no.

10:04.379 --> 10:06.304
- Mom, don't!

10:06.381 --> 10:08.473
- You stay there
and keep out of sight.

10:37.787 --> 10:39.554
- What the hell
are you doing here?

10:39.631 --> 10:42.840
Shut up, asshole!

10:42.917 --> 10:45.843
- She home?
- Linda.

10:50.091 --> 10:53.351
- Shame she doesn't
know what she has.

10:53.428 --> 10:54.727
- Go home.

10:54.804 --> 10:56.354
Those cult people
started a riot.

10:56.431 --> 10:57.689
The whole town's on fire.

10:57.765 --> 11:00.525
- Mm-hmm.
- Shit.

11:00.601 --> 11:02.443
Don't do this to me.

11:02.520 --> 11:03.778
- What am I doing?

11:03.789 --> 11:06.197
- You know exactly.

11:06.274 --> 11:08.708
- I know that it's cold outside.

11:10.278 --> 11:11.536
- Wow.

11:11.612 --> 11:12.923
Hey!

11:12.947 --> 11:15.164
Hey, who's there?

11:15.241 --> 11:17.875
- You gotta let us in, baby.
- Us?

11:17.952 --> 11:20.962
No, no way.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.588
- We're in trouble.

11:22.665 --> 11:25.216
- They're foreigners.
I can't.

11:25.293 --> 11:27.104
- I've never asked
anything of you,

11:27.128 --> 11:29.229
and you have asked a lot of me.

11:30.214 --> 11:32.399
- You're gonna get me killed.

11:35.845 --> 11:37.854
You show some respect
in my house.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.272
- Sure, man.

11:39.348 --> 11:41.118
You've always been like
a really terrible,

11:41.142 --> 11:42.283
shitty father to me.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.996
- You shut up your fucking dog?

11:55.006 --> 11:56.842
- It's my wife's dog.
I don't go near it.

11:56.866 --> 11:59.426
He hates me more than she does.

12:02.997 --> 12:05.089
Oh, Jesus.
What'd you do to him?

12:05.166 --> 12:08.009
- I removed a bullet
and saved his life.

12:08.085 --> 12:09.980
- It looks to me like
you just kinda hacked him

12:10.004 --> 12:11.148
and stabbed him a bunch.

12:11.172 --> 12:13.222
- Well, I'd like
to see you do better.

12:13.299 --> 12:14.985
- Guy looks like Rodney
when I ran over his legs

12:15.009 --> 12:16.517
with a lawnmower.

12:16.594 --> 12:18.486
- We need to close him up.

12:20.348 --> 12:22.365
Okay, come on.
Let's sit you up.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.244
- Here you go, buddy.
Made this myself.

12:24.268 --> 12:25.109
Come on.

12:25.186 --> 12:27.454
- It's liquid Soma.
Come on.

12:37.865 --> 12:39.883
- No, I'm making some changes.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.627
- Yeah, sure you are.

12:42.703 --> 12:44.181
Come on.
More for us, buddy.

12:44.205 --> 12:45.516
Let's go.
- It burns!

12:45.540 --> 12:47.518
- That's how you know
it's working.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.512
- Fuck, they're here.

13:14.861 --> 13:17.578
I want to go home.

13:17.655 --> 13:20.248
- I get that.

13:20.324 --> 13:22.884
- You take us.
You saved us.

13:22.910 --> 13:25.169
Me.

13:25.246 --> 13:26.303
- Yeah.

13:26.381 --> 13:29.224
I did but...
- But now you won't?

13:30.793 --> 13:33.052
- Well, I just... I... I... I saw you

13:33.129 --> 13:36.264
and I... I don't know.

13:36.340 --> 13:38.942
You don't even understand
what's happening, do you?

13:39.018 --> 13:41.853
Why these people here hate you.

13:41.929 --> 13:43.209
- It's your conditioning.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.490
Violence, your selfishness,
your fear.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.151
You're very confused.

13:49.228 --> 13:52.205
- Hold on.
- John.

13:52.282 --> 13:53.906
John.

13:53.983 --> 13:55.491
Leave her alone.

13:57.203 --> 14:00.329
- Linda, why are you risking
your ass for these outsiders?

14:00.406 --> 14:02.259
You're gonna wind up in a ditch.

14:02.283 --> 14:04.417
- Just fix him up.
I need him.

14:04.493 --> 14:07.053
- Him?
Why?

14:08.473 --> 14:10.473
- Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.427
- Give me a hand here, kid.

14:14.503 --> 14:16.679
- Fuck you.
I ain't your kid.

14:23.346 --> 14:25.855
- I didn't know booze
even worked on their kind.

14:25.932 --> 14:28.065
- It does.

14:28.142 --> 14:30.493
Yeah, so...

14:30.570 --> 14:32.904
- You need to cauterize him.
- What?

14:32.980 --> 14:35.072
- Cauterize.

14:35.149 --> 14:36.449
Worked for Rodney.

14:36.525 --> 14:39.076
- Rodney?
Rodney, your fucking dog?

14:39.153 --> 14:40.995
Rodney's a paraplegic, man.

14:41.006 --> 14:43.423
- Oh, man, he gets around okay.

15:04.512 --> 15:05.653
- That's better.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.912
I know you think you need
that Soma,

15:13.988 --> 15:16.122
that you might die without it.

15:17.191 --> 15:19.867
But the truth is, you won't.

15:19.944 --> 15:22.253
That's the cruelest part.

15:24.323 --> 15:26.966
To be forced to cope.

15:28.953 --> 15:32.630
All that time
and nothing to fill it.

15:32.707 --> 15:38.260
So you imagine or remember.

15:38.337 --> 15:41.472
I used to think about
this gorgeous,

15:41.549 --> 15:45.234
gorgeous orange clouds over
the crematorium.

15:45.311 --> 15:48.062
Then after a while you start
to wonder if those things

15:48.073 --> 15:51.074
that you cling to,
if they're even real.

15:52.101 --> 15:53.660
- You're a Beta.

15:55.438 --> 15:56.718
- Plus.

15:59.734 --> 16:01.867
- How are you...

16:01.944 --> 16:04.045
- Here?
- A mother.

16:06.532 --> 16:07.707
Sorry.
I didn't mean to...

16:07.783 --> 16:09.052
- No, no.

16:09.076 --> 16:10.409
I knew what you meant.

16:12.038 --> 16:14.349
I used to think being a mother
was the worst thing

16:14.373 --> 16:16.757
a person could be.

16:16.834 --> 16:19.468
But it's not.

16:19.545 --> 16:21.354
Abandoned...

16:23.257 --> 16:25.358
That's the worst.

16:29.388 --> 16:33.282
You come with an Alpha,
you leave with an Alpha,

16:33.359 --> 16:37.028
but if the Alpha
leaves you behind...

16:37.104 --> 16:38.621
- It wouldn't happen.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.698
They wouldn't just leave
someone like...

16:40.775 --> 16:43.409
- You?

16:45.821 --> 16:48.381
Now what?

16:57.792 --> 16:58.966
- What'd you do to him?

16:59.043 --> 17:00.134
- Fixed him, like I said.

17:00.145 --> 17:01.310
- Here, let me see.

17:01.387 --> 17:03.137
- He... he burned me!

17:03.214 --> 17:05.598
- Yes, but you're gonna
be all right.

17:05.674 --> 17:07.527
Come on.

17:07.551 --> 17:08.893
- They... they burned me!

17:08.969 --> 17:10.111
- Keep your voice down.

17:10.188 --> 17:13.022
- I'm gonna report you
and you and you...

17:13.099 --> 17:14.690
- Take it easy.
Come on, take it easy.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.942
- To the bureau when I...
When we...

17:17.019 --> 17:18.486
This is how he wants it.

17:18.562 --> 17:20.791
Do you see?
The Director.

17:20.815 --> 17:23.824
He wants me banished.
We're never going back.

17:23.901 --> 17:25.087
We're gonna die here.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.827
- Bernard, stop.
What's wrong with him?

17:26.904 --> 17:30.673
- If we live...
I'll be monogamous with you.

17:37.164 --> 17:38.255
- They found Madysun.

17:49.343 --> 17:51.154
- Shit, she's coming.
Get down.

17:51.178 --> 17:52.528
- Come on.
Let's get you down.

18:19.623 --> 18:22.266
- Okay, I think she's leaving.

18:23.302 --> 18:25.302
- Are you an Alpha?

18:25.379 --> 18:28.055
- Alpha Plus.
How... how'd you...

18:28.132 --> 18:29.974
- Can you get us
through the barrier?

18:30.050 --> 18:31.475
- What?

18:31.552 --> 18:34.103
- If I take you to the barrier,

18:34.180 --> 18:37.240
will you take us through?

18:37.316 --> 18:38.910
- Yeah.
Yes.

18:38.934 --> 18:40.120
Yes, I can do that.

18:40.144 --> 18:42.027
- Good.
That's really good.

18:42.104 --> 18:44.113
Is your truck charged?

18:44.190 --> 18:45.792
- What the hell you want
with my truck?

18:45.816 --> 18:47.794
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
More of them.

18:47.818 --> 18:49.076
- Oh, shit.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.296
- That's my wife.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.042
Y'all need to get
the fuck out of here.

18:57.119 --> 18:58.419
- Don't go out there.

18:58.495 --> 19:00.504
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

19:00.581 --> 19:02.840
- What are you doing home, baby?

19:02.917 --> 19:05.634
- I live here.
Betty's house is full of smoke.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.731
- Well, I just wanted
to see you, baby.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.107
- You been drinking without me?

19:09.131 --> 19:10.181
- The keys.

19:10.257 --> 19:12.483
<i>- Motherfucker!</i>

19:12.560 --> 19:15.144
<i>That slut in my house again...</i>

19:15.221 --> 19:16.687
Let go of me!

19:16.764 --> 19:20.024
Linda!
I'll kill you, bitch!

19:20.100 --> 19:21.108
- Calm down.

19:21.185 --> 19:23.277
- Get the fuck off of me!

19:23.288 --> 19:26.289
- Got 'em.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.126
- Okay, come on.
Get him up.

19:28.150 --> 19:29.669
We gotta move.
Mom, now!

19:29.693 --> 19:32.620
- Stand aside.
- Can't do that.

19:32.696 --> 19:33.882
- Now!

19:34.949 --> 19:36.165
Let's go.
Come on.

19:43.791 --> 19:45.518
Mom, get in the car!

19:45.542 --> 19:47.479
Come on!

19:50.297 --> 19:52.181
- Come on.
Get in.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.682
- Come on!

19:56.303 --> 20:00.064

21:48.123 --> 21:49.225

to the hotel.</i>

21:49.249 --> 21:50.433
<i>- What about the Barrier?</i>

21:50.509 --> 21:52.092
<i>- Just get us as close
to the launch pad...</i>

21:52.103 --> 21:53.185
<i>- Fuck that!</i>

21:53.262 --> 21:55.387
<i>I'm not going anywhere
near there!</i>

21:55.464 --> 21:58.223
- What is that?

21:58.300 --> 21:59.683
Slow down.

21:59.760 --> 22:02.436

22:05.140 --> 22:07.733
<i>Get ready.
We have to make a run for it.</i>

22:07.744 --> 22:09.401
There's room on the shoulder.

22:09.478 --> 22:11.871
John, what are you doing?
- Shh.

22:15.818 --> 22:17.618
- Come on.
You've gotta just stay calm.

22:24.543 --> 22:26.469
John, no!
John!

22:32.626 --> 22:34.593
Don't you move.

22:52.813 --> 22:54.997
- They're coming back, right?

22:55.074 --> 22:56.615
They're coming back.

22:58.527 --> 23:00.285
- Bernard, act your level!

23:00.362 --> 23:01.912
- You took the last Soma.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.039
- What?

23:04.116 --> 23:05.299
What is it?

23:09.380 --> 23:11.755
I feel terrible!

23:11.832 --> 23:13.465
- We'll have Soma soon,
Bernard, okay?

23:13.542 --> 23:14.466
These people are gonna help us.

23:14.543 --> 23:15.926
- These people!

23:18.398 --> 23:19.638
- What are you doing?

23:19.715 --> 23:20.773
- Acting my level.

23:20.850 --> 23:22.266
- Bernard, you don't know how!
Stop!

23:22.342 --> 23:24.320
- I watched the bus driver.
It's not complicated.

23:24.344 --> 23:26.384
I'm getting us away
from these people.

23:26.430 --> 23:28.188
They shoot you, burn you.

23:28.199 --> 23:29.648
- They saved our lives.

23:29.725 --> 23:31.494
The woman, Linda...
- She's a killer!

23:31.518 --> 23:33.652
They all are.
- She's one of us.

23:33.729 --> 23:35.707
She's from New London.
- She's a mother!

23:35.731 --> 23:37.614
- She's a Beta Plus.

23:37.691 --> 23:39.283
Same as me.

23:39.293 --> 23:42.711
- You'll believe anything
they say, won't you?

23:47.451 --> 23:49.668
- John.
John!

23:49.745 --> 23:51.962
Wait.
- I am not dying for them.

23:52.039 --> 23:53.683
- This is our chance to go home.

23:53.707 --> 23:55.268
- Jesus,
when are you gonna stop?

23:55.292 --> 23:58.060
You're not one of them.
Look at yourself.

23:58.137 --> 24:01.063
- I am a Beta Plus.
- You're a drunk.

24:02.558 --> 24:04.850
- You're right,

24:04.927 --> 24:06.518
and I'm a shit mother,

24:06.595 --> 24:08.729
but I am not a liar.

24:08.805 --> 24:11.398
I am a Beta Plus and your father

24:11.475 --> 24:12.941
is an Alpha Plus.

24:13.018 --> 24:14.704
He was the Warden...
- Warden of the Savage Lands.

24:14.728 --> 24:16.403
It's a lie and I let you tell it

24:16.480 --> 24:19.156
because it's the only thing
that ever made you happy,

24:19.233 --> 24:21.241
but now it's gonna get us
fucking killed,

24:21.318 --> 24:22.543
so I'm done.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.835
What the fuck was that?
What was that?

24:31.912 --> 24:34.880
You're taking their drugs now,
too?

24:34.957 --> 24:37.517
- You don't know what it's like.

24:38.460 --> 24:39.740
You don't.

24:41.129 --> 24:42.429
Come with me.

24:42.506 --> 24:46.433
Even if you don't believe me,
come with me.

24:46.510 --> 24:49.269
- You've seen what the barrier
does to a person, right?

24:49.346 --> 24:51.032
- Yes, and Bernard
can get us through.

24:51.056 --> 24:52.350
- Oh!
- He's an Alpha.

24:52.374 --> 24:53.607
That's how it works!
- Bullshit!

24:57.020 --> 24:59.029
There's no pain there, John.

24:59.106 --> 25:01.114
No fear.

25:01.191 --> 25:04.701
Everyone fits.
No one's ever alone.

25:04.778 --> 25:06.629
I want that for you.

25:06.705 --> 25:09.265
I've always wanted that for you.

25:10.909 --> 25:13.886
Don't you wanna know
who you are?

25:18.834 --> 25:20.809
Please don't make me choose.

25:25.841 --> 25:27.318
<i>- Bernard...
- I'm doing it!</i>

25:27.342 --> 25:28.653
Lenina, I'm doing it!
I'm driving!

25:28.677 --> 25:30.319
I'm driving the auto car!

25:32.014 --> 25:33.866
Wait, how... how does it...
- Bernard?

25:33.890 --> 25:36.158
Make it stop.
- Don't shout at me!

25:36.235 --> 25:37.579
It's not responding!
- Oh, Bernard.

25:39.271 --> 25:40.999
- She said don't move
and you're moving!

25:41.023 --> 25:43.304
They said don't move!
- Need to make the car stop.

25:44.943 --> 25:46.596
Stupid Savage technology!
- Bernard!

25:53.785 --> 25:55.719
- Oh, shit!

26:02.878 --> 26:05.115
- Stop it!
Stop it right now!

26:05.139 --> 26:06.241
Do you wanna get
yourselves killed?

26:06.265 --> 26:08.181
Come on, get out.
- Get out of the car.

26:08.192 --> 26:09.861
- It's broken.
It's not me.

26:13.221 --> 26:14.563
- Get out!
- I can do it.

26:14.574 --> 26:16.001
- Right now.
- Come on.

26:16.025 --> 26:17.619
Come on.
Come on, let's go.

26:17.643 --> 26:18.826
Let's go.

26:22.123 --> 26:23.488
- We... we're lost, aren't we?

26:23.565 --> 26:25.499
- It can't be much further.

26:25.576 --> 26:28.136
We just need to stay off
the road.

26:30.456 --> 26:33.382
All right, just one foot
in front of the other.

26:34.576 --> 26:36.668
- I drove the auto car.

26:36.745 --> 26:38.378
You saw.
- Yes.

26:38.389 --> 26:40.297
Very impressive.

26:40.374 --> 26:42.224
- Look at me.

26:42.301 --> 26:43.225
Where is it?

26:43.302 --> 26:44.562
- Where's what?
- My Soma.

26:44.586 --> 26:46.303
The Soma.
You... I'm a counselor.

26:46.380 --> 26:47.420
I can see it in your eyes.

26:51.593 --> 26:53.027
- Last one.

26:54.137 --> 26:55.729
Come on.
- I can walk myself.

26:55.740 --> 26:56.989
Thank you.

26:59.101 --> 27:01.193
- I keep thinking
about that woman.

27:01.269 --> 27:04.413
Madysun, the one that you...
- Don't talk.

27:10.696 --> 27:11.976
What are you doing?

27:15.334 --> 27:16.614
Stop that.

27:19.454 --> 27:20.804
Is this...

27:22.841 --> 27:25.384
This can't be how
you people feel.

27:29.798 --> 27:31.398
- Welcome to the real world.

27:34.177 --> 27:35.769
Stop it.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.738
Stop crying.
- How?

27:39.057 --> 27:42.234
- I... I... you... I don't... you stop.

27:42.310 --> 27:44.453
Just stop.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.791
Stop.
No.

27:46.815 --> 27:49.282
Just...

27:49.293 --> 27:51.794
Stop.

28:01.830 --> 28:03.806
- So what's it like there?

28:03.882 --> 28:08.218
- New London?
I thought you knew.

28:08.295 --> 28:09.561
- I do.

28:09.638 --> 28:11.805
I just wanted to know
if it was the same.

28:11.816 --> 28:14.474
- Of course.
Nothing ever changes.

28:14.485 --> 28:17.686
- Yeah, I have.

28:17.763 --> 28:19.490
You know, time passes here.

28:19.514 --> 28:22.034
There's nothing anyone
can do about it.

28:22.058 --> 28:24.546
I just wondered if...
I mean, if I would still fit.

28:24.570 --> 28:25.944
- Just stop this.

28:26.021 --> 28:27.199
- What, you don't believe me?

28:27.223 --> 28:28.583
- It doesn't matter
what I believe.

28:30.275 --> 28:32.451
I don't control the Barrier.

28:32.527 --> 28:33.794
Indra does.

28:39.826 --> 28:43.503
- You're too many people
at once.

28:43.580 --> 28:45.130
You save us, you don't.

28:45.207 --> 28:46.276
You're violent, you're gentle,

28:46.300 --> 28:47.799
you're angry, you're scared.

28:47.876 --> 28:49.020
- I'm not.
- Impulsive.

28:49.044 --> 28:50.519
- Yeah, primitive Savage.

28:50.596 --> 28:52.356
- I didn't say that.
- Yeah, you don't need to.

28:52.380 --> 28:54.066
You people come here,
gawk at us,

28:54.090 --> 28:55.485
judge us, fly the fuck home.

28:55.509 --> 28:57.153
I know exactly
what you think of me.

28:57.177 --> 28:58.235
- We think that you...

28:59.679 --> 29:00.854
- Go on.

29:00.865 --> 29:01.991
Oh, shit!

29:02.015 --> 29:04.107
Mom, stay down!

29:09.948 --> 29:11.740
Let's go!

29:11.817 --> 29:13.533
Come on!

29:16.696 --> 29:17.921
Go!

29:25.330 --> 29:26.764
Run!

29:29.793 --> 29:31.676
Lenina!

29:37.133 --> 29:38.901
- Let's go, John.
We've gotta go.

29:38.977 --> 29:39.977
- I won't make it.

29:40.020 --> 29:41.581
- The last one.
Hurry.

29:41.605 --> 29:43.199
Lenina, there's nothing we can
do for... the rocket's leaving.

29:43.223 --> 29:46.483
We...
- Abandoned.

29:46.560 --> 29:47.868
That's the worst.

29:49.604 --> 29:51.038
- You can do it.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.085
Please, John.
Come on.

29:54.109 --> 29:56.669
Come on.
We've gotta go.

30:19.309 --> 30:21.568
You okay?

30:21.645 --> 30:24.563
- Yes.

30:24.639 --> 30:27.074
Let's go home.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.369
- You.

30:32.147 --> 30:34.281
You go back there.

30:34.357 --> 30:36.294
You tell your kind
we will not suffer

30:36.318 --> 30:38.243
for their amusement anymore.

30:38.254 --> 30:40.912
Beyond this barrier,
they will find only death.

30:40.989 --> 30:43.215
Do you understand me?

30:43.292 --> 30:45.750
We are free people.

30:45.761 --> 30:47.752
This is our land.

30:56.004 --> 30:57.762
Even better.

31:27.160 --> 31:29.720
- Oh, look.
There it is.

31:30.705 --> 31:33.181
Oh, it's so beautiful.

31:34.834 --> 31:36.635
- What is it?

31:39.714 --> 31:41.056
It's New London.

31:45.053 --> 31:47.479
I knew I'd see it again.

31:52.778 --> 31:54.653
- What are they gonna do to us?

31:58.358 --> 31:59.666
Mom?

32:09.828 --> 32:11.836
- Don't call me that.

32:34.561 --> 32:35.619
- Mom.

32:36.563 --> 32:37.563
Mom.

32:41.776 --> 32:42.776
Mom.

32:44.663 --> 32:45.663
Mom!

32:47.615 --> 32:49.216
Mom!

32:50.618 --> 32:52.219
Mom!

32:54.098 --> 32:55.389
Mom!

33:31.951 --> 33:34.636
- Turns out I rather
enjoy decontamination.

33:37.591 --> 33:39.141
Who knew?

33:39.217 --> 33:40.517
Ah.

33:47.300 --> 33:48.516
My shoulder's fixed.

33:48.593 --> 33:50.404
Good as new.
Didn't feel a thing.

33:50.428 --> 33:51.820
It's all new.

33:57.143 --> 33:58.385
I, um...

34:02.124 --> 34:03.665
Fully restocked.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.302
For next time I try to drive.

34:19.541 --> 34:21.341
- What do we do now?

34:21.417 --> 34:22.801
- Well, we go home.

34:22.877 --> 34:24.522
Um, they'll send
a Gamma up shortly to...

34:24.546 --> 34:26.805
- No, um, after that.

34:26.881 --> 34:27.881
You know, just...

34:30.135 --> 34:31.651
Home and work.

34:33.021 --> 34:34.771
After that, after today,

34:34.848 --> 34:35.906
how do we...

34:38.952 --> 34:40.202
What do we do?

34:46.734 --> 34:48.835
- What we've always done.

34:56.970 --> 34:58.545
- What did she say to you?

34:58.621 --> 35:01.548
- What... what did who?

35:01.624 --> 35:03.475
- That Sheila woman
at the Barrier.

35:03.552 --> 35:06.010
We were leaving
and you turned back and...

35:06.087 --> 35:07.648
- I don't think so.
- Well, no, I saw you.

35:07.672 --> 35:12.433
You turned back
and she spoke to you.

35:12.510 --> 35:13.510
What did she say?

35:13.587 --> 35:16.146
- Oh, my God.
I don't remember.

35:16.222 --> 35:20.242
Um, she said she, um...

35:21.644 --> 35:23.945
She was rambling,
you know, raving.

35:24.022 --> 35:25.914
As they do.

35:26.416 --> 35:30.702
Uh, she said... she said, um,

35:30.778 --> 35:32.620
that we shouldn't
go back there anymore.

35:32.697 --> 35:35.331
You know, they're quite
territorial, actually.

35:35.408 --> 35:37.000
Um, they said something
about they're...

35:37.010 --> 35:39.010
They're free people now.

35:40.580 --> 35:42.755
- Free from what?

35:42.766 --> 35:45.326
- Why are we talking about this?

35:46.270 --> 35:48.344
They're savages, Lenina.

35:48.421 --> 35:50.981
They don't even
understand themselves.

36:22.038 --> 36:24.380
- Where is she?

36:24.457 --> 36:28.009
I know you're out there!
Where the fuck is she?

36:28.086 --> 36:29.802
Where is she?

36:29.813 --> 36:31.554
I wanna see her!

36:31.565 --> 36:33.899
I wanna see her now!

36:35.218 --> 36:36.818
Where's my mom?

36:37.971 --> 36:38.971
Where is she?

36:39.639 --> 36:40.864
Where is she?

36:42.016 --> 36:44.326
Where is she?

36:46.062 --> 36:48.747
You show her to me now!

37:11.587 --> 37:12.854
- He's asking to see her.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.716
- There's nothing to see.

37:20.471 --> 37:23.031
These people don't cope
with death.

37:23.233 --> 37:24.524
They don't understand it.

37:24.600 --> 37:27.026
They've been conditioned
to fear it.

37:27.103 --> 37:28.453
They go mad.

37:29.605 --> 37:31.781
- He's going mad as it is.

37:31.858 --> 37:35.543
- Indulge their grief,
they become something else.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.507
Something...

37:42.386 --> 37:43.666
Permanent.

37:45.913 --> 37:47.193
Useless.

37:49.625 --> 37:51.342
Trust me.

37:51.419 --> 37:53.979
In the interest of stability.

37:54.398 --> 37:56.106
I've seen it before.

37:58.926 --> 38:00.226
- So have I.

38:15.485 --> 38:17.410
- Where is she?

38:20.031 --> 38:21.873
Where is she?

38:21.949 --> 38:25.084
Where is she, you motherfucker?

38:28.456 --> 38:30.682
- Where the fuck is she?

38:34.253 --> 38:36.062
Let me out of here!

38:37.840 --> 38:40.224
- Tsss!
- I want to see her!

38:42.804 --> 38:44.520
Let me the fuck out!

38:50.770 --> 38:52.495
- I want to see her.

38:54.482 --> 38:55.874
I wanna see her.

38:58.236 --> 39:00.462
Where am I?
- John?

39:01.280 --> 39:02.464
<i>John.</i>

39:03.467 --> 39:04.799
- Where am I?

39:05.993 --> 39:07.010
Where am I?

39:08.287 --> 39:09.721
<i>- You're home, John.</i>

39:13.209 --> 39:15.185
- Who are you?

39:15.261 --> 39:16.719
<i>- Welcome.</i>
