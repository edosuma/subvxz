00:13.745 --> 00:18.206
Jim, we both know that you've been
one of the most outspoken opponents

00:18.291 --> 00:20.617
to my decision to call off this attack.

00:20.710 --> 00:24.874
If you have something to say, I would
expect you to bring it to me first.

00:25.006 --> 00:27.960
Does the president have
any idea what's going on?

00:28.093 --> 00:30.880
- I don't think so.
- Let's keep it that way.

00:31.012 --> 00:32.839
Thank you for assembling
at such short notice.

00:32.973 --> 00:35.927
I'm sure you're all wondering
why I've invited you here.

00:36.017 --> 00:40.098
It is my sincere belief, based on
his response to today's events,

00:40.188 --> 00:45.562
David Palmer is unfit to continue
as President of the United States.

00:45.944 --> 00:47.853
Looks like you've had quite a day.

00:47.946 --> 00:50.152
- I didn't kill anyone.
- I know you didn't.

00:50.240 --> 00:53.241
We know Gary Matheson killed his wife.
We're looking for him now.

00:53.326 --> 00:56.945
So you're off the hook for everything
that happened this morning.

00:57.706 --> 01:00.623
I thought I made myself clear, Tony.
We're past Bauer.

01:00.709 --> 01:03.116
No, sir. You are. I'm not.

01:03.211 --> 01:05.785
Now, if you're not comfortable with
me making my own decisions here,

01:05.881 --> 01:07.920
I suggest you relieve me
of my duties right now.

01:08.008 --> 01:10.047
That won't be necessary.

01:10.844 --> 01:12.635
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't thank me.

01:12.721 --> 01:15.390
I just don't have anyone
to take your place right now.

01:15.724 --> 01:17.432
- No!
- Come on, give me that!

01:19.436 --> 01:22.437
- Kate, are you all right?
- Yeah. They've got the chip!

01:24.733 --> 01:26.192
All I want is the chip!

01:28.570 --> 01:33.149
You come in here, I'm gonna smash
this thing. I'll put it right under my foot!

01:40.707 --> 01:43.459
- Tell me who I'm speaking to.
- It doesn't matter.

01:43.543 --> 01:47.327
We got something your girlfriend
was about to pay us for.

01:47.422 --> 01:48.453
Listen to me.

01:48.548 --> 01:52.795
Five hours ago, a nuclear bomb
went off. I'm sure you know.

01:52.886 --> 01:57.299
The chip will show who's responsible.
It's vital to our investigation.

01:57.390 --> 02:02.515
The man you assaulted was an agent
bringing the chip to my office.

02:04.397 --> 02:08.478
Give me the chip back,
and I'll let you walk, no questions.

02:08.568 --> 02:10.644
- You're setting us up.
- Get back.

02:10.737 --> 02:13.691
What are you doing? They killed Yusuf.

02:13.782 --> 02:17.447
We're about to attack
three innocent countries.

02:17.536 --> 02:24.037
I can only stop it with that chip, so I'm
gonna do everything I can to get it back.

02:24.126 --> 02:29.120
Please, Kate, I need your help.
Get in touch with CTU. Please!

02:30.549 --> 02:32.588
You have 30 seconds to open that door.

02:32.676 --> 02:34.419
- Give it to him.
- Are you crazy?

02:34.511 --> 02:36.800
This is the only thing
keeping him from killing us.

02:36.888 --> 02:38.169
You got 20 seconds!

02:38.265 --> 02:41.052
- We should trust you?
- You don't have a choice.

02:41.143 --> 02:43.219
- Give it to him. He's serious!
- So am I.

02:43.311 --> 02:45.802
He's gonna kill us
if we don't open the door.

02:50.652 --> 02:53.902
Against the wall! Now! Where's the chip?

02:53.989 --> 02:55.981
I dropped it.

02:56.992 --> 02:58.984
Don't move.

02:59.828 --> 03:01.821
Kate! Kate!

03:04.291 --> 03:05.915
I need wire to tie them up.

03:06.001 --> 03:08.492
- What about the chip?
- I've got it.

03:19.723 --> 03:26.057
Just got this Pentagon briefing stating that
our bombers aren't going back to their bases.

03:26.855 --> 03:28.433
Do you know about this?

03:28.523 --> 03:32.141
I understand they're holding,
awaiting refuelling.

03:32.235 --> 03:34.643
I ordered them back to their bases.

03:34.738 --> 03:38.652
I know. That's why I'm here.
Could you come with me for a minute?

03:39.618 --> 03:43.402
- Come with you where?
- To the main conference room.

03:45.707 --> 03:48.198
What's going on, Mike?

03:48.293 --> 03:52.160
Please, Mr President, come with me.

03:53.715 --> 03:57.049
You're ordering me
to the conference room?

03:57.135 --> 04:00.421
No, sir, of course not. I'm sorry.

04:00.514 --> 04:05.591
I'm... asking. It's very important, sir.

04:07.854 --> 04:11.804
Mike, I'm the President
of the United States.

04:11.900 --> 04:16.608
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me what this is about.

04:16.696 --> 04:18.772
Mr President...

04:19.866 --> 04:24.575
it seems there are a number
of people, cabinet members,

04:24.663 --> 04:30.499
who question whether you're fit to continue
as chief executive of this country.

04:38.593 --> 04:42.176
And these people are
in my conference room?

04:42.264 --> 04:45.597
In a manner of speaking, sir, they are.

04:47.185 --> 04:49.261
Then let's go see them.

05:08.290 --> 05:09.867
Mr President.

05:18.175 --> 05:22.552
So now I see why I had such a hard time
reaching you today, Jim.

05:23.889 --> 05:26.558
You were busy.

05:26.641 --> 05:30.260
I apologise if this comes
as a surprise, Mr President.

05:30.353 --> 05:33.687
This is a unique situation
in the history of our country,

05:33.774 --> 05:36.265
calling for unique measures.

05:36.359 --> 05:39.811
Let's skip the sound bites
and cut to the chase.

05:39.905 --> 05:42.609
What's going on here?

05:42.699 --> 05:45.902
Mr President, we are invoking
the 25th Amendment.

05:51.166 --> 05:53.289
Who's "we"?

05:54.085 --> 05:57.336
There's a general feeling that
the decisions made today...

05:57.422 --> 06:00.044
Hold on a minute, Mr Vice President.

06:00.133 --> 06:05.210
With all due respect, sir,
most of us here are scrambling

06:05.305 --> 06:07.594
just to understand today's events.

06:07.682 --> 06:13.436
I think it's way too early to be referring
to a "general feeling" about anything.

06:13.522 --> 06:15.313
Fair enough. For the record,

06:15.398 --> 06:18.933
let me review the relevant portions
of the 25th Amendment.

06:19.027 --> 06:21.700
Section 4 states whenever
the vice president...

06:21.800 --> 06:24.484
and the majority of the cabinet
determine that the president is unable

06:24.574 --> 06:27.778
to discharge the powers
and duties of his office,

06:27.869 --> 06:32.578
the vice president shall take office
as acting president. Everyone clear?

06:32.666 --> 06:35.536
The 25th Amendment was
designed for situations

06:35.627 --> 06:38.794
where the president is ill or incapacitated.

06:38.880 --> 06:43.341
"Unable to discharge the powers
and duties of his office."

06:43.427 --> 06:46.842
The reason for the disability
isn't limited to any cause.

06:46.930 --> 06:50.097
The Attorney General agrees
with this interpretation.

06:50.183 --> 06:54.098
And just what exactly is
my supposed disability?

06:54.187 --> 07:00.308
It seems clear to me that the stress of
today's events has overwhelmed you.

07:00.402 --> 07:04.731
An atomic device has been
detonated on American soil today.

07:04.823 --> 07:08.156
We have clear evidence
which countries are responsible,

07:08.243 --> 07:12.905
along with details of
the terrorist group they sponsor.

07:14.249 --> 07:20.168
The evidence implicating these countries
is not clear, Mr Prescott. Far from it.

07:20.255 --> 07:25.250
The Cyprus audio has been independently
verified by every intelligence group we have.

07:25.343 --> 07:27.834
I have reason to believe they are mistaken.

07:27.929 --> 07:31.464
Because of this lone CTU agent, Jack Bauer?

07:32.517 --> 07:37.938
Yes. Mr Bauer believes that
the Cyprus audio is a forgery.

07:38.023 --> 07:40.596
He also believes that he
will soon have proof.

07:40.692 --> 07:46.362
He's been telling you that for hours,
Mr President. You still don't have proof.

07:48.992 --> 07:51.364
If military strikes do not go ahead,

07:51.453 --> 07:56.696
casualties to American soldiers would
increase by tens of thousands of lives.

07:56.792 --> 07:58.665
That analysis is undisputed.

07:58.752 --> 08:03.248
The risk of attacking innocent countries
is unacceptable. We have to be sure.

08:03.340 --> 08:07.717
Everybody is sure, Mr President.
Everybody but you.

08:07.803 --> 08:09.961
As it happens, I'm the only who counts.

08:13.809 --> 08:15.766
This meeting is over.

08:15.852 --> 08:20.265
Mr President, one way or another,
there will be a vote.

08:20.357 --> 08:24.224
I think that you should be heard
before that vote is taken.

08:33.662 --> 08:36.331
You don't like one of my policy decisions.

08:36.414 --> 08:42.001
You do not have the right to reverse that
policy under the pretence that I'm disabled.

08:42.087 --> 08:45.254
Mr President, I agree.

08:45.340 --> 08:49.753
I intend to show a pattern of erratic
and irrational behaviour on your part

08:49.845 --> 08:52.051
since the start of this crisis.

08:52.139 --> 08:55.175
In that light, your refusal
to authorise military action

08:55.267 --> 08:58.102
is simply another symptom of disability.

08:58.186 --> 09:01.140
Listen to me. All of you.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.021
I know you're not in the same room with me.

09:08.488 --> 09:11.323
But you can see and hear me plainly enough.

09:11.408 --> 09:13.484
Take a good look.

09:14.828 --> 09:16.904
Do I seem scared?

09:18.748 --> 09:21.500
Am I breaking into a nervous sweat?

09:21.585 --> 09:24.336
Am I babbling? At a loss for words?

09:24.421 --> 09:26.746
Is my voice shaking?

09:29.718 --> 09:33.466
Can any one of you look me in the eye
and tell me I'm disabled?

09:38.226 --> 09:44.312
Mr President, the issue is not your
demeanour over the past few minutes,

09:44.399 --> 09:48.148
but your actions over the past 20 hours.

09:48.236 --> 09:53.444
Mr President, the vice president
has raised serious questions

09:53.533 --> 09:57.068
and, in my opinion, it would
be a mistake to ignore them.

09:57.162 --> 10:02.868
For my part, I'm confident that if you explain
yourself with your usual candour and clarity,

10:02.959 --> 10:08.665
all questions will be resolved
to the satisfaction of everyone here.

10:15.013 --> 10:20.968
Mr Prescott, there seems to be a collective
feeling that a discussion is called for.

10:21.061 --> 10:24.809
In the interest of putting this
behind us, I'll agree.

10:26.233 --> 10:32.485
On one condition:
when it's over, if I'm supported,

10:34.074 --> 10:38.024
you tender your resignation as
the vice president of this country.

10:42.749 --> 10:46.498
Very well, Mr President. I agree.

10:49.840 --> 10:53.540
I suggest we all take a few minutes
to compose ourselves

10:53.635 --> 10:57.882
and get on with the proceeding.

10:57.973 --> 11:03.809
Let's not mince words, Mr Secretary.
You mean the trial of David Palmer.

11:23.957 --> 11:28.536
All right, the problem is that
they don't correspond. I need them to.

11:28.628 --> 11:31.546
Ryan, could I have a word with you, please?

11:31.631 --> 11:33.707
Give me a minute.

11:35.302 --> 11:39.596
I just got a message that the president
called off the military offensive.

11:39.681 --> 11:42.386
- Who told you this?
- Someone at DOJ.

11:43.226 --> 11:46.975
- Someone I trust.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

11:48.273 --> 11:50.349
Is it true?

11:50.442 --> 11:52.185
- Yes.
- And you knew about it.

11:52.277 --> 11:54.946
- I did.
- And you didn't tell me.

11:55.030 --> 11:58.613
Why keep my people processing
intel on a scrapped operation?

11:58.700 --> 12:04.157
Because there's a strong possibility
the White House will reinstate the attack.

12:04.247 --> 12:08.459
It doesn't make sense. Why would
the president reverse his orders twice?

12:08.543 --> 12:11.912
Just keep your people on a war footing.

12:16.635 --> 12:20.253
Tony, phones are up.
I got Jack Bauer on line two.

12:20.347 --> 12:22.470
- Where is he?
- Kate's house.

12:22.557 --> 12:25.344
- Why?
- I don't know, but he has the chip.

12:25.435 --> 12:27.724
Conference-call him to my office.

12:42.410 --> 12:46.788
Why are you at Kate's house?
You were supposed to bring that chip here.

12:46.873 --> 12:50.289
We ran into some interference.
Yusuf Auda is dead.

12:50.377 --> 12:52.453
- What happened?
- No time to explain.

12:52.546 --> 12:56.294
He's the only reason we still got this chip.
I'm trying to read it now.

12:56.383 --> 12:59.218
I tried a flash card adapter,
but it's not working.

12:59.302 --> 13:04.260
You may be able to override the reader
function manually. I'll talk you through it.

13:04.349 --> 13:10.850
Good. Tony, while she's setting up,
run a background check on Peter Kingsley.

13:10.939 --> 13:16.313
It may be an alias. Cross-reference it
with every major player in the oil industry.

13:16.403 --> 13:18.858
- Peter Kingsley. Why?
- I'll explain later.

13:18.947 --> 13:22.363
First tell the president that
we've got the evidence he needs.

13:22.451 --> 13:26.116
I told him. I found out he's
called off the military strikes.

13:26.204 --> 13:27.533
Then we've got time.

13:27.622 --> 13:31.157
Not necessarily.
Chappelle said the order may be reversed.

13:31.251 --> 13:32.449
Why?

13:32.544 --> 13:35.296
He didn't get specific,
but something's going on

13:35.380 --> 13:38.666
in Washington that
we're not supposed to know about.

13:41.136 --> 13:44.256
- Michelle, are you ready for me?
- Yeah.

13:46.349 --> 13:48.472
I've asked someone to join us.

14:00.197 --> 14:02.522
Most of you know Ron Wieland.

14:02.616 --> 14:06.281
Ron is a highly respected
national affairs correspondent.

14:06.369 --> 14:11.364
He had a very interesting
experience earlier today. Ron?

14:12.501 --> 14:17.412
I was covering Mr Palmer's environmental
speech when I began to sense a bigger story.

14:17.506 --> 14:22.583
There were rumours of a terrorist attack on
the West Coast, involving a nuclear device.

14:22.677 --> 14:28.016
I kept asking questions. Next thing I know,
I was called in to talk to the president.

14:28.100 --> 14:34.102
He asked me to keep the story under wraps
until later, then he'd give me an exclusive.

14:34.189 --> 14:36.941
- What did you say?
- That I'd think it over.

14:37.025 --> 14:41.604
As I was leaving, a secret service agent
grabbed me and hustled me into a room.

14:41.696 --> 14:45.112
I was kept there under guard
for several hours.

14:45.200 --> 14:50.787
Did you feel this was a violation of your
rights as a journalist and an American?

14:50.872 --> 14:51.786
Of course.

14:51.873 --> 14:56.998
- Ron, were you harmed or threatened?
- No, sir.

14:57.504 --> 15:01.454
Did you understand the reason
for your being detained?

15:01.550 --> 15:07.802
I assume it was fear that if word got out
of a nuclear threat, panic would strike.

15:09.975 --> 15:13.807
Do you think the lives of thousands
of citizens is less important

15:13.895 --> 15:18.391
than a couple of hours of
your First Amendment rights?

15:20.444 --> 15:23.065
No, I don't. But under the Bill of Rights,

15:23.155 --> 15:27.318
that decision was mine,
not yours, Mr President.

15:29.035 --> 15:33.697
Did you feel that things were out of control
in the Palmer administration?

15:33.790 --> 15:35.949
You're putting words in his mouth.

15:37.043 --> 15:40.495
I did have a sense the president
Palmer was not in control.

15:40.589 --> 15:46.876
I was trying to balance the need for public
safety against Ron Wieland's rights.

15:46.970 --> 15:50.802
I offered Ron a deal, and he turned me down.

15:52.267 --> 15:58.934
Nothing was out of control. I might add,
I had legal precedent for my action.

16:00.442 --> 16:02.518
Thank you, Mr Wieland.

16:04.404 --> 16:09.481
I'd like to call someone else to testify.
He should be ready in a few moments.

16:12.162 --> 16:15.994
Control CX-5, then hit "enter".

16:16.958 --> 16:18.702
- Done.
- Anything?

16:18.794 --> 16:23.290
I think it's reading it... No, all I'm
getting are numbers and symbols.

16:23.381 --> 16:26.667
Take out the chip.
Make sure the leads are exposed.

16:34.768 --> 16:36.891
- Damn it!
- What is it?

16:36.978 --> 16:39.137
- The chip is damaged.
- How badly?

16:39.231 --> 16:43.311
Part of the microprocessor is gone
and the leads connected to it.

16:43.401 --> 16:47.482
Send me any data you have
to run through our retrieval program.

16:47.572 --> 16:49.980
Can you access a complete audio file?

16:50.075 --> 16:53.278
If it's on there, I'll find it.

16:54.121 --> 16:55.947
- IT.
- This is Almeida.

16:56.039 --> 16:59.740
- Send two guys up here.
- They're all doing MI for Chappelle.

16:59.835 --> 17:02.539
I don't care. I need two IT people now.

17:02.629 --> 17:06.045
- Chappelle specifically...
- Just do it. I gotta go.

17:06.133 --> 17:07.330
Almeida.

17:07.968 --> 17:13.472
Tony, hi, it's Kim. Look, I haven't been
able to reach my dad. Is he available?

17:13.557 --> 17:17.175
We're in the middle of something important.
Can he call you back?

17:17.269 --> 17:20.104
Tony, please. It'll just take a minute.

17:20.188 --> 17:22.644
OK. OK, just hold on.

17:29.364 --> 17:30.609
Are you getting it?

17:30.699 --> 17:35.028
Yeah, I got it, but you were right -
the data is pretty screwed.

17:35.120 --> 17:38.240
Jack, I've assigned two IT
people to help Michelle.

17:38.331 --> 17:40.657
We should get through it in 15, 20 minutes.

17:40.750 --> 17:43.917
- OK, good.
- Also, I got Kim on the line for you.

17:44.671 --> 17:46.462
Thank you, Tony.

17:47.883 --> 17:50.587
Kim, I got your dad on the line. Go ahead.

17:50.677 --> 17:52.717
- Dad?
- Sweetheart.

17:53.805 --> 17:57.470
- I've been trying to reach you.
- Are you at the sheriffs station?

17:57.559 --> 18:02.304
They're taking me to the Mathesons' house
to pack up my things.

18:02.397 --> 18:04.473
Glad you're OK.

18:05.358 --> 18:07.481
Me too.

18:07.569 --> 18:10.142
When I thought you were gone, I...

18:11.573 --> 18:15.405
I just miss you, Dad. I miss you so much.

18:15.494 --> 18:17.866
I've missed you too, honey.

18:18.580 --> 18:21.118
I just wanna come home.

18:21.958 --> 18:25.208
You'll be home soon enough, I promise, OK?

18:26.254 --> 18:28.959
OK. Hey, Dad?

18:29.049 --> 18:31.622
- Yeah?
- I love you.

18:35.514 --> 18:38.005
I love you too, baby.

18:38.934 --> 18:41.010
I'll see you soon, OK?

18:41.937 --> 18:43.597
Bye.

19:10.298 --> 19:14.296
You knew about this, didn't you, Mike?
How long have you known?

19:14.386 --> 19:17.671
- That doesn't matter, Mr Palmer.
- It matters to me.

19:17.764 --> 19:19.840
How long?

19:20.725 --> 19:22.967
A couple of hours.

19:34.114 --> 19:36.901
You were part of it, weren't you?

19:39.244 --> 19:43.705
When all's said and done...
you were on Prescott's side.

19:44.416 --> 19:45.416
No, sir.

19:46.116 --> 19:49.956
I'm on your side and always will be.

19:52.424 --> 19:54.915
This could be a good thing.

19:55.010 --> 19:58.924
A chance to correct a mistake
of historic proportion.

19:59.014 --> 20:05.182
David, I'm begging you,
reconsider your position on this.

20:11.651 --> 20:13.727
I'm the president, Mike.

20:15.697 --> 20:18.318
You don't call me by my first name.

20:21.036 --> 20:22.495
Yes, sir.

20:42.224 --> 20:43.801
It's transmitting.

20:45.811 --> 20:48.646
Gentlemen, I'm sorry for the delay.

20:48.730 --> 20:52.229
The man you're about to see
is not entirely well.

20:52.317 --> 20:56.231
In fact, it's taken a great deal of
courage for him to join us at all.

20:56.321 --> 21:00.188
Roger Stanton, head of
the National Security Agency.

21:00.283 --> 21:02.656
Roger, thank you for speaking with us.

21:02.744 --> 21:06.789
Yes, of course. Sorry if I seem a bit tired.

21:06.873 --> 21:10.456
I was tortured for several hours
at the operations complex,

21:10.544 --> 21:13.794
by order of the President
of the United States.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.707
And why were you tortured?

21:15.799 --> 21:21.138
Because you thought I knew more than I
was saying about the location of the bomb.

21:21.221 --> 21:25.634
As if the head of NSA would withhold
information from the president.

21:25.725 --> 21:30.352
You're lying. This may work for a while,
but eventually the truth will come out.

21:30.439 --> 21:33.439
I have nothing to fear
from the truth, Mr President.

21:33.525 --> 21:38.816
As briefly as possible, Mr Stanton,
tell us what happened to you today.

21:38.905 --> 21:44.576
I arrived at the OC around noon to find
that my assistant director, Eric Rayburn,

21:44.661 --> 21:46.867
had been dismissed by the president.

21:46.955 --> 21:49.909
What was the reason given
for Mr Rayburn's firing?

21:50.000 --> 21:55.540
Eric wanted to bring the military into
the equation right away, and the president

21:55.630 --> 22:01.918
was reluctant to even contemplate
the use of military action.

22:02.012 --> 22:03.210
That's not true.

22:03.305 --> 22:07.089
For the next few hours, I worked
for the president as best I could.

22:07.184 --> 22:12.178
He was indecisive, erratic and, as I said,

22:13.732 --> 22:17.812
terrified to even think
of military engagement.

22:18.820 --> 22:23.482
A little after six this evening,
I was arrested on the charge of treason.

22:24.493 --> 22:27.659
I was taken to a small windowless room.

22:27.746 --> 22:32.538
The president accused me of knowing
more about the bomb than I was telling him.

22:32.626 --> 22:36.540
- Was that true?
- No, of course not.

22:36.630 --> 22:41.541
In fairness to the president, I think
he genuinely believed it to be true.

22:41.635 --> 22:43.758
Why would he hold such a belief?

22:45.806 --> 22:48.593
David Palmer is a decent man.

22:48.683 --> 22:52.515
Maybe he's too decent
for the times we live in.

22:53.355 --> 22:56.439
He wanted to avoid war at any cost.

22:56.525 --> 23:01.068
If he could prove to himself that
Americans were behind the bomb,

23:01.154 --> 23:07.275
then he'd have a good reason not to use
military force against any foreign country.

23:12.374 --> 23:15.825
I just heard you ordered two ITs
onto a retrieval project.

23:15.919 --> 23:18.125
They were working military intel.

23:18.213 --> 23:19.873
Jack Bauer has a chip.

23:19.965 --> 23:25.090
It contains an audio file that we expect
will prove the Cyprus audio was forged.

23:26.388 --> 23:28.464
Where is this chip?

23:28.557 --> 23:30.964
- It's been damaged.
- Damaged?

23:31.059 --> 23:33.099
The data Jack sent us is messed up.

23:33.186 --> 23:36.520
The audio file has to be
reconstituted. That takes time.

23:36.606 --> 23:40.058
- How long?
- However long it takes.

23:40.152 --> 23:42.643
It should take about 15 minutes, sir.

23:50.620 --> 23:52.328
Mr Chappelle's office.

23:52.414 --> 23:55.949
- Get a message to the vice president.
- Right away, sir.

24:20.901 --> 24:24.270
Ready to tell me
everything I need to know?

24:25.822 --> 24:27.898
Continue.

24:30.494 --> 24:33.779
We knew about the bomb weeks ago.

24:33.872 --> 24:35.948
Enough!

24:36.416 --> 24:40.496
This should end this discussion
here and now.

24:40.587 --> 24:44.288
Yes, I had Roger Stanton tortured.

24:44.382 --> 24:47.716
It was a horrible thing to do.
God knows I hated doing it.

24:47.803 --> 24:51.136
But just as I suspected,
he knew about the bomb.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.096
You've just seen that.

24:53.183 --> 24:55.674
When I was strapped to a chair

24:55.769 --> 25:01.558
and thousands of volts of electric current
passed through my body every few seconds,

25:01.650 --> 25:02.948
I'm not proud of it,

25:03.848 --> 25:07.237
but I dare say I did what most of
you would've done - I cracked.

25:07.322 --> 25:12.364
Told the president what he wanted
to hear, that I knew about the bomb.

25:12.452 --> 25:16.070
You told me more than that.
You told me about the Coral Snake team.

25:16.164 --> 25:21.206
You told me that the bomb was at Norton
Airfield, information that we corroborated.

25:21.294 --> 25:24.165
I don't know what you're talking about.

25:24.256 --> 25:27.589
Mr Prescott, play the rest of the tape.

25:27.676 --> 25:30.593
There is no rest of the tape.

25:30.679 --> 25:32.921
- What?
- That's all I have.

25:33.014 --> 25:36.549
That can't be. I was in that room
for another ten minutes.

25:36.643 --> 25:41.139
This is all that was transmitted by the OC.
We did ask for everything.

25:41.231 --> 25:44.600
There must be a mistake,
or deliberate sabotage.

25:44.693 --> 25:48.691
Mr Stanton had a lot more to say
than what you just saw.

25:48.780 --> 25:53.572
Mr President, couldn't Agent Simmons
verify what you've been telling us?

25:53.660 --> 25:57.195
No. I sent him out of the room.

25:57.706 --> 26:03.329
But the fact remains that Roger Stanton
told me about the Coral Snake team

26:03.420 --> 26:07.797
and the location of the bomb. Where else
could that information have come from?

26:07.883 --> 26:11.168
We have many intelligence
agencies, Mr President,

26:11.261 --> 26:13.669
thousands of agents combing the planet.

26:13.764 --> 26:17.263
It could've come from anywhere.
I know it didn't come from me.

26:17.350 --> 26:20.351
That's a lie and you know it.
Tell them, Mike.

26:25.150 --> 26:28.067
I only know what the president told me.

26:29.821 --> 26:31.861
I wasn't in the room.

26:34.117 --> 26:35.777
Mr Stanton, thank you again.

26:35.869 --> 26:40.578
You will remain in custody as the president
has ordered until this matter is resolved.

26:40.665 --> 26:41.910
I understand.

26:43.043 --> 26:48.001
Mr President, if you have any evidence
you'd like to present, please do so now.

26:48.089 --> 26:53.843
The testimony that's been presented here
so far is inaccurate and incomplete.

26:53.929 --> 26:58.923
Roger Stanton is directly responsible
for placing a nuclear weapon on US soil.

26:59.017 --> 27:02.718
I have evidence that proves it,
but you've given me no time.

27:04.314 --> 27:07.765
While my behaviour may have been extreme,

27:07.859 --> 27:12.320
I was just responding to
the extremity of today's events.

27:12.405 --> 27:18.942
Make no mistake. If we unleash our military
power on nations that later prove innocent,

27:19.037 --> 27:23.201
it will rank as one of the most
despicable sneak attacks in history.

27:23.291 --> 27:26.495
Any chance for peace in the Middle East
will vanish forever.

27:26.586 --> 27:30.205
Even if it costs American
lives in the future,

27:30.298 --> 27:34.047
we must delay the attack
until we are certain of our ground.

27:34.136 --> 27:35.215
Excuse me.

27:35.303 --> 27:40.049
I just received an urgent message
from CTU division chief Ryan Chappelle.

27:40.142 --> 27:46.595
Jack Bauer has evidence he claims
will prove the Cyprus audio was forged.

27:46.690 --> 27:49.810
Please, everyone... Shh.
Please settle down.

27:49.901 --> 27:52.736
The evidence is being reviewed at CTU now.

27:52.821 --> 27:57.483
Mr Chappelle says that the analysis shall
be complete within the next few minutes.

27:57.576 --> 28:02.570
Considering the impact that this evidence
will have on these proceedings,

28:02.664 --> 28:06.080
I think it's incumbent upon us to wait.

28:09.421 --> 28:13.253
- I'm looking at it right now.
- We can't configure it, either.

28:13.341 --> 28:16.876
- Did you run it through default mode?
- The audio files are gone.

28:16.970 --> 28:19.342
They're just some markers that repeat.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.100
- Thanks, Jason.
- All right.

28:22.809 --> 28:25.810
He didn't find anything, either.

28:26.980 --> 28:29.269
Well, what have you got?

28:29.357 --> 28:31.931
The chip was more compromised
than we thought.

28:32.027 --> 28:36.570
- Do you have the audio file?
- Michelle recovered some information.

28:36.656 --> 28:38.945
It may tell us who programmed it.

28:39.034 --> 28:42.237
Did you find the audio file?
That's all I need to know.

28:44.372 --> 28:45.915
No, we didn't.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.415
So... Bauer wasted our time.

29:10.732 --> 29:12.725
Come on.

29:24.329 --> 29:26.405
Kate?

29:28.625 --> 29:30.701
Kate, are you all right?

29:32.671 --> 29:38.839
Everything that's happened today,
everything that's still happening...

29:39.928 --> 29:43.214
I keep thinking it's all my fault.

29:43.306 --> 29:48.763
Come here. We would never have found
the bomb in time if it wasn't for you.

29:49.604 --> 29:53.223
My sister was the one behind the bomb.
She helped those fanatics.

29:53.316 --> 29:56.234
Yes. But you're not your sister.

29:57.779 --> 30:01.729
I should've seen something
was wrong before it got this bad.

30:01.825 --> 30:06.202
Because of what she did,
it could start a war.

30:06.288 --> 30:08.115
I could've stopped it.

30:08.206 --> 30:10.329
No, Kate, you couldn't have.

30:10.959 --> 30:14.328
There are things in this world
that are out of our control.

30:14.421 --> 30:19.249
Sometimes we blame ourselves for them
so that we can try and make sense out of it.

30:23.054 --> 30:25.130
Come here.

30:31.813 --> 30:34.933
There was nothing you could have done.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.873
Sorry. Yeah?

30:53.960 --> 30:55.336
It's Tony and Michelle.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.662
Excuse me.

30:57.756 --> 30:59.795
- You got the audio file?
- No.

30:59.883 --> 31:03.881
What do you mean? Are you saying
there's no audio file on that chip?

31:03.970 --> 31:06.508
If there were, they were destroyed.

31:06.598 --> 31:09.006
Chappelle wants you in
on a call to the president.

31:09.101 --> 31:10.974
Yeah, I bet he does.

31:11.061 --> 31:15.438
Some of the information Michelle
recovered may be worth looking into.

31:15.524 --> 31:16.686
What information?

31:16.775 --> 31:19.692
Identical code fragments
in several data streams.

31:19.778 --> 31:23.858
- What are the fragments for?
- Nothing. That's the point.

31:23.949 --> 31:29.619
It's junk code. Programmers sometimes
embed it into their programs as a signature.

31:29.704 --> 31:33.287
Michelle traced the sequence
to a hacker named Alex Hewitt.

31:33.375 --> 31:35.451
He's got a file with the FBI.

31:35.544 --> 31:39.292
You think this is the technician
that created the Cyprus audio?

31:39.381 --> 31:40.163
Yes.

31:40.257 --> 31:44.005
We can't follow up any more leads,
so you have to talk to this guy.

31:44.094 --> 31:46.051
What's his last known address?

31:46.138 --> 31:50.431
210 Laurel Canyon Boulevard,
North Hollywood.

31:51.101 --> 31:52.975
I got it. I'll get back to you.

31:53.061 --> 31:55.137
All right.

31:57.816 --> 32:00.141
- I'm sorry. I've gotta go.
- Where?

32:00.235 --> 32:06.439
We got something off the chip,
not what we're looking for, but it's a lead.

32:06.533 --> 32:13.247
When you're ready, an officer will take you
back to CTU so you can be with your father.

32:13.331 --> 32:15.704
Thanks.

32:19.963 --> 32:22.039
OK.

32:23.383 --> 32:25.589
- Jack?
- Yeah?

32:29.639 --> 32:31.881
Be careful.

32:31.975 --> 32:35.059
Thanks. I will be.

32:43.779 --> 32:48.524
Squadrons have been in a holding pattern
since the president called off the attack.

32:48.617 --> 32:50.526
They just refuelled.

32:50.619 --> 32:55.281
If we want to resume the operation,
we need to come to a conclusion now.

32:55.373 --> 33:00.748
A few more minutes. This is the difference
between peace and war, Mr Prescott.

33:00.837 --> 33:05.298
It's also a pattern that's been recurring
over the last few hours.

33:05.383 --> 33:10.176
Everything will change once Mr Bauer calls.
It just never quite happens.

33:16.311 --> 33:18.387
- Yes, what?
- CTU.

33:20.941 --> 33:23.728
Jack Bauer and Ryan Chappelle
are on the line.

33:25.445 --> 33:28.482
- This is President Palmer.
- This is Ryan Chappelle.

33:28.573 --> 33:31.064
- Hello.
- Jack Bauer is on the line as well.

33:31.159 --> 33:33.733
He'll give you an update.

33:33.829 --> 33:39.368
Mr President, I found the chip.
Unfortunately, it's been badly damaged.

33:39.459 --> 33:42.745
Can it prove that the Cyprus
recording was forged?

33:42.838 --> 33:46.171
In its present condition, it proves nothing.

33:46.258 --> 33:50.421
- Can it be repaired?
- No, sir. But about an hour ago,

33:50.512 --> 33:53.050
I was tortured by men who wanted the chip.

33:53.140 --> 33:57.848
They worked for Peter Kingsley.
He's part of the group behind the bomb.

33:57.936 --> 34:01.139
They've manipulated
today's events to start this war.

34:01.231 --> 34:02.394
What?

34:02.482 --> 34:05.234
To improve their oil contracts
in the Caspian Sea

34:05.318 --> 34:09.482
and to control the oil
coming out of the Middle East.

34:09.989 --> 34:12.065
I need something concrete, evidence.

34:12.159 --> 34:15.195
I understand. I'm checking up
on an address of a man

34:15.286 --> 34:20.873
who we believe engineered the recording
for Kingsley. It's the best we've got.

34:22.168 --> 34:24.208
Everything you've seen,

34:24.295 --> 34:28.043
are you absolutely convinced
the Cyprus recording was forged?

34:28.132 --> 34:29.876
Yes, sir, absolutely.

34:33.096 --> 34:36.050
All right, Jack. Thank you.

34:41.605 --> 34:47.275
The evidence I was hoping for is not yet
available, but I believe it will be soon.

34:47.360 --> 34:51.572
- When, Mr President?
- I don't know.

34:51.656 --> 34:55.654
Meanwhile, the window for
a surprise attack is rapidly closing.

34:57.579 --> 34:59.488
It's time to vote.

34:59.581 --> 35:03.994
Mr Vice President, if you could
indulge me for one minute.

35:04.878 --> 35:06.954
Mr President.

35:09.090 --> 35:12.175
This Bauer thing is an illusion, a mirage.

35:12.260 --> 35:15.345
Every time you get near it,
it moves further away.

35:15.430 --> 35:20.804
For your sake, for the country's,
authorise the attack.

35:20.894 --> 35:23.385
All this will just go away.

35:23.480 --> 35:28.474
And a lot of people, Americans and
non-Americans, will die for no reason.

35:28.568 --> 35:31.059
We don't know that, Mr President.

35:34.407 --> 35:37.112
Let's get on with the vote.

35:38.662 --> 35:43.573
Members of the cabinet, you've
been presented with the evidence.

35:43.667 --> 35:45.706
You know what's at stake.

35:45.794 --> 35:51.666
Those of you who believe the president
is able to continue in office, vote yes.

35:51.758 --> 35:55.376
Those of you who believe he isn't, vote no.

35:56.555 --> 35:58.761
Mr Novick will conduct a voice poll.

35:58.849 --> 36:01.553
The numbers will be reflected on the screen.

36:01.643 --> 36:03.719
Mr Novick?

36:04.688 --> 36:08.638
Ms Secretary of Transportation,
how do you vote?

36:08.733 --> 36:09.765
Yes.

36:14.531 --> 36:16.737
Mr Secretary of Treasury?

36:17.617 --> 36:18.649
No.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.502
Yes.

36:41.850 --> 36:43.225
- Almeida.
- It's Jack.

36:43.310 --> 36:48.268
I'm half a block from Hewitt's loft.
Has the FBI sent over his file yet?

36:48.356 --> 36:50.396
- Yeah.
- What do I need to know?

36:50.484 --> 36:55.905
The State Department recruited him. He
revamped their entire surveillance program.

36:55.989 --> 36:59.738
He got caught manipulating files
that he didn't have clearance for.

36:59.826 --> 37:03.112
He tried to kill himself,
spent a year in psychiatric prison,

37:03.205 --> 37:05.078
then was released last September.

37:05.165 --> 37:08.949
- No connection to Kingsley?
- No, not that we can find.

37:09.878 --> 37:12.451
As soon as I get Hewitt,
I'll get back to you.

37:12.547 --> 37:15.548
Any word on what's happening
with the president?

37:15.634 --> 37:19.085
- No, not yet.
- OK, thanks.

37:21.431 --> 37:24.847
Mr Secretary of Defence, how do you vote?

37:24.935 --> 37:28.220
Yes, I believe the president
should stay in office.

37:36.738 --> 37:38.814
Mr Secretary of Agriculture.

37:46.790 --> 37:48.165
No.

37:55.966 --> 37:58.539
Mr Secretary of the Interior.

38:06.143 --> 38:07.685
No.

38:11.189 --> 38:16.978
Mr Secretary of State, the vote
is seven for and seven against.

38:17.070 --> 38:20.938
- Yours is the deciding vote.
- I'm aware of that.

38:26.371 --> 38:32.955
I've never met a man that I respected
more than you, Mr President. Never.

38:39.634 --> 38:45.470
But we are talking about tens
of thousands of American lives.

38:49.811 --> 38:52.136
I'm compelled to vote no.

39:17.756 --> 39:21.089
Mr President, can you see the results?

39:22.344 --> 39:27.385
You will have an opportunity to appeal this
in four days in front of Congress.

39:27.474 --> 39:34.390
In the meantime, I must ask you to remove
yourself from the decision-making process.

39:35.398 --> 39:38.020
Please take the president to a holding room.

39:50.455 --> 39:53.789
Will you please come with us, Mr President?

40:16.148 --> 40:21.189
Mr President... I'm not a lawyer, sir,

40:21.278 --> 40:25.062
but as far as I can tell,
the Constitution's been followed.

40:25.157 --> 40:29.024
I've got no choice but to
ask you to come with us.

40:30.078 --> 40:32.154
I'm sorry, sir.

41:57.499 --> 42:00.120
I do solemnly swear that
I will faithfully execute

42:00.210 --> 42:04.955
the office of the President of the United
States and will, to the best of my ability,

42:05.048 --> 42:09.509
preserve, protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States,

42:09.594 --> 42:11.670
so help me God.

42:40.834 --> 42:42.910
Come on.

43:21.833 --> 43:23.909
Alex?
