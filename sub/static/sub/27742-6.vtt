WEBVTT

00:01.549 --> 00:05.922
Hm. Hey man.
I found a hornet's nest in the backyard.

00:06.023 --> 00:08.023
I was gonna go swing a stick
at it and then run for my life.

00:08.125 --> 00:10.760
- You wanna join?
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:11.266 --> 00:12.829
Okay. Normal answer. What you got here?

00:12.930 --> 00:15.932
It's a letter from a literary
magazine I submitted to.

00:16.033 --> 00:18.835
- Good news?
- I haven't opened it yet.

00:18.936 --> 00:20.937
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm just a little nervous, 'cause...

00:21.038 --> 00:22.285
- Give me this!
- Oh! Mark, Mark, Mark... Mark!

00:22.374 --> 00:27.744
- I am going to read it. That's what I'm here for!
- Yeah, but what if it's bad?

00:27.845 --> 00:30.913
- What if it's bad? What if it's good? Hm?
- Yeah.

00:31.015 --> 00:33.583
For all you know, Andrew, they gave
you the centerfold of the damn thing.

00:33.684 --> 00:36.953
- Literary magazines don't have centerfolds.
- They don't? They should.

00:37.054 --> 00:39.789
Here we go. "Dear Mr. Tennesen."

00:39.890 --> 00:42.392
- That's a good start! That's a good start.
- Not bad, not bad.

00:42.493 --> 00:45.528
"We are writing regarding your short
story, A Tall Drink Of Winter...

00:47.768 --> 00:49.599
"We feel, given your numerous
past submissions,

00:49.700 --> 00:51.601
a detailed response is only fitting."

00:51.702 --> 00:53.803
How many times have you
submitted to these guys?

00:53.904 --> 00:57.173
- Thirty. Keep going.
- Alright. "You have achieved something very rare

00:57.274 --> 01:00.677
"with your latest story in
that it manages to be both

01:00.778 --> 01:04.113
technically inept and
artistically worthless."

01:04.214 --> 01:06.416
- Yeah, alright!
- Alright, let's just...

01:06.517 --> 01:08.651
"That you achieve both with
your weak chinned prose...

01:08.752 --> 01:10.787
- is no small feat of ineptitude."
- Mark, can you just...

01:10.888 --> 01:13.122
- Just give it to me!
- "Weak chinned prose." Hold on! There's way more!

01:18.670 --> 01:21.217
<i>Thank you for saving my son, Travel Dog.</i>

01:21.252 --> 01:23.450
- <i>And good luck to ye...</i>
- What is this?

01:23.485 --> 01:24.767
Is this <i>The Littlest Hobo?</i>

01:24.868 --> 01:26.769
<i>Travel Dog.</i> It's like <i>The Littlest Hobo</i>

01:26.870 --> 01:28.771
except the dog in this
one isn't neutered.

01:28.872 --> 01:30.712
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I see that now.

01:30.775 --> 01:33.109
He is really going to town, there.

01:33.210 --> 01:35.645
Great. Yikes. Okay, Andy,

01:35.746 --> 01:37.780
come on, pal. Let's go outside.
Let's go have some fun.

01:37.881 --> 01:39.782
- What is "fun"?
- Alright. Look at me.

01:39.883 --> 01:41.918
Look at me! Hey! Up here!

01:42.019 --> 01:45.221
There is a little saying I like
to quote when I get knocked down

01:45.322 --> 01:47.457
and it goes like this:
"I get knocked down,

01:47.558 --> 01:49.592
"but... I get up again

01:49.693 --> 01:51.794
'cause you are never
gonna keep me down."

01:52.741 --> 01:53.996
You know who said that, Andy?

01:54.932 --> 01:56.899
- Chumbawamba?
- Chumbawamba.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.268
In their 1997 opus, <i>Tubthumping.</i>

01:59.370 --> 02:01.237
A song about a young, presumably

02:01.338 --> 02:03.606
Irish lad named "Dany Boy",
who always got up

02:03.707 --> 02:05.208
after he'd been knocked down.

02:05.243 --> 02:08.625
Now that's what we're gonna do, Andy.
So let's get on our feet!

02:08.660 --> 02:11.080
- Let's get up again! Come on!
- No.

02:11.181 --> 02:13.483
Respect my boundaries, Mark!

02:13.584 --> 02:15.918
Respect your brother's
boundaries, Marky.

02:16.019 --> 02:18.254
- Fine...
- Is everything okay?

02:18.355 --> 02:20.089
Yeah. Andy's just being
a mopey piece of crap

02:20.190 --> 02:22.392
because his stupid short story
got rejected by some magazine.

02:22.493 --> 02:27.063
Oh! Well, there are two ways
of dealing with rejection.

02:27.164 --> 02:29.832
You can either sit and mope
about it all day 'til your soul

02:29.933 --> 02:32.235
shrivels inside you
like an old dead shrub,

02:32.336 --> 02:36.305
or... or you can kill yourself!

02:36.407 --> 02:38.040
That's it? Those are my two options?

02:38.142 --> 02:40.510
I always think a support
system is very important.

02:40.611 --> 02:43.179
I mean that's what I get from my coven.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.182
- I think we should get these goodies back.
- Ruth, before you leave,

02:46.283 --> 02:49.720
I heard the word coven. What about
some elaboration on that if possible?

02:49.755 --> 02:53.055
It's nothing too exciting.
It's just a 200-year-old

02:53.157 --> 02:57.260
pagan society that gets together
in their various moon phases

02:57.361 --> 02:59.780
to spend quality time together.

02:59.815 --> 03:02.432
- Bryn's a part of it.
- I blow the horn.

03:02.533 --> 03:04.667
Yeah. The summoning horn.

03:04.768 --> 03:07.737
Actually, tonight is her monthly esbat.

03:07.838 --> 03:09.672
That's witch speak for meeting.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.750
You're more than welcome to join us.
Might make you feel better.

03:12.785 --> 03:14.444
Oh. Thank you, Ruth,
but I think I'm just gonna

03:14.545 --> 03:16.601
- stay and watch...
- Now, that, that sounds wonderful, Ruth.

03:16.648 --> 03:20.583
- We will absolutely be there.
- That's the spirit, boys!

03:20.684 --> 03:23.352
Ah! Look! <i>Travel Dog!</i>

03:25.456 --> 03:27.890
I used to love this! Did you know

03:27.991 --> 03:30.092
this holds the record for
the most dog pregnancies

03:30.194 --> 03:33.896
- ever on set?
- Oh! That is fun!

03:36.400 --> 03:38.801
<i>- Bad dog! Bad!</i>
- This is great.

03:38.902 --> 03:42.004
Man, this town is light
on appropriate witch wear.

03:42.105 --> 03:44.373
What about this?
This is too sexy, right?

03:44.475 --> 03:46.576
You are not gonna fit in that.
Looks like an IUD.

03:46.677 --> 03:49.231
- I'll make it work.
- Why are we doing this?

03:49.266 --> 03:50.613
- Doing what?
- Hanging out with a bunch

03:50.714 --> 03:53.049
of middle-aged women
pretending to be witches?

03:53.150 --> 03:54.917
Are you kidding me, Andy?
This is gonna be awesome!

03:55.018 --> 03:57.687
How often do you get invited
to be part of a coven?

03:57.788 --> 04:00.022
Oh man, we get to slit
our palms into a goblet

04:00.123 --> 04:02.058
and make a wish for what
we truly want to Manon!

04:02.159 --> 04:04.660
What would you wish for,
Andy, from Manon?

04:04.761 --> 04:06.529
- Who's Manon?
- Who's Manon!

04:06.630 --> 04:08.531
Manon is the force that
controls all things

04:08.632 --> 04:11.067
in at least one teen witch movie.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.169
We have to be careful,
because he will take your peer group

04:13.270 --> 04:15.304
and split it apart faster
then you can... Yo!

04:15.405 --> 04:17.305
Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!
Shut up for a second.

04:17.406 --> 04:20.976
- You were talking.
- The hell is that?

04:26.116 --> 04:28.303
Woah!

04:28.463 --> 04:31.153
Oh! Where the hell
did this place come from?

04:32.286 --> 04:35.725
Some say it appeared out
of nowhere one night.

04:38.474 --> 04:40.997
Others say that we obtained
all the necessary permits

04:41.098 --> 04:43.499
and opened 2 weeks
after some quick renos.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.035
It used to be a Marvellous Muffins.
How may I help you?

04:46.136 --> 04:48.893
Well, we were recently
invited to join a coven

04:48.928 --> 04:52.675
and we were hoping to get
something to wear for our first "esbat".

04:52.776 --> 04:55.745
Oh... May I interest you in robes?

04:55.846 --> 04:59.448
- Oh, hell yeah! Now we're talking!
- We have many options.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.884
Full floor length for
the traditional witch.

05:01.985 --> 05:05.855
Knee length for the naughty witch.
And sheer

05:05.956 --> 05:09.659
for the witch who's looking
to turn up and horn down.

05:09.760 --> 05:13.195
I think traditional sounds good,
unless... Andy?

05:13.297 --> 05:15.131
Are you looking to
turn up and horn down?

05:15.232 --> 05:17.567
- Traditional's fine.
- Traditional then.

05:17.668 --> 05:19.802
- Would you like them wrapped?
- No, that's okay. We'll just wear them on outta here.

05:19.903 --> 05:23.339
I do have a question about this
curtain behind you. Seems to be housing

05:23.440 --> 05:27.376
something rather fun. Any chance
I could snag a peek back there?

05:27.477 --> 05:30.146
The things contained in that room
are not for the casual consumers.

05:30.247 --> 05:33.449
Therein lies a darkness you
could not possibly understand,

05:33.550 --> 05:37.053
you who appear to have
known no true suffering.

05:37.154 --> 05:39.155
Oh yeah. You know what? That is true.

05:39.256 --> 05:42.224
You, on the other hand,

05:42.326 --> 05:44.694
you are more than ready
to see what lies therein.

05:45.490 --> 05:49.031
It's clear you've suffered
much during your...

05:49.132 --> 05:51.267
I'm gonna say 45 years on this Earth.

05:51.368 --> 05:55.237
I'm 34! And I don't wanna see
what's in your stupid room.

05:55.339 --> 05:56.939
- Suit yourself.
- But take them off!

05:57.040 --> 05:59.909
Were you boys looking to pay cash...

06:00.010 --> 06:03.713
...or credit?

06:07.385 --> 06:08.417
I knew we shouldn't have worn these.

06:08.518 --> 06:10.453
- No one else is dressed up.
- We look good, man!

06:10.554 --> 06:12.455
You look good, I look amazing!

06:12.556 --> 06:14.957
- You look like a porno wizard.
- Yeah. Like I said,

06:15.058 --> 06:17.059
I look amazing. Anyway, don't worry.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.730
This is all just preamble.
Things are gonna get real weird

06:20.831 --> 06:23.633
- before long.
- Okay,

06:23.734 --> 06:26.335
everybody!
Thanks for coming to the esbat!

06:26.436 --> 06:29.972
Let's get this thing formally started.
Bryn, sweetie,

06:30.073 --> 06:32.241
want to skronk your horn?

06:37.648 --> 06:41.550
Terrific. Bring forth the quilt!

06:41.652 --> 06:43.686
Hey! What's gonna happen
with this guy later?

06:43.787 --> 06:46.989
Are we gonna sacrifice him or
sacrifice something to him?

06:47.090 --> 06:50.026
Oh no. Monty is my
emotional support snake.

06:50.127 --> 06:53.462
Having him nearby
helps me with my anxiety.

06:55.299 --> 06:56.098
Okay.

06:56.199 --> 06:59.001
That... That sucks.

06:59.102 --> 07:01.237
A little bit of housekeeping.
It's solstice this weekend.

07:01.338 --> 07:04.540
So we will be adding a new panel.

07:04.641 --> 07:07.910
Also it's a potluck so this time, let's
coordinate so we don't all bring deserts again.

07:08.388 --> 07:10.179
Thank you, ladies. Thank you.

07:10.280 --> 07:14.183
Now,
it's my favourite part of the night.

07:14.284 --> 07:17.119
I'd like to introduce one of
the newest members of our group,

07:17.220 --> 07:20.690
Andy Tennesen,
to come up and open our sharing circle

07:20.791 --> 07:23.559
with a few words about what
it was that brought him

07:23.660 --> 07:25.461
here, tonight. Andy!

07:25.562 --> 07:27.697
- I'm okay. Thanks. I'm alright.
- I'll speak, Ruth,

07:27.798 --> 07:29.699
if you want me to say some
kinda dark weird stuff.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.667
Oh no! I'd like to hear Andy.

07:31.768 --> 07:34.470
Come on, Andy. Give it a chance.
Might make you feel better.

07:34.571 --> 07:38.074
- Attaboy.
- Alright.

07:39.764 --> 07:42.144
I'm not usually...

07:42.245 --> 07:46.415
one to talk about myself
but I guess I'll give it a try.

07:46.516 --> 07:50.219
Ooh! It's been a rough day. Um...

07:50.320 --> 07:52.822
Actually,
it's been a rough couple of years.

07:54.172 --> 07:57.026
I'm trying to be a writer;

07:57.127 --> 07:59.628
But it seems like with
every new rejection,

07:59.730 --> 08:02.665
it's more and more of a pipe dream.

08:06.536 --> 08:10.639
I had so much to say. I just feel like

08:10.741 --> 08:14.877
the world doesn't
wanna listen sometimes.

08:14.978 --> 08:17.913
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

08:18.014 --> 08:20.649
- I'm sorry.
- It's alright. Just let it out!

08:20.751 --> 08:23.119
- I'm sorry...
- Let it out!

08:26.723 --> 08:29.725
Oh, God, this feels so good.
Oh, my God...

08:32.799 --> 08:34.663
How is this for a new vibe?

08:34.765 --> 08:35.839
You guys into this?

08:37.634 --> 08:40.469
Cut our hands open for Manon, hey?

08:40.570 --> 08:41.712
Manon!

08:43.000 --> 08:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:51.219 --> 08:52.588
- What you got there?
- Oh!

08:52.689 --> 08:55.290
Just making a little list of...
Well, have a seat. Have a seat.

08:55.392 --> 08:57.726
- I wanna run some stuff by you.
- Okay.

08:57.827 --> 08:59.762
So last night, huh! Oof!

08:59.863 --> 09:02.064
- What do you mean?
- Just the whole vibe, you know.

09:02.165 --> 09:05.434
Hanging out, hugging, eating cheese. Am I the
only one who searched witchcraft? Hello?

09:05.535 --> 09:07.603
So I compiled a bit of a list of things

09:07.704 --> 09:09.638
that I was going to propose
at the next meeting,

09:09.739 --> 09:13.175
just to see if we could all move
towards a more "coveney" direction

09:13.276 --> 09:16.478
in the future, so... number 1,
and this one seems obvious: More spells.

09:16.579 --> 09:18.347
- Any spells, really.
- Yeah...

09:18.448 --> 09:20.616
Number 2, movie night.
<i>Blair Witch, Witches of Eastwick...</i>

09:20.717 --> 09:24.321
If it's got witch in the title, it's probably
gonna take us in the right direction.

09:24.775 --> 09:26.355
- Number 3...
- I don't know, Mark.

09:26.456 --> 09:28.791
They've been running this
whole thing for 200 years.

09:28.892 --> 09:31.427
- Everyone seems happy.
- Yes, but is the point

09:31.528 --> 09:34.163
of a coven to be happy? That's sort of a
bigger picture question. Where are you headed?

09:34.264 --> 09:37.232
Oh, I'm actually headed to hang out
with some of the people from the coven.

09:37.333 --> 09:39.168
Oh! Great!
We can talk about these things there.

09:39.269 --> 09:41.170
Oh! Ah...

09:41.271 --> 09:43.539
They specifically asked
for me not to bring you.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.841
You kind of gave off a bit
of a weird vibe last night.

09:47.158 --> 09:48.177
- What?
- Well,

09:48.278 --> 09:51.180
you asked to sacrifice Deb's snake.
That's her pet.

09:51.281 --> 09:53.882
It's a snake in a coven, Andy.
I mean, come on!

09:53.983 --> 09:55.784
It's like bringing...

09:55.885 --> 09:59.788
regular tea to an iced-tea...
convention.

10:00.758 --> 10:02.791
At a certain point,
that tea is getting iced.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.727
Okay. It's not a perfect... metaphor.

10:05.829 --> 10:07.729
But I'm sorry. I'm feeling flustered

10:07.831 --> 10:09.665
and a bit off my game.
I am like a guy who's...

10:11.048 --> 10:12.801
normally on his game but...

10:12.902 --> 10:15.204
F... me! Goddammit! This is hard!

10:15.305 --> 10:16.939
Mark, Mark, Mark! It's okay!

10:17.040 --> 10:19.274
Look, it's just a little rejection.

10:19.375 --> 10:21.143
And, um... How do I put this?

10:21.244 --> 10:23.212
What do you do when
you get knocked down?

10:24.808 --> 10:25.914
You get back up again.

10:27.517 --> 10:28.872
You mother...

10:28.873 --> 10:29.973
- Dany Boy!
- Oh, motherf...!

10:30.053 --> 10:32.955
But you are my favourite child.

10:33.056 --> 10:34.957
- Hey, man!
- Hey!

10:35.058 --> 10:37.359
I'd like to return
these robes if I could.

10:37.460 --> 10:40.195
Oh, the black underwear is final sale.

10:40.296 --> 10:42.231
I can only take the robes
if they are... unblooded.

10:42.332 --> 10:45.901
- Well, no worries there, man.
- Or any other fluids?

10:47.208 --> 10:49.404
You don't have to worry about anything.
I promise you.

10:49.506 --> 10:52.174
Okay, just... I've had people
trying to return these robes

10:52.275 --> 10:54.510
- in the past, and... wasn't cool!
- Right.

10:54.611 --> 10:58.847
Let's just say after <i>Eyes Wide Shut,</i>
everything changed.

10:58.948 --> 11:01.316
Uh-huh. Yeah. Well,
these are clean robes. I promise you.

11:01.417 --> 11:03.285
So... no need to worry.

11:03.386 --> 11:06.722
Just to be a 100% clear,
I'm talking about semen.

11:06.823 --> 11:08.857
I know exactly what
you are talking about.

11:08.958 --> 11:10.213
- Okay. Just have to check.
- Yeah.

11:10.214 --> 11:11.514
You look different today.

11:11.995 --> 11:14.863
Tasted darkness? Perhaps rejection?

11:14.964 --> 11:17.099
Hmm-hm. Yeah.
Yeah, you could say that again.

11:17.200 --> 11:20.135
Perhaps you are ready to see
what's behind the blue curtain.

11:21.451 --> 11:22.337
But know this:

11:23.921 --> 11:25.874
For all that cross this threshold,

11:25.975 --> 11:28.343
they must be prepared
to walk the left-hand path.

11:32.782 --> 11:36.018
Welcome to my unholy sanctum.

11:36.119 --> 11:41.123
As you can see, we have a wide selection
of spells, tomes, and...

11:41.834 --> 11:43.449
some light pornography.

11:43.484 --> 11:45.027
Oh, that's cool, man. Thanks.

11:45.128 --> 11:48.077
<i>Naked for Satan. The Blackened Tryst...</i>

11:48.572 --> 11:50.140
- <i>Ass 5...</i>
- Yeah, no.

11:50.175 --> 11:51.567
I'm not super into that,

11:51.668 --> 11:53.569
- but thank you so much.
- Okay!

11:53.670 --> 11:56.638
But if I may say,
if you were put off by <i>Ass 4,</i>

11:56.739 --> 11:58.607
<i>Ass 5</i> puts the franchise

11:58.708 --> 12:02.611
- right back on track.
- Not super familiar with the franchise.

12:02.712 --> 12:04.980
You were saying something
about a left-hand path?

12:05.081 --> 12:07.816
It is a rejection of a society

12:07.917 --> 12:11.561
whose values reject you
and it can all be found...

12:11.596 --> 12:15.157
- here!
- Oh! Hell yeah!

12:17.160 --> 12:20.929
You know, I think
it's time Cavendish got itself...

12:21.757 --> 12:23.732
a real coven.

12:30.086 --> 12:31.840
Okay, okay, I'll read something!

12:32.976 --> 12:35.944
Oh! It's supposed to be read
with an Irish brogue, so...

12:36.837 --> 12:40.891
Pot of gold. Pot of gold.
Daniel Day Lewis.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.322
Okay, I got it. Okay.

12:45.521 --> 12:48.857
"Slade knelt by the unfrozen pond.

12:49.649 --> 12:53.428
"The water looked good. Pure. Wet.

12:54.373 --> 12:55.964
"He tasted it.

12:56.065 --> 12:58.900
"Felt its cool wetness slide into him.

12:59.002 --> 13:01.970
"Surely many have drunk this
frigid draught, he thought.

13:02.071 --> 13:04.206
"This gelid moist.

13:04.307 --> 13:06.875
"Water. Water.

13:08.063 --> 13:10.646
"Father.

13:10.747 --> 13:13.448
My God."

13:15.030 --> 13:17.719
Oh, my goodness. That was wonderful.

13:17.820 --> 13:20.222
And that word you used...

13:20.323 --> 13:22.591
"Gelid"? What does that mean?

13:23.952 --> 13:24.693
Uh...

13:24.794 --> 13:27.796
It's... it's kind of a
word that's hard to define,

13:27.897 --> 13:31.433
but I-I definitely know how
to use it in a sentence.

13:31.534 --> 13:33.368
Just to put this out there.

13:33.469 --> 13:36.371
Maybe you could write us
an opening invocation

13:36.472 --> 13:38.240
for the Solstice Weaving this weekend,

13:38.341 --> 13:40.042
something that you
could read to the town?

13:42.011 --> 13:43.011
I would love to!

13:44.914 --> 13:48.350
Thank you! That's fantastic!

13:48.451 --> 13:51.687
Oh! I kind of feel like a cool
wetness is sliding into me!

13:54.490 --> 13:57.559
"Baphomet, Amon, Moloch and Baal,

13:57.660 --> 14:00.495
"Lords of Darkness look upon
us this night with hungry eyes

14:00.596 --> 14:03.632
"and angry bones.

14:03.733 --> 14:07.569
We besiege thee."
And thee, and thee, and thee.

14:07.670 --> 14:09.471
Thank you for being here, everyone.

14:09.572 --> 14:11.406
Thank you so much. Bryn, thank you

14:11.507 --> 14:13.408
- for crossing over.
- I was promised a bigger horn.

14:13.509 --> 14:17.112
And you shall receive your bigger horn.
Now. Uh, yeah.

14:17.213 --> 14:19.047
Felix? You got... you got a question?

14:21.050 --> 14:22.851
...rid of the tummy grumblies...

14:23.687 --> 14:25.387
Tummy "grumblies". Do you need to...

14:25.488 --> 14:27.255
you need go to the bathroom?
Is that what you're...

14:27.357 --> 14:30.425
Oh yeah! I gotta pinch off
Mike Duffy before too long.

14:30.526 --> 14:33.095
Okay. Well, that is very colorful imagery,
and you are

14:33.196 --> 14:35.864
welcome to use the bathroom.
You do not need to ask.

14:37.846 --> 14:38.934
...half hour, so continue on

14:39.035 --> 14:40.655
with your Halloween chitchat or whatnot.

14:40.671 --> 14:44.616
Alright. Let's break this down, ladies
and gentlemen. There is a 200 year-old

14:44.651 --> 14:46.875
book club in this town
that calls themselves

14:46.976 --> 14:49.945
a coven. This weekend,
they will be celebrating

14:50.046 --> 14:51.747
the Solstice,
presumably by holding hands

14:51.848 --> 14:55.217
and singing <i>Kumbaya</i>. Well, I say

14:55.318 --> 14:58.887
that we show them what a
real coven looks like. So...

14:58.988 --> 15:03.414
any ideas for what we should do?
No wrong answers. Yeah, Travis?

15:03.449 --> 15:05.227
We could do a panty raid.

15:08.035 --> 15:10.671
So... just so I'm a 100% clear,

15:10.706 --> 15:12.901
that's where we would break
into their houses and...

15:13.002 --> 15:15.337
- Steal their panties.
- Steal their panties. Right.

15:15.438 --> 15:18.544
So, okay! I just wanna thank Travis,
right off the bat,

15:18.579 --> 15:20.347
for being the first person
to give a suggestion.

15:20.382 --> 15:21.643
That's never easy. There.

15:21.744 --> 15:23.712
I'm not gonna write that one down,
cause I feel like

15:23.813 --> 15:25.714
it's just a little bit off...
off-base for what

15:25.815 --> 15:27.849
we're looking for here. But yeah...

15:27.950 --> 15:29.651
Let's try to keep this in
the realm of dark magic.

15:29.752 --> 15:32.154
You did say there were no wrong answers.

15:32.255 --> 15:35.190
Yep! I did say that, but,
um, how about starting now,

15:35.291 --> 15:37.359
now that we all know
the parameters. Okay? Yes.

15:37.460 --> 15:39.161
- I like the panty raid idea.
- The panty raid idea

15:39.262 --> 15:42.798
is not on the table, Bryn.
It's not on the table at all.

15:42.899 --> 15:46.034
Here is all you need to know.
Dark magic. Spells. How about that?

15:46.135 --> 15:48.937
We could use spells to make
their panties come to us.

15:49.038 --> 15:53.141
- Okay. Hmm...
- Just like <i>The Sorcerer's Apprentice.</i>

15:53.242 --> 15:55.477
Uh-huh! Yeah, stop. Stop doing that.

15:55.578 --> 15:58.246
I'm... I'm so serious.
I'm so angry and I'm so serious.

15:58.347 --> 16:00.248
- Felix, what do you need, man?
- Um...

16:00.349 --> 16:01.271
What do you need?

16:03.453 --> 16:05.353
...working on...
take care of the tummy grumblies?

16:05.455 --> 16:08.356
Go to the bathroom. I have given you

16:08.458 --> 16:11.293
multiple green lights on that front.
You know what guys?

16:11.394 --> 16:13.361
Look around.
We are sitting in an atmosphere

16:13.463 --> 16:17.499
of absolute darkness here.
Get inspired. Get inspired.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.971
Payne, you must have
some cool ideas. Come on!

16:20.536 --> 16:21.403
Come on!

16:22.107 --> 16:23.839
- I do have a cauldron.
- Now we're talking.

16:23.940 --> 16:25.841
It'd be the perfect place
to store all the panties.

16:25.942 --> 16:28.743
- Oh, my God!
- We can get all the panties...

16:30.484 --> 16:31.346
Stop it!

16:31.971 --> 16:34.156
Stop it! Okay, guys. You know what?

16:34.191 --> 16:37.270
Everything you're pitching
here is child's play.

16:37.305 --> 16:39.542
I'm talking about something big!

16:39.577 --> 16:44.659
I'm talking about tearing
at the very fabric of what they hold...

16:44.760 --> 16:47.863
of what they hold dear.

16:47.964 --> 16:50.332
And I think I know which fabric to tear.

16:50.433 --> 16:53.668
Are you sure you're not saying
exactly what we're saying?

16:53.769 --> 16:55.871
No, Bryn. I am not talking about...

16:56.931 --> 16:57.672
I'm not talking about panties.

17:01.168 --> 17:06.583
Friends, hello and welcome to the 200th
Official Summer Solstice Gathering!

17:09.554 --> 17:12.606
Today we are gathered to
bear witness to everyone's

17:12.624 --> 17:15.858
favourite coven of "heretics"
as they weave a new chapter

17:15.960 --> 17:17.994
into their pagan story!

17:18.096 --> 17:20.664
Please welcome Andy Tennesen.

17:25.203 --> 17:28.672
Thank you, Madam Mayor. This is a little

17:28.773 --> 17:32.409
poem of dedication titled

17:32.510 --> 17:36.547
<i>Summer Into Me.</i>

17:37.324 --> 17:39.082
"Beloved sun,

17:39.183 --> 17:41.503
your rays, like..."

17:51.663 --> 17:55.966
- Mark?
- Good afternoon, everyone.

17:56.067 --> 17:59.603
- What?
- I said good afternoon, everyone.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.972
We can't hear you, man.
Music's too loud. What do you say?

18:02.073 --> 18:03.907
- Music too loud?
- Yeah!

18:04.008 --> 18:07.377
Alright. One second. Okay.
I'll just turn it off. How is that?

18:07.478 --> 18:09.613
- Oh, that's so much better!
- Is that better?

18:09.714 --> 18:11.515
- Yeah.
- Okay. Felix, do you wanna take that?

18:11.616 --> 18:12.680
Take that for me, please.

18:14.586 --> 18:16.386
Don't sell it! Alright? Alright.

18:17.339 --> 18:19.823
So... this is what passes

18:19.924 --> 18:23.460
for witchcraft in this town, is it?
Barbecues,

18:23.561 --> 18:26.396
touch football,
and races in a potato sack...

18:26.497 --> 18:28.865
Mark, why don't you...
Why don't you just calm down

18:28.967 --> 18:31.001
and come hang out with us?

18:31.102 --> 18:33.170
You'd like that, wouldn't you, Andrew?

18:33.271 --> 18:36.473
You'd love it if we'd just hung out

18:36.574 --> 18:39.409
like chums. You may
notice that we are guided

18:39.510 --> 18:41.411
towards a greater purpose now.

18:41.512 --> 18:46.550
So why don't you take your invitation
and shove it up your ass?

18:46.904 --> 18:48.485
I'm here for one thing only.

18:48.586 --> 18:52.982
To watch the world burn,
either literally

18:53.017 --> 18:55.359
or figuratively.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.861
Bryn, give it a skronk!

18:58.879 --> 19:00.530
Hell yeah, bitch! Let's roll!

19:17.548 --> 19:19.349
- The quilt. Ah!
- Mark!

19:19.450 --> 19:22.319
No, Mark, stop! Stop!
Stop! This isn't you.

19:22.420 --> 19:24.221
You don't know anything about me, Andy.
I only care about

19:24.322 --> 19:27.524
- one thing now: Destruction!
- Oh! My God!

19:27.625 --> 19:29.726
Now watch as I tear the very
fabric of your reality apart!

19:29.827 --> 19:32.029
It's not taut enough.
Gotta get it tau...

19:32.130 --> 19:34.231
- NO!
- Ow! Ow, Andy! Ow! Andy!

19:34.332 --> 19:36.366
Andy, you're hurting me.
Ow, ow, ow! Okay! Okay! Okay!

19:36.467 --> 19:39.236
All of this because you got
rejected once in your life?

19:39.337 --> 19:41.805
- Give me the quilt, Andrew!
- No! This is not your quilt!

19:41.906 --> 19:44.041
This is the witches' quilt!
That's our quilt! Come on!

19:44.142 --> 19:47.244
I'm the only one at this
Solstice who's a witch!

19:51.816 --> 19:55.752
Such violence on the Solstice...

19:55.853 --> 19:58.055
This is not what being a witch is about.

19:58.156 --> 20:02.225
This is exactly what being a
witch is about. Right, Payne?

20:02.326 --> 20:05.762
I don't know, man. This feels less
like witchcraft and more like bullying.

20:05.863 --> 20:08.732
Yeah, we really
should've done the panty raid.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.234
The panty raid was never
on the table, Travis!

20:11.335 --> 20:13.670
Never! That was never on the table!

20:16.074 --> 20:18.275
<i>Thank you for saving my daughter</i>

20:18.376 --> 20:20.410
<i>from those human traffickers,
Travel Dog.</i>

20:20.511 --> 20:23.780
<i>And good luck to ye,
wherever you're bound!</i>

20:23.881 --> 20:26.583
I don't know how you do it, Andy.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.286
You get rejected every day.
It's honestly amazing

20:29.387 --> 20:31.254
you haven't taken your own life by now.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.857
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

20:34.756 --> 20:38.128
Hey, sorry I got you
kicked out of your coven.

20:39.057 --> 20:42.265
It's okay. Sorry I hurt your wrist.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.134
Oh, it's okay.

20:44.235 --> 20:45.936
It's alright.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.938
You wanna watch another episode?

20:48.981 --> 20:49.940
Yeah.

20:52.243 --> 20:55.946
<i>I'll find you, Travel Dog.
And when I do,</i>

20:56.047 --> 20:58.648
<i>I'll neuter you in a safe
and professional manner.</i>

20:58.750 --> 21:03.019
<i>Because I am... The Veterinarian!</i>

21:03.121 --> 21:04.498
This show is weird as hell, man!

21:04.589 --> 21:06.890
- Yeah! It's really good!
- Yeah.
