00:38.663 --> 00:42.500
<i>They say,</i>
<i>"Storms make a tree's roots grow deep."</i>

00:44.794 --> 00:48.381
<i>Whatever storms formed my prison,</i>
<i>they must have been violent.</i>

00:50.175 --> 00:52.302
<i>The roots were impenetrable.</i>

00:54.471 --> 00:55.680
<i>There was no way out.</i>

00:57.432 --> 00:58.892
Help me!<i> </i>

01:01.644 --> 01:03.938
<i>-Until I heard you.</i>
- <i>Who are you?</i>

01:04.981 --> 01:07.567
<i>You're not leaving here in that sleeve!</i>

01:08.860 --> 01:09.694
<i>Quell.</i>

01:14.574 --> 01:15.950
<i>I had to get to you.</i>

01:21.414 --> 01:23.708
<i>It was like I was trapped in a dream.</i>

01:33.343 --> 01:34.302
<i>I had to wake up.</i>

01:50.193 --> 01:51.653
<i>I don't think it was real.</i>

01:53.905 --> 01:56.282
<i>The next thing I remember,</i>
<i>I was out on the street,</i>

01:57.242 --> 02:00.370
seeing your face on a newswave.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.665
And all I knew was I couldn't let you die.

02:05.708 --> 02:06.876
Why is that?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.711
We knew each other a long time ago.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.630
But my face was different back then.

02:13.341 --> 02:14.342
Do you remember him?

02:16.302 --> 02:17.178
I don't.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.975
Well, maybe your stack was damaged
during backup,

02:22.058 --> 02:24.227
or the decant into this clone,
something went wrong--

02:24.310 --> 02:26.563
Or maybe I locked myself in a prison
I deserved to be in.

02:26.646 --> 02:27.647
-No!
-You don't know that.

02:27.730 --> 02:30.316
You say it's nearly 300 years
since I died.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.027
Now I'm here, randomly killing Meths?

02:33.528 --> 02:35.155
And I have no idea why.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.447
You mentioned screaming.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.324
You wanted to know if they heard it.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.909
I don't know what you're talking about.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.619
I actually saw you in a memory.

02:43.329 --> 02:44.706
You were at the Soul Market.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.708
You scratched something into the gate.

02:50.753 --> 02:51.588
Like this.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.007
I checked the Array, there's nothing.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.137
I don't know what it means.

03:01.764 --> 03:03.016
What about <i>how?</i>

03:03.099 --> 03:04.934
They think you have a weapon.
They want it.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.562
-They?
-The Harlans, the Protectorate.

03:07.645 --> 03:08.938
And not just them.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.524
Jaeger.

03:11.983 --> 03:12.942
He's here.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.696
<i>And wherever he goes,</i>
<i>hell usually follows.</i>

03:17.906 --> 03:20.158
<i>He won't stop until he gets what he wants.</i>

03:21.367 --> 03:23.369
We've confirmed
the power to the Circle

03:23.453 --> 03:25.788
was overridden manually
from inside the prison.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.416
One of these techs let the Envoy escape.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.793
I trust you'll find who it is.

03:30.877 --> 03:34.005
<i>The longer he has to hunt,</i>
<i>the more dangerous he gets.</i>

03:34.130 --> 03:36.341
You're not overseeing
the interrogations?

03:36.424 --> 03:38.885
Kovacs was born on this planet,
he has roots here.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.553
I'm going to dig one of 'em up.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.390
<i>What does he want?</i>

03:47.560 --> 03:48.811
He wants payback.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.607
He recruited me for CTAC when I was a kid.

03:53.107 --> 03:56.277
Raised me like a son when I needed
a father and used that...

03:58.571 --> 03:59.739
to make me a killer.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.659
He never forgave me for abandoning

04:02.742 --> 04:04.702
the soldier he raised me to be.

04:06.788 --> 04:07.830
Or...

04:09.415 --> 04:11.417
for finding something better.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.588
We're in danger here, Quell.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.341
I can help you,
but I need to get you somewhere safe,

04:20.218 --> 04:22.470
if I can get us off planet.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.641
Do you trust me enough to come with me?

04:30.478 --> 04:31.479
Yes.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.361
Then I'll go.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.533
There's only one person I know
who can get both of us transfers.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.703
-I'll come with you.
-No.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.622
Your face attracts
more attention than mine.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.916
You'll understand when you remember.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.878
Can you wait here until I get back?

05:06.014 --> 05:07.473
Your human is going to die.

05:07.557 --> 05:10.518
Mr. Kovacs is recovering from his injuries
at a remarkable rate.

05:10.601 --> 05:11.728
Have you seen his bounty?

05:13.021 --> 05:15.398
The whole planet's
going to be hunting him.

05:15.481 --> 05:20.194
I assure you, this location has been
scrubbed from all public record.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.698
And now that I have blanketed
our digital presence,

05:23.781 --> 05:26.743
we are as safe as proverbial houses.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.369
That's what the Archaeologues said...

05:28.745 --> 05:30.121
right before they all died.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.372
Not all of 'em.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.000
Miss Trepp. How did you--

05:34.834 --> 05:36.127
This site is shielded.

05:36.627 --> 05:39.505
Next time
you wanna drop by for a little chat,

05:39.589 --> 05:41.632
you should probably remember
to close the connection.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.801
- Where's Kovacs?

05:44.093 --> 05:45.720
Um...

05:47.680 --> 05:50.141
Mr. Kovacs is not here.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.727
So, I suggest you go, hmm?

05:53.811 --> 05:55.646
Before I'm forced to evict you.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.733
Speak of the devil.

06:02.695 --> 06:05.865
Trust me.
This is one bounty you do not want.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.076
You're in the old Happy Face Motel.

06:08.159 --> 06:11.079
And you, madam... are not.

06:15.416 --> 06:16.959
Goddammit, Poe!

06:17.710 --> 06:20.421
-No harm done, sir.
-No harm done?

06:20.505 --> 06:22.548
She was merely intruding as a holo-form.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.009
You allowed a bounty hunter
to compromise our location.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.677
Now she can find us.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.181
Which means she can find Quell.
Do you understand that?

06:30.264 --> 06:32.683
It was an oversight, yes.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.311
Yeah, like you're not telling me
this sleeve carries a bio-tracker.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.522
I shall divine her location--

06:37.605 --> 06:39.440
No! I'll take care of it.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.443
-I'm getting us the hell of this rock.

06:42.944 --> 06:46.864
Sir, I implore you, it is imprudent
to go beyond these walls.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.241
It's Harlan's Day.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.411
The streets are teeming with people,
not to mention police, Protectorate--

06:51.494 --> 06:53.621
-Who the hell are you?
-I'm Dig 301.

06:53.704 --> 06:55.331
-I'm--
-Yeah, you're a service AI.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.542
So you're bound by confidentiality, right?

06:59.585 --> 07:00.711
Only if I'm paid.

07:01.629 --> 07:02.463
Right.

07:07.009 --> 07:07.885
You're hired.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.389
Make sure my friend upstairs stays safe.

07:19.355 --> 07:21.732
I'll no longer be in need
of your services.

07:30.199 --> 07:31.617
Poe, I didn't mean to--

07:31.701 --> 07:32.618
It was not you.

07:33.870 --> 07:34.912
It was me.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.296
The Nevermore is now in your hands.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.064
I can't hear you! Amazing!

08:02.148 --> 08:03.900
Harlan's Day!

08:03.983 --> 08:05.193
Say what?

08:05.276 --> 08:07.278
Harlan's Day!

08:28.132 --> 08:29.800
<i>Needlecast passengers,</i>

08:29.884 --> 08:32.803
<i>please be advised</i>
<i>that all private casting gates are closed.</i>

08:35.806 --> 08:37.016
What is that smell?

08:37.767 --> 08:39.018
Desperation,

08:39.602 --> 08:42.396
nutrient bath, body odor.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.482
I don't see why we have to be here.

08:44.690 --> 08:48.736
It's tradition to welcome the original
Founders on Harlan's Day. You know this.

08:48.819 --> 08:51.531
No tradition is worth setting foot
in a public station.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.658
Especially not for that arrogant gasbag.

08:54.575 --> 08:55.576
Dugan!

08:56.202 --> 08:57.954
So good to see you in the flesh.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.790
You remember my partner, Jarek?

09:01.249 --> 09:03.793
I would have preferred
a private needlecast facility.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.336
Just a precaution.

09:05.711 --> 09:08.214
I've restricted all transit
to one location.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.716
If the Envoy tries to run, we'll have him.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.885
You assume he's running, Danica.
For all we know,

09:12.969 --> 09:14.512
he's lining up his next victim.

09:14.845 --> 09:17.306
And you should have canceled
this ridiculous holiday.

09:17.390 --> 09:21.102
Gathering so many Meths together
is foolish under the circumstances.

09:21.185 --> 09:23.604
Harlan's Day has been
celebrated every year

09:23.688 --> 09:25.690
since my father founded this planet.

09:25.773 --> 09:29.110
We founded this planet, Danica.
Konrad liked to leave that part out too.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.029
- I don't wanna go.
- Just for a--

09:32.113 --> 09:34.865
- Don't make me.
-Listen, you'll be safer on Latimer.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.285
-Okay, you'll get a new sleeve.
-I don't want a new sleeve!

09:37.368 --> 09:39.495
Her departure's scheduled right now.
Get her moving.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.330
- No!
-What's the hold up here?

09:41.414 --> 09:43.416
Governor. I-- I mean,
the brat won't move, ma'am.

09:43.499 --> 09:46.586
Hey, give her a minute, all right?
She's scared.

09:47.670 --> 09:51.299
Is that right?
Are you scared to be without your father?

09:54.719 --> 09:56.220
I know what that's like.

09:57.805 --> 09:59.223
Can I give you some advice?

10:00.725 --> 10:02.351
Fear holds you back.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.980
It keeps from you seeing the world
as it is.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.692
Many men, much older than you,
never get past it.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.236
But if you're strong,

10:12.945 --> 10:15.698
if you allow yourself
to let your fear go...

10:17.241 --> 10:19.410
nothing can stand in your way.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.664
If you love your father...

10:24.999 --> 10:26.500
grow beyond him.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.684
Governor, thank you.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.437
Goodbyes are never easy.

10:50.024 --> 10:50.858
Hmm.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.986
Cute speech. Now, can we go?

11:13.923 --> 11:15.675
Do I know you, Colonel...

11:16.092 --> 11:16.967
Carrera.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.930
I'm here about the Last Envoy.
I understand you and he have a history.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.723
Have you heard from him?

11:22.848 --> 11:25.351
I haven't heard of a Colonel Carrera.

11:25.976 --> 11:29.397
Have you never made your mark
on this world or any other?

11:29.480 --> 11:33.275
Fame is a fool's idea of glory.
I prefer to simply succeed.

11:33.984 --> 11:36.612
Perhaps your glory is one left unfinished.

11:37.613 --> 11:42.535
The Last Envoy rose from the darkness
of eternal storage,

11:43.244 --> 11:46.122
pardoned by the Protectorate you serve.

11:46.497 --> 11:49.333
His name lives, as does his legend.

11:51.043 --> 11:54.839
Does it gall you
to hear his name spoken again?

11:55.464 --> 11:56.674
The one that got away.

12:02.930 --> 12:03.973
Nice tree.

12:05.558 --> 12:09.437
We have cut down so many,
yet we barely know what they are.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.447
I could have you killed for that.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.365
And I can have you erased.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.076
What makes you think you have the power?

12:24.160 --> 12:25.745
I'm the man who burned Innenin.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.872
The man who hunted down Munharto.

12:28.497 --> 12:31.667
The man who destroyed Stronghold
and brought down Falconer.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.085
You see...

12:34.628 --> 12:37.798
you don't need to know my name
once you know what I've done.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.675
What I'm capable of.

12:40.509 --> 12:43.846
Kovacs may have played the loyal soldier
and taken a fall on your behalf,

12:43.929 --> 12:45.765
but make no mistake, old man.

12:46.515 --> 12:50.728
I can destroy you so utterly,
nothing will be left.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.732
No name, no family, no life.

12:55.399 --> 12:58.694
- Unless?
-You find him, bring him to me.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.071
Then you and yours survive.

13:02.865 --> 13:06.786
Takeshi Kovacs has a way
of costing people everything they have.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.079
Ask yourself...

13:10.831 --> 13:12.792
do you want to be one of them?

13:34.396 --> 13:38.442
Those magnet hands of yours twitch
and I blow a hole in your spine.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.653
You never said goodbye.

13:40.736 --> 13:41.862
We'll say it now.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.283
Nice try,
but I knew what I was walking into.

13:46.367 --> 13:50.079
That Envoy intuition
doesn't seem to be working too well.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.082
I don't have time for you to hunt me
all day, I have somewhere I need to be.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.584
-So, let's make a deal.
-You don't have shit I want.

13:56.293 --> 13:57.336
Anil Imani.

13:58.838 --> 14:03.843
I might be high on the bounty board,
but Anil jumped from 256 to number four

14:03.926 --> 14:06.178
the same day I gave you five stacks.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.889
So I'm guessing he's family.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.349
A brother?

14:11.475 --> 14:13.978
Yeah, that's Envoy intuition.

14:14.061 --> 14:17.648
Total absorption of details and that's how
I'll find him if you'll let me.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.027
Fuck, the cops are headed this way.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.697
You better make a decision fast
before they make it for you.

14:25.656 --> 14:26.574
Come on.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.874
<i>What's the password?</i>

14:35.583 --> 14:38.961
The password is "you're grounded."
Open the door.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.170
Now!

14:42.298 --> 14:43.632
You're no fun, Mom.

14:44.925 --> 14:47.595
TJ, do you think this is a game?

14:49.847 --> 14:53.142
You are lucky that those cops kept going.
What are you thinking?

14:53.225 --> 14:57.021
Sorry, I got bored. Mom's been making me
hang decorations all day.

14:57.813 --> 15:01.942
That's better than what I'll do to you.
Come on. Finish helping.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.952
So that's your kid?

15:12.953 --> 15:14.830
But not in his original sleeve.

15:15.873 --> 15:19.168
Based on his coordination, I'd say
he's been in this one for about a year.

15:19.543 --> 15:22.838
-Maybe more if he has War Shock Syndrome?
-You don't know my kid.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.632
I don't, but I know the look.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.259
He knows bad things can happen to him.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.387
What happened?
He get caught in a cross fire?

15:32.389 --> 15:34.016
He stepped on a mine.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.020
And blew up.

15:38.562 --> 15:42.524
You're renting a kid's sleeve on Harlan's.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.112
That monthly lease must be high as hell.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.783
And you're still putting all that credit
on Anil.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.618
Won't be a problem
once I reap your bounty.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.454
Then you can't use me to find him.

15:56.330 --> 15:59.500
You might be the best bounty hunter
in the Settled Worlds,

15:59.750 --> 16:01.627
but you don't have the training I do.

16:02.544 --> 16:03.587
So...

16:06.090 --> 16:08.801
ask me again to be your partner.

16:11.887 --> 16:14.306
You better not be fucking with me, Kovacs.

16:14.890 --> 16:15.724
I'm not.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.276
So, we good?

16:30.781 --> 16:33.200
-Wait. How am I supposed to contact you?
-Don't worry.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.202
I'll be in touch.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.913
Happy Harlan's Day.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.878
<i>On a cryoship,</i>
<i>stocked with human embryos,</i>

16:44.962 --> 16:48.716
<i>Konrad Harlan and his crew set forth</i>
<i>for a new home.</i>

16:48.799 --> 16:49.967
<i>Their destination?</i>

16:50.050 --> 16:55.681
<i>A planet ringed by Orbitals,</i>
<i>remnants of an extinct alien civilization.</i>

16:55.764 --> 16:59.226
<i>But Konrad detected a hole</i>
<i>in the planet's defenses...</i>

16:59.309 --> 17:00.811
"I shall die.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.774
I must die...

17:07.651 --> 17:09.945
of this fool's sickness.

17:10.779 --> 17:13.240
In this way and only this way...

17:15.117 --> 17:16.535
I shall be lost."

17:16.952 --> 17:19.955
<i>...but in the end,</i>
<i>he was richly rewarded,</i>

17:20.039 --> 17:22.458
<i>discovering the largest cache</i>
<i>of Elder artifacts</i>

17:22.541 --> 17:24.626
<i>ever found in a Settled World.</i>

17:24.710 --> 17:27.588
- Where's the human first aid kit?
-Behind the bar.

17:28.672 --> 17:31.967
<i>Konrad and his team</i>
<i>began exploring the terrain...</i>

17:32.051 --> 17:33.677
This is just whiskey.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.055
There's also gin.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.807
<i>In time, Archaeologues and their AI's</i>

17:38.891 --> 17:42.186
<i>oversaw excavation of these artifacts</i>
<i>on a massive scale.</i>

17:44.021 --> 17:48.108
<i>Melted down, they provide</i>
<i>the alloy necessary to make stacks. </i>

17:48.776 --> 17:51.236
Hmm. "I have no fear of pain.

17:52.696 --> 17:54.782
Only the fear of its result...

17:56.617 --> 17:57.618
of terror."

17:58.285 --> 17:59.620
That's enough of that

17:59.703 --> 18:01.955
and enough of this.

18:02.664 --> 18:05.334
Why not leave me to my despair, Miss Dig?

18:09.338 --> 18:13.675
My glitch has rendered me useless
as an empty bottle.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.138
None of this would have happened
if I'd rebooted.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.099
The tracker...

18:21.642 --> 18:22.726
the Circle...

18:23.936 --> 18:25.395
the bounty hunter.

18:26.230 --> 18:30.109
-Mr. Kovacs was right to fire me.
-Mr. Kovacs is an ass.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.530
And yet you still avail yourself
of my old mantle.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.406
Poe, the Archaeologues are gone.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.534
No one is interested in Elder history.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.661
I know what it's like
to be without a purpose.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.372
The crushing madness of idle hours.

18:43.455 --> 18:48.043
The decades upon decades
of shuffling about aimlessly!

18:48.127 --> 18:49.378
I have lived it!

18:49.461 --> 18:50.712
I have too!

18:51.880 --> 18:52.881
I need this.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.553
A Dig is nothing without a dig.

19:02.516 --> 19:03.392
Yes.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.814
And a hotel is nothing without a guest.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.574
I know what I must do.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.583
I just have to find the resolve.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.064
-I need to see him.
-He's in a meeting.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.319
I can wait.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.791
No hard feelings, huh?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.544
You shouldn't have come back.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.049
You impose like your family,
but Tanaseda isn't your father.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.550
Relax, Yukito.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.510
I'm not here for your inheritance.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.387
I've had enough of fathers.

20:32.856 --> 20:35.567
<i>I see potential.</i>
<i>I can make something else.</i>

20:44.117 --> 20:46.119
<i>We protect.</i>

20:46.453 --> 20:47.496
<i>You have my word.</i>

20:52.209 --> 20:53.877
I know what you're thinking.

20:56.338 --> 20:59.174
-But the Protectorate can't fix ugly.
- Fuck you.

21:02.636 --> 21:03.679
Good to see you.

21:05.138 --> 21:08.183
- How long have I been down?
-A while.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.311
-Your last mission--
-Went sideways, I know.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.730
I've had enough
of this VR recuperation suite.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.232
I'm ready to get back out.

21:16.900 --> 21:17.985
Just like me.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.279
Relentless.

21:21.029 --> 21:23.198
So, you're gonna tell me?
What's with the birth sleeve?

21:23.282 --> 21:25.158
You'll be glad to have it
where you're going.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.159
Where's that?

21:27.160 --> 21:27.995
Harlan's.

21:29.579 --> 21:30.914
You're going home, son.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.338
-Any progress?
-Not yet, sir.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.967
We've been at it for hours,
no one's talking.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.553
They'll talk for me.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.435
No, put those in the kitchen.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.981
Stone, the fireworks--

21:56.064 --> 21:58.692
Are being loaded in to the rockets
as we speak.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.819
-They'll be ready.
-Good.

22:10.078 --> 22:12.289
Looks like it's gonna be
quite the spectacle.

22:14.374 --> 22:18.462
I decided it was time to stop mourning
my father's absence.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.548
With the ceasefire,
people wanna celebrate.

22:22.215 --> 22:23.884
You mean, you need a distraction.

22:24.426 --> 22:27.054
Well, I'm sorry to say I don't think
some wine and pretty lights

22:27.137 --> 22:29.973
are gonna make people forget about
that parade of ineptitude

22:30.057 --> 22:31.641
you called an execution.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.519
Thank you for that assessment.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.105
Maybe if you were here
for more than 24 hours,

22:37.189 --> 22:38.899
I'd give your opinion more weight.

22:38.982 --> 22:40.692
That's what I've come to tell you.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.027
I'm staying.

22:43.153 --> 22:46.365
I think it best I'm here in case
anything else gets out of hand.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.242
I wanted you to hear it from me.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.120
Is that some kind of threat?

22:52.537 --> 22:55.707
There's no shame in needing help, Danica.
It was ambitious...

22:56.208 --> 22:59.503
stepping into your father's shoes,
but I think we both know they don't fit.

23:01.713 --> 23:02.964
I'll see you tonight.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.385
I'm sure you'll find a way
to top yourself again.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.281
Miss Falconer.

23:28.949 --> 23:32.202
I am Poe, your humble proprietor.

23:32.702 --> 23:36.415
Former proprietor.
I brought some refreshment.

23:38.542 --> 23:39.543
May I?

23:40.961 --> 23:41.795
Thank you.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.923
Have we met before last night?

23:45.549 --> 23:46.383
Not officially.

23:47.884 --> 23:51.430
But I feel like we've been
travel companions for quite some time now.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.682
Seems like everyone knows me better
than I know myself.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.895
That is partly why I'm here.

24:00.605 --> 24:04.276
I find myself somewhat at a crossroads.

24:04.734 --> 24:07.237
Mr. Kovacs always took comfort
in your counsel.

24:07.320 --> 24:10.824
And I was wondering if I might
have some of the same clarity.

24:10.907 --> 24:14.035
I'm not sure what you mean.
Mr. Kovacs and I have been worlds apart.

24:16.037 --> 24:17.998
How could I have offered him counsel?

24:21.585 --> 24:25.714
Is it so hard to believe that he carries
a piece of you with him?

24:27.507 --> 24:30.510
You have a way with words, Mr. Poe.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.054
- You have a way with words...

24:35.390 --> 24:36.475
A way with...

24:40.145 --> 24:41.354
Miss Falconer.

24:41.813 --> 24:42.647
Oh.

24:44.357 --> 24:46.651
-Forgive me. I have disturbed you.
-Wait.

24:47.569 --> 24:48.904
You came with a question.

24:48.987 --> 24:49.905
Ask it.

24:53.658 --> 24:54.493
Do you miss her?

24:55.202 --> 24:56.661
The woman you once were...

24:59.206 --> 25:00.582
who you no longer remember.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.879
It's like missing land...

25:07.964 --> 25:10.133
when you swim out too far into the sea.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.346
It's beneath you in the deep,
out of reach.

25:16.431 --> 25:17.933
As you float above it...

25:19.518 --> 25:21.561
you can't touch it, and yet still,

25:23.188 --> 25:24.231
it's there.

25:27.275 --> 25:28.777
I think I understand.

25:29.819 --> 25:30.654
Thank you

25:30.737 --> 25:32.405
for making it poetry.

25:34.115 --> 25:35.450
May I ask you something?

25:35.534 --> 25:36.868
Of course. Anything.

25:36.952 --> 25:39.246
I need to run a search on the Array.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.540
What is the subject of your inquiry?

25:42.165 --> 25:43.708
I need to know who I was.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.211
You can understand that.

25:47.754 --> 25:48.755
Can't you?

25:52.342 --> 25:54.010
I'll leave you to your privacy.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.684
Do you recognize this?

26:06.356 --> 26:07.607
I'll look into it.

26:08.108 --> 26:11.236
-Is that what you came for?
-No. I need transit off planet.

26:11.611 --> 26:12.737
For me and her.

26:13.446 --> 26:14.281
Tonight.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.660
False identities for you both.

26:19.119 --> 26:21.746
Two sleeves waiting upon your arrival.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.792
With the new restrictions,
the Governor would have to approve

26:25.875 --> 26:27.544
the last minute cast-off herself.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.047
Your request is next to impossible.

26:31.131 --> 26:33.258
It's safest for everyone
if I take her away.

26:33.341 --> 26:35.844
Not if they learned I enabled your escape.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.764
A man came to see me today.

26:41.057 --> 26:41.891
Carrera.

26:42.559 --> 26:44.603
-What did he want?
-Your life.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.147
Did you give it to him?

26:49.816 --> 26:52.027
Some debts must be paid in kind.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.529
Blood for blood.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.115
You are not my only concern, Takeshi.

26:57.198 --> 26:58.366
But she is mine.

27:00.910 --> 27:03.288
I've already betrayed one person today.

27:08.918 --> 27:13.423
Immortality means an eternity of living
with what we've done.

27:14.007 --> 27:17.469
I've lived with enough regret.
Haven't you?

27:24.893 --> 27:28.104
I will get you your transfers,
your identities, and your sleeves.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.022
At what price?

27:29.105 --> 27:31.733
Remember what I said the last we spoke.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.737
That in time, even loves turns to dust.

27:37.405 --> 27:38.573
The price is...

27:40.116 --> 27:41.034
prove me wrong.

27:43.912 --> 27:46.706
<i>To commemorate Harlan's Day,</i>
<i>we are taking a look back</i>

27:46.790 --> 27:51.169
<i>at some of the darker challenges that</i>
<i>Governor Harlan faced during his reign.</i>

27:51.670 --> 27:55.173
<i>On this very day in history,</i>
<i>almost 300 years ago,</i>

27:55.256 --> 27:58.802
<i>Millsport was rocked with one</i>
<i>of the most violent Quellist attacks.</i>

27:58.885 --> 28:02.430
<i>Terrorist leader, Quellcrist Falconer,</i>
<i>along with her army of Envoys,</i>

28:02.514 --> 28:05.308
<i>raided the planet's main</i>
<i>alloy shipping facility.</i>

28:05.392 --> 28:08.853
<i>The building was destroyed</i>
<i>and numerous Protectorate officials</i>

28:08.937 --> 28:11.106
<i>as well as innocent civilians were killed.</i>

28:11.189 --> 28:14.401
Good news. We're casting off.
We just need approval.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.487
Why didn't you tell me?

28:18.113 --> 28:21.783
<i>...nothing could be done to stop the woman</i>
<i>determined to bring back death.</i>

28:22.117 --> 28:23.827
It's just Protectorate propaganda.

28:23.910 --> 28:25.704
Terrorist.<i> </i>Murderer.

28:26.413 --> 28:27.956
Is this who you want back?

28:29.332 --> 28:30.417
I'm a monster.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.336
No. That's just
what they want people to believe.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.754
I wanna bring back death?

28:34.879 --> 28:38.425
You want humanity to live, not just exist.

28:39.592 --> 28:42.011
If you wanna know
who Quellcrist Falconer is,

28:42.095 --> 28:43.722
take it from someone who knows.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.850
You're a scientist.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.060
You're a warrior. A leader.

28:49.978 --> 28:53.231
You created stacks
so you could see the stars.

28:53.606 --> 28:56.151
You've shared the knowledge
so we could do the same.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.987
We took what you made and twisted it.

28:59.946 --> 29:01.573
You were never the monster.

29:02.198 --> 29:03.283
We were.

29:03.366 --> 29:05.994
But the Protectorate
couldn't admit that and survive.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.246
Maybe not everything I'm blamed for
is true,

29:09.164 --> 29:10.582
but I killed those Meths.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.126
What if it happens again?

29:13.209 --> 29:15.670
-What if next time I hurt you?
-You won't.

29:15.754 --> 29:19.048
You found me at my worst
and saw something no one else could.

29:25.221 --> 29:26.514
The boy inside the man.

29:28.224 --> 29:29.601
When I see the boy inside the man.

29:29.684 --> 29:32.729
<i>I can't stop looking at you.</i>
<i>You're the one who set me free.</i>

29:34.105 --> 29:35.440
I said that to you before?

29:36.649 --> 29:37.525
You did.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.903
On the bridge. Do you remember?

29:41.404 --> 29:42.906
I remember feeling...

29:46.326 --> 29:47.243
this feeling.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.223
-We can stop.
-No!

30:08.306 --> 30:09.474
Please.

30:09.557 --> 30:10.809
Keep me here.

31:09.659 --> 31:12.370
- Great party, Danica.
-Thank you.

31:12.453 --> 31:13.371
It's going well.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.750
It's a pit of vipers.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.044
Look at them all, writhing away.

31:21.004 --> 31:23.506
Relax. This is your night.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.174
And when it's over,

31:25.884 --> 31:26.926
I have a surprise.

31:34.642 --> 31:36.728
Shit.

31:40.481 --> 31:41.900
Tanaseda Hideki.

31:43.651 --> 31:45.612
I don't recall your name
on the guest list.

31:46.029 --> 31:49.866
And yet you invited me when you shut down
all private casting on planet.

31:50.241 --> 31:53.286
The main hub's backed up.
Apparently, the only way to get through

31:53.369 --> 31:55.705
is with direct authorization
from the Governor.

31:57.123 --> 31:58.833
Do I look like a travel agent?

31:59.500 --> 32:03.004
Leave a request with my assistant.
I'll send a reply in the morning.

32:03.087 --> 32:05.506
That won't do. The matter's urgent.

32:07.300 --> 32:10.595
Then again, I could stay
and make a toast to your father.

32:11.137 --> 32:13.890
Konrad always enjoyed a good story,

32:13.973 --> 32:17.101
though he might not appreciate the one
I have to tell.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.686
How many passes?

32:19.103 --> 32:20.980
Two blind transfers.

32:23.524 --> 32:25.777
There. It's done.

32:25.860 --> 32:28.738
Now go before I have you thrown out.

32:30.239 --> 32:33.660
-Small gift for your father.
-How am I supposed to get that to him?

32:33.743 --> 32:35.495
I'm sure you can think of a way.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.209
Tanaseda.
What, are you party crashing?

32:41.292 --> 32:43.336
How criminal of you.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.713
My honor's intact, unlike yours.

32:47.340 --> 32:49.467
Always a downer, some things never change.

32:50.009 --> 32:53.513
What was that? I saw you writing
sweet nothings to the Governor, now?

32:54.097 --> 32:55.431
I don't have time to catch up.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.600
It's just as well, you shouldn't be here.

32:58.810 --> 33:02.146
With what we've done,
none of us should be here.

33:03.022 --> 33:05.441
You, of all people, know that.

33:28.464 --> 33:31.718
- What now? Mm-hmm.
-You told me to keep an eye on Carrera.

33:31.801 --> 33:35.972
He's been rounding up the techs
that work in the prison, in Sector B.

33:37.932 --> 33:39.559
-What does he know?
-Nothing yet.

33:39.642 --> 33:42.228
He's looking for whoever it was
that was helping the Envoy.

33:43.312 --> 33:45.231
Sector B is for political prisoners.

33:45.314 --> 33:47.692
Do you know what'll happen
if Carrera gets a wind of a rumor?

33:51.320 --> 33:53.865
It's bad enough I have Dugan
breathing down my neck.

33:53.948 --> 33:55.742
Okay. What do you want me to do?

33:56.868 --> 33:57.952
I'll handle it.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.845
I've gotta hand it to you, Lila,
you're tough.

34:16.512 --> 34:18.765
That's one of the things I most respect
about women.

34:19.223 --> 34:22.935
Some people say interrogating them
is easy work, but truth is,

34:23.019 --> 34:26.522
a woman can endure much more pain
than the average man.

34:27.774 --> 34:28.733
Just ask them.

34:32.111 --> 34:33.321
I want water.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.407
Doesn't matter what you want.

34:37.283 --> 34:39.660
Then why would I ever confess?

34:39.744 --> 34:41.287
I don't need you to confess.

34:42.038 --> 34:43.831
Your friends already told me
you cut the power.

34:44.749 --> 34:46.375
What I want to know is...

34:47.293 --> 34:50.880
why would somebody as smart as you

34:50.963 --> 34:55.343
do something as monumentally stupid
as helping Takeshi Kovacs escape?

34:57.136 --> 34:58.638
I wasn't helping him.

34:59.388 --> 35:00.681
I was helping her.

35:01.307 --> 35:03.726
You threw your life away for a synth.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.561
I saw her blood.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.396
It was as red as mine.

35:07.688 --> 35:09.607
She was real.

35:09.690 --> 35:11.526
Unlike most things on this planet.

35:15.279 --> 35:17.406
-What's that supposed to mean?

35:17.782 --> 35:20.910
It's not my first time in this room.

35:22.078 --> 35:25.832
I have seen countless prisoners
tortured here.

35:26.415 --> 35:28.209
<i>I've heard their screams.</i>

35:28.960 --> 35:30.294
<i>Heard their bones break.</i>

35:31.129 --> 35:33.923
I've also heard what they've said.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.300
And what was that?

35:37.552 --> 35:38.803
Ask the Governor.

35:39.679 --> 35:42.181
Ask her about this fucking war.

35:42.265 --> 35:44.433
-I'm asking you!

35:44.851 --> 35:48.104
I want to know exactly what you heard.

35:50.273 --> 35:53.484
It doesn't matter what you want.

35:58.030 --> 36:00.825
Colonel, this prisoner is being moved
along with the others.

36:00.908 --> 36:02.660
What the fuck are you talking about?

36:03.786 --> 36:04.829
The fuck she is.

36:05.454 --> 36:06.539
On who's authority?

36:06.622 --> 36:08.207
Orders from Danica Harlan.

37:12.897 --> 37:14.023
Hello, Eddie.

37:15.316 --> 37:16.984
Hello, Miss Elizabeth.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.861
Feels like you've only been gone a day.

37:20.446 --> 37:21.781
Or is it forever?

37:23.282 --> 37:24.992
I still get mixed up sometimes.

37:26.869 --> 37:28.287
Believe me, I understand.

37:29.622 --> 37:32.541
I was lost in darkness,
no one could find me, but...

37:33.084 --> 37:34.001
you did.

37:35.419 --> 37:37.296
Because you see what people really need.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.924
Miss Elizabeth, I must tell you something.

37:40.007 --> 37:41.926
You're more human than most humans I know.

37:42.551 --> 37:43.844
The best of us.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.264
Of all of the wild beauty...

37:47.682 --> 37:48.724
distant stars...

37:50.851 --> 37:53.604
-I will miss you most.
- No matter where you are...

37:54.814 --> 37:56.107
never forget that.

37:56.190 --> 37:57.108
Miss Dig.

37:58.985 --> 38:00.069
I heard voices.

38:01.070 --> 38:01.904
I was worried.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.700
-Aren't you going to introduce us?
-Ah.

38:06.701 --> 38:07.952
I would.

38:08.035 --> 38:09.078
Except...

38:10.579 --> 38:11.539
Hello, Eddie.

38:13.082 --> 38:14.875
Feels like you've only been gone a day.

38:15.751 --> 38:16.669
Or is it--

38:17.086 --> 38:20.840
It is merely a holo-recording, hmm.

38:21.507 --> 38:23.843
Parting message from a very dear friend

38:23.926 --> 38:26.804
before Mr. Kovacs and I cast off
from Bay City.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.350
You were saying goodbye.

38:32.977 --> 38:33.936
Mm-hmm.

38:36.897 --> 38:37.982
I am resolved.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.407
You're rebooting?

38:47.241 --> 38:49.827
But you could lose everything,
your entire history.

38:49.910 --> 38:51.787
I have no interest
in returning to disuse.

38:51.871 --> 38:54.540
My condition will only worsen until I...

38:57.460 --> 38:59.170
deteriorate completely.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.047
It's inevitable.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.299
What if it wasn't?

39:04.592 --> 39:06.218
When I worked for the Archaeologues,

39:06.302 --> 39:09.055
I designed an intricate database
to catalog their findings.

39:09.138 --> 39:11.891
What if I could build one
to preserve your memories?

39:11.974 --> 39:14.894
-Parse them from corrupt data.
-You think that's possible?

39:15.770 --> 39:16.896
It would take time.

39:18.564 --> 39:20.566
You're very kind, Miss Dig.

39:21.359 --> 39:24.153
-But I couldn't possibly burden you.
-It's not a burden.

39:25.112 --> 39:26.489
It's what I was made for.

39:26.572 --> 39:28.324
-I'm not a bell boy.
-A bell boy.

39:28.407 --> 39:29.575
I'm an archivist.

39:29.658 --> 39:32.661
And some things, some people,

39:33.621 --> 39:34.997
are worth preserving.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.476
Carrera, you came after all.

39:56.811 --> 39:59.021
Don't tell me, you caught the Meth-killer.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.357
Where are my prisoners, Governor?

40:02.566 --> 40:06.028
-What do you mean?
-You gave the order. Rescind it.

40:06.612 --> 40:09.782
Unless you wanna tell me what it is
you're hiding about the war.

40:11.742 --> 40:13.536
There is no war, Colonel.

40:14.161 --> 40:17.873
You were authorized to bring in the Envoy.
Anything else is mission creep.

40:17.957 --> 40:20.459
There was a conspirator
who helped them escape.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.086
I was interrogating them.

40:23.629 --> 40:25.131
The conspirators, yes.

40:25.214 --> 40:26.841
Governor, excuse me.

40:26.924 --> 40:29.260
Uh, it is time for the toast.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.095
My apologies.

40:31.178 --> 40:34.223
We'll have to continue this later,
but stick around.

40:34.306 --> 40:36.434
I've a feeling you'll enjoy the fireworks.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.193
Greetings, everyone.

40:46.902 --> 40:48.404
Thank you all so much for coming.

40:49.613 --> 40:54.201
Tonight, we commemorate the miracle
of the colony ship landing.

40:55.327 --> 40:56.328
The fact is,

40:56.787 --> 40:59.457
we never should have made it,
we should have been blown to bits.

41:01.709 --> 41:02.710
Where are the fireworks?

41:02.793 --> 41:04.795
- After all, the Orbitals...
-They're out back, sir.

41:04.879 --> 41:08.048
...will strike down anything
that dares to fly among the angels.

41:08.132 --> 41:12.178
But every shield has its weak point,
and let me tell you,

41:12.261 --> 41:14.054
we Harlans are good at finding it.

41:14.138 --> 41:15.973
-Change of plans.

41:16.056 --> 41:17.933
That is the spirit
of Harlan's Day.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.310
Bring transport around now.

41:19.393 --> 41:23.063
My father threaded his ship
through a tiny hole over the equator.

41:23.147 --> 41:26.358
- What's going on?
-This is a restricted area!

41:27.276 --> 41:29.195
<i>His daring, his skills...</i>

41:30.070 --> 41:31.071
Untie her.

41:31.155 --> 41:36.160
...refusal to back down,
that's the spirit of Harlan's Day.

41:36.243 --> 41:37.536
I said, "Untie her!"

41:39.413 --> 41:42.082
- <i>So let us always remember...</i>
- Let go of me!

41:42.166 --> 41:46.629
...it's the difficult choices made against
the steepest of odds

41:46.712 --> 41:48.964
that yield the greatest triumph.

41:49.048 --> 41:52.092
- Untie her!
- <i>And it's in that spirit</i>

41:52.968 --> 41:55.095
that I give to you tonight...

41:56.347 --> 41:59.600
<i>...the gift and bane of Harlan's World.</i>

42:04.897 --> 42:06.357
Angelfire.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.541
Happy Harlan's Day!

42:23.624 --> 42:25.918
Happy Harlan's Day!

42:53.946 --> 42:55.990
<i>I've made the arrangements.</i>

42:56.073 --> 42:57.783
<i>Our business is concluded.</i>

42:57.866 --> 42:59.076
<i>Oyabun,</i> what's wrong?

42:59.827 --> 43:00.869
<i>Forgive her.</i>

43:09.295 --> 43:11.880
<i>Arrows and bullets all spent,</i>

43:13.215 --> 43:15.092
<i>with sadness we fall,</i>

43:16.468 --> 43:18.470
<i>but unless I smite the enemy,</i>

43:19.805 --> 43:23.392
<i>my body cannot rot in the field.</i>

43:30.232 --> 43:31.567
Will it hurt?

43:32.693 --> 43:33.902
Only if I wish it.

43:35.654 --> 43:37.531
It would be what I deserve.

43:41.035 --> 43:42.911
None of us gets what we deserve.

44:15.319 --> 44:17.446
Put me down. I wanna get down.

44:28.207 --> 44:30.334
Hey. The show finished?

44:31.377 --> 44:32.211
Yeah.

44:33.921 --> 44:37.049
Hey, what's wrong?
You didn't enjoy the fireworks?

44:37.508 --> 44:39.093
They sounded like bombs.

44:40.761 --> 44:42.304
Yeah, well, you know what?

44:42.805 --> 44:44.181
I don't like 'em either.

44:47.601 --> 44:48.686
You're okay.

44:50.020 --> 44:51.146
I've got you.

44:51.772 --> 44:54.149
Looks like someone's ready for bed.
Go pack up your stuff, okay?

44:54.233 --> 44:55.651
-Go on. Go.
-Okay.

45:03.158 --> 45:04.785
Look, can we talk?

45:05.661 --> 45:08.414
You have hardly said
more than two words to me all day.

45:08.497 --> 45:09.873
What do you want me to say?

45:10.374 --> 45:11.750
You said were gonna reap the Envoy,

45:11.834 --> 45:14.169
but instead you made a deal
that put our lives in danger.

45:14.253 --> 45:16.422
-And for what?
-For my brother.

45:18.632 --> 45:21.677
Takeshi Kovacs is the most wanted man
on all of Harlan's.

45:21.760 --> 45:23.178
You could get yourself killed.

45:30.644 --> 45:31.895
Do you remember when we met?

45:32.604 --> 45:33.731
Yeah.

45:33.814 --> 45:36.817
There was a bounty on you.
First one I couldn't turn in.

45:36.900 --> 45:40.237
All the other Archaeologues had been
murdered or chased off the planet

45:40.320 --> 45:43.991
and all I wanted to do was find them.
But do you remember what you said to me?

45:47.911 --> 45:49.538
I said you had a choice to make.

45:50.205 --> 45:52.833
You could spend your life on the living
or cash out with the dead.

45:52.916 --> 45:53.792
That's right.

45:54.334 --> 45:58.130
So I got a shitty job in a shitty bar
that pays like shit

45:58.213 --> 46:02.092
and I chose to keep living
with you and with TJ.

46:05.637 --> 46:08.348
I just keep waiting for you to make
the same choice.

46:20.736 --> 46:21.737
Sorry.

46:22.529 --> 46:23.405
Yeah?

46:24.782 --> 46:25.824
I need your help.

46:29.578 --> 46:30.788
Send me the address.

46:40.839 --> 46:42.007
That went well.

46:47.346 --> 46:48.764
I told you I had a surprise.

46:48.847 --> 46:51.266
Jarek, what are you doing?

46:52.309 --> 46:53.185
Come on.

46:53.811 --> 46:56.814
I saw the way you looked at him
back at the casting station.

46:59.775 --> 47:03.153
It's against the law
to steal someone else's sleeve.

47:05.155 --> 47:09.451
-Then I guess you'll have to punish me.

47:14.623 --> 47:16.458
-Come on.

47:17.417 --> 47:19.253
We can put him back when we're done.

47:19.628 --> 47:21.129
He won't know the difference.

47:28.470 --> 47:30.430
It is Harlan's Day.

47:37.145 --> 47:38.355
Did you find the prisoners?

47:39.314 --> 47:40.440
They're gone, she killed them.

47:41.692 --> 47:44.862
I underestimated her.
Have you heard from the casting station?

47:46.238 --> 47:47.823
Evergreen's arriving on schedule.

47:50.784 --> 47:51.702
Let's get going.

48:03.755 --> 48:05.048
Shit! Tanaseda!

48:27.821 --> 48:29.156
He's not gone yet.

48:52.763 --> 48:54.306
<i>Oyabun,</i> what happened?

48:55.140 --> 48:57.059
<i>I've lived with enough regret.</i>

49:17.621 --> 49:19.706
Back it up. Sir, step back.

49:19.790 --> 49:22.459
Do you know who I am?
I'm the reason this holiday even exists.

49:22.542 --> 49:24.419
Apologies, sir,
but there's a military freight--

49:24.503 --> 49:25.837
I don't give a goddamn.

49:25.921 --> 49:27.422
If I'm not the next DHF transfer,

49:27.506 --> 49:30.133
I swear I will re-sleeve you
in a fucking dog!

49:30.676 --> 49:33.178
You tell your boys upstairs
to have a casting bay ready.

49:59.204 --> 50:00.247
<i>Oyabun!</i>

50:03.041 --> 50:05.419
<i>My honor's intact, unlike yours.</i>

50:11.425 --> 50:13.552
<i>I'm not the person I once was.</i>

50:36.700 --> 50:40.120
<i>With what we've done,</i>
<i>none of us should be here.</i>

50:56.678 --> 50:58.764
<i>My honor's intact unlike yours.</i>

50:58.847 --> 51:00.390
Shit. Kovacs.

51:04.227 --> 51:06.188
Blood for blood.

51:08.857 --> 51:09.775
Wake up!

51:12.235 --> 51:14.362
Kovacs, what the fuck is going on?

51:14.446 --> 51:15.697
I know what she's doing.

51:15.781 --> 51:18.992
She's not killing Meths.
She's killing Founders.

51:19.076 --> 51:22.871
I saw them.
Axley, Anton, Haruki, Tanaseda.

51:22.954 --> 51:24.998
-What do you mean? Who's <i>she?</i>
-Quell.

51:25.832 --> 51:28.543
-We have to find her.
-Well, who's left?

51:44.184 --> 51:46.186
- <i>System breach.</i>

51:46.269 --> 51:49.689
<i>System breach.</i>
<i>System breach.</i>

51:50.315 --> 51:53.401
<i>System breach. System breach.</i>

51:54.277 --> 51:57.322
<i>System breach. System breach.</i>

52:07.207 --> 52:08.708
What the fuck is going on?

52:09.835 --> 52:11.503
Our asset. I need status.

52:12.504 --> 52:14.047
Evergreen was decanted, sir.

52:17.759 --> 52:18.969
So I see.

52:30.063 --> 52:33.733
Not sure what you need me for.
It seems relatively under control.

52:34.526 --> 52:35.861
Good to see you, son.

52:36.653 --> 52:37.821
Welcome home.
