08:49.108 --> 08:55.512
THIS WHOLE THING IS A PLOT

08:55.514 --> 08:57.013
WHEN IS SATAN

08:57.015 --> 08:59.116
DID THE DEVIL

08:59.118 --> 08:59.683

09:16.935 --> 09:18.401

YOU'RE GONNA
KICK HIS ASS, JESUS.

09:23.041 --> 09:24.274
( chanting )

09:24.276 --> 09:28.245

09:41.460 --> 09:43.260
HOLY CRAP, DUDE

09:43.262 --> 09:47.230
NOW THAT IS A MAN WHO HAS
EATEN A LOT OF BEEF.

10:09.221 --> 10:10.720
( crowd gasps )

10:10.722 --> 10:14.024
JESUS CHRIST
WEIGHS IN AT...

10:14.026 --> 10:17.961
135 POUNDS, 1 OUNCE.

10:18.931 --> 10:19.462

10:24.703 --> 10:28.805

10:30.709 --> 10:32.976
WELL, I THINK I'LL...

10:32.978 --> 10:35.011
I THINK I
LEFT THE OVEN ON.

10:35.013 --> 10:40.150
YEAH, I THINK I LEFT
YOUR OVEN ON, TOO.

10:40.719 --> 10:44.721
SEE YOU SATURDAY, JESUS,
GOOD LUCK.

10:45.724 --> 10:47.424
PUT MY MONEY
ON THE DEVIL !
CHANGE MY BET !

10:47.426 --> 10:49.559
I WANT TO CHANGE
MY BET TO SATAN.

10:49.561 --> 10:50.327
ME TOO.

10:50.329 --> 10:51.261
I WAS
HERE FIRST.

10:51.263 --> 10:55.699
AS YOUR COUNSELOR,
I WANT YOU TO FEEL LIKE

10:55.701 --> 10:57.834
YOU CAN TELL ME
ANYTHING, OKAY ?

10:57.836 --> 11:00.203
BEING THE NEW KID
CAN BE TOUGH.

11:00.205 --> 11:02.205
BUT I'M YOUR
FRIEND, M'KAY ?

11:02.207 --> 11:03.440
EVERYBODY
HATES ME.

11:03.442 --> 11:05.976
WELL WHY DO YOU
SUPPOSE THAT IS ?

11:05.978 --> 11:08.812
BECAUSE I'M THE
SON OF THE DEVIL ?

11:08.814 --> 11:10.647
UH-HUH, THAT'S
A GOOD START,

11:10.649 --> 11:11.248
WHY ELSE ?

11:11.250 --> 11:13.717
BECAUSE I BURN THEM
AND KILL THEM ?

11:13.719 --> 11:14.985
WELL, MAYBE
THAT'S IT.

11:14.987 --> 11:19.389
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO, DAMIEN
IS TO BE OVERLY NICE.

11:19.391 --> 11:24.861
NO MATTER HOW MEAN THE OTHER
KIDS ARE, JUST DON'T RETALIATE.

11:24.863 --> 11:25.862
BE PASSIVE.

11:25.864 --> 11:28.365
THAT'S WHAT I TAUGHT
THE BRITISH BOY, PIP.

11:28.367 --> 11:31.668
AND JUST LOOK AT HOW MUCH THE
OTHER CHILDREN LIKE HIM NOW.

11:31.670 --> 11:35.038
I BET I CAN
SPIT THE MOST ON HIM.

11:35.374 --> 11:37.774
OH YEAH, I BET I CAN
SPIT IN HIS HAIR.

11:37.776 --> 11:39.876
NICE TRY, A LITTLE HIGHER
AND YOU'VE GOT IT.

11:39.878 --> 11:42.612
RECESS SUCKS WITHOUT ANY
SLIDES OR NOTHING.

11:42.614 --> 11:45.315
OH, HERE COMES THE
UNHOLY BUTTHOLE NOW.

11:45.317 --> 11:48.151
THANKS A LOT FOR BURNING
EVERYTHING DOWN,

11:48.153 --> 11:48.852
YOU LITTLE BITCH.

11:48.854 --> 11:50.987
I APOLOGIZE FOR
RUINING YOUR PLAYGROUND

11:50.989 --> 11:53.623
AND TURNING YOUR FRIEND
INTO A DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.558
I WAS DOING MY
FATHER'S BIDDING.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.861
I DIDN'T
HAVE A CHOICE.

11:58.597 --> 11:59.262
( fart )

11:59.264 --> 12:00.630
OH EXCUSE ME,
NEW KID

12:00.632 --> 12:02.065
I DIDN'T MEAN TO
FART ON YOU

12:02.067 --> 12:03.199
I DIDN'T
HAVE A CHOICE.

12:03.201 --> 12:05.535
YOU STINK,
NEW KID.

12:05.537 --> 12:06.469
YOU SMELL
LIKE A FART.

12:06.471 --> 12:09.172
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA CALL YOU
FARTBOY FROM NOW ON.

12:09.174 --> 12:10.740
BYE-BYE,
FART BOY.

12:10.742 --> 12:12.142
GOOD DAY, HOW
ARE YOU, DAMIEN ?

12:12.144 --> 12:14.678
THOSE GUYS FARTED ON ME
AND THEN CALLED ME --

12:14.680 --> 12:15.145
FART BOY ?

12:15.147 --> 12:18.381
OH GOOD, PERHAPS THEY WON'T
CALL ME THAT ANYMORE.

12:23.922 --> 12:24.955
EXCUSE ME...

12:24.957 --> 12:28.124
I JUST TALKED TO THE BOOKIE
AT THE SPORTS BETTING BAR.

12:28.126 --> 12:28.792
UH-OH.

12:28.794 --> 12:31.194
I HAVE
BEEN FORSAKEN !

12:31.196 --> 12:32.562
IT SEEMS THAT
SEVERAL BETS

12:32.564 --> 12:33.730
WERE CHANGED TO
SATAN THIS MORNING.

12:33.732 --> 12:38.134
IN FACT IT SEEMS THAT ONLY
ONE PERSON IN THIS ENTIRE TOWN

12:38.136 --> 12:39.235
IS STILL
BETTING ON ME.

12:39.237 --> 12:41.838
YOU SHOULD ALL BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.

12:41.840 --> 12:44.674
BETTING AGAINST
YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR.

12:44.676 --> 12:45.909
I AM DISGUSTED !

12:45.911 --> 12:47.978
YOUR BET WAS
CHANGED AS WELL.

12:47.980 --> 12:49.446
YOU FORSAKED ME TOO.

12:49.448 --> 12:50.347
OH... RIGHT.

12:50.349 --> 12:52.916
WELL, HE DOES HAVE A COUPLE
HUNDRED POUNDS ON YOU, JESUS.

12:52.918 --> 12:55.652
I IMPLORE YOU ALL
DON'T BET ON THE DARK ONE.

12:55.654 --> 12:57.654
IT IS A BET THAT
YOU WILL NEVER WIN.

12:57.656 --> 13:00.090
JESUS, I'M SORRY I HAVE
SINNED AGAINST YOU.

13:00.092 --> 13:02.325
I AM GONNA MARCH RIGHT OVER
TO THAT BOOKIE

13:02.327 --> 13:03.893

13:18.710 --> 13:19.342

13:22.948 --> 13:25.148
YOU'RE ALL A
BUNCH OF JUDASES.

13:25.150 --> 13:25.915
HEY JESUS.

13:25.917 --> 13:27.517

BIRTHDAY PARTY.

13:31.223 --> 13:31.755

DOUBTS, ARE YOU ?

13:38.363 --> 13:42.132
NO... BUT COULD YOU
HELP ME TRAIN A LITTLE ?

13:43.502 --> 13:46.169
SATAN, WHAT DO EXPECT THE
OUTCOME OF THE FIGHT TO BE ?

13:46.171 --> 13:49.205
I WILL CRUSH HIM
LIKE A LITTLE BUG.

13:49.207 --> 13:52.275
SATAN, WHAT ABOUT THE
RUMORS OF YOUR INVOLVMENT

13:52.277 --> 13:54.310
IN THE
GULF WAR ?

13:54.312 --> 13:56.479
LET'S FOCUS ON THE
FIGHT, CAN WE PLEASE ?

13:56.481 --> 13:59.282
I'M SO SICK OF PEOPLE TALKING
SMACK ABOUT MY FIGHTERS.

13:59.284 --> 14:00.950
ALL THIS, "HE MEAN",
"HE'S A DIRTY FIGHTER",

14:00.952 --> 14:03.920
"HE'S THE CAUSE OF ALL THE
VIOLENCE AND THE DEATH IN
THE WORLD."

14:03.922 --> 14:04.921
IT'S JUST
GETTING OLD.

14:04.923 --> 14:07.791
LET'S JUST LET EVERYTHING
BE DECIDED IN THE RING.

14:07.793 --> 14:10.493

14:15.934 --> 14:17.534
I CAN'T HIT
JESUS CHRIST.

14:17.536 --> 14:20.103
MY MOTHER WOULD NEVER
SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.

14:20.105 --> 14:21.871
BUT YOU'RE HIS
SPARING PARTNER, CHEF.

14:21.873 --> 14:23.073

15:12.224 --> 15:13.022
IT'S ALWAYS SUCH
A HUGE EVENT.

15:13.024 --> 15:16.693
SOMETIMES I LIKE TO SNEAK UP TO
THE FENCE AND PRETEND I'M THERE.

15:16.695 --> 15:18.761
THE OTHER KIDS
HAVE ALWAYS HATED YOU ?

15:18.763 --> 15:19.295
OH YES.

YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
GET ME THE RED MEGA-MAN !

17:31.730 --> 17:36.032
NOW I CAN'T MAKE
ULTRA MEGA-MEGA-MAN.

17:36.034 --> 17:37.033
YOU DIRTY, CHEAP-ASS,
PIECE OF CRAP.

17:37.035 --> 17:38.534
THEY'RE ALL OUT
OF THEM, DUDE.

17:38.536 --> 17:40.136
I HATE YOU,
I WANT YOU TO DIE !

17:40.138 --> 17:41.204
DIE !

17:41.206 --> 17:43.139
THAT'S IT,
PARTY IS OVER !

17:43.141 --> 17:45.575
EVERYBODY

17:49.681 --> 17:50.947

17:50.949 --> 17:53.783
PARTY IS OVER,
GET OUT GODDAMNIT !

17:53.785 --> 17:54.851
DUDE, YOU NEED TO
MELLOW OUT.

17:54.853 --> 17:57.287
TAKE YOUR STUPID
"ANTS IN THE PANTS" WITH YOU !

17:57.289 --> 18:00.390
WOW, THAT KID HAS
REAL EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS.

18:00.392 --> 18:01.257
HE DOES THIS
ALL THE TIME.

18:01.259 --> 18:04.694
C'MON CHILDREN, WE CAN STILL
CATCH THE END OF THE FIGHT.

18:04.696 --> 18:06.462
OOOHHHHHHHH !

18:06.464 --> 18:07.563
UGHN !

18:07.565 --> 18:10.366
WHAT A
SPLENDID PARTY !

18:14.105 --> 18:22.078
FIGHT, DAMN IT.

18:22.080 --> 18:25.248
DUDE, JESUS IS GETTING
HIS BUTT KICKED.

18:25.517 --> 18:26.983
YOU'VE GOT TO
FIGHT, JESUS.

18:26.985 --> 18:28.418
WHY, WHAT'S
THE POINT ?

18:28.420 --> 18:29.719
NO ONE BELIEVES IN ME.

18:29.721 --> 18:31.287
EVERYONE PUT THEIR
MONEY ON SATAN.

18:31.289 --> 18:33.890
MY FATHER FORSAKED ME,
THE TOWN FORSAKED ME.

18:33.892 --> 18:35.725
I'M COMPLETELY FORSOOK.

18:35.727 --> 18:36.959
SOMEBODY BET
ON YOU, JESUS.

18:36.961 --> 18:39.662
YOU SAID YOURSELF THAT
ONE PERSON HAS MONEY ON YOU.

18:39.664 --> 18:40.630
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

18:40.632 --> 18:42.398
HE'S WAY TOO
STRONG FOR ME.

18:42.400 --> 18:43.132
I GIVE UP.

18:43.134 --> 18:44.634
GODDAMNIT JESUS
SNAP OUT OF IT !

18:44.636 --> 18:46.135
WHAT WOULD
NANCY KERRIGAN DO, HUH ?

18:46.137 --> 18:47.337
NANCY KERRIGAN
WOULDN'T GIVE UP.

18:47.339 --> 18:48.871
WHEN THINGS WERE LOOKING
THEIR DARKEST

18:48.873 --> 18:50.373
NANCY KERRIGAN FOUGHT
TO BE THE BEST.

18:50.375 --> 18:52.975
SHE WOULDN'T STOP
UNTIL SHE WAS NUMBER ONE.

18:52.977 --> 18:53.576
UHH, STAN.

18:53.578 --> 18:56.012
NANCY KERRIGAN WOULDN'T
SETTLE FOR SECOND BEST.

18:56.014 --> 18:56.546
STAN.

18:56.548 --> 18:58.014
SHE WOULD QUIT UNTIL
SHE BROUGHT HOME THE GOLD.

18:58.016 --> 18:58.614
WHAT ?

18:58.616 --> 19:00.650
NANCY KERRIGAN
GOT THE SILVER, DUDE.

19:00.652 --> 19:03.419
SHE CAME IN SECOND.

19:03.421 --> 19:04.320
REALLY ?

19:04.322 --> 19:05.021
YEAH, DUDE.

19:05.023 --> 19:06.322
NEVER MIND, JESUS
NANCY KERRIGAN SUCKS.

19:06.324 --> 19:11.761
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY ONCE SAID,
"DON'T TRY TO BE A GREAT MAN,

19:11.763 --> 19:13.062
JUST BE A MAN."

19:13.064 --> 19:14.897
WHO SAID THAT ?

19:14.899 --> 19:17.166
YOU DID, JESUS.

19:19.637 --> 19:21.404
YOU'RE RIGHT, STAN.

19:21.406 --> 19:23.706
THANK YOU, BOYS.

19:24.409 --> 19:26.909
WOW, DID HE SAY THAT
IN THE BIBLE ?

19:26.911 --> 19:29.011
NO, I SAW IT
ON STAR TREK.

19:30.582 --> 19:33.149
C'MON SISSY,
HIT ME !

19:33.151 --> 19:37.286
OKAY PAL,
YOU ASKED FOR IT.

19:42.794 --> 19:45.261
OH, YOU GOT ME.

19:45.897 --> 19:47.530
ONE, TWO, THREE...

19:47.532 --> 19:50.500
NO WAY,
HE BARELY
TOUCHED HIM.

19:50.502 --> 19:53.636
7, 8, 9, 10,

19:53.638 --> 19:55.171
YOU'RE OUT !

19:56.474 --> 19:57.740
OUR SAVIOR !

19:57.742 --> 19:58.641
THE WINNER
BY A KNOCKOUT

19:58.643 --> 20:03.713
AND STILL, UNDISPUTED RULER
OF YOUR SPIRITUAL KINGDOM.

20:03.715 --> 20:09.852
Jesús "El Saviourrrr" Christ.

20:11.189 --> 20:12.922
HEY, HE ISN'T HURT,
HE TOOK A DIVE.

20:12.924 --> 20:14.957
HE THREW THE FIGHT.

20:14.959 --> 20:15.558
YEAH !

20:15.560 --> 20:17.860
FOOLS, YOU
ARE ALL FOOLS.

20:17.862 --> 20:19.829
OF COURSE,
I TOOK A DIVE.

20:19.831 --> 20:20.696
DON'T YOU SEE ?

20:20.698 --> 20:22.665
WHO DO YOU THINK
WAS THE ONE PERSON

20:22.667 --> 20:25.535
THAT BET ON
JESUS TO WIN ?

20:26.805 --> 20:28.271
ME, YOU IDIOTS.

20:28.273 --> 20:30.940
NOW I WILL TAKE ALL
YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY,

20:30.942 --> 20:34.377
AND RETURN TO HELL A MUCH RICHER
PRINCE OF DARKNESS

20:34.379 --> 20:35.478
AND BUY SOME
REAL ESTATE.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.547
HA, HA ,HA, HA !

20:37.549 --> 20:38.848
I DON'T
BELIEVE THIS !

20:38.850 --> 20:40.716
YEAH, WHAT A
MEAN THING TO DO.

20:40.718 --> 20:42.919
FAREWELL, FOOLS.

20:42.921 --> 20:44.787
THAT GUY
IS A JERK.

20:44.789 --> 20:48.124
JESUS TOLD YOU GUYS
NOT TO BET ON SATAN.

20:48.126 --> 20:49.559
BOY, DID WE
GET SCREWED.

20:49.561 --> 20:54.130
JESUS, WE'RE SORRY,
CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE US ?

20:54.132 --> 20:58.601
AW, HECK,
DO I HAVE A CHOICE ?

20:58.603 --> 20:59.936
( cheering )

20:59.938 --> 21:02.238
WELL JESUS, I DEFINITELY
LEARNED MY LESSON.

21:02.240 --> 21:05.541
NEVER BET ON EVIL
BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO--

21:05.543 --> 21:06.342
NED, LOOK !

21:06.344 --> 21:08.411
THERE'S A RARE
DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS !

21:08.413 --> 21:11.314
IT'S COMING
RIGHT FOR US !

21:12.350 --> 21:15.117
OH, MY GOD
THEY KILLED KENNY.

21:15.119 --> 21:16.252
YOU BASTARD !

21:16.254 --> 21:17.820
WELL, GOOD-BYE GUYS.

21:17.822 --> 21:19.455
IT WAS NICE
GETTING TO KNOW YOU.

21:19.457 --> 21:21.057
YOU'RE
LEAVING
ALREADY ?

21:21.059 --> 21:21.958
I HAVE TO.

21:21.960 --> 21:23.092
MY DAD IS ALWAYS
ON THE MOVE.

21:23.094 --> 21:25.228
WOW, I FEEL KIND OF
BAD FOR THAT KID.

21:25.230 --> 21:29.031
JUST WHEN HE'S BEING ACCEPTED
HE HAS TO LEAVE AND START OVER.

21:29.033 --> 21:29.932
PARENTS CAN
BE SO CRUEL.

21:29.934 --> 21:34.403
DON'T THEY REALIZE WHAT
A CHILD NEEDS MORE THAN
ANYTHING IS SECURITY ?

21:34.706 --> 21:36.472
MORE PIE, HON ?

21:36.474 --> 21:38.841
YE... NE...

21:39.644 --> 21:42.345
NO-MORE-PIE.
