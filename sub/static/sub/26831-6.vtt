MAN: All right, man versus dog.
My advice: open your mind.

00:09.009 --> 00:12.388
Each of you weighs average
of, what-- 180 pounds.

00:12.430 --> 00:15.099
Your average dog:
80 pounds, man.

00:15.141 --> 00:16.851
So if you fought
an 80-pound dude,

00:16.892 --> 00:18.853
you'd spend half of it laughing

00:18.894 --> 00:21.772
and all of it fucking
that little motherfucker up.

00:21.814 --> 00:23.357
So, approach it
like you're fighting

00:23.399 --> 00:26.277
a little, weird 80-pound man
with powerful jaws.

00:26.318 --> 00:28.112
Let's talk technique.

00:28.154 --> 00:30.823
One that works well--
simply allow your dog opponent

00:30.865 --> 00:33.451
to clamp down
on a lesser-used limb,

00:33.492 --> 00:36.454
like, say, your left arm,
which allows you four minutes

00:36.495 --> 00:38.247
to beat the fucking shit
out of 'em

00:38.289 --> 00:40.750
with your advantaged right hand.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.334
K.O.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.670
You guys know what that is?

00:44.712 --> 00:46.547
Knock out!
Brain damage.

00:46.589 --> 00:48.591
That's what "K.O."
fucking means.

00:48.632 --> 00:51.010
You render their
fucking brains damaged

00:51.051 --> 00:53.053
until they lose consciousness.

00:53.095 --> 00:56.265
So, fight the fucking dog
like a fucking dog

00:56.307 --> 00:59.852
and go right at his ass
and let him bite a lesser limb.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.645
Then knock the little
motherfucker out

01:01.687 --> 01:04.815
by punching him
in the fucking little dog head,

01:04.857 --> 01:07.318
where his little
fuckin' dog brain is!

01:07.359 --> 01:08.819
They're trained
to take you down,

01:08.861 --> 01:11.071
so I'm training you
to take them down,

01:11.113 --> 01:12.490

16:29.781 --> 16:32.450
did it become the plan
to pool your money together

16:32.492 --> 16:36.246
and go and buy
the accordion boy?

16:36.287 --> 16:38.957
After laser tag.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.752
I want to recant that.
May I?

16:42.794 --> 16:45.755
It was after
we roved to the park,

16:45.797 --> 16:49.551
and were at a particular café
together, drinking.

16:49.592 --> 16:52.762
After we were
at a particular pub, drinking.

16:52.804 --> 16:55.598
Before laser tag.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.017
And whose idea was it?

16:58.059 --> 16:59.686
Um...

16:59.728 --> 17:01.771
I thi-I think
it was John Lakeman's.

17:01.813 --> 17:04.107
I think it would've
been John's, that day.

17:04.149 --> 17:06.276
I recall, clearly, that day,

17:06.317 --> 17:10.280
he was full of warm feelings
and pilsners.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.034
I bet we could do it.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.996
How much can buying
a kid cost, anyway?

17:18.037 --> 17:19.748
Not, like, a million.

17:19.789 --> 17:23.084
How much can buying
a kid cost, Icabod?

17:23.126 --> 17:25.670
I don't know, I've never
bought a kid before, John.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.881
(laughs)

17:27.922 --> 17:31.760
I think, like,
1,800 bucks, ballpark.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.679
We're, like,
a hundred bucks short.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.056
I got a hundred euro.

17:37.098 --> 17:40.310
Cool.

17:40.351 --> 17:43.271

I'll explain it to him.

19:13.111 --> 19:15.280
Do you speak English?

19:15.321 --> 19:16.990
I speak Romanian.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.575
No way.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.874

pretty much.

Cool. Tell him he's free.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.712

-Thomash.

19:59.991 --> 20:02.577
-Did you tell him he can go?
-Yeah.

20:02.619 --> 20:04.579
Why didn't he go?

20:04.621 --> 20:06.664
I don't know.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.918
Maybe he feels a bond

22:26.095 --> 22:28.014
-What?
-Fuck.

22:28.056 --> 22:31.392
I got to, like,
es-escape from the situation.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.688
Can you do something
to the normal guy?

22:35.730 --> 22:37.023
Like what?

22:37.065 --> 22:39.025
Like, fuck him up or something?

22:39.067 --> 22:42.070
And then we can run away
from the other guys.

22:42.111 --> 22:45.323
'Cause I'm really fast, and you
guys are probably normal fast.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.284
And they're not going to be,
'cause that one's tiny,

22:48.326 --> 22:51.120
and he has to, like,
take twice as many strides

22:51.162 --> 22:52.663
as the rest of us.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.875

one guy's got one leg.

Yeah. All right.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.382
Wha... What?

23:03.424 --> 23:04.675

23:04.717 --> 23:07.220
Go... knock out the normal guy.

23:07.261 --> 23:08.888
Nah.

23:08.930 --> 23:10.515
Wh-Why?

23:10.556 --> 23:12.433
H-He's not normal.

23:12.475 --> 23:14.769
He just looks normal.

23:35.832 --> 23:37.416

23:37.458 --> 23:39.502
-What?
-These guys were saying

23:39.544 --> 23:42.839
some fucked-up shit
about you, man.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.882
What were they saying?

23:44.924 --> 23:47.718
Um... what do you care about?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.720
Like, in my life?

23:49.762 --> 23:51.097
Yeah.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.723
Like, my hobbies?

23:52.765 --> 23:54.350
Yeah, okay.

23:54.392 --> 23:57.687
Well, I collect and assemble
miniature train sets,

23:57.728 --> 24:00.857
tracks and small-scale
replica villages.

24:00.898 --> 24:03.693

that was fucked up.

Yeah.

24:09.448 --> 24:13.369

that was really fucked up.

-Like... What?

24:21.169 --> 24:24.881
Like, how is collecting and
assembling train kits fucked up?

24:24.922 --> 24:27.717
Like... all the ways.

24:27.758 --> 24:30.553
They were just really
down on it, man.

24:30.595 --> 24:33.222
EDWARD: They were so down
on train kits, man.

24:35.516 --> 24:38.102
-Fuck that.
-Yeah.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.312
Yeah.

24:39.353 --> 24:41.022
Fuck that, man.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.982

24:43.024 --> 24:44.859
The normal one.

24:44.901 --> 24:47.320

So when you're fucked up,
you should just go home
