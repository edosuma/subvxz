WEBVTT

00:02.379 --> 00:05.840
Do you want a lean body for summer?
Well, the time to start is now.

00:05.965 --> 00:09.678
No gimmicks, no crash diets,
and absolutely no drugs.

00:09.803 --> 00:11.596
Think healthy,
and be healthy.

00:11.721 --> 00:12.722
You can start now,

00:12.847 --> 00:16.184
just pick up the phone
and become the best you you can be.

00:16.309 --> 00:18.770
(MAN GROANS)
Cut! Going again.

00:18.895 --> 00:20.647
Sorry.
Did I mess up the commercial?

00:20.772 --> 00:22.148
No, it's fine.
Are you okay?

00:22.273 --> 00:24.776
I think it's cramps.
Oh! I'm burning on my side.

00:24.901 --> 00:27.320
Sit down, take a few minutes
and catch your breath.

00:27.445 --> 00:28.697
Everybody else,
keep running.

00:28.822 --> 00:29.656
We're not filming.

00:29.781 --> 00:32.283
We don't do this for the cameras,
we do it for ourselves.

00:32.409 --> 00:33.952
We can't go again
with him sitting there.

00:34.077 --> 00:37.622
Fine. But that felt phony.
At least let me get a little workout,

00:37.747 --> 00:39.457
maybe if I'm breathing
as hard as they are

00:39.582 --> 00:41.793
I won't seem like
such an evil taskmaster.

00:41.918 --> 00:43.586
All right, take five, guys.

00:43.712 --> 00:45.046
(SIGHS)

00:45.714 --> 00:46.756
How you feeling?

00:46.881 --> 00:48.133
I think I'm ready to do this.

00:48.258 --> 00:51.720
You sure? That's it.
That's the way to fight through.

00:51.845 --> 00:56.224
All right, concentrate on those knees,
lean into it and lift.

00:56.349 --> 00:58.977
- Lifting. Lifting. Lifting.
- Come on, push it!

00:59.102 --> 01:01.020
Come on,
you're almost at the top.

01:01.146 --> 01:04.482
Those eight steps are the difference
between fat and thin.

01:04.607 --> 01:10.113
Seven, six, five, four, one more.
Nice job!

01:10.238 --> 01:11.239
(LAUGHS)

01:11.364 --> 01:12.699
Feel that burn?

01:12.824 --> 01:14.659
That's your body
carving out its new shape.

01:14.826 --> 01:15.660
New shape.

01:15.785 --> 01:18.705
Don't sit, just take it slow
on the way down.

01:18.830 --> 01:20.206
On, boy.

01:21.124 --> 01:22.625
(EXHALES)

01:25.003 --> 01:26.421
Are you okay?

01:31.050 --> 01:32.010
(EXCLAIMS)

01:35.889 --> 01:37.223
You Okay?

02:18.264 --> 02:21.643
Any idea why we're getting
half as many requests for you as usual?

02:21.768 --> 02:23.311
Democrats' health care plan?

02:23.436 --> 02:26.022
At least we have one case
that looks intriguing.

02:26.147 --> 02:28.399
30-year-old fitness trainer
suddenly can't breathe,

02:28.525 --> 02:30.610
collapses
and breaks her ankle.

02:30.735 --> 02:34.280
That's it? You're not gonna argue
why this case is beneath you?

02:34.405 --> 02:36.991
No point, I'm in an elevator.
I can't run away.

02:37.116 --> 02:38.868
You can't run away anyway.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.537
That's just mean.

02:47.126 --> 02:48.795
Why are we
still together?

02:48.920 --> 02:51.047
We are going
to our office.

02:51.172 --> 02:55.385
Pronoun confusion, starts kicking in
once you pass the childbearing age.

02:55.510 --> 02:59.138
Now that's just mean.
My office was recently destroyed.

02:59.264 --> 03:02.100
I thought I'd use the office
of the doctor directly responsible.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.685
I think the patient
holding the gun to my head

03:03.810 --> 03:05.436
was actually the one
directly responsible.

03:05.562 --> 03:09.357
My desk won't fit in his cell.
You can use our outer office.

03:20.869 --> 03:22.787
Where's Foreman
and Thirteen?

03:22.912 --> 03:24.455
Own in the R .

03:24.581 --> 03:26.249
Thirteen started
her clinical trials today.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.667
What's Cuddy doing
in your office?

03:27.792 --> 03:29.502
Other than throwing off
the fang shui

03:29.627 --> 03:33.047
with her ass that faces
all eight sides of the Bagua at once?

03:33.172 --> 03:34.591
These walls
aren't soundproof.

03:34.716 --> 03:35.925
I'm well aware.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.927
Normal CT means
that her lung problem

03:38.052 --> 03:40.388
has the distinction of having
nothing to do with her lungs.

03:40.513 --> 03:43.516
Steroids. No one looks
this fit without cheating.

03:43.641 --> 03:45.852
Anabolic steroids
hack away at the immune system,

03:45.977 --> 03:48.229
left her open
to a pulmonary infection.

03:48.354 --> 03:52.442
Wow. Muscles and curves.
My penis is so confused.

03:52.567 --> 03:53.651
She's not on steroids.

03:53.776 --> 03:55.778
Her program's all about
getting in shape naturally,

03:55.904 --> 03:57.322
exercising, eating right.

03:57.447 --> 03:58.865
And you know this because?

03:58.990 --> 04:01.618
She has infomercials
to sell her DVDs.

04:01.743 --> 04:02.869
What? I'm up late a lot.

04:02.994 --> 04:06.164
And you actually believe
what you see on TV? Go run the labs.

04:06.289 --> 04:09.167
CUDDY: The labs are back
and there's no sign of steroid use.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.419
Can someone please
read her file?

04:11.544 --> 04:14.255
Can someone please stop
back seat differential-ating?

04:14.380 --> 04:15.506
KUTNER: What about allergies?

04:15.632 --> 04:18.718
She goes jogging every morning,
inhales car fumes during rush hour.

04:18.843 --> 04:22.889
Perfect, except that she was jogging
half a mile from the nearest road.

04:24.390 --> 04:25.850
In the cold.

04:25.975 --> 04:30.438
Cold air hits the lungs, sets off
an attack, exercise-induced asthma.

04:30.563 --> 04:34.025
Nice try, except EIA doesn't
account for the elevated BP.

04:34.150 --> 04:36.152
If you'd read the file...

04:36.277 --> 04:40.031
Come on, before the shrieking harpy
melts my brain.

04:43.368 --> 04:45.161
- Her BP's fine.
- I know.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.205
Exercise-induced
asthma actually fits.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.040
I know. You know.
She can't know.

04:49.165 --> 04:50.708
The only good way
to test for EIA

04:50.833 --> 04:52.961
is to recreate the conditions
in which the attack occurred.

04:53.086 --> 04:56.589
But we can't exactly make her
run out in the cold on a broken ankle.

04:56.714 --> 04:57.882
Get creative.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.709
It's gonna be okay.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.760
Any shortness of breath?
Tightness in your chest?

05:42.885 --> 05:44.095
Feeling pretty good,
actually.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.221
Not even
breathing hard.

05:45.346 --> 05:47.432
O2 sats and lung capacity
are still well within range.

05:47.557 --> 05:49.225
Cuffs slipping down,
you wanna stop for a moment?

05:49.350 --> 05:51.936
Rather not.
Haven't had any exercise in two days.

05:52.061 --> 05:54.022
Take it you don't get
a lot of fat in your diet.

05:54.147 --> 05:56.315
I take it from your tone
you think that's a bad thing.

05:56.441 --> 05:57.650
Do you ever indulge?

05:57.775 --> 06:00.194
There's more to life
than indulging your every whim.

06:00.319 --> 06:04.157
I didn't say "every." But a whim every
now and then can make life a little...

06:04.282 --> 06:05.783
You okay?
Trouble breathing?

06:05.908 --> 06:08.286
No, I feel fine. Why?

06:10.580 --> 06:12.331
(HEART MONITOR FLATLINING)

06:12.457 --> 06:16.294
No pulse.
This isn't asthma.

06:21.466 --> 06:23.384
There are a lot of other people
in the trial?

06:23.509 --> 06:27.680
I'm taking over the people that already
started it at Mercy, so I'm pretty full.

06:28.347 --> 06:29.849
Stop.

06:30.975 --> 06:33.352
One more time.
No talking.

06:36.731 --> 06:40.109
I shouldn't be here.
It's nepotism.

06:40.234 --> 06:43.112
I know the guy running the drug trial,
so I get a spot.

06:43.237 --> 06:47.658
You have Huntington's,
so you get a spot. Stop.

06:48.618 --> 06:52.038
One more time.
Just the fingers, no mouth.

06:55.291 --> 06:57.627
The point of this thing
is to improve neural cell longevity,

06:57.752 --> 06:59.170
which doesn't matter much
before symptoms,

06:59.295 --> 07:00.213
so you should give
my spot to someone...

07:00.338 --> 07:01.297
Shut up.

07:04.467 --> 07:05.843
Stop.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.388
You can stop
feeling guilty.

07:09.847 --> 07:13.559
Your best tapping rate
was .004 taps per millisecond.

07:14.685 --> 07:17.355
Means your nerves
have started degenerating.

07:33.496 --> 07:38.334
You want to work in here?
Fine. Me, too.

07:38.459 --> 07:43.172
We'll split the desk 50-50.
That side's yours, this side's mine.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.590
You're right.

07:45.299 --> 07:48.010
There's plenty of space here,
neither one of us needs all of it.

07:48.136 --> 07:52.557
That's your strategy? Taking
the high road? It's not going to work.

07:52.682 --> 07:54.642
Huh? Did you say something?

07:54.767 --> 07:58.354
I couldn't hear you from all the way
over here on my side of the desk.

07:58.479 --> 07:59.772
TAUB: Patient's heart stopped.

07:59.897 --> 08:02.233
We shocked her back to sinus rhythm,
she's stable.

08:02.358 --> 08:04.944
Test didn't set it off,
her EKG was normal.

08:07.738 --> 08:09.115
Well, she's consistent.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.659
Lung problems have nothing to do
with her lungs,

08:11.784 --> 08:14.078
heart problem that has nothing to do
with her heart.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.913
Something is
strangling her system.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.582
Carcinoid tumor.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.877
Find it, cut it out.

08:31.304 --> 08:33.347
Can a leaking breast implant
cause joint pain?

08:33.472 --> 08:36.642
No, and she clearly
doesn't have implants.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.853
Or joint pain. What's going on?

08:38.978 --> 08:40.646
Got another patient.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.608
I set up an online
second opinion clinic.

08:43.733 --> 08:46.611
People who don't like or trust
their doctors e-mail symptoms,

08:46.736 --> 08:49.280
I can knock off four or five cases
over lunch,

08:49.405 --> 08:51.574
clear two grand by e-mailing them back.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.201
Ascending colon's clean.

08:53.326 --> 08:54.452
That's gotta be illegal.

08:54.577 --> 08:57.163
Only in nine states,
and this isn't one of them.

08:57.288 --> 08:59.999
Legal notice spells out
it doesn't replace doctor's visits,

09:00.124 --> 09:02.001
so there's no opportunity
for malpractice.

09:02.126 --> 09:03.169
How come you haven't said
anything about this?

09:03.294 --> 09:05.796
It's no big secret.
I guess I'm just not very chatty.

09:05.922 --> 09:08.925
You told us when you renewed your
subscription to National Geographic.

09:09.050 --> 09:11.761
Small intestine looks clean,
moving into the pylorus.

09:11.886 --> 09:14.138
So you don't mind
if I tell House?

09:14.263 --> 09:16.182
Actually, House may sort of mind.

09:16.307 --> 09:19.143
Because I sort of set it up
in House's name.

09:20.019 --> 09:21.604
Nothing in the bile duct.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.732
And by "set it up in his name,"
you mean?

09:24.857 --> 09:27.526
I mean, it's Dr. Gregory House's
Second Opinion Clinic

09:27.652 --> 09:31.280
with medical advice
direct from Dr. Gregory House.

09:31.405 --> 09:34.617
You're insane.
With two days to live.

09:34.742 --> 09:35.743
House's never gonna find out.

09:35.868 --> 09:37.370
He will if I tell him.

09:38.537 --> 09:42.208
Or you cut me in for 30%,
and I keep your secret safe.

09:42.333 --> 09:43.626
That's blackmail.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.002
Yes.

09:46.712 --> 09:49.799
Moving into the... Whoa.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.970
That's her stomach?
It's the size of a shot glass.

09:54.095 --> 09:58.349
Because our patient's
a big, fat cheater.

10:03.771 --> 10:07.566
Subtle. No way you geniuses
could have spotted this.

10:07.692 --> 10:10.653
Gastric bypass surgery,
she had her stomach stapled,

10:10.778 --> 10:12.989
then had the records
from her files pulled

10:13.114 --> 10:14.949
so it wouldn't ruin her DVD sales.

10:15.074 --> 10:17.034
Can you do this outside?

10:17.159 --> 10:20.413
I could. But that would defeat
the purpose of doing it here.

10:21.414 --> 10:22.832
Where are the smart guys?

10:22.957 --> 10:24.292
If you mean
Foreman and Thirteen,

10:24.417 --> 10:27.586
apparently the first appointment
of the drug trial is an all-day thing.

10:27.712 --> 10:28.879
I said yes to this?

10:29.005 --> 10:30.214
Her gastric bypass
procedure could cause...

10:30.339 --> 10:33.217
Forget the bypass,
treat her like a fat girl.

10:33.342 --> 10:35.970
Should we treat her like
a 60-year-old Asian man, too?

10:36.095 --> 10:37.179
She's not fat.

10:37.305 --> 10:41.392
Not on the outside, but on the inside
she's still tons of fun.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.646
When she was obese,
she probably had Type 2 diabetes,

10:45.771 --> 10:47.398
could have left her
with permanent nerve damage.

10:47.523 --> 10:52.153
Ten points for doing what I said,
minus ten points for doing it badly.

10:52.278 --> 10:55.865
If this was diabetes-induced nerve
damage, it would've kicked in years ago.

10:55.990 --> 10:57.408
Have you seen my balls?

10:59.910 --> 11:01.829
Can you hold on a second?

11:01.954 --> 11:06.042
My balls. Have you seen my balls?
The giant one and the red one.

11:06.167 --> 11:07.209
Your plan isn't
going to work.

11:07.335 --> 11:08.544
Of course it is.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.463
I try to make you miserable
to make you leave.

11:10.588 --> 11:12.048
You deny that it's
making you miserable,

11:12.173 --> 11:14.633
you try to make me miserable
so I'll stop making you miserable.

11:14.759 --> 11:16.135
And eventually you will leave,

11:16.260 --> 11:18.429
citing reasons
that have nothing to do with misery.

11:18.554 --> 11:20.264
You're not bothering me.

11:20.389 --> 11:22.516
Step one, complete.

11:22.641 --> 11:28.397
I'm gonna call you from my cell.
And then I will come back in here.

11:28.898 --> 11:32.193
Hey. Yeah, I just had to explain
to him that I had his balls,

11:32.318 --> 11:35.780
and he's not getting them back.
Excuse me.

11:35.905 --> 11:37.198
Sleep apnea explains...

11:37.323 --> 11:39.283
Apnea would've disappeared
when she shrank.

11:39.408 --> 11:42.119
Not if it destroyed
the musculature of her trachea.

11:42.244 --> 11:44.872
Apnea cuts off oxygen to the brain,
the resulting neurological damage...

11:44.997 --> 11:46.123
She been snoring?

11:46.248 --> 11:47.249
She didn't mention it.

11:47.375 --> 11:50.127
Did she mention feeling tired
after a full night's sleep?

11:50.252 --> 11:51.087
No, but...

11:51.212 --> 11:52.713
HOUSE: This isn't apnea.

11:53.381 --> 11:56.300
And this is a stupid room
to be doing a DDX in.

12:02.056 --> 12:07.645
Cliff notes. Gastric bypass
only makes her skinny on the outside.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.814
On the inside
we have heart and lung issues

12:09.939 --> 12:11.524
not caused by heart and lung issues.

12:11.649 --> 12:13.818
Private area, House.
It can wait.

12:13.943 --> 12:16.320
You need to consider side-effects
from her gastric bypass surgery.

12:16.445 --> 12:17.655
KUTNER: Forget the bypass.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.490
Let the dying girl finish.

12:19.615 --> 12:21.450
- You said forget the bypass...
- Shh.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.911
Dr. Thirteen
has the floor.

12:24.036 --> 12:27.289
Bypass could create malabsorption
issues, leads to low potassium.

12:27.415 --> 12:29.834
Very stupid.
Her potassium is fine.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.420
But her intestines aren't.

12:32.545 --> 12:36.298
Gastric bypass could cause malabsorption
by creating a blind loop of bowel.

12:36.424 --> 12:39.009
It ulcerates during exercise,
bacteria get loose in the blood stream,

12:39.135 --> 12:40.469
migrate to the heart and lungs.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.388
Very not stupid.

12:42.513 --> 12:45.641
Bacteria in the bowels means
there's bacteria in the poop.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.518
Get some and test it.

12:47.643 --> 12:50.062
He could have come up with SIBO
anywhere else in the hospital.

12:50.187 --> 12:52.106
You didn't need to come down here
and screw with us.

12:52.231 --> 12:55.568
But her wrong idea led to his right one.
It was a vital screwing.

12:57.570 --> 13:00.739
We think your surgery might have caused
an infection called SIBO.

13:00.865 --> 13:06.412
A stool test will help us to confirm.
Put some of what you're full of in here.

13:07.746 --> 13:12.042
If surgery could somehow
make you taller, wouldn't you do it?

13:13.294 --> 13:17.256
Sure, but I wouldn't call a meeting
of the Lollipop Guild

13:17.381 --> 13:19.884
and tell them they can grow
if they work real hard at it.

13:20.009 --> 13:22.052
I don't tell anyone
not to get gastric bypass.

13:22.178 --> 13:25.222
I tell them how to get healthy,
how to improve their lives.

13:25.347 --> 13:27.975
Yeah, by telling them to do
what you were unwilling to.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.685
I was willing
to do anything.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.980
Thyroid hormones, crash diets,
none of it worked.

13:33.105 --> 13:35.024
My body was
like a prison.

13:35.149 --> 13:40.613
When I got the surgery, I got healthy
and when I got healthy, I got happy.

13:42.031 --> 13:43.574
I'm not sure you're happy.

13:43.699 --> 13:47.203
But if you are, being healthy
didn't do it, being pretty did.

13:47.328 --> 13:48.746
Poop in the bedpan.

13:50.581 --> 13:53.042
House's office? Really?

13:53.167 --> 13:55.586
Did he send you here
to beg for it back?

13:55.711 --> 13:57.087
There are dozens
of other doctors...

13:57.213 --> 14:00.883
Other doctors actually use their offices
for crazy stuff like seeing patients,

14:01.008 --> 14:03.469
not throwing a ball against the wall
and calling it work.

14:03.594 --> 14:05.763
It's his process.
That ball saves lives.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.640
Did he give you
talking points?

14:07.765 --> 14:09.600
Yeah, but I added
one of my own.

14:09.725 --> 14:14.146
Don't take his office and pretend like
all you're doing is taking his office.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.607
You chose his room
because you want to be there.

14:16.732 --> 14:20.736
But sitting near him and hoping
isn't going to get it done.

14:22.947 --> 14:26.700
Leave here now
or I'll take your office.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.410
No, you won't.

14:32.373 --> 14:35.668
The boob lady e-mailed me again,
complaining of chronic fatigue now.

14:35.793 --> 14:38.003
She's convinced
the implants are responsible.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.588
- They're not.
- I told her.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.924
She says something is
and if I don't find out what

14:42.049 --> 14:44.260
she's gonna complain
to the Licensing Board.

14:44.385 --> 14:45.803
- It's not funny.
- It is.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.931
You just can't appreciate it because
it's going to destroy your career.

14:49.932 --> 14:53.769
What happened? Did he call Foreman
clean and articulate again?

14:53.894 --> 14:55.062
It is surprising.

14:55.187 --> 14:57.565
Clinic patient's
just whining.

14:57.690 --> 14:58.732
What's the poop?

14:58.857 --> 15:00.734
It's going to take about an hour
to spin down the sample.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.486
What are we looking for?

15:02.611 --> 15:04.196
You don't know?

15:04.321 --> 15:08.367
I'm doing my famous Socrates impression.
Think I really nailed the accent.

15:08.492 --> 15:10.703
High fat content
indicates SIBO.

15:10.828 --> 15:13.330
And what does
fat do in water?

15:13.455 --> 15:14.373
It floats.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.125
And what else
floats in water?

15:19.753 --> 15:22.131
The correct answer is a duck.

15:23.549 --> 15:26.927
If it doesn't float,
Kutner missed the boat.

15:35.436 --> 15:38.230
Looks like I was wrong
to dismiss apnea.

15:38.355 --> 15:41.817
You guys can stay up all night
gloating in the sleep lab.

15:47.448 --> 15:50.284
KUTNER: What about all that scar tissue
around the implant, could that be...

15:50.409 --> 15:52.494
That amount of encapsulation
is perfectly normal.

15:52.620 --> 15:53.662
I gotta tell her something.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.248
Tell her to find a decent plastic
surgeon who can correct the placement...

15:56.373 --> 15:58.876
Yeah, that's what she wants to hear,
she's sick and she's lopsided.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.210
Tell her it's a virus.

16:00.336 --> 16:02.796
It probably is, and it'll
get her off your back for a few...

16:02.921 --> 16:04.715
Emmy's EEG is flat-lining.

16:07.509 --> 16:08.761
Where would she have gone?

Hey, I looked for you guys in
the control room, but you seemed busy.

16:16.352 --> 16:19.188
Get off of there, last time you
exercised you had a cardiac incident.

16:19.313 --> 16:21.357
- I feel fine.
- You felt fine last time.

16:21.482 --> 16:23.567
I only slept a couple of hours
but I feel great.

16:23.692 --> 16:24.693
Can I get
one of those machines?

16:24.818 --> 16:26.028
You're running on
a broken ankle.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.154
EMMY: It doesn't hurt.

16:27.279 --> 16:28.572
And your leg is bleeding.

16:34.745 --> 16:36.497
You feel that?

16:36.622 --> 16:37.581
What does that mean?

16:43.128 --> 16:45.673
The numbness in her left foot
is ascending into her leg.

16:45.798 --> 16:48.258
How'd she manage
to sneak out for a run?

16:48.384 --> 16:51.011
She said she needed
to use the bathroom.

16:51.136 --> 16:53.639
You two get the results
of the sleep apnea test,

16:53.764 --> 16:55.265
or did those need to use
the bathroom, too?

16:55.391 --> 16:57.726
Alpha waves on the EEG
ruled it out.

on my side.

Oh! Would you look
at the time?

17:13.992 --> 17:17.538
I hope your patient isn't still sick,
forcing you to stay here all night.

17:22.251 --> 17:23.877
Ascending numbness means
her nerves are breaking down.

17:24.002 --> 17:24.837

Or her brain.

17:24.962 --> 17:27.005
- Or both.

I'll meet you down there.

You were 15 minutes late yesterday.
I don't want you to develop bad habits.

17:32.761 --> 17:33.721
Appreciate the life lesson,

17:33.846 --> 17:36.432
but 15 minutes, give or take,
isn't going to make a difference.

17:36.557 --> 17:40.144
Get started on your other patients,
I'll be down there when we're done here.

17:40.269 --> 17:43.522
Way to know where your bread
is buttered, sister. Up high.

17:43.647 --> 17:45.482
If the problem is in her brain,
it could be MS.

17:45.607 --> 17:46.775
Or early onset Parkinson's.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.778
But if it's her nerves,
it could be transverse myelitis.

We're gonna stay in the dark

is in her power station

17:56.702 --> 17:59.246
or in the high tension wires.

18:00.956 --> 18:06.545
Power station's the brain,

you've never done anything hypocritical?

Does this mean something is wrong
with my nerves?

19:16.281 --> 19:19.451
No. It's your muscles.

We don't need to run this test.
It's not what we thought.

19:45.644 --> 19:48.355
She has muscle weakness,
could indicate myasthenia gravis.

Yeah.

Also could be
some kind of toxin.

to the personnel floors?

19:53.610 --> 19:55.779

She has sleeves of tattoos and piercings
from God knows where.

20:25.851 --> 20:29.605

could indicate myasthenia gravis.

the test in a reasonable amount of time

20:36.862 --> 20:39.740

It's not myasthenia gravis,

All that is needed for evil to succeed
is for good men to do nothing.

21:11.521 --> 21:13.440
She probably used a lot of Botox
to tighten up her skin.

21:13.565 --> 21:17.611
True. Could also be

every time I walk into that place.

That's understandable.

to get over it.

Your wife?

24:13.787 --> 24:15.747
Does it worry you
that she paged Kutner first?

24:15.872 --> 24:19.459
Guillain-Barré fits, patient
didn't notice the initial symptoms

24:19.584 --> 24:22.212
because it's no different
than how she feels every day.

24:22.337 --> 24:25.423
Her muscle weakness
is the precursor to full paralysis.

24:26.633 --> 24:29.094
Gastric bypass
probably set it off.

24:30.262 --> 24:34.516
At what price beauty?
Go start her on plasmapheresis.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.608
(SINGING)
<i>She put the lime in the coconut</i>

24:43.733 --> 24:45.193
<i>She drank it all up</i>

24:45.318 --> 24:48.572
<i>She put the lime in the coconut
She drank it all up</i>

24:48.697 --> 24:52.534
Deedee?
Can you stop singing?

24:52.659 --> 24:56.413
CAMERON: Musical automatism, she could
be having a partial seizure right now.

24:56.538 --> 24:57.455
You need to get House.

24:57.581 --> 24:58.707
Deedee!

24:58.832 --> 25:01.126
Yelling at her is not gonna be
an effective treatment.

25:01.251 --> 25:03.545
She's faking.
It's a cry for attention.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.005
Her brain could be misfiring.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.924
Right, a rare neurological disorder
is far more likely

25:08.049 --> 25:09.217
than a cry for attention.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.511
I mean, nothing about this woman
screams "look at me."

25:11.636 --> 25:14.097
On the other hand,
look at her.

25:14.347 --> 25:15.807
(CONTINUES SINGING)

25:16.099 --> 25:20.812
She needs a full neurological work-up.
Get House.

25:23.398 --> 25:24.524
(SIGHS)

25:25.025 --> 25:28.695
Ultimate irony. I killed myself
trying to make myself healthy.

25:28.820 --> 25:31.990
You're not dying, okay?
This disease is manageable.

25:34.242 --> 25:36.077
Better start getting used
to that wheelchair.

25:36.203 --> 25:37.495
Self-pity doesn't suit you.

25:37.621 --> 25:38.705
Just take me down to the...

25:38.830 --> 25:42.500
No.
You're strong enough to walk.

25:42.626 --> 25:45.420
Come on, get your ass
out of bed and walk.

25:58.475 --> 26:01.311
Could be an aneurysm,
we've got to control her blood pressure,

26:01.436 --> 26:03.188
start her on
a calcium channel blocker.

26:03.313 --> 26:05.774
Or you could tell House.

26:05.899 --> 26:07.359
I can't tell House.

26:07.484 --> 26:08.818
You'll be in trouble.

26:08.944 --> 26:10.612
On the other hand,
she's sick.

26:10.737 --> 26:11.780
She's singing.

26:11.905 --> 26:14.991
And bleeding out of her ears
and losing her hair.

26:15.116 --> 26:16.701
And an aneurysm doesn't explain
her joint pain.

26:16.826 --> 26:17.869
Wilson's disease does.

26:17.994 --> 26:19.287
No Kayser-Fleischer rings.

26:19.412 --> 26:20.330
Anorexia.

26:20.455 --> 26:21.748
Now you're just desperate.

26:21.873 --> 26:25.085
Biliary tumor causing
paraneoplastic syndrome.

26:26.711 --> 26:30.298
That might actually fit.
I'll scan to confirm.

26:31.341 --> 26:33.260
- You'd do that for me?
- You don't have the time.

26:33.385 --> 26:37.681
Which means I can ask for 25%
of your income and you'll give it to me.

26:46.898 --> 26:49.150
You going over the fence?

26:49.276 --> 26:52.570
It took three visits,
but I finally convinced the contractor

26:52.696 --> 26:57.075
that I'm Cuddy's boss and all the office
renovation plans need to go through me.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.286
You did do the math
on this, right?

26:59.411 --> 27:01.788
Screwing with her office
means her renovations will take longer,

27:01.913 --> 27:03.915
means she'll be
in your office longer.

27:04.040 --> 27:08.795
See there? I'm having a bidet put in
instead of a toilet.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.548
Not in addition to,
instead of.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.633
You want to know
what happened to the old toilet?

27:13.758 --> 27:17.304
She'll be with you
where you claim to not want her.

27:17.429 --> 27:21.224
I smashed it
with a sledgehammer.

27:21.349 --> 27:23.518
I think
in some ancient cultures

27:23.643 --> 27:26.396
that was actually considered
a proposal of marriage.

27:27.522 --> 27:32.485
Is this fun for you?
Analyzing everyone else's fun away?

27:32.610 --> 27:35.572
Ask her out,
it'll cost the hospital a lot less.

27:40.535 --> 27:43.246
I brought some visitors.
Cheer you up.

27:44.789 --> 27:47.125
It's okay,
come on in, guys.

27:47.250 --> 27:49.669
We're all staying on your plan.
Nobody's cheating.

27:49.794 --> 27:53.673
That's great.
You're on my arm.

27:53.798 --> 27:58.386
We found out about your gastric bypass.
How could you lie to us like that?

27:58.511 --> 28:01.348
The doctors told you?
You're really hurting my arm.

28:01.473 --> 28:04.267
You're not the best you
you can be.

28:04.976 --> 28:08.229
You're a fraud.
You're a self-hating fat person.

28:08.355 --> 28:09.522
(CRYING) You're really hurting me.

28:09.647 --> 28:11.024
Feel the burn.

28:11.149 --> 28:13.693
ALL: Burn. Burn.

28:13.818 --> 28:15.153
EMMY: Help. Help!

28:15.278 --> 28:18.031
ALL: Burn. Burn! Burn!

28:18.156 --> 28:19.741
- Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!
- Help!

28:19.866 --> 28:21.368
(EMMY SCREAMING)

28:21.910 --> 28:25.497
Get off of me!
Get off of me! Get off of me!

28:33.213 --> 28:35.173
TAUB: Mood congruent
hallucinations.

28:35.298 --> 28:36.716
KUTNER: Means it's not
Guillain-Barré.

28:36.841 --> 28:39.552
Which means whatever it is,
it's now in her brain.

28:42.389 --> 28:43.390
Where are you going?

28:43.515 --> 28:45.558
Sorry. Treatment.

28:45.683 --> 28:48.770
Does Foreman schedule your appointments
by numbers on the clock,

28:48.895 --> 28:50.605
or just by when
I'm in the middle of something?

28:50.730 --> 28:54.526
Sorry if I'm dying at a bad time
for you. Could be CNS lymphoma.

28:54.651 --> 28:57.237
So losing the 200 pounds
was just a coincidence?

29:01.324 --> 29:03.034
What about a prion disease?

29:05.370 --> 29:07.831
If her brain is slowly turning
into a Swiss cheese,

29:07.956 --> 29:09.874
there's not a lot
we can do.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.752
There are some
possible treatments.

29:12.877 --> 29:14.796
Get a brain biopsy to confirm.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.632
You are not cutting
into this woman's brain before you test.

29:17.757 --> 29:19.717
That is the test.

29:21.678 --> 29:25.265
Not for CNS lymphoma, which is
a perfectly legitimate diagnosis,

29:25.390 --> 29:27.600
one you can test for non-invasively.

29:27.725 --> 29:29.769
You're, obviously,
not opposed to being invasive.

29:29.894 --> 29:34.607
Rule out CNS lymphoma first,
then rule out astrocytoma,

29:34.732 --> 29:36.317
then rule out
other brain tumors...

29:36.443 --> 29:37.610
(BLOWS)

29:37.735 --> 29:40.405
I hereby declare them
ruled out.

29:40.530 --> 29:41.865
Run the tests.

29:41.990 --> 29:44.742
You can do a brain biopsy,
but only as a last resort.

29:48.204 --> 29:51.708
Start running down Cuddy's list
of "Diseases it's not."

29:58.381 --> 30:00.633
You're not stopping me
for medical reasons.

30:02.719 --> 30:06.431
You're stopping me
because you have the hots for me.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.854
You're still here
because you have the hots for me.

30:12.979 --> 30:16.316
Evidenced by the fact that
I'm the one who moved into your office.

30:16.441 --> 30:18.318
It's the biggest office.
And I'm not the one that...

30:18.443 --> 30:22.989
Why are you dressed like that? Why do
you try so hard to get my attention?

30:24.908 --> 30:27.076
Are you screwing with me?

30:27.202 --> 30:29.204
Are you screwing with me?

30:30.079 --> 30:31.247
Depends on your answer.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.296
Everybody knows
this is going somewhere.

30:41.758 --> 30:44.886
I think we're supposed
to kiss now.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.304
We already did that.

30:56.689 --> 30:58.483
Seemed like the
logical next step.

30:58.608 --> 30:59.734
Really?

31:03.112 --> 31:05.323
I'm an idiot
for being surprised.

31:08.785 --> 31:10.328
Can you leave these?

31:36.813 --> 31:38.147
(SIGHS)

31:39.607 --> 31:42.193
I'll keep coming.
But can you change my appointment time?

31:42.318 --> 31:44.404
Can't. Schedule's full.

31:45.863 --> 31:48.866
You're stuck with her,
might as well get to know her.

32:38.583 --> 32:41.502
Your head MRI was clean,
means you don't have CNS lymphoma.

32:41.628 --> 32:42.670
What's next on the list?

32:42.795 --> 32:44.839
Other types
of brain tumors.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.132
Can we stop
at the cafeteria?

32:46.257 --> 32:47.342
I can have something
brought up for you.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.677
- What do you want?
- Chocolate cake.

32:54.974 --> 32:57.602
You can't give up.
We're going to figure this out.

32:57.727 --> 33:01.105
What am I supposed to be hoping for?
That you find a brain tumor?

33:02.357 --> 33:03.566
What else could it be?

33:05.026 --> 33:07.737
You were so hard on me
about lying.

33:07.862 --> 33:11.032
How about you take some of
your own advice and tell me the truth?

33:11.949 --> 33:13.368
What's next on the list?

33:15.620 --> 33:17.413
Prion disease.

33:18.623 --> 33:20.875
And if that's what I got?
How bad?

33:21.709 --> 33:25.421
There are a few treatments.
But there's no guarantee.

33:27.548 --> 33:28.591
I'm sorry.

33:32.095 --> 33:34.430
And you won't let me
have a piece of cake?

33:48.820 --> 33:50.238
(DOOR OPENING)

33:50.905 --> 33:52.824
Where's Cuddy?

33:53.950 --> 33:55.368
It's not CNS lymphoma.

33:55.493 --> 33:56.577
I know.

33:57.453 --> 33:58.996
She's getting worse,
you want me to find Cuddy

33:59.122 --> 34:01.332
and get her approval
for the brain biopsy?

34:02.458 --> 34:07.880
When you were philandering
with impunity, how did that feel?

34:09.090 --> 34:15.430
Superficially, I loved it,
but deep down I think I was miserable.

34:15.555 --> 34:17.598
Why? What's going on?

34:17.724 --> 34:18.808
You weren't miserable.

34:22.145 --> 34:24.772
You gave something away
to make a relationship work,

34:24.897 --> 34:27.525
you rationalized
that you're getting something back.

34:29.444 --> 34:33.197
Okay. I'm gonna go get Cuddy's approval
for the brain biopsy.

34:33.322 --> 34:36.409
Leave them there.
I'm gonna do the biopsy myself.

34:40.037 --> 34:42.248
Cuddy wanted us to eliminate
seven different things.

34:42.373 --> 34:44.125
Cuddy doesn't always
get what she wants.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.627
Bad idea to get into a power play
with somebody who has the power.

34:46.753 --> 34:50.715
You're fired.
Just reinforcing your point.

34:50.840 --> 34:54.594
Whatever personal drama you're playing
out, you'd be a lot smarter to...

34:56.929 --> 34:58.765
I thought you said
she was sick.

35:06.314 --> 35:09.984
Sick people don't
spontaneously get better.

35:10.109 --> 35:12.737
Yes, they do,
it's called an immune system.

35:13.529 --> 35:16.574
Sick people who are sick enough
to make it to me

35:16.699 --> 35:18.075
don't spontaneously
get better.

35:18.201 --> 35:21.537
Not as pithy, but yeah,
technically more accurate.

35:22.079 --> 35:23.706
What's the last thing
you gave her?

35:23.831 --> 35:25.500
I took her for a MRI
looking for...

35:25.625 --> 35:27.752
MRIs detect,
they don't treat.

35:27.877 --> 35:29.462
What did you give her
after the MRI?

35:29.587 --> 35:33.132
I didn't give her anything, she got
depressed at the lack of direction.

35:33.257 --> 35:35.593
We went to the cafeteria
for some chocolate cake,

35:35.718 --> 35:38.888
took her to her room,
hung a banana bag, let her rest.

35:40.932 --> 35:42.767
You gave her cake?

35:42.892 --> 35:44.143
She asked for it,
I figured...

35:44.268 --> 35:47.605
You figured you'd let me play
20 questions instead of just telling me.

35:57.657 --> 36:01.786
Feeling crappy again?
I've brought your cure.

36:05.581 --> 36:07.124
I'd give you an IV
of the stuff,

36:07.250 --> 36:10.920
but the frosting tends to get stuck
in the little tube.

36:11.045 --> 36:12.171
Is this a joke?

36:12.296 --> 36:16.551
It's not a joke, not a lie,
not an attempt to defraud in any way.

36:16.676 --> 36:21.389
Just an actual licensed physician
with an actual diagnosis.

36:21.514 --> 36:23.975
Hereditary coproporphyria.

36:28.437 --> 36:34.026
Your face is genetically blessed,
your body chemistry is slightly less so,

36:35.570 --> 36:38.531
doesn't make enough of a certain enzyme
that I can't pronounce,

36:38.656 --> 36:42.159
but it's apparently important
for your liver and everything else.

36:42.285 --> 36:44.704
Treatment is a high-carb diet,
rich in sugar.

36:44.829 --> 36:47.957
When you were a porker,
you were self-medicating.

36:48.708 --> 36:50.042
So this is treatable?

36:50.167 --> 36:52.003
We just have to reverse
your gastric bypass

36:52.128 --> 36:54.881
and get you back on a high-carb,
glucose enriched diet.

36:55.006 --> 36:58.384
The best you you can be
is a lot more you.

36:59.218 --> 37:02.847
Open the hangar,
here comes the plane.

37:02.972 --> 37:04.974
There's nothing else
you can try?

37:05.099 --> 37:09.812
No. There's a drug that manages
the symptoms but it's not a cure.

37:10.855 --> 37:12.315
Let's try that.

37:16.444 --> 37:18.571
You don't want to have
the surgery?

37:22.491 --> 37:23.743
Understand.

37:25.119 --> 37:27.038
There's not many people
who have the guts to admit

37:27.163 --> 37:29.540
they'd rather be pretty than healthy.

37:29.665 --> 37:32.084
Income's better
and you get more action.

37:33.377 --> 37:36.047
We'll start you
on your drug treatment right away.

37:37.965 --> 37:39.300
(SIGHS)

37:41.802 --> 37:43.930
I bought it.
I bought that it was really about

37:44.055 --> 37:45.681
trying to make people's lives
a little better.

37:45.806 --> 37:47.058
You're surprised
she's superficial?

37:47.183 --> 37:49.769
You're a plastic surgeon.
This is the human condition.

37:49.894 --> 37:51.228
No, she's a freak.

37:51.354 --> 37:53.272
Every time you put someone under
to bob their nose,

37:53.397 --> 37:54.899
you were
risking their life.

37:56.192 --> 37:57.568
What?

37:57.693 --> 37:59.695
No singing. She's better.

38:06.035 --> 38:07.787
No one was supposed
to let my patient leave her bed.

38:07.912 --> 38:09.080
She had
a respiratory arrest,

38:09.205 --> 38:12.124
we coded her nearly 20 minutes,
but she didn't make it.

38:15.836 --> 38:19.465
House is an unemotional child
incapable of intimacy or romance.

38:19.590 --> 38:21.634
Trust me.
It's done.

38:21.759 --> 38:23.219
It's perfect.

38:25.680 --> 38:28.724
I like the desk.
A lot of character.

38:29.892 --> 38:31.602
That's not the one
I ordered.

38:34.230 --> 38:36.440
This is my desk
from med school.

38:37.817 --> 38:39.276
You have it in storage
or something?

38:39.402 --> 38:41.570
My mom did.

38:41.696 --> 38:43.656
That was sweet of her
to do that.

38:43.781 --> 38:48.035
She didn't. My mom has no idea
I'm redoing my office.

39:05.261 --> 39:07.221
I lied to you
the other night.

39:09.223 --> 39:14.020
That woman in the waiting room,
she didn't freak me out about my future.

39:16.022 --> 39:19.150
She freaked me out
about my past.

39:20.943 --> 39:22.445
Your mother.

39:24.030 --> 39:26.699
Must have been horrible
watching her die.

39:27.575 --> 39:29.368
I wanted her to die.

39:33.372 --> 39:38.169
She just yelled so much.

39:39.545 --> 39:43.215
And for no reason. Just screamed at me
in front of my friends.

39:45.551 --> 39:49.513
My father tried to explain to me
that her brain was literally shrinking,

39:49.638 --> 39:54.310
that she didn't mean it,
that it was the disease.

39:54.435 --> 39:55.853
But I didn't care.

39:58.898 --> 40:00.608
I hated her.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.532
I never said goodbye,

40:10.576 --> 40:14.121
and she died
with me hating her.

40:24.507 --> 40:26.008
(SIGHS)

40:30.304 --> 40:32.556
TAUB: Did Chase test
for the biliary tumor?

40:32.681 --> 40:34.642
He said it was negative.

40:34.767 --> 40:37.770
She was stable
when he left her.

40:37.895 --> 40:39.688
We should have found more time,
we should have...

40:39.814 --> 40:41.732
House is gonna kill us.

40:43.442 --> 40:45.152
Slowly

40:47.029 --> 40:48.489
and painfully.

40:50.199 --> 40:55.287
You're not only idiots, you're frauds.
Fraudulent idiots.

40:55.412 --> 40:58.332
Fraudulent idiotic killers,
as it turns out.

40:59.125 --> 41:01.293
- House, this was really my...
- Your fault, yeah!

41:01.418 --> 41:03.712
For pretending to be me
when you're not even competent.

41:03.838 --> 41:07.591
And your fault for not ratting him out
while the patient was still alive.

41:09.552 --> 41:15.766
What she had was easily treatable,
she could have been fine.

41:16.225 --> 41:18.102
Damn treatment's so simple.

41:21.272 --> 41:23.274
It might still be possible.

41:23.399 --> 41:25.276
KUTNER: House?

41:25.401 --> 41:29.196
House?
House, she's clearly dead.

41:30.781 --> 41:31.615
(GASPS)

41:31.740 --> 41:34.076
Oh, God! Oh, God!

41:35.870 --> 41:36.745
She was dead.

41:36.871 --> 41:40.416
She wasn't dead.
She wasn't even sick, you moron.

41:40.541 --> 41:41.417
(CHUCKLING)

41:41.542 --> 41:45.296
Seriously, how good was she? No
formal training. At least not in acting.

41:45.421 --> 41:46.589
Did you see their faces?

41:46.714 --> 41:49.216
I think we may have
an anal hygiene violation there.

41:49.341 --> 41:51.051
So the CT?

41:51.177 --> 41:54.805
That was from a patient three years ago.
That was hard to find.

41:54.930 --> 41:56.348
But the hair, makeup,

41:56.473 --> 41:59.894
getting Chase and Cameron
to play along, much easier.

42:00.019 --> 42:03.314
We deserved it.
I'll take down the website before...

42:03.439 --> 42:06.984
Take it down? You kidding?
It's way too lucrative to shut it down.

42:07.109 --> 42:09.361
For Chase, for me.

42:10.404 --> 42:13.407
I earn 50% for letting
you use my name.

42:14.742 --> 42:17.578
Chop, chop, go to work,
first dollars go to expenses.

42:17.703 --> 42:20.456
I booked our little thespian
here for two full days.

42:20.581 --> 42:21.916
That's three G's I owe her.

42:25.419 --> 42:27.713
And you still got
three hours left.

42:29.465 --> 42:30.633
Do I?
