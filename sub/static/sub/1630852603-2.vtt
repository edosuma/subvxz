Hey, excuse me!

00:32.991 --> 00:34.784
You, uh,
you can't smoke up there.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.411
I'm sorry, sir.
It's a fire hazard.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.412
You gotta put that out.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.788
You must be
the guy renting the place

00:38.872 --> 00:40.081
from Gil since he's out of town.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.082
Is that right?

00:41.166 --> 00:42.751
Yeah, sounds about right.
Airbnb?

00:42.751 --> 00:45.295
Oh, no, no, Gil's not supposed
to be doing Airbnb.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.630
That's--that goes against
the covenant there.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.049
Yeah, I'll have to have a chat
with Gil, but...

01:04.606 --> 01:06.316
No, man.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.942
I couldn't live in New York.

01:08.026 --> 01:09.444
No way. That...

01:09.444 --> 01:12.071
Taking those taxicabs
and all those people.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.531
Yeah, no. It's a...

I'm trying not to be rude here,

01:21.623 --> 01:23.958
but this conversation

01:24.042 --> 01:26.002

to do some work.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.378
And I can't concentrate.

01:27.462 --> 01:28.838
You made me put out
my cigarette.

That nasty attitude,

We got some good news for ya!

02:56.843 --> 02:58.636
- What if he's sleeping?
- Man, fuck his sleep.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.263
This is more important.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.265
Daddy?

03:03.516 --> 03:04.934
Daddy.

03:05.018 --> 03:05.977
Hey.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.103
Your eye.

03:07.103 --> 03:09.272
- Oh.
- Did you fall, Dr. Gemstone?

03:09.272 --> 03:10.565
Home falls are
a common occurrence

03:10.565 --> 03:11.608

03:11.608 --> 03:12.650
There's no shame in it.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.235
What is with all the racket?

03:14.319 --> 03:15.695
You're gonna wake the roosters!

03:15.695 --> 03:16.779
Oh.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.072
Sorry, I didn't know
you had company.

03:18.156 --> 03:21.326
I'd've worn something
more appropriate.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.328
Who's this hot piece of tail?

03:23.328 --> 03:24.746
This is my daughter, Judy.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.581
Excuse me.

03:26.581 --> 03:27.999
This one of her girlfriends?

03:27.999 --> 03:29.250
I'm not a lesbian partner.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.376
I'm her husband, BJ.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.128
No, BJ,
you're not shaking his hand.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.588
He's big dicking you.
- Oh.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.340
This is Junior,
an old friend from Memphis.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.799
Just visiting.

03:36.883 --> 03:37.842
Daddy.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.802
Sir--Dr. Gemstone.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.513
As you know,
I've wholeheartedly accepted

03:42.597 --> 03:45.308
Christ into my life
and decided to get baptized.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.684
I think I drunkenly said

03:46.768 --> 03:49.437
the exact same thing
to Eli last night.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.195
Cut the shit, bro.

03:57.195 --> 04:00.782
We came over here
to bestow upon you the honor

04:00.782 --> 04:03.785
of asking you to be the one
to baptize BJ.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.620
Instead we're standing here
looking at this boy

04:05.620 --> 04:07.205
with his fucking morning chub?

04:07.205 --> 04:08.915
Uh, excuse me, Eli.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.917
I don't mean
to interrupt this sweet...

04:10.917 --> 04:14.128
father-daughter moment,
but you got any hangover helper?

04:14.212 --> 04:15.672
Oh, the kitchen's in there.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.508
And the coffee machine
is on the counter.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.344
Ew.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.514
- Bye.
- No, don't peace sign him.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.060
What the fuck is that?

04:29.060 --> 04:33.481
Uh, things just got a little
carried away last night.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.067
Nothing more than catching up
with an old friend.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.778
Hm, seems like more than
catching up to me.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.154
You have a black eye!

04:40.238 --> 04:43.116
Couple of old mysterious men
having slumber parties?

04:43.116 --> 04:44.701
Shit's obvious, dude.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.994
What's obvious?

04:45.994 --> 04:47.954
You are fucking that man.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.664
Y'all are hanging out here
being rough with each other

04:49.664 --> 04:51.666
like grizzly bears
doing donkey punches.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.293
- Okay.
- Tussling each other.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.502
Getting each other hard.

04:54.502 --> 04:57.714
Judy, ugh!
Wash your mouth out with soap!

04:57.714 --> 04:59.382
Daddy, that man is not cute.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.051
Call me crazy, I always hoped
if you were gonna yank a pole,

05:02.135 --> 05:04.721
it be somebody hot,
like a Patrick Stewart type.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.556
Well, maybe next time
you'll think twice

05:06.556 --> 05:09.267
before barging
into my home unannounced.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.393
You know what, Daddy?

05:10.393 --> 05:12.103
I'm gonna go surprise somebody

05:12.103 --> 05:13.896
who gives a shit
about their daughter!

05:13.980 --> 05:14.939
- Okay.
- How 'bout that?

05:15.023 --> 05:17.191
Come on BJ,
and don't touch anything

05:17.275 --> 05:19.736
because it's probably covered
in secretions

05:19.736 --> 05:23.197
and there's probably Hep C loads
everywhere.

05:23.281 --> 05:24.866
- No, Judy, Judy.
- Uh.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.868
It wasn't supposed
to go like this.

All right.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.648
That business last night,

05:57.732 --> 05:59.275
I really needed that.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.568

I ain't trying
to be no crazy religious person

06:14.499 --> 06:17.502

- Junior, if you're serious,

06:17.502 --> 06:18.795
come to church.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.505
Big church like you got?

06:20.505 --> 06:22.340
Cost some money
to get in them doors.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.884
Brother, church is free.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.636
Unless you wanna sit
in the good seats.

06:26.636 --> 06:27.970
Well, I've been
in enough strip joints,

06:28.054 --> 06:30.223
I know what it takes
to get the good sniffer seat.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.808
Don't suppose

06:31.808 --> 06:33.601
you could reserve
those good seats

06:33.601 --> 06:36.646
for your old childhood friends,
could you?

06:36.646 --> 06:38.106
I'll see what I can do.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.982
Amen.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.776
Amen.

06:41.776 --> 06:44.695
We call ourselves
the Second Chance prayer group

06:44.779 --> 06:46.280
'cause that's what we got...

06:46.364 --> 06:47.615
second chances.
- Mm-hmm.

06:47.615 --> 06:48.908
Some of us anyway.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.493
I got divorced.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.120
Chad,
let's not sour the mood, okay?

06:52.120 --> 06:53.996
There's a lot of progress
to be proud of.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.125
When we started this group,
we were in crisis,

06:57.125 --> 07:00.294
our marriages in question.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.548
But I can say now that we are
all doing much better.

07:03.548 --> 07:04.549
Yes.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.801
Oh, except for Chad!

07:06.801 --> 07:09.345
Okay, who is this you brought
with you today, Mandy?

07:09.345 --> 07:10.972
Is this your father?

07:10.972 --> 07:12.014
No.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.683
It ain't my father.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.852
It's Waylon, my new man.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.645
Chad begged me to come,

07:17.645 --> 07:18.980
but he didn't say
I couldn't bring nobody.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.190
Well, even Chad is trying
to do better.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.483
You know,
the point of this group is

07:22.567 --> 07:24.819
to not treat each other
like assholes.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.530
The point is to rebuild
what has been broken,

07:27.530 --> 07:31.075
to reestablish relationships
with family,

07:31.159 --> 07:35.538
friends, colleagues, the Lord,
and ultimately...yourself.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.206
- Amen.
- But the real story

07:37.290 --> 07:40.501
is about the progress
that we have made.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.713
In fact, that is why we will not
be able to host this meeting

07:43.713 --> 07:44.714
on Saturday night.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.382
Uh-oh, cat's out of the bag.

07:46.382 --> 07:48.092
Hush, hush.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.595
Jesse and I are blessed
to be teaming up

07:50.595 --> 07:53.264
with Lyle and Lindy Lissons
on a new business venture.

07:55.391 --> 07:56.434
That's right.

07:56.434 --> 07:57.518
Behold!

07:58.603 --> 08:00.313
Zion's Landing.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.691
A luxury all-inclusive
time-share resort

08:03.691 --> 08:05.234

08:05.318 --> 08:07.361
Construction is due

08:07.445 --> 08:10.031
on the beautiful,
sunny coastline of Florida.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.325
And it is top-notch service.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.327
- Yes.
- I'm talking white gloves.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.870
- And guess what else we got.
- What?

08:15.870 --> 08:18.664
We got a special discount
for folks of this prayer group

08:18.748 --> 08:19.707
tonight!
- What?

08:19.707 --> 08:21.042
Okay.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.753
Early-bird special,
15% off--

08:23.753 --> 08:24.879

08:24.879 --> 08:26.589
- Oh, my.
- I'm looking at you, Levy.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.757
You and your mama back there.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.425
You sure have
put her through enough.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.637

get her some sunshine!

08:34.347 --> 08:36.098

Yes, yes!

08:38.226 --> 08:39.936
Yes!

08:39.936 --> 08:41.145
I'm glad we have this group

08:41.229 --> 08:42.688
to get to spend
some quality time together.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.065
- Yeah.
- You know, like we used to?

08:44.065 --> 08:46.734
And just when we made
the wives sign those NDAs.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.402
I thought we'd never get
a chance to hang out again.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.445
Oh, this is not hanging out!

08:49.445 --> 08:51.447
This is going
to couples' prayer group.

08:51.447 --> 08:53.866
It's not the same.
Nah, this ain't shit.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.826
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

08:56.827 --> 08:57.912
Hey, how's it going?

08:57.912 --> 08:59.747
Love you guys.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.749
Happy wife, happy life.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.417
Well, what rhymes
with divorced wife?

09:03.501 --> 09:05.127
I wouldn't know.
I never had one.

09:08.089 --> 09:11.425
Levy, what the hell's going on

18:07.169 --> 18:09.338
Then there's only one solution.

18:09.338 --> 18:10.506
We gotta ask your daddy for it.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.007
He ain't gonna give us
no money.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.384
He'll say no
just to teach me a lesson.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.428
Why don't you let me
talk to him?

18:16.512 --> 18:17.721
Baby, I never get involved.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.682
And he'll know it's important
if I speak to him.

18:20.766 --> 18:24.686
I really think I can get Eli
to listen to me on this one.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.355
Wear that dress
that pushes them titties up,

18:26.355 --> 18:27.314
the green one.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.440
Yes, sir.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.776
We are in control
of our own destiny.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.194
My silver bullet.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.946
- Okay.
- And I fucking love you.

18:33.946 --> 18:37.825
I love you.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.496

- A little more to it than that.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.248
Man, I can't believe
you and Grandpa

20:08.332 --> 20:09.416
used to wrestle together.

20:09.416 --> 20:10.834
- Oh, yeah.
- I mean, that's crazy.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.295
Eli was known
as the Maniac Kid back then.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.923
He was the poorest son
of a bitch in our league.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.758
And look
at the motherfucker now.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.301
Been very fortunate.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.803
Work hard for the Lord
and the Lord will reward.

20:21.887 --> 20:22.846
- Yes.
- That's right, Daddy.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.306
Amen.
- Yes, he does.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.642
And I couldn't help but notice
that new Tesla Judy has.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.269
That was
a very generous gesture.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.771
Well, it was a wedding gift.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.273
As I recall, your mother
and I gave you and Amber both

20:33.357 --> 20:34.483
cars for yours.
- Y'all did.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.776
Why didn't I get a car?

20:35.776 --> 20:37.361
Okay, hang on just one second.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.612
Jesse, you like that Tesla?

20:38.612 --> 20:40.197
Take it, okay?

20:40.197 --> 20:41.490
It's too complicated anyway.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.783
It don't even take gas.
- No, no, no.

20:42.783 --> 20:43.825
It ain't about the gift.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.285
It's about the giving.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.621
Here Judy doesn't even invite
you to her wedding,

20:47.621 --> 20:50.832
and yet you find your way
to still give her a reward.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.793
Your generosity
and constant support,

20:52.793 --> 20:54.628
it never goes unnoticed, Daddy.

20:54.628 --> 20:57.923
You are always there
for your children.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.050
Always.
- Yuck.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.843
Okay.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.845
Thank you, Jesse.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.682
And Eli,
you know I never involve myself

21:06.682 --> 21:09.184
in matters pertaining
to business,

21:09.184 --> 21:11.186
but this time-share hotel
with the Lissons,

21:11.186 --> 21:12.354
it means so much.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.855
Well, you have my blessing.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.857
And I wish you luck.
- Thank you.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.985
We're gonna need a little bit
more than luck though,

21:17.985 --> 21:19.319
unfortunately.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.947
Because the initial investment
is $10 million.

21:21.947 --> 21:22.990
- Whoo!
- Okay.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.658
The bomb has been dropped.

21:24.658 --> 21:25.701
Ooh, whee!
Mama!

21:25.701 --> 21:27.494
Okay, I knew it.

21:27.494 --> 21:29.496
I'm sitting here going,
"I know something's weird,"

21:29.496 --> 21:30.497
and now I know it.

21:30.497 --> 21:32.332
That's why your whole jug
is out.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.376
I understand.
I thought this was happening.

21:34.376 --> 21:35.544
Y'all are running games.

21:35.544 --> 21:36.712
Her jugs are just out

21:36.712 --> 21:38.088
because this is what
they normally are doing.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.715
Yuck.
Yuck, Jesse.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.676
What y'all are doing right now
is gross.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.219
Building a new resort
ain't cheap.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.221
No, it is not cheap at all.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.307
Thank you, fucking Martin.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.809
But I have every faith
that we will get this money back

21:50.809 --> 21:52.436
and then some, Daddy.
- You told me

21:52.436 --> 21:54.062
y'all were doing this
on your own.

21:54.146 --> 21:57.024
Doing it on your own means
coming up with your own funding.

21:57.024 --> 21:59.735
When I started out, I barely had
two sticks to rub together.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.570
You have a lot more
than two sticks.

22:01.570 --> 22:02.946
I know I got more
than two sticks.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.614
You're the one saying
damn two sticks.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.658
Maybe getting involved
in such a big project

22:06.742 --> 22:08.493
isn't the best idea
for you right now.

22:08.577 --> 22:09.536
I was just thinking that,
Daddy.

22:09.536 --> 22:10.746
Asshole.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.623
He's right.
Yeah, nice work, Dr. Tits.

22:13.707 --> 22:17.085
Your little beg party
is a shit show.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.170
Ta-ta for now.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.838
Yeah.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.256
Don't you sweat it, Jesse.

22:21.256 --> 22:24.092
My daddy, he turned down
all my big moneymaking ideas.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.427
And look at me.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.137
I turned out a'ight.
- Ooh.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.347
Look at him, Jesse.

22:29.431 --> 22:32.184
Well, since we've already
broke our rule

22:32.184 --> 22:34.269
about talking business
at the table,

22:34.269 --> 22:36.688
there's something
y'all should be aware of.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.024
The reporter that took down
the Butterfields

22:39.024 --> 22:40.567
is in our backyard.

22:40.567 --> 22:43.195
Says he's doing some piece
on us.

22:43.195 --> 22:46.073
Probably just trying to stir
the pot, dig up some dirt.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.783
Daddy, you let me handle this.

22:47.783 --> 22:48.784
I'll put a crew together

22:48.784 --> 22:50.285
and I'll send him
a fucking message

22:50.285 --> 22:52.454
that he is sniffing
the wrong dog's asshole!

22:52.454 --> 22:53.914
There we go.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.582
What we're gonna do
is nothing.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.793
Operate like he doesn't exist.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.628
Anybody ask any questions,

22:59.628 --> 23:01.338
tell 'em to talk
to our legal team.

23:01.338 --> 23:03.465
I'm hearing this,
and I'm processing it,

23:03.465 --> 23:05.509
and I'm just thinking
the only way we put

23:05.509 --> 23:06.927
this to an end, Daddy,

23:06.927 --> 23:08.678
is if I go seduce this man.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.639
You know,
get some intel through turn-ons,

23:10.639 --> 23:11.973
hand-holds, eye contacts.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.392
Jack him off just a little bit.

23:14.476 --> 23:18.605
No, what we're gonna do
is zip our lips, like I said.

23:18.605 --> 23:20.440
Well, I'm just gonna go
on record saying I think

23:20.524 --> 23:23.443
it'd be better if Judy at least
jacked this fella off

23:23.527 --> 23:24.486
than do nothing at all.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.154
Daddy,
I could just get him hungry.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.323
This is another
super bad choice

23:28.323 --> 23:30.408
made by the current
church leader.

Everybody, just leave it alone.

That's why we'd like
to come here and participate

Man, I'm just looking

27:02.871 --> 27:04.873

27:09.294 --> 27:10.253
Totally.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.547
Uh, no, it doesn't.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.049
This is not what we talked
about.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.050
Breaking and entering?

27:15.050 --> 27:16.176
Absolutely not.

27:16.176 --> 27:17.719
Needle nuts,
the door is wide open.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.220
This ain't breaking,
this is just entering.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.347
