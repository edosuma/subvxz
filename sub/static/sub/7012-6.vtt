00:05.100 --> 00:08.060
- Good morning. I have terrible news.
- Are we out of bacon?

00:08.140 --> 00:11.780
- No. I was outside, and...
- Remember that time we were out of bacon?

00:11.820 --> 00:15.580
Do I?
Nearly tore this family apart.

00:17.020 --> 00:19.380
Listen to me!

00:19.460 --> 00:21.380
Midge left Bob.

00:23.340 --> 00:27.460
Are you sure? I mean, maybe
she's just lost in the backyard.

00:29.540 --> 00:34.220
This is serious. I was up early, and I saw
Midge getting into her car with a suitcase.

00:34.260 --> 00:37.980
And I said, "Where are you going, Midge?"
Because I'm concerned, not nosy.

00:38.060 --> 00:41.860
And she said to me, "I am leaving
Bob, and I am never coming back."

00:41.940 --> 00:45.100
And I said, "Okay."

00:45.180 --> 00:49.700
And then I... I... I laughed like I do
when I'm uncomfortable.

00:58.220 --> 01:00.700
But... what about Donna?

01:00.780 --> 01:03.060
I mean, what are they gonna do?

01:03.140 --> 01:06.140
Well, okay.
They are going to depend...

01:06.220 --> 01:08.940
on the kindness of their friends
and neighbors...

01:09.020 --> 01:12.020
which is why we need to go over there
as a family to comfort them.

01:12.100 --> 01:14.980
- Yikes. No.
- I don't think so.

01:15.060 --> 01:17.820
- Why not?
- Well, it just seems like it'd be...

01:17.900 --> 01:20.300
like there'd be an awful lot of...

01:20.380 --> 01:22.300
- Crying.
- Yeah.

01:22.380 --> 01:25.420
- So, no.
- Yeah, no.

01:27.820 --> 01:30.020
Well, fine.

01:30.060 --> 01:32.700
Then I will go myself.

01:32.780 --> 01:35.340
Hey! Where are you
going with my food?

01:36.620 --> 01:38.500
To Bob and Donna.

01:38.580 --> 01:42.260
When your wife or mother leaves you,
you need a good breakfast.

01:42.340 --> 01:44.900
I need a good breakfast.

01:44.980 --> 01:47.540
I didn't leave you.
Eat a Pop-Tart.

01:52.980 --> 01:56.060
When I woke up, her bag
was packed and she left.

01:56.140 --> 01:58.820
Didn't even say where she was going.

01:58.900 --> 02:00.820
On the other hand...

02:00.900 --> 02:05.940
we have pancakes with egg eyes
and bacon smiley faces!

02:09.740 --> 02:12.620
The hash-brown hair is nice.

02:12.700 --> 02:16.180
I can't believe she would just take off
without even a hint or a warning.

02:16.260 --> 02:18.420
No warning?

02:18.500 --> 02:22.660
Dad, she was always saying,
"I'm unhappy, and I'm gonna leave."

02:22.700 --> 02:26.340
Honey, that's just
what married people say.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.300
Did she say where she was going?

02:31.340 --> 02:36.900
Well, she said she was
going to California to...

02:36.980 --> 02:39.780
to be a star on Broadway.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.620
So...

02:43.660 --> 02:45.700
Oh, Midgie.

02:45.740 --> 02:48.420
She may not have been smart...

02:48.500 --> 02:50.700
but she sure was sweet.

02:50.780 --> 02:52.700
And built too, boy.

02:53.740 --> 02:55.620
Okay.

02:55.700 --> 02:58.060
Thanks, Mrs. Forman,
but I'm really not hungry.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.220
Oh, what a nightmare.

03:09.100 --> 03:11.300
She was unhappy, Bob.

03:11.340 --> 03:14.180
No, she took the Eldorado.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.840
So Midge just took off?

03:53.920 --> 03:56.280
Ah, poor Donna.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.520
Yeah, this is really bad.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.560
Yeah, not only did Donna
lose her mom...

04:01.600 --> 04:04.480
we all lost Midge's sweet, uptown rack.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.840
Oh, good God, man,
what a marvelous set of kittens.

04:18.079 --> 04:20.519
- Remember that sweater?
- Oh.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.800
Remember the other sweater?

04:24.880 --> 04:29.280
Yeah. Remember that time
she ran up to us in a sweater?

04:30.880 --> 04:33.240
Remember the week
she took up jump rope?

04:36.240 --> 04:38.480
In a sweater?

05:02.800 --> 05:04.720
Eric!

05:06.560 --> 05:08.480
What are you boys
thinking about so hard?

05:08.560 --> 05:10.000
- Nothing.
- Homework.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.520
- Jesus.
- Kittens.

05:14.160 --> 05:17.600
Okay, um, Eric, I need you
to take a casserole to the Pinciottis.

05:17.680 --> 05:22.600
So run upstairs and put on
a nice, clean shirt and a sport coat.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.800
What?
No, I'm not going over there.

05:25.880 --> 05:29.360
Donna and I broke up,
and things are weird with us.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.480
Well, that's too bad.

05:31.560 --> 05:35.120
Because I went over there,
and Bob's a crier...

05:35.200 --> 05:37.280
and a hugger.

05:37.360 --> 05:40.720
And when you get caught
in a crying-Bob hug, there is no escape.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.240
And I cannot go back over there!

05:49.640 --> 05:52.920
I don't know.
I like to be hugged by Bob.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.880
He makes me feel safe.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.480
Okay, okay, there he is.
Go talk to him.

06:04.560 --> 06:08.400
No, Kitty.
It's a personal matter, and I... Oh!

06:11.360 --> 06:13.280
That's mature.

06:14.320 --> 06:17.440
Oh, hey there, Red!

06:17.520 --> 06:19.440
Hi, Bob.

06:19.520 --> 06:22.680
What a day, huh?
What a day to be alive.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.640
I feel great.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.440
You do?

06:27.520 --> 06:29.400
Well, then...

06:29.480 --> 06:31.640
I can go back inside.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.640
Bye.

06:36.320 --> 06:39.240
Yup, Midgie's been on me
for weeks to weed the garden.

06:42.920 --> 06:47.680
I'm finally gettin' around to it, so when she
comes back, she's gonna see that I did it.

06:47.720 --> 06:49.880
You think she's coming back?

06:49.920 --> 06:52.680
Well, why shouldn't she?
I did all the right things.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.720
We had an open marriage,
experimented with drugs.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.480
I even threw nudist parties.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.840
Yeah, what more could a husband do?

07:08.440 --> 07:11.160
All right. Let's not get
bummed out, guys, okay?

07:11.200 --> 07:15.480
There are a lot of other hot older women
out there besides Midge.

07:15.520 --> 07:20.360
And they deserve our respect,
'cause they can teach us stuff.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.480
Yes, I would love to make love
to an 80-year-old.

07:28.840 --> 07:31.560
They must know everything.

07:31.640 --> 07:35.160
And not just about sex,
but history and trivia too.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.680
Yeah.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.600
The young ones are too timid,
but the older ones...

07:41.680 --> 07:43.880
They know it won't break.

07:46.040 --> 07:49.200
How could it break?
It is invincible.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.920
Yeah, and plus,
they're, like, grateful...

07:54.000 --> 07:56.640
you know, so they'll do it with,
like, almost anybody.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.600
Anybody?

08:00.680 --> 08:02.600
Well, that's me!

08:05.760 --> 08:09.640
Let's find Fez
a dirty housewife to love.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.760
Yeah, man, I'm in.
Hyde?

08:12.800 --> 08:15.920
I don't know, guys.
I was gonna go watch <i>Donahue.</i>

08:16.000 --> 08:18.360
What do you think the chances are
of Fez gettin' burned?

08:18.440 --> 08:21.400
- Pretty good.
- Damn good.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.080
Then I am in.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.400
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:34.039 --> 08:36.640
So...

08:36.720 --> 08:39.200
hey, look, I'm really
sorry about your mom.

08:40.240 --> 08:44.560
<i>And, uh, I mean, are you okay?</i>

08:44.640 --> 08:47.440
I don't know.
It's weird.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.360
Yeah, well, you know,
it won't make you feel any better...

08:51.440 --> 08:55.920
but for some reason
I brought you a casserole.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.080
I mean, why is it that...

08:59.160 --> 09:01.960
every time something bad happens,
grown-ups always think you need food?

09:02.040 --> 09:05.920
You lost your job?
Congratulations, you get a bucket of chicken!

09:06.000 --> 09:08.240
I mean, the last thing you want is to...

09:13.360 --> 09:16.200
Are these crushed potato chips?

09:16.280 --> 09:18.840
Look...

09:18.880 --> 09:21.240
Donna, look.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.440
I know we broke up...

09:24.520 --> 09:28.080
but I still, you know...

09:28.160 --> 09:30.040
I still care about you.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.960
Okay. Okay.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.920
So...

09:47.680 --> 09:50.440
Eric, in the bedroom.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.120
Oh, yeah, I knew that.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.560
I'll just...
I'm gonna...

10:04.760 --> 10:08.160
Is that a tennis getup?

10:08.240 --> 10:10.880
Yup.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.880
Yeah, I'm out.

10:15.560 --> 10:19.960
What's his problem? This is the perfect
outfit for picking up older ladies.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.040
Uh-huh.
How's that?

10:24.320 --> 10:28.080
Well, everyone knows that horny older ladies
hang out at tennis clubs.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.000
Yeah, well, see, Fez...

10:32.080 --> 10:35.320
Point Place doesn't have a tennis club,
or even a tennis court.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.560
We do have that concrete wall
behind the gym...

10:37.640 --> 10:41.000
but people mostly use that just for
smoking weed and beating up freshmen.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.920
And foreign exchange students.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.520
You were new, okay?

10:51.400 --> 10:55.000
No. You know where we gotta go
to get the ladies is the grocery store.

10:55.040 --> 10:59.440
Oh, the Piggly Wiggly?
I love the Piggly Wiggly.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.320
They have candy.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.320
Yeah.
And older ladies.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.280
And candy.

11:08.360 --> 11:11.520
Yeah, but the important thing
is the older ladies!

11:11.600 --> 11:13.920
And candy.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.640
All right, Fez. What do you want,
the older ladies or the candy?

11:16.720 --> 11:18.920
Fine, you win.
The older ladies.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.320
- Thank you.
- And candy.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.000
It was the sport coat, right?

11:34.200 --> 11:36.720
- Again?
- Yes, please.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.200
So, you don't want to cuddle?

11:42.720 --> 11:45.400
That's cool.

11:49.320 --> 11:51.640
Bob thinks Midge is coming back?

11:51.720 --> 11:55.480
That is the saddest thing I ever heard.

11:55.560 --> 12:00.080
Oh, come on, Kitty.
Let him think it. Who does it hurt?

12:00.120 --> 12:02.520
It hurts Bob.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.480
Well, who else does it hurt?

12:06.480 --> 12:08.720
Steven.

12:10.040 --> 12:13.720
Red, Bob has to grieve
so the healing can begin.

12:13.800 --> 12:18.400
But, Kitty, then he'll grieve all over me.

12:18.480 --> 12:23.320
Hey, remember that time Bob ate a bad taco
and grieved all inside your car?

12:24.640 --> 12:27.920
Thank you.
Case closed.

12:29.720 --> 12:32.600
Why would you bring that up?

12:33.680 --> 12:35.720
Well, sorry, Mrs. Forman.

12:35.800 --> 12:39.960
It's just that it was gross,
so I think about it a lot.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.760
Hi, kids. Good to see you.
Good to see you.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.480
Someone is looking lovely today, Mom.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.600
What's with you, man?

12:51.640 --> 12:54.360
I guess a little thing like
getting back together with your old gal...

12:54.440 --> 12:56.360
puts a spring in a man's step.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.280
You and Donna
are back together?

12:59.360 --> 13:02.280
That is wonderful!

13:02.360 --> 13:04.400
So, did you talk things through?

13:04.480 --> 13:06.400
No.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.960
Then how do you know
you're back together?

13:16.360 --> 13:18.280
Yeah, we talked things through.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.920
Talked or grunted?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.040
Stifle.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.280
Okay, well, good.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.240
I'm gonna need details.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.560
Oh, there will be details aplenty...

13:30.640 --> 13:32.960
in my steamy letter to <i>Penthouse.</i>

13:34.800 --> 13:36.680
Okay, my mom's still behind me,
isn't she?

13:44.360 --> 13:46.280
So, you guys did it?

13:46.360 --> 13:47.480
Twice.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.800
Five times!

13:51.600 --> 13:52.720
Nice.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.960
Yech!

13:55.040 --> 13:56.960
And you're back together?

13:57.040 --> 13:58.320
Oh, yeah.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.280
God, no.

14:00.320 --> 14:03.600
It was like... magic.

14:03.640 --> 14:07.040
Oh, I feel sick.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.160
Yup, we're back together.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.120
And, Hyde, more than this, much...

14:13.200 --> 14:15.920
more than this...

14:20.520 --> 14:22.440
I'm sure he's forgotten all about it.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.080
Man, back when
I was cheating on Jackie...

14:41.160 --> 14:44.040
I used to meet a ton
of older ladies here.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.320
Hello, Michael.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.920
Hey, Joyce.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.320
That's Coach Ferguson's wife!

14:54.400 --> 14:58.040
Yeah.
She's lonely, and she drinks.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.720
Oh, you're a Piggly Wiggly god.

15:01.760 --> 15:03.600
Yeah.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.640
Ooh la la!

15:09.880 --> 15:12.600
Oh, me like.

15:12.680 --> 15:14.920
Well, make your move, man.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.600
Ay, no.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.280
After I painted
Midge's bathroom pink...

15:35.320 --> 15:39.280
sprinkled a little lavender water
in her toilet like she likes...

15:39.320 --> 15:41.240
I went out and got these chocolates.

15:41.320 --> 15:45.520
I hope she likes 'em. I guess we'll find out
when she comes back, huh?

15:45.560 --> 15:47.880
Bob, she... I...

15:49.280 --> 15:54.640
Aw, Bob, you poor,
dumb son of a bitch.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.720
That's mean.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.840
Bob, she's not comin' back.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.480
- Yes, she is.
- No, she's not.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.720
- Yes, she is.
- No, she's not.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.720
- Yes, she is.
- No, she's not!

16:07.800 --> 16:09.840
- Yes, she is!
- Fine!

16:09.880 --> 16:13.360
These chocolates are for Midge, Bob?
They're for Midge? Fine!

16:13.440 --> 16:15.360
Let's give 'em to Midge!

16:15.440 --> 16:17.320
Here you go, Midge!

16:17.400 --> 16:19.600
You're throwing away
Midgie's chocolates.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.720
And why would I do that, Bob?

16:21.800 --> 16:24.200
'Cause you're mean!

16:25.240 --> 16:27.080
And why else?

16:30.360 --> 16:32.240
She's not coming back, is she?

16:37.320 --> 16:39.240
I knew that.

16:41.560 --> 16:44.080
Listen, you wanna go get a beer?

16:46.240 --> 16:49.240
Yeah. Yeah.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.960
You're a good friend.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.960
I might cry.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.920
And I might hit you.

17:01.720 --> 17:07.400
Michael, how could you bring poor,
sweet Fez to the Piggly Wiggly?

17:07.480 --> 17:10.560
There are a lot of
footloose women in that store.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.520
Do you know Joyce Ferguson?

17:12.599 --> 17:14.760
Who? No!
That's a lie!

17:15.720 --> 17:17.640
- What?
- What?

17:17.720 --> 17:18.800
- What?
- What?

17:23.440 --> 17:27.920
And you! Grabbing strange rear ends
is no way to meet a nice girl.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.000
It's rude, ungentlemanly behavior...

17:32.080 --> 17:35.560
that will not be appreciated
by a woman of class.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.760
And thank you for the compliment.
It made my day.

17:50.680 --> 17:53.360
You know what I just noticed?
Mrs. Forman is hot.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.960
Yeah, she's a cutie.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.920
And firm.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.840
You know, maybe we should
get her a sweater for Christmas.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.840
She actually doesn't want
to be with you at all.

18:12.920 --> 18:16.160
Isn't that hilarious?

18:16.240 --> 18:18.200
Yeah, he thinks
you're back together.

18:18.280 --> 18:20.600
It's really sad.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.600
Hold on. What?

18:22.680 --> 18:26.520
Look, she said she would've
done it with anybody.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.560
No, no.
Donna wouldn't say that.

18:29.640 --> 18:34.320
I mean, it was like I would
have done it with anybody.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.880
Anybody?

18:36.960 --> 18:41.960
Damn, and I was just over there
watching stupid <i>Donahue.</i>

18:42.040 --> 18:44.440
Hey, let's do it right now.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.440
Eric's gonna be so mad.

18:46.520 --> 18:49.400
- Are you mad?
- So mad.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.880
Yeah, I'm just kidding
about the "do it" stuff.

18:51.960 --> 18:55.040
- I'm sorry about your mom.
- Thanks.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.000
You know what?

18:57.080 --> 18:59.120
That's it.
She can't use me like this.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.440
I'm goin' over there
to yell at her right now!

19:01.520 --> 19:03.960
With yelling!

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Seriously, let's do it right now.

19:14.640 --> 19:18.120
Okay, listen. You need to tell me
what the hell you think you're doing!

19:18.200 --> 19:20.800
What am I doing?
Well, my mom left us...

19:20.880 --> 19:23.720
so I'm boxing up her clothes,
because I can't look at them anymore.

19:23.800 --> 19:27.880
I'm sorry for needing you, but I did. So if
you have something to say to me, just say it.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.000
Okay, thank you!

19:30.040 --> 19:32.600
I did have something to say,
and it was good!

19:32.680 --> 19:36.320
But that was before you said your mom stuff
and your sad clothes stuff...

19:36.400 --> 19:39.360
and now my s-sex stuff...

19:40.560 --> 19:42.800
sounds...

19:42.880 --> 19:44.800
sucky.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.640
Look, I'm sorry if you thought that we...

19:50.680 --> 19:52.600
No. No, I'm sorry.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.320
Let's just... What...
What, do you need some help or something?

19:59.360 --> 20:01.560
Yeah, thanks.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.320
Oh, my God.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.960
Oh, my God.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.960
This is mine.

20:21.040 --> 20:25.200
Midge borrowed it, and
she never gave it back.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.920
I bet my bra's here too.

20:41.780 --> 20:43.860
I miss my li'l Midgers.

20:46.020 --> 20:49.620
Bob, you know the rules.
You cry, you buy.

20:51.580 --> 20:53.460
Three pitchers, please.

20:59.900 --> 21:01.780
Hi.
