<i>ADRIAN: Previously on The Secret
Life of the American Teenager...</i>

00:03.477 --> 00:04.711
It's summer school. It
doesn't really count, does it?

00:04.746 --> 00:06.447
As a matter of fact, it does.

00:06.481 --> 00:08.348
Is Amy home? Who's asking?

00:08.383 --> 00:09.550
We're Amy's friends from New York.

00:09.584 --> 00:11.251
You really need Henry, you know that?

00:11.286 --> 00:12.653
How is it that Henry sleeps with Adrian

00:12.687 --> 00:14.321
and you end up not
being friends with me?

00:14.355 --> 00:15.722
Lauren just spoke to me!

00:15.757 --> 00:18.625
If you make up with Lauren, I'm
going to be lost. I have no one.

00:18.660 --> 00:20.594
I don't wanna watch someone else's kids.

00:20.596 --> 00:22.463
Now I wish I hadn't told
Grace we were going out.

00:22.497 --> 00:23.530
Then she neveranna watch
would have known.'s kids.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.265
I still wanna be your girlfriend.

00:25.300 --> 00:26.567
If you can be my friend

00:26.601 --> 00:28.335
then maybe Ben could
be our friend again.

00:28.369 --> 00:30.637
Dylan is smart enough
to keep her friends close

00:30.672 --> 00:32.305
and her enemies closer.

00:32.340 --> 00:34.541
That's why you still
need Alice and Henry.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.643
I don't wanna have sex with you
without some kind of commitment.

00:36.678 --> 00:39.613
You don't seriously think I can make
a commitment to you for life right now?

00:39.647 --> 00:40.747
Will you marry me?

00:41.716 --> 00:43.250
I love you, Adrian.

00:43.284 --> 00:45.285
Take as long as you want to answer.

00:45.320 --> 00:47.254
I know about the girls.

00:47.288 --> 00:50.324
You are too smart to get
yourself into trouble with Ethan.

00:50.358 --> 00:52.359
You don't think I should
be friends with Ben?

00:52.393 --> 00:54.528
Tell Ricky you talked to Ben at
the pizza joint and then drop it.

00:54.562 --> 00:56.363
You and Ben don't need to be friends.

00:56.397 --> 00:57.464
You don't need to be enemies,

00:57.499 --> 00:59.466
but you don't need to be friends.

01:04.706 --> 01:06.640
Let's go find Daddy.

01:06.674 --> 01:08.575
Hey you two, dinner's ready.

01:08.610 --> 01:13.213
Mmm. Something smells
good, I'm starving.

01:13.248 --> 01:16.316
Oh, it's just pasta, with
a tomato sauce, no meat.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.687
Really? Pasta?

01:20.722 --> 01:22.656
Come on, sit down. One of the customers

01:22.690 --> 01:24.391
brought in some
tomatoes from her garden,

01:24.425 --> 01:27.494
so I tried making a marinara sauce.

01:31.366 --> 01:33.367
I'm usually the one
who makes the spaghetti.

01:33.401 --> 01:35.269
Yeah, but rather than
make it with fake meat,

01:35.303 --> 01:37.404
I decided to make it
with no meat at all.

01:37.438 --> 01:39.373
I think it's pretty
good. And I made a salad.

01:39.407 --> 01:41.275
She gave me some lettuce
right out of her garden.

01:41.309 --> 01:43.610
It actually tastes like something,
not like the grocery stuff.

01:44.746 --> 01:46.547
Yeah, the salad looks good,

01:46.581 --> 01:49.449
but, um, spaghetti is like the
only thing I know how to cook.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.652
Like I always say, if you
can read, you can cook,

01:51.686 --> 01:54.421
but you don't have time to
cook, it's just not your thing.

01:54.455 --> 01:55.522
It's okay, let's eat.

01:55.557 --> 01:57.524
It's my thing, sometimes.

01:57.559 --> 02:00.460
I just told you this morning
that I'd cook tomorrow night.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.429
Yeah, but you don't have to.

02:02.463 --> 02:04.431
But I want to.

02:04.465 --> 02:07.501
I'm feeling really guilty about you
taking care of my friends last week

02:07.535 --> 02:09.235
and I wanted to do
something nice for you.

02:09.270 --> 02:10.670
This isn't going to taste
anything like your spaghetti,

02:10.705 --> 02:13.340
so you can still make your
spaghetti tomorrow night if you want.

02:13.374 --> 02:15.409
We can't have spaghetti
two nights in a row.

02:15.443 --> 02:16.643
We can if you want.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.580
There's no law against
it. Come on, let's eat.

02:19.614 --> 02:21.381
You know that night when
I went out to get pizza

02:21.416 --> 02:23.250
and it took like an hour
longer than it should have?

02:23.284 --> 02:24.384
I guess.

02:24.419 --> 02:26.520
I was talking to Ben.

02:26.554 --> 02:29.556
I saw him at the pizza place
and we sat down and talked.

02:30.558 --> 02:32.626
I just wanted you to know.

02:32.660 --> 02:35.596
I guess you just wanted me
to know a couple weeks later,

02:35.630 --> 02:37.598
but I don't really care.

02:37.632 --> 02:39.266
You don't care?

02:39.300 --> 02:40.667
Should I? Shouldn't you?

02:40.702 --> 02:43.537
Why? It's Ben. You see him
at school every day anyway.

02:43.571 --> 02:45.405
You don't even want to know
what we were talking about?

02:45.440 --> 02:47.474
You can have a conversation with Ben

02:47.508 --> 02:49.476
without telling me everything
you were talking about.

02:50.612 --> 02:54.381
So, it was okay for me to
talk to Ben for an hour,

02:54.415 --> 02:56.416
a whole hour while you
were waiting for the pizza?

02:56.451 --> 02:58.518
I still got pizza.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.487
Don't forget, I was
once married to the guy.

03:00.521 --> 03:02.289
Don't forget, you weren't
really married to him.

03:02.323 --> 03:03.590
And a lot of time has passed since then

03:03.625 --> 03:05.292
and why are we talking about this?

03:05.326 --> 03:06.560
Because I thought it might be a problem,

03:06.594 --> 03:08.562
that Ben and I have
normalized our relationship.

03:08.596 --> 03:10.397
As friends.

03:10.431 --> 03:12.366
Unless normalizing your relationship
means you had sex with him,

03:12.400 --> 03:14.334
I really don't care.

03:14.369 --> 03:16.436
So, you're not even a
little bit upset with me?

03:16.471 --> 03:17.704
Not unless you want me to be.

03:19.540 --> 03:20.707
(SIGHING)

03:24.345 --> 03:26.213
(SIGHS)

03:26.247 --> 03:27.681
How was your day?

03:27.715 --> 03:29.583
Good. Mine, too.

03:35.690 --> 03:37.424
I'm sorry.

03:38.626 --> 03:41.428
I've just been so
stressed out about this

03:41.462 --> 03:42.696
and I couldn't find a way to tell you

03:42.730 --> 03:44.631
so I just blurted it out

03:44.666 --> 03:47.567
and I'm sure I took
you by surprise. So...

03:47.602 --> 03:49.536
So, how do you like the sauce?

03:50.438 --> 03:51.638
It's fine.

03:53.508 --> 03:57.244
Hey, it's okay to be
angry with me or to snap.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.313
You don't have to keep your
anger buried inside of you,

03:59.347 --> 04:02.482
you don't have to stuff it down.

04:02.517 --> 04:05.686
With some new sauce you made from
some woman who gave you tomatoes.

04:07.588 --> 04:09.323
By the way, I would like to know

04:09.357 --> 04:12.526
what woman is bringing
tomatoes into the shop for you.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.562
Because unlike you, I am bothered
when you flirt with some woman,

04:15.596 --> 04:17.497
any woman, because I care about you.

04:17.531 --> 04:19.433
Does she know you're
engaged to be married?

04:19.466 --> 04:21.668
No. I'm not wearing an engagement ring.

04:21.702 --> 04:24.237
And you never mentioned it? Nope.

04:24.605 --> 04:26.373
She's 79.

04:26.407 --> 04:27.474
Oh.

04:27.508 --> 04:28.542
So you were flirting with Ben?

04:28.576 --> 04:30.544
No, I didn't say that.

04:30.578 --> 04:33.547
Well, you drew a comparison between what
you were doing and what I was doing so...

04:33.581 --> 04:34.681
What's going on?

04:34.716 --> 04:36.583
Other than you're trying
to pick a fight with me.

04:36.617 --> 04:38.385
And by the way, even if
you pick a fight with me,

04:38.419 --> 04:39.519
I'm not going to ask for the ring back.

04:39.554 --> 04:40.620
So if you don't want to get married,

04:40.655 --> 04:41.688
you're going to have to say so.

04:41.723 --> 04:43.323
Just say so soon, all right?

04:43.358 --> 04:45.359
Hey, I want to get married, okay?

04:45.393 --> 04:47.294
I said yes, didn't I?

04:47.328 --> 04:48.495
Geez.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.531
I'll just pick a date.

04:53.634 --> 04:56.303
July the fourth of
next summer. How's that?

04:57.305 --> 04:59.506
That's great. God bless America.

04:59.540 --> 05:00.574
What does that mean?

05:00.608 --> 05:02.576
Nothing. Really. I just said it.

05:02.610 --> 05:05.512
Well it means something,
"God bless America."

05:05.546 --> 05:08.248
No, it doesn't. You just surprised
me with the fourth of July.

05:08.282 --> 05:09.616
What'd you want me to say?

05:09.650 --> 05:11.284
Let freedom ring?

05:11.319 --> 05:13.220
All right, that
definitely means something.

05:13.254 --> 05:14.488
It means, I'd like to
feel you set the date

05:14.522 --> 05:16.356
because you want to get married

05:16.391 --> 05:18.692
and not because you're upset that
I'm not upset that you talked to Ben.

05:25.433 --> 05:27.534
I doubt that tomato lady is 79.

Interesting choice.

(SLOWLY) Why the fourth of July?

Why not now?

Yeah. (SLOWLY) Why not now?

Oh, she probably wants a big wedding.

He's just giving me a

He's going to have spaghetti saucee meat

06:22.704 --> 06:24.838
and he claims but she doubts it.

06:25.941 --> 06:27.041
Oh, no, that's probably true.

06:27.075 --> 06:28.809
Mrs. Garrity has a huge garden,

06:28.843 --> 06:31.111
she always brings stuff in or she did.

06:31.146 --> 06:34.682
She's 79. The lady is 79.

06:34.716 --> 06:36.050
Who are you texting?

Uh... Mrs. Garrity, the woman who is 79.

06:39.020 --> 06:40.054
No, you're not.

06:40.088 --> 06:42.056
I could be. Who are you texting?

06:42.090 --> 06:45.092
My dad. Who is mom again, isn't he?your

06:45.126 --> 06:46.994
Yeah. So stop doing that to yourself.

06:59.975 --> 07:01.742
What is that?

07:01.776 --> 07:02.943
I thought I'd make it a theme night

07:02.978 --> 07:05.612
since we're getting
married the fourth of July.

07:05.647 --> 07:08.682
You went out after dinner
July underwear?th of

07:08.717 --> 07:09.883
No, I've been home all night.

07:09.918 --> 07:11.819
Uh-huh. And so where did you get those?

07:11.853 --> 07:12.920
I had them.

07:12.954 --> 07:14.621
Yeah. Where'd you get them?

07:14.656 --> 07:15.856
I don't know.

07:15.890 --> 07:17.825
You would never go buy
yourself flag underwear.

07:20.061 --> 07:22.629
Who are you texting? No one.

07:22.664 --> 07:24.698
Well? My mom gave them to me.

07:24.733 --> 07:26.633
You're sure the Tomato Lady?

07:26.668 --> 07:27.868
It was supposed to be a joke.

07:27.902 --> 07:29.003
You know why it's not funny?

07:29.037 --> 07:30.938
Because your mother didn't
give you that underwear.

07:30.972 --> 07:34.775
Just finish your homework
about my underwear.

07:34.809 --> 07:37.878
And why don't you and
stop texting people.

07:37.912 --> 07:39.813

Why would she pick the fourth of July?

So the whole country
can celebrate with them?

07:55.096 --> 07:59.933
I can't take of July wedding plans.th

07:59.968 --> 08:03.670
Maybe you could sleep with Ricky.

08:03.705 --> 08:06.707
What, we're not your sleeping around?

08:06.741 --> 08:08.609
What's the joke, that I'm a slut?

08:08.643 --> 08:10.044
You're not a...

08:10.078 --> 08:11.812
I don't like that word

08:11.846 --> 08:13.614
and I don't think girls
should call other girls

08:13.648 --> 08:15.849
sluts or skanks or any of that.

08:15.884 --> 08:18.052
You know what, you
just need to get laid.

08:18.086 --> 08:19.920
Uh, no, I don't.

08:19.954 --> 08:22.089
Uh... No, you do,

08:22.123 --> 08:23.891
if you did, you'd understand

08:23.925 --> 08:26.960
that sleeping at too early an ageon

08:26.995 --> 08:29.830
is seriously damaging
to your self-esteem.

08:29.864 --> 08:33.067
Okay, I'm going to say
that you should have said,

08:33.101 --> 08:35.803
"No thanks." Well, it's not that easy.

No. It is.

I'm still angry with you.

Okay, well, if the two of
us are going to be friends

08:48.883 --> 08:50.984
we can't be angry with each other.

08:51.019 --> 08:54.721
We need someone else to be
angry with, like a common enemy.

Like who? Amy?

08:56.691 --> 08:58.659
Amy? Think about it.

08:58.693 --> 08:59.960
Our entire high school experience

08:59.994 --> 09:01.862
has been centered around Amy Juergens

09:01.896 --> 09:04.631
and her having sex
one night at band camp.

09:04.666 --> 09:06.200
It started our freshman year

09:06.234 --> 09:10.070
and it's going to continue through
our senior year with her wedding plans.

09:10.105 --> 09:12.840
It's all about her. It's never about us.

09:12.874 --> 09:17.744
We need a life of our own that has
nothing to do with Amy and Ricky.

09:17.779 --> 09:21.682
Not that we can't be friends
with her, she is our friend but...

09:21.716 --> 09:23.083
But we're the girls
who didn't get pregnant

09:23.118 --> 09:24.885
and life should be about us, too.

09:24.919 --> 09:27.888
Right. And life shouldbg
other than just sex.

09:27.922 --> 09:29.056
Yeah.

09:29.090 --> 09:31.725
Like going to college
and picking a career

09:31.759 --> 09:34.027
and traveling the world and
experiencing other cultures...

09:34.062 --> 09:36.964
Bettering the world,
improving the environment,

09:36.998 --> 09:39.700
making a contribution
that uplifts mankind.

09:39.734 --> 09:41.635
But not in a sexual way.

09:44.005 --> 09:45.672
Great.

09:45.707 --> 09:47.040
Now that Lauren and
Madison are speaking again,

09:47.075 --> 09:48.976
they're too busy for me.

09:49.010 --> 09:50.844
And you're too busy for me.

10:01.923 --> 10:03.824
Ooh, I have to tell Henry.

10:03.858 --> 10:06.093
But I thought we just agreed
that we were going to have lives

10:06.127 --> 10:09.663
outside of Amy and Ricky so
why don't we not tell anyone?

10:09.697 --> 10:12.032
Because I just did.

10:12.066 --> 10:14.902
And besides, Henry is lonely.

10:14.936 --> 10:16.737
And I feel guilty

10:16.771 --> 10:19.139
because I haven't seen him since
you and I started talking again.

10:21.743 --> 10:23.810
Oh, great. The fourth of July.

10:23.845 --> 10:25.913
Amy and Ricky are getting
married the fourth of July.

Amy set a date. The

We were just kissing.

Don't they hand out
condoms at your high school?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.033
Yeah, I guess they do.

11:53.067 --> 11:54.801
Do they teach you to use them?

11:54.836 --> 11:58.005
Like in life sciences,
biology, one of those classes?

11:58.039 --> 12:00.774
They used to, but... Budget cuts.

or not, and get married.

Why do you care? Yeah.

12:31.839 --> 12:34.007
It's not that I still care about her,

Kathleen? She's not divorced.

No. They had a prenup. Neither
one wants to be married.

13:55.598 --> 13:57.766
They've filed. She's just
waiting. It's as clean as it gets.

George, it's not a good idea.

never going back to her.

a chance that when you see her again,

14:08.745 --> 14:10.412
you might change your mind.

14:10.447 --> 14:11.513
No chance at all. Anne is gay.

you hear it from anyone else.

Oh. Nice of Henry to let you know.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.581
Excellent.

15:52.615 --> 15:54.816
So, is there anything else?

15:56.719 --> 15:58.387
Not really.

15:58.421 --> 16:00.589
You know, I don't even know how to text.

16:00.623 --> 16:03.659
And you think now would be a good time
to learn while I'm entertaining guests?

16:03.693 --> 16:06.695
Well, I thought I'd at least
let Camille and Betty know.

16:06.729 --> 16:08.330
So call them.

16:08.364 --> 16:09.731
Eh, it's not really
worthy of a phone call,

16:09.766 --> 16:11.533
it's more just information.

16:11.568 --> 16:14.436
You still haven't called
or talked to Camille?

16:14.470 --> 16:15.804
I was hoping she'd call me.

16:15.838 --> 16:17.472
Are you going to tell me
what you're fighting about?

16:17.507 --> 16:19.741
If Iell you, would you then
text her using my cell phone?

16:19.776 --> 16:21.343
Yeah, I guess.

16:21.377 --> 16:22.544
She wants children.

16:22.579 --> 16:26.481
(FAKING SURPRISE) She wants to adopt me?

16:26.516 --> 16:28.650
I didn't think so. I don't
want any more children.

16:28.685 --> 16:31.420
Thanks, Dad. And you told her this?

16:31.454 --> 16:32.654
I think she got the message.

16:32.689 --> 16:33.755
How? Through Betty.

16:33.790 --> 16:35.757
I told Betty and Betty told her

16:35.792 --> 16:37.593
and then I never heard from her again.

16:37.627 --> 16:41.563
It's been too long so...
Do me a favor. Text her.

16:41.598 --> 16:43.532
Or you know what else you could do?

16:43.566 --> 16:45.634
You could pass her a note in class?

16:45.668 --> 16:48.537
Smart ass, just do
it. Come on, hurry up.

16:48.571 --> 16:50.639
What do you want to say?

16:50.673 --> 16:53.375
"Dear Camille..." Never mind, I got it.

16:53.409 --> 16:54.710
I'm just joking.

16:54.744 --> 16:57.512
Apparently the Boykewich men
should just play it straight.

16:58.581 --> 17:00.515
We're not funny.

17:00.550 --> 17:02.484
You may not be funny, but
"Dear Camille," that was funny.

17:04.654 --> 17:07.455
Seriously, we have got to get
Ben away from these people.

17:07.490 --> 17:09.424
What's he doing with
this white trash anyway?

17:09.459 --> 17:11.460
Technically, it's multi-cultural trash.

17:11.493 --> 17:13.729
Well, he needs some
multi-cultural class.

17:14.564 --> 17:16.397
He's a classy guy.

17:17.767 --> 17:19.635
What? He is.

17:19.669 --> 17:22.404
It is hard to defend
getting pregnant and married

17:22.438 --> 17:23.771
and then divorced in high school.

17:23.806 --> 17:27.509
They're bombarded every day with
messages about birth control.

17:27.542 --> 17:29.411
Yeah, so? You're bombarded every day

17:29.445 --> 17:31.580
with the dangers of pot and alcohol.

17:31.614 --> 17:32.748

17:33.816 --> 17:35.684
Oh. I know.

17:35.718 --> 17:37.552
You know what we have to do?

17:37.587 --> 17:40.622
Stop lying about your little
experiments with marijuana and alcohol?

17:40.657 --> 17:42.691
No, no.

17:42.725 --> 17:46.695
We have to get Ben to transfer
to our school next year,

17:46.729 --> 17:48.530
so he can go to a real school.

17:48.564 --> 17:50.465
You're right. He needs to
be in a better environment.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.501
He's a senior.

17:52.535 --> 17:54.436
Yeah, so this is his last chance.

17:54.470 --> 17:57.439
Our school would look way better on his
college applications than his school.

17:57.473 --> 18:00.375
It's a magnet school. It
has a very good reputation.

18:01.711 --> 18:03.612
You're not sure about him, are you?

18:03.646 --> 18:05.480
You don't want him
to come to our school?

18:05.515 --> 18:06.682
Is that it?

18:06.716 --> 18:07.749
No, that's not it.

18:07.784 --> 18:09.551
Then he's coming to our school.

18:14.757 --> 18:17.592
Oh! I thought you knew I was coming.

18:18.561 --> 18:20.429
Didn't you get my text?

18:20.463 --> 18:22.664
No, you got my text.
I know you got my text.

18:22.699 --> 18:24.633
Yeah, but I was already ready for bed.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.668
You sleep alone in that?

18:26.703 --> 18:28.503
You never wore anything
like that when we were...

18:29.772 --> 18:30.806
Never mind.

18:31.841 --> 18:33.542
I'm so happy you texted me.

18:33.576 --> 18:35.377
I have missed you so much.

18:35.411 --> 18:37.746
I have missed you too but
I only want to be friends.

18:37.780 --> 18:41.349
Can we be friends, please,
please, please, Alice?

18:41.384 --> 18:43.418
I'm being friendly.

18:43.486 --> 18:45.687
Be friendly in clothes. Fine.

18:51.694 --> 18:54.362
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

19:03.740 --> 19:06.374
I thought you said you
just wanted to be friends.

19:07.777 --> 19:09.511
It's going to take time.

19:11.547 --> 19:15.484
So if we ever got married,
what day would it be?

19:15.518 --> 19:18.286
Jack, we're never going to get married.

19:18.321 --> 19:19.688
You're going to college,

19:19.722 --> 19:22.290
and then I'm going to another
college the year after that,

19:22.325 --> 19:23.892
and we're not going to see
each other for four years

19:23.926 --> 19:27.496
and then when we do see each other
we're both going to be with other people.

19:27.530 --> 19:29.731
Or we start seeing each other again now,

19:29.766 --> 19:31.566
and not just as friends,

19:31.601 --> 19:34.336
and we can keep seeing each other
until you're out of high school,

19:34.370 --> 19:37.405
and then in my second year and your
first year of college at the same school,

19:37.440 --> 19:38.607
we live together.

19:38.641 --> 19:40.542
And then we move in with
each other in another city

19:40.576 --> 19:42.477
where we both get our first jobs

19:42.512 --> 19:45.347
and then two years later, we
get married and have children,

19:45.381 --> 19:47.682
two girls and a boy, and
we live happily ever after.

19:48.684 --> 19:50.519
I can't do it.

19:50.553 --> 19:52.521
I'm going to medical school

19:52.555 --> 19:54.589
and then I'll have my
residency and all that.

19:54.624 --> 19:56.591
We could figure it out, Grace.

19:56.626 --> 19:58.727
If you wanted to be with
me, we could figure it out.

19:58.761 --> 20:01.463
I just think it's too
soon to figure it out.

20:08.771 --> 20:10.705
I don't believe that you
want to be just friends.

20:11.674 --> 20:13.341
I just...

20:19.582 --> 20:22.384
And I don't believe in the whole
happily ever after thing with you.

20:23.486 --> 20:24.719
I've always loved you.

20:24.754 --> 20:26.621
Jack, stop. I can't...

20:26.656 --> 20:28.323
I have to go home. I
can't do this again.

20:28.357 --> 20:29.457
Just give me a chance, Grace.

20:31.427 --> 20:32.661
I'll think about it.

20:41.470 --> 20:42.771
What can't wait until I leave?

20:42.805 --> 20:45.607
It's Grace. She's on her way home and...

20:45.641 --> 20:48.443
Take your shoes back off.
I'm not done with you yet.

20:48.477 --> 20:50.445
Are you joking around or you're serious?

20:50.479 --> 20:52.714
No, I'm telling Grace to
give us another half hour.

20:52.748 --> 20:54.649
You better make that an
hour, I'm still recovering.

20:54.684 --> 20:56.818
Okay. Another hour.

20:59.589 --> 21:01.723
So, you think we'll be going to
that wedding the fourth of July,

21:01.757 --> 21:03.358
you and me, together?

21:03.392 --> 21:04.526
I don't know, that's a year from now.

21:04.560 --> 21:05.727
I don't even know if I'll be invited.

21:05.761 --> 21:07.362
And if you are, would
I be your plus one?

21:07.396 --> 21:09.431
Is this a question where the answer

21:09.465 --> 21:11.533
gives some indication of
how much I care about you?

21:11.567 --> 21:12.767
I hope so.

21:12.802 --> 21:14.736
I care about you. Good.

21:14.770 --> 21:17.639
I care about you. So,
why don't we do this.

21:17.673 --> 21:22.310
Why don't you and me make a commitment
to only see each other for the next year?

21:22.345 --> 21:24.746
(LAUGHS) Omar, I made a
commitment to be with Ben

21:24.780 --> 21:27.482
for the rest of my
life, and here we are.

21:27.516 --> 21:29.351
Look, Adrian, I don't want to lose you.

21:29.385 --> 21:30.785
And I know you're going to college

21:30.820 --> 21:32.454
and you are going to be surrounded
by guys who want to be with you.

21:32.488 --> 21:33.722
I don't want anyone else to be with you,

21:33.756 --> 21:36.391
I don't want you to be
with anyone else but me.

21:36.425 --> 21:38.627
So, could you make a
one year commitment?

21:38.661 --> 21:40.428
Could you do that? No.

21:41.831 --> 21:44.499
But I could do this.

21:44.533 --> 21:48.470
I promise not to be with any
other man for the next week.

21:48.504 --> 21:50.505
Week? Hear me out.

21:50.539 --> 21:54.409
And if that works out,
and it probably will,

21:54.443 --> 21:57.712
I promise not to be with any
other man for the next month,

21:57.747 --> 21:59.481
and if that works out,

21:59.515 --> 22:02.684
I promise not to be with any
other man for three months,

22:02.718 --> 22:04.352
and et cetera, et cetera...

22:04.387 --> 22:06.354
We work our way up to
the one year commitment.

22:07.356 --> 22:08.523
All right. Deal.

22:09.659 --> 22:11.293
Now, how about the next hour?

22:11.327 --> 22:12.460
Week.

22:12.495 --> 22:14.396
Starting with the next hour.

22:14.430 --> 22:16.402
Oh. Mmm.

22:20.405 --> 22:20.405
+

22:26.737 --> 22:28.438
(CHIMES)

22:28.772 --> 22:30.707
Hi, Leo.

22:30.741 --> 22:34.444
Oh, Camille. I was just texting you.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.479
Yeah, you're getting
pretty good at that.

22:36.514 --> 22:39.516
If you get much better, I won't have
time to drive over between replies.

22:40.618 --> 22:43.419
I just didn't want to call you.

22:43.454 --> 22:46.523
And I certainly didn't have the
nerve to see you face to face.

22:46.557 --> 22:49.659
But it's really good
to see you. Come on in.

22:53.597 --> 22:55.498
Maybe we should talk.

23:03.407 --> 23:04.607
I thought about it

23:04.642 --> 23:06.643
and I just don't want to
have any more children.

23:06.677 --> 23:08.478
Okay.

23:08.512 --> 23:11.414
And I thought about it and I
still would like to have children.

23:12.683 --> 23:14.517
But not if it means losing you.

23:14.552 --> 23:15.818
But I don't want you to be with me

23:15.853 --> 23:19.622
and then later look back
and wish you'd had kids.

23:19.657 --> 23:21.624
It's just that...

23:21.659 --> 23:24.427
I've given up so much of my
life already for you, Leo.

23:24.461 --> 23:28.398
I know you didn't ask me to, but I did

23:28.432 --> 23:31.434
and I just really want to have
a baby before it's too late.

23:31.802 --> 23:33.570
I want children.

23:33.604 --> 23:34.604
Hi, Mom.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.642
I told you before, you're not funny.

23:39.677 --> 23:40.777
Maybe I have a dark sense of humor.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.714
A dork sense of humor?

23:44.748 --> 23:46.549
Maybe that, yes.

23:46.584 --> 23:49.385
I like humor directed internally.

23:49.420 --> 23:52.755
Now get the heck out of here,
I'm trying to talk to Camille.

23:52.790 --> 23:54.557
Good night.

23:59.597 --> 24:01.431
You're so good at raising children.

24:01.465 --> 24:02.699
Funny. No, you are.

24:04.668 --> 24:07.337
Camille, this is just
one of those things.

24:07.371 --> 24:08.638
I'm crazy about you,

24:09.773 --> 24:14.310
but I cannot be a
father again at this age.

24:14.345 --> 24:16.512
I don't even know if I can
be a father for one more year

24:16.547 --> 24:20.550
until Ben graduates high
school and gets into college.

24:20.584 --> 24:23.653
Which I hope is out of the
country. I need a break.

24:23.687 --> 24:27.557
I cannot sign up for
another 18 years of this.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.659
We could adopt a nine-year-old,
split the difference.

24:30.794 --> 24:32.795
I told you how I feel.

24:32.830 --> 24:35.431
I wish I didn't feel this way but I do.

24:35.466 --> 24:36.699
Well, how do you feel about me?

24:36.734 --> 24:39.602
You, I'm crazy about.

24:40.838 --> 24:42.505
Leo...

24:43.540 --> 24:44.607
I'm pregnant.

24:46.477 --> 24:48.478
No, not really. (LAUGHS)

24:48.512 --> 24:50.680
No, not really. I just
have a wicked sense of humor

24:50.714 --> 24:52.682
You could have given me a heart attack.

24:52.716 --> 24:55.652
No, I know you. You
have a very strong heart.

24:57.588 --> 25:01.291
I'm not sure what you mean by that.

25:01.325 --> 25:05.361
I mean I want to sleep over.

25:21.478 --> 25:24.580
So your dad said I can sleep over?

25:24.615 --> 25:26.416
No, I didn't get to ask him,

25:26.450 --> 25:28.351
he just told me to get
the hell out of Dodge

25:28.385 --> 25:29.752
'cause he was talking to Camille.

25:33.757 --> 25:36.693
But you have to call your parents.

25:36.727 --> 25:39.595
I did. While you were
talking to your dad.

25:39.630 --> 25:41.597
And you got both of them on the phone

25:41.632 --> 25:44.434
and your mom and your dad
said you can sleep over?

25:44.468 --> 25:45.702
Yes.

25:45.736 --> 25:47.570
All right, well,

25:47.604 --> 25:50.440
we'll make out for another half
hour then I'll drive you home,

25:50.474 --> 25:52.742
because I'm getting much better
at telling when you're lying.

25:52.776 --> 25:55.311
I wasn't lying.

25:55.346 --> 25:57.647
I was stretching the truth.

25:57.681 --> 26:00.650
They said I could sleep
over at Mercedes' house.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.518
LEO: Take her home. Promise.

26:07.424 --> 26:08.558
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

26:08.592 --> 26:09.592
What?

26:12.596 --> 26:13.730
Hello.

26:13.764 --> 26:15.365
We can come back later.

26:15.399 --> 26:17.633
No, please. We weren't doing anything.

26:17.668 --> 26:20.269
It's Alice and Henry, right?

26:20.304 --> 26:21.437
Right.

26:21.472 --> 26:24.273
You texted me so, uh, I hope that meant

26:24.308 --> 26:26.342
there's at least some possibility
we can be friends again.

26:26.377 --> 26:28.378
Alice says she and I
can be friends again.

26:28.412 --> 26:30.513
I told him to text you.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.615
Well, you didn't exactly tell me to.

26:32.649 --> 26:34.717
You suggested I text Henry.

26:34.752 --> 26:36.619
No, I told you to text him

26:36.653 --> 26:39.355
because I want you and
Henry to be friends.

26:39.390 --> 26:40.623
Ben's used to being bossed around.

26:40.657 --> 26:42.458
He's used to me bossing
him around anyway.

26:42.493 --> 26:44.427
Well, now I'm bossing him around.

26:44.461 --> 26:46.362
No one bosses me around.

26:46.397 --> 26:49.599
LEO: Take her home now and
get rid of the other two.

26:49.633 --> 26:50.767
Welcome back, Henry.

26:50.801 --> 26:52.735
We could go down to the rec room.

26:52.770 --> 26:54.604
We were just down there with my friends.

26:54.638 --> 26:57.340
Well, now we can go down
there with Ben's friends.

26:57.374 --> 26:58.641
You still need me.

27:00.744 --> 27:03.579
The guest house is empty,
we could go there. Oh, yes.

27:06.383 --> 27:07.483
Hi, Grace.

27:09.520 --> 27:10.520
Hey.

27:12.322 --> 27:13.356
How are you?

27:14.591 --> 27:17.360
I guess I'd say I'm surprised.

27:17.394 --> 27:18.728
Then again, not at all surprised.

27:20.297 --> 27:22.698
I'd just dropped by to, um...

27:22.733 --> 27:24.700
Say hello to your mom,

27:24.735 --> 27:27.370
see how things are going
with your brother...

27:28.739 --> 27:30.506
You buying any of that? Not really.

27:30.541 --> 27:33.643
Okay, well, good to see you again.

27:34.745 --> 27:36.512
Good night, Kathleen. Wait.

27:38.315 --> 27:40.383
Grace, did you want something?

27:40.417 --> 27:41.751
Yeah, I just wanted to kill an hour.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.586
Adrian is with Omar,

27:43.620 --> 27:45.588
but it turns out, I'd rather have
seen them than the two of you.

27:46.623 --> 27:48.558
Good night. Good night.

27:59.303 --> 28:02.405
So, Adrian is with Omar, huh?

28:02.439 --> 28:03.573
Yeah.

28:03.607 --> 28:05.508
I was just over at Jack's.

28:05.542 --> 28:08.644
I don't know how that's going to work
out though, being friends with Jack.

28:08.679 --> 28:10.480
Well you never know,

28:10.514 --> 28:12.515
it's working out with my
being friends with George.

28:12.549 --> 28:15.451
Mom, you're still married
and he's still whatever he is.

28:15.486 --> 28:18.254
Okay, well then, when I'm not married,

28:18.288 --> 28:20.389
and he's still whatever he is,

28:20.424 --> 28:23.659
are you going to be okay
with my seeing George?

28:23.694 --> 28:25.695
Because I'm really happy
when I'm with George.

28:25.729 --> 28:29.432
Mom, he's been on and off
with Amy's mom for years.

28:29.466 --> 28:31.467
What if you fall in love with him again,

28:31.502 --> 28:33.402
or worse, what if you
have sex with him again

28:33.437 --> 28:34.737
and he goes back to her again?

28:34.771 --> 28:38.608
(LAUGHS) Well, I don't think
that that is going to happen.

28:38.642 --> 28:42.478
In fact, he's already told her
that that's not going to happen.

28:42.546 --> 28:45.515
Honey, I know that that
is not going to happen.

28:45.549 --> 28:46.716
How do you know?

28:46.750 --> 28:48.351
I just know.

28:48.385 --> 28:49.652
No, you don't. No, I do.

28:51.321 --> 28:52.722
As it turns out, Anne is...

28:54.458 --> 28:56.759
You can't say anything
to Amy about this.

28:56.793 --> 28:57.793
About what?

28:58.762 --> 29:00.563
Anne is gay.

29:15.546 --> 29:16.679
(SIGHS)

29:16.713 --> 29:18.514
I hope this doesn't get out.

29:23.980 --> 29:23.980
+

29:29.181 --> 29:31.248
Oh. Hi. Oh, no.

29:31.283 --> 29:34.485
Oh. Geez, we've overslept,
we've got school.

29:34.519 --> 29:37.188
Who are you? Mercedes.

29:37.222 --> 29:39.357
Your mom called, she's
got that wedding today

29:39.391 --> 29:42.627
so she was leaving the house and
your dad's already left for work.

29:42.661 --> 29:44.328
I told her you were in the shower

29:44.363 --> 29:46.430
and that we were going for
breakfast before I take you home

29:46.465 --> 29:48.199
since my dad doesn't really cook.

29:48.233 --> 29:49.333
Perfect.

29:49.368 --> 29:50.601
And they don't question these lies?

29:50.636 --> 29:54.372
No. It's not lying, really.

29:54.406 --> 29:55.439
It's more...

29:55.474 --> 29:57.341
Fabricating an alternate reality.

29:57.376 --> 29:58.442
She was never here.

30:03.281 --> 30:06.283
Good night. I mean, day.

30:06.318 --> 30:07.685
Bye, Henry and Alice.

30:07.719 --> 30:10.588
And keep thinking about
transferring to our school.

30:11.723 --> 30:14.425
Bye. See ya.

30:14.459 --> 30:17.428
You're thinking of transferring to
their school in your senior year?

30:17.462 --> 30:20.598
No. You can't do that. It's like
old times. We just spent the night.

30:20.632 --> 30:21.632
Things are normal again.

30:21.667 --> 30:23.501
I'm just thinking about it.

30:23.535 --> 30:26.337
<i>Ben, do you not realize that this
girl is your Fatal Attraction?</i>

30:26.371 --> 30:28.406
<i>I don't think I'd say
she's my Fatal Attraction,</i>

30:28.440 --> 30:32.643
<i>but maybe she's more my,
uh...    Basic Instinct.</i>

30:34.379 --> 30:35.680
Let's go, Henry.

30:37.282 --> 30:38.282
Uh...

30:40.385 --> 30:41.552
It's going to take time.

30:44.656 --> 30:46.323
(KNOCKING)

30:49.528 --> 30:51.295
Good morning.

30:52.397 --> 30:54.231
Say good morning, Ethan.

30:54.266 --> 30:56.200
You don't have to keep telling me
that, I know to say good morning.

30:56.234 --> 30:57.334
Well?

30:57.369 --> 30:58.469
Good morning.

30:58.503 --> 31:01.272
I was on my way to drop Ethan off

31:01.306 --> 31:03.507
and I remembered I have a
little gift for you and Amy.

31:03.542 --> 31:04.575
A gift?

31:04.609 --> 31:07.211
You did tell me you set a date?

31:07.245 --> 31:08.512
People get a gift for setting a date?

31:08.547 --> 31:10.581
Well, Amy does. Where is she?

31:10.615 --> 31:13.284
Didn't you tell her
that we were stopping by?

31:13.318 --> 31:16.487
Yeah, but uh... She had to leave
early to take John by the nursery.

31:16.521 --> 31:18.322
And she wanted to drop by her dad's.

31:18.356 --> 31:21.358
I love the idea of the fourth of July.

31:21.393 --> 31:22.493
It's kind of corny.

31:22.527 --> 31:25.396
It is not corny. Well,
it's not romantic.

31:25.430 --> 31:27.531
(SIGHS) Sure it is.

31:27.566 --> 31:30.634
Why the fourth of July?

31:30.669 --> 31:32.636
I don't know, Amy just picked it.

31:32.671 --> 31:34.438
Is Amy patriotic?

31:34.473 --> 31:37.541
(LAUGHS) More like idiotic. It's
an idiotic day to get married.

31:37.576 --> 31:39.376
The Ides of March
would be a better date.

31:40.312 --> 31:41.412
The Ides of March?

31:41.446 --> 31:43.614
He's studying Shakespeare.

31:43.648 --> 31:44.682
Well, good for him.

31:45.584 --> 31:47.284
Give this to Amy.

31:47.652 --> 31:49.420
What is it?

31:49.454 --> 31:52.623
It's a calendar so she can mark
off the days till the wedding.

31:52.657 --> 31:55.626
I mean, it took her long
enough to come up with a day,

31:55.660 --> 31:57.461
and whether it's good or bad,

31:57.496 --> 31:59.396
at least now you have a date.

31:59.431 --> 32:01.632
You know, it took me a long
time to decide to marry her,

32:01.666 --> 32:03.434
so I don't care that
it took her a few weeks,

32:03.468 --> 32:05.369
couple of months,
whatever, to set a date.

32:05.403 --> 32:06.637
Yeah, you do. Shut up.

32:06.671 --> 32:08.239
Ricky!

32:08.273 --> 32:09.507
What? I'm happy.

32:09.541 --> 32:12.243
You don't sound happy. Ethan.

32:12.277 --> 32:13.544
I've just got a lot on my mind, okay?

32:13.578 --> 32:16.480
Like now you've got two
gay moms in the family?

32:16.515 --> 32:18.415
What are you talking about? I'm not gay.

32:18.450 --> 32:20.384
The other one. Nora is gay.

32:20.418 --> 32:22.620
That's not two gay
moms, that's one gay mom.

32:22.654 --> 32:25.256
Apparently people think
Amy's mom is gay, too.

32:25.290 --> 32:27.391
But she's not. It's just a rumor.

32:27.425 --> 32:29.627
Of course it is, otherwise I would know.

32:31.263 --> 32:32.696
Where did you hear such a thing?

32:32.731 --> 32:34.398
From Grace's brother.

32:34.432 --> 32:37.468
George told Kathleen,
Kathleen told Grace and...

32:39.271 --> 32:40.538
Okay, he just overheard.

32:40.572 --> 32:43.407
She's not gay. Or maybe she is.

32:43.441 --> 32:44.608
Nobody knows.

32:46.511 --> 32:48.445
Okay. I just thought of something.

32:48.480 --> 32:49.647
What if my mom was just drunk?

32:49.681 --> 32:51.482
What if she had no idea
of what she was saying?

32:51.516 --> 32:53.384
Then you're in a lot of trouble.

32:53.418 --> 32:54.585
Well you didn't tell anybody, did you?

32:54.619 --> 32:56.554
Who would I tell? Did you?

32:56.588 --> 32:58.422
Just Omar. And I'm not
even sure if he heard me.

32:58.456 --> 32:59.557
Why not?

32:59.591 --> 33:01.392
Why don't you call your mom

33:01.426 --> 33:03.427
see how she's doing this morning,

33:03.461 --> 33:06.263
and, you know, just confirm
that she said what she said.

33:06.298 --> 33:07.331
That's a good idea.

33:07.365 --> 33:08.632
You're driving yourself
to school, right?

33:08.667 --> 33:10.267
Right.

33:13.238 --> 33:14.305
(SIGHS)

33:18.376 --> 33:19.577
(BUZZING)

33:20.545 --> 33:22.346
Hello? Mom?

33:22.380 --> 33:25.583
Who is this? It's me,
Grace, your daughter?

33:25.617 --> 33:27.351
I'm just kidding.
Honey, what's going on?

33:27.385 --> 33:30.321
I just wanted to see if you were okay.

33:30.355 --> 33:33.257
Yes, I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?

33:33.291 --> 33:35.492
I don't know. You were
drinking last night.

33:35.527 --> 33:38.262
<i>I had a couple of
glasses of wine, honey.</i>

33:38.296 --> 33:40.598
So, you're aware of what you told me.

33:40.632 --> 33:42.299
About Amy's mom.

33:42.334 --> 33:44.201
Yes, I'm aware.

33:44.236 --> 33:48.539
And you're aware that I told you
not to say anything to anyone, right?

33:49.608 --> 33:52.176
Right. Oh, Grace.

33:52.244 --> 33:54.378
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

33:54.412 --> 33:57.414
(SCOFFS) Who would I tell?
I have to get to school.

34:05.290 --> 34:06.523
(GROANS)

34:15.634 --> 34:17.268
(EXHALES)

34:19.304 --> 34:21.205
Good morning. Good morning.

34:21.239 --> 34:23.407
Those practices get earlier and earlier.

34:23.440 --> 34:26.443
It's August. It's hot. Coach
has us coming in at sunrise.

34:26.478 --> 34:29.246
Yeah. You doing okay with the team?

34:29.281 --> 34:31.382
Yeah, I mean, I don't think
I'm going to be a starter,

34:31.416 --> 34:33.484
but maybe by next season.
Or if someone gets injured.

34:33.518 --> 34:35.386
Well, that's good, that's good.

34:35.420 --> 34:37.388
This is a whole other level of playing.

34:37.422 --> 34:38.522
College ball.

34:38.556 --> 34:40.491
It's a whole new level of hurt, too.

34:40.525 --> 34:42.426
Yeah.

34:42.460 --> 34:44.495
So, Grace came by last night.
Everything go all right?

34:46.297 --> 34:47.498
We're just friends.

34:47.532 --> 34:49.400
Just friends, huh?

34:49.434 --> 34:51.568
Well, I know that's not what you want,

34:51.603 --> 34:54.271
but maybe that'll change.

34:54.306 --> 34:55.371
Hey, listen, did you hear about...

34:55.407 --> 34:57.441
Yeah, I heard, too. Yeah?

34:57.475 --> 34:59.209
So, she's finally committing.

34:59.244 --> 35:00.444
Committing?

35:00.478 --> 35:04.214
Yeah. Making a declaration of love,

35:04.249 --> 35:06.483
a lifetime decision, that's committing.

35:06.518 --> 35:09.653
I was thinking of it more
as she's choosing her team.

35:11.222 --> 35:12.222
Amy?

35:12.524 --> 35:14.491
Amy's mother.

35:14.526 --> 35:16.460
Oh, so Amy's mother's getting married.

35:16.494 --> 35:19.196
I thought it was Amy
on the fourth of July.

35:19.230 --> 35:21.298
I thought we were talking
about something else.

35:21.333 --> 35:22.599
So did I.

35:22.634 --> 35:26.437
But the important thing
is, we're communicating.

35:26.471 --> 35:28.439
Everyone needs face time.

35:28.473 --> 35:31.175
It's much better than all
that texting and tweeting

35:31.209 --> 35:33.644
and electronic mailing and
all that other razzmatazz.

35:33.678 --> 35:35.512
Things can get lost in translation.

35:37.349 --> 35:38.582
Have a nice day.

35:42.354 --> 35:45.189
If Amy and Ricky need
someone to officiate,

35:45.223 --> 35:46.357
I'd love to preside.

35:46.391 --> 35:48.158
All right.

35:48.193 --> 35:50.427
And if Amy's mother ever decides
that she wants to get married again,

35:50.462 --> 35:52.363
I am a proponent of gay marriage.

35:56.568 --> 35:58.202
Oh, no.

36:00.605 --> 36:04.308
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

36:04.342 --> 36:07.177
Amy is really going to
hate her new stepsister.

36:08.595 --> 36:08.595
+

36:09.251 --> 36:11.525
- Good morning.
- I am so sorry.

36:11.757 --> 36:12.293
Sorry about what?

36:13.597 --> 36:16.613
That you didn't get to stay longer.

36:17.125 --> 36:18.934
Me, too. But probably for the best.

36:19.109 --> 36:20.733
Nora was still awake when I got home,

36:20.733 --> 36:22.645
just standing over the
crib staring at the kid.

36:22.818 --> 36:24.136
She was too scared to go to sleep.

36:24.491 --> 36:26.772
'Course if the kid woke up, he'd
be too scared to sleep again.

36:27.654 --> 36:28.437
Oh, funny.

36:28.679 --> 36:32.399
Uh, so... When is Anne coming home?

36:32.671 --> 36:34.086
I don't know. I hope soon.

36:34.186 --> 36:35.742
I love Robie, but I need some me time.

36:35.902 --> 36:36.912
Me and you time.

36:37.184 --> 36:39.223
Well, I hope you still
feel the same way,

36:39.462 --> 36:40.974
after I tell you this.

36:42.383 --> 36:45.221
Okay, so do not let
her know that we know.

36:45.423 --> 36:47.576
Right. We're just going to
talk about the usual stuff.

36:48.360 --> 36:50.448
Her. Right.

36:50.701 --> 36:51.747
But we can't be angry with her

36:51.847 --> 36:54.834
just because we once again are
focusing our lives around her drama.

36:55.147 --> 36:56.866
No. Because this is not really her,

36:57.010 --> 36:58.738
it's just something that
is going on in her life.

36:59.121 --> 37:01.529
Or it will be when her mother gets back.

37:01.683 --> 37:03.272
Of course, it's still not about us.

37:03.441 --> 37:04.353
You think she knows?

37:04.529 --> 37:05.521
Uh... Yeah.

37:05.737 --> 37:07.704
And I think she's having
some sort of issue with it

37:07.841 --> 37:11.168
otherwise she would have told us and we
would have found out before Grace found out.

37:11.415 --> 37:13.976
Well, it's a possibility
that Grace is wrong.

37:14.216 --> 37:15.288
She heard it from her mother.

37:15.520 --> 37:18.781
Yeah, but she heard it from
Amy's father. And he's an idiot.

37:20.758 --> 37:22.446
Hey.

37:22.736 --> 37:23.905
Hey. Hey.

37:24.112 --> 37:26.276
So, what's going on?

37:26.421 --> 37:28.155
Nothing. Nothing.

37:28.189 --> 37:29.323
Just waiting for Amy.

37:29.357 --> 37:31.125
Oh? Why's that?

37:31.159 --> 37:33.093
No reason.

37:33.128 --> 37:35.129
Yeah, in case you haven't
heard, we're friends again.

37:35.163 --> 37:37.998
Yeah, I heard, I just didn't care.

37:38.032 --> 37:41.201
Well, well, well, speaking
of friends again...

37:41.236 --> 37:42.336
What's going on, Benny?

37:42.370 --> 37:43.971
You want to know what's going on?

37:44.005 --> 37:45.305
No, it was a rhetorical question.

37:45.340 --> 37:47.341
Another week and I am out of here

37:47.375 --> 37:50.410
and the rest of you are
still in high school.

37:50.445 --> 37:53.013
Ben's thinking of transferring.

37:53.047 --> 37:54.414
Transferring? Where?

37:54.449 --> 37:57.317
Oh, is this the part
where I speak for myself?

37:57.352 --> 37:59.186
I'm thinking about
transferring high schools.

37:59.220 --> 38:01.388
The idea was thrown out
there, I'm just considering it.

38:01.422 --> 38:04.258
Oh, please don't tell me
you'd actually transfer schools

38:04.292 --> 38:06.093
to be with that pot-smoking skank?

38:06.127 --> 38:07.427
Yes. It's a possibility.

38:07.462 --> 38:09.062
Have you lost your mind?

38:09.097 --> 38:10.397
Hey, you can't talk
about my friend that way.

38:13.134 --> 38:14.268
I'm a little out of practice.

38:15.336 --> 38:16.370
Is Amy here yet?

38:16.404 --> 38:17.404
Why? What's going on now?

38:17.438 --> 38:19.072
You all know what is going on.

38:19.107 --> 38:20.274
Thanks to you, yes.

38:20.308 --> 38:22.109
Have you talked to your mother? Yes.

38:22.143 --> 38:24.378
And I just want to say that
I shouldn't have said anything

38:24.412 --> 38:26.079
and I'm really sorry I did.

38:26.114 --> 38:28.515
And we should all just forget about it.

38:31.419 --> 38:33.320
Please, you guys, I'm begging
you. Please, please, please.

38:33.354 --> 38:35.022
If you're Amy's friends at all,

38:35.056 --> 38:37.424
please don't say anything
about Amy's mother being gay.

38:37.458 --> 38:39.393
Let's just talk about the wedding.

38:39.427 --> 38:41.028
Let's talk about the fourth of July.

38:41.062 --> 38:43.163
It's such a stupid day to get married.

38:44.165 --> 38:45.399
Yeah, it is. Yeah, it really is.

38:45.433 --> 38:47.100
(ALL AGREEING)

38:49.003 --> 38:51.038
You told Kathleen that Mom is gay?

38:51.072 --> 38:52.606
Morning.

38:52.640 --> 38:55.042
I, uh... I think my ear is a little
clogged up from an earlier phone call.

38:55.076 --> 38:56.109
What'd you say?

38:56.144 --> 38:57.377
(LOUDER) Are you telling
people that Mom...

38:57.412 --> 38:59.079
What? I can't hear you.

39:03.184 --> 39:04.384
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

39:09.224 --> 39:11.191
(SIGHS) I only told Kathleen.

39:11.226 --> 39:13.160
And only to make her feel
better about her marriage ending.

39:13.194 --> 39:15.329
How would that make her feel
better about her marriage ending?

39:15.363 --> 39:18.265
Well, at least her husband
didn't turn her gay.

39:18.299 --> 39:21.301
(CLEARS THROAT) Good morning, Amy.

39:21.336 --> 39:23.303
No one turns anyone,
okay? I beg to differ.

39:23.338 --> 39:25.038
You don't know anything about it.

39:25.073 --> 39:27.040
I don't know if you know
anything about anything.

39:27.075 --> 39:28.275
You were married.

39:28.309 --> 39:30.377
Your husband beat the crap
out of you and you turned.

39:30.411 --> 39:34.448
First of all, congratulations on
basically comparing yourself to my husband

39:34.482 --> 39:37.150
as someone who turns women gay.

39:37.185 --> 39:39.052
Idiot, and second of all,

39:39.087 --> 39:40.187
I was gay.

39:40.221 --> 39:42.189
I did not have the courage
to be gay at the time

39:42.223 --> 39:44.458
and I got married and my
husband beat the crap out of me

39:44.492 --> 39:46.393
and I was still gay and I still am.

39:48.196 --> 39:51.265
And thirdly, Amy, your mom
hasn't said that she's gay.

39:51.299 --> 39:54.301
I know but she says
she's not gay so much...

39:54.335 --> 39:58.171
I know, but there may be many
different reasons for that.

39:58.206 --> 40:01.041
And your father here wants
to believe that she's gay

40:01.075 --> 40:04.411
so he doesn't have to feel
guilty about seeing Kathleen.

40:04.445 --> 40:06.113
Well, you should feel guilty.

40:08.182 --> 40:11.418
Anyway, congratulations on
setting a date for your wedding.

40:11.452 --> 40:13.320
I love the fourth of July.

40:13.354 --> 40:18.125
I even bought Ricky some
flag underwear last year.

40:18.477 --> 40:19.644
Yeah.

40:20.836 --> 40:21.804
Bye.

40:24.365 --> 40:25.499
Thanks, Mom.

40:26.501 --> 40:28.135
(SIGHS)

40:28.536 --> 40:30.370
Everyone knows. Everyone.

40:30.405 --> 40:33.173
How does everyone know? Duh, texting.

40:33.207 --> 40:35.342
I don't even know. I
just told Kathleen that...

40:35.376 --> 40:37.311
I thought your mom might be gay.

40:37.345 --> 40:39.046
Do you realize that Mom is
going to come home next week

40:39.080 --> 40:41.081
and everyone is going
to be talking about this?

40:41.115 --> 40:43.116
No. By next week, they'll be
talking about something new.

40:43.151 --> 40:45.152
Dad, it was wrong of you to say anything

40:45.186 --> 40:47.220
because this is Mom's personal business

40:47.255 --> 40:48.388
and because you don't know!

40:48.423 --> 40:51.191
You can't know, no one
can unless Mom says so.

40:51.225 --> 40:53.060
Yeah, but I got a hunch.

40:52.587 --> 40:55.235
Just like I got a hunch that you
set a date that's more of a deadline.

40:55.420 --> 40:56.187
What?

40:57.065 --> 40:59.066
I don't think you know if you
really want to get married,

40:59.100 --> 41:02.135
so you figure you'd set a date and
try to talk yourself into it by then.

41:02.170 --> 41:04.237
Nora's right. You don't
know anything about anything.

41:10.445 --> 41:16.138
