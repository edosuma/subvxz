00:03.178 --> 00:04.139
With the Hayworths
living so near each other,

00:04.219 --> 00:05.441
it was easy for the cousins

00:05.541 --> 00:06.722
to spend quality time
together,

00:06.822 --> 00:09.285
or at the very least,
time together.

00:09.385 --> 00:11.327
- These are the moments
they'll treasure.

00:11.427 --> 00:12.889
- Hey, guys.

00:12.989 --> 00:14.992
There's a bear
in the apartment!

00:16.353 --> 00:17.895
- Your plates are so shiny.

00:17.995 --> 00:19.497

I got them for Denise.

00:19.597 --> 00:22.661
This artist that we love
upcycles artifacts of violence.

00:22.761 --> 00:25.464
These used to be
tear gas canisters.

00:25.564 --> 00:27.466
- Imagine my delight
Christmas morning.

00:27.566 --> 00:28.988
- Hey, are you guys free
on Friday?

00:29.088 --> 00:31.431
I'm throwing a birthday dinner
for Emily.

00:31.531 --> 00:32.832
- Emily, your ex-wife, Emily?

00:32.932 --> 00:34.554
- No, the Emily
that threads my brows.

00:34.654 --> 00:36.356
Yes, that Emily.

00:36.456 --> 00:37.558
Now that she's fully
moved down here,

00:37.658 --> 00:38.959
we gotta learn to get along,
you know?

00:39.059 --> 00:40.641
- That's a very
healthy attitude,

00:40.741 --> 00:43.925
considering you used to be
a little competitive.

00:44.025 --> 00:45.567
- No, we were
a lot competitive.

00:45.667 --> 00:47.609
- I'm never fully comfortable
around Emily.

00:47.709 --> 00:48.971
She's like a beautiful
ice sculpture

00:49.071 --> 00:50.533
that burns when you touch it.

00:50.633 --> 00:52.535
- Yeah, I always got the sense
she didn't like me,

00:52.635 --> 00:55.418
mostly 'cause she was always
very mean to me.

00:55.518 --> 00:59.223
- I kind of miss Emily's
pushy, boss-lady confidence

00:59.323 --> 01:02.787
and how she's just
so unapologetic about her power

01:02.887 --> 01:06.591
and--but Team Connor.

01:06.691 --> 01:09.034
- Is she bringing that guy
that she's been seeing?

01:09.134 --> 01:10.916
- Who? Alec?

01:11.016 --> 01:12.959
I don't know. She didn't say,
and I didn't ask.

01:13.059 --> 01:15.361
But if he shows up,
that's totally fine.

01:15.461 --> 01:16.463
You know, what, do you think
I'm, like, worried

01:16.543 --> 01:19.967
that he's gonna
be more successful

01:20.067 --> 01:22.890
and better looking than me
and, you know,

01:22.990 --> 01:24.892
maybe have a house
owned by a different,

01:24.992 --> 01:26.614
more famous celebrity?

01:26.714 --> 01:28.176
Those aren't things
I think about.

01:28.276 --> 01:30.459

because you want our,

01:30.559 --> 01:33.102
you know, emotional support,
of course we will be there.

01:33.202 --> 01:36.185
- No, I'm inviting you because
I ordered too much shrimp.

01:36.285 --> 01:37.627
- Hmm.

01:37.727 --> 01:40.190

A dinner in her honor,

01:54.667 --> 01:56.409

being fashionably late.

You have a crush on her.

01:58.191 --> 01:59.132

Better than great.

have ice cream for dinner!

with fruit on top.

- No, it was gummy worms.

I was very popular

03:58.850 --> 03:59.951

was a long time ago.

Okay. Game on.

or silk pillowcase for Emily?

- Actually, I went
a different way.

04:35.653 --> 04:37.935
I got her "An Oral History of
the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire."

04:39.457 --> 04:41.039
It's a book
from a used bookstore.

04:41.139 --> 04:43.001
- You got a woman who owns
a Prada toothbrush

04:43.101 --> 04:45.484
a pre-owned book about people
who died in a sweatshop?

04:45.584 --> 04:47.286
- No, I saved a tree

04:47.386 --> 04:49.789
while sharing an important
moment in U.S. labor history.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.492
What? I would love this
if someone gave it to me.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.094
- Of course
you would love this

04:54.194 --> 04:55.736
because you enjoy this stuff.

04:55.836 --> 04:57.378
- I feel like you
are not saying something.

04:57.478 --> 04:58.980
- Okay.

04:59.080 --> 05:02.103
For my last birthday,
I strongly hinted

05:02.203 --> 05:03.425
that I wanted bath bombs

05:03.525 --> 05:06.789
by telling you,
"I want bath bombs,"

05:06.889 --> 05:08.190
and instead, you got me--

05:08.290 --> 05:10.793
- That adorable bralette
made of natural fibers.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.196
- It was a burlap bralette
that was very itchy.

05:13.296 --> 05:15.318
I'm just concerned
it's gonna be an awkward moment

05:15.418 --> 05:17.681

your sweatshop book

05:17.781 --> 05:19.163

What, is she five?

05:21.986 --> 05:23.808

05:23.908 --> 05:26.351

by social norms and...

05:34.280 --> 05:36.022
What did you get Emily
for her birthday?

05:36.122 --> 05:38.185
- Oh, a bottle of perfume.

05:38.285 --> 05:39.907
- Yeah, we know it's her
favorite 'cause one time

05:40.007 --> 05:43.391
she sprayed it in my face when
she thought I was a mugger.

05:43.491 --> 05:44.793
It was pretty clear it was me.

05:44.893 --> 05:47.355
I mean, it was
in broad daylight.

05:47.455 --> 05:50.239
- Denise thinks that Emily
is going to hate my gift,

05:50.339 --> 05:52.341
but you guys always like
what I get you, right?

05:53.222 --> 05:55.525
- Oh, my God. Yeah. Totally.
- Mm.

has Sarah given you

05:57.347 --> 05:58.649

that you just love so much?

05:58.749 --> 05:59.810
- Yeah.

05:59.910 --> 06:01.051
- Specifically?
- Mm-hmm.

06:01.151 --> 06:02.293
- Hmm...
- So many.

06:02.393 --> 06:04.255
- Yeah, it's hard
to choose just one.

06:04.355 --> 06:05.777
- You can pick as many
as you want.

06:05.877 --> 06:07.098
- Thanks, Denise.

06:07.198 --> 06:10.222
I would say
the charcoal deodorant

06:10.322 --> 06:13.466
definitely worked
and did not give me a rash.

06:13.566 --> 06:15.308
- Yes. Tempeh cookbook.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.991
- "Tempeh to Z," a classic.

06:18.091 --> 06:19.593
- She loved it.
- Oh, good.

06:19.693 --> 06:22.756
So, if pressed, would you say

06:22.856 --> 06:26.240
that my gift giving
is, I don't know...

06:26.340 --> 06:28.163
- You...unique.
- You.

06:28.263 --> 06:29.324

both: Unique.

06:29.424 --> 06:31.046
- Oh, that's so nice.

06:32.227 --> 06:33.969

- Oh.

06:34.069 --> 06:36.252
- So we're just gonna go
over here.

06:36.352 --> 06:38.695
- Okay, I'm gonna go
ask Connor.

06:38.795 --> 06:40.797
- Sure.
Let's keep digging this hole.

- Target acquired,
J.A.R.V.I.S.

J.A.R.V.I.S.,
Iron Man's operating system.

06:47.245 --> 06:49.707
- You should definitely talk
to her about Iron Man

06:49.807 --> 06:51.309
and all that cool stuff
in the comics

06:51.409 --> 06:52.991
that was left out
of the movies.

throw her underwear at you.

to pledge myself, but--

do well with hazings.

What do you do for a living?
- I'm in real estate.

- Okay. That must be great
in the San Francisco market.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.463
- It is, but I'm actually
looking to expand

07:20.563 --> 07:21.785
further outside the city.

07:21.885 --> 07:23.306
- Oh, okay.

07:23.406 --> 07:24.788
It's "farther."

07:24.888 --> 07:26.270
- I'm sorry, what?

07:26.370 --> 07:28.192
- It was just, uh,
you said "further."

07:28.292 --> 07:30.274
I think you meant "farther."
It's a common mistake.

07:30.374 --> 07:32.757
Farther
is for physical distance.

07:32.857 --> 07:34.439
But it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

I need to get

07:37.142 --> 07:39.405
a little farther away from you.

07:39.505 --> 07:42.789

It's a sick burn.

07:43.510 --> 07:46.173
Ah. So close to five minutes.

07:46.273 --> 07:48.936
- You made it--
56, 57, 58 seconds.

- Look, I'm just
getting started, okay.

07:50.678 --> 07:51.859

- Oh.

- I'm going back in.

- Okay.

07:54.602 --> 07:55.784
- Actually, give that to me.
